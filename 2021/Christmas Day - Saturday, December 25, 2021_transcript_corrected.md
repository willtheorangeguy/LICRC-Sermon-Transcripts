[1752.26 → 1756.92] another voice long remembered echoes through the chaos of the years.
[1757.80 → 1759.72] The voice of one who knows.
[1761.06 → 1764.18] One who was born into a world of chaos and weariness.
[1765.16 → 1767.94] His voice still speaks with comforting clarity.
[1769.02 → 1772.12] And so, we celebrate his coming once again.
[1772.88 → 1776.48] His coming into a broken world and into broken hearts.
[1776.48 → 1783.12] He stills our anxiousness with words that carry on into eternity.
[1784.50 → 1785.86] Peace I leave with you.
[1786.14 → 1787.74] My peace I give to you.
[1788.34 → 1790.52] I do not give to you as the world gives.
[1791.40 → 1793.52] Do not let your hearts be troubled.
[1794.02 → 1795.54] And do not be afraid.
[1795.54 → 1795.70] Thank you.
[1795.70 → 1797.70] Thank you.

[2037.48 → 2051.48] God of all creation, here with us in a starlit manger, Emmanuel.

[2240.28 → 2245.28] O come let us adore.
[2245.28 → 2246.28] Morning.
[2246.28 → 2266.28] We're going to spend some time hearing again, or maybe for the first time, the Christmas story.
[2266.28 → 2271.18] We're going to read that in our Bibles from Matthew chapter 1.
[2271.78 → 2280.88] I'm going to read verse 18 through 24, Matthew's quick Christmas story there.
[2280.96 → 2282.24] It's going to be on the screen behind me.
[2282.32 → 2283.22] You can probably see it already.
[2283.70 → 2289.36] I encourage you, if you have a Bible, to have that in your hands, open, on your device or whatever,
[2289.66 → 2296.10] and you can read along there and then keep it with you as we come into the text.
[2296.28 → 2302.10] With the text open in front of you, let's pray together.
[2305.08 → 2312.42] Holy God, Heavenly Father, speak now your Christmas words to us.
[2313.70 → 2325.58] Speak now the hope, the love, the joy, and the peace that you might bring into the chaos of our lives.
[2327.10 → 2331.88] Speak now with your voice that we might hear you in this word.
[2332.60 → 2335.98] That we might go from here today praising your name,
[2336.76 → 2341.40] joining our voice with the angels, with all creation, with the shepherds of old,
[2341.90 → 2345.16] singing your worth and majesty.
[2345.16 → 2349.94] Take your word and plant it deep in our hearts.
[2350.06 → 2351.46] In Jesus' name we pray.
[2352.36 → 2352.68] Amen.
[2352.68 → 2352.76] Amen.
[2360.50 → 2365.60] This is how the birth of Jesus, the Messiah, came about.
[2365.60 → 2370.10] His mother, Mary, was pledged to Joseph.
[2371.14 → 2377.10] But before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit.
[2377.10 → 2385.80] Because Joseph, her husband, was faithful to the law and yet did not want to expose her to public disgrace,
[2386.20 → 2389.50] he had in mind to divorce her quietly.
[2389.50 → 2396.38] But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said,
[2396.52 → 2402.48] Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife,
[2402.48 → 2407.32] because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
[2408.02 → 2412.34] She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus
[2412.34 → 2416.64] because he will save his people from all their sins.
[2416.64 → 2422.56] All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet.
[2423.48 → 2428.32] The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Emmanuel,
[2428.96 → 2431.12] which means God with us.
[2432.74 → 2436.70] When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him
[2436.70 → 2439.06] and he took Mary home as his wife.
[2439.60 → 2443.80] But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son
[2443.80 → 2446.72] and he gave him the name Jesus.
[2447.42 → 2448.74] This is the word of the Lord.
[2454.48 → 2459.92] This year for Advent and Christmas, if you're visiting with us this morning
[2459.92 → 2461.68] or checking us out for the first time,
[2462.10 → 2468.52] we have been working towards this idea that we've called hallmark Christmas.
[2468.52 → 2475.88] And by that, we've meant that we have been trying to sort of remove the layers of whitewashing
[2475.88 → 2481.46] or misinformation or cultural fluff that have been added to the story
[2481.46 → 2485.06] for so many generations, for so long,
[2485.14 → 2489.34] that it has become hard to separate fact from fiction.
[2489.34 → 2493.90] And I'll be honest with you,
[2494.66 → 2497.92] doing this past Christmas season,
[2498.04 → 2500.38] these past four weeks or so,
[2500.82 → 2501.36] has
[2501.36 → 2506.24] has helped me love Christmas again.
[2510.26 → 2510.78] Ordinarily,
[2511.14 → 2514.38] I get really frustrated around this time of year
[2514.38 → 2518.60] because of the way that the culture has sort of hijacked Christmas
[2518.60 → 2524.12] and turned it into sleigh bells and Santa Clauses on every porch and corner.
[2524.96 → 2525.92] And I confess,
[2526.18 → 2528.98] it grates on me a little every year
[2528.98 → 2531.12] when the radio stations that I listen to,
[2531.18 → 2532.40] and there's really only two of them,
[2533.02 → 2535.96] start playing Christmas music in mid-November.
[2535.96 → 2540.36] But this year has been different,
[2540.62 → 2542.12] and that's in large part because
[2542.12 → 2545.04] of you and the work we've been doing here
[2545.04 → 2547.36] and the conversations that have been developed.
[2547.68 → 2551.38] And we've leaned into the rhythms of Advent
[2551.38 → 2554.20] and the liturgy of waiting in the darkness
[2554.20 → 2557.20] and waiting for that light to slowly,
[2557.70 → 2560.26] slowly shine through a crack.
[2560.26 → 2563.12] And I've really enjoyed with you
[2563.12 → 2564.60] and with Pastor Kevin
[2564.60 → 2567.80] pulling back the sort of Western cultural veil
[2567.80 → 2570.78] and the hallmarking of Christmas that has happened.
[2572.36 → 2575.24] I like the idea and the practice
[2575.24 → 2579.50] of deconstructing cultural and religious ideologies
[2579.50 → 2580.84] and idolatries.
[2582.34 → 2583.76] And if you know me,
[2584.10 → 2586.40] you know that I believe the church
[2586.40 → 2588.08] is precisely the place
[2588.08 → 2590.46] where these sorts of conversations should be happening.
[2591.94 → 2595.32] And precisely because Christmas did happen,
[2595.44 → 2597.80] that Jesus did come in history,
[2597.96 → 2601.72] precisely because this is the greatest story ever told
[2601.72 → 2604.70] and its greatness is largely owing to the fact
[2604.70 → 2605.80] that it's real,
[2606.10 → 2610.78] we constantly need to re-narrate our lives
[2610.78 → 2612.14] in the truth of the gospel
[2612.14 → 2615.94] and the truth of Jesus' come and his coming again.
[2615.94 → 2619.28] And here's the thing about that
[2619.28 → 2622.40] where I'd like to spend a little time with you this morning.
[2623.72 → 2625.54] Because you see, this time of year
[2625.54 → 2630.08] and our places in the world,
[2631.32 → 2633.44] our responsibilities,
[2634.28 → 2637.22] our idea of meaning, right?
[2637.82 → 2642.34] Meaning comes from these stories.
[2642.34 → 2644.44] That meaning is found,
[2644.66 → 2645.68] it is identified,
[2645.94 → 2646.62] it is made,
[2646.74 → 2647.84] however you want to put it.
[2648.14 → 2651.10] Meaning comes out of the story
[2651.10 → 2653.90] that you are rooting yourself in.
[2656.60 → 2659.26] I listened to a podcast recently
[2659.26 → 2662.20] called The Four Horsemen of Meaning.
[2662.58 → 2663.50] We can talk about it later.
[2663.56 → 2664.52] I don't need to get into the details.
[2664.66 → 2665.62] It's two and a half hours long.
[2666.20 → 2667.00] But in there,
[2667.08 → 2668.90] there was a whole conversation about meaning
[2668.90 → 2670.14] and the source of meaning.
[2670.26 → 2672.32] And the people in this conversation
[2672.32 → 2674.16] was a cognitive scientist
[2674.16 → 2676.08] and a psychoanalyst,
[2676.44 → 2678.02] an art theologian,
[2678.12 → 2679.28] and a Catholic bishop.
[2680.14 → 2682.44] And the whole conversation was about meaning
[2682.44 → 2684.46] and where meaning is found
[2684.46 → 2685.50] or how we find it
[2685.50 → 2686.92] and how we come by it.
[2687.08 → 2687.88] And at one point,
[2687.94 → 2689.94] one of the people in this conversation
[2689.94 → 2692.60] said that meaning comes
[2692.60 → 2695.90] from living in purposive relationship
[2695.90 → 2697.02] to the true,
[2697.34 → 2697.76] the good,
[2697.84 → 2698.60] and the beautiful.
[2700.32 → 2701.58] And as Christians,
[2701.92 → 2702.10] right,
[2702.14 → 2703.60] we know that the ultimate true,
[2703.72 → 2704.32] the ultimate good,
[2704.40 → 2705.20] the ultimate beautiful
[2705.20 → 2706.98] is God.
[2708.80 → 2709.26] Now,
[2709.46 → 2712.58] I would add to that conversation
[2712.58 → 2715.76] that the way that we have
[2715.76 → 2717.78] a purposive relationship
[2717.78 → 2718.78] to the true,
[2718.92 → 2719.28] the good,
[2719.34 → 2720.00] and the beautiful
[2720.00 → 2723.50] is as God reveals himself
[2723.50 → 2725.76] to us in his word.
[2727.26 → 2727.44] Now,
[2727.58 → 2730.34] let me be really clear with you,
[2730.38 → 2730.54] right,
[2730.62 → 2732.14] because all people,
[2732.66 → 2734.16] whether they are Christian
[2734.16 → 2736.90] or whether they call it as such,
[2737.20 → 2739.32] all people have a relationship
[2739.32 → 2740.26] to the true,
[2740.38 → 2740.66] the good,
[2740.70 → 2741.30] and the beautiful
[2741.30 → 2743.66] or an idea of what the ultimate true,
[2743.80 → 2743.98] good,
[2744.06 → 2745.48] and beautiful is.
[2746.36 → 2747.90] And as Reformed Christians,
[2748.10 → 2750.84] as our branch of Christianity
[2750.84 → 2752.96] and the Protestant stream,
[2753.50 → 2754.56] as Reformed Christians,
[2755.00 → 2757.20] we call that general sense
[2757.20 → 2758.12] of relationship
[2758.12 → 2759.02] to the true,
[2759.14 → 2759.30] good,
[2759.36 → 2759.74] and the beautiful,
[2759.80 → 2761.56] we call that general revelation.
[2762.52 → 2762.62] Right,
[2762.70 → 2763.74] God reveals himself
[2763.74 → 2764.56] to the world
[2764.56 → 2765.50] in the order
[2765.50 → 2766.62] and the majesty
[2766.62 → 2767.94] and the magnitude
[2767.94 → 2769.30] of creation.
[2769.66 → 2770.48] God reveals himself
[2770.48 → 2771.08] to the world
[2771.08 → 2772.02] in its beauty.
[2774.08 → 2774.64] But,
[2774.98 → 2776.46] the way that you have
[2776.46 → 2777.74] a purposive,
[2778.10 → 2778.26] right,
[2778.44 → 2780.20] a meaningful relationship
[2780.20 → 2780.90] to God,
[2781.00 → 2781.44] and thus,
[2781.54 → 2782.88] the way that we understand
[2782.88 → 2783.86] ultimate meaning
[2783.86 → 2785.36] is only by
[2785.36 → 2787.40] his special revelation,
[2787.56 → 2788.26] is only by
[2788.26 → 2790.34] his word,
[2790.80 → 2792.24] by his story.
[2793.16 → 2793.38] Now,
[2793.86 → 2794.98] I get that right now
[2794.98 → 2795.66] I'm at the risk
[2795.66 → 2796.74] of losing some of you
[2796.74 → 2798.42] because I'm talking
[2798.42 → 2799.66] philosophy and theology,
[2799.82 → 2800.80] and so let me just wrap that up
[2800.80 → 2801.58] with this point.
[2803.34 → 2803.82] Meaning,
[2805.26 → 2805.90] individual
[2805.90 → 2807.68] and personal,
[2808.60 → 2809.20] meaning,
[2809.46 → 2809.98] societal
[2809.98 → 2811.06] and collective,
[2811.72 → 2812.98] to not put too fine
[2812.98 → 2813.76] a point on it,
[2813.94 → 2814.04] right,
[2814.08 → 2815.06] the very why
[2815.06 → 2815.80] of life
[2815.80 → 2816.76] and purpose
[2816.76 → 2818.56] comes out of
[2818.56 → 2819.32] living in
[2819.32 → 2820.04] purposive
[2820.04 → 2820.92] relationship
[2820.92 → 2821.90] to God
[2821.90 → 2822.78] as the one
[2822.78 → 2823.84] true God
[2823.84 → 2824.52] and the God
[2824.52 → 2825.44] of truth,
[2825.50 → 2826.38] as the only
[2826.38 → 2827.46] ultimate good
[2827.46 → 2828.42] and the overflowing
[2828.42 → 2829.84] source of all good,
[2829.94 → 2830.66] as the most
[2830.66 → 2831.24] magnificent
[2831.24 → 2832.26] and beautiful
[2832.26 → 2832.74] being
[2832.74 → 2833.66] as his glory
[2833.66 → 2835.16] pours forth.
[2836.58 → 2837.52] Any sense
[2837.52 → 2838.14] of meaning
[2838.14 → 2839.84] that you make,
[2839.88 → 2840.76] or for any sense
[2840.76 → 2841.10] of meaning
[2841.10 → 2841.58] that you make
[2841.58 → 2842.76] to have legs,
[2842.98 → 2843.94] it needs to
[2843.94 → 2845.90] walk in the story
[2845.90 → 2847.64] of God's revelation
[2847.64 → 2848.88] to the world.
[2850.16 → 2850.98] I can't
[2850.98 → 2851.90] understate this
[2851.90 → 2852.90] point
[2852.90 → 2853.86] at all
[2853.86 → 2854.78] here now
[2854.78 → 2855.50] at Christmas.
[2856.66 → 2858.08] Who you are
[2858.08 → 2859.42] is filled
[2859.42 → 2860.52] up with meaning
[2860.52 → 2861.88] and with purpose
[2861.88 → 2862.98] as you are
[2862.98 → 2863.64] found
[2863.64 → 2865.04] in the story
[2865.04 → 2866.10] of God.
[2867.74 → 2868.12] And so,
[2868.24 → 2868.76] by all means,
[2869.12 → 2869.86] deconstruct
[2869.86 → 2870.52] your faith,
[2871.70 → 2872.16] but do it
[2872.16 → 2872.98] in the context
[2872.98 → 2874.00] of the community
[2874.00 → 2874.58] of faith,
[2875.38 → 2875.52] right,
[2875.56 → 2876.68] make it your own,
[2877.60 → 2878.80] ask hard questions,
[2879.32 → 2879.98] expose
[2879.98 → 2881.56] the competing
[2881.56 → 2882.32] stories
[2882.32 → 2883.56] of the culture
[2883.56 → 2884.32] to the truth
[2884.32 → 2884.92] of the gospel,
[2885.20 → 2885.38] right,
[2885.54 → 2886.30] hallmark
[2886.30 → 2887.24] your Christmases
[2887.24 → 2887.94] because the very
[2887.94 → 2889.24] meaning of your life
[2889.24 → 2891.06] comes out of the story
[2891.06 → 2891.88] that you are
[2891.88 → 2892.94] rooting yourself in.
[2895.44 → 2896.96] And it's been my prayer
[2896.96 → 2897.70] throughout this
[2897.70 → 2899.06] Christmas season
[2899.06 → 2900.34] that we,
[2900.56 → 2900.92] together,
[2901.08 → 2901.98] would be rooted
[2901.98 → 2903.60] in the true
[2903.60 → 2905.00] story of
[2905.00 → 2905.84] Jesus.
[2906.40 → 2907.06] The real
[2907.06 → 2907.82] Jesus.
[2908.08 → 2909.16] The Jesus of
[2909.16 → 2909.70] the Bible
[2909.70 → 2910.54] and of history
[2910.54 → 2911.16] because you see
[2911.16 → 2912.34] the historical
[2912.34 → 2913.46] Jesus is
[2913.46 → 2914.64] the biblical
[2914.64 → 2915.80] Jesus.
[2917.24 → 2918.88] try as we
[2918.88 → 2919.24] might
[2919.24 → 2919.56] to
[2919.56 → 2920.98] disenchant
[2920.98 → 2921.52] our sense
[2921.52 → 2922.06] of self
[2922.06 → 2922.68] in the modern
[2922.68 → 2923.04] world.
[2923.20 → 2924.32] Try as the
[2924.32 → 2925.46] pagan impulse
[2925.46 → 2925.90] might
[2925.90 → 2926.96] to limit
[2926.96 → 2928.00] what is
[2928.00 → 2928.76] here
[2928.76 → 2929.44] to the
[2929.44 → 2929.86] imminent
[2929.86 → 2930.46] frame.
[2930.82 → 2931.70] Try as we
[2931.70 → 2931.94] might
[2931.94 → 2932.56] to block
[2932.56 → 2933.12] out the
[2933.12 → 2933.88] transcendent
[2933.88 → 2934.48] from breaking
[2934.48 → 2934.92] in
[2934.92 → 2936.66] and haunting
[2936.66 → 2937.86] our reality
[2937.86 → 2938.62] with a longing
[2938.62 → 2939.12] for something
[2939.12 → 2939.38] more.
[2939.84 → 2941.18] Christmastime
[2941.18 → 2942.40] reminds us
[2942.40 → 2943.16] of that
[2943.16 → 2943.56] something
[2943.56 → 2944.06] more.
[2944.06 → 2945.40] There's a
[2945.40 → 2946.04] reason that
[2946.04 → 2946.94] even the
[2946.94 → 2947.72] strictest
[2947.72 → 2948.58] secularist
[2948.58 → 2949.38] feels something
[2949.38 → 2950.76] magical about
[2950.76 → 2951.54] Christmas.
[2952.62 → 2953.04] There's a
[2953.04 → 2953.56] reason why
[2953.56 → 2954.32] even the
[2954.32 → 2954.62] biggest
[2954.62 → 2955.04] Drink
[2955.04 → 2955.48] can have
[2955.48 → 2956.00] his heart
[2956.00 → 2956.84] grown three
[2956.84 → 2957.32] sizes
[2957.32 → 2958.18] this time
[2958.18 → 2958.48] of year.
[2959.88 → 2960.20] No matter
[2960.20 → 2961.20] how vehemently
[2961.20 → 2961.88] the captives
[2961.88 → 2962.52] and captains
[2962.52 → 2963.14] of imminence
[2963.14 → 2963.62] might say
[2963.62 → 2964.20] otherwise,
[2964.46 → 2965.14] the story
[2965.14 → 2965.78] of God
[2965.78 → 2966.58] in you
[2966.58 → 2967.60] longs for
[2967.60 → 2968.04] more,
[2968.36 → 2968.98] especially
[2968.98 → 2969.98] at times
[2969.98 → 2970.52] like this.
[2970.52 → 2972.40] In this
[2972.40 → 2973.76] increasingly
[2973.76 → 2974.62] disenchanted
[2974.62 → 2975.08] world,
[2975.48 → 2975.82] what we
[2975.82 → 2976.56] need is
[2976.56 → 2977.54] what C.S.
[2977.62 → 2978.88] Lewis might
[2978.88 → 2979.46] have called
[2979.46 → 2980.34] an experience
[2980.34 → 2980.72] of the
[2980.72 → 2981.10] deeper
[2981.10 → 2981.94] magic.
[2983.02 → 2984.10] We need
[2984.10 → 2984.74] a taste
[2984.74 → 2985.98] of eternity
[2985.98 → 2987.56] because,
[2987.88 → 2988.14] as the
[2988.14 → 2988.58] teacher
[2988.58 → 2989.60] writing in
[2989.60 → 2990.28] Ecclesiastes
[2990.28 → 2990.82] says,
[2991.20 → 2991.94] God has
[2991.94 → 2992.88] set eternity
[2992.88 → 2993.86] in every
[2993.86 → 2994.70] human
[2994.70 → 2995.50] heart.
[2996.26 → 2996.86] And that,
[2997.30 → 2997.88] my friends,
[2998.10 → 2998.58] is what
[2998.58 → 2999.28] Christmas
[2999.28 → 3000.44] gives us
[3000.44 → 3001.16] a glimpse
[3001.16 → 3002.20] into.
[3003.56 → 3004.20] Eternity
[3004.20 → 3004.90] entered
[3004.90 → 3005.50] into
[3005.50 → 3006.46] time.
[3010.72 → 3011.58] This is
[3011.58 → 3012.00] how the
[3012.00 → 3012.42] birth of
[3012.42 → 3012.72] Jesus,
[3012.98 → 3013.46] the Messiah,
[3013.74 → 3014.24] came about.
[3015.22 → 3015.66] Mary was
[3015.66 → 3016.18] found to
[3016.18 → 3016.66] be pregnant
[3016.66 → 3017.54] through the
[3017.54 → 3018.32] Holy Spirit.
[3019.58 → 3020.36] The angel
[3020.36 → 3020.78] of the Lord
[3020.78 → 3021.58] appeared to
[3021.58 → 3022.36] Joseph and
[3022.36 → 3022.66] said,
[3022.80 → 3023.14] what is
[3023.14 → 3023.72] conceived
[3023.72 → 3024.36] in her
[3024.36 → 3025.20] is from
[3025.20 → 3025.86] the Holy
[3025.86 → 3026.86] Spirit.
[3027.28 → 3027.82] All this
[3027.82 → 3028.56] took place
[3028.56 → 3029.18] to fulfill
[3029.18 → 3029.54] what the
[3029.54 → 3029.96] Lord had
[3029.96 → 3030.48] said through
[3030.48 → 3030.98] the prophet.
[3031.34 → 3031.76] The virgin
[3031.76 → 3032.44] will conceive
[3032.44 → 3032.98] and give
[3032.98 → 3033.42] birth to
[3033.42 → 3033.86] a son,
[3034.28 → 3034.62] and they
[3034.62 → 3035.20] will call
[3035.20 → 3035.62] him
[3035.62 → 3037.18] Emmanuel,
[3038.26 → 3039.14] which means
[3039.14 → 3040.20] God
[3040.20 → 3041.62] with us.
[3042.32 → 3042.64] The
[3042.64 → 3043.78] transcendent
[3043.78 → 3044.74] has become
[3044.74 → 3045.44] imminent.
[3045.70 → 3045.98] God
[3045.98 → 3046.98] with us.
[3047.08 → 3047.60] Emmanuel,
[3047.84 → 3048.34] the infinite
[3048.34 → 3049.20] has become
[3049.20 → 3049.92] finite.
[3050.26 → 3050.64] God
[3050.64 → 3051.16] became
[3051.16 → 3051.82] man.
[3051.96 → 3052.24] Let that
[3052.24 → 3053.00] echo in your
[3053.00 → 3053.98] hearts for a
[3053.98 → 3054.18] moment.
[3054.34 → 3054.64] God
[3054.64 → 3055.08] became
[3055.08 → 3055.66] man.
[3055.76 → 3055.98] Let that
[3055.98 → 3056.86] reverberate in
[3056.86 → 3058.02] your imaginations
[3058.02 → 3058.68] because the
[3058.68 → 3059.70] true story of
[3059.70 → 3061.04] Christmas is
[3061.04 → 3062.22] the incarnation,
[3062.64 → 3062.90] right, where
[3062.90 → 3063.88] God took on
[3063.88 → 3064.60] flesh to
[3064.60 → 3065.82] ransom us.
[3065.92 → 3066.62] The true story
[3066.62 → 3067.18] of Christmas
[3067.18 → 3067.88] is the
[3067.88 → 3068.94] incarnation where
[3068.94 → 3069.84] she will give
[3069.84 → 3070.54] birth to a
[3070.54 → 3071.34] son and you
[3071.34 → 3071.88] are to give
[3071.88 → 3072.38] him the name
[3072.38 → 3073.34] Jesus because
[3073.34 → 3074.54] he will save
[3074.54 → 3075.22] his people
[3075.22 → 3076.22] from their
[3076.22 → 3076.62] sins.
[3077.08 → 3077.50] Christmas
[3077.50 → 3079.08] happens so
[3079.08 → 3079.74] that God
[3079.74 → 3080.54] can conquer
[3080.54 → 3081.52] sin on the
[3081.52 → 3082.20] cross by
[3082.20 → 3083.00] giving us
[3083.00 → 3083.82] an empty
[3083.82 → 3084.30] tomb,
[3084.30 → 3085.22] and anything
[3085.22 → 3086.02] less just
[3086.02 → 3086.40] isn't
[3086.40 → 3086.90] Christmas.
[3087.40 → 3087.66] Anything
[3087.66 → 3088.54] less isn't
[3088.54 → 3089.36] enough to
[3089.36 → 3089.94] give you
[3089.94 → 3091.64] meaning in
[3091.64 → 3092.40] this life.
[3093.88 → 3094.48] Meaning
[3094.48 → 3095.40] comes out of
[3095.40 → 3096.54] the story you
[3096.54 → 3097.28] are rooting
[3097.28 → 3098.22] yourself in
[3098.22 → 3098.92] and for that
[3098.92 → 3099.58] meaning to
[3099.58 → 3100.34] last, for that
[3100.34 → 3100.92] meaning to be
[3100.92 → 3101.68] ultimate, really,
[3101.94 → 3102.42] for that meaning
[3102.42 → 3103.04] to be worth
[3103.04 → 3104.04] anything at
[3104.04 → 3105.32] all, the
[3105.32 → 3106.20] story that
[3106.20 → 3106.86] it's based
[3106.86 → 3107.88] on needs to
[3107.88 → 3109.02] be rooted
[3109.02 → 3110.56] in history
[3110.56 → 3111.64] and this
[3111.64 → 3113.98] story, for
[3113.98 → 3114.38] all of its
[3114.38 → 3115.92] paradoxes and
[3115.92 → 3117.16] mysteries, has
[3117.16 → 3117.98] all the
[3117.98 → 3119.36] hallmarks of
[3119.36 → 3120.98] being true,
[3121.60 → 3123.04] of actually
[3123.04 → 3124.16] having
[3124.16 → 3125.22] happened.
[3127.14 → 3127.98] Matthew and
[3127.98 → 3129.30] Luke tie
[3129.30 → 3130.04] us to
[3130.04 → 3131.38] history in
[3131.38 → 3131.94] their gospel
[3131.94 → 3132.62] accounts of
[3132.62 → 3133.38] Jesus' birth by
[3133.38 → 3133.78] giving us
[3133.78 → 3134.72] genealogies,
[3135.08 → 3135.88] which is you
[3135.88 → 3136.40] were making
[3136.40 → 3137.04] up these
[3137.04 → 3137.98] stories, there
[3137.98 → 3138.56] are certainly
[3138.56 → 3139.32] unseemly
[3139.32 → 3140.46] characters that
[3140.46 → 3140.76] you would
[3140.76 → 3142.12] omit, unless
[3142.12 → 3143.38] the truth
[3143.38 → 3144.14] of it matters
[3144.14 → 3144.70] to you.
[3145.50 → 3146.22] Because if the
[3146.22 → 3146.62] truth of it
[3146.62 → 3147.06] matters to
[3147.06 → 3147.44] you, then
[3147.44 → 3148.32] their inclusion
[3148.32 → 3149.32] becomes an
[3149.32 → 3149.92] argument for
[3149.92 → 3150.48] the story's
[3150.48 → 3150.80] truth.
[3152.10 → 3152.68] The same can
[3152.68 → 3153.32] be said about
[3153.32 → 3154.14] the first
[3154.14 → 3155.46] witnesses being
[3155.46 → 3156.38] shepherds at
[3156.38 → 3156.96] the birth of
[3156.96 → 3157.50] Jesus and
[3157.50 → 3158.16] women at the
[3158.16 → 3158.58] resurrection.
[3158.88 → 3159.42] If you were
[3159.42 → 3160.02] making this
[3160.02 → 3160.98] up, you
[3160.98 → 3161.50] wouldn't have
[3161.50 → 3162.12] used people
[3162.12 → 3162.82] whose testimony
[3162.82 → 3163.64] was legally
[3163.64 → 3164.72] inadmissible and
[3164.72 → 3165.40] so easily
[3165.40 → 3165.98] dismissed.
[3165.98 → 3167.90] Or likewise
[3167.90 → 3168.58] with the
[3168.58 → 3169.24] so-called
[3169.24 → 3169.96] wise men,
[3170.08 → 3170.72] the pagan
[3170.72 → 3171.56] wizards,
[3171.66 → 3171.78] right?
[3171.82 → 3172.24] If you were
[3172.24 → 3172.78] trying to
[3172.78 → 3173.54] fabricate a
[3173.54 → 3174.28] story of a
[3174.28 → 3175.48] Jewish Messiah,
[3175.66 → 3176.08] you wouldn't
[3176.08 → 3177.04] have pagans
[3177.04 → 3177.76] come from
[3177.76 → 3178.42] Arabia to
[3178.42 → 3178.90] praise him
[3178.90 → 3179.28] while the
[3179.28 → 3180.10] Jewish king
[3180.10 → 3180.60] tries to
[3180.60 → 3181.34] kill him,
[3182.36 → 3183.06] taking on the
[3183.06 → 3183.46] role of
[3183.46 → 3184.04] Pharaoh in
[3184.04 → 3184.62] that story.
[3185.04 → 3185.92] Unless, in
[3185.92 → 3186.50] all three of
[3186.50 → 3187.14] these cases,
[3187.48 → 3187.88] the truth
[3187.88 → 3188.72] matters to
[3188.72 → 3189.46] you, and
[3189.46 → 3190.46] then those
[3190.46 → 3191.40] things being
[3191.40 → 3192.18] recorded as
[3192.18 → 3192.62] such become
[3192.62 → 3193.40] an argument for
[3193.40 → 3194.12] the truth of
[3194.12 → 3194.78] the story.
[3195.98 → 3196.48] Right?
[3196.56 → 3197.22] All throughout
[3197.22 → 3197.96] this Advent
[3197.96 → 3198.84] and Christmas
[3198.84 → 3199.58] season, we
[3199.58 → 3200.06] have been
[3200.06 → 3200.82] going back
[3200.82 → 3201.14] to the
[3201.14 → 3201.44] true,
[3201.76 → 3202.34] historical,
[3202.84 → 3203.62] deep magic
[3203.62 → 3204.70] story of
[3204.70 → 3205.34] God at
[3205.34 → 3206.20] work in
[3206.20 → 3206.66] the world.
[3207.76 → 3208.44] And yes,
[3209.30 → 3209.92] some of our
[3209.92 → 3211.40] expectations and
[3211.40 → 3212.18] our hallmarked
[3212.18 → 3212.72] versions of
[3212.72 → 3213.32] the story have
[3213.32 → 3213.92] been challenged,
[3214.04 → 3214.38] they've been
[3214.38 → 3215.30] deconstructed,
[3215.34 → 3215.94] but the goal,
[3216.10 → 3216.84] the hope,
[3217.02 → 3218.02] has always been
[3218.02 → 3219.04] to bring you
[3219.04 → 3220.48] closer to
[3220.48 → 3221.04] the true
[3221.04 → 3222.00] Jesus, to
[3222.00 → 3222.94] the real
[3222.94 → 3223.98] Jesus.
[3223.98 → 3225.76] Jesus, the
[3225.76 → 3226.22] historical
[3226.22 → 3227.78] Jesus, revealed
[3227.78 → 3229.06] in the
[3229.06 → 3229.32] Word of
[3229.32 → 3229.62] God.
[3230.74 → 3231.40] Because the
[3231.40 → 3232.94] truth is, and
[3232.94 → 3233.60] you know this,
[3233.82 → 3234.78] right, 2,000
[3234.78 → 3236.04] years later, over
[3236.04 → 3237.18] 10,000 kilometres
[3237.18 → 3237.90] away, in a
[3237.90 → 3238.50] whole different
[3238.50 → 3239.66] culture, right,
[3239.70 → 3239.98] in a different
[3239.98 → 3240.94] time and space
[3240.94 → 3242.10] and place, it
[3242.10 → 3243.74] is so, so
[3243.74 → 3244.84] easy to
[3244.84 → 3245.80] substitute a
[3245.80 → 3246.82] Jesus of our
[3246.82 → 3247.72] own making
[3247.72 → 3249.02] for the one
[3249.02 → 3249.46] of the Bible.
[3249.46 → 3252.42] So a really
[3252.42 → 3253.24] great illustration
[3253.24 → 3255.38] of this in
[3255.38 → 3255.84] the book
[3255.84 → 3257.04] American Gods
[3257.04 → 3257.84] by Neil
[3257.84 → 3258.16] Caiman.
[3258.78 → 3259.80] It's a fictional
[3259.80 → 3260.78] story of a
[3260.78 → 3261.48] whole pantheon
[3261.48 → 3262.12] of gods who
[3262.12 → 3263.04] are in the
[3263.04 → 3263.76] midst fighting
[3263.76 → 3264.32] among
[3264.32 → 3265.82] themselves and
[3265.82 → 3266.52] us for
[3266.52 → 3267.62] attention as
[3267.62 → 3268.28] the means by
[3268.28 → 3268.90] which their
[3268.90 → 3269.66] presence in
[3269.66 → 3270.22] the world is
[3270.22 → 3270.66] sustained.
[3271.10 → 3271.80] This is an
[3271.80 → 3272.18] illustration.
[3272.98 → 3273.88] The TV
[3273.88 → 3275.00] adaptation of
[3275.00 → 3276.52] this novel
[3276.52 → 3277.18] actually goes
[3277.18 → 3277.88] even further to
[3277.88 → 3278.34] the point that
[3278.34 → 3278.82] we're about to
[3278.82 → 3279.00] make.
[3279.46 → 3280.54] In the TV
[3280.54 → 3281.12] version of the
[3281.12 → 3282.20] story, Mr.
[3282.32 → 3284.24] Wednesday, who
[3284.24 → 3285.58] is the American
[3285.58 → 3286.42] version of the
[3286.42 → 3287.60] Norse god Odin,
[3288.12 → 3288.92] Wednesday is
[3288.92 → 3290.76] Odin's day, and
[3290.76 → 3292.18] Mr. Ibis, who
[3292.18 → 3293.14] is the American
[3293.14 → 3293.86] version of the
[3293.86 → 3294.64] Egyptian god
[3294.64 → 3295.56] Thoth, who
[3295.56 → 3296.48] usually appears
[3296.48 → 3297.16] as an Ibis
[3297.16 → 3298.96] bird, they
[3298.96 → 3300.92] both say that
[3300.92 → 3302.38] you not only
[3302.38 → 3303.42] have one Jesus
[3303.42 → 3305.24] in our Western
[3305.24 → 3305.94] culture, but you
[3305.94 → 3306.56] have a bunch of
[3306.56 → 3307.86] different Jesus.
[3308.34 → 3308.74] Mr.
[3308.74 → 3309.94] Wednesday explains
[3309.94 → 3310.56] to Shadow
[3310.56 → 3311.22] Moon, who's the
[3311.22 → 3312.26] protagonist, he
[3312.26 → 3312.68] says you've got
[3312.68 → 3313.44] your white Jesus
[3313.44 → 3314.00] and your
[3314.00 → 3314.74] Jesuit style
[3314.74 → 3315.38] Jesus, your
[3315.38 → 3316.06] black African
[3316.06 → 3316.80] Jesus and your
[3316.80 → 3317.68] Mexican Jesus
[3317.68 → 3318.32] and your
[3318.32 → 3319.12] swarthy Greek
[3319.12 → 3319.66] Jesus.
[3321.20 → 3322.20] And truthfully,
[3322.64 → 3323.70] if you look
[3323.70 → 3324.34] around, it goes
[3324.34 → 3325.22] even further than
[3325.22 → 3325.56] that.
[3326.42 → 3327.52] Because in the
[3327.52 → 3328.60] evangelical culture,
[3328.74 → 3329.28] more generally,
[3329.54 → 3330.14] you've got your
[3330.14 → 3331.28] hypermasculine
[3331.28 → 3331.82] Jesus.
[3333.04 → 3333.50] But then to
[3333.50 → 3334.26] contrast that out,
[3334.32 → 3334.76] you've got your
[3334.76 → 3335.60] feminine Jesus,
[3336.60 → 3337.24] you've got your
[3337.24 → 3338.16] hipster Jesus,
[3338.44 → 3339.54] and you've got
[3339.54 → 3339.98] your hippie
[3339.98 → 3340.42] Jesus.
[3341.42 → 3342.60] It all depends
[3342.60 → 3343.60] on what you
[3343.60 → 3344.44] think you need
[3344.44 → 3344.96] him for.
[3345.60 → 3346.38] Or it all
[3346.38 → 3347.16] depends on which
[3347.16 → 3348.64] version of him
[3348.64 → 3350.50] you like best
[3350.50 → 3351.40] or find the
[3351.40 → 3352.48] most palatable.
[3354.56 → 3355.48] Another example
[3355.48 → 3356.02] of this, and I
[3356.02 → 3356.58] hesitate to tell
[3356.58 → 3356.90] you that I've
[3356.90 → 3357.44] seen this movie,
[3357.54 → 3358.34] but in the movie
[3358.34 → 3359.30] Talladega Nights,
[3360.48 → 3361.12] Ricky Bobby
[3361.12 → 3362.92] prays to baby
[3362.92 → 3364.50] Jesus because he
[3364.50 → 3365.14] likes the baby
[3365.14 → 3365.76] Jesus better
[3365.76 → 3366.78] because the baby
[3366.78 → 3367.28] Jesus is going
[3367.28 → 3367.68] to get him all
[3367.68 → 3368.04] that money.
[3370.62 → 3371.82] The reality is
[3371.82 → 3372.68] some of you
[3372.68 → 3374.02] prefer a Jesus
[3374.02 → 3375.30] safely on the
[3375.30 → 3375.82] pages of the
[3375.82 → 3376.40] Bible and in
[3376.40 → 3377.38] history, but not
[3377.38 → 3378.26] active in the
[3378.26 → 3378.90] world by the
[3378.90 → 3379.56] Holy Spirit.
[3380.04 → 3380.72] Some of us
[3380.72 → 3381.90] prefer Jesus
[3381.90 → 3382.58] who is a good
[3382.58 → 3383.70] teacher, but we
[3383.70 → 3384.24] don't think we
[3384.24 → 3384.96] need any more
[3384.96 → 3386.14] from him or of
[3386.14 → 3386.76] him than that.
[3387.18 → 3388.10] Sometimes we like
[3388.10 → 3388.96] the idea of
[3388.96 → 3389.86] Jesus as a
[3389.86 → 3391.28] Saviour, but not
[3391.28 → 3392.28] as the Lord
[3392.28 → 3394.12] of our lives.
[3396.40 → 3396.94] I'm going to
[3396.94 → 3397.88] let you, like
[3397.88 → 3398.70] Mary, ponder
[3398.70 → 3399.56] these things in
[3399.56 → 3401.08] your heart, figure
[3401.08 → 3401.80] out which one is
[3401.80 → 3401.98] you.
[3403.46 → 3404.30] I can tell you
[3404.30 → 3405.98] for myself, for
[3405.98 → 3406.80] the longest time,
[3407.16 → 3408.20] I preferred the
[3408.20 → 3409.12] Jesus of my
[3409.12 → 3410.22] doctrines and my
[3410.22 → 3411.42] theological systems
[3411.42 → 3413.14] because ideas I
[3413.14 → 3413.94] can grasp.
[3415.04 → 3416.18] Ideas and systems
[3416.18 → 3417.14] I can box up
[3417.14 → 3418.22] nice and tidy,
[3418.72 → 3420.06] and by being able
[3420.06 → 3420.74] to box those
[3420.74 → 3421.54] things up nice and
[3421.54 → 3422.36] tidy, I can
[3422.36 → 3423.26] exercise some
[3423.26 → 3425.88] control in my
[3425.88 → 3426.56] relationship to
[3426.56 → 3426.82] God.
[3427.84 → 3429.12] The reality of
[3429.12 → 3430.38] Jesus active in
[3430.38 → 3431.26] the world and in
[3431.26 → 3432.54] my heart, demanding
[3432.54 → 3434.24] my devotion and
[3434.24 → 3435.22] every square inch
[3435.22 → 3436.20] of my life was,
[3436.48 → 3436.84] well, that was
[3436.84 → 3437.90] harder to accept
[3437.90 → 3438.88] and to come to
[3438.88 → 3439.84] love and to
[3439.84 → 3440.60] realize that I
[3440.60 → 3440.90] need.
[3442.78 → 3443.86] But if you are
[3443.86 → 3444.60] hungry for
[3444.60 → 3447.24] meaning, if this
[3447.24 → 3448.36] Christmas you are
[3448.36 → 3449.42] looking for a
[3449.42 → 3450.92] purpose that lasts,
[3450.92 → 3452.90] the truth is, you
[3452.90 → 3453.74] are looking for
[3453.74 → 3455.14] the real Jesus.
[3457.22 → 3459.22] And so we all
[3459.22 → 3460.22] together need to
[3460.22 → 3461.32] stop accepting
[3461.32 → 3462.82] substitutes or
[3462.82 → 3464.14] fabrications or
[3464.14 → 3465.88] lesser glories.
[3466.70 → 3467.94] Come to the one
[3467.94 → 3468.86] true God who
[3468.86 → 3470.54] reveals himself in
[3470.54 → 3471.54] his word because
[3471.54 → 3472.84] he is the source
[3472.84 → 3474.40] of your meaning.
[3474.64 → 3475.46] Relationship to
[3475.46 → 3476.68] him is the source
[3476.68 → 3477.84] of your why.
[3481.58 → 3483.74] Look, it's
[3483.74 → 3484.14] Jesus.
[3484.68 → 3485.44] It is this
[3485.44 → 3487.62] Jesus revealed in
[3487.62 → 3489.08] the Bible come in
[3489.08 → 3489.54] history.
[3489.90 → 3490.88] This Jesus who
[3490.88 → 3492.78] was born a babe in
[3492.78 → 3493.80] Bethlehem and
[3493.80 → 3494.76] placed in a manger.
[3495.16 → 3495.94] Jesus whom
[3495.94 → 3497.42] shepherds praised
[3497.42 → 3498.14] and pagans
[3498.14 → 3499.02] magnified.
[3499.38 → 3500.42] Jesus whose birth
[3500.42 → 3501.50] was simultaneously
[3501.50 → 3503.08] incredible for its
[3503.08 → 3504.18] ordinariness but
[3504.18 → 3505.22] anything but
[3505.22 → 3506.10] ordinary.
[3506.50 → 3507.14] Jesus who
[3507.14 → 3508.22] lived the life I
[3508.22 → 3509.20] should have lived
[3509.20 → 3509.94] and Jesus who
[3509.94 → 3510.84] died the death
[3510.84 → 3511.70] that I deserved
[3511.70 → 3512.42] and was raised
[3512.42 → 3513.28] three days later
[3513.28 → 3514.46] victorious over
[3514.46 → 3515.14] sin and death.
[3515.28 → 3516.16] Jesus who came
[3516.16 → 3517.26] once as a babe
[3517.26 → 3518.02] and will come
[3518.02 → 3519.24] again as king
[3519.24 → 3520.18] of the universe.
[3520.58 → 3522.04] This Jesus is
[3522.04 → 3523.14] calling to you
[3523.14 → 3524.64] now, and he's
[3524.64 → 3525.92] saying find your
[3525.92 → 3527.92] meaning with me.
[3528.82 → 3530.04] The truth of his
[3530.04 → 3531.24] coming and the
[3531.24 → 3532.10] hopeful truth of
[3532.10 → 3533.26] his coming again
[3533.26 → 3534.66] is the story by
[3534.66 → 3535.46] which you can
[3535.46 → 3537.00] narrate your life
[3537.00 → 3538.52] in which you can
[3538.52 → 3539.98] find meaning.
[3541.34 → 3542.28] And look, I
[3542.28 → 3545.08] know that you
[3545.08 → 3545.70] are wondering
[3545.70 → 3548.18] and I know that
[3548.18 → 3549.22] you are wandering
[3549.22 → 3551.34] and I know that
[3551.34 → 3552.88] especially right now
[3552.88 → 3553.34] with all the
[3553.34 → 3555.14] chaoses of life
[3555.14 → 3555.98] and the confusion
[3555.98 → 3557.06] and the anxiety,
[3557.32 → 3558.44] I know that you
[3558.44 → 3559.36] are looking for
[3559.36 → 3560.56] meaning and for
[3560.56 → 3561.56] purpose that will
[3561.56 → 3563.40] last and here
[3563.40 → 3565.18] now this Christmas
[3565.18 → 3567.70] this is Jesus,
[3568.00 → 3569.46] the real Jesus
[3569.46 → 3570.48] and yes,
[3570.62 → 3571.74] while he commands
[3571.74 → 3573.04] everything from you,
[3573.34 → 3574.58] he loves you
[3574.58 → 3576.00] and yes,
[3576.10 → 3577.26] his word might
[3577.26 → 3578.82] sometimes be hard
[3578.82 → 3580.64] but it is always,
[3580.88 → 3582.40] always true
[3582.40 → 3583.82] and yes,
[3583.92 → 3585.26] sometimes life in him
[3585.26 → 3586.44] isn't necessarily
[3586.44 → 3588.00] safe, but it is
[3588.00 → 3589.68] always good.
[3589.68 → 3592.10] and yes,
[3592.30 → 3594.32] this Christmas,
[3594.84 → 3595.48] the incarnation
[3595.48 → 3596.64] might seem
[3596.64 → 3597.70] impossible
[3597.70 → 3599.98] but oh my
[3599.98 → 3601.06] God with
[3601.06 → 3601.90] us,
[3602.38 → 3602.66] it
[3602.66 → 3604.18] is
[3604.18 → 3605.56] beautiful.
[3606.64 → 3607.02] Amen?
[3608.02 → 3608.68] Amen.
[3609.02 → 3609.42] Let's pray.
[3609.42 → 3609.50] Amen.
[3609.50 → 3615.56] Lord Jesus Christ,
[3615.96 → 3617.12] we make much
[3617.12 → 3617.80] of you
[3617.80 → 3619.08] in our worship
[3619.08 → 3619.92] today
[3619.92 → 3620.64] and so make
[3620.64 → 3621.54] much of yourself
[3621.54 → 3623.00] in our hearts.
[3624.00 → 3624.70] May we find
[3624.70 → 3625.24] our meaning
[3625.24 → 3626.66] and our purpose
[3626.66 → 3628.32] in relationship
[3628.32 → 3629.40] to you
[3629.40 → 3631.82] as you reveal
[3631.82 → 3632.44] truth,
[3632.56 → 3633.20] as you are
[3633.20 → 3634.32] the source
[3634.32 → 3635.60] of all good
[3635.60 → 3636.34] and as you
[3636.34 → 3637.54] are most
[3637.54 → 3638.56] beautiful,
[3638.78 → 3639.52] captivate
[3639.52 → 3641.20] our imaginations
[3641.20 → 3642.90] that we might
[3642.90 → 3643.76] find ourselves
[3643.76 → 3645.28] in your
[3645.28 → 3646.52] story.
[3648.14 → 3649.10] That we might
[3649.10 → 3650.08] know our lives
[3650.08 → 3651.08] by the life,
[3651.26 → 3651.46] death,
[3651.64 → 3652.04] resurrection
[3652.04 → 3652.98] and exaltation
[3652.98 → 3654.06] of Jesus.
[3655.44 → 3656.66] That we might
[3656.66 → 3657.42] know your
[3657.42 → 3658.24] heart
[3658.24 → 3659.30] for this world
[3659.30 → 3662.16] that caused
[3662.16 → 3662.54] you,
[3662.74 → 3663.48] eternal God,
[3663.58 → 3664.22] to enter
[3664.22 → 3665.96] into time.

[3667.42 → 3667.82] God,
[3668.02 → 3669.88] with us.
[3671.44 → 3672.40] And so now,
[3672.54 → 3673.04] Lord God,
[3673.16 → 3673.92] this Christmas
[3673.92 → 3674.40] day,
[3674.88 → 3676.08] go with us
[3676.08 → 3677.32] that we might
[3677.32 → 3678.92] go with you.
[3680.76 → 3681.76] Christ Jesus,
[3681.90 → 3682.32] we pray.
[3682.32 → 3683.82] Amen.
[3694.22 → 3714.08] things
[3716.20 → 3721.10] and majesty,
[3721.10 → 3724.98] Manhood and deity
[3724.98 → 3728.72] In perfect harmony
[3728.72 → 3733.18] The man who is God
[3733.18 → 3736.34] Lord of eternity
[3736.34 → 3740.26] Dwells in humanity
[3740.26 → 3743.98] Kneels in humility
[3743.98 → 3747.98] And washes our feet
[3747.98 → 3751.84] Oh, what a mystery
[3751.84 → 3755.66] Weakness and majesty
[3755.66 → 3761.46] Bow down and worship
[3761.46 → 3769.48] For this is your God
[3769.48 → 3777.96] Father's pure mania
[3777.96 → 3781.64] Perfect in innocence
[3781.64 → 3784.64] Yet learns obedience
[3784.64 → 3789.70] To death on a cross
[3789.70 → 3793.52] Suffering to give us life
[3793.52 → 3796.64] Lingering through sacrifice
[3796.64 → 3799.64] And as they crucify
[3799.64 → 3803.64] Praise Father, forgive
[3803.64 → 3807.32] Oh, what a mystery
[3807.32 → 3812.00] Meekness and majesty
[3812.00 → 3817.68] Bow down and worship
[3817.68 → 3825.74] For this is your God
[3825.74 → 3834.42] Wisdom unsearchable
[3834.42 → 3837.42] God the invisible
[3837.42 → 3841.42] Love indestructible
[3841.42 → 3845.42] In frailty of years
[3845.42 → 3849.10] Lord of infinity
[3849.10 → 3850.10] Lord of infinity
[3850.10 → 3854.10] Stormings all tenderly
[3854.10 → 3857.10] Lift our humanity
[3857.10 → 3861.10] To the heights of His throne
[3861.10 → 3864.78] Oh, what a mystery
[3864.78 → 3864.84] Oh, what a mystery
[3864.84 → 3868.78] Meekness and majesty
[3868.78 → 3874.46] Thou doubt and worship
[3874.46 → 3882.46] For this is your God
[3882.46 → 3886.14] Lord of infinity
[3886.14 → 3899.14] As you go into today
[3899.14 → 3902.00] Whatever that is going to look like
[3902.00 → 3902.82] For you
[3902.82 → 3904.94] Go first with an invitation
[3904.94 → 3907.78] Know that we gather tomorrow
[3907.78 → 3909.26] On Sunday for worship
[3909.26 → 3911.40] At our regularly scheduled time
[3911.40 → 3912.50] Of 10 a.m.
[3913.18 → 3914.26] And we will continue
[3914.26 → 3918.32] The story of Jesus' life together
[3918.32 → 3920.82] And second as you go
[3920.82 → 3923.58] Go with God's blessing
[3923.58 → 3924.82] I invite you to receive
[3924.82 → 3925.46] God's blessing
[3925.46 → 3928.02] For the day and days ahead
[3928.02 → 3931.64] May God go before you
[3931.64 → 3932.96] To lead you
[3932.96 → 3935.34] May God go behind you
[3935.34 → 3936.62] To guard you
[3936.62 → 3938.78] May God go beneath you
[3938.78 → 3939.86] To support you
[3939.86 → 3941.94] May God go beside you
[3941.94 → 3943.06] To befriend you
[3943.06 → 3945.58] Do not be afraid
[3945.58 → 3947.70] Let the blessing of God
[3947.70 → 3948.64] Come upon you today
[3948.64 → 3950.66] Do not be afraid
[3950.66 → 3953.34] But go in peace
[3953.34 → 3956.36] To love and serve the Lord
[3956.36 → 3958.16] Amen
[3958.16 → 3966.92] Let the wilderness
[3966.92 → 3968.98] And the towns
[3968.98 → 3970.20] Raise their voices
[3970.20 → 3972.14] Let them shout
[3972.14 → 3973.66] From the mountaintops
[3977.70 → 3983.34] Go tell it on the mountain
[3983.34 → 3987.96] Over the hills and everywhere
[3987.96 → 3992.14] Go tell it on the mountain
[3992.14 → 3996.50] That Jesus Christ is born
[3996.50 → 4000.90] While shepherds kept their watching
[4000.90 → 4003.86] Or silent flocks
[4003.86 → 4004.86] By night
[4004.86 → 4006.82] Behold the world
[4006.82 → 4007.82] Behold the world
[4007.82 → 4008.82] The heavens
[4008.82 → 4012.82] There shone a holy light
[4012.82 → 4017.82] Go tell it on the mountain
[4017.82 → 4019.82] Go tell it on the mountain
[4019.82 → 4024.14] Over the hills and everywhere
[4024.14 → 4028.20] Go tell it on the mountain
[4028.20 → 4032.22] That Jesus Christ is born
[4032.22 → 4033.22] The shepherds
[4033.22 → 4037.18] The shepherds feared and trembled
[4037.18 → 4041.18] Yet low upon the earth
[4041.18 → 4043.14] Rang out the angels
[4043.14 → 4045.14] Rang out the angels' chorus
[4045.14 → 4049.78] That hailed our Saviour's birth
[4049.78 → 4055.14] Go tell it on the mountain
[4055.14 → 4059.44] Over the hills and everywhere
[4059.44 → 4063.44] Go tell it on the mountain
[4063.44 → 4067.40] That Jesus Christ is born
[4067.40 → 4068.24] That Jesus Christ is born
[4068.24 → 4071.90] Down in the lowly stable
[4071.90 → 4076.36] The humble Christ was born
[4076.36 → 4080.36] And God sent us salvation
[4080.36 → 4085.24] That blessed Christmas morn
[4085.24 → 4090.20] Go tell it on the mountain
[4090.20 → 4095.20] Over the hills and everywhere
[4095.20 → 4099.08] Go tell it on the mountain
[4099.08 → 4103.20] That Jesus Christ is born
[4103.20 → 4118.56] A Christmas tradition in our church
[4118.56 → 4121.12] that is reflective of the Dutch heritage
[4121.12 → 4122.66] of some of our members
[4122.66 → 4125.48] is to close the Christmas Day service
[4125.48 → 4127.38] with this next song

[4138.28 → 4140.60] in whichever language you prefer
