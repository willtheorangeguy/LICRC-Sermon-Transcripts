[0.00 --> 8.16]  So long status quo, I think I'll just let go
[8.16 --> 14.84]  You make me wanna be brave, I wanna be brave
[14.84 --> 21.04]  The way it always was, it's no longer good enough
[21.04 --> 25.90]  You make me wanna be brave
[25.90 --> 28.80]  Brave
[28.80 --> 34.16]  Brave
[34.16 --> 36.18]  Brave
[36.18 --> 37.60]  Brave
[37.60 --> 39.42]  Brave
[44.48 --> 48.48]  Brave
[48.48 --> 50.48]  Brave
[50.48 --> 51.40]  Brave
[51.40 --> 52.48]  Brave
[52.48 --> 53.68]  Brave
[53.68 --> 53.96]  Brave
[53.96 --> 54.68]  Brave
[54.68 --> 55.84]  Brave
[55.84 --> 55.88]  Brave
[55.88 --> 56.00]  Brave
[56.00 --> 56.04]  Brave
[56.04 --> 56.86]  Brave
[56.86 --> 58.12]  Brave
[58.12 --> 58.32]  Brave
[58.32 --> 67.70]  Have you been praying and you still have no answer?
[69.44 --> 74.54]  Have you been pouring out your heart for so many years?
[76.00 --> 82.12]  Have you been hoping that things would have changed by now?
[82.96 --> 88.30]  Have you cried all the faith you have through so many tears?
[88.32 --> 118.30]  Have you been praying and you still have no answer?
[118.32 --> 120.32]  Have you been praying and you still have no answer?
[120.32 --> 128.32]  Have you been praying and you still have no answer?
[128.32 --> 130.32]  Have you been praying and you still have no answer?
[130.32 --> 134.32]  Have you been praying and you still have no answer?
[134.32 --> 139.48]  Maybe you just haven't seen it, just haven't seen it again
[139.48 --> 144.18]  Maybe you just haven't seen it
[144.18 --> 150.26]  He had the solution before you had the problem
[150.26 --> 156.94]  Since he's the best in you and you feel like you're worst
[156.94 --> 164.62]  So in the questioning, don't ever doubt this love for you
[164.62 --> 170.52]  Cause it's only in this love that you'll find a breakthrough
[170.52 --> 175.40]  It's like the fires, the sun rise
[175.40 --> 179.40]  Waiting on the other side, on the darkest night
[179.40 --> 182.80]  Don't ever lose hope, hold on and believe
[182.80 --> 187.30]  Maybe you just haven't seen it, just haven't seen it again
[187.30 --> 189.90]  He's closer than you think you are
[189.90 --> 193.10]  Holding меня from the breaking of those
[193.10 --> 196.18]  All his promises are just up again
[196.18 --> 201.20]  Maybe you just haven't seen it, just haven't seen it again
[201.20 --> 208.00]  Maybe you just haven't seen it, just haven't seen it again
[208.00 --> 212.18]  Maybe you just haven't seen it
[212.18 --> 216.44]  He is moving with a love so deep
[216.44 --> 219.74]  Hallelujah for the victory
[219.74 --> 223.24]  Good things are coming even when we can't save
[223.24 --> 225.42]  We can't see yet
[225.42 --> 227.10]  But we believe that
[227.10 --> 230.20]  He is moving with a love so deep
[230.20 --> 233.44]  Hallelujah for the victory
[233.44 --> 237.10]  Good things are coming even when we can't save
[237.10 --> 239.18]  We can't see yet
[239.18 --> 241.04]  But we believe that
[241.04 --> 243.98]  It's like the bright, the sun will rise
[243.98 --> 247.96]  Waiting on the other side, on the darkest night
[247.96 --> 251.24]  Don't ever lose, hold on to the family
[251.24 --> 255.86]  Maybe you just haven't seen it, just haven't seen it yet
[255.86 --> 258.02]  Keep going for anything you want
[258.02 --> 261.60]  All the moments from the breaking blood
[261.60 --> 264.82]  All these promises are just up ahead
[264.82 --> 269.68]  Maybe you just haven't seen it, just haven't seen it yet
[271.04 --> 276.54]  Maybe you just haven't seen it, just haven't seen it yet
[276.54 --> 283.30]  Maybe you just haven't seen it, just haven't seen it yet
[283.30 --> 290.64]  Baby you just haven't seen it, just haven't seen it yet
[301.04 --> 302.96]  One, two, three, four.
[331.04 --> 361.02]  One, two, three, four.
[361.04 --> 391.02]  One, two, three, four.
[391.04 --> 421.02]  One, two, three, four.
[421.02 --> 451.00]  One, two, three, four.
[451.00 --> 453.00]  One, two, three, four.
[453.00 --> 455.00]  One, two, three, four.
[455.00 --> 457.00]  One, two, three, four.
[457.00 --> 459.00]  One, two, three, four.
[459.00 --> 461.00]  One, two, three, four.
[461.00 --> 463.00]  One, two, three, four.
[463.00 --> 465.00]  One, two, three, four.
[465.00 --> 467.00]  One, two, three, four.
[467.00 --> 469.00]  One, two, three, four.
[469.00 --> 471.00]  One, two, three, four.
[471.00 --> 473.00]  One, two, three, four.
[473.00 --> 475.00]  One, two, three, four.
[475.00 --> 477.00]  One, two, three, four.
[477.00 --> 479.00]  One, two, three, four.
[479.00 --> 482.68]  When I'm standing up, I'm out today
[482.68 --> 485.62]  Didn't get there on my own
[485.62 --> 488.40]  When I'm walking through the barrier
[488.40 --> 490.80]  Now I am not alone
[490.80 --> 494.26]  You're better than hills and baddies
[494.26 --> 496.92]  Hills and baddies
[496.92 --> 500.00]  You're better than hills and baddies
[500.00 --> 502.08]  But I'm not alone
[502.08 --> 505.72]  You're better than hills and baddies
[505.72 --> 508.36]  Hills and baddies
[508.36 --> 511.44]  You're better than hills and baddies
[511.44 --> 513.10]  But I'm getting ready
[513.10 --> 515.20]  And I'm not alone
[515.20 --> 518.34]  And I will choose to say
[518.34 --> 521.40]  Blessed be your name
[521.40 --> 525.72]  And I am not alone
[535.72 --> 538.88]  Though, there's a businessróp
[538.88 --> 540.26]  We'll have a bit of life
[540.26 --> 541.14]  That's my business

[565.02 --> 570.18]  Good morning, everyone.
[572.04 --> 573.02]  There you go.
[574.02 --> 575.30]  No wonder you didn't respond.
[576.68 --> 579.00]  It was like in the old movies from on high.
[580.22 --> 580.94]  Okay, good morning.
[582.14 --> 584.50]  Welcome to worship.
[584.68 --> 585.30]  My name is Chris.
[585.48 --> 588.68]  I'm one of the pastors here, and we're excited to worship this morning.
[588.68 --> 593.86]  We are particularly excited today because we have the opportunity to witness three professions
[593.86 --> 598.78]  of faith, and that's always a really awesome time in the life of our church.
[599.42 --> 606.04]  We get to hear how God has been faithful to these three, we'll say, relatively young people
[606.04 --> 610.16]  as they stand here and share their story with us.
[610.64 --> 615.06]  As we gather to worship today, just a couple announcements.
[615.72 --> 622.00]  First, there is a youth disc golf event on Wednesday at Passive Park.
[622.00 --> 628.00]  And if you want to participate in that and you consider yourself a youth, or if you would
[628.00 --> 633.56]  like to challenge the youth and defeat them all, you can meet at Passive Park in the evening.
[633.72 --> 637.20]  But before that, talk to Noah or Josh.
[637.30 --> 638.10]  Noah, where are you?
[638.96 --> 639.46]  Hand up.
[639.62 --> 640.06]  Big wave.
[640.20 --> 640.66]  Thank you.
[640.80 --> 641.56]  Josh, where are you?
[641.66 --> 642.04]  Hand up.
[642.10 --> 642.50]  Big wave.
[642.58 --> 643.02]  There you go.
[643.42 --> 643.88]  Grab them.
[643.96 --> 646.10]  They have information after the service.
[646.10 --> 653.86]  Also, for the youth, Reactivate is happening in September, and the sign-up for that will
[653.86 --> 655.38]  be coming to you shortly.
[655.60 --> 660.78]  So keep your eyes and inboxes open, ready for that to happen as well.
[662.24 --> 666.94]  Finally, as we do Profession of Faith today, we're welcoming these young people into membership
[666.94 --> 667.56]  of the church.
[668.18 --> 671.50]  We know that there's a couple other people who have been thinking about pastor's class
[671.50 --> 674.16]  and who want to do Profession of Faith as well.
[674.16 --> 677.66]  If that's you, talk to myself or to Pastor Kevin after the service.
[678.14 --> 683.16]  Also, if you have been visiting with us either in person or online and you want to talk about
[683.16 --> 687.48]  membership and what that might look like, becoming part of our covenant family, gather
[687.48 --> 688.36]  me after the service.
[688.48 --> 692.40]  There's a few people that we're going to be connecting with over the next little while
[692.40 --> 693.46]  in that regard too.
[693.70 --> 696.38]  And so grab me and we'll have a good conversation about that.
[697.82 --> 698.82]  I think that's it.
[699.56 --> 700.84]  All right, let's worship God together.
[700.84 --> 703.50]  Can I ask you to stand if you are able and where you are?
[703.50 --> 707.48]  And God is going to usher us into his presence with his greeting.
[711.04 --> 714.64]  Open your hearts then to receive the greeting of our God.
[716.04 --> 722.18]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son,
[722.44 --> 726.24]  and our Savior through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[727.04 --> 727.42]  Amen.
[727.92 --> 728.68]  Let's worship God.
[728.68 --> 735.22]  Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 145.
[736.22 --> 741.62]  The Lord is righteous in all his ways and faithful in all he does.
[742.36 --> 749.32]  The Lord is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth.
[749.32 --> 752.84]  My mouth will speak in praise of the Lord.
[753.52 --> 757.42]  Let every creature praise his holy name forever and ever.
[757.42 --> 766.96]  Be my kind, God of Abraham.
[766.96 --> 785.48]  Lead me by your hand, you are strong and wise.
[785.48 --> 790.72]  I want to trust in you and in all I do.
[790.82 --> 793.46]  Bring you honor and praise.
[793.46 --> 801.64]  How I love you, great and mighty King.
[801.88 --> 811.58]  You are faithful through the ages you never change.
[811.58 --> 817.56]  Be my kind, God of Abraham.
[817.56 --> 818.56]  Be my kind, God of Abraham.
[818.56 --> 821.64]  Be my kind in the dark of night.
[821.92 --> 825.86]  Set all fear to fight you, our hope and truth.
[826.92 --> 831.76]  I want to trust in you and in all I do.
[831.90 --> 834.56]  Bring you honor and praise.
[834.56 --> 842.66]  How I love you, great and mighty King.
[842.66 --> 852.68]  You are faithful through the ages you never change.
[852.68 --> 874.66]  Be my kind, God of Abraham.
[874.66 --> 878.06]  Be my guide for the road ahead.
[878.06 --> 883.16]  Should I feel misled, you are just and good.
[884.20 --> 889.20]  I want to trust in you and in all I do.
[889.38 --> 892.16]  Bring you honor and praise.
[892.16 --> 900.46]  How I love you, great and mighty King.
[900.46 --> 909.06]  You are faithful through the ages you never change.
[909.06 --> 916.86]  How I love you, great and mighty King.
[916.86 --> 927.14]  You are faithful through the ages you never change.
[933.32 --> 940.50]  The Lord is trustworthy in all he promises and faithful in all he does.
[940.50 --> 946.64]  The Lord upholds all who fall and lifts up all who are bowed down.
[946.64 --> 953.48]  The eyes of all look to you and you give them their food at the proper time.
[953.48 --> 959.34]  You open your hand and satisfy the desires of every living thing.
[970.50 --> 973.64]  The Lord is warments of every living thing.
[973.64 --> 976.04]  The Lord isundoly with us.
[976.04 --> 978.98]  Thank you.
[979.00 --> 980.54]  The Lord is Military Jacks Perfection

[1008.48 --> 1011.22]  Lord, I need you.
[1011.56 --> 1015.80]  Oh, I need you.
[1015.80 --> 1022.80]  Every hour I need you.
[1022.80 --> 1029.60]  My one defense, my righteousness.
[1030.50 --> 1035.42]  Oh, God, how I need you.
[1039.42 --> 1046.80]  Where sin runs deep, your grace is more.
[1046.80 --> 1053.80]  Where grace is found is where you are.
[1054.60 --> 1060.80]  And where you are, Lord, I am free.
[1061.98 --> 1067.50]  Holiness is Christ in me.
[1067.50 --> 1075.02]  And where you are, Lord, I am free.
[1075.96 --> 1082.50]  Holiness is Christ in me.
[1082.50 --> 1089.16]  Lord, I need you.
[1089.48 --> 1093.72]  Oh, I need you.
[1094.58 --> 1100.50]  Every hour I need you.
[1100.50 --> 1107.28]  My one defense, my righteousness.
[1108.04 --> 1113.50]  Oh, God, how I need you.
[1115.26 --> 1119.00]  So put my eyes to you.
[1119.00 --> 1126.00]  When temptation comes my way.
[1126.80 --> 1131.24]  And when I cannot stand, I'll fall on you.
[1133.24 --> 1137.38]  Jesus, you're my hope and stay.
[1137.38 --> 1156.38]  Lord, I need you.
[1156.38 --> 1161.38]  Oh, I need you.
[1161.38 --> 1167.38]  Every hour I need you.
[1167.38 --> 1174.50]  My one defense, my righteousness.
[1175.42 --> 1180.06]  Oh, God, how I need you.
[1180.06 --> 1210.04]  Lord, I need you.
[1210.06 --> 1217.06]  My one defense, my righteousness.
[1217.06 --> 1224.06]  Oh, God, how I need you.
[1224.06 --> 1227.02]  Oh, God, how I need you.
[1227.06 --> 1233.06]  Oh, God, how I need you.
[1233.06 --> 1239.06]  Oh, God, how I need you.
[1239.06 --> 1269.04]  Speak, O Lord, as we come to you,
[1269.04 --> 1277.24]  To receive the food of your holy word
[1277.24 --> 1283.72]  Take your truth, plant it deep in us
[1283.72 --> 1291.32]  Shape and fashion us in your likeness
[1291.32 --> 1298.38]  Where the Lord of Christ might be seen today
[1298.38 --> 1306.78]  In our acts of love and our deeds of faith
[1306.78 --> 1313.32]  Speak, O Lord, and fulfill in us
[1313.32 --> 1320.46]  For your purposes, for your glory
[1320.46 --> 1335.42]  Teach us, Lord, full obedience
[1335.42 --> 1343.22]  Holy reverence, true humility
[1343.22 --> 1350.60]  Test our thoughts and our attitudes
[1350.60 --> 1358.18]  In the radiance of your purity
[1358.18 --> 1362.46]  Cause our faith to rise
[1362.46 --> 1365.78]  Cause our lives to see
[1365.78 --> 1373.16]  Your majestic love and authority
[1373.16 --> 1380.70]  Words of power that can never fail
[1380.70 --> 1387.78]  Let their truth prevail over unbelief
[1387.78 --> 1403.82]  Speak, O Lord, and renew our minds
[1403.82 --> 1412.40]  Help us grasp the heights of your plans for us
[1412.40 --> 1419.42]  Truths unchanged from the dawn of time
[1419.78 --> 1426.46]  That will echo down through eternity
[1426.46 --> 1434.14]  And by grace we'll stand on your promises
[1434.14 --> 1442.52]  And by faith we'll walk as you walk with us
[1442.52 --> 1449.68]  Speak, O Lord, till your church is built
[1449.68 --> 1456.88]  And the earth is filled with your glory
[1456.88 --> 1461.14]  You may have a seat
[1461.14 --> 1461.16]  You may have a seat
[1461.16 --> 1464.26]  You may have a seat
[1464.26 --> 1494.24]  You may have a seat
[1494.26 --> 1495.94]  You may have a seat
[1495.94 --> 1510.14]  You may have a seat
[1510.14 --> 1511.68]  I love speaking so much
[1511.68 --> 1514.66]  And so we are going to hear their testimonies right now
[1514.66 --> 1515.44]  We have today
[1515.44 --> 1518.22]  Jared Elkma, Hadassah Klosterhough
[1518.22 --> 1520.28]  And Noah Hubert
[1520.28 --> 1520.94]  Are going to come forward
[1520.94 --> 1522.36]  So I'm going to invite them
[1522.36 --> 1523.80]  And their mentor up
[1523.80 --> 1524.60]  One at a time
[1524.60 --> 1525.26]  And we're going to start
[1525.26 --> 1526.76]  With Jared Elkma
[1526.76 --> 1527.76]  And Josh Chamberlain
[1527.76 --> 1528.64]  You can come forward as well
[1528.64 --> 1547.68]  My name is Jared
[1547.68 --> 1551.86]  So when I started thinking about
[1551.86 --> 1553.00]  What I wanted to share
[1553.00 --> 1553.94]  I was trying to find
[1553.94 --> 1557.46]  Some big, inspiring, life-changing experience
[1557.46 --> 1558.20]  That I could share
[1558.20 --> 1560.28]  But nothing was coming to mind
[1560.28 --> 1561.94]  And the more I thought about it
[1561.94 --> 1562.80]  The more I realized
[1562.80 --> 1565.08]  That I've had life-changing people around me
[1565.08 --> 1566.10]  For my entire life
[1566.10 --> 1567.60]  People that have stopped
[1567.60 --> 1568.38]  And made me think
[1568.38 --> 1569.66]  I want to be like them
[1569.66 --> 1572.26]  And I realized yesterday
[1572.26 --> 1573.86]  As I was talking to a member
[1573.86 --> 1574.68]  Of this congregation
[1574.68 --> 1576.80]  That that's God shining through us
[1576.80 --> 1578.22]  They pointed that out to me
[1578.22 --> 1579.94]  And which I thought was pretty cool
[1579.94 --> 1582.50]  And I think it's the little things like that
[1582.50 --> 1583.70]  From lots of different people
[1583.70 --> 1586.36]  That are constantly changing
[1586.36 --> 1587.36]  And shaping me
[1587.36 --> 1588.62]  Into who I am now
[1588.62 --> 1590.64]  And where my faith is now as well
[1590.64 --> 1593.78]  So having a crazy, eye-opening experience
[1593.78 --> 1595.80]  Isn't necessary to a strong faith
[1595.80 --> 1597.42]  And a good relationship with God
[1597.42 --> 1600.64]  But you do need two things
[1600.64 --> 1602.44]  Support and community
[1602.44 --> 1604.02]  And there are countless examples
[1604.02 --> 1605.18]  Of our church supporting
[1605.18 --> 1607.42]  And creating a loving, caring community
[1607.42 --> 1608.60]  And that's why I'm excited
[1608.60 --> 1609.80]  To profess my faith
[1609.80 --> 1611.80]  In front of this awesome community
[1611.80 --> 1614.04]  That has played a huge part in my life
[1614.04 --> 1617.74]  Ecclesiastes 4, 9, and 10
[1617.74 --> 1619.38]  Says two are better than one
[1619.38 --> 1621.28]  Because they have good return for their labor
[1621.28 --> 1622.64]  If either falls down
[1622.64 --> 1623.92]  One can help the other up
[1623.92 --> 1625.56]  And that's exactly what I've seen
[1625.56 --> 1627.78]  This community do over and over again
[1627.78 --> 1629.34]  Helping a church member
[1629.34 --> 1630.18]  When they have fallen
[1630.18 --> 1633.60]  And knowing that they have the support
[1633.60 --> 1635.16]  Of a whole church behind them
[1635.16 --> 1643.52]  Okay
[1643.52 --> 1646.92]  The first time I went for lunch with Jared
[1646.92 --> 1649.06]  Was at Ricky's up the hill
[1649.06 --> 1651.84]  He didn't make it easy to get to know him
[1651.84 --> 1653.94]  Because he would only answer with one word
[1653.94 --> 1655.06]  Every question
[1655.06 --> 1657.34]  I'd say, how are you doing?
[1657.60 --> 1657.92]  Good
[1657.92 --> 1659.52]  So how's the family?
[1659.78 --> 1660.10]  Good
[1660.10 --> 1661.72]  What's your favorite thing?
[1662.20 --> 1662.58]  Sports
[1662.58 --> 1665.40]  It's nothing else
[1665.40 --> 1671.08]  It took about the whole time
[1671.08 --> 1673.04]  I think the first time he said
[1673.04 --> 1674.74]  A full sentence to me was yesterday
[1674.74 --> 1678.92]  When he asked me to do this
[1679.48 --> 1685.70]  Jared doesn't waste his energy
[1685.70 --> 1687.30]  He doesn't waste his time
[1687.30 --> 1690.42]  Sometimes that's because people think he's lazy
[1690.42 --> 1692.98]  But when he's playing hockey
[1692.98 --> 1695.00]  Like I got a watch the other day
[1695.00 --> 1697.18]  The ball would go up
[1697.18 --> 1698.20]  They would lose control
[1698.20 --> 1699.74]  And it would go to the other side of the field
[1699.74 --> 1703.54]  And he would just nonchalantly walk to the middle line
[1703.54 --> 1706.14]  While the rest of his team rushes to the front
[1706.14 --> 1710.32]  That's not because he's lazy
[1710.32 --> 1711.44]  Or he doesn't want to run
[1711.44 --> 1712.84]  It's because he knows he doesn't have to
[1712.84 --> 1714.96]  Because the ball is going to come right back
[1714.96 --> 1716.26]  Because his team is going to lose it
[1716.26 --> 1717.94]  And then he's going to have to catch it for them
[1717.94 --> 1724.34]  In 2020 and in Bible studies
[1724.34 --> 1727.08]  He, like before, wouldn't say very much
[1727.08 --> 1729.54]  But when he asked his one question that he would ask
[1729.54 --> 1731.08]  It was always to the heart
[1731.08 --> 1733.78]  And it was always the one question that mattered
[1733.78 --> 1737.88]  This is because Jared is wise
[1737.88 --> 1739.84]  He doesn't waste time
[1739.84 --> 1742.08]  He seeks the right path
[1742.08 --> 1743.22]  And he goes down it
[1743.22 --> 1745.96]  Whatever he's doing
[1745.96 --> 1747.56]  He does to his best
[1747.56 --> 1751.08]  Proverbs 1.7 says
[1751.08 --> 1753.22]  The fear of the Lord is the beginning of all wisdom
[1753.22 --> 1758.26]  Today, Jared has used the wisdom
[1758.26 --> 1760.10]  That God has given him to choose God
[1760.10 --> 1762.20]  To respond back to his call
[1762.20 --> 1767.10]  Continue to seek God, Jared
[1767.10 --> 1768.10]  Because you're a great man
[1768.10 --> 1768.94]  And you're a wise man
[1768.94 --> 1781.22]  I got caught up in a hug there
[1781.22 --> 1781.78]  That was nice
[1781.78 --> 1784.94]  I'm going to invite Hadassah Klosterhof
[1784.94 --> 1785.54]  She's going to come up
[1785.54 --> 1786.80]  And she's going to share her testimony
[1786.80 --> 1788.88]  Her mentor is Heather Vartstra
[1788.88 --> 1790.78]  But sadly she's not able to be here today
[1790.78 --> 1792.86]  So Heather's written up a beautiful little thing
[1792.86 --> 1793.60]  That I get to read
[1793.60 --> 1795.00]  So we'll get to that in a second
[1795.00 --> 1796.68]  But that's where Heather is right now
[1797.68 --> 1805.86]  Okay, so I wasn't really sure what to do for this
[1805.86 --> 1809.72]  Because my whole life has been very, like, laid out for me
[1809.72 --> 1812.66]  I haven't had a lot of, like, struggles when it comes to faith
[1812.66 --> 1814.40]  Because I've grown up in this church
[1814.40 --> 1815.64]  I went to a Christian school
[1815.64 --> 1817.58]  Not many big events have happened
[1817.58 --> 1819.40]  But the past year
[1819.40 --> 1821.76]  I've really been, like, working on that
[1821.76 --> 1824.40]  Because I've never really had to make my faith my own
[1824.40 --> 1828.12]  But especially in the last term of school
[1828.12 --> 1829.20]  When I had Bible class
[1829.20 --> 1831.24]  I was really learning how to do that
[1831.24 --> 1832.64]  And how to make my faith my own
[1832.64 --> 1834.24]  And now I'm graduated
[1834.24 --> 1835.68]  And I have to make my life my own
[1835.68 --> 1837.64]  And I think this is the next step for me
[1837.64 --> 1839.10]  For making my faith my own
[1839.10 --> 1841.14]  So, yeah, that's it
[1841.14 --> 1846.18]  All right, so again
[1846.18 --> 1847.60]  These are Heather's words
[1847.60 --> 1849.30]  I mean, I feel them too
[1849.30 --> 1850.24]  But these are Heather's words
[1850.24 --> 1851.44]  So when you hear I
[1851.44 --> 1852.24]  It's not me
[1852.24 --> 1853.08]  It's Heather Vartstra
[1853.08 --> 1854.26]  So this is what Heather says
[1854.26 --> 1854.70]  She says
[1854.70 --> 1856.82]  Happy profession of faith, Hadassah
[1856.82 --> 1858.50]  Wish I could be here in person
[1858.50 --> 1859.88]  But I'm thankful this can get read
[1859.88 --> 1862.64]  I have had the privilege of being Hadassah's youth leader
[1862.64 --> 1863.88]  For the past five years
[1863.88 --> 1867.52]  Hadassah is kind, caring, fun, loving
[1867.52 --> 1869.84]  And overall an amazing young lady
[1869.84 --> 1872.40]  One of the things that I have always admired about Hadassah
[1872.40 --> 1874.28]  Is the wisdom she has in her faith
[1874.28 --> 1877.22]  Not only does she know her Bible better than I do
[1877.22 --> 1877.78]  Heather
[1877.78 --> 1880.80]  But she also actively strives to live it out
[1880.80 --> 1882.38]  She thinks of others
[1882.38 --> 1883.38]  Prays intentionally
[1883.38 --> 1885.42]  And offers biblical advice to her peers
[1885.42 --> 1887.28]  Hadassah probably knows her Bible better than me too
[1887.28 --> 1887.56]  So
[1887.56 --> 1891.46]  She has provided so much insight into our small group
[1891.46 --> 1893.14]  And I have learned so much from her
[1893.14 --> 1895.94]  I am just so thankful she is standing up here today
[1895.94 --> 1897.26]  To share her faith with us all
[1897.26 --> 1899.34]  I have a verse to share with you, Hadassah
[1899.34 --> 1901.90]  And it's paraphrased from my favorite devotional
[1901.90 --> 1903.46]  Come Away, My Beloved
[1903.46 --> 1904.56]  By Francis Roberts
[1904.56 --> 1905.94]  It says
[1905.94 --> 1907.66]  I have led you in right paths
[1907.66 --> 1910.12]  When you walk, your steps will not be hindered
[1910.12 --> 1912.22]  And when you run, you will not stumble
[1912.22 --> 1914.58]  It comes from Proverbs 4, 11, and 12
[1914.58 --> 1917.12]  I'm so proud of you, Hadassah
[1917.12 --> 1918.52]  Always be you
[1918.52 --> 1920.40]  And trust Jesus with your whole heart
[1920.40 --> 1922.00]  He will always be with you
[1922.00 --> 1924.00]  He will always help you
[1924.00 --> 1925.70]  And he will always show you the way
[1925.70 --> 1928.00]  Keep sharing your wise heart for the Lord
[1928.00 --> 1928.90]  And with the world
[1928.90 --> 1930.08]  Love, Heather
[1930.08 --> 1939.90]  Alright, and thirdly
[1939.90 --> 1941.52]  We have Noah Hubertz
[1941.52 --> 1942.50]  Is going to come forward
[1942.50 --> 1944.02]  And his spiritual mentor is
[1944.02 --> 1945.12]  Nathan Visser
[1945.12 --> 1962.56]  So the past few days
[1962.56 --> 1963.08]  Like Jared
[1963.08 --> 1964.90]  I was trying to plan something to say
[1964.90 --> 1967.18]  And Kevin told me to write it on a piece of paper
[1967.18 --> 1968.86]  So I wrote it on my hand
[1968.86 --> 1971.16]  But it never made it on my hand either
[1971.16 --> 1973.12]  So I'm going for it
[1973.12 --> 1974.88]  I have these two friends
[1974.88 --> 1976.06]  One was up here
[1976.06 --> 1976.78]  Jared
[1976.78 --> 1981.64]  And another one is here on this world somewhere
[1981.64 --> 1982.40]  I don't know where he is
[1982.40 --> 1983.12]  It's Carson Grimm
[1983.12 --> 1986.12]  Oh, he is maybe here
[1986.12 --> 1986.60]  I don't know
[1986.60 --> 1988.46]  So those are two people
[1988.46 --> 1990.34]  That I've always looked down to
[1990.34 --> 1991.08]  But also up to
[1991.08 --> 1992.56]  First is Jared
[1992.56 --> 1994.60]  Like Josh said before
[1994.60 --> 1995.56]  He's pretty wise
[1995.56 --> 1996.86]  And he takes things seriously
[1996.86 --> 1998.52]  He wants to
[1998.52 --> 1999.72]  Think about things
[1999.72 --> 2001.36]  Before he does them
[2001.36 --> 2002.28]  It's something that I've
[2002.28 --> 2003.62]  Wanted to do with my faith
[2003.62 --> 2004.74]  I wanted to think about it
[2004.74 --> 2005.76]  And
[2005.76 --> 2008.38]  Know that the time was right
[2008.38 --> 2009.90]  So I've done that most of my life
[2009.90 --> 2010.10]  But
[2010.10 --> 2012.28]  I kind of wanted to change that as well
[2012.28 --> 2013.22]  And that's when my
[2013.22 --> 2014.82]  Crazy friend Carson comes in
[2014.82 --> 2015.38]  And he
[2015.38 --> 2017.12]  Doesn't usually think about it
[2017.12 --> 2018.04]  And he just does it
[2018.04 --> 2018.94]  So
[2018.94 --> 2021.08]  I wanted to do that today
[2021.08 --> 2022.20]  I wanted to go for it
[2022.20 --> 2023.32]  That's not a bad thing
[2023.32 --> 2024.02]  Going for it
[2024.02 --> 2025.90]  But I wanted to really
[2025.90 --> 2027.50]  Take the next step in my faith
[2027.50 --> 2029.22]  This church has been amazing
[2029.22 --> 2030.56]  And I'm really thankful that
[2030.56 --> 2031.64]  I've been a part of it
[2031.64 --> 2032.82]  And taking that next step
[2032.82 --> 2034.42]  For me
[2034.42 --> 2035.28]  Will be
[2035.28 --> 2036.38]  A great step
[2036.38 --> 2036.70]  And
[2036.70 --> 2038.20]  Filling those shoes
[2038.20 --> 2039.48]  Won't be that difficult for me
[2039.48 --> 2039.68]  So
[2039.68 --> 2040.10]  Yeah
[2040.10 --> 2045.78]  All right
[2045.78 --> 2052.06]  All right
[2052.06 --> 2053.36]  Just something I wrote up yesterday
[2053.36 --> 2054.36]  Thinking about this
[2054.36 --> 2055.64]  Holy
[2055.64 --> 2056.34]  This thing moves
[2056.34 --> 2057.86]  Noah
[2057.86 --> 2058.80]  While I've been thinking about
[2058.80 --> 2060.28]  What to say on this big day of yours
[2060.28 --> 2061.76]  One thing kept coming back to me
[2061.76 --> 2064.10]  You've literally been a part of my entire adult life
[2064.10 --> 2064.62]  So far
[2064.62 --> 2065.98]  All the way from me graduating
[2065.98 --> 2066.98]  To this point now
[2066.98 --> 2068.92]  I don't think you understand the impact
[2068.92 --> 2070.44]  That you've had on my life personally
[2070.44 --> 2073.56]  Your consistent dedication to doing the right thing
[2073.56 --> 2075.70]  Asking and answering the tough questions
[2075.70 --> 2077.24]  And standing firmly in your faith
[2077.24 --> 2078.50]  Has impacted myself
[2078.50 --> 2079.74]  And everyone else
[2079.74 --> 2080.96]  Who finds himself blessed enough
[2080.96 --> 2081.76]  To be around you
[2081.76 --> 2083.78]  As you stand in front of this
[2083.78 --> 2085.50]  Bodies of brothers and sisters in Christ
[2085.50 --> 2086.96]  I want you to look at all the faces
[2086.96 --> 2088.02]  Of support and love
[2088.02 --> 2089.84]  These are the people who promised you
[2089.84 --> 2090.90]  Noah as a child
[2090.90 --> 2092.22]  That they would encourage you
[2092.22 --> 2093.26]  Uplift you
[2093.26 --> 2094.28]  And help you develop
[2094.28 --> 2095.28]  In your everyday walk
[2095.28 --> 2096.16]  With our Lord and Savior
[2096.16 --> 2098.82]  As you publicly profess your faith
[2098.82 --> 2099.90]  In front of this group of people
[2099.90 --> 2100.94]  I want to remind you
[2100.94 --> 2101.78]  That this isn't the end
[2101.78 --> 2102.94]  Of that beautiful relationship
[2102.94 --> 2103.94]  I encourage you
[2103.94 --> 2104.90]  To use these people
[2104.90 --> 2106.46]  To continue to grow
[2106.46 --> 2107.90]  Into an amazing man of God
[2107.90 --> 2110.50]  While you profess your faith here today
[2110.50 --> 2111.94]  I want to give you a word of caution
[2111.94 --> 2113.14]  Of trials and tribulations
[2113.14 --> 2113.86]  You'll be put through
[2113.86 --> 2114.66]  Beyond these walls
[2114.66 --> 2115.88]  I want to encourage you
[2115.88 --> 2117.30]  To root yourself in the cross
[2117.30 --> 2118.82]  And use those trials
[2118.82 --> 2120.54]  To strengthen and profess your faith
[2120.54 --> 2121.68]  Daily beyond this building
[2121.68 --> 2124.98]  Quickly a word from Hebrews 10
[2124.98 --> 2126.16]  Let us hold fast
[2126.16 --> 2127.54]  The confession of our hope
[2127.54 --> 2128.40]  Without wavering
[2128.40 --> 2130.38]  For he who promised is faithful
[2130.38 --> 2132.10]  And let us consider one another
[2132.10 --> 2133.42]  In order to stir up love
[2133.42 --> 2134.22]  And good works
[2134.22 --> 2135.90]  Not forsaking the assembly
[2135.90 --> 2136.86]  Of ourselves together
[2136.86 --> 2138.28]  As is the manner of some
[2138.28 --> 2140.02]  But exhorting one another
[2140.02 --> 2141.26]  And so much the more
[2141.26 --> 2142.54]  As you see the day approaching
[2142.54 --> 2144.78]  Noah, I don't think you understand
[2144.78 --> 2146.02]  How beyond honored I am
[2146.02 --> 2146.88]  To be the one you asked
[2146.88 --> 2147.60]  To speak here today
[2147.60 --> 2148.32]  On your behalf
[2148.32 --> 2149.78]  I'm happy to now have you
[2149.78 --> 2150.98]  As a friend rather than a youth
[2150.98 --> 2151.70]  Congratulations
[2151.70 --> 2161.32]  Thank you
[2162.10 --> 2163.92]  We're well sorry
[2163.92 --> 2166.86]  I will invite Hadassah back forward
[2166.86 --> 2167.82]  And Jared as well
[2167.82 --> 2168.58]  And then Pastor Chris
[2168.58 --> 2170.02]  Is going to lead you in
[2170.02 --> 2171.88]  The rest of this profession of faith
[2171.88 --> 2182.34]  So we have a bunch of comedians
[2182.34 --> 2183.14]  In this church
[2183.14 --> 2185.02]  Funniest thing there
[2185.02 --> 2185.98]  Was Josh trying to talk
[2185.98 --> 2187.08]  About sports though right
[2187.08 --> 2196.24]  We have a chance this morning
[2196.24 --> 2198.50]  To celebrate with you
[2198.50 --> 2198.94]  Guys
[2198.94 --> 2200.26]  God's faithfulness
[2200.26 --> 2201.54]  And you acknowledging
[2201.54 --> 2203.46]  God's faithfulness
[2203.46 --> 2204.40]  To you
[2204.40 --> 2205.64]  All the way back
[2205.64 --> 2206.78]  In their baptisms
[2206.78 --> 2208.70]  God extended a promise
[2208.70 --> 2209.18]  To them
[2209.18 --> 2210.06]  And called them
[2210.06 --> 2212.00]  To be part of us
[2212.00 --> 2213.02]  And today
[2213.02 --> 2214.68]  You make that promise
[2214.68 --> 2216.14]  Real for yourselves
[2216.14 --> 2217.58]  And we
[2217.58 --> 2219.92]  Are so excited for you
[2219.92 --> 2221.74]  And also for us
[2221.74 --> 2223.04]  As we get to see
[2223.04 --> 2223.60]  God's goodness
[2223.60 --> 2224.54]  Express through you
[2224.54 --> 2225.82]  We're going to ask
[2225.82 --> 2226.48]  Each of you
[2226.48 --> 2227.14]  Some questions
[2227.14 --> 2228.12]  There's four of them
[2228.12 --> 2229.06]  And then I'm going to
[2229.06 --> 2229.86]  Invite you to make
[2229.86 --> 2231.06]  Your profession of faith
[2231.06 --> 2231.82]  In response
[2231.82 --> 2232.46]  You can say
[2232.46 --> 2232.96]  I do
[2232.96 --> 2233.96]  God helping me
[2233.96 --> 2235.34]  And then church
[2235.34 --> 2236.00]  We're going to ask you
[2236.00 --> 2236.60]  A question
[2236.60 --> 2238.52]  To respond with a promise
[2238.52 --> 2239.76]  Of support and encouragement
[2239.76 --> 2240.76]  For them
[2240.76 --> 2241.68]  Just like we did
[2241.68 --> 2243.16]  Many many years ago
[2243.16 --> 2243.96]  In their baptism
[2243.96 --> 2245.58]  We offer that same promise
[2245.58 --> 2246.64]  Again
[2246.64 --> 2248.18]  And so
[2248.18 --> 2249.78]  Jared
[2249.78 --> 2250.64]  Noah
[2250.64 --> 2251.68]  And Hadassah
[2251.68 --> 2253.44]  Do you believe
[2253.44 --> 2254.68]  That Jesus Christ
[2254.68 --> 2255.96]  Is the son of God
[2255.96 --> 2257.22]  Sent to redeem the world
[2257.22 --> 2258.68]  Do you love
[2258.68 --> 2259.56]  And trust him
[2259.56 --> 2260.18]  As the one
[2260.18 --> 2260.98]  Who saves you
[2260.98 --> 2261.78]  From your sin
[2261.78 --> 2262.92]  And do you
[2262.92 --> 2263.72]  With repentance
[2263.72 --> 2264.42]  And joy
[2264.42 --> 2265.58]  Embrace him
[2265.58 --> 2267.02]  As lord of your life
[2267.02 --> 2268.12]  Two
[2268.12 --> 2269.46]  Do you believe
[2269.46 --> 2270.06]  That the Bible
[2270.06 --> 2271.06]  Is the word of God
[2271.06 --> 2272.38]  Revealing Christ
[2272.38 --> 2273.34]  And his redemption
[2273.34 --> 2274.44]  And that the confessions
[2274.44 --> 2275.56]  Of this church
[2275.56 --> 2277.00]  Faithfully reflect
[2277.00 --> 2277.92]  This revelation
[2277.92 --> 2279.96]  Three
[2279.96 --> 2280.96]  Do you accept
[2280.96 --> 2282.20]  The gracious promises
[2282.20 --> 2282.76]  Of God
[2282.76 --> 2283.66]  Sealed to you
[2283.66 --> 2284.44]  In your baptism
[2284.44 --> 2285.82]  And do you affirm
[2285.82 --> 2287.04]  Your union with Christ
[2287.04 --> 2287.82]  And his church
[2287.82 --> 2289.10]  Which your baptism
[2289.10 --> 2290.12]  Signifies
[2290.12 --> 2291.88]  And four
[2291.88 --> 2292.70]  Do you promise
[2292.70 --> 2293.92]  To do all that you can
[2293.92 --> 2294.46]  With the help
[2294.46 --> 2295.30]  Of the Holy Spirit
[2295.30 --> 2296.82]  To strengthen your love
[2296.82 --> 2298.10]  And commitment to Christ
[2298.10 --> 2299.44]  By sharing faithfully
[2299.44 --> 2301.08]  In the life of the church
[2301.08 --> 2302.84]  Honoring and submitting
[2302.84 --> 2303.80]  To its authority
[2303.80 --> 2305.12]  And do you join
[2305.12 --> 2306.46]  With these people
[2306.46 --> 2307.02]  Of God
[2307.02 --> 2307.92]  To do the work
[2307.92 --> 2308.78]  Of the Lord
[2308.78 --> 2309.66]  Everywhere
[2309.66 --> 2311.18]  Hadassah
[2311.18 --> 2311.96]  What is your answer
[2311.96 --> 2314.00]  Jared
[2314.00 --> 2314.90]  What is your answer
[2314.90 --> 2317.10]  Noah
[2317.10 --> 2318.20]  What is your answer
[2318.20 --> 2320.50]  Amen
[2320.50 --> 2322.84]  In the name
[2322.84 --> 2323.44]  Of the Lord
[2323.44 --> 2324.48]  Jesus Christ
[2324.48 --> 2325.42]  Then I now
[2325.42 --> 2326.10]  Welcome you
[2326.10 --> 2327.30]  To all the privileges
[2327.30 --> 2328.98]  Of full communion
[2328.98 --> 2329.98]  I welcome you
[2329.98 --> 2331.38]  To the full participation
[2331.38 --> 2332.26]  In the life
[2332.26 --> 2332.80]  Of the church
[2332.80 --> 2333.44]  I welcome you
[2333.44 --> 2334.46]  To its responsibilities
[2334.46 --> 2335.82]  And its joys
[2335.82 --> 2337.12]  And its sufferings
[2337.12 --> 2338.82]  May the peace
[2338.82 --> 2339.80]  Of God
[2339.80 --> 2340.76]  Who through the blood
[2340.76 --> 2341.78]  Of the eternal covenant
[2341.78 --> 2342.90]  Brought back from the dead
[2342.90 --> 2343.60]  Our Lord
[2343.60 --> 2344.44]  Jesus Christ
[2344.44 --> 2345.48]  The great shepherd
[2345.48 --> 2346.14]  Of the sheep
[2346.14 --> 2347.22]  Equip you
[2347.22 --> 2348.52]  With everything good
[2348.52 --> 2350.38]  For doing his will
[2350.38 --> 2351.62]  And may he work
[2351.62 --> 2352.32]  In us
[2352.32 --> 2353.10]  What is pleasing
[2353.10 --> 2353.56]  To him
[2353.56 --> 2355.04]  Through Jesus Christ
[2355.04 --> 2356.54]  To whom be the glory
[2356.54 --> 2357.12]  Forever
[2357.12 --> 2358.26]  And ever
[2358.26 --> 2359.26]  Amen
[2359.26 --> 2362.24]  And now to you
[2362.24 --> 2363.12]  Congregation
[2363.12 --> 2364.40]  I invite you also
[2364.40 --> 2365.86]  To respond
[2365.86 --> 2366.66]  If in fact
[2366.66 --> 2367.48]  You do agree
[2367.48 --> 2368.28]  By saying
[2368.28 --> 2369.22]  We do
[2369.22 --> 2370.66]  God helping us
[2370.66 --> 2372.26]  Do you
[2372.26 --> 2373.96]  The people of God
[2373.96 --> 2374.90]  Promise
[2374.90 --> 2375.64]  Hadassah
[2375.64 --> 2376.38]  Jared
[2376.38 --> 2377.14]  And Noah
[2377.14 --> 2378.26]  Your love
[2378.26 --> 2379.32]  Encouragement
[2379.32 --> 2380.34]  And prayers
[2380.34 --> 2384.44]  Amen
[2384.44 --> 2385.52]  At this point
[2385.52 --> 2386.18]  I'm going to invite
[2386.18 --> 2387.26]  Elder Frank
[2387.26 --> 2388.04]  To come forward
[2388.04 --> 2389.00]  He's going to present you
[2389.00 --> 2389.76]  With certificates
[2389.76 --> 2391.36]  And a gift
[2391.36 --> 2420.64]  Frank you might as well
[2420.64 --> 2421.30]  Stay up here
[2421.30 --> 2423.04]  As an elder
[2423.04 --> 2424.44]  I'm going to ask you guys
[2424.44 --> 2425.60]  Just to spread a little bit
[2425.60 --> 2427.26]  So take a step to your sides
[2427.26 --> 2428.56]  Jared you can stay right in the middle
[2428.56 --> 2429.52]  At this point
[2429.52 --> 2430.74]  We're going to pray over them
[2430.74 --> 2431.64]  And to do that
[2431.64 --> 2432.60]  I'm going to invite
[2432.60 --> 2433.74]  Their families
[2433.74 --> 2434.96]  And their spiritual mentors
[2434.96 --> 2435.58]  To come up
[2435.58 --> 2437.04]  And to surround them in prayer
[2437.04 --> 2439.10]  And I'm also going to invite
[2439.10 --> 2440.68]  The elders of the church
[2440.68 --> 2442.16]  To make their way forward
[2442.16 --> 2444.00]  And we're going to lay hands on them
[2444.00 --> 2445.52]  The elders come up
[2445.52 --> 2446.36]  On your behalf
[2446.36 --> 2447.84]  Representing all of us
[2447.84 --> 2449.30]  If you are remaining seated
[2449.30 --> 2450.02]  I encourage you
[2450.02 --> 2451.06]  You can hold your hand out
[2451.06 --> 2453.06]  As we pray over them as well
[2453.06 --> 2453.60]  So why don't you
[2453.60 --> 2455.50]  Make your way up to the front
[2455.50 --> 2456.76]  You guys might need to spread
[2456.76 --> 2457.56]  A little further
[2457.56 --> 2459.38]  Because there are large groups
[2459.38 --> 2460.44]  That are about to be up here
[2460.44 --> 2471.62]  And I'm going to Marquee
[2471.62 --> 2473.60]  I think there are large groups
[2473.60 --> 2492.94]  I think we are all up, and I think we might even all be in frame.
[2493.06 --> 2494.60]  Good job squeezing in on the sides.
[2496.72 --> 2499.42]  Let's pray over these people together.
[2499.42 --> 2512.26]  Lord, our God, we thank you for your word and spirit through which we know Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.
[2513.86 --> 2524.78]  Today, may Jared, Noah, and Hadassah, who confessed your name, never cease to wonder at what you have done for them.
[2524.78 --> 2533.92]  Help them to continue firmly in their faith, to bear witness to your love, and to let the Holy Spirit shape their lives.
[2534.90 --> 2541.24]  When they have questions and doubts, bring people into their path to provide answers.
[2541.24 --> 2547.96]  When they have joys and celebrations, bring people into their midst to share in those.
[2549.50 --> 2556.80]  Take them, good shepherd, into your care, that they may loyally endure opposition in serving you.
[2558.24 --> 2564.40]  And may we, with all your children, live together in the joy and power of your Holy Spirit.
[2564.40 --> 2568.56]  We ask this, Lord Jesus, in the hope of your coming.
[2569.02 --> 2572.00]  Come quickly, we pray, in Jesus' name.
[2572.52 --> 2574.80]  All God's people said, Amen.
[2574.80 --> 2574.94]  Amen.
[2574.94 --> 2577.06]  Amen.
[2577.06 --> 2577.14]  Amen.
[2594.40 --> 2600.94]  So we asked these three what song they would like to pick for this service, and one of them chose Cornerstone.
[2601.68 --> 2605.14]  Now, I know we sang this song last week, but we talked about it this morning,
[2605.14 --> 2608.78]  and we thought it's very fitting that we sang it last week with three baptisms,
[2609.30 --> 2611.94]  and now we're singing it again with three professions of faith.
[2612.52 --> 2613.98]  Please stand as we sing together.
[2613.98 --> 2614.12]  Amen.
[2614.12 --> 2614.32]  Amen.
[2614.32 --> 2615.22]  Amen.
[2615.22 --> 2615.74]  Amen.
[2615.74 --> 2616.24]  Amen.
[2616.24 --> 2616.28]  Amen.
[2616.28 --> 2616.46]  Amen.
[2616.46 --> 2617.22]  Amen.
[2617.22 --> 2617.46]  Amen.
[2617.46 --> 2617.50]  Amen.
[2617.50 --> 2617.98]  Amen.
[2617.98 --> 2618.42]  Amen.
[2618.42 --> 2619.02]  Amen.
[2619.02 --> 2619.50]  Amen.
[2624.40 --> 2632.88]  Amen.
[2633.40 --> 2633.94]  Amen.
[2633.94 --> 2644.38]  My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[2646.54 --> 2647.16]  Amen.
[2647.16 --> 2652.32]  I dare not trust the sweetest frame.
[2652.32 --> 2658.98]  But wholly trust in Jesus' name
[2658.98 --> 2669.56]  My hope is built on nothing less
[2669.56 --> 2673.92]  Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
[2673.92 --> 2681.92]  I dare not trust the sweetest praise
[2681.92 --> 2688.64]  But wholly trust in Jesus' name
[2688.64 --> 2696.92]  Christ alone, cornerstone
[2696.92 --> 2704.16]  Weak made strong in the Savior's love
[2704.16 --> 2710.74]  Through the storm, He is Lord
[2710.74 --> 2715.46]  Lord of all
[2715.46 --> 2725.72]  When darkness seems to hide His face
[2725.72 --> 2731.46]  I rest on His unchanging grace
[2731.46 --> 2738.18]  In every high and stormy gale
[2738.18 --> 2745.18]  My anchor holds within the veil
[2745.18 --> 2751.90]  My anchor holds within the veil
[2751.90 --> 2758.62]  Christ alone, cornerstone
[2758.62 --> 2766.08]  Weak made strong in the Savior's love
[2766.08 --> 2772.68]  Through the storm, He is Lord
[2772.68 --> 2777.40]  Lord of all
[2777.40 --> 2787.12]  When He shall come with trumpet sound
[2787.12 --> 2793.12]  Oh, may I then in Him be found
[2793.12 --> 2799.84]  Dressed in His righteousness alone
[2799.84 --> 2805.84]  Faultless stand before the throne
[2805.84 --> 2807.64]  God of all
[2807.64 --> 2824.56]  Who stroll Stators
[2824.56 --> 2854.54]  Thank you.
[2854.56 --> 2884.54]  Thank you.
[2884.56 --> 2896.20]  Christ alone, cornerstone, weak made strong in the Savior's love.
[2896.60 --> 2905.56]  Through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all.
[2905.56 --> 2919.64]  You may have a seat.
[2919.64 --> 2927.36]  I would, wow!
[2927.86 --> 2929.94]  I forget how loud my voice is sometimes.
[2930.14 --> 2933.10]  I would love to invite the kids to come forward.
[2933.58 --> 2938.28]  And we are going to sit here for a second and then pray, and then it's time for children's worship time.
[2938.28 --> 2941.94]  So if any kids want to come forward right now, that would be awesome.
[2945.82 --> 2946.68]  Here we go.
[2946.74 --> 2947.42]  Here comes some.
[2947.42 --> 2953.86]  Hi, everyone.
[2957.38 --> 2958.98]  It's good to see you all today.
[2959.08 --> 2959.54]  How's it going?
[2960.42 --> 2960.82]  Yeah?
[2960.82 --> 2964.70]  All right.
[2966.30 --> 2972.46]  So we're going to, I'm going to pray, and then you're going to head off to children's worship time after, but we're going to do the kids' blessing.
[2972.58 --> 2974.16]  Do you remember how the kids' blessing goes?
[2975.02 --> 2975.28]  No?
[2975.38 --> 2983.82]  We're going to say, we're going to, I'm going to pray first, and then we're going to stand, and we're going to put our hands up like this, and we're going to look at the church, and we're going to say, the Lord be with you.
[2983.82 --> 2985.46]  And then they're going to say it back to us, okay?
[2985.64 --> 2986.76]  Do you think we can do that after?
[2987.30 --> 2987.92]  I think so, too.
[2988.00 --> 2989.78]  Okay, let me pray, and then we'll try that, okay?
[2991.36 --> 2993.46]  Dear God, we thank you so much for this day.
[2993.64 --> 2999.48]  Thank you that we could come to church, that we could sing again, that we could be a part of this covenant family.
[2999.78 --> 3003.30]  Thank you for these kids who are going to go off to children's worship time.
[3003.40 --> 3007.86]  Thank you that they are here as well, and they will learn more about what it means to be a follower of you.
[3008.42 --> 3012.98]  Be with them in this time as well, and be with all of us who are staying behind and are learning the same thing.
[3012.98 --> 3014.40]  We pray this in your name.
[3014.86 --> 3015.18]  Amen.
[3015.60 --> 3016.66]  Okay, so let's stand up.
[3017.18 --> 3017.98]  Let's stand up.
[3018.34 --> 3019.24]  Let's turn around.
[3019.38 --> 3021.82]  The church is going to stand up, too, because they're really good at this.
[3022.84 --> 3024.88]  And now we're going to do this with our hands, all right?
[3024.92 --> 3028.98]  You're going to put your hands up, and then I'm going to go one, two, three, and we're going to say, the Lord be with you.
[3029.02 --> 3029.44]  Are you ready?
[3030.14 --> 3031.92]  One, two, three.
[3032.42 --> 3033.98]  The Lord be with you.
[3034.98 --> 3041.78]  All right, you guys can head to children's worship time if you're kindergarten or younger, I think.
[3042.98 --> 3046.78]  Gee, one, two.
[3061.40 --> 3061.94]  There we go.
[3061.94 --> 3073.06]  Today's offerings are for our church ministries and missions and for Night Shift, a not-for-profit
[3073.06 --> 3079.98]  society that has more than 2,500 volunteers, including community groups and church teams.
[3079.98 --> 3085.42]  Nightly outreach happens 365 days a year outside their offices in Wall-E.
[3085.42 --> 3091.76]  They offer meals, clothing, crisis counseling, basic nursing, and mobile library and loving
[3091.76 --> 3093.44]  community contact.
[3093.44 --> 3098.38]  Unless otherwise marked, all donations will go to Night Shift.
[3098.38 --> 3098.52]  Thank you.
[3115.42 --> 3145.40]  Thank you.
[3145.42 --> 3175.40]  Thank you.
[3175.42 --> 3177.42]  Thank you.
[3177.42 --> 3182.42]  Thank you.
[3182.42 --> 3184.42]  Thank you.
[3184.42 --> 3188.42]  Thank you.
[3188.42 --> 3195.42]  Thank you.
[3195.42 --> 3197.42]  Thank you.
[3197.42 --> 3199.42]  Thank you.
[3199.42 --> 3208.42]  Thank you.
[3208.42 --> 3210.42]  Thank you.
[3210.42 --> 3212.42]  Thank you.
[3212.42 --> 3214.42]  Thank you.
[3214.42 --> 3233.42]  Thank you.
[3233.42 --> 3263.40]  Thank you.
[3263.42 --> 3293.40]  Thank you.
[3294.38 --> 3295.28]  Good morning.
[3296.86 --> 3299.84]  I would like to lead you in church family prayer.
[3304.12 --> 3308.48]  Gracious Father, we come to you on this awesome summer morning.
[3308.48 --> 3311.50]  We thank you for this new day.
[3312.74 --> 3316.96]  A day of worship, rest, fellowship and reflection.
[3318.76 --> 3323.26]  As each one of us arose this morning, we are in different states of minds.
[3323.26 --> 3325.12]  Some are thankful.
[3325.72 --> 3326.56]  Some are worried.
[3327.80 --> 3337.38]  Some are dealing with the passing of family, health issues, job situations, chronic pains, relationship struggles.
[3337.38 --> 3346.10]  In all these situations, help us to remember your promises from Psalm 100, where it says,
[3346.10 --> 3349.56]  Know that the Lord is good, is God.
[3350.32 --> 3353.06]  It is he who made us, and we are his.
[3354.12 --> 3357.00]  We are his people, the sheep of his pasture.
[3358.28 --> 3361.78]  Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise.
[3361.78 --> 3365.84]  Give thanks to him and praise his name.
[3367.36 --> 3370.14]  For the Lord is good, and his love endures forever.
[3371.34 --> 3374.42]  His faithfulness continues through all generations.
[3374.42 --> 3382.56]  We thank you, Father, for these words, as they can give us comfort and support in every aspect of our lives.
[3384.80 --> 3387.08]  Dear Lord, we pray for the Miles family.
[3388.02 --> 3394.34]  Be with Willie and Joanne and their children, as they had a memorial service for the passing of their son Mike this past week.
[3395.92 --> 3397.20]  Be with Mike's family.
[3397.42 --> 3401.10]  Keep them in your care, Lord, as now they go through life without an earthly father.
[3401.10 --> 3406.00]  Also be with Willie, as he is dealing with ongoing health concerns.
[3407.12 --> 3409.64]  Father, grant healing and strength for him as well.
[3411.66 --> 3415.10]  Lord, we bring before you Bob Viss, who is having treatments for cancer.
[3416.42 --> 3418.64]  Give Bob all he needs to deal with these treatments.
[3419.10 --> 3421.62]  And Lord, grant his health to be restored.
[3423.28 --> 3428.48]  Also be with Louise and their children, as they help and support Bob and process this health concern.
[3428.48 --> 3432.76]  Surround them with your spirit as they walk this road.
[3434.52 --> 3438.12]  Also be with Benita Smid as she recovers from a mild heart attack.
[3439.16 --> 3440.12]  Restore her strength.
[3440.64 --> 3443.26]  Thank you, Father, for everything you have already provided.
[3445.24 --> 3449.48]  Father, we pray for the Murad family and the Iraqi Christian community in Surrey,
[3449.80 --> 3452.82]  who lost their place of worship due to a fire this past week.
[3452.82 --> 3457.86]  Give them everything they need to move forward from this experience.
[3459.38 --> 3464.04]  We ask for a stop to the burning of places of worship that is happening all over Canada.
[3465.12 --> 3468.54]  We ask you, Lord, to put an end to all the forest fires as well.
[3469.66 --> 3473.80]  May we get a reprieve of all this dry weather and get some rain to help.
[3474.48 --> 3476.82]  Give the firefighters all the support they need.
[3476.82 --> 3481.64]  We pray for all who have lost homes, businesses, and lives.
[3482.90 --> 3484.94]  Lord, care and restore them.
[3486.44 --> 3491.12]  Also give us the desire and the means to support them in any way we can.
[3492.68 --> 3497.66]  Be with our farming communities who so desperately need rain for their crops and livestock.
[3498.42 --> 3499.22]  Give what is needed.
[3501.46 --> 3505.52]  Lord, we pray for everyone who is still dealing with the COVID situation.
[3505.52 --> 3512.98]  Whether it is job loss, shut-ins, stress, anxiety, inability to see family or travel.
[3514.98 --> 3518.38]  Lord, we ask for an end to all these situations.
[3520.20 --> 3523.32]  There are those whose names we have not mentioned here today,
[3523.66 --> 3527.48]  but we know they are having struggles in life,
[3528.04 --> 3529.94]  which we bring before you.
[3529.94 --> 3533.74]  Father, you know their pain and problems.
[3534.60 --> 3538.98]  Grant healing, strength, and support for these children of yours as well.
[3545.04 --> 3547.70]  Father, there is also a lot to be thankful for.
[3549.18 --> 3552.18]  We see your many blessings all around us.
[3552.18 --> 3557.50]  There are healthy children being born, youth professing their faith.
[3558.36 --> 3559.26]  Marriage is happening.
[3561.32 --> 3563.60]  Lord, we pray for Dave and Sheila Skipper,
[3564.64 --> 3567.32]  who are blessed with a healthy baby boy.
[3569.08 --> 3573.90]  Grant Sheila and Dave, everything they need as parents to raise their son, Dawson.
[3573.90 --> 3579.52]  Lord, we think of all the seniors here in our midst.
[3580.58 --> 3585.04]  We are thankful for their gifts that they are still using in this community
[3585.04 --> 3591.30]  with joy, happiness, enthusiasm to support and care for each other.
[3591.30 --> 3596.72]  We know there are limitations in their lives,
[3597.40 --> 3601.64]  but they do not let it stop them from doing their part.
[3602.76 --> 3604.96]  Be near to them with their struggles in life
[3604.96 --> 3608.20]  and give them freedom for these things.
[3610.28 --> 3613.92]  Lord, bless all the care providers for our seniors as well.
[3614.96 --> 3617.02]  Support their abilities and gifts.
[3617.02 --> 3622.58]  We also pray, Father, for all the volunteers, staff members,
[3623.18 --> 3626.36]  all those who work behind the scenes here at Emmanuel.
[3627.44 --> 3629.94]  Bless their efforts and walk with them.
[3631.78 --> 3634.16]  We thank you that you were able to share,
[3634.52 --> 3637.10]  we thank you that we are able to share and witness
[3637.10 --> 3641.76]  the profession of faith of Hadassah, Noah, and Jared this morning.
[3643.76 --> 3645.14]  Be with these youth, Lord.
[3645.14 --> 3648.92]  Give each one of them a strong commitment to walk the life
[3648.92 --> 3651.10]  in the understanding of you
[3651.10 --> 3654.28]  and reflect it for the rest of their earthly lives.
[3656.76 --> 3658.58]  Bless the offerings of today, Lord.
[3659.60 --> 3660.90]  Help with night shift ministry.
[3661.84 --> 3663.86]  Bless the volunteers who do this great work
[3663.86 --> 3665.52]  of looking after those on the street.
[3666.62 --> 3668.28]  Again, bless this ministry.
[3669.88 --> 3672.14]  We also pray for the continuing support
[3672.14 --> 3673.80]  for the operations of this church.
[3673.80 --> 3679.42]  Let each member here recognize their responsibility in this
[3679.42 --> 3681.36]  and support it accordingly.
[3682.76 --> 3685.38]  We ask for a blessing for the preaching of your word
[3685.38 --> 3686.92]  as we wrestle with the question,
[3687.62 --> 3688.34]  what is truth?
[3689.48 --> 3691.68]  Let us get a clear understanding of this question
[3691.68 --> 3694.08]  and walk with it in our lives.
[3695.20 --> 3697.94]  We close with these words from Psalm 107.
[3697.94 --> 3701.66]  Give thanks to the Lord always, for he is good
[3701.66 --> 3703.56]  and his love is forever.
[3703.56 --> 3704.60]  Amen.
[3704.60 --> 3729.34]  If you have a Bible in your hands or handy
[3729.34 --> 3731.78]  or on a device of the sort,
[3731.78 --> 3735.40]  we're going to read from two places this morning.
[3735.56 --> 3737.46]  And so we're going to read from John 4.
[3738.66 --> 3740.82]  If you want to find that.
[3741.00 --> 3743.90]  And then we're also going to read from John 8.
[3744.46 --> 3746.74]  And so that's obviously just a couple chapters over.
[3746.98 --> 3747.70]  You can grab that.
[3748.78 --> 3751.92]  I'm going to read both of those texts before we jump in.
[3751.92 --> 3755.18]  So starting in John 4, I'm going to read beginning at verse 19
[3755.18 --> 3758.54]  and then carry it through to 26.
[3760.60 --> 3764.74]  Jesus has entered into the region of Samaria
[3764.74 --> 3769.14]  and he, walking with his disciples, comes upon a well.
[3769.30 --> 3770.14]  It is midday.
[3770.28 --> 3770.96]  It is noon.
[3771.52 --> 3773.34]  The sun is hot overhead
[3773.34 --> 3776.00]  and there is a woman there gathering water.
[3776.20 --> 3778.12]  And Jesus begins this really beautiful
[3778.12 --> 3780.54]  and profound exchange with her.
[3780.92 --> 3783.18]  We jump into the middle of that exchange.
[3784.58 --> 3787.12]  Sir, talking to Jesus, the woman said,
[3787.94 --> 3790.16]  I can see that you are a prophet.
[3791.20 --> 3793.68]  Our ancestors worshipped on this mountain,
[3793.88 --> 3796.56]  but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship
[3796.56 --> 3797.92]  is in Jerusalem.
[3799.08 --> 3800.96]  Woman, Jesus replied,
[3800.96 --> 3804.82]  Believe me, a time is coming
[3804.82 --> 3806.68]  when you will worship the Father
[3806.68 --> 3809.26]  neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.
[3810.40 --> 3812.84]  You Samaritans worship what you do not know.
[3813.34 --> 3815.18]  We worship what we do know,
[3815.42 --> 3817.24]  for salvation is from the Jews.
[3818.22 --> 3821.08]  Yet a time is coming and has now come
[3821.08 --> 3823.88]  when true worshippers will worship the Father
[3823.88 --> 3826.62]  in the spirit and in truth.
[3827.52 --> 3830.50]  For they are the kind of worshippers the Father seeks.
[3830.96 --> 3833.34]  God is spirit
[3833.34 --> 3836.12]  and his worshippers must worship
[3836.12 --> 3839.08]  in the spirit and in truth.
[3840.52 --> 3841.78]  The woman said,
[3842.88 --> 3846.02]  I know that Messiah, called Christ, is coming.
[3846.70 --> 3849.72]  And when he comes, he will explain everything to us.
[3850.76 --> 3852.08]  Then Jesus declared,
[3852.76 --> 3855.86]  I, the one speaking to you, am he.
[3855.86 --> 3860.74]  Then if you jump over to John 8.
[3863.18 --> 3866.24]  John 8, we'll start at verse 31
[3866.24 --> 3873.12]  and read through a little longer this time to 47.
[3873.12 --> 3877.82]  So Jesus is speaking to the crowds
[3877.82 --> 3879.14]  and assembled among the crowds
[3879.14 --> 3882.94]  are leaders, teachers, Pharisees of the law.
[3882.94 --> 3887.38]  To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said,
[3888.16 --> 3892.32]  If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.
[3893.32 --> 3894.56]  And then you will know the truth,
[3894.82 --> 3897.36]  and the truth will set you free.
[3898.82 --> 3899.86]  They answered him,
[3899.86 --> 3902.52]  We are Abraham's descendants
[3902.52 --> 3904.62]  and have never been slaves of anyone.
[3905.02 --> 3907.60]  How can you say that we shall be set free?
[3909.08 --> 3910.08]  Jesus replied,
[3910.24 --> 3912.52]  Very truly, I tell you,
[3913.06 --> 3915.90]  everyone who sins is a slave to sin.
[3916.80 --> 3919.32]  Now a slave has no permanent place in the family,
[3919.48 --> 3921.96]  but a son belongs to it forever.
[3922.72 --> 3924.68]  So if the son sets you free,
[3924.94 --> 3926.40]  you will be free indeed.
[3926.40 --> 3929.96]  I know that you are Abraham's descendants,
[3930.24 --> 3932.26]  yet you are looking for a way to kill me
[3932.26 --> 3934.52]  because you have no room for my word.
[3935.40 --> 3937.40]  I am telling you what I have seen
[3937.40 --> 3938.36]  in the Father's presence,
[3938.56 --> 3940.66]  and you are doing what you have heard
[3940.66 --> 3941.64]  from your father.
[3942.78 --> 3945.08]  Abraham is our father, they answered.
[3946.00 --> 3948.92]  If you were Abraham's children, said Jesus,
[3949.16 --> 3951.54]  then you would do what Abraham did.
[3951.94 --> 3955.06]  As it is, you are looking for a way to kill me,
[3955.06 --> 3957.24]  a man who has told you the truth
[3957.24 --> 3958.44]  that I heard from God.
[3958.90 --> 3960.92]  Abraham did not do such things.
[3961.18 --> 3963.94]  You are doing the works of your own father.
[3964.94 --> 3966.90]  We are not illegitimate children,
[3967.04 --> 3967.84]  they protested.
[3968.06 --> 3970.60]  The only father we have is God himself.
[3972.96 --> 3973.96]  Then Jesus said,
[3975.62 --> 3978.00]  If God were your father,
[3978.72 --> 3980.86]  you would love me,
[3981.42 --> 3984.12]  for I have come from God.
[3984.12 --> 3987.88]  I have not come on my own.
[3988.44 --> 3989.66]  God sent me.
[3990.40 --> 3992.26]  Which is why my language,
[3992.66 --> 3994.78]  why is my language not clear to you?
[3995.08 --> 3997.48]  Because you are unable to hear what I say.
[3997.84 --> 4000.40]  You belong to your father, the devil,
[4000.96 --> 4003.66]  and you want to carry out your father's desires.
[4004.78 --> 4006.78]  He was a murderer from the beginning,
[4006.94 --> 4008.18]  not holding to the truth.
[4008.30 --> 4010.36]  There is no truth in him.
[4010.58 --> 4013.12]  When he lies, he speaks his native language,
[4013.12 --> 4015.98]  for he is a liar and the father of lies.
[4016.66 --> 4019.54]  Yet, because I tell the truth,
[4019.74 --> 4021.02]  you do not believe me.
[4021.66 --> 4024.08]  Can any of you prove me guilty of sin?
[4024.64 --> 4026.04]  If I am telling the truth,
[4026.14 --> 4027.30]  why don't you believe me?
[4028.14 --> 4029.70]  Whoever belongs to God,
[4029.84 --> 4031.14]  hears what God says.
[4031.50 --> 4033.40]  The reason you do not hear
[4033.40 --> 4037.26]  is that you do not belong to God.
[4037.26 --> 4039.24]  This is the word of the Lord.
[4045.42 --> 4051.18]  Part of the purpose of our series this summer,
[4051.42 --> 4052.24]  Ask Anything,
[4053.00 --> 4058.66]  is to show that asking hard questions is good.
[4058.66 --> 4062.38]  Another purpose in this series
[4062.38 --> 4065.28]  is to also model for you
[4065.28 --> 4068.30]  how to answer those kinds of questions.
[4068.76 --> 4069.12]  And hopefully,
[4069.28 --> 4071.66]  so that you can take the model or the method
[4071.66 --> 4073.66]  and bring it home.
[4074.64 --> 4076.10]  And so to answer the question
[4076.10 --> 4078.86]  that was submitted to us for today,
[4079.08 --> 4080.96]  I'm going to do two things.
[4081.04 --> 4082.42]  And it's a little bit different.
[4083.04 --> 4085.12]  And so I'm going to ask for your patience
[4085.12 --> 4087.44]  and understanding as we go into it.
[4087.44 --> 4088.08]  So first,
[4088.20 --> 4089.78]  I am going to answer the question,
[4090.66 --> 4092.26]  but I'm going to do that
[4092.26 --> 4094.22]  by teaching you
[4094.22 --> 4097.86]  the way that I do Bible studies.
[4099.00 --> 4099.12]  All right,
[4099.14 --> 4100.28]  so not just are you going to get
[4100.28 --> 4101.28]  a particular answer
[4101.28 --> 4103.18]  to this particular question,
[4103.18 --> 4105.26]  but by zooming out just a little bit,
[4105.38 --> 4107.20]  we're going to talk about method.
[4108.36 --> 4109.84]  And so I'll show you the way
[4109.84 --> 4111.60]  to find answers
[4111.60 --> 4114.54]  to similar kinds of questions.
[4114.78 --> 4115.76]  And maybe then it's something
[4115.76 --> 4116.46]  that you can apply
[4116.46 --> 4117.68]  as you lead a Bible study
[4117.68 --> 4118.86]  in your home
[4118.86 --> 4119.82]  or with your care group
[4119.82 --> 4122.84]  or just in your own devotional life.
[4124.00 --> 4125.80]  And so using the answer
[4125.80 --> 4127.30]  to our question this morning,
[4127.30 --> 4128.72]  I will try to show you
[4128.72 --> 4130.72]  how to do the same for yourselves.
[4131.48 --> 4132.68]  Because the truth is,
[4132.94 --> 4134.56]  I know that a bunch of us
[4134.56 --> 4136.02]  struggle regularly
[4136.02 --> 4138.14]  with how to read the Bible well
[4138.14 --> 4140.70]  and how to understand the Bible
[4140.70 --> 4142.32]  for what the Bible is saying.
[4143.20 --> 4143.58]  Right?
[4143.58 --> 4144.18]  And you get what I mean
[4144.18 --> 4145.24]  when I make that distinction?
[4145.40 --> 4147.60]  Because it's really easy
[4147.60 --> 4149.38]  for us to sort of read
[4149.38 --> 4151.56]  our own feelings or ideas
[4151.56 --> 4152.98]  into a text of the Bible
[4152.98 --> 4154.26]  or a story in the Bible
[4154.26 --> 4157.08]  and not hear what the Bible
[4157.08 --> 4157.94]  is actually saying.
[4158.30 --> 4159.20]  And let me give you an example.
[4159.34 --> 4159.92]  Have you ever been
[4159.92 --> 4160.72]  in a Bible study
[4160.72 --> 4162.66]  or part of a group of people
[4162.66 --> 4164.42]  looking at a Bible text
[4164.42 --> 4165.76]  and someone says,
[4165.88 --> 4167.16]  well, I feel like it means this.
[4167.62 --> 4168.46]  And then someone says,
[4168.52 --> 4169.78]  well, I feel like it means this.
[4169.82 --> 4170.88]  And then a third person says,
[4170.92 --> 4172.20]  well, I feel like it means this.
[4172.20 --> 4173.46]  And then with the three people
[4173.46 --> 4174.30]  in your Bible study,
[4174.48 --> 4175.26]  half an hour later,
[4175.26 --> 4176.52]  you've got five different opinions
[4176.52 --> 4177.84]  about what it feels like it means
[4177.84 --> 4179.30]  and nobody goes home satisfied.
[4180.30 --> 4181.30]  Because we're just not sure.
[4185.14 --> 4188.48]  By the end of your Bible study,
[4188.92 --> 4190.88]  with the tips and tools
[4190.88 --> 4192.66]  of the method that I use
[4192.66 --> 4193.46]  and that I'm going to share it
[4193.46 --> 4193.98]  with you today,
[4194.32 --> 4196.50]  I hope you will be able to leave
[4196.50 --> 4198.58]  saying, you know,
[4198.62 --> 4199.68]  we really believe
[4199.68 --> 4201.20]  that it means this
[4201.20 --> 4202.04]  for this reason
[4202.04 --> 4202.64]  and this reason
[4202.64 --> 4203.32]  and this reason.
[4203.46 --> 4204.86]  And so we're going to go
[4204.86 --> 4205.90]  and do this
[4205.90 --> 4206.90]  or that
[4206.90 --> 4207.90]  or the other thing.
[4209.90 --> 4211.48]  And so in that method,
[4212.00 --> 4213.48]  the first step
[4213.48 --> 4216.02]  when I'm trying to figure out
[4216.02 --> 4217.54]  a text like this
[4217.54 --> 4218.88]  is what I call
[4218.88 --> 4220.20]  asking the question
[4220.20 --> 4222.20]  or querying the text.
[4222.56 --> 4223.16]  And I do this
[4223.16 --> 4224.38]  every time I sit down
[4224.38 --> 4226.06]  to prepare a sermon
[4226.06 --> 4227.32]  or teach a Bible study
[4227.32 --> 4228.26]  or the like.
[4228.36 --> 4229.64]  I read through the text
[4229.64 --> 4231.22]  and I query it.
[4231.34 --> 4232.44]  I ask questions.
[4232.58 --> 4233.88]  I step into the text
[4233.88 --> 4234.84]  and I write down
[4234.84 --> 4235.80]  any questions
[4235.80 --> 4237.22]  that come to mind.
[4238.06 --> 4238.18]  Right?
[4238.22 --> 4238.64]  And so maybe,
[4238.88 --> 4239.34]  for instance,
[4239.48 --> 4241.26]  it's the place names
[4241.26 --> 4242.22]  of certain cities
[4242.22 --> 4243.02]  or towns
[4243.02 --> 4243.92]  in the story
[4243.92 --> 4244.50]  that you're reading
[4244.50 --> 4245.00]  and you think,
[4245.10 --> 4246.08]  oh, I want to get a map
[4246.08 --> 4246.96]  and look at
[4246.96 --> 4248.10]  just how far is it
[4248.10 --> 4249.66]  that Jesus had to walk
[4249.66 --> 4250.54]  with his disciples
[4250.54 --> 4251.36]  as you're trying
[4251.36 --> 4252.84]  to understand a text.
[4252.92 --> 4253.88]  Maybe your question
[4253.88 --> 4255.50]  is about the last time
[4255.50 --> 4257.24]  someone asked Jesus a question
[4257.24 --> 4258.30]  and how did he answer
[4258.30 --> 4259.40]  in that situation
[4259.40 --> 4260.48]  and what's different
[4260.48 --> 4262.24]  about that sort of situation.
[4263.60 --> 4265.02]  Maybe you're stuck
[4265.02 --> 4266.74]  on a particular word
[4266.74 --> 4267.56]  or phrase
[4267.56 --> 4268.40]  that is repeated
[4268.40 --> 4269.48]  over and over,
[4269.86 --> 4270.72]  especially as you're reading
[4270.72 --> 4271.62]  something like the Psalms
[4271.62 --> 4272.24]  or the prophets
[4272.24 --> 4273.42]  and you're wondering,
[4273.64 --> 4274.52]  what is this phrase
[4274.52 --> 4275.16]  really about?
[4275.26 --> 4275.80]  Write it down.
[4277.12 --> 4277.26]  Right?
[4277.28 --> 4278.88]  Maybe you're reading the text
[4278.88 --> 4279.74]  and you're curious
[4279.74 --> 4281.54]  about the flood cycles
[4281.54 --> 4282.86]  of the Jordan River
[4282.86 --> 4283.80]  and you wonder,
[4283.96 --> 4285.00]  how might that affect
[4285.00 --> 4286.00]  the story
[4286.00 --> 4286.92]  of the people
[4286.92 --> 4288.04]  crossing the Jordan
[4288.04 --> 4288.84]  at Jericho
[4288.84 --> 4289.64]  before they entered
[4289.64 --> 4290.34]  the promised land
[4290.34 --> 4291.14]  for the first time
[4291.14 --> 4291.92]  and so you've got to
[4291.92 --> 4292.92]  do a little bit of research
[4292.92 --> 4294.44]  but write it down.
[4295.82 --> 4295.98]  Right?
[4296.02 --> 4297.08]  Maybe you're reading Exodus
[4297.08 --> 4298.12]  and you wonder,
[4298.40 --> 4299.34]  what's so special
[4299.34 --> 4301.58]  about Bezael
[4301.58 --> 4302.64]  and Aholiab?
[4304.44 --> 4305.96]  Whatever your question is,
[4306.48 --> 4307.08]  write it down.
[4307.88 --> 4308.46]  Ask it.
[4308.88 --> 4309.86]  Find what's interesting
[4309.86 --> 4311.00]  for you in that moment.
[4311.72 --> 4313.00]  Even the most inane questions
[4313.00 --> 4315.12]  are good at this point
[4315.12 --> 4315.96]  just to write down
[4315.96 --> 4317.34]  as you're engaging in them
[4317.34 --> 4319.36]  and then begin to work through
[4319.36 --> 4321.20]  your list of questions.
[4323.16 --> 4323.52]  And so,
[4324.04 --> 4326.18]  in our text,
[4326.52 --> 4327.90]  someone was reading
[4327.90 --> 4328.82]  their Bible at home
[4328.82 --> 4330.10]  and they had a question.
[4331.44 --> 4332.40]  When we ask a question
[4332.40 --> 4333.60]  of our text
[4333.60 --> 4335.24]  and the two that we read,
[4336.08 --> 4337.58]  Jesus in John 4
[4337.58 --> 4339.00]  says to the Samaritan woman,
[4339.00 --> 4340.08]  God is spirit
[4340.08 --> 4341.08]  and his worshipers
[4341.08 --> 4342.46]  must worship in the spirit
[4342.46 --> 4344.30]  and in truth.
[4345.24 --> 4345.74]  And the question
[4345.74 --> 4346.48]  that we were asked
[4346.48 --> 4347.82]  is how does this idea
[4347.82 --> 4349.08]  of truth relate
[4349.08 --> 4350.50]  to John 8
[4350.50 --> 4352.26]  in 31 to 47
[4352.26 --> 4353.26]  where Jesus speaks
[4353.26 --> 4354.56]  of knowing the truth
[4354.56 --> 4355.34]  and the truth
[4355.34 --> 4356.34]  will set you free.
[4356.74 --> 4357.34]  And then he makes
[4357.34 --> 4358.26]  a contrast between
[4358.26 --> 4360.04]  the truth that he speaks
[4360.04 --> 4361.06]  and the lies
[4361.06 --> 4362.78]  that the devil speaks.
[4363.10 --> 4364.30]  What is truth
[4364.30 --> 4366.16]  in those places?
[4366.16 --> 4368.06]  That's the question.
[4368.64 --> 4368.78]  Right?
[4368.84 --> 4370.58]  We've queried the text
[4370.58 --> 4371.70]  and that has set
[4371.70 --> 4372.32]  a direction
[4372.32 --> 4373.88]  for our understanding.
[4374.76 --> 4376.34]  I regularly tell people
[4376.34 --> 4377.04]  when you are reading
[4377.04 --> 4377.58]  the Bible,
[4378.34 --> 4379.24]  do it with a pen
[4379.24 --> 4380.44]  and a pencil.
[4381.22 --> 4382.38]  Write down your questions
[4382.38 --> 4383.30]  or the ideas
[4383.30 --> 4384.28]  that jump out to you.
[4384.40 --> 4385.80]  Ask questions.
[4386.26 --> 4387.44]  Query the text.
[4387.76 --> 4388.30]  And then
[4388.30 --> 4389.84]  we move to step two.
[4391.34 --> 4391.48]  Right?
[4391.56 --> 4392.22]  So step one
[4392.22 --> 4393.56]  is query the text.
[4394.00 --> 4394.88]  In step two,
[4394.88 --> 4396.84]  you ask your questions.
[4397.06 --> 4398.52]  You start answering them.
[4398.88 --> 4399.32]  That seems like
[4399.32 --> 4400.44]  a pretty obvious next step.
[4401.18 --> 4401.36]  Right?
[4401.46 --> 4402.06]  Here we are
[4402.06 --> 4403.84]  mining the text
[4403.84 --> 4405.06]  and exploring
[4405.06 --> 4406.08]  the context.
[4407.46 --> 4407.80]  And so
[4407.80 --> 4408.68]  does a verse
[4408.68 --> 4409.88]  later on
[4409.88 --> 4410.78]  in what you've read
[4410.78 --> 4411.60]  answer the question
[4411.60 --> 4412.00]  you have?
[4413.08 --> 4413.24]  Right?
[4413.28 --> 4414.22]  Does a story
[4414.22 --> 4415.30]  later on
[4415.30 --> 4416.46]  answer what was
[4416.46 --> 4417.26]  interesting to you
[4417.26 --> 4418.26]  as you read the first one?
[4418.58 --> 4419.82]  Does the same issue
[4419.82 --> 4421.06]  come up somewhere else
[4421.06 --> 4422.02]  in the Bible?
[4423.34 --> 4424.66]  Answer questions
[4424.66 --> 4425.88]  first by mining
[4425.88 --> 4426.54]  the text
[4426.54 --> 4427.10]  that is digging
[4427.10 --> 4428.08]  deep into the
[4428.08 --> 4429.00]  particular text
[4429.00 --> 4429.84]  and exploring
[4429.84 --> 4431.20]  the context.
[4432.52 --> 4433.22]  Now when I talk
[4433.22 --> 4433.90]  about exploring
[4433.90 --> 4434.42]  the context
[4434.42 --> 4434.92]  I do
[4434.92 --> 4436.26]  I mean two things.
[4437.26 --> 4437.40]  Right?
[4437.44 --> 4438.02]  What is the
[4438.02 --> 4438.94]  relationship
[4438.94 --> 4440.20]  of this verse
[4440.20 --> 4441.02]  or chapter
[4441.02 --> 4441.70]  or book
[4441.70 --> 4443.50]  that I'm reading
[4443.50 --> 4445.06]  to the whole?
[4445.30 --> 4445.46]  Right?
[4445.56 --> 4446.18]  To the whole
[4446.18 --> 4446.78]  of the book
[4446.78 --> 4447.34]  that it's in
[4447.34 --> 4447.94]  or to the rest
[4447.94 --> 4448.48]  of the chapter
[4448.48 --> 4449.60]  or to the whole
[4449.60 --> 4450.34]  of the New Testament
[4450.34 --> 4451.06]  or the Old Testament
[4451.06 --> 4451.88]  or to the whole Bible?
[4451.88 --> 4454.64]  Also
[4454.64 --> 4455.64]  when we are
[4455.64 --> 4457.60]  exploring the context
[4457.60 --> 4458.18]  I mean
[4458.18 --> 4458.86]  what is the
[4458.86 --> 4460.38]  historical context
[4460.38 --> 4461.30]  into which
[4461.30 --> 4462.28]  this was written
[4462.28 --> 4463.02]  or whatever
[4463.02 --> 4464.72]  this is addressing?
[4465.10 --> 4465.90]  Because it can be
[4465.90 --> 4466.60]  really easy
[4466.60 --> 4467.42]  for us to forget
[4467.42 --> 4468.00]  that the Bible
[4468.00 --> 4468.42]  was written
[4468.42 --> 4468.90]  to a people
[4468.90 --> 4469.82]  of a different culture
[4469.82 --> 4470.70]  at a completely
[4470.70 --> 4471.34]  different time
[4471.34 --> 4472.26]  in history.
[4472.78 --> 4473.06]  And in fact
[4473.06 --> 4473.64]  one of the
[4473.64 --> 4474.82]  beautiful aspects
[4474.82 --> 4475.78]  of Christianity
[4475.78 --> 4476.82]  is that it is
[4476.82 --> 4478.66]  historically situated.
[4478.94 --> 4479.00]  Right?
[4479.00 --> 4480.56]  The Bible records
[4480.56 --> 4482.34]  events that actually
[4482.34 --> 4483.62]  happened in the past.
[4484.84 --> 4486.24]  But that also means
[4486.24 --> 4487.48]  we should understand
[4487.48 --> 4488.12]  something about
[4488.12 --> 4489.80]  the time and place
[4489.80 --> 4490.76]  of the past
[4490.76 --> 4492.04]  in order to make sure
[4492.04 --> 4492.58]  that we are
[4492.58 --> 4493.68]  reading the text
[4493.68 --> 4494.46]  for what the text
[4494.46 --> 4495.80]  means to say.
[4496.56 --> 4497.08]  And so here
[4497.08 --> 4497.82]  you might need
[4497.82 --> 4498.78]  some good resources.
[4499.30 --> 4499.40]  Right?
[4499.46 --> 4500.24]  Some good books
[4500.24 --> 4501.58]  or some trusted websites
[4501.58 --> 4502.90]  or commentaries.
[4504.44 --> 4505.68]  Now let's practice that.
[4506.32 --> 4507.40]  For our question
[4507.40 --> 4508.80]  the way that we can
[4508.80 --> 4509.76]  mine the text
[4509.76 --> 4511.24]  and explore the context
[4511.24 --> 4513.18]  is to look at how
[4513.18 --> 4514.94]  John uses the word
[4514.94 --> 4516.48]  truth throughout
[4516.48 --> 4517.24]  his gospel.
[4518.48 --> 4519.26]  Now here a good
[4519.26 --> 4520.22]  Bible concordance
[4520.22 --> 4520.90]  will help you
[4520.90 --> 4522.04]  or an online Bible
[4522.04 --> 4522.96]  or a Bible app.
[4523.38 --> 4524.60]  I use Bible Gateway
[4524.60 --> 4525.54]  all the time.
[4525.54 --> 4526.22]  On my phone
[4526.22 --> 4527.04]  I have the NIV
[4527.04 --> 4528.00]  Study Bible app
[4528.00 --> 4528.70]  from Zondervan
[4528.70 --> 4529.52]  and the ESV
[4529.52 --> 4530.54]  Gospel Transformation
[4530.54 --> 4531.18]  Study Bible
[4531.18 --> 4532.46]  from Crossway.
[4532.58 --> 4533.36]  Both are searchable.
[4533.48 --> 4534.28]  Both are really good.
[4534.80 --> 4535.56]  If you're feeling
[4535.56 --> 4536.66]  particularly keen
[4536.66 --> 4537.36]  and you want to search
[4537.36 --> 4538.26]  the original Hebrew
[4538.26 --> 4538.66]  and Greek
[4538.66 --> 4539.56]  I can also give you
[4539.56 --> 4540.66]  websites to do that
[4540.66 --> 4541.16]  and show you
[4541.16 --> 4541.78]  how to use it.
[4542.48 --> 4543.50]  In our case
[4543.50 --> 4544.08]  this morning
[4544.08 --> 4545.16]  we're looking at
[4545.16 --> 4545.94]  the word truth
[4545.94 --> 4547.26]  and so we mine
[4547.26 --> 4547.96]  the text
[4547.96 --> 4550.08]  for the word truth.
[4550.22 --> 4551.04]  How does John
[4551.04 --> 4552.22]  use the word truth
[4552.22 --> 4553.16]  or aletheia
[4553.16 --> 4553.90]  in Greek
[4553.90 --> 4555.10]  in his gospel?
[4555.98 --> 4556.30]  And so I'm going
[4556.30 --> 4556.96]  to do a real quick
[4556.96 --> 4558.24]  survey with you
[4558.24 --> 4558.74]  of a couple
[4558.74 --> 4559.90]  major places
[4559.90 --> 4560.52]  they will be on
[4560.52 --> 4561.42]  the screen overhead
[4561.42 --> 4562.62]  so you can write
[4562.62 --> 4563.02]  them down
[4563.02 --> 4564.06]  and check it later.
[4564.06 --> 4566.08]  The first use
[4566.08 --> 4567.46]  of the word truth
[4567.46 --> 4569.68]  is in John 1.14
[4569.68 --> 4572.10]  The word became flesh
[4572.10 --> 4573.28]  and made his dwelling
[4573.28 --> 4574.60]  among us.
[4575.26 --> 4576.38]  We have seen his glory
[4576.38 --> 4577.52]  the glory of the one
[4577.52 --> 4578.42]  and only son
[4578.42 --> 4579.84]  who came from the father
[4579.84 --> 4580.96]  full of grace
[4580.96 --> 4583.14]  and truth.
[4584.94 --> 4585.56]  So here
[4585.56 --> 4586.26]  truth
[4586.26 --> 4587.68]  seems to be
[4587.68 --> 4588.46]  an attribute
[4588.46 --> 4589.92]  a description
[4589.92 --> 4590.92]  of Jesus'
[4591.76 --> 4592.12]  character.
[4592.12 --> 4593.80]  And then we work
[4593.80 --> 4594.18]  our way through
[4594.18 --> 4595.06]  the gospel of John
[4595.06 --> 4596.26]  you get John 4
[4596.26 --> 4597.34]  and John 8
[4597.34 --> 4599.28]  where we read
[4599.28 --> 4600.18]  and found that word
[4600.18 --> 4602.18]  then you get to one
[4602.18 --> 4602.90]  that many of you
[4602.90 --> 4603.60]  might know
[4603.60 --> 4604.58]  Jesus says
[4604.58 --> 4606.06]  I am the way
[4606.06 --> 4607.36]  the truth
[4607.36 --> 4608.46]  and the life
[4608.46 --> 4609.24]  no one comes
[4609.24 --> 4609.82]  to the father
[4609.82 --> 4610.82]  except through me
[4610.82 --> 4612.72]  and then in the rest
[4612.72 --> 4613.48]  of John 14
[4613.48 --> 4614.22]  and then through
[4614.22 --> 4615.00]  John 16
[4615.00 --> 4615.96]  Jesus talks about
[4615.96 --> 4616.36]  the coming
[4616.36 --> 4617.20]  of the Holy Spirit
[4617.20 --> 4617.76]  and he calls
[4617.76 --> 4618.48]  the Holy Spirit
[4618.48 --> 4620.48]  the spirit of truth
[4620.48 --> 4621.40]  and he talks about
[4621.40 --> 4622.66]  knowing the spirit
[4622.66 --> 4623.90]  of truth
[4623.90 --> 4626.00]  and then in John 17
[4626.00 --> 4627.22]  and importantly
[4627.22 --> 4628.26]  I think for our
[4628.26 --> 4629.72]  discussion this morning
[4629.72 --> 4630.84]  Jesus prays
[4630.84 --> 4631.80]  what we've come to call
[4631.80 --> 4632.94]  the high priestly
[4632.94 --> 4633.86]  prayer
[4633.86 --> 4634.44]  and it's called
[4634.44 --> 4635.66]  the high priestly prayer
[4635.66 --> 4636.58]  because Jesus is
[4636.58 --> 4637.96]  making intercession
[4637.96 --> 4638.80]  he is praying
[4638.80 --> 4639.56]  on behalf
[4639.56 --> 4640.34]  of those people
[4640.34 --> 4641.44]  who would come
[4641.44 --> 4642.52]  to believe
[4642.52 --> 4643.16]  in him
[4643.16 --> 4644.06]  not just the people
[4644.06 --> 4644.36]  then
[4644.36 --> 4645.30]  not just his disciples
[4645.30 --> 4645.60]  then
[4645.60 --> 4646.58]  but also us
[4646.58 --> 4648.54]  now as 21st century
[4648.54 --> 4649.82]  believers in Jesus
[4649.82 --> 4651.10]  Jesus prays for us
[4651.10 --> 4651.62]  and he says
[4651.62 --> 4653.08]  sanctify them
[4653.08 --> 4654.22]  by your truth
[4654.22 --> 4656.18]  your word
[4656.18 --> 4657.78]  is truth
[4657.78 --> 4660.32]  and then finally
[4660.32 --> 4661.90]  in John 18
[4661.90 --> 4663.58]  Jesus is
[4663.58 --> 4665.02]  standing before
[4665.02 --> 4665.56]  Pilate
[4665.56 --> 4666.26]  he has been
[4666.26 --> 4667.06]  betrayed
[4667.06 --> 4668.90]  and disowned
[4668.90 --> 4669.64]  by Peter
[4669.64 --> 4670.26]  and he's brought
[4670.26 --> 4671.52]  before the Roman
[4671.52 --> 4672.00]  governor
[4672.00 --> 4672.80]  who the Jewish
[4672.80 --> 4673.60]  religious leaders
[4673.60 --> 4674.20]  need to get
[4674.20 --> 4675.00]  approval from
[4675.00 --> 4675.74]  before they can
[4675.74 --> 4676.30]  carry out
[4676.30 --> 4677.26]  the sentence of death
[4677.26 --> 4678.70]  and Pilate asks
[4678.70 --> 4679.24]  Jesus
[4679.24 --> 4680.30]  are you the king
[4680.30 --> 4680.86]  of the Jews
[4680.86 --> 4682.26]  and Jesus says
[4682.26 --> 4683.00]  and I'll paraphrase
[4683.00 --> 4683.28]  he says
[4683.28 --> 4684.48]  are you asking me
[4684.48 --> 4685.00]  that question
[4685.00 --> 4685.72]  or are others
[4685.72 --> 4686.28]  putting words
[4686.28 --> 4686.88]  in your mouth
[4686.88 --> 4688.28]  Pilate says
[4688.28 --> 4689.24]  I'm not a Jew
[4689.24 --> 4689.90]  I don't know
[4689.90 --> 4690.96]  who you are
[4690.96 --> 4691.72]  or what this is
[4691.72 --> 4692.46]  really about
[4692.46 --> 4693.80]  so Jesus says
[4693.80 --> 4694.58]  well my kingdom
[4694.58 --> 4696.12]  is not of this world
[4696.12 --> 4696.76]  it is from
[4696.76 --> 4698.00]  another place
[4698.00 --> 4698.82]  and Pilate hears
[4698.82 --> 4699.52]  that word kingdom
[4699.52 --> 4699.86]  and goes
[4699.86 --> 4700.94]  ah so you are
[4700.94 --> 4701.38]  a king
[4701.38 --> 4702.26]  and then
[4702.26 --> 4703.56]  Jesus looks
[4703.56 --> 4704.34]  at Pilate
[4704.34 --> 4704.90]  and I'll stop
[4704.90 --> 4705.58]  paraphrasing
[4705.58 --> 4706.40]  in John 18
[4706.40 --> 4707.00]  37
[4707.00 --> 4707.98]  Jesus says
[4707.98 --> 4709.60]  you say
[4709.60 --> 4710.40]  that I am a king
[4710.40 --> 4711.62]  in fact
[4711.62 --> 4712.54]  the reason
[4712.54 --> 4713.28]  I was born
[4713.28 --> 4714.04]  and came into
[4714.04 --> 4714.54]  the world
[4714.54 --> 4715.62]  is to testify
[4715.62 --> 4716.88]  to the truth
[4716.88 --> 4718.58]  everyone on the
[4718.58 --> 4719.66]  side of truth
[4719.66 --> 4720.42]  listens
[4720.42 --> 4721.68]  to me
[4721.68 --> 4724.08]  Jesus says
[4724.08 --> 4724.58]  the reason
[4724.58 --> 4725.46]  he came into
[4725.46 --> 4726.02]  the world
[4726.02 --> 4727.12]  was to testify
[4727.12 --> 4728.00]  to the truth
[4728.00 --> 4729.52]  of his kingship
[4729.52 --> 4729.70]  right
[4729.70 --> 4730.38]  the truth
[4730.38 --> 4730.78]  here
[4730.78 --> 4731.42]  the word truth
[4731.42 --> 4731.70]  here
[4731.70 --> 4732.92]  is the gospel
[4732.92 --> 4733.58]  of Jesus
[4733.58 --> 4734.24]  as king
[4734.24 --> 4734.80]  over all
[4734.80 --> 4735.22]  the earth
[4735.22 --> 4735.98]  and to be
[4735.98 --> 4736.78]  on the side
[4736.78 --> 4737.76]  of truth
[4737.76 --> 4738.44]  is to be
[4738.44 --> 4739.38]  part of
[4739.38 --> 4740.30]  the kingdom
[4740.30 --> 4741.82]  of Jesus
[4741.82 --> 4743.80]  and then
[4743.80 --> 4744.22]  Pilate
[4744.22 --> 4745.56]  hearing
[4745.56 --> 4746.22]  but not
[4746.22 --> 4747.26]  comprehending
[4747.26 --> 4748.00]  says
[4748.00 --> 4748.98]  in verse
[4748.98 --> 4749.84]  38
[4749.84 --> 4750.32]  of chapter
[4750.32 --> 4750.76]  18
[4750.76 --> 4751.36]  what
[4751.36 --> 4752.48]  is
[4752.48 --> 4753.58]  truth
[4753.58 --> 4755.32]  and that's
[4755.32 --> 4755.66]  really the
[4755.66 --> 4756.04]  question
[4756.04 --> 4758.00]  what
[4758.00 --> 4758.56]  is
[4758.56 --> 4759.38]  truth
[4759.38 --> 4760.64]  and so
[4760.64 --> 4761.30]  does seeing
[4761.30 --> 4761.96]  the way
[4761.96 --> 4762.60]  that John
[4762.60 --> 4763.54]  uses the word
[4763.54 --> 4764.38]  truth
[4764.38 --> 4765.14]  in other
[4765.14 --> 4765.62]  places
[4765.62 --> 4766.32]  help us
[4766.32 --> 4767.26]  understand
[4767.26 --> 4768.50]  how it is
[4768.50 --> 4769.32]  being used
[4769.32 --> 4769.96]  in chapter
[4769.96 --> 4770.42]  4
[4770.42 --> 4771.44]  and chapter
[4771.44 --> 4771.80]  8
[4771.80 --> 4773.58]  in those
[4773.58 --> 4774.34]  other places
[4774.34 --> 4774.84]  sort of
[4774.84 --> 4775.62]  taken as a
[4775.62 --> 4776.00]  whole
[4776.00 --> 4776.72]  truth
[4776.72 --> 4777.30]  is a
[4777.30 --> 4777.88]  character
[4777.88 --> 4778.40]  attribute
[4778.40 --> 4779.34]  of Jesus
[4779.34 --> 4780.20]  part of
[4780.20 --> 4781.12]  the glory
[4781.12 --> 4781.58]  that he
[4781.58 --> 4782.10]  reveals
[4782.10 --> 4782.66]  with grace
[4782.66 --> 4783.24]  and truth
[4783.24 --> 4783.70]  right
[4783.70 --> 4784.02]  Jesus
[4784.02 --> 4784.74]  is the
[4784.74 --> 4785.08]  truth
[4785.08 --> 4785.64]  in some
[4785.64 --> 4785.90]  way
[4785.90 --> 4787.16]  the word
[4787.16 --> 4788.04]  is truth
[4788.04 --> 4788.64]  in another
[4788.64 --> 4788.98]  way
[4788.98 --> 4790.04]  the spirit
[4790.04 --> 4790.92]  leads people
[4790.92 --> 4791.68]  into all
[4791.68 --> 4792.12]  truth
[4792.12 --> 4793.12]  truth
[4793.12 --> 4795.62]  is the
[4795.62 --> 4795.98]  gospel
[4795.98 --> 4796.28]  of
[4796.28 --> 4796.60]  Jesus
[4796.60 --> 4797.58]  kingdom
[4797.58 --> 4799.62]  truth
[4799.62 --> 4800.22]  then
[4800.22 --> 4800.92]  is the
[4800.92 --> 4801.78]  reality
[4801.78 --> 4802.92]  of his
[4802.92 --> 4803.34]  coming
[4803.34 --> 4804.38]  and the
[4804.38 --> 4805.02]  impact
[4805.02 --> 4805.58]  of his
[4805.58 --> 4806.06]  coming
[4806.06 --> 4807.34]  on reality
[4807.34 --> 4809.02]  now I really
[4809.02 --> 4809.52]  like that way
[4809.52 --> 4809.82]  so that's
[4809.82 --> 4810.10]  going to be
[4810.10 --> 4810.32]  our
[4810.32 --> 4811.48]  theme
[4811.48 --> 4812.70]  here
[4812.70 --> 4814.08]  truth
[4814.08 --> 4814.50]  is the
[4814.50 --> 4815.04]  reality
[4815.04 --> 4816.24]  of Jesus
[4816.24 --> 4816.70]  coming
[4816.70 --> 4817.36]  and the
[4817.36 --> 4817.94]  impact
[4817.94 --> 4818.54]  of Jesus
[4818.54 --> 4819.10]  coming
[4819.10 --> 4820.94]  on reality
[4820.94 --> 4822.70]  now
[4822.70 --> 4824.26]  like many
[4824.26 --> 4824.66]  of you
[4824.66 --> 4825.18]  or at least
[4825.18 --> 4825.92]  a small
[4825.92 --> 4826.26]  handful
[4826.26 --> 4826.62]  of you
[4826.62 --> 4827.52]  I just
[4827.52 --> 4827.86]  finished
[4827.86 --> 4828.26]  watching
[4828.26 --> 4828.64]  Loki
[4828.64 --> 4829.38]  on Disney
[4829.38 --> 4829.74]  plus
[4829.74 --> 4830.90]  and that's
[4830.90 --> 4831.44]  all about
[4831.44 --> 4831.88]  bending
[4831.88 --> 4832.60]  reality
[4832.60 --> 4833.52]  and multiple
[4833.52 --> 4834.22]  realities
[4834.22 --> 4834.96]  and stacked
[4834.96 --> 4835.58]  realities
[4835.58 --> 4836.56]  and not
[4836.56 --> 4837.10]  really being
[4837.10 --> 4837.48]  able to
[4837.48 --> 4838.06]  trust the
[4838.06 --> 4838.76]  reality that
[4838.76 --> 4839.06]  you see
[4839.06 --> 4839.38]  in front
[4839.38 --> 4839.66]  of you
[4839.66 --> 4840.60]  so what
[4840.60 --> 4840.88]  I really
[4840.88 --> 4841.40]  like about
[4841.40 --> 4841.80]  this way
[4841.80 --> 4843.14]  of understanding
[4843.14 --> 4843.54]  truth
[4843.54 --> 4844.10]  and John's
[4844.10 --> 4844.66]  use of
[4844.66 --> 4845.22]  the word
[4845.22 --> 4846.02]  is that
[4846.02 --> 4846.90]  truth
[4846.90 --> 4848.60]  becomes
[4848.60 --> 4849.68]  seeing
[4849.68 --> 4850.34]  Jesus
[4850.34 --> 4851.42]  as our
[4851.42 --> 4852.10]  anchor
[4852.10 --> 4853.04]  for
[4853.04 --> 4854.14]  understanding
[4854.14 --> 4855.48]  reality
[4855.48 --> 4857.36]  right Hebrews
[4857.36 --> 4858.32]  13 verse 8
[4858.32 --> 4858.88]  says Jesus
[4858.88 --> 4859.84]  Christ is the
[4859.84 --> 4860.58]  same yesterday
[4860.58 --> 4861.48]  today
[4861.48 --> 4862.72]  and forever
[4862.72 --> 4864.76]  Colossians 1
[4864.76 --> 4866.10]  beautifully says
[4866.10 --> 4866.96]  the son
[4866.96 --> 4868.12]  Jesus is the
[4868.12 --> 4868.98]  image of the
[4868.98 --> 4869.98]  invisible God
[4869.98 --> 4870.68]  the firstborn
[4870.68 --> 4871.64]  over all creation
[4871.64 --> 4872.84]  for in him
[4872.84 --> 4873.62]  all things
[4873.62 --> 4874.34]  were created
[4874.34 --> 4875.04]  things in heaven
[4875.04 --> 4875.62]  and on earth
[4875.62 --> 4876.32]  visible and
[4876.32 --> 4876.70]  invisible
[4876.70 --> 4877.70]  whether thrones
[4877.70 --> 4878.22]  or powers
[4878.22 --> 4878.70]  or rulers
[4878.70 --> 4879.46]  or authorities
[4879.46 --> 4880.16]  all things
[4880.16 --> 4880.52]  have been
[4880.52 --> 4881.02]  created
[4881.02 --> 4881.90]  through him
[4881.90 --> 4882.64]  and for him
[4882.64 --> 4883.54]  he is before
[4883.54 --> 4884.72]  all things
[4884.72 --> 4885.28]  and in him
[4885.28 --> 4885.88]  all things
[4885.88 --> 4886.70]  hold together
[4886.70 --> 4887.38]  he is the
[4887.38 --> 4887.94]  head of the
[4887.94 --> 4888.26]  body
[4888.26 --> 4888.96]  the church
[4888.96 --> 4889.46]  he is the
[4889.46 --> 4889.84]  beginning
[4889.84 --> 4890.44]  and the
[4890.44 --> 4890.90]  firstborn
[4890.90 --> 4891.36]  from among
[4891.36 --> 4891.74]  the dead
[4891.74 --> 4892.18]  so that
[4892.18 --> 4893.04]  in everything
[4893.04 --> 4894.20]  he might
[4894.20 --> 4894.62]  have
[4894.62 --> 4895.64]  the supremacy
[4895.64 --> 4898.24]  John 1
[4898.24 --> 4899.66]  we read
[4899.66 --> 4900.34]  in the beginning
[4900.34 --> 4901.46]  was the word
[4901.46 --> 4902.08]  and the word
[4902.08 --> 4903.32]  was with God
[4903.32 --> 4904.00]  and the word
[4904.00 --> 4905.20]  was God
[4905.20 --> 4905.78]  he was with
[4905.78 --> 4906.36]  God in the
[4906.36 --> 4906.68]  beginning
[4906.68 --> 4907.26]  and through
[4907.26 --> 4907.64]  him
[4907.64 --> 4908.44]  all things
[4908.44 --> 4909.08]  were made
[4909.08 --> 4910.04]  without him
[4910.04 --> 4910.82]  nothing was
[4910.82 --> 4911.18]  made
[4911.18 --> 4911.80]  that has
[4911.80 --> 4912.14]  been
[4912.14 --> 4912.92]  made
[4912.92 --> 4914.62]  this is a
[4914.62 --> 4915.76]  great little
[4915.76 --> 4916.96]  verse for us
[4916.96 --> 4917.70]  because we see
[4917.70 --> 4919.78]  Jesus as the word
[4919.78 --> 4921.30]  is in the beginning
[4921.30 --> 4922.84]  and John wants to
[4922.84 --> 4923.96]  ground his teaching
[4923.96 --> 4925.16]  of who Jesus is
[4925.16 --> 4926.50]  in more than just
[4926.50 --> 4927.64]  the first century
[4927.64 --> 4928.68]  incarnation
[4928.68 --> 4929.06]  right
[4929.06 --> 4930.42]  John is deliberately
[4930.42 --> 4931.90]  invoking the language
[4931.90 --> 4932.86]  of creation
[4932.86 --> 4933.86]  you remember
[4933.86 --> 4933.88]  you remember
[4933.88 --> 4934.98]  Genesis 1
[4934.98 --> 4935.46]  perhaps
[4935.46 --> 4935.72]  right
[4935.72 --> 4936.52]  in the beginning
[4936.52 --> 4937.16]  God
[4937.16 --> 4939.70]  in the beginning
[4939.70 --> 4940.52]  was the word
[4940.52 --> 4942.10]  the second person
[4942.10 --> 4943.20]  of the trinity
[4943.20 --> 4943.80]  right
[4943.80 --> 4944.34]  the word
[4944.34 --> 4945.26]  is the agent
[4945.26 --> 4946.00]  of God
[4946.00 --> 4947.12]  at creation
[4947.12 --> 4948.38]  God speaks
[4948.38 --> 4949.80]  let there be light
[4949.80 --> 4950.88]  and it was so
[4950.88 --> 4952.40]  that is his word
[4952.40 --> 4953.62]  this is his
[4953.62 --> 4954.40]  voice
[4954.40 --> 4955.40]  the word
[4955.40 --> 4956.22]  Jesus
[4956.22 --> 4957.66]  defines
[4957.66 --> 4959.18]  reality
[4959.18 --> 4961.42]  that word
[4961.42 --> 4962.46]  takes on flesh
[4962.46 --> 4963.30]  in the person
[4963.30 --> 4963.74]  of Jesus
[4963.74 --> 4964.58]  and enters
[4964.58 --> 4965.28]  into
[4965.28 --> 4966.22]  our
[4966.22 --> 4967.46]  reality
[4967.46 --> 4969.32]  truth
[4969.32 --> 4970.42]  is the reality
[4970.42 --> 4971.14]  of Jesus
[4971.14 --> 4971.66]  coming
[4971.66 --> 4972.62]  and the impact
[4972.62 --> 4973.06]  of Jesus
[4973.06 --> 4973.60]  coming
[4973.60 --> 4974.86]  on reality
[4974.86 --> 4977.04]  and so remember
[4977.04 --> 4977.64]  when we did that
[4977.64 --> 4978.82]  little word study
[4978.82 --> 4979.10]  right
[4979.10 --> 4980.06]  Jesus prayed
[4980.06 --> 4980.92]  in his high priestly
[4980.92 --> 4981.36]  prayer
[4981.36 --> 4982.84]  sanctify them
[4982.84 --> 4983.88]  by your truth
[4983.88 --> 4985.66]  your word
[4985.66 --> 4986.66]  is
[4986.66 --> 4987.64]  truth
[4987.64 --> 4989.60]  God's word
[4989.60 --> 4990.60]  is truth
[4990.60 --> 4991.14]  and Jesus
[4991.14 --> 4992.14]  is God's word
[4992.14 --> 4993.20]  made flesh
[4993.20 --> 4993.82]  God's word
[4993.82 --> 4994.50]  is the truth
[4994.50 --> 4995.22]  that creates
[4995.22 --> 4995.94]  and defines
[4995.94 --> 4996.74]  reality
[4996.74 --> 4997.82]  and that truth
[4997.82 --> 4999.04]  has come among us
[4999.04 --> 5000.30]  to sanctify us
[5000.30 --> 5001.36]  that's a word
[5001.36 --> 5001.78]  in the Bible
[5001.78 --> 5002.06]  that means
[5002.06 --> 5002.90]  to make us
[5002.90 --> 5003.52]  holy
[5003.52 --> 5004.56]  to set us
[5004.56 --> 5005.18]  apart
[5005.18 --> 5006.54]  to change you
[5006.54 --> 5007.50]  from lost
[5007.50 --> 5008.16]  in darkness
[5008.16 --> 5009.26]  to at home
[5009.26 --> 5010.18]  in light
[5010.18 --> 5011.14]  from a heart
[5011.14 --> 5011.76]  of stone
[5011.76 --> 5012.60]  to a heart
[5012.60 --> 5013.16]  of flesh
[5013.16 --> 5014.24]  to transform you
[5014.24 --> 5014.82]  from enemies
[5014.82 --> 5015.34]  of God
[5015.34 --> 5016.44]  stuck in our sins
[5016.44 --> 5017.56]  and our transgressions
[5017.56 --> 5018.98]  to lavishly loved
[5018.98 --> 5020.16]  children of the Father
[5020.16 --> 5021.30]  heirs of God
[5021.30 --> 5022.12]  and co-heirs
[5022.12 --> 5023.52]  with Christ
[5023.52 --> 5025.54]  the truth is
[5025.54 --> 5026.20]  Jesus
[5026.20 --> 5027.04]  has
[5027.04 --> 5027.92]  come
[5027.92 --> 5029.12]  the truth
[5029.12 --> 5029.70]  is
[5029.70 --> 5030.66]  Jesus coming
[5030.66 --> 5031.74]  changes your
[5031.74 --> 5032.64]  reality
[5032.64 --> 5033.80]  and the truth is
[5033.80 --> 5035.02]  Jesus will come
[5035.02 --> 5035.64]  again
[5035.64 --> 5036.96]  and all reality
[5036.96 --> 5038.28]  will be changed
[5038.28 --> 5038.86]  that
[5038.86 --> 5039.50]  is
[5039.50 --> 5040.42]  truth
[5040.42 --> 5043.66]  and let me be
[5043.66 --> 5044.30]  really
[5044.30 --> 5046.64]  really clear
[5046.64 --> 5047.64]  truth
[5047.64 --> 5048.94]  this isn't
[5048.94 --> 5049.46]  just my
[5049.46 --> 5049.92]  truth
[5049.92 --> 5051.96]  or Christian
[5051.96 --> 5052.50]  truth
[5052.50 --> 5053.66]  or relative
[5053.66 --> 5054.32]  truth
[5054.32 --> 5055.22]  this is
[5055.22 --> 5056.08]  reality
[5056.08 --> 5057.12]  truth
[5057.12 --> 5057.70]  this isn't
[5057.70 --> 5057.94]  just
[5057.94 --> 5058.66]  Jared's
[5058.66 --> 5058.94]  truth
[5058.94 --> 5059.20]  or
[5059.20 --> 5060.00]  Hadassah's
[5060.00 --> 5060.28]  truth
[5060.28 --> 5061.00]  or Noah's
[5061.00 --> 5061.34]  truth
[5061.34 --> 5062.12]  the truth
[5062.12 --> 5062.54]  that they
[5062.54 --> 5063.48]  profess today
[5063.48 --> 5064.34]  is more
[5064.34 --> 5064.76]  than that
[5064.76 --> 5065.40]  this is a
[5065.40 --> 5066.32]  belief in
[5066.32 --> 5066.90]  the real
[5066.90 --> 5067.70]  and a real
[5067.70 --> 5068.24]  belief
[5068.24 --> 5069.66]  if truth
[5069.66 --> 5070.20]  is what
[5070.20 --> 5070.82]  corresponds
[5070.82 --> 5071.86]  to reality
[5071.86 --> 5072.60]  then surely
[5072.60 --> 5073.32]  the creator
[5073.32 --> 5074.34]  of reality
[5074.34 --> 5075.30]  is
[5075.30 --> 5076.32]  truth
[5076.32 --> 5079.16]  truth
[5079.16 --> 5079.58]  is the
[5079.58 --> 5080.00]  reality
[5080.00 --> 5080.54]  of Jesus
[5080.54 --> 5080.96]  coming
[5080.96 --> 5081.58]  and the
[5081.58 --> 5081.92]  impact
[5081.92 --> 5082.26]  of Jesus
[5082.26 --> 5082.74]  coming
[5082.74 --> 5084.10]  on reality
[5084.10 --> 5086.82]  and this
[5086.82 --> 5087.18]  is actually
[5087.18 --> 5087.62]  the third
[5087.62 --> 5088.08]  step
[5088.08 --> 5089.42]  in understanding
[5089.42 --> 5089.98]  any Bible
[5089.98 --> 5090.42]  text
[5090.42 --> 5092.44]  Jesus changes
[5092.44 --> 5093.24]  everything
[5093.24 --> 5094.26]  and so
[5094.26 --> 5094.86]  everything
[5094.86 --> 5096.00]  is about
[5096.00 --> 5097.14]  Jesus
[5097.14 --> 5099.04]  in the Bible
[5099.04 --> 5100.44]  everything
[5100.44 --> 5101.52]  is about
[5101.52 --> 5102.36]  Jesus
[5102.36 --> 5102.86]  Jesus
[5102.86 --> 5103.46]  is the
[5103.46 --> 5103.74]  point
[5103.74 --> 5104.06]  of it
[5104.06 --> 5104.34]  all
[5104.34 --> 5104.74]  and you
[5104.74 --> 5105.20]  can't
[5105.20 --> 5105.64]  truly
[5105.64 --> 5106.60]  genuinely
[5106.60 --> 5107.38]  understand
[5107.38 --> 5108.46]  any text
[5108.46 --> 5109.36]  unless you
[5109.36 --> 5110.08]  understand it
[5110.08 --> 5110.80]  in relation
[5110.80 --> 5112.32]  to Jesus
[5112.32 --> 5113.08]  either as
[5113.08 --> 5113.64]  fulfillment
[5113.64 --> 5114.68]  or contrast
[5114.68 --> 5115.12]  type
[5115.12 --> 5115.86]  anti-type
[5115.86 --> 5116.60]  promise
[5116.60 --> 5117.56]  foreshadow
[5117.56 --> 5118.04]  right
[5118.04 --> 5118.98]  in fact
[5118.98 --> 5119.50]  Jesus
[5119.50 --> 5120.06]  himself
[5120.06 --> 5120.80]  tells us
[5120.80 --> 5121.22]  this
[5121.22 --> 5121.72]  right
[5121.72 --> 5122.30]  in John
[5122.30 --> 5122.80]  5
[5122.80 --> 5123.48]  Jesus
[5123.48 --> 5123.94]  says
[5123.94 --> 5124.22]  to the
[5124.22 --> 5124.50]  teachers
[5124.50 --> 5124.80]  of the
[5124.80 --> 5125.02]  law
[5125.02 --> 5125.86]  and Pharisees
[5125.86 --> 5126.26]  he says
[5126.26 --> 5127.34]  you study
[5127.34 --> 5127.92]  the scriptures
[5127.92 --> 5128.50]  diligently
[5128.50 --> 5129.14]  because you
[5129.14 --> 5129.54]  think that
[5129.54 --> 5129.92]  in them
[5129.92 --> 5130.32]  you have
[5130.32 --> 5130.74]  eternal
[5130.74 --> 5131.16]  life
[5131.16 --> 5132.00]  these
[5132.00 --> 5132.46]  are the
[5132.46 --> 5132.80]  very
[5132.80 --> 5133.32]  scriptures
[5133.32 --> 5134.24]  that testify
[5134.24 --> 5135.06]  about
[5135.06 --> 5136.08]  me
[5136.08 --> 5136.72]  says
[5136.72 --> 5137.12]  Jesus
[5137.12 --> 5137.96]  right
[5137.96 --> 5138.26]  he goes
[5138.26 --> 5138.68]  on
[5138.68 --> 5139.30]  if you
[5139.30 --> 5139.66]  believed
[5139.66 --> 5140.12]  Moses
[5140.12 --> 5140.72]  you would
[5140.72 --> 5141.06]  believe
[5141.06 --> 5141.52]  me
[5141.52 --> 5142.30]  for he
[5142.30 --> 5142.88]  wrote
[5142.88 --> 5143.12]  about
[5143.12 --> 5143.58]  me
[5143.58 --> 5145.92]  right
[5145.92 --> 5146.20]  on the
[5146.20 --> 5146.82]  road to
[5146.82 --> 5147.50]  Emmaus
[5147.50 --> 5148.52]  after the
[5148.52 --> 5148.98]  resurrection
[5148.98 --> 5150.34]  in Luke's
[5150.34 --> 5151.38]  gospel account
[5151.38 --> 5153.28]  Luke tells
[5153.28 --> 5153.86]  us that
[5153.86 --> 5154.78]  Jesus
[5154.78 --> 5155.80]  beginning
[5155.80 --> 5156.56]  with Moses
[5156.56 --> 5157.08]  and all
[5157.08 --> 5157.66]  the prophets
[5157.66 --> 5158.64]  explained
[5158.64 --> 5159.22]  to them
[5159.22 --> 5159.60]  the two
[5159.60 --> 5159.96]  disciples
[5159.96 --> 5160.24]  on the
[5160.24 --> 5160.44]  road
[5160.44 --> 5160.94]  what was
[5160.94 --> 5161.22]  said
[5161.22 --> 5161.88]  in all
[5161.88 --> 5162.50]  the scriptures
[5162.50 --> 5163.58]  concerning
[5163.58 --> 5164.56]  himself
[5164.56 --> 5166.18]  right
[5166.18 --> 5166.58]  here's the
[5166.58 --> 5166.92]  thing
[5166.92 --> 5167.76]  if you want
[5167.76 --> 5168.60]  to actually
[5168.60 --> 5169.66]  truly
[5169.66 --> 5170.46]  fully
[5170.46 --> 5171.18]  understand
[5171.18 --> 5171.62]  a bible
[5171.62 --> 5171.94]  text
[5171.94 --> 5172.70]  you need
[5172.70 --> 5173.22]  to take
[5173.22 --> 5173.56]  it to
[5173.56 --> 5173.90]  Jesus
[5173.90 --> 5174.28]  or you
[5174.28 --> 5174.52]  need to
[5174.52 --> 5174.90]  let it
[5174.90 --> 5175.46]  take you
[5175.46 --> 5176.46]  to Jesus
[5176.46 --> 5178.26]  right
[5178.26 --> 5178.88]  start with
[5178.88 --> 5179.58]  the text
[5179.58 --> 5180.28]  and the
[5180.28 --> 5180.74]  story
[5180.74 --> 5182.64]  and get
[5182.64 --> 5182.90]  to the
[5182.90 --> 5183.20]  gospel
[5183.20 --> 5183.68]  of Jesus
[5183.68 --> 5185.14]  the
[5185.14 --> 5185.64]  reality
[5185.64 --> 5186.20]  of Jesus
[5186.20 --> 5187.06]  coming
[5187.06 --> 5187.44]  and the
[5187.44 --> 5187.80]  impact
[5187.80 --> 5188.20]  of Jesus
[5188.20 --> 5188.76]  coming
[5188.76 --> 5190.04]  works
[5190.04 --> 5191.24]  its way
[5191.24 --> 5191.70]  from
[5191.70 --> 5192.54]  Genesis 1
[5192.54 --> 5192.90]  to
[5192.90 --> 5194.08]  Revelation 22
[5194.08 --> 5196.04]  now obviously
[5196.04 --> 5196.76]  this is easier
[5196.76 --> 5197.52]  to do in some
[5197.52 --> 5197.74]  of the
[5197.74 --> 5198.18]  gospels
[5198.18 --> 5198.60]  or even
[5198.60 --> 5198.96]  in some
[5198.96 --> 5199.14]  of the
[5199.14 --> 5199.30]  letters
[5199.30 --> 5199.78]  of Paul
[5199.78 --> 5200.44]  but it's
[5200.44 --> 5201.00]  true also
[5201.00 --> 5201.36]  in the
[5201.36 --> 5201.82]  story of
[5201.82 --> 5202.12]  Joseph
[5202.12 --> 5203.12]  or Job
[5203.12 --> 5203.42]  it's
[5203.42 --> 5203.88]  true in
[5203.88 --> 5204.04]  the
[5204.04 --> 5204.46]  Psalms
[5204.46 --> 5205.04]  or the
[5205.04 --> 5205.42]  Proverbs
[5205.42 --> 5205.72]  it's
[5205.72 --> 5206.20]  true in
[5206.20 --> 5206.34]  the
[5206.34 --> 5207.00]  Lamentations
[5207.00 --> 5207.34]  in the
[5207.34 --> 5207.60]  book of
[5207.60 --> 5208.06]  Lamentations
[5208.06 --> 5208.38]  it's
[5208.38 --> 5208.64]  even
[5208.64 --> 5208.96]  true
[5208.96 --> 5209.52]  in the
[5209.52 --> 5209.92]  horrors
[5209.92 --> 5210.12]  of
[5210.12 --> 5210.84]  Hosea
[5210.84 --> 5211.70]  every
[5211.70 --> 5212.16]  text
[5212.16 --> 5212.60]  every
[5212.60 --> 5213.10]  step
[5213.10 --> 5213.66]  along
[5213.66 --> 5213.84]  the
[5213.84 --> 5214.12]  way
[5214.12 --> 5214.76]  takes
[5214.76 --> 5215.10]  you
[5215.10 --> 5215.58]  to
[5215.58 --> 5215.88]  Jesus
[5215.88 --> 5216.84]  and so
[5216.84 --> 5217.24]  when you
[5217.24 --> 5217.96]  study a
[5217.96 --> 5218.42]  text of
[5218.42 --> 5218.90]  the Bible
[5218.90 --> 5219.68]  you've got to
[5219.68 --> 5219.98]  get to
[5219.98 --> 5220.36]  Jesus
[5220.36 --> 5222.24]  or you
[5222.24 --> 5222.66]  didn't actually
[5222.66 --> 5223.12]  study that
[5223.12 --> 5223.48]  text
[5223.48 --> 5224.28]  at least
[5224.28 --> 5224.54]  not in
[5224.54 --> 5224.70]  its
[5224.70 --> 5224.90]  form
[5224.90 --> 5226.94]  and so
[5226.94 --> 5228.00]  mining
[5228.00 --> 5228.62]  the text
[5228.62 --> 5229.68]  exploring
[5229.68 --> 5230.48]  the context
[5230.48 --> 5231.30]  how does
[5231.30 --> 5231.90]  that help
[5231.90 --> 5233.06]  us understand
[5233.06 --> 5233.72]  the text
[5233.72 --> 5234.38]  to reveal
[5234.38 --> 5235.02]  the truth
[5235.02 --> 5236.00]  about
[5236.00 --> 5237.04]  Jesus
[5237.04 --> 5239.80]  you guys
[5239.80 --> 5240.22]  are smart
[5240.22 --> 5240.82]  you've
[5240.82 --> 5241.08]  probably
[5241.08 --> 5241.44]  pieced
[5241.44 --> 5241.56]  it
[5241.56 --> 5241.94]  together
[5241.94 --> 5242.96]  but for
[5242.96 --> 5243.24]  those of
[5243.24 --> 5243.48]  you just
[5243.48 --> 5243.68]  tuning
[5243.68 --> 5244.08]  back in
[5244.08 --> 5244.36]  for those
[5244.36 --> 5244.50]  of you
[5244.50 --> 5244.68]  just
[5244.68 --> 5244.94]  waking
[5244.94 --> 5245.20]  up
[5245.20 --> 5245.66]  we're
[5245.66 --> 5245.86]  nearing
[5245.86 --> 5246.18]  the end
[5246.18 --> 5246.44]  so you
[5246.44 --> 5246.70]  came in
[5246.70 --> 5246.92]  the right
[5246.92 --> 5247.24]  spot
[5247.24 --> 5248.78]  in John
[5248.78 --> 5249.70]  4 23
[5249.70 --> 5250.20]  Jesus
[5250.20 --> 5250.76]  says
[5250.76 --> 5251.50]  yet a
[5251.50 --> 5252.08]  time is
[5252.08 --> 5252.54]  coming
[5252.54 --> 5253.38]  and has
[5253.38 --> 5253.94]  now come
[5253.94 --> 5254.46]  when the
[5254.46 --> 5254.72]  true
[5254.72 --> 5255.36]  worshipers
[5255.36 --> 5255.88]  will worship
[5255.88 --> 5256.36]  the Father
[5256.36 --> 5256.76]  in the
[5256.76 --> 5257.08]  spirit
[5257.08 --> 5258.04]  and in
[5258.04 --> 5258.36]  truth
[5258.36 --> 5259.32]  God
[5259.32 --> 5259.86]  is spirit
[5259.86 --> 5260.22]  and his
[5260.22 --> 5260.70]  worshipers
[5260.70 --> 5261.42]  must worship
[5261.42 --> 5262.14]  in the
[5262.14 --> 5262.40]  spirit
[5262.40 --> 5263.46]  and in
[5263.46 --> 5264.12]  truth
[5264.12 --> 5264.82]  and then
[5264.82 --> 5265.12]  in John
[5265.12 --> 5265.38]  8
[5265.38 --> 5265.74]  if you
[5265.74 --> 5266.14]  hold to
[5266.14 --> 5266.62]  my teaching
[5266.62 --> 5267.00]  you are
[5267.00 --> 5267.46]  really my
[5267.46 --> 5267.98]  disciples
[5267.98 --> 5268.74]  then you
[5268.74 --> 5269.18]  will know
[5269.18 --> 5269.78]  the truth
[5269.78 --> 5270.40]  and the
[5270.40 --> 5270.74]  truth
[5270.74 --> 5271.48]  will set
[5271.48 --> 5272.04]  you
[5272.04 --> 5272.72]  free
[5272.72 --> 5274.40]  right
[5274.40 --> 5274.64]  and then
[5274.64 --> 5274.96]  in verse
[5274.96 --> 5275.44]  44
[5275.44 --> 5276.10]  and following
[5276.10 --> 5276.86]  Jesus
[5276.86 --> 5277.16]  says
[5277.16 --> 5277.42]  it is
[5277.42 --> 5277.84]  the devil
[5277.84 --> 5278.54]  who lies
[5278.54 --> 5279.38]  and Jesus
[5279.38 --> 5279.94]  who tells
[5279.94 --> 5280.26]  the truth
[5280.26 --> 5280.50]  that if
[5280.50 --> 5280.84]  you really
[5280.84 --> 5281.46]  belong to
[5281.46 --> 5281.76]  God
[5281.76 --> 5282.08]  you will
[5282.08 --> 5282.50]  know the
[5282.50 --> 5282.74]  truth
[5282.74 --> 5283.36]  of who
[5283.36 --> 5283.64]  Jesus
[5283.64 --> 5284.08]  is
[5284.08 --> 5284.68]  and what
[5284.68 --> 5285.30]  he says
[5285.30 --> 5285.66]  as
[5285.66 --> 5286.28]  true
[5286.28 --> 5287.50]  truth
[5287.50 --> 5288.10]  is the
[5288.10 --> 5288.60]  reality
[5288.60 --> 5289.14]  of Jesus
[5289.14 --> 5289.52]  coming
[5289.52 --> 5289.88]  and the
[5289.88 --> 5290.26]  impact
[5290.26 --> 5290.54]  of his
[5290.54 --> 5290.86]  coming
[5290.86 --> 5291.88]  on reality
[5291.88 --> 5292.36]  and so
[5292.36 --> 5292.94]  when Jesus
[5292.94 --> 5293.50]  says
[5293.50 --> 5293.90]  true
[5293.90 --> 5294.64]  worshipers
[5294.64 --> 5295.48]  will worship
[5295.48 --> 5295.98]  the Father
[5295.98 --> 5296.48]  in the
[5296.48 --> 5296.74]  spirit
[5296.74 --> 5297.28]  and in
[5297.28 --> 5297.60]  truth
[5297.60 --> 5298.56]  he means
[5298.56 --> 5299.34]  the truth
[5299.34 --> 5299.78]  of
[5299.78 --> 5300.58]  himself
[5300.58 --> 5302.24]  the reality
[5302.24 --> 5302.78]  changing
[5302.78 --> 5303.22]  truth
[5303.22 --> 5303.52]  of what
[5303.52 --> 5303.96]  he has
[5303.96 --> 5304.44]  come to
[5304.44 --> 5304.80]  do
[5304.80 --> 5305.44]  and his
[5305.44 --> 5305.82]  kingdom
[5305.82 --> 5306.46]  on earth
[5306.46 --> 5308.40]  the Samaritan's
[5308.40 --> 5309.02]  woman's
[5309.02 --> 5310.20]  life
[5310.20 --> 5310.74]  is
[5310.74 --> 5311.86]  changed
[5311.86 --> 5312.24]  by her
[5312.24 --> 5312.68]  interaction
[5312.68 --> 5313.10]  with Jesus
[5313.10 --> 5313.40]  and that
[5313.40 --> 5313.64]  actually
[5313.64 --> 5314.52]  confirms
[5314.52 --> 5315.42]  our point
[5315.42 --> 5315.88]  this morning
[5315.88 --> 5316.68]  she was
[5316.68 --> 5317.32]  changed
[5317.32 --> 5317.72]  by her
[5317.72 --> 5318.18]  encounter
[5318.18 --> 5319.20]  with Jesus
[5319.20 --> 5319.98]  so much
[5319.98 --> 5320.40]  so that
[5320.40 --> 5320.70]  when she
[5320.70 --> 5321.30]  left that
[5321.30 --> 5322.12]  well there
[5322.12 --> 5322.48]  she went
[5322.48 --> 5323.12]  back into
[5323.12 --> 5324.00]  her town
[5324.00 --> 5324.34]  and she
[5324.34 --> 5325.24]  told everybody
[5325.24 --> 5326.00]  about this
[5326.00 --> 5326.42]  man that
[5326.42 --> 5326.80]  she had met
[5326.80 --> 5327.06]  she said
[5327.06 --> 5327.80]  come and see
[5327.80 --> 5328.40]  a man who
[5328.40 --> 5328.94]  has told me
[5328.94 --> 5329.90]  everything I
[5329.90 --> 5330.38]  have ever
[5330.38 --> 5330.68]  done
[5330.68 --> 5331.44]  could this
[5331.44 --> 5331.84]  be the
[5331.84 --> 5332.24]  Messiah
[5332.24 --> 5333.02]  and her
[5333.02 --> 5333.76]  reality
[5333.76 --> 5334.60]  was so
[5334.60 --> 5335.16]  affected
[5335.16 --> 5336.34]  that she
[5336.34 --> 5336.94]  was used
[5336.94 --> 5337.60]  by God
[5337.60 --> 5338.36]  to change
[5338.36 --> 5339.12]  the realities
[5339.12 --> 5339.70]  of those
[5339.70 --> 5340.04]  in her
[5340.04 --> 5340.52]  hometown
[5340.52 --> 5342.12]  they actually
[5342.12 --> 5342.84]  come later
[5342.84 --> 5343.76]  in the story
[5343.76 --> 5344.58]  in chapter 4
[5344.58 --> 5345.44]  they come
[5345.44 --> 5346.02]  and they say
[5346.02 --> 5346.42]  to her
[5346.42 --> 5347.50]  we no longer
[5347.50 --> 5348.10]  believe
[5348.10 --> 5348.84]  just as
[5348.84 --> 5349.76]  just because
[5349.76 --> 5350.30]  of what you
[5350.30 --> 5350.66]  said
[5350.66 --> 5351.58]  now we
[5351.58 --> 5352.32]  have heard
[5352.32 --> 5353.34]  for ourselves
[5353.34 --> 5354.22]  and we
[5354.22 --> 5354.82]  know
[5354.82 --> 5355.66]  that this
[5355.66 --> 5356.40]  man really
[5356.40 --> 5357.14]  is the
[5357.14 --> 5357.44]  savior
[5357.44 --> 5358.44]  of the
[5358.44 --> 5358.76]  world
[5358.76 --> 5360.86]  meeting
[5360.86 --> 5361.20]  Jesus
[5361.20 --> 5361.70]  changed
[5361.70 --> 5362.00]  their
[5362.00 --> 5363.16]  reality
[5363.16 --> 5364.58]  same is
[5364.58 --> 5364.92]  true in
[5364.92 --> 5365.50]  chapter 8
[5365.50 --> 5366.40]  right
[5366.40 --> 5366.78]  then you
[5366.78 --> 5367.08]  will know
[5367.08 --> 5367.52]  the truth
[5367.52 --> 5367.86]  and the
[5367.86 --> 5368.08]  truth
[5368.08 --> 5368.54]  will set
[5368.54 --> 5369.00]  you free
[5369.00 --> 5369.54]  but what
[5369.54 --> 5369.90]  truth
[5369.90 --> 5371.80]  the reality
[5371.80 --> 5372.26]  of Jesus
[5372.26 --> 5372.66]  coming
[5372.66 --> 5373.00]  and the
[5373.00 --> 5373.38]  impact
[5373.38 --> 5373.72]  of Jesus
[5373.72 --> 5374.12]  coming
[5374.12 --> 5375.32]  on reality
[5375.32 --> 5376.68]  out of
[5376.68 --> 5377.36]  his great
[5377.36 --> 5377.96]  love for
[5377.96 --> 5378.22]  us
[5378.22 --> 5378.52]  Jesus
[5378.52 --> 5379.00]  comes
[5379.00 --> 5379.44]  into
[5379.44 --> 5380.08]  the world
[5380.08 --> 5380.46]  right
[5380.46 --> 5380.94]  the world
[5380.94 --> 5381.40]  that he
[5381.40 --> 5382.16]  created
[5382.16 --> 5382.54]  and he
[5382.54 --> 5382.88]  lives
[5382.88 --> 5383.40]  the life
[5383.40 --> 5383.82]  I should
[5383.82 --> 5384.30]  have lived
[5384.30 --> 5385.10]  and dies
[5385.10 --> 5385.70]  the death
[5385.70 --> 5386.20]  that I
[5386.20 --> 5386.56]  deserve
[5386.56 --> 5387.00]  and by
[5387.00 --> 5387.92]  his amazing
[5387.92 --> 5388.34]  grace
[5388.34 --> 5389.46]  my reality
[5389.46 --> 5390.50]  is changed
[5390.50 --> 5391.32]  from death
[5391.32 --> 5392.06]  to life
[5392.06 --> 5393.42]  I am a new
[5393.42 --> 5394.24]  creation
[5394.24 --> 5395.10]  by grace
[5395.10 --> 5395.84]  through faith
[5395.84 --> 5397.38]  you are a new
[5397.38 --> 5398.18]  creation
[5398.18 --> 5399.92]  this is truth
[5399.92 --> 5401.34]  this is gospel
[5401.34 --> 5402.26]  you are set
[5402.26 --> 5403.56]  free from sin
[5403.56 --> 5404.08]  and death
[5404.08 --> 5404.80]  because of his
[5404.80 --> 5406.18]  life and resurrection
[5406.18 --> 5407.48]  that's the truth
[5407.48 --> 5408.42]  of John 4
[5408.42 --> 5409.34]  and John 8
[5409.34 --> 5411.04]  the truth
[5411.04 --> 5412.54]  is the reality
[5412.54 --> 5413.10]  of Jesus
[5413.10 --> 5413.52]  coming
[5413.52 --> 5414.64]  and the impact
[5414.64 --> 5415.20]  of Jesus
[5415.20 --> 5415.62]  coming
[5415.62 --> 5416.64]  on reality
[5416.64 --> 5417.50]  everything
[5417.50 --> 5418.06]  points
[5418.06 --> 5418.84]  to Jesus
[5418.84 --> 5419.38]  and that
[5419.38 --> 5419.96]  means
[5419.96 --> 5420.48]  Jesus
[5420.48 --> 5421.42]  changes
[5421.42 --> 5422.46]  everything
[5422.46 --> 5425.68]  and that's
[5425.68 --> 5426.20]  step 4
[5426.20 --> 5427.48]  to how you
[5427.48 --> 5428.44]  understand a text
[5428.44 --> 5430.50]  every text
[5430.50 --> 5431.26]  is about Jesus
[5431.26 --> 5432.24]  and so
[5432.24 --> 5433.24]  every text
[5433.24 --> 5434.74]  has a call
[5434.74 --> 5436.06]  to action
[5436.06 --> 5437.64]  right
[5437.64 --> 5438.10]  every text
[5438.10 --> 5438.68]  has an answer
[5438.68 --> 5439.36]  to what
[5439.36 --> 5440.12]  does this
[5440.12 --> 5441.08]  change
[5441.08 --> 5444.00]  2 Timothy 3
[5444.00 --> 5445.18]  we read
[5445.18 --> 5445.56]  that all
[5445.56 --> 5445.98]  scripture
[5445.98 --> 5446.58]  is God
[5446.58 --> 5447.18]  breathed
[5447.18 --> 5448.04]  and is useful
[5448.04 --> 5448.72]  for teaching
[5448.72 --> 5449.32]  rebuking
[5449.32 --> 5449.78]  correcting
[5449.78 --> 5450.34]  and training
[5450.34 --> 5450.96]  in righteousness
[5450.96 --> 5451.94]  so that the
[5451.94 --> 5452.68]  servant of God
[5452.68 --> 5453.46]  may be thoroughly
[5453.46 --> 5453.96]  equipped
[5453.96 --> 5455.00]  for every
[5455.00 --> 5456.20]  good work
[5456.20 --> 5458.44]  now many of us
[5458.44 --> 5458.80]  are familiar
[5458.80 --> 5459.48]  with this text
[5459.48 --> 5460.38]  but hear those
[5460.38 --> 5460.82]  words
[5460.82 --> 5461.90]  those are all
[5461.90 --> 5463.22]  change words
[5463.22 --> 5463.80]  those are all
[5463.80 --> 5465.04]  transform words
[5465.04 --> 5465.18]  right
[5465.18 --> 5466.30]  all of scripture
[5466.30 --> 5468.06]  will teach you
[5468.06 --> 5468.50]  something
[5468.50 --> 5469.78]  will rebuke
[5469.78 --> 5470.08]  you
[5470.08 --> 5470.94]  will correct
[5470.94 --> 5471.26]  you
[5471.26 --> 5471.96]  or train
[5471.96 --> 5472.32]  you in
[5472.32 --> 5472.76]  righteousness
[5472.76 --> 5474.04]  so that you
[5474.04 --> 5475.08]  can be equipped
[5475.08 --> 5476.20]  for every
[5476.20 --> 5476.88]  good work
[5476.88 --> 5479.52]  sometimes
[5479.52 --> 5480.74]  a text
[5480.74 --> 5481.40]  is about
[5481.40 --> 5482.64]  obedience
[5482.64 --> 5483.72]  right
[5483.72 --> 5484.32]  about doing
[5484.32 --> 5484.76]  something
[5484.76 --> 5485.50]  or not
[5485.50 --> 5485.88]  doing
[5485.88 --> 5486.70]  something
[5486.70 --> 5488.04]  sometimes
[5488.04 --> 5488.84]  a text
[5488.84 --> 5489.32]  is about
[5489.32 --> 5490.14]  doxology
[5490.14 --> 5490.52]  about
[5490.52 --> 5491.80]  praising God
[5491.80 --> 5492.48]  for who he
[5492.48 --> 5493.04]  is and
[5493.04 --> 5493.88]  what he has
[5493.88 --> 5494.14]  done
[5494.14 --> 5494.64]  sometimes
[5494.64 --> 5495.18]  a text
[5495.18 --> 5495.84]  is about
[5495.84 --> 5496.30]  mission
[5496.30 --> 5496.58]  about
[5496.58 --> 5497.18]  joining
[5497.18 --> 5497.76]  with God
[5497.76 --> 5498.72]  to reach
[5498.72 --> 5499.30]  those who
[5499.30 --> 5499.68]  do not
[5499.68 --> 5499.88]  yet
[5499.88 --> 5500.66]  know him
[5500.66 --> 5501.58]  sometimes
[5501.58 --> 5502.32]  a text
[5502.32 --> 5502.90]  an application
[5502.90 --> 5504.00]  is about
[5504.00 --> 5505.26]  seeing reality
[5505.26 --> 5505.96]  in the way
[5505.96 --> 5506.44]  that God
[5506.44 --> 5507.46]  has designed
[5507.46 --> 5508.38]  it and reveals
[5508.38 --> 5509.26]  himself through
[5509.26 --> 5510.66]  but the point
[5510.66 --> 5511.32]  is that all
[5511.32 --> 5512.10]  scripture is
[5512.10 --> 5512.94]  God breathed
[5512.94 --> 5513.92]  to change
[5513.92 --> 5514.54]  you from
[5514.54 --> 5515.28]  the inside
[5515.28 --> 5515.92]  out
[5515.92 --> 5516.52]  to change
[5516.52 --> 5516.94]  your mind
[5516.94 --> 5517.38]  to change
[5517.38 --> 5517.78]  your heart
[5517.78 --> 5518.44]  to change
[5518.44 --> 5518.88]  your life
[5518.88 --> 5521.04]  and just
[5521.04 --> 5521.64]  like if you
[5521.64 --> 5522.16]  don't get
[5522.16 --> 5522.70]  to Jesus
[5522.70 --> 5523.28]  through your
[5523.28 --> 5523.88]  Bible study
[5523.88 --> 5525.28]  if you
[5525.28 --> 5526.36]  having seen
[5526.36 --> 5526.94]  Jesus
[5526.94 --> 5529.02]  don't have
[5529.02 --> 5529.44]  your life
[5529.44 --> 5530.10]  transformed
[5530.10 --> 5530.86]  by the power
[5530.86 --> 5531.30]  of the Holy
[5531.30 --> 5531.70]  Spirit
[5531.70 --> 5532.14]  from one
[5532.14 --> 5532.70]  degree of
[5532.70 --> 5532.98]  glory
[5532.98 --> 5533.36]  to the
[5533.36 --> 5533.60]  other
[5533.60 --> 5534.56]  haven't
[5534.56 --> 5534.86]  really
[5534.86 --> 5535.44]  wrestled
[5535.44 --> 5536.40]  the Bible
[5536.40 --> 5537.26]  haven't
[5537.26 --> 5537.48]  really
[5537.48 --> 5537.90]  encountered
[5537.90 --> 5538.66]  the voice
[5538.66 --> 5540.28]  of the
[5540.28 --> 5540.74]  creator
[5540.74 --> 5542.22]  in your
[5542.22 --> 5542.54]  life
[5542.54 --> 5544.76]  so
[5544.76 --> 5545.98]  in our
[5545.98 --> 5546.58]  case study
[5546.58 --> 5547.38]  text then
[5547.38 --> 5548.10]  what is
[5548.10 --> 5548.62]  that call
[5548.62 --> 5549.28]  to action
[5549.28 --> 5549.92]  when you
[5549.92 --> 5550.30]  see the
[5550.30 --> 5550.72]  reality
[5550.72 --> 5551.18]  of Jesus
[5551.18 --> 5551.54]  coming
[5551.54 --> 5551.80]  and the
[5551.80 --> 5552.10]  impact
[5552.10 --> 5552.44]  of Jesus
[5552.44 --> 5552.82]  coming
[5552.82 --> 5554.12]  on reality
[5554.12 --> 5556.56]  you profess
[5556.56 --> 5556.90]  it
[5556.90 --> 5558.46]  right like
[5558.46 --> 5559.12]  Jared and
[5559.12 --> 5559.86]  Hadassah and
[5559.86 --> 5560.28]  Noah you
[5560.28 --> 5561.20]  proclaim it
[5561.20 --> 5562.24]  you live
[5562.24 --> 5562.80]  your life
[5562.80 --> 5563.34]  by it
[5563.34 --> 5564.70]  you worship
[5564.70 --> 5565.64]  God in
[5565.64 --> 5566.32]  it you live
[5566.32 --> 5567.10]  out of it
[5567.10 --> 5567.76]  set free
[5567.76 --> 5568.54]  from the lies
[5568.54 --> 5569.08]  of the devil
[5569.08 --> 5569.74]  and of the
[5569.74 --> 5570.44]  world your
[5570.44 --> 5571.48]  reality now
[5571.48 --> 5572.08]  is marked
[5572.08 --> 5572.60]  out by
[5572.60 --> 5573.50]  relationship
[5573.50 --> 5574.56]  to God
[5574.56 --> 5575.36]  who created
[5575.36 --> 5576.52]  reality
[5576.52 --> 5578.66]  reality
[5578.66 --> 5578.84]  and so
[5578.84 --> 5579.56]  you understand
[5579.56 --> 5580.36]  reality by
[5580.36 --> 5580.64]  it
[5580.64 --> 5582.18]  whether it's
[5582.18 --> 5582.78]  in science
[5582.78 --> 5583.90]  or theology
[5583.90 --> 5585.30]  whether it's
[5585.30 --> 5585.92]  from the pulpit
[5585.92 --> 5586.44]  or in the
[5586.44 --> 5587.00]  sand pit
[5587.00 --> 5588.06]  you proclaim
[5588.06 --> 5588.92]  the reality
[5588.92 --> 5589.68]  of Jesus
[5589.68 --> 5590.72]  in a world
[5590.72 --> 5591.48]  that is
[5591.48 --> 5592.02]  otherwise
[5592.02 --> 5593.00]  blind
[5593.00 --> 5596.92]  so
[5596.92 --> 5598.36]  here
[5598.36 --> 5600.24]  say
[5600.24 --> 5602.96]  your application
[5602.96 --> 5605.38]  you live
[5605.38 --> 5605.70]  it
[5605.70 --> 5606.64]  tomorrow
[5606.64 --> 5608.24]  the next
[5608.24 --> 5609.94]  and forever
[5609.94 --> 5612.18]  profession
[5612.18 --> 5612.78]  of faith
[5612.78 --> 5613.92]  doesn't
[5613.92 --> 5614.50]  stop
[5614.50 --> 5615.34]  when you've
[5615.34 --> 5615.74]  walked off
[5615.74 --> 5616.30]  the stage

[5618.80 --> 5619.36]  of faith
[5619.36 --> 5621.10]  really starts
[5621.10 --> 5622.38]  walk out
[5622.38 --> 5622.78]  these doors
[5622.78 --> 5624.10]  amen
