[0.00 → 4.74] The human life of you and me
[4.74 → 10.40] From the desert sands to the place we stand
[10.40 → 15.76] He is God of all, He is everything
[15.76 → 20.92] I'm giving my life to the only one
[20.92 → 23.98] Who makes the moon reflect the sun
[23.98 → 29.30] Every starry night, that was His design
[29.30 → 32.08] I'm giving my life to the only sun
[32.08 → 35.08] Who was and is and yet to come
[35.08 → 37.92] Let the praises ring
[37.92 → 40.70] The singing is everything
[40.70 → 46.30] The singing is everything
[46.30 → 55.12] From the autumn leaves
[55.12 → 57.96] That will ride the breeze
[57.96 → 60.74] To the faith it takes
[60.74 → 63.34] To pray and see
[63.34 → 66.04] From the painted sky
[66.04 → 68.98] To my plague filled eye
[68.98 → 74.74] He is God of all, He is everything
[74.74 → 79.52] I'm giving my life to the only one
[79.52 → 82.56] Who makes the moon reflect the sun
[82.56 → 87.90] Every starry night, that was His design
[87.90 → 90.68] I'm giving my life to the only sun
[90.68 → 93.58] Who was and is and yet to come
[93.58 → 96.34] Let the praises ring
[96.34 → 101.12] He is everything
[101.12 → 103.62] He is everything
[103.62 → 104.42] Everything
[104.42 → 106.36] Hallelujah
[106.36 → 107.36] Hallelujah
[107.36 → 113.12] I believe
[113.12 → 117.42] Hallelujah
[117.42 → 118.42] Hallelujah
[118.42 → 119.42] Hallelujah
[119.42 → 120.42] Hallelujah
[120.42 → 122.42] Hallelujah
[122.42 → 124.42] I believe
[124.42 → 129.76] I'm giving my life to the only one
[129.76 → 132.74] Who makes the moon reflect the sun
[132.74 → 135.54] On that starry night
[135.54 → 138.08] He changed my life
[138.08 → 140.88] And I'm giving it all to the only sun
[140.88 → 144.28] Who gave me hope when I had none
[144.28 → 146.28] So let the praises ring
[146.28 → 147.28] So let the praises ring
[147.28 → 149.28] Oh let the praises ring
[149.28 → 151.28] I'm giving my life to the only one
[151.28 → 154.28] Who makes the moon reflect the sun
[154.28 → 157.28] Every starry night
[157.28 → 158.28] Every starry night
[158.28 → 159.28] That was His design
[159.28 → 161.28] I'm giving my life to the only sun
[161.28 → 165.28] Who was and is and yet to come
[165.28 → 167.28] Every angel sings
[167.28 → 168.28] Every angel sings
[168.28 → 170.28] That He is heavenly
[170.28 → 172.28] So let the praises ring
[172.28 → 175.28] Because He is everything
[175.28 → 178.28] He is everything
[178.28 → 182.28] Here we go
[182.28 → 192.28] Here we go
[192.28 → 193.28] Here we go
[193.28 → 210.28] I'm casting my cares aside
[210.28 → 214.28] I'm leaving my past behind
[214.28 → 221.28] I'm setting my heart and mind on You, Jesus
[221.28 → 224.28] I'm reaching my hand to You
[224.28 → 226.28] I'm reaching my hand to You
[226.28 → 230.28] I'm leaving with so much more
[230.28 → 237.28] Knowing that all You have in store for me is good
[237.28 → 239.28] It's good
[239.28 → 243.28] Today is the day You have made
[243.28 → 247.28] I will rejoice and be glad in it
[247.28 → 249.28] Today is the day You have made
[249.28 → 253.28] I will rejoice and be glad in it
[253.28 → 258.28] And I won't worry about tomorrow
[258.28 → 261.28] I'm trusting in what You say
[261.28 → 263.28] Today is the day
[263.28 → 265.28] Today is the day
[265.28 → 267.28] Today is the day
[267.28 → 268.28] Today is the day
[268.28 → 270.28] Today is the day
[270.28 → 271.28] Today is the day
[271.28 → 272.28] Today is the day
[272.28 → 274.28] I'm putting my fears aside
[274.28 → 276.28] I'm leaving my doubts behind
[276.28 → 277.28] I'm leaving my doubts behind
[277.28 → 279.28] I'm giving my hopes and dreams to You
[279.28 → 283.88] I'm giving my hopes and dreams to you
[283.88 → 285.40] Jesus
[285.40 → 291.28] I'm pitching my hands to yours
[291.28 → 295.04] Believing in so much more
[295.04 → 302.08] Knowing that all you have in store for me is good
[302.08 → 303.80] It's good
[303.80 → 308.06] Today is the day you have made
[308.06 → 311.82] I will rejoice and be glad in it
[311.82 → 316.04] Today is the day you have made
[316.04 → 319.86] I will rejoice and be glad in it
[319.86 → 324.84] And I won't worry about tomorrow
[324.84 → 327.98] I'm trusting in what you say
[327.98 → 330.62] Today is the day
[330.62 → 333.82] Today is the day
[338.06 → 355.96] I will stand up on your truth
[355.96 → 365.22] I will stand up on your truth
[365.22 → 373.06] And all my days I'll live for you
[373.06 → 380.88] And I will stand up on your truth
[380.88 → 388.82] And all my days I'll live for you
[388.82 → 392.58] And all my days I'll live for you
[392.58 → 395.80] Today is the day you have made
[395.80 → 399.80] I will rejoice and be glad in it
[399.80 → 403.82] Today is the day you have made
[403.82 → 408.08] I will rejoice and be glad in it
[408.08 → 412.80] And I won't worry about tomorrow
[412.80 → 416.56] I'm giving you my fears and sorrows
[416.56 → 420.78] Where you lead me I will follow
[420.78 → 423.54] I'm trusting in what you say
[423.54 → 426.54] Today is the day
[426.54 → 430.20] Today is the day
[430.20 → 434.10] Today is the day
[434.10 → 438.04] Today is the day
[438.04 → 442.04] Today is the day
[442.04 → 454.30] Today is the day
[454.30 → 456.30] Today is the day
[456.30 → 461.30] Today is the day
[461.30 → 486.96] Before I call
[486.96 → 490.00] Before I ever cry
[490.00 → 493.12] You answer me
[493.12 → 496.24] From where the thunder lies
[496.24 → 499.08] I cannot run
[499.08 → 501.82] This heart untethered to
[501.82 → 507.34] Good morning and welcome to church
[507.34 → 510.76] We are so excited to gather together this morning
[510.76 → 511.90] If you are joining us here
[511.90 → 514.44] Welcome into this place together
[514.44 → 515.72] If you are joining us online
[515.72 → 518.84] Welcome to our worship together
[518.84 → 519.74] My name is Chris
[519.74 → 521.58] And I'm one of the pastors here
[521.58 → 522.46] And it's my privilege
[522.46 → 524.08] Along with these others on stage
[524.08 → 525.00] To lead you
[525.00 → 526.96] In our shared worship
[526.96 → 528.58] Of our good God
[528.58 → 530.40] On this Sunday morning
[530.40 → 531.92] Before we begin
[531.92 → 533.08] Just a couple announcements
[533.08 → 534.04] To share with you
[534.04 → 535.22] First
[535.22 → 535.88] An incredible
[535.88 → 537.44] And huge thank you
[537.44 → 538.10] To everyone
[538.10 → 539.08] Who participated
[539.08 → 540.56] In the food drive yesterday
[540.56 → 541.92] It was amazing
[541.92 → 543.98] We had over six pallets of food
[543.98 → 544.80] That we packed up
[544.80 → 545.90] And are shipping over
[545.90 → 547.98] To the Langley Food Bank
[547.98 → 549.02] Now
[549.02 → 550.68] I have not yet
[550.68 → 552.06] Been given permission
[552.06 → 553.16] To share the winner
[553.16 → 556.12] Of the food drive event
[556.12 → 557.40] But I will tell you
[557.40 → 558.30] It was definitive
[558.30 → 560.66] In all three categories
[560.66 → 561.28] Of judgment
[561.28 → 563.94] It was very clear
[563.94 → 565.02] I will also say
[565.02 → 565.80] There was an Easter egg
[565.80 → 566.64] That went out yesterday
[566.64 → 568.34] That might help you figure out
[568.34 → 569.02] Who that was
[569.02 → 570.50] But to know who that is
[570.50 → 571.26] You have to follow me
[571.26 → 572.06] On social media
[572.06 → 576.16] And since my account
[576.16 → 576.58] Is private
[576.58 → 577.50] Maybe you're not
[577.50 → 580.24] Either way
[580.24 → 581.12] It was a great
[581.12 → 582.36] Morning and day
[582.36 → 582.82] Together
[582.82 → 583.80] And we were just
[583.80 → 584.28] So privileged
[584.28 → 585.76] To bless Langley Food Bank
[585.76 → 586.68] In fact
[586.68 → 587.22] We had a few
[587.22 → 588.12] Community members
[588.12 → 589.04] Neighbours of our church
[589.04 → 589.80] Come and check out
[589.80 → 590.42] What we were doing
[590.42 → 591.12] And I interacted
[591.12 → 591.80] With some of them
[591.80 → 593.14] During that time too
[593.14 → 593.96] They participated
[593.96 → 595.02] In their own way
[595.02 → 595.58] And so it was just
[595.58 → 596.00] A blessing
[596.00 → 597.06] To be together
[597.06 → 597.82] And to engage
[597.82 → 598.82] Our community that way
[598.82 → 599.50] And so thank you
[599.50 → 600.22] For that
[600.22 → 600.84] That was great
[600.84 → 602.82] Also just a reminder
[602.82 → 604.84] About the Ask Anything
[604.84 → 605.96] Summer teaching
[605.96 → 606.78] And preaching series
[606.78 → 607.64] That's happening
[607.64 → 609.44] In the Midweek Memo
[609.44 → 610.58] Also on our YouTube channel
[610.58 → 612.14] You can see a video for that
[612.14 → 612.70] And there's a link
[612.70 → 613.68] To a form
[613.68 → 614.58] Where you can fill out
[614.58 → 615.54] And submit your questions
[615.54 → 616.26] And so this is really
[616.26 → 618.14] A chance to ask anything
[618.14 → 619.90] If you've been wondering
[619.90 → 621.12] About something in life
[621.12 → 621.60] And faith
[621.60 → 622.18] Or the Bible
[622.18 → 622.96] Or philosophy
[622.96 → 623.86] Or theology
[623.86 → 625.42] Or Lego
[625.42 → 626.86] Ask anything
[626.86 → 628.78] And we will do our best
[628.78 → 630.62] To answer that here
[630.62 → 631.76] In our series
[631.76 → 632.50] This summer
[632.50 → 634.34] As well
[634.34 → 635.30] You can probably see
[635.30 → 636.10] We have Lord's Supper
[636.10 → 637.10] Later in this service
[637.10 → 637.76] And so if you are
[637.76 → 638.84] Participating at home
[638.84 → 639.78] Be ready for that
[639.78 → 640.40] If you need to get
[640.40 → 640.96] Some elements
[640.96 → 642.74] Ready during our service
[642.74 → 644.06] You can take a moment
[644.06 → 645.08] And grab those things
[645.08 → 645.80] And prepare that
[645.80 → 646.64] So you can participate
[646.64 → 648.12] In our Lord's Supper
[648.12 → 648.52] Together
[648.52 → 649.68] And then finally
[649.68 → 651.06] Tonight there is youth
[651.06 → 652.44] They will be meeting here
[652.44 → 652.96] At the church
[652.96 → 653.86] If you have any questions
[653.86 → 654.64] Or if you're wondering
[654.64 → 655.06] About that
[655.06 → 656.10] You can talk to Pastor Kevin
[656.10 → 657.06] Email him
[657.06 → 657.68] Or text him
[657.68 → 658.40] Or DM him
[658.40 → 659.44] Or however it is
[659.44 → 660.80] And he will address
[660.80 → 661.96] Those for you
[661.96 → 663.62] We gather to worship God
[663.62 → 664.58] And, so I'm going to invite you
[664.58 → 665.20] For those of you
[665.20 → 665.78] Who are here
[665.78 → 666.68] To stand
[666.68 → 667.88] If you're at home
[667.88 → 668.58] You can stand
[668.58 → 669.24] Or you can just
[669.24 → 671.20] Adopt a posture of receipt
[671.20 → 673.16] And as you are standing
[673.16 → 674.98] Because we're in this weird time
[674.98 → 676.38] So as you are standing
[676.38 → 677.98] Means stand now
[677.98 → 678.76] While I'm speaking
[678.76 → 679.34] Very good
[679.34 → 683.60] Because we are still
[683.60 → 684.16] Figuring out
[684.16 → 684.88] What this looks like
[684.88 → 685.70] I just want to tell you
[685.70 → 686.68] That when there comes time
[686.68 → 687.36] In our service
[687.36 → 688.16] For liturgy
[688.16 → 689.22] When you get to say
[689.22 → 691.38] We do God helping us
[691.38 → 692.12] Or when there's a chance
[692.12 → 693.02] For you to respond
[693.02 → 693.88] You can do that
[693.88 → 695.98] In your loud and ordinary voice
[695.98 → 697.02] So that we can hear it
[697.02 → 697.88] In fact
[697.88 → 698.78] Later when I'm preaching
[698.78 → 699.72] And the spirit moves you
[699.72 → 700.44] To shout amen
[700.44 → 701.82] You can do that
[701.82 → 703.38] In your more than loud
[703.38 → 704.48] And ordinary voice
[704.48 → 705.76] So that the people at home
[705.76 → 707.28] Can hear you do that
[707.28 → 708.92] Amen
[708.92 → 709.86] Thank you
[709.86 → 711.36] I'm glad there's one or two
[711.36 → 711.84] Back there
[711.84 → 712.56] I appreciate it
[712.56 → 713.96] Receive the blessing
[713.96 → 714.50] Of our God
[714.50 → 715.60] To start our worship
[715.60 → 716.46] Together
[716.46 → 720.52] Grace
[720.52 → 722.00] Mercy
[722.00 → 723.62] And peace to you
[723.62 → 724.98] From God our Father
[724.98 → 726.16] From the Lord Jesus Christ
[726.16 → 726.72] His Son
[726.72 → 727.84] And our Saviour
[727.84 → 728.82] Through the presence
[728.82 → 729.44] And power
[729.44 → 730.82] Of the Holy Spirit
[730.82 → 732.88] Amen
[732.88 → 735.90] We'll relearn these things
[735.90 → 739.62] Good morning
[739.62 → 740.50] Our call to worship
[740.50 → 740.98] This morning
[740.98 → 742.70] Comes from Psalm 27
[742.70 → 743.74] Where it says
[743.74 → 745.78] One thing I ask
[745.78 → 746.44] From the Lord
[746.44 → 748.10] This only do I seek
[748.10 → 749.64] That I may dwell
[749.64 → 750.34] In the house
[750.34 → 751.10] Of the Lord
[751.10 → 752.68] All the days
[752.68 → 753.36] Of my life
[753.36 → 754.70] To gaze
[754.70 → 755.36] On the beauty
[755.36 → 756.02] Of the Lord
[756.02 → 756.98] And to seek him
[756.98 → 757.96] In his temple
[757.96 → 759.30] For in the day
[759.30 → 759.80] Of trouble
[759.80 → 760.62] He will keep me
[760.62 → 761.74] Safe in his dwelling
[761.74 → 763.10] He will hide me
[763.10 → 763.68] In the shelter
[763.68 → 764.76] Of his sacred tent
[764.76 → 766.04] And set me high
[766.04 → 767.16] Upon the rock
[767.16 → 768.66] Then my head
[768.66 → 769.44] Will be exalted
[769.44 → 770.38] Above the enemies
[770.38 → 771.24] Who surround me
[771.24 → 772.70] At his sacred tent
[772.70 → 773.64] I will sacrifice
[773.64 → 775.42] With shouts of joy
[775.42 → 776.88] I will sing
[776.88 → 778.26] And make music
[778.26 → 779.10] To the Lord
[779.10 → 789.30] You were the word
[789.30 → 791.38] At the beginning
[791.38 → 795.26] Born with God
[795.26 → 799.86] The Lord was taught
[799.86 → 804.32] Of hidden glory
[804.32 → 806.68] In creation
[806.68 → 809.74] Now we've been
[809.74 → 812.38] Built in you

[851.46 → 853.96] Without us
[853.96 → 855.42] So Jesus
[855.42 → 861.12] You brought heaven down
[861.12 → 865.58] My sin was greater

[1107.36 → 1108.92] Lord, hear our prayer.
[1109.92 → 1113.62] For the mending of our hearts torn apart by our unkindness.
[1114.24 → 1118.92] For the healing of our souls wasting away from the surrounding despair.
[1119.56 → 1123.80] For the forgiveness we seek for the sin we have allowed to persist.
[1124.40 → 1128.32] For the reconciliation of the world whose division condemns us.
[1128.96 → 1131.38] We pray for the courage to admit our fault,
[1132.10 → 1134.02] the strength to amend our actions,
[1134.02 → 1137.14] and the hope that your grace awaits us.
[1137.92 → 1140.14] Through Christ we pray. Amen.
[1164.02 → 1165.02] Amen.

[1170.36 → 1172.08] Amen.
[1172.08 → 1175.72] Lord, I want to be a sacrifice.
[1178.22 → 1183.08] Lord, I want to be pleasing to you.
[1183.08 → 1191.42] Lord, I want to love you all my life.
[1191.92 → 1197.48] And be the one that you shine through.
[1197.48 → 1205.18] Jesus, Lord, I give you all.
[1205.18 → 1212.80] Every part of me cries out your name.
[1213.10 → 1218.94] Jesus, I give you all.
[1221.08 → 1223.20] Living and holy.
[1225.08 → 1226.80] Living and holy.
[1228.08 → 1231.68] Living and holy for you.
[1231.68 → 1239.64] Lord, I want to be a sacrifice.
[1239.64 → 1247.38] Lord, I want to be pleasing to you.
[1248.58 → 1254.88] Lord, I want to love you all my life.
[1254.88 → 1256.88] Jesus, I give you all.
[1256.88 → 1261.34] And be the one that you shine through.
[1261.34 → 1268.92] Jesus, I give you all.

[1295.44 → 1303.88] Jesus, I give you all.
[1303.88 → 1311.84] Every part of me cries out your name.
[1311.84 → 1317.84] Jesus, I give you all.
[1317.84 → 1333.80] Living and holy for you.
[1333.80 → 1348.26] If you like to talk to tomatoes.
[1348.26 → 1353.20] If a squash can make you smile.
[1353.76 → 1355.26] If you like to...
[1355.26 → 1355.96] Hi, kids.
[1356.50 → 1357.56] Welcome to Kids Corner.
[1357.70 → 1360.98] It is a journey from that side of the church to this side of the church.
[1360.98 → 1361.98] Let me tell you.
[1361.98 → 1363.98] If I'm a little sweaty, that's probably why.
[1363.98 → 1366.94] It's so good to be with you here today, kids.
[1366.94 → 1369.32] Feel free to come closer to the TV if you're at home.
[1369.32 → 1372.74] Kids in church, it's so good to see so many people here today.
[1372.74 → 1373.38] This is so fun.
[1373.38 → 1377.44] I haven't done this with people in this room before in this sort of capacity.
[1377.44 → 1379.28] So we'll see how this goes.
[1379.28 → 1380.14] I'm sure it'll be great.
[1380.94 → 1386.42] Before we get into the story today, though, we have some special guests here that are going
[1386.42 → 1387.92] to do the memory verse.
[1387.92 → 1392.92] So please take a look at this video.
[1392.92 → 1419.84] Mark 12, verse 30 to 31.
[1419.84 → 1423.08] Excellent work.
[1423.08 → 1425.34] And we have these celebrities in church with us today.
[1425.34 → 1425.94] Well done.
[1425.94 → 1427.14] Well done.
[1427.14 → 1430.12] Claire, Annika, Linda, and Esmé, well done.
[1431.12 → 1435.94] Oh, before we move on, Chris, did you announce this at the beginning of the service, the marathon
[1435.94 → 1437.30] of memory verses?
[1438.04 → 1439.16] Okay, that's my job.
[1439.22 → 1439.98] That's what I've been told.
[1440.08 → 1441.72] So I'm going to share something with you.
[1442.14 → 1443.34] This is for everyone.
[1443.72 → 1447.10] I know this is Kids Corner, and sometimes we think it's all about kids, but this is for
[1447.10 → 1448.94] fully grown grown-ups as well.
[1448.94 → 1452.88] We are doing the Emanuel Marathon of memory verses.
[1453.14 → 1453.86] It's something like that.
[1453.92 → 1454.72] I can't remember exactly.
[1454.82 → 1455.44] It's a tongue twister.
[1456.16 → 1460.90] But what that means is you can come to the church, or you can send Mrs. Nikki a video
[1460.90 → 1464.94] of you doing all nine of the memory verses this year.
[1464.94 → 1469.70] And if you can do that, you'll notice in the foyer there is this table full of prizes.
[1470.10 → 1471.14] There's candy.
[1471.50 → 1473.56] There's gift cards for the grown-ups.
[1473.86 → 1476.96] There's like Joan's soda and like birdhouses.
[1477.36 → 1478.66] And there are all sorts of things.
[1478.96 → 1480.04] There are kites, I think.
[1480.04 → 1484.34] So come to the church and recite your memory verses.
[1484.46 → 1485.50] We've been doing them all year.
[1485.60 → 1487.68] They're on the pre-show slides going through.
[1487.78 → 1491.84] So if you don't know what they are, re-watch church today, and you'll see all those slides.
[1492.40 → 1495.32] Or watch old churches, because we've been doing them for nine months.
[1495.78 → 1497.12] So do those memory verses.
[1497.28 → 1497.94] Come get a prize.
[1498.06 → 1500.14] Let's see if you know the memory verses we've all learned.
[1500.14 → 1502.08] Now, we're going to get into our story today.
[1502.18 → 1504.24] But before we do that, I've got a special guest.
[1511.40 → 1512.52] It's Hank the Hound, everyone.
[1512.62 → 1513.14] Say hi to Hank.
[1515.82 → 1519.48] What is going on?
[1520.08 → 1521.16] There's people here today, Hank.
[1521.54 → 1522.20] Isn't it exciting?
[1522.68 → 1523.74] I don't know.
[1524.34 → 1525.82] I don't know about this.
[1526.72 → 1529.20] I don't know if I like this so much it makes me nervous.
[1529.20 → 1530.26] Oh, really?
[1530.44 → 1532.18] I don't know if I like people here.
[1532.50 → 1532.74] Really?
[1533.44 → 1537.60] It's so exciting, though, Hank, which reminds me, unrelated, I should introduce you to Linda afterwards.
[1537.70 → 1538.26] Remind me to do that.
[1538.36 → 1538.58] Okay.
[1539.24 → 1542.04] Why are you so nervous that there's people here?
[1542.70 → 1546.04] Um, I get nervous speaking in front of people.
[1546.68 → 1548.08] Oh, that's a very common thing.
[1548.14 → 1549.20] You know what I was told once?
[1549.62 → 1550.34] What helps?
[1550.56 → 1551.10] What's that?
[1551.44 → 1555.32] If you picture everyone in your underwear, that helps you not to be so nervous.
[1555.80 → 1556.84] Okay, let's try.
[1559.20 → 1565.12] Did that not work?
[1565.38 → 1565.74] No.
[1566.22 → 1570.20] Okay, well then stop doing that and let's just pretend it's you and me, and it'll go fine, okay?
[1570.52 → 1570.88] Okay.
[1571.32 → 1574.66] We're going to read a story today about Saul.
[1575.20 → 1575.82] Who's that?
[1575.94 → 1577.62] Well, you might know him better as Paul.
[1578.16 → 1579.18] Oh, Paul.
[1579.50 → 1581.40] Yeah, we're going to learn about how he became Paul.
[1581.46 → 1582.10] Does that sound good?
[1582.34 → 1582.64] Yeah.
[1582.64 → 1583.66] Okay, so let's do that.
[1583.90 → 1584.78] I've got the book here.
[1585.22 → 1586.78] You're going to help me open it as usual, right, Hank?
[1586.98 → 1587.26] Mm-hmm.
[1589.76 → 1593.38] Good job, Hank.
[1594.60 → 1595.10] All right.
[1596.18 → 1597.06] Here's the story.
[1597.78 → 1598.88] You can see the picture at home.
[1598.94 → 1599.46] Do you see that?
[1600.00 → 1600.50] Everybody here?
[1600.60 → 1601.90] It's very far away, but it's there.
[1601.98 → 1602.30] See that?
[1602.30 → 1604.42] So, this is called Saul.
[1604.72 → 1605.12] Saul.
[1605.46 → 1605.94] Here we go.
[1606.82 → 1609.00] I'm so smart and important.
[1609.40 → 1612.72] Saul thought he had travelled to Damascus as he travelled to Damascus.
[1613.34 → 1617.42] Saul was a well-known Jewish religious teacher, and he was very proud.
[1617.86 → 1621.26] He was also someone who was feared by those who followed Jesus.
[1621.64 → 1622.20] Oh, no.
[1622.20 → 1627.76] On this trip, like so many times before, he was on his way to get rid of people who followed
[1627.76 → 1628.10] Jesus.
[1628.64 → 1630.68] But God had other plans.
[1631.76 → 1635.72] Suddenly, a bright white light shot from the heaven and blinded Saul.
[1635.88 → 1639.08] I can't see, Saul yelled as he stumbled to the ground.
[1639.86 → 1641.50] Saul, why do you hate me?
[1641.70 → 1643.08] Said a deep, booming voice.
[1643.86 → 1644.92] Who are you, Lord?
[1645.26 → 1646.00] Saul asked.
[1646.46 → 1648.10] I'm Jesus, the voice answered.
[1648.56 → 1651.42] Go to the city of Damascus and wait for me there.
[1652.42 → 1655.82] Saul waited in Damascus, terribly afraid and unable to see.
[1656.34 → 1658.34] But Jesus did not leave him without help.
[1658.78 → 1661.00] He sent his friend Ananias to Saul.
[1661.68 → 1663.38] Lay your hands on him, Jesus said.
[1663.54 → 1666.68] I want Saul to see and be filled with my Holy Spirit.
[1667.32 → 1669.96] So Ananias put his hands on Saul's head.
[1670.34 → 1673.40] Something that looked like fish scales fell from Saul's eyes.
[1673.80 → 1674.28] Wow!
[1674.64 → 1676.34] And he could see again.
[1676.98 → 1680.60] All at once, Jesus' spirit filled his heart with love and joy.
[1681.44 → 1686.26] Saul, the one who hated Jesus, became one of Jesus' most famous followers.
[1686.80 → 1688.46] The disciple named Paul.
[1688.96 → 1689.44] Wow!
[1690.00 → 1691.04] Isn't that a cool story?
[1691.32 → 1691.66] Yeah!
[1692.00 → 1693.34] What stands out to you in that story?
[1693.62 → 1695.66] I can't believe he went blind!
[1696.06 → 1697.54] That is crazy that he went blind.
[1697.62 → 1699.32] I mean, that would have helped you out this morning, wouldn't it?
[1699.32 → 1700.10] He went, mm-hmm.
[1701.44 → 1704.14] But I don't think Saul liked it so much.
[1704.26 → 1704.90] Do you think so?
[1705.10 → 1705.98] I don't think so.
[1706.16 → 1707.00] You know what I think is cool?
[1707.28 → 1709.48] Do you know what he had to do right after he became blind?
[1709.86 → 1710.18] What?
[1710.58 → 1712.32] He had to go to church.
[1712.78 → 1716.78] He had to go to a church and meet a pastor, essentially, Ananias.
[1716.94 → 1718.12] And that was his first thing.
[1718.18 → 1722.86] So he went to this town and Ananias prayed over him and put his hands on him.
[1723.28 → 1724.70] And then he was healed of his blindness.
[1725.26 → 1725.62] Wow!
[1725.90 → 1726.78] That is cool!
[1727.48 → 1728.54] That's how God works, right?
[1728.58 → 1729.66] He works through people.
[1729.86 → 1731.18] And so that's a good story about that.
[1731.26 → 1733.26] And then God worked through Paul.
[1734.00 → 1738.04] So Paul could write all those letters to all the churches in the area.
[1738.36 → 1739.08] That's neat!
[1739.74 → 1740.10] All right.
[1740.16 → 1743.64] So we're going to have children's worship time today for you at church today.
[1743.64 → 1746.58] And if you're at home, I know that you've got some crafts and stuff that you can do.
[1746.70 → 1749.30] So feel free to pull those out and start doing those.
[1749.66 → 1752.70] And if you're in church today, after I pray, you can go to children's worship time.
[1752.82 → 1757.58] So I think the older crowd is going with Mrs. Dolores in the multipurpose room.
[1757.62 → 1761.80] And the younger ones are going to the other side of the church there with Mrs. Wendy, I believe.
[1761.98 → 1763.80] So you can head there as soon as I pray.
[1763.88 → 1764.30] Should we pray?
[1764.54 → 1764.80] Yeah!
[1765.04 → 1765.46] Let's pray.
[1766.70 → 1768.02] Dear God, thank you so much for this day.
[1768.02 → 1771.84] Thank you for church, that we could come here and that you work through your people, God.
[1771.84 → 1776.70] Thank you for the story of Saul and Paul and how you changed his heart and that he could
[1776.70 → 1779.42] be used for your glory so many times, Lord.
[1779.44 → 1782.64] We just pray that you will help us be that courageous as well.
[1783.28 → 1789.18] You change our hearts if it needs changing and allow us to really go out and share your
[1789.18 → 1790.32] love with those around us.
[1790.40 → 1791.30] We pray this in your name.
[1791.70 → 1791.94] Amen.
[1792.44 → 1792.96] Say bye, Hank.
[1793.16 → 1793.76] Bye, Hank!
[1793.76 → 1794.70] Bye, everyone.
[1801.84 → 1825.16] So good morning.
[1826.12 → 1829.72] We continue our worship offerings this morning.
[1829.72 → 1834.82] Today's offering is for the budget, which supports the ministry of this church.
[1835.36 → 1837.66] And our special offering is for Teen Challenge.
[1838.74 → 1843.64] Teen Challenge strives to help men and women recover from substance abuse problems and is
[1843.64 → 1848.86] based on the belief that a relationship with God through Jesus is the only way to find permanent
[1848.86 → 1850.52] and lasting freedom.
[1850.52 → 1858.00] So as such, Teen Challenge is a Christian discipleship program, which transformation and not treatment
[1858.00 → 1858.58] is the key.
[1859.72 → 1866.52] Jesus said, come to me, all you who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
[1867.66 → 1871.80] And through supporting Teen Challenge, we speak this truth into broken lives.
[1873.36 → 1876.12] Next week, our offering will be for World Renew Canada.
[1877.12 → 1882.10] When disaster strikes, World Renew responds through its Disaster Response Service.
[1882.10 → 1886.60] Currently, World Renew is responding to the COVID-19 crises in India.
[1887.82 → 1892.66] So today, we have the budget and Teen Challenge and the next week, World Renew.
[1893.30 → 1894.42] Please give generously.
[1912.10 → 1925.08] Pastor Ambrose is on the Global Renewal is root formability and the basis of COVID-19, and patient
[1925.08 → 1925.66] is the next week.
[1925.66 → 1929.82] The World Renew is on the basis for becoming a part that occurs.
[1929.82 → 1932.40] So there is also about every single year before people stay looked at the NHS fouls and the
[1932.40 → 1933.90] signing working on users.
[1933.90 → 1934.84] Basically, chemical Dinah will make a difference.
[1934.84 → 1936.04] So let's go a second week.
[1936.04 → 1937.82] лекramanda.com
[1937.82 → 1954.32] Good morning.
[1957.90 → 1961.42] We are going to come into prayer here in a moment.
[1961.42 → 1968.38] And I wanted to share a few words with you here this morning.
[1969.44 → 1972.00] And if I choke up, I apologize beforehand.
[1972.74 → 1979.06] But you will recall a few years ago in church here,
[1979.14 → 1985.88] we had a time when we were able to share some of our favourite songs.
[1987.34 → 1990.56] And I certainly felt the Lord tugging at my heart that time.
[1990.56 → 1993.72] And there was a song that was close to my heart.
[1994.84 → 1997.58] And we will be singing it later this morning.
[1998.86 → 2001.06] And here I am leading you in prayer.
[2001.20 → 2005.98] And I always think, wow, the Lord has a hand in everything.
[2007.60 → 2009.22] You know, and here I was in the kitchen,
[2010.04 → 2014.36] preparing the elements for the Lord's table this morning.
[2016.00 → 2019.30] And I hear the worship team singing, abide with me.
[2020.56 → 2028.66] Needless to say, you never know when your emotions hit high or low or where they go.
[2028.78 → 2031.74] But the tears were flowing, let me tell you.
[2031.82 → 2036.44] So if the bread tastes a little salty this morning, I apologize.
[2036.44 → 2045.96] And, you know, I will just give you a real abbreviated form of what I was mentioning or telling you a few years ago.
[2046.04 → 2051.90] But whether you believe it or not, and Wendy, my wife, has a hard time with this,
[2051.90 → 2053.28] but I am an introvert.
[2054.78 → 2056.76] And I really am.
[2056.92 → 2060.46] And you will see generally I like to be in the back of the room.
[2060.54 → 2067.66] I'm not one who likes to speak, but I have, I'm going to say I'm thankful the Lord has gifted me with that.
[2069.06 → 2070.78] Yet I'd rather be silent.
[2070.78 → 2074.38] And so I am by myself.
[2074.50 → 2075.90] I enjoy the times alone.
[2076.00 → 2078.20] I enjoy the times with my wife incredibly.
[2078.40 → 2080.84] But being by myself is wonderful.
[2081.66 → 2085.14] And in my line of work also when I was younger, as a young man,
[2085.20 → 2088.86] I was out in the field plowing and risking land and so on.
[2090.32 → 2091.30] Always singing.
[2091.50 → 2093.42] Music was always close to my heart.
[2093.42 → 2097.64] And so I sang the song, Abide With Me.
[2097.74 → 2102.60] And I always thought if I'm by myself, if there's one person I want with me, it's my Lord.
[2103.66 → 2106.58] And I remember singing that song over and over.
[2106.78 → 2108.94] And in those days sometimes it was just the first few lines.
[2109.00 → 2109.90] That was all I knew.
[2110.32 → 2113.36] And then later on I thought, I wrote it on paper.
[2114.94 → 2118.24] And while I'm travelling across this country for business,
[2119.44 → 2122.38] so often I had that paper on the seat beside me.
[2122.38 → 2125.94] And while I'm driving I would look over and see the words and then sing the song.
[2125.98 → 2126.96] And I sang that over and over.
[2127.02 → 2130.80] And then I had to rewrite the music because the paper was so worn out.
[2131.22 → 2133.66] Today, thankfully, it's on here.
[2133.78 → 2137.80] And I just pop it out on the phone, and you read the words and sing.
[2140.62 → 2145.04] And then of course, almost 16 years ago,
[2147.04 → 2151.16] while I was in Toronto, I got that phone call.
[2152.40 → 2155.38] That our son David had passed away.
[2157.20 → 2162.54] In his sleep here at home and totally, totally unexpected.
[2162.54 → 2171.48] and I was doing about 110 kilometres an hour down the NEW,
[2173.04 → 2176.90] actually coming home, going to my hotel room from church that Sunday morning.
[2177.82 → 2180.50] And I remember hitting the steering wheel so hard,
[2181.50 → 2183.28] I thought I had broken the car.
[2184.68 → 2188.82] And then I pulled out that song, out of my briefcase, and I started singing.
[2189.66 → 2192.26] And within hours, I was on the plane back home,
[2192.54 → 2196.78] and they put me in business class all by myself,
[2197.86 → 2203.88] and I pulled that paper out, sang it, I read it over and over,
[2203.94 → 2207.28] and the tears were flowing, and when I left, the paper stayed on the table
[2207.28 → 2211.72] because it was so wet that I couldn't really peel it off anymore.
[2214.40 → 2218.16] And so every time I hear, not every time, but most times when we sing that song,
[2218.16 → 2222.08] when I hear that song, it really tugs at my heart and creates tears.
[2223.16 → 2227.50] And then there are other songs that tug you at other times for other occasions.
[2227.50 → 2233.18] But when I hear that song, and we sing that song, certainly these times come very clear to me,
[2233.28 → 2235.52] especially my introverted ness.
[2236.48 → 2239.80] And I just thought I would share that with you.
[2239.86 → 2242.32] We're going to be singing Abide With Me later on in the service today,
[2242.32 → 2246.54] and so I thought I would just want to share this testimony with you.
[2247.40 → 2253.50] As we come to the Lord in prayer, I want to bring a couple of things to note here.
[2253.94 → 2261.86] This past week, Bob Kiss had his first chemo treatment for lymphoma cancer,
[2261.86 → 2266.72] and indications are the first treatment went well for him,
[2266.78 → 2270.08] and we pray that there may be continued healing for him.
[2270.82 → 2274.12] Janet Boot has some health concerns as well,
[2274.12 → 2278.18] and she will be going in for a scan tomorrow,
[2278.18 → 2281.52] and we need to keep her in our prayers as well.
[2281.60 → 2288.16] And Dismay, she also had some gallstones and a kidney stone in the last couple of days,
[2288.22 → 2292.38] and she's in a rather fair amount of pain in the hospital,
[2292.52 → 2294.04] and they're dealing with that and the inflammation,
[2294.38 → 2299.00] and so she will be going under surgery later this week as well,
[2299.52 → 2301.06] as soon as the inflammation comes down.
[2301.06 → 2304.16] Shall we come before the Lord in prayer?
[2308.74 → 2316.66] Heavenly Father, we are here as your people, as your children,
[2317.48 → 2325.28] and Lord, we give you thanks for allowing us to be here together this morning to worship,
[2325.90 → 2330.06] and Lord, may we also worship with those who are at home,
[2330.06 → 2332.30] watching on their screens.
[2332.84 → 2335.40] We thank you, Lord, for that technology as well,
[2335.50 → 2338.64] and even though it may not be quite what we want,
[2339.64 → 2345.80] it does bring us together in virtual ways, and we thank you.
[2347.28 → 2350.46] And Lord, as we worship this morning in word and in song,
[2350.58 → 2354.28] we pray, Lord, that you would accept the words that we speak.
[2354.28 → 2360.66] And Lord, as we sing in our hearts, may that to be meaningful.
[2365.36 → 2369.30] And Lord, even if we are not able to hold back the words,
[2371.48 → 2374.28] we pray, Lord, that you may find that acceptable also.
[2374.28 → 2381.14] And yet, Lord, may we come here because we are a broken people.
[2384.86 → 2388.02] Lord, we have fallen short so often this past week,
[2388.06 → 2393.50] and we come before you this morning asking, Lord, for your spirit to work within us,
[2394.06 → 2399.68] to lead us and guide us in our daily lives so that we may be honouring you in all things.
[2399.68 → 2407.28] And Lord, each day again we pray that there are those around us who may see that you live in us,
[2408.22 → 2412.32] that we may be a shining light in this community, ourselves, individually,
[2412.46 → 2418.44] but also, Lord, as a church, may we too be a light to those around us,
[2418.52 → 2420.74] to the community that surrounds us here.
[2420.74 → 2426.28] And Lord, we pray that through the food drive that we had yesterday also,
[2426.46 → 2434.26] that, Lord, may that to speak boldly and clearly to those around us here,
[2434.36 → 2437.70] that they may see there is something different happening here.
[2440.02 → 2445.98] And that, Lord, as you bless us incredibly, may we too bless those around us who have less.
[2450.74 → 2455.90] Lord, we know there are others who struggle also.
[2457.46 → 2462.42] Within our own family here are also those in the community at large and further abroad.
[2462.60 → 2465.84] Lord, we want to remember the indigenous peoples of our country.
[2467.46 → 2477.18] Lord, as they try to continue to understand and deal with the children that have passed away many years ago in residential homes,
[2477.18 → 2485.46] Lord, may we too struggle with that and try to understand, Lord, how you want us to deal with that.
[2485.54 → 2491.04] May we be bold about that and speak clearly through you, Lord,
[2491.12 → 2499.18] that we too may be able to help in ways that we may not even know are imaginable at this time.
[2499.18 → 2508.62] Lord, in our own community, we have many who struggle.
[2509.64 → 2514.74] And Lord, you know them by name and may we too speak them by name also.
[2514.92 → 2519.36] And yet we know that we will forget some and perhaps not mention others.
[2521.68 → 2523.16] Yet, Lord, you know them.
[2523.74 → 2525.74] Lord, we pray for Janet.
[2525.74 → 2534.24] Lord, we pray that the issues that she might be dealing with may be healed.
[2534.36 → 2539.68] We pray for Bob Kiss that his cancer too may go away.
[2540.18 → 2542.44] We know, Lord, that you are the creator of all miracles.
[2542.68 → 2546.94] And we pray that here too, Lord, you would bring a miracle to Bob's life.
[2546.94 → 2556.12] Lord, we pray for Dismay that she too may be healed of her stones and the pain that she is going through.
[2559.32 → 2566.22] Lord, we thank you for John and Pearl that John's health also may be on the increase.
[2567.34 → 2571.36] Lord, he too is healing from his heart attack that he had some time ago.
[2571.36 → 2583.34] Lord, we pray for Mark Kisser that her surgery may go well this coming week also on her foot.
[2583.58 → 2585.28] We pray for Judy and Diane, Lord.
[2585.48 → 2593.58] We have prayed years for them, and we still know, Lord, and believe that you will create miracles of healing in their lives.
[2593.58 → 2604.88] And Lord, there are others within our family that struggle with isolation and other COVID issues, perhaps.
[2607.98 → 2609.92] May each one experience healing.
[2611.62 → 2616.32] We pray for those in our community, Lord, who are working on our behalf.
[2616.82 → 2623.20] Trying to bring healing to the many who are dealing with health issues.
[2623.58 → 2629.16] Lord, we pray for our church as we continue to minister.
[2630.20 → 2632.88] Lord, we thank you that we are able to gather here again.
[2633.88 → 2638.48] And we pray that in due time we may come together as a family.
[2642.32 → 2646.22] Lord, we pray for the programs that continue to go.
[2646.22 → 2648.76] And we pray for the church staff.
[2649.52 → 2653.18] Chris, Kevin, Josh, and others, Lord.
[2653.18 → 2657.58] And the staff in the offices, Lord, who work here each day.
[2658.48 → 2659.56] Bless them in their work.
[2659.82 → 2660.38] Guide them.
[2663.96 → 2669.22] Lord, we pray that as we worship you this morning also, that as Pastor Chris leads us through your word,
[2669.34 → 2672.70] you would give him the words that need to be spoken.
[2672.70 → 2675.12] And we pray, Lord, for hearts that may be opened.
[2676.24 → 2683.08] May hear, take, and accept the words that go from the Lord.
[2683.14 → 2685.40] We pray that we may all be drawn closer to you.
[2687.92 → 2689.98] We ask for a blessing on this service, Lord.
[2690.04 → 2691.10] In your name we pray.
[2691.52 → 2691.88] Amen.
[2702.70 → 2709.28] We're going to spend some time in God's word together.
[2709.98 → 2712.96] We're going to look at a story from Mark.
[2713.02 → 2715.94] It may be a very familiar story to you.
[2716.06 → 2718.40] And so we're going to dig into what that means.
[2718.54 → 2722.82] So if you have a Bible, either in your hands or on your device, whatever the case may be,
[2722.82 → 2725.72] I'm going to encourage you to grab it, turn it on, open it up.
[2725.96 → 2729.92] Mark 2, we're going to read verse 1 through 12.
[2729.92 → 2731.80] Mark 2, we're going to read verse 1 through 12.
[2732.70 → 2739.22] Hear the word of the Lord from Mark 2.
[2741.50 → 2745.88] A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum,
[2746.54 → 2748.80] the people heard that he had come home.
[2750.24 → 2754.60] They gathered in such large numbers that there was no room left,
[2755.42 → 2757.46] not even outside the door.
[2758.46 → 2761.02] And he preached the word to them.
[2762.70 → 2767.66] Some men came, bringing to him a paralyzed man carried by four of them.
[2769.02 → 2771.80] And since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd,
[2772.00 → 2775.42] they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging through it
[2775.42 → 2778.66] and then lowered the mat the man was laying on.
[2780.26 → 2784.86] When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man,
[2784.86 → 2788.20] Son, Son, your sins are forgiven.
[2790.40 → 2793.80] Now, some of the teachers of the law were sitting there thinking to themselves,
[2793.96 → 2796.40] Why does this fellow talk like that?
[2796.54 → 2798.30] He is blaspheming.
[2798.64 → 2801.26] Who can forgive sins but God alone?
[2802.94 → 2808.08] And immediately, Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts.
[2808.08 → 2808.90] And he said to them,
[2808.90 → 2811.42] Why are you thinking these things?
[2811.82 → 2814.68] Which is easier, to say to the paralyzed man,
[2814.80 → 2816.04] Your sins are forgiven,
[2816.30 → 2817.38] or to say,
[2817.54 → 2820.10] Get up, take your mat, and walk?
[2821.50 → 2826.82] But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.
[2826.82 → 2829.32] And so he said to the man,
[2830.46 → 2832.00] I tell you, get up.
[2833.10 → 2835.16] Take your mat and go home.
[2836.38 → 2840.86] He got up, he took his mat, and he walked out in full view of them all.
[2841.38 → 2844.72] This amazed everyone, and they praised God, saying,
[2845.22 → 2848.58] We have never seen anything like this.
[2849.70 → 2851.28] This is the word of the Lord.
[2856.82 → 2861.26] So like we said, this is a really familiar story to many of us.
[2861.82 → 2865.50] Its pages paint children's Bibles for generations.
[2865.50 → 2872.52] And in this story, what Jesus reveals to us is a collision of need.
[2873.16 → 2879.84] The collision of need between the physical realities that people face and live in the midst of
[2879.84 → 2885.30] and the spiritual realities that we live as consequence in.
[2885.30 → 2895.34] The story is a collision of need, and it asks us to wonder together about our own priorities.
[2895.90 → 2900.46] To wonder together about what really matters.
[2902.16 → 2903.44] Now here you have Jesus.
[2903.68 → 2909.22] He returns to Capernaum, which in his ministry sort of becomes his home base.
[2909.46 → 2911.60] You hear that people say he has returned home.
[2911.98 → 2914.72] So Capernaum, which is on the north of the Sea of Galilee,
[2914.72 → 2920.30] is the place where the Sermon on the Mount, for instance, was thought to have been preached.
[2921.30 → 2926.20] And so Jesus comes to Capernaum, and he is known here.
[2926.46 → 2928.82] And so he packs them in for preaching.
[2928.94 → 2931.18] No physical distancing rules apply.
[2931.76 → 2936.86] He packs them in such that these four men who come with their friend who has been paralyzed for life
[2936.86 → 2938.26] cannot get to him.
[2938.26 → 2940.60] They cannot break through the crowds.
[2941.92 → 2945.04] And so because they couldn't get through, they went up.
[2945.04 → 2952.56] And then going up, likely to the flat roof of the house that Jesus had found himself in,
[2952.62 → 2954.86] which probably would have had stairs going up the side,
[2954.94 → 2959.38] because in the summer months they would have slept on the roof out of doors,
[2959.38 → 2963.34] because it was cooler than sleeping in the box that was the small house.
[2963.72 → 2968.76] And so they would have gone up, and they start digging through the clay and tile roof
[2968.76 → 2972.50] in order to make an opening for Jesus to come down.
[2972.60 → 2976.74] So to get to Jesus, these four men demolish a house.
[2979.08 → 2982.92] Just out of curiosity's sake, when was the last time you demolished a house,
[2983.52 → 2987.06] literally or metaphorically, to get to Jesus?
[2987.06 → 2995.10] These four men knew where they needed to go and to whom they needed to go,
[2995.24 → 2996.72] and so they tore down the roof.
[2999.42 → 3005.12] When Jesus saw their faith, now get that, he says their faith.
[3005.22 → 3009.40] So when Jesus sees the faith of the four men who had torn down the roof,
[3009.40 → 3012.74] he says to the other, to the paralyzed one,
[3013.22 → 3016.16] son, your sins are forgiven.
[3017.90 → 3019.58] And so quick, just as a point here,
[3019.64 → 3025.76] if you've ever doubted the importance or the power of the faith of your brothers and sisters for your life,
[3026.92 → 3028.10] hear this story.
[3029.44 → 3034.22] Our faith matters for you individually.
[3037.22 → 3044.56] Our faith carries one into the presence of Jesus.
[3044.56 → 3047.14] Jesus says,
[3047.14 → 3050.98] son, your sins are forgiven.
[3052.64 → 3054.10] And of course, the teachers of the law,
[3054.50 → 3055.72] their minds are blown,
[3055.90 → 3058.08] they're flabbergasted and offended, right?
[3058.18 → 3059.28] Who is this man?
[3060.90 → 3063.56] Now this actually does make sense, right?
[3063.62 → 3066.42] That only God can forgive sins.
[3066.42 → 3072.84] Only the person sinned against can forgive the action committed, right?
[3072.94 → 3078.20] Forgiveness can only be offered by the one against whom the sin has been committed.
[3078.40 → 3081.94] And so Jesus, at this moment, is saying two things, right?
[3081.94 → 3082.82] By forgiving sins.
[3082.94 → 3085.90] One, he's saying, this is ultimately against me.
[3086.38 → 3090.28] Two, Jesus at this moment is saying, I am God.
[3090.28 → 3092.82] The Father and I are one.
[3093.22 → 3095.24] Who can forgive sins but God alone?
[3095.58 → 3097.32] Jesus says, exactly.
[3099.90 → 3101.28] He knows their hearts.
[3101.98 → 3104.26] And he reads their hearts.
[3104.50 → 3107.66] And he knows their desires and their will and their thoughts.
[3107.90 → 3109.70] And so he says to these teachers of the law,
[3109.80 → 3111.36] what's easier to say,
[3111.72 → 3112.92] your sins are forgiven,
[3113.26 → 3115.32] or get up, take your mat and walk.
[3115.32 → 3120.52] Now when I was younger and when I read this text,
[3120.52 → 3123.64] I always thought that that was a rhetorical device
[3123.64 → 3126.78] because of course it's easier to say your sins are forgiven.
[3126.96 → 3130.92] But the reality is, of course, is that Jesus' word is his power, right?
[3130.96 → 3132.00] And so it's neither.
[3132.90 → 3134.40] Neither one is easier to say
[3134.40 → 3137.50] because Jesus is literally, by saying your sins are forgiven,
[3137.64 → 3138.32] forgiving sins.
[3138.40 → 3140.20] And by saying, get up and take your mat and walk,
[3140.42 → 3142.12] having the power and authority to do that.
[3142.18 → 3143.82] So neither is easier.
[3143.82 → 3146.52] His words have power.
[3147.66 → 3148.16] And then Jesus,
[3148.28 → 3149.78] and this is one of the reasons why this story
[3149.78 → 3151.28] is one of my absolute favourite
[3151.28 → 3152.34] and has been for years
[3152.34 → 3155.52] because really this is just a boss moment for Jesus, right?
[3155.60 → 3156.00] He says,
[3156.36 → 3158.54] but that you may know that the Son of Man
[3158.54 → 3160.52] has power to forgive sins.
[3160.84 → 3162.42] And then he turns to the paralyzed man
[3162.42 → 3163.76] who had been lowered down,
[3163.84 → 3166.10] who the whole time hasn't said anything in this story.
[3166.44 → 3167.84] He says, I tell you, get up.
[3168.98 → 3169.66] Take your mat.
[3171.30 → 3171.96] Go home.
[3173.82 → 3177.22] And then boom, immediately he gets up.
[3177.32 → 3179.58] He rolls up that mat, and he walks out the door.
[3179.86 → 3182.28] That crowd that was pushing in and pressing in
[3182.28 → 3184.04] and that made it impossible for him to get there
[3184.04 → 3186.10] just spreads apart.
[3187.36 → 3188.34] And he walks right through,
[3190.28 → 3193.50] praising and worshipping God.
[3193.56 → 3195.72] And they amazed everyone, and they praised God,
[3195.82 → 3199.42] saying, we have never seen anything like this.
[3199.42 → 3202.70] This is a story of collision of need,
[3202.82 → 3204.58] physical and spiritual.
[3204.70 → 3208.18] This is a story of Jesus going way down deep
[3208.18 → 3210.98] to the real problem.
[3212.46 → 3213.62] But here it is, right?
[3213.68 → 3216.22] For us, it's so easy to think
[3216.22 → 3220.86] that the big problem is the one right in front of us.
[3220.86 → 3225.18] Whether that's poverty or hunger or sex trafficking
[3225.18 → 3226.54] or COVID-19,
[3226.90 → 3228.60] whether that's not having the right clothes
[3228.60 → 3229.54] or the right car,
[3229.82 → 3232.64] whether it's a disability or a health issue.
[3232.82 → 3235.84] But Jesus is saying effectively here,
[3236.22 → 3238.90] don't miss the forest for the trees.
[3240.70 → 3241.78] David Platt,
[3242.40 → 3245.70] he has a quote on this passage
[3245.70 → 3246.52] that I think is beautiful.
[3246.52 → 3247.18] He says,
[3247.86 → 3249.18] the man's ultimate need,
[3249.26 → 3250.16] his ultimate need,
[3250.30 → 3251.80] is not healing from God,
[3251.90 → 3254.04] but holiness before God.
[3255.00 → 3256.06] Our ultimate need
[3256.06 → 3258.46] is not to be rid of our maladies,
[3258.56 → 3261.88] but reconciled to our maker.
[3265.64 → 3268.74] There's a children's book series.
[3269.12 → 3270.54] You're probably familiar with it,
[3270.56 → 3272.26] or at least one book of the series.
[3272.38 → 3273.46] In the Chronicles of Narnia,
[3273.46 → 3275.94] you might know The Lion,
[3276.06 → 3276.88] the Witch, and the Wardrobe.
[3277.62 → 3279.32] There's another book in that series
[3279.32 → 3280.50] written by C.S. Lewis
[3280.50 → 3283.34] called The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.
[3284.16 → 3284.60] And in that,
[3284.84 → 3287.60] there's a story of this boy named Eustacy.
[3287.88 → 3290.60] Now, Eustacy is a real snob of a kid.
[3291.68 → 3292.92] There are other words I would use
[3292.92 → 3294.08] if this wasn't being recorded.
[3295.48 → 3296.66] He hates everybody,
[3296.78 → 3298.44] and everybody hates him.
[3298.52 → 3299.98] He is mean and vindictive
[3299.98 → 3301.44] and cuttingly sarcastic,
[3301.44 → 3304.86] and he's travelling with his cousins
[3304.86 → 3307.62] and this group of Narnia ns on a ship.
[3307.78 → 3308.04] And this,
[3308.58 → 3310.46] the travellers come up to an island,
[3310.86 → 3313.36] and Eustacy walks off on his own
[3313.36 → 3315.50] because he's angry and upset with them,
[3315.62 → 3317.72] and he stumbles across a cave.
[3317.94 → 3318.96] And in this cave,
[3319.08 → 3321.76] there's this massive pile of treasure.
[3324.10 → 3326.62] And he sees this pile of treasure
[3326.62 → 3328.72] of gold and jewels and the like,
[3328.72 → 3330.78] and he thinks of all the things
[3330.78 → 3332.22] that he will be able to do
[3332.22 → 3333.88] with these riches.
[3334.06 → 3335.74] He thinks of all the revenge
[3335.74 → 3337.40] he will be able to met out,
[3337.48 → 3338.48] of all the mean things
[3338.48 → 3339.62] that he will be able to do.
[3339.80 → 3341.76] And he spends so much time
[3341.76 → 3343.86] thinking about all of these things
[3343.86 → 3345.42] that he ends up falling asleep
[3345.42 → 3347.24] on this pile of treasure.
[3348.06 → 3349.04] And what you find out
[3349.04 → 3350.60] as the reader of this story
[3350.60 → 3353.12] is that Eustacy has fallen asleep
[3353.12 → 3354.52] on a dragon's hoard.
[3354.52 → 3357.54] Now the next morning,
[3358.20 → 3359.68] because he fell asleep,
[3359.80 → 3360.36] Lewis says,
[3360.76 → 3362.36] thinking dragonish thoughts
[3362.36 → 3363.60] of lust and pride,
[3363.84 → 3365.54] he wakes up to find himself
[3365.54 → 3367.42] turned into a dragon.
[3368.56 → 3370.16] And after trying to find a way
[3370.16 → 3371.48] to change himself back,
[3371.66 → 3373.08] the truth that he is going to be
[3373.08 → 3373.86] a dragon forever
[3373.86 → 3375.62] begins to set in on his heart.
[3376.76 → 3378.34] Now as he's returning to the ship
[3378.34 → 3380.00] as a dragon,
[3380.16 → 3382.06] he comes across a lion
[3382.06 → 3383.56] named Aslan.
[3384.52 → 3386.16] This is the great lion of Narnia.
[3386.28 → 3387.20] It's the Christ figure
[3387.20 → 3388.20] in the series.
[3388.34 → 3390.58] And Aslan approaches Eustacy,
[3390.64 → 3391.68] who's still a dragon,
[3391.68 → 3393.82] and he leads him to a pool of water
[3393.82 → 3395.10] and he tells him
[3395.10 → 3396.60] that he must undress
[3396.60 → 3398.08] and jump into the water.
[3399.42 → 3401.22] And so Eustacy begins to pull
[3401.22 → 3403.80] and to claw at his scaly flesh,
[3404.14 → 3406.72] to pull bits of dragon skin off.
[3406.76 → 3407.56] And he works at it
[3407.56 → 3408.30] and he works at it
[3408.30 → 3408.88] and he works at it
[3408.88 → 3409.62] and he thinks he's
[3409.62 → 3410.66] accomplishing something.
[3410.66 → 3412.10] And when he looks
[3412.10 → 3413.58] and works and turns around,
[3413.70 → 3416.30] he sees this pile of dragon skin
[3416.30 → 3417.42] beside himself,
[3417.62 → 3418.48] like a snake
[3418.48 → 3420.16] having shed its skin.
[3421.46 → 3423.26] But as he looks down at himself,
[3423.52 → 3424.76] much to his own dismay
[3424.76 → 3426.30] and tragedy,
[3427.06 → 3427.84] he's still a dragon.
[3429.22 → 3430.20] And so he tries again
[3430.20 → 3431.26] and again and again
[3431.26 → 3432.70] and it's always the same result.
[3432.80 → 3436.12] A small pile of shed dragonish skin,
[3436.32 → 3438.26] but still a dragon.
[3438.26 → 3440.86] So Aslan approaches him
[3440.86 → 3441.58] and he says,
[3442.08 → 3443.72] you're going to have to let me
[3443.72 → 3445.18] go deeper.
[3449.10 → 3450.36] Eustacy later returns
[3450.36 → 3451.60] to his companions
[3451.60 → 3452.78] as a boy again
[3452.78 → 3454.78] and he describes this event,
[3454.88 → 3455.32] what happened.
[3456.08 → 3456.86] And this is what he says.
[3458.62 → 3460.66] This is Eustacy's testimony.
[3460.66 → 3464.08] I was afraid of his claws,
[3464.30 → 3465.14] I could tell you,
[3465.58 → 3467.40] but I was pretty nearly desperate now.
[3468.54 → 3469.90] Now the very first tear
[3469.90 → 3471.46] that he made was so deep
[3471.46 → 3472.72] that I thought it had gone
[3472.72 → 3474.66] right to my heart.
[3475.70 → 3478.10] And when he began pulling the skin off,
[3478.22 → 3480.28] it hurt worse than anything
[3480.28 → 3481.24] I'd ever felt.
[3482.14 → 3484.20] Well, he peeled that beastly stuff
[3484.20 → 3484.88] right off,
[3485.10 → 3487.12] just as I thought I'd done it myself
[3487.12 → 3488.16] the other three times,
[3488.16 → 3489.58] only they hadn't hurt.
[3490.44 → 3492.50] And there was lying on the grass
[3492.50 → 3494.54] only ever so much,
[3495.94 → 3497.60] only ever so much thicker
[3497.60 → 3498.32] and darker
[3498.32 → 3499.76] and more knobbly looking
[3499.76 → 3500.76] than the others had been.
[3501.76 → 3503.44] And then he caught hold of me
[3503.44 → 3505.30] and he threw me into the water
[3505.30 → 3507.30] and it smarted like anything,
[3507.88 → 3509.04] but only for a moment.
[3509.32 → 3510.54] And then I had saw
[3510.54 → 3513.38] I had turned into a boy again.
[3513.38 → 3516.20] Like Eustacy,
[3516.44 → 3519.68] we need to let Jesus go deeper.
[3520.78 → 3522.94] We need to let Jesus be our Saviour,
[3523.08 → 3523.98] to let him take us
[3523.98 → 3525.30] to the heart of the matter.
[3525.42 → 3526.48] No longer can we hide
[3526.48 → 3527.84] behind things and desires
[3527.84 → 3530.20] because we see them as they are,
[3530.26 → 3530.40] right?
[3530.66 → 3532.78] Dragonish realities of lust
[3532.78 → 3534.94] and pride and idolatry.
[3535.48 → 3536.64] Jesus has come
[3536.64 → 3538.30] and so he tells the paralytic
[3538.30 → 3539.00] and he tells you
[3539.00 → 3539.82] and he tells me
[3539.82 → 3541.76] and he comes to give us
[3541.76 → 3542.78] new hearts
[3542.78 → 3543.98] and new lives.
[3544.98 → 3545.08] Right?
[3545.14 → 3545.82] This is the work
[3545.82 → 3546.64] that is celebrated
[3546.64 → 3547.70] in baptism
[3547.70 → 3548.96] and in just a moment
[3548.96 → 3550.22] in the Lord's Supper
[3550.22 → 3551.82] as we take that together,
[3551.94 → 3552.12] right?
[3552.16 → 3552.70] That Jesus,
[3552.96 → 3555.00] by his perfect life,
[3555.32 → 3557.04] by his death in our place
[3557.04 → 3558.84] and by the sure victory over sin
[3558.84 → 3559.78] that is marked
[3559.78 → 3560.92] by his resurrection,
[3561.34 → 3562.38] that this Jesus
[3562.38 → 3564.64] gives us a new identity,
[3566.06 → 3566.60] an identity
[3566.60 → 3567.68] which holds him
[3567.68 → 3568.68] at the core,
[3568.68 → 3569.46] an identity
[3569.46 → 3570.52] that's no longer ruled
[3570.52 → 3571.18] by sin
[3571.18 → 3572.42] but by gratitude.
[3572.42 → 3573.30] It's an identity
[3573.30 → 3575.04] that comes to the table
[3575.04 → 3575.68] this morning
[3575.68 → 3577.60] hungry for Jesus.
[3579.98 → 3581.08] God himself
[3581.08 → 3583.62] in the life of his son
[3583.62 → 3585.22] has reconciled
[3585.22 → 3586.24] and restored
[3586.24 → 3587.28] relationship
[3587.28 → 3588.54] with us.
[3590.70 → 3592.02] This is the truth
[3592.02 → 3593.56] of this collision
[3593.56 → 3594.84] of need
[3594.84 → 3596.28] in the second half
[3596.28 → 3596.80] of our text
[3596.80 → 3597.68] when the teachers
[3597.68 → 3598.40] of the law
[3598.40 → 3599.66] heard all that Jesus
[3599.66 → 3600.50] had said.
[3600.58 → 3600.76] They said,
[3600.84 → 3601.80] he's blaspheming.
[3602.06 → 3603.10] Who can forgive sins
[3603.10 → 3603.92] but God alone?
[3604.10 → 3605.26] To which Jesus replies,
[3605.40 → 3605.56] right,
[3605.64 → 3606.12] exactly.
[3606.32 → 3607.72] Who can forgive sins
[3607.72 → 3608.76] but God alone?
[3609.30 → 3609.46] Right?
[3609.50 → 3609.74] And here,
[3609.82 → 3610.50] Jesus is showing
[3610.50 → 3611.82] that he is God.
[3611.92 → 3612.26] He's showing
[3612.26 → 3613.62] that he is the only one
[3613.62 → 3614.84] who can fulfill
[3614.84 → 3615.82] our deepest desires.
[3615.96 → 3617.00] He is the only one
[3617.00 → 3617.82] who can cut
[3617.82 → 3618.54] to the heart
[3618.54 → 3619.18] of the matter.
[3619.28 → 3620.22] He is the only one
[3620.22 → 3621.44] who can lead us
[3621.44 → 3623.10] into these baptismal waters
[3623.10 → 3624.04] and raise us up
[3624.04 → 3624.86] with a new heart.
[3624.86 → 3625.96] He is the only one
[3625.96 → 3626.68] who can fulfill
[3626.68 → 3628.26] our deepest longings
[3628.26 → 3629.02] and heal
[3629.02 → 3630.54] our perennial discontent.
[3630.78 → 3631.90] He is the only one
[3631.90 → 3632.70] who can overcome
[3632.70 → 3633.98] lust and pride
[3633.98 → 3634.70] and idolatry.
[3635.00 → 3636.88] He is the miracle worker,
[3637.18 → 3637.80] a healer,
[3637.92 → 3639.20] and he is more
[3639.20 → 3640.22] than a means
[3640.22 → 3640.90] to an end.
[3640.90 → 3642.90] He is the end itself.
[3643.68 → 3644.90] He is our Saviour.
[3645.86 → 3648.32] He is your Saviour.
[3649.56 → 3650.70] By his death,
[3650.86 → 3651.72] we have life.
[3652.02 → 3652.10] Right?
[3652.14 → 3653.38] He's more than just
[3653.38 → 3654.48] the means to fulfill
[3654.48 → 3655.54] our deepest longings.
[3655.74 → 3659.06] He is our deepest longings.
[3661.20 → 3662.22] Someone needs to hear
[3662.22 → 3662.92] that this morning.
[3664.18 → 3667.32] Jesus is your deepest longing.
[3669.38 → 3670.50] You've been looking.
[3670.74 → 3671.50] You've been working.
[3671.72 → 3672.96] You've been trying.
[3673.34 → 3674.12] But it all keeps
[3674.12 → 3674.92] coming up short.
[3675.98 → 3676.16] Right?
[3676.18 → 3676.88] It's all fleeting.
[3677.12 → 3678.60] It all eventually goes away.
[3678.78 → 3680.00] It all returns to normal.
[3680.26 → 3681.40] Hurt and apathy,
[3681.40 → 3683.02] brokenness returns.
[3683.18 → 3684.36] No matter how many times
[3684.36 → 3684.96] you try,
[3685.18 → 3686.10] no matter how many times
[3686.10 → 3687.24] it feels for a moment
[3687.24 → 3688.32] like you've got hold of it,
[3688.46 → 3689.62] you open your hands
[3689.62 → 3690.68] and they're still empty.
[3691.28 → 3693.82] Jesus is your deepest longing.
[3695.28 → 3695.46] Right?
[3695.50 → 3696.96] We spend lifetimes looking
[3696.96 → 3698.16] in all the wrong places,
[3698.52 → 3700.18] but Jesus is the answer.
[3700.54 → 3701.16] He is it.
[3701.40 → 3703.24] He is what your heart needs.
[3703.24 → 3706.66] The problem is
[3706.66 → 3709.20] that all that other stuff
[3709.20 → 3710.56] has built walls up
[3710.56 → 3712.16] around your heart.
[3712.28 → 3713.16] All that other stuff
[3713.16 → 3713.64] has
[3713.64 → 3718.22] made us dragons.
[3720.02 → 3721.40] All that other stuff
[3721.40 → 3722.22] is sin.
[3723.34 → 3723.44] Right?
[3723.64 → 3724.38] Sin is
[3724.38 → 3725.48] the problem,
[3725.64 → 3727.36] the real problem,
[3727.50 → 3729.24] the way down deep problem.
[3729.44 → 3730.62] Sin is what keeps us
[3730.62 → 3731.90] separated from Jesus.
[3731.90 → 3733.16] Sin is what keeps us
[3733.16 → 3734.32] from the true longing
[3734.32 → 3735.20] of our heart,
[3735.26 → 3735.86] which is Him.
[3737.06 → 3738.30] And in this story,
[3739.08 → 3740.74] Jesus does the miracle
[3740.74 → 3743.00] of healing the man's paralysis
[3743.00 → 3744.82] that He might show
[3744.82 → 3746.08] that He has the power
[3746.08 → 3747.26] to forgive sins.
[3747.56 → 3747.64] Right?
[3747.66 → 3748.84] The greater reality,
[3749.02 → 3749.82] the greater need,
[3749.92 → 3750.62] the deeper need
[3750.62 → 3751.82] is the forgiveness
[3751.82 → 3753.22] of sins.
[3753.86 → 3754.86] The Bible tells us
[3754.86 → 3755.72] over and over
[3755.72 → 3756.60] and over again
[3756.60 → 3758.78] that Jesus does miracles
[3758.78 → 3759.78] in order to,
[3759.88 → 3760.86] as Hebrews 2 says,
[3760.86 → 3762.48] confirm the testimony
[3762.48 → 3763.20] about Him.
[3764.18 → 3764.32] Right?
[3764.48 → 3766.14] Miracles authenticate.
[3766.28 → 3767.32] They validate
[3767.32 → 3768.12] the message
[3768.12 → 3769.50] of who Jesus is.
[3770.58 → 3771.74] The miracles aren't meant
[3771.74 → 3773.30] for the miracle's sake.
[3774.00 → 3774.84] They aren't even meant
[3774.84 → 3776.72] for the recipient's sake.
[3776.80 → 3776.94] Right?
[3777.00 → 3777.86] The healed ones,
[3777.94 → 3778.42] though, of course,
[3778.50 → 3780.08] their lives are dramatically changed
[3780.08 → 3780.84] and we praise God
[3780.84 → 3781.68] for that.
[3782.00 → 3782.10] Right?
[3782.16 → 3783.12] Jesus' miracles
[3783.12 → 3784.48] are so that people
[3784.48 → 3785.44] will know
[3785.44 → 3786.74] that what He says,
[3786.82 → 3787.82] what He preaches,
[3788.66 → 3789.30] is true.
[3789.30 → 3790.54] That what He says
[3790.54 → 3791.18] about Himself
[3791.18 → 3792.24] is accurate
[3792.24 → 3793.48] and real.
[3794.56 → 3794.72] Right?
[3794.78 → 3796.84] He is the Son of God,
[3796.94 → 3797.50] God Himself,
[3797.68 → 3798.22] second person
[3798.22 → 3799.56] of the Divine Trinity.
[3799.76 → 3800.86] He is the Messiah,
[3801.00 → 3801.72] the Anointed One,
[3801.82 → 3802.24] the Saviour,
[3802.38 → 3803.36] who lived the life
[3803.36 → 3804.04] I should have lived
[3804.04 → 3804.88] and died the death
[3804.88 → 3805.68] that I deserved,
[3805.78 → 3806.88] who three days later
[3806.88 → 3807.76] was raised
[3807.76 → 3809.06] from the dead
[3809.06 → 3809.74] in victory,
[3809.88 → 3810.80] who has ascended
[3810.80 → 3811.56] to the right hand
[3811.56 → 3812.06] of the Father
[3812.06 → 3812.74] and is seated
[3812.74 → 3814.74] at the right hand
[3814.74 → 3815.16] of God,
[3815.22 → 3815.76] and from there
[3815.76 → 3816.32] He will come
[3816.32 → 3817.16] to judge the living
[3817.16 → 3817.66] and the dead.
[3817.72 → 3818.98] That this same Jesus
[3818.98 → 3819.74] with the Father
[3819.74 → 3821.06] has sent the Spirit
[3821.06 → 3821.96] so that you might
[3821.96 → 3822.86] know Him
[3822.86 → 3825.02] and that by the person
[3825.02 → 3826.02] of the Holy Spirit,
[3826.12 → 3827.16] the person of the Son
[3827.16 → 3828.28] lives in you
[3828.28 → 3829.10] by grace
[3829.10 → 3830.56] through faith
[3830.56 → 3831.48] if you believe.
[3832.78 → 3833.80] And that this same Jesus
[3833.80 → 3835.92] is coming back
[3835.92 → 3836.86] and He will make
[3836.86 → 3838.12] all things new
[3838.12 → 3839.08] and there will be
[3839.08 → 3839.90] no more death
[3839.90 → 3840.94] or crying
[3840.94 → 3841.54] or pain
[3841.54 → 3842.36] for the old order
[3842.36 → 3842.86] of things
[3842.86 → 3844.00] has passed away.
[3844.00 → 3845.54] The miracles of Jesus
[3845.54 → 3847.38] prove all of those
[3847.38 → 3848.30] things true
[3848.30 → 3850.04] when He says them.
[3851.84 → 3852.22] Now,
[3852.94 → 3854.90] when we hear that,
[3855.82 → 3857.12] some of you
[3857.12 → 3857.94] start to wonder,
[3858.94 → 3860.40] well, what about today?
[3861.78 → 3862.48] And how come we don't
[3862.48 → 3864.08] see miracles like that
[3864.08 → 3865.22] today to confirm
[3865.22 → 3866.30] who Jesus is?
[3867.58 → 3868.34] And so I want to
[3868.34 → 3868.82] address that.
[3869.46 → 3870.34] And as we wade
[3870.34 → 3870.82] into this,
[3870.88 → 3871.76] I want us to be
[3871.76 → 3873.02] very intentional
[3873.02 → 3874.10] and bring our best
[3874.10 → 3875.36] thinking to bear
[3875.36 → 3875.76] on it.
[3875.78 → 3876.14] And so I'm going
[3876.14 → 3877.18] to say three things
[3877.18 → 3878.22] and I'm happy to follow
[3878.22 → 3879.04] up with any conversation
[3879.04 → 3879.46] you want.
[3880.46 → 3881.16] But first,
[3881.46 → 3881.92] number one,
[3882.28 → 3883.40] when you hear people
[3883.40 → 3884.90] say we don't see
[3884.90 → 3886.44] miracles today,
[3886.60 → 3887.60] for some of you,
[3887.70 → 3889.04] that's just not true.
[3890.54 → 3890.72] Right?
[3890.76 → 3891.96] You've seen miracles.
[3892.38 → 3893.36] You've had miraculous
[3893.36 → 3894.46] healings or prayers
[3894.46 → 3895.80] answered in ways
[3895.80 → 3896.28] that are just
[3896.28 → 3897.24] inexplicable
[3897.24 → 3898.40] apart from God
[3898.40 → 3899.40] directly acting
[3899.40 → 3900.28] and intervening
[3900.28 → 3900.92] in your life.
[3901.76 → 3902.72] And all around,
[3902.72 → 3903.66] global Christianity,
[3903.66 → 3904.68] there are stories
[3904.68 → 3906.18] of amazing displays
[3906.18 → 3907.94] of God's glorifying,
[3908.18 → 3910.18] self-authenticating power.
[3911.70 → 3912.78] Now, of course,
[3913.78 → 3916.88] there are liars
[3916.88 → 3918.12] and there are cheats
[3918.12 → 3919.08] and there are so-called
[3919.08 → 3919.82] faith healers
[3919.82 → 3920.86] who take advantage
[3920.86 → 3922.06] of people's desperation.
[3922.56 → 3923.46] And there are churches
[3923.46 → 3924.50] traditions as well
[3924.50 → 3925.78] that put an unhealthy
[3925.78 → 3927.48] emphasis on experiencing
[3927.48 → 3928.92] things like this
[3928.92 → 3929.94] such that these things
[3929.94 → 3931.28] are called miracles
[3931.28 → 3931.90] that probably
[3931.90 → 3933.14] really aren't.
[3934.14 → 3934.26] Right?
[3934.30 → 3935.66] And as faithful Christians,
[3935.66 → 3937.70] we can be skeptical
[3937.70 → 3938.90] and discerning
[3938.90 → 3940.04] about this sort of things.
[3940.40 → 3940.78] In fact,
[3940.94 → 3941.92] the scriptures call us
[3941.92 → 3943.08] to discern false prophets,
[3943.22 → 3944.00] to discern the wolves
[3944.00 → 3944.48] among us,
[3944.50 → 3946.70] to identify antichrists
[3946.70 → 3947.88] in 1 John 2.
[3947.88 → 3950.34] All that being said,
[3950.80 → 3952.12] I really believe
[3952.12 → 3953.30] that there are probably
[3953.30 → 3953.98] more miracles
[3953.98 → 3954.94] happening in the world
[3954.94 → 3956.62] today than you realize,
[3957.72 → 3959.96] especially from the comfort
[3959.96 → 3961.12] of our 21st century
[3961.12 → 3963.28] Western affluent lives.
[3964.88 → 3965.46] Second,
[3966.18 → 3967.10] let me question
[3967.10 → 3967.76] the presumption
[3967.76 → 3969.90] that seeing more miracles
[3969.90 → 3971.56] would lead more people
[3971.56 → 3972.12] to believe.
[3972.12 → 3975.22] I remember one time
[3975.22 → 3976.38] I was talking
[3976.38 → 3976.98] with someone
[3976.98 → 3978.10] who had just come back
[3978.10 → 3979.22] from a trip
[3979.22 → 3980.04] at a camp
[3980.04 → 3981.70] where they were sort of
[3981.70 → 3983.92] like the camp volunteers,
[3984.16 → 3984.86] the camp parents
[3984.86 → 3986.26] who would help serve
[3986.26 → 3987.26] all the kids
[3987.26 → 3987.72] who were there
[3987.72 → 3988.22] for the week.
[3989.00 → 3989.80] And there was a girl
[3989.80 → 3991.28] who had an accident
[3991.28 → 3992.54] and was in a wheelchair.
[3993.46 → 3994.72] And at a chapel service,
[3994.96 → 3996.08] they prayed for her
[3996.08 → 3997.28] and for her pain
[3997.28 → 3998.86] and they prayed for healing,
[3999.46 → 4000.56] but she wasn't healed.
[4000.56 → 4002.66] And that person
[4002.66 → 4003.50] came to me later
[4003.50 → 4004.12] and said,
[4004.58 → 4005.40] I don't get it.
[4006.24 → 4006.98] It's like God
[4006.98 → 4007.80] didn't want
[4007.80 → 4009.16] these people to believe.
[4009.52 → 4010.76] If God had healed her
[4010.76 → 4011.30] at that moment,
[4011.40 → 4012.34] all of those people there
[4012.34 → 4012.98] would have believed.
[4013.24 → 4013.84] They would have been left
[4013.84 → 4015.00] without any excuse.
[4017.10 → 4017.94] But here's the thing.
[4019.58 → 4020.62] That way of thinking
[4020.62 → 4022.06] and that reality
[4022.06 → 4023.56] wasn't true in Jesus' day.
[4024.98 → 4026.32] So why would it be true in ours?
[4027.26 → 4029.60] Jesus did countless miracles,
[4029.60 → 4030.76] more than are recorded
[4030.76 → 4031.56] in Scripture,
[4031.70 → 4032.52] John tells us, right?
[4032.70 → 4034.62] That he did all of these things
[4034.62 → 4038.42] and so few people believed them.
[4038.86 → 4040.32] Only the tiniest fraction
[4040.32 → 4042.54] of people believed.
[4043.30 → 4044.12] So why do we assume
[4044.12 → 4044.78] that it would be different
[4044.78 → 4046.34] in our day and for us?
[4046.38 → 4046.98] Because honestly,
[4047.40 → 4048.44] human nature is still the same.
[4049.12 → 4050.28] I don't think it would be.
[4052.82 → 4053.78] Third, third,
[4053.98 → 4054.50] this is three,
[4054.50 → 4055.86] and most important.
[4056.42 → 4057.26] The major difference
[4057.26 → 4058.42] between then and now,
[4058.50 → 4059.92] and this is especially true
[4059.92 → 4061.34] in our context, right?
[4061.38 → 4062.60] In the modern West
[4062.60 → 4063.52] with a long history
[4063.52 → 4064.36] of Christian teaching
[4064.36 → 4065.82] and presence, right?
[4066.58 → 4067.84] Even if that long history
[4067.84 → 4068.58] of Christian teaching
[4068.58 → 4068.98] and presence
[4068.98 → 4071.78] is largely comprehensively rejected
[4071.78 → 4072.36] or dismissed
[4072.36 → 4073.40] by so many people today,
[4073.54 → 4074.84] the reality for us,
[4074.92 → 4075.28] of course,
[4075.34 → 4077.86] is that we have the Bible,
[4078.64 → 4078.84] right?
[4078.86 → 4079.70] More prolifically
[4079.70 → 4080.62] than ever before
[4080.62 → 4081.90] because even if you don't have
[4081.90 → 4083.04] a Bible in your hands right now,
[4083.04 → 4083.70] you have your phone
[4083.70 → 4084.38] in your pocket
[4084.38 → 4085.88] and you can get it.
[4086.22 → 4086.48] In fact,
[4086.52 → 4087.86] you can get like 60 translations
[4087.86 → 4090.42] like that, right?
[4090.44 → 4092.84] We have the very words of God
[4092.84 → 4094.42] written by the Holy Spirit,
[4094.56 → 4096.06] true and infallible,
[4096.16 → 4096.98] the only source
[4096.98 → 4098.06] and the highest authority
[4098.06 → 4099.32] for life and faith, right?
[4099.54 → 4100.86] The Apostle Paul
[4100.86 → 4101.60] makes this clear
[4101.60 → 4102.32] in Romans 10
[4102.32 → 4103.16] and in Ephesians 6
[4103.16 → 4104.12] and 2 Timothy 3
[4104.12 → 4106.06] and Peter in 2 Peter, right?
[4106.08 → 4107.32] And Jesus confirms it
[4107.32 → 4108.20] in our text
[4108.20 → 4109.60] as it's his word
[4109.60 → 4111.48] that forgives and heals, right?
[4111.48 → 4114.28] The priority is on the word.
[4116.54 → 4117.62] Put it simply,
[4118.24 → 4119.64] we don't need miracles
[4119.64 → 4120.58] in the same way
[4120.58 → 4121.30] to authenticate
[4121.30 → 4122.14] the witness of Jesus
[4122.14 → 4124.08] because we have the word
[4124.08 → 4125.96] which authenticates
[4125.96 → 4127.94] the witness of Jesus.
[4129.50 → 4130.78] The purpose of Jesus' miracles
[4130.78 → 4131.74] is to confirm
[4131.74 → 4132.48] the testimony
[4132.48 → 4133.82] about Jesus himself.
[4134.00 → 4134.74] What is the purpose
[4134.74 → 4135.30] of the Bible,
[4135.40 → 4136.36] the word, right?
[4136.42 → 4137.86] Jesus answers this for us
[4137.86 → 4138.58] in John 5.
[4138.94 → 4140.22] Jesus says to the Pharisees
[4140.22 → 4140.64] and teachers,
[4141.04 → 4142.08] you study the scriptures
[4142.08 → 4143.52] diligently because you think
[4143.52 → 4144.20] that in them
[4144.20 → 4145.60] you have eternal life.
[4146.06 → 4147.56] These are the very scriptures
[4147.56 → 4150.86] that testify about me.
[4151.80 → 4154.04] Yet you refuse to come to me
[4154.04 → 4156.14] and have life.
[4156.72 → 4157.94] But Jesus says this word
[4157.94 → 4160.02] is the testimony about him.
[4160.16 → 4162.08] Luke writes that all the law
[4162.08 → 4162.64] and the prophets
[4162.64 → 4163.54] are about Jesus.
[4163.80 → 4165.14] Jesus says that heaven
[4165.14 → 4166.28] and earth will pass away
[4166.28 → 4167.34] but my words
[4167.34 → 4169.12] will never pass away.
[4169.42 → 4171.02] John 14 is all about
[4171.02 → 4172.58] the authority of Jesus' word
[4172.58 → 4174.80] as speaking the Father's word,
[4175.04 → 4175.18] right?
[4175.22 → 4176.32] The word of the Lord
[4176.32 → 4178.02] endures forever.
[4178.54 → 4179.30] The Bible,
[4179.42 → 4180.08] the whole thing
[4180.08 → 4181.48] from cover to cover
[4181.48 → 4183.18] reveals who Jesus is
[4183.18 → 4184.62] and the Holy Spirit
[4184.62 → 4186.94] as he works through the word
[4186.94 → 4188.60] confirms that truth
[4188.60 → 4189.68] in your heart.
[4189.68 → 4192.38] What's more,
[4193.14 → 4194.14] the sacraments,
[4194.96 → 4195.36] baptism,
[4196.00 → 4196.68] and Lord's Supper
[4196.68 → 4198.10] and the regular actions
[4198.10 → 4198.66] of worship
[4198.66 → 4200.58] centred around the word
[4200.58 → 4203.68] confirm who Jesus is.
[4205.36 → 4206.38] Let me ask you
[4206.38 → 4207.16] the hard question here.
[4208.30 → 4209.72] How often do we long
[4209.72 → 4211.38] for God's word?
[4211.92 → 4213.54] How deeply do we desire
[4213.54 → 4214.76] to see Jesus
[4214.76 → 4216.64] on these pages?
[4216.84 → 4218.46] Do we long for him here
[4218.46 → 4219.42] in the Bible?
[4219.52 → 4220.84] Do we long for him here
[4220.84 → 4221.84] in worship,
[4222.00 → 4223.20] here or online,
[4223.60 → 4225.48] like we long for a miracle?
[4228.68 → 4231.08] If we don't desire deeply
[4231.08 → 4232.32] to commune with God
[4232.32 → 4233.02] in his word
[4233.02 → 4234.20] and in our worship,
[4234.44 → 4235.70] how can we suppose
[4235.70 → 4237.20] to ever see him act
[4237.20 → 4238.52] in miracles?
[4240.20 → 4241.36] Do you pray
[4241.36 → 4242.22] to see Jesus
[4242.22 → 4243.38] show up in power
[4243.38 → 4244.36] through the word
[4244.36 → 4246.10] as often as you pray
[4246.10 → 4247.04] for healing
[4247.04 → 4248.16] or for God to help?
[4248.46 → 4251.84] in this age,
[4251.90 → 4253.26] in the age of the church,
[4253.54 → 4254.92] what is clear
[4254.92 → 4257.38] is that God's primary way
[4257.38 → 4258.22] of communicating
[4258.22 → 4259.32] with his people
[4259.32 → 4261.18] is through the word.
[4262.16 → 4264.18] The first and normative way
[4264.18 → 4265.26] God reveals himself
[4265.26 → 4266.82] is through the Bible.
[4267.68 → 4268.58] And when we ask
[4268.58 → 4269.62] for something more,
[4269.80 → 4270.82] for a miracle,
[4271.12 → 4272.04] but we are unwilling
[4272.04 → 4273.16] to approach God
[4273.16 → 4275.14] and to seek him
[4275.14 → 4276.60] as he has ordained,
[4276.60 → 4279.42] we probably shouldn't
[4279.42 → 4280.26] be surprised
[4280.26 → 4281.68] when we don't see him
[4281.68 → 4282.42] show up in power
[4282.42 → 4283.60] in the way that we want
[4283.60 → 4285.02] because we are looking
[4285.02 → 4286.24] or we're starting to look
[4286.24 → 4287.60] in the wrong places.
[4289.70 → 4290.44] Here's the thing
[4290.44 → 4291.56] about Christian faith
[4291.56 → 4293.14] for us today.
[4293.98 → 4295.26] It's true for the Israelites.
[4295.70 → 4296.80] It's true for the apostles.
[4297.48 → 4298.34] It's true for us.
[4298.34 → 4300.62] The Christian faith
[4300.62 → 4301.98] looks back
[4301.98 → 4302.84] on the promises
[4302.84 → 4304.40] of God fulfilled
[4304.40 → 4305.16] in history
[4305.16 → 4306.48] to fuel
[4306.48 → 4307.30] a hope
[4307.30 → 4308.28] from God
[4308.28 → 4309.84] about a glorious future
[4309.84 → 4311.30] so that the present
[4311.30 → 4312.58] can be endured
[4312.58 → 4313.82] with joy
[4313.82 → 4314.72] regardless
[4314.72 → 4315.60] of
[4315.60 → 4316.46] your
[4316.46 → 4317.60] circumstances.
[4318.28 → 4319.64] Let me say that again.
[4320.30 → 4321.48] The Christian faith
[4321.48 → 4322.50] looks back
[4322.50 → 4323.32] on the promises
[4323.32 → 4324.36] of God fulfilled
[4324.36 → 4325.00] in history
[4325.00 → 4325.98] to fuel
[4325.98 → 4326.48] a hope
[4326.48 → 4327.38] from God
[4327.38 → 4328.68] about a glorious future
[4328.68 → 4329.82] so that the present
[4329.82 → 4330.76] can be endured
[4330.76 → 4331.92] with joy
[4331.92 → 4332.94] regardless
[4332.94 → 4335.18] of your circumstances.
[4336.40 → 4337.48] This book,
[4337.60 → 4338.46] this amazing,
[4338.86 → 4339.32] powerful,
[4339.56 → 4340.48] miraculous book
[4340.48 → 4341.36] tells you
[4341.36 → 4342.06] the story
[4342.06 → 4342.78] of promises
[4342.78 → 4343.42] fulfilled
[4343.42 → 4344.36] in the past.
[4344.50 → 4344.98] It tells you
[4344.98 → 4345.52] the story
[4345.52 → 4346.44] of a hope
[4346.44 → 4347.14] to come
[4347.14 → 4348.08] and it tells you
[4348.08 → 4349.18] how to endure
[4349.18 → 4350.32] and persevere
[4350.32 → 4351.26] right now
[4351.26 → 4352.32] as a disciple
[4352.32 → 4353.38] of Jesus.
[4353.38 → 4355.04] and it does
[4355.04 → 4355.44] all that
[4355.44 → 4356.24] by means
[4356.24 → 4357.26] of giving you
[4357.26 → 4358.48] Jesus.
[4362.12 → 4363.38] And so this week
[4363.38 → 4365.02] and in the weeks
[4365.02 → 4365.40] to come
[4365.40 → 4366.46] as you
[4366.46 → 4367.36] go
[4367.36 → 4369.08] I want to
[4369.08 → 4370.82] land
[4370.82 → 4371.80] this plane
[4371.80 → 4372.20] really
[4372.20 → 4373.00] with
[4373.00 → 4374.24] three
[4374.24 → 4376.46] summary points
[4376.46 → 4377.52] of application
[4377.52 → 4378.18] three
[4378.18 → 4379.36] ways
[4379.36 → 4380.24] to focus
[4380.24 → 4381.12] your life
[4381.12 → 4381.88] on mission
[4381.88 → 4382.60] with
[4382.60 → 4383.54] Jesus.
[4384.54 → 4385.10] And so on
[4385.10 → 4386.48] make
[4386.48 → 4387.38] Jesus'
[4388.06 → 4388.44] word
[4388.44 → 4389.54] primary.
[4391.06 → 4392.34] This is the place
[4392.34 → 4393.06] where you will
[4393.06 → 4394.12] find Jesus
[4394.12 → 4394.64] and so
[4394.64 → 4395.76] come to his
[4395.76 → 4396.40] word
[4396.40 → 4397.26] dig deep
[4397.26 → 4398.34] in his word
[4398.34 → 4399.20] if you are ever
[4399.20 → 4400.18] wondering what it is
[4400.18 → 4400.86] that you might say
[4400.86 → 4401.46] to your neighbour
[4401.46 → 4402.32] or to your kids
[4402.32 → 4403.16] to your co-worker
[4403.16 → 4404.20] or to the stranger
[4404.20 → 4404.78] that you meet
[4404.78 → 4405.86] about how you can
[4405.86 → 4406.54] show them the love
[4406.54 → 4406.88] of Jesus
[4406.88 → 4407.96] give them the words
[4407.96 → 4408.60] of Jesus
[4408.60 → 4410.48] give them the word
[4410.48 → 4410.94] of God.
[4412.30 → 4412.56] And then
[4412.56 → 4413.12] two
[4413.12 → 4414.48] connect the power
[4414.48 → 4415.00] of Jesus'
[4415.26 → 4415.62] love
[4415.62 → 4416.56] and his word
[4416.56 → 4418.30] to all of your life
[4418.30 → 4419.18] to prove
[4419.18 → 4419.94] that that word
[4419.94 → 4420.48] is true
[4420.48 → 4421.08] for you
[4421.08 → 4422.26] to prove
[4422.26 → 4423.62] that that message
[4423.62 → 4424.84] is true
[4424.84 → 4425.64] right
[4425.64 → 4426.60] authenticate
[4426.60 → 4427.98] your message
[4427.98 → 4429.26] and your gospel
[4429.26 → 4429.88] presentation
[4429.88 → 4430.84] by how you
[4430.84 → 4431.30] live
[4431.30 → 4431.98] your
[4431.98 → 4433.02] life.
[4434.52 → 4435.32] And then
[4435.32 → 4435.62] three
[4435.62 → 4437.66] never stop
[4437.66 → 4438.48] rejoicing
[4438.48 → 4439.46] in Jesus'
[4439.70 → 4440.08] victory
[4440.08 → 4441.36] over sin
[4441.36 → 4444.40] and always
[4444.40 → 4445.34] always
[4445.34 → 4446.70] keep on
[4446.70 → 4447.30] hoping
[4447.30 → 4448.40] in his
[4448.40 → 4448.94] victory
[4448.94 → 4449.72] over
[4449.72 → 4450.62] suffering.
[4452.84 → 4453.78] Some of you
[4453.78 → 4454.44] know the story
[4454.44 → 4455.60] of Joni
[4455.60 → 4456.38] Erickson Tata
[4456.38 → 4458.64] when she was
[4458.64 → 4459.98] 18 years old
[4459.98 → 4460.52] she suffered
[4460.52 → 4461.16] an accident
[4461.16 → 4462.38] by diving
[4462.38 → 4463.00] into
[4463.00 → 4463.90] too shallow
[4463.90 → 4464.64] of water
[4464.64 → 4465.62] and she became
[4465.62 → 4466.02] paralyzed
[4466.02 → 4466.54] from the
[4466.54 → 4466.94] neck down
[4466.94 → 4467.34] and has
[4467.34 → 4467.88] lived life
[4467.88 → 4468.54] since then
[4468.54 → 4469.32] as a
[4469.32 → 4470.08] quadriplegic.
[4471.00 → 4471.82] She tells
[4471.82 → 4473.48] this story
[4473.48 → 4474.22] of hoping
[4474.22 → 4475.00] in Jesus'
[4475.22 → 4475.58] victory
[4475.58 → 4476.42] over suffering
[4476.42 → 4476.72] and I'm
[4476.72 → 4477.06] going to
[4477.06 → 4477.52] end
[4477.52 → 4478.44] with her
[4478.44 → 4478.76] story.
[4480.12 → 4480.68] Joni says
[4480.68 → 4481.94] I hope
[4481.94 → 4482.58] in some
[4482.58 → 4482.86] way
[4482.86 → 4483.32] I can
[4483.32 → 4483.66] take
[4483.66 → 4483.90] my
[4483.90 → 4484.28] wheelchair
[4484.28 → 4484.70] to heaven
[4484.70 → 4486.12] and with
[4486.12 → 4486.58] my new
[4486.58 → 4487.30] glorified
[4487.30 → 4487.64] body
[4487.64 → 4488.08] I will
[4488.08 → 4488.66] stand up
[4488.66 → 4488.90] on
[4488.90 → 4489.42] resurrected
[4489.42 → 4489.90] legs
[4489.90 → 4490.50] and I
[4490.50 → 4490.82] will be
[4490.82 → 4491.30] next to
[4491.30 → 4491.64] the Lord
[4491.64 → 4491.96] Jesus
[4491.96 → 4492.60] and I
[4492.60 → 4493.18] will feel
[4493.18 → 4493.84] those nail
[4493.84 → 4494.18] prints
[4494.18 → 4494.58] in his
[4494.58 → 4494.92] hands
[4494.92 → 4495.54] and I
[4495.54 → 4496.06] will say
[4496.06 → 4496.80] thank you
[4496.80 → 4497.52] Jesus
[4497.52 → 4498.74] and he
[4498.74 → 4499.22] will know
[4499.22 → 4499.60] that I
[4499.60 → 4500.22] mean it
[4500.22 → 4500.90] because he
[4500.90 → 4501.64] will recognize
[4501.64 → 4503.80] me from
[4503.80 → 4504.24] the inner
[4504.24 → 4504.82] sanctum
[4504.82 → 4505.50] of sharing
[4505.50 → 4506.10] in the
[4506.10 → 4506.48] fellowship
[4506.48 → 4507.04] of his
[4507.04 → 4507.62] sufferings.
[4508.00 → 4508.30] He will
[4508.30 → 4508.82] see that
[4508.82 → 4509.48] I was
[4509.48 → 4509.94] one who
[4509.94 → 4510.52] identified
[4510.52 → 4511.54] with him
[4511.54 → 4512.00] in the
[4512.00 → 4512.34] sharing
[4512.34 → 4512.82] of his
[4512.82 → 4513.30] sufferings
[4513.30 → 4513.94] so my
[4513.94 → 4514.42] gratitude
[4514.42 → 4515.06] will not
[4515.06 → 4515.70] be hollow
[4515.70 → 4517.54] and then
[4517.54 → 4517.96] I will
[4517.96 → 4518.34] say
[4518.34 → 4519.26] Lord Jesus
[4519.26 → 4519.80] do you
[4519.80 → 4520.32] see that
[4520.32 → 4520.72] wheelchair
[4520.72 → 4521.40] over there?
[4522.74 → 4523.30] Well
[4523.30 → 4524.32] you were
[4524.32 → 4524.64] right
[4524.64 → 4526.12] when you
[4526.12 → 4526.66] put me
[4526.66 → 4527.06] in it
[4527.06 → 4527.82] it was
[4527.82 → 4528.08] a lot
[4528.08 → 4528.48] of trouble
[4528.48 → 4530.22] but the
[4530.22 → 4530.74] weaker I
[4530.74 → 4531.32] was in
[4531.32 → 4532.00] that thing
[4532.00 → 4532.56] the harder
[4532.56 → 4533.08] I leaned
[4533.08 → 4533.52] on you
[4533.52 → 4534.54] and the
[4534.54 → 4535.08] harder I
[4535.08 → 4535.56] leaned on
[4535.56 → 4536.00] you the
[4536.00 → 4536.68] stronger I
[4536.68 → 4537.12] discovered
[4537.12 → 4537.96] you to
[4537.96 → 4538.24] be.
[4538.24 → 4539.74] I do
[4539.74 → 4539.98] not
[4539.98 → 4540.40] think I
[4540.40 → 4540.52] would
[4540.52 → 4540.72] ever
[4540.72 → 4540.92] have
[4540.92 → 4541.16] known
[4541.16 → 4541.36] the
[4541.36 → 4541.76] glory
[4541.76 → 4542.22] of your
[4542.22 → 4542.64] grace
[4542.64 → 4543.20] where it
[4543.20 → 4543.62] not for
[4543.62 → 4543.82] the
[4543.82 → 4544.18] weakness
[4544.18 → 4544.90] of that
[4544.90 → 4545.34] wheelchair.
[4546.18 → 4546.80] So thank
[4546.80 → 4547.32] you Lord
[4547.32 → 4547.98] Jesus for
[4547.98 → 4548.30] that.
[4549.44 → 4549.98] And now
[4549.98 → 4550.68] if you
[4550.68 → 4551.48] like you
[4551.48 → 4552.02] can send
[4552.02 → 4552.52] that thing
[4552.52 → 4552.92] off to
[4552.92 → 4553.16] hell.
[4556.44 → 4557.06] Jesus'
[4557.28 → 4557.68] victory
[4557.68 → 4559.60] over sin
[4559.60 → 4560.76] is final
[4560.76 → 4562.00] and real.
[4563.42 → 4564.22] His victory
[4564.22 → 4565.04] over suffering
[4565.04 → 4565.68] is coming
[4565.68 → 4568.34] but it's
[4568.34 → 4568.72] already
[4568.72 → 4569.24] real.
[4570.54 → 4570.84] Amen?
[4572.02 → 4572.80] Amen.
[4573.00 → 4573.34] Let's pray
[4573.34 → 4573.58] today.
[4579.74 → 4580.94] Lord Jesus
[4580.94 → 4584.04] go way
[4584.04 → 4584.84] down deep
[4584.84 → 4585.80] into our
[4585.80 → 4586.34] hearts
[4586.34 → 4587.48] and lives.
[4588.84 → 4589.78] As we
[4589.78 → 4590.40] enter into
[4590.40 → 4591.26] this collision
[4591.26 → 4592.12] of need
[4592.12 → 4593.94] we pray
[4593.94 → 4594.18] that you
[4594.18 → 4594.74] would reveal
[4594.74 → 4595.50] for us
[4595.50 → 4596.24] the truth
[4596.24 → 4597.22] of our
[4597.22 → 4598.14] need to
[4598.14 → 4599.12] be reconciled
[4599.12 → 4599.56] to you.
[4599.76 → 4600.06] Reveal
[4600.06 → 4600.70] for us
[4600.70 → 4601.20] your
[4601.20 → 4601.80] utter
[4601.80 → 4602.78] and absolute
[4602.78 → 4603.46] victory
[4603.46 → 4604.24] over sin
[4604.24 → 4604.80] and death
[4604.80 → 4605.46] and grant
[4605.46 → 4606.18] us the
[4606.18 → 4607.04] hope of
[4607.04 → 4607.68] your victory
[4607.68 → 4608.70] over suffering.
[4610.80 → 4611.18] May we
[4611.18 → 4612.04] go from
[4612.04 → 4612.78] this place
[4612.78 → 4613.58] nourished by
[4613.58 → 4614.20] your word
[4614.20 → 4615.30] and at
[4615.30 → 4615.82] your table
[4615.82 → 4617.04] as a
[4617.04 → 4617.38] people
[4617.38 → 4618.32] transformed
[4618.32 → 4619.56] to live
[4619.56 → 4620.54] for you.
[4621.26 → 4621.86] Transformed
[4621.86 → 4622.46] to live
[4622.46 → 4623.06] for the
[4623.06 → 4623.44] glory
[4623.44 → 4624.14] of your
[4624.14 → 4624.96] name.
[4625.16 → 4625.74] Transformed
[4625.74 → 4626.42] with our
[4626.42 → 4626.76] hearts
[4626.76 → 4627.66] affections
[4627.66 → 4628.26] stirred
[4628.26 → 4628.74] that we
[4628.74 → 4629.02] might
[4629.02 → 4629.60] proclaim
[4629.60 → 4630.52] you
[4630.52 → 4630.94] Lord
[4630.94 → 4631.36] Jesus
[4631.36 → 4632.68] for the
[4632.68 → 4632.96] world.
[4634.20 → 4634.44] In
[4634.44 → 4634.86] Christ
[4634.86 → 4635.34] Jesus
[4635.34 → 4635.96] we pray
[4635.96 → 4637.38] Amen.
[4638.30 → 4638.94] Amen.
[4644.10 → 4644.96] As we
[4644.96 → 4645.22] prayed
[4645.22 → 4645.82] we are
[4645.82 → 4646.60] coming
[4646.60 → 4647.90] to the
[4647.90 → 4648.32] table.
[4649.24 → 4649.68] Now this
[4649.68 → 4650.70] table
[4650.70 → 4651.94] is for
[4651.94 → 4652.50] us
[4652.50 → 4653.32] what we
[4653.32 → 4653.70] call a
[4653.70 → 4654.30] means of
[4654.30 → 4654.72] grace
[4654.72 → 4655.50] and what
[4655.50 → 4656.06] that means
[4656.06 → 4656.68] is that
[4656.68 → 4657.48] the Jesus
[4657.48 → 4657.80] that we
[4657.80 → 4658.24] heard about
[4658.24 → 4658.50] in the
[4658.50 → 4658.76] word
[4658.76 → 4660.36] is now
[4660.36 → 4660.58] here
[4660.58 → 4660.94] offered
[4660.94 → 4661.88] at the
[4661.88 → 4662.20] table.
[4662.98 → 4663.38] The grace
[4663.38 → 4663.70] that we
[4663.70 → 4664.08] have heard
[4664.08 → 4664.36] in the
[4664.36 → 4664.74] gospel
[4664.74 → 4665.62] is now
[4665.62 → 4665.92] here
[4665.92 → 4666.46] made
[4666.46 → 4667.46] tangible
[4667.46 → 4668.12] that you
[4668.12 → 4668.74] can taste
[4668.74 → 4669.96] and see
[4669.96 → 4671.00] the grace
[4671.00 → 4671.74] of our
[4671.74 → 4672.40] good
[4672.40 → 4673.04] God.
[4673.16 → 4673.42] And so
[4673.42 → 4673.84] the Lord
[4673.84 → 4674.42] invites
[4674.42 → 4675.08] all those
[4675.08 → 4676.16] who believe
[4676.16 → 4676.72] in him
[4676.72 → 4677.54] to come
[4677.54 → 4677.96] to this
[4677.96 → 4678.32] table
[4678.32 → 4678.62] with
[4678.62 → 4679.24] gladness.
[4679.34 → 4679.68] The Lord
[4679.68 → 4680.14] invites
[4680.14 → 4680.90] all of
[4680.90 → 4681.24] us who
[4681.24 → 4681.44] have
[4681.44 → 4682.20] proclaimed
[4682.20 → 4682.52] that
[4682.52 → 4682.88] truth
[4682.88 → 4683.54] in life
[4683.54 → 4684.08] and in
[4684.08 → 4684.30] deed
[4684.30 → 4684.72] together
[4684.72 → 4685.64] who rely
[4685.64 → 4686.64] on Jesus
[4686.64 → 4687.24] for our
[4687.24 → 4687.62] salvation
[4687.62 → 4688.18] to come
[4688.18 → 4688.76] to this
[4688.76 → 4689.10] table
[4689.10 → 4689.70] to be
[4689.70 → 4690.04] met
[4690.04 → 4690.96] by
[4690.96 → 4692.00] him.
[4693.76 → 4694.44] At
[4694.44 → 4694.62] his
[4694.62 → 4695.06] last
[4695.06 → 4695.66] supper
[4695.66 → 4696.90] our
[4696.90 → 4697.14] Lord
[4697.14 → 4697.48] Jesus
[4697.48 → 4699.24] took
[4699.24 → 4699.56] bread
[4699.56 → 4700.96] and when
[4700.96 → 4701.32] he had
[4701.32 → 4701.56] given
[4701.56 → 4702.20] thanks
[4702.20 → 4704.42] he broke
[4704.42 → 4704.66] it
[4704.66 → 4705.74] and said
[4705.74 → 4706.40] this
[4706.40 → 4706.92] is
[4706.92 → 4707.28] my
[4707.28 → 4707.70] body
[4707.70 → 4708.80] which
[4708.80 → 4709.02] is

[4709.20 → 4709.48] you
[4709.48 → 4710.76] do
[4710.76 → 4711.22] this

[4712.08 → 4712.50] remembrance
[4712.50 → 4713.52] of
[4713.52 → 4713.76] me
[4713.76 → 4715.74] and in
[4715.74 → 4716.16] the same
[4716.16 → 4716.68] way
[4716.68 → 4717.12] he
[4717.12 → 4717.76] took
[4717.76 → 4717.94] the
[4717.94 → 4718.26] cup
[4718.26 → 4719.12] after
[4719.12 → 4719.58] supper
[4719.58 → 4722.12] he
[4722.12 → 4722.28] said
[4722.28 → 4722.52] this
[4722.52 → 4722.88] cup
[4722.88 → 4723.36] is
[4723.36 → 4723.52] the
[4723.52 → 4723.72] new
[4723.72 → 4724.06] covenant
[4724.06 → 4724.84] in
[4724.84 → 4725.04] my
[4725.04 → 4725.44] blood
[4725.44 → 4726.98] do
[4726.98 → 4727.46] this

[4728.30 → 4728.74] remembrance
[4728.74 → 4729.58] of
[4729.58 → 4729.88] me
[4729.88 → 4730.92] for
[4730.92 → 4731.24] whenever
[4731.24 → 4731.52] we
[4731.52 → 4731.80] eat
[4731.80 → 4732.14] this
[4732.14 → 4732.48] bread
[4732.48 → 4732.82] and
[4732.82 → 4733.28] drink
[4733.28 → 4733.72] this

[4734.14 → 4734.78] we
[4734.78 → 4735.30] proclaim
[4735.30 → 4735.76] the
[4735.76 → 4736.24] Lord's
[4736.24 → 4736.76] death
[4736.76 → 4737.20] and
[4737.20 → 4737.68] resurrection
[4737.68 → 4738.50] until
