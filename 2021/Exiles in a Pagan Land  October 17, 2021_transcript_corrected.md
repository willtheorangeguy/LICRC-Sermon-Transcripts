[424.00 → 426.00] That is enough.
[426.00 → 428.00] That is enough.
[428.00 → 430.00] Because You are enough.
[430.00 → 432.00] You are enough.
[432.00 → 434.00] You're my portion.
[434.00 → 463.98] You are enough.
[464.00 → 469.00] You are enough.
[471.00 → 474.00] I will be content.

[477.00 → 483.00] You are enough.
[483.00 → 493.00] You are enough.

[520.00 → 521.00] You are enough.
[521.00 → 523.00] You are enough.
[523.00 → 527.00] How much more does he love you?
[527.00 → 532.00] If he dresses you with beauty and splendour
[532.00 → 539.00] How much more will he love you?
[539.00 → 546.00] If he watches over every spiral
[546.00 → 551.00] How much more does he love you?
[551.00 → 554.00] How much more does he love you?
[554.00 → 560.00] If he dresses you with beauty and splendour
[560.00 → 565.00] How much more will he love you?
[565.00 → 568.00] How much more will he love you?
[568.00 → 575.00] If he watches over every spiral
[575.00 → 579.00] How much more does he love you?
[581.00 → 590.00] Good
[590.00 → 593.00] Everyone awake?
[593.00 → 595.00] Alright
[595.00 → 598.00] Welcome to church
[598.00 → 600.00] Good morning, how are we doing?
[600.00 → 607.00] Alright, half of us are good, the other half are still asleep. Excellent.
[607.00 → 619.00] My name is Chris, and it's my privilege to lead you here in our worship together, along with these others on stage and those who are lazily making their way to the stage.
[619.00 → 631.00] We are really excited this morning in our worship. We have the chance to participate in and witness three baptisms of some of our littlest covenant family members.
[631.00 → 634.00] And so later in our service, you will see that.
[634.00 → 642.00] And so, whether you are here in person or participating online, please know that that covenant family extends out to you.
[642.00 → 650.00] And when we respond later in the service in promise of support, you at home, I encourage you to do that with us as well.
[650.00 → 656.00] Before we begin, there are a couple announcements that we want to make.
[656.00 → 659.00] First, I want to draw your attention.
[659.00 → 667.00] If you are part of our covenant family here, you probably receive an e-bulletin each week and maybe a midweek memo as well.
[667.00 → 672.00] In the e-bulletin and midweek memo is a survey from the library team.
[672.00 → 682.00] And so, we are trying to gauge use of the church library here and how we can do that better or more effectively or more appropriately to your needs.
[682.00 → 692.00] And so, please take time to find that in the e-bulletin and follow through with that survey so that we can best serve you in that capacity.
[692.00 → 702.00] Also, just a note for prayer this week on Tuesday, CLASSES, which is the regional gathering of CRC churches that we are part of, is happening.
[702.00 → 710.00] It will be a Zoom meeting on Tuesday, but we encourage you to pray for the church leaders and those who gather on that day.
[710.00 → 728.00] As well, the Safe Church team, specifically the first aid and health aspect of it, is looking for a few point people to be sort of on call or on duty during our worship service.
[728.00 → 740.00] And so, we want to have someone who will be our sort of point person for issues of first aid or emergency healthcare or whatever, who knows that they are responsible should an issue happen.
[740.00 → 748.00] To be that kind of person, we are asking that you would have either first aid training or that you have experience in healthcare.
[748.00 → 759.00] If that's something that you might be interested in, if we can populate a list of five or six or ten people so that you can have an assigned week or month, that would be really great.
[759.00 → 764.00] And so, if that's something you are interested in, you can talk to Heather. Heather, you're here this morning. Wave.
[764.00 → 769.00] Hi, Heather, so everyone can see. That's Heather. She's embarrassed that I called her out like that.
[769.00 → 776.00] You can grab her, or you can grab me if you don't know who Heather is, and I will introduce you to Heather following our time together.
[776.00 → 781.00] Also, we're really grateful this past week that the cadets ministry started.
[781.00 → 786.00] There were 17 boys out and are expecting a few more to come out for that, and that was a perfect time.
[786.00 → 790.00] We're excited for that. And the GEMS ministry is getting started.
[790.00 → 794.00] Now, there was a bit of a misprint in the announcements in the e-bulletin.
[794.00 → 800.00] And so, the first GEMS meeting is not this week. This week will be a GEMS leaders meeting.
[800.00 → 806.00] So, clarification, GEMS leaders meeting, GEMS counsellors meeting happening this week, Thursday.
[806.00 → 810.00] And then, in two weeks' time, GEMS for the girls will begin.
[810.00 → 813.00] We are still looking for a couple counsellors for GEMS.
[813.00 → 816.00] And so, if you can, please talk to Courtney. Courtney is at the back. She can wave.
[816.00 → 821.00] Yep, very good. You can talk to her and get service there.
[821.00 → 828.00] And then, lastly, but definitely not least, tonight begins Catechism for the Youth.
[828.00 → 837.00] And so, if you are in our youth program, grades 9 to 12, you have a chance to come here and to study and to learn about our Christian faith.
[837.00 → 843.00] And if you have any questions about that, Pastor Kevin is here. He can address those.
[843.00 → 846.00] I think I got them all checked. All right.
[846.00 → 848.00] We're going to worship our God together this morning.
[848.00 → 857.00] And to do that, I'm going to invite you to stand, if you are able, that we might be gathered in his presence as he welcomes us here.
[857.00 → 862.00] And so, receive the greeting of our God.
[862.00 → 874.00] Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Saviour, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[874.00 → 877.00] All God's people said, Amen.
[877.00 → 879.00] Let's worship our God this morning.
[879.00 → 908.00] Let the King of my heart be the mountain where I run, the fountain I drink from, oh, he is mine.
[908.00 → 925.00] Let the King of my heart be the shadow where I hide, the ransom for my life, oh, he is my song.
[925.00 → 954.00] You are good, good, oh, you are good, good, oh, you are good, good, oh.
[954.00 → 968.00] Let the King of my heart be the wind inside my sails, the anchor in the waves, oh, he is my song.
[968.00 → 982.00] Let the King of my heart be the King of my heart be the fire inside my veins, the echo of my days, oh, he is my song.
[982.00 → 983.00] Let the King of my heart be the lion, the sight of my heart be the yellow31.
[983.00 → 984.00] Let the King of my heart be the energy in the wilderness, oh, you are good, good, oh.
[984.00 → 997.00] Let the King of my heart be a little fan in the waves, when my sovereign fleeting says oh, you are good, good, oh, you are good, oh, you are good, good, oh.
[997.00 → 1004.00] You are good, good home
[1004.00 → 1012.00] You are good, good home
[1012.00 → 1020.00] You're never going to let, never going to let me down
[1020.00 → 1039.00] You're never going to let, never going to let me down
[1039.00 → 1049.00] You're never going to let, never going to let me down
[1049.00 → 1068.64] You're never going to let, never going to let me down.
[1068.64 → 1095.40] You are good, good, oh, you are good, good, oh, you are good, good, oh.
[1098.64 → 1126.36] When the night is holding on to me, God is holding on.
[1126.36 → 1140.36] When the night is holding on to me, God is holding on.
[1140.36 → 1141.36] Amen.
[1170.36 → 1179.76] You have been a refuge for the poor, a refuge for the needy in their distress, a shelter from the storm and a shade from the heat.
[1180.66 → 1181.90] Surely this is our God.
[1182.16 → 1184.04] We trusted him, and he saved us.
[1184.58 → 1185.46] This is the Lord.
[1185.86 → 1186.78] We trusted in him.
[1187.30 → 1189.70] Let us rejoice and be glad in his salvation.
[1189.70 → 1191.70] We trusted him, and he saved us.
[1191.70 → 1195.70] We trusted him, and he saved us.
[1195.70 → 1209.70] We trusted him, and he saved us.
[1209.70 → 1211.90] I will worship.
[1212.42 → 1214.08] I will worship.
[1214.32 → 1216.32] With all of my heart.
[1216.58 → 1218.62] With all of my heart.

[1227.70 → 1238.82] I will praise you.
[1241.98 → 1244.24] Could be all of your strength.
[1244.24 → 1246.12] Speaking of all of my strength.

[1251.00 → 1256.32] I will give you all my praise
[1256.32 → 1260.36] You alone I long to worship
[1260.36 → 1265.94] You alone I worthy of my praise

[1277.28 → 1279.28] I will serve you
[1279.28 → 1281.28] Give you everything
[1281.28 → 1283.28] Everything
[1283.28 → 1286.28] I will lift
[1286.28 → 1288.28] I will lift
[1288.28 → 1290.28] My eyes to your throne
[1290.28 → 1293.28] My eyes to your throne
[1293.28 → 1295.28] I will trust you
[1295.28 → 1297.28] I will trust you
[1297.28 → 1299.28] Trust you alone
[1299.28 → 1302.28] Just you alone
[1302.28 → 1306.28] I will give you all my worship
[1306.28 → 1311.28] I will give you all my praise
[1311.28 → 1316.28] You alone I long to worship

[1335.28 → 1341.28] You alone I worthy of my praise
[1341.28 → 1353.28] Lord, we come before you in worship
[1353.28 → 1354.28] Praising your name
[1354.28 → 1356.28] Praising you for what you have done
[1356.28 → 1358.28] You are king over our lives
[1358.28 → 1360.28] And we have been chosen by you
[1360.28 → 1362.28] But we stumble, and we disobey
[1362.28 → 1364.28] You are faithful
[1364.28 → 1366.28] But we grow weary
[1366.28 → 1367.28] You are merciful
[1367.28 → 1369.28] But we hide in our shame
[1369.28 → 1371.28] You are our sturdy rock
[1371.28 → 1373.28] But we step onto the sand
[1373.28 → 1374.28] And we sink into the waves
[1374.28 → 1376.28] Remind us of who we are
[1376.28 → 1377.28] Because of you
[1377.28 → 1379.28] Remind us when we grow weary
[1379.28 → 1380.28] In our striving
[1380.28 → 1382.28] That we can lean on your faithfulness
[1382.28 → 1384.28] Remind us that when we feel guilt
[1384.28 → 1385.28] And shame
[1385.28 → 1388.28] Your mercies are ever flowing
[1388.28 → 1389.28] Remind us when we see
[1389.28 → 1391.28] The chaotic world around us
[1391.28 → 1394.28] That in you remain the same sturdy rock
[1394.28 → 1395.28] That we can always rely on
[1395.28 → 1397.28] Because we are your chosen people
[1397.28 → 1399.28] And we are made new in you
[1399.28 → 1419.28] You unravel me with a melody
[1419.28 → 1424.28] With a melody
[1424.28 → 1429.28] You surround me with a song
[1429.28 → 1433.28] Of deliverance
[1433.28 → 1437.28] From my enemies
[1437.28 → 1443.28] Till all my fears are gone
[1443.28 → 1445.28] I'm no longer a slave to fear
[1445.28 → 1458.28] I am a child of God
[1458.28 → 1464.28] I'm no longer a slave to fear
[1464.28 → 1471.28] I am a child of God
[1471.28 → 1487.28] From my mother's womb
[1487.28 → 1488.28] You have chosen me
[1488.28 → 1489.28] You have chosen me
[1489.28 → 1490.28] Your love has called my name
[1490.28 → 1494.28] Your love has called my name
[1494.28 → 1498.28] Your love has called my name
[1498.28 → 1502.28] I've been born again
[1502.28 → 1504.28] Into your family
[1504.28 → 1508.28] Your blood flows through my veins
[1508.28 → 1513.28] Flows through my veins
[1513.28 → 1518.28] I'm no longer a slave to fear
[1518.28 → 1523.28] I am a child of God
[1523.28 → 1536.28] I'm no longer a slave to fear
[1536.28 → 1541.28] I am a child of God
[1541.28 → 1556.28] I am a child of God
[1556.28 → 1562.28] I'm no longer a slave to fear
[1562.28 → 1565.28] I am a child of God
[1565.28 → 1569.28] I am a child of God
[1569.28 → 1570.28] But I'm no longer a slave to fear
[1571.28 → 1572.28] I am a child of God
[1572.28 → 1573.28] I am a child of God
[1573.28 → 1577.94] I am an elder
[1577.94 → 1579.78] O-oh
[1579.78 → 1583.28] O-oh
[1583.28 → 1586.66] O-oh
[1586.66 → 1588.28] O-oh
[1588.28 → 1589.72] O-oh
[1589.72 → 1592.72] O-oh
[1592.76 → 1595.28] O-oh
[1595.28 → 1595.54] O-oh
[1595.54 → 1597.42] O-oh
[1597.42 → 1604.22] You split the sea so I could walk right through it.
[1604.22 → 1609.42] My fears were drowned in perfect love.
[1611.56 → 1617.72] You rescued me so I could stand and sing.
[1618.04 → 1622.94] I am a child of God.
[1622.94 → 1632.32] You split the sea so I could walk right through it.
[1632.32 → 1637.32] My fears were drowned in perfect love.
[1637.32 → 1645.42] You rescued me so I could stand and sing.
[1645.42 → 1651.80] I am a child of God.
[1651.80 → 1658.44] I am a child of God.
[1658.44 → 1660.18] What a thief!
[1660.18 → 1665.18] I am a child of God.
[1665.18 → 1674.56] I am a child of God.
[1674.56 → 1679.56] I am a child of God.
[1679.56 → 1685.94] I am a child of God.
[1685.94 → 1693.94] I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[1693.94 → 1698.94] I am a child of God.
[1698.94 → 1708.32] I am a child of God.
[1708.32 → 1709.32] You may be seated.
[1709.32 → 1735.70] I am a child of God.
[1735.70 → 1736.70] Good morning.
[1736.70 → 1747.08] Today's budget is for refugee chaplain Dina Nikolai and also for the budget.
[1747.08 → 1754.70] Dina Nikolai is the chaplain and refugee support mobilizer as well as commissioner, pastor with
[1754.70 → 1756.08] the CRC church.
[1756.08 → 1761.08] Dina offers her presence and supports refugees who are new to Canada.
[1761.08 → 1769.28] She helps refugees access service at the Immigration Service Society of BC and acts as a bridge between
[1769.28 → 1776.46] churches and newcomers as well as helping them integrate into communities here in BC.
[1776.46 → 1782.14] Unless otherwise noted, all offerings will go towards the refugee chaplain, Dina Nikolai.

[1861.74 → 1873.90] Gloria, Gloria, glory to God alone.
[1873.90 → 1888.10] In Christ alone we're justified.
[1889.48 → 1894.46] His righteousness is all our plea.
[1895.78 → 1900.90] Your lost demands are satisfied.
[1900.90 → 1907.00] His perfect work has set us free.
[1907.88 → 1917.90] Gloria, Gloria, glory to God alone.
[1917.90 → 1929.90] Gloria, Gloria, glory to God alone.

[1951.78 → 1958.22] Hearts that were once by sin enslaved.
[1958.76 → 1963.78] Now by your power have been made new.

[2021.54 → 2042.16] It is our great privilege this morning in our worship to administer the sacrament of baptism
[2042.16 → 2050.32] to three of our little children. Now, I say this all the time when we come together for baptism,
[2050.32 → 2055.96] but I want to be really clear. We do not believe that there's anything magical about the water that
[2055.96 → 2062.42] we are going to put on these kids today, but we do recognize that this is a miraculous mystery of
[2062.42 → 2069.76] God's grace. That's what we are acknowledging here. The water doesn't wash away original sin or save
[2069.76 → 2077.96] the child. Only Jesus' life, death, resurrection, and exaltation in our place does that. We believe
[2077.96 → 2084.80] that these children are sinful by nature and that the promises of God for the forgiveness of sins and
[2084.80 → 2092.12] life in the Holy Spirit applies to them. We baptize our kids not out of superstition or out of tradition
[2092.12 → 2098.78] or because we like really cute babies. We baptize infants because they are covenant children
[2098.78 → 2108.36] and therefore should receive the covenant. In Genesis 15, God made a covenant with Abraham,
[2109.08 → 2115.38] and that covenant was sealed in the sign of circumcision in Genesis 17, and God promised to
[2115.38 → 2123.78] bless Abraham. Now, for Abraham, that meant two things in particular. It meant offspring and it meant land.
[2123.78 → 2132.52] But at the heart of this covenant was God's promise that he would be a God to Abraham and his children.
[2133.74 → 2143.60] And so, God cut a covenant into Israel's flesh, carving out a people for himself. And these people
[2143.60 → 2152.44] would be a light home, a light on the path home for all of humanity. Now, in the fullness of time,
[2152.44 → 2162.02] then, God sent his Son, Jesus, to be our Saviour. And in his death on the cross, our old self is dead
[2162.02 → 2169.76] and buried. And in his resurrection, we are raised into newness of life with him, and we look forward
[2169.76 → 2177.32] to that grand and glorious new creation. When we are baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son
[2177.32 → 2184.36] and of the Holy Spirit, the triune God, seals our adoption as his children and writes his name invisibly
[2184.36 → 2193.82] on our foreheads. He says, you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging
[2193.82 → 2202.86] to God. Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God. By baptism, we have a new covenant
[2202.86 → 2211.04] identity in Jesus Christ. And so, when we gather here on this day to administer the sacrament of
[2211.04 → 2218.18] baptism to these children, we do so with the weight of church history to encourage us, with the example
[2218.18 → 2225.96] of redemptive history to confirm our practice. We baptize in obedience to Christ's command.
[2225.96 → 2232.40] The sacrament that we are about to administer is a sign of the inclusion into the covenant community,
[2232.76 → 2238.06] just as circumcision was. And the water that we are about to sprinkle is a sign of the cleansing from
[2238.06 → 2245.98] sin, as the sprinkled blood of bulls and goats in the Old Testament was. Today, we pray that Dawson
[2245.98 → 2251.82] and April and Reuben will take advantage of all their covenant privileges, that they will acknowledge
[2251.82 → 2258.36] the Lord all the days of their life, and by faith, they will make these promises their own.
[2259.56 → 2265.28] And so, Dave and Sheila, Justin and Tanya, Matt and Annalise, I want to invite you to come up to the front
[2265.28 → 2271.62] and just sort of spread yourselves out with your crews across the stage here, or across the bottom.
[2271.62 → 2298.92] Okay, so, standing here, since you have presented your children for baptism, we're going to ask you a series of questions,
[2298.92 → 2301.92] and then invite you to come up to the pond, and we'll...
[2301.92 → 2303.46] together.
[2303.46 → 2323.14] Okay.
[2323.14 → 2323.16] Okay.
[2323.50 → 2323.68] Whoa.
[2326.08 → 2326.52] Yeah?
[2327.32 → 2328.72] Oh, I don't know what's going on.
[2331.12 → 2332.76] Don't do too much. Don't move.
[2333.46 → 2335.96] Don't say a word.
[2336.32 → 2337.44] All right, we're going to be here for a while.
[2339.68 → 2340.04] Okay.
[2340.74 → 2343.16] If you didn't catch anything I said before, talk to me after.
[2343.68 → 2344.32] I'll repeat it.
[2345.84 → 2351.54] All right, I'm going to ask you guys a series of questions, and then we'll come along and then ask you to respond
[2351.54 → 2354.44] individually as families together.
[2356.48 → 2359.64] Dave and Sheila, Justin and Tanya, Matt and Annalise.
[2359.64 → 2366.76] Since you have presented these children for baptism, we ask you these questions.
[2366.76 → 2378.12] Do you believe that your children, though sinful by nature, are received by God in Christ as members of his covenant and therefore ought to be baptized?
[2378.12 → 2399.12] And do you promise, in reliance on the Holy Spirit, with the help of this Christian community, to do all you can in your power to instruct these little ones and all your children in the Christian faith and lead them by your example into the life of Christian discipleship?
[2399.12 → 2402.60] Dave and Sheila, what is your answer?
[2403.56 → 2403.90] We do.
[2404.12 → 2404.60] God help you.
[2405.92 → 2407.64] Matt and Annalise, what is your answer?
[2408.24 → 2408.60] We do.
[2408.80 → 2409.34] God help you.
[2410.84 → 2412.64] Justin and Tanya, what is your answer?
[2413.30 → 2413.76] We do.
[2413.98 → 2414.46] God help you.
[2414.46 → 2417.56] I'm not sure that one was working either, but anyway.
[2418.18 → 2419.04] They all said we do.
[2419.70 → 2420.86] They all asked for God's help.
[2423.78 → 2424.34] All right.
[2425.54 → 2434.04] This point, parents, if you are comfortable with this, I'm going to invite you to send your little kids up to the front, and we're going to gather over here.
[2434.12 → 2436.68] So if you guys just move a little bit here so we have some room.
[2437.08 → 2449.22] Kids, if you come here and just sort of sit down in this space, you can come up and see what's happening here as we remember that our Lord Jesus invited all the little children to come to him.
[2449.22 → 2454.54] And he said, do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
[2454.64 → 2457.02] And so you guys are going to want to be able to see over here, okay?
[2457.02 → 2462.12] All right.
[2462.24 → 2471.24] In just a moment, we're going to invite each one of these up to receive the sacrament of baptism.
[2472.18 → 2475.12] Now, some of you guys were baptized in this church, right?
[2476.24 → 2476.70] Some of you.
[2476.70 → 2477.80] I know, Nora, you weren't.
[2478.50 → 2478.98] That's right.
[2479.02 → 2479.84] But some of you were.
[2479.94 → 2482.50] So some of you have seen this here before.
[2483.06 → 2485.28] Do you know what this water means?
[2485.28 → 2487.80] Go ahead, Zoe.
[2491.46 → 2493.76] Jesus writes his name on your head.
[2493.86 → 2494.22] Amen.
[2495.18 → 2496.34] What a great answer.
[2497.48 → 2497.92] Anyone else?
[2497.98 → 2498.20] Haley?
[2506.68 → 2507.94] Jesus had his feet washed.
[2508.02 → 2508.46] That's right.
[2508.98 → 2509.36] That's right.
[2509.40 → 2514.64] So the water also symbolizes the washing of our sins, right?
[2514.64 → 2517.50] And so when we have these babies come up, right?
[2517.72 → 2523.04] Jesus is showing us that he washes our sins, and he writes his name on our foreheads.
[2523.52 → 2530.64] And so as they come up and you guys see that, I want you to think that many of you, maybe even all of you, had the same thing happen to you, right?
[2530.70 → 2536.38] That this is a chance to remember that Jesus has written his name on your foreheads as well.
[2536.38 → 2538.44] Why don't we come in order?
[2538.70 → 2540.28] Dave and Sheila, why don't you come up here first?
[2552.66 → 2563.24] Dawson, Arthur, Skipper, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[2563.24 → 2564.56] Amen.
[2576.12 → 2579.78] Matt and Annalise, why don't you find a way around?
[2579.78 → 2597.30] Ruben, Theodore, Birken pass.
[2597.96 → 2604.70] I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[2605.48 → 2605.78] Amen.
[2605.78 → 2605.96] Amen.
[2605.96 → 2606.00] Amen.
[2609.78 → 2619.24] And then Justin and Tanya.
[2629.24 → 2630.58] Do you want Emma to come up here?
[2632.42 → 2633.64] Emma, do you want to come up to you?
[2634.72 → 2635.06] Yeah.
[2635.06 → 2635.16] Yeah.
[2635.60 → 2635.66] Yeah.
[2635.66 → 2635.72] Yeah.
[2639.78 → 2647.94] April, Tegan, Riley, Smith.
[2648.34 → 2655.66] I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[2657.16 → 2657.46] Amen.
[2657.46 → 2657.62] Amen.
[2657.62 → 2668.90] All right, you guys can join them down there.
[2677.08 → 2683.44] This must be something about the kinds of parents this church has, but I've done a number of baptisms here, and none of the kids have cried during it.
[2683.44 → 2688.68] So, for the rest of you who are thinking about baptisms, there's a bar.
[2690.84 → 2696.50] Although, if we do a believer's baptism, and you don't cry, like an adult baptism, hmm.
[2699.00 → 2703.82] Together, we have a chance to promise these families our support.
[2703.82 → 2716.92] And so, I'm going to invite you now, as a covenant family, to stand, and I will ask you a question and invite you to respond with, we do, God helping us, we do, with God's help.
[2717.76 → 2726.30] Also, again, if you are at home, I invite you to respond out loud to this question as well.
[2726.30 → 2735.14] And so, brothers and sisters of our Lord Jesus Christ, church, family, here, gathered and digitally present,
[2735.56 → 2742.36] do you promise to love and encourage and support Dawson and April and Ruben and their families
[2742.36 → 2749.90] by teaching the gospel of God's love, by being an example of Christian faith and character,
[2750.40 → 2756.94] and by giving the strong support of God's family in fellowship, prayer, and service?
[2757.30 → 2758.04] What is your answer?
[2761.10 → 2761.42] Amen.
[2762.10 → 2762.44] Amen.
[2762.60 → 2763.18] You may be seated.
[2767.02 → 2771.48] And now, together, receive the blessing of God.
[2772.36 → 2775.00] Dawson and April and Ruben.
[2775.76 → 2778.26] The Lord bless you and keep you.
[2778.94 → 2783.08] The Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[2783.84 → 2789.82] The Lord turn his face towards you and give you his peace all your lives.
[2790.74 → 2796.42] In this way, the Lord puts his name on our children and makes them his own.
[2797.42 → 2799.58] Together, we say, amen.
[2799.58 → 2799.78] Amen.
[2800.90 → 2801.62] All right, kids.
[2801.68 → 2806.26] As you make your way back to your parents, I'm going to invite Elder Eric to come up to the front.
[2806.64 → 2809.94] He has a gift on behalf of the church for you guys.
[2810.58 → 2814.06] Just want to note that as you open the gifts, the individual names will be there.
[2814.16 → 2817.04] There is a baptismal certificate that will be coming.
[2817.90 → 2820.42] Our church administrator has been on vacation for a couple of weeks,
[2820.42 → 2822.48] and so we don't have them printed and ready to give to you.
[2822.48 → 2823.48] Thank you.
[2823.48 → 2823.54] Thank you.
[2823.54 → 2823.60] Thank you.
[2823.60 → 2823.66] Thank you.

[3014.92 → 3019.78] Make his face shine upon you
[3019.78 → 3022.94] And be gracious to you
[3022.94 → 3029.94] The Lord turn his face toward you

[3115.94 → 3117.94] And their children
[3117.94 → 3120.94] May his presence go before you
[3120.94 → 3122.94] And behind you
[3122.94 → 3124.94] And beside you
[3124.94 → 3126.94] All around you

[3131.94 → 3133.94] In the morning
[3133.94 → 3135.94] In the evening

[3137.94 → 3139.94] And you're going
[3139.94 → 3141.94] And you're weeping
[3141.94 → 3143.94] And rejoicing

[3144.66 → 3146.94] He is with you
[3146.94 → 3147.94] He is with you
[3147.94 → 3148.94] He is with you

[3165.44 → 3175.16] Amen, Amen, Amen.
[3175.16 → 3190.44] Amen, Amen, Amen.
[3190.44 → 3206.10] Amen, Amen, Amen.
[3206.10 → 3217.90] Amen, Amen.
[3217.90 → 3232.84] Amen, Amen.
[3232.84 → 3233.00] Amen.
[3234.00 → 3238.50] Okay, can we have all the kids back up front to do the children's blessings so that I believe
[3238.50 → 3241.08] is ages three up to grade four.
[3247.90 → 3253.78] Oh, there's a good crowd this week.
[3253.84 → 3254.78] Nice to see you guys.
[3254.90 → 3257.18] It's been a while, I think, since I've seen some of you.
[3257.18 → 3262.68] I've made it onto the internet a time or two, Zoe.
[3262.80 → 3264.72] Thanks for being a fan.
[3266.58 → 3271.04] So guys, have you guys, that was pretty cool, hey, seeing all those baptisms?
[3271.04 → 3276.14] It was pretty cool, hey, seeing the baptisms today.
[3276.70 → 3279.20] What's one of the big things that comes from a baptism?
[3279.40 → 3281.72] What's a big thing we're reminded of with a baptism?
[3283.62 → 3284.68] Yeah, the water.
[3284.82 → 3287.34] It signifies a huge promise, right?
[3287.46 → 3290.60] God is so much bigger than us and has big promises for us.
[3290.90 → 3293.30] And we've been learning about that in children's worship time, right?
[3293.76 → 3297.32] Can you guys remember what we've been, let's remind our moms and dads, what have we been
[3297.32 → 3300.02] learning about in children's worship time lately?
[3300.40 → 3301.72] And Zoe, we've got all the answers.
[3303.70 → 3305.34] Yes, last week was Noah's Ark.
[3305.44 → 3306.94] We're in the Book of Genesis right now.
[3307.00 → 3310.06] So last week was Noah's Ark, and before that we talked about the fall.
[3310.44 → 3312.32] And what was another story we talked about recently?
[3317.86 → 3318.70] Is it creation?
[3319.28 → 3320.34] Yeah, creation.
[3320.34 → 3321.36] We talked about creation.
[3321.78 → 3325.96] So this week we've got another story about God's big promises,
[3325.96 → 3329.04] and that is the Tower of Babel.
[3329.58 → 3330.64] That's a crazy story.
[3331.08 → 3332.96] So why don't we do the children's blessing,
[3333.48 → 3338.10] and then we will go gather in the big room and learn about the Tower of Babel.
[3338.30 → 3339.34] So let's all stand together.
[3341.64 → 3343.82] And if the congregation can stand with us.
[3346.30 → 3347.02] Ready, guys?
[3347.10 → 3347.62] Hands up.
[3347.62 → 3356.84] All right, let's go to children's worship time.
[3367.84 → 3368.50] Is this still on?
[3368.70 → 3369.14] Okay, yep.
[3371.80 → 3372.16] Hello?
[3372.82 → 3373.06] Yeah.
[3373.58 → 3375.06] Man, I don't like my voice on this thing.
[3375.06 → 3376.02] Okay.
[3376.98 → 3377.64] Hey, everyone.
[3378.94 → 3382.60] So last week it was announced that we're doing the care packages again
[3382.60 → 3384.96] for the young adults that are studying abroad.
[3385.74 → 3387.40] We still need a few more volunteers.
[3388.82 → 3390.14] Just a quick recap.
[3390.14 → 3396.24] We're getting either individuals, families, or groups of friends to volunteer
[3396.24 → 3400.58] to buy stuff to send to young adults who are studying abroad,
[3400.58 → 3402.84] so they still feel connected to this congregation.
[3403.96 → 3408.58] If you want to volunteer and do that, please come contact me after church.
[3409.04 → 3410.42] I'll connect you with a young adult,
[3410.58 → 3413.30] which can help you personalize the stuff for them.
[3415.36 → 3415.80] Thanks.
[3416.38 → 3417.08] We've already got a volunteer.
[3418.92 → 3420.50] Yeah, so please come contact me.
[3420.58 → 3421.28] It would be great.
[3421.50 → 3424.94] They loved it last year, and we're hoping to do this every semester.
[3424.94 → 3429.64] You guys are great people, and you guys volunteer for a lot of things,
[3429.94 → 3430.92] so thank you already.
[3431.62 → 3432.02] Thanks.
[3437.40 → 3438.18] Thanks, Josh.
[3439.56 → 3441.42] Well, good morning, everyone.
[3441.86 → 3443.54] Wow, that was fantastic, the baptism.
[3443.68 → 3447.14] That's awesome, and having the kids up front here always on Sunday mornings
[3447.14 → 3448.88] is always great.
[3448.88 → 3452.66] I enjoy this time that I have with the kids up front,
[3452.74 → 3454.74] like Mike sure does, and Kevin and everybody else,
[3454.86 → 3459.74] but it's nice to see that we can try to get the kids to kind of break out
[3459.74 → 3462.00] and speak out in front of the church here,
[3462.04 → 3465.06] because of all the things we can hear in the back there in the back room
[3465.06 → 3467.26] when we're doing children's worship with them.
[3467.32 → 3467.98] It's pretty special.
[3468.18 → 3472.68] So we hope that you get to see a little bit of that innocence
[3472.68 → 3475.88] that we hear in the back that comes out up front here in church.
[3476.12 → 3477.44] So that's great.
[3477.44 → 3477.94] Thank you.
[3478.60 → 3481.38] Today we're going to, right now we're going to do the family prayer,
[3481.68 → 3485.68] and just want to go over a few things that are going on.
[3485.72 → 3490.18] There's lots going on in our community, good things and some sad things.
[3491.12 → 3494.38] Kuiper's family, some blessings that are happening there,
[3494.48 → 3496.18] so you can check in the bulletin about that.
[3496.26 → 3496.86] That's awesome.
[3497.80 → 3501.34] Of course, the baptisms this morning is pretty special.
[3502.78 → 3506.16] Unfortunately, there's been within our community a few deaths that have happened.
[3506.16 → 3511.04] Joanne Miles has a nephew back in Saskatchewan that has passed away of cancer.
[3512.78 → 3516.48] And close to home, Karen Astra's dad has passed away in the last week
[3516.48 → 3518.68] from complications of COVID.
[3519.86 → 3524.90] Some other COVID sadnesses happened.
[3525.16 → 3529.02] Greta Kisser's aunt, Mrs. Telstra, also has passed away,
[3529.02 → 3535.64] as well as Tim Bonks' grandmother, passed away as well in the last week.
[3536.46 → 3539.94] And of course, last week we had Peter Spain and his kids were here,
[3540.04 → 3546.78] so there's some more sadness that is happening there with COVID as well.
[3546.78 → 3552.10] Kevin had mentioned to us that Patrick, Sarah King's brother,
[3552.24 → 3557.26] has had a successful surgery, so that's an item of thanks.
[3558.38 → 3561.68] And there's also a lot of people with COVID that are long haulers,
[3561.78 → 3564.82] like still have respiratory issues that we need to keep in our prayer as well.
[3564.82 → 3569.14] So this week we have classes is happening this week,
[3569.20 → 3571.22] so there's a number of people within from our council,
[3571.42 → 3574.74] as well as Pastor Chris and Kevin maybe,
[3575.40 → 3578.32] going to join classes and participate in that.
[3578.38 → 3582.50] That's a great event for our churches here.
[3582.50 → 3586.96] And we also got to make sure we spend some time thinking about
[3586.96 → 3590.54] those who are isolated, the shut-in, those who are lonely and depressed.
[3590.70 → 3592.10] Like COVID's been hard on a lot of people,
[3592.20 → 3595.80] so we've made all know someone in that kind of situation.
[3595.92 → 3597.08] We've got to keep them in our prayers.
[3598.38 → 3601.58] And with COVID, of course, a lot of people have had their surgeries
[3601.58 → 3603.66] or other health care treatments that have been postponed,
[3603.86 → 3607.24] so that's got to be tough on people when you're expecting to have something happen
[3607.24 → 3610.62] and to better your life, and that gets postponed.
[3610.62 → 3612.74] So let's keep those people in our prayers as well.
[3613.72 → 3617.22] In my prayer today, I'm going to have a little bit of a break in there of silence
[3617.22 → 3620.00] where you can pray for someone in your life
[3620.00 → 3624.38] or that you know that you want to spend some time in prayer thinking about
[3624.38 → 3628.88] and asking God for them to take care of those people.
[3630.08 → 3630.66] Let's pray.
[3631.38 → 3632.64] Dear God, thank you for this day.
[3633.80 → 3637.16] Thank you that we can be here today and worship and fellowship together.
[3638.00 → 3640.28] We're thankful for the children we see this morning
[3640.28 → 3642.22] and for the baptisms we are able to witness.
[3643.06 → 3645.92] We pray, Lord, that all these children will grow up knowing you
[3645.92 → 3649.18] and know that they are your children
[3649.18 → 3652.66] and that they know and feel the support from this church.
[3653.72 → 3657.54] We are thankful, Lord, that life is beginning to get back to somewhat normal
[3657.54 → 3659.84] after a year and a half of COVID restrictions.
[3660.72 → 3664.02] Seeing extracurricular activities like sports and social events come back
[3664.02 → 3666.38] is so encouraging and good for us social beings.
[3666.38 → 3671.36] But this COVID crisis is still taking its toll and taking loved ones from us
[3671.36 → 3673.60] and making others of us very sick.
[3674.22 → 3677.36] We pray for healing and an end to this COVID chapter quickly.
[3678.66 → 3681.34] We are thankful, Lord, for our political and health leaders
[3681.34 → 3684.22] who have been navigating us through this period of unknowns,
[3684.44 → 3688.18] trying to keep us all safe and healthy, both physically and mentally.
[3690.02 → 3692.34] But, Lord, there are many things that we have on our minds
[3692.34 → 3695.42] that cause stress and anxiety and take up a lot of our mental thoughts.
[3696.12 → 3699.60] We all know someone who is sick, hurting, lonely,
[3699.84 → 3701.52] suffering from mental health challenges.
[3702.12 → 3704.62] And then there are those who suffer from hardships every day
[3704.62 → 3706.08] that kind of get lost.
[3707.64 → 3710.24] We want to take a few moments, Lord, right now in silence
[3710.24 → 3712.16] to bring those concerns to you.
[3712.16 → 3712.22] Thank you.
[3712.22 → 3712.28] Thank you.
[3712.28 → 3712.30] Thank you.
[3722.34 → 3732.34] We thank you, Lord, for this church,
[3732.58 → 3735.24] for the volunteers and staff that make this place happen.
[3736.14 → 3739.16] We are blessed to have so many involved in the programs at this church
[3739.16 → 3742.80] to make them run and help facilitate the culture in this congregation.
[3742.80 → 3747.30] We pray for our staff and council as they work to keep the vision
[3747.30 → 3749.00] of this church alive and moving forward.
[3749.90 → 3752.50] We pray for wisdom for these people to navigate the challenges
[3752.50 → 3754.92] and issues that come with being part of this church family.
[3756.96 → 3759.06] Oh, Lord, may we honour you in all we do.
[3760.24 → 3762.86] May we be a light for you in this world we live.
[3763.92 → 3767.44] May people on our path this week see that your Holy Spirit is in us
[3767.44 → 3768.10] in all we do.
[3769.10 → 3771.32] And help us, Lord, not to be Sunday Christians,
[3771.32 → 3773.28] but seven-day-a-week followers of you.
[3774.38 → 3776.12] We ask all these things in your name alone.
[3776.46 → 3776.66] Amen.
[3792.82 → 3794.00] Good morning, everyone.
[3795.34 → 3796.14] Microphone's good, Courtney?
[3796.52 → 3797.20] Sounds good.
[3797.52 → 3798.44] My voice sounds loud.
[3798.44 → 3803.46] So I never had cats or dogs in my house growing up.
[3803.80 → 3805.04] My mom was never really a fan.
[3805.50 → 3808.32] We had fish, sure, and my sister tormented her fair share of hamsters,
[3808.46 → 3810.56] but we didn't really have any pets bigger than my head
[3810.56 → 3812.46] walking around our house when I was young.
[3812.76 → 3813.64] They were too messy.
[3814.00 → 3814.84] They were too much energy.
[3814.94 → 3815.70] They were too much work.
[3816.24 → 3816.80] But that was fine.
[3817.10 → 3817.90] That was fine with me.
[3817.96 → 3819.10] I didn't actually care that much.
[3819.16 → 3821.42] I was a little bit too interested in sports
[3821.42 → 3824.26] to worry about what kind of animals were in our house.
[3824.82 → 3826.98] Me and my brother and my dad, we would watch sports.
[3826.98 → 3828.14] We would play sports.
[3828.22 → 3829.54] We were into fantasy sports.
[3829.62 → 3830.30] I loved all of it.
[3831.14 → 3832.36] And then I met Nikki.
[3833.16 → 3834.00] She loves animals.
[3834.24 → 3836.72] She grew up with cats and dogs in her house all her life.
[3836.94 → 3839.06] She wasn't as into sports as I was, though.
[3839.74 → 3842.48] She said soccer was dumb when we first met.
[3843.92 → 3845.02] That was almost the end.
[3846.82 → 3848.36] Now, in fairness, she was into gymnastics,
[3848.58 → 3849.46] and she played basketball,
[3849.46 → 3851.44] so it's not like sports weren't a part of her life,
[3851.44 → 3853.88] but to watch them or, heaven forbid,
[3853.98 → 3855.48] be a part of fantasy sports,
[3855.48 → 3856.70] that never really crossed her mind.
[3857.30 → 3859.14] We've been married now for 12 years.
[3859.38 → 3862.32] We've just welcomed our second dog into our family
[3862.32 → 3863.56] a couple of months ago.
[3863.64 → 3864.38] His name's Oslo.
[3864.64 → 3866.00] We have a cat, too, named Nala.
[3866.68 → 3868.00] I love our pets, to be honest with you.
[3868.08 → 3868.96] Sounds weird, but it's true.
[3869.00 → 3869.20] I do.
[3869.26 → 3869.96] I love my pets.
[3870.24 → 3871.88] Maybe not as much as Nikki does, but I do.
[3872.00 → 3873.18] I love our dog, our cat.
[3873.22 → 3873.80] We have frogs.
[3874.68 → 3875.56] I love my pets.
[3875.84 → 3877.14] Nikki's come around on soccer, too.
[3877.44 → 3880.02] She's even played on a few soccer teams with me over the years.
[3880.02 → 3883.32] She also just stepped back from playing 10 years of fantasy hockey,
[3883.72 → 3886.10] fairly successful manager in our dynasty hockey pool.
[3887.46 → 3893.38] It turns out you start to love what your loved ones love.
[3894.88 → 3895.72] Think about it.
[3895.72 → 3899.00] We've all been influenced by our parents or our caregivers in this regard.
[3899.26 → 3900.58] We've inherited their hobbies.
[3900.80 → 3902.74] We often follow their passions.
[3903.14 → 3905.06] We love the things our friends love, too.
[3905.38 → 3908.40] You watch Survivor together on Wednesday night.
[3908.40 → 3910.70] You listen to the same music, perhaps.
[3911.16 → 3913.58] Some of you even share clothes with your friends.
[3914.64 → 3917.88] What our loved ones love, we learn to love.
[3917.94 → 3919.46] It's part of being in relationship.
[3920.10 → 3921.52] So think about your own life for a moment.
[3921.62 → 3929.20] What is something you love now that is a direct result of someone you love loving that thing first?
[3930.28 → 3932.00] So just hold on to that for a second.
[3932.08 → 3932.94] It's going to come in handy later.
[3932.94 → 3938.98] For now, though, grab your Bibles, open them up, pull out your phones or whatever devices your Bible's on.
[3939.24 → 3942.96] We're going to look at the second chapter of 1 Peter today.
[3943.08 → 3949.30] We're continuing our series on 1 Peter, and we're going to look at the second chapter right now.
[3949.34 → 3952.02] We're going to read verses 4 through 10.
[3952.02 → 3955.72] So grab those Bibles, open them up, and read with me there.
[3956.62 → 3958.54] 1 Peter 2, 4 to 10 says this.
[3959.88 → 3966.46] As you come to him, the living stone, rejected by humans but chosen by God and precious to him,
[3967.16 → 3973.46] you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood,
[3973.88 → 3978.64] offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
[3978.64 → 3980.66] For in Scripture it says,
[3980.66 → 3985.18] See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone,
[3985.42 → 3988.18] and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.
[3989.14 → 3991.20] Now to you who believe, this stone is precious.
[3992.14 → 3997.74] But to those who don't believe, the stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,
[3998.14 → 4002.16] and a stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall.
[4002.40 → 4008.32] They stumble because they disobey the message, which is also what they were destined for.
[4008.64 → 4018.82] But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession,
[4019.48 → 4024.94] that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into this wonderful light.
[4026.26 → 4029.56] Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God.
[4029.56 → 4034.76] Once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
[4035.56 → 4037.18] The word of the Lord.
[4040.12 → 4046.76] We are the church chosen by God to declare the gospel.
[4048.28 → 4050.58] We are the church.
[4050.78 → 4053.34] There's a lot of imagery in this text today, isn't there?
[4053.34 → 4055.22] Peter, he loves his analogies.
[4055.34 → 4059.16] And often, like today's text, he uses analogies that are layered.
[4059.72 → 4062.50] So in verses 4 and 5 of our text today, for example,
[4062.62 → 4065.84] Jesus is both the cornerstone on which the temple is built,
[4065.98 → 4068.04] but also the builder who builds the temple.
[4068.58 → 4072.70] And we, the readers, the people of God, we are both the temple which he is building,
[4072.96 → 4076.38] but also the priests who operate in the temple.
[4077.72 → 4078.54] It can be tricky.
[4078.62 → 4079.42] It can be confusing.
[4079.42 → 4083.88] So in light of this, let's break down some of this imagery, lay it all out, see how it works,
[4084.04 → 4087.28] and then we'll move on with some of these analogies.
[4088.92 → 4091.20] First, Jesus is called the living stone.
[4091.30 → 4092.52] This is a mixed metaphor.
[4092.80 → 4097.76] Stones, of course, they're solid, they're steadfast, they're unchanging, they're supportive.
[4098.62 → 4101.00] Jesus, though, is the living stone.
[4102.28 → 4104.74] He's stable, he's steadfast, he's foundational,
[4105.16 → 4108.56] but he's also alive, and he's active.
[4109.42 → 4114.04] He's not immobile and stationary, he's involved, and he's engaged.
[4115.26 → 4118.76] Temple imagery dominates verses 4 and 5 of our text.
[4118.84 → 4122.08] The temple was this super large and impressive building,
[4122.16 → 4125.52] a place where God dwelt with his people.
[4125.88 → 4131.50] It's where priests offered sacrifices to atone for the sins of the Israelite community.
[4131.50 → 4137.10] The temple helped the Israelite people identify as God's people.
[4138.34 → 4140.82] So for your notes' sake, here's a breakdown of this.
[4140.92 → 4142.26] Jesus is the living stone.
[4142.52 → 4144.24] He's active, and he's steadfast.
[4144.34 → 4146.80] He's the cornerstone on which his church is founded.
[4147.12 → 4148.38] Jesus is also the architect.
[4148.92 → 4151.62] He's the one building the temple where God dwells.
[4152.02 → 4157.44] The living stones which this temple is built out of is us, the church, God's people.
[4157.44 → 4162.88] Collectively, we are the church, the place where God now dwells.
[4163.70 → 4167.08] And his people, us, the church, we are also the priests
[4167.08 → 4173.02] in charge of offering spiritual sacrifices as our text lays out.
[4173.60 → 4176.62] So all of us are now collectively the holy priesthood.
[4177.28 → 4181.70] We no longer have to offer sacrifices of animals to atone for our sins
[4181.70 → 4185.06] because Christ came into this world and became the ultimate sacrifice.
[4185.06 → 4186.94] He was the atonement for us.
[4187.00 → 4187.78] Our sins are forgiven.
[4188.66 → 4192.86] So because of that sacrifice, instead of offering animal sacrifices,
[4193.04 → 4197.26] we are to offer spiritual sacrifices, as our text says,
[4197.32 → 4201.44] that are acceptable to God because Christ has forgiven us.
[4202.50 → 4205.18] Now, Peter, later, he goes down, and he starts breaking down
[4205.18 → 4208.56] what these spiritual sacrifices are throughout the rest of this chapter.
[4208.70 → 4211.34] And so that will come for a sermon series a little bit later.
[4211.34 → 4215.74] But some of those sacrifices are things like resisting evil, doing good,
[4216.08 → 4221.38] enduring pain and suffering without retaliating, and living holy lives.
[4221.86 → 4222.66] You know, things like that.
[4224.18 → 4227.72] So that's the very embarrassingly brief breakdown of the imagery in our text today.
[4227.76 → 4228.80] But what does this all mean?
[4231.00 → 4233.20] Well, we love what our loved ones love.
[4233.20 → 4237.54] Our text today calls Jesus the cornerstone.
[4238.68 → 4242.06] And his people, his temple.
[4242.90 → 4247.14] In other places in the Word, Jesus is called the head.
[4247.90 → 4249.48] And his people are the body.
[4249.90 → 4250.92] Or maybe you remember this one.
[4251.14 → 4253.12] In other places, Jesus is called the groom.
[4253.68 → 4255.72] And again, his people are the bride.
[4256.72 → 4261.14] In all of those examples, you can't have one without the other.
[4261.14 → 4262.70] A head without a body is useless.
[4263.08 → 4265.50] A groom without a bride is just a man.
[4265.80 → 4269.50] A foundation without a building or a temple is a slab of concrete.
[4270.42 → 4273.64] Jesus loves the church so much so that he died for it.
[4274.24 → 4275.76] He wants to be with us.
[4275.82 → 4276.94] There's a union there.
[4277.02 → 4278.20] He desires that union.
[4278.44 → 4281.66] And he knows that without that union, we are useless.
[4283.02 → 4286.02] Without Jesus, we're a building about to crumble.
[4286.74 → 4289.18] We're a headless body entering rigor mortis.
[4289.18 → 4292.26] We can't be a bride without a groom.
[4295.62 → 4299.46] Unfortunately, in our world today, there are many Christians, both young and old,
[4300.42 → 4304.16] that feel that you can love Jesus without loving the church.
[4305.62 → 4309.12] They lie on empty foundations, but they're exposed to the elements.
[4309.26 → 4313.50] They want the head of Christ, but they are unwilling to be a part of the body.
[4313.50 → 4320.00] They look at the groom with fondness, but they don't want to be a part or be the bride.
[4321.10 → 4324.54] You can't love Jesus without loving the church.
[4324.86 → 4326.90] That's not what relationship is.
[4328.24 → 4329.46] Kevin DeYoung puts it this way.
[4329.54 → 4329.98] It's beautiful.
[4330.14 → 4330.76] It's grotesque.
[4330.80 → 4331.40] But he says this.
[4331.50 → 4334.28] He says, some of us want a depopulated Christianity.
[4334.42 → 4335.02] I love that word.
[4335.28 → 4337.36] A depopulated Christianity.
[4337.36 → 4341.50] Some of us want a decapitated Jesus.
[4343.32 → 4345.54] But you can't have Jesus without the church.
[4345.88 → 4347.08] Jesus loves the church.
[4347.58 → 4348.94] The church loves Jesus.
[4350.60 → 4356.16] We are the church chosen by God to declare the gospel.
[4356.16 → 4361.98] The language used throughout this text is together language.
[4362.12 → 4364.86] This is not I language or me language.
[4364.98 → 4366.64] This is we language.
[4366.84 → 4368.74] We are the church that Jesus is building.
[4369.00 → 4370.26] It's not made out of one stone.
[4370.36 → 4371.66] It's made out of many stones.
[4372.04 → 4373.26] We don't go to church.
[4373.50 → 4375.00] We are the church.
[4375.12 → 4380.20] This church is built up as a community who supports and lifts one another.
[4381.20 → 4384.52] Now, I've witnessed that here at this church, and it's beautiful.
[4384.52 → 4387.58] This community has gone through some trying times.
[4387.70 → 4389.44] It's gone through some celebratory times.
[4389.60 → 4391.58] But through all of it, we've gone through it together.
[4392.74 → 4394.18] That's what church family does.
[4394.64 → 4396.52] When someone's going through something, you show up.
[4396.88 → 4397.88] You pray for them.
[4397.96 → 4399.50] You be present for them.
[4400.86 → 4405.56] You can also trust that when the inevitable day comes, when you're going through something,
[4406.26 → 4408.20] your community will be there for you.
[4408.20 → 4417.58] That's why it's so tragic to see churches get divided over trivial or selfish things like
[4417.58 → 4422.10] foyer furnishings or what songs we sing on Sunday.
[4423.12 → 4427.64] And I'm just going to name it, and people might be mad at this, or masking policies during
[4427.64 → 4428.18] a pandemic.
[4428.18 → 4433.50] We're built together by Christ as his temple.
[4433.78 → 4438.86] We cannot let these little things, these individual things, break us.
[4438.94 → 4441.06] Individual rights, that's I language.
[4442.28 → 4445.34] It should never supersede the communal bond of being the church together.
[4445.70 → 4448.34] We are the church.
[4449.92 → 4451.48] Christ loves the church.
[4451.48 → 4454.50] We must love the church.
[4454.62 → 4457.34] This togetherness language, it continues in verse 9.
[4458.44 → 4460.52] There we read, we are a chosen people.
[4460.74 → 4462.38] We are a royal priesthood.
[4462.54 → 4463.80] We are a holy nation.
[4463.98 → 4466.82] We are God's special possessions.
[4467.50 → 4470.20] We are together.
[4471.42 → 4476.50] We are the church chosen by God to declare the gospel.
[4476.68 → 4478.08] Chosen by God.
[4478.08 → 4484.98] We are God's chosen people together because of what Christ did for us all, right?
[4486.06 → 4491.38] Christ, Jesus Christ, he came to this earth, and he lived the life that we should have all
[4491.38 → 4491.74] lived.
[4492.10 → 4497.06] And then he died the death that we all deserved to die in our place.
[4497.60 → 4500.52] He became the sacrifice for us, atoning for our sin.
[4500.58 → 4507.20] And then three days later, he rose again from the dead, declaring that sin and death had no
[4507.20 → 4508.44] hold on him anymore.
[4509.48 → 4514.90] And now because of that gospel truth of Christ's life, his death, and his resurrection, the
[4514.90 → 4521.96] privilege of Jesus' obedience is now applied to the church, to all of us who believe.
[4521.96 → 4528.60] We are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possessions, so
[4528.60 → 4533.90] that we may declare the praises of him who, again, by his life, death, and resurrection,
[4533.90 → 4535.24] called us out of what?
[4535.24 → 4535.74] Darkness.
[4537.26 → 4539.10] And into his wonderful light.
[4540.84 → 4548.00] This identity of being God's chosen people is highlighted here this morning.
[4548.46 → 4553.92] We baptized April and Dawson and Reuben this morning because they are a part of this promise.
[4554.98 → 4561.10] They have all been chosen by God because, as Galatians 3 says, God's kingdom knows no gender,
[4561.10 → 4563.14] no race, no age.
[4563.96 → 4571.18] Our identity, as Peter says here, is not one we achieve, not one we achieve or accomplish
[4571.18 → 4575.64] ourselves, but our identity is received by God.
[4577.26 → 4579.54] Our identity is that we belong to Jesus.
[4579.68 → 4580.80] We are a chosen people.
[4581.26 → 4582.18] We are the church.
[4582.28 → 4583.22] We are brothers and sisters.
[4583.36 → 4586.24] We are a new creation, as it says in 2 Corinthians.
[4586.42 → 4589.44] We are citizens of heaven, as it says in Philippians 3.
[4589.44 → 4592.44] We are God's children, like it says in 1 John.
[4592.52 → 4596.74] We are heirs of Christ, like it says in Romans.
[4596.96 → 4604.10] Over and over and over again in the Bible, we read about how our identity has been given
[4604.10 → 4606.10] to us by God.
[4607.72 → 4610.12] This is so important right now.
[4610.34 → 4615.50] It's so important in the culture we find ourselves in because in our modern Western culture,
[4615.50 → 4619.18] we obsess about our identities.
[4620.50 → 4626.64] Tim Keller points out some incredible realities on our identities that's being shaped by our
[4626.64 → 4629.78] culture right now, so his voice is going to be entangled in the next five minutes here.
[4631.96 → 4634.84] See, our identities are central to who we are.
[4635.78 → 4638.12] Our identities give us a sense of worth in this world.
[4638.20 → 4643.94] They get to the core of who we are and what makes us valuable in the context we find ourselves
[4643.94 → 4645.94] in.
[4645.94 → 4651.56] The problem is right now, as Christians, it's easy to profess God as our Lord and Saviour,
[4652.56 → 4655.92] but also let culture dictate who you are.
[4656.94 → 4659.72] Also let culture dictate what your identity is.
[4661.34 → 4666.96] We can say we're God's chosen people, but culture more often than not will point us in
[4666.96 → 4668.68] an entirely different direction.
[4668.68 → 4675.90] Historically, traditionally, people used to get their identities from their communities.
[4676.36 → 4679.86] So traditionally, people's identities were rooted in the communities that they lived.
[4679.92 → 4682.60] You were someone's son or someone's daughter.
[4682.74 → 4685.26] You were someone's father or someone's mother.
[4685.38 → 4691.04] You were known as part of a fabric of a town or a village, and you were known in that town
[4691.04 → 4694.02] by the family you were a part of and the company that you kept.
[4694.10 → 4694.92] That was your identity.
[4694.92 → 4696.68] It was a communal identity.
[4697.94 → 4699.86] In our culture, this is drastically different.
[4701.06 → 4705.76] You've been told to look inside yourself to find out who you are.
[4706.68 → 4713.16] You have to look deep within your soul, and there you will find your dreams and your passions.
[4713.52 → 4715.86] You'll find your feelings, your intuitions.
[4716.62 → 4718.12] And then what are you to do with those?
[4719.78 → 4720.72] Express them.
[4721.74 → 4722.80] That's who you are.
[4722.80 → 4725.00] Don't let anyone else define you.
[4727.18 → 4728.02] Find yourself.
[4728.14 → 4730.60] And if you look deep enough, you can discover who you are.
[4731.58 → 4734.64] If you can't, go on a trip and go find yourself.
[4736.98 → 4737.80] Discover yourself.
[4737.94 → 4742.60] Only you can define you, and far be it for anyone else to tell you who you are.
[4743.84 → 4745.24] You can push this further, too.
[4745.34 → 4746.52] Tim Keller uses this language.
[4746.52 → 4749.90] He uses the language of a heroic narrative.
[4750.64 → 4755.16] So again, traditionally, the heroic narrative, the story that made you a hero in traditional
[4755.16 → 4757.16] cultures, was to deny yourself.
[4757.80 → 4762.30] Was to actually deny yourself for the benefit and the purposes of your family and your community.
[4762.30 → 4767.58] If you were to give yourself up for your family or your neighbours, that was honourable.
[4769.02 → 4773.42] The heroic narrative of all culture is not self-denial, though.
[4773.84 → 4774.60] It's the opposite.
[4775.08 → 4778.94] Our heroic narrative in our Western culture is self-declaration.
[4778.94 → 4786.22] People are now praised when they come out and stand up and declare themselves as something
[4786.22 → 4786.98] or someone.
[4787.76 → 4795.12] And they're especially praised if they do this at the expense of oppression or the oppressors,
[4795.46 → 4799.80] which often takes the form of family or society or community.
[4799.80 → 4805.48] In our culture, to think that someone else could name who you are, that someone else could help
[4805.48 → 4810.16] shape you, someone else could form your identity, is villainous, actually.
[4811.14 → 4815.70] But if you can discover yourself, if you can look inside your soul and discover yourself,
[4815.78 → 4821.50] despite the tyranny of your family or society holding you down, that is praised right now
[4821.50 → 4822.06] in our world.
[4822.70 → 4826.44] And then once you discover who you are, you get to go on TikTok or on Instagram or some
[4826.44 → 4829.10] other social media platform and announce it to the world.
[4829.80 → 4835.00] What your newfound identity is, and you get to receive a flood of likes by a community
[4835.00 → 4838.60] that probably doesn't even know you which ironically affirms the decision that you've
[4838.60 → 4840.12] made because community matters.
[4842.38 → 4852.32] The problem is, trying to find your identity within yourself, it's not healthy, and it goes
[4852.32 → 4854.54] against what God's calling on your life is.
[4854.88 → 4856.86] Now, there are a bunch of reasons why, but we'll list two.
[4856.86 → 4865.16] Firstly, looking within myself to my own passions, my own feelings, my own intuitions, to find
[4865.16 → 4867.12] an identity is unstable.
[4869.06 → 4876.52] My, Kevin's, me, my feelings, my passions, my intuitions have changed with the seasons,
[4876.66 → 4878.52] it seems, as I grow older.
[4878.52 → 4880.94] Yours all do, too.
[4882.22 → 4886.14] 20-year-olds out there, if you're 20 years old, how many of you can look back at yourself
[4886.14 → 4888.36] at the age of 15 and be like, yeah, I had it all together.
[4888.96 → 4889.64] I knew life.
[4889.70 → 4891.28] I wasn't doing anything dumb at 15.
[4891.52 → 4892.72] I dare you to raise your hand.
[4893.76 → 4895.52] 30-year-olds, look back at when you were 20.
[4895.60 → 4896.44] Do you say the same thing?
[4896.66 → 4899.50] You look back at yourself at 20 and be like, no, I had it sorted back then.
[4900.06 → 4900.64] I had life.
[4900.64 → 4900.94] No.
[4902.08 → 4907.76] 50-year-olds, have your feelings, your convictions, your personal views, have they stayed completely
[4907.76 → 4909.38] constant over the last 20 years?
[4910.82 → 4911.72] No, of course not.
[4912.24 → 4915.64] I'm not even going to ask the 60 to 100-year-olds in the crowd here today because they're going
[4915.64 → 4916.30] to roll their eyes at me.
[4917.04 → 4918.70] No, of course not.
[4918.70 → 4924.28] Our convictions, our opinions, our feelings, our passions, they change as our lives evolve.
[4925.18 → 4926.20] This happens to all of us.
[4926.26 → 4927.38] We discover new things.
[4927.82 → 4931.82] What once brought joy now brings pain and vice versa.
[4932.94 → 4936.20] Love we once knew may now be gone.
[4936.48 → 4941.08] And things we never knew before now may be the most important things in our lives.
[4941.14 → 4941.92] That's life.
[4943.42 → 4946.56] Ask any of the parents who just baptized their baby this morning.
[4948.70 → 4950.16] Life changes.
[4951.44 → 4959.14] Looking inward to your feelings and passions and intuitions to form your identity is fickle
[4959.14 → 4959.84] at best.
[4961.26 → 4962.26] God created us.
[4962.40 → 4965.02] God created life way too complex for that.
[4967.00 → 4974.60] Secondly, an identity that's achieved rather than received is exclusive by nature.
[4974.60 → 4981.08] We can't base our identities on the things that we accomplish because that either elevates
[4981.08 → 4982.26] or deflates us.
[4982.82 → 4983.42] Think about it.
[4983.44 → 4986.72] Maybe you're the best soccer player in your school growing up.
[4987.18 → 4988.20] You play often.
[4988.32 → 4989.34] You realize, hey, I'm good.
[4989.56 → 4990.34] I love soccer.
[4990.38 → 4991.06] I'm a soccer player.
[4991.48 → 4992.06] I'm the best.
[4992.80 → 4995.24] Then you graduate high school, and you go to university and uh-oh.
[4996.38 → 4997.52] You're not the best anymore.
[4998.28 → 4999.62] You actually, you barely made the team.
[4999.62 → 5002.82] That Christmas comes, and you go down to Mexico.
[5002.94 → 5003.44] You need a break.
[5003.50 → 5004.14] You're on a vacation.
[5004.32 → 5005.34] You walk into a little town.
[5005.92 → 5008.16] You realize, oh no, there's 10-year-olds playing soccer here.
[5008.90 → 5009.94] They're better than I.
[5011.78 → 5017.54] Your identity as a soccer player is based purely on your skill level compared to everyone
[5017.54 → 5018.34] else around you.
[5019.26 → 5024.20] Your confidence in your identity now starts waning every time you see someone better than
[5024.20 → 5024.38] you.
[5025.84 → 5028.10] That's what achieving your own identity does.
[5028.10 → 5030.24] It pits you against the rest of humanity.
[5030.68 → 5033.30] You feel better so long as you're trashing other people.
[5034.04 → 5040.12] As long as people aren't as skilled or enlightened or hardworking or insightful, you feel pretty
[5040.12 → 5040.44] good.
[5042.68 → 5048.72] But when others come around who are better or more insightful, or they work harder, or they're
[5048.72 → 5053.84] more enlightened, seemingly, that's the pressing that deflates you.
[5053.84 → 5059.10] Finding our identities within ourselves is fickle.
[5059.36 → 5062.76] Trying to achieve our own identities is exclusive to everyone else.
[5064.80 → 5067.88] But rather than doing either, we need to look to Christ as our example.
[5068.52 → 5070.20] Philippians 2, verse 7, it says this.
[5070.26 → 5071.56] Get this from the King James Version.
[5071.56 → 5076.92] He says, Jesus came down and made himself of no reputation.
[5078.12 → 5081.02] Made himself of no reputation.
[5081.72 → 5085.04] He became a servant, and he humbled himself.
[5086.24 → 5090.36] And obeyed God right up until death on a cross.
[5090.36 → 5097.50] We look inwards and try to build ourselves up that way, build our identities that way.
[5097.54 → 5099.10] We try to grow our reputation.
[5099.58 → 5101.72] And Jesus came to the earth and did the exact opposite.
[5102.36 → 5103.16] He looked outwards.
[5104.76 → 5109.68] He saw what we were mired in, and he came down, and he made himself of no reputation to save
[5109.68 → 5110.02] us.
[5111.50 → 5112.90] And he knew he was chosen.
[5112.90 → 5117.94] Peter is saying in our text today that you know who you are.
[5118.74 → 5123.36] You don't need to dig deep within yourself or build your identities by comparing yourself
[5123.36 → 5124.40] to the world around you.
[5125.18 → 5128.80] You are a chosen people, a holy nation.
[5128.96 → 5132.14] Our identities are achieved, are not achieved, sorry.
[5132.62 → 5133.58] They are received.
[5134.70 → 5135.14] Hallelujah.
[5137.72 → 5141.72] We are a God who says we are a chosen, holy, and we are precious.
[5143.30 → 5146.42] This truth needs to permeate our hearts regularly.
[5146.54 → 5148.82] That's why we're called to pray regularly.
[5148.94 → 5150.70] That's why we're called to read the word.
[5150.82 → 5152.04] That's why we're called to fast.
[5152.34 → 5156.28] That's why we're called to come together and gather as a community because we need to
[5156.28 → 5159.36] be constantly reminded that our identity is in Christ.
[5159.68 → 5160.82] We belong to him.
[5163.74 → 5164.92] And we are called to go.
[5166.54 → 5171.84] We are the church chosen by God to declare the gospel.
[5171.84 → 5174.92] Notice what our text says here.
[5175.70 → 5180.06] It says, we are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession that
[5180.06 → 5180.78] we may, what?
[5182.36 → 5187.28] Declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.
[5188.06 → 5189.76] And this is the final point, so stay with me here.
[5189.76 → 5194.64] So often we use this terminology of sharing the gospel.
[5194.90 → 5195.92] Go share the gospel.
[5196.96 → 5199.50] I've come to learn that this language actually is a bit of a problem.
[5200.42 → 5204.50] Sharing implies that there is a willing recipient.
[5204.50 → 5208.90] So if I tell my kids to share their toys, it's because one kid feels left out.
[5209.30 → 5213.70] If I'm sharing my money with someone who is in need, they're willing to receive it because
[5213.70 → 5214.30] they're in need.
[5215.46 → 5220.60] If we are sharing stories, people are willing to hear it because they're listening.
[5221.98 → 5228.66] The act of sharing implies that the person we are sharing it with is willing to receive
[5228.66 → 5230.02] it, to accept it.
[5230.02 → 5234.28] And I think that's how we approach our mission here on this earth.
[5234.38 → 5239.00] We won't share the gospel with someone unless we know they're willing to receive it.
[5240.32 → 5244.60] We don't want to push people too hard, and we definitely don't want to feel uncomfortable
[5244.60 → 5250.04] ourselves, so only share with people who want to hear it.
[5250.78 → 5254.36] Or we default to hoping that our actions will just do the job for us, and we don't have to
[5254.36 → 5255.18] open our mouths at all.
[5255.18 → 5262.24] Unfortunately, that means that we miss opportunities to declare his praises, like our text says today.
[5262.76 → 5267.18] We wait for these moments where the one who needs to hear this news is good and ready to
[5267.18 → 5267.84] hear this news.
[5268.50 → 5270.58] And that moment might never come.
[5272.84 → 5275.34] Brothers and sisters, we are not called to share the gospel.
[5276.82 → 5279.64] We're called to declare the gospel.
[5279.64 → 5282.94] The receptivity?
[5283.94 → 5284.34] Receptivity.
[5284.90 → 5285.48] That's the word.
[5285.62 → 5290.10] The receptivity of our audience does not play into this equation.
[5291.42 → 5295.60] Now, obviously, I'm not saying that we should all go by bullhorns and stand on the corner
[5295.60 → 5301.38] of the street and shout into these things and sin-shame strangers into turning to God lest
[5301.38 → 5302.92] they burn in a pit of hell forever.
[5302.92 → 5303.42] No.
[5305.26 → 5312.20] What I'm saying is, we all have someone we can think of right now.
[5313.42 → 5316.94] Someone who needs to hear this news.
[5317.10 → 5323.10] Someone who needs to hear that Jesus lived and died and rose again for them.
[5324.38 → 5329.58] And that their identities are secured in him because of that truth.
[5329.58 → 5336.16] Jesus, you're all thinking of someone right now who needs to hear that Jesus loves them.
[5337.38 → 5340.08] That Jesus loves them so much that he died for them.
[5341.94 → 5348.20] You're all thinking of someone right now, and you might be waiting to share this news with
[5348.20 → 5350.54] them until they're ready to hear it.
[5350.54 → 5362.18] But what Peter is saying here is that waiting for them to be more receptive is not for you to worry about.
[5364.14 → 5370.40] You are called to declare God's praises no matter the audience.
[5370.40 → 5376.98] And so, I have a challenge for you today.
[5377.74 → 5383.10] Actually, God has a calling for you, is a better way to say it.
[5384.30 → 5391.74] Whoever was on your heart before, whoever it is that you know needs to hear God's love,
[5392.58 → 5396.70] whoever needs to hear about Jesus' life and death and resurrection,
[5396.70 → 5401.06] whoever needs to hear of your story of God's faithfulness in your life,
[5401.82 → 5406.44] you're calling this week is to go and declare it to them.
[5408.34 → 5411.98] So we collectively, as a church, this week, we are going to go out and have at least
[5411.98 → 5416.24] 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 40, 250,
[5416.64 → 5420.26] 180 online, 250 conversations this week.
[5421.00 → 5422.70] That is what we as a church are going to do.
[5422.70 → 5428.76] Maybe it's a sibling or a cousin or a son or a daughter or a parent
[5428.76 → 5430.90] or a parent on your kid's soccer team
[5430.90 → 5433.98] or a colleague you know at work that you see every day.
[5436.56 → 5438.52] Right now, this text is calling you
[5438.52 → 5441.08] to go and declare God's praises to them.
[5444.04 → 5446.28] And so we're going to go have those conversations this week.
[5447.02 → 5448.70] No matter how old you are here today,
[5448.78 → 5449.88] no matter your comfort zone,
[5450.24 → 5452.28] no matter if you like being challenged at church or not,
[5452.70 → 5457.74] we're going to go and declare God's praises.
[5459.00 → 5460.96] And Pastor Chris and I are going to follow up this week.
[5462.30 → 5463.44] You're looking for it later,
[5464.02 → 5465.70] but we're going to reach out to all of you
[5465.70 → 5466.68] and we're going to hold you to this.
[5467.24 → 5468.86] We want to hear these stories,
[5469.16 → 5471.52] not just to like to check off a box,
[5471.88 → 5473.82] but because it's important to hear these stories
[5473.82 → 5475.38] so that we can share them with each other
[5475.38 → 5477.82] and spur each other on to keep doing this.
[5478.62 → 5480.42] We want to lift each other up.
[5480.42 → 5483.78] No matter how well these conversations go
[5483.78 → 5485.24] or how poorly they go in your eyes,
[5485.78 → 5488.32] we want to encourage each other
[5488.32 → 5489.84] and lift each other up with these stories.
[5489.94 → 5492.62] We are the church chosen by God
[5492.62 → 5496.46] to declare the gospel together.
[5496.46 → 5499.12] And so,
[5499.60 → 5504.90] declare God's name to whomever was on your heart this week.
[5506.90 → 5508.02] We are the church.
[5508.78 → 5509.06] Check.
[5510.62 → 5511.82] Chosen by God.
[5512.40 → 5513.10] Identity, right.
[5513.74 → 5514.08] Check.
[5514.92 → 5518.42] To declare the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[5518.42 → 5518.50] Christ.
[5519.94 → 5521.48] That's the to-do this week.
[5522.32 → 5523.36] It's only one item long,
[5523.72 → 5525.54] but as our mission statement says,
[5525.74 → 5526.30] we've gathered,
[5527.24 → 5528.14] hopefully we've grown,
[5529.04 → 5530.02] but now we must go.
[5531.04 → 5532.50] With God as our cornerstone,
[5532.60 → 5534.68] let us declare his name.
[5534.82 → 5535.00] Amen?
[5536.00 → 5536.68] Let me pray.
[5536.68 → 5540.80] Father in heaven,
[5541.00 → 5542.06] we are the church,
[5542.24 → 5543.56] your chosen people.
[5543.92 → 5544.90] God, we are grateful
[5544.90 → 5546.74] that you have built us up.
[5546.80 → 5548.62] We are grateful that you have lived
[5548.62 → 5550.94] a life that we all should have lived
[5550.94 → 5552.64] and yet died in our place
[5552.64 → 5554.28] to forgive us from sin.
[5554.36 → 5555.50] We thank you for the cross,
[5555.76 → 5556.76] for the empty tomb,
[5557.04 → 5558.22] that you have been lifted
[5558.22 → 5560.40] to sit at the right hand of God.
[5560.84 → 5561.08] And Lord,
[5561.20 → 5562.48] in that story,
[5562.62 → 5563.36] in that truth,
[5563.36 → 5565.40] you have also built us up
[5565.40 → 5567.12] and saved us.
[5568.66 → 5569.18] And so God,
[5569.22 → 5570.12] as your church
[5570.12 → 5572.24] that you have chosen,
[5573.14 → 5573.38] God,
[5573.42 → 5574.40] we pray that this week
[5574.40 → 5575.50] you will give us the courage,
[5575.88 → 5576.50] the encouragement,
[5576.64 → 5577.30] the conviction,
[5578.30 → 5579.54] the willingness
[5579.54 → 5582.52] to go and declare your praises.
[5583.52 → 5584.02] God,
[5584.08 → 5585.34] may your name be heard
[5585.34 → 5586.86] throughout our community this week.
[5587.86 → 5589.66] And we pray for your Holy Spirit
[5589.66 → 5591.06] to guide our hearts
[5591.06 → 5591.90] and our words
[5591.90 → 5592.74] and more importantly,
[5592.74 → 5594.18] stir in the hearts
[5594.18 → 5594.80] of the people
[5594.80 → 5595.82] whom we are speaking to.
[5599.68 → 5600.24] And God,
[5600.30 → 5601.68] may you transform people this week.
[5603.62 → 5604.70] We pray this in your name.
[5605.02 → 5605.20] Amen.
[5605.20 → 5605.30] Amen.
[5619.18 → 5620.18] Please join us.
[5622.74 → 5635.96] My hope is built
[5635.96 → 5639.42] on nothing less
[5639.42 → 5642.68] than Jesus' blood
[5642.68 → 5644.64] and righteousness.
[5644.64 → 5649.08] I dare not trust
[5649.08 → 5651.08] the sweetest frame
[5651.08 → 5657.02] but only trust
[5657.02 → 5660.46] in Jesus' name.
[5660.46 → 5661.46] trust in Jesus' name.
[5661.46 → 5668.90] I dare not trust
[5668.90 → 5672.84] the sweetest frame
[5672.84 → 5676.84] but only trust in Jesus' name.
[5676.84 → 5677.84] trust in Jesus' name.
[5677.84 → 5682.28] I dare not trust
[5682.28 → 5685.22] the sweetest frame
[5685.22 → 5689.10] but only trust
[5689.10 → 5691.28] in Jesus' name.
[5691.28 → 5697.28] Christ alone,
[5697.28 → 5701.28] cornerstone,
[5701.28 → 5702.28] Lord of all.
[5702.28 → 5703.28] He is Lord,
[5703.28 → 5705.66] Lord of all.
[5705.66 → 5709.10] In the Saviour's love
[5709.10 → 5712.20] through the storm.
[5712.20 → 5715.92] He is Lord,
[5715.92 → 5720.80] Lord of all.
[5720.80 → 5721.80] Lord of all.
[5721.80 → 5722.80] Lord of all.
[5722.80 → 5723.80] Lord of all.
[5723.80 → 5724.80] Lord of all.
[5724.80 → 5725.80] Lord of all.
[5725.80 → 5727.80] When darkness seems
[5727.80 → 5731.24] to hide His face,
[5731.24 → 5738.30] I rest on His unchanging grace.
[5738.30 → 5745.30] In every high and stormy gale,
[5745.30 → 5751.30] My anchor holds within the veil.
[5751.30 → 5758.30] My anchor holds within the veil.
[5758.30 → 5764.30] Christ alone,
[5764.30 → 5767.30] cornerstone,
[5767.30 → 5770.30] Weak made strong
[5770.30 → 5775.30] In the Saviour's love
[5775.30 → 5778.30] Through the storm.
[5778.30 → 5781.30] He is Lord,
[5781.30 → 5785.30] Lord of all.
[5785.30 → 5786.30] He is Lord,
[5786.30 → 5787.30] Lord of all.
[5787.30 → 5800.30] He shall come
[5800.30 → 5804.30] With trumpet sound,
[5804.30 → 5808.30] O may I then
[5808.30 → 5810.30] In Him be found,
[5810.30 → 5817.30] In His righteousness alone.
[5817.30 → 5823.30] All they stand before the throne.
[5823.30 → 5825.30] Christ alone,
[5825.30 → 5827.30] Cornerstone,
[5827.30 → 5830.30] Weak made strong
[5830.30 → 5843.30] In the Saviour's love
[5843.30 → 5847.30] Through the storm.
[5847.30 → 5850.30] He is Lord,
[5850.30 → 5855.30] Lord of all.
[5855.30 → 5857.30] Lord of all.
[5857.30 → 5860.30] Christ alone,
[5860.30 → 5861.30] Cornerstone,
[5861.30 → 5865.30] Weak made strong
[5865.30 → 5868.30] In the Saviour's love
[5868.30 → 5871.30] In the Saviour's love
[5871.30 → 5873.30] Through the storm.
[5873.30 → 5878.30] He is Lord,
[5878.30 → 5880.30] Lord of all.
[5880.30 → 5881.30] Lord of all.
[5881.30 → 5885.30] Lord of all.
[5885.30 → 5889.30] In the Saviour's love
[5889.30 → 5890.30] And so,
[5892.30 → 5894.30] As we go out today,
[5894.30 → 5895.30] 2-50 to my left,
[5895.30 → 5897.30] and 1-1 or 2-1 or 2-1.
[5898.30 → 5899.30] Nope. Yeah, there we are.
[5899.30 → 5900.30] I'm going to hold this.
[5900.30 → 5902.30] As we go out into this week,
[5902.30 → 5905.30] into the lives that God has placed you,
[5905.30 → 5906.30] into the communities that He has placed you,
[5906.30 → 5908.30] and to go declare His praises,
[5908.30 → 5912.30] please go with God's parting blessing.
[5912.30 → 5915.38] the Lord bless you and keep you.
[5915.98 → 5918.54] The Lord make his face shine upon you
[5918.54 → 5920.28] and be gracious to you.
[5920.94 → 5923.60] The Lord turn his face toward you
[5923.60 → 5926.20] and give you his peace.
[5927.20 → 5929.72] And all of God's chosen people said,
[5929.72 → 5931.00] Amen.
[5931.00 → 5943.98] Should nothing of our efforts stand,
[5943.98 → 5948.78] no legacy survive.
[5950.94 → 5957.80] Unless the Lord does raise the house,
[5957.80 → 5964.30] in vain its builders strive.
[5965.12 → 5971.46] To you who boast tomorrow's gain,
[5971.84 → 5977.88] tell me what is your life?
[5977.88 → 5985.08] A mist that vanishes at dawn,
[5985.08 → 5991.66] all glory be to Christ.
[5991.66 → 5999.06] All glory be to Christ our King,
[5999.06 → 6005.80] all glory be to Christ.
[6005.80 → 6013.06] His rule and reign will ever sing,
[6013.06 → 6019.82] all glory be to Christ.
[6019.82 → 6027.08] His will be done,
[6027.08 → 6030.34] His kingdom come,
[6030.34 → 6035.72] on earth as it is above.
[6037.02 → 6043.92] Who is himself our daily bread?
[6043.92 → 6050.50] Praise him, the Lord of love.
[6050.50 → 6057.50] Let living water satisfy
[6057.50 → 6063.82] the thirsty without price.
[6063.82 → 6070.76] will take a cup of kindness yet,
[6070.76 → 6077.14] all glory be to Christ.
[6077.14 → 6084.10] All glory be to Christ our King,
[6084.34 → 6090.40] all glory be to Christ.
[6090.40 → 6097.16] His rule and reign will ever sing,
[6097.16 → 6103.72] all glory be to Christ.
[6103.72 → 6113.70] When on that day the great I am,
[6113.70 → 6118.70] the faithful and the truth.
[6118.70 → 6125.70] The Lamb who was for sinners slain,
[6125.70 → 6132.18] His making all things new.
[6132.18 → 6138.94] Behold, our God shall live with us,
[6138.94 → 6144.84] and be our steadfast light.
[6144.84 → 6151.38] And we shall bear His people be,
[6151.38 → 6158.38] all glory be to Christ.
[6158.38 → 6164.58] All glory be to Christ our King,
[6164.58 → 6171.02] all glory be to Christ.
[6171.02 → 6178.02] His rule and reign will ever sing,
[6178.02 → 6186.02] all glory be to Christ.
[6186.02 → 6196.82] wholesale work of hearing we be.
[6196.82 → 6226.80] Thank you.
[6226.82 → 6256.80] Thank you.
[6256.82 → 6258.82] Thank you.
