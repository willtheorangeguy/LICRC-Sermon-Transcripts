• Interpretation of the word "test" in the context of suffering as a Christian
• Explanation of the contrast between worldly expectations and Christian response to suffering
• Peter explains that Christians should not be surprised by trials and suffering
• The purpose of a test or trial is redefined from "proving our faith to God" to "proving our faith genuine or making it stronger"
• A test is compared to setting a personal best in weightlifting, where the focus is on personal growth rather than external validation
• Trials can be opportunities for Christians to rejoice and participate in the sufferings of Christ
• Being insulted or ridiculed for being Christian can be a blessing, as it means the spirit of glory and God rests on them
• The glory of Jesus is found in both his crucifixion (cross) and resurrection (crown)
• The cross precedes the crown, as demonstrated by Philippians 2
• There can be no resurrection or exaltation without the cross
• The glory of the cross is a necessary step to reach the glory of the crown
• Many people want to experience the glory of the crown without going through the pain and sacrifice of the cross.
• The glory of the cross is what brings the glory of the crown
• Christians live in hope with a living hope
• There is peace that surpasses all understanding for Christians
• The blessing from God is not about having a "best life now" but rather a future reward
• The crown comes at and with the cross, which is insulted by some but brings blessings to those who are persecuted for Christ's name
• The same spirit of glory and God that rested on Jesus when he condescended to us rests on believers today
• The early church and apostles were filled with the Holy Spirit and suffered persecution for preaching the full gospel of Jesus
• The cross and crown will always be seen as folly and a stumbling block by those who do not believe, but are the power and wisdom of God to those being saved.
• The gospel is the power of God unto salvation for all who believe
• Suffering can be seen as a reason to rejoice, as it produces perseverance and character, leading to hope
• Those who suffer with Christ will also share in his glory
• Believers are children of God and co-heirs with Christ
• The cross is necessary to receive the crown of glory
• Some Bible teachers may claim that one can have the crown without suffering the cross, but this is not true
• Being a Christian may cost one's job, popularity, power, and status
• The cross and the crown (eternal reward) come together in the life of Jesus
• Persecution for Christ is a blessing and a sign of being a true follower
• Don't settle for a lesser crown due to shame or fear of the cross
• The importance of not being ashamed of the gospel and declaring it
• Suffering with others, knowing that the trial and test are not for one's own sake alone
• The presence and power of the Holy Spirit in believers, transforming them into the image of Christ
• Not being surprised by suffering or trials, but instead rejoicing in them as a right struggle
• Distinguishing between persecution and the infringement of rights, emphasizing that Christians should not be defined by external circumstances
• The concept of being a "meddler" in English is discussed, with the Greek word meaning a busy body who involves themselves in others' affairs without expertise or warrant.
• Being a meddler can lead to suffering and trials, but if one's intentions are to stand with Jesus, they should not suffer for being a meddler.
• The speaker believes that persecution of Christians will increase and is already happening in the world today.
• A generation of young Christians is rising up who will face this reality, while those over 50 or 60 may be exempt due to their status and relative comfort.
