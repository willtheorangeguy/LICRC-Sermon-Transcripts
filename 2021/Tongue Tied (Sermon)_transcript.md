[0.00 --> 5.88]  This morning we are continuing our look at the book of James.
[6.28 --> 10.70]  So if you have a Bible handy, I invite you to grab that or turn it on or whatever the
[10.70 --> 16.50]  case may be for you, where you're at, to get your coffee cup and your notebook.
[16.96 --> 20.60]  And we're going to dig into James 3 together.
[20.76 --> 22.56]  I'm going to read verse 1 through 12.
[22.74 --> 26.96]  It will be on the screen, but as always, of course, I encourage you to have it there in
[26.96 --> 27.34]  front of you.
[28.04 --> 29.20]  From James 3.
[30.00 --> 37.88]  Not many of you should become teachers, my fellow believers, because you know that we
[37.88 --> 40.76]  who teach will be judged more strictly.
[42.14 --> 44.20]  We all stumble in many ways.
[45.16 --> 49.96]  Anyone who is never at fault in what they say is perfect, able to keep their whole body
[49.96 --> 50.48]  in check.
[51.58 --> 57.62]  When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal
[57.62 --> 60.44]  or take ships as an example.
[61.44 --> 67.74]  Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small
[67.74 --> 69.72]  rudder wherever the pilot wants to go.
[70.88 --> 75.76]  Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts.
[76.50 --> 80.50]  Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark.
[80.50 --> 85.88]  The tongue is also a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body.
[86.52 --> 92.24]  It corrupts the whole body, sets the whole course of one's life on fire, and is itself
[92.24 --> 94.62]  set on fire by hell.
[96.30 --> 101.88]  All kinds of animals, birds and reptiles and sea creatures are being tamed and have been tamed
[101.88 --> 102.56]  by mankind.
[102.56 --> 105.68]  But no human being can tame the tongue.
[105.86 --> 110.02]  It is a restless evil full of deadly poison.
[112.22 --> 121.20]  With the tongue, we praise our Lord and Father, and with it, we curse human beings who have
[121.20 --> 122.74]  been made in God's image.
[123.92 --> 126.98]  Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing.
[127.94 --> 130.64]  My brothers and sisters, this should not be.
[130.64 --> 134.16]  Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring?
[134.86 --> 139.90]  My brothers and sisters, can a fig tree bear olives or a grapevine bear figs?
[140.76 --> 145.14]  Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water.
[145.78 --> 147.06]  This is the word of the Lord.
[154.12 --> 159.46]  When I was a kid, and it's probably still true today, although I haven't heard it in a
[159.46 --> 163.14]  while, we used to have this saying, and maybe you know it.
[163.20 --> 167.18]  In fact, at home, I encourage you to finish the thought.
[168.28 --> 176.84]  Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words or names will never hurt me.
[178.14 --> 179.86]  Words can never hurt me.
[179.86 --> 181.86]  But let's be real.
[181.86 --> 183.36]  But let's be real for a minute.
[184.66 --> 188.60]  Because I don't actually remember the last time sticks and stones hurt me.
[189.88 --> 193.76]  And I'm quite sure that sticks and stones have never broken any of my bones.
[194.34 --> 197.38]  But man, words have hurt me.
[199.26 --> 201.24]  Words can hurt.
[201.24 --> 209.96]  Truth is, the most common weapon that's ever used against you in life is someone's tongue.
[211.50 --> 217.52]  Whether it's gossip behind your back or slander to your face or angry words spoken in haste
[217.52 --> 219.30]  or name-calling and disrespect.
[221.58 --> 226.52]  And here's the thing that even James, in writing this letter, couldn't have seen coming.
[226.52 --> 229.74]  It's not just spoken words these days.
[230.72 --> 233.72]  There are texts sent out in friend groups.
[233.88 --> 236.44]  There are Snapchats flying around a high school.
[236.60 --> 239.82]  There are messenger posts or Facebook pages or Twitter and Instagram.
[240.44 --> 245.36]  Words spoken or typed or tagged cut deep.
[246.96 --> 251.48]  Most of us, probably all of us, have experienced it.
[251.48 --> 255.60]  And let's be really real.
[256.04 --> 261.06]  Because most of us, at some point or another, are probably also guilty doing it.
[264.68 --> 269.84]  But James has, for us, a more beautiful way.
[270.26 --> 275.40]  There's a more beautiful reality into which we are called to live and experience.
[275.40 --> 285.64]  The real faith expression of being hearers and doers of the word is going to change your use of words.
[288.28 --> 293.30]  Here's the sort of big banner theme that I want us to see today.
[293.30 --> 301.34]  Your speech, at the way you talk, the words you use, what you say, and how you say it,
[301.68 --> 307.48]  your speech is the barometer of your make-it-real faith.
[309.06 --> 312.30]  Real hearers of the word and doers of the word,
[312.82 --> 319.62]  and maybe the first way that we are hearers and doers has to do with the way we talk.
[319.62 --> 324.32]  Your speech is the barometer of your faith.
[325.18 --> 330.42]  And really, I'm adding to the list of metaphors that James uses to help us understand
[330.42 --> 334.56]  that the role your speech plays in reflecting a real faith.
[335.62 --> 339.52]  But maybe not everyone is really clear what a barometer is.
[340.60 --> 344.52]  A barometer is an instrument that's used to measure air pressure.
[344.52 --> 350.28]  So the speech you use reflects the pressures you are under.
[351.12 --> 355.14]  Cultural pressure to conform, peer pressure to look and sound a certain way,
[355.64 --> 357.70]  social pressure to do certain things.
[358.06 --> 362.04]  The anxiety of life is reflected in how we talk.
[363.76 --> 369.66]  And a barometer is used to forecast weather changes.
[369.66 --> 375.50]  Changes in air pressure are indicative of a new system coming in.
[375.88 --> 379.30]  You've probably experienced the pressure change before it rains.
[379.44 --> 381.40]  Some people get headaches because of it.
[381.52 --> 384.50]  Or I've met people who get sore knees, and their knees are sore,
[384.62 --> 386.04]  and they go, oh, it's going to rain in two days.
[387.64 --> 391.58]  Changing air pressure can reveal what weather is coming.
[391.70 --> 393.80]  And it's the same thing with your tongue.
[393.80 --> 402.12]  Your language one moment can be a pretty accurate picture of your attitude and your behavior in another moment.
[403.02 --> 406.80]  For instance, the way that you talk about your employer,
[407.44 --> 409.90]  or the way that you talk about that girl in homeroom,
[410.14 --> 413.54]  is indicative of what you will be like towards them,
[413.70 --> 417.84]  or indicative of what you will be like about them to others.
[418.70 --> 421.48]  Your tongue says a lot about you.
[423.80 --> 428.76]  And so, I think it's good for us to start in this text at the beginning.
[429.82 --> 432.04]  So, verse 1, we read,
[433.50 --> 438.64]  We know that we who teach will be judged more strictly.
[440.82 --> 443.36]  As a preacher and teacher of the Bible,
[443.90 --> 446.06]  this verse can scare me,
[446.66 --> 448.94]  or it can actually embolden me.
[448.94 --> 453.02]  Precisely because I believe that it is true,
[453.34 --> 457.50]  it makes me take the task of preaching and teaching more seriously.
[457.76 --> 460.10]  And so, I labor, and I dig deep,
[460.30 --> 461.94]  and I prayerfully reflect,
[462.10 --> 462.72]  and I study,
[463.08 --> 463.60]  and I read,
[463.70 --> 466.32]  and then I invite you into the same
[466.32 --> 467.26]  to check me,
[467.34 --> 468.48]  and to hold me accountable.
[469.04 --> 470.50]  That's what you will hear me say.
[470.68 --> 471.24]  Things like,
[471.34 --> 472.26]  check it out for yourself,
[472.40 --> 474.18]  or dig into this yourself.
[474.34 --> 475.06]  Follow up on it.
[475.06 --> 475.78]  And if you disagree,
[476.04 --> 476.64]  email me,
[476.74 --> 477.18]  call me.
[477.40 --> 478.70]  Let's have coffee together.
[479.02 --> 480.32]  Because I need you,
[480.40 --> 481.90]  and we need you,
[481.94 --> 483.22]  and we all need each other
[483.22 --> 485.52]  in the mix of this discernment
[485.52 --> 486.66]  of the Word
[486.66 --> 488.36]  and application of the Word.
[488.48 --> 490.46]  That's how we grow together.
[492.06 --> 494.22]  I need you to hold me accountable
[494.22 --> 496.66]  because of what James says,
[496.66 --> 500.84]  but not because I'm afraid of judgment,
[502.20 --> 504.86]  but because the gospel really is
[504.86 --> 506.80]  the power of God unto salvation
[506.80 --> 508.04]  for all who believe,
[508.10 --> 509.80]  and I am not ashamed of that.
[510.00 --> 511.10]  And you better believe,
[511.20 --> 512.16]  because that is true,
[512.30 --> 513.52]  that I want to get it right,
[514.00 --> 515.28]  and that we want to get it right.
[516.86 --> 517.88]  My words,
[518.04 --> 519.06]  as a preacher and teacher,
[519.26 --> 520.92]  are only effective,
[521.60 --> 524.46]  are only applicable in your life,
[524.46 --> 527.20]  insofar as they are the voice of Jesus
[527.20 --> 528.26]  to your heart.
[529.40 --> 530.68]  I must decrease,
[531.18 --> 532.28]  and He must increase.
[533.28 --> 535.86]  I hold out the Word of life
[535.86 --> 537.78]  so that you can shine like stars
[537.78 --> 541.54]  in this present darkness of the universe.
[542.80 --> 545.14]  And that God will judge me as a teacher
[545.14 --> 548.00]  inspires me to faithfulness,
[548.14 --> 551.18]  and I hope that He and we do the same, right?
[551.18 --> 553.10]  I hope that my preaching and teaching,
[553.22 --> 554.20]  that Pastor Kevin's,
[554.28 --> 555.10]  that Josh,
[555.18 --> 556.46]  as he was up here last week,
[556.48 --> 558.58]  whoever stands here, right,
[558.62 --> 559.62]  and brings the Word to you,
[559.64 --> 560.08]  or Nikki,
[560.24 --> 560.70]  or Mike,
[560.80 --> 561.26]  or Eric,
[561.38 --> 563.26]  or Hank the Hound in Kids Corner,
[563.64 --> 565.28]  that the kids worship volunteers,
[565.48 --> 566.58]  that Bible study leaders,
[566.94 --> 568.40]  whomever it may be,
[568.62 --> 572.24]  our job is to inspire faithfulness
[572.24 --> 573.32]  in each other.
[575.46 --> 577.36]  I think that's a really interesting question
[577.36 --> 579.24]  for us to consider.
[579.24 --> 581.80]  Let me put it in a way
[581.80 --> 582.58]  that I think James
[582.58 --> 584.96]  wants us to apply this verse.
[587.10 --> 588.06]  Are your words,
[588.60 --> 589.24]  is your speech,
[590.36 --> 592.94]  inspiring faithfulness to Jesus
[592.94 --> 595.12]  in the people who hear you?
[597.20 --> 597.82]  So mom,
[598.70 --> 599.78]  do your words
[599.78 --> 602.32]  draw faithfulness to Jesus
[602.32 --> 603.30]  out of your daughter?
[604.68 --> 606.28]  Maybe you're an aspiring
[606.28 --> 607.24]  social media influencer.
[607.24 --> 609.26]  Do your words
[609.26 --> 611.10]  inspire faithfulness to God
[611.10 --> 612.00]  in your followers,
[612.12 --> 613.22]  whether that's five
[613.22 --> 614.08]  or five million?
[615.66 --> 616.42]  I think about it.
[616.72 --> 617.94]  We may not all be teachers
[617.94 --> 618.82]  in the church,
[619.28 --> 620.10]  but all of us
[620.10 --> 622.08]  have a sphere of influence
[622.08 --> 623.76]  over which we speak words.
[624.38 --> 626.56]  And is your sphere of influence
[626.56 --> 628.68]  inspired to faithfulness
[628.68 --> 630.64]  by the way you talk to them,
[630.80 --> 632.58]  by the very words you use?
[632.58 --> 634.94]  I really believe
[634.94 --> 636.14]  that that's a good measure
[636.14 --> 638.56]  with which to check ourselves
[638.56 --> 641.60]  in this conversation.
[645.44 --> 647.56]  But there's another way
[647.56 --> 650.78]  in which this is also applicable,
[651.10 --> 653.50]  and a way that I was really struck by,
[653.58 --> 655.20]  and it's a more immediate way
[655.20 --> 656.58]  and perhaps probably actually
[656.58 --> 658.10]  a negative way, right,
[658.14 --> 659.94]  in which this verse is also true.
[659.94 --> 661.54]  Because in our world,
[661.64 --> 663.44]  especially in this digital age
[663.44 --> 664.62]  where most of what we do
[664.62 --> 666.08]  is online forever,
[666.48 --> 666.68]  right,
[666.70 --> 668.20]  when you put yourself out there,
[668.26 --> 669.54]  your ideas or your teaching
[669.54 --> 670.26]  or whatever,
[670.48 --> 672.08]  you are inviting judgment
[672.08 --> 673.16]  from people.
[674.34 --> 675.46]  So YouTube content,
[675.74 --> 676.34]  TikToks,
[676.42 --> 676.74]  Instagram,
[677.00 --> 677.28]  Facebook,
[677.46 --> 678.04]  whatever it is,
[678.10 --> 679.50]  when you put yourself out there,
[679.82 --> 681.46]  people will judge it.
[683.02 --> 684.30]  And so many people
[684.30 --> 684.96]  on the internet
[684.96 --> 685.64]  have forgotten
[685.64 --> 687.30]  how to separate ideas
[687.30 --> 688.02]  from the people
[688.02 --> 688.62]  who speak them.
[689.96 --> 690.90]  And instead of debating
[690.90 --> 692.36]  ideas and content,
[692.58 --> 693.76]  we attack the messenger.
[694.94 --> 695.14]  Right?
[695.18 --> 695.94]  You get trolled
[695.94 --> 696.68]  or you get bullied
[696.68 --> 697.64]  or you get canceled.
[698.50 --> 699.24]  And it's not just
[699.24 --> 699.86]  the so-called
[699.86 --> 701.40]  keyboard warriors anymore.
[701.66 --> 702.52]  This is normal.
[702.90 --> 704.52]  This is how we interact online.
[705.20 --> 706.28]  And it hurts.
[707.92 --> 708.92]  And it's hard.
[708.92 --> 711.82]  So look,
[711.90 --> 712.96]  we've put it in this
[712.96 --> 714.30]  context before,
[715.20 --> 716.18]  but Christians
[716.18 --> 717.80]  have to be
[717.80 --> 718.72]  different.
[720.00 --> 720.76]  If you say
[720.76 --> 721.68]  that you believe
[721.68 --> 723.08]  in this Jesus guy
[723.08 --> 724.10]  and you really want
[724.10 --> 724.88]  to live your life
[724.88 --> 725.48]  for the glory
[725.48 --> 726.68]  of his name,
[726.80 --> 728.16]  you've got to be different.
[728.94 --> 729.94]  And so stop it.
[730.78 --> 730.88]  Right?
[731.00 --> 731.84]  Be different.
[732.32 --> 733.44]  Post different.
[733.78 --> 734.92]  Engage differently.
[735.30 --> 736.46]  Talk differently.
[736.46 --> 738.00]  In fact,
[738.24 --> 740.02]  if you see something online
[740.02 --> 741.36]  that triggers you,
[742.08 --> 742.96]  maybe try talking
[742.96 --> 743.56]  to that person
[743.56 --> 744.46]  face-to-face.
[745.28 --> 745.40]  Right?
[745.44 --> 746.20]  Take it offline.
[746.72 --> 747.50]  Maybe what we need
[747.50 --> 748.06]  to reclaim
[748.06 --> 749.50]  is face-to-face
[749.50 --> 750.82]  and dinner table debates.
[751.58 --> 751.72]  Right?
[751.78 --> 752.50]  Enough of this
[752.50 --> 754.16]  avatar echo chamber.
[755.00 --> 755.12]  Right?
[755.16 --> 756.00]  Just stop it.
[756.46 --> 757.20]  Be different.
[759.12 --> 759.84]  And I think
[759.84 --> 760.62]  what James is saying
[760.62 --> 761.18]  is that's got to
[761.18 --> 761.82]  start up here.
[762.54 --> 763.24]  It's got to start
[763.24 --> 765.42]  with our words,
[765.42 --> 766.70]  with our speech.
[767.64 --> 768.20]  And I think James
[768.20 --> 769.32]  makes this clear
[769.32 --> 769.98]  when he says
[769.98 --> 771.42]  in verse 2.
[772.54 --> 772.88]  He says,
[773.02 --> 773.70]  we all stumble
[773.70 --> 775.02]  in many ways.
[776.20 --> 776.90]  Anyone who is
[776.90 --> 777.76]  never at fault
[777.76 --> 779.14]  in what they say
[779.14 --> 780.04]  is perfect,
[780.34 --> 781.08]  able to keep
[781.08 --> 781.94]  their whole body
[781.94 --> 782.48]  in check.
[783.04 --> 783.50]  And so first,
[783.58 --> 784.34]  what I want us
[784.34 --> 785.28]  to see in that verse
[785.28 --> 786.68]  is that James
[786.68 --> 787.72]  is a realist.
[788.80 --> 788.98]  Right?
[789.00 --> 789.70]  What does he start there?
[789.74 --> 789.94]  He says,
[790.00 --> 790.80]  we all stumble
[790.80 --> 791.92]  in many ways.
[792.30 --> 793.40]  You are not perfect
[793.40 --> 793.92]  in this.
[793.92 --> 795.16]  I am not perfect
[795.16 --> 795.44]  in this.
[795.54 --> 796.30]  No one is.
[797.14 --> 797.24]  Right?
[797.30 --> 797.98]  And this isn't
[797.98 --> 799.26]  about shame.
[799.46 --> 800.22]  This isn't about
[800.22 --> 800.98]  shaming you
[800.98 --> 802.02]  into behavior
[802.02 --> 803.06]  modification.
[803.46 --> 803.58]  Right?
[803.62 --> 803.86]  Again,
[803.94 --> 804.72]  in our culture,
[804.92 --> 805.84]  we've come to this
[805.84 --> 806.68]  place where we think
[806.68 --> 807.74]  that public shaming
[807.74 --> 808.64]  is the only
[808.64 --> 809.70]  effective tool
[809.70 --> 810.20]  for changing
[810.20 --> 810.88]  people's lives.
[811.36 --> 812.66]  But let's be honest,
[813.02 --> 814.04]  it's not genuinely
[814.04 --> 814.74]  effective.
[815.86 --> 815.96]  Right?
[816.06 --> 816.76]  Shame makes
[816.76 --> 817.60]  people hide.
[818.04 --> 818.92]  Shame makes us
[818.92 --> 819.62]  bury things
[819.62 --> 820.56]  so deeply
[820.56 --> 821.04]  that people
[821.04 --> 821.80]  don't see them.
[822.14 --> 822.78]  Shame doesn't
[822.78 --> 823.72]  change us.
[824.04 --> 824.56]  Shame doesn't
[824.56 --> 825.20]  stop you
[825.20 --> 826.02]  from stumbling.
[826.38 --> 827.00]  It just means
[827.00 --> 827.70]  that you stumble
[827.70 --> 828.98]  alone in the dark.
[830.50 --> 831.06]  Christians
[831.06 --> 831.82]  gotta be
[831.82 --> 832.62]  different.
[834.20 --> 834.86]  So the question
[834.86 --> 835.70]  for you is,
[836.00 --> 836.46]  will you be
[836.46 --> 837.58]  mastered by shame
[837.58 --> 838.28]  and sin
[838.28 --> 839.82]  or will you
[839.82 --> 840.48]  learn to
[840.48 --> 841.38]  master it
[841.38 --> 842.16]  in the power
[842.16 --> 842.84]  of the gospel?
[844.20 --> 845.56]  You can change.
[845.90 --> 847.32]  Jesus changes you.
[847.40 --> 848.08]  The Holy Spirit
[848.08 --> 849.22]  enables you.
[850.08 --> 850.26]  Look,
[850.88 --> 851.26]  Josh,
[851.52 --> 852.32]  last week for us,
[852.32 --> 853.08]  made this point
[853.08 --> 853.78]  so well.
[854.52 --> 854.64]  Right?
[854.66 --> 855.12]  If your Bibles
[855.12 --> 855.54]  are open,
[855.62 --> 856.74]  look at verse 26
[856.74 --> 857.90]  at the end
[857.90 --> 858.56]  of chapter 2.
[859.46 --> 860.40]  Verse 26 says,
[860.76 --> 861.36]  as the body
[861.36 --> 862.04]  without the spirit
[862.04 --> 862.48]  is dead,
[862.66 --> 863.38]  so faith
[863.38 --> 864.46]  without deeds
[864.46 --> 865.84]  is dead.
[866.16 --> 867.20]  You are
[867.20 --> 867.82]  no longer
[867.82 --> 868.24]  dead.
[868.92 --> 869.82]  That's the gospel
[869.82 --> 870.78]  for us.
[871.22 --> 871.38]  Right?
[871.48 --> 872.06]  That Jesus
[872.06 --> 872.96]  lived the life
[872.96 --> 873.82]  I should have lived
[873.82 --> 874.78]  and died the death
[874.78 --> 875.42]  that I deserve
[875.42 --> 876.38]  and that three days
[876.38 --> 877.24]  later he was
[877.24 --> 878.88]  raised from the dead.
[879.16 --> 879.80]  The grave
[879.80 --> 880.84]  is empty.
[880.84 --> 881.92]  He walked out
[881.92 --> 882.16]  of it
[882.16 --> 882.64]  and now
[882.64 --> 883.36]  that grave
[883.36 --> 883.88]  of sin
[883.88 --> 884.32]  and death
[884.32 --> 885.80]  has no hold
[885.80 --> 886.46]  over you.
[886.56 --> 887.30]  It can't hold
[887.30 --> 887.84]  you down.
[888.22 --> 888.64]  In him
[888.64 --> 889.82]  you are raised
[889.82 --> 890.40]  from being
[890.40 --> 891.88]  spiritually dead
[891.88 --> 893.22]  to being
[893.22 --> 894.58]  finally alive.
[895.60 --> 896.26]  The glory
[896.26 --> 896.84]  of God
[896.84 --> 897.58]  is the human
[897.58 --> 898.56]  being fully
[898.56 --> 899.34]  alive.
[899.70 --> 900.46]  Real faith
[900.46 --> 902.12]  means real life.
[903.12 --> 904.00]  Maybe for the
[904.00 --> 904.72]  first time.
[906.18 --> 907.38]  Actual life.
[907.38 --> 909.18]  Jesus life
[909.18 --> 910.42]  lived in you
[910.42 --> 911.64]  and through you
[911.64 --> 912.34]  as you are
[912.34 --> 912.92]  transformed
[912.92 --> 914.08]  from one degree
[914.08 --> 914.86]  of glory
[914.86 --> 915.94]  to another.
[916.82 --> 916.94]  Right?
[917.06 --> 917.84]  Real faith.
[917.98 --> 918.90]  Hearer and doer
[918.90 --> 919.30]  faith
[919.30 --> 920.36]  means that you
[920.36 --> 921.50]  are being transformed
[921.50 --> 922.68]  into the image
[922.68 --> 923.56]  of his son.
[924.48 --> 924.96]  And so,
[925.44 --> 925.76]  yes,
[925.96 --> 927.14]  we all stumble
[927.14 --> 928.72]  in many ways
[928.72 --> 929.40]  but you are not
[929.40 --> 930.84]  defined by stumbling.
[931.64 --> 932.64]  You are defined
[932.64 --> 933.80]  by getting up,
[934.02 --> 935.18]  by being raised up
[935.18 --> 935.78]  and walking
[935.78 --> 936.56]  in the truth.
[936.56 --> 937.56]  You are defined
[937.56 --> 938.30]  by Jesus
[938.30 --> 939.54]  who looks at you
[939.54 --> 940.18]  and says,
[940.58 --> 942.28]  you are mine.
[945.32 --> 946.40]  And with that
[946.40 --> 948.34]  new creation
[948.34 --> 949.68]  reality in front
[949.68 --> 950.02]  of us,
[950.10 --> 951.08]  James makes
[951.08 --> 951.88]  a connection
[951.88 --> 952.80]  between what
[952.80 --> 953.68]  you say
[953.68 --> 955.04]  and keeping
[955.04 --> 956.06]  your whole body
[956.06 --> 956.74]  in check.
[957.86 --> 957.98]  Right?
[958.06 --> 958.70]  Anyone who
[958.70 --> 960.20]  is never at fault
[960.20 --> 961.04]  in what they
[961.04 --> 962.70]  say is perfect,
[962.88 --> 963.58]  able to keep
[963.58 --> 964.52]  their whole body
[964.52 --> 965.38]  in check.
[965.38 --> 965.76]  And look,
[966.38 --> 966.70]  again,
[966.84 --> 967.80]  this isn't about
[967.80 --> 968.42]  you needing
[968.42 --> 969.34]  to be perfect.
[969.56 --> 969.62]  Right?
[969.68 --> 970.28]  James has already
[970.28 --> 970.96]  made the point
[970.96 --> 971.88]  by saying that
[971.88 --> 972.64]  we all stumble
[972.64 --> 973.68]  in many ways.
[973.78 --> 974.08]  Instead,
[974.22 --> 974.94]  James' point
[974.94 --> 976.30]  is that keeping
[976.30 --> 977.04]  in check
[977.04 --> 978.16]  what you say
[978.16 --> 979.32]  is the barometer
[979.32 --> 980.30]  for the rest
[980.30 --> 980.96]  of your life.
[981.76 --> 981.90]  Right?
[981.90 --> 982.38]  If you have
[982.38 --> 982.98]  the spiritual
[982.98 --> 983.50]  discipline
[983.50 --> 984.16]  to check
[984.16 --> 984.80]  your tongue,
[985.00 --> 985.48]  you have
[985.48 --> 986.16]  the spiritual
[986.16 --> 986.76]  discipline
[986.76 --> 987.76]  to rule
[987.76 --> 988.30]  the rest
[988.30 --> 989.00]  of your life
[989.00 --> 989.88]  and body.
[991.80 --> 992.50]  Look,
[992.56 --> 992.96]  it's a
[992.96 --> 995.22]  real simple
[995.22 --> 996.34]  example.
[997.52 --> 998.58]  But say
[998.58 --> 999.34]  you have
[999.34 --> 1000.12]  an area
[1000.12 --> 1001.00]  of your life
[1001.00 --> 1001.52]  that you are
[1001.52 --> 1002.44]  really struggling
[1002.44 --> 1003.54]  to bring
[1003.54 --> 1004.48]  into submission
[1004.48 --> 1005.06]  to Jesus.
[1006.06 --> 1006.56]  Maybe it's
[1006.56 --> 1006.94]  an area
[1006.94 --> 1008.02]  of sexuality
[1008.02 --> 1008.74]  or sexual
[1008.74 --> 1009.24]  activity,
[1009.64 --> 1010.08]  maybe it's
[1010.08 --> 1010.54]  substances,
[1010.80 --> 1011.24]  maybe it's
[1011.24 --> 1011.76]  gossip.
[1012.48 --> 1012.60]  Right?
[1012.66 --> 1013.36]  Whatever it is
[1013.36 --> 1013.84]  for you,
[1013.94 --> 1014.52]  it doesn't matter.
[1014.62 --> 1014.72]  Well,
[1015.64 --> 1016.68]  it does matter,
[1016.68 --> 1017.26]  of course it
[1017.26 --> 1017.62]  matters,
[1017.82 --> 1018.34]  but for the
[1018.34 --> 1018.82]  purposes of
[1018.82 --> 1019.24]  this example,
[1019.32 --> 1019.64]  it doesn't
[1019.64 --> 1019.98]  matter.
[1020.34 --> 1021.34]  Whatever it is,
[1021.72 --> 1022.26]  what is the
[1022.26 --> 1023.36]  first thing
[1023.36 --> 1024.42]  that we always
[1024.42 --> 1025.34]  do with our
[1025.34 --> 1025.60]  sin?
[1027.60 --> 1028.52]  We justify
[1028.52 --> 1029.00]  it to
[1029.00 --> 1029.50]  ourselves.
[1030.76 --> 1031.72]  We convince
[1031.72 --> 1032.42]  ourselves
[1032.42 --> 1033.54]  with words,
[1033.94 --> 1034.12]  right,
[1034.24 --> 1035.20]  spoken or
[1035.20 --> 1035.90]  whispered in
[1035.90 --> 1036.36]  our minds,
[1036.62 --> 1037.26]  we convince
[1037.26 --> 1038.16]  ourselves that
[1038.16 --> 1038.60]  there's no
[1038.60 --> 1039.22]  other option,
[1039.48 --> 1039.76]  that there's
[1039.76 --> 1040.50]  no better way
[1040.50 --> 1040.88]  or there's
[1040.88 --> 1041.46]  no way to
[1041.46 --> 1042.00]  stop it,
[1042.04 --> 1042.30]  and so I
[1042.30 --> 1042.68]  just really
[1042.68 --> 1043.12]  have to be
[1043.12 --> 1043.56]  careful,
[1043.86 --> 1043.96]  right,
[1043.96 --> 1044.22]  I have to
[1044.22 --> 1045.02]  manage it
[1045.02 --> 1045.54]  just so it
[1045.54 --> 1046.10]  doesn't rule
[1046.10 --> 1046.30]  me,
[1046.30 --> 1046.66]  but I can
[1046.66 --> 1046.92]  still,
[1046.98 --> 1047.34]  you know,
[1047.58 --> 1048.30]  engage every
[1048.30 --> 1048.60]  once in a
[1048.60 --> 1048.66]  while.
[1048.74 --> 1049.14]  We tell
[1049.14 --> 1049.74]  ourselves that
[1049.74 --> 1050.16]  it's less
[1050.16 --> 1050.68]  of a deal
[1050.68 --> 1051.24]  than we
[1051.24 --> 1051.60]  know it
[1051.60 --> 1052.24]  truly is,
[1052.36 --> 1052.92]  and so we
[1052.92 --> 1053.42]  keep on
[1053.42 --> 1053.94]  going in
[1053.94 --> 1054.42]  our sin,
[1054.60 --> 1054.96]  we keep
[1054.96 --> 1055.38]  on going
[1055.38 --> 1055.72]  in our
[1055.72 --> 1056.16]  stumbling,
[1057.06 --> 1057.76]  and maybe
[1057.76 --> 1058.78]  the first
[1058.78 --> 1059.36]  step to
[1059.36 --> 1060.00]  overcoming
[1060.00 --> 1060.98]  is to start
[1060.98 --> 1061.78]  telling yourself
[1061.78 --> 1062.26]  a different
[1062.26 --> 1062.98]  story,
[1063.80 --> 1064.02]  right,
[1064.10 --> 1064.58]  preach a
[1064.58 --> 1065.06]  true and
[1065.06 --> 1066.10]  better gospel
[1066.10 --> 1066.78]  to ourselves,
[1067.00 --> 1067.86]  stop preaching
[1067.86 --> 1068.84]  shame and
[1068.84 --> 1069.22]  guilt,
[1069.58 --> 1070.20]  start preaching
[1070.20 --> 1070.84]  hope and
[1070.84 --> 1071.44]  new life.
[1072.52 --> 1072.94]  I really
[1072.94 --> 1073.54]  believe that
[1073.54 --> 1074.20]  part of why
[1074.20 --> 1074.94]  we stay
[1074.94 --> 1075.98]  stuck,
[1075.98 --> 1076.98]  is because
[1076.98 --> 1077.30]  of the
[1077.30 --> 1077.78]  words we
[1077.78 --> 1078.72]  tell ourselves
[1078.72 --> 1079.36]  and because
[1079.36 --> 1079.64]  of the
[1079.64 --> 1080.10]  words that
[1080.10 --> 1080.60]  are spoken
[1080.60 --> 1081.32]  to us
[1081.32 --> 1082.14]  or about
[1082.14 --> 1082.52]  us.
[1083.96 --> 1084.80]  But James
[1084.80 --> 1085.50]  is saying
[1085.50 --> 1086.42]  that the
[1086.42 --> 1087.32]  tongue has
[1087.32 --> 1087.90]  the power
[1087.90 --> 1088.62]  to control
[1088.62 --> 1089.22]  the rest
[1089.22 --> 1090.24]  of the body
[1090.24 --> 1090.94]  and it
[1090.94 --> 1092.12]  starts with
[1092.12 --> 1092.56]  what you
[1092.56 --> 1093.64]  tell yourself
[1093.64 --> 1094.96]  and what you
[1094.96 --> 1095.48]  are telling
[1095.48 --> 1096.38]  others about
[1096.38 --> 1096.96]  themselves.
[1097.96 --> 1099.02]  Remember where
[1099.02 --> 1100.12]  we started
[1100.12 --> 1100.52]  this,
[1100.58 --> 1100.70]  right,
[1100.70 --> 1101.56]  do your
[1101.56 --> 1102.72]  words inspire
[1102.72 --> 1103.86]  faithfulness
[1103.86 --> 1104.60]  in your
[1104.60 --> 1105.12]  hearers?
[1106.12 --> 1106.62]  Does what
[1106.62 --> 1107.44]  you say
[1107.44 --> 1108.58]  to yourself
[1108.58 --> 1110.02]  about yourself
[1110.02 --> 1110.62]  inspire
[1110.62 --> 1111.64]  faithfulness
[1111.64 --> 1112.50]  in you?
[1113.70 --> 1114.28]  And so in
[1114.28 --> 1114.78]  this text,
[1114.94 --> 1116.06]  James uses
[1116.06 --> 1117.50]  three examples
[1117.50 --> 1118.24]  to underscore
[1118.24 --> 1119.30]  this important
[1119.30 --> 1119.80]  point,
[1120.20 --> 1120.38]  right?
[1120.48 --> 1121.34]  He pictures
[1121.34 --> 1122.16]  for you a
[1122.16 --> 1123.02]  huge horse
[1123.02 --> 1124.08]  that is running
[1124.08 --> 1125.10]  at a full
[1125.10 --> 1125.82]  gallop and it
[1125.82 --> 1126.70]  can be steered
[1126.70 --> 1127.46]  by a tiny
[1127.46 --> 1128.64]  little bit
[1128.64 --> 1130.08]  or a giant
[1130.08 --> 1131.10]  ship that
[1131.10 --> 1131.86]  can be turned
[1131.86 --> 1132.52]  by a very
[1132.52 --> 1133.78]  small rudder
[1133.78 --> 1135.16]  or a spark
[1135.16 --> 1135.82]  that lights
[1135.82 --> 1136.40]  the whole
[1136.40 --> 1138.12]  forest ablaze.
[1138.24 --> 1138.80]  That's the
[1138.80 --> 1140.00]  power of
[1140.00 --> 1140.54]  the tongue,
[1140.82 --> 1140.94]  right?
[1140.98 --> 1141.76]  It can steer
[1141.76 --> 1142.32]  your life
[1142.32 --> 1142.64]  and your
[1142.64 --> 1143.16]  interactions
[1143.16 --> 1143.98]  and can set
[1143.98 --> 1144.54]  your course
[1144.54 --> 1145.16]  and it can
[1145.16 --> 1145.92]  burn all
[1145.92 --> 1146.70]  your relationships
[1146.70 --> 1147.44]  to the ground.
[1149.42 --> 1149.96]  James goes
[1149.96 --> 1150.60]  even further
[1150.60 --> 1151.84]  and I think
[1151.84 --> 1152.48]  this is easy
[1152.48 --> 1153.48]  for many of us
[1153.48 --> 1153.90]  to miss
[1153.90 --> 1154.36]  when we read
[1154.36 --> 1154.88]  this text
[1154.88 --> 1155.46]  and I say
[1155.46 --> 1155.80]  that because
[1155.80 --> 1156.26]  it was easy
[1156.26 --> 1156.74]  for me to
[1156.74 --> 1157.08]  miss the
[1157.08 --> 1157.44]  first few
[1157.44 --> 1157.80]  times I
[1157.80 --> 1158.24]  read it.
[1160.74 --> 1161.44]  James says
[1161.44 --> 1162.18]  in verse 6,
[1163.18 --> 1163.58]  the tongue
[1163.58 --> 1164.24]  corrupts
[1164.24 --> 1164.58]  the whole
[1164.58 --> 1164.98]  body,
[1165.50 --> 1165.92]  sets the
[1165.92 --> 1166.54]  whole course
[1166.54 --> 1167.02]  of one's
[1167.02 --> 1168.42]  life on
[1168.42 --> 1169.04]  fire and
[1169.04 --> 1170.00]  is itself
[1170.00 --> 1171.10]  set on
[1171.10 --> 1172.36]  fire by
[1172.36 --> 1173.58]  hell.
[1174.86 --> 1175.02]  Right?
[1175.06 --> 1175.30]  Look at
[1175.30 --> 1175.88]  verse 9,
[1176.14 --> 1176.34]  right?
[1176.46 --> 1177.00]  And tie
[1177.00 --> 1177.36]  these two
[1177.36 --> 1177.72]  together.
[1177.86 --> 1178.18]  With the
[1178.18 --> 1178.64]  tongue we
[1178.64 --> 1179.18]  praise our
[1179.18 --> 1179.72]  Lord and
[1179.72 --> 1180.30]  Father and
[1180.30 --> 1180.88]  with it we
[1180.88 --> 1181.54]  curse human
[1181.54 --> 1181.98]  beings.
[1182.32 --> 1182.76]  Out of the
[1182.76 --> 1183.32]  same mouth
[1183.32 --> 1184.28]  comes praise
[1184.28 --> 1185.84]  or cursing.
[1186.18 --> 1187.06]  Your words
[1187.06 --> 1188.56]  literally speak
[1188.56 --> 1189.84]  hell or
[1189.84 --> 1190.42]  they speak
[1190.42 --> 1190.78]  heaven.
[1191.98 --> 1193.02]  Your words
[1193.02 --> 1193.92]  speak praises
[1193.92 --> 1195.20]  or curses.
[1195.42 --> 1196.00]  They're not
[1196.00 --> 1196.48]  neutral.
[1197.10 --> 1197.22]  Right?
[1197.28 --> 1197.86]  Your tongue
[1197.86 --> 1199.12]  isn't neutral.
[1199.48 --> 1200.06]  With it you
[1200.06 --> 1201.00]  speak life
[1201.00 --> 1202.36]  or you speak
[1202.36 --> 1203.00]  death.
[1204.74 --> 1205.74]  Listen to how
[1205.74 --> 1206.48]  Proverbs
[1206.48 --> 1207.22]  puts it.
[1208.28 --> 1208.98]  Proverbs 18
[1208.98 --> 1209.54]  verse 21
[1209.54 --> 1209.92]  says,
[1209.92 --> 1210.88]  the tongue
[1210.88 --> 1211.40]  has the
[1211.40 --> 1212.08]  power of
[1212.08 --> 1212.76]  life and
[1212.76 --> 1213.50]  death and
[1213.50 --> 1214.10]  those who
[1214.10 --> 1214.64]  love it
[1214.64 --> 1215.34]  eat its
[1215.34 --> 1215.94]  fruit.
[1216.04 --> 1216.54]  Or Jesus
[1216.54 --> 1217.14]  gives the
[1217.14 --> 1217.56]  same sort
[1217.56 --> 1218.00]  of idea
[1218.00 --> 1218.34]  when he
[1218.34 --> 1219.26]  says in
[1219.26 --> 1219.78]  Luke 6,
[1219.90 --> 1220.44]  the mouth
[1220.44 --> 1221.36]  speaks what
[1221.36 --> 1221.88]  the heart
[1221.88 --> 1223.34]  is full
[1223.34 --> 1223.68]  of.
[1223.92 --> 1224.18]  And so
[1224.18 --> 1224.70]  is your
[1224.70 --> 1225.46]  heart full
[1225.46 --> 1226.04]  of heaven
[1226.04 --> 1226.72]  or is your
[1226.72 --> 1227.38]  heart full
[1227.38 --> 1227.96]  of hell?
[1228.22 --> 1228.90]  Your words
[1228.90 --> 1229.34]  will tell
[1229.34 --> 1229.62]  me.
[1230.84 --> 1231.56]  Will you
[1231.56 --> 1232.36]  speak life
[1232.36 --> 1233.46]  or will
[1233.46 --> 1233.94]  you speak
[1233.94 --> 1234.32]  death?
[1236.98 --> 1237.78]  In my
[1237.78 --> 1239.62]  house we
[1239.62 --> 1240.02]  have taken
[1240.02 --> 1241.20]  this proverb
[1241.20 --> 1241.92]  to heart
[1241.92 --> 1242.34]  and we've
[1242.34 --> 1242.68]  turned it
[1242.68 --> 1243.28]  into a
[1243.28 --> 1244.08]  thing for
[1244.08 --> 1244.62]  our kids
[1244.62 --> 1245.30]  and for
[1245.30 --> 1245.62]  how we
[1245.62 --> 1246.04]  talk to
[1246.04 --> 1246.42]  each other.
[1246.72 --> 1247.06]  And my
[1247.06 --> 1247.78]  kids probably
[1247.78 --> 1248.30]  get sick
[1248.30 --> 1248.90]  of it for
[1248.90 --> 1249.04]  me.
[1249.08 --> 1249.40]  In fact I
[1249.40 --> 1249.80]  know they
[1249.80 --> 1250.22]  do because
[1250.22 --> 1250.88]  every time
[1250.88 --> 1251.78]  my eight-year-old
[1251.78 --> 1252.32]  daughter rolls
[1252.32 --> 1252.88]  her eyes
[1252.88 --> 1254.02]  when I say
[1254.02 --> 1254.22]  it.
[1255.68 --> 1256.06]  But when
[1256.06 --> 1256.72]  someone says
[1256.72 --> 1257.48]  something mean
[1257.48 --> 1258.34]  or hurtful,
[1258.72 --> 1259.26]  when someone
[1259.26 --> 1260.40]  needlessly yells
[1260.40 --> 1261.50]  or says an
[1261.50 --> 1261.92]  inappropriate
[1261.92 --> 1262.56]  word, you
[1262.56 --> 1262.98]  will hear
[1262.98 --> 1263.68]  either me
[1263.68 --> 1264.30]  or Rachel,
[1264.42 --> 1264.88]  my wife,
[1265.08 --> 1266.30]  say words
[1266.30 --> 1266.82]  of
[1266.82 --> 1266.88]  life,
[1267.48 --> 1268.22]  my kids
[1268.22 --> 1268.64]  are probably
[1268.64 --> 1269.28]  finishing that
[1269.28 --> 1269.80]  sentence right
[1269.80 --> 1270.58]  now and I'll
[1270.58 --> 1270.96]  wait for them
[1270.96 --> 1271.44]  to say it,
[1271.62 --> 1272.14]  they say
[1272.14 --> 1273.16]  life,
[1273.88 --> 1274.66]  words of
[1274.66 --> 1275.54]  life.
[1275.86 --> 1276.28]  And I will
[1276.28 --> 1276.64]  ask,
[1277.02 --> 1277.66]  is what you
[1277.66 --> 1278.62]  said bringing
[1278.62 --> 1279.92]  life or is
[1279.92 --> 1280.32]  it bringing
[1280.32 --> 1282.14]  death to
[1282.14 --> 1282.50]  your brother
[1282.50 --> 1283.00]  or sister?
[1284.04 --> 1284.66]  Because we
[1284.66 --> 1285.68]  want life and
[1285.68 --> 1286.04]  we want to
[1286.04 --> 1287.12]  speak words
[1287.12 --> 1287.82]  of life and
[1287.82 --> 1288.20]  we need to
[1288.20 --> 1288.90]  be reminded
[1288.90 --> 1289.62]  that our
[1289.62 --> 1290.14]  tongue has
[1290.14 --> 1290.86]  the power of
[1290.86 --> 1291.38]  life and
[1291.38 --> 1291.80]  death, of
[1291.80 --> 1292.90]  heaven and
[1292.90 --> 1293.56]  hell in it.
[1294.42 --> 1295.14]  And we need
[1295.14 --> 1295.88]  to be encouraged
[1295.88 --> 1296.82]  to speak
[1296.82 --> 1297.74]  life.
[1298.88 --> 1299.60]  Sticks and
[1299.60 --> 1300.20]  stones may
[1300.20 --> 1300.70]  break my
[1300.70 --> 1301.20]  bones but
[1301.20 --> 1301.76]  words will
[1301.76 --> 1302.24]  never hurt
[1302.24 --> 1303.44]  me is just
[1303.44 --> 1304.28]  patently
[1304.28 --> 1305.04]  wrong.
[1306.84 --> 1307.40]  Words
[1307.40 --> 1308.88]  speak life
[1308.88 --> 1310.32]  or they
[1310.32 --> 1310.92]  speak death.
[1312.00 --> 1312.82]  Tongue has
[1312.82 --> 1313.62]  the power of
[1313.62 --> 1314.78]  heaven and
[1314.78 --> 1316.06]  hell in it.
[1316.54 --> 1316.96]  What will
[1316.96 --> 1317.40]  it be?
[1319.06 --> 1320.04]  The next time
[1320.04 --> 1320.76]  you are about
[1320.76 --> 1321.46]  to post on
[1321.46 --> 1322.32]  Facebook or
[1322.32 --> 1323.06]  to comment on
[1323.06 --> 1323.70]  a video or
[1323.70 --> 1324.42]  to react to
[1324.42 --> 1325.32]  some TikTok,
[1325.78 --> 1326.52]  the next time
[1326.52 --> 1327.30]  you are
[1327.30 --> 1327.96]  tempted to
[1327.96 --> 1328.90]  tell someone
[1328.90 --> 1330.12]  else's story,
[1330.82 --> 1331.48]  let's be clear,
[1331.54 --> 1332.06]  that's gossip
[1332.06 --> 1333.06]  folks, when
[1333.06 --> 1333.46]  you're tempted
[1333.46 --> 1334.16]  to tell someone
[1334.16 --> 1334.78]  else's story,
[1334.86 --> 1335.28]  the next time
[1335.28 --> 1336.08]  you are teaching
[1336.08 --> 1336.94]  your kids or
[1336.94 --> 1338.06]  talking to your
[1338.06 --> 1338.96]  boss, ask
[1338.96 --> 1340.14]  yourself, is
[1340.14 --> 1341.00]  what I am
[1341.00 --> 1342.18]  about to say
[1342.18 --> 1343.98]  inspiring faithfulness
[1343.98 --> 1345.48]  to Jesus in me
[1345.48 --> 1346.22]  and in my
[1346.22 --> 1346.66]  hearers?
[1346.66 --> 1349.08]  the way you
[1349.08 --> 1350.16]  talk to
[1350.16 --> 1350.76]  others and
[1350.76 --> 1351.52]  yes to
[1351.52 --> 1353.02]  yourself is
[1353.02 --> 1353.68]  the barometer
[1353.68 --> 1354.76]  of your
[1354.76 --> 1355.06]  faith.
[1356.42 --> 1357.16]  Look, this is
[1357.16 --> 1357.68]  where I'll end
[1357.68 --> 1359.12]  and I'll use
[1359.12 --> 1359.98]  the language of
[1359.98 --> 1360.56]  verse 11 and
[1360.56 --> 1360.80]  12.
[1363.26 --> 1363.96]  When your
[1363.96 --> 1364.88]  faith is real
[1364.88 --> 1365.92]  and really
[1365.92 --> 1366.82]  real, when
[1366.82 --> 1367.42]  your faith is
[1367.42 --> 1368.36]  real, it means
[1368.36 --> 1368.90]  that you have
[1368.90 --> 1369.66]  drunk deeply
[1369.66 --> 1370.64]  of the living
[1370.64 --> 1371.74]  water that is
[1371.74 --> 1372.74]  Jesus Christ
[1372.74 --> 1374.96]  and so stop
[1374.96 --> 1376.22]  being salty in
[1376.22 --> 1376.86]  your speech.
[1378.04 --> 1379.12]  Instead, imagine
[1379.12 --> 1379.90]  what it would
[1379.90 --> 1380.60]  look like for
[1380.60 --> 1381.70]  every person to
[1381.70 --> 1382.28]  leave a
[1382.28 --> 1383.24]  conversation with
[1383.24 --> 1384.34]  you, regardless
[1384.34 --> 1385.00]  of what its
[1385.00 --> 1385.86]  content might
[1385.86 --> 1386.38]  have been,
[1386.78 --> 1387.84]  feeling refreshed
[1387.84 --> 1389.08]  and renewed
[1389.08 --> 1390.64]  like a cold
[1390.64 --> 1391.46]  glass of water
[1391.46 --> 1392.24]  on a hot
[1392.24 --> 1392.80]  summer's day.
[1393.86 --> 1394.86]  We can disagree,
[1395.38 --> 1396.00]  we can have
[1396.00 --> 1396.98]  hard conversations,
[1397.26 --> 1397.94]  we can even
[1397.94 --> 1398.72]  get angry, we
[1398.72 --> 1399.40]  can be frustrated,
[1399.72 --> 1400.34]  we can lament
[1400.34 --> 1401.26]  and we can cry
[1401.26 --> 1402.10]  out, but the
[1402.10 --> 1403.14]  way that we
[1403.14 --> 1404.16]  do that, the
[1404.16 --> 1404.98]  words that you
[1404.98 --> 1405.84]  use and the
[1405.84 --> 1406.20]  meaning you
[1406.22 --> 1407.74]  make matters.
[1409.76 --> 1410.12]  And as
[1410.12 --> 1411.86]  Christians in
[1411.86 --> 1413.16]  the world, you
[1413.16 --> 1414.54]  are a source
[1414.54 --> 1415.72]  of renewal
[1415.72 --> 1417.14]  and encouragement
[1417.14 --> 1418.44]  to those around
[1418.44 --> 1418.72]  you.
[1420.00 --> 1420.96]  Christians gotta
[1420.96 --> 1422.24]  be different.
[1424.06 --> 1424.54]  And if we
[1424.54 --> 1426.52]  talked, and if
[1426.52 --> 1426.98]  the language
[1426.98 --> 1427.88]  that we used
[1427.88 --> 1429.74]  was picked
[1429.74 --> 1430.82]  for us and
[1430.82 --> 1431.88]  by us with
[1431.88 --> 1432.72]  the goal of
[1432.72 --> 1434.46]  inspiring faithfulness
[1434.46 --> 1435.40]  to Jesus,
[1435.86 --> 1436.96]  bringing renewal
[1436.96 --> 1438.00]  and refreshment
[1438.00 --> 1438.46]  with our
[1438.46 --> 1438.84]  words,
[1440.68 --> 1441.16]  oh man,
[1442.10 --> 1443.22]  that would
[1443.22 --> 1443.74]  be
[1443.74 --> 1445.08]  different.
[1446.40 --> 1447.00]  Amen?
[1447.00 --> 1447.10]  Amen.
[1448.10 --> 1448.84]  Amen.
[1449.20 --> 1449.92]  Let's pray together.
[1449.92 --> 1458.42]  Lord our God,
[1458.50 --> 1458.82]  may the
[1458.82 --> 1459.52]  meditations of
[1459.52 --> 1459.92]  our heart
[1459.92 --> 1460.56]  and the
[1460.56 --> 1461.58]  words of
[1461.58 --> 1462.94]  our mouth
[1462.94 --> 1464.82]  be glorifying
[1464.82 --> 1466.04]  to you.
[1468.86 --> 1470.34]  Fix our eyes
[1470.34 --> 1471.30]  so fully
[1471.30 --> 1472.10]  on you,
[1472.40 --> 1473.02]  Lord Jesus.
[1473.02 --> 1476.30]  cause us to
[1476.30 --> 1477.16]  drink so
[1477.16 --> 1478.34]  deeply of the
[1478.34 --> 1479.06]  living waters
[1479.06 --> 1480.20]  of your gospel
[1480.20 --> 1480.88]  truth
[1480.88 --> 1484.10]  that from
[1484.10 --> 1486.00]  us pours
[1486.00 --> 1487.92]  out that
[1487.92 --> 1488.72]  same living
[1488.72 --> 1490.12]  water of speech
[1490.12 --> 1491.28]  for refreshment
[1491.28 --> 1492.52]  and renewal.
[1494.42 --> 1495.84]  May the very
[1495.84 --> 1497.36]  words we speak
[1497.36 --> 1498.18]  inspire
[1498.18 --> 1499.50]  faithfulness
[1499.50 --> 1500.92]  to you,
[1501.24 --> 1501.68]  Lord Jesus,
[1502.62 --> 1503.28]  and all
[1503.28 --> 1504.12]  those whom
[1504.12 --> 1504.66]  we meet,
[1505.58 --> 1506.16]  with all
[1506.16 --> 1507.20]  those whom
[1507.20 --> 1507.94]  we interact.
[1509.38 --> 1509.96]  Whatever
[1509.96 --> 1511.00]  context we
[1511.00 --> 1511.58]  may find
[1511.58 --> 1512.32]  ourselves in
[1512.32 --> 1512.88]  in the days
[1512.88 --> 1513.30]  and weeks
[1513.30 --> 1513.82]  and months
[1513.82 --> 1514.34]  to come,
[1515.68 --> 1516.08]  may our
[1516.08 --> 1516.86]  language
[1516.86 --> 1520.30]  utter words
[1520.30 --> 1521.40]  of praise
[1521.40 --> 1522.40]  be you.
[1523.40 --> 1523.88]  In Christ
[1523.88 --> 1524.38]  we pray.
[1525.56 --> 1525.90]  Amen.
