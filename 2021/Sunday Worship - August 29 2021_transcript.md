[546.06 --> 552.68]  For the souls of all who'd come, to the Father are restored.
[554.00 --> 561.86]  And the church of Christ was born, then the Spirit lit the flame.

[865.90 --> 870.90]  Our Father in heaven.
[870.90 --> 883.90]  Our Father in heaven.
[883.90 --> 885.90]  Our Father in heaven.
[885.90 --> 891.90]  Our Father in heaven.

[939.06 --> 943.50]  are a sure and steadfast honor of the soul.
[945.24 --> 950.52]  You are able for all time to save those who draw near to the Father through you,
[950.52 --> 955.52]  who lives to intercede and atonement for us all.
[957.24 --> 962.90]  In you, our Christ, abides the assurance of forgiveness we seek.
[964.16 --> 967.16]  And in your name alone we pray and give thanks.
[968.24 --> 968.62]  Amen.
[972.62 --> 975.04]  If you know actions, I encourage you to do them.
[975.42 --> 978.36]  It's hard to do them with only one hand, so I might not be able to join you.
[980.52 --> 995.52]  There is love that came for us,
[996.30 --> 1000.98]  Humble to our sinners' cross,
[1000.98 --> 1005.98]  Broke my shame and sinfulness,
[1005.98 --> 1010.98]  You rose again victorious.

[1020.42 --> 1025.38]  Through the storm and through the fire,
[1025.38 --> 1030.38]  There is truth that sets me free,
[1030.38 --> 1037.38]  Jesus Christ who lives in me.

[1043.38 --> 1048.38]  Sin is broken, you have saved me.

[1053.38 --> 1059.38]  Jesus you are Lord of all.

[1072.38 --> 1077.38]  You're my hope and my defense,
[1077.38 --> 1082.38]  You came to see and save the lost,
[1082.38 --> 1084.38]  You made it all upon the cross.
[1084.38 --> 1089.38]  You made it all upon the cross.
[1089.38 --> 1094.38]  You are stronger, you are stronger,
[1094.38 --> 1096.38]  You are stronger,
[1096.38 --> 1101.38]  Sin is broken, you have saved me.
[1101.38 --> 1103.38]  It is risen,
[1103.38 --> 1104.38]  It is risen,
[1104.38 --> 1106.38]  Christ is risen,
[1106.38 --> 1114.38]  Jesus you are Lord of all.

[1121.28 --> 1130.38]  So let Your name be lifted higher.

[1369.38 --> 1376.88]  It is well, it is well with my soul.

[1474.38 --> 1480.88]  O Lord, O my soul, it is well.
[1480.88 --> 1485.88]  It is well with my soul.

[1543.88 --> 1552.38]  It is well, it is well with my soul.
[1559.38 --> 1563.38]  I would love to invite all of the kids forward.
[1563.52 --> 1565.88]  You can come up here and join me at the front.

[1575.66 --> 1578.66]  Sorry, Courtney, my voice is terribly loud.
[1578.66 --> 1581.66]  Come on, join me up here.
[1581.66 --> 1583.66]  Have a seat, have a seat.
[1583.66 --> 1586.66]  How is everybody doing today?
[1586.66 --> 1589.66]  What did you do yesterday?
[1589.66 --> 1590.66]  Saturday?
[1590.66 --> 1594.66]  Anything fun and exciting?
[1594.66 --> 1595.66]  Yeah, Zoe?
[1595.66 --> 1598.66]  Oh, that's fun.
[1598.66 --> 1599.66]  You had a play date?
[1599.66 --> 1600.66]  You went shopping with your mom?
[1600.66 --> 1601.66]  Oh, very fun.
[1601.66 --> 1602.66]  With Malachi?
[1602.66 --> 1603.66]  Oh, was that exciting?
[1603.66 --> 1604.66]  Yeah?
[1604.66 --> 1607.66]  Anybody else do anything fun?
[1607.66 --> 1608.66]  No?
[1608.66 --> 1609.66]  Do you know what I did yesterday?
[1609.66 --> 1622.66]  All day, I hung out in the sun with a whole bunch of youth at our youth day camp.
[1622.66 --> 1624.66]  Doesn't that sound fun?
[1624.66 --> 1628.66]  There's not very many youth out there today because I think I tired them out.
[1628.66 --> 1630.66]  And guess where we did it?
[1630.66 --> 1631.66]  We did it at some of your friends' house.
[1631.66 --> 1634.66]  We went to Mr. and Mrs. Wynn's house.
[1634.66 --> 1639.66]  And I don't see any of them here either because I think I tired those kids out too.
[1639.66 --> 1642.66]  So we did a whole day and it was Olympic theme.
[1642.66 --> 1644.66]  Could you guys watch the Olympics this year?
[1644.66 --> 1645.66]  Did you see any of the Olympics?
[1645.66 --> 1646.66]  It's pretty fun, right?
[1646.66 --> 1648.66]  So we did an Olympic theme this year.
[1648.66 --> 1652.66]  So we had four teams and they had to do all sorts of fun Olympic challenges.
[1652.66 --> 1654.66]  So we had the COVID-lympics.
[1654.66 --> 1658.66]  We had to slingshot hand sanitizer with masks.
[1658.66 --> 1660.66]  We had food-lympics.
[1660.66 --> 1665.66]  So we mixed up different foods in a cup and had to drink it and figure out what four foods were in there.
[1665.66 --> 1672.66]  The hardest round was chocolate, pickles, and salt and vinegar chips.
[1673.66 --> 1674.66]  They didn't quite...
[1674.66 --> 1677.66]  Someone did eventually get it, but that was a hard round.
[1677.66 --> 1678.66]  And guess which team won?
[1678.66 --> 1681.66]  My team won.
[1681.66 --> 1684.66]  Yeah, because I was keeping score.
[1684.66 --> 1686.66]  Isn't that fun?
[1686.66 --> 1687.66]  So we also talked about...
[1687.66 --> 1690.66]  Did you know in the Bible they talk about races?
[1690.66 --> 1692.66]  Not really the Olympics, but they talk about sports.
[1692.66 --> 1698.66]  Paul says that we need to run this life like a race and we have to keep our eyes on the prize.
[1698.66 --> 1699.66]  What do you think he means?
[1699.66 --> 1702.66]  What's the prize do you think that Paul's talking about?
[1702.66 --> 1706.66]  When we live this life, we have to keep looking at one thing.
[1706.66 --> 1707.66]  What is that?
[1707.66 --> 1708.66]  It's a person.
[1708.66 --> 1709.66]  That's a hint.
[1709.66 --> 1710.66]  Yeah.
[1710.66 --> 1711.66]  Jesus.
[1711.66 --> 1712.66]  That's right.
[1712.66 --> 1715.66]  And we have to keep our eyes on Jesus and keep running towards him.
[1715.66 --> 1716.66]  And so we talked about that too.
[1716.66 --> 1717.66]  It was a very fun day.
[1717.66 --> 1725.66]  So today we're going to go to children's worship time in a second and you're going to talk a little bit more about what it means to live seeking Jesus.
[1725.66 --> 1726.66]  And so we're going to do that in a second.
[1726.66 --> 1731.66]  But before we do that, let me pray and then we will do the kids blessing to the church.
[1731.66 --> 1733.66]  And for those of you who don't know, I'll explain that too.
[1733.66 --> 1734.66]  Okay?
[1734.66 --> 1736.66]  So please bow your heads and then we'll do the kids blessing.
[1736.66 --> 1738.66]  Father God, thank you so much for this day.
[1738.66 --> 1742.66]  Thank you that we could come to church this morning and that we could be here as your body.
[1742.66 --> 1745.66]  We could sing songs and that we could open up the Bible and learn more about you.
[1745.66 --> 1753.66]  And as we go off to children's worship time and as some of us stay back here, we just pray that we will continue to learn more about you and what it is you are teaching us today.
[1753.66 --> 1755.66]  So we pray this in your name.
[1755.66 --> 1756.66]  Amen.
[1756.66 --> 1759.66]  Okay, so in a second we're going to stand up and we're going to do the kids blessing.
[1759.66 --> 1761.66]  And so I see there might be some new faces here.
[1761.66 --> 1766.66]  What that means is we're going to stand up and we're going to look at the church and we're going to say, put our hands like this.
[1766.66 --> 1769.66]  And then we're going to say, the Lord be with you.
[1769.66 --> 1771.66]  And then they're going to reply and also with you.
[1771.66 --> 1772.66]  Okay?
[1772.66 --> 1774.66]  So let's stand up and we'll say it together.
[1774.66 --> 1775.66]  And the church is going to do the same.
[1775.66 --> 1776.66]  Let's look at them.
[1776.66 --> 1780.66]  And then I'll say one, two, three, and then we'll say it together.
[1780.66 --> 1781.66]  You ready?
[1781.66 --> 1782.66]  One, two, three.
[1782.66 --> 1787.66]  One, two, three.
[1787.66 --> 1788.66]  All right.
[1788.66 --> 1791.66]  If you are in kindergarten or younger, we've got children's worship time for you.
[1791.66 --> 1793.66]  So you can head to that class right now.
[1793.66 --> 1796.66]  And if you are older than that, then you can head to sit back with your parents.
[1796.66 --> 1797.66]  So I'm going to pay for the parents.
[1797.66 --> 1798.66]  찬icumals to work.
[1798.66 --> 1799.66]  And then if you are ready to take things together.
[1799.66 --> 1802.66]  So we need to make it bigger you know, past theääd achieved at the same time.
[1806.66 --> 1808.66]  Davidнуть then, when they're riskier.
[1808.66 --> 1809.66]  And then there's going to be people with handing people meinem Christ.
[1809.66 --> 1811.66]  He's older than the family minister that's ever gave Aad.
[1811.66 --> 1813.66]  He's also very icononic.
[1813.66 --> 1815.66]  And then he added to home stage you said to them.
[1815.66 --> 1845.64]  Thank you.
[1845.66 --> 1848.30]  A couple of announcements before we go to our congregational prayer this morning.
[1849.32 --> 1858.70]  First is that Annalise and Matt Birkenpass had a baby boy this past Thursday, and his name is Reuben Theodore.
[1862.94 --> 1867.42]  And Annalise and Reuben are back at home and doing very well.
[1867.42 --> 1878.84]  The second announcement is that next Sunday, we will be celebrating the Lord's Supper.
[1879.48 --> 1882.74]  So take some time this week to prepare yourself for that.
[1883.14 --> 1887.08]  And if your children are participating, take time to prepare them for that as well.
[1887.08 --> 1891.02]  Let's go to God in prayer.
[1893.02 --> 1899.76]  Father in heaven, as we come to you in prayer this morning, we echo the words written in Psalm 46.
[1899.76 --> 1905.48]  God is our refuge and our strength, an ever-present help in trouble.
[1906.80 --> 1912.46]  Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea.
[1913.42 --> 1918.14]  Though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging,
[1918.78 --> 1925.64]  there is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells.
[1925.64 --> 1927.56]  God is within her.
[1928.44 --> 1929.52]  She will not fall.
[1930.44 --> 1933.12]  God will help her at the break of day.
[1933.96 --> 1935.18]  Nations are in uproar.
[1935.78 --> 1936.56]  Kingdoms fall.
[1937.78 --> 1940.18]  He lifts his voice and the earth melts.
[1941.52 --> 1942.98]  The Lord Almighty is with us.
[1943.40 --> 1945.78]  The God of Jacob is our fortress.
[1947.76 --> 1950.24]  Lord, thank you for the words of the psalmist.
[1950.24 --> 1955.82]  And we ask that you enable us to have this kind of unwavering confidence in you.
[1957.52 --> 1963.44]  Lord, we give you thanks with Annalise and Matt, with the birth of their son.
[1964.42 --> 1966.12]  What a tremendous blessing that is, Lord.
[1966.26 --> 1973.68]  And we just ask that you bless them as he's welcomed into their household and bless their household.
[1974.98 --> 1977.90]  Just thank you for that lovely gift of new life.
[1977.90 --> 1984.44]  Father, we lift up the Miles family to you after Mike passed away recently.
[1985.40 --> 1992.38]  We ask that each family member will experience your comforting peace in the days, weeks, and months ahead.
[1994.30 --> 1999.16]  This week, we saw the terrible situation which is unfolding in Afghanistan.
[2000.62 --> 2004.86]  Be with those who fear for their lives and are desperate to leave that country.
[2004.86 --> 2012.62]  Although the probability of leaving appears remote, we ask that you provide some way for them to leave.
[2019.28 --> 2020.20]  Devastating earthquake.
[2021.16 --> 2023.64]  The people of this country have suffered so much.
[2024.44 --> 2028.88]  We ask for your blessing on the work of relief agencies, such as World Renew,
[2028.88 --> 2033.62]  who are working there to bring food, shelter, and hope to the Haitians.
[2034.82 --> 2037.54]  Help us to give generously to support this work.
[2039.48 --> 2044.94]  We thank you for the cooler and wetter weather, which is having a positive impact on the forest fires in this province.
[2045.98 --> 2048.84]  Watch over all those who are actively fighting these fires.
[2048.84 --> 2055.88]  And grant your blessing to those who have been displaced or have lost homes or businesses to the fires.
[2058.20 --> 2063.44]  And as we head to a national election, we ask for your blessing on that process.
[2064.60 --> 2068.90]  Raise up leaders who recognize your authority and seek to do your will.
[2068.90 --> 2076.64]  Watch over those who are shut in, isolated, alone, or suffering from depression.
[2078.08 --> 2080.40]  Walk beside them every day.
[2081.06 --> 2083.98]  And give that we may reach out in meaningful ways to them.
[2086.94 --> 2090.88]  Father, as we start a new church here, we ask for your blessing on the ministries of this church.
[2091.74 --> 2093.86]  Thank you for the many volunteers who serve here.
[2093.86 --> 2097.88]  And we ask that you strengthen and encourage them in their service.
[2098.82 --> 2105.90]  If there are vacant positions in any of the ministries, we ask, Lord, that you would raise up people who are willing to serve in that capacity.
[2107.48 --> 2114.60]  We also ask that you grant the leadership of this church wisdom to discern your will for this church and the courage to act on it.
[2116.30 --> 2118.00]  Watch over those who are on vacation.
[2119.08 --> 2120.32]  Give them traveling mercies.
[2120.82 --> 2122.96]  And grant them a time of rest and renewal.
[2124.54 --> 2127.84]  Bless our students and teachers as they prepare for a new school year.
[2128.56 --> 2131.08]  Keep them safe when they return to the classroom environment.
[2132.82 --> 2139.58]  This morning, we thank you that Tim and Charity could join us and share their ministry with the indigenous people of Shushwap.
[2140.50 --> 2142.82]  And we ask that you bless their ministry.
[2142.82 --> 2149.74]  As we go to today's message, we ask that you plant the truth of your word in our hearts.
[2151.28 --> 2162.76]  We ask that through your spirit, we may lead this service being renewed, encouraged, and equipped to reflect the glory of Christ in all that we do and say, amen.
[2162.76 --> 2162.86]  Amen.
[2162.86 --> 2162.92]  Amen.
[2162.92 --> 2162.98]  Amen.
[2162.98 --> 2164.92]  Amen.
[2164.92 --> 2166.92]  Amen.
[2166.92 --> 2167.00]  Amen.
[2167.00 --> 2167.04]  Amen.
[2167.04 --> 2169.04]  Amen.
[2169.04 --> 2171.04]  Amen.
[2171.04 --> 2171.08]  Amen.
[2171.08 --> 2172.80]  Amen.
[2172.82 --> 2202.80]  Amen.
[2202.82 --> 2204.82]  Amen.
[2204.82 --> 2208.82]  Amen.
[2208.82 --> 2210.82]  Amen.
[2210.82 --> 2212.82]  Amen.
[2212.82 --> 2214.82]  Amen.
[2214.82 --> 2216.82]  Amen.
[2216.82 --> 2218.82]  Amen.
[2218.82 --> 2220.82]  Amen.
[2220.82 --> 2222.82]  Amen.
[2222.82 --> 2224.82]  Amen.
[2224.82 --> 2230.38]  As these guys are bringing out this last item, let's thank them for their work.
[2230.38 --> 2230.82]  Amen.
[2230.82 --> 2231.82]  Amen.
[2231.82 --> 2235.82]  Amen.
[2235.82 --> 2237.82]  I'm done.
[2237.82 --> 2255.54]  shouted from
[2255.54 --> 2261.10]  solicited your questions and then we've spent the summer addressing them as they've come.
[2262.22 --> 2266.14]  Tim and Charity were scheduled to come earlier in the year but because of the forest fire
[2266.14 --> 2271.06]  situation they were unable to do that and then gratefully we've been able to reschedule
[2271.06 --> 2275.00]  to today. And so Tim and Charity I'm going to invite you guys to come to the front.
[2276.44 --> 2279.34]  I didn't clear this with you yet but the love seat is yours.
[2281.56 --> 2284.18]  So control yourselves.
[2285.54 --> 2295.72]  By way of introduction to our conversation this morning I just want to reiterate the fact that
[2295.72 --> 2302.74]  we believe here that it's really important to have hard conversations and to address
[2302.74 --> 2310.30]  hard questions. And I know that oftentimes when we do these teaching series, is it awkward if you're
[2310.30 --> 2313.16]  sitting behind me because it's weird when you're standing behind me?
[2315.54 --> 2324.72]  We know that addressing these questions can often lead to asking more questions and that's a good
[2324.72 --> 2330.68]  thing. We want to encourage that. And so if you have any questions following this service or any of our
[2330.68 --> 2334.86]  other services you can email me at pastorchris.ca.
[2334.86 --> 2338.86]  Were you expecting something different?
[2338.86 --> 2342.82]  I watch the services I miss. I know what goes on here.
[2346.02 --> 2351.86]  But in all honesty please do email me or reach out, grab me after the service or any one of us
[2351.86 --> 2356.38]  on pastoral staff here. We want to engage in your conversations and questions.
[2357.78 --> 2358.86]  I'm going to sit down now.
[2363.54 --> 2369.46]  Okay. So for those of you who don't know Tim and Charity, we're going to let them introduce themselves
[2369.46 --> 2377.22]  in just a moment. Before we do that, I want to sort of state the reality of the situation
[2377.22 --> 2384.00]  and the circumstance that we find ourselves in. So the question that we are addressing and that we
[2384.00 --> 2389.54]  are going to spend some time reflecting on together has to do with the history of Christianity
[2389.54 --> 2395.94]  in relationship to the indigenous population, primarily here in Canada, but we know that globally
[2395.94 --> 2401.50]  it always hasn't been a good opportunity and a good representation of the values of Jesus.
[2401.50 --> 2407.92]  In Canada, we have our own history with residential schools. And so we want to enter into this
[2407.92 --> 2414.36]  conversation about how are we supposed to engage in indigenous ministry? How are we supposed to,
[2414.50 --> 2422.32]  as Christians, relate to the history of residential schools and the terrible heartbreak that surrounds
[2422.32 --> 2429.52]  that for our indigenous family members and citizens here in our country?
[2429.52 --> 2440.24]  Some of you recall that at the beginning of the summer, the bodies of 215 children were discovered at the
[2440.24 --> 2451.66]  Kamloops Indian School from the Tukumloops to Sakepwem First Nation. A few weeks later, right on the heels of that,
[2451.66 --> 2458.10]  almost 750 unmarked graves were found at the Kawasis First Nation in Saskatchewan.
[2458.10 --> 2465.50]  And really, if you've been following this history and paying attention to the broader conversation,
[2465.90 --> 2471.14]  that shouldn't surprise us because the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was something
[2471.14 --> 2475.68]  commissioned by our government many years ago and happened in conversation with the indigenous
[2475.68 --> 2482.82]  population, already stated that there are unmarked graves and there are bodies that will be found if
[2482.82 --> 2487.02]  we were willing to look. And until recently, we haven't been that willing to look.
[2490.14 --> 2497.28]  And our heart, rightly, breaks in stories like this. And most of us can't even begin to imagine
[2497.28 --> 2503.00]  what that experience is like for the community of the indigenous population.
[2503.00 --> 2511.72]  Additionally, you have what came out of that, right, in the so-called burn it all down movement,
[2511.72 --> 2520.46]  which for some people had the stated goal of what's called decolonization, but which for others just
[2520.46 --> 2528.28]  simply led to the opportunism and the burning of vandalism of over 45 churches since those children's
[2528.28 --> 2534.20]  bodies were found in Kamloops. In fact, there's a connection to our church in that some of you
[2534.20 --> 2540.34]  know that the Egyptian Orthodox Church that was burned down around here was the one which the Murad
[2540.34 --> 2544.84]  family, which is one of our refugee sponsorship families, they worshipped there with their Christian
[2544.84 --> 2553.20]  community. The point is, of course, is that all of this, right, from our heartbreak at the injustice
[2553.20 --> 2561.20]  to the way people respond in the present matters. And it is important for us to have discussions around
[2561.20 --> 2567.68]  this. It's important for us to be engaging in these sorts of conversations. I have a colleague,
[2567.68 --> 2577.88]  her name is Shannon Perez. She is part of the Sayasi Dene First Nation from Winnipeg. And she says that
[2577.88 --> 2587.08]  we all live downstream of these histories. And so we all have a responsibility to live well within them
[2587.08 --> 2598.04]  together. When this first happened with the bodies found in the Kamloops, I did a pastor study video
[2598.04 --> 2605.06]  on our YouTube page. And you are invited to search for that and to follow up to that. We go into some of
[2605.06 --> 2609.54]  the theological principles and realities behind discerning that we're going to hit on some of
[2609.54 --> 2615.40]  that today, but we're also going to hear a more personal story and a more personal engagement with
[2615.40 --> 2621.74]  this reality. And so with that introduction and setting of the stage, I want to introduce
[2621.74 --> 2628.52]  some of you for the first time. Others have met them before, but this is Tim and Charity Johnson.
[2628.52 --> 2634.16]  This is Charity, and that's Tim, if that wasn't clear. And they work with the North American
[2634.16 --> 2641.50]  Indigenous Ministries called NAME here in BC in the Shuswap area. And so Tim and Charity, thank you,
[2641.50 --> 2645.64]  first of all, for being here. And I'm so excited that we could do this in person and live and that
[2645.64 --> 2651.68]  we could make that work with everything. Can you start by introducing yourselves a little bit?
[2652.14 --> 2658.94]  Tell us about NAME, but also we had to reschedule this because of the wildfires in your area.
[2658.94 --> 2664.62]  Is there anything that you can share with us about that that we might be able to pray for and impact
[2664.62 --> 2672.86]  on your community as well by way of introduction? Okay. Quite a quiet tip. Tim Johnson, Risk West.
[2673.28 --> 2681.62]  It means hello, everybody. My name is Tim Johnson. And my wife, Charity, and I, we've been involved in
[2681.62 --> 2688.64]  Native Ministry for the last, like, I've been involved in Native Ministry for the last 20 years.
[2690.46 --> 2698.76]  And so we've been involved with it full time for the last about 10 years. And it's been a blessing.
[2699.44 --> 2707.90]  So it's been an amazing people group to be able to work with. But at the same time, like, we,
[2707.90 --> 2712.26]  so one of the things I want to canvas right off the bat is I don't have all the answers,
[2712.94 --> 2718.14]  especially as a guy who has, like, Dutch descent, like, I'm not going to be able to be the voice of
[2718.14 --> 2724.28]  the people. But we can speak from where we've, like, the conversations we've had in the community,
[2724.42 --> 2730.28]  the conversations we've had with elders, with the youth, with all the people that we work with,
[2730.28 --> 2737.90]  like a lot of the community that we call pretty much family. So it's, it's been definitely trying
[2737.90 --> 2744.14]  with, with all the wildfires, we were kind of on the edge of, like, an evacuation alert the last time
[2744.14 --> 2749.40]  that we were wanting to come out here. So then we were like, well, if the fire, if the wind blows a
[2749.40 --> 2754.54]  certain direction, I was like, then it's going to be really risky coming down. So that's why we were,
[2754.54 --> 2759.88]  we had to, we had to postpone, but I'm so glad that we were able to make it out and, and actually come
[2759.88 --> 2766.36]  and speak on, on some of this heavy stuff. Because it's, it's, it is, it's a heavy subject matter,
[2766.36 --> 2772.80]  but it's definitely, definitely a conversation that's good to have. So, yeah, did you have?
[2774.16 --> 2783.18]  My background is, I come from Saskatchewan, in Canada, born and raised. And the, the way things look
[2783.18 --> 2790.14]  back in Saskatchewan with relations, um, with those who are living on reserve is, um, a little bit
[2790.14 --> 2795.92]  different than here, but there are a lot of similarities. Um, one thing that we practice
[2795.92 --> 2801.64]  when we travel out towards, um, visiting my family is figuring out whose territory we're on.
[2802.80 --> 2807.12]  Because, uh, it's easy to teach the kids that we're going through Alberta and then Saskatchewan
[2807.12 --> 2813.46]  in the Manitoba comes next. And then something, um, that's just a part of our reality now is learning
[2813.46 --> 2821.46]  whose territory, um, whose land, um, and unceded territory we're on. And we got help because our,
[2821.46 --> 2829.74]  um, operations director in name actually lives in Langley here. And so he mentioned it overlaps with the
[2829.74 --> 2835.58]  unceded traditional and ancestral lands of, and forgive me for the way I'm pronouncing these,
[2835.58 --> 2841.92]  stories. Sometimes it's, uh, a bit difficult, but it's the effort that counts. Um, Kwantlen, Musqueam,
[2841.92 --> 2844.32]  Kat, Katesi, you go for it.
[2844.32 --> 2854.54]  Okay. So Kwantlen, Musqueam, Katesi, Semyamu, Tswassen, Kwaiokwet, and Kwikwetlem people.
[2854.54 --> 2863.58]  Um, and so name, name has been around for, name's been around for, oh, I don't know, a long time. Um,
[2863.58 --> 2869.88]  and I should know these numbers, but I don't. Um, but anyways, it's, uh, it started out as a marine
[2869.88 --> 2874.60]  medical mission. So what they originally started doing was they started going in boats and then
[2874.60 --> 2880.10]  they would go all the way up the coast of BC and they would just start, uh, just kind of treating
[2880.10 --> 2885.36]  people and just trying to love on communities. And, uh, and so they did a lot of medical sort of
[2885.36 --> 2890.60]  outreach, but then through that, they also got the opportunity to be, be able to share the gospel,
[2890.60 --> 2895.74]  which is a really cool opportunity. And then it's just kind of morphed after that to figuring
[2895.74 --> 2901.94]  out ways of kind of moving more inland and seeing how we can kind of implement. Uh, so a lot of the
[2901.94 --> 2907.68]  stuff that Charity and I do, we do a lot of stuff with youth, uh, but it's not the, it's not the
[2907.68 --> 2912.02]  narrowest, uh, part of our scope. It was nice hearing Kevin and all the different Olympics that
[2912.02 --> 2917.30]  they had, cause that's a lot of the stuff that we do, which is a lot of fun. Um, but yeah, so it's just,
[2917.30 --> 2922.88]  it's a matter of engaging the youth with all these different fun and really odd, uh, activities
[2922.88 --> 2927.88]  sometimes. Uh, but at the same time using that as a tool and a catalyst to be able to share the gospel.
[2927.88 --> 2934.28]  Uh, so the big thing for us has been just developing that relationship first and just loving the
[2934.28 --> 2939.78]  community first. Uh, and then, then I feel like then you have some, a spot to be able to speak from.
[2939.78 --> 2948.18]  Um, so yeah. And, and, and like, like we were saying before, um, that because of the, or because
[2948.18 --> 2954.14]  of the, the history with residential schools, we are very, very gentle with how we come in with the
[2954.14 --> 2960.74]  gospel. Um, we are, we're not the type that will just come in and say, well, this about your culture
[2960.74 --> 2965.52]  is bad and you need to change this. Like, cause it's like, no, that's terrible. Like that's,
[2965.52 --> 2970.66]  so we, we come in, we came in as learners first and foremost, we started learning the language.
[2970.66 --> 2975.90]  We started learning about the culture. Uh, and man, there's so many different things that,
[2976.04 --> 2984.76]  um, just swap over easily with, uh, with, with our, with our faith as well. Um, so there was some
[2984.76 --> 2988.82]  stuff that was an easy switch over. There's some stuff where it's like, okay, now we got to figure
[2988.82 --> 2994.72]  out, is this redeemable? Is this something that can be, that can, that can glorify God still through
[2994.72 --> 3000.36]  these different things? And, uh, so it's been a, it's been a really neat journey. Um, and it's
[3000.36 --> 3005.02]  been also really cool to see how we can encourage kind of the first nations Christians as well
[3005.02 --> 3011.26]  around us. Um, but yeah, yeah. And I, and I think, I think the total number of bodies that have been
[3011.26 --> 3019.64]  found in Canada is over like 5,000, I think now. Um, and I was talking to, it was interesting when,
[3019.64 --> 3024.62]  when the news first came out, I started having, it was, it was a, it was a blessing and a curse.
[3024.74 --> 3028.42]  Like it was a curse in the fact that it was like, that's terrible. That should have never happened.
[3029.02 --> 3033.90]  Uh, but it was a blessing in the sense that it was like, okay, now that it's out on the table,
[3033.90 --> 3040.38]  let's talk about it. Uh, and it kind of opened up some wounds for some people. Um, but at the same
[3040.38 --> 3047.42]  time, it also gave the opportunity to be able to move some past, past a few traumas and past some stuff
[3047.42 --> 3053.12]  that has happened in the, in the past as well. And, and to start this conversation. Um, but it was
[3053.12 --> 3058.34]  interesting because, uh, I started talking to some of the elders and I was like, how does this hit you?
[3058.50 --> 3065.70]  Like, how does this affect you? And a lot of them were like, they're like, it sucks. Like, they're like,
[3065.70 --> 3071.92]  we, we definitely, uh, are hurt by it, but they're like, we, we always knew it happened. Like, they're
[3071.92 --> 3078.56]  like, if you talk to any of the elders, they, they have multiple stories of horrific tragedies of stuff
[3078.56 --> 3084.08]  that happened in the residential schools. Uh, and, and then they also have lots of stories of like, how
[3084.08 --> 3089.82]  all of a sudden so-and-so just wasn't there the next day. And so they would start asking questions
[3089.82 --> 3095.08]  like, what happened to Johnny? Like, and they're like, and they never got any answers or they would get beat
[3095.08 --> 3100.98]  if they started asking questions like that. Um, so it was, it was, there was, there was a lot of,
[3101.28 --> 3107.10]  but, and I think it was also kind of, uh, refreshing for a lot of the elders to be able to have that,
[3107.72 --> 3111.82]  to have that news out. And it was, it was an interesting thing because they were like,
[3112.54 --> 3117.82]  one of the things that continually came up was, we've been telling everybody this for years.
[3118.42 --> 3122.46]  They're like that. And that was the big thing is they're like, we've been saying this,
[3122.46 --> 3128.72]  like, this has been our conversation that we've had, but it, it, and it's kind of interesting when
[3128.72 --> 3136.02]  you look at it from a North American Western white perspective. It's like, it's not until we have
[3136.02 --> 3141.42]  hard evidence and facts that all of a sudden we're like, oh shoot, this was a bad thing. And it was
[3141.42 --> 3145.48]  like, and that's when it, I think that's when it set in for a lot of people and they're like, oh no,
[3145.56 --> 3150.82]  what do we do with this now? Uh, so it's been, uh, that's been a good thing is just seeing how many
[3150.82 --> 3155.56]  people are like, okay, now that we have been presented with this information and, and these
[3155.56 --> 3161.58]  tragedies, how do we, how do we move forward from here? Uh, and so that's been kind of the cool,
[3161.96 --> 3168.06]  the, the neat, um, the neat journey that we've been on. Um, and then one of the things that I was
[3168.06 --> 3174.00]  going to say was, uh, just about like the church burning side of things, like that, that was a cool
[3174.00 --> 3179.72]  conversation I had with some of the, some, some other people in the community. Um, just where,
[3179.94 --> 3185.26]  cause I was like, cause they, they actually brought it up and they're like, what they're doing right
[3185.26 --> 3189.60]  now with the whole like church burning thing, they're like, that's not our way. And they're
[3189.60 --> 3195.30]  like, I would be very surprised if it was actually our people that were doing it because they're like,
[3195.36 --> 3200.20]  that's not our way. And, and I was like, and, and actually it's come out in the news a lot where
[3200.20 --> 3206.30]  it's, it's not even first nations people that are doing it. Uh, but it's actually other, other,
[3206.30 --> 3212.88]  uh, uh, other backgrounds and other races that are acting on behalf of the first nations. And,
[3212.88 --> 3218.32]  and I mean, I get it. People are, people are angry. People are worked up. Um, but yeah,
[3218.42 --> 3222.30]  it was interesting to hear from the community themselves. They're like, that's not our way.
[3222.36 --> 3228.48]  That's not the way we go about things. Uh, and even one of the ladies was like the whole forest fire
[3228.48 --> 3233.40]  situation right now. She's like, that might be the creator's way of kind of purging,
[3233.74 --> 3238.66]  purging things right now and kind of doing a cleanse on, in the community or in the,
[3238.74 --> 3243.56]  in the area. And I was like, well, it's, it's an interesting, uh, perspective for sure.
[3244.84 --> 3251.64]  And I just wanted to add, I think the biggest thing too is just, um, when you do hear those stories,
[3251.64 --> 3258.84]  you listen with a very, very attentive ear to their story with compassion and not with pity.
[3260.06 --> 3264.92]  Um, we were just hanging out at the beach the one day and there is a story that there was the man who
[3264.92 --> 3269.06]  was sitting on the stairs and we had no idea who he was, but we were just all having fun in the lake
[3269.06 --> 3276.64]  and in the water. And he's like, man, I pity you guys. And I was like, who are you? And then he just
[3276.64 --> 3282.68]  got up to leave and he's like, oh, I pity you guys. And we're like, is this a there? And they
[3282.68 --> 3288.46]  were even just kind of baffled and trying to decide, is this a, is this a good or is this,
[3288.62 --> 3294.86]  are you meaning this for malintent? Where are you? So I just think that, um, if you do come across
[3294.86 --> 3299.42]  first nations people and they're going to share their stories, they all come from different walks.
[3299.42 --> 3305.26]  Like they all have their own different story to tell, just listen with understanding and compassion
[3305.26 --> 3310.22]  and then, um, build relationship from there. If you want to carry on.
[3314.22 --> 3320.34]  You've, uh, started, uh, alluding to it a little bit, but I wonder if you can,
[3320.34 --> 3327.50]  especially in the, the immediate aftermath of the discovery of the 215 bodies in your
[3327.50 --> 3332.72]  community, um, what did your ministry look like, uh, in those moments? What was that like? I know
[3332.72 --> 3338.32]  charity, we talked briefly and, uh, you had mentioned explicitly that as a mother, right,
[3338.36 --> 3342.68]  your experience was a little bit different than even Tim, as you were engaging in this. And so maybe
[3342.68 --> 3349.06]  both of you can just take a couple minutes and address that. Yeah. So, uh, a big thing was, uh,
[3349.06 --> 3356.14]  we actually partnered with, um, the band, uh, some of the local bands in the area and they had a
[3356.14 --> 3360.34]  walking our spirits home sort of thing. It's kind of a memorial thing where we walked from
[3360.34 --> 3366.62]  the Kamloops residential school back to the reserve and back to some of the communities.
[3368.06 --> 3374.78]  And, uh, and it was, uh, it was, uh, it was a really powerful, uh, amazing experience. We were able to,
[3374.78 --> 3380.76]  uh, but charity and I both were able to, uh, to volunteer and help, uh, do, do some driving and
[3380.76 --> 3386.38]  our kids were able to walk in it as well and to be able to support the community, uh, in that way.
[3386.38 --> 3391.00]  Uh, and so that's, that's, that was a big thing is for us is we've just been sitting there and we've
[3391.00 --> 3397.50]  just been like, we're here for you. Like we care. Uh, and, and it's coming to that whole, like, um,
[3397.50 --> 3403.40]  recognizing, recognizing that that happened. And I think there's a lot of, there's a lot of, uh,
[3404.20 --> 3409.16]  there's a lot of restoration that can come from even just the whole, like, recognizing that it
[3409.16 --> 3415.54]  happened, being like, that's terrible that that happened to you. Um, and, uh, and, and for us,
[3415.54 --> 3421.52]  it's been, it's been just, uh, and it's also opened up a lot of different conversations. Um, there's a lot
[3421.52 --> 3426.34]  of times where people were like, is it sketchy? Like, is it, or is it hard to be where you guys are at?
[3426.34 --> 3432.66]  And I was like, man, like it's, if anything, it just opened up more conversations of like,
[3433.32 --> 3439.16]  um, I had a talk with an elder and he was, uh, he was telling me some of the stories of some of the
[3439.16 --> 3446.10]  stuff that happened, uh, in the residential school. And it's, it was, it was, it was really graphic and
[3446.10 --> 3452.48]  it was really just super disturbing. And he's like, Tim, he's like, you know, the only thing that can,
[3452.48 --> 3458.38]  that comes to my mind, like the only word that comes to my mind is evil. And I was like, dude,
[3458.42 --> 3463.18]  I totally agree with you. I was like, I am totally on board. I was like, what they did was wrong.
[3463.56 --> 3469.08]  I was like a hundred percent. And, uh, and I was like, and the interesting thing is, is I said,
[3469.14 --> 3474.64]  they call themselves Christians. But I said, if you look at what a Christian is, I said, Jesus boils
[3474.64 --> 3480.06]  it down to two things. He said, he said, it's somebody who loves God as he's, it's somebody who loves
[3480.06 --> 3485.64]  God and loves others. I was like, it just kind of boils down to that. I said, so those people that
[3485.64 --> 3494.30]  were beating, abusing, raping, like, uh, I was like, were those people, were those people being
[3494.30 --> 3498.60]  loving and like, were they loving God and were they loving others? And they're like, he's like, no.
[3498.82 --> 3503.60]  And I was like, those people weren't Christians. I was like, those were imposters. And so, and it's
[3503.60 --> 3509.00]  been interesting too, because there's been even more conversations coming out about some of the
[3509.00 --> 3514.96]  people that, uh, ran some of the residential schools, uh, being that they, that they just
[3514.96 --> 3520.34]  got like a work abroad sort of, um, uh, ticket. And they were like, Hey, sweet, I get to work
[3520.34 --> 3524.66]  in a foreign country. This is going to be neat. And, uh, and they weren't even really part of
[3524.66 --> 3528.70]  the church. And it was, it was interesting to see how there's a lot of people who slipped
[3528.70 --> 3534.58]  in that definitely shouldn't have been there. Um, and, but I think just, uh, just having those
[3534.58 --> 3540.40]  conversations and just opening it up, uh, which is, it's, it's opened up a lot of really good
[3540.40 --> 3544.18]  ways to be able to share the gospel and to be able to share what, who, who a Christian
[3544.18 --> 3547.78]  is and what, um, a Christ follower actually looks like.
[3548.84 --> 3554.78]  Yeah, we have a beautiful opportunity to, opportunity to be Christ representatives here
[3554.78 --> 3560.92]  on earth. And I just hope and pray that we all take that to heart and, um, and, and, and
[3560.92 --> 3569.68]  do it with all, all our, all our effort. Um, I was going to respond with two things. One
[3569.68 --> 3573.98]  is what a counselor said, but I can't remember word for word because I'm not a detail person.
[3575.84 --> 3582.78]  Um, and then the other thing was, um, just as representatives. Um, so when we were on that
[3582.78 --> 3590.90]  walk, um, you can tell from the trauma from the past, a lot of people, um, and, um, and, um,
[3590.90 --> 3597.90]  people's, um, uh, guards go up or what, how should I describe it when RCMP were helping. Um,
[3597.90 --> 3604.90]  and, uh, and I still know it's still triggers from the trauma from the background. Ah, they're
[3604.90 --> 3610.90]  here, they're here. What are they doing? And they had every good intention for them and to
[3610.90 --> 3617.90]  just love on them and help, um, you know, prepare the way, like the roadway before them and stuff
[3617.90 --> 3622.90]  like that. And just to make sure that it was, uh, you know, if anybody wanted to, you know,
[3622.90 --> 3628.90]  counter attack or whatever, they were there to support, um, the efforts that were being
[3628.90 --> 3634.90]  made there, but it was really, really, um, eyeopening to see, yeah, those triggers pop
[3634.90 --> 3640.90]  up. And then just a, quite a few conversations just with friends back home, just charity. I
[3640.90 --> 3647.90]  have a five year old, I have a, that forced assimilation. They're like, I couldn't live
[3647.90 --> 3655.90]  with that. Like forcing, you know, taking your children away and that's big time hit home.
[3655.90 --> 3662.90]  Um, and so we, as women, um, have a crying session and they are still very much guard their children
[3662.90 --> 3671.90]  a lot. And the one council member cried before her people at the end of the walk when we got
[3671.90 --> 3682.90]  to the gym for a, um, just a gathering time. Um, um, she, um, said, I, I am striving very
[3682.90 --> 3689.90]  hard to put a stop to the generational, um, trauma, but it was, she said it in another way
[3689.90 --> 3696.90]  too, or I want to get past this. I want to get past this. And then I was in a situation one evening
[3696.90 --> 3704.90]  with a lady from the reserve and on our drive about, and it was a kind of a crisis situation.
[3704.90 --> 3711.90]  I just looked at her and I said, well, what do you do when, like, what do you have anything? Like,
[3711.90 --> 3718.90]  do you have anything to, I have Jesus to rest on when I, my heart is so troubled and stirred up.
[3718.90 --> 3723.90]  And I was like, let's sing, let's pray. Can you pray? I don't know how to pray.
[3723.90 --> 3728.90]  So there's a lot of things that there's a lot of, um, situations where, yeah, they just don't
[3728.90 --> 3734.90]  have any foundational grounding that we all have. Like, like the fact that we have the body of Christ
[3734.90 --> 3740.90]  and we have Jesus is just such a gift to be able to give, especially in moments of crisis
[3740.90 --> 3745.90]  and devastation. I'm glad we have that.
[3745.90 --> 3748.90]  Thank you.
[3748.90 --> 3755.90]  Um, so there's a couple of themes that I want to pick up on and maybe Charity will start with you.
[3755.90 --> 3761.90]  Um, it's something that you don't have to answer necessarily, but it's something I'm highlighting as I listen.
[3761.90 --> 3766.90]  Um, I shared with you in, in advance of this, a quote from Ray Aldred.
[3766.90 --> 3770.90]  Ray Aldred is at the Vancouver School of Theology.
[3770.90 --> 3773.90]  He's the director of indigenous studies there.
[3773.90 --> 3778.90]  Uh, and he said, when a nation state thinks it can bring heaven down to earth,
[3778.90 --> 3781.90]  it only ends up bringing hell up.
[3781.90 --> 3788.90]  And as I listen to, especially Charity, as you just reflected, some of the trauma and conversations,
[3788.90 --> 3798.90]  um, part of me wants to say, well, God bless you and thank you for entering into that hell of trauma with, with people.
[3798.90 --> 3810.90]  Um, I wonder how, do you, do you have a word for us and how we might, uh, do that as well when it comes to the,
[3810.90 --> 3815.90]  when it comes to the first nations people?
[3815.90 --> 3823.90]  Um, there's a, I mean, I should have probably, but there's a section in this book that we want to gift you guys with.
[3823.90 --> 3825.90]  It's on page 27.
[3825.90 --> 3830.90]  Um, I wonder if I can just find that, uh, where I want to go.
[3830.90 --> 3839.90]  I don't want to lose my train of thought, but, um, I'm just going to read it just really quick, um, where we can go with it.
[3839.90 --> 3843.90]  Um, where we can go with it, with those, with those traumas and stuff like that.
[3843.90 --> 3845.90]  And it's just a starting point, just a starting point.
[3845.90 --> 3850.90]  But I really believe the Holy Spirit will just move in you and speak through you when the time comes.
[3850.90 --> 3853.90]  Um, um, if need be, right.
[3853.90 --> 3857.90]  But the biggest thing is just listen and listening to those traumas.
[3857.90 --> 3870.90]  And sometimes it's just healing when they can just get it out and then you just hear it and then pray for them quietly, like, you know, or just say, um, thanks for sharing that.
[3870.90 --> 3876.90]  And then I'm going to, I'm going to be praying and meditating on that, you know, for a while longer here.
[3876.90 --> 3883.90]  And then maybe high hopes that, you know, maybe we can meet again so that you affirm also like what they're saying.
[3883.90 --> 3888.90]  But, um, I mean, this is Tim's interest.
[3888.90 --> 3889.90]  It's interesting too.
[3889.90 --> 3893.90]  Like Tim has some, some, um, music he listens to.
[3893.90 --> 3897.90]  And it's, um, singers that talk about our defense of things.
[3897.90 --> 3906.90]  Like why do we have to, um, like we didn't take part in all that stuff, but we live, you know, with the after effects of it, right.
[3906.90 --> 3913.90]  Um, and, um, some conversations need to be had, but some situations are so sensitive.
[3913.90 --> 3919.90]  So we need to really also use discernment in a lot of, um, like if you're ever approached kind of thing.
[3919.90 --> 3925.90]  But page 27 of this book we want to gift you guys with says, this is not an Aboriginal problem.
[3925.90 --> 3927.90]  This is a Canadian problem.
[3927.90 --> 3935.90]  Because at the same time, the Aboriginal people were being demeaned in schools and their culture and language were being taken away from them.
[3935.90 --> 3938.90]  And they were being told that they were inferior.
[3938.90 --> 3945.90]  They were pagans, that they were heathens and savages, and that they were unworthy of being respected.
[3945.90 --> 3953.90]  That very same message was being given to the non-Aboriginal children in public schools as well.
[3953.90 --> 3958.90]  They need to know that history includes them.
[3958.90 --> 3964.90]  And I noticed that over the years, a lot of what Tim and I do too is bringing them into community.
[3964.90 --> 3968.90]  Um, they're just on the reserve and we bring them into the community.
[3968.90 --> 3971.90]  And we say, well, this is for you.
[3971.90 --> 3978.90]  This, you know, I hope that you can, you know, feel comfortable and be comfortable in these surroundings and in these situations.
[3978.90 --> 3986.90]  And we're really just trying to prepare the youth and, and show them, yeah, how to be more involved in community.
[3986.90 --> 3989.90]  And then one other thing, but I think I just lost it.
[3989.90 --> 3991.90]  Sorry, you guys.
[3991.90 --> 3995.90]  I'll probably come up in conversation later on down the road.
[3995.90 --> 3996.90]  Thank you.
[3996.90 --> 4007.90]  Uh, and Tim, for you, you mentioned, um, having to name, uh, previous in encounters with Christianity or with Christian mission as imposters.
[4007.90 --> 4013.90]  Um, and I wonder, uh, gonna get you to reflect on a quote.
[4013.90 --> 4015.90]  Uh, this is a quote from Leslie Newbegin.
[4015.90 --> 4020.90]  Uh, Leslie Newbegin, uh, Leslie Newbegin was a missionary to India from England.
[4020.90 --> 4024.90]  Uh, and he wrote a book called The Gospel in a Pluralist Society.
[4024.90 --> 4030.90]  Uh, and he saw the impact of, uh, the wedding of colonization and Christianity there.
[4030.90 --> 4039.90]  And he says the following, uh, the Christian points to Jesus as the master clue in the common search of humanity for salvation and invites others to follow.
[4039.90 --> 4053.90]  It is true that this invitation, when it is given by Christians who are in positions of power and privilege, may be radically corrupted into a kind of spiritual imperialism, which is oppressive rather than liberating.
[4053.90 --> 4058.90]  Missions have been guilty of this distortion, and we have to acknowledge it.
[4058.90 --> 4064.90]  Now, as I share that quote with you, I want you to know that comes from the 1960s.
[4064.90 --> 4071.90]  That's not part of the so-called woke culture movement that we might, uh, liken that to today.
[4071.90 --> 4075.90]  Um, this is an important aspect of our conversation.
[4075.90 --> 4084.90]  And so I wonder if you can reflect on how you have seen the effect of that sort of radical corruption that Newbegin talks about in your work.
[4084.90 --> 4090.90]  And then how do you talk to indigenous men and women who have been victims of this imperialism?
[4090.90 --> 4110.90]  Um, yeah, no, uh, actually one of the things that I, I continually, uh, struggle, but, uh, to understand, I guess, is, is, so the people group that we work with, the Shwetmik people, uh, Shushwa people, is, is they are, uh, matriarchal.
[4110.90 --> 4116.90]  And there's a lot of matriarchal, um, uh, communities as well.
[4116.90 --> 4125.90]  And so it's like, so I'm like, I'm always trying to figure out, like, like growing up in the church, it's always like, be a man, be the leader of the household and whatnot.
[4125.90 --> 4137.90]  Um, but then all of a sudden, uh, you go into a First Nations context and it's like, you talk to most people and you, and you talk to them about their faith and their faith came from their grandma, their auntie, their mom.
[4137.90 --> 4140.90]  They're like, it was, it's very, it's very women led.
[4140.90 --> 4141.90]  So it's, it's interesting.
[4141.90 --> 4149.90]  Like I've, I've come in, like going into ministry, I was like, I'm going to get ahold of the men and we're going to, you know, kind of shape things around.
[4149.90 --> 4157.90]  And, uh, and, and then it was, it, it became very clear, like, it was like, nope, we're, we have to do things different and things are going to look different.
[4157.90 --> 4165.90]  And, uh, and so I think coming in it, into it from like a top down and like, uh, and like a, you need this, you need that.
[4165.90 --> 4170.90]  Uh, we've, we've lived in the community and we've been a family.
[4170.90 --> 4179.90]  Like, it's been cool to see how God has used our kids time and time again, uh, to where we've been a family and just, just operating as a family.
[4179.90 --> 4186.90]  In the community and the, the, the, the community seeing, well, cause my parents, my parents came before us as well.
[4186.90 --> 4190.90]  Uh, and, and they were in the community working, uh, for name.
[4190.90 --> 4193.90]  Um, and then it's kind of neat for them to see.
[4193.90 --> 4201.90]  So the same message that my parents were saying, this is the same message that we're saying, and which is the same message that our kids are living out.
[4201.90 --> 4206.90]  And they're seeing the healthy, the healthy dynamics of, of our family.
[4206.90 --> 4214.90]  And so that's where we're seeing a lot of transformation happen is, is people are more like, they're more inquisitive of like, there's something different.
[4214.90 --> 4217.90]  Like there's something different about you and you guys do things different.
[4217.90 --> 4225.90]  And how do you guys have hope in the time when, and, and that's what we usually find is it's, it's in those times of hopelessness and those times that, that are hard.
[4225.90 --> 4235.90]  And the times that are, you're stretched and you're pushed beyond your means, like, and it, and, and I've been telling people like we've been going from crisis to crisis, to crisis, to crisis.
[4235.90 --> 4239.90]  Like it's been like we had COVID then there were, or there was the COVID crisis.
[4239.90 --> 4242.90]  Then there was, uh, the heat stroke crisis.
[4242.90 --> 4246.90]  Then there was also finding the 215 out in Kamloops.
[4246.90 --> 4250.90]  And then there was also, then there's the fires and then the smoke.
[4250.90 --> 4253.90]  And, and so it's been like going from one thing to the next, to the next.
[4253.90 --> 4256.90]  And people are looking, they're like, where's your hope?
[4256.90 --> 4264.90]  That's when everybody's going to be looking for where your hope is, because it's not, it's not in the good times that you're going to sit there and you're going to be like, oh, everything's great and perfect.
[4264.90 --> 4265.90]  And you should trust in Jesus.
[4265.90 --> 4285.90]  And it's like, and a lot of times it's when they're burying their mother or they're burying their grandpa or they're, or they've lost a loved one or they've, you know, encountered some severe, uh, heartfelt, uh, trauma or, and, and you're, you're walking them, walking with them through that.
[4285.90 --> 4290.90]  It's, it's challenging, but at the same time, it's, uh, it's one of those things.
[4290.90 --> 4296.90]  I think it's, I think missions has done, done things incorrectly and poorly in the past.
[4296.90 --> 4300.90]  I would say some people have, but I think that's across the board.
[4300.90 --> 4312.90]  I think, I think it's always tricky to sit there and, and, uh, over generalize and say, because it, because at the same time, I think there was a lot of people in the past that have done an amazing job of just loving people into the kingdom.
[4312.90 --> 4319.90]  And I think that's, that's one of my biggest things is, is, uh, starting a conversation and just loving on people.
[4319.90 --> 4323.90]  Um, I think that's one of the big, the healthiest things that we can do.
[4323.90 --> 4335.90]  Um, and one of the things that came out was, um, like when they started searching for the, like doing these aerial searches, uh, at these residential schools was there's this like hashtag that came out.
[4335.90 --> 4338.90]  So that said, tax the churches to pay for the searches.
[4338.90 --> 4341.90]  And I was like, I was like, that sucks.
[4341.90 --> 4351.90]  Like, I was like, I was like, I don't think like, I, I, whereas I think it would have been a cooler option to all of a sudden have all the churches be like to, to get this information.
[4351.90 --> 4355.90]  And as a church body to be like, we want to pay for that.
[4355.90 --> 4356.90]  You know what I mean?
[4356.90 --> 4364.90]  Not, not an obligation, not like, uh, Hey, this is coming out of your, your, your bank, but more like, uh, Hey, like we care about you guys.
[4364.90 --> 4365.90]  We want to pay for that.
[4365.90 --> 4366.90]  We want to help you guys out with that.
[4366.90 --> 4368.90]  We want to reach out.
[4368.90 --> 4374.90]  And so it's, it's, it's little acts of love like that, where you can just be like looking for opportunities.
[4374.90 --> 4385.90]  But honestly, the biggest thing is just having that open ear and just listening and, uh, having that respect of, of, uh, of hearing, hearing somebody, hearing somebody out.
[4385.90 --> 4387.90]  Did you want to add to that as well?
[4387.90 --> 4388.90]  Or?
[4388.90 --> 4390.90]  Oh, well, it's interesting.
[4390.90 --> 4397.90]  The quote comes from the 1960s and I'll keep it PG, but there was a 1960s scoop, um, during that time too.
[4397.90 --> 4409.90]  And what you gotta realize is, um, since the 18, 19 hundreds early, um, lot of people are in survival mode.
[4409.90 --> 4426.90]  I'm, you know, um, survival mode, um, is happening, but we want people to really take, um, advantage or we want people to, um, help me with the words, but, um, ownership of their spiritual walk, their spirituality.
[4426.90 --> 4427.90]  We really want them.
[4427.90 --> 4436.90]  And so if, um, the way missions was done in the past too, sometimes it could be done, I guess, in a little bit of a paternalistic way and, um, teaching them your way, your way, your way.
[4436.90 --> 4445.90]  And, um, I mean, I feel like when we first got started and stepped foot on the reserve, wow, I was like, they just taught me.
[4445.90 --> 4449.90]  They just brought, they just brought us in and they just taught us so much.
[4449.90 --> 4458.90]  And, um, and things can be done different and we can all worship and praise God and, and live for him in our own cultural way.
[4458.90 --> 4459.90]  And it was amazing.
[4459.90 --> 4460.90]  And it's just amazing.
[4460.90 --> 4466.90]  Um, the differences and the variety that, I mean, just God is, um, just so creative.
[4466.90 --> 4474.90]  So, um, but with that, uh, survival mode all the time too, um, we have to be really sensitive coming in as.
[4474.90 --> 4475.90]  Yeah.
[4475.90 --> 4485.90]  No, and I think for many of us, it's hard to understand, uh, what it means to intergenerationally exist in survival mode.
[4485.90 --> 4488.90]  I think that's a hard reality for many of us to recognize.
[4488.90 --> 4494.90]  Um, I'm going to follow up just a second because, uh, Tim, you keep segueing nicely to where I want this conversation to go.
[4494.90 --> 4495.90]  So thank you for that.
[4495.90 --> 4499.90]  Um, Newbegin follows up in the, from that quote.
[4499.90 --> 4505.90]  And he says that the Christian gospel has sometimes been made a tool of imperialism and of that we have to repent.
[4505.90 --> 4509.90]  But at its heart, it is the denial of all imperialisms.
[4509.90 --> 4520.90]  For at its center, there is a cross where all imperialisms are humbled and we are invited to find the center of human unity in the one who was made nothing so that all might be made one.
[4520.90 --> 4528.90]  The very heart of the biblical vision for the unity of humankind is that its center is not an imperial power, but the slain lamb.
[4529.90 --> 4530.90]  Amen.
[4531.90 --> 4532.90]  Amen.
[4532.90 --> 4541.90]  And, and so how is Jesus and the Christian gospel, uh, the answer that indigenous people, that all people need?
[4544.90 --> 4551.90]  And that's, and I think that's been the biggest thing that, um, like I said, we've, we've just tried to live it out.
[4551.90 --> 4556.90]  Um, I think, I think that's been, uh, cause we're like, you need to experience it.
[4556.90 --> 4561.90]  Like you need to, it needs to come from the spirit and the spirit needs to lead that person into that.
[4561.90 --> 4562.90]  Um, and it was funny.
[4562.90 --> 4570.90]  I was just talking to charity the other day and I was like, I'm so glad I'm a Calvinist in the sense that I'm like, I'm like, it's not up to me.
[4570.90 --> 4573.90]  Like, it's not up to me to drag somebody into faith.
[4573.90 --> 4580.90]  Uh, like I can show them like, and, and my, my one buddy put it as he's like, he's like, I'm like a waiter.
[4580.90 --> 4584.90]  He's like, he's like, I, I just, I bring the food.
[4584.90 --> 4589.90]  He's like, if you have a problem with the food, he's like, talk to the, talk to the chef, talk, go to the kitchen.
[4589.90 --> 4591.90]  And I was like, it's so true.
[4591.90 --> 4595.90]  Like, and, and so I was like, that's my job is I'm, I'm the waiter.
[4595.90 --> 4599.90]  I bring the food and, and it's up to you whether you want to eat it.
[4599.90 --> 4606.90]  It's up to you whether you want to complain about it or push it away or, um, but that's, that's, that's been our big thing.
[4606.90 --> 4621.90]  Um, is yeah, just not trying to push things, not trying to force it down anybody's throat, but just kind of, uh, presenting it through our, through our own lives and through, through our everyday, uh, I guess goings on.
[4621.90 --> 4627.90]  Oh, are you also glad you're a Calvinist?
[4627.90 --> 4634.90]  Just, I had coffee this morning and my train of thought is all over the place.
[4634.90 --> 4636.90]  Sometimes I should drink decaf.
[4636.90 --> 4637.90]  Okay.
[4637.90 --> 4649.90]  Um, but, um, we have really interesting conversations in the fellowship and we have to hash things out from their viewpoint and perspective.
[4649.90 --> 4656.90]  And we have to hash and, and then we have to present the gospel and it's full truth and it is black and white.
[4656.90 --> 4661.90]  Um, but when at the core of all of it, we want the same thing.
[4661.90 --> 4663.90]  That's the core of it.
[4663.90 --> 4676.90]  And the misrepresentation of, of God, church, the whole picture of it from residential school background, it's not pretty.
[4676.90 --> 4679.90]  It's really, really, really messy.
[4679.90 --> 4691.90]  And to just present the clear truth, our, the, our chief even was like, I want this for our people and I want our, our people to see it like this.
[4691.90 --> 4695.90]  Um, and, uh, that was just recently just said too.
[4695.90 --> 4705.90]  And, um, a hard part for me is when we are at, we are at some gatherings and there is that hurt and that pain.
[4705.90 --> 4707.90]  And that pain that's projected out.
[4707.90 --> 4708.90]  They do.
[4708.90 --> 4711.90]  There are some instances where the church is bashed.
[4711.90 --> 4714.90]  That's the body that's bashing the body of Christ.
[4714.90 --> 4719.90]  And we have a job too, as representatives to say, okay, wait, hold on a second.
[4719.90 --> 4724.90]  We need to have a conversation because I represent that body of Christ.
[4724.90 --> 4729.90]  And I don't think Jesus wants us talking badly about his bride.
[4729.90 --> 4732.90]  I was going to say, I just had, had another thought.
[4732.90 --> 4736.90]  Um, this is, and it was kind of interesting with that quote.
[4736.90 --> 4742.90]  It, it really, it, it exemplifies kind of what I guess my biggest beef is.
[4742.90 --> 4745.90]  Um, because man, like the, the community is amazing.
[4745.90 --> 4747.90]  Like the culture is phenomenal.
[4747.90 --> 4755.90]  Um, the amount of like, they, they integrate prayer into, into everything that they do.
[4755.90 --> 4759.90]  And I'm like, I'm like, oh man, we could like our culture could learn from this.
[4759.90 --> 4762.90]  Like, uh, but, but I'm like that.
[4762.90 --> 4765.90]  And that's always been the biggest thing is the one missing piece is Jesus.
[4765.90 --> 4768.90]  And Jesus is such a massive piece.
[4768.90 --> 4776.90]  Um, because there, you talk to any, any kid or any person on the reserve and you ask them about ghosts.
[4776.90 --> 4784.90]  And then they're like, you, you, you, any, any kid will give you a handful of stories right off the top of their head of what's going on even inside of their house.
[4784.90 --> 4788.90]  Um, so they're very spiritually aware, which is amazing.
[4788.90 --> 4794.90]  Um, but instead of going to Jesus with that, instead of going to the ultimate power with that,
[4794.90 --> 4802.90]  they're like, they call the medicine men or they call, or they get somebody to clean out the house, uh, with tobacco and sage and, and rose water.
[4802.90 --> 4805.90]  And so it's like, you need all these different things.
[4805.90 --> 4816.90]  And it, and it reminded me very much of like the Pharisee sort of a situation where it's like, you have to go through these certain ceremonies in order to, to get this, this purification.
[4816.90 --> 4818.90]  Whereas I'm like, man, it's a free gift.
[4818.90 --> 4820.90]  It's a free gift and it's right here.
[4820.90 --> 4822.90]  And all you have to do is just accept it.
[4822.90 --> 4823.90]  Like, that's it.
[4823.90 --> 4832.90]  Um, and so that's been, yeah, I find, I find a lot of times there's the, the leaning on the ancestors.
[4832.90 --> 4841.90]  So the people that died before us, like our, our, our ancestors, uh, to, to kind of lead us and guide us and take us along the way.
[4841.90 --> 4847.90]  And I'm like, yeah, but, and I've had these conversations with some of the medicine men, uh, and spiritual people in the community.
[4847.90 --> 4855.90]  And I'm like, what if they're not, what if they don't know the way I was like, what if they, I was like, what if they're bad ancestors?
[4855.90 --> 4859.90]  I was like, everybody's had a bad, like a, that weird uncle, like that weird.
[4859.90 --> 4860.90]  Like that weird.
[4860.90 --> 4868.90]  And so, and so I'm like, I'm like, there's, there's all those, like, and so we've had those conversations and it's, and it's, uh, it's been interesting.
[4868.90 --> 4872.90]  Like that, and, and that, that's what I've always tried to do is just, just ask questions.
[4872.90 --> 4878.90]  Like we always try to ask questions and just try to, try to, try to understand more.
[4878.90 --> 4890.90]  And, uh, but yeah, I think that's, that's the biggest piece for me is, is man, like there's just so much freedom through Christ that we, that we experience that, uh, that can be so healing.
[4890.90 --> 4899.90]  And, and it's amazing when you see somebody who has had intergenerational trauma and then they can come to Christ, like the amount of us switch over.
[4899.90 --> 4908.90]  And I'm not saying that it's always going to be like an immediate switch over and everything's peachy and there's rainbows and sunshine and everything.
[4908.90 --> 4913.90]  Uh, but there's, there's so many, so many people where it's like, it's just a night and day switch.
[4913.90 --> 4915.90]  It's just a total, total transformation.
[4915.90 --> 4917.90]  And it's, it's amazing to see.
[4917.90 --> 4920.90]  Amen.
[4920.90 --> 4924.90]  There's so many more questions I want to ask you and conversations we want to get into.
[4924.90 --> 4931.90]  I'm going to just, again, they're going to be in the back following our time here this morning and you can follow up with them some more.
[4931.90 --> 4938.90]  Uh, one last thing and, um, Tim quickly, you suffer the same disease I do.
[4938.90 --> 4946.90]  So what are some, uh, resources or suggested learning you can provide for us or suggest to us as we go forward?
[4946.90 --> 4954.90]  We have like a really good, actually, we have a, uh, we were going to do a bunch of printouts of it, but there's a bunch of different web links.
[4954.90 --> 4959.90]  But what we can do is, um, we actually have, uh, some prayer cards.
[4959.90 --> 4960.90]  They're like updated.
[4960.90 --> 4963.90]  So it actually looks like us, not like us, like 20 years ago.
[4963.90 --> 4969.90]  Um, but, uh, and, and on it, it has our email address.
[4969.90 --> 4978.90]  Um, so if you guys want some more resources, we can easily, like, just send us a quick little email and we'll just email you all these different web links.
[4978.90 --> 4982.90]  Um, and, and it's some really good stuff.
[4982.90 --> 4983.90]  What's that?
[4983.90 --> 4986.90]  And if you have Netflix, you can watch Indian horse.
[4986.90 --> 4987.90]  Yeah.
[4987.90 --> 4998.90]  And then we're gonna, we're gonna, this is a, it's not a Christian author, but still really good, really good, uh, uh, stuff from a, a First Nations point of view.
[4998.90 --> 5011.90]  Um, and so we're gonna gift this one to you guys for your library, so that way hopefully if you guys are ever, like, just kind of, uh, it's a really easy read, but at the same time it also tackles some really, really hard topics.
[5011.90 --> 5020.90]  Uh, and it just kind of gets you, gets you thinking of, uh, some, some ways of kind of, uh, opening up and, and, uh, looking for ways to, to plug in.
[5020.90 --> 5027.90]  So, yeah, I'd, I'd say the biggest, easiest way is just to email us and then we can send you some more, more information for sure.
[5027.90 --> 5028.90]  Excellent.
[5028.90 --> 5029.90]  Thank you.
[5029.90 --> 5031.90]  Uh, Amanda, do you hear that?
[5031.90 --> 5032.90]  They're giving a book to the library.
[5032.90 --> 5037.90]  So, quickly put the church stamp in it so that everybody here can run and wrestle for who gets it first.
[5037.90 --> 5045.90]  Tim and Charity, uh, and your kids who are back there, I want to thank you all so much for joining with us, uh, and for sharing your story.
[5045.90 --> 5048.90]  Can we thank them together, just with a quick round of applause?
[5048.90 --> 5050.90]  Thank you guys.
[5050.90 --> 5056.90]  I'm gonna finish just by praying for you and for the work of name.
[5056.90 --> 5057.90]  And for the work of name.
[5057.90 --> 5059.90]  Let's bow our heads in prayer together.
[5059.90 --> 5079.90]  Heavenly Father, as we sit, uh, in circle together in these hard conversations, we thank you first for your grace and for your mercy, which has made us new.
[5079.90 --> 5091.90]  We thank you for the, the testimonies of being made new and of, uh, seeing that happen in people's lives.
[5091.90 --> 5101.90]  God, even though we are no longer slaves to sin or to a past, we know that we are impacted by that past.
[5101.90 --> 5110.90]  We may not be defined by it, and yet it still influences how we see the world or how we interact with others.
[5110.90 --> 5122.90]  And so we want to pray, Lord God, that by the power of your spirit, you would, uh, not only, uh, show to us that we have been made new, but also, Lord God, make us new.
[5122.90 --> 5127.90]  Help us to be that new creation in our life together.
[5127.90 --> 5136.90]  Lord, I want to thank you for Tim and for charity and for their family and the work that they do in the, the Shuswap community.
[5136.90 --> 5147.90]  Uh, I pray, Lord God, for the relationships that they have with, uh, the First Nations people and the, uh, chiefs and the other families and the young people.
[5147.90 --> 5158.70]  I pray for the, uh, the life that they live on the ground in the mess and the, uh, sometimes hell of trauma with them.
[5159.90 --> 5163.94]  I pray, Lord God, that you would strengthen their work, strengthen their hearts.
[5164.42 --> 5170.98]  May they also be captivated by your gospel and by you, Lord Jesus, and the beauty of what you have in store.
[5172.74 --> 5175.26]  And may they be refreshed and renewed in that.
[5177.90 --> 5180.84]  God, we pray for their work and for the work of name.
[5181.00 --> 5185.48]  And we pray for all missionaries who are serving you locally and globally.
[5187.14 --> 5190.44]  Empower that ministry.
