[1769.52 --> 1799.52]  Thank you.
[1799.52 --> 1829.50]  Thank you.
[1829.52 --> 1859.50]  Thank you.
[1859.52 --> 1889.50]  Thank you.
[1889.52 --> 1919.50]  There is a life.
[1919.52 --> 1949.50]  Thank you.
[1949.50 --> 1979.48]  Thank you.
[1979.50 --> 2009.48]  Thank you.
[2009.50 --> 2039.50]  Thank you.
[2039.50 --> 2069.48]  Thank you.
[2069.48 --> 2099.46]  Hi.
[2099.46 --> 2129.44]  Thank you.
[2129.44 --> 2159.42]  Thank you.
[2159.42 --> 2189.40]  Thank you.
[2189.40 --> 2219.38]  Have you.
[2219.38 --> 2249.36]  Thank you.
[2249.36 --> 2279.34]  Thank you.
[2279.36 --> 2309.34]  Yeah, it's hard.
[2309.34 --> 2339.32]  Yeah, I think you're listening.
[2339.32 --> 2369.30]  Thank you.
[2369.32 --> 2371.32]  Say bye to you.
[2399.32 --> 2429.30]  Thank you.
[2429.32 --> 2459.30]  So, the status of the house.
[2459.30 --> 2489.28]  And I'm going to say,
[2489.30 --> 2519.28]  Father, I'm going to say,
[2519.30 --> 2549.28]  on the day, I'm going to say,
[2549.28 --> 2579.28]  and I'm going to say,
[2579.28 --> 2609.26]  and I'm going to say,
[2609.26 --> 2639.26]  and I'm going to say,
[2639.26 --> 2669.24]  and I'm going to say,
[2669.26 --> 2671.26]  and I'm going to say, and I'm going to say,
[2699.26 --> 2701.26]  Lord, this, I'm going to say,
[2729.26 --> 2759.26]  and I'm going to say,
[2759.26 --> 2761.26]  and I'm going to say,
[2789.84 --> 2791.26]  and enable us.
[2791.26 --> 2802.28]  As we leave this place this morning and begin a new week, we ask that we may reflect the love of Christ to all whom we encounter. In Jesus' name, amen.
[2802.28 --> 2803.28]  Amen.
[2820.38 --> 2828.96]  You've been with us for the last number of months in our preaching and teaching here.
[2828.96 --> 2833.48]  We've been working through the book of 1 Peter, and with that we've provided this.
[2833.68 --> 2841.82]  And so there's a number of groups and Bible studies, care groups, and the like who have been working and walking through 1 Peter with us, with this book.
[2842.36 --> 2850.84]  Now that we are finished here, this is the last Sunday, if you want to continue your learning and you haven't picked up one of these, we do have more copies available.
[2850.84 --> 2860.86]  And so please talk to the office or grab me after church and I can get you one and you can dig deeper into this material.
[2862.68 --> 2868.60]  As I mentioned, as Glenn prayed, we are finishing the chapter today.
[2868.70 --> 2871.00]  And so we're going to read from 1 Peter 5.
[2871.52 --> 2877.94]  We're going to start at verse 8 and then read through to the end of the book at the end of verse 14.
[2877.94 --> 2883.14]  And so if you've got a Bible, I encourage you to open that up, of course, to have that in your hands in front of you.
[2883.96 --> 2887.54]  And it will also be on the screen behind me.
[2888.80 --> 2892.74]  And so 1 Peter 5, verse 8.
[2894.78 --> 2898.08]  Be alert and of sober mind.
[2899.08 --> 2905.76]  Your enemy, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.
[2905.76 --> 2908.24]  Resist him.
[2909.04 --> 2916.76]  Stand firm in the faith because you know that the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings.
[2917.76 --> 2925.98]  And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while,
[2926.12 --> 2931.80]  will himself restore you and make you strong, firm, and steadfast.
[2931.80 --> 2935.86]  To him be the power forever and ever.
[2936.52 --> 2936.92]  Amen.
[2938.36 --> 2944.18]  With the help of Silas, whom I regard as a faithful brother, I have written to you briefly,
[2944.86 --> 2949.76]  encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God.
[2950.22 --> 2952.14]  Stand fast in it.
[2952.14 --> 2962.54]  She who is in Babylon, that is Rome, chosen together with you, sends her greetings, and so does my son Mark.
[2963.34 --> 2965.62]  Greet one another with a kiss of love.
[2966.56 --> 2970.02]  Peace to all of you who are in Christ.
[2970.64 --> 2972.00]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2972.00 --> 2988.30]  Throughout this letter, we have been hearing Peter's call to wage war against sinful desires.
[2988.66 --> 2993.42]  To no longer give into or to conform to evil desires.
[2993.62 --> 2997.90]  To not do what pagans choose to do.
[2997.90 --> 3003.78]  But instead, Peter has said, be holy because God is holy.
[3004.12 --> 3009.52]  Instead, Peter has said to live such good lives among the pagans that though they accuse you of doing wrong,
[3009.58 --> 3012.18]  they might see your good deeds and glorify God.
[3012.76 --> 3020.66]  Instead, Peter has said, if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God that you bear that name.
[3020.66 --> 3032.72]  And now, as a final charge, Peter pulls all that together into what is really one long sentence in Greek.
[3032.82 --> 3038.36]  At least verse 8 and 9 is one long sentence in Greek.
[3038.80 --> 3042.76]  In our English translation, it's two, sometimes three, depending on which one you read.
[3043.46 --> 3046.18]  But that will be our sort of banner, our focus.
[3046.18 --> 3047.80]  Peter says,
[3047.80 --> 3054.22]  Your enemy, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour, and so resist him.
[3054.66 --> 3061.76]  Stand firm in the faith, knowing that the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings.
[3063.18 --> 3066.82]  Your enemy's prowling around you, looking to devour you.
[3067.16 --> 3072.00]  Instead, resist him, stand firm, knowing that you don't stand alone.
[3072.00 --> 3076.08]  Your enemy prowls around looking to devour you.
[3076.60 --> 3081.40]  Resist him, stand firm, knowing that you don't stand alone.
[3083.16 --> 3087.18]  Your enemy prowls around looking to devour you.
[3087.46 --> 3091.96]  Now, it's into that context that I want you to hear what I'm going to say next.
[3091.96 --> 3104.48]  And it is part of what Peter is trying to teach his readers and hearers, many of whom once lived as part of the pagan world that they're now called out of.
[3105.14 --> 3105.64]  Right?
[3105.70 --> 3107.48]  Now called out of as exiles.
[3108.70 --> 3112.60]  What used to be normal for them no longer can be.
[3114.90 --> 3116.38]  Here's what Peter wants you to hear.
[3116.38 --> 3122.28]  The culture that you live in is not neutral.
[3123.78 --> 3123.88]  Right?
[3124.02 --> 3128.14]  Culture isn't ideologically neutral or morally neutral.
[3128.40 --> 3134.66]  And I suspect that most of us today realize that that is true, at least to a certain extent or to a certain degree.
[3134.98 --> 3135.16]  Right?
[3135.20 --> 3143.78]  We realize that there are things and voices and forces that are pulling us and our minds and our hearts in particular directions.
[3143.78 --> 3148.10]  But it wasn't always the case that we realize that.
[3148.70 --> 3148.82]  Right?
[3148.86 --> 3164.36]  In the 20th century, so, you know, 21 years ago, there was this idea, this cultural idea that secularism, and what I mean by that is a worldview that's not necessarily rooted in theism or in a belief in God,
[3164.36 --> 3179.96]  but a worldview that is rooted in what you would call materialistic humanism, which is the idea that the physical world is all that there is and that people in it are fundamentally good and that history generally is moving towards increasing the good of people.
[3180.96 --> 3181.06]  Right?
[3181.10 --> 3188.26]  There was this idea that secularism, and that was socially accepted, that secularism was neutral.
[3188.26 --> 3198.16]  And that secular, the secular cultural movements were the only ones that were genuinely tolerant because of that neutrality.
[3199.54 --> 3204.66]  Now, like I said, this way of thinking isn't absolutely gone from our world because, to be honest, and we can talk about this more,
[3204.76 --> 3209.34]  but the recent secularism bill in Quebec kind of shows that it still is ongoing.
[3209.34 --> 3211.62]  But it has changed a little bit.
[3212.76 --> 3228.10]  And my point in bringing all of this up for us is that 2,000 years after Peter writes this letter, it's easy for us to see how the pagan culture that the Christians lived in at the time was in opposition to our shared faith.
[3228.20 --> 3236.52]  It's easy for us to see, from our perspectives, how their culture isn't neutral and how it was the devil prowling around like a roaring lion.
[3236.52 --> 3246.24]  It's easy to see 2,000 years removed how Christians shouldn't continue the cultural ideas about sex that existed in the Roman Empire.
[3246.64 --> 3253.08]  It's easy to see, 2,000 years later, how Christians shouldn't sacrifice to the emperor or offer worship to him,
[3253.30 --> 3258.66]  which was a test used by those persecuting the church to identify Christians.
[3258.66 --> 3265.42]  And while it's easy for us to see, from our perspective, as Christians 2,000 years later,
[3265.70 --> 3272.78]  it wouldn't have been so easy for those people living it, for the people in that moment.
[3275.22 --> 3282.90]  Sex with slaves and prostitutes, young, old, male, female, was just normal for most men in the Roman Empire,
[3285.04 --> 3288.24]  especially those who had some status and influence.
[3288.66 --> 3290.66]  It was just everyday part of life.
[3291.82 --> 3294.10]  I was thinking about an analogy.
[3295.14 --> 3303.12]  When I was a kid, it was absolutely, utterly normal, mundane, for when we went over to my grandpa's house
[3303.12 --> 3305.86]  or when he would come home, he would open the door and he would say,
[3305.96 --> 3309.62]  take off your hats, because there's no hats in the house.
[3311.48 --> 3313.32]  It was just normal for him to say that.
[3313.32 --> 3318.94]  Exactly as normal as that was, it was to sacrifice to the emperor.
[3319.76 --> 3324.96]  So you walked into a new city or you walked into someone's house and the pater familius,
[3325.12 --> 3329.68]  the leader of the family, would sacrifice to the emperor and he would turn to his kids or his grandkids and say,
[3330.48 --> 3332.06]  now sacrifice to the emperor.
[3332.06 --> 3334.18]  That's what you do.
[3334.90 --> 3341.02]  And in that culture, in that moment, it seems normal, it seems inane even, and it seems relatively harmless,
[3341.72 --> 3344.56]  but culture is not neutral.
[3345.86 --> 3348.34]  Now, to be sure, it's not all bad.
[3348.34 --> 3349.34]  Right?
[3350.38 --> 3354.42]  There are some good and great and awesome things that come out of culture.
[3354.70 --> 3360.02]  God gave us a cultural mandate that is to pursue and develop in the world.
[3361.18 --> 3371.10]  But I think it's easy to forget that your enemy, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.
[3371.10 --> 3375.02]  Because behind the culture is a force.
[3375.20 --> 3380.78]  Behind the culture is an idea, an enemy, waging war for your soul.
[3381.74 --> 3383.60]  Culture is not neutral.
[3385.66 --> 3391.82]  The Apostle Paul makes this same kind of point, pulling back the veil for us in Ephesians 6.
[3391.94 --> 3392.26]  He says,
[3392.26 --> 3421.28]  And realizing then what Peter and Paul are saying about the culture of their day,
[3421.28 --> 3422.72]  begs the question.
[3424.32 --> 3424.46]  Right?
[3424.52 --> 3432.12]  If culture isn't neutral, if culture, if what was normal or inane or seemingly harmless in that culture
[3432.12 --> 3435.20]  needed to be challenged, needed to be reimagined,
[3435.46 --> 3438.42]  the kinds of things that people would do without a second thought,
[3439.74 --> 3446.00]  what is it in our culture that is the same?
[3446.48 --> 3446.60]  Right?
[3446.60 --> 3450.08]  What is our food sacrificed to idols?
[3450.20 --> 3451.20]  Which is another one of those things.
[3451.28 --> 3453.56]  What is our worshipping of the emperor?
[3453.68 --> 3457.80]  What is our laissez-faire attitudes towards sex and sexuality?
[3457.92 --> 3459.94]  Because you better believe that we have them.
[3461.02 --> 3461.14]  Right?
[3461.18 --> 3463.42]  That our culture isn't neutral.
[3464.16 --> 3466.48]  And it is pervasive.
[3466.92 --> 3471.32]  And because it is pervasive, that means there are blind spots that we have.
[3471.40 --> 3475.44]  There are ignorances that we live out of, both willful and learned,
[3475.44 --> 3477.88]  as well as adopted and assumed.
[3477.88 --> 3482.64]  And let me be really clear, because some of you are drawing this conclusion already.
[3482.64 --> 3485.98]  I am not talking about left or right politics.
[3485.98 --> 3492.50]  I am not talking about the subtle redefinitions of progressivism or the unbendingness of conservatism.
[3492.50 --> 3493.12]  I am not talking about the truth.
[3493.12 --> 3498.16]  I am not talking about advocating for socialism or for libertarianism or anything in between.
[3498.16 --> 3505.54]  What I am saying is culture isn't neutral.
[3505.54 --> 3513.08]  And culture is shaping you and forming you and pulling you in a particular direction.
[3513.42 --> 3514.94]  None of us live in a vacuum.
[3515.94 --> 3520.96]  The reality is, as long as you live in the world, as long as you live in society as social beings,
[3521.24 --> 3524.68]  you are being shaped and formed in a particular way.
[3524.68 --> 3528.46]  The question is, to what image?
[3529.64 --> 3530.58]  Whose image?
[3530.72 --> 3531.82]  To what end?
[3533.28 --> 3537.30]  And as God holds up to you the mirror of his word,
[3537.84 --> 3541.92]  do you see someone who looks exactly like the pagan culture around you?
[3541.98 --> 3545.68]  Or do you see someone who looks increasingly like Jesus?
[3545.82 --> 3550.18]  Or to put it another way, do you see compromise or do you see holiness?
[3550.18 --> 3556.04]  And let me be fair, because asking that question is unfair.
[3557.18 --> 3560.76]  Because if it's compromise, you won't actually see it.
[3561.52 --> 3562.94]  Because you're blind to it.
[3563.54 --> 3565.62]  Because that's just the way it is.
[3566.66 --> 3571.68]  The enemy is prowling around below the surface of the tall grass,
[3572.62 --> 3574.34]  looking to devour you.
[3575.14 --> 3577.36]  You just can't see it.
[3580.18 --> 3586.54]  Look, with both prophetic boldness and pastoral sensitivity,
[3586.80 --> 3589.12]  I'm going to be explicit with you.
[3590.52 --> 3597.92]  Some of you are trading the glories of Christ for the lesser glories of this world.
[3599.10 --> 3602.46]  Because you are still operating out of the worldview of the culture.
[3602.46 --> 3608.50]  And look, while I believe, and I know that everybody needs to hear this,
[3609.08 --> 3611.80]  this is especially true for those of you who are younger,
[3611.88 --> 3614.74]  for those of you who are teenagers or who are emerging adults right now.
[3614.74 --> 3618.06]  Because the world is telling you a particular thing.
[3618.16 --> 3620.22]  It's selling you a particular bill of goods.
[3620.50 --> 3622.84]  It's saying, follow what sparks joy.
[3623.16 --> 3624.12]  Follow your bliss.
[3624.52 --> 3625.90]  Do only what you love.
[3625.90 --> 3632.70]  We live in a time and place that has set up impossible standards and expectations for beauty.
[3633.10 --> 3636.88]  And we live in a time and place that demands Instagrammable moments
[3636.88 --> 3639.98]  in order to convey a certain quality of life.
[3640.34 --> 3643.98]  And really, in this mix, even the so-called counter-cultural
[3643.98 --> 3647.18]  is just another community of free-thinking, unique individuals
[3647.18 --> 3650.34]  who think exactly the same thing and who look exactly the same.
[3650.96 --> 3651.04]  Right?
[3651.18 --> 3653.54]  Uniqueness in today's world requires uniformity.
[3653.54 --> 3656.54]  Uniqueness in today's world.
[3656.54 --> 3662.26]  Some of you will go on living your life like all that matters is this life.
[3664.08 --> 3665.08]  This world.
[3665.84 --> 3667.76]  That all that matters is right now.
[3667.86 --> 3668.52]  That this is it.
[3669.54 --> 3672.26]  And I want you to hear what Peter has been telling us through this series.
[3673.24 --> 3675.16]  That is pagan.
[3675.16 --> 3687.80]  There is a whole culture of Christians right now who are actually more pagan than we are biblical.
[3689.62 --> 3692.98]  You are pagan if you live like this world is all there is.
[3693.92 --> 3698.80]  You are pagan if your approach to God is as a credit and debit system.
[3699.34 --> 3699.48]  Right?
[3699.52 --> 3701.44]  A ledger that God keeps track of.
[3701.50 --> 3703.52]  Or that, more accurately, you keep track of.
[3703.52 --> 3703.68]  Right?
[3703.70 --> 3705.74]  You say things like, okay, God, I did this.
[3705.94 --> 3707.06]  I was obedient in this.
[3707.12 --> 3708.04]  I was faithful in this.
[3708.16 --> 3709.36]  Now give me my reward.
[3710.78 --> 3710.94]  Right?
[3710.98 --> 3712.74]  God, I've been good all my life.
[3713.08 --> 3714.48]  Don't I deserve a little break?
[3716.76 --> 3718.08]  God, I have been faithful.
[3719.52 --> 3721.24]  Can't you give me a boyfriend?
[3721.24 --> 3725.82]  I have done everything you've asked of me.
[3727.12 --> 3728.04]  Can't you just give me this?
[3728.04 --> 3729.42]  God, I have done everything you've asked of me.
[3729.42 --> 3735.16]  The backbone of pagan Christianity is a consumerist approach to life.
[3735.46 --> 3738.26]  In that what matters is what you can get out of it.
[3738.32 --> 3740.18]  What matters is what I can get out of it.
[3743.10 --> 3744.90]  I've got no use for that person.
[3745.86 --> 3746.72]  Have you ever said that?
[3746.76 --> 3747.86]  Have you ever heard that expression?
[3749.18 --> 3749.38]  Right?
[3749.38 --> 3750.70]  I've got no use for that person.
[3751.04 --> 3753.38]  That's a consumerist approach to people.
[3753.38 --> 3756.32]  Making them a means to an end.
[3756.42 --> 3758.60]  Something to be used for your benefit.
[3758.90 --> 3760.58]  And we do the same thing with God.
[3761.28 --> 3762.26]  And with church.
[3762.98 --> 3763.52]  And worship.
[3764.26 --> 3764.76]  And prayer.
[3766.34 --> 3769.26]  If you've stopped doing any of those things.
[3769.34 --> 3770.10]  Interacting with God.
[3770.24 --> 3771.20]  Or worshiping Him.
[3771.50 --> 3772.66]  And praying to Him.
[3772.74 --> 3773.54]  And studying His Word.
[3773.60 --> 3775.40]  If you stopped doing any of those things.
[3776.16 --> 3778.30]  Because you don't get anything out of it.
[3779.30 --> 3780.70]  Many of us have heard that before.
[3780.84 --> 3781.60]  Or said that before.
[3781.60 --> 3783.56]  That's consumerism.
[3784.24 --> 3785.72]  That's pagan Christianity.
[3787.00 --> 3788.84]  And that's no Christianity at all.
[3790.36 --> 3793.82]  That's the danger of thinking that culture is neutral.
[3794.90 --> 3795.82]  It's not.
[3797.10 --> 3799.00]  Culture is investing in you.
[3799.00 --> 3802.46]  And it expects a return on its investment.
[3803.92 --> 3809.36]  Your enemy, the devil, is prowling around looking to devour you.
[3809.36 --> 3812.12]  Resist Him.
[3813.66 --> 3813.84]  Right?
[3813.90 --> 3819.30]  We need to stop letting the lesser glories of this world captivate our hearts and imaginations.
[3819.46 --> 3825.48]  Instead, we need to turn our hearts to the magnificence and the beauty of Jesus and the Gospel.
[3825.48 --> 3839.92]  The way that you resist lesser glories in life and in this world is by opening your eyes and your heart to the greater glory of God in the Gospel.
[3839.92 --> 3843.30]  And to do that over and over and over again.
[3843.30 --> 3857.92]  What would our church look like if our imaginations, if our social imaginaries, if the lens through which we looked at the entire world,
[3858.16 --> 3864.70]  what would this church look like if we were captivated utterly and completely by the glory of God?
[3865.04 --> 3866.56]  What would your life look like?
[3867.34 --> 3870.30]  What is one thing right now that would be different?
[3870.30 --> 3873.86]  I've been praying through this question this week.
[3874.24 --> 3877.66]  And let me tell you what I believe the Lord has given me to see.
[3877.86 --> 3879.80]  Because this is the resistance.
[3881.98 --> 3890.12]  I see a church full of people who can't help declare the glories of God in the Gospel to their neighbors.
[3890.12 --> 3900.58]  I look out and I see new faces each week because more and more people are falling in love with Jesus and with His church, longing to be part of something here.
[3901.50 --> 3908.24]  I see a group of people who want that here in this place so that they're willing to take it anywhere.
[3908.24 --> 3918.66]  But I see a new generation, young and old, sacrificing the comforts and the safety of a consumerist paganism for the glory of God in global mission.
[3918.66 --> 3930.40]  I see medical professionals, doctors and nurses going with Medicine Sans Frontier or the Luke Society to be healing and to bring wholeness to communities around the world.
[3930.40 --> 3938.02]  I see civil engineers committed to ending homelessness and providing affordable, integrated social housing.
[3938.76 --> 3948.10]  I see a church family willingly, joyfully backing impossible efforts for the Gospel with prayer and with resources.
[3948.10 --> 3958.56]  And then not just in the big things, right, because I see husbands and wives fighting for their marriages even after huge mistakes, even when the culture is saying, just leave.
[3959.20 --> 3963.58]  Because the Gospel of Jesus teaches reconciliation and restoration.
[3964.52 --> 3972.06]  I see kids looking at their parents and being inspired to worship God and live for His glory with purpose and passion.
[3972.06 --> 3981.28]  I see brothers being reconciled and relationships being made whole because both parties are willingly choosing humility and the attitude of Jesus.
[3981.72 --> 3986.12]  I see sisters stop gossiping but instead supporting and encouraging one another.
[3986.40 --> 3988.56]  I see widows held up in their grief.
[3988.96 --> 3993.34]  I see other people's kids being adopted by spiritual parents and spiritual grandparents.
[3993.34 --> 4002.30]  And I see all of this and so much more because I'm looking for the glory of God in you, in here, with us.
[4003.00 --> 4006.24]  Let's not settle for lesser glories or pagan substitutes.
[4006.66 --> 4007.44]  Resist them.
[4009.28 --> 4015.80]  I believe that's what Peter means when he says, resist him, stand firm in the faith.
[4016.52 --> 4021.50]  Don't be pulled away to be devoured by the devil through a culture that isn't ever neutral.
[4021.50 --> 4033.16]  You see, just as exposure and participation in the culture in paganism shapes you, forms you over time,
[4033.58 --> 4038.26]  so too does exposure and participation in the faith.
[4039.12 --> 4041.50]  Stand firm in the faith.
[4042.22 --> 4044.46]  Your enemy prowls around looking to devour you.
[4044.56 --> 4047.56]  Instead, resist him and now stand firm.
[4047.56 --> 4056.20]  Instead, be shaped and formed and transformed by the renewing of your mind.
[4056.40 --> 4060.22]  This is what Paul says, again, and I think recognizing the exact same thing that Peter does,
[4060.26 --> 4062.78]  that we have here in this text and throughout the whole letter.
[4062.88 --> 4064.08]  Paul says in Romans 12,
[4064.08 --> 4083.60]  The way that you resist the devil, the way that you counterform against a pagan culture,
[4083.60 --> 4089.58]  is by the regular, habitual, ritual practices of what it means to be Christians.
[4089.58 --> 4094.54]  So then, just as you have received Christ Jesus as Lord,
[4094.92 --> 4099.22]  continue to live your lives in him, rooted and built up in him,
[4099.48 --> 4102.20]  strengthened in the faith as you were taught.
[4103.70 --> 4107.52]  Stand firm by being rooted and built up.
[4108.04 --> 4110.68]  Stand firm by being strengthened in the faith.
[4110.86 --> 4114.38]  Stand firm by growing in the grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[4114.38 --> 4120.52]  Stand firm so that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy,
[4120.52 --> 4125.08]  which depends on human tradition and the elemental spiritual forces of this world,
[4125.18 --> 4127.32]  rather than on Christ.
[4128.22 --> 4134.46]  The practices of the faith, the habitual, ritual practices of faith for you,
[4134.58 --> 4138.34]  they transform you into the image of Jesus.
[4139.84 --> 4140.42]  Look at it.
[4140.98 --> 4142.98]  Look at it this way, because some of you might say,
[4142.98 --> 4145.38]  in fact, people have said to me,
[4145.98 --> 4147.88]  I'm just not a patient person.
[4148.70 --> 4150.36]  I've never been a patient person.
[4151.86 --> 4154.08]  And as true as that might be for you right now,
[4154.42 --> 4157.40]  what would happen if you spent the next year
[4157.40 --> 4160.92]  actually, genuinely, daily,
[4161.84 --> 4163.46]  praying for patience?
[4164.82 --> 4167.50]  Not only do I believe that God has the power
[4167.50 --> 4170.94]  to supernaturally transform your heart and mind,
[4170.94 --> 4173.08]  making you more patient in response to his prayer,
[4173.50 --> 4179.04]  but I also know that just the habitual practice of centering on Jesus
[4179.04 --> 4181.24]  and meditating on your need for patience in him,
[4181.44 --> 4184.10]  just the habitual practice of constantly putting that
[4184.10 --> 4186.28]  before the throne of grace in prayer,
[4186.50 --> 4187.84]  will make you more patient.
[4187.84 --> 4190.54]  And sure, not at first,
[4191.22 --> 4192.18]  not right away,
[4193.18 --> 4195.68]  but slowly and deeply,
[4196.10 --> 4197.88]  from the inside out,
[4197.92 --> 4199.58]  as your mind is renewed,
[4199.72 --> 4201.80]  and as you learn over that time
[4201.80 --> 4203.62]  what makes you lose your patience,
[4204.12 --> 4206.28]  as you reflect on why you're impatient.
[4206.74 --> 4207.32]  And I mean here,
[4207.38 --> 4208.54]  the actual why,
[4208.80 --> 4209.50]  not just the,
[4209.70 --> 4211.54]  my kids know how to push my buttons why,
[4211.68 --> 4212.88]  but the heart reason why.
[4212.88 --> 4217.04]  A couple fathers just looked at their sons.
[4219.78 --> 4220.78]  If the son heard,
[4220.90 --> 4222.28]  they just looked back at their father and said,
[4222.34 --> 4222.62]  yeah, dad,
[4222.66 --> 4223.44]  the heart reason why.
[4225.14 --> 4225.34]  Right?
[4225.40 --> 4228.84]  The habitual and ritual of regular confession
[4228.84 --> 4230.78]  makes you humble,
[4231.00 --> 4234.50]  and it only increases your integrity in life and faith.
[4235.10 --> 4238.50]  The habitual and ritual of regular rest
[4238.50 --> 4242.78]  makes you stronger to endure more trial and suffering.
[4243.14 --> 4245.72]  The habitual and ritual of scripture reading
[4245.72 --> 4247.16]  and Bible memorization
[4247.16 --> 4250.22]  puts the very words of God on your heart
[4250.22 --> 4251.90]  to speak against the lies
[4251.90 --> 4254.34]  that the devil whispers into your ears daily.
[4254.62 --> 4254.74]  Right?
[4254.80 --> 4255.90]  You are not good enough.
[4256.26 --> 4257.22]  Nobody loves you.
[4257.50 --> 4259.10]  You'll never be worthy.
[4259.54 --> 4260.66]  Get behind me, Satan,
[4261.28 --> 4262.90]  because I know the gospel of Jesus
[4262.90 --> 4264.34]  who lived the life I should have lived
[4264.34 --> 4265.58]  and died the death that I deserve.
[4265.66 --> 4266.60]  Get behind me, Satan,
[4266.80 --> 4268.26]  because I know the gospel of Jesus
[4268.26 --> 4268.54]  who,
[4269.42 --> 4270.90]  though I am more sinful
[4270.90 --> 4272.20]  than I would ever dare admit,
[4272.34 --> 4274.22]  I am yet more loved
[4274.22 --> 4276.54]  than I could ever imagine possible.
[4276.94 --> 4278.66]  And this is love.
[4278.74 --> 4279.84]  Not that we loved God,
[4279.90 --> 4280.84]  but that he loved us
[4280.84 --> 4281.82]  and sent his son
[4281.82 --> 4283.32]  as an atoning sacrifice
[4283.32 --> 4285.46]  for our sins.
[4287.22 --> 4289.86]  Every waking moment,
[4290.30 --> 4293.22]  the pagan world is trying to shape you
[4293.22 --> 4295.36]  and the devil is prowling around
[4295.36 --> 4297.20]  looking to devour you.
[4297.20 --> 4299.86]  You need more than one hour a week
[4299.86 --> 4300.68]  to resist him.
[4302.28 --> 4304.90]  You need more than one service a week
[4304.90 --> 4306.38]  to stand firm in the faith,
[4306.54 --> 4308.28]  even if it is the best service
[4308.28 --> 4309.56]  you've ever been to,
[4309.76 --> 4311.48]  even if it is the best preacher
[4311.48 --> 4312.44]  you've ever heard,
[4312.48 --> 4313.82]  and that means you went somewhere else this week.
[4315.16 --> 4319.62]  You need regular, habitual, ritual practices of faith.
[4319.62 --> 4322.88]  You need more because you need God.
[4327.50 --> 4328.98]  And the grace of God,
[4329.48 --> 4332.36]  who called you to his eternal glory in Christ,
[4332.48 --> 4334.20]  after you have suffered a little while,
[4334.58 --> 4336.90]  will himself restore you
[4336.90 --> 4340.78]  and make you strong, firm, and steadfast.
[4340.78 --> 4345.44]  God himself will restore you
[4345.44 --> 4349.02]  and make you strong, firm, and steadfast.
[4350.02 --> 4354.46]  The regular, habitual, ritual practices of the faith
[4354.46 --> 4358.42]  are the means by which God causes you to stand firm,
[4358.60 --> 4361.72]  are the means by which God causes you to resist the devil.
[4361.72 --> 4365.36]  Well, I led a devotional
[4365.36 --> 4369.32]  for a worship ministries team meeting last week,
[4369.66 --> 4370.54]  or two weeks ago now,
[4370.84 --> 4372.98]  and at the devotional I said,
[4373.54 --> 4374.98]  there is nothing ordinary
[4374.98 --> 4377.22]  about the ordinary means of grace.
[4378.22 --> 4381.34]  This is how God transforms us.
[4382.06 --> 4383.58]  Restoration through the regular,
[4383.94 --> 4385.58]  glimpses of heaven in the habitual,
[4386.04 --> 4387.78]  renewal by the ritual.
[4387.78 --> 4390.16]  Your enemy, the devil, prowls around
[4390.16 --> 4391.30]  looking to devour you.
[4391.52 --> 4392.94]  Instead, resist him.
[4393.40 --> 4394.26]  Stand firm,
[4394.68 --> 4397.72]  knowing that you are not alone.
[4399.80 --> 4400.62]  Resist him.
[4401.50 --> 4402.88]  Standing firm in the faith
[4402.88 --> 4405.56]  because you know that the family of believers
[4405.56 --> 4406.48]  throughout the world
[4406.48 --> 4409.50]  is undergoing the same kind of sufferings.
[4409.58 --> 4410.64]  You are not alone.
[4411.16 --> 4412.72]  It is a lie of the devil
[4412.72 --> 4414.76]  that you are alone in your struggles.
[4415.34 --> 4416.70]  It is a lie of the devil
[4416.70 --> 4419.00]  that no one else feels what you feel.
[4419.28 --> 4420.56]  It is a lie of the devil
[4420.56 --> 4424.30]  that you are left apart from the rest.
[4424.58 --> 4427.04]  You are not alone.
[4428.42 --> 4430.46]  A family of believers throughout the world
[4430.46 --> 4432.08]  shares in the struggle
[4432.08 --> 4433.98]  of being counterformed
[4433.98 --> 4435.78]  against a pagan culture.
[4435.92 --> 4437.00]  We are all struggling
[4437.00 --> 4438.18]  to resist the devil
[4438.18 --> 4439.30]  and stand firm.
[4439.50 --> 4440.72]  And we are all together,
[4440.80 --> 4441.46]  as one,
[4441.84 --> 4443.44]  pressing on toward the goal
[4443.44 --> 4444.38]  to win the prize
[4444.38 --> 4446.08]  for which God has called me heavenward
[4446.08 --> 4447.76]  in Christ Jesus.
[4449.46 --> 4450.28]  Truth is,
[4451.10 --> 4452.38]  I need your help
[4452.38 --> 4454.42]  fixing my eyes on Jesus
[4454.42 --> 4455.46]  as I run the race
[4455.46 --> 4456.52]  that's marked out for me.
[4456.78 --> 4457.26]  And you,
[4457.40 --> 4458.36]  by your encouragement
[4458.36 --> 4459.44]  and by your accountability,
[4459.90 --> 4460.34]  and yes,
[4460.42 --> 4461.68]  even by your rebuke,
[4462.02 --> 4463.74]  you are turning my face
[4463.74 --> 4464.82]  towards Jesus
[4464.82 --> 4465.86]  so that I might see
[4465.86 --> 4466.92]  the glories of him
[4466.92 --> 4468.08]  even more clearly.
[4468.08 --> 4469.80]  your job,
[4469.90 --> 4471.32]  our jobs together
[4471.32 --> 4472.82]  are to help one another
[4472.82 --> 4474.02]  fix our eyes
[4474.02 --> 4475.56]  on the glory of Jesus.
[4475.76 --> 4476.10]  Together,
[4476.30 --> 4477.22]  we help each other
[4477.22 --> 4479.20]  by stirring one another's affections
[4479.20 --> 4479.76]  for Jesus
[4479.76 --> 4480.94]  and the gospel.
[4482.14 --> 4482.50]  Together,
[4482.84 --> 4483.66]  we proclaim
[4483.66 --> 4485.10]  and reveal.
[4485.46 --> 4485.74]  Together,
[4486.34 --> 4487.54]  we proclaim
[4487.54 --> 4488.46]  by revealing
[4488.46 --> 4489.88]  the kingdom come
[4489.88 --> 4491.88]  and the kingdom coming.
[4493.70 --> 4495.20]  It's also why history
[4495.20 --> 4496.24]  is so important
[4496.24 --> 4497.30]  to us as Christians.
[4498.72 --> 4500.34]  In our present darkness,
[4500.62 --> 4501.60]  it is always hard
[4501.60 --> 4503.48]  to see your own way out.
[4504.46 --> 4505.48]  And the faithful Christians
[4505.48 --> 4506.30]  of the past
[4506.30 --> 4507.52]  or faithful Christians
[4507.52 --> 4508.36]  on the other side
[4508.36 --> 4508.92]  of the world
[4508.92 --> 4510.50]  can show us a way.

[4511.70 --> 4513.02]  can light the way forward
[4513.02 --> 4513.94]  into the future.
[4515.78 --> 4516.44]  Your enemy,
[4516.60 --> 4516.94]  the devil,
[4517.10 --> 4517.96]  prowls around
[4517.96 --> 4519.96]  looking to devour you.
[4521.22 --> 4521.64]  Instead,
[4522.20 --> 4522.98]  resist him.
[4523.72 --> 4524.58]  Stand firm,
[4524.96 --> 4527.42]  knowing you are not alone.
[4528.08 --> 4529.20]  this,
[4530.24 --> 4531.30]  beloved of God,
[4532.40 --> 4534.60]  chosen by him.
[4535.36 --> 4537.64]  This is how you show
[4537.64 --> 4539.10]  the living hope
[4539.10 --> 4541.92]  that changes the world.
[4542.60 --> 4544.78]  To him be power
[4544.78 --> 4546.54]  forever and ever.
[4547.04 --> 4548.02]  And all God's people said,
[4548.54 --> 4549.46]  amen.
[4549.46 --> 4551.34]  Lord Jesus Christ,
[4551.46 --> 4552.60]  we thank you for

[4569.92 --> 4570.96]  we cling to the promise
[4570.96 --> 4571.68]  that your word
[4571.68 --> 4572.26]  goes out
[4572.26 --> 4573.48]  and will not return
[4573.48 --> 4573.98]  to you
[4573.98 --> 4574.58]  without it
[4574.58 --> 4575.64]  accomplishing the purpose
[4575.64 --> 4577.00]  for which you sent it.
[4577.00 --> 4577.50]  And so,
