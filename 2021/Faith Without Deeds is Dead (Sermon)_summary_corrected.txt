• Faith vs Deeds
• James 2:14-19 as reference text
• The story of Pi from "The Life of Pi" used to illustrate faith and actions
• Different types of faith:
  • Faith that is alone (isolated)
  • Faith that works (with deeds)
• Characteristics of a faith that works:
  • Changes the person
  • Affects reality
  • Includes wisdom, steadfastness, slowness to anger, quickness to listen, and actions based on what it hears
• Faith alone is not enough to be considered true faith
• True faith changes a person's behaviour and actions
• Good deeds follow from true faith, but they do not earn salvation
• Deeds without faith are worthless and do not save
• James' example of the person who walks by the brother in need illustrates faith without works
• Faith without works is dead and useless
• James affirms that faith alone does not save, but rather it is a gift from God.
• Faith and deeds are intertwined
• Separating faith and deeds results in a dead faith
• Deeds are an expression of true faith
• James uses the example of demons believing in one God to illustrate that mere belief is not enough
• The Jewish concept of monotheism (one God) is referenced
• Demons know God but do not act on their faith
• James commends someone for believing that God is one and encourages them to demonstrate good deeds.
• Faith alone saves, but a saving faith is never isolated from good works.
• Good deeds follow true faith as a result and signifier of its authenticity.
• The Holy Spirit sanctifies through the promise of making us like Christ.
• Jesus' sacrifice on the cross is essential for salvation, and it's a gift of God's undeserved grace.
• Salvation is not earned through human effort or good deeds but by God's sheer grace alone.
• The Bible's catechism encapsulates James' teaching on true faith and its fruit
• True faith is a deep-rooted assurance created in believers by the Holy Spirit through the Gospel
• Those with true faith produce fruits of gratitude, including good deeds
• Good deeds follow faith and are a result of being made like Christ through sanctification
• The Holy Spirit works out salvation in believers to make them more like Christ every day
• Good deeds are done because of God's strength, goodness, faithfulness, and Spirit working in us
• Gratitude and obedience signify true faith
• Members of the church should act like Christ and do good deeds with God's strength
• Prayer for salvation, thanksgiving, and appreciation for God's Word and truth
• Acknowledgment of sinful nature and need for God's grace and love
• Request to be made more like Christ through truer faith and sanctification by the Spirit
