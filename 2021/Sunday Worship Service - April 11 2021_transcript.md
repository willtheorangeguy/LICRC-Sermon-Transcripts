[0.00 --> 5.92]  I would have labeled me a lost car, cause I feel just like a lost car.
[7.32 --> 12.72]  If I were you, I would have turned around and walked away.
[13.28 --> 19.72]  I would have labeled me beyond repair, cause I feel like I'm beyond repair.
[21.38 --> 24.74]  Oh, but somehow you don't see me like I do.
[25.18 --> 27.90]  Somehow you're still here.
[27.90 --> 31.50]  You're the God who stays.
[31.94 --> 34.68]  You're the God who stays.
[35.64 --> 42.60]  You're the one who runs in my direction when the whole world walks away.
[42.86 --> 48.96]  You're the God who stands with wide open arms.
[48.96 --> 53.66]  And you tell me nothing I have ever done.
[53.66 --> 58.20]  Cause separate my heart from the God who stays.
[58.20 --> 62.60]  I used to hide.
[63.24 --> 65.88]  Every time I thought I let you down.
[66.58 --> 69.14]  Always thought I had to earn my way.
[69.90 --> 72.70]  But I'm learning you don't work that way.
[74.08 --> 77.70]  Cause somehow you don't see me like I do.
[78.06 --> 80.20]  Somehow you're still here.
[80.20 --> 83.80]  You're the God who stays.
[83.80 --> 87.48]  You're the God who stays.

[98.96 --> 101.60]  With a wide open heart.
[101.60 --> 106.50]  And you tell me nothing I have ever done.
[106.50 --> 111.94]  Cause separate my heart from the God who stays.
[111.94 --> 116.32]  My shame can't separate.
[116.32 --> 119.70]  My guilt can't separate.
[119.70 --> 123.08]  My past can't separate.
[123.08 --> 125.82]  I'm yours forever.
[126.94 --> 129.86]  My sin can't separate.
[129.86 --> 133.24]  My scars can't separate.
[133.24 --> 136.58]  My failures can't separate.
[136.58 --> 139.58]  I'm yours forever.
[139.58 --> 143.58]  No will in me can't separate.
[143.58 --> 146.98]  No power in heaven can take away.
[146.98 --> 150.68]  Your love for me will never change.
[150.76 --> 153.70]  I'm yours forever.
[156.20 --> 159.28]  Cause you're the God who stays.
[159.56 --> 162.10]  You're the God who stays.
[163.14 --> 166.66]  You're the one who runs in my direction.

[176.06 --> 177.84]  You're the God who stays.
[177.84 --> 179.84]  You're the one who runs in my direction.
[179.84 --> 194.06]  When the whole world walks away.
[194.06 --> 195.06]  You're the God who stays.
[195.06 --> 197.38]  You're the God who stays.
[197.38 --> 198.60]  With wide open arms.
[198.60 --> 200.50]  You tell me nothing I have done.
[200.50 --> 202.86]  Cause separate my heart from the God who stays.
[202.86 --> 207.98]  And you tell me nothing I have ever done
[207.98 --> 213.12]  Could separate my heart from the God who stays
[232.86 --> 245.58]  Before I spoke a word, you were singing over me
[245.58 --> 254.02]  You have been so, so good to me

[915.74 --> 923.74]  For our confession and assurance this morning, we'd like to read the question and answer 86 from the Heidelberg Catechism.
[923.74 --> 927.74]  I will read the question and please join us in the answer.
[928.74 --> 939.74]  Since we have been delivered from our misery by grace through Christ, without any merit of our own, why then should we do good works?
[939.74 --> 950.74]  Because Christ, having redeemed us by His blood, is also restoring us by His heart and His image,
[950.74 --> 957.74]  so that with our whole lives, we may show that we are thankful to God for His benefits,
[957.74 --> 961.74]  so that we may praise through us,
[961.74 --> 965.74]  so that we are assured by our faith by His words,
[966.74 --> 972.74]  and so that by our godly living, our neighbors may be run over to Christ.
[972.74 --> 976.74]  and so that the fruits wilderness among you and our heart and our hearts were immes�� by us,

[980.74 --> 981.74]  Amen.
[1010.74 --> 1012.74]  Draw me closer.
[1015.74 --> 1020.74]  Lord, my heart is set on you.
[1022.74 --> 1029.74]  Let me run the race of time with your life in full demise.
[1029.74 --> 1037.74]  And let the peace of God let it rain.
[1037.74 --> 1043.74]  Oh, Holy Spirit, you're my comfort.
[1046.74 --> 1053.74]  Strengthen me, hold my hand up high.
[1053.74 --> 1061.74]  And I'll stand upon your truth, bringing glory unto you.

[1069.74 --> 1077.74]  Oh, Lord, I hunger for more of you.

[1123.74 --> 1129.74]  Lord, my heart is set on you.
[1129.74 --> 1139.74]  Let me run the race of time with your life unfolding mine.
[1139.74 --> 1145.74]  And let the peace of God let it rain.
[1145.74 --> 1155.74]  Oh, Holy Spirit, you're my comfort.
[1155.74 --> 1163.74]  Strengthen me, hold my hand up high.
[1163.74 --> 1171.74]  And I'll stand upon your truth, bringing glory unto you.

[1232.74 --> 1237.74]  Josh has been busy at work behind the scenes, so take a look at this.
[1237.74 --> 1247.74]  How will it rain made at work behind the scenes?

[1264.74 --> 1266.56]  Western Burmulu
[1294.74 --> 1318.74]  Thank you.
[1324.74 --> 1332.50]  Hi, kids. Welcome to Kids' Corner again this week. I am so excited that you're joining
[1332.50 --> 1336.48]  us today, and I want to invite you to please come on forward, come a little bit closer,
[1336.62 --> 1341.30]  sit nice and close to the TV, at least as close as your parents will let you, and we
[1341.30 --> 1344.88]  are going to, we're going to do some fun things today. We're going to hear a memory verse
[1344.88 --> 1349.08]  like we do, we're going to hear a Bible story today, and it's going to be a fun time. So
[1349.08 --> 1354.02]  come close, sit down, and be ready. The first thing we've got today, though, is a memory
[1354.02 --> 1358.14]  verse. And before the video starts, I want to remind you, don't just watch the video,
[1358.14 --> 1362.06]  whether you're at home, whether you're a kid or a grown-up, or whether you're sitting here
[1362.06 --> 1367.18]  in church today, don't just watch the video. The point is to say the memory verse with them.
[1367.30 --> 1371.96]  So do the actions, say the words, and let's take a look at this video right now.
[1373.14 --> 1378.10]  Hi, everyone. I'm going to show you the actions for our memory verse one more time. Please
[1378.10 --> 1387.48]  join me. For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son, that anyone who
[1387.48 --> 1394.38]  believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal life. John 3, 16.
[1394.38 --> 1407.62]  Hey, Hank. Hey, Kevin. Was that the lady that sat on me? Wow, Hank, that's true. She did sit on me. That was a long time ago. You still remember that?
[1407.86 --> 1414.14]  I never forget. Wow, that's good. I'm glad you have such a good memory, Hank. Do you remember what we talked about last week?
[1414.14 --> 1422.46]  You don't remember. Kids, do you remember what we talked about last week? It was kind of a big deal.
[1423.20 --> 1425.48]  Can you say it out loud right now? One, two, three.
[1426.80 --> 1430.10]  Easter. That's right, Hank. It was Easter. Right. Easter.
[1430.74 --> 1434.16]  We celebrated Easter. Yeah, and we had so much fun.
[1434.82 --> 1438.14]  Mrs. Nikki, she made some baked goods here at Kids Corner.
[1438.56 --> 1441.12]  Maybe you got to try those at home, too, with your parents.
[1441.12 --> 1444.54]  I know people at church got to try them. I was a little bit jealous that I wasn't here.
[1445.10 --> 1453.02]  But we also remembered the most important thing of all, that Jesus not only died for our sins, but he rose again from the grave,
[1453.12 --> 1455.26]  defeating sin and death for us. Isn't that wonderful?
[1455.78 --> 1457.24]  Yeah, that is wonderful.
[1457.82 --> 1464.54]  Well, today, we are going to look at a couple other stories, or not a couple other stories, one other story,
[1464.58 --> 1468.46]  about a couple of men that went for a walk.
[1468.46 --> 1471.88]  Do you like walks, Hank? I love walks! Yeah!
[1472.94 --> 1477.72]  All right! Walk, walk, walk, walk! Hank, settle down. Walk, walk, walk! Hank, simmer down. Walk, walk, walk!
[1479.72 --> 1483.44]  There we go. Simmer down.
[1484.30 --> 1485.50]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[1485.88 --> 1490.72]  Just sit here. We're going to read this story, okay, about two men who went for a walk.
[1490.82 --> 1493.92]  It happened right after Jesus rose from the dead.
[1493.92 --> 1496.18]  So we're going to take a look at that right now. Kids, are you ready?
[1497.14 --> 1498.82]  You have to help me open the book, Hank. Are you ready?
[1499.18 --> 1499.44]  Mm-hmm.
[1505.18 --> 1506.96]  Good job, Hank. You did great.
[1507.16 --> 1507.44]  Thanks.
[1507.98 --> 1512.08]  All right. So this is the story of the road to Emmaus.
[1512.10 --> 1512.56]  Are you ready?
[1512.84 --> 1513.18]  Mm-hmm.
[1513.34 --> 1514.20]  Are you ready, kids?
[1514.84 --> 1515.66]  All right. Here we go.
[1515.66 --> 1519.84]  Later that day, this was the day that Jesus rose from the dead.
[1520.32 --> 1524.30]  Later that day, two of them were walking to a village called Emmaus
[1524.30 --> 1527.14]  when a stranger came and walked along with them.
[1527.52 --> 1527.80]  Hmm.
[1528.16 --> 1530.40]  What are you discussing? He asked.
[1530.88 --> 1534.16]  What everyone is talking about, one of the disciples answered.
[1534.76 --> 1537.08]  Have you not been here the past three days?
[1537.64 --> 1540.36]  Then they told the whole story of what had happened to Jesus.
[1541.10 --> 1541.46]  Hmm.
[1541.46 --> 1543.76]  After a stranger heard this, he said,
[1544.20 --> 1546.20]  Why are you so slow to believe?
[1546.88 --> 1550.14]  He reminded them of everything the prophets had written about Jesus,
[1550.54 --> 1553.78]  and especially the part where Jesus would come back to life.
[1554.78 --> 1558.50]  When they got to Emmaus, the disciples invited the man to have supper with them.
[1558.80 --> 1560.16]  I love supper!
[1560.58 --> 1561.68]  Me too. Me too, Hank.
[1562.02 --> 1567.00]  He sat at their table, he took some bread, he blessed it, and he broke it.
[1567.26 --> 1568.84]  And then he passed it to them.
[1569.10 --> 1569.86]  And did you know what?
[1569.86 --> 1574.26]  That is when they all realized that they knew him.
[1574.86 --> 1575.18]  Right!
[1576.14 --> 1578.02]  Lord Jesus, they cried out.
[1578.32 --> 1579.22]  It's you!
[1579.84 --> 1582.82]  And then suddenly, Jesus disappeared.
[1583.14 --> 1583.40]  Ah!
[1584.36 --> 1587.42]  They found the other disciples and told them what was happening.
[1587.76 --> 1589.14]  He's alive, they agreed.
[1589.50 --> 1591.98]  Our Lord Jesus lives.
[1592.64 --> 1593.74]  Isn't that something?
[1594.28 --> 1598.72]  These two men on the road saw Jesus after he'd come to life.
[1598.72 --> 1600.84]  And Jesus explained everything that was happening.
[1601.32 --> 1602.44]  Isn't that so cool?
[1602.84 --> 1604.00]  That is cool!
[1604.00 --> 1609.96]  Yeah, and so we can remember that too, that Jesus lives, and that he fulfilled his promises to us,
[1610.02 --> 1612.80]  because God keeps his promises, right?
[1613.28 --> 1613.62]  Right!
[1614.22 --> 1616.44]  Hank, I wanted to share something else that's happening right now.
[1616.50 --> 1621.26]  Did you know that people are driving around, dropping off treats at people's doors right now,
[1621.32 --> 1622.66]  to celebrate community?
[1622.66 --> 1623.66]  Wow!
[1623.66 --> 1625.02]  What kind of treats?
[1625.22 --> 1626.06]  Oh, all sorts of things.
[1626.28 --> 1627.10]  Like bones?
[1627.56 --> 1629.14]  I'm not sure people are bringing bones.
[1629.24 --> 1629.36]  No.
[1629.58 --> 1631.16]  What about those snossages?
[1631.62 --> 1633.24]  I don't think people eat snossages.
[1633.40 --> 1634.98]  I think that's just something you eat, Hank.
[1635.26 --> 1635.52]  Hmm.
[1635.92 --> 1636.74]  What about sticks?
[1636.98 --> 1638.12]  Yeah, I think they're bringing sticks.
[1638.26 --> 1638.94]  I think that's what they're doing.
[1639.00 --> 1641.12]  They're dropping lots of sticks off at people's doors.
[1641.56 --> 1642.74]  That is awesome!
[1643.24 --> 1644.28]  Maybe I'll get one.
[1644.62 --> 1644.90]  Maybe.
[1645.02 --> 1647.08]  We'll have to send out your address to people for that, right?
[1647.32 --> 1647.60]  Hmm.
[1647.64 --> 1648.30]  Can you do that?
[1648.30 --> 1649.84]  We'll see how that all goes, okay, Hank?
[1650.16 --> 1650.44]  All right.
[1650.52 --> 1654.54]  So take part in that church, too, as a celebration of community and the body of believers that
[1654.54 --> 1657.94]  Jesus died and rose again for as well.
[1657.98 --> 1659.82]  And remember our neighbors in that way, too.
[1660.22 --> 1662.88]  So that's what we wanted to talk about today.
[1662.96 --> 1663.46]  Was that fun?
[1663.74 --> 1664.08]  Mm-hmm.
[1664.22 --> 1665.00]  Was that fun, kids?
[1665.88 --> 1666.40]  All right.
[1666.44 --> 1666.66]  Good.
[1666.84 --> 1672.08]  So let me pray, and then we will be able to do the crafts and other activities that maybe
[1672.08 --> 1674.98]  your parents have or that Mrs. Nikki has emailed out to you all.
[1675.08 --> 1675.96]  So let's pray.
[1675.96 --> 1681.54]  Dear God, thank you so much for this wonderful story of these two men on the road to Emmaus.
[1681.98 --> 1687.86]  Thank you for your promise to defeat sin and evil for us and for the sacrifice you made
[1687.86 --> 1692.74]  for us and that you rose again from the dead and that we can be reminded of that today again
[1692.74 --> 1693.90]  and again and again.
[1694.40 --> 1699.90]  Be with us as we remember that, that we can live lives of kindness and that we can live
[1699.90 --> 1701.28]  lives serving you.
[1701.74 --> 1704.60]  We just pray that you will allow us to remember to do that.
[1704.60 --> 1705.78]  We pray this in your name.
[1706.14 --> 1706.38]  Amen.
[1706.92 --> 1707.60]  Say bye, Hank.
[1707.84 --> 1708.76]  Bye, Hank!
[1708.96 --> 1710.56]  That joke doesn't get old for you, does it?
[1710.68 --> 1711.12]  Mm-mm.
[1711.66 --> 1712.26]  Bye, kids.
[1712.26 --> 1718.68]  Good morning.
[1718.68 --> 1725.96]  My name is John, and I serve as one of the elders here in Emmanuel Church here.
[1726.86 --> 1734.28]  I would like to, this morning, let you know what we are, where our offerings are for today,
[1734.28 --> 1740.54]  and we will continue to worship as we tithe with the gifts that God has blessed us with.
[1741.10 --> 1747.46]  Today's offering is for the budget of this church and for World Renew Refugee Sponsorship.
[1747.46 --> 1754.18]  When we think of refugees, we hear the biblical call to welcome the stranger.
[1756.18 --> 1758.20]  In Leviticus, we find these words,
[1758.20 --> 1763.16]  When a foreigner resides among you in your land, do not mistreat them.
[1763.82 --> 1769.22]  The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born.
[1770.16 --> 1774.68]  Love them as yourselves, for you are foreigners in Egypt.
[1774.74 --> 1784.30]  World Renew is an official sponsorship agreement holder with Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada.
[1784.30 --> 1792.68]  This enables the CRC, the Christian Reformed Church, to sponsor refugees for resettlement to Canada.
[1793.62 --> 1800.08]  Since 1979, World Renew has responded to needs of refugees from around the globe
[1800.08 --> 1805.30]  and helped settle over 10,500 refugees in Canada.
[1806.44 --> 1811.96]  More specifically, World Renew has made it possible for this church
[1811.96 --> 1816.24]  to settle two families, a total of 12 people, from Iraq.
[1817.64 --> 1824.46]  World Renew Refugee Sponsorship is a way of putting faith into action that changes lives,
[1825.68 --> 1829.20]  both that of this refugee and the sponsor.
[1829.20 --> 1848.12]  World Renew Refugee Sponsorship is a Canadian Christian charity that advances Christ-centered education in Central America,
[1849.12 --> 1853.52]  the Caribbean, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia.
[1853.52 --> 1862.12]  Established first in the United States in 1986, it now has offices in Hamilton, Ontario also.
[1863.46 --> 1866.84]  Every child needs purpose, meaning, and joy.
[1867.88 --> 1871.00]  Christ-centered education does just that.
[1871.20 --> 1877.48]  Edudeo works exclusively through partnerships with locally-led organizations.
[1877.48 --> 1887.46]  In the past, Edudeo has partnered with Langley Christian in Gondolikwithwa in South Africa.
[1888.10 --> 1890.06]  And I apologize if I mispronounce that.
[1890.94 --> 1897.62]  After the service, remember to give generously using the links that you find in your e-bulletin.
[1904.44 --> 1907.08]  We will now come to the Lord in prayer.
[1907.08 --> 1913.26]  And before I do that, we do that, I would like to just make an announcement here.
[1915.58 --> 1925.92]  We are in our church in that season where we are looking for men and women to serve in leadership positions of elder and deacon in this church.
[1926.08 --> 1929.00]  And so I would just like to read these words to you.
[1929.00 --> 1959.00] 
[1959.00 --> 1965.18]  We are in our church.
[1965.18 --> 1970.96]  The call of the church through nominations, the call of God to serve the bride of Christ is voiced.
[1972.14 --> 1978.68]  A link to the nomination form is available through the midweek memo and the e-bulletin.
[1978.68 --> 1995.34]  Please complete the following form by submitting a name or names of individuals who you have approached and are willing to serve as either an administration elder, pastoral elder, or deacon.
[1995.34 --> 2001.96]  You can submit more than one name or more than one position.
[2002.60 --> 2005.66]  We have a total of eight vacancies this year.
[2006.34 --> 2014.96]  If you are being called, please prayerfully consider serving the church in this capacity.
[2014.96 --> 2022.20]  The nomination forms, we will be closing this on April 19th.
[2022.50 --> 2030.56]  If you have any questions about this, serving on council or the process of nomination, please contact your district elder.
[2030.56 --> 2060.54]  We will enter in prayer.
[2060.56 --> 2061.56]  I am confident of that.
[2061.56 --> 2068.10]  I am confident that he is here with us and that he hears us.
[2070.50 --> 2075.22]  I also, something hit me this morning as we were worshiping in song.
[2077.34 --> 2082.20]  As we worship virtually from our homes, we listen to the words being spoken.
[2082.38 --> 2085.56]  We sing the songs that are being sung.
[2086.40 --> 2089.34]  But there is nothing like singing in church.
[2090.56 --> 2091.82]  This is a wonderful experience.
[2091.82 --> 2097.52]  And we do look forward to the day where we may all come together again in body to worship together here.
[2097.66 --> 2098.78]  It will be wonderful.
[2100.38 --> 2101.92]  We are going to come in prayer.
[2102.02 --> 2103.00]  There's a few things.
[2103.00 --> 2107.44]  There are many things that we want to remember this morning.
[2107.44 --> 2109.70]  And I know that God hears us.
[2109.70 --> 2112.68]  The words spoken and also the words that are not spoken.
[2113.74 --> 2122.98]  And in your e-bulletin and in the midweek memoirs, you will find a lot of notices and things that are mentioned that we need to remember in prayer.
[2123.12 --> 2125.78]  And I will perhaps forget some of them this morning.
[2125.78 --> 2128.34]  The Lord will forgive us.
[2129.24 --> 2131.94]  But he does hear us and he knows our thoughts.
[2132.80 --> 2136.06]  And so we will bow our heads.
[2136.18 --> 2137.68]  I want to mention a few things.
[2137.78 --> 2142.46]  One is Aaron Alkema has contracted COVID-19.
[2142.46 --> 2150.64]  And remember him and his family, Brenda and Rob and the kids as well as they navigate through this.
[2150.92 --> 2155.82]  There perhaps are others in our church who are experiencing this as well or going through it in other ways.
[2156.36 --> 2158.46]  And so there are some challenges with that.
[2160.74 --> 2162.72]  Shall we come to the Lord in prayer?
[2166.26 --> 2167.38]  Our Father in heaven,
[2167.38 --> 2170.72]  What a morning.
[2171.04 --> 2171.88]  What a beautiful day.
[2172.46 --> 2183.42]  Lord, you have brought us here together to worship you in word and in song, in body and in spirit.
[2185.18 --> 2194.24]  Lord, there are a few of us here in the church building and yet we know there are many more who are worshiping virtually through the screen.
[2195.82 --> 2198.44]  Lord, we thank you for technology.
[2198.62 --> 2200.34]  We thank you that we were able to do that.
[2200.34 --> 2201.58]  And still,
[2201.58 --> 2207.10]  Lord, we do look forward to the day when we be here together again.
[2209.94 --> 2210.80]  Lord, there are,
[2211.30 --> 2213.38]  you are a great God.
[2213.86 --> 2215.58]  You have provided us with so much.
[2215.90 --> 2217.92]  You have provided us with all that we stand in need of.
[2218.84 --> 2220.96]  Each day, Lord, and still we
[2220.96 --> 2224.32]  so often want more,
[2224.32 --> 2231.22]  we become selfish and greedy and that, Lord, may we know that we are in your hand above us.
[2231.28 --> 2235.90]  Thank you for our church family.
[2235.90 --> 2247.88]  Lord, we pray that we may not be together at this time still, Lord, that you would watch over each one.
[2247.88 --> 2254.66]  Lord, we pray for Aaron Alkama.
[2256.40 --> 2261.00]  Lord, as he navigates through COVID,
[2261.12 --> 2263.44]  he's now in the illness.
[2263.74 --> 2265.94]  We pray, Lord, that you would provide healing.
[2266.48 --> 2272.90]  We pray for the family that they navigate this with him through isolation and other means that are necessary.
[2272.90 --> 2275.58]  Lord, give them strength.
[2276.58 --> 2280.68]  Lord, we pray that for other families, too, that may be going through this also.
[2281.48 --> 2286.14]  But even though we may not know who they are, Lord, you do know them and we pray for them.
[2286.24 --> 2287.88]  And that you know them also.
[2289.14 --> 2294.84]  Lord, there are many in our church who also are being isolated.
[2296.38 --> 2297.86]  Through this, we pray for Judy.
[2299.00 --> 2300.24]  Lord, we pray for Janet.
[2300.24 --> 2300.34]  Lord, we pray for Janet.
[2302.90 --> 2310.20]  There are others, Lord, too, whose health is suffering and, Lord, who have illnesses,
[2310.90 --> 2316.38]  which also causes them to not be able to do the things that they want.
[2318.08 --> 2319.52]  Lord, we pray for each one.
[2319.60 --> 2320.62]  We pray for healing.
[2322.04 --> 2324.14]  Lord, we pray for your hand over each one.
[2324.14 --> 2330.34]  Lord, we pray for Mike, Sam's brother.
[2331.30 --> 2336.56]  Lord, who grieves with his family, children and grandchildren at this time, the death of his wife.
[2340.22 --> 2343.96]  And, Lord, we pray that you would give them strength, that you would give them comfort.
[2343.96 --> 2352.38]  Lord, may they lean on you and know, Lord, that you are there watching over them and that you care for them.
[2354.66 --> 2361.92]  Lord, we pray for George also as he grieves the passing away of his wife.
[2362.76 --> 2366.66]  Him, Lord, we pray for him and his family also.
[2366.66 --> 2371.46]  Protect them, Lord, give them what they stand in need of.
[2371.46 --> 2375.94]  We pray for the Bridge Church as they also go through this with George.
[2379.52 --> 2383.48]  Lord, may each one know that you are there and that you care for them.
[2383.48 --> 2390.28]  Lord, we pray that Frank may continue to experience healing of his back
[2390.28 --> 2398.10]  and that he too may soon again be able to do his normal daily activities again.
[2400.00 --> 2406.92]  Lord, we want to remember those who are unemployed at this time.
[2406.92 --> 2413.46]  Lord, each week there seems to be new restrictions and sometimes restrictions get loosened.
[2413.48 --> 2414.72]  And then they get tightened again.
[2414.84 --> 2419.36]  And, Lord, for many their jobs become unsecure.
[2420.92 --> 2423.52]  Not knowing, Lord, what each day will be like.
[2423.62 --> 2426.40]  And, Lord, this is difficult for people to navigate through.
[2426.40 --> 2430.44]  And it brings in emotional roller coasters.
[2430.68 --> 2434.28]  Lord, may we lean on you during these difficult times also.
[2434.28 --> 2445.14]  And, Lord, we pray that each one may again find reliable employment and secure employment.
[2447.48 --> 2449.52]  Lord, you have gifted each one.
[2449.52 --> 2455.10]  And we pray, Lord, that each may be able to use the gifts that you have given them to.
[2455.10 --> 2462.58]  Lord, there are many who are also experiencing relationships that struggle and that are broken.
[2465.08 --> 2469.88]  For husbands and wives, for their children, Lord, and grandchildren that are involved.
[2471.96 --> 2476.48]  Lord, these are difficult roads to navigate also.
[2476.48 --> 2480.54]  And, Lord, we pray for healing.
[2481.86 --> 2492.98]  We pray, Lord, that each one would seek you for to make things better again.
[2493.26 --> 2496.76]  And, Lord, we thank you for this church.
[2496.92 --> 2499.70]  We thank you, Lord, for the programs also that we have here.
[2499.70 --> 2502.60]  And, Lord, we pray for gems.
[2502.82 --> 2503.74]  We pray for the youth.
[2505.36 --> 2512.20]  Lord, we pray for the programs that they have each week or each other, every other week that they may go well.
[2515.08 --> 2525.02]  And, Lord, now as we also go through this treat tag, Lord, these are programs that we hope to be able to encourage youth to get involved in.
[2525.02 --> 2536.86]  Lord, Lord, to hold them together and that, Lord, in all things, they too would be able to be involved in this church.
[2539.80 --> 2543.98]  Lord, we pray for the leadership of this church.
[2544.76 --> 2547.06]  We thank you for each one that gives us the time.
[2547.06 --> 2562.10]  Lord, we pray that as we seek nominations of those, Lord, who are able to serve in the capacity of admin or pastoral elder or deacon, Lord,
[2562.14 --> 2568.54]  that you would work in their hearts through your spirit, that they would be encouraged to let their name stand.
[2571.54 --> 2576.84]  So that the work of this church may continue, that we may continue to serve as a light in this community.
[2577.06 --> 2583.96]  Lord, we pray that we may be able to spread your good news to those who do not know you.
[2584.50 --> 2591.62]  Lord, we pray that this day, too, there would be many who would turn their hearts to you as they hear your word, maybe perhaps for the first time.
[2592.66 --> 2597.44]  We ask, Lord, to be with Pastor Chris this morning.
[2597.44 --> 2614.14]  Lord, as he brings your word to us, through your spirit, Lord, may he be given the words to speak, that he may speak them boldly, that we may hear them, Lord, and that we may obey you.
[2614.96 --> 2616.62]  We pray this, Lord, in your name.
[2617.06 --> 2617.40]  Amen.
[2617.40 --> 2617.56]  Amen.
[2617.56 --> 2617.64]  Amen.
[2626.38 --> 2630.26]  We're going to come together and hear God's word.
[2630.58 --> 2632.86]  We're jumping back into the book of James.
[2632.86 --> 2638.56]  And so if you have a Bible in hand or on a device, wherever that might be, I encourage you to grab that.
[2639.14 --> 2641.26]  This morning we're going to read from James 3.
[2641.60 --> 2645.38]  We're going to go from verse 13 through verse 18.
[2645.38 --> 2651.60]  And as you're getting that ready, I want to put an image in front of you and encourage you to hold that.
[2651.68 --> 2654.60]  And so here I have a pitcher of water and a glass.
[2657.58 --> 2658.74]  Here's a glass of water.
[2660.98 --> 2663.96]  And then I have a bottle of water.
[2666.02 --> 2672.00]  I probably should have opened, but leave that here so that you can prove that it's just a regular bottle of water.
[2673.04 --> 2674.56]  And so here you have a glass of water.
[2675.38 --> 2685.80]  Now, if we were to play the shuffle dice game and move these around back and forth, which I'm not going to do, by looking at them, would you be able to tell which is which?
[2686.70 --> 2689.44]  Other than the fact that I didn't pour them evenly, Kevin, I see that.
[2691.92 --> 2692.86]  They look identical.
[2694.12 --> 2699.76]  Two glasses of water that look, for all intents and purposes, exactly the same.
[2699.76 --> 2706.58]  Hold that image as we read James 3, starting in verse 13.
[2706.58 --> 2714.26]  Who is wise and understanding among you?
[2715.06 --> 2720.22]  Let them show it by their good life, by deeds done in humility that comes from wisdom.
[2721.56 --> 2728.72]  But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition, in your hearts do not boast about it or deny the truth.
[2728.72 --> 2734.96]  Such wisdom does not come from heaven, but is earthly, unspiritual, and demonic.
[2736.26 --> 2743.38]  For where you have envy and selfish ambition, there you find disorder and every evil practice.
[2743.38 --> 2748.46]  But the wisdom that comes from heaven is, first of all, pure.
[2749.34 --> 2756.22]  Then, peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere.
[2757.46 --> 2762.42]  Peacemakers who sow in peace reap a harvest of righteousness.
[2763.76 --> 2765.02]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2765.02 --> 2779.10]  As we begin, let me sort of give you my goal or my purpose statement, what I hope that we will see together, and then we will dig deep into that.
[2779.76 --> 2780.36]  So here it is.
[2781.16 --> 2782.84]  If you're taking notes, this is for you.
[2783.86 --> 2791.22]  How you live in the world will be determined by the wisdom about the world that you hold as true.
[2791.22 --> 2797.68]  How you live in the world will be determined by the wisdom about the world that you hold as true.
[2797.78 --> 2807.62]  Or let's say that your view of how the world works and what is best in the world will shape how you behave, believe, and belong.
[2808.86 --> 2809.04]  Right?
[2809.14 --> 2814.28]  This worldview is the word that in our church tradition we have often come back to.
[2814.62 --> 2814.74]  Right?
[2814.78 --> 2819.86]  This worldview is the wisdom you operate out of for life.
[2821.22 --> 2833.68]  In our lives, then, there is what I'm calling a wisdom war that is constantly battling for dominance and supremacy in how you see and function in the world.
[2833.74 --> 2836.86]  Or how you behave, believe, and belong in the world.
[2837.60 --> 2842.24]  And this wisdom war really is as old as time.
[2842.24 --> 2848.06]  The story of the creation of the world in Genesis 1 and 2.
[2848.58 --> 2858.34]  We are introduced to a pair of people named Adam and Eve who stand as federal heads, as representatives for all of humanity, created in the image of God.
[2858.34 --> 2867.92]  And in Genesis 3, we get the story of the serpent, of the devil, coming in and deceiving Eve and Adam.
[2869.48 --> 2872.46]  And the devil whispers and says,
[2873.08 --> 2875.60]  Did God really say?
[2876.28 --> 2881.70]  Did God really say that if you ate of this tree, you would certainly die?
[2881.70 --> 2895.56]  Did God really say that if you ate of this tree, you would certainly be the same as time as time as time as time?
[2895.56 --> 2899.88]  And it is in every aspect of how we behave, believe, and belong.
[2900.80 --> 2908.14]  Now, in this text from James 3, there is a contrast between two ideas of wisdom.
[2908.14 --> 2913.58]  On the one hand, you have a wisdom that comes from heaven, and then you have a wisdom that doesn't.
[2914.76 --> 2920.04]  Now, the first kind of wisdom, as we read, and you can take the whole thing in, is born of humility.
[2920.54 --> 2923.58]  It's revealed not first in what you know, but in what you do.
[2923.96 --> 2924.94]  So that's verse 13.
[2925.28 --> 2932.92]  This wisdom is described as being pure and peace-loving, considerate and submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere.
[2933.48 --> 2937.72]  The second kind of wisdom is rooted in envy.
[2938.14 --> 2939.56]  And selfish ambition.
[2940.34 --> 2944.74]  It manifests disorder and every evil practice, right?
[2944.84 --> 2948.54]  James says that it is earthly, unspiritual, and demonic.
[2948.76 --> 2952.88]  And as I read through that, I really can't help but think about the book of Judges.
[2952.96 --> 2960.04]  And if you're familiar with that story, in the Old Testament, right, you get the refrain that comes up over and over at the end,
[2960.10 --> 2962.58]  that everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
[2962.58 --> 2971.14]  That's the kind of society of selfish ambition, evil disorder, and evil practices that's being contrasted with.
[2972.66 --> 2982.40]  Now, to get at this more precisely, in verse 17, we are told that wisdom that comes from heaven is pure.
[2982.40 --> 2988.16]  I just want to focus in on that word for a moment as a way to get at the whole here.
[2988.88 --> 2996.04]  Now, that word pure is a word that is related to the Greek word for holy, right?
[2996.06 --> 3000.00]  And the word pure means undefiled or ritually holy.
[3000.20 --> 3001.80]  It means uncontaminated.
[3001.80 --> 3011.02]  There's a reason why I poured two glasses of water, because there's a good illustration here for what this word means that comes from chemistry.
[3012.02 --> 3018.30]  Now, pure water is, in chemistry, what's called a pure chemical compound.
[3019.34 --> 3022.18]  And this is from a textbook that I looked up this week, so this isn't for me.
[3022.18 --> 3029.72]  But a pure chemical compound is a chemical substance that is composed of a particular set of molecules or ions that are chemically bonded.
[3029.72 --> 3033.84]  Now, if you understood that, you remember grade 12 chemistry.
[3034.12 --> 3034.50]  Good job.
[3035.44 --> 3043.86]  Now, pure water is a pure chemical compound because it has the same properties and the same ratio of hydrogen to oxygen,
[3044.24 --> 3048.12]  whether you get it from a river or it's made in a laboratory, right?
[3048.54 --> 3049.12]  H2O.
[3049.24 --> 3052.00]  There are two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
[3052.32 --> 3054.36]  They're bonded together, and that makes a water molecule.
[3054.36 --> 3064.10]  Now, if you take a glass of bottled water or pure water and put it beside a glass of tap water from the kitchen,
[3064.20 --> 3068.32]  this is from the kitchen here at church, it looks exactly the same.
[3068.94 --> 3075.74]  Now, I get, before we go too far into this illustration, that there are parts of the world and there are parts of Canada, absolutely,
[3076.28 --> 3077.86]  where this illustration doesn't work.
[3077.86 --> 3085.74]  And I want to acknowledge that that is a problem, and that's a serious one, but the justice issue of that is a problem for another day, right?
[3085.80 --> 3094.86]  In most of our lives and most of us who are participating here, right, with your kitchen water and your pure water, you don't see a difference.
[3096.28 --> 3098.46]  But there is one, right?
[3098.56 --> 3101.52]  Pure water is hydrogen and oxygen.
[3101.52 --> 3108.74]  Tap water is going to have chloride and iron and calcium and chlorine in it, right?
[3108.76 --> 3110.50]  You might even be able to taste the difference.
[3111.64 --> 3116.30]  But then you'd have to ingest it, and you have to take it in, and then really you've already drank it, so it's already there.
[3117.16 --> 3118.68]  And again, let me be clear, okay?
[3118.72 --> 3122.08]  Every analogy breaks down, and this is where this analogy breaks down, right?
[3122.08 --> 3130.24]  In your tap water, in proper ratios of parts per million, having those other elements of chloride, iron, and calcium, and chlorine, that's not a bad thing, right?
[3130.24 --> 3135.84]  In many cases, those things are added in order to ensure that the water you drink is potable, is drinkable.
[3137.74 --> 3145.56]  The point that I'm trying to highlight here is that two things can look the same and yet be totally different.
[3146.42 --> 3151.22]  Or one can be a gross perversion of the other.
[3152.22 --> 3159.26]  And in our post-Christian world, I think that's what wisdom is like.
[3160.24 --> 3166.92]  Because of the impact of Christianity on Western history, because of the influence that the Christian faith has had on language,
[3167.16 --> 3172.68]  the two types of wisdom that James is contrasting can actually end up looking very much the same.
[3174.18 --> 3177.18]  They can even appear to be the same, right?
[3177.22 --> 3182.18]  Just a different source of the same thing, or just a different version of the same with the same goal.
[3182.52 --> 3185.54]  Drink deeply of either, and you will be satiated.
[3185.54 --> 3189.62]  Right? You can satisfy your thirst on tap water or on pure water.
[3189.74 --> 3190.74]  Both get the job done.
[3191.60 --> 3193.58]  One of them is just easier come by.
[3194.28 --> 3195.54]  All you have to do is turn on the tap.
[3195.92 --> 3200.30]  One of them is right there, always within reach in the best possible times and circumstances.
[3200.70 --> 3207.42]  The other requires you to look deeper, to investigate it under a microscope of critical engagement and discernment.
[3207.66 --> 3209.68]  And for some of us, that's just too hard of work.
[3209.68 --> 3213.86]  Truth is, of course, we like the easier way.
[3215.34 --> 3219.28]  Let me give you an example of what I'm talking about this, of this contrast here.
[3219.98 --> 3225.60]  It is commonly accepted wisdom in the majority world, but primarily the Western world here,
[3225.68 --> 3230.94]  that there is such a thing as universally applicable human rights.
[3231.22 --> 3231.40]  Right?
[3231.40 --> 3235.92]  That there is an inherent dignity to every human being by virtue of being human.
[3236.78 --> 3239.00]  And as Christians, we believe this to be true.
[3240.16 --> 3246.52]  Likewise, most non-Christians in the world today, even hardcore secular atheists, believe that that is true.
[3247.48 --> 3253.50]  The wisdom of human dignity and human rights is common to us all in the Western world.
[3253.50 --> 3262.50]  But, as Christians, we believe that this is true because of our being created in the image of God.
[3263.00 --> 3263.10]  Right?
[3263.16 --> 3268.72]  Precisely because God created them, male and female, in the image of God, he created them in Genesis 1, 27.
[3269.30 --> 3276.30]  We believe that all people, regardless of race or gender, ability, age, orientation, or any other identifying characteristic,
[3276.48 --> 3277.60]  have a dignity and worth.
[3277.66 --> 3281.74]  That all people have a meaning and purpose and have an identity that comes from God.
[3281.74 --> 3290.64]  People are worthy of being treated justly because God is a God of justice and we are created in his image.
[3291.46 --> 3298.66]  People are worthy of being treated mercifully because God is the God of mercy, slow to anger and abounding in love.
[3298.74 --> 3303.36]  And we are created in his image to be like him and to treat others like him.
[3303.36 --> 3312.66]  And we believe that these truths about what it means to be human are universally applicable, really,
[3313.04 --> 3318.12]  that they stand apart from time and space, are true in all time and in all places,
[3318.28 --> 3323.94]  because God himself stands apart from time and space, that he is transcendent and unchanging.
[3323.94 --> 3329.78]  And so the truth that he created us in is likewise transcendent and unchanging.
[3331.42 --> 3337.64]  And yet, as we've seen, we live in a world that affirms the idea of human rights and universal dignity,
[3337.84 --> 3342.24]  but not the source of those rights and dignity.
[3343.34 --> 3343.48]  Right?
[3343.52 --> 3349.58]  As recently as 1948, the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
[3349.58 --> 3351.92]  in which it states, quote,
[3352.42 --> 3357.96]  recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family
[3357.96 --> 3361.68]  is the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world.
[3362.32 --> 3367.24]  All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, end quote.
[3367.62 --> 3373.06]  And yet, in that document, there are no grounds for why this is true.
[3373.16 --> 3374.80]  There's no reason why this is true.
[3374.86 --> 3376.80]  It's just stated as true.
[3376.80 --> 3380.42]  And that struggle continues.
[3381.48 --> 3384.98]  Now, I get what we're about to do is going to get a little bit technical.
[3385.14 --> 3386.50]  It's going to get a little bit philosophical.
[3387.00 --> 3389.12]  And that might not be your cup of tea.
[3389.24 --> 3390.28]  And I understand that.
[3390.32 --> 3391.06]  And I appreciate that.
[3391.08 --> 3394.00]  And I encourage you just to sort of dig in with us for a moment,
[3394.34 --> 3396.34]  because I do think this is a really important point.
[3397.60 --> 3403.96]  And I also don't want to set up the contrast that I'm about to make as a straw man.
[3403.96 --> 3408.86]  And look, as Christians, I think that we can have the integrity to tackle the hardest challenges to our faith,
[3408.90 --> 3409.98]  not just the easiest ones.
[3410.04 --> 3412.10]  And so I want to lead by example in that.
[3412.18 --> 3414.84]  And so this past week, in preparing for this,
[3414.88 --> 3419.78]  I kind of dug into the canon of secular atheists and humanists,
[3419.78 --> 3426.04]  trying to find a compelling answer to the question of why universal human rights are true for all of us.
[3426.04 --> 3431.54]  And in the midst of that, right, there are some pretty easily refutable ideas that are presented.
[3432.48 --> 3437.80]  So, for instance, some people have proposed the idea of a social contract
[3437.80 --> 3444.24]  that ensures the continuation of the species as the ground for which why we have universal human rights.
[3444.32 --> 3446.16]  But this falls prey.
[3446.26 --> 3448.28]  We don't need to get into the details of it because it's too easy.
[3448.28 --> 3450.38]  But to the criticisms of social Darwinism,
[3450.38 --> 3453.82]  and it also doesn't account for why, in life and in practice,
[3454.12 --> 3460.18]  we believe that the marginalized minority of our society deserve an outsized representation.
[3461.00 --> 3464.10]  Likewise, there's another idea that tries to answer this
[3464.10 --> 3467.68]  that is a sort of a game theory evolutionary argument
[3467.68 --> 3472.34]  that really, in the end, doesn't account for the human value placed on altruism.
[3472.34 --> 3479.88]  And so, the best argument that I could find in this past week
[3479.88 --> 3486.70]  actually comes from a very boisterous and loud atheist in the world today named Sam Harris.
[3486.88 --> 3488.46]  I trust some of you have heard of him.
[3488.98 --> 3491.10]  A number of years ago, five years ago or so,
[3491.18 --> 3494.02]  he wrote a book called The Moral Landscape.
[3494.54 --> 3497.08]  And then subsequent to that, he's written a number of blogs and articles
[3497.08 --> 3498.54]  and had debates and conversations.
[3498.54 --> 3501.96]  Anyway, in this book, The Moral Landscape,
[3501.96 --> 3505.62]  he outlines what I think, in my exposure anyway,
[3505.76 --> 3508.30]  may be the best argument, secular argument,
[3508.44 --> 3511.34]  for why humans have universal dignity,
[3511.52 --> 3513.08]  why there is a universal morality.
[3514.10 --> 3516.44]  And in fact, to Harris's credit in this,
[3517.08 --> 3519.48]  years after he first published that book,
[3519.84 --> 3523.76]  he invited a public testing of his thesis.
[3524.68 --> 3524.80]  Right?
[3524.84 --> 3526.44]  And so, he invited an essay contest,
[3526.44 --> 3530.00]  and then the winning essay he gave a reward to
[3530.00 --> 3531.60]  that best criticized his work,
[3531.60 --> 3533.38]  and then he responded to that winning essay.
[3534.00 --> 3534.88]  And as part of that, he said,
[3534.96 --> 3537.48]  if you change my mind, I'll give you $20,000.
[3538.20 --> 3540.40]  If you just write the best essay, you'll get $2,000.
[3541.10 --> 3544.44]  Needless to say, the guy who won the essay contest only got $2,000.
[3544.78 --> 3549.00]  But I appreciate that he was willing to engage deeply into that.
[3549.94 --> 3552.40]  And like I said, I didn't want this to be a straw man argument,
[3552.50 --> 3554.82]  and so I wanted to find the best argument here.
[3554.82 --> 3561.52]  But Harris's basic thesis in this point is that morality can be scientifically determined
[3561.52 --> 3564.28]  because moral truths exist,
[3564.50 --> 3567.54]  and therefore, they must fall within some understanding
[3567.54 --> 3570.90]  of the way conscious minds arise in the universe.
[3570.90 --> 3575.78]  Now, Harris will go on to say that it is well-being,
[3576.14 --> 3578.94]  or in fact, he will ground it in the other end of the spectrum,
[3579.02 --> 3582.56]  a category that he develops called the worst possible misery for everyone.
[3583.40 --> 3589.08]  And it's this idea that reveals what are moral truths for conscious minds.
[3589.46 --> 3594.12]  Very carefully, in Harris's construction, this is not consequentialism,
[3594.24 --> 3596.64]  this is not classical utilitarianism,
[3596.64 --> 3600.86]  which, in fact, if it was either one of those things that would make it subject to those criticisms
[3600.86 --> 3602.32]  that I offered earlier.
[3603.50 --> 3609.98]  And again, I appreciate how Harris acknowledges that it is hard to come up with universal moral imperatives.
[3610.72 --> 3612.54]  And I think it's part of the strength of his position.
[3613.14 --> 3614.24]  In fact, Harris writes,
[3614.96 --> 3615.16]  quote,
[3615.24 --> 3619.30]  People want an ethical standard that gives them clear guidance in every situation
[3619.30 --> 3621.06]  and doesn't require too much of them.
[3621.56 --> 3623.86]  People want it to be easy, to be good,
[3623.86 --> 3628.02]  and they don't want to think that they're not living as good a life as they could be.
[3628.54 --> 3634.54]  And this is especially true when balancing one's personal well-being versus the well-being of society, end quote.
[3635.30 --> 3638.68]  And while it is hard for Harris, in his argument,
[3638.86 --> 3646.24]  it is at least theoretically possible to discern morality from scientific epistemology,
[3646.36 --> 3648.10]  the scientific ways of knowing the world,
[3648.10 --> 3655.30]  and then, out of that, it isn't a leap to make prescriptions for how we ought to behave together.
[3655.86 --> 3658.58]  For prescriptions for what he calls well-being.
[3659.80 --> 3662.82]  But, and here's where the criticism comes,
[3663.54 --> 3666.62]  Harris, in constructing his argument this way,
[3666.72 --> 3670.96]  is required to say that our knowledge of morality
[3670.96 --> 3675.72]  is ultimately intuited in the system.
[3675.72 --> 3676.72]  Right?
[3677.32 --> 3682.84]  It's ultimately something we feel before we can know it or define it.
[3683.78 --> 3685.80]  So in that way, it's not dissimilar,
[3685.88 --> 3686.76]  and he admits this too,
[3686.94 --> 3690.70]  from Immanuel Kant's version of universal categorical imperatives.
[3690.86 --> 3693.46]  Again, we don't need to get too far into that,
[3693.54 --> 3694.18]  but the point is,
[3694.42 --> 3698.66]  it still doesn't answer the fundamental question of why this moral behavior
[3698.66 --> 3700.40]  and not that moral behavior.
[3701.12 --> 3704.78]  And it doesn't answer the question about what is unique about human beings
[3704.78 --> 3708.38]  that makes something like mercy and justice not competing values,
[3708.52 --> 3710.46]  but complementary values.
[3710.46 --> 3715.46]  It doesn't address how such virtues are truly transcendent and not situational,
[3715.80 --> 3719.16]  right, beyond the argument that they are just because they are.
[3719.88 --> 3721.08]  Because that's ultimately where he lands.
[3721.18 --> 3725.22]  In the end, Harris, I think, is forced to say that when it comes to morality,
[3725.22 --> 3729.14]  specifically when it comes to universal human rights,
[3729.54 --> 3731.08]  it just is.
[3732.34 --> 3735.00]  And because for Harris, God isn't,
[3735.96 --> 3737.56]  something else has to be.
[3738.56 --> 3743.24]  But there's no way that Harris can empirically prove either claim to be true,
[3743.64 --> 3743.84]  right?
[3743.86 --> 3746.02]  For all his claims about this being scientific,
[3746.02 --> 3747.34]  he can't prove it,
[3748.08 --> 3749.66]  but he really does believe it.
[3751.50 --> 3756.94]  And I'm not sure that it's ultimately a compelling or a cogent belief,
[3757.94 --> 3758.08]  right?
[3758.12 --> 3761.82]  Why would he trust his intuition about what is moral?
[3761.98 --> 3764.84]  Why should he trust his intuition about what is moral?
[3765.84 --> 3767.88]  And yet, like we said,
[3768.00 --> 3770.78]  Harris's way of understanding morality in the world
[3770.78 --> 3775.54]  is a form of wisdom that has so much traction in the world today.
[3775.74 --> 3777.64]  And on the surface, right,
[3777.68 --> 3780.58]  it looks very much the same sort of wisdom
[3780.58 --> 3783.10]  because the end results are the same.
[3783.44 --> 3786.14]  People are treated with dignity and respect.
[3787.18 --> 3789.08]  Hopefully, what we will begin to see
[3789.08 --> 3792.24]  is that it's not actually the same.
[3793.78 --> 3798.62]  Now, I really believe that it is only ultimately in relationship to God
[3798.62 --> 3800.50]  and God who created us
[3800.50 --> 3803.48]  that we can begin to make real sense
[3803.48 --> 3807.24]  of these sorts of foundational claims about our reality,
[3807.46 --> 3809.72]  specifically here about our morality.
[3810.66 --> 3813.08]  And that people who don't believe in God
[3813.08 --> 3815.26]  can still come up with ideas
[3815.26 --> 3818.74]  about what is good and what is moral behavior,
[3819.06 --> 3822.74]  what it means to properly believe, behave, and belong.
[3823.54 --> 3825.72]  I think that they are able to do that in the end
[3825.72 --> 3827.68]  because that's just further evidence
[3827.68 --> 3830.10]  of the image of God in them, right?
[3830.10 --> 3833.32]  The imagio dei in all of us is working out,
[3833.46 --> 3835.48]  enabling us to see this reality,
[3835.56 --> 3838.24]  even if we can't name it particularly.
[3839.66 --> 3841.40]  And like I said, this is just one example
[3841.40 --> 3843.50]  where we spent a little bit of time,
[3843.58 --> 3845.76]  but there are countless other ways
[3845.76 --> 3848.70]  that this works out in the world, right?
[3848.74 --> 3852.04]  A wisdom that looks commonplace and normal
[3852.04 --> 3854.56]  that maybe even sounds good and right
[3854.56 --> 3858.24]  ends up ultimately being inadequate or incomplete.
[3858.24 --> 3862.86]  And I really think that in some ways,
[3863.70 --> 3865.92]  the early Christians, in some ways James,
[3866.74 --> 3868.60]  when it comes to this particular distinction,
[3869.14 --> 3870.26]  that they had it easier
[3870.26 --> 3872.76]  because the contrast was just so obvious.
[3873.16 --> 3874.66]  Now, of course, in a number of ways,
[3874.84 --> 3876.42]  the early Christians had it way more difficult
[3876.42 --> 3877.38]  than we have ever had,
[3877.46 --> 3879.10]  and so let's not make that parallel too far.
[3879.88 --> 3881.34]  But the wisdom of heaven
[3881.34 --> 3883.60]  that James is talking about for Christians
[3883.60 --> 3888.16]  is an obvious contrast to the wisdom of Rome, right?
[3888.16 --> 3889.46]  That the culture of the Bible
[3889.46 --> 3891.36]  was alien to the Roman Empire,
[3891.62 --> 3893.40]  but in our day, right,
[3893.48 --> 3896.64]  because we have 2,000 years or so of Christian history
[3896.64 --> 3898.12]  that have shaped language
[3898.12 --> 3900.28]  and has shaped the presumption
[3900.28 --> 3902.20]  of certain virtues or values,
[3902.32 --> 3904.14]  and now we live in a time
[3904.14 --> 3907.38]  where the basic identity of being Christian
[3907.38 --> 3908.42]  might be rejected,
[3908.42 --> 3912.26]  but the basic ideas about being human
[3912.26 --> 3913.90]  are still held onto.
[3915.26 --> 3915.74]  Right?
[3915.78 --> 3917.50]  You can take these things for granted
[3917.50 --> 3920.12]  without requiring them to actually be Christian
[3920.12 --> 3922.10]  or even theistic, requiring a God.
[3923.18 --> 3925.18]  And so on this side of things,
[3925.98 --> 3929.60]  I think this is actually the more insidious side
[3929.60 --> 3933.10]  because Christian culture
[3933.10 --> 3937.54]  has been so closely wedded to Western culture
[3937.54 --> 3938.72]  for so long
[3938.72 --> 3940.62]  that we end up really struggling
[3940.62 --> 3941.58]  to see the difference.
[3943.36 --> 3944.32]  Now let me be clear.
[3944.90 --> 3947.72]  I'm not talking about not-yet-Christians
[3947.72 --> 3949.20]  who struggle to see the difference.
[3950.02 --> 3950.24]  Right?
[3950.28 --> 3952.98]  It is Christians who struggle to see the difference.
[3953.68 --> 3953.80]  Right?
[3953.82 --> 3955.82]  The problem is that we struggle
[3955.82 --> 3958.98]  as Christians to live the difference.
[3959.90 --> 3961.84]  Let me give you an example of this.
[3962.52 --> 3963.88]  If you are a church member,
[3964.38 --> 3965.54]  or if you're a member of the church,
[3965.76 --> 3967.08]  and in fact, I could just stop right there.
[3968.24 --> 3968.42]  Right?
[3968.42 --> 3969.50]  Because that word member,
[3970.12 --> 3973.00]  right, the idea of being a member in a church
[3973.00 --> 3974.92]  is a declining reality in our world.
[3975.22 --> 3977.40]  And I know that some of you watching right now
[3977.40 --> 3980.02]  have consciously made the decision
[3980.02 --> 3981.28]  or refused the decision
[3981.28 --> 3983.84]  to become a member of our church,
[3983.90 --> 3985.78]  to enter into what I prefer to call
[3985.78 --> 3987.48]  covenant relationship to the church body.
[3988.00 --> 3990.72]  But why is it normal in our society?
[3991.28 --> 3993.36]  Why do we just accept that that's the way it is?
[3993.72 --> 3994.56]  And we move on.
[3994.56 --> 3997.22]  But let's keep going.
[3997.86 --> 3999.68]  If you attend a church regularly,
[3999.98 --> 4001.68]  see, I'm not using the language of member anymore.
[4001.96 --> 4003.44]  If you attend the church regularly,
[4003.72 --> 4006.82]  but then that church, for whatever reason, right,
[4006.84 --> 4007.62]  you fill in the gap,
[4007.70 --> 4008.64]  that church stops,
[4008.72 --> 4009.76]  and here's the phrase we always hear,
[4010.02 --> 4011.02]  meeting my needs.
[4012.02 --> 4012.66]  What do you do?
[4012.66 --> 4015.76]  You go shopping for another one.
[4017.12 --> 4017.34]  Right?
[4017.38 --> 4018.74]  Or in the worst case scenario,
[4018.90 --> 4019.98]  you stop going altogether.
[4020.82 --> 4022.08]  And that's just normal.
[4023.08 --> 4023.18]  Right?
[4023.18 --> 4024.96]  The language of church shopping
[4024.96 --> 4027.14]  is just part of our parlance today.
[4027.36 --> 4028.98]  It's the water we swim in,
[4029.36 --> 4031.28]  but it really isn't biblical.
[4032.68 --> 4032.80]  Right?
[4032.82 --> 4034.48]  That's not the wisdom of heaven.
[4034.56 --> 4036.40]  That's another wisdom.
[4036.40 --> 4038.60]  And yet, as Christians,
[4039.06 --> 4041.58]  we live by it without any serious reflection.
[4042.84 --> 4042.96]  Right?
[4043.00 --> 4043.42]  On and on,
[4043.48 --> 4045.92]  these sorts of contrasts can go.
[4046.66 --> 4049.20]  If we have the spiritual sense to discern it,
[4049.60 --> 4050.56]  we can see it.
[4051.12 --> 4051.26]  Right?
[4051.32 --> 4053.12]  And the world will tell us
[4053.12 --> 4055.04]  to find your bliss.
[4055.70 --> 4055.86]  Right?
[4055.90 --> 4057.16]  To do what you love.
[4057.26 --> 4058.58]  To follow your joy.
[4058.58 --> 4061.04]  The Bible says
[4061.04 --> 4062.86]  it's about a long obedience
[4062.86 --> 4064.68]  in the same direction.
[4065.40 --> 4066.70]  The Bible says that in this world,
[4066.86 --> 4067.66]  you will have trouble,
[4067.78 --> 4068.94]  that life will be hard,
[4069.02 --> 4070.42]  and it will be full of suffering.
[4070.82 --> 4072.46]  But the reward is great.
[4072.84 --> 4074.28]  The joy of the glory of God
[4074.28 --> 4076.02]  and the new Jerusalem come down
[4076.02 --> 4077.46]  is better than anything
[4077.46 --> 4078.78]  that this world has to offer.
[4080.80 --> 4081.88]  And yet, how many of us
[4081.88 --> 4084.32]  really do want to follow our bliss?
[4084.98 --> 4085.58]  Whatever that means.
[4086.40 --> 4086.52]  Right?
[4086.54 --> 4087.88]  In a world that tells us
[4087.88 --> 4089.54]  to look out for number one,
[4089.66 --> 4091.20]  to pull up yourself
[4091.20 --> 4092.48]  by your bootstraps,
[4092.54 --> 4094.10]  that if you don't look out for you,
[4094.22 --> 4095.92]  no one will look out for you.
[4096.00 --> 4097.50]  The Bible comes along and says,
[4097.78 --> 4099.02]  love your neighbor as yourself.
[4099.48 --> 4100.36]  Love your enemy.
[4101.30 --> 4101.46]  Right?
[4101.50 --> 4102.50]  The Bible comes along and says,
[4102.72 --> 4103.64]  don't think of yourself
[4103.64 --> 4105.12]  more highly than you ought,
[4105.24 --> 4106.52]  but rather, in humility,
[4106.68 --> 4108.88]  value others above yourselves.
[4108.92 --> 4110.42]  Not looking out to your own interests,
[4110.52 --> 4111.24]  but each of you
[4111.24 --> 4113.56]  to the interests of others.
[4113.56 --> 4118.30]  How you live in the world
[4118.30 --> 4120.12]  will be determined
[4120.12 --> 4122.80]  by the wisdom about the world
[4122.80 --> 4125.92]  you hold as true.
[4127.70 --> 4129.36]  You have the wisdom of heaven
[4129.36 --> 4133.34]  or you have the wisdom of this world.
[4134.34 --> 4135.46]  You can decide.
[4136.24 --> 4138.16]  But there is a war going on
[4138.16 --> 4139.66]  for your mind.
[4139.66 --> 4141.06]  There is a war going on
[4141.06 --> 4142.24]  for how you believe,
[4142.44 --> 4143.38]  behave, and belong.
[4144.52 --> 4145.22]  This is it.
[4146.78 --> 4147.62]  Let me tell you,
[4147.64 --> 4148.92]  and I'll leave it here
[4148.92 --> 4150.50]  with this last idea.
[4151.66 --> 4152.30]  The beauty,
[4152.68 --> 4155.70]  the beauty of the wisdom of heaven
[4155.70 --> 4157.28]  is precisely
[4157.28 --> 4160.32]  that it doesn't stay in heaven.
[4161.64 --> 4162.76]  I love this line
[4162.76 --> 4165.28]  from 1 Corinthians chapter 1,
[4165.36 --> 4166.26]  and it's going to be on the screen,
[4166.34 --> 4166.76]  but if you want,
[4166.82 --> 4167.52]  you can turn to it.
[4167.52 --> 4168.84]  1 Corinthians chapter 1.
[4170.26 --> 4171.64]  I'll start at verse 20.
[4173.42 --> 4174.98]  Paul is writing to this church
[4174.98 --> 4175.60]  who is known
[4175.60 --> 4177.32]  for its wisdom
[4177.32 --> 4178.96]  and its philosophical education,
[4179.22 --> 4180.10]  to a culture that was
[4180.10 --> 4182.04]  prizing those sorts of things,
[4182.08 --> 4182.78]  and he says,
[4183.34 --> 4184.80]  Where is the wise person?
[4185.24 --> 4186.58]  Where is the teacher of the law?
[4186.70 --> 4188.84]  Where is the philosopher of this age?
[4189.18 --> 4190.76]  Has not God made foolish
[4190.76 --> 4192.32]  the wisdom of the world?
[4192.62 --> 4194.72]  For since in the wisdom of God,
[4194.82 --> 4196.42]  the world through its wisdom
[4196.42 --> 4197.36]  did not know him,
[4197.36 --> 4198.68]  God was pleased
[4198.68 --> 4199.92]  through the foolishness
[4199.92 --> 4200.92]  of what was preached
[4200.92 --> 4202.68]  to save those who believed.
[4202.68 --> 4204.00]  Jews demanded signs,
[4204.14 --> 4205.20]  and Greeks looked for wisdom,
[4205.48 --> 4207.64]  but we preach Christ crucified,
[4207.96 --> 4209.32]  a stumbling block to the Jews
[4209.32 --> 4210.86]  and foolishness to the Gentiles,
[4210.96 --> 4213.74]  but to those whom God has called,
[4213.84 --> 4215.26]  both Jews and Greeks,
[4215.66 --> 4217.38]  Christ, the power of God,
[4217.44 --> 4217.96]  and hear it,
[4218.40 --> 4218.82]  Christ,
[4219.64 --> 4220.46]  the wisdom
[4220.46 --> 4222.18]  of God.
[4224.02 --> 4225.02]  See, the great,
[4225.34 --> 4226.86]  unique,
[4227.82 --> 4229.54]  gospel reality
[4229.54 --> 4231.40]  that is ours as Christians
[4231.40 --> 4232.82]  is that the wisdom of heaven
[4232.82 --> 4234.86]  did not stay in heaven,
[4235.00 --> 4236.38]  but that the wisdom of God
[4236.38 --> 4237.64]  took on flesh
[4237.64 --> 4238.28]  and came
[4238.28 --> 4241.46]  and made his dwelling among us,
[4241.62 --> 4242.96]  and that in Jesus Christ
[4242.96 --> 4244.18]  we have seen the glory
[4244.18 --> 4245.16]  of the one and only come
[4245.16 --> 4245.68]  from the Father,
[4245.78 --> 4247.60]  full of truth and grace.
[4247.60 --> 4249.22]  In Jesus Christ,
[4249.32 --> 4250.52]  we have seen the wisdom
[4250.52 --> 4253.08]  of God made flesh.
[4254.04 --> 4255.52]  Christ is the wisdom
[4255.52 --> 4256.44]  of God,
[4256.54 --> 4257.62]  and the wisdom of God
[4257.62 --> 4259.96]  came down to us.
[4261.24 --> 4263.14]  Jesus lived the life
[4263.14 --> 4264.78]  we should have lived
[4264.78 --> 4265.84]  and died the death
[4265.84 --> 4267.12]  that we deserve,
[4268.18 --> 4268.78]  and that Jesus,
[4269.46 --> 4271.58]  shattering all expectations
[4271.58 --> 4273.96]  of reality three days later,
[4273.96 --> 4276.28]  was raised from the dead,
[4276.50 --> 4277.86]  and now has victory
[4277.86 --> 4279.04]  over sin and death,
[4279.24 --> 4280.36]  now has proven
[4280.36 --> 4281.84]  that the foolishness
[4281.84 --> 4283.60]  of God
[4283.60 --> 4284.66]  is greater
[4284.66 --> 4286.00]  than the wisdom
[4286.00 --> 4288.14]  of man.
[4288.94 --> 4289.78]  The gospel
[4289.78 --> 4291.64]  of Jesus Christ,
[4291.74 --> 4292.78]  the truth of Jesus
[4292.78 --> 4293.66]  and the truths
[4293.66 --> 4294.30]  of Jesus
[4294.30 --> 4295.66]  are the wisdom
[4295.66 --> 4296.96]  by which we can
[4296.96 --> 4297.58]  finally,
[4298.44 --> 4298.88]  ultimately,
[4299.66 --> 4300.14]  only,
[4301.02 --> 4302.10]  make sense of the world.
[4302.10 --> 4304.48]  that's wisdom.
[4305.32 --> 4305.94]  And that
[4305.94 --> 4308.06]  is what I would
[4308.06 --> 4308.96]  encourage you
[4308.96 --> 4311.48]  to drink deeply of.
[4311.98 --> 4312.76]  Drink deeply
[4312.76 --> 4313.86]  the wisdom
[4313.86 --> 4315.08]  of God
[4315.08 --> 4316.38]  in Jesus Christ.
[4317.42 --> 4317.74]  Reap
[4317.74 --> 4318.82]  the blessing
[4318.82 --> 4319.76]  of life
[4319.76 --> 4321.14]  lived in.
[4321.50 --> 4321.88]  Amen.
[4321.88 --> 4322.02]  Amen.
[4327.32 --> 4328.30]  Let's pray together.
[4332.10 --> 4333.62]  Lord Jesus,
[4334.12 --> 4336.70]  you are
[4336.70 --> 4338.62]  our wisdom.
[4339.98 --> 4341.08]  Lord Jesus,
[4341.72 --> 4343.60]  in your word,
[4344.12 --> 4345.26]  reveal truth
[4345.26 --> 4346.80]  about the world.
[4347.66 --> 4349.36]  In our lives,
[4350.04 --> 4351.00]  may we live
[4351.00 --> 4351.80]  in accordance
[4351.80 --> 4354.26]  with that truth.
[4355.56 --> 4356.40]  As we enter
[4356.40 --> 4357.20]  and live
[4357.20 --> 4357.76]  in the midst
[4357.76 --> 4359.46]  of this wisdom war
[4359.46 --> 4360.80]  for our being
[4360.80 --> 4361.58]  in the world,
[4362.50 --> 4363.20]  we pray,
[4363.56 --> 4364.64]  reveal yourself
[4364.64 --> 4365.82]  to us.
[4365.94 --> 4366.84]  Transform how we
[4366.84 --> 4368.04]  behave and believe
[4368.04 --> 4368.82]  and belong
[4368.82 --> 4369.94]  so that we
[4369.94 --> 4370.90]  can live
[4370.90 --> 4371.66]  the wisdom
[4371.66 --> 4373.10]  of heaven.
[4373.94 --> 4374.68]  Christ alone,
[4374.80 --> 4375.18]  we pray.
[4375.90 --> 4376.36]  Amen.
[4376.36 --> 4376.50]  Amen.
[4376.50 --> 4376.52]  Amen.
[4376.52 --> 4376.54]  Amen.
[4376.54 --> 4376.56]  Amen.
[4376.56 --> 4376.58]  Amen.
[4376.58 --> 4378.58]  Amen.
[4378.58 --> 4380.52]  Amen.
[4380.52 --> 4380.58]  Amen.
[4380.58 --> 4380.62]  Amen.
[4380.62 --> 4382.52]  Amen.
[4382.52 --> 4382.58]  Amen.
[4382.58 --> 4384.58]  Amen.
[4384.58 --> 4384.64]  Amen.
[4384.64 --> 4386.58]  Amen.
[4386.58 --> 4386.64]  Amen.
[4386.64 --> 4386.70]  Amen.
[4386.70 --> 4386.74]  Amen.
[4386.74 --> 4386.78]  Amen.
[4386.78 --> 4388.70]  Amen.
[4388.70 --> 4388.78]  Amen.
[4389.46 --> 4406.24]  In Christ alone
[4406.24 --> 4409.86]  my hope is found,
[4410.30 --> 4412.00]  He is my light,
[4412.10 --> 4412.96]  my strength,
[4414.20 --> 4415.66]  my song.
[4416.42 --> 4418.72]  This cornerstone
[4418.72 --> 4422.10]  This solid ground
[4422.10 --> 4427.56]  Firm through the fiercest drought and storm
[4427.56 --> 4433.56]  What heights above, what depths of peace
[4433.56 --> 4439.40]  When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
[4439.40 --> 4445.84]  My comforter, my all in all
[4445.84 --> 4451.84]  Here is the love of Christ I stand
[4451.84 --> 4468.78]  In Christ alone, who took on flesh
[4468.78 --> 4474.06]  Flawless of God in helpless pain
[4474.06 --> 4479.16]  This gift of love and righteousness
[4479.16 --> 4485.06]  Scorned by the ones He came to save
[4485.74 --> 4491.06]  Till on that cross as Jesus died
[4491.06 --> 4497.06]  The wrath of God was satisfied
[4497.06 --> 4503.06]  For every sin on Him was laid
[4503.06 --> 4509.06]  Here in the death of Christ I lay
[4509.06 --> 4527.06]  There in the ground His body lay
[4527.06 --> 4533.06]  Light of the world by darkness slain
[4533.06 --> 4538.06]  Then bursting forth in glorious day
[4538.06 --> 4544.06]  Up from the grave He rose again
[4544.06 --> 4549.06]  And as He stands in victory
[4549.06 --> 4555.06]  Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
[4555.06 --> 4561.06]  For I am His and He is mine
[4561.06 --> 4568.06]  Bought with the precious blood of Christ
[4568.06 --> 4585.06]  No guilt in life, no fear in death
[4585.06 --> 4590.06]  This is the power of Christ in me
[4590.06 --> 4597.06]  From life's first cry to final breath
[4597.06 --> 4601.06]  Jesus commands my destiny
[4601.06 --> 4602.06]  No power of hell, no scheme of man
[4602.06 --> 4604.06]  No power of hell, no scheme of man
[4604.06 --> 4608.06]  No power of hell, no scheme of man
[4608.06 --> 4610.06]  Can ever pluck me from His hand
[4610.06 --> 4615.06]  Can ever pluck me from His hand
[4615.06 --> 4619.06]  Till He returns, no sense of man
[4619.06 --> 4622.06]  Can ever pluck me from His hand
[4622.06 --> 4623.06]  Till He returns, or calls me home
[4623.06 --> 4626.06]  Here in the power of Christ I'll stand
[4626.06 --> 4629.06]  No power of hell, no scheme of man
[4629.06 --> 4630.06]  Can ever pluck me from His hand
[4630.06 --> 4632.06]  No scheme of man
[4632.06 --> 4636.06]  Can ever pluck me from His hand
[4636.06 --> 4642.06]  Till He returns, or calls me home
[4642.06 --> 4649.06]  Here in the power of Christ I'll stand
[4649.06 --> 4666.06]  As you go this week, go in the wisdom of our God
[4666.06 --> 4672.06]  Who goes with us, receive His blessing for that journey
[4672.06 --> 4678.06]  Before I give the blessing to whomever it was that came and dropped off a treat tag
[4678.06 --> 4681.06]  Here during our worship service, thank you so much
[4681.06 --> 4686.06]  The fact that the treat tag also included a stick for Hank is amazing
[4687.06 --> 4689.06]  Go this week with God
[4689.06 --> 4692.06]  May God go before you to lead you
[4692.06 --> 4695.06]  May God go behind you to guard you
[4695.06 --> 4697.06]  May God go beneath you to support you
[4697.06 --> 4700.06]  May God go beside you to befriend you
[4700.06 --> 4702.06]  Do not be afraid
[4702.06 --> 4705.06]  Let the blessing of God come upon you today
[4705.06 --> 4707.06]  Do not be afraid
[4707.06 --> 4709.06]  Go in peace
[4709.06 --> 4712.06]  In the wisdom of God
[4712.06 --> 4715.06]  To love and serve the Lord
[4715.06 --> 4716.06]  Amen
[4716.06 --> 4717.06]  Amen
[4717.06 --> 4728.06]  I cast my mind to Calvary
[4728.06 --> 4738.06]  Where Jesus bled and died for me
[4738.06 --> 4740.06]  I see His wounds
[4740.06 --> 4742.06]  I see His wounds
[4742.06 --> 4746.06]  His hands His feet
[4746.06 --> 4754.06]  My Savior of that cursed tree
[4754.06 --> 4766.06]  His body bound and drenched in tears
[4766.06 --> 4768.06]  They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb
[4768.06 --> 4772.06]  They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb
[4772.06 --> 4782.06]  The entrance sealed by heavy stone
[4782.06 --> 4788.06]  Messiah still and all alone
[4788.06 --> 4790.06]  And all alone
[4790.06 --> 4792.06]  Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God
[4792.06 --> 4795.06]  Oh, praise His name
[4795.06 --> 4799.06]  Oh, praise His name
[4799.06 --> 4801.06]  Of the Lord our God
[4801.06 --> 4803.06]  Oh, praise His name
[4803.06 --> 4805.06]  Oh, praise His name
[4805.06 --> 4807.06]  Oh, praise His name
[4807.06 --> 4810.06]  Oh, praise His name
[4810.06 --> 4811.06]  Oh, praise His name
[4811.06 --> 4813.06]  Oh, praise His name
[4813.06 --> 4829.06]  For endless days we will sing your praise, O Lord, O Lord our God.
[4829.06 --> 4846.84]  And on the third, at break of dawn, the Son of Heaven rose again.
[4846.84 --> 4854.62]  O trampled death, where is your sting?
[4854.62 --> 4863.10]  The angels roar for Christ the King.
[4865.50 --> 4874.40]  O praise the name of the Lord our God.
[4874.40 --> 4881.40]  O praise His name forevermore.
[4882.18 --> 4895.28]  For endless days we will sing your praise, O Lord, O Lord our God.
[4895.28 --> 4902.28]  O praise His name forever.
[4902.28 --> 4916.42]  In robes of white, the blazing sun shall pierce the night.
[4916.42 --> 4935.40]  And I will rise among the saints, My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face.
[4935.40 --> 4950.40]  O praise His name forever.
[4950.40 --> 4957.40]  O praise His name forever.
[4957.40 --> 4964.40]  O praise His name forevermore.
[4964.40 --> 4969.40]  O praise His name forevermore.
[4969.40 --> 4976.40]  O praise His name forevermore.
[4976.40 --> 4978.40]  O praise His name forevermore.
[4978.40 --> 4982.40]  O praise His name forevermore.
[4982.40 --> 4994.78]  O praise His name forevermore.
[4994.78 --> 4996.24]  O praise His name forevermore.
[4996.24 --> 5001.38]  O praise His name forevermore.
[5001.38 --> 5008.96]  Of the Lord our God, O praise His name.
[5011.46 --> 5019.92]  Forevermore, for endless days, we will sing Your praise.
[5019.92 --> 5025.92]  O Lord, O Lord our God.
[5025.92 --> 5032.82]  O Lord, O Lord our God.
[5034.68 --> 5040.80]  O Lord, O Lord our God.
[5055.92 --> 5070.68]  O Lord, O Lord our God.
[5070.68 --> 5083.06]  Holy Spirit, fall on us.
[5083.06 --> 5093.54]  Burn like a fire.
[5094.60 --> 5101.12]  Living flame of love.
[5101.12 --> 5121.16]  Come, Holy Spirit.
[5121.16 --> 5151.14]  Come, Holy Spirit.
[5151.14 --> 5153.14]  Come, Holy Spirit.
[5153.14 --> 5155.02]  Come, Holy Spirit.
[5155.02 --> 5156.72]  Come, Holy Spirit.
[5158.30 --> 5162.66]  Show us Your glory.
[5162.66 --> 5171.12]  God, we are on our knees.
[5171.12 --> 5180.88]  Crying forever to come to earth
[5180.88 --> 5194.46]  Come Holy Spirit
[5194.46 --> 5203.10]  You live forever
[5203.10 --> 5205.10]  Like a fire
[5205.10 --> 5214.46]  Like a fire
[5214.46 --> 5223.10]  Living forever
[5224.46 --> 5228.84]  Father God, your will be done
[5228.84 --> 5233.44]  Christ in us, your kingdom come
[5233.44 --> 5238.16]  Spirit lead us now as one
[5238.16 --> 5242.46]  Set your church on fire again
[5242.46 --> 5243.14]  Sing that with us
[5243.14 --> 5247.38]  Father God, your will be done
[5247.38 --> 5251.64]  Christ in us, your kingdom come
[5251.64 --> 5256.58]  Spirit lead us now as one
[5256.58 --> 5260.62]  Set your church on fire again
[5260.62 --> 5265.42]  Father God, your will be done
[5265.42 --> 5270.02]  Christ in us, your kingdom come
[5270.02 --> 5274.62]  Spirit lead us now as one
[5274.62 --> 5283.60]  Set your church on fire again
[5283.60 --> 5286.00]  Come Holy Spirit
[5286.00 --> 5289.00]  Come Holy Spirit
[5289.00 --> 5293.00]  Come Holy Spirit
[5293.00 --> 5293.60]  Set your church on fire again
[5293.60 --> 5295.60]  Come Holy Spirit
[5295.60 --> 5304.58]  Come Holy Spirit
[5304.58 --> 5307.58]  Come Holy Spirit
[5307.58 --> 5314.58]  Come Holy Spirit
[5314.58 --> 5318.56]  He reigns now as one
[5318.56 --> 5319.52]  Am Holy Spirit
[5319.52 --> 5320.14]  Ele constantly
[5320.14 --> 5332.96]  Is y'all
[5332.96 --> 5334.14]  Jesus definitely
[5334.14 --> 5336.12]  He reigns now as one
[5336.12 --> 5339.56]  Yes, we're not
[5339.56 --> 5350.30]  Living flame, living flame of love.
[5350.30 --> 5352.94]  Sing our living flame.
[5352.94 --> 5354.94]  Living flame.
[5364.46 --> 5368.54]  Living flame of love.
[5369.56 --> 5379.56]  Yes, you are the living flame of love.
[5379.56 --> 5386.52]  Living flame of love.
[5386.52 --> 5392.58]  Living flame of love.
