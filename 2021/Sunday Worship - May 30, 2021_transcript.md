[0.00 --> 2.00]  I'll cry like this
[2.00 --> 10.00]  Oh, I've never known love like this, no, no
[10.00 --> 13.00]  No, no, no, no, no, no
[13.00 --> 18.00]  Don't have to stir it up
[18.00 --> 21.34]  I'm already good enough
[21.34 --> 24.68]  No, I can't under up
[24.68 --> 29.06]  It's running, it's running, it's running, it's running for me
[29.06 --> 31.34]  Don't have to stir it up
[31.34 --> 35.26]  I'm already good enough
[35.26 --> 38.02]  No, I can't under up
[38.02 --> 42.36]  It's running, it's running, it's running, it's running for me
[42.36 --> 44.72]  Don't have to stir it up
[44.72 --> 48.00]  I'm already good enough
[48.00 --> 51.34]  No, I can't under up
[51.60 --> 55.74]  It's running, it's running, it's running, it's running for me
[55.74 --> 58.00]  Don't have to stir it up
[58.00 --> 61.38]  I'm already good enough
[61.38 --> 64.86]  No one can hurt your love
[64.86 --> 67.58]  It's running, it's running, it's running
[67.58 --> 68.46]  It's running
[68.46 --> 70.04]  Love like this
[70.04 --> 71.70]  Love like this
[71.70 --> 73.46]  Love like this
[73.46 --> 75.06]  Love like this
[75.06 --> 78.04]  I've never known about what I like
[78.04 --> 81.34]  I've never known about what I like
[81.34 --> 83.40]  Love like this
[83.40 --> 85.06]  Love like this
[85.06 --> 86.12]  Love like this
[86.12 --> 88.12]  Oh
[105.26 --> 107.26]  raised
[116.12 --> 146.10]  I'll never know a love quite like this
[146.12 --> 176.10]  I'll never know a love quite like this
[176.12 --> 206.10]  I'll never know a love quite like this
[206.10 --> 211.74]  You know what I need before I even have to think
[211.74 --> 241.74] 
[241.74 --> 244.40]  Or the shadow would cast
[244.40 --> 248.06]  A heart that's planning in forgiveness
[248.06 --> 251.74]  Doesn't dwell in the past
[251.74 --> 255.88]  So why should I be?
[256.98 --> 259.78]  Cause you take good care of me
[259.78 --> 263.22]  You take good care of me
[263.22 --> 270.02]  And you know what I need before I even ask a thing
[270.02 --> 273.54]  And you hold me in your hand
[273.54 --> 277.24]  With the kindness that never is
[277.24 --> 280.32]  I'm carried in your love
[280.32 --> 284.10]  No matter what the future brings
[284.10 --> 287.24]  Yeah, you take good care of me
[287.24 --> 303.58]  I know there must be more
[303.58 --> 307.08]  But I can't get past your kindness
[307.08 --> 310.34]  I know there's got to be more
[310.34 --> 313.94]  But I can't get past your goodness
[313.94 --> 317.18]  I know there must be more
[317.18 --> 320.76]  But I can't get past your kindness
[320.76 --> 321.76]  I know there must be more
[321.76 --> 322.76]  I know there must be more
[322.76 --> 323.76]  I know there must be more
[323.76 --> 327.76]  But I can't get past your goodness
[327.76 --> 334.76]  You take good care of me
[334.76 --> 336.76]  You take good care of me
[336.76 --> 338.42]  You take good care of me
[338.42 --> 344.76]  You know what I need before I even have to think
[344.76 --> 345.76]  You hold me in your hand
[345.76 --> 346.76]  You hold me in your hand
[346.76 --> 348.76]  You hold me in your hand
[348.76 --> 351.76]  You take kindness that never ends
[352.44 --> 354.76]  I'm carried in your love
[355.74 --> 358.76]  No matter what the future brings
[359.52 --> 362.76]  Oh, you take good care of me
[362.76 --> 383.76]  What is our hope in life and death?
[383.76 --> 388.76]  Christ alone, Christ alone
[388.76 --> 393.76]  What is our only confidence
[393.76 --> 397.76]  That our souls to Him belong
[397.76 --> 402.76]  Who holds our days within His hand
[402.76 --> 407.76]  What comes apart from His command
[407.76 --> 412.76]  And what will keep us to the end
[412.76 --> 419.76]  The love of Christ in which we stand?
[419.76 --> 424.76]  Oh, sing hallelujah
[424.76 --> 429.76]  Our hope springs eternal
[429.76 --> 433.76]  Oh, sing hallelujah
[433.76 --> 437.76]  Now and ever we confess
[437.76 --> 444.76]  Christ our hope in life and death
[448.76 --> 452.76]  What truth can calm the troubled soul
[452.76 --> 457.76]  God is good, God is good
[457.76 --> 462.76]  Where is His grace and goodness known?
[462.76 --> 467.76]  In our great Redeemer's blood
[467.76 --> 472.76]  Who holds our faith when fears arise?
[472.76 --> 476.76]  Who stands above the stormy tribe?
[477.76 --> 481.76]  Who sends the waves that bring us nigh
[481.76 --> 486.76]  Unto the shore of the rock of Christ?
[486.76 --> 491.76]  Oh, sing hallelujah
[491.76 --> 495.76]  Our hope springs eternal
[496.76 --> 500.76]  Oh, sing hallelujah
[500.76 --> 502.76]  Now and ever we confess
[502.76 --> 507.76]  Christ our hope in life and death
[507.76 --> 509.76]  We sing
[509.76 --> 512.76]  Christ he lives, Christ he lives
[512.76 --> 514.76]  And what reward will heaven bring?
[514.76 --> 516.76]  Everlasting life with Him
[516.76 --> 518.76]  There we will rise
[518.76 --> 519.76]  And what reward will heaven bring?
[519.76 --> 520.76]  Everlasting life with Him
[520.76 --> 525.76]  There we will rise to meet the Lord
[525.76 --> 529.76]  And sin and death will be destroyed
[529.76 --> 534.76]  And we will feast in endless joy
[534.76 --> 537.76]  When Christ is ours forevermore
[537.76 --> 539.76]  Forevermore
[539.76 --> 541.76]  Forevermore
[541.76 --> 546.76]  Oh, sing hallelujah
[546.76 --> 551.76]  Our hope springs eternal
[551.76 --> 556.76]  Oh, sing hallelujah
[556.76 --> 558.76]  Now and ever we confess
[558.76 --> 559.76]  Oh, sing hallelujah
[559.76 --> 561.76]  Now and ever we confess
[561.76 --> 564.76]  Christ our hope in life and death
[564.76 --> 566.76]  Oh, sing hallelujah
[566.76 --> 567.76]  Now and ever we confess
[567.76 --> 569.76]  Oh, sing hallelujah
[569.76 --> 570.76]  Now and ever we confess
[570.76 --> 573.76]  Now and ever we confess
[573.76 --> 577.76]  Christ our hope in life and death
[577.76 --> 579.76]  Oh, sing hallelujah
[579.76 --> 583.76]  Oh, sing hallelujah
[583.76 --> 587.76]  Our hope springs eternal
[587.76 --> 592.76]  Oh, sing hallelujah
[592.76 --> 595.76]  Now and ever we confess
[595.76 --> 600.76]  Christ our hope in life and death
[600.76 --> 601.76]  Now and ever we confess
[601.76 --> 605.76]  Christ our hope in life and death
[605.76 --> 610.76]  Christ our hope in life and death
[625.76 --> 637.76]  You saw me first
[641.76 --> 643.76]  Welcome to worship.
[643.76 --> 646.76]  We want to welcome everybody who is here with us
[646.76 --> 649.76]  for our first regathered worship service
[649.76 --> 652.76]  and we want to welcome everybody who is joining us online
[652.76 --> 653.76]  And whether you're watching it now
[653.76 --> 655.76]  or if you came at 10 o'clock
[655.76 --> 657.76]  and you're wondering why is the service almost over
[657.76 --> 660.76]  It's because we changed the start time to 9 o'clock
[660.76 --> 662.76]  or if you're watching it later today or later in the week
[662.76 --> 665.76]  we are glad that you are worshiping with us this morning
[665.76 --> 667.76]  Before we begin in earnest
[667.76 --> 670.76]  there are a couple announcements that I'm going to make
[670.76 --> 674.76]  First, tonight for the youth group there is 20-20
[674.76 --> 677.76]  and so you or your parents should have received an email about that
[677.76 --> 680.76]  and that begins here at 7 o'clock
[680.76 --> 682.76]  If you have any questions you can grab Pastor Kevin
[682.76 --> 685.76]  or email Pastor Kevin and figure that out
[685.76 --> 687.76]  That is tonight
[687.76 --> 692.76]  Also, as we are beginning this process of regathering our worship together
[692.76 --> 697.76]  we also are very hopeful that we will be able to transition back
[697.76 --> 702.76]  or restart the children's worship time ministry of our gathered worship
[702.76 --> 705.76]  But in order to do that we need volunteers
[705.76 --> 714.76]  And so we are looking for people to volunteer to lead preschools to grade 4
[714.76 --> 715.76]  Right?
[715.76 --> 717.76]  As we have two groups for children's worship time
[717.76 --> 719.76]  And so if that's something you've done in the past
[719.76 --> 721.76]  and you're looking for something to do
[721.76 --> 724.76]  for the next couple weeks and months of our time together
[724.76 --> 728.76]  then please reach out to Nikki and touch base with her
[728.76 --> 731.76]  If that's something you haven't done in the past
[731.76 --> 733.76]  but you're still looking for something to do
[733.76 --> 734.76]  and you want to bless our community
[734.76 --> 738.76]  please think seriously about being able to do that here
[738.76 --> 741.76]  and provide that for parents who are coming
[741.76 --> 744.76]  and young families who are coming to worship
[744.76 --> 749.76]  I'm speaking only on behalf of my lovely wife
[749.76 --> 753.76]  who has to single parent while I get to be here every week at Sunday
[753.76 --> 755.76]  and so when it comes time for her to come with the kids
[755.76 --> 757.76]  it would be a real blessing
[757.76 --> 760.76]  if we had an opportunity to bless those kids in worship
[760.76 --> 762.76]  so that she could also focus
[762.76 --> 766.76]  and people like that situation can focus in our worship together
[766.76 --> 769.76]  and so please, please, please think seriously
[769.76 --> 775.76]  about whether or not you feel God calling you to serve our community in that way
[775.76 --> 778.76]  Oh, one second, hold on
[778.76 --> 782.76]  I'm getting something in my earbud here
[792.76 --> 797.76]  Good morning and welcome to this morning's edition of the 10am Emanuel Missions Committee News
[797.76 --> 799.76]  I'm your host, Rebecca Pullman
[799.76 --> 803.76]  Today's breaking news includes the story of a local food drive
[803.76 --> 807.76]  the Missions Committee is encouraging people from Langley Emanuel CRC
[807.76 --> 809.76]  to support their local food bank
[809.76 --> 812.76]  by purchasing much needed food and household items
[812.76 --> 815.76]  with more on this story, our reporter in the field, Susan Stam
[815.76 --> 817.76]  what more can you tell us, Susan?
[817.76 --> 818.76]  Thanks, Rebecca
[818.76 --> 821.76]  As you've heard, the Langley Food Bank serves the community
[821.76 --> 824.76]  providing food and household items to families in need
[824.76 --> 828.76]  Emanuel CRC is prepared to help them by holding a food drive
[828.76 --> 830.76]  however, this isn't just any food drive
[830.76 --> 832.76]  it's a food competition
[832.76 --> 833.76]  within the church
[833.76 --> 836.76]  members are divided into elder districts
[836.76 --> 838.76]  these districts will compete against each other
[838.76 --> 842.76]  to see which group can provide the most support for the Langley Food Bank
[842.76 --> 844.76]  and I hear there's a prize on the line
[844.76 --> 845.76]  it's a feisty competition
[845.76 --> 847.76]  and I'm actually here on the ground
[847.76 --> 849.76]  with the presumed front-runner team
[849.76 --> 851.76]  led by none other than Ken Stam
[851.76 --> 855.76]  Ken, can you tell me how you're planning on motivating your district?
[855.76 --> 859.76]  Well, you know, I feel that we don't need a whole lot of motivation
[859.76 --> 862.76]  I feel like, you know, for the last year and a little bit
[862.76 --> 864.76]  we've sort of been sitting around, you know, just preparing
[864.76 --> 865.76]  preparing for this moment
[865.76 --> 867.76]  and I feel like, you know, we're pretty amped up
[867.76 --> 870.76]  ready to just jump out and, you know, really give
[870.76 --> 872.76]  Hold on here, so let's go on
[872.76 --> 873.76]  No, no, no, so
[873.76 --> 874.76]  What's going on here?
[874.76 --> 875.76]  What's going on?
[875.76 --> 877.76]  Wait a minute, it looks like we might have another challenger here
[877.76 --> 878.76]  This is Eric Van Heusen
[878.76 --> 880.76]  What district are you?
[880.76 --> 881.76]  Well, we're in district one
[881.76 --> 884.76]  and what's Ken trying to tell you guys right now?
[884.76 --> 886.76]  What are you trying to tell us, Ken?
[886.76 --> 889.76]  I'm trying to tell you that we got this thing in the bag
[889.76 --> 892.76]  and we're going to come out on top here, okay?
[892.76 --> 894.76]  Sorry, folks, folks, sorry
[894.76 --> 895.76]  I just got to say a couple things
[895.76 --> 898.76]  like Ken here suffers from a condition called overconfidence
[898.76 --> 900.76]  and he's kind of like the Edmonton Oilers
[900.76 --> 903.76]  that just kind of lost last night in the playoffs
[903.76 --> 905.76]  so we're more like district one
[905.76 --> 906.76]  we're more like the Winnipeg Jets
[906.76 --> 907.76]  we're just going to plug along here
[907.76 --> 909.76]  and win this competition, no problem
[909.76 --> 913.76]  Well, there you have it, Langley, Emanuel lights
[913.76 --> 915.76]  looks like it's going to be a tough competition
[915.76 --> 916.76]  back to you, Rebecca
[916.76 --> 918.76]  Thank you, Susan
[918.76 --> 919.76]  There you have it, folks
[919.76 --> 922.76]  It seems like this food drive will certainly be an exciting way
[922.76 --> 925.76]  to bless a much needed organization in our community
[925.76 --> 928.76]  Elder districts will have two weeks to collect items
[928.76 --> 930.76]  with donations to be dropped off at the church
[930.76 --> 932.76]  on Saturday, June 12th
[932.76 --> 934.76]  Times for each district drop off
[934.76 --> 936.76]  as well as a list of the most needed items
[936.76 --> 938.76]  can be found in this week's bulletin
[938.76 --> 940.76]  as well as the mid-week memo
[940.76 --> 942.76]  We'll be back next time with an update
[942.76 --> 944.76]  on the food drive competition
[944.76 --> 945.76]  I'm Rebecca Pullman
[945.76 --> 948.76]  and from all of us at Langley Emanuel CRC
[948.76 --> 950.76]  and we'll see you, have a great day
[950.76 --> 956.76]  music
[958.76 --> 961.76]  I think Ken and Eric had too much fun with that
[961.76 --> 963.76]  and I think that they have been wanting to be hockey players
[963.76 --> 965.76]  and a postgame interview since they were little boys
[965.76 --> 970.56]  and I think that they have been wanting to be hockey players in a post-game interview
[970.56 --> 972.02]  since they were little boys.
[974.18 --> 978.26]  There is more information on that food drive that is available to you in your e-bulletins
[978.26 --> 981.58]  and will be available in the midweek memo, so I encourage you to check that out
[981.58 --> 985.52]  and to represent your district well in this competition
[985.52 --> 990.10]  and we will see and anticipate the prizes that will be offered there.
[990.54 --> 993.08]  We're going to come in together to worship our God
[993.08 --> 995.32]  and so as you're able, I'm going to invite you to stand
[995.32 --> 999.12]  and maybe open your hands or at minimum open your heart
[999.12 --> 1001.76]  to receive the greeting of our God.
[1005.18 --> 1009.98]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father,
[1009.98 --> 1013.04]  from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Savior
[1013.04 --> 1016.10]  through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[1017.30 --> 1017.72]  Amen.
[1018.42 --> 1019.58]  Let's worship God together.
[1019.58 --> 1026.34]  Good morning and welcome to worship, be it online or in person.
[1026.96 --> 1030.96]  Our call to worship this morning is from Psalm 30, verses 4 to 5.
[1031.54 --> 1034.54]  Sing praises to the Lord, O you his saints,
[1034.90 --> 1036.72]  and give thanks to his holy name.
[1037.32 --> 1039.16]  For his anger is but for a moment,
[1039.56 --> 1041.34]  and his favor is for a lifetime.
[1042.18 --> 1043.64]  Weeping may tarry for the night,
[1043.82 --> 1045.62]  but the joy comes with the morning.
[1045.62 --> 1045.74]  Amen.
[1045.74 --> 1045.78]  Amen.
[1045.78 --> 1045.82]  Amen.
[1045.82 --> 1045.86]  Amen.
[1045.86 --> 1045.90]  Amen.
[1045.90 --> 1045.94]  Amen.
[1045.94 --> 1045.98]  Amen.
[1045.98 --> 1046.02]  Amen.
[1049.58 --> 1075.98]  Amen.
[1075.98 --> 1077.98]  Amen.
[1077.98 --> 1092.04]  Amen.
[1092.08 --> 1092.70]  Amen.
[1092.70 --> 1105.56]  Amen.
[1105.56 --> 1106.04]  Amen.
[1106.04 --> 1108.64]  We'll be soon
[1108.64 --> 1116.78]  Of the bride waiting for the groom
[1116.78 --> 1122.30]  We'll be a church ready for every heart
[1122.30 --> 1125.42]  Longing for our King
[1125.42 --> 1130.46]  We'll sing even so come
[1130.46 --> 1134.54]  Lord Jesus come
[1134.54 --> 1139.14]  Give us so come
[1139.14 --> 1143.30]  Lord Jesus come
[1143.30 --> 1148.36]  There will be justice
[1148.36 --> 1150.32]  All will be new
[1150.32 --> 1152.66]  Your name forever
[1152.66 --> 1154.88]  Faithful and true
[1154.88 --> 1161.08]  Jesus is coming soon
[1161.08 --> 1169.76]  Like a bride waiting for the groom
[1169.76 --> 1174.90]  We'll be a church ready for every heart
[1174.90 --> 1178.90]  Longing for our King
[1178.90 --> 1183.50]  We'll sing even so come
[1183.50 --> 1187.66]  Lord Jesus come
[1187.66 --> 1192.50]  Even so come
[1192.50 --> 1196.62]  Lord Jesus come
[1196.62 --> 1202.16]  So we wait
[1202.16 --> 1206.38]  We wait for you
[1206.38 --> 1211.48]  God we wait
[1211.48 --> 1215.22]  You're coming soon
[1215.22 --> 1219.82]  So we wait
[1219.82 --> 1220.90]  We wait
[1220.90 --> 1223.22]  We wait
[1223.22 --> 1225.60]  For you
[1225.60 --> 1230.30]  God we wait
[1230.30 --> 1235.04]  You're coming soon
[1235.04 --> 1243.72]  Like a bride waiting for her groom
[1243.72 --> 1247.98]  We'll be a church ready for you
[1247.98 --> 1253.16]  Every heart longing for our King
[1253.16 --> 1255.80]  We'll sing
[1255.80 --> 1262.48]  Like a bride waiting for her groom
[1262.48 --> 1266.56]  We'll be a church ready for you
[1266.56 --> 1271.40]  Every heart longing for our King
[1271.40 --> 1274.40]  We sing
[1274.40 --> 1277.00]  Even so come
[1277.00 --> 1277.50]  Even so come
[1277.50 --> 1282.00]  Lord Jesus come
[1282.00 --> 1286.94]  Even so come
[1286.94 --> 1291.72]  Lord Jesus come
[1291.72 --> 1301.20]  Please join me in our prayer of confession and assurance
[1301.20 --> 1307.72]  Dear God
[1307.72 --> 1313.28]  We speak of these ways in which we are preparing ourselves for you
[1313.28 --> 1314.92]  Jesus coming again
[1314.92 --> 1317.46]  And yet we fall short in every way
[1317.46 --> 1320.60]  We resolve to read our Bibles more often
[1320.60 --> 1322.82]  And yet so often we fail to open them
[1322.82 --> 1323.76]  Except for Sundays
[1323.76 --> 1326.02]  We put down our sin
[1326.02 --> 1327.68]  Only to pick it back up again
[1327.68 --> 1329.90]  We try to be patient
[1329.90 --> 1330.46]  Kind
[1330.46 --> 1331.74]  And share Christian love
[1331.74 --> 1332.76]  Only to turn around
[1332.76 --> 1334.24]  And allow anger and judgment
[1334.24 --> 1335.36]  To be our companions
[1335.36 --> 1338.14]  But you are coming
[1338.14 --> 1338.72]  Jesus
[1338.72 --> 1340.24]  That is our hope
[1340.24 --> 1341.60]  That is our future
[1341.60 --> 1343.74]  Lesser lights and comforts
[1343.74 --> 1344.96]  Grasp for our attention
[1344.96 --> 1346.60]  As the happenings of our world
[1346.60 --> 1348.34]  Flutter reality with panic
[1348.34 --> 1349.98]  Or contrast with
[1349.98 --> 1352.46]  Feeding provisions of peace and prosperity
[1352.46 --> 1355.50]  But through the trials
[1355.50 --> 1356.28]  Joys
[1356.28 --> 1356.78]  Waiting
[1356.78 --> 1357.64]  Struggles
[1357.64 --> 1358.34]  Failures
[1358.34 --> 1359.00]  Pain
[1359.00 --> 1361.62]  It is our faith and hope in you
[1361.62 --> 1362.78]  That carries us
[1362.78 --> 1364.20]  And gives us life
[1364.20 --> 1366.36]  Help us
[1366.36 --> 1366.92]  Oh Lord
[1366.92 --> 1368.30]  To be drawn to you
[1368.30 --> 1369.62]  In awe and humility
[1369.62 --> 1370.64]  Of your grace
[1370.64 --> 1372.70]  That when we do fall short
[1372.70 --> 1373.40]  Every day
[1373.40 --> 1375.58]  We can rejoice in the knowledge
[1375.58 --> 1377.00]  That your sacrifice
[1377.00 --> 1377.98]  Your love
[1377.98 --> 1379.96]  Has paid all past
[1379.96 --> 1381.88]  Current and future debts
[1381.88 --> 1383.72]  We have been
[1383.72 --> 1385.32]  And are being made new
[1385.32 --> 1385.78]  In you
[1385.78 --> 1386.30]  Jesus
[1386.30 --> 1388.22]  In your name we pray
[1388.22 --> 1388.98]  Amen

[1417.62 --> 1417.88]  Amen
[1417.88 --> 1418.82]  Amen
[1418.82 --> 1430.22]  Still, my soul be still
[1430.22 --> 1433.84]  And do not fear
[1433.84 --> 1438.34]  The winds of change may rage tomorrow
[1438.34 --> 1444.58]  Your heart is at your side
[1444.58 --> 1447.80]  No longer dread
[1447.80 --> 1452.62]  The fires of unexpected sorrow
[1452.62 --> 1458.62]  Lord, you are my God
[1458.62 --> 1461.60]  And I will trust in you
[1461.60 --> 1465.78]  And not be shaken
[1465.78 --> 1472.78]  Lord, a peace renewed
[1472.78 --> 1477.46]  The steadfast spirit within me
[1477.46 --> 1482.28]  To act in you alone
[1482.28 --> 1501.10]  Still, my soul be still
[1501.10 --> 1505.92]  Do not be moved
[1505.92 --> 1509.92]  By lesser lights and fleeting shadows
[1509.92 --> 1516.16]  Hold on to his ways
[1516.16 --> 1518.92]  With shield of faith
[1518.92 --> 1523.74]  Against temptation's flaming arrow
[1523.74 --> 1528.56]  Lord, you are my God
[1528.56 --> 1532.56]  And I will trust in you
[1532.56 --> 1535.56]  And not be shaken
[1535.56 --> 1542.56]  Lord, a peace renewed
[1542.56 --> 1544.38]  Peace, renew
[1544.38 --> 1547.38]  The steadfast spirit
[1547.38 --> 1549.38]  And will be
[1549.38 --> 1551.38]  To rest
[1551.38 --> 1554.38]  In you alone
[1554.38 --> 1559.20]  Still, my soul be still
[1559.20 --> 1573.20]  Still, my soul be still
[1573.20 --> 1577.20]  Do not forsake
[1577.20 --> 1579.02]  The truth you learned
[1579.02 --> 1579.68]  The truth you learned
[1579.68 --> 1582.02]  In the beginning
[1582.02 --> 1584.02]  Wait
[1584.02 --> 1588.84]  Upon the Lord
[1588.84 --> 1590.84]  And hope will rise
[1590.84 --> 1591.66]  The stars
[1591.66 --> 1593.66]  As stars appear
[1593.66 --> 1594.66]  When days
[1594.66 --> 1595.66]  As stars appear
[1595.66 --> 1596.66]  When days
[1596.66 --> 1597.66]  In me
[1597.66 --> 1602.48]  Lord, you are my God
[1602.48 --> 1604.48]  And I will trust in you
[1604.48 --> 1609.48]  And not be shaken
[1609.48 --> 1615.48]  Lord, a peace renewed
[1615.48 --> 1617.30]  You are my God
[1617.30 --> 1617.48]  And not be shaken
[1617.48 --> 1618.30]  You are my God
[1618.30 --> 1619.30]  And not be shaken
[1619.30 --> 1620.30]  Lord, a peace renewed
[1620.30 --> 1621.30]  And not be shaken
[1621.30 --> 1622.30]  Lord, a peace renewed
[1622.30 --> 1624.12]  You are my God
[1624.12 --> 1625.12]  And not be shaken
[1625.12 --> 1626.12]  You are my God
[1626.12 --> 1628.12]  You are my God
[1628.12 --> 1629.12]  You are my God
[1629.12 --> 1633.12]  You are my God
[1633.12 --> 1637.12]  You are my God
[1637.12 --> 1638.38]  You may be seated
[1638.38 --> 1646.22]  Well, good morning, everyone.
[1646.44 --> 1647.88]  We're back here again this morning
[1647.88 --> 1649.26]  for some Kids Corner time
[1649.26 --> 1651.64]  and it's a pleasure to be here again
[1651.64 --> 1652.46]  Once a month
[1652.46 --> 1653.54]  I look forward to this time
[1653.54 --> 1654.80]  with the kids
[1654.80 --> 1656.64]  whether I can see you or not
[1656.64 --> 1657.82]  but today it's a special day
[1657.82 --> 1658.94]  because we've got a bunch of kids
[1658.94 --> 1660.12]  in the sanctuary here today
[1660.12 --> 1662.06]  so it's been great to see them
[1662.06 --> 1663.64]  and see the smiley face
[1663.64 --> 1665.02]  and see how much kids have grown
[1665.02 --> 1666.14]  so that's kind of exciting.
[1667.06 --> 1668.52]  This morning, first thing
[1668.52 --> 1669.38]  what maybe we'll do
[1669.38 --> 1670.98]  is we've got Emma Smith
[1670.98 --> 1673.78]  doing the memory work for us
[1673.78 --> 1675.16]  so we will start with that
[1675.16 --> 1675.96]  and then I'll introduce
[1675.96 --> 1677.42]  the next part of the
[1677.42 --> 1679.34]  children's worship time here
[1679.34 --> 1679.90]  after that.
[1681.64 --> 1686.70]  For I am the Lord your God
[1686.70 --> 1692.72]  who takes hold of your right hand
[1692.72 --> 1695.16]  and says to you
[1695.16 --> 1697.62]  do not fear
[1697.62 --> 1701.18]  I will help you
[1701.18 --> 1704.54]  Isaiah 41 verse 13
[1704.54 --> 1710.50]  Alright, thanks Emma
[1710.50 --> 1711.12]  that's awesome
[1711.12 --> 1711.88]  that's pretty precious
[1711.88 --> 1712.52]  to see that
[1712.52 --> 1713.12]  so that's great
[1713.12 --> 1713.80]  so this morning
[1713.80 --> 1716.42]  I've got some guests
[1716.42 --> 1717.86]  I've got another video
[1717.86 --> 1718.74]  with some guests on there
[1718.74 --> 1719.36]  I'm going to let them
[1719.36 --> 1720.68]  introduce themselves to you
[1720.68 --> 1722.76]  the story this morning
[1722.76 --> 1724.18]  is about a story in the Bible
[1724.18 --> 1725.78]  where Peter
[1725.78 --> 1726.64]  the Apostle Peter
[1726.64 --> 1728.28]  is doing a lot of preaching
[1728.28 --> 1729.32]  and teaching
[1729.32 --> 1730.52]  through after
[1730.52 --> 1734.30]  as part of the Apostles
[1734.30 --> 1735.96]  and going around Jerusalem
[1735.96 --> 1736.50]  and stuff
[1736.50 --> 1738.34]  and preaching the Gospel
[1738.34 --> 1739.30]  and here in this story
[1739.30 --> 1740.74]  it's about Tabith
[1740.74 --> 1742.06]  who is also named Dorcas
[1742.06 --> 1744.22]  so it's a story
[1744.22 --> 1745.34]  that you don't hear too often
[1745.34 --> 1746.68]  but it's one that we're
[1746.68 --> 1747.94]  sharing with you this morning
[1747.94 --> 1749.88]  so here it is
[1749.88 --> 1751.54]  Alright everybody

[1883.04 --> 1883.94]  see if I can do it
[1883.94 --> 1884.38]  alright
[1884.38 --> 1885.46]  here we go
[1885.46 --> 1892.64]  okay

[1894.78 --> 1896.06]  behind the back twice
[1896.06 --> 1896.70]  and then
[1896.70 --> 1897.74]  put it in the hoop
[1897.74 --> 1899.96]  through the legs
[1899.96 --> 1900.70]  behind the back
[1900.70 --> 1901.20]  through the hoop
[1901.20 --> 1901.70]  here we go
[1901.70 --> 1902.58]  through the legs
[1902.58 --> 1904.58]  behind the back
[1904.58 --> 1905.22]  how about this

[1906.94 --> 1908.12]  you have to shoot
[1908.12 --> 1909.68]  did I do it right?
[1909.70 --> 1911.44]  shoot
[1911.44 --> 1913.62]  alright Ryan
[1913.62 --> 1913.98]  Wesley
[1913.98 --> 1914.58]  you guys are going
[1914.58 --> 1915.04]  to help me
[1915.04 --> 1915.82]  tell the story
[1915.82 --> 1916.48]  tell the kids
[1916.48 --> 1917.02]  and all the people
[1917.02 --> 1918.70]  watching on TV
[1918.70 --> 1919.42]  at home
[1919.42 --> 1920.86]  for the church service
[1920.86 --> 1922.40]  have you guys
[1922.40 --> 1923.82]  heard this story before?
[1924.34 --> 1924.58]  yeah
[1924.58 --> 1925.74]  you've heard it before?
[1926.30 --> 1928.80]  I remember it
[1928.80 --> 1930.12]  but I couldn't
[1930.12 --> 1931.00]  remember it too well
[1931.00 --> 1931.90]  so this is kind of
[1931.90 --> 1932.40]  a good story
[1932.40 --> 1933.50]  to go over again
[1933.50 --> 1935.10]  who are the characters
[1935.10 --> 1935.78]  in the story?
[1936.50 --> 1936.98]  Peter
[1936.98 --> 1938.14]  the widow
[1938.14 --> 1939.86]  and
[1939.86 --> 1941.20]  Tabitha
[1941.20 --> 1941.86]  Tabitha
[1941.86 --> 1942.42]  what was her
[1942.42 --> 1943.24]  she had another name
[1943.24 --> 1944.08]  what was her other name?
[1944.26 --> 1944.64]  Dorcas
[1944.64 --> 1945.20]  Dorcas
[1945.20 --> 1947.28]  and what was she?
[1947.76 --> 1948.62]  what was her job?
[1949.08 --> 1950.40]  she helped the poor
[1950.40 --> 1950.80]  yeah
[1950.80 --> 1951.76]  she was a disciple
[1951.76 --> 1952.56]  yeah
[1952.56 --> 1952.84]  okay
[1952.84 --> 1956.30]  so she helped the poor
[1956.30 --> 1957.90]  and she did some good things
[1957.90 --> 1958.94]  she was always helping people
[1958.94 --> 1959.26]  I think
[1959.26 --> 1959.50]  right?
[1959.64 --> 1959.86]  yeah
[1959.86 --> 1962.78]  what happened to Tabitha
[1962.78 --> 1963.40]  in the story?
[1963.86 --> 1965.46]  she got sick and died
[1965.46 --> 1966.28]  and then
[1966.28 --> 1966.30]  and then
[1966.30 --> 1967.56]  and then
[1967.56 --> 1969.36]  the widows
[1969.36 --> 1970.04]  called her
[1970.04 --> 1970.58]  and then
[1970.58 --> 1971.70]  he came
[1971.70 --> 1972.92]  he prayed
[1972.92 --> 1973.90]  and then
[1973.90 --> 1976.02]  he said
[1976.02 --> 1976.68]  Tabitha
[1976.68 --> 1977.42]  wake up
[1977.42 --> 1978.52]  and then Tabitha
[1978.52 --> 1979.60]  opened her eyes
[1979.60 --> 1980.20]  okay
[1980.20 --> 1981.40]  so
[1981.40 --> 1982.88]  Wesley's really getting ahead
[1982.88 --> 1983.74]  on me on the story
[1983.74 --> 1984.48]  but that's awesome
[1984.48 --> 1985.46]  Wesley knows the story
[1985.46 --> 1985.98]  really good
[1985.98 --> 1986.26]  so
[1986.26 --> 1987.88]  Tabitha got sick
[1987.88 --> 1988.58]  and she died
[1988.58 --> 1989.44]  and then what did they do
[1989.44 --> 1990.08]  with their body?
[1990.38 --> 1992.20]  they put it in an upstairs room
[1992.20 --> 1993.08]  and after they
[1993.08 --> 1993.72]  cleaned it
[1993.72 --> 1994.44]  and they prepared it
[1994.44 --> 1995.70]  and they put it in an upstairs room
[1995.70 --> 1997.28]  so
[1997.28 --> 1999.04]  there's a guy in the Bible
[1999.04 --> 1999.56]  named Peter
[1999.56 --> 2000.72]  they talk about him a lot
[2000.72 --> 2002.30]  and he was in a town nearby
[2002.30 --> 2003.12]  called Lydda
[2003.12 --> 2004.26]  which was near the town
[2004.26 --> 2004.70]  they were in
[2004.70 --> 2005.40]  called Joppa
[2005.40 --> 2006.72]  and how does Peter
[2006.72 --> 2008.04]  become part of this story?
[2008.14 --> 2009.20]  what does he do in this story?
[2009.54 --> 2010.82]  he comes from
[2010.82 --> 2012.56]  because the widows
[2012.56 --> 2013.28]  call him
[2013.28 --> 2014.74]  and
[2014.74 --> 2016.78]  and
[2016.78 --> 2017.64]  he
[2017.64 --> 2019.30]  he
[2019.30 --> 2020.40]  prays
[2020.40 --> 2021.10]  and then
[2021.10 --> 2023.92]  he says
[2023.92 --> 2024.42]  Tabitha
[2024.42 --> 2025.18]  get up
[2025.18 --> 2026.12]  and then
[2026.12 --> 2026.80]  Tabitha
[2026.80 --> 2028.58]  looks at him
[2028.58 --> 2029.66]  and
[2029.66 --> 2030.78]  he gets up
[2030.78 --> 2031.40]  right
[2031.40 --> 2032.86]  so when Peter
[2032.86 --> 2033.90]  came to the house
[2033.90 --> 2035.78]  when he first got to the house
[2035.78 --> 2037.14]  what was happening in the house?
[2037.26 --> 2038.40]  there was all kinds of commotion
[2038.40 --> 2038.90]  happening there
[2038.90 --> 2039.84]  what was happening there
[2039.84 --> 2040.38]  in the house?
[2040.90 --> 2042.04]  the widows were crying
[2042.04 --> 2042.70]  so all the
[2042.70 --> 2044.28]  all the widows from the town
[2044.28 --> 2044.84]  were crying
[2044.84 --> 2045.80]  and they were showing him
[2045.80 --> 2046.96]  showing Peter something
[2046.96 --> 2048.58]  what did they have
[2048.58 --> 2049.40]  that they wanted to show
[2049.40 --> 2050.12]  show him?
[2050.58 --> 2050.76]  oh
[2050.76 --> 2051.90]  the clothes that
[2051.90 --> 2053.04]  Tabitha made
[2053.04 --> 2054.30]  yeah Tabitha made a whole
[2054.30 --> 2055.00]  she wants to have been
[2055.00 --> 2055.96]  somebody who made clothes
[2055.96 --> 2056.86]  and they were really proud
[2056.86 --> 2057.46]  of the clothes
[2057.46 --> 2058.12]  that she made
[2058.12 --> 2058.38]  so
[2058.38 --> 2058.98]  she
[2058.98 --> 2060.22]  these widows
[2060.22 --> 2061.50]  were pretty excited
[2061.50 --> 2061.80]  about it
[2061.80 --> 2062.46]  and they wanted to show
[2062.46 --> 2063.32]  Peter how much of a
[2063.32 --> 2064.44]  great person she was
[2064.44 --> 2065.30]  at that point
[2065.30 --> 2066.04]  so Peter
[2066.04 --> 2067.90]  all these women
[2067.90 --> 2068.36]  are crying
[2068.36 --> 2068.74]  and then
[2068.74 --> 2069.66]  Peter
[2069.66 --> 2070.36]  does what?
[2070.42 --> 2070.88]  what does he tell
[2070.88 --> 2071.26]  all the women
[2071.26 --> 2071.62]  to do?
[2072.36 --> 2072.84]  um
[2072.84 --> 2074.76]  what are they
[2074.76 --> 2075.38]  supposed to do?
[2076.06 --> 2076.46]  wait
[2076.46 --> 2077.06]  no
[2077.06 --> 2077.88]  he asked them
[2077.88 --> 2078.28]  to leave
[2078.28 --> 2078.88]  because he's
[2078.88 --> 2079.44]  going to do what?
[2079.50 --> 2080.40]  what does he do next?
[2080.74 --> 2081.10]  pray
[2081.10 --> 2082.68]  he prays
[2082.68 --> 2084.54]  beside Tabitha
[2084.54 --> 2085.68]  and he says to her
[2085.68 --> 2086.98]  Tabitha get up
[2086.98 --> 2088.00]  Tabitha get up
[2088.00 --> 2088.88]  so he
[2088.88 --> 2090.24]  Peter grabs her hand
[2090.24 --> 2091.50]  and gets her to stand up
[2091.50 --> 2092.30]  and takes her out
[2092.30 --> 2092.60]  of the room
[2092.60 --> 2093.74]  and what was the reaction
[2093.74 --> 2094.86]  of all the people
[2094.86 --> 2095.70]  when they saw
[2095.70 --> 2097.18]  Tabitha come out
[2097.18 --> 2097.58]  of the room
[2097.58 --> 2098.66]  um
[2098.66 --> 2099.82]  they were happy
[2099.82 --> 2101.46]  and what did the people do?
[2101.62 --> 2103.14]  this was an amazing miracle
[2103.14 --> 2103.92]  I don't think people
[2103.92 --> 2104.90]  have ever seen somebody
[2104.90 --> 2106.02]  be raised from the dead
[2106.02 --> 2106.04]  um
[2106.04 --> 2107.44]  they started to believe in God
[2107.44 --> 2108.26]  so they thought
[2108.26 --> 2109.10]  this is pretty cool
[2109.10 --> 2109.74]  this God
[2109.74 --> 2110.60]  is quite something
[2110.60 --> 2111.46]  so maybe we should
[2111.46 --> 2112.34]  follow him too
[2112.34 --> 2114.44]  so the story
[2114.44 --> 2115.52]  has a couple ideas
[2115.52 --> 2116.08]  uh
[2116.08 --> 2117.04]  that are important
[2117.04 --> 2117.56]  what do you think
[2117.56 --> 2118.10]  one of the
[2118.10 --> 2119.18]  what is one of the
[2119.18 --> 2120.38]  one ideas that's really
[2120.38 --> 2121.20]  important in this story
[2121.20 --> 2122.40]  what makes it kind of special?
[2122.74 --> 2123.80]  to help other people
[2123.80 --> 2125.34]  to help other people
[2125.34 --> 2126.14]  and that
[2126.14 --> 2127.42]  Peter does something
[2127.42 --> 2127.86]  amazing
[2127.86 --> 2128.54]  which is
[2128.54 --> 2130.50]  what does Peter do?
[2131.02 --> 2132.06]  make her alive
[2132.06 --> 2132.86]  makes her alive
[2132.86 --> 2133.58]  and makes people
[2133.58 --> 2134.20]  want to believe
[2134.20 --> 2135.12]  and follow Jesus
[2135.12 --> 2136.94]  and the second thing
[2136.94 --> 2137.42]  that's cool
[2137.42 --> 2137.96]  in this story
[2137.96 --> 2138.32]  is that
[2138.32 --> 2139.20]  remember Peter
[2139.20 --> 2140.04]  was in Joppa
[2140.04 --> 2140.76]  and then he went
[2140.76 --> 2141.26]  to Lydda
[2141.26 --> 2141.98]  or he was in Lydda
[2141.98 --> 2142.84]  and went to Joppa
[2142.84 --> 2143.56]  that's how
[2143.56 --> 2145.00]  that's how
[2145.00 --> 2145.88]  back in those days
[2145.88 --> 2146.68]  that's how the
[2146.68 --> 2148.26]  good news of Jesus
[2148.26 --> 2148.82]  was spread
[2148.82 --> 2149.36]  they didn't have
[2149.36 --> 2149.76]  do you think
[2149.76 --> 2150.38]  they had computers
[2150.38 --> 2150.96]  back then?
[2151.22 --> 2151.62]  no
[2151.62 --> 2152.54]  did they have TVs?
[2152.82 --> 2153.06]  no
[2153.06 --> 2154.54]  so the only way
[2154.54 --> 2155.32]  they never had electricity
[2155.32 --> 2156.00]  they didn't even
[2156.00 --> 2156.60]  have electricity
[2156.60 --> 2157.58]  so the only way
[2157.58 --> 2158.68]  information could get
[2158.68 --> 2159.78]  transferred around
[2159.78 --> 2160.70]  from city to city
[2160.70 --> 2161.28]  is if somebody
[2161.28 --> 2162.02]  walked around
[2162.02 --> 2162.68]  and shared
[2162.68 --> 2163.92]  the news
[2163.92 --> 2164.60]  so that's how
[2164.60 --> 2167.12]  they would write stuff
[2167.12 --> 2167.72]  and they could send
[2167.72 --> 2168.40]  letters and stuff
[2168.40 --> 2168.94]  that's the way
[2168.94 --> 2169.50]  things were done
[2169.50 --> 2170.02]  back then
[2170.02 --> 2171.16]  so that's how
[2171.16 --> 2172.22]  the good news
[2172.22 --> 2173.08]  of Jesus Christ
[2173.08 --> 2173.94]  was passed around
[2173.94 --> 2174.80]  from town to town
[2174.80 --> 2175.46]  so that's kind of
[2175.46 --> 2177.54]  another fun thing
[2177.54 --> 2178.08]  that happened
[2178.08 --> 2178.76]  in this story
[2178.76 --> 2179.56]  so thanks for
[2179.56 --> 2179.98]  helping me out
[2179.98 --> 2180.44]  with this story
[2180.44 --> 2181.88]  that's it for today
[2181.88 --> 2182.76]  do you guys
[2182.76 --> 2183.04]  want to do
[2183.04 --> 2183.64]  another challenge
[2183.64 --> 2184.34]  on the trampoline?
[2184.74 --> 2185.02]  yeah
[2185.02 --> 2185.60]  okay
[2185.60 --> 2186.30]  let's do that
[2186.30 --> 2187.84]  show me some

[2194.24 --> 2196.38]  I've done it before
[2196.38 --> 2197.06]  alright I'm going to
[2197.06 --> 2197.56]  try one of those
[2197.56 --> 2198.22]  get out of my way
[2198.22 --> 2199.30]  this could get ugly

[2961.88 --> 2966.98]  for I am the Lord your God your God who takes hold of your
[2966.98 --> 2973.52]  right hand and says to you do not fear I will help you we ask
[2973.52 --> 2976.48]  for a blessing over the message we will hear from Kevin from the
[2976.48 --> 2981.12]  words of James 5 let our hearts and minds be willing to accept
[2981.12 --> 2986.86]  these words we thank you for the opportunity to cast lots for new
[2986.86 --> 2991.36]  elders and deacons today we thank you for the work of your spirit in
[2991.36 --> 2995.76]  the hearts of so many who wish to serve be with those that are

[2998.94 --> 3004.24]  here also be with those that are not chosen this year let them
[3004.24 --> 3009.62]  continue to have the desire to serve your church in the future we ask for a
[3009.62 --> 3016.62]  blessing over the casting of lots Lord we offer a prayer of thanks for all
[3016.62 --> 3021.26]  those whose terms are coming to an end we thank you for the abilities you gave
[3021.26 --> 3026.24]  them to serve your church here and Emmanuel give each one a time of
[3026.24 --> 3032.98]  refreshment and rest Lord we pray all these things through you through the death
[3032.98 --> 3040.38]  resurrection and ascension of your son in his name we pray amen
[3062.98 --> 3068.98]  the apostles had to choose a new leader from among them they cast lots and
[3068.98 --> 3074.12]  Matthias was chosen relying on the providence of God we will now select new
[3074.12 --> 3081.46]  office bearers for Langley Emmanuel by the same process as Proverbs 16 says the lot is
[3081.46 --> 3087.98]  cast into the lap but it's very every decision is from the Lord
[3087.98 --> 3092.98]  first we would like to give thanks to God for all the many people who agree to
[3092.98 --> 3096.98]  let their name stand and in the nomination of the church look for the call of God to
[3096.98 --> 3102.56]  serve so whether your name comes up today or not we are grateful for your
[3102.56 --> 3108.98]  willingness to serve and we trust that God will provide another opportunity for you to do so
[3108.98 --> 3116.98]  why don't we first pray for this process father God thank you for Emmanuel thank you for this this
[3116.98 --> 3124.98]  great faithful group of believers that gather here and thank you for all the people who have let their
[3124.98 --> 3133.98]  names stand for office this coming year that is such a grateful and faithful sign of your presence here
[3133.98 --> 3154.98]  amongst us and so Lord now we pray for the process of drawing lots we pray that the men and women that you have in mind will be chosen and we also pray for those who are not chosen that they too might see that you calling them to do other things so we thank you for your presence here and we invite you in here as we draw the lots

[3276.98 --> 3283.98]  what a Sunday we are having today
[3283.98 --> 3298.98]  to see people here in church so good that we can be joined at home hopefully you have tuned in and you're not still in your beds waiting for 15 minutes but this will come as a shock to you in a few moments if you haven't joined us yet which I don't even know why I'm talking to you but this will come as a shock to you in a few moments if you haven't joined us with our children I'm not sure that we could be joined at home hopefully
[3298.98 --> 3301.80]  and you're not still in your beds waiting for 15 minutes,
[3302.00 --> 3304.30]  but this will come as a shock to you in a few moments
[3304.30 --> 3305.46]  if you haven't joined us yet,
[3305.54 --> 3307.74]  which I don't even know why I'm talking to you then at this moment.
[3308.66 --> 3311.04]  We have people here today.
[3311.20 --> 3311.72]  That's great.
[3311.88 --> 3314.78]  We have a couple services happening today as well,
[3314.86 --> 3315.48]  which is awesome.
[3315.88 --> 3317.78]  We just drew some new office bearers.
[3317.90 --> 3319.32]  Clem has become a member.
[3319.96 --> 3321.94]  Matt and Nicole are engaged.
[3322.26 --> 3325.08]  We're celebrating communion as a community today
[3325.08 --> 3326.02]  in just a little bit.
[3326.82 --> 3327.40]  What a morning.
[3327.40 --> 3330.32]  And now you're stuck with me for 20 minutes.
[3331.24 --> 3333.86]  Hopefully you've all seen the video before the service
[3333.86 --> 3335.32]  that Pastor Chris made this week,
[3335.40 --> 3336.72]  the one with the little blue birdie.
[3337.20 --> 3340.36]  Changes just sort of keep driving forward, don't they?
[3340.92 --> 3342.24]  Speaking of birdies and driving,
[3342.62 --> 3343.38]  great segue, Kevin,
[3343.66 --> 3348.42]  I went golfing with Pastor Chris and Aaron Elkema a week or two ago.
[3349.24 --> 3350.46]  It was a good round of golf.
[3350.80 --> 3351.56]  It was a good round of golf.
[3351.56 --> 3352.76]  I destroyed them both.
[3353.34 --> 3354.48]  Just wrecked them.
[3354.54 --> 3355.24]  It wasn't even close.
[3355.24 --> 3358.04]  I can't remember by how many strokes I beat them by
[3358.04 --> 3360.28]  because Pastor Chris wouldn't let me keep the scorecard
[3360.28 --> 3361.80]  and frame it and put it up in his office.
[3362.08 --> 3364.00]  So my memory will just have to do, I guess.
[3364.50 --> 3366.18]  But there was a moment in that game
[3366.18 --> 3369.68]  where Aaron's ball ended up in like a little gully
[3369.68 --> 3370.94]  that was lined with rocks.
[3371.26 --> 3372.62]  And he went to hit the ball out
[3372.62 --> 3374.34]  and he hit a lip of the crater
[3374.34 --> 3376.04]  and the ball went behind him.
[3376.08 --> 3377.70]  I actually caught the whole thing on video
[3377.70 --> 3379.18]  and I made a gif about it,
[3379.28 --> 3380.82]  which I think we're going to watch right now.
[3380.82 --> 3383.46]  Oh, poor Aaron.
[3383.54 --> 3383.96]  Look at him.
[3385.72 --> 3388.20]  There's a moment actually just after it hits the rock.
[3388.28 --> 3389.42]  If you see, he kind of shudders.
[3389.54 --> 3390.92]  He fears for his life for a moment.
[3393.26 --> 3397.18]  Now, what followed that was some grumbling
[3397.18 --> 3399.80]  and I'm pretty sure the golf club ended up
[3399.80 --> 3401.84]  a few meters away from him as well.
[3401.84 --> 3405.82]  But in fairness to Aaron, and I should say this,
[3405.88 --> 3407.94]  he gave me full permission to talk about this today
[3407.94 --> 3408.90]  and even show that.
[3410.22 --> 3412.00]  And secondly, while there's video evidence
[3412.00 --> 3414.02]  of that moment in Aaron's life,
[3414.12 --> 3415.36]  of him having a poor go there,
[3415.64 --> 3417.94]  he was not the only one having a rough time
[3417.94 --> 3419.72]  or taking some rough hacks that day.
[3420.22 --> 3420.90]  Right, Pastor Chris?
[3422.48 --> 3426.24]  See, golf has a way of making
[3426.24 --> 3428.92]  even the most level-headed of us
[3428.92 --> 3430.70]  lose our patience,
[3430.70 --> 3433.00]  lose our minds.
[3433.86 --> 3434.60]  And so today,
[3434.86 --> 3437.34]  we are going to be looking at this text in James.
[3437.46 --> 3438.46]  It's the penultimate,
[3438.68 --> 3439.62]  that's the word of the day,
[3439.74 --> 3441.80]  penultimate text in our sermon series,
[3442.32 --> 3443.78]  doers or hearers and doers.
[3443.86 --> 3445.56]  And we're going to see this passage
[3445.56 --> 3448.28]  is all about patience and perseverance.
[3448.58 --> 3449.36]  So listen up, Aaron.
[3450.32 --> 3452.38]  Whether you're here with us in person today,
[3452.48 --> 3453.86]  and it's so great to have people here,
[3453.90 --> 3455.44]  or you are at home watching,
[3455.80 --> 3457.66]  I invite you now, please open up your Bibles,
[3457.66 --> 3460.30]  turn with us to James chapter 5.
[3460.30 --> 3463.48]  We're going to be reading verses 7 to 12 together.
[3463.62 --> 3464.54]  So if you're at home,
[3464.66 --> 3465.34]  snuggle in,
[3465.78 --> 3467.22]  exercise your patience.
[3467.38 --> 3468.04]  If you're here,
[3468.18 --> 3469.02]  follow along
[3469.02 --> 3471.04]  and read with me James 5,
[3471.40 --> 3473.02]  verses 7 to 12,
[3473.08 --> 3473.82]  where it says this,
[3473.82 --> 3487.20]  Brothers and sisters,
[3487.20 --> 3501.30]  Brothers and sisters,
[3501.30 --> 3503.90]  as an example of patience in the face of suffering,
[3504.28 --> 3507.70]  take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
[3507.70 --> 3508.66]  As you know,
[3508.72 --> 3511.50]  we count as blessed those who have persevered.
[3512.02 --> 3513.74]  You have heard Job's perseverance
[3513.74 --> 3516.48]  and have seen what the Lord finally brought about.
[3517.14 --> 3520.40]  The Lord is full of compassion and mercy.
[3521.88 --> 3522.84]  Above all,
[3522.94 --> 3523.96]  my brothers and sisters,
[3524.08 --> 3524.76]  do not swear,
[3524.88 --> 3527.24]  not by heaven or by earth or by anything else.
[3527.48 --> 3530.12]  All you need to say is a simple yes or no.
[3530.68 --> 3531.02]  Otherwise,
[3531.22 --> 3532.22]  you will be condemned.
[3533.08 --> 3534.62]  The word of the Lord.
[3534.62 --> 3534.94]  Now,
[3537.02 --> 3539.08]  a little reminder of where we're coming from
[3539.08 --> 3540.14]  in this text today.
[3540.24 --> 3540.80]  Two weeks ago,
[3540.92 --> 3542.32]  Pastor Chris preached
[3542.32 --> 3546.44]  on the first six verses of James 5,
[3546.84 --> 3548.50]  where James condemns
[3548.50 --> 3550.86]  the wealthy non-Christians
[3550.86 --> 3553.58]  who are persecuting the readers of this letter.
[3554.72 --> 3556.24]  James says the pursuit of money
[3556.24 --> 3558.24]  will inevitably lead to their destruction.
[3558.96 --> 3560.08]  Well, today's text,
[3560.52 --> 3561.98]  James is responding to that.
[3561.98 --> 3564.88]  He is once again speaking to the believers
[3564.88 --> 3566.54]  in this church,
[3566.62 --> 3568.90]  the believers who are reading this letter.
[3568.98 --> 3570.60]  We see that right away in verse 7
[3570.60 --> 3574.76]  when James addresses them as brothers and sisters.
[3575.68 --> 3577.94]  James here gives his response to the persecution
[3577.94 --> 3580.40]  his readers may be experiencing
[3580.40 --> 3584.02]  from the wealthy non-Christians in their community.
[3585.42 --> 3587.22]  James tells his readers how to respond
[3587.22 --> 3588.62]  in light of that persecution.
[3588.62 --> 3591.38]  Notice his response.
[3593.22 --> 3595.20]  Be patient then, brothers and sisters,
[3595.36 --> 3597.38]  until the Lord's coming.
[3599.26 --> 3601.90]  James' message to those experiencing injustice
[3601.90 --> 3603.68]  is not one of revolution.
[3604.68 --> 3605.72]  They're not to riot,
[3606.16 --> 3606.86]  to revolt,
[3607.02 --> 3608.26]  they're not to make a scene,
[3608.44 --> 3610.62]  or even call out the injustices
[3610.62 --> 3612.54]  or the persecutions that they may be facing.
[3612.54 --> 3617.06]  Rather, James simply calls them
[3617.06 --> 3618.92]  the patience.
[3620.44 --> 3621.78]  No violence.
[3622.60 --> 3623.92]  No outrage.
[3625.90 --> 3626.58]  Patience.
[3628.68 --> 3629.32]  Patience.
[3629.74 --> 3631.46]  Mature endurance.
[3631.72 --> 3633.30]  Patience is the inner quality
[3633.30 --> 3635.90]  that produces the outer manifestation
[3635.90 --> 3637.60]  of perseverance.
[3638.44 --> 3640.94]  That's what James is calling his readers to.
[3640.94 --> 3644.64]  He wants them to practice patience
[3644.64 --> 3646.46]  and perseverance.
[3648.40 --> 3651.08]  You'll notice James uses two people
[3651.08 --> 3653.44]  as examples of patience and perseverance.
[3653.92 --> 3656.80]  He calls us to be patient like the farmer
[3656.80 --> 3659.48]  and perseverant like the prophet.
[3660.72 --> 3661.78]  If you're taking notes today,
[3661.86 --> 3662.70]  there's your two headings.
[3663.14 --> 3664.32]  Patient like the farmer,
[3664.76 --> 3666.36]  perseverant like the prophet.
[3666.72 --> 3667.60]  We'll start with the farmer.
[3668.28 --> 3669.70]  Farmers need to be patient
[3669.70 --> 3671.88]  with things that are out of their control.
[3672.94 --> 3674.72]  Farmers of the ancient Near East,
[3674.88 --> 3675.60]  and truthfully,
[3675.76 --> 3677.56]  of the current West Coast,
[3678.06 --> 3680.04]  they rely heavily on the rain.
[3680.92 --> 3681.40]  Back then,
[3681.44 --> 3682.56]  they got rain twice a year.
[3682.64 --> 3683.56]  They got it in August,
[3684.20 --> 3685.48]  and they got it in the spring.
[3686.34 --> 3688.78]  A farmer would plant their crop in August,
[3689.26 --> 3689.92]  needing the rain
[3689.92 --> 3691.62]  to sort of help the seeds take root,
[3691.62 --> 3692.82]  and then wait for months,
[3693.86 --> 3696.02]  patiently anticipating the spring rain
[3696.02 --> 3697.60]  to reveal their crop.
[3698.88 --> 3701.12]  Now, while the farmer waits for the spring rain,
[3701.18 --> 3701.48]  of course,
[3701.56 --> 3702.54]  there's work to be done.
[3702.82 --> 3703.76]  They work eagerly.
[3703.92 --> 3704.88]  They work patiently.
[3705.22 --> 3706.22]  They work faithfully,
[3706.36 --> 3707.48]  and they work diligently.
[3708.14 --> 3710.40]  But while they work,
[3711.20 --> 3712.28]  they wait.
[3713.96 --> 3716.18]  They patiently wait
[3716.18 --> 3718.36]  for the rain in the spring
[3718.36 --> 3720.48]  to come and grow their crops.
[3720.48 --> 3723.34]  Now, the readers of this letter
[3723.34 --> 3725.04]  would have taken note of this imagery.
[3725.16 --> 3726.62]  They would have no doubt remembered
[3726.62 --> 3728.26]  the promises of God
[3728.26 --> 3729.88]  found in Deuteronomy 11,
[3730.22 --> 3731.32]  where it says,
[3732.40 --> 3734.32]  If you faithfully obey
[3734.32 --> 3736.40]  the commands I am giving you today,
[3736.74 --> 3738.24]  to love the Lord your God
[3738.24 --> 3739.82]  and to serve him with all your heart
[3739.82 --> 3741.06]  and with all your soul,
[3741.96 --> 3744.26]  then I will send rain on your land
[3744.26 --> 3744.94]  in its season,
[3745.34 --> 3747.98]  both autumn and spring rains,
[3748.12 --> 3750.06]  so that you may gather in your grain,
[3750.06 --> 3751.04]  new wine,
[3751.48 --> 3752.24]  and olive oil.
[3754.10 --> 3756.28]  We are called to that same obedience,
[3756.52 --> 3757.30]  to love the Lord
[3757.30 --> 3759.00]  and to serve him with all our hearts.
[3759.36 --> 3760.64]  James uses the farmer
[3760.64 --> 3762.20]  as an example for us all
[3762.20 --> 3764.38]  to be patient in times
[3764.38 --> 3765.82]  that we cannot control.
[3767.04 --> 3768.60]  The farmer can't control the rain.
[3769.94 --> 3771.92]  We can't control our circumstances
[3771.92 --> 3772.58]  all the time.
[3773.82 --> 3775.34]  But the calling is the same,
[3775.42 --> 3776.92]  to love and serve the Lord
[3776.92 --> 3778.96]  and to do so patiently
[3778.96 --> 3780.92]  in good times
[3780.92 --> 3782.50]  and in rough times,
[3782.58 --> 3784.54]  while persecuted or not,
[3784.86 --> 3786.72]  trusting in the Lord's provision
[3786.72 --> 3788.44]  for all our lives.
[3788.66 --> 3790.24]  His timing is not our timing.
[3791.82 --> 3793.24]  But we are to be patient
[3793.24 --> 3796.16]  in times we cannot control.
[3797.94 --> 3799.30]  So when the world around us
[3799.30 --> 3800.32]  is out of control,
[3801.32 --> 3802.66]  how do we respond?
[3802.66 --> 3805.34]  Do we respond with patience?
[3806.72 --> 3807.18]  This year,
[3807.40 --> 3808.46]  this past year is like
[3808.46 --> 3810.30]  the perfect example of this.
[3811.18 --> 3812.30]  During this pandemic,
[3813.32 --> 3815.54]  when decisions have been made for you,
[3815.68 --> 3817.88]  when restrictions have been put in place
[3817.88 --> 3819.34]  that you had no control over,
[3819.56 --> 3821.94]  when doors of buildings were closed,
[3822.10 --> 3824.20]  when businesses slowed down,
[3824.50 --> 3826.98]  when traveling was banned,
[3827.58 --> 3830.64]  when graduations were canceled,
[3830.64 --> 3836.54]  everything you once had in your hands
[3836.54 --> 3838.24]  started slipping through your fingertips.
[3839.68 --> 3840.96]  How did you respond?
[3842.74 --> 3843.98]  How did you respond
[3843.98 --> 3845.60]  when your life got interrupted?
[3845.94 --> 3847.20]  Were you patient,
[3847.88 --> 3849.02]  knowing that God,
[3849.40 --> 3850.26]  as always,
[3850.60 --> 3851.42]  was in control?
[3853.48 --> 3854.48]  Or did you grumble?
[3854.76 --> 3856.86]  Did you fight for that control back?
[3856.86 --> 3860.34]  It's so good we're all here today,
[3860.42 --> 3861.86]  but the pandemic's not over yet.
[3862.74 --> 3864.18]  Are we being patient
[3864.18 --> 3865.62]  in the midst of it?
[3867.44 --> 3869.02]  James doubles down on his point.
[3869.50 --> 3870.76]  After talking about the farmer
[3870.76 --> 3871.46]  in verse 7
[3871.46 --> 3873.16]  and calling us to be patient
[3873.16 --> 3874.30]  in verse 8,
[3875.22 --> 3876.24]  verse 9 says this,
[3876.50 --> 3878.76]  do not grumble against one another,
[3878.88 --> 3879.70]  brothers and sisters,
[3880.06 --> 3881.16]  or you will be judged.
[3881.16 --> 3884.82]  We're to practice patience
[3884.82 --> 3887.14]  by bearing our afflictions
[3887.14 --> 3889.12]  without grumbling.
[3889.90 --> 3891.20]  When we find ourselves
[3891.20 --> 3892.28]  in difficult situations
[3892.28 --> 3893.40]  where our lives
[3893.40 --> 3894.88]  may be spinning out of control,
[3895.14 --> 3897.02]  it becomes very easy for us
[3897.02 --> 3898.50]  to grumble, doesn't it?
[3899.08 --> 3901.38]  We find like-minded people
[3901.38 --> 3902.58]  and we complain
[3902.58 --> 3903.78]  about what we're going through,
[3904.10 --> 3905.44]  the injustices we feel
[3905.44 --> 3906.72]  that are happening against us,
[3906.78 --> 3908.16]  or we complain about others
[3908.16 --> 3909.84]  who maybe do not share
[3909.84 --> 3910.84]  the same perspectives
[3910.84 --> 3911.74]  that we have.
[3913.62 --> 3914.70]  But James says,
[3914.86 --> 3916.20]  do not grumble
[3916.20 --> 3917.42]  against one another.
[3919.02 --> 3920.40]  Now, this is not code.
[3920.70 --> 3921.82]  This is not even subtle.
[3922.48 --> 3923.72]  This is just to the point.
[3924.10 --> 3925.74]  Do not grumble
[3925.74 --> 3927.04]  against one another.
[3929.12 --> 3929.74]  So again,
[3929.80 --> 3930.88]  using our current context
[3930.88 --> 3931.72]  to highlight this,
[3932.80 --> 3933.40]  do we grumble?
[3933.64 --> 3934.38]  Are we grumbling
[3934.38 --> 3935.58]  against one another?
[3935.80 --> 3936.84]  Are you complaining
[3936.84 --> 3937.56]  to your friends
[3937.56 --> 3938.42]  about the situation
[3938.42 --> 3939.40]  you find yourselves in?
[3939.40 --> 3940.36]  Are we grumbling
[3940.36 --> 3941.84]  about having to wear masks
[3941.84 --> 3943.04]  or about others
[3943.04 --> 3944.24]  who aren't wearing masks?
[3944.44 --> 3945.10]  Are you grumbling
[3945.10 --> 3945.64]  about people
[3945.64 --> 3947.08]  who aren't getting vaccined?
[3947.22 --> 3947.82]  Or are you grumbling
[3947.82 --> 3948.32]  about people
[3948.32 --> 3949.28]  who already have gotten
[3949.28 --> 3950.04]  that vaccine?
[3950.46 --> 3951.56]  Are we grumbling
[3951.56 --> 3952.68]  about people
[3952.68 --> 3953.96]  on one side of the spectrum
[3953.96 --> 3954.88]  when we find ourselves
[3954.88 --> 3955.54]  on the other side
[3955.54 --> 3956.12]  of that spectrum?
[3958.06 --> 3958.80]  There's room
[3958.80 --> 3959.92]  for discussion, sure.
[3960.08 --> 3960.98]  There's lots of room
[3960.98 --> 3961.90]  even for disagreement.
[3963.58 --> 3965.44]  But there's no room
[3965.44 --> 3966.34]  for grumbling.
[3966.34 --> 3968.58]  Do not grumble
[3968.58 --> 3970.44]  against one another.
[3972.58 --> 3974.12]  Now imagine with me this.
[3974.48 --> 3975.20]  Imagine if instead
[3975.20 --> 3975.68]  of grumbling,
[3975.94 --> 3977.30]  we used this time,
[3977.56 --> 3978.28]  this pandemic
[3978.28 --> 3979.58]  that we find ourselves in,
[3979.74 --> 3980.42]  and we spoke
[3980.42 --> 3981.52]  not of the restrictions
[3981.52 --> 3982.96]  or the policies in place
[3982.96 --> 3984.02]  or vaccinations
[3984.02 --> 3984.58]  or masks
[3984.58 --> 3985.28]  or about any of that,
[3985.38 --> 3986.82]  but if we spoke instead
[3986.82 --> 3988.74]  about God's goodness
[3988.74 --> 3990.42]  in our lives.
[3990.42 --> 3992.12]  What if instead
[3992.12 --> 3993.38]  of grumbling
[3993.38 --> 3993.94]  about people
[3993.94 --> 3994.66]  who think differently
[3994.66 --> 3995.20]  than you do,
[3995.38 --> 3996.38]  we celebrated
[3996.38 --> 3997.32]  the work
[3997.32 --> 3998.62]  that God is doing
[3998.62 --> 3999.84]  in our lives,
[3999.98 --> 4000.74]  in the lives
[4000.74 --> 4001.42]  of our friends,
[4001.78 --> 4002.68]  in the lives
[4002.68 --> 4003.62]  of the community
[4003.62 --> 4005.06]  that you find yourself in.
[4006.98 --> 4008.38]  We are to be patient
[4008.38 --> 4010.22]  and to speak in truth
[4010.22 --> 4011.34]  about the goodness
[4011.34 --> 4012.68]  of God,
[4012.88 --> 4013.76]  the greatness
[4013.76 --> 4015.08]  of His mercy,
[4015.32 --> 4015.92]  the wonder
[4015.92 --> 4016.80]  of His rule
[4016.80 --> 4017.94]  in our lives
[4017.94 --> 4019.12]  no matter what context
[4019.12 --> 4020.18]  we find ourselves in.
[4021.94 --> 4023.74]  Times of struggle
[4023.74 --> 4025.86]  are golden opportunities
[4025.86 --> 4027.58]  for us to speak
[4027.58 --> 4029.62]  to the glory of God.
[4031.82 --> 4033.06]  What if rather than
[4033.06 --> 4035.38]  grumbling against one another,
[4036.02 --> 4038.30]  we praised Him
[4038.30 --> 4040.76]  by encouraging one another?
[4041.30 --> 4042.10]  What a difference
[4042.10 --> 4043.16]  that would make.
[4044.70 --> 4046.04]  The end of this pandemic
[4046.04 --> 4046.68]  is close,
[4046.80 --> 4047.38]  and so perhaps
[4047.38 --> 4048.26]  it's a little easier
[4048.26 --> 4048.96]  for us now
[4048.96 --> 4049.94]  to be patient
[4049.94 --> 4050.72]  in the midst
[4050.72 --> 4051.70]  of these restrictions
[4051.70 --> 4053.08]  because we know
[4053.08 --> 4054.54]  that the end
[4054.54 --> 4055.58]  of this is near.
[4055.64 --> 4056.08]  When the end
[4056.08 --> 4056.96]  of something is coming,
[4057.04 --> 4057.82]  it becomes a little bit
[4057.82 --> 4058.64]  easier for us
[4058.64 --> 4059.74]  to be patient,
[4060.10 --> 4060.82]  to persevere,
[4060.98 --> 4061.58]  and this too
[4061.58 --> 4062.46]  is James' point.
[4062.88 --> 4063.88]  We're to be patient,
[4064.30 --> 4065.32]  as verse 8 says,
[4065.42 --> 4066.20]  because the coming
[4066.20 --> 4067.34]  of the Lord
[4067.34 --> 4068.20]  is at hand.
[4070.62 --> 4071.06]  Now,
[4071.10 --> 4071.48]  if you're part
[4071.48 --> 4071.98]  of a church,
[4072.30 --> 4073.14]  part of this church
[4073.14 --> 4074.22]  or another church perhaps,
[4074.36 --> 4075.20]  if you're a believer
[4075.20 --> 4076.38]  in Christ,
[4076.52 --> 4077.48]  you know that Jesus
[4077.48 --> 4078.48]  came.
[4079.02 --> 4079.94]  You know He lived,
[4080.44 --> 4081.22]  you know He died
[4081.22 --> 4082.34]  and He rose again.
[4082.66 --> 4083.30]  Jesus lived
[4083.30 --> 4083.92]  and He fulfilled
[4083.92 --> 4084.60]  His ministry
[4084.60 --> 4085.18]  here on earth.
[4085.18 --> 4086.34]  But brothers and sisters,
[4086.52 --> 4088.26]  we also know
[4088.26 --> 4089.82]  that He will come again.
[4090.86 --> 4092.30]  His kingdom has come,
[4092.40 --> 4093.14]  but His kingdom
[4093.14 --> 4093.70]  is coming.
[4094.84 --> 4095.82]  We await
[4095.82 --> 4097.62]  His inevitable return,
[4097.62 --> 4099.42]  and we know
[4099.42 --> 4100.48]  the end
[4100.48 --> 4101.50]  is near.
[4102.46 --> 4103.08]  The end of this
[4103.08 --> 4104.02]  pandemic is near,
[4104.14 --> 4104.32]  sure,
[4104.52 --> 4105.38]  and we can celebrate
[4105.38 --> 4106.30]  that because that's
[4106.30 --> 4106.66]  wonderful,
[4106.96 --> 4108.08]  but how much greater
[4108.08 --> 4109.10]  is the knowledge
[4109.10 --> 4109.72]  that Jesus
[4109.72 --> 4111.44]  is coming again
[4111.44 --> 4112.78]  to remove all sin,
[4113.10 --> 4113.78]  all disease,
[4114.00 --> 4114.86]  all pandemic
[4114.86 --> 4116.64]  for all of time?
[4117.62 --> 4118.56]  That's what James
[4118.56 --> 4119.54]  wants us to hear today.
[4119.84 --> 4120.32]  The coming
[4120.32 --> 4121.24]  of the Lord
[4121.24 --> 4122.22]  is at hand.
[4122.58 --> 4123.24]  Be patient.
[4124.32 --> 4125.50]  Like a good book
[4125.50 --> 4126.38]  that we've read
[4126.38 --> 4127.62]  over and over again,
[4128.04 --> 4129.06]  knowing the end
[4129.06 --> 4130.80]  just makes that book
[4130.80 --> 4131.48]  so much better.
[4132.18 --> 4132.82]  We know
[4132.82 --> 4134.50]  the end of the story.
[4136.02 --> 4137.16]  Christ is coming back.
[4137.54 --> 4138.56]  He will reign
[4138.56 --> 4139.50]  in the new earth
[4139.50 --> 4140.42]  forever.
[4140.84 --> 4141.26]  There will be
[4141.26 --> 4142.22]  no more sorrow,
[4142.64 --> 4143.72]  no more pain,
[4143.98 --> 4145.16]  no more disease
[4145.16 --> 4146.02]  or pandemics
[4146.02 --> 4146.54]  or grief,
[4146.80 --> 4148.28]  no more anxiety
[4148.28 --> 4149.60]  or depression
[4149.60 --> 4150.84]  or sadness.
[4151.34 --> 4152.32]  Poverty will end.
[4152.94 --> 4154.38]  Injustice will end.
[4154.78 --> 4156.16]  Death will end.
[4156.42 --> 4156.66]  Instead,
[4156.78 --> 4157.42]  there will be comfort.
[4158.24 --> 4159.14]  There will be joy.
[4159.14 --> 4160.78]  There will be health
[4160.78 --> 4161.70]  and freedom
[4161.70 --> 4162.62]  and peace.
[4162.94 --> 4163.90]  We will be confident
[4163.90 --> 4164.82]  in our God
[4164.82 --> 4165.76]  and happy
[4165.76 --> 4167.18]  and satisfied.
[4167.84 --> 4169.10]  Abundance will reign.
[4169.56 --> 4170.30]  Justice will be
[4170.30 --> 4171.06]  all we know
[4171.06 --> 4172.08]  and life
[4172.08 --> 4173.52]  will be all
[4173.52 --> 4174.48]  there is.
[4175.78 --> 4177.18]  We will unite
[4177.18 --> 4178.12]  with all of those
[4178.12 --> 4179.00]  that call Christ
[4179.00 --> 4179.78]  as Lord
[4179.78 --> 4180.66]  and live together
[4180.66 --> 4182.20]  in one perfect,
[4182.62 --> 4184.06]  beautiful body,
[4184.40 --> 4185.32]  free of pain
[4185.32 --> 4186.36]  and sin
[4186.36 --> 4187.28]  and death
[4187.28 --> 4188.14]  forever,
[4188.46 --> 4189.18]  free to run
[4189.18 --> 4190.00]  and play
[4190.00 --> 4190.66]  and laugh
[4190.66 --> 4191.50]  and sing
[4191.50 --> 4192.76]  and dance
[4192.76 --> 4193.40]  and fish
[4193.40 --> 4194.04]  and golf
[4194.04 --> 4194.68]  and swim
[4194.68 --> 4195.64]  and rest
[4195.64 --> 4196.80]  and do all
[4196.80 --> 4197.40]  of the things
[4197.40 --> 4198.82]  we love to do
[4198.82 --> 4201.18]  all in the presence
[4201.18 --> 4202.24]  of the one
[4202.24 --> 4203.88]  true God
[4203.88 --> 4205.74]  who we will live with
[4205.74 --> 4206.74]  and worship
[4206.74 --> 4208.82]  and be in awe of
[4208.82 --> 4209.86]  forever.
[4209.86 --> 4210.00]  forever.
[4212.82 --> 4213.84]  We know
[4213.84 --> 4214.70]  how our story
[4214.70 --> 4215.36]  ends.
[4216.54 --> 4217.58]  The spring rains
[4217.58 --> 4218.28]  are coming.
[4219.62 --> 4220.88]  Christ is coming.
[4222.24 --> 4223.06]  We long
[4223.06 --> 4223.82]  for that day.
[4225.72 --> 4227.10]  But while we long
[4227.10 --> 4227.94]  for that day,
[4228.62 --> 4230.02]  we are called
[4230.02 --> 4231.80]  to be patient.
[4231.80 --> 4234.38]  to work,
[4234.60 --> 4235.54]  to be diligent,
[4235.68 --> 4236.40]  to be faithful,
[4237.44 --> 4239.08]  but to be patient
[4239.08 --> 4241.78]  and not grumble,
[4242.24 --> 4243.14]  but rejoice
[4243.14 --> 4244.80]  in the glory
[4244.80 --> 4245.72]  of God's
[4245.72 --> 4246.20]  kingdom
[4246.20 --> 4247.06]  coming.
[4249.96 --> 4250.58]  So while James
[4250.58 --> 4251.82]  calls us to be patient
[4251.82 --> 4252.60]  like the farmer,
[4252.68 --> 4253.62]  he also calls us
[4253.62 --> 4254.58]  to persevere
[4254.58 --> 4255.78]  like the prophet.
[4256.06 --> 4256.78]  The Old Testament
[4256.78 --> 4257.92]  prophets experienced
[4257.92 --> 4259.34]  tremendous hardships.
[4259.58 --> 4260.40]  Hardships we can't
[4260.40 --> 4261.26]  even fully grasp.
[4261.26 --> 4262.54]  And they experienced
[4262.54 --> 4263.24]  these hardships
[4263.24 --> 4264.32]  all in the name
[4264.32 --> 4265.24]  of the Lord.
[4266.20 --> 4267.16]  No one exemplifies
[4267.16 --> 4267.70]  this perhaps
[4267.70 --> 4268.60]  more than Jeremiah
[4268.60 --> 4269.66]  who is actually
[4269.66 --> 4270.28]  known as the
[4270.28 --> 4271.60]  weeping prophet
[4271.60 --> 4272.30]  because he had
[4272.30 --> 4273.02]  to persevere
[4273.02 --> 4274.36]  so much.
[4274.84 --> 4275.36]  Jeremiah was
[4275.36 --> 4276.12]  severely beaten.
[4276.48 --> 4277.08]  He was put in
[4277.08 --> 4278.18]  those torture stocks
[4278.18 --> 4279.46]  outside of a city gate.
[4279.82 --> 4280.40]  He was thrown
[4280.40 --> 4281.22]  into a well.
[4281.74 --> 4282.50]  He was eventually
[4282.50 --> 4284.06]  stoned to death.
[4285.24 --> 4286.14]  If you read his book
[4286.14 --> 4286.82]  in the Bible,
[4286.94 --> 4287.12]  I mean,
[4287.14 --> 4288.24]  it's 52 chapters.
[4288.38 --> 4289.14]  It's a long book,
[4289.30 --> 4289.82]  but that's the point.
[4289.82 --> 4291.32]  It's 52 chapters
[4291.32 --> 4292.22]  of Jeremiah
[4292.22 --> 4293.26]  suffering
[4293.26 --> 4295.64]  for the glory
[4295.64 --> 4296.04]  of God.
[4297.32 --> 4297.92]  To say Jeremiah
[4297.92 --> 4298.84]  lived a hard life
[4298.84 --> 4299.70]  does a disservice
[4299.70 --> 4300.36]  to the life
[4300.36 --> 4301.00]  that he lived
[4301.00 --> 4301.78]  and the trials
[4301.78 --> 4302.46]  and tribulations
[4302.46 --> 4303.08]  that he faced
[4303.08 --> 4303.52]  every day.
[4304.68 --> 4305.52]  James also
[4305.52 --> 4307.24]  lists Job.
[4308.40 --> 4309.20]  Job who
[4309.20 --> 4310.28]  lost everything.
[4311.84 --> 4312.90]  Everything he owned,
[4313.02 --> 4313.60]  his family,
[4313.78 --> 4314.18]  his health.
[4314.18 --> 4317.82]  And yet he remained
[4317.82 --> 4318.64]  faithful to God.
[4318.82 --> 4319.46]  He was blessed
[4319.46 --> 4320.86]  and he was blessed
[4320.86 --> 4321.80]  for his faithfulness.
[4323.14 --> 4323.96]  Jeremiah and Job,
[4324.04 --> 4324.52]  they suffered,
[4324.66 --> 4325.90]  but they persevered.
[4326.30 --> 4327.16]  They persevered
[4327.16 --> 4328.02]  because they too
[4328.02 --> 4328.98]  knew the end
[4328.98 --> 4329.56]  of the story.
[4329.92 --> 4330.70]  Job knew God
[4330.70 --> 4331.30]  was faithful.
[4332.10 --> 4332.96]  Jeremiah knew
[4332.96 --> 4334.32]  that a Messiah
[4334.32 --> 4335.32]  was coming.
[4336.40 --> 4337.08]  To him,
[4337.14 --> 4337.64]  the Messiah
[4337.64 --> 4338.62]  was coming
[4338.62 --> 4339.78]  to restore his people.
[4339.94 --> 4340.60]  But we know
[4340.60 --> 4341.12]  even better.
[4341.96 --> 4342.46]  We know that
[4342.46 --> 4342.92]  the Messiah
[4342.92 --> 4343.62]  has come.
[4344.66 --> 4345.12]  And not just
[4345.12 --> 4345.94]  to restore his people,
[4346.02 --> 4347.18]  but to restore everything.
[4348.94 --> 4349.90]  Jesus Christ,
[4350.06 --> 4350.78]  he lived
[4350.78 --> 4351.90]  a perfect life
[4351.90 --> 4352.58]  which we all
[4352.58 --> 4353.74]  fall short of living.
[4354.06 --> 4354.86]  And then he died
[4354.86 --> 4355.32]  a death
[4355.32 --> 4355.96]  that you
[4355.96 --> 4356.64]  and that I
[4356.64 --> 4357.24]  and that all
[4357.24 --> 4357.86]  who sinned
[4357.86 --> 4359.30]  deserve to die.
[4359.64 --> 4360.68]  But he took our place
[4360.68 --> 4361.92]  and he atoned
[4361.92 --> 4362.70]  for our sin
[4362.70 --> 4363.92]  and he rose again
[4363.92 --> 4364.52]  from the grave
[4364.52 --> 4365.76]  victorious over sin
[4365.76 --> 4366.82]  and over death
[4366.82 --> 4368.00]  and now he reigns
[4368.00 --> 4368.76]  at the right hand
[4368.76 --> 4369.66]  of God the Father
[4369.66 --> 4370.18]  Almighty.
[4370.36 --> 4370.86]  His kingdom
[4370.86 --> 4371.74]  has come
[4371.74 --> 4372.78]  and we wait
[4372.78 --> 4373.54]  patiently
[4373.54 --> 4374.86]  for his kingdom's
[4374.86 --> 4375.54]  final coming.
[4376.36 --> 4376.88]  The end
[4376.88 --> 4377.56]  is near.
[4378.74 --> 4379.60]  But we must
[4379.60 --> 4380.32]  persevere
[4380.32 --> 4381.34]  in this life
[4381.34 --> 4382.02]  as we wait
[4382.02 --> 4382.58]  patiently,
[4383.04 --> 4383.70]  rumble free
[4383.70 --> 4384.68]  for his coming.
[4387.48 --> 4388.12]  Now,
[4388.36 --> 4389.36]  this message
[4389.36 --> 4390.48]  is not meant
[4390.48 --> 4391.16]  to belittle
[4391.16 --> 4391.90]  the context
[4391.90 --> 4393.16]  that you find yourself in.
[4394.12 --> 4395.66]  Life is hard.
[4395.98 --> 4397.14]  People suffer.
[4397.26 --> 4398.00]  You might be watching
[4398.00 --> 4398.62]  right now
[4398.62 --> 4399.72]  and are going through
[4399.72 --> 4400.54]  a tremendously
[4400.54 --> 4401.56]  difficult time.
[4402.22 --> 4403.38]  And I do not mean
[4403.38 --> 4404.20]  to minimize
[4404.20 --> 4405.00]  your struggles
[4405.00 --> 4406.12]  or to undermine
[4406.12 --> 4406.78]  your pain.
[4408.56 --> 4409.16]  Patience
[4409.16 --> 4410.28]  and perseverance
[4410.28 --> 4411.30]  in the midst
[4411.30 --> 4412.00]  of sorrow
[4412.00 --> 4413.22]  or grief
[4413.22 --> 4414.40]  or pain
[4414.40 --> 4415.20]  or anxiety
[4415.20 --> 4416.30]  is not just hard,
[4416.38 --> 4417.16]  it can be crippling.
[4417.16 --> 4420.50]  And yet,
[4420.60 --> 4421.54]  James mentions
[4421.54 --> 4422.32]  these prophets
[4422.32 --> 4424.08]  to highlight
[4424.08 --> 4425.82]  that persevering
[4425.82 --> 4427.32]  is possible.
[4430.42 --> 4430.82]  Prophets
[4430.82 --> 4431.40]  have suffered
[4431.40 --> 4432.16]  and responded
[4432.16 --> 4432.88]  to suffering
[4432.88 --> 4434.06]  faithfully before
[4434.06 --> 4434.92]  with the right
[4434.92 --> 4435.50]  perspective.
[4435.86 --> 4436.68]  Our sinful nature
[4436.68 --> 4437.96]  sometimes leads us
[4437.96 --> 4438.48]  to assume
[4438.48 --> 4439.64]  that we are the first
[4439.64 --> 4441.08]  to ever truly
[4441.08 --> 4441.84]  experience
[4441.84 --> 4442.62]  what we are going
[4442.62 --> 4442.98]  for
[4442.98 --> 4443.92]  or what we are
[4443.92 --> 4444.42]  going through.
[4444.42 --> 4445.04]  But James
[4445.04 --> 4445.74]  wants his readers
[4445.74 --> 4446.30]  to know
[4446.30 --> 4447.96]  and he wants
[4447.96 --> 4448.34]  his readers
[4448.34 --> 4449.22]  to be very clear
[4449.22 --> 4449.92]  that while
[4449.92 --> 4451.34]  what they are facing
[4451.34 --> 4454.12]  is by no means easy,
[4454.94 --> 4456.74]  it's also not new.
[4458.08 --> 4460.02]  We fall on hard times.
[4461.64 --> 4463.08]  We will find ourselves
[4463.08 --> 4463.86]  in situations
[4463.86 --> 4464.62]  and contexts
[4464.62 --> 4465.30]  that are difficult.
[4466.38 --> 4467.54]  But the prophets
[4467.54 --> 4468.34]  persevered
[4468.34 --> 4470.30]  and we can too.
[4470.40 --> 4471.14]  With our eyes
[4471.14 --> 4471.88]  on the Lord
[4471.88 --> 4473.18]  and with the Spirit's help,
[4473.18 --> 4474.76]  we can persevere.
[4475.66 --> 4476.76]  We have examples
[4476.76 --> 4477.76]  of this in our lives.
[4477.84 --> 4478.58]  All of us do.
[4478.88 --> 4479.72]  Examples beyond
[4479.72 --> 4480.22]  the prophets
[4480.22 --> 4480.98]  of the Old Testament.
[4481.60 --> 4482.26]  For me personally,
[4482.32 --> 4483.14]  I think of my grandma.
[4484.34 --> 4485.52]  My grandma was widowed
[4485.52 --> 4486.90]  three times in her life.
[4487.94 --> 4488.54]  She was widowed
[4488.54 --> 4489.40]  in her 30s
[4489.40 --> 4489.98]  when she had
[4489.98 --> 4491.08]  four young daughters
[4491.08 --> 4491.62]  in the house.
[4492.56 --> 4493.44]  She got remarried
[4493.44 --> 4494.34]  and was widowed
[4494.34 --> 4496.16]  not 12 years later
[4496.16 --> 4497.22]  with now five
[4497.22 --> 4498.10]  teenage daughters
[4498.10 --> 4498.76]  in the house.
[4499.90 --> 4500.92]  She remarried again,
[4501.20 --> 4502.22]  moved back to Holland,
[4502.22 --> 4505.56]  came back to Canada
[4505.56 --> 4506.38]  with her new husband,
[4507.06 --> 4508.22]  and was widowed
[4508.22 --> 4509.06]  a third time,
[4509.14 --> 4510.12]  this time later in life
[4510.12 --> 4510.80]  in her 80s.
[4510.84 --> 4511.44]  She immigrated
[4511.44 --> 4512.08]  from Holland
[4512.08 --> 4513.30]  to Canada twice
[4513.30 --> 4514.14]  in her life,
[4514.44 --> 4515.40]  moved more than anyone
[4515.40 --> 4515.96]  should have,
[4516.00 --> 4516.78]  and not only did she
[4516.78 --> 4518.24]  survive three husbands,
[4518.74 --> 4519.64]  she also survived
[4519.64 --> 4520.38]  her one daughter
[4520.38 --> 4521.36]  who passed away young
[4521.36 --> 4522.74]  and several grandkids.
[4524.04 --> 4525.26]  God finally called her
[4525.26 --> 4526.98]  to her eternal home
[4526.98 --> 4528.48]  about 10 years ago.
[4528.48 --> 4530.76]  but she persevered.
[4531.28 --> 4532.10]  Her faith legacy
[4532.10 --> 4534.36]  lives on in me,
[4534.50 --> 4535.30]  in our family,
[4535.30 --> 4536.40]  and she was as good
[4536.40 --> 4536.98]  of an example
[4536.98 --> 4537.58]  as patience
[4537.58 --> 4538.38]  and perseverance
[4538.38 --> 4539.44]  that I have ever seen.
[4540.44 --> 4542.62]  Our family is so much closer,
[4543.16 --> 4545.38]  and we know of God's love
[4545.38 --> 4546.18]  so much more
[4546.18 --> 4548.28]  because of her perseverance
[4548.28 --> 4549.58]  in the trials
[4549.58 --> 4550.72]  of this life.
[4550.72 --> 4553.66]  More recently,
[4553.76 --> 4554.60]  I remember Pastor Bill
[4554.60 --> 4555.26]  who was diagnosed
[4555.26 --> 4555.90]  with cancer,
[4556.02 --> 4556.28]  of course,
[4556.32 --> 4557.02]  when he was still
[4557.02 --> 4558.46]  the pastor of this church
[4558.46 --> 4559.36]  over 10 years ago.
[4560.62 --> 4561.82]  As he persevered
[4561.82 --> 4563.10]  through his cancer diagnosis
[4563.10 --> 4563.84]  that made his health
[4563.84 --> 4565.06]  decline so rapidly,
[4566.00 --> 4566.90]  he praised God
[4566.90 --> 4567.66]  in the midst of it.
[4568.34 --> 4569.98]  He prayed for his church.
[4570.08 --> 4570.98]  He loved his church.
[4571.22 --> 4572.26]  He blessed and prayed
[4572.26 --> 4573.06]  for those who went
[4573.06 --> 4573.78]  to visit him
[4573.78 --> 4575.42]  to pray and bless him.
[4575.42 --> 4577.94]  And he passed away
[4577.94 --> 4579.08]  knowing with certainty
[4579.08 --> 4581.30]  that the end of his story
[4581.30 --> 4581.92]  was going to be
[4581.92 --> 4583.16]  a glorious and eternal one.
[4584.80 --> 4586.12]  And even most recently,
[4586.26 --> 4586.76]  we all remember
[4586.76 --> 4587.52]  Dave Alexander
[4587.52 --> 4589.22]  who walked alongside
[4589.22 --> 4589.94]  Pastor Bill
[4589.94 --> 4591.02]  10 years ago
[4591.02 --> 4591.94]  before he had been,
[4592.14 --> 4593.16]  before Dave was diagnosed
[4593.16 --> 4593.84]  with ALS.
[4594.44 --> 4595.14]  As he journeyed
[4595.14 --> 4596.50]  through his ALS diagnosis,
[4597.10 --> 4597.92]  Dave told me regularly
[4597.92 --> 4598.60]  that he wanted
[4598.60 --> 4599.62]  to be like Bill
[4599.62 --> 4601.42]  and persevere
[4601.42 --> 4602.18]  in his suffering
[4602.18 --> 4603.54]  too to be an example
[4603.54 --> 4604.36]  of God's glory
[4604.36 --> 4605.10]  to his community.
[4606.40 --> 4607.22]  He also blessed
[4607.22 --> 4607.84]  and he prayed
[4607.84 --> 4608.46]  for those
[4608.46 --> 4609.88]  who came to visit him.
[4609.94 --> 4610.82]  And while his body
[4610.82 --> 4611.44]  failed him,
[4611.90 --> 4612.94]  he eventually passed.
[4613.52 --> 4614.56]  So many were brought
[4614.56 --> 4615.40]  closer to Christ
[4615.40 --> 4617.12]  because of Dave's perseverance.
[4619.34 --> 4620.26]  Along with these,
[4620.34 --> 4621.26]  you all have others.
[4621.38 --> 4622.36]  You have your own examples
[4622.36 --> 4622.82]  of people
[4622.82 --> 4623.94]  who have persevered
[4623.94 --> 4624.54]  through the faith,
[4625.28 --> 4626.78]  persevered through trials
[4626.78 --> 4627.56]  and tribulations,
[4628.04 --> 4628.76]  but persevered
[4628.76 --> 4629.82]  for the glory of God.
[4630.88 --> 4632.24]  Like Job and Jeremiah
[4632.24 --> 4632.82]  and the prophets,
[4632.96 --> 4633.88]  they all persevered.
[4634.00 --> 4634.82]  As James says
[4634.82 --> 4635.54]  in our text today,
[4635.84 --> 4636.84]  we know that they
[4636.84 --> 4637.48]  are blessed
[4637.48 --> 4639.12]  for they remain
[4639.12 --> 4640.38]  dead fast.
[4642.28 --> 4642.92]  And so like those
[4642.92 --> 4643.80]  who have gone before us,
[4643.86 --> 4644.58]  we are called
[4644.58 --> 4646.02]  to patience
[4646.02 --> 4647.18]  and perseverance.
[4647.18 --> 4650.54]  you know what you're going through.
[4653.48 --> 4654.56]  You know what may be
[4654.56 --> 4655.38]  causing you grief.
[4655.52 --> 4656.66]  You know what's causing you
[4656.66 --> 4657.68]  trials.
[4658.44 --> 4659.40]  You may know
[4659.40 --> 4660.52]  what's causing you
[4660.52 --> 4662.42]  to feel crippled.
[4663.16 --> 4664.82]  But may you also know
[4664.82 --> 4666.02]  the end of this story.
[4667.16 --> 4668.30]  May you know
[4668.30 --> 4669.50]  of Christ's victory
[4669.50 --> 4670.36]  in his life,
[4670.64 --> 4670.88]  death,
[4671.16 --> 4671.76]  and resurrection.
[4672.24 --> 4673.04]  May you know
[4673.04 --> 4673.90]  that the king
[4673.90 --> 4674.66]  has come
[4674.66 --> 4675.88]  and is coming.
[4677.12 --> 4677.92]  May you know
[4677.92 --> 4679.14]  that his kingdom
[4679.14 --> 4680.68]  is the end
[4680.68 --> 4681.78]  of the story.
[4682.28 --> 4682.96]  God is not about
[4682.96 --> 4684.06]  making life hard for us.
[4684.30 --> 4685.46]  But when life is hard,
[4685.72 --> 4686.42]  we can trust
[4686.42 --> 4687.54]  in his eternal promises,
[4688.04 --> 4688.88]  trust in the story
[4688.88 --> 4689.94]  we already know
[4689.94 --> 4691.04]  the end to.
[4691.74 --> 4692.58]  And this perspective
[4692.58 --> 4693.60]  will help us persevere.
[4694.14 --> 4695.06]  If we think of
[4695.06 --> 4696.08]  God's kingdom coming,
[4697.10 --> 4698.68]  death is still difficult.
[4698.68 --> 4700.28]  But grieving
[4700.28 --> 4701.34]  becomes a little easier.
[4702.34 --> 4703.22]  If we think of
[4703.22 --> 4704.10]  God's kingdom coming,
[4704.52 --> 4705.54]  persecution is still
[4705.54 --> 4706.02]  challenging.
[4707.16 --> 4708.22]  But bearing it
[4708.22 --> 4709.30]  becomes a little less so.
[4710.58 --> 4711.58]  If we think of
[4711.58 --> 4712.58]  God's kingdom coming,
[4713.48 --> 4714.34]  trials are still
[4714.34 --> 4715.26]  hard to overcome.
[4716.38 --> 4717.62]  But persevering
[4717.62 --> 4718.76]  becomes a lot more feasible.
[4720.04 --> 4721.14]  Christ's kingdom
[4721.14 --> 4722.20]  has come.
[4723.60 --> 4724.42]  Christ's kingdom
[4724.42 --> 4724.98]  is coming.
[4726.28 --> 4726.94]  Let us practice
[4726.94 --> 4728.18]  patience and perseverance
[4728.18 --> 4729.26]  as we wait
[4729.26 --> 4730.86]  and work
[4730.86 --> 4732.38]  for the glory
[4732.38 --> 4733.54]  of God.
[4733.64 --> 4734.06]  Let's pray.
[4737.30 --> 4738.08]  Father God,
[4738.12 --> 4739.00]  we are so grateful
[4739.00 --> 4739.98]  for this story.
[4740.74 --> 4741.94]  The story that we know
[4741.94 --> 4742.70]  the end to.
[4743.12 --> 4744.46]  The story of your sons
[4744.46 --> 4745.04]  coming
[4745.04 --> 4746.38]  and dying
[4746.38 --> 4748.48]  and raising to life,
[4748.56 --> 4749.46]  defeating sin and death.
[4750.94 --> 4751.62]  And God,
[4751.68 --> 4753.44]  as we live in this life
[4753.44 --> 4754.54]  in contexts
[4754.54 --> 4755.66]  that are out of our control
[4755.66 --> 4756.46]  with struggles
[4757.14 --> 4758.02]  and pain
[4758.02 --> 4760.54]  and all sorts of trials
[4760.54 --> 4761.20]  and tribulations
[4761.20 --> 4762.14]  in our lives, God.
[4763.02 --> 4764.62]  We ask for your spirit's help.
[4766.18 --> 4767.22]  Root us in patience.
[4768.18 --> 4769.30]  Drive us to perseverance.
[4770.58 --> 4772.04]  And may we always do this
[4772.04 --> 4773.06]  seeking you first,
[4773.30 --> 4773.60]  knowing
[4773.60 --> 4775.16]  that you are coming.
[4776.00 --> 4777.24]  We pray this in your name.
[4777.76 --> 4778.02]  Amen.
[4778.02 --> 4778.12]  Amen.

[5013.42 --> 5042.08]  My God, Lord, our, Lord, for my God
[5042.08 --> 5048.84]  I want you to have a seat together.
[5051.96 --> 5056.70]  This time we're going to come to the table of our Lord.
[5056.70 --> 5062.80]  And God really gives us this feast to help us persevere for the glory of his kingdom.
[5063.52 --> 5068.28]  He gives us this feast as an anticipation of that kingdom come and that kingdom coming,
[5068.28 --> 5073.06]  wherein we will celebrate with the heavenly banquet of our king.
[5073.34 --> 5077.26]  This is a foretaste of that for us.
[5077.46 --> 5082.58]  This is meant to sustain us in that journey of faith.
[5083.62 --> 5086.34]  To come to this table, we're going to move through a bit of a liturgy.
[5086.46 --> 5088.08]  You'll see that on the screen over there.
[5088.14 --> 5094.18]  There's some responsive parts, and so you are, of course, invited to speak those parts as you see them on the screen.
[5094.18 --> 5102.68]  And then when it comes time to take and to eat or drink, of course, you may remove your masks to accomplish that in our time together.
[5103.98 --> 5105.58]  Lift up your hearts.
[5108.84 --> 5111.48]  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
[5111.48 --> 5120.04]  With joy, we praise you, gracious God.
[5120.60 --> 5124.56]  For you have created us in your image.
[5125.28 --> 5128.66]  And you have kept covenant with us, even when we fell into sin.
[5129.32 --> 5132.92]  We give you thanks for Jesus Christ, our Lord,
[5132.92 --> 5140.82]  who by his life, death, and resurrection opened to us the way of everlasting life.
[5141.48 --> 5152.02]  Therefore, we join our voices with all the saints and all the angels and the whole of creation to proclaim the glory of your name.
[5153.20 --> 5164.52]  We give thanks to God the Father that our Savior, Jesus Christ, before he suffered, gave us this memorial of his sacrifice until he comes again.
[5164.52 --> 5175.50]  At his last supper, the Lord Jesus took bread.
[5176.40 --> 5179.84]  And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[5180.22 --> 5183.92]  This is my body, which is for you.
[5184.68 --> 5187.56]  Do this in remembrance of me.
[5187.56 --> 5192.68]  And in the same way, he took the cup after supper.
[5193.44 --> 5194.32]  And he said,
[5194.32 --> 5197.80]  This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[5198.74 --> 5201.34]  Do this in remembrance of me.
[5202.20 --> 5205.50]  For whenever we eat this bread and drink this cup,
[5205.94 --> 5209.72]  we proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.
[5210.44 --> 5217.04]  Therefore, we proclaim our faith assigned and sealed in this sacrament.
[5217.56 --> 5222.86]  Christ has died.
[5224.02 --> 5224.74]  Christ is risen.
[5225.70 --> 5226.70]  Christ will come again.
[5228.78 --> 5229.60]  Church family,
[5230.02 --> 5236.76]  The Lord has prepared his table for all who love him and all who trust in him alone for their salvation.
[5236.76 --> 5239.84]  If you are truly sorry for your sins,
[5240.18 --> 5242.80]  sincerely believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior,
[5242.90 --> 5245.28]  and if you desire to live in obedience to him,
[5245.54 --> 5249.18]  whether you are here in the sanctuary or at home with your families,
[5249.32 --> 5254.60]  you are now invited to come with gladness to the table of our Lord.
[5255.52 --> 5259.16]  The gifts of God for the people of God.

[5260.38 --> 5266.00]  Osh one,

[5276.82 --> 5277.30]  I don't have any Stu.
[5277.30 --> 5278.08]  I rise up high.
[5278.48 --> 5279.30]  I pray,

[5279.62 --> 5280.82]  but I touch.
[5280.82 --> 5281.26]  Holy hope.
[5281.26 --> 5281.46]  How do I tell you?

[5376.04 --> 5406.02]  Thank you.
[5406.04 --> 5436.02]  Thank you.
[5436.04 --> 5466.02]  Thank you.
