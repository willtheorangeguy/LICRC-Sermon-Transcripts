[0.00 --> 9.58]  I'm now in place
[9.58 --> 13.06]  From when I rise up in the morning
[13.06 --> 16.00]  Till I leave my head to rest
[16.54 --> 19.00]  I feel you near me
[19.62 --> 23.94]  You see me when I'm weary
[23.94 --> 29.98]  Oh Lord, for all the worst and all the best
[30.00 --> 37.96]  Oh Lord, for all the worst and all the best
[38.80 --> 38.98]  Me
[38.98 --> 47.86]  Oh, yeah
[68.98 --> 90.96]  Here I am, Lord, and I'm drowning in your sea of forgetfulness.
[90.96 --> 95.08]  The chains of yesterday surround me.
[95.64 --> 97.86]  I yearn for peace and rest.
[97.86 --> 101.66]  I don't want to end up where you found me
[101.66 --> 104.58]  And it echoes in my mind
[104.58 --> 107.90]  It keeps me awake tonight
[107.90 --> 114.44]  I know you've cast my sin as far
[114.44 --> 117.62]  The east is from the west
[117.62 --> 121.02]  And I stand before you now
[121.02 --> 124.24]  As though I've never sinned
[124.24 --> 128.76]  But today I feel like I'm just one mistake away
[128.76 --> 132.44]  From you leaving me this way
[132.44 --> 138.10]  Jesus, can you show me just how far
[138.10 --> 140.78]  The east is from the west
[140.78 --> 146.30]  Cause I can't bear to see the man I've been
[146.30 --> 149.72]  Rising up in me again
[149.72 --> 154.02]  In the arms of your mercy I find red
[154.02 --> 158.54]  Cause you know just how far the east is
[158.54 --> 160.12]  From the west is from the west
[160.12 --> 163.06]  One scarred hand to the other
[163.06 --> 180.04]  I start the day the war begins
[180.04 --> 183.22]  Endless reminding of my sin
[183.22 --> 184.80]  Time and time again
[184.80 --> 185.54]  Time and time again
[185.54 --> 187.86]  Your truth is drowned out
[187.86 --> 189.80]  By the storm I'm in
[189.80 --> 194.60]  Today I feel like I'm just one mistake away
[194.60 --> 198.22]  From you leaving me this way
[198.22 --> 201.74]  Jesus, can you show me
[201.74 --> 206.26]  Just how far the east is
[206.26 --> 207.26]  Just how far the east is
[207.26 --> 208.32]  From the west
[208.32 --> 212.06]  Cause I can't bear to see the man I've been
[212.06 --> 215.38]  Come rising up in me again
[215.38 --> 220.26]  In the arms of your mercy I find red
[220.26 --> 224.78]  Cause you know just how far the east is
[224.78 --> 225.78]  From the west
[225.78 --> 228.78]  One scarred hand to the other
[228.78 --> 232.78]  I know you've washed me white
[232.78 --> 236.22]  Turned my darkness into light
[236.22 --> 239.74]  I need your peace to get me through
[239.74 --> 242.74]  Get me through this night
[242.74 --> 245.86]  I can't live by what I feel
[245.86 --> 248.74]  But by the truth your word reveals
[248.74 --> 252.32]  I'm not holding on to you
[252.32 --> 256.20]  But you're holding on to me
[256.20 --> 263.96]  You're holding on to me
[263.96 --> 270.92]  Jesus, you know just how far the east is
[270.92 --> 272.64]  From the west
[272.64 --> 277.86]  I don't have to see the man I've been
[277.86 --> 281.26]  Rising up in me again
[281.26 --> 285.58]  In the arms of your mercy I find red
[285.58 --> 290.62]  But you know just how far the east is
[290.62 --> 291.74]  From the west
[291.74 --> 294.84]  One scarred hand to the other
[294.84 --> 300.54]  Just how far the east is
[300.54 --> 302.04]  From the west
[302.04 --> 305.08]  Just how far
[305.08 --> 308.38]  One scarred hand to the other
[308.38 --> 312.70]  One scarred hand to the other
[312.70 --> 315.20]  Is it for us
[315.20 --> 317.48]  Just how far
[317.48 --> 322.34]  One scarred hand to the other
[322.34 --> 325.20]  One scarred hand to the other
[325.20 --> 326.74]  Let the other
[326.74 --> 326.78]  universal
[326.78 --> 328.56]  Understand why
[328.56 --> 329.02]  One scarred hand to the other
[329.02 --> 330.72]  Benefits does not see the light
[330.72 --> 331.46]  The other
[331.46 --> 332.28]  arrangement in made
[332.28 --> 333.42]  And all these
[333.42 --> 336.10]  dreaming of the 똑같

[363.94 --> 370.12]  You answer me from where the thunder lies
[370.12 --> 375.88]  I cannot run this hard untended to
[375.88 --> 382.02]  With every step I collide with you
[382.02 --> 390.68]  Like a tidal wave, crashing over me
[390.68 --> 394.34]  Rushing into me, me here
[394.34 --> 399.20]  Your love is fierce, like a hurricane
[399.20 --> 402.80]  That I can't escape

[618.02 --> 622.02]  And the riches of His grace

[678.02 --> 681.02]  O Church of Christ, rejoice
[681.02 --> 683.02]  Prayer
[685.02 --> 696.02]  Before them
[696.02 --> 697.00]  When the church Cyril
[697.00 --> 702.60]  name is Chris. I'm one of the pastors here, and it's my privilege this morning, along with these
[702.60 --> 709.96]  others, to lead you in worship together. Before we continue in our worship, there's a couple
[709.96 --> 714.18]  announcements we want to make, and so I'm going to invite Josh to come up to the front so he can be
[714.18 --> 725.74]  ready. First, we are pulling together a children's choir to complement the choir that will be singing
[725.74 --> 734.10]  for us this Christmas in a Christmas program, and so Mark DeGeis, who is directing that choir, is looking
[734.10 --> 741.88]  for kids in this sort of 7 to 14 year old age bracket. We have four who have already signed up
[741.88 --> 749.50]  and are participating. Mark would love to see eight more, and so if you're able or interested, kids, if
[749.50 --> 753.70]  this is something you might be interested in doing, talk to your parents. You can also talk to Mark.
[753.70 --> 760.64]  He is around here somewhere, or will be around here somewhere shortly, and so you can grab him,
[760.76 --> 768.02]  or grab me after, and I will direct you to him. The first practice for that children's choir will be
[768.02 --> 774.02]  on November 6th, immediately after church, and so practices are on Sunday, so you're here already,
[774.02 --> 779.34]  and you can get plugged in in that way. Also, just a couple things I want to draw your attention to
[779.34 --> 786.92]  from the e-bulletin that gets mailed out each week. Night Shift Ministries has begun their dinner
[786.92 --> 797.68]  service, and we, Emanuel Church, are committed to once a month volunteering and populating that and
[797.68 --> 804.48]  making that happen, and so we're looking for groups of five or six people. This is great if you're in a
[804.48 --> 811.72]  care group for the first Wednesday of every second month. Did you track that? If not, it's in the e-bulletin.
[812.52 --> 819.72]  You'll be required from about 645 to about 815. If you're interested, you can connect with myself,
[819.72 --> 826.60]  or Susan Stam is coordinating that, so get connected with her. Also, just wanted to draw your attention to
[826.60 --> 832.54]  the Big Brother, Big Sister Christmas Hamper program that's happening again this year. It's Christmas
[832.54 --> 837.66]  gifts for families in need. You can buy for a small family or for a large family. Again, you can do this
[837.66 --> 842.88]  in your care group or other community group, and for that, you can connect with Mike Prins as he's
[842.88 --> 851.06]  running that. And then finally for me, tonight, just a reminder to the youth, there is 2020 that's
[851.06 --> 856.36]  happening here. It's your first one on spiritual disciplines, and that's going to run from 7 to 830.
[856.62 --> 859.44]  And then Josh has one thing, too. Use that mic there.
[863.34 --> 870.24]  Hello? Okay. Awesome. Thank you, everyone, for volunteering for the care packages for the
[870.24 --> 875.20]  students abroad. We got all the volunteers we needed, so that's an awesome success. Thanks, everybody.
[875.20 --> 881.12]  Also, there is a Bible study in November starting for young adults. If you want to be involved in
[881.12 --> 887.38]  that, get the details, we need to figure out what day we want to do it on. Please come see me over
[887.38 --> 894.00]  the side over there after church. Thank you. Excellent. I think Josh was looking for a round
[894.00 --> 902.12]  of applause there. Does that what it felt like to you? Yeah, all right. We gather together as a church
[902.12 --> 910.36]  family to worship our God, primarily because God calls us to this place, and he carries us into his
[910.36 --> 916.46]  presence. And so if you drove here this morning, if you walked here this morning, the greater spiritual
[916.46 --> 922.02]  truth is that God carried you here this morning. God brought you here this morning, and we mark his
[922.02 --> 929.58]  presence by receiving his greeting. And so receive the greeting of our God as we come to worship him.
[929.58 --> 937.78]  grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son,
[938.16 --> 944.84]  and our Savior, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Let's worship God together.
[947.78 --> 956.42]  Oh, sing to the Lord a new song. Sing to the Lord all the earth. Sing to the Lord, bless his name.
[956.42 --> 965.52]  Tell of his salvation from day to day. Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the
[965.52 --> 974.24]  peoples. For great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised. For he is to be feared above all gods.
[974.24 --> 993.18]  For thou, O Lord, our God above all gods.
[993.18 --> 1023.16]  Thou art exalted, far above all gods. Thou art exalted, far above all gods.
[1023.16 --> 1028.34]  I exalted, far above all gods. I exalted, far above all gods. I exalted, far above all gods. I exalted, far above all gods. sing to the Lord our peł logrin open to day.
[1028.34 --> 1038.16]  I exalted, far above all gods. I exalted, far above all gods. I exalted, far above all gods. I exalted. Not too sad. It is the Lord,
[1042.16 --> 1043.16]  I exalted Om laurens. The Lord of heights. I exalted, far above all gods. I out mercy on God, Lord ofiques on earth.
[1043.16 --> 1061.46]  I exalt Thee, I exalt Thee, I exalt Thee, O Lord.
[1061.46 --> 1071.08]  For Thou, O Lord, art my abide of all the earth.
[1071.08 --> 1080.14]  Thou art exalted, far above all Christ.
[1080.76 --> 1090.40]  For Thou, O Lord, art my abide of all the earth.
[1090.40 --> 1098.84]  Thou art exalted, far above all Christ.
[1098.84 --> 1117.04]  I exalt Thee, I exalt Thee, I exalt Thee, O Lord.
[1117.04 --> 1135.64]  I exalt Thee, I exalt Thee, I exalt Thee, O Lord.
[1135.64 --> 1156.24]  Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city.
[1156.24 --> 1186.24] 
[1186.24 --> 1187.68]  Amen.
[1189.14 --> 1190.62]  Come quickly, Lord Jesus.
[1190.62 --> 1217.62]  To the river I am going, bringing sins I cannot bear.
[1217.62 --> 1222.62]  Come and cleanse me.
[1222.62 --> 1226.62]  Come forgive me.
[1226.62 --> 1232.62]  Lord, I need to meet you there.
[1232.62 --> 1247.02]  In these waters, healing mercy, close with freedom from this land.
[1247.02 --> 1254.02]  I am going to that river.
[1254.02 --> 1255.02]  I am going to that river.
[1255.02 --> 1261.02]  Lord, I need to meet you there.

[1298.02 --> 1303.02]  Come find life beyond comfort.
[1303.02 --> 1310.02]  Come and join us in the river.
[1310.02 --> 1316.02]  Come find life beyond comfort.

[1318.02 --> 1319.02]  Come is joy.
[1319.02 --> 1323.02]  God, come and join us in the river.

[1472.16 --> 1474.44]  He says
[1474.44 --> 1478.16]  For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat
[1478.76 --> 1482.68]  I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink
[1482.68 --> 1486.88]  I was a stranger and you invited me in
[1486.88 --> 1490.24]  I needed clothes and you clothed me
[1490.24 --> 1494.84]  I was in prison and you came to visit me

[1696.66 --> 1702.66]  Lord of all.
[1702.66 --> 1708.66]  All our hope is in you.
[1708.66 --> 1714.66]  All our hope is in you.
[1714.66 --> 1722.66]  All the glory to you, God.
[1722.66 --> 1728.66]  The light of the world.
[1728.66 --> 1734.66]  Jesus, Messiah.
[1734.66 --> 1740.66]  Name above all names.
[1740.66 --> 1750.66]  Blessed Redeemer, Emmanuel.
[1750.66 --> 1756.66]  The rescue for sinners.
[1756.66 --> 1760.66]  The ransom from heaven.
[1760.66 --> 1766.66]  Jesus, Messiah.
[1766.66 --> 1768.66]  Lord of all.
[1768.66 --> 1770.66]  Lord of all.
[1770.66 --> 1772.66]  Jesus, Messiah.
[1772.66 --> 1774.66]  Lord of all.
[1774.66 --> 1776.66]  Jesus, Messiah.
[1776.66 --> 1778.66]  Lord of all.
[1778.66 --> 1780.66]  I invite you to be seated.
[1780.66 --> 1796.66]  And, oh, I'm as loud as Kevin now.
[1796.66 --> 1808.66]  Kids, age three, up to grade four, anyone who feels like they would like to come up, you're welcome to come join me at the front here for Kids Corner.
[1808.66 --> 1822.66]  So we're going to start Kids Corner today by talking about our memory verses.
[1822.66 --> 1826.66]  And I just realized that I need to say kind of a big thank you to you guys.
[1826.66 --> 1832.66]  If you remember back last year, we had a lot of church maybe at your house where you're watching it on TV.
[1832.66 --> 1840.66]  And some of us, me and Mr. Eric and Mr. Mike and Pastor Kevin, were doing Kids Corner and we were doing all these different memory verses.
[1840.66 --> 1843.66]  And it was really hard for us to do the actions and remember them.
[1843.66 --> 1844.66]  So we needed your help.
[1844.66 --> 1848.66]  And lots of you guys made videos of the memory verses.
[1848.66 --> 1850.66]  And you might have seen each other during church.
[1850.66 --> 1858.66]  So I just wanted to thank you guys for doing that, for participating and helping us all, the whole church, learn those verses together.
[1858.66 --> 1862.66]  And then I just wanted to remind you that we actually still have memory verses.
[1862.66 --> 1870.66]  Our new coordinators here have picked one from the book of 1 Peter for this month because in the church here, we've been doing a sermon series on that.
[1870.66 --> 1873.66]  So your moms and dads have been learning about 1 Peter.
[1873.66 --> 1877.66]  So we're going to just practice the memory verse today all together.
[1877.66 --> 1878.66]  Everybody here.
[1878.66 --> 1880.66]  We're going to just repeat it.
[1880.66 --> 1883.66]  I don't have any actions, but we'll repeat it.
[1883.66 --> 1887.66]  I'll say it and then you guys can repeat it and we'll do that a couple times so it gets in our head.
[1887.66 --> 1890.66]  And then hopefully you'll remember it for the week to come.
[1890.66 --> 1891.66]  So it goes like this.
[1891.66 --> 1896.66]  So I'll say the first couple words and then when I pause, you guys repeat it.
[1896.66 --> 1897.66]  Can you guys do that?
[1897.66 --> 1899.66]  Can you guys do that?
[1899.66 --> 1901.66]  Okay, we'll see.
[1901.66 --> 1902.66]  The kids seem confident.
[1902.66 --> 1904.66]  Everyone else, I'm not quite sure.
[1904.66 --> 1922.66]  So above all, love each other deeply because love covers over a multitude of sins.
[1922.66 --> 1927.66]  1 Peter 4 verse 8.
[1927.66 --> 1928.66]  All right.
[1928.66 --> 1930.66]  I think we need to practice it one more time.
[1930.66 --> 1933.66]  I'm going to say a few more words at a time this time.
[1933.66 --> 1934.66]  I think you can do it.
[1934.66 --> 1946.66]  Above all, love each other deeply because love covers over a multitude of sins.
[1946.66 --> 1951.66]  1 Peter 4 verse 8.
[1951.66 --> 1952.66]  Nice work.
[1952.66 --> 1953.66]  All right.
[1953.66 --> 1961.66]  So just a reminder for everybody that there are some of these cards in the foyer at the children's worship time booth.
[1961.66 --> 1967.66]  If that helps your family to remember this on your fridge or somewhere in your house, you can grab one.
[1967.66 --> 1972.66]  And kids, if you remember it next week at church, one of the coordinators will be coming around.
[1972.66 --> 1975.66]  And I think there are some prizes if you remember this.
[1975.66 --> 1979.66]  I have one more question actually about this.
[1979.66 --> 1982.66]  It's about one of the words, the word multitude.
[1982.66 --> 1985.66]  Do you guys here up front know what a multitude is?
[1985.66 --> 1987.66]  How many people know what a multitude is?
[1987.66 --> 1989.66]  Put up your hand if you know what that means.
[1990.66 --> 1992.66]  Nora, what does it mean?
[1992.66 --> 1994.66]  A big group, a whole bunch.
[1994.66 --> 1999.66]  So a multitude of sins is a little bit of sin or a lot of sin?
[1999.66 --> 2000.66]  A lot.
[2000.66 --> 2002.66]  So what does this verse mean?
[2002.66 --> 2009.66]  It means that when we love each other, when we love each other and our families and our friends and our church and our community,
[2009.66 --> 2013.66]  that we will be forgiving of people who do sins.
[2013.66 --> 2015.66]  And how many of us sin?
[2016.66 --> 2017.66]  All.
[2017.66 --> 2018.66]  Exactly.
[2018.66 --> 2019.66]  All of us.
[2019.66 --> 2022.66]  So it's important to love each other and not just a little bit, deeply it says.
[2022.66 --> 2028.66]  So in our children's worship time today, we're going to talk about a multitude as well, but not about a multitude of sins.
[2028.66 --> 2035.66]  It's about a man who had a promise that he would have a multitude of descendants or family members.
[2035.66 --> 2037.66]  Does anyone know who that guy is?
[2037.66 --> 2038.66]  Haley, who do you think?
[2038.66 --> 2039.66]  Noah.
[2040.66 --> 2042.66]  Does anyone have any other guesses?
[2042.66 --> 2043.66]  Zoe, what do you think?
[2044.66 --> 2045.66]  Jesus?
[2045.66 --> 2047.66]  All people in the Bible.
[2047.66 --> 2050.66]  It starts with the letter A.
[2051.66 --> 2052.66]  Malachi?
[2052.66 --> 2053.66]  Abraham.
[2053.66 --> 2054.66]  Abraham.
[2054.66 --> 2055.66]  Thanks.
[2055.66 --> 2057.66]  The winters, you got it.
[2057.66 --> 2065.66]  We're going to learn about Abraham and God had a promise for him that he would have so many family members, descendants, as many as the stars in the sky.
[2065.66 --> 2069.66]  So we'll pray together and then we'll stand up after for the blessing.
[2070.66 --> 2076.66]  Lord Jesus, we thank you for your word and that we can remember it and that we can learn from it.
[2076.66 --> 2084.66]  And we pray that you would give us the strength to love each other deeply and to be forgiving in hard times and in easy times, God.
[2084.66 --> 2089.66]  Thank you for this chance to gather together and learn more about you.
[2090.66 --> 2091.66]  In Jesus name, amen.
[2092.66 --> 2093.66]  Alright, let's all stand up.
[2095.66 --> 2098.66]  And, yep, kids, we're going to face everyone else.
[2114.66 --> 2127.66]  As the children leave the sanctuary here, I've got a couple announcements.
[2127.66 --> 2130.66]  I'm not here doing the prayer, but I've got a couple announcements.
[2131.66 --> 2139.66]  If most of you have not known or read in the bulletin, I have been selected by my peers to be chair of council.
[2139.66 --> 2143.66]  So you'll see me up here. We're doing some announcements throughout the year.
[2144.66 --> 2148.66]  And with that, I have some announcements today for you all.
[2149.66 --> 2156.66]  So first thing I'd like to address is we had to do a little bit of a shift with our admin council this term.
[2157.66 --> 2158.66]  We thought we'd let you guys know.
[2159.66 --> 2164.66]  Pim shown that this time in his life is not a good time to take on the responsibilities that came with being the clerk.
[2164.66 --> 2173.66]  So we've decided to just take care of that internally with some other people in council stepped up to fill in some of the responsibilities that come with that.
[2174.66 --> 2176.66]  So that's what we're going to do.
[2177.66 --> 2180.66]  And we should be, that should all work out fine.
[2180.66 --> 2188.66]  So the next thing that comes along with that is that we're going to have a congregational meeting coming up in the end of November.
[2188.66 --> 2189.66]  So we'd like you everyone to come there.
[2190.66 --> 2195.66]  This is a good opportunity for everybody to have a say and an input in how this church is where we're going and where we're heading.
[2196.66 --> 2199.66]  So we appreciate and would like to have everybody come out for that.
[2199.66 --> 2208.66]  And in the next couple of weeks you should be getting some correspondence in your mailbox about the budget and all those kind of things have to get passed at the next meeting.
[2209.66 --> 2210.66]  So thank you.
[2210.66 --> 2225.66]  Good morning.
[2226.66 --> 2235.66]  I am Ken and I am an elder here at Emmanuel and I am going to lead you in congregational prayer this morning.
[2235.66 --> 2239.66]  Let's pray.
[2240.66 --> 2257.66]  Our Father who is in heaven, what a comfort to know that you are our Father, that you are present in our lives every day, that we may come to you week after week in prayer and in praise of your holy name.
[2257.66 --> 2266.66]  Father, your amazing design on this world is once again right in front of us as we see the leaves changing and making beautiful colors showing your greatness.
[2267.66 --> 2277.66]  It is also a sure knowledge that in five or six months or so the leaves will once again begin to grow as you have designed it that way and showing your renewing power.
[2277.66 --> 2288.66]  Lord, as we come to you this morning, we come to you because it is good to stop, to stop dealing with what we sometimes think is important.
[2289.66 --> 2295.66]  We keep our lives so busy with work, family, friends, hobbies and many self-serving things.
[2295.66 --> 2302.66]  We need to come here to slow down, stop and acknowledge you as the sovereign Lord and provider of all things.
[2303.66 --> 2308.66]  We need to acknowledge that we do not keep our lives busy with your good work as much as we should.
[2309.66 --> 2316.66]  And Lord, forgive us for our sins and help us to focus our lives on you and love for others instead of love for ourselves.
[2316.66 --> 2324.66]  Father, we pray for Steve, Karen and their children as they continue to grieve the passing of Karen's dad.
[2325.66 --> 2329.66]  Father, we pray that you will give them peace and assurance during this time.
[2330.66 --> 2338.66]  We continue to hold up to you Willie, Bob, Juanita and Janet as they continue to struggle with various health issues.
[2339.66 --> 2344.66]  Father, be near to each one and grant that they may recover to full health.
[2344.66 --> 2353.66]  We pray for all those at Manoa Manor as many are suffering from COVID there and a number of residents have passed away recently.
[2354.66 --> 2358.66]  We pray for comfort for those families and ask for an end to this outbreak.
[2359.66 --> 2363.66]  Father, we pray for all those suffering from COVID at this time.
[2364.66 --> 2369.66]  Even though in some ways things are getting better, COVID is still here and it is still affecting so many people.
[2369.66 --> 2380.66]  Be with our healthcare system, the workers as they deal with overloaded ICUs and hospitals, as well as the trauma involved in seeing so many suffering people.
[2381.66 --> 2394.66]  Father, as the amount of information out there continues to grow and people try to decipher what is truth and what is not, give wisdom, give patience and give us servant hearts to deal with each other in love.
[2394.66 --> 2397.66]  Watch over those who are shut in and unable to get around.
[2398.66 --> 2402.66]  Father, this has also caused an increase in mental health issues.
[2403.66 --> 2411.66]  And Father, the suffering of mental health is one that can take the strongest of people and bring them to their knees in anguish.
[2411.66 --> 2416.66]  Father, be their light, their comfort and their strength.
[2417.66 --> 2420.66]  We also pray for our pastor and his family.
[2421.66 --> 2428.66]  They have been displaced from their home and are again moving into another temporary place while repairs to their house will hopefully get underway soon.
[2429.66 --> 2436.66]  Give them patience, peace and wisdom as they deal with all of this along with maintaining their regular day-to-day responsibilities.
[2436.66 --> 2441.66]  Continue to watch over the good work of your church here in this place.
[2442.66 --> 2445.66]  There are many groups, committees, care groups, leadership groups.
[2446.66 --> 2453.66]  All of these are designed to offer opportunity for your people to serve you and honor you by loving your church and the people in it.
[2454.66 --> 2457.66]  It can also provide ways to reach the people in our community.
[2457.66 --> 2466.66]  And Lord, may we be a light to all people here in Murrayville to point people to you, to a life of joy in you.
[2467.66 --> 2471.66]  Grant us all a heart of learning and hearing as your servant Chris brings us your word.
[2472.66 --> 2474.66]  May we all rest in you in this day.
[2474.66 --> 2475.66]  In Jesus name we pray.
[2475.66 --> 2476.66]  Amen.
[2487.66 --> 2510.66]  We're going to continue in our series in the book of 1 Peter this morning.
[2510.66 --> 2515.66]  And in just a moment I'm going to read with you from 1 Peter 2.
[2516.66 --> 2517.66]  We're going to start at verse 11.
[2517.66 --> 2525.66]  So if you'd like you can grab a Bible or turn your phone Bible app on and get that ready to go.
[2525.66 --> 2527.66]  We will read that together shortly.
[2527.66 --> 2530.66]  It will also be on the screen behind me.
[2531.66 --> 2534.66]  For what it's worth, this is a bit of an aside.
[2534.66 --> 2547.66]  I really do think it's best, I think the best way to engage in the preaching and that opportunity is to have a Bible.
[2547.66 --> 2549.66]  Whether it's on your phone or in your hands.
[2549.66 --> 2552.66]  Because we will refer back and go around and jump around.
[2552.66 --> 2559.66]  And it seems to me that there's just something helpful about having that concretely in your hands.
[2559.66 --> 2565.66]  And so maybe even the best way to do that is to bring your own personal Bible from home.
[2565.66 --> 2567.66]  Your devotional Bible.
[2567.66 --> 2572.66]  And then you can write all over it and highlight all over it and color code it and make it look all beautiful and the like.
[2572.66 --> 2577.66]  And then when I get boring, because inevitably that will happen, you have a place where you can draw a picture.
[2577.66 --> 2583.66]  And continue at least looking like you're participating in that way.
[2583.66 --> 2586.66]  Forgive me for that.
[2586.66 --> 2597.66]  Some of you know, but when I was a kid, I grew up in a great Christian home with really loving parents.
[2597.66 --> 2599.66]  And I say that not just because my parents are here.
[2599.66 --> 2601.66]  Hi, Mom and Dad.
[2601.66 --> 2604.66]  I say that because it's true.
[2604.66 --> 2610.66]  We were part of a church that, and some of you understand this, right?
[2610.66 --> 2611.66]  You get this.
[2611.66 --> 2613.66]  That had two services.
[2613.66 --> 2628.66]  And we went every week to morning church and afternoon church at 4 o'clock in the winters and then 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock or whatever o'clock in the summertime.
[2628.66 --> 2632.66]  Because part of our church was in a farming community, and so you know what it is.
[2632.66 --> 2637.66]  You adjust for milking schedules and make hay when the sun shines and all of that.
[2637.66 --> 2643.66]  Anyway, I grew up in a pretty traditional and conservative church community.
[2643.66 --> 2650.66]  What that meant was we went to church twice on Sunday and nothing got in the way of that.
[2650.66 --> 2657.66]  I didn't understand what that meant as a kid until I brushed up to a conflict.
[2657.66 --> 2660.66]  And so, when I was younger, I played baseball.
[2660.66 --> 2665.66]  And I played a lot of baseball, and I really enjoyed it, and it was fun.
[2665.66 --> 2676.66]  And one year, I was 12 or 13 or something, and I managed to make the city travel team for baseball.
[2676.66 --> 2679.66]  And I was super excited.
[2679.66 --> 2686.66]  Not the least of which because when I went to the tryouts, the final tryout, I rode my bike there, and I was running late, so I was going too fast.
[2686.66 --> 2691.66]  And I crashed my bike, and I skidded across the ground, and I had road rash on my hands and knees.
[2691.66 --> 2694.66]  But still, I showed up and I made that team.
[2694.66 --> 2697.66]  I was proud of my effort and the ability.
[2697.66 --> 2705.66]  And so, a couple days later, the coach calls, and he says, Chris, I want you to know you've made the team.
[2705.66 --> 2706.66]  We want you to join us.
[2706.66 --> 2709.66]  Our first practice is Sunday morning.
[2709.66 --> 2714.66]  I said, Coach, you're going to have to wait a second.
[2714.66 --> 2716.66]  Mom?
[2716.66 --> 2719.66]  Can we talk?
[2719.66 --> 2727.66]  Well, it turns out I couldn't play on that team because we had to prioritize going to church.
[2727.66 --> 2732.66]  Now, as a 12 or 13-year-old, I didn't get that at all.
[2732.66 --> 2738.66]  And I know that there are some of you here this morning who make different decisions than that for your family.
[2738.66 --> 2741.66]  In our family, that was the decision that was made.
[2741.66 --> 2747.66]  Now, I would note that after I was a teenager and moved out of the house, my parents stopped going to the second service.
[2747.66 --> 2751.66]  So, interesting.
[2754.66 --> 2758.66]  I had to talk to the coach and tell him that I couldn't play.
[2758.66 --> 2763.66]  And that we went to church on Sunday mornings.
[2763.66 --> 2776.66]  And whether or not this was actually the case or if this was just what I heard because I was receiving and processing this information through my own lens of lack of understanding,
[2776.66 --> 2783.66]  but I heard in my coach's voice disappointment because he didn't get it.
[2783.66 --> 2784.66]  What do you mean you have church?
[2784.66 --> 2786.66]  You can go next week.
[2786.66 --> 2788.66]  Or in my family, you could go in the afternoon.
[2788.66 --> 2790.66]  You could still come in the morning.
[2794.66 --> 2804.66]  It was, for me, but for people on the outside looking in, weird that we made those kinds of decisions as Christians.
[2808.66 --> 2813.66]  Now, we don't need to have a big conversation about Sabbatarianism and legalism and things like that.
[2813.66 --> 2825.66]  But what I want you to hear as we come into this text from 1 Peter is what does it mean to be weird as Christians to the world around us?
[2825.66 --> 2840.66]  What does it mean for the types of things that we do, the sorts of decisions we make, the things that we participate in to look strange and foreign and alien, people who just can't get it?
[2840.66 --> 2843.66]  With that in mind, let's look at this text.
[2843.66 --> 2849.66]  1 Peter 2, starting at verse 11.
[2849.66 --> 2863.66]  Dear friends, I urge you as foreigners and exiles to abstain from sinful desires which wage war against your soul.
[2863.66 --> 2875.66]  Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.
[2875.66 --> 2891.66]  Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human authority, whether to the emperor as the supreme authority, or to governors who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right.
[2891.66 --> 2898.66]  For it is God's will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people.
[2898.66 --> 2902.66]  Live as free people.
[2902.66 --> 2906.66]  But do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil.
[2906.66 --> 2910.66]  Live as God's slaves.
[2910.66 --> 2913.66]  Show proper respect to everyone.
[2913.66 --> 2915.66]  Love the family of believers.
[2915.66 --> 2916.66]  Fear God.
[2916.66 --> 2918.66]  Honor the emperor.
[2918.66 --> 2919.66]  The emperor.
[2919.66 --> 2921.66]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2921.66 --> 2947.66]  Now, for those of you who have been following along in this series, either here in person or online, you will recall that we have available for you and for your personal study or your care group study, a bit of a Bible study that doesn't necessarily parallel this work because you can move through it at different paces, but allows you to dig deep into the processing of this work.
[2947.66 --> 2954.66]  And so, if you haven't heard about that, or if you would like a copy of this, you can talk to me after and we'll get that situated.
[2954.66 --> 2964.66]  Now, Peter starts this section of his letter by saying, dear friends.
[2964.66 --> 2989.66]  And now, while it is likely true that the recipients of this letter are dear friends of Peter or that he considers them as such, what I want you to hear first and foremost is that the word that's used there, this letter was originally written in Greek, and the Greek word that is used there is agapetoi, which means literally beloved.
[2989.66 --> 2990.66]  Beloved.
[2991.56 --> 2992.20]  Beloved.
[2992.62 --> 2999.58]  And so, this is more than Friends of Peter, this is ultimately about being beloved.
[3000.26 --> 3001.76]  But beloved by whom?
[3003.58 --> 3008.20]  Because ultimately, this is about being beloved or loved of God.
[3009.18 --> 3015.42]  And Peter has been spending time reminding us that we are chosen by God and precious to Him.
[3015.42 --> 3020.50]  Pastor Kevin looked at this last week for us, that we are his special possession.
[3021.64 --> 3024.28]  This is the ground of our identity.
[3024.86 --> 3032.62]  This is the firm foundation of which Jesus is the cornerstone for your life and for yourself.
[3033.46 --> 3039.66]  As a chosen people, by grace through faith, you are loved of God.
[3039.66 --> 3049.22]  Or, to put it another way, you are loved of God, and so, by grace through faith, he has chosen you.
[3050.10 --> 3056.18]  He has made you for his own, adopted you as heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ.
[3056.34 --> 3064.04]  You are lavishly loved of the Father, and he has called you a son or a daughter.
[3064.04 --> 3068.72]  And you have received this from him.
[3069.66 --> 3078.14]  And because you are beloved of him, you also become more in him.
[3079.96 --> 3087.10]  Peter writes, beloved, I urge you as foreigners and exiles.
[3088.10 --> 3090.98]  This is all identity language, right?
[3091.12 --> 3094.68]  Beloved, foreigners, and exiles.
[3094.68 --> 3107.02]  Now, the older translation of the NIV that maybe you have or that you read from, the older one than the one we are currently using anyway, there says strangers and aliens.
[3108.10 --> 3110.06]  Now, you might read the ESV.
[3110.20 --> 3111.64]  That's another translation that I like.
[3111.70 --> 3114.16]  It says sojourners and exiles.
[3114.16 --> 3123.10]  Or maybe you're old enough or of a particular generation to remember the King James Version that says strangers and pilgrims.
[3124.02 --> 3124.88]  But here's the point, right?
[3124.96 --> 3132.20]  Being loved of God, beloved of God, being his beloved puts you in a relationship with God.
[3132.20 --> 3142.04]  And being in a relationship with God changes your relationship to the world and changes your relationships in the world.
[3143.08 --> 3148.58]  No longer do you feel at home here, completely comfortable and settled.
[3148.58 --> 3153.22]  Instead, Peter says, you are a foreigner.
[3153.62 --> 3154.90]  You are an exile.
[3155.70 --> 3162.50]  Because you are loved of God, you love what he loves and you love the way that he loves.
[3163.82 --> 3169.86]  And when you do that, that will make you a stranger and an alien in the world.
[3169.86 --> 3182.02]  Because you are loved by God, because you love what he loves and you love the way that he loves, you will be strangers and aliens, foreigners and exiles in a world that doesn't know him.
[3185.00 --> 3194.94]  I want to be bold with you this morning because the time is coming and has now come when you too will have to be bold about it.
[3194.94 --> 3209.30]  Because if your life isn't foreign, if your life isn't strangely incomprehensible or uniquely different, if you don't seem to be at least a little bit weird to those people in your life or work or school or neighborhood,
[3209.82 --> 3214.16]  what are you really basing your life on?
[3215.26 --> 3219.34]  Who or what are you really being defined by?
[3219.34 --> 3229.70]  If you look and act and sound exactly the same and have the same hopes and dreams for your life, are you really any different?
[3230.62 --> 3234.32]  And if you're not different, what's the point?
[3237.04 --> 3242.26]  Like I said, a time is coming, and maybe it's already come, when we will have to decide.
[3242.26 --> 3254.16]  In a post-Christian culture, in a time of secular paganism, meaningful, committed, gospel-centered, Jesus-exalting, God-glorifying Christianity,
[3254.36 --> 3257.08]  we'll not be able to hide in the mainstream.
[3258.42 --> 3266.66]  Instead, we're going to have to stand against the flow of culture and the tides of idolatry, whatever form it's going to take in today's world.
[3266.66 --> 3277.54]  The reality of living as exiles in the world is this new reality for us.
[3278.26 --> 3280.90]  And that's what Peter is urging us in.
[3280.98 --> 3281.16]  He says,
[3281.28 --> 3290.88]  I urge you, beloved, as foreigners and exiles, to abstain from sinful desires which wage war against your soul.
[3291.84 --> 3293.22]  And so hear that, right?
[3293.26 --> 3294.48]  There's more identity language.
[3294.48 --> 3301.42]  Beloved, foreigner, exile, and now warriors.
[3302.90 --> 3304.26]  You are at war.
[3305.08 --> 3307.00]  And it's a war for your soul.
[3307.12 --> 3308.74]  It's a war against sin.
[3309.86 --> 3312.90]  I want to acknowledge here that this probably isn't politically correct.
[3313.84 --> 3317.02]  And this maybe offends your modern sensibility,
[3317.36 --> 3322.28]  and this definitely contradicts the social value of tolerance that is so common in our world today.
[3322.28 --> 3324.14]  But you are at war.
[3324.28 --> 3327.32]  To be a Christian is to be at war.
[3327.54 --> 3330.16]  But, and I'm going to slow down,
[3330.94 --> 3332.98]  and I'm going to lean in, and I'm going to ask you to lean in,
[3333.20 --> 3334.56]  because I want you to listen carefully.
[3335.36 --> 3338.38]  You are at war, but, and here it is,
[3338.90 --> 3343.22]  first and foremost, you are not at war against a political ideology.
[3343.22 --> 3348.50]  You are not at war against a cultural morality or against a cultural immorality.
[3348.70 --> 3352.54]  You are not at war, first and foremost, against flesh and blood.
[3352.88 --> 3356.42]  You are at war with your sinful desires.
[3357.28 --> 3357.38]  Right?
[3357.44 --> 3361.16]  Your war is first here, and it is second here.
[3361.38 --> 3365.46]  And really, only after you lose this war and this war in your heart and in your head,
[3365.46 --> 3367.32]  and you act on those sinful desires,
[3367.44 --> 3370.62]  does your war move out of here and into the world?
[3373.20 --> 3377.48]  The problem is that so many of us, so many of you,
[3379.08 --> 3385.46]  especially if you lived and came to formation in the 20th century,
[3386.26 --> 3390.84]  did so in a time when we could talk about a Christian culture.
[3390.84 --> 3391.62]  Right?
[3391.68 --> 3396.16]  When the only real religious divide was whether you were Protestant or Catholic.
[3398.06 --> 3400.00]  Now, sure, by the end of the 20th century,
[3400.14 --> 3404.14]  atheism has sort of emerged into the upper echelons of society,
[3404.26 --> 3406.58]  but the average person, if not a Christian,
[3406.82 --> 3409.84]  was still likely a theist or a deist,
[3409.92 --> 3411.66]  or at most, they were an agnostic.
[3413.54 --> 3416.62]  And because that was the dominant sort of cultural milieu,
[3416.86 --> 3420.28]  the dominant cultural context in which so many of us came up,
[3420.28 --> 3424.44]  and so many of us lived for so long, for generations, for centuries, really,
[3424.98 --> 3427.10]  we could presume belief.
[3427.40 --> 3432.20]  Or at minimum, as Christians, we could presume a sympathy for belief.
[3433.30 --> 3437.24]  And it's out of that context that rises things like the culture wars.
[3438.20 --> 3438.36]  Right?
[3438.42 --> 3442.56]  That rises things like the sexual revolution of the 60s and into the present,
[3442.66 --> 3445.40]  and the purity movement that happens in response.
[3445.68 --> 3446.56]  And let's be honest, right?
[3446.56 --> 3449.42]  When that wasn't enough of a war going on around us,
[3449.44 --> 3451.86]  in the evangelical church, we created our own wars.
[3451.94 --> 3453.06]  We had worship wars.
[3454.02 --> 3455.30]  Of all the things to fight about.
[3456.76 --> 3461.50]  But this is what happens when you take the war against your own sinful desires
[3461.50 --> 3463.32]  out of your heart and out of your head
[3463.32 --> 3466.26]  and project it onto a culture around you,
[3466.84 --> 3469.88]  especially onto the unbelieving parts of that culture.
[3469.88 --> 3474.32]  But our context has changed.
[3476.32 --> 3479.06]  So many of us operate as if it hasn't.
[3480.94 --> 3482.46]  Maybe we lost the culture wars.
[3483.78 --> 3487.20]  Maybe the sexual revolution won in a war of attrition.
[3488.56 --> 3492.38]  But in our post-Christian, 21st century, progressive and liberal world,
[3492.64 --> 3494.30]  the war isn't out there.
[3494.64 --> 3495.48]  It's in here.
[3496.46 --> 3497.38]  And it's in here.
[3497.38 --> 3504.78]  When was the last time that you fought against the sin in your life
[3504.78 --> 3506.02]  like you were at war?
[3508.80 --> 3512.70]  Instead, we sing Simon and Garfunkel,
[3513.16 --> 3514.80]  Hello, darkness, my old friend.
[3515.80 --> 3518.00]  We make friends with our sin.
[3518.46 --> 3520.16]  Now, that reference might be too old for some of you,
[3520.24 --> 3521.38]  so here's another one.
[3521.42 --> 3522.80]  Avi Kaplan, right?
[3522.90 --> 3524.54]  I know darkness and it knows me.
[3524.66 --> 3526.32]  I know my sins and they know me.
[3526.32 --> 3527.32]  Right?
[3529.08 --> 3534.08]  We so easily become complacent in and with our sins.
[3534.24 --> 3536.78]  Or, if not complacent, we become cynical,
[3537.02 --> 3539.36]  believing that there's no way that we can overcome them
[3539.36 --> 3541.00]  or there's no way that they can be overcome
[3541.00 --> 3543.62]  in Jesus or in the power of the Spirit.
[3545.06 --> 3547.24]  Or we could become indifferent,
[3548.24 --> 3550.52]  believing that they're not really that bad,
[3551.02 --> 3553.92]  that it's just okay, it's who I am,
[3553.92 --> 3556.16]  and really, what's wrong with me being who I am?
[3560.80 --> 3561.94]  This is a war
[3561.94 --> 3564.84]  for your identity
[3564.84 --> 3566.76]  and your soul.
[3568.04 --> 3569.58]  And into that context,
[3569.74 --> 3570.40]  Peter says,
[3570.40 --> 3570.96]  instead,
[3571.96 --> 3574.16]  live such good lives
[3574.16 --> 3575.28]  among the pagans
[3575.28 --> 3577.66]  that though they accuse you of doing wrong,
[3578.24 --> 3579.74]  they may see your good deeds
[3579.74 --> 3582.08]  and glorify God on the day he visits.
[3583.08 --> 3584.86]  Live such good lives,
[3585.56 --> 3586.04]  Peter says.
[3586.58 --> 3586.72]  Right?
[3586.78 --> 3587.10]  Peter says,
[3587.20 --> 3588.10]  resist evil
[3588.10 --> 3589.10]  and do good.
[3589.10 --> 3590.76]  Stop doing those things
[3590.76 --> 3592.74]  that define you apart or before Jesus
[3592.74 --> 3595.18]  and start doing or doing more of
[3595.18 --> 3597.30]  the sorts of things that define you
[3597.30 --> 3598.46]  in Jesus.
[3599.04 --> 3599.14]  Right?
[3599.18 --> 3602.26]  They're two sides of the same identity coin,
[3602.38 --> 3603.84]  two sides of being beloved
[3603.84 --> 3605.78]  and foreigners and exiles.
[3606.56 --> 3607.54]  This is what it means
[3607.54 --> 3609.80]  to be born again into a living hope,
[3609.80 --> 3611.42]  and this is how being born again
[3611.42 --> 3612.26]  into a living hope
[3612.26 --> 3613.74]  changes you.
[3615.32 --> 3616.80]  Live such good lives
[3617.52 --> 3619.24]  among the pagans.
[3620.12 --> 3620.92]  Now, really quick,
[3621.02 --> 3621.44]  two things.
[3622.22 --> 3622.70]  Here, first,
[3623.32 --> 3624.42]  pagans is,
[3624.58 --> 3625.06]  again,
[3625.14 --> 3626.06]  it's another Greek word
[3626.06 --> 3627.72]  and it's the Greek word ethnos.
[3627.92 --> 3630.12]  It's from which we get the word ethnicity.
[3631.50 --> 3631.66]  Right?
[3631.70 --> 3632.26]  And it means,
[3632.34 --> 3632.78]  simply,
[3632.98 --> 3635.22]  nations or people of the world.
[3635.72 --> 3636.44]  Now, in the Bible,
[3636.66 --> 3637.34]  when it's used,
[3637.62 --> 3639.66]  it refers to nations or people
[3639.66 --> 3641.14]  who don't believe
[3641.14 --> 3643.72]  in the Judeo-Christian God.
[3644.78 --> 3645.38]  And so here,
[3645.52 --> 3646.30]  in this use,
[3646.70 --> 3648.26]  pagans doesn't have that same
[3648.26 --> 3650.26]  sort of like naturalist,
[3650.48 --> 3652.02]  religious connotations
[3652.02 --> 3653.06]  that it might have
[3653.06 --> 3654.74]  for some of us here this morning.
[3655.30 --> 3656.14]  But notice,
[3657.34 --> 3660.50]  it is still a religious term.
[3660.86 --> 3660.98]  Right?
[3661.00 --> 3662.46]  It is about who you believe in
[3662.46 --> 3663.82]  or don't believe in.
[3664.06 --> 3666.62]  The context is life lived,
[3666.78 --> 3668.68]  engaging in and with a society
[3668.68 --> 3670.16]  of all sorts of people,
[3670.36 --> 3671.72]  of all sorts of worldviews,
[3671.76 --> 3673.08]  a society of all sorts of
[3673.08 --> 3674.54]  religious ideas
[3674.54 --> 3675.62]  and identities,
[3676.08 --> 3676.80]  a society
[3676.80 --> 3679.60]  very much like ours.
[3681.46 --> 3682.30]  And then second,
[3682.50 --> 3683.04]  notice this.
[3684.54 --> 3685.00]  Peter says,
[3685.12 --> 3687.32]  to live such good lives
[3687.32 --> 3688.92]  among
[3688.92 --> 3690.78]  the pagans.
[3690.78 --> 3695.44]  the proper Christian expectation
[3695.44 --> 3697.38]  is that you will be
[3697.38 --> 3698.88]  in the world.
[3699.70 --> 3701.38]  We live in the midst
[3701.38 --> 3702.22]  of it all.
[3702.36 --> 3702.40]  Right?
[3702.40 --> 3703.08]  We don't run.
[3703.22 --> 3703.90]  We don't hide.
[3704.18 --> 3705.04]  We don't pull away.
[3705.14 --> 3706.16]  We don't get all sectarian.
[3706.40 --> 3707.60]  We aren't living in secluded
[3707.60 --> 3708.88]  coisters behind walls
[3708.88 --> 3709.44]  of division
[3709.44 --> 3710.70]  and hostility.
[3711.56 --> 3712.00]  Instead,
[3713.00 --> 3714.82]  the model that the Bible
[3714.82 --> 3715.50]  gets us,
[3715.66 --> 3716.38]  the model that Peter
[3716.38 --> 3717.82]  picks up for us
[3717.82 --> 3718.60]  is the same
[3718.60 --> 3720.48]  as what Jeremiah
[3720.48 --> 3721.58]  writes
[3721.58 --> 3723.36]  all those years before
[3723.36 --> 3724.42]  to the exiles
[3724.42 --> 3725.44]  in Babylon.
[3727.10 --> 3728.14]  If you've been around
[3728.14 --> 3729.04]  since we started
[3729.04 --> 3730.32]  this series a few weeks ago,
[3730.54 --> 3731.46]  you will recall
[3731.46 --> 3732.66]  that we reminded you
[3732.66 --> 3734.72]  of that exile
[3734.72 --> 3736.02]  and the stories
[3736.02 --> 3736.64]  of Daniel,
[3736.88 --> 3737.54]  of Shadrach,
[3737.64 --> 3738.14]  of Meshach,
[3738.22 --> 3738.66]  and Abednego,
[3738.82 --> 3739.74]  the story of Esther.
[3740.70 --> 3740.84]  Right?
[3740.92 --> 3741.56]  They are all
[3741.56 --> 3743.06]  among the youngest
[3743.06 --> 3743.66]  Israelites
[3743.66 --> 3744.88]  who were carried off
[3744.88 --> 3745.84]  and then in many places
[3745.84 --> 3746.82]  brought into service
[3746.82 --> 3747.36]  in the courts
[3747.36 --> 3747.84]  of the king.
[3748.68 --> 3748.82]  Now,
[3748.82 --> 3750.02]  Jeremiah is a prophet
[3750.02 --> 3751.34]  who is back in Jerusalem.
[3751.84 --> 3753.34]  He warned of the coming exile
[3753.34 --> 3754.58]  and he explained
[3754.58 --> 3755.62]  why it was happening,
[3755.80 --> 3756.30]  but also,
[3756.44 --> 3757.04]  what Jeremiah did
[3757.04 --> 3758.42]  was he wrote a letter
[3758.42 --> 3759.72]  to the exiles
[3759.72 --> 3761.18]  in Babylon.
[3762.32 --> 3763.18]  We have that recorded
[3763.18 --> 3764.58]  for us in Jeremiah 29.
[3765.06 --> 3766.26]  This is God's word
[3766.26 --> 3767.52]  to those who live
[3767.52 --> 3768.66]  in the sort of circumstances
[3768.66 --> 3770.24]  that Peter is talking about
[3770.24 --> 3771.74]  that we live in.
[3772.60 --> 3773.28]  Jeremiah says,
[3773.52 --> 3776.84]  this is what the Lord Almighty,
[3777.02 --> 3777.96]  the God of Israel,
[3778.16 --> 3779.50]  says to all those
[3779.50 --> 3781.06]  who I carried into exile
[3781.06 --> 3781.84]  from Jerusalem
[3781.84 --> 3783.04]  to Babylon.
[3783.04 --> 3785.10]  Build houses
[3785.10 --> 3786.18]  and settle down.
[3786.84 --> 3787.60]  Plant gardens
[3787.60 --> 3788.82]  and eat what they produce.
[3789.10 --> 3790.20]  Marry and have sons
[3790.20 --> 3790.74]  and daughters.
[3790.92 --> 3792.18]  Find wives for your sons
[3792.18 --> 3793.48]  and give your daughters
[3793.48 --> 3794.02]  in marriage
[3794.02 --> 3794.82]  so that they too
[3794.82 --> 3795.56]  may have sons
[3795.56 --> 3796.08]  and daughters.
[3796.62 --> 3798.14]  Increase in number there.
[3798.30 --> 3799.46]  Do not decrease.
[3800.24 --> 3800.88]  Also,
[3801.38 --> 3802.30]  seek the peace
[3802.30 --> 3803.10]  and prosperity
[3803.10 --> 3804.06]  of the city
[3804.06 --> 3805.70]  to which I have carried you
[3805.70 --> 3806.58]  into exile.
[3807.08 --> 3808.54]  Pray to the Lord for it
[3808.54 --> 3810.96]  because if it prospers,
[3811.14 --> 3811.86]  you too
[3811.86 --> 3813.28]  will prosper.
[3815.32 --> 3815.96]  So as
[3815.96 --> 3818.68]  beloved foreigners
[3818.68 --> 3819.78]  and exiles,
[3820.52 --> 3820.96]  live
[3820.96 --> 3821.98]  and work,
[3822.50 --> 3822.96]  produce,
[3823.12 --> 3824.38]  produce families,
[3824.60 --> 3825.84]  set down roots,
[3826.02 --> 3826.84]  find joy
[3826.84 --> 3827.62]  and fulfillment
[3827.62 --> 3828.84]  in your labors.
[3829.00 --> 3830.18]  Work for the well-being
[3830.18 --> 3831.40]  of the city
[3831.40 --> 3832.38]  for its peace
[3832.38 --> 3834.10]  and its prosperity.
[3834.72 --> 3835.74]  That's what among
[3835.74 --> 3837.78]  means for Peter.
[3838.78 --> 3840.22]  Live such good lives
[3840.22 --> 3841.90]  among the pagans
[3841.90 --> 3844.14]  that though they accuse you
[3844.14 --> 3845.10]  of doing wrong,
[3846.86 --> 3847.16]  you see,
[3847.24 --> 3847.80]  this is
[3847.80 --> 3850.18]  the part that says
[3850.18 --> 3851.36]  what you do
[3851.36 --> 3852.14]  in holiness
[3852.14 --> 3853.52]  to God
[3853.52 --> 3855.84]  won't make sense.
[3857.34 --> 3858.28]  Denying yourself
[3858.28 --> 3859.50]  and taking up your cross
[3859.50 --> 3861.08]  and following Jesus
[3861.08 --> 3862.14]  won't make sense
[3862.14 --> 3863.56]  to those who only know
[3863.56 --> 3864.24]  the cross
[3864.24 --> 3865.52]  as folly
[3865.52 --> 3866.82]  and as a stumbling block.
[3867.86 --> 3869.62]  In a sex-saturated,
[3869.76 --> 3870.18]  immediate,
[3870.34 --> 3872.10]  pleasure-seeking culture,
[3872.50 --> 3873.42]  Christians actually
[3873.42 --> 3874.60]  raising the bar
[3874.60 --> 3875.62]  of sexual purity
[3875.62 --> 3876.50]  and excellence
[3876.50 --> 3876.94]  together
[3876.94 --> 3878.44]  is just weird.
[3879.72 --> 3880.46]  In a world
[3880.46 --> 3881.06]  that tells you
[3881.06 --> 3881.56]  to look out
[3881.56 --> 3882.26]  for number one,
[3882.34 --> 3883.70]  to protect yourself
[3883.70 --> 3884.56]  and then maybe,
[3884.88 --> 3885.88]  if they deserve it,
[3885.92 --> 3886.50]  your family,
[3887.36 --> 3888.44]  sacrificial loving
[3888.44 --> 3889.14]  of strangers
[3889.14 --> 3889.84]  and aliens,
[3890.00 --> 3891.48]  of literal refugees
[3891.48 --> 3892.78]  is abnormal.
[3894.30 --> 3895.36]  When we are told
[3895.36 --> 3895.88]  that the way
[3895.88 --> 3896.66]  to have peace
[3896.66 --> 3897.50]  and security
[3897.50 --> 3898.14]  in the world
[3898.14 --> 3898.98]  is to exercise
[3898.98 --> 3899.92]  your power
[3899.92 --> 3900.72]  and to,
[3901.02 --> 3902.60]  what's the language,
[3902.78 --> 3904.34]  to let your light shine,
[3905.60 --> 3906.86]  Christians who willingly
[3906.86 --> 3907.98]  give up peace
[3907.98 --> 3908.82]  and security
[3908.82 --> 3910.06]  to enter into
[3910.06 --> 3910.66]  the chaos
[3910.66 --> 3912.12]  of global mission,
[3912.52 --> 3914.00]  who reject power
[3914.00 --> 3914.98]  in order to sit
[3914.98 --> 3916.22]  and share a meal
[3916.22 --> 3917.44]  with the marginalized,
[3918.78 --> 3920.54]  you will look strange.
[3922.18 --> 3923.00]  And look,
[3923.86 --> 3926.36]  it's always been this way
[3926.36 --> 3927.84]  for Christians
[3927.84 --> 3929.04]  who are properly
[3929.04 --> 3931.30]  living in this identity.
[3932.56 --> 3934.68]  There's a Roman historian
[3934.68 --> 3937.22]  from the second century.
[3937.50 --> 3938.14]  So this is,
[3938.14 --> 3938.48]  you know,
[3938.60 --> 3940.68]  60 or 70 years
[3940.68 --> 3941.92]  after Peter writes.
[3942.96 --> 3944.14]  His name is Tacitus.
[3945.50 --> 3946.74]  And he tells
[3946.74 --> 3948.52]  in his history
[3948.52 --> 3949.90]  that Christians
[3949.90 --> 3951.12]  are, quote,
[3951.20 --> 3953.26]  hated for their abominations.
[3954.46 --> 3955.32]  What he means by that
[3955.32 --> 3957.04]  is that they have upset
[3957.04 --> 3958.78]  the social order
[3958.78 --> 3960.54]  by changing
[3960.54 --> 3962.28]  the sexual ethic.
[3962.28 --> 3963.14]  They have upset
[3963.14 --> 3964.10]  the social order
[3964.10 --> 3967.30]  by redefining gender
[3967.30 --> 3970.44]  in a more egalitarian perspective,
[3971.08 --> 3972.60]  redefining the social order
[3972.60 --> 3973.64]  where slaves
[3973.64 --> 3975.44]  have become elevated
[3975.44 --> 3976.22]  and raised up
[3976.22 --> 3976.82]  as leaders
[3976.82 --> 3977.46]  in churches
[3977.46 --> 3978.42]  and communities
[3978.42 --> 3980.00]  and then are exercising
[3980.00 --> 3980.62]  authority
[3980.62 --> 3982.72]  over their earthly masters.
[3984.16 --> 3985.10]  Tacitus actually
[3985.10 --> 3986.56]  calls Christians
[3986.56 --> 3987.62]  and say that he,
[3987.82 --> 3988.24]  that they,
[3989.24 --> 3989.26]  quote,
[3989.26 --> 3990.52]  exercise a deadly
[3990.52 --> 3991.88]  and dangerous
[3991.88 --> 3993.24]  superstition.
[3994.20 --> 3994.68]  And Christians
[3994.68 --> 3995.08]  even,
[3995.26 --> 3996.12]  according to Tacitus,
[3996.68 --> 3998.30]  practice cannibalism.
[4000.16 --> 4000.64]  Now,
[4000.68 --> 4001.16]  why do Christians
[4001.16 --> 4002.20]  practice cannibalism?
[4003.26 --> 4004.32]  Because of the Lord's Supper.
[4005.70 --> 4005.92]  Right?
[4006.02 --> 4006.70]  Jesus said,
[4006.80 --> 4008.22]  unless you eat my flesh
[4008.22 --> 4009.22]  and drink my blood.
[4010.08 --> 4011.34]  And so that went out.
[4011.38 --> 4012.14]  And that's weird.
[4012.92 --> 4013.68]  And let's be honest,
[4013.74 --> 4014.28]  it is.
[4014.28 --> 4017.16]  If it's not weird to you,
[4017.66 --> 4019.38]  either you're apathetic
[4019.38 --> 4019.92]  to it
[4019.92 --> 4021.66]  or you've been here
[4021.66 --> 4022.28]  for so long
[4022.28 --> 4023.10]  that it's just normal
[4023.10 --> 4024.22]  and praise God for that.
[4024.54 --> 4025.60]  Because it's weird.
[4026.42 --> 4027.26]  Christians actually,
[4027.44 --> 4028.22]  according to Tacitus,
[4028.42 --> 4030.36]  are charged with atheism.
[4031.68 --> 4032.82]  The first atheists
[4032.82 --> 4033.40]  in the world
[4033.40 --> 4034.32]  are actually Christians.
[4034.46 --> 4034.66]  Why?
[4034.92 --> 4035.86]  Because they refuse
[4035.86 --> 4037.10]  to acknowledge
[4037.10 --> 4038.10]  the Greek and Roman
[4038.10 --> 4039.04]  pantheon of gods.
[4039.14 --> 4039.90]  They refuse to
[4039.90 --> 4041.02]  worship the emperor
[4041.02 --> 4042.42]  as an incarnation
[4042.42 --> 4043.88]  of the divine.
[4044.28 --> 4048.20]  one of the normal,
[4048.46 --> 4049.98]  ordinary Roman practices
[4049.98 --> 4050.74]  in the world
[4050.74 --> 4051.38]  of that day
[4051.38 --> 4052.58]  was something called
[4052.58 --> 4053.56]  infant exposure.
[4054.22 --> 4056.20]  And this is an atrocious practice,
[4056.34 --> 4056.84]  but to be honest,
[4056.88 --> 4057.46]  it's not really
[4057.46 --> 4058.70]  that far different
[4058.70 --> 4060.34]  than some cultural practices
[4060.34 --> 4060.90]  of abortion.
[4061.92 --> 4062.44]  But the idea
[4062.44 --> 4063.22]  of infant exposure
[4063.22 --> 4063.92]  is that
[4063.92 --> 4066.62]  people would have children
[4066.62 --> 4067.60]  and they would prefer
[4067.60 --> 4068.92]  to have boys
[4068.92 --> 4071.76]  and if they didn't have a boy
[4071.76 --> 4072.64]  or if they already
[4072.64 --> 4073.52]  had more children
[4073.52 --> 4073.94]  than they could
[4073.94 --> 4074.74]  properly support,
[4075.10 --> 4075.70]  they would take
[4075.70 --> 4076.42]  these kids
[4076.42 --> 4077.26]  who were just born
[4077.26 --> 4078.04]  as infants
[4078.04 --> 4078.74]  and they would place
[4078.74 --> 4079.62]  them in the garbage heap
[4079.62 --> 4080.44]  outside of the city
[4080.44 --> 4080.98]  and they would just
[4080.98 --> 4081.46]  walk away.
[4083.44 --> 4083.64]  Now,
[4083.68 --> 4084.44]  that sounds atrocious
[4084.44 --> 4085.10]  to us,
[4085.48 --> 4086.66]  but it was perfectly
[4086.66 --> 4087.64]  normal
[4087.64 --> 4089.18]  in Roman society
[4089.18 --> 4091.36]  except for Christians
[4091.36 --> 4094.08]  who saw that practice
[4094.08 --> 4094.54]  and said,
[4094.66 --> 4094.76]  no,
[4094.82 --> 4096.06]  we're going to make changes.
[4096.06 --> 4098.16]  And so they would go out
[4098.16 --> 4099.86]  to the garbage heaps,
[4100.04 --> 4101.24]  gather up these infants
[4101.24 --> 4102.10]  and then raise them
[4102.10 --> 4102.86]  as their own.
[4103.74 --> 4105.22]  There's actually a story,
[4105.68 --> 4107.76]  whether it's fully true,
[4107.82 --> 4108.46]  we can't tell
[4108.46 --> 4109.22]  based on the history,
[4109.34 --> 4110.46]  but the shepherd of Hermes
[4110.46 --> 4111.42]  who became a Christian leader
[4111.42 --> 4112.10]  in the early church,
[4112.54 --> 4113.52]  he is thought to have been
[4113.52 --> 4114.30]  one of these infants
[4114.30 --> 4115.70]  who were discarded at birth
[4115.70 --> 4116.80]  and then was raised up
[4116.80 --> 4117.54]  and became someone
[4117.54 --> 4118.72]  who wrote and led
[4118.72 --> 4119.76]  in the church.
[4120.72 --> 4123.30]  This was absolutely weird
[4123.30 --> 4125.22]  and abnormal behavior
[4125.22 --> 4127.00]  and yet it was precisely
[4127.00 --> 4128.48]  where the Christians
[4128.48 --> 4129.24]  knew they had to be.
[4130.00 --> 4131.20]  None of this made sense
[4131.20 --> 4132.64]  in the world of the day.
[4133.82 --> 4133.90]  Right?
[4134.58 --> 4135.92]  It's because Christians
[4135.92 --> 4138.34]  are accused of ruining society,
[4139.10 --> 4140.90]  of ruining the normal system.
[4140.98 --> 4141.46]  And honestly,
[4141.60 --> 4142.72]  if you could be empathetic to it,
[4142.74 --> 4143.24]  think about it.
[4143.80 --> 4146.98]  If you live in a farming community
[4146.98 --> 4148.72]  outside of the city of Rome,
[4148.72 --> 4150.98]  you know that the rain comes
[4150.98 --> 4152.82]  and that plants germinate
[4152.82 --> 4154.18]  because you have offered
[4154.18 --> 4155.16]  the right prayers
[4155.16 --> 4156.52]  to the right gods
[4156.52 --> 4157.68]  of fertility and growth
[4157.68 --> 4158.42]  in the right way
[4158.42 --> 4159.50]  at the right time of year.
[4160.22 --> 4162.32]  But if one person or family
[4162.32 --> 4163.62]  in your farming collective
[4163.62 --> 4164.72]  becomes a Christian
[4164.72 --> 4166.34]  and then he and his family
[4166.34 --> 4167.32]  stop worshiping
[4167.32 --> 4168.46]  these traditional gods
[4168.46 --> 4170.52]  and then the crop fails
[4170.52 --> 4172.20]  or insects come
[4172.20 --> 4173.76]  and destroy everything
[4173.76 --> 4174.92]  or there is a drought,
[4175.36 --> 4176.32]  whose fault is it?
[4177.76 --> 4178.66]  Well, there's only one person
[4178.66 --> 4179.12]  to blame.
[4180.32 --> 4181.42]  It's those Christians.
[4182.76 --> 4182.88]  Right?
[4182.94 --> 4184.34]  Their belief is dangerous
[4184.34 --> 4186.54]  to the normal ordering
[4186.54 --> 4187.52]  of society.
[4187.68 --> 4188.92]  It's messing with the fabric
[4188.92 --> 4190.98]  of life and culture.
[4192.60 --> 4193.74]  I want to ask you,
[4194.52 --> 4197.72]  is your belief dangerous?
[4199.50 --> 4201.84]  Is your faith radical?
[4201.84 --> 4201.92]  biblical?
[4203.12 --> 4203.66]  Or,
[4203.90 --> 4206.02]  is God just another tool
[4206.02 --> 4206.74]  in your bag
[4206.74 --> 4207.38]  to accomplish
[4207.38 --> 4208.38]  your prosperity?
[4210.78 --> 4213.40]  Is church just another community
[4213.40 --> 4215.52]  where you can be used
[4215.52 --> 4217.26]  and where you can use others
[4217.26 --> 4218.06]  to accomplish
[4218.06 --> 4219.38]  the Canadian dream
[4219.38 --> 4219.96]  of ease
[4219.96 --> 4221.18]  and status?
[4222.78 --> 4224.48]  Live such good lives
[4224.48 --> 4225.38]  among the pagans
[4225.38 --> 4226.90]  that though they accuse you
[4226.90 --> 4227.76]  of doing wrong,
[4227.76 --> 4229.48]  they may see your good deeds
[4229.48 --> 4231.34]  and glorify God
[4231.34 --> 4232.24]  on the day
[4232.24 --> 4234.40]  he visits us.
[4235.56 --> 4236.54]  And that's it.
[4237.36 --> 4239.06]  That's the point of it all.
[4239.22 --> 4239.34]  Right?
[4239.40 --> 4240.44]  Why do you abstain
[4240.44 --> 4241.88]  from sinful desires
[4241.88 --> 4242.92]  like a warrior?
[4243.62 --> 4244.68]  Why do you live
[4244.68 --> 4246.02]  as beloved foreigners
[4246.02 --> 4247.28]  and exiles?
[4247.28 --> 4248.54]  Why do you endure
[4248.54 --> 4249.92]  accusation
[4249.92 --> 4250.66]  and hardship
[4250.66 --> 4251.44]  and opposition
[4251.44 --> 4253.04]  and weirdness
[4253.04 --> 4254.36]  and peculiarity?
[4255.94 --> 4257.50]  For the glory
[4257.50 --> 4259.64]  of God.
[4260.10 --> 4261.50]  For the glory of God.
[4261.60 --> 4263.56]  There is no greater reason.
[4263.72 --> 4265.20]  There is no greater purpose.
[4266.12 --> 4267.30]  And you've really
[4267.30 --> 4268.44]  got to believe that.
[4268.78 --> 4268.92]  Right?
[4268.96 --> 4270.06]  You've got to be sold
[4270.06 --> 4270.86]  on the idea
[4270.86 --> 4271.84]  that God's glory
[4271.84 --> 4274.48]  really is your greatest joy.
[4274.70 --> 4275.76]  You've got to buy into
[4275.76 --> 4277.22]  that hook, line, and sinker.
[4277.48 --> 4279.56]  That Jesus is your all in all.
[4279.80 --> 4281.46]  You've got to really believe that.
[4281.68 --> 4283.18]  Like Paul says in Philippians
[4283.18 --> 4285.20]  that the traditional markers
[4285.20 --> 4286.40]  of success and power
[4286.40 --> 4287.66]  and status in society
[4287.66 --> 4288.78]  are rubbish,
[4289.08 --> 4289.58]  are garbage.
[4289.90 --> 4290.86]  Literally, he says,
[4290.94 --> 4291.42]  and I'll keep it
[4291.42 --> 4292.26]  in polite company here,
[4292.42 --> 4293.66]  he says that they're BS
[4293.66 --> 4296.68]  compared to the surpassing
[4296.68 --> 4298.60]  greatness of knowing God.
[4299.96 --> 4301.60]  It's only when you know God
[4301.60 --> 4302.36]  that way
[4302.36 --> 4304.72]  can you live this way.
[4307.28 --> 4308.44]  And knowing God that way
[4308.44 --> 4310.42]  only comes one way.
[4311.34 --> 4312.22]  Peter makes this clear
[4312.22 --> 4314.06]  in the rest of the chapter.
[4314.78 --> 4315.54]  We didn't read it,
[4315.64 --> 4317.46]  but with Bibles before you
[4317.46 --> 4318.48]  or on the screen,
[4318.74 --> 4321.64]  look at verse 21.
[4321.64 --> 4325.86]  To this you were called
[4325.86 --> 4329.32]  because Christ suffered for you,
[4329.76 --> 4330.86]  leaving you an example
[4330.86 --> 4331.74]  that you should follow
[4331.74 --> 4332.48]  in his steps.
[4333.22 --> 4334.74]  He committed no sin
[4334.74 --> 4335.80]  and no deceit
[4335.80 --> 4337.12]  was found in his mouth.
[4337.84 --> 4339.58]  When they hurled insults at him,
[4339.64 --> 4340.64]  he did not retaliate.
[4341.18 --> 4342.22]  When he suffered,
[4342.74 --> 4343.88]  he made no threats.
[4344.96 --> 4345.28]  Instead,
[4345.68 --> 4347.26]  he entrusted himself
[4347.26 --> 4349.84]  to him who judges justly.
[4351.68 --> 4352.76]  He bore himself,
[4352.96 --> 4354.92]  he himself bore our sins
[4354.92 --> 4356.60]  in his body on the cross
[4356.60 --> 4359.12]  so that we might die to sins
[4359.12 --> 4361.22]  and live for righteousness.
[4362.32 --> 4364.04]  By his wounds,
[4364.14 --> 4365.18]  you have been healed.
[4366.86 --> 4368.74]  For you were like sheep
[4368.74 --> 4369.64]  going astray,
[4370.38 --> 4371.88]  but now you have returned
[4371.88 --> 4372.56]  to the shepherd
[4372.56 --> 4374.16]  and overseer
[4374.16 --> 4375.64]  of your souls.
[4380.18 --> 4383.02]  He himself bore our sins
[4383.02 --> 4384.72]  in his body
[4384.72 --> 4386.10]  on the cross
[4386.10 --> 4389.22]  so that we might die to sins
[4389.22 --> 4392.04]  and live for righteousness.
[4394.26 --> 4397.30]  The way to have relationship
[4397.30 --> 4398.34]  with God,
[4398.44 --> 4399.40]  the way to live
[4399.40 --> 4400.40]  in the manner
[4400.40 --> 4402.06]  that God has called you to live
[4402.06 --> 4403.20]  and is equipping you to live
[4403.20 --> 4405.50]  is to see Jesus.
[4406.70 --> 4408.12]  To see that he has lived
[4408.12 --> 4409.34]  the life I should have lived
[4409.34 --> 4411.02]  and that by his grace,
[4411.16 --> 4412.58]  he grants me
[4412.58 --> 4414.02]  somehow in this
[4414.02 --> 4415.80]  great divine exchange
[4415.80 --> 4417.14]  his righteousness
[4417.14 --> 4418.84]  and that that exchange
[4418.84 --> 4421.34]  also takes my sin
[4421.34 --> 4422.10]  and the punishment
[4422.10 --> 4423.60]  that I deserve for that
[4423.60 --> 4424.88]  and puts it on him
[4424.88 --> 4426.12]  so that on the cross,
[4426.56 --> 4427.92]  he bears it
[4427.92 --> 4429.96]  in my place.
[4431.22 --> 4432.12]  He lived the life
[4432.12 --> 4432.90]  I should have lived
[4432.90 --> 4433.92]  and died the death
[4433.92 --> 4435.28]  that I deserve
[4435.28 --> 4437.64]  so that by his grace
[4437.64 --> 4438.96]  we might live
[4438.96 --> 4440.50]  in righteousness
[4440.50 --> 4442.28]  with him.
[4447.08 --> 4448.88]  Notice here.
[4450.46 --> 4451.78]  Not only does Jesus
[4451.78 --> 4453.76]  accomplish this identity
[4453.76 --> 4457.26]  and give it to you,
[4457.26 --> 4459.28]  but then he is also
[4459.28 --> 4461.90]  held up as our example.
[4463.24 --> 4464.64]  He's held up as
[4464.64 --> 4466.58]  the one whom we are
[4466.58 --> 4467.46]  to mirror
[4467.46 --> 4468.90]  in the world
[4468.90 --> 4470.82]  and in our relationships.
[4472.88 --> 4474.64]  And in this section here,
[4475.30 --> 4476.64]  Peter highlights
[4476.64 --> 4479.76]  three key relationships
[4479.76 --> 4483.20]  wherein you can reflect
[4483.20 --> 4486.18]  this gospel truth.
[4486.18 --> 4489.54]  we read the first
[4489.54 --> 4490.42]  relationship,
[4490.92 --> 4491.08]  right?
[4491.14 --> 4493.02]  The civic relationship
[4493.02 --> 4494.68]  in verse 13 through 17.
[4495.44 --> 4495.54]  Right?
[4495.66 --> 4496.26]  Submit yourselves
[4496.26 --> 4496.98]  to the Lord's sake
[4496.98 --> 4498.36]  for every human authority,
[4498.50 --> 4499.38]  whether to the emperor
[4499.38 --> 4500.68]  as supreme authority
[4500.68 --> 4501.54]  or to the governors.
[4501.68 --> 4502.14]  Verse 17,
[4502.28 --> 4503.20]  show proper respect
[4503.20 --> 4503.96]  to everyone.
[4504.48 --> 4505.06]  Love the family
[4505.06 --> 4505.66]  of believers.
[4505.92 --> 4506.50]  Fear God
[4506.50 --> 4508.34]  and honor the emperor.
[4510.22 --> 4510.70]  Now,
[4511.70 --> 4512.42]  again,
[4512.80 --> 4513.68]  real quick,
[4513.68 --> 4514.90]  in case you
[4514.90 --> 4516.02]  don't know this,
[4516.12 --> 4518.84]  but two or four years
[4518.84 --> 4519.80]  after Peter
[4519.80 --> 4521.52]  writes this letter,
[4522.78 --> 4523.24]  Nero,
[4524.42 --> 4525.46]  historians say,
[4525.76 --> 4527.14]  starts to lose his mind
[4527.14 --> 4528.72]  and he starts
[4528.72 --> 4530.34]  killing Christians,
[4530.92 --> 4531.54]  burning them
[4531.54 --> 4532.60]  at the stake.
[4534.32 --> 4535.52]  He was emperor
[4535.52 --> 4536.62]  when Peter said,
[4537.62 --> 4540.48]  submit yourselves
[4540.48 --> 4541.78]  for the Lord's sake
[4541.78 --> 4543.06]  to every human authority.
[4544.52 --> 4545.14]  Fear God,
[4545.80 --> 4547.10]  honor the emperor.
[4551.58 --> 4553.12]  One of the ways
[4553.12 --> 4554.28]  that we,
[4554.82 --> 4555.82]  as Christians,
[4556.08 --> 4557.46]  might look weird
[4557.46 --> 4560.04]  is by honoring
[4560.04 --> 4561.92]  the civic authorities
[4561.92 --> 4563.62]  that are placed
[4563.62 --> 4564.22]  in our midst.
[4565.46 --> 4565.84]  Now,
[4565.88 --> 4566.26]  I get that
[4566.26 --> 4567.22]  that has to be careful
[4567.22 --> 4568.20]  and that some of you
[4568.20 --> 4569.02]  are going to push back
[4569.02 --> 4569.24]  and say,
[4569.32 --> 4569.36]  well,
[4569.36 --> 4570.02]  what if they call me
[4570.02 --> 4570.86]  into disobedience
[4570.86 --> 4571.76]  and call me into sin
[4571.76 --> 4572.60]  and so on and so forth?
[4574.66 --> 4575.50]  I'm happy to have
[4575.50 --> 4576.52]  that discerning conversation
[4576.52 --> 4577.00]  with you.
[4577.52 --> 4578.80]  But the starting point
[4578.80 --> 4581.26]  has to be
[4581.26 --> 4582.98]  submit yourselves
[4582.98 --> 4584.04]  for the Lord's sake.
[4585.20 --> 4586.38]  Is that your starting point?
[4586.70 --> 4587.34]  Because that's what
[4587.34 --> 4589.00]  a witness looks like.
[4589.06 --> 4590.44]  That's what a living example
[4590.44 --> 4591.46]  looks like.
[4592.10 --> 4592.80]  The next one there
[4592.80 --> 4593.12]  is,
[4593.62 --> 4595.48]  it's referred to
[4595.48 --> 4596.72]  directly as slaves,
[4596.84 --> 4599.08]  verse 18 through 20 there.
[4599.08 --> 4600.32]  Slaves in reverent fear
[4600.32 --> 4600.80]  submit,
[4601.64 --> 4602.46]  reverent fear of God,
[4602.56 --> 4603.40]  submit yourselves
[4603.40 --> 4604.54]  to your masters.
[4605.80 --> 4607.18]  But there's a bigger context
[4607.18 --> 4608.64]  in which we can understand this.
[4608.72 --> 4608.82]  Now,
[4609.22 --> 4610.24]  I want to be really clear
[4610.24 --> 4611.00]  about two things.
[4611.12 --> 4611.30]  One,
[4611.76 --> 4613.48]  slavery in the Roman Empire
[4613.48 --> 4615.12]  is not the same
[4615.12 --> 4616.60]  as the sort of
[4616.60 --> 4617.68]  racist,
[4618.00 --> 4619.12]  chattel slavery
[4619.12 --> 4621.46]  that we are familiar with
[4621.46 --> 4622.24]  in American
[4622.24 --> 4623.54]  and Canadian history.
[4624.04 --> 4625.18]  It is not the same,
[4625.26 --> 4626.42]  but it's not so different
[4626.42 --> 4627.50]  as to just be okay.
[4627.50 --> 4628.46]  Right?
[4628.50 --> 4629.40]  It's still slavery,
[4629.62 --> 4632.54]  but it is part of the
[4632.54 --> 4635.38]  ordinary economic life
[4635.38 --> 4637.02]  of the empire.
[4637.46 --> 4638.96]  And people would willingly
[4638.96 --> 4640.34]  sell themselves
[4640.34 --> 4641.20]  into slavery
[4641.20 --> 4642.44]  in order to pay down a debt
[4642.44 --> 4643.10]  or in order to
[4643.10 --> 4644.12]  free someone
[4644.12 --> 4644.82]  or in order to
[4644.82 --> 4645.96]  get the charity
[4645.96 --> 4647.36]  of a particular patron
[4647.36 --> 4648.78]  or a well-to-do person
[4648.78 --> 4649.32]  in society
[4649.32 --> 4649.94]  so that they could
[4649.94 --> 4651.04]  advance their station.
[4652.24 --> 4652.36]  Right?
[4652.36 --> 4653.76]  There's lots of accounts
[4653.76 --> 4655.22]  actually of slaves
[4655.22 --> 4658.08]  having received
[4658.08 --> 4659.40]  their freedom
[4659.40 --> 4661.40]  and then entering
[4661.40 --> 4663.14]  into the Senate,
[4663.40 --> 4663.86]  for instance,
[4664.00 --> 4665.04]  in the Roman world.
[4667.32 --> 4668.50]  And so really,
[4668.72 --> 4669.30]  I think,
[4669.72 --> 4670.60]  maybe the best way
[4670.60 --> 4671.58]  to understand this
[4671.58 --> 4672.62]  is as it pertains
[4672.62 --> 4674.92]  to our economic life,
[4675.32 --> 4676.66]  as it pertains
[4676.66 --> 4679.08]  to your vocational life.
[4680.12 --> 4681.80]  The way you work,
[4682.12 --> 4683.50]  the way you respect
[4683.50 --> 4684.22]  your boss
[4684.22 --> 4686.20]  or the way you be a boss,
[4686.36 --> 4688.46]  the way you do
[4688.46 --> 4690.88]  the tasks that are set out
[4690.88 --> 4691.44]  for you
[4691.44 --> 4692.64]  is an opportunity
[4692.64 --> 4695.26]  to be a living example,
[4695.26 --> 4696.38]  is an opportunity
[4696.38 --> 4697.32]  to proclaim
[4697.32 --> 4699.82]  the truth of God.
[4699.82 --> 4703.18]  And then finally,
[4703.74 --> 4706.16]  in chapter 3,
[4706.68 --> 4707.80]  the first seven verses,
[4708.82 --> 4710.76]  there's a holding out
[4710.76 --> 4712.34]  of married life
[4712.34 --> 4715.78]  as a place to be,
[4716.16 --> 4717.76]  as a place to be
[4717.76 --> 4718.54]  as an example.
[4719.12 --> 4719.78]  Particularly,
[4720.56 --> 4722.26]  in the first section there,
[4722.34 --> 4722.82]  for women
[4722.82 --> 4724.50]  who are submitting themselves
[4724.50 --> 4725.42]  to the husbands,
[4725.76 --> 4726.62]  and you hear that,
[4726.70 --> 4727.64]  just to the husband,
[4727.64 --> 4727.98]  okay?
[4728.68 --> 4729.76]  But particularly,
[4729.82 --> 4731.56]  to unbelieving husbands,
[4731.98 --> 4733.90]  so that even if they
[4733.90 --> 4735.20]  don't hear the words,
[4735.30 --> 4736.24]  they might be won over
[4736.24 --> 4737.44]  by the behavior
[4737.44 --> 4738.94]  of their wives.
[4739.76 --> 4739.94]  Right?
[4740.00 --> 4741.48]  There's an opportunity
[4741.48 --> 4744.02]  in our marriage relationships
[4744.02 --> 4745.10]  to model
[4745.10 --> 4746.86]  the gospel of Jesus
[4746.86 --> 4748.64]  in incredibly beautiful
[4748.64 --> 4750.86]  and powerful ways.
[4752.10 --> 4753.50]  This is what it means
[4753.50 --> 4755.48]  to be living examples,
[4755.84 --> 4756.72]  beloved of God,
[4756.72 --> 4757.16]  foreigners,
[4758.04 --> 4758.78]  and exiles.
[4758.78 --> 4760.08]  Now notice carefully
[4760.08 --> 4762.06]  that I've just introduced
[4762.06 --> 4762.84]  those to you.
[4763.40 --> 4763.96]  I haven't told you
[4763.96 --> 4764.48]  how to do it.
[4765.40 --> 4766.50]  That's your job.
[4766.50 --> 4771.00]  So in your civic life,
[4771.34 --> 4773.30]  in your economic life,
[4773.30 --> 4775.00]  in your communal life,
[4775.58 --> 4777.12]  how will you be
[4777.12 --> 4779.10]  a living example?
[4780.46 --> 4781.40]  My prayer for you
[4781.40 --> 4781.96]  is that you are
[4781.96 --> 4783.38]  so captivated
[4783.38 --> 4784.84]  by the glory of God
[4784.84 --> 4786.00]  and the gospel of Jesus
[4786.00 --> 4787.56]  that this just oozes
[4787.56 --> 4788.90]  out of you.
[4790.44 --> 4791.02]  And yet,
[4791.08 --> 4791.96]  I know it's going to be hard.
[4791.96 --> 4794.36]  And I know that we're
[4794.36 --> 4795.00]  going to stumble
[4795.00 --> 4796.74]  and we're going to fall
[4796.74 --> 4798.02]  and we're going to struggle
[4798.02 --> 4799.32]  in doing this.
[4799.42 --> 4800.56]  And many of us,
[4800.56 --> 4803.06]  like my 13-year-old self,
[4803.14 --> 4804.38]  are not going to like
[4804.38 --> 4805.52]  being weird.
[4807.60 --> 4808.62]  But here's the thing.
[4810.08 --> 4811.96]  When we are all weird together,
[4812.58 --> 4814.20]  it's not really that weird.
[4815.90 --> 4816.38]  Right?
[4816.44 --> 4817.24]  When we are all
[4817.24 --> 4819.30]  foreigners and aliens together,
[4819.30 --> 4819.36]  together,
[4819.86 --> 4821.64]  we do have a community.
[4822.16 --> 4823.16]  We do have a place.
[4823.64 --> 4824.64]  We do have a family
[4824.64 --> 4827.38]  whereby we can be encouraged
[4827.38 --> 4829.42]  as living examples.
[4830.82 --> 4831.74]  And so this week,
[4831.82 --> 4832.34]  as you go,
[4832.70 --> 4834.18]  be those living examples
[4834.18 --> 4837.16]  and then come back
[4837.16 --> 4839.60]  so we can hear about it.
[4840.24 --> 4841.64]  Come back so we can share it.
[4841.72 --> 4842.66]  Come back so we can offer
[4842.66 --> 4843.74]  encouragement and prayer
[4843.74 --> 4845.18]  and struggle and tears
[4845.18 --> 4846.04]  and crying
[4846.04 --> 4850.82]  because we are living examples.
[4851.44 --> 4851.70]  Amen?
[4852.90 --> 4853.86]  Let's pray together.
[4860.32 --> 4861.22]  Lord our God,
[4861.98 --> 4863.54]  send us out now
[4863.54 --> 4865.20]  in the power of your word
[4865.20 --> 4867.70]  by the working of your Holy Spirit.
[4867.86 --> 4868.80]  Send us out now
[4868.80 --> 4870.82]  captivated and convicted
[4870.82 --> 4872.78]  by the truth of the gospel.
[4872.78 --> 4873.90]  Send us out now
[4873.90 --> 4875.72]  our hearts stirred
[4875.72 --> 4877.34]  having seen your glory
[4877.34 --> 4878.92]  and our imaginations
[4878.92 --> 4880.00]  for how we might
[4880.00 --> 4883.16]  serve you invigorated.
[4885.80 --> 4886.94]  Send us out
[4886.94 --> 4888.86]  so that we might be
[4888.86 --> 4890.74]  living examples.
[4892.44 --> 4893.52]  Send us out
[4893.52 --> 4894.80]  so that we might live
[4894.80 --> 4896.06]  such good lives
[4896.06 --> 4896.96]  among the pagans
[4896.96 --> 4899.04]  that though they accuse us
[4899.04 --> 4899.66]  of doing wrong,
[4900.36 --> 4902.02]  they may see your good deeds,
[4902.02 --> 4904.04]  see our good deeds,
[4904.38 --> 4906.12]  and glorify you
[4906.12 --> 4907.76]  on the day you visit.
[4908.28 --> 4909.50]  In your name we pray.
[4910.38 --> 4910.94]  Amen.
[4910.94 --> 4911.04]  Amen.
[4932.02 --> 4950.06]  Take my life and let it be
[4950.06 --> 4951.84]  constant,
[4951.90 --> 4952.52]  great,
[4952.52 --> 4955.26]  and Lord to thee.
[4955.72 --> 4958.02]  Take my moments
[4958.02 --> 4960.88]  and my days,
[4960.88 --> 4963.20]  let them flow
[4963.20 --> 4966.32]  in endless praise.
[4966.32 --> 4968.68]  Let them flow
[4968.68 --> 4971.32]  in endless praise.
[4975.32 --> 4978.20]  Take my hands
[4978.20 --> 4981.16]  and let them move
[4981.16 --> 4984.26]  at the impulse
[4984.26 --> 4986.56]  of thy love.
[4987.02 --> 4989.02]  Take my feet
[4989.02 --> 4991.34]  and let them be
[4991.34 --> 4994.46]  swift and beautiful
[4994.46 --> 4997.34]  for thee.
[4997.34 --> 5000.54]  Swift and beautiful
[5000.54 --> 5002.74]  for thee.
[5005.30 --> 5008.56]  Take the noise
[5008.56 --> 5011.80]  and let me sing
[5011.80 --> 5013.46]  always,
[5013.46 --> 5018.34]  only for my King.
[5018.34 --> 5021.66]  take my lips
[5021.66 --> 5025.66]  and let them be
[5025.66 --> 5029.82]  filled with messages
[5029.82 --> 5032.66]  from thee.
[5032.66 --> 5037.72]  Filled with messages
[5037.72 --> 5040.66]  from thee.
[5040.66 --> 5047.98]  take my love
[5047.98 --> 5048.98]  and let them be
[5048.98 --> 5049.98]  for me.
[5049.98 --> 5050.98]  Take my love,
[5050.98 --> 5051.98]  my Lord,
[5051.98 --> 5052.98]  I pour
[5052.98 --> 5053.98]  that thy feet
[5053.98 --> 5055.98]  its treasure
[5055.98 --> 5056.98]  soar.
[5056.98 --> 5059.98]  Take myself
[5059.98 --> 5063.98]  and I will be
[5063.98 --> 5065.30]  never,
[5065.30 --> 5066.30]  never,
[5066.30 --> 5067.30]  never,
[5067.30 --> 5068.30]  only,
[5068.30 --> 5070.30]  all for thee.
[5070.30 --> 5072.30]  Never,
[5072.30 --> 5073.30]  only,
[5073.30 --> 5077.30]  all for thee.
[5077.30 --> 5099.12]  as you go
[5099.12 --> 5100.22]  this week,
[5100.44 --> 5101.90]  go as living
[5101.90 --> 5102.44]  examples

[5104.02 --> 5105.08]  of grace
[5105.08 --> 5105.70]  and go
[5105.70 --> 5106.80]  in the power
[5106.80 --> 5107.64]  of God
[5107.64 --> 5108.30]  who goes

[5140.06 --> 5140.88]  the Lord.
[5142.10 --> 5142.78]  Amen.
[5155.70 --> 5169.62]  These are the days
[5169.62 --> 5170.94]  of Elijah
[5170.94 --> 5174.48]  declaring the word
[5174.48 --> 5175.74]  of the Lord
[5175.74 --> 5179.38]  and these are the days
[5179.38 --> 5180.90]  of your servant
[5180.90 --> 5181.84]  Moses
[5181.84 --> 5183.06]  as precious
[5183.06 --> 5185.48]  as being restored.
[5187.00 --> 5188.24]  And though these
[5188.24 --> 5189.00]  are days
[5189.00 --> 5191.00]  of great trials
[5191.00 --> 5192.76]  of famine
[5192.76 --> 5194.02]  and darkness
[5194.02 --> 5195.56]  and storm
[5195.56 --> 5198.00]  still we are
[5198.00 --> 5198.82]  the voice
[5198.82 --> 5200.24]  in the desert
[5200.24 --> 5201.30]  crying
[5201.30 --> 5202.48]  preparing
[5202.48 --> 5203.66]  the way
[5203.66 --> 5204.96]  of the Lord.
[5205.34 --> 5206.30]  The holy
[5206.30 --> 5207.60]  comes
[5207.60 --> 5209.12]  riding on the
[5209.12 --> 5210.04]  clouds
[5210.04 --> 5211.40]  shining like
[5211.40 --> 5212.30]  sun
[5212.30 --> 5213.40]  at the
[5213.40 --> 5213.86]  trumpet
[5213.86 --> 5215.40]  called

[5217.26 --> 5219.62]  nearer to believe
[5219.62 --> 5220.54]  and now

[5223.34 --> 5224.40]  comes.
[5232.40 --> 5234.40]  And these are
[5234.40 --> 5235.30]  the days
[5235.30 --> 5236.40]  of Ezekiel
[5236.40 --> 5239.24]  the dry bones
[5239.24 --> 5240.14]  becoming
[5240.14 --> 5241.70]  as much
[5241.70 --> 5243.70]  and these
[5243.70 --> 5244.94]  are the days
[5244.94 --> 5246.56]  of your servant
[5246.56 --> 5247.46]  David
[5247.46 --> 5248.66]  rebuilding
[5248.66 --> 5249.92]  a temple
[5249.92 --> 5251.14]  of bread
[5251.14 --> 5253.42]  and these
[5253.42 --> 5254.64]  are the days
[5254.64 --> 5255.98]  of the harvest
[5255.98 --> 5258.30]  the fields
[5258.30 --> 5259.52]  are as white
[5259.52 --> 5261.68]  in your world
[5261.68 --> 5263.56]  and we are
[5263.56 --> 5265.14]  the laborers
[5265.14 --> 5266.24]  in your vineyard
[5266.24 --> 5267.24]  declaring
[5267.24 --> 5268.24]  declaring
[5268.24 --> 5269.24]  the word
[5269.24 --> 5270.56]  of the Lord.
[5270.94 --> 5271.24]  Behold
[5271.24 --> 5273.24]  he comes
[5273.24 --> 5274.14]  crying

[5275.62 --> 5277.10]  shining like
[5277.10 --> 5278.04]  the sun

[5289.14 --> 5290.24]  comes.
[5290.24 --> 5295.64]  There is no God
[5295.64 --> 5296.94]  like Jehovah
[5296.94 --> 5298.44]  there is no God
[5298.44 --> 5299.54]  like Jehovah
