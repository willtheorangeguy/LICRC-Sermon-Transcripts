• The canon of Scripture refers to the collection of writings recognized as authoritative or the voice of God to his people
• The Old Testament canon was fixed by about the 3rd century BC, and the New Testament canon was officially discerned at the Synod of Hippo in 393 AD
• The church "discerned" which books are authoritative, not decided based on human will or power
• Criteria for canonicity include Catholicity (applicable to the whole church), Antiquity (age), Orthodoxy (accuracy), and Apostolicity (relating to the apostles)
• Not all New Testament books were written by the apostles, but they contain their teaching

• Clinging to the covenant promises of God in times of anger
• The covenant identity of God as a refuge, strength, and help in trouble (Psalm 46)
• Moses' experience of God's character in Exodus 34: compassionate, gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love
• Trusting in God's character when feelings contradict it (e.g. Psalm 13)
• The catechism's teaching on clinging to the covenant identity of God in times of difficulty
• Expressing anger towards God is a valid response, but it's essential to understand that God has reasons and purposes beyond human understanding.
• The Bible gives people license to express their emotions to God, including anger.
• God's sovereignty is necessary for giving meaning and purpose in times of suffering or struggle.
• Community and the presence of others who can speak truth into our lives are crucial for navigating difficult emotions and circumstances.
• Christianity is distinct from other world religions.
• Distinction between religion, irreligion, and gospel
• Definition of religion as earning reward or achieving a goal through work or effort
• Irreligion defined as indifference, hostility, or lack of religious belief
• Contrast between modern secular West being more irreligious than religious
• Explanation of Christianity as the gospel, not about earning salvation but God's action to come to humanity
• Example from Dorothy Sayers' Lord Peter Whimsey Stories illustrating God's action in human history.
• She and Peter fall in love and get married
• Dorothy Sayers writes herself into her Lord Peter Wimsey stories after falling in love with the character's pain and loneliness
• The concept of God writing himself into human history through Jesus Christ
• Christianity is unique because it has a historical foundation, unlike other world religions
• The Bible contains a comprehensive history of the world and its structure
• Christianity is rooted in history and its claims can be historically tested and proven or disproven
• This makes Christianity the most falsifiable religion in the world
• The speaker argues that many religions rely on untestable claims and lack historic details about their central events
• Michael Payton's example is used to illustrate how a false religion would avoid making specific, falsifiable claims
• A hypothetical new religion is proposed, with its founder avoiding detailed, testable claims
• Christianity is presented as different from other religions due to its reliance on historical, verifiable events in the life of Jesus

• Discussion of Acts Chapter 2 in the Bible, specifically the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on Peter and the disciples
• Question: Was the gift of tongues a permanent gift or temporary, given only to the crowd that heard Peter's speech?
• The absence of evidence in the book of Acts does not necessarily mean that speaking in tongues or understanding different languages did not occur.
• The cultural and geopolitical context of the time is relevant to understanding the Pentecost festival described in the book of Acts.
• Aramaic was a common language spoken by Jews in Palestine and Israel, Greek was the lingua franca of the region due to Alexander's conquests, and Latin may have been spoken by Roman officials and people from Rome.
• Hebrew was mainly used for specific religious or high-political events, and it is possible that many people did not understand what was being said during services.
• Neo-Phrygian dialects may also have been spoken, but this is a small chance and would likely be related to Greek.
• The idea of multilingualism and language understanding in ancient contexts
• Discussion of the word "tongues" (glosius) in Greek and its multiple meanings, including tongue, languages, and a special prayer language
• Reference to Acts 2, Acts 19, 1 Corinthians 11-14, and 1 Corinthians 13
• Explanation that the New Testament's use of "tongues" encompasses both human languages and a special spiritual language for communication with God
• Clarification of Paul's statement in 1 Corinthians 13 that love is more important than speaking in tongues.
• Cessationism and the Spirit's operation
• Tongues having an end point to their usefulness
• Special gifts having a defined term of use, unlike love
• Questioning God's existence and seeking understanding through questioning
• The importance of doubting and questioning in perceiving truth and finding God
• The speaker shares a personal story of crisis of faith and existential doubt at age 26 while studying theology
• They describe how they were challenging to be around, and their friends allowed them to express anxiety and process through questioning and crying
• The importance of community in times of crisis of faith is emphasized, with the example that if it weren't for their supportive group, the speaker wouldn't be where they are today
• Quoting Diedrich Bonhoeffer, Christ in another person's heart can be stronger than one's own faith, and doubt is seen as a good thing
• Doubt is a natural part of faith
• Doubt can become toxic if internalized or shouted from the mountaintops without genuine discussion or engagement
• Internal struggles and improper coping mechanisms can result from unresolved doubt
• Evangelical deconversion stories have become more prevalent in recent years, often due to unresolved issues with doubt
• A person has apologized for past harm caused by their book
• They have gone through a public deconversion experience and now promotes deconstruction of faith
• Another example is Rhett and Link, who also went through a public deconversion experience on YouTube
