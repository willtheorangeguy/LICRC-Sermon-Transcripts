[101.00 → 103.00] You're working it up
[103.00 → 107.00] You're working it for all my God
[107.00 → 115.90] Come on and give a shout-out and lift you.

[227.96 → 237.56] When the lies come from every side.
[238.94 → 241.02] To say you're done.
[242.02 → 244.80] To say it's over.
[244.80 → 245.80] I'll remember.
[245.80 → 250.62] I'll remember the thousand times.
[251.10 → 254.02] Your love has won.

[657.90 → 659.90] worship
[659.90 → 661.90] god
[661.90 → 668.48] How is the time to give your love
[668.48 → 675.88] Just as you are to worship
[675.88 → 685.70] Just as you are before your love
[685.70 → 694.08] What may every time you dance in my heart
[694.08 → 698.44] What may every need for love
[698.44 → 703.10] Still in this tragedy remains for those
[703.10 → 708.16] Who I need you, you are
[708.16 → 717.16] Come, how is the time to worship
[717.16 → 726.16] Come, how is the time to give your love
[726.16 → 735.16] Come, just as you are to worship
[735.16 → 741.16] Come, how is the time to worship
[741.16 → 745.16] Just as you are before your love
[745.16 → 750.16] Come, how is the time to worship
[750.16 → 754.16] What may every time you confess you are one
[754.16 → 758.16] What may every need for love
[758.16 → 762.16] Still in this tragedy remains for those
[762.16 → 768.16] Who I need you, you are
[768.16 → 772.16] Building me, we choose to surrender our love
[772.16 → 776.16] Building me, our needs are mine
[776.16 → 781.16] With all our hearts, our minds and strength
[781.16 → 788.16] We gladly do, you are
[788.16 → 796.16] Come, how is the time to worship
[796.16 → 805.16] Come, how is the time to give your love
[805.16 → 810.16] Come, just as you are to worship
[810.16 → 820.16] Just as you are before your love
[820.16 → 824.16] Just as you are before your love
[824.16 → 825.16] Come, how is the time to worship
[825.16 → 827.16] Just as you are before your love
[827.16 → 831.16] Come, how is the time to worship
[831.16 → 861.14] Good morning.
[861.16 → 891.14] Good morning.
[891.16 → 893.16] Good morning.
[893.16 → 897.16] Good morning.
[897.16 → 899.16] Good morning.
[899.16 → 901.16] Good morning.
[901.16 → 903.16] Good morning.
[903.16 → 905.16] Good morning.
[905.16 → 907.16] Good morning.
[907.16 → 909.16] Good morning.
[909.16 → 911.16] Good morning.
[911.16 → 913.16] Good morning.
[913.16 → 923.16] Good morning.
[923.16 → 929.22] here and so we're excited just to see these changes taking place and to be part of that and
[929.22 → 935.86] so keep your eyes out for that. Additionally, I want to just bring to your attention
[935.86 → 943.84] that next week, Sunday night, we are gathering together for what we're calling praise and prayer.
[944.46 → 951.60] So it's an opportunity to gather here at 6 30 p.m. for worship, song, and prayer. You can do that
[951.60 → 959.40] here in person or online as we gather to worship our God together and so the idea is to sing some
[959.40 → 966.72] brand-new songs, sing some old favourites, just to gather together and worship our good God.
[968.00 → 974.38] Also, there's kids choir practice following this service and so you are encouraged to meet
[974.38 → 983.86] at 11 30 or whenever service ends, depending on if I run long this morning, but 11 30 is your target
[983.86 → 992.34] and mine, I promise, in the multipurpose room which is just out there. You can follow Mark and the kids
[992.34 → 997.72] as they go that way. Leslie and Brandon, you have announcements too, right? You're making your way
[997.72 → 1006.56] there. Okay. And for the young adults among us, there is a potluck this coming Friday at 7 p.m.
[1006.56 → 1010.62] If you have any questions about that, you can talk to Josh. Josh, wave your hand. There he is.
[1011.22 → 1017.34] You're encouraged to come. You can come here early to prepare your food, or you can cook it at home,
[1017.46 → 1022.52] wherever that is, and then bring it in for that. Who's going first?
[1022.52 → 1030.34] All right. Good morning. So, Mexico announcement again. So, we are looking at doing Mexico again
[1030.34 → 1034.52] this year. It's looking pretty good with what the restrictions are, what we have to do and all that
[1034.52 → 1039.04] fun stuff. But we just wanted to gauge because it's kind of twofold. I mean, the government's
[1039.04 → 1042.56] allowing us to do it, but then whether you guys are actually going to want to do it, that's a totally
[1042.56 → 1049.04] different ballpark, right? So, we're going to do in the next two weeks here, anybody grade 10 to 12,
[1049.04 → 1054.02] as well as any adults who would like to come, whether it be for building, just seeing what we
[1054.02 → 1058.20] do, Ada, Ada, Ada, or being a youth leader. You're welcome to come out. We're going to do
[1058.20 → 1063.86] like a kind of parent team meeting first before we actually do the sign-up. Just to gauge your
[1063.86 → 1067.12] guys' kind of interest, and if you have any questions, we can answer those at that time,
[1067.24 → 1072.00] and kind of just, we're going to do the little flip on it. So, within the next two weeks, I will be
[1072.00 → 1076.24] sending an email out to all the youth parents anyway, so to see if you're interested, come along,
[1076.24 → 1080.30] come out to the meeting. If you guys aren't going to go to the meeting, but your kids are still going
[1080.30 → 1083.68] to come, and you just don't care, then please email me back saying that, too, just so we can get the
[1083.68 → 1088.68] numbers. Don't just not email, then we don't assume that there's no team coming. Same thing for adults,
[1088.72 → 1092.30] you're welcome to that meeting. I won't be emailing everybody in the church, so if you're an adult that
[1092.30 → 1096.58] wants to come, please just text me, or email me, or Ada, Ada, Ada. So, we just get those numbers going.
[1097.32 → 1101.36] But yeah, it's looking pretty good, so hopefully we can kind of get it going, but I'll send that out
[1101.36 → 1102.30] probably within the next week.
[1105.60 → 1112.90] Matt, am I okay over here or not? Yeah? So, Chris already mentioned that we've seen some painting done,
[1112.96 → 1119.50] which looks fantastic. My understanding is that's been funded by regular church repair budget. We have
[1119.50 → 1126.02] a beautiful stage here, and I don't know if you're into having plywood stuff in your house, but I think it
[1126.02 → 1133.56] needs to be covered. So, the carpet is coming for that, and we've also already ordered the carpet for
[1133.56 → 1140.98] the whole sanctuary to come up to the new gray scheme that we're doing here. My understanding is
[1140.98 → 1145.10] we had to order that carpet because it was going out of production, so it's been ordered, it's being
[1145.10 → 1151.42] paid for, but we're using up all the repair funds to do so, and that wasn't the idea. So, they asked me
[1151.42 → 1157.14] if I would come along and help raise money, and so these are the carpet tiles that are coming.
[1158.00 → 1164.46] They're all going through there. It's going to cost about $24,000 to carpet the stage and the
[1164.46 → 1169.94] sanctuary, and at the same time, I don't know how comfortable you are. Eric, are you comfortable
[1169.94 → 1177.98] over there in that chair? No? No? Well, this one's pretty comfy, I would say. So, there has been a group
[1177.98 → 1184.20] that has figured out what should we do about the chairs, and this was the choice. This is an older
[1184.20 → 1190.44] chair from a local church, so it might look a little bit worn. It's not the chair, but it'll be in a
[1190.44 → 1196.56] colour scheme that goes, but this is the style that we are looking to do. It's about $56,000 to get
[1196.56 → 1204.60] enough chairs for the sanctuary, and so we need $80,000, and it's my job, along with Sylvia and Dick and Sam
[1204.60 → 1210.00] are going to help raise that money, and the sooner we raise it, the sooner we can order chairs. We're
[1210.00 → 1214.10] not going to order them yet. We're going to wait until we've seen the money come in, or at least a
[1214.10 → 1217.80] good chunk of it, and the first dollars coming in, we'll pay for the carpet that's already been
[1217.80 → 1224.04] ordered, and then once we raise enough, we'll order some chairs. So, you'll see in the next week a donation
[1224.04 → 1230.48] form in your mailbox that you can fill out. We'll put a poster board up, and it'll say things like,
[1230.48 → 1236.00] one chair's $140. This is how much for a chair for your whole family. This is how much to carpet
[1236.00 → 1241.60] this much of the church. So, just get an idea of what your money's going to. So, open up your
[1241.60 → 1248.40] wallets. Pray about it over the next week, and when you do donate, it's called Chairs and Squares.
[1248.40 → 1251.48] That's what you need to designate it as. So, thank you.
[1260.48 → 1276.08] Okay. Chairs and Squares. Did you catch that? What a great name. I like branding. For those
[1276.08 → 1281.16] of you who are wondering, we did a pancake breakfast a little while ago. That was fundraising for
[1281.16 → 1285.60] this very thing. We just didn't know it was called Chairs and Squares at the time. So, we
[1285.60 → 1292.64] started that campaign already. We need to continue that work in order to do it well. I believe that's
[1292.64 → 1297.04] it for announcements this morning. Thank you for your patience in that. Can we stand together?
[1298.00 → 1304.44] We might be called by God into his presence. Receive the greeting of our God.
[1306.76 → 1314.06] Grace, mercy, and peace to you. From God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son,
[1314.06 → 1320.02] and our Saviour through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit. All God's people said,
[1321.06 → 1323.42] Amen. Let's worship God together.
[1326.22 → 1330.70] As we join together in worship this morning, no matter our circumstances,
[1331.42 → 1337.16] or how difficult or trying this past week or month or even year has been,
[1337.16 → 1342.88] we can take joy and comfort in Jesus' invitation to all of us in Matthew 11.
[1344.16 → 1352.24] Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened. I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn
[1352.24 → 1360.44] from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy,
[1360.44 → 1367.08] and my burden is light. Please join us as we sing together the joy we have in Jesus Christ.
[1367.08 → 1371.60] The joy of the Lord will be my first.
[1374.08 → 1380.08] The joy of the Lord is my hope this is an excellent Сейчас distractions
[1382.08 → 1383.80] It's for me and my life, that you will give you rest.
[1384.26 → 1389.02] You will have fun to speak over their world of grace, and you will share it as if you are with Goldstein.
[1389.08 → 1391.24] The joy of the Lord will be my strength. I will not falter, I will not цве.
[1391.24 → 1409.48] is
[1415.64 → 1419.48] is
[1421.24 → 1435.24] praise the joy of the lord is my strength
[1435.24 → 1449.24] is
[1451.24 → 1455.24] the joy of the
[1455.24 → 1469.24] will be my strength
[1476.52 → 1483.24] the joy of the lord
[1485.24 → 1491.24] the joy of the lord
[1501.24 → 1508.84] as part of worshipping together we also have the opportunity to admit to ourselves and to god
[1508.84 → 1516.84] that we do not always live as we are called in this time of opening our hearts to god let's remember

[1850.84 → 1864.84] Good morning.
[1864.84 → 1870.84] Today's offering is first for our church's budget and second for C10.
[1870.84 → 1877.84] Ariel and Jody serve under the ministry organization called C10, Commission to Every Nation.
[1877.84 → 1883.84] One of the ministry God has called them to is El Faro, Men's Clean, Sober, and Living Home.
[1883.84 → 1889.84] Currently, they house 15 men, all of whom are working full-time.
[1889.84 → 1896.84] They are working on expanding their housing situation as a home like theirs does not exist in the area of Mexico,
[1896.84 → 1900.84] and they have a waiting list of men waiting to stay here.
[1900.84 → 1911.84] Jody continues to teach English women's Bible study at Calvary Rosarito and homeschool Jonathan and his friend Ricky.
[1911.84 → 1917.84] They have recently taken in two kids and are figuring out living and schooling situations for them.
[1917.84 → 1923.84] Thank you for your continued love and support through their prayers and financial giving.
[1923.84 → 1926.84] From Matthew 25, verse 34 to 40.
[1926.84 → 1929.84] Then the king will say to those on his right,
[1929.84 → 1938.84] Come, you who are blessed by my father, take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you, since the creation of the world.
[1938.84 → 1941.84] For I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat.
[1941.84 → 1944.84] I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink.
[1944.84 → 1947.84] I was a stranger, and you invited me in.
[1947.84 → 1949.84] I needed clothes, and you clothed me.
[1949.84 → 1952.84] I was sick, and you looked after me.
[1952.84 → 1955.84] I was in prison, and you came to visit me.
[1955.84 → 1958.84] Then the righteous will answer him,
[1958.84 → 1963.84] Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?
[1963.84 → 1968.84] When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you?
[1968.84 → 1972.84] When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?
[1972.84 → 1979.84] The king will reply, Truly I tell you, whatever you did for the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.
[1979.84 → 1983.84] Next week's offering is for the Vinculum Ministries of Canada.
[1983.84 → 1984.84] Please give generously.

[2026.24 → 2040.18] You've stood before my failure, and bearing the cross for my shame.
[2040.18 → 2048.42] My sanctuary upon your shoulders, my soul now to stand.

[2422.74 → 2427.94] some time reviewing it especially the budget um information because we're going to be talking about
[2427.94 → 2434.82] that at the meeting as well I was up here last week talking about our uh budget shortfall information
[2434.82 → 2441.94] so I just wanted to keep that on your minds and on your hearts as of now we're 20 percent behind on
[2441.94 → 2448.82] our budget for the year but uh what that works out is we're 20 000 or 23 000 behind on our expenses
[2449.54 → 2455.30] to date so if you can take some time over the next week or the next couple of weeks to prayerfully
[2455.30 → 2469.30] consider that for this church community of ours here thank you

[2485.78 → 2491.46] this Sunday where we can gather together as this group of Christians and also with Christians everywhere
[2491.46 → 2497.38] who are celebrating the resurrection and celebrating the Christian community that they can be a part of
[2497.38 → 2505.22] we thank you that we do not have to worship in isolation or to develop a relationship with you in
[2505.22 → 2511.38] isolation but that we are part of a much larger Christian community where we could feel the love
[2511.38 → 2517.38] of each other and get support to each other too we thank you for this church congregation and the leaders
[2517.38 → 2522.66] that we have we thank you for pastor Chris and for Kevin and for everyone who works on staff and for the
[2522.66 → 2530.18] ministries that they do we thank you for members of council and that we pray that you give them a
[2530.18 → 2536.82] wisdom as in direction as they make decisions for this church community but just as important that
[2536.82 → 2543.62] they'll be able to reach out to all members of this congregation that we will feel the love of
[2543.62 → 2550.66] Christ and the unity that we have in you father we think about all the ministries of this church and
[2550.66 → 2555.06] we thank you for them, we think about those who just left to go for children's worship time we thank
[2555.06 → 2559.14] you for the leaders there and an opportunity to raise their children in the way that they should go
[2559.78 → 2564.66] and when they are old they will not depart from it, we thank you for all the ministries that we have
[2564.66 → 2572.34] we think about cadets the gems our youth our care group the nursery and of course many others that all of
[2572.34 → 2579.46] them in their different ways are providing a network for Christians to uh to be with each other and to draw
[2579.46 → 2586.82] closer to you father we think about the ongoing needs that we have in this church community in our
[2586.82 → 2593.38] neighbourhood and the world around us, we pray especially for Willie and Joanne miles with the
[2593.38 → 2601.22] illness that Willie is facing and the news that he has moved into in for hospice care and is facing
[2601.22 → 2606.74] an end-of-life situation father we thank you for the love and the strength that you have shown them we
[2606.74 → 2615.30] pray that they will continue to feel your presence and take great comfort in Jesus words that he would
[2615.30 → 2620.90] be with us always to the very end of the age we think about other members of this church who are
[2620.90 → 2627.62] facing their own health needs we think about bob and Benita and Janet um we ask that you be with
[2627.62 → 2632.74] them with the treatment that they're getting the care that they are getting uh that you will be close to
[2632.74 → 2640.98] them and that they will feel your strength and your healing as well an ongoing prayer we have and
[2640.98 → 2646.34] the people around us have too as we continue to pray for a world uh that is face that is still facing
[2646.34 → 2654.34] covet and um for many it causes great fear and great anxiety um we also notice that it's an opportunity
[2654.34 → 2661.38] uh that we experience division to that when we disagree with each other sometimes disagree strongly
[2661.94 → 2670.10] uh that it does bring people apart we pray that all of us when we're uh speaking our mind that we
[2670.10 → 2675.54] will be able to speak the truth and love and make the right decisions for the good of the people around
[2675.54 → 2683.06] us we think about all those involved in uh in health care to deal with people who have covet and the other
[2683.06 → 2689.62] crises that we have with those addicted to opioids sometimes we feel a certain sense of helplessness
[2690.42 → 2697.06] we pray lord that good decisions and can be made that we'll be able to take care of them all
[2697.06 → 2702.26] we pray for our elected leaders of all level levels of government we think of those involved in public
[2702.26 → 2707.22] health they have an important task, and it's often a very difficult task too and
[2707.22 → 2714.42] and very often no matter what decisions they make they are going to face opposition for it regardless
[2714.42 → 2718.98] we pray for wisdom for all that they'll make the best decisions that they can and whether they
[2718.98 → 2726.02] acknowledge you or not that they will think about the words from Micah what does the lord require of us
[2726.02 → 2732.42] to act justly to love mercy and to walk humbly with our god, and we pray for all of us and for
[2732.42 → 2739.38] all citizens in our community that we would experience uh patience as we uh face life struggles
[2739.38 → 2745.70] and this health crisis to father we pray for pastor Chris as he leads us in the preaching from your word
[2746.26 → 2752.74] and uh, and so we can learn more about the humble community we thank you for the words from the apostle
[2752.74 → 2759.30] peter and uh the very comforting words that we can cast our anxiety on you because you care for us
[2759.30 → 2764.74] father we pray that you will be with this church community as we worship and celebrate your name
[2764.74 → 2779.30] and we go our separate ways throughout this week we pray these things in Jesus name amen
[2779.30 → 2789.30] and
[2793.94 → 2794.74] let's try again
[2798.50 → 2799.54] and again
[2799.54 → 2809.22] yeah there it is okay awesome thank you back of house for your problem-solving skills
[2811.14 → 2822.02] we uh as we prayed are going to continue in our look at first peter uh this is uh the second to last
[2822.02 → 2828.18] text and uh sermon in this series that we have been together and so encourage you to open your bible
[2828.18 → 2834.90] turn on your bible however that works um as we're going to read from first peter 5 verse 1 through 7
[2835.78 → 2842.34] it will be on the screen I think behind me as we go and so with god's word in front of us let's
[2843.06 → 2844.10] hear what he has to say
[2846.74 → 2855.62] to the elders among you, I appeal as a fellow elder and witness of Christ's sufferings who will also share
[2855.62 → 2865.78] in the glory to be revealed be shepherds of the flock under your care watching over them not because
[2865.78 → 2874.50] you must but because you are willing as god wants you to be not pursuing dishonest gain but eager to serve
[2875.06 → 2880.34] not lording it over those entrusted to you but being examples to the flock
[2880.34 → 2889.86] and when the chief shepherd appears you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away
[2891.62 → 2900.50] in the same way you who are younger submit yourselves to the elders all of you clothe yourselves with
[2900.50 → 2907.30] humility toward one another because god opposes the proud but shows favour the humble
[2907.30 → 2917.14] humble humble humble yourselves therefore under god's mighty hand that he may lift you up in due time
[2918.26 → 2925.70] cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you this is the word of the lord
[2925.70 → 2935.94] so i
[2938.42 → 2945.78] wondered about this introduction for a while and have decided I'm going to go for it but at the risk of
[2945.78 → 2951.62] embarrassing myself I want you to tell me what this is
[2955.70 → 2973.54] I'm not a very good example of that my flexibility isn't what it once used to be
[2975.06 → 2982.58] um you ever watch the Olympics or sports or whatever um and synchronized diving is a good
[2982.58 → 2990.02] example of that or diving in general or um aerial ski is another perfect one where the athlete
[2990.02 → 2996.90] stands at the starting block or even prior to that right and then just goes through the motions
[2998.02 → 3006.58] that they're going to do when they're competing so it's a process uh called visualization
[3006.58 → 3014.42] or guided imagery now this is according to sports psychologists so don't blame me I just read about it
[3015.78 → 3024.74] but the idea is in order to be most effective in the task that you are about to do you have to visualize
[3025.30 → 3032.18] beforehand you have to picture the end and the journey to where you're going to go
[3032.18 → 3042.50] in order to live that well at the moment there's a sports psychologist who I read that says the more
[3042.50 → 3052.50] an athlete can image the entire package the better it's going to be there's another article uh on this that
[3052.50 → 3060.50] says and I'm going to quote this is more than ever a multisensory endeavour which is why the term
[3060.50 → 3066.58] imagery is now preferred to visualization doesn't take in all the senses
[3067.78 → 3072.18] you have to smell it you have to hear it you have to feel it everything
[3074.26 → 3086.42] to make it to the end well you have to be captivated by the image of it throughout the entire exercise
[3086.42 → 3088.02] the journey
[3090.98 → 3098.90] I want to suggest to you some of you have already made this connection that the kind of life that peter
[3098.90 → 3109.86] calls us to as disciples only makes sense when it is based on and lived in light of an unshakeable
[3109.86 → 3114.10] all-satisfying hope beyond this life
[3117.70 → 3125.06] and that the way we endure trial the way we engage suffering the way we remain faithful the way we grow
[3125.06 → 3130.82] in obedience is to visualize or to image
[3130.82 → 3139.94] what's ahead in that life to come here's my idea my theme for this morning that we're going to reflect
[3139.94 → 3148.66] on the kind of living that changes history but that the kind of living that that changes the world
[3148.66 → 3157.46] can only happen when you think beyond history can only happen when you imagine another world when you
[3157.46 → 3162.26] have a vision of the future of from god that is unstoppable
[3164.02 → 3171.22] that's what peter is trying to tell us and that's what the whole New Testament really is trying to
[3171.22 → 3178.82] show us and if you look at Christian history that's what Christian history proves to us
[3180.18 → 3185.14] and so really as a recap as we're nearing the end of this series that we're going to be just for a
[3185.14 → 3191.94] moment look back at where we've gone look back at the letter right in chapter 1 verse 6 and 7
[3191.94 → 3198.02] peter calls us to greatly rejoice in suffering grief and trials
[3198.74 → 3206.98] right in his language even as you face a refining fire your life may result in praise and glory and honour
[3206.98 → 3211.78] right he says you can rejoice now because of the glory promised then
[3211.78 → 3222.74] that's the new birth into a living hope of verse 3 in chapter 1. in chapter 2 11 and 12 we read
[3222.74 → 3228.66] that we go to war against our sinful desires, and we live such good lives among the pagans that even
[3228.66 → 3235.38] though they accuse us of doing wrong, and we do all that so that we might glorify god on the day he visits
[3235.38 → 3244.26] right that the glory of god revealed in Jesus and in the coming of the celestial city of his return heaven
[3244.26 → 3253.22] and earth together because of Jesus right that's the hope for living or the living hope for living in
[3253.22 → 3261.62] this present darkness and then in the rest of chapter 2 in verse 13 and following believers are told to
[3261.62 → 3268.34] submit to every human authority and to be clear right this would include emperors and governors who were
[3268.34 → 3277.38] actively persecuting Christians further slaves are commanded to submit to even harsh masters Christian
[3277.38 → 3286.50] wives are called to do right and to not give way to fear even to unbelieving husbands are instructed to
[3286.50 → 3293.14] live together in wisdom as partners with their wives and hear that right all of this living together
[3293.14 → 3298.74] in wisdom as partners comes in a culture that doesn't consider equality between men and women at all
[3300.02 → 3307.14] and then finally all of us in this section are called not to repay evil for evil or insult with insult
[3307.14 → 3315.30] right on the contrary peter writes repay evil with blessing now how does that make any sense
[3316.50 → 3323.94] it doesn't right not in the culture of the day not even in our culture not in the so-called normal
[3323.94 → 3332.98] operation of human interaction it only begins to make sense if you know of a greater reality than the one
[3332.98 → 3340.42] in front of your face right now and look even as I recap that I know that some of you are going to get
[3340.42 → 3348.50] hung up on the word submit and if you are coming out of an experience of abuse or trauma I get that
[3350.90 → 3357.46] but for most of us don't miss the truth for the ringing in your ears in that word because first
[3357.46 → 3364.34] of all the greatest model of submission is Jesus who prayed right yet not my will be done but yours
[3364.34 → 3370.90] right Jesus who submitted himself to authorities and powers and principalities of this dark age Jesus
[3370.90 → 3377.14] who submitted himself to the cross and then now look at what peter says because he submitted himself
[3377.14 → 3383.78] to the cross in 3 22 Jesus Christ has gone into heaven and is at god's right hand with angels
[3383.78 → 3391.78] authorities and powers in submission to him if you were here last week this is the crown after the
[3391.78 → 3400.82] cross again and then again later or elsewhere in the bible in Ephesians 5 Paul calls us all to submit
[3400.82 → 3407.22] to one another out of reverence for Christ right submitting to god submitting to authorities as his
[3407.22 → 3414.02] representatives husbands to wives to husbands submitting to each other is the economy of gospel
[3414.02 → 3424.50] living and is following the example of Jesus himself who came not to be served but to serve and
[3424.50 → 3432.18] to give his life as a ransom for many, but you can't be afraid of submission when you know the perfect love
[3432.18 → 3441.14] of god that drives out fear but again this kind of mutual submission this kind of lives willing to
[3441.14 → 3449.70] serve lived for the other only makes sense it's its only truly possible when you have hope in another
[3449.70 → 3460.26] life right eternally lived in the experience of the glory of god so let me make this really super abundantly clear
[3461.62 → 3469.06] the kind of life that peter has been calling us to the kind of life that is born out of the gospel
[3469.06 → 3480.58] doesn't make sense to the world it doesn't add up it doesn't look right unless your understanding of
[3481.14 → 3487.94] accounting includes the eternal the economy of Christian living won't add up unless your perspective
[3487.94 → 3495.46] on life includes the end of history and the celestial city of god all you will be ever be able to see is
[3495.46 → 3506.58] what's right in front of you the only way that you beloved will be able to as Peter says in chapter 4 13
[3507.14 → 3514.10] rejoice in as much as you participate in the sufferings of Christ and hear that again right rejoice in as
[3514.10 → 3520.98] much in as much as you participate in the sufferings of Christ so the more you suffer with Christ the more
[3520.98 → 3528.42] rejoicing there ought to be rejoiced in as much as you participate in the sufferings of Christ so that
[3528.42 → 3539.70] you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed right rejoice and be overjoyed there's an in the structure
[3539.70 → 3547.46] of this sentence it's a stacked word pair right the rejoicing is one thing on the lower level and then
[3547.46 → 3555.30] the rejoicing to come will be over and above that it's a stacked up on top of if it's a rejoicing
[3555.30 → 3560.42] and then an overpricing and yes I made up that word but I'm going to use it a few more times so
[3560.98 → 3568.74] come with me, but it is a promise of over joining in the age to come at the full revelation of god's glory
[3568.74 → 3575.70] in the new heavens and the new earth that that then works its way backwards through history to your present
[3575.70 → 3581.54] that enables you to rejoice now even in suffering
[3583.70 → 3593.14] so whether it's a funeral or martyrdom whether it's suffering illness or suffering persecution we
[3593.14 → 3602.50] can sing great is thy faithfulness when the world is crumbling around you or your whole peer group
[3602.50 → 3608.58] is making fun of you because of your faith you can sing it is well with my soul
[3611.22 → 3613.70] forgive me for this but when your husband is an ass
[3615.86 → 3622.74] or when your wife is indifferent when your boss takes advantage of your work ethic or your professor
[3622.74 → 3626.42] is dismissive of your worldview you can raise a hallelujah
[3630.10 → 3635.70] the very beginning of this series or if you've been uh working through or looking at the bible
[3635.70 → 3643.94] study that we provided right on the cover page there I asked a question how does being born into a
[3643.94 → 3653.78] a living hope change the world and this is the answer okay some of you are going to be shocked by
[3653.78 → 3660.02] this but the truth is you cannot change the people in your life some of you have been trying to change
[3660.02 → 3665.22] them for years and the reality is you're going to keep trying to change them for years to come
[3665.86 → 3679.30] because you cannot change people in your life only god does that, but you can change you can change
[3679.30 → 3686.26] your perspective you can change how you show up in certain circumstances and situations and basing
[3686.26 → 3694.50] your life now on an unshakeable all-satisfying hope beyond this life can can literally redefine
[3694.50 → 3701.78] your present circumstances notice carefully right that redefine does not mean change
[3703.54 → 3712.10] right you don't change your present circumstances suffering may still come trial happens hardship is real
[3714.58 → 3723.94] but the meaning that you make at the moment that can be new that can be different that can be redefined
[3724.50 → 3732.34] and when you make a gospel-entered meaning of life and when you are seeing things through the lens of the
[3732.34 → 3742.26] consummation when you are seeing the hardship of this world in light of the glory of heaven that changes you
[3744.50 → 3753.46] and a changed you has an impact of changing the world that the world is transformed communities are transformed
[3753.46 → 3758.34] when you are transformed when the church is being transformed
[3760.58 → 3761.06] and yes
[3763.62 → 3769.46] for those who only see this world it doesn't make sense
[3771.30 → 3777.62] our hope is other worldly our mindset is other worldly
[3777.62 → 3783.22] all rights in Colossians set your mind on things above not on earthly things
[3784.74 → 3793.62] remember in this series in this epistle we have been talking about living as exiles in a pagan land
[3794.50 → 3799.70] and then one definition of paganism that we have been offering through this series is to
[3799.70 → 3810.10] see only this world this system as all there is and so human nature the gods or those things that we treat as
[3810.10 → 3818.50] god-like are all part of this one same system there is no other there is no holy other there is no holy there is no
[3818.66 → 3828.58] transcendent and because there is only one system and the things in it whether that's people or nature or the so-called gods of this world
[3828.58 → 3835.70] all of them can be used and manipulated and coerced for your own benefit for your own peace
[3835.70 → 3839.94] and your own power fundamentally that's paganism
[3841.78 → 3850.74] in Christianity gospel Christianity is something else altogether because our hope is other worldly
[3850.74 → 3859.78] and if you don't believe in anything beyond this world then of course that doesn't make sense
[3861.54 → 3867.14] but the truth for us that we know is that when you come to see god and Jesus when you have been born
[3867.14 → 3875.46] again into this living hope this is actually the only way to make sense of anything in this world it's the only way to see
[3875.46 → 3884.90] here's the hard truth then that the world struggles so much to understand
[3887.94 → 3889.70] any suffering
[3892.34 → 3902.66] hear that any suffering only makes sense if and when consummation and god's glory fills it with purpose
[3902.66 → 3910.66] any rejoicing only makes sense in light of the consummation and god's glory as the utter fulfillment
[3910.66 → 3919.06] and climax of our joy right the truth is an otherworldly hope and an otherworldly mindset is the only way to
[3919.06 → 3928.34] make sense of anything in the world right now and these two threads running through the whole letter of
[3928.34 → 3935.06] peter are pulled into his penultimate discussion here about being a humble community
[3937.22 → 3937.78] he writes
[3938.58 → 3939.86] to the elders among you
[3941.06 → 3945.94] be shepherds of god's flock that is under your care watching over them
[3945.94 → 3949.70] not because you must but because you are willing as god wants you to be
[3949.70 → 3956.74] not pursuing dishonest gain but eager to serve not lording it over those entrusted to you but being examples
[3956.74 → 3958.02] of the flock
[3960.18 → 3968.26] one commentary that I read this week in this section here asks the question of how does this make any sense
[3968.26 → 3976.58] in a world where the very stuff of leadership is coercion and money and power and the answer is it doesn't
[3976.58 → 3979.38] it doesn't it doesn't make sense
[3981.06 → 3981.86] or at least
[3981.86 → 3983.70] it only makes sense
[3983.70 → 3986.02] if what you know is
[3986.02 → 3987.70] and when
[3987.70 → 3990.58] the chief shepherd appears
[3990.58 → 3992.50] you will receive
[3993.06 → 3994.74] a crown of glory
[3994.74 → 3996.18] that never fades away
[3996.18 → 4002.90] but that the kind of living that changes history the kind of living that changes the world
[4002.90 → 4010.02] the kind of leading that changes the church can only happen when you think beyond history when you think of another
[4010.50 → 4011.46] world
[4011.46 → 4014.34] and elders speaking specifically to you now
[4014.34 → 4017.22] elders if you want to be good at your job
[4017.22 → 4021.70] if you want to be faithful to your calling as an under shepherd of Jesus
[4022.66 → 4024.74] you need to be captivated
[4025.06 → 4028.02] completely and utterly captivated
[4028.02 → 4029.46] by this truth
[4030.02 → 4033.06] your hearts need to be full of rejoicing
[4033.06 → 4034.66] and overjoying
[4034.66 → 4035.86] at the consummation
[4035.86 → 4037.78] and the celestial city to come
[4037.78 → 4040.18] your imaginations need to be overwhelmed
[4040.18 → 4041.14] by the beauty
[4041.14 → 4042.34] and the majesty
[4042.34 → 4043.38] of the gospel
[4043.38 → 4045.78] so that you may live and serve
[4045.78 → 4048.02] in the midst of hardship
[4048.02 → 4048.98] and suffering
[4048.98 → 4049.94] and trial
[4049.94 → 4050.50] and
[4050.50 → 4051.62] with purpose
[4051.62 → 4052.26] and joy
[4052.26 → 4054.50] whether that is your suffering and hardship and trial
[4054.50 → 4055.78] or entering into
[4055.78 → 4058.34] the sufferings of others
[4058.34 → 4059.86] to do that with purpose
[4059.86 → 4060.42] and joy
[4060.42 → 4061.70] with integrity
[4061.70 → 4062.98] and with diligence
[4062.98 → 4065.30] you need to be captivated
[4067.06 → 4067.78] by this truth
[4070.42 → 4071.86] but of course not just the elders
[4073.14 → 4073.38] right
[4073.38 → 4074.66] in the same way
[4074.66 → 4076.10] you who are younger
[4076.10 → 4076.34] now
[4077.06 → 4079.38] most scholars agree that that is a term
[4079.38 → 4082.18] that refers to those who are spiritually younger
[4082.18 → 4084.90] as well as those who are numerically younger
[4084.90 → 4088.18] the idea really is to catch up everyone who's not serving
[4088.18 → 4089.54] the church as an elder
[4091.54 → 4092.58] in the same way
[4093.38 → 4094.02] peter writes
[4094.74 → 4096.26] submit yourselves
[4097.30 → 4098.10] to your elders
[4099.70 → 4100.66] there's that word
[4100.66 → 4101.70] submit again
[4103.30 → 4107.38] and since the elders calling is to care for and to
[4107.38 → 4110.58] usher you into the presence of Jesus
[4110.58 → 4114.74] whether that's our pastoral elders or me as a teaching elder
[4114.74 → 4118.34] and to be sure I know that in our church tradition we don't really make that kind of
[4118.34 → 4122.34] distinction formally but practically of course we do because
[4123.70 → 4126.26] your pastoral elders aren't up here preaching yet
[4126.26 → 4137.54] since the elders have a responsibility to see you grow in your faith and in your relationship to Jesus
[4137.54 → 4144.74] since the elders may have cause to correct or to teach or to rebuke so that you can be transformed
[4144.74 → 4152.90] ever more into the image of Jesus Christ peter says that we have to submit to their oversight too
[4152.90 → 4158.74] and again to the world around us that doesn't make sense
[4159.54 → 4164.18] and let's let's be honest right because to some of you sitting here right now and who've been
[4164.18 → 4166.18] sitting in a church for your entire lives
[4167.86 → 4169.30] that hardly makes sense to you
[4170.66 → 4173.38] you mean I have to submit to someone else in authority over me
[4174.90 → 4176.34] that's not how we work in this world
[4176.34 → 4186.10] and yet this is the exact structure that Jesus has given his church this is the exact purpose
[4186.10 → 4193.14] that Jesus has designed in his kingdom come and his kingdom coming because the truth is we all
[4193.14 → 4199.38] wander right the truth is we all waver in our commitments and the sad truth is we all walk away
[4199.38 → 4208.02] from obedience at one time or another and the good shepherd who goes after that one lost sheep
[4209.62 → 4214.98] like the good shepherd who goes after that one lost sheep a good elder will go after you
[4216.18 → 4222.66] a good elder will not give up on pursuing you a good elder may have to say enough
[4222.66 → 4227.62] enough it's time to return to obedience faith
[4236.66 → 4239.70] what a good elder does this
[4241.94 → 4242.58] humility
[4245.38 → 4248.34] so the only question left this
[4248.34 → 4254.02] will you also be humble enough to hear it
[4256.18 → 4263.22] all of you clothe yourselves with humility toward one another humble yourselves therefore
[4263.22 → 4272.10] under god's mighty hand that he may lift you up in due time will you be a practicing
[4272.10 → 4273.94] functioning
[4273.94 → 4278.50] meaningful part of our humble community
[4279.94 → 4284.18] will you let this community humble you as it has humbled me
[4286.18 → 4289.30] and sure it makes no sense to the world
[4290.58 → 4296.02] but the kind of living that changes history the kind of living that changes the world can only happen
[4296.02 → 4302.02] when you think beyond history when you think of another world a heavenly one come down the life of
[4302.02 → 4308.74] gospel Christianity only makes sense when it is based on an unshakeable all-satisfying hope
[4308.74 → 4310.50] beyond this life
[4312.34 → 4313.22] and so again notice
[4314.50 → 4316.90] the threads humble yourselves
[4318.02 → 4320.98] so that he may lift you up in due time
[4321.70 → 4327.54] humble yourself now so that he may exalt you with the crown of glory that never spoils
[4327.54 → 4333.54] or fades in light of eternity all of our suffering is light and momentary
[4334.18 → 4340.74] but in the light of eternity the present finally begins to make sense
[4343.38 → 4350.98] cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you
[4350.98 → 4360.34] far from being a spiritual platitude that's offered in a counselling session history reveals this to be true
[4360.34 → 4368.98] cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you history reveals this to be true, and the future proves it
[4368.98 → 4371.14] it
[4371.14 → 4374.90] and so in our worship together visualize
[4376.02 → 4376.26] that
[4377.70 → 4378.82] in your devotion
[4379.62 → 4380.26] imagine
[4381.06 → 4388.58] that in your working, and you're walking, and you're waiting in your heart of hearts be utterly captivated
[4388.58 → 4390.02] by the world to come
[4390.02 → 4393.54] let the gospel redefine your hope
[4394.10 → 4401.70] and your mindset and then and then watch and wait as god transforms your heart your life
[4402.42 → 4406.42] and the world through his church
[4408.90 → 4409.62] picture
[4410.50 → 4410.82] this
[4412.50 → 4414.66] the celestial city
[4414.66 → 4415.86] god
[4415.86 → 4417.38] come down
[4417.38 → 4418.50] the consummation
[4419.22 → 4426.58] of Jesus Christ at the return of Jesus the sound of trumpet with the voice of archangels
[4426.58 → 4432.50] that all those who have gone on in glory before us march with him to this world and that we
[4432.50 → 4440.82] with unveiled faces may see him face to face that we with unveiled faces being clothed now with the
[4440.82 → 4444.50] imperishable may live forever with him
[4445.54 → 4445.86] here
[4447.06 → 4447.86] on this earth
[4448.82 → 4449.86] renewed
