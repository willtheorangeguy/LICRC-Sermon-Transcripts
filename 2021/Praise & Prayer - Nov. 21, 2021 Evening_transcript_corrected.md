[1780.30 → 1786.30] In the stead of ruined sinners
[1786.90 → 1791.30] Hangs the Lamb in victory
[1791.30 → 1797.82] See the price of our redemption
[1797.82 → 1803.30] See the Father's plan on toll
[1803.30 → 1809.56] Bringing many sons to glory
[1809.56 → 1815.30] Grace unmeasured, love untold
[1815.30 → 1829.30] Come, behold the wondrous mystery
[1829.30 → 1829.90] Come, behold the wondrous mystery
[1829.90 → 1835.54] Slain by death, the God of life
[1835.54 → 1841.76] But no grave could e'er restrain Him
[1841.76 → 1847.42] Praise the Lord, He is alive
[1847.42 → 1853.42] What a foretaste of deliverance
[1853.42 → 1858.86] How unwavering our hope
[1858.86 → 1864.28] Christ in power resurrected
[1864.28 → 1894.26] As we will be
[1894.26 → 1896.26] When He comes
[1896.26 → 1897.38] When He comes
[1897.38 → 1900.26] When He comes
[1900.26 → 1902.26] When He comes
[1902.26 → 1906.26] When He comes
[1906.26 → 1908.26] When He comes
[1908.26 → 1910.26] When He comes
[1910.26 → 1912.26] When He comes
[1912.26 → 1915.26] I cast my mind
[1915.26 → 1921.26] To Calvary
[1921.26 → 1928.26] Where Jesus bled and died for me
[1928.26 → 1930.26] I cast my mind
[1930.26 → 1932.26] To Calvary
[1932.26 → 1936.26] Where Jesus bled and died for me
[1936.26 → 1943.26] Jesus bled and died for me
[1943.26 → 1951.26] I see His wounds, His hands, His feet
[1951.26 → 1953.26] My Saviour, my Saviour, my Saviour
[1953.26 → 1958.26] My Saviour, our that cursed tree
[1958.26 → 1966.26] His body bowed and drenched in tears
[1966.26 → 1968.26] They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb
[1968.26 → 1969.26] They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb
[1969.26 → 1973.26] They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb
[1973.26 → 1980.26] The entrance sealed by heavy stone
[1980.26 → 1987.26] The entrance sealed by heavy stone
[1987.26 → 1992.26] Messiah still and all alone
[1992.26 → 1993.26] And all alone
[1993.26 → 1995.26] And all alone
[1995.26 → 2008.26] O praise the name of the Lord our God
[2008.26 → 2011.26] O praise His name
[2011.26 → 2012.26] O praise His name
[2012.26 → 2015.26] Forevermore
[2015.26 → 2019.26] For endless days
[2019.26 → 2024.26] We will sing Your praise
[2024.26 → 2026.26] O Lord
[2026.26 → 2027.26] O Lord
[2027.26 → 2028.26] O Lord
[2028.26 → 2030.26] Our God
[2030.26 → 2038.26] When on the third
[2038.26 → 2042.26] At break of dawn
[2042.26 → 2046.26] The Son of Heaven
[2046.26 → 2047.26] Heaven
[2047.26 → 2049.26] And rose again
[2049.26 → 2051.26] O O O mod
[2051.26 → 2053.26] O O O O Lamb
[2053.26 → 2054.26] O O O Lord
[2054.26 → 2057.96] Where is your sting?
[2058.38 → 2065.30] The angels roar for Christ the King.
[2068.64 → 2077.36] Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God.
[2077.36 → 2084.36] Oh, praise His name forevermore.
[2085.14 → 2092.42] For endless days we will sing Your praise.
[2092.84 → 2098.36] Oh, Lord, oh, Lord our God.
[2098.36 → 2110.54] We shall return in robes of white.
[2110.76 → 2118.14] The blazing sun shall pierce the night.
[2118.14 → 2126.62] And I will rise among the saints.
[2127.28 → 2134.58] My gates transpired on Jesus' face.
[2134.58 → 2164.56] The blazing sun shall pierce the night.
[2164.58 → 2176.58] Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God.
[2177.64 → 2184.78] Oh, praise His name forevermore.
[2184.78 → 2192.22] For endless days we will sing Your praise.
[2192.60 → 2197.78] Oh, Lord, oh, Lord our God.
[2197.78 → 2207.26] Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God.
[2207.26 → 2214.26] Oh, praise His name forevermore.
[2215.08 → 2222.44] For endless days we will sing Your praise.
[2222.44 → 2228.44] O Lord, oh, Lord our God.
[2230.26 → 2236.44] Oh, Lord, oh, Lord our God.
[2252.44 → 2254.44] We come before You.
[2254.44 → 2258.08] We come before You to worship You.
[2260.26 → 2262.02] We come to praise You.
[2262.26 → 2263.60] Praise Your name.
[2263.60 → 2267.60] Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God.
[2267.60 → 2270.60] Praise His name forevermore.
[2270.60 → 2277.28] It is Your name that is holy.
[2277.28 → 2279.28] You make us holy, God.
[2279.28 → 2279.78] You make us holy, God.
[2282.58 → 2285.04] And amidst the chaos of our world,
[2285.38 → 2288.46] it's hard sometimes to praise You.
[2291.04 → 2294.04] But You call us to Yourself.
[2295.56 → 2298.24] You call us to praise You in the storm.
[2298.42 → 2300.90] Your voice is over the mighty waters.
[2300.90 → 2303.14] You are good.
[2306.56 → 2309.02] You are good in amidst the storm.
[2309.20 → 2310.78] You are good in the trials.
[2311.00 → 2312.30] You are good in the hurt.
[2312.46 → 2313.84] You are good in the hard.
[2316.72 → 2318.06] And we praise You.
[2318.76 → 2322.30] We praise You when we're in brokenness.
[2322.44 → 2325.64] We praise You when we're in loss, God.
[2330.90 → 2346.76] We offer You our praise.
[2349.58 → 2352.82] We know that You are here.
[2355.38 → 2358.12] We know that You are in our midst.
[2358.30 → 2360.56] We know that Your Spirit is moving in power.
[2360.90 → 2363.08] Even right now.
[2363.28 → 2367.86] Speaking words of love and affection to our hearts.
[2369.30 → 2373.92] And so, God, as we bask in the glory of Your presence,
[2374.08 → 2377.82] we long for hearts to receive and ears to hear.
[2377.94 → 2381.82] We long for eyes that can see You, Lord Jesus.
[2386.44 → 2389.88] God, we gather together tonight.
[2390.90 → 2391.90] We're here tonight.
[2391.90 → 2392.24] We're here tonight.
[2392.24 → 2396.30] Not just because You have called us here to worship You.
[2397.18 → 2404.24] Not just because all creation proclaims Your name and the glories of Your work in the world.
[2404.58 → 2406.40] You have called us here tonight.
[2406.74 → 2409.14] Not just because it is right, and it is good,
[2409.46 → 2412.64] but because here, together, we glimpse heaven.
[2413.04 → 2417.86] Here, together, we glimpse the very reason You have created this world.
[2417.86 → 2424.06] Here, together, we participate in the purpose for which You have made each one of us.
[2424.26 → 2428.26] To glorify You and enjoy You forever.
[2428.42 → 2431.28] And so, give us joy in praising You.
[2431.46 → 2434.18] Give us joy in our rejoicing.
[2434.58 → 2439.82] Give us joy as we come into Your holy presence.
[2439.82 → 2442.48] Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[2442.82 → 2444.46] Here we are.
[2449.28 → 2453.90] We are here because You are here.
[2453.90 → 2463.48] We are here because within each one of us is a longing for eternity.
[2464.48 → 2469.04] We are here so that we might rest in You.
[2469.04 → 2473.94] And so, we pray.
[2475.14 → 2480.94] Tonight, as we sing songs, as we lift holy hands in worship of You.
[2481.06 → 2484.76] Tonight, as we are anointed in worship,
[2485.12 → 2490.98] that we might participate with the very angels of heaven in singing Your praises.
[2490.98 → 2492.32] That we might sing,
[2492.56 → 2498.70] Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty who was and is and is to come.
[2500.60 → 2503.56] That here, we might see You, Lord Jesus.
[2504.84 → 2510.52] And we might know that You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals
[2510.52 → 2511.96] because You were slain.
[2512.04 → 2517.50] And with Your blood, You purchased for God persons from every tribe and language and people and nation.
[2517.50 → 2523.62] And You have made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve You, our God.
[2523.70 → 2529.00] And that one day, Lord Jesus Christ, we will reign with You forever.
[2532.56 → 2537.98] Until that day, while we wait here.
[2538.64 → 2540.38] We don't wait idly.
[2541.14 → 2544.46] We wait fulfilling Your call to our lives.
[2544.46 → 2551.12] We wait busy at the work that You call us to in mission and proclaiming the gospel,
[2551.36 → 2554.46] in revealing Your kingdom come and Your kingdom coming,
[2554.60 → 2557.10] in works of justice and of mercy.
[2560.24 → 2563.30] And as we wait, we pray,
[2564.00 → 2566.50] come quickly, Lord Jesus.
[2566.50 → 2570.28] As we wait, we pray,
[2570.48 → 2572.70] even so, come.
[2574.22 → 2576.40] Come, Lord Jesus.
[2578.62 → 2579.94] Renew us.
[2580.80 → 2581.62] Fill us.
[2581.94 → 2582.88] Restore us.
[2583.06 → 2584.24] Come, Lord Jesus,
[2584.24 → 2590.46] that we might see the glory of God in You.
[2591.50 → 2592.24] Come.
[2593.14 → 2595.60] In Jesus' name we pray.
[2596.50 → 2621.82] All creation,
[2622.40 → 2624.50] all the earth,
[2624.50 → 2629.62] Make straight a highway, a path for the Lord.
[2630.96 → 2635.90] Jesus is coming soon.
[2639.24 → 2644.48] Call back the sinner, wake up the saints.
[2644.48 → 2649.68] Let every nation shout up your name.
[2649.68 → 2656.12] Jesus is coming soon.
[2659.42 → 2665.72] Like a bride waiting for a groom,
[2665.72 → 2670.58] we'll be a church ready for you.
[2670.74 → 2675.72] Every heart longing for our King,
[2675.72 → 2678.86] we sing, we sing,
[2679.32 → 2686.34] even so come, Lord Jesus come.
[2688.46 → 2696.86] Even so come, Lord Jesus come.
[2696.86 → 2705.18] There will be justice, all will be new.
[2705.88 → 2710.38] Your name forever, faithful and true.
[2712.24 → 2716.86] Jesus is coming soon.
[2716.86 → 2726.54] Like a bride waiting for a groom,
[2726.54 → 2731.24] we'll be a church ready for you.
[2731.40 → 2736.64] Every heart longing for our King,
[2736.64 → 2746.64] we sing, even so come, Lord Jesus come.
[2748.38 → 2756.64] Even so come, Lord Jesus come.
[2756.64 → 2766.80] So we wait, we wait for you.
[2768.80 → 2777.58] God, we wait, you're coming soon.
[2777.58 → 2798.40] God, we wait, you're coming soon.
[2798.40 → 2800.24] God, we wait, you're coming soon.
[2800.24 → 2802.18] Oh, God, we wait, you're coming soon.
[2802.18 → 2807.56] Like a bride waiting for a groom,
[2807.56 → 2812.26] we'll be a church ready for you.
[2812.26 → 2817.80] Every heart longing for our King,
[2818.10 → 2820.14] we sing.
[2820.14 → 2827.80] Like a bride waiting for her groom
[2827.80 → 2832.20] We'll be a church ready for you
[2832.20 → 2837.68] Every heart longing for our King
[2837.68 → 2843.22] We sing even so come
[2843.22 → 2847.72] Lord Jesus come
[2847.72 → 2853.40] Even so come
[2853.40 → 2858.30] Lord Jesus come
[2877.72 → 2887.14] 1 Chronicles 16 23-31
[2887.14 → 2896.48] Sing to the Lord all the earth, proclaim his salvation day after day, declare his glory among the nations, his marvellous deeds among all people.
[2897.72 → 2904.60] For great is the Lord and most worthy of praise. He is to be feared above all gods, for all the gods of the nations are idols.
[2904.60 → 2911.34] But the Lord made the heavens. Splendour and majesty are before him. Strength and joy are in his dwelling place.
[2912.14 → 2916.78] Ascribe to the Lord all you families of nations. Ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.
[2917.82 → 2922.54] Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name. Bring an offering and come before him.
[2922.54 → 2925.14] Worship the Lord in the splendour of his holiness.
[2925.98 → 2930.56] Tremble before him all the earth. The world is firmly established. It cannot be moved.
[2931.10 → 2933.54] Let the heavens rejoice. Let the earth be glad.
[2934.04 → 2936.60] Let them say among the nations, the Lord reigns.
[2936.60 → 2966.58] Let them glorify.
[2966.58 → 2984.88] Let them glorify the King of kings. We will glorify the Lamb. We will glorify the Lamb. Furthermore, we will glorify the Lord of lords, who is the great I Am.
[2984.88 → 3006.56] Lord Jehovah reigns in majesty. We will bow before his throne. We will worship him in righteousness. Furthermore, we will worship him alone.
[3006.56 → 3028.50] He is Lord of heaven, Lord of earth. He is Lord of heaven, Lord of earth. He is Lord of all who live. Furthermore, he is Lord above the universe. All praise to him, we give.
[3028.50 → 3058.48] All praise to him, we give.
[3058.50 → 3088.48] All praise to him, we give.
[3088.50 → 3093.48] and people and nation. You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God,
[3093.94 → 3098.48] and they will reign on the earth. And then I looked and heard a voice of many angels,
[3098.94 → 3103.88] numbering thousands upon thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand. They encircled
[3103.88 → 3108.14] the throne and the living creatures and the elders. In a loud voice they sang, Worthy is
[3108.14 → 3114.02] the Lamb who is slain, receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength, and honour and glory and
[3114.02 → 3119.54] praise. Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea and all
[3119.54 → 3125.06] that is in them singing, To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honour and
[3125.06 → 3131.64] glory and power forever and ever. The four living creatures said amen, and the elders fell down in worship.
[3144.02 → 3166.90] He's coming on the clouds, kings and kingdoms will bow down.
[3166.90 → 3183.98] And every chain will break, as broken hearts declare his praise. Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[3185.82 → 3196.46] Our God is the Lion, the Lion of Judah. He's roaring with power and fighting
[3196.46 → 3223.06] our battles. And every knee will bow before him. Our God is the Lamb, the Lamb that was slain. For the sins of the world, his blood breaks the chains. And every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb.
[3223.06 → 3228.06] Every knee will bow before him.
[3228.06 → 3230.06] Every knee will bow before him.
[3230.06 → 3236.06] So open up the gates, take way before the King of kings.
[3236.06 → 3243.06] So open up the gates, take way before the King of kings.
[3243.06 → 3248.06] Take way before the King of kings.
[3249.06 → 3251.06] The God of kings.
[3253.06 → 3265.06] The God who comes to save is here to set the captives free. Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[3265.06 → 3283.52] Our God is the Lion, the Lion of Judah, He's roaring with power and fighting our battles, and every knee will bow before Him.
[3283.52 → 3308.12] Our God is the Lamb, the Lamb that was slain, for the sins of the world, His blood breaks the chains, and every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb, for every knee will bow before Him.
[3308.12 → 3332.18] Who can stop the Lord Almighty? Who can stop the Lord Almighty? Who can stop the Lord Almighty? Who can stop the Lord?
[3332.18 → 3340.62] Our God is the Lion, the Lion of Judah
[3340.62 → 3346.88] He's roaring with power and fighting our battle
[3346.88 → 3352.24] And every knee will bow before Him
[3352.24 → 3358.86] Our God is the Lamb, the Lamb that was slain
[3358.86 → 3365.06] For the sins of the world, His blood breaks the chains
[3365.06 → 3371.18] And every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb
[3371.18 → 3376.82] Every knee will bow before Him
[3388.86 → 3418.84] For the sins of the Lord
[3418.86 → 3437.00] You are who you say you are
[3437.00 → 3443.34] You'll do what you say you'll do
[3443.34 → 3451.22] You'll be who you've always been to us
[3451.22 → 3453.56] Jesus
[3453.56 → 3464.36] Our hope is in You alone
[3464.36 → 3471.22] Our strength in Your mighty name
[3471.22 → 3479.02] Our peace in the darkest day remains
[3479.02 → 3481.10] Jesus
[3481.10 → 3488.98] This we know
[3488.98 → 3493.22] We will see the enemy run
[3493.22 → 3495.22] This we know
[3495.22 → 3495.98] This we know
[3495.98 → 3500.44] We will see the victory come
[3500.44 → 3502.78] We hold on
[3502.78 → 3507.22] To every promise You ever made
[3507.22 → 3511.22] Jesus, You are unfailing
[3511.22 → 3521.38] Our God through the wilderness
[3521.38 → 3528.56] Our joy in the heaviness
[3528.56 → 3536.36] Our way when it seems there is no way
[3536.36 → 3538.36] Jesus, You are unfailing
[3538.36 → 3538.70] Jesus
[3538.70 → 3543.36] This we know
[3543.36 → 3545.36] This we know
[3545.36 → 3546.36] This we know
[3546.36 → 3550.58] We will see the enemy run
[3550.58 → 3552.36] This we know
[3552.36 → 3557.36] We will see the victory come
[3557.36 → 3558.36] We hold on
[3558.36 → 3559.36] We hold on
[3559.36 → 3560.36] We hold on
[3560.36 → 3563.36] To every promise You ever made
[3563.36 → 3568.36] Jesus, You are unfailing
[3568.36 → 3573.36] We trust You
[3573.36 → 3575.36] We trust You
[3575.36 → 3583.36] Your ways are higher than our own
[3583.36 → 3586.36] We trust You
[3586.36 → 3589.36] We trust You
[3589.36 → 3596.36] Your ways are higher than our own
[3596.36 → 3599.36] We trust You
[3599.36 → 3604.36] We trust You
[3604.38 → 3605.36] We trust You
[3605.36 → 3606.36] We trust You
[3606.36 → 3611.36] Our ways are higher than our own
[3611.36 → 3616.36] We trust You
