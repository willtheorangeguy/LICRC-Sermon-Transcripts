[0.00 → 28.48] He's coming on the clouds, kings and kingdoms will bow down.
[30.00 → 39.02] And every chain will break, his broken hearts declare his praise.
[39.02 → 42.96] But who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[44.34 → 49.56] Our God is the lion, the lion of Judah.
[50.08 → 55.18] He's roaring with power and fighting our battles.
[55.18 → 60.14] And every knee will bow before him.
[60.76 → 66.04] Our God is the lamb, the lamb that was slain.
[66.30 → 71.46] For the sin of the world, his blood breaks the chains.
[71.92 → 76.86] And every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb.
[76.86 → 82.84] Oh, every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb.

[91.84 → 99.58] To open up the gates, make way before the king of kings.
[99.58 → 105.66] Our God who calls to save.
[105.66 → 109.72] He's here to set the captives free.
[110.10 → 113.88] For who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[113.88 → 118.88] Our God is the lion and the lamb and the lamb.
[118.88 → 120.88] Our God is the lion and the lamb.
[120.88 → 126.04] He's roaring with power and fighting our battles.
[126.04 → 130.84] And every knee will bow before him.
[130.84 → 135.84] Our God is the lion and the lamb.
[135.84 → 136.94] Our God is the lamb, the lamb that was slain.
[136.94 → 142.38] For the sin of the world, his blood breaks the chains.
[142.84 → 147.80] And every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb.
[148.06 → 154.00] Oh, every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb.
[154.00 → 183.98] Oh, every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb.
[184.00 → 186.12] let it DE بيت Genesis.
[186.12 → 187.54] But in theannonнееか.
[187.54 → 190.24] Thank you very much to trust.
[190.24 → 192.20] Father, my heart will bow before the lion and the lamb gets over the trench.
[193.46 → 196.16] And every leg we're going to awe of the rib and the lamb.
[196.16 → 197.70] And every knee will bow for the FSI.
[197.70 → 200.74] And everybody will bow before the rod and the lamb.
[200.80 → 202.76] And every Alberta with the royal lamb.

[205.02 → 206.80] And every knee will bow for the fouled street.
[206.80 → 208.80] And every dog will bow for the Viajadaanricuctor and the lamb.
[208.80 → 213.40] And every Cathy will bow for the Lord at the summit of the 7th.
[213.40 → 218.92] Roaring with power and fighting our battles
[218.92 → 223.64] Every knee will bow before Him
[223.64 → 229.66] Our God is the Lamb, the Lamb that was slain
[229.66 → 235.14] For the sin of the world, His blood breaks the chains
[235.14 → 240.56] And every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb
[240.56 → 247.76] Every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb
[247.76 → 258.54] And every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb
[258.54 → 268.60] Every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb
[270.56 → 300.54] I'll see you next time.
[300.56 → 305.98] I started out this morning in the usual way.
[306.78 → 313.26] Chasing thoughts inside my head of all I had to do today.
[314.32 → 320.80] Another time around the circle, trying to make it better than the last.
[321.72 → 327.06] I opened up the Bible and I read about me.
[327.06 → 333.94] I said I'd been a prisoner and God's grace has set me free.
[335.08 → 341.06] And somewhere between the pages, it hit me like a lightning bolt.
[341.06 → 345.22] I saw a bear from deer in front of me.
[345.44 → 349.34] And I heard somebody say, let's go.
[349.98 → 355.22] Saddle up your horse, and we've got a trail to blaze.
[356.84 → 362.34] Through the wild blue yonder, God's amazing grace.
[362.34 → 368.90] Let's follow our leader into the glorious unknown.
[370.18 → 374.68] This is life like no other.
[374.68 → 379.32] This is the great adventure.
[382.32 → 382.96] Yeah.
[382.96 → 386.96] Come on.
[386.96 → 387.96] Get ready.
[387.96 → 391.18] For the ride of your life.
[391.98 → 394.76] You're the big long-faced religion.
[395.76 → 397.68] In a cloud of dust behind.
[398.00 → 399.04] Leaving the world.
[399.12 → 401.88] Discover all the new horizons.
[402.48 → 404.96] Just waiting to be explored.
[405.30 → 409.96] This is the great adventure.
[409.96 → 411.26] Thank you would you like to absorber in front of me.
[411.42 → 414.14] We'll boy in front of you.
[414.42 → 416.64] I was on my train in front of you.
[417.28 → 419.24] There were jobs like no other.
[419.42 → 420.14] I'm a bridge.
[420.20 → 423.96] I love your horse like no other.
[424.44 → 426.78] But they might not believe in Falcon woah.
[426.78 → 431.08] I'll lead her into the glorious unknown
[431.08 → 433.14] To the glory of the Lord
[433.14 → 436.88] This is a life like no other
[436.88 → 441.60] This is a great adventure
[441.60 → 445.48] We'll travel home
[445.48 → 452.98] Good morning and welcome to worship.
[452.98 → 457.00] We are so excited to gather here together.
[457.12 → 459.12] This morning we have the chance to celebrate
[459.12 → 462.80] Profession of Faith later in our service for four people
[462.80 → 466.70] and we are so glad to see God's goodness
[466.70 → 469.00] as we come together to Him.
[469.02 → 471.30] My name is Chris. I'm one of the pastors here.
[471.48 → 473.44] And before we begin our worship in earnest,
[473.50 → 475.38] we have a couple announcements we would like to share
[475.38 → 478.18] with everyone here and on our live stream.
[478.90 → 481.92] First, there's a new ladies group
[481.92 → 484.04] that's starting up called Walk and Talk.
[484.78 → 486.74] And that's being put together by a group of women.
[487.34 → 489.06] Wendy Culverts and Linda Molenkamp
[489.06 → 490.54] are sort of heading the charge in that
[490.54 → 491.16] and a few others.
[491.78 → 494.78] And they have their first meeting this Tuesday night,
[495.12 → 497.66] June 29 at 7.30 p.m.
[497.66 → 499.62] at Derrick Doubleday Arboretum.
[500.42 → 502.72] And so they wanted us to stress that
[502.72 → 503.96] all are welcome
[503.96 → 506.16] and invite your neighbours.
[506.16 → 508.40] Come on out to this ladies group.
[508.52 → 511.10] You're going to walk together around the Arboretum
[511.10 → 513.40] and discuss issues of life and faith
[513.40 → 515.28] and experiencing God's faithfulness.
[515.44 → 518.10] And so gather together with this group of women,
[518.36 → 520.26] be prayed over, pray over someone,
[520.52 → 522.84] and just see what the Lord might do with that.
[523.90 → 527.06] Also, as we are approaching these summer months,
[527.12 → 529.98] we are looking for children's worship time volunteers
[529.98 → 531.74] for the summer months.
[531.74 → 534.50] Nikki hopes to have that schedule
[534.50 → 536.54] for the summer completed this week.
[537.50 → 539.16] And so if we don't get volunteers
[539.16 → 540.38] for a particular Sunday,
[540.58 → 542.58] there will be no children's worship time
[542.58 → 543.48] on that Sunday.
[544.06 → 546.40] And so as someone whose family
[546.40 → 548.40] is really blessed by children's worship time,
[548.78 → 549.26] please volunteer.
[550.38 → 551.28] We would really love it
[551.28 → 553.16] if we could provide that every Sunday.
[554.44 → 557.08] Also, a youth group is meeting tonight,
[557.20 → 559.28] how they will meet at Williams Park.
[559.48 → 560.90] And you have an email to that effect,
[560.90 → 561.78] but if you have any questions,
[561.90 → 562.64] grab Pastor Kevin
[562.64 → 564.74] and he will answer those for you.
[564.86 → 566.30] And then finally,
[567.30 → 569.44] as many of you are no doubt aware,
[569.98 → 570.94] there will be announcements
[570.94 → 573.32] from the provincial government this week
[573.32 → 575.42] that will likely have an impact
[575.42 → 577.10] on how we are able to gather
[577.10 → 578.44] and the sorts of things
[578.44 → 580.48] that we will be able to do
[580.48 → 581.98] and the numbers that we can gather in
[581.98 → 583.04] and all of those things.
[583.18 → 584.94] And so we are waiting with bated breath
[584.94 → 586.22] for what that might mean.
[586.54 → 587.86] We ask for your patience
[587.86 → 589.16] as we wait for that
[589.16 → 590.54] and then our COVID response team
[590.54 → 591.18] and our staff
[591.18 → 592.24] and everybody come together
[592.24 → 594.08] to provide what is best
[594.08 → 595.20] and safe and good
[595.20 → 596.84] for all of us here.
[596.98 → 597.86] And so look for an announcement
[597.86 → 599.16] from us this week
[599.16 → 600.82] as we hear from them.
[601.96 → 602.94] Connected to that,
[603.16 → 604.74] as we are moving back
[604.74 → 606.42] into a more,
[606.54 → 607.74] I'll call it ordinary,
[608.14 → 609.90] experience of worship together,
[610.08 → 611.10] that means we're going to need
[611.10 → 612.76] things like nursery volunteers,
[613.32 → 615.10] not only Children's Worship Time volunteers.
[615.10 → 615.22] volunteers.
[615.86 → 617.84] And so if you are looking
[617.84 → 620.08] to snuggle with a baby
[620.08 → 621.28] or because you haven't done that
[621.28 → 622.10] for 18 months,
[622.30 → 623.60] this is a great opportunity
[623.60 → 625.98] to do that with someone else's kid
[625.98 → 627.36] in a safe and legal way.
[629.96 → 630.70] Yeah, see?
[631.10 → 632.72] We're going to pull whatever we need to
[632.72 → 633.52] in order to get people
[633.52 → 634.14] into the nursery
[634.14 → 635.70] so that families can be blessed by that.
[637.30 → 638.08] If that's something
[638.08 → 639.10] you might be interested in,
[639.34 → 640.44] you can reach out to me
[640.44 → 641.24] or Pastor Kevin
[641.24 → 643.44] and we can figure out
[643.44 → 644.26] how to connect
[644.26 → 645.68] all of that together.
[646.38 → 647.10] We're going to worship
[647.10 → 647.80] our God this morning
[647.80 → 648.74] and so I'm going to invite you
[648.74 → 649.46] as you are able
[649.46 → 650.06] and where you are
[650.06 → 650.80] to stand
[650.80 → 651.90] that you might receive
[651.90 → 653.04] the greeting of our God.
[657.50 → 659.34] God calls us to worship Him
[659.34 → 660.52] and He welcomes us
[660.52 → 662.72] into His presence.
[662.92 → 663.82] Receive the greeting
[663.82 → 665.06] of our God.
[666.16 → 666.60] Grace,
[667.72 → 668.16] mercy,
[668.72 → 669.72] and peace to you
[669.72 → 671.00] from God our Father,
[671.08 → 672.36] from the Lord Jesus Christ,
[672.94 → 673.52] through the presence
[673.52 → 674.12] and power
[674.12 → 675.62] of the Holy Spirit.
[676.34 → 676.78] Amen.
[677.60 → 678.42] Let's worship God.
[683.06 → 684.14] Our call to worship
[684.14 → 684.60] this morning
[684.60 → 686.38] comes from Exodus 15.
[687.88 → 689.50] I will sing to the Lord
[689.50 → 691.10] for He is highly exalted.
[691.94 → 693.44] The Lord is my strength
[693.44 → 694.52] and my defence.
[695.44 → 696.94] He has become my salvation.
[697.90 → 698.80] He is my God
[698.80 → 700.38] and I will praise Him.
[701.02 → 701.98] My Father is God
[701.98 → 703.68] and I will exalt Him.
[704.58 → 705.52] Who among the gods
[705.52 → 706.36] is like you, Lord?
[707.16 → 708.08] Who is like you,
[708.62 → 709.58] majestic in holiness,
[710.38 → 711.24] awesome in glory,
[711.94 → 712.70] working in wonders?
[712.70 → 726.68] My hope is built on nothing less.
[726.68 → 740.78] My hope is built on nothing less.
[740.78 → 746.26] In Jesus' blood and righteousness
[746.26 → 748.26] I dare not trust in Jesus' name.
[748.26 → 754.26] I dare not trust the speediest frame,
[754.26 → 760.64] but only trust in Jesus' name.
[760.64 → 762.64] I dare not trust in Jesus' name.
[762.64 → 767.64] My hope is built on nothing less.
[767.64 → 772.60] My hope is built on nothing less.
[772.60 → 777.36] In Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[777.36 → 783.04] My hope is built on nothing less.
[783.04 → 797.04] is
[801.76 → 811.04] weak made strong in the saviour's love through the storm
[811.04 → 825.04] he is
[825.04 → 839.04] darkness seems to hide his face I rest on his unchanging grace
[839.04 → 843.04] and stormy day
[843.04 → 849.04] my anger holds within the veil
[849.04 → 857.04] my anger holds within the veil
[857.04 → 861.04] Christ alone
[861.04 → 863.04] cornerstone
[863.04 → 867.04] weak made strong
[867.04 → 871.04] in the saviour's love
[871.04 → 873.04] through the storm
[873.04 → 875.04] he is
[875.04 → 877.04] lord
[877.04 → 879.04] lord of all
[879.04 → 887.04] when he shall come
[887.04 → 889.04] with trumpets
[889.04 → 891.04] sound
[891.04 → 895.04] oh may i then
[895.04 → 899.04] in him be found
[899.04 → 905.04] dressed in his righteousness alone
[905.04 → 907.04] faultless

[925.04 → 927.04] the
[927.04 → 933.04] the
[933.04 → 935.04] the
[935.04 → 937.04] the
[937.04 → 939.04] the
[939.04 → 941.04] the
[941.04 → 943.04] the
[943.04 → 945.04] the
[945.04 → 950.16] Colour song, weak and strong
[950.16 → 956.82] His Saviour's love through the storm
[956.82 → 964.44] He is Lord, Lord of all
[964.44 → 973.26] Christ the Lord, colour song
[973.26 → 976.30] He plays strong
[976.30 → 982.74] His Saviour's love through the storm
[982.74 → 989.58] He is Lord, Lord of all
[1003.26 → 1015.60] Please join me in the prayer of confession and assurance.
[1015.60 → 1025.08] O Holy God, we call to you and name you as eternal, ever-present, full of grace and boundless in love.
[1025.88 → 1031.22] Yet there are times, O God, when we fail to recognize you in the dailiness of our lives.
[1031.22 → 1036.60] Sometimes shame clenches tightly around our hearts, and we try to hide from you.
[1037.28 → 1039.00] Sometimes fear makes us small.
[1039.52 → 1041.76] Sometimes doubt invades our hopefulness.
[1042.70 → 1050.00] Holy God, from sunrise to sunset, remind us again of your holy presence hovering near us and in us.
[1050.60 → 1052.04] Forgive us of our sins.
[1052.68 → 1054.60] Free us from shame and self-doubt.
[1054.60 → 1057.76] Help us to honour you better in all we do.
[1058.34 → 1062.42] And help us to live honestly and forever thankful of your grace.
[1063.00 → 1065.42] In the name of Jesus Christ, our Saviour.
[1066.34 → 1066.64] Amen.
[1066.64 → 1066.76] Amen.
[1066.76 → 1070.20] Amen.

[1095.46 → 1096.36] Amen.
[1096.36 → 1096.62] Amen.
[1096.62 → 1099.66] I believe in Jesus.
[1102.30 → 1106.18] I believe He is the Son of God.
[1108.56 → 1113.26] I believe He died and rose again.
[1114.86 → 1118.72] I believe He prayed for us all.
[1120.78 → 1125.72] I believe He is here for us.
[1126.62 → 1156.60] I believe He is here for us.
[1156.62 → 1162.76] I believe He died and rose again.
[1164.32 → 1168.62] I believe He prayed for us all.
[1168.62 → 1198.62] 
[1198.62 → 1204.76] I believe He died and rose again.
[1204.76 → 1210.90] I believe He died and rose again.
[1210.90 → 1217.04] I believe He died and rose again.
[1217.04 → 1223.18] I believe He died and rose again.
[1223.18 → 1229.32] I believe He died and rose again.
[1229.32 → 1235.46] I believe He died and rose again.
[1235.46 → 1241.60] I believe He died and rose again.
[1241.60 → 1243.60] I believe He died and rose again.
[1243.60 → 1247.74] I believe He died and rose again.
[1247.74 → 1253.88] I believe He died and rose again.
[1253.88 → 1255.88] I believe He died and rose again.
[1255.88 → 1262.02] I believe He died and rose again.
[1262.02 → 1264.02] I believe He died and rose again.
[1264.02 → 1270.16] I believe He died and rose again.
[1270.16 → 1272.16] I believe He died and rose again.
[1272.16 → 1274.16] I believe He died and rose again.
[1274.16 → 1280.30] I believe He died and rose again.
[1280.30 → 1282.44] I believe He died and rose again.
[1282.44 → 1284.44] I believe He died and rose again.
[1284.44 → 1286.44] I believe He died and rose again.
[1286.44 → 1287.84] Thank you, the Vertices, for doing that.
[1287.90 → 1291.96] I have a video today, so I'm really hoping that the audio works on that.
[1293.00 → 1295.76] Today, the story is about a ship.
[1295.86 → 1297.36] It's a story about Paul and the Bible.
[1298.36 → 1301.66] Instead of taking all you kids on a boat ride on the Fraser River,
[1301.76 → 1303.46] we decide to take the boat ride to you.
[1304.82 → 1308.36] Before I do that, I'm just going to pray because the video just ends
[1308.36 → 1310.56] and that will be the end of the children's worship.
[1310.80 → 1314.12] I'll pray with the kids right now, and we'll start the video.
[1314.12 → 1316.52] Heavenly Father, thank you so much for this day.
[1317.48 → 1319.84] Thank you for the children in our community and our church
[1319.84 → 1322.42], and I appreciate a blessing they are to all of us.
[1323.04 → 1326.16] Pray that they have a good summer, enjoying your creation,
[1326.98 → 1329.26] being healthy, hanging out with family and friends
[1329.26 → 1333.50] and just relaxing and doing what we're supposed to do in the summer.
[1334.80 → 1337.38] Please bless this service and our time together.
[1337.50 → 1338.46] For Jesus' sake, amen.
[1340.06 → 1340.80] All right, kids.
[1341.00 → 1342.92] Here we are doing children's worship time again.
[1343.00 → 1343.76] Good to see you all.
[1344.40 → 1348.24] Today's story is about Paul in the Bible and this story is called Shipwreck.
[1348.74 → 1350.86] So today we're going to go for a little ride on a ship
[1350.86 → 1354.14] out by Fraser Valley here on the river
[1354.14 → 1358.52] and I'll give you some more information here in a second.
[1358.52 → 1359.72] This ship here we're going to go on.
[1359.84 → 1365.50] It's a nice ship, and we're going to take this thing out by Bray Island here
[1365.50 → 1367.50] and we're going to go for a little tour around Bray Island.
[1367.64 → 1368.22] Hope you enjoyed the trip.
[1368.22 → 1368.46] All right, kids.
[1368.54 → 1370.02] We're here on the water right now
[1370.02 → 1373.68] and we just got the boat in the water, and we're going for a little cruise.
[1373.76 → 1377.76] But I want to introduce you to my chauffeur here right now.
[1377.76 → 1381.68] And he's got a few rules that he needs us to abide by if we're going on this tour.
[1381.68 → 1384.10] Kids, this is my chauffeur for the evening here.
[1384.22 → 1386.08] This is Jake.
[1386.68 → 1387.68] It's actually not Jake.
[1387.78 → 1388.84] It's Captain Jake.
[1388.84 → 1391.54] Okay, so we got to refer to him as Captain.
[1391.68 → 1394.70] So we're going to be calling him I Captain in this video here.
[1394.94 → 1397.48] He's got a couple other rules on this boat.
[1397.56 → 1398.72] What are some of the other rules there?
[1398.86 → 1399.18] Captain.
[1399.86 → 1403.48] Well, rule number one is there's no peeing off the boat.
[1404.12 → 1405.54] No peeing off the side of the boat.
[1405.64 → 1408.12] Okay, well, that's a tough rule.
[1408.20 → 1409.54] So what do we get to do if we got to go pee?
[1409.58 → 1410.88] Do we just got to jump in the water?
[1410.96 → 1412.32] Yeah, we got to jump in the water.
[1412.48 → 1413.76] We got to go straight to shore.
[1414.08 → 1414.32] Okay.
[1414.88 → 1415.66] Any other rules?
[1415.78 → 1416.66] Any other rules?
[1416.66 → 1426.40] Yeah, the rules are since I am the ultimate fisherman, if we do catch a fish, the fish is always bigger by twice the size of what we actually catch.
[1426.66 → 1427.78] Oh, sounds like a good rule.
[1427.88 → 1430.48] Sounds like a rule most fishermen follow.
[1431.38 → 1431.84] All right.
[1432.30 → 1434.54] Other than that, be happy.
[1434.82 → 1435.28] Here we go.
[1435.30 → 1436.84] Here we are cruising up the river.
[1437.52 → 1439.06] Beside us is a jet boat.
[1439.76 → 1440.94] Somebody's going tubing.
[1442.12 → 1443.32] Having a good time.
[1444.82 → 1445.48] Yee-haw.
[1445.48 → 1446.74] All right, Captain.
[1447.06 → 1450.32] I'm not very familiar with these waters, but where are we right now?
[1451.00 → 1452.24] Well, we are right now.
[1452.36 → 1453.70] We are in the Bedford Channel.
[1453.92 → 1456.24] We have Bray Island to the left of us.
[1456.88 → 1461.06] And we have the almighty Fraser River directly in front of us.
[1461.92 → 1462.28] All right.
[1462.32 → 1462.92] Where are we heading?
[1463.64 → 1466.40] We are going to go for a loop around Bray Island.
[1466.58 → 1467.08] All right.
[1467.14 → 1467.58] Here we go.
[1467.64 → 1469.48] Going up the river, you see some pretty interesting things.
[1469.48 → 1475.70] Here on the side of the river just past the airport, there's some, how it looks like a massive houseboat.
[1475.82 → 1476.88] Kind of cool looking thing.
[1478.00 → 1481.48] Anyway, we'll cruise on by here and move on to the next thing.
[1481.54 → 1482.18] All right, Captain.
[1482.18 → 1483.42] I got a question for you.
[1483.42 → 1488.94] Why is it that all these fishing boats are sitting here idle right now, not out in the waters catching fish?
[1489.88 → 1495.64] Well, I kind of think that the fishery is closed right now because there's not a lot of salmon.
[1496.36 → 1500.18] So I think we're trying to protect our salmon by not fishing right now.
[1500.42 → 1501.98] Sounds like a good idea, eh, fisherman?
[1501.98 → 1503.10] I think so.
[1503.16 → 1504.08] I think it's a great idea.
[1504.08 → 1510.20] Well, kids, as we were making our way up the river, we actually found a ship that looks like it's been a little wrecked.
[1510.38 → 1514.16] Looks like it's sinking here on the shore of the Fraser River.
[1514.24 → 1521.12] Not sure what the story is here, but I wonder if the ship Paul was on ended up looking like that after a while,
[1521.20 → 1522.98] after it sunk to the bottom of the sea.
[1523.64 → 1526.66] Kids, here's another kind of cool thing you see when you're on the river.
[1526.74 → 1528.04] Look at this old boat here.
[1528.04 → 1532.22] Looks like it's been left behind and nobody wants it.
[1532.64 → 1533.40] Kids, here we are.
[1533.56 → 1537.70] Here's a lumber mill we found on the side of the river here.
[1537.78 → 1541.14] And there are a lot of lumber mills often found on the side of a river.
[1541.24 → 1546.18] We're going to ask our captain here why are there lumber mills on the side of the river often?
[1547.16 → 1551.74] Well, kids, I think the reason we have lumber mills on the side of the river is because we have log booms
[1552.10 → 1556.52] that float down the river to get the logs to the mill.
[1556.52 → 1559.22] So it's nice and easy and probably cheap.
[1559.76 → 1561.28] All right, thanks for that tidbit.
[1561.60 → 1562.54] So here we are.
[1562.68 → 1568.80] We're just west of the Albion Ferry dock.
[1568.92 → 1571.08] And we found this kind of boat that's sitting in the water.
[1571.16 → 1574.88] It looks like it would make a great restaurant cruise boat down the river.
[1575.04 → 1575.82] But it's sitting here.
[1575.88 → 1578.24] It looks like it's rotting away here on the side of the river.
[1578.62 → 1581.18] I was wondering if you'd give me a little tour of your boat here.
[1581.24 → 1582.52] What do we get going on here?
[1582.62 → 1584.64] This is a nice looking ship we got here.
[1584.64 → 1586.04] Tell me a little bit about your ship.
[1586.38 → 1588.82] Well, this ship is a 2011.
[1589.28 → 1591.80] It is a 12-foot Lund boat.
[1592.46 → 1594.80] She is powered by this bad boy Mere.
[1594.86 → 1598.26] It's a 15-horsepower Mercury motor.
[1599.26 → 1600.40] How fast does she go?
[1600.46 → 1601.42] Like 0 to 60?
[1601.78 → 1602.26] Oh, yeah.
[1602.40 → 1606.42] We can do 0 to 60 in about, I don't think we can make 60, but close.
[1606.58 → 1607.28] Four minutes.
[1607.48 → 1608.28] Four minutes.
[1608.62 → 1611.48] Wow, this is quite the high-performance boat we're in here right now.
[1611.48 → 1614.88] Do you think anybody could tube or ski behind this bad boy?
[1615.24 → 1616.96] Yeah, I think the kids could.
[1617.20 → 1618.02] They're pretty little.
[1618.14 → 1618.50] All right.
[1618.56 → 1620.14] We'll line them up for one of these Sundays.
[1620.28 → 1623.20] We'll take them for a rip behind this machine.
[1623.40 → 1623.80] All right.
[1624.22 → 1624.56] Thanks.
[1624.78 → 1625.40] Thanks, Captain.
[1625.50 → 1625.86] Hey, kids.
[1625.90 → 1628.18] We made another little stop here on the side of the river.
[1628.26 → 1631.80] Here's one of these barges full of wood chips.
[1631.92 → 1633.16] Not sure what they're going to use them for.
[1633.16 → 1637.58] Maybe they're to make paper or toilet paper or some other kind of wood product.
[1637.78 → 1641.88] But this is probably the leftovers of them making lumber for houses and stuff.
[1641.88 → 1646.28] We are just cruising at Mach speed across the river here.
[1647.60 → 1651.42] Checking out some of the houses on the side of the river.
[1652.14 → 1654.94] Making our way back to the boat launch.
[1655.08 → 1657.66] We're heading up the Bedford Channel here.
[1657.66 → 1662.26] On my left here is probably a lot of you have been on a hike just on Bray Island here.
[1662.36 → 1663.88] It's up in behind those trees there.
[1664.68 → 1666.76] We're making our way back up to Fort Langley.
[1667.02 → 1667.26] All right.
[1667.30 → 1667.86] Here we are.
[1668.02 → 1673.04] Kids, we're just about ready to go under the bridge here by Bray Island.
[1674.22 → 1675.42] It's kind of a cool bridge.
[1675.56 → 1676.74] In the summer, there's people.
[1676.96 → 1680.60] I don't know who they would be, but I hear there's people that like to jump off this bridge
[1680.60 → 1683.04] in the summer and get a nice cool dip.
[1683.04 → 1688.78] I don't recommend it, but I hear from people that it's quite fun, though.
[1689.98 → 1690.36] Anyway.
[1692.18 → 1693.20] All right, Captain.
[1693.36 → 1695.56] Thanks for taking me on that cruise down the river.
[1695.64 → 1696.08] Just wondering.
[1696.18 → 1699.66] I was kind of auditioning for a part as your first mate.
[1700.04 → 1700.76] How did I do?
[1701.70 → 1703.60] Well, I hate to break it.
[1703.86 → 1708.04] You did break one of the rules, and I think that rule was...
[1709.04 → 1709.80] I wonder.
[1709.90 → 1711.98] The river's just a little higher tonight.
[1713.04 → 1714.52] Other than that, you did okay.
[1715.98 → 1716.72] Thanks, Captain.
[1717.38 → 1718.48] Until next time.
[1718.62 → 1719.18] Thank you.
[1720.12 → 1720.88] All right, kids.
[1721.04 → 1724.52] I hope you enjoyed that boat ride we went on.
[1724.84 → 1728.24] And the idea with that is to understand what it's like to be on a ship.
[1728.34 → 1732.06] So we thought we'd take you for a little tour on the Fraser River.
[1732.50 → 1733.60] Now it's time for the story.
[1733.68 → 1736.24] We're going to talk to you a bit about the story about Paul and the shipwreck.
[1736.24 → 1739.12] So here's the story.
[1739.68 → 1742.92] So Paul was arrested for telling so many people about Jesus.
[1743.18 → 1746.54] Soon he was put on a ship with other prisoners.
[1746.94 → 1750.08] He was headed for Rome, where he would be...
[1750.08 → 1755.84] Where he'd have to stand before a judge in a court, and they were going to decide whether the stuff he was preaching was good or not.
[1755.84 → 1762.08] So he had a good chance of ending up going to jail for saying words that they weren't happy about.
[1762.08 → 1766.94] So they got on the ship, and Paul says to the crew, it's a bad time to sail.
[1767.10 → 1769.32] They were winter winds, so the winds were howling.
[1769.80 → 1774.02] And he said, we might have trouble, but nobody wanted to listen to Paul because he was just a prisoner.
[1774.14 → 1776.04] So who would listen to a prisoner on a ship?
[1776.12 → 1778.20] So they decided to set sail.
[1779.10 → 1780.02] And Paul was right.
[1780.08 → 1781.38] A vicious storm came.
[1781.94 → 1784.48] Waves like mountains crashed into the ship.
[1785.00 → 1787.12] And the sailors fought hard to keep it afloat.
[1787.92 → 1788.80] Help, they cried.
[1788.80 → 1791.98] They were in a lot of trouble, and they were really worried and scared for their lives.
[1792.08 → 1797.68] Well, the sailors were up above on the top deck of the boat, sailing a ship.
[1797.76 → 1800.00] All the prisoners were down below, and it was really...
[1800.00 → 1802.42] Everything was crashing around them in the bottom of the boat.
[1803.14 → 1807.92] So Paul decided to pray, and he prayed, God, please help us.
[1808.86 → 1813.00] Then an angel appeared to them with a message, and Paul turned to the crew.
[1813.56 → 1817.76] He went up to the top of the boat and said to the crew, listen, he shouted over the thunder and the wind.
[1818.42 → 1820.86] God promised me that I'll get to Rome.
[1822.08 → 1825.32] I'm unscathed, and anyone travelling with me will be safe.
[1825.44 → 1826.62] Have faith and believe.
[1826.62 → 1837.42] Paul was sure that God would save them, even when the ship drifted near island and crack ran into the ground and into a bunch of rocks.
[1837.82 → 1840.08] And the boat broke into lots of pieces.
[1840.86 → 1842.08] Swim, someone shouted.
[1842.62 → 1847.58] And the crew and the prisoners all jumped overboard into the water and swam safely to shore.
[1847.58 → 1850.50] God still wasn't done with Paul.
[1850.62 → 1852.14] He had more work to do for him.
[1852.24 → 1857.66] So that's why he kept him alive through this crazy shipwreck that happened on the sea.
[1858.40 → 1860.34] So God was being faithful to Paul.
[1860.46 → 1862.04] He had a lot of work for Paul to do.
[1862.04 → 1875.40] And this little challenge in the way of being on the ship and in these crazy waters was not going to prevent God from allowing Paul to do his work of spreading the gospel to him, as many people that would listen to him at that time.
[1875.72 → 1879.36] So the idea of the story is God is faithful, and God will take care of you.
[1879.36 → 1882.48] And God has a plan for you.
[1883.06 → 1887.86] So I hope you enjoyed today's story and the activities that we had planned on this video.
[1888.36 → 1889.64] I hope you have a great Sunday.
[1890.02 → 1895.40] I still can't wait to see you all and have you sitting in front of me so I can share more stories with you.
[1895.40 → 1898.54] But I hope that you enjoyed today's story.
[1899.06 → 1899.90] Have a great Sunday.
[1909.36 → 1912.88] All right.
[1912.96 → 1923.12] It is my pleasure to start off what is going to take part in a moment, the professions of faith of four of our lovely young people in this church.
[1924.72 → 1928.82] Last week, we saw two people do this, Ethan and Kira.
[1929.02 → 1930.96] And now we've got four more doing this today.
[1931.08 → 1935.34] And something I didn't announce last week is these people have been waiting for a little while to do this.
[1935.34 → 1939.86] So it was well over a year ago that they attended pastor's class with myself.
[1940.02 → 1943.68] And that wrapped up at about March the 8th.
[1943.70 → 1946.24] And they were ready to do pastor's class right after that.
[1946.30 → 1947.84] And then four days later, everything shut down.
[1947.98 → 1950.84] So we have been waiting in the wings to be able to do these.
[1951.50 → 1953.14] Restrictions have come and gone a little bit.
[1953.34 → 1961.74] But it is just a pleasure to have both Ben and Haley Washer here to do their profession of faith, as well as McKelvy and Carson Grimm, too.
[1961.74 → 1968.64] So the way it is going to work is we are going to have all four of them individually come up, as well as their spiritual mentor to share a little testimony.
[1969.38 → 1974.90] And then afterwards, Pastor Chris will come forward and lead us through the questions and the answers.
[1975.20 → 1978.24] So Ben Washer, I believe, pulled the short straw.
[1978.46 → 1979.64] And he is going to come up first.
[1979.76 → 1981.10] So Ben, come on up here as well.
[1981.32 → 1982.60] And then Mike Prince as well.
[1982.66 → 1984.40] You can come forward at this moment, too.
[1984.74 → 1987.04] He is Ben's spiritual mentor.
[1987.04 → 1991.42] So Ben, you get the microphone, and you get to share why you are here today.
[1991.74 → 1993.50] You can pull your mask right.
[1994.06 → 1996.08] Well, always the short straw for me.
[1996.18 → 1996.86] That's all right, though.
[1998.22 → 1999.76] If you don't know me, my name is Ben.
[1999.92 → 2002.04] I'm the son of Jake and Annette Washer over there.
[2002.50 → 2011.56] And I thought today that if I had one thing I could share, it would be God's faithfulness, both to this church, to my family, and to myself, which is why I can stand here today.
[2011.56 → 2012.00] Thank you.
[2012.00 → 2012.06] Thank you.
[2012.06 → 2012.56] Thank you.
[2012.56 → 2022.94] So about 21 years ago, around this time, I was just a little baby somewhere up here enjoying some nice sermons.
[2023.78 → 2027.00] And although I can remember it, I know that from that point on, I was being shaped.
[2028.00 → 2033.76] I had the privilege of being able to go to Sunday school, do cadets, youth group, Mexico missions.
[2034.44 → 2038.36] I got to listen to Pastor Bill, Pastor Dan, Pastor Chris now.
[2039.60 → 2043.10] And through all this time, I just want to say I'm very thankful for this place, this church.
[2043.42 → 2047.58] I know God's been using this place and the people here, too, as well.
[2047.58 → 2049.74] And that's been really impactful on my life.
[2049.82 → 2057.78] And what I've seen, the kind of journey of Emmanuel, is something that I take with me everywhere I go, whether it's in here, in B.C., or in Ontario.
[2059.10 → 2062.84] To my family, I'd also like to say thank you for raising me.
[2063.92 → 2068.28] Being able to go to Christian schooling has been quite the privilege, quite the honour.
[2069.16 → 2072.60] And I couldn't thank you guys enough for that.
[2077.58 → 2080.56] Yeah, it's really awesome, so thank you.
[2082.18 → 2088.80] To the rest of my family, to my OMA as well, and my OPA is not here today, thank you for being there.
[2090.80 → 2091.86] You guys are amazing.
[2092.52 → 2094.90] And I couldn't be here without you guys.
[2096.54 → 2099.66] I'm privileged to come from a family of a very long line of believers.
[2100.58 → 2106.34] And it's just an amazing thing to see how God has blessed our family over the last few generations.
[2106.34 → 2112.94] And so being able to kind of see how God has walked with our family for that long is an amazing thing.
[2113.02 → 2119.56] And the reason why I get to live this life and choose to be here, because of God's faithfulness to our family.
[2121.12 → 2123.08] So that's what I have to say.
[2123.22 → 2123.60] Thank you.
[2128.80 → 2129.42] Thanks, Ben.
[2129.50 → 2132.44] It takes a lot of courage to get up and share from the heart like that.
[2132.44 → 2136.22] Kev gave me a fancy little portfolio for my little heresies.
[2136.84 → 2141.04] It's a privilege to be able to encourage and share a few words on Ben's behalf.
[2141.60 → 2145.38] I'm Meg Prince, and I have the privilege of being one of Ben's buddies.
[2146.00 → 2153.40] I was also his youth leader, along with Alvin Loss, another young adult in our church.
[2153.40 → 2159.78] And for five years, I was their small group leader with seven guys together from grade 8 to 12.
[2160.62 → 2165.22] It was during that time that I got to know Ben especially well and watch all the guys grow.
[2165.98 → 2169.38] And Ben, I've been praying for you and the other guys in our small group for years.
[2170.86 → 2175.30] And it's moments like these, I speak, I think, on behalf of many youth leaders in this church,
[2176.00 → 2177.80] that we as youth leaders live for.
[2177.96 → 2180.40] These moments where you stand up for what's worth it.
[2180.40 → 2185.64] Yeah, sure, we love the taco dinners, the giant Dutch blitz, the games nights, the youth camps,
[2185.72 → 2188.10] the cheering for hockey games, all that stuff.
[2188.34 → 2189.44] But don't let it fool you.
[2189.92 → 2194.88] The real treat is seeing young men and women explore their relationship with God,
[2195.26 → 2199.74] make a decision for Christ, and follow the call of Romans 10 to profess it.
[2201.16 → 2204.78] Ben, I've got to warn you, this might be as easy as that gets.
[2205.22 → 2206.30] And I'm sure you know that.
[2206.30 → 2211.42] Doing this in this formal way in front of a church family is a pretty easy audience.
[2211.94 → 2216.12] It takes a lot, especially in today's culture, to take a stand for Christ.
[2217.12 → 2220.64] There's going to be many, many more moments ahead of you in your dorm, at a pub,
[2220.94 → 2223.38] in a convo with a friend, at a work site, in your extended family,
[2223.70 → 2228.30] where you will need to stand by your face and in any manner of ways profess Christ.
[2228.30 → 2232.26] In fact, I hope you do have those moments.
[2232.40 → 2236.06] I hope you don't live in a comfort zone, and Christ probably won't let you.
[2236.86 → 2239.00] And God won't let you down in those moments.
[2239.08 → 2243.12] You know this, even by how you just mentioned the theme of faithfulness in your own life.
[2244.04 → 2249.42] Ben, the Holy Spirit is faithfully doing a good work in you and through you.
[2250.02 → 2253.06] And you will be able to testify to his goodness again and again.
[2253.06 → 2256.46] And where have I seen this in and through you?
[2257.16 → 2259.32] Well, just to mention a few highlights over the years.
[2260.14 → 2262.04] You were a cornerstone to our small group.
[2262.50 → 2265.32] You came to everything, and while you were always up for a good laugh,
[2265.40 → 2268.80] you helped keep Bible studies on task with your curious questions and comments.
[2269.50 → 2270.38] Don't let that die.
[2270.96 → 2272.96] If it was just a hangout with the boys,
[2273.78 → 2276.50] you were that thoughtful and inclusive friend where everyone matters.
[2277.00 → 2280.66] And you've always been such a relaxed and safe place for those around you.
[2280.66 → 2283.88] On trips to Tijuana or making enchiladas in my kitchen,
[2284.86 → 2287.56] you happily stepped up and quietly rallied those around you.
[2288.32 → 2291.84] You care about your beliefs, and you have a way with people.
[2292.74 → 2296.26] All that and more are some of the many ways God works through you.
[2297.32 → 2301.88] And while God used all those Bible studies and youth group staff and family,
[2303.24 → 2305.16] God's done the same using you.
[2305.74 → 2307.58] He used you to shape others too.
[2307.58 → 2311.66] These people around you were affected.
[2312.64 → 2313.98] I was shaped in there too.
[2315.44 → 2317.78] I'm glad God nudged you in those ways.
[2318.18 → 2319.36] So thank you for responding.
[2321.12 → 2322.92] And don't forget, it's a process, right?
[2323.30 → 2326.58] Today is a highlight in that big process.
[2327.58 → 2330.56] Cling to the fact that Christ claimed you,
[2330.74 → 2334.34] and the Holy Spirit will be at you for your entire life.
[2334.34 → 2338.08] He's with you in those moments where you may need to profess Christ again,
[2338.40 → 2342.12] and will be using those moments to shape you and others for his glory.
[2342.78 → 2345.74] It's a privilege to have you as a friend and a brother in Christ.
[2345.74 → 2358.16] I am now going to invite Haley Washer to come forward as well,
[2358.24 → 2361.62] as well as her spiritual mentor, her mom, Annette Washer.
[2361.72 → 2363.48] So please come to the front here.
[2366.48 → 2368.48] Okay.
[2368.48 → 2370.48] Okay.
[2374.48 → 2374.92] Okay.
[2375.74 → 2381.92] So I didn't know Ben would do that well,
[2381.98 → 2383.52] or I definitely would have gone first.
[2386.94 → 2388.98] So be patient with me.
[2389.78 → 2394.12] When I was thinking about what to say to you all during this,
[2394.50 → 2396.46] I kept thinking of the phrase,
[2396.46 → 2398.88] it takes a village to raise a child,
[2399.64 → 2402.62] which knowing me and my brothers, it definitely did.
[2402.70 → 2403.38] Sorry, mom.
[2403.38 → 2410.26] My village has been this church, LCS, my friends, and my family, my teachers.
[2410.88 → 2414.50] And I have been so blessed my whole life by so many caring hearts,
[2414.76 → 2416.58] all that have led me here.
[2416.58 → 2424.16] For example, my youth pastors and leaders that have guided me to Alberta for YC and Mexico for mission trips.
[2424.76 → 2427.16] I've had some pretty interesting Bible teachers.
[2427.40 → 2428.00] Thank you, Mr.
[2428.00 → 2428.60] England.
[2429.26 → 2431.04] And of course, all of you.
[2431.62 → 2439.06] I have built a faith in Christ that I can rely on and receive strength from as I go from here to wherever I go in the future.
[2439.06 → 2445.12] So to my village, I am more than grateful for all you've done and how you've helped me grow in Christ.
[2454.86 → 2457.94] Haley, when we talked about testimony, you said,
[2458.02 → 2460.56] Mom, my story is so boring.
[2461.34 → 2463.06] And I remember feeling that way, too.
[2463.78 → 2468.44] Like you, I lived in a Christian home, went to church, Sunday school, gems, youth.
[2468.44 → 2469.62] Christian school.
[2470.38 → 2471.58] No dramatic moments.
[2472.68 → 2476.00] Just a gentle calling from Jesus that's kind of always been there.
[2476.96 → 2479.36] But the more I thought about this boring testimony,
[2479.98 → 2482.82] I remembered that this story isn't about you or me.
[2483.40 → 2484.32] It's God's story.
[2484.98 → 2489.66] And what this story tells is God's faithfulness to many generations of our family.
[2490.84 → 2496.24] Someday, you might meet someone who needs to hear your story about God's faithfulness.
[2496.24 → 2499.24] And also, God's not done writing your story.
[2499.98 → 2509.12] It's my wish that every once in a while, you'll stop and look back on your life and see where God has led you and trust him for your future.
[2509.12 → 2514.80] The verses I picked for you are from Psalm 100, verse 3 to 5.
[2515.80 → 2517.30] Know that the Lord is God.
[2517.72 → 2519.88] It is he that made us, and we are his.
[2520.34 → 2522.80] We are his people and the sheep of his pasture.
[2523.88 → 2526.52] Enter his gates with Thanksgiving and his courts with praise.
[2527.14 → 2529.06] Give thanks to him and bless his name.
[2529.64 → 2530.60] For the Lord is good.
[2531.18 → 2533.08] His steadfast love endures forever.
[2533.42 → 2535.60] And his faithfulness to all generations.
[2535.60 → 2550.20] I'm now going to invite up McKelvy Grimm and her spiritual mentor, Nicole Rook.
[2550.20 → 2550.60] Hello.
[2563.06 → 2569.44] My biggest blessing that I have been given are my families, the Christian schools that I attended, and the church.
[2569.70 → 2573.12] All these communities and people helped me grow in my faith throughout the years.
[2573.12 → 2583.46] When I look back as a child and young teenager, I would have considered myself a Christian, but I relied heavily on the faith of people around me instead of developing my own relationship with God.
[2584.32 → 2587.10] That changed in grade 11 when I switched schools.
[2588.00 → 2594.16] This was a turning point in my faith because everything I had ever known had been turned upside down except for the church and my family.
[2594.78 → 2599.14] Fortunately, both of these communities and my new one pointed me towards Jesus.
[2599.14 → 2606.28] My parents modelled a Christian relationship with God daily and were always willing to have conversations and answer questions.
[2606.92 → 2612.92] I dove into attending youth events and building relationships with my leaders and other youth, which strengthened my faith even more.
[2613.50 → 2623.50] I hadn't picked up my Bible much before this point, but I had a teacher who strongly encouraged me that reading your Bible helps develop a relationship with God.
[2623.86 → 2625.70] I decided to start reading it every night.
[2625.70 → 2630.00] I started in Psalms and Proverbs, which quickly became my favourite books of the Bible.
[2631.24 → 2634.88] I wanted to share one verse that has impacted me greatly.
[2635.26 → 2640.44] This verse is the first verse that I memorized from hearing it and reading it enough without having to for school.
[2640.84 → 2643.96] It's from Proverbs 31, verse 25, which says,
[2644.36 → 2647.78] She is clothed with strength and dignity, and she laughs without fear of the future.
[2648.28 → 2651.68] I'm looking forward to growing in my faith and relationship with God going forward.
[2651.68 → 2652.68] Thank you.
[2655.70 → 2656.70] Thank you.
[2656.70 → 2657.70] Thank you.
[2657.70 → 2658.70] Thank you.
[2660.70 → 2665.20] Kevin did not give me a fancy little domain, so I have my papers.
[2668.26 → 2668.70] Okay.
[2669.06 → 2670.50] Melty, what an exciting day.
[2670.80 → 2673.34] It feels like it's been a long time coming, but you made it.
[2674.06 → 2676.00] So we've known each other for quite some time.
[2676.36 → 2682.18] I was your GEMS leader way back in the day for a little while, and then I got to be your youth leader for five years.
[2682.18 → 2688.68] I was thinking back on our time in youth, and I remember the time that Sarah and I were helping you girls get ready for your Christmas banquet at school.
[2689.24 → 2692.82] We were driving you to the dance, and Sarah and I were, like, blasting the song.
[2692.88 → 2693.86] I think it was the Dixie Chicks.
[2694.32 → 2696.54] And we were singing, like, as loud as we possibly could.
[2696.60 → 2700.36] And I turned, and I looked back, and all of you girls just looked terrified.
[2700.86 → 2706.36] Like, who are these two girls who are going to be our youth leaders for the next however long?
[2707.28 → 2709.08] And look at us now.
[2709.56 → 2712.86] And now I have a wonderful friend who we can go for dinner, and we can go for drinks.
[2713.88 → 2717.40] And Melty, it has been an absolute pleasure watching you grow up.
[2717.58 → 2720.30] You've always had such a kind heart and a willingness to serve.
[2721.08 → 2721.86] You're laid back.
[2722.00 → 2723.92] Go with the flow as long as everyone else is happy.
[2724.40 → 2729.64] One thing that's always impressed me through all the ups and downs of your life is that you've always looked to God.
[2729.64 → 2734.02] I know we talked in youth about how to listen to God and how to be still.
[2734.24 → 2738.06] But I think that's something that has always come naturally to you, whether you know it or not.
[2738.64 → 2743.56] So my encouragement to you as you go through these next stages of life, whenever you're at a crossroads,
[2743.96 → 2746.24] is taken it to God in prayer and worship.
[2746.52 → 2749.56] As long and no matter what, you won't go wrong.
[2749.70 → 2750.86] He will never lead you astray.
[2751.36 → 2753.46] And I just have a couple verses I want to share.
[2753.92 → 2756.84] One I think really speaks to this day in your profession of faith.
[2756.84 → 2761.34] And that is Colossians 2, verse 6 to 7.
[2761.84 → 2768.26] So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your life in him, rooted and built up in him,
[2768.82 → 2772.40] strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness.
[2772.84 → 2775.58] And another verse, I think, just speaks to you and your heart as a person.
[2775.68 → 2776.62] So I'm going to share that to you.
[2777.48 → 2780.08] And that is Philippians 4, verse 4 to 7.
[2781.04 → 2782.34] Rejoice in the Lord always.
[2782.58 → 2783.88] I will say it again, rejoice.
[2783.88 → 2786.28] Let your gentleness be evident to all.
[2786.28 → 2787.52] The Lord is near.
[2787.80 → 2792.82] Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving.
[2794.10 → 2795.52] Present your request to God.
[2795.90 → 2800.78] And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your heart and your mind in Jesus Christ.
[2800.78 → 2814.98] And fourthly, I would like to invite up Carson Grimm to the front here.
[2815.16 → 2821.48] And he couldn't choose one person to speak on his behalf, so he picked both Josh Chamberlain and Nathan Kisser to come forward.
[2821.48 → 2822.48] So you guys can come up, too.
[2832.16 → 2832.90] Hi, everyone.
[2833.62 → 2835.38] I'm Carson Grimm, if you don't know me.
[2835.38 → 2836.38] I'm Carson Grimm.
[2836.38 → 2837.76] And, um, sorry.
[2838.16 → 2842.62] A lot of things have brought me to this point in my life where I want to publicly make my faith my own.
[2843.12 → 2846.60] Even though my faith is my own, multiple things have shaped it.
[2847.30 → 2851.78] My parents and youth leaders have always been there for me through thick and thin in my faith journey.
[2851.78 → 2859.88] They have helped me answer so many questions I've had over the years and have given me all the tools I need to continue my faith life at university.
[2860.42 → 2865.46] They're amazing role models that have shown me all the benefits that having faith in Christ can do in your life.
[2866.32 → 2868.92] Another big reason I'm here is experiences.
[2869.52 → 2872.10] One of them is the Mexico missions trip two years ago.
[2872.40 → 2877.78] This was one of my most favorite trips I've ever been on and has strengthened my faith a lot.
[2877.78 → 2885.16] Through daily team prayers and helping the community in Tijuana, it opened my eyes to multiple different views on faith.
[2885.66 → 2898.88] This trip taught me multiple lessons, but one of them that will stick with me is that people without a lot of materialistic things can still be extremely happy just off their relationship with Christ.
[2899.76 → 2902.38] It is a privilege to be up here today and share my story.
[2902.38 → 2907.22] I'm excited to continue my journey with the help of my family, friends, and the church.
[2907.78 → 2908.78] I'm excited to be here today and share my story with the help of my family.
[2908.78 → 2909.78] I'm excited to be here today, and I'm excited to be here today, and I'm excited to be here today.
[2909.78 → 2910.78] Thank you.
[2910.78 → 2911.78] That was true.
[2919.78 → 2920.78] Okay.
[2920.78 → 2921.78] Sorry about that.
[2921.78 → 2922.78] It's not COVID.
[2922.78 → 2925.48] It's just the emotions.
[2925.48 → 2929.78] Carson is a man.
[2929.78 → 2937.76] And one of the features, character traits of him that I most admire is his name.
[2937.76 → 2940.76] His dedication, his discipline.
[2940.76 → 2950.76] Whatever he sets his mind to, he accomplishes, even if that's making a fool of himself.
[2950.76 → 2959.76] And that I admire because sometimes in the face of hardship or being laughed at, I'll cower, but he won't.
[2959.76 → 2962.76] And I've learned that about him.
[2962.76 → 2963.76] And it's great.
[2963.76 → 2972.76] And a verse that I think that if he applied to his life, which he does in so many ways, is Deuteronomy 6.5.
[2972.76 → 2977.76] Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength.
[2977.76 → 2980.76] His dedication is profound.
[2980.76 → 2985.76] And if he did that in every manner of life, he will continue to be great.
[2985.76 → 2986.76] All right.
[2986.76 → 3002.76] So when I was asked to do Carson's, I mean, first, he asked me like three days ago.
[3002.76 → 3003.76] So there's always that.
[3003.76 → 3015.76] But when I was asked, I thought, looking back and just thinking about the past five years with him and just all the blessings that he's poured to us.
[3015.76 → 3020.76] And like Josh said, the big thing that really, really poured out was just determination.
[3020.76 → 3034.76] And it's whether it was sitting in the middle of youth and doing chair flips for whatever reason while Kevin was talking just so he could land the perfect one or just everything he puts 110% effort into.
[3034.76 → 3036.76] And we appreciate it immensely.
[3036.76 → 3041.76] Carson, today you're going to do your profession of faith in front of this wonderful congregation.
[3041.76 → 3043.76] And that's amazing.
[3043.76 → 3044.76] Super proud of you.
[3044.76 → 3045.76] Super happy.
[3045.76 → 3047.76] 桜, later, this ended up.
[3047.76 → 3057.76] But I do empower you to, as you go east to go to school, I empower you to keep this moment on the forefront of your mind.
[3057.76 → 3060.24] You are, you will be tested again.
[3060.24 → 3065.86] And I know you will be able to put 110% effort into it and you will succeed.
[3065.86 → 3075.76] So I just want to read the verse that has already been spoken of tonight, but it is Romans 10.9.
[3075.76 → 3078.98] one moment, that if you confess with your mouth
[3078.98 → 3082.58] that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead,
[3082.74 → 3086.66] you will be saved. So I just want you to remember that
[3086.66 → 3090.92] as you go forward, and I appreciate all the love, all the joy,
[3091.04 → 3094.76] all the laughs you've given us in the past five years and looking forward to carrying on
[3094.76 → 3095.34] our relationship.
[3102.02 → 3104.52] Yeah, Carson, you can stay, buddy. And I'm going to
[3104.52 → 3108.46] re-invite Ben and Haley and McKelvy. You guys can come forward as well.
[3108.90 → 3111.60] And Pastor Chris is here too, and he will lead us through the rest of this.
[3117.86 → 3122.10] All right. Why don't you guys, why don't you guys move down a little ways and then
[3122.10 → 3124.90] you guys can come over on this side here? We'll
[3124.90 → 3130.12] be mindful of framing up the shot at the back. There we go.
[3130.92 → 3134.12] I got the okay. We're good. Things you have to learn how to do,
[3134.12 → 3141.52] during these times. So there are a few Sundays a year that are my absolute favourites.
[3142.52 → 3145.76] As you can no doubt expect, Easter Sunday is one of them,
[3146.16 → 3151.76] and Profession of Faith Sunday, or Sundays, as the case may be, is another one.
[3151.76 → 3163.44] I love the testimony that is God's faithfulness to the life of the church that is represented by hearing stories like yours.
[3163.44 → 3172.92] Whether they are the absolute craziest stories of God turning life around, or they are the simple stories of God's faithfulness in the same direction.
[3174.84 → 3179.96] As a parent, I can tell you, I pray that my kids have that same story.
[3179.96 → 3189.40] And I'm blessed to stand here with you guys and to see God at work in this community and to hear from your spiritual mentors.
[3189.40 → 3191.80] So many years ago,
[3191.80 → 3195.86] at your baptism, whether that was in this church or another church,
[3195.86 → 3199.88] the community of faith promised to journey with you.
[3201.08 → 3204.26] Today marks a milestone on that journey.
[3205.36 → 3210.40] And so as part of our service, we will also promise to commit again to you and with you.
[3210.40 → 3213.28] And you promise committing to us.
[3213.28 → 3218.82] This is a beautiful testimony of God's faithfulness to his church.
[3219.74 → 3221.54] We're going to ask you guys a few questions.
[3221.70 → 3222.68] You've seen these questions.
[3222.82 → 3225.12] You've gone through them before in pastor's class.
[3225.20 → 3225.90] There's four of them.
[3226.48 → 3232.10] And then I will go down the line and ask you to respond as you are moved by the Spirit.
[3232.10 → 3234.06] I invite you to respond by saying,
[3234.20 → 3235.72] I do, God helping me.
[3237.00 → 3242.76] And so, Ben, Haley, Carson, and McKelvy.
[3243.28 → 3248.74] Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God sent to redeem the world?
[3249.38 → 3253.42] Do you love and trust him as the one who saves you from your sin?
[3254.14 → 3259.38] And do you with repentance and joy embrace him as the Lord of your life?
[3260.64 → 3265.56] Two, do you believe that the Bible is the word of God revealing Christ and his redemption
[3265.56 → 3270.62] and that the confessions of this church faithfully reflect this revelation?
[3270.62 → 3277.74] Three, do you accept the gracious promises of God sealed to you in your baptism?
[3278.08 → 3283.04] And do you affirm your union with Christ and his church, which your baptism signifies?
[3284.26 → 3290.56] And four, do you promise to do all that you can with the help of the Holy Spirit to strengthen
[3290.56 → 3296.04] your love and commitment to Christ by sharing faithfully in the life of the church, honouring
[3296.04 → 3297.58] and submitting to its authority?
[3297.58 → 3303.28] And do you join with the people of God in doing the work of the Lord everywhere?
[3304.72 → 3306.58] Ben, what is your answer?
[3310.90 → 3312.50] Haley, what is your answer?
[3313.12 → 3314.68] I do, God helping me.
[3316.18 → 3317.64] Carson, what is your answer?
[3318.36 → 3319.74] I do, God helping me.
[3320.94 → 3322.26] McKelvy, what is your answer?
[3322.26 → 3324.18] I do, God helping me.
[3325.46 → 3325.86] Amen.
[3328.10 → 3335.50] In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I now welcome you to all the privileges of full communion.
[3336.24 → 3339.88] I welcome you to full participation in the life of the church.
[3340.28 → 3344.50] I welcome you to its responsibilities, its joys, and its sufferings.
[3344.50 → 3349.80] May the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead,
[3349.92 → 3355.62] our Lord Jesus Christ, the great shepherd of the sheep, equip you with everything good
[3355.62 → 3357.42] for doing his will.
[3358.10 → 3364.50] And may he work in us what is pleasing to him through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever
[3364.50 → 3365.22] and ever.
[3366.08 → 3366.54] Amen.
[3366.54 → 3374.50] Church family, I'm going to invite you as you are able to stand.
[3374.60 → 3376.54] I'm going to ask you a question as well.
[3377.18 → 3381.62] I'm going to invite you to respond if you would in fact agree with the question by saying
[3381.62 → 3383.16] we do, God helping us.
[3383.32 → 3389.84] To those of you who are participating at home, please also respond in kind when we do.
[3389.84 → 3401.12] Do you, people of God, promise McKelvy, Carson, Haley, and Ben your love, encouragement, and prayers?
[3401.68 → 3402.40] What is your answer?
[3406.58 → 3407.22] Amen.
[3408.40 → 3409.26] You may be seated.
[3409.38 → 3409.74] Thank you.
[3411.32 → 3414.84] For what it's worth, take that seriously.
[3414.84 → 3422.16] They long, and we all together long, to encourage you, love you, support you, and pray for you.
[3422.54 → 3426.02] And so come what may, let us be on that journey of faith with you.
[3427.48 → 3431.18] I'm going to invite Elder Peter Nobleman to come forward.
[3431.34 → 3432.36] He has a gift for you.
[3433.80 → 3436.70] They are personally addressed, so find the right one.
[3436.86 → 3439.54] And then if you don't know who you're talking to, just say the name out loud.
[3439.54 → 3439.62] Amen.
[3444.84 → 3460.82] And then finally, we're going to pray over these people as they have made their profession of faith.
[3461.18 → 3467.04] And this week, again, like we did last week, we're going to do that a little bit differently.
[3467.04 → 3474.54] And so if you're part of the household bubble of each of these people, I'm going to invite you to come forward for the laying on of hands.
[3474.66 → 3478.64] And then for the rest of us, I'm just going to ask that you extend your hand out or hold your hand out.
[3478.68 → 3482.46] If you're at home, you can do the same as a mark of God's spirit working through you.
[3482.54 → 3486.90] And so I'm going to get you guys, since you're sort of bubbled together, to separate out so we have enough room.
[3487.68 → 3489.36] And then household bubbles, come on up.
[3490.04 → 3495.48] Household groups, whatever you discern that to be safe and wise.
[3495.48 → 3497.66] And then I'll invite the rest of you to stand.
[3498.00 → 3499.24] Thanks, Emo, for leading in that.
[3504.96 → 3506.32] So put a hand on a shoulder.
[3506.56 → 3511.54] If you can't reach, put a hand on the person who's behind with a hand on the shoulder.
[3512.54 → 3518.52] Extend your hands that we might offer God's blessing on this day.
[3525.48 → 3527.42] And so we bless them in this prayer.
[3530.00 → 3538.66] Lord, our God, we thank you for your word and spirit through which we know Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour.
[3538.66 → 3551.06] This morning, may Carson and McKelvy, Ben and Haley, having confessed your name, never cease to wonder at what you have done for them.
[3552.12 → 3560.44] Help them to continue firmly in the faith, to bear witness to your love, and to let the Holy Spirit shape their lives.
[3560.44 → 3567.52] Take them, good shepherd, into your care that they may loyally endure opposition in serving you.
[3568.82 → 3575.52] And may we, with all your children, live together in the joy and power of your Holy Spirit.
[3576.52 → 3581.54] We ask this, Lord Jesus, in the hope of your coming.
[3581.80 → 3583.54] Come quickly, we pray.
[3584.76 → 3585.12] Amen.
[3585.12 → 3585.28] Amen.
[3586.72 → 3587.28] Amen.
[3587.28 → 3587.34] Amen.
[3589.42 → 3590.66] Thank you all very much.
[3591.54 → 3593.14] You may wake your way back to your seat.
[3605.14 → 3605.62] Amen.
[3617.28 → 3619.28] Amen.
[3620.48 → 3621.14] Amen.
[3621.14 → 3621.92] Amen.
[3621.92 → 3622.18] Amen.
[3622.18 → 3623.30] Amen.
[3623.30 → 3623.76] Amen.
[3623.76 → 3625.54] Amen.
[3625.54 → 3625.60] God, amen.
[3625.60 → 3626.74] Amen.
[3627.08 → 3627.30] Amen.
[3627.48 → 3628.88] Amen.
[3632.88 → 3633.72] Amen.
[3633.72 → 3633.82] Amen.
[3633.82 → 3635.72] Amen.
[3635.74 → 3638.06] Amen.
[3638.06 → 3644.38] tablets
[3644.38 → 3647.78] I turn to heaven
[3647.78 → 3651.38] and start your feet
[3651.38 → 3655.38] into the sky
[3655.38 → 3659.38] And through the darkness
[3660.20 → 3663.38] your loving kindness
[3663.94 → 3667.36] tore through the shadows
[3667.36 → 3671.38] of my soul
[3671.38 → 3675.38] The world is finished
[3675.38 → 3679.38] The world is risen
[3679.38 → 3685.38] Jesus Christ, my dear
[3691.38 → 3697.38] The earth has made no mercy
[3697.38 → 3701.38] The world can't offer
[3701.38 → 3705.38] such boundless grace
[3705.38 → 3709.38] The world is risen
[3709.38 → 3713.38] The world of glory
[3713.38 → 3715.38] To wear my sin
[3715.38 → 3719.38] And wear my shame
[3719.38 → 3723.38] The gospel spoken
[3723.38 → 3725.38] I am forgiven
[3725.38 → 3727.38] I am forgiven
[3727.38 → 3731.38] The King of kings
[3731.38 → 3733.38] The King of kings
[3733.38 → 3735.38] The King of kings
[3735.38 → 3737.38] The King of kings
[3737.38 → 3739.38] The King of kings
[3739.38 → 3741.38] The King of kings
[3741.38 → 3743.38] The King of kings
[3743.38 → 3745.38] The King of kings
[3745.38 → 3747.38] The King of kings
[3747.38 → 3749.38] The King of kings
[3749.38 → 3751.38] The King of kings
[3751.38 → 3753.38] The King of kings
[3753.38 → 3755.38] And the king of kings
[3755.38 → 3756.38] The King of kings
[3756.38 → 3757.38] The King of kings
[3757.38 → 3758.38] The King of kings
[3758.38 → 3760.38] kings
[3760.38 → 3762.38] The King of kings
[3762.38 → 3764.38] The King of kings
[3764.38 → 3766.38] kings
[3766.38 → 3767.38] The King of kings
[3767.38 → 3768.38] The King of kings
[3768.38 → 3769.38] The King of kings
[3769.38 → 3774.38] kings
[3774.38 → 3775.38] The King of kings
[3775.38 → 3777.38] The King of kings
[3777.38 → 3778.38] kings
[3778.38 → 3779.38] the king of kings
[3779.38 → 3782.38] The King of kings
[3782.38 → 3783.38] The King of kings
[3783.38 → 3784.38] The King of kings
[3784.38 → 3789.14] is the one who set me free
[3789.14 → 3792.38] hallelujah
[3792.38 → 3796.38] death has lost its bread from me
[3796.38 → 3800.12] you have broken every chain
[3800.12 → 3803.76] there's salvation in your name
[3803.76 → 3805.92] Jesus Christ
[3805.92 → 3809.68] my living hope
[3814.38 → 3817.54] then came the morning
[3817.54 → 3821.76] that sealed the promise
[3821.76 → 3824.96] that the very morning
[3824.96 → 3828.72] began to breathe
[3828.72 → 3833.36] the silence
[3833.36 → 3835.26] the glory
[3835.26 → 3836.36] the glory
[3836.36 → 3838.12] the glory
[3838.12 → 3841.62] has no pain
[3841.62 → 3846.62] the glory
[3846.62 → 3847.62] the glory
[3847.62 → 3850.62] has no promise
[3850.62 → 3852.62] the glory
[3852.62 → 3854.62] the glory
[3854.62 → 3858.62] began to breathe
[3858.62 → 3860.62] the glory
[3860.62 → 3862.62] the glory
[3862.62 → 3864.62] the glory
[3864.62 → 3869.62] the glory
[3869.62 → 3871.62] the glory
[3871.62 → 3873.62] the glory
[3873.62 → 3874.12] the glory
[3874.62 → 3875.62] Jesus
[3875.62 → 3876.62] yours
[3876.62 → 3878.62] is the victory
[3878.62 → 3880.62] Oh
[3908.62 → 3910.62] Oh
[3910.62 → 3912.62] Oh
[3912.62 → 3914.62] Hallelujah
[3914.62 → 3918.62] He's the one who sent him free
[3918.62 → 3920.62] Hallelujah
[3920.62 → 3922.62] Hallelujah
[3922.62 → 3926.62] Death has lost its grip on me
[3926.62 → 3930.62] You have broken every chain
[3930.62 → 3934.62] There's salvation in your name
[3934.62 → 3936.62] Jesus Christ
[3936.62 → 3938.62] My living
[3938.62 → 3940.62] home
[3940.62 → 3942.62] Jesus Christ
[3942.62 → 3944.62] My living
[3944.62 → 3946.62] home
[3946.62 → 3948.62] Oh
[3948.62 → 3950.62] God you are
[3950.62 → 3952.62] My living
[3952.62 → 3954.62] home
[3954.62 → 3958.62] I invite you to be seated.
[3964.62 → 3966.62] Yes
[3966.62 → 3968.62] Once again
[3968.62 → 3970.62] I
[3970.62 → 3972.62] have
[3972.62 → 3974.62] a
[3974.62 → 3976.62] meeting
[3976.62 → 3978.62] of
[3978.62 → 3980.62] the
[3980.62 → 3982.62] meeting
[3982.62 → 3984.62] of
[3984.62 → 3986.62] the
[3986.62 → 3988.62] meeting
[3988.62 → 3990.62] of
[3990.62 → 3992.62] the
[3992.62 → 3993.62] meeting
[3993.62 → 3995.62] Yes
[3995.62 → 3997.62] Once again
[3997.62 → 3999.62] I'm thankful to God that I could witness the testimony of these
[3999.62 → 4001.62] four young Christians
[4001.62 → 4007.62] and I pray that the Holy Spirit will lead and guide them to great things for the Lord in the future.
[4023.62 → 4033.62] A
[4033.62 → 4035.62] Those to us who live in the future are for these days to say about Christ.
[4035.62 → 4039.62] Give us the opportunity to prepare a given Saturday.
[4039.62 → 4041.62] David
[4041.62 → 4054.88] They begin to demonstrate God's forgiveness and reach out in love even to their oppressors.
[4054.88 → 4060.60] One of the greatest challenges to Christians living under oppression is isolation from
[4060.60 → 4064.70] God's Word and from the body of Christ.
[4064.70 → 4071.60] In 1 Corinthians 12 verse 26 it says, if one member suffers, all suffer together.
[4071.60 → 4075.56] If one member is honoured, all rejoice together.
[4075.56 → 4082.10] Open Doors empowers persecuted Christians by supplying Bibles and Christian literature,
[4082.10 → 4090.32] training Christian leaders, facilitating social and economic projects, and uniting believers
[4090.32 → 4096.72] in the West in prayer for Christians who are the most persecuted religious group in the
[4096.72 → 4102.82] world and are oppressed in at least 70 countries.
[4102.82 → 4109.70] Please give generously and pray for our brothers and sisters who are persecuted for Jesus' sake.
[4109.70 → 4114.48] Next week's offering is for the church budget and Calvin Seminary.
[4114.48 → 4118.72] Calvin Seminary is the official seminary for the Christian Reformed denomination.
[4118.72 → 4119.78] Thank you.
[4119.78 → 4119.80] Thank you.
[4119.80 → 4120.30] Thank you.
[4139.26 → 4143.22] Let's come together in our church, family, and congregational prayer.
[4143.22 → 4151.84] Holy Father, it is hot.
[4152.04 → 4153.00] It's a hot day today.
[4154.70 → 4161.24] And we are especially thinking about those today as it just gets hotter today and tomorrow.
[4162.86 → 4164.20] About those who struggle.
[4164.20 → 4171.56] We often read in several years that there's always some who struggle, whether it be in the cold
[4171.56 → 4173.66] of the winter or in the heat of the summer.
[4174.60 → 4182.22] And as we look towards probably some record-breaking temperatures, Lord, that you protect those who
[4182.22 → 4185.16] are especially vulnerable because of this.
[4185.16 → 4193.36] And also just help everyone to be able to overcome and get through this heat.
[4196.24 → 4201.30] Lord, we are thankful today for Dismay.
[4201.64 → 4208.36] Thankful that she is able to return to a bit of a life a bit more normal back home with her family,
[4208.52 → 4209.58] recovering from surgery.
[4210.38 → 4211.60] We're thankful for that.
[4211.60 → 4219.62] And Lord, we also pray for Maria as she is recovering from her surgery as well.
[4219.90 → 4220.92] And pray for healing there.
[4222.58 → 4228.32] Lord, we know that Bob is diagnosed now with lymphoma.
[4229.30 → 4236.06] And he is now going through treatments and feeling some of the side effects of that, Lord.
[4236.06 → 4243.74] Lord, be with him, keep him strength, and also give him strength from those around him to support him.
[4245.32 → 4252.86] Lord, we think of our neighbours just a few houses down the road here who had an unexpected fire
[4252.86 → 4256.52] that has affected two houses.
[4257.64 → 4260.48] And we could see them on the way to church today.
[4260.48 → 4265.48] Lord, be with those families here in our neighbourhood.
[4266.40 → 4272.26] I already know that the community has surrounded them with GoFundMe campaigns and raising money for them to help them,
[4272.34 → 4277.72] which is great to see, Lord, and help us also to pray and support them in our neighbourhood as much as we can here.
[4279.94 → 4285.70] Lord, thank you again for the blessing of Profession of Faith.
[4285.70 → 4290.54] We saw the young people here today as well as last week.
[4290.90 → 4298.02] We're thankful for those who come up, stand in front here of your church and in front of you.
[4298.26 → 4301.36] And it is not an easy thing to do just to be in front of people,
[4301.80 → 4306.38] but thankful that they have that strength, and they have summoned that from you, Lord,
[4306.48 → 4307.80] to come up here and say,
[4308.40 → 4311.58] I am living my life for Jesus Christ.
[4311.58 → 4315.30] And are asking the church to walk beside them.
[4315.40 → 4318.46] And the church committing that is a beautiful thing.
[4319.84 → 4322.22] Lord, as we've mentioned here today,
[4322.32 → 4329.88] we're looking forward to an announcement coming this week about the easing of COVID-19 restrictions, Lord.
[4330.72 → 4334.14] Thank you for the communication from the health officer.
[4334.62 → 4340.14] We look forward to being here in bigger numbers and worshipping together.
[4340.14 → 4343.42] And hopefully there are more changes around what that looks like too, Lord.
[4344.88 → 4349.20] We, as a church, long to be a community together.
[4349.38 → 4351.68] And that includes worshipping here together in person.
[4352.22 → 4357.54] And Lord, we look forward to being brought here again together to worship you, Lord,
[4357.62 → 4364.24] as we see restrictions ease and maybe even a state of emergency lifted as well, Lord.
[4364.36 → 4365.10] Thank you for that.
[4365.10 → 4368.06] Be with us as we go on through this day.
[4368.20 → 4370.76] Be with Kevin as he delivers your word to us, Lord.
[4371.34 → 4373.56] Give him strength again in this heat.
[4374.20 → 4383.84] And as well, be with us as we listen and be mindful of what we hear and apply that to our day and our life.
[4384.24 → 4385.08] In Jesus' name we pray.
[4385.62 → 4385.86] Amen.
[4385.86 → 4385.94] Amen.
[4385.94 → 4385.96] Amen.
[4385.96 → 4385.98] Amen.
[4385.98 → 4386.00] Amen.
[4386.00 → 4386.04] Amen.
[4395.10 → 4410.50] Amen.
[4410.74 → 4413.18] Amen.
[4416.00 → 4418.08] And we're going to say amen.
[4418.08 → 4420.74] Thank you for thecal.
[4420.80 → 4421.14] Amen.
[4422.14 → 4422.82] Thank you.
[4422.82 → 4423.28] Amen.
[4423.28 → 4424.92] Amen.
[4424.92 → 4430.16] that right now it is 10.06, and we are an hour and six minutes into this service and I want you all
[4430.16 → 4434.96] to know that my service will reflect that. I knew that we were doing Professions of Faith today. I
[4434.96 → 4438.80] knew that it was going to be hot. So you're going to be hearing this passage. I'll provide a little
[4438.80 → 4444.02] context, and you're getting just a one-pointer today. So that's happening. Just be ready. But
[4444.02 → 4449.22] even though it's a shorter sermon and there's only one point, it's a good point. So like just be
[4449.22 → 4455.06] excited about that. Spoiler alert, it's about grace. So be ready. Thirdly, not only is my sermon
[4455.06 → 4460.22] short, but I am wearing shorts because I thought that should reflect, there should be symmetry there.
[4460.96 → 4464.56] It's 40 degrees today. The idea that pastors need to wear pants when they're standing in front of a
[4464.56 → 4469.46] church to preach, that rule goes away at about 32 degrees, let alone 42. So I made the switch,
[4469.80 → 4474.02] but I did talk to the camera people. You're getting a waist up shot at home, so you won't even notice.
[4474.02 → 4478.08] So don't worry about it. And those of you here, please just make like intense eye contact and
[4478.08 → 4485.80] then you won't notice either. So I'm also wearing sandals today because WWJD. So that's enough
[4485.80 → 4494.10] preamble. Today we're going to look at an awesome, yet a very confusing story about Jesus and a
[4494.10 → 4500.82] Syrophoenician woman. Now that's pronounced Syrophoenician, not Syrophoenician. I've been
[4500.82 → 4506.30] practicing. So this story is found in Mark 7, verse 24 to 30. So please, if you've got your Bibles with
[4506.30 → 4511.14] you here, if you are at home, please open up your Bibles, snuggle in at home to this text. If you're
[4511.14 → 4514.00] here, your Bibles, your phone is good. Sit up nice and straight. It's good for your back.
[4514.84 → 4518.70] And read with me this story. Mark 7, 24 to 30 says,
[4519.30 → 4526.70] Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone
[4526.70 → 4532.94] to know it. Yet he could not keep his presence secret. In fact, as soon as she heard about him,
[4532.94 → 4539.36] a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an impure spirit came and fell at his feet. The
[4539.36 → 4545.72] woman was a Greek born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter.
[4546.78 → 4551.22] First, let the children eat all they want, he told her, for it is not right to take the children's
[4551.22 → 4559.14] bread and toss it to the dogs. Lord, she replied, even the dogs under the table eat the children's
[4559.14 → 4565.90] crumbs. Then he told her, for such a reply you may go, the demon has left your daughter. She went home
[4565.90 → 4571.80] and found her child lying on the bed and the demon gone. The word of the Lord.
[4573.62 → 4578.84] Now, as always, a little bit of context here will provide a bit of clarity to a confusing exchange
[4578.84 → 4585.38] between Jesus and this woman. We will come to realize that grace is at the centre of this story
[4585.38 → 4590.28] and that grace, more than anything, is at the foundation of your stories as well.
[4591.26 → 4595.72] But as I said, in order to see that, we need to do a little digging first. So, let's tackle the where
[4595.72 → 4601.94] of this passage because Mark is very specific about where this takes place. In the NIV, he says,
[4602.14 → 4606.86] they left where they were, and they went to the vicinity of Tyre. In other translations,
[4607.42 → 4613.00] it says Tyre and Simon. Now, this is important because this is the first and only time in Mark's
[4613.00 → 4621.14] Gospel that Jesus leaves Jewish territory and enters Gentile territory. They enter Gentile
[4621.14 → 4628.08] land, Tyre and Simon, and likely this Mediterranean little seaport city of Phoenicia. And as with
[4628.08 → 4635.82] everything, Jesus enters this Gentile territory for a reason. Now, leading up to this moment in Scripture,
[4635.82 → 4645.58] Jesus has just spent the last sort of two stories in Mark 7 reframing Jewish thought. So, in the first
[4645.58 → 4650.98] 13 verses of Mark 7, and feel free to check that out, Jesus sort of chats it up with the Pharisees
[4650.98 → 4657.90] and he condemns them for putting their traditions ahead of what, in fact, the Word of the Lord says.
[4658.14 → 4664.36] And he follows that story up right before this one, and he challenges Jewish purity laws.
[4664.36 → 4669.04] Essentially, Jesus teaches them that it's not what goes into them that defiles them,
[4669.94 → 4675.14] but what comes out of them. And he was challenging, like I said, the purity laws, that the food,
[4675.30 → 4681.00] the food story that they defined as clean and unclean and saying it's not what you eat,
[4682.00 → 4689.52] but how you respond to temptation that leads to pure or unclean hearts. And so, this text today,
[4689.58 → 4693.48] it makes the most sense if we read it from the perspective of the disciples coming from that
[4693.48 → 4699.98] context. Jesus just rocked their world, talking about what makes someone clean. And now he's in
[4699.98 → 4705.66] Gentile territory, a place filled with unclean people according to the standard Jewish view,
[4705.96 → 4712.14] and Jesus ends up speaking to this woman. And again, much like the location of the story,
[4712.88 → 4719.34] Mark really wants his readers to understand who this woman is. She's not Jewish, but she's Greek.
[4719.34 → 4725.84] She's a Gentile by both culture and by region. And in its parallel story, this story is also found
[4725.84 → 4733.94] in Matthew 15. She is referred to there as the Canaanite woman. So, Jesus is in a Gentile land,
[4734.18 → 4739.84] and he's interrupted by a Canaanite woman. This woman whose forefathers were enemies of God in
[4739.84 → 4746.04] the Jewish people. But she comes to Jesus, and she asks him to cast out a demon that has possessed
[4746.04 → 4752.06] her little daughter. Now again, we'll just quickly recap that conversation. Verse 27 and 28 of our text
[4752.06 → 4759.18] says, first let the children eat all they want, for it's not right to take the children's bread and
[4759.18 → 4766.64] toss it to the dogs. Lord, she replied, even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.
[4768.66 → 4775.90] Now this conversation is a bit crazy, and Jesus' response here even seems harsh. It seems like he
[4775.90 → 4781.62] is insulting her by calling her a dog and says that she is less important than the disciples that are
[4781.62 → 4788.08] there in front of him. Who are there to learn from him? But that doesn't make sense. Jesus wouldn't
[4788.08 → 4793.86] insult her, right? Why does this conversation seem to run counter to different stories in scripture of
[4793.86 → 4800.16] Jesus, like the woman at the well, for example, or the parable of the Good Samaritan? Because the
[4800.16 → 4805.22] answer to this is in the tone of this conversation. Now again, there are a couple of things that are really
[4805.22 → 4809.74] important about this conversation that will help bring some understanding here. First,
[4809.74 → 4816.58] Jesus was aware of this woman's faith, and Jesus, he knew what was going to happen. His response,
[4817.14 → 4823.14] it seems standoffish here, but it's actually something quite different. So Jesus is using
[4823.14 → 4829.14] something called piratic irony here, and if you don't know what that is, I didn't either until a few
[4829.14 → 4836.44] days ago, and I minored in English like a decade ago. But essentially, piratic irony is a mode of
[4836.44 → 4842.64] communication that invites dialogue in order to affirm or sort of cement someone's belief or stance
[4842.64 → 4848.50] in something. So in some ways, Jesus is testing this woman, but more accurately, he's giving her a chance
[4848.50 → 4855.46] to show her faith to those around him. It's a tongue-in-cheek conversation here. Picture Jesus
[4855.46 → 4861.60] winking as he's saying it, for example. Now there are other types of dialogue in the Bible that we can use
[4861.60 → 4868.74] as examples of this. Genesis 19 verse 2, the angels take the same approach to Lot before they save him,
[4868.90 → 4873.70] and they give him an opportunity to show his faith to them. Jesus does this later on with Peter in John
[4873.70 → 4879.80] 21, when he asks Peter if he loves him three times over. Jesus knew there was a teaching moment. There's a
[4879.80 → 4886.32] little bit more to that one as well, but piratic irony exists there. So it's a tongue-in-cheek
[4886.32 → 4893.14] conversation with this woman. And second of all, while it comes across as an insult, Jesus uses the
[4893.14 → 4900.08] word dog here very cleverly. Now to the Jews, or those 12 disciples that are in front of him,
[4900.66 → 4905.52] the word dog would have been associated to them as this derogatory term for a Gentile.
[4906.56 → 4914.34] We can read an example of that in Revelation 22 verse 15. But this woman would not hear an insult
[4914.34 → 4920.06] there because she wasn't Jewish. Again, in her eyes, this wasn't an insult. This was an invitation.
[4920.70 → 4927.02] This was an invitation to a dialogue. And so with one question, Jesus uses languages that, or language,
[4927.14 → 4933.08] sorry, that his disciples would understand meaning one thing, but this woman another. And it allows this
[4933.08 → 4941.32] woman to respond in a way which once again would redefine how Jesus is teaching these people how God's
[4941.32 → 4947.24] kingdom will come. And the woman's response is brilliant. She points out that even the family
[4947.24 → 4953.68] dog gets to eat the crumbs that fall from the table. So sadly, and it's a true story here, we
[4953.68 → 4958.62] lowbrows actually lost our family dog this week. On Wednesday, our dog Kona died, and it was a little
[4958.62 → 4963.32] bit tragic. But one thing that's become abundantly clear to me in those few days since Kona's passing
[4963.32 → 4970.54] is how clean he kept our kitchen floor. It is amazing how many crumbs fall to the floor when my
[4970.54 → 4975.60] three kids sit down to eat dinner. And Kona would just hoover them up faster than the Roomba 5,000.
[4975.68 → 4983.30] Like, it was crazy. The point is, while the children eat, there's always some food for the dogs, right?
[4984.86 → 4990.54] While Jesus shows grace to the Jews, there's always more grace for the Gentiles, right?
[4990.54 → 4999.84] The grace of God knows no bounds. And this woman knew that. With everything that Jesus was teaching
[4999.84 → 5004.72] his disciples leading up to this moment about their traditions, about the purity laws, and about
[5004.72 → 5011.50] how Jesus is transforming all of it, this conversation with this Syrophoenician woman is the rubber stamp to
[5011.50 → 5018.30] seal it all. God's grace is limitless. And the Syrophoenician woman knew that.
[5020.54 → 5025.24] Did you know that this is the only miracle in the entire book of Mark that Jesus performs from a
[5025.24 → 5030.78] distance? He didn't have to go to this woman's house or visit this woman's daughter. He just said
[5030.78 → 5037.66] to her in that spot far away, he said, you may go. The demon has left your daughter. And yet the real
[5037.66 → 5047.44] miracle isn't that Jesus can heal people from a distance, but that God's grace overcomes all
[5047.44 → 5054.74] prejudices and boundaries. So not only is God's grace greater than prejudices like race or social
[5054.74 → 5061.14] class or education level or proximity to God, or in the case of this Syrophoenician woman, all the
[5061.14 → 5070.84] above. God's grace is greater than any boundary that you can think of. This means there is no person either
[5070.84 → 5077.52] unqualified. There is no sin too great. There is, in fact, no faith too small
[5077.52 → 5087.32] to receive the abundance of grace that comes from Christ Jesus. Grace even precedes faith.
[5088.92 → 5094.86] In fact, it is God's grace that is the foundation on which our faith sprouts and is built.
[5094.86 → 5101.72] God doesn't require faith to show grace. If he did, it wouldn't be grace. Grace can't be coerced
[5101.72 → 5107.88] out of God. Grace, it isn't transactional. God doesn't require anything from you to grant grace.
[5107.94 → 5113.74] If he did, we wouldn't call grace a gift. We'd all call it an incentive to believe. And that's not
[5113.74 → 5120.84] grace. That's never how grace is discussed in Scripture. Christ never dangled grace out like a
[5120.84 → 5128.36] carrot in front of a donkey saying, if you believe, you can have this. No. Grace abounds from God because
[5128.36 → 5136.84] God is the God of love. God is the God of mercy. God is the God of grace. And that's what makes grace
[5136.84 → 5144.28] so amazing because it is unabashedly, undeservingly, and unmistakably free.
[5144.28 → 5152.96] God sent his son to live the life that we all fail to live. And he died the death that all of us
[5152.96 → 5160.08] deserve to die. But he rose again from the grave, defeating sin and death and providing grace for all
[5160.08 → 5166.92] humanity. Grace that has no stipulation except that it cost Christ his life.
[5166.92 → 5175.86] grace came first. Faith sprouts from it. People turn to God, not so that they will eventually receive
[5175.86 → 5183.14] grace for what they have done, but because they realize they have already received God's grace.
[5185.14 → 5190.66] The Syrophoenician woman understood this. She knew there were crumbs for her to eat because God's grace
[5190.66 → 5196.24] was not dependent on her being Jewish or Jesus being present in her house or even if she believed.
[5196.92 → 5203.06] But that grace from the Lord was available because grace comes first.
[5204.90 → 5210.58] Even today, with these four lovely professions of faith that we heard, we recognize that it isn't
[5210.58 → 5215.06] necessarily their faithfulness that we're celebrating, even though we can, and even though these are four
[5215.06 → 5222.96] amazing people. It is God's faithfulness to them, which is emphasized by his grace. Grace that existed
[5222.96 → 5229.32] before they even know it, which is what their testimonies today reflected. That is what we can celebrate.
[5229.32 → 5239.00] The Jewish people had a hard time with Jesus. They didn't understand this abundance of grace that
[5239.00 → 5243.94] Jesus poured out for everyone. They would not eat the spiritual food that Jesus had spread out so
[5243.94 → 5251.44] abundantly for them. But this woman knew that Jesus could save. They expected him to be gracious to her
[5251.44 → 5257.10] because she knew his grace. All she needed was a crumb.
[5259.50 → 5265.22] That is the point for today. We must recognize that we have no claim on Christ's grace,
[5265.22 → 5273.42] but we can expect him to be gracious in all circumstances because that's who he is.
[5273.42 → 5281.60] Only when we truly understand the endless supply, the boundless measure, the extreme magnitude of his
[5281.60 → 5287.90] grace, and we recognize that God's grace is the foundation that even our own faith sprouts from,
[5288.90 → 5295.82] then we will start to know him more, understand him more, and start to be transformed by him more.
[5295.82 → 5305.02] There is no sin in your life that is greater than grace. We are all set free. Give it to Christ. He
[5305.02 → 5311.72] can bear it. Your chains are gone. You've been set free from your sin. Your God, your Saviour,
[5311.86 → 5321.86] has ransomed you like a flood. His mercy reigns because he has unending love and amazing grace. Amen. Let me pray.
[5321.86 → 5332.62] Father God, this gift of grace is incredible. It is something that we perhaps are guilty of putting
[5332.62 → 5339.66] boundaries on, thinking perhaps there are things we have done that are not deserving of it. And Lord,
[5339.74 → 5346.36] while we are undeserving of your grace, it is there for us. You have granted it. Your son came,
[5346.36 → 5353.78] he lived, he died, he rose again. His grace abounds for all. May we truly understand the magnitude of
[5353.78 → 5361.26] grace that exists for all of us, and that we only need a crumb. And so God, as we leave this place, we go out
[5361.26 → 5368.06] into our weeks, into our summers, into our jobs, our schools, into whatever our life brings us.
[5369.00 → 5374.58] May we be able to proclaim the truth of this grace that exists for all people, because that is the hope that
[5374.58 → 5378.30] so many people need. We pray this in your son's name. Amen.
[5404.58 → 5405.58] Amen.
[5405.58 → 5406.58] Thank you.
[5406.58 → 5407.58] Amen.
[5407.58 → 5408.58] Amen.
[5408.58 → 5409.58] Amen.
[5409.58 → 5414.58] We pray this in his name.
[5414.58 → 5415.58] Amen.
[5415.58 → 5416.58] Amen.
[5416.58 → 5417.58] Amen.
[5417.58 → 5418.58] Amen.
[5418.58 → 5423.32] Amen.
[5423.32 → 5424.20] Amen.
