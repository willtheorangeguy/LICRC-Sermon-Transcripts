[1399.38 --> 1403.42]  Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous deeds among the peoples.
[1404.12 --> 1406.74]  For great is the Lord and most worthy of praise.
[1407.04 --> 1409.38]  He is to be feared above all gods.
[1409.98 --> 1414.16]  For all the gods of the nations are idols, but the Lord made the heavens.
[1414.72 --> 1416.70]  Splendor and majesty are before him.
[1417.06 --> 1419.08]  Strength and glory are in his sanctuary.

[1438.76 --> 1441.10]  Say among the nations, the Lord reigns.
[1441.66 --> 1443.40]  The world is firmly established.
[1443.76 --> 1445.00]  It cannot be moved.
[1445.34 --> 1447.74]  He will judge the peoples with equity.
[1447.74 --> 1450.32]  Let the heavens rejoice.
[1450.72 --> 1451.80]  Let the earth be glad.
[1452.30 --> 1454.88]  Let the sea resound and all that is in it.
[1455.38 --> 1457.96]  Let the fields be jubilant and everything in them.
[1458.30 --> 1461.02]  Let all the trees of the forest sing for joy.
[1461.54 --> 1465.14]  Let all creation rejoice before the Lord, for he comes.
[1465.48 --> 1467.00]  He comes to judge the earth.
[1467.40 --> 1471.48]  He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples in his faithfulness.
[1471.48 --> 1477.70]  Let's take some time to pray together in our worship.
[1477.70 --> 1487.14]  Thank you, Lord God, for the opportunity of worship.
[1487.86 --> 1492.16]  For the freedom to sing your praises at will.
[1492.16 --> 1500.56]  Thank you that in worship we can put aside the uncertainties of this world
[1500.56 --> 1504.30]  and rest upon the certainties of the kingdom.
[1505.30 --> 1510.68]  For your promises are not changeable as those of any man or woman might be,
[1511.46 --> 1514.10]  but they are immovable and eternal.
[1514.10 --> 1524.56]  Holy Father, we gather in your presence tonight.
[1526.50 --> 1529.06]  We gather as those who long to sing your praises.
[1529.24 --> 1532.60]  We gather as those who long to meet you in our worship.
[1532.74 --> 1536.12]  And so, Holy Spirit, move in power.
[1538.16 --> 1540.78]  Move in us each tonight.
[1540.78 --> 1547.92]  Wherever we are in this place or far afield, we pray, move in power.
[1550.98 --> 1558.56]  Father God, as we worship, I hear you speaking to us in the words of the prophet Joel.
[1560.36 --> 1563.18]  Spirit, I hear you say, even now, declares the Lord,
[1563.30 --> 1567.46]  return to me with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning.
[1567.46 --> 1571.02]  Rend your heart and not your garments.
[1572.50 --> 1576.42]  Return to the Lord your God, for he is gracious and compassionate,
[1576.64 --> 1579.92]  slow to anger and abounding in love.
[1582.02 --> 1586.34]  Father God, tonight may we know your abounding love.
[1586.34 --> 1596.86]  And in the security of your love and presence, convict us of your truth.
[1598.32 --> 1605.54]  May we genuinely, deeply, authentically rend our hearts.
[1607.54 --> 1614.02]  Tear open the dark places of our soul and expose them to your light.
[1614.02 --> 1619.62]  Peer into the depths of our darkness.
[1621.16 --> 1625.56]  And try us and know us intimately.
[1629.16 --> 1634.16]  God, tonight may we open ourselves up to you.
[1634.16 --> 1641.08]  May we feel you at work in us and through us.
[1641.22 --> 1644.80]  And may we see you at work in the world, in your power.
[1645.50 --> 1648.10]  We rend our hearts in the name of Jesus.
[1653.10 --> 1659.66]  We rend our hearts to see you here now.
[1659.66 --> 1687.40]  Holy Father, we thank you for the changes that are happening around us in the world,
[1687.40 --> 1697.42]  especially as we see the COVID pandemic being pushed back and being beaten by our restart efforts and plans.
[1697.50 --> 1701.92]  And we praise your name for your work in accomplishing your will.
[1701.92 --> 1710.46]  And even as we give you thanks, Lord God, we pray that you would use us to fulfill your will and your work in the world.
[1710.46 --> 1718.06]  And so, Lord God, we pray the church of Jesus Christ, praise, crying out, calling out,
[1718.38 --> 1728.52]  end this pandemic, end our loneliness, end our isolation, end our crying and our mourning as we call out to you, Lord Jesus.
[1728.52 --> 1738.46]  Take our broken hearts and make us whole.
[1742.96 --> 1746.58]  May we know, Lord God, as you say in the prophet Malachi,
[1746.58 --> 1776.56]  may we know that you hold all the way to the Lord,
[1776.56 --> 1782.52]  all history in your hands and it is by the prayers of your saints that you move in the world.
[1782.66 --> 1784.14]  And so we pray.
[1785.88 --> 1787.34]  We rend our hearts
[1787.34 --> 1789.40]  and we worship.
[1791.40 --> 1792.88]  We give you thanks
[1792.88 --> 1794.74]  for this chance
[1794.74 --> 1796.56]  to be here
[1796.56 --> 1798.66]  together in your

[1800.56 --> 1802.88]  singing your praise.
[1802.88 --> 1814.32]  Thank you
[1814.32 --> 1818.42]  that as we draw near in worship,
[1819.42 --> 1821.40]  we are transported
[1821.40 --> 1823.30]  from a world
[1823.30 --> 1825.06]  of concerns
[1825.06 --> 1826.18]  and fears
[1826.18 --> 1829.56]  to a place
[1829.56 --> 1832.30]  where we can be at peace
[1832.30 --> 1834.22]  in your presence,

[1845.18 --> 1846.52]  for the opportunity
[1846.52 --> 1848.68]  of worship.

[2139.60 --> 2142.98]  Till from heaven you came running
[2142.98 --> 2146.80]  There was mercy in your eyes
[2146.80 --> 2150.38]  To fulfill the love and promise

[2292.58 --> 2306.18]  When the church of Christ was born, and the Spirit lit the flame, now this gospel truth of old shall not be, shall not be.
