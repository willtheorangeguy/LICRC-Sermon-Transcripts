[0.00 → 29.00] I can't resurrect
[29.00 → 32.00] a man with my own hands.
[32.00 → 37.00] But just the mention of your name
[37.00 → 39.00] can raise the dead.
[39.00 → 46.00] All the glory to the only one who can.
[46.00 → 49.00] Jesus is yours.
[49.00 → 53.00] Jesus is yours.
[53.00 → 58.00] Oh, I believe the wonder work in God.
[58.00 → 60.00] Yes, you are.
[60.00 → 62.00] The wonder work in God.
[62.00 → 65.00] All the miracles I've seen.
[65.00 → 68.00] Too good to not believe.
[68.00 → 72.00] You're the wonder work in God.
[72.00 → 75.00] You heal because you love.
[75.00 → 78.00] All the miracles we'll see.
[78.00 → 81.00] You're too good to not believe.
[81.00 → 84.00] Too good to not believe.
[84.00 → 85.00] Come on.
[85.00 → 87.00] Too good to not believe.
[87.00 → 91.00] After everything I've seen.
[91.00 → 95.00] Too good to not believe.
[95.00 → 99.00] Too good to not believe.
[99.00 → 101.00] Too good to not believe.
[101.00 → 102.00] Too good to not believe.
[102.00 → 104.00] Too good to not believe.
[104.00 → 106.00] Too good to not believe.
[106.00 → 107.00] For anything I've seen you do.
[107.00 → 108.00] Oh God.
[108.00 → 110.00] Yes, I believe.
[110.00 → 112.00] I believe, I believe it.
[112.00 → 115.00] Oh, I believe.
[115.00 → 115.72] I believe.
[120.18 → 123.16] We've seen cancer disappear.
[123.88 → 126.84] We've seen broken bodies heal.
[127.38 → 130.48] Don't you tell me he can't do it.
[130.76 → 133.76] Don't you tell me he can't do it.
[134.06 → 136.78] We've seen real life resurrection.
[137.46 → 140.24] We've seen mental health restored.
[140.74 → 143.80] Don't you tell me he can't do it.
[143.80 → 147.14] Don't you tell me he can't do it.
[147.28 → 150.20] We've seen families reunited.
[150.56 → 153.40] We've seen prodigals return.
[153.58 → 157.04] Don't you tell me he can't do it.
[157.40 → 160.38] Don't you tell me he can't do it.
[160.58 → 163.46] We've seen troubled souls delivered.
[164.08 → 166.76] We've seen addicts finally free.
[166.76 → 170.44] Don't you tell me he can't do it.
[170.44 → 173.78] Don't you tell me he can't do it.
[173.78 → 177.00] We'll see cities here revival.
[177.50 → 180.16] Salvation flood the street.
[180.32 → 180.70] Come on.
[180.74 → 183.70] Don't you tell me he can't do it.
[183.96 → 187.04] Don't you tell me he can't do it.
[187.30 → 190.46] We'll see glory fill the nations.
[190.84 → 193.50] Like the world has never seen.
[193.92 → 197.18] Don't you tell me he can't do it.
[197.18 → 200.52] Because I know that he can't do it.
[200.52 → 202.52] Yes, I believe.
[202.52 → 205.36] You're the wonder-working God.
[205.36 → 208.68] You're the wonder-working God.
[209.18 → 212.14] All the miracles I've seen.
[212.52 → 215.02] Two girls and I believe.
[215.02 → 218.78] You're the wonder-working God.
[218.78 → 222.12] And you heal because you love.
[222.12 → 225.42] For the miracles we'll see.
[225.74 → 228.46] Two girls and I believe.
[229.16 → 231.70] Two girls and I believe.
[232.46 → 234.34] Two girls and I believe.
[234.34 → 236.12] Oh, I'll never stop believing.
[236.88 → 238.04] Oh, yes, I believe.
[238.18 → 239.30] We've seen so much.
[239.32 → 240.22] Yes, I believe.
[240.78 → 242.20] You're the same yesterday.
[242.90 → 243.46] Today.
[243.96 → 244.58] Come forever.
[244.58 → 246.12] Oh, girl, I'll never stop believing.
[246.12 → 248.24] You can do anything, Jesus.
[249.04 → 250.12] You can do anything.
[250.40 → 250.96] I believe.
[251.96 → 252.66] I believe.
[253.66 → 255.54] Wonder-working God.
[256.58 → 258.66] Wonder-working God.
[259.68 → 261.84] Don't you ever stop believing.
[262.96 → 265.16] Because he's so, so good.
[266.38 → 268.52] So, so good.
[276.12 → 293.38] Peace like a river.
[293.38 → 295.96] Wash over me.
[300.96 → 303.08] Immerse me in water.
[303.08 → 305.54] As deep as the sea.
[310.92 → 312.76] Hide me in love.
[313.30 → 315.56] Healing embrace.
[318.06 → 320.02] Peace like a river.
[322.92 → 324.72] Wash over me.
[327.72 → 332.12] Good morning and welcome to worship.
[332.12 → 335.14] We are excited to gather together this morning.
[335.24 → 340.98] We are excited to gather with those of us who are here in the building for this service
[340.98 → 344.18] and those of you who are joining us online.
[344.30 → 348.86] It's our hope and prayer that in this hour of worship together, we will see the face of
[348.86 → 353.76] Jesus and our affections for him will be stirred as we worship our God.
[354.18 → 359.94] This morning we are installing new office bearers, and we are really excited to see God at work
[359.94 → 361.90] in our church through that process.
[362.62 → 367.58] We invite you to be part of that later on in our service.
[367.58 → 370.88] Before we begin in earnest, just a few announcements.
[372.04 → 378.58] First, you have no doubt heard by now of the food drive that's happening on June 12th.
[379.30 → 380.66] That's next weekend.
[380.86 → 385.76] Next Saturday there's a food drive and that's the districts are competing against each other
[385.76 → 389.26] to collect the most amount of food for Langley Food Bank.
[390.04 → 395.62] All the details for that are in your bulletin or the midweek memo and when your drop-off time
[395.62 → 397.28] there is available as well.
[397.28 → 406.16] But we did want to share with you that this past week we heard that Langley Food Bank is all but out of baby food.
[407.44 → 414.32] And so if you are thinking what particular item can you give, we can stock their shelves with baby food.
[414.40 → 419.42] That's a need that they have expressed to us and so let's perhaps do our part to meet them in that.
[419.42 → 426.90] Also, this morning in our gathered worship here in the building is the first opportunity we have for children's worship time
[426.90 → 427.94] to take place again.
[427.94 → 429.98] And yeah, we had a cheer over there.
[430.06 → 430.60] That's awesome.
[430.80 → 435.14] We're really excited for that, and we're grateful for the people who have volunteered to make that happen
[435.14 → 437.82] but we are still looking for more volunteers.
[438.02 → 443.22] And so if you can serve in that way, it would be a huge blessing to those of us who are able to gather here.
[443.22 → 451.48] As well, the Rosarito shoebox drive that we have been doing where people have been making toques and submitting that.
[452.14 → 456.48] We want to say thank you for the incredible response to that, and we have enough toques.
[457.26 → 459.38] And so please, don't start making new ones.
[459.46 → 463.52] If you're going to finish a couple off, go ahead and do that and bring those to the church.
[463.58 → 464.50] But we have enough toques.
[464.50 → 471.02] There are other items that we can give, and we can donate and send down to Jody in Mexico there.
[471.02 → 475.96] And so look in the midweek memo and the e-bulletin for those other items.
[476.14 → 479.16] And again, thank you for the incredible response to that.
[480.02 → 487.24] As well, I want to invite you to a live-streamed sing-along service that we're going to have tonight
[487.24 → 490.20] that will begin at 7.30 and that will be on YouTube.
[490.46 → 493.98] And so we'll have a team of people here leading us in song.
[494.08 → 499.24] And so since it's hard for us to sing here in the space, we want to encourage people to sing at home.
[499.24 → 505.56] And so join us at 7.30 for that live stream event called Sing a New Song Unto the Lord.
[506.34 → 513.24] And then last one, this past week in the midweek memo, there was an announcement about our summer preaching series
[513.24 → 514.88] that's coming up called Ask Anything.
[515.64 → 521.38] And that means through the summer, pastors Kevin and Josh and me, we will be answering all of your questions
[521.38 → 524.34] or at least 10 of them for the 10 weeks of summer.
[524.34 → 530.06] And so if you have questions about life, faith, Christianity, philosophy, or the like, submit those questions.
[530.20 → 532.34] There are all sorts of ways on how you can do that.
[532.40 → 536.26] And we would love to wrestle through those together with you over the course of the summer.
[537.30 → 538.46] I think I got them all.
[539.12 → 540.22] Thank you for your patience.
[540.78 → 542.04] Let's worship our God together.
[542.14 → 545.42] And so why don't we stand, and we can receive God's greeting.
[545.42 → 551.86] God is here.
[552.44 → 556.64] He calls us to himself, and he welcomes us into his presence.
[557.28 → 564.52] Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Saviour,
[564.92 → 567.78] through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[569.00 → 569.42] Amen.
[570.06 → 570.84] Let's worship God.
[570.84 → 570.90] Amen.
[570.90 → 570.94] Amen.
[575.42 → 586.24] Our call to worship this morning is inspired by Isaiah 55, where it says, or it doesn't say it exactly.
[586.44 → 587.44] It's inspired by it.
[587.66 → 590.18] Come to the water, all who thirst.
[590.60 → 593.14] Come drink deeply from the river of life.
[594.08 → 596.48] Come to the water, all who are weary.
[597.12 → 597.46] Come.
[598.06 → 601.04] Rest in the quiet pools of God's love.
[601.04 → 605.00] Come to the water, all who long for justice.
[605.88 → 608.82] Come, be renewed in God's ever-flowing stream.
[609.76 → 619.56] For God is here among us, washing away the dust and grime of our lives and pouring out the Spirit on all of us who thirst.
[619.56 → 619.72] Amen.
[619.72 → 619.80] Amen.
[619.80 → 621.72] Amen.
[621.72 → 622.72] Amen.
[622.72 → 623.72] Amen.

[660.96 → 661.00] Amen.
[661.00 → 661.02] Amen.
[661.02 → 669.26] Be washed away in the waves of His mercy
[669.26 → 676.02] As deep cries out too deep
[676.58 → 682.90] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[682.90 → 691.72] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[691.72 → 695.64] All who are thirsty
[695.64 → 701.90] All who are weak
[701.90 → 705.00] Come to the fountain
[705.00 → 710.60] Keep your heart in the stream of night
[710.60 → 712.86] And the pain and the sorrow
[712.86 → 722.42] Be washed away in the waves of His mercy
[722.42 → 728.92] As deep cries out too deep
[728.92 → 734.84] Holy Spirit, come
[734.84 → 744.84] Holy Spirit, come
[744.84 → 751.84] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[751.84 → 760.84] Come, Lord Jesus, come
[760.84 → 779.16] Join me in a confession and assurance prayer
[779.16 → 784.28] Gracious and merciful God
[784.28 → 787.76] We bring before you this morning our sins
[787.76 → 790.06] Which are often too heavy to carry
[790.06 → 792.32] Too real to hide
[792.32 → 794.84] And too deep to undo
[794.84 → 799.58] Please, Lord, forgive what our lips tremble to name
[799.58 → 802.98] What our hearts find so difficult to bear
[802.98 → 805.60] And what can become for us
[805.60 → 809.36] A consuming fire of self-judgment
[809.36 → 813.40] We know that you set us free from the past
[813.40 → 815.62] That we are helpless to change
[815.62 → 818.90] Lord, open for us a future
[818.90 → 821.82] In which we will be changed through you
[821.82 → 825.56] Grant us grace to grow more and more
[825.56 → 827.24] In your likeness and image
[827.24 → 830.42] We pray this through Jesus Christ
[830.42 → 831.14] Our light
[831.14 → 833.02] And the light of the world
[833.02 → 834.68] Amen
[834.68 → 840.50] Amen
[841.00 → 842.46] Amen
[842.46 → 843.66] Amen
[843.66 → 845.36] Amen

[919.30 → 920.68] beginning at
[920.68 → 921.98] the end

[1032.10 → 1038.52] I invite you to be seated
[1038.52 → 1049.94] Good morning everybody
[1049.94 → 1051.68] Hello to those of you at home
[1051.68 → 1054.56] And good morning to everybody here at church
[1054.56 → 1055.64] Welcome to Kids Corner
[1055.64 → 1058.16] If you don't know me, my name is Mrs. Nikki
[1058.16 → 1060.70] And I'm going to jump right in today
[1060.70 → 1062.64] To our new memory verse
[1062.64 → 1065.28] Because I have learned that I tend to talk a lot
[1065.28 → 1066.06] During this time
[1066.06 → 1067.26] So I have to be fast
[1067.26 → 1070.20] So our memory verse for the month of June
[1070.20 → 1071.28] It's a new one
[1071.28 → 1073.56] But I want you to listen to it
[1073.56 → 1074.76] I'm going to just read it out
[1074.76 → 1076.38] And then I want you to think about
[1076.38 → 1078.88] If it sounds familiar at all to you
[1078.88 → 1080.34] So it goes like this
[1080.34 → 1082.24] Love the Lord your God
[1082.24 → 1083.46] With all your heart
[1083.46 → 1084.68] With all your soul
[1084.68 → 1085.88] With all your mind
[1085.88 → 1087.26] And with all your strength
[1087.26 → 1089.60] I better look at it
[1089.60 → 1091.48] And the second is like it
[1091.48 → 1093.58] Love your neighbour as yourself
[1093.58 → 1096.04] There is no commandment greater than these
[1096.04 → 1099.08] Maybe you've heard that verse before
[1099.08 → 1099.68] It's possible
[1099.68 → 1100.98] It's a pretty common verse
[1100.98 → 1103.76] But there's another reason why it might sound familiar
[1103.76 → 1107.26] And it has to do with our memory verses here at Emmanuel
[1107.26 → 1110.30] You might have to think quite a bit back
[1110.30 → 1112.06] All the way back to the fall
[1112.06 → 1114.58] Does anybody know why it sounds familiar?
[1115.06 → 1117.98] Can anyone think of a memory verse that we have done
[1117.98 → 1120.50] That is really close to this one?
[1120.50 → 1123.58] Does anybody here at church know?
[1124.36 → 1124.64] Yep
[1124.64 → 1135.54] That's right
[1135.54 → 1136.28] So she said
[1136.28 → 1137.84] Love the Lord your God
[1137.84 → 1138.74] With all your heart
[1138.74 → 1139.74] With all your soul
[1139.74 → 1140.54] With all your strength
[1140.54 → 1142.16] And that was our memory verse
[1142.16 → 1143.78] Way back in October
[1143.78 → 1146.08] From Deuteronomy 6 verse 5
[1146.08 → 1149.32] So you can tell that this one is really close to it
[1149.32 → 1150.86] But also just a little bit different
[1150.86 → 1152.84] So in this memory verse
[1152.84 → 1154.14] We have
[1154.14 → 1155.42] It's from the book of Mark
[1155.42 → 1156.80] So in the book of Mark
[1156.80 → 1158.02] This is Jesus speaking
[1158.02 → 1159.06] And he's speaking
[1159.06 → 1161.38] To a teacher of the law
[1161.38 → 1162.48] So a teacher of the law
[1162.48 → 1163.64] Someone who really knew
[1163.64 → 1165.72] The commands of God
[1165.72 → 1166.52] From the Old Testament
[1166.52 → 1167.62] Well comes to Jesus
[1167.62 → 1168.40] And he says
[1168.40 → 1170.90] What is the greatest commandment?
[1171.08 → 1172.24] Out of all the commandments
[1172.24 → 1173.24] All the ones about
[1173.24 → 1174.40] The ten commandments
[1174.40 → 1175.90] And all the sacrifices
[1175.90 → 1176.88] And the festivals
[1176.88 → 1178.52] There are a lot of commandments
[1178.52 → 1179.24] In the Bible
[1179.24 → 1180.44] And he's saying to Jesus
[1180.44 → 1182.22] Well which one is the most important one?
[1182.76 → 1184.80] And this is what Jesus' answer is
[1184.80 → 1185.54] He says
[1185.54 → 1186.72] Love the Lord your God
[1186.72 → 1188.84] And then love your neighbour as yourself
[1188.84 → 1190.22] These are the greatest ones
[1190.22 → 1191.70] So when I was thinking
[1191.70 → 1192.04] I thought
[1192.04 → 1192.96] Well if Jesus says
[1192.96 → 1194.46] These are the greatest commandments
[1194.46 → 1195.54] Then it's probably something
[1195.54 → 1196.22] We should remember
[1196.22 → 1198.42] So we're going to do some actions
[1198.42 → 1200.26] To help us remember them
[1200.26 → 1201.54] And some of them will be familiar
[1201.54 → 1204.74] Because we use them in Deuteronomy 6 verse 5
[1204.74 → 1207.46] So I invite you to do them along with me
[1207.46 → 1209.18] And that will help us remember them
[1209.18 → 1210.74] So now I have lots of people here
[1210.74 → 1211.66] I get to see you do it
[1211.66 → 1212.42] It's very exciting
[1212.42 → 1214.18] So we're going to start like this
[1214.18 → 1214.74] I'll show you
[1214.74 → 1216.48] And then you can do it after with me
[1216.48 → 1217.62] I'm going to go
[1217.62 → 1219.66] Love the Lord your God
[1219.66 → 1220.78] With all your heart
[1220.78 → 1222.50] With all your soul
[1222.50 → 1224.34] With all your mind
[1224.34 → 1226.14] And with all your strength
[1226.14 → 1228.70] And the second is like it
[1228.70 → 1232.32] Love your neighbour as yourself
[1232.32 → 1235.90] There is no commandment greater than these
[1235.90 → 1239.24] And it's from Mark 12 verse 30 to 31
[1239.24 → 1240.96] So now you get to practice
[1240.96 → 1241.86] It's practice time
[1241.86 → 1243.16] So do it along with me
[1243.16 → 1245.56] And that will help us remember it together
[1245.56 → 1249.12] So love the Lord your God
[1249.12 → 1250.36] With all your heart
[1250.36 → 1251.98] With all your soul
[1251.98 → 1253.60] With all your mind
[1253.60 → 1255.22] And with all your strength
[1255.22 → 1257.52] And the second is like it
[1257.52 → 1261.08] Love your neighbour as yourself
[1261.08 → 1264.54] There is no commandment greater than these
[1264.54 → 1266.88] Mark 12 verse 30 to 31
[1266.88 → 1269.30] So we'll work on that for the month of June
[1269.30 → 1270.02] And just a reminder
[1270.02 → 1271.92] If anybody wants one of these
[1271.92 → 1272.86] To hang on your fridge
[1272.86 → 1273.68] Or help you remember
[1273.68 → 1274.94] If you're at church
[1274.94 → 1276.70] They're available at where you sign in
[1276.70 → 1278.70] If you come to the church during the week
[1278.70 → 1279.90] They'll be at the foyer
[1279.90 → 1281.20] Where you sign in for church
[1281.20 → 1285.20] Or you can save it off of the midweek memo
[1285.20 → 1286.18] Or the e-bulletin
[1286.18 → 1287.46] If you want a digital copy
[1287.46 → 1290.14] Now before we get into the story
[1290.14 → 1291.88] I have a new challenge
[1291.88 → 1293.68] It's kind of like a challenge month
[1293.68 → 1294.34] Here at Emanuel
[1294.34 → 1295.46] We've got the food challenge
[1295.46 → 1296.18] And, so I thought
[1296.18 → 1297.44] Well let's have another challenge
[1297.44 → 1298.46] And this one is
[1298.46 → 1301.00] The Emanuel Memory Verse Challenge
[1301.00 → 1302.84] And the challenge is going to be
[1302.86 → 1306.94] To remember all nine of our memory verses
[1306.94 → 1308.46] That we've done since October
[1308.46 → 1309.90] So I was thinking
[1309.90 → 1312.76] Why do we memorize memory verses?
[1312.90 → 1314.84] Is it just to remember them for a month
[1314.84 → 1316.52] And then we forget them
[1316.52 → 1317.76] And move on to the next one?
[1318.54 → 1319.84] Well I think we all would say
[1319.84 → 1320.74] No of course not
[1320.74 → 1321.98] But sometimes that happens
[1321.98 → 1323.90] They kind of sneak out of our memory
[1323.90 → 1326.08] But what we want is that
[1326.08 → 1328.86] God's words are in our head
[1328.86 → 1329.42] In our heart
[1329.42 → 1330.94] So that in our regular life
[1330.94 → 1332.80] They come to our mind
[1332.80 → 1334.72] So when you're out doing something
[1334.72 → 1335.72] And you're frustrated
[1335.72 → 1336.42] And you're upset
[1336.42 → 1338.38] You can think of a verse
[1338.38 → 1339.02] That would help you
[1339.02 → 1340.08] Or you're feeling upset
[1340.08 → 1340.98] With your sibling
[1340.98 → 1341.74] And you think
[1341.74 → 1343.40] Okay I remember the verse in James
[1343.40 → 1345.24] That says be slow to speak
[1345.24 → 1346.38] Slow to become angry
[1346.38 → 1347.36] Be quick to listen
[1347.36 → 1349.42] Or something exciting
[1349.42 → 1350.32] Happens in your life
[1350.32 → 1350.78] And you go
[1350.78 → 1352.82] Oh I want to praise God
[1352.82 → 1353.24] And you think
[1353.24 → 1354.52] I will give thanks to the Lord
[1354.52 → 1355.22] With all my heart
[1355.22 → 1357.04] I will tell of his wonderful deeds
[1357.04 → 1357.98] And it reminds you
[1357.98 → 1360.48] To speak of God's work
[1360.48 → 1361.34] In your life to others
[1361.34 → 1362.78] So the point is that
[1362.78 → 1364.28] They're all getting remembered
[1364.28 → 1365.30] So the challenge is
[1365.30 → 1367.04] You remember all nine verses
[1367.04 → 1368.74] If you think you remember that
[1368.74 → 1370.48] And you might need to refresh them
[1370.48 → 1371.22] I understand
[1371.22 → 1372.74] I forgot our memory verse
[1372.74 → 1373.26] Halfway through
[1373.26 → 1374.12] So I get that
[1374.12 → 1375.32] Refresh them
[1375.32 → 1375.88] Look them over
[1375.88 → 1377.06] And if you think you can recite
[1377.06 → 1377.92] All nine of them
[1377.92 → 1379.46] I do need proof
[1379.46 → 1380.24] I do trust you
[1380.24 → 1381.32] But I kind of need proof
[1381.32 → 1382.68] So what you can do
[1382.68 → 1383.32] Is you can either
[1383.32 → 1384.62] Take a video of yourself
[1384.62 → 1385.74] And send it to me
[1385.74 → 1388.20] You can also contact me
[1388.20 → 1389.46] And you can do it in person
[1389.46 → 1391.14] Or you can come to the church
[1391.14 → 1392.08] And Pastor Kevin
[1392.08 → 1392.98] Or Pastor Chris
[1392.98 → 1394.72] Will listen to you
[1394.72 → 1395.66] Recite it as well
[1395.66 → 1397.78] Now like always
[1397.78 → 1398.64] The memory verses
[1398.64 → 1399.62] Aren't just for kids
[1399.62 → 1400.54] So this challenge
[1400.54 → 1401.42] Is for anybody
[1401.42 → 1402.52] It's for kids
[1402.52 → 1403.50] It's for teenagers
[1403.50 → 1404.66] Adults
[1404.66 → 1405.22] Everybody
[1405.22 → 1406.38] Everyone can do it
[1406.38 → 1407.88] And I do have prizes
[1407.88 → 1409.58] Because challenges need prizes
[1409.58 → 1410.88] It's fun when there's a prize
[1410.88 → 1412.20] And the prizes are
[1412.20 → 1413.86] Child and adult friendly
[1413.86 → 1415.82] So you will be excited
[1415.82 → 1416.82] To get a prize
[1416.82 → 1418.48] Not that I'm bribing you
[1418.48 → 1420.06] To learn God's words
[1420.06 → 1421.34] But sometimes
[1421.34 → 1423.88] We just need a little prize
[1423.88 → 1424.46] Anyway
[1424.46 → 1425.54] So please do that
[1425.54 → 1427.58] The challenge starts tomorrow
[1427.58 → 1428.36] How about
[1428.36 → 1429.18] And it's going to go
[1429.18 → 1430.32] Until June 20th
[1430.32 → 1432.12] So we got until June 20th
[1432.12 → 1432.60] To do
[1432.60 → 1434.56] To go through the
[1434.56 → 1434.92] Remember
[1434.92 → 1436.28] Anytime in between there
[1436.28 → 1437.46] You can send it in
[1437.46 → 1438.58] And then we'll connect
[1438.58 → 1439.02] About that
[1439.02 → 1441.12] All right
[1441.12 → 1443.40] Let's start with our story here
[1443.40 → 1444.84] We'll start
[1444.84 → 1445.50] Let's keep going
[1445.50 → 1446.04] With our story
[1446.04 → 1448.62] So today our story
[1448.62 → 1450.10] Is from the book of Acts again
[1450.10 → 1451.38] So kids you might remember
[1451.38 → 1452.28] That we've been learning
[1452.28 → 1454.34] About one of the disciples
[1454.34 → 1455.76] And his name is Peter
[1455.76 → 1457.54] And Jesus has gone
[1457.54 → 1458.46] Back into heaven
[1458.46 → 1459.78] And he's given the disciples
[1459.78 → 1460.92] A special job
[1460.92 → 1462.96] To share the good news
[1462.96 → 1464.56] Of Jesus' death
[1464.56 → 1465.34] And resurrection
[1465.34 → 1467.76] With the world around them
[1467.76 → 1469.56] So let's think about
[1469.56 → 1470.16] Some of the things
[1470.16 → 1470.70] That we remember
[1470.70 → 1471.38] Peter's done
[1471.38 → 1473.26] He's received the Holy Spirit
[1473.26 → 1474.04] That happened
[1474.04 → 1475.04] We learned about that
[1475.04 → 1475.86] A few weeks ago
[1475.86 → 1477.42] Then he
[1477.42 → 1478.38] What did he do
[1478.38 → 1479.84] I wrote them down here
[1479.84 → 1480.96] He always preached
[1480.96 → 1481.74] To lots of people
[1481.74 → 1482.08] Of course
[1482.08 → 1483.02] Thousands of people
[1483.02 → 1483.88] Have learned about
[1483.88 → 1485.26] God's good news
[1485.26 → 1486.72] He's raised somebody
[1486.72 → 1487.42] From the dead
[1487.42 → 1487.82] Do you remember
[1487.82 → 1488.92] That story last week
[1488.92 → 1489.64] Tabitha
[1489.64 → 1491.08] He raised her from the dead
[1491.08 → 1492.68] And he's also healed
[1492.68 → 1493.92] A man who couldn't walk
[1493.92 → 1494.96] So those are some
[1494.96 → 1495.82] Of the things he's done
[1495.82 → 1496.70] That we've learned about
[1496.70 → 1498.28] We have a problem
[1498.28 → 1498.88] This week
[1498.88 → 1500.42] A big problem
[1500.42 → 1502.68] Peter is in prison
[1502.68 → 1505.32] How is he going to
[1505.32 → 1506.40] Continue God's work
[1506.40 → 1506.88] In prison
[1506.88 → 1508.48] That is the question
[1508.48 → 1509.68] So let's learn
[1509.68 → 1511.04] Because it's pretty exciting
[1511.04 → 1513.44] So we have King Herod
[1513.44 → 1514.04] Now you might
[1514.04 → 1514.96] When you think of this
[1514.96 → 1515.84] You go oh King Herod
[1515.84 → 1516.76] I know who that is
[1516.76 → 1517.98] Well just so you know
[1517.98 → 1519.28] There's a lot of King Herod's
[1519.28 → 1520.38] So this is not
[1520.38 → 1521.26] The King Herod
[1521.26 → 1522.90] Who tried to kill
[1522.90 → 1523.60] Baby Jesus
[1523.60 → 1524.40] That was a different
[1524.40 → 1524.94] King Herod
[1524.94 → 1526.26] It's not the King Herod
[1526.26 → 1527.66] Who killed John the Baptist
[1527.66 → 1529.74] That was yet another King Herod
[1529.74 → 1531.40] This is a new one
[1531.40 → 1532.18] They're all related
[1532.18 → 1533.02] And they like to use
[1533.02 → 1534.16] The same name of course
[1534.16 → 1535.86] So this is a new King Herod
[1535.86 → 1538.02] But like the other King Herod's
[1538.02 → 1539.54] He is very opposed
[1539.54 → 1540.58] To the work of Jesus
[1540.58 → 1541.42] In the world
[1541.42 → 1543.78] So he has a lot of power
[1543.78 → 1545.18] And he ruled in a time
[1545.18 → 1547.00] That after Jesus ascended
[1547.00 → 1548.80] And he wanted to use his power
[1548.80 → 1550.62] To harm Jesus' followers
[1550.62 → 1552.70] He arrested Peter
[1552.70 → 1553.76] And he put him in prison
[1553.76 → 1554.84] Even though Peter
[1554.84 → 1555.98] Didn't do anything wrong
[1555.98 → 1558.40] King Herod was angry
[1558.40 → 1559.54] That Peter loved
[1559.54 → 1560.50] And praised Jesus
[1560.50 → 1561.58] And he was angry
[1561.58 → 1563.16] That Peter told the good news
[1563.16 → 1564.06] Everywhere he went
[1564.06 → 1566.10] So he ordered his soldiers
[1566.10 → 1568.04] To lock Peter up in chains
[1568.04 → 1569.42] To place him in prison
[1569.42 → 1570.56] And to guard him
[1570.56 → 1571.44] Very carefully
[1571.44 → 1573.68] This will put an end
[1573.68 → 1574.62] To Peter's preaching
[1574.62 → 1575.92] Harold snarled to himself
[1575.92 → 1577.64] Now let's see what happens
[1577.64 → 1579.08] To all this talk about Jesus
[1579.08 → 1580.68] And about the wonderful things
[1580.68 → 1582.84] Peter says Jesus can do
[1582.84 → 1584.84] While Herod's soldiers
[1584.84 → 1586.44] Had to obey their angry king
[1586.44 → 1588.20] So they chained Peter up
[1588.20 → 1589.14] With two chains
[1589.14 → 1590.76] And they placed him in a cell
[1590.76 → 1591.76] With two guards
[1591.76 → 1593.78] And then two more guards
[1593.78 → 1595.08] Stood at the entrance
[1595.08 → 1596.10] Just to make sure
[1596.10 → 1597.54] He would not escape
[1597.54 → 1599.44] They watched him every minute
[1599.44 → 1601.18] They even made him sleep
[1601.18 → 1603.12] In between two different guards
[1603.12 → 1603.72] In a cell
[1603.72 → 1606.88] Poor Peter
[1606.88 → 1608.34] He was stuck
[1608.34 → 1610.58] How do you think Peter felt
[1610.58 → 1611.46] When he was locked
[1611.46 → 1612.44] In a prison cell
[1612.44 → 1615.16] I think he might have felt
[1615.16 → 1616.30] Frustrated
[1616.30 → 1618.76] Maybe he was sad
[1618.76 → 1620.32] Maybe he was upset
[1620.32 → 1621.16] With what happened
[1621.16 → 1623.42] What do you think
[1623.42 → 1624.66] Peter could have thought of
[1624.66 → 1625.36] To make him feel better
[1625.36 → 1626.20] Do you think that he
[1626.20 → 1627.28] Was recalling
[1627.28 → 1628.66] Verses that he knew
[1628.66 → 1630.06] Or things Jesus said to him
[1630.06 → 1631.64] To help keep his spirits up
[1631.64 → 1632.96] Maybe he was singing
[1632.96 → 1634.90] Or while he was afraid
[1634.90 → 1636.74] Well Peter's friends
[1636.74 → 1638.06] They were getting together
[1638.06 → 1639.04] In a house nearby
[1639.04 → 1639.74] The prison
[1639.74 → 1640.58] And they were praying
[1640.58 → 1641.16] For Peter
[1641.16 → 1642.88] Peter's friends believed
[1642.88 → 1644.24] That Jesus was with Peter
[1644.24 → 1645.34] And that Jesus could do
[1645.34 → 1646.14] Wonderful things
[1646.14 → 1647.12] That no person
[1647.12 → 1648.00] Had the power to do
[1648.00 → 1648.74] So they prayed
[1648.74 → 1650.58] They prayed all through the day
[1650.58 → 1651.94] And all through the night
[1651.94 → 1653.68] Well one night
[1653.68 → 1654.80] Peter was asleep
[1654.80 → 1655.86] Between the two guards
[1655.86 → 1656.96] He was all chained up
[1656.96 → 1658.78] An amazing thing happened
[1658.78 → 1659.76] In the dark
[1659.76 → 1660.72] And quiet prison
[1660.72 → 1662.18] Out of nowhere
[1662.18 → 1664.12] An angel appeared
[1664.12 → 1665.14] In Peter's cell
[1665.14 → 1667.04] The angel poked Peter
[1667.04 → 1667.68] In his side
[1667.68 → 1668.54] And whispered in his ear
[1668.54 → 1668.96] Quick
[1668.96 → 1669.94] Get up
[1669.94 → 1671.76] Well the soldiers
[1671.76 → 1672.66] Who were next to Peter
[1672.66 → 1673.80] Well they didn't move a muscle
[1673.80 → 1675.72] The soldiers at the door
[1675.72 → 1676.88] Continued to snore
[1676.88 → 1678.92] Peter could rub his eyes
[1678.92 → 1679.72] And try to figure out
[1679.72 → 1680.36] What was happening
[1680.36 → 1681.86] Then the chains
[1681.86 → 1682.72] That were holding him
[1682.72 → 1683.44] Fell off
[1683.44 → 1685.14] The soldiers
[1685.14 → 1685.92] Who were guarding Peter
[1685.92 → 1687.16] Still didn't move a muscle
[1687.16 → 1688.82] They continued to sleep
[1688.82 → 1690.54] The angel said to Peter
[1690.54 → 1691.40] Put on your clothes
[1691.40 → 1692.48] Put on your sandals
[1692.48 → 1693.68] Put on your coat
[1693.68 → 1694.50] And follow me
[1694.50 → 1694.98] Hurry
[1694.98 → 1697.02] Peter must have thought
[1697.02 → 1697.76] He was dreaming
[1697.76 → 1699.40] But without saying a word
[1699.40 → 1700.54] He obeyed the angel
[1700.54 → 1702.94] The soldiers guarding Peter
[1702.94 → 1703.86] Didn't move a muscle
[1703.86 → 1705.40] And the soldiers at the door
[1705.40 → 1706.82] Continued to snore
[1706.82 → 1709.04] I don't know why
[1709.04 → 1710.38] The soldiers didn't wake up
[1710.38 → 1712.10] But Peter followed the angel
[1712.10 → 1713.54] He walked right past
[1713.54 → 1714.48] The sleepy soldiers
[1714.48 → 1715.30] Who guarded him
[1715.30 → 1717.50] Right past the snoring soldiers
[1717.50 → 1718.16] At the door
[1718.16 → 1720.38] Right out of the prison gate
[1720.38 → 1722.78] Which opened all by itself
[1722.78 → 1725.12] I wonder how quiet
[1725.12 → 1726.02] Peter had to be
[1726.02 → 1727.10] As he tiptoed
[1727.10 → 1728.12] Past the soldiers
[1728.12 → 1729.10] Out of the jail
[1729.10 → 1730.14] Out of the city
[1730.14 → 1733.16] Peter must have thought
[1733.16 → 1734.64] He was having a wonderful dream
[1734.64 → 1735.88] A dream where he escaped
[1735.88 → 1736.46] From jail
[1736.46 → 1738.22] But when he rubbed his eyes
[1738.22 → 1739.14] And he looked around him
[1739.14 → 1740.26] The angel was gone
[1740.26 → 1741.60] But so were the guards
[1741.60 → 1742.64] The prison bars
[1742.64 → 1743.36] The chains
[1743.36 → 1744.18] The heavy gates
[1744.18 → 1744.84] Peter knew
[1744.84 → 1746.02] He wasn't dreaming
[1746.02 → 1747.22] It was real
[1747.22 → 1749.12] Jesus had sent an angel
[1749.12 → 1750.18] To rescue Peter
[1750.18 → 1751.10] And keep him safe
[1751.10 → 1753.64] So Peter
[1753.64 → 1754.72] Raced as fast as he could
[1754.72 → 1755.54] To Mary's house
[1755.54 → 1756.18] Where his friends
[1756.18 → 1757.46] Were all praying for him
[1757.46 → 1758.70] You think his friends
[1758.70 → 1759.80] Would have been so happy
[1759.80 → 1760.86] And excited to see him
[1760.86 → 1762.36] He could hardly wait
[1762.36 → 1762.82] To tell him
[1762.82 → 1763.26] So he went
[1763.26 → 1764.16] And he knocked on the door
[1764.16 → 1764.50] And he said
[1764.50 → 1764.90] It's me
[1764.90 → 1765.50] It's Peter
[1765.50 → 1766.66] I escaped from jail
[1766.66 → 1767.42] Let me in
[1767.42 → 1768.78] Well the servant
[1768.78 → 1769.86] The servant Rhonda
[1769.86 → 1770.98] Came to answer the door
[1770.98 → 1772.30] But she was so excited
[1772.30 → 1772.88] That he was there
[1772.88 → 1774.18] That she forgot to let him in
[1774.18 → 1775.48] So she ran back
[1775.48 → 1776.10] To the others
[1776.10 → 1777.34] Peter was free
[1777.34 → 1778.42] He was right here
[1778.42 → 1778.96] Outside
[1778.96 → 1781.02] The others thought
[1781.02 → 1781.82] How can that be
[1781.82 → 1782.78] Well he's in prison
[1782.78 → 1783.80] That can't be true
[1783.80 → 1785.68] But Rhonda wouldn't give up
[1785.68 → 1787.06] So they went back to the door
[1787.06 → 1787.86] And there was Peter
[1787.86 → 1788.60] Still knocking
[1788.60 → 1789.50] Trying to get in
[1789.50 → 1790.82] They must have been
[1790.82 → 1791.78] So surprised
[1791.78 → 1793.50] If you were Peter's friend
[1793.50 → 1795.14] Would you have been surprised?
[1795.14 → 1796.10] What would you have thought
[1796.10 → 1796.96] When you saw him
[1796.96 → 1797.72] At the door?
[1798.94 → 1799.72] Well Peter motioned
[1799.72 → 1800.70] For everyone to be quiet
[1800.70 → 1801.48] And he told them
[1801.48 → 1802.80] How God had answered his prayer
[1802.80 → 1804.04] How he sent an angel
[1804.04 → 1805.52] To rescue him from prison
[1805.52 → 1808.44] Meanwhile back in the prison
[1808.44 → 1809.62] The guards and the soldiers
[1809.62 → 1810.38] Woke up
[1810.38 → 1811.62] And what did they realize?
[1811.74 → 1813.26] That Peter was gone
[1813.26 → 1816.08] Well they had to run out of there too
[1816.08 → 1817.42] Because King Herod
[1817.42 → 1818.78] Was going to be pretty angry
[1818.78 → 1819.60] When he discovered
[1819.60 → 1820.98] That his prisoner was gone
[1820.98 → 1823.12] That God had answered
[1823.12 → 1825.00] The prayers of Peter's friends
[1825.00 → 1827.60] And that he was free
[1827.60 → 1828.64] To continue to share
[1828.64 → 1829.36] The good news
[1829.36 → 1830.28] With those around him
[1830.28 → 1833.16] That's a pretty crazy story
[1833.16 → 1835.50] It would be pretty hard to believe
[1835.50 → 1836.76] Even for Peter himself
[1836.76 → 1839.00] But we know that God
[1839.00 → 1839.66] Is with us
[1839.66 → 1840.56] He answers prayers
[1840.56 → 1841.74] And we're going to
[1841.74 → 1842.86] Continue learning about that
[1842.86 → 1843.80] Whether you're at home
[1843.80 → 1845.18] Or if you're here
[1845.18 → 1845.68] And coming to
[1845.68 → 1846.42] Children's Worship Time
[1846.42 → 1847.34] So let's pray together
[1847.34 → 1848.40] For a moment first
[1848.40 → 1850.86] Lord Jesus
[1850.86 → 1851.44] We thank you
[1851.44 → 1852.64] That you hear our prayers
[1852.64 → 1854.02] Thank you for the amazing
[1854.02 → 1855.48] Works that you did
[1855.48 → 1856.46] In the life of Peter
[1856.46 → 1857.98] Thank you for the ways
[1857.98 → 1858.64] That you used him
[1858.64 → 1859.58] To share the gospel
[1859.58 → 1860.86] With the world around him
[1860.86 → 1862.34] And how we can still learn
[1862.34 → 1863.36] From those stories
[1863.36 → 1864.14] Today
[1864.14 → 1865.88] We pray that we would
[1865.88 → 1867.30] Trust you
[1867.30 → 1868.42] And that we would
[1868.42 → 1869.56] Share your good news
[1869.56 → 1870.50] With our community
[1870.50 → 1871.06] And our world
[1871.06 → 1871.78] Just like Peter
[1871.78 → 1872.74] Amen
[1882.64 → 1885.00] Good morning
[1885.00 → 1887.28] It sure is good
[1887.28 → 1888.08] To be here again
[1888.08 → 1889.02] It's been a long time
[1889.02 → 1890.10] Since I've had the opportunity
[1890.10 → 1890.82] To do this
[1890.82 → 1893.54] So we will now
[1893.54 → 1894.98] Continue our worship
[1894.98 → 1896.12] Through the giving
[1896.12 → 1896.90] Of our offerings
[1896.90 → 1899.48] In Hebrews 6 verse 10
[1899.48 → 1900.04] We read
[1900.04 → 1901.26] God is not unjust
[1901.26 → 1902.60] He will not forget
[1902.60 → 1903.10] Your work
[1903.10 → 1903.62] And the love
[1903.62 → 1904.50] You have shown him
[1904.50 → 1905.72] As you have helped
[1905.72 → 1906.22] His people
[1906.22 → 1907.80] And continue to help them
[1907.80 → 1909.98] Our gifts today
[1909.98 → 1910.74] Are for the budget
[1910.74 → 1912.00] To support the ministries
[1912.00 → 1913.02] Of this congregation

[1914.98 → 1917.34] Wellspring UBC Okanagan

[1919.34 → 1920.30] Is also supported
[1920.30 → 1922.02] By the Kelowna CRC
[1922.02 → 1922.86] Their mission
[1922.86 → 1924.14] Is to seek to equip
[1924.14 → 1925.32] And encourage students
[1925.32 → 1926.80] Staff and faculty
[1926.80 → 1928.80] To be lifelong

[2046.86 → 2047.72] From Male Brueggemann

[2078.30 → 2081.26] Thanks as well
[2081.26 → 2082.12] For our speech
[2082.12 → 2082.96] Back to you
[2082.96 → 2085.48] The speech of mothers
[2085.48 → 2086.58] And fathers
[2086.58 → 2087.86] Who dared to speak
[2087.86 → 2088.46] In faith

[2101.62 → 2103.04] As we trust yours
[2103.04 → 2105.66] Listen this day
[2105.66 → 2106.76] For the groans
[2106.76 → 2107.62] And yearnings
[2107.62 → 2109.10] Of your word
[2109.10 → 2111.16] Listen to our own
[2111.16 → 2112.06] Songs of joy
[2112.06 → 2113.28] And our own
[2113.28 → 2114.20] Drudges of death
[2114.20 → 2115.92] And in the midst
[2115.92 → 2117.22] Of our stammering
[2117.22 → 2118.88] Speak your clear
[2118.88 → 2119.82] Word of life
[2119.82 → 2121.50] In the name

[2122.52 → 2123.60] Come flesh
[2123.60 → 2130.02] Lord as a church
[2130.02 → 2130.70] As we gather
[2130.70 → 2132.56] Here or in line
[2132.56 → 2133.92] We come together
[2133.92 → 2135.00] To share
[2135.00 → 2135.94] In the pain
[2135.94 → 2137.12] Of loss
[2137.12 → 2137.88] With our indigenous
[2137.88 → 2138.72] Communities
[2138.72 → 2139.42] As we learned
[2139.42 → 2140.50] About the discovery
[2140.50 → 2143.20] Of 215 children
[2143.20 → 2143.74] Buried
[2143.74 → 2145.02] On the site
[2145.02 → 2145.56] Of a formal
[2145.56 → 2146.48] Residential school
[2146.48 → 2147.08] In Kamloops
[2147.08 → 2148.90] Lord a story
[2148.90 → 2149.40] Like this
[2149.40 → 2149.92] Stirs up
[2149.92 → 2150.70] A lot of emotion
[2150.70 → 2151.34] And questions
[2151.34 → 2153.72] We pray
[2153.72 → 2154.62] For your peace
[2154.62 → 2155.28] That passes
[2155.28 → 2156.22] All understanding
[2156.22 → 2157.10] In our communities
[2157.10 → 2159.44] May our political
[2159.44 → 2160.44] And church leaders
[2160.44 → 2162.12] Seek reparation
[2162.12 → 2163.84] As we continue
[2163.84 → 2165.46] To move towards
[2165.46 → 2166.86] Reconciliation
[2166.86 → 2168.50] With our indigenous
[2168.50 → 2169.04] Peoples
[2169.04 → 2170.36] In this country
[2170.36 → 2174.42] We pray for comfort
[2174.42 → 2174.90] On Amy
[2174.90 → 2175.40] Bangers
[2175.40 → 2176.00] In the family
[2176.00 → 2176.80] As Amy's mother
[2176.80 → 2177.46] Passed away
[2177.46 → 2177.92] This week
[2177.92 → 2178.60] In Bellingham
[2178.60 → 2180.64] She passed away
[2180.64 → 2181.82] Due to COVID-19
[2181.82 → 2183.10] And Amy was unable
[2183.10 → 2183.88] To visit her
[2183.88 → 2186.34] During her last days
[2186.34 → 2188.50] So Lord we pray
[2188.50 → 2189.06] For comfort
[2189.06 → 2189.72] And strength
[2189.72 → 2190.12] On them
[2190.12 → 2190.96] As a family
[2190.96 → 2192.30] As they grieve
[2192.30 → 2192.70] The loss
[2192.70 → 2193.14] Of her mom
[2193.14 → 2195.66] And Lord
[2195.66 → 2196.18] For others
[2196.18 → 2197.04] Who are
[2197.04 → 2198.58] Who've lost
[2198.58 → 2199.12] Loved ones
[2199.12 → 2199.96] Either recently
[2199.96 → 2201.38] Or maybe
[2201.38 → 2202.40] A while ago
[2202.40 → 2204.68] The pain
[2204.68 → 2205.68] Sometimes never
[2205.68 → 2206.32] Leaves
[2206.32 → 2208.94] And may our
[2208.94 → 2209.56] Memories of our
[2209.56 → 2209.98] Loved ones
[2209.98 → 2210.94] Remain
[2210.94 → 2212.94] But Lord
[2212.94 → 2213.54] Let us also
[2213.54 → 2214.16] Be reminded
[2214.16 → 2214.74] About your
[2214.74 → 2215.46] Great power
[2215.46 → 2216.22] On the cross
[2216.22 → 2217.02] And your resurrection
[2217.02 → 2217.72] That death
[2217.72 → 2218.32] Does not have
[2218.32 → 2219.02] The final say
[2219.02 → 2223.34] Lord we're thankful
[2223.34 → 2224.28] For John Denham's
[2224.28 → 2224.68] Recovery
[2224.68 → 2226.12] From a recent
[2226.12 → 2226.72] Heart attack
[2226.72 → 2228.12] And we pray
[2228.12 → 2228.70] That you continue
[2228.70 → 2229.14] To give him
[2229.14 → 2229.66] Strength
[2229.66 → 2230.92] As he builds
[2230.92 → 2231.64] Up strength
[2231.64 → 2234.58] We pray too
[2234.58 → 2235.28] For Pearl
[2235.28 → 2236.98] As she continues
[2236.98 → 2238.50] To provide
[2238.50 → 2239.38] Care for him
[2239.38 → 2241.34] During his recovery
[2241.34 → 2242.24] May she also
[2242.24 → 2243.02] Experience your
[2243.02 → 2243.84] Strength and peace
[2243.84 → 2244.08] Too
[2244.08 → 2247.66] Lord we pray
[2247.66 → 2248.18] For all those
[2248.18 → 2248.96] In our congregation
[2248.96 → 2249.74] Who are recovering
[2249.74 → 2250.52] From surgery
[2250.52 → 2252.82] May they continue
[2252.82 → 2253.42] To feel your
[2253.42 → 2254.20] Healing presence
[2254.20 → 2254.90] In their life
[2254.90 → 2257.70] Lord we're
[2257.70 → 2258.26] Thankful for the
[2258.26 → 2259.04] Opportunity to gather
[2259.04 → 2260.06] In person once again
[2260.06 → 2261.90] And we continue
[2261.90 → 2262.84] To pray for insight
[2262.84 → 2263.32] And wisdom
[2263.32 → 2264.00] For the leadership
[2264.00 → 2264.96] Of this church
[2264.96 → 2266.00] As well as those
[2266.00 → 2266.68] Who are volunteering
[2266.68 → 2267.66] Their time
[2267.66 → 2268.60] As changes are made
[2268.60 → 2269.36] From week to week
[2269.36 → 2271.24] We pray also
[2271.24 → 2272.04] For a spirit of
[2272.04 → 2273.12] Patience and cooperation
[2273.12 → 2274.08] And working together
[2274.08 → 2275.00] As we navigate
[2275.00 → 2275.74] These changes
[2275.74 → 2278.32] Lord we pray
[2278.32 → 2278.62] Pray for the
[2278.62 → 2278.98] Nearness
[2278.98 → 2279.60] Your nearness
[2279.60 → 2280.26] To all those
[2280.26 → 2281.40] In our congregation
[2281.40 → 2282.58] Who are isolated
[2282.58 → 2283.80] Or shut in
[2283.80 → 2284.96] Or maybe experiencing
[2284.96 → 2285.56] Loneliness
[2285.56 → 2286.24] Or depression
[2286.24 → 2287.02] And anxiety

[2292.30 → 2292.90] These days
[2292.90 → 2293.62] Lord, and we pray
[2293.62 → 2294.84] That they experience
[2294.84 → 2295.52] Your unfailing
[2295.52 → 2296.12] Strength and
[2296.12 → 2296.72] Encouragement
[2296.72 → 2298.44] During this time
[2298.44 → 2300.62] We pray for those
[2300.62 → 2301.26] In our congregation
[2301.26 → 2301.62] Who have been
[2301.62 → 2302.68] Diagnosed with COVID
[2302.68 → 2304.82] For quick healing
[2304.82 → 2305.58] And the Lord's hand

[2348.06 → 2349.18] Into the summer months
[2349.18 → 2349.98] We are hopeful
[2349.98 → 2351.76] As we see
[2351.76 → 2353.44] The light at the end
[2353.44 → 2353.90] Of the tunnel
[2353.90 → 2355.86] We also give thanks

[2379.90 → 2380.38] And students
[2380.38 → 2380.96] In our schools
[2380.96 → 2381.58] As they prepare
[2381.58 → 2382.52] To finish well
[2382.52 → 2384.32] Especially in a
[2384.32 → 2385.16] Challenging year

[2387.94 → 2388.54] Are experiencing
[2388.54 → 2389.92] Fatigue and weariness

[2393.40 → 2393.92] And give them
[2393.92 → 2394.66] An extra measure
[2394.66 → 2395.56] Of your strength
[2395.56 → 2396.22] And perseverance
[2396.22 → 2397.24] In the final weeks
[2397.24 → 2398.02] Of the school year
[2398.02 → 2400.34] And Lord now
[2400.34 → 2401.18] As Pastor Chris
[2401.18 → 2402.06] Comes up to deliver

[2403.08 → 2403.80] That we may
[2403.80 → 2405.30] Have hearts to hear
[2405.30 → 2406.54] Your message
[2406.54 → 2407.40] Your words
[2407.40 → 2408.28] To us today
[2408.28 → 2409.86] And that we may
[2409.86 → 2410.96] Apply it
[2410.96 → 2412.80] To our lives
[2412.80 → 2413.40] This week
[2413.40 → 2414.74] In your name
[2414.74 → 2415.28] We pray
[2415.28 → 2416.68] Amen
[2416.68 → 2424.14] Before we
[2424.14 → 2425.76] Open God's word
[2425.76 → 2426.20] Together
[2426.20 → 2428.20] I just want to
[2428.20 → 2428.94] Echo something
[2428.94 → 2430.16] That Kevin
[2430.16 → 2430.72] Was praying
[2430.72 → 2431.38] And add
[2431.38 → 2432.52] My voice
[2432.52 → 2432.92] To that
[2432.92 → 2434.00] As we
[2434.00 → 2434.86] Cry out
[2434.86 → 2435.22] With
[2435.22 → 2436.74] Our
[2436.74 → 2438.96] Indigenous
[2438.96 → 2439.56] Canadians
[2439.56 → 2440.54] And
[2440.54 → 2441.64] Mourn
[2441.64 → 2442.32] With them
[2442.32 → 2443.52] There's been
[2443.52 → 2444.16] A lot of talk
[2444.16 → 2445.50] About churches
[2445.50 → 2445.98] And people
[2445.98 → 2446.68] Being silent
[2446.68 → 2447.30] And I just want
[2447.30 → 2447.58] To say
[2447.58 → 2447.92] That we
[2447.92 → 2448.38] Are not
[2448.38 → 2448.90] Silent
[2448.90 → 2450.64] And that
[2450.64 → 2451.10] There are
[2451.10 → 2452.40] Lots of
[2452.40 → 2452.86] Voices
[2452.86 → 2453.54] And lots
[2453.54 → 2454.02] Of prayers
[2454.02 → 2454.48] And lots
[2454.48 → 2455.48] Of efforts
[2455.48 → 2456.22] That is coming
[2456.22 → 2456.64] Out of our
[2456.64 → 2456.94] Church
[2456.94 → 2457.68] And the people
[2457.68 → 2458.42] We support
[2458.42 → 2459.16] And work with
[2459.16 → 2460.62] And so if you
[2460.62 → 2461.28] Haven't seen it
[2461.28 → 2461.82] Yet we've made
[2461.82 → 2462.28] A number of
[2462.28 → 2463.00] Those resources

[2587.50 → 2587.82] Would not
[2587.82 → 2588.16] Rain
[2588.16 → 2588.58] And it
[2588.58 → 2589.00] Did not
[2589.00 → 2589.26] Rain
[2589.26 → 2589.64] On the

[2591.36 → 2592.90] Again
[2592.90 → 2593.54] He prayed

[2594.10 → 2594.52] Heavens
[2594.52 → 2595.22] Gave rain
[2595.22 → 2595.56] And the

[2597.00 → 2598.96] My
[2598.96 → 2599.22] Brothers
[2599.22 → 2599.84] And sisters
[2599.84 → 2601.86] If any
[2601.86 → 2602.82] Of you
[2602.82 → 2603.50] Should wander
[2603.50 → 2603.92] From the
[2603.92 → 2604.28] Truth
[2604.28 → 2604.92] And someone

[2611.66 → 2612.06] Of their
[2612.06 → 2612.38] Way
[2612.38 → 2613.08] Will save
[2613.08 → 2613.34] Them
[2613.34 → 2614.04] From death
[2614.04 → 2614.66] And cover
[2614.66 → 2615.38] Over a

[2635.54 → 2635.94] Of stuff
[2635.94 → 2636.36] To do
[2636.36 → 2636.68] In a
[2636.68 → 2637.02] Day
[2637.02 → 2638.20] The first
[2638.20 → 2638.54] Thing you
[2638.54 → 2638.94] Do is
[2638.94 → 2639.30] Make a
[2639.30 → 2639.64] List
[2639.64 → 2641.90] Now
[2641.90 → 2642.52] I confess
[2642.52 → 2642.82] That's
[2642.82 → 2643.26] Something I
[2643.26 → 2643.46] Don't
[2643.46 → 2643.94] Understand
[2643.94 → 2646.80] If the
[2646.80 → 2647.16] First thing
[2647.16 → 2647.40] You have
[2647.40 → 2647.70] To do
[2647.70 → 2648.34] Is make
[2648.34 → 2648.60] A list
[2648.60 → 2648.84] Aren't

[2650.26 → 2651.04] To the
[2651.04 → 2651.38] List
[2651.38 → 2651.82] Of things
[2651.82 → 2652.62] You have
[2652.62 → 2652.94] To do
[2652.94 → 2654.06] Now how
[2654.06 → 2654.30] Many of
[2654.30 → 2654.62] You actually
[2654.62 → 2655.18] Would start

[2658.88 → 2662.64] I'm not
[2662.64 → 2663.00] A list
[2663.00 → 2663.32] Maker
[2663.32 → 2664.26] You're probably
[2664.26 → 2664.88] Figuring that
[2664.88 → 2665.02] Out
[2665.02 → 2665.64] I am a
[2665.64 → 2666.30] Note taker
[2666.30 → 2667.98] But I'm
[2667.98 → 2668.24] Not a
[2668.24 → 2668.82] List maker
[2668.82 → 2670.70] Rachel

[2674.94 → 2675.18] Maker
[2675.18 → 2675.62] She is
[2675.62 → 2676.00] The kind
[2676.00 → 2676.30] Of list
[2676.30 → 2676.52] Maker
[2676.52 → 2677.02] Who writes
[2677.02 → 2677.38] Make a
[2677.38 → 2677.76] List on
[2677.76 → 2678.10] Top of
[2678.10 → 2678.42] The list
[2678.42 → 2678.76] So that
[2678.76 → 2679.02] She can
[2679.02 → 2679.38] Cross it
[2679.38 → 2679.52] Off
[2679.52 → 2679.70] Of the
[2679.70 → 2679.98] List
[2679.98 → 2682.64] Years ago
[2682.64 → 2684.32] We moved
[2684.32 → 2685.16] To the
[2685.16 → 2685.66] U.S.
[2685.70 → 2685.96] We moved
[2685.96 → 2686.28] To Grand
[2686.28 → 2686.60] Rapids
[2686.60 → 2687.76] Michigan
[2687.76 → 2688.32] So I
[2688.32 → 2688.76] Could go
[2688.76 → 2689.60] To school
[2689.60 → 2691.36] And she
[2691.36 → 2691.66] Did the
[2691.66 → 2692.12] Same thing
[2692.12 → 2692.46] When we
[2692.46 → 2692.96] Moved back
[2692.96 → 2693.48] Three years
[2693.48 → 2693.76] Later
[2693.76 → 2694.22] Back to
[2694.22 → 2694.66] Ontario
[2694.66 → 2695.72] She had
[2695.72 → 2696.68] An itemized

[2697.52 → 2698.50] Categorized
[2698.50 → 2699.24] Colour coded
[2699.24 → 2699.84] List of
[2699.84 → 2700.60] Every single
[2700.60 → 2701.12] Possession
[2701.12 → 2701.78] We owned
[2701.78 → 2702.34] And had
[2702.34 → 2703.08] Packed away
[2703.08 → 2704.20] And stacked
[2704.20 → 2704.78] Into the
[2704.78 → 2705.02] Moving
[2705.02 → 2705.34] Truck
[2705.34 → 2706.88] Now I
[2706.88 → 2707.06] Didn't
[2707.06 → 2707.44] Realize
[2707.44 → 2707.78] We had
[2707.78 → 2707.94] That
[2707.94 → 2708.16] Much
[2708.16 → 2708.70] Stuff
[2708.70 → 2709.44] Right
[2709.44 → 2710.38] But when
[2710.38 → 2710.72] Eating
[2710.72 → 2711.30] Utensils
[2711.30 → 2711.76] And cooking

[2713.36 → 2713.98] Each get
[2713.98 → 2714.34] A line
[2714.34 → 2714.60] On the
[2714.60 → 2714.90] List
[2714.90 → 2715.52] Rather than
[2715.52 → 2716.44] Just utensils
[2716.44 → 2717.80] Or cutlery
[2717.80 → 2719.28] Lists
[2719.28 → 2719.74] Start to
[2719.74 → 2720.12] Expand
[2720.12 → 2722.96] Now I
[2722.96 → 2723.12] Don't know
[2723.12 → 2723.36] How many
[2723.36 → 2723.56] Of you
[2723.56 → 2724.10] Have moved
[2724.10 → 2724.88] Internationally
[2724.88 → 2725.56] Before but
[2725.56 → 2725.86] When you
[2725.86 → 2726.54] Move into
[2726.54 → 2726.98] A new
[2726.98 → 2727.44] Country
[2727.44 → 2728.40] The customs
[2728.40 → 2728.88] Officials
[2728.88 → 2729.56] Have every
[2729.56 → 2729.96] Right
[2729.96 → 2731.42] Even the
[2731.42 → 2731.94] Prerogative
[2731.94 → 2732.74] Really to
[2732.74 → 2733.78] Open up
[2733.78 → 2734.22] The truck
[2734.22 → 2734.60] And to
[2734.60 → 2735.08] Go through
[2735.08 → 2735.74] Whatever it
[2735.74 → 2736.80] Is that
[2736.80 → 2738.28] They choose
[2738.28 → 2739.56] And so we
[2739.56 → 2740.14] Drove up to
[2740.14 → 2740.50] The border
[2740.50 → 2740.96] Crossing
[2740.96 → 2742.32] We handed
[2742.32 → 2742.76] Them our
[2742.76 → 2743.20] Exchange
[2743.20 → 2743.58] Visitor
[2743.58 → 2744.50] Paperwork
[2744.50 → 2745.06] And the
[2745.06 → 2745.92] Giant list
[2745.92 → 2746.50] Which Rachel
[2746.50 → 2747.00] Had nicely
[2747.00 → 2747.62] Put together
[2747.62 → 2748.50] In a binder
[2748.50 → 2749.08] With colour
[2749.08 → 2749.86] Coded tabs
[2749.86 → 2750.52] For each
[2750.52 → 2751.04] Section in
[2751.04 → 2751.42] Each room
[2751.42 → 2751.72] In each
[2751.72 → 2752.04] House
[2752.04 → 2753.20] And all
[2753.20 → 2753.44] Of our
[2753.44 → 2753.86] Possessions
[2753.86 → 2754.30] The guy
[2754.30 → 2755.04] Flipped through
[2755.04 → 2755.64] The pages
[2755.64 → 2756.16] He looked
[2756.16 → 2756.44] At our
[2756.44 → 2756.80] Truck
[2756.80 → 2757.48] He looked
[2757.48 → 2757.96] At Rachel
[2757.96 → 2758.26] And he
[2758.26 → 2758.50] Said
[2758.50 → 2760.06] I wish
[2760.06 → 2760.74] Everyone did
[2760.74 → 2761.12] This when
[2761.12 → 2761.60] They moved
[2761.60 → 2763.18] Have a nice
[2763.18 → 2763.50] Day
[2763.50 → 2764.68] And we
[2764.68 → 2765.20] Drove right
[2765.20 → 2765.54] Through
[2765.54 → 2767.90] Now sometimes
[2767.90 → 2768.72] Lists help
[2768.72 → 2772.12] In the series
[2772.12 → 2772.54] That we have
[2772.54 → 2773.56] Been looking
[2773.56 → 2774.84] At in
[2774.84 → 2775.22] James
[2775.22 → 2775.54] We've
[2775.54 → 2775.94] Looked at
[2775.94 → 2776.72] Every bit
[2776.72 → 2777.98] Of James
[2777.98 → 2778.56] Now I
[2778.56 → 2778.86] Don't know
[2778.86 → 2779.72] About you
[2779.72 → 2780.62] But it's
[2780.62 → 2780.98] Been really
[2780.98 → 2781.34] Interesting
[2781.34 → 2781.82] For me
[2781.82 → 2782.38] And fun
[2782.38 → 2782.96] For me
[2782.96 → 2784.00] To start
[2784.00 → 2784.24] At the
[2784.24 → 2784.48] Beginning
[2784.48 → 2784.80] Of the
[2784.80 → 2785.02] Book
[2785.02 → 2785.36] And to
[2785.36 → 2785.90] Work our
[2785.90 → 2786.22] Way
[2786.22 → 2786.96] All the
[2786.96 → 2787.14] Way
[2787.14 → 2787.40] Through
[2787.40 → 2787.80] And I've
[2787.80 → 2788.18] Really
[2788.18 → 2788.74] Been
[2788.74 → 2789.92] Appreciative
[2789.92 → 2790.34] And really
[2790.34 → 2790.90] Encouraged
[2790.90 → 2791.58] By your
[2791.58 → 2792.26] Interaction
[2792.26 → 2793.10] And your
[2793.10 → 2793.44] Emails
[2793.44 → 2795.72] Forum
[2795.72 → 2795.98] And
[2795.98 → 2805.06] perfect. And I hope that in this series, we've seen the importance of making our faith real by
[2805.06 → 2811.12] being hearers and doers of the Word, right? That's the phrase that we have been using throughout.
[2811.20 → 2816.24] That's the title of this series, Hearers and Doers, and it comes from chapter 1, verse 22.
[2816.78 → 2822.56] Maybe you remember it, right? Do not merely listen to the Word and so deceive yourselves,
[2822.56 → 2831.92] but do what it says, right? It's not enough just to hear it. You got to do it. Christian living,
[2832.16 → 2838.34] Christian discipleship, following Jesus, having a faith made real means it's going to show up in
[2838.34 → 2843.66] your life. You're going to look different. You're going to talk differently. Furthermore, you're going to do
[2843.66 → 2853.56] different. You're going to be different. And we've said it all along. If you are a Christian,
[2854.26 → 2862.44] but your life is no different from the next guy who's not, you've got to be asking yourself some
[2862.44 → 2869.72] pretty hard questions. And if you say that you love God and you even go to church, or you haven't
[2869.72 → 2877.04] missed a digital service in the last five months, but you sound and look exactly like the girl over
[2877.04 → 2886.08] there in every other aspect of your life, what really is the point? Faith without deeds is dead.
[2886.68 → 2895.58] That's what James says in this letter. Hearers who aren't doers deceive themselves into thinking that
[2895.58 → 2902.60] we aren't really dead, that we aren't really spiritually dead and stuck in whatever mire this
[2902.60 → 2912.92] is. But if on the other hand, you are doing and making your faith real, there's an assurance that
[2912.92 → 2920.62] comes to us, right? If you are working to take every thought captive to Christ, if you are fighting to
[2920.62 → 2928.70] make every square inch of your life belong to Jesus, if you are hearing and doing, that is God
[2928.70 → 2935.20] working in his spirit in you to transform you into the image of Jesus, his son.
[2937.90 → 2948.32] Your doing is the fruit of a real faith. And throughout this letter, we have seen James take the
[2948.32 → 2954.22] teachings of Jesus that he has internalized and expand on them. He's doing the same thing here.
[2955.10 → 2959.36] Jesus says in Matthew 7, near the end of the Sermon on the Mount, he says,
[2960.64 → 2968.10] by their fruit, you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes or figs from thistles?
[2969.12 → 2975.94] Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A good fruit tree cannot bear
[2975.94 → 2981.48] bad fruit. And a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down
[2981.48 → 2991.12] and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit, you will recognize them. By their fruit, you are recognized
[2991.12 → 3004.02] as a genuine hearer and doer, as a faith made real disciple of Jesus. Hearers must be doers. Your faith must be
[3004.02 → 3012.06] made real. Real faith is shown by the real fruit in your life. And the fruit of the Spirit is love,
[3012.54 → 3019.56] joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
[3021.62 → 3027.80] Look, here's a really simple illustration, and it's apropos of my life right now.
[3027.80 → 3034.66] You can come up with one that's more fitting for your life and situation. But if I ask my kids to
[3034.66 → 3041.04] clean their room, and they say, okay, dad, I hear you, but then they walk away and go jump on the
[3041.04 → 3048.50] trampoline, their hearing is pointless. It didn't lead to action. It didn't lead to obedience. Furthermore, it
[3048.50 → 3054.94] didn't lead to doing what they were supposed to do. But, and here's where it gets a little bit harder,
[3054.94 → 3061.78] and here's where the Bible is an equal opportunity offender or convector, right? If when my kids
[3061.78 → 3068.72] don't go clean their rooms, but go to the trampoline, and then I lose my patience, and I start yelling,
[3069.26 → 3079.84] I'm not doing any better. My fruit isn't helping them be doers. Because you see, not only am I teaching
[3079.84 → 3086.32] my kids how to respond when they get angry by how I respond when I get angry, right? And so I really
[3086.32 → 3091.66] do want to model gentleness and respect. I really do want to show patience to them. But even more than
[3091.66 → 3101.00] that, my life is a testimony of God to them. Your life is telling a story of faith and faithfulness.
[3101.00 → 3106.94] And to be really clear, your life is meant to be telling the story of Jesus.
[3108.98 → 3116.44] Jesus who, yes, when he was angry overturned tables. But the same Jesus who listened to Peter
[3116.44 → 3124.68] and restored him to love and purpose after Peter denied him three times. The same Jesus who sees
[3124.68 → 3133.96] Judas approach him in the garden to betray him with a kiss and still says, friend, do what you must.
[3134.80 → 3140.14] The same Jesus who, while hanging on the cross, and the people who were gathered around him hurled
[3140.14 → 3146.92] insults at him and mocked him, said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they are doing.
[3146.92 → 3157.28] You can be gentle because Jesus was gentle for you. You can be faithful to others because Jesus was
[3157.28 → 3164.38] faithful for you. You can love others because he first loved you. What Jesus did for you,
[3164.52 → 3170.46] he is now doing in you so that he can do it through you to others around you.
[3170.46 → 3185.26] And so, even when my friend and colleague beats me at golf and then publicly shames me in his sermon
[3185.26 → 3195.22] for beating me at golf in a sermon on patience, I can be a model of patience. Because Jesus took all
[3195.22 → 3203.00] my impatience and bore it on the cross. My friend is still learning how to do that. Right, Pastor Kevin?
[3206.38 → 3215.28] As Christians, we have to be different. We have to live compelling lives that demand a gospel
[3215.28 → 3222.14] explanation. Point of fact, the point of James, the point of Jesus before him, the point of Paul and
[3222.14 → 3228.54] Peter beside him is that you will be different. Real faith makes you different. If anyone is in
[3228.54 → 3235.72] Christ, they are a new creation. And so, be a new creation. Be different. And if the world thinks you
[3235.72 → 3241.80] are a fool, be the biggest fool for Jesus that you can be. If the world thinks that your life is weird,
[3242.10 → 3248.32] be the weirdest, grace-giving, living person you can be. If your neighbours don't understand you,
[3248.32 → 3251.86] be the mystery that reveals the gospel to them.
[3255.86 → 3268.34] But you see, there is a danger in all of this. There is a potential unintended outcome of a sermon
[3268.34 → 3274.40] series like this, of talking about obedience like this, of talking about radical obedience as a mark of
[3274.40 → 3281.30] authentic discipleship. Right, because sometimes we just end up reducing what is supposed to be evidence
[3281.30 → 3289.92] of heart transformation into a checklist of behaviours and attitudes to cross off.
[3291.12 → 3298.90] That we can nicely organize, and we can say, done, did it, got it, good.
[3298.90 → 3306.36] We make a list of things that we are supposed to do and a list of things that we are not supposed to do
[3306.36 → 3313.86] and we work hard at that. We like to check boxes because that's manageable, especially when it's
[3313.86 → 3321.64] manageable in our own power and our own ability. That's the kind of religion we want. Make it clear,
[3322.02 → 3327.36] make it obvious. Don't make it too hard, but don't make it too easy either because I don't want it to be
[3327.36 → 3332.84] that easy. Tell me exactly where the boundary line is so that I can come right up to the edge,
[3333.16 → 3338.12] maybe stick my toe over it just a little bit, but so I know how far is too far.
[3340.66 → 3349.02] In life, we like lists because it helps us stay on track and make sure we get it all done. In our
[3349.02 → 3354.98] religion and our faith, we like lists because it's concrete, and ultimately it helps feed our excuses.
[3354.98 → 3361.94] Well, that's not on the list, so it must be a bit of a gray area. I think it'll be okay.
[3362.78 → 3366.58] I don't have to worry about that. I don't have to be different in that.
[3368.46 → 3374.72] And so, as we end this series on James, if you're coming out of it thinking like that,
[3374.84 → 3379.28] like that, if you're coming out of it thinking that we've just created a long list and checklist,
[3379.28 → 3385.58] then we haven't done it right as leaders and preachers, or you haven't heard it right.
[3387.00 → 3391.50] Because you see, through it all, I've been, and I know that Kevin and Josh were too,
[3391.86 → 3399.48] very careful to leave, in one part, the application up to you. And don't get me wrong, right? I think
[3399.48 → 3404.62] we've preached a very practical, meaning-filled series on here, but we've intentionally preached
[3404.62 → 3412.56] principles more than prescribed actions. We do the work of preaching in the power of the Spirit and
[3412.56 → 3418.12] prayer. You do the work of application in the same power of the Spirit and prayer.
[3420.48 → 3428.26] And so today, as we end here, this Christian living isn't a series of checklists to be managed.
[3428.26 → 3435.54] Christian living isn't a series of checklists to be managed. Instead, a hearer and doer faith made
[3435.54 → 3442.84] real has a series of checks and balances by which we manage life and faith.
[3444.26 → 3450.26] What we see in these eight verses, these last verses of James, is what we've seen throughout the
[3450.26 → 3457.10] whole letter. James is giving us principles to live by as hearers and doers.
[3457.10 → 3464.80] Remember, this isn't a checklist to cross off so that you can say you did it. These are checks by
[3464.80 → 3472.12] which you live a balanced Christian life. And so I see five of them for us to focus on quickly.
[3473.10 → 3482.72] A hearer and doer prays. A hearer and doer praises. Three, a hearer and doer belongs to a people.
[3482.72 → 3489.16] Four, a hearer and doer practices confession. And then five, lastly, a hearer and doer practices
[3489.16 → 3497.54] discipleship. If you like lists, here it is for you in a list format. Prayer, praise, part of a people,
[3497.84 → 3506.06] practice confession, practice discipleship. Start with prayer. Is anyone among you in trouble? James says.
[3506.06 → 3512.20] Let them pray. Is anyone sick? Let them call on the elders to pray.
[3513.10 → 3519.26] He goes on. Pray for each other. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.
[3519.82 → 3524.82] Prayer is mentioned seven times in this little section. Prayer is all over it.
[3525.08 → 3527.56] And prayer should be all over the Christian life.
[3527.56 → 3536.78] Look, James just finished a discussion on patience and Pastor Kevin walked us through that. And so often
[3536.78 → 3542.92] when we think about patience, we think about just sort of waiting around. But the kind of patience that
[3542.92 → 3552.56] is fruit of the Spirit is not passive patience. It's active patience. Prayer is the act of faith.
[3552.56 → 3561.80] Prayer is the lifeblood of Christian living. The kind of patience James is talking about only comes from God
[3561.80 → 3571.24] and prayer is the way to get it. So how do you pray? How often do you pray?
[3573.08 → 3577.74] Maybe all you ever pray is a form prayer and those are good. Don't hear what I'm not saying. Those are so
[3577.74 → 3582.08] good and so important as we are learning how to pray. And Jesus teaches his disciples in the Lord's
[3582.08 → 3589.96] prayer. And we've recited that for millennia since then. But maybe try something extemporaneous
[3589.96 → 3597.18] and free form. Maybe try a listening prayer. Because prayer works. It really does.
[3599.76 → 3608.38] I was two months into my ministry as pastor. 27 years old. Super green. No real experience.
[3608.38 → 3615.56] And a member of our church was in the hospital. 80 something years old. He couldn't breathe. He had
[3615.56 → 3623.16] been on supplemental oxygen for 15 years. By all accounts, he was dying. One of the church elders
[3623.16 → 3629.86] called me up and said, let's go to the hospital and anoint John with oil and pray for healing.
[3629.86 → 3635.12] He said, that's what James tells us to do. So that's what we should do.
[3637.54 → 3640.36] So who might argue with James? That's what we did.
[3641.74 → 3646.48] The prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well. The Lord will raise him up.
[3648.54 → 3649.54] Two days later,
[3650.74 → 3651.42] John died.
[3652.80 → 3656.02] Grounded by his wife and kids as they sang,
[3656.02 → 3657.54] Great is thy faithfulness together.
[3660.34 → 3661.64] And I thought to myself,
[3662.52 → 3662.92] Man,
[3663.60 → 3664.34] I prayed.
[3664.92 → 3666.16] I prayed in faith.
[3666.58 → 3668.02] I anointed him with oil.
[3668.28 → 3669.72] And I had the church elders there.
[3670.08 → 3671.72] We checked every box.
[3673.76 → 3674.88] And it didn't work.
[3677.08 → 3679.70] Christian living isn't a series of checklists
[3679.70 → 3680.80] to be managed.
[3681.16 → 3681.88] It is principles
[3681.88 → 3683.14] to live by.
[3684.02 → 3684.72] Later that day,
[3684.84 → 3686.90] I sat down across from his wife
[3686.90 → 3688.08] and with tears
[3688.08 → 3690.84] mixed with a twinkle in her eye
[3690.84 → 3694.00] like only an 80-year-old Dutch lady can have
[3694.00 → 3694.88] every once in a while,
[3695.00 → 3695.50] she said,
[3695.90 → 3697.66] The Lord answered my prayer.
[3698.72 → 3699.72] And I know that
[3699.72 → 3701.42] he will raise John up.
[3702.48 → 3704.20] It wasn't the healing I wanted,
[3704.58 → 3706.10] but it was the healing he needed.
[3707.30 → 3708.66] She helped me see that.
[3708.66 → 3712.22] Prayer matters.
[3715.54 → 3717.08] Hearer and doer praises.
[3718.20 → 3719.12] Is anyone happy?
[3719.24 → 3719.68] James says,
[3719.80 → 3721.10] Let them sing.
[3721.18 → 3722.64] Now, I don't have to tell you this, right?
[3722.76 → 3724.28] But Christians sing.
[3724.82 → 3725.60] Even now,
[3725.74 → 3727.30] when we can't sing,
[3727.36 → 3728.22] I know some of you are.
[3728.68 → 3729.60] Some of you can't help it.
[3730.58 → 3730.70] Right?
[3730.74 → 3732.54] And so you're singing quietly into your mass
[3732.54 → 3733.14] because you're not sure
[3733.14 → 3734.32] what the person beside you is going to say.
[3734.46 → 3735.30] But it just happens.
[3735.68 → 3736.80] It happens to me all the time
[3736.80 → 3737.94] in these services.
[3738.66 → 3741.50] Christians sing.
[3742.10 → 3742.76] We praise.
[3743.08 → 3743.72] And we worship.
[3744.48 → 3744.88] And tonight,
[3745.00 → 3746.00] there's a live stream
[3746.00 → 3747.40] and you can join us at 730.
[3748.14 → 3749.62] But all throughout the Bible,
[3749.82 → 3751.06] we are called to rejoice
[3751.06 → 3752.12] and to give thanks,
[3752.26 → 3752.70] to sing,
[3752.84 → 3753.26] to praise,
[3753.38 → 3753.86] to shout,
[3754.24 → 3755.02] to dance,
[3755.20 → 3756.40] and to be silent
[3756.40 → 3758.40] in adoration of who God is.
[3758.40 → 3761.68] I said it recently
[3761.68 → 3764.02] in one of the songs of prayer,
[3764.14 → 3764.88] weekly devotions
[3764.88 → 3766.46] that go out on Wednesdays.
[3767.24 → 3768.18] As a Christian,
[3768.38 → 3770.96] your life is a musical of praise
[3770.96 → 3772.18] to God
[3772.18 → 3773.42] as all creation
[3773.42 → 3774.42] and all the angels
[3774.42 → 3775.64] and all the saints in heaven
[3775.64 → 3777.30] and the church here below
[3777.30 → 3779.16] sings the praise of God
[3779.16 → 3780.20] in every day,
[3780.72 → 3781.42] in every way.
[3781.42 → 3784.06] Christians sing.
[3785.46 → 3787.86] Hearers and doers praise.
[3788.80 → 3792.26] Be defined by praise.
[3794.26 → 3798.10] A hearer and doer belongs to a people.
[3798.94 → 3800.72] If you've got the Bible open in front of you
[3800.72 → 3801.40] to James 5,
[3801.52 → 3803.16] look carefully at the text.
[3804.16 → 3804.56] James says,
[3804.56 → 3806.92] is anyone among you?
[3807.86 → 3809.00] Anyone among you?
[3809.10 → 3810.80] That's group language.
[3811.54 → 3812.14] He says,
[3812.48 → 3814.88] call the elders of the church.
[3815.24 → 3816.14] Of the church.
[3816.22 → 3817.14] Be part of a church.
[3817.56 → 3818.42] A Christian,
[3818.72 → 3820.20] a hearer and doer,
[3820.30 → 3821.22] a disciple of Jesus
[3821.22 → 3825.64] rightly belongs to the people of God.
[3827.12 → 3829.66] Confess your sins to each other.
[3830.64 → 3832.68] Pray for each other.
[3832.96 → 3833.56] Each other.
[3833.56 → 3835.84] Each other means each other, right?
[3835.90 → 3836.58] Each other means
[3836.58 → 3838.94] there are others around each of you
[3838.94 → 3840.58] with whom you are with
[3840.58 → 3842.36] and to whom you belong.
[3843.68 → 3844.96] These people pray together
[3844.96 → 3846.12] and sing together.
[3846.48 → 3848.14] James might be using the language
[3848.14 → 3849.10] of the elders
[3849.10 → 3850.74] who pray for the sick,
[3850.86 → 3851.52] but that's because
[3851.52 → 3853.24] they can't come to the fellowship
[3853.24 → 3854.56] because they are sick
[3854.56 → 3855.90] and so the elders go to them
[3855.90 → 3857.54] and represent the fellowship.
[3857.92 → 3859.12] Elders who are being installed
[3859.12 → 3859.86] this morning,
[3859.98 → 3860.64] hear that.
[3860.64 → 3864.28] But for everyone else,
[3864.70 → 3866.84] it's about the fellowship.
[3867.18 → 3869.12] The emphasis in verse 16
[3869.12 → 3870.40] and here is praying
[3870.40 → 3872.38] and singing with each other.
[3873.88 → 3874.70] Throughout this letter,
[3874.82 → 3875.98] James has been calling
[3875.98 → 3877.18] the readers
[3877.18 → 3879.22] brothers and sisters.
[3879.86 → 3880.60] And don't miss that.
[3880.66 → 3882.02] Don't gloss over that.
[3882.02 → 3883.96] It's just a way of talking about people.
[3883.96 → 3886.08] You are a new family.
[3887.22 → 3888.38] You belong to you
[3888.38 → 3889.84] and you belong to her
[3889.84 → 3892.02] and she belongs to him.
[3893.24 → 3894.74] We belong to each other.
[3895.78 → 3898.74] Regardless of what your biological family is,
[3898.86 → 3900.22] regardless of what happened
[3900.22 → 3901.36] in that story
[3901.36 → 3902.74] and with them,
[3903.14 → 3904.62] regardless of your past
[3904.62 → 3906.22] and your last name,
[3906.58 → 3909.44] you are part of the blood-bought family
[3909.44 → 3910.40] of Jesus
[3910.40 → 3911.54] if you believe
[3911.54 → 3912.86] by grace through faith
[3912.86 → 3915.00] and that matters more
[3915.00 → 3919.06] than any other definition of family.
[3922.82 → 3924.02] Look at verse 19.
[3924.16 → 3924.66] James writes,
[3924.78 → 3925.74] My brothers and sisters,
[3925.90 → 3927.66] if one of you should wander from the truth,
[3927.88 → 3930.66] someone should bring that person back.
[3931.42 → 3932.98] Someone should bring them back.
[3933.26 → 3933.46] Who?
[3933.62 → 3934.86] Who brings them back?
[3935.68 → 3937.12] If you wander away,
[3937.22 → 3938.38] who brings you back?
[3938.38 → 3940.42] Church.
[3941.42 → 3942.38] We do.
[3943.56 → 3944.24] I do.
[3944.68 → 3945.20] He does.
[3945.36 → 3946.32] And she does.
[3946.80 → 3948.68] The church is one of the means
[3948.68 → 3949.74] that God uses
[3949.74 → 3951.78] to keep us faithful,
[3952.20 → 3953.84] to protect our faith
[3953.84 → 3955.98] and to ensure our security
[3955.98 → 3958.18] in relationship to him.
[3959.18 → 3961.34] Be part of a people.
[3964.58 → 3967.78] Hearer and doer practices confession.
[3968.38 → 3972.44] If they have sinned,
[3972.84 → 3974.56] they will be forgiven.
[3976.36 → 3977.84] So confess your sins
[3977.84 → 3980.28] personally to God.
[3981.18 → 3982.62] 1 John says that
[3982.62 → 3984.28] if we claim to be without sin,
[3984.36 → 3985.46] we deceive ourselves
[3985.46 → 3987.62] and the truth is not in us.
[3987.62 → 3989.44] If we confess our sins,
[3989.82 → 3991.42] he is faithful and just
[3991.42 → 3993.30] and will forgive our sins
[3993.30 → 3994.52] and purify us
[3994.52 → 3995.80] from all unrighteousness.
[3995.80 → 3997.76] If we claim we have not sinned,
[3997.82 → 3999.02] we make him out to be a liar
[3999.02 → 4002.02] and his word is not in us.
[4002.42 → 4004.88] Confess your sins to God.
[4006.18 → 4007.18] But also,
[4007.54 → 4008.98] look at verse 16.
[4009.88 → 4011.06] Confess your sins
[4011.06 → 4013.08] to each other.
[4014.26 → 4016.32] But the kind of church community
[4016.32 → 4017.34] that James says
[4017.34 → 4018.94] we need to belong to
[4018.94 → 4020.68] is one that can hear
[4020.68 → 4021.84] and uphold
[4021.84 → 4023.22] each other's confession.
[4023.22 → 4023.30] confession.
[4024.68 → 4026.50] Can you trust people
[4026.50 → 4028.44] with your confession?
[4030.06 → 4030.96] And if not,
[4031.04 → 4031.54] why not?
[4032.50 → 4032.82] And sure,
[4032.92 → 4033.62] sometimes the answer
[4033.62 → 4034.42] is other people.
[4036.54 → 4037.84] But in my experience,
[4037.98 → 4038.44] the answer
[4038.44 → 4039.78] is equally,
[4040.00 → 4041.06] if not more often,
[4041.68 → 4042.84] about your own heart
[4042.84 → 4045.74] and your own fears
[4045.74 → 4047.78] and your own shame.
[4047.78 → 4050.34] I love the way
[4050.34 → 4051.66] that Dietrich Bonhoeffer
[4051.66 → 4052.70] puts it in his little book,
[4052.80 → 4053.32] Life Together.
[4054.08 → 4055.20] I'm paraphrasing here,
[4055.60 → 4056.20] but he says,
[4056.54 → 4057.76] the brother who confesses
[4057.76 → 4058.90] his sin to another one
[4058.90 → 4060.40] is no longer alone
[4060.40 → 4061.30] in his sin.
[4062.00 → 4062.38] Instead,
[4062.64 → 4063.46] he can experience
[4063.46 → 4063.96] the victory
[4063.96 → 4064.96] and the power of God
[4064.96 → 4065.50] over sin
[4065.50 → 4066.98] because of his brother.
[4068.58 → 4069.80] When you confess your sin
[4069.80 → 4071.70] to someone here in church,
[4071.78 → 4072.92] when you confess
[4072.92 → 4074.42] and open up your life
[4074.42 → 4075.34] to a brother
[4075.34 → 4077.16] or sister in Jesus Christ,
[4077.16 → 4078.66] you are no longer alone
[4078.66 → 4079.80] in whatever shame
[4079.80 → 4080.98] or guilt voice
[4080.98 → 4082.88] that is weighing you down.
[4084.38 → 4084.82] Instead,
[4085.00 → 4086.00] someone gets to speak
[4086.00 → 4086.86] the voice of Jesus
[4086.86 → 4088.30] into your heart.
[4090.14 → 4090.86] Be a means
[4090.86 → 4092.68] by which God's victory
[4092.68 → 4093.34] over sin
[4093.34 → 4094.16] is revealed
[4094.16 → 4095.24] and communicated.
[4095.68 → 4096.86] Listen to the confession
[4096.86 → 4097.64] of another
[4097.64 → 4098.80] and give them grace
[4098.80 → 4099.84] and presence
[4099.84 → 4100.68] and love.
[4101.04 → 4102.08] Give them a commitment
[4102.08 → 4103.82] to not let them be alone
[4103.82 → 4105.06] in that sin.
[4105.90 → 4106.02] Right?
[4106.14 → 4107.10] Sin and Satan
[4107.10 → 4108.20] seek to divide.
[4108.82 → 4109.98] Grace and God
[4109.98 → 4111.16] pull us together.
[4112.84 → 4114.82] Practice confession.
[4116.56 → 4117.60] And then finally,
[4117.74 → 4119.06] a hearer and doer
[4119.06 → 4120.98] practices discipleship.
[4121.26 → 4122.26] This is the last one
[4122.26 → 4123.38] for us this morning.
[4124.08 → 4125.28] We've already read it once.
[4125.92 → 4126.46] Verse 19.
[4126.58 → 4127.58] My brothers and sisters,
[4127.74 → 4128.46] if one of you
[4128.46 → 4129.84] should wander from the truth,
[4130.00 → 4130.94] someone should bring
[4130.94 → 4132.98] that person back.
[4133.36 → 4134.16] Remember this.
[4134.16 → 4135.42] Whoever turns a sinner
[4135.42 → 4136.12] from the error
[4136.12 → 4136.86] of their way
[4136.86 → 4138.38] will save them
[4138.38 → 4138.98] from death
[4138.98 → 4140.06] and cover over
[4140.06 → 4140.72] a multitude
[4140.72 → 4142.32] of sins.
[4143.90 → 4145.80] It is our responsibility
[4145.80 → 4146.72] as brothers
[4146.72 → 4147.78] and sisters,
[4148.20 → 4149.24] as disciples
[4149.24 → 4149.94] of Jesus,
[4150.18 → 4151.44] to be making
[4151.44 → 4152.34] disciples,
[4152.62 → 4153.74] to be calling
[4153.74 → 4155.46] people to lives
[4155.46 → 4156.68] of discipline
[4156.68 → 4157.82] and devotion
[4157.82 → 4158.48] and to be
[4158.48 → 4159.72] walking together
[4159.72 → 4161.12] in how we might
[4161.12 → 4162.68] do that well.
[4165.16 → 4166.08] Here at Emmanuel,
[4166.22 → 4166.70] we have this
[4166.70 → 4168.28] awesome mentorship
[4168.28 → 4169.38] program that runs
[4169.38 → 4170.92] through the youth
[4170.92 → 4171.66] program.
[4172.46 → 4173.10] And youth
[4173.10 → 4174.72] become mentors
[4174.72 → 4175.58] when they finish
[4175.58 → 4176.68] and they do it
[4176.68 → 4177.82] to the next generation.
[4178.22 → 4179.48] That's discipleship,
[4179.92 → 4180.20] friends.
[4181.16 → 4182.08] That's what all
[4182.08 → 4182.64] of our life
[4182.64 → 4183.24] and ministry
[4183.24 → 4184.40] should look like.
[4184.40 → 4186.54] We should all
[4186.54 → 4187.58] be being
[4187.58 → 4188.30] discipled
[4188.30 → 4189.98] and discipling
[4189.98 → 4190.78] others.
[4192.38 → 4193.40] This is what it
[4193.40 → 4194.16] means to
[4194.16 → 4195.46] belong.
[4197.32 → 4198.32] Christian living
[4198.32 → 4199.22] isn't a series
[4199.22 → 4200.36] of checklists
[4200.36 → 4201.60] to be managed.
[4201.76 → 4202.16] Instead,
[4202.86 → 4203.48] a hearer
[4203.48 → 4204.00] and doer
[4204.00 → 4205.14] faith made real
[4205.14 → 4205.98] has a series
[4205.98 → 4206.58] of checks
[4206.58 → 4207.40] by which we
[4207.40 → 4208.10] will manage
[4208.10 → 4208.88] life
[4208.88 → 4209.94] and faith
[4209.94 → 4210.98] in Jesus.
[4210.98 → 4213.06] And so,
[4214.10 → 4214.38] pray.
[4216.58 → 4217.68] Pray together
[4217.68 → 4219.84] and praise
[4219.84 → 4220.88] together.
[4221.72 → 4222.62] Be part of a
[4222.62 → 4223.78] people together.
[4224.34 → 4224.74] Practice
[4224.74 → 4225.44] confession
[4225.44 → 4226.32] together
[4226.32 → 4227.68] and practice
[4227.68 → 4229.32] discipleship
[4229.32 → 4230.48] together.
[4231.56 → 4232.60] This is
[4232.60 → 4233.36] who Jesus
[4233.36 → 4234.30] has made
[4234.30 → 4234.86] us
[4234.86 → 4235.84] to be.
[4236.36 → 4236.92] This is the
[4236.92 → 4237.64] life that James
[4237.64 → 4238.38] has been calling
[4238.38 → 4239.64] us to live
[4239.64 → 4240.42] as hearers
[4240.42 → 4241.32] and doers
[4241.32 → 4242.24] of the word.
[4242.64 → 4243.56] And as we
[4243.56 → 4244.08] go,
[4244.80 → 4245.70] know that you
[4245.70 → 4246.70] do not go
[4246.70 → 4247.52] alone.
[4248.60 → 4249.32] You go in the
[4249.32 → 4250.88] power of God.
[4251.62 → 4252.32] You go in the
[4252.32 → 4253.54] power of the
[4253.54 → 4253.86] gospel.
[4254.24 → 4254.96] You go with
[4254.96 → 4255.66] the power
[4255.66 → 4256.62] of the spirit
[4256.62 → 4257.72] and you go
[4257.72 → 4258.90] in the power
[4258.90 → 4259.70] of your
[4259.70 → 4260.50] brothers and
[4260.50 → 4261.00] sisters
[4261.00 → 4262.34] beside you.
[4263.30 → 4264.26] This is
[4264.26 → 4265.10] who we are
[4265.10 → 4265.76] and this
[4265.76 → 4266.50] is what it
[4266.50 → 4267.38] means to be
[4267.38 → 4268.34] a hearer
[4268.34 → 4269.56] and doer.
[4269.56 → 4270.44] Amen?
[4271.78 → 4272.86] Let's pray.
[4278.52 → 4279.70] Lord Jesus,
[4279.90 → 4281.10] help us to be
[4281.10 → 4282.64] hearers and
[4282.64 → 4283.68] doers.
[4284.22 → 4285.44] Help us to
[4285.44 → 4286.70] live in such
[4286.70 → 4287.50] a way that
[4287.50 → 4288.76] our lives
[4288.76 → 4289.74] demand a
[4289.74 → 4290.86] gospel explanation.
[4291.12 → 4291.84] Help us,
[4292.38 → 4292.82] Lord God,
[4293.82 → 4295.70] pray and
[4295.70 → 4296.86] praise to be
[4296.86 → 4297.52] a part and
[4297.52 → 4297.92] to practice
[4297.92 → 4298.46] confession
[4298.46 → 4299.34] and to
[4299.34 → 4299.70] practice
[4299.70 → 4300.50] discipleship.
[4301.58 → 4302.82] Help us
[4302.82 → 4304.48] take your
[4304.48 → 4304.88] truth
[4304.88 → 4306.18] that's planted
[4306.18 → 4307.16] deep within
[4307.16 → 4307.54] us
[4307.54 → 4308.78] to grow it
[4308.78 → 4309.64] and cultivate
[4309.64 → 4310.20] it now
[4310.20 → 4311.00] into a
[4311.00 → 4311.40] life
[4311.40 → 4312.20] live
[4312.20 → 4313.10] for your
[4313.10 → 4314.08] glory.
[4315.86 → 4317.10] Fill us
[4317.10 → 4318.40] with your
[4318.40 → 4318.76] love
[4318.76 → 4320.64] so that we
[4320.64 → 4321.48] can be
[4321.48 → 4322.48] people who
[4322.48 → 4322.90] love.
[4322.90 → 4322.94] love.
[4324.18 → 4324.96] In Jesus'
[4325.14 → 4325.46] name we
[4325.46 → 4325.72] pray.
[4326.50 → 4326.92] Amen.
[4328.06 → 4328.62] Amen.
[4328.62 → 4328.66] Amen.
[4335.06 → 4337.52] Our time of
[4337.52 → 4339.18] worship as you
[4339.18 → 4340.84] respond,
[4342.08 → 4342.52] singing in
[4342.52 → 4342.96] your heart.
[4344.96 → 4346.12] Join us.
[4346.12 → 4351.58] praise the
[4351.58 → 4353.02] Lord.
[4354.94 → 4355.90] His mercy
[4355.90 → 4356.60] is
[4356.60 → 4358.06] more
[4358.06 → 4361.94] stronger
[4361.94 → 4362.64] than
[4362.64 → 4363.34] darkness
[4363.34 → 4364.46] to
[4364.46 → 4364.96] every
[4364.96 → 4365.78] born.
[4366.22 → 4366.80] Our sins
[4366.80 → 4367.76] say are
[4367.76 → 4368.28] many.
[4368.64 → 4369.46] His mercy
[4369.46 → 4370.20] is
[4370.20 → 4371.00] more.
[4371.00 → 4372.00] Amen.
[4372.00 → 4372.50] Amen.
[4372.50 → 4373.00] Amen.
[4373.00 → 4373.06] Amen.
[4373.06 → 4374.06] Amen.
[4374.06 → 4375.06] Amen.
[4375.06 → 4375.60] God
[4375.60 → 4375.92] can
[4375.92 → 4377.06] remember
[4377.06 → 4377.36] no
[4377.36 → 4378.24] wrongs
[4378.24 → 4378.46] we
[4378.46 → 4378.92] have
[4378.92 → 4379.36] done
[4379.36 → 4380.32] wishes
[4380.32 → 4381.28] and
[4381.28 → 4381.92] knowing
[4381.92 → 4382.56] he
[4382.56 → 4383.06] taught
[4383.06 → 4383.42] out
[4383.42 → 4383.78] their
[4383.78 → 4393.68] shop
[4393.68 → 4402.18] grace
[4402.18 → 4406.98] His mercy is all.
[4408.98 → 4413.58] Stronger than darkness to every Lord,
[4414.00 → 4418.68] our sweet tale, many, His mercy is all.
[4422.24 → 4426.78] Our nations would wake us, we'd all send me home.
[4426.78 → 4431.70] What colour so tender is calling us home?
[4431.70 → 4437.94] The who welcomes the weakest, the bolus of gold,
[4438.18 → 4443.46] our sins may our planning, His mercy is all.
[4445.56 → 4454.36] Praise the Lord, His mercy is all.
[4456.54 → 4460.94] Stronger than darkness to every Lord,
[4460.94 → 4465.90] but since they are many, His mercy is all.
[4469.42 → 4474.44] What riches of kindness He lavished on us,
[4474.70 → 4479.50] His blood was a payment, His life was a cost,
[4479.50 → 4485.66] He stood in the dead we could never afford.
[4485.66 → 4490.62] His mercy is all.
[4490.62 → 4492.12] Praise the Lord, His mercy is all.
[4492.14 → 4501.90] Praise the Lord, His mercy is all.
[4501.90 → 4508.46] Stronger than darkness to every Lord,
[4508.46 → 4513.42] our sins may our planning, His mercy is all.
[4513.42 → 4519.92] Praise the Lord, His mercy is all.
[4519.92 → 4527.54] Longer than darkness to every Lord,
[4527.54 → 4532.52] our sins may our planning, His mercy is all.
[4532.52 → 4537.60] Our sins may our planning, His mercy is all.
[4537.60 → 4542.56] Lord, our sins may our planning, His mercy is all.
[4542.56 → 4542.74] I'm glad to be seated.
[4542.74 → 4543.14] Amen.
[4543.14 → 4544.90] I'm glad to be seated.
[4544.90 → 4558.70] We have the opportunity this morning
[4558.70 → 4564.36] to celebrate God's gift of faithful leadership for His people.
[4565.24 → 4567.48] And to do that in our installation this morning,
[4567.54 → 4570.56] we have a bit of a liturgy that will help us see
[4570.56 → 4574.36] the office of elder and deacon and what it does for us.
[4574.46 → 4577.40] And we will pray for God's provision
[4577.40 → 4579.12] for those people who will serve.
[4579.78 → 4581.62] And we will promise as church,
[4581.84 → 4584.92] both those here present, those participating digitally,
[4585.14 → 4588.06] and as representative of the whole body,
[4588.16 → 4589.58] because we belong to each other,
[4590.44 → 4593.44] our support and encouragement for those people.
[4594.14 → 4597.98] We joyfully thank God for elders and deacons
[4597.98 → 4600.28] who have served well and who have completed
[4600.28 → 4602.38] their term of service.
[4602.38 → 4607.88] And we praise Him for providing us with their successors.
[4609.06 → 4610.60] In the office bearers of the church,
[4610.72 → 4613.96] we see the love of Jesus for His people.
[4614.70 → 4617.40] And the Lord of the church, as the Lord of the church,
[4617.56 → 4620.62] He appoints leaders to govern in His name
[4620.62 → 4624.12] and to promote the spiritual well-being of His people.
[4624.98 → 4627.58] By His Spirit, He equips these leaders
[4627.58 → 4630.62] so that believers may grow in faith,
[4630.84 → 4633.36] develop disciplined Christian living,
[4633.68 → 4635.66] serve others in selfless love,
[4635.72 → 4638.82] and share with all the good news of salvation.
[4639.96 → 4642.98] To this end, Jesus calls you to serve
[4642.98 → 4646.90] and commands humility in your work in the church.
[4648.50 → 4650.90] Elders serve by exercising oversight
[4650.90 → 4654.56] oversight of the church in Christ's name.
[4655.36 → 4657.94] The Apostle Paul told the elders at Ephesus,
[4658.44 → 4660.78] keep watch over yourselves and all the flock
[4660.78 → 4663.40] of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers.
[4664.00 → 4666.96] Be shepherds of the church of God,
[4667.04 → 4669.56] which He bought with His own blood.
[4671.02 → 4674.24] Elders must provide for the true preaching of the word,
[4674.68 → 4679.16] instruction in faith formation for both youth and adults,
[4679.16 → 4681.40] regular celebration of the sacraments,
[4681.82 → 4683.76] and faithful counsel and discipline
[4683.76 → 4687.42] while keeping in confidence those matters entrusted to them.
[4688.10 → 4691.54] They must promote fellowship and hospitality among believers,
[4691.98 → 4693.62] ensure good order in the church,
[4693.76 → 4696.24] and stimulate witness to all people.
[4697.84 → 4701.40] Deacons serve by leading and equipping the church
[4701.40 → 4703.72] to minister to its members and the world
[4703.72 → 4707.34] in a rich diversity of ministries,
[4707.66 → 4708.92] awakening compassion,
[4709.46 → 4710.50] demonstrating mercy,
[4710.74 → 4711.70] seeking justice,
[4711.98 → 4713.96] and collaborating with God's Spirit
[4713.96 → 4717.62] for the transformations of persons and communities.
[4718.38 → 4721.16] In imitation of Christ's mercy,
[4721.60 → 4723.60] deacons teach us to love God
[4723.60 → 4724.96] and our neighbours
[4724.96 → 4726.10] and the creation
[4726.10 → 4728.54] with acts of generous sharing,
[4729.02 → 4730.04] joyful hospitality,
[4730.04 → 4731.12] thoughtful care,
[4731.54 → 4732.56] and wise stewardship
[4732.56 → 4734.78] of all God's good gifts.
[4736.18 → 4738.66] Deacons offer holistic responses
[4738.66 → 4741.42] that respect the dignity of all people,
[4741.56 → 4742.60] working to change
[4742.60 → 4745.02] exploitative structures and systems,
[4745.44 → 4746.52] equipping the church
[4746.52 → 4748.30] for ministries of reconciliation
[4748.30 → 4749.74] and peacemaking,
[4750.08 → 4752.44] and seeking opportunities for advocacy.
[4753.40 → 4756.12] To help them accomplish these tasks,
[4756.58 → 4757.82] deacons are to identify
[4757.82 → 4760.46] and develop gifts both in the church
[4760.46 → 4761.76] and in the community.
[4762.76 → 4764.32] And by adding to all this
[4764.32 → 4766.52] words of encouragement and hope,
[4766.92 → 4769.58] deacons demonstrate in word and in deed
[4769.58 → 4771.88] the care of the Lord Jesus himself.
[4773.70 → 4776.30] The tasks of elders and deacons
[4776.30 → 4777.38] call for believers
[4777.38 → 4778.74] who are Christ-like,
[4778.88 → 4780.40] who are mature in faith,
[4780.48 → 4782.12] and who exercise their offices
[4782.12 → 4785.24] with prayer, patience, and humility.
[4785.24 → 4789.30] Today, we are blessed
[4789.30 → 4792.02] and intend to ordain elders and deacons
[4792.02 → 4793.20] and to install them
[4793.20 → 4794.54] for terms of service
[4794.54 → 4796.00] in this congregation.
[4797.76 → 4799.06] As I call your name,
[4799.48 → 4801.38] I invite you to come to the front
[4801.38 → 4802.22] and find a place
[4802.22 → 4804.94] along the edge of the stage here.
[4806.20 → 4808.48] To the office of admin elder,
[4809.48 → 4810.70] we call PIM Shone.
[4810.70 → 4816.72] To the office of pastoral elder,
[4817.28 → 4818.38] we call Dave Harris,
[4819.02 → 4819.82] Ken Hogawoning,
[4820.44 → 4821.36] Eric Hubert,
[4821.78 → 4822.42] and Daryl Wind.
[4826.62 → 4828.94] And to the office of deacon,
[4829.20 → 4831.48] we call Clem Molenkamp,
[4832.20 → 4832.88] Mike Rosa,
[4833.58 → 4834.70] and Lena Cheema.
[4834.70 → 4841.14] There are big groups,
[4841.18 → 4841.58] so make room.
[4843.02 → 4843.68] Take a stage,
[4843.86 → 4844.16] stagger,
[4844.90 → 4845.44] find room.
[4845.44 → 4845.50] Find room.
[4856.30 → 4861.20] Does this work if I have my mask on?
[4862.00 → 4862.32] Good?
[4862.58 → 4862.74] Okay.
[4862.74 → 4866.04] To express your acceptance
[4866.04 → 4867.60] of these offices,
[4867.84 → 4869.06] you are asked to stand
[4869.06 → 4870.86] and hear in the presence of God
[4870.86 → 4871.58] and his church
[4871.58 → 4873.54] to answer the following questions.
[4873.88 → 4875.26] I will ask all the questions
[4875.26 → 4877.68] and then I will ask you each by name
[4877.68 → 4878.86] for your response.
[4879.62 → 4880.92] I invite you to respond by saying,
[4881.04 → 4881.40] I do,
[4882.02 → 4882.72] God helping me.
[4885.22 → 4885.58] And so,
[4885.68 → 4887.94] do you believe that in the call
[4887.94 → 4889.08] of this congregation,
[4889.74 → 4891.78] God himself is calling you
[4891.78 → 4894.00] to these holy offices?
[4895.20 → 4896.74] Do you believe that the Old
[4896.74 → 4897.60] and New Testaments
[4897.60 → 4898.72] are the word of God,
[4898.80 → 4900.66] the only infallible rule
[4900.66 → 4902.28] for faith and life?
[4903.34 → 4904.44] And do you subscribe
[4904.44 → 4905.66] to the doctrinal standards
[4905.66 → 4906.44] of this church,
[4906.76 → 4907.82] rejecting all teaching
[4907.82 → 4909.16] which contradicts them?
[4909.16 → 4910.94] And finally,
[4911.00 → 4911.84] do you promise
[4911.84 → 4912.70] to do the work
[4912.70 → 4914.18] of your offices faithfully
[4914.18 → 4915.52] in a way worthy
[4915.52 → 4916.48] of your calling
[4916.48 → 4917.36] and in submission
[4917.36 → 4918.38] to the government
[4918.38 → 4919.20] and discipline
[4919.20 → 4921.30] of this church?
[4922.26 → 4922.52] Tim,
[4922.78 → 4923.70] what is your answer?
[4927.70 → 4928.30] Dave,
[4928.48 → 4929.34] what is your answer?
[4931.84 → 4932.32] Ken,
[4932.50 → 4933.32] what is your answer?
[4935.48 → 4935.88] Daryl,
[4936.00 → 4936.70] what is your answer?
[4936.70 → 4939.58] Eric,
[4939.78 → 4940.56] what is your answer?
[4943.76 → 4944.16] Clem,
[4944.34 → 4945.16] what is your answer?
[4948.32 → 4948.72] Mike,
[4948.94 → 4949.70] what is your answer?
[4951.78 → 4952.36] And Lena,
[4952.50 → 4953.22] what is your answer?
[4955.20 → 4955.58] Amen.
[4956.30 → 4956.66] I do,
[4956.78 → 4957.82] God helping me all around
[4957.82 → 4958.70] if you couldn't hear it
[4958.70 → 4959.38] on the live stream.
[4963.42 → 4963.82] Ordinarily,
[4964.00 → 4964.84] in our services,
[4964.84 → 4965.76] at this point,
[4965.86 → 4968.40] we would commission them
[4968.40 → 4969.50] with the laying on of hands.
[4970.30 → 4971.68] And since we are
[4971.68 → 4972.86] in these COVID times,
[4972.96 → 4973.62] that can't be done
[4973.62 → 4974.54] in the ordinary way.
[4974.66 → 4975.48] We are going to do that
[4975.48 → 4977.08] in an extraordinary way
[4977.08 → 4978.50] by having all of you,
[4978.70 → 4980.26] if you are so comfortable,
[4980.48 → 4981.70] hold out your hands
[4981.70 → 4983.54] and to be representative
[4983.54 → 4984.70] of the whole church body
[4984.70 → 4985.84] which is gathering digitally
[4985.84 → 4987.60] or in the next service
[4987.60 → 4989.14] and is here represented
[4989.14 → 4990.54] by these folks.
[4990.66 → 4991.54] Hold out your hand
[4991.54 → 4992.28] that you might be
[4992.28 → 4993.38] the vehicle of the Spirit's
[4993.38 → 4993.76] calling,
[4994.38 → 4994.96] commissioning,
[4995.10 → 4995.74] and equipping
[4995.74 → 4996.84] as we serve.
[4997.44 → 4998.06] Please allow me
[4998.06 → 4998.64] to lead you
[4998.64 → 4999.42] in prayer.
[4999.42 → 5008.08] God,
[5008.16 → 5009.00] our Heavenly Father,
[5009.70 → 5010.80] who has called you
[5010.80 → 5012.16] to these sacred offices,
[5012.66 → 5014.12] guide you by His Word,
[5014.54 → 5016.14] equip you with His Spirit,
[5016.48 → 5018.46] and so prosper your ministries
[5018.46 → 5020.68] that His church may increase
[5020.68 → 5023.84] and His name may be praised.
[5024.58 → 5026.24] In Jesus Christ we pray.
[5027.24 → 5027.54] Amen.
[5029.42 → 5031.88] You may be seated.
[5032.02 → 5032.56] Thank you, guys.
[5032.56 → 5032.62] Thank you.
[5045.62 → 5046.74] As you are seated,
[5046.94 → 5048.50] I'm going to address
[5048.50 → 5049.52] each of you
[5049.52 → 5052.16] from the stage
[5052.16 → 5053.10] and for the elders
[5053.10 → 5056.12] who are continuing in service
[5056.12 → 5057.46] and the deacons
[5057.46 → 5058.66] who are continuing in service,
[5058.66 → 5061.58] this charge also applies to you.
[5062.98 → 5064.46] So I charge you,
[5064.86 → 5065.16] elders,
[5065.82 → 5067.56] as shepherds of the flock,
[5068.04 → 5069.12] to hold firmly
[5069.12 → 5070.60] to the trustworthy message
[5070.60 → 5071.86] as it has been taught
[5071.86 → 5074.30] so that you can encourage others
[5074.30 → 5075.52] by sound doctrine
[5075.52 → 5077.12] and refute those
[5077.12 → 5077.88] who oppose it.
[5079.18 → 5080.12] Be a friend
[5080.12 → 5081.96] and a Christ-like example
[5081.96 → 5082.56] to children.
[5083.60 → 5084.20] Give clear
[5084.20 → 5085.42] and cheerful guidance
[5085.42 → 5086.22] to young people.
[5086.22 → 5087.98] By word
[5087.98 → 5088.90] and by example,
[5088.90 → 5090.56] bear up God's people
[5090.56 → 5091.16] in pain
[5091.16 → 5091.96] and weakness
[5091.96 → 5092.84] and celebrate
[5092.84 → 5094.00] joys with them.
[5095.28 → 5096.32] Hold in trust
[5096.32 → 5097.68] all sensitive matters
[5097.68 → 5098.98] confided to you.
[5100.20 → 5101.54] Encourage the aged
[5101.54 → 5102.62] to persevere
[5102.62 → 5103.64] in God's promises
[5103.64 → 5105.78] and be wise counsellors
[5105.78 → 5106.60] who support
[5106.60 → 5107.70] and strengthen
[5107.70 → 5108.56] the pastors.
[5109.52 → 5110.50] Be compassionate
[5110.50 → 5111.78] yet firm
[5111.78 → 5112.86] and consistent
[5112.86 → 5113.92] in rebuke
[5113.92 → 5114.90] and discipline.
[5116.40 → 5117.26] Know the scriptures
[5117.26 → 5118.60] which are useful
[5118.60 → 5119.22] for teaching,
[5119.40 → 5119.78] rebuking,
[5119.94 → 5120.26] correcting,
[5120.42 → 5120.88] and training
[5120.88 → 5121.96] in righteousness.
[5122.64 → 5123.60] Pray continually
[5123.60 → 5124.76] for the church.
[5124.96 → 5126.16] Remember at all times
[5126.16 → 5126.96] that if you would
[5126.96 → 5127.68] truly give
[5127.68 → 5128.56] spiritual leadership
[5128.56 → 5129.24] in the household
[5129.24 → 5129.70] of faith,
[5129.84 → 5130.64] you must be
[5130.64 → 5131.90] completely mastered
[5131.90 → 5133.24] by your Lord.
[5133.24 → 5133.28] Lord,
[5133.80 → 5137.06] I charge you deacons
[5137.06 → 5138.92] to inspire
[5138.92 → 5140.10] faithful ministries
[5140.10 → 5140.76] of service
[5140.76 → 5141.40] to one another,
[5142.06 → 5143.48] to the larger community
[5143.48 → 5144.94] and to the world.
[5146.00 → 5146.94] Remind us
[5146.94 → 5147.62] that the Lord
[5147.62 → 5148.42] requires us
[5148.42 → 5149.54] to act justly,
[5149.64 → 5150.78] to love mercy,
[5150.92 → 5151.96] and to walk humbly
[5151.96 → 5153.12] with our God.
[5154.00 → 5154.78] Teach us
[5154.78 → 5155.52] to be merciful
[5155.52 → 5156.38] and to seize
[5156.38 → 5157.24] new opportunities
[5157.24 → 5158.62] to worship God
[5158.62 → 5159.66] with offerings
[5159.66 → 5160.28] of wealth
[5160.28 → 5161.02] and time
[5161.02 → 5161.66] and ability.
[5161.66 → 5163.78] realize that
[5163.78 → 5164.46] benevolence
[5164.46 → 5165.28] is a quality
[5165.28 → 5166.04] of our life
[5166.04 → 5166.54] in Christ
[5166.54 → 5167.46] and not merely
[5167.46 → 5168.00] a matter
[5168.00 → 5169.30] of financial assistance.
[5170.56 → 5170.86] Therefore,
[5171.14 → 5172.04] minister to the rich
[5172.04 → 5173.64] and poor alike,
[5173.78 → 5174.34] both within
[5174.34 → 5175.12] and outside
[5175.12 → 5176.26] of this church.
[5177.78 → 5179.06] Weigh our opportunities
[5179.06 → 5179.82] for giving
[5179.82 → 5180.54] and service
[5180.54 → 5182.00] and use the church's
[5182.00 → 5183.46] resources discerningly.
[5184.50 → 5185.26] Be compassionate
[5185.26 → 5186.46] to those in need
[5186.46 → 5187.08] and treat them
[5187.08 → 5187.60] with dignity
[5187.60 → 5188.42] and respect.
[5188.86 → 5189.66] Hold and trust
[5189.66 → 5190.82] all sensitive matters
[5190.82 → 5191.86] confided to you
[5191.86 → 5192.84] and encourage
[5192.84 → 5193.58] with words
[5193.58 → 5194.52] that create hope
[5194.52 → 5195.14] in hearts
[5195.14 → 5196.14] and with deeds
[5196.14 → 5197.08] that bring joy
[5197.08 → 5197.94] into lives.
[5198.96 → 5200.42] Be prophetic critics
[5200.42 → 5201.50] of the waste,
[5201.92 → 5202.44] injustice,
[5202.74 → 5203.64] and selfishness
[5203.64 → 5204.84] in our society
[5204.84 → 5205.98] and be sensitive
[5205.98 → 5206.56] counsellors
[5206.56 → 5207.42] to the victims
[5207.42 → 5208.34] of such evils.
[5209.30 → 5210.64] Let your lives,
[5210.84 → 5210.98] too,
[5211.10 → 5212.56] be above reproach.
[5213.24 → 5214.06] Live as examples
[5214.06 → 5215.08] of Jesus Christ.
[5215.52 → 5216.46] Look to the interests
[5216.46 → 5217.00] of others
[5217.00 → 5217.98] and in all
[5217.98 → 5218.82] your ministries.
[5218.98 → 5219.54] Help us
[5219.54 → 5220.36] to participate
[5220.36 → 5221.88] in all things,
[5222.04 → 5223.66] even as we anticipate
[5223.66 → 5224.54] its completion
[5224.54 → 5225.86] when God's kingdom
[5225.86 → 5227.16] comes in fullness.
[5229.04 → 5230.42] And to the congregation,
[5231.42 → 5233.10] I charge you,
[5233.86 → 5234.76] people of God,
[5235.10 → 5236.98] to receive these office bearers
[5236.98 → 5238.84] as Christ's gift
[5238.84 → 5239.80] to the church.
[5241.04 → 5242.30] Recognize in them
[5242.30 → 5243.32] the Lord's provision
[5243.32 → 5244.08] for healthy,
[5244.24 → 5245.70] congregational life.
[5245.70 → 5247.30] hold them in honour.
[5247.50 → 5248.48] Take their counsel
[5248.48 → 5249.52] seriously.
[5249.98 → 5250.80] Respond to them
[5250.80 → 5251.46] in obedience
[5251.46 → 5252.58] and with respect.
[5253.60 → 5254.66] Accept their help
[5254.66 → 5255.58] with thanks.
[5257.02 → 5258.28] Wholeheartedly participate
[5258.28 → 5259.16] in the ministries
[5259.16 → 5260.50] into which they lead.
[5261.66 → 5262.94] Sustain them in prayer
[5262.94 → 5264.28] and encourage them
[5264.28 → 5265.14] with your support,
[5265.28 → 5267.08] especially as they feel
[5267.08 → 5267.56] the burden
[5267.56 → 5268.80] of their office.
[5269.44 → 5270.28] Acknowledge them
[5270.28 → 5271.78] as the Lord's servant
[5271.78 → 5273.02] among you.
[5274.34 → 5275.26] And for the congregation,
[5275.26 → 5276.10] whether you are here
[5276.10 → 5276.84] or at home,
[5277.20 → 5278.00] I have a question
[5278.00 → 5278.58] for you
[5278.58 → 5279.22] as you pledge
[5279.22 → 5282.02] to support them
[5282.02 → 5282.96] in this work.
[5283.02 → 5283.52] And so I will ask
[5283.52 → 5283.92] the question
[5283.92 → 5284.58] and invite you
[5284.58 → 5285.20] to respond,
[5285.34 → 5285.96] everyone here

[5291.66 → 5292.24] congregation,
[5292.80 → 5294.14] pledge to receive
[5294.14 → 5295.68] these people
[5295.68 → 5299.12] as you have been charged
[5299.12 → 5300.90] and they have been called?
[5300.90 → 5302.32] what is your answer?
[5303.32 → 5304.06] We do,
[5304.62 → 5305.40] God helping us.
[5307.22 → 5308.56] Let's join our hearts
[5308.56 → 5309.90] in prayer together.
[5317.90 → 5319.20] Merciful Heavenly Father,
[5319.84 → 5321.14] we thank you
[5321.14 → 5322.52] that you have provided
[5322.52 → 5324.22] faithful and gifted people
[5324.22 → 5325.76] to serve as elders
[5325.76 → 5326.66] and deacons here
[5326.66 → 5327.18] at Emmanuel.
[5327.18 → 5329.90] As these new office bearers
[5329.90 → 5331.12] assume their responsibilities,
[5331.40 → 5332.80] fill them with your spirit,
[5333.24 → 5334.70] endow them with your wisdom
[5334.70 → 5336.58] and grant them strength.
[5337.54 → 5339.10] Make them faithful workers
[5339.10 → 5339.96] in your vineyard.
[5340.38 → 5341.34] Under their guidance,
[5341.46 → 5342.36] may your church grow
[5342.36 → 5344.46] in every spiritual grace,
[5344.88 → 5346.30] in faith which is open
[5346.30 → 5347.02] and unashamed
[5347.02 → 5348.22] and in the committed service
[5348.22 → 5349.56] that promotes your reign
[5349.56 → 5350.36] in the world.
[5351.40 → 5352.52] Help them to perform
[5352.52 → 5353.16] their duties
[5353.16 → 5353.98] with enthusiasm
[5353.98 → 5355.24] and humility.
[5356.80 → 5357.80] In their work,
[5357.96 → 5360.22] grant them a sustained awe
[5360.22 → 5360.92] that is rooted
[5360.92 → 5362.26] in daily adoration
[5362.26 → 5362.90] of you,
[5363.20 → 5363.62] their Lord.
[5364.94 → 5365.44] Through them,
[5365.56 → 5366.58] may your name be honoured
[5366.58 → 5368.24] and your church be served.
[5369.50 → 5370.20] Help us,
[5370.50 → 5371.02] your people,

[5374.44 → 5375.98] and respect them
[5375.98 → 5376.74] for the sake
[5376.74 → 5378.04] of your precious Son,
[5378.50 → 5379.14] our Lord,
[5379.14 → 5381.24] in whose name we pray.
[5382.46 → 5382.78] Amen.

[5389.12 → 5390.04] the blessing of God
[5390.04 → 5391.84] after which we will sing
[5391.84 → 5392.98] our closing song.
[5400.18 → 5401.22] Go this week
[5401.22 → 5403.96] as disciples of Jesus,
[5404.16 → 5405.56] hearers and doers
[5405.56 → 5406.60] of the word.
[5406.86 → 5408.34] Go with God.
[5409.34 → 5410.66] May God go before you
[5410.66 → 5411.74] to lead you.
[5411.74 → 5413.86] May God go behind you
[5413.86 → 5414.84] to guard you.
[5415.48 → 5416.72] May God go beneath you
[5416.72 → 5417.68] to support you.
[5417.80 → 5419.36] And may God go beside you
[5419.36 → 5420.48] to befriend you.
[5420.78 → 5422.82] Do not be afraid.
[5423.82 → 5425.00] Let the blessing of God
[5425.00 → 5425.98] come upon you today.
[5426.32 → 5428.18] Do not be afraid,
[5428.90 → 5431.04] but go in peace,
[5431.64 → 5432.10] to love,
[5432.58 → 5433.98] and serve the Lord.

[5435.64 → 5435.82] Amen.

[5573.30 → 5575.30] Thank you.
[5575.30 → 5577.30] Thank you.
[5577.30 → 5579.30] Thank you.
[5579.30 → 5581.30] Thank you.
[5581.30 → 5583.30] Thank you.
[5583.30 → 5597.68] Forever you are faithful, forever you are strong, forever you are with us, forever, forever.
[5613.30 → 5643.28] We worship the God who is our God.
[5643.30 → 5646.56] We worship the God who is.
[5646.72 → 5650.88] We worship the God who evermore will be.
[5651.92 → 5654.76] He opened the prison doors.
[5655.28 → 5657.54] He parted the raging sea.
[5658.18 → 5661.66] My God, He holds the victory.
[5664.14 → 5666.88] Let's join the house of the Lord.
[5667.18 → 5669.70] Let's join the house of the Lord today.
[5669.70 → 5672.30] And we won't be quiet.
[5673.00 → 5675.36] We shout out your praise.
[5675.62 → 5678.04] Let's join the house of the Lord.
[5678.46 → 5681.60] Our God is shining in this place.
[5681.82 → 5683.46] And we won't be quiet.
[5683.46 → 5686.76] We shout out your praise.
[5686.76 → 5692.68] Oh, we shout our praise
[5692.68 → 5699.56] We sing to the God who heals
[5699.56 → 5702.38] We sing to the God who saves
[5702.38 → 5706.74] We sing to the God who always makes a way
[5706.74 → 5710.72] Because He hung up on that cross
[5710.72 → 5713.54] Then He rose up from that grave
[5713.54 → 5718.70] My God's still Rolling Stones away
[5718.70 → 5722.72] There's joy in the house of the Lord
[5722.72 → 5725.74] There's joy in the house of the Lord today
[5725.74 → 5728.08] And we won't be quiet
[5728.08 → 5731.18] We shout out your praise
[5731.18 → 5733.90] There's joy in the house of the Lord
[5733.90 → 5737.44] Our God is surely in this place
[5737.44 → 5739.30] And we won't be quiet
[5739.30 → 5742.68] We shout out your praise
[5742.68 → 5749.26] We were the beggars
[5749.26 → 5751.70] Now we're royalty
[5751.70 → 5754.26] We were the presents
[5754.26 → 5757.64] Now we're running free
[5757.64 → 5763.42] We are forgiven, accepted, redeemed by His grace
[5763.42 → 5767.90] Let the house of the Lord sing praise
[5767.90 → 5771.28] Because we were the beggars
[5771.28 → 5774.48] Now we're royalty
[5774.48 → 5776.64] We were the prisoners
[5776.64 → 5780.16] Now we're running free
[5780.16 → 5781.92] We are forgiven
