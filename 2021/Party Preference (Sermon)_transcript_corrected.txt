[0.00 → 6.68] as we begin here uh this morning I just want to uh before we jump into the text just take a moment
[6.68 → 15.20] uh and say to you all here present and to you uh watching happy covidversary uh it has been
[15.20 → 23.96] one year of covid restrictions and different versions of restrictions and the lockdown and
[23.96 → 32.64] the like uh and this has been a really strange and weird and hard and trying time for so many of us
[32.64 → 42.78] for so many different reasons and given that it's been a year now it's given pause for at least me
[42.78 → 48.54] to reflect and perhaps you as well on what has this year been like
[48.54 → 57.92] I'm starting to wonder about the question as Christians in the world today when everything
[57.92 → 64.08] else is different because of covid what makes us different
[64.08 → 72.42] so when everything else is already different and changed how do we as Christians stand out
[72.42 → 77.80] for the glory of god and the revealing of his kingdom come and his kingdom coming
[77.80 → 88.28] and I think it really begs the question when the world outside the church when those people
[88.28 → 94.60] who do not profess to be Christian when they look at us as Christians what do they see
[94.60 → 103.16] and in the face of covid and all the anxieties around that do they see peace in the face of
[103.16 → 107.80] restrictions and ongoing restrictions do they see humility
[107.80 → 119.80] in the face of hardship and loneliness do they see a community that comes together in unique and
[119.80 → 126.72] trying and special ways to bring encouragement and life and support when everything is different
[126.72 → 130.72] what makes us different
[130.72 → 134.96] and so happy anniversary
[134.96 → 139.76] think about that question as we come to jams
[139.76 → 143.04] this morning because jams
[143.04 → 146.76] is asking us that very question
[146.76 → 148.40] what makes you
[148.40 → 149.60] different
[149.60 → 153.20] this morning we're going to read from jams 2
[153.20 → 155.60] we're going to read verse 1 through 13
[155.60 → 161.76] really do encourage you to have a bible in your hand or on your phone or whatever device you are using
[161.76 → 166.96] have that up pull it up have it beside you, it will be on the screen as we go through it, but we'll
[166.96 → 169.52] jump back and actually jump around a little bit
[170.32 → 170.72] morning
[170.72 → 173.60] so jams 2
[173.60 → 184.88] my brothers and sisters believers in our glorious lord Jesus Christ must not show favouritism
[186.96 → 194.48] suppose a man comes into your meetings wearing a gold ring and fine clothes and a poor man in filthy old
[194.48 → 195.84] clothes also comes in
[197.20 → 203.44] if you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say here's a good seat for you
[203.60 → 210.40] but say to the poor man you stand here or sit on the floor by my feet
[211.12 → 216.72] have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts
[218.16 → 226.72] listen my dear brothers and sisters has no god chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith
[226.72 → 230.08] and to inherit the kingdom he promised to those who love him
[230.08 → 239.60] but you have dishonoured poor is it not the rich who are exploiting you are they not the ones who
[239.60 → 244.00] are dragging you into court are they not the ones who are blaspheming the noble name of him who is
[244.96 → 253.68] of him to whom you belong if you keep the royal law found in scripture love your neighbour as yourself you are doing right
[253.68 → 260.00] but if you show favouritism you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers
[261.68 → 267.28] whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it
[268.32 → 272.56] for he who said you shall not commit adultery also said you shall not murder
[272.56 → 282.88] if you do not commit adultery but do commit murder you have become a lawbreaker speak and act as those who
[282.88 → 289.84] are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom because judgment without mercy will be shown to
[289.84 → 299.12] anyone who has not been merciful mercy triumphs over judgment this is the word of the lord
[299.12 → 315.20] sore churchyard is a 19th century Danish philosopher and theologian, and he says
[316.32 → 325.12] the human race in the course of time has taken the liberty of softening Christianity until at least we
[325.12 → 332.16] have contrived to make it exactly the opposite of what it was in the New Testament
[335.20 → 342.64] in jams 1 verse 27 and pastor Kevin led us in this last week he writes religion that god our father
[342.64 → 350.40] accepts as pure and faultless is this, and then he goes to keep oneself from being polluted by the world
[350.40 → 358.40] and we've seen it here in this series before right that the jams is calling us to holiness
[359.36 → 367.20] and holiness is defined as being set apart from the rest of the world holiness is going against the grain
[367.20 → 374.48] as pastor Kevin said last week holiness is going against the current of the western story
[374.48 → 383.52] right because we are being pulled along and shaped in ways that we don't even realize and as Christians we have to learn
[383.52 → 388.64] first how to stand against that tide and then how to walk upstream
[390.56 → 396.88] but the sad truth is that most of us don't really want to learn
[396.88 → 403.04] it's too much work right we say things like life is already too hard
[404.16 → 409.60] going full well that that's just an excuse to stand in our apathy or to be carried away
[411.28 → 418.72] I once heard someone say that everything we do to increase our security and comfort
[418.72 → 426.16] that's the goal of the western story and as Christians believing in the west as those who
[426.16 → 432.16] profess to be Christians in the west right in our comfortable and progressive society of Canada
[432.16 → 436.72] we are just as guilty of living that reality
[438.72 → 445.68] one of my uh most loved writers a pastor and theologian by the name of David plat the says
[445.68 → 456.48] we want Christianity, and we want church on our terms according to our preferences aligning with our
[456.48 → 463.20] lifestyles we are a people happy to go to church just as long as nothing in our lives has to change
[466.16 → 472.56] Martin Luther in the 16th century said a religion that gives nothing costs anything and suffers nothing
[472.56 → 476.08] is worth nothing
[476.08 → 483.92] carl Bart theologian 20th century said the word became flesh and then through theologians it became words again
[487.44 → 495.20] in this series in the book of jams we are challenging each other god is speaking into our
[495.20 → 506.24] lives challenging us to make our faith more than words we want to be hearers and doers we want to make
[506.24 → 518.72] our faith real and to live lives out of that new reality after two jams shows us another one of the ways to do that
[518.72 → 527.36] so right here at the beginning I want to show you sort of my thesis right what I believe that jams is
[527.36 → 534.88] encouraging us to and to do that we're going to sort of pull on three verses from the text, and we're going
[534.88 → 540.40] to limit ourselves this morning to those three verses and so with your bibles look at verse one
[540.40 → 549.28] jams writes my brothers and sisters believers in our glorious lord Jesus Christ must not show favouritism
[551.28 → 560.00] and then jams gives some examples of what that might look like and then in verses five through seven
[560.00 → 566.88] he gets some questions that start to reveal why and how god's kingdom economic looks a little bit different
[566.88 → 574.16] and then in verse eight and nine we read if you really keep the royal law found in scripture love your
[574.16 → 583.68] neighbour as yourself you are doing right but if you show favouritism you sin and are convicted by the law
[584.32 → 596.32] as lawbreakers, and it is this thread that I want to pull on with you today right the thread that runs
[596.32 → 606.40] through love your neighbour as yourself and connects that to not showing favouritism let me put it like this
[606.96 → 615.20] jams is connecting here right the second of the greatest commandments to love your neighbour as
[615.20 → 623.36] yourself he is connecting that with this idea of not showing favouritism so one of the ways that we
[623.36 → 629.76] don't show favouritism is by loving our neighbour whoever that may be now there's a logical structure
[629.76 → 633.60] to the point that I'm making here, and it might be hard to follow, and so I've got this image that we're
[633.60 → 639.20] going to put on screen in just a second here that's going to help you sort of see the steps of this point
[639.20 → 645.92] that I'm making, and you can follow the steps as that appears on-screen and as you see it on screen
[645.92 → 653.44] there just know that lane that l-y-n-a is an acronym for love your neighbour as yourself so when I say lane
[653.44 → 661.12] I'm saying love your neighbour as yourself so first lane is equal to not showing favouritism
[663.44 → 669.92] and since lane is also equal to not being about yourself that is selflessness
[669.92 → 677.60] therefore by the transitive property or if you've studied logic the law of syllogism
[677.60 → 686.32] right selflessness is not showing favouritism and then so to say it without the negation to say
[686.32 → 694.64] positively we can conclude that favouritism is ultimately a form of selfish yes
[694.64 → 700.96] now I get that that might appear complicated and that not everyone follows this sort of
[701.60 → 705.44] logical syllogistic structures in the way that they want so let me put it another way because
[705.44 → 711.36] I really do want you to see this morning and so if you have your bibles I want you to jump to
[711.36 → 716.96] Philippians 2. now if you don't Philippians is a couple books before jams and so just flip
[716.96 → 721.68] to the left as it were or type it in your search bar Philippians 2.
[721.68 → 730.48] now uh two things before I read into this first Philippians is one of my favourite books in
[730.48 → 734.80] the bible and so when I'm looking to make a point you will learn that I probably end up back in
[734.80 → 739.84] Philippians pretty regularly two I think this is particularly pertinent for us because I know
[739.84 → 745.52] there's a bible study or two that is from our church studying Philippians right now and so all
[745.52 → 749.12] these things are coming together in the work of the spirit Philippians 2
[751.44 → 756.00] Paul there writes saying if you have any encouragement for being united with Christ
[756.00 → 760.16] any comfort from his love if any common sharing in the spirit if any tenderness
[760.16 → 766.32] and compassion really what he is saying there is if you are Christian if you are part of this
[766.32 → 771.92] fellowship of believers the body of Christ if that is you then make my joy complete by being
[771.92 → 775.92] like-minded and having the same love being one in spirit and of one mind and here it is
[776.48 → 787.04] do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit rather in humility value others above yourselves
[787.04 → 795.84] not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of others then we get this beautiful
[795.84 → 803.92] picture of what that looks like and that looks like Jesus all right Paul continues in your relationship
[803.92 → 809.68] with one another have the same mindset as Christ Jesus who being in very nature god did not consider
[809.68 → 815.36] equality with god something to be used for his own advantage rather he made himself nothing taking on the
[815.36 → 820.32] very nature of a servant being made in human likeness and being found in appearance as a man he humbled
[820.32 → 827.84] himself and became obedient to death even death on the cross and here's where I want you to go next
[827.84 → 835.44] look at verse 14 do everything without grumbling or arguing
[838.24 → 844.96] so do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit rather in humility consider every value others above
[844.96 → 848.88] yourselves not looking to your own interests but to each of you to the interests of others and then
[848.88 → 858.16] verse 14 that attitude of being like Jesus that attitude of humility manifests itself in doing everything
[858.16 → 861.84] without grumbling or arguing
[864.80 → 875.12] grumbling comes from selfishness right I should get better I should be treated better I should have better
[875.12 → 883.68] this should be easier or whatever form your grumbling takes right arguing comes from selfishness you need
[883.68 → 891.68] to see it my way and if you just saw it my way boy this all just be easier for me anyway
[892.96 → 900.72] right likewise with favouritism we treat certain others better because we believe they will give us more
[900.72 → 906.40] more that they will have a greater benefit to me right that I will get more out of this relationship
[906.40 → 913.04] than I will out of that relationship so I'm going to focus my attention my efforts here we favour others
[913.04 → 919.04] because we believe that they are safer or because they're less likely to make us uncomfortable
[920.16 → 924.24] remember that idea that we do everything to be comfortable and safe
[924.24 → 935.92] that's favouritism in jams the word that he uses uh in Greek or favouritism when he says believers in
[935.92 → 941.36] our glorious lord Jesus Christ must not show favouritism that word favouritism literally means
[941.36 → 948.32] to receive according to the face or to lift someone's face and the idea behind that word image
[948.32 → 953.76] right is that we exalt someone, or we make much of them we treat them differently or with more respect
[953.76 → 958.72] because of their face because of the way that they look literally or because of the way that they
[958.72 → 965.52] look in society right this person has power this person has status, and so I'm going to treat them
[965.52 → 974.40] differently right favouritism is to make judgments based on external appearance on superficial realities
[974.40 → 982.00] and judging a person prejudicing them because of these superficial realities is not in any way
[982.00 → 991.12] how you love your neighbour that's what jams is now in jams particular context it was about the wealthy
[991.12 → 996.88] and the poor right and in a society uh that thought the wealthy were wealthy because they were being
[996.88 → 1005.36] rewarded by god and blessed by god Jesus comes and says blessed are the poor in a society that understood
[1005.36 → 1012.64] power and status and the right to or as the right to rule Jesus comes and says whoever wants to be great
[1012.64 → 1019.04] among you must become the least that the last shall be first, and the first shall be last
[1020.48 → 1028.40] and we get that sort of application right in our day too, but favouritism also shows up in so many ways
[1028.40 → 1036.08] in our lives we make snap judgments about people for what they wear about their physical appearance
[1036.08 → 1044.24] the colour of their skin or their physical ability on and on it goes in fact neuroscientists have shown
[1044.24 → 1050.88] that it takes less than one tenth of a second to make a judgment about someone based solely on what
[1050.88 → 1058.72] you see so much so that it can be hard for those people to actually overcome your preconceived notions
[1058.72 → 1062.72] even though you made them with literally zero real intelligence about them
[1064.96 → 1073.28] and you see it working out too right and how you can actually be surprised when your snap judgment
[1073.28 → 1078.08] and your preconceived ideas doesn't match the reality of the person in front of you once you start
[1078.08 → 1084.16] talking to them or once you get to know them and the fact that you are surprised is indicative of
[1084.16 → 1089.52] something here the fact that you are surprised is indicative of the kind of weight that we give our
[1089.52 → 1097.20] prejudices more than the reality of the person standing in front of us okay let me illustrate this
[1097.20 → 1103.76] in a really practical way and some of you are going to be probably made uncomfortable
[1103.76 → 1110.32] and by this and I want to encourage you to live in that uncomfortability for a moment
[1112.16 → 1119.12] so let's say it's your first day at a new job or at school or whatever and lunch comes up, and it's
[1119.12 → 1126.24] time to go into the lunchroom walking into the lunchroom you see a group of people who are ethnically
[1126.24 → 1133.68] like you and a group of people who are ethnically different than you each at their own table and
[1133.68 → 1141.84] what do you instinctively do you move towards the group of people that are like you in one tenth of
[1141.84 → 1148.48] one second you've made a decision but why, or you don't know anything about either one of those groups
[1149.36 → 1154.64] and look I don't want to oversimplify it and if you're listening to this, and you are beginning that
[1154.64 → 1159.12] justification train already if you're starting to justify what you would do and why you would do it
[1159.12 → 1163.52] what about this or what about this, or you don't know this part of the story of course I did that
[1166.08 → 1172.00] be aware because you in oversimplifying might be finding trying to find a way to
[1172.00 → 1177.28] not be convicted by what we're saying here but again I don't want to oversimplify it but really simply
[1177.28 → 1183.28] at the speed of thought in that one tenth of one second in your brain this happens you walk in
[1183.28 → 1187.52] you see that one group is like you, and you see that one group is not and your brain says that
[1187.52 → 1192.72] group that is like me is safer, and therefore they are more comfortable and that more comfortable means
[1192.72 → 1198.80] that there's more for me to gain and then the group that is not like me is not safe and therefore
[1198.80 → 1203.20] not comfortable and since they are not safe nor comfortable then I have nothing to gain
[1203.20 → 1213.60] it is to that sort of subconscious and pre-conscious way of acting and thinking in the world that jams
[1213.60 → 1225.36] and Jesus says no believers in our glorious lord Jesus Christ will not act that way and look I know
[1225.36 → 1231.20] that most of us probably all of us will say that we wouldn't show favouritism like that, or we shouldn't
[1231.20 → 1239.28] show favouritism like that especially in that kind of example, and yet I also know every one of us does
[1242.64 → 1249.84] and it goes deeper still and not only are we guilty of showing favouritism we are guilty of assuming we
[1249.84 → 1256.96] deserve favouritism if we deserve preferential treatment because of some sort of external realities
[1256.96 → 1268.40] I can't tell you how many times I hear something like I have been part of this group be at a church or
[1268.40 → 1275.52] anything else doesn't matter what for so long I deserve this, or you should the expectation is you
[1275.52 → 1282.56] should listen to me more right um I don't know all of you as well as I would like to yet and so you're
[1282.56 → 1287.68] probably not like this um he says as a caveat knowing that you probably are
[1290.80 → 1300.08] you see this with people who start churches charter members people who literally built this place with
[1300.08 → 1304.16] their own hands where if you looked closely enough you would find their blood stains on the walls
[1304.16 → 1307.84] somewhere because they are volunteers, and they don't know how to use a hammer but still they did it
[1307.84 → 1316.80] they say I've been here for 34 years since the beginning and what's the implication you haven't put the
[1316.80 → 1326.72] same kind of time in that I have my opinion matters more my desire matters more or people
[1328.88 → 1336.00] will say things like everything we do we only ever do for the young people
[1336.00 → 1343.76] what's the implication start taking me more seriously or young people say everything we do
[1343.76 → 1348.08] the only thing we ever do is for all the old people that's an interesting dynamic itself right
[1348.72 → 1356.40] but what's the implication I deserve more and here's the reality of course every one of these groups
[1356.40 → 1361.68] deserves more, but it's not that we deserve more so much as that we deserve different we ought to be
[1361.68 → 1366.40] treating each other differently we ought to be engaging in these sorts of conversations differently
[1366.40 → 1373.84] because that's what it means to be Christian whether you are a pastor or a pauper we are the same
[1377.20 → 1385.52] and we ought to treat each other differently whether it's ethnicity or clothes whether it's employment
[1385.52 → 1393.04] or not whether it is age or gender position or title Christians must be different from the world around us
[1394.80 → 1402.64] and look in today's world there seems to be more and more polarization right we're talking about
[1402.64 → 1407.76] covid anniversary in the last year how many times have you heard that word polarized society
[1407.76 → 1416.08] right more than in the previous at least 37 years of my life that I've ever heard it and with this
[1416.08 → 1421.84] polarization comes this increased desire and temptation to sort of circle the wagons
[1423.12 → 1431.12] right to gather more and more in our closed circles and right now especially right we exist online but online
[1431.12 → 1438.80] existence is always an echo chamber but quite literally the Google algorithm that controls your
[1438.80 → 1445.60] online engine is designed to make you click further and longer and to stay engaged longer and so it is
[1445.60 → 1452.64] designed to present to you your stereotypes and your pre-existing notions so that you will go further down
[1452.64 → 1458.32] that rabbit hole and so what ends up happening is that circle of wagons just gets tighter and tighter and
[1458.32 → 1462.64] tighter and that echo chamber just gets smaller and smaller and smaller and all of a sudden we're not
[1462.64 → 1469.12] listening to any different voices or hearing any other perspectives because other people's ideas make me
[1469.12 → 1478.24] uncomfortable other people challenge my status quo and whether we recognize it or not we have carefully
[1478.24 → 1483.12] manicured our lives to increase our safety and comfort in the world
[1483.12 → 1486.24] our faith in the world
[1486.24 → 1494.88] but today if you are Christian if your faith is real that has got to stop
[1496.32 → 1508.16] let me read it again so that it is hits harder if you show favouritism you sin and are convicted by the law as
[1508.16 → 1519.60] lawbreakers favouritism is selfishness expressed and applied and selfishness is the root of all sin in your
[1519.60 → 1526.16] life favouritism disrespects people and ultimately favouritism dishonours god
[1528.24 → 1537.20] instead look at what james says to speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law
[1537.20 → 1543.52] that gives freedom mercy triumphs over judgment
[1545.36 → 1548.56] does mercy triumph over judgment in your life
[1550.72 → 1558.32] because in the gospel of Jesus mercy triumphed over judgment for your life
[1558.32 → 1569.52] the simple reality in front of us this morning is that we each one are more sinful than we could ever
[1570.08 → 1570.72] imagine
[1572.48 → 1575.52] more sinful than we would ever dare to admit
[1577.20 → 1577.76] and yet
[1579.12 → 1584.40] we are more loved than we could ever know possible
[1584.40 → 1592.80] and out of god's great love for us Jesus Christ came into the world, and he lived the life I should
[1592.80 → 1604.64] have lived, and he died the death that I deserve mercy triumphs over judgment on the cross and god now calls you out of darkness into his wonderful light
[1604.64 → 1613.20] god calls you now out of the death of worldliness into new life in his kingdom and that looks different
[1613.20 → 1618.16] and it looks different because finally and maybe for the first time you are actually alive
[1619.68 → 1624.80] actually really living in Christ Jesus
[1624.80 → 1630.40] and so when you want to know what that life looks like
[1631.60 → 1638.64] but one it looks like being alive and being alive looks like mercy
[1640.16 → 1640.96] it looks different
[1642.96 → 1646.24] it's the law that gives freedom
[1646.24 → 1647.92] now
[1647.92 → 1649.76] I want to be really clear because there is
[1651.52 → 1661.28] a presumption here in jams's letter that that may not be obvious to all of us as we read through this book or as we read through many of these books but
[1661.36 → 1667.76] but notice the beginning of our text starts with believers in our glorious lord Jesus Christ jams is
[1667.76 → 1668.88] presuming
[1668.88 → 1674.88] that his readers that the people who are hearing this book just like I want to presume that you
[1674.88 → 1679.04] are already believers in our glorious lord Jesus Christ
[1679.60 → 1684.80] and that's the only reason why I want to then say this is what your life ought to look like
[1685.60 → 1692.56] because only after you have received the gracious gift of god that is faith in Christ Jesus only after
[1692.56 → 1699.76] have you been as only after that you have been raised from death into newness of life can you actually live
[1699.76 → 1710.24] this kind of life only after you have been transformed and brought into the body and the blood of Jesus Christ to be his body his bride
[1711.60 → 1712.64] can you look at the law
[1713.68 → 1715.44] and say there is
[1716.24 → 1718.24] freedom
[1720.00 → 1721.76] before that new life
[1723.20 → 1726.00] we look at the law, and we say there is burden
[1726.00 → 1727.60] there is
[1727.60 → 1734.80] there is hardship there is sin being transformed into transgression as we are made actively aware of all
[1734.80 → 1739.12] those places that we have fallen short the glory of god
[1741.92 → 1745.28] but in the power of the spirit
[1746.56 → 1755.84] in the power of new life precisely because mercy has triumphed over judgment in you and for you
[1755.84 → 1761.44] the church is made
[1762.08 → 1762.64] different
[1763.84 → 1765.28] the church must be
[1765.92 → 1766.32] different
[1767.12 → 1773.60] when it comes to race the church must be different when it comes to power and positions in society the
[1773.60 → 1779.76] church must be different Christians must be different and so when it comes to politics
[1779.76 → 1789.44] Christians must be different when it comes to people all people everywhere Christians must be different because Christians are
[1789.44 → 1791.12] different
[1795.04 → 1795.60] embrace
[1797.04 → 1797.84] your difference
[1801.04 → 1801.60] embrace
[1801.60 → 1804.24] and know
[1804.24 → 1809.04] and know what it means to be a lavishly loved child
[1809.04 → 1810.48] father
[1810.48 → 1813.28] and embrace
[1813.28 → 1816.56] what it means that all of us
[1818.56 → 1819.52] need his mercy
[1819.52 → 1822.40] and that in him
[1822.40 → 1824.64] we are all
[1824.64 → 1825.92] one
[1825.92 → 1827.12] one
[1827.12 → 1828.08] go
[1828.08 → 1830.00] and be different
[1830.64 → 1831.92] by making your faith
[1832.64 → 1832.96] real
[1835.20 → 1836.64] my prayer is that today
[1837.84 → 1839.28] and every day going forward
[1840.48 → 1841.92] when the people outside
[1842.56 → 1844.40] the church look at us
[1845.20 → 1846.48] when everything else is different
[1846.48 → 1847.68] they will see us
[1847.68 → 1850.40] they will see you
[1851.76 → 1852.48] as different
[1853.92 → 1854.32] amen
[1854.88 → 1855.60] let's pray together
[1863.04 → 1863.68] lord Jesus
[1866.16 → 1867.44] we confess to you
[1867.44 → 1871.52] that in so many areas of our lives
[1871.52 → 1873.04] in every area of our life
[1873.68 → 1878.72] we have given into the temptation to make things safer and more comfortable for us
[1879.68 → 1885.52] and we have not heard your truth when you said that in this world we will have trouble
[1888.40 → 1895.68] we've not heard the the the reality that recognizes that anyone who desires to be holy
[1895.68 → 1898.24] will be persecuted
[1901.04 → 1902.40] we've not heard the call
[1903.28 → 1904.16] to be different
[1905.92 → 1907.92] in a world of indifference
[1910.16 → 1916.72] and so lord god instead of circling the wagons we pray that you would send us out
[1918.08 → 1920.40] as ambassadors of reconciliation
[1921.44 → 1925.60] we pray that you would send us out as emissaries of your kingdom
[1925.60 → 1927.44] come and your kingdom coming
[1927.44 → 1934.64] and that when every single person looks at us, they would see something different and though
[1934.64 → 1936.32] they cannot understand it
[1937.52 → 1940.56] though it might even offend their sensibilities
[1942.24 → 1943.36] may they be convicted
[1943.36 → 1944.96] by who you are
[1944.96 → 1946.96] and what you are doing
[1948.56 → 1952.48] open our eyes lord god to the ways that we have shown favouritism
[1953.52 → 1959.28] open our eyes lord god to the ways that we have been selfish in our living
[1959.28 → 1966.40] and by your spirit and the newness of life that you have granted to us lord Jesus servant king
[1967.44 → 1973.84] may we live as you have lived may our attitudes be the same
[1973.84 → 1985.68] in whose name is Christ Jesus in whose name we pray amen
