[1288.18 → 1290.18] happy
[1290.18 → 1292.18] some of you are a bit tired
[1292.18 → 1294.18] I can relate to that
[1294.18 → 1296.18] did you guys know that it's kind of a special day
[1296.18 → 1298.18] you might have heard that today is Mother's Day
[1298.18 → 1300.18] and maybe you've done a few special things for your mom
[1300.18 → 1302.18] or a grandma
[1302.18 → 1304.18] or somebody special in your life
[1304.18 → 1306.18] which is exciting
[1306.18 → 1308.18] so today my kids did something really special for me
[1308.18 → 1310.18] they took all the time away
[1310.18 → 1312.18] that I would have to decide what to wear
[1312.18 → 1314.18] and they picked out all of my clothes
[1314.18 → 1318.18] so you can tell that I'm dressed much better than I normally am
[1318.18 → 1320.18] I have all sorts of colours on
[1320.18 → 1322.18] and more than one necklace
[1322.18 → 1324.18] and they even thought about my cold feet
[1324.18 → 1326.18] my feet are always cold
[1326.18 → 1328.18] so they gave me
[1328.18 → 1330.18] I don't know if you can see this at home
[1330.18 → 1332.18] but they gave me socks to wear underneath my sandals
[1332.18 → 1334.18] so this is why I look so nice today
[1334.18 → 1338.18] now I have a little tip for anybody who is looking for compliments
[1338.18 → 1340.18] which is probably everyone
[1340.18 → 1342.18] because we like compliments
[1342.18 → 1344.18] but if you want compliments
[1344.18 → 1346.18] and this is for anyone not just mothers
[1346.18 → 1348.18] anybody can do this you just have to have a kid who you can invite over
[1348.18 → 1350.18] let them pick out your clothes
[1350.18 → 1354.18] because I have never had as many compliments as I had this morning from my family
[1354.18 → 1356.18] so just a little advice there
[1356.18 → 1358.18] we're going to jump right on in
[1358.18 → 1360.18] it's a new month
[1360.18 → 1362.18] and that means we have a new memory verse
[1362.18 → 1366.18] so I'm going to read it out for everybody first
[1366.18 → 1368.18] and just encourage anybody
[1368.18 → 1370.18] however old you are
[1370.18 → 1372.18] to join in as our community here
[1372.18 → 1376.18] in learning this verse from the book of Isaiah
[1376.18 → 1378.18] it goes like this
[1378.18 → 1380.18] for I am the Lord your God
[1380.18 → 1382.18] who takes hold of your right hand
[1382.18 → 1384.18] and says to you
[1384.18 → 1385.18] do not fear
[1385.18 → 1387.18] I will help you
[1387.18 → 1390.18] Isaiah 41 verse 13
[1390.18 → 1392.18] so let's learn some actions
[1392.18 → 1394.18] because that might help us remember
[1394.18 → 1396.18] so do them along with me
[1396.18 → 1398.18] they're not too hard this time
[1398.18 → 1399.18] it goes like this
[1399.18 → 1400.18] some of them we've done before
[1400.18 → 1403.18] so I am the Lord your God
[1403.18 → 1406.18] who takes hold of your right hand
[1406.18 → 1408.18] and says to you
[1408.18 → 1410.18] do not fear
[1410.18 → 1412.18] I will help you
[1412.18 → 1414.18] Isaiah 41 verse 13
[1414.18 → 1415.18] now some of those are
[1415.18 → 1417.18] what we call American Sign Language
[1417.18 → 1420.18] that's a language that people speak using hand actions
[1420.18 → 1421.18] so this one here
[1421.18 → 1422.18] fear
[1422.18 → 1424.18] this is how you do fear in sign language
[1424.18 → 1425.18] and help
[1425.18 → 1427.18] you want to stick your thumb up
[1427.18 → 1429.18] and on your other hand resting
[1429.18 → 1431.18] and then pull it towards your chest
[1431.18 → 1433.18] so that is
[1433.18 → 1434.18] I will help you
[1434.18 → 1436.18] we're going to work on that for the rest of the month
[1436.18 → 1439.18] if anybody wants a photo card
[1439.18 → 1441.18] there are a few of these at the church
[1441.18 → 1444.18] and you can also find the image in the midweek memo
[1444.18 → 1446.18] or the bulletin when it goes out
[1447.18 → 1450.18] alright so we're going to jump right into our story today
[1450.18 → 1453.18] our story today comes from two books of the Bible
[1453.18 → 1455.18] we're going to start in the book of Matthew
[1455.18 → 1458.18] and then we're going to move into a book called Acts
[1458.18 → 1459.18] and you guys probably remember
[1459.18 → 1461.18] besides last week we had a little interlude
[1461.18 → 1465.18] where Mrs. Wendy was here to share with us the story of Joseph
[1465.18 → 1468.18] but before that we've been learning about the life of Jesus
[1468.18 → 1470.18] so in our story today
[1470.18 → 1473.18] it's the very end of Jesus' time on earth
[1473.18 → 1476.18] and the story is called Jesus' Ascension
[1476.18 → 1477.18] now I'm wondering if
[1477.18 → 1479.18] does anyone know what Ascension means?
[1479.18 → 1481.18] you guys know what that means?
[1481.18 → 1485.18] it basically means to rise up higher
[1485.18 → 1487.18] to rise up to a different level
[1487.18 → 1491.18], so can you think about some ways that you can make yourself rise up?
[1491.18 → 1493.18] name them out loud
[1493.18 → 1495.18] what are some things that you could do to rise up?
[1495.18 → 1498.18] so that's right you could jump
[1498.18 → 1499.18] you guys try that right now
[1499.18 → 1500.18] you can jump
[1500.18 → 1501.18] that brings you higher
[1501.18 → 1502.18] and then you come down
[1502.18 → 1503.18] but it does bring you higher
[1503.18 → 1504.18] what else could you do?
[1504.18 → 1506.18] so I was trying to think of what do I do to get higher
[1506.18 → 1510.18] and in my house I usually need to reach things that I can't
[1510.18 → 1514.18] so I often have to stand on a chair or a stool to reach something
[1514.18 → 1518.18] or sometimes when my kids can't get something I can lift them up to help them
[1518.18 → 1520.18] and those are some different ways we rise up
[1520.18 → 1524.18] you've maybe been in an airplane or climbed a flight of stairs
[1524.18 → 1527.18] all of those things mean that we are ascending
[1527.18 → 1529.18] we're going up to a higher level
[1529.18 → 1533.18] so in our story today we're going to learn about how Jesus did that
[1533.18 → 1537.18] and I'm going to read it to you first from the book of Matthew here
[1537.18 → 1541.18] so the Bible tells us that Jesus
[1541.18 → 1544.18] he invited his disciples to meet him on a certain mountain
[1544.18 → 1546.18] and he liked to do that when he was on earth
[1546.18 → 1548.18] they often went to mountains
[1548.18 → 1551.18] and this time he had something else very important to tell them
[1551.18 → 1555.18] just like when maybe your parent or teacher has something important to tell you
[1555.18 → 1558.18] so all the disciples were there
[1558.18 → 1560.18] Jesus came, and he spoke to them
[1560.18 → 1562.18] he told them something important
[1562.18 → 1563.18] this is what he said
[1563.18 → 1567.18] he said you must go and make disciples of all nations
[1567.18 → 1572.18] baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
[1572.18 → 1576.18] and teach them to obey everything I have commanded you
[1576.18 → 1581.18] and you can be sure that I am always with you to the very end
[1581.18 → 1585.18] so there are three important things Jesus said in there
[1585.18 → 1587.18] do you guys know what those are?
[1587.18 → 1590.18] what were the three important ideas that Jesus commanded them?
[1590.18 → 1591.18] I'll read it one more time
[1591.18 → 1594.18] and then maybe you can say out loud what those things are
[1594.18 → 1598.18] he said you must go and make disciples of all nations
[1598.18 → 1603.18] baptize them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
[1603.18 → 1606.18] and teach them to obey everything I have commanded you
[1606.18 → 1611.18] and you can be sure that I am always with you to the very end
[1611.18 → 1614.18] so what were those three ideas?
[1614.18 → 1616.18] I have some pictures maybe if you can't help
[1616.18 → 1617.18] can't remember here
[1617.18 → 1618.18] so the first one
[1618.18 → 1620.18] this is a picture here
[1620.18 → 1621.18] I don't know if that helps
[1621.18 → 1623.18] the first thing that Jesus said there was
[1623.18 → 1625.18] to make disciples of all nations
[1625.18 → 1630.18] so to show Jesus' love to the whole world
[1630.18 → 1632.18] so that was the first idea that he told them
[1632.18 → 1635.18] who can think of the second idea?
[1635.18 → 1638.18] we got to see a little bit of this idea
[1638.18 → 1641.18] last Sunday in church actually
[1641.18 → 1642.18] here's another picture
[1642.18 → 1644.18] you can see what that is
[1644.18 → 1645.18] the baptism
[1645.18 → 1649.18] so he instructed them to baptize people who believe in Jesus
[1649.18 → 1650.18] who love God
[1650.18 → 1652.18] so there's baptism
[1652.18 → 1653.18] and what was the third one?
[1653.18 → 1655.18] you know what the third one was?
[1655.18 → 1657.18] here's a picture of it
[1657.18 → 1661.18] he said to teach them to obey what he has commanded
[1661.18 → 1666.18] and then there was something even kind of extra cool at the end
[1666.18 → 1669.18] that Jesus promised them that he would always be with them
[1669.18 → 1671.18] to the very end
[1671.18 → 1673.18] I really like that part
[1673.18 → 1678.18] now does it kind of sound like Jesus is going somewhere do you think?
[1678.18 → 1681.18] well let's find out
[1681.18 → 1683.18] so for in the book of Acts
[1683.18 → 1685.18] this story kind of keeps going
[1685.18 → 1688.18] and it says that for 40 days after Jesus resurrected
[1688.18 → 1693.18] he kept appearing to his disciples to show them that he was really alive
[1693.18 → 1695.18] well he had a lot to tell them
[1695.18 → 1696.18] lots of instructions for them
[1696.18 → 1699.18] and he taught them more about the kingdom of God
[1700.18 → 1703.18] well one night at supper he told them something very important
[1704.18 → 1705.18] it was a bit surprising for them
[1705.18 → 1707.18] and it wasn't just a suggestion
[1707.18 → 1708.18] it was a command
[1708.18 → 1711.18] something he really wanted them to do
[1711.18 → 1712.18] and he said this
[1712.18 → 1713.18] don't leave Jerusalem
[1713.18 → 1714.18] wait
[1714.18 → 1717.18] for a gift that my father has promised you
[1717.18 → 1718.18] I've told you about it before
[1718.18 → 1721.18] John baptized people with water
[1721.18 → 1724.18] but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit
[1725.18 → 1727.18] I wonder what they thought about that
[1728.18 → 1731.18] well when they met together again the disciples had some questions
[1731.18 → 1733.18] they didn't quite understand
[1733.18 → 1734.18] so much had happened lately
[1734.18 → 1735.18] Jesus died
[1735.18 → 1736.18] then he rose again
[1736.18 → 1739.18] and then he kept just appearing to them out of nowhere
[1739.18 → 1743.18] and now he was talking about some strange and unusual gift
[1743.18 → 1745.18] so they asked Jesus
[1745.18 → 1748.18] Lord are you going to set up an earthly kingdom
[1748.18 → 1750.18] right here in Jerusalem
[1750.18 → 1753.18] well they had hoped that Jesus would be an earthly king
[1753.18 → 1755.18] to defeat all their enemies
[1755.18 → 1756.18] but Jesus said
[1756.18 → 1760.18] well no it's not time for you to know when I will come to rule the earth
[1760.18 → 1764.18] but you will receive a special power when the Holy Spirit comes on you
[1764.18 → 1766.18] you will be my witnesses
[1766.18 → 1768.18] you'll tell everyone about me
[1768.18 → 1771.18] here in Jerusalem and in all the whole world
[1771.18 → 1773.18] throughout the whole world
[1773.18 → 1775.18] well after Jesus said this
[1775.18 → 1778.18] he was taken up in the sky
[1778.18 → 1780.18] right in front of their eyes
[1780.18 → 1783.18] a cloud covered him
[1783.18 → 1786.18] and that was the last time they ever saw Jesus
[1786.18 → 1791.18] well if you were there, and you saw Jesus just rise up
[1791.18 → 1794.18] what would go through your mind
[1794.18 → 1799.18] would that be a little bit surprising that he just got taken up into the clouds
[1799.18 → 1801.18] where was he going
[1801.18 → 1802.18] was he coming back
[1802.18 → 1806.18] while the disciples were still straining their eyes looking to see Jesus
[1806.18 → 1810.18] two men suddenly dressed in white stood beside them
[1810.18 → 1811.18] and they spoke to the disciples
[1811.18 → 1812.18] they said
[1812.18 → 1813.18] men of Galilee
[1813.18 → 1815.18] why are you standing here
[1815.18 → 1817.18] why are you looking into the sky
[1817.18 → 1820.18] this same Jesus who has been taken up to heaven
[1820.18 → 1821.18] he will come back again
[1821.18 → 1825.18] and he will come back in the same way that you saw him go
[1825.18 → 1829.18] well imagine that you are a disciple
[1829.18 → 1834.18] think about all the things that you have seen and heard and learned about Jesus
[1834.18 → 1836.18] while he was on earth
[1836.18 → 1842.18] how will you explain all of that and share all of that with the people around you
[1842.18 → 1846.18] well Jesus left us this job to do too
[1846.18 → 1847.18] not just the disciples
[1847.18 → 1849.18] to teach others about him
[1849.18 → 1851.18] to share his love of the world
[1851.18 → 1853.18] to baptize people
[1853.18 → 1858.18] and he promises that he will be with us always to the very end
[1858.18 → 1861.18] let's join together and pray
[1862.18 → 1865.18] Lord Jesus thank you for your life on earth
[1865.18 → 1869.18] thank you for showing us what it means to love and teach and obey
[1869.18 → 1875.18] God please give us courage and strength to share your love to our community around us
[1875.18 → 1877.18] our families our friends our neighbours
[1877.18 → 1879.18] and thank you that you promise to be with us
[1879.18 → 1881.18] that you answer our questions
[1881.18 → 1884.18] and that you show us your love each day
[1884.18 → 1885.18] Amen

[2180.18 → 2186.18] you are the author of our salvation, and we thank you for the gift of your son

[2219.18 → 2223.18] and we ask that this day may be a day of rest in you
[2223.18 → 2227.18] help us to trust in you for everything that we need
[2227.18 → 2233.18] Father on this Sunday we'd like to take time to appreciate and celebrate our mothers
[2233.18 → 2243.18] we thank you for our mothers and the countless ways that they have and continue to demonstrate their unconditional love and their grace to us
[2244.18 → 2250.18] we thank you for the ways in which our mothers have and continue to nurture us and point us to you
[2250.18 → 2258.18] we ask for your blessing on our mothers and pray that they may reflect the glory of Christ in all that they do
[2258.18 → 2262.18] strengthen and encourage them in all of their endeavours
[2262.18 → 2269.18] and we ask that we may be a blessing to them by honouring them and by bringing joy to them
[2269.18 → 2279.18] be with those who are grieving the loss of a mother or those who didn't have a loving or nurturing mother or were unable to be a mother
[2279.18 → 2281.18] Father where such pain exists
[2282.18 → 2286.18] please grant your peace and be a comforting presence to them
[2287.18 → 2290.18] Father we thank you for this congregation
[2290.18 → 2296.18] and the ways that it has shown your love as expressed by the Dolmans
[2297.18 → 2300.18] and just thank you for the opportunity to do that
[2300.18 → 2304.18] and we ask that you continue to strengthen us as a congregation
[2305.18 → 2310.18] so that we may encourage and bless one another on an ongoing basis and in all that we do
[2311.18 → 2317.18] thank you for those who are involved in making weekly worship happen
[2317.18 → 2320.18] we also ask for your blessing on the leadership of this church
[2321.18 → 2322.18] grant them wisdom
[2323.18 → 2328.18] and we also ask for your blessing on the nomination process for office bearers
[2331.18 → 2335.18] Father we have been dealing with the effects of COVID for a little over a year
[2336.18 → 2342.18] and we acknowledge that all creation is your hand in your hand including this virus
[2342.18 → 2347.18] and so we ask you for recovery for those that have contracted it
[2348.18 → 2352.18] strength for medical folks who treat the effects of it
[2353.18 → 2360.18] and wisdom for those who develop and deliver vaccines and therapies to counteract it
[2361.18 → 2365.18] be with those who have had their surgeries cancelled
[2366.18 → 2368.18] and grant them peace as they have to wait
[2368.18 → 2371.18] can be very frustrating and just be near to them Lord
[2372.18 → 2376.18] we ask that our hospitals may be able to resume normal operations soon
[2377.18 → 2379.18] bless all who are shut in
[2380.18 → 2383.18] or can't see family due to restrictions on gathering
[2384.18 → 2389.18] and in some cases Lord they experience sadness loneliness
[2390.18 → 2392.18] even depression and anxiety as a result
[2392.18 → 2394.18] walk beside them each day
[2395.18 → 2396.18] and help them
[2397.18 → 2398.18] and us
[2399.18 → 2400.18] as our brothers and sisters in Christ
[2401.18 → 2403.18] help us to minister to them in meaningful
[2404.18 → 2405.18] and
[2406.18 → 2407.18] meaningful ways Lord
[2408.18 → 2409.18] Father we thank you for your word
[2410.18 → 2411.18] which guides our path
[2412.18 → 2413.18] bless the reading of it
[2414.18 → 2416.18] and bless Pastor Chris with the rich measure of your Holy Spirit
[2417.18 → 2418.18] as he brings your word to us
[2418.18 → 2421.18] we pray that we will take the words to heart
[2422.18 → 2423.18] and cause us to be a blessing to all of those around us
[2424.18 → 2425.18] we ask it in Jesus name
[2426.18 → 2427.18] amen
[2428.18 → 2429.18] as we open God's word together
[2430.18 → 2432.18] we're going to read from Acts 1
[2432.18 → 2433.18] and we're going to read Acts 1 and then verse 1 through 11
[2433.18 → 2434.18] and so I invite you of course to grab a Bible
[2435.18 → 2445.18] or turn on your device or wherever it is that you keep God's word and get flipped to Acts 1 there
[2446.18 → 2449.18] before we being let me just say a little bit of a Bible
[2449.18 → 2452.18] род or turn on your Bible
[2452.18 → 2454.18] or whatever it is that you keep it something on the Bible
[2457.18 → 2458.18] but your word is going to be expected than the church very often
[2459.18 → 2460.18] possible
[2460.18 → 2462.18] to complete their 12 hundred years
[2462.18 → 2464.18] but your word is missing important
[2464.18 → 2465.18] so yeah
[2466.18 → 2468.52] that dude is самой
[2469.18 → 2470.34] tell me to you
[2471.18 → 2473.18] tic shotgun
[2474.18 → 2475.18] 2
[2475.18 → 2479.94] Nikki did children's time. She talked about Jesus appearing to the disciples over a period of 40
[2479.94 → 2485.26] days after the resurrection, and you're trying to quickly count the days, and you're like, wait a
[2485.26 → 2490.62] minute, it's not 40 days since Easter Sunday. What's going on? And you would be right. And so
[2490.62 → 2497.74] Ascension Day is actually this coming Thursday, but we are celebrating that here on Sunday together
[2497.74 → 2504.14] in our worship prior to that Thursday, because this is the time that we have to gather and
[2504.14 → 2511.26] remember. And so Ascension Day is on Thursday. That is 40 days after the resurrection of Jesus, and
[2511.26 → 2519.88] in our worship today, we remember what it is that, what it means for us that Jesus went up to heaven,
[2519.88 → 2527.14] and in our broader church tradition and history, in the liturgy of the year, Ascension Day is often
[2527.14 → 2533.70] used to reflect the sort of kingship of Jesus as he ascends to the right hand of God the Father,
[2534.14 → 2542.46] and he sits on his throne of grace in heaven. With that quick explanation, let's read the story
[2542.46 → 2548.38] once again and hear it as we can find it in Acts 1, starting in verse 1.
[2548.38 → 2560.62] In my former book, Theophilus, so Luke writes this book, and he's writing it to someone named Theophilus. He
[2560.62 → 2565.84] also wrote the Gospel of Luke. This two sort of come together as one. He says, in my former book,
[2565.98 → 2573.20] Theophilus, I wrote all about all that Jesus began to do and to teach until the day he was taken up to
[2573.20 → 2579.66] heaven after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen. After his
[2579.66 → 2585.62] suffering, he presented himself to them and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared
[2585.62 → 2591.90] to them over a period of 40 days and spoke about the kingdom of God, and on one occasion, while he was
[2591.90 → 2598.60] eating with them, he gave them this command. Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my father
[2598.60 → 2605.16] promised, which you have heard me speak about. For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will
[2605.16 → 2613.80] be baptized with the Holy Spirit. Then they gathered around him and asked him, Lord, are you at this time
[2613.80 → 2620.94] going to restore the kingdom to Israel? He said to them, it is not for you to know the times or the dates
[2620.94 → 2627.24] the father has set by his own authority, but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you, and you
[2627.24 → 2633.12] will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth.
[2634.50 → 2641.32] After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight.
[2642.70 → 2648.62] They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white
[2648.62 → 2656.90] stood beside them. Men of Galilee, they said, why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same
[2656.90 → 2664.28] Jesus who has been taken from you into heaven will come back in the same way that you have seen him go
[2664.28 → 2667.60] into heaven. This is the word of the Lord.
[2672.74 → 2680.52] This morning we're going to look at what happens in the ascension. We're going to look at how
[2680.52 → 2688.96] that changes or how that fuels our worship of Jesus and how that fuels our mission with him.
[2689.06 → 2693.46] And we're going to jump around to a couple stories, and so I of course encourage you to keep your Bibles
[2693.46 → 2699.16] handy. We will see some of those texts on the screen if you've put that away, but Bible in hand,
[2699.36 → 2702.72] I think, is always going to be better for our shared learning together.
[2702.72 → 2712.36] As we begin, I want to just emphasize and really kind of empathize that I understand that talking
[2712.36 → 2719.24] about Ascension Day and the sort of closeness that we can have with Jesus as a result of the
[2719.24 → 2726.22] ascension, as the result of him leaving this earth, can seem counterintuitive. And honestly,
[2726.22 → 2734.58] I get that. That makes sense to me. If I go away for a week, I haven't done that in a long time,
[2734.64 → 2740.40] but if I previously went to travel for something for church business or for work or to a conference
[2740.40 → 2749.82] or something, when I went away for a week, right, there's a longing in there to come home and to get
[2749.82 → 2755.24] back to my wife and to my kids. And we all heard the phrase, right, absence makes the heart grow
[2755.24 → 2765.84] fonder. But being apart in and of itself doesn't draw them closer to me, right? What draws us closer
[2765.84 → 2773.10] isn't the being apart, really, it's the coming home. But even then, after I've been away for a week in the
[2773.10 → 2779.60] coming home, there's still life stuff that happened, right? Things that Rachel had to do and experience
[2779.60 → 2784.90] and go through on her own while I was away and things that I went through and had to learn and did
[2784.90 → 2791.64] on my own while I was away. And we have to talk about that. We have to come together in the sharing
[2791.64 → 2799.28] of that. We need to bring those experiences together so that we can feel close again, right? Furthermore, we know that
[2799.28 → 2809.44] ordinarily speaking, nearness brings closeness, right? Being in proximity is required to feel close
[2809.44 → 2814.92] to someone. That's why, for instance, long distance relationships are so hard, right? Because
[2814.92 → 2822.42] nearness brings closeness. And so that really begs the question for us this morning. How then does the
[2822.42 → 2832.52] ascension of Jesus, in fact, bring him closer to us? I'm going to make this point. Let's look at another
[2832.52 → 2843.12] Bible story. If your Bible is open to Acts, flip over a page or two to John 20. John 20, I want to
[2843.12 → 2849.70] share with you quickly the story of Jesus appearing to Mary Magdalene. And so the group of women had come
[2849.70 → 2855.38] to the tomb. They found it empty, and they ran back to the disciples. They came, they saw it empty. Furthermore, they saw
[2855.38 → 2861.36] that the cloth had been neatly folded. The disciples came and saw all of this, confirmed that message that
[2861.36 → 2869.42] was told to them. And then they left, really confused. Mary, we're told, stayed alone at the tomb.
[2870.24 → 2878.88] This is that story. Now, Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept, she bent over to look into the
[2878.88 → 2884.76] tomb and saw two angels in white seated where Jesus' body had been, one at the head and the other at the
[2884.76 → 2893.04] foot. They asked her, woman, why are you crying? They've taken my Lord away, she said, and I don't
[2893.04 → 2900.64] know where they have put him. And at this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not
[2900.64 → 2909.66] realize that it was Jesus. He asked her, woman, why are you crying? Who is it that you are looking for?
[2909.66 → 2915.54] Thinking it was the gardener, she said, sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put
[2915.54 → 2924.12] him and I will get him. And Jesus said to her, Mary. And she turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic,
[2924.18 → 2932.00] Rabbi, which means teacher. And Jesus said, do not hold on to me for I have not yet ascended to the
[2932.00 → 2941.64] father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them I am ascending to my father, to your father, to my God
[2941.64 → 2948.26] and your God. Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news. I have seen the Lord.
[2949.60 → 2961.08] Told them that he had said these things to her. Now notice what Jesus says, do not hold on to me for I
[2961.08 → 2970.64] have not yet returned to my father. Now, when we first read this story, we might think that Jesus
[2970.64 → 2978.72] is saying to her, don't touch me, right? Like he can't be touched, that he's too pure or too holy or
[2978.72 → 2984.52] something. Except, of course, that in just a few verses, Jesus is going to tell Thomas, put your
[2984.52 → 2993.44] hands in my side, touch the holes in my hands, right? Jesus says to Thomas, touch me. Instead,
[2993.92 → 2998.78] in Mary's story, and this is one of the places where we're knowing the Greek text that this was
[2998.78 → 3003.92] originally written in, where that really helps, the word that John uses that our Bibles translate,
[3004.12 → 3009.64] do not touch me, do not hold on to me, is a word that means to squeeze tight.
[3009.64 → 3017.18] And so, you can picture it, right? Mary turns, and when she hears Jesus, who she thought was a gardener,
[3017.54 → 3023.62] speak her name, she recognizes who it is, and she wraps her arms around him and squeezes him tight.
[3023.94 → 3034.80] She holds on to him with all of her might. Sometimes when I come home from work, after a day's long work,
[3034.80 → 3041.84] my kids run up to me, and they give me a little hug, and then they run off and say, welcome home.
[3043.38 → 3049.40] But, if I'm putting one of my kids to bed, and I have a meeting that I need to get to,
[3050.32 → 3055.64] right, they squeeze me extra tight, and they say, don't go, daddy, don't go, read me another story.
[3056.74 → 3062.48] So, my daughter will squeeze me and hold on to me and keep me as close as possible so that I can't
[3062.48 → 3070.64] leave. That's what Mary is doing at this moment, right? She thinks that she has lost Jesus and
[3070.64 → 3075.74] finds him again, and that if she just holds on to him tight enough, she won't lose him again.
[3076.36 → 3084.20] She wants him close, close enough to hold on tightly. And that's when Jesus says, don't squeeze
[3084.20 → 3091.74] me, don't hold on to me. I am returning to my Father. And what he is promising here in these words
[3091.74 → 3101.68] is the nearness of the ascension. Jesus is saying, effectively, if I go to be with my Father, I will be
[3101.68 → 3108.32] closer than I am right now, at this moment, with your arms wrapped around me, squeezing tightly.
[3108.32 → 3116.50] Because if he goes, he won't be in her arms. Instead, and this is the best part, I think, of the
[3116.50 → 3122.08] ascension and the promise of the ascension, instead of being squeezed tightly in her arms, Jesus promises
[3122.08 → 3132.84] that he will be in her heart. Think about it. When Jesus is physically present, even in his resurrected
[3132.84 → 3139.58] body, which can appear in locked rooms, can disappear from sight, someone can look directly at him and not
[3139.58 → 3146.18] recognize who it is. There's something different about his resurrected body. But even in that body,
[3146.28 → 3155.84] he is only ever where he is. But if he ascends, and he sends the promised spirit in the presence,
[3155.84 → 3166.18] in the form of the Holy Spirit, then Jesus is present wherever you are, because you carry his
[3166.18 → 3174.42] presence with you when you have the Holy Spirit. Augustine, who was a fourth and fifth century church
[3174.42 → 3182.26] theologian and leader in the church back then, he says this, he said, you ascended from before our eyes,
[3182.26 → 3188.04] and we turn back grieving only to find you in our hearts.
[3189.98 → 3199.30] This is the promise of the ascension. This is what Jesus said would happen. In fact, keep flipping back in your
[3199.30 → 3206.92] Bible to John 16. John 16, Jesus says,
[3206.92 → 3213.70] Now I am going to him who sent me. None of you asks me, where are you going? Rather, you are filled with grief
[3213.70 → 3219.92] because I've said these things. But very truly I tell you, it is for your good that I'm going away.
[3220.28 → 3225.92] Unless I go away, the advocate, and that's another word that we use for the Holy Spirit, the advocate
[3225.92 → 3234.16] will not come to you, but if I go, I will send him to you. And when he, the spirit of truth, the advocate,
[3234.16 → 3241.74] comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own. He will speak only what he hears,
[3241.90 → 3248.96] and he will tell you what is yet to come. He will glorify me because it is from me that he will receive
[3248.96 → 3256.72] what he will make known to you. All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the spirit
[3256.72 → 3269.02] will receive from me what he will make known. Nearness brings closeness, and there's nothing
[3269.02 → 3280.06] nearer to you than in you, in your heart. One writer that I read paraphrases Jesus' words to Mary.
[3280.06 → 3287.26] It says, you can let go of my hand, for I can give you something better than my hand.
[3287.86 → 3294.76] I can put my heart in your heart. The ascension of Jesus makes this possible.
[3295.70 → 3303.48] He can be near to you precisely because his physical body has left this earthly plane.
[3303.48 → 3310.94] Because of the ascension, some of the most comforting words in all scripture are true,
[3311.32 → 3318.32] right, that I will never leave you nor forsake you. Or in the Great Commission, which Nikki shared with us
[3318.32 → 3325.32] earlier, right, some of the last words of Jesus, he says, and surely I am with you always to the very
[3325.32 → 3333.14] end of the age. Jesus ascending up to the Father, Jesus going up to the Father makes possible for you to
[3333.14 → 3341.54] receive him into your heart. His leaving is, in fact, for our receiving.
[3343.54 → 3351.26] And from the right hand of the Father, he is still doing the work that he did before, right? He's still
[3351.26 → 3358.94] doing the work of reconciling the world to God and restoring it and us to his intended design.
[3358.94 → 3367.94] But now, oh, but now you don't have to be in a particular place to hear from him or to see him
[3367.94 → 3374.74] at work because now, by the Holy Spirit, that work is happening wherever you are, anywhere you are. You
[3374.74 → 3380.40] don't have to go to a mountain or to the side of the mountain on the Sea of Galilee to hear him preach
[3380.40 → 3386.62] because Jesus is preached wherever faithful ministers proclaim him and faithful Christians share his love.
[3386.62 → 3394.24] Now you don't have to squeeze tightly to hold on to him instead. Instead, you just invite him near.
[3395.88 → 3403.12] The ascension isn't a loss of intimacy. The ascension is an infinite magnification of the
[3403.12 → 3412.32] available intimacy that we can have with Jesus. And so what does this mean for our worship
[3412.32 → 3419.42] and for our mission? Now, admittedly, and of course, this changes everything, and there are so many things
[3419.42 → 3424.82] that we could talk about here, but I want to just point to three for us this morning.
[3426.58 → 3435.50] First, the nearness of Jesus available to us because of the ascension changes our worship
[3435.50 → 3444.72] together because it places the proper object of our worship in our own hearts. Now, I get that can be
[3444.72 → 3455.46] confusing, so let me explain what I mean. Worship is an act of ascribing worth to something, right? In old
[3455.46 → 3463.66] English, worship used to be worth-ship. You would acknowledge the supreme worth of something. It's the
[3463.66 → 3470.16] act of holding something or someone up and saying, this is amazing. This is worthy of praise. This is
[3470.16 → 3478.26] worthy of notice. This is the worth of this thing gives me purpose and meaning and direction and joy.
[3478.26 → 3486.68] In this thing or person, I will place my hope and my treasure and my heart. Because you see, our hearts
[3486.68 → 3495.50] are made to worship. Our hearts will always worship something or someone. It may not always be the
[3495.50 → 3501.48] right thing. In fact, it's not always the right thing, but our hearts are always worshipping.
[3502.60 → 3509.76] John Calvin, a theologian from the 15th and 16th century that is closely connected to our church
[3509.76 → 3518.04] tradition. He describes the heart as an idol factory, right? Constantly producing idol after idol
[3518.04 → 3527.68] because we can't help but love something or someone. And so, some of us might say that we worship
[3527.68 → 3537.70] Jesus, but our lives tell a different story, right? In fact, some of us worship work or wealth or status.
[3537.70 → 3544.72] We worship success or family or having the right spouse or the right house or the right career.
[3545.56 → 3550.84] And all of these things, most of these things, in any ways, are good in some way. They're in and of
[3550.84 → 3558.62] themselves, they are creations of God that God has said this is good, but they're secondary to the right
[3558.62 → 3566.48] object of our worship. But our worshipping hearts are broken and disordered, and we never put the right
[3566.48 → 3574.02] object of our worship on the throne of our hearts. But the good news of the ascension
[3574.02 → 3582.32] is that we don't have to because God does, right? Jesus going up and sending down his spirit, Jesus
[3582.32 → 3589.68] invading our wayward hearts and setting us on the right direction, the Holy Spirit in the old language
[3589.68 → 3595.82] quickening our dead hearts and making us alive, regenerating us, the Holy Spirit taking our heart
[3595.82 → 3603.56] of stone and changing it into a heart of flesh means that the right object of our worship, Jesus,
[3603.98 → 3612.20] by a miracle of God's grace, seats himself on the throne of our hearts. The ascension makes true worship
[3612.20 → 3618.94] possible, right worship possible, because without his intervening grace, we would never worship him
[3618.94 → 3628.12] properly, we would never worship him well, but because of the ascension, we can. Because Jesus is near us by
[3628.12 → 3639.06] being in us, he elevates himself to the throne of your heart as the object of your worship. And so what you
[3639.06 → 3649.06] can't do, he has done for you, it's the ascension of Jesus that makes this possible for your heart to be his
[3649.06 → 3659.38] throne. And so now, true worship is possible, and we just give ourselves over to it.
[3661.14 → 3664.32] In Ephesians 2 verse 6, Paul writes,
[3664.32 → 3679.00] Now, have you ever experienced worship that feels like it's just lifted you up to heaven?
[3680.60 → 3685.84] I know for some of us in this past year, especially these past months of sitting in our living rooms,
[3686.26 → 3691.80] you know, the same place that we watch football or hockey or whatever, Wheel of Fortune,
[3691.80 → 3697.84] as the same place that we also do church, and so it's been hard to feel that sort of worship that
[3697.84 → 3706.34] lifts us up. It feels like we're seated in heaven, and I get that. But I also get that you have a memory
[3706.34 → 3714.12] of that, or you have a longing for that, and that's what we're talking about here. Jesus goes up so that
[3714.12 → 3721.20] the Spirit come down, and then in worship, the Holy Spirit lifts our hearts so that we can be nearer to
[3721.20 → 3729.30] Jesus. As we hear from him in his word, as we taste and touch him in the supper, as we see him in the
[3729.30 → 3736.70] waters of baptism, as we speak with him in our singing and in our praying, because of the ascension
[3736.70 → 3744.58] of Jesus, our worship is altogether different. Even as he is at the right hand of the Father, he is in you
[3744.58 → 3752.40] by the Holy Spirit who makes your heart a throne for God and directs our worship rightly to Jesus.
[3754.00 → 3759.54] And worship that is directed to Jesus, worship that is fuelled by the Holy Spirit, has a particular
[3759.54 → 3767.24] momentum to it. This is the second effect that the ascension has on our worship, and I'm calling it,
[3767.24 → 3774.92] and I've called this message, Ascension Momentum. In the Gospel of Matthew, before the ascension, before
[3774.92 → 3780.52] the Great Commission, the disciples go to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go, and when
[3780.52 → 3788.38] they saw him, they worshipped him. Drawing near to Jesus, and Jesus drawing near to you leads you to
[3788.38 → 3794.96] worship. The ascension makes, right, worship possible. But then what does Jesus say to his disciples in
[3794.96 → 3799.34] that moment in Matthew, right, that all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me?
[3799.70 → 3805.72] Therefore, go, go out into the world and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of
[3805.72 → 3812.18] the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded
[3812.18 → 3819.04] you, right? In Acts, we read the same thing, but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you, and you
[3819.04 → 3824.60] will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in Judea, and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.
[3824.96 → 3835.18] For the ascension takes Jesus up so that he can come into our hearts, and for us, the ascension then
[3835.18 → 3844.70] takes us out. Ascension Momentum is out. It's always out, out into the world, out into the world as
[3844.70 → 3850.26] disciples making disciples, out into our neighbourhoods, and our cities, and our homes, and our workplaces,
[3850.26 → 3855.68] our third places, wherever we find ourselves, baptizing in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
[3856.20 → 3863.04] and of the Holy Spirit. And so we worship in here, or we worship together as a community,
[3863.04 → 3876.28] so that we can be used of God out there. Worship here together leads to work in mission out there.
[3876.28 → 3884.24] Someone has put it, we gather for worship so that we can scatter in mission. A philosophy professor I had
[3884.24 → 3891.90] in university says, we journey in for the journey out, right? Our worship of Jesus clarifies and convicts
[3891.90 → 3901.90] us for mission with Jesus. Jesus has gone up, but he is in you by the Holy Spirit, and so go, he goes out
[3901.90 → 3910.98] with you. You go out with him, and for him. Right worship always requires a mission application.
[3912.26 → 3915.92] Otherwise, we're just patting ourselves on the back and talking about how good we are.
[3917.44 → 3921.40] Our calling is to talk about how good Jesus is.
[3921.40 → 3931.86] And this, too, as much as it is our work, is God's work. As much as we go out, God goes first. Right?
[3931.90 → 3937.96] The work of converting and saving the lost is God's work by the Holy Spirit through you and through me.
[3939.04 → 3944.68] Now, you may not have the gift of evangelism, as Paul talks about gifts of the Holy Spirit,
[3944.68 → 3948.82] but if Jesus is truly your treasure, you will evangelize.
[3950.84 → 3956.46] Remember a few years ago, friends of mine bought a new house. It was the first house that they bought,
[3956.60 → 3960.38] and when the deal went through, when the offer was accepted, do you know what they did?
[3961.24 → 3966.18] They came over to our house, and they showed it off. They brought the listing and all the pictures
[3966.18 → 3971.14] that they had taken, and they talked about the designs and the plans that they had to transform
[3971.14 → 3976.88] this house and to make it into their home. They shared their joy with us, and they beamed with wonder,
[3977.04 → 3979.76] and they could barely contain it. They were so excited.
[3981.10 → 3983.12] That's how it should be with Jesus in our worship.
[3984.74 → 3987.56] I have another friend who collects watches.
[3988.82 → 3991.36] He loves them. Absolutely loves them.
[3991.56 → 3997.32] He learns all about them. He learns about their history, about the manufacturing process that goes into making them,
[3997.32 → 4000.58] about the specific uniqueness of each watch in his collection,
[4000.58 → 4003.98] and then he evangelizes all of us about them, right?
[4004.00 → 4006.32] He tries to make us watch enthusiasts.
[4006.70 → 4009.42] He tries to convert us to his hobby.
[4009.54 → 4010.44] He once even said to me,
[4010.52 → 4013.68] I will give you this watch if you start a hobby collection with it.
[4015.40 → 4016.68] Or sports fans.
[4017.62 → 4020.26] And man, sports fans are great examples of this, right?
[4020.30 → 4023.74] Because the same person who will tell me that they can't read a book,
[4023.74 → 4027.38] or they can't take a pastor's class on apologetics because they don't learn so good,
[4027.38 → 4033.58] will then turn around and rattle off an entire spring training lineup for the Blue Jays this year,
[4033.64 → 4039.62] and they'll do a statistical comparison to the 92 lineup in the World Series champion team,
[4039.84 → 4043.80] and then they'll make an argument for why this team, this year's team,
[4043.80 → 4046.44] is even better and has a real chance at winning the whole show.
[4046.44 → 4049.38] You see the point, right?
[4049.44 → 4051.74] That you talk about what you love.
[4052.72 → 4057.74] You invest time and energy and passion into what you love.
[4060.22 → 4063.10] What we're seeing here in the ascension
[4063.10 → 4069.44] is that Jesus is a treasure far greater than anything else in all the universe.
[4069.44 → 4070.84] And so share that.
[4071.16 → 4071.68] Tell that.
[4072.06 → 4073.54] Celebrate your knowing him.
[4073.90 → 4077.28] Celebrate your having him by going with him to others.
[4078.74 → 4082.50] And I know that sometimes we are afraid,
[4082.98 → 4084.22] and sometimes we worry.
[4084.60 → 4086.20] What if I don't say the right words?
[4086.30 → 4087.96] Or what if I don't say the right thing?
[4088.26 → 4090.76] But you are not alone.
[4091.22 → 4093.24] Jesus is with you and in you,
[4093.36 → 4095.26] empowering you with the Holy Spirit.
[4095.26 → 4098.02] And even more, when you love something,
[4098.28 → 4100.68] even if you don't know everything about it,
[4100.80 → 4102.34] you still talk about it.
[4102.62 → 4105.18] You just can't help but talk about it.
[4106.62 → 4108.26] We've got to,
[4109.28 → 4110.38] and make no mistake,
[4110.48 → 4113.20] I'm preaching to myself right now just as much as to anyone else,
[4114.00 → 4119.80] we've got to stop letting our fear overwhelm our love for Jesus.
[4120.92 → 4123.76] We've got to stop sitting comfortably in the boat
[4123.76 → 4125.32] when Jesus is out on the waters.
[4126.52 → 4128.70] We've got to start believing that when he says,
[4128.94 → 4131.48] I will never leave you nor forsake you,
[4131.66 → 4134.80] that when he says that he is with us to the end of the age,
[4134.92 → 4136.48] that he actually is.
[4138.66 → 4141.50] And that he's really able to do immeasurably more
[4141.50 → 4143.80] than all we can ask or imagine.
[4143.80 → 4147.04] And imagine for just a minute
[4147.04 → 4150.10] what the church would be like,
[4150.60 → 4155.74] what our community of disciples would be like
[4155.74 → 4158.66] if we could believe that
[4158.66 → 4160.96] even 50% of the time.
[4162.42 → 4165.36] Imagine how that would change your life
[4165.36 → 4167.38] and our lives together.
[4167.38 → 4170.34] Finally,
[4171.34 → 4174.84] the ascension fuels our worship and mission
[4174.84 → 4176.98] because in it and by it,
[4177.18 → 4179.08] we have hope.
[4180.08 → 4182.00] Hope that our worship
[4182.00 → 4184.10] won't always be incomplete
[4184.10 → 4186.36] and half-hearted and half-measures.
[4186.76 → 4188.34] Hope that the mission of God
[4188.34 → 4190.80] does in fact have an end.
[4190.80 → 4191.44] And
[4191.44 → 4195.88] verse 11 of
[4195.88 → 4198.08] our text,
[4198.76 → 4199.92] men of Galilee,
[4200.02 → 4200.30] they said,
[4200.42 → 4202.12] why do you stand here looking into the sky?
[4202.54 → 4204.82] The same Jesus who has been taken from you
[4204.82 → 4205.52] into heaven
[4205.52 → 4207.18] will come back
[4207.18 → 4208.48] in the same way
[4208.48 → 4211.16] you have seen him go.
[4213.68 → 4216.64] Remember at the very beginning of this message,
[4216.92 → 4217.34] I said,
[4217.72 → 4219.12] what draws us closer
[4219.12 → 4221.12] isn't being apart,
[4221.78 → 4222.72] it's the coming home.
[4224.38 → 4226.12] The ascension means
[4226.12 → 4227.60] that Jesus is now
[4227.60 → 4229.12] in heaven glorified
[4229.66 → 4231.60] and that the spirit of God
[4231.60 → 4232.84] is at work in you,
[4233.02 → 4233.86] transforming you
[4233.86 → 4235.34] from one degree of glory
[4235.34 → 4236.28] into another.
[4236.48 → 4237.62] But one day,
[4238.00 → 4239.92] that glory will be here,
[4240.14 → 4241.00] right here,
[4241.08 → 4241.98] on this earth,
[4242.30 → 4242.86] made new.
[4243.06 → 4245.00] And that is a vision of hope
[4245.00 → 4245.98] that overcomes
[4245.98 → 4246.96] whatever trials
[4246.96 → 4247.72] or fears
[4247.72 → 4248.60] or hardships
[4248.60 → 4249.78] we might have
[4249.78 → 4250.38] right now.
[4253.56 → 4254.48] Then I saw
[4254.48 → 4255.08] a new heaven
[4255.08 → 4256.88] and a new earth.
[4257.54 → 4258.82] For the first heaven
[4258.82 → 4260.10] and the first earth
[4260.10 → 4261.14] had passed away
[4261.14 → 4262.62] and there was no longer
[4262.62 → 4263.40] any sea.
[4264.36 → 4265.80] I saw the holy city,
[4265.92 → 4266.70] the new Jerusalem,
[4266.92 → 4267.66] coming down
[4267.66 → 4268.96] out of heaven from God,
[4269.06 → 4270.28] prepared as a bride,
[4270.46 → 4271.48] beautifully dressed
[4271.48 → 4272.54] for her husband.
[4272.54 → 4275.14] And I heard a loud voice
[4275.14 → 4276.42] from the throne saying,
[4276.58 → 4276.76] look,
[4277.16 → 4278.26] God's dwelling place
[4278.26 → 4279.58] is now among the people
[4279.58 → 4280.90] and he will be with them.
[4281.26 → 4282.46] They will be his people
[4282.46 → 4283.36] and God himself
[4283.36 → 4284.24] will be with them
[4284.24 → 4285.20] and be their God.
[4285.30 → 4286.50] He will wipe away
[4286.50 → 4287.78] every tear
[4287.78 → 4288.78] from their eyes.
[4288.88 → 4290.06] There will be no more death
[4290.06 → 4291.04] or mourning
[4291.04 → 4291.74] or crying
[4291.74 → 4292.28] or pain
[4292.28 → 4293.70] for the old order
[4293.70 → 4294.26] of things
[4294.26 → 4295.64] has passed away.
[4296.40 → 4297.76] He who is seated
[4297.76 → 4298.68] on the throne
[4298.68 → 4299.14] said,
[4299.14 → 4300.58] I am making
[4300.58 → 4302.74] everything new.
[4304.06 → 4304.64] Then he said,
[4304.74 → 4305.76] write this down
[4305.76 → 4307.08] for these words
[4307.08 → 4308.06] are trustworthy
[4308.06 → 4310.06] and true.
[4311.70 → 4313.48] The gospel of Jesus' ascension
[4313.48 → 4314.14] is that he lives
[4314.14 → 4315.00] in your heart.
[4315.34 → 4316.96] He fuels our worship.
[4317.16 → 4318.04] He sends us out
[4318.04 → 4318.74] in mission
[4318.74 → 4319.44] and the gospel
[4319.44 → 4320.62] of Jesus' ascension
[4320.62 → 4323.00] is that he will come back
[4323.00 → 4323.96] in the same way
[4323.96 → 4325.00] that we saw him go
[4325.00 → 4328.28] and make all things new.
[4329.14 → 4330.86] And until that day,
[4331.58 → 4333.04] I press forward
[4333.04 → 4334.10] in worship.
[4335.10 → 4335.76] Until that day,
[4335.84 → 4336.64] I press forward
[4336.64 → 4337.56] in mission
[4337.56 → 4338.62] with Jesus
[4338.62 → 4340.30] and for Jesus
[4340.30 → 4341.82] because he is king
[4341.82 → 4343.34] over all the universe.
[4343.68 → 4344.54] He has promised
[4344.54 → 4345.68] to never leave me
[4345.68 → 4346.94] nor forsake me
[4346.94 → 4348.84] and I believe him.
[4350.62 → 4351.70] Believe him.
[4353.10 → 4354.18] Love him.
[4354.18 → 4356.64] and do not
[4356.64 → 4359.44] be afraid.
[4360.54 → 4361.12] Amen.
[4364.62 → 4365.46] Lord Jesus,
[4366.34 → 4368.54] in your presence
[4368.54 → 4370.18] we stand
[4370.18 → 4371.60] because your presence
[4371.60 → 4372.78] is here
[4372.78 → 4374.06] by your spirit.
[4374.18 → 4374.64] Your presence
[4374.64 → 4376.24] is in each
[4376.24 → 4377.36] of our hearts
[4377.36 → 4378.08] by grace
[4378.08 → 4379.06] through faith
[4379.06 → 4380.32] in your Holy Spirit.
[4380.68 → 4382.18] You are here.
[4382.18 → 4382.84] here.
[4384.22 → 4385.48] Wherever we are.
[4387.98 → 4388.80] For God,
[4388.88 → 4389.46] your bride
[4389.46 → 4390.50] is not contained
[4390.50 → 4391.52] by a building
[4391.52 → 4393.90] but your bride
[4393.90 → 4394.64] is defined
[4394.64 → 4396.08] by a mission.
[4398.68 → 4399.00] And so,
[4399.14 → 4399.50] Lord God,
[4399.62 → 4399.92] we,
[4400.30 → 4401.52] your church,
[4401.76 → 4403.02] longing for that day
[4403.02 → 4404.28] when you will make
[4404.28 → 4405.28] all things new,
[4405.70 → 4405.90] we,
[4406.10 → 4406.64] your church,
[4406.70 → 4408.24] go from this place
[4408.24 → 4409.18] with the momentum
[4409.18 → 4410.84] of the ascension
[4410.84 → 4411.80] to proclaim
[4411.80 → 4412.96] your kingdom come
[4412.96 → 4414.26] and your kingdom coming,
[4414.48 → 4415.70] we go forth together
[4415.70 → 4417.30] as a body of believers
[4417.30 → 4418.48] that you
[4418.48 → 4420.14] might be made
[4420.14 → 4420.94] real
[4420.94 → 4422.18] in the lives
[4422.18 → 4423.22] of all those
[4423.22 → 4424.16] whom we
[4424.16 → 4424.98] meet.
[4427.22 → 4428.10] And so,
[4428.18 → 4429.02] take our fears
[4429.02 → 4429.90] and replace it
[4429.90 → 4431.04] with your perfect love.
[4432.58 → 4433.86] Take our worry

[4500.70 → 4506.26] to the ones the world has cast aside.
[4506.26 → 4512.02] Where you want me, I will be.
[4512.56 → 4519.56] I will go, I will go, I will go, Lord, send me to the world,
[4519.56 → 4524.00] to the lost, to the poor and concrete.

[4540.74 → 4546.82] Let me not be blind with privilege.
[4546.82 → 4551.82] Give me eyes to see the pain.
[4552.98 → 4557.82] Let the blessing you poured out on me.
[4558.72 → 4562.82] Not be spent on me in vain.
[4564.58 → 4568.82] Let my life be used or changed.
[4568.82 → 4576.82] I will go, I will go, I will go, Lord, send me to the world,
[4577.86 → 4581.82] to the lost, to the poor and concrete.
[4581.82 → 4586.82] Take everything I am, I play within your hands.
[4586.82 → 4591.82] I will go, I will go, send me.
[4593.98 → 4597.08] I want to live for you.

[4688.24 → 4691.18] And so receive God's blessing.
[4693.12 → 4695.62] May God go before you to lead you.
[4695.62 → 4698.32] May God go behind you to guard you.
[4698.44 → 4700.70] May God go beneath you to support you.
[4700.90 → 4703.90] And may God go beside you to befriend you.
[4704.78 → 4707.14] Do not be afraid.
[4707.90 → 4710.10] Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[4710.52 → 4712.48] Do not be afraid.
[4713.76 → 4718.66] But go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
