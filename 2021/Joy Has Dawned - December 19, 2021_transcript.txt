[0.00 --> 9.12]  So this was truly God, wrapped up in a tattered blanket.
[12.66 --> 19.62]  Love was finally here, sleeping while the world awakened.
[19.62 --> 28.62]  And redemption began with a baby.
[30.00 --> 42.62]  In Bethlehem, all of the angels lifted up their voices and filled the night with hallelujah.
[42.62 --> 46.62]  God is with us now.
[47.52 --> 52.62]  Everyone come and join the heavenly chorus.
[53.76 --> 58.68]  Our Savior, King, is here before us.
[58.68 --> 63.30]  All to hear the sound.
[63.30 --> 71.30]  The song creation sang when hope came down.
[73.14 --> 77.80]  Let us sing redemption song.
[78.70 --> 84.10]  Let us worship Christ the Holy One.
[84.10 --> 92.72]  We were lost but we were found when hope came down.
[92.72 --> 96.72]  When hope came down.
[96.72 --> 110.34]  All of the angels lifted up their voices and filled the night with hallelujahs.
[110.34 --> 114.96]  God is with us now.
[114.96 --> 120.58]  Everyone come and join the heavenly chorus.
[120.58 --> 128.34]  Our Savior, King, is here before us.
[128.34 --> 129.20]  And we are with us now.
[129.20 --> 132.20]  Let us worship Christ the Holy One.
[132.20 --> 135.26]  Let us worship Christ the Holy One.
[135.26 --> 139.20]  Let us worship Christ the Holy One.
[139.20 --> 143.24]  When hope came down
[143.24 --> 153.98]  When hope came, when hope came down
[169.20 --> 188.20]  O come, all ye faithful
[188.20 --> 194.20]  Joyful and triumphant
[194.20 --> 207.20]  O come, ye O come ye to Bethlehem
[207.20 --> 214.20]  Come and behold him
[214.20 --> 220.20]  Born the King of angels
[220.20 --> 226.20]  O come, let us adore him
[226.20 --> 232.20]  O come, let us adore him
[232.20 --> 239.20]  O come, let us adore him
[239.20 --> 246.20]  Christ the Lord
[246.20 --> 253.20]  O call of glory
[253.20 --> 262.20]  O skipping this letter
[262.20 --> 267.24]  Sing in exultation.
[267.24 --> 279.40]  Sing all ye citizens of heaven above.
[281.00 --> 286.86]  Glory to God, oh.
[286.86 --> 292.74]  Glory in the highest.
[292.74 --> 299.06]  Oh, come let us adore Him.
[299.28 --> 305.50]  Oh, come let us adore Him.
[305.66 --> 315.24]  Oh, come let us adore Him, Christ.
[315.24 --> 325.12]  Lord, we worship Christ, Lord.
[327.12 --> 329.62]  We worship You, Jesus.
[329.62 --> 337.12]  Oh, come let us adore Him.
[337.12 --> 345.00]  Oh, come let us adore Him.
[345.00 --> 349.00]  Oh, come let us adore Him.
[349.00 --> 354.88]  Happy morning, Jesus.
[354.88 --> 364.88]  To Thee be all glory given.
[364.88 --> 371.76]  Word of the Father.
[372.76 --> 377.76]  All in flesh appearing.
[377.76 --> 385.64]  Oh, come let us adore Him.
[385.64 --> 387.64]  Oh, come let us adore Him.
[387.64 --> 388.64]  Welcome, everyone.
[388.64 --> 389.64]  It's good to have you all here.
[389.64 --> 393.64]  Welcome to everyone online as well.
[393.64 --> 397.52]  And a special welcome to all those visiting.
[397.52 --> 401.52]  Yeah, we're really excited to have you here with us this evening.
[401.52 --> 407.52]  Due to the recent COVID mandate and the evolving situation across the province, I ask you please,
[407.52 --> 417.40]  well, I assume you've already sanitized as you walked in and please keep your mask on, especially while you're singing along with us.
[417.40 --> 430.40]  Yeah, on your way in, if you were unable to contribute to the absurd flood relief and are still willing to help out, there's a link in the program to donate online and cash donations are still accepted as well.
[430.40 --> 431.40]  Yeah, thank you.
[431.40 --> 434.40]  Thank you so much for your support.
[434.40 --> 442.40]  So tonight, as a church, we are thrilled to present to you Lloyd's Larson, Joy Has Dawned.
[442.40 --> 452.40]  Joy Has Dawned is a Christmas musical celebrating the birth of Christ and the hope that He brings to the world.
[452.40 --> 459.40]  The central theme of joy is highlighted through the familiar tunes, Joy to the World, Joyful, Joyful,
[459.40 --> 466.40]  We Adore Thee, and through Keith Getty's new music, Joy Has Dawned, hence the title.
[466.40 --> 475.40]  Interspersed with readings, Lloyd Larson takes these tunes, along with many more, to bring the Christmas story to life.
[475.40 --> 482.40]  As the musical comes to a close, the listener is left with an overwhelming sense of hope.
[482.40 --> 491.40]  A hope that only Christ can bring that is essential for overcoming the challenges of today's world.
[491.40 --> 497.40]  Throughout the musical, there are portions where you, as a congregation, are encouraged to sing along.
[497.40 --> 505.40]  Whenever the lyrics are yellow up, whenever the lyrics are yellow, you're welcome to join us.
[505.40 --> 512.40]  The sing along portions in the program are only a select few near the end.
[512.40 --> 519.40]  So I will now take a moment to thank all those involved who made this evening possible.
[519.40 --> 531.40]  First, and most importantly, I thank my wife, Juliana, for supporting me through watching the kids during all the many rehearsals.
[531.40 --> 538.40]  Without you, this evening doesn't happen. So thank you so much, honey.
[538.40 --> 546.40]  Thank you, choir members, for all your time and effort invested into making this musical come together.
[546.40 --> 551.40]  And for putting up with my antics all these weeks.
[551.40 --> 555.40]  This includes our wonderful children's choir in the back there.
[555.40 --> 558.40]  Thank you, kids, so much for doing this.
[558.40 --> 564.40]  And of course, a thank you to their parents, bringing them to and from rehearsal.
[564.40 --> 573.40]  A special thanks to my dad, Neil deGuis, for helping me transport the piano week after week after week
[573.40 --> 578.40]  so I could more easily conduct rehearsals.
[578.40 --> 581.40]  And he also provided everyone with folders.
[581.40 --> 590.40]  A special thanks also to my mom, Katie deGuis, for assisting me with the logistics of this evening leading up to this evening.
[590.40 --> 593.40]  And for providing singing masks for everybody.
[593.40 --> 600.40]  Thank you, Eric, for so generously giving your time and expertise on the piano.
[600.40 --> 602.40]  It's much appreciated.
[602.40 --> 608.40]  Thank you, Peter and Fran, for your time spent learning these narrations.
[608.40 --> 614.40]  Thank you, Ken, for assisting Eric in turning pages.
[614.40 --> 620.40]  And thank you to the deacons who were able to help with this night.
[620.40 --> 622.40]  Now those behind the scenes.
[622.40 --> 626.40]  Thank you, Pastor Chris, for your invested interest in the musical.
[626.40 --> 629.40]  Your approachability made everything easier.
[629.40 --> 632.40]  Anything that needed discussing was quickly resolved.
[632.40 --> 636.40]  Thank you, Langley Christian, for lending the choir risers.
[636.40 --> 641.40]  And to Eric Van Heusen for lending the truck so I could transport them over here.
[641.40 --> 644.40]  Thank you, Johanna, for helping coordinate this evening.
[644.40 --> 649.40]  Thank you, Linda, for putting together the overheads.
[649.40 --> 651.40]  And Matt, for handling the soundboard.
[651.40 --> 656.40]  Thank you, Nicole, for putting together the Facebook Instagram post.
[656.40 --> 663.40]  And last, but most certainly not least, thank you, Marilyn, for setting up the online link
[663.40 --> 665.40]  and putting the programs together.
[665.40 --> 667.40]  I hope I didn't miss anyone.
[667.40 --> 677.40]  Now, for myself and I think Eric North here, this is sort of a special night.
[677.40 --> 688.40]  So I, because there is someone here who, yeah, who had a musical influence on both of us.
[688.40 --> 691.40]  Early in our musical development.
[691.40 --> 694.40]  Way back in high school 20 years ago.
[694.40 --> 696.40]  Yeah, so Mike Angel, I don't know where you are.
[696.40 --> 698.40]  Could you stand up?
[698.40 --> 700.40]  Yeah.
[700.40 --> 701.40]  There he is.
[701.40 --> 702.40]  Give him a round of applause.
[702.40 --> 703.40]  Yeah, there he is.
[703.40 --> 704.40]  Yeah, there he is.
[704.40 --> 717.40]  Yeah, so Mike, yeah, it's Mr. and Mrs. Angel, it's great to have you here with us tonight.
[717.40 --> 723.40]  Now, this was the portion that I wasn't sure how, it was, this was the most difficult part
[723.40 --> 724.40]  to write.
[724.40 --> 727.40]  Yes, I am reading off the script.
[727.40 --> 736.40]  Yeah, so I would, I would, before we proceed to the musical, yeah, we need to acknowledge
[736.40 --> 740.40]  someone who is unable to be here with us tonight.
[740.40 --> 746.40]  Someone who brought an incredible amount of musical impact to the church here at Emmanuel.
[746.40 --> 756.40]  Yeah, for those of you who don't know Dave Alexander, he passed away approximately one year ago from
[756.40 --> 761.40]  ALS at far, far too young an age.
[761.40 --> 769.40]  And, yeah, our heartfelt thoughts continue to go out to Juanita and the kids and all the surrounding family.
[769.40 --> 776.40]  Dave was one of the worship leaders here at Emmanuel and also acted as choir director from time to time.
[776.40 --> 783.40]  I didn't know Dave personally, yet at his celebration of life, I found myself getting emotional.
[783.40 --> 787.40]  As a young boy, I was amazed how this guy could play the piano.
[787.40 --> 791.40]  How many times is he going to change key, I thought to myself.
[791.40 --> 797.40]  Did he write the chords down or did he just do that on the top of his head?
[797.40 --> 800.40]  My guess was the latter.
[800.40 --> 807.40]  I have fond memories playing bassoon in the orchestra for a cantata Dave was directing right here in this very space.
[807.40 --> 813.40]  Before rehearsal, he would ask me to play a few notes on the bassoon because he loved the sound of it.
[813.40 --> 818.40]  He was fond of many instruments though, as many of you know.
[818.40 --> 828.40]  About three years ago, when we first formed the choir here at Emmanuel, Dave joined us right here on the stage in his wheelchair.
[828.40 --> 832.40]  Afterwards, he commented,
[832.40 --> 837.40]  I felt like I was part of the choir.
[837.40 --> 840.40]  And he preached that Sunday.
[840.40 --> 842.40]  Yeah.
[842.40 --> 847.40]  So, yeah, we remember and we move forward.
[847.40 --> 864.40]  At this time, before we dedicate the service to God through prayer, I ask that you all turn off your cell phones, pagers, anything I will make any noise to disrupt the musical.
[864.40 --> 869.40]  After the prayer, we will begin the musical.
[869.40 --> 874.40]  And I ask that you save your applause to the very end.
[874.40 --> 875.40]  Thank you.
[875.40 --> 878.40]  Now, John Folkerts will lead us in the prayer.
[878.40 --> 884.40]  Shall we pray?
[884.40 --> 891.40]  Heavenly Father, we bow our heads before you tonight.
[891.40 --> 899.40]  We come here to adore you, to honor you, Lord, and to give you praise through music.
[899.40 --> 902.40]  Lord, we thank you for these opportunities.
[902.40 --> 905.40]  We thank you that we may come here together.
[905.40 --> 909.40]  We thank you, Lord, for the gift of music.
[909.40 --> 911.40]  We thank you for the gift of voices.
[911.40 --> 917.40]  And we pray, Lord, that we may honor you as we use these gifts tonight.
[917.40 --> 926.40]  And, Lord, for those of us who here are listening also, we pray that you would open our hearts and that we, too, may hear the words that are being spoken and sung.
[926.40 --> 936.40]  And that together, Lord, we may praise you and give you all the glory and honor as we celebrate the joy of Christmas, the birth of your son, Jesus.
[936.40 --> 939.40]  Lord, we thank you for your gift to us.
[939.40 --> 943.40]  And we pray, Lord, that tonight you would accept our gifts to you also.
[943.40 --> 946.40]  We pray this, Lord, in your name.
[946.40 --> 947.40]  Amen.
[966.40 --> 969.40]  We pray, Lord, we thank you for the gift of hugs.
[977.40 --> 978.40]  Amen.
[979.40 --> 983.40]  Amen.
[983.40 --> 984.40]  Amen.
[984.40 --> 986.40]  Amen.
[992.40 --> 993.40]  Amen.
[993.40 --> 1019.56]  Joy to the world, joy to the world, joy to the world,
[1019.56 --> 1029.56]  joy to the world, the Lord has come.
[1029.56 --> 1034.56]  Far by the sheep we watched at night,
[1034.56 --> 1039.56]  black tidings brought an angel bright,
[1039.56 --> 1047.56]  how great our joy, joy, joy, joy.
[1049.56 --> 1059.56]  Praise be the Lord in Babylon high.
[1059.56 --> 1063.56]  Where shall he once so he did say,
[1063.56 --> 1077.56]  in Bethlehem today, how great our joy, joy, joy, joy.
[1077.56 --> 1083.56]  Praise be the Lord in heaven high.
[1083.56 --> 1088.56]  Thank you and praise be the Lord.
[1088.56 --> 1093.56]  Hail and shield.

[1103.00 --> 1104.00]  Chant.
[1133.00 --> 1159.80]  not
[1163.00 --> 1191.26]  Joy to the world, the Lord is come, let earth receive her King, let every heart prepare Him room, and heaven and nature sing, and heaven and nature sing, and heaven and earth, let nature sing.
[1191.26 --> 1221.24]  We'll bring our joy, we'll bring our joy, joy to the earth, the Savior rings, let all their golden songs and blood, their songs and blood,
[1221.26 --> 1240.26]  the fields and ponds, the hills and plains, repeat the sounding joy, repeat the sounding joy.
[1240.26 --> 1256.26]  Joy to the world, the Lord has come.
[1256.26 --> 1268.74]  Joy to the Lord, the Lord has come.
[1269.56 --> 1275.30]  Joy has dawned and today we celebrate God's great gift of love to all.
[1275.30 --> 1287.22]  But to Old Testament Israel, the hope of a brighter tomorrow, the promise of a joyful future, seemed an elusive dream.
[1287.22 --> 1297.46]  For 400 years, God's chosen people languished in bondage, longing for the day when the promised Messiah would come to deliver them.
[1298.20 --> 1307.48]  The prophet Isaiah had assured them that though they were a people walking in darkness, a great light would eventually shine upon them.
[1307.48 --> 1325.92]  A child would be born, a son given, and the government would be upon his shoulders, and he would be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.
[1325.92 --> 1332.40]  Anguish and weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.
[1332.40 --> 1344.66]  Joy, there'll be joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy.
[1344.66 --> 1357.78]  There'll be joy, there'll be joy, there'll be joy, there'll be joy in the morning of the day.
[1357.84 --> 1361.92]  There'll be joy in the morning of the day.
[1361.92 --> 1366.30]  For the bread of the dog, the good Lord, his is gone.
[1366.46 --> 1370.12]  There'll be joy, joy, of the day.
[1370.12 --> 1375.76]  And the glory, glory, glory of the Lord will shine.
[1375.76 --> 1387.12]  And the glory, glory, glory of the Lord will bring the truth divine.
[1387.58 --> 1395.60]  Joyful, joyful, we adore thee, God of glory, Lord of love.
[1395.60 --> 1405.60]  Hearts unfold like flowers before thee, O pray to the Son of God.
[1411.60 --> 1418.60]  There'll be joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy.
[1418.60 --> 1425.60]  There'll be joy in the morning, there'll be joy in the morning of the dead.
[1426.60 --> 1430.82]  And the bright, dark, and the dark is gone.
[1431.02 --> 1433.60]  There'll be joy, joy, joy.
[1433.60 --> 1435.60]  There'll be joy, joy, joy, joy.
[1435.60 --> 1439.60]  There'll be joy, joy, joy.
[1439.60 --> 1442.60]  There'll be joy, joy.

[1485.80 --> 1510.80]  Let the glory, glory, glory of the Lord will bring the truth divine.
[1515.80 --> 1521.80]  Isaiah prophesied that a virgin would conceive and give birth to Emmanuel.
[1521.80 --> 1530.80]  In God's perfect timing, a young maiden named Mary, who was engaged to a man named Joseph, a descendant of King David,
[1530.80 --> 1535.80]  was chosen by God to become the mother of the promised Messiah.
[1535.80 --> 1544.80]  And so it came to be that Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.
[1544.80 --> 1550.80]  Mary and Joseph went up from the town of Nazareth to Bethlehem, the town of David.
[1550.80 --> 1556.80]  And while they were there, the time came for the baby to be born.
[1556.80 --> 1567.80]  Born a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, for there had been no room for them in the inn.
[1567.80 --> 1569.80]  Mary had a baby, my Lord.
[1569.80 --> 1573.80]  Mary had a baby, my Lord.
[1573.80 --> 1577.80]  Mary had a baby, my Lord.
[1577.80 --> 1585.80]  Mary had a baby, my Lord.
[1585.80 --> 1593.80]  Mary had a baby, my Lord.
[1593.80 --> 1615.80]  Mary had a baby, my Lord.
[1615.80 --> 1625.80]  Mary had a baby, my Lord.
[1625.80 --> 1630.60]  did she name him

[1708.52 --> 1710.52]  Oh
[1738.52 --> 1740.52]  Oh
[1768.52 --> 1770.52]  Oh
[1795.56 --> 1797.56]  It was a quiet night
[1798.52 --> 1800.02]  Just an ordinary night
[1800.02 --> 1802.38]  There were shepherds
[1802.38 --> 1804.70]  Keeping watch over their sheep
[1804.70 --> 1806.74]  On a Judean hillside
[1806.74 --> 1808.52]  Outside of Bethlehem
[1808.52 --> 1814.88]  When an angel appeared to the shepherds
[1814.88 --> 1818.02]  And the glory of the Lord shone around them
[1818.02 --> 1819.60]  They were terrified
[1819.60 --> 1822.14]  The angel said to them
[1822.14 --> 1824.26]  Do not be afraid
[1824.26 --> 1827.60]  For I bring you good news of great joy
[1827.60 --> 1828.64]  Today

[1843.44 --> 1846.14]  A great company of the heavenly host
[1846.14 --> 1847.64]  Appeared with the angel
[1847.64 --> 1849.84]  Praising God and saying
[1849.84 --> 1852.46]  Glory to God in the highest
[1852.46 --> 1853.40]  And on earth

[1940.56 --> 1945.48]  Joy of every longing heart

[1948.44 --> 1954.80]  Joy has done
[1954.80 --> 1956.84]  The shepherds are bringing
[1956.84 --> 1960.62]  Gifts of love, adoration, and praise

[1993.54 --> 2003.14]  The shepherds immediately left
[2003.14 --> 2007.04]  And soon found Mary, Joseph, and the newborn baby
[2007.04 --> 2009.24]  Who was lying in the manger
[2009.24 --> 2012.08]  Just as the angel had told them
[2012.08 --> 2015.54]  After offering their humble gifts
[2015.54 --> 2017.68]  Of adoration and praise
[2017.68 --> 2018.62]  They hurried off
[2018.62 --> 2020.24]  They hurried off to spread the word
[2020.24 --> 2021.54]  All they had witnessed
[2021.54 --> 2023.68]  The angelic proclamation
[2023.68 --> 2026.14]  The newborn child in the manger
[2026.14 --> 2028.72]  The wonder of two young parents
[2028.72 --> 2031.10]  Embracing their miraculous roles
[2031.10 --> 2033.62]  In God's unfolding story
[2033.62 --> 2036.82]  All who heard it
[2036.82 --> 2040.24]  Were amazed at what the shepherds said
[2040.24 --> 2042.92]  But Mary treasured up
[2042.92 --> 2044.68]  All of these things
[2044.68 --> 2047.26]  And pondered them in her heart
[2047.26 --> 2053.12]  Jesus, joy of the highest heaven
[2053.12 --> 2056.76]  Born as a little baby
[2056.76 --> 2061.12]  Under a wondrous star
[2061.12 --> 2067.02]  Like us, crying, he takes his first breath
[2067.02 --> 2070.42]  Fell by his mother, helpless
[2070.42 --> 2074.36]  Close to her meeting heart
[2074.36 --> 2079.74]  Jesus, live in a lowly manger
[2079.74 --> 2083.94]  Facing a world of dangers
[2083.94 --> 2087.30]  Won't you turn me a stranger
[2087.30 --> 2090.98]  Into a child of God
[2090.98 --> 2096.84]  Jesus, live in a lowly manger
[2096.84 --> 2101.08]  Facing a world of dangers
[2101.08 --> 2104.32]  Come to turn me a stranger
[2104.32 --> 2108.92]  Into a child of God
[2108.92 --> 2122.98]  O Jesus, King of the highest heaven
[2122.98 --> 2126.68]  Learning to take his first step
[2126.68 --> 2130.28]  That he might play his life
[2130.28 --> 2135.80]  Like us, knowing our smiles and sorrows
[2135.80 --> 2139.12]  He shall know the way to follow
[2139.12 --> 2142.76]  A way that is true and right
[2142.76 --> 2148.16]  Jesus, take away every darkness
[2148.16 --> 2151.52]  Standing my sinful footsteps
[2151.52 --> 2155.44]  That I might in your goodness
[2155.44 --> 2159.04]  Live as a child of God
[2159.04 --> 2164.16]  Jesus, take away every darkness
[2164.16 --> 2167.98]  Say my sinful footsteps
[2167.98 --> 2171.48]  That I might in your goodness
[2171.48 --> 2177.16]  Live as a child of God
[2177.16 --> 2184.34]  A way in a manger
[2184.34 --> 2189.30]  A friend for a friend
[2189.30 --> 2194.00]  The little Lord Jesus
[2194.00 --> 2199.18]  Lay down his sweet hand
[2199.18 --> 2204.30]  The stars in the bright sky
[2204.30 --> 2209.12]  Look down where he lay
[2209.12 --> 2213.98]  The little Lord Jesus
[2213.98 --> 2215.98]  As we
[2215.98 --> 2221.98]  Onward Jesus
[2221.98 --> 2226.98]  Joy of the highest heaven
[2226.98 --> 2230.66]  Born as a little baby
[2230.66 --> 2237.98]  Under a wondrous star
[2237.98 --> 2239.98]  A way in a manger
[2239.98 --> 2252.78]  After Jesus was born in Bethlehem
[2252.78 --> 2254.70]  During the reign of King Herod
[2254.70 --> 2256.80]  There were Magi from the east
[2256.80 --> 2257.96]  Who came to Jerusalem
[2257.96 --> 2258.80]  Asking
[2258.80 --> 2261.30]  Where is the one who has been born
[2261.30 --> 2262.38]  King of the Jews?
[2262.98 --> 2265.26]  We have seen his star in the east
[2265.26 --> 2267.26]  And have come to worship him
[2267.26 --> 2268.76]  King Herod
[2268.76 --> 2271.30]  Disturbed by this inquiry
[2271.30 --> 2273.06]  Called together the chief priests
[2273.06 --> 2274.36]  And teachers of the law
[2274.36 --> 2276.54]  Asking them where the Christ
[2276.54 --> 2277.44]  Was to be born
[2277.44 --> 2279.58]  In Bethlehem of Judea
[2279.58 --> 2280.82]  They replied
[2280.82 --> 2283.26]  Quoting from the prophet Micah
[2283.80 --> 2286.62]  Herod called the Magi secretly
[2286.62 --> 2288.38]  And found out from them
[2288.38 --> 2290.78]  The exact time the star had appeared
[2290.78 --> 2293.08]  He sent them to Bethlehem
[2293.08 --> 2293.60]  And said
[2293.60 --> 2296.40]  Go and make a careful search
[2296.40 --> 2297.22]  For the child
[2297.22 --> 2299.12]  Then report to me
[2299.12 --> 2300.80]  So that I too
[2300.80 --> 2302.54]  May go and worship him
[2302.54 --> 2304.88]  The Magi went on their way
[2304.88 --> 2306.70]  And the star they had seen
[2306.70 --> 2307.40]  In the east
[2307.40 --> 2308.50]  Went before them
[2308.50 --> 2310.34]  Until it stopped over the place
[2310.34 --> 2311.92]  Where the child was
[2311.92 --> 2313.88]  There they found Mary
[2313.88 --> 2316.00]  With his mother Mary
[2316.00 --> 2317.14]  There they found Jesus
[2317.14 --> 2318.36]  With his mother Mary
[2318.36 --> 2320.28]  They bowed down
[2320.28 --> 2321.38]  And worshipped him
[2321.38 --> 2322.96]  Opening their treasures
[2322.96 --> 2323.98]  They presented him
[2323.98 --> 2325.24]  With gifts of gold
[2325.24 --> 2327.18]  Incense and myrrh
[2327.18 --> 2339.24]  And the star of the morning
[2339.24 --> 2341.66]  Dawn on our clock

[2356.10 --> 2362.10]  And where our redeemer is made
[2362.10 --> 2366.26]  God shall we
[2366.26 --> 2367.62]  Good shall we
[2367.62 --> 2369.58]  Give us the devotion
[2369.58 --> 2371.98]  Shall we reach
[2371.98 --> 2375.58]  And we make offerings divine
[2375.58 --> 2378.44]  Gems of the mountain
[2378.44 --> 2381.22]  And pearls of the ocean
