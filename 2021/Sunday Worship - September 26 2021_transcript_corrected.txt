[1469.80 → 1499.78] Thank you.
[1499.78 → 1505.02] Church is to establish a safe and healthy church, a community where abuse
[1505.02 → 1509.92] itself becomes unthinkable and where survivors feel supported and safe. The
[1509.92 → 1514.66] Safe Church Ministry equips congregations in abuse awareness,
[1514.66 → 1519.88] prevention and response. They're from our denomination. They also
[1519.88 → 1526.30] offer workshops that are free to any of the members and I
[1526.30 → 1534.10] encourage you if you see them to join up and participate in that. The Emanuel
[1534.10 → 1539.68] Christian Reformed Church here also has kind of expanded the role of the Safe
[1539.68 → 1544.40] Church Committee, and we just look at safety as a whole not only abuse where
[1544.40 → 1550.58] we equip the team leaders and so forth with teaching and awareness and they all
[1550.58 → 1554.98] have binders with information and so forth, but we've also done some other things.
[1554.98 → 1560.62] We look at church as a whole as a safe environment so we've done things like
[1560.62 → 1566.26] improve security with security cameras. We work with the deacons and the Board of
[1566.26 → 1573.76] Stewards, and we have established now a first aid equipment room especially with
[1573.76 → 1578.02] a bed and everything so that if someone needs that that's available to them and
[1578.02 → 1583.22] along with that is an earthquake preparedness in that same room. That room
[1583.22 → 1588.92] is on the east side south of the bathrooms and in case of an earthquake when there
[1588.92 → 1594.26] is a meeting here or something happens there is enough food and water for 40 for
[1594.26 → 1598.22] three days or 80 for a day and a half so that'll just hopefully get people
[1598.22 → 1604.22] through to be able to get back to their homes or to access other services. So
[1604.22 → 1613.70] we've been doing a lot of other things as well. We have also yeah I won't go into
[1613.70 → 1617.34] all the things but the other thing that I wanted to ask was if anybody's
[1617.34 → 1622.40] interested we have now converted back from the COVID response team because we
[1622.40 → 1628.68] did that for 18 months back into the Safe Church Committee so since restrictions are
[1628.68 → 1633.24] gone now that all the programs are open so if you're interested please contact me.
[1633.24 → 1637.44] We do need a few more members. I want to thank Heather Astra for stepping up.
[1637.44 → 1641.40] She's going to be taking care of all the medical aspects and the disaster relief
[1641.40 → 1648.18] section and also Marguerite Scone has stepped up to help as well. So we do need
[1648.18 → 1653.70] two or three more people so if you could find your heart for that we appreciate that.
[1653.70 → 1658.74] And next week's offering I will go to that will be for the budget and Seeds of Hope
[1658.74 → 1664.02] Children's Ministry. Please give as the Lord has given you.
[1683.70 → 1690.20] good news as the prime minister.
[1690.20 → 1710.60] Hurry up take the Lord from the
[1710.60 → 1713.00] of Jesus
[1713.00 → 1715.12] We cry
[1715.12 → 1716.26] holy

[1763.86 → 1764.92] Holy
[1764.92 → 1766.06] Holy

[1766.60 → 1768.60] And we
[1768.60 → 1769.86] Cried

[1776.24 → 1779.02] The
[1779.02 → 1779.94] True
[1779.94 → 1782.80] But we

[1788.88 → 1808.32] Holy, holy, holy, and we cry, Holy, holy, holy, and we cry, Holy, holy, holy is the Lamb.
[1818.88 → 1822.90] It's time now for the children's blessing.
[1823.16 → 1825.10] Everyone, all the kids up to age, what is it?
[1825.20 → 1825.72] Grade four?
[1825.90 → 1826.52] Come on up.
[1840.56 → 1841.20] You're good?
[1841.40 → 1841.84] All right.
[1842.14 → 1844.20] Well, it's good to see all the kids this morning.
[1844.20 → 1851.98] I already had a question here this morning from one kid who wants to know if we're jumping off the stage again this morning.
[1854.06 → 1855.16] That was fun, wasn't it?
[1855.60 → 1856.28] You know what?
[1856.36 → 1867.04] I got some great video last week, and I was going to put it up on the screen, but does anybody, any of you kids ever heard the word technological difficulties?
[1867.92 → 1869.02] You heard of that before?
[1869.50 → 1870.54] Well, that's what I had.
[1870.68 → 1873.48] Basically, I couldn't figure out how to get the picture off my phone.
[1874.66 → 1876.58] So I'm going to be working on that this week.
[1876.72 → 1879.90] So next week, maybe we'll have some pictures of you guys jumping off.
[1881.02 → 1885.50] Does anybody remember what we were working on in children's worship time last Sunday in the backroom?
[1885.54 → 1886.76] What were we going to start talking about?
[1886.82 → 1887.68] Does anybody remember?
[1889.64 → 1889.84] What?
[1889.84 → 1894.40] That's good.
[1894.48 → 1895.80] We remember that part of the morning.
[1895.88 → 1896.34] That's good.
[1897.86 → 1899.16] What were we talking about in the backroom?
[1899.18 → 1900.56] What are we going to start learning about?
[1900.64 → 1901.74] What's the first book in the Bible?
[1901.80 → 1902.72] Remember we talked about that?
[1902.78 → 1903.74] What's the name of that book?
[1903.86 → 1904.34] Nora, do you know?
[1905.28 → 1905.60] Genesis.
[1905.76 → 1907.36] So we're going to start talking about Genesis today.
[1907.44 → 1908.20] Are you excited about that?
[1908.84 → 1909.16] Yeah?
[1909.30 → 1909.76] That's good.
[1910.44 → 1910.78] All right.
[1910.88 → 1912.26] How about we do the children's...
[1912.26 → 1914.62] Actually, I'm going to pray with you guys first, and then we'll do the blessings.
[1914.72 → 1915.24] Does that sound good?
[1916.06 → 1916.36] All right.
[1916.84 → 1918.30] Heavenly Father, thank you for this day.
[1918.50 → 1919.48] Thank you for these children.
[1919.82 → 1922.56] Thank you that we had the opportunity to be here this morning to learn about you.
[1923.36 → 1929.90] Please bless the teachers and all of us in the rooms in the back as we share your word with these children.
[1930.10 → 1931.04] For Jesus' sake, amen.
[1932.62 → 1935.74] Okay, if we can get everybody to stand up, including the kids here.
[1937.10 → 1938.36] We know how to do this, right?
[1940.72 → 1941.34] Everybody ready?
[1942.54 → 1944.94] The Lord be with you.
[1945.24 → 1947.20] And all of us will be.
[1969.46 → 1972.96] It's nice seeing all these kids leave the sanctuary again, isn't it?
[1972.96 → 1975.86] I feel like that's been a little while since we've been able to do that.
[1977.14 → 1980.66] For those of you who are perhaps watching online or sitting here today, my name is Kevin Robert.
[1980.70 → 1983.48] I'm the youth pastor here at Langley Emanuel CRC.
[1983.94 → 1986.30] And it's my honour to be able to bring you...
[1986.30 → 1988.88] To lead you, sorry, in our church family prayer.
[1989.00 → 1990.96] So if you'll all bow your heads with me, we'll pray.
[1994.70 → 1995.62] Our Father in heaven,
[1995.62 → 1997.26] God, you are so great.
[1997.26 → 1998.34] God, you are so great.
[1998.92 → 2004.52] Lord, your gift of your son on the cross is something that we cannot even imagine.
[2004.86 → 2007.94] We cannot even fathom or begin to understand.
[2008.04 → 2011.40] And yet we know that because of that gift, Lord, we are saved.
[2012.62 → 2014.34] God, you have saved us from our sins.
[2014.44 → 2015.68] You saved us from death.
[2015.68 → 2020.82] And you will come back again to restore your world as you created it in the beginning.
[2022.10 → 2024.38] But God, it seems so far away sometimes.
[2024.66 → 2025.94] Lord, we think of the world right now.
[2026.02 → 2033.14] We think of so many of the disasters, the storms, the hurricanes, the earthquakes.
[2033.34 → 2034.66] We think of countries like Haiti.
[2036.44 → 2040.04] And God, sometimes it's so hard to imagine that you can come and restore this.
[2040.26 → 2041.58] God, we pray for the people of Haiti.
[2041.58 → 2047.30] We pray for the people around the world who are struggling because of weather, because of storms,
[2047.86 → 2049.34] or people who have been displaced.
[2050.66 → 2052.26] And God, we lift them up to you.
[2052.50 → 2054.14] God, may you restore their homes.
[2054.68 → 2055.82] May you restore their families.
[2056.22 → 2059.78] Lord, we think of places in the world where people are experiencing persecution.
[2060.20 → 2061.84] Christians, but other religions as well.
[2061.92 → 2063.60] People who are dying for what they believe.
[2064.70 → 2070.42] Lord, we pray especially for those Christians in the world who are being killed for proclaiming you as Lord.
[2071.58 → 2078.14] God, may you continue to give them the conviction that they have.
[2078.74 → 2083.08] And may you somehow work in the midst of all of this for your kingdom's glory.
[2083.54 → 2084.88] Lord, there are many people who are scared.
[2085.04 → 2088.10] There are people living in refugee camps who aren't home anymore, God.
[2088.12 → 2089.90] And again, we ask that you be with them.
[2089.96 → 2090.72] We think of our churches.
[2090.90 → 2093.96] We are looking to sponsor another refugee family, hopefully soon down the road.
[2094.32 → 2100.12] God, may you be with that process as well and be with that family as they await news and more information on that.
[2100.12 → 2102.20] Lord, we think of our country right now.
[2102.26 → 2103.70] This past week we had an election, Lord.
[2103.98 → 2105.16] Some of us are perhaps happy.
[2105.26 → 2106.48] Some of us are perhaps frustrated.
[2106.62 → 2107.68] Some of us are perhaps angry.
[2108.24 → 2111.84] Lord, whatever the case, this is the leadership that is in our country.
[2111.90 → 2113.30] And we pray that you will be with them.
[2113.90 → 2115.68] God, bring your kingdom to this country.
[2115.82 → 2117.18] Help them lead with integrity.
[2118.46 → 2122.76] God, put the right people in the ears of these leaders to whisper your truth.
[2122.76 → 2124.00] The truth.
[2125.20 → 2126.66] So that they will lead out of that.
[2129.20 → 2130.40] Lord, we lift this church.
[2130.52 → 2132.38] There are some concerns in this church as well.
[2132.44 → 2133.28] People who are struggling.
[2133.44 → 2136.74] We think of Chris and Rachel and Bill and Miriam today, God.
[2136.80 → 2138.06] Their house was flooded this week.
[2138.94 → 2143.52] And they are now relocating and renovating for the next little while for the foreseeable future, God.
[2143.54 → 2144.82] We pray for patience for them.
[2144.92 → 2146.66] We pray for expedience for this process.
[2146.66 → 2154.12] We pray for integrity for the workers and those who are helping with the insurance side of things and the construction site of things.
[2154.22 → 2157.66] And just pray that that all comes together smoothly.
[2159.46 → 2165.42] Lord, this pandemic has dominated our conversations over the past year and a half, Lord.
[2165.52 → 2167.32] And it is striking very close to home.
[2167.58 → 2173.00] We pray for the many people in our church right now who are dealing with this disease.
[2173.00 → 2176.20] For those who have family members who are sick.
[2176.20 → 2178.70] God, we think especially of Karen.
[2178.88 → 2185.98] We pray for her and her family as they think of Martin, her dad, who is in the hospital on life support on a ventilator right now.
[2186.16 → 2189.52] God, may your miraculous healing enter his body.
[2190.22 → 2195.12] We pray for the family as they patiently wait to see if that will help.
[2195.16 → 2199.02] We think of Sarah's brother, Patrick, who is also in critical condition in CAME because of COVID.
[2199.32 → 2200.46] God, bring healing to him.
[2200.72 → 2202.26] Be with Sarah and her family as well.
[2202.26 → 2210.66] Lord, we think especially of Peter and Grace and Lucy in Grand Forks, Lord, who lost their wife and their mom to COVID just two weeks ago.
[2211.56 → 2212.68] Lord, it's so hard.
[2212.82 → 2213.42] Be near them.
[2213.56 → 2217.50] Surround them with people who love them, who reach out to them, who encourage them.
[2217.56 → 2218.50] God, who can help them.
[2219.22 → 2223.14] Be especially with Peter and those girls as they learn to live life.
[2223.40 → 2228.28] Learn to live their lives without their mom and without their wife.
[2228.28 → 2229.82] Lord, we think of Clary's dad.
[2229.90 → 2234.36] We're thankful that he is back home right now, but he has a long road of recovery as well from COVID.
[2234.78 → 2237.48] Help that recovery to happen, to go well, to go smoothly.
[2238.34 → 2241.22] Just be with him as he looks like he's going to be a long hauler right now too.
[2241.34 → 2245.08] And Lord, there are many others who are affected by this pandemic, and we just ask that you bring healing.
[2246.02 → 2248.94] Lord, be with us all during this time.
[2250.38 → 2253.84] Let this pandemic not divide us, Lord.
[2253.84 → 2258.14] We all have different opinions on this.
[2259.12 → 2262.10] Different opinions on how we are to go about living because of this.
[2263.14 → 2266.26] But God, let this not sever our church.
[2266.66 → 2269.34] Let this not sever our relationships.
[2269.62 → 2271.10] Let this not sever the body.
[2272.26 → 2278.30] Give us gracious hearts, listening ears, sympathetic minds.
[2279.70 → 2282.28] Let us be united even when we see this differently.
[2282.28 → 2285.98] God, we think of other health concerns that are happening right now.
[2286.28 → 2288.78] There are many struggling in silence, Lord.
[2288.90 → 2292.02] The silent health concerns like anxiety, depression, mental health, God.
[2292.08 → 2294.22] Be present in those situations.
[2294.38 → 2295.58] Be present in those lives.
[2296.04 → 2301.38] Surround them too with people who can listen and be near and support as best as they know how.
[2301.54 → 2306.36] We think of those who are struggling with cancer or dementia or heart conditions, Lord.
[2306.40 → 2308.18] There's many other physical afflictions.
[2308.18 → 2310.16] God, we just pray for them too.
[2311.92 → 2315.88] Be near to everyone, Lord, who is struggling with their health right now.
[2316.94 → 2318.12] And God, we lift this church.
[2318.24 → 2319.94] It's the start of a new ministry year today.
[2320.04 → 2322.90] God, we are saddened that we can't have this festival to kick off the year.
[2322.96 → 2324.74] And yet, we are still moving forward, God.
[2324.94 → 2330.12] Thank you for so many volunteers in this church willing to step up in another fairly uncertain year, God.
[2330.16 → 2334.02] And we just pray that you continue to be with them and motivate them in their ministries.
[2334.02 → 2339.62] May they lead these ministries and serve in these ministries seeking you first.
[2340.10 → 2343.32] And may your spirit move amongst them so that others are drawn closer to God.
[2343.64 → 2349.38] And, Lord, those that are in need of more volunteers, we pray that you'll stir in the hearts of those members in this church who could serve in those capacities.
[2349.58 → 2354.72] May you encourage them and bring them to these coordinators so that they can serve.
[2354.86 → 2358.62] And, God, may these ministries bring you glory and draw others to you.
[2358.62 → 2363.28] And now, God, as we turn to your word, be with Pastor Chris as he brings us your word.
[2363.34 → 2366.20] May he step out of the way so that your words come through.
[2366.58 → 2372.28] And may you give us all open ears and minds and hearts to receive what it is that you are teaching us today.
[2373.52 → 2376.40] We pray this all in your son's precious and holy name.
[2377.08 → 2377.34] Amen.
[2388.62 → 2403.82] As Kevin prayed, we're going to spend some time in God's word this morning.
[2403.90 → 2408.66] We're going to do it a little bit differently this morning because of the Sunday that it is.
[2409.54 → 2412.34] And so you've heard it a couple of times.
[2412.44 → 2414.52] It's the ministry year kickoff.
[2414.52 → 2429.14] We're starting different ministries over the next week or two as we return into some form of life lived together, doing ministry together.
[2429.94 → 2441.02] And for myself, I think this is a perfect time to reflect on why we do what we do and the direction that we are setting in the midst of that.
[2441.02 → 2451.92] And so this morning will be for us a little bit like, if you're familiar with American politics, I'll be careful what I say next.
[2451.96 → 2452.26] Don't worry.
[2453.02 → 2458.62] Every year, the sort of season of work begins with the State of the Union Address.
[2459.32 → 2470.80] In Canadian politics, we have the throne speech that happens, right, where the government sort of outlines their agenda based on the celebrations and successes of the past and how they're going to go forward.
[2471.02 → 2473.78] And this is sort of the same thing.
[2474.20 → 2482.24] And so for us, this is a state of the vision or a state of the mission as we step into this next year.
[2482.24 → 2499.34] Now, we all know that this next year of ministry and mission together is going to look different, not only because we've got new things, and we're excited about where God is taking us, but because we continue to deal with the effects of COVID and the pandemic.
[2499.34 → 2503.70] And that impacts how we do ministry and mission together.
[2503.70 → 2526.64] And yet, recognizing that some of those things will be different for good reasons and some of those things will be different for bad reasons, I still think it's important for us at the beginning to both celebrate what God is doing in our midst and to look at the stories of God at work in the world through us, his church, here individually in our own lives.
[2526.64 → 2538.14] And through us and through us and through us and through us and through us and through us and through us in the community beyond and even further than that in the world as we partner with different agencies and denominations and even send people out from this place.
[2538.14 → 2543.74] And so we begin in celebration, and we begin in anticipation.
[2546.00 → 2557.32] One of the beautiful truths about being a Christian, about living life out of our particular faith, is that we expect God to show up.
[2558.84 → 2563.70] We really believe that God is an active agent in the world.
[2563.70 → 2570.74] And so what would it look like for us as a church to operate in that way in all that we do?
[2571.92 → 2581.34] Expecting that God will show up and maybe even adding a little bit of urgency to what we do, leading God to show up.
[2582.52 → 2591.38] And so like we said, every once in a while it's important to reflect on the mission statement of the church and to see how we are doing what we are doing,
[2591.38 → 2593.86] to see why we are doing what we are doing.
[2593.98 → 2603.76] And so in the grand scheme of things, because this is ministry year kickoff and because we are in the midst and Lord willing at coming out of,
[2603.84 → 2611.20] but definitely in a time of change with this pandemic, this is exactly the time to ask these kinds of questions.
[2612.20 → 2620.58] To wonder about what we do and to wonder if we should keep doing it or to wonder if we should keep doing it in the way that we have been doing it.
[2621.38 → 2628.96] And so to ground us, just a little bit of history and then we'll spend some time together.
[2629.96 → 2632.70] Now this history, most of it predates me.
[2633.30 → 2637.96] And so I'm coming alongside of work that's been done for years in advance.
[2638.08 → 2643.44] But in 2015 in this community, there was a discernment committee.
[2644.84 → 2646.28] Naming is hard for churches.
[2646.28 → 2648.92] And so we stick with things like discernment committee.
[2649.54 → 2659.52] But this discernment committee was tasked with looking at the old mission statement and in doing so found that it was time for a change.
[2660.22 → 2666.36] In 2018, there was a town hall meeting that happened that the church participated in.
[2666.36 → 2674.50] And it was decided to add a third element or aspect to that previous mission statement, a specifically mission one.
[2675.60 → 2681.68] And then coming out of that, there were a number of changes that took place and new teams and committees were started.
[2681.94 → 2689.44] And then in 2019, the council, which is the group that sort of governs the activity and function of church,
[2690.02 → 2694.48] council approved and presented the following mission statement.
[2694.48 → 2695.80] Now don't put it on the screen yet.
[2697.70 → 2700.76] Because before we put it on the screen, this is always telling.
[2701.92 → 2703.60] Can anyone tell me what it is?
[2703.74 → 2706.80] Now preferably not a staff person or a council person.
[2707.78 → 2710.02] What is our church mission statement?
[2715.16 → 2718.30] Okay, with a little bit more confidence because I think one of you knows it.
[2720.72 → 2722.96] Gather, grow, go.
[2722.96 → 2726.26] I'm not going to say very good because it was adequate.
[2728.42 → 2730.46] Gather, grow, go.
[2730.60 → 2731.58] Now, what does that mean?
[2731.68 → 2732.54] We can flesh that out.
[2732.62 → 2733.94] Now you can put it on the screen, Levi.
[2734.10 → 2734.56] Thank you.
[2735.16 → 2735.30] Right?
[2735.62 → 2739.36] Gathering together to glorify God and encourage one another.
[2740.04 → 2746.58] Being Christ's disciples by uniting with each other for worship services, fellowship events, and social occasions.
[2746.58 → 2748.16] Or grow.
[2748.16 → 2751.76] Growing in our trust, knowledge, and love of the Lord.
[2751.88 → 2758.22] Building up as Christ's disciples by engaging each other in biblical teaching, discussions, and prayer.
[2758.68 → 2765.16] And then go, this is what was added later, and explicitly going out as Christ's ambassadors in this world.
[2765.16 → 2772.42] Making disciples of all nations by sharing the gospel, living lives of service, and caring for people's needs.
[2772.42 → 2776.14] Now, that sounds beautiful.
[2777.22 → 2778.46] That sounds lovely.
[2779.50 → 2780.58] But what does it mean?
[2781.34 → 2786.24] And really, if you're involved in the ministry and mission of this church, when was the last time you thought about it?
[2787.18 → 2793.94] When was the last time it was brought in front of your work together as different teams or committees or opportunities to serve?
[2793.94 → 2801.74] And then, after we realized that maybe we could be doing a more adequate job, how are we living it out?
[2803.08 → 2812.80] What is a new thing or the new way or a new direction that God might be calling us to in faithful response to this mission statement?
[2813.94 → 2818.50] That's what I want us to reflect on this morning at the beginning of this ministry year.
[2818.50 → 2840.26] Now, it's important to say that what we do and who we are as a church, we want to be shaped by and informed by and determined by what the Bible teaches.
[2840.96 → 2845.22] What the Bible shows us as Christians.
[2845.22 → 2851.10] What the Bible says is that we believe as Christians that the Bible is the Word of God.
[2852.02 → 2859.98] And that this means for us that it is God's Word for life and for new life and for redemption in Jesus.
[2860.64 → 2868.00] And it is God's Word for how we are to live this new life, this redemption life in Him.
[2868.00 → 2877.30] The gospel is the grace of God for new life, and it is the life that we live out of grace.
[2879.20 → 2893.62] What I want to suggest to you that for us this morning to live this gospel mission life is to live a life that is radically obedient to the Word of God.
[2893.62 → 2906.06] Now, for some of you, you hear language like radical obedience and flags start going up, and you're going to challenge me on legalism, and you're going to push back, and you're not going to like what I'm about to say and that's good.
[2906.42 → 2913.74] I want you to be a little bit uncomfortable here because maybe we've grown a little apathetic in our life and faith.
[2913.74 → 2919.58] But when I talk about radical obedience to God in the gospel, I mean that in two ways.
[2919.70 → 2921.12] Radical in two ways.
[2921.22 → 2927.36] Now, the word radical comes from the Latin word meaning from radix, which means root.
[2927.94 → 2928.12] Right?
[2928.16 → 2929.30] So like the root of a tree.
[2929.78 → 2941.46] And here, when we talk about radical obedience, what we're talking about is connecting to God's original design and intent and purposes for human flourishing.
[2941.46 → 2942.38] Right?
[2942.54 → 2952.14] Connecting back to the creational norms and structures that God built into the world order when he spoke it into being.
[2953.90 → 2965.86] What it means to be fully human, fully alive, is to live in the design of God for life, for his glory.
[2967.48 → 2969.88] That's one sense of radical obedience.
[2969.88 → 2981.58] But also radical in the sense of outlandish or peculiar or otherworldly.
[2982.54 → 2982.64] Right?
[2983.04 → 2986.98] One way to put it is to say that it's counter-cultural.
[2987.94 → 2988.02] Right?
[2988.08 → 2998.20] As Christians striving to live as faithful witnesses of Jesus in the world, there are certain aspects of our culture that we just have to say no to.
[2998.20 → 3001.76] That we have to look different from.
[3002.08 → 3010.62] Because the reality, of course, is that if the church of Jesus looks exactly the same as the non-church of Jesus, what's the point of the church of Jesus?
[3010.62 → 3022.06] And so, in a world of perpetual busyness, which is clearly an idol that is held up and celebrated in our culture, and as Christians we are not immune to this.
[3022.06 → 3032.60] But in a world that is celebrating perpetual busyness, something like Sabbath rest, like resting in Jesus, is counter-cultural.
[3032.60 → 3045.36] In a world of what social philosophers are calling expressive individualism, submitting yourself to a covenant community is counter-cultural.
[3045.36 → 3056.88] In a world full of sexual promiscuity, raising the bar of our sexual ethics is not normal, and yet that's exactly what the scriptures do.
[3058.48 → 3067.72] In a world of casual and unreflected upon consumption, fasting doesn't make sense.
[3067.72 → 3073.34] And yet Jesus presumes that we will be doing it.
[3074.54 → 3076.94] And on and on goes.
[3076.94 → 3089.12] And as Christians, who believe in the word of God, who believe in the spirit of God to make that word true in our hearts and in our lives,
[3089.48 → 3097.90] we actually believe that this kind of radical obedience is not only good and right, but it's possible for how we live in the world.
[3098.72 → 3098.86] Right?
[3098.86 → 3102.30] You can actually live this way.
[3103.56 → 3105.06] But you can't do it alone.
[3106.52 → 3109.38] But you need God to work in you.
[3109.48 → 3113.24] We need the word of God and the work of the spirit on you.
[3114.42 → 3116.74] And that work makes us part of a community.
[3117.44 → 3120.20] Part of a church family.
[3122.32 → 3123.72] And we get together.
[3124.94 → 3128.04] In fact, we get to gather.
[3128.04 → 3132.98] So that's the first point of our mission statement.
[3133.18 → 3133.70] To gather.
[3134.28 → 3134.42] Right?
[3134.52 → 3140.76] From the very beginning of the church of Jesus, we gathered.
[3141.54 → 3142.10] Right?
[3142.16 → 3152.48] From the upper room waiting for the Holy Spirit on Pentecost to other rooms and homes and back corners of temples in Judaism early on throughout the Roman Empire.
[3152.96 → 3156.42] Christians gather as brothers and sisters.
[3156.42 → 3160.94] Hear this from Hebrews 10.
[3162.76 → 3164.92] I'm going to read starting in verse 23.
[3164.92 → 3171.42] Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess.
[3171.42 → 3173.68] For he who promised is faithful.
[3173.68 → 3181.00] And let us consider how we may spur one another onward toward love and good deeds.
[3181.26 → 3186.48] Not giving up meeting together as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another.
[3186.94 → 3191.56] And all the more as you see the day approaching.
[3191.56 → 3197.34] Consider how we may spur one another on.
[3197.90 → 3199.00] That's why we gather.
[3199.50 → 3199.64] Right?
[3199.64 → 3201.70] To spur one another on.
[3202.52 → 3202.66] Right?
[3202.72 → 3207.68] And then not giving up meeting as some are in the habit of doing.
[3207.68 → 3215.48] Church of Jesus Christ exists to gather together.
[3217.48 → 3225.52] The first place we do that is here on Sunday, on the Lord's Day, around his word.
[3226.02 → 3227.36] Sing praises to him.
[3227.84 → 3228.66] Offer prayers.
[3229.02 → 3232.56] Respond in our gratitude and charity in giving.
[3233.06 → 3235.72] And to submit ourselves to God.
[3235.72 → 3240.28] There's a quote from Martin Luther.
[3241.28 → 3243.08] It says, Luther says,
[3243.40 → 3248.12] At home, in my own house, there is no warmth or vigour in me.
[3248.98 → 3260.20] But in the church, when the multitude is gathered together, a fire is kindled in my heart, and it breaks its way through.
[3261.16 → 3263.76] There's a beautiful image here.
[3263.76 → 3281.00] And in fact, this image was made really clear to me in a conversation I had a number of years ago with a person who was trying to talk to me about how they were trying to be a Christian without being part of a church.
[3281.00 → 3288.88] And so this illustration is that you've got a campfire burning when it is safe and seasonally appropriate to do so.
[3288.88 → 3292.88] You've got a campfire burning with a campfire burning with a number of logs on it.
[3292.88 → 3296.64] And you pull one of those logs out of the fire, and you set it off by the side.
[3296.64 → 3299.96] Now that log is going to continue to burn for a little while.
[3301.46 → 3303.40] And this fire is just going to keep burning.
[3304.14 → 3305.24] It's going to keep going.
[3306.40 → 3310.22] But in due order, this individual log burns out.
[3311.26 → 3316.44] It had enough self-sustaining fuel which it could consume for a period of time.
[3316.44 → 3318.42] And then it peters out.
[3318.54 → 3321.12] And then this one kept on burning.
[3323.40 → 3326.74] So how can you be a Christian, or how long can you be a Christian without a church?
[3327.44 → 3328.38] Not very long.
[3329.20 → 3334.18] But one of the beautiful testimonies about this illustration too is if you take that log after it's gone out and put it back in the fire,
[3334.18 → 3338.16] almost instantly it's burning again bright with the rest of them.
[3339.94 → 3340.04] Right?
[3340.34 → 3345.32] Gathering together in the large body is critical for who we are.
[3345.62 → 3348.92] And so let us not give up meeting together as some are in the habit of doing,
[3349.00 → 3353.68] but encourage one another and all the more as you see the day approaching.
[3354.80 → 3357.20] This struck me this week as I was reflecting on this, right?
[3357.26 → 3360.18] This all the more as you see the day approaching.
[3360.18 → 3365.52] The reality is we need more of our gathering together, not less.
[3366.34 → 3375.44] Because the day in scriptures, that phrase, the day is used as a way to refer to the full in breaking of the kingdom of God,
[3375.50 → 3382.52] the return of Jesus Christ, the end of history as it were, the consummation of God's drama of redemption.
[3382.94 → 3386.48] As we wait for that day, what we know is that every day we're getting closer.
[3386.48 → 3391.24] And so because it's closer today than it was when this was first written,
[3391.42 → 3394.16] we need to be getting together more, not less.
[3394.26 → 3400.60] And yet there's some impulse in our culture to try and do less and less and less.
[3400.60 → 3412.52] And even so, increasingly we find ourselves living in the midst of what many are calling a post-Christian reality.
[3412.52 → 3421.56] And if that's true, that we are finding ourselves in this post-Christian reality and will only in increasing measure,
[3421.94 → 3427.24] what we need are thick and deep communities in order to endure that reality.
[3427.24 → 3434.20] Right now things are still relatively safe and easy for us as Christians.
[3434.62 → 3438.00] There are challenges and some of us face more of them in different ways.
[3438.10 → 3441.06] If you're involved in politics, particularly when you try to be a faithful Christian,
[3441.32 → 3443.50] you know the challenges that you face.
[3445.00 → 3450.00] The way and the only way, I believe, that we might endure this ever-increasing reality
[3450.00 → 3453.74] is to have these deep gathered communities.
[3453.74 → 3458.72] There's something here about the power of liturgy,
[3458.84 → 3462.98] the power of the regular coming into the presence of God
[3462.98 → 3467.72] and being ushered to Him as He welcomes us and greets us,
[3467.82 → 3470.94] as we are called to sing praises to Him,
[3471.16 → 3475.66] as we acknowledge our utter dependence upon Him in prayer and in confession,
[3476.00 → 3477.74] as we long to encounter God.
[3477.74 → 3485.06] There's a power to this regular, habitual forming that God can do.
[3489.40 → 3494.18] Another quote from John Piper who talks about worship
[3494.18 → 3501.54] and how this shapes us and drives and defines us as Christians.
[3501.74 → 3502.26] Piper says,
[3502.26 → 3532.26] 
[3532.26 → 3537.66] And that remains true and vital for who we are.
[3539.36 → 3544.46] But it's not just in our worship, at least not just in our worship here, right?
[3544.48 → 3547.26] Because we're pretty good at that here, right?
[3547.30 → 3549.52] Our church loves to sing.
[3549.52 → 3555.12] One of the things that in my interview process and time and time again in meetings
[3555.12 → 3558.84] and as we're making adjustments to services over and over and over again,
[3558.88 → 3559.92] it becomes abundantly clear.
[3559.98 → 3560.60] As people say to me,
[3560.90 → 3562.20] We love to sing.
[3563.08 → 3564.74] And there are times when we are gathered here
[3564.74 → 3568.24] and I really believe that our singing is pushing back the gates of hell.
[3569.80 → 3570.96] We're good at singing.
[3570.96 → 3577.36] And we have been growing in our capacity to experience and to provide worship
[3577.36 → 3582.40] from the physical space that's been changing to our online space, right?
[3582.42 → 3587.96] We've been working hard in this and to connecting again in gathered worship, right?
[3588.02 → 3592.76] To experience the heart of God in worship, right?
[3592.80 → 3596.22] And like Psalm 33 calls us, Psalm 33 says,
[3596.22 → 3600.88] Sing to Him a new song, play skilfully, and shout for joy, right?
[3600.88 → 3605.14] We have been learning new songs, and we've been singing powerful old songs.
[3605.26 → 3611.16] We are playing skilfully and ever trying to increase our standard of excellence, right?
[3611.16 → 3614.98] We are shouting for joy, and we are crying in sorrow.
[3616.08 → 3619.46] And maybe you're not a hand raiser or a crier in worship,
[3619.46 → 3624.22] but we are all being drawn closer to God and a meaningful experience of Him.
[3625.68 → 3627.78] And maybe you haven't started that journey
[3627.78 → 3631.36] or maybe you're on a temporary way station along that journey.
[3631.50 → 3633.60] Maybe you are standing on a mountaintop
[3633.60 → 3635.36] and you are calling down to the rest of us
[3635.36 → 3638.48] the glories of the goodness of God and calling us up.
[3638.98 → 3644.20] The point is, right, we are together journeying in our worship.
[3646.16 → 3649.50] But it's more than just the worship that we gather for.
[3651.24 → 3651.38] Right?
[3651.52 → 3654.42] Gather means also other spaces.
[3654.42 → 3658.38] Yes, Lord's Supper tables, but also dining tables.
[3659.36 → 3660.58] Yes, church chairs.
[3660.98 → 3663.60] These are maybe, Lord willing, sometime in the future new ones,
[3663.74 → 3665.12] but also living room chairs.
[3666.02 → 3666.14] Right?
[3666.20 → 3667.04] Living room sofas.
[3667.94 → 3672.48] Meeting rooms and waiting rooms as you're in the hospital.
[3673.98 → 3676.56] Small groups or other groups.
[3676.56 → 3677.22] Right?
[3677.22 → 3685.88] If your experience of church community is only from 10 a.m. to 1130, 1145, I don't know,
[3685.94 → 3689.70] we'll see how the time goes this morning, on Sunday, you're not really getting it.
[3691.08 → 3691.52] Right?
[3691.56 → 3693.68] And I'm not saying that we all need to be best friends.
[3694.64 → 3694.82] Right?
[3694.82 → 3698.28] I'm not saying that you all need to invite everybody else here to your birthday parties.
[3699.06 → 3700.58] Although I would love a birthday invitation.
[3700.58 → 3704.54] What I'm saying is that we are brothers and sisters.
[3705.34 → 3709.56] And that doesn't stop when you walk out the doors after service on Sunday.
[3710.04 → 3712.60] In fact, that's when it really starts to matter.
[3713.94 → 3717.52] And in this area, I believe we can grow.
[3718.62 → 3720.74] In this area, we can do more.
[3720.74 → 3724.94] I've been meeting with some of the leaders of the different ministries and teams,
[3725.14 → 3726.10] committees around here.
[3726.94 → 3729.42] And we know that we can do more.
[3730.54 → 3730.66] Right?
[3730.70 → 3736.62] And in part of that, we're rebranding and expanding some of the work of what was called the fellowship
[3736.62 → 3737.02] committee.
[3737.18 → 3740.06] And we're now going to identify that as a manual connect.
[3740.54 → 3743.08] Because we recognize this reality.
[3743.36 → 3743.46] Right?
[3743.50 → 3744.90] We need connection.
[3745.52 → 3747.64] We need an experience of belonging.
[3748.04 → 3749.66] We need more meals together.
[3749.66 → 3751.60] Big meals and little meals.
[3751.74 → 3756.94] Here after service, but also on Thursday where two or three might just gather.
[3758.36 → 3761.70] We need to connect in prayer groups more than we are.
[3762.08 → 3765.82] And to that end, I'm looking for more people to step into the prayer ministry.
[3765.96 → 3767.74] And so if that's on your heart, connect with me.
[3768.98 → 3769.14] Right?
[3769.14 → 3770.26] We need to study together.
[3770.36 → 3773.58] We need to enter into relationships of mentoring and discipleship.
[3774.46 → 3776.38] Now, let me be really clear on this.
[3776.38 → 3780.44] Don't hear what I'm not saying because I know that some of you, I know that a bunch of you,
[3780.56 → 3782.16] are already doing this.
[3783.08 → 3785.32] And we need your leadership, and we need your example.
[3786.52 → 3790.22] And I know that many of you are doing this in your little spheres of influence and you
[3790.22 → 3795.04] are content to work quietly in the dark corners of need, and you don't want recognition.
[3795.40 → 3798.18] And I just want to say, I praise God for your faithfulness.
[3798.18 → 3801.50] And I know that all of that is true.
[3801.86 → 3808.22] And yet, I also know that the best antidote to a consumer Christianity that makes it about me
[3808.22 → 3812.98] and what I can get out of it is to serve others and to be connected to others.
[3814.08 → 3817.56] People who are different than you, who think different than you, who are older than you,
[3817.62 → 3818.58] who are younger than you.
[3819.08 → 3819.20] Right?
[3819.20 → 3823.20] To share a table and a prayer with someone who has more wisdom than you,
[3823.28 → 3826.68] with someone who has totally different life experiences than you.
[3826.68 → 3829.40] And if you heard me say that, and you thought,
[3829.50 → 3832.36] there's nobody here with more wisdom than me, you need this more than everyone.
[3834.00 → 3834.16] Right?
[3834.20 → 3839.04] This is what it means to be radically obedient in a culture of echo chambers
[3839.04 → 3844.30] and entrenched, homogeneous communities that are just perpetuated by algorithms
[3844.30 → 3846.52] and polarization and Google and Facebook.
[3846.80 → 3848.56] The church needs to be different.
[3848.68 → 3849.92] The church should be better.
[3850.22 → 3851.98] We can be better.
[3853.84 → 3856.08] And when we disagree with each other,
[3856.68 → 3858.20] we should come together.
[3859.50 → 3860.70] Not drive away.
[3861.34 → 3862.16] Not drive apart.
[3863.12 → 3863.86] But connect.
[3864.32 → 3867.74] And with gentleness and respect, seek to understand.
[3868.40 → 3868.54] Right?
[3868.54 → 3871.80] When we get hurt or when we hurt someone,
[3872.50 → 3876.12] we need to come together in love and reconciliation.
[3877.20 → 3877.30] Right?
[3877.36 → 3879.64] Instead of gossiping in the corners,
[3879.64 → 3882.44] we need to bring this struggle into the light.
[3883.10 → 3883.22] Right?
[3883.22 → 3885.14] We need to talk to different people,
[3885.40 → 3886.78] people who are different from us,
[3886.88 → 3889.10] and loving them and trying to understand them.
[3889.28 → 3891.24] Even if we may never agree,
[3891.50 → 3894.38] we need to push in rather than push away.
[3894.38 → 3899.56] A couple of weeks ago,
[3899.60 → 3902.16] I was talking to a friend of mine.
[3902.24 → 3904.06] He's not a believer,
[3904.20 → 3905.56] not a member of our church.
[3906.52 → 3911.20] We were talking about this whole COVID thing.
[3911.98 → 3913.60] He and I don't see eye to eye on this.
[3913.76 → 3914.56] That's very clear.
[3915.44 → 3917.00] But at the beginning of our conversation,
[3917.16 → 3917.78] he said to me,
[3918.22 → 3920.10] I believe that we as a society
[3920.10 → 3921.84] have forgotten how to disagree.
[3922.88 → 3925.00] That we've forgotten how to have good conversations
[3925.00 → 3926.86] wherein we can disagree
[3926.86 → 3928.98] and still be closely connected to each other.
[3929.54 → 3931.04] And I think he's absolutely right.
[3931.26 → 3933.30] But the unique thing about this conversation was,
[3933.72 → 3935.34] almost in the next breath,
[3935.46 → 3936.20] he said to me,
[3936.74 → 3938.48] you're not going to convince me of your way,
[3938.56 → 3940.20] and I know I'm not going to convince you of my way,
[3940.24 → 3940.92] so there's no point.
[3940.92 → 3943.52] You see the disconnect.
[3945.50 → 3947.12] But that's where we find ourselves.
[3947.70 → 3949.24] We know we should be doing better,
[3949.94 → 3951.76] and yet we don't make ourselves any better.
[3952.84 → 3953.42] Let me be clear.
[3954.36 → 3957.04] We need the Spirit to be made better.
[3957.38 → 3959.66] But this is the church, brothers and sisters.
[3959.86 → 3960.86] The Spirit is here.
[3961.40 → 3962.38] The Spirit is in you.
[3963.50 → 3965.86] We can be different.
[3966.52 → 3967.70] That's what it is to gather,
[3967.82 → 3969.88] whether it's on Sunday or every day.
[3969.88 → 3971.42] Not just for worship services,
[3971.56 → 3974.52] but in service of all life as worship.
[3976.16 → 3977.28] Don't miss this.
[3978.82 → 3982.40] Our gatherer has to serve a greater purpose.
[3983.16 → 3984.62] Otherwise, it's just another social club.
[3985.42 → 3989.82] Our gathering must lead to our growing.
[3991.84 → 3993.88] Gather, grow.
[3995.02 → 3999.08] The Christian life is measured by growth.
[3999.88 → 4001.62] Listen to this.
[4001.72 → 4003.22] This is from 2 Corinthians 3.
[4003.22 → 4010.00] Now the Lord is Spirit.
[4010.00 → 4013.34] And where the Spirit of the Lord is,
[4013.46 → 4014.14] there is freedom.
[4015.14 → 4017.34] And we all, with unveiled face,
[4017.46 → 4019.64] beholding the glory of the Lord,
[4019.74 → 4022.62] are being transformed into the same image
[4022.62 → 4025.72] from one degree of glory to another.
[4026.64 → 4028.58] For this comes from the Lord,
[4028.96 → 4030.62] who is Spirit.
[4030.62 → 4030.72] Spirit.
[4031.96 → 4034.60] You are being transformed.
[4035.68 → 4035.84] Right?
[4035.88 → 4038.70] Not just at the beginning of your faith life,
[4038.78 → 4040.86] not just at the beginning of your relationship
[4040.86 → 4043.00] into Jesus where we are transported from death
[4043.00 → 4045.40] into life when you first became a Christian,
[4045.66 → 4046.66] but throughout it all,
[4047.42 → 4050.76] right, God is making you more like Jesus.
[4051.60 → 4051.80] Right?
[4051.80 → 4054.18] And He does this in us through the Spirit
[4054.18 → 4055.36] and by the Gospel.
[4055.58 → 4056.66] Not just at the beginning,
[4056.92 → 4057.62] but all along.
[4057.70 → 4059.42] It is the Spirit, and it is the Gospel,
[4059.56 → 4060.32] time and time again,
[4060.62 → 4062.34] transforming our hearts and minds.
[4062.96 → 4065.96] The Christian life is one of growth.
[4067.10 → 4069.36] Now it may be incremental growth,
[4069.36 → 4070.82] and you may go through periods
[4070.82 → 4073.12] where it's growth by leaps and bounds.
[4073.52 → 4073.62] Right?
[4073.64 → 4075.72] Not unlike if you've raised kids before.
[4076.04 → 4077.80] You know that sometimes they just slowly,
[4078.22 → 4078.90] slowly grow,
[4079.20 → 4080.52] but then you sometimes know,
[4080.66 → 4082.22] like we're in right now with my kids,
[4082.32 → 4083.36] that three months later,
[4083.48 → 4084.86] their pants are six inches short.
[4085.72 → 4086.60] What happens?
[4087.10 → 4087.22] Right?
[4087.26 → 4088.80] Sometimes we jump like that.
[4089.00 → 4090.08] Now, in our faith,
[4090.30 → 4092.14] we also have lots of backsliding.
[4092.24 → 4093.42] There's also lots of failure.
[4094.06 → 4096.32] In fact, we're definitely going to have all of that,
[4096.32 → 4097.16] of incremental growth,
[4097.22 → 4098.08] and leaps and bounds growth,
[4098.18 → 4098.94] and failure,
[4099.08 → 4099.76] and backsliding.
[4100.18 → 4103.24] But, looking back on your life,
[4104.12 → 4106.60] you should see growth.
[4108.84 → 4110.72] Because God is faithful to His promise.
[4112.18 → 4114.98] The Spirit is here at work.
[4116.18 → 4118.08] The Christian life is one of growth,
[4118.46 → 4122.42] and the Christian church is one of growth.
[4123.36 → 4125.70] When people's lives are being transformed
[4125.70 → 4127.18] by the Spirit through the Word,
[4127.50 → 4131.64] when you are living examples of Christ come down,
[4131.92 → 4133.38] all other things being equal,
[4133.64 → 4135.30] the church will grow.
[4135.70 → 4138.14] People will be convicted and captivated.
[4138.44 → 4139.44] The beauty of God,
[4139.54 → 4141.00] and the beauty of the Gospel,
[4141.16 → 4142.94] and the beauty of His community,
[4143.30 → 4146.46] will touch people's imaginations and hearts,
[4146.70 → 4151.52] and will be drawn into a relationship to God.
[4151.52 → 4155.22] Now, even as I say that,
[4155.28 → 4156.78] I know that the problem is
[4156.78 → 4158.88] that not all things are equal.
[4161.30 → 4165.74] And that church growth
[4165.74 → 4169.36] can't be the only measure for church health.
[4170.12 → 4171.30] I am aware of that.
[4173.56 → 4176.06] And yet, we still want to hold out the reality.
[4176.06 → 4179.68] This is how God has formed us to be.
[4180.48 → 4182.12] God has designed us to be in particular
[4182.12 → 4183.74] sets of relationships
[4183.74 → 4186.40] that are going to allow for that
[4186.40 → 4187.70] to happen more easily
[4187.70 → 4190.32] in the church than in other places.
[4191.54 → 4193.50] Here, there's a discipleship model
[4193.50 → 4195.30] that I'm going to put in front of you
[4195.30 → 4197.18] that really is the discipleship model
[4197.18 → 4199.24] that our youth ministry here is based upon.
[4199.76 → 4201.10] And it's the discipleship model
[4201.10 → 4202.30] that I believe is most effective
[4202.30 → 4203.92] because it's the one that I think
[4203.92 → 4205.52] the scriptures most clearly reveal.
[4205.86 → 4207.56] It's the one that Jesus' own life
[4207.56 → 4209.50] was patterned after.
[4210.98 → 4211.34] Right?
[4211.50 → 4213.36] We've got a slide to put up.
[4213.66 → 4214.00] There you go.
[4214.06 → 4215.84] Now, I realize for those of you here,
[4215.96 → 4216.80] that might be hard to see.
[4216.88 → 4217.66] For those of you online,
[4217.74 → 4219.28] you're getting the better experience right now.
[4220.32 → 4222.10] But here is our discipleship model.
[4222.60 → 4224.56] And so, in the centre, there is you.
[4225.20 → 4226.76] So, you or you.
[4227.38 → 4227.62] Right?
[4227.70 → 4230.56] And then, above is a teacher.
[4230.56 → 4232.72] And so, all of us ought to be
[4232.72 → 4234.74] in a relationship with a teacher.
[4235.54 → 4237.56] Someone with whom we have deep,
[4237.86 → 4239.92] meaningful, intentional, Christ-forming,
[4240.26 → 4242.58] Christ-transforming kinds of relationships.
[4243.06 → 4245.96] And below you in the centre is a disciple.
[4246.76 → 4248.98] All of us should be in relationships
[4248.98 → 4250.10] where we are the teacher,
[4250.98 → 4252.44] where we are discipling someone,
[4252.54 → 4254.66] whether they're younger than us
[4254.66 → 4256.08] or younger than us in the faith.
[4256.54 → 4256.74] Right?
[4256.76 → 4258.68] There needs to be a relationship that way.
[4258.68 → 4260.98] And then, to the right and to the left,
[4261.10 → 4262.24] you've got small groups,
[4262.32 → 4264.06] as we are part of small groups
[4264.06 → 4264.90] of growing and learning.
[4265.02 → 4266.70] And to the left, you've got friend groups.
[4267.20 → 4267.34] Right?
[4267.38 → 4269.54] The people whom you socially hang out with.
[4269.64 → 4272.42] And again, it's hard to see here in the space,
[4272.52 → 4273.50] but those bottom three,
[4273.64 → 4274.94] the friend group, the disciple,
[4275.18 → 4277.42] and the small groups,
[4278.36 → 4280.12] they have a mesh on them.
[4280.22 → 4282.04] It's intended to convey
[4282.04 → 4283.52] that it's a porous community,
[4283.76 → 4285.52] that you are welcoming people in
[4285.52 → 4286.92] and people are transitioning
[4286.92 → 4288.78] to the next phase
[4288.78 → 4289.74] in their spiritual development.
[4289.80 → 4290.88] That is normal and good
[4290.88 → 4292.30] and it happens, right,
[4292.32 → 4293.82] as you are embracing people.
[4294.48 → 4296.06] But what this does, right,
[4296.10 → 4297.54] if you see yourself in the,
[4298.00 → 4300.72] also has the opportunity built within it
[4300.72 → 4301.74] to replicate itself.
[4301.86 → 4302.88] And so, go to the next one.
[4304.96 → 4307.78] And so, you become the disciple
[4307.78 → 4309.56] for someone else
[4309.56 → 4312.52] and or you become the teacher
[4312.52 → 4314.32] for someone else
[4314.32 → 4315.44] and then go to the next one.
[4316.34 → 4317.46] And then exponentially,
[4318.02 → 4320.60] this model begins to grow
[4320.60 → 4321.68] and then the final one
[4321.68 → 4323.82] where you have everybody
[4323.82 → 4325.22] in the church community,
[4325.46 → 4326.56] which is that big white circle
[4326.56 → 4327.22] that surrounds,
[4327.34 → 4328.34] because that's the context
[4328.34 → 4329.78] wherein these relationships
[4329.78 → 4331.30] are provided and happen.
[4332.58 → 4334.26] Everybody who's in the church community
[4334.26 → 4335.98] who is gathered
[4335.98 → 4338.00] into this way
[4338.00 → 4341.92] of being a faithful disciple of Jesus.
[4344.34 → 4347.46] And this is where we can grow.
[4348.76 → 4349.28] Because not all of us
[4349.28 → 4350.30] are connected in this way.
[4350.64 → 4351.72] Not all of us really believe
[4351.72 → 4353.68] we need to be connected in this way.
[4353.76 → 4354.86] And I know that it's really easy
[4354.86 → 4356.84] for some to sit on the peripheries,
[4357.18 → 4358.60] but we want to draw you in
[4358.60 → 4362.32] as we experience God together.
[4362.32 → 4365.24] So, our small groups
[4365.24 → 4366.08] and care groups
[4366.08 → 4368.22] have been working hard
[4368.22 → 4370.08] to invite new people.
[4371.20 → 4372.04] But what we need
[4372.04 → 4372.84] are people who are willing
[4372.84 → 4373.96] to facilitate.
[4375.30 → 4376.64] And let me be really clear, right?
[4376.76 → 4378.24] Facilitate doesn't have to mean lead.
[4378.50 → 4379.06] It doesn't have to mean
[4379.06 → 4380.30] that you run a curriculum
[4380.30 → 4380.80] and teach,
[4380.88 → 4381.64] but it means that you are
[4381.64 → 4382.54] the first person to email
[4382.54 → 4382.96] and say, hey,
[4382.98 → 4384.04] let's get together on this day.
[4385.16 → 4386.10] Or you're the first person
[4386.10 → 4386.80] to say, hey, you know what?
[4386.92 → 4388.20] I have a couch that's big enough
[4388.20 → 4389.50] to fit at least half of you on.
[4389.74 → 4390.80] Let's gather in my living room.
[4392.32 → 4395.20] We need to grow in this.
[4396.34 → 4397.40] And then I believe
[4397.40 → 4398.68] that becomes the context
[4398.68 → 4400.10] wherein we can also invite
[4400.10 → 4401.24] other people.
[4401.40 → 4402.90] So, we might begin again
[4402.90 → 4405.92] to experience growing number.
[4409.32 → 4414.68] Finally, and I'll say lastly,
[4414.68 → 4417.08] just like our gather
[4417.08 → 4418.80] has led to our growth,
[4419.74 → 4421.12] both of those together,
[4421.26 → 4422.16] gather and grow,
[4422.62 → 4425.02] must connect to go.
[4426.60 → 4427.58] Gathering together
[4427.58 → 4428.90] in worship and life,
[4429.32 → 4430.18] growing together
[4430.18 → 4432.06] in discipleship and mentoring
[4432.06 → 4433.94] will lead us out
[4433.94 → 4436.74] on mission with God.
[4437.24 → 4438.64] It will and must.
[4441.14 → 4442.70] Matthew 28, 17.
[4442.70 → 4444.66] When they saw him,
[4445.20 → 4446.10] they worshipped him,
[4447.04 → 4448.48] but some doubted.
[4449.32 → 4450.54] Then Jesus came to them
[4450.54 → 4451.02] and said,
[4451.50 → 4452.70] all authority in heaven
[4452.70 → 4453.20] and on earth
[4453.20 → 4454.06] has been given to me.
[4454.48 → 4454.80] Therefore,
[4455.60 → 4457.36] go and make disciples
[4457.36 → 4458.56] of all nations,
[4458.74 → 4459.54] baptizing them
[4459.54 → 4460.54] in the name of the Father
[4460.54 → 4461.64] and of the Son
[4461.64 → 4462.98] and of the Holy Spirit
[4462.98 → 4464.24] and teaching them
[4464.24 → 4465.56] to obey everything
[4465.56 → 4466.90] I have commanded you.
[4467.30 → 4468.00] And surely,
[4468.26 → 4469.40] I am with you
[4469.40 → 4471.32] always to the end
[4471.32 → 4472.24] of the age.
[4474.54 → 4475.88] Now, here is what we have
[4475.88 → 4476.48] come to call
[4476.48 → 4477.64] the Great Commission.
[4477.78 → 4478.72] But before we get into that,
[4478.76 → 4479.56] I want you to notice
[4479.56 → 4481.18] this mark.
[4481.52 → 4482.58] They saw him,
[4482.88 → 4483.96] they worshipped him,
[4484.10 → 4486.20] but some doubted.
[4487.66 → 4488.64] As a church,
[4488.68 → 4489.86] we have to make room
[4489.86 → 4490.76] for doubt.
[4490.76 → 4492.98] The disciples,
[4493.62 → 4494.52] people who lived
[4494.52 → 4495.34] with Jesus,
[4495.56 → 4496.60] who saw him
[4496.60 → 4497.66] after the resurrection,
[4498.08 → 4499.12] whom he appeared to
[4499.12 → 4500.78] and promised the power
[4500.78 → 4501.86] of the Holy Spirit to,
[4502.34 → 4503.12] they doubted.
[4504.16 → 4505.52] And if they doubted,
[4506.62 → 4507.46] surely we will too.
[4508.76 → 4509.54] And as a church,
[4509.60 → 4510.64] we need to make room
[4510.64 → 4511.72] for the doubter.
[4511.80 → 4512.64] We need to make room
[4512.64 → 4513.90] for the unbeliever
[4513.90 → 4515.60] to come into this place
[4515.60 → 4517.94] and experience
[4517.94 → 4519.44] that doubt
[4519.44 → 4520.68] to come into this place
[4520.68 → 4522.16] and to find answers.
[4522.24 → 4523.34] But not just for the unbeliever,
[4523.44 → 4524.22] for us.
[4524.32 → 4524.98] Earlier today,
[4525.06 → 4525.98] I was struck by this
[4525.98 → 4527.18] because we're singing
[4527.18 → 4528.72] the chorus in that song,
[4528.88 → 4529.62] For You Are Good,
[4530.00 → 4531.22] For You Are Good to Me.
[4532.20 → 4534.34] I'm singing that song today
[4534.34 → 4535.66] after a week
[4535.66 → 4536.46] where you heard
[4536.46 → 4538.20] that I had a
[4538.20 → 4540.30] water issue.
[4541.44 → 4542.82] And so most of my house
[4542.82 → 4544.44] needs to be gutted now
[4544.44 → 4545.46] and we're in the midst
[4545.46 → 4547.02] of this insurance thing
[4547.02 → 4548.14] and praise God,
[4548.22 → 4549.40] Rachel is taking the lead
[4549.40 → 4549.78] on that
[4549.78 → 4550.74] and so you can pray for her
[4550.74 → 4551.72] because she's a much better
[4551.72 → 4552.46] person than I am.
[4553.48 → 4554.48] But here we are
[4554.48 → 4555.96] in the midst of this chaos
[4555.96 → 4558.94] and I'm singing
[4558.94 → 4559.98] For You Are Good,
[4560.08 → 4560.96] For You Are Good to Me.
[4561.50 → 4562.30] Am I singing that
[4562.30 → 4562.86] as a believer?
[4563.02 → 4563.72] No, I'm singing that
[4563.72 → 4564.56] as I need to
[4564.56 → 4565.76] for this to be true.
[4567.12 → 4568.92] I need this to be true
[4568.92 → 4569.42] right now
[4569.42 → 4570.60] because the things
[4570.60 → 4571.12] in my life
[4571.12 → 4573.34] are making me wonder.
[4574.44 → 4577.40] we come together
[4577.40 → 4580.52] when we aren't sure,
[4580.90 → 4582.28] when we can't be sure
[4582.28 → 4583.92] to proclaim the truth
[4583.92 → 4584.42] that we know
[4584.42 → 4586.74] in spite of what we feel
[4586.74 → 4588.28] or in spite of those things
[4588.28 → 4589.10] that seem like evidence
[4589.10 → 4589.76] to the contrary
[4589.76 → 4591.42] because that's who God is,
[4591.60 → 4593.24] that's what His church does.
[4593.30 → 4594.00] We need to make room
[4594.00 → 4594.48] for doubt,
[4594.72 → 4595.30] make room
[4595.30 → 4597.22] to experience
[4597.22 → 4598.84] that reality.
[4598.84 → 4601.26] And then,
[4601.80 → 4603.70] in that context
[4603.70 → 4604.84] of worship and doubt,
[4605.48 → 4607.00] we hear that all authority
[4607.00 → 4607.66] in heaven and earth
[4607.66 → 4608.22] has been given
[4608.22 → 4609.10] to Jesus.
[4609.32 → 4609.92] And so the one
[4609.92 → 4611.10] who has been given
[4611.10 → 4612.48] all things
[4612.48 → 4613.76] and who has created
[4613.76 → 4614.38] all things
[4614.38 → 4615.28] and for whom
[4615.28 → 4616.44] all things were created
[4616.44 → 4618.20] says to you now,
[4618.58 → 4618.78] go.
[4618.78 → 4622.62] Go and make disciples.
[4623.32 → 4624.76] Go and teach them
[4624.76 → 4625.88] to obey.
[4626.08 → 4626.62] And notice that.
[4626.62 → 4627.72] The Great Commission is both,
[4627.94 → 4628.12] right?
[4628.18 → 4629.34] It's disciples
[4629.34 → 4630.34] making new disciples
[4630.34 → 4631.48] and teaching them
[4631.48 → 4633.18] to obey.
[4633.66 → 4634.00] Jesus,
[4634.30 → 4635.46] in John 20,
[4635.54 → 4636.10] verse 21,
[4636.26 → 4636.44] says,
[4636.58 → 4637.92] As the Father has sent me,
[4638.38 → 4640.18] so I am sending you.
[4640.34 → 4642.36] We are all sent.
[4643.04 → 4644.66] There's a beautiful quote
[4644.66 → 4646.14] from Emile Brunei
[4646.14 → 4646.74] and it picks up
[4646.74 → 4647.62] on that fire image
[4647.62 → 4648.42] from the beginning.
[4648.58 → 4649.88] Emile Brunei says,
[4650.08 → 4650.70] Mission work
[4650.70 → 4651.60] does not arise
[4651.60 → 4652.58] from any arrogance
[4652.58 → 4653.68] in the Christian church.
[4654.08 → 4655.62] Mission is its cause
[4655.62 → 4656.62] and its life.
[4657.50 → 4658.56] The church exists
[4658.56 → 4659.20] by mission
[4659.20 → 4660.42] just as fire
[4660.42 → 4661.78] exists by burning.
[4662.66 → 4663.90] Where there is no mission,
[4664.08 → 4665.26] there is no church.
[4665.46 → 4666.52] Where there is neither church
[4666.52 → 4667.16] nor mission,
[4667.58 → 4669.46] there is no faith.
[4671.84 → 4672.60] Some people,
[4672.78 → 4673.50] and this became
[4673.50 → 4674.16] really popular
[4674.16 → 4675.22] in the 90s
[4675.22 → 4676.30] and early 2000s,
[4676.56 → 4676.70] right,
[4676.74 → 4677.72] like to talk about
[4677.72 → 4679.20] mission Christianity.
[4680.16 → 4681.02] But I want to tell you,
[4681.06 → 4682.16] that's just redundant.
[4682.16 → 4684.58] To be Christian
[4684.58 → 4686.24] is to be mission.
[4686.54 → 4687.56] And I get the need,
[4687.62 → 4687.76] right,
[4687.78 → 4689.24] because we forgot about that
[4689.24 → 4689.64] and we became
[4689.64 → 4690.74] really insular communities.
[4690.90 → 4691.30] We didn't become
[4691.30 → 4692.56] outward-facing communities
[4692.56 → 4693.52] and so we need to be
[4693.52 → 4694.20] reminded of that truth.
[4694.26 → 4695.10] I understand that.
[4696.60 → 4698.62] But core to our identity
[4698.62 → 4700.10] as disciples of Jesus
[4700.10 → 4700.72] is the people
[4700.72 → 4702.12] who are sent
[4702.12 → 4703.02] and we cannot
[4703.02 → 4704.66] forget that.
[4705.80 → 4706.54] And I know that
[4706.54 → 4707.10] there are challenges.
[4707.22 → 4707.86] I hear it all the time,
[4707.92 → 4708.02] right?
[4708.04 → 4708.66] What if I don't have
[4708.66 → 4709.08] the answers?
[4709.66 → 4710.24] What if I don't know
[4710.24 → 4710.84] what to say?
[4711.72 → 4712.48] Which I want to say,
[4712.54 → 4713.20] well then learn.
[4714.72 → 4714.94] Right?
[4715.02 → 4716.08] I offer a class
[4716.08 → 4717.54] called How to Tell the Gospel.
[4718.78 → 4719.40] Maybe take that.
[4719.72 → 4721.14] But even more than that,
[4721.36 → 4721.84] hear this,
[4722.12 → 4723.90] if you really love something,
[4724.90 → 4726.04] you evangelize it.
[4727.82 → 4729.22] And I have a friend of mine
[4729.22 → 4731.60] who collects watches.
[4732.90 → 4733.66] Now, he is,
[4733.96 → 4735.20] he's a pastor
[4735.20 → 4735.98] in a small Christian
[4735.98 → 4736.50] Reformed church
[4736.50 → 4737.18] so he does not have
[4737.18 → 4737.84] the kind of money
[4737.84 → 4738.42] that it takes
[4738.42 → 4739.20] to be a perfect
[4739.20 → 4739.88] watch collector.
[4740.72 → 4741.70] But he knows
[4741.70 → 4742.22] where the local
[4742.22 → 4743.28] watch shops are
[4743.28 → 4744.64] and where those
[4744.64 → 4745.98] $12,000 Rolexes
[4745.98 → 4746.68] are on display.
[4747.60 → 4748.30] Once a week,
[4748.36 → 4748.96] he goes there
[4748.96 → 4749.96] just to see
[4749.96 → 4750.60] what the collection
[4750.60 → 4751.28] might be like.
[4752.46 → 4752.58] Right?
[4752.64 → 4752.92] And he,
[4753.44 → 4754.68] one time,
[4754.80 → 4755.42] I sat down
[4755.42 → 4755.92] in his house
[4755.92 → 4756.66] and he showed me
[4756.66 → 4757.84] his developing
[4757.84 → 4759.04] watch collection
[4759.04 → 4759.60] and he started
[4759.60 → 4760.42] talking about
[4760.42 → 4761.34] these watches
[4761.34 → 4762.00] and how they were
[4762.00 → 4762.74] handcrafted
[4762.74 → 4763.34] in Switzerland
[4763.34 → 4764.04] or how they were,
[4764.74 → 4764.94] you know,
[4765.02 → 4765.98] watches that could go
[4765.98 → 4767.12] 10,000 feet
[4767.12 → 4767.64] underwater
[4767.64 → 4768.46] and whatever
[4768.46 → 4769.38] the case may be.
[4769.38 → 4771.20] And I have to tell you,
[4771.42 → 4773.78] I don't really care
[4773.78 → 4774.22] all that much
[4774.22 → 4774.88] about watches
[4774.88 → 4776.80] but at that moment,
[4776.94 → 4778.14] I was captivated
[4778.14 → 4779.46] by his excitement.
[4780.84 → 4781.32] Right?
[4781.38 → 4782.58] Because he loved it
[4782.58 → 4783.24] so much
[4783.24 → 4784.12] the way he talked
[4784.12 → 4784.58] about it
[4784.58 → 4785.40] and his need
[4785.40 → 4786.62] to just know more
[4786.62 → 4787.70] and to share
[4787.70 → 4788.46] that knowledge
[4788.46 → 4789.72] was just compelling.
[4789.72 → 4792.52] If you treasure
[4792.52 → 4793.12] something,
[4793.46 → 4794.72] you show it off.
[4796.72 → 4796.88] I have,
[4797.00 → 4798.00] my son Malachi,
[4798.14 → 4798.56] he's six,
[4798.96 → 4799.64] he has a remote
[4799.64 → 4800.78] control monster truck
[4800.78 → 4802.12] that he saved up
[4802.12 → 4803.00] all his money for.
[4803.08 → 4803.62] It cost him like
[4803.62 → 4804.54] 80 something dollars
[4804.54 → 4805.90] and he loves it
[4805.90 → 4806.86] and whenever people
[4806.86 → 4807.82] come over to our house,
[4808.18 → 4808.90] he gets it out
[4808.90 → 4809.48] of his room
[4809.48 → 4810.90] and he shows it to them
[4810.90 → 4811.80] and he invites them
[4811.80 → 4812.68] to play with it.
[4813.64 → 4814.00] Right?
[4814.04 → 4815.02] When you treasure something,
[4815.12 → 4815.58] you love it
[4815.58 → 4816.62] and you show it off.
[4816.92 → 4817.92] You invite other people
[4817.92 → 4818.26] to it
[4818.26 → 4819.46] and so here's the question.
[4820.34 → 4821.24] Why don't we all
[4821.24 → 4821.98] do that with church?
[4823.78 → 4824.58] Why don't we all
[4824.58 → 4825.22] do that with Jesus?
[4827.58 → 4828.52] Do it with soccer.
[4829.88 → 4830.54] Do it with your
[4830.54 → 4831.64] fantasy football team.
[4833.02 → 4833.94] Why not with Jesus?
[4836.02 → 4836.26] You know,
[4836.32 → 4837.96] I think in the CRC church,
[4838.08 → 4838.78] maybe it's not
[4838.78 → 4839.92] particular to us
[4839.92 → 4840.70] but in my experience
[4840.70 → 4841.92] it's particular to the CRC
[4841.92 → 4844.08] and so I hear people
[4844.08 → 4844.96] say things like,
[4845.54 → 4846.50] I want to invite people
[4846.50 → 4847.04] to church
[4847.04 → 4848.44] but I don't want
[4848.44 → 4848.88] to invite them
[4848.88 → 4849.58] to my church.
[4853.80 → 4854.98] I've got to tell you,
[4855.72 → 4856.54] that kind of language
[4856.54 → 4859.20] breaks my heart.
[4862.98 → 4864.10] Why are you here?
[4866.16 → 4867.68] Why did you start here?
[4868.58 → 4870.18] Why do you stay here?
[4871.80 → 4872.00] Right?
[4872.02 → 4872.96] Tell that story.
[4874.58 → 4874.98] Right?
[4874.98 → 4876.18] You keep coming back
[4876.18 → 4876.96] and sure,
[4877.04 → 4877.64] maybe it's not all
[4877.64 → 4878.52] perfect and rosy
[4878.52 → 4879.76] but it's enough for you
[4879.76 → 4880.58] so maybe
[4880.58 → 4881.56] it'll be enough
[4881.56 → 4882.66] for your friend
[4882.66 → 4883.48] or for your neighbour
[4883.48 → 4884.62] because guess who's
[4884.62 → 4885.48] doing the work here?
[4885.76 → 4886.54] It's not you.
[4886.68 → 4887.34] It's God.
[4887.50 → 4888.36] It's the Spirit
[4888.36 → 4889.14] at work.
[4890.10 → 4890.32] And so,
[4890.38 → 4891.68] stop being your own
[4891.68 → 4892.60] stumbling block
[4892.60 → 4893.70] and let God work
[4893.70 → 4894.22] through you.
[4894.56 → 4895.74] Tell that story,
[4895.98 → 4896.16] right,
[4896.20 → 4897.48] of your faith journey
[4897.48 → 4897.96] and you don't need
[4897.96 → 4898.60] to have all the answers
[4898.60 → 4899.24] because no one
[4899.24 → 4900.48] has all the answers.
[4901.10 → 4901.94] God will use
[4901.94 → 4903.22] that story
[4903.22 → 4904.24] and it's here
[4904.24 → 4905.28] in the go
[4905.28 → 4906.44] that we must be
[4906.44 → 4907.18] better,
[4907.40 → 4907.52] right?
[4907.54 → 4908.40] We must remember
[4908.40 → 4909.80] our first love
[4909.80 → 4910.60] for Jesus
[4910.60 → 4912.40] and we must love
[4912.40 → 4913.80] what He loves,
[4914.36 → 4914.98] His church.
[4916.14 → 4917.10] And like Him,
[4917.26 → 4917.40] then,
[4917.48 → 4918.12] we must go
[4918.12 → 4918.64] and seek
[4918.64 → 4920.42] and save the lost.
[4920.84 → 4922.22] Whether it's here
[4922.22 → 4923.46] in your homes,
[4923.78 → 4923.98] right,
[4924.02 → 4924.52] as parents,
[4924.64 → 4925.64] your first mission field
[4925.64 → 4926.48] is to your kids.
[4926.94 → 4928.10] Whether it's in your neighbourhoods,
[4928.10 → 4929.48] your workplaces
[4929.48 → 4930.72] or your third places
[4930.72 → 4931.62] and third places
[4931.62 → 4932.28] is a word
[4932.28 → 4932.98] for those places
[4932.98 → 4934.78] that you frequent regularly
[4934.78 → 4935.26] where you have
[4935.26 → 4936.36] sort of sub-communities
[4936.36 → 4937.20] whether it's karate
[4937.20 → 4938.12] or soccer
[4938.12 → 4939.38] or Porter's Coffee House
[4939.38 → 4940.22] up the road.
[4940.42 → 4941.70] That is your mission field.
[4944.10 → 4944.66] And,
[4945.32 → 4946.54] make no mistake,
[4947.68 → 4948.52] some of you
[4948.52 → 4949.88] may be,
[4950.00 → 4951.08] some of you will be
[4951.08 → 4951.76] called
[4951.76 → 4953.12] to global mission.
[4954.22 → 4955.66] Some of you will be called
[4955.66 → 4957.02] to go around the world
[4957.02 → 4958.14] with the gospel
[4958.14 → 4958.62] to help
[4958.62 → 4959.90] in community
[4959.90 → 4961.06] or to bring Jesus
[4961.06 → 4961.62] to a place
[4961.62 → 4962.38] that He has never
[4962.38 → 4963.98] yet been brought.
[4965.04 → 4966.52] According to the Joshua Project,
[4967.42 → 4968.34] there are over
[4968.34 → 4970.52] 7,400
[4970.52 → 4972.20] unreached people groups
[4972.20 → 4973.64] still left in the world
[4973.64 → 4974.18] that make up
[4974.18 → 4975.40] over 41%
[4975.40 → 4976.80] of the world's population.
[4977.16 → 4977.28] Now,
[4977.36 → 4977.82] unreached
[4977.82 → 4978.66] is defined as
[4978.66 → 4979.78] people with like
[4979.78 → 4981.80] 0.2 or less
[4981.80 → 4982.56] Christian
[4982.56 → 4984.40] opportunities
[4984.40 → 4985.08] for encounter
[4985.08 → 4986.00] in their communities.
[4986.00 → 4987.32] The vast majority
[4987.32 → 4987.98] of these people,
[4988.12 → 4989.02] 85%
[4989.02 → 4989.80] of these
[4989.80 → 4991.18] unreached people groups
[4991.18 → 4992.46] exist in what's called
[4992.46 → 4994.60] the 1040 window
[4994.60 → 4996.00] and less than
[4996.00 → 4996.98] 10%
[4996.98 → 4997.60] of current
[4997.60 → 4998.28] missionary work
[4998.28 → 4998.78] is done
[4998.78 → 5000.02] to those people groups.
[5001.04 → 5002.16] God may call you there.
[5004.42 → 5004.92] In fact,
[5004.96 → 5005.54] I pray He does.
[5006.98 → 5007.84] And I pray that we
[5007.84 → 5008.86] can support
[5008.86 → 5009.64] those whom
[5009.64 → 5010.02] God
[5010.02 → 5010.82] calls.
[5012.98 → 5014.14] Let me land this plane.
[5014.14 → 5016.06] in conclusion.
[5017.78 → 5018.34] Overall,
[5018.84 → 5019.40] the state
[5019.40 → 5020.46] of our mission
[5020.46 → 5021.36] is
[5021.36 → 5022.32] strong.
[5023.38 → 5024.60] But more importantly,
[5025.60 → 5026.42] the state
[5026.42 → 5027.00] of our mission
[5027.00 → 5028.02] is clear.
[5029.02 → 5029.70] We know
[5029.70 → 5030.44] who we are
[5030.44 → 5032.46] and we can be
[5032.46 → 5033.46] and become
[5033.46 → 5034.24] more
[5034.24 → 5034.88] of who God
[5034.88 → 5035.74] is calling us.
[5035.74 → 5037.86] We know
[5037.86 → 5038.94] what we must do
[5038.94 → 5039.84] and we can
[5039.84 → 5040.90] trust God
[5040.90 → 5041.72] to lead us
[5041.72 → 5042.52] and to complete
[5042.52 → 5043.02] the work
[5043.02 → 5043.90] that He began
[5043.90 → 5044.78] in you.
[5045.78 → 5046.86] And we know
[5046.86 → 5047.44] where we
[5047.44 → 5048.86] must go.
[5049.72 → 5050.48] And now,
[5051.06 → 5052.36] we must step.
[5053.84 → 5054.24] Gather,
[5054.98 → 5055.40] grow,
[5056.28 → 5056.62] go.
[5057.62 → 5057.92] Amen.
[5058.92 → 5059.60] Let's pray.
[5059.60 → 5066.00] Lord our God,
[5066.24 → 5067.96] send us
[5067.96 → 5068.92] out
[5068.92 → 5069.92] now.
[5072.60 → 5073.72] We have gathered.
[5074.52 → 5075.66] Help us to gather.
[5077.50 → 5078.84] We have been grown.
[5079.12 → 5080.34] Help us to continue
[5080.34 → 5081.90] in our growth.
[5083.00 → 5083.78] And now,
[5083.88 → 5084.26] Lord God,
[5084.32 → 5084.70] we go.
[5086.18 → 5086.90] Send us out
[5086.90 → 5087.46] in the power
[5087.46 → 5088.08] of your name.
[5088.08 → 5088.74] Send us out
[5088.74 → 5089.22] on the firm
[5089.22 → 5089.70] foundation
[5089.70 → 5091.30] of your word.
[5091.48 → 5092.40] Send us out
[5092.40 → 5093.70] with the good news
[5093.70 → 5094.40] of the gospel
[5094.40 → 5095.78] to seek and save
[5095.78 → 5096.28] the lost
[5096.28 → 5097.48] and to transform
[5097.48 → 5098.80] communities
[5098.80 → 5099.60] by revealing
[5099.60 → 5100.82] your kingdom come
[5100.82 → 5102.18] and your kingdom
[5102.18 → 5103.04] coming.
[5104.52 → 5106.10] This is who we are.
[5107.66 → 5108.50] Help it also
[5108.50 → 5110.00] to be who we will become.
[5110.80 → 5111.74] Jesus Christ,
[5111.88 → 5112.26] we pray.
[5113.10 → 5113.42] Amen.
[5118.08 → 5121.00] Amen.
[5121.00 → 5122.60] Do not
[5122.60 → 5123.00] hope for our
[5123.00 → 5123.56] Lord,
[5123.56 → 5124.60] love you
[5124.60 → 5126.92] will come
[5126.92 → 5128.72] again.
[5129.00 → 5129.62] Amen.
[5129.62 → 5130.10] Amen.
[5132.50 → 5132.80] Amen.
[5132.80 → 5133.12] Amen.
[5133.20 → 5133.46] Amen.
[5133.46 → 5134.08] Amen.
[5134.08 → 5134.10] Amen.
[5134.20 → 5134.46] Amen.
[5135.12 → 5135.62] Amen.
[5135.70 → 5136.26] Amen.
[5136.26 → 5138.20] Amen.
[5138.20 → 5140.20] Amen.
[5141.10 → 5141.46] Amen.
[5141.46 → 5141.96] Amen.
[5141.96 → 5142.16] Amen.
[5142.16 → 5142.36] Amen.
[5142.44 → 5142.68] Amen.
[5142.68 → 5142.92] Amen.
[5143.48 → 5143.84] Amen.
[5143.84 → 5144.98] Amen.
[5144.98 → 5147.98] Amen.
[5147.98 → 5151.20] Lord, I'll reign in me again
[5151.20 → 5155.22] Lord, I'll reign in me again
[5155.22 → 5157.76] Lord, reign in me
[5157.76 → 5160.18] Bleeding in your power
[5160.18 → 5162.86] Over all my dreams
[5162.86 → 5165.16] In my darkest hour
[5165.16 → 5167.72] You are the Lord
[5167.72 → 5171.06] Of all my days
[5171.06 → 5174.72] So won't you reign in me again
[5174.72 → 5186.70] For every heart
[5186.70 → 5188.92] Of every word
[5188.92 → 5191.24] In my life, grace, grace
[5191.24 → 5193.66] The beauty of my Lord
[5193.66 → 5195.98] Consuming more to me
[5195.98 → 5198.90] Than any earthly thing
[5198.90 → 5203.14] So won't you reign in me again
[5203.14 → 5205.60] Lord, reign in me
[5205.60 → 5208.14] Reign in your power
[5208.14 → 5210.64] Over all my dreams
[5210.64 → 5212.98] In my darkest hour
[5212.98 → 5215.44] You are the Lord
[5215.44 → 5218.76] Of all I have
[5218.76 → 5222.38] So won't you reign in me again
[5222.38 → 5224.98] Lord, reign in me
[5224.98 → 5227.38] Reign in your power
[5227.38 → 5229.80] Over all my dreams
[5229.80 → 5232.10] In my darkest night
[5232.10 → 5234.56] You are the Lord
[5234.56 → 5237.80] Of all I am
[5237.80 → 5241.38] So won't you reign in me again
[5241.38 → 5246.26] So won't you reign in me again
[5246.26 → 5269.80] Our mission is clear
[5269.80 → 5274.36] But where God is sending us
[5274.36 → 5276.26] We may not yet know
[5276.26 → 5278.76] But we go together
[5278.76 → 5280.86] And we go with God
[5280.86 → 5285.48] That is an unstoppable force
[5285.48 → 5287.32] For good in the world
[5287.32 → 5289.92] So receive the blessing
[5289.92 → 5292.18] Of our God as we go
[5292.18 → 5296.14] God goes before you
[5296.14 → 5297.26] To lead you
[5297.26 → 5299.72] God goes behind you
[5299.72 → 5300.88] To protect you
[5300.88 → 5303.56] God goes beneath you
[5303.56 → 5304.52] To support you
[5304.52 → 5306.88] And God goes beside you
[5306.88 → 5308.06] To befriend you
[5308.06 → 5311.46] And so do not be afraid
[5311.46 → 5313.58] Let the blessing of God
[5313.58 → 5314.54] Come upon you today
[5314.54 → 5316.52] Do not be afraid
[5316.52 → 5319.30] Go in peace
[5319.30 → 5322.18] To love and serve the Lord
[5322.18 → 5324.38] Amen
[5327.26 → 5332.00] God goes beyond you
[5332.00 → 5332.46] Don't be afraid
[5332.46 → 5333.46] Let you hang out
[5333.54 → 5334.76] You stand there
[5334.76 → 5335.30] You may need you
[5335.30 → 5335.90] To blessing you
[5335.90 → 5336.28] To inspiration you
[5336.28 → 5337.00] Let you trust
[5337.00 → 5337.30] Even the Lord
[5337.30 → 5337.92] God goes beyond you
[5337.92 → 5338.58] 發��
[5338.58 → 5340.10] fucking
[5340.10 → 5341.86] In Jesus
[5341.86 → 5341.90] Who live you
[5341.90 → 5342.44] Do not be precedence
[5342.44 → 5342.70] By a judgment
[5342.70 → 5343.12] How that does
[5343.12 → 5343.56] Oh
[5343.56 → 5344.06] Oh
[5344.06 → 5344.66] And so do not
[5344.66 → 5344.92] Give me

[5489.16 → 5506.16] Look what you've done
[5506.16 → 5510.64] How could you fall so far?
[5511.32 → 5513.60] You should be ashamed of yourself
[5513.60 → 5516.74] So I was ashamed of myself
[5516.74 → 5519.14] The lies I believed
[5519.14 → 5523.16] They got some roots, they run deep
[5523.16 → 5526.24] I let them take a hold of my life
[5526.24 → 5529.54] I let them take control of my life
[5529.54 → 5532.42] Standing in your presence, Lord
[5532.42 → 5534.90] I can feel you digging all the roots up
[5534.90 → 5538.04] I feel you healing all my wounds up
[5538.04 → 5540.80] All I can say is hallelujah

[5543.74 → 5547.70] Look what you've done in me
[5547.70 → 5551.72] You spoke your truth into the lies
[5551.72 → 5553.82] I let my heart believe
[5553.82 → 5556.14] Look at me now
[5556.14 → 5560.32] Look how you made me new
[5560.32 → 5566.36] The enemy did everything that he could do
[5566.36 → 5568.98] Oh, but look what you've done
[5568.98 → 5573.56] Suddenly all the shame is gone
[5573.56 → 5576.52] I thought I was too broke, and now I see
[5576.52 → 5580.06] You were breaking new ground inside of me
[5580.06 → 5582.64] Standing in your presence, Lord
[5582.64 → 5585.08] I can feel you digging all my roots up
[5585.08 → 5588.32] I feel you healing all my wounds up

[5617.88 → 5619.88] Look what you've done
[5619.88 → 5621.88] On the cross, in a grave
[5621.88 → 5624.88] With a stone, thrown away
[5624.88 → 5627.88] All my debt, it was pain
[5627.88 → 5630.88] Look what you've done
[5630.88 → 5633.88] In my heart, in my mind
[5633.88 → 5636.88] In my soul, in my life
[5636.88 → 5640.88] With my hands lifted high, I'm singing
[5640.88 → 5642.88] Look what you've done
[5642.88 → 5644.88] Look what you've done
[5644.88 → 5647.88] Look what you've done in me

[5660.88 → 5665.88] Oh, the enemy did everything that he could do
[5665.88 → 5668.88] Oh, but look what you've done
[5668.88 → 5674.30] On a cross, in a grave, with a stone
[5674.30 → 5679.06] All my way, all my dead, it was pain
[5679.06 → 5681.96] Look what you've done
[5681.96 → 5688.20] In my heart, in my mind, in my soul, in my life
[5688.20 → 5692.06] With my hands lifted high, I'm singing
[5692.06 → 5694.38] Look what you've done
[5698.88 → 5728.86] In my heart, in my heart, I'm singing
[5728.88 → 5731.00] I've been a sinner, been a saint
[5731.00 → 5737.22] I've been right, I've been so, so wrong
[5737.22 → 5740.12] Yeah, I made my mistakes
[5740.12 → 5742.88] I don't know what it's like to be you
[5742.88 → 5747.88] You don't know what it's like to be me
[5747.88 → 5752.54] What if we're all the same
[5752.54 → 5754.82] In different kinds of ways
[5754.82 → 5757.02] Can you, can you relate?
[5758.88 → 5762.26] We both know what it's like to be hurt
[5762.26 → 5767.22] We both know what it's like to feel pain
[5767.22 → 5771.58] But I think it's safe to say
[5771.58 → 5774.06] We're on to better days
[5774.06 → 5776.22] Can you, can you relate?
[5777.12 → 5778.36] Can you relate?
[5778.36 → 5783.58] Have you ever been left when you should have been loved?
[5785.44 → 5788.36] Has there ever been a time when you stayed, but you should have run?
[5788.36 → 5790.98] Because I've been real, I've been fake
[5790.98 → 5795.78] Been a sinner, been a saint
[5795.78 → 5806.30] Attention please everyone, attention please
[5806.30 → 5807.86] A phone was found
[5807.86 → 5809.86] Someone has lost their phone
[5809.86 → 5811.30] I have possession of it
[5811.30 → 5813.02] You need to prove that it's yours
[5813.02 → 5815.38] But come and see me if you're missing your phone
[5815.38 → 5816.00] Thank you
[5816.00 → 5817.38] You need to be honest
[5817.38 → 5818.38] I have to be honest
[5818.38 → 5819.38] I have to be honest
[5819.38 → 5825.38] We both know what it's like to be hurt
[5825.38 → 5829.38] We both know what it's like to feel pain
[5829.38 → 5832.34] But I think it's safe to say
[5832.34 → 5838.84] We're on to better days
[5838.84 → 5841.14] Can you, can you relate?
[5841.64 → 5843.34] Can you relate?
