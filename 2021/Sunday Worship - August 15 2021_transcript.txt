[2759.46 --> 2789.46]  Thank you.
[2789.46 --> 2790.46]  Thank you.
[2819.46 --> 2820.46]  I'll answer you.
[2849.46 --> 2850.46]  Okay.
[2879.46 --> 2909.46]  Thank you.
[2909.46 --> 2910.46]  Thank you.
[2939.46 --> 2969.46]  Thank you.
[2969.46 --> 2999.46]  Thank you.
[2999.46 --> 3029.46] 
[3029.46 --> 3059.46]  Thank you.
[3059.46 --> 3089.46] 
[3089.46 --> 3090.46]  Thank you.
[3090.46 --> 3091.46]  Thank you.
[3091.46 --> 3092.46]  Okay.
[3092.46 --> 3093.46]  Okay.
[3093.46 --> 3094.46]  Okay.
[3094.46 --> 3095.46]  esse chiff astonhave 62, E size.
[3095.46 --> 3105.50]  were both naked, and they felt no shame. Okay. The first question was, are there two separate
[3105.50 --> 3112.42]  creation accounts? In Genesis, the first story being Genesis 1 to 2 verse 3, and Genesis 2 verses
[3112.42 --> 3120.52]  4 to 25. The answer to this question is simply yes. But for future convenience, I'm going to
[3120.52 --> 3123.50]  refer to the first story as the first story, and the second story as the second story, because
[3123.50 --> 3130.64]  saying that whole thing is a lot for convenience. So, okay. When we read the stories, though, there
[3130.64 --> 3135.88]  are ways you can tell they're different and written for different purposes. There are four things. For
[3135.88 --> 3142.06]  the first example, the first story only describes God with the name God, Elohim, meaning God in English.
[3142.48 --> 3148.42]  This is a title. It's not a name. That's because the first story is not personal. The first story is
[3148.42 --> 3155.46]  about God making the earth. The second story uses his personal name, Yahweh Elohim, meaning the Lord
[3155.46 --> 3160.44]  God. This is the same name God gives to Moses at the burning bush as his covenant name.
[3162.46 --> 3166.50]  Second thing is, in the first story, God is described as creating the whole habitable world
[3166.50 --> 3171.42]  out of nothing. It is all structured and was described as a seven-day week. He creates for
[3171.42 --> 3177.38]  six, rests on the seventh, and each day starts with, and God said, and ends with the day of the week.
[3179.46 --> 3184.46]  The third thing is that the first story is theocentric, meaning it's God-centered. God
[3184.46 --> 3190.20]  existed before all. God created all. Humanity is made in God's image. God rests. It's about God's
[3190.20 --> 3196.86]  power, God's plan, and God's purpose. The second story is anthropocentric. Though it has all those
[3196.86 --> 3204.00]  things that the first story has, it's more focused on humanity, what Adam and Eve do, who they are.
[3204.34 --> 3208.46]  In the second story, they have names, whereas in the first story, they're just man and woman.
[3210.38 --> 3215.00]  The last thing is that in Genesis chapter 1, it's a whole picture without much detail,
[3215.76 --> 3220.82]  and in Genesis 2, it's very detailed about one specific creation that God has a relationship with.
[3220.82 --> 3227.16]  Now, though those differences are important, I think the writer of this question was thinking
[3227.16 --> 3233.74]  about some other differences, specifically where the two stories don't line up. They seemingly don't
[3233.74 --> 3240.32]  agree on some of the details. There are two ways that they don't agree. First is that in Genesis 1,
[3240.50 --> 3247.42]  God makes all the plant life on day three, and all the humans on day six, and it specifies that the
[3247.42 --> 3252.56]  plants were spoken into being. They came out of the ground. God confirms it with his blessing,
[3253.26 --> 3260.74]  and then the third day ends, and then God makes man on day six. But in Genesis 2, God makes Adam,
[3260.86 --> 3268.54]  and it specifies that the plants had not sprung up yet. Only after making Adam does God specify making
[3268.54 --> 3277.40]  the plants in chapter 2. This is a problem because the order's wrong. The second problem is that in
[3277.40 --> 3283.32]  Genesis 1, God makes both man and woman on day six, as well as all the animals. In Genesis 2,
[3283.44 --> 3290.16]  God makes Adam, then puts him in the garden, then gets him to name every creature, and then when none
[3290.16 --> 3300.08]  of them are seen as a helper, God makes Eve. Now, why is this a problem? Well, as of now, there are 1.2
[3300.08 --> 3306.58]  million species on planet Earth, with seven million more yet to be discovered. And Adam is stated to
[3306.58 --> 3313.30]  have named every living creature. Now, in chapter 2, verse 19, it specifies birds of the sky and beasts
[3313.30 --> 3321.04]  of the field, but even if you do the reduction, it's 16,000 species and more still yet to be discovered.
[3322.32 --> 3328.00]  Now, for a man who didn't exist five minutes ago, who just learned how to talk and is experiencing the
[3328.00 --> 3335.18]  whole world for the first time, even for us, that's quite the feat in 24 hours.
[3336.76 --> 3340.82]  Now, if this idea of Genesis 1 and 2 being two stories makes you feel uncomfortable,
[3341.56 --> 3348.30]  that's okay. If it raises questions in you, that's good. That's what this sermon series is about.
[3349.38 --> 3352.16]  The church is here as a place where you can grow in your understanding of the Word,
[3352.16 --> 3358.86]  ask questions, continue to discuss these questions in good faith and love. That's discipleship.
[3360.04 --> 3365.64]  We have to acknowledge what Scripture is, what the story's purpose is, and what its purpose isn't.
[3366.40 --> 3371.80]  Genesis 1 and 2 were written in a very specific time period to a very specific culture,
[3372.34 --> 3377.26]  and it's different from us today. We don't write in the styles that they write.
[3377.26 --> 3381.98]  And since we were not the ones Genesis was written to, though it was written for us,
[3382.44 --> 3387.46]  we have to learn the way it was written. We have to learn about the people it was written to and
[3387.46 --> 3393.98]  their history and the place that they would be in to receive such a story. As we know, these people
[3393.98 --> 3400.00]  that received the story are the Israelites. They received this story 3,000 years ago. The Israelites
[3400.00 --> 3404.76]  were all descended from the well-known man Abraham. Abraham had a son named Isaac, who had a son named Jacob,
[3404.76 --> 3413.02]  who had 12 sons, and then who lived in Egypt for 400 years as slaves. Abraham was from a city called Ur,
[3413.98 --> 3419.40]  which in this time would have been part of the old Sumerian Empire. In Sumer, the religious capital
[3419.40 --> 3423.90]  was the famed city Babylon. This is the same city that would be led by Nebuchadnezzar, who would destroy
[3423.90 --> 3432.94]  Israel and bring them into exile. This was Abraham's world. He was bathed in the Babylonian creation
[3432.94 --> 3439.02]  stories. Abraham and Sarah and all his servants were raised with it. That story is called the Enuma
[3439.02 --> 3445.18]  Elish, the one mentioned in the question. The Israelites themselves, after being slaves for 400
[3445.18 --> 3449.70]  years, would start to get to know the stories of their captors. The Israelites would have known the
[3449.70 --> 3455.44]  Egyptian creation stories well, but that's just not it. Moses, the one who wrote the first five books
[3455.44 --> 3460.88]  of the Bible, the one that God got to lead the Israelites and free them from Egypt, he was raised as an
[3460.88 --> 3465.76]  Egyptian royal family member. He would have learned their culture, their philosophy, and their religion
[3465.76 --> 3471.64]  and known it very well for most of his life. This is the setting where Israel receives the biblical creation
[3471.64 --> 3478.00]  story. Right after they're freed from slavery, they experience the tent plagues, the pillar of fire, and the
[3478.00 --> 3484.40]  splitting of the Red Sea. This is where they receive it. The Israelites are cultural descendants of Babylon
[3484.40 --> 3491.12]  Babylon and Egypt. So when we find similarities in their creation stories, we shouldn't find this
[3491.12 --> 3498.60]  surprising. And this is because Genesis, among the many things that it is, it is written as a polemic.
[3499.60 --> 3506.56]  A polemic is a writing style used to undermine or attack religious or political beliefs. Genesis 1 and 2
[3506.56 --> 3510.82]  are a direct attack on the beliefs and understandings that have been drilled into the Israelite head
[3510.82 --> 3517.60]  for 400 years. God is trying to unlearn the Israelites all the horrible things that they've learned and
[3517.60 --> 3523.24]  replace them, replace all the wrong and false ideas the culture has embedded in them and give them his
[3523.24 --> 3529.74]  word instead. Part of the way a polemic does this is by using the language of the thing it's attacking.
[3531.10 --> 3540.18]  So here we dive deep into some history stuff, so get ready. For example, Genesis 1 is very Egyptian in style.
[3540.82 --> 3545.24]  It is strikingly similar to the creation story known as the Ogdod, which reads like this.
[3547.74 --> 3553.12]  The cosmos was undifferentiated formlessness. Darkness was on the surface of the primordial watery deep.
[3553.78 --> 3556.16]  The divine wind of a tomb was over the primeval waters.
[3557.94 --> 3563.30]  Now, way less poetic than the biblical story, but you can notice the similarities.
[3564.68 --> 3568.58]  Well, it doesn't stop there. Another one of the Egyptian creation stories known as the Memphis story
[3568.58 --> 3571.36]  follows the same order of creation as Genesis 1.
[3572.50 --> 3574.24]  There is an in-the-beginning phrase,
[3575.00 --> 3576.96]  then a lifeless, chaotic, watery ocean.
[3577.80 --> 3579.64]  A tomb, the divine wind, is over the deep.
[3580.46 --> 3582.16]  Pata speaks and light appears.
[3583.10 --> 3585.06]  Waters are separated and the sky is created.
[3585.56 --> 3587.84]  The dry ground appears, being separated from the waters.
[3588.56 --> 3591.24]  The sun is made, this time in the image of Ra,
[3591.44 --> 3592.36]  and set to rule the day.
[3592.36 --> 3596.22]  The earth sprouts vegetation, animals, fish, birds, and reptiles.
[3596.94 --> 3599.02]  The idols are made in the image of the gods,
[3599.40 --> 3601.30]  and Pata rests in satisfaction of his creation.
[3604.90 --> 3605.72]  Uncanny, isn't it?
[3606.74 --> 3609.70]  Now, jumping to Genesis 2, which is much more Babylonian in style.
[3610.20 --> 3612.42]  I know, we're getting really in the weeds right here,
[3612.68 --> 3614.02]  but it's necessary.
[3614.84 --> 3617.48]  So, the Babylonian story goes like this.
[3617.82 --> 3619.88]  The Enumalish, the one I told you you would know about.
[3619.88 --> 3622.42]  When the heavens above did not exist,
[3622.48 --> 3623.98]  and the earth beneath had not come into being,
[3624.50 --> 3627.08]  there was Apsu, the first in order, their begetter,
[3627.30 --> 3629.12]  and Demiurge Tiamat, who gave birth to them all.
[3629.46 --> 3630.80]  They had mingled their waters together
[3630.80 --> 3632.32]  before Meadowland had coalesced,
[3632.34 --> 3634.48]  and Reedbed was yet to be found.
[3635.20 --> 3636.96]  When not one of the gods had been formed
[3636.96 --> 3637.84]  or had come into being,
[3638.26 --> 3639.68]  when no destinies had been decreed,
[3639.80 --> 3641.10]  the gods were created within them.
[3641.40 --> 3644.58]  Lahamu and Lahamu were formed and came into being.
[3645.24 --> 3647.96]  This sounds very similar to Genesis 2, 5-7.
[3647.96 --> 3651.58]  When no bush of the field was yet in the land,
[3651.62 --> 3653.64]  and no small plant of the field had yet sprung up.
[3654.46 --> 3656.38]  The Lord God had not caused it to rain on the land,
[3656.80 --> 3658.24]  and there was no man to work the ground.
[3658.52 --> 3659.94]  And a mist was going up from the land
[3659.94 --> 3662.24]  that was watering the whole face of the ground.
[3662.68 --> 3664.00]  Then the Lord God formed the man
[3664.00 --> 3664.84]  from the dust of the ground
[3664.84 --> 3666.54]  and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.
[3667.46 --> 3668.56]  The man became a living creature.
[3670.08 --> 3672.58]  Now, if you're like me, you're a history nut,
[3673.22 --> 3675.94]  then you would love the similarities in this.
[3675.94 --> 3677.32]  They're very cool.
[3677.80 --> 3679.44]  But this is a polemic,
[3679.54 --> 3681.02]  so it's in the differences that matter.
[3682.20 --> 3683.26]  It's in the differences that we see
[3683.26 --> 3685.10]  what Genesis is teaching us about God
[3685.10 --> 3686.82]  and mankind and the creation
[3686.82 --> 3688.02]  and our relationship with God,
[3688.74 --> 3690.44]  our relationship with each other and the world.
[3691.28 --> 3693.56]  So if you checked out before the history section,
[3693.80 --> 3695.78]  because you get bored with this stuff,
[3696.00 --> 3697.06]  now's the time to jump back in
[3697.06 --> 3697.74]  because here's the lesson.
[3699.64 --> 3702.02]  There are six things that Genesis is teaching us
[3702.02 --> 3702.72]  as a polemic.
[3702.72 --> 3705.86]  The first is that God is wholly other,
[3706.58 --> 3708.12]  eternal, and the creator of all.
[3709.18 --> 3710.44]  In the Egyptian story,
[3711.52 --> 3713.30]  the God named a tomb creates himself
[3713.30 --> 3714.34]  from the primordial deep.
[3715.20 --> 3717.18]  But in Genesis, God doesn't have a beginning.
[3717.98 --> 3719.58]  The very first verse of the Bible
[3719.58 --> 3721.70]  assumes that God has always existed.
[3722.42 --> 3723.70]  In the beginning, God.
[3724.64 --> 3727.06]  Other parts of the scripture state the same.
[3727.32 --> 3728.34]  Revelation 1.8,
[3728.72 --> 3730.48]  who is, who was, and who is to come.
[3731.12 --> 3733.44]  Psalm 90, verse 2, from the beginning.
[3734.40 --> 3735.70]  From everlasting to everlasting,
[3735.90 --> 3736.60]  you are God.
[3737.28 --> 3738.46]  Colossians 1.17,
[3738.96 --> 3740.00]  he is before all things,
[3740.04 --> 3741.50]  and in him all things hold together.
[3742.42 --> 3743.84]  God is wholly other.
[3745.38 --> 3747.06]  The second thing is that God created
[3747.06 --> 3748.26]  everything that exists,
[3748.62 --> 3750.60]  has ever existed or will ever exist.
[3751.26 --> 3753.26]  Nothing that exists was not made by him.
[3754.48 --> 3756.80]  The Egyptian story has a tomb create the world,
[3756.80 --> 3759.26]  but the deep is there before him,
[3759.84 --> 3762.72]  and he makes himself from nothing.
[3762.98 --> 3764.14]  I don't know how you do that.
[3764.60 --> 3765.84]  I don't know who came up with that idea
[3765.84 --> 3766.54]  in their story,
[3766.68 --> 3768.70]  but in Genesis,
[3768.92 --> 3771.02]  God creates everything by simply saying,
[3771.30 --> 3771.86]  let there be.
[3772.86 --> 3773.58]  And it was so.
[3773.90 --> 3775.14]  No effort required.
[3776.14 --> 3776.96]  Hebrews 11.3,
[3777.04 --> 3778.32]  by faith we understand that the universe
[3778.32 --> 3779.60]  was created by the word of God,
[3780.16 --> 3781.98]  so that that, what is seen,
[3782.06 --> 3784.50]  was not made out of things that are visible.
[3784.50 --> 3786.60]  Psalm 33, verse 6,
[3786.74 --> 3787.48]  by the word of the Lord,
[3787.58 --> 3788.44]  the heavens were made,
[3789.10 --> 3789.96]  and by his mouth,
[3790.34 --> 3791.22]  by the breath of his mouth,
[3791.34 --> 3792.02]  all their hosts.
[3792.84 --> 3794.54]  God created everything.
[3796.86 --> 3798.90]  Third, when God created the world,
[3799.24 --> 3800.16]  he said it was good.
[3801.58 --> 3802.58]  When the Egyptian god,
[3802.64 --> 3803.54]  a tomb made the world,
[3804.36 --> 3806.04]  it was because he needed a place to stand on.
[3807.46 --> 3809.42]  When the Babylonian god made the animals,
[3810.12 --> 3811.16]  it was because they were hungry.
[3812.32 --> 3813.42]  A tomb made humans,
[3813.42 --> 3814.16]  by accident,
[3814.26 --> 3814.78]  when he cried,
[3814.88 --> 3816.68]  and his tears mingled in the dust of the earth.
[3817.46 --> 3819.34]  And Marduk made humans for slave labor,
[3819.44 --> 3820.78]  so that they didn't have to work anymore.
[3823.00 --> 3825.30]  The world of the Egyptians and the Babylonians
[3825.30 --> 3826.82]  is tragic, horrifying,
[3827.12 --> 3827.66]  purposeless,
[3828.02 --> 3828.80]  and evil.
[3829.74 --> 3831.32]  But when God makes the world,
[3832.14 --> 3833.36]  he makes it with purpose,
[3833.62 --> 3834.18]  with meaning,
[3834.44 --> 3834.96]  intention,
[3835.60 --> 3835.92]  beauty,
[3836.14 --> 3836.68]  and care.
[3837.22 --> 3838.90]  He makes man with his hands,
[3839.16 --> 3841.32]  and breathes his life into them intentionally.
[3841.32 --> 3842.82]  Gives them work,
[3842.92 --> 3845.10]  so that they can partake in what God's doing on the earth.
[3845.68 --> 3846.74]  He makes a garden,
[3846.94 --> 3848.98]  puts food in it for the people and the animals.
[3849.46 --> 3851.32]  He ends every day with the statement,
[3851.56 --> 3852.38]  and it was good,
[3852.74 --> 3854.12]  and blesses his creation,
[3854.28 --> 3854.92]  and enjoys it,
[3855.02 --> 3855.92]  and dwells in it.
[3856.84 --> 3857.98]  God said it was good.
[3859.86 --> 3860.80]  The fourth thing
[3860.80 --> 3862.90]  is that God created man in his image.
[3862.90 --> 3865.16]  As stated before,
[3865.28 --> 3867.40]  the Egyptian gods accidentally created humans,
[3867.90 --> 3869.38]  but the Babylonian gods,
[3869.52 --> 3870.60]  after defeating the evil,
[3870.70 --> 3871.06]  demonic,
[3871.22 --> 3871.52]  tyrant,
[3871.64 --> 3871.86]  villain,
[3872.02 --> 3872.40]  Kingu,
[3873.48 --> 3875.48]  Marduk makes the humans out of his corpse,
[3875.96 --> 3877.20]  so that they don't have to labor.
[3879.16 --> 3880.38]  Humans are an afterthought.
[3882.02 --> 3883.48]  But Yahweh Elohim
[3883.48 --> 3885.92]  is cutting deep at these stories,
[3886.04 --> 3888.08]  and he says something extremely different.
[3888.92 --> 3890.04]  Genesis 1, 27,
[3890.04 --> 3892.18]  God created men in his image.
[3892.74 --> 3893.30]  In the image of God,
[3893.36 --> 3893.96]  he created him.
[3894.04 --> 3894.68]  Male and female,
[3894.82 --> 3895.64]  he created them.
[3896.32 --> 3897.28]  Genesis 2, 7,
[3897.82 --> 3899.86]  Then the Lord God formed the man of the dust
[3899.86 --> 3900.38]  from the ground
[3900.38 --> 3902.22]  and breathed into his nostrils
[3902.22 --> 3903.30]  the breath of life.
[3904.74 --> 3905.72]  The breath of life there
[3905.72 --> 3906.44]  is the same word
[3906.44 --> 3907.38]  as the spirit or the wind
[3907.38 --> 3908.22]  that's over the deep.
[3909.84 --> 3910.86]  Genesis 5, 1,
[3911.00 --> 3912.58]  This is the book of the generations of Adam.
[3913.02 --> 3913.54]  In this day,
[3913.62 --> 3914.64]  when God created man,
[3914.76 --> 3916.40]  he made them in the image of God.
[3917.28 --> 3918.22]  James 3, 9,
[3918.48 --> 3919.92]  With it we bless the Lord our Father
[3919.92 --> 3921.06]  and with it we curse men
[3921.06 --> 3922.06]  who have been made
[3922.06 --> 3923.40]  in the likeness of God.
[3924.00 --> 3925.68]  God made men in his image.
[3927.38 --> 3928.08]  The fifth thing
[3928.08 --> 3929.38]  is that God created us
[3929.38 --> 3930.66]  to have dominion over the earth.
[3931.76 --> 3933.04]  In the other creation stories,
[3933.18 --> 3933.84]  we humans are either
[3933.84 --> 3935.00]  not supposed to exist,
[3935.52 --> 3936.38]  or they made us
[3936.38 --> 3937.64]  just to cook the gods' food
[3937.64 --> 3938.78]  and to make them a cool house.
[3940.22 --> 3941.08]  But in Genesis,
[3941.74 --> 3943.42]  God gives us the cultural mandate
[3943.42 --> 3944.34]  that Chris talked about
[3944.34 --> 3945.10]  the other week.
[3946.04 --> 3946.80]  And God blessed them
[3946.80 --> 3947.60]  and God said to them,
[3947.72 --> 3948.64]  Be fruitful and multiply
[3948.64 --> 3949.62]  and fill the earth
[3949.62 --> 3950.16]  and subdue it
[3950.16 --> 3950.84]  and have dominion
[3950.84 --> 3952.10]  over the fish of the sea
[3952.10 --> 3953.10]  and over the birds of the heavens
[3953.10 --> 3954.16]  and over every living thing
[3954.16 --> 3954.98]  that moves on the ground.
[3956.06 --> 3957.04]  Genesis 2, 15,
[3957.16 --> 3958.10]  The Lord God took the man
[3958.10 --> 3958.88]  and put him in the garden
[3958.88 --> 3960.34]  to work it and keep it.
[3961.38 --> 3963.16]  God made us to enjoy his creation
[3963.16 --> 3964.82]  and to join with him
[3964.82 --> 3966.10]  in the work of maintaining it.
[3966.98 --> 3967.70]  God created us
[3967.70 --> 3968.88]  to have dominion over the earth.
[3970.38 --> 3970.74]  Lastly,
[3971.30 --> 3972.18]  and most depressingly,
[3972.80 --> 3973.62]  disobeying God
[3973.62 --> 3974.80]  leads to death.
[3976.04 --> 3977.04]  In the other stories,
[3977.16 --> 3977.96]  death was just a part
[3977.96 --> 3979.22]  of the design
[3979.22 --> 3980.46]  or the lack thereof.
[3981.42 --> 3982.06]  But in Genesis,
[3982.34 --> 3983.40]  God states that death
[3983.40 --> 3984.98]  is a result of disobeying him.
[3985.94 --> 3986.38]  You shall eat
[3986.38 --> 3987.26]  of every tree of the garden,
[3987.78 --> 3988.40]  but if the tree
[3988.40 --> 3988.84]  of the knowledge
[3988.84 --> 3989.46]  of good and evil,
[3989.68 --> 3990.42]  you shall not eat,
[3990.50 --> 3991.06]  for on that day
[3991.06 --> 3991.70]  you shall die.
[3993.28 --> 3994.06]  Everything wrong
[3994.06 --> 3994.58]  with this world
[3994.58 --> 3995.26]  is our fault,
[3995.64 --> 3996.36]  not God's.
[3997.66 --> 3998.26]  Disobeying God
[3998.26 --> 3998.94]  leads to death.
[4000.48 --> 4001.36]  Now, don't get me wrong
[4001.36 --> 4002.62]  in all that I've said today.
[4003.58 --> 4004.94]  These stories are not equal.
[4005.84 --> 4006.46]  God isn't just,
[4006.66 --> 4007.94]  Genesis isn't just
[4007.94 --> 4008.82]  another creation story
[4008.82 --> 4009.90]  amongst creation stories.
[4010.28 --> 4011.04]  On the contrary,
[4011.50 --> 4012.86]  it's God's creation story.
[4013.62 --> 4014.28]  As a polemic,
[4014.42 --> 4015.66]  Genesis is teaching us
[4015.66 --> 4016.70]  and the Israelites
[4016.70 --> 4017.76]  about God,
[4018.16 --> 4018.58]  ourselves,
[4018.74 --> 4019.44]  and our relationship
[4019.44 --> 4019.90]  with him.
[4020.92 --> 4021.80]  But it was written
[4021.80 --> 4022.50]  to the Israelites
[4022.50 --> 4023.52]  using the writing styles
[4023.52 --> 4024.38]  of their time.
[4025.56 --> 4026.50]  God is using the polemic
[4026.50 --> 4027.32]  because the differences
[4027.32 --> 4028.12]  show how different
[4028.12 --> 4029.60]  he is from the other gods.
[4029.60 --> 4031.38]  Not just different,
[4031.52 --> 4032.20]  but how much greater
[4032.20 --> 4032.76]  he is.
[4033.42 --> 4033.80]  After all,
[4033.90 --> 4035.16]  he's the one true God,
[4035.42 --> 4036.46]  the Most High God,
[4036.54 --> 4037.48]  the Almighty God,
[4037.86 --> 4038.48]  the name above
[4038.48 --> 4039.46]  all other names,
[4039.58 --> 4040.28]  the Lord of Lords,
[4040.44 --> 4041.12]  the King of Kings,
[4041.26 --> 4042.12]  the God of Gods.
[4042.68 --> 4043.68]  There is no God like him.
[4043.74 --> 4044.60]  He has no equal.
[4045.12 --> 4046.20]  He has always existed
[4046.20 --> 4047.32]  and always will exist.
[4047.96 --> 4048.80]  He is omnipotent,
[4048.90 --> 4049.30]  omniscient,
[4049.42 --> 4049.92]  omnipresent.
[4050.46 --> 4051.12]  He is the creator
[4051.12 --> 4052.58]  and redeemer of creation.
[4053.22 --> 4053.98]  He is Yahweh,
[4054.34 --> 4054.76]  Elohim.
[4056.76 --> 4057.62]  Genesis 1 and 2
[4057.62 --> 4058.68]  are two creation stories
[4058.68 --> 4059.66]  that work together
[4059.66 --> 4061.46]  to counter the lies
[4061.46 --> 4062.12]  that the Israelites
[4062.12 --> 4063.50]  and us were ever told
[4063.50 --> 4064.04]  about God.
[4065.36 --> 4066.34]  The first story
[4066.34 --> 4067.00]  is a beautiful,
[4067.26 --> 4068.10]  orderly, poetic,
[4068.62 --> 4069.70]  a story about a God
[4069.70 --> 4071.56]  so incomprehensibly great
[4071.56 --> 4073.90]  that he can create
[4073.90 --> 4074.54]  the world
[4074.54 --> 4076.94]  by merely saying words.
[4078.44 --> 4078.92]  Yet,
[4079.02 --> 4079.52]  when he makes
[4079.52 --> 4080.46]  his final creation,
[4080.62 --> 4081.10]  men and women,
[4081.56 --> 4082.16]  he makes them
[4082.16 --> 4083.08]  with his hands
[4083.08 --> 4084.46]  and designs them
[4084.46 --> 4085.40]  after himself.
[4087.22 --> 4088.22]  The second story
[4088.22 --> 4089.18]  is about Adam and Eve
[4089.18 --> 4090.44]  who live in a paradise
[4090.44 --> 4091.88]  and are in a perfect relationship
[4091.88 --> 4092.60]  with their loving God
[4092.60 --> 4093.22]  and with each other.
[4093.74 --> 4094.80]  They were made for him
[4094.80 --> 4095.92]  and for each other.
[4097.08 --> 4097.78]  We learn that humans
[4097.78 --> 4098.60]  were made to take care
[4098.60 --> 4098.96]  of the earth
[4098.96 --> 4100.66]  and given the responsibility
[4100.66 --> 4102.24]  to rule in God's name
[4102.24 --> 4102.72]  with him.
[4104.66 --> 4105.50]  These stories
[4105.50 --> 4106.76]  don't end in Genesis.
[4109.36 --> 4110.30]  They carry throughout
[4110.30 --> 4111.16]  the whole Old Testament.
[4111.16 --> 4112.58]  God continues to rule
[4112.58 --> 4113.82]  in his power and love.
[4114.32 --> 4115.22]  He continues to dwell
[4115.22 --> 4115.86]  with his people
[4115.86 --> 4116.82]  and works to make
[4116.82 --> 4117.94]  the world very good.
[4118.96 --> 4119.76]  Parallel to this,
[4119.84 --> 4120.40]  there is a story
[4120.40 --> 4121.18]  of a human ruler
[4121.18 --> 4122.56]  who will rule in God's name
[4122.56 --> 4123.56]  and do the work
[4123.56 --> 4124.30]  that God gives him
[4124.30 --> 4124.96]  in full obedience.
[4126.18 --> 4127.24]  In the Gospels,
[4127.34 --> 4128.34]  those two stories meet.
[4129.30 --> 4130.12]  The Almighty God
[4130.12 --> 4131.64]  loves the humanity
[4131.64 --> 4132.42]  that he created
[4132.42 --> 4133.86]  in his image so much
[4133.86 --> 4135.36]  that he comes down
[4135.36 --> 4136.08]  and becomes one.
[4136.90 --> 4138.40]  And he rules in God's name
[4138.40 --> 4139.04]  and does the work
[4139.04 --> 4140.12]  that his Father gives him.
[4141.16 --> 4144.36]  Jesus, as we know,
[4144.56 --> 4146.32]  is our God made flesh.
[4147.24 --> 4148.32]  He came as a human baby,
[4148.56 --> 4149.38]  lived a human life
[4149.38 --> 4150.12]  with all its struggles
[4150.12 --> 4151.16]  and pains and joys,
[4151.50 --> 4153.30]  and died on the cross
[4153.30 --> 4154.20]  and took the sin
[4154.20 --> 4154.88]  from the world
[4154.88 --> 4156.12]  so that he could redeem it.
[4158.16 --> 4160.04]  Colossians 1, 15-17
[4160.04 --> 4161.46]  writes this beautiful capstone
[4161.46 --> 4162.38]  on the whole topic
[4162.38 --> 4163.00]  of creation.
[4163.00 --> 4165.66]  He is the image
[4165.66 --> 4166.74]  of the invisible God,
[4167.26 --> 4168.94]  the firstborn of all creation.
[4169.66 --> 4170.30]  For by him,
[4170.34 --> 4171.22]  all things were created
[4171.22 --> 4172.34]  in the heavens and on earth,
[4172.68 --> 4173.56]  visible or invisible,
[4173.72 --> 4174.94]  whether thrones or dominions
[4174.94 --> 4176.36]  or rulers or authorities.
[4176.64 --> 4177.70]  All things were created
[4177.70 --> 4178.68]  through him and for him.
[4179.40 --> 4180.56]  And he is before all things
[4180.56 --> 4180.98]  and in him,
[4181.06 --> 4181.94]  all things hold together.
[4182.76 --> 4183.70]  So the first answer
[4183.70 --> 4185.44]  to Eric's question
[4185.44 --> 4188.08]  about when was the world created,
[4188.58 --> 4190.24]  Jesus was the correct answer.
[4190.24 --> 4191.82]  The Bible testifies to it.
[4192.22 --> 4192.96]  So whoever said that,
[4193.16 --> 4193.58]  great job.
[4194.22 --> 4194.54]  There you go.
[4195.88 --> 4196.68]  Jesus is here
[4196.68 --> 4197.66]  because he's not done
[4197.66 --> 4198.50]  with his creation.
[4199.70 --> 4200.12]  In fact,
[4200.18 --> 4201.82]  because we messed it up so bad,
[4202.24 --> 4203.52]  God is recreating it.
[4204.42 --> 4205.50]  That's some damage.
[4206.66 --> 4206.90]  Therefore,
[4207.04 --> 4208.14]  if anyone is in Christ,
[4208.46 --> 4209.48]  he is a new creation.
[4210.16 --> 4211.28]  The old has passed away
[4211.28 --> 4211.72]  and behold,
[4211.80 --> 4212.64]  the new has come.
[4213.54 --> 4215.06]  We have died in our sins
[4215.06 --> 4216.04]  and have been made new.
[4216.84 --> 4217.76]  And when we die,
[4217.86 --> 4219.00]  we're resurrected with Christ
[4219.00 --> 4220.12]  in the new creation.
[4220.56 --> 4221.14]  The new heavens
[4221.14 --> 4221.92]  and the new earth.
[4223.26 --> 4224.42]  The very same Jesus
[4224.42 --> 4225.32]  that died on the cross
[4225.32 --> 4226.40]  and rose on the third day.
[4226.98 --> 4228.16]  That Jesus was present
[4228.16 --> 4228.86]  in making you
[4228.86 --> 4229.94]  before he saved you.
[4230.76 --> 4232.38]  He designed every rock and tree,
[4232.60 --> 4233.56]  bird and fish,
[4233.76 --> 4234.72]  barren palatopos.
[4236.62 --> 4237.96]  This was all made for him.
[4239.08 --> 4240.26]  We were made for him.
[4241.86 --> 4242.60]  Now again,
[4242.68 --> 4244.04]  he is preparing a place for us
[4244.04 --> 4245.58]  with his immense power
[4245.58 --> 4246.38]  and he is creating
[4246.38 --> 4247.62]  this time a city
[4247.62 --> 4250.06]  in which we will dwell with him
[4250.06 --> 4251.86]  and it will be very good.
[4254.16 --> 4254.88]  So if you noticed,
[4254.94 --> 4255.66]  I didn't talk about
[4255.66 --> 4256.64]  how old the earth is
[4256.64 --> 4257.50]  this whole time.
[4257.84 --> 4258.78]  And there's a reason for that.
[4259.58 --> 4260.76]  When we get into arguments
[4260.76 --> 4262.20]  about how old the earth is,
[4262.32 --> 4263.42]  6,000 years
[4263.42 --> 4264.48]  or 14 billion
[4264.48 --> 4266.42]  or how it was made,
[4266.86 --> 4267.62]  we lose sight
[4267.62 --> 4268.54]  of the real reason
[4268.54 --> 4269.42]  Genesis 1 and 2
[4269.42 --> 4269.82]  were written.
[4270.48 --> 4271.14]  It's not about
[4271.14 --> 4272.36]  the age of some rocks.
[4272.86 --> 4274.22]  It's about who made them.
[4274.22 --> 4276.68]  It's about Yahweh Elohim.
[4279.28 --> 4279.84]  Let's pray.
[4285.90 --> 4286.80]  Lord, thank you
[4286.80 --> 4287.62]  for this day.
[4288.28 --> 4289.52]  Thank you for this wonderful weather.
[4290.76 --> 4291.58]  Thank you for this day
[4291.58 --> 4292.44]  you have made it.
[4292.86 --> 4293.64]  Help us rejoice
[4293.64 --> 4295.84]  and be glad in it.
[4297.12 --> 4297.92]  Lord, I pray that
[4297.92 --> 4298.72]  as they go off
[4298.72 --> 4299.52]  from here
[4299.52 --> 4300.66]  that we would all
[4300.66 --> 4301.82]  continue to worship you
[4301.82 --> 4302.44]  throughout the week
[4302.44 --> 4304.66]  and that you would be with us
[4304.66 --> 4305.30]  and that your spirit
[4305.30 --> 4306.18]  would be with us
[4306.18 --> 4308.12]  and that we would glorify you
[4308.12 --> 4308.66]  in all that we do.
[4309.52 --> 4309.72]  Amen.
[4316.36 --> 4317.44]  Please stand with us
[4317.44 --> 4318.08]  as we sing
[4318.08 --> 4318.94]  God of Wonders.
[4318.94 --> 4319.14]  God of Wonders.
[4319.14 --> 4345.18]  Lord of all creation
[4345.18 --> 4350.38]  God of Wonders.
[4372.92 --> 4375.16]  God of Wonders.
[4375.16 --> 4382.80]  Holy, Holy, the universe declares your majesty.
[4384.88 --> 4396.04]  You are Holy, Holy, Lord of heaven and earth.
[4398.04 --> 4402.64]  Lord of heaven and earth.
[4402.64 --> 4432.62]  Lord of heaven and earth.
[4432.64 --> 4434.64]  Lord of heaven and earth.
[4436.64 --> 4442.64]  I will call your name by night.
[4442.64 --> 4446.36]  Lord of wonders beyond our galaxy.
[4448.46 --> 4459.14]  You are Holy, Holy, the universe declares your majesty.
[4459.14 --> 4473.14]  You are Holy, Holy, Lord of heaven and earth.
[4473.14 --> 4479.14]  Lord of heaven and earth.
[4479.14 --> 4481.14]  You are Holy, Holy, the universe declares your majesty.
[4481.14 --> 4485.14]  You are Holy, Holy, the universe declares your majesty.
[4485.14 --> 4487.14]  You are Holy, Holy, the universe declares your majesty.
[4487.14 --> 4489.14]  You are Holy, Holy, the universe declares your majesty.
[4489.14 --> 4493.14]  You are Holy, Holy.
[4493.14 --> 4499.14]  You are Holy, Holy, the universe declares your majesty.
[4499.14 --> 4503.14]  You are Holy, Holy, the universe declares your majesty.
[4503.14 --> 4513.14]  You are Holy, Holy, the universe declares your majesty.
[4513.14 --> 4520.14]  You are Holy, Holy, the universe declares your majesty.
[4520.14 --> 4523.14]  You are Holy, Holy, the universe declares your majesty.
[4523.14 --> 4530.14]  You are Holy, Holy, Holy, the universe declares your majesty.
[4530.14 --> 4544.14]  You are Holy, Holy, Holy, the universe declares your majesty.
[4544.14 --> 4558.14]  You are Holy, Holy, Holy, you are Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord of heaven and earth.
[4558.14 --> 4562.14]  Lord of heaven and earth.
[4562.14 --> 4576.62]  Here's the parting blessing.
[4577.68 --> 4579.46]  The Lord bless you and keep you.
[4580.20 --> 4582.70]  The Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[4583.22 --> 4586.06]  The Lord turn his face towards you and give you peace.
[4586.94 --> 4587.20]  Amen.
[4592.14 --> 4617.70]  To the amazing one, to the unchanging one,
[4617.70 --> 4625.70]  to him the anthem raise, lift up your hymns of praise.
[4625.70 --> 4642.70]  For all the things he's done, for all the things to come,
[4642.70 --> 4649.70]  to him the anthem raise, lift up a shout out.
[4650.50 --> 4653.70]  Praise him with all of the music.
[4654.64 --> 4657.70]  Praise him with all of the nations.
[4658.88 --> 4662.02]  Praise him with all of creation.
[4662.58 --> 4664.36]  We praise him.
[4664.70 --> 4667.08]  We praise him.
[4667.08 --> 4675.08]  See how the risen one, see the exalted son.
[4676.08 --> 4684.30]  To him the anthem raise, lift up your hymns of praise.
[4684.72 --> 4692.52]  For all the things he's done, for all the things to come.
[4692.52 --> 4699.86]  To him the anthem raise, lift up your shout out.
[4700.30 --> 4702.52]  Praise him with all of your hearts.
[4703.52 --> 4703.92]  Sing.
[4704.38 --> 4707.62]  Praise him in this generation.
[4708.62 --> 4711.82]  Jesus, the light of salvation.
[4712.38 --> 4713.52]  We praise him.
[4713.52 --> 4716.52]  We praise him.
[4717.52 --> 4720.52]  We praise him.
[4720.68 --> 4729.26]  We praise him.
[4729.42 --> 4732.52]  We praise him.
[4732.52 --> 4734.54]  We praise him.
[4734.70 --> 4738.50]  Shine your light, forever and ever.
[4739.58 --> 4742.46]  Shine your light, forever and ever.
[4742.52 --> 4743.06]  Shine your light.
[4743.06 --> 4748.02]  the world
[4750.74 --> 4753.46]  shine your light
[4753.46 --> 4754.68]  Now
[4783.46 --> 4787.62]  Praise Him with all of music
[4787.62 --> 4791.68]  Praise Him in all of creation
[4791.68 --> 4795.90]  Praise Him with all of creation
[4795.90 --> 4800.56]  We praise Him, we praise Him
[4800.56 --> 4804.58]  Praise Him with all of your heart sing
[4804.58 --> 4808.26]  Praise Him in this generation
[4808.26 --> 4812.48]  Jesus, your vital salvation
