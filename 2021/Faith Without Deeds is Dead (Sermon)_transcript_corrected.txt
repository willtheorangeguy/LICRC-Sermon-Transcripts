[0.00 → 3.36] Hey everyone, welcome.
[4.36 → 6.30] I hope you're having a good Sunday so far.
[7.12 → 9.38] It's been a while since the last time I did this,
[9.60 → 13.84] but I remember more people being here the last time I preached.
[15.48 → 18.86] Anyway, I hope everyone's having a good Sunday, like I said already.
[19.44 → 22.20] I want to encourage you to bring out your Bibles in any format
[22.20 → 25.80] and open the word to James 2, 14-19.
[30.00 → 31.46] Read with me.
[31.46 → 37.28] What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds?
[38.00 → 39.34] Can such faith save him?
[40.38 → 43.80] Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food.
[44.60 → 46.68] One of you says to him, Go, I wish you well.
[47.50 → 51.22] Keep warm and well-fed, but does nothing about his physical needs.
[51.30 → 52.02] What good is it?
[53.16 → 57.22] In the same way, faith by itself, if it's not accompanied by actions, is dead.
[57.22 → 60.70] But someone will say, You have faith, I have deeds.
[61.54 → 65.02] Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do.
[65.86 → 67.80] You believe that there is one God good.
[68.42 → 70.66] Even the demons believe that and shudder.
[70.66 → 81.60] When I was in school, I read the book, The Life of Pi.
[82.20 → 84.84] If you haven't read the book, you may have watched the movie,
[84.92 → 88.34] When Our Church Borrowed the Coverdale Cinema for a Mexico fundraiser in 2012.
[89.64 → 92.94] It's a fictional story of a boy from India who's the son of a zookeeper.
[92.94 → 99.02] On a move from India to Canada, he gets lost at sea due to a storm
[99.02 → 104.02] and gets stranded on a small rescue boat with a tiger as his only companion.
[104.96 → 106.46] I highly recommend this book.
[109.20 → 113.40] But there's a traumatic scene in the book where Pi goes to see the tiger at the zoo alone.
[114.52 → 116.58] Now to preface, when I say that this scene is traumatic,
[117.38 → 121.70] I mean that this story presents a very gruesome scene of a tiger killing an animal
[121.70 → 125.80] and an example of horrible parenting technique that should never be replicated.
[128.32 → 129.74] But that's not why I'm telling this story.
[129.92 → 133.26] I'm telling this story because it says something about faith and deeds
[133.26 → 135.30] in a practical and easy way.
[136.14 → 138.58] As I said before, Pi goes to the cage of the tiger
[138.58 → 142.10] because he wants to see the most dangerous animal in the zoo.
[143.12 → 144.56] He knows what a tiger can do.
[145.04 → 147.94] Its power, its teeth, its claws.
[149.10 → 150.74] So Pi goes to the cage to see it.
[151.70 → 155.42] When Pi gets there, the tiger sees him and goes to meet Pi at the cage.
[156.62 → 159.02] Pi was amazed at the tiger's beauty and power.
[159.86 → 163.34] However, right before the tiger reached the cage wall where Pi was,
[163.70 → 165.54] Pi's father pulls him from the cage
[165.54 → 169.18] and saves his life as the tiger's swipe narrowly misses.
[169.18 → 172.14] Now here's the traumatic part.
[176.22 → 179.52] To make sure Pi never goes to the cage ever again,
[180.60 → 184.56] Pi's father makes Pi watch the tiger kill and eat a goat.
[185.82 → 188.14] His father's questionable technique works,
[188.66 → 191.10] and Pi never goes close to the cage ever again.
[191.10 → 192.10] Pi's father's father's father.
[192.10 → 195.42] The reason I told you this story is, as I said before,
[195.58 → 199.02] it says something about faith and deeds in a practical and easy way.
[199.98 → 202.98] Now, of course, this story isn't actually talking about faith and deeds.
[204.14 → 206.80] Pi's story here is talking about knowledge and action.
[207.70 → 211.24] But the relationship between knowledge and action is analogous to faith and deeds.
[211.24 → 215.86] That analogy is, if you believe that a tiger is dangerous,
[216.54 → 218.04] and you still walk up to a cage,
[218.56 → 220.06] then your belief doesn't work.
[220.70 → 221.86] It doesn't change you.
[222.60 → 223.22] It's useless.
[223.72 → 225.78] And as James would say, it's dead.
[228.08 → 230.08] But if you believe that a tiger is dangerous,
[230.48 → 231.76] and don't walk up to a cage,
[232.34 → 233.48] don't walk up to a cage,
[234.06 → 237.38] it means that as a result of your faith, you did something.
[238.42 → 240.38] It means your faith works, it's effective,
[240.38 → 242.08] and your faith is alive.
[243.40 → 246.02] In the passage today, James has been getting at this point
[246.02 → 248.10] that the life of Pi also expresses.
[249.50 → 251.68] It's this idea of two types of faith.
[253.20 → 254.48] A faith that is alone,
[255.10 → 256.24] and a faith that works.
[258.00 → 260.36] Faith that is alone is a faith that's isolated.
[260.94 → 262.60] Faith that only lives in the mind.
[263.30 → 265.94] A faith that doesn't have any effect on a person's actions,
[266.60 → 267.86] attitudes, or habits.
[267.86 → 270.86] Faith that doesn't affect the person's reality.
[272.04 → 274.64] The other type of faith is a faith that works.
[275.34 → 276.42] A faith with deeds.
[277.18 → 278.52] A faith that does something.
[279.08 → 280.66] A faith that changes a person.
[281.26 → 283.72] Or as Chris and Kevin have been preaching every Sunday.
[284.50 → 286.10] A faith that seeks wisdom.
[286.78 → 289.04] A faith that is steadfast in the trial.
[289.90 → 292.58] A faith that is slow to anger and quick to listen.
[292.58 → 294.88] A faith that does what it hears.
[295.88 → 298.04] A faith that visits the orphan and the widow.
[298.34 → 301.40] And a faith that is not partial to the rich over the poor.
[301.40 → 313.20] If you summarize everything James says into one phrase,
[313.26 → 313.86] it would be this.
[314.52 → 316.10] We are saved through faith alone,
[316.80 → 319.30] but a faith that saves is never alone.
[320.58 → 323.46] Be a hearer and a doer, not just a hearer.
[324.48 → 326.54] True faith changes a person.
[327.08 → 328.38] It changes how we behave.
[328.38 → 331.96] It affects how we speak to each other and how we look at life.
[332.14 → 334.30] And in turn, good deeds follow.
[335.32 → 337.42] It's important to note that deeds do not save.
[338.16 → 339.32] James never claims that.
[339.98 → 342.90] And I'm going to hit that note multiple times throughout this sermon
[342.90 → 345.08] to make sure it's clear that I don't claim it.
[346.16 → 350.58] James completely affirms the passage found in Ephesians 2, 8-9.
[350.58 → 355.50] For it is by grace you have been saved through faith.
[355.90 → 357.14] And this is not from yourselves.
[357.72 → 361.62] It is a gift of God, not by works, so that no one can boast.
[362.94 → 365.80] Deeds following faith is where the passage starts.
[366.14 → 368.12] And it's threaded through the whole passage today.
[369.08 → 370.40] We'll get back to Ephesians later.
[372.16 → 373.70] James starts by saying,
[373.70 → 395.04] We're given an example of the first kind of faith.
[395.64 → 398.48] Faith that is alone and doesn't do anything.
[399.04 → 401.14] And this is expressed in James' opening question.
[401.14 → 405.52] What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds?
[406.40 → 408.56] This kind of faith is only in the mind.
[409.32 → 410.84] This faith has no deeds,
[410.94 → 412.90] which means that if someone were to have this kind of faith,
[413.24 → 415.76] it would not affect their reality or their world.
[417.34 → 420.36] In no way does this kind of faith affect the way a person behaves
[420.36 → 422.30] or treats others in any positive way.
[422.98 → 426.48] Or in Pi's case, this kind of faith won't stop you from going to the tiger's cage.
[428.10 → 430.60] James goes on to give an example of this kind of faith.
[430.60 → 433.58] And he describes a scene that is not that dissimilar from the beginning
[433.58 → 436.26] of the Good Samaritan found in Luke chapter 10.
[437.92 → 441.62] Someone walks past a brother or sister who is clearly in need.
[442.26 → 444.96] They're described as someone without clothes and without food.
[445.74 → 448.38] This person has a clear description of poverty.
[449.34 → 452.16] And the person passing by doesn't give them anything
[452.16 → 454.16] or help them in any way.
[454.66 → 455.44] They just say,
[455.44 → 457.00] Go, I wish you well.
[457.58 → 459.40] Keep warm and be well-fed.
[463.22 → 465.00] In this hypothetical situation,
[465.58 → 467.80] the person speaking knows what they should do
[467.80 → 469.40] by their own admission.
[470.10 → 472.16] They have faith, so to speak.
[472.28 → 474.16] They know they need to help their brother in need,
[474.36 → 475.90] but they don't act on it.
[475.90 → 478.58] I think James brings up this example
[478.58 → 480.22] because we all do this.
[481.84 → 484.06] Countless times, driving or walking,
[484.96 → 487.40] I've passed someone who's in a similar situation
[487.40 → 488.50] to this person,
[488.90 → 489.74] and I say to myself,
[489.88 → 491.64] Man, I really hope they find some food
[491.64 → 492.86] and get a place to sleep tonight.
[493.18 → 494.12] It's going to get cold.
[495.42 → 496.52] And admittedly, most of the time,
[496.56 → 497.74] I don't do anything about it.
[498.78 → 499.76] My faith was alone.
[500.10 → 501.00] I knew they needed something,
[501.08 → 502.42] and I didn't do anything.
[502.42 → 505.64] Now, I'm not highlighting this point
[505.64 → 508.22] so you go and help every person in need,
[508.72 → 510.24] but if we never help,
[511.30 → 513.12] then maybe we need to reflect.
[514.64 → 516.10] James is asking us to decide
[516.10 → 518.36] that if we feel so convicted by God
[518.36 → 519.52] to help,
[519.66 → 520.82] then maybe we should.
[522.90 → 524.36] James ends this story
[524.36 → 526.00] with another question and an answer.
[526.50 → 527.34] What good is it?
[528.02 → 528.86] In the same way,
[529.00 → 530.54] faith by itself,
[530.54 → 532.64] if it's not accompanied by actions,
[532.78 → 533.28] is dead.
[534.30 → 535.62] James has asked this question,
[535.74 → 536.90] what good is it, twice now?
[537.34 → 538.28] But James doesn't say
[538.28 → 539.24] that the faith without deeds
[539.24 → 540.46] is not good.
[541.50 → 543.04] He says it's dead.
[544.72 → 546.24] In a very explicit way,
[546.34 → 548.36] James responds by saying
[548.36 → 549.28] that faith without works
[549.28 → 550.96] is like a body without a soul.
[552.18 → 553.36] It doesn't do anything.
[554.36 → 555.88] It's simply just there.
[555.88 → 558.12] And again,
[558.18 → 559.28] I want to affirm
[559.28 → 560.44] that James is not saying
[560.44 → 561.40] that deeds save you.
[562.38 → 563.98] James affirms that faith saves
[563.98 → 564.68] by his question,
[564.84 → 566.28] can that faith save him?
[567.16 → 568.20] He wants us to understand
[568.20 → 569.12] that faith saves,
[569.26 → 571.10] but deeds should follow
[571.10 → 571.96] from that faith.
[572.46 → 574.00] Good deeds act as a signal
[574.00 → 575.08] to true faith.
[576.68 → 577.90] Saved through faith,
[578.46 → 578.84] alone.
[579.30 → 580.30] But a faith that saves
[580.30 → 581.10] is never alone.
[581.10 → 584.62] In verse 18 to 19,
[585.28 → 586.12] James proposes
[586.12 → 587.44] a hypothetical response
[587.44 → 588.58] from someone who disagrees
[588.58 → 590.10] with his teaching so far.
[591.94 → 593.04] But someone will say,
[593.22 → 593.84] you have faith,
[594.10 → 594.90] I have deeds.
[595.96 → 596.90] Show me your faith
[596.90 → 597.40] without deeds,
[597.46 → 598.02] and I will show you
[598.02 → 599.18] my faith by what I do.
[599.74 → 600.52] You believe there is
[600.52 → 601.34] one God, good.
[601.94 → 603.26] Even the demons believe that
[603.26 → 604.14] and shudder.
[608.18 → 609.68] This opponent supposes
[609.68 → 611.08] that the two can be separated.
[611.46 → 612.62] That you can have faith
[612.62 → 613.30] without deeds.
[614.44 → 615.40] But as we've seen,
[615.50 → 616.38] James makes this case
[616.38 → 617.12] over and over again
[617.12 → 617.82] that if you separate
[617.82 → 618.52] faith and deeds,
[618.60 → 619.28] then you have a faith
[619.28 → 619.90] that is alone.
[620.96 → 621.86] A faith that doesn't
[621.86 → 622.36] do anything,
[622.44 → 623.26] and a faith like that
[623.26 → 623.96] is dead.
[625.56 → 627.10] So he hits the same point again
[627.10 → 628.50] by expressing what
[628.50 → 629.88] the second kind of faith is.
[630.40 → 631.74] I will show you my faith
[631.74 → 632.90] by what I do.
[633.82 → 635.56] Deeds following faith.
[637.06 → 637.94] Deeds are an expression
[637.94 → 638.78] of a true faith
[638.78 → 639.52] in the same way
[639.52 → 640.66] that an apple on a tree
[640.66 → 641.32] tells you,
[641.92 → 643.04] you have an apple tree.
[645.40 → 646.08] James goes on
[646.08 → 646.80] to hit the point home
[646.80 → 647.92] by invoking a fundamental
[647.92 → 649.02] belief to both Jews
[649.02 → 649.68] and the church.
[650.76 → 651.38] James writes,
[651.48 → 652.22] you believe there is
[652.22 → 653.48] one God, good.
[654.32 → 654.96] Even the demons
[654.96 → 655.98] believe that and shudder.
[657.06 → 657.76] The phrase,
[657.94 → 658.84] believe God is one,
[659.38 → 660.04] that James here
[660.04 → 660.74] is referring to
[660.74 → 661.98] is one of the core features
[661.98 → 663.18] of the Jewish faith.
[663.30 → 664.14] This idea of God
[664.14 → 664.68] being one
[664.68 → 666.74] comes from Deuteronomy 6.4.
[668.04 → 669.02] Hear, O Israel,
[669.52 → 670.54] the Lord our God,
[670.94 → 672.56] the Lord is one.
[675.28 → 676.02] God commanded
[676.02 → 676.70] the Israelite people
[676.70 → 677.92] to keep these words
[677.92 → 678.38] to heart,
[679.06 → 679.74] to say them
[679.74 → 680.94] every single day,
[681.28 → 681.84] to write them
[681.84 → 682.46] on their walls,
[682.54 → 683.10] on their houses,
[683.10 → 683.98] and to teach them
[683.98 → 685.30] every chance they get.
[686.58 → 687.28] James brings up
[687.28 → 687.90] this specifically
[687.90 → 688.64] because of something
[688.64 → 690.26] so clearly commanded
[690.26 → 691.24] by God to be memorized
[691.24 → 692.52] and recited
[692.52 → 693.98] every chance they get
[693.98 → 695.14] meant it was important
[695.14 → 695.76] to believe.
[696.30 → 696.64] In fact,
[696.68 → 697.32] it was central
[697.32 → 698.00] to their faith.
[699.64 → 700.62] He states that
[700.62 → 702.06] demons believe this as well.
[703.08 → 703.90] He means that as demons
[703.90 → 705.04] they know God.
[705.70 → 706.62] They believe in him.
[707.08 → 708.00] They don't have debates
[708.00 → 709.48] over whether he might exist
[709.48 → 709.88] or not.
[710.44 → 711.16] They watch him
[711.16 → 712.42] throughout all history.
[712.96 → 713.56] They watched him
[713.56 → 714.40] work for the salvation
[714.40 → 715.12] of humankind.
[715.54 → 716.24] But as we know,
[716.34 → 717.86] they don't do anything good
[717.86 → 719.16] as a result of their faith.
[719.68 → 720.34] After all,
[720.34 → 721.82] they're demons.
[728.26 → 730.18] This man who only has faith
[730.18 → 731.50] in James' hypothetical
[731.50 → 732.72] is described as believing
[732.72 → 733.74] that God is one.
[734.78 → 736.02] James commends this person
[736.02 → 736.74] for believing that
[736.74 → 738.08] because believing that statement
[738.08 → 739.64] is in fact great.
[740.30 → 741.80] It's good that he believes that.
[742.26 → 743.06] James isn't saying
[743.06 → 743.56] that the person
[743.56 → 744.28] is like a demon
[744.28 → 745.86] or is a demon.
[746.28 → 746.96] Not at all.
[747.42 → 748.30] He's encouraging the man
[748.30 → 749.44] that if he believes,
[749.44 → 751.02] then good deeds
[751.02 → 751.94] should follow
[751.94 → 753.54] unlike a demon
[753.54 → 754.54] who does evil.
[756.20 → 756.94] James is trying
[756.94 → 757.50] to tell the reader
[757.50 → 758.20] that you cannot
[758.20 → 759.16] separate the two.
[759.78 → 760.08] And again,
[760.12 → 761.04] I'm repeating myself here
[761.04 → 761.56] so that you know
[761.56 → 762.60] I'm not saying otherwise.
[763.28 → 764.46] James is not teaching
[764.46 → 765.40] that by doing good
[765.40 → 766.60] you can earn salvation.
[767.46 → 768.28] He's saying
[768.28 → 769.88] we are saved
[769.88 → 770.78] through faith alone.
[770.78 → 772.62] but a faith that saves
[772.62 → 774.16] is never alone.
[775.78 → 776.84] We've talked about
[776.84 → 777.44] the idea
[777.44 → 778.46] of deeds following
[778.46 → 779.92] as a result of true faith
[779.92 → 782.04] and also as a signifier
[782.04 → 783.04] showing that that faith
[783.04 → 783.60] is true.
[784.60 → 785.82] This is for us
[785.82 → 787.12] so that we can see
[787.12 → 788.14] that we are being sanctified
[788.14 → 789.04] by the Holy Spirit.
[789.70 → 790.82] We can see that God's promise
[790.82 → 792.06] of making us more like Christ
[792.06 → 793.42] is happening in real time.
[794.32 → 794.98] We can look back
[794.98 → 796.00] at who we used to be
[796.00 → 797.42] and see the power of God
[797.42 → 798.46] working in our life
[798.46 → 799.38] and in turn
[799.38 → 800.62] we draw into him
[800.62 → 801.66] more and more.
[803.62 → 805.06] We know that we as Christians
[805.06 → 806.32] when we're talking about faith
[806.32 → 807.50] we talk about faith
[807.50 → 808.44] in Christ.
[809.42 → 810.54] Jesus says these words
[810.54 → 811.80] that we're all familiar with.
[811.80 → 814.32] For God so loved the world
[814.32 → 815.48] that he gave his one
[815.48 → 816.18] and only Son
[816.18 → 817.74] that whoever believes in him
[817.74 → 818.60] shall not perish
[818.60 → 819.68] but have eternal life.
[820.98 → 823.24] We owe everything to Jesus.
[824.06 → 825.44] If Christ didn't live
[825.44 → 826.26] the perfect life
[826.26 → 827.74] if he didn't preach
[827.74 → 828.36] the gospel
[828.36 → 829.64] if he didn't die
[829.64 → 830.28] on the cross
[830.28 → 831.36] instead of us
[831.36 → 833.00] if he wasn't raised
[833.00 → 833.78] from the dead
[833.78 → 835.42] we would be dead
[835.42 → 836.14] in our sin.
[837.56 → 839.14] It is in Christ alone
[839.14 → 840.10] that we are saved.
[840.10 → 842.42] We also affirm
[842.42 → 843.72] that this is a gift
[843.72 → 845.58] of God's undeserved grace.
[846.38 → 847.56] Ephesians 2.8-9
[847.56 → 848.70] which was mentioned before
[848.70 → 849.84] says
[849.84 → 851.34] for it is by grace
[851.34 → 852.38] you have been saved
[852.38 → 853.24] through faith
[853.24 → 854.64] and this is not
[854.64 → 855.24] from yourselves
[855.24 → 856.30] it is a gift of God
[856.30 → 857.12] not by works
[857.12 → 858.98] so that no one can boast.
[864.50 → 865.54] Nothing we could do
[865.54 → 866.40] could ever earn
[866.40 → 867.40] ourselves salvation.
[867.82 → 868.52] It is by God's
[868.52 → 869.98] sheer grace alone
[869.98 → 871.00] that we are saved.
[871.90 → 873.02] No effort of our own
[873.02 → 873.76] could have saved us
[873.76 → 874.58] and no good deed
[874.58 → 875.36] could have earned it.
[876.00 → 878.42] It is by God's grace alone.
[880.16 → 881.12] The Heidelberg Catechism
[881.12 → 882.24] which we are familiar with
[882.24 → 882.82] if you grew up
[882.82 → 883.48] in this church
[883.48 → 885.18] or other CRC churches
[885.18 → 886.30] we learned it
[886.30 → 886.86] in our youth
[886.86 → 888.86] some have even memorized it
[888.86 → 889.54] to an extent.
[890.22 → 891.46] It serves as a concise
[891.46 → 892.42] and thorough teaching
[892.42 → 893.04] of the truths
[893.04 → 893.86] that we believe
[893.86 → 895.16] the Bible teaches.
[895.98 → 896.82] This catechism
[896.82 → 898.20] encapsulates James' teaching
[898.20 → 899.32] in a few of the Lord's Days.
[900.36 → 901.92] The Lord's Day 7 says
[901.92 → 903.70] true faith
[903.70 → 905.36] is not only a knowledge
[905.36 → 905.96] and a conviction
[905.96 → 907.32] that everything God reveals
[907.32 → 908.38] in His Word is true
[908.38 → 910.48] is a deep-rooted assurance
[910.48 → 911.26] created in me
[911.26 → 912.14] by the Holy Spirit
[912.14 → 912.82] through the Gospel
[912.82 → 914.72] that out of sheer grace
[914.72 → 915.60] earned for us
[915.60 → 916.62] by Christ
[916.62 → 918.12] not only others
[918.12 → 918.84] but I too
[918.84 → 921.26] have had my sins forgiven
[921.26 → 922.78] have been made forever
[922.78 → 923.58] right with God
[923.58 → 925.72] and have been granted salvation.
[927.60 → 929.12] The Lord's Day 24
[929.12 → 930.42] goes on to say
[930.42 → 931.70] it is impossible
[931.70 → 932.78] for those grafted
[932.78 → 933.92] into Christ
[933.92 → 935.06] by true faith
[935.06 → 936.62] not to produce
[936.62 → 937.74] fruits of gratitude.
[940.24 → 942.24] James has been teaching us
[942.24 → 943.14] that good deeds
[943.14 → 944.26] follow faith.
[944.62 → 945.16] These deeds
[945.16 → 946.16] don't save us
[946.16 → 947.20] they couldn't.
[947.96 → 948.68] When James says
[948.68 → 949.20] that deeds
[949.20 → 950.92] accompany good faith
[950.92 → 951.54] it's because
[951.54 → 952.48] we are being made
[952.48 → 953.58] like Christ
[953.58 → 955.26] we're being sanctified.
[955.84 → 956.36] The Holy Spirit
[956.36 → 957.34] is working out salvation
[957.34 → 957.78] in us
[957.78 → 959.60] to be more like Christ
[959.60 → 961.00] every single day
[961.00 → 961.98] which means that
[961.98 → 963.08] because we are being saved
[963.08 → 964.04] and being made
[964.04 → 964.92] more like Christ
[964.92 → 966.60] we then will act
[966.60 → 967.46] more like Christ
[967.46 → 968.54] for the more
[968.54 → 969.38] any good we do
[969.38 → 969.94] is because of
[969.94 → 970.86] His strength.
[971.62 → 972.56] We can never do good
[972.56 → 973.26] in God's eyes
[973.26 → 973.92] if it wasn't for
[973.92 → 974.48] His strength
[974.48 → 975.80] His goodness
[975.80 → 977.34] His faithfulness
[977.34 → 978.52] and His Spirit
[978.52 → 979.18] working in us
[979.18 → 980.22] to sanctify us.
[980.22 → 981.64] verse 10
[981.64 → 982.20] of the Ephesians
[982.20 → 982.60] passage
[982.60 → 983.52] affirms this
[983.52 → 985.30] for we are
[985.30 → 986.08] God's workmanship
[986.08 → 987.96] created in Christ
[987.96 → 988.32] Jesus
[988.32 → 990.26] to do good works
[990.26 → 991.36] which God
[991.36 → 992.12] prepared in advance
[992.12 → 992.82] for us to do.
[993.86 → 994.74] Christ obtained
[994.74 → 995.76] salvation for us
[995.76 → 996.50] through His blood
[996.50 → 997.56] the ultimate
[997.56 → 998.46] good deed
[998.46 → 999.32] the deed above
[999.32 → 1000.68] all other deeds
[1000.68 → 1002.10] therefore since
[1002.10 → 1002.66] our deeds
[1002.66 → 1003.48] don't earn us
[1003.48 → 1004.00] salvation
[1004.00 → 1005.14] they are fruits
[1005.14 → 1005.88] of gratitude
[1005.88 → 1006.62] and obedience
[1006.62 → 1007.94] we do these
[1007.94 → 1008.40] good things
[1008.40 → 1009.40] because we have
[1009.40 → 1010.30] been saved
[1010.30 → 1011.74] because He saved us
[1011.74 → 1012.72] we obey His commands
[1012.72 → 1013.50] out of love
[1013.50 → 1015.04] all because God
[1015.04 → 1016.04] had grace on us
[1016.04 → 1017.44] and in conclusion
[1017.44 → 1018.28] we are saved
[1018.28 → 1019.70] by grace alone
[1019.70 → 1021.88] by Christ
[1021.88 → 1022.78] alone
[1022.78 → 1024.12] by faith
[1024.12 → 1025.18] alone
[1025.18 → 1026.32] but a faith
[1026.32 → 1026.98] that saves
[1026.98 → 1028.20] is never alone
[1028.20 → 1028.98] true faith
[1028.98 → 1030.12] is always accompanied
[1030.12 → 1031.06] by good deeds
[1031.06 → 1032.62] not to earn salvation
[1032.62 → 1033.84] but out of gratitude
[1033.84 → 1034.90] and obedience
[1034.90 → 1036.16] for being saved
[1036.16 → 1038.06] these deeds
[1038.06 → 1038.74] of gratitude
[1038.74 → 1039.28] and obedience
[1039.28 → 1040.10] signify that we
[1040.10 → 1041.12] have true faith
[1041.12 → 1042.38] so as members
[1042.38 → 1043.06] of the church
[1043.06 → 1044.26] as the body
[1044.26 → 1044.80] of Christ
[1044.80 → 1045.98] go and be
[1045.98 → 1046.92] like Christ
[1046.92 → 1048.28] go do
[1048.28 → 1049.14] the work
[1049.14 → 1050.34] the good deeds
[1050.34 → 1051.08] God made you
[1051.08 → 1051.54] to do
[1051.54 → 1052.90] with His strength
[1052.90 → 1053.90] because you
[1053.90 → 1054.38] and I
[1054.38 → 1055.18] have been saved
[1055.18 → 1058.84] let's pray
[1058.84 → 1063.08] our Father
[1063.08 → 1064.24] thank You
[1064.24 → 1064.82] for this day
[1064.82 → 1066.46] thank You, Lord
[1066.46 → 1066.90] that we get to
[1066.90 → 1067.70] hear Your Word
[1067.70 → 1070.18] get to say Your Word
[1070.18 → 1071.98] thank You, Lord
[1071.98 → 1072.46] that we get to
[1072.46 → 1073.26] know Your truth
[1073.26 → 1074.92] and get to be
[1074.92 → 1076.16] made more like Christ
[1076.16 → 1077.02] and we don't have
[1077.02 → 1078.00] to stay the way
[1078.00 → 1079.74] we normally are
[1079.74 → 1081.24] our sinful selves
[1081.24 → 1082.14] thank You
[1082.14 → 1082.92] for Your grace
[1082.92 → 1084.22] and Your goodness
[1084.22 → 1085.40] and Your love
[1085.40 → 1087.18] that we do not
[1087.18 → 1087.60] deserve
[1087.60 → 1088.68] and that was
[1088.68 → 1089.54] earned for us
[1089.54 → 1090.38] on our behalf
[1090.38 → 1092.68] because we
[1092.68 → 1093.42] couldn't do it
[1093.42 → 1094.92] we never could
[1094.92 → 1097.00] thank You, Lord
[1097.00 → 1097.74] for Your love
[1097.74 → 1099.10] and Your patience
[1099.10 → 1100.00] with our faultiness
[1100.00 → 1101.54] and when we do
[1101.54 → 1102.44] not do what we
[1102.44 → 1102.80] hear
[1102.80 → 1104.32] when we do not
[1104.32 → 1104.78] act
[1104.78 → 1105.58] when we should
[1105.58 → 1106.48] when we have
[1106.48 → 1106.86] faith
[1106.86 → 1108.48] I pray that You
[1108.48 → 1109.48] would instill in us
[1109.48 → 1110.34] truer and truer
[1110.34 → 1110.84] faith
[1110.84 → 1111.96] and that we would
[1111.96 → 1112.60] continue to be
[1112.60 → 1113.58] sanctified by Your
[1113.58 → 1114.06] Spirit
[1114.06 → 1115.72] and become more
[1115.72 → 1116.34] like Christ
[1116.34 → 1117.60] to do Your work
[1117.60 → 1119.66] and I pray Lord
[1119.66 → 1120.62] that we would
[1120.62 → 1121.50] continue to glorify
[1121.50 → 1122.58] You in all that we
[1122.58 → 1122.86] do
[1122.86 → 1124.50] Amen
