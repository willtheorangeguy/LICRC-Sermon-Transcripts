[0.00 → 7.44] With my hands lifted high, oh God, the battle belongs to you.
[7.86 → 14.92] And every fear I lay at your feet, I'll see through the night.
[15.46 → 19.14] Oh God, the battle belongs to you.
[19.14 → 32.50] And if you are for me, who can be against me?
[37.08 → 44.14] For Jesus, there's nothing impossible for you.
[44.14 → 74.12] For Jesus, there's nothing impossible for you.
[74.14 → 80.04] With my hands lifted high, oh God, the battle belongs to you.
[80.34 → 87.52] And every fear I lay at your feet, I'll see through the night.
[88.08 → 92.14] Oh God, the battle belongs to you.
[92.14 → 98.04] Oh God, the battle belongs to you.
[98.04 → 101.94] You go before us.
[101.94 → 107.08] Nothing can stand against the power of our God.
[107.62 → 109.98] You shine in the shadow.
[110.68 → 113.00] You win every battle.
[114.34 → 118.96] Nothing can stand against the power of our God.
[118.96 → 120.96] In all mighty fortunes.
[120.96 → 124.96] You go before us.
[124.96 → 130.86] Nothing can stand against the power of our God.
[130.86 → 132.86] You shine in the shadow.
[132.86 → 136.74] You win every battle.
[136.74 → 142.86] Nothing can stand against the power of our God.
[142.86 → 144.86] In all mighty fortunes.
[144.86 → 146.06] In all mighty fortunes.
[146.06 → 148.86] You go before us.
[148.86 → 150.86] Nothing can stand against the power of our God.
[150.86 → 154.76] Nothing can stand against the power of our God.
[154.76 → 156.76] You shine in the shadow.
[156.76 → 160.76] You win every battle.
[160.76 → 162.76] You win every battle.
[162.76 → 166.76] Nothing can stand against the power of our God.
[166.76 → 168.76] Oh God, the battle belongs to you.
[168.76 → 169.76] Oh God, the battle belongs to you.
[169.76 → 170.76] Oh God, the battle belongs to you.
[170.76 → 175.76] And every fear I lay at your feet, I'll see through the night.
[175.76 → 177.76] Oh God, the battle belongs to you.
[177.76 → 206.26] Oh God, the battle belongs to you.

[2997.52 → 3027.52] Thank you.
[3027.52 → 3057.52] Thank you.
[3057.52 → 3058.52] Thank you.
[3058.52 → 3088.52] Thank you.
[3088.52 → 3089.52] And for you.
[3089.52 → 3090.52] Thank you.
[3090.52 → 3091.52] Thank you.
[3091.52 → 3093.52] Thank you.
[3121.52 → 3122.52] Thank you.
[3122.52 → 3123.52] Thank you.
[3123.52 → 3124.52] Thank you.
[3124.52 → 3125.52] Thank you.
[3125.52 → 3126.52] Thank you.
[3153.52 → 3154.52] And for you.
[3154.52 → 3155.52] And for you.
[3155.52 → 3156.52] And for you.
[3156.52 → 3158.52] And for you.
[3158.52 → 3160.52] And for you.
[3160.52 → 3161.52] And for you.
[3161.52 → 3164.52] And for you.
[3164.52 → 3170.48] And you ah,
[3170.52 → 3172.62] that we have up or you.
[3172.62 → 3174.52] And the cross, you forward, right.
[3174.52 → 3175.54] Yeah.
[3175.54 → 3176.52] I'm so, you cars, anyway.
[3176.52 → 3177.04] And for you, that you are, you know.
[3177.04 → 3189.84] So, I'm Oh, my gosh, thank you to use, I feel you, I think.
[3189.84 → 3191.86] our Lord. Amen.
[3193.24 → 3193.76] Amen.
[3199.82 → 3201.98] As I mentioned,
[3202.52 → 3205.64] we have been going through
[3205.64 → 3207.80] a series here called
[3207.80 → 3208.76] Ask Anything,
[3209.74 → 3212.00] where we had an opportunity to
[3212.00 → 3214.10] receive questions from you
[3214.10 → 3216.00] and online
[3216.00 → 3217.66] and digitally and personally,
[3217.66 → 3219.28] and then we would spend the summer
[3219.28 → 3220.46] answering them.
[3221.28 → 3223.52] We had to make some changes for what was today.
[3223.66 → 3224.72] I've explained that already.
[3225.52 → 3227.54] And so this morning, we're going to pick up
[3227.54 → 3228.80] a conversation
[3228.80 → 3231.06] around issues of
[3231.06 → 3232.92] fertility and
[3232.92 → 3235.60] fertility treatments and how Christians
[3235.60 → 3237.02] can best
[3237.02 → 3239.52] be present in the midst of that
[3239.52 → 3241.44] and what sort of theological and
[3241.44 → 3243.40] ethical issues arise
[3243.40 → 3245.48] in those sorts of conversations.
[3246.32 → 3247.82] Now, as a matter of
[3247.82 → 3248.96] principle,
[3249.28 → 3250.20] I want to say that
[3250.20 → 3252.58] sometimes the best answer
[3252.58 → 3253.98] to a good question
[3253.98 → 3256.72] is a story of
[3256.72 → 3257.92] God at work.
[3259.20 → 3260.08] So sometimes
[3260.08 → 3261.94] the best way that we can answer
[3261.94 → 3263.30] a question is just to
[3263.30 → 3264.96] look at a life lived
[3264.96 → 3266.22] in the midst of
[3266.22 → 3268.04] the struggles that we are
[3268.04 → 3269.30] recognizing and face.
[3269.96 → 3271.48] And so this morning,
[3272.32 → 3273.50] instead of me
[3273.50 → 3274.88] talking to you
[3274.88 → 3276.58] for some time,
[3276.58 → 3278.50] we're going to hear the testimony
[3278.50 → 3279.94] of some friends of mine.
[3280.32 → 3281.28] And so I'm going to
[3281.28 → 3282.54] introduce you to
[3282.54 → 3284.16] Josh and April Zuniga.
[3285.22 → 3286.38] Josh and
[3286.38 → 3286.80] April,
[3287.30 → 3288.60] Rachel and I met
[3288.60 → 3290.16] when we went to Grand Rapids
[3290.16 → 3291.40] and went to seminary there.
[3291.88 → 3293.02] And for the last
[3293.02 → 3293.92] 12,
[3294.18 → 3295.26] 15 years,
[3295.26 → 3296.70] we've lived life
[3296.70 → 3297.38] with them
[3297.38 → 3298.38] and we've walked
[3298.38 → 3299.50] a journey with them.
[3299.50 → 3300.98] And they have a powerful
[3300.98 → 3301.86] story to share.
[3302.04 → 3302.30] And so
[3302.30 → 3306.22] because I believe
[3306.22 → 3307.86] that stories of
[3307.86 → 3308.98] God transforming
[3308.98 → 3310.60] people will fuel
[3310.60 → 3312.08] God's transforming
[3312.08 → 3312.92] us
[3312.92 → 3313.76] when we hear them,
[3314.12 → 3314.80] we're going to listen
[3314.80 → 3315.88] to their story
[3315.88 → 3316.76] this morning.
[3317.50 → 3318.64] I also want to hold
[3318.64 → 3319.92] this out as an example
[3319.92 → 3321.14] and an opportunity
[3321.14 → 3321.98] for us
[3321.98 → 3323.58] to be the kind of people
[3323.58 → 3324.64] who can share
[3324.64 → 3325.96] these sorts of stories,
[3325.96 → 3327.44] to be the kind of people
[3327.44 → 3329.16] who can get into
[3329.16 → 3329.88] the mess
[3329.88 → 3330.74] and the chaoses
[3330.74 → 3332.62] of life together.
[3333.14 → 3333.38] And so,
[3333.46 → 3333.70] of course,
[3333.76 → 3334.58] not everyone is going
[3334.58 → 3335.62] to do that with everyone.
[3336.14 → 3337.08] And Josh and April
[3337.08 → 3338.06] will give us some examples
[3338.06 → 3338.58] of that.
[3338.66 → 3339.72] But it is important
[3339.72 → 3341.26] that we have some people
[3341.26 → 3342.52] in our lives
[3342.52 → 3345.00] who can journey with us
[3345.00 → 3346.34] whatever we may face.
[3346.84 → 3347.60] The story that we are
[3347.60 → 3348.22] about to hear
[3348.22 → 3349.78] is an example of why
[3349.78 → 3350.62] I think that
[3350.62 → 3351.78] is important.
[3352.06 → 3352.70] And so I'm going to
[3352.70 → 3353.62] hand it over to them
[3353.62 → 3355.40] as we watch this video
[3355.40 → 3356.78] that we've put together.
[3357.54 → 3358.40] I gave them
[3358.40 → 3359.44] a series of questions
[3359.44 → 3361.18] and if they were here,
[3361.28 → 3361.78] we would have done
[3361.78 → 3363.00] this sort of interview style,
[3363.16 → 3364.00] but they're in Ontario.
[3364.68 → 3365.84] And so because of that,
[3366.00 → 3367.60] we will do it this way.
[3368.08 → 3369.72] And then after they have finished,
[3369.80 → 3370.42] I will come up
[3370.42 → 3371.34] and close us out
[3371.34 → 3372.42] with prayer here.
[3373.54 → 3375.52] Let's hear from Josh and April.
[3378.22 → 3380.60] Hello, we're Josh and April
[3380.60 → 3382.70] and we're in Ontario
[3382.70 → 3383.82] and Pastor Chris
[3383.82 → 3384.64] has invited us
[3384.64 → 3385.74] to talk a little bit
[3385.74 → 3388.64] about infertility
[3388.64 → 3390.40] and things around that.
[3390.90 → 3391.82] And that is a struggle
[3391.82 → 3392.94] that April and I
[3392.94 → 3393.80] have gone through
[3393.80 → 3395.32] and continue to go through.
[3395.48 → 3396.32] It's one of those struggles
[3396.32 → 3397.76] that never ends,
[3397.98 → 3398.44] I think.
[3398.62 → 3400.66] But yeah,
[3400.70 → 3401.66] we started when we
[3401.66 → 3402.62] when we got married,
[3402.74 → 3405.24] we year after that or so,
[3405.30 → 3406.42] then we discovered
[3406.42 → 3407.30] that we were unable
[3407.30 → 3408.16] to have children.
[3408.16 → 3416.02] and so I think that for us,
[3416.08 → 3418.68] that was really devastating news.
[3418.76 → 3419.64] It was hard to share.
[3419.72 → 3420.42] It felt like it was
[3420.42 → 3421.44] a really personal thing.
[3422.10 → 3423.52] But we made a decision early
[3423.52 → 3425.06] to share with lots of people
[3425.06 → 3425.54] about it
[3425.54 → 3426.76] and we had a lot of people
[3426.76 → 3428.10] praying for us through it.
[3428.80 → 3429.24] And so,
[3429.24 → 3431.30] yeah,
[3431.34 → 3432.48] we have a big story
[3432.48 → 3433.84] around that.
[3434.34 → 3435.44] You want to add anything to that?
[3436.86 → 3437.88] There's lots to add.
[3437.96 → 3438.84] I think we both knew
[3438.84 → 3439.72] that we wanted kids.
[3439.80 → 3440.78] We both come from families
[3440.78 → 3441.62] with four kids.
[3441.84 → 3443.42] And so we sort of had in our minds
[3443.42 → 3445.00] that we also wanted four kids.
[3445.00 → 3447.46] And we quickly figured out
[3447.46 → 3448.80] what the problem was
[3448.80 → 3449.52] and knew that
[3449.52 → 3451.38] if we wanted to have kids at all,
[3451.92 → 3453.74] it wasn't going to be
[3453.74 → 3454.86] an easy road for us
[3454.86 → 3455.38] in that
[3455.38 → 3457.66] when you first start
[3457.66 → 3458.66] with fertility stuff,
[3458.72 → 3460.12] there are all kinds of questions.
[3460.24 → 3461.32] There are all kinds of appointments.
[3462.20 → 3463.84] There are all kinds of people
[3463.84 → 3465.06] giving you advice
[3465.06 → 3465.78] and input
[3465.78 → 3467.18] that you may or may not want.
[3467.86 → 3468.60] And so it was really hard
[3468.60 → 3469.18] to discern
[3469.18 → 3471.14] exactly where God was leading us.
[3472.42 → 3473.90] And thankfully,
[3473.90 → 3475.62] we had a really great
[3475.62 → 3476.60] team of people
[3476.60 → 3477.82] both medically
[3477.82 → 3479.48] and friendship
[3479.48 → 3481.08] and family-wise too
[3481.08 → 3482.08] that were supporting us
[3482.08 → 3483.54] the whole way.
[3483.66 → 3485.02] But it was really,
[3485.16 → 3485.94] really overwhelming
[3485.94 → 3486.60] for sure
[3486.60 → 3487.80] when we started the journey.
[3487.94 → 3488.42] And sometimes
[3488.42 → 3490.50] as we got farther
[3490.50 → 3491.14] into our journey,
[3491.18 → 3492.26] it was still really overwhelming.
[3492.44 → 3493.90] There were a lot of questions
[3493.90 → 3495.42] and things that we didn't understand.
[3496.00 → 3496.48] And again,
[3496.58 → 3497.36] lots of advice
[3497.36 → 3500.16] that sometimes we didn't want
[3500.16 → 3501.34] or need.
[3501.34 → 3503.76] And so it was a lot.
[3503.90 → 3504.54] For sure.
[3506.62 → 3509.46] So the question here is,
[3509.52 → 3510.96] what are some of the theological issues
[3510.96 → 3512.28] that you wrestled with together?
[3512.82 → 3514.34] And do you have any advice
[3514.34 → 3515.94] for others on how to do this?
[3516.52 → 3517.64] So when we're thinking about,
[3517.88 → 3519.76] our family is built in,
[3520.02 → 3521.18] we have three children
[3521.18 → 3523.54] and they come to us
[3523.54 → 3524.68] by God's grace
[3524.68 → 3525.62] in three different ways.
[3525.62 → 3527.62] And so it's,
[3527.84 → 3530.00] when we,
[3530.58 → 3532.16] we started on the road
[3532.16 → 3532.84] to adoption
[3532.84 → 3534.60] as well as
[3534.60 → 3535.52] having,
[3536.54 → 3537.82] starting in vitro.
[3538.18 → 3538.96] And so
[3538.96 → 3540.12] there are all kinds
[3540.12 → 3541.26] of theological issues
[3541.26 → 3542.34] involved there,
[3542.34 → 3543.16] I think,
[3543.24 → 3544.28] that we had to think about.
[3546.38 → 3547.40] One of them,
[3547.98 → 3549.02] just with adoption,
[3549.26 → 3549.94] so our eldest
[3549.94 → 3550.92] is through adoption
[3550.92 → 3551.50] and she,
[3553.50 → 3554.20] yeah,
[3555.34 → 3555.64] I think
[3555.64 → 3557.16] there's not as many
[3557.16 → 3558.20] theological issues
[3558.20 → 3558.92] to think about.
[3559.44 → 3560.58] But I think about
[3560.58 → 3562.40] that,
[3563.04 → 3565.36] I often marvel at
[3565.36 → 3566.60] the idea
[3566.60 → 3567.72] in the Bible
[3567.72 → 3569.36] that we are adopted
[3569.36 → 3570.50] into God's family.
[3570.58 → 3571.24] And I see that,
[3571.30 → 3572.34] we see that played out
[3572.34 → 3573.08] in our family
[3573.08 → 3575.04] in a smaller scale,
[3575.16 → 3575.46] of course.
[3575.46 → 3576.42] and we're just
[3576.42 → 3577.56] amazed by it.
[3577.74 → 3577.98] And we,
[3578.32 → 3580.36] yeah,
[3580.48 → 3580.96] we're really,
[3581.32 → 3582.40] it moves us
[3582.40 → 3583.36] to praise God
[3583.36 → 3584.40] that we also
[3584.40 → 3585.04] are adopted
[3585.04 → 3586.00] into his family.
[3587.00 → 3587.96] When we talk
[3587.96 → 3589.52] about in vitro,
[3589.60 → 3590.16] we started thinking
[3590.16 → 3590.58] about that.
[3590.66 → 3591.16] There were lots
[3591.16 → 3591.92] of other
[3591.92 → 3593.78] theological questions.
[3594.36 → 3594.82] Like,
[3595.06 → 3596.12] one of them
[3596.12 → 3596.42] is,
[3596.64 → 3599.32] is just
[3599.32 → 3599.92] what makes
[3599.92 → 3600.38] a family
[3600.38 → 3601.36] and how do you
[3601.36 → 3601.70] want to,
[3602.18 → 3603.54] do you want to
[3603.54 → 3604.60] introduce other people
[3604.60 → 3605.14] into that?
[3605.46 → 3605.92] So we,
[3606.22 → 3606.44] you know,
[3606.50 → 3607.26] whether it was
[3607.26 → 3608.30] donor sperm
[3608.30 → 3609.52] or donor egg
[3609.52 → 3610.66] or something like that,
[3610.74 → 3611.42] is that something
[3611.42 → 3611.82] that,
[3612.36 → 3614.00] that we could do?
[3614.08 → 3614.62] We thought a lot
[3614.62 → 3615.06] about that
[3615.06 → 3615.64] and prayed a lot
[3615.64 → 3616.36] about that too.
[3616.96 → 3617.12] And,
[3617.20 → 3618.04] and then
[3618.04 → 3619.12] the other theological
[3619.12 → 3620.04] issue is
[3620.04 → 3620.76] what are you going
[3620.76 → 3621.44] to do with
[3621.44 → 3622.52] the embryos
[3622.52 → 3623.20] that you have?
[3623.80 → 3624.22] And what do you
[3624.22 → 3625.14] think a human life
[3625.14 → 3625.44] is?
[3625.48 → 3626.02] And when does it
[3626.02 → 3626.34] start?
[3626.46 → 3627.24] And those kinds
[3627.24 → 3627.88] of questions.
[3628.56 → 3629.12] And so,
[3629.56 → 3630.58] yeah,
[3630.58 → 3631.04] part of that
[3631.04 → 3631.62] was like
[3631.62 → 3633.10] deciding what
[3633.10 → 3633.68] our commitment
[3633.68 → 3634.34] was
[3634.34 → 3635.96] to any
[3635.96 → 3636.60] and every
[3636.60 → 3637.66] particular embryo
[3637.66 → 3638.48] before we started.
[3639.38 → 3639.84] And so,
[3640.44 → 3640.88] that,
[3641.02 → 3641.74] that's something
[3641.74 → 3642.60] because
[3642.60 → 3643.54] thinking about,
[3644.54 → 3644.96] you know,
[3644.98 → 3645.50] an embryo
[3645.50 → 3645.84] is,
[3645.90 → 3646.84] is life
[3646.84 → 3647.44] and it is
[3647.44 → 3648.42] a person
[3648.42 → 3648.96] and so
[3648.96 → 3649.44] to treat
[3649.44 → 3650.36] that as a person,
[3651.18 → 3652.42] it was really
[3652.42 → 3653.06] important to us
[3653.06 → 3654.02] to think through that.
[3655.08 → 3656.42] The medical
[3656.42 → 3657.44] community today,
[3657.96 → 3658.16] well,
[3658.20 → 3658.50] I don't know
[3658.50 → 3659.04] about the medical
[3659.04 → 3659.48] community,
[3659.48 → 3661.04] but when you're,
[3661.36 → 3661.94] if somebody is
[3661.94 → 3662.46] working through
[3662.46 → 3662.96] in vitro
[3662.96 → 3663.90] or creating
[3663.90 → 3664.98] embryos,
[3665.00 → 3665.38] they're not
[3665.38 → 3666.12] going to do
[3666.12 → 3666.88] mostly like
[3666.88 → 3667.24] two.
[3667.72 → 3668.12] They're going
[3668.12 → 3668.60] to make like
[3668.60 → 3669.40] six or eight
[3669.40 → 3669.90] or ten
[3669.90 → 3670.54] or twelve.
[3670.70 → 3671.16] And so,
[3671.62 → 3672.44] we very early
[3672.44 → 3673.14] in our fertility
[3673.14 → 3673.84] journey said
[3673.84 → 3675.08] whichever embryos
[3675.08 → 3675.90] we are able
[3675.90 → 3677.02] to have,
[3677.54 → 3678.46] we're committed
[3678.46 → 3678.94] to each and
[3678.94 → 3679.52] every one of
[3679.52 → 3679.72] them,
[3679.86 → 3680.42] even if that
[3680.42 → 3680.78] means our
[3680.78 → 3681.24] family is
[3681.24 → 3682.28] ridiculously large.
[3682.90 → 3683.02] And so,
[3683.06 → 3683.46] that was the
[3683.46 → 3684.06] big step of
[3684.06 → 3684.56] faith too
[3684.56 → 3685.60] because there's
[3685.60 → 3686.80] often,
[3687.22 → 3687.44] I mean,
[3687.44 → 3688.08] and we've
[3688.08 → 3688.36] heard of
[3688.36 → 3688.76] lots of
[3688.76 → 3689.34] couples who
[3689.34 → 3690.48] they do
[3690.48 → 3691.12] in vitro,
[3691.66 → 3692.36] they have
[3692.36 → 3692.74] their two
[3692.74 → 3693.30] kids and
[3693.30 → 3693.56] they don't
[3693.56 → 3693.90] really know
[3693.90 → 3694.42] what to do
[3694.42 → 3694.74] with the
[3694.74 → 3695.22] six or eight
[3695.22 → 3695.88] embryos that
[3695.88 → 3696.34] are left.
[3697.06 → 3697.70] And some
[3697.70 → 3698.14] of those
[3698.14 → 3699.18] issues become
[3699.18 → 3700.66] theological
[3700.66 → 3701.46] issues and
[3701.46 → 3702.14] ethical issues
[3702.14 → 3702.62] as to what
[3702.62 → 3703.14] you do with
[3703.14 → 3703.60] all of those
[3703.60 → 3704.48] embryos afterwards.
[3705.66 → 3706.38] There's not
[3706.38 → 3706.90] a ton,
[3707.06 → 3707.22] well,
[3707.28 → 3707.58] there are
[3707.58 → 3708.40] options,
[3708.82 → 3710.38] you know,
[3710.42 → 3711.02] so your options
[3711.02 → 3712.26] after you
[3712.26 → 3712.66] create an
[3712.66 → 3713.26] embryo is of
[3713.26 → 3713.74] course to
[3713.74 → 3714.64] transfer them
[3714.64 → 3715.48] and pray that
[3715.48 → 3716.08] they continue
[3716.08 → 3716.52] to grow.
[3717.44 → 3718.26] in utero,
[3718.66 → 3719.12] you can
[3719.12 → 3719.52] donate them
[3719.52 → 3720.10] to science,
[3720.20 → 3720.62] which is,
[3721.04 → 3721.58] as most
[3721.58 → 3722.14] Christians I
[3722.14 → 3722.44] think would
[3722.44 → 3723.18] agree that if
[3723.18 → 3723.70] life begins
[3723.70 → 3724.30] at conception,
[3724.52 → 3725.34] that's not a
[3725.34 → 3726.08] viable option.
[3726.86 → 3727.92] And then a
[3727.92 → 3728.88] newer option in
[3728.88 → 3729.76] Canada particularly
[3729.76 → 3730.62] is embryo
[3730.62 → 3731.02] adoption.
[3731.90 → 3732.68] There's something
[3732.68 → 3733.60] like over
[3733.60 → 3735.20] 700,000 frozen
[3735.20 → 3735.90] embryos in the
[3735.90 → 3736.46] United States
[3736.46 → 3736.98] and Canada.
[3737.70 → 3738.06] And if you
[3738.06 → 3738.94] consider all of
[3738.94 → 3739.82] those individual
[3739.82 → 3741.68] lives that God
[3741.68 → 3742.32] has created,
[3743.02 → 3744.12] there's a huge
[3744.12 → 3745.20] sort of moral
[3745.20 → 3746.16] dilemma that us
[3746.16 → 3746.62] as Christians
[3746.62 → 3747.10] face.
[3747.10 → 3748.18] as to how we
[3748.18 → 3748.68] can help to
[3748.68 → 3749.12] address that
[3749.12 → 3749.44] problem.
[3750.06 → 3750.72] And that's
[3750.72 → 3751.08] something that
[3751.08 → 3751.64] we feel really
[3751.64 → 3752.80] privileged to
[3752.80 → 3753.66] have experienced
[3753.66 → 3755.28] an embryo
[3755.28 → 3755.72] adoption.
[3757.16 → 3758.10] Our youngest
[3758.10 → 3760.26] son's genetic
[3760.26 → 3761.48] family chose us
[3761.48 → 3763.20] as their adoptive
[3763.20 → 3764.22] family and they
[3764.22 → 3764.88] gave us five
[3764.88 → 3765.42] embryos,
[3765.46 → 3766.16] which we were
[3766.16 → 3767.34] unbelievably
[3767.34 → 3768.44] grateful for.
[3768.96 → 3770.24] And we were
[3770.24 → 3771.20] able to have
[3771.20 → 3771.96] one son from
[3771.96 → 3772.26] that,
[3772.50 → 3773.20] from those five
[3773.20 → 3773.88] embryos and we
[3773.88 → 3774.48] lost the other
[3774.48 → 3774.88] four.
[3774.88 → 3775.88] four babies
[3775.88 → 3776.46] and which I
[3776.46 → 3776.84] still,
[3777.08 → 3777.72] in some ways,
[3778.14 → 3778.90] that was also
[3778.90 → 3779.32] really,
[3779.84 → 3780.76] really,
[3780.84 → 3781.72] really difficult to
[3781.72 → 3782.50] lose those four
[3782.50 → 3783.46] babies because they
[3783.46 → 3784.08] were my babies
[3784.08 → 3784.46] already,
[3784.76 → 3786.16] even though genetically
[3786.16 → 3788.22] they belonged to
[3788.22 → 3790.98] another family.
[3790.98 → 3792.90] so that's a huge
[3792.90 → 3793.98] question that I think
[3793.98 → 3795.20] every couple who is
[3795.20 → 3797.08] facing infertility and
[3797.08 → 3798.62] moving towards some
[3798.62 → 3799.14] of the medical
[3799.14 → 3800.72] interventions that are
[3800.72 → 3801.10] available,
[3801.90 → 3803.00] to think really
[3803.00 → 3804.18] carefully about each
[3804.18 → 3805.52] of those things and
[3805.52 → 3806.60] what they look like to
[3806.60 → 3807.68] you and what you can
[3807.68 → 3808.62] envision in your future
[3808.62 → 3809.42] and what God's called
[3809.42 → 3809.92] you to do.
[3809.92 → 3812.20] We have another set of
[3812.20 → 3813.86] friends too who said,
[3813.96 → 3814.60] we can't commit to
[3814.60 → 3815.50] eight embryos or ten
[3815.50 → 3816.00] embryos,
[3816.12 → 3817.24] please only make two.
[3817.88 → 3819.08] And they knew that if
[3819.08 → 3819.96] they only made two,
[3820.62 → 3821.58] then those are the only
[3821.58 → 3822.72] two chances that they
[3822.72 → 3823.32] would have.
[3823.90 → 3825.52] And so that's a
[3825.52 → 3826.74] sacrifice in some ways
[3826.74 → 3828.08] too because it's a
[3828.08 → 3828.42] long,
[3828.92 → 3829.40] prolonged
[3829.40 → 3832.34] ordeal to go through
[3832.34 → 3833.46] the preparation
[3833.46 → 3835.58] to get an embryo
[3835.58 → 3836.30] and to transfer.
[3836.30 → 3838.10] So yeah,
[3838.10 → 3838.98] there are lots of issues
[3838.98 → 3839.78] to think about and to
[3839.78 → 3840.48] pray about and to
[3840.48 → 3841.30] seek wisdom on,
[3841.54 → 3842.80] both from people who
[3842.80 → 3844.24] are wiser than you
[3844.24 → 3845.32] and maybe more
[3845.32 → 3845.92] experienced,
[3846.42 → 3847.46] but also your doctors
[3847.46 → 3848.94] and nurses and maybe
[3848.94 → 3849.76] other people who've
[3849.76 → 3850.90] gone through it also.
[3852.18 → 3853.36] The advice for that
[3853.36 → 3854.04] would be to think
[3854.04 → 3855.48] about those things
[3855.48 → 3857.40] beforehand rather than
[3857.40 → 3858.48] at the moment because
[3858.48 → 3859.96] it's harder to make
[3859.96 → 3861.00] those decisions in the
[3861.00 → 3862.80] moment than if you
[3862.80 → 3864.12] have decided that
[3864.12 → 3864.48] already.
[3864.48 → 3866.68] what are some
[3866.68 → 3868.08] emotional issues that
[3868.08 → 3869.32] we wrestled with
[3869.32 → 3871.08] together?
[3871.62 → 3872.38] Do you have any
[3872.38 → 3873.40] advice on how to do
[3873.40 → 3873.72] that?
[3875.18 → 3876.88] Fertility issues are
[3876.88 → 3877.72] really tough on
[3877.72 → 3878.16] marriage.
[3879.28 → 3880.38] I think that we all
[3880.38 → 3881.44] just assume that if
[3881.44 → 3882.04] we want children,
[3882.16 → 3882.76] we'll get children.
[3883.28 → 3883.92] And we don't think
[3883.92 → 3885.30] about oftentimes it
[3885.30 → 3886.14] doesn't go as smoothly
[3886.14 → 3886.68] as that.
[3886.78 → 3887.74] Sometimes it just takes
[3887.74 → 3888.50] a long time to get
[3888.50 → 3889.24] pregnant naturally.
[3890.02 → 3891.04] And if you end up
[3891.04 → 3891.84] having to do some
[3891.84 → 3892.70] fertility stuff,
[3892.70 → 3895.06] every appointment
[3895.06 → 3895.84] takes forever.
[3896.22 → 3896.94] And then there's so
[3896.94 → 3897.98] many steps to get to
[3897.98 → 3898.70] the point where you
[3898.70 → 3899.54] need to be at.
[3900.10 → 3900.90] Sometimes your body
[3900.90 → 3902.02] doesn't cooperate or
[3902.02 → 3903.14] sometimes your schedule
[3903.14 → 3905.04] doesn't coincide with
[3905.04 → 3905.72] the schedule of the
[3905.72 → 3906.74] doctor's offices or the
[3906.74 → 3907.56] hospitals or whoever
[3907.56 → 3908.06] you need to be
[3908.06 → 3908.64] connected to.
[3909.06 → 3909.92] So for me,
[3909.98 → 3910.90] an emotional issue
[3910.90 → 3911.98] that I faced was
[3911.98 → 3912.24] one,
[3912.30 → 3913.52] I was angry.
[3913.80 → 3914.62] I couldn't understand
[3914.62 → 3915.62] why God would deny
[3915.62 → 3917.70] me the honour and
[3917.70 → 3918.60] privilege of being a
[3918.60 → 3918.82] mom.
[3918.82 → 3920.68] I feel like I had
[3920.68 → 3921.96] given up so much to
[3921.96 → 3923.40] follow God and to
[3923.40 → 3925.62] try to complete his
[3925.62 → 3926.48] will for my life.
[3926.56 → 3926.86] And I couldn't
[3926.86 → 3927.50] understand why he
[3927.50 → 3929.44] wouldn't give me a
[3929.44 → 3929.78] baby.
[3930.42 → 3930.82] And I mean,
[3930.88 → 3931.72] this is like a long,
[3931.80 → 3931.96] I mean,
[3932.00 → 3933.12] my oldest kid is 12
[3933.12 → 3933.84] now, and it still
[3933.84 → 3934.86] brings me to tears
[3934.86 → 3937.48] to think about why
[3937.48 → 3939.16] would God do this to
[3939.16 → 3939.46] me?
[3939.66 → 3939.98] Right?
[3940.06 → 3941.10] And I look back and
[3941.10 → 3942.22] God didn't do this to
[3942.22 → 3942.44] me.
[3942.74 → 3943.76] God allowed me to go
[3943.76 → 3945.50] through these struggles
[3945.50 → 3947.88] to understand his
[3947.88 → 3948.58] love for me,
[3948.78 → 3949.90] to be able to parent
[3949.90 → 3953.12] a child that I would
[3953.12 → 3954.32] never otherwise have
[3954.32 → 3955.12] been able to parent
[3955.12 → 3957.06] and to love all three
[3957.06 → 3957.64] of my kids,
[3957.98 → 3958.38] you know?
[3959.86 → 3961.36] So I was angry for a
[3961.36 → 3963.00] long time and I
[3963.00 → 3963.88] actually wasn't angry
[3963.88 → 3965.02] at Josh,
[3965.70 → 3966.86] but I was angry at
[3966.86 → 3967.76] God for a long time.
[3969.08 → 3970.14] And then the other
[3970.14 → 3972.50] sort of emotional issue
[3972.50 → 3973.72] is just that sense of,
[3974.30 → 3974.36] well,
[3974.36 → 3974.64] one,
[3974.70 → 3975.24] impatience,
[3975.36 → 3975.80] but two,
[3975.88 → 3976.56] just loss.
[3976.66 → 3978.76] I desired to be
[3978.76 → 3979.14] pregnant.
[3979.70 → 3980.56] Lots of my girlfriends
[3980.56 → 3981.64] were pregnant and they
[3981.64 → 3982.62] were all just having
[3982.62 → 3983.80] babies, and it seemed so
[3983.80 → 3984.12] easy.
[3984.76 → 3985.12] And again,
[3985.12 → 3986.12] I was kind of angry
[3986.12 → 3988.10] and just sad and
[3988.10 → 3989.16] grieving about that.
[3990.38 → 3990.94] Thankfully,
[3991.28 → 3992.76] God has allowed me to
[3992.76 → 3993.94] be pregnant twice with
[3993.94 → 3996.88] two healthy fat baby
[3996.88 → 3998.02] boys and really
[3998.02 → 3999.10] excellent pregnancies.
[3999.72 → 4000.88] So I'm so thankful for
[4000.88 → 4001.80] that honour and
[4001.80 → 4004.74] pregnancy is not always
[4004.74 → 4005.36] easy either,
[4005.48 → 4008.24] but it was just a joy
[4008.24 → 4008.92] to be able to
[4008.92 → 4009.80] experience that.
[4011.30 → 4012.40] So both of those
[4012.40 → 4013.46] things emotionally were
[4013.46 → 4014.38] really tough for me.
[4014.70 → 4015.90] The other thing that I
[4015.90 → 4017.66] think is interesting is
[4017.66 → 4019.28] men and women tend to
[4019.28 → 4020.24] deal with those kinds of
[4020.24 → 4020.86] things differently.
[4021.14 → 4022.66] So I wanted to talk
[4022.66 → 4023.64] about it all the time
[4023.64 → 4024.30] with whoever would
[4024.30 → 4024.68] listen.
[4025.02 → 4025.76] That's not true,
[4025.82 → 4026.52] but I wanted to talk
[4026.52 → 4027.58] about it with Josh a lot
[4027.58 → 4029.42] and Josh didn't want
[4029.42 → 4030.10] to talk about it all
[4030.10 → 4030.52] the time.
[4030.52 → 4030.96] Right.
[4031.02 → 4031.98] And so that's just a
[4031.98 → 4033.68] difference between the
[4033.68 → 4034.40] two of us.
[4034.40 → 4035.46] And sometimes it was
[4035.46 → 4037.78] really hard to find a
[4037.78 → 4040.40] good balance and also
[4040.40 → 4041.52] set our priorities in
[4041.52 → 4044.48] our marriage to that
[4044.48 → 4045.56] having children wasn't
[4045.56 → 4046.44] going to define us
[4046.44 → 4047.30] having or having not
[4047.30 → 4048.32] having children wasn't
[4048.32 → 4050.54] going to define us that
[4050.54 → 4052.50] we were placed here for
[4052.50 → 4053.40] a greater purpose than
[4053.40 → 4054.62] just to parent kids.
[4054.62 → 4054.96] Right.
[4055.00 → 4055.62] And that was a really
[4055.62 → 4059.22] hard sort of issue to
[4059.22 → 4060.22] work through to
[4060.22 → 4061.14] realize that if I didn't
[4061.14 → 4062.40] ever have children that I
[4062.40 → 4063.28] wasn't any less of a
[4063.28 → 4064.90] person or less of a
[4064.90 → 4066.48] woman or less of a
[4066.48 → 4066.82] wife.
[4067.34 → 4068.50] It just was going to be
[4068.50 → 4069.24] something different for
[4069.24 → 4069.48] me.
[4069.98 → 4071.10] So that was something to
[4071.10 → 4072.76] think about too for us as
[4072.76 → 4073.88] we worked through all of
[4073.88 → 4074.14] that.
[4075.26 → 4077.98] Yeah, I think if you
[4077.98 → 4079.12] know, there's a normal
[4079.12 → 4081.54] experiences of jealousy,
[4082.40 → 4084.02] maybe I wouldn't put it
[4084.02 → 4085.08] as strongly as that.
[4085.22 → 4086.44] But, you know, the
[4086.44 → 4088.02] really hard, the hardest
[4088.02 → 4089.46] part for me was when
[4089.46 → 4091.00] good, good friends of
[4091.00 → 4092.14] ours would be pregnant
[4092.14 → 4093.10] and they wouldn't want
[4093.10 → 4094.70] to tell us because they
[4094.70 → 4095.34] knew we struggled.
[4095.54 → 4098.04] And so and then you go
[4098.04 → 4098.94] through these strange
[4098.94 → 4100.10] things where you want to
[4100.10 → 4101.84] be happy for someone, but
[4101.84 → 4102.76] it hurts at the same
[4102.76 → 4103.32] time.
[4103.78 → 4105.14] And they want to share,
[4105.32 → 4106.08] but they know it's going
[4106.08 → 4106.74] to hurt you.
[4106.96 → 4109.18] And it's just a weird, it's
[4109.18 → 4110.08] a weird time.
[4110.08 → 4113.02] So I think that that's a
[4113.02 → 4113.56] big thing.
[4114.46 → 4116.18] Those kinds of emotions.
[4117.88 → 4120.04] Yeah, the great sadness
[4120.04 → 4124.00] at not being able to
[4124.00 → 4125.98] fulfill the desire that
[4125.98 → 4128.16] each other have in terms
[4128.16 → 4129.36] of children.
[4129.36 → 4131.18] that's a that's a real hard
[4131.18 → 4132.46] thing to do or to
[4132.46 → 4133.20] experience.
[4134.24 → 4135.40] And I and I totally
[4135.40 → 4136.28] understand.
[4136.68 → 4136.84] Wow.
[4137.14 → 4139.42] I mean, I know of people
[4139.42 → 4141.18] who have separated their
[4141.18 → 4142.18] marriage dissolved over
[4142.18 → 4144.34] fertility issues and people
[4144.34 → 4145.56] can't believe it.
[4145.78 → 4147.92] But I understand that it's
[4147.92 → 4148.74] really difficult.
[4149.68 → 4150.88] It's a constant.
[4150.98 → 4152.50] It's constantly there between
[4152.50 → 4153.26] the two of you.
[4153.26 → 4157.02] So what advice do you
[4157.02 → 4158.70] have for this is just to
[4158.70 → 4160.24] I think, you know, know
[4160.24 → 4162.34] know that these are not
[4162.34 → 4165.20] feelings that no one else
[4165.20 → 4166.60] has experienced and
[4166.60 → 4170.24] yeah, be able to talk
[4170.24 → 4171.14] about it with somebody.
[4172.08 → 4173.42] Maybe not all the time,
[4174.24 → 4176.14] but, you know, and
[4176.14 → 4178.46] and persevere, be committed
[4178.46 → 4179.68] to one another through it.
[4180.06 → 4181.62] As difficult as it is.
[4181.62 → 4184.48] I mean, ultimately, we
[4184.48 → 4185.26] knew that we were on the
[4185.26 → 4186.32] same team, and we desired
[4186.32 → 4187.18] the same thing.
[4189.04 → 4191.04] And I mean, we look back
[4191.04 → 4192.18] now, and I know that we're
[4192.18 → 4194.30] on the other side, but we
[4194.30 → 4195.60] look back at the years that
[4195.60 → 4197.22] we spent just the two of us
[4197.22 → 4199.04] childless, and we had some
[4199.04 → 4201.28] really great experiences and
[4201.28 → 4202.44] some great travelling.
[4203.22 → 4203.34] Right.
[4203.40 → 4205.82] And so that was always kind of
[4205.82 → 4207.30] in the background for us.
[4207.88 → 4209.42] But we didn't waste those
[4209.42 → 4211.52] years simply being angry
[4211.52 → 4213.84] at each other or pining
[4213.84 → 4214.92] away for something that we
[4214.92 → 4216.26] didn't know if it was ever
[4216.26 → 4216.90] going to happen.
[4217.06 → 4219.44] And so I feel if I look
[4219.44 → 4220.48] back now, I'm really
[4220.48 → 4221.36] thankful for those years
[4221.36 → 4224.18] that we spent before we
[4224.18 → 4224.86] had kids.
[4225.08 → 4226.78] And we really I think our
[4226.78 → 4227.32] marriage was really
[4227.32 → 4228.30] strengthened during those
[4228.30 → 4229.32] times, even though it was
[4229.32 → 4230.30] really, really difficult.
[4232.70 → 4234.32] Josh mentioned sort of the
[4234.32 → 4235.52] idea of talking to people
[4235.52 → 4236.08] about it.
[4236.08 → 4239.58] I think that you can't say
[4239.58 → 4239.96] for you.
[4240.04 → 4241.34] For me personally, I needed
[4241.34 → 4242.74] to choose sort of a small
[4242.74 → 4243.64] community of women,
[4243.74 → 4245.52] particularly to come around
[4245.52 → 4246.76] me and to support me and
[4246.76 → 4247.38] pray for me.
[4248.18 → 4249.86] But also those women knew
[4249.86 → 4250.96] they couldn't just ask me
[4250.96 → 4252.58] out of the blue, you know,
[4252.64 → 4254.04] how is it going with all of
[4254.04 → 4254.42] this?
[4254.54 → 4254.76] Right.
[4254.82 → 4255.92] So they knew that I would
[4255.92 → 4257.06] might approach them at any
[4257.06 → 4258.96] given time, but I could
[4258.96 → 4260.12] trust them enough not to bring
[4260.12 → 4261.16] it up at every single
[4261.16 → 4262.28] opportunity, too.
[4262.28 → 4264.30] So they were very and those
[4264.30 → 4265.60] those women actually changed
[4265.60 → 4266.76] over the years depending on
[4266.76 → 4268.70] where we were living and
[4268.70 → 4272.26] our sort of connection to
[4272.26 → 4273.62] each other at that
[4273.62 → 4274.36] point in time.
[4275.04 → 4277.04] But for me, it was definitely
[4277.04 → 4278.32] a small group of women that
[4278.32 → 4279.62] I could trust that would just
[4279.62 → 4280.70] pray for me anywhere.
[4281.36 → 4282.76] I remember sitting in the
[4282.76 → 4284.44] aisles of a bookstore in front
[4284.44 → 4287.44] of the law section and my
[4287.44 → 4288.34] friend was like, let me just
[4288.34 → 4289.34] pray for you right now.
[4289.40 → 4290.56] And we just sat down and we
[4290.56 → 4291.92] prayed and everybody was just
[4291.92 → 4292.88] like they looked down those
[4292.88 → 4293.98] aisles, and they were like, oh,
[4294.12 → 4294.94] and they just kind of like
[4294.94 → 4296.64] made a big, you know, went to
[4296.64 → 4297.24] the next aisle.
[4297.44 → 4299.22] And so that was really, really
[4299.22 → 4300.12] important to me.
[4301.10 → 4302.16] But it doesn't need to be
[4302.16 → 4303.10] shared with the whole world.
[4303.20 → 4304.32] Not everybody needs to know
[4304.32 → 4305.64] why you don't have kids yet.
[4305.98 → 4307.54] And so you just share as you
[4307.54 → 4309.02] feel comfortable, too.
[4309.62 → 4311.80] And also making sure that you
[4311.80 → 4314.18] both feel comfortable sharing
[4314.18 → 4315.22] it is like you can't.
[4315.38 → 4316.34] I mean, as a woman, I would
[4316.34 → 4318.70] or as my personality, probably
[4318.70 → 4320.30] I would probably talk more
[4320.30 → 4321.48] freely with more people.
[4321.48 → 4322.76] But I know that Josh is a
[4322.76 → 4324.72] little bit more private and
[4324.72 → 4326.48] didn't want me to share it
[4326.48 → 4326.94] with everybody.
[4327.08 → 4328.44] So I needed to respect that
[4328.44 → 4331.52] from his perspective also.
[4333.60 → 4334.00] Good.
[4335.00 → 4335.36] Okay.
[4336.56 → 4338.58] Handle questions of faith in
[4338.58 → 4339.36] the midst of the above.
[4339.48 → 4340.66] I think so.
[4341.38 → 4342.76] April already mentioned that,
[4342.90 → 4344.58] but me, too, felt furious
[4344.58 → 4347.68] at God and really struggled
[4347.68 → 4349.30] with that and didn't understand.
[4349.30 → 4352.08] You know, when I tell my faith
[4352.08 → 4353.58] story, I always have verses
[4353.58 → 4354.84] that fit with different
[4354.84 → 4356.40] periods of my life and then
[4356.40 → 4357.90] that were my favourite.
[4358.04 → 4359.58] And I think that Psalm 13
[4359.58 → 4362.08] was the one I kept going back
[4362.08 → 4363.64] to time and time again in that
[4363.64 → 4363.90] time.
[4363.98 → 4365.42] Like, how long, oh Lord?
[4366.08 → 4367.48] Will you forget me forever?
[4367.70 → 4369.14] This sort of things.
[4369.34 → 4370.88] And that the Psalms of Lament,
[4371.00 → 4373.12] I could really pray in those times.
[4373.12 → 4377.10] But I also know that despite my
[4377.10 → 4381.24] disposition, so that God still
[4381.24 → 4383.54] loved me even though I didn't
[4383.54 → 4386.62] feel it the same way, or he wasn't
[4386.62 → 4388.24] fulfilling my every demand.
[4389.94 → 4394.54] And so I think that, well, first of
[4394.54 → 4397.10] all, I know that I have people
[4397.10 → 4399.80] praying for me and on behalf of me,
[4399.92 → 4401.86] sort of bringing me before the throne
[4401.86 → 4403.10] of God in April, before the throne
[4403.10 → 4405.52] of God, even when I couldn't do
[4405.52 → 4406.26] that myself.
[4406.52 → 4409.26] And I also know that when I look
[4409.26 → 4411.26] back, and this wouldn't have been
[4411.26 → 4413.40] helpful at the moment to say,
[4413.50 → 4415.10] but when I look back, I see that God
[4415.10 → 4417.30] used that in tremendous ways to make
[4417.30 → 4423.84] me a better person, to strengthen
[4423.84 → 4424.18] my faith.
[4424.18 → 4425.48] It's a test of faith, right?
[4425.48 → 4429.54] I need an opportunity for faith to be
[4429.54 → 4430.94] stretched and grow.
[4431.92 → 4435.78] So I, in some ways, as much as it still,
[4435.94 → 4439.04] even still, fertility still, infertility
[4439.04 → 4439.68] still hurts.
[4440.84 → 4444.34] In some ways, I know that I wouldn't be
[4444.34 → 4446.72] anywhere near the same person as I was
[4446.72 → 4447.44] before.
[4447.44 → 4449.76] So God uses it.
[4453.90 → 4455.84] But in the time, didn't think that,
[4456.18 → 4457.48] didn't think it was very good at all.
[4457.88 → 4461.84] So, yeah, I don't know.
[4462.40 → 4463.54] That's, I'll cover that one.
[4464.38 → 4467.14] So then, what role does the community
[4467.14 → 4469.30] of faith play for people struggling
[4469.30 → 4470.60] with fertility issues?
[4471.04 → 4473.20] Give practical advice to help us be
[4473.20 → 4473.76] better than that.
[4473.76 → 4477.94] So I think that fertility issues naturally
[4477.94 → 4482.56] tend to make us more introverted with
[4482.56 → 4483.76] it or private with it.
[4483.90 → 4486.92] Because we are talking about sex and we
[4486.92 → 4488.86] are talking about the ability to have a
[4488.86 → 4489.20] baby.
[4489.84 → 4493.64] And, you know, that's kind of a private
[4493.64 → 4494.52] and personal thing.
[4494.62 → 4497.16] And so you tend to sort of circle the
[4497.16 → 4498.60] wagons and keep it close.
[4499.34 → 4500.54] And then you don't share.
[4500.64 → 4502.40] And then the only people that you have
[4502.40 → 4505.70] to process all your emotions with are
[4505.70 → 4506.28] each other.
[4506.52 → 4509.84] And sometimes, you know, one partner
[4509.84 → 4511.78] might not want to hear it as often or
[4511.78 → 4514.02] just think about it differently or
[4514.02 → 4514.38] whatever.
[4515.04 → 4517.02] So the community of faith for us was so
[4517.02 → 4517.26] important.
[4517.36 → 4520.22] I said earlier that we decided that we
[4520.22 → 4522.80] would be open and share and have that
[4522.80 → 4523.12] freedom.
[4523.68 → 4526.90] We did a testimony in our church in the
[4526.90 → 4527.56] midst of it.
[4527.56 → 4533.86] But I was, yeah, and we, so we had lots
[4533.86 → 4535.40] of people praying for us and lots of
[4535.40 → 4536.54] people knowing about it.
[4536.94 → 4540.94] And, and our closest friends all knew
[4540.94 → 4542.28] about it and were praying for us.
[4542.42 → 4544.14] And, and I tell you though, when, when
[4544.14 → 4546.08] God answered our prayers and our
[4546.08 → 4547.94] daughter, we adopted our daughter, we
[4547.94 → 4550.80] had so many people who were so excited
[4550.80 → 4553.26] because they all recognized that it was
[4553.26 → 4555.10] an answer to so many prayers.
[4555.10 → 4558.58] Um, so I, you know, without the
[4558.58 → 4560.92] community of faith, I don't know that
[4560.92 → 4562.36] we would have made it.
[4562.96 → 4565.32] Uh, we, I don't know that we would have
[4565.32 → 4566.02] stayed the course.
[4566.10 → 4568.08] I, I think it would have been too hard
[4568.08 → 4571.28] without the encouraging words and, and,
[4571.40 → 4573.40] and cards and prayers and all those
[4573.40 → 4573.82] things.
[4574.96 → 4576.44] Um, so I don't know.
[4576.50 → 4577.24] What do you think about you?
[4577.76 → 4578.40] You agree with that?
[4578.74 → 4578.96] Yeah.
[4578.96 → 4581.16] I mean, after we brought Kaylin home,
[4581.76 → 4585.24] um, I received, we received, uh, gifts
[4585.24 → 4587.46] from people we didn't even know, um,
[4587.52 → 4590.84] that, that were so excited that we had
[4590.84 → 4593.18] finally gotten a baby and, you know,
[4593.20 → 4594.60] and of course she was the most beautiful
[4594.60 → 4595.74] baby you'd ever seen.
[4595.74 → 4596.74] So of course.
[4596.74 → 4597.06] Right.
[4597.52 → 4599.38] Um, but no, it was just such, and I
[4599.38 → 4602.74] mean, I remember goodness, um, a baby
[4602.74 → 4605.06] shower in which I owned zero pink
[4605.06 → 4605.54] clothing.
[4605.54 → 4607.28] And after that baby shower and after
[4607.28 → 4608.58] all the gifts came in the mail, I had
[4608.58 → 4610.92] an entire closet full of pink things.
[4611.34 → 4613.16] Um, and I just couldn't even fathom
[4613.16 → 4614.44] that, so many people loved and cared
[4614.44 → 4614.98] for us.
[4615.32 → 4617.00] Um, and that our, I think that our
[4617.00 → 4619.04] story just spoke to so many people and
[4619.04 → 4621.62] it was, um, just really, really amazing.
[4622.30 → 4624.86] Um, I think some practical advice for,
[4625.00 → 4626.62] for people who are maybe trying to
[4626.62 → 4630.00] support or who are wondering is wait
[4630.00 → 4633.48] for the conversation to open, um, a
[4633.48 → 4637.38] little bit, but also don't be super
[4637.38 → 4638.24] shy about it.
[4638.30 → 4638.64] I don't know.
[4638.64 → 4640.06] That's not very good advice, but I
[4640.06 → 4641.28] mean, don't walk up to somebody and
[4641.28 → 4642.22] be like, you guys have been married
[4642.22 → 4642.94] two years.
[4642.94 → 4644.16] Are you going to have a baby soon?
[4644.40 → 4644.76] Right?
[4644.78 → 4645.86] Like that is not helpful.
[4645.86 → 4648.00] And I came up with a lot of really,
[4648.00 → 4650.48] um, sarcastic answers for those folks.
[4650.96 → 4653.12] Um, but you know, you can, you know,
[4653.18 → 4655.16] it's okay to ask questions, and it's
[4655.16 → 4656.40] okay to say, you know what, I'm just
[4656.40 → 4657.12] praying for you guys.
[4657.12 → 4658.88] I know often you're trying to have a
[4658.88 → 4660.88] baby within the first, you know, five
[4660.88 → 4662.36] years or seven years of being
[4662.36 → 4663.84] married and if that's not happening,
[4664.04 → 4666.70] um, it's maybe okay to say, you know,
[4666.72 → 4667.64] I'm just praying for you guys.
[4667.72 → 4669.06] I know that, you know, being married
[4669.06 → 4670.90] is tough because being married with
[4670.90 → 4673.74] or without kids is, is a journey in
[4673.74 → 4674.10] itself.
[4674.10 → 4674.42] Right.
[4674.48 → 4678.30] And so, um, but be, be sensitive to
[4678.30 → 4680.06] those questions and also give space.
[4680.10 → 4682.44] I know that for a long time, um, I
[4682.44 → 4684.20] didn't go to church on Mother's Day.
[4684.20 → 4686.56] I didn't go to church baby showers.
[4686.56 → 4691.00] Um, I, I kind of like just even
[4691.00 → 4693.08] baptisms were really difficult for a
[4693.08 → 4693.38] while.
[4693.38 → 4694.76] And so I just stepped back.
[4695.22 → 4697.08] Um, so you might just be aware if
[4697.08 → 4698.82] there are women and men in your life who
[4698.82 → 4700.30] are kind of stepping back from some of
[4700.30 → 4702.14] those sorts of events that maybe you
[4702.14 → 4703.96] just start praying for them and, and
[4703.96 → 4705.76] then maybe a conversation or a comment
[4705.76 → 4707.74] will come up in conversation with them.
[4707.74 → 4708.82] And then you can say, you know, I've
[4708.82 → 4709.56] been praying for you.
[4709.92 → 4712.36] Um, and that will go a long ways, I think.
[4712.36 → 4715.18] Um, but be graceful and be patient.
[4715.44 → 4717.24] Um, and like Josh said, it's a super
[4717.24 → 4718.08] private issue.
[4718.62 → 4720.62] Um, you don't want to be discussing the
[4720.62 → 4722.10] inner workings of your body with just
[4722.10 → 4723.28] anybody and everybody.
[4724.02 → 4726.62] Um, and it's not somewhere you don't want
[4726.62 → 4728.24] to talk about it, like in the fellowship
[4728.24 → 4729.80] hall after church or at the grocery
[4729.80 → 4732.08] store or on the soccer field or something
[4732.08 → 4732.84] like that either.
[4733.10 → 4735.62] Um, so just be kind of be, um, sensitive
[4735.62 → 4736.92] to all of those things.
[4736.92 → 4737.70] I think that's important.
[4737.96 → 4738.14] Yeah.
[4738.20 → 4740.42] I still haven't gone to baby shower at the
[4740.42 → 4742.34] church, but, uh,
[4742.36 → 4745.84] um, I think it's, uh, that's the trouble
[4745.84 → 4748.66] is that when someone is going through
[4748.66 → 4750.02] infertility, they don't want to talk
[4750.02 → 4751.04] about it all the time either.
[4751.18 → 4752.60] And so I think it's okay to say, Hey,
[4753.02 → 4754.28] praying for you when you want to talk
[4754.28 → 4755.14] about it, let me know.
[4755.50 → 4757.60] Um, and, and we can talk about it.
[4758.12 → 4760.86] Um, I, I don't think it's particularly
[4760.86 → 4761.42] helpful.
[4761.42 → 4763.86] And I know people make jokes about couples
[4763.86 → 4766.02] that have been married a couple of years
[4766.02 → 4767.84] and there are no kids, and they start, they
[4767.84 → 4769.74] start making kind of silly remarks and
[4769.74 → 4772.44] stuff and, and it's all in good.
[4773.56 → 4774.56] It's what it is.
[4774.80 → 4777.80] And, and people who are going through
[4777.80 → 4781.78] infertility, maybe they, um, I mean,
[4781.84 → 4785.24] take it as, um, in the best way possible,
[4785.52 → 4786.54] laugh it off, let it go.
[4786.62 → 4788.02] They're not intending to hurt you.
[4788.02 → 4791.38] Um, and for those of us who are inclined
[4791.38 → 4793.36] to make those remarks, maybe think twice
[4793.36 → 4795.32] about that because you don't know, you
[4795.32 → 4796.44] don't know what people are going through
[4796.44 → 4799.60] and, uh, it's not helpful.
[4800.24 → 4805.16] So, um, but the church is so important.
[4805.44 → 4805.98] There we go.
[4806.40 → 4806.70] Yeah.
[4807.22 → 4809.58] So how did your story process?
[4810.86 → 4814.10] So, oh, well, I was going to say, so
[4814.10 → 4818.58] we have a, um, our oldest is adopted, um,
[4818.58 → 4820.24] with a private domestic adoption.
[4820.24 → 4823.10] So her birth mom actually chose us, um,
[4823.10 → 4824.42] which we're so honoured for.
[4824.60 → 4826.92] And we can't imagine what that would
[4826.92 → 4828.12] have been like for her.
[4828.12 → 4830.06] And we always, we always remember her
[4830.06 → 4831.66] particularly on our daughter's birthday.
[4831.66 → 4833.32] And we've been able to talk about it a
[4833.32 → 4834.20] little bit with our daughter.
[4834.72 → 4836.14] Um, so that's been amazing.
[4836.14 → 4839.98] Our second child is the result of, um,
[4840.80 → 4842.90] fertility treatments, um, in vitro.
[4842.90 → 4845.86] Um, we lost a lot of babies before I
[4845.86 → 4846.74] got pregnant with him.
[4847.56 → 4851.46] Um, he's amazing and, uh, interesting
[4851.46 → 4852.42] kid.
[4852.80 → 4854.28] Um, and he's almost 10.
[4855.24 → 4858.40] Um, that was amazing that I think he
[4858.40 → 4860.88] was our eighth embryo, um, out of eight.
[4861.00 → 4862.64] So he was kind of our last chance.
[4862.64 → 4863.66] So that was pretty amazing.
[4863.66 → 4865.08] And then Lucas is our youngest.
[4865.24 → 4866.80] So Jude is our middle one.
[4866.86 → 4867.88] And then Lucas is our youngest.
[4867.88 → 4870.86] And, um, his genetic family gave us
[4870.86 → 4872.72] the embryos, and we got pregnant
[4872.72 → 4876.64] really easily, um, with him, um, and had a great pregnancy.
[4876.64 → 4878.10] He's almost six.
[4878.60 → 4885.70] Um, but then we lost the last four embryos and, um, those losses were just as hard as
[4885.70 → 4887.88] any of the losses we had already experienced.
[4888.26 → 4892.22] Um, and I grouped for a long time over those lost babies.
[4892.22 → 4908.48] Um, I do take great hope and great, um, encouragement to know that each of those lost babies, um, I think there's 11 of them that I lost, that we lost, um, that God already, God knows who they are and God's got them.
[4908.48 → 4914.82] And someday, um, when I get to heaven, that I will be able to meet all of those, um, children.
[4915.20 → 4921.44] And so I don't know what that looks like, of course, but, um, I do know that God was with us every step of the way.
[4921.50 → 4922.82] And he continues to be with us.
[4922.82 → 4927.22] And, and we, um, we celebrate adoption stories and fostering stories.
[4927.84 → 4935.04] Um, we actually are fostering parents right now just to come alongside families who are struggling because we know that parenting is difficult.
[4935.04 → 4940.32] Um, and sometimes kids just need a safe place to stay for a while.
[4940.82 → 4943.38] Um, that's been, um, a God thing too.
[4944.24 → 4950.26] Um, yeah, so we, yeah, there are lots of unique challenges, kind of like Pastor Chris said in his questions.
[4950.78 → 4952.74] Um, everybody faces unique challenges.
[4953.28 → 4958.62] Um, I think some of the challenges for us as our kids get bigger would be, will be to further explain their stories.
[4958.94 → 4963.86] I know that our middle son has already asked why he doesn't have any biological brothers and sisters.
[4963.86 → 4972.62] Whereas both of our adopted kids do, um, you know, and, and even just the intricacies of embryo adoption is a bit tricky.
[4972.62 → 4976.58] And, and, you know, we'll teach a little bit more as, as they get older.
[4977.08 → 4986.84] Um, my kids, our kids, um, don't look like each other, but they very clearly belong to each other as brothers and sisters, sister.
[4987.32 → 4989.62] Um, which is really, again, a gift from God.
[4990.14 → 4993.84] Um, yeah, so lots of challenges, but so many joys.
[4994.50 → 4999.40] Um, and we don't, um, regret any of our decisions.
[5000.14 → 5002.62] Um, and we're really thankful for what God's given to us.
[5003.70 → 5004.02] Mm-hmm.
[5005.72 → 5006.14] Yep.
[5006.28 → 5014.02] I think, uh, so, yeah, we are just blessed with these three kids that look nothing like each other.
[5014.02 → 5017.26] And, um, I mean, different races as well.
[5017.50 → 5026.60] And, uh, we're blessed to live in a place where, um, that hasn't been such a problem or, or concern.
[5026.60 → 5035.00] And I think, um, but we're just like, uh, in, uh, other families.
[5035.00 → 5039.14] We're raising these children who struggle with total depravity, and they don't listen.
[5039.14 → 5045.86] And, uh, but it's, it's, uh, it's the joy of being a family together.
[5047.10 → 5049.88] Um, so, yeah, that's it.
[5049.88 → 5058.10] Um, we are, one of the things that April and I have been pretty open with and, uh, well, we're open with our story.
[5058.22 → 5063.46] And so we, we're limited for time here probably, but, uh, we, we are open to sharing it.
[5063.46 → 5073.32] And so if you would like someone to talk to or, uh, to pray with you or just to hear our story more, you can call, call us or email us.
[5073.32 → 5074.90] And, uh, we're willing to do that.
[5074.90 → 5078.24] So thanks for listening to us.
[5078.24 → 5095.50] I want to, uh, first, thank Josh and April for, for sharing that with us.
[5095.50 → 5099.22] Uh, and there's a very real chance that they are checking us out online right now.
[5099.22 → 5101.78] So can we thank them by just giving them a round of applause?
[5108.24 → 5115.86] If you would like to connect with Josh and April, you can grab me and I will give you their contact information.
[5116.44 → 5121.46] Um, I'm so grateful for Josh and April's story.
[5121.66 → 5126.88] Uh, in the last couple of days, I've heard this testimony three times as we've put it together.
[5126.88 → 5128.66] And, uh, every time I've heard it, I've cried.
[5129.28 → 5130.82] Uh, and I will never forget.
[5131.50 → 5134.62] There was a time when we were, uh, in seminary together.
[5134.62 → 5140.50] A group of us were in the library and Josh and April had gone back to Ontario to do a fertility treatment.
[5141.18 → 5144.34] Um, and to, to see if a treatment had worked.
[5144.94 → 5148.56] Uh, and Josh found us in the library after the treatment didn't work.
[5148.86 → 5150.80] And he saw us, and he just started weeping.
[5150.92 → 5153.36] And he came over to me, and he says, why does God hate me?
[5155.24 → 5157.10] And we just wept together.
[5158.78 → 5161.60] These emotions are raw, and they are real.
[5161.60 → 5167.22] Uh, and some of us can go through life and circumstance without ever experiencing any of it.
[5167.30 → 5169.16] Without seeing it in the lives of other people.
[5169.92 → 5171.70] And if you are in the midst of that,
[5172.54 → 5174.00] I want you to know
[5174.00 → 5177.24] that we know.
[5178.74 → 5179.84] And that it is real.
[5180.70 → 5181.76] And that you are not alone.
[5183.20 → 5184.10] And so please,
[5185.10 → 5187.46] allow someone,
[5187.46 → 5189.28] doesn't have to be me,
[5189.38 → 5189.98] but I will,
[5190.68 → 5192.08] to journey with you.
[5193.02 → 5195.28] And to share that story together.
[5197.06 → 5198.62] I will never forget the day
[5198.62 → 5200.98] that Josh and April
[5200.98 → 5202.50] told us that
[5202.50 → 5204.84] Kaylin's birth mom had picked them.
[5205.54 → 5206.76] And then four days later,
[5207.46 → 5208.62] four days later,
[5209.00 → 5209.68] Kaylin was born.
[5210.42 → 5211.66] They had four days
[5211.66 → 5213.68] to adjust to this whole reality.
[5213.68 → 5214.72] And then she came
[5214.72 → 5215.94] and she was born
[5215.94 → 5217.44] at like five pounds,
[5217.60 → 5218.26] eleven ounces.
[5218.50 → 5219.40] She was tiny
[5219.40 → 5220.56] and beautiful.
[5221.34 → 5222.66] And we cried all over again.
[5222.92 → 5224.24] This time for a different reason.
[5225.16 → 5225.90] But I also know
[5225.90 → 5226.72] that not every story
[5226.72 → 5227.40] ends that way.
[5228.70 → 5229.46] Not every story
[5229.46 → 5230.42] finishes like that.
[5230.52 → 5230.82] And so,
[5231.60 → 5232.34] wherever you are
[5232.34 → 5233.10] in that story,
[5234.10 → 5235.44] know that you are not alone.
[5235.84 → 5236.58] And we are together.
[5237.90 → 5239.52] Josh also wanted me to say,
[5239.78 → 5240.72] because he didn't get it
[5240.72 → 5241.34] in the
[5241.34 → 5242.24] in the video there,
[5242.24 → 5245.40] that it is so important
[5245.40 → 5246.16] for all of us
[5246.16 → 5247.02] as church members
[5247.02 → 5247.80] to recognize
[5247.80 → 5248.82] and to realize
[5248.82 → 5249.78] and to live
[5249.78 → 5251.10] into the truth of
[5251.10 → 5252.88] that whether we are married
[5252.88 → 5254.04] or single,
[5254.40 → 5255.38] whether we are young
[5255.38 → 5256.40] or old,
[5256.40 → 5257.80] that we are all
[5257.80 → 5258.96] spiritual mothers
[5258.96 → 5259.60] and fathers
[5259.60 → 5260.76] to those kids
[5260.76 → 5261.68] whom we make
[5261.68 → 5262.92] baptismal vows to.
[5264.68 → 5265.34] And so,
[5265.42 → 5266.36] regardless of your journey
[5266.36 → 5267.40] of faith and life,
[5267.78 → 5269.76] you are a spiritual parent
[5269.76 → 5271.80] to those
[5271.80 → 5273.10] whom you have stood
[5273.10 → 5274.06] in front of
[5274.06 → 5275.28] and said,
[5275.80 → 5276.38] do you promise
[5276.38 → 5277.54] to love and support
[5277.54 → 5278.28] this child
[5278.28 → 5279.56] and raise them up
[5279.56 → 5280.70] in the faith
[5280.70 → 5281.80] according to the teachings
[5281.80 → 5282.46] of this church?
[5282.60 → 5283.32] And you said,
[5283.88 → 5284.34] we do,
[5285.04 → 5285.96] God helping us.
[5287.04 → 5287.96] We do,
[5288.92 → 5289.84] God helping us.
[5290.50 → 5291.58] That is who we are.
[5291.72 → 5291.92] Amen?
[5291.92 → 5292.02] Amen?
[5293.34 → 5294.32] Let me pray with you
[5294.32 → 5295.66] and invite the worship team
[5295.66 → 5296.78] to make their way back up.
[5296.78 → 5299.74] Father God,
[5299.80 → 5300.42] we thank you
[5300.42 → 5301.24] for the story
[5301.24 → 5302.50] of Josh and April.
[5303.12 → 5303.58] We thank you
[5303.58 → 5303.98] for the way
[5303.98 → 5305.26] that you have used
[5305.26 → 5305.84] that story
[5305.84 → 5306.54] and have spoken
[5306.54 → 5307.88] into our circumstances
[5307.88 → 5308.78] here and now.
[5309.16 → 5309.74] And we pray,
[5309.92 → 5310.34] Lord God,
[5310.40 → 5311.20] for the men and women
[5311.20 → 5312.98] who are in the midst
[5312.98 → 5315.22] of this journey.
[5316.44 → 5318.00] We pray for the chaoses
[5318.00 → 5319.04] and the crying out,
[5319.14 → 5319.60] how long,
[5319.68 → 5320.06] oh Lord,
[5320.12 → 5321.22] will you forget me forever?
[5322.42 → 5323.94] We pray for the tears
[5323.94 → 5326.58] that spill in sorrow
[5326.58 → 5327.82] and the tears
[5327.82 → 5328.92] that spill in joy.
[5330.36 → 5331.06] And we pray,
[5331.18 → 5331.54] Lord God,
[5331.60 → 5333.22] that we all together
[5333.22 → 5334.30] would remember
[5334.30 → 5336.34] that we are brothers
[5336.34 → 5337.22] and sisters,
[5337.22 → 5339.32] that we are heirs of God
[5339.32 → 5340.70] and co-heirs with Christ
[5340.70 → 5341.60] and that by the power
[5341.60 → 5342.50] of your Holy Spirit
[5342.50 → 5344.06] in our transformation,
[5344.34 → 5346.10] new covenant identity,
[5346.74 → 5349.38] we belong to each other.
[5350.98 → 5352.58] And so even as you promise
[5352.58 → 5353.60] to go with us,
[5353.88 → 5356.24] may we go with each other.
[5356.58 → 5357.62] As ambassadors
[5357.62 → 5359.08] of your reconciliation,
[5359.58 → 5361.60] as signposts
[5361.60 → 5362.86] of the covenant reality
[5362.86 → 5366.00] that you have drawn us into.
[5368.18 → 5369.18] And so, Lord God,
[5369.24 → 5370.48] be near to us now.
[5372.58 → 5374.12] Hold us and hear us,
[5374.22 → 5374.58] we pray,
[5375.04 → 5377.52] in Jesus' name alone.
[5378.60 → 5378.92] Amen.
[5378.92 → 5379.06] Amen.
[5380.36 → 5381.00] Amen.
[5381.00 → 5381.46] Amen.
[5381.46 → 5382.04] Amen.
[5390.22 → 5391.78] Amen.
[5392.46 → 5392.70] Amen.
[5392.70 → 5393.36] Amen.
[5394.22 → 5394.96] Amen.
[5399.10 → 5399.48] Amen.
[5399.48 → 5399.68] Amen.
[5399.74 → 5400.28] Amen.
[5400.28 → 5400.46] Amen.
[5400.52 → 5400.86] Amen.
[5400.86 → 5401.24] Amen.
[5401.48 → 5403.10] Amen.
[5403.10 → 5403.84] Amen.
[5403.84 → 5404.48] Amen.
[5404.48 → 5404.90] Amen.
[5405.04 → 5406.50] Amen.
[5406.50 → 5407.02] Yay.
[5407.06 → 5407.74] Amen.
[5407.74 → 5407.78] Amen.
[5407.78 → 5408.14] Amen.
[5408.14 → 5408.44] Amen.
[5408.44 → 5422.44] brought me
[5427.32 → 5436.44] I'm a child
[5438.44 → 5450.84] has
[5458.84 → 5464.06] time
[5464.28 → 5466.12] me
[5468.44 → 5474.22] I'm a child of God, yes I am.
[5475.22 → 5484.38] In my Father's house, there's a place for me.
[5485.22 → 5492.20] I'm a child of God, yes I am.
[5492.20 → 5502.44] I am chosen, not forsaken, I am who you say I am.
[5503.14 → 5511.44] You are for me, not against me, I am who you say I am.
[5512.24 → 5520.62] I am chosen, not forsaken, I am who you say I am.
[5520.62 → 5530.00] You are for me, not against me, I am who you say I am.
[5530.86 → 5534.62] I am who you say I am.
[5535.62 → 5543.90] Blessed are the sons and free, Holy Spirit indeed.
[5543.90 → 5551.52] I'm a child of God, yes I am.
[5553.28 → 5562.20] In my Father's house, there's a place for me.
[5562.20 → 5570.36] I'm a child of God, yes I am.
[5571.58 → 5580.70] In my Father's house, there's a place for me.
[5580.70 → 5589.68] I'm a child of God, yes I am.
[5592.76 → 5598.30] You may have a seat.
[5598.30 → 5606.22] We're going to come to the table of our Lord.
[5607.36 → 5615.30] Our Lord Jesus instituted this supper when the disciples had gathered to celebrate Passover.
[5616.10 → 5620.32] If you know about the Jewish tradition and the Jewish context of that meal,
[5620.32 → 5623.24] the Passover is a family meal.
[5624.20 → 5628.90] It's an opportunity for a family of multiple generations to come together,
[5629.30 → 5634.32] although with a biological link, and to remember the Exodus.
[5635.34 → 5639.78] The Lord's Supper is also a family meal.
[5640.64 → 5642.52] But our definition of family has changed.
[5642.52 → 5648.78] By the grace of Jesus, our definition of family is not based on our blood or DNA,
[5649.08 → 5651.12] but on Jesus' blood.
[5652.08 → 5655.18] And so we gather together as a church family now
[5655.18 → 5658.02] to come to the table of our Lord Jesus,
[5658.46 → 5661.04] to be welcomed in his presence,
[5661.52 → 5664.88] to have his grace made tasteable,
[5665.68 → 5668.20] that we might hold him in our midst.
[5668.20 → 5673.74] At his last supper, the Lord Jesus took bread,
[5674.40 → 5677.42] and when he had given thanks, he broke it,
[5677.66 → 5678.04] and he said,
[5678.40 → 5680.94] this is my body, which is for you.
[5681.64 → 5684.32] Do this in remembrance of me.
[5686.38 → 5689.66] In the same way, after supper,
[5690.22 → 5692.48] he took the cup and said,
[5692.98 → 5696.46] this cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[5696.46 → 5700.16] Do this in remembrance of me.
[5700.78 → 5703.68] For whenever we eat this bread and drink this cup,
[5703.82 → 5708.88] we proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.
[5710.74 → 5714.18] Therefore, we proclaim our faith
[5714.18 → 5719.70] as signed and sealed in this sacrament.
[5719.70 → 5724.12] Christ has risen.
[5724.88 → 5726.16] Christ will come again.
[5727.78 → 5728.72] Church family,
[5729.56 → 5732.04] the Lord has prepared his table
[5732.04 → 5734.00] for all who love him
[5734.00 → 5737.58] and who trust in him alone for their salvation.
[5737.98 → 5740.04] If you are truly sorry for your sins,
[5740.14 → 5744.60] if you sincerely believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as your Saviour,
[5744.60 → 5747.78] and you desire to live in obedience to him,
[5747.98 → 5749.30] whether you are here, present,
[5749.42 → 5751.38] or participating online,
[5751.58 → 5754.54] you are now invited to come with gladness
[5754.54 → 5756.88] to the table of the Lord.
[5757.96 → 5759.12] The gifts of God
[5759.12 → 5761.74] for the people of God.
[5762.56 → 5763.74] I'd like to invite the elders forward.
[5763.74 → 5768.12] For the people of God
[5768.12 → 5769.12] by the Lord
[5769.12 → 5770.12] Amen.
[5799.12 → 5801.12] Amen.
[5829.12 → 5831.12] Amen.
[5859.12 → 5861.12] Amen.
[5889.12 → 5891.12] Amen.
[5919.12 → 5920.12] Amen.
[5920.12 → 5921.12] Amen.
[5925.14 → 5925.80] Amen.
[5929.80 → 5930.80] Amen.
[5930.80 → 5931.24] Amen.
[5939.24 → 5942.46] The body of Christ given for you.
[5943.06 → 5947.92] And so take, eat, remember and believe that the body of our Lord Jesus Christ was given
[5947.92 → 5951.58] for the complete forgiveness of all our sins.
[5977.92 → 6002.16] Do not wait for me to draw near to you,
[6002.16 → 6006.90] but you put yourself in frail humility.
[6007.92 → 6016.30] Do not wait for me to cry out to you,
[6016.80 → 6022.10] but you let me hear your voice calling me,
[6022.10 → 6028.44] and I'm forever grateful to you.
[6029.66 → 6036.56] I'm forever grateful to the cross,
[6036.56 → 6043.94] I'm forever grateful to you.
[6043.94 → 6073.94] 
[6073.94 → 6082.32] To cry out to you, but you let me hear your voice calling me,
[6082.32 → 6089.70] and I'm forever grateful to you.
[6089.70 → 6098.08] I'm forever grateful to you.
[6098.08 → 6105.46] I'm forever grateful to you.
[6105.46 → 6112.84] I'm forever grateful to you.
[6112.84 → 6121.22] I'm forever grateful to you.
[6121.22 → 6128.22] I'm forever grateful to you.
[6128.22 → 6136.60] I'm forever grateful to you.
[6136.60 → 6147.98] God, you came to seek and save the lost.
[6147.98 → 6155.36] I'm forever grateful to you.
[6155.36 → 6169.36] I'm forever grateful to you,
[6169.36 → 6177.74] God, you're forever grateful to you.
[6177.74 → 6181.86] for the complete forgiveness of all our sins.
[6181.86 → 6195.40] Amen.
[6195.40 → 6199.20] Once again, as you're able, I'm going to invite you to stand.
[6199.20 → 6201.78] We're going to respond in prayer,
[6201.78 → 6206.06] and then we will receive our parting blessing,
[6206.58 → 6208.74] after which we will sing one more song.
[6209.40 → 6210.52] Following our final song,
[6210.64 → 6213.50] everyone is invited to gather in the back for a time of fellowship.
[6213.70 → 6215.12] I encourage you to stick around for that,
[6215.24 → 6217.52] share life and story with each other.
[6217.98 → 6220.58] Perhaps take the vulnerable risk
[6220.58 → 6223.08] of talking to someone you've never talked to before.
[6223.08 → 6227.92] Try someone new in this family that we call church.
[6228.76 → 6230.52] Let's pray together.
[6233.96 → 6239.46] Loving God, we thank you that you have fed us in this sacrament,
[6240.90 → 6244.80] that by it, you have united us with Christ and with each other,
[6245.36 → 6249.34] and that here you have given us a foretaste of the heavenly banquet
[6249.34 → 6252.26] in your eternal kingdom to come.
[6253.08 → 6257.74] Send us out in the power of your spirit to live and to work
[6257.74 → 6263.20] to your praise and glory for the sake of Jesus Christ alone,
[6264.10 → 6265.24] in whose name we pray.
[6266.06 → 6266.46] Amen.
[6268.42 → 6271.86] Standing together, receive the blessing of our God.
[6273.04 → 6275.30] May God go before you to lead you.
[6276.10 → 6278.34] May God go behind you to guard you.
[6278.68 → 6280.94] May God go beneath you to support you.
[6280.94 → 6284.22] And may God go beside you to befriend you.
[6284.58 → 6286.46] Do not be afraid.
[6287.04 → 6289.06] Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[6289.18 → 6290.76] Do not be afraid,
[6291.16 → 6295.78] but go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
[6297.06 → 6297.70] Amen.
[6297.70 → 6316.68] Thank you.
[6316.68 → 6331.90] From everlasting to everlasting you are gone.
[6331.90 → 6347.82] From everlasting to everlasting you are gone.
[6347.82 → 6355.54] In holiness you stand secure through culture shifting sands.
[6355.54 → 6362.36] And change my own amenities of man.
[6363.58 → 6370.22] And as the nations rise and fall your sovereignty remains.
[6370.22 → 6383.22] You are, you are, you are the one true God.
[6385.54 → 6398.30] From everlasting to everlasting you are gone.
[6398.30 → 6413.30] From everlasting to everlasting you are gone.
[6413.30 → 6421.34] In faithfulness your love extends through times of turbulence.
[6421.34 → 6428.54] Adopting those who call upon your name.
[6428.54 → 6436.26] And every generation joins in songs of grateful praise.
[6437.14 → 6449.54] You are, you are, you are the one true God.
[6449.54 → 6463.54] From everlasting to everlasting you are gone.
[6463.54 → 6478.54] Everlasting to everlasting you are gone.
[6478.54 → 6493.54] Eternal, immortal, invisible God.
[6493.54 → 6508.54] Eternal, immortal, invisible God.
[6508.54 → 6514.54] Eternal, immortal, invisible God.
[6514.54 → 6521.54] Eternal, immortal, invisible God.
[6521.54 → 6523.54] God
[6523.54 → 6527.54] eternal
[6527.54 → 6531.54] eternal
[6531.54 → 6535.54] invisible
[6535.54 → 6539.54] God
[6539.54 → 6541.54] You
[6541.54 → 6543.54] are
[6543.54 → 6545.54] God
[6545.54 → 6549.54] You
[6549.54 → 6551.54] are
[6551.54 → 6553.54] God
[6553.54 → 6555.54] You
[6555.54 → 6557.54] are

[6559.54 → 6561.54] You
[6561.54 → 6563.54] are
[6563.54 → 6565.54] God
[6565.54 → 6567.54] You
