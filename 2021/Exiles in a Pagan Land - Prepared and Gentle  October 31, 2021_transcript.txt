[0.00 --> 16.16]  This is how we fight our bad.
[30.00 --> 59.98]  This is how we fight our bad.
[60.00 --> 89.98]  This is how we fight our bad.
[90.00 --> 119.98]  This is how we fight our bad.
[119.98 --> 149.96]  This is how we fight our bad.
[149.96 --> 179.94]  This is how we fight our bad.
[179.94 --> 181.94]  This is how we fight our bad.
[181.94 --> 185.94]  This is how we fight our bad.
[185.94 --> 189.94]  This is how we fight our bad.
[189.94 --> 199.94]  This is how we fight our bad.
[199.94 --> 209.94]  This is how we fight our bad.
[209.94 --> 211.94]  This is how we fight our bad.
[211.94 --> 221.94]  This is how we fight our bad.
[221.94 --> 223.94]  This is how we fight our bad.
[223.94 --> 233.94]  This is how we fight our bad.
[233.94 --> 235.94]  This is how we fight our bad.
[235.94 --> 237.94]  This is how we fight our bad.
[237.94 --> 247.94]  This is how we fight our bad.
[247.94 --> 249.94]  Oh my God.
[249.94 --> 251.94]  This is how we fight our bad.
[251.94 --> 278.94]  I'm going to go across the sea to a city with one king, a city on a green piece, a city on a green piece, a city on a green piece, a city on a green piece, a city on a green piece.
[281.94 --> 293.94]  If we got a star somewhere, why not here? If we got a star sometime, why not now?
[311.94 --> 318.94]  I'm going to go across the sea.
[318.94 --> 323.94]  Hold it all together, everybody needs you strong.
[323.94 --> 329.94]  But life hits you out of nowhere and barely leaves you holding on.
[329.94 --> 340.94]  And when you're tired of fighting, chained by your control, there's freedom in surrender.
[340.94 --> 343.94]  Lay it down and let it go.
[343.94 --> 349.94]  So when you're on your knees, an answer seems so far away.
[349.94 --> 355.94]  You're not alone, stop holding on and just be held.
[355.94 --> 362.94]  Your world's not falling apart, it's falling into place.
[362.94 --> 368.94]  I'm on the throne, stop holding on and just be held.
[368.94 --> 374.94]  Just be held.
[374.94 --> 387.94]  If your eyes are on the storm, you wonder if I love you still.
[387.94 --> 393.94]  But if your eyes are on the cross, you know I always have and I always will.
[393.94 --> 408.94]  You're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone.
[408.94 --> 420.94]  You're not alone, stop holding on and just be held.
[420.94 --> 425.94]  Your world's not falling apart, it's falling into place.
[425.94 --> 431.94]  I'm on the throne, stop holding on and just be held.
[431.94 --> 437.94]  Just be held.
[437.94 --> 444.94]  Just be held.
[444.94 --> 448.94]  Lift your hands, lift your eyes.
[448.94 --> 451.94]  In the storm is where you'll find me.
[451.94 --> 454.94]  And where you are, I'll hold your heart.
[454.94 --> 457.94]  I'll hold your heart.
[457.94 --> 460.94]  Come to me, find your rest.
[460.94 --> 466.94]  In the arms of the God who won't let go.
[466.94 --> 467.94]  You're not alone, you're not alone.
[467.94 --> 479.94]  You're not alone, stop holding on and just be held.
[479.94 --> 484.94]  Your world's not falling apart, it's falling into place.
[484.94 --> 489.94]  I'm on the throne, stop holding on and just be held.
[489.94 --> 492.94]  Stop holding on and just be held.
[492.94 --> 494.94]  Just be held.
[494.94 --> 495.94]  Just be held.
[495.94 --> 509.94]  Just be held.
[509.94 --> 511.94]  Just be held.
[511.94 --> 513.08]  The sun walked hard.
[541.94 --> 547.52]  The Savior of the world was fallen
[547.52 --> 551.56]  His body on the cross
[551.56 --> 555.16]  His blood poured out for us
[555.16 --> 560.82]  The weight of every curse upon Him
[571.94 --> 577.92]  One final breath He gave
[577.92 --> 580.90]  As heaven looked away
[580.90 --> 587.04]  The Son of God was laid in darkness
[587.04 --> 590.54]  A battle in the grave
[590.54 --> 593.38]  The war on death is
[601.94 --> 627.20]  Good morning, how are we doing?
[627.20 --> 633.40]  All right, we're going to let people continue filtering in
[633.40 --> 634.60]  There's lots of room up front
[634.60 --> 637.68]  So don't hesitate to make your way in here
[637.68 --> 640.78]  My name is Chris, I'm one of the pastors here
[640.78 --> 643.06]  And I want to welcome you to our worship this morning
[643.06 --> 644.44]  Especially if you're visiting with us
[644.44 --> 646.02]  Either in person or online
[646.02 --> 648.12]  Thank you for coming and checking us out
[648.12 --> 650.06]  Please don't hesitate to grab myself
[650.06 --> 652.38]  Or someone else you see with a name tag
[652.38 --> 653.60]  After the service
[653.60 --> 655.46]  And we can answer some of your questions
[655.46 --> 656.82]  And connect with you in that way
[656.82 --> 659.16]  Before we begin this morning
[659.16 --> 660.42]  There are just a couple announcements
[660.42 --> 662.12]  And then a brief explanation
[662.12 --> 668.44]  First of all, there is no HCBC youth education tonight
[668.44 --> 671.56]  That's been rescheduled to next week, Sunday evening
[671.56 --> 674.70]  Parents and youth, you've got an email about that
[674.70 --> 676.76]  But in case you missed it, that's for you
[676.76 --> 680.64]  Also, Perry Dasiak's care group
[680.64 --> 683.60]  Is going to meet after service today
[683.60 --> 684.96]  In the multi-purpose room
[684.96 --> 685.86]  Which is just down there
[685.86 --> 687.18]  So if you've connected with Perry
[687.18 --> 688.52]  Or been connected to Perry
[688.52 --> 690.30]  In that small group
[690.30 --> 691.00]  You're going to have a meeting
[691.00 --> 692.88]  Just to get that started and rolling
[692.88 --> 694.90]  And so please head down to there
[694.90 --> 698.04]  If you are interested in joining a care group
[698.04 --> 699.58]  Or hosting a care group
[699.58 --> 700.24]  Facilitating
[700.24 --> 702.24]  You can talk to Katie DeGeis
[702.24 --> 703.02]  Or to myself
[703.02 --> 704.90]  Or contact the office
[704.90 --> 706.34]  And we'll put you in touch with Katie
[706.34 --> 708.86]  And get that rolling as well
[708.86 --> 713.98]  Finally, today is October 31st
[713.98 --> 715.20]  And so who knows what that means
[715.20 --> 717.96]  Halloween
[717.96 --> 719.06]  Reformation Day
[719.06 --> 719.70]  Thank you
[719.70 --> 722.16]  That's the one I was looking for
[722.16 --> 724.60]  That's my wife, guys
[724.60 --> 726.42]  She knows
[726.42 --> 729.32]  So today is in fact Halloween
[729.32 --> 731.76]  And for us here in church
[731.76 --> 733.08]  It is Reformation Day
[733.08 --> 737.46]  Now, that may not mean much to many of you
[737.46 --> 742.90]  But Reformation Day is the day on which Martin Luther
[742.90 --> 748.96]  Augustinian monk in the 15th century, 16th century
[748.96 --> 753.68]  Posted 95 theses or 95 points of protest
[753.68 --> 755.88]  Against the Roman Catholic Church
[755.88 --> 759.24]  And what started the Protestant church
[759.24 --> 761.28]  And so that was in 1517
[761.28 --> 765.10]  We mark that day every year
[765.10 --> 769.28]  As a reminder of where we have come
[769.28 --> 771.70]  And part of our worship today
[771.70 --> 777.80]  Has been planned with that remembering in mind
[777.80 --> 783.04]  And so we are going to hear some themes in our worship and the like
[783.04 --> 785.20]  That come straight out of the Reformation
[785.20 --> 788.62]  And so Reformation really occurred around
[788.62 --> 793.72]  What's called the formal principle of the Reformation
[793.72 --> 796.66]  Which is the Latin phrase sola scriptura
[796.66 --> 798.50]  Which means by scripture alone
[798.50 --> 805.66]  And so scripture, the Bible, is the only authoritative source of divine revelation for life and faith
[805.66 --> 810.22]  And then the material principle coming out of that idea
[810.22 --> 815.28]  Is that justification, salvation, how we are made right with God
[815.28 --> 821.02]  Is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone, to the glory of God alone
[821.02 --> 828.46]  And so those ideas you will hear reverberating throughout our worship this morning
[828.46 --> 831.74]  And so keep your ears and your hearts attuned to those principles
[831.74 --> 837.06]  Part of that will be applying this idea that the old is new
[837.06 --> 839.26]  Which is a Reformation principle
[839.26 --> 844.08]  And so we will hear some and sing some classic songs with a bit of a new twist
[844.08 --> 847.26]  Or we'll take some classic ideas and doctrines
[847.26 --> 849.72]  Something like the Heidelberg Catechism, for instance
[849.72 --> 853.26]  And put that to a new setting and arrangement
[853.26 --> 857.80]  And so we're going to live the principles of Reformation in our worship together today
[857.80 --> 859.50]  And so to do that
[859.50 --> 861.08]  Let's stand
[861.08 --> 863.96]  And we can be welcomed into God's presence
[863.96 --> 865.28]  And so if you are here at home
[865.28 --> 866.06]  I encourage you to
[866.06 --> 867.36]  Here or at home
[867.36 --> 868.40]  I encourage you to
[868.40 --> 871.14]  Receive the greeting of our God
[871.14 --> 873.46]  Grace
[873.46 --> 874.90]  Mercy
[874.90 --> 876.34]  And peace to you
[876.34 --> 877.62]  From God our Father
[877.62 --> 878.74]  From the Lord Jesus Christ
[878.74 --> 879.36]  His Son
[879.36 --> 880.50]  And our Savior
[880.50 --> 882.56]  Through the presence and power
[882.56 --> 884.10]  Of the Holy Spirit
[884.10 --> 885.42]  Amen
[885.42 --> 887.02]  Let's worship God together
[910.50 --> 918.38]  Great is thy faithfulness
[918.38 --> 921.26]  O God my Father
[921.26 --> 928.98]  There is no shadow of turning with thee
[928.98 --> 934.58]  Though changest not thy compassions
[934.58 --> 936.66]  They fail not
[936.66 --> 939.82]  As thou hast been
[939.82 --> 944.26]  Thou forever will be
[944.26 --> 953.82]  Summer and winter
[953.82 --> 957.86]  And springtime and harvest
[957.86 --> 960.66]  Sun, moon and stars
[960.66 --> 964.66]  In their courses above
[964.66 --> 969.10]  Join with all nature
[969.10 --> 972.54]  In manifold witness
[972.54 --> 976.54]  To thy great faithfulness
[976.54 --> 980.54]  Mercy and love
[980.54 --> 986.00]  Beginning to end
[986.00 --> 989.78]  My life in your hands
[989.78 --> 997.00]  Great, great is your faithfulness
[997.00 --> 1000.34]  You never let go
[1000.34 --> 1003.90]  This one thing I know
[1003.90 --> 1011.90]  Great, great is your faithfulness
[1011.90 --> 1016.34]  Pardon for sin
[1016.34 --> 1020.34]  And a peace that endureth
[1020.34 --> 1024.44]  Thine old dear presence
[1024.44 --> 1028.08]  To cheer and to guide
[1028.08 --> 1030.84]  Strength for today
[1030.84 --> 1035.12]  And bright hope for tomorrow
[1035.12 --> 1035.46]  As well

[1589.30 --> 1593.14]  That our souls belong to me.
[1593.64 --> 1598.04]  Who holds our days within his hand?
[1599.00 --> 1603.04]  What comes upon us from his command?
[1603.04 --> 1608.04]  And what will keep us to the end?
[1609.04 --> 1614.04]  The love of Christ in which we stand.
[1614.04 --> 1620.04]  Oh, sing hallelujah.
[1620.04 --> 1626.04]  Our hope's faith eternal.

[1631.04 --> 1634.04]  Now and ever we confess.
[1635.04 --> 1639.04]  Christ our hope in life and death.

[1651.14 --> 1653.14]  God is good.

[1655.14 --> 1656.14]  God is good.
[1656.14 --> 1661.14]  Where is his grace and goodness known?
[1661.14 --> 1665.14]  The love of our great redeemer's love.
[1665.14 --> 1670.14]  Who holds our faith when fears arise?
[1670.14 --> 1675.14]  Who stands above the stormy child?
[1675.14 --> 1680.14]  Who sends the waves that bring us night?
[1680.14 --> 1685.14]  Until the shore of the rock of Christ.
[1685.14 --> 1686.14]  God is good.

[1728.10 --> 1733.26]  And what reward will heaven bring
[1733.26 --> 1737.72]  Everlasting life within
[1737.72 --> 1742.72]  There we will rise to thee for more
[1743.26 --> 1747.98]  Then sin and death will be destroyed
[1747.98 --> 1752.94]  And we will feast in endless joy
[1752.94 --> 1758.72]  When Christ is ours forevermore
[1758.72 --> 1764.72]  Oh sing hallelujah
[1764.72 --> 1771.26]  Our hope springs eternal, oh sing
[1771.26 --> 1777.72]  Hallelujah, now and ever we confess
[1777.72 --> 1781.72]  Christ our hope in life and death
[1781.72 --> 1786.86]  Oh sing hallelujah
[1786.86 --> 1793.40]  Our hope springs eternal, oh sing
[1793.40 --> 1799.86]  Hallelujah, now and ever we confess
[1799.86 --> 1804.40]  Christ our hope in life and death
[1804.40 --> 1808.60]  Now and ever we confess
[1808.60 --> 1812.86]  Christ our hope in life and death
[1812.86 --> 1842.46]  Today's offering is for budget only
[1842.46 --> 1849.00]  This allows us to focus on the need to support our church ministries, programs, staff
[1849.00 --> 1852.26]  Building, maintenance, missions and more
[1852.26 --> 1856.34]  Now that our ministries and programs have resumed
[1856.34 --> 1860.64]  It is also more important than ever to give our tithes
[1860.64 --> 1864.30]  There are only two months until the end of the year
[1864.30 --> 1867.40]  And unfortunately we are running a deficit
[1867.40 --> 1872.00]  Please consider giving generously and sacrificially
[1872.00 --> 1874.50]  2 Corinthians 9, 7
[1874.50 --> 1879.00]  Each should give what you have decided in your heart to give
[1879.00 --> 1882.14]  Not reluctantly or under compulsion
[1882.14 --> 1884.44]  For God loves a cheerful giver
[1884.44 --> 1905.94]  I am standing beneath your way
[1905.94 --> 1912.48]  I am resting in your shelter
[1912.48 --> 1919.82]  Your great faithfulness has been my shield
[1919.82 --> 1924.36]  And it makes me want to say
[1924.36 --> 1931.20]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[1931.20 --> 1937.50]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[1937.50 --> 1942.20]  I will bless your holy name
[1942.20 --> 1945.04]  For all my days
[1945.04 --> 1952.04]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[1952.04 --> 1958.58]  I sing praises to your name
[1958.58 --> 1960.58]  I sing praises to your name
[1960.58 --> 1962.58]  O Lord
[1962.58 --> 1968.58]  For you daily bear my burdens
[1968.58 --> 1974.58]  Your great faithfulness is my reward
[1974.58 --> 1977.12]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[1977.12 --> 1980.12]  And it makes me want to say
[1980.12 --> 1986.12]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[1986.12 --> 1993.12]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[1993.12 --> 1998.12]  I will bless your holy name
[1998.12 --> 2001.12]  For all my days
[2001.12 --> 2006.66]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[2006.66 --> 2008.66]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[2008.66 --> 2012.66]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[2012.66 --> 2019.66]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[2019.66 --> 2024.66]  I will bless your holy name
[2024.66 --> 2027.92]  For all my days
[2027.92 --> 2033.46]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[2033.46 --> 2049.46]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[2049.46 --> 2052.08]  I would love to invite all the kids to come forward
[2052.08 --> 2052.68]  Hi Isla
[2052.68 --> 2054.26]  All the kids to come forward
[2054.26 --> 2056.58]  Join me on the floor here
[2056.58 --> 2059.68]  For Kids Corner
[2059.68 --> 2067.62]  Good morning everyone
[2067.62 --> 2068.32]  Good morning
[2068.32 --> 2070.28]  Thanks Zoe
[2070.28 --> 2071.54]  That was nice
[2071.54 --> 2073.12]  Good morning everyone else
[2073.12 --> 2074.58]  There we go
[2074.58 --> 2075.06]  That's nice
[2075.06 --> 2076.84]  I have a friend with me today
[2076.84 --> 2077.68]  Did I bring him out?
[2078.32 --> 2078.54]  Yeah
[2078.54 --> 2078.76]  Yeah?
[2078.86 --> 2079.44]  Is that a good idea?
[2080.16 --> 2081.02]  Alright he's sitting behind me
[2081.02 --> 2081.96]  I'm not sitting on him
[2081.96 --> 2083.66]  I'm sitting in front of him
[2083.66 --> 2085.42]  Here he is
[2085.42 --> 2086.94]  Can you guys say hi to him
[2086.94 --> 2087.52]  When he comes out?
[2087.52 --> 2088.04]  He's a little bit shy
[2088.04 --> 2088.98]  He's never done this
[2088.98 --> 2091.18]  With you kids sitting in front of me before
[2091.18 --> 2092.76]  That's right
[2092.76 --> 2094.84]  So he's only used to talking to the camera
[2094.84 --> 2096.78]  So he's a little nervous
[2096.78 --> 2098.34]  So you have to be really nice
[2098.34 --> 2099.98]  And say hi when he comes out
[2099.98 --> 2100.56]  Okay are you ready?
[2100.56 --> 2101.82]  Okay here he comes
[2101.82 --> 2102.94]  Alright Hank
[2102.94 --> 2103.28]  Here we go
[2103.28 --> 2103.56]  You ready?
[2103.88 --> 2104.20]  Uh huh
[2104.20 --> 2110.36]  Who are they?
[2110.68 --> 2112.04]  These are the kids from our church
[2112.04 --> 2115.10]  Hi kids
[2115.10 --> 2116.06]  Hi
[2116.06 --> 2117.26]  Oh
[2117.26 --> 2118.60]  They seem nice
[2118.60 --> 2119.30]  They are very nice
[2119.30 --> 2120.06]  They're nice kids
[2120.06 --> 2120.56]  They're here
[2120.56 --> 2121.52]  They love to see you
[2121.52 --> 2122.42]  They're excited to meet you
[2122.42 --> 2123.08]  Hmm
[2123.08 --> 2124.62]  How's everyone doing?
[2125.10 --> 2125.58]  Good
[2125.58 --> 2126.34]  Good
[2126.34 --> 2129.28]  What have you been busy with lately?
[2129.64 --> 2130.16]  Halloween
[2130.16 --> 2131.18]  Halloween?
[2131.66 --> 2132.38]  What's that?
[2132.86 --> 2135.34]  It's a Halloween candy
[2135.34 --> 2136.24]  Candy?
[2137.14 --> 2137.74]  Hmm
[2137.74 --> 2138.82]  I don't really
[2138.82 --> 2139.88]  Do you like candy?
[2140.08 --> 2140.98]  Do you get other things?
[2140.98 --> 2144.98]  Toys
[2144.98 --> 2146.70]  And costumes
[2146.70 --> 2148.08]  Costumes?
[2148.50 --> 2150.06]  Who's dressing up as a dog?
[2152.98 --> 2153.54]  What?
[2153.66 --> 2155.72]  No one's dressing up as a dog?
[2156.14 --> 2157.82]  I'm just a super girl
[2157.82 --> 2158.40]  Oh
[2158.40 --> 2160.44]  Oh
[2160.44 --> 2161.88]  It sounds very exciting
[2161.88 --> 2163.32]  Now I've got a question
[2163.32 --> 2166.98]  What have you kids been doing in children's worship time?
[2167.30 --> 2167.66]  Do you remember?
[2167.76 --> 2169.00]  What was your story last week?
[2169.00 --> 2171.32]  Yeah Zoe you were first
[2171.32 --> 2171.88]  Climbing
[2171.88 --> 2173.00]  Climbing
[2173.00 --> 2173.42]  Okay
[2173.42 --> 2174.32]  Building a tower
[2174.32 --> 2175.60]  Building a tower
[2175.60 --> 2176.20]  Oh
[2176.20 --> 2177.24]  Do you remember too Haley?
[2177.92 --> 2179.94]  Did we get introduced to someone last week?
[2181.14 --> 2181.38]  No
[2181.38 --> 2183.94]  No
[2183.94 --> 2185.86]  All the way up
[2185.86 --> 2187.28]  Oh man
[2187.28 --> 2188.24]  Was that good?
[2188.58 --> 2189.16]  Was that good?
[2189.54 --> 2189.80]  No
[2189.80 --> 2190.66]  I forgot about you Hank
[2190.66 --> 2193.78]  That's not nice
[2193.78 --> 2196.56]  Do you
[2196.56 --> 2198.10]  Do we know what we're going to learn about today?
[2198.24 --> 2198.48]  What?
[2198.80 --> 2199.32]  Well you might
[2199.32 --> 2200.18]  You'll have to stay here I think
[2200.18 --> 2200.66]  Aww
[2200.66 --> 2202.92]  What do you think we're going to learn about today?
[2206.50 --> 2207.52]  We're going to learn about
[2207.52 --> 2209.26]  A man named Abraham
[2209.26 --> 2210.76]  And his son today
[2210.76 --> 2211.92]  That's what we're going to look at today
[2211.92 --> 2212.22]  Okay
[2212.22 --> 2213.28]  Does that sound good?
[2213.46 --> 2214.12]  Does that sound good for you?
[2214.12 --> 2215.44]  Does that sound good to you Hank?
[2215.54 --> 2215.86]  Yeah
[2215.86 --> 2221.72]  You did?
[2221.90 --> 2222.64]  Was he sitting here?
[2222.68 --> 2223.38]  He was very excited
[2223.38 --> 2224.72]  Do you know what Hank's been busy?
[2224.80 --> 2226.18]  So you guys have been in children's worship time
[2226.18 --> 2227.76]  Hank do you want to tell them what you've been busy with?
[2228.02 --> 2228.50]  Mm-hmm
[2228.50 --> 2230.02]  Have we seen Hank?
[2230.14 --> 2230.96]  It's been a little bit right?
[2231.02 --> 2231.66]  It's been four months?
[2232.16 --> 2232.96]  What have you been doing Hank?
[2233.44 --> 2234.98]  I've been digging a hole
[2234.98 --> 2236.36]  For four months?
[2236.58 --> 2236.86]  Yep
[2236.86 --> 2238.38]  Wow
[2238.38 --> 2240.42]  And it got so deep
[2240.42 --> 2242.96]  I found something so cool
[2242.96 --> 2243.96]  Do you want to see it?
[2244.40 --> 2245.22]  Yeah let's see it
[2245.22 --> 2245.64]  Hank you ready?
[2245.84 --> 2246.24]  Mm-hmm
[2246.24 --> 2255.64]  Look at this rock
[2255.64 --> 2258.38]  It's so cool
[2258.38 --> 2260.56]  Here I'll take it out
[2260.56 --> 2261.48]  Look
[2261.48 --> 2263.12]  It's a rock
[2263.12 --> 2264.92]  Have you ever seen anything like it?
[2265.60 --> 2268.98]  It took me four months of digging to find this
[2268.98 --> 2272.96]  A rock collection?
[2273.08 --> 2274.42]  That sounds awesome
[2274.42 --> 2282.38]  Oh
[2282.38 --> 2282.92]  Stoops
[2282.92 --> 2284.68]  Well we're going to hear more about rocks
[2284.68 --> 2286.34]  Later too in this story
[2286.34 --> 2286.66]  That's right
[2286.66 --> 2287.88]  We're going to hear about rocks in the story
[2287.88 --> 2289.30]  So last question
[2289.30 --> 2291.18]  That's a puppet
[2291.18 --> 2293.90]  Are you a puppet Hank?
[2294.04 --> 2295.16]  I don't think so
[2295.16 --> 2297.72]  If I was a puppet
[2297.72 --> 2298.70]  Could I do this?
[2301.82 --> 2302.10]  Boo
[2302.10 --> 2304.86]  All right
[2304.86 --> 2306.68]  We're
[2306.68 --> 2310.12]  Maybe
[2310.12 --> 2311.66]  It feels a little stuffed
[2311.66 --> 2313.22]  All right
[2313.22 --> 2314.46]  We are going to pray
[2314.46 --> 2315.12]  And then we're going to go
[2315.12 --> 2315.84]  Children's worship time
[2315.84 --> 2316.08]  Okay
[2316.08 --> 2316.86]  All right
[2316.86 --> 2317.58]  So bow your heads
[2317.58 --> 2318.26]  You too Hank
[2318.26 --> 2320.26]  And then we're going to do
[2320.26 --> 2321.58]  The children's blessing
[2321.58 --> 2322.20]  And then we're going to go
[2322.20 --> 2322.40]  Okay
[2322.40 --> 2322.92]  So let's pray
[2322.92 --> 2323.64]  Let's fold our hands
[2323.64 --> 2324.16]  Close our eyes
[2324.16 --> 2324.74]  Dear God
[2324.74 --> 2325.40]  Thank you so much
[2325.40 --> 2326.42]  That we could be in church today
[2326.42 --> 2327.98]  Thank you for fun things
[2327.98 --> 2328.56]  Like Halloween
[2328.56 --> 2329.72]  For a day like today
[2329.72 --> 2330.82]  Which is Reformation Day
[2330.82 --> 2331.32]  Where we remember
[2331.32 --> 2332.26]  What you have done
[2332.26 --> 2332.80]  For the church
[2332.80 --> 2333.60]  And we thank you
[2333.60 --> 2334.14]  For the Bible
[2334.14 --> 2335.48]  And the stories that we hear
[2335.48 --> 2336.76]  And the story that we are going to hear today
[2336.76 --> 2337.34]  In the back
[2337.34 --> 2337.92]  And we just pray
[2337.92 --> 2338.96]  That you'll be with us
[2338.96 --> 2339.60]  As we learn that
[2339.60 --> 2340.70]  Be with all the grown-ups
[2340.70 --> 2341.62]  Here in the church too
[2341.62 --> 2343.86]  As they learn about the Bible
[2343.86 --> 2345.06]  And how it affects their lives
[2345.06 --> 2345.64]  And we just pray
[2345.64 --> 2347.62]  That this is a glorifying time to you
[2347.62 --> 2348.56]  We pray this in your name
[2348.56 --> 2349.04]  Amen
[2349.04 --> 2349.68]  Amen
[2349.68 --> 2350.56]  All right
[2350.56 --> 2351.12]  Stand up
[2351.12 --> 2352.16]  Church
[2352.16 --> 2352.64]  You two
[2352.64 --> 2354.60]  And we're going to do
[2354.60 --> 2355.68]  The children's blessing
[2355.68 --> 2356.40]  Remember what we say
[2356.40 --> 2357.68]  All righty
[2357.68 --> 2358.52]  We're going to say it together
[2358.52 --> 2361.50]  The Lord be with you
[2361.50 --> 2363.42]  Also with you
[2363.42 --> 2363.86]  All righty
[2363.86 --> 2364.42]  Have fun
[2364.42 --> 2365.26]  Say bye to Hank
[2365.26 --> 2365.94]  Bye
[2365.94 --> 2366.84]  Bye
[2366.84 --> 2388.14]  Ladies and gentlemen
[2388.14 --> 2389.78]  That was definitely not a puppet
[2389.78 --> 2391.12]  Puppet Hank the Hound
[2391.12 --> 2393.60]  Live and in person
[2393.60 --> 2396.84]  I'm going to lead you
[2396.84 --> 2399.62]  In our church family prayer together
[2399.62 --> 2403.26]  And as we do that
[2403.26 --> 2406.28]  Just a reminder
[2406.28 --> 2408.24]  That some of the things
[2408.24 --> 2410.66]  That we pray generically for
[2410.66 --> 2413.24]  You know the specifics of
[2413.24 --> 2414.64]  And you know the individuals
[2414.64 --> 2417.08]  Specifically involved in that
[2417.08 --> 2418.34]  And so I want to encourage you
[2418.34 --> 2420.68]  Not just in prayer together today
[2420.68 --> 2422.14]  As we lift these people up
[2422.14 --> 2423.08]  But throughout the week
[2423.08 --> 2425.10]  Remember these circumstances
[2425.10 --> 2426.48]  And situations in prayer
[2426.48 --> 2427.74]  And then wonder also
[2427.74 --> 2430.10]  How God might use you
[2430.10 --> 2431.42]  To be the answer
[2431.42 --> 2432.70]  To the prayer that we give today
[2432.70 --> 2434.52]  Let's come to God
[2434.52 --> 2435.48]  In prayer together
[2435.48 --> 2442.02]  Heavenly Father
[2442.02 --> 2443.52]  As we gather here
[2443.52 --> 2445.04]  In your name
[2445.04 --> 2447.06]  We gather because
[2447.06 --> 2448.52]  You are most glorious
[2448.52 --> 2450.02]  We gather because
[2450.02 --> 2451.28]  You are most worthy
[2451.28 --> 2452.48]  To be praised
[2452.48 --> 2453.72]  We gather because
[2453.72 --> 2455.50]  To you alone
[2455.50 --> 2457.34]  Belongs all glory
[2457.34 --> 2458.26]  Honor
[2458.26 --> 2459.30]  And power
[2459.30 --> 2462.58]  We come here
[2462.58 --> 2464.94]  That we might behold
[2464.94 --> 2465.72]  Your face
[2465.72 --> 2468.06]  We come here
[2468.06 --> 2468.56]  That we might
[2468.56 --> 2469.54]  Be marked
[2469.54 --> 2470.88]  By your glory
[2470.88 --> 2472.86]  We come here
[2472.86 --> 2474.24]  That standing in
[2474.24 --> 2475.34]  Your radiance
[2475.34 --> 2476.24]  Our hearts
[2476.24 --> 2477.68]  Affections for you
[2477.68 --> 2478.60]  Might be stirred
[2478.60 --> 2479.74]  Our minds
[2479.74 --> 2479.78]  Our minds
[2479.78 --> 2480.38]  Might be
[2480.38 --> 2481.40]  Transformed
[2481.40 --> 2482.28]  As you work
[2482.28 --> 2483.82]  In the Holy Spirit
[2483.82 --> 2485.44]  And so Lord God
[2485.44 --> 2486.36]  Draw us
[2486.36 --> 2486.96]  Closer
[2486.96 --> 2488.18]  To yourself
[2488.18 --> 2489.16]  Today
[2489.16 --> 2492.14]  We come into
[2492.14 --> 2492.88]  Your presence
[2492.88 --> 2493.40]  Lord God
[2493.40 --> 2494.60]  Knowing that it is
[2494.60 --> 2495.72]  By Christ
[2495.72 --> 2496.34]  Alone
[2496.34 --> 2498.24]  That we can
[2498.24 --> 2500.34]  Find you
[2500.34 --> 2501.40]  And call you
[2501.40 --> 2502.08]  As father
[2502.08 --> 2503.16]  That it is by
[2503.16 --> 2504.26]  Jesus alone
[2504.26 --> 2505.20]  In your grace
[2505.20 --> 2506.38]  That we are
[2506.38 --> 2506.82]  Found
[2506.82 --> 2507.64]  By you
[2507.64 --> 2509.26]  And restored
[2509.26 --> 2510.02]  In relationship
[2510.02 --> 2512.24]  And so Lord God
[2512.24 --> 2512.84]  We marvel
[2512.84 --> 2513.66]  At the majesty
[2513.66 --> 2514.48]  Of the gospel
[2514.48 --> 2515.10]  We marvel
[2515.10 --> 2515.78]  At the privilege
[2515.78 --> 2516.34]  Of coming
[2516.34 --> 2517.20]  Into your presence
[2517.20 --> 2518.42]  Of hearing it
[2518.42 --> 2518.98]  Proclaimed
[2518.98 --> 2519.70]  And we ask
[2519.70 --> 2520.28]  That you would
[2520.28 --> 2521.54]  Apply the gospel
[2521.54 --> 2522.28]  Truths
[2522.28 --> 2523.28]  Of your word
[2523.28 --> 2524.24]  To our hearts
[2524.24 --> 2524.90]  That we might
[2524.90 --> 2526.60]  Go from this place
[2526.60 --> 2527.84]  As your agents
[2527.84 --> 2529.16]  Of mercy
[2529.16 --> 2530.10]  And grace
[2530.10 --> 2530.72]  In the world
[2530.72 --> 2531.90]  As your ambassadors
[2531.90 --> 2533.32]  Of reconciliation
[2533.32 --> 2537.62]  God as ambassadors
[2537.62 --> 2538.64]  Of reconciliation
[2538.64 --> 2539.48]  We pray
[2539.48 --> 2540.22]  That you would
[2540.22 --> 2541.40]  Restore our
[2541.40 --> 2542.52]  Relationships
[2542.52 --> 2545.00]  We pray for those
[2545.00 --> 2546.76]  Places
[2546.76 --> 2548.44]  In our lives
[2548.44 --> 2550.18]  That are broken
[2550.18 --> 2551.96]  Those relationships
[2551.96 --> 2552.88]  In our
[2552.88 --> 2553.84]  Families
[2553.84 --> 2555.04]  And friends
[2555.04 --> 2556.92]  And colleagues
[2556.92 --> 2558.08]  And co-workers
[2558.08 --> 2559.02]  Those relationships
[2559.02 --> 2560.34]  In our church
[2560.34 --> 2561.00]  Family
[2561.00 --> 2562.86]  That need
[2562.86 --> 2564.34]  Your gospel
[2564.34 --> 2565.14]  Healing
[2565.14 --> 2567.98]  And so Lord God
[2567.98 --> 2568.46]  We pray
[2568.46 --> 2569.76]  For humility
[2569.76 --> 2572.40]  And we pray
[2572.40 --> 2572.84]  For
[2572.84 --> 2574.62]  Willing spirits
[2574.62 --> 2576.04]  To enter into

[2579.56 --> 2579.92]  Together
[2579.92 --> 2581.36]  That we might
[2581.36 --> 2582.02]  Understand
[2582.02 --> 2584.86]  Not only
[2584.86 --> 2586.38]  What we have
[2586.38 --> 2586.76]  Done
[2586.76 --> 2587.74]  But that we
[2587.74 --> 2588.38]  Might come to
[2588.38 --> 2589.20]  A new understanding
[2589.20 --> 2590.42]  Into what you
[2590.42 --> 2590.98]  Have done
[2590.98 --> 2591.94]  That we might
[2591.94 --> 2592.70]  Allow the gospel
[2592.70 --> 2593.38]  To restore
[2593.38 --> 2594.88]  Our relationships
[2594.88 --> 2595.66]  Here
[2595.66 --> 2598.06]  Father God
[2598.06 --> 2599.02]  As we know
[2599.02 --> 2599.60]  That it is
[2599.60 --> 2600.56]  By grace alone
[2600.56 --> 2601.56]  Through faith alone
[2601.56 --> 2602.48]  In Christ alone
[2602.48 --> 2603.52]  That we are saved

[2607.42 --> 2608.40]  Those people
[2608.40 --> 2609.12]  In our lives
[2609.12 --> 2609.86]  Who maybe
[2609.86 --> 2610.74]  They are our sons
[2610.74 --> 2611.26]  Our daughters
[2611.26 --> 2611.92]  Maybe they are
[2611.92 --> 2612.50]  Our parents

[2812.60 --> 2813.94]  We thank
[2813.94 --> 2814.32]  You for
[2814.32 --> 2815.26]  The stories
[2815.26 --> 2815.62]  That we
[2815.62 --> 2816.08]  Can hear
[2816.08 --> 2817.40]  Of healing
[2817.40 --> 2817.96]  That happens
[2817.96 --> 2818.38]  We thank
[2818.38 --> 2818.92]  You again
[2818.92 --> 2819.94]  For the
[2819.94 --> 2820.48]  Story of
[2820.48 --> 2821.36]  Healing and
[2821.36 --> 2821.78]  Your hand
[2821.78 --> 2822.36]  Of protection
[2822.36 --> 2823.16]  On Patrick
[2823.16 --> 2824.66]  And yet
[2824.66 --> 2825.18]  We also
[2825.18 --> 2825.90]  Know Lord God
[2825.90 --> 2826.28]  That not
[2826.28 --> 2827.24]  Everyone has
[2827.24 --> 2828.28]  Recovered
[2828.28 --> 2828.76]  Not everyone
[2828.76 --> 2829.66]  Has healed
[2829.66 --> 2830.10]  Some are
[2830.10 --> 2830.58]  Still in the
[2830.58 --> 2831.02]  Midst and
[2831.02 --> 2831.54]  Some have
[2831.54 --> 2832.82]  Died as a
[2832.82 --> 2833.14]  Result
[2833.14 --> 2833.92]  And so
[2833.92 --> 2834.38]  God for
[2834.38 --> 2835.08]  For those
[2835.08 --> 2835.32]  Who are
[2835.32 --> 2835.74]  Mourning
[2835.74 --> 2836.84]  We pray
[2836.84 --> 2837.80]  Be near
[2837.80 --> 2838.22]  To them
[2838.22 --> 2839.56]  For those
[2839.56 --> 2839.90]  Who are
[2839.90 --> 2841.28]  Crying out
[2841.28 --> 2842.58]  In anguish
[2842.58 --> 2843.38]  And anxiety
[2843.38 --> 2844.52]  We pray
[2844.52 --> 2845.28]  That there
[2845.28 --> 2845.76]  Would be
[2845.76 --> 2846.96]  From us
[2846.96 --> 2848.24]  A compassion
[2848.24 --> 2849.28]  And a
[2849.28 --> 2849.82]  Willingness
[2849.82 --> 2850.24]  To come
[2850.24 --> 2850.88]  Alongside
[2850.88 --> 2851.14]  That we
[2851.14 --> 2852.00]  Might sit
[2852.00 --> 2852.62]  In that
[2852.62 --> 2853.14]  Dark night
[2853.14 --> 2853.92]  Of the soul
[2853.92 --> 2854.48]  Together
[2854.48 --> 2857.08]  God for
[2857.08 --> 2857.62]  Those who
[2857.62 --> 2859.12]  Have ongoing
[2859.12 --> 2860.32]  Health concerns
[2860.32 --> 2861.38]  That aren't
[2861.38 --> 2861.96]  Related to
[2861.96 --> 2862.54]  COVID and
[2862.54 --> 2862.82]  Yet are
[2862.82 --> 2863.56]  Still impacted
[2863.56 --> 2864.04]  By that
[2864.04 --> 2864.44]  Because of
[2864.44 --> 2864.84]  Postponed
[2864.84 --> 2865.32]  Treatments
[2865.32 --> 2865.88]  Or surgeries
[2865.88 --> 2866.46]  Or tests
[2866.46 --> 2866.76]  And the
[2866.76 --> 2867.18]  Like we
[2867.18 --> 2868.06]  Pray that
[2868.06 --> 2868.30]  You would
[2868.30 --> 2868.64]  Be near
[2868.64 --> 2869.10]  To them
[2869.10 --> 2869.92]  As well
[2869.92 --> 2871.42]  Father we
[2871.42 --> 2871.66]  Want to
[2871.66 --> 2872.18]  Continue in
[2872.18 --> 2872.78]  Prayer for
[2872.78 --> 2873.56]  Willie and
[2873.56 --> 2874.20]  Bob and
[2874.20 --> 2874.84]  Benita and
[2874.84 --> 2875.44]  Janet as they're

[2876.02 --> 2877.12]  Different treatments
[2877.12 --> 2877.48]  Or waiting
[2877.48 --> 2877.84]  For different
[2877.84 --> 2878.52]  Tests or
[2878.52 --> 2879.16]  Waiting for
[2879.16 --> 2880.22]  Whatever is
[2880.22 --> 2880.98]  Next in the
[2880.98 --> 2881.78]  Midst of

[2885.50 --> 2886.22]  Expedite
[2886.22 --> 2887.20]  Processes
[2887.20 --> 2887.78]  And that in
[2887.78 --> 2888.40]  The midst of
[2888.40 --> 2888.74]  It all
[2888.74 --> 2890.00]  You would
[2890.00 --> 2890.28]  Bring
[2890.28 --> 2891.38]  Peace
[2891.38 --> 2894.32]  Father God
[2894.32 --> 2894.62]  We want
[2894.62 --> 2894.98]  To pray
[2894.98 --> 2896.52]  Especially
[2896.52 --> 2897.08]  Tonight
[2897.08 --> 2898.18]  Because we
[2898.18 --> 2898.58]  Know that
[2898.58 --> 2898.84]  There will
[2898.84 --> 2899.88]  Be lots
[2899.88 --> 2900.40]  Of families
[2900.40 --> 2901.08]  And kids
[2901.08 --> 2902.36]  Walking around
[2902.36 --> 2902.68]  On the

[2903.24 --> 2903.52]  So we
[2903.52 --> 2903.98]  Pray for
[2903.98 --> 2904.40]  Your hand
[2904.40 --> 2904.98]  Of protection
[2904.98 --> 2906.14]  On them
[2906.14 --> 2907.28]  Tonight would
[2907.28 --> 2908.24]  Be an
[2908.24 --> 2909.08]  Opportunity to
[2909.08 --> 2909.74]  Laugh and
[2909.74 --> 2911.02]  To enjoy
[2911.02 --> 2912.38]  Communities
[2912.38 --> 2912.84]  Together
[2912.84 --> 2914.12]  Outside but
[2914.12 --> 2914.76]  We do pray
[2914.76 --> 2915.34]  Lord God
[2915.34 --> 2916.00]  For safety

[2917.82 --> 2919.40]  For your
[2919.40 --> 2920.48]  Hand on
[2920.48 --> 2921.16]  Those who
[2921.16 --> 2922.26]  Do go out
[2922.26 --> 2922.94]  Tonight
[2922.94 --> 2924.72]  Father God
[2924.72 --> 2925.42]  Now as we
[2925.42 --> 2926.10]  Come to
[2926.10 --> 2926.64]  Your word
[2926.64 --> 2927.30]  We ask
[2927.30 --> 2927.64]  That you
[2927.64 --> 2929.64]  Would take
[2929.64 --> 2930.50]  Its truth
[2930.50 --> 2931.12]  And apply
[2931.12 --> 2931.80]  It to our
[2931.80 --> 2932.16]  Lives
[2932.16 --> 2933.10]  Open us
[2933.10 --> 2933.54]  Up that we
[2933.54 --> 2934.06]  Might hear
[2934.06 --> 2935.10]  Directly
[2935.10 --> 2935.70]  From you
[2935.70 --> 2937.14]  We pray
[2937.14 --> 2937.72]  This Jesus
[2937.72 --> 2938.26]  In your
[2938.26 --> 2939.02]  Holy name
[2939.02 --> 2940.00]  Amen
[2940.00 --> 2951.08]  While I'm
[2951.08 --> 2951.64]  Moving over
[2951.64 --> 2951.88]  Here
[2951.88 --> 2952.64]  Dave
[2952.64 --> 2953.62]  I got a
[2953.62 --> 2954.26]  Notification
[2954.26 --> 2955.48]  That the
[2955.48 --> 2956.20]  Audio seems
[2956.20 --> 2956.70]  Funny on
[2956.70 --> 2957.06]  The live
[2957.06 --> 2957.42]  Stream
[2957.42 --> 2960.16]  Levi I
[2960.16 --> 2960.34]  Don't know
[2960.34 --> 2960.62]  If that's
[2960.62 --> 2961.02]  Something with
[2961.02 --> 2961.70]  OBS or
[2961.70 --> 2962.60]  Someone can
[2962.60 --> 2963.10]  Check that
[2963.10 --> 2968.94]  Okay
[2968.94 --> 2972.08]  We this
[2972.08 --> 2972.74]  Morning are
[2972.74 --> 2973.80]  Continuing in
[2973.80 --> 2974.68]  Our series
[2974.68 --> 2975.64]  In 1st Peter
[2975.64 --> 2977.60]  And we're
[2977.60 --> 2977.80]  Going to do
[2977.80 --> 2978.34]  Things just a
[2978.34 --> 2978.66]  Little bit
[2978.66 --> 2979.30]  Differently
[2979.30 --> 2980.20]  Together this
[2980.20 --> 2980.52]  Morning
[2980.52 --> 2983.24]  And I'm
[2983.24 --> 2983.50]  Going to
[2983.50 --> 2984.52]  Save the
[2984.52 --> 2985.30]  Reading of
[2985.30 --> 2985.90]  The text that
[2985.90 --> 2986.26]  We're going to
[2986.26 --> 2987.52]  Look at to
[2987.52 --> 2988.48]  Near the end
[2988.48 --> 2989.44]  Of our time
[2989.44 --> 2990.52]  Together but I
[2990.52 --> 2991.06]  Do want you to
[2991.06 --> 2991.90]  Have that there
[2991.90 --> 2993.08]  Ready and so
[2993.08 --> 2993.40]  We're going to
[2993.40 --> 2994.10]  Read later
[2994.10 --> 2995.00]  From 1st Peter
[2995.00 --> 2996.84]  3 verse 8
[2996.84 --> 2997.64]  Through 22
[2997.64 --> 2999.70]  But we'll
[2999.70 --> 3000.30]  Come to that
[3000.30 --> 3001.22]  In just a
[3001.22 --> 3001.80]  Moment before
[3001.80 --> 3002.76]  That before we
[3002.76 --> 3003.82]  Get there and
[3003.82 --> 3004.34]  For the first
[3004.34 --> 3005.26]  Bit I want to
[3005.26 --> 3006.28]  Sort of set
[3006.28 --> 3008.34]  The stage and
[3008.34 --> 3009.68]  Remind us of
[3009.68 --> 3011.40]  The context that
[3011.40 --> 3012.08]  The apostle
[3012.08 --> 3013.22]  Peter is
[3013.22 --> 3014.94]  Writing to and
[3014.94 --> 3015.70]  In the midst
[3015.70 --> 3018.72]  Of now if
[3018.72 --> 3019.06]  You've been
[3019.06 --> 3019.82]  Following along
[3019.82 --> 3020.36]  Or even if
[3020.36 --> 3020.68]  You just have
[3020.68 --> 3021.02]  Your bible
[3021.02 --> 3021.50]  In front of
[3021.50 --> 3021.72]  You and
[3021.72 --> 3022.26]  You flip
[3022.26 --> 3022.96]  Back through
[3022.96 --> 3023.54]  The section
[3023.54 --> 3024.40]  That we are
[3024.40 --> 3024.62]  Going to
[3024.62 --> 3025.30]  Read today
[3025.30 --> 3026.54]  In 1st Peter
[3026.54 --> 3027.54]  3 is a
[3027.54 --> 3027.90]  Sort of
[3027.90 --> 3029.04]  Capstone
[3029.04 --> 3030.00]  To the
[3030.00 --> 3030.66]  Point that
[3030.66 --> 3031.10]  Peter has
[3031.10 --> 3031.74]  Made in
[3031.74 --> 3032.14]  The previous
[3032.14 --> 3032.74]  Section that
[3032.74 --> 3033.06]  We looked
[3033.06 --> 3033.92]  At last
[3033.92 --> 3034.14]  Time
[3034.14 --> 3034.60]  Point that
[3034.60 --> 3035.10]  Peter has
[3035.10 --> 3035.62]  Been making
[3035.62 --> 3036.14]  Over and
[3036.14 --> 3036.56]  Over and
[3036.56 --> 3037.12]  Over again
[3037.12 --> 3037.48]  From the
[3037.48 --> 3037.98]  Very beginning
[3037.98 --> 3039.36]  And so
[3039.36 --> 3040.12]  Maybe you
[3040.12 --> 3041.00]  Recall but
[3041.00 --> 3042.00]  Peter is
[3042.00 --> 3042.72]  Writing to
[3042.72 --> 3043.48]  A group of
[3043.48 --> 3044.06]  Christians
[3044.06 --> 3045.58]  Many of
[3045.58 --> 3046.22]  Whom would
[3046.22 --> 3046.68]  Have been
[3046.68 --> 3048.38]  Early converts
[3048.38 --> 3049.64]  To christianity
[3049.64 --> 3050.70]  From judaism
[3050.70 --> 3051.60]  In the
[3051.60 --> 3052.38]  40s and
[3052.38 --> 3053.52]  50s a.d
[3053.52 --> 3054.58]  In this
[3054.58 --> 3055.06]  Group of
[3055.06 --> 3055.52]  Christians
[3055.52 --> 3056.22]  Peter tells
[3056.22 --> 3056.66]  Us in the
[3056.66 --> 3056.96]  Opening
[3056.96 --> 3057.62]  Verses
[3057.62 --> 3059.02]  Live in
[3059.02 --> 3059.82]  Pontus
[3059.82 --> 3060.54]  Galatia
[3060.54 --> 3061.42]  Cappadocia
[3061.42 --> 3062.18]  Asia
[3062.18 --> 3062.74]  And
[3062.74 --> 3063.28]  Bithynia
[3063.28 --> 3064.00]  Now if
[3064.00 --> 3064.48]  Pastor Kevin
[3064.48 --> 3064.80]  Was here
[3064.80 --> 3065.18]  That's
[3065.18 --> 3065.50]  I would
[3065.50 --> 3065.80]  Tell him
[3065.80 --> 3066.08]  That's
[3066.08 --> 3066.32]  How you
[3066.32 --> 3066.70]  Say that
[3066.70 --> 3066.94]  Word
[3066.94 --> 3067.70]  Because he
[3067.70 --> 3068.04]  Struggled
[3068.04 --> 3068.44]  Over it
[3068.44 --> 3069.20]  But i'll
[3069.20 --> 3069.54]  Remind him
[3069.54 --> 3069.76]  Later
[3069.76 --> 3071.72]  Now that
[3071.72 --> 3072.46]  That region
[3072.46 --> 3073.44]  Is actually
[3073.44 --> 3074.14]  Modern day
[3074.14 --> 3074.50]  Turkey
[3074.50 --> 3075.62]  And so
[3075.62 --> 3075.90]  If you
[3075.90 --> 3076.64]  Know anything
[3076.64 --> 3077.38]  About geography
[3077.38 --> 3078.04]  Think of
[3078.04 --> 3078.36]  Where modern
[3078.36 --> 3078.78]  Day turkey
[3078.78 --> 3078.94]  Is
[3078.94 --> 3079.18]  If you
[3079.18 --> 3079.36]  Don't
[3079.36 --> 3079.66]  Know anything
[3079.66 --> 3080.34]  About geography
[3080.34 --> 3081.16]  You can
[3081.16 --> 3081.58]  Google it
[3081.58 --> 3082.10]  And figure
[3082.10 --> 3082.38]  It out
[3082.38 --> 3084.78]  He is
[3084.78 --> 3085.32]  Addressing
[3085.32 --> 3086.60]  This group
[3086.60 --> 3087.40]  Of churches
[3087.40 --> 3089.12]  From the
[3089.12 --> 3089.44]  Beginning
[3089.44 --> 3090.94]  As elect
[3090.94 --> 3092.02]  Exiles
[3092.02 --> 3093.60]  So what he
[3093.60 --> 3093.92]  Means by
[3093.92 --> 3094.32]  That is that
[3094.32 --> 3094.70]  They have been
[3094.70 --> 3095.48]  Chosen by
[3095.48 --> 3095.96]  God
[3095.96 --> 3097.24]  But they
[3097.24 --> 3097.80]  Are not
[3097.80 --> 3098.58]  At home
[3098.58 --> 3099.44]  In the
[3099.44 --> 3099.64]  World
[3099.64 --> 3099.90]  Where they
[3099.90 --> 3100.18]  Live
[3100.18 --> 3101.58]  That's
[3101.58 --> 3101.68]  Who
[3101.68 --> 3101.90]  These
[3101.90 --> 3102.20]  People
[3102.20 --> 3102.54]  Are
[3102.54 --> 3104.56]  Now if
[3104.56 --> 3104.84]  You're
[3104.84 --> 3105.20]  Familiar
[3105.20 --> 3105.88]  With the
[3105.88 --> 3106.42]  Other books
[3106.42 --> 3106.72]  Of the
[3106.72 --> 3106.84]  New
[3106.84 --> 3107.30]  Testament
[3107.30 --> 3109.54]  The apostle
[3109.54 --> 3110.38]  Paul writes
[3110.38 --> 3111.06]  Some letters
[3111.06 --> 3111.52]  He writes
[3111.52 --> 3112.10]  To the church
[3112.10 --> 3112.76]  In Ephesus
[3112.76 --> 3113.56]  The Ephesians
[3113.56 --> 3114.00]  He writes
[3114.00 --> 3114.32]  To the
[3114.32 --> 3114.88]  Galatians
[3114.88 --> 3115.52]  And he
[3115.52 --> 3115.74]  Writes
[3115.74 --> 3116.02]  To the
[3116.02 --> 3116.66]  Colossians
[3116.66 --> 3117.34]  Those are
[3117.34 --> 3117.74]  All churches
[3117.74 --> 3118.32]  In this
[3118.32 --> 3118.70]  Region
[3118.70 --> 3120.18]  Right
[3120.18 --> 3120.50]  The apostle
[3120.50 --> 3121.20]  Paul spent
[3121.20 --> 3122.12]  The majority
[3122.12 --> 3122.66]  Of his
[3122.66 --> 3123.18]  Missionary
[3123.18 --> 3123.54]  Journeys
[3123.54 --> 3123.98]  Except for
[3123.98 --> 3124.32]  The fourth
[3124.32 --> 3124.62]  One where
[3124.62 --> 3124.86]  He went
[3124.86 --> 3125.12]  Out to
[3125.12 --> 3125.32]  Rome
[3125.32 --> 3126.30]  In this
[3126.30 --> 3127.36]  Region
[3127.36 --> 3128.86]  And in
[3128.86 --> 3129.30]  Fact as
[3129.30 --> 3129.94]  Paul is
[3129.94 --> 3130.30]  Nearing
[3130.30 --> 3130.74]  The end
[3130.74 --> 3130.98]  Of his
[3130.98 --> 3131.30]  Life
[3131.30 --> 3131.84]  He writes
[3131.84 --> 3132.62]  A second
[3132.62 --> 3132.88]  Letter
[3132.88 --> 3133.52]  To Timothy
[3133.52 --> 3134.82]  And in
[3134.82 --> 3135.78]  That letter
[3135.78 --> 3136.12]  And this
[3136.12 --> 3136.68]  Is fascinating
[3136.68 --> 3137.06]  To the
[3137.06 --> 3137.58]  Context
[3137.58 --> 3137.86]  Because
[3137.86 --> 3138.20]  Timothy
[3138.20 --> 3139.18]  Is in
[3139.18 --> 3139.86]  Ephesus
[3139.86 --> 3140.78]  Which is
[3140.78 --> 3141.08]  In this
[3141.08 --> 3141.44]  Region
[3141.44 --> 3142.36]  Paul says
[3142.36 --> 3142.90]  To Timothy
[3142.90 --> 3144.18]  You know
[3144.18 --> 3144.90]  That everyone
[3144.90 --> 3145.38]  In the
[3145.38 --> 3145.74]  Province
[3145.74 --> 3146.42]  Of Asia
[3146.42 --> 3147.32]  Has deserted
[3147.32 --> 3147.62]  Me
[3147.62 --> 3148.54]  And so
[3148.54 --> 3148.72]  That's
[3148.72 --> 3149.32]  This region
[3149.32 --> 3149.90]  Right
[3149.90 --> 3150.36]  That everyone
[3150.36 --> 3151.00]  Here has
[3151.00 --> 3151.60]  Deserted
[3151.60 --> 3152.32]  Paul
[3152.32 --> 3153.40]  Again
[3153.40 --> 3153.74]  If you're
[3153.74 --> 3153.98]  Familiar
[3153.98 --> 3154.36]  With the
[3154.36 --> 3155.24]  New Testament
[3155.24 --> 3155.86]  In the book
[3155.86 --> 3156.64]  Of Revelation
[3156.64 --> 3157.70]  The seven
[3157.70 --> 3158.40]  Churches
[3158.40 --> 3159.00]  That receive
[3159.00 --> 3159.48]  Letters
[3159.48 --> 3160.54]  Are all
[3160.54 --> 3161.22]  In this
[3161.22 --> 3161.74]  Region
[3161.74 --> 3162.58]  That Peter
[3162.58 --> 3163.18]  Is addressing
[3163.18 --> 3165.62]  The churches
[3165.62 --> 3166.22]  That Peter
[3166.22 --> 3166.88]  Is writing
[3166.88 --> 3167.28]  To
[3167.28 --> 3168.24]  Are in
[3168.24 --> 3168.60]  Trouble
[3168.60 --> 3170.54]  They're facing
[3170.54 --> 3171.62]  Hardship
[3171.62 --> 3172.94]  Maybe they
[3172.94 --> 3173.88]  Are shrinking
[3173.88 --> 3175.04]  As people
[3175.04 --> 3176.12]  Can't handle
[3176.12 --> 3177.30]  The persecution
[3177.30 --> 3178.14]  And the
[3178.14 --> 3178.64]  Suffering
[3178.64 --> 3179.90]  Right
[3179.90 --> 3180.36]  They're
[3180.36 --> 3180.88]  Deserting
[3180.88 --> 3181.62]  The gospel
[3181.62 --> 3182.78]  Because it's
[3182.78 --> 3183.62]  Easier
[3183.62 --> 3184.70]  It's more
[3184.70 --> 3185.26]  Comfortable
[3185.26 --> 3186.28]  And it's
[3186.28 --> 3186.74]  Safer
[3186.74 --> 3187.84]  Both ultimately
[3187.84 --> 3188.40]  In the sense
[3188.40 --> 3188.60]  That they
[3188.60 --> 3189.10]  Won't die
[3189.10 --> 3189.94]  But even
[3189.94 --> 3190.46]  More simply
[3190.46 --> 3190.90]  Than that
[3190.90 --> 3191.66]  It's safer
[3191.66 --> 3192.50]  Because blending
[3192.50 --> 3193.74]  In looking
[3193.74 --> 3194.42]  Like the culture
[3194.42 --> 3194.90]  Around you
[3194.90 --> 3195.52]  Is always
[3195.52 --> 3196.38]  Easier
[3196.38 --> 3197.42]  Than standing
[3197.42 --> 3197.78]  Out
[3197.78 --> 3200.70]  And we need
[3200.70 --> 3201.32]  To hear that
[3201.32 --> 3201.60]  Right
[3201.60 --> 3202.50]  That to a
[3202.50 --> 3203.00]  Group of
[3203.00 --> 3203.44]  Churches
[3203.44 --> 3204.10]  In trouble
[3204.10 --> 3205.32]  Where early
[3205.32 --> 3205.76]  Christians
[3205.76 --> 3206.92]  Are leaving
[3206.92 --> 3207.44]  The faith
[3207.44 --> 3208.00]  Because of
[3208.00 --> 3208.54]  Hardship
[3208.54 --> 3209.48]  Where false
[3209.48 --> 3210.00]  Teachers
[3210.00 --> 3210.92]  Are rising
[3210.92 --> 3211.56]  Up for their
[3211.56 --> 3212.14]  Own profit
[3212.14 --> 3212.48]  And their
[3212.48 --> 3213.00]  Own gain
[3213.00 --> 3214.06]  In a
[3214.06 --> 3214.44]  Region
[3214.44 --> 3215.04]  Also
[3215.04 --> 3215.78]  That Rome
[3215.78 --> 3216.48]  Is still
[3216.48 --> 3217.18]  Actively
[3217.18 --> 3217.94]  Trying to
[3217.94 --> 3218.78]  Colonize
[3218.78 --> 3219.48]  And bring
[3219.48 --> 3220.24]  Under thumb
[3220.24 --> 3221.40]  There's this
[3221.40 --> 3222.30]  Conflict
[3222.30 --> 3222.86]  That's taking
[3222.86 --> 3223.32]  Place
[3223.32 --> 3225.30]  Now
[3225.30 --> 3227.24]  Some of
[3227.24 --> 3227.42]  You are
[3227.42 --> 3227.56]  Going to
[3227.56 --> 3227.84]  Have to
[3227.84 --> 3229.06]  Forgive me
[3229.06 --> 3229.42]  For what
[3229.42 --> 3229.78]  I'm about
[3229.78 --> 3230.20]  To do
[3230.20 --> 3231.06]  Because I'm
[3231.06 --> 3231.24]  Going to
[3231.24 --> 3231.70]  Nerd out
[3231.70 --> 3232.06]  On a little
[3232.06 --> 3232.28]  Bit of
[3232.28 --> 3232.66]  History
[3232.66 --> 3233.32]  For a
[3233.32 --> 3233.52]  Moment
[3233.52 --> 3233.82]  And I
[3233.82 --> 3234.14]  Know that
[3234.14 --> 3234.42]  Some of
[3234.42 --> 3234.80]  You aren't
[3234.80 --> 3235.10]  Going to
[3235.10 --> 3235.64]  Appreciate
[3235.64 --> 3235.92]  That
[3235.92 --> 3236.16]  And I
[3236.16 --> 3236.36]  Also
[3236.36 --> 3236.58]  Know that
[3236.58 --> 3236.76]  Some of
[3236.76 --> 3236.92]  You are
[3236.92 --> 3237.08]  Going to
[3237.08 --> 3237.50]  Love it
[3237.50 --> 3238.58]  So for
[3238.58 --> 3238.86]  Those of
[3238.86 --> 3239.06]  You who
[3239.06 --> 3239.40]  Love it
[3239.40 --> 3239.76]  You're my
[3239.76 --> 3240.08]  People
[3240.08 --> 3241.16]  For those of
[3241.16 --> 3241.40]  You who are
[3241.40 --> 3241.76]  Just going to
[3241.76 --> 3242.02]  Deal
[3243.00 --> 3245.66]  I think
[3245.66 --> 3245.90]  We need
[3245.90 --> 3246.26]  To hear
[3246.26 --> 3246.52]  It
[3246.52 --> 3247.58]  Because I
[3247.58 --> 3248.24]  Think that
[3248.24 --> 3248.90]  Too many
[3248.90 --> 3249.60]  Of us
[3249.60 --> 3250.34]  Think of
[3250.34 --> 3250.88]  History
[3250.88 --> 3251.50]  Or think
[3251.50 --> 3251.78]  Of the
[3251.78 --> 3252.82]  Letters in
[3252.82 --> 3253.10]  The New
[3253.10 --> 3253.60]  Testament
[3253.60 --> 3254.80]  Written in
[3254.80 --> 3255.12]  History
[3255.12 --> 3255.52]  Or really
[3255.52 --> 3256.10]  Anything else
[3256.10 --> 3256.36]  That was
[3256.36 --> 3257.10]  Written in
[3257.10 --> 3257.36]  History
[3257.36 --> 3258.08]  We think
[3258.08 --> 3258.66]  About that
[3258.66 --> 3259.36]  As a
[3259.36 --> 3260.18]  Static
[3260.18 --> 3260.96]  Time
[3260.96 --> 3261.58]  And a
[3261.58 --> 3262.02]  Static
[3262.02 --> 3262.64]  Place
[3262.64 --> 3263.06]  Like the
[3263.06 --> 3264.02]  Culture is
[3264.02 --> 3264.26]  Somehow
[3264.26 --> 3265.00]  Fixed
[3265.00 --> 3266.90]  Because from
[3266.90 --> 3267.64]  Our perspective
[3267.64 --> 3267.94]  On the
[3267.94 --> 3268.28]  Past
[3268.28 --> 3268.76]  It is
[3268.76 --> 3270.94]  But when
[3270.94 --> 3271.38]  You're living
[3271.38 --> 3271.92]  In it
[3271.92 --> 3273.06]  That's
[3273.06 --> 3273.34]  Just not
[3273.34 --> 3273.66]  True
[3273.66 --> 3275.18]  At this
[3275.18 --> 3275.50]  Part of
[3275.50 --> 3275.90]  The world
[3275.90 --> 3276.68]  The western
[3276.68 --> 3277.12]  Part of
[3277.12 --> 3277.58]  This region
[3277.58 --> 3277.90]  Actually
[3277.90 --> 3278.26]  So what
[3278.26 --> 3278.66]  Is referred
[3278.66 --> 3279.56]  To by
[3279.56 --> 3280.36]  Peter as
[3280.36 --> 3281.00]  Asia and
[3281.00 --> 3281.56]  Bithynia
[3281.56 --> 3282.92]  Has only
[3282.92 --> 3283.70]  Just been
[3283.70 --> 3285.12]  Romanized
[3285.12 --> 3285.68]  Taken over
[3285.68 --> 3286.20]  By Rome
[3286.20 --> 3287.40]  In 133
[3287.40 --> 3287.78]  BC
[3287.78 --> 3289.38]  And then
[3289.38 --> 3290.18]  In 23
[3290.18 --> 3290.72]  BC
[3290.72 --> 3291.22]  So just
[3291.22 --> 3291.62]  Over 100
[3291.62 --> 3292.14]  Years later
[3292.14 --> 3292.56]  Caesar
[3292.56 --> 3293.20]  Augustus
[3293.20 --> 3293.50]  That's a
[3293.50 --> 3293.92]  Name probably
[3293.92 --> 3294.52]  Familiar to
[3294.52 --> 3294.82]  Many of
[3294.82 --> 3294.96]  You
[3294.96 --> 3295.66]  Caesar
[3295.66 --> 3296.20]  Augustus
[3296.20 --> 3296.52]  Makes
[3296.52 --> 3297.32]  Galatia
[3297.32 --> 3297.82]  Another one
[3297.82 --> 3298.06]  Of these
[3298.06 --> 3298.44]  Places
[3298.44 --> 3299.08]  A province
[3299.08 --> 3299.58]  Of Rome
[3299.58 --> 3301.42]  In 62
[3301.42 --> 3302.14]  AD
[3302.14 --> 3303.34]  About the
[3303.34 --> 3303.70]  Time that
[3303.70 --> 3304.02]  Our letter
[3304.02 --> 3304.40]  Is being
[3304.40 --> 3304.72]  Written
[3304.72 --> 3305.52]  Nero
[3305.52 --> 3305.92]  Who's
[3305.92 --> 3306.16]  The
[3306.16 --> 3306.50]  Roman
[3306.50 --> 3306.92]  Emperor
[3306.92 --> 3308.02]  Finally
[3308.02 --> 3308.74]  Removes
[3308.74 --> 3308.94]  He
[3308.94 --> 3309.62]  Abdicates
[3309.62 --> 3310.28]  Polman
[3310.28 --> 3310.70]  II
[3310.70 --> 3311.20]  As the
[3311.20 --> 3311.38]  King
[3311.38 --> 3312.02]  Of Pontus
[3312.02 --> 3312.26]  Another
[3312.26 --> 3312.54]  One of
[3312.54 --> 3312.68]  These
[3312.68 --> 3313.02]  Regions
[3313.02 --> 3313.60]  And then
[3313.60 --> 3313.72]  He
[3313.72 --> 3314.02]  Brings
[3314.02 --> 3314.16]  It
[3314.16 --> 3314.36]  Under
[3314.36 --> 3314.76]  Full
[3314.76 --> 3315.44]  Roman
[3315.44 --> 3316.08]  Colonial
[3316.08 --> 3316.58]  Control
[3316.58 --> 3318.00]  So this
[3318.00 --> 3318.22]  Is all
[3318.22 --> 3318.58]  Happening
[3318.58 --> 3319.16]  We can
[3319.16 --> 3319.38]  Zoom
[3319.38 --> 3319.58]  Out
[3319.58 --> 3319.78]  This
[3319.78 --> 3320.86]  Time
[3320.86 --> 3321.08]  In
[3321.08 --> 3321.42]  History
[3321.42 --> 3321.72]  Right
[3321.72 --> 3322.04]  Here
[3322.04 --> 3322.66]  Is
[3322.66 --> 3323.00]  What's
[3323.00 --> 3323.38]  Called
[3323.38 --> 3323.62]  The
[3323.62 --> 3324.02]  Roman
[3324.02 --> 3324.98]  Parthian
[3324.98 --> 3325.62]  Wars
[3325.62 --> 3326.62]  And it's
[3326.62 --> 3326.96]  A series
[3326.96 --> 3327.16]  Of
[3327.16 --> 3327.84]  Conflicts
[3327.84 --> 3327.96]  That
[3327.96 --> 3328.18]  Go
[3328.18 --> 3328.72]  Back
[3328.72 --> 3328.94]  And
[3328.94 --> 3329.26]  Forth
[3329.26 --> 3329.64]  Changing
[3329.64 --> 3330.12]  Borders
[3330.12 --> 3331.10]  Changing
[3331.10 --> 3331.60]  Names
[3331.60 --> 3332.42]  Redrawing
[3332.42 --> 3333.08]  Boundaries
[3333.08 --> 3333.88]  That starts
[3333.88 --> 3334.44]  In 53
[3334.44 --> 3334.94]  BC
[3334.94 --> 3335.64]  And then
[3335.64 --> 3336.24]  Continues
[3336.24 --> 3336.62]  All the
[3336.62 --> 3336.76]  Way
[3336.76 --> 3337.00]  Through
[3337.00 --> 3338.22]  217
[3338.22 --> 3338.94]  AD
[3338.94 --> 3339.56]  And that
[3339.56 --> 3340.04]  Especially
[3340.04 --> 3340.54]  Happens
[3340.54 --> 3340.96]  In the
[3340.96 --> 3341.48]  Eastern
[3341.48 --> 3342.00]  Region
[3342.00 --> 3342.22]  That
[3342.22 --> 3342.44]  Peter
[3342.44 --> 3342.60]  Is
[3342.60 --> 3342.84]  Writing
[3342.84 --> 3343.06]  To

[3344.56 --> 3344.72]  Of
[3344.72 --> 3344.94]  This
[3344.94 --> 3345.10]  Is
[3345.10 --> 3345.54]  Happening
[3345.54 --> 3345.82]  In
[3345.82 --> 3346.00]  The
[3346.00 --> 3346.40]  World
[3346.40 --> 3346.90]  And
[3346.90 --> 3347.16]  These
[3347.16 --> 3347.78]  Christians
[3347.78 --> 3348.12]  Are
[3348.12 --> 3348.42]  Trying
[3348.42 --> 3348.54]  To
[3348.54 --> 3348.72]  Make
[3348.72 --> 3348.88]  Their
[3348.88 --> 3349.10]  Way
[3349.10 --> 3349.30]  In

[3349.44 --> 3349.62]  Through
[3349.62 --> 3349.84]  It
[3349.84 --> 3350.72]  Right
[3350.72 --> 3350.88]  There
[3350.88 --> 3351.00]  Are
[3351.00 --> 3351.42]  Culture
[3351.42 --> 3351.86]  Wars
[3351.86 --> 3352.06]  There
[3352.06 --> 3352.20]  Are
[3352.20 --> 3352.74]  Literal
[3352.74 --> 3353.12]  Wars
[3353.12 --> 3353.34]  There

[3355.06 --> 3355.50]  There
[3355.50 --> 3355.62]  Are
[3355.62 --> 3356.02]  Histories
[3356.02 --> 3356.16]  That
[3356.16 --> 3356.22]  Are
[3356.22 --> 3356.38]  Being
[3356.38 --> 3356.76]  Written
[3356.76 --> 3357.08]  And
[3357.08 --> 3357.62]  Rewritten
[3357.62 --> 3357.86]  And
[3357.86 --> 3358.02]  Then
[3358.02 --> 3358.22]  Written
[3358.22 --> 3358.48]  Over
[3358.48 --> 3358.94]  Again
[3358.94 --> 3360.06]  But
[3360.06 --> 3360.20]  It's
[3360.20 --> 3360.42]  Not
[3360.42 --> 3360.62]  An
[3360.62 --> 3361.04]  Easy

[3395.56 --> 3395.84]  Take
[3395.84 --> 3396.12]  Over
[3396.12 --> 3397.28]  And
[3397.28 --> 3397.56]  Add
[3397.56 --> 3397.74]  To
[3397.74 --> 3397.92]  The

[3404.78 --> 3405.20]  Kids
[3405.20 --> 3405.40]  Who
[3405.40 --> 3405.64]  Grew
[3405.64 --> 3405.90]  Up
[3405.90 --> 3406.50]  In
[3406.50 --> 3406.66]  The
[3406.66 --> 3407.24]  U.S.

[3411.74 --> 3411.94]  Their
[3411.94 --> 3412.42]  Desks
[3412.42 --> 3414.16]  In
[3414.16 --> 3414.56]  Canada
[3414.56 --> 3415.58]  Right
[3415.58 --> 3415.70]  In
[3415.70 --> 3415.80]  The
[3415.80 --> 3415.94]  Middle
[3415.94 --> 3416.10]  Of
[3416.10 --> 3416.26]  This
[3416.26 --> 3416.52]  Time
[3416.52 --> 3416.68]  In
[3416.68 --> 3417.44]  1965
[3417.44 --> 3418.42]  We
[3418.42 --> 3419.26]  Developed
[3419.26 --> 3419.54]  A
[3419.54 --> 3419.78]  New
[3419.78 --> 3420.44]  National
[3420.44 --> 3420.92]  Flag
[3420.92 --> 3421.14]  The
[3421.14 --> 3421.36]  Flag
[3421.36 --> 3421.52]  That
[3421.52 --> 3421.62]  We
[3421.62 --> 3421.78]  Know
[3421.78 --> 3422.14]  Today
[3422.14 --> 3423.34]  Part
[3423.34 --> 3423.44]  Of
[3423.44 --> 3423.58]  The
[3423.58 --> 3423.94]  Purpose
[3423.94 --> 3424.18]  Of
[3424.18 --> 3424.38]  That
[3424.38 --> 3424.62]  Was
[3424.62 --> 3424.84]  To
[3424.84 --> 3425.72]  Pull
[3425.72 --> 3427.06]  Turns
[3427.70 --> 3428.26]  When
[3428.26 --> 3428.96]  Old
[3428.96 --> 3430.12]  Clamas
[3430.12 --> 3431.34] 어를
[3431.34 --> 3431.84]  Hard
[3440.46 --> 3444.54]  Life
[3444.54 --> 3444.82]  If
[3444.82 --> 3445.00] antic
[3445.00 --> 3445.78]  John
[3445.78 --> 3445.86]  Of
[3445.86 --> 3448.86]  and then you also did duck and cover drills.
[3448.86 --> 3452.86]  In fact, in the Greater Vancouver area,
[3452.86 --> 3457.86]  because of our geographic proximity to the then USSR,
[3457.86 --> 3459.86]  there was a pamphlet that was published.
[3459.86 --> 3460.86]  Maybe you remember this.
[3460.86 --> 3463.86]  It came out in 1963, I think.
[3463.86 --> 3466.86]  The pamphlet published was titled,
[3466.86 --> 3469.86]  and it was mailed out to all people who lived in the Greater Vancouver area.
[3469.86 --> 3473.86]  It was titled Civil Defense Evacuation and Survival Plan
[3473.86 --> 3477.86]  for the Greater Vancouver Target Area.
[3477.86 --> 3480.86]  Now, the tagline of this pamphlet is terrifying.
[3480.86 --> 3484.86]  It says, read it. Your life may depend on it.
[3484.86 --> 3487.86]  Some of you remember this time.
[3487.86 --> 3489.86]  And here's my point.
[3489.86 --> 3494.86]  When war or the threat of war looms,
[3494.86 --> 3498.86]  when cultures clash, whether it's Roman and Parthian
[3498.86 --> 3502.86]  or Soviet communism and Canadian liberal democracy,
[3502.86 --> 3504.86]  your response is the same.
[3504.86 --> 3509.86]  You unify around a shared identity and allegiance.
[3509.86 --> 3512.86]  You pull together and culturally,
[3512.86 --> 3517.86]  you begin to craft and develop a near-on religious identity
[3517.86 --> 3521.86]  made out of your political, national, and geographic identity.
[3521.86 --> 3524.86]  And so you might have heard during that time,
[3524.86 --> 3529.86]  to be a true Canadian is to be anti-communist.
[3529.86 --> 3531.86]  Now, it's historically reasonable to presume
[3531.86 --> 3535.86]  that the same kinds of things are happening when Peter is writing
[3535.86 --> 3537.86]  and to whom Peter is writing.
[3537.86 --> 3539.86]  Right? Whether you were a Roman triumphalist
[3539.86 --> 3541.86]  and you wanted to see that colonization came in,
[3541.86 --> 3543.86]  or you were an Anatolian historicist
[3543.86 --> 3545.86]  and you wanted to see the region remain the same,
[3545.86 --> 3547.86]  or you were a Parthian champion and you wanted them to win,
[3547.86 --> 3554.86]  the people in that time are being forced to decide on their allegiances.
[3554.86 --> 3559.86]  They're being forced to pick an identity.
[3559.86 --> 3562.86]  And in the turmoil that's going on around them,
[3562.86 --> 3564.86]  if you don't pick correctly,
[3564.86 --> 3567.86]  it is an end for you socially and politically.
[3567.86 --> 3571.86]  It is an end for you in their industry guild or whatever.
[3571.86 --> 3573.86]  Right? For the parallel,
[3573.86 --> 3575.86]  think about the way that communist sympathizers
[3575.86 --> 3578.86]  or people who were charged as agents of communism
[3578.86 --> 3580.86]  were treated in that time.
[3582.86 --> 3584.86]  And into that tension,
[3584.86 --> 3587.86]  Peter writes and he says,
[3587.86 --> 3590.86]  you are elect exiles.
[3590.86 --> 3593.86]  You are a chosen people.
[3593.86 --> 3596.86]  You are God's special possession.
[3596.86 --> 3599.86]  You are God's beloved.
[3599.86 --> 3601.86]  And he says,
[3601.86 --> 3603.86]  because that's who you are,
[3603.86 --> 3607.86]  you are foreigners and exiles,
[3607.86 --> 3610.86]  strangers and aliens,
[3610.86 --> 3613.86]  sojourners and pilgrims.
[3613.86 --> 3616.86]  You may live in Pontus,
[3616.86 --> 3618.86]  but you're not Pontian.
[3618.86 --> 3620.86]  You may live in Galatia,
[3620.86 --> 3622.86]  but you're not Galatian.
[3622.86 --> 3624.86]  You may live in Bithynia,
[3624.86 --> 3627.86]  but you're not Bithynian.
[3627.86 --> 3629.86]  Exactly when people are doubling down
[3629.86 --> 3633.86]  and solidifying their identities as Roman citizens,
[3633.86 --> 3635.86]  offering sacrifices to the emperor
[3635.86 --> 3638.86]  as their version of the pledge allegiance to the flag,
[3638.86 --> 3641.86]  or when they're solidifying their identities as not Roman,
[3641.86 --> 3643.86]  but Parthian or Pontian Galatian,
[3643.86 --> 3644.86]  Peter says,
[3644.86 --> 3646.86]  no,
[3646.86 --> 3648.86]  you are so much more.
[3648.86 --> 3651.86]  You are something different.
[3651.86 --> 3655.86]  There's huge cultural pressure in either direction,
[3655.86 --> 3656.86]  right,
[3656.86 --> 3659.86]  to Romanize or to hang on to the old ways.
[3659.86 --> 3661.86]  And Peter says,
[3661.86 --> 3664.86]  you have to go a third way.
[3664.86 --> 3667.86]  Now I think,
[3667.86 --> 3669.86]  and I would suggest to you,
[3669.86 --> 3671.86]  that this is happening,
[3671.86 --> 3673.86]  and this needs to happen,
[3673.86 --> 3675.86]  right now,
[3675.86 --> 3676.86]  in our world today,
[3676.86 --> 3677.86]  in our culture.
[3679.86 --> 3682.86]  Instead of the anarchist's cry from generations ago
[3682.86 --> 3683.86]  of no gods and no masters,
[3683.86 --> 3685.86]  our culture says,
[3685.86 --> 3686.86]  you,
[3686.86 --> 3688.86]  you are the master of the universe.
[3688.86 --> 3692.86]  Instead of our identities being connected to families
[3692.86 --> 3693.86]  or to a past,
[3693.86 --> 3698.86]  our identities are chosen by an exercise of our own wills,
[3698.86 --> 3699.86]  or our own feelings,
[3699.86 --> 3700.86]  our own whims,
[3700.86 --> 3701.86]  right?
[3701.86 --> 3703.86]  You just have to feel your way to yourself
[3703.86 --> 3706.86]  in order to be true to yourself.
[3706.86 --> 3707.86]  Right?
[3707.86 --> 3709.86]  Our culture approaches a religious identity
[3709.86 --> 3712.86]  from the perspective of absolute tolerance
[3712.86 --> 3714.86]  where everything is the same
[3714.86 --> 3716.86]  and everything means the same.
[3716.86 --> 3720.86]  They're just different expressions of the same fundamental idea.
[3720.86 --> 3723.86]  Now the same fundamental idea is that ultimately,
[3723.86 --> 3727.86]  religious experience is about how to be good and moral in the world.
[3727.86 --> 3731.86]  And then the secret of our contemporary modern culture
[3731.86 --> 3733.86]  is that if you know that secret,
[3733.86 --> 3734.86]  you don't need religion.
[3734.86 --> 3735.86]  Right?
[3735.86 --> 3736.86]  But you can be spiritual,
[3736.86 --> 3737.86]  whatever that means,
[3737.86 --> 3739.86]  because you can be good and moral
[3739.86 --> 3743.86]  apart from a system or a community who shares your belief.
[3743.86 --> 3744.86]  Right?
[3744.86 --> 3746.86]  In our culture,
[3746.86 --> 3751.86]  the world is simultaneously disenchanted.
[3751.86 --> 3754.86]  And what I mean by that is that we have removed God
[3754.86 --> 3758.86]  and the miraculous from it because of our positivism
[3758.86 --> 3760.86]  or because of our strictly materialistic worldviews.
[3760.86 --> 3764.86]  And yet, at the same time, seemingly unaware of the contradiction,
[3764.86 --> 3768.86]  our world is magical and still yet spiritual.
[3768.86 --> 3769.86]  Right?
[3769.86 --> 3772.86]  That you can have access to the powers built into the world
[3772.86 --> 3774.86]  in order to make yourself better
[3774.86 --> 3777.86]  or to make your circumstances more affluent,
[3777.86 --> 3779.86]  whether that's done by the right crystals
[3779.86 --> 3782.86]  or the right star charts or the right rituals,
[3782.86 --> 3787.86]  or not new but making its way back into the mainstream,
[3787.86 --> 3792.86]  is this process of micro dosing on LSD or mushrooms
[3792.86 --> 3794.86]  or other hallucinogenic drugs
[3794.86 --> 3797.86]  so that you can explore this new spiritual plane.
[3799.86 --> 3802.86]  Someone actually sent me an article this past week
[3802.86 --> 3804.86]  from Los Angeles Magazine.
[3804.86 --> 3805.86]  Right?
[3805.86 --> 3806.86]  That's about exactly this.
[3806.86 --> 3808.86]  And it's a fascinating read.
[3808.86 --> 3813.86]  In that article, one of the proponents, one of the evangelists, I'll say,
[3813.86 --> 3816.86]  of this new spirituality says the following.
[3816.86 --> 3817.86]  He says this,
[3818.86 --> 3824.86]  Our religious and spiritual institutions have become hollowed out shells.
[3824.86 --> 3826.86]  They're bereft in a way,
[3826.86 --> 3828.86]  and a lot of people want something more than that,
[3828.86 --> 3831.86]  an affirmation to their intuition,
[3831.86 --> 3832.86]  which is a beautiful line in itself,
[3832.86 --> 3834.86]  but an affirmation to their intuition
[3834.86 --> 3838.86]  that there's something beyond ordinary day-to-day life.
[3838.86 --> 3840.86]  There's a disillusionment,
[3840.86 --> 3842.86]  and people are looking beyond religion
[3842.86 --> 3845.86]  because it's not giving them what they need.
[3845.86 --> 3849.86]  And so he talks about how hallucinogenic drugs become that.
[3849.86 --> 3852.86]  Now let me be really clear on this, okay?
[3852.86 --> 3853.86]  Because some of you hear that,
[3853.86 --> 3854.86]  and you're tempted to think,
[3854.86 --> 3856.86]  oh, that's just a Vancouver Island hippie.
[3857.86 --> 3858.86]  Right?
[3858.86 --> 3861.86]  That's just an L.A. Instagram influencer.
[3861.86 --> 3865.86]  The person who I just quoted is a board member
[3865.86 --> 3867.86]  and the director of ethnopharmacology
[3867.86 --> 3869.86]  at the Hefter Research Institute.
[3869.86 --> 3873.86]  He is a PhD in botanical sciences from UBC.
[3873.86 --> 3875.86]  He's had post-doctorate research fellowships
[3875.86 --> 3877.86]  at the Laboratory in Clinical Pharmacology
[3877.86 --> 3879.86]  at the National Institute of Mental Health
[3879.86 --> 3880.86]  and the Department of Neurology
[3880.86 --> 3883.86]  at Stanford University School of Medicine.
[3883.86 --> 3885.86]  He's no crazy hippie.
[3885.86 --> 3889.86]  In the world today, people say,
[3889.86 --> 3891.86]  I don't believe in God,
[3891.86 --> 3895.86]  and then they go to Toys R Us and buy a Ouija board.
[3895.86 --> 3897.86]  Is Toys R Us still a thing?
[3897.86 --> 3899.86]  Did I just date myself, maybe?
[3900.86 --> 3901.86]  Tonight, right?
[3901.86 --> 3904.86]  Maybe you're joining the thousands of kids
[3904.86 --> 3906.86]  who are gonna go trick-or-treating,
[3906.86 --> 3908.86]  and at the same time,
[3908.86 --> 3910.86]  there are households holding seances
[3910.86 --> 3913.86]  because the veil between the physical and spiritual world
[3913.86 --> 3915.86]  is believed to be extra thin.
[3915.86 --> 3920.86]  There's a new generation of Wiccans and naturalists
[3920.86 --> 3922.86]  that are gonna be doing rituals in the forests.
[3922.86 --> 3925.86]  This is just our new normal.
[3925.86 --> 3928.86]  And let me be really clear,
[3928.86 --> 3931.86]  because there's a pull in the other direction as well.
[3931.86 --> 3932.86]  Right?
[3932.86 --> 3934.86]  So there's this cultural trend towards this new spirituality
[3934.86 --> 3936.86]  and a progressive ideology,
[3936.86 --> 3940.86]  and there is the counter-trend of the alt-right
[3940.86 --> 3942.86]  and of social conservatives.
[3942.86 --> 3945.86]  So on the one hand, we're told to join in the new
[3945.86 --> 3947.86]  or get left behind to history.
[3947.86 --> 3948.86]  On the other hand,
[3948.86 --> 3950.86]  reject the agenda of the elitist left
[3950.86 --> 3952.86]  or get trapped into a neo-Marxism.
[3953.86 --> 3955.86]  Christians are caught up in this too.
[3955.86 --> 3956.86]  Right?
[3956.86 --> 3957.86]  You have progressive Christianity
[3957.86 --> 3959.86]  that has adopted the values of tolerance
[3959.86 --> 3960.86]  and felt identity,
[3960.86 --> 3962.86]  and you have conservative Christianity
[3962.86 --> 3964.86]  that has been co-opted by a religious nationalism
[3964.86 --> 3966.86]  and even white supremacy.
[3966.86 --> 3967.86]  Right?
[3967.86 --> 3968.86]  Make no mistake about it.
[3968.86 --> 3971.86]  Just like the Christians to whom Peter is writing,
[3971.86 --> 3974.86]  our culture is telling you to choose
[3974.86 --> 3976.86]  the new way or the old way.
[3976.86 --> 3979.86]  And Peter tells us the exact same thing
[3979.86 --> 3981.86]  he told those Christians then.
[3981.86 --> 3984.86]  You are called to a third way.
[3984.86 --> 3987.86]  You may live in Canada,
[3987.86 --> 3989.86]  but you're not Canadian.
[3989.86 --> 3990.86]  Not first.
[3990.86 --> 3991.86]  Not even second.
[3991.86 --> 3996.86]  You are beloved of God.
[3996.86 --> 4001.86]  And so love what he loves.
[4001.86 --> 4003.86]  You are beloved of God,
[4003.86 --> 4006.86]  and so love the way that he loves.
[4006.86 --> 4011.86]  In a world that does not recognize Jesus,
[4011.86 --> 4020.86]  what you do and how you live must also be unrecognizable.
[4020.86 --> 4022.86]  It's going to be weird.
[4022.86 --> 4025.86]  It's going to be unique,
[4025.86 --> 4032.86]  but it's also going to be the only way those people will ever see Jesus.
[4032.86 --> 4038.86]  That's the uniqueness that Peter is calling us to,
[4038.86 --> 4039.86]  and that's the uniqueness,
[4039.86 --> 4044.86]  this uniqueness of life that Peter is outlining in this text.
[4044.86 --> 4046.86]  And so let's read it together.
[4050.86 --> 4052.86]  Feel all of those tensions.
[4052.86 --> 4056.86]  Feel all of that cultural pulling you one way or the other,
[4056.86 --> 4058.86]  and hear Peter say,
[4058.86 --> 4067.86]  Finally, all of you, be like-minded.
[4067.86 --> 4069.86]  Be sympathetic.
[4069.86 --> 4071.86]  Love one another.
[4071.86 --> 4074.86]  Be compassionate and humble.
[4074.86 --> 4078.86]  Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult.
[4078.86 --> 4082.86]  On the contrary, repay evil with blessing.
[4082.86 --> 4084.86]  Because to this you were called,
[4084.86 --> 4087.86]  so that you may inherit a blessing.
[4087.86 --> 4093.86]  For whoever would love life and see good days must keep their tongue from evil,
[4093.86 --> 4095.86]  and their lips from deceitful speech.
[4095.86 --> 4098.86]  They must turn from evil and do good.
[4098.86 --> 4100.86]  They must seek peace and pursue it.
[4100.86 --> 4102.86]  For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,
[4102.86 --> 4105.86]  and his ears are attentive to their prayers.
[4105.86 --> 4109.86]  But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.
[4109.86 --> 4116.86]  Who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good?
[4116.86 --> 4122.86]  But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed.
[4122.86 --> 4124.86]  Do not be afraid.
[4124.86 --> 4125.86]  Do not fear their threats.
[4125.86 --> 4127.86]  Do not be frightened.
[4127.86 --> 4133.86]  But in your hearts, revere Christ as Lord.
[4133.86 --> 4140.86]  Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have.
[4140.86 --> 4144.86]  But do this with gentleness and respect.
[4144.86 --> 4146.86]  Keeping a clear conscience,
[4146.86 --> 4152.86]  so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander.
[4152.86 --> 4158.86]  For it is better, if it is God's will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.
[4158.86 --> 4165.86]  For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God.
[4165.86 --> 4169.86]  He was put to death in the body, but made alive in the spirit.
[4169.86 --> 4173.86]  After being made alive, he went and proclaimed to the imprisoned spirits,
[4173.86 --> 4178.86]  to those who were disobedient long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built.
[4178.86 --> 4182.86]  In it, only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water.
[4182.86 --> 4186.86]  And this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also.
[4186.86 --> 4190.86]  Not the removal of dirt from the body, but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God.
[4190.86 --> 4194.86]  It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
[4194.86 --> 4203.86]  who has gone into heaven and is at God's right hand with angels and authorities and powers in submission to him.
[4203.86 --> 4206.86]  This is the word of the Lord.
[4206.86 --> 4214.86]  See, Peter understands the tension.
[4214.86 --> 4219.86]  He understands the being pulled to the left or to the right.
[4219.86 --> 4223.86]  And he says, no, you must go a third way.
[4223.86 --> 4231.86]  And then he outlines for us a third way that has two foci, two areas of focus.
[4231.86 --> 4238.86]  First, he writes about how believers will relate to one another, how we will relate to each other.
[4238.86 --> 4244.86]  And second, he writes about how believers will relate to those outside of the fellowship,
[4244.86 --> 4248.86]  to those outside of the church of Jesus Christ, whom he earlier called pagans.
[4248.86 --> 4253.86]  Right? The world that doesn't know God or recognize Jesus.
[4253.86 --> 4268.86]  Peter says that our church needs to be made up of the kind of people who are like-minded, sympathetic, loving one another, compassionate, and humble.
[4268.86 --> 4275.86]  I want to ask you, in all honesty this morning, is that you?
[4275.86 --> 4283.86]  Now, before we dig too deeply, I also want to acknowledge that some of you heard me say that,
[4283.86 --> 4287.86]  and you immediately started thinking about other people.
[4287.86 --> 4292.86]  Right? You started thinking, oh man, I hope that she hears him say humble this morning,
[4292.86 --> 4295.86]  because she could learn something about being humble.
[4295.86 --> 4302.86]  Right? You heard me say that, and you go, oh, I really hope that whomever, I'll say the name John,
[4302.86 --> 4304.86]  because there's like 20 of you here.
[4304.86 --> 4311.86]  Right? I really hope that they are listening, because they sure could use a dose of being like-minded and sympathetic.
[4311.86 --> 4320.86]  Or maybe you thought about your spouse, maybe you thought about a friend, maybe you thought about anyone that you wish you could change.
[4320.86 --> 4327.86]  If that was you, I want you to think about you.
[4327.86 --> 4331.86]  Don't worry about them. Don't be responsible for them.
[4331.86 --> 4338.86]  Take responsibility for you, for your own heart and your own life.
[4338.86 --> 4341.86]  This is you. Or is this you?
[4341.86 --> 4344.86]  Peter is calling you to this.
[4344.86 --> 4347.86]  Peter says, be like-minded.
[4347.86 --> 4353.86]  Now, there's another translation that says, live in harmony.
[4353.86 --> 4359.86]  Right? And so the idea here is that in a world divided, we are together.
[4359.86 --> 4365.86]  In a time and place that is constantly fractured, we are of one accord.
[4365.86 --> 4378.86]  Now, we don't have to agree on everything, but precisely because we agree on the essentials, we can live in harmony on those tertiary things.
[4378.86 --> 4382.86]  Peter says, to be sympathetic.
[4382.86 --> 4388.86]  Now, that word literally means sharing in the feelings of others.
[4388.86 --> 4390.86]  And so there's two questions here.
[4390.86 --> 4396.86]  One, do you share your feelings, your hurts and your joys, your struggles and your blessings?
[4396.86 --> 4403.86]  And two, do you make room in your life for others to share their feelings, their hurts, their joys, their struggles and their blessings?
[4403.86 --> 4415.86]  In a world that looks out for number one, in a world that has a me-first attitude, what can it look like to be a church who puts others first?
[4415.86 --> 4421.86]  Peter says, love one another.
[4421.86 --> 4425.86]  Again, literally in Greek there, the word is brotherly love.
[4425.86 --> 4426.86]  Philadelphoi.
[4426.86 --> 4430.86]  Right? Peter is saying, love as brothers and sisters.
[4430.86 --> 4434.86]  Right? You are not strangers to each other.
[4434.86 --> 4438.86]  You are not mere acquaintances or even distant relatives.
[4438.86 --> 4441.86]  And here's the reality, right?
[4441.86 --> 4449.86]  You might not even know the name of someone else who is here right now this morning, or someone who is a part of our church and is participating online this morning.
[4449.86 --> 4454.86]  We might not have seen them in a couple of years because of COVID and everything that's going on.
[4454.86 --> 4464.86]  But even if you don't know their name, because they belong to this church, they are your brothers and sisters.
[4464.86 --> 4469.86]  Imagine if we actually treated each other that way.
[4469.86 --> 4473.86]  We actually longed for each other in that way.
[4473.86 --> 4477.86]  We are close family.
[4477.86 --> 4482.86]  Peter says, be compassionate.
[4482.86 --> 4488.86]  I want to be clear because sometimes we think about compassion as just another word for sympathy.
[4488.86 --> 4495.86]  But in fact, again, in Greek, it's not even a word about conduct, but it's about your insides.
[4495.86 --> 4499.86]  Literally, it means your innards, your belly.
[4499.86 --> 4504.86]  Right? The literal translation of the Greek word here means feel generous in your belly.
[4504.86 --> 4511.86]  Now, in the ancient Near East, the seat of human emotion was rooted in the stomach.
[4511.86 --> 4513.86]  Your feelings were in your gut.
[4513.86 --> 4515.86]  We kind of carry this over, right?
[4515.86 --> 4518.86]  We have that expression, I just have a gut feeling about this.
[4518.86 --> 4520.86]  That's the same idea.
[4520.86 --> 4523.86]  Now, in our culture, the seat of emotions is the heart.
[4523.86 --> 4529.86]  But Peter here, he's not giving us instructions about necessarily what to do, but how to be.
[4529.86 --> 4537.86]  He's saying, be generous, be well disposed to each other in your deeps, way down in your gut.
[4537.86 --> 4538.86]  Right?
[4538.86 --> 4545.86]  And so here, it's about an authenticity and an integrity all the way through.
[4545.86 --> 4546.86]  Right?
[4546.86 --> 4560.86]  And so, it's the opposite of hypocrisy that acts tender on the outside, that says nice things on the outside, but on the inside feels right, angry, and jealous, and judging.
[4560.86 --> 4569.86]  But Peter is saying all the way down deep, be generous and well disposed to each other.
[4569.86 --> 4573.86]  Through and through, be for each other.
[4573.86 --> 4578.86]  And Peter says, be humble.
[4578.86 --> 4591.86]  Now, C.S. Lewis once said, and this has stuck with me forever, that true humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less.
[4591.86 --> 4592.86]  Right?
[4592.86 --> 4595.86]  Humility is putting others first.
[4595.86 --> 4600.86]  And so, imagine what you might do if you put the person in front of you first.
[4600.86 --> 4608.86]  Imagine what you might do or what your life might look like if you put that guy ahead of yourself.
[4608.86 --> 4611.86]  Is my intonation clear enough on what I'm intending there?
[4611.86 --> 4612.86]  Right?
[4612.86 --> 4617.86]  If you made even her, yeah, her, higher than you.
[4617.86 --> 4624.86]  Imagine what our life together would be like if we could do this.
[4624.86 --> 4635.86]  Now, notice that these descriptors of how you and I are supposed to be together start with something on the inside.
[4635.86 --> 4640.86]  It's a way of seeing each other before it is a way of doing certain things.
[4640.86 --> 4645.86]  It's about heart attitudes or gut attitudes to each other.
[4645.86 --> 4658.86]  And then second, notice that all of these attitudes, all of these ways of being in the world are supremely exemplified in the life and person of Jesus Christ himself.
[4658.86 --> 4659.86]  Right?
[4659.86 --> 4663.86]  This is the same point from the previous section because Peter has been building.
[4663.86 --> 4664.86]  Right?
[4664.86 --> 4669.86]  In this section, Jesus is held up as our example in all of these things.
[4669.86 --> 4670.86]  In chapter 2, verse 21,
[4670.86 --> 4679.86]  To this you were called because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example that you should follow in his footsteps.
[4679.86 --> 4680.86]  Right?
[4680.86 --> 4684.86]  Jesus is the truly harmonious one.
[4684.86 --> 4686.86]  He is the true and better sympathizer.
[4686.86 --> 4691.86]  He is the true and better brother who loved sacrificially unto death on the cross.
[4691.86 --> 4698.86]  Jesus is the true compassionate one whose gut was pierced for our transgressions.
[4698.86 --> 4703.86]  Jesus is the one who lived the life I should have lived and died the death that I deserve.
[4703.86 --> 4717.86]  Jesus is the one who three days later was raised and who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God with angels and authorities and powers in submission to him.
[4717.86 --> 4731.86]  Because he has done this, he now by grace through faith in the operation of the Holy Spirit makes you willing and ready from now on to live for him.
[4731.86 --> 4742.86]  Because Jesus did that for us, it changes the way that we see and be and interact with each other.
[4742.86 --> 4750.34]  And then Peter's second point is that it changes the way we see and be and interact with the pagan world around us.
[4752.60 --> 4756.82]  Who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good?
[4757.56 --> 4762.96]  But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed.
[4763.90 --> 4765.32]  Do not fear their threats.
[4766.38 --> 4767.22]  Do not be frightened.
[4767.22 --> 4779.12]  And Peter is saying, right, that when you do good, the world should see that and know.
[4780.16 --> 4788.80]  But even if they don't, or perhaps exactly when they don't, when it doesn't make sense to them,
[4788.86 --> 4793.40]  when it doesn't add up in the way that you want it to and it's supposed to,
[4793.40 --> 4799.44]  and they react negatively or they judge you or they accuse you of doing wrong,
[4799.50 --> 4802.08]  like he says in chapter 2 verse 11,
[4803.08 --> 4810.70]  even when that is your reality, you are blessed.
[4813.68 --> 4816.38]  When have you felt like suffering was a blessing?
[4818.68 --> 4820.58]  That's what Peter wants to invite you into.
[4820.58 --> 4825.96]  When have you felt afraid?
[4827.94 --> 4829.12]  Peter's saying, don't be.
[4830.54 --> 4835.58]  Because you have Jesus who went before you and is now in this with you.
[4836.88 --> 4839.24]  Instead, even when you're being accused of doing wrong,
[4839.40 --> 4840.90]  even when you're suffering,
[4841.10 --> 4844.50]  even when what you are doing doesn't make sense to the world,
[4845.50 --> 4850.34]  in your hearts, revere Christ as Lord.
[4851.40 --> 4855.78]  When you are revering Christ as Lord, these things will happen.
[4856.36 --> 4865.00]  And as they do, always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have.
[4866.04 --> 4868.02]  Always be prepared.
[4868.02 --> 4872.84]  Have a response ready for why do you do this?
[4874.18 --> 4875.22]  What is your,
[4875.38 --> 4877.40]  because the love of Christ compels me?
[4878.04 --> 4881.58]  What is your reason for being here right now?
[4881.58 --> 4886.00]  What is your reason for saying no to this event or that event?
[4886.06 --> 4890.56]  What is your reason for leaving that group of friends behind as God was getting a hold of your life?
[4890.64 --> 4894.06]  What is your reason for saying yes to Jesus?
[4894.06 --> 4900.30]  Always be prepared.
[4901.88 --> 4904.80]  Always be prepared.
[4905.66 --> 4911.32]  But do this with gentleness and respect.
[4911.32 --> 4925.84]  Some of us are unsure of how to give an answer or a reason for the hope that we have.
[4925.84 --> 4931.30]  And so we give more weight to the fear that we feel in that moment and don't say anything.
[4932.74 --> 4940.06]  And some of us, trying to give an answer, haven't quite figured out how to be gentle and respectful.
[4940.06 --> 4953.78]  And we become exactly what the culture is trying to make us in one of those two ways in combat with the other.
[4954.66 --> 4959.20]  We are offered here a third way.
[4959.20 --> 4971.28]  But again, even if you figure out this humility thing, even if you figure out this gentleness and respect thing,
[4971.28 --> 4979.08]  it is still possible to suffer for doing good and for doing evil.
[4980.72 --> 4984.32]  That suffering may yet still happen.
[4984.32 --> 4990.28]  But here, too, Christ is your example.
[4991.86 --> 4996.84]  For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God.
[4997.14 --> 5001.06]  He was put to death in the body but made alive in the spirit.
[5002.08 --> 5005.82]  He has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God.
[5005.82 --> 5005.86]  God.
[5005.86 --> 5015.12]  There is a war of cultural identity going on in the world right now.
[5015.64 --> 5022.68]  Whether it's left or right, progressive or conservative, it's in religion, it's in politics, it's local, and it's global.
[5022.84 --> 5025.30]  It is in social settings, and it's in families.
[5026.90 --> 5031.94]  God's word is telling us that we are something else.
[5032.46 --> 5034.68]  We are a third way.
[5034.68 --> 5037.46]  You are beloved of God.
[5037.58 --> 5041.14]  You are elect exiles, foreigners, and strangers.
[5041.40 --> 5043.70]  You are something else.
[5044.24 --> 5047.14]  And so, do not be afraid.
[5047.78 --> 5052.20]  Go and be something that the pagan world has never seen.
[5054.10 --> 5056.48]  Be like Jesus in the world.
[5057.60 --> 5058.62]  Do not be afraid.
[5058.62 --> 5066.78]  Even if you struggle or suffer because you are beloved of God, do not be afraid.
[5067.80 --> 5069.86]  You are his son.
[5070.54 --> 5072.86]  You are his daughter.
[5073.52 --> 5076.22]  Do not fear.
[5077.00 --> 5078.04]  Do not be frightened.
[5078.80 --> 5083.94]  But in your hearts, revere Christ as Lord.
[5083.94 --> 5087.36]  And everyone said, Amen.
[5088.08 --> 5088.96]  Let's pray together.
[5088.96 --> 5105.74]  Lord Jesus Christ, we revere you as Lord.
[5105.74 --> 5113.02]  And so, by your perfect love, remove our fears.
[5113.60 --> 5114.96]  That we might go.
[5116.04 --> 5122.20]  That we might go prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks for the reason, for the hope that we have.
[5122.74 --> 5125.26]  We might do this with gentleness and respect.
[5125.26 --> 5129.50]  And Lord God, send us out now.
[5130.54 --> 5134.26]  That we might together be like-minded in harmony.
[5134.76 --> 5139.18]  That we might be a model of sympathy for one another.
[5139.24 --> 5141.36]  That we might love one another as brothers and sisters.
[5141.36 --> 5142.94]  That we might be compassionate.
[5143.04 --> 5148.28]  That we might share in the feelings of way down deep in our cores.
[5148.28 --> 5153.40]  That we might be humbled together.
[5155.40 --> 5160.40]  Transform us into this kind of family.
[5163.68 --> 5168.42]  That though the world may accuse us of doing wrong, they may see our good deeds.
[5168.98 --> 5171.84]  That they may glorify you.
[5171.84 --> 5175.50]  Soli Deo Gloria.
[5175.72 --> 5179.12]  To the glory of God alone we pray.
[5180.44 --> 5181.02]  Amen.
[5201.84 --> 5215.10]  The mighty rock on which we're built.
[5215.10 --> 5220.58]  In every lie the truth is found.
[5221.44 --> 5226.12]  And every bridge with glowing air.
[5226.12 --> 5234.52]  Through faith alone we come to you.
[5234.52 --> 5240.12]  We have no merit we can take.
[5240.76 --> 5245.38]  Sure that your promises are true.
[5246.42 --> 5251.28]  We place our hope in Jesus' name.
[5252.18 --> 5253.18]  Gloria.
[5254.92 --> 5255.62]  Gloria.
[5256.12 --> 5258.06]  Gloria.

[5283.52 --> 5284.24]  Gloria.
[5284.24 --> 5284.48]  Gloria.
[5284.68 --> 5285.32]  Gloria.
[5285.32 --> 5285.54]  Gloria.
[5285.54 --> 5285.68]  Gloria.
[5285.68 --> 5285.72]  Gloria.
[5285.72 --> 5286.10]  Gloria.
[5286.10 --> 5286.12]  Gloria. Arc. Lauti. y. V.esen.angas pessoal.
[5286.12 --> 5292.12]  His righteousness is of our King
[5292.12 --> 5297.12]  Your lost demands are satisfied
[5297.12 --> 5303.12]  His perfect work has set us free
[5303.12 --> 5307.82]  Gloria, Gloria
[5307.82 --> 5314.12]  Glory to God alone
[5314.12 --> 5320.12]  Gloria, Gloria
[5320.12 --> 5326.12]  Glory to God alone
[5334.12 --> 5339.12]  By grace alone we have been saved
[5339.12 --> 5345.12]  All that we are has come from you
[5345.12 --> 5351.12]  Hearts that were once by sin enslave
[5351.12 --> 5356.12]  Now by your power has been made true
[5356.12 --> 5362.12]  Gloria, Gloria
[5362.12 --> 5368.12]  Glory to God alone
[5368.12 --> 5373.12]  Gloria, Gloria
[5373.12 --> 5379.12]  Glory to God alone
[5379.12 --> 5391.12]  And on this Reformation Day
[5391.12 --> 5397.12]  We join with saints of old to sing
[5397.12 --> 5403.12]  We lift our hearts as one in praise
[5403.12 --> 5408.12]  Glory to Christ our gracious King
[5408.12 --> 5414.12]  Gloria, Gloria
[5414.12 --> 5420.12]  Glory to God alone
[5420.12 --> 5425.12]  Gloria, Gloria
[5425.12 --> 5430.12]  Glory to God alone
[5430.12 --> 5436.12]  Gloria, Gloria
[5436.12 --> 5438.12]  Glory to God alone
[5438.12 --> 5441.12]  Gloria, Gloria
[5441.12 --> 5452.24]  Gloria, Gloria, glory to God alone.
[5452.24 --> 5473.40]  One of the beautiful legacies of the Reformation is the restoring of singing to the congregation
[5473.40 --> 5478.30]  and of singing to the church, not just a choir of professionals up front,
[5478.30 --> 5483.22]  but everybody singing in one voice together.
[5484.08 --> 5486.40]  And for that, we give thanks to God.
[5487.60 --> 5492.18]  There's also a more scarring legacy of the Reformation,
[5492.94 --> 5499.48]  in that the Reformation may also be the source of the greatest divisions that the Christian church has ever seen,
[5499.54 --> 5501.90]  and we live in that legacy as well.
[5502.12 --> 5506.86]  And so cognizant of that, we're going to end our service before receiving God's blessing
[5506.86 --> 5512.06]  by professing our shared faith together using the words of the Apostles' Creed.
[5513.06 --> 5513.26]  Right?
[5513.30 --> 5519.02]  A creed that has been spoken by the church in various forms since its near inception.
[5520.20 --> 5523.76]  And to be clear, the Apostles' Creed doesn't mean that it was written by the apostles,
[5524.02 --> 5528.00]  but that it accurately summarizes the teaching of the apostles.
[5528.00 --> 5534.54]  The creed that we have in its current form is a translation from a 7th century Latin creed
[5534.54 --> 5536.62]  that had earlier forms as well.
[5537.20 --> 5543.84]  But we reflect here on the disunity that has been caused by things like the Reformation
[5543.84 --> 5545.52]  and the selfishness of our own hearts,
[5545.88 --> 5550.22]  but also on the spiritual unity of the church Catholic,
[5550.60 --> 5553.50]  that is, all times and all places everywhere.
[5553.74 --> 5556.48]  That is our faith tradition.
[5556.48 --> 5561.74]  And so with one voice, we profess our shared faith.
[5562.52 --> 5568.24]  I believe in God the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
[5568.88 --> 5573.20]  I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,
[5573.92 --> 5578.34]  who was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary.
[5579.02 --> 5584.34]  He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.
[5584.34 --> 5586.40]  He descended to hell.
[5587.14 --> 5589.80]  Third day, he rose again from the dead.
[5590.50 --> 5596.00]  He ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.
[5596.70 --> 5600.38]  From there, he will come to judge the living and the dead.
[5600.38 --> 5605.58]  I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church,
[5606.34 --> 5609.86]  the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins,
[5610.44 --> 5614.14]  the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.
[5615.06 --> 5615.50]  Amen.
[5617.12 --> 5620.98]  Standing together, receive God's blessing.
[5620.98 --> 5626.74]  May God go before you to lead you.
[5627.44 --> 5629.82]  May God go behind you to guard you.
[5630.54 --> 5632.88]  May God go beneath you to support you.
[5633.14 --> 5635.76]  And may God go beside you to befriend you.
[5636.22 --> 5638.24]  Do not be afraid.
[5639.24 --> 5641.32]  Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[5641.72 --> 5643.56]  Do not be afraid,
[5643.56 --> 5649.32]  but go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
[5650.32 --> 5651.08]  Amen.
[5651.08 --> 5651.14]  Amen.
[5673.56 --> 5673.86]  shit below.
[5673.86 --> 5678.62]  P.
[5678.70 --> 5691.74]  END
