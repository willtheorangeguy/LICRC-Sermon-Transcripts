[0.00 --> 2.00]  I just need you
[2.00 --> 12.00]  Lord, I need you
[12.00 --> 20.10]  Yeah, I just need you
[20.10 --> 22.78]  Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
[22.78 --> 26.30]  I will fear no evil, for thou art with me
[26.30 --> 28.30]  Thy rod and thy staff
[28.30 --> 31.24]  They comfort me when I'm beat down, broken
[31.24 --> 33.54]  Hold my heart when it's split wide open
[33.54 --> 35.80]  Turn these eyes to my soul protector
[35.80 --> 38.38]  And break the will of this born defector
[38.38 --> 41.94]  Cause all I know, all I know
[41.94 --> 45.82]  Is you're my only hope
[45.82 --> 49.62]  When I'm up, when I'm down
[49.62 --> 51.86]  When the wolves come around
[51.86 --> 54.24]  When my feet hit the ground
[54.24 --> 57.14]  I just need, I just need you
[57.14 --> 58.86]  On my darkest days
[58.86 --> 61.12]  When I'm losing faith
[61.12 --> 63.60]  No, it ain't gonna change
[63.60 --> 66.38]  I just need, I just need you
[66.38 --> 75.82]  Lord, I need you
[75.82 --> 87.14]  When you pull me closer
[87.14 --> 88.96]  I come to life
[88.96 --> 91.76]  When you pull me closer
[91.76 --> 93.58]  I come to life
[93.58 --> 96.36]  When you pull me closer
[96.36 --> 98.18]  I come to life
[98.18 --> 102.74]  When you pull me closer, I come to life
[102.74 --> 105.14]  When I'm up, when I'm down
[105.14 --> 109.70]  When I'm down
[109.70 --> 114.64]  On my darkest days
[114.64 --> 119.08]  No, it ain't gon' change
[119.08 --> 122.00]  Oh, Lord, I need you
[122.00 --> 123.56]  When I'm up, when I'm down
[123.56 --> 125.90]  When the world's come around
[125.90 --> 127.74]  When I'm down
[127.74 --> 131.22]  Yeah, I need, I need, I need, I need you
[131.22 --> 132.68]  On my darkest days
[132.68 --> 134.40]  When I'm down
[134.40 --> 134.96]  When I'm down
[134.96 --> 135.68]  When I'm down
[135.68 --> 139.60]  Ain't no way this day gon' change
[139.60 --> 141.62]  It's you, I need
[141.62 --> 143.62]  It's you, I need
[143.62 --> 146.10]  On my darkest days
[146.10 --> 147.68]  When I'm losing faith
[147.68 --> 150.82]  I need you, I need
[150.82 --> 153.12]  It's you, I need
[153.12 --> 155.24]  Every single day
[155.24 --> 157.16]  Every breath I take
[157.16 --> 158.44]  I need you
[158.44 --> 163.28]  I need you
[163.28 --> 167.16]  Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[167.16 --> 197.14]  Thank you.
[197.16 --> 209.88]  To sing a new song to you who sits on heaven's mercy seat.
[212.38 --> 222.78]  Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, holy or mercy.
[227.16 --> 238.16]  To sing a new song to you who sits on heaven's mercy seat.
[238.16 --> 247.30]  Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty.
[248.06 --> 252.82]  Who was and is and is to come.

[338.98 --> 348.98]  You are holy
[348.98 --> 356.98]  Struggle wonder
[356.98 --> 359.98]  All struggle wonder
[359.98 --> 365.98]  At the mention of your name
[365.98 --> 370.98]  Jesus your name is power
[370.98 --> 374.98]  Bread for living water
[374.98 --> 379.98]  Son, tomorrow's mystery
[379.98 --> 384.98]  Holy, holy, holy
[384.98 --> 388.98]  The Son of God Almighty

[547.98 --> 577.96]  Thank you.
[577.98 --> 579.98]  Thank you.
[579.98 --> 581.98]  Thank you.
[581.98 --> 583.98]  Thank you.

[591.98 --> 593.98]  Thank you.
[593.98 --> 595.98]  Thank you.
[595.98 --> 597.98]  Thank you.
[597.98 --> 598.98]  Thank you.
[599.98 --> 603.98]  Thank you.
[603.98 --> 613.26]  Feel the darkness shaking, all the dead are coming back to life, back to life.
[613.98 --> 622.16]  Hear the song awaken, our creation singing we're alive, cause you're alive.
[623.24 --> 627.94]  You called me out of the grave, you called me into the light.
[627.94 --> 632.26]  You called my name and in my heart came alive.
[632.26 --> 642.06]  Your love is greater, your love is stronger, your love awakens, awakens, awakens me.
[642.26 --> 651.92]  Your love is greater, your love is stronger, your love awakens, awakens, awakens me.
[653.54 --> 658.72]  And what a love we've found, death can hold us down.
[658.72 --> 663.20]  We shout it out, we're alive, cause you're alive.
[663.24 --> 668.26]  And what a love we've found, death can hold us down.
[668.72 --> 672.74]  We shout it out, we're alive, cause you're alive.
[672.82 --> 678.04]  And what a love we've found, death can hold us down.
[678.04 --> 683.56]  We shout it out, we're alive, cause you're alive.
[687.56 --> 691.48]  Your love is greater, your love is stronger.
[692.04 --> 696.74]  Your love awakens, awakens, awakens me.
[696.88 --> 700.98]  Your love is greater, your love is stronger.
[700.98 --> 715.72]  Your love awakens, awakens, awakens me.
[715.72 --> 730.48]  Your love awakens, awakens, awakens me.
[734.48 --> 744.42]  Your love awakens, awakens, awakens me.
[744.42 --> 774.40]  Your love awakens, awakens me.
[774.40 --> 776.40]  Your love awakens, awakens me.
[776.40 --> 777.40]  Your love awakens, awakens me.
[777.40 --> 779.24]  The service is going to be a little bit different today
[779.24 --> 783.26]  as we include some of the GEMS in different ways by video.
[783.52 --> 786.52]  But Counselor Courtney is here with us this morning
[786.52 --> 788.12]  and we're really excited to have that
[788.12 --> 790.08]  and to share a little bit of what's going on
[790.08 --> 792.30]  in the GEMS program through her.
[793.14 --> 794.86]  Just two other announcements.
[795.12 --> 798.76]  One, a reminder, or maybe I'm informing you,
[798.82 --> 800.18]  I'm not sure, but youth,
[800.36 --> 802.36]  which was scheduled to happen tonight, 2020,
[802.36 --> 803.60]  has been canceled.
[804.12 --> 806.46]  And so there's an email in your inboxes
[806.46 --> 807.90]  from Pastor Kevin about that.
[807.98 --> 809.20]  And so make sure you check that.
[809.56 --> 810.30]  But hear it here.
[810.70 --> 812.28]  Youth for tonight is canceled
[812.28 --> 815.00]  and that will resume again with Real Talk
[815.00 --> 816.70]  in a week or so.
[817.50 --> 819.94]  Also, just want to encourage everyone
[819.94 --> 821.76]  and say thank you for the work that you're doing
[821.76 --> 822.48]  and treat tag.
[824.36 --> 824.80]  Excellent.
[825.42 --> 826.26]  Keep that up.
[826.34 --> 827.46]  We're hearing awesome stories
[827.46 --> 829.48]  and seeing really good things on social media
[829.48 --> 831.52]  as that starts to sort of snowball
[831.52 --> 834.12]  into a really amazing community event
[834.12 --> 835.38]  and experience together.
[836.30 --> 837.76]  We come together to worship God.
[838.24 --> 840.72]  He is here and he is present with you
[840.72 --> 842.28]  as you gather to worship him.
[842.34 --> 844.54]  And we mark that and we acknowledge that presence
[844.54 --> 846.44]  by receiving God's greeting.
[846.74 --> 848.18]  So I'm going to invite you, wherever you are,
[848.24 --> 851.28]  if you're sitting, maybe stand or hold your hands out
[851.28 --> 854.30]  to receive the greeting of our God.
[856.46 --> 858.00]  Grace to you and peace
[858.00 --> 860.46]  from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ,
[860.56 --> 862.02]  his Son and our Savior
[862.02 --> 865.22]  through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[866.16 --> 866.50]  Amen.
[867.08 --> 868.38]  Let's worship God in song together.
[873.04 --> 874.00]  Good morning.
[874.36 --> 875.44]  My name is Leslie
[875.44 --> 878.98]  and I'm going to give our call to worship this morning
[878.98 --> 882.64]  from Psalm 100, which is very familiar to us.
[884.02 --> 887.20]  Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth.
[887.66 --> 889.16]  Serve the Lord with gladness.
[890.08 --> 892.02]  Come into his presence with singing.
[893.16 --> 895.16]  Know that the Lord, he is God.
[895.74 --> 898.42]  It is he who made us and we are his.
[899.32 --> 903.18]  We are his people, the sheep of his pasture.
[904.26 --> 906.04]  Enter his gates with thanksgiving
[906.04 --> 907.66]  and his courts with praise.
[907.66 --> 909.46]  Give thanks to him.
[910.06 --> 910.86]  Bless his name.
[911.26 --> 912.82]  For the Lord is good.
[913.64 --> 915.96]  His steadfast love endures forever
[915.96 --> 918.98]  and his faithfulness to all generations.
[919.82 --> 921.12]  Join us in singing this morning.
[921.12 --> 922.12]  Thank you.
[922.12 --> 937.00]  My Jesus, my Savior,
[937.00 --> 939.38]  Lord, there is blood,
[939.38 --> 945.22]  I believe you are His.
[945.22 --> 949.00]  My Jesus, my Savior,
[949.00 --> 953.10]  Lord, there is blood like you.
[953.10 --> 958.36]  All of my days I want to praise
[958.36 --> 965.70]  the wonders of your mighty love.
[965.70 --> 980.16]  Let every breath, all that I have,
[980.16 --> 985.84]  never cease to worship you.
[985.84 --> 991.82]  Shout to the Lord on the earth, let us sing.
[991.82 --> 997.20]  Power and majesty, praise to the King.
[997.74 --> 1001.12]  Mountains bow down and the seas
[1001.12 --> 1007.12]  will roar at the sound of your name.
[1007.12 --> 1012.88]  I sing for joy at the wake of your hands.
[1013.52 --> 1018.22]  Forever I'll love you, forever I'll stand.
[1018.22 --> 1025.22]  Nothing compares to the promise I have in you.
[1029.62 --> 1034.38]  My Jesus, my Savior,
[1034.94 --> 1037.60]  Lord, there is none like you.
[1038.60 --> 1043.22]  All of my days I want to praise
[1043.22 --> 1050.22]  the wonders of your mighty love.
[1050.22 --> 1055.58]  I comfort, I shelter,
[1055.58 --> 1059.84]  tower of refuge and strength.
[1059.84 --> 1064.84]  That every breath, all that I am,
[1064.84 --> 1070.78]  never cease to worship you.
[1070.78 --> 1076.42]  Shout to the Lord on the earth, let us sing.
[1076.42 --> 1081.90]  Power and majesty, praise to the King.
[1082.54 --> 1086.26]  Mountains bow down and the seas will roar
[1086.26 --> 1091.70]  at the sound of your name.
[1092.98 --> 1097.50]  I sing for joy at the wake of your hands.
[1097.50 --> 1102.74]  Forever I'll love you, forever I'll stand.
[1102.74 --> 1107.96]  Nothing compares to the promise I have.
[1108.32 --> 1112.96]  Nothing compares to the promise I have.
[1113.20 --> 1120.10]  Oh, nothing compares to the promise I have in you.
[1127.50 --> 1132.16]  Lord, please join me in this confession and assurance of prayer.
[1135.74 --> 1137.70]  Gracious and merciful God,
[1138.50 --> 1141.82]  you know each of our hearts this morning.
[1142.58 --> 1144.48]  We come together as a congregation,
[1144.72 --> 1147.58]  but also as individuals with our own struggles
[1147.58 --> 1149.80]  and guilt that weigh on our hearts.
[1149.80 --> 1155.20]  Lord, each of us has had to deal with trials,
[1155.64 --> 1158.08]  challenges, temptations this past week.
[1159.18 --> 1162.00]  In some cases, we may not have responded well.
[1163.48 --> 1166.24]  We may have given in to our temptations
[1166.24 --> 1169.74]  or responded in anger or indifference to challenges.
[1170.74 --> 1173.98]  We may have gossiped or lied or cheated.
[1174.78 --> 1179.48]  We may have fallen very short of being salt and light in this world.
[1179.80 --> 1184.92]  We may have sinned, too, Lord, without even recognizing it.
[1186.54 --> 1187.92]  Don't forgive us.
[1189.76 --> 1194.32]  Dear Jesus, we are so thankful that you love us so much
[1194.32 --> 1197.32]  that you bore our sins and grief on the cross.
[1198.14 --> 1200.60]  We thank you that we can call on you
[1200.60 --> 1203.34]  and have the assurance of your forgiveness
[1203.34 --> 1205.80]  and life everlasting with you.
[1205.80 --> 1209.84]  Thank you that you call us your prayer.
[1211.14 --> 1213.48]  Thank you for your amazing love.
[1213.48 --> 1215.30]  Amen.
[1235.80 --> 1247.88]  I'm forgiven.
[1247.88 --> 1247.92]  I'm forgiven.
[1249.04 --> 1251.32]  Cause you were forsaken.
[1253.18 --> 1254.44]  I'm accepted.
[1255.82 --> 1257.64]  You were condemned.
[1259.54 --> 1261.98]  I'm alive and well.
[1261.98 --> 1265.00]  Your spirit is within me.
[1265.00 --> 1269.72]  Because you died and rose again.
[1272.72 --> 1274.10]  I'm forgiven.
[1275.10 --> 1277.46]  Cause you were forsaken.
[1279.54 --> 1280.68]  I'm accepted.
[1282.32 --> 1283.58]  You were condemned.
[1283.58 --> 1288.20]  I'm alive and well.
[1288.20 --> 1291.14]  Your spirit is within me.
[1291.14 --> 1296.46]  Because you died and rose again.
[1298.46 --> 1301.20]  Amazing love.
[1301.20 --> 1303.96]  How can it be
[1303.96 --> 1309.08]  That you, my King, would die for me?
[1309.08 --> 1314.46]  Amazing love.
[1314.46 --> 1316.96]  I know it's true.
[1318.76 --> 1322.36]  It's my joy to honor you.
[1322.36 --> 1329.06]  In all I do, I honor you.
[1329.06 --> 1329.46]  I'm forgiven.
[1329.46 --> 1329.62]  I'm forgiven.
[1329.62 --> 1331.72]  I'm forgiven.
[1331.72 --> 1333.56]  I'm forgiven.
[1334.90 --> 1336.72]  I'm forgiven.
[1337.86 --> 1340.02]  Cause you were forsaken.
[1341.62 --> 1343.28]  I'm accepted.
[1344.94 --> 1346.40]  You are forgiven.
[1348.52 --> 1350.86]  I'm alive and well.
[1350.98 --> 1353.54]  The spirit is within me.
[1353.54 --> 1359.38]  Because you died and rose again.
[1361.68 --> 1363.98]  Amazing love.
[1363.98 --> 1366.28]  I know it's true.
[1366.28 --> 1372.28]  It's my joy to honor you.
[1374.28 --> 1377.08]  Amazing love.
[1377.08 --> 1379.42]  I know it's true.
[1379.42 --> 1385.16]  It's my joy to honor you.
[1385.16 --> 1392.16]  In all I do, I honor you.
[1392.16 --> 1393.16]  I honor you.
[1397.16 --> 1401.66]  You are my King.
[1403.66 --> 1408.66]  You are my King.
[1408.66 --> 1415.40]  Jesus, you are my King.
[1416.40 --> 1422.12]  Jesus, you are my King.
[1424.46 --> 1426.40]  Amazing love.
[1426.40 --> 1429.40]  How can it be
[1429.40 --> 1434.50]  That you, my King, would die for me?
[1434.50 --> 1439.24]  Amazing love.
[1439.24 --> 1439.84]  Amazing love.
[1439.84 --> 1442.24]  I know it's true.
[1444.24 --> 1447.74]  It's my joy to honor you.
[1448.68 --> 1454.24]  In all I do, I honor you.
[1454.24 --> 1467.16]  Good morning, kids.
[1467.32 --> 1469.40]  It's great to be here this morning.
[1469.52 --> 1472.28]  And it's another great Sunday morning here.
[1472.36 --> 1472.68]  You know what?
[1472.70 --> 1475.26]  As I'm preparing for this children's worship time,
[1475.30 --> 1476.48]  I have a month to kind of prepare.
[1476.48 --> 1477.78]  I think about you guys often.
[1477.78 --> 1478.92]  And I sometimes wonder,
[1479.22 --> 1481.82]  the next time I see you guys,
[1481.82 --> 1483.68]  I'm wondering if I'm even going to recognize you.
[1483.74 --> 1484.54]  Because in a year,
[1484.66 --> 1486.20]  a lot of you kids change so much.
[1486.26 --> 1486.52]  You grow.
[1486.60 --> 1488.28]  I bet you a lot of you are getting a lot bigger.
[1488.70 --> 1489.98]  And they're starting to grow up.
[1490.14 --> 1492.44]  So that's going to be exciting for me to see
[1492.44 --> 1494.56]  how much you guys have changed in the last year.
[1496.00 --> 1497.14]  Today I got another video.
[1497.22 --> 1498.40]  So it's another exciting day.
[1498.40 --> 1499.84]  I spent some time on a video.
[1499.96 --> 1501.44]  So we're going to share that in a few moments.
[1501.50 --> 1503.90]  But first, we're going to have Nora
[1503.90 --> 1507.46]  share with you the memory verse.
[1509.92 --> 1512.44]  For God so loved the world
[1512.44 --> 1515.56]  that he gave his one and only son
[1515.56 --> 1518.52]  that whoever believes in him
[1518.52 --> 1520.94]  shall not perish,
[1521.48 --> 1523.92]  but have eternal life.
[1524.52 --> 1525.82]  John 3, 16.
[1528.40 --> 1529.42]  All right.
[1529.72 --> 1531.62]  I just want to thank Nora for that.
[1531.68 --> 1532.50]  That was a great job.
[1532.90 --> 1534.64]  Good job with the actions there.
[1534.84 --> 1535.68]  Thank you for doing that.
[1536.08 --> 1537.88]  So today my video is coming up.
[1538.20 --> 1541.40]  So we might as well just roll that right now
[1541.40 --> 1542.70]  because it's all in the video.
[1542.88 --> 1544.02]  So hope you enjoy it.
[1544.10 --> 1544.42]  Thank you.
[1545.42 --> 1546.26]  All right, kids.
[1547.40 --> 1548.52]  Here we are for another
[1548.52 --> 1550.00]  Children's Worship Time session.
[1550.16 --> 1551.82]  I'm sure glad to be able to do this
[1551.82 --> 1553.10]  with you guys again this month.
[1553.18 --> 1553.98]  It's been a long time
[1553.98 --> 1555.86]  since I've had a chance to talk to you guys.
[1555.86 --> 1556.80]  So here I am.
[1556.80 --> 1559.12]  Today is going to be a special day.
[1559.20 --> 1560.62]  We're doing a cool story today.
[1561.42 --> 1562.42]  Out in the country,
[1562.52 --> 1564.04]  I found a spot where I can do the story.
[1564.12 --> 1567.46]  The story today is about fish and sheep.
[1568.62 --> 1570.20]  And I thought,
[1570.30 --> 1572.34]  how am I going to share this story with you guys?
[1572.42 --> 1575.86]  So I was thinking of taking you guys fishing.
[1576.86 --> 1580.06]  But I don't know any good fishermen in my life.
[1580.10 --> 1582.66]  So I wasn't sure any of them could guarantee me
[1582.66 --> 1583.66]  that we could catch fish.
[1583.66 --> 1586.80]  But I do know some people that own some sheep and goats.
[1586.90 --> 1588.06]  So I thought that's a guarantee.
[1588.28 --> 1591.66]  So today's story is going to involve sheep.
[1592.02 --> 1593.14]  And we're going to show you some sheep.
[1594.02 --> 1594.98]  So today's story,
[1595.06 --> 1597.48]  we're going to go on a little bit of a field trip right today.
[1597.58 --> 1600.70]  And we're going to go visit Milner Valley Cheese.
[1600.82 --> 1602.56]  It's Farmgate Shop.
[1602.56 --> 1604.06]  And it's a goat farm.
[1605.90 --> 1606.70]  Like I was saying,
[1606.76 --> 1607.90]  we're at a goat farm here.
[1608.14 --> 1611.62]  And what they do at this farm is they milk the goats.
[1611.98 --> 1615.62]  And they make goat milk and goat cheese.
[1615.70 --> 1616.32]  And they sell that.
[1616.38 --> 1618.54]  It's a very successful small business.
[1619.22 --> 1621.08]  And they've allowed me to come here today
[1621.08 --> 1622.54]  to show you a bit about their farm.
[1622.66 --> 1623.78]  So we're going to go in there.
[1623.90 --> 1625.88]  They do most of their work with goats,
[1625.96 --> 1626.90]  but they do have some sheep.
[1627.00 --> 1628.64]  So that's kind of the connection to the story
[1628.64 --> 1629.88]  that we'll see some sheep today.
[1629.88 --> 1632.52]  So I'm going to go ahead and take you guys into the barn
[1632.52 --> 1634.76]  and do a little video with you there
[1634.76 --> 1637.44]  and share the story today from the Bible.
[1638.32 --> 1639.84]  Okay, so here we are at the farm.
[1639.94 --> 1642.30]  This building here is where they milk the cows
[1642.30 --> 1647.40]  and make the cheese and the milk that they sell.
[1647.62 --> 1649.02]  And then as we turn this way,
[1649.04 --> 1650.36]  we're going to head over to the barn.
[1650.68 --> 1651.94]  It's just a small barn,
[1652.06 --> 1653.40]  but it's kind of cool in there.
[1655.00 --> 1656.82]  There's quite a few goats in there.
[1658.12 --> 1659.40]  But they have some sheep.
[1659.40 --> 1660.38]  So here we go.
[1660.46 --> 1662.04]  We're going to come in, coming into the barn.
[1662.12 --> 1663.66]  You can start seeing some of them there.
[1664.92 --> 1666.28]  Here we are coming in.
[1667.62 --> 1672.84]  And these are all the goats they use for their business.
[1674.88 --> 1676.04]  And it's pretty cool.
[1676.04 --> 1679.62]  They're a little bit scared of people.
[1679.62 --> 1684.68]  But if you look back in the photo there,
[1684.76 --> 1688.96]  you can see there's a few sheep in the back there
[1688.96 --> 1692.54]  that are looking a little more hairy than the goats.
[1692.54 --> 1698.66]  They tell me that one of these sheep,
[1698.72 --> 1700.58]  I think that guy in the corner there,
[1700.66 --> 1702.72]  he's the nice one, and he likes to,
[1703.20 --> 1704.20]  he likes people.
[1704.34 --> 1708.04]  So I think he's going to be willing to take some of this hay from me here.
[1708.82 --> 1710.14]  You can see down there.
[1710.14 --> 1713.26]  Oh, even the goats are going at it here.
[1714.14 --> 1714.66]  Pretty good.
[1714.70 --> 1717.16]  But I'm going to try to get at this sheep here if I can.
[1718.76 --> 1719.54]  Where are you guys?
[1721.24 --> 1722.34]  And here's the sheep.
[1722.98 --> 1728.20]  He's just chowing down on this hay here that I got.
[1728.70 --> 1729.42]  And I'm feeding them.
[1731.04 --> 1732.00]  Goat's pretty good.
[1732.00 --> 1735.54]  They're all staring at me like,
[1735.64 --> 1736.52]  what are you doing here?
[1736.60 --> 1737.72]  I don't know who you are.
[1737.78 --> 1739.96]  So like I said to you, kids,
[1740.06 --> 1742.08]  I was telling you that the story today is about,
[1742.08 --> 1748.08]  the story today is about sheep and fish.
[1748.72 --> 1749.96]  And how the story starts is,
[1750.00 --> 1750.84]  I don't know if you remember,
[1750.84 --> 1753.00]  but over the last couple of weeks,
[1753.16 --> 1754.02]  Jesus has been,
[1755.72 --> 1757.26]  he was raised from the dead,
[1757.36 --> 1759.70]  and he showed himself to the kids
[1759.70 --> 1761.36]  as goats chewing on my elbow here.
[1761.44 --> 1761.74]  See that?
[1761.74 --> 1762.60]  Ow, jeepers.
[1763.76 --> 1767.02]  Jesus showed himself to the disciples in the house,
[1767.08 --> 1769.40]  and he shared himself with Thomas
[1769.40 --> 1773.36]  to show him the nail marks in his hands
[1773.36 --> 1775.22]  so that he believed that he was Jesus
[1775.22 --> 1776.32]  and he was Rose again.
[1777.16 --> 1778.34]  So where this story happens
[1778.34 --> 1780.02]  is the disciples are all hanging out,
[1780.78 --> 1782.78]  and they decide they're going to go fishing.
[1783.24 --> 1784.54]  So they decide,
[1784.62 --> 1785.72]  hey, let's go fishing tonight.
[1785.82 --> 1786.48]  We're going to go fishing.
[1786.58 --> 1787.82]  We're going to catch lots of fish,
[1787.90 --> 1790.34]  and it'll be a fun time together with the disciples,
[1790.34 --> 1791.84]  and we can just hang out like buddies.
[1791.94 --> 1793.36]  So they go out fishing for the night,
[1793.44 --> 1794.20]  and they get out there,
[1794.52 --> 1796.22]  and they fish all night long.
[1797.30 --> 1798.52]  And it gets to the morning,
[1798.58 --> 1799.82]  and they have caught nothing.
[1800.86 --> 1802.36]  And as they're getting close to shore,
[1802.44 --> 1803.84]  some guy on the shore says to them,
[1803.90 --> 1806.10]  hey, did you guys catch anything?
[1806.10 --> 1808.02]  And they're like, no, we didn't catch anything.
[1808.30 --> 1810.56]  And he says, hey, put your nets onto the other side
[1810.56 --> 1812.46]  and try that, the other side of the boat.
[1812.54 --> 1813.64]  So they go and do that,
[1814.36 --> 1817.00]  and sure enough, they catch a whole pile of fish.
[1819.10 --> 1823.92]  And the disciples recognize through conversation
[1823.92 --> 1825.96]  that this is Jesus that's on the shore.
[1825.96 --> 1828.96]  And Peter, the disciple Peter,
[1829.06 --> 1831.92]  who we've come to know over the many stories of last few,
[1832.00 --> 1834.88]  jumps overboard out of the boat and swims to shore
[1834.88 --> 1836.86]  because he wants to see Jesus so much.
[1837.10 --> 1838.38]  He wants to spend time with them.
[1838.74 --> 1840.18]  So as they got to the shore,
[1840.60 --> 1842.96]  as Peter got to shore and his disciples got to shore,
[1843.04 --> 1845.20]  they noticed that Jesus has built a little fire.
[1846.32 --> 1848.40]  And Jesus says to the disciples,
[1848.60 --> 1850.54]  why don't you bring me one of your fish,
[1850.62 --> 1852.40]  and I will make breakfast for you guys.
[1852.40 --> 1856.38]  So Jesus proceeded to make some breakfast out of the fish,
[1856.42 --> 1857.48]  and he gave them some bread,
[1857.60 --> 1859.44]  and they were able to eat their breakfast
[1859.44 --> 1860.78]  after a long day of fishing
[1860.78 --> 1862.24]  through the night of catching nothing.
[1867.16 --> 1870.68]  So after Jesus had served them breakfast,
[1871.38 --> 1873.10]  they were sitting around chit-chatting,
[1873.30 --> 1874.80]  and Jesus says to Peter,
[1874.94 --> 1876.80]  Peter, do you love me?
[1876.98 --> 1878.98]  And Peter responded, of course I do.
[1879.00 --> 1879.92]  I love you so much.
[1879.92 --> 1882.72]  And Jesus says to him, take care of my lambs.
[1883.60 --> 1884.64]  Feed my lambs.
[1885.68 --> 1888.32]  And then Jesus asked Peter a second time,
[1888.44 --> 1889.48]  Peter, do you love me?
[1889.56 --> 1891.40]  And Peter responded, yes, I do.
[1891.58 --> 1892.72]  I love you so much.
[1892.90 --> 1895.12]  And then Jesus says, take care of my sheep.
[1896.08 --> 1898.74]  And the third time, Jesus asked Peter,
[1899.18 --> 1900.52]  Peter, do you love me?
[1901.70 --> 1903.36]  And Peter was getting a little annoyed.
[1903.46 --> 1904.76]  He said, of course I do, Father.
[1904.84 --> 1905.76]  I love you so much.
[1906.02 --> 1908.70]  And Jesus responds to him, feed my sheep.
[1908.70 --> 1914.34]  I'll take a few minutes here to talk a little bit about the story,
[1914.42 --> 1920.30]  but I'm going to give you a little bit more video of these cool sheep and goats here in the barn.
[1920.30 --> 1921.84]  So here are more of the goats.
[1921.98 --> 1922.56]  They're sitting there.
[1922.62 --> 1923.26]  They're hanging out.
[1923.40 --> 1927.04]  Some of them are relaxing, taking a load off.
[1927.04 --> 1934.42]  Here's these little guys, goats down here, chowing on this hay that we got here.
[1934.42 --> 1940.34]  I was thinking about jumping into the pen with these sheep.
[1940.50 --> 1941.44]  Do you think I should do it?
[1941.52 --> 1943.34]  Or do you think it's a bad idea?
[1944.10 --> 1945.14]  I think I might try.
[1945.22 --> 1945.58]  Here I go.
[1945.64 --> 1948.54]  I'm going to try jumping into here with these goats and see what happens.
[1949.82 --> 1951.52]  I'm going into the goat pen here.
[1951.52 --> 1954.08]  And they're all running away from me.
[1954.84 --> 1955.72]  But here's my friend.
[1955.80 --> 1958.64]  Look at the guy with the red collar.
[1958.78 --> 1960.44]  Oh, these goats are coming close to me.
[1960.54 --> 1961.12]  They're all coming.
[1961.22 --> 1962.04]  They're all checking me out.
[1962.94 --> 1964.84]  I think this might be a bad idea.
[1964.96 --> 1966.24]  I think I'm going to try to get out.
[1966.46 --> 1970.42]  Because if they stomp me, will anybody ever find me?
[1970.42 --> 1975.78]  Before I leave here, I thought I would show you.
[1975.82 --> 1979.52]  There's a few little baby goats sitting in the corner here.
[1979.64 --> 1980.74]  Aren't they cute little things?
[1980.84 --> 1982.28]  Wouldn't you like to take one of them home?
[1983.30 --> 1986.22]  I'm sure your mom and dad would love having one of them running around the house.
[1986.40 --> 1987.10]  Oh, here comes.
[1988.14 --> 1991.70]  Mama's saying, give me some luck for our stay away from my babies.
[1993.70 --> 1995.32]  There's a guy right here too.
[1996.10 --> 1997.44]  A couple little ones there.
[1998.54 --> 1999.40]  Cute little guys.
[2000.42 --> 2006.46]  So I'm back here at my place.
[2006.56 --> 2007.64]  We're in a greenhouse here.
[2007.96 --> 2010.60]  I thought this would be a good place to talk a bit about the story.
[2012.62 --> 2017.86]  It's an interesting story because in the story, Jesus asked Peter three times if he loves him.
[2018.48 --> 2020.92]  And each time Peter responds, yes, I do love me.
[2020.98 --> 2024.58]  And Jesus makes some kind of reference to feed my sheep or take care of my sheep.
[2024.94 --> 2029.28]  But it's also interesting, kids, that remember a while back,
[2029.28 --> 2032.10]  and the stories were before Jesus was crucified.
[2032.10 --> 2034.56]  Peter was sitting around a fire with a bunch of people.
[2034.74 --> 2038.88]  And three times, the three times he denied that he knew Jesus.
[2039.04 --> 2043.66]  And here in this story, Jesus is asking Peter three times, do you love me?
[2044.04 --> 2046.54]  And each time Peter says, yes, I do love you.
[2046.54 --> 2049.92]  And Jesus encourages him to please feed my sheep.
[2050.36 --> 2057.82]  So it's interesting here that even though Peter denied Jesus those three times,
[2058.10 --> 2064.24]  Jesus still has a lot of faith in him and realizes that if his kingdom and his work on earth is going to continue,
[2064.24 --> 2068.26]  he needs Peter to do it because he was obviously a passionate guy.
[2069.52 --> 2074.40]  And Jesus could see that his kingdom would grow through Peter.
[2074.52 --> 2078.04]  So this is an awesome story where there's a little bit of redemption here for Peter,
[2078.12 --> 2082.60]  even though he may have made a poor decision about denying Jesus earlier.
[2082.60 --> 2087.26]  But now he's able to ask for forgiveness and to recommit himself to Jesus
[2087.26 --> 2090.48]  and to go ahead from this point on to further his kingdom.
[2091.36 --> 2092.84]  So it's kind of a great story.
[2092.98 --> 2094.94]  Hope you had a good time with me this morning.
[2095.52 --> 2097.52]  And I'm not sure what you're doing after this story,
[2097.60 --> 2103.52]  but maybe you're doing some crafts or some other coloring or other things for children's worship time.
[2103.60 --> 2105.10]  But I hope you have a great day.
[2105.18 --> 2108.12]  Let me just pray with you guys before you go your way.
[2108.12 --> 2109.88]  And let's do that.
[2110.04 --> 2111.90]  Heavenly Father, thank you so much for this day.
[2112.02 --> 2112.96]  Thank you for the kids.
[2113.10 --> 2114.22]  Even though we can't see them,
[2114.74 --> 2118.38]  I'm thankful that we could do these kind of stories with them and they could share.
[2131.56 --> 2131.96]  Hello.
[2132.64 --> 2133.34]  I'm Courtney.
[2133.34 --> 2139.22]  And I am the coordinator for the Langley-Emmanuel CRC's GEMS program.
[2139.88 --> 2142.54]  GEMS stands for Girls Everywhere Meeting the Savior.
[2143.30 --> 2150.86]  And its vision is to see girls around the world actively and enthusiastically expressing love for God and others.
[2151.60 --> 2157.04]  Girls equipped, motivated, and passionately engaged in living out their faith.
[2157.04 --> 2164.36]  The mission of GEMS is to bring girls everywhere into a living, dynamic relationship with Jesus Christ.
[2165.38 --> 2173.40]  The Langley-Emmanuel GEMS does this through Bible study, badges, crafts, conversations, and so much more.
[2174.36 --> 2180.58]  We currently have eight leaders and 28 girls, ranging in ages from grades 3 to grade 7.
[2180.58 --> 2188.86]  This year, our theme has been friended, which is centered around the fact that Jesus is the perfect friend,
[2189.36 --> 2192.66]  and that by turning to him and learning to be more like him,
[2192.98 --> 2198.00]  we can in turn show our love, his love for us through our relationships.
[2198.00 --> 2207.10]  I have called you friends for everything that I have learned from God that I have made from you.
[2207.10 --> 2208.60]  John 1515.
[2214.80 --> 2217.68]  Girls, what does the Lord require of you?
[2218.98 --> 2223.78]  To act justly, to love mercy, and to walk through our God.
[2223.78 --> 2224.92]  6 verse 8.
[2224.92 --> 2225.42]  6 verse 8.
[2228.00 --> 2256.14]  Everybody knows heartbreak, isolation.
[2256.14 --> 2263.14]  But we can lay our burdens down.
[2263.14 --> 2267.14]  Lay our burdens down.
[2267.14 --> 2268.14]  Lay our burdens down.
[2268.14 --> 2272.14]  What a friend we have in Jesus.
[2273.14 --> 2275.14]  He's to his mind.
[2275.14 --> 2276.78]  Sins are gone.
[2277.14 --> 2281.34]  I see grace on every horizon.
[2281.34 --> 2286.34]  And forever and ever as hard as my home.
[2286.34 --> 2290.34]  Hey, yeah.
[2290.34 --> 2296.34]  Everybody has fears.
[2296.34 --> 2298.34]  Everybody got worried.
[2298.34 --> 2303.34]  Everybody knows sorrow, devastation.
[2303.34 --> 2305.34]  Everybody knows sorrow, devastation.
[2305.34 --> 2307.34]  Everybody knows sorrow, devastation.
[2310.34 --> 2314.34]  But we can lay our burdens down.
[2314.34 --> 2315.34]  Lay our burdens down.
[2315.34 --> 2316.34]  Lay our burdens down.
[2316.34 --> 2317.34]  Lay our burdens down.
[2317.34 --> 2319.34]  Lay our burdens down.
[2319.34 --> 2321.34]  What a friend we have in Jesus.
[2321.34 --> 2323.34]  He's to his mind.
[2323.34 --> 2325.34]  He's to his mind.
[2325.34 --> 2326.34]  He's to his mind.
[2326.34 --> 2327.34]  Sins are gone.
[2327.34 --> 2330.34]  I see grace on every horizon.
[2330.34 --> 2337.34]  And forever and ever as hard as my home.
[2337.34 --> 2339.34]  No more betrayal.
[2339.34 --> 2341.34]  For he is faithful.
[2341.34 --> 2348.34]  He fills me up and my cup run is over.
[2348.34 --> 2350.34]  No more betrayal.
[2350.34 --> 2352.34]  For he is faithful.
[2352.34 --> 2356.34]  How he has proven it over and over.
[2356.34 --> 2358.34]  No more betrayal.
[2358.34 --> 2361.34]  For he is faithful.
[2361.34 --> 2365.34]  He fills me up and my cup run is over.
[2365.34 --> 2367.34]  No more betrayal.
[2367.34 --> 2369.34]  For he is faithful.
[2369.34 --> 2371.34]  For he is faithful.
[2371.34 --> 2373.34]  Over and over.
[2373.34 --> 2374.34]  Over and over.
[2374.34 --> 2375.34]  And no more.
[2375.34 --> 2379.34]  What a friend we have in Jesus.
[2379.34 --> 2383.34]  East to west my sins are gone.
[2383.34 --> 2388.34]  I see grace on every horizon.
[2388.34 --> 2393.34]  And forever and ever as hard as my home.
[2393.34 --> 2396.34]  What a friend we have in Jesus.
[2396.34 --> 2400.34]  East to west my sins are gone.
[2400.34 --> 2401.34]  Yes.
[2401.34 --> 2405.34]  I see grace on every horizon.
[2405.34 --> 2410.34]  And forever and ever as hard as my home.
[2410.34 --> 2414.34]  Forever and ever as hard as my home.
[2414.34 --> 2416.34]  Forever and ever as hard as my home.
[2426.34 --> 2431.34]  The offering today is for the GEMS Ministry of North America.
[2431.34 --> 2434.34]  This money is used to run GEMS on a larger scale.
[2434.34 --> 2436.34]  So it helps to develop curriculum.
[2436.34 --> 2440.34]  To provide staff to support the various clubs.
[2440.34 --> 2444.34]  To help spread the word of GEMS.
[2444.34 --> 2447.34]  And to help start new clubs as well.
[2447.34 --> 2449.34]  And so much more.
[2449.34 --> 2451.34]  Please give generously as God has given us.
[2451.34 --> 2463.34]  All right.
[2463.34 --> 2467.34]  Thank you Courtney for sharing that with us.
[2467.34 --> 2468.34]  That was great.
[2468.34 --> 2469.34]  Thank you for doing that.
[2469.34 --> 2476.34]  Just an addition to the givings is for next Sunday.
[2476.34 --> 2478.34]  The next offering is for New Ground.
[2478.34 --> 2480.34]  Formerly known as Operation Manna.
[2480.34 --> 2483.34]  New Ground is one of our diaconal ministries.
[2483.34 --> 2489.34]  They provide seed money to help churches start or grow meaningful and sustainable community ministries.
[2489.34 --> 2496.34]  So if you will prayerfully consider that for our next week's offering.
[2496.34 --> 2500.34]  A couple things I want to, as I segue into the congregational prayer.
[2500.34 --> 2505.34]  We've had a number of births in our baby births in our community here.
[2505.34 --> 2510.34]  So we have a picture to put up on the screen there for you guys to see the new babies.
[2510.34 --> 2512.34]  I know normally we get a chance to see them in church here.
[2512.34 --> 2518.34]  But due to the current situation, we get to at least see a picture of them on the screen.
[2518.34 --> 2519.34]  So that's fantastic.
[2519.34 --> 2528.34]  Congratulations to the Howlings, the Mullers, and the Pullmans on the birth of your babies.
[2528.34 --> 2534.34]  Please try, if you have a chance, to reach out to them and ask them if they need any help or with anything.
[2534.34 --> 2542.34]  If you'd like to make a meal for them, Rika Emmons has kind of been in charge of that part of the ministry.
[2542.34 --> 2545.34]  So if you could do that, that would be great.
[2545.34 --> 2551.34]  Before I get into the congregational prayer, I just kind of wanted to share a few thoughts that I've had over the last little while.
[2551.34 --> 2558.34]  And I spent a little bit of time on the road recently doing deliveries for work and stuff, and it allowed my mind to wander.
[2558.34 --> 2564.34]  And as most do, I think about our world and how we're living in it today, this COVID world.
[2564.34 --> 2570.34]  I'm not sure you think the same as me, but I feel like the world is very strange right now.
[2570.34 --> 2575.34]  There are those who are getting really sick during this time, yet others only have a few symptoms.
[2575.34 --> 2587.34]  We are given a huge blessing of new babies coming into our community, but yet grandparents and family and community cannot enjoy the full experience of this new baby.
[2587.34 --> 2592.34]  We have youth that are excited about new opportunities with school and relationships and jobs.
[2592.34 --> 2600.34]  But at the same time, we hear more and more incidents of anxiety, eating disorders, mental health for our youth.
[2600.34 --> 2609.34]  There are adults who have lost jobs and businesses, and businesses that struggle to pay the bills, while other businesses are thriving during this time.
[2609.34 --> 2619.34]  There are young people planning on marriages and lives together, despite the restrictions, while many marriages are struggling during this time.
[2619.34 --> 2627.34]  We all have close family and friends that have passed away, and we cannot get together to honour them and celebrate the life they lived among us.
[2627.34 --> 2636.34]  In the Bible, it says that we are to trust Him, not a hair falls from our head without His knowing about it, and that He loves us and cares for us.
[2636.34 --> 2640.34]  Sometimes it's hard to see that right now, for many.
[2640.34 --> 2646.34]  Sometimes I think I would like to stop by God's office, knock on His door and say,
[2646.34 --> 2649.34]  you know this COVID thing we have going on right now?
[2649.34 --> 2654.34]  You said don't worry about anything, and you have a plan and everything will be okay in the end?
[2654.34 --> 2657.34]  I'd like to follow that up with God.
[2657.34 --> 2659.34]  Can you run that by me again?
[2659.34 --> 2663.34]  And explain it to me again, because I'm having my doubts right now.
[2663.34 --> 2665.34]  But that's what faith is, right?
[2665.34 --> 2672.34]  Let's pray, trusting and following and doing our best in this world, and let God worry about the big things.
[2672.34 --> 2674.34]  Let's join together in prayer.
[2674.34 --> 2681.34]  Heavenly Father, we are grateful to be here today to worship you with our greater community, watching from home.
[2681.34 --> 2688.34]  As we take time on this day to reflect on our lives and rest, we are comforted by the turning of the seasons.
[2688.34 --> 2698.34]  Despite all the chaos that seems to be around us, we can see your steady hand at the wheel, when the flowers and the shrubs come to life with the start of spring.
[2698.34 --> 2702.34]  We are grateful for the trees that are pushing out their leaves and bulbs are popping out of the ground.
[2702.34 --> 2705.34]  Thank you for this reminder of your great power.
[2705.34 --> 2710.56]  we have words of thanksgiving Lord for the healthy births of new babies in our church
[2710.56 --> 2715.04]  we celebrate with the Pullmans the Mullers and the Howlings with the new additions to their families
[2715.04 --> 2722.64]  exciting times and lots of work but great rewards we thank you Lord for Miriam Visser's successful
[2722.64 --> 2728.36]  surgery a while back and that she is recovering nicely at home we pray for Clarence Stamm as he
[2728.36 --> 2733.26]  repairs for knee surgery in the next few days we pray that all goes well with the operation
[2733.26 --> 2738.30]  Lord we do not want to forget those in our community who have lost loved ones and the
[2738.30 --> 2743.60]  difficulties that having a loved one missing can bring we think of the Alexander family the Cools
[2743.60 --> 2749.10]  and the Boats please let these families feel your presence so they can lean on you in times of need
[2749.10 --> 2755.26]  it seems Lord as as these new variants of COVID enter our country more and more of us are getting
[2755.26 --> 2761.66]  the virus we pray for those in our church that have the virus and are recovering I think now we all
[2761.66 --> 2766.70]  know someone who has gotten the virus and we pray that the recovery and return to regular regular life
[2766.70 --> 2773.54]  is going smoothly as the hospitals fill with the sick we ask that you give strength and discernment
[2773.54 --> 2779.72]  to our hospital professionals as they care for all those who need help and care we ask for strength for
[2779.72 --> 2785.72]  those who still need to pull through the symptoms of this virus this virus Lord has created a lot of
[2785.72 --> 2792.76]  collateral damage we hear of more and more broken and hurting relationships vast references to loneliness
[2792.76 --> 2799.52]  we hear of the rise in mental health challenges among all ages especially the youth Lord give us strength
[2799.52 --> 2804.58]  and wisdom to be a source of strength for those looking for refuge and encouragement and for those
[2804.58 --> 2811.48]  that need help I pray that help is easy to find Lord it seems like we are at the mercy of our civic leaders
[2811.48 --> 2816.84]  with the decisions they have to make each day I too ask that you arm them with wisdom and discernment
[2816.84 --> 2822.52]  to make sound and wise decisions for us all these decisions are difficult and my prayers that they
[2822.52 --> 2829.88]  seek wisdom from you as they navigate the course for us we are thankful that the kids have been able to
[2829.88 --> 2836.20]  attend school regularly this year as the virus spreads that may not be an option anymore give our kids
[2836.20 --> 2841.40]  strength to press on through the challenges at school or if needed the challenges of learning from home and
[2841.40 --> 2847.16]  all that goes along with that process as it crows up this prayer Lord it is easy to focus on the
[2847.16 --> 2852.84]  negatives but we need to enjoy and reflect on the good things we have going on in our lives we give
[2852.84 --> 2859.56]  thanks for going for walks and enjoying nature having the freedom to still do church the abundance of food
[2859.56 --> 2866.12]  that we can enjoy for most of us we still have good jobs to go to the coming of summer and the outdoor
[2866.12 --> 2870.68]  activities that go along with that and a whole host of other blessings we can reflect on
[2872.12 --> 2878.52]  this reminds me of song lord that we sang often as kids we need to trust and obey for there's no other
[2878.52 --> 2894.12]  way to be happy in jesus and to trust and obey help us all to trust you honor you and be a light for you in this world amen
[2896.12 --> 2906.12]  we're going to come together and spend some time in god's word we're going to focus on what has been
[2906.12 --> 2912.52]  the gems theme verse from john 15 verse 15 but i'm going to read that in its context and so if you have
[2912.52 --> 2919.00]  a bible encourage you to open that up uh turn it on if it's on your phone or wherever uh and follow along
[2919.00 --> 2925.64]  in first in john 15 i'll start at verse 9 and then i'll read through to verse 17
[2928.52 --> 2939.40]  as the father has loved me so have i loved you now remain in my love if you keep my commands you remain
[2939.40 --> 2944.76]  in my love just as i have kept my father's commands and remain in his love
[2944.76 --> 2952.68]  i have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete
[2954.20 --> 2963.00]  my command is this love each other as i have loved you greater love has no one than this to lay down
[2963.00 --> 2971.48]  one's life for one's friends you are my friends if you do what i command i no longer call you servants
[2971.48 --> 2976.60]  because a servant does not know his master's business instead i have called you friends
[2976.60 --> 2981.56]  for everything that i have learned from my father i have made known to you
[2983.64 --> 2991.72]  you did not choose me but i chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit fruit that will
[2991.72 --> 3000.84]  last and so that whatever you ask in my name the father will give you this is my command love each other
[3002.04 --> 3002.76]  the word of the lord
[3006.60 --> 3014.20]  when i was in high school which is actually further back now than i really realized as i was
[3014.20 --> 3019.64]  reflecting on this story this past week but when i was in high school we had a keyboarding class
[3020.44 --> 3026.44]  now that probably dates me but i want to be clear that it doesn't date me so much as someone who
[3026.44 --> 3032.28]  had a keyboarding class that was actually on a typewriter and i see hands up exactly all right
[3032.28 --> 3037.48]  we at least had a computer now if you're listening and you don't know what a typewriter is
[3038.60 --> 3041.16]  call grandma and grandpa after the service and they will tell you
[3043.16 --> 3049.00]  now i don't know how they still teach keyboarding i know that they do and in fact my three-year-old
[3049.00 --> 3056.04]  daughter has keyboarding class in her school but when i was taking keyboarding we learned all about
[3056.04 --> 3061.24]  home row right you learned what fingers went on what keys and which ones you use to type what letter
[3061.24 --> 3066.76]  which thumb you were supposed to use to hit the space bar you learned all the proper techniques and
[3066.76 --> 3073.56]  tips for typing and doing so quickly and in that class in high school the goal was to be able to type
[3073.56 --> 3080.84]  accurately and to type quickly and to pass the class you had to type at least 40 words per minute
[3081.56 --> 3091.00]  at a 95 accuracy now for fun i did an online test this week to check out my typing and i type at 68
[3091.00 --> 3096.92]  words per minute with 98 accuracy now i'm not bragging because that's actually not a very good number for
[3096.92 --> 3102.52]  those who type professionally but i can tell you this i had pastor kevin do the same test and he types at
[3102.52 --> 3109.16]  45 words per minute also with a 98 accuracy so he would barely pass the class that i had in high
[3109.16 --> 3116.52]  school so at least i'm better than that anyways why do i bring this up and what is what is the point
[3117.16 --> 3122.92]  in that class one of the ways that they would test your speed and your accuracy was to have you type a
[3122.92 --> 3130.12]  series of sentences and i'll never forget it but one of those sentences that i had to type over and over
[3130.12 --> 3137.56]  and over again over the course of that class was this the only way to have a friend is to be one
[3138.76 --> 3145.00]  the only way to have a friend is to be one and that line has stuck with me for 25 years
[3145.88 --> 3151.88]  right 25 years later that's still in my brain and i didn't learn that until this past week actually
[3151.88 --> 3158.68]  but that line the only way to have a friend is to be one is a quote from 19th century american
[3158.68 --> 3166.04]  poet and essayist ralph waldo emerson it's part of a work that he wrote an essay he wrote called friendship
[3166.68 --> 3173.72]  and it's part of a larger quote that says the only reward for virtue is virtue the only way to have a
[3173.72 --> 3182.52]  friend is to be one so this morning taking inspiration from that quote and from that memory which stuck
[3182.52 --> 3190.52]  with me forever and i hope uh what i say can stick with you for half as long and then reading this idea
[3190.52 --> 3199.16]  through the gems theme verse from john 15 15 which says i have called you friends for everything i have
[3199.16 --> 3208.12]  learned from my father i have made known to you this morning i would like us to reflect on this idea
[3209.56 --> 3218.20]  the idea that having jesus as your friend makes you a better friend to each other
[3219.56 --> 3227.40]  but that the best way to have friends is to have jesus as your first friend right when jesus comes first
[3227.40 --> 3235.88]  the rest can follow and so our idea is that having jesus as your friend makes you a better friend to others
[3241.48 --> 3242.20]  and i get it
[3245.24 --> 3255.24]  i know that it is hard to be a kid right now and not just because of covid though that's not making it any
[3255.24 --> 3263.80]  easier right when i was a kid the world was so big and so full of possibility and imagination and so
[3263.80 --> 3267.96]  out there but now 12 year old kids carry the world in their pockets
[3269.48 --> 3275.00]  right the world is smaller and more immediately present right you don't go outside to find the
[3275.00 --> 3279.56]  world anymore you don't go outside to find trouble today the world and all its challenges and troubles and
[3279.56 --> 3284.92]  fears and fears and scary places has made its way inside of our homes and we hold it in our hands
[3288.28 --> 3291.32]  and i get it kids can be mean
[3293.80 --> 3299.24]  and to be honest that's always been true right and adults can be just as mean
[3300.92 --> 3304.20]  but what's different now is that you can't escape it
[3304.20 --> 3309.40]  right it used to be that you could go home from school and you would leave the kid who was bugging
[3309.40 --> 3316.68]  you at school but now that follows you it used to be that you could go home from work but now that
[3316.68 --> 3323.88]  follows you and it's with you wherever you go and don't hear what i'm not saying right i'm not i'm not
[3323.88 --> 3329.40]  against technology and i'm not trying to tell you how you should give or when you should give your
[3329.40 --> 3335.08]  kids a phone or some sort of device a computer or access to all of that right you've got rules and
[3335.08 --> 3339.96]  you've got wisdom for that as parents but don't get me wrong i've got really strong opinions and ideas
[3339.96 --> 3344.92]  about what that ought to be like and what it means to be a tech wise family and i think that's one of
[3344.92 --> 3352.12]  the most important things that we have as a job for us as those of us who are parents to do that well with our kids today
[3352.12 --> 3362.60]  the point that i want to just land here on is that it's just hard to be a kid it's hard to be safe
[3363.48 --> 3370.52]  right in our hyper connected culture and time people are terrified of genuine connection they're
[3370.52 --> 3377.16]  terrified to to reveal their real selves in our super connected culture people are feeling more lonely
[3377.16 --> 3384.76]  than ever and kids and families with things like texting or dming or snapchatting or tick tock or
[3384.76 --> 3390.28]  instagram or whatever the new social platform is right there's this pressure that exists in every
[3390.28 --> 3397.32]  area of our lives to curate it to a particular image of dixie d'amelio or olivia rodrigo right to
[3397.32 --> 3403.00]  to send a snap in the mirror because some boy asked you to do it or to trust that your friends are not going
[3403.00 --> 3407.56]  to take something that you've told them and then just put it out to the whole discord group right
[3407.56 --> 3409.16]  all of this comes together
[3412.12 --> 3421.56]  and we feel so lonely and isolated and left out there's countless statistics out there to prove
[3421.56 --> 3425.88]  this and you know i have statistics from the canadian mental health association from
[3426.44 --> 3432.76]  unicef canada from the vancouver hospital and their children's health association but the what you need to
[3432.76 --> 3438.76]  hear is that one in four kids have expressed a feeling of loneliness or isolation and in fact
[3438.76 --> 3441.00]  if you're talking about just girls that's one in three
[3443.88 --> 3451.56]  and that's before this pandemic came in place it's only gotten worse as a result of that because here
[3451.56 --> 3456.12]  we have to for the health and well-being of our friends and family and neighbors we have to isolate
[3456.12 --> 3465.00]  we have to be physically distant we have to have smaller and smaller bubbles this is our reality this is
[3465.00 --> 3470.76]  our context and it is hard and it is lonely and it can be scary
[3474.28 --> 3482.52]  and to our tears and to our anxieties and to our fears and to our broken hearts jesus speaks
[3482.52 --> 3491.56]  jesus is speaking the truth of his gospel into the everyday stuff of our life and that is really
[3491.56 --> 3498.36]  what gems has been about this year for these girls to be honest that's really what all of this is about
[3498.36 --> 3507.08]  what jesus is about for all of us this year and every year right to those who feel lost jesus says i have
[3507.08 --> 3515.48]  found you to those who are afraid jesus says i have overcome to those who are crying jesus says i will
[3515.48 --> 3522.92]  cry with you to those whose life has been turned upside down jesus says i will hold on to you to those who
[3522.92 --> 3535.08]  are alone jesus says i will never leave you to those who are looking for a place to belong jesus says i am yours and you are mine
[3535.08 --> 3550.52]  mine here is your home jesus says i have called you friends jesus is changing our relationships jesus is
[3550.52 --> 3559.40]  changing our stories jesus is changing who you are and how you relate to god now these words of jesus that
[3559.40 --> 3567.48]  we read are part of a a bigger discussion that he is having with his disciples takes place in john 15
[3567.48 --> 3574.36]  and in the chapters that surround it and that bigger discussion jesus presents himself as the true vine
[3575.00 --> 3581.80]  right that it's this is what it means to be connected to him he is the vine we are the branches and as
[3581.80 --> 3591.88]  tightly as a branch is connected to the vine so too uh are we connected to jesus that's the gospel right
[3591.88 --> 3599.08]  that's the the good news that jesus takes you he wraps his arms of love and grace around you and by faith
[3599.08 --> 3608.20]  he connects you to himself but that's what faith is right faith is the thing that unites us to jesus faith is
[3608.20 --> 3615.96]  the belief in his word and plan in his life and work faith is trusting that what he says is true and that
[3615.96 --> 3625.80]  living by faith is the best way to live faith is the line that that binds us to jesus and more importantly
[3626.60 --> 3634.84]  faith is the line that binds jesus to us and the bible tells us over and over again that faith
[3634.84 --> 3642.68]  is a gift perhaps no more explicitly than in ephesians 2 paul writes for it is by grace you have been saved
[3642.68 --> 3652.60]  through faith and this is not from yourselves it is the gift of god right god gives the gift of faith
[3652.60 --> 3660.44]  and all you have to do is need it right the only thing we do in this exchange is recognize our need
[3660.44 --> 3668.12]  for him right every person has that need but not every person recognizes that need and in it turns
[3668.12 --> 3679.40]  to god that's faith and faith makes jesus your friend you see so many of us have this wrong image
[3679.40 --> 3687.72]  of god and god is not the task master pulling strings manipulating you against your will god isn't up
[3687.72 --> 3693.64]  in heaven waiting for you to figure it all out and get to him god isn't ignoring your cries or your tears
[3693.64 --> 3700.44]  god isn't some angry bearded man in the sky bubbling with rage just waiting to explode right god the father
[3700.44 --> 3713.08]  sent jesus the son to be your friend jesus wants your faith and to get it he gives you his life
[3713.08 --> 3723.16]  that's what god's love looks like that while we were yet sinners christ died for us this is love not
[3723.16 --> 3729.56]  that we have loved god but that he loved us and sent his son as an atoning sacrifice greater love has no
[3729.56 --> 3738.60]  one than this than to lay down one's life for one's friend jesus is the one friend who laid down his life
[3738.60 --> 3749.40]  for you all right i want you to to map this out and so we're going to draw a picture together
[3750.76 --> 3755.40]  if you don't have it right handy right now you're going to need a sheet of paper and a pen or a marker
[3755.40 --> 3761.48]  a crayon or something to write with and if you don't have that handy you go ahead and find it right now i am
[3761.48 --> 3766.92]  giving you permission as long as your parents agree and then parents you can also do this with us this
[3766.92 --> 3772.36]  morning i'll wait you go ahead and get your pens or papers or whatever you need we're going to draw a
[3772.36 --> 3780.60]  picture together so that by the end we can all see it in one snapshot together and like i said everyone
[3780.60 --> 3785.72]  can do this doesn't have to be the gems girls or the kids right we all need this reminder we can all
[3785.72 --> 3790.44]  draw this picture and then hang it up on our fridge or on our bulletin boards or wherever we have those
[3790.44 --> 3797.08]  things and in fact after church i would love it if with your parents help or your guardian's help
[3798.36 --> 3802.76]  you took a picture of what we drew and maybe you colored it maybe you spent some time
[3804.20 --> 3809.56]  and then you post that on social media be sure to tag our church in that so we can all see the work
[3809.56 --> 3817.24]  that you've done together all right was that enough time do we have paper okay so take your piece of paper
[3817.24 --> 3824.92]  and then on it i want you to trace the outline of your hand trace the outline of your hand with your
[3824.92 --> 3831.40]  fingers spread five fingers out so you can get it on the paper right in the middle of the paper trace
[3831.40 --> 3842.44]  the outline of your hand and now once you have that outline traced right in the middle of the palm of your
[3842.44 --> 3853.40]  your hand draw a circle right in the middle of the palm that's going to be jesus hand right pierced with
[3853.40 --> 3864.52]  a nail as he hung on a cross that's the hand of love that's the hand that reaches out to you to to lift
[3864.52 --> 3871.48]  you up to hug you and to hold you and to support you that's the hand of the gospel the hand that was pierced
[3871.48 --> 3873.00]  for our transgressions
[3875.80 --> 3884.68]  and now on that hand underneath the circle that you drew i want you to write an n and an e
[3885.48 --> 3888.12]  writing the word one so that circle now becomes an o
[3889.56 --> 3895.00]  all right so you have the hand and then it's down the middle there it says one jesus is the friend who
[3895.00 --> 3905.64]  laid down his life for you jesus is the one friend who will never leave jesus is the one who is always
[3905.64 --> 3912.36]  there jesus is the one who understands everything you are going through jesus is the one who knows your
[3912.36 --> 3923.00]  temptation and your trial jesus is the one who is right now interceding with the father on your behalf jesus is the one who is reaching out his hands to you
[3923.00 --> 3930.68]  jesus is the one transforming you he's the one changing your life that's what it means actually
[3930.68 --> 3936.84]  when jesus says i have called you friends for everything i have learned from my father i have
[3936.84 --> 3944.60]  made known to you jesus is making known to you the way of life he is making known to you a new identity
[3944.60 --> 3951.48]  and a new purpose a way of being human in the world that is for the glory of god and full of meaning
[3951.48 --> 3959.16]  and full of joy that lasts jesus is giving you a mission and it's the mission for which god sent
[3959.16 --> 3965.80]  jesus to the world and the mission for which god is now sending you as jesus disciple into the world
[3967.96 --> 3974.20]  you did not choose me but i chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit
[3974.92 --> 3984.20]  fruit that will last jesus is the one friend who will never ever fail you
[3988.52 --> 3996.68]  and as daughters of god as sons of god i hope and i pray and i i plead with you that that you will know
[3996.68 --> 4004.44]  this truth that jesus is the one that he chose you that he is the one and that his love for you
[4004.44 --> 4009.24]  changes you and it changes your life forever and in everything
[4013.72 --> 4021.64]  and listen listen to jesus words and in verse 11 he says i have told you this so that my joy may be in
[4021.64 --> 4028.52]  you and that your joy may be complete right my command is this to love each other as i have loved
[4028.52 --> 4036.84]  you and then again in verse 17 he says this is my command love each other and so jesus loves you and
[4036.84 --> 4043.40]  reaches out to you so that your joy may be complete and as your joy is made complete you begin to love
[4043.96 --> 4051.72]  each other and those around you loving jesus makes you able to love others being jesus friends makes you
[4051.72 --> 4061.40]  a better friend to each other remember our theme having jesus as your friend makes you a better friend to each
[4061.40 --> 4068.52]  other and so go back to your picture right on the hand that you have been drawing
[4068.52 --> 4076.04]  using the hole that became the o across the top of your palm now write the word each other
[4078.28 --> 4085.32]  right having jesus as your one friend your number one friend makes you a better friend to each other
[4085.32 --> 4093.16]  and here for just a minute i want to make a really important distinction and i want to be really
[4093.16 --> 4098.84]  clear that this is for everyone this isn't just for the gems girls this is for everyone because here
[4098.84 --> 4104.44]  we are talking about christian friendship or the the title of this message is jesus friends
[4104.44 --> 4111.32]  what does it mean to be the kind of friend that jesus has in mind because you see and i think all of
[4111.32 --> 4120.60]  us can relate to this you have some friends who are christian maybe you have a friend who is christian
[4120.60 --> 4127.96]  but i want to ask you do you have christian friendships now that's not just a semantic
[4127.96 --> 4132.36]  difference there's a grammatical difference right in the first one christian is a noun it's the person
[4132.36 --> 4138.28]  in the second christian is an adjective it's a describing word and when it comes to the kinds of
[4138.28 --> 4145.72]  friendships we need christian can't be just a noun right it has to describe the way we interact you
[4145.72 --> 4152.04]  see friends who are christians might not actually be or look any different than friends who aren't
[4153.40 --> 4162.52]  all right what's in a name but christian friendship is different christian friendship is is paul and luke
[4162.52 --> 4168.12]  and mark who traveled life together as missionaries who faced death together and endured prison together
[4168.12 --> 4173.72]  for their faith christian friendship is david and jonathan who trusted each other with everything in
[4173.72 --> 4179.72]  their whole of life christian friendship is jesus and and lazarus and weeping in death
[4181.16 --> 4187.64]  but a bunch of you listening to me right now have friends who are christians but do you have christian
[4187.64 --> 4193.08]  friendships friendships friendships that are defined by praying together about talking about life
[4193.08 --> 4198.04]  and faith together about sharing stories of god at work together about crying in our doubts together
[4198.04 --> 4202.52]  about mourning together and laughing together reading the bible together and worshiping together
[4203.24 --> 4210.04]  i want to challenge you today turn your friendships with christians into christian friendships
[4210.04 --> 4217.88]  make this community make this community your family stop being acquaintances and start being brothers and sisters together
[4221.08 --> 4227.72]  look i don't normally do things this way but uh i want to complete the picture that we've been drawing together
[4228.60 --> 4236.68]  so i'm going to end with five quick ways to define jesus friends right five ways that you can
[4236.68 --> 4245.08]  turn friends with christians into christian friendships and so first you're going to see it on the screen as we go through
[4245.96 --> 4255.08]  we've already named it but love but the first answer is love and so the hand that you are drawing right love on the thumb
[4256.12 --> 4265.56]  jesus said this is my command love each other now if you flip a couple pages over in your bible to john 13
[4265.56 --> 4274.84]  uh in verse 34 and 35 jesus says a new command i give you love one another as you i have loved
[4274.84 --> 4282.44]  you so must you love each other by this everyone will know that you are my disciples if you love
[4283.16 --> 4292.92]  each other hear this right this is important by this by loving each other everyone will know that you are my
[4292.92 --> 4299.88]  disciples if you love each other right not only does having jesus as a friend make you a better friend to each other
[4299.88 --> 4307.64]  but being the kind of friend that jesus wants you to be is proof that you are in turn friends with jesus
[4307.64 --> 4317.16]  being the kind of friend who lays down her life for a friend has the impact of showing the world and those around you who jesus is
[4317.16 --> 4334.20]  and so love as jesus loves now on your index finger right write the word serve here galatians 5 verse 13 says
[4334.20 --> 4343.64]  you my brothers and sisters were called to be free but do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh rather
[4343.64 --> 4351.96]  serve each other serve each other humbly in love serve each other right christian friendships serve
[4351.96 --> 4357.64]  each other remember the emerson quote from the beginning right the only way to have a friend is to be one
[4357.64 --> 4365.96]  that's what this is to serve each other and in serving you are again revealing jesus who did not come to
[4365.96 --> 4373.16]  be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many because jesus served you you are set free
[4373.16 --> 4386.04]  to serve each other on your next finger right pray for christian friendships pray for each other james 5
[4386.04 --> 4392.84]  says therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed the
[4392.84 --> 4399.88]  prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective pray with your friends pray for your friends
[4401.72 --> 4412.44]  ask your friends what can i pray for for you what can i pray for with you christian friends
[4414.04 --> 4422.68]  christian friendships pray for each other number four on your ring finger write the word accept
[4422.84 --> 4432.20]  right christian friendships accept each other for who we are in jesus paul writes in in romans 15 he
[4432.20 --> 4441.64]  says accept one another then just as christ accepted you in order to bring praise to god now christian
[4441.64 --> 4447.72]  friendships accept one another now that doesn't mean that we affirm every decision or we permit every
[4447.72 --> 4456.84]  every behavior but it does mean that our starting posture is acceptance it is welcoming it is openness
[4456.84 --> 4464.36]  it is humility and embrace when i truly believe that you will accept the real me that you will accept me
[4464.36 --> 4472.12]  for me with all my struggles with all my sins with all my doubts i will truly share those deep parts of my
[4472.12 --> 4481.88]  my life with you but only if i believe you will accept me in the midst of it christian friendships accept
[4482.68 --> 4489.64]  each other and then last but definitely not least on your pinky write the words be kind
[4490.92 --> 4497.64]  ephesians 4 tell us be kind and compassionate to each other forgiving each other just as in christ
[4497.64 --> 4506.20]  god forgave you i don't know about you but just imagine just imagine what it would be like if all
[4506.20 --> 4514.84]  your friends were kind and compassionate and forgiving and then flip it imagine if you're in your
[4514.84 --> 4522.28]  friendships you were the first to be kind imagine if in your friendships you tried to to outdo your
[4522.28 --> 4527.16]  friends in compassion imagine what it would look like if you were the first to forgive
[4529.80 --> 4536.60]  imagine the kinds of stories our neighbors or our society would tell if all christians everywhere
[4536.60 --> 4545.40]  were these kinds of friends that's the story that i want my life to be telling that i hope your life can
[4545.40 --> 4570.92]  tell gems girls and everyone else having jesus as your friend makes you a better friend to others with jesus you are never truly alone with jesus you have a friend who truly understands you and loves you and because of jesus you too
[4570.92 --> 4584.28]  can be the kind of friend that we all need i believe it and i pray that you can be it amen let's pray together
[4588.60 --> 4600.04]  lord jesus open our eyes to the amazing way that you are our friend open our eyes to the gospel truth of what
[4600.04 --> 4610.04]  you did because you love us open our eyes to see you more clearly to know your love more deeply and
[4610.04 --> 4617.56]  intimately and in that opening of our eyes may our lives be opened may our affections be stirred may our
[4617.56 --> 4623.24]  hearts be transformed that we can love our friends with that same love
[4623.24 --> 4637.88]  we can love send us out in the power of your name in the power of your spirit send us out in the truth of the gospel to be the kinds of friends that you would have us to be
[4639.96 --> 4643.24]  we might have christian friendships together
[4643.24 --> 4660.28]  jesus name we pray amen
[4661.96 --> 4665.08]  so
[4665.08 --> 4673.72]  What a friend we have in Jesus
[4673.72 --> 4679.32]  All our sins and griefs to bear
[4679.32 --> 4684.12]  What a privilege to marry
[4684.12 --> 4689.50]  Everything to God in prayer
[4689.50 --> 4694.32]  All our peace we often forfeit
[4694.32 --> 4699.56]  Oh, what a privilege pain we bear
[4699.56 --> 4704.28]  All because we do not carry
[4704.28 --> 4709.18]  Everything to God in prayer
[4709.18 --> 4717.24]  Have we trials and temptations?
[4718.24 --> 4720.86]  Is there trouble anywhere?
[4720.86 --> 4727.22]  We should never be discouraged
[4727.22 --> 4732.82]  Take it to the Lord in prayer
[4732.82 --> 4737.26]  Can we find a friend so faithful?
[4738.10 --> 4742.88]  Who will all our sorrows share?
[4742.88 --> 4747.52]  Jesus knows our every weakness
[4747.52 --> 4751.84]  Take it to the Lord in prayer
[4751.84 --> 4778.12]  Are we weak and happy laden?
[4778.12 --> 4782.48]  Come with the Lord of men
[4782.48 --> 4787.72]  Precious Savior still our refuge
[4787.72 --> 4792.44]  Take it to the Lord in prayer
[4792.44 --> 4797.56]  To thy friends who's wise forsaken
[4797.56 --> 4802.48]  Take it to the Lord in prayer
[4802.48 --> 4807.84]  Give His heart to take and shield me
[4807.84 --> 4811.94]  I will part the soul inside
[4811.94 --> 4830.40]  As we go this week
[4830.40 --> 4833.54]  We know that God goes with us
[4833.54 --> 4838.00]  That Jesus is our true and better friend
[4838.00 --> 4840.86]  And we go to be that kind of friend
[4840.86 --> 4843.00]  For those people in our lives
[4843.00 --> 4844.20]  Wherever we may meet them
[4844.20 --> 4845.38]  Wherever we interact
[4845.38 --> 4849.54]  And we go with the blessing of our God
[4849.54 --> 4851.96]  Receive the blessing of God
[4851.96 --> 4854.28]  For the day and week ahead
[4854.28 --> 4857.80]  May God go before you
[4857.80 --> 4858.64]  To lead you
[4858.64 --> 4860.84]  May God go behind you
[4860.84 --> 4861.70]  To guard you
[4861.70 --> 4863.16]  May God go beneath you
[4863.16 --> 4864.18]  To support you
[4864.18 --> 4866.64]  And may God go beside you
[4866.64 --> 4867.90]  To befriend you
[4867.90 --> 4870.96]  Do not be afraid
[4870.96 --> 4872.74]  Let the blessing of God
[4872.74 --> 4872.76]  Let the blessing of God
[4872.76 --> 4873.64]  Come upon you today
[4873.64 --> 4875.52]  Do not be afraid
[4875.52 --> 4878.76]  Go in peace
[4878.76 --> 4881.32]  To love and serve the Lord
[4881.32 --> 4883.84]  By being a Jesus friend
[4883.84 --> 4885.12]  Amen
[4900.96 --> 4910.70]  These are the days of evangelism
[4910.70 --> 4915.20]  Declaring the word of the Lord
[4915.20 --> 4919.52]  And these are the days of your servant
[4919.52 --> 4924.04]  Moses' righteousness being restored
[4924.04 --> 4928.76]  And though these are days of great trials
[4928.76 --> 4931.98]  The famine and darkness
[4931.98 --> 4934.20]  And song
[4934.20 --> 4937.92]  Till we are the voice in the desert
[4937.92 --> 4939.04]  Crying
[4939.04 --> 4942.14]  Prepare you the way of the Lord
[4942.14 --> 4944.52]  Be boldly come
[4944.52 --> 4947.02]  Riding on the clouds
[4947.02 --> 4949.34]  Shining like the sun
[4949.34 --> 4951.78]  At the trumpet calls
[4951.78 --> 4953.76]  Lift your voice
[4953.76 --> 4955.92]  Hear and dear believe
[4955.92 --> 4958.14]  God of Zion's hill
[4958.14 --> 4961.14]  Salvation and God
[4961.14 --> 4971.92]  And these are the days of Ezekiel
[4972.46 --> 4976.64]  The tribun's becoming as flesh
[4976.64 --> 4981.10]  And these are the days of your servant
[4981.10 --> 4983.26]  And gave every building
[4983.26 --> 4985.86]  A temple of grace
[4985.86 --> 4990.88]  And these are the days of the harvest
[4990.88 --> 4995.26]  The fields are as white in the world
[4995.26 --> 5000.32]  And we are the laborers in your opinion
[5000.32 --> 5003.76]  Declaring the word of the Lord
[5003.76 --> 5006.10]  Be boldly come
[5006.10 --> 5008.48]  Riding on the clouds
[5008.48 --> 5010.10]  Shining like the sun
[5010.10 --> 5013.16]  At the trumpet call
[5013.16 --> 5015.20]  Lift your voice
[5015.20 --> 5017.32]  Year of jubilee
[5017.32 --> 5019.58]  Lord of Zion's hill
[5019.58 --> 5022.26]  Salvation has come
[5022.26 --> 5032.64]  There's no God like Jehovah
[5032.64 --> 5036.86]  There's no God like Jehovah
[5036.86 --> 5041.36]  There's no God like Jehovah
[5041.36 --> 5055.36]  There's no God like Jehovah
[5055.36 --> 5062.36]  Behold it come, riding on the clouds, shining like the sun
[5062.36 --> 5069.36]  At the trumpet call, lift your voice, the year of jupilee
[5069.36 --> 5073.36]  When God of Zion tells salvation comes
[5073.36 --> 5080.36]  Behold it come, riding on the clouds, shining like the sun
[5080.36 --> 5087.36]  At the trumpet call, lift your voice, the year of jupilee
[5087.36 --> 5094.36]  When God of Zion tells salvation comes
[5094.36 --> 5097.36]  Man
[5097.36 --> 5104.36]  The way that you move me takes me far away
[5104.36 --> 5115.36]  Love me, traces I can sense you in everything
[5115.36 --> 5122.36]  The way that you move me takes me far away
[5122.36 --> 5125.36]  I seek no escape
[5125.36 --> 5130.36]  I'm dreaming through your eyes
[5130.36 --> 5136.36]  I am wandering through your mind
[5136.36 --> 5144.36]  I'm overtaken by the way that you deliver me
[5144.36 --> 5147.36]  I'm transcendent
[5147.36 --> 5150.36]  There's no place I'd rather be
[5150.36 --> 5152.36]  Here in the world
[5152.36 --> 5155.36]  Without you I'm incomplete
[5155.36 --> 5157.36]  It's hopeless
[5157.36 --> 5159.36]  You consume me
[5159.36 --> 5162.36]  You consume me
[5162.36 --> 5165.36]  Like a burning flame
[5165.36 --> 5168.36]  Running through my veins

[5170.36 --> 5173.36]  Moving through me
[5173.36 --> 5176.36]  Anytime, anyplace

[5187.36 --> 5189.36]  Holy, devoted
[5189.36 --> 5191.36]  I immerse myself in you
[5191.36 --> 5192.36]  You baptize me
[5192.36 --> 5194.36]  You baptize me
[5194.36 --> 5195.36]  In your love
[5195.36 --> 5196.36]  Cause drowning in the thought of you
[5196.36 --> 5197.36]  You're my soul
[5197.36 --> 5201.36]  I'm shaken by the things you do
[5201.36 --> 5202.36]  You do
[5202.36 --> 5204.36]  You know what I'm missing
[5204.36 --> 5206.36]  Doesn't matter what I lose

[5242.36 --> 5247.56]  Oh yes, you consume me
[5248.36 --> 5253.56]  You consume me
[5253.56 --> 5257.56]  I am in your hands
[5257.56 --> 5259.56]  Under your coat
[5259.56 --> 5263.56]  Like a carpet on a string
[5263.56 --> 5266.36]  I am willing to
[5266.36 --> 5268.36]  I am willing to
[5268.36 --> 5270.36]  And my feelings
[5270.36 --> 5272.36]  I'll be all alone
