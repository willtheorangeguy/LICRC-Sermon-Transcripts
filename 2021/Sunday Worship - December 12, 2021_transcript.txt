[1832.04 --> 1834.04]  I have a good Christmas question for you guys.
[1834.04 --> 1838.04]  Do you guys have any favorite Christmas carols?
[1838.04 --> 1842.04]  Any favorite songs that you sing at Christmas that you really love?
[1842.04 --> 1843.04]  jingle bells?
[1843.04 --> 1844.04]  I have a little bit of a new year years ago?
[1844.04 --> 1845.04]  I don't know.
[1845.04 --> 1846.04]  I don't know.
[1846.04 --> 1847.04]  I don't know.
[1847.04 --> 1848.04]  I don't know.
[1848.04 --> 1849.04]  I don't know.
[1849.04 --> 1850.04]  I don't know.
[1850.04 --> 1851.04]  I don't know.
[1851.04 --> 1852.04]  I don't know.
[1852.04 --> 1855.16]  Oh, ring, ring, ring the bells.
[1857.72 --> 1859.58]  Oh, wow, thanks for singing it.
[1860.90 --> 1862.64]  Oh, the concert you have, yeah.
[1863.76 --> 1865.08]  The First Noel.
[1870.38 --> 1870.94]  What's that?
[1871.90 --> 1873.34]  Oh, City Sidewalk.
[1873.50 --> 1874.88]  Yeah, these are all really good songs.
[1874.94 --> 1876.20]  There's lots on the radio right now.
[1876.22 --> 1877.04]  Oh, one last one.
[1878.60 --> 1880.16]  God rest ye merry gentlemen.
[1880.36 --> 1881.32]  These are awesome songs.
[1881.32 --> 1882.50]  We'll give Ruby the last one.
[1883.24 --> 1884.10]  Away in a manger.
[1884.16 --> 1885.26]  You guys are really good at this.
[1885.34 --> 1888.20]  I played a Scattergories song earlier this week,
[1888.24 --> 1889.40]  or game earlier this week,
[1889.44 --> 1890.98]  and I had to think of Christmas songs,
[1891.12 --> 1891.92]  and I got like two.
[1892.42 --> 1893.56]  I didn't do very good.
[1894.16 --> 1897.72]  So, oh, I can't remember anymore.
[1897.86 --> 1899.52]  I could barely recall them then.
[1899.90 --> 1901.50]  Well, we have something special we're going to do
[1901.50 --> 1903.90]  in children's worship time today,
[1904.06 --> 1905.80]  and my tie is a little bit of hint,
[1905.88 --> 1907.04]  and so is the questions.
[1907.68 --> 1909.28]  We have got Mr. Baker.
[1909.28 --> 1911.94]  That's Allie and Spencer's dad.
[1912.00 --> 1912.78]  He's going to join us,
[1912.84 --> 1915.38]  and we're going to do a whole bunch of gifts.
[1916.06 --> 1916.92]  Oh, and Lily, yes.
[1917.38 --> 1920.86]  We are going to sing Christmas carols
[1920.86 --> 1922.72]  with Mr. Baker today in worship time.
[1923.08 --> 1924.48]  So we will have, of course,
[1924.52 --> 1925.74]  our story like we always do,
[1925.80 --> 1927.96]  but then we'll get to do a special bit
[1927.96 --> 1928.82]  of worship time together.
[1928.96 --> 1931.88]  So let's stand and do the children's blessing,
[1931.88 --> 1934.46]  and then we can go and get some singing going.
[1938.54 --> 1939.78]  All right.
[1939.92 --> 1939.98]  Ready, guys?
[1940.34 --> 1941.02]  Hands up.
[1941.02 --> 1942.98]  All right.
[1943.26 --> 1948.84]  All right.
[1948.84 --> 1949.10]  Bye.
[1949.10 --> 1949.94]  Bye.
[1949.96 --> 1950.66]  Bye.
[1950.66 --> 1950.90]  Bye.
[1951.60 --> 1952.54]  Bye.
[1953.86 --> 1954.38]  Bye.
[1954.38 --> 1954.84]  Bye.
[1955.72 --> 1960.26]  Bye.
[1960.42 --> 1961.40]  Bye.
[1961.72 --> 1961.78]  Bye.
[1961.88 --> 1984.18]  I think the big problem is the mic stand because I've got to be able to read my phone.
[1984.18 --> 1988.02]  My eyes aren't too good.
[1988.02 --> 1992.52]  First of all, my name is Peter and I'm one of the elders here at the church.
[1992.52 --> 2000.50]  And I wanted to start off today just by saying that the budget that we proposed and voted
[2000.50 --> 2004.46]  on at the congregational meeting this past week was passed unanimously.
[2004.46 --> 2007.80]  So thank you all for that.
[2007.80 --> 2016.94]  Let's go to our God in our church.
[2016.94 --> 2019.56]  Holy Triune God.
[2019.56 --> 2024.90]  The Advent Christmas season always adds a new component to our worship.
[2024.90 --> 2030.94]  We celebrate for weeks in anticipation of the day that we get to celebrate the arrival of
[2030.94 --> 2031.94]  the Savior.
[2031.94 --> 2061.94] 
[2061.94 --> 2065.56]  That Mary would not have wanted to be thinking about.
[2065.56 --> 2067.72]  But it's something that we are very aware of now.
[2070.28 --> 2078.18]  Lord, what an amazing sight it would have been to see Jesus heal and cast out spirits and be real with those that wanted to follow him.
[2078.18 --> 2086.14]  He physically isn't here to put his hands on us now or speak to our sicknesses to cast them aside.
[2086.14 --> 2089.14]  But he did show us how to come to you.
[2089.14 --> 2094.80]  Through our prayers, we know we can appeal for your healing.
[2094.80 --> 2102.76]  We continue to be thankful along with Bob and his family for the news that he is cancer free.
[2102.76 --> 2109.42]  We are also thankful along with the LCS community as a missing teen was found safe this week.
[2109.42 --> 2119.10]  Lord, we think of the many college and university students that are gearing up for exams and looking forward to Christmas break.
[2120.10 --> 2125.04]  Help them to feel confident in their preparation so they can truly have a good day.
[2125.04 --> 2136.74]  We realize too, Father, that while we continually focus on the excitement and celebration of this season of the year,
[2137.60 --> 2145.74]  there are those that suffer, mourn, and those that don't have the ability to be joyful in the wake of many different circumstances.
[2145.74 --> 2152.04]  Even now, Lord, so many are still dealing with the aftermath of fire last summer,
[2152.66 --> 2155.32]  and now many are having to get through massive floods,
[2155.66 --> 2159.66]  not to mention the seeming threat of yet another wave of the pandemic.
[2161.00 --> 2164.54]  It really feels like there is a dark cloud of doom and gloom over us, Lord.
[2165.18 --> 2167.68]  It just won't go away or even give us a break.
[2169.28 --> 2170.84]  Help us to see the light, Lord.
[2170.84 --> 2177.66]  Help us not only to look back on the work of Jesus and his coming to earth to be our Savior,
[2177.76 --> 2179.60]  but also to look forward to his coming again.
[2182.02 --> 2184.30]  In Advent, we sing,
[2184.66 --> 2186.00]  Come Thou Long-Expected Jesus,
[2186.90 --> 2189.48]  as a reflection, waiting for his birth.
[2191.04 --> 2192.82]  We should sing this song now,
[2193.34 --> 2196.06]  as his long-expected second arrival is ending.
[2198.40 --> 2200.14]  Come Thou Long-Expected Jesus,
[2200.14 --> 2202.94]  who has conquered death and risen on high.
[2203.64 --> 2205.08]  Part the clouds with your revival,
[2205.46 --> 2206.36]  your arrival,
[2207.26 --> 2209.06]  and let us then be with you tonight.
[2212.02 --> 2213.52]  Be with Pastor Kevin today, Lord,
[2213.56 --> 2214.84]  as he delivers your word to us
[2214.84 --> 2219.56]  in this series of reflecting on truly what was happening during the Christmas story.
[2220.54 --> 2221.84]  We thank you for your word.
[2222.60 --> 2224.84]  Give us ears that not only hear,
[2225.40 --> 2225.98]  but listen,
[2227.18 --> 2227.72]  and hearts
[2227.72 --> 2230.72]  help us to take action
[2230.72 --> 2232.62]  what we are fed here today.
[2233.88 --> 2234.24]  Amen.
[2234.24 --> 2234.30]  Amen.
[2234.30 --> 2234.36]  Amen.
[2234.36 --> 2234.38]  Amen.
[2234.38 --> 2234.40]  Amen.
[2234.40 --> 2234.44]  Amen.
[2234.44 --> 2240.06]  Amen.
[2240.06 --> 2241.16]  Thank you.
[2241.64 --> 2241.84]  Amen.
[2242.84 --> 2243.12]  Amen.
[2243.28 --> 2243.60]  Amen.
[2243.64 --> 2243.78]  Amen.
[2244.50 --> 2244.70]  Amen.
[2244.76 --> 2245.40]  Amen.
[2245.44 --> 2245.62]  Amen.
[2245.62 --> 2245.90]  Amen.
[2245.90 --> 2246.36]  Amen.
[2246.36 --> 2247.08]  Amen.
[2247.08 --> 2247.62]  Amen.
[2247.62 --> 2248.04]  Amen.
[2248.04 --> 2248.58]  Amen.
[2248.60 --> 2248.72]  Amen.
[2248.72 --> 2249.04]  Amen.
[2251.20 --> 2251.72]  Amen.
[2251.72 --> 2251.88]  Amen.
[2251.88 --> 2252.60]  Amen.
[2260.74 --> 2261.68]  Amen.
[2261.68 --> 2261.98]  Amen.
[2261.98 --> 2262.50]  Amen.
[2262.50 --> 2263.04]  Amen.
[2263.04 --> 2264.08]  Amen.
[2264.08 --> 2268.04]  Good morning, everyone.
[2268.26 --> 2268.64]  There we go.
[2270.16 --> 2275.54]  Getting your fortune told is once again becoming quite popular in our culture.
[2276.24 --> 2281.96]  Getting a psychic reading or your tarot cards presented to you or having your palms read
[2281.96 --> 2286.82]  or if you're feeling independent, you can go and read your horoscope online still because
[2286.82 --> 2288.58]  no one's really getting newspapers anymore.
[2289.28 --> 2293.36]  These are all things that are still very popular in our culture.
[2293.36 --> 2298.16]  My personal favorite, though, of course, is the fortune cookie because not only do you
[2298.16 --> 2301.56]  get a little strip of paper that tells you how your life is going to go, but you also
[2301.56 --> 2305.50]  get this beautiful wafer that's drier than Bill Murray in Groundhog Day.
[2306.32 --> 2309.74]  Now, some of the fortunes in these cookies are just amazing.
[2310.16 --> 2312.88]  I did a little Google search this week and found a few of my favorites.
[2313.30 --> 2317.30]  Apparently, these are all true, but imagine getting any of these in your next cookie.
[2317.40 --> 2318.04]  You crack it open.
[2318.04 --> 2322.00]  It says, blessed are the children, for they shall inherit national debt.
[2322.64 --> 2328.12]  Or you crack open your cookie and it says, you are about to become $10.95 poorer.
[2328.66 --> 2330.44]  Or $8.95 if you had the buffet.
[2331.34 --> 2334.84]  Or you open and it says, to truly find yourself.
[2335.52 --> 2336.98]  Play, hide, and seek by yourself.
[2337.74 --> 2339.40]  And this one actually was my personal favorite.
[2339.50 --> 2342.44]  You open your cookie and you read, you shouldn't have had the pork.
[2342.44 --> 2347.32]  There was actually, there was an episode of The Simpsons where Homer gets hired to be the
[2347.32 --> 2351.06]  main writer for the fortune cookie company and he had a whole bunch of good ones in there.
[2351.12 --> 2355.54]  My personal favorite in that episode was, the price of stamps will continue to climb higher.
[2356.56 --> 2357.14]  They're so good.
[2357.88 --> 2359.66]  People love fortunes.
[2360.12 --> 2361.80]  And of course, cookies can't be trusted.
[2361.90 --> 2362.90]  I've been saying that for years.
[2363.26 --> 2368.34]  And horoscopes and palm readers, they're really just giving blanket sweep statements that could
[2368.34 --> 2370.56]  apply to anyone on any given moment.
[2370.56 --> 2372.94]  But fortune tellers are out there.
[2373.76 --> 2375.86]  And they have been for a long time.
[2377.30 --> 2381.14]  Today's sermon, we're going to look at some ancient fortune tellers.
[2381.28 --> 2384.78]  Perhaps wizards or astrologers are a better name.
[2384.86 --> 2386.90]  You know them as the magi.
[2387.40 --> 2389.44]  Or more commonly, the wise men.
[2390.10 --> 2391.76]  So we're going to read their story today.
[2391.90 --> 2396.36]  So turn with me in your Bibles to Matthew 2, verses 1 to 12.
[2396.40 --> 2397.46]  And we'll read this story together.
[2397.46 --> 2402.02]  It'll be on the screen behind me, but as always, I encourage you, please have your Bibles open
[2402.02 --> 2404.16]  or your Bible apps out.
[2404.44 --> 2405.00]  Both are good.
[2405.14 --> 2407.10]  And follow along with me today.
[2407.20 --> 2410.46]  So Matthew 2, the first 12 verses, reads like this.
[2411.86 --> 2416.30]  Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea during the reign of King Herod.
[2416.30 --> 2422.18]  About that same time, some wise men from eastern lands arrived in Jerusalem, asking,
[2422.82 --> 2425.20]  Where is the newborn king of the Jews?
[2425.80 --> 2429.10]  We saw his star as it rose, and we have come to worship him.
[2430.18 --> 2433.10]  King Herod was deeply disturbed when he heard this.
[2433.36 --> 2437.34]  As was everyone in Jerusalem, he called a meeting of the leading priests and teachers
[2437.34 --> 2441.90]  of the religious law and asked, Where is the Messiah supposed to be born?
[2441.90 --> 2446.26]  In Bethlehem in Judea, they said, For this is what the prophet wrote.
[2446.58 --> 2451.42]  And you, O Bethlehem in the land of Judah, are not the least among the ruling cities of
[2451.42 --> 2455.00]  Judah, for a ruler will come for you who will be the shepherd for my people.
[2456.16 --> 2460.94]  Then Herod called for a private meeting with the wise men, and he learned from them the
[2460.94 --> 2462.90]  time when the star first appeared.
[2462.90 --> 2469.74]  And he told them, Go to Bethlehem and search carefully for the child, and when you find
[2469.74 --> 2473.44]  him, come back and tell me, so I can go and worship him too.
[2474.96 --> 2478.98]  After this interview, the wise men went their way, and the star they had seen in the east
[2478.98 --> 2480.30]  guided them to Bethlehem.
[2481.06 --> 2484.38]  He went ahead of them and stopped over the place where the child was.
[2484.76 --> 2487.28]  When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
[2487.28 --> 2494.22]  They entered the house and saw the child with his mother, Mary, and they bowed down and
[2494.22 --> 2494.96]  worshiped him.
[2495.78 --> 2500.60]  Then they opened their treasure chests and gave him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
[2501.58 --> 2506.56]  When it was time to leave, they returned to their own country by a different route, for
[2506.56 --> 2509.64]  God had warned them in a dream not to return to Herod.
[2510.62 --> 2511.76]  The word of the Lord.
[2511.76 --> 2516.74]  Now, this story does continue, of course.
[2516.86 --> 2522.16]  If you were to continue to read the rest of Matthew 2, King Herod, he was not a fan that
[2522.16 --> 2524.92]  the wise men didn't go back and see him, and he got mad.
[2525.38 --> 2531.30]  He was scared he was going to be losing his power to this baby king, and so he commands
[2531.30 --> 2536.36]  that all of the baby boys, age two and under, in Bethlehem and the surrounding area must be
[2536.36 --> 2536.70]  killed.
[2537.54 --> 2538.76]  And so they are.
[2538.76 --> 2543.00]  Herod kills, presumably, hundreds of baby boys.
[2544.10 --> 2548.68]  Mary and Joseph and Jesus, though, they were warned in a dream by an angel, and they flee
[2548.68 --> 2552.30]  to Egypt, where they hide out safely for the first couple years of Jesus' life.
[2552.88 --> 2554.46]  That's the story of Matthew 2.
[2554.54 --> 2555.64]  That's a crazy story.
[2556.44 --> 2558.24]  That's a terrible story.
[2559.50 --> 2561.36]  A very important story.
[2563.04 --> 2565.28]  We've made the story a little bit prettier, though, haven't we?
[2565.32 --> 2566.46]  We've made it more palatable.
[2566.46 --> 2570.86]  It's more unique and quaint and cute in the kids' Bible stories, that's for sure.
[2571.18 --> 2575.82]  And in our decorations at home, we kind of zhuzh the wise men up a little bit, too, right?
[2575.92 --> 2577.50]  Three kings come for a baby.
[2577.60 --> 2578.42]  They hang out in a barn.
[2578.50 --> 2578.98]  It's very cute.
[2580.44 --> 2584.66]  Like we've been saying these past two weeks, we've really hallmarked Christmas up.
[2585.70 --> 2588.26]  And so through the series, we're trying to un-hallmark it.
[2588.50 --> 2592.16]  We're trying to do our best to tell the story that actually happened.
[2592.16 --> 2598.70]  And the story of the Magi is so much more than just a few wise guys coming to meet a baby.
[2600.08 --> 2605.26]  What's fascinating about this Christmas story is what Matthew includes in the text.
[2605.86 --> 2612.02]  Now, considering that this is the birth of Christ, there's not a lot there in the Bible.
[2613.14 --> 2617.58]  Matthew starts off in Matthew 1 with the genealogy, which we talked about a couple weeks ago.
[2617.58 --> 2624.86]  And then he spends five verses, just five, telling about Mary's encounter with the angel and how Joseph reacted to that.
[2624.94 --> 2629.86]  And then Joseph having a dream from another angel, saying that Mary is in fact pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
[2630.54 --> 2633.52]  And then the birth of Jesus in Matthew is two verses.
[2634.62 --> 2635.80]  It's actually really just one verse.
[2635.92 --> 2637.66]  Matthew 1, 24 to 25.
[2637.80 --> 2638.42]  It'll be behind me.
[2638.50 --> 2639.70]  They read like this.
[2639.70 --> 2654.52]  That's it.
[2655.52 --> 2658.16]  That's all Matthew tells us about the birth of Christ.
[2658.26 --> 2658.92]  Two sentences.
[2660.10 --> 2663.44]  And actually, that's two sentences more than Mark writes in his gospel.
[2664.50 --> 2666.88]  Mark doesn't even include the Christmas story in his telling.
[2666.88 --> 2671.08]  And John's gospel, he tells this beautiful Christmas story.
[2671.20 --> 2677.88]  It's a passage about the word existing in the beginning and coming down and taking on flesh and dwelling among us.
[2678.08 --> 2680.32]  And it's this wonderful poetic text.
[2680.46 --> 2682.84]  It's filled with imagery and rich in theology.
[2683.20 --> 2685.46]  But it's also only 17 verses long.
[2685.72 --> 2689.22]  And it gives zero details to what actually happened that night.
[2690.56 --> 2691.78]  It's not a narrative.
[2691.98 --> 2692.56]  It's imagery.
[2692.56 --> 2697.24]  So Luke, then, is the only gospel that goes a little bit deeper into the story.
[2697.44 --> 2700.26]  But even his telling is a little bit more sparse than maybe we would like.
[2700.52 --> 2703.98]  We read about the angels and the shepherds, what we heard last week from Pastor Chris.
[2704.16 --> 2705.22]  That passage is in there.
[2705.44 --> 2708.72]  But beyond that, do you know how many verses there are about Jesus' death in Luke?
[2709.84 --> 2710.20]  Seven.
[2711.84 --> 2712.36]  That's it.
[2712.92 --> 2716.00]  And if you read Luke 2, 1 to 7 later today, I challenge you to do that,
[2716.00 --> 2721.44]  you'll see that out of those seven verses, five of them are all about a census that is being taken
[2721.44 --> 2724.06]  and the Roman politics of the day and where they needed to go.
[2724.20 --> 2729.04]  Which leaves, again, two verses about Jesus' birth.
[2733.38 --> 2736.06]  Now, Matthew's gospel is no different.
[2736.22 --> 2738.10]  But Matthew, he's a good writer.
[2738.26 --> 2740.72]  So are all of these apostles, are all these disciples who wrote.
[2740.72 --> 2749.00]  And so him limiting words to tell the story means that the words he uses must matter a lot.
[2750.44 --> 2756.48]  Jesus' birth, the trip to Bethlehem, the shepherd's part, which Pastor Chris talked about last week,
[2756.52 --> 2759.56]  the whole manger thing, which Pastor Chris will talk about next week,
[2759.90 --> 2762.18]  all of that is not included in Matthew's gospel.
[2762.58 --> 2768.52]  But as we read today, he takes an entire chapter to talk about these magi
[2768.52 --> 2771.12]  and their interaction with Herod.
[2773.04 --> 2776.66]  In fact, it's kind of the main cog of Matthew's telling of this story.
[2777.50 --> 2778.04]  But why?
[2779.80 --> 2783.46]  Well, to understand this, let's look at who these wise men are.
[2785.78 --> 2786.76]  I love cell phones.
[2786.84 --> 2787.34]  Aren't they fun?
[2787.46 --> 2787.86]  It's okay.
[2787.96 --> 2788.68]  We don't need to look.
[2788.84 --> 2789.32]  It's fine.
[2790.16 --> 2791.70]  We're going to look at who these wise men are.
[2791.70 --> 2797.50]  First of all, notice that there's actually no mention of there being three of them.
[2798.52 --> 2799.48]  There's no mention of there being three.
[2799.52 --> 2803.00]  They bought three gifts, and so we then assume there's three of them.
[2803.02 --> 2804.84]  But we have no idea how many there actually were.
[2805.20 --> 2806.00]  There could have been two.
[2806.48 --> 2807.24]  There could have been 20.
[2807.88 --> 2813.20]  All we know is that there was a number small enough that they could have had a private interaction with Herod.
[2813.24 --> 2814.60]  So there probably wasn't 200.
[2814.98 --> 2816.22]  But the exact number, we don't know.
[2816.22 --> 2822.38]  We also know that they're from the eastern lands, but that's all our text actually says.
[2823.10 --> 2831.32]  The Bible doesn't say where they are actually from, but through some history and some other literature, it is likely that they were from Arabia.
[2831.90 --> 2834.12]  And if you're having a hard time placing Arabia, think Aladdin.
[2834.12 --> 2843.92]  Back then, a lot of gold was mined in Arabia, and both frankincense and myrrh were harvested from trees that only grew in southern Arabia.
[2844.04 --> 2846.22]  So that's the first big clue from where they came from.
[2846.42 --> 2847.24]  But there's more evidence.
[2847.68 --> 2852.50]  The historian Justin writes that wise men from Arabia came to Bethlehem and worshipped the child.
[2852.86 --> 2858.96]  And both Tertullian and Clement of Rome, both historians of the late first and second centuries, for you history buffs,
[2858.96 --> 2861.86]  they affirm that that information is true as well.
[2862.06 --> 2863.62]  Now maybe you think, well, who cares?
[2863.74 --> 2864.46]  They're from Arabia.
[2865.34 --> 2866.32]  Why is that important?
[2867.36 --> 2871.14]  But it does mean without a doubt that these men were not Jewish.
[2872.08 --> 2873.00]  They were Gentiles.
[2873.08 --> 2875.68]  They were unexpected outsiders.
[2877.74 --> 2879.32]  Now secondly, they're called magi.
[2880.60 --> 2884.56]  Now magi, from biblical standards, were not waddle.
[2884.56 --> 2892.08]  They were astrologers, men who followed stars to seek wisdom, men who were idolaters.
[2892.84 --> 2897.64]  They worshipped the stars, in fact, and they sought their guidance from them.
[2898.72 --> 2905.22]  In fact, the only two other times in the Gospels that magi are mentioned, they are seriously rebuked.
[2905.84 --> 2911.18]  In Acts 8, 9 to 24, we read about Simon the magician, the magi, who tried to pay the apostles
[2911.18 --> 2914.92]  to learn how they were doing their miracles so that he could gain a few bucks.
[2915.58 --> 2917.06]  And he was rebuked hard by Peter.
[2917.70 --> 2924.00]  In Acts 13, 6 to 11, we hear of another magician named Bar Jesus, or he's called Elemis later on.
[2924.10 --> 2928.42]  He opposed the work of the apostle Paul, and he tried to stand in his way.
[2928.84 --> 2932.72]  Again, Paul admonishes him, and the magician actually becomes blind.
[2933.10 --> 2936.60]  In both stories, these magi are pagan magicians.
[2936.60 --> 2939.10]  They use sorcery and trickery to earn wealth.
[2939.70 --> 2943.40]  That's who these magi in our story are, too.
[2944.54 --> 2948.68]  They're non-Jewish, pagan idol worshippers coming from a distant land,
[2949.00 --> 2953.96]  using their idols, the stars, to guide them to Christ.
[2956.80 --> 2962.14]  And yet, we know that God is the God of heaven, with its stars,
[2962.14 --> 2966.48]  and the God of this earth, with its humanity and its genealogies.
[2966.54 --> 2972.04]  And we know that Matthew points out that God can move both for his will.
[2974.28 --> 2976.98]  The magi were also very rich and wealthy.
[2977.16 --> 2981.86]  They would have been very big cultural influencers, flaunting their wealth for sure,
[2981.92 --> 2982.90]  but they seemed wise.
[2983.02 --> 2986.00]  They knew things, perhaps, that they had no business of knowing.
[2986.00 --> 2992.90]  They were obsessed with these magi, and the magi had tremendous influence of that culture.
[2993.26 --> 2996.00]  Think of Instagram influencers right now.
[2996.10 --> 2997.34]  They set the trends.
[2997.48 --> 2999.38]  They moved the cultural needle.
[2999.86 --> 3001.76]  They were highly influential.
[3003.08 --> 3005.92]  To read wise men, that's who we are talking about.
[3006.88 --> 3010.84]  Wealthy, influential, pagan idol worshippers,
[3010.84 --> 3013.98]  studying the stars and taking meaning from them.
[3016.00 --> 3021.96]  Now, when Matthew writes this gospel, his audience is predominantly Jewish.
[3022.14 --> 3025.10]  That's who Matthew is targeting when he's writing this gospel.
[3025.50 --> 3029.82]  So the fact that he spends a good chunk, in fact, the majority of this birth story,
[3030.38 --> 3032.68]  on pagan astrologers from Arabia,
[3033.38 --> 3035.96]  it would have stood out to his readers in a big way.
[3037.18 --> 3041.92]  More than that, the Jewish representative in this story, which we read today,
[3042.02 --> 3044.80]  is none other than King Herod.
[3046.00 --> 3049.36]  Now, remember, King Herod, he's a Jewish king.
[3050.02 --> 3052.30]  He's ruling over the territory of Judah,
[3052.30 --> 3055.80]  and he's under the influence of the Roman emperor, but he is Jewish.
[3057.10 --> 3058.24]  He's also a bully.
[3058.72 --> 3060.48]  He's obsessed with his power.
[3061.02 --> 3065.38]  He's scraped his way to the top, kicking anyone below him to get there,
[3065.40 --> 3069.38]  and he's brown-nosing the people above him to gain all the power that he can.
[3069.38 --> 3074.84]  Power was everything to him.
[3075.68 --> 3079.90]  And we can see that by his response to the news that a baby king was born in his territory.
[3080.16 --> 3085.74]  He was so worried about his power diminishing that he kicked hard beneath him once again,
[3086.74 --> 3090.98]  and he ends up murdering babies to keep his control.
[3091.38 --> 3093.86]  There is no hallmark about this story.
[3093.86 --> 3096.42]  There is no hallmark movie out there about this.
[3096.66 --> 3097.40]  It's not pretty.
[3099.76 --> 3102.96]  And so on the one side of this story, you've got these pagan astrologers,
[3103.28 --> 3106.58]  and on the other side, you've got this rotten Jewish king.
[3107.88 --> 3112.96]  And this is where, as Jewish readers of this story, Matthew's audience would have cringed.
[3114.16 --> 3115.78]  Perhaps they would have stopped listening altogether.
[3115.78 --> 3120.54]  So, we're going to look now at another well-known Bible story for a moment,
[3121.14 --> 3122.50]  to help tie this together a little bit.
[3122.54 --> 3125.84]  We're going to bring it all the way back to Exodus, with Moses and the Israelites.
[3126.92 --> 3131.76]  Now remember, the Israelites, the Jews, they were being held in Egypt as slaves,
[3132.28 --> 3134.88]  and Moses was sent by God to save them from Pharaoh.
[3134.98 --> 3138.68]  Now we read in Exodus 8, verse 1, that God calls them out of Egypt, but why?
[3138.82 --> 3139.84]  Let's read along with me here.
[3141.36 --> 3142.16]  Exodus 8, verse 1,
[3142.16 --> 3156.22]  It was about worship.
[3157.22 --> 3162.00]  The Israelites needed to be freed from their oppressors because they were supposed to be worshiping God.
[3162.12 --> 3166.56]  God's people, the Jewish people, needed to be freed from their oppressive world
[3166.56 --> 3169.40]  so that they could worship Yahweh.
[3169.40 --> 3174.74]  But the king of Egypt, Pharaoh back then, he was scared he would lose his power.
[3175.74 --> 3178.14]  His power in the form of slaves, free labor.
[3178.92 --> 3180.04]  And so he wouldn't let them leave.
[3181.38 --> 3183.88]  Now fast forward to our story again today, and things have switched.
[3185.20 --> 3188.16]  It is now the world coming to Jesus.
[3189.02 --> 3189.36]  What?
[3190.52 --> 3191.64]  To worship him.
[3192.40 --> 3194.60]  This pagan world in the form of these wise men,
[3194.86 --> 3198.22]  they are coming to worship the king of the Jews.
[3198.22 --> 3199.88]  Verse 2 of our text,
[3199.96 --> 3202.08]  Where is this newborn king of the Jews, they say?
[3202.64 --> 3206.50]  We saw his star as it rose, and we have come to worship him.
[3208.50 --> 3211.20]  These pagan astrologers knew who Jesus was,
[3211.80 --> 3213.52]  and they came not to see him simply,
[3213.74 --> 3215.62]  not to influence him in any way,
[3216.24 --> 3217.56]  but to worship him.
[3217.56 --> 3223.46]  But this time, it's not Pharaoh who's worried about losing his power.
[3224.00 --> 3225.62]  It's the Jewish king.
[3226.86 --> 3230.12]  He's the one who devises a plan to figure out where Jesus was born,
[3230.30 --> 3231.88]  and we know what his intentions are.
[3231.90 --> 3232.84]  He's not going to worship him.
[3232.88 --> 3233.92]  He wants Jesus killed.
[3235.38 --> 3238.80]  And when the Magi don't return to tell Herod where Jesus is,
[3238.96 --> 3241.36]  he kills all of the boys in Bethlehem
[3241.36 --> 3244.88]  and the surrounding region who are two years old and younger.
[3246.02 --> 3249.56]  Remember who else killed babies when their power was threatened?
[3249.68 --> 3250.60]  The dots are connecting.
[3251.72 --> 3252.06]  Pharaoh.
[3252.72 --> 3255.10]  Pharaoh, back in that story, back in Exodus again,
[3255.10 --> 3258.14]  saw how big the Israelite population was getting,
[3258.46 --> 3261.92]  and so he commanded that all of the boys born of the Israelite people
[3261.92 --> 3264.32]  be drowned in the Nile River.
[3265.28 --> 3266.38]  And of course, Moses was saved.
[3266.46 --> 3267.94]  He was put in a basket, floated down the river.
[3267.94 --> 3270.56]  We might know the story, and that continues from there.
[3270.76 --> 3273.18]  But that's why this story is so important to Matthew.
[3274.22 --> 3279.56]  He is overlaying the birth of Christ with the Exodus in Egypt,
[3279.68 --> 3282.86]  except this time, it's not his people worshiping God.
[3284.24 --> 3285.88]  It's the world who is.
[3287.30 --> 3290.78]  And it's not the Egyptian king that's opposing God.
[3291.72 --> 3293.02]  It's the Jewish one.
[3295.30 --> 3297.22]  The world came to Jesus.
[3297.38 --> 3297.78]  Verse 11,
[3297.78 --> 3318.86]  There was no halo present on Jesus' head like some of the pictures you might see.
[3319.06 --> 3319.90]  He wasn't glowing.
[3320.72 --> 3322.70]  He didn't perform miracles in his crib.
[3322.82 --> 3324.58]  He didn't speak to them yet.
[3324.58 --> 3329.38]  But with no evidence other than a star leading their way,
[3330.50 --> 3333.04]  these magi, the world, in reverence,
[3334.12 --> 3336.80]  sought the king and worshipped him.
[3337.32 --> 3339.44]  It's the power of Christ.
[3339.44 --> 3348.08]  And so the magi are Moses and the Israelites desiring to worship God.
[3348.68 --> 3354.36]  And Herod is Pharaoh, losing his power and murdering children in order to retain it.
[3355.52 --> 3358.34]  Matthew flips the script, and the world becomes God's people,
[3358.42 --> 3360.18]  and God's people become God's oppressors.
[3360.18 --> 3363.74]  And there's one more comparison from the two stories that stand.
[3363.80 --> 3370.00]  In Exodus, God's people were called to flee Egypt in order to escape a worldly tyrant.
[3370.40 --> 3378.06]  And in Matthew 2, God's son flees to Egypt in order to escape a Jewish one.
[3378.06 --> 3381.50]  Again, this is not hallmark material.
[3382.04 --> 3384.82]  This is a very, very messy story.
[3384.94 --> 3389.50]  It's not a cute tale of some wise sages coming from afar to gawk at a baby.
[3389.64 --> 3394.36]  It's a story filled with friction between God's people and the world.
[3394.44 --> 3397.08]  A story of lost power being fought over.
[3397.16 --> 3402.12]  A story that reshapes God's grand redemption narrative.
[3402.12 --> 3409.58]  Last week, Pastor Chris pointed out that Luke's story of Jesus is bookended.
[3409.72 --> 3412.72]  His whole gospel is bookended by shepherds and women,
[3413.12 --> 3417.52]  two groups of people whose words at the time were untrustworthy.
[3418.90 --> 3420.48]  Matthew bookends his story too.
[3421.50 --> 3424.78]  He starts with the Gentile outsiders, the magi.
[3425.40 --> 3428.90]  And at the end of his book, Jesus, in the Great Commission, calls us,
[3429.56 --> 3431.90]  all who believe to go out to all nations.
[3433.06 --> 3435.44]  In the beginning, the world comes to worship Jesus.
[3435.66 --> 3439.08]  And in the end, Jesus tells his followers to go to the world.
[3440.86 --> 3447.62]  This passage sets the stage and redefines the boundaries of who Jesus came to save
[3447.62 --> 3451.08]  and who can come to worship him.
[3452.88 --> 3453.44]  Everyone.
[3456.34 --> 3461.76]  Jesus came for his people like the untrustworthy and unruly Jewish shepherds.
[3462.12 --> 3463.06]  Jesus came for all people.
[3463.06 --> 3465.02]  Who also came to worship him and proclaim his name.
[3465.06 --> 3469.98]  But not all of his people would accept him, as we see with King Herod and later on with the Pharisees.
[3470.44 --> 3473.78]  However, Jesus also came for the unexpected outsider.
[3473.78 --> 3476.16]  The wise men were pagans.
[3476.16 --> 3477.16]  The worldly people.
[3477.16 --> 3477.92]  The worldly people.
[3477.92 --> 3482.20]  But they came and were welcome to worship the Savior.
[3483.06 --> 3485.16]  Jesus came for all people.
[3485.28 --> 3489.36]  He came to this earth, born of a family so broken and messy,
[3489.42 --> 3491.52]  it makes the Kardashians look like the Brady Bunch.
[3491.96 --> 3495.82]  He came for the shepherds and the wise men.
[3495.82 --> 3496.76]  He came for you.
[3496.76 --> 3498.60]  And he came for me.
[3498.60 --> 3500.86]  And he came for all people.
[3502.52 --> 3507.10]  He came and he lived the spotless life that none of us have lived.
[3507.24 --> 3510.64]  And he died a messy, cruel death.
[3510.78 --> 3511.50]  We deserved.
[3512.36 --> 3513.94]  But he took it on in our place.
[3513.94 --> 3521.28]  And then three days later, he rises again from the grave and he defeats sin and death once and for all.
[3521.32 --> 3526.34]  And he did that so that all who receive him, all who believe in his name,
[3526.64 --> 3531.10]  he gives them the right to be called children of God.
[3531.10 --> 3537.96]  That is the Jesus the Magi humbled themselves and worshipped.
[3539.02 --> 3543.02]  That is the Jesus that Herod fought for power with.
[3544.54 --> 3545.78]  So what about us?
[3548.34 --> 3551.60]  Conclude with this perspective, this challenge perhaps.
[3552.90 --> 3556.46]  We are living in a post-Christian world right now.
[3556.46 --> 3560.70]  We recently looked at the first Peter, the book of first Peter,
[3560.80 --> 3563.60]  where we were called exiles in a pagan land.
[3565.00 --> 3566.34]  That's our reality.
[3568.10 --> 3575.26]  Christendom is in sharp decline and the influence Christianity has on our culture is fading very quickly.
[3576.40 --> 3578.30]  Some think that influence is gone already.
[3579.94 --> 3582.80]  This passage gives us two responses to that.
[3582.80 --> 3586.92]  It gives us two responses to the world that we find ourselves in.
[3588.64 --> 3590.28]  And so which response will we pick?
[3597.68 --> 3603.80]  As Christians, as we Christians lose more and more influence in the world we live in,
[3603.86 --> 3609.10]  as we Christians become more and more powerless against the governing bodies
[3609.10 --> 3611.96]  and the cultural influencers around us,
[3612.80 --> 3618.90]  as we Christians look around and see the world is getting messier and messier every week, it seems,
[3620.30 --> 3624.04]  as all of this is happening in the background or the foreground of your life,
[3625.18 --> 3631.14]  do you come to the manger and worship the baby in the midst of the mess?
[3631.14 --> 3638.76]  Or do you fight for power and for rights and for control and add to the mess?
[3641.20 --> 3643.86]  Are you living as residents of this place,
[3644.68 --> 3648.96]  clawing and scraping for your freedom here in this world?
[3648.96 --> 3652.36]  Or are you living as exiles?
[3653.36 --> 3658.58]  Worshiping Jesus Christ, the Savior, and finding freedom in Him and Him alone?
[3660.24 --> 3664.02]  Are you acting in fear like Herod?
[3665.56 --> 3666.78]  Losing power?
[3668.18 --> 3672.36]  Or are you searching in reverence like the wise men?
[3672.36 --> 3677.18]  In your story, are you the Magi?
[3678.08 --> 3679.24]  Or are you Herod?
[3681.34 --> 3682.38]  Those are the questions.
[3683.28 --> 3686.20]  In our messy world, are we fighting for power?
[3686.66 --> 3689.62]  Or are we worshiping in reverence?
[3691.88 --> 3694.34]  We're un-hallmarking Christmas this Advent season.
[3694.46 --> 3697.28]  We're trying to strip away the romanticized story of Jesus' birth
[3697.28 --> 3699.00]  and see it for what it really is.
[3700.50 --> 3702.48]  If we do that, let's do that with open hearts
[3702.48 --> 3704.14]  and look at our own stories
[3704.14 --> 3707.58]  and maybe strip away some of that romanticism
[3707.58 --> 3708.98]  we put in our own life as well.
[3710.84 --> 3713.76]  Let's open our hearts and worship Jesus.
[3713.96 --> 3716.48]  The world will always want us fighting for power.
[3718.08 --> 3720.84]  Rather than fight, let's search in reverence
[3720.84 --> 3723.92]  for the King who was born for us all,
[3723.98 --> 3727.20]  who came to redeem everything.
[3727.28 --> 3730.46]  And let's worship Him.
[3731.26 --> 3731.56]  Amen?
[3732.50 --> 3733.32]  Let's pray.
[3739.24 --> 3742.94]  Father God, You humbled Yourself in the ultimate way.
[3744.00 --> 3745.40]  And You sent Your Son,
[3747.18 --> 3749.34]  Jesus Christ, who put on flesh,
[3750.36 --> 3752.42]  who made Himself of no reputation
[3752.42 --> 3754.74]  and came to this world
[3754.74 --> 3758.28]  with one intent.
[3759.28 --> 3761.58]  To take on all of our sin,
[3761.68 --> 3762.68]  all of our mess
[3762.68 --> 3765.44]  and atone for it
[3765.44 --> 3766.46]  with His own death
[3766.46 --> 3767.90]  and His own resurrection.
[3770.20 --> 3771.90]  Lord, this world is a mess
[3771.90 --> 3773.58]  and the culture we find ourselves in
[3773.58 --> 3774.56]  can be confusing
[3774.56 --> 3776.56]  and it can be harmful to us
[3776.56 --> 3777.60]  and harmful to others.
[3777.60 --> 3780.46]  Lord, don't let us get distracted
[3780.46 --> 3781.30]  with the mess.
[3782.66 --> 3784.90]  Lord, don't let us fight for power
[3784.90 --> 3785.82]  like Herod did
[3785.82 --> 3788.14]  and miss who You are.
[3789.58 --> 3791.00]  Rather, let us seek You
[3791.00 --> 3792.86]  in reverence like the Magi.
[3793.72 --> 3795.14]  Let us worship You
[3795.14 --> 3796.78]  in the midst of the mess.
[3796.78 --> 3800.20]  May that message ring in our hearts
[3800.20 --> 3801.26]  and may Your Spirit
[3801.26 --> 3803.98]  challenge us with that today.
[3804.78 --> 3805.76]  We pray in Your name.
[3806.36 --> 3806.58]  Amen.
[3806.58 --> 3806.68]  Amen.
[3814.18 --> 3815.66]  Please stand as we sing.
[3815.66 --> 3816.16]  Amen.
[3816.16 --> 3816.66]  Amen.
[3816.66 --> 3817.16]  Amen.
[3817.16 --> 3817.66]  Amen.
[3817.66 --> 3818.66]  Amen.
[3818.66 --> 3819.66]  Amen.
[3819.66 --> 3820.66]  Amen.
[3820.66 --> 3821.66]  Amen.
[3821.66 --> 3822.66]  Amen.
[3822.66 --> 3822.72]  Amen.
[3822.72 --> 3823.72]  Amen.
[3823.72 --> 3823.74]  Amen.
[3826.78 --> 3831.56]  Amen.
[3831.56 --> 3832.42]  Amen.
[3832.42 --> 3833.22]  Amen.
[3833.22 --> 3837.10]  From the slaughter of a borrowed stable
[3837.10 --> 3842.36]  by the spirit and a virgin's faith
[3842.36 --> 3847.80]  to the anguish and the shame of scandal
[3847.80 --> 3853.72]  came the Savior of the human race
[3853.72 --> 3859.68]  But the skies were filled with the praise of heaven
[3859.68 --> 3864.60]  Shepherds, listen as the angels tell
[3864.60 --> 3870.18]  Of the gift of God, come down to man
[3870.18 --> 3874.84]  At the dawning of Emmanuel
[3874.84 --> 3885.80]  King of heaven, now the friend of sinners
[3885.80 --> 3891.08]  Humble servant in the Father's hand
[3891.08 --> 3896.18]  Filled with power and the Holy Spirit
[3896.18 --> 3901.72]  Filled with mercy for the broken man
[3901.72 --> 3908.10]  Yes, he walked my road and he felt my pain
[3908.10 --> 3913.02]  Joys and sorrows that I know so well
[3913.02 --> 3918.54]  Yet his righteous steps give me hope again
[3918.54 --> 3923.34]  I will follow my Emmanuel
[3923.34 --> 3933.60]  Through the kisses of a friend's betrayal
[3933.60 --> 3939.72]  He was lifted on a cruel cross
[3939.72 --> 3945.42]  He was punished for the world's transgressions
[3945.42 --> 3950.86]  He was suffering to save the lost
[3950.86 --> 3957.18]  He fights for breath, he fights for me
[3957.18 --> 3962.14]  Loosing sinners from the claims of hell
[3962.14 --> 3968.00]  And with a shout, our souls are free
[3968.00 --> 3972.56]  Death defeated by Emmanuel
[3972.56 --> 3983.66]  Now he's standing in a place of honor
[3983.66 --> 3989.02]  Browned with glory on the highest throne
[3989.02 --> 3994.14]  Interceding for his own beloved
[3994.14 --> 3999.74]  Till his Father calls to bring him home
[3999.74 --> 4006.42]  Then the skies will part as the trumpet sounds
[4006.42 --> 4011.20]  Hope of heaven or the fear of hell
[4011.20 --> 4017.18]  But the bride will run to her lover's arms
[4017.18 --> 4021.62]  Bringing glory to Emmanuel
[4021.62 --> 4051.56]  You may have a seat
[4051.62 --> 4067.94]  We come together to the table of our Lord
[4067.94 --> 4069.86]  We hear Pastor Kevin's words
[4069.86 --> 4072.94]  That it was the unexpected outsider
[4072.94 --> 4075.06]  Who recognized Jesus
[4075.06 --> 4077.20]  And it was the insider
[4077.20 --> 4079.18]  The one who should have known better
[4079.18 --> 4080.76]  Who missed it
[4080.76 --> 4083.10]  The Gospel of John begins
[4083.10 --> 4084.74]  As Kevin mentioned
[4084.74 --> 4086.60]  That he came to his own
[4086.60 --> 4088.60]  But his own did not recognize him
[4088.60 --> 4091.30]  In the Gospel of Luke
[4091.30 --> 4092.40]  In the 24th chapter
[4092.40 --> 4093.50]  After the resurrection
[4093.50 --> 4096.30]  Jesus is walking on the road to Emmaus
[4096.30 --> 4098.82]  And two of his disciples
[4098.82 --> 4100.58]  Unnamed in that story
[4100.58 --> 4101.90]  Are walking with him
[4101.90 --> 4103.76]  And Jesus' identity was kept
[4103.76 --> 4104.72]  From him
[4104.72 --> 4105.76]  Until
[4105.76 --> 4107.92]  Arriving in the city
[4107.92 --> 4109.28]  He stood before them
[4109.28 --> 4111.32]  And he broke bread
[4111.32 --> 4114.40]  It's at the table
[4114.40 --> 4116.50]  That we recognize
[4116.50 --> 4117.96]  And see
[4117.96 --> 4119.14]  The Lord
[4119.14 --> 4121.92]  We come to this table
[4121.92 --> 4123.70]  So that we might
[4123.70 --> 4124.54]  See
[4124.54 --> 4125.70]  Jesus
[4125.70 --> 4128.80]  This table is for us
[4128.80 --> 4130.78]  So that you who missed him
[4130.78 --> 4133.14]  Might see him
[4133.14 --> 4134.30]  Here
[4134.30 --> 4137.24]  Might receive him
[4137.24 --> 4138.34]  Here
[4138.34 --> 4139.58]  And take him
[4139.58 --> 4140.50]  In
[4140.50 --> 4141.78]  Spiritually
[4141.78 --> 4143.02]  Here
[4143.02 --> 4145.98]  At his last
[4145.98 --> 4146.92]  Supper
[4146.92 --> 4148.72]  The Lord Jesus
[4148.72 --> 4149.64]  Took bread
[4149.64 --> 4152.40]  And when he had given thanks
[4152.40 --> 4154.00]  He broke it and said
[4154.00 --> 4155.54]  This is my body
[4155.54 --> 4157.04]  Which is for you
[4157.04 --> 4158.72]  Do this
[4158.72 --> 4159.88]  In remembrance
[4159.88 --> 4161.36]  Of me
[4161.36 --> 4163.74]  And in the same way
[4163.74 --> 4164.26]  After
[4164.26 --> 4165.24]  Supper
[4165.24 --> 4166.72]  He took the cup
[4166.72 --> 4167.84]  And he said
[4167.84 --> 4168.76]  This cup
[4168.76 --> 4169.94]  Is the new covenant
[4169.94 --> 4171.26]  In my blood
[4171.26 --> 4172.90]  Do this
[4172.90 --> 4173.96]  In remembrance
[4173.96 --> 4174.92]  Of me
[4174.92 --> 4176.14]  For whenever
[4176.14 --> 4178.04]  We eat this bread
[4178.04 --> 4179.84]  And drink this cup
[4179.84 --> 4180.80]  We proclaim
[4180.80 --> 4181.64]  The Lord's death
[4181.64 --> 4183.10]  And his resurrection
[4183.10 --> 4184.28]  Until
[4184.28 --> 4185.44]  He comes
[4185.44 --> 4186.20]  Again
[4186.20 --> 4187.52]  Therefore
[4187.52 --> 4188.42]  We proclaim
[4188.42 --> 4189.62]  Our faith
[4189.62 --> 4190.90]  As signed
[4190.90 --> 4191.76]  And sealed
[4191.76 --> 4192.80]  In this
[4192.80 --> 4193.80]  Sacrament
[4193.80 --> 4202.82]  Church family
[4202.82 --> 4204.28]  The Lord has
[4204.28 --> 4205.10]  Prepared
[4205.10 --> 4206.24]  His table
[4206.24 --> 4206.94]  For all
[4206.94 --> 4208.18]  Who love him
[4208.18 --> 4209.44]  And trust in him
[4209.44 --> 4210.10]  Alone
[4210.10 --> 4211.42]  For their salvation
[4211.42 --> 4212.62]  If you are truly
[4212.62 --> 4214.14]  Sorry for your sins
[4214.14 --> 4214.82]  And sincerely
[4214.82 --> 4216.02]  Believe in the Lord
[4216.02 --> 4217.36]  Jesus as your Savior
[4217.36 --> 4218.72]  And if you desire
[4218.72 --> 4220.04]  To live in obedience
[4220.04 --> 4220.50]  To him
[4220.50 --> 4221.72]  Whether you are here
[4221.72 --> 4222.74]  Gathered with us
[4222.74 --> 4223.92]  Or whether you are present
[4223.92 --> 4225.20]  Digitally at home
[4225.20 --> 4226.40]  You are now invited
[4226.40 --> 4226.98]  To come
[4226.98 --> 4228.26]  With gladness
[4228.26 --> 4229.28]  To the table
[4229.28 --> 4230.52]  Of our Lord
[4230.52 --> 4232.48]  The gifts of God
[4232.48 --> 4233.80]  For the people
[4233.80 --> 4235.14]  Of God
[4235.14 --> 4237.82]  Thongs
[4237.82 --> 4238.60]  Turned to us
[4238.60 --> 4240.56]  Thank you
[4240.56 --> 4240.74]  For now

[4497.10 --> 4500.38]  I want to make sure that everyone who desires to be served has been served.
[4501.58 --> 4503.48]  If not, we have gluten-free bread left.
[4503.48 --> 4505.48]  Thank you.
[4509.48 --> 4512.72]  Body of Christ given for you.
[4513.36 --> 4518.90]  And so take, eat, remember, and believe that the body of our Lord Jesus Christ was given
[4518.90 --> 4523.00]  for the complete forgiveness of all our sins.
[4523.00 --> 4525.00]  Thank you.

[4611.16 --> 4614.70]  The name of Jesus
[4614.70 --> 4625.70]  You didn't want heaven without us
[4625.70 --> 4633.70]  So Jesus you brought heaven down
[4633.70 --> 4638.70]  As soon was greater, love was greater
[4638.70 --> 4645.70]  What could separate us now
[4645.70 --> 4649.70]  What a wonderful name it is

[4713.70 --> 4716.70]  The veil tore before you
[4716.70 --> 4723.70]  You silence the voice of sin and grace
[4723.70 --> 4726.70]  The heavens are roaring
[4726.70 --> 4730.70]  The praise of your glory
[4730.70 --> 4737.70]  For you are raised to life again
[4737.70 --> 4740.70]  You have no rival

[4881.70 --> 4882.70]  Of our Lord Jesus Christ
[4882.70 --> 4883.70]  Was shed
[4883.70 --> 4885.70]  For the complete and absolute

[4910.38 --> 4913.04]  and then we will pray together.
[4914.04 --> 4915.48]  I will lead in prayer
[4915.48 --> 4916.94]  and then we will end that prayer
[4916.94 --> 4919.78]  by receiving God's blessing
[4919.78 --> 4921.12]  before our final song.
[4922.84 --> 4923.78]  Pray together.

[4929.14 --> 4931.62]  we thank you that you have fed us
[4931.62 --> 4933.42]  in this sacrament.
[4934.14 --> 4935.86]  That by it you have united us

[4938.02 --> 4939.82]  and with the church throughout the world
[4939.82 --> 4942.32]  in all times, places and spaces.

[4949.94 --> 4950.82]  And here at this table
[4950.82 --> 4952.74]  you have given us a foretaste
[4952.74 --> 4955.00]  of your heavenly banquet

[4963.54 --> 4967.42]  to be those who worship in the mess.

[4971.48 --> 4973.68]  for the sake of Jesus Christ
[4973.68 --> 4975.70]  in whose name we pray.
[4976.84 --> 4977.12]  Amen.

[4993.36 --> 4994.76]  and cannot feel it,

[4998.78 --> 5000.32]  goes in power.

[5018.90 --> 5019.64]  towards you
[5019.64 --> 5022.78]  and give you his peace.
[5022.78 --> 5024.62]  In this way,
