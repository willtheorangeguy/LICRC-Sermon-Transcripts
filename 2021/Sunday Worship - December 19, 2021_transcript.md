[1759.58 --> 1763.58]  are my heart's desire and I
[1763.58 --> 1765.58]  long to worship
[1765.58 --> 1767.58]  you
[1771.58 --> 1773.58]  please be seated
[1777.58 --> 1787.58]  good morning
[1787.58 --> 1793.58]  this week the offerings are for the church budget and for the Abbotsford flood response
[1793.58 --> 1805.58]  there will also be an opportunity this evening with the choir performance to give to the Abbotsford flood relief as on request of the choir and there will be two deacons standing at the entrance doors to collect any of the church.
[1805.58 --> 1815.58]  We are currently partnering with our sister church gateway CRC who has organized a flood response in partnership with Christian stewardship services.
[1815.58 --> 1819.58]  We'd like to thank those of you who brought goods to the church and those are going to be on their way tomorrow over to gateway and also any other donations that people have given.
[1819.58 --> 1829.58]  The church is donating also a number of leftover gift cards from our reverse offering and that should hopefully help some individuals that are struggling.
[1829.58 --> 1831.58]  Today is the last day for our church collection of goods.
[1831.58 --> 1835.58]  Today is the last day for our church collection of goods but if you do want to still give some things you can always bring them to gateway CRC.
[1835.58 --> 1841.58]  And on the gateway CRC website they have a list of things that they still still need.
[1841.58 --> 1853.58]  On this coming Saturday which is Christmas Day, the special offering will be for the Langley Night Shift Ministry with which members of this church are quite involved.
[1853.58 --> 1869.58]  And then the next week Sunday December 26th the entire offering will be for our church budget.
[1869.58 --> 1883.58]  And as you know we're operating with significant deficit still and we hope to resolve this as best we can before the new year.
[1883.58 --> 1892.58]  Just a reminder if you're giving cash or checks they should be in by the 28th of December in order to have tax receipts for this year.
[1892.58 --> 1896.58]  And electronic payments can be made up till December 31st.
[1896.58 --> 1900.58]  We think of what Jesus said in Luke 6 verse 38.
[1900.58 --> 1903.58]  Give and it will be given to you.
[1903.58 --> 1909.58]  A good measure pressed down shaken together and running over will be poured into your lap.
[1909.58 --> 1914.58]  For with the measure you use it will be measured to you.
[1914.58 --> 1916.58]  Please give generously as the Lord has blessed you.
[1939.58 --> 1948.58]  O Little town of Bethlehem
[1948.58 --> 1953.58]  How still we see thee lie
[1953.58 --> 1964.62]  Above thy deep and streamless sleep, the silent stars go by.
[1964.62 --> 1976.28]  Yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light.
[1976.28 --> 1987.38]  The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.
[1990.14 --> 2001.28]  How silently, how silently the wondrous gift is given.
[2001.28 --> 2012.28]  So God imparts to human hearts the blessings of his love.
[2013.72 --> 2024.28]  No ear may hear his coming, but in this world of sin.
[2024.28 --> 2035.28]  Where meek souls will receive in him the dear Christ's enter sin.
[2035.28 --> 2049.28]  O holy child of Bethlehem, descend to us we pray.
[2049.28 --> 2059.94]  Cast out our sin and enter in, be born in us today.
[2061.28 --> 2071.28]  We hear the Christmas angels, the great glad tidings tell.
[2071.28 --> 2082.28]  O come to us, abide with us, our Lord Emmanuel.
[2082.28 --> 2112.26]  O come to us, our Lord Emmanuel.
[2112.26 --> 2116.72]  Good morning, everybody.
[2119.12 --> 2120.06]  We try that again.
[2120.26 --> 2121.86]  I didn't even hear anybody, I don't think.
[2122.24 --> 2122.84]  Good morning.
[2124.24 --> 2125.16]  There we go.
[2125.22 --> 2125.96]  How are we doing today?
[2126.86 --> 2127.26]  Good.
[2127.54 --> 2128.46]  I have a friend with us.
[2128.50 --> 2129.38]  He's sitting right on this chair.
[2129.46 --> 2129.88]  Do you see him?
[2131.76 --> 2132.34]  That's Hank.
[2132.46 --> 2133.72]  Should we see if he's awake?
[2135.00 --> 2135.36]  Yeah?
[2135.50 --> 2135.70]  Okay.
[2135.78 --> 2136.10]  Let's see.
[2136.10 --> 2142.02]  Hi, everyone.
[2145.30 --> 2146.76]  They're very quiet today.
[2146.90 --> 2147.78]  They are very quiet today.
[2147.78 --> 2148.30]  Should we try again?
[2148.48 --> 2148.76]  Mm-hmm.
[2149.20 --> 2150.02]  Hi, everyone.
[2150.44 --> 2151.84]  Hi, Matt.
[2152.88 --> 2153.64]  Oh, wow.
[2153.70 --> 2154.16]  That's better.
[2154.30 --> 2156.30]  You kids look great.
[2156.30 --> 2162.22]  You don't look great.
[2162.30 --> 2162.54]  What?
[2162.86 --> 2164.30]  What do you mean I don't look great?
[2164.62 --> 2165.74]  What's with the sweater?
[2166.42 --> 2167.20]  I love the sweater.
[2167.26 --> 2169.18]  This is my beautiful Christmas sweater.
[2169.28 --> 2170.82]  I thought I'd wear it today for Kids Corner.
[2172.16 --> 2172.58]  Why?
[2173.44 --> 2177.72]  Well, because Mr. Eric wore his nice Christmas sweater a few weeks ago, and I thought I could
[2177.72 --> 2178.56]  be like Mr. Eric.
[2178.80 --> 2180.50]  Why would you want to be like Mr. Eric?
[2180.50 --> 2182.88]  Well, why wouldn't you want to be like Mr. Eric?
[2183.66 --> 2185.32]  All right.
[2185.44 --> 2191.68]  So, do you kids remember last time when I was up here, we were talking about different gifts
[2191.68 --> 2193.20]  that we get given, right?
[2193.26 --> 2196.26]  And different, oh, different activities we like to do that make us a little bit nervous.
[2196.70 --> 2197.24]  Do you remember that?
[2197.30 --> 2198.06]  What did we talk about?
[2198.80 --> 2198.94]  Yeah?
[2200.14 --> 2201.02]  Roller skating.
[2201.16 --> 2202.92]  And what did Hank really want for Christmas?
[2204.14 --> 2205.04]  Roller skates.
[2205.08 --> 2205.74]  Do you remember, Hank?
[2205.86 --> 2206.24]  Uh-huh.
[2206.48 --> 2208.52]  I really want to learn to roller skate.
[2209.02 --> 2209.48]  I know.
[2209.48 --> 2210.66]  And guess what happened?
[2211.88 --> 2212.94]  He got them.
[2213.44 --> 2216.28]  Someone in the church gave Hank a gift.
[2216.36 --> 2217.48]  Do you want to know who it is, Hank?
[2217.74 --> 2218.08]  Uh-huh.
[2218.36 --> 2219.52]  But don't make it too obvious.
[2219.94 --> 2220.24]  All right.
[2220.52 --> 2222.76]  His name was Penn H.
[2223.10 --> 2223.92]  That's too obvious.
[2224.36 --> 2225.98]  How about Kay Hogawoning?
[2226.20 --> 2226.74]  That's better.
[2227.86 --> 2228.68]  That's your dad.
[2228.78 --> 2229.30]  That's right.
[2229.92 --> 2230.30]  That's right.
[2230.34 --> 2231.48]  We call him the Ken-janeer.
[2232.80 --> 2233.32]  All right.
[2233.34 --> 2236.48]  So, he has whipped together some roller skates for you, Hank.
[2236.52 --> 2237.00]  What do you think?
[2237.16 --> 2237.74]  Oh, all right.
[2237.74 --> 2238.50]  Should we see them?
[2238.50 --> 2239.86]  You guys want to see them?
[2240.32 --> 2241.38]  Yeah, they're right here.
[2241.48 --> 2242.28]  They're wrapped up.
[2244.46 --> 2246.22]  Oh, Amara, we're going to find out.
[2247.02 --> 2247.92]  Look, Hank.
[2249.60 --> 2250.76]  All right.
[2250.90 --> 2251.80]  Should we try them out?
[2252.08 --> 2252.48]  Yeah.
[2252.74 --> 2253.90]  Should we try them out with Hank?
[2254.22 --> 2256.20]  I think Hank wants to go down this ramp.
[2256.32 --> 2256.86]  What do you think?
[2257.72 --> 2258.08]  Yeah?
[2258.24 --> 2259.38]  Should we send Hank down the ramp?
[2259.88 --> 2260.80]  We should ask Hank.
[2261.06 --> 2262.62]  Ask Hank if he wants to go down the ramp.
[2262.88 --> 2263.24]  Yeah.
[2263.24 --> 2263.74]  Yeah.
[2266.06 --> 2266.50]  All right.
[2266.54 --> 2267.48]  Let's try it out, okay?
[2267.56 --> 2268.48]  You guys stay right here.
[2268.76 --> 2270.18]  You can stand up if you want.
[2270.46 --> 2271.10]  Are you ready, Hank?
[2271.24 --> 2271.62]  Mm-hmm.
[2272.00 --> 2273.50]  So, we're going to put them right here.
[2274.96 --> 2276.08]  Oh, I'm so nervous.
[2278.14 --> 2279.00]  Oh, stay up, Hank.
[2279.06 --> 2279.42]  Stay up.
[2279.74 --> 2280.34]  Are you ready, Hank?
[2280.46 --> 2280.84]  Mm-hmm.
[2280.84 --> 2282.16]  I'm a little bit nervous.
[2282.26 --> 2282.58]  Are you?
[2282.82 --> 2284.14]  Yeah, so nervous already.
[2284.60 --> 2286.22]  One, two, three.
[2286.60 --> 2286.86]  Ah!
[2288.68 --> 2289.38]  Oh, no.
[2289.44 --> 2290.04]  He passed out.
[2290.74 --> 2291.64]  Oh, no.
[2292.30 --> 2292.72]  Hank!
[2293.64 --> 2294.90]  Hank, are you okay?
[2295.20 --> 2295.76]  Wake up.
[2296.16 --> 2297.50]  Oh, what happened?
[2298.28 --> 2299.62]  You went down the ramp, Hank.
[2299.96 --> 2300.72]  Was it cool?
[2301.44 --> 2302.00]  Was it cool?
[2302.22 --> 2302.62]  Yeah.
[2302.72 --> 2302.96]  Yeah?
[2303.14 --> 2303.70]  Okay, sit down.
[2303.76 --> 2304.02]  Sit down.
[2304.10 --> 2304.42]  Sit down.
[2305.96 --> 2307.62]  Hank, that was very impressive.
[2307.96 --> 2308.32]  Thanks.
[2309.46 --> 2310.12]  You know what?
[2310.12 --> 2313.58]  We're going to talk about a story today in children's worship time that has to do with
[2313.58 --> 2314.08]  giving gifts.
[2314.84 --> 2315.54]  You are?
[2315.94 --> 2316.62]  We are.
[2317.08 --> 2321.52]  You guys, what Christmas story in the Bible that talks about gifts?
[2321.76 --> 2321.92]  Yeah.
[2324.66 --> 2324.98]  Yeah?
[2325.24 --> 2326.02]  Jesus was born.
[2326.10 --> 2326.46]  That's right.
[2326.56 --> 2327.66]  And who gave him gifts?
[2328.48 --> 2329.38]  The wise men.
[2329.44 --> 2332.10]  We're going to talk about the wise men today in children's worship time, which is handy
[2332.10 --> 2333.62]  because I talked about it last week in real church.
[2334.20 --> 2336.68]  So, I'm just going to preach my sermon to you in children's worship time.
[2336.70 --> 2337.12]  What do you think?
[2337.78 --> 2338.58]  Is that a good idea?
[2338.58 --> 2338.66]  Yeah?
[2339.40 --> 2340.56]  Okay, I'll do a shorter version.
[2341.40 --> 2341.56]  Okay.
[2341.64 --> 2342.06]  Sounds good.
[2342.18 --> 2342.44]  All right.
[2342.66 --> 2343.78]  So, we're going to go out to children's worship time.
[2343.80 --> 2346.78]  We're going to pray and then we'll head off, okay?
[2347.00 --> 2349.10]  And we'll do the children's blessing first and then we'll head off.
[2349.18 --> 2349.54]  Sound good?
[2350.28 --> 2350.92]  Sound good, Hank?
[2351.08 --> 2351.36]  Mm-hmm.
[2351.60 --> 2351.94]  All right.
[2351.98 --> 2352.28]  Here we go.
[2352.32 --> 2352.66]  Let's pray.
[2352.82 --> 2353.28]  Hold your hands.
[2353.38 --> 2353.74]  Close your eyes.
[2353.78 --> 2354.04]  Let's pray.
[2354.32 --> 2355.52]  God, thank you so much for this day.
[2355.90 --> 2359.34]  Thank you that it's the season of Advent that we can wait for Christmas, which is happening
[2359.34 --> 2359.78]  this week.
[2359.86 --> 2364.68]  We pray that you'll be with us in children's worship time or as we stay back in church, help us just
[2364.68 --> 2366.90]  learn more about you with open ears and hearts.
[2366.90 --> 2367.74]  We pray this in your name.
[2367.92 --> 2368.10]  Amen.
[2368.92 --> 2369.18]  All right.
[2369.24 --> 2369.82]  Say bye, Hank.
[2370.00 --> 2370.64]  Bye, Hank.
[2371.60 --> 2372.12]  All right.
[2372.36 --> 2372.90]  Stand up.
[2372.96 --> 2373.34]  Bye, Hank.
[2373.54 --> 2376.82]  We're going to do the children's blessing first.
[2376.90 --> 2377.62]  So, hands up.
[2378.36 --> 2378.58]  Ready?
[2378.68 --> 2379.30]  Hands up.
[2380.22 --> 2381.16]  You ready to say it with me?
[2381.22 --> 2381.80]  Let's say it together.
[2382.62 --> 2384.98]  The Lord be with you.
[2386.82 --> 2387.26]  All right.
[2387.30 --> 2387.80]  Let's head off.
[2387.80 --> 2388.72]  Let's head off.
[2388.72 --> 2392.80]  Let's head off.
[2396.90 --> 2415.22]  Wow.
[2415.22 --> 2416.36]  That's tough to beat.
[2416.36 --> 2420.44]  I got to amp up my game next time I do children's worship.
[2420.44 --> 2421.80]  So, I got lots to think about.
[2421.90 --> 2422.34]  Thanks, Kevin.
[2424.04 --> 2426.08]  Thanks, Mary, for the reminder about the budget.
[2426.20 --> 2426.94]  I was going to do that.
[2427.06 --> 2432.76]  So, hopefully you all heard that from Mary about we're still looking for some more contributions
[2432.76 --> 2434.38]  to the budget for the end of the year.
[2434.50 --> 2436.82]  So, please prayerfully consider that.
[2438.88 --> 2441.08]  Now it's time for the family prayer.
[2441.12 --> 2445.24]  I just want to make a couple notes for people that's been kind of on my mind.
[2445.24 --> 2451.34]  It always seems like this is a great time of the year, but also it's a difficult time
[2451.34 --> 2451.82]  for many.
[2452.82 --> 2456.64]  In our own community here, many have lost loved ones in the last year.
[2456.72 --> 2462.34]  I can think of Harvey lost his dad and Karen, she wasn't there, lost her dad.
[2463.02 --> 2469.00]  Of course, Alexander's, the Miles lost a couple people in their family.
[2469.12 --> 2472.08]  Of course, we always think of Dave Alexander's family, the Alexanders.
[2472.08 --> 2476.50]  So, we got to keep those people in mind because this is a difficult time of the year for those
[2476.50 --> 2477.46]  folks.
[2479.76 --> 2483.80]  And also, those have lost loved ones in years past, and when you get together at Christmas,
[2483.94 --> 2486.66]  it's always a difficult time because there's someone missing in the room.
[2489.92 --> 2493.62]  I'm assuming, I talked to some people this week, that the travel restrictions and all
[2493.62 --> 2497.08]  the COVID restrictions have prevented some families from getting together at Christmas
[2497.08 --> 2497.50]  as well.
[2497.60 --> 2500.26]  So, that's something that is on people's minds as well.
[2500.26 --> 2506.56]  I know in our own home also, there's broken relationships that sometimes make Christmas
[2506.56 --> 2507.68]  time difficult too.
[2508.56 --> 2514.80]  Maybe family members don't want to be hanging out or when you are together can be a little
[2514.80 --> 2515.36]  bit difficult.
[2515.52 --> 2518.22]  So, I think we should be thinking about that as well.
[2519.58 --> 2523.80]  And maybe for 2021, it's been a rough, rough year and you're looking forward to 2022 and
[2523.80 --> 2524.84]  want to put this year behind.
[2524.96 --> 2525.08]  Yeah.
[2525.14 --> 2526.88]  So, that's something we can think about too.
[2526.88 --> 2531.86]  Also, some great things about Christmas as well, getting together with friends and family
[2531.86 --> 2534.08]  can also be a joyous occasion.
[2534.22 --> 2535.64]  So, we were thankful for that as well.
[2537.16 --> 2544.24]  In our church, there's not too many prayer concerns, but Miriam DeWinter, Pastor Chris's
[2544.24 --> 2545.96]  mom had some eye surgery this week.
[2546.04 --> 2548.12]  According to Chris, she's doing well.
[2548.34 --> 2548.94]  She's doing good.
[2548.94 --> 2554.24]  She is going to have to relax this Christmas, I hear, because normally she likes to do a
[2554.24 --> 2555.26]  lot of things around the house.
[2555.36 --> 2558.80]  But now she's going to have to relax and let others do a lot of the heavy lifting.
[2558.92 --> 2559.50]  So, that's good.
[2559.56 --> 2560.30]  She gets to relax.
[2560.74 --> 2566.92]  And I think we should still keep in our minds and thoughts as the Abbotsford flood victims,
[2567.10 --> 2569.18]  there's still a lot of cleanup and work to be done there.
[2569.36 --> 2572.92]  So, with that, we'll go to God in prayer.
[2572.92 --> 2578.18]  Dear God, what a beautiful morning we were welcomed to this morning.
[2579.50 --> 2584.74]  The bright sun, the bright blue sky, the frosty landscape are a great reminder of your steadfast
[2584.74 --> 2585.14]  presence.
[2586.06 --> 2590.74]  We thank you for the opportunity we have in this country to worship you here freely together
[2590.74 --> 2591.80]  with all our friends.
[2592.68 --> 2597.36]  And we are grateful for technology so those at home can still participate this morning.
[2597.36 --> 2600.96]  Lord, we are thankful for this Advent season.
[2601.30 --> 2605.04]  As we work our way through these last couple weeks before the anniversary of your birth,
[2605.12 --> 2609.60]  we are reminded of your great gift of your son Jesus to us many years ago.
[2610.58 --> 2617.10]  The message Jesus brought of hope, love, forgiveness, and peace to all who follow him is so special.
[2618.34 --> 2624.02]  But we worry, Lord, about the eroding of Christianity in our world and the secularization of our world
[2624.02 --> 2627.04]  by the media, social media, and just culture in general.
[2628.12 --> 2633.24]  Help us to be strong and convicted and give us the strength and determination to fight
[2633.24 --> 2635.70]  back and be a light for you in the darkness.
[2637.48 --> 2642.36]  Lord, this is a great time of year for taking a break from work, sports, and other commitments
[2642.36 --> 2645.48]  that consume a lot of our time and mental space.
[2646.26 --> 2651.90]  Help us to refuel and refocus as we prepare for the regular schedule of life in the new year.
[2651.90 --> 2657.78]  We pray for all to have an enjoyable time with friends and family this Christmas season.
[2659.20 --> 2662.28]  But for some, this time of the year is not a great time of the year.
[2662.84 --> 2668.62]  Some notice a missing person at family functions due to recent loss or a loss in years past.
[2669.30 --> 2674.16]  Some of us are sad because of broken relationships and families that prevent families from getting together
[2674.16 --> 2676.74]  or disharmony when they do get together.
[2677.74 --> 2682.30]  Some of us may be frustrated because of the hope of seeing family has been crushed
[2682.30 --> 2685.40]  by the restrictions put on travel, vaccinations, or illness.
[2686.36 --> 2689.74]  We pray, Lord, for healing for those broken relationships.
[2689.74 --> 2695.36]  And hope for those who have loved ones and those who cannot see their loved ones this Christmas.
[2697.16 --> 2701.38]  Lord, we ask special prayer for those in our community that are lonely and shut in.
[2702.44 --> 2705.64]  We pray for those who suffer from physical and mental illness.
[2706.38 --> 2709.86]  Because we know those issues do not take a break at this time of the year.
[2710.98 --> 2715.14]  We pray for those in Abbotsford who are recovering from the floods from a few weeks back.
[2715.14 --> 2720.22]  And Lord, we want to thank you for our staff here at Emanuel.
[2720.50 --> 2723.54]  Chris, Kevin, Sylvia, Marilyn, Josh, and Grace.
[2723.78 --> 2727.56]  Thank you for the work they put in here at Emanuel.
[2727.88 --> 2730.68]  Thank you for all our volunteers that make this church function.
[2731.50 --> 2736.30]  Especially those that take on leadership roles or roles that require a lot of time commitment.
[2737.80 --> 2742.48]  Lord, we ask that you continue to guide and give wisdom to the leadership team at this church.
[2742.48 --> 2746.62]  And Lord, we pray for a great day today.
[2747.44 --> 2751.64]  Please bless Mark and the choir tonight as they do their performance and that all goes well.
[2752.78 --> 2756.32]  And Lord, help us to go into the world in our community and in our orbit.
[2756.52 --> 2759.08]  And give the energy and odor that comes from following you.
[2760.22 --> 2761.70]  In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[2761.70 --> 2761.80]  Amen.
[2772.48 --> 2788.40]  We are going to continue in our Advent and Christmas teaching series this morning,
[2788.40 --> 2794.74]  Unhallmark Christmas, by looking at the birth story of Jesus.
[2794.90 --> 2797.30]  And so we're going to read from Luke 2.
[2797.76 --> 2800.72]  We'll do the first seven verses there.
[2800.72 --> 2804.18]  I encourage you to have a Bible.
[2804.34 --> 2804.74]  Find that.
[2804.82 --> 2805.18]  Open it up.
[2805.22 --> 2807.12]  It will be on the screen as we go through it.
[2808.56 --> 2814.16]  Before I jump into the text, let me offer this to you.
[2815.00 --> 2817.76]  I've really enjoyed this particular series.
[2818.18 --> 2823.66]  And I've enjoyed your feedback and the engagement that Pastor Kevin and I both have been getting from you.
[2823.66 --> 2831.56]  As we sort of expand our awareness of what actually happened in the Christmas story.
[2833.36 --> 2837.08]  Kevin mentioned it last week briefly and I'll reiterate it here.
[2837.22 --> 2844.58]  But it's really important for us to start with the text and to look what is actually said in the text.
[2844.58 --> 2862.84]  And then from there begin to extrapolate meaning or the story because it is really easy for different outside sources and influences to impose ideas and images and structures on these stories.
[2862.84 --> 2870.62]  In a way that because they've happened for so long really slip past our critical defenses.
[2870.94 --> 2874.32]  That is our engagement and thinking about what we are hearing.
[2874.32 --> 2886.40]  And so as I read this text, I want you to pay particular attention to what's there, but more importantly, what's not.
[2888.04 --> 2889.74]  And so think of your Christmas nativities.
[2890.04 --> 2890.94]  Think of your stories.
[2891.22 --> 2892.68]  Think of everything you hear.
[2892.94 --> 2898.08]  And think of the different places you visited in the last week that have displayed these sorts of things.
[2898.08 --> 2928.06]  Think of everything you have.
[2928.08 --> 2958.06]  Think of everything you have.
[2958.08 --> 2963.54]  Think of everything you have.
[2965.72 --> 2967.12]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2969.96 --> 2977.82]  Now before we get into the particulars of this story and of this text, I want to do two things.
[2977.92 --> 2983.12]  One, I want to acknowledge my own sort of anxiety right now.
[2983.12 --> 2991.44]  because I'm not afraid, but I'm intrigued as to how what I am about to share with you and the
[2991.44 --> 2997.08]  actual history of these events is going to shatter your cute little hallmarked story of Christmas
[2997.08 --> 3003.74]  and the impact that that might have on you. And so being aware of that, I don't want to run from
[3003.74 --> 3008.76]  it, but I want to press into it. And so if you want to disagree with me or if you want to fight
[3008.76 --> 3013.68]  me after the service, I will be in the foyer ready to go after the school bell.
[3017.32 --> 3025.20]  But second to that, I also want to begin for a moment just by saying that it really matters
[3025.20 --> 3034.60]  that we actually get the history right. Right? Some of us go through this season of Christmas
[3034.60 --> 3040.78]  or really we go through our experience of Christianity and faith more generally by
[3040.78 --> 3048.96]  saying, isn't it just enough that we have some sort of contemplative experience of Christmas?
[3050.00 --> 3055.62]  Let me put it this way. Some of us might say, you know, if our experience of Christmas, of the
[3055.62 --> 3062.22]  celebrations and the decorations, if our experience of faith and the songs of faith and the movements
[3062.22 --> 3067.24]  of worship together, if that all comes together to make me feel good, isn't that enough?
[3068.94 --> 3070.54]  Isn't that the purpose of it anyway?
[3072.90 --> 3079.72]  Does the historicity of the thing, and by that I mean does the historical rootedness of it,
[3080.44 --> 3081.34]  make a difference?
[3083.10 --> 3087.96]  I want to play with this idea by way of our introduction for a moment with you because
[3087.96 --> 3095.82]  I think that it actually really does matter. And I think that the underlying assumption
[3095.82 --> 3101.02]  that is there for most of us, not just around Christmas, but actually, like I've said, for
[3101.02 --> 3106.98]  our entire relationship to faith and our entire experience of worship or church or God.
[3107.98 --> 3116.94]  Right? How often do we make our feelings of things, our experience of them, the arbiter of how true they are?
[3117.96 --> 3119.28]  Or how true they are for me?
[3121.12 --> 3127.38]  Right? How often do we elevate our experience of something to the point of determining the value
[3127.38 --> 3128.40]  of that thing?
[3130.32 --> 3135.82]  Think about it, okay? There was, I know that this is true for me. There was a time in my life
[3135.82 --> 3145.84]  where I would say, faith isn't real. Christianity isn't true, good, or beautiful because I don't
[3145.84 --> 3154.50]  experience it that way. I don't feel anything, so there must be nothing to feel. Right? Or the common
[3154.50 --> 3163.74]  teenager trope, I don't get anything out of it, so why bother? Right? In our minds, in our therapeutic
[3163.74 --> 3171.54]  language and culture, we equate the truth of a thing with our experience of it, with the feelings that
[3171.54 --> 3179.34]  are generated by it. Pardon the quip here, but it's an elevated form, sort of the idea that if it feels
[3179.34 --> 3184.72]  good, do it. Right? And now, it's sort of become, if it makes you feel good, believe it. If it makes
[3184.72 --> 3189.72]  you feel good, practice it. If it makes you feel good, love it. Right? And if it doesn't produce joy or
[3189.72 --> 3197.46]  sentiment or feelings, leave it behind. Get rid of it. In a very real way, in our culture, we've sort of
[3197.46 --> 3203.96]  Marie Kondo'd not just our living rooms, but our faith and religion and truth.
[3206.16 --> 3209.96]  And let me be really clear, because some of you are hearing this and you're dismissing this as
[3209.96 --> 3216.80]  something that other people do. Say, no, I am perfectly rational. You do it. All of you.
[3218.10 --> 3223.96]  Everyone. Myself as well. The question for our reflection this morning isn't if we do this,
[3223.96 --> 3232.12]  but in what way and to what degree. And as you think about your own life, think about this.
[3233.50 --> 3243.36]  If the value or the truth of Christmas or of Christianity is determined by your pleasant
[3243.36 --> 3251.68]  feelings about it or during it, what about the rest of us, like for whom Eric prayed this morning,
[3251.68 --> 3260.26]  who don't feel pleasant right now. Right? For some of you, this is the first Christmas without mom.
[3261.66 --> 3267.62]  Right? This is the first Christmas season without your husband. Many of us aren't going to see
[3267.62 --> 3272.54]  family this year, whether because of COVID or floods and highway closures or new restrictions.
[3272.54 --> 3280.44]  Some of us haven't seen brothers or sisters or sons or daughters in years because relationships
[3280.44 --> 3290.26]  are broken. And Christmas is a reminder of that brokenness. What about then? What about when it's
[3290.26 --> 3296.46]  not a holly jolly Christmas or when it's not the most wonderful time of the year? Is there still a truth
[3296.46 --> 3304.42]  that matters even when we don't experience it or feel particularly appreciative of it?
[3306.76 --> 3311.70]  Let's zoom out just a little bit here because you can even think about this sort of liturgically,
[3311.84 --> 3317.64]  right? Liturgically is a word that we use to talk about the movements and the intentionality of our
[3317.64 --> 3325.58]  worship together, the rhythms of worship. Think liturgically about this season. Why do so many of
[3325.58 --> 3332.52]  us want to rush through Advent in order to get to Christmas? Right? We want to skip the come thou
[3332.52 --> 3340.70]  long expected Jesus and get right to the joy to the world. The anxiety of waiting in darkness can be
[3340.70 --> 3348.36]  uncomfortable and discouraging and awkward and hard. And so we jump straight to the peace on earth for
[3348.36 --> 3358.20]  those on whom his favor rests. But again, thinking liturgically, right? Advent is there to form us
[3358.20 --> 3366.68]  into the sort of people who can look through the darkness at the light to come, right? Advent, with its
[3366.68 --> 3373.48]  anxiety and waiting and sense of longing, right, is not actually all that dissimilar to Holy Saturday.
[3373.48 --> 3380.04]  You know what Holy Saturday is? Holy Saturday is that day that exists between the cross of Good Friday
[3380.04 --> 3388.82]  and the empty tomb of Easter Sunday. That day where we are just waiting, not exactly sure what's going
[3388.82 --> 3398.14]  to happen next. We're hope-filled, but we're also mourning, right? Advent, like Holy Saturday, is more
[3398.14 --> 3404.30]  accurately for most of us the kind of season of life and faith that we spend most of our time in,
[3405.02 --> 3412.90]  right? Zoom out in this picture to the whole drama of redemption, right? Where we are now waiting after
[3412.90 --> 3419.04]  Jesus' first coming and waiting for his second. We are waiting between his resurrection and the
[3419.04 --> 3425.44]  resurrection of all to incorruptible and imperishable. We are in the already, not yet. We are waiting in the
[3425.44 --> 3430.64]  truth that Jesus has been exalted to the highest place and has been given the name that is above
[3430.64 --> 3439.14]  every name, but still our battle is not against flesh and blood, but against the powers and principalities
[3439.14 --> 3447.50]  and the rulers of this dark age. In many ways, the season of Advent is our ordinary time,
[3447.50 --> 3457.22]  and to endure in the waiting, to survive in the anxiety of the unknown. It matters that our faith
[3457.22 --> 3466.48]  and that our experience of faith is based on more than just experience. Christmas specifically,
[3466.78 --> 3475.22]  and Christianity more broadly, is based on more than particular sentimental feelings. Christmas,
[3475.22 --> 3482.90]  Christianity, is rooted in history, and that's why it's true, and not just for me, and not just when
[3482.90 --> 3496.64]  it feels true, but always, and for everyone. And so, getting the story right matters. Separating the history
[3496.64 --> 3504.74]  from the hallmark matters. And our goal this season has been to un-hallmark Christmas because,
[3505.24 --> 3513.40]  in reality, a hallmarked Christmas misses the point and will ultimately disappoint. A hallmarked,
[3513.40 --> 3519.74]  sentimental Christmas and Christianity doesn't cut it. It won't stand up under the weight of the
[3519.74 --> 3526.60]  oppression of the oppression of ordinary life. If you want a truth that lasts all year, it needs to be
[3526.60 --> 3532.74]  one that actually took place. If you want a truth that will transform your life, it needs to be one that
[3532.74 --> 3543.62]  is rooted in history. The merely sentimental fades away. The accurate and the historical changes you
[3543.62 --> 3554.66]  because by it, God has changed history. So, as we come to this text and this story, know that this has been
[3554.66 --> 3564.28]  Luke's precise point throughout. Luke understands this purpose, the necessity of seeing the gospel story
[3564.28 --> 3572.86]  of Jesus as rooted in history and that the Christian faith as historically grounded. With your Bible
[3572.86 --> 3581.06]  open, before we look at Luke 2, look at the first verses of Luke 1, the opening verses of Luke 1.
[3582.44 --> 3590.94]  This is before the journey to Bethlehem and the inn and the manger, first opening verses. Luke gives this
[3590.94 --> 3597.54]  introduction. He writes, many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled
[3597.54 --> 3605.26]  among us, just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants
[3605.26 --> 3612.72]  of the word. With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning,
[3613.22 --> 3620.50]  I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know
[3620.50 --> 3630.92]  the certainty of the things you have been taught. Luke says, many have undertaken. So, he's giving his
[3630.92 --> 3637.56]  method there. He's saying, I have compared the statements. I have verified the truth. And Luke is
[3637.56 --> 3645.10]  inviting you into the work of discernment, right? He is saying, there are ways to test and approve
[3645.10 --> 3653.46]  what you will read here. So, do it. Do the work and you will see that this actually happened.
[3654.80 --> 3661.48]  And he says that he has communicated with eyewitnesses and servants of the word, right? Luke did that work.
[3661.58 --> 3667.62]  He talked to the eyewitnesses. He talked to people with firsthand experience and a commitment to the
[3667.62 --> 3674.76]  accuracy of this revelation. And he recorded that for us. He, what did he say? Carefully investigated.
[3676.50 --> 3683.54]  Luke, you've heard me say before, is no slouch. He is a doctor, a trained professional. He knows who to study
[3683.54 --> 3689.78]  and how to study. He knows what it means to learn and to research and to fact check. He knows how to check his
[3689.78 --> 3696.70]  sources. He would have had a standard of excellency and accuracy to the kind of work that he does.
[3696.70 --> 3701.90]  And he does all of this work, all of this careful investigation, all of this interviewing
[3701.90 --> 3708.86]  the eyewitnesses and looking at the multiple sources. He does it all so that you may know the
[3708.86 --> 3717.86]  certainty of the things you have been taught. Luke wants you to know that this is a foundational truth.
[3718.56 --> 3726.68]  In fact, that word that is translated certainty there in verse 4 is a word that is
[3726.68 --> 3735.34]  used by the Greek translators of the Old Testament for Psalm 104 verse 5. Right? Psalm 104 verse 5 says,
[3735.48 --> 3743.84]  he set the earth on its foundation. The same Greek word that's used. Right? This is a foundational
[3743.84 --> 3754.46]  truth. It is rock solid. It is immovable. It actually happened. Luke's task is history. His method is
[3754.46 --> 3762.82]  credible and his purpose is your assurance. Right? The certainty of your faith because it is rooted in
[3762.82 --> 3771.22]  and founded upon. It is built on the foundation of history. Not on how you may or may not be feeling
[3771.22 --> 3777.32]  right now or in a few moments when I shatter your picture of the nativity scene.
[3777.32 --> 3785.74]  The historical purpose and credibility then of Luke is carried right into our text.
[3786.68 --> 3790.28]  He opens chapter 2 by saying,
[3790.28 --> 3802.12]  This is the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor. Right? This, again,
[3802.44 --> 3810.12]  firmly roots us in history. Demonstrable, falsifiable, witnessed history.
[3810.12 --> 3820.70]  The Roman emperor at this time is Caesar Augustus, also known as Octavian. Octavian took the name
[3820.70 --> 3830.56]  Augustus and he ruled from 27 BC through AD 14. Octavian, as Caesar Augustus, is widely recognized
[3830.56 --> 3839.98]  in history as one of the great administrative geniuses of history. Right? After his great uncle and
[3839.98 --> 3845.50]  adoptive stepfather, a man by the name of Julius Caesar, you might have heard of him, after he died,
[3845.50 --> 3852.56]  the empire is left in a political disarray and there are claimants to power from Egypt all the way around
[3852.56 --> 3859.18]  the world. And Augustus, Octavian, pulls it all together into what we now call the Pax Romana,
[3859.32 --> 3868.24]  the Peace of Rome. Quirinius is also another figure that we can verify from sources outside of the Bible.
[3868.24 --> 3874.02]  In fact, we know that he was appointed over Syria and that the province of Judah,
[3874.40 --> 3883.38]  will not officially part and included in his rule, was added later in order that he might exercise this
[3883.38 --> 3891.92]  census, that he might begin to assert more dominant Roman control. Augustus tells Quirinius
[3891.92 --> 3898.94]  that he wants to assess the region for taxes. And so Quirinius says, well, we need to do a census
[3898.94 --> 3910.06]  in order to accomplish that. Again, history. We are rooted in history. And so, Joseph, who is pledged
[3910.06 --> 3920.56]  to be married to Mary, goes back to his historical family hometown of Bethlehem, because that is David's
[3920.56 --> 3931.48]  town and he is, as Luke writes, of the line and the family of David. And then we get this part of the
[3931.48 --> 3938.18]  story and picture it in your mind as you hear it. While they were there, the time came for the baby to be
[3938.18 --> 3944.26]  born and she gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in cloths, placed him in a manger,
[3944.38 --> 3950.72]  because there was no guest room available for them. Now, if like me, you grew up with an older
[3950.72 --> 3956.40]  translation of the Bible, you will remember that line as, because there was no room for them in the
[3956.40 --> 3966.10]  inn. Thank you. And then your imagination takes over and it starts to fill in all sorts of details.
[3966.10 --> 3970.28]  Now, notice, right, we started with what does the text say and what does the text not say.
[3970.54 --> 3976.16]  We have two sentences in the story, but in your mind and in your imaginations, there's a whole movie
[3976.16 --> 3982.38]  or countless movies to flush out the details. Right, what time is it in your mind?
[3984.12 --> 3993.88]  It's nighttime, right? Mary is about to pop and Joseph is going from hotel to hotel down main street
[3993.88 --> 3998.64]  of Bethlehem and the shop owners keep turning him away, saying, sorry, we're all booked out. The no
[3998.64 --> 4004.62]  vacancy signs are hung. And finally, there's an innkeeper who takes pity on them and he says, oh,
[4004.62 --> 4010.14]  I have a barn out back. Right, or just outside the village, maybe there's a cave that you can go stay
[4010.14 --> 4015.92]  in. And so quickly, Mary and Joseph go, because Mary is giving birth. Jesus is crowning.
[4015.92 --> 4024.54]  And she takes him and places him in a manger, an animal feeding trough.
[4026.08 --> 4031.70]  And then, of course, Jesus sleeps quietly, right? No crying he makes because he wasn't really a human
[4031.70 --> 4039.10]  baby. And then the shepherds show up in this random barn somewhere. And then you have the story.
[4040.00 --> 4044.20]  Right, that's the one that we're familiar with. There's a little bit of intrigue. There's a little bit
[4044.20 --> 4050.84]  of drama, not a lot of trauma. And it all fits nicely on the cover of a Christmas card, carved out
[4050.84 --> 4058.48]  of wood, displayed on your mantle year after year after year. Now, like I said, in some versions of the
[4058.48 --> 4063.82]  story, and this is becoming more popular now, you might hear that Jesus was born in a stable, but not
[4063.82 --> 4070.52]  one made of wood, but actually it was a cave. Right, and while it is likely that stables outside of the
[4070.52 --> 4078.10]  town were actually cut into caves, this itself is not the unhallmarked version of the story that I want
[4078.10 --> 4091.00]  you to hear. So, first, think about this. From these two verses, with just the bare facts, right, that they
[4091.00 --> 4095.72]  were there, the baby was ready to be born, and he was placed in a manger, that there was no room
[4095.72 --> 4103.50]  in the inn or guest room. More on that in a moment. We have created a whole drama, and we have filled in
[4103.50 --> 4110.00]  a lot of details to flush out the narrative. And honestly, like doing that, that we have done that,
[4110.06 --> 4116.86]  that history and culture have done that, makes sense. Because we love good stories, and good stories
[4116.86 --> 4123.00]  have drama and intrigue. Good stories have something to overcome, and they have a bit of a fool, who in this
[4123.00 --> 4127.42]  case might be Joseph, because he should have prepared better, and they have a hero, who in this case,
[4127.50 --> 4138.92]  obviously, is Jesus, because he's the Messiah. But you've got to ask, at the risk of changing a good
[4138.92 --> 4150.66]  story, or unhallmarking Christmas, why this story, why this particular intrigue? And so,
[4150.66 --> 4163.90]  dig with me for a moment into this text, and this story. I want to start with that word. We'll start
[4163.90 --> 4171.16]  at the end in verse 7. There was no guest room available for them, right? No inn available.
[4172.50 --> 4178.10]  And in the Bible, like all literature, right, when you want to understand what a word means,
[4178.10 --> 4183.50]  you look at the other places that that word is used. Now, the word that's used here, and you don't
[4183.50 --> 4190.02]  have to remember this, but in Greek, it's katalumati, it means guest room. The only other place that the
[4190.02 --> 4198.20]  word is used is actually by Jesus, when he sends his disciples into Jerusalem, looking for a room which
[4198.20 --> 4203.82]  he can celebrate the Passover in, with his disciples, right? That final day before his crucifixion.
[4203.82 --> 4210.78]  In both Luke and Mark, where that story is told, the same word is used, and again, in both places,
[4211.10 --> 4217.46]  they offer a meaning of that word. So, he says, go look for a guest room wherein we can celebrate
[4217.46 --> 4225.32]  the Passover, and there you will find an upper room, right? It defines it for us as an upper room.
[4225.32 --> 4234.02]  I want to suggest to you that it's this same sense that Luke is using the word in for the Christmas
[4234.02 --> 4240.78]  story. Now, maybe it's not an upper room, but it is a guest room, right, or a prophet's room
[4240.78 --> 4248.62]  attached to the main living area of a house in Bethlehem. I'm going to give you three reasons why
[4248.62 --> 4254.74]  I think this is so, two from the text itself, and then one from the architecture and the structure
[4254.74 --> 4261.36]  of family and homes that we know from that day, from the archaeological evidence. The first one,
[4261.98 --> 4266.66]  the first argument for this, and in favor of what I think is the right way to understand it,
[4266.98 --> 4272.98]  comes from the text. The only other time this word is used is regarding this sort of
[4272.98 --> 4280.52]  second story upper room or a guest room. Now, sometimes this room was called a prophet's
[4280.52 --> 4286.86]  chamber. Now, that comes out of the story of Elijah raising back to life the son of the widow
[4286.86 --> 4292.86]  at Zarephath, right, in the upper room where he was staying. That's 1 Kings 17, 19.
[4294.48 --> 4302.74]  In fact, if Luke meant an inn, like a public accommodation house with multiple rooms,
[4302.98 --> 4309.08]  there is a word for that in Greek. Maybe you remember the story of the Good Samaritan,
[4309.58 --> 4316.40]  right, that Jesus tells. Luke writes that the Good Samaritan took the injured man to an inn
[4316.40 --> 4324.14]  where he paid the innkeeper to care for him until he returned. The word that Luke uses in that story
[4324.14 --> 4332.42]  that Jesus tells is different than the word that Luke uses here. Because he doesn't use that word,
[4332.98 --> 4338.12]  I think it's probable that he does use a word with intentionality.
[4340.08 --> 4347.98]  Two, from the text again, there is a small possibility that within the meaning of this word
[4347.98 --> 4355.30]  that Luke can mean a sort of crude shelter for animals or people. And that might be what you
[4355.30 --> 4361.18]  imagine in your hallmark version of the story. The problem with that is, even if that's what it does
[4361.18 --> 4368.52]  mean, is that Luke says there's no room for them in that place. Right, that the crude stable or stall,
[4368.92 --> 4373.84]  the cave, and we'll come back to that again, right, is precisely where there is no room.
[4375.54 --> 4381.82]  And so it begs the question, where did they go? Where was their room?
[4381.82 --> 4389.34]  And that's the third point, the point from architecture and archaeology. And for a lot of
[4389.34 --> 4396.06]  this, I'm summarizing the work of a scholar named Kenneth Bailey. If you're interested in this or want
[4396.06 --> 4400.50]  to follow up more, I can send you a copy of his chapter on this. It was really helpful to me. It's a
[4400.50 --> 4410.06]  fascinating read. First of all, notice that Luke makes a very precise point of saying that Joseph
[4410.06 --> 4422.24]  belongs to the house and the line of David. Right, he repeats there. Not just the house, right, this isn't
[4422.24 --> 4432.80]  just his hometown, but he's also in the line of the king. He is coming to the town of David. Now, that's
[4432.80 --> 4440.30]  important because Jerusalem, right, a few kilometers away from Bethlehem, Jerusalem, especially the old
[4440.30 --> 4448.20]  city, is often called the city of David because it was David who first conquered that city. But it is
[4448.20 --> 4455.72]  Bethlehem where David is from. His roots go there. And so scholars have suggested that Bethlehem being
[4455.72 --> 4463.36]  called the town of David is a sort of a colloquialism. It's a local phrase that everyone who lived there
[4463.36 --> 4469.34]  would know and they would use and they would wear it as a badge of honor because they are connected to
[4469.34 --> 4478.12]  Israel's greatest king. And so Joseph of the house and the line of David is coming back to the
[4478.12 --> 4485.36]  town of David. Now, in the Middle East and in the ancient Near East, Palestine and Jewish culture, no
[4485.36 --> 4494.32]  exception to this, family history and lineage mattered, right? There's a reason why both Luke and Matthew
[4494.32 --> 4503.50]  include a genealogy. In reality, a man like Joseph would have shown up in Bethlehem and he would have said,
[4503.50 --> 4511.28]  I am Joseph, son of Heli, son of Methat, son of Levi, and because of the hospitality culture of that day,
[4511.58 --> 4514.64]  most every single home would have opened up to him.
[4517.86 --> 4529.18]  Also, in just about every culture, but especially in Jewish cultures, a woman about to give birth is given
[4529.18 --> 4536.02]  special attention, right? She's cared for. And so in smaller towns and in rural communities like
[4536.02 --> 4543.38]  Bethlehem, a midwife or a whole group of women would come and they would assist someone who is in labor,
[4544.46 --> 4548.10]  right? Someone who is about to give birth. Bailey concludes,
[4548.10 --> 4553.88]  that surely the whole community would have sensed its responsibility to help Joseph find
[4553.88 --> 4560.72]  adequate shelter for Mary and provide the care she needed. To turn away a descendant of David in the
[4560.72 --> 4566.16]  city of David would be an unspeakable shame on the entire village.
[4568.16 --> 4573.60]  Finally, notice what the text actually says. Verse 4,
[4574.66 --> 4581.44]  So Joseph went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem, to the town of David,
[4581.44 --> 4586.42]  because he belonged to the house and the line of David. He went there to register with Mary,
[4586.56 --> 4593.62]  who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child. While they were there,
[4594.74 --> 4602.10]  the time came for the baby to be born. There's no urgency in that story. There's no emergency
[4602.10 --> 4608.72]  in that line, right? There's no innkeeper. There's no rush to accept this improvised place to stay
[4608.72 --> 4617.04]  because Jesus is already crowning. It's just not there. Instead, I want to suggest to you that Jesus,
[4619.04 --> 4627.92]  like every other boy or girl in that day, was born in a home surrounded by a community of women
[4627.92 --> 4632.30]  who cared for him and provided for Mary in her state of need.
[4635.24 --> 4640.90]  But what about the animals, you say? Right? There are animals present. Are there?
[4642.48 --> 4649.22]  I mean, the text says that she placed him in a manger, and yes, that word manger can mean a feeding
[4649.22 --> 4656.04]  crib or an animal stall. That's absolutely true, right? And a feeding crib or stall for larger animals,
[4656.04 --> 4661.00]  like donkeys or cows, if you manage to have one of those. But again, the story itself, the text itself
[4661.00 --> 4666.80]  doesn't say anything about those animals. But here, I have an image to show you.
[4667.92 --> 4677.20]  That in the design of a standard village home in Palestine, the stable is part of the main house.
[4678.14 --> 4679.52]  Can we get that first one on screen?
[4679.52 --> 4689.40]  So, what you see here on the top is a side cut, and then on the bottom is an overview. Now, the text
[4689.40 --> 4698.66]  might be hard to read for you, but I will explain it as we go. The main room was a family room where
[4698.66 --> 4705.24]  everyone lived and cooked, if that wasn't happening outside, and where everyone slept, right? These are
[4705.24 --> 4714.54]  one-room houses. And the end of the room, to your left here, has a door, and is usually lowered down
[4714.54 --> 4722.34]  by about three or four feet from the elevated floor of the main living area. That lowered area where the
[4722.34 --> 4731.00]  door is, is where the family's animals, at the end of the day, would come into the house. They would be
[4731.00 --> 4737.54]  brought in to the house at the end of the night, at the end of the day, sorry. And then the next
[4737.54 --> 4741.14]  morning, they would be ushered outside, and then the stalls would be swept and cleaned,
[4741.72 --> 4748.76]  and then they would do it again, right? And in that raised floor, where you see those few steps going
[4748.76 --> 4756.30]  up, in that raised floor, there would be mangers or feeding troughs for the animals to walk up to
[4756.30 --> 4762.64]  and just casually eat out of. Sometimes those troughs would be cut out of the stone in the floor.
[4762.80 --> 4769.84]  Sometimes they would be made of wood or some other material in order to hold that. But again,
[4770.34 --> 4776.00]  especially in winter, right, you want your animals brought into the house at night, the house where
[4776.00 --> 4784.10]  you live and sleep because of the heat that they give off, right? Because of what they naturally produce
[4784.10 --> 4790.00]  for all of its sense, keeps the house warm. And then look at the next image.
[4793.16 --> 4801.68]  This is the same idea, but now you have a guest room added on, or an inn, right? If a family
[4801.68 --> 4809.14]  was wealthy enough or a house was large enough and it had a guest room, the kataluma, right? It was
[4809.14 --> 4816.90]  either built on the end of it or as a second story on top. And so, because there was no room in the
[4816.90 --> 4823.00]  guest room, presumably because there was already people staying there, where did Mary and Joseph
[4823.00 --> 4833.26]  stay and give birth? In the main house with the rest of the family and likely a community of women
[4833.26 --> 4840.10]  women to help them and to encourage them. And I don't know about you, but regardless of what time
[4840.10 --> 4846.16]  of day it is, if you are that woman giving birth, you probably say, hey, for the next couple hours,
[4846.24 --> 4852.18]  do you mind if we just move the cows outside? So maybe there were no animals present. There's a possibility,
[4852.18 --> 4853.90]  but not a necessity.
[4857.62 --> 4867.78]  So, hearing this, you're now wondering, well, if this is all true, where do our stories come from?
[4869.00 --> 4873.62]  Why are the hallmarked versions of these stories so ubiquitous? Why are they everywhere present
[4873.62 --> 4881.90]  in our culture? And that is the right question to be asking. You can take that image off. If you're
[4881.90 --> 4885.70]  interested in those images, they come from Bailey's book. So, again, another plug for him.
[4887.48 --> 4894.60]  Around the year 200 AD, there is a little story written called, some of you have heard about this,
[4894.60 --> 4902.90]  the Gospel of Thomas. It's written by a Christian, but not a Jewish Christian. The author isn't familiar
[4902.90 --> 4908.92]  with Palestinian geography or with Jewish traditions or customs. This story has come to be called the
[4908.92 --> 4916.96]  Gospel of James, not because James, the brother of Jesus, wrote it, but because there's a tradition
[4916.96 --> 4922.24]  in these Gnostic Gospels to use the name of someone who is recognizable in order to give the story more
[4922.24 --> 4929.88]  credence in the culture around them. Part of the Gospel of James tells the story, retells the story of the
[4929.88 --> 4937.56]  birth of Jesus. And in that version of the story, Mary and Joseph arrive to Bethlehem late at night.
[4938.10 --> 4943.10]  And Mary tells Joseph, and hear this, she says, take me down from the donkey for the child within me
[4943.10 --> 4950.46]  presses on me to come forth. And so Joseph takes Mary down and he leaves her in a cave outside the
[4950.46 --> 4957.00]  city of Bethlehem and he rushes into the city to go get help. And then Joseph returns with a midwife,
[4957.00 --> 4964.58]  but in this Gospel of James story, Mary has already given birth to Jesus. And the story goes on into
[4964.58 --> 4972.20]  some pretty incredible stuff about Mary and angels and her perpetual virginity and little miracles that
[4972.20 --> 4981.58]  happen there. But interestingly, the Gospel of James is never accepted as true or as inspired or as
[4981.58 --> 4989.62]  anything more than a story. And as early as the fourth century, Pope Innocent I condemned it as a
[4989.62 --> 4998.30]  heresy, right? It is fully rejected by the Galatian decree in 500 AD. And yet, as Bailey concludes in his
[4998.30 --> 5005.68]  book, the average Christian who has never heard of this book is nonetheless unconsciously influenced by it.
[5005.68 --> 5011.92]  Now, not only this, because there has to be more than one reason why this persists.
[5013.12 --> 5018.22]  Again, in the second century, you have Justin Martyr, who is an early Christian church leader.
[5019.30 --> 5026.84]  He also says that Jesus was born in a cave outside of Bethlehem and that tradition is born. In the third
[5026.84 --> 5034.04]  century or fourth century, Saint Helena, who is the mother of Constantine I, if that means anything to
[5034.04 --> 5040.36]  you, she decides that there's going to build a church on this site of the cave that Justin Martyr
[5040.36 --> 5047.72]  identified. And then the Church of the Nativity is founded. And in its new form, the Church of the
[5047.72 --> 5053.20]  Nativity has existed on that spot up until today. If you go to Bethlehem now, you can visit the Church of
[5053.20 --> 5058.26]  the Nativity that is built on the site of this cave. The Church was destroyed in the 6th century,
[5058.36 --> 5068.56]  but then rebuilt, and it exists now in that space. Finally, by the 12th century, you have Saint Francis
[5068.56 --> 5074.60]  of Assisi, right? The name of the current Pope, the namesake of the current Pope. He's credited with
[5074.60 --> 5080.90]  creating the first nativity scene, right? With creating the first picture that's almost exactly the
[5080.90 --> 5093.00]  same as the one that you are familiar with today. And so over the course of history, this story was
[5093.00 --> 5102.60]  shaped and added to and tweaked and changed. But as I hope you have seen, when we look at the text,
[5103.34 --> 5109.12]  when we look at the archaeological evidence, it just isn't right. The truth of the story is that Jesus'
[5109.12 --> 5121.02]  birth is perfectly ordinary, and yet angels proclaim Him. His birth is perfectly ordinary, and yet for
[5121.02 --> 5128.96]  some reason, shepherds praise Him. His birth was the same as countless others who had come before Him
[5128.96 --> 5138.04]  and come after Him, and the whole town is amazed. That's the miracle of Christmas, right? He enters the
[5138.04 --> 5143.36]  perfectly ordinary in the same way in the same way as countless of kids before Him, and yet there is
[5143.36 --> 5153.66]  something extraordinary about Him, right? He is the extraordinary one, even if His story starts out just
[5153.66 --> 5154.48]  ordinary.
[5158.48 --> 5167.66]  God is in the mundane. He's in the everyday, right? God is available in the meanest worth,
[5167.66 --> 5173.42]  as we sing, as we sing, and He's also available in the just average, in the normal.
[5174.78 --> 5183.22]  It is the Christ child who is extraordinary. And so this year, don't miss Jesus for the hallmarked version
[5183.22 --> 5194.64]  of the story. History matters, because if this story is real, and I believe it is, right, then the other stories
[5194.64 --> 5203.68]  are real. And if the other stories in the gospel are true, then the tomb is empty. And if the tomb is empty,
[5203.68 --> 5214.42]  that changes everything. The tomb being empty changes Christmas. And that changes you.
[5214.42 --> 5222.58]  It's not the hallmarked version of the story that has power. It is the historical version of the story
[5222.58 --> 5233.20]  that changed the world. That is what we celebrate this Christmas. Amen? Amen. Let me pray with you.
[5233.20 --> 5262.40]  Come, thou long-expected Jesus. Come into the utterly ordinary. Come into the mundane of our lives.
[5263.20 --> 5275.76]  Come into the normal as extraordinary. Come into our lives and our world as the object of our affection,
[5276.20 --> 5285.60]  our attention, our worth and praise. Come into our lives today as you have come into the world in history.
[5285.60 --> 5291.20]  Come now in the spirit that we might know you, the real you, more.
[5293.20 --> 5299.52]  Fill us with your truth. Fill us with your truth. That no matter how we might feel today,
[5299.52 --> 5307.38]  we would rest on the firm foundation, the certitude of your gospel.
[5309.94 --> 5315.30]  We pray this, Jesus, in your holy, holy name. Amen.
[5323.20 --> 5346.20]  Lord, my soul is to this place.
[5346.20 --> 5353.20]  Truly my hope is in you.
[5353.20 --> 5359.92]  Lord of light, our only hope of glory.
[5359.92 --> 5366.72]  Your radiance shines in all who look to you.
[5366.72 --> 5373.68]  Come light the hearts of all in dark and shadow.
[5373.68 --> 5384.68]  You, O Lord, my soul in stillness waves.
[5384.68 --> 5390.68]  Truly my hope is in you.
[5390.68 --> 5398.68]  O spring of joy, rain down upon our spirits.
[5398.68 --> 5404.68]  Our thirsty hearts are yearning for your word.
[5404.68 --> 5408.68]  Come make us whole, come make us whole.
[5408.68 --> 5412.68]  Be comfort to our hearts.
[5415.68 --> 5422.68]  For you, O Lord, my soul in stillness waves.
[5422.68 --> 5429.68]  Truly my hope is in you.
[5429.68 --> 5436.68]  O root of life, we plant your seed within us.
[5436.68 --> 5442.68]  And in your advent, draw us all to you.
[5442.68 --> 5443.68]  Our hope, we plant your seed within us.
[5443.68 --> 5444.68]  Our hope, we plant your seed within us.
[5444.68 --> 5445.68]  Our hope, we plant your seed within us.
[5445.68 --> 5446.68]  We plant your seed within us.
[5446.68 --> 5449.68]  For you, O Lord, my soul in stillness waves.
[5449.68 --> 5450.68]  Truly my hope is in you.
[5450.68 --> 5462.68]  For you, O Lord, my soul in stillness waves.
[5462.68 --> 5467.68]  Truly my hope is in you.
[5467.68 --> 5474.68]  O key of knowledge, guide us in our pilgrimage.
[5474.68 --> 5480.68]  We ever seek, yet unfulfilled remain.
[5480.68 --> 5488.68]  Open to us the pathway of your peace.
[5488.68 --> 5500.68]  For you, O Lord, my soul in stillness waves.
[5500.68 --> 5507.68]  Truly my hope is in you.
[5507.68 --> 5526.68]  As you go this week, know that God himself, in the truth of his work and action in history, goes with you.
[5526.68 --> 5531.68]  Continue to work and act in your histories.
[5531.68 --> 5536.68]  God goes with you, and so receive his blessing.
[5536.68 --> 5539.68]  May God go before you, to lead you.
[5539.68 --> 5542.68]  May God go behind you, to guard you.
[5542.68 --> 5545.68]  May God go beneath you, to support you.
[5545.68 --> 5548.68]  And may God go beside you, to befriend you.
[5548.68 --> 5551.68]  Do not be afraid.
[5551.68 --> 5553.68]  Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[5553.68 --> 5560.68]  Do not be afraid, but go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
[5560.68 --> 5562.68]  Amen.
[5566.68 --> 5567.68]  Amen.
[5567.68 --> 5569.68]  .
[5569.68 --> 5578.68] 0
[5596.68 --> 5602.64]  Fill the skies with their wondrous song
[5602.64 --> 5609.56]  Awakening earth with news of his birth
[5609.56 --> 5616.90]  Join the hymn of the highest heaven song
[5616.90 --> 5622.44]  As the world fought the song of the angels
[5622.44 --> 5630.94]  Heavenly music is drowned by a warring world
[5630.94 --> 5637.80]  Yet hope burns a light that shatters the night
[5637.80 --> 5643.58]  Turn your heart to the call of glory
[5643.58 --> 5650.62]  Glory to God in the highest
[5650.62 --> 5657.12]  Peace to men on earth
[5657.12 --> 5664.12]  Come and adore him with wonder
[5664.12 --> 5671.12]  Christ, Lord of heaven and earth
[5671.12 --> 5676.62]  There is a day of creation
[5676.62 --> 5683.62]  As long for when all of time has been spent
[5683.62 --> 5687.62]  And the Lord returns
[5687.62 --> 5690.62]  His song will repeat
[5690.62 --> 5694.12]  As heaven completes
[5694.12 --> 5696.12]  Promise peace
[5696.12 --> 5700.62]  Peace that will fund the nations
[5700.62 --> 5707.12]  Glory to God in the highest
[5707.12 --> 5713.62]  Peace to men on earth
[5713.62 --> 5720.12]  Peace to men on earth
