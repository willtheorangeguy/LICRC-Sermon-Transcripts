[0.00 --> 5.00]  Then came the morning that sealed the promise
[5.00 --> 11.28]  Your buried body began to breathe
[11.28 --> 18.50]  Out of the silence the roaring lion
[18.50 --> 24.90]  Declared the grave has no claim on me
[24.90 --> 31.70]  Then came the morning that sealed the promise
[31.70 --> 38.40]  Your buried body began to breathe
[38.40 --> 45.16]  Out of the silence the roaring lion
[45.16 --> 51.72]  Declared the grave has no claim on me
[51.72 --> 57.52]  Jesus, yours is the victory
[57.52 --> 65.72]  Oh, hallelujah
[65.72 --> 69.50]  Praise the one who set me free
[69.50 --> 71.52]  Hallelujah
[71.52 --> 76.16]  Deadless ross, it's crippled me
[76.16 --> 79.58]  You have broken every chain
[79.58 --> 82.86]  This now may say your name
[82.86 --> 88.16]  Jesus Christ, my living hope
[88.16 --> 91.16]  Hallelujah
[91.16 --> 96.16]  Praise the one who set me free
[96.96 --> 98.16]  Hallelujah
[98.16 --> 102.16]  Death has lost, it's crippled me
[102.16 --> 105.58]  You have broken every chain
[105.58 --> 108.96]  This now may say your name
[108.96 --> 114.16]  Jesus Christ, my living hope
[114.16 --> 120.16]  Jesus Christ, my living hope
[120.16 --> 124.16]  Oh God, you are my living hope
[124.16 --> 128.16]  Oh God, you are my living hope
[129.16 --> 130.26]  Oh God, I focus on your life
[130.26 --> 133.12]  Oh God, you are my living hope
[133.12 --> 136.38]  Oh God, you are my living hope
[136.38 --> 138.44]  Oh Yeap, you are my living hope
[138.44 --> 142.68]  Oh God, you are my living hope
[142.68 --> 143.38]  Oh God, you are your living hope
[143.38 --> 145.96]  Oh God, you are your living hope
[145.96 --> 148.04]  Oh God, you are my living hope
[148.04 --> 170.72]  There is no fear, cause I believe There is no doubt, cause I have seen
[170.72 --> 179.22]  Your faithfulness, my fortress, over and over
[179.22 --> 187.68]  I have a hope, found in Your name
[187.68 --> 193.08]  I have a strength, found in Your grace
[193.08 --> 201.58]  Your faithfulness, my fortress, over and over
[201.58 --> 209.78]  Make way through the water, walk me through the fire
[209.78 --> 215.66]  Do what you are famous for, what you are famous for
[215.66 --> 220.88]  Shut the mouths of lions, bring dry wounds to life
[220.88 --> 227.02]  Do what you are famous for, what you are famous for
[227.02 --> 231.82]  I believe in You
[231.82 --> 237.60]  God, I believe in You
[237.60 --> 243.64]  Release Your love inside of me

[405.44 --> 418.00]  Every breath it is a gift, every moment is a treasure
[418.00 --> 430.80]  All my past and my regrets, my present and my future
[435.44 --> 443.68]  Every table is a feast, every heartbeat is an altar
[443.68 --> 456.42]  Every step a mystery, I'm walking with the author
[456.42 --> 468.08]  So I fix my eyes upon you, I fix my eyes upon you
[468.08 --> 480.46]  So I fix my eyes upon you, I fix my eyes
[480.46 --> 485.20]  Oh praise, oh praise
[485.20 --> 493.18]  Heaven bent to meet us, Father, Son and Spirit
[493.18 --> 497.46]  Oh praise, oh praise
[497.98 --> 507.46]  God and men together, one with us forevermore
[507.46 --> 520.90]  In famine we will eat, in drought we'll see a downpour
[520.90 --> 525.58]  Yes we will
[525.58 --> 533.46]  So let all our fighting cease, the Prince our peace has conquered
[533.46 --> 545.34]  So I fix my eyes upon you, I fix my eyes upon you
[545.34 --> 554.12]  I fix my eyes upon you, I fix my eyes
[554.12 --> 558.82]  Oh praise, oh praise
[558.82 --> 566.78]  Heaven bent to meet us, Father, Son and Spirit
[566.78 --> 571.64]  Oh praise, oh praise

[581.12 --> 582.86]  Oh forevermore
[582.86 --> 586.78]  Oh forevermore
[586.78 --> 588.78]  Forevermore
[588.78 --> 596.36]  Why should my heart go in me?
[596.78 --> 599.94]  Don't be so downcast on my soul
[599.94 --> 602.74]  You are in every moment
[602.74 --> 606.00]  You are my greatest miracle
[606.00 --> 609.66]  Why should my heart go weary?
[609.66 --> 612.66]  Don't be so downcast on my soul
[612.66 --> 615.66]  You are in every moment
[615.66 --> 618.66]  You are my greatest miracle
[618.66 --> 621.74]  Why should my heart go weary?
[621.74 --> 625.50]  Don't be so downcast on my soul
[625.50 --> 628.24]  You are in every moment
[628.24 --> 631.58]  You are my greatest miracle
[631.58 --> 635.24]  Why should my heart go weary?
[635.24 --> 637.24]  Don't be so downcast on my soul
[637.24 --> 641.64]  Good morning church and welcome to worship this morning
[641.64 --> 645.18]  It is great that we are able to gather together through technology
[645.18 --> 648.72]  as the body of Christ and worship here today
[648.72 --> 651.50]  For those of you who do not know me, my name is Kevin
[651.50 --> 652.76]  I'm the youth pastor here
[652.76 --> 658.28]  and it is a joy to be here on this beautiful, sunny, it seems like a summer day
[658.28 --> 660.24]  even though we're just sort of in the middle of April
[660.24 --> 662.54]  You may be wondering where Pastor Chris is
[662.54 --> 663.96]  He's hanging out with his family today
[663.96 --> 665.12]  We'll hear more about that later
[665.12 --> 666.28]  So you're stuck with me today
[666.28 --> 669.00]  I'm not going to apologize because that's great, isn't it?
[669.66 --> 672.00]  All right, I've got a couple of announcements before we begin
[672.00 --> 675.92]  The first is that we are still looking for a few elders and deacons
[675.92 --> 677.98]  to help serve on our church leadership body
[677.98 --> 681.30]  The nomination process has been out for the last couple weeks
[681.30 --> 683.90]  but that is coming to an end today and tomorrow
[683.90 --> 686.46]  So if you have been approached by someone
[686.46 --> 689.60]  If you think that you might make a good elder
[689.60 --> 691.14]  that you've got the gifts to be a deacon
[691.14 --> 694.56]  Please follow sort of the rules or the process
[694.56 --> 696.72]  I mean that's in the bulletin and the midweek memo
[696.72 --> 697.94]  Chat with your elder
[697.94 --> 698.64]  Call myself
[698.64 --> 699.56]  Call Pastor Chris
[699.56 --> 700.42]  Call the church office
[700.42 --> 702.24]  And we are looking for more
[702.24 --> 704.92]  So if that is an area that you think you can serve
[704.92 --> 707.44]  or an area that someone else has put on your heart to consider
[707.44 --> 708.16]  Please pray
[708.16 --> 709.18]  Please discern
[709.18 --> 712.12]  And please let us know in the next day or two about that
[712.12 --> 715.36]  I think we'll hear a little bit more about that later on in the service
[715.36 --> 719.22]  Second of all today we are going to be doing a Zoom coffee after church
[719.22 --> 720.98]  It would be great to see you all
[720.98 --> 723.96]  So if you can sign on to that at about 11.30 today
[723.96 --> 725.86]  We'll just hang out for a little bit
[725.86 --> 727.60]  See about life, how things are going
[727.60 --> 729.24]  And enjoy each other's company
[729.24 --> 731.90]  Grab your coffee, your tea, I don't know, your pie
[731.90 --> 734.24]  Whatever it is you need and sign on at 11.30 today
[734.24 --> 736.78]  The link is in the bulletin that came out yesterday
[736.78 --> 737.88]  or the midweek memo as well
[737.88 --> 744.04]  And finally, we've been seeing online the pictures of those who have been tagged
[744.04 --> 747.08]  For our game, the treat tag that's happening right now
[747.08 --> 750.66]  It is something that is building community amongst ourselves here
[750.66 --> 753.32]  But also you can spread that beyond the church too
[753.32 --> 756.98]  Feel free to go around, drop off a treat at someone's door
[756.98 --> 760.28]  Leave the little treat tag note and take a picture of it
[760.28 --> 762.44]  And if you've been getting them, remember
[762.44 --> 765.28]  If you get tagged, you're it
[765.28 --> 768.04]  So make sure to go tag one to five others as well
[768.04 --> 771.20]  So we look forward to that game continuing as well
[771.20 --> 774.18]  Now, before we begin in worship
[774.18 --> 776.42]  Please receive God's greeting this morning
[776.42 --> 779.20]  Which comes from Revelation chapter 1
[779.20 --> 782.04]  Grace to you and peace
[782.04 --> 785.90]  From him who is and who was and who is to come
[785.90 --> 789.40]  And from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness
[789.40 --> 791.46]  The firstborn of the dead
[791.46 --> 794.34]  And the ruler of the kings of the earth
[794.34 --> 796.06]  God's people say
[796.06 --> 797.34]  Amen
[797.34 --> 798.84]  Let's worship together this morning
[798.84 --> 803.42]  Good morning and welcome to worship
[803.42 --> 806.78]  God speaks to us today through Psalm 66
[806.78 --> 810.54]  Shout for joy to God, all the earth
[810.54 --> 812.12]  Sing the glory of his name
[812.12 --> 814.98]  Give him glorious praise
[814.98 --> 817.40]  Say to God, how awesome are your deeds
[817.40 --> 821.16]  So great is your power that your enemies come cringing to you
[821.16 --> 824.80]  All the earth worships you and sings praises to you
[824.80 --> 826.82]  They sing praises to your name
[826.82 --> 831.82]  We declare your majesty
[831.82 --> 852.94]  We declare your majesty
[852.94 --> 859.94]  We proclaim that your name is exalted
[859.94 --> 862.94]  We proclaim that your name is exalted
[862.94 --> 867.94]  For you reign magnificently rule
[867.94 --> 868.94]  Our God is mighty
[868.94 --> 869.94]  Our God is mighty
[869.94 --> 872.94]  Our God is mighty
[872.94 --> 874.94]  Lift up your name
[874.94 --> 877.94]  For you are holy
[877.94 --> 878.94]  Sing it again
[878.94 --> 882.94]  All honor and glory
[882.94 --> 889.94]  In adoration we bow before your throne
[889.94 --> 897.94]  We declare your majesty
[897.94 --> 898.94]  We bow before your throne
[898.94 --> 904.94]  We declare your majesty
[904.94 --> 910.94]  We proclaim that your name is exalted
[910.94 --> 913.94]  We proclaim that your name is exalted
[913.94 --> 917.94]  For you reign magnificently rule
[917.94 --> 919.94]  We proclaim that your name is exalted
[919.94 --> 920.94]  We proclaim that your name is exalted
[920.94 --> 921.94]  We proclaim that your name is exalted
[921.94 --> 923.94]  We proclaim that your name is exalted
[923.94 --> 924.94]  You reign magnificently rule
[924.94 --> 925.94]  We proclaim that your name is exalted
[925.94 --> 926.94]  We proclaim that your name is exalted
[926.94 --> 927.94]  In Christ will proclaim the word in the water
[927.94 --> 929.94]  So we'll grant you all that your name is exalted
[929.94 --> 930.94]  blessings
[930.94 --> 931.94]  We glorious Christ from righteousness
[931.94 --> 949.94]  You CORPSON
[949.94 --> 954.46]  We bow before your throne.
[960.74 --> 963.60]  Join me in our prayer of confession and assurance.
[967.36 --> 972.74]  Dear God, we declare your majesty.
[973.94 --> 977.16]  It's hard to deny when we walk into the glorious sunshine
[977.16 --> 979.66]  and hear the singing of the morning birds
[979.66 --> 982.20]  and try to capture the beauty of spring flowers.
[983.32 --> 986.34]  Your nature, your power, your beauty, your love
[986.34 --> 990.36]  is on display for us to proclaim and be captured by in wonder.
[992.04 --> 994.40]  And yet, we still forget.
[995.58 --> 998.32]  We still bicker and harbor anger against one another.
[999.12 --> 1002.88]  We still choose our sinful nature over Christian love.
[1003.88 --> 1006.42]  We still turn away from your design, God.
[1008.04 --> 1010.50]  We are so sorry.
[1011.88 --> 1015.14]  And when we aren't, remind us.
[1015.66 --> 1016.84]  Draw us to you.
[1018.34 --> 1021.88]  Remind us that it is only by grace that we can enter.
[1023.30 --> 1025.36]  We thank you, God, for your mercy.
[1027.78 --> 1028.88]  Remind us.
[1030.00 --> 1030.88]  In your name we pray.
[1031.38 --> 1031.68]  Amen.
[1031.68 --> 1031.80]  Amen.
[1037.16 --> 1058.40]  Only by grace can we enter.
[1058.40 --> 1063.40]  Only by grace can we stand.
[1063.40 --> 1068.58]  Not by our human endeavor.
[1069.58 --> 1074.16]  But by the blood of the Lamb.
[1074.16 --> 1075.46]  Into your presence you trust.
[1075.46 --> 1077.78]  Into your presence you trust.
[1079.44 --> 1083.40]  You trust you come.
[1084.72 --> 1088.72]  Into your presence you trust.
[1088.72 --> 1093.80]  And now by your grace we come.
[1094.76 --> 1099.08]  And now by your grace we come.
[1099.08 --> 1108.64]  Lord, if you mock our transgressions, who would stand?
[1111.36 --> 1118.12]  Thanks to your grace, we are cleansed by the blood of the Lamb.
[1120.60 --> 1126.36]  Lord, if you mock our transgressions, who would stand?
[1129.08 --> 1136.66]  Thanks to your grace, we are cleansed by the blood of the Lamb.
[1139.42 --> 1143.38]  Only by grace can we enter.
[1144.66 --> 1147.68]  Only by grace can we stand.
[1148.68 --> 1157.68]  Not by our human endeavor, but by the blood of the Lamb.
[1157.68 --> 1162.68]  Into your presence you call us.
[1163.50 --> 1166.68]  You call us to come.
[1168.54 --> 1171.68]  Into your presence you draw us.
[1173.48 --> 1175.68]  And now by your grace we come.
[1178.02 --> 1181.68]  And now by your grace we come.
[1181.68 --> 1194.58]  Good morning.
[1195.64 --> 1197.42]  Welcome to Kids' Corner, everybody.
[1197.68 --> 1202.66]  My name is Mr. Mike, and I have the privilege of sharing a story and a little bit of a lesson with you today.
[1202.66 --> 1211.70]  But, first, we've been working on a memory work this month, as we have been every month, kind of through the spring and part of the fall.
[1212.12 --> 1219.38]  And this month, our memory work comes from, well, we're going to let Nora DeWinter help us out with that.
[1219.38 --> 1222.12]  So here's Nora to walk us through the memory work this month.
[1222.12 --> 1238.08]  For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal life.
[1238.70 --> 1240.00]  John 3.16.
[1240.00 --> 1244.36]  Thank you, Nora.
[1244.50 --> 1245.12]  Nice work.
[1245.26 --> 1247.62]  I hope everybody's getting that verse really well.
[1248.84 --> 1252.06]  So, we are in kind of a celebration of Easter.
[1252.18 --> 1260.44]  Easter was a couple weeks ago, and we're still celebrating Jesus and his message on earth and working towards his ascension to heaven.
[1261.16 --> 1267.40]  So this week, before we get into the story, we're going to play a little game I used to call, Do You Doubt It?
[1267.40 --> 1268.28]  Okay?
[1268.52 --> 1274.66]  So we're going to work through a few little facts or quiz kind of questions.
[1275.20 --> 1286.08]  And you guys at home, make sure you come close to the camera or to the TV screen, sorry, so you can see the statement that you guys have to decide, Do You Doubt It?
[1286.38 --> 1287.74]  Or could it be true?
[1288.44 --> 1288.76]  Okay?
[1289.34 --> 1292.60]  So my kids, so a special thank you to Gracie, Riz, and Liv.
[1292.64 --> 1294.68]  They came up with all these cool factoids.
[1295.06 --> 1296.26]  And you guys are going to help me out.
[1296.26 --> 1296.62]  All right?
[1296.70 --> 1297.66]  So here's the first one.
[1297.80 --> 1299.16]  And I have not seen these.
[1299.42 --> 1301.56]  So I don't know if they're true or false.
[1301.80 --> 1302.06]  Okay?
[1302.72 --> 1303.66]  Here's the first one.
[1305.22 --> 1314.18]  Naomi, you might remember, Ruth's mother-in-law from the Bible, and her family left Bethlehem to Moab because of a famine.
[1315.64 --> 1316.74]  Do you doubt it?
[1317.52 --> 1319.44]  I don't know.
[1319.52 --> 1320.76]  I don't really remember the story very well.
[1320.80 --> 1321.36]  What do you think?
[1321.80 --> 1322.54]  Do you doubt it?
[1322.54 --> 1323.32]  Or is that true?
[1323.32 --> 1324.24]  Let's see.
[1325.06 --> 1325.50]  True.
[1326.32 --> 1326.68]  Okay.
[1327.28 --> 1333.12]  This, Moab, is where her sons met their wives, Ruth and Oprah.
[1333.54 --> 1333.92]  Okay.
[1334.26 --> 1336.40]  So maybe a little easy one to start off with.
[1336.88 --> 1337.40]  Next one.
[1337.86 --> 1338.66]  Do you doubt this?
[1338.66 --> 1343.60]  The Canucks have won the Stanley Cup three times.
[1344.38 --> 1346.54]  I doubt that.
[1346.66 --> 1348.00]  I heavily, heavily doubt that.
[1348.06 --> 1349.70]  I'm a bit of an Oilers fan myself.
[1350.28 --> 1351.06]  There's not a chance.
[1351.82 --> 1352.56]  What do you guys think?
[1352.72 --> 1353.60]  Do you doubt it?
[1353.90 --> 1354.82]  Or is it true?
[1355.66 --> 1356.08]  Let's see.
[1357.08 --> 1357.50]  Nope.
[1357.50 --> 1359.60]  I doubt it.
[1359.60 --> 1359.70]  I doubt it.
[1359.74 --> 1360.46]  And that was right.
[1360.80 --> 1364.22]  They've made it to the finals three times, but have never won.
[1364.76 --> 1364.90]  Yeah.
[1365.22 --> 1365.42]  Yeah.
[1365.50 --> 1365.86]  Tricky.
[1366.58 --> 1368.94]  Some of your parents might be turning off the TV pretty soon.
[1369.64 --> 1370.14]  Keeps up.
[1370.58 --> 1371.58]  Here's the next one.
[1373.42 --> 1379.06]  High heels fashion originated, it started, with men.
[1379.80 --> 1382.28]  With boys and high heels?
[1382.28 --> 1385.36]  I doubt that.
[1386.08 --> 1389.90]  I think I've never worn them, and there's not a chance I could walk in them.
[1390.00 --> 1391.10]  For sure, it started with ladies.
[1391.24 --> 1391.86]  What do you think?
[1392.48 --> 1393.16]  You doubt it?
[1393.86 --> 1394.64]  You think it's true?
[1396.02 --> 1396.50]  True.
[1398.42 --> 1402.26]  Soldiers wore them to make riding horses easier.
[1403.88 --> 1407.80]  I should check my kids' where they got this.
[1407.80 --> 1411.88]  The heel went around the stirrup into the little, where you put your foot.
[1412.28 --> 1412.72]  Wow.
[1412.92 --> 1413.82]  That's fascinating.
[1414.78 --> 1415.16]  Okay.
[1415.26 --> 1416.04]  Here's the next one.
[1417.06 --> 1417.80]  Are you keeping track?
[1417.88 --> 1418.80]  I'm not keeping points.
[1419.00 --> 1419.82]  It's okay if you don't.
[1420.66 --> 1422.14]  Some of you are probably doing better than me.
[1423.38 --> 1423.98]  Next up.
[1424.96 --> 1430.58]  Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were thrown into the lion's den and lived.
[1431.56 --> 1431.82]  Wow.
[1431.92 --> 1432.04]  Yeah.
[1432.12 --> 1433.98]  I mean, we've all heard that story, right?
[1434.04 --> 1435.58]  That's like a common story.
[1435.68 --> 1436.20]  I know it.
[1436.24 --> 1436.78]  You know it.
[1436.78 --> 1437.28]  It's true.
[1437.40 --> 1437.76]  It's for sure.
[1437.86 --> 1438.00]  It's true.
[1439.76 --> 1440.16]  Nope.
[1440.16 --> 1442.36]  Did you guys know?
[1442.56 --> 1443.24]  Did I get it wrong?
[1444.18 --> 1448.44]  They were thrown into a fiery furnace for not worshiping the king.
[1448.60 --> 1450.18]  Who was thrown into the lion's den?
[1450.64 --> 1451.28]  You guys remember?
[1452.28 --> 1452.74]  Daniel.
[1452.98 --> 1453.18]  Yeah.
[1453.36 --> 1453.84]  Daniel.
[1454.10 --> 1454.28]  Ugh.
[1454.60 --> 1454.94]  Tricky.
[1455.40 --> 1455.74]  Tricky.
[1457.22 --> 1457.92]  Next one.
[1458.10 --> 1459.02]  Do you doubt this?
[1460.42 --> 1463.64]  The human brain is mostly made of water.
[1463.64 --> 1466.46]  Give your head a shake.
[1466.60 --> 1468.92]  I don't really hear any sloshing.
[1470.36 --> 1470.94]  I doubt it.
[1471.90 --> 1472.14]  Nope.
[1472.60 --> 1472.84]  Nope.
[1472.92 --> 1474.10]  I got brains in my brains.
[1474.20 --> 1475.32]  I don't got water in my brain.
[1477.24 --> 1477.64]  Nope.
[1477.78 --> 1478.62]  I am wrong again.
[1479.18 --> 1481.02]  Mostly, it's made of fat.
[1481.20 --> 1481.34]  Oh.
[1481.84 --> 1484.30]  So, it wasn't made of brains, but it wasn't made of water either.
[1485.36 --> 1485.96]  Do you know how...
[1485.96 --> 1487.52]  Here's a little extra factoid.
[1487.60 --> 1488.94]  Do you know how heavy your brain is?
[1489.58 --> 1492.10]  The average brain weighs 11 pounds.
[1493.60 --> 1496.54]  I don't know if mine weighs that much, but...
[1496.54 --> 1497.60]  Here we go.
[1497.74 --> 1498.30]  Next one.
[1499.44 --> 1500.24]  Do you doubt this?
[1501.16 --> 1505.32]  A camel has two eyelids.
[1505.62 --> 1506.76]  I think for each eye.
[1507.12 --> 1507.88]  Two eyelids.
[1509.60 --> 1511.02]  That sounds kind of weird.
[1511.92 --> 1512.56]  I doubt it.
[1512.80 --> 1513.50]  What do you think?
[1514.30 --> 1515.02]  You doubt it?
[1515.14 --> 1515.96]  Or do you think it's true?
[1517.28 --> 1518.36]  They live in the desert.
[1518.94 --> 1520.36]  You know, they're crazy.
[1521.04 --> 1521.40]  Nope.
[1521.60 --> 1521.72]  Oh.
[1522.26 --> 1524.24]  They have three eyelids.
[1524.52 --> 1526.12]  That is crazy.
[1526.66 --> 1527.62]  I didn't know that.
[1528.54 --> 1529.88]  I'm going to have to look that up later.
[1530.04 --> 1531.36]  Get to see what the picture of that is.
[1531.74 --> 1532.28]  Next one.
[1533.24 --> 1534.06]  Do you doubt this?
[1535.88 --> 1538.44]  There are 55 books in the Bible.
[1539.58 --> 1540.34]  Is that true?
[1540.56 --> 1541.18]  Or false?
[1541.28 --> 1541.74]  What do you think?
[1541.76 --> 1543.86]  How many books in the Bible are there?
[1543.90 --> 1544.46]  Do you know them all?
[1544.46 --> 1545.18]  Genesis, Exodus.
[1545.64 --> 1545.88]  Wow.
[1547.34 --> 1547.62]  Nope.
[1547.62 --> 1548.92]  How many are there?
[1549.66 --> 1550.76]  There are 66.
[1551.78 --> 1556.60]  39 in the Old Testament and 27 in the New Testament.
[1557.16 --> 1557.74]  So 66.
[1558.00 --> 1559.12]  Oh, that was another tricky one.
[1560.52 --> 1561.48]  Last one.
[1562.20 --> 1563.10]  Do you doubt this?
[1563.10 --> 1568.08]  Some cats are allergic to humans.
[1569.60 --> 1570.98]  That seems backwards.
[1571.14 --> 1574.56]  Like, I know lots of people that, humans, that are allergic to cats.
[1575.84 --> 1576.96]  Do you doubt that?
[1577.22 --> 1578.08]  Or is that true?
[1579.70 --> 1580.52]  It's true.
[1582.10 --> 1584.06]  But I've never heard one sneeze.
[1584.60 --> 1585.50]  Or have I?
[1585.90 --> 1586.18]  Ooh.
[1586.44 --> 1586.64]  Ooh.
[1586.64 --> 1588.78]  Tricky question from my family.
[1589.12 --> 1591.46]  Thanks, family, for these great factoids.
[1591.46 --> 1593.10]  Did you guys get a lot of those?
[1593.22 --> 1595.32]  Did you doubt some of those crazy facts?
[1595.74 --> 1599.32]  There's some crazy stuff in the world and some really cool stuff in the Bible.
[1600.00 --> 1603.78]  I bet you today you could come up with some of your own cool facts and maybe throw them
[1603.78 --> 1605.90]  up on our social media or message us to them.
[1606.36 --> 1607.46]  We can always play a game with them.
[1607.94 --> 1612.84]  But we're going to read a story kind of about that, about a person who doubted some of the
[1612.84 --> 1615.06]  crazy, awesome stuff that God did.
[1615.06 --> 1622.00]  And a big one, of course, that happened at Easter was Jesus rose from the dead and defeated
[1622.00 --> 1623.34]  death for all of us.
[1624.00 --> 1626.26]  So here's a story of someone who kind of doubted that.
[1627.96 --> 1631.14]  It's called Doubting Thomas from the book of John 20.
[1631.14 --> 1637.18]  Now Thomas had not yet seen Jesus and he doubted.
[1637.78 --> 1641.82]  I need to touch the nail holes in his hand, he said.
[1642.08 --> 1647.26]  I need to see the place in his side where the soldiers stuck him with his spear before
[1647.26 --> 1648.72]  I will believe he's alive.
[1649.92 --> 1653.20]  The disciples were meeting in a room with the door shut tight.
[1654.10 --> 1658.42]  Suddenly, Jesus showed up right in the middle of them all.
[1658.42 --> 1660.16]  It was a miracle.
[1661.42 --> 1663.42]  Jesus hallowed his hands and showed his scars.
[1664.12 --> 1666.68]  Touch the places where the nails went in.
[1667.28 --> 1671.84]  Thomas, feel the spot on my side where the spear pierced me.
[1672.92 --> 1674.58]  Finally, Thomas believed.
[1675.66 --> 1677.68]  You are Jesus, he said.
[1678.06 --> 1679.76]  My Lord and my God.
[1681.06 --> 1683.02]  Thomas, you have seen me and believed.
[1683.02 --> 1690.20]  Blessed are those people who haven't seen me and still believe anyway, Jesus said.
[1692.44 --> 1693.64]  What a cool story.
[1693.86 --> 1698.10]  And that was pretty cool that Jesus appeared to Thomas and showed himself to him.
[1698.46 --> 1699.00]  Because you know what?
[1699.08 --> 1703.52]  Thomas, his friends, all the other disciples, some of them had already seen Jesus, right?
[1703.90 --> 1704.88]  Or had heard from him.
[1705.04 --> 1708.96]  And they told Thomas that story and Thomas said, no, you know, I got to see this to believe
[1708.96 --> 1709.06]  it.
[1709.10 --> 1709.56]  I don't know.
[1709.56 --> 1710.16]  You know?
[1710.84 --> 1712.52]  And I think a lot of us have that.
[1712.64 --> 1716.58]  I think maybe some of us know people in our family or friends that are like, I don't know.
[1716.66 --> 1717.66]  I don't see God.
[1717.78 --> 1719.36]  I don't think he's real.
[1719.40 --> 1721.40]  I don't think Jesus is around anymore.
[1722.02 --> 1723.08]  But is that true?
[1723.80 --> 1725.12]  We sometimes doubt that.
[1725.76 --> 1729.92]  What are some ways you see Jesus or God in your life every day?
[1730.24 --> 1731.54]  I was reminded the other day.
[1731.60 --> 1732.46]  We went for a hike.
[1732.96 --> 1734.36]  And we were on the mountaintop.
[1734.36 --> 1739.54]  And we looked over the creation, you know, the trees and the blue lake and the blue sky.
[1739.64 --> 1741.62]  And even walking in the path, all the green.
[1741.74 --> 1743.86]  I was like, this is amazing.
[1744.38 --> 1745.96]  There's no way that just happens.
[1746.10 --> 1747.90]  There's got to be a God.
[1748.38 --> 1750.70]  And then this week, what happened in our church?
[1750.86 --> 1752.22]  We had two babies born.
[1752.32 --> 1754.18]  We'll hear maybe more about that in the congregational prayer.
[1754.50 --> 1755.38]  Two babies born.
[1755.44 --> 1757.18]  A year ago, they weren't even people.
[1757.98 --> 1760.96]  And now we have whole new people added to our church family.
[1760.96 --> 1763.64]  That's amazing, you know?
[1764.44 --> 1766.34]  So what are some ways that you see God?
[1766.92 --> 1769.28]  What are the ways you see Jesus working in your life?
[1769.58 --> 1775.78]  What are some ways maybe your friends have experienced Jesus or heard of Jesus' love?
[1776.14 --> 1778.36]  Maybe you and your families can talk about that this week.
[1778.44 --> 1779.72]  Maybe ask your mom and dad.
[1780.08 --> 1782.54]  How have you seen Jesus, mom and dad?
[1782.68 --> 1783.62]  Or grandma and grandpa?
[1783.84 --> 1784.66]  Or your aunt and uncle?
[1784.76 --> 1787.98]  How have you seen Jesus in their lives?
[1787.98 --> 1792.78]  And they might have some pretty cool stories to tell, much like the disciples had when Jesus came back.
[1794.22 --> 1795.84]  Well, let's close this in prayer.
[1796.48 --> 1797.50]  And I hope you have a great day.
[1797.64 --> 1798.08]  Let's pray.
[1800.30 --> 1808.54]  Heavenly Father, we thank you so much that you defeated death and have made yourself real to this world in so many ways.
[1808.62 --> 1816.54]  Whether appearing to the disciples or showing up in our lives in amazing little ways in creation, in stories, in miracles.
[1816.54 --> 1820.10]  And we just pray that we would have eyes open to see those things.
[1820.54 --> 1828.36]  We also pray for your encouragement to share those stories and to tell our friends around us that you are real in our lives.
[1829.12 --> 1829.80]  In your name we pray.
[1830.14 --> 1830.38]  Amen.
[1831.60 --> 1831.98]  All right.
[1832.14 --> 1833.24]  We'll see you guys next week.
[1833.36 --> 1834.00]  Have a good Sunday.
[1834.00 --> 1863.98]  Have a good Sunday.
[1864.00 --> 1893.98]  Have a good Sunday.
[1894.00 --> 1923.98]  Have a good Sunday.
[1923.98 --> 1925.98]  Have a good Sunday.
[1925.98 --> 1953.96]  Have a good Sunday.
[1953.96 --> 1954.96]  Have a good Sunday.
[1955.10 --> 1955.96]  Have a good Sunday.
[1955.96 --> 1957.82]  Have a good Sunday.
[1957.96 --> 1959.96]  Have a good Sunday.
[1960.10 --> 1960.96]  The Wednesday night.
[1960.96 --> 1966.74]  Pharmacular and have a good Sunday offering life.
[1966.74 --> 1970.74]  shaping communities, and supporting students.
[1970.74 --> 1974.74]  They currently work in 11 countries in Central America,
[1974.74 --> 1980.74]  the Caribbean, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia.
[1980.74 --> 1986.74]  Without your prayers or financial gifts, this work would not be able to happen.
[1986.74 --> 1991.74]  And that is why it is their mission to show you the tangible difference
[1991.74 --> 1997.74]  that you are making for the teachers, the schools, and the students.
[1997.74 --> 2001.74]  From Proverbs 3, the first couple of verses, we read these words,
[2001.74 --> 2007.74]  My son, do not forget my teaching, but keep my commands in your heart,
[2007.74 --> 2014.74]  for they will prolong your life many years and bring you prosperity.
[2014.74 --> 2018.74]  Next week's offering is for GEMS.
[2018.74 --> 2026.74]  GEMS is a church ministry for girls that are in grades 3 through 7.
[2026.74 --> 2031.74]  Please refer to the midweek memo or the church's e-bulletin
[2031.74 --> 2035.74]  on the many ways to give for today's offering.
[2035.74 --> 2040.74]  Take time in prayer and consider where you can help out today.
[2040.74 --> 2042.74]  Thank you.
[2042.74 --> 2052.74]  We will now go into our congregational prayer, and I want to just mention a few things before we do.
[2052.74 --> 2059.74]  We are again to be blessed as a church to celebrate new life.
[2059.74 --> 2068.74]  And we want to celebrate with Brandon and Savannah, Dan and Rebecca,
[2068.74 --> 2074.74]  and also still with Dan and Ismay also, who had a, all three of these families have had baby girls,
[2074.74 --> 2077.74]  and to that we celebrate with them.
[2077.74 --> 2082.74]  And also there are still those expecting in the coming months as well,
[2082.74 --> 2088.74]  some fairly soon and some further along, and we want to remember them also.
[2088.74 --> 2096.74]  As we remember life, we also need to remember those who have had loved ones pass on,
[2096.74 --> 2103.74]  and who the Lord has taken away from us here, and that we need to be with them also in prayer.
[2103.74 --> 2111.74]  And I'm going to go out on a limb here, and we also, as we celebrate life, we need to celebrate birthdays.
[2111.74 --> 2117.74]  These are wonderful ways that God has blessed us to be able to celebrate what he has given to us.
[2117.74 --> 2120.74]  And today, it is Pastor Chris' birthday.
[2120.74 --> 2124.74]  I'm going to go out on a limb here and take full authority for what I'm saying,
[2124.74 --> 2128.74]  and if this is wrong, I'll take the heat.
[2128.74 --> 2134.74]  But Pastor Chris, to you we want to say happy birthday, and may the Lord be with you today.
[2134.74 --> 2136.74]  Shall we go in prayer?
[2136.74 --> 2148.74]  Heavenly Father, we come before your throne on this wonderful, beautiful, sunny day.
[2148.74 --> 2150.74]  Lord, we thank you for life.
[2150.74 --> 2157.74]  We thank you for each day that you give to us, and today too, may we see your goodness.
[2157.74 --> 2161.74]  And Lord, it seems easier when the days are sunny and warm,
[2161.74 --> 2170.74]  and yet still we know that even on those cold, rainy days, there too you are with us, and that you bless us then also.
[2170.74 --> 2176.74]  Lord, may we see the gifts that you give to us each day again, and may we be thankful for them.
[2176.74 --> 2178.74]  And Lord, may we thank you.
[2178.74 --> 2181.74]  Lord, you bless us richly.
[2181.74 --> 2186.74]  And Lord, as you bless us, may we too bless those around us.
[2186.74 --> 2200.74]  Lord, today we are offering for Ed Judeo, and Lord, we pray that this worldwide ministry supporting Christian education throughout the world,
[2200.74 --> 2203.74]  Lord, may they too be blessed by our gifts.
[2203.74 --> 2212.74]  Lord, we pray also for our local schools also, both the Christian schools and also the public schools also, Lord.
[2212.74 --> 2219.74]  Wherever you have placed students and teachers, Lord, may they each one, Lord, know that you lead them in their lives.
[2219.74 --> 2227.74]  Lord, we thank you for a new life that you have blessed to our church family here.
[2227.74 --> 2229.74]  Lord, we pray for Bren and Savannah.
[2229.74 --> 2231.74]  We pray for Dan and Rebecca.
[2231.74 --> 2237.74]  For Dan and Ismay, Lord, each family has been blessed with little baby girls.
[2237.74 --> 2240.74]  And Lord, we thank you.
[2240.74 --> 2243.74]  We pray, Lord, that each one may grow healthy.
[2243.74 --> 2250.74]  That each one, Lord, in their own simple ways may come to know you and grow close to you as they grow up.
[2250.74 --> 2260.74]  Lord, we pray for the parents too, that you would bless them with gifts that they too need to grow their children in you.
[2260.74 --> 2271.74]  Lord, we pray for health for each one, and we pray also, Lord, for those who grieve still.
[2271.74 --> 2273.74]  Lord, we pray for Juanita.
[2273.74 --> 2276.74]  We pray for Dolores.
[2276.74 --> 2279.74]  Lord, we pray for Janet.
[2279.74 --> 2292.74]  Lord, we pray for Dick and Emily and their family, Lord, as Emily lost her mother also now some time ago.
[2292.74 --> 2300.74]  And still, Lord, there are others of us, Lord, who have lost perhaps loved ones years ago.
[2300.74 --> 2304.74]  Still, Lord, we mourn.
[2304.74 --> 2313.74]  And Lord, each day we come to you for strength, for comfort.
[2313.74 --> 2325.74]  We pray, Lord, that as a church family too, we may surround each other and bless each other with the gifts, Lord, that you have given to us.
[2325.74 --> 2338.74]  Lord, we know also that even today there are those in our church family here also who still hurt and who have health issues, Lord, that we may not know about.
[2338.74 --> 2343.74]  Lord, we pray for each one, that they may experience your healing touch.
[2343.74 --> 2350.74]  That they may know, Lord, that still you watch over each one.
[2350.74 --> 2355.74]  And Lord, there are also those who are struggling with COVID.
[2355.74 --> 2360.74]  And Lord, we pray for the Elkhema family.
[2360.74 --> 2372.74]  Lord, as various members have been tested positive, Lord, through this challenging time of isolation, Lord, be with them.
[2372.74 --> 2375.74]  We pray that you would provide them with healing.
[2375.74 --> 2384.74]  You would provide others, Lord, in our church perhaps also who are dealing with the same issues that they too may experience your healing touch also.
[2384.74 --> 2390.74]  Lord, there are also a number who are shut in.
[2390.74 --> 2395.74]  Lord, we pray for Judy and Diane.
[2395.74 --> 2400.74]  Lord, we pray for Miriam and for Frank.
[2400.74 --> 2405.74]  May they too continue to experience healing from surgeries that they have gone through.
[2405.74 --> 2417.74]  And yet, Lord, there are other families still who are dealing with broken relationships.
[2417.74 --> 2418.74]  You know each one by name.
[2418.74 --> 2420.74]  You know the struggles, Lord.
[2420.74 --> 2421.74]  We pray for healing.
[2421.74 --> 2426.74]  We pray for strength and comfort for each of those families also.
[2426.74 --> 2433.74]  And Lord, even though we may not know them by name, may we hold them up to you, Lord.
[2433.74 --> 2442.74]  And Lord, we pray for our church's leadership also.
[2442.74 --> 2454.74]  That, Lord, as we travel, as we lead this church family, Lord, through these challenging times, may we know, Lord, that you are with us.
[2454.74 --> 2456.74]  May we seek you for wisdom.
[2456.74 --> 2463.74]  May we, as we as a church, may we be a shining light in this community.
[2463.74 --> 2477.74]  And Lord, we so often think of what do we pray for and how do we bring this forward to you.
[2477.74 --> 2479.74]  And Lord, even simple things.
[2479.74 --> 2486.74]  Lord, we, as this past week, we have gone through this treat tag.
[2486.74 --> 2492.74]  As simple as that may seem, Lord, we pray that that too may bring community together here.
[2492.74 --> 2497.74]  And that as a church family, we may be able to share gifts with each other as you have blessed us.
[2497.74 --> 2500.74]  And that it may connect us closer as a family.
[2500.74 --> 2505.74]  Lord, we thank you for these opportunities.
[2505.74 --> 2511.74]  Lord, we thank you also for those who are able to lead and worship each week again.
[2511.74 --> 2518.74]  And today also, Lord, there is a group here that is leading in word and in song.
[2518.74 --> 2523.74]  Lord, we pray for Kevin as he brings your word to us today.
[2523.74 --> 2526.74]  Give him the words to speak, Lord, that we may hear them.
[2526.74 --> 2531.74]  Lord, we pray that each one may grow closer to you.
[2531.74 --> 2534.74]  We pray these things, Lord, in your name.
[2534.74 --> 2535.74]  Amen.
[2543.74 --> 2544.74]  Good morning again.
[2544.74 --> 2547.74]  It's a pleasure to be with you this morning.
[2547.74 --> 2551.74]  As Elder John just said, can I call you Elder John?
[2552.74 --> 2554.74]  I'm just, I'm going to call him Elder John.
[2554.74 --> 2556.74]  I think that's just going to be his new name now.
[2556.74 --> 2559.74]  As Elder John has already told us, it is Pastor Chris's birthday today,
[2559.74 --> 2561.74]  which is one of the reasons I'm here.
[2561.74 --> 2565.74]  But it's also a reason why I'm going to do something a little different right now.
[2565.74 --> 2571.74]  Instead of sort of my usual introductory story or some sort of playful banter like I sometimes do,
[2571.74 --> 2582.74]  I'm going to give you all 73 seconds starting now to pull out your phones and to send Pastor Chris a text, a DM, an email.
[2582.74 --> 2587.74]  I want to flood his phones with congratulations and happy birthdays right now.
[2587.74 --> 2593.74]  And while you're doing that, I'm going to take the next 57 seconds, your time has already started, I hope you're doing this already,
[2593.74 --> 2596.74]  to tell you some of my favorite birthday jokes.
[2596.74 --> 2599.74]  And so keep doing that, keep sending the messages, this is good.
[2599.74 --> 2602.74]  But while you do that, have an ear open to listen to these beauties.
[2602.74 --> 2605.74]  What did the teddy bear say on his birthday?
[2605.74 --> 2609.74]  No cake for me, please, I'm stuffed.
[2609.74 --> 2613.74]  That's good. Linda liked that one in the back.
[2613.74 --> 2618.74]  Number two, why do we put candles on top of birthday cakes?
[2618.74 --> 2621.74]  Because it's too hard to put them on the bottom.
[2621.74 --> 2623.74]  I know, they're just a good one.
[2623.74 --> 2625.74]  And finally, number three here.
[2625.74 --> 2627.74]  Oh, Mike liked that one, that's good.
[2627.74 --> 2632.74]  Number three here, what did the pirate say on his 80th birthday?
[2632.74 --> 2635.74]  I'm 80.
[2635.74 --> 2638.74]  That's good, a few laughs and it starts here.
[2638.74 --> 2640.74]  Those are my favorites, I hope that's good.
[2640.74 --> 2643.74]  You now have five seconds to finish up those texts and messages
[2643.74 --> 2646.74]  and then we're gonna forget about Chris for the next 20 minutes.
[2646.74 --> 2649.74]  So two, one, time's up, there it goes.
[2649.74 --> 2651.74]  All right, Chris, I hope your phone broke.
[2651.74 --> 2655.74]  Everybody else, put your phones away or pull them out.
[2655.74 --> 2658.74]  And you can follow along for our text this morning.
[2658.74 --> 2663.74]  Before we do that though, speaking of birthdays, did you know that I get the same thing for my birthday every year?
[2663.74 --> 2665.74]  It's sort of turned into like this fun tradition.
[2665.74 --> 2668.74]  So every year, I get a year older.
[2668.74 --> 2671.74]  One more joke in there, finish off strong.
[2671.74 --> 2677.74]  All right, today we're gonna look at our text, James 4, verses 1 to 12.
[2677.74 --> 2681.74]  And so pull out your Bibles, pull out your phones if that's what you read your Bible on,
[2681.74 --> 2685.74]  snuggle up with your tea, whatever you need, and follow along in James 4, verses 1 to 12.
[2685.74 --> 2688.74]  And as we read it, I want you to notice a bit of a tone shift.
[2688.74 --> 2693.74]  We've been working through this sermon series on James, and this is a passage that really shifts tones.
[2693.74 --> 2698.74]  And so pull out your Bibles and see if you can spot that today and read along with me.
[2698.74 --> 2702.74]  So, James 4, 1 to 12, it says this.
[2702.74 --> 2706.74]  What causes fights and quarrels amongst you?
[2706.74 --> 2709.74]  Don't they come from your desires that battle within you?
[2709.74 --> 2713.74]  You desire, but you do not have, so you kill.
[2713.74 --> 2719.74]  You covet, but you cannot get what you want, and so you quarrel and fight.
[2719.74 --> 2722.74]  You do not have because you do not ask God.
[2722.74 --> 2726.74]  And when you do ask, you do not receive, because you ask with the wrong motives,
[2726.74 --> 2731.74]  that you may spend what you get on your pleasures.
[2731.74 --> 2737.74]  You adulterous people, don't you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God?
[2737.74 --> 2744.74]  Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.
[2744.74 --> 2752.74]  Or do you think that Scripture says, without reason, that he jealously longs for the spirit he has caused to dwell in us?
[2752.74 --> 2754.74]  But he gives us more grace.
[2754.74 --> 2761.74]  That is why Scripture says, God opposes the proud, but shows favor to the humble.
[2761.74 --> 2763.74]  Submit yourselves then to God.
[2763.74 --> 2766.74]  Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
[2766.74 --> 2769.74]  Come near to God, and he will come near to you.
[2769.74 --> 2771.74]  Wash your hands, you sinners.
[2771.74 --> 2775.74]  Purify your hearts, you double-minded.
[2775.74 --> 2778.74]  Grieve, mourn, and wail.
[2778.74 --> 2785.74]  Change your laughter into mourning, and your joy into gloom.
[2785.74 --> 2790.74]  Humble yourself before the Lord, and he will lift you up.
[2790.74 --> 2793.74]  Brothers and sisters, do not slander one another.
[2793.74 --> 2797.74]  Anyone who speaks against a brother or a sister, or judges them,
[2797.74 --> 2800.74]  speaks against the law and judges it.
[2800.74 --> 2808.74]  When you judge the law, you are not keeping it, but sitting in judgment on it.
[2808.74 --> 2814.74]  There is only one lawgiver and judge, the one who is able to save and destroy.
[2814.74 --> 2818.74]  But you, who are you to judge your neighbor?
[2818.74 --> 2821.74]  The word of the Lord.
[2821.74 --> 2827.74]  Now, before we dig too deeply into this passage, it's important to remember sort of where we are coming from.
[2827.74 --> 2832.74]  Last week, Pastor Christ, he helped us look at two different types of wisdom.
[2832.74 --> 2837.74]  On the one hand, we have earthly wisdom, which brings on disorder in our hearts.
[2837.74 --> 2846.74]  But the second type of wisdom is heavenly wisdom, which, as James 3 teaches us, allows us to become peacemakers in this world.
[2846.74 --> 2850.74]  And the final verse of chapter 3, before the text we read today, says,
[2850.74 --> 2858.74]  peacemakers whom heavenly wisdom brings, peacemakers who sow in peace, reap a harvest of righteousness.
[2858.74 --> 2864.74]  And then we get our text today, and you can kind of see the tone shift start right off the bat.
[2864.74 --> 2870.74]  We jump from peacemaking into what causes quarrels and fights amongst you.
[2870.74 --> 2873.74]  That's the question that leads off our text today.
[2873.74 --> 2876.74]  James doesn't miss a beat when answering his own question, though.
[2876.74 --> 2881.74]  And he says right away that it is our desires that do.
[2881.74 --> 2886.74]  The selfish desires of our heart.
[2886.74 --> 2890.74]  Now, desires, James uses the Greek word.
[2890.74 --> 2894.74]  And before I say this Greek word, let's all remember that I'm a seminary student.
[2894.74 --> 2896.74]  I haven't taken my Greek yet.
[2896.74 --> 2901.74]  And I learned how to pronounce this word on YouTube, which sort of makes me question my higher education altogether.
[2901.74 --> 2909.74]  But James uses this Greek word hedone, which is where we get our word hedonism from.
[2909.74 --> 2917.74]  Now, for those of you who don't know, hedonism is this philosophy that makes the goal of our lives pleasure.
[2917.74 --> 2923.74]  It's the philosophy that pleasure is the most important thing to pursue.
[2923.74 --> 2935.74]  And so James is looking at these Christians that he's writing to and he's saying, you kill and you covet figuratively and perhaps even literally for the things you desire, for the pleasures that you want.
[2935.74 --> 2943.74]  And even in prayer, even in prayer, you do not pray for God's will, but you pray selfishly.
[2943.74 --> 2947.74]  You pray, my will be done and my name be great.
[2947.74 --> 2951.74]  James is very assertive here.
[2951.74 --> 2961.74]  For example, you'll notice that after these first three verses, he transitions with verse four and he uses this line as an introductory to that.
[2961.74 --> 2966.74]  He looks, he looks, starts verse four off with you adulterous people.
[2966.74 --> 2975.74]  Now, throughout this whole letter, all the way through these first three chapters, every time he addresses his readers, he uses the language brothers and sisters.
[2975.74 --> 2977.74]  Not here.
[2977.74 --> 2978.74]  Not here.
[2978.74 --> 2980.74]  Change is here.
[2980.74 --> 2985.74]  He transitions by saying, you adulterous people.
[2985.74 --> 2989.74]  This shift matters.
[2989.74 --> 2991.74]  It matters a lot.
[2991.74 --> 2993.74]  This is not brothers and sisters.
[2993.74 --> 2995.74]  This is you adulterous people.
[2995.74 --> 2998.74]  This needs to grab our attention.
[2998.74 --> 3004.74]  If you're listening right now, if you're watching, and you believe in God the Father almighty,
[3004.74 --> 3013.74]  if you believe in God the Father almighty, the creator of heaven and earth, and you believe in his only begotten son who was born of the Virgin Mary,
[3013.74 --> 3022.74]  who lived a perfect life, who was crucified, who died, who was buried, and on the third day he rose again from the dead, defeating sin and death forever.
[3022.74 --> 3029.74]  If you believe that, then you are the bride of Christ.
[3029.74 --> 3030.74]  The church.
[3030.74 --> 3031.74]  The church.
[3031.74 --> 3036.74]  The church is the bride of Christ.
[3036.74 --> 3038.74]  That means you're committed to Christ.
[3038.74 --> 3040.74]  You've committed to him.
[3040.74 --> 3047.74]  Honestly, you've committed to Christ even more so than you've committed to your spouse, if you are in fact married.
[3047.74 --> 3053.74]  Because the commitment you made to your spouse is until death do us part.
[3053.74 --> 3058.74]  But this commitment to Christ, that's a commitment to forever.
[3058.74 --> 3062.74]  For all of glorious eternity in heaven.
[3065.74 --> 3070.74]  Now in marriage, if you cheat on your spouse and commit adultery, your marriage will suffer.
[3070.74 --> 3074.74]  And that will also likely end.
[3074.74 --> 3077.74]  What happens if we cheat on our Savior?
[3077.74 --> 3081.74]  What happens if we commit adultery against our Lord?
[3083.74 --> 3086.74]  Verse 4, you adulterous people.
[3086.74 --> 3088.74]  That's the question we're going to look at today.
[3088.74 --> 3092.74]  How are we as Christ followers adulterous?
[3092.74 --> 3094.74]  And what can we do about that?
[3094.74 --> 3104.74]  Again, James 4 says, you adulterous people, don't you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God?
[3104.74 --> 3109.74]  Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.
[3111.74 --> 3115.74]  James is saying we commit adultery by becoming friends with the world.
[3115.74 --> 3116.74]  But what does that mean?
[3116.74 --> 3123.74]  Well, like verses 1 through 3, friendship with the world comes down to the sinful desires of the heart.
[3123.74 --> 3128.74]  It comes from seeking pleasure from the world as a means of fulfillment.
[3128.74 --> 3130.74]  In a nutshell, this is a nice little quote.
[3130.74 --> 3137.74]  In a nutshell, friendship to the world is the sinful desires of our hearts,
[3137.74 --> 3143.74]  which are motivated, and this is important, by a longing for earthly pleasure.
[3143.74 --> 3158.74]  Our culture, this is so, so applicable to our lives here.
[3158.74 --> 3161.74]  Our culture pushes pleasure so much.
[3161.74 --> 3163.74]  Our culture pushes us to want pleasure.
[3163.74 --> 3166.74]  Our culture pushes us to receive pleasure.
[3166.74 --> 3168.74]  It is a pleasure-driven society.
[3168.74 --> 3175.74]  We see it in the media we consume, in what TV shows or movies we watch, the music we listen to.
[3175.74 --> 3177.74]  You see it in any advertisement you watch.
[3177.74 --> 3179.74]  They're created for us.
[3179.74 --> 3185.74]  We see it in how sex is portrayed in our world, the lifestyles that we're pushed to consume.
[3185.74 --> 3187.74]  It's all pleasure-based.
[3187.74 --> 3189.74]  We want pleasure.
[3189.74 --> 3190.74]  We all do.
[3190.74 --> 3192.74]  We want the newest phones.
[3192.74 --> 3199.74]  We want the nicer cars, the fancy living room, the nice outside patio area, the big pension plan.
[3199.74 --> 3205.74]  We want these things because we're told it will bring us comfort, and we're told it will bring us pleasure.
[3205.74 --> 3212.74]  Life will be easier if only you had... fill in the blank.
[3212.74 --> 3222.74]  And if we're honest with ourselves, I mean if we're truly, truly honest, not only do we want pleasure,
[3222.74 --> 3229.74]  but we'll find ourselves prioritizing our own comforts, our own pleasures, ahead of other people's needs.
[3229.74 --> 3237.74]  And I don't just mean the poor, the homeless, the orphan, the widow, but I don't want to minimize them either,
[3237.74 --> 3241.74]  because Jesus speaks of them over and over again in his ministry.
[3241.74 --> 3250.74]  Now, while that's likely true, we often prioritize our own needs, sorry, our own wants, our own pleasures,
[3250.74 --> 3253.74]  over the needs of simply the other.
[3253.74 --> 3260.74]  During this pandemic, it's become so easy for us to forget about the other.
[3260.74 --> 3265.74]  Your brother or your sister in Christ who you don't see on Sunday anymore.
[3265.74 --> 3270.74]  That co-worker of yours that only works from home now, you haven't seen them in a year.
[3270.74 --> 3276.74]  That friend you have who just happens to be in a different school cohort than you are in.
[3276.74 --> 3283.74]  Are we worried about our own desires, our own pleasures over them?
[3283.74 --> 3287.74]  Well, what kind of pleasures, you might be asking?
[3287.74 --> 3292.74]  In her book, Glittering Vices, the author Rebecca Conondyke de Young,
[3292.74 --> 3298.74]  she focuses on the seven deadly sins and what they actually look like now in the 21st century.
[3298.74 --> 3303.74]  Now, all of these sins, all of these sins, they're desires of the flesh.
[3303.74 --> 3308.74]  They're pleasures that we seek, provide us with fulfillment in this life.
[3308.74 --> 3313.74]  They are vices that cause us to commit adultery against our Savior.
[3313.74 --> 3315.74]  Take, for example, vanity.
[3315.74 --> 3320.74]  How much time do we spend in our lives comparing ourselves to others?
[3320.74 --> 3325.74]  How much time do we spend on our own looks, our own clothes, our own selfies,
[3325.74 --> 3333.74]  to make sure that others see us as important or having purpose or of value or just beautiful?
[3333.74 --> 3338.74]  What kind of likes or shares or comments do we chase on social media
[3338.74 --> 3342.74]  in order to feel this sense of pleasure in our lives?
[3342.74 --> 3345.74]  Or greed.
[3345.74 --> 3348.74]  We often mask greed with independence.
[3348.74 --> 3350.74]  We'll call it independence often.
[3350.74 --> 3353.74]  We can be guilty of thinking we do not need God because we've got it covered.
[3353.74 --> 3355.74]  We look at our life and we say,
[3355.74 --> 3361.74]  it's my job, my car, my house, my yard, my food, my dog, my savings.
[3361.74 --> 3364.74]  And we forget that it all belongs to God.
[3364.74 --> 3369.74]  It's not just the needing more that's greed.
[3369.74 --> 3375.74]  It's the feeling that I've obtained what I have by me doing my work myself.
[3375.74 --> 3378.74]  Me, me, me.
[3378.74 --> 3382.74]  That is what greed looks like.
[3382.74 --> 3385.74]  Or we use food to fulfill our selfish desires.
[3385.74 --> 3386.74]  Gluttony.
[3386.74 --> 3387.74]  We're too stressed.
[3387.74 --> 3388.74]  We eat too much.
[3388.74 --> 3391.74]  We overindulge because we've worked really hard and we deserve this.
[3391.74 --> 3396.74]  Or on the flip side, we don't eat because we want to consume people's compliments for how we look.
[3396.74 --> 3401.74]  We desire the pleasure of our own looks, of our own body, and so we starve ourselves.
[3401.74 --> 3403.74]  It's also gluttony.
[3403.74 --> 3406.74]  The same side, or the different side of the same coin.
[3406.74 --> 3409.74]  But it's not just food that we overindulge in.
[3409.74 --> 3417.74]  It's other things like Netflix or Instagram or fantasy sports or whatever else fills the boredom gaps in our lives and brings us pleasure.
[3417.74 --> 3418.74]  Lust.
[3418.74 --> 3427.74]  We desire control or attention or pleasure, and so many have turned to pornography to fulfill that desire.
[3427.74 --> 3430.74]  But it's more than sex we lust after.
[3430.74 --> 3431.74]  It's power.
[3431.74 --> 3432.74]  It's position.
[3432.74 --> 3434.74]  It's prominence in this world.
[3434.74 --> 3439.74]  It's rising the social ladder so that others may view us as better than maybe even we are.
[3439.74 --> 3442.74]  Lust is inward focus.
[3442.74 --> 3446.74]  Lust is pleasure-driven.
[3446.74 --> 3447.74]  Wrath.
[3447.74 --> 3448.74]  Wrath.
[3448.74 --> 3451.74]  De Young, she writes, I love this quote so much.
[3451.74 --> 3453.74]  De Young writes about wrath.
[3453.74 --> 3461.74]  She writes, being angry is like drinking rat poison and waiting for that rat to die.
[3461.74 --> 3462.74]  I think that is awesome.
[3462.74 --> 3467.74]  Anger tears us up inside and solves nothing.
[3467.74 --> 3474.74]  And yet anger brings us pleasure because when we're angry, we aren't the problem.
[3474.74 --> 3478.74]  The other person is, and that makes us feel all right.
[3478.74 --> 3479.74]  Envy.
[3479.74 --> 3483.74]  It's wanting what other people have, but more than that, it's placing your own desires first.
[3483.74 --> 3488.74]  It's making sure you're better than the others and placing your own wants and needs above a person.
[3488.74 --> 3491.74]  Envy is the pursuit of pleasure.
[3491.74 --> 3494.74]  It's the opposite of love.
[3494.74 --> 3496.74]  And finally, sloth.
[3496.74 --> 3498.74]  Sloth is not simply laziness.
[3498.74 --> 3499.74]  Sloth.
[3499.74 --> 3504.74]  Being slothful is willfully deciding not to do something of value.
[3504.74 --> 3506.74]  Not to do something of value.
[3506.74 --> 3509.74]  That means we can spend all day, we can be super busy.
[3509.74 --> 3511.74]  We can spend all day doing meaningless tasks for ourselves.
[3511.74 --> 3516.74]  We can fill our candles, our calendars up with selfish ambitions and still be slothful
[3516.74 --> 3523.74]  because we've only thought of ourselves and our own selfish desires.
[3523.74 --> 3524.74]  The downer right now.
[3524.74 --> 3526.74]  We're going to get to the good news, I promise.
[3526.74 --> 3528.74]  But David Platt sums this up so nicely.
[3528.74 --> 3529.74]  He says this.
[3529.74 --> 3530.74]  He says,
[3530.74 --> 3536.74]  In our culture and churches, we have sought after the pleasures of this world in sexuality,
[3536.74 --> 3538.74]  impurity and debauchery.
[3538.74 --> 3543.74]  We have satisfied our flesh with the things of this world more than possess, with more possessions,
[3543.74 --> 3546.74]  nicer car, bigger houses and better luxuries.
[3546.74 --> 3550.74]  We've pursued positions, praises and popularity.
[3550.74 --> 3556.74]  And his point is that we've lived for what is best for us in this world.
[3556.74 --> 3563.74]  By doing so, we've cheated on the very God whom we've declared to be faithful to.
[3563.74 --> 3565.74]  That's the question for us today.
[3565.74 --> 3567.74]  How are we cheating on God?
[3567.74 --> 3570.74]  That's a question for us each to ponder.
[3570.74 --> 3576.74]  But, here's the good transition.
[3576.74 --> 3578.74]  The Bible is awesome.
[3578.74 --> 3584.74]  Because while we are all no doubt guilty of pursuing selfish pleasures,
[3584.74 --> 3589.74]  James, he offers us a solution, which is just really nice of James.
[3589.74 --> 3594.74]  The cure to hedonism is humbling yourself.
[3594.74 --> 3599.74]  If you read verses 6 through 10 of our text, you hear James call us into action.
[3599.74 --> 3600.74]  He says,
[3600.74 --> 3602.74]  Submit yourselves to God.
[3602.74 --> 3604.74]  Resist the devil.
[3604.74 --> 3605.74]  Go near to God.
[3605.74 --> 3609.74]  Wash your hands and purify your hearts of sin.
[3609.74 --> 3614.74]  Humble yourself before God.
[3614.74 --> 3616.74]  James quotes Proverbs 3, 34.
[3616.74 --> 3622.74]  God opposes the proud, but shows grace to the humble.
[3622.74 --> 3626.74]  Jesus says something very similar in Matthew 23, 12.
[3626.74 --> 3630.74]  And Peter even reiterates the same thing in 1 Peter 5, verse 5.
[3630.74 --> 3638.74]  God opposes the proud, but shows grace to the humble.
[3638.74 --> 3640.74]  First, God opposes the proud.
[3640.74 --> 3644.74]  Well, he does so because in part, being proud is resistance.
[3644.74 --> 3649.74]  The proud resist the truths of God because they believe they understand better.
[3649.74 --> 3653.74]  The proud resist the laws of God because they have their own motivations.
[3653.74 --> 3661.74]  The proud resist the gifts of God because they have obtained all things that they possess.
[3661.74 --> 3664.74]  It's no wonder God resists the proud.
[3664.74 --> 3668.74]  What God desires is humility.
[3668.74 --> 3673.74]  God gives grace to the humble.
[3673.74 --> 3678.74]  To humble ourselves before God means we need to recognize the desires of the flesh.
[3678.74 --> 3682.74]  We need to acknowledge that sin is easily entangling us.
[3682.74 --> 3684.74]  We need to confess.
[3684.74 --> 3690.74]  That's why James says you must change your laughter into mourning and your joy into gloom.
[3690.74 --> 3693.74]  That's a weird line.
[3693.74 --> 3697.74]  Now, he doesn't say this because life is only serious and there's no room for joy.
[3697.74 --> 3701.74]  He says this in the context of this passage, in the context of sin,
[3701.74 --> 3705.74]  or in the context of us desiring earthly pleasures.
[3705.74 --> 3710.74]  As Douglas Moo points out, James' insistence that we turn our joy into gloom,
[3710.74 --> 3716.74]  it might sound strange in light of Paul's injunction to rejoice in the Lord always.
[3716.74 --> 3724.74]  But the joy Paul speaks of is the joy that comes when we realize that our sins are forgiven in Christ.
[3724.74 --> 3733.74]  The joy James warns us about is the fleeting and superficial joy that comes when we indulge in sin.
[3733.74 --> 3737.74]  We should not praise the sin that we commit.
[3737.74 --> 3742.74]  We should not bluff off the things that we desire.
[3742.74 --> 3747.74]  We must humbly turn to Christ with our sins, not rejoicing over them,
[3747.74 --> 3751.74]  but with mourning in our hearts for the wrongs we have done.
[3751.74 --> 3752.74]  We aren't to minimize.
[3752.74 --> 3754.74]  We aren't to forget.
[3754.74 --> 3757.74]  We're to bow.
[3757.74 --> 3762.74]  And when we do that, by the power of Christ, we are forgiven.
[3762.74 --> 3766.74]  Christ, who was born into this world to redeem it.
[3766.74 --> 3769.74]  And though he was tempted in this world like you and like I,
[3769.74 --> 3775.74]  the desires of the flesh from the devil, they did not cause him to stumble.
[3775.74 --> 3780.74]  He walked into the city of God where he was arrested for crimes he did not commit.
[3780.74 --> 3786.74]  And he suffered pain that he did not deserve.
[3786.74 --> 3792.74]  He died a cruel death on the cross that was meant for you and was meant for me.
[3792.74 --> 3798.74]  And then three days later, he rose again from the grave, defeating sin and death.
[3798.74 --> 3802.74]  And he atoned for the sins that we commit each and every day.
[3802.74 --> 3807.74]  And he did all of this in humility.
[3807.74 --> 3815.74]  He humbly took all of that sin that you and I commit, all of the sins of the world.
[3815.74 --> 3818.74]  And in his humility, he bore it.
[3818.74 --> 3821.74]  And he suffered under the weight of it.
[3821.74 --> 3824.74]  And he died with all of it.
[3824.74 --> 3828.74]  And then he rose to defeat it.
[3828.74 --> 3837.74]  Christ's humility in taking on our sin is how he defeated it.
[3837.74 --> 3845.74]  And that is the reason we can humbly bring the desires of our heart to Christ.
[3845.74 --> 3848.74]  In Christ's humility, he defeated sin.
[3848.74 --> 3856.74]  And in our humility, we can keep bringing it to him because his grace is enough.
[3856.74 --> 3858.74]  In fact, it's more than enough.
[3858.74 --> 3863.74]  No matter what you're carrying today, know that he has mercy and grace in abundance for you.
[3863.74 --> 3871.74]  No matter what we forfeit, when we pursue selfish pleasures, we can never forfeit our salvation.
[3871.74 --> 3876.74]  For there is always more grace.
[3876.74 --> 3881.74]  We just need to be humble and bring it to Christ.
[3881.74 --> 3884.74]  What does humility look like?
[3884.74 --> 3888.74]  C.S. Lewis defines humility in this way.
[3888.74 --> 3891.74]  He says, humility is not thinking less of yourself.
[3891.74 --> 3894.74]  Thinking of yourself less.
[3894.74 --> 3901.74]  We don't think less of ourselves by being humble.
[3901.74 --> 3906.74]  Because we can be confident in who we are in Christ.
[3906.74 --> 3909.74]  Humility is not thinking less of ourselves.
[3909.74 --> 3913.74]  We can be confident in ourselves and our salvation in Christ.
[3913.74 --> 3915.74]  It's not thinking less of ourselves.
[3915.74 --> 3919.74]  It's thinking of ourselves less.
[3921.74 --> 3924.74]  It's thinking of the other.
[3924.74 --> 3926.74]  And that's full circle, church.
[3926.74 --> 3929.74]  God calls us to humility.
[3929.74 --> 3934.74]  To move away from seeking the earthly pleasures that our flesh draws us to.
[3934.74 --> 3937.74]  And to think of ourselves less.
[3937.74 --> 3939.74]  Think of God more.
[3939.74 --> 3941.74]  Think of the other more.
[3941.74 --> 3947.74]  Then we can start to live the lives that resemble what Christ is looking for in his bride.
[3947.74 --> 3951.74]  Not a checklist of do's and don'ts.
[3951.74 --> 3954.74]  But a life lived for others.
[3954.74 --> 3957.74]  A life lived for God.
[3958.74 --> 3961.74]  A life thinking of ourselves less.
[3963.74 --> 3969.74]  When we do that, we become a witness to God's humble and powerful grace and salvation to the entire world.
[3969.74 --> 3979.74]  When we strive to stop chasing our own pleasures, our own desires, and we start thinking of ourselves less, we will start to think of God and others more.
[3980.74 --> 3983.74]  And thus bear witness to God's kingdom here on earth.
[3983.74 --> 3987.74]  I want to conclude with this.
[3987.74 --> 3992.74]  Our text ties a nice bow on things with verses 11 and 12.
[3992.74 --> 3999.74]  Now the first half of our text we looked at today, it emphatically highlighted the root cause of our adultery with God.
[3999.74 --> 4004.74]  And the second half of our text showed God's calling us to humility.
[4004.74 --> 4013.74]  And this third and final half of our text, and I checked the math and it holds out, it directs us to James' grand point all along throughout his entire book.
[4015.74 --> 4025.74]  James 4, 11 to 12 says, and I'm summarizing here, that we are not to slander against anyone, for if we speak poorly of others, we judge them and the law.
[4025.74 --> 4027.74]  If we judge the law, we do not keep the law.
[4027.74 --> 4032.74]  And therefore, we both minimize the law and become judged by it.
[4032.74 --> 4034.74]  A lot of words.
[4034.74 --> 4036.74]  What James is saying here once again is this.
[4036.74 --> 4041.74]  He's highlighting that we need to be more than simply hearers of the word.
[4041.74 --> 4043.74]  We need to be doers.
[4043.74 --> 4049.74]  If we go out and speak poorly of someone, if we gossip behind someone's back, we tear them down.
[4049.74 --> 4060.74]  If someone is doing wrong and we take that wrong they are doing and slander them to others, we're just as guilty as the one who did wrong.
[4061.74 --> 4063.74]  Then we are hearers but not doers.
[4063.74 --> 4071.74]  However strong our view of God's law might be, it's a failure if we don't actually do it.
[4071.74 --> 4077.74]  And it shows the world that we, in fact, do not put any weight behind that law.
[4077.74 --> 4086.74]  So by speaking poorly of a neighbor or a brother or a sister or anyone, we judge that person to a certain standard.
[4086.74 --> 4090.74]  By slandering them, we fall below that standard that we're holding them to.
[4090.74 --> 4093.74]  Love does not beget slander.
[4093.74 --> 4096.74]  Knowing the law does not mean we get to ignore it.
[4096.74 --> 4106.74]  Once again, we see James' understanding of Christianity as something whose reality is defined by testing by the measure of obedience.
[4106.74 --> 4111.74]  We must be hearers and viewers.
[4111.74 --> 4120.74]  And so, as we conclude now, ask yourself and ask your small groups or your care groups or your family or someone you love these questions this week.
[4120.74 --> 4129.74]  What pleasures do I seek which cause me to be adulterous, my Lord?
[4129.74 --> 4135.74]  When have I slandered someone's name and how can I make that right?
[4135.74 --> 4139.74]  Finally, how can I humbly come before God?
[4139.74 --> 4142.74]  Think of others this week.
[4142.74 --> 4144.74]  Let's be encouraged by the words of verse 10 of our text.
[4144.74 --> 4148.74]  It is not us who have to work hard to make sure we're lifted up.
[4148.74 --> 4154.74]  As Christians, we don't need to subscribe to the mantra of our culture which says, look out for number one.
[4154.74 --> 4167.74]  We can trust that if we humbly go before our God and we trust in him and we live lives thinking less of ourselves and more of others, we will be exalted by God.
[4167.74 --> 4169.74]  We do the obeying.
[4169.74 --> 4171.74]  He does the lifting.
[4171.74 --> 4174.74]  Let's pray.
[4174.74 --> 4185.74]  Lord, our Father in heaven, we are grateful for this challenge, this conviction in this text.
[4185.74 --> 4195.74]  Lord, in this world there are so many pleasures that we are drawn to, so many things that pull us towards them, so many things that we want because we think that will make our life better.
[4199.74 --> 4201.74]  God, stir in our hearts.
[4201.74 --> 4209.74]  Stir in our hearts to teach us what those things are and give us the strength, give us the power, give us the courage to say no.
[4209.74 --> 4216.74]  And not just say no, but God, give us the humility to come before you and lay them at your feet.
[4216.74 --> 4218.74]  For Lord, we know your grace is enough.
[4218.74 --> 4221.74]  Your mercy is more than we could ever imagine.
[4221.74 --> 4227.74]  May we be humble enough to bring those to you to confess what it is that our hearts are longing for.
[4227.74 --> 4234.74]  And may we think of ourselves less and focus on you and on others more.
[4234.74 --> 4246.74]  As we go about our days, our weeks, the rest of this year, the rest of our lives, we pray that that becomes a rhythm for all of us.
[4246.74 --> 4263.74]  So, we are grateful for your son, for his death and resurrection, for his life on this earth, for his humility in taking on the sins of this world.
[4263.74 --> 4269.74]  May that give us the strength and humility to bring our sins to you.
[4270.74 --> 4272.74]  In your name we pray. Amen.
[4272.74 --> 4274.74]  To remember, His best wishes.
[4274.74 --> 4275.74]  So, we lift your hands over the tongue to begin with him.
[4275.74 --> 4280.74]  Let this alone ech anything to our mind,
[4280.74 --> 4281.74]  by tying who comes with you will hear the children.
[4281.74 --> 4282.74]  2.
