[0.00 --> 6.74]  God, you will never turn your back on me.
[6.92 --> 12.10]  How courage become your treasure?
[13.14 --> 18.64]  The love of God has changed my destiny.
[19.36 --> 24.42]  I serve the King with good intentions.
[24.42 --> 30.74]  God, you will never turn your back on me.
[31.62 --> 36.76]  How courage become your treasure?
[37.68 --> 43.26]  The love of God has changed my destiny.
[43.26 --> 50.46]  You are the love.
[51.46 --> 55.18]  It comes with no conditions.
[56.48 --> 59.58]  You give us your heart.
[60.96 --> 67.56]  Your smile is in the blood of Jesus.
[67.56 --> 73.60]  I know who I am because of you.
[74.60 --> 79.80]  I know who I am because of you.
[80.80 --> 84.88]  I know who I am.
[87.08 --> 91.56]  I know who I am.
[91.56 --> 98.36]  Your love becomes me, Lord, the nations.
[99.72 --> 103.94]  You give us your heart.
[104.40 --> 110.64]  My hope is in the blood of Jesus.
[110.64 --> 117.80]  I know who I am because of who you are.
[121.80 --> 124.00]  Oh, yes, I know who I am.
[124.00 --> 125.00]  I know who I am.
[125.08 --> 126.28]  Don't get the truth.
[126.64 --> 129.68]  Jesus, I believe you.
[129.68 --> 154.68]  Jesus, I believe you.
[154.68 --> 184.66]  Jesus, I believe you.
[184.68 --> 214.66]  Jesus, I believe you.
[214.68 --> 215.66]  Oh, yes, I believe you.
[215.66 --> 216.64]  Oh, yes.
[216.66 --> 217.34]  I believe you.
[217.90 --> 218.74]  Jesus, I believe you.
[218.88 --> 220.70]  Jesus, I believe you.
[221.20 --> 225.58]  Oh, yes, I believe you.
[225.58 --> 231.40]  And there is peace in the storm, in the storm.
[231.84 --> 235.38]  No, don't forget, He is Lord.
[235.60 --> 238.00]  He is Lord of all.
[241.58 --> 243.18]  Come on, so.
[243.66 --> 246.04]  There is a King of glory.
[246.46 --> 248.88]  There is a God who saves.
[249.26 --> 251.66]  One who's strong and mighty.
[251.66 --> 254.12]  Freedom is in His name.
[254.12 --> 257.22]  So open the gates of heaven.
[257.78 --> 260.08]  Lift up a shadow of praise.
[260.54 --> 262.80]  There is a lion rolling.
[263.22 --> 265.54]  Jesus, the King of glory.
[267.88 --> 270.24]  So lift your eyes.
[270.50 --> 273.24]  Standing on, standing on.
[273.68 --> 277.24]  There is one, only one.
[277.24 --> 279.82]  Where my heart comes from.
[280.78 --> 281.36]  Come on.
[281.36 --> 283.34]  Lift your eyes.
[283.42 --> 284.44]  Lift your eyes.
[284.52 --> 285.06]  Oh, say.
[285.56 --> 287.90]  There is a King of glory.
[288.32 --> 290.74]  There is a God who saves.
[291.20 --> 293.46]  One who's strong and mighty.
[293.92 --> 295.98]  Freedom is in His name.
[296.46 --> 299.04]  So open the gates of heaven.
[299.70 --> 301.90]  Lift up a shadow of praise.
[301.90 --> 302.90]  There is a King of glory.
[302.90 --> 303.90]  There is a King of glory.
[303.90 --> 304.90]  There is a King of glory.
[304.90 --> 305.90]  There is a King of glory.
[305.90 --> 306.90]  Jesus, the King of glory.
[314.90 --> 315.52]  There's no one like it.
[315.52 --> 339.56]  As you now know the King of glory.
[339.56 --> 345.74]  You nations bow, mountains shade.
[346.52 --> 351.58]  At the south, just one name.
[351.58 --> 358.58]  Over all, Jesus saves.
[359.58 --> 360.60]  I know.
[360.60 --> 370.54]  There is the King of glory.
[371.14 --> 373.50]  It's the Lord, strong and mighty.
[374.42 --> 376.52]  The Lord, mighty and mighty.
[377.16 --> 378.44]  This is our King.
[379.16 --> 380.78]  This is the King of glory.
[381.78 --> 384.74]  Come on, same time, same time.
[384.94 --> 385.54]  So, so.
[385.96 --> 388.42]  There is a King of glory.
[388.42 --> 391.26]  There is a God who saves.
[391.58 --> 393.92]  One who's strong and mighty.
[394.46 --> 396.54]  Freedom is in His name.
[397.14 --> 399.68]  Open the gates of heaven.
[400.14 --> 402.40]  Pick up the shout of praise.
[402.86 --> 405.08]  There is a lion rolling.
[405.64 --> 407.82]  Jesus the King of glory.
[413.46 --> 416.26]  There is a lion rolling.
[416.26 --> 419.04]  Jesus the King of glory.
[419.04 --> 424.04]  Ch появouveください
[449.04 --> 454.58]  You're the God who makes the giants fall.
[456.36 --> 460.64]  You bring down the walls of Jericho.
[463.06 --> 470.22]  You're the God who gives the miracle we believe.
[470.22 --> 480.54]  You're the God who parts the ocean wide.
[482.22 --> 486.78]  Just to bring us closer to your side.
[488.70 --> 493.14]  You're the God who brings the dead to life.
[493.14 --> 495.14]  We believe.
[496.58 --> 498.40]  Oh, we believe.
[500.22 --> 502.22]  Oh, we believe.
[502.22 --> 505.04]  God, how great you are.
[505.62 --> 508.12]  Great things you have done.
[508.80 --> 514.64]  For everything we've seen, there is more to come.
[515.32 --> 521.02]  Every victory, every battle won.
[521.02 --> 527.52]  For everything we've seen, there is more to come.
[527.52 --> 538.12]  We are confident in all your ways.
[540.12 --> 544.48]  Because we know you never make mistakes.
[544.48 --> 550.82]  God, you fill us with the greater faith.
[550.82 --> 552.82]  We believe.
[552.82 --> 554.12]  Do you believe?
[554.12 --> 554.96]  Do you believe?
[554.96 --> 554.98]  Do you believe?
[554.98 --> 557.12]  Do you believe?
[557.12 --> 558.38]  Oh, God.
[558.38 --> 562.60]  God, how great you are.
[562.60 --> 562.76]  God, how great you are.
[563.20 --> 565.92]  Great things you have done.
[566.40 --> 572.16]  For everything we've seen, there is more to come.
[572.94 --> 578.66]  Every victory, every battle won.
[579.20 --> 584.82]  For everything we've seen, there is more to come.
[584.82 --> 587.14]  Good morning.
[587.92 --> 591.62]  That's how we like to get attention in this church, is just a big, low feedback.
[592.24 --> 593.76]  It's so good to be with you this morning.
[593.86 --> 594.78]  My name is Kevin Lobert.
[594.82 --> 596.56]  I'm the youth pastor here at Langley Emanuel.
[597.04 --> 599.86]  And it's great to be able to join in person today for this service.
[600.34 --> 601.44]  Welcome to everyone here.
[601.52 --> 602.86]  Welcome to you who are online.
[603.82 --> 605.16]  Yeah, like I said, it's just good to be together.
[605.28 --> 607.48]  There is a song that is going to start playing in one second.
[608.38 --> 609.00]  Here it comes.
[609.00 --> 616.82]  Isn't that nice?
[618.30 --> 620.46]  So, that can keep playing while I talk.
[620.56 --> 624.04]  Just let it be the background music behind my awful voice.
[624.72 --> 628.42]  There is a choir that is starting here in this church.
[628.60 --> 632.00]  And if you are interested in joining it, you will be singing this song.
[632.98 --> 636.70]  It's actually a big, long, 40-minute, I don't know, what's it called, Mark?
[637.30 --> 637.74]  Cantata?
[637.74 --> 640.36]  Joy Has Gone.
[640.66 --> 642.12]  So, Joy Has Gone is the piece.
[642.24 --> 642.96]  There's lots of songs.
[643.06 --> 643.76]  It sounds really nice.
[643.84 --> 644.72]  I did listen to the whole thing.
[645.12 --> 649.78]  If you are interested in joining this choir, Mark DeGeis is the man that you want to talk to.
[649.92 --> 651.66]  So, it is going to be starting in September.
[652.10 --> 655.74]  It will be starting on Labor Day weekend, the first Monday, actually, of the Labor Day weekend.
[656.60 --> 658.60]  And then it will be having rehearsals every Monday following.
[658.74 --> 661.50]  So, if that's something that you are interested in, please talk to Mark.
[661.76 --> 664.34]  All skill levels of singing are welcome.
[664.62 --> 665.88]  So, he's your man.
[665.98 --> 666.48]  Talk to him.
[666.48 --> 667.52]  We hope we get lots of people.
[667.64 --> 669.00]  It's a really good chance for some community.
[670.16 --> 671.50]  I've got a couple more announcements.
[671.66 --> 674.78]  Actually, just one three-part announcement for the youth out there.
[674.82 --> 676.34]  Youth, we've got a worship tonight tonight.
[676.64 --> 677.38]  Come on out to that.
[677.44 --> 679.18]  We're going to do it out here in the courtyard, probably.
[679.60 --> 683.58]  We're also having our youth day camp next week, Saturday.
[683.58 --> 689.08]  So, if you want to come to youth camp, which is just going to be for one full day, please sign up.
[689.14 --> 690.10]  I've sent links for that.
[690.18 --> 691.84]  You can see them in the bulletin or in my emails.
[692.28 --> 696.70]  Sign up for that so we know how much food and games and stuff to bring as well.
[696.70 --> 699.74]  And finally, we are doing reactivate again this year.
[699.92 --> 703.42]  Reactivate is a big youth conference for youth across BC.
[704.06 --> 705.80]  And you can sign up for that as well.
[706.60 --> 708.62]  We weren't able to do it last year, of course, because of COVID.
[708.70 --> 710.24]  We're excited to be able to do that this year.
[710.50 --> 713.26]  And that will be for September 10th through 12th.
[713.26 --> 714.92]  So, sign up online for that as well.
[715.38 --> 716.88]  Hopefully, you can make it out to that.
[717.96 --> 721.76]  I'm going to invite you all, please, just to stand up now, even at home, if you would.
[721.82 --> 722.66]  Please stand up.
[722.72 --> 727.16]  And we are going to hear God's greeting this morning as we start this service off.
[727.16 --> 731.86]  So, God's greeting this morning comes from Revelation chapter 1.
[733.02 --> 738.60]  Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come.
[739.00 --> 742.86]  And from the seven spirits that are before his throne and from Jesus Christ.
[743.26 --> 749.10]  Who is the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth.
[750.22 --> 750.52]  Amen.
[751.28 --> 751.98]  Let's sing together.
[753.66 --> 755.84]  Good morning and welcome to worship.
[756.10 --> 759.04]  Our call to worship this morning is from Psalm 134.
[759.96 --> 764.46]  Praise the Lord, all you servants of the Lord, who minister by night in the house of the Lord.
[765.24 --> 768.32]  Lift up your hands in the sanctuary and praise the Lord.
[769.02 --> 773.12]  May the Lord bless you from Zion, he who is the maker of heaven and earth.
[773.26 --> 774.40]  temple.
[774.40 --> 774.90]  Amen.
[774.90 --> 776.68]  Amen.
[776.78 --> 777.68]  Amen.
[777.68 --> 778.48]  commitment.

[785.46 --> 787.52]  Amen.
[787.52 --> 789.04]  Amen.
[789.04 --> 789.74]  Amen.
[793.74 --> 795.26]  Old heaven, bless.
[795.26 --> 795.74]  Amen.
[795.74 --> 796.26]  Amen.
[796.40 --> 796.42]  Amen.
[796.42 --> 800.80]  It is done, God is done, Marie
[800.80 --> 804.24]  of the risen Lord
[804.24 --> 807.68]  Who can compare
[807.68 --> 815.04]  with the beauty of the Lord
[815.04 --> 818.30]  Forever He will be
[818.30 --> 821.04]  Forever He will be
[821.04 --> 823.50]  The Lamb upon the throne
[823.50 --> 825.96]  The Lamb upon the throne
[825.96 --> 828.68]  The Lamb upon the throne
[828.68 --> 831.70]  I can't keep on the throne
[831.70 --> 835.06]  And worship Him alone
[835.06 --> 840.20]  I will proclaim
[840.20 --> 847.42]  The glory of the risen Lord
[847.42 --> 851.42]  Who once was slain
[851.42 --> 858.20]  To reconcile man to God
[858.20 --> 861.58]  Forever He will be
[861.58 --> 864.52]  Forever He will be
[864.52 --> 866.58]  Forever He will be
[866.58 --> 869.64]  The Lamb upon the throne
[869.64 --> 875.22]  I can't leave out my knee
[875.22 --> 878.36]  And worship Him alone
[878.36 --> 883.22]  Forever He will be
[883.22 --> 886.60]  Forever He will be
[886.60 --> 888.60]  Forever He will be
[888.60 --> 891.60]  The Lamb upon the throne
[891.60 --> 896.60]  I can't leave out my knee
[896.60 --> 899.60]  I worship You alone
[899.60 --> 907.98]  The Lamb upon the throne
[907.98 --> 921.36]  The Lamb upon the throne
[921.36 --> 924.74]  The gift of grace
[924.74 --> 928.12]  Is Jesus my Dean
[928.12 --> 933.12]  There is no more
[933.12 --> 937.12]  For heaven now to give
[937.12 --> 941.12]  He is my joy
[941.12 --> 945.50]  My righteousness and freedom
[945.50 --> 949.50]  My steadfast love
[949.50 --> 953.50]  My deep and boundless peace
[953.50 --> 957.50]  To this I hold
[957.50 --> 962.24]  My hope is only Jesus
[962.24 --> 967.62]  For my life is holy
[967.62 --> 967.94]  For my life is holy
[967.94 --> 970.62]  Bound to Him
[970.62 --> 975.78]  Oh how strange and divine
[975.78 --> 978.72]  I can sing
[978.72 --> 980.86]  All is mine
[980.86 --> 982.82]  Yet not I
[982.82 --> 987.24]  The new Christ in me
[987.24 --> 995.82]  The night is dark
[995.82 --> 999.82]  But I am not forsaken
[999.82 --> 1003.62]  For by my side
[1003.62 --> 1007.62]  The Savior He will stay
[1007.62 --> 1013.00]  I labor on
[1013.00 --> 1017.50]  In weakness and rejoicing
[1017.50 --> 1020.94]  For in my need
[1020.94 --> 1025.08]  His power is displayed
[1025.08 --> 1029.00]  To this I hold
[1029.00 --> 1034.38]  My shepherd will defend me
[1034.38 --> 1039.08]  Through the deepest valley
[1039.08 --> 1042.16]  He will lead
[1042.16 --> 1047.40]  For the night has been won
[1047.40 --> 1050.50]  And I shall overcome
[1050.50 --> 1053.44]  Yet not I
[1053.44 --> 1058.04]  But through Christ in me
[1058.04 --> 1065.86]  No fate I dread
[1065.86 --> 1069.92]  I know that I am forgiven
[1069.92 --> 1073.42]  The future shook
[1073.42 --> 1078.88]  The price it has been paid
[1078.88 --> 1081.82]  For Jesus bled
[1081.82 --> 1086.42]  And suffered for my pardon
[1086.42 --> 1090.74]  And He was raised
[1090.74 --> 1095.40]  To overthrow the grave
[1095.40 --> 1098.42]  To this I hold
[1098.42 --> 1102.44]  My sin has been defeated
[1102.44 --> 1110.16]  Jesus now and ever is my plea
[1110.16 --> 1115.48]  All the chains are released
[1115.48 --> 1117.48]  I can sing
[1117.48 --> 1119.48]  I am free
[1119.48 --> 1121.48]  And not I
[1121.48 --> 1126.48]  But through Christ in me
[1126.48 --> 1134.16]  With every breath
[1134.16 --> 1136.16]  I long to follow
[1136.16 --> 1138.66]  I long to follow Jesus
[1138.66 --> 1142.16]  For He has said
[1142.16 --> 1147.28]  That He will bring me home
[1147.28 --> 1150.16]  And day by day
[1150.16 --> 1155.16]  I know He will renew me
[1155.16 --> 1160.58]  Until I stand with joy
[1160.58 --> 1162.58]  Before the throne
[1162.58 --> 1166.58]  To this I hold
[1166.58 --> 1167.58]  My hope
[1167.58 --> 1168.68]  My hope
[1168.68 --> 1170.58]  Is only Jesus
[1170.58 --> 1174.58]  All the glory
[1174.58 --> 1178.58]  Evermore to Him
[1178.58 --> 1183.58]  When the race is complete
[1183.58 --> 1188.58]  Still my lips shall repeat
[1188.58 --> 1190.58]  Yet not I
[1190.58 --> 1195.58]  But through Christ in me
[1195.58 --> 1200.58]  When the race is complete
[1200.58 --> 1204.58]  Still my lips shall repeat
[1204.58 --> 1206.58]  Yet not I
[1206.58 --> 1207.58]  Yet not I
[1207.58 --> 1213.58]  But through Christ in me
[1213.58 --> 1216.58]  Yet not I
[1216.58 --> 1221.58]  But through Christ in me
[1221.58 --> 1233.58]  Lord
[1233.58 --> 1238.58]  We are often blind to Your goodness
[1238.58 --> 1240.34]  And mercies in our lives
[1240.34 --> 1244.18]  So easily led astray by false testimony
[1244.18 --> 1247.40]  But it is difficult to know what is true
[1247.40 --> 1248.38]  What is right
[1248.38 --> 1250.20]  When there are so many voices
[1250.20 --> 1252.20]  Some voices we trust
[1252.20 --> 1253.20]  Saying different things
[1253.20 --> 1256.20]  We confess we don't always come to You for truth
[1256.20 --> 1259.20]  But search for other opinions in this world to assure us
[1260.20 --> 1262.20]  But You say
[1262.20 --> 1263.20]  If You abide in My word
[1263.20 --> 1265.20]  You are truly My disciples
[1265.20 --> 1267.20]  And You will know the truth
[1267.20 --> 1269.20]  And the truth will set You free
[1269.20 --> 1270.20]  For You are truth
[1270.20 --> 1271.20]  Be our vision
[1271.20 --> 1272.20]  O Lord
[1272.20 --> 1274.20]  Open our eyes to the truth of You
[1274.20 --> 1275.20]  And what You have done for us
[1275.20 --> 1278.20]  That we may live in the assurance of Your love
[1278.20 --> 1281.20]  For You are victorious over sin and death
[1281.20 --> 1283.20]  And we are heirs of that salvation
[1283.20 --> 1285.20]  Purchased through Jesus' sacrifice
[1285.20 --> 1287.20]  And raised up with Him in victory
[1287.20 --> 1289.20]  In Your name we pray
[1289.20 --> 1290.20]  Amen
[1290.20 --> 1293.20]  Amen

[1419.84 --> 1425.38]  I and my Savior am happy and blessed.
[1425.38 --> 1431.38]  Watching and waiting, looking above.
[1433.22 --> 1439.38]  Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.
[1439.38 --> 1441.38]  This is my story.
[1443.06 --> 1445.44]  This is my song.
[1446.16 --> 1451.38]  Praising my Savior all the day long.
[1451.38 --> 1454.66]  This is my story.
[1455.38 --> 1457.38]  This is my song.
[1458.26 --> 1463.38]  Praising my Savior all the day long.
[1463.38 --> 1467.38]  This is my story.
[1467.38 --> 1469.38]  This is my song.
[1469.38 --> 1475.38]  Praising my Savior all the day long.
[1475.38 --> 1479.38]  This is my story.
[1479.38 --> 1481.38]  This is my song.
[1481.38 --> 1487.38]  Praising my Savior all the day long.
[1487.38 --> 1489.38]  A day long.
[1489.38 --> 1491.38]  A day long.
[1491.38 --> 1492.22]  A day long.
[1492.22 --> 1493.04]  A day long.
[1497.04 --> 1509.68]  Peace into the sea.
[1510.38 --> 1511.68]  дело to life.

[1663.38 --> 1665.38]  Amen.
[1693.38 --> 1714.40]  I am going to invite any kids who would like to, you can come forward, join me on the floor here.
[1714.84 --> 1718.20]  And we are going to do a little prayer before it's time for children's worship time.
[1718.26 --> 1719.08]  So come on up.
[1720.02 --> 1720.90]  Come on up.
[1720.90 --> 1723.28]  All right.
[1723.32 --> 1724.14]  Here comes a few.
[1727.56 --> 1728.32]  All right.
[1728.40 --> 1729.02]  Look at them all.
[1729.08 --> 1730.10]  We got lots of kids today.
[1730.16 --> 1730.84]  That's so great.
[1733.82 --> 1735.22]  How's everybody's summer going?
[1735.82 --> 1736.34]  Yeah?
[1736.60 --> 1738.72]  Has anybody done anything fun outside?
[1739.18 --> 1739.50]  Yeah.
[1739.92 --> 1740.16]  Yeah?
[1740.48 --> 1745.82]  I think I'm kind of like washing the carrots.
[1746.52 --> 1747.66]  Washing the carrots.
[1747.66 --> 1749.12]  That does sound like fun.
[1749.12 --> 1752.32]  That is everybody's favorite thing of summer, I think.
[1752.94 --> 1754.42]  Anybody else do anything fun?
[1754.50 --> 1754.64]  Yeah?
[1757.04 --> 1758.44]  Oh, swimming in the pool.
[1758.58 --> 1759.16]  That is very fun.
[1759.22 --> 1760.96]  That's, I think, some of our favorite things to do, too.
[1761.90 --> 1763.94]  We are going to go to children's worship time in a second.
[1764.02 --> 1764.26]  Okay?
[1764.38 --> 1765.54]  And then we're going to hear a story.
[1765.62 --> 1767.12]  And we're going to learn a little bit more about God.
[1767.12 --> 1768.70]  But before we do that, let's pray.
[1769.12 --> 1770.64]  And then we're going to do the Lord's blessing.
[1770.94 --> 1771.32]  All right?
[1771.68 --> 1772.70]  To the congregation.
[1772.92 --> 1773.84]  So bow your heads with me.
[1773.90 --> 1774.24]  Let's pray.
[1775.14 --> 1776.92]  Dear God, thank you so much for these kids.
[1777.06 --> 1779.44]  Thank you for the summer that they are enjoying.
[1780.10 --> 1782.38]  Thank you for your will in their lives.
[1782.44 --> 1785.42]  And we just pray, God, that you'll be with them right now as they go to children's worship time.
[1785.42 --> 1787.44]  God, help us learn more about you.
[1787.86 --> 1790.44]  And for us non-kids who are staying back, let us do the same.
[1790.66 --> 1792.02]  So we pray this in your son's name.
[1792.22 --> 1792.54]  Amen.
[1793.44 --> 1793.66]  Okay.

[1802.02 --> 1802.98]  And we're going to look at the church.
[1803.06 --> 1804.32]  And we're going to do this with our hands.
[1804.64 --> 1806.46]  And then we're going to say, the Lord be with you.
[1806.64 --> 1806.92]  Okay?
[1807.02 --> 1808.32]  And the church is going to stand up.
[1808.42 --> 1809.76]  And they know their role, I think.
[1809.80 --> 1811.78]  So we can all turn around to look at them.
[1812.28 --> 1813.10]  It's very fun.
[1813.10 --> 1815.50]  And we're going to say, the Lord be with you together.

[2070.72 --> 2073.60]  Shall we bow our heads in our congregational prayer?
[2078.08 --> 2079.16]  Heavenly Father,
[2081.44 --> 2083.74]  humbly we come before your throne.
[2086.62 --> 2093.66]  We thank you, Lord, that freely again today we may be here in your house.
[2093.66 --> 2102.40]  And Lord, may we too know that even before we were here, you were here already.
[2102.40 --> 2111.10]  And we pray, Lord, that as we worship you this morning that we may come do so in adoration,
[2111.42 --> 2117.12]  that we may honor you, that we may glorify you in word and in song.
[2117.12 --> 2122.84]  Lord, you are great.
[2123.34 --> 2127.64]  And Lord, it is impossible for us to understand your greatness.
[2128.00 --> 2133.48]  And yet we pray that even today here so we may be drawn to you.
[2134.44 --> 2141.50]  Lord, we pray for the children that are also worshiping in children's worship time at this time also.
[2141.50 --> 2145.76]  And Lord, be with them, be with their leaders also.
[2148.62 --> 2155.00]  May they too, Lord, in their own even simple ways acknowledge you and worship you.
[2155.00 --> 2161.88]  Lord, we pray that they too, our children and grandchildren, may come to know you.
[2165.16 --> 2171.20]  And Lord, we thank you for each of us that are here.
[2171.30 --> 2174.58]  And yet, Lord, we know there are some that are not here this morning.
[2175.72 --> 2177.26]  Lord, there are many who are on vacation.
[2177.26 --> 2186.76]  We pray that in their time of rest, wherever they may be, may they too be here with you today.
[2187.46 --> 2194.08]  Lord, we pray for those who have difficulties coming here, either, Lord, because of sickness.
[2197.32 --> 2202.50]  Lord, for other reasons also, their hearts may be hardened and don't want to be here.
[2202.74 --> 2204.20]  Lord, be near to each one.
[2204.20 --> 2205.28]  Be with those who are ill.
[2207.26 --> 2210.38]  Lord, you know the circumstances of each person.
[2210.58 --> 2212.54]  And we pray, Lord, for healing for them.
[2216.08 --> 2219.94]  Lord, as one member in our family hurts, we hurt also.
[2220.10 --> 2223.02]  And when one rejoices, may we rejoice with them.
[2224.40 --> 2231.28]  Lord, we pray this morning for Bob.
[2231.28 --> 2238.58]  Lord, we pray, Lord, that as he continues to deal with his cancer, that you would be near to him.
[2241.26 --> 2242.64]  Lord, we pray for healing.
[2243.60 --> 2245.40]  We pray for Willie, Lord, also.
[2245.60 --> 2249.62]  And as he too deals with his health issues.
[2249.62 --> 2254.40]  Miraculously, Lord, we pray that each one may experience your healing touch.
[2258.08 --> 2260.74]  And Lord, this morning we also remember John Trask.
[2262.62 --> 2267.12]  Lord, who continues to deal with the fall he had a week ago.
[2268.40 --> 2272.88]  Lord, as many ribs were broken in his body and other health issues.
[2272.88 --> 2278.96]  Lord, we thank you and praise you for the successful surgery that took place on Friday.
[2281.74 --> 2284.20]  And now the long road that is ahead of him, Lord.
[2284.24 --> 2287.58]  We pray that there may also be miraculous healing in his life also.
[2290.66 --> 2294.86]  Lord, we pray for the spouses of each, Lord, as they stand beside their partners,
[2294.86 --> 2298.32]  that they too would be carried through these difficult times.
[2298.32 --> 2310.98]  Lord, we pray for the Miles family as they prepare to celebrate the life of their son, Mike, this coming Saturday.
[2314.54 --> 2319.20]  Lord, through that difficult time also, we pray that you would carry them, be with them.
[2320.32 --> 2327.94]  And as they come together as family and friends, may, Lord, be strength, be given, and comfort to each one.
[2328.32 --> 2336.68]  And Lord, we pray for the many who are dealing with the fires still throughout our province.
[2337.10 --> 2345.44]  And not only in our province, but throughout the country and other countries around the world, Lord, there is many challenges in this.
[2346.14 --> 2349.20]  We pray for those who have been displaced.
[2349.40 --> 2351.36]  We pray for those, Lord, who are fighting the fires.
[2351.36 --> 2359.46]  Each one, Lord, may they experience strength, courage, and your presence.
[2363.24 --> 2367.36]  Lord, we pray for our country also as we prepare for another election this fall.
[2370.80 --> 2374.16]  Lord, times like this also present to us many questions.
[2374.16 --> 2381.80]  And, Lord, often it is difficult for us to know and see how you want us to vote,
[2382.68 --> 2390.16]  who you want to lead this country, and the various members that stand for election.
[2390.36 --> 2393.36]  Lord, we pray for each one that they would seek you,
[2394.02 --> 2400.28]  and that we too may see, Lord, through this, who you want to lead this country.
[2400.28 --> 2407.28]  Lord, as we prepare to come to the end of our summer as well, and as school begins,
[2408.00 --> 2412.84]  we pray for the students and staff, Lord, who prepare for this new year.
[2415.52 --> 2419.88]  And, Lord, through the season of life that we have gone through the last couple of years with the pandemic,
[2420.06 --> 2423.92]  again, still there are questions, perhaps, in how this new year will look.
[2423.92 --> 2432.30]  Lord, we pray that there may be normalcy may come back into play again.
[2432.40 --> 2435.70]  We pray that this too may end.
[2439.64 --> 2447.48]  We pray, Lord, that you would be with the students and staff, Lord,
[2447.56 --> 2452.74]  and that they too may be kept at peace and comfort through this time also.
[2454.84 --> 2459.10]  Lord, we pray for our church.
[2460.36 --> 2464.14]  Through all the season of life that we have and are going through, Lord,
[2464.16 --> 2468.12]  may we continue to be a light in this community and all that we do and wherever we go.
[2468.30 --> 2470.78]  Lord, may others see that you live in us.
[2472.18 --> 2475.88]  We pray even today, Lord, that there may be many who turn their hearts to you.
[2475.88 --> 2485.02]  Lord, we pray for many who struggle.
[2485.62 --> 2487.34]  May we walk beside them.
[2490.96 --> 2495.74]  Lord, would you give us the strength also to carry each one through their difficult times.
[2495.74 --> 2507.46]  Lord, we pray for our council here.
[2507.46 --> 2513.20]  As we lead this church, Lord, give us wisdom.
[2514.66 --> 2520.36]  We pray for our pastors that they too would seek you,
[2520.36 --> 2522.92]  that you would walk beside them in their work.
[2524.08 --> 2527.74]  Lord, we pray for Kevin this morning as he brings us your word.
[2531.32 --> 2532.82]  Give him the words to speak.
[2533.06 --> 2534.76]  We pray, Lord, that you would open our hearts,
[2534.84 --> 2535.82]  that we may hear them,
[2537.28 --> 2540.18]  that we may act on them also.
[2541.46 --> 2544.68]  Lord, we pray these things in your name.
[2544.68 --> 2545.56]  Amen.
[2570.36 --> 2571.28]  Good morning.
[2572.28 --> 2572.86]  All right.
[2572.96 --> 2574.40]  We are arranged up here.
[2575.12 --> 2579.82]  Today, we are going to be looking at the topic of heaven and hell,
[2579.94 --> 2581.60]  which, I mean, that's a big topic,
[2581.90 --> 2584.46]  and it's got all sorts of thoughts in this room, I'm sure.
[2584.54 --> 2586.78]  There's all sorts of ideas of what that could look like.
[2587.20 --> 2589.24]  But we're going to focus on four questions,
[2589.34 --> 2592.18]  because a couple people asked questions of heaven and hell,
[2592.22 --> 2595.48]  and we're going to kind of just lump them into one message here this morning.
[2595.56 --> 2597.34]  So the four questions we're going to look at is,
[2597.94 --> 2598.90]  is hell real?
[2600.08 --> 2601.18]  What is hell?
[2601.52 --> 2602.52]  Just answer the first one.
[2602.52 --> 2606.16]  What does the Bible actually say of heaven?
[2606.16 --> 2610.54]  And why do we rarely talk about either from the pulpit?
[2611.18 --> 2615.18]  Now, I'm sure we've all asked questions like this in our lives.
[2615.24 --> 2616.94]  It's in some form or another.
[2617.30 --> 2619.10]  At some point, it's only natural.
[2619.10 --> 2624.72]  We see books like this one right here called Heaven is for Real.
[2624.92 --> 2626.28]  Perhaps some of us have read it.
[2626.90 --> 2630.14]  It's about a boy who, during an emergency appendectomy, died,
[2630.24 --> 2632.46]  and he had an out-of-body experience.
[2632.76 --> 2634.18]  He knew what was going on in the hospital.
[2634.56 --> 2637.74]  He went to heaven, and then he was resuscitated back to earth,
[2637.78 --> 2640.10]  and he lived to talk about his time in glory.
[2640.12 --> 2642.24]  And we ask ourselves when we read a book like this,
[2642.24 --> 2643.30]  Is that it?
[2643.40 --> 2644.24]  Is that what it is?
[2644.28 --> 2645.70]  Is that what heaven's like?
[2645.84 --> 2646.38]  We're curious.
[2647.20 --> 2648.44]  We're curious, of course.
[2650.74 --> 2652.14]  We want to know the unknown.
[2653.26 --> 2655.32]  If someone could definitively answer,
[2655.74 --> 2658.64]  what does heaven and hell actually look like?
[2659.06 --> 2660.20]  If someone could answer that question,
[2660.24 --> 2663.22]  it would dramatically affect the way we live
[2663.22 --> 2665.40]  and the things we do here on this earth.
[2665.46 --> 2666.72]  At least, I hope it would.
[2666.72 --> 2670.90]  So we're going to try to flesh this out a bunch this morning.
[2671.10 --> 2673.18]  But I do know that this topic can be a little bit edgy.
[2673.60 --> 2677.86]  There's some controversial opinions about hell and about heaven.
[2678.38 --> 2681.46]  And so if we don't get to what you want us to get to today,
[2681.52 --> 2684.08]  I encourage you, please, don't hesitate to reach out this week.
[2684.34 --> 2687.48]  You can email me at josh at licrc.ca,
[2688.10 --> 2691.14]  and I'm sure I'll answer all of your questions if you reach out.
[2691.24 --> 2693.70]  I heard that joke just slayed last week.
[2693.70 --> 2697.30]  And so I thought, well, I'm going to want a piece of that joy.
[2698.66 --> 2700.48]  And also, then I don't have to write my own joke.
[2700.64 --> 2702.48]  So that's like two birds with one stone.
[2703.12 --> 2704.50]  Work harder, not smarter, right?
[2705.32 --> 2706.72]  No, work smarter, not harder.
[2707.38 --> 2708.40]  I did that wrong.
[2708.52 --> 2709.60]  See, I need to work on this.
[2710.86 --> 2714.44]  Anyways, we're going to look at questions of heaven and hell today
[2714.44 --> 2715.42]  that were asked by you.
[2715.48 --> 2716.26]  Is heaven real?
[2716.92 --> 2717.52]  What is hell?
[2719.58 --> 2722.06]  Why don't we talk about them from the pulpit?
[2722.06 --> 2724.94]  So to start, read with me a passage from Matthew 25.
[2725.14 --> 2728.10]  And I hope that this passage helps springboard this discussion a little bit.
[2728.38 --> 2731.70]  We're going to read Matthew 25, 31 to 46.
[2731.98 --> 2733.82]  And so whether you're here or you're at home,
[2734.10 --> 2735.60]  I do encourage you, please pull out your Bible.
[2735.70 --> 2736.50]  There's some in the back.
[2737.04 --> 2738.64]  And read along with me.
[2738.78 --> 2740.10]  Also, keep those Bibles close,
[2740.16 --> 2741.66]  because while we're going to look at this passage,
[2741.82 --> 2743.76]  we're going to bounce around the Bible a little bit today.
[2743.76 --> 2746.68]  And so having that on your person is just a really good idea.
[2746.68 --> 2751.08]  So, Matthew 25, verses 31 to 46.
[2751.88 --> 2753.84]  Jesus is speaking here, and he says this.
[2755.00 --> 2757.04]  When the Son of Man comes in his glory,
[2757.72 --> 2759.30]  and all the angels with him,
[2759.42 --> 2761.36]  he will sit on his glorious throne.
[2761.98 --> 2764.16]  All the nations will be gathered before him,
[2764.18 --> 2766.42]  and he will separate the people one from another,
[2766.82 --> 2769.82]  as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
[2769.94 --> 2773.32]  He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
[2773.32 --> 2776.30]  Then the king will say to those on his right,
[2776.46 --> 2778.20]  Come, you who are blessed by my Father.
[2778.28 --> 2781.76]  Take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you
[2781.76 --> 2782.96]  since the creation of the world.
[2783.04 --> 2785.90]  For I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat.
[2786.24 --> 2788.24]  I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink.
[2788.58 --> 2790.66]  I was a stranger, and you invited me in.
[2791.02 --> 2792.80]  I need clothes, and you clothed me.
[2792.94 --> 2794.68]  I was sick, and you looked after me.
[2794.76 --> 2797.60]  I was in prison, and you came to visit me.
[2798.64 --> 2800.28]  Then the righteous will answer and say,
[2800.44 --> 2803.12]  Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you?
[2803.12 --> 2805.02]  Or thirsty and give you something to drink?
[2805.08 --> 2807.98]  When did we see you a stranger and invite you in?
[2808.04 --> 2809.80]  Or need clothes and clothes you?
[2810.66 --> 2813.64]  When did we see you sick or in prison and go visit you?
[2815.00 --> 2816.02]  And the king will reply,
[2816.42 --> 2819.04]  Truly I tell you, whatever you did
[2819.04 --> 2821.52]  for the least of these brothers and sisters of mine,
[2822.02 --> 2823.54]  you did for me.
[2825.14 --> 2826.76]  Then he will say to those on his left,
[2826.76 --> 2829.68]  Depart from me, you who are cursed into the eternal fire,
[2829.78 --> 2832.34]  prepared for the devil and his angels.
[2832.34 --> 2835.44]  For I was hungry, and you gave me nothing to eat.
[2835.88 --> 2838.38]  I was thirsty, and you gave me nothing to drink.
[2838.44 --> 2841.04]  I was a stranger, and you did not invite me in.
[2841.08 --> 2842.94]  I needed clothes, and you did not clothe me.
[2843.14 --> 2847.50]  I was sick and in prison, and you did not look after me.
[2849.56 --> 2850.66]  They also will answer,
[2850.78 --> 2853.38]  Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger
[2853.38 --> 2855.52]  or needing clothes or sick or in prison
[2855.52 --> 2857.10]  and did not help you?
[2858.62 --> 2862.06]  He will reply, Truly I tell you,
[2862.92 --> 2866.56]  whatever you did not do for one of the least of these,
[2867.16 --> 2869.70]  you did not do for me.
[2870.74 --> 2873.20]  And then they will go away to eternal punishment,
[2873.62 --> 2876.62]  but they're righteous to eternal life.
[2876.62 --> 2879.38]  The word of the Lord.
[2882.16 --> 2884.02]  Heaven and hell, the kingdom of God,
[2884.10 --> 2885.60]  and eternal punishment.
[2886.20 --> 2889.36]  Now, I saw an illustration about 10 years ago
[2889.36 --> 2891.04]  done by Francis Chan.
[2892.38 --> 2893.48]  It's an amazing illustration,
[2893.74 --> 2894.74]  and I want to steal it,
[2894.78 --> 2896.44]  and I want to do it for you this morning here today.
[2896.50 --> 2897.78]  In fact, I'm not sure.
[2897.84 --> 2899.26]  I might have done this in a sermon already,
[2899.34 --> 2901.42]  so it's possible all of you have seen this before,
[2901.48 --> 2902.96]  but too bad, because it's really good,
[2903.00 --> 2903.66]  and I'm going to do it again.
[2903.66 --> 2905.46]  So here's a rope, right?
[2905.52 --> 2906.24]  We see this rope?
[2906.76 --> 2908.74]  This rope, it goes on forever.
[2908.96 --> 2909.34]  It doesn't.
[2909.44 --> 2910.08]  It ends behind a curtain,
[2910.12 --> 2911.28]  but it just goes on forever.
[2911.40 --> 2912.20]  Use your imagination.
[2912.36 --> 2914.94]  This rope, it extends, and it never ends,
[2914.96 --> 2915.96]  and it goes on forever.
[2916.68 --> 2918.52]  And this little taped part here
[2918.52 --> 2919.80]  is at the end of the rope.
[2919.90 --> 2923.92]  Now, this rope represents your existence.
[2924.90 --> 2926.82]  It represents your existence.
[2927.04 --> 2928.30]  So God created you,
[2928.64 --> 2931.82]  and now you exist forever, for eternity.
[2931.82 --> 2934.72]  This little taped part here, though,
[2934.78 --> 2935.78]  at the end of the rope,
[2936.02 --> 2937.78]  this is your existence on Earth.
[2938.46 --> 2939.48]  So you're born,
[2939.84 --> 2940.74]  and then you go to school,
[2941.24 --> 2942.38]  and you make some decisions,
[2942.86 --> 2944.10]  and who knows what you do.
[2944.14 --> 2945.04]  You get a job,
[2945.08 --> 2946.28]  and you buy that nice car,
[2946.38 --> 2947.24]  and then you retire,
[2947.44 --> 2949.30]  and then eventually you die,
[2950.00 --> 2951.34]  and then there's this.
[2952.20 --> 2953.28]  All of this.
[2954.42 --> 2956.52]  And Francis Chan's point in this illustration
[2956.52 --> 2959.68]  is we spend so much of our time
[2959.68 --> 2962.42]  on this Earth worried about this.
[2964.06 --> 2966.00]  And we don't think about this.
[2967.18 --> 2969.64]  We forget to think about the eternity
[2969.64 --> 2971.74]  that follows this.
[2972.80 --> 2974.56]  And I think that's what the question
[2974.56 --> 2975.68]  is getting at this morning.
[2975.84 --> 2978.76]  Why do we not talk about what this is?
[2978.94 --> 2979.74]  What is this?
[2979.86 --> 2980.58]  What is heaven?
[2980.72 --> 2981.48]  What is hell?
[2981.48 --> 2984.86]  And why do we spend so much time
[2984.86 --> 2985.76]  talking about this?
[2985.92 --> 2986.94]  So hold on to this.
[2987.04 --> 2987.90]  We'll come back to it.
[2989.26 --> 2991.34]  But let that sort of sink in your brains
[2991.34 --> 2992.30]  for a little bit.
[2995.10 --> 2996.86]  The first question we're going to get to first.
[2996.96 --> 2998.02]  Is hell real?
[2998.80 --> 2999.72]  Now this is a question
[2999.72 --> 3001.70]  that's captured the imagination
[3001.70 --> 3003.56]  of people honestly forever.
[3004.52 --> 3004.96]  However,
[3005.14 --> 3007.32]  what was once more of a black and white issue
[3007.32 --> 3008.28]  for a long time
[3008.28 --> 3010.20]  has definitely become more gray
[3010.20 --> 3013.44]  over the last decade or so.
[3013.98 --> 3015.54]  Especially out here in the West.
[3015.64 --> 3017.58]  And while I think that graying is problematic,
[3018.00 --> 3019.62]  it is nonetheless the case
[3019.62 --> 3021.02]  of where we live.
[3021.12 --> 3023.18]  Many Christians, in fact, right now
[3023.18 --> 3024.92]  are not as sure
[3024.92 --> 3026.72]  that hell is even a thing anymore.
[3027.20 --> 3028.38]  A documentary came out.
[3028.70 --> 3029.90]  It was called Hellbound.
[3030.00 --> 3031.28]  It came out in 2012.
[3032.08 --> 3033.90]  It should show up behind me on screen there.
[3034.12 --> 3036.16]  It explores this issue.
[3036.16 --> 3038.34]  It was actually filmed here in BC,
[3038.52 --> 3039.00]  believe it or not.
[3039.06 --> 3040.64]  So if you end up watching it,
[3040.68 --> 3042.56]  you'll see little pieces of Abbotsford in there.
[3043.30 --> 3044.22]  It became very popular.
[3044.32 --> 3045.40]  It even made it to the big screen.
[3046.20 --> 3047.72]  Hellbound, like all documentaries,
[3048.06 --> 3049.28]  it's a pretty biased one.
[3049.62 --> 3052.82]  But it explores three different views on hell
[3052.82 --> 3054.80]  that Christians have.
[3055.74 --> 3057.64]  These three views that they explore,
[3057.82 --> 3059.66]  one is called annihilationism,
[3059.96 --> 3061.46]  one is called universalism,
[3061.80 --> 3062.74]  and then a third one
[3062.74 --> 3064.64]  is the more traditional view of hell.
[3064.64 --> 3067.30]  So, we'll pick out all three of them real quick.
[3068.04 --> 3069.98]  Annihilationism gets the least screen time
[3069.98 --> 3070.84]  in this documentary
[3070.84 --> 3072.34]  because it's a view
[3072.34 --> 3074.02]  that just isn't held by very many people.
[3074.14 --> 3075.86]  But an annihilationist believes
[3075.86 --> 3076.92]  that if you believe in Jesus,
[3077.04 --> 3077.62]  you go to heaven.
[3078.34 --> 3079.56]  If you don't believe in Jesus,
[3080.10 --> 3081.16]  you just, you don't,
[3081.26 --> 3082.64]  you don't go to hell.
[3082.72 --> 3084.04]  You just sort of cease to be.
[3085.14 --> 3085.90]  So there's no hell.
[3085.98 --> 3087.10]  There's no eternal suffering.
[3087.80 --> 3089.00]  An annihilationist just believes
[3089.00 --> 3090.84]  you sort of just stop existing
[3090.84 --> 3091.96]  in body and soul.
[3092.06 --> 3093.18]  Like, poof, you're gone.
[3093.18 --> 3094.26]  You're annihilated.
[3094.82 --> 3095.18]  Annihilationism.
[3095.50 --> 3096.88]  That's all we're going to talk about that one
[3096.88 --> 3097.68]  because, like I said,
[3097.70 --> 3098.50]  it's not very popular,
[3098.62 --> 3099.54]  but it is one of the beliefs
[3099.54 --> 3100.72]  in Christian circles right now.
[3102.16 --> 3102.84]  Universalism is the one
[3102.84 --> 3103.74]  we're going to talk about
[3103.74 --> 3104.94]  a little bit longer.
[3105.84 --> 3107.20]  A universalist believes
[3107.20 --> 3109.36]  that heaven and hell are both real,
[3109.96 --> 3111.80]  but everyone goes to heaven.
[3113.10 --> 3114.08]  No one goes to hell.
[3115.20 --> 3116.88]  They believe that God's grace is so great
[3116.88 --> 3118.80]  that if you were an unbeliever when you die,
[3118.86 --> 3120.08]  you would instantly realize
[3120.08 --> 3121.88]  the terrible mistake you've made on this earth,
[3121.88 --> 3123.44]  and that God would be gracious
[3123.44 --> 3124.30]  in this afterlife,
[3125.08 --> 3126.02]  and you'd enter the kingdom
[3126.02 --> 3126.88]  of heaven forever.
[3127.06 --> 3128.50]  Rob Bell writes a book
[3128.50 --> 3129.80]  all about this.
[3129.90 --> 3130.86]  Very popular book.
[3130.96 --> 3131.94]  Again, I'm sure some of you
[3131.94 --> 3133.36]  have read it called Love Wins.
[3133.44 --> 3135.40]  It explores this thoroughly.
[3135.80 --> 3137.02]  So it talks about how
[3137.02 --> 3138.84]  his argument is that,
[3138.96 --> 3140.18]  again, God's grace is big enough
[3140.18 --> 3142.38]  that everybody goes to heaven.
[3143.12 --> 3144.18]  Hellbound, that documentary
[3144.18 --> 3144.96]  I mentioned as well,
[3144.98 --> 3146.52]  it is biased to this direction.
[3146.62 --> 3147.66]  That is the position,
[3147.78 --> 3149.44]  the posture that it sort of pushes.
[3149.44 --> 3151.72]  That makes sense.
[3151.84 --> 3152.46]  That makes sense
[3152.46 --> 3153.54]  that this book is being written.
[3153.70 --> 3154.22]  That makes sense
[3154.22 --> 3155.34]  that that documentary exists
[3155.34 --> 3156.36]  because that makes sense
[3156.36 --> 3157.38]  to our culture, doesn't it?
[3157.56 --> 3158.58]  This is an extremely
[3158.58 --> 3160.76]  attractive viewpoint, right?
[3161.12 --> 3162.24]  Everyone goes to heaven,
[3162.38 --> 3163.52]  no matter what they do,
[3163.58 --> 3165.06]  no matter what they believe on earth,
[3166.12 --> 3167.68]  especially out here in the West
[3167.68 --> 3169.40]  where we live in this
[3169.40 --> 3171.44]  extremely inclusive society,
[3171.54 --> 3172.50]  or so we say we do.
[3173.24 --> 3174.94]  We would be very attracted to this.
[3175.62 --> 3177.38]  Our culture is very attracted to this.
[3177.38 --> 3179.98]  It sure makes my rope illustration
[3179.98 --> 3181.42]  useless, though, doesn't it?
[3182.82 --> 3187.02]  Actually, it kind of makes life useless,
[3187.54 --> 3188.48]  doesn't it?
[3189.42 --> 3192.06]  Or God's missional calling
[3192.06 --> 3193.50]  on our lives to go out
[3193.50 --> 3194.76]  and make disciples.
[3194.86 --> 3195.72]  What's the point?
[3197.12 --> 3197.96]  Actually, it has a really
[3197.96 --> 3200.54]  what's-the-point vibe everywhere
[3200.54 --> 3201.68]  when you think about it, right?
[3202.32 --> 3203.38]  It's universalism.
[3203.38 --> 3205.84]  And thirdly,
[3206.14 --> 3208.28]  there's the traditional view of hell.
[3209.02 --> 3209.74]  And that's simply
[3209.74 --> 3211.14]  the viewpoint
[3211.14 --> 3212.44]  that if you believe in Jesus
[3212.44 --> 3213.80]  as the author of your salvation
[3213.80 --> 3214.52]  and you accept
[3214.52 --> 3215.84]  his free gift of grace,
[3216.22 --> 3217.42]  you go to heaven.
[3218.26 --> 3219.80]  And if you reject that truth,
[3219.88 --> 3220.76]  you go to hell.
[3222.44 --> 3223.40]  That is not that fun.
[3223.80 --> 3224.70]  That is not as fun
[3224.70 --> 3225.50]  as universalism.
[3226.30 --> 3227.90]  It does not seem very inclusive.
[3227.90 --> 3231.84]  But I want to ask you today,
[3231.88 --> 3233.34]  and I am posing this question for real.
[3233.50 --> 3235.22]  I am not trying to be patronizing with this,
[3235.58 --> 3236.66]  but if we read the text
[3236.66 --> 3237.44]  that we read today,
[3237.52 --> 3238.44]  the sheep and the goats,
[3239.38 --> 3240.70]  or if we read any of the other
[3240.70 --> 3241.76]  dozen or so times
[3241.76 --> 3243.30]  that Jesus speaks of heaven and hell
[3243.30 --> 3244.22]  in his gospels,
[3244.78 --> 3247.22]  it's hard to think
[3247.22 --> 3248.16]  that the traditional view
[3248.16 --> 3249.36]  of hell is wrong, isn't it?
[3249.36 --> 3252.96]  And maybe that makes us uncomfortable,
[3253.24 --> 3254.62]  or perhaps that makes us anxious,
[3255.26 --> 3257.56]  but just because we feel that way,
[3257.82 --> 3258.64]  it doesn't mean
[3258.64 --> 3261.56]  that we should just ignore it either,
[3261.64 --> 3263.88]  or come up with some new way of thinking.
[3264.68 --> 3264.92]  Right?
[3266.18 --> 3267.54]  Again, I pose this honestly.
[3268.10 --> 3268.82]  Francis Chan,
[3268.98 --> 3270.28]  turns out I'm a big fan of his today,
[3270.36 --> 3270.64]  apparently,
[3271.28 --> 3272.44]  he writes this book
[3272.44 --> 3273.98]  with a guy named Preston Sprinkle,
[3274.20 --> 3275.24]  which is a great name.
[3276.48 --> 3277.92]  It's called Erasing Hell.
[3278.38 --> 3279.18]  It's called Erasing Hell
[3279.18 --> 3280.80]  What God Said About Eternity
[3280.80 --> 3283.00]  and the Things We've Made Up.
[3284.18 --> 3284.78]  It's a good book.
[3284.88 --> 3286.08]  It's in response to
[3286.08 --> 3287.82]  the issue of universalism,
[3287.92 --> 3289.26]  and they say in this book
[3289.26 --> 3290.52]  that sometimes we don't want
[3290.52 --> 3291.18]  to believe in hell.
[3291.26 --> 3292.00]  It's a touchy subject.
[3292.10 --> 3292.94]  We don't want to go near it.
[3293.18 --> 3294.26]  But, and I quote them here,
[3294.66 --> 3297.30]  we cannot afford to be wrong
[3297.30 --> 3298.44]  about this issue.
[3301.14 --> 3302.24]  The truth is,
[3302.50 --> 3304.66]  when we read passages
[3304.66 --> 3305.60]  like ours today,
[3305.64 --> 3306.64]  it makes us uncomfortable
[3306.64 --> 3308.10]  that God is going to judge people
[3308.10 --> 3309.60]  at the end of their lives.
[3309.66 --> 3311.00]  The sheep going to heaven,
[3311.10 --> 3312.48]  the goats going to hell,
[3312.56 --> 3314.66]  but the reality is
[3314.66 --> 3316.50]  God is the judge of his creation.
[3318.78 --> 3320.02]  And if we give it some thought,
[3320.48 --> 3321.22]  that's okay.
[3321.72 --> 3322.56]  In fact, that's good.
[3324.00 --> 3324.88]  Peter Shackle says,
[3324.98 --> 3326.12]  the image of a judge
[3326.12 --> 3327.38]  imposing a sentence
[3327.38 --> 3328.26]  upon the guilty
[3328.26 --> 3330.82]  should vindicate God.
[3331.76 --> 3332.62]  Not the opposite.
[3332.62 --> 3335.34]  A judge in a courtroom is,
[3335.42 --> 3337.10]  or at least ought to always be,
[3337.66 --> 3339.34]  not a vindictive punisher,
[3339.84 --> 3341.60]  but one who weighs evidence
[3341.60 --> 3342.14]  objectively,
[3342.34 --> 3344.18]  reaches conclusions impartially,
[3344.18 --> 3346.36]  and imposes sentences
[3346.36 --> 3347.20]  equitably.
[3348.08 --> 3349.68]  The king in Jesus' parable
[3349.68 --> 3350.56]  is not a prosecutor
[3350.56 --> 3352.08]  accusing the defendants
[3352.08 --> 3353.56]  and building a case against them.
[3354.44 --> 3355.50]  The defendants
[3355.50 --> 3356.64]  have already been found guilty.
[3356.76 --> 3358.20]  Their deeds have been,
[3359.04 --> 3360.04]  or have condemned them.
[3360.04 --> 3363.76]  Their life has condemned them.
[3364.14 --> 3364.36]  God,
[3364.94 --> 3366.84]  God is the ultimate judge.
[3366.96 --> 3368.40]  We are not.
[3368.82 --> 3370.36]  We don't decide
[3370.36 --> 3371.36]  what heaven is,
[3371.42 --> 3372.52]  or what hell is,
[3372.58 --> 3373.94]  or who gets to go,
[3374.12 --> 3375.62]  or what people will be
[3375.62 --> 3376.24]  ending up doing
[3376.24 --> 3376.90]  in their eternity.
[3377.04 --> 3377.20]  No.
[3377.76 --> 3379.16]  God does.
[3380.14 --> 3381.12]  There's no use for us
[3381.12 --> 3382.14]  to design some sort of
[3382.14 --> 3382.98]  new rubric
[3382.98 --> 3383.88]  for judgment
[3383.88 --> 3384.66]  in a cosmos
[3384.66 --> 3385.28]  that honestly
[3385.28 --> 3386.50]  we barely understand,
[3386.60 --> 3387.46]  let alone function
[3387.46 --> 3388.38]  adequately in.
[3390.04 --> 3392.04]  He is the ultimate judge.
[3392.10 --> 3392.84]  He is the ultimate
[3392.84 --> 3394.70]  fair judge.
[3395.42 --> 3396.50]  It's His universe.
[3399.30 --> 3399.60]  So,
[3400.60 --> 3401.74]  hell is real,
[3402.30 --> 3403.28]  and heaven is real,
[3403.40 --> 3405.34]  but what are they exactly?
[3405.56 --> 3406.34]  Question number two.
[3406.98 --> 3408.60]  What is hell?
[3409.36 --> 3410.36]  Great question.
[3410.82 --> 3411.96]  Borderline unanswerable.
[3412.08 --> 3412.66]  But let's try.
[3413.58 --> 3414.16]  Like I said,
[3414.24 --> 3415.94]  Jesus does speak of hell
[3415.94 --> 3417.46]  quite a bit in the Gospels.
[3417.46 --> 3417.66]  So,
[3418.02 --> 3418.72]  take for example
[3418.72 --> 3419.46]  Matthew 11,
[3419.58 --> 3420.46]  23 to 24.
[3420.58 --> 3421.32]  I didn't slap that up
[3421.32 --> 3422.12]  on the screen behind me,
[3422.18 --> 3422.90]  so you're going to have to look
[3422.90 --> 3424.02]  at your own Bibles for this one.
[3424.58 --> 3424.84]  Jesus,
[3424.96 --> 3426.24]  He's speaking about towns
[3426.24 --> 3427.22]  and people who have seen
[3427.22 --> 3427.84]  and heard Him
[3427.84 --> 3429.28]  and heard the message,
[3429.40 --> 3430.22]  the Gospel message,
[3430.56 --> 3432.24]  but they are unrepentant
[3432.24 --> 3432.70]  and they're stuck
[3432.70 --> 3433.74]  in their wickedness
[3433.74 --> 3434.94]  and they choose sin over Him.
[3435.18 --> 3436.00]  And Jesus says
[3436.00 --> 3437.02]  in Matthew 11,
[3437.10 --> 3438.08]  23 to 24,
[3438.52 --> 3439.64]  to the city of Capernaum,
[3439.68 --> 3440.58]  which is not a good city,
[3440.96 --> 3441.32]  and you,
[3441.42 --> 3441.90]  Capernaum,
[3442.60 --> 3442.90]  you,
[3443.10 --> 3444.08]  or will you be lifted
[3444.08 --> 3444.66]  to the heavens?
[3445.56 --> 3445.90]  No,
[3446.70 --> 3447.76]  you will go down
[3447.76 --> 3448.42]  to Hades.
[3449.84 --> 3450.78]  For if the miracles
[3450.78 --> 3451.58]  that were performed
[3451.58 --> 3452.16]  in you
[3452.16 --> 3452.82]  had been performed
[3452.82 --> 3453.44]  in Sodom,
[3453.56 --> 3454.24]  if you remember Sodom
[3454.24 --> 3454.72]  and Gomorrah
[3454.72 --> 3455.38]  in the Old Testament,
[3456.00 --> 3456.84]  Sodom would have remained
[3456.84 --> 3457.48]  to this day.
[3458.36 --> 3459.04]  But I tell you
[3459.04 --> 3459.52]  that it would be
[3459.52 --> 3460.76]  more bearable for Sodom
[3460.76 --> 3461.60]  on the day of judgment
[3461.60 --> 3462.22]  than for you.
[3463.56 --> 3464.48]  You would go down
[3464.48 --> 3464.96]  to Hades.
[3465.08 --> 3465.92]  We read the word Hades
[3465.92 --> 3466.62]  in our Bibles,
[3466.92 --> 3467.32]  but in Greek,
[3467.44 --> 3468.60]  Jesus uses the word
[3468.60 --> 3470.02]  Gehenna here.
[3471.04 --> 3471.28]  Now,
[3471.30 --> 3472.52]  this is not the only place
[3472.52 --> 3473.64]  that Jesus speaks of hell.
[3473.70 --> 3474.28]  He speaks of hell
[3474.28 --> 3475.12]  throughout the Gospels,
[3475.28 --> 3476.40]  like Mark 9,
[3476.52 --> 3477.46]  43 to 48,
[3477.74 --> 3478.62]  or Luke 10,
[3478.82 --> 3479.76]  12 to 15,
[3479.84 --> 3480.74]  or John 15,
[3481.08 --> 3481.54]  verse 6,
[3481.58 --> 3482.38]  and over half a dozen
[3482.38 --> 3483.44]  other times.
[3483.96 --> 3485.86]  And Jesus often uses
[3485.86 --> 3487.40]  the word Gehenna
[3487.40 --> 3489.60]  to describe hell.
[3491.06 --> 3491.32]  Now,
[3491.36 --> 3491.92]  what's interesting
[3491.92 --> 3492.64]  is Gehenna
[3492.64 --> 3493.64]  is an actual place.
[3493.72 --> 3494.32]  It is a real,
[3494.58 --> 3495.50]  physical place,
[3495.54 --> 3496.24]  and it's a reference
[3496.24 --> 3497.02]  that not only
[3497.02 --> 3498.08]  would have Jesus' readers
[3498.08 --> 3498.48]  under,
[3498.56 --> 3499.12]  or a listener,
[3499.26 --> 3499.42]  sorry,
[3499.54 --> 3500.00]  understood,
[3500.56 --> 3501.24]  but a lot of them
[3501.24 --> 3501.96]  probably would have
[3501.96 --> 3502.68]  been there before.
[3503.84 --> 3505.20]  Gehenna is this valley
[3505.20 --> 3507.64]  where ancient and evil
[3507.64 --> 3508.86]  Old Testament kings
[3508.86 --> 3510.42]  sacrificed babies
[3510.42 --> 3511.38]  to false gods.
[3513.00 --> 3513.84]  In the Old Testament,
[3513.96 --> 3515.02]  the good king Josiah
[3515.02 --> 3516.14]  eventually outlawed
[3516.14 --> 3517.22]  child sacrifice,
[3517.40 --> 3518.14]  which, you know,
[3518.22 --> 3519.08]  good for him.
[3520.30 --> 3521.76]  But the physical valley
[3521.76 --> 3522.46]  where all of these
[3522.46 --> 3524.22]  horrific acts took place,
[3524.30 --> 3525.20]  they still existed
[3525.20 --> 3526.14]  in Jesus' day.
[3526.64 --> 3527.66]  It had actually become
[3527.66 --> 3528.36]  a dump.
[3529.58 --> 3530.40]  The Gehenna Valley
[3530.40 --> 3531.28]  turned into a dump
[3531.28 --> 3533.46]  where people burned garbage
[3533.46 --> 3534.54]  and the dead animals
[3534.54 --> 3536.00]  that died in their flocks.
[3536.08 --> 3537.78]  It was always smoking
[3537.78 --> 3538.76]  and on fire
[3538.76 --> 3540.10]  and just reeked
[3540.10 --> 3540.94]  of hot garbage
[3540.94 --> 3542.10]  and smoldering death.
[3542.56 --> 3543.82]  That's what Gehenna was.
[3544.72 --> 3545.84]  A smoldering pit
[3545.84 --> 3546.92]  of decay
[3546.92 --> 3548.18]  and repugnancies.
[3548.92 --> 3549.40]  And that
[3549.40 --> 3550.68]  was the image
[3550.68 --> 3551.82]  that Jesus went to
[3551.82 --> 3552.88]  time and time again
[3552.88 --> 3553.82]  when he spoke of hell.
[3553.82 --> 3557.26]  Now, I don't think
[3557.26 --> 3557.76]  it's a secret
[3557.76 --> 3558.74]  that Jesus is using
[3558.74 --> 3560.02]  Gehenna symbolically here.
[3560.08 --> 3560.50]  If you die,
[3560.56 --> 3561.14]  you don't end up
[3561.14 --> 3562.92]  going to this dump.
[3563.50 --> 3564.84]  But when he references hell,
[3564.92 --> 3566.30]  he uses it to symbolize
[3566.30 --> 3567.16]  what hell is,
[3567.20 --> 3568.00]  which makes sense.
[3568.08 --> 3569.52]  However, by using symbols,
[3569.66 --> 3570.94]  what that doesn't do for us
[3570.94 --> 3572.36]  is paint this beautiful
[3572.36 --> 3573.12]  literal picture
[3573.12 --> 3573.80]  of what hell
[3573.80 --> 3574.70]  actually looks like.
[3575.18 --> 3576.72]  So we often think of hell
[3576.72 --> 3577.70]  as lakes of fire
[3577.70 --> 3578.48]  and brimstone,
[3578.60 --> 3579.64]  but many have taken
[3579.64 --> 3580.88]  a very creative approach
[3580.88 --> 3582.36]  to what hell could be.
[3582.36 --> 3584.78]  Perhaps none are more famous
[3584.78 --> 3586.50]  than Dante's interpretation.
[3587.42 --> 3589.06]  Anybody heard Dante's Inferno?
[3589.20 --> 3589.66]  Hands up.
[3589.94 --> 3590.88]  Is that a popular thing?
[3591.24 --> 3592.26]  Four people only?
[3592.70 --> 3593.02]  Really?
[3593.30 --> 3594.32]  I don't believe it.
[3594.84 --> 3595.64]  People are not
[3595.64 --> 3596.80]  raising their hands.
[3597.20 --> 3597.80]  It's this big,
[3597.96 --> 3598.80]  giant poem,
[3598.94 --> 3599.86]  Dante's Inferno.
[3599.94 --> 3601.02]  There's a movie based on it.
[3601.06 --> 3601.88]  There's a video game
[3601.88 --> 3602.44]  based on it.
[3602.52 --> 3603.40]  There's paintings
[3603.40 --> 3604.24]  and literature.
[3604.64 --> 3605.28]  Very popular.
[3605.40 --> 3606.00]  In his poem,
[3606.74 --> 3607.58]  hell is depicted
[3607.58 --> 3609.40]  as nine concentric
[3609.40 --> 3610.56]  circles of torment
[3610.56 --> 3611.88]  located within the earth.
[3611.88 --> 3613.48]  And as you spiral down,
[3613.96 --> 3615.22]  the sins of humanity
[3615.22 --> 3615.84]  are worse
[3615.84 --> 3616.40]  and therefore
[3616.40 --> 3617.18]  the punishments
[3617.18 --> 3617.74]  are worse.
[3618.20 --> 3618.58]  And so,
[3618.78 --> 3620.20]  there's violent storms
[3620.20 --> 3621.10]  in the second ring
[3621.10 --> 3622.16]  for those kind of sinners
[3622.16 --> 3622.88]  but not so bad.
[3622.94 --> 3624.20]  There's storms there for them.
[3624.54 --> 3625.34]  Rivers of fire
[3625.34 --> 3625.88]  in the fifth.
[3625.96 --> 3626.52]  Now we're talking
[3626.52 --> 3627.32]  about real torture.
[3628.12 --> 3629.16]  Flaming tombs
[3629.16 --> 3630.10]  in the sixth rings.
[3630.20 --> 3630.70]  We're going down
[3630.70 --> 3631.16]  even further.
[3631.28 --> 3632.18]  And in the bottom level,
[3632.52 --> 3633.96]  the ninth circle of hell,
[3634.30 --> 3635.60]  there are frozen lakes
[3635.60 --> 3636.26]  of ice
[3636.26 --> 3637.44]  which people are stuck in
[3637.44 --> 3638.66]  for the rest of time.
[3639.20 --> 3640.58]  That is Dante's take
[3640.58 --> 3641.10]  on hell.
[3641.40 --> 3641.88]  Others view it
[3641.88 --> 3642.40]  quite differently.
[3643.46 --> 3645.26]  Rabbi Haim told a parable
[3645.26 --> 3646.48]  saying that all inhabitants
[3646.48 --> 3648.32]  of hell are given access
[3648.32 --> 3649.06]  to good food.
[3649.86 --> 3650.94]  But the utensils
[3650.94 --> 3651.64]  that they are given
[3651.64 --> 3652.72]  are far too long
[3652.72 --> 3653.44]  and unwieldy
[3653.44 --> 3654.54]  to serve oneself with.
[3654.62 --> 3655.60]  You can't get the food
[3655.60 --> 3656.18]  in your mouth.
[3656.74 --> 3657.64]  But rather than help
[3657.64 --> 3658.56]  each other out in hell,
[3658.62 --> 3659.86]  we're all selfish down there,
[3659.86 --> 3661.12]  you just struggle
[3661.12 --> 3662.60]  with this long spoon
[3662.60 --> 3663.90]  and never get to enjoy
[3663.90 --> 3665.20]  the sustenance down there
[3665.20 --> 3667.46]  and you constantly starve.
[3669.26 --> 3669.80]  C.S. Lewis,
[3669.94 --> 3670.28]  in his book
[3670.28 --> 3670.98]  The Great Divorce,
[3671.00 --> 3671.64]  he paints a picture
[3671.64 --> 3672.26]  of what he thinks
[3672.26 --> 3672.78]  hell is like.
[3673.12 --> 3673.94]  He imagines hell
[3673.94 --> 3675.00]  as this gray city
[3675.00 --> 3676.98]  where it's always rainy.
[3677.48 --> 3678.48]  It's always gloomy.
[3678.56 --> 3679.54]  The streets are empty.
[3680.08 --> 3680.64]  They're lined
[3680.64 --> 3682.00]  with dingy houses,
[3682.38 --> 3683.76]  small tobacco shops,
[3683.92 --> 3685.06]  windowless warehouses.
[3685.82 --> 3686.98]  The citizens of hell,
[3687.12 --> 3688.00]  they're quarrelsome.
[3688.12 --> 3689.32]  They fight all the time.
[3689.38 --> 3689.78]  And the streets
[3689.78 --> 3690.76]  actually are quite empty
[3690.76 --> 3691.82]  because the residents
[3691.82 --> 3692.66]  keep moving further
[3692.66 --> 3693.32]  and further away
[3693.32 --> 3693.82]  from each other
[3693.82 --> 3694.48]  because they can't
[3694.48 --> 3694.94]  stop fighting.
[3695.20 --> 3697.04]  Interestingly,
[3697.30 --> 3698.80]  C.S. Lewis thinks
[3698.80 --> 3699.52]  the residents of hell,
[3699.56 --> 3700.62]  they can construct a house
[3700.62 --> 3702.86]  or even various commodities
[3702.86 --> 3703.96]  just by thinking of them,
[3704.20 --> 3705.08]  which I find fascinating.
[3705.22 --> 3706.60]  But the houses
[3706.60 --> 3707.44]  that they think up
[3707.44 --> 3709.00]  and the sustenance
[3709.00 --> 3710.50]  that they think of
[3710.50 --> 3711.00]  aren't good.
[3711.24 --> 3712.24]  The houses they think up
[3712.24 --> 3713.46]  don't keep out the rain
[3713.46 --> 3714.20]  or the intruders
[3714.20 --> 3714.88]  and the sustenance
[3714.88 --> 3715.76]  they think up is gross
[3715.76 --> 3716.96]  and it doesn't satisfy anything.
[3717.50 --> 3718.30]  It's a tiny town.
[3718.82 --> 3719.56]  There's nothing to do.
[3720.38 --> 3721.20]  There's nothing to see.
[3723.92 --> 3725.06]  Three different pictures
[3725.06 --> 3725.42]  of hell.
[3725.42 --> 3726.62]  Who knows?
[3727.42 --> 3728.48]  But the truth is,
[3728.54 --> 3729.32]  what hell looks like
[3729.32 --> 3730.14]  is anyone's guess.
[3730.22 --> 3731.24]  But what we do know
[3731.24 --> 3732.88]  about hell
[3732.88 --> 3733.60]  is that God
[3733.60 --> 3735.40]  is not there.
[3737.40 --> 3739.22]  And if God is not there,
[3740.38 --> 3740.76]  hope
[3740.76 --> 3742.36]  is lost.
[3743.50 --> 3744.84]  Love does not exist.
[3746.44 --> 3747.60]  Selfishness would reign.
[3747.60 --> 3750.64]  And that in and of itself
[3750.64 --> 3752.10]  is torturous enough.
[3753.24 --> 3754.60]  It's a smoldering pit
[3754.60 --> 3755.36]  of decay
[3755.36 --> 3757.24]  and repugnancies.
[3758.52 --> 3759.02]  So whether hell
[3759.02 --> 3760.02]  is a sea of sulfur
[3760.02 --> 3762.36]  or spirals of torture
[3762.36 --> 3763.36]  or a kitchen
[3763.36 --> 3763.96]  with spoons
[3763.96 --> 3764.72]  that are too big
[3764.72 --> 3766.76]  or a long,
[3767.14 --> 3767.96]  tiny,
[3768.44 --> 3768.78]  gloomy,
[3768.96 --> 3769.56]  gray town,
[3770.96 --> 3772.38]  hell has no God.
[3772.84 --> 3773.88]  And without God,
[3774.54 --> 3775.98]  you don't want to be there.
[3775.98 --> 3778.94]  Let's switch.
[3779.06 --> 3779.80]  Let's switch gears.
[3779.90 --> 3780.30]  What's heaven?
[3780.46 --> 3781.26]  What's heaven then?
[3781.52 --> 3782.26]  Let's talk about
[3782.26 --> 3782.88]  something nice.
[3783.54 --> 3784.42]  The Bible paints
[3784.42 --> 3785.46]  some awesome pictures
[3785.46 --> 3786.14]  of heaven
[3786.14 --> 3787.64]  in the book of Revelation.
[3788.64 --> 3789.08]  Again,
[3789.14 --> 3790.06]  there's some symbolism here,
[3790.12 --> 3791.08]  but listen to the words
[3791.08 --> 3792.50]  of Revelation 21,
[3792.76 --> 3793.90]  verses 1 to 5.
[3794.14 --> 3794.70]  And I think that's
[3794.70 --> 3795.20]  behind me there.
[3795.24 --> 3795.70]  Yes, perfect.
[3795.70 --> 3796.88]  It says,
[3796.88 --> 3798.40]  Then I saw a new heaven
[3798.40 --> 3799.28]  and a new earth,
[3799.40 --> 3800.22]  for the first heaven
[3800.22 --> 3801.42]  and the first earth
[3801.42 --> 3802.26]  had passed away,
[3802.58 --> 3803.64]  and there was no longer
[3803.64 --> 3804.22]  any sea.
[3805.00 --> 3806.20]  I saw the holy city,
[3806.60 --> 3807.46]  the new Jerusalem,
[3807.66 --> 3809.02]  coming down out of heaven
[3809.02 --> 3809.70]  from God,
[3810.24 --> 3811.46]  prepared as a bride,
[3812.22 --> 3812.98]  beautifully dressed
[3812.98 --> 3813.60]  for her husband.
[3814.44 --> 3815.52]  And I heard a loud voice
[3815.52 --> 3816.26]  from the throne saying,
[3816.34 --> 3816.52]  Look,
[3816.98 --> 3818.02]  God's dwelling place
[3818.02 --> 3819.20]  is now among the people,
[3819.24 --> 3820.46]  and he will dwell with them.
[3820.68 --> 3821.78]  They will be his people,
[3821.86 --> 3822.62]  and God himself
[3822.62 --> 3823.40]  will be with them
[3823.40 --> 3824.60]  and be their God.
[3824.60 --> 3826.66]  He will wipe every tear
[3826.66 --> 3827.52]  from their eyes.
[3827.86 --> 3828.96]  There will be no more death
[3828.96 --> 3829.74]  or mourning
[3829.74 --> 3831.40]  or crying or pain,
[3831.78 --> 3833.02]  for the old order
[3833.02 --> 3834.14]  of things has passed.
[3835.32 --> 3835.94]  He who was seated
[3835.94 --> 3836.72]  on the throne said,
[3836.82 --> 3838.24]  I am making everything new.
[3838.78 --> 3839.16]  And then he said,
[3839.22 --> 3839.88]  Write this down,
[3839.96 --> 3841.08]  for these words
[3841.08 --> 3843.34]  are trustworthy and true.
[3844.08 --> 3845.32]  If you go one chapter further,
[3845.40 --> 3846.44]  read the first five verses
[3846.44 --> 3847.52]  of Revelation 22.
[3847.94 --> 3849.60]  It continues and says,
[3849.66 --> 3850.78]  The angel showed me,
[3850.86 --> 3851.88]  this is the writer John,
[3852.46 --> 3853.82]  the angel showed me
[3853.82 --> 3855.68]  the river of water of life,
[3855.88 --> 3857.24]  as clear as crystal,
[3857.38 --> 3859.00]  flowing from the throne of God,
[3859.16 --> 3860.78]  and of the lamb down the middle
[3860.78 --> 3862.36]  of the great street of the city.
[3862.66 --> 3863.98]  On each side of the river
[3863.98 --> 3865.34]  stood the tree of life,
[3865.86 --> 3867.62]  bearing twelve crops of fruit,
[3867.74 --> 3869.34]  yielding its fruit every month.
[3869.70 --> 3870.92]  And the leaves of the tree
[3870.92 --> 3872.46]  are for the healing of the nations.
[3872.72 --> 3874.58]  No longer will there be any curse.
[3875.14 --> 3876.14]  The throne of God
[3876.14 --> 3877.72]  and of the lamb
[3877.72 --> 3878.68]  will be in the city,
[3878.82 --> 3880.26]  and his servants will serve him.
[3880.26 --> 3881.40]  They will see his face,
[3881.48 --> 3882.48]  and his name will be
[3882.48 --> 3883.42]  on their foreheads.
[3883.72 --> 3885.04]  There will be no more night.
[3885.82 --> 3886.78]  They will not need
[3886.78 --> 3888.02]  the light of a lamp
[3888.02 --> 3889.04]  or the light of the sun,
[3889.10 --> 3889.92]  for the Lord God
[3889.92 --> 3890.74]  will give them light,
[3890.90 --> 3891.66]  and they will reign
[3891.66 --> 3893.54]  forever and ever.
[3895.22 --> 3896.56]  When I read these examples,
[3896.64 --> 3897.34]  this is what I read.
[3898.54 --> 3899.78]  Heaven is a beautiful city,
[3900.28 --> 3901.36]  surrounded by rivers
[3901.36 --> 3902.80]  and trees and gardens.
[3903.12 --> 3904.98]  We will dwell with God there.
[3905.78 --> 3906.96]  There will be no more sadness,
[3906.96 --> 3908.06]  no more grief,
[3908.50 --> 3909.88]  no more anxiety,
[3910.44 --> 3911.08]  or depression,
[3911.50 --> 3912.20]  or illness,
[3912.44 --> 3914.02]  or pain of any kind.
[3915.16 --> 3915.96]  There will be life,
[3916.90 --> 3917.76]  not just human life,
[3917.84 --> 3918.80]  but life of all kinds,
[3918.94 --> 3920.66]  rivers as clear as crystal,
[3920.80 --> 3922.00]  trees thriving
[3922.00 --> 3922.82]  and more abundant
[3922.82 --> 3924.24]  than any we have ever seen.
[3924.48 --> 3926.08]  There will be food and drink
[3926.08 --> 3927.66]  and unending sustenance,
[3927.74 --> 3929.56]  no more hunger or thirst.
[3930.20 --> 3931.10]  All wounds,
[3931.80 --> 3932.84]  physical and emotional,
[3932.96 --> 3934.34]  will fully be healed,
[3934.34 --> 3936.28]  and no memory of pain
[3936.28 --> 3937.18]  will ever exist.
[3938.58 --> 3939.34]  We will be marked
[3939.34 --> 3940.28]  as God's children,
[3940.42 --> 3942.02]  children of a perfect Father,
[3942.14 --> 3944.68]  fully under His wonderful care.
[3944.78 --> 3946.24]  There will be no darkness,
[3946.90 --> 3947.84]  no temptation,
[3948.08 --> 3948.64]  no guilt,
[3948.82 --> 3949.62]  no shame,
[3950.12 --> 3951.28]  and no fear.
[3952.78 --> 3954.66]  Only love and fulfillment
[3954.66 --> 3956.74]  and peace and light.
[3957.48 --> 3959.18]  Isn't that amazing?
[3961.82 --> 3962.84]  Now, right now,
[3962.84 --> 3963.96]  when we die,
[3964.12 --> 3965.26]  our souls go to be
[3965.26 --> 3966.32]  with Jesus in heaven,
[3966.80 --> 3967.54]  which is amazing.
[3969.06 --> 3970.80]  But when Jesus comes again,
[3971.34 --> 3972.58]  at the end of time,
[3973.14 --> 3974.50]  that heaven will come down,
[3974.56 --> 3975.58]  and there will be a new heaven
[3975.58 --> 3976.46]  and a new earth,
[3976.70 --> 3978.22]  and our souls will join
[3978.22 --> 3979.36]  our bodies.
[3981.04 --> 3982.34]  And then we will dance
[3982.34 --> 3983.94]  and laugh and swim
[3983.94 --> 3985.28]  and play and rest
[3985.28 --> 3986.32]  and read and eat
[3986.32 --> 3987.34]  and drink and sing
[3987.34 --> 3989.24]  and pick a verb
[3989.24 --> 3990.08]  that you love doing.
[3990.08 --> 3992.80]  and we'll be fully able
[3992.80 --> 3994.08]  to enjoy the things
[3994.08 --> 3995.00]  of this earth
[3995.00 --> 3995.68]  that we love
[3995.68 --> 3997.34]  without needing to worry
[3997.34 --> 3998.48]  about the dark things
[3998.48 --> 3999.26]  in our life
[3999.26 --> 4001.14]  ever again.
[4007.36 --> 4008.64]  And we won't have to worry
[4008.64 --> 4009.00]  about them
[4009.00 --> 4009.74]  for all of eternity.
[4009.74 --> 4014.36]  All of this,
[4015.22 --> 4016.72]  according to the word of God,
[4017.20 --> 4017.96]  is trustworthy
[4017.96 --> 4019.34]  and true.
[4022.42 --> 4023.54]  So if heaven and hell
[4023.54 --> 4024.04]  are real,
[4024.46 --> 4025.18]  why don't we talk
[4025.18 --> 4026.04]  about them that often?
[4027.12 --> 4028.12]  Why don't we talk about them
[4028.12 --> 4028.68]  from the pulpit?
[4029.94 --> 4031.02]  This is another good question.
[4032.38 --> 4033.18]  It's also one that I
[4033.18 --> 4034.82]  think is relative,
[4035.02 --> 4035.90]  how often is often.
[4036.06 --> 4036.86]  I think it is mentioned,
[4037.02 --> 4038.62]  but perhaps we don't talk
[4038.62 --> 4039.28]  about it that often.
[4039.36 --> 4040.02]  And I think there are
[4040.02 --> 4040.70]  reasons why.
[4040.92 --> 4041.62]  I think there's actually
[4041.62 --> 4042.52]  two reasons why.
[4044.30 --> 4045.02]  Reason number one,
[4045.08 --> 4045.56]  for those of you
[4045.56 --> 4046.42]  who are sitting here
[4046.42 --> 4047.88]  or who are watching online,
[4049.12 --> 4050.40]  who have put their faith
[4050.40 --> 4051.20]  in Jesus Christ
[4051.20 --> 4051.94]  as their savior,
[4052.74 --> 4053.96]  the reason that we don't
[4053.96 --> 4055.22]  discuss heaven or hell
[4055.22 --> 4056.32]  all that often to you
[4056.32 --> 4057.78]  is because you're
[4057.78 --> 4058.74]  already saved.
[4059.94 --> 4060.62]  The truth is,
[4060.90 --> 4061.50]  while these things
[4061.50 --> 4062.08]  are maybe fun
[4062.08 --> 4062.92]  and interesting to discuss,
[4063.00 --> 4063.88]  if you put your faith
[4063.88 --> 4064.46]  in Jesus,
[4064.78 --> 4066.14]  your salvation from hell
[4066.14 --> 4067.36]  and a promised eternity
[4067.36 --> 4067.96]  with God
[4067.96 --> 4068.82]  is already
[4068.82 --> 4069.84]  a concrete reality
[4069.84 --> 4070.32]  for you.
[4070.86 --> 4071.46]  There's no need
[4071.46 --> 4072.28]  to discuss hell
[4072.28 --> 4073.10]  if you believe
[4073.10 --> 4073.78]  because hell isn't
[4073.78 --> 4074.76]  even within your grasp.
[4075.52 --> 4076.80]  Jesus has already
[4076.80 --> 4077.64]  saved the world.
[4078.44 --> 4079.20]  It's just not been
[4079.20 --> 4080.22]  fully revealed yet.
[4080.46 --> 4081.94]  It's already not yet.
[4082.36 --> 4083.72]  Jesus lived on this earth
[4083.72 --> 4084.80]  the sinless life
[4084.80 --> 4085.58]  that we have all
[4085.58 --> 4086.42]  failed to live.
[4086.62 --> 4087.34]  And then he died
[4087.34 --> 4088.34]  a death on the cross
[4088.34 --> 4089.98]  that we all deserve to die
[4089.98 --> 4092.56]  so that we wouldn't have to.
[4093.52 --> 4094.98]  He atoned for our sinfulness.
[4095.32 --> 4096.84]  He was raised from the dead
[4096.84 --> 4097.82]  and he has defeated
[4097.82 --> 4099.70]  sin and death forever.
[4099.70 --> 4100.72]  For you and I
[4100.72 --> 4101.70]  and all who believe
[4101.70 --> 4103.60]  this is the truth.
[4104.52 --> 4105.68]  So there's nothing
[4105.68 --> 4106.84]  for you to do
[4106.84 --> 4108.22]  to gain your salvation
[4108.22 --> 4109.42]  but believe that Christ
[4109.42 --> 4110.20]  has accomplished
[4110.20 --> 4110.88]  this already.
[4112.10 --> 4113.02]  Grace is yours.
[4113.16 --> 4114.66]  Forgiveness is yours.
[4115.44 --> 4116.84]  Eternity is yours.
[4117.14 --> 4118.12]  If you believe this
[4118.12 --> 4118.74]  to be true,
[4118.94 --> 4119.60]  there's no need
[4119.60 --> 4120.78]  to worry about hell
[4120.78 --> 4122.16]  because heaven
[4122.16 --> 4122.80]  is already
[4122.80 --> 4123.90]  the concrete reality
[4123.90 --> 4124.46]  for you.
[4125.26 --> 4126.52]  You're just not there yet.
[4128.16 --> 4129.32]  So that's the first one.
[4129.82 --> 4130.52]  Second answer,
[4130.62 --> 4131.74]  what about those
[4131.74 --> 4132.50]  who don't believe?
[4132.62 --> 4133.60]  Should we not be talking
[4133.60 --> 4134.46]  about this in church
[4134.46 --> 4135.30]  more for those
[4135.30 --> 4136.16]  who don't believe?
[4137.02 --> 4138.04]  Why don't we talk
[4138.04 --> 4138.78]  about this
[4138.78 --> 4140.40]  in our mission?
[4142.98 --> 4143.70]  If you're someone
[4143.70 --> 4144.46]  who doesn't believe
[4144.46 --> 4145.06]  here today
[4145.06 --> 4146.54]  or if you're watching online,
[4147.22 --> 4148.52]  should we not be bringing
[4148.52 --> 4149.34]  this truth to you?
[4149.34 --> 4151.38]  Why don't we talk
[4151.38 --> 4152.16]  about this for you?
[4154.36 --> 4155.16]  But if you're someone
[4155.16 --> 4156.18]  who doesn't believe,
[4156.98 --> 4158.16]  you don't need someone
[4158.16 --> 4158.86]  to talk to you
[4158.86 --> 4159.70]  about heaven and hell.
[4160.54 --> 4161.44]  You need someone
[4161.44 --> 4162.12]  to talk to you
[4162.12 --> 4162.76]  about Jesus.
[4165.98 --> 4166.90]  So some Christians,
[4167.02 --> 4167.44]  some churches,
[4167.60 --> 4168.20]  they use heaven
[4168.20 --> 4168.98]  and they use hell
[4168.98 --> 4169.54]  as their sort of
[4169.54 --> 4170.40]  missional platform.
[4170.72 --> 4172.08]  They love a good
[4172.08 --> 4173.56]  turn or burn sermon.
[4174.34 --> 4175.32]  You see it in the States
[4175.32 --> 4176.08]  quite a bit actually.
[4176.20 --> 4176.92]  It's creeping up here
[4176.92 --> 4178.08]  in Canada a little bit too
[4178.08 --> 4179.24]  but in the States
[4179.24 --> 4180.02]  you see it all the time.
[4180.10 --> 4180.84]  People on the corners
[4180.84 --> 4181.46]  of intersections
[4181.46 --> 4182.78]  with giant big signs
[4182.78 --> 4183.76]  and they've got their bullhorn
[4183.76 --> 4184.20]  and they're like,
[4184.44 --> 4185.68]  repent or die
[4185.68 --> 4186.46]  and they're just saying
[4186.46 --> 4187.34]  it to crowds of people.
[4188.40 --> 4189.56]  People use hell
[4189.56 --> 4191.72]  as a missional motivator.
[4193.30 --> 4194.16]  I just don't think
[4194.16 --> 4194.76]  that's helpful
[4194.76 --> 4195.66]  or effective
[4195.66 --> 4196.88]  but people do do it.
[4197.32 --> 4197.58]  Do do.
[4199.18 --> 4200.62]  The problem with that
[4200.62 --> 4203.44]  beyond the lack of tact
[4203.44 --> 4204.92]  because let's face it,
[4204.94 --> 4205.78]  that's pretty tactless
[4205.78 --> 4208.26]  is that using hell
[4208.26 --> 4209.44]  as a sin repellent
[4209.44 --> 4210.36]  or vice versa,
[4210.48 --> 4211.32]  using heaven
[4211.32 --> 4212.22]  as sort of a carrot
[4212.22 --> 4213.82]  to dangle in front of people
[4213.82 --> 4214.92]  to get them to repent,
[4215.62 --> 4216.78]  you're already guilty
[4216.78 --> 4218.36]  of becoming a morality gospel.
[4218.80 --> 4219.66]  And what I mean by that
[4219.66 --> 4220.54]  is by using heaven
[4220.54 --> 4221.34]  or hell
[4221.34 --> 4222.10]  as a means
[4222.10 --> 4223.52]  to convert to unbelievers
[4223.52 --> 4224.24]  becomes about
[4224.24 --> 4225.88]  what they must do
[4225.88 --> 4228.16]  to gain some salvation
[4228.16 --> 4229.56]  or to lose
[4229.56 --> 4231.42]  out in eternity.
[4231.42 --> 4234.24]  but this is not
[4234.24 --> 4235.62]  about what we must do,
[4235.74 --> 4236.96]  it's about a God
[4236.96 --> 4237.42]  who did.
[4239.90 --> 4241.00]  We need to be talking
[4241.00 --> 4242.10]  about what God did
[4242.10 --> 4242.74]  to save us.
[4242.86 --> 4243.60]  It's personal,
[4243.74 --> 4244.58]  not locational.
[4244.96 --> 4245.96]  We aren't moral
[4245.96 --> 4246.64]  because we're trying
[4246.64 --> 4247.38]  to be good enough
[4247.38 --> 4248.18]  to get into heaven
[4248.18 --> 4248.80]  and avoid hell.
[4248.86 --> 4250.10]  No, that's actually selfish.
[4250.38 --> 4251.76]  That's selfishly motivated.
[4252.14 --> 4252.78]  Your salvation
[4252.78 --> 4253.74]  is not determined
[4253.74 --> 4254.58]  by your actions,
[4254.78 --> 4255.48]  it's determined
[4255.48 --> 4256.18]  by Jesus.
[4258.18 --> 4259.04]  Your salvation
[4259.04 --> 4259.90]  has been granted
[4259.90 --> 4260.74]  to you by Christ,
[4260.82 --> 4261.18]  you just,
[4261.42 --> 4262.72]  you need to accept it.
[4264.00 --> 4264.86]  So our mission
[4264.86 --> 4265.38]  as a church
[4265.38 --> 4266.58]  is not to scare people
[4266.58 --> 4267.92]  into living moral lives
[4267.92 --> 4269.08]  because morality
[4269.08 --> 4270.38]  is not the determiner
[4270.38 --> 4271.08]  of your outcome.
[4271.46 --> 4272.46]  Jesus is.
[4273.88 --> 4275.66]  Morality is the response
[4275.66 --> 4277.04]  of a faith in Christ,
[4277.32 --> 4278.56]  a faith which saves,
[4278.64 --> 4279.54]  a faith which works.
[4279.60 --> 4280.20]  Remember James?
[4281.42 --> 4282.10]  Our mission
[4282.10 --> 4283.20]  is not to tell people
[4283.20 --> 4284.20]  about heaven and hell,
[4285.06 --> 4285.96]  it's to tell people
[4285.96 --> 4287.20]  of the one who saves.
[4287.46 --> 4287.86]  Our mission
[4287.86 --> 4289.14]  is to tell the stories
[4289.14 --> 4290.22]  of his saving grace
[4290.22 --> 4291.32]  in our lives,
[4291.42 --> 4292.16]  of the hope,
[4292.38 --> 4292.94]  the salvation,
[4293.10 --> 4293.42]  the love,
[4293.50 --> 4294.58]  the joy that we find
[4294.58 --> 4295.44]  in him.
[4297.18 --> 4298.40]  We don't need heaven
[4298.40 --> 4298.92]  or hell
[4298.92 --> 4300.66]  as real as they are
[4300.66 --> 4301.84]  as gimmicks
[4301.84 --> 4303.00]  to share this news.
[4303.46 --> 4304.60]  We just need
[4304.60 --> 4306.14]  the gospel of Christ
[4306.14 --> 4308.72]  and the Holy Spirit.
[4310.68 --> 4311.64]  Fear of hell
[4311.64 --> 4312.84]  just brings on anxiety
[4312.84 --> 4313.74]  and the promise of heaven
[4313.74 --> 4315.22]  might change a decision
[4315.22 --> 4315.92]  or two, sure,
[4315.92 --> 4317.60]  but the Holy Spirit
[4317.60 --> 4318.94]  changes lives.
[4319.40 --> 4320.48]  Jesus' gospel
[4320.48 --> 4322.22]  changes lives.
[4324.84 --> 4326.38]  Once Christ's gospel
[4326.38 --> 4327.24]  message of grace
[4327.24 --> 4327.94]  is understood
[4327.94 --> 4328.62]  and accepted,
[4329.00 --> 4330.84]  then faith abounds.
[4331.60 --> 4332.98]  And once faith abounds,
[4333.46 --> 4334.22]  then eternity
[4334.22 --> 4337.24]  with the triune God
[4337.24 --> 4338.52]  in eternal heaven
[4338.52 --> 4340.44]  becomes certain.
[4340.44 --> 4342.56]  And once heaven
[4342.56 --> 4343.44]  becomes certain,
[4343.86 --> 4344.64]  for those who believe,
[4344.70 --> 4345.48]  hell doesn't even need
[4345.48 --> 4346.36]  a whisper of thought.
[4348.52 --> 4349.66]  We don't need
[4349.66 --> 4350.58]  to think about heaven
[4350.58 --> 4351.32]  or hell that often
[4351.32 --> 4352.82]  because once we start
[4352.82 --> 4354.02]  using heaven and hell
[4354.02 --> 4354.90]  as a motivator
[4354.90 --> 4355.74]  for good behavior
[4355.74 --> 4356.68]  or an instrument
[4356.68 --> 4357.40]  for mission,
[4357.90 --> 4359.42]  we start missing
[4359.42 --> 4360.46]  the gospel truth
[4360.46 --> 4361.32]  found in Christ.
[4362.48 --> 4363.66]  So Francis Chan,
[4363.74 --> 4364.16]  he's right.
[4364.16 --> 4367.40]  what happens here
[4367.40 --> 4369.12]  affects this.
[4372.64 --> 4374.16]  But it's not what we do
[4374.16 --> 4375.26]  here that does.
[4376.72 --> 4378.28]  It's who we put our faith
[4378.28 --> 4379.44]  in here that does.
[4381.52 --> 4382.76]  So hell exists
[4382.76 --> 4383.88]  and so does heaven.
[4384.70 --> 4385.84]  But the truth behind
[4385.84 --> 4387.24]  all of that
[4387.24 --> 4388.56]  is that Jesus
[4388.56 --> 4390.20]  has already saved
[4390.20 --> 4390.66]  the world
[4390.66 --> 4391.64]  from the clutches of hell.
[4391.64 --> 4394.10]  and all who believed
[4394.10 --> 4395.02]  are saved.
[4396.20 --> 4397.12]  Do we believe that?
[4398.58 --> 4398.98]  Amen.
[4399.08 --> 4399.46]  Let me pray.
[4403.54 --> 4404.30]  Father God,
[4404.80 --> 4405.66]  heaven, hell,
[4406.86 --> 4408.62]  these things,
[4408.74 --> 4409.46]  these constructs
[4409.46 --> 4410.00]  are so hard
[4410.00 --> 4410.56]  for us to wrap
[4410.56 --> 4411.08]  our mind around.
[4411.18 --> 4412.18]  You've given us pictures,
[4412.36 --> 4412.44]  Lord.
[4412.48 --> 4413.32]  You've given us symbols
[4413.32 --> 4414.16]  which is wonderful
[4414.16 --> 4415.34]  but to understand
[4415.34 --> 4416.38]  truly what they are
[4416.38 --> 4417.94]  we cannot fully grasp.
[4418.90 --> 4419.26]  But Lord,
[4419.30 --> 4419.84]  what we do know
[4419.84 --> 4420.66]  is we want to be
[4420.66 --> 4421.58]  in eternity with you.
[4422.42 --> 4423.56]  And more than that,
[4423.64 --> 4423.82]  Lord,
[4423.96 --> 4424.96]  we know that you have
[4424.96 --> 4425.86]  come and saved us.
[4426.40 --> 4427.36]  We know that your son
[4427.36 --> 4428.16]  has died for us,
[4428.26 --> 4429.40]  that our sins are forgiven,
[4429.64 --> 4430.54]  that you are gracious
[4430.54 --> 4432.38]  and that we belong to you.
[4432.50 --> 4433.32]  And because of that,
[4433.38 --> 4433.52]  God,
[4433.54 --> 4435.48]  we are so eternally grateful.
[4436.58 --> 4438.04]  May our faith
[4438.04 --> 4439.38]  rest in that truth.
[4440.82 --> 4441.16]  And Lord,
[4441.20 --> 4442.98]  as we know what that means
[4442.98 --> 4443.64]  for eternity,
[4443.82 --> 4444.98]  may that not become
[4444.98 --> 4446.40]  something that causes us
[4446.40 --> 4448.18]  to think that there's things
[4448.18 --> 4449.00]  that we can do
[4449.00 --> 4449.68]  for this.
[4449.68 --> 4450.98]  but may we just simply
[4450.98 --> 4453.16]  submit to your will
[4453.16 --> 4453.96]  for our lives
[4453.96 --> 4455.04]  to love your Lord,
[4455.14 --> 4455.78]  to love you
[4455.78 --> 4456.72]  with all our hearts,
[4456.96 --> 4457.62]  to love our neighbor
[4457.62 --> 4458.42]  as ourselves.
[4458.54 --> 4459.68]  May selfishness disappear.
[4460.44 --> 4461.08]  May we live
[4461.08 --> 4462.22]  as you've called us to live
[4462.22 --> 4463.06]  and may we live
[4463.06 --> 4463.94]  knowing the promises
[4463.94 --> 4465.12]  that you have given for us
[4465.12 --> 4466.24]  are true in our lives
[4466.24 --> 4467.48]  and that you reign
[4467.48 --> 4468.52]  over us
[4468.52 --> 4469.58]  for all of eternity.
[4470.14 --> 4470.74]  Thank you, Lord.
[4470.78 --> 4471.52]  We pray in your name.
[4471.74 --> 4471.94]  Amen.
[4471.94 --> 4472.04]  Amen.
[4472.46 --> 4472.94]  Amen.
[4472.94 --> 4473.94]  Amen.
[4473.94 --> 4474.94]  Amen.
[4474.94 --> 4476.18]  Amen.
[4476.18 --> 4478.30]  Amen.
[4478.30 --> 4478.64]  Amen.
[4478.64 --> 4478.94]  Amen.
[4479.24 --> 4479.72]  Amen.
[4484.16 --> 4486.68]  Amen.
[4487.96 --> 4488.62]  Amen.
[4488.62 --> 4492.00]  Amen.
[4494.80 --> 4495.22]  Amen.
[4495.62 --> 4495.78]  Amen.
[4496.14 --> 4496.16]  Amen.
[4496.16 --> 4496.62]  Amen.
[4496.66 --> 4497.14]  Amen.
[4497.14 --> 4497.94]  Amen.
[4497.94 --> 4498.18]  Amen.
[4498.18 --> 4498.32]  Amen.
[4498.32 --> 4498.70]  Amen.
[4498.74 --> 4498.92]  Amen.
[4498.92 --> 4499.30]  Amen.
[4499.30 --> 4500.14]  Amen.
[4500.14 --> 4500.26]  Amen.
[4500.36 --> 4500.70]  Amen.
[4500.70 --> 4501.68]  Amen.
[4501.68 --> 4502.16]  Amen.
[4502.18 --> 4502.42]  Amen.
