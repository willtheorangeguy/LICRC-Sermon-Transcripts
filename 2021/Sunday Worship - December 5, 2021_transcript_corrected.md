[66.60 → 72.16] When I hear the rhythm of your name
[72.16 → 75.46] Oh, I remember once again
[75.46 → 81.64] That none of us will ache without a living hope
[84.48 → 103.20] Elizabeth, oh blessed is the one who has believed
[103.20 → 110.92] In the rising sun
[110.92 → 117.38] Who will guide our feet into the path of peace
[117.38 → 126.68] For we will live to see
[126.68 → 134.42] That joy comes in the morning
[134.42 → 139.88] Come and lay your hands
[139.88 → 145.88] On His promises
[145.88 → 150.56] Oh, find your rest
[150.56 → 156.76] Come and lay your hands
[156.76 → 163.22] On His promises

[205.84 → 215.84] In the bleak midwinter, all creation groans.
[215.84 → 225.50] And for a world in darkness, frozen like a stone, light is breaking.
[226.50 → 230.82] In a stable for a throne.
[230.82 → 238.82] And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore.
[238.82 → 246.82] And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore.
[246.82 → 254.82] Unto us a child is born, the King of kings and Lord of lords.
[254.82 → 262.82] And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore.
[262.82 → 270.82] And He shall reign forever, forevermore.
[270.82 → 278.82] And if I were a wise man, I would travel far.
[278.82 → 286.82] And if I were a shepherd, I would do my part.
[286.82 → 294.82] But poor as I am, I will give to Him my heart.
[294.82 → 302.82] And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore.
[302.82 → 310.82] And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore.
[310.82 → 320.82] And He shall reign forever, forevermore.
[320.82 → 326.82] And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore.
[326.82 → 330.82] He was made of major lies.
[330.82 → 333.82] The one who made the starry skies.
[333.82 → 337.82] This baby born for sacrifice.
[337.82 → 338.82] Christ the Messiah.
[338.82 → 339.82] Christ the Messiah.

[349.82 → 353.82] The promise of eternal years.
[353.82 → 357.82] Christ the Messiah.
[357.82 → 358.82] Christ the Messiah.

[473.22 → 481.22] He shall reign.
[481.22 → 487.22] And the soul found its worth.
[487.22 → 491.22] A thrill of hope.
[491.22 → 501.22] The weary world rejoices for yonder grace.
[501.22 → 505.22] A new and glorious morn.

[581.22 → 589.36] everyone. Welcome once again to church. My name is Chris. I'm one of the pastors here, and it's
[589.36 → 595.80] my privilege to lead you along with these others and a couple more yet in worship this morning.
[596.52 → 602.16] If you are joining us online, welcome to you. Thank you for clicking on that link and checking
[602.16 → 610.10] us out. We are piloting a new feature for our live stream this morning as we have embedded that to
[610.10 → 615.30] our new church website, and so there's a new place to experience that. And so if you have feedback and
[615.30 → 620.38] you're participating online, I'd love to hear it this week, and we can make that a better experience
[620.38 → 628.36] for everyone going forward. As I look out at you, I see that you have probably all heard about the new
[628.36 → 635.28] policy and mandates for worship gatherings here in BC, and so I just want to remind you that we are
[635.28 → 641.72] required to keep our masks on for the duration of the service unless you are up speaking and leading
[641.72 → 649.90] here. And, so please be intentional with that and be diligent in that together so that we can continue
[649.90 → 656.20] worshipping as a community this season. Before we begin, I have just a couple announcements.
[657.24 → 664.02] First, there is kids choir practice following worship this morning in the multipurpose room.
[664.02 → 673.02] And I was instructed to say it would be really helpful if at least one parent or guardian of the kids
[673.02 → 680.12] in the choir could hang out in that room to encourage obedient participation.
[684.52 → 689.74] And I say that as a parent who has kids in the choir and will probably have to be there himself
[689.74 → 698.04] following. So, 11 30-ish after service today. Also, later after service is youth coffee. If you haven't
[698.04 → 702.08] heard about that, and you're part of our youth program here, you can ask Pastor Kevin about questions,
[702.20 → 712.18] but that's happening this afternoon too. Also, the applications for the Mexico mission trip have been
[712.18 → 718.74] emailed out. That is a trip that is happening during spring break next year, Lord willing. And so the
[718.74 → 725.90] applications for that have been emailed out. The deadline for return is December 18 to Brandon Muller
[725.90 → 732.08] in his church mailbox, please. And so if you've received that application, you can talk to Brandon or Mike
[732.08 → 738.74] if you have questions about that and then return it to Brandon's church mailbox. Also, I wanted to stress
[738.74 → 745.54] and I was told to stress that while this event happens during spring break and sort of targets the youth
[745.54 → 751.74] in our church, anyone is invited to go. And so if you are not a youth but would like to participate in
[751.74 → 756.40] this trip, you are also invited to talk to Brandon or Mike and figure out the details for that.
[758.06 → 763.88] Finally, next week Sunday when we gather here or if you are participating online when you gather
[763.88 → 769.74] wherever you are, we will be celebrating Lord's Supper together. And so we want to tell you that a week early
[769.74 → 774.94] so that you have a chance to have the things ready, bread and juice or the like, so that you can
[774.94 → 780.88] participate at home. But also, and more importantly, so that you can spend this next week preparing your
[780.88 → 786.06] hearts, having the kinds of conversations you need with your brothers or sisters or with your kids,
[786.10 → 790.98] if you are parents, so that we can all come to the table meaningfully together. If you have any
[790.98 → 796.18] questions about that process or experience, you can grab me or connect with me throughout the week as well.
[796.18 → 801.46] So, begin our worship. We're going to continue with the candle lighting service. And so I'm going to ask
[801.46 → 806.06] if Judy and Encke come to the front and lead us in that.
[826.18 → 853.04] C. God is lighting. God is sending God's messenger to prepare the way.
[853.04 → 858.98] C. God is lighting. The one whom we seek is indeed coming.
[862.98 → 865.46] We wait for the one who refines us.
[868.40 → 871.04] We wait for the one who purifies us.
[874.28 → 877.94] The Lord's purifying fire burns with love for us.
[877.94 → 886.74] The Lord's cleansing soap washes us in his love.
[893.46 → 900.12] We light the love candle this week because as we wait for the Lord's coming, we remember that Christ
[900.12 → 905.58] has already demonstrated his great love for us so that we can be refined by his righteousness.
[905.58 → 915.46] When we see the love candle shining, we remember that our waiting is not empty, but must be filled with love for others.
[915.94 → 919.62] For as Christ loves us, so we must love each other.
[921.52 → 929.62] We pray, God of love, may your spirit spur us to actions of love during this period of waiting.
[929.62 → 935.50] Jesus, the Son, has shown us what true love requires.
[937.82 → 941.38] Submission, sacrifice, and sanctification.
[942.26 → 948.64] May we emulate his ways so that the world may know of your great love.
[949.28 → 951.48] In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[951.48 → 951.56] Amen.
[951.56 → 951.58] Amen.
[951.58 → 951.60] Amen.
[959.62 → 971.30] As you are able and where you are, I'm going to invite you to stand and take a posture of a seat as God welcomes us into his presence to worship him.
[974.42 → 983.20] This Sunday morning, grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Saviour,
[983.58 → 986.22] through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[986.90 → 989.34] All God's people said, Amen.
[989.62 → 994.62] Amen.
[994.62 → 994.88] Amen.
[995.52 → 996.56] Amen.
[996.56 → 996.78] Amen.
[996.78 → 997.92] Amen.
[1006.48 → 1010.88] Amen.
[1010.88 → 1011.16] Amen.
[1011.16 → 1020.68] Oh, the star to a place unexpected
[1020.68 → 1025.56] Fruity in the name of the rolling projectors
[1025.56 → 1027.80] Brought in a manger
[1027.80 → 1034.52] Lowly and small, the weakens of all
[1034.52 → 1036.94] The fitliest hero
[1036.94 → 1041.60] Brought in his mother's shoulders to shine
[1041.60 → 1045.68] Is this who we've waited for?
[1048.86 → 1053.60] Because how many kings stepped out from their clothes?
[1053.60 → 1058.28] How many lords have abandoned their homes?
[1058.70 → 1063.88] How many greats have become the least for me?
[1063.88 → 1072.28] How many ghosts have poured out their hearts
[1072.28 → 1076.66] To romance a world that is torn all apart?
[1076.66 → 1083.62] How many fathers gave up their sons for me?
[1083.62 → 1091.02] Bringing our gifts for the newborn Saviour
[1091.02 → 1095.48] All that we have, whether costly or meek
[1095.48 → 1098.62] Because we believe
[1098.62 → 1106.28] Gold for his honour and frankincense for his pleasure
[1106.28 → 1109.94] And burn for the cross, and he'll suffer
[1109.94 → 1112.10] Do you believe
[1112.10 → 1116.12] Is this who we've waited for?
[1118.78 → 1123.78] How many kings stepped down from their thrones?
[1124.20 → 1128.48] How many lords have abandoned their homes?
[1128.48 → 1134.30] How many greats have become the least for me?
[1134.30 → 1142.58] How many gods have poured out their hearts?
[1142.58 → 1147.08] Romance a world that is torn all apart
[1147.08 → 1153.12] How many fathers gave up their sons for me?
[1153.12 → 1158.94] Only one did that for me?
[1158.94 → 1159.94] Only one did that for me
[1159.94 → 1170.80] How many kings stepped down from their thrones?
[1170.80 → 1175.44] How many lords have abandoned their homes?
[1175.44 → 1179.92] How many greats have become the least?
[1179.92 → 1184.74] How many gods have poured out their hearts?
[1184.74 → 1185.74] How many gods have poured out their hearts?
[1185.74 → 1188.74] To romance a world that is torn all apart?
[1188.74 → 1194.74] How many fathers gave up their sons for me?
[1194.74 → 1199.74] Only one did that for me
[1199.74 → 1201.74] How many fathers gave up their sons for me?
[1201.74 → 1203.74] Only one did that for me
[1203.74 → 1211.56] All creation
[1211.56 → 1216.56] apian rock
[1216.56 → 1222.56] Subtitling 153
[1222.56 → 1235.92] All creation, all the earth
[1235.92 → 1240.30] Make straight a life for the Lord
[1240.30 → 1246.56] Jesus is coming soon
[1246.56 → 1253.92] Pull back the sin, wake up the saints
[1253.92 → 1258.70] Let every nation shout at your name
[1258.70 → 1265.76] Jesus is coming soon
[1265.76 → 1273.16] Like a ride waiting for her groom
[1273.16 → 1277.28] We'll be a church ready for you
[1277.28 → 1282.16] Every heart longing for our King
[1282.16 → 1287.30] We sing even so come

[1357.40 → 1359.16] So we wait
[1359.16 → 1363.16] We wait for you
[1363.16 → 1368.16] God we wait
[1368.16 → 1372.16] You're coming soon
[1372.16 → 1379.16] We wait for you
[1379.16 → 1381.16] We wait for you
[1381.16 → 1383.16] God we wait

[1418.16 → 1420.16] We'll be a church ready for you
[1420.16 → 1427.16] Every heart longing for our King
[1427.16 → 1431.16] She's going to be a church ready for her groom
[1431.16 → 1436.00] Lord Jesus come
[1436.00 → 1440.64] Even so come
[1440.64 → 1445.16] Lord Jesus come
[1461.16 → 1466.66] Dear God, we are so thankful for the good news
[1466.66 → 1472.94] That you, our Christ, came to this world in human flesh as a baby
[1472.94 → 1478.78] That through your birth, sacrificial death, and resurrection
[1478.78 → 1483.64] We have the faith and hope of eternal life
[1483.64 → 1487.32] For this, we are so grateful
[1487.32 → 1488.84] Amen
[1491.16 → 1517.60] Ten-nine ways for me
[1517.60 → 1520.88] To draw near to you
[1520.88 → 1525.04] But you close yourself with frail humanity
[1525.04 → 1530.04] You did not wait for me
[1530.04 → 1533.12] To cry out to you
[1533.12 → 1537.28] But you let me hear your voice calling me
[1537.28 → 1541.44] And I'm forever grateful to you
[1541.44 → 1550.60] I'm forever grateful for the cross
[1550.60 → 1555.76] I'm forever grateful to you

[1575.24 → 1583.24] And I'm forever grateful to you
[1583.24 → 1584.40] You did not wait for me
[1584.40 → 1585.40] You did not wait for me
[1585.40 → 1587.40] You did not wait for me to cry out to you
[1587.40 → 1592.40] But you let me hear your voice calling me
[1592.40 → 1597.56] And I'm forever grateful to you
[1597.56 → 1600.72] And I'm forever grateful for the cross

[1626.04 → 1630.04] And I'm forever grateful to you
[1630.04 → 1632.04] And I'm forever grateful to you
[1632.04 → 1637.04] And I'm forever grateful to you
[1637.04 → 1647.04] That you came to seek and save the lost
[1647.04 → 1677.02] I'm forever grateful to you
[1677.02 → 1678.02] Good morning everyone
[1678.02 → 1682.02] It's time for the budget
[1682.02 → 1686.02] So first collection today is for the budget
[1686.02 → 1689.02] And the second one to be for the refugee sponsorship
[1689.02 → 1692.02] I have beside me here Hail Mural
[1692.02 → 1696.02] Daughter, the oldest child of the Mural family
[1696.02 → 1698.02] And her parents are here with us
[1698.02 → 1704.02] And they, Hail arrived two years ago, September 16
[1704.02 → 1708.02] I remember it well picking you up from the airport
[1708.02 → 1709.02] And here you are
[1709.02 → 1713.02] And Hail would like to say something to us this morning
[1713.02 → 1715.02] Yeah
[1715.02 → 1729.02] Oh, no, no, nothing, okay
[1729.02 → 1730.02] Okay
[1730.02 → 1734.02] Okay
[1734.02 → 1735.02] Hi everyone
[1735.02 → 1736.02] My name is Hail
[1736.02 → 1743.02] And today I will present a short speech on behalf on my father
[1743.02 → 1745.02] Good morning to you all
[1745.02 → 1748.02] Good morning to my dearest family at Emmanuel Church
[1748.02 → 1753.02] This week I have successfully completed two years and two months in Canada
[1753.02 → 1760.02] Thanks to the grace of God and the church that embraced me and my family
[1760.02 → 1767.02] I would like to thank everyone who has aided me in my troubles in the midst of COVID
[1767.02 → 1773.02] Those who haven't left me till this day, and who made me feel like a son to you
[1773.02 → 1784.02] I would like to personally thank my uncle Peter, Maggie, Pearl, Margaret, Caroline and Wiki and John
[1784.02 → 1788.02] And a lot of you who have been with me
[1788.02 → 1792.02] Also the father of this church who blesses us all
[1792.02 → 1797.02] I would like to specially show my appreciation towards Maggie
[1797.02 → 1801.02] Who is stuck by me and my daughter Hilda
[1801.02 → 1807.02] In her times of need with transportation to school
[1807.02 → 1810.02] Every day I thank God that I am with you
[1810.02 → 1813.02] And would love for you to visit me at home
[1813.02 → 1816.02] Don't forget me, your son Nash wan
[1816.02 → 1819.02] With all love Nash wan and my family
[1819.02 → 1822.02] Beautiful, very good
[1822.02 → 1830.02] I really appreciate that
[1830.02 → 1839.02] We really appreciate like everything you did for us
[1839.02 → 1840.02] Till this day
[1840.02 → 1842.02] Beautiful
[1842.02 → 1847.02] Now, Hail, you only had
[1847.02 → 1849.02] That was a perfect speech
[1849.02 → 1850.02] There was one mistake
[1850.02 → 1851.02] Yeah
[1851.02 → 1853.02] You called Hilda your daughter
[1853.02 → 1854.02] She's your sister
[1854.02 → 1855.02] Oh yeah
[1855.02 → 1857.02] I have to mention this
[1857.02 → 1860.02] My dad was supposed to read the speech
[1860.02 → 1862.02] But yeah
[1862.02 → 1865.02] But because his language he couldn't unfortunately
[1865.02 → 1867.02] So I'm here so we're good
[1867.02 → 1869.02] Oh perfect answer
[1869.02 → 1870.02] Okay awesome
[1870.02 → 1872.02] You can sit down now
[1872.02 → 1873.02] I'm gonna
[1873.02 → 1874.02] Okay
[1874.02 → 1875.02] Okay
[1875.02 → 1878.02] So that's the lead up to our offering for today
[1878.02 → 1881.02] And I know maybe some of you aren't prepared for it
[1881.02 → 1884.02] But it can still come into this calendar year
[1884.02 → 1887.02] You know when I look at our bullet
[1887.02 → 1889.02] No, our church is very, very generous
[1889.02 → 1895.02] We have as our deacons have always a very healthy selection of causes that we can support
[1895.02 → 1900.02] And I know that some of you have picked some and your whole heart and soul goes into it
[1900.02 → 1901.02] I can understand that
[1901.02 → 1903.02] That's the same for me with the refugee
[1903.02 → 1905.02] With the refugee sponsorship program
[1905.02 → 1906.02] But I would like
[1906.02 → 1909.02] This is an awesome opportunity this Christmas season
[1909.02 → 1910.02] Even with your
[1910.02 → 1912.02] Some of us who are older
[1912.02 → 1913.02] As grandparents
[1913.02 → 1915.02] We could talk to our grandchildren
[1915.02 → 1921.02] About how you could sponsor a refugee family through our church
[1921.02 → 1922.02] Or as parents
[1922.02 → 1924.02] This is an opportunity for your children
[1924.02 → 1927.02] Something very, very tangible
[1927.02 → 1928.02] So anyway
[1928.02 → 1930.02] Yeah, we're going
[1930.02 → 1931.02] As I mentioned last Sunday
[1931.02 → 1932.02] We were disappointed
[1932.02 → 1934.02] We had a family already booked
[1934.02 → 1935.02] To go
[1935.02 → 1938.02] And they found another way to get out of the country
[1938.02 → 1941.02] So now we're looking starting up from scratch
[1941.02 → 1942.02] It's not cheap
[1942.02 → 1946.02] We figure it's going to cost us 30 to 35 thousand dollars
[1946.02 → 1949.02] We hope this will probably happen over a two-year period
[1949.02 → 1952.02] So we'll have time to gather our funds and whatever
[1952.02 → 1957.02] But we would like to have a good start with a collection this Sunday
[1957.02 → 1960.02] The Lord loves the cheerful giver
[1960.02 → 1962.02] The Lord loves the alien
[1962.02 → 1964.02] The Lord loves the oppressed
[1964.02 → 1967.02] And we've had an opportunity as a church
[1967.02 → 1971.02] To bring in folk from other parts of the world
[1971.02 → 1973.02] Where there's a lot of suffering
[1973.02 → 1974.02] And we can do our part
[1974.02 → 1975.02] And as you can see
[1975.02 → 1977.02] If you get to know them, you're at family
[1977.02 → 1980.02] They thank God every day for our church
[1980.02 → 1985.02] But primarily they thank God for his care and provision
[1985.02 → 1986.02] Thank you
[1986.02 → 1987.02] Thank you
[1987.42 → 1998.02] 52
[1998.02 → 1999.10] 値 I
[1999.10 → 2000.16] 80
[2000.16 → 2019.48] Who else can cleanse all the hosts of heaven?
[2020.86 → 2025.46] Who else can make every king bow down?
[2025.46 → 2031.38] Who else can whisper and darkness tremble?
[2032.56 → 2036.58] Only a holy God.
[2039.28 → 2043.72] What other beauty demands such praises.
[2045.02 → 2049.16] What other splendour outshines the sun.
[2049.16 → 2055.16] What other majesty rules with justice.
[2056.36 → 2060.38] Only a holy God.
[2063.08 → 2066.96] Come and be on Him.
[2067.30 → 2071.70] Go on and be on me.
[2071.70 → 2076.18] Cry out, sing on me.
[2076.44 → 2079.70] Forever a holy God.
[2079.70 → 2084.62] Come and worship the holy God.
[2084.62 → 2099.34] What other glory consumes like fire.
[2100.60 → 2105.20] What other power can raise the dead.
[2105.20 → 2111.12] What other name remains undefeated.
[2112.12 → 2115.70] Only a holy God.
[2115.70 → 2122.70] Come and be on me.
[2122.70 → 2123.44] Behold Him.
[2123.44 → 2127.70] The one and the only.
[2127.70 → 2132.76] Cry out, sing on me.

[2136.72 → 2141.66] Come and worship the holy God.

[2146.82 → 2151.32] The one and the only.
[2151.32 → 2156.08] Cry out, sing on me.
[2156.08 → 2160.08] Forever a holy God.
[2160.08 → 2164.82] Come and worship the holy God.
[2164.82 → 2179.16] Who else could rescue me from my failing?
[2179.16 → 2184.16] Who else could offer His only Son?
[2184.16 → 2186.16] Who else could offer His only Son?
[2186.16 → 2190.16] Who else might cease to call Him Father?
[2190.16 → 2191.16] Only a holy God.
[2191.16 → 2192.16] Only a holy God.
[2192.16 → 2193.16] Only a holy God.
[2193.16 → 2195.16] Only a holy God.
[2195.16 → 2197.16] Only a holy God.
[2197.16 → 2200.16] Only my holy God.
[2200.16 → 2206.16] Come and be on me.
[2206.16 → 2207.16] Come and be on me.
[2207.16 → 2211.16] For I am the only.
[2211.16 → 2215.16] Cry out, sing on me.
[2215.16 → 2218.16] For I am the only one.
[2218.16 → 2225.16] Come and worship the Holy God.
[2226.62 → 2230.16] Come and behold Him,
[2231.10 → 2235.16] the one and the only.
[2236.10 → 2239.16] Cry out, sing holy,
[2240.34 → 2243.16] forever a Holy God.
[2243.16 → 2248.66] Come and worship the Holy God.
[2261.80 → 2264.96] All right, kids, I'd like to invite you up front for Kids Corner.
[2265.14 → 2265.84] Come on up front.
[2273.16 → 2278.22] Good morning.
[2278.32 → 2279.62] How's everybody doing this morning?
[2281.48 → 2284.00] Anybody notice something interesting about me right now?
[2285.38 → 2287.50] This is like the best time of the year for me.
[2287.56 → 2288.14] I get to wear this.
[2288.14 → 2289.32] I wear this every day.
[2290.82 → 2291.66] Isn't it cool?
[2292.88 → 2295.98] Does anybody here in this group have a Christmas sweater?
[2296.32 → 2297.12] I see one there.
[2297.96 → 2298.44] At home?
[2299.28 → 2301.02] Is it an ugly one or is it a nice one?
[2303.90 → 2304.78] Shirt and sweater.
[2304.82 → 2305.18] How about you?
[2309.66 → 2310.70] It's a nice one.
[2310.90 → 2311.32] Right on.
[2312.36 → 2313.36] Well, what's on my sweater?
[2313.44 → 2314.02] What's on here?
[2314.12 → 2314.80] Who is this guy?
[2314.96 → 2315.32] Rudolph.
[2315.32 → 2315.60] Rudolph.
[2316.52 → 2322.14] Is Christmas about Rudolph or is it about something else?
[2323.18 → 2324.18] Zoe, what's it about?
[2324.32 → 2325.36] It's about Jesus.
[2326.62 → 2328.66] And I was wondering, thinking this morning,
[2328.78 → 2330.62] where was Jesus born?
[2330.82 → 2331.60] Does anybody know?
[2331.70 → 2332.48] Does anybody remember?
[2332.48 → 2332.56] Remember?
[2332.82 → 2333.14] Where?
[2336.52 → 2337.20] He's in heaven.
[2337.24 → 2338.02] But where was he born?
[2339.26 → 2340.72] In what kind of building?
[2341.92 → 2342.28] Yeah.
[2345.02 → 2346.18] In the barn.
[2346.54 → 2348.00] So what I want you guys to do right now
[2348.00 → 2349.08] is I want you to close your eyes
[2349.08 → 2350.16] and I want you to think for a minute.
[2350.32 → 2352.70] If you were to walk into a barn right now,
[2352.80 → 2356.22] what are some of the things you would see, hear, or smell?
[2357.06 → 2358.00] Anybody got any ideas?
[2358.42 → 2359.22] Give me some answers.
[2359.84 → 2360.08] Yeah.
[2360.08 → 2360.12] Yeah.
[2361.64 → 2364.12] You would smell some funny stuff in there.
[2364.20 → 2364.42] Okay.
[2364.52 → 2365.16] Good answer.
[2366.88 → 2367.78] And you have a barn?
[2367.86 → 2368.94] You would know what that smells like?
[2368.98 → 2369.26] Okay.
[2369.36 → 2369.58] Good.
[2370.10 → 2372.36] Zoe, what would you hear, smell, or see?
[2375.76 → 2376.96] You would hear mooing.
[2377.02 → 2378.80] That's probably from a goat.
[2379.22 → 2379.70] Oh, cow.
[2380.06 → 2380.26] Okay.
[2380.70 → 2381.16] That's right.
[2381.20 → 2381.38] Right?
[2381.46 → 2382.18] Farmer person.
[2383.02 → 2383.62] What else?
[2383.62 → 2385.88] You would see horses.
[2387.74 → 2389.26] What would you, what do you think?
[2390.88 → 2393.08] You would hear oink, oink from pigs.
[2393.62 → 2397.20] So it's kind of amazing that Jesus was born in a barn.
[2397.32 → 2398.18] You would hear sheep.
[2398.46 → 2399.28] What does sheep say?
[2400.96 → 2401.36] Right.
[2401.36 → 2405.06] So it's amazing that Jesus was born in a barn.
[2405.54 → 2409.70] And we're going to hear more about this today in the story in the back.
[2410.40 → 2411.82] So why don't I pray with you guys?
[2411.90 → 2413.06] And then we're going to do the blessing.
[2413.40 → 2415.90] And then we'll head out in the back and have some fun.
[2416.04 → 2416.28] All right?
[2417.32 → 2417.94] Can we pray?
[2418.20 → 2418.74] Hold your hands.
[2418.80 → 2419.30] Close your eyes.
[2419.66 → 2422.56] Heavenly Father, thank you so much for all these children here this morning.
[2423.62 → 2427.34] Thank you for this time of the year when we can learn about your birth and all about
[2427.34 → 2429.64] all the stories about that are around that.
[2429.64 → 2433.92] I know we hear it often, but it is still a good reminder to hear this every year.
[2433.92 → 2439.84] Bless the teachers in children's worship time when they share the story to all these kids.
[2440.44 → 2444.56] And be with all the adults, too, as they hear from Pastor Chris this morning.
[2444.64 → 2445.38] For Jesus' sake, amen.
[2446.64 → 2447.98] All right, let's do the blessing.
[2448.18 → 2449.08] Everybody stand up.
[2451.24 → 2453.16] You can turn around and face all the big people.
[2453.88 → 2454.74] Everybody know how to do this?
[2454.78 → 2455.48] Hands out front.
[2456.24 → 2456.54] Ready?
[2456.54 → 2456.62] Ready?
[2457.52 → 2457.90] The.
[2464.10 → 2465.32] Thank you.
[2480.78 → 2481.38] QUESTION LAUGHS
[2485.60 → 2486.02] Thank you.
[2486.02 → 2496.80] Good morning.
[2497.46 → 2498.72] My name is Ken.
[2498.94 → 2500.78] I'm an elder here at Emanuel Church.
[2501.44 → 2504.56] And this morning I'll be leading us in our church family prayer.
[2504.84 → 2506.64] But first I have a couple of announcements.
[2508.64 → 2512.76] First, for all that aren't aware yet,
[2512.76 → 2514.76] there is a congregational meeting tomorrow.
[2514.76 → 2516.30] And it is on Zoom.
[2516.44 → 2518.96] You will find the information in your email.
[2519.52 → 2524.56] And if you're uncertain, just find any of the elders or staff today
[2524.56 → 2526.94] and find out the information about that.
[2527.48 → 2531.06] But we will be gathering on Zoom tomorrow for the congregational meeting.
[2531.24 → 2534.30] So we'd like to see everyone in attendance virtually there.
[2536.10 → 2539.84] Additionally, as you're all aware and as Peter was just speaking to,
[2540.16 → 2541.62] we're approaching the year-end.
[2541.62 → 2546.04] And so on of the big things is all the opportunities that come up for us
[2546.04 → 2548.92] to give out of the blessings that God has bestowed on us.
[2549.26 → 2551.48] And there are actually many opportunities going on right now.
[2551.52 → 2553.02] I just want to draw attention to some of them.
[2553.32 → 2557.08] You'll find a lot of information in the e-bulletin and on social media.
[2557.96 → 2562.54] You'll see a variety of activities that are happening within our church right now,
[2562.62 → 2564.66] including support for flood relief.
[2564.66 → 2568.82] There's the Dress ember fundraising, the refugee sponsorship,
[2569.66 → 2572.64] as Peter was talking about, chairs and squares.
[2573.38 → 2577.36] And, of course, there is our regular ministries of Emanuel Church.
[2577.50 → 2581.90] And that's something I just want to draw attention to and remind us that at this time,
[2582.44 → 2585.20] we are still a bit short on our budget giving.
[2585.20 → 2591.62] And we just want everyone to be thoughtful and mindful and prayerful towards how God has blessed us
[2591.62 → 2594.04] throughout this year and continues to bless us
[2594.04 → 2598.62] and how we can continue to support the ministries of this church and of our denomination
[2598.62 → 2601.62] and of all the different ministries that Emanuel supports.
[2602.58 → 2605.88] So this is a time when we can reflect on God's blessing
[2605.88 → 2611.32] and how we can, in turn, give back to the Lord through our budget giving.
[2611.32 → 2618.64] Additionally, I have an exciting announcement before we go into our church family prayer
[2618.64 → 2622.84] of news that we received from Bob Bass.
[2622.94 → 2629.30] As many of you know, Bob has been struggling or dealing with lymphoma
[2629.30 → 2632.48] and had treatment going on throughout this past year.
[2633.04 → 2638.44] Well, he just got a message from the doctors this week that he's been cleared of all lymphoma.
[2638.44 → 2639.70] So praise the Lord.
[2641.32 → 2645.20] Yeah, we praise God for that. It's exciting news.
[2645.98 → 2649.30] So now I have the privilege of leading us in our church family prayer.
[2649.56 → 2652.24] So let's join our hearts together as we come to our Lord in prayer.
[2655.24 → 2661.42] Gracious God, as we are gathered here as your people in a time of Advent waiting,
[2661.82 → 2668.20] we are thankful and filled with joy for all the mercies and blessings that you pour into our lives.
[2668.20 → 2673.50] Even as we are waiting to celebrate the birth of our Saviour into the world,
[2673.90 → 2681.50] we praise you and glorify you together here for the immeasurable gift of grace that we have in our Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[2682.66 → 2687.02] We recognize that our hope and our comfort come from you alone.
[2687.02 → 2692.40] We confess, Lord, that all too often we hold back from putting our trust in you,
[2692.80 → 2695.76] and we try to control our lives on our own.
[2696.84 → 2698.96] Draw our hearts towards you, Lord.
[2699.68 → 2703.10] Help us to prioritize spending time in prayer and in the Word,
[2703.56 → 2705.10] together as brothers and sisters,
[2705.78 → 2707.04] together with our families,
[2707.54 → 2710.44] and in individual time of devotion to you.
[2710.44 → 2713.30] Our hope is in you alone,
[2713.90 → 2720.50] and so we come to you today as your people to lift our Thanksgiving and our burdens to you.
[2721.94 → 2725.80] Lord, we are so thankful for the news that we celebrate with Bob
[2725.80 → 2727.90] about the healing in his body
[2727.90 → 2734.94] and the ability that he has to continue on in the callings that you've given him, Lord.
[2734.94 → 2739.06] I pray that you would stay near to his family
[2739.06 → 2746.26] and help us all to be celebratory and joyful in the gifts of grace you've bestowed in his life.
[2747.86 → 2752.34] Lord, we were blessed with an opportunity last week to have a memorial service
[2752.34 → 2754.54] to reflect on the life of our brother Dave.
[2755.42 → 2757.94] We're thankful for your grace in his life
[2757.94 → 2760.40] and the impacts that he had on so many people.
[2760.94 → 2764.60] We continue to pray for your blessings on Juanita and their kids.
[2765.82 → 2768.74] As we are approaching the season of Christmas gatherings, Lord,
[2768.82 → 2772.20] we ask for your nearness to all those who have lost loved ones,
[2772.50 → 2773.92] especially over the past year.
[2775.08 → 2779.84] We also pray for those who are unable to gather together as family for the holidays
[2779.84 → 2781.66] for a variety of reasons.
[2783.60 → 2788.42] Lord, we ask that you uphold all those for whom the end of this year is a challenge
[2788.42 → 2791.46] or brings on a lot of stress and burdens.
[2791.46 → 2794.06] We think of our university students, Lord,
[2794.18 → 2796.30] as they're approaching the times of exams.
[2797.18 → 2801.18] And we ask, Father, that you would bless them with clarity of mind
[2801.18 → 2806.54] and the endurance to be able to continue on through the end of this school semester.
[2807.84 → 2813.76] Lord, we pray for all those whose work has been affected by changes over the last couple of years
[2813.76 → 2818.28] and a lot of additional stress for many people who are working under shortages
[2818.28 → 2821.02] or challenges in their work environments.
[2821.60 → 2826.78] Lord, we pray that you'd help us to continue to trust and to put our hope in you.
[2826.78 → 2833.08] We also lift all those in our congregation and outside in our community
[2833.08 → 2838.26] who have been affected by the flooding and landslides and storms that have ravaged this area.
[2839.24 → 2844.00] And Lord, as we're facing a cold season and snow that can bring on additional challenges,
[2844.72 → 2847.42] we ask for your nearness and blessing on all those affected.
[2848.50 → 2852.74] And Lord, we ask that you help us to be a support wherever we can.
[2852.74 → 2858.38] We also lift all those with health concerns in our congregation.
[2859.46 → 2865.30] We pray for those who are getting elderly and that comes with challenges at times, Lord,
[2865.34 → 2867.38] and we ask that you would be near to them.
[2868.40 → 2872.96] We pray for Elsa Hubert as she's still recovering from her fall and surgery,
[2873.16 → 2875.54] and we ask for a full and speedy recovery for Elsa.
[2877.22 → 2882.00] And Lord, in this season of drawn-out pandemic, we pray for patience.
[2882.00 → 2886.52] We pray for our hearts to be considerate and supportive of others.
[2887.74 → 2892.58] There are so many, Lord, who are struggling at this time with anxiety,
[2893.00 → 2897.80] with mental health challenges, with loneliness, depression, and many who are shut in.
[2898.64 → 2902.66] Lord, draw near to them and help each of us to be a support.
[2903.72 → 2907.04] We also pray for those who are caregivers for all these people.
[2907.04 → 2912.74] Lord, it can be exhausting at times, and we ask that you would give them the strength and endurance they need
[2912.74 → 2914.56] to continue on in their service.
[2915.78 → 2921.94] Lord, we know that you guide us, you guard us, you uphold us, and you befriend us.
[2922.50 → 2926.76] Help us to trust in you and to know that we not need to be afraid.
[2926.76 → 2931.56] Lord, give us the strength and encouragement that we need in these times.
[2932.72 → 2941.92] And Lord, as these times bring all sorts of new challenges, and even today as we are in yet another new protocol for how to do worship services,
[2942.14 → 2948.36] Lord, we feel the burden of this ongoing pandemic, and we pray for our leaders who are in government
[2948.36 → 2953.68] and our leaders in our healthcare system who have many difficult decisions to make throughout the way.
[2954.22 → 2955.46] Lord, we pray for wisdom.
[2956.24 → 2961.56] We pray that they would exercise the authority that only comes from you, Lord,
[2961.64 → 2964.76] for we know that all authority in heaven and earth comes from you.
[2965.84 → 2969.98] Lord, remind us in our hearts that you have all things in your hands,
[2970.42 → 2974.34] and all things do work together for the good of those who love him.
[2974.34 → 2982.26] And Lord, we pray for the leaders also in our church and in our denomination.
[2983.26 → 2986.54] And we pray, God, for the Christian Reformed Church,
[2986.84 → 2993.84] that you would give our denomination and our leaders the vision and wisdom and energy and action
[2993.84 → 2997.74] to follow your will and your word for our church.
[2999.62 → 3004.02] Lord, we pray for the congregational meeting that we'll be having within our own church community tomorrow.
[3004.34 → 3010.36] We pray, Lord, that the technical aspects of it would go smoothly and that our meeting would be fruitful
[3010.36 → 3016.94] and that we'd be able to continue to move forward in the ministries of this church in unity.
[3017.74 → 3024.30] Lord, we pray for grace and unity within our families, in our workplaces, and in your church.
[3025.72 → 3029.02] Help us, Lord, to put others before ourselves.
[3029.02 → 3037.90] We ask, Lord, throughout the congregational participation in the life of our church,
[3038.20 → 3040.96] that your word would be spoken.
[3041.94 → 3047.82] Lord, let the ministry and outreach of this church continue to declare your kingdom.
[3048.46 → 3054.06] Help us to be bold and be willing and trusting that we can go forth
[3054.06 → 3061.02] and declare our salvation and your salvation for us to everyone that we meet.
[3062.62 → 3068.14] Lord, impress on our hearts the trust and the longing to prioritize your kingdom work.
[3068.58 → 3072.42] We can get so busy with our own lives and with our own actions and activities.
[3073.24 → 3079.14] Lord, help us to remember at all times that all things that we are here for is for your glory.
[3079.14 → 3087.46] And, Lord, we also ask that you would be with us this week as we prepare our hearts for Lord's Supper next week.
[3088.02 → 3093.82] Help us to have good conversation within our families and with our children and with each other
[3093.82 → 3097.16] as we focus our hearts around you.
[3099.04 → 3106.64] And, Lord, we put our hope and our trust in you throughout this time of Advent waiting and forever.
[3106.64 → 3111.48] We're forever grateful to you for the cross, Lord.
[3112.08 → 3116.68] We're forever grateful for you that you seek us out, and you save us.
[3117.40 → 3120.68] And we're forever grateful, Lord, that you hear our prayers.
[3121.68 → 3128.04] And now as we get to hear the word read from Scripture, Lord, and spoken to us by our pastor,
[3128.24 → 3135.80] we pray that you would speak to us and move us and stir us to continue to grow in faith and in trust of you.
[3135.80 → 3142.12] And that we would continue to fulfill the ministry and calling you have for each of our lives
[3142.12 → 3144.32] and our life as a congregation together.
[3144.76 → 3146.34] We pray this in Jesus' name.
[3147.00 → 3147.24] Amen.
[3165.80 → 3179.36] This Advent and Christmas season, we are preaching a teaching series here called Hallmark Christmas.
[3179.36 → 3179.50] Hallmark Christmas.
[3181.18 → 3185.68] And in that, and Pastor Kevin opened us up last week, we are trying to...
[3185.68 → 3190.66] How do I say this politely?
[3190.82 → 3196.84] We are trying to dispel the cultural myths surrounding Advent and Christmas
[3196.84 → 3202.74] to get beyond the children's Bible versions of these stories.
[3202.74 → 3206.82] And so even as Mr. Eric was up here, and is Eric back in here?
[3206.88 → 3207.54] Is he back yet?
[3207.96 → 3209.76] Because I would say this to his face even if he wasn't.
[3209.84 → 3210.64] So let me be clear on that.
[3211.42 → 3215.46] In two weeks' time, we're going to look at the story of the manger in Bethlehem.
[3215.54 → 3221.24] And boy, is he going to be surprised about what actually happened in that story based on what he told those kids.
[3221.24 → 3233.70] But that's the kind of place we find ourselves and the need that we have to see these stories as they actually are,
[3233.80 → 3236.80] as they were intended to be seen,
[3236.80 → 3245.78] because we have, quite literally, thousands of years cultural influence and formation
[3245.78 → 3253.22] and veggie tales determining how we understand just what's happening in these stories.
[3254.52 → 3267.48] One of the challenges of Advent and Christmas is actually the familiarity that we feel to these stories and texts and songs.
[3268.24 → 3273.06] The challenge that we face, not just as church leaders and pastors or teachers,
[3273.06 → 3275.34] but as Christians during this time,
[3275.96 → 3283.32] is letting the familiar address you or letting the familiar arrest you
[3283.32 → 3286.48] instead of just washing over you.
[3287.88 → 3291.52] One person that I heard this week put it like this, and I'm going to paraphrase them.
[3291.60 → 3291.80] They said,
[3292.42 → 3299.96] the biggest difficulty is that these songs and these stories and this season have sentimental value.
[3299.96 → 3307.54] And so, what they can do is hijack your heart and prevent the text from speaking to your heart.
[3309.08 → 3311.26] You've probably heard the phrase before,
[3311.72 → 3313.38] familiarity breeds contempt.
[3314.34 → 3319.74] I want to suggest that it's probably more accurate to say familiarity breeds indifference.
[3321.38 → 3325.52] And that is why we want to hallmark Christmas.
[3325.52 → 3328.48] Like Kevin said last week,
[3328.54 → 3332.60] we want to put the mess back into Christmas because we are a mess.
[3334.70 → 3337.98] We want to, in some cases perhaps,
[3338.34 → 3343.06] shock you with the truth of the Advent and Christmas story.
[3343.74 → 3347.84] Because too many of us have sort of fallen asleep
[3347.84 → 3351.68] in our familiarity to these stories and texts.
[3351.68 → 3356.14] And so, keep that in mind
[3356.14 → 3359.64] as I read to you Luke 2.
[3360.30 → 3362.12] And we're going to read 8 to 20.
[3362.18 → 3362.96] It'll be on the screen.
[3363.10 → 3365.54] Of course, I encourage you to have it in a Bible,
[3366.00 → 3368.54] either open or in your hand in front of you.
[3368.54 → 3375.84] And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby,
[3376.76 → 3378.92] keeping watch over their flocks at night.
[3379.92 → 3382.54] An angel of the Lord appeared to them,
[3382.64 → 3384.90] and the glory of the Lord shone around them,
[3385.10 → 3386.50] and they were terrified.
[3387.50 → 3389.26] But the angel said to them,
[3389.26 → 3391.06] Do not be afraid.
[3391.88 → 3396.46] I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all people.
[3397.20 → 3398.94] Today, in the town of David,
[3399.08 → 3400.82] a Saviour has been born to you.
[3401.62 → 3403.96] He is the Messiah, the Lord.
[3404.66 → 3406.50] This will be a sign to you.
[3406.62 → 3409.12] You will find a baby wrapped in cloths
[3409.12 → 3410.76] and lying in a manger.
[3412.04 → 3414.64] Suddenly, a great company of heavenly hosts
[3414.64 → 3415.84] appeared with the angel,
[3416.00 → 3417.34] praising God and saying,
[3417.34 → 3419.34] Glory to God in the highest heaven
[3419.34 → 3420.50] and on earth,
[3420.66 → 3423.94] Peace to those on whom his favour rests.
[3425.18 → 3427.02] When the angels had left them
[3427.02 → 3427.96] and gone into heaven,
[3428.06 → 3429.56] the shepherds said to one another,
[3429.90 → 3431.32] Let's go to Bethlehem
[3431.32 → 3432.98] and see this thing that has happened
[3432.98 → 3434.60] which the Lord has told us about.
[3436.02 → 3437.10] And so they hurried off
[3437.10 → 3438.58] and found Mary and Joseph
[3438.58 → 3440.60] and the baby who was lying in the manger.
[3441.72 → 3443.04] When they had seen him,
[3443.14 → 3444.52] they spread word concerning
[3444.52 → 3446.82] what had been told them about this child
[3446.82 → 3448.46] and all who heard it
[3448.46 → 3450.58] were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.
[3451.58 → 3453.42] But Mary treasured up these things
[3453.42 → 3455.10] and pondered them in her heart.
[3456.44 → 3457.80] The shepherds returned,
[3458.74 → 3460.52] glorifying and praising God
[3460.52 → 3463.16] for all the things that they had heard and seen
[3463.16 → 3467.14] which were just as they had been told.
[3468.10 → 3469.34] This is the word of the Lord.
[3469.34 → 3475.88] Now when Advent and Christmas
[3475.88 → 3481.68] are only the hallmarked cultural versions
[3481.68 → 3484.40] of the stories that we are so familiar with,
[3484.52 → 3485.98] overly familiar with,
[3486.34 → 3487.66] to be honest,
[3487.84 → 3491.60] of course we become indifferent to it.
[3492.42 → 3492.88] Right?
[3492.92 → 3493.38] Like we said,
[3493.50 → 3495.72] familiarity breeds indifference
[3495.72 → 3497.32] and our hallmarked versions
[3497.32 → 3498.48] of these stories
[3498.48 → 3500.46] don't move us.
[3501.52 → 3502.96] Our hearts have been,
[3503.00 → 3504.60] in the language of that other person,
[3504.76 → 3507.70] hijacked towards a mere sentimentality.
[3508.86 → 3510.20] Now let me be really clear.
[3511.04 → 3511.20] Okay?
[3511.26 → 3514.70] Because I'm talking to those of us
[3514.70 → 3518.20] who are indifferent
[3518.20 → 3520.18] to Advent and Christmas,
[3520.18 → 3521.14] to those of us
[3521.14 → 3522.56] who are just like,
[3523.10 → 3523.42] meh.
[3524.76 → 3525.16] Right?
[3525.22 → 3525.96] You know who you are.
[3527.08 → 3527.52] Right?
[3527.58 → 3528.60] You're not quite a Drink,
[3529.12 → 3530.56] but you don't really care.
[3531.52 → 3531.74] Right?
[3531.78 → 3532.02] You're like,
[3532.06 → 3532.60] yeah, okay,
[3532.72 → 3534.26] I know the stories.
[3534.40 → 3534.52] Right?
[3534.54 → 3535.00] There are angels
[3535.00 → 3535.78] and there are shepherds
[3535.78 → 3536.96] and there's baby Jesus.
[3537.18 → 3538.06] There are some songs
[3538.06 → 3538.68] and, you know,
[3538.72 → 3540.06] there's peppermint lattes
[3540.06 → 3541.40] and candy cane ice cream.
[3541.80 → 3542.20] Whatever.
[3543.90 → 3544.96] And if that's you,
[3545.82 → 3547.30] I want to shock you
[3547.30 → 3548.94] with the truth of this story.
[3550.34 → 3550.82] But,
[3551.60 → 3552.74] I also,
[3554.24 → 3555.86] and perhaps even more,
[3556.22 → 3557.70] want to talk to those of you
[3557.70 → 3559.70] who love Christmas.
[3560.50 → 3560.72] Right?
[3560.78 → 3561.72] The kind of person
[3561.72 → 3564.38] who asks on November 1st,
[3564.42 → 3565.06] is it too early
[3565.06 → 3566.06] to put up the Christmas tree?
[3566.98 → 3567.22] Right?
[3567.28 → 3568.04] Halloween is over,
[3568.10 → 3569.02] the spiders go away
[3569.02 → 3570.06] and the Santa's come out.
[3571.06 → 3571.54] Right?
[3571.56 → 3572.28] When that transition
[3572.28 → 3573.28] from pumpkin spice
[3573.28 → 3574.44] to eggnog happens,
[3574.50 → 3575.20] it really is
[3575.20 → 3576.50] the most wonderful time
[3576.50 → 3577.02] of the year.
[3578.28 → 3579.10] I promised Rachel
[3579.10 → 3579.60] last week
[3579.60 → 3580.36] after Pastor Kevin
[3580.36 → 3581.44] sang that song for you
[3581.44 → 3582.40] that I wouldn't sing
[3582.40 → 3583.24] that song for you.
[3583.66 → 3583.86] But,
[3584.46 → 3585.30] hear Kevin's voice.
[3587.26 → 3588.34] Let me ask you,
[3588.96 → 3590.74] if you love Christmas,
[3591.60 → 3592.58] what do you love
[3592.58 → 3593.34] about Christmas?
[3593.46 → 3593.56] Or,
[3593.68 → 3594.68] if you love Christmas,
[3594.90 → 3596.58] why do you love Christmas?
[3596.84 → 3597.62] And I get it,
[3597.66 → 3597.78] right?
[3597.82 → 3599.14] I get a number of reasons
[3599.14 → 3599.34] why.
[3599.50 → 3600.92] The music is special,
[3601.16 → 3601.36] right?
[3601.38 → 3602.74] And it's all the more special
[3602.74 → 3603.44] because it's really
[3603.44 → 3605.24] only around for a month
[3605.24 → 3606.62] or five weeks
[3606.62 → 3607.56] if you're lucky,
[3608.34 → 3608.60] right?
[3608.96 → 3610.30] Around this time of year,
[3610.50 → 3611.28] we get to get
[3611.28 → 3613.00] and we get to give gifts
[3613.00 → 3614.34] and that's a lot of fun.
[3614.44 → 3615.64] You get to have big dinners.
[3616.30 → 3617.38] Once upon a time,
[3617.44 → 3618.08] we had things like
[3618.08 → 3618.94] office parties,
[3619.40 → 3619.60] right?
[3620.42 → 3621.90] Friendsmases happen,
[3622.24 → 3622.80] Friends mas,
[3623.18 → 3623.34] right?
[3623.42 → 3624.06] Christmas gathering
[3624.06 → 3624.66] for friends,
[3624.92 → 3625.08] right?
[3625.08 → 3626.38] Those are all good things
[3626.38 → 3627.64] and if you love
[3627.64 → 3629.00] Advent and Christmas,
[3629.16 → 3629.78] ask yourself,
[3630.14 → 3630.58] why?
[3630.84 → 3632.28] Because is your love
[3632.28 → 3633.46] of these things
[3633.46 → 3635.60] really a mere
[3635.60 → 3636.76] sentimentality?
[3638.36 → 3639.50] Is it because it's
[3639.50 → 3641.96] feels nice?
[3644.14 → 3645.38] And if that's you,
[3646.00 → 3647.22] I want to challenge you
[3647.22 → 3647.90] as well.
[3648.58 → 3649.40] Because you see,
[3649.66 → 3651.04] whether your approach
[3651.04 → 3652.34] to Advent and Christmas
[3652.34 → 3653.56] is meh
[3653.56 → 3655.64] or it really is for you
[3655.64 → 3656.60] the most wonderful time
[3656.60 → 3657.16] of the year,
[3657.56 → 3658.82] the danger is that
[3658.82 → 3660.38] both of those attitudes
[3660.38 → 3661.58] are based on
[3661.58 → 3663.16] or the result of
[3663.16 → 3664.80] a mere sentimentality.
[3665.06 → 3666.60] Either an indifference
[3666.60 → 3668.68] to what has become sentimental
[3668.68 → 3671.24] or it's a high sentimentality
[3671.24 → 3672.70] that hijacks your heart
[3672.70 → 3674.46] because it feels quaint.
[3676.22 → 3679.86] The danger of the overly familiar
[3679.86 → 3683.46] is the danger of a hallmark Christmas.
[3683.46 → 3685.80] Instead,
[3686.84 → 3687.08] right,
[3687.14 → 3688.40] we want the truth
[3688.40 → 3689.46] of Christmas
[3689.46 → 3691.14] to captivate
[3691.14 → 3692.64] your heart.
[3692.94 → 3693.40] We want the
[3693.56 → 3694.36] quite literally,
[3694.54 → 3695.38] the anxiety
[3695.38 → 3696.50] of Advent
[3696.50 → 3697.56] to overcome
[3697.56 → 3698.72] your apathy.
[3699.48 → 3700.64] Instead of
[3700.64 → 3702.16] a hallmarked
[3702.16 → 3703.46] mere sentimentality,
[3703.70 → 3704.80] we want you to picture
[3704.80 → 3705.36] again,
[3705.48 → 3706.64] to imagine again,
[3706.88 → 3707.58] Emmanuel,
[3708.18 → 3709.46] God with us.
[3709.46 → 3711.64] because really,
[3711.88 → 3712.56] and again,
[3712.68 → 3713.98] Pastor Kevin did a great job
[3713.98 → 3714.96] of starting us off
[3714.96 → 3715.98] in this last week.
[3716.36 → 3717.52] These stories,
[3717.78 → 3719.02] so familiar
[3719.02 → 3721.12] to most of us,
[3721.38 → 3722.90] are meant
[3722.90 → 3724.06] to shock you.
[3726.46 → 3727.06] And so,
[3727.12 → 3727.48] the stories
[3727.48 → 3728.58] begin.
[3729.86 → 3730.76] In fair Verona,
[3730.88 → 3731.74] we lay our scene.
[3732.06 → 3732.34] Except,
[3732.46 → 3733.24] it's not Verona
[3733.24 → 3734.50] and this isn't a story
[3734.50 → 3735.86] about two star-crossed lovers.
[3735.86 → 3737.72] This is Bethlehem
[3737.72 → 3739.10] and it is the chaos
[3739.10 → 3740.30] and the animosity
[3740.30 → 3741.84] in the culture
[3741.84 → 3742.62] and in the space
[3742.62 → 3743.58] because that emperor
[3743.58 → 3744.48] over in Rome
[3744.48 → 3745.16] has decided
[3745.16 → 3746.14] to call a census.
[3747.70 → 3748.62] And even the act
[3748.62 → 3750.22] of calling a census
[3750.22 → 3752.02] creates tension
[3752.02 → 3753.42] in the story.
[3753.76 → 3754.44] Something that's really,
[3754.54 → 3754.84] actually,
[3754.96 → 3755.70] easily missed
[3755.70 → 3756.58] in today's world.
[3757.66 → 3758.94] And for most of us,
[3759.00 → 3759.36] those of us
[3759.36 → 3760.16] who are old enough
[3760.16 → 3761.24] or intentional enough
[3761.24 → 3762.70] will be aware of this,
[3762.70 → 3765.30] the most anxiety-inducing thing
[3765.30 → 3766.04] about the government
[3766.04 → 3767.10] doing a census,
[3767.52 → 3767.76] right,
[3767.82 → 3768.80] for us here in Canada
[3768.80 → 3769.64] is whether
[3769.64 → 3770.20] you're going to get
[3770.20 → 3771.22] the long form
[3771.22 → 3772.60] or the short form.
[3774.64 → 3775.12] Right,
[3775.16 → 3775.84] and even that,
[3775.92 → 3776.48] the long form,
[3776.54 → 3776.96] was optional
[3776.96 → 3777.66] for 10 years
[3777.66 → 3778.66] prior to 2016.
[3779.94 → 3781.04] In Palestine,
[3781.46 → 3781.80] however,
[3783.06 → 3784.42] everyone knows
[3784.42 → 3786.00] that this is a power play.
[3786.80 → 3787.96] Everyone knows
[3787.96 → 3788.98] that the census
[3788.98 → 3789.94] is a pretext
[3789.94 → 3791.10] for raising taxes,
[3791.10 → 3792.14] for bringing in
[3792.14 → 3793.22] more Roman soldiers.
[3794.20 → 3794.60] Here,
[3794.92 → 3796.06] everyone realizes
[3796.06 → 3797.58] that this is a chance
[3797.58 → 3798.90] for the ruling elite
[3798.90 → 3799.98] to increase
[3799.98 → 3801.10] political oppression.
[3803.22 → 3804.52] And in the fields
[3804.52 → 3805.64] around Bethlehem
[3805.64 → 3807.50] are these shepherds
[3807.50 → 3809.50] watching their sheep
[3809.50 → 3811.96] doing what hard-working,
[3812.12 → 3812.78] rough-and-tumble,
[3812.94 → 3813.40] outcast,
[3813.56 → 3814.46] and forgotten men
[3814.46 → 3815.42] have always done,
[3816.68 → 3818.22] rumbling and complaining
[3818.22 → 3819.58] about those in power.
[3821.10 → 3821.60] Now,
[3821.66 → 3822.12] to be fair,
[3822.62 → 3824.14] we don't actually know
[3824.14 → 3825.32] what they were talking about.
[3825.40 → 3826.26] We don't actually know
[3826.26 → 3827.34] the kinds of conversations
[3827.34 → 3828.92] that they were having.
[3829.02 → 3829.78] We can't know that.
[3829.84 → 3831.82] The text doesn't tell us.
[3832.32 → 3832.70] But,
[3832.82 → 3834.08] we can know
[3834.08 → 3834.60] something
[3834.60 → 3835.44] about
[3835.44 → 3836.32] these
[3836.32 → 3837.12] kinds
[3837.12 → 3837.76] of
[3837.76 → 3838.60] people.
[3838.96 → 3839.60] We can know
[3839.60 → 3840.06] something
[3840.06 → 3840.92] about
[3840.92 → 3841.90] these men
[3841.90 → 3842.98] because Luke,
[3843.10 → 3843.94] in this text,
[3844.06 → 3844.96] makes a point
[3844.96 → 3846.08] of telling us
[3846.08 → 3847.52] that they are shepherds.
[3847.52 → 3850.26] If you have it
[3850.26 → 3850.90] in front of you,
[3851.62 → 3852.72] you can do a quick scan.
[3853.12 → 3854.30] Four times
[3854.30 → 3856.18] in these short verses,
[3857.06 → 3858.40] Luke tells us
[3858.40 → 3859.68] that they were shepherds.
[3859.74 → 3860.68] He uses the words
[3860.68 → 3861.16] shepherds.
[3861.24 → 3862.20] It's true in English
[3862.20 → 3863.34] and it's also true
[3863.34 → 3864.62] in the Greek text,
[3864.70 → 3865.98] in the original language.
[3866.54 → 3866.80] Now,
[3866.86 → 3867.34] I don't want to make
[3867.34 → 3868.06] too much of this
[3868.06 → 3869.30] or dwell here for too long
[3869.30 → 3870.10] because I didn't really
[3870.10 → 3871.00] think too much of it
[3871.00 → 3871.88] until I compared it
[3871.88 → 3872.76] to another text.
[3873.52 → 3873.72] But,
[3873.80 → 3874.86] a similar type
[3874.86 → 3875.76] of story
[3875.76 → 3876.44] and a similar
[3876.44 → 3878.26] way of conveying
[3878.26 → 3878.86] meaning
[3878.86 → 3879.70] happens again
[3879.70 → 3880.80] in Luke 9.
[3881.18 → 3881.78] In Luke 9,
[3881.84 → 3882.94] verse 40 to 56,
[3883.30 → 3884.28] you have the story
[3884.28 → 3885.64] of Jabirus
[3885.64 → 3887.02] who is the ruler
[3887.02 → 3887.68] in the synagogue
[3887.68 → 3888.48] and his daughter
[3888.48 → 3889.36] who is really sick
[3889.36 → 3890.48] and who eventually dies.
[3890.64 → 3891.86] Jabirus comes to Jesus
[3891.86 → 3892.88] and pleads,
[3893.22 → 3894.26] come back to my house,
[3894.62 → 3895.36] heal my daughter.
[3896.66 → 3896.86] Right?
[3896.90 → 3898.02] When you read that story
[3898.02 → 3899.24] in your English Bible,
[3899.66 → 3900.66] four times
[3900.66 → 3901.42] the name Jabirus
[3901.42 → 3901.76] is there.
[3902.76 → 3903.40] But when you read it
[3903.40 → 3903.90] in Greek,
[3904.62 → 3905.76] the name's only there once.
[3908.02 → 3909.02] What is repeated
[3909.02 → 3910.24] is the pronoun
[3910.24 → 3912.26] or the verbal inclusion
[3912.26 → 3913.02] of the noun
[3913.02 → 3914.00] which happens in Greek
[3914.00 → 3915.56] or twice
[3915.56 → 3916.48] his title
[3916.48 → 3917.10] as ruler
[3917.10 → 3917.76] of the synagogue.
[3918.86 → 3918.98] Now,
[3919.02 → 3919.68] let me be really clear
[3919.68 → 3920.30] because Luke
[3920.30 → 3921.30] is a good writer.
[3922.52 → 3922.62] Right?
[3922.64 → 3923.36] He is a doctor.
[3923.54 → 3924.68] He is a trained professional
[3924.68 → 3926.00] with academic credibility.
[3926.46 → 3927.12] He understands
[3927.12 → 3928.08] the importance
[3928.08 → 3929.40] of what grammarians
[3929.40 → 3930.82] call sentence variety.
[3931.30 → 3931.46] Right?
[3931.50 → 3932.62] Especially in the variety
[3932.62 → 3933.80] of uses of subjects
[3933.80 → 3934.26] or nouns
[3934.26 → 3934.84] or pronouns.
[3935.54 → 3936.70] And if he is repeating
[3936.70 → 3937.50] one of them,
[3937.66 → 3938.44] we can conclude
[3938.44 → 3939.38] that it has to be
[3939.38 → 3941.32] for an intentional purpose.
[3942.14 → 3942.22] Right?
[3942.28 → 3943.34] Luke doesn't want you
[3943.34 → 3944.02] to miss
[3944.02 → 3946.12] that these first witnesses
[3946.12 → 3947.76] of Jesus coming,
[3947.90 → 3948.74] of Emmanuel,
[3949.00 → 3949.64] God with us,
[3949.88 → 3951.22] are shepherds.
[3952.84 → 3953.50] And just like
[3953.50 → 3954.48] in this parallel story,
[3954.52 → 3955.52] in the Jabirus story,
[3955.60 → 3956.34] where what matters
[3956.34 → 3957.30] is that Jabirus
[3957.30 → 3957.96] is the leader
[3957.96 → 3958.82] of the synagogue,
[3958.82 → 3959.80] what matters
[3959.80 → 3960.84] in this story
[3960.84 → 3962.24] is that these men
[3962.24 → 3964.24] are shepherds.
[3965.28 → 3965.80] Now,
[3966.04 → 3967.36] this is our focus
[3967.36 → 3968.70] for this morning.
[3968.96 → 3971.76] And perhaps you've heard
[3971.76 → 3973.12] some of these sorts
[3973.12 → 3974.28] of things in the past,
[3974.34 → 3975.48] although I still think
[3975.48 → 3976.44] for many of us,
[3976.46 → 3976.60] right,
[3976.64 → 3978.60] in the hallmarked version
[3978.60 → 3980.54] of this story,
[3980.54 → 3982.00] we think of shepherds
[3982.00 → 3982.84] kind of like
[3982.84 → 3985.22] that grandfatherly figure
[3985.22 → 3985.94] who still works
[3985.94 → 3986.54] on the farm.
[3987.40 → 3987.66] Right?
[3987.70 → 3988.98] He comes in from the field
[3988.98 → 3990.30] ready to gather
[3990.30 → 3991.42] his grandkids
[3991.42 → 3992.58] or to hold
[3992.58 → 3994.06] the little newborn
[3994.06 → 3995.48] great-grandchild
[3995.48 → 3996.52] that was born to him.
[3996.60 → 3996.82] Sure,
[3996.92 → 3998.16] his hands are a little dirty
[3998.16 → 3999.08] and they're rough
[3999.08 → 3999.80] because he's worked
[3999.80 → 4000.64] for 60 years
[4000.64 → 4001.76] in hard labour,
[4001.88 → 4002.32] absolutely,
[4002.80 → 4003.66] but his beard
[4003.66 → 4005.06] is still perfectly manicured
[4005.06 → 4007.02] and he doesn't smell
[4007.02 → 4007.48] of sheep
[4007.48 → 4009.08] or of manure.
[4009.36 → 4009.56] Sorry.
[4011.80 → 4011.96] Right?
[4012.02 → 4012.94] In your nativity set
[4012.94 → 4013.54] at home,
[4014.02 → 4015.20] probably one of the shepherds
[4015.20 → 4016.34] is carrying a little lamb.
[4016.54 → 4018.06] Just to show how nice
[4018.06 → 4019.02] and quaint
[4019.02 → 4020.56] these people are.
[4020.68 → 4021.66] But that's just not
[4021.66 → 4022.52] how it was.
[4023.80 → 4024.82] First,
[4025.04 → 4025.16] right,
[4025.30 → 4026.36] shepherds are men
[4026.36 → 4027.00] of the land.
[4027.12 → 4028.48] They live with their sheep
[4028.48 → 4030.08] and they live
[4030.08 → 4032.08] in their sheep's manure.
[4033.16 → 4033.64] Right?
[4033.72 → 4034.70] From grazing area
[4034.70 → 4035.84] to grazing area.
[4036.64 → 4037.22] In fact,
[4037.34 → 4038.26] to the south
[4038.26 → 4039.16] of Bethlehem,
[4039.86 → 4040.52] you can stand
[4040.52 → 4041.38] on the southern edge
[4041.38 → 4042.44] of the city of Bethlehem,
[4042.48 → 4043.00] the old city
[4043.00 → 4043.66] and the new city,
[4043.72 → 4044.52] and look to the south
[4044.52 → 4045.58] and all you see
[4045.58 → 4047.14] is the Judean wilderness.
[4048.96 → 4049.58] You can stand
[4049.58 → 4050.50] at the edge of the city
[4050.50 → 4051.16] and what you see
[4051.16 → 4051.92] is wild,
[4052.52 → 4052.86] rocky,
[4053.36 → 4054.60] untamed land
[4054.60 → 4055.76] as far as the eye
[4055.76 → 4056.28] can see.
[4056.40 → 4058.04] It is not hospitable
[4058.04 → 4059.10] and that's where
[4059.10 → 4059.54] they lived.
[4060.30 → 4061.32] That is the land
[4061.32 → 4062.48] of shepherds
[4062.48 → 4062.92] and it takes
[4062.92 → 4063.80] a certain type
[4063.80 → 4064.66] of man
[4064.66 → 4065.96] to sleep on the ground
[4065.96 → 4066.48] or person
[4066.48 → 4067.58] to sleep on the ground,
[4067.68 → 4069.02] to live in a cave,
[4069.14 → 4070.00] to defend
[4070.00 → 4070.70] from lions
[4070.70 → 4071.28] and bears
[4071.28 → 4072.10] and cheetahs
[4072.10 → 4072.98] and crocodiles,
[4073.16 → 4074.02] all of which
[4074.02 → 4074.78] would have still
[4074.78 → 4075.46] lived in the land
[4075.46 → 4075.98] at this time.
[4076.86 → 4076.98] Right?
[4077.04 → 4077.40] Some of those
[4077.40 → 4078.02] have been extinct
[4078.02 → 4079.38] in Israel today
[4079.38 → 4080.10] but they still
[4080.10 → 4080.70] were there.
[4081.12 → 4081.36] Then,
[4082.36 → 4083.56] constant threats.
[4085.56 → 4086.14] There's actually
[4086.14 → 4088.36] a Jewish midrash
[4088.36 → 4089.68] on Psalm 23.
[4090.60 → 4090.72] Now,
[4090.82 → 4091.48] a midrash
[4091.48 → 4092.60] is a sort of
[4092.60 → 4094.28] rabbinical commentary.
[4094.84 → 4095.46] The rabbis,
[4095.58 → 4095.98] the teachers
[4095.98 → 4096.64] in Judaism
[4096.64 → 4098.40] would talk about
[4098.40 → 4099.74] the writings
[4099.74 → 4100.44] of scripture,
[4100.78 → 4101.36] the Tanaka,
[4101.36 → 4101.92] which is their
[4101.92 → 4102.58] word for scripture
[4102.58 → 4104.46] and then record
[4104.46 → 4105.50] their reflections
[4105.50 → 4105.98] on it.
[4106.08 → 4106.52] Those are called
[4106.52 → 4107.10] midrashes.
[4108.02 → 4108.86] There is a midrash
[4108.86 → 4109.94] on Psalm 23
[4109.94 → 4112.58] that comes from
[4112.58 → 4113.44] either before
[4113.44 → 4114.08] the time of Jesus
[4114.08 → 4114.96] or slightly at
[4114.96 → 4115.62] or around
[4115.62 → 4116.60] the time of Jesus
[4116.60 → 4118.16] and this particular
[4118.16 → 4119.34] midrash says,
[4120.38 → 4121.54] in the whole world
[4121.54 → 4122.34] you will find
[4122.34 → 4123.30] no occupation
[4123.30 → 4124.94] more despised
[4124.94 → 4126.22] than that
[4126.22 → 4126.72] of a shepherd.
[4128.80 → 4129.62] That's what people
[4129.62 → 4129.98] thought
[4129.98 → 4131.66] about shepherds.
[4132.90 → 4133.30] There's actually
[4133.30 → 4134.28] a part of the
[4134.28 → 4135.50] Babylonian Talmud.
[4135.98 → 4136.40] Again,
[4136.80 → 4137.78] if midrashes
[4137.78 → 4138.66] are commentaries
[4138.66 → 4139.48] on the Tanaka,
[4139.60 → 4140.16] the Talmud
[4140.16 → 4140.84] is sort of
[4140.84 → 4141.48] commentaries
[4141.48 → 4143.04] on the implications
[4143.04 → 4144.16] of the Bible.
[4144.74 → 4144.86] Right?
[4144.92 → 4145.64] They're a collection
[4145.64 → 4146.38] of teachings
[4146.38 → 4147.20] from rabbis
[4147.20 → 4148.38] and spiritual leaders
[4148.38 → 4149.88] based on oral tradition,
[4150.14 → 4151.42] based on the interpretation
[4151.42 → 4152.20] of the Bible.
[4153.16 → 4153.90] And the Talmud
[4153.90 → 4155.18] was compiled,
[4156.18 → 4157.20] started to be collected
[4157.20 → 4158.38] after the exile,
[4158.86 → 4159.90] really focused in
[4159.90 → 4161.08] around 200 B.C.
[4161.08 → 4162.22] and then all the way
[4162.22 → 4163.06] through into
[4163.06 → 4164.16] like the 12th
[4164.16 → 4165.00] or the 4th
[4165.00 → 4166.66] or 5th century A.D.
[4167.22 → 4168.20] And so you get
[4168.20 → 4169.80] this fairly accurate
[4169.80 → 4171.04] picture of what
[4171.04 → 4172.18] the Jewish people
[4172.18 → 4173.04] of the time
[4173.04 → 4174.04] thought
[4174.04 → 4175.50] by reading the Talmud.
[4175.50 → 4179.76] The Talmud says
[4179.76 → 4180.92] that there are
[4180.92 → 4182.12] two different groups
[4182.12 → 4182.76] of people
[4182.76 → 4184.22] that Jewish citizens
[4184.22 → 4185.42] don't have
[4185.42 → 4186.24] to help.
[4188.22 → 4188.70] Heathens,
[4189.28 → 4190.12] people who don't
[4190.12 → 4190.76] believe in God,
[4192.40 → 4193.26] and you've guessed it,
[4193.74 → 4194.18] shepherds.
[4195.88 → 4196.50] Shepherds
[4196.50 → 4198.00] are in the same category
[4198.00 → 4198.88] of people
[4198.88 → 4199.80] as unbelievers.
[4200.62 → 4200.74] Right?
[4200.78 → 4201.78] There's no further
[4201.78 → 4202.48] outside
[4202.48 → 4204.04] in the Jewish world.
[4204.04 → 4205.94] In fact,
[4206.10 → 4207.34] the Talmud also says
[4207.34 → 4208.54] because of this
[4208.54 → 4209.34] general idea
[4209.34 → 4210.54] that shepherds
[4210.54 → 4211.26] are liars
[4211.26 → 4212.24] and that regularly
[4212.24 → 4213.30] they steal
[4213.30 → 4214.96] and so shepherds
[4214.96 → 4216.58] are unfit
[4216.58 → 4217.62] as witnesses
[4217.62 → 4219.34] and are unable
[4219.34 → 4221.04] to give trusted oaths.
[4222.20 → 4223.52] I want you to hear that,
[4224.00 → 4224.96] especially that last one.
[4226.68 → 4226.84] Right?
[4227.34 → 4228.16] Who is it
[4228.16 → 4230.20] that God calls
[4230.20 → 4231.46] to be the first
[4231.46 → 4232.24] witnesses
[4232.24 → 4233.10] of the birth
[4233.10 → 4233.62] of Jesus?
[4234.04 → 4236.16] a group
[4236.16 → 4236.80] of people
[4236.80 → 4238.08] who are unfit
[4238.08 → 4239.06] as witnesses
[4239.06 → 4240.38] and can't even
[4240.38 → 4241.58] give legal testimony
[4241.58 → 4242.20] in court.
[4242.82 → 4244.36] The first witnesses
[4244.36 → 4245.88] of the incarnation
[4245.88 → 4246.52] of God,
[4246.62 → 4247.42] the first witnesses
[4247.42 → 4248.46] of Emmanuel,
[4248.88 → 4250.00] the first witnesses
[4250.00 → 4250.52] of Advent
[4250.52 → 4251.22] and Christmas
[4251.22 → 4253.20] are the ones
[4253.20 → 4253.86] who could never
[4253.86 → 4254.46] be called
[4254.46 → 4255.14] as witnesses.
[4258.88 → 4259.78] In your mind,
[4259.86 → 4260.34] maybe you've already
[4260.34 → 4261.06] made this connection.
[4261.90 → 4262.26] But again,
[4262.40 → 4263.00] sticking with Luke,
[4263.00 → 4263.88] but now to the end
[4263.88 → 4265.04] of the book,
[4265.12 → 4266.42] in Luke chapter 24,
[4267.26 → 4268.60] who are the first witnesses
[4268.60 → 4269.42] of the resurrection?
[4271.64 → 4272.78] It's a group of women
[4272.78 → 4274.78] who went to see Jesus.
[4275.92 → 4277.38] Women who also
[4277.38 → 4278.98] could not be called upon
[4278.98 → 4280.20] as legal witnesses.
[4280.74 → 4282.00] Women whose testimony
[4282.00 → 4284.06] was also inadmissible
[4284.06 → 4286.58] in the religion-political court
[4286.58 → 4287.36] of the day.
[4287.36 → 4288.96] Again,
[4289.38 → 4290.48] Luke is a good writer
[4290.48 → 4291.56] and he's making
[4291.56 → 4292.20] this point
[4292.20 → 4293.40] very specifically,
[4293.78 → 4294.86] very intentionally.
[4296.36 → 4297.20] Luke 24,
[4297.92 → 4298.76] verse 10 and 11
[4298.76 → 4299.10] says,
[4299.62 → 4300.24] It was Mary,
[4300.38 → 4300.94] Magdalene,
[4301.06 → 4301.40] Joanna,
[4301.64 → 4301.86] Mary,
[4301.96 → 4302.76] the mother of James,
[4302.82 → 4303.50] and the other women
[4303.50 → 4303.96] with them
[4303.96 → 4304.68] who told this
[4304.68 → 4305.46] to the disciples.
[4305.94 → 4306.46] But they,
[4306.54 → 4307.36] that is the disciples,
[4307.72 → 4308.74] did not believe
[4308.74 → 4309.24] the women
[4309.24 → 4310.32] because their words
[4310.32 → 4311.42] seemed to them
[4311.42 → 4312.44] like nonsense.
[4312.44 → 4315.24] The disciples
[4315.24 → 4316.24] were a man of their day.
[4318.34 → 4318.82] The women
[4318.82 → 4320.10] also
[4320.10 → 4321.96] are unlikely witnesses.
[4322.42 → 4323.40] The gospel story
[4323.40 → 4323.90] of Jesus
[4323.90 → 4325.30] is book ended
[4325.30 → 4327.28] by impossible witnesses.
[4327.76 → 4328.84] The message of Jesus
[4328.84 → 4329.82] is first given
[4329.82 → 4331.24] to the most unlikely
[4331.24 → 4332.36] of characters.
[4333.30 → 4334.82] People who the world
[4334.82 → 4336.50] would never listen to
[4336.50 → 4337.98] are given the message,
[4338.14 → 4338.98] Glory to God
[4338.98 → 4339.90] in the highest heaven
[4339.90 → 4340.50] and on earth,
[4340.62 → 4341.38] peace to those
[4341.38 → 4341.86] on whom
[4341.86 → 4343.74] his favour rests.
[4345.22 → 4346.26] And now,
[4346.62 → 4347.04] today,
[4347.78 → 4350.14] in our hallmark
[4350.14 → 4351.42] Christmas stories,
[4351.80 → 4351.94] right,
[4352.00 → 4353.40] by turning the shepherds
[4353.40 → 4354.34] into something
[4354.34 → 4355.30] they are not,
[4355.54 → 4356.62] we run the risk
[4356.62 → 4357.78] of turning Christmas
[4357.78 → 4358.90] into something
[4358.90 → 4359.68] it is not.
[4359.86 → 4360.70] We run the risk
[4360.70 → 4361.84] of creating a gospel
[4361.84 → 4362.86] which is no gospel
[4362.86 → 4363.76] at all, right?
[4363.80 → 4364.58] By softening
[4364.58 → 4365.48] the offence
[4365.48 → 4367.46] of God using shepherds,
[4367.46 → 4369.04] we make the messenger
[4369.04 → 4370.02] more important
[4370.02 → 4370.84] than the message.
[4371.86 → 4374.14] And the message
[4374.14 → 4375.84] is for all.
[4376.64 → 4378.54] By taking the scandal
[4378.54 → 4379.52] out of God
[4379.52 → 4380.74] using shepherds,
[4380.86 → 4382.22] we are in fact
[4382.22 → 4383.66] making God smaller.
[4383.82 → 4384.42] We are in fact
[4384.42 → 4385.08] trying to put him
[4385.08 → 4385.62] in a box
[4385.62 → 4386.56] that we can comprehend
[4386.56 → 4387.46] and that we are
[4387.46 → 4388.22] comfortable with.
[4388.22 → 4389.06] We are trying
[4389.06 → 4389.74] to determine
[4389.74 → 4391.02] who this message
[4391.02 → 4391.74] is for
[4391.74 → 4392.94] and who can
[4392.94 → 4393.76] properly speak
[4393.76 → 4395.04] this message
[4395.04 → 4396.64] in the world.
[4399.08 → 4399.70] Look,
[4400.50 → 4404.86] this may be
[4404.86 → 4405.94] controversial,
[4407.00 → 4407.80] this may push
[4407.80 → 4408.58] some of your buttons,
[4409.32 → 4410.54] but I want to suggest
[4410.54 → 4410.98] to you
[4410.98 → 4413.28] that part of the reason
[4413.28 → 4415.22] why so many of you
[4415.22 → 4416.12] find it hard
[4416.12 → 4417.38] to talk about Jesus,
[4418.46 → 4419.42] why so many of you
[4419.42 → 4420.22] find it hard
[4420.22 → 4421.06] to tell your
[4421.06 → 4422.00] unbelieving friends
[4422.00 → 4422.62] the truth
[4422.62 → 4423.52] of the gospel
[4423.52 → 4424.36] is because you
[4424.36 → 4425.00] have settled
[4425.00 → 4426.32] for a hallmarked
[4426.32 → 4426.86] Christianity.
[4428.40 → 4429.38] You have settled
[4429.38 → 4430.94] for a small Christ.
[4432.44 → 4434.16] The only reason
[4434.16 → 4435.30] anyone can be
[4435.30 → 4435.90] indifferent
[4435.90 → 4436.90] about Jesus
[4436.90 → 4438.82] is if they're not
[4438.82 → 4439.38] looking at the
[4439.38 → 4440.14] Jesus of the Bible.
[4440.14 → 4444.48] If Jesus is
[4444.48 → 4445.18] who he says
[4445.18 → 4445.68] he is,
[4446.26 → 4447.34] if Jesus is
[4447.34 → 4447.96] who the Bible
[4447.96 → 4449.00] reveals him to be,
[4449.24 → 4450.54] you cannot have
[4450.54 → 4451.22] a tepid
[4451.22 → 4452.28] or lukewarm
[4452.28 → 4453.28] response to him.
[4453.48 → 4454.54] You cannot be
[4454.54 → 4455.12] indifferent.
[4457.58 → 4458.36] John Stott
[4458.36 → 4459.74] in his book
[4459.74 → 4460.84] Basic Christianity
[4460.84 → 4461.60] puts it this way.
[4461.68 → 4462.08] He says,
[4462.90 → 4464.54] if you read
[4464.54 → 4465.16] the Bible,
[4465.54 → 4466.10] you'll see
[4466.10 → 4466.82] that nobody
[4466.82 → 4467.56] who ever met
[4467.56 → 4467.90] Jesus
[4467.90 → 4468.56] had a moderate
[4468.56 → 4469.42] reaction to him.
[4470.14 → 4471.24] There are only
[4471.24 → 4472.16] three reactions
[4472.16 → 4472.74] to Jesus.
[4473.44 → 4474.10] They either
[4474.10 → 4474.70] hated him
[4474.70 → 4475.10] and wanted
[4475.10 → 4475.72] to kill him.
[4476.38 → 4477.36] They were afraid
[4477.36 → 4477.72] of him
[4477.72 → 4478.02] and wanted
[4478.02 → 4478.58] to run away
[4478.58 → 4479.02] from him.
[4479.42 → 4480.32] Or they were
[4480.32 → 4481.42] absolutely smitten
[4481.42 → 4481.88] with him
[4481.88 → 4482.56] and they tried
[4482.56 → 4483.00] to give
[4483.00 → 4483.94] their whole lives
[4483.94 → 4484.80] to him.
[4487.10 → 4487.98] But so many
[4487.98 → 4488.44] of you
[4488.44 → 4489.06] are willing
[4489.06 → 4489.92] to just accept
[4489.92 → 4490.60] meh
[4490.60 → 4491.90] when it comes
[4491.90 → 4492.48] to Jesus.
[4493.84 → 4495.02] Stop accepting
[4495.02 → 4495.56] meh.
[4495.82 → 4496.54] Stop accepting
[4496.54 → 4497.10] half measure.
[4497.24 → 4497.90] Stop accepting
[4497.90 → 4498.48] indifference
[4498.48 → 4499.58] as the normal
[4499.58 → 4500.22] experience
[4500.22 → 4500.66] of your
[4500.66 → 4501.46] relationship
[4501.46 → 4502.06] to God.
[4502.64 → 4503.48] Look at what
[4503.48 → 4504.48] Jesus himself
[4504.48 → 4505.34] had to go
[4505.34 → 4505.92] through in order
[4505.92 → 4506.86] to get to you.
[4507.78 → 4508.62] The eternal
[4508.62 → 4509.66] second person
[4509.66 → 4510.40] of the Trinity,
[4510.72 → 4511.66] God of God
[4511.66 → 4512.52] and true God
[4512.52 → 4513.38] of true God,
[4513.96 → 4515.12] emptied himself
[4515.12 → 4516.04] and took
[4516.04 → 4517.16] on flesh.
[4518.94 → 4519.50] Emmanuel,
[4519.96 → 4521.30] God with us,
[4521.54 → 4522.80] he emptied himself.
[4523.06 → 4524.34] He left the realms
[4524.34 → 4524.94] of glory
[4524.94 → 4525.60] and the presence
[4525.60 → 4526.12] of Father
[4526.12 → 4527.16] and the eternal
[4527.16 → 4528.02] loving fellowship
[4528.02 → 4528.70] that he and the
[4528.70 → 4529.56] Father shared
[4529.56 → 4530.38] with the Holy Spirit.
[4530.66 → 4531.86] He emptied himself
[4531.86 → 4532.82] and became
[4532.82 → 4533.96] as a slave
[4533.96 → 4535.32] taking on
[4535.32 → 4536.10] flesh.
[4536.26 → 4536.84] Emmanuel,
[4537.46 → 4538.84] God with us.
[4539.70 → 4540.92] God with us,
[4541.16 → 4542.46] but nobody
[4542.46 → 4543.48] recognized him.
[4544.28 → 4545.36] God with us,
[4545.44 → 4545.96] but we hung
[4545.96 → 4546.82] him on a cross.
[4547.24 → 4548.08] God with us,
[4548.16 → 4548.86] and we killed
[4548.86 → 4549.10] him.
[4550.40 → 4551.62] He did that,
[4551.62 → 4553.14] all of that,
[4553.42 → 4554.08] willingly
[4554.08 → 4557.14] to save
[4557.14 → 4558.20] for himself
[4558.20 → 4559.16] a bride.
[4560.38 → 4561.08] And now,
[4561.24 → 4561.88] by grace
[4561.88 → 4562.56] through faith,
[4562.62 → 4563.28] if you believe,
[4563.54 → 4564.30] you are
[4564.30 → 4565.32] that bride.
[4566.08 → 4566.68] Look at what
[4566.68 → 4567.36] he did,
[4567.60 → 4567.94] look at what
[4567.94 → 4568.74] he endured,
[4569.02 → 4569.36] look at what
[4569.36 → 4570.22] he went through,
[4570.42 → 4571.46] what he left behind,
[4571.70 → 4572.48] the pain that he
[4572.48 → 4573.36] bore in order
[4573.36 → 4574.50] to get to you.
[4576.40 → 4577.12] And you're
[4577.12 → 4577.82] going to sit here
[4577.82 → 4578.30] and settle
[4578.30 → 4578.96] for meh,
[4578.96 → 4581.90] for indifference.
[4583.68 → 4584.48] What are you
[4584.48 → 4585.28] doing to get
[4585.28 → 4585.74] to him?
[4588.52 → 4589.16] For some of you,
[4589.36 → 4590.62] coming to church
[4590.62 → 4591.06] either here
[4591.06 → 4591.68] or participating
[4591.68 → 4592.14] online,
[4592.46 → 4593.32] once a week
[4593.32 → 4593.98] is too much
[4593.98 → 4594.46] to ask.
[4594.54 → 4594.76] Really?
[4596.50 → 4597.10] Getting up
[4597.10 → 4597.54] on time
[4597.54 → 4598.04] to do
[4598.04 → 4599.10] personal devotions
[4599.10 → 4599.82] is too hard.
[4599.90 → 4600.40] It's too much
[4600.40 → 4600.82] to ask.
[4600.90 → 4601.12] Really?
[4602.72 → 4603.38] Reading your
[4603.38 → 4604.16] Bible is too
[4604.16 → 4604.70] much work.
[4605.60 → 4606.14] The very
[4606.14 → 4606.98] place where
[4606.98 → 4607.56] you are
[4607.56 → 4608.18] promised
[4608.18 → 4608.56] that you
[4608.56 → 4609.04] will hear
[4609.04 → 4609.56] the voice
[4609.56 → 4610.04] of Jesus
[4610.04 → 4610.74] without fail
[4610.74 → 4611.56] every single
[4611.56 → 4611.84] time.
[4612.00 → 4612.56] Right here,
[4612.78 → 4613.34] he's waiting
[4613.34 → 4613.88] for you.
[4616.04 → 4616.66] And you
[4616.66 → 4617.18] can't get up
[4617.18 → 4617.64] half an hour
[4617.64 → 4618.12] earlier to
[4618.12 → 4618.38] make it
[4618.38 → 4618.68] happen.
[4619.48 → 4620.12] That's too
[4620.12 → 4620.38] hard.
[4622.92 → 4623.38] You're too
[4623.38 → 4624.02] scared to
[4624.02 → 4624.74] pull your
[4624.74 → 4625.26] Bible out
[4625.26 → 4626.12] at lunch
[4626.12 → 4626.80] in the
[4626.80 → 4627.62] lunchroom
[4627.62 → 4629.12] because of
[4629.12 → 4629.74] what someone
[4629.74 → 4630.34] beside you
[4630.34 → 4630.76] might say.
[4632.40 → 4633.00] You're too
[4633.00 → 4633.52] worried about
[4633.52 → 4633.92] the opinion
[4633.92 → 4634.26] of this
[4634.26 → 4634.82] person to
[4634.82 → 4636.06] inject Jesus
[4636.06 → 4637.30] into a
[4637.30 → 4637.80] conversation.
[4638.18 → 4639.58] look at
[4639.58 → 4640.06] what Jesus
[4640.06 → 4640.68] did to
[4640.68 → 4641.08] get to
[4641.08 → 4641.48] you.
[4642.58 → 4642.90] What are
[4642.90 → 4643.50] you doing
[4643.50 → 4643.86] to get
[4643.86 → 4644.34] close to
[4644.34 → 4644.58] him?
[4646.72 → 4647.44] Tim Keller
[4647.44 → 4648.52] summarizes
[4648.52 → 4649.66] John Stott.
[4649.76 → 4649.96] He is
[4649.96 → 4650.68] reflecting on
[4650.68 → 4651.38] John Stott,
[4651.44 → 4651.78] that quote
[4651.78 → 4652.04] that I
[4652.04 → 4652.46] mentioned
[4652.46 → 4652.86] earlier.
[4653.70 → 4654.06] And he
[4654.06 → 4655.00] narrows it
[4655.00 → 4655.32] down even
[4655.32 → 4655.48] more.
[4655.54 → 4655.86] He has an
[4655.86 → 4656.28] even more
[4656.28 → 4657.04] convicting
[4657.04 → 4657.36] way.
[4657.46 → 4657.74] He says,
[4657.84 → 4658.16] the only
[4658.16 → 4658.58] way to
[4658.58 → 4659.14] respond to
[4659.14 → 4659.58] the gospel,
[4659.72 → 4660.02] to meeting
[4660.02 → 4660.38] Jesus,
[4660.58 → 4660.82] is
[4660.82 → 4661.78] extremely.
[4663.04 → 4663.24] Right?
[4663.30 → 4663.94] One way or
[4663.94 → 4664.34] the other.
[4664.56 → 4665.00] It'll be
[4665.00 → 4665.38] extreme.
[4665.38 → 4666.66] We'll be
[4666.66 → 4666.92] shouting,
[4667.04 → 4667.78] crucify him
[4667.78 → 4668.16] like the
[4668.16 → 4668.52] crowds,
[4668.64 → 4668.98] or we
[4668.98 → 4669.30] will be
[4669.30 → 4669.58] shouting,
[4669.72 → 4670.16] my Lord
[4670.16 → 4670.78] and my
[4670.78 → 4671.20] God,
[4671.28 → 4672.12] like Thomas
[4672.12 → 4672.50] when he
[4672.50 → 4673.22] touched his
[4673.22 → 4674.16] hands and
[4674.16 → 4675.20] his thighs.
[4676.04 → 4676.40] Look at
[4676.40 → 4677.08] the shepherds.
[4678.56 → 4679.02] Look at the
[4679.02 → 4679.54] shepherds.
[4680.94 → 4681.90] Verse 17.
[4682.06 → 4682.50] When they
[4682.50 → 4683.16] had seen
[4683.16 → 4683.46] him,
[4683.58 → 4684.14] they spread
[4684.14 → 4685.08] word concerning
[4685.08 → 4685.78] what had
[4685.78 → 4686.42] been told
[4686.42 → 4687.24] them about
[4687.24 → 4688.44] this child.
[4688.56 → 4689.14] And all
[4689.14 → 4689.66] who heard
[4689.66 → 4689.98] it were
[4689.98 → 4690.78] amazed at
[4690.78 → 4691.16] what the
[4691.16 → 4691.66] shepherds
[4691.66 → 4692.48] had said
[4692.48 → 4692.86] to them.
[4692.86 → 4694.52] The most
[4694.52 → 4695.92] unlikely of
[4695.92 → 4696.36] witnesses
[4696.36 → 4697.96] couldn't
[4697.96 → 4699.54] help but
[4699.54 → 4700.00] witness.
[4702.24 → 4703.04] The
[4703.04 → 4703.84] impossible
[4703.84 → 4705.54] speaker of
[4705.54 → 4706.24] truth and
[4706.24 → 4706.88] testimony
[4706.88 → 4707.52] couldn't
[4707.52 → 4708.20] help but
[4708.20 → 4709.04] speak truth
[4709.04 → 4709.60] and live
[4709.60 → 4710.52] a testimony.
[4714.36 → 4715.42] No matter
[4715.42 → 4715.94] who you
[4715.94 → 4716.34] are,
[4717.34 → 4719.44] if you
[4719.44 → 4721.62] are a
[4721.62 → 4722.52] disciple of
[4722.52 → 4722.86] Jesus,
[4722.86 → 4723.48] if you
[4723.48 → 4724.16] have met
[4724.16 → 4724.94] him and
[4724.94 → 4725.62] been met
[4725.62 → 4727.04] by him,
[4728.04 → 4729.86] you can't
[4729.86 → 4732.00] help but
[4732.00 → 4732.62] speak his
[4732.62 → 4732.96] name,
[4733.96 → 4734.86] proclaim his
[4734.86 → 4735.96] gospel,
[4736.40 → 4737.30] tell his
[4737.30 → 4738.24] story.
[4739.86 → 4740.76] And then
[4740.76 → 4741.74] look at the
[4741.74 → 4742.20] shepherds.
[4742.30 → 4742.82] The shepherds
[4742.82 → 4743.36] returned,
[4743.52 → 4744.04] verse 20,
[4744.46 → 4745.56] glorifying and
[4745.56 → 4746.46] praising God
[4746.46 → 4747.40] for all the
[4747.40 → 4747.96] things that
[4747.96 → 4748.68] they had heard
[4748.68 → 4749.40] and seen,
[4750.00 → 4750.40] which were
[4750.40 → 4751.06] just as
[4751.06 → 4752.06] they had
[4752.06 → 4752.52] been told.
[4755.40 → 4756.08] Truly
[4756.08 → 4756.82] witnessing
[4756.82 → 4760.36] always leads
[4760.36 → 4761.78] to worship.
[4763.84 → 4764.82] So stop
[4764.82 → 4765.74] settling for
[4765.74 → 4766.48] less than
[4766.48 → 4766.96] the real
[4766.96 → 4767.40] thing.
[4768.32 → 4768.80] Don't let
[4768.80 → 4769.48] indifference
[4769.48 → 4770.24] define your
[4770.24 → 4770.64] faith.
[4771.04 → 4771.40] Don't let
[4771.40 → 4771.96] a mere
[4771.96 → 4772.90] sentimentality
[4772.90 → 4773.62] define your
[4773.62 → 4774.48] Advent and
[4774.48 → 4775.00] your Christmas.
[4775.36 → 4775.94] If you are
[4775.94 → 4776.72] in the depths
[4776.72 → 4777.54] this week,
[4777.86 → 4778.74] cry out to
[4778.74 → 4779.34] your Saviour.
[4779.66 → 4780.04] If you are
[4780.04 → 4780.30] at the
[4780.30 → 4781.12] heights this
[4781.12 → 4781.34] week,
[4781.52 → 4782.40] worship the
[4782.40 → 4783.42] real Jesus.
[4783.74 → 4784.58] Stop settling
[4784.58 → 4785.20] for a mere
[4785.20 → 4786.16] sentimentality but
[4786.16 → 4787.76] long, long and
[4787.76 → 4788.86] journey towards
[4788.86 → 4789.88] and come to
[4789.88 → 4790.50] God in his
[4790.50 → 4790.78] word.
[4791.16 → 4791.78] Come to God
[4791.78 → 4792.56] in prayer and
[4792.56 → 4793.44] in worship and
[4793.44 → 4793.96] in devotion.
[4794.68 → 4795.90] Long for a
[4795.90 → 4797.20] deep affection
[4797.20 → 4798.72] to him.
[4798.72 → 4801.02] and then
[4801.02 → 4803.18] whether you
[4803.18 → 4803.78] are on the
[4803.78 → 4804.92] mountaintops or
[4804.92 → 4805.94] in the coffee
[4805.94 → 4806.70] shops, whether
[4806.70 → 4807.20] you are at
[4807.20 → 4808.00] work or at
[4808.00 → 4808.52] school, whether
[4808.52 → 4808.98] you are around
[4808.98 → 4809.74] the dining
[4809.74 → 4810.66] table or the
[4810.66 → 4811.38] poker table,
[4811.38 → 4812.44] be the
[4812.44 → 4813.70] unlikely witness.
[4816.20 → 4817.06] In the
[4817.06 → 4817.70] hallmarked
[4817.70 → 4819.68] story of the
[4819.68 → 4822.76] shepherds, or
[4822.76 → 4823.70] the hallmarked
[4823.70 → 4824.40] story of the
[4824.40 → 4825.26] shepherds, tells
[4825.26 → 4826.22] us that
[4826.22 → 4828.98] everyone, however
[4828.98 → 4829.96] unlikely it may
[4829.96 → 4831.34] seem, is a
[4831.34 → 4832.56] witness for the
[4832.56 → 4832.94] gospel.
[4834.22 → 4834.98] And like the
[4834.98 → 4835.74] shepherds at the
[4835.74 → 4836.42] beginning of the
[4836.42 → 4837.26] story, like the
[4837.26 → 4838.18] women at the
[4838.18 → 4838.76] end of the
[4838.76 → 4839.48] story, it is
[4839.48 → 4840.68] now your turn
[4840.68 → 4842.82] to tell this
[4842.82 → 4844.96] Christmas story.
[4846.24 → 4846.88] Go.
[4848.16 → 4849.08] Tell the
[4849.08 → 4850.98] true story of
[4850.98 → 4851.68] the real
[4851.68 → 4853.28] Jesus this
[4853.28 → 4854.32] Christmas.
[4855.02 → 4855.32] Amen?
[4856.32 → 4856.88] Amen.
[4857.22 → 4857.60] Let's pray
[4857.60 → 4857.90] together.
[4869.48 → 4870.46] Heavenly Father,
[4871.24 → 4873.08] we gather
[4873.08 → 4876.52] now sent
[4876.52 → 4877.86] into the
[4877.86 → 4878.76] world as
[4878.76 → 4879.28] your
[4879.28 → 4880.44] witnesses.
[4881.68 → 4882.64] captivate
[4882.64 → 4884.24] our hearts,
[4884.52 → 4885.50] stir our
[4885.50 → 4886.64] affections,
[4886.80 → 4887.82] overwhelm our
[4887.82 → 4888.90] imaginations for
[4888.90 → 4889.62] the possibilities
[4889.62 → 4890.64] of you at
[4890.64 → 4891.34] work in the
[4891.34 → 4892.08] world through
[4892.08 → 4893.16] each one of
[4893.16 → 4894.18] us, unlikely
[4894.18 → 4895.40] witnesses though
[4895.40 → 4896.84] we may be.
[4902.40 → 4903.26] In a
[4903.26 → 4905.36] world that
[4905.36 → 4905.62] would have
[4905.62 → 4906.58] dismissed the
[4906.58 → 4909.02] shepherds, in
[4909.02 → 4909.52] a world that
[4909.52 → 4909.90] would have had
[4909.90 → 4911.16] animosity for
[4911.16 → 4911.44] them,
[4911.68 → 4912.78] in a world
[4912.78 → 4913.42] that would not
[4913.42 → 4914.28] believe what
[4914.28 → 4915.62] they say, they
[4915.62 → 4916.72] couldn't help
[4916.72 → 4918.94] but witness and
[4918.94 → 4919.32] worship.
[4920.96 → 4921.84] And so, Lord
[4921.84 → 4922.66] God, may we
[4922.66 → 4924.02] to be the
[4924.02 → 4924.72] same having
[4924.72 → 4926.12] met you here.
[4926.96 → 4927.70] May we too be
[4927.70 → 4928.44] the same having
[4928.44 → 4929.50] met you in our
[4929.50 → 4930.42] worship each
[4930.42 → 4931.62] week, having
[4931.62 → 4932.84] met you in our
[4932.84 → 4934.22] devotion, in our
[4934.22 → 4934.72] study.
[4935.12 → 4936.56] May we too
[4936.56 → 4939.18] witness and
[4939.18 → 4939.54] worship.
[4939.54 → 4939.68] worship.
[4941.44 → 4942.20] May we too
[4942.20 → 4944.72] proclaim glory
[4944.72 → 4945.72] to God in the
[4945.72 → 4946.46] the highest heaven
[4946.46 → 4947.44] and on earth,
[4947.82 → 4948.76] peace to those
[4948.76 → 4949.82] on whom his
[4949.82 → 4951.40] favour rests.
[4951.40 → 4953.58] Amen.
[4953.58 → 4966.00] Lord of the depths, I
[4966.00 → 4970.90] cried to you on high, the
[4970.90 → 4972.74] Lord of the depths, I cry to you on high.
[4972.74 → 4987.02] Lord of the depths, I cry to you on high, Lord, here I call.
[4987.02 → 4998.68] Lend down your ear and listen to my sigh for giving all.
[4998.68 → 5014.32] If you should mark our sins to send this hand, but grace and mercy dwell at your right hand.
[5014.32 → 5015.32] Lord of the depths, I cry to you on high, the way to hear.
[5015.32 → 5026.74] I wait for God, my trust is holy word, he hears my sighs.
[5026.74 → 5034.20] My soul still waits and looks unto the Lord.
[5034.74 → 5038.48] My prayers arise.
[5039.26 → 5046.26] I look for Him to drive away my mind.
[5046.26 → 5054.38] Yes, more than those who watch for morning night.
[5054.38 → 5063.40] Hope in the Lord, unfailing is His love.
[5063.84 → 5067.46] In Him confide.
[5068.46 → 5075.28] Mercy and hope, redemption from above.
[5075.28 → 5079.34] He does provide.
[5079.34 → 5087.14] From sin and evil, mighty though they seem.
[5087.64 → 5094.54] His arm almighty will His saints redeem.
[5094.54 → 5114.22] As you go this week, you go as witnesses of our God.
[5114.22 → 5122.60] God Himself goes with you so that you might boldly proclaim His gospel truth to the world.
[5123.50 → 5126.12] Receive God's blessing as you go.
[5129.18 → 5132.32] May God go before you to lead you.
[5132.92 → 5135.70] May God go behind you to guard you.
[5136.08 → 5138.66] May God go beneath you to support you.
[5138.66 → 5141.56] And may God go beside you to befriend you.
[5141.86 → 5143.98] Do not be afraid.
[5144.88 → 5146.94] Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[5147.04 → 5148.54] Do not be afraid.
[5148.92 → 5155.70] But go in peace to love, serve, and boldly proclaim the Lord.
[5156.76 → 5157.28] Amen.
[5157.28 → 5157.42] Amen.
[5168.66 → 5172.34] And Lord Jesus Christ.
[5174.58 → 5175.98] Amen.
[5175.98 → 5183.36] The word of God has become flesh
[5183.36 → 5189.70] Unto us a child is born
[5189.70 → 5195.98] The Saviour of a broken world
[5195.98 → 5201.98] Hear the angel voices
[5201.98 → 5208.98] Sing, come, let us adore you
[5209.60 → 5218.98] Peace has come for our King is with us

[5241.16 → 5247.34] All praise belongs to Christ alone
