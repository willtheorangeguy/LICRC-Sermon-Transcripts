[0.00 --> 29.98]  Thank you.
[30.00 --> 59.98]  Thank you.
[60.00 --> 89.98]  Thank you.
[90.00 --> 92.00]  Thank you.
[120.00 --> 122.00]  Thank you.
[150.00 --> 152.00]  Thank you.
[180.00 --> 182.00]  Thank you.
[210.00 --> 212.00]  Thank you.
[212.00 --> 218.00]  Hold up your hand, keep pressing on.
[218.00 --> 222.00]  We are almost home.
[222.00 --> 226.00]  Almost home.
[226.00 --> 230.00]  Almost home.
[230.00 --> 232.00]  Whoa.
[232.00 --> 234.00]  Whoa.
[234.00 --> 239.00]  I know that the cross has brought heaven to us.
[239.00 --> 242.00]  Make no mistake, there's still more to come.
[242.00 --> 246.00]  When our flesh and our bones are no longer between.
[246.00 --> 250.00]  We are right now and where we're meant to be.
[250.00 --> 253.00]  Well, all that's been lost is made whole again.
[253.00 --> 257.00]  These tears and this pain no longer exists.
[257.00 --> 258.00]  No more walking.
[258.00 --> 261.00]  We're running as fast as we can.
[261.00 --> 262.00]  Consider this.
[262.00 --> 267.00]  I'm saying we're almost home.
[267.00 --> 271.00]  Brother, it won't be alone.
[271.00 --> 277.00]  Soon all your burdens will be gone.
[277.00 --> 285.00]  With all your strength, sister, run wild, run free.
[285.00 --> 293.00]  Hold up your hand, keep pressing on.
[293.00 --> 295.00]  We are almost home.
[295.00 --> 297.00]  Almost home.
[297.00 --> 299.00]  Almost home.
[299.00 --> 301.00]  Almost home.
[301.00 --> 323.00]  Almost home.
[331.00 --> 343.38]  On the nights when the dark lasts a little bit longer
[343.38 --> 349.72]  When the wind and the storm is a little bit stronger
[349.72 --> 356.22]  When the fear in my heart digs a little bit deeper
[356.22 --> 362.62]  When my faith just ain't, it's a little bit weaker
[362.62 --> 370.36]  Where could I run to? Where could I go?
[386.22 --> 396.26]  The start of the gospel movement that would become the church
[396.26 --> 398.58]  Oh, okay
[398.58 --> 399.98]  Say when
[399.98 --> 404.90]  Good morning, take two
[404.90 --> 408.80]  Thanks for joining us this morning together in worship
[408.80 --> 411.50]  Today is a special Sunday, it is Pentecost
[411.50 --> 413.94]  Where we mark the coming of the Holy Spirit
[413.94 --> 420.22]  And so today it's my hope and prayer that we will worship in spirit and in truth together
[420.22 --> 424.00]  My name is Chris, I'm one of the pastors here at Langley Emanuel
[424.00 --> 428.00]  And it's my privilege along with those on stage and at the back
[428.00 --> 430.68]  To lead you in worship this morning
[430.68 --> 434.30]  Before we begin in earnest with song and prayer together
[434.30 --> 435.82]  Just one announcement
[435.82 --> 439.08]  And I'm sure many of you are aware of this already
[439.08 --> 442.48]  But on Tuesday here in BC
[442.48 --> 447.90]  The circuit breaker COVID restrictions that we are currently under are coming to an end
[447.90 --> 449.82]  And there will be new protocols issued
[449.82 --> 451.34]  And we are hopeful
[451.34 --> 454.00]  Loosely holding on to that hope of course
[454.00 --> 459.62]  But we are hopeful that that will include some opportunities for gathered worship once again
[459.62 --> 464.18]  And so you can anticipate on Tuesday following that announcement
[464.18 --> 466.50]  An announcement from church offices here
[466.50 --> 469.04]  Clarifying what that process will be like
[469.04 --> 473.20]  And how we will start that chance to regather again
[473.20 --> 477.10]  And so you can look for the sign-up lists and everything to come from the office
[477.10 --> 481.44]  On Tuesday evening after we have a chance to hear what the announcement is
[481.44 --> 487.32]  And make our plans in accordance and in align with what we are able to do
[487.32 --> 488.60]  And so keep that ready
[488.60 --> 491.84]  Keep your eye out for that email to come out
[491.84 --> 494.54]  And that announcement for that chance for us to worship
[494.54 --> 496.50]  As we gather together this morning
[496.50 --> 498.76]  I invite you to open your heart
[498.76 --> 502.02]  Whether you stand or take a posture of your hands out
[502.02 --> 507.42]  To receive the greeting of God who meets us together in worship
[507.42 --> 513.76]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father
[513.76 --> 518.32]  From the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Savior
[518.32 --> 523.12]  And through the indwelling presence and power of the Holy Spirit
[523.12 --> 524.62]  Amen
[524.62 --> 526.38]  Let's worship God this morning
[526.38 --> 536.38]  Spirit of the living God
[536.38 --> 540.44]  Visit us again on this day of Pentecost
[540.44 --> 543.36]  Come, Holy Spirit
[543.36 --> 548.26]  With rushing wind that sweeps away all barriers
[548.26 --> 552.28]  Come, Holy Spirit
[552.28 --> 557.62]  With tongues of fire that set our hearts aflame
[557.62 --> 560.48]  Come, Holy Spirit
[560.48 --> 565.14]  With speech that unites the babble of our tongues
[565.14 --> 568.02]  Come, Holy Spirit
[568.02 --> 573.50]  With love that overlaps the boundaries of race and nation
[573.50 --> 576.40]  Come, Holy Spirit
[576.40 --> 581.42]  With power from above to make our weakness strong
[581.42 --> 584.28]  Come, Holy Spirit
[584.28 --> 600.78]  Our Father everlasting
[600.78 --> 605.12]  The all-creating one
[605.12 --> 608.36]  God almighty
[608.36 --> 614.54]  Through your Holy Spirit
[614.54 --> 618.86]  Conceiving Christ the Son
[618.86 --> 622.00]  Jesus our Savior
[622.00 --> 627.78]  I believe in God our Father
[627.78 --> 631.42]  I believe in Christ the Son
[631.42 --> 634.42]  I believe in the Holy Spirit
[634.42 --> 638.38]  Our God is three in one
[638.38 --> 641.38]  I believe in the resurrection
[641.38 --> 645.08]  That we will rise again
[645.08 --> 651.26]  For I believe in the name of Jesus
[651.26 --> 668.44]  Our judge and our defender
[668.44 --> 671.54]  Suffered and crucified
[671.54 --> 677.58]  Forgiveness is in you
[677.58 --> 681.06]  Descended into darkness
[681.06 --> 685.06]  You rose in glorious life
[685.06 --> 689.48]  Forever seated high
[689.48 --> 694.56]  I believe in God our Father
[694.56 --> 697.98]  I believe in Christ the Son
[697.98 --> 701.16]  I believe in the Holy Spirit
[701.16 --> 704.64]  Our God is three in one
[704.64 --> 707.46]  I believe in the resurrection
[707.46 --> 711.12]  That we will rise again
[711.12 --> 717.12]  For I believe in the name of Jesus
[717.12 --> 725.08]  I believe in you
[725.08 --> 730.56]  I believe you rose again
[730.56 --> 741.56]  I believe that Jesus Christ is Lord
[741.56 --> 751.02]  I believe in you
[751.02 --> 757.32]  I believe you rose again.
[759.00 --> 767.00]  I believe that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[771.40 --> 775.66]  I believe in life eternal.
[776.30 --> 779.26]  I believe in the virgin birth.
[779.26 --> 782.50]  I believe in the saints communion.
[783.22 --> 786.22]  And in your holy church.
[786.56 --> 789.10]  I believe in the resurrection.
[789.88 --> 792.76]  When Jesus comes again.
[793.36 --> 798.84]  For I believe in the name of Jesus.
[799.96 --> 802.60]  I believe in God our Father.
[803.24 --> 805.92]  I believe in Christ the Son.
[805.92 --> 809.04]  I believe in the Holy Spirit.
[809.26 --> 812.54]  Our God is three in one.
[812.88 --> 815.38]  I believe in the resurrection.
[816.18 --> 818.88]  That we will rise again.
[819.44 --> 824.80]  For I believe in the name of Jesus.
[824.80 --> 831.36]  For I believe in the name of Jesus.
[831.36 --> 838.36]  For I believe in the name of Jesus.
[838.36 --> 839.76]  For I believe in the name of Jesus.
[839.76 --> 839.86]  For I believe in the name of Jesus.
[839.86 --> 842.16]  For I believe in the name of Jesus.
[842.16 --> 857.64]  For the God is one of thế
[857.64 --> 860.58]  comes to us from Titus 3 this morning.
[861.74 --> 867.00]  But when the kindness and love of God, our Savior, appeared,
[868.16 --> 873.10]  he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done,
[873.82 --> 875.66]  but because of his mercy.
[876.90 --> 881.14]  He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal
[881.14 --> 886.24]  by the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us generously
[886.24 --> 888.72]  through Jesus Christ, our Savior,
[889.72 --> 893.44]  so that, having been justified by his grace,
[894.02 --> 898.78]  we might become heirs, having the hope of eternal life.
[916.24 --> 933.72]  Holy Spirit, living breath of God,
[933.72 --> 939.20]  breathe new life into my willing soul.
[940.62 --> 952.60]  Bring the presence of the risen Lord to renew my heart and make me whole.
[952.60 --> 960.08]  Cause your word to come alive in me.
[960.08 --> 966.58]  Give me faith for what I cannot see.
[967.12 --> 972.40]  Give me passion for your purity.
[973.14 --> 978.80]  Holy Spirit, breathe new life in me.
[978.80 --> 986.54]  Holy Spirit, come abide within.
[986.54 --> 993.28]  Make your joy be seen in all I do.
[993.28 --> 999.62]  Love enough to cover every sin
[999.62 --> 1004.78]  in each thought and deed and attitude.
[1004.78 --> 1013.22]  Kindness to the greatest and the least.
[1014.52 --> 1019.56]  Gentleness that sows a pop of peace.
[1020.20 --> 1025.52]  Turn my striving into works of grace.
[1025.52 --> 1031.52]  Breath of God, show Christ in all I do.
[1031.52 --> 1033.52]  Breath of God, show Christ in all I do.
[1033.52 --> 1039.00]  Holy Spirit, from creation's birth,
[1039.00 --> 1045.20]  giving life to all that God has made.
[1045.20 --> 1052.18]  Show your power once again on earth.
[1052.18 --> 1058.84]  Cause your church to hunger for your ways.
[1058.84 --> 1066.04]  Let the fragrance of our prayers arise.
[1066.04 --> 1072.34]  Lead us on the road of sacrifice.
[1072.34 --> 1078.28]  That in unity the face of Christ
[1078.28 --> 1083.90]  may be clear for all the world to see.
[1083.90 --> 1085.90]  Let the fragrance of our prayers arise.
[1085.90 --> 1090.90]  Let the fragrance of our prayers arise.
[1090.90 --> 1097.90]  Lead us on the road of sacrifice.
[1097.90 --> 1104.62]  That in unity the face of Christ
[1104.62 --> 1110.90]  may be clear for all the world to see.
[1110.90 --> 1117.74]  Good morning.
[1118.14 --> 1119.36]  Welcome to Kids Corner.
[1119.76 --> 1120.38]  Hi kids.
[1120.58 --> 1121.86]  My name is Mr. Mike.
[1121.98 --> 1123.90]  I think many of you know who I am.
[1124.90 --> 1124.94]  Oh.
[1125.76 --> 1126.54]  Good morning.
[1126.72 --> 1127.52]  We'll go again.
[1127.66 --> 1128.82]  We're good at take two today.
[1129.36 --> 1130.50]  My name is Mr. Mike.
[1130.56 --> 1131.68]  And welcome to Kids Corner.
[1132.68 --> 1135.18]  Hey, last week you guys had a visit
[1135.18 --> 1137.62]  with Mr. Kevin and Hank the Hound.
[1137.62 --> 1140.86]  And we heard all about how the Holy Spirit
[1140.86 --> 1143.52]  has come down on God's people
[1143.52 --> 1147.58]  and is spreading his gift to all the nations of the world.
[1147.78 --> 1150.16]  Well, we're going to keep talking about that a little bit today.
[1150.40 --> 1152.12]  But first, before we get to the story
[1152.12 --> 1153.56]  and a little bit of a special activity,
[1153.96 --> 1158.08]  we are going to work on our memory verse from Isaiah.
[1158.08 --> 1166.42]  The Lord your God, who takes hold of your right hand,
[1166.94 --> 1168.38]  says to you,
[1168.78 --> 1170.22]  Do not fear.
[1170.60 --> 1172.78]  I will help you.
[1173.18 --> 1176.38]  Isaiah 41 verse 13.
[1180.74 --> 1181.70]  Thanks, guys.
[1181.82 --> 1182.44]  Good job.
[1182.66 --> 1184.36]  I think we're getting pretty good at that verse.
[1184.36 --> 1187.14]  Hey, I have a fun activity for you guys
[1187.14 --> 1189.26]  before we get into today's story.
[1189.88 --> 1192.08]  Now, I know you probably had breakfast.
[1192.30 --> 1193.06]  I hope you did.
[1193.58 --> 1194.68]  And I'm just wondering,
[1194.80 --> 1197.16]  maybe are you feeling a little bit hungry?
[1197.28 --> 1198.44]  Maybe you'd like a little snack?
[1198.84 --> 1201.22]  Do you need something to get through the rest of the service?
[1201.88 --> 1204.10]  Well, I've got some gifts here for you.
[1204.38 --> 1205.86]  Well, I'm going to start with this first bag.
[1206.40 --> 1206.92]  Here's a gift.
[1207.00 --> 1208.34]  Let's see what's in here for you guys.
[1209.80 --> 1210.04]  Oh.
[1210.04 --> 1210.36]  Oh.
[1211.56 --> 1211.96]  Oh.
[1211.96 --> 1215.32]  Nice, bright red.
[1215.48 --> 1216.32]  What do you think they are?
[1217.22 --> 1217.90]  Some tomatoes.
[1218.48 --> 1218.84]  Awesome.
[1219.46 --> 1220.08]  Well, there you go.
[1220.30 --> 1221.30]  There's some awesome tomatoes.
[1221.86 --> 1223.96]  You can make some salsa with that.
[1224.20 --> 1226.40]  You could slice it up with maybe some salt.
[1226.70 --> 1227.40]  That'd be lovely.
[1228.12 --> 1228.90]  And then,
[1229.40 --> 1230.86]  is that going to be enough food, you think?
[1231.08 --> 1231.84]  Do you like tomatoes?
[1233.00 --> 1234.20]  That's maybe not quite enough.
[1234.30 --> 1235.10]  Hey, I have an idea.
[1235.22 --> 1237.04]  How about I trade you?
[1237.74 --> 1238.68]  Would you do that?
[1238.68 --> 1240.64]  What if I take back the tomatoes?
[1241.48 --> 1243.62]  And what if you have this gift?
[1244.70 --> 1245.62]  Is that a good idea?
[1245.88 --> 1246.60]  Are you in for that?
[1247.20 --> 1248.04]  Okay, let's try that.
[1248.30 --> 1249.82]  Okay, so I'll take back the tomatoes.
[1250.32 --> 1252.42]  And here is this.
[1252.58 --> 1254.06]  Do you know what's in here?
[1255.30 --> 1257.36]  Are you maybe taking a bit of a chance?
[1257.72 --> 1258.68]  Well, let's see what's in here.
[1258.90 --> 1260.96]  What gifts have I brought for your snack now?
[1261.40 --> 1261.54]  Oh.
[1263.04 --> 1264.34]  Whole thing of carrots.
[1265.06 --> 1265.70]  What's this?
[1265.70 --> 1267.86]  Broccoli.
[1270.26 --> 1270.74]  Oh.
[1271.78 --> 1272.02]  Huh.
[1272.60 --> 1274.08]  Some more tomatoes.
[1274.74 --> 1275.22]  Oh, boy.
[1276.56 --> 1277.66]  Bunch of oranges.
[1278.74 --> 1279.48]  You guys like oranges?
[1281.20 --> 1282.12]  And lemon.
[1283.20 --> 1285.66]  Well, this is quite a cornucopia,
[1286.04 --> 1286.96]  as one might say.
[1287.20 --> 1288.98]  That's quite a plate of food, hey?
[1289.62 --> 1290.58]  That's quite an upgrade
[1290.58 --> 1292.38]  from those two measly tomatoes.
[1292.38 --> 1295.54]  I don't know if you love vegetables,
[1295.76 --> 1297.56]  but I know your mom and dad are going to be,
[1297.70 --> 1298.94]  or whoever's sitting with you right now,
[1299.00 --> 1301.04]  is pretty happy that you could have a whole plate
[1301.04 --> 1302.04]  of awesome veggies
[1302.04 --> 1304.26]  to get you through the day, right?
[1304.34 --> 1305.40]  You could make a salad.
[1305.88 --> 1307.30]  You could have them with dip.
[1307.72 --> 1309.12]  What a lovely meal that would be.
[1310.06 --> 1310.96]  Well, hey, guess what?
[1310.96 --> 1313.56]  I think I have another gift for you guys.
[1314.06 --> 1316.58]  Would you guys be in for yet one more gift?
[1317.74 --> 1318.74]  You might be thinking,
[1318.86 --> 1319.18]  I don't know,
[1319.22 --> 1320.34]  I don't want more vegetables.
[1321.20 --> 1323.42]  But let's go for the next gift.
[1323.94 --> 1328.74]  What could be in the third potential package?
[1330.40 --> 1331.24]  What is it?
[1332.00 --> 1333.26]  Did someone scream donuts?
[1333.66 --> 1333.78]  Yeah.
[1334.26 --> 1335.96]  Well, it's not that kind of sundae.
[1336.68 --> 1337.44]  Oh, what's this?
[1337.44 --> 1340.86]  Can you eat this?
[1342.64 --> 1343.98]  That doesn't taste very good.
[1344.18 --> 1344.82]  I shouldn't have done that.
[1345.06 --> 1345.92]  Hope I cleaned it good.
[1346.88 --> 1348.84]  Oh, what's this?
[1349.26 --> 1350.40]  Some containers.
[1352.26 --> 1355.50]  And, oh, well, what's in here?
[1356.28 --> 1357.18]  Oh, my goodness.
[1357.60 --> 1359.20]  A little watering can.
[1359.20 --> 1362.46]  And what else?
[1362.60 --> 1366.04]  Oh, a package of onion bulbs.
[1366.70 --> 1367.46]  Oh, my goodness.
[1368.78 --> 1369.70]  Oh, my goodness.
[1369.80 --> 1370.88]  There's so much stuff in here.
[1372.40 --> 1375.66]  Here's some seeds for some flowers.
[1376.40 --> 1380.54]  And more seeds for beets and spinach and lettuces.
[1380.54 --> 1384.40]  And, oh, here's some seeds for carrots.
[1385.46 --> 1386.60]  And what's this?
[1386.78 --> 1388.76]  Oh, a bunch of potatoes.
[1389.04 --> 1391.18]  I could probably cut these up and plant them.
[1391.86 --> 1392.44]  Oh, my goodness.
[1392.70 --> 1393.78]  The table's getting so full.
[1394.08 --> 1395.22]  There's only one bag.
[1396.24 --> 1397.22]  What's in here?
[1399.34 --> 1400.46]  Oaky smokes.
[1400.46 --> 1403.84]  We got whole plants coming out of the bag here.
[1404.38 --> 1405.34]  Look at this.
[1406.22 --> 1409.22]  Well, I think that was pretty smart of you guys to go for the third gift.
[1409.34 --> 1410.94]  Because look at this array.
[1411.04 --> 1412.50]  What can you do with all this stuff?
[1413.22 --> 1415.68]  Maybe you guys do this already with somebody this year.
[1416.08 --> 1418.10]  Did you plant yourself a bit of a garden?
[1418.26 --> 1421.30]  I think we could get a pretty awesome garden out of all this stuff.
[1421.70 --> 1421.92]  Huh?
[1421.92 --> 1425.44]  I mean, it's really good to enjoy these snacks up front.
[1425.58 --> 1430.40]  But, like, in the long run, we could have this awesome garden to enjoy.
[1431.06 --> 1431.96]  Well, that's pretty cool.
[1432.92 --> 1436.70]  Well, let's see how this kind of works with today's story.
[1436.76 --> 1438.04]  You know, I'll keep this stuff in front of me.
[1438.98 --> 1442.72]  And I'm going to read from the book of Acts.
[1443.26 --> 1446.58]  And we're going to hear a special story about Peter.
[1447.18 --> 1448.08]  Peter and John.
[1448.08 --> 1450.84]  So remember, the Holy Spirit has come.
[1451.12 --> 1454.60]  And now all the disciples and all of God's followers, Jesus' followers,
[1454.78 --> 1456.82]  are busy spreading his good news.
[1457.76 --> 1461.84]  So this book, or this story, is from the book of Acts, chapter 3.
[1463.90 --> 1466.00]  Peter heals the crippled beggar.
[1467.34 --> 1472.70]  One day, Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer.
[1472.70 --> 1480.02]  Now, a man crippled from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful,
[1480.84 --> 1485.88]  where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts.
[1486.62 --> 1491.32]  When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money.
[1493.46 --> 1497.08]  Peter looked straight at him, as did John.
[1497.70 --> 1499.50]  Then Peter said, look at us.
[1499.50 --> 1505.70]  So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them.
[1506.22 --> 1507.44]  Maybe a little money or something.
[1508.22 --> 1511.62]  Then Peter said, silver or gold, I do not have.
[1512.16 --> 1515.40]  But what I can give you, what I have, I give you.
[1515.72 --> 1518.90]  In the name of Jesus Christ, walk.
[1518.90 --> 1525.72]  Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up,
[1526.36 --> 1530.08]  and instantly the man's feet and ankles became strong.
[1530.44 --> 1533.50]  He jumped to his feet and began to walk.
[1534.52 --> 1539.70]  Then he went with them into the temple, walking and jumping and praising God.
[1539.70 --> 1543.12]  When all the people saw him walking and praising God,
[1543.34 --> 1548.98]  they recognized him as the same man who used to sit begging at the temple gate called Beautiful.
[1549.88 --> 1553.58]  And they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened.
[1555.26 --> 1560.94]  While the beggar held on to Peter and John, all the people were astonished and came running to the place.
[1561.68 --> 1563.52]  When Peter saw this, he said to them,
[1563.52 --> 1565.30]  Why does this surprise you?
[1565.96 --> 1571.20]  Why do you stare at us as if by our own power we had made this man walk?
[1571.84 --> 1577.20]  The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus.
[1578.56 --> 1579.56]  I'll skip ahead a little bit.
[1579.68 --> 1586.36]  By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see and know was made strong.
[1586.36 --> 1592.22]  It is Jesus' name and the faith that comes through him that has given this complete healing to him,
[1592.66 --> 1594.40]  as you can all see.
[1596.80 --> 1599.30]  It's kind of a little bit like this garden, right?
[1600.12 --> 1604.04]  Or our garden patch here, but the man just asked for something simple.
[1604.18 --> 1606.30]  He just asked for some money.
[1607.14 --> 1609.08]  But Peter and John said,
[1609.48 --> 1612.28]  We can help you out right now in even a better way.
[1612.78 --> 1615.22]  We can give you the ability to walk.
[1615.22 --> 1617.66]  So now he can get a job.
[1617.80 --> 1618.96]  He can see his family.
[1619.32 --> 1621.84]  He can do all kinds of things he could never do before.
[1622.48 --> 1625.34]  But even better yet, the man realized this too,
[1625.74 --> 1629.80]  and Peter and John made sure to mention that to all the people that were amazed,
[1630.34 --> 1632.60]  that there's a bigger investment going on.
[1632.66 --> 1636.36]  There's a bigger work going on, and all the glory goes to God in that.
[1636.78 --> 1641.88]  There's a full, full abundance for everybody in the long run with God, right?
[1641.94 --> 1643.62]  To glorify him in the big picture.
[1643.62 --> 1647.48]  So more than just walking, but life eternal that Jesus paid for us.
[1648.28 --> 1648.46]  Right?
[1648.56 --> 1649.34]  Does that make sense?
[1649.86 --> 1651.20]  Yeah, it's a crazy story.
[1651.32 --> 1652.72]  It is a cool, cool story.
[1652.98 --> 1653.90]  And I like that lesson.
[1654.04 --> 1655.98]  We usually think about, oh, wow, like,
[1656.78 --> 1660.70]  Jesus empowered Peter and John to help someone walk.
[1661.10 --> 1662.82]  But even bigger yet,
[1663.82 --> 1668.52]  that man was able to glorify God and give glory to God in a big, big way.
[1668.52 --> 1671.06]  So let's think about that this week.
[1671.14 --> 1673.56]  Let's think, what are some of the, like, little things?
[1673.64 --> 1676.50]  Maybe when we pray to God, we just ask for little things,
[1676.62 --> 1678.34]  and we ask for help for this,
[1678.46 --> 1680.18]  and we want to get through this in a day,
[1680.30 --> 1682.30]  and we want to be friends with so-and-so,
[1682.36 --> 1683.74]  and we thank God for our meals.
[1684.14 --> 1686.38]  Those are awesome things, and we should keep doing that.
[1686.98 --> 1688.10]  But let's also remember,
[1688.24 --> 1692.18]  there's a big way that we can glorify God in lots of little ways.
[1693.14 --> 1694.46]  Let's pray about that this morning.
[1696.78 --> 1700.06]  Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for this fantastic story.
[1700.38 --> 1704.14]  We thank you that Peter and John were there at the gate
[1704.14 --> 1707.62]  to be with this beggar and to bring you big glory, Lord.
[1708.14 --> 1710.44]  So we pray for the little things in our day today
[1710.44 --> 1713.24]  where we look to you and you bring us help and healing.
[1713.96 --> 1717.50]  And Lord, we also look to the big picture that you're unfolding for us,
[1717.54 --> 1718.98]  the big picture of salvation,
[1719.08 --> 1722.14]  and the big message you've asked us all to share.
[1723.18 --> 1725.30]  We pray for your help in this every day.
[1726.00 --> 1726.80]  In your name. Amen.
[1728.14 --> 1730.12]  Thanks, guys. We'll see you next week.
[1737.72 --> 1738.46]  Good morning.
[1739.44 --> 1740.32]  My name is Peter.
[1740.58 --> 1743.46]  I'm one of the elders here at Langley Emanuel.
[1744.82 --> 1747.48]  Before I get started with the offering,
[1747.48 --> 1750.02]  I did want to announce quickly,
[1750.16 --> 1752.26]  as you have seen in midweek memo,
[1752.64 --> 1754.44]  and you've also seen in the bulletin today
[1754.44 --> 1757.34]  that the nominations that council has put forward
[1757.34 --> 1759.64]  have been affirmed, which is great.
[1760.18 --> 1763.80]  Next week will be the drawing of lots
[1763.80 --> 1769.80]  for the replacement of the on council.
[1770.48 --> 1771.48]  That may happen.
[1772.24 --> 1774.36]  We've already got some plans in place in the current state
[1774.36 --> 1777.28]  to see how we're going to film that
[1777.28 --> 1778.92]  and put that in the live stream.
[1779.16 --> 1782.34]  But as Chris mentioned earlier,
[1782.86 --> 1788.00]  if we can meet here in the sanctuary next week,
[1788.10 --> 1790.60]  we will do that in the morning service,
[1790.60 --> 1791.92]  which will be the live stream service.
[1791.92 --> 1794.90]  So I'm hoping and praying for that.
[1797.32 --> 1799.36]  As members of Christ's family,
[1799.86 --> 1803.42]  we now set a time to give our tithes and our offerings.
[1804.80 --> 1807.44]  1 Timothy 6, 6-8 says,
[1807.68 --> 1810.54]  But true faith, with peace of mind,
[1811.58 --> 1812.64]  is of great profit.
[1813.56 --> 1815.38]  For we come into the world with nothing,
[1816.16 --> 1818.62]  and we are not able to take anything out.
[1818.62 --> 1822.54]  But if we have food and a roof over us,
[1823.18 --> 1824.14]  let that be enough.
[1826.00 --> 1828.02]  Tidia's offerings are first for the budget
[1828.02 --> 1830.84]  and second for the Ministry to Seafarers.
[1832.12 --> 1834.70]  Much of our day-to-day materials that we use
[1834.70 --> 1837.48]  travels thousands of miles to reach our hands.
[1838.10 --> 1840.60]  Many men and women spend countless days at sea,
[1841.18 --> 1842.92]  disconnected from family and friends,
[1843.12 --> 1846.82]  to make sure that those items arrive safely to us here
[1846.82 --> 1848.66]  in many various ports.
[1849.80 --> 1850.82]  Upon arrival at port,
[1851.04 --> 1852.28]  these men and women are physically,
[1852.74 --> 1854.32]  emotionally, and spiritually drained.
[1855.38 --> 1856.22]  It's at this point,
[1856.64 --> 1859.88]  the seafarers are warmly greeted by complete strangers.
[1860.84 --> 1863.12]  These strangers are the very hospitable people
[1863.12 --> 1865.30]  who work at the Ministry to Seafarers.
[1865.30 --> 1869.80]  Their mission is to help with the many burdens
[1869.80 --> 1871.48]  these seafarers encounter at sea,
[1872.02 --> 1874.90]  such as using Wi-Fi to connect to their families back home
[1874.90 --> 1876.82]  and restock on food supplies.
[1877.96 --> 1879.96]  Receiving the Word of God from many seafarers
[1879.96 --> 1881.66]  can be a life-changing experience.
[1882.72 --> 1883.34]  At the mission,
[1884.10 --> 1885.06]  they cannot do it alone.
[1885.78 --> 1886.50]  Please give today
[1886.50 --> 1889.04]  and change the life of many at sea.
[1890.20 --> 1893.80]  Next week's offering will be for CTE-N.
[1893.80 --> 1895.04]  As a reminder,
[1895.50 --> 1896.74]  during this difficult season,
[1897.02 --> 1898.76]  please refer to the midweek memo
[1898.76 --> 1899.60]  or the e-bulletin
[1899.60 --> 1901.32]  on the many different ways
[1901.32 --> 1902.70]  to give towards today's offerings.
[1903.28 --> 1904.30]  Please take time and pray
[1904.30 --> 1906.40]  and consider how much you can give
[1906.40 --> 1907.52]  towards today's offerings.
[1910.18 --> 1912.78]  Let's take time now to come together
[1912.78 --> 1914.40]  in our church family prayer.
[1915.16 --> 1915.94]  Let's pray.
[1915.94 --> 1923.48]  It is good to praise you, Lord.
[1924.48 --> 1927.50]  It is good to gaze upon your majesty,
[1927.90 --> 1930.18]  to proclaim your love in the morning
[1930.18 --> 1931.98]  and your faithfulness at night.
[1932.46 --> 1935.54]  It is good to worship and praise you.
[1936.50 --> 1937.56]  Father, to praise you
[1937.56 --> 1940.60]  is our privilege and our design.
[1940.60 --> 1943.74]  Let our worship honor your name
[1943.74 --> 1945.14]  from wherever we are.
[1945.78 --> 1946.70]  While we worship apart,
[1947.14 --> 1949.04]  let our collective voices come together
[1949.04 --> 1950.98]  as a pleasing aroma to you.
[1953.06 --> 1955.78]  We continue to feel both worried
[1955.78 --> 1958.46]  and encouraged about the pandemic situation.
[1958.68 --> 1961.60]  There's a drastic reduction in daily cases recently,
[1962.36 --> 1963.44]  which gives us some hope.
[1964.14 --> 1966.04]  But there are also still many
[1966.04 --> 1967.64]  who suffer or are affected.
[1967.64 --> 1971.40]  We think of schools and workplaces
[1971.40 --> 1972.92]  that have been closed temporarily.
[1973.80 --> 1975.62]  Many have had surgeries delayed.
[1976.46 --> 1978.32]  There are people in our medical system
[1978.32 --> 1980.16]  that are working long hours
[1980.16 --> 1981.40]  and seeing the effects
[1981.40 --> 1983.34]  of this disease on many people.
[1984.42 --> 1985.30]  We pray for healing
[1985.30 --> 1986.86]  and relief from suffering, Lord.
[1987.94 --> 1990.00]  We are also optimistically hopeful
[1990.00 --> 1991.04]  for what we will hear
[1991.04 --> 1992.44]  from health officials on Tuesday
[1992.44 --> 1995.18]  as we long to be able to come
[1995.18 --> 1996.84]  to worship together again.
[1997.64 --> 2001.36]  Lord, of course, COVID-19
[2001.36 --> 2002.70]  isn't the only thing going on.
[2002.96 --> 2004.90]  I mean, even though it gets
[2004.90 --> 2006.02]  almost all of our attention,
[2006.88 --> 2007.84]  there are many who suffer
[2007.84 --> 2008.82]  for different reasons.
[2009.68 --> 2010.96]  May they not be forgotten,
[2011.86 --> 2013.50]  whether they be from ailments,
[2014.28 --> 2015.26]  broken relationships,
[2015.72 --> 2016.52]  substance abuse,
[2016.60 --> 2018.20]  or any number of things.
[2018.78 --> 2020.06]  Grant that we may help each other
[2020.06 --> 2021.40]  in any way that we can,
[2021.76 --> 2023.62]  including laying our brothers and sisters
[2023.62 --> 2024.36]  at your feet,
[2024.36 --> 2027.26]  asking for your powerful hand
[2027.26 --> 2028.18]  to help them
[2028.18 --> 2029.68]  through their current situations.
[2032.32 --> 2033.28]  Lord, we are thankful
[2033.28 --> 2034.42]  for those who have let their names
[2034.42 --> 2035.30]  stand to serve
[2035.30 --> 2037.32]  in the offices of elder and deacon.
[2038.06 --> 2039.04]  Your church has affirmed
[2039.04 --> 2040.46]  the names we will draw lots from.
[2041.00 --> 2041.92]  May the lots cast
[2041.92 --> 2043.30]  be reflective of your will
[2043.30 --> 2044.82]  for who will be servants
[2044.82 --> 2045.86]  of your church next.
[2046.64 --> 2047.74]  We are also thankful
[2047.74 --> 2048.86]  for those who have served
[2048.86 --> 2050.58]  and are now ending their term
[2050.58 --> 2051.86]  and thankful for their
[2051.86 --> 2052.68]  faithful service.
[2054.28 --> 2055.06]  Lord, this morning,
[2055.14 --> 2055.98]  be with Pastor Chris
[2055.98 --> 2057.54]  as he delivers the message
[2057.54 --> 2058.86]  from your word to us today.
[2060.26 --> 2061.56]  May we not only hear
[2061.56 --> 2062.70]  what we are saying, Lord,
[2062.80 --> 2063.96]  but also act
[2063.96 --> 2065.48]  and do what we can
[2065.48 --> 2066.08]  in accordance
[2066.08 --> 2067.76]  with how you've asked us
[2067.76 --> 2068.56]  to respond.
[2070.24 --> 2071.04]  Thank you, Father.
[2071.04 --> 2072.56]  Amen.
[2078.86 --> 2085.34]  This morning,
[2085.46 --> 2087.14]  we're going to come together
[2087.14 --> 2090.10]  in reading God's word.
[2090.90 --> 2091.80]  We're going to read
[2091.80 --> 2094.32]  from Acts 2,
[2094.54 --> 2097.46]  verse 1 through 13.
[2097.60 --> 2098.52]  So I'm going to invite you
[2098.52 --> 2099.08]  and encourage you
[2099.08 --> 2100.64]  to open that up
[2100.64 --> 2103.98]  and to head there together.
[2108.86 --> 2115.98]  from Acts 2,
[2116.08 --> 2116.84]  starting at verse 1.
[2120.10 --> 2122.02]  When the day of Pentecost came,
[2122.68 --> 2123.54]  they were all together
[2123.54 --> 2124.42]  in one place.
[2125.50 --> 2125.94]  Suddenly,
[2126.16 --> 2127.08]  a sound like
[2127.08 --> 2127.74]  the blowing
[2127.74 --> 2128.78]  of a violent wind
[2128.78 --> 2129.64]  came from heaven
[2129.64 --> 2130.96]  and filled the whole house
[2130.96 --> 2131.68]  where they were sitting.
[2133.14 --> 2134.02]  They saw
[2134.02 --> 2134.76]  what seemed
[2134.76 --> 2136.14]  to be tongues of fire
[2136.14 --> 2136.90]  that separated
[2136.90 --> 2137.84]  and came to rest
[2137.84 --> 2138.62]  on each of them.
[2139.56 --> 2140.54]  And all of them
[2140.54 --> 2141.00]  were filled
[2141.00 --> 2141.92]  with the Holy Spirit
[2141.92 --> 2142.98]  and began to speak
[2142.98 --> 2143.66]  in other tongues
[2143.66 --> 2144.34]  as the Spirit
[2144.34 --> 2144.96]  enabled them.
[2146.66 --> 2147.14]  Now,
[2148.00 --> 2148.90]  there were staying
[2148.90 --> 2149.60]  in Jerusalem,
[2150.30 --> 2151.50]  God-fearing Jews
[2151.50 --> 2152.34]  from every nation
[2152.34 --> 2152.84]  under heaven.
[2153.76 --> 2154.54]  And when they heard
[2154.54 --> 2155.24]  this sound,
[2155.36 --> 2156.56]  a crowd came together
[2156.56 --> 2157.48]  in bewilderment
[2157.48 --> 2158.60]  because each one
[2158.60 --> 2159.90]  heard their own language
[2159.90 --> 2160.62]  being spoken.
[2162.24 --> 2163.10]  Utterly amazed,
[2163.22 --> 2163.78]  they asked,
[2164.66 --> 2165.62]  Aren't all these
[2165.62 --> 2166.50]  who are speaking
[2166.50 --> 2167.22]  Galileans?
[2167.22 --> 2168.88]  Then,
[2168.96 --> 2169.56]  how is it
[2169.56 --> 2170.38]  that each of us
[2170.38 --> 2170.98]  hears them
[2170.98 --> 2172.68]  in our native language?
[2174.24 --> 2174.80]  Parthians,
[2175.36 --> 2175.84]  Medes,
[2176.24 --> 2176.98]  and Elamites,
[2177.58 --> 2178.44]  residents of
[2178.44 --> 2179.26]  Mesopotamia,
[2179.40 --> 2179.86]  Judea,
[2179.96 --> 2180.74]  and Cappadocia,
[2181.30 --> 2181.76]  Pontus,
[2181.86 --> 2182.28]  and Asia,
[2183.32 --> 2183.68]  Phrygia,
[2183.90 --> 2184.60]  and Pamphylia,
[2184.72 --> 2185.00]  Egypt,
[2185.16 --> 2186.00]  and the parts of Libya
[2186.00 --> 2186.76]  near Cyrene,
[2187.16 --> 2188.06]  visitors from Rome,
[2188.18 --> 2188.70]  both Jews
[2188.70 --> 2189.44]  and converts
[2189.44 --> 2190.10]  to Judaism,
[2191.10 --> 2191.52]  Cretans,
[2191.52 --> 2192.38]  and Arabs.
[2192.92 --> 2193.58]  We hear them
[2193.58 --> 2194.56]  declaring the wonders
[2194.56 --> 2195.06]  of God
[2195.06 --> 2196.94]  in our own tongues.
[2198.52 --> 2200.34]  Amazed and perplexed,
[2200.50 --> 2201.62]  they asked one another,
[2202.14 --> 2205.10]  What does this mean?
[2207.48 --> 2208.72]  Some, however,
[2209.72 --> 2210.60]  made fun of them
[2210.60 --> 2211.36]  and said,
[2211.96 --> 2212.70]  They have had
[2212.70 --> 2214.16]  too much wine.
[2215.36 --> 2216.24]  This is the word
[2216.24 --> 2216.68]  of the Lord.
[2223.00 --> 2224.00]  I'll never forget,
[2224.96 --> 2226.22]  when I was a kid
[2226.22 --> 2227.30]  in elementary school,
[2227.44 --> 2228.18]  in grade four
[2228.18 --> 2228.82]  or five,
[2229.90 --> 2230.28]  school,
[2230.44 --> 2231.72]  we had a principal.
[2231.92 --> 2232.42]  Her name was
[2232.42 --> 2233.66]  Corrie Bootsma.
[2234.62 --> 2235.82]  And prior to being
[2235.82 --> 2236.48]  a principal
[2236.48 --> 2238.70]  in her earlier life,
[2238.82 --> 2239.92]  she and her husband
[2239.92 --> 2241.12]  were missionaries
[2241.12 --> 2242.60]  in the Philippines.
[2242.60 --> 2244.56]  And one day,
[2244.66 --> 2245.50]  she stood in front
[2245.50 --> 2246.02]  of our school
[2246.02 --> 2246.98]  and told her
[2246.98 --> 2248.64]  sort of calling story
[2248.64 --> 2249.96]  as a missionary.
[2250.98 --> 2252.90]  And she shared with us,
[2253.06 --> 2254.44]  and I remember this
[2254.44 --> 2255.14]  so clearly,
[2255.26 --> 2256.06]  it's one of those memories
[2256.06 --> 2257.12]  that just seems
[2257.12 --> 2257.78]  to get planted
[2257.78 --> 2259.10]  deep into who you are.
[2259.46 --> 2260.18]  She stood in front
[2260.18 --> 2260.72]  of the school
[2260.72 --> 2261.54]  and she told us
[2261.54 --> 2262.70]  that when she
[2262.70 --> 2263.68]  and her husband Ted
[2263.68 --> 2265.12]  were trying to figure out
[2265.12 --> 2266.42]  what God was calling
[2266.42 --> 2267.14]  them to do,
[2267.98 --> 2269.82]  she had learned
[2269.82 --> 2270.92]  about these people
[2270.92 --> 2271.74]  in the Philippines
[2271.74 --> 2273.14]  and her heart
[2273.14 --> 2273.94]  began to wonder,
[2274.14 --> 2275.26]  is God calling me there?
[2275.58 --> 2276.48]  Is God calling us
[2276.48 --> 2278.38]  to serve these people?
[2279.22 --> 2279.92]  And one day,
[2280.04 --> 2280.68]  she says,
[2280.94 --> 2281.82]  she told the story
[2281.82 --> 2283.00]  of reading a book,
[2283.14 --> 2284.48]  sitting in her living room,
[2284.84 --> 2285.62]  just reading a book,
[2285.66 --> 2286.82]  and she turned the page
[2286.82 --> 2288.04]  and all of a sudden,
[2288.30 --> 2289.82]  words jumped out
[2289.82 --> 2290.74]  of the page
[2290.74 --> 2291.38]  that said,
[2291.78 --> 2293.24]  go to the Philippines.
[2295.42 --> 2297.42]  She stopped
[2297.42 --> 2299.88]  and had a moment
[2299.88 --> 2300.34]  where she said
[2300.34 --> 2301.42]  what is going on
[2301.42 --> 2302.54]  and she came back
[2302.54 --> 2303.10]  to herself
[2303.10 --> 2303.62]  in that moment
[2303.62 --> 2304.44]  and she looked
[2304.44 --> 2305.06]  at the words
[2305.06 --> 2305.62]  on the page
[2305.62 --> 2306.32]  and nowhere
[2306.32 --> 2307.64]  on the page,
[2308.18 --> 2308.50]  anywhere,
[2309.24 --> 2310.10]  was the phrase
[2310.10 --> 2311.22]  go to the Philippines
[2311.22 --> 2312.48]  or even the word
[2312.48 --> 2313.04]  Philippines
[2313.04 --> 2313.62]  or go.
[2314.38 --> 2314.92]  I'm sure two
[2314.92 --> 2315.72]  was probably there.
[2318.12 --> 2319.10]  The Spirit
[2319.10 --> 2321.64]  spoke to her
[2321.64 --> 2324.18]  in a visible
[2324.18 --> 2326.46]  and real way
[2326.46 --> 2327.58]  and so she
[2327.58 --> 2328.34]  and her husband,
[2328.52 --> 2328.70]  Ted,
[2328.78 --> 2329.28]  in obedience
[2329.28 --> 2330.54]  to that call,
[2330.74 --> 2331.80]  went and served
[2331.80 --> 2332.52]  for years
[2332.52 --> 2334.12]  in the Philippines.
[2335.44 --> 2335.84]  The Spirit
[2335.84 --> 2337.48]  is alive
[2337.48 --> 2338.42]  and active
[2338.42 --> 2339.42]  and speaking
[2339.42 --> 2341.22]  to the church.
[2343.26 --> 2344.54]  A couple weeks ago,
[2344.66 --> 2345.80]  I was chatting
[2345.80 --> 2346.38]  with someone
[2346.38 --> 2348.00]  and they were sharing
[2348.00 --> 2348.58]  a story
[2348.58 --> 2350.34]  of how God
[2350.34 --> 2352.04]  had miraculously
[2352.04 --> 2353.24]  healed them
[2353.24 --> 2354.16]  of something
[2354.16 --> 2354.84]  that was happening
[2354.84 --> 2355.84]  in their life,
[2355.92 --> 2356.34]  something that
[2356.34 --> 2357.36]  they were in the midst
[2357.36 --> 2358.74]  of seeing doctors
[2358.74 --> 2359.74]  and having
[2359.74 --> 2363.84]  cat scans for
[2363.84 --> 2365.24]  and they went
[2365.24 --> 2366.40]  for a follow-up
[2366.40 --> 2367.22]  cat scan
[2367.22 --> 2368.22]  and the technician
[2368.22 --> 2368.56]  said,
[2368.66 --> 2369.08]  hold on,
[2369.74 --> 2370.56]  something's not right
[2370.56 --> 2372.34]  and then they called
[2372.34 --> 2372.88]  in the doctor
[2372.88 --> 2373.46]  and the doctor
[2373.46 --> 2373.74]  said,
[2373.92 --> 2375.04]  something's not right.
[2375.04 --> 2376.96]  the thing
[2376.96 --> 2377.76]  that they had seen
[2377.76 --> 2379.22]  was gone.
[2381.14 --> 2381.62]  Miraculously
[2381.62 --> 2382.74]  gone.
[2384.24 --> 2385.28]  A few months ago,
[2385.38 --> 2386.66]  I heard a similar story.
[2386.78 --> 2387.72]  Somebody who was
[2387.72 --> 2388.16]  dealing with
[2388.16 --> 2389.30]  some other health
[2389.30 --> 2389.92]  concerns
[2389.92 --> 2390.80]  had been seeing
[2390.80 --> 2391.22]  the doctor
[2391.22 --> 2391.86]  for years
[2391.86 --> 2392.96]  trying to get this
[2392.96 --> 2393.58]  and then they went
[2393.58 --> 2395.04]  to another doctor
[2395.04 --> 2396.18]  to do another test
[2396.18 --> 2397.06]  and the doctor said,
[2397.84 --> 2398.90]  you're healthy.
[2400.04 --> 2400.98]  There's nothing
[2400.98 --> 2402.16]  wrong.
[2402.62 --> 2403.18]  The Spirit
[2403.18 --> 2404.62]  is alive
[2404.62 --> 2405.92]  and active
[2405.92 --> 2407.24]  and working
[2407.24 --> 2408.60]  in the world.
[2409.04 --> 2410.24]  That is what
[2410.24 --> 2411.32]  Pentecost
[2411.32 --> 2412.54]  is about.
[2413.86 --> 2414.76]  This morning
[2414.76 --> 2416.38]  as we come together
[2416.38 --> 2418.12]  to worship our God,
[2418.22 --> 2419.18]  I will hope
[2419.18 --> 2419.76]  and pray
[2419.76 --> 2421.14]  that in this time
[2421.14 --> 2422.38]  we will see
[2422.38 --> 2423.80]  that the Spirit
[2423.80 --> 2425.60]  is still
[2425.60 --> 2426.76]  working
[2426.76 --> 2430.08]  and that Pentecost
[2430.08 --> 2431.12]  is
[2431.12 --> 2433.38]  an opportunity
[2433.38 --> 2434.42]  and a marvel
[2434.42 --> 2435.10]  for us
[2435.10 --> 2435.82]  as a church
[2435.82 --> 2436.94]  as we see
[2436.94 --> 2438.00]  God at work
[2438.00 --> 2439.34]  through law
[2439.34 --> 2440.62]  and life
[2440.62 --> 2442.14]  and harvest.
[2444.00 --> 2444.30]  Now,
[2444.80 --> 2446.86]  I'm also well aware
[2446.86 --> 2447.36]  of the fact
[2447.36 --> 2449.36]  that for most of us
[2449.36 --> 2450.86]  participating
[2450.86 --> 2451.72]  in worship
[2451.72 --> 2452.32]  this morning,
[2452.44 --> 2452.84]  when we hear
[2452.84 --> 2453.76]  the word Pentecost,
[2453.88 --> 2454.86]  we immediately
[2454.86 --> 2456.92]  think of Pentecost
[2456.92 --> 2458.24]  as a Christian
[2458.24 --> 2459.60]  holiday,
[2459.82 --> 2460.48]  as a Christian
[2460.48 --> 2461.74]  liturgical act
[2461.74 --> 2463.04]  and service
[2463.04 --> 2464.90]  because that's
[2464.90 --> 2466.16]  our experience.
[2467.34 --> 2467.80]  And yet,
[2468.26 --> 2468.82]  did you notice
[2468.82 --> 2469.80]  what Luke
[2469.80 --> 2470.94]  said?
[2472.18 --> 2472.90]  Luke writes,
[2473.36 --> 2474.02]  when the day
[2474.02 --> 2475.06]  of Pentecost
[2475.06 --> 2476.04]  came,
[2476.98 --> 2477.88]  or down in verse 5,
[2477.96 --> 2478.68]  now they were staying
[2478.68 --> 2479.54]  in Jerusalem,
[2479.70 --> 2480.52]  God-fearing Jews
[2480.52 --> 2481.34]  from every nation
[2481.34 --> 2482.42]  under heaven.
[2484.52 --> 2485.20]  Pentecost
[2485.20 --> 2486.66]  was already happening
[2486.66 --> 2487.96]  when they were
[2487.96 --> 2488.62]  in Jerusalem
[2488.62 --> 2489.38]  because you see,
[2489.50 --> 2490.04]  Pentecost
[2490.04 --> 2491.94]  is a Jewish
[2491.94 --> 2492.66]  festival.
[2493.76 --> 2494.34]  Pentecost
[2494.34 --> 2495.36]  is the Greek
[2495.36 --> 2496.02]  translation
[2496.02 --> 2496.76]  of the word
[2496.76 --> 2497.34]  50,
[2497.58 --> 2498.56]  which would refer
[2498.56 --> 2499.54]  in the Jewish
[2499.54 --> 2499.98]  calendar
[2499.98 --> 2501.36]  to the festival
[2501.36 --> 2502.14]  of weeks
[2502.14 --> 2503.34]  or Shavuot.
[2503.96 --> 2504.16]  Right?
[2504.20 --> 2504.74]  It's a festival
[2504.74 --> 2505.70]  of harvest.
[2505.96 --> 2506.48]  It's a festival
[2506.48 --> 2507.34]  that takes place
[2507.34 --> 2508.74]  50 days
[2508.74 --> 2510.12]  after the Passover.
[2510.84 --> 2511.54]  So the Passover,
[2511.88 --> 2512.44]  you may remember,
[2512.60 --> 2513.82]  is the festival
[2513.82 --> 2514.68]  that they celebrate
[2514.68 --> 2515.36]  and it marks
[2515.36 --> 2517.48]  the exodus
[2517.48 --> 2518.62]  out of Egypt
[2518.62 --> 2520.14]  for the Jewish
[2520.14 --> 2521.08]  people.
[2521.48 --> 2522.36]  And as that story
[2522.36 --> 2522.84]  goes,
[2522.94 --> 2523.30]  the people
[2523.30 --> 2525.16]  leave Egypt,
[2525.40 --> 2526.20]  they cross
[2526.20 --> 2526.96]  the Red Sea
[2526.96 --> 2527.64]  where the armies
[2527.64 --> 2528.08]  of Pharaoh
[2528.08 --> 2528.82]  are destroyed,
[2528.94 --> 2529.58]  and then they find
[2529.58 --> 2530.06]  themselves
[2530.06 --> 2530.98]  in the region
[2530.98 --> 2531.64]  of Sinai.
[2531.74 --> 2532.46]  And there,
[2532.76 --> 2533.76]  they receive
[2533.76 --> 2534.44]  from God
[2534.44 --> 2535.38]  the Ten Commandments.
[2535.44 --> 2535.96]  They receive
[2535.96 --> 2536.54]  from God
[2536.54 --> 2537.12]  the law.
[2537.54 --> 2537.66]  Right?
[2537.78 --> 2538.70]  Moses went
[2538.70 --> 2539.58]  up the mountain
[2539.58 --> 2542.60]  and received
[2542.60 --> 2543.40]  the law
[2543.40 --> 2544.34]  in an encounter
[2544.34 --> 2544.86]  with God.
[2545.64 --> 2546.34]  The festival
[2546.34 --> 2547.24]  of weeks
[2547.24 --> 2548.72]  coming 50 days
[2548.72 --> 2549.68]  after the Passover
[2549.68 --> 2550.78]  marks both
[2550.78 --> 2551.82]  the receiving
[2551.82 --> 2552.54]  of the law
[2552.54 --> 2555.76]  and the harvest,
[2556.50 --> 2557.36]  the first fruits
[2557.36 --> 2558.50]  of the harvest.
[2558.62 --> 2559.16]  Now the festival
[2559.16 --> 2560.12]  of weeks
[2560.12 --> 2560.94]  is also
[2560.94 --> 2562.60]  one of the
[2562.60 --> 2564.90]  pilgrimage festivals.
[2565.18 --> 2565.78]  There's three
[2565.78 --> 2567.02]  pilgrimage festivals
[2567.02 --> 2568.10]  in Jewish
[2568.10 --> 2569.40]  practice.
[2569.58 --> 2571.54]  that has
[2571.54 --> 2571.92]  in it
[2571.92 --> 2572.14]  there,
[2572.40 --> 2573.10]  in Deuteronomy,
[2573.30 --> 2573.78]  they're instructed
[2573.78 --> 2575.08]  and again,
[2576.24 --> 2578.26]  they're instructed
[2578.26 --> 2578.66]  in Exodus
[2578.66 --> 2579.36]  and in Deuteronomy
[2579.36 --> 2580.02]  to travel
[2580.02 --> 2581.24]  to Jerusalem
[2581.24 --> 2582.68]  for these festivals
[2582.68 --> 2584.02]  so that all men
[2584.02 --> 2584.78]  in particular
[2584.78 --> 2585.62]  of age
[2585.62 --> 2586.26]  might come
[2586.26 --> 2587.14]  and worship
[2587.14 --> 2587.52]  God
[2587.52 --> 2588.48]  at the temple.
[2589.08 --> 2589.56]  Pentecost
[2589.56 --> 2590.76]  is one of those
[2590.76 --> 2591.60]  festivals
[2591.60 --> 2593.60]  that brings
[2593.60 --> 2594.10]  people
[2594.10 --> 2595.60]  to Jerusalem.
[2595.76 --> 2596.06]  That's why
[2596.06 --> 2596.48]  we have
[2596.48 --> 2598.74]  staying in
[2598.74 --> 2599.12]  Jerusalem
[2599.12 --> 2599.86]  God-fearing
[2599.86 --> 2600.30]  Jews
[2600.30 --> 2600.94]  from every
[2600.94 --> 2601.42]  nation
[2601.42 --> 2603.44]  under heaven.
[2604.38 --> 2604.78]  Now just so
[2604.78 --> 2605.72]  we can see
[2605.72 --> 2606.24]  that and make
[2606.24 --> 2606.56]  it clear,
[2606.64 --> 2607.00]  we have a little
[2607.00 --> 2607.54]  bit of a map
[2607.54 --> 2608.02]  that I want
[2608.02 --> 2608.64]  to show you
[2608.64 --> 2609.72]  just so you
[2609.72 --> 2610.12]  can see
[2610.12 --> 2611.30]  the regions
[2611.30 --> 2612.92]  from around
[2612.92 --> 2613.42]  the world
[2613.42 --> 2614.78]  that bring,
[2615.28 --> 2615.78]  that come
[2615.78 --> 2616.86]  together here.
[2617.72 --> 2618.24]  And so
[2618.24 --> 2619.24]  you have
[2619.24 --> 2620.70]  Parthians
[2620.70 --> 2621.72]  and Medians
[2621.72 --> 2622.58]  and Elamites,
[2622.78 --> 2623.20]  you have
[2623.20 --> 2624.48]  people from
[2624.48 --> 2625.30]  Mesopotamia
[2625.30 --> 2625.82]  and Judea
[2625.82 --> 2626.58]  and Cappadocia,
[2626.76 --> 2627.20]  Pontius
[2627.20 --> 2627.72]  and Asia,
[2628.28 --> 2628.82]  from Phrygia
[2628.82 --> 2629.62]  and Pamphylia,
[2629.76 --> 2630.18]  Egypt,
[2630.60 --> 2631.34]  and parts
[2631.34 --> 2631.76]  of Libya
[2631.76 --> 2632.40]  and Cyrene,
[2632.50 --> 2632.80]  so North
[2632.80 --> 2633.30]  Africa,
[2633.60 --> 2634.06]  and you
[2634.06 --> 2634.50]  have visitors
[2634.50 --> 2635.22]  from as far
[2635.22 --> 2635.86]  away as
[2635.86 --> 2636.56]  Rome and
[2636.56 --> 2637.16]  Cretans
[2637.16 --> 2637.94]  and Arabs,
[2638.38 --> 2638.66]  right?
[2639.12 --> 2639.94]  The whole
[2639.94 --> 2640.42]  world,
[2641.02 --> 2641.44]  or at least
[2641.44 --> 2641.78]  the whole
[2641.78 --> 2642.30]  empire,
[2642.46 --> 2642.80]  because there
[2642.80 --> 2643.46]  is other
[2643.46 --> 2643.88]  parts of the
[2643.88 --> 2644.18]  world that
[2644.18 --> 2644.48]  are known
[2644.48 --> 2644.82]  at this
[2644.82 --> 2645.06]  time,
[2645.34 --> 2645.66]  the whole
[2645.66 --> 2645.96]  Roman
[2645.96 --> 2646.44]  empire,
[2646.84 --> 2647.44]  Jews from
[2647.44 --> 2647.90]  around there,
[2647.96 --> 2648.22]  the whole
[2648.22 --> 2648.88]  diaspora,
[2649.06 --> 2649.28]  place,
[2649.72 --> 2650.68]  have come
[2650.68 --> 2652.34]  to Jerusalem.
[2654.10 --> 2654.62]  So the
[2654.62 --> 2655.16]  festival of
[2655.16 --> 2655.80]  Pentecost
[2655.80 --> 2657.50]  is about
[2657.50 --> 2658.24]  law and
[2658.24 --> 2659.24]  life lived
[2659.24 --> 2660.28]  in response
[2660.28 --> 2660.82]  to the
[2660.82 --> 2661.10]  law.
[2661.52 --> 2661.88]  The festival
[2661.88 --> 2662.58]  of Pentecost
[2662.58 --> 2663.16]  is about
[2663.16 --> 2664.48]  harvest
[2664.48 --> 2666.20]  and it's
[2666.20 --> 2666.78]  about people
[2666.78 --> 2668.60]  coming to
[2668.60 --> 2669.04]  Jerusalem.
[2670.64 --> 2671.56]  And for
[2671.56 --> 2672.40]  us as
[2672.40 --> 2673.44]  Christians to
[2673.44 --> 2674.62]  better understand
[2674.62 --> 2675.96]  the role of
[2675.96 --> 2676.92]  Pentecost in
[2676.92 --> 2677.92]  our life and
[2677.92 --> 2678.18]  faith,
[2678.32 --> 2678.92]  it's really
[2678.92 --> 2679.46]  important for
[2679.46 --> 2680.50]  us to hang
[2680.50 --> 2681.80]  on to the
[2681.80 --> 2682.78]  Jewish roots
[2682.78 --> 2684.32]  of this
[2684.32 --> 2685.68]  festival.
[2686.98 --> 2687.98]  And it's in
[2687.98 --> 2689.08]  looking at the
[2689.08 --> 2689.98]  roots of this
[2689.98 --> 2691.26]  festival that we
[2691.26 --> 2692.98]  will see how
[2692.98 --> 2694.00]  we can understand
[2694.00 --> 2695.28]  more accurately
[2695.28 --> 2696.68]  Pentecost.
[2697.34 --> 2698.20]  Because I
[2698.20 --> 2698.52]  think,
[2698.78 --> 2699.64]  I'm probably
[2699.64 --> 2700.40]  not mistaken
[2700.40 --> 2700.92]  in this,
[2701.00 --> 2701.84]  but for many
[2701.84 --> 2702.62]  of us,
[2704.28 --> 2704.98]  Pentecost
[2704.98 --> 2705.64]  and the
[2705.64 --> 2706.38]  gift of
[2706.38 --> 2706.94]  the Spirit
[2706.94 --> 2707.96]  and the
[2707.96 --> 2708.48]  gifts of
[2708.48 --> 2708.94]  the Spirit
[2708.94 --> 2710.94]  often just
[2710.94 --> 2712.18]  comes back
[2712.18 --> 2712.74]  to this
[2712.74 --> 2713.46]  idea of
[2713.46 --> 2714.34]  the charismatic
[2714.34 --> 2714.94]  gifts.
[2715.06 --> 2715.32]  They're called
[2715.32 --> 2715.94]  the charismatic
[2715.94 --> 2716.38]  gifts,
[2716.46 --> 2716.74]  the gifts
[2716.74 --> 2717.38]  of tongues,
[2717.94 --> 2718.46]  the gifts
[2718.46 --> 2719.12]  of prophecy,
[2719.64 --> 2720.02]  maybe the
[2720.02 --> 2720.46]  gifts of
[2720.46 --> 2720.76]  healing.
[2720.90 --> 2721.20]  And so when
[2721.20 --> 2721.76]  we think of
[2721.76 --> 2722.52]  Pentecost and
[2722.52 --> 2722.96]  the role of
[2722.96 --> 2723.20]  Spirit,
[2723.26 --> 2723.64]  we think of
[2723.64 --> 2724.72]  these big
[2724.72 --> 2725.44]  picture,
[2725.78 --> 2726.70]  amazing,
[2727.02 --> 2727.46]  charismatic
[2727.46 --> 2728.58]  gifts.
[2728.58 --> 2729.58]  Pentecost
[2729.58 --> 2729.86]  and while
[2729.86 --> 2730.38]  those things
[2730.38 --> 2731.28]  are good
[2731.28 --> 2732.10]  and true
[2732.10 --> 2732.50]  and I'm
[2732.50 --> 2733.20]  not a
[2733.20 --> 2733.48]  strict
[2733.48 --> 2734.26]  cessationist
[2734.26 --> 2734.90]  in that I
[2734.90 --> 2735.70]  believe that
[2735.70 --> 2736.00]  the Spirit
[2736.00 --> 2736.72]  continues to
[2736.72 --> 2737.14]  do that
[2737.14 --> 2737.48]  and to
[2737.48 --> 2738.90]  provide for
[2738.90 --> 2739.50]  opportunities
[2739.50 --> 2740.14]  like that
[2740.14 --> 2740.58]  for the
[2740.58 --> 2741.02]  glory of
[2741.02 --> 2741.46]  God so
[2741.46 --> 2741.76]  that the
[2741.76 --> 2741.96]  church
[2741.96 --> 2742.30]  might be
[2742.30 --> 2742.58]  edified,
[2742.72 --> 2742.94]  so that
[2742.94 --> 2743.36]  the witness
[2743.36 --> 2743.80]  of Jesus
[2743.80 --> 2744.18]  Christ
[2744.18 --> 2744.82]  might be
[2744.82 --> 2745.48]  confirmed,
[2746.10 --> 2746.46]  but
[2746.46 --> 2747.42]  Pentecost
[2747.42 --> 2748.66]  is in
[2748.66 --> 2749.24]  the first
[2749.24 --> 2749.90]  place
[2749.90 --> 2752.02]  about
[2752.02 --> 2752.36]  something
[2752.36 --> 2752.70]  else.
[2755.08 --> 2755.70]  Now Pentecost
[2755.70 --> 2756.24]  in the
[2756.24 --> 2757.70]  Jewish
[2757.70 --> 2758.52]  tradition
[2758.52 --> 2759.06]  as we
[2759.06 --> 2760.22]  have seen
[2760.22 --> 2761.02]  is connected
[2761.02 --> 2761.48]  to the
[2761.48 --> 2762.40]  giving of
[2762.40 --> 2762.80]  the law.
[2763.88 --> 2764.30]  And the
[2764.30 --> 2765.20]  law is
[2765.20 --> 2766.00]  given
[2766.00 --> 2767.60]  originally
[2767.60 --> 2768.56]  so that
[2768.56 --> 2769.16]  the people
[2769.16 --> 2769.66]  of Israel
[2769.66 --> 2770.46]  might know
[2770.46 --> 2771.04]  how to
[2771.04 --> 2771.78]  live in
[2771.78 --> 2772.42]  response
[2772.42 --> 2773.40]  to a
[2773.40 --> 2773.68]  gracious
[2773.68 --> 2774.08]  God
[2774.08 --> 2774.34]  who's
[2774.34 --> 2774.64]  called
[2774.64 --> 2774.90]  them
[2774.90 --> 2775.52]  and chosen
[2775.52 --> 2775.84]  them
[2775.84 --> 2776.74]  and drawn
[2776.74 --> 2777.24]  them to
[2777.24 --> 2777.72]  himself.
[2777.88 --> 2778.30]  The law
[2778.30 --> 2779.22]  is given
[2779.22 --> 2779.78]  so that
[2779.78 --> 2780.72]  in
[2780.72 --> 2781.48]  relationship
[2781.48 --> 2782.16]  to God
[2782.16 --> 2782.72]  the people
[2782.72 --> 2783.80]  might have
[2783.80 --> 2784.56]  life.
[2785.70 --> 2786.38]  But
[2786.38 --> 2786.92]  eventually
[2786.92 --> 2788.60]  what happens
[2788.60 --> 2789.66]  is that
[2789.66 --> 2790.80]  the law
[2790.80 --> 2791.64]  becomes
[2791.64 --> 2793.40]  not a
[2793.40 --> 2794.10]  means of
[2794.10 --> 2794.90]  experiencing
[2794.90 --> 2795.78]  life,
[2795.96 --> 2796.22]  but a
[2796.22 --> 2797.44]  means of
[2797.44 --> 2798.48]  fencing
[2798.48 --> 2799.18]  in
[2799.18 --> 2800.10]  people,
[2800.54 --> 2800.92]  a means
[2800.92 --> 2801.70]  of dividing
[2801.70 --> 2803.22]  people one
[2803.22 --> 2803.86]  from the
[2803.86 --> 2804.04]  other,
[2804.14 --> 2804.66]  a means of
[2804.66 --> 2805.94]  exclusion and
[2805.94 --> 2806.60]  pushing people
[2806.60 --> 2806.96]  away.
[2809.24 --> 2810.46]  The law
[2810.46 --> 2811.88]  becomes
[2811.88 --> 2813.14]  an opportunity
[2813.14 --> 2814.64]  to say
[2814.64 --> 2815.52]  not you,
[2815.70 --> 2817.16]  but you.
[2818.04 --> 2818.30]  And in
[2818.30 --> 2818.62]  some sense
[2818.62 --> 2819.34]  we get
[2819.34 --> 2819.70]  that,
[2819.78 --> 2819.94]  right?
[2819.98 --> 2820.18]  Because
[2820.18 --> 2821.52]  we know
[2821.52 --> 2822.44]  that rules
[2822.44 --> 2823.34]  in and of
[2823.34 --> 2823.58]  themselves
[2823.58 --> 2824.08]  are good
[2824.08 --> 2824.58]  things,
[2824.70 --> 2824.80]  right?
[2824.90 --> 2825.16]  Rules
[2825.16 --> 2825.98]  are given
[2825.98 --> 2826.36]  so that
[2826.36 --> 2826.62]  we might
[2826.62 --> 2827.36]  be safe.
[2827.80 --> 2828.00]  Rules
[2828.00 --> 2828.38]  are given
[2828.38 --> 2828.70]  so that
[2828.70 --> 2828.98]  we might
[2828.98 --> 2829.34]  have
[2829.34 --> 2829.84]  opportunity
[2829.84 --> 2831.24]  to flourish
[2831.24 --> 2831.96]  in whatever
[2831.96 --> 2832.64]  place we
[2832.64 --> 2833.44]  find ourselves.
[2833.90 --> 2834.38]  But what
[2834.38 --> 2835.48]  often happens
[2835.48 --> 2836.28]  with rules
[2836.28 --> 2836.76]  is that
[2836.76 --> 2837.46]  they become
[2837.46 --> 2838.18]  elevated
[2838.18 --> 2838.88]  to
[2838.88 --> 2839.90]  the
[2839.90 --> 2841.34]  perpetuation
[2841.34 --> 2842.14]  of only
[2842.14 --> 2842.70]  the rules
[2842.70 --> 2843.20]  themselves.
[2843.20 --> 2843.30]  rules.
[2844.02 --> 2844.46]  The rule
[2844.46 --> 2844.82]  becomes
[2844.82 --> 2845.04]  more
[2845.04 --> 2845.48]  important
[2845.48 --> 2846.08]  than the
[2846.08 --> 2846.64]  life it
[2846.64 --> 2847.28]  is intended
[2847.28 --> 2848.54]  to provide.
[2849.56 --> 2849.96]  Rules
[2849.96 --> 2850.50]  become,
[2850.80 --> 2851.18]  instead of
[2851.18 --> 2852.32]  a fence
[2852.32 --> 2852.94]  to keep
[2852.94 --> 2853.42]  out the
[2853.42 --> 2853.80]  bad,
[2853.90 --> 2854.30]  they become
[2854.30 --> 2855.04]  a wall
[2855.04 --> 2856.04]  to keep
[2856.04 --> 2856.86]  people trapped.
[2856.86 --> 2859.28]  that's not
[2859.28 --> 2859.68]  what God
[2859.68 --> 2860.32]  had intended,
[2861.48 --> 2863.06]  but that's
[2863.06 --> 2863.48]  what we
[2863.48 --> 2864.20]  see
[2864.20 --> 2865.20]  happen.
[2865.90 --> 2866.22]  It is
[2866.22 --> 2867.14]  human nature
[2867.14 --> 2868.50]  to default
[2868.50 --> 2869.12]  to
[2869.12 --> 2870.52]  elevating
[2870.52 --> 2871.16]  rules
[2871.16 --> 2871.90]  into something
[2871.90 --> 2872.68]  more than
[2872.68 --> 2873.62]  they were
[2873.62 --> 2874.32]  intended to
[2874.32 --> 2874.54]  be.
[2874.64 --> 2874.86]  We call
[2874.86 --> 2875.70]  that legalism
[2875.70 --> 2876.90]  in the
[2876.90 --> 2877.46]  Christian
[2877.46 --> 2877.90]  tradition,
[2877.90 --> 2879.08]  and we so
[2879.08 --> 2879.98]  easily define
[2879.98 --> 2880.60]  ourselves
[2880.60 --> 2881.62]  by that
[2881.62 --> 2882.42]  and in
[2882.42 --> 2882.90]  that way.
[2885.50 --> 2886.18]  Pentecost
[2886.18 --> 2887.78]  as an
[2887.78 --> 2888.22]  opportunity
[2888.22 --> 2889.28]  to remember
[2889.28 --> 2890.46]  the law
[2890.46 --> 2890.88]  and the
[2890.88 --> 2891.40]  life that
[2891.40 --> 2892.44]  comes to
[2892.44 --> 2892.66]  it,
[2892.72 --> 2893.48]  now with
[2893.48 --> 2894.26]  the spirit
[2894.26 --> 2894.76]  for the
[2894.76 --> 2895.26]  Christian
[2895.26 --> 2896.16]  becomes
[2896.16 --> 2896.82]  something
[2896.82 --> 2897.80]  different,
[2897.90 --> 2898.68]  yet built
[2898.68 --> 2899.42]  on that
[2899.42 --> 2900.36]  reality.
[2901.40 --> 2901.80]  We have
[2901.80 --> 2902.20]  a passage
[2902.20 --> 2902.76]  from
[2902.76 --> 2904.18]  2 Corinthians,
[2904.34 --> 2904.66]  I believe
[2904.66 --> 2905.04]  you'll see
[2905.04 --> 2906.24]  that on
[2906.24 --> 2906.72]  the screen.
[2907.82 --> 2907.96]  And
[2907.96 --> 2908.74]  there,
[2909.46 --> 2909.78]  in that
[2909.78 --> 2910.18]  passage,
[2910.30 --> 2910.86]  Paul is
[2910.86 --> 2911.68]  writing,
[2911.86 --> 2912.06]  and he
[2912.06 --> 2912.42]  says,
[2912.90 --> 2913.20]  now,
[2913.74 --> 2914.20]  if the
[2914.20 --> 2914.60]  ministry
[2914.60 --> 2915.40]  that brought
[2915.40 --> 2915.88]  death
[2915.88 --> 2915.94]  death,
[2916.52 --> 2917.12]  which was
[2917.12 --> 2918.04]  engraved
[2918.04 --> 2918.52]  in letters
[2918.52 --> 2919.24]  on stone,
[2919.44 --> 2920.06]  came with
[2920.06 --> 2920.70]  glory so
[2920.70 --> 2921.04]  that the
[2921.04 --> 2921.42]  Israelites
[2921.42 --> 2922.22]  could not
[2922.22 --> 2922.86]  look steadily
[2922.86 --> 2923.26]  at the
[2923.26 --> 2923.72]  face of
[2923.72 --> 2923.98]  Moses
[2923.98 --> 2924.56]  because of
[2924.56 --> 2925.02]  its glory,
[2925.48 --> 2926.24]  transitory
[2926.24 --> 2926.72]  though it
[2926.72 --> 2927.00]  was,
[2927.30 --> 2927.84]  will not
[2927.84 --> 2928.48]  the ministry
[2928.48 --> 2928.96]  of the
[2928.96 --> 2929.48]  spirit be
[2929.48 --> 2930.18]  even more
[2930.18 --> 2930.78]  glorious?
[2930.96 --> 2931.46]  If the
[2931.46 --> 2931.84]  ministry
[2931.84 --> 2932.36]  that brought
[2932.36 --> 2933.12]  condemnation
[2933.12 --> 2933.80]  was glorious,
[2934.06 --> 2934.70]  how much
[2934.70 --> 2935.48]  more glorious
[2935.48 --> 2935.92]  is the
[2935.92 --> 2936.34]  ministry
[2936.34 --> 2937.34]  that brings
[2937.34 --> 2938.12]  righteousness?
[2939.56 --> 2940.30]  For what
[2940.30 --> 2941.02]  was glorious
[2941.02 --> 2942.46]  has no
[2942.46 --> 2943.90]  glory now
[2943.90 --> 2944.82]  in comparison
[2944.82 --> 2945.34]  with the
[2945.34 --> 2946.20]  surpassing
[2946.20 --> 2947.00]  glory?
[2948.50 --> 2948.72]  And if
[2948.72 --> 2950.08]  what was
[2950.08 --> 2950.74]  transitory
[2950.74 --> 2951.24]  came with
[2951.24 --> 2951.58]  glory,
[2951.74 --> 2952.28]  how much
[2952.28 --> 2952.68]  greater
[2952.68 --> 2953.60]  is the
[2953.60 --> 2954.28]  glory of
[2954.28 --> 2955.52]  that which
[2955.52 --> 2956.64]  lasts?
[2957.78 --> 2958.26]  See,
[2958.30 --> 2958.78]  what Paul is
[2958.78 --> 2959.38]  doing here
[2959.38 --> 2959.86]  in this
[2959.86 --> 2960.24]  text,
[2960.40 --> 2961.50]  he is
[2961.50 --> 2963.08]  picking up
[2963.08 --> 2963.78]  on this
[2963.78 --> 2964.94]  idea that
[2964.94 --> 2966.14]  the idea
[2966.14 --> 2966.94]  of Pentecost,
[2967.04 --> 2967.14]  right?
[2967.18 --> 2967.66]  That the
[2967.66 --> 2968.40]  law came
[2968.40 --> 2969.00]  with Moses
[2969.00 --> 2969.50]  and was
[2969.50 --> 2969.86]  meant to
[2969.86 --> 2970.30]  define,
[2970.46 --> 2970.70]  but it
[2970.70 --> 2972.26]  was not
[2972.26 --> 2972.70]  enough,
[2972.76 --> 2973.20]  it was
[2973.20 --> 2973.80]  inadequate
[2973.80 --> 2974.68]  because we
[2974.68 --> 2975.12]  had made
[2975.12 --> 2975.66]  it into
[2975.66 --> 2976.48]  something that
[2976.48 --> 2976.96]  it wasn't
[2976.96 --> 2977.70]  ever intended
[2977.70 --> 2978.26]  to be,
[2978.38 --> 2978.66]  and in
[2978.66 --> 2978.88]  fact,
[2978.98 --> 2979.42]  in so
[2979.42 --> 2980.38]  doing,
[2980.78 --> 2981.80]  the law
[2981.80 --> 2983.74]  becomes for
[2983.74 --> 2984.40]  us and in
[2984.40 --> 2984.88]  our practice,
[2985.02 --> 2985.46]  and Paul
[2985.46 --> 2985.98]  picks this
[2985.98 --> 2987.00]  up in the
[2987.00 --> 2987.58]  book of
[2987.58 --> 2987.96]  Romans,
[2988.82 --> 2988.98]  right,
[2989.04 --> 2990.00]  that the
[2990.00 --> 2990.86]  law becomes
[2990.86 --> 2991.42]  the means
[2991.42 --> 2991.90]  by which
[2991.90 --> 2993.22]  we understand
[2993.22 --> 2995.10]  our sin.
[2996.14 --> 2996.92]  Keep that
[2996.92 --> 2997.82]  Romans passage
[2997.82 --> 2998.22]  up there.
[2999.18 --> 2999.56]  The law
[2999.56 --> 3000.36]  becomes for
[3000.36 --> 3001.86]  us the
[3001.86 --> 3002.50]  means of
[3002.50 --> 3003.16]  convicting
[3003.16 --> 3004.56]  us of
[3004.56 --> 3004.88]  sin.
[3007.04 --> 3007.52]  The law
[3007.52 --> 3009.72]  comes to
[3009.72 --> 3010.36]  show us
[3010.36 --> 3010.90]  how we
[3010.90 --> 3012.52]  have fallen
[3012.52 --> 3013.94]  short of
[3013.94 --> 3014.84]  God's design
[3014.84 --> 3015.56]  and intent
[3015.56 --> 3016.48]  purpose,
[3017.42 --> 3018.46]  but what the
[3018.46 --> 3018.96]  law was
[3018.96 --> 3019.98]  powerless to
[3019.98 --> 3020.66]  do, Paul
[3020.66 --> 3021.34]  says in
[3021.34 --> 3022.32]  Romans 8,
[3022.68 --> 3023.32]  to do in
[3023.32 --> 3023.68]  that it was
[3023.68 --> 3024.36]  weakened by
[3024.36 --> 3025.12]  sinful nature,
[3025.32 --> 3026.28]  God did by
[3026.28 --> 3027.02]  sending his
[3027.02 --> 3027.90]  own son in
[3027.90 --> 3028.58]  the likeness of
[3028.58 --> 3029.90]  sinful man to
[3029.90 --> 3030.58]  be a sin
[3030.58 --> 3031.12]  offering,
[3031.12 --> 3032.10]  and so he
[3032.10 --> 3033.20]  condemned sin
[3033.20 --> 3033.88]  in sinful
[3033.88 --> 3034.46]  man in
[3034.46 --> 3034.94]  order that
[3034.94 --> 3035.42]  the righteous
[3035.42 --> 3036.34]  requirements of
[3036.34 --> 3036.74]  the law
[3036.74 --> 3037.56]  might be
[3037.56 --> 3038.76]  fully met
[3038.76 --> 3040.62]  in us.
[3043.40 --> 3044.20]  Life
[3044.20 --> 3045.98]  now is
[3045.98 --> 3047.28]  defined not
[3047.28 --> 3048.82]  by the
[3048.82 --> 3049.58]  law, but
[3049.58 --> 3050.38]  by what
[3050.38 --> 3051.10]  Paul elsewhere
[3051.10 --> 3051.90]  in Romans
[3051.90 --> 3052.64]  calls the
[3052.64 --> 3053.62]  spirit, or
[3053.62 --> 3054.42]  the law of
[3054.42 --> 3055.40]  the spirit.
[3056.58 --> 3057.20]  Right, life,
[3057.34 --> 3058.18]  our identity
[3058.18 --> 3059.34]  as Christians
[3059.34 --> 3060.56]  is no longer
[3060.56 --> 3061.26]  bound up in
[3061.26 --> 3061.94]  this rule or
[3061.94 --> 3062.56]  that rule, but
[3062.56 --> 3063.46]  instead in
[3063.46 --> 3064.02]  freedom.
[3064.28 --> 3064.76]  It is for
[3064.76 --> 3065.82]  freedom that
[3065.82 --> 3066.66]  Christ has set
[3066.66 --> 3067.16]  you free.
[3067.90 --> 3068.48]  And so when we
[3068.48 --> 3069.18]  look at
[3069.18 --> 3070.36]  Pentecost, we
[3070.36 --> 3071.46]  remember here
[3071.46 --> 3072.24]  and now and
[3072.24 --> 3073.46]  see maybe for
[3073.46 --> 3074.06]  the very first
[3074.06 --> 3074.86]  time that it
[3074.86 --> 3075.26]  is our
[3075.26 --> 3077.08]  identities that
[3077.08 --> 3078.74]  are changed.
[3079.74 --> 3080.88]  It is who we
[3080.88 --> 3081.44]  are in
[3081.44 --> 3082.38]  relationship to
[3082.38 --> 3085.62]  Jesus that is
[3085.62 --> 3086.20]  transformed.
[3091.44 --> 3092.42]  Maybe you
[3092.42 --> 3093.88]  haven't heard
[3093.88 --> 3094.44]  it before,
[3094.62 --> 3095.10]  maybe you
[3095.10 --> 3095.94]  need to hear
[3095.94 --> 3097.00]  it right now,
[3097.10 --> 3097.52]  maybe you
[3097.52 --> 3098.00]  need to
[3098.00 --> 3098.82]  remember,
[3100.42 --> 3101.72]  but you
[3101.72 --> 3103.54]  are a
[3103.54 --> 3103.86]  new
[3103.86 --> 3105.08]  creation.
[3106.32 --> 3107.44]  By grace,
[3107.88 --> 3108.60]  through faith,
[3109.06 --> 3109.74]  you have
[3109.74 --> 3111.06]  been transformed.
[3112.06 --> 3112.60]  Your heart
[3112.60 --> 3113.54]  of stone has
[3113.54 --> 3114.70]  been transformed
[3114.70 --> 3115.50]  by the Spirit
[3115.50 --> 3116.26]  to a heart
[3116.26 --> 3116.98]  of flesh,
[3117.30 --> 3118.32]  now finally,
[3118.56 --> 3118.86]  fully,
[3119.10 --> 3119.40]  freely,
[3119.56 --> 3120.48]  alive in
[3120.48 --> 3121.94]  Jesus Christ.
[3122.94 --> 3123.48]  Who you
[3123.48 --> 3124.88]  are is
[3124.88 --> 3126.78]  now changed.
[3128.32 --> 3129.04]  No longer
[3129.04 --> 3129.80]  are we slaves
[3129.80 --> 3130.34]  to sin,
[3130.46 --> 3130.92]  but instead
[3130.92 --> 3131.74]  in John 15,
[3131.82 --> 3132.46]  15, we
[3132.46 --> 3133.54]  are friends
[3133.54 --> 3134.88]  of Jesus.
[3136.58 --> 3137.40]  No longer
[3137.40 --> 3138.60]  are we by
[3138.60 --> 3139.40]  nature objects
[3139.40 --> 3139.92]  of wrath,
[3140.02 --> 3140.60]  instead we
[3140.60 --> 3141.80]  are loved
[3141.80 --> 3143.12]  of God.
[3143.12 --> 3144.38]  in fact,
[3144.52 --> 3145.74]  1 John 3
[3145.74 --> 3147.10]  says that
[3147.10 --> 3148.16]  we are
[3148.16 --> 3149.28]  lavishly
[3149.28 --> 3150.04]  loved
[3150.04 --> 3150.88]  children
[3150.88 --> 3151.92]  of the
[3151.92 --> 3152.26]  Father.
[3153.82 --> 3154.54]  That is
[3154.54 --> 3154.94]  who you
[3154.94 --> 3155.22]  are.
[3155.88 --> 3156.62]  That is
[3156.62 --> 3157.72]  Pentecostal
[3157.72 --> 3158.40]  purpose,
[3158.40 --> 3158.86]  that you
[3158.86 --> 3159.58]  would understand
[3159.58 --> 3160.80]  that identity
[3160.80 --> 3161.64]  in Jesus
[3161.64 --> 3161.96]  Christ,
[3162.04 --> 3162.62]  that by grace
[3162.62 --> 3163.10]  through faith
[3163.10 --> 3163.88]  you are sons
[3163.88 --> 3164.80]  and daughters
[3164.80 --> 3165.48]  of the
[3165.48 --> 3165.84]  Father,
[3166.18 --> 3166.64]  heirs of
[3166.64 --> 3167.24]  God and
[3167.24 --> 3167.92]  co-heirs
[3167.92 --> 3168.94]  with Christ.
[3169.14 --> 3169.56]  If we
[3169.56 --> 3170.42]  take anything
[3170.42 --> 3170.96]  out of
[3170.96 --> 3171.58]  Pentecost,
[3171.58 --> 3172.20]  it doesn't
[3172.20 --> 3172.64]  need to
[3172.64 --> 3173.54]  be tongues,
[3173.70 --> 3173.96]  it doesn't
[3173.96 --> 3174.20]  need to
[3174.20 --> 3175.06]  be prophecies,
[3175.14 --> 3175.34]  it doesn't
[3175.34 --> 3175.54]  need to
[3175.54 --> 3176.10]  be gifts
[3176.10 --> 3176.54]  of healing,
[3176.72 --> 3177.32]  it must
[3177.32 --> 3177.90]  be that
[3177.90 --> 3178.92]  you are
[3178.92 --> 3179.62]  children
[3179.62 --> 3180.72]  of God
[3180.72 --> 3181.70]  by grace
[3181.70 --> 3182.66]  through faith.
[3183.78 --> 3184.60]  That's all
[3184.60 --> 3185.20]  that matters.
[3187.22 --> 3188.00]  That's who
[3188.00 --> 3188.48]  you are.
[3189.96 --> 3191.32]  That's who
[3191.32 --> 3191.80]  God has
[3191.80 --> 3192.48]  recreated
[3192.48 --> 3192.92]  you
[3192.92 --> 3194.42]  to be.
[3197.06 --> 3197.74]  That's
[3197.74 --> 3199.30]  Pentecostal
[3199.30 --> 3200.80]  purpose.
[3203.08 --> 3203.80]  And that
[3203.80 --> 3204.24]  purpose
[3204.24 --> 3206.10]  has a
[3206.10 --> 3206.90]  direction
[3206.90 --> 3207.94]  to it.
[3208.44 --> 3209.02]  That new
[3209.02 --> 3210.18]  life identity
[3210.18 --> 3210.92]  has a
[3210.92 --> 3212.10]  power that
[3212.10 --> 3212.86]  is infused
[3212.86 --> 3213.64]  into it
[3213.64 --> 3214.26]  so that
[3214.26 --> 3214.70]  you may
[3214.70 --> 3215.60]  go somewhere,
[3215.78 --> 3216.06]  so that
[3216.06 --> 3216.36]  you may
[3216.36 --> 3217.20]  accomplish
[3217.20 --> 3218.32]  something.
[3219.30 --> 3219.52]  Now,
[3220.08 --> 3220.84]  the beginning
[3220.84 --> 3221.62]  of the story,
[3221.92 --> 3222.14]  right,
[3222.24 --> 3223.20]  we have the
[3223.20 --> 3224.12]  disciples all
[3224.12 --> 3224.86]  together in
[3224.86 --> 3226.00]  one place
[3226.00 --> 3226.94]  in Jerusalem
[3226.94 --> 3227.50]  and they are
[3227.50 --> 3228.60]  here in
[3228.60 --> 3229.02]  Jerusalem,
[3229.14 --> 3229.56]  in this
[3229.56 --> 3230.12]  one place
[3230.12 --> 3230.80]  because of
[3230.80 --> 3231.20]  what Jesus
[3231.20 --> 3231.76]  said to
[3231.76 --> 3232.00]  them.
[3232.14 --> 3232.26]  Do you
[3232.26 --> 3232.62]  remember a
[3232.62 --> 3233.00]  couple weeks
[3233.00 --> 3233.48]  ago we
[3233.48 --> 3233.80]  looked at
[3233.80 --> 3234.32]  the Ascension
[3234.32 --> 3234.96]  story from
[3234.96 --> 3235.48]  Acts chapter
[3235.48 --> 3235.80]  1?
[3236.94 --> 3237.56]  Jesus told
[3237.56 --> 3239.10]  them to
[3239.10 --> 3240.94]  go to
[3240.94 --> 3241.82]  Jerusalem
[3241.82 --> 3243.98]  and to
[3243.98 --> 3244.38]  wait
[3244.38 --> 3245.94]  because you
[3245.94 --> 3246.48]  will receive
[3246.48 --> 3247.50]  power when
[3247.50 --> 3247.96]  the Holy
[3247.96 --> 3248.78]  Spirit comes
[3248.78 --> 3249.72]  on you and
[3249.72 --> 3250.34]  you will be
[3250.34 --> 3251.04]  my witnesses
[3251.04 --> 3251.86]  in Jerusalem
[3251.86 --> 3252.84]  and in all
[3252.84 --> 3253.56]  Judea and
[3253.56 --> 3254.30]  Samaria and
[3254.30 --> 3255.04]  to the ends
[3255.04 --> 3256.08]  of the earth.
[3256.08 --> 3258.20]  Jesus has
[3258.20 --> 3258.98]  said to
[3258.98 --> 3259.24]  them when
[3259.24 --> 3259.56]  the Holy
[3259.56 --> 3260.16]  Spirit comes
[3260.16 --> 3260.66]  you will
[3260.66 --> 3261.20]  be my
[3261.20 --> 3261.98]  witnesses
[3261.98 --> 3262.40]  and that
[3262.40 --> 3262.80]  word
[3262.80 --> 3263.58]  witnesses
[3263.58 --> 3264.46]  is a
[3264.46 --> 3265.06]  beautiful
[3265.06 --> 3265.86]  word.
[3266.00 --> 3266.30]  It's actually
[3266.30 --> 3266.84]  the word
[3266.84 --> 3267.30]  in Greek
[3267.30 --> 3267.60]  that we
[3267.60 --> 3268.32]  get the
[3268.32 --> 3268.52]  word
[3268.52 --> 3268.96]  martyr
[3268.96 --> 3269.58]  from
[3269.58 --> 3271.08]  and so
[3271.08 --> 3271.78]  sometimes
[3271.78 --> 3272.18]  when we
[3272.18 --> 3272.60]  hear the
[3272.60 --> 3272.76]  word
[3272.76 --> 3273.08]  witnesses
[3273.08 --> 3273.40]  and we
[3273.40 --> 3273.68]  think of
[3273.68 --> 3273.94]  martyr
[3273.94 --> 3274.38]  we know
[3274.38 --> 3274.70]  that there
[3274.70 --> 3275.08]  are people
[3275.08 --> 3275.88]  who lived
[3275.88 --> 3276.72]  and died
[3276.72 --> 3277.20]  as a
[3277.20 --> 3277.60]  testimony
[3277.60 --> 3278.28]  of faith
[3278.28 --> 3278.96]  but it's
[3278.96 --> 3279.38]  actually
[3279.38 --> 3279.74]  in its
[3279.74 --> 3280.12]  original
[3280.12 --> 3280.78]  usage
[3280.78 --> 3281.46]  a legal
[3281.46 --> 3281.88]  term.
[3281.88 --> 3283.82]  It is a
[3283.82 --> 3284.32]  term of
[3284.32 --> 3285.10]  someone who's
[3285.10 --> 3286.06]  standing before
[3286.06 --> 3286.62]  a judge
[3286.62 --> 3287.28]  called as
[3287.28 --> 3287.86]  a witness
[3287.86 --> 3288.92]  to give
[3288.92 --> 3289.56]  testimony
[3289.56 --> 3290.52]  about
[3290.52 --> 3291.10]  someone
[3291.10 --> 3291.42]  or
[3291.42 --> 3291.90]  something.
[3294.40 --> 3295.14]  And as
[3295.14 --> 3295.48]  we think
[3295.48 --> 3295.98]  about our
[3295.98 --> 3296.78]  Pentecostal
[3296.78 --> 3297.62]  purpose
[3297.62 --> 3298.62]  as we
[3298.62 --> 3299.02]  think about
[3299.02 --> 3299.28]  what it
[3299.28 --> 3299.72]  means to
[3299.72 --> 3300.46]  be a
[3300.46 --> 3300.92]  witness
[3300.92 --> 3304.42]  with as
[3304.42 --> 3304.74]  much
[3304.74 --> 3306.32]  pastoral
[3306.32 --> 3306.96]  sensitivity
[3306.96 --> 3308.10]  perhaps that
[3308.10 --> 3308.58]  I can
[3308.58 --> 3309.60]  muster in
[3309.60 --> 3310.18]  this moment
[3310.18 --> 3311.52]  let me
[3311.52 --> 3312.00]  say that
[3312.00 --> 3312.78]  sometimes
[3312.78 --> 3314.82]  we
[3314.82 --> 3317.70]  misunderstand
[3317.70 --> 3318.98]  or we
[3318.98 --> 3319.78]  sell ourselves
[3319.78 --> 3320.18]  short
[3320.18 --> 3321.28]  on the
[3321.28 --> 3321.90]  purpose of
[3321.90 --> 3322.12]  what it
[3322.12 --> 3322.54]  means to
[3322.54 --> 3323.40]  be a
[3323.40 --> 3323.78]  witness.
[3324.82 --> 3325.42]  Sometimes
[3325.42 --> 3326.34]  we've
[3326.34 --> 3326.70]  heard that
[3326.70 --> 3327.44]  line from
[3327.44 --> 3328.48]  St. Francis
[3328.48 --> 3329.12]  of Assisi
[3329.12 --> 3329.80]  that says
[3329.80 --> 3330.56]  always preach
[3330.56 --> 3331.08]  the gospel
[3331.08 --> 3331.54]  and if
[3331.54 --> 3332.12]  necessary
[3332.12 --> 3333.16]  use words.
[3334.04 --> 3334.36]  And then we
[3334.36 --> 3335.12]  practice things
[3335.12 --> 3336.34]  like relational
[3336.34 --> 3337.32]  evangelism or
[3337.32 --> 3338.58]  lifestyle evangelism
[3338.58 --> 3339.06]  and don't get me
[3339.06 --> 3339.56]  wrong those are
[3339.56 --> 3340.00]  good
[3340.00 --> 3341.16]  good things.
[3341.30 --> 3341.62]  We need to
[3341.62 --> 3342.52]  live our
[3342.52 --> 3343.16]  lives in such
[3343.16 --> 3343.50]  a way that
[3343.50 --> 3344.10]  they are a
[3344.10 --> 3345.22]  testimony of
[3345.22 --> 3345.68]  who Jesus
[3345.68 --> 3346.42]  Christ is.
[3346.80 --> 3347.30]  But if you
[3347.30 --> 3347.68]  are a
[3347.68 --> 3348.18]  witness
[3348.18 --> 3349.24]  standing in
[3349.24 --> 3349.52]  front of
[3349.52 --> 3350.10]  a judge
[3350.10 --> 3350.88]  called to
[3350.88 --> 3351.34]  speak on
[3351.34 --> 3351.78]  someone's
[3351.78 --> 3352.28]  behalf
[3352.28 --> 3353.52]  you don't
[3353.52 --> 3354.14]  say well
[3354.14 --> 3354.84]  follow me
[3354.84 --> 3355.46]  judge and
[3355.46 --> 3355.96]  let me show
[3355.96 --> 3356.30]  you the
[3356.30 --> 3356.74]  truth of
[3356.74 --> 3357.08]  what this
[3357.08 --> 3357.54]  person is
[3357.54 --> 3357.78]  saying.
[3358.54 --> 3359.50]  You speak
[3359.50 --> 3360.26]  words.
[3361.28 --> 3362.20]  You tell
[3362.20 --> 3362.96]  words.
[3363.10 --> 3363.78]  You tell
[3363.78 --> 3364.38]  the story.
[3364.56 --> 3365.22]  You preach
[3365.22 --> 3365.78]  the gospel
[3365.78 --> 3366.82]  like Paul's
[3366.82 --> 3367.50]  charge to
[3367.50 --> 3368.26]  Timothy to
[3368.26 --> 3369.14]  preach the
[3369.14 --> 3369.66]  gospel to
[3369.66 --> 3370.28]  always be
[3370.28 --> 3370.96]  prepared in
[3370.96 --> 3371.70]  season and
[3371.70 --> 3372.26]  out of season
[3372.26 --> 3372.88]  to correct
[3372.88 --> 3373.52]  and to
[3373.52 --> 3374.08]  rebuke.
[3375.08 --> 3375.90]  Our calling
[3375.90 --> 3376.40]  as Christians
[3376.40 --> 3377.10]  is to live
[3377.10 --> 3377.60]  such good
[3377.60 --> 3378.06]  lives among
[3378.06 --> 3378.46]  the pagans
[3378.46 --> 3378.76]  that though
[3378.76 --> 3379.22]  they accuse
[3379.22 --> 3379.64]  us of doing
[3379.64 --> 3380.34]  wrong they
[3380.34 --> 3380.76]  will see
[3380.76 --> 3381.36]  God on the
[3381.36 --> 3381.68]  day he
[3381.68 --> 3382.16]  visits and
[3382.16 --> 3382.98]  glorify him.
[3383.28 --> 3384.06]  Yes and
[3384.06 --> 3384.52]  amen.
[3384.52 --> 3384.62]  men.
[3388.12 --> 3389.22]  But unless the
[3389.22 --> 3389.58]  word is
[3389.58 --> 3391.58]  preached how
[3391.58 --> 3391.88]  will they
[3391.88 --> 3392.26]  believe?
[3394.02 --> 3394.86]  Unless the
[3394.86 --> 3395.74]  message is
[3395.74 --> 3397.90]  proclaimed how
[3397.90 --> 3398.76]  will they know
[3398.76 --> 3399.72]  who we are
[3399.72 --> 3400.26]  witnessing
[3400.26 --> 3401.48]  about?
[3402.90 --> 3404.38]  The deep
[3404.38 --> 3405.78]  reality here is
[3405.78 --> 3406.54]  that people are
[3406.54 --> 3407.46]  not saved by
[3407.46 --> 3408.28]  your example.
[3410.14 --> 3410.94]  People are
[3410.94 --> 3412.00]  saved by the
[3412.00 --> 3413.34]  gospel preached
[3413.34 --> 3414.60]  and believed.
[3415.60 --> 3416.94]  That is our
[3416.94 --> 3418.38]  Pentecostal
[3418.38 --> 3419.32]  purpose to
[3419.32 --> 3420.76]  go out into
[3420.76 --> 3421.88]  all the world
[3421.88 --> 3422.84]  and preach the
[3422.84 --> 3423.40]  good news.
[3423.58 --> 3424.98]  The harvest is
[3424.98 --> 3426.06]  plentiful Jesus
[3426.06 --> 3426.92]  said but the
[3426.92 --> 3427.50]  workers are
[3427.50 --> 3427.78]  few.
[3428.16 --> 3429.72]  It is amazing
[3429.72 --> 3431.62]  that in this
[3431.62 --> 3432.16]  feast of
[3432.16 --> 3433.00]  Pentecost
[3433.00 --> 3434.52]  a feast of
[3434.52 --> 3435.16]  harvest
[3435.16 --> 3437.60]  we talk about
[3437.60 --> 3438.56]  having to
[3438.56 --> 3439.86]  preach the
[3439.86 --> 3440.26]  gospel.
[3440.96 --> 3441.46]  There's this
[3441.46 --> 3442.02]  beautiful quote
[3442.02 --> 3442.40]  from John
[3442.40 --> 3444.80]  Piper that
[3444.80 --> 3445.76]  says it is a
[3445.76 --> 3446.56]  shame that the
[3446.56 --> 3447.76]  term Pentecostal
[3447.76 --> 3448.84]  power has for
[3448.84 --> 3449.86]  many people become
[3449.86 --> 3451.02]  more associated
[3451.02 --> 3451.78]  with speaking in
[3451.78 --> 3452.54]  tongues than with
[3452.54 --> 3453.26]  the harvest of
[3453.26 --> 3454.40]  world evangelism.
[3455.06 --> 3456.24]  The main point is
[3456.24 --> 3457.46]  it is a feast of
[3457.46 --> 3458.28]  harvest in
[3458.28 --> 3459.10]  Jerusalem and on
[3459.10 --> 3460.30]  this very day
[3460.30 --> 3461.70]  Jesus pours out
[3461.70 --> 3462.44]  his spirit in
[3462.44 --> 3463.50]  extraordinary power
[3463.50 --> 3465.30]  and 3,000 people
[3465.30 --> 3466.68]  are harvested from
[3466.68 --> 3467.32]  the kingdom of
[3467.32 --> 3468.88]  darkness into the
[3468.88 --> 3469.72]  kingdom of God.
[3469.72 --> 3472.58]  of course what
[3472.58 --> 3474.46]  Piper is referring
[3474.46 --> 3475.26]  to is that
[3475.26 --> 3476.38]  following this
[3476.38 --> 3477.32]  encounter with the
[3477.32 --> 3478.26]  Holy Spirit Peter
[3478.26 --> 3479.34]  stands up and he
[3479.34 --> 3480.66]  preaches to the
[3480.66 --> 3482.58]  crowds of those
[3482.58 --> 3484.52]  God-fearing people
[3484.52 --> 3485.30]  and Jews from
[3485.30 --> 3485.90]  around the world.
[3486.04 --> 3486.74]  He preaches to
[3486.74 --> 3487.42]  them and at the
[3487.42 --> 3488.22]  end of his
[3488.22 --> 3490.94]  message we read
[3490.94 --> 3492.44]  that 3,000 were
[3492.44 --> 3493.30]  added to their
[3493.30 --> 3494.58]  number that day.
[3496.00 --> 3497.66]  Peter got up and
[3497.66 --> 3499.22]  he preached the
[3499.22 --> 3499.66]  gospel.
[3500.24 --> 3500.90]  That's what
[3500.90 --> 3503.10]  Pentecost is about.
[3504.14 --> 3505.08]  It's not about
[3505.08 --> 3506.16]  tongues, it's not
[3506.16 --> 3507.50]  about prophecy, it's
[3507.50 --> 3508.54]  not about gifts of
[3508.54 --> 3509.50]  healing, it is about
[3509.50 --> 3511.44]  harvest for the
[3511.44 --> 3512.28]  kingdom of God.
[3513.16 --> 3513.64]  It is about
[3513.64 --> 3515.20]  proclaiming a bold
[3515.20 --> 3516.66]  gospel of a risen
[3516.66 --> 3518.00]  Savior who has
[3518.00 --> 3520.02]  conquered sin and
[3520.02 --> 3520.94]  death and is now
[3520.94 --> 3522.62]  Lord over all
[3522.62 --> 3524.24]  creation, exalted to
[3524.24 --> 3525.44]  the right hand of God
[3525.44 --> 3526.06]  the Father from
[3526.06 --> 3526.66]  where he will come
[3526.66 --> 3527.86]  to judge the living
[3527.86 --> 3528.32]  and the dead.
[3528.46 --> 3530.12]  This is our
[3530.12 --> 3531.06]  message.
[3533.50 --> 3534.40]  And look, I get
[3534.40 --> 3534.72]  it.
[3535.86 --> 3536.84]  It can be hard
[3536.84 --> 3538.06]  and it can be
[3538.06 --> 3539.50]  scary and we
[3539.50 --> 3540.32]  can be really
[3540.32 --> 3541.18]  worried.
[3541.28 --> 3542.10]  What if I don't
[3542.10 --> 3543.02]  know the answers to
[3543.02 --> 3543.58]  their questions?
[3543.92 --> 3544.66]  What if I don't
[3544.66 --> 3545.58]  have the right words
[3545.58 --> 3546.10]  to say?
[3547.40 --> 3548.34]  What if I'm not
[3548.34 --> 3549.34]  good enough?
[3549.34 --> 3553.66]  Can I just say
[3553.66 --> 3555.94]  that's always been
[3555.94 --> 3556.22]  true?
[3557.12 --> 3558.08]  That's always been
[3558.08 --> 3558.50]  the right.
[3558.54 --> 3559.54]  Even Peter, okay?
[3559.70 --> 3560.44]  If you have your
[3560.44 --> 3561.24]  Bible in front of
[3561.24 --> 3562.46]  you, look at
[3562.46 --> 3563.12]  Acts 2.
[3564.10 --> 3565.10]  Acts 2, the end
[3565.10 --> 3566.20]  of Peter's sermon
[3566.20 --> 3567.72]  in chapter, in
[3567.72 --> 3568.64]  verse 39, he
[3568.64 --> 3571.18]  says, repent and
[3571.18 --> 3571.90]  be baptized every
[3571.90 --> 3572.46]  one of you in the
[3572.46 --> 3572.90]  name of Jesus
[3572.90 --> 3573.54]  Christ for the
[3573.54 --> 3574.16]  forgiveness of your
[3574.16 --> 3574.86]  sins and you will
[3574.86 --> 3575.70]  receive the gift of
[3575.70 --> 3576.30]  the Holy Spirit.
[3576.38 --> 3577.52]  He says, the promise
[3577.52 --> 3579.14]  is for you and your
[3579.14 --> 3580.26]  children and for
[3580.26 --> 3581.46]  all who are far
[3581.46 --> 3582.84]  off, for all whom
[3582.84 --> 3584.04]  the Lord our God
[3584.04 --> 3584.90]  will call.
[3586.72 --> 3587.36]  Now if you know
[3587.36 --> 3589.28]  Peter's story, you
[3589.28 --> 3590.42]  know that what he
[3590.42 --> 3591.14]  at that moment
[3591.14 --> 3592.44]  thought was all
[3592.44 --> 3593.10]  whom the Lord our
[3593.10 --> 3594.48]  God would call were
[3594.48 --> 3595.38]  his fellow Jews or
[3595.38 --> 3596.12]  God-fearing Jewish
[3596.12 --> 3596.44]  people.
[3597.54 --> 3598.60]  You know that Peter
[3598.60 --> 3599.42]  didn't know the
[3599.42 --> 3600.04]  whole story.
[3600.30 --> 3600.98]  He didn't know
[3600.98 --> 3601.38]  enough.
[3601.48 --> 3601.94]  He didn't know
[3601.94 --> 3603.02]  everything because
[3603.02 --> 3603.62]  in just a few
[3603.62 --> 3604.38]  chapters he's going
[3604.38 --> 3604.96]  to get a vision
[3604.96 --> 3606.22]  from God that says
[3606.22 --> 3607.42]  that Gentiles, that
[3607.42 --> 3608.74]  is non-believing
[3608.74 --> 3610.32]  non-Jewish people
[3610.32 --> 3611.20]  are going to be
[3611.20 --> 3612.34]  included in this
[3612.34 --> 3613.42]  gospel message.
[3613.52 --> 3613.82]  They're going to be
[3613.82 --> 3614.78]  included in this
[3614.78 --> 3615.98]  proclamation call.
[3616.08 --> 3616.44]  They're going to be
[3616.44 --> 3618.24]  included as heirs of
[3618.24 --> 3619.74]  Abraham just like
[3619.74 --> 3620.66]  the Jewish people
[3620.66 --> 3620.94]  were.
[3622.34 --> 3623.16]  And he's going to
[3623.16 --> 3623.88]  go and he's going
[3623.88 --> 3624.84]  to have an encounter
[3624.84 --> 3626.44]  that confirms that.
[3626.80 --> 3628.20]  And yet, just a few
[3628.20 --> 3629.36]  chapters later, he's
[3629.36 --> 3630.12]  going to be rebuked
[3630.12 --> 3631.16]  by Paul for still
[3631.16 --> 3632.34]  practicing his
[3632.34 --> 3634.30]  Jewish-centric way
[3634.30 --> 3634.88]  in the world.
[3635.52 --> 3636.56]  He doesn't get it.
[3636.56 --> 3637.84]  And yet, here, he
[3637.84 --> 3639.58]  preaches and 3,000
[3639.58 --> 3640.70]  people are added to
[3640.70 --> 3641.36]  their number that
[3641.36 --> 3641.60]  day.
[3642.80 --> 3643.86]  It's always been true
[3643.86 --> 3644.50]  that we don't know
[3644.50 --> 3644.96]  everything.
[3645.72 --> 3646.54]  It's always been true
[3646.54 --> 3647.28]  that we don't have
[3647.28 --> 3648.20]  all the answers.
[3648.52 --> 3649.56]  And it's always been
[3649.56 --> 3650.88]  true that people
[3650.88 --> 3651.76]  might look at you
[3651.76 --> 3652.92]  and think you are
[3652.92 --> 3653.64]  crazy.
[3654.64 --> 3655.62]  It's always been true
[3655.62 --> 3656.32]  that people might look
[3656.32 --> 3657.14]  at you and think you
[3657.14 --> 3658.26]  are ridiculous.
[3658.52 --> 3659.64]  In 1 Corinthians,
[3659.80 --> 3660.88]  Paul says that God
[3660.88 --> 3661.88]  chose the foolish
[3661.88 --> 3663.32]  things of the world
[3663.32 --> 3664.90]  to shame the wise.
[3665.50 --> 3666.56]  Gospel-believing,
[3666.80 --> 3668.52]  gospel-preaching Christians
[3668.52 --> 3669.60]  are going to look like
[3669.60 --> 3670.90]  fools to those
[3670.90 --> 3673.42]  who don't know God.
[3674.20 --> 3676.64]  In fact, in our text,
[3677.18 --> 3678.42]  some are amazed and
[3678.42 --> 3679.32]  perplexed, and that
[3679.32 --> 3680.72]  will be true as you
[3680.72 --> 3681.74]  go forward and preach
[3681.74 --> 3682.14]  the gospel.
[3682.26 --> 3682.98]  There are some who
[3682.98 --> 3684.30]  will be amazed.
[3684.42 --> 3685.86]  There always are.
[3686.06 --> 3687.12]  And there are some
[3687.12 --> 3688.74]  who will make fun of
[3688.74 --> 3689.94]  them, and they said
[3689.94 --> 3690.92]  they've had too much
[3690.92 --> 3691.26]  wine.
[3691.26 --> 3695.58]  It's always going
[3695.58 --> 3696.32]  to be the case
[3696.32 --> 3697.54]  that some will believe
[3697.54 --> 3698.82]  and some won't.
[3699.50 --> 3700.48]  It's always going
[3700.48 --> 3701.12]  to be the case
[3701.12 --> 3702.26]  that some will ridicule
[3702.26 --> 3704.08]  and some will be amazed.
[3704.58 --> 3705.34]  It's always going
[3705.34 --> 3705.92]  to be the case
[3705.92 --> 3707.04]  that you don't know
[3707.04 --> 3707.86]  enough.
[3709.76 --> 3711.10]  But it's not about you.
[3712.74 --> 3713.72]  It's about the
[3713.72 --> 3715.34]  Pentecostal purpose
[3715.34 --> 3716.06]  of the Spirit
[3716.06 --> 3717.28]  come transforming
[3717.28 --> 3718.24]  hearts and lives,
[3718.28 --> 3719.00]  about you being
[3719.00 --> 3720.32]  the vehicle of God
[3720.32 --> 3721.48]  and the means by which
[3721.48 --> 3722.72]  the gospel is proclaimed
[3722.72 --> 3724.10]  so they can be
[3724.10 --> 3725.18]  changed.
[3727.02 --> 3727.82]  Pentecostal purpose
[3727.82 --> 3729.80]  is life lived
[3729.80 --> 3730.98]  in the Spirit
[3730.98 --> 3732.60]  for a harvest
[3732.60 --> 3733.88]  of nations.
[3734.86 --> 3735.80]  And Pentecostal
[3735.80 --> 3736.52]  Christians
[3736.52 --> 3738.18]  must go.
[3739.64 --> 3740.46]  In the Jewish
[3740.46 --> 3741.52]  roots of this festival,
[3741.86 --> 3742.68]  people from around
[3742.68 --> 3743.20]  the world
[3743.20 --> 3744.58]  came to Jerusalem.
[3745.10 --> 3745.82]  In the Christian
[3745.82 --> 3746.32]  application
[3746.32 --> 3747.64]  of this new
[3747.64 --> 3748.32]  reality,
[3748.32 --> 3749.22]  Christians
[3749.22 --> 3750.18]  must go
[3750.18 --> 3751.38]  to the world.
[3753.00 --> 3754.08]  And it may be
[3754.08 --> 3754.82]  that God
[3754.82 --> 3755.58]  is calling you
[3755.58 --> 3756.12]  to be
[3756.12 --> 3757.30]  a global
[3757.30 --> 3758.08]  missionary.
[3758.30 --> 3758.84]  It may be
[3758.84 --> 3759.26]  that God
[3759.26 --> 3759.90]  is calling you
[3759.90 --> 3760.58]  to be a
[3760.58 --> 3761.52]  vocational
[3761.52 --> 3762.32]  full-time
[3762.32 --> 3762.66]  missionary
[3762.66 --> 3763.14]  somewhere
[3763.14 --> 3764.46]  around the world.
[3764.54 --> 3765.06]  And if God
[3765.06 --> 3765.90]  is calling you
[3765.90 --> 3766.20]  in that,
[3766.24 --> 3766.60]  if you are
[3766.60 --> 3767.24]  wondering that,
[3767.28 --> 3767.58]  if you are
[3767.58 --> 3768.86]  hearing that voice
[3768.86 --> 3769.48]  and not sure
[3769.48 --> 3769.94]  what to do,
[3770.14 --> 3771.12]  would you call me?
[3771.22 --> 3772.12]  Would you reach out
[3772.12 --> 3772.74]  to me and I can
[3772.74 --> 3773.34]  connect you with
[3773.34 --> 3774.04]  different resources
[3774.04 --> 3774.60]  and agencies
[3774.60 --> 3775.16]  and prayers
[3775.16 --> 3775.78]  and discernment
[3775.78 --> 3776.22]  and the like
[3776.22 --> 3776.60]  and we can
[3776.60 --> 3777.48]  figure that out
[3777.48 --> 3777.78]  together,
[3777.88 --> 3778.18]  that we can
[3778.18 --> 3779.12]  celebrate that
[3779.12 --> 3779.78]  as a church,
[3779.88 --> 3780.18]  that God
[3780.18 --> 3780.78]  is calling you
[3780.78 --> 3781.12]  in that?
[3783.52 --> 3784.44]  But even if God
[3784.44 --> 3785.40]  isn't calling you
[3785.40 --> 3786.54]  to global
[3786.54 --> 3787.38]  missions,
[3788.06 --> 3790.34]  God is telling you
[3790.34 --> 3791.44]  that you are
[3791.44 --> 3792.02]  a missionary.
[3793.78 --> 3794.82]  Every single
[3794.82 --> 3796.00]  Christian is,
[3796.28 --> 3797.48]  by definition,
[3798.92 --> 3799.42]  missionary.
[3800.72 --> 3801.22]  The Father
[3801.22 --> 3801.90]  has sent me,
[3801.98 --> 3802.46]  says Jesus,
[3802.62 --> 3803.64]  so I am
[3803.64 --> 3804.70]  sending you.
[3804.70 --> 3806.38]  you are
[3806.38 --> 3807.70]  a witness.
[3809.80 --> 3810.22]  And so tell
[3810.22 --> 3810.80]  the story.
[3811.78 --> 3812.72]  Tell the story
[3812.72 --> 3813.18]  of God
[3813.18 --> 3813.60]  at work
[3813.60 --> 3814.12]  in the world
[3814.12 --> 3815.12]  in Jesus Christ.
[3815.28 --> 3815.90]  Tell the story
[3815.90 --> 3816.36]  of Jesus
[3816.36 --> 3817.48]  as the true
[3817.48 --> 3817.92]  and better,
[3818.00 --> 3819.26]  the only fulfillment
[3819.26 --> 3820.16]  of all our
[3820.16 --> 3821.12]  heart's longings
[3821.12 --> 3821.92]  and desire.
[3822.08 --> 3822.98]  Tell the story
[3822.98 --> 3823.92]  in the power
[3823.92 --> 3825.12]  of the Spirit
[3825.12 --> 3825.92]  and see
[3825.92 --> 3827.20]  Pentecostal purpose
[3827.20 --> 3828.12]  come alive
[3828.12 --> 3829.18]  in you.
[3829.98 --> 3830.76]  Tell the story
[3830.76 --> 3831.28]  of how God
[3831.28 --> 3832.48]  transformed your life
[3832.48 --> 3833.68]  and is transforming
[3833.68 --> 3834.88]  your life
[3834.88 --> 3836.28]  so that we
[3836.28 --> 3837.12]  might live
[3837.12 --> 3838.66]  in the law
[3838.66 --> 3839.74]  of the Spirit.
[3840.50 --> 3841.16]  So that we
[3841.16 --> 3841.90]  might live
[3841.90 --> 3842.96]  in the Spirit
[3842.96 --> 3843.50]  of love.
[3843.72 --> 3844.16]  So that we
[3844.16 --> 3845.10]  might produce
[3845.10 --> 3846.02]  fruit.
[3847.96 --> 3848.82]  So that we

[4302.48 --> 4305.46]  He is the Lord.
[4306.68 --> 4311.80]  Who is like unto Him, never ending in days.

[4430.84 --> 4455.66]  Our God is the Lord.
[4455.66 --> 4460.86]  When the storm is a little bit stronger
[4460.86 --> 4467.26]  When the fear in my heart digs a little bit deeper
[4467.26 --> 4473.90]  When my faith to stand gets a little bit weaker
[4473.90 --> 4480.54]  Where could I run to? Where could I go?
[4480.54 --> 4483.82]  Even when it feels like my world is shaking
[4483.82 --> 4486.62]  Even when I've had all that I can take
[4486.62 --> 4490.70]  I know you'll never let me go
[4490.70 --> 4496.34]  And even when the waters won't stop rising
[4496.34 --> 4499.38]  Even when I'm caught in the dead of the night
[4499.38 --> 4503.78]  I know no matter how it ends
[4503.78 --> 4506.42]  You're with me even there
[4506.42 --> 4515.66]  When the days up ahead look a little bit brighter
[4515.66 --> 4522.02]  But the grip of the past holds a little bit tighter
[4522.02 --> 4528.42]  I'm reminded your grace never asked for perfection
[4528.42 --> 4534.74]  I'm restored cause I'm yours and I stand forgiving
[4534.74 --> 4541.14]  Even when it feels like my world is shaking
[4541.14 --> 4544.22]  Even when I've had all that I can take
[4544.22 --> 4548.30]  I know you'll never let me go
[4548.30 --> 4553.90]  And even when the waters won't stop rising
[4553.90 --> 4556.98]  Even when I'm caught in the dead of the night
[4556.98 --> 4561.34]  I know no matter how it ends
[4561.34 --> 4564.10]  You're with me even there
[4564.10 --> 4566.70]  And even in the middle of the struggle
[4566.70 --> 4569.90]  And even when it's hard to remember
[4569.90 --> 4573.26]  You alone am out of faith when
[4573.26 --> 4575.54]  I'm standing on your promises
[4575.54 --> 4579.54]  And I know that even in the thick of a battle
[4579.54 --> 4582.86]  And even through the valley of the shadows
[4582.86 --> 4586.14]  You alone am out of faith when
[4586.14 --> 4588.34]  I'm standing on your promises
[4588.34 --> 4591.18]  So where could I run to?
[4592.30 --> 4593.82]  Where could I go?
[4595.42 --> 4599.02]  Even when it feels like my world is shaking
[4599.02 --> 4601.74]  Even when I've had all that I can take
[4601.74 --> 4605.86]  I know you'll never let me go
[4605.86 --> 4611.30]  And even when the waters won't stop rising
[4611.30 --> 4614.58]  Even when I'm caught in the dead of the night
[4614.58 --> 4619.26]  Even when I'm caught in the dead of the night
[4619.26 --> 4621.70]  Even when I'm caught in the dead of the night
[4621.70 --> 4623.10]  Even when I'm caught in the dead of the night
[4623.10 --> 4624.98]  You're with me, yeah
[4624.98 --> 4628.58]  No matter how it ends
[4628.58 --> 4634.52]  You're with me even there
[4634.52 --> 4643.46]  There was a time that I swore I would never go back
[4643.46 --> 4646.78]  I was blind to the truth
[4646.78 --> 4649.24]  Didn't know what I had
[4649.24 --> 4651.62]  I was running
[4651.62 --> 4652.98]  I was searching
[4652.98 --> 4656.08]  But every place I turned for healing
[4656.08 --> 4659.50]  Left me more broken than the last
[4659.50 --> 4661.62]  Take me back
[4661.62 --> 4664.26]  To the place that feels like home
[4664.26 --> 4667.12]  To the people I can depend on
[4667.12 --> 4670.30]  To the faith that's in my bones
[4670.30 --> 4672.30]  Take me back
[4672.30 --> 4672.38]  Take me back
[4672.38 --> 4673.62]  To a preacher
[4673.62 --> 4675.08]  In a verse
[4675.08 --> 4677.76]  Where they've seen me at my worst
[4677.76 --> 4680.44]  To the love I had at first
[4680.44 --> 4684.50]  Oh, I wanna go to church
[4684.50 --> 4689.44]  Trying to walk on my own
[4689.44 --> 4691.82]  But I'm wound up lost
[4691.82 --> 4696.42]  Now I'm making my way to the foot of the cross
[4696.42 --> 4701.10]  It's not a trophy for the winners
[4701.10 --> 4704.16]  It's a shelter for the sinners
[4704.16 --> 4706.82]  And it's right where I belong
[4706.82 --> 4709.54]  Take me back
[4709.54 --> 4712.22]  To the place that feels like home
[4712.22 --> 4715.16]  To the people I can depend on
[4715.16 --> 4718.24]  To the faith that's in my bones
[4718.24 --> 4720.10]  Take me back
[4720.10 --> 4721.58]  To a preacher
[4721.58 --> 4723.00]  In a verse
[4723.00 --> 4725.72]  Where they've seen me at my worst
[4725.72 --> 4728.42]  To the love I had at first
[4728.42 --> 4731.06]  Oh, I wanna go to church
[4731.06 --> 4736.06]  I wanna go to church
[4736.06 --> 4737.06]  I wanna go to church
[4737.06 --> 4745.34]  Oh, more than an obligation
[4745.34 --> 4748.22]  It's our foundation
[4748.22 --> 4750.70]  The family of God
[4750.70 --> 4752.94]  I know it's hard
[4752.94 --> 4756.20]  But we need a turner
[4756.20 --> 4758.94]  With sisters and brothers
[4758.94 --> 4763.10]  Oh, take me back
[4763.10 --> 4765.78]  To the place that feels like home
[4765.78 --> 4768.48]  To the people I can depend on
[4768.48 --> 4771.62]  To the faith that's in my bones
[4771.62 --> 4773.52]  Take me back
[4773.52 --> 4774.94]  To a preacher
[4774.94 --> 4776.34]  In a verse
[4776.34 --> 4779.02]  Where they've seen me at my worst
[4779.02 --> 4781.74]  To the love I had at first
[4781.74 --> 4784.20]  Oh, I wanna go to church
[4784.20 --> 4789.84]  I wanna go to church
[4789.84 --> 4794.20]  I wanna go to church
