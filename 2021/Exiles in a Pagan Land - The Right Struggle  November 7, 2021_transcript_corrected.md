[0.00 → 2.60] Sometimes choosing just to sing
[2.60 → 9.00] Is the thing that changes everything
[9.00 → 11.66] Hallelujah
[11.66 → 16.22] When the storm is relentless
[16.22 → 17.22] Hallelujah
[17.22 → 21.88] When the battle is endless
[21.88 → 24.06] In the middle of the in-between
[24.06 → 26.72] In the middle of the questioning
[26.72 → 31.14] Over every worry, every fear
[31.14 → 34.60] Hallelujah, even here
[34.60 → 40.70] Hallelujah, even here
[40.70 → 45.36] Hallelujah, even here
[56.72 → 76.26] I've tried so hard to see it
[76.26 → 81.18] Took me so long to believe it
[81.18 → 85.52] You choose someone like me
[85.52 → 90.02] To carry your victory
[90.02 → 95.76] Perfection could never hurt me
[95.76 → 100.18] You give what we don't deserve
[100.18 → 105.66] And you take the broken things
[105.66 → 109.72] And raise them to glory
[109.72 → 114.60] You are my champion
[114.60 → 121.18] Giants fall when you stand undefeated
[121.18 → 125.14] Every battle you've won
[125.14 → 130.28] I am who you say I am
[130.28 → 134.32] You crown me with confidence
[134.32 → 135.96] I am seated
[135.96 → 140.98] In the heavenly place undefeated
[140.98 → 145.84] With the one who has conquered it all
[145.84 → 152.88] Now I can finally see it
[152.88 → 157.86] You're teaching me how to receive it
[157.86 → 162.26] So let all this driving cease
[162.26 → 166.38] Oh, this is my victory
[166.38 → 170.34] You are my champion
[170.34 → 171.34] You are my champion
[171.34 → 177.96] Oh, giants fall when you stand undefeated
[177.96 → 181.92] Every battle you've won
[181.92 → 186.98] I am who you say I am
[186.98 → 190.48] You crown me with confidence
[190.48 → 192.68] I am seated
[192.68 → 197.72] In the heavenly place undefeated
[197.72 → 202.46] With the one who has conquered it all
[202.46 → 207.48] When I lift my voice in shout
[207.48 → 212.42] Every wall comes crashing down
[212.42 → 215.44] I have the authority
[215.44 → 221.74] Jesus has given me
[221.74 → 227.34] When I open up my mouth
[227.34 → 232.04] Miracles start breaking out
[232.04 → 235.24] I have the authority
[235.24 → 241.34] Jesus has given me
[241.34 → 245.16] You are my champion
[245.16 → 247.12] You are my champion
[247.12 → 251.84] Giants fall when you stand undefeated
[251.84 → 253.04] Undefeated
[253.04 → 255.48] Every battle you've won
[255.48 → 264.54] He was my champion
[264.54 → 265.48] And I always have to keep up front of my mouth
[265.48 → 269.38] In the 한복
[270.42 → 271.42] Set up with your shield
[276.14 → 276.96] I abroad
[276.96 → 278.64] You are my champion
[278.76 → 280.72] I show over
[280.72 → 281.96] I am being recorded
[281.96 → 287.24] Good morning.
[288.60 → 290.14] How's everyone doing this morning?
[292.12 → 293.74] Louder for the people on the live stream.
[293.84 → 294.84] How's everyone doing this morning?
[295.96 → 297.52] Hey, there we go.
[297.62 → 298.08] Thank you.
[298.62 → 303.08] I'm just standing up here wasting time until Adrian finds his way to the front.
[304.20 → 304.98] Here he comes.
[305.98 → 307.00] Everyone, there's Adrian.
[307.14 → 307.80] Welcome, Adrian.
[307.80 → 314.10] I do want to welcome you to worship this morning.
[314.32 → 318.90] If you're visiting with us or if you're checking us out for the first time here or online,
[319.00 → 319.58] my name is Chris.
[319.98 → 325.10] I'm one of the pastors here, and it's my privilege, along with these others and a few others you
[325.10 → 329.70] haven't yet seen, to lead you in worship this morning together.
[329.80 → 333.64] Before we begin, there are just a couple announcements we want to make.
[333.64 → 342.26] First, you have been hearing about the kids' choir that will be used as part of our broader
[342.26 → 348.08] choral Christmas performance that will happen later in this year.
[348.72 → 355.12] The first practice was scheduled for today after service, but because of circumstances
[355.12 → 361.02] outside our control and outside our church, that first practice is being postponed until
[361.02 → 361.56] next week.
[361.78 → 365.26] So next week, Sunday, kids' choir practice after service.
[365.64 → 368.60] Here, if you have any questions, you can talk to Mark about that.
[370.20 → 377.30] Also, just a reminder that we have cadets starting, or cadets is this week, Thursday.
[377.42 → 384.68] And so cadets is a young boys' ministry and program that we run here that happens on Thursday
[384.68 → 385.04] night.
[385.22 → 388.46] And so if you have any questions about that, you can grab Daryl, who's over here.
[388.56 → 389.24] Wave your hand, Daryl.
[389.24 → 389.70] Thank you.
[390.14 → 391.52] He will answer your questions.
[391.70 → 392.74] And Dave, he's over there.
[392.82 → 393.96] He wants to be acknowledged too.
[394.06 → 394.58] Yep, Dave.
[394.64 → 395.06] Very good.
[397.08 → 399.86] They can answer your questions about what that looks like.
[399.86 → 403.28] And then finally, I'm going to put this on your hearts.
[403.50 → 407.34] Next week, in our worship together, we will be celebrating communion.
[407.66 → 409.76] That is the Lord's Supper or the Eucharist.
[409.76 → 414.58] And so we will come to the table of God as a community of God.
[414.58 → 428.50] And so we encourage you to spend this week preparing your hearts, preparing your lives, and talking to your families, if that is your circumstance and situation, so that we can come to the table meaningfully together next week.
[428.50 → 435.60] If you have any questions about what that might look like for you, please grab me after the service, and I'm happy to address that with you.
[436.46 → 441.90] Let's stand together as we are called and welcomed by God into his presence.
[441.90 → 442.90] Let's pray.
[442.90 → 443.90] Let's pray.
[443.90 → 447.88] I invite you to receive the greeting of our good God.
[449.42 → 461.90] Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Saviour, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[462.64 → 463.22] Everyone said?
[464.20 → 464.60] Amen.
[465.54 → 466.56] Let's worship God together.
[466.56 → 466.68] Amen.
[466.68 → 467.02] Amen.
[469.30 → 472.24] Join us this morning as we praise the Lord.
[472.92 → 474.94] Praise God in his sanctuary.
[475.76 → 477.44] Praise him in his mighty heavens.
[478.34 → 480.44] Praise him for his mighty deeds.

[502.96 → 504.42] Praise the Lord
[504.42 → 523.28] I praise the hallelujah
[523.28 → 530.44] In the presence of my enemies
[530.44 → 535.40] I raise the hallelujah
[535.40 → 542.52] Louder than the unbelief
[542.52 → 547.22] I raise the hallelujah
[547.22 → 553.08] My weapon is a melody
[553.08 → 559.24] I raise the hallelujah
[559.24 → 566.24] Heaven comes to fight for me
[566.24 → 573.40] I'm going to sing in the middle of the storm
[573.40 → 576.40] Louder and louder
[576.40 → 579.40] You're going to hear my praises roar
[579.40 → 582.56] Up from the ashes

[615.88 → 623.04] I will watch the darkness bleed
[623.04 → 628.04] I raise the hallelujah
[628.04 → 634.20] In the middle of the mystery
[634.20 → 638.20] I raise the hallelujah

[640.20 → 647.36] Fear you've lost your hold
[647.36 → 653.36] I'm going to sing in the middle of the storm
[653.36 → 654.52] The King is a song
[654.52 → 656.52] I raise the hallelujah
[656.52 → 658.52] I raise the hallelujah
[658.52 → 660.52] I raise the hallelujah
[660.52 → 661.52] I raise the hallelujah
[661.52 → 668.68] Up from the thunder
[668.68 → 670.12] And your 하나 when the quarter is not

[670.72 → 672.18] The King comes to die
[672.18 → 672.68] All hands of God
[672.68 → 673.68] Shaun's Thousand corner

[974.94 → 980.32] Who can question any of His words?
[981.48 → 986.32] Who can teach the one who knows all things?
[986.32 → 994.32] Who can fathom all His wondrous deeds?

[1149.86 → 1156.16] Our God, seated on His throne,
[1156.16 → 1160.82] Come let us adore Him.
[1161.98 → 1165.98] Behold our King,
[1166.28 → 1168.70] Nothing can compare,
[1169.74 → 1175.52] Come let us adore Him.
[1186.16 → 1189.38] O God, we come before you.
[1189.70 → 1193.10] We enter into your sanctuary to bring praises to you.
[1193.90 → 1197.00] Seated on your throne, we come to adore you, our King.
[1198.00 → 1201.22] With us, we bring our pain and suffering and sin,
[1201.72 → 1203.30] Some wearing it on their sleeves,
[1203.72 → 1205.48] Others keeping it hidden and in secret,
[1206.22 → 1207.20] But you see it all.
[1207.88 → 1211.06] God, whether we are approaching you for the first time,
[1211.06 → 1212.24] The tenth time,
[1212.94 → 1213.72] The hundredth,
[1213.72 → 1214.36] Thousandth,
[1214.44 → 1215.36] The millionth time,
[1215.96 → 1218.46] Your grace is a well too great to fathom,
[1218.86 → 1220.80] And your love exceeds the heaven's reach
[1220.80 → 1223.78] To where we, so lowly and broken, come to you.
[1224.50 → 1225.10] You say,
[1225.92 → 1227.78] Call upon me in your day of trouble,
[1228.10 → 1229.18] I will deliver you,
[1229.60 → 1231.12] And you shall glorify me.
[1231.82 → 1232.36] You say,
[1232.62 → 1235.82] I will cleanse you from all our guilt of our sin against me,
[1235.82 → 1239.88] And will forgive all the guilt of your sin and rebellion against me.
[1240.64 → 1244.86] You humbled yourself from a place of glory and died for our sins.
[1245.36 → 1247.86] You called us to yourself in our times of trouble.
[1248.78 → 1251.76] May we turn to the world around us and bring glory to you,
[1252.10 → 1254.30] The gracious Saviour of our ruined lives.
[1254.72 → 1257.80] For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.
[1258.80 → 1259.96] In your name we pray.
[1260.32 → 1260.64] Amen.
[1265.82 → 1279.08] Jesus, was той taken one of course to us and did not see you,
[1279.08 → 1279.88] Oh God, I will gift you,
[1279.88 → 1281.36] Oh Lord, I will deliver you to our sins again,
[1281.36 → 1283.98] Oh Lord, as we will deliver you to your Saviour.
[1283.98 → 1304.14] O Lord, my rock and my redeemer, the greatest treasure of my longing soul.
[1304.14 → 1317.82] My God, like you there is no other, true delight is found in you alone.
[1318.44 → 1333.10] Your grace, a wealth too deep to fathom, your love exceeds the heavens reach.
[1333.10 → 1347.10] Your truth, a fount of perfect wisdom, my highest good and my unending need.
[1347.10 → 1365.24] O Lord, my rock and my redeemer, strong defender of my weary heart.
[1365.24 → 1379.68] My sword to fight the cruel deceiver, and my shield against its hateful doors.
[1379.68 → 1386.58] My song, when enemies surround me.
[1387.48 → 1394.24] My hope, when tides of sorrow rise.
[1394.54 → 1399.82] My joy, when trials are ap pounding.
[1399.82 → 1408.68] Your faithfulness, my refuge in the night.
[1408.68 → 1426.68] O Lord, my rock and my redeemer, gracious Saviour of my ruined life.
[1426.68 → 1434.04] My guilt and cross laid on your shoulders.
[1434.04 → 1441.76] In my place, you suffered, bled, and died.
[1441.76 → 1447.44] You rose, the grave and death are conquered.
[1449.44 → 1456.32] You broke my bonds of sin and shame.
[1456.32 → 1462.06] You rose, the grave and death are conquered.
[1463.94 → 1469.76] You broke my bonds of sin and shame.
[1469.76 → 1471.68] You broke my bonds.
[1471.68 → 1473.26] You broke my bonds.
[1473.26 → 1477.32] You broke my bonds.
[1477.32 → 1479.62] You broke my bonds.
[1479.62 → 1480.16] You broke my bonds.
[1480.16 → 1481.50] You broke my bonds.
[1481.50 → 1482.22] You broke my bonds with me.
[1482.22 → 1483.04] You broke my bonds.
[1483.04 → 1486.78] You broke my bonds.
[1486.78 → 1488.20] You broke your bonds.
[1488.28 → 1488.58] You broke my bonds.

[1606.22 → 1613.14] 68 CRC churches at present are working on sponsoring refugees in our denomination.
[1613.96 → 1620.12] So, and hopefully at some point we will also be re-sponsoring or sponsoring again someone
[1620.12 → 1623.06] coming from one of these countries.
[1624.20 → 1628.04] So today we ask you to please give generously as the Lord has given you.

[1725.78 → 1727.78] Thank you.
[1727.78 → 1729.78] Thank you.
[1729.78 → 1733.82] Every hour I need Thee.
[1733.82 → 1744.82] O bless me now, my Saviour, I come to Thee.
[1746.54 → 1755.78] I need Thee every hour in joy or pain.
[1755.78 → 1764.62] Come quickly and abide, for life is brought.
[1765.02 → 1769.78] I need Thee, O I need Thee.

[1774.04 → 1783.78] O bless me now, my Saviour, I come to Thee.
[1785.78 → 1795.08] O bless me now, my Saviour, I come to Thee.
[1795.08 → 1799.22] O bless me now, my Saviour, I come to Thee.
[1799.22 → 1807.72] all right I'm here this morning we had to give you a report on council your council has been
[1807.72 → 1811.94] busy we had a meeting this past week and I thought it'd be a good idea just to give you
[1811.94 → 1816.52] some highlights of what we've been up to or what we're doing in those meetings
[1816.52 → 1825.66] thing of great pride is that we had an opportunity to approve the volunteer list for all the
[1825.66 → 1830.04] different things that are happening at our church both ministries and programs and stuff so it was
[1830.04 → 1835.60] really awesome to go through that list as council to see how many of you are supporting and contributing
[1835.60 → 1839.10] to the ministries and programs here so we were able to go through all that that was great
[1839.10 → 1846.50] pastor Chris reported on some of the governance items we're working on and reviewing at the church
[1846.50 → 1853.80] Tracy is working with him on that as part of the doing some surveys and trying to gather information
[1853.80 → 1858.46] on uh what how things have been going and where we should be going in the future to make
[1858.46 → 1866.62] things more optimal uh we had a bunch of uh delegates from this or a bunch of council members from this
[1866.62 → 1871.34] church that went to the classes meetings last couple weeks ago so we got a report on that so
[1871.34 → 1876.08] that was good to hear about what's going on in our classes and in the denomination in general
[1876.08 → 1884.90] and we another uh cool thing that's going on is we had a report from Brandon muller it's interesting
[1884.90 → 1890.24] getting Mexico missions for the youth going again so he's going to start putting a little bit of work
[1890.24 → 1894.38] into that and seeing where that takes us with Ovid we're not sure what's all going to happen but we
[1894.38 → 1901.58] kind of encouraged him to start working on that and see where that heads, and we reviewed the budget
[1901.58 → 1908.30] and uh had a good conversation about that so we're ready to uh to pass that on to you for the
[1908.30 → 1914.10] congregational meeting that is coming up on December 6th so that's what we've been up to so we were busy
[1914.10 → 1918.36] this week so that was it was good to get together with all the new council members and to have some
[1918.36 → 1924.74] time to talk about the life of the church on that note I want to this is the kind of the time of the
[1924.74 → 1931.08] year we start talking about we're getting to the end of our year and to talk about uh the budget and uh we
[1931.08 → 1936.54] have a shortfall happening right now so uh we want to encourage everyone to spend some time this week
[1936.54 → 1942.12] thinking about how they can uh give to this church we've got some good vibe going some good momentum
[1942.12 → 1947.86] going so we want everybody to kind of spend some time at home with your families to seeing how you can
[1947.86 → 1952.44] give generously to this church to keep these programs and ministries and the lights on in this
[1952.44 → 1959.18] building so we would like to encourage you to do that and I'm doing double shift here today so the next thing

[2042.48 → 2046.58] executed even though some people try to get in the way of the plan but at the end of the day god
[2046.58 → 2050.02] made his plan come true so we're going to hear about that today is that going to be exciting

[2151.68 → 2155.36] all who love you lord and may every creature praise your name
[2155.36 → 2165.32] lord god psalm 145 rings true always and yet as we praise your name here this morning there are things
[2165.32 → 2172.30] in this world we do not understand we think of places in the world where there are war places where
[2172.30 → 2178.30] dictators reign where governments are corrupt where guerrilla warfare rages on
[2178.30 → 2186.34] places where famine and drought are normal where kids can't eat and mothers can't drink places where
[2186.34 → 2194.62] education is hard to come by and disease is easy to come by places where suffering is allowed persecution
[2194.62 → 2203.36] is encouraged and death is feared god our father we pray for the people whom that is a reality for today
[2203.36 → 2209.54] in the midst of their suffering may your spirit be working in the midst of that suffering may your church
[2209.54 → 2216.58] be reaching in the midst of that suffering make us aware of how we can be instruments of your change
[2216.58 → 2218.14] your love your peace
[2218.14 → 2225.74] close to home lord in Canada and here in Langley we pray for our leaders pray for the decisions that they
[2225.74 → 2233.20] make lord god unite our nation not under a political platform but with a love and respect for people and
[2233.20 → 2239.06] their views may accountability be practiced and when disagreements occur may your spirit lead
[2239.06 → 2240.34] healthy discussions
[2240.34 → 2248.18] in this church god we are grateful for all you have blessed us with thank you for children and for

[2275.70 → 2283.38] and in that joy god move us to be more Christlike with our time with our service to the community
[2284.42 → 2288.18] with our love for each other with our finances
[2288.18 → 2295.14] be with those who are dealing with health concerns like Willie bob Benita and Janet and many more in
[2295.14 → 2300.58] our congregation pray for those who are still dealing with the ramifications of this pandemic
[2300.58 → 2306.50] for those who are sick who've lost loved ones who find themselves in relational tensions due to
[2306.50 → 2314.26] differences in opinion may you reign through all of this lord god pray for those in our community who are
[2314.26 → 2320.90] shut in who are anxious who are depressed or who are just having a hard go of life right now
[2322.42 → 2328.50] lord may they know that you are there with them always and may we as your body their brothers and
[2328.50 → 2338.42] sisters be present for them all too and lord be with us now as we open your word be with pastor Chris as
[2338.42 → 2344.90] he brings your word to us and may we hear your voice tugging at our hearts today give us the wisdom
[2344.90 → 2353.46] and the courage not only to hear your word today but to act on it as well in Jesus name who lived and died
[2353.46 → 2367.46] and rose again for us all we pray amen
[2383.46 → 2402.50] Christ has been listening to him, and we hold sports this week
[2408.02 → 2411.54] we hope we look back
[2411.54 → 2416.22] All right, use this time to sign the Bible to open it in 1 Peter 4.
[2427.18 → 2428.48] About now, hey.
[2434.96 → 2439.40] As I said, in just a minute, we are going to read from 1 Peter 4.
[2439.40 → 2443.64] We're going to start at verse 12, and we'll carry through to the end of that chapter.
[2444.92 → 2450.52] As you are getting that ready, I'm going to lead us into the text this morning.
[2451.02 → 2453.22] I had a chance this week.
[2453.30 → 2457.74] I was talking to someone who's taking some university classes right now,
[2457.80 → 2460.00] and they had a final last week.
[2460.04 → 2462.02] And so I started thinking about tests.
[2462.88 → 2466.28] How many of you take tests in your life on a regular basis?
[2467.14 → 2469.62] Here's like university or school-aged kids.
[2471.02 → 2476.82] When I was in high school, I hated tests.
[2477.50 → 2481.60] Now, I wasn't a very good student, mind you, so that might be part of the reason.
[2482.16 → 2484.22] And I was also a bit of a...
[2485.22 → 2488.60] I don't know what the polite company word for it is.
[2489.00 → 2490.94] I wasn't the kind of student you wanted to have.
[2490.94 → 2495.38] And so on day, I remember getting a test, sitting down in the class.
[2495.46 → 2498.14] The teacher walked around and put the test on all of our desks.
[2498.30 → 2502.12] And I spent about four minutes flipping through the pages, looking at it and going,
[2502.38 → 2503.58] I don't know any of this stuff.
[2503.62 → 2504.62] So I wrote my name on it.
[2504.70 → 2506.02] I walked up to the front of the class.
[2506.10 → 2507.20] I put it on the teacher's desk.
[2507.52 → 2509.42] And I said, I don't know any of this.
[2509.64 → 2511.64] And she said, well, can't you just guess?
[2512.32 → 2514.70] And I said, can't you be a better teacher?
[2514.70 → 2520.58] Yeah, I was that kind of kid.
[2524.10 → 2527.64] Elementary and high school-age kids, that's not the takeaway from today's message.
[2529.30 → 2530.00] Sorry, Kobe.
[2533.28 → 2536.42] Now, fast-forward a few years, and I go to university.
[2537.92 → 2542.76] And I would be the first to tell you that I loved tests.
[2542.76 → 2545.84] In fact, I loved exam season.
[2546.18 → 2551.72] When exam season came around as a university student, I got excited because it was an awesome
[2551.72 → 2556.32] opportunity to think back on everything that I had learned and to really engage in that
[2556.32 → 2563.16] semester-long process of taking in all of this information and having a chance to write
[2563.16 → 2564.70] out our answers.
[2564.88 → 2566.46] I remember I wrote one exam.
[2567.10 → 2568.66] We had a three-hour time slot.
[2568.66 → 2575.78] I took three and a half hours, and I wrote, I think it was 22 pages front and back of full
[2575.78 → 2576.42] scat paper.
[2576.54 → 2580.22] So that's the long exam paper, front and back, 22 sheets.
[2580.40 → 2582.26] So that's 44 pages.
[2582.92 → 2585.34] Just wrote and wrote and wrote furiously.
[2585.60 → 2587.14] And I loved every minute of it.
[2588.30 → 2589.50] Now, what was the difference?
[2591.14 → 2592.84] I actually liked what I was doing.
[2592.84 → 2598.32] Now, sure, I was a little bit more mature and responsible, but I understood the purpose
[2598.32 → 2600.76] of the test.
[2602.60 → 2606.04] And so I was able to experience joy in taking it.
[2607.48 → 2608.62] Your Bibles are open.
[2609.68 → 2612.64] 1 Peter 4, starting in verse 12.
[2612.64 → 2622.88] Dear friends, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come upon you to test you
[2622.88 → 2626.40] as though something strange were happening to you.
[2627.52 → 2636.32] But rejoice in as much as you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be
[2636.32 → 2639.42] overjoyed when his glory is revealed.
[2639.42 → 2645.36] If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed.
[2646.14 → 2649.40] For the spirit of glory and of God rests on you.
[2650.70 → 2658.06] If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer or a thief or any kind of criminal or even as a meddler.
[2659.32 → 2667.40] However, if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God that you bear that name.
[2667.40 → 2672.20] For it is time for judgment to begin with God's household.
[2673.02 → 2678.60] And if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God?
[2679.68 → 2687.94] And if it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?
[2687.94 → 2699.66] So then, those who suffer according to God's will should commit themselves to their faithful creator and continue to do good.
[2700.30 → 2701.52] This is the word of the Lord.
[2701.52 → 2711.00] Now, Peter jumps right in this text, and so we're going to do the same.
[2711.08 → 2713.34] He jumps right in, and he says,
[2713.46 → 2717.46] Dear friends, or if you remember last week, we looked a little bit more closely at that word,
[2717.56 → 2719.34] and it means beloved, right?
[2719.36 → 2721.52] Or beloved is the old pronunciation.
[2721.86 → 2723.72] That is God's chosen.
[2724.02 → 2725.64] You are loved of God.
[2725.64 → 2734.66] And so those loved of God, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that's come upon you to test you.
[2735.90 → 2739.90] Now, we're going to spend a moment in that word test, but just quickly,
[2740.24 → 2748.54] that word surprise, they do not be surprised, is the same word that Peter used back in verse 4 of this chapter.
[2748.54 → 2750.98] Now, we didn't read that, but Peter says there,
[2751.42 → 2757.32] They, that is the pagan world around, the people who are not part of the church family of God,
[2757.52 → 2766.16] they are surprised that you do not join them in their reckless wild living, and they heap abuse on you.
[2767.00 → 2776.06] So for Peter, by using that word in two places, it is a contrast of expectations, right?
[2776.06 → 2780.00] They are surprised, and we shouldn't be surprised.
[2780.96 → 2786.00] They are surprised by what we as Christians do, and the way we as Christians live together,
[2786.50 → 2792.68] and we as Christians aren't surprised by their reactions to that,
[2792.76 → 2800.50] and by the trials, the suffering, or the testing that comes as a result of being Christian.
[2800.50 → 2811.76] And instead of surprise, then, Peter wants us to reframe, or to rightly frame,
[2812.02 → 2816.92] what those trials are, what those fiery ordeals might be.
[2817.76 → 2821.86] He says that they come to test you.
[2823.20 → 2826.70] Now, what is a test for?
[2826.70 → 2834.08] The word that's used here by Peter in Greek, in the original language that this is written in,
[2834.14 → 2838.60] is used in a few other places as well, and so we can use those to help us understand.
[2839.46 → 2842.78] In Matthew 6, Jesus teaches us to pray by saying,
[2843.00 → 2844.48] Lead us not into temptation.
[2845.36 → 2847.98] That word, temptation, is the same one that Peter uses.
[2848.62 → 2850.84] So we could say, lead us not into testing.
[2850.84 → 2857.62] Or in Luke 8, in the parable of the sower, you remember that story that Jesus tells,
[2859.20 → 2865.84] the seed that gets cast out in among the weeds, Jesus explains, he says,
[2865.96 → 2868.64] In the time of testing, they fall away.
[2869.84 → 2874.26] Or again, in 1 Corinthians 10, Paul there writes,
[2874.26 → 2879.58] No trial has come to you except that which is common to all.
[2880.20 → 2882.12] The word trial is the same one.
[2883.02 → 2885.86] We looked recently in this church in the book of James.
[2886.00 → 2887.26] James 1.21 says,
[2887.38 → 2893.58] Consider it pure joy, brothers and sisters, when you face many trials of many kinds.
[2895.64 → 2899.58] So what is the purpose of a test or of a trial?
[2899.58 → 2900.08] Right?
[2901.18 → 2902.20] And here's the thing.
[2902.28 → 2908.88] When you are in school, you have a test in order to prove to the teacher or to the professor
[2908.88 → 2910.56] that this is what you've learned.
[2912.04 → 2913.80] Is that what Peter means?
[2915.68 → 2916.18] Right?
[2916.26 → 2921.80] And in this case then, if a test is to prove what we have learned to the teacher,
[2922.04 → 2924.92] in that case, would the teacher here be God?
[2926.22 → 2926.68] Right?
[2926.68 → 2933.82] Are tests in life and trials and temptations, are they to prove to God that we've got it all figured out?
[2933.88 → 2935.06] That we've got it right?
[2935.14 → 2938.26] That, you know, in the core of our being we've really changed?
[2938.82 → 2939.06] Right?
[2939.08 → 2942.66] That we've checked all the doctrine boxes of knowing what to do.
[2942.74 → 2946.88] We can answer all the Heidelberg Catechism or New City Catechism questions.
[2947.24 → 2947.44] Right?
[2947.50 → 2949.20] And that we've now made it?
[2950.32 → 2951.70] Is that what a test is like?
[2951.70 → 2958.18] And if that's what a test is like, are we able to, at some point in that journey, say to the teacher,
[2958.84 → 2959.84] you should have taught me better?
[2962.32 → 2967.64] Or is a test in Peter's construction, it's not going to surprise you, I think it's this latter one,
[2967.64 → 2973.48] is it more like a weightlifter going for a personal best?
[2974.48 → 2974.60] Right?
[2974.66 → 2975.10] A PB.
[2976.10 → 2976.30] Right?
[2976.34 → 2987.14] And that if you lift a max weight until failure, or you increase your bench press weight until you can only do one clean, proper form, drop and press.
[2987.38 → 2987.54] Right?
[2987.58 → 2989.44] That's your fail point.
[2989.54 → 2991.28] That's your new personal best.
[2991.28 → 2996.42] And in that case, right, that's a test of your personal ability.
[2996.54 → 2998.22] In that case, who is the test for?
[2999.56 → 3000.92] The test is for you.
[3002.02 → 3009.88] As you learn what your personal best is, as you learn what your limit is, I think that is what Peter has in mind.
[3010.46 → 3010.64] Right?
[3010.66 → 3015.90] That the test, the trial, the struggle isn't to prove your faith to God.
[3015.90 → 3022.26] It's to prove your faith genuine or to make your faith stronger to you.
[3023.84 → 3029.76] And that's why, ultimately, you can rejoice, if we follow the logic of Peter, when the trial comes,
[3030.02 → 3034.42] because it means that you are participating in the sufferings of Christ.
[3034.54 → 3034.60] Right?
[3034.84 → 3035.76] Here's what I mean.
[3035.76 → 3042.86] When the world does to us as Christians what it did to Jesus in his life and death,
[3042.98 → 3048.50] it can only be because when they look at us, they see Jesus.
[3050.54 → 3056.08] If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, Peter says,
[3056.32 → 3060.08] for the spirit of glory and of God rests on you.
[3060.08 → 3067.62] Have you ever been made fun of for being Christian?
[3068.78 → 3072.60] Have you ever been looked down on or been ridiculed for being Christian?
[3072.68 → 3079.82] Have you ever been passed over for a promotion or not gotten a job because you don't fit the company culture
[3079.82 → 3084.12] that has the idolatry of busyness and profit at any cost?
[3084.12 → 3089.22] Or have your teammates not invited you to the after party?
[3089.64 → 3094.24] Or have your teammates gotten quiet when you walk into the locker room after the game
[3094.24 → 3096.28] just because you've entered that space?
[3097.46 → 3104.90] Or how about a family member who just doesn't get it when you're starting to grow in faith?
[3105.26 → 3108.60] Who just doesn't understand your new Christian faith?
[3109.48 → 3112.62] When these things happen to you, what do you feel?
[3112.62 → 3116.00] What's going on in your heart at that moment?
[3116.80 → 3121.92] And to be frank, if those things never happen to you, why not?
[3130.96 → 3134.78] Do you rejoice when you're ridiculed?
[3135.30 → 3138.00] Do you feel blessed when you are insulted?
[3138.28 → 3139.62] Do you glorify God?
[3139.62 → 3139.64] Do you glorify God?
[3142.62 → 3146.20] Or do you get scared?
[3148.70 → 3155.32] Are you ashamed or embarrassed and worried about what they might be thinking of you?
[3160.84 → 3164.76] We're going to live in that tension for a little while this morning.
[3164.76 → 3170.70] To help us live in that tension, I want you to hear this.
[3172.94 → 3176.22] The glory of Jesus in the cross
[3176.22 → 3181.78] is the same as the glory of Jesus in the crown.
[3182.64 → 3185.10] Now, I'm going to use that image and that phrase
[3185.10 → 3186.90] for the rest of our time together this morning.
[3186.90 → 3191.46] So, let it situate and land and percolate in your mind space, right?
[3191.50 → 3193.12] The cross and the crown.
[3194.88 → 3195.58] Here's what I mean.
[3195.64 → 3198.54] The glory of Jesus in the crown, right,
[3198.60 → 3200.46] is referenced to his resurrection,
[3200.98 → 3202.58] to his exaltation.
[3202.84 → 3205.86] The glory of Jesus in the crown is the empty tomb
[3205.86 → 3208.78] and his ascension to the right hand of the Father.
[3208.78 → 3213.72] The glory of Jesus in the crown is his return to this world as king
[3213.72 → 3216.24] over all creation in the consummation,
[3216.56 → 3217.68] the end of history,
[3217.94 → 3221.44] when that celestial city comes down forever
[3221.44 → 3223.72] and heaven and earth are one
[3223.72 → 3224.70] and there is no temple
[3224.70 → 3226.58] because God has made his dwelling among us
[3226.58 → 3231.32] and Jesus lives here with us as face to face.
[3231.32 → 3233.92] That's the glory of the crown.
[3235.68 → 3236.04] And,
[3236.60 → 3242.80] and there is glory in the cross.
[3243.80 → 3248.46] The glory in the cross is his suffering, right?
[3248.50 → 3250.52] There's glory in his agony.
[3250.78 → 3252.74] There's glory in his death.
[3252.90 → 3255.52] There is glory in Jesus emptying himself
[3255.52 → 3257.78] and taking on the nature of a slave.
[3257.94 → 3261.30] There is glory in him becoming obedient unto death.
[3261.74 → 3263.74] Even death on the cross.
[3263.82 → 3264.12] And in fact,
[3264.36 → 3266.08] let me just stay right there for a minute, right?
[3266.14 → 3267.48] Here in Philippians 2,
[3268.80 → 3269.40] Paul writes,
[3269.86 → 3270.22] Jesus,
[3271.38 → 3273.82] being in very nature God,
[3274.14 → 3276.06] did not consider equality with God
[3276.06 → 3278.12] something to be used for his own advantage.
[3278.78 → 3279.04] Rather,
[3279.26 → 3280.68] he made himself nothing
[3280.68 → 3283.20] by taking on the very nature of a slave,
[3283.58 → 3286.02] being made in human likeness.
[3286.02 → 3288.36] And being found in appearance as a man,
[3288.46 → 3289.56] he humbled himself
[3289.56 → 3292.52] by becoming obedient unto death.
[3292.68 → 3294.48] Even death on the cross.
[3294.60 → 3294.82] And then,
[3295.16 → 3295.84] hear this word,
[3296.40 → 3297.02] therefore.
[3299.56 → 3301.90] God exalted him to the highest place
[3301.90 → 3302.88] and gave him the name
[3302.88 → 3304.80] that is above every name.
[3305.72 → 3306.42] Now hear that, right?
[3306.54 → 3308.64] He became obedient unto death.
[3308.64 → 3309.92] Even death on a cross.
[3310.10 → 3310.88] And therefore,
[3311.40 → 3311.56] right?
[3311.64 → 3312.02] Therefore,
[3312.02 → 3313.82] because of that,
[3314.18 → 3315.42] God exalted him
[3315.42 → 3316.64] to the highest place.
[3317.36 → 3318.92] The glory of the cross
[3318.92 → 3320.34] is the road
[3320.34 → 3321.74] to the glory of the crown.
[3322.54 → 3324.88] The cross precedes the crown.
[3325.02 → 3326.12] There is no resurrection
[3326.12 → 3327.26] without the cross.
[3327.40 → 3328.62] There is no exaltation
[3328.62 → 3329.50] without the cross.
[3329.62 → 3331.36] There is no seated at the right hand
[3331.36 → 3332.44] of God the Father Almighty
[3332.44 → 3333.54] without the cross.
[3333.66 → 3335.84] There is no celestial city come down
[3335.84 → 3337.14] without the cross.
[3337.14 → 3338.76] The glory of the cross
[3338.76 → 3340.92] precedes the glory of the crown.
[3342.06 → 3344.10] And you shouldn't be surprised
[3344.10 → 3346.26] that it's the same way for you.
[3349.30 → 3349.92] And yeah,
[3350.22 → 3352.02] real talk for a moment, right?
[3352.26 → 3353.38] Most of us
[3353.38 → 3355.08] want the glory of the crown
[3355.08 → 3357.88] without the cross.
[3359.52 → 3360.04] Right?
[3360.04 → 3365.20] We want the whole rich reward
[3365.20 → 3367.38] without counting the cost.
[3368.12 → 3370.30] We want the transformed life
[3370.30 → 3371.62] of abundance and prosperity
[3371.62 → 3372.92] without the death
[3372.92 → 3375.12] that must come first.
[3376.34 → 3377.90] But the glory of the cross
[3377.90 → 3378.88] is what brings
[3378.88 → 3380.00] the glory of the crown.
[3381.56 → 3382.76] Let me be really clear
[3382.76 → 3383.48] about this, right?
[3383.60 → 3384.42] As Christians,
[3384.68 → 3387.12] we are living in hope.
[3387.26 → 3388.98] We have a living hope.
[3388.98 → 3389.72] As Christians,
[3389.88 → 3390.74] there is a peace
[3390.74 → 3391.76] that surpasses
[3391.76 → 3392.96] all understanding.
[3393.36 → 3393.88] As Christians,
[3394.02 → 3395.16] we know and believe
[3395.16 → 3396.28] that there is a blessing
[3396.28 → 3397.90] that is waiting for you
[3397.90 → 3398.82] from God.
[3399.26 → 3399.62] But,
[3400.66 → 3401.72] it is not
[3401.72 → 3403.84] your best life now.
[3405.22 → 3405.98] It is not
[3405.98 → 3408.54] the word of faith movement,
[3408.80 → 3410.58] the name it and claim it idea
[3410.58 → 3412.12] of the new prosperity gospel.
[3412.56 → 3413.36] It is not
[3413.36 → 3414.12] the idea
[3414.12 → 3414.76] that Jesus
[3414.76 → 3416.20] just wants to reveal
[3416.20 → 3417.06] what's been hiding
[3417.06 → 3417.86] inside of you
[3417.86 → 3418.74] all along.
[3418.98 → 3421.06] the crown
[3421.06 → 3422.14] comes
[3422.14 → 3423.72] at the cross
[3423.72 → 3425.34] and with the cross.
[3426.30 → 3427.32] If you are
[3427.32 → 3428.12] insulted
[3428.12 → 3429.20] because of the name
[3429.20 → 3429.66] of Christ,
[3429.82 → 3430.86] you are blessed
[3430.86 → 3431.86] for the spirit
[3431.86 → 3432.40] of glory
[3432.40 → 3433.02] and of God
[3433.02 → 3434.22] rests on you.
[3434.38 → 3435.66] The same spirit
[3435.66 → 3436.46] of glory
[3436.46 → 3437.14] and of God
[3437.14 → 3437.78] who descended
[3437.78 → 3438.54] on Jesus
[3438.54 → 3439.70] when he condescended
[3439.70 → 3440.48] down to us
[3440.48 → 3441.70] and went to the cross
[3441.70 → 3442.86] is now also
[3442.86 → 3444.16] descended on you
[3444.16 → 3445.78] and in you.
[3445.78 → 3449.42] the apostles
[3449.42 → 3451.38] in the early church
[3451.38 → 3453.10] they got this.
[3453.86 → 3454.82] There is a story
[3454.82 → 3456.78] in the book of Acts
[3456.78 → 3457.94] written by Luke
[3457.94 → 3459.28] accounting for the
[3459.28 → 3460.00] development
[3460.00 → 3460.66] and the rise
[3460.66 → 3461.40] of the early church
[3461.40 → 3462.64] and in Acts 5
[3462.64 → 3463.70] the apostles
[3463.70 → 3465.18] of Jesus
[3465.18 → 3465.92] now filled
[3465.92 → 3466.74] with the Holy Spirit
[3466.74 → 3467.32] are called
[3467.32 → 3467.92] to face
[3467.92 → 3468.86] the Sanhedrin.
[3468.86 → 3469.90] The Sanhedrin
[3469.90 → 3470.28] are the
[3470.28 → 3471.84] the religion-political
[3471.84 → 3472.96] ruling class
[3472.96 → 3473.90] in Jerusalem
[3473.90 → 3476.02] and the apostles
[3476.02 → 3476.46] come
[3476.46 → 3477.00] and they are
[3477.00 → 3477.96] flogged
[3477.96 → 3478.96] by the rulers
[3478.96 → 3479.68] and they are ordered
[3479.68 → 3480.36] not to preach
[3480.36 → 3481.16] the name of Jesus
[3481.16 → 3482.06] and then Luke
[3482.06 → 3483.08] writes in Acts 5
[3483.08 → 3483.52] 41
[3483.52 → 3484.62] the apostles
[3484.62 → 3486.10] left the Sanhedrin
[3486.10 → 3487.54] rejoicing
[3487.54 → 3489.18] because they had
[3489.18 → 3489.64] been counted
[3489.64 → 3490.26] worthy
[3490.26 → 3491.48] of suffering
[3491.48 → 3492.48] disgrace
[3492.48 → 3493.78] for the name.
[3496.00 → 3496.60] Preaching
[3496.60 → 3497.56] the full gospel
[3497.56 → 3498.62] of Jesus
[3498.62 → 3499.82] the substitutionary
[3499.82 → 3500.24] atonement
[3500.24 → 3501.14] and the victory
[3501.14 → 3501.58] of God
[3501.58 → 3502.36] the cross
[3502.36 → 3503.26] and the crown
[3503.26 → 3504.72] will always be
[3504.72 → 3505.36] folly
[3505.36 → 3506.60] and a stumbling block
[3506.60 → 3507.26] to those who
[3507.26 → 3508.18] don't believe
[3508.18 → 3509.14] but to those
[3509.14 → 3510.64] who are being saved
[3510.64 → 3511.50] it is the power
[3511.50 → 3512.02] of God
[3512.02 → 3512.82] and the wisdom
[3512.82 → 3513.32] of God.
[3514.38 → 3515.78] Paul says in Romans
[3515.78 → 3516.28] 1
[3516.28 → 3517.66] I am not ashamed
[3517.66 → 3518.46] of the gospel
[3518.46 → 3519.70] because it is the power
[3519.70 → 3521.12] of God unto salvation
[3521.12 → 3522.48] for all who believe.
[3523.92 → 3525.18] Instead of shame
[3525.18 → 3525.90] in the cross
[3525.90 → 3526.78] we can rejoice
[3526.78 → 3527.96] in suffering.
[3528.80 → 3529.52] Listen again
[3529.52 → 3531.12] to what the scriptures say.
[3532.40 → 3533.02] We boast
[3533.02 → 3534.02] in the hope
[3534.02 → 3535.28] of the glory of God.
[3535.38 → 3536.18] That's the crown
[3536.18 → 3537.60] not only so
[3537.60 → 3538.70] but we also glory
[3538.70 → 3539.76] in our sufferings
[3539.76 → 3540.52] because we know
[3540.52 → 3541.18] that suffering
[3541.18 → 3542.32] produces perseverance
[3542.32 → 3543.16] perseverance
[3543.16 → 3543.82] character
[3543.82 → 3544.68] and character
[3544.68 → 3545.38] hope.
[3546.66 → 3547.84] That's the cross.
[3548.98 → 3550.48] The spirit himself
[3550.48 → 3552.24] testifies with our spirits
[3552.24 → 3553.54] that we are children
[3553.54 → 3554.12] of God
[3554.12 → 3555.56] and now if we are children
[3555.56 → 3556.74] then we are heirs.
[3556.90 → 3557.74] Heirs of God
[3557.74 → 3558.58] and co-heirs
[3558.58 → 3559.56] with Christ.
[3560.02 → 3560.66] Now that is one
[3560.66 → 3561.84] of my favourite lines
[3561.84 → 3562.94] in all scripture.
[3563.30 → 3564.12] We are children.
[3564.36 → 3565.06] If we are children
[3565.06 → 3565.88] then we are heirs.
[3566.08 → 3566.86] Heirs of God
[3566.86 → 3568.16] and co-heirs with Christ.
[3568.16 → 3569.26] But even I
[3569.26 → 3571.22] forget the second part
[3571.22 → 3571.72] of that line.
[3573.16 → 3573.92] If indeed
[3573.92 → 3576.50] we share in his sufferings
[3576.50 → 3579.10] in order that we may also
[3579.10 → 3580.04] share in his glory.
[3582.04 → 3582.72] Children
[3582.72 → 3585.40] who share in the cross
[3585.40 → 3587.06] will share in the crown.
[3587.06 → 3591.60] But beloved
[3591.60 → 3593.56] be wary
[3593.56 → 3594.76] of so-called
[3594.76 → 3595.54] Bible teachers
[3595.54 → 3597.30] who will tell you
[3597.30 → 3598.28] that you can have
[3598.28 → 3598.96] the crown
[3598.96 → 3600.92] without the cross.
[3602.40 → 3604.16] Do not be surprised
[3604.16 → 3605.70] that this test
[3605.70 → 3607.02] has come upon you.
[3608.62 → 3609.64] Jesus lived
[3609.64 → 3610.06] the life
[3610.06 → 3610.76] I should have lived
[3610.76 → 3611.66] and died the death
[3611.66 → 3612.60] that I deserved
[3612.60 → 3613.32] and by grace
[3613.32 → 3614.12] through faith
[3614.12 → 3615.60] as the gift
[3615.60 → 3616.14] of God
[3616.14 → 3617.22] he grants me
[3617.22 → 3618.42] the righteousness
[3618.42 → 3619.36] of Jesus
[3619.36 → 3621.78] and by the gift
[3621.78 → 3622.40] of grace
[3622.40 → 3623.78] he declares you
[3623.78 → 3624.72] a righteous
[3624.72 → 3626.52] child of God.
[3626.86 → 3627.72] He names you
[3627.72 → 3628.40] a son
[3628.40 → 3629.46] and a daughter.
[3630.38 → 3631.06] He calls you
[3631.06 → 3631.78] his own
[3631.78 → 3634.40] and that grace
[3634.40 → 3637.12] oh that amazing
[3637.12 → 3638.16] grace
[3638.16 → 3639.40] is free
[3639.40 → 3640.50] to you.
[3642.24 → 3643.60] But make no mistake
[3643.60 → 3644.44] it's not cheap.
[3645.60 → 3646.64] That grace
[3646.64 → 3647.48] cost Jesus
[3647.48 → 3648.28] everything.
[3650.54 → 3651.58] That grace
[3651.58 → 3653.90] is what led
[3653.90 → 3654.90] Jesus to the cross.
[3655.98 → 3656.90] And now
[3656.90 → 3657.42] you
[3657.42 → 3659.12] don't
[3659.12 → 3659.96] cheapen
[3659.96 → 3661.08] the cross
[3661.08 → 3662.22] because you
[3662.22 → 3663.00] aren't willing
[3663.00 → 3663.84] as a disciple
[3663.84 → 3665.06] to count the cost.
[3666.02 → 3666.62] The grace
[3666.62 → 3667.10] of God
[3667.10 → 3667.94] is absolutely
[3667.94 → 3668.74] and utterly
[3668.74 → 3669.60] free.
[3671.14 → 3672.80] But being a Christian
[3672.80 → 3674.06] may cost you
[3674.06 → 3674.62] your life.
[3676.10 → 3676.56] Now that's not
[3676.56 → 3677.10] a reality
[3677.10 → 3678.04] that many of us
[3678.04 → 3678.96] are familiar with.
[3680.38 → 3681.34] But being a Christian
[3681.34 → 3681.94] may cost you
[3681.94 → 3682.42] your job.
[3683.94 → 3684.96] I know some of you
[3684.96 → 3685.36] are familiar
[3685.36 → 3686.08] with that reality.
[3687.44 → 3688.02] Being a Christian
[3688.02 → 3688.64] may cost you
[3688.64 → 3689.42] your popularity.
[3689.98 → 3690.50] It may cost you
[3690.50 → 3690.96] your power.
[3691.28 → 3691.86] It may cost you
[3691.86 → 3692.42] your status.
[3692.68 → 3693.42] It may cost you
[3693.42 → 3694.16] your vacation.
[3696.16 → 3696.86] Being a Christian
[3696.86 → 3698.30] will cost you
[3698.30 → 3699.78] whatever crown
[3699.78 → 3701.00] of fading glory
[3701.00 → 3702.04] you are choosing
[3702.04 → 3703.72] instead of Jesus.
[3704.72 → 3705.92] Whatever prosperity
[3705.92 → 3706.96] you are pursuing
[3706.96 → 3707.96] in place of the
[3707.96 → 3709.02] imperishable crown
[3709.02 → 3709.90] of glory
[3709.90 → 3711.04] Jesus provides.
[3715.68 → 3716.70] And whatever
[3716.70 → 3717.90] it costs you
[3717.90 → 3719.44] whether it is
[3719.44 → 3719.92] your life
[3719.92 → 3720.76] your job
[3720.76 → 3721.36] your status
[3721.36 → 3722.12] your power
[3722.12 → 3722.64] even if it's
[3722.64 → 3723.52] your vacation
[3723.52 → 3724.86] whatever it costs
[3724.86 → 3725.24] you
[3725.24 → 3726.66] it
[3726.66 → 3727.80] is
[3727.80 → 3729.04] worth it.
[3729.04 → 3730.88] right that crown
[3730.88 → 3732.58] that future reality
[3732.58 → 3733.74] lived with God
[3733.74 → 3734.26] in Jesus
[3734.26 → 3735.28] face to face
[3735.28 → 3736.20] is really
[3736.20 → 3736.90] truly
[3736.90 → 3737.94] eternally
[3737.94 → 3738.96] worth it.
[3740.72 → 3741.90] The cross
[3741.90 → 3743.22] and the crown
[3743.22 → 3745.16] they come together
[3745.16 → 3745.92] in the life
[3745.92 → 3746.34] death
[3746.34 → 3746.98] resurrection
[3746.98 → 3747.92] and exaltation
[3747.92 → 3749.06] of Jesus
[3749.06 → 3750.52] and do not be
[3750.52 → 3751.14] surprised
[3751.14 → 3752.84] when it is so
[3752.84 → 3753.54] for you
[3753.54 → 3754.54] too.
[3754.54 → 3757.52] if you are
[3757.52 → 3757.98] insulted
[3757.98 → 3758.62] because of the
[3758.62 → 3759.24] name of Christ
[3759.24 → 3760.14] you are
[3760.14 → 3760.84] blessed.
[3761.02 → 3761.48] Do you believe
[3761.48 → 3762.30] that this morning?
[3763.02 → 3764.18] If you suffer
[3764.18 → 3765.14] as a Christian
[3765.14 → 3766.32] do not be ashamed
[3766.32 → 3767.68] but praise God
[3767.68 → 3768.38] that you bear
[3768.38 → 3768.80] that name.
[3768.90 → 3769.68] Can you do that
[3769.68 → 3770.64] this morning?
[3772.68 → 3773.20] Remember
[3773.20 → 3774.14] the very words
[3774.14 → 3774.68] of Jesus
[3774.68 → 3775.78] Jesus who says
[3775.78 → 3777.20] blessed are you
[3777.20 → 3777.96] when people
[3777.96 → 3778.84] insult you
[3778.84 → 3779.92] and persecute you
[3779.92 → 3780.62] and falsely say
[3780.62 → 3781.50] all kinds of evil
[3781.50 → 3781.98] against you
[3781.98 → 3782.60] because of me
[3782.60 → 3784.16] rejoice and be glad
[3784.16 → 3785.00] because great
[3785.00 → 3786.22] is your reward
[3786.22 → 3786.94] in heaven
[3786.94 → 3787.52] the cross
[3787.52 → 3788.34] and the crown
[3788.34 → 3788.70] again
[3788.70 → 3790.12] for in the same way
[3790.12 → 3791.00] they persecuted
[3791.00 → 3791.70] the prophets
[3791.70 → 3792.92] who were before you.
[3793.52 → 3794.74] The glory of the cross
[3794.74 → 3795.72] and the glory
[3795.72 → 3796.40] of the crown
[3796.40 → 3798.66] in that order.
[3799.70 → 3800.38] That
[3800.38 → 3801.90] is the right
[3801.90 → 3803.10] struggle.
[3804.30 → 3804.84] Don't settle
[3804.84 → 3806.60] for a lesser crown
[3806.60 → 3807.20] because
[3807.20 → 3808.44] you are ashamed
[3808.44 → 3809.16] of the cross.
[3810.16 → 3810.92] Don't settle
[3810.92 → 3811.92] for a lesser crown
[3811.92 → 3812.30] because
[3812.30 → 3813.74] you are afraid
[3813.74 → 3814.96] of the cross.
[3815.22 → 3816.12] Don't be ashamed
[3816.12 → 3816.80] of the gospel
[3816.80 → 3818.06] but declare it
[3818.06 → 3820.40] and if you suffer
[3820.40 → 3822.04] or maybe better
[3822.04 → 3822.80] when
[3822.80 → 3824.32] you suffer
[3824.32 → 3826.64] know this
[3826.64 → 3827.44] that we
[3827.44 → 3828.32] suffer
[3828.32 → 3829.64] with you.
[3830.72 → 3831.46] The trial
[3831.46 → 3832.36] and the test
[3832.36 → 3833.66] isn't for you
[3833.66 → 3834.26] alone
[3834.26 → 3835.44] because you are
[3835.44 → 3836.16] not alone.
[3837.78 → 3838.54] Not only
[3838.54 → 3839.66] does the spirit
[3839.66 → 3840.38] of the glory
[3840.38 → 3840.82] of God
[3840.82 → 3841.82] rest on you
[3841.82 → 3843.50] and go
[3843.50 → 3844.30] in you
[3844.30 → 3845.40] and with you
[3845.40 → 3846.34] but we
[3846.34 → 3847.84] go
[3847.84 → 3849.20] with you.
[3849.30 → 3849.80] We all
[3849.80 → 3850.50] go
[3850.50 → 3851.44] together
[3851.44 → 3854.32] and we all
[3854.32 → 3855.08] Paul writes
[3855.08 → 3856.34] with unveiled
[3856.34 → 3856.86] face
[3856.86 → 3857.96] beholding the glory
[3857.96 → 3858.48] of the Lord
[3858.48 → 3859.58] are being transformed
[3859.58 → 3861.12] into the same image
[3861.12 → 3861.98] from one degree
[3861.98 → 3862.66] of glory
[3862.66 → 3863.74] to another
[3863.74 → 3864.60] for this
[3864.60 → 3865.78] comes from the Lord
[3865.78 → 3866.76] who is
[3866.76 → 3867.56] the spirit.
[3867.56 → 3870.00] Do not be surprised
[3870.00 → 3871.84] when your crown
[3871.84 → 3872.90] comes through
[3872.90 → 3873.72] a cross.
[3875.00 → 3875.54] Instead
[3875.54 → 3877.32] surprise them
[3877.32 → 3878.88] by rejoicing
[3878.88 → 3880.16] in that struggle
[3880.16 → 3882.00] in the right struggle.
[3882.00 → 3888.98] if you suffer
[3888.98 → 3890.02] Peter writes
[3890.02 → 3892.10] it should not be
[3892.10 → 3892.72] as a murderer
[3892.72 → 3893.84] or a thief
[3893.84 → 3895.10] or any kind
[3895.10 → 3895.92] of criminal
[3895.92 → 3897.78] or even
[3897.78 → 3899.54] as a meddler.
[3900.70 → 3901.16] I want to be
[3901.16 → 3901.82] really clear
[3901.82 → 3902.36] with us
[3902.36 → 3902.92] this morning
[3902.92 → 3903.28] because
[3903.28 → 3904.30] there's a lot
[3904.30 → 3904.90] of talk
[3904.90 → 3905.36] happening
[3905.36 → 3906.08] right now
[3906.08 → 3907.12] about the struggle
[3907.12 → 3908.12] that Christians
[3908.12 → 3908.80] are facing.
[3909.60 → 3910.00] There's a lot
[3910.00 → 3910.40] of talk
[3910.40 → 3911.34] about rights
[3911.34 → 3912.20] and freedoms
[3912.20 → 3912.94] my rights
[3912.94 → 3913.76] and your freedoms
[3913.76 → 3914.96] and the like
[3914.96 → 3915.56] and there's a lot
[3915.56 → 3916.04] of talk
[3916.04 → 3917.22] about the infringement
[3917.22 → 3919.14] of those rights.
[3922.32 → 3923.02] That
[3923.02 → 3924.70] is not
[3924.70 → 3926.24] the same
[3926.24 → 3927.54] as persecution.
[3933.18 → 3934.10] But even
[3934.10 → 3934.88] if it was
[3934.88 → 3937.00] there's so much
[3937.00 → 3937.34] more.
[3938.30 → 3939.06] That Greek
[3939.06 → 3939.46] word
[3939.46 → 3940.34] meddler
[3940.34 → 3940.74] there
[3940.74 → 3940.96] that
[3940.96 → 3941.40] if you
[3941.40 → 3941.52] are
[3941.52 → 3942.00] insulted
[3942.00 → 3942.44] if you
[3942.44 → 3942.80] suffer
[3942.80 → 3942.94] it
[3942.94 → 3943.06] should
[3943.06 → 3943.22] not
[3943.22 → 3943.32] be
[3943.32 → 3943.44] as
[3943.44 → 3943.56] a
[3943.56 → 3943.78] murderer
[3943.78 → 3944.10] okay
[3944.10 → 3944.72] we get that
[3944.72 → 3945.18] should not be
[3945.18 → 3945.64] as a thief
[3945.64 → 3946.02] okay
[3946.02 → 3946.82] yeah we get
[3946.82 → 3947.10] that
[3947.10 → 3947.76] we're not
[3947.76 → 3948.58] going to steal
[3948.58 → 3949.12] or kill
[3949.12 → 3949.56] sure
[3949.56 → 3951.20] or be any
[3951.20 → 3951.66] other kind
[3951.66 → 3952.10] of criminal
[3952.10 → 3953.52] Lord willing
[3953.52 → 3954.98] or even
[3954.98 → 3956.22] as a meddler.
[3957.90 → 3958.70] Now that word
[3958.70 → 3959.30] meddler
[3959.30 → 3959.90] is not really
[3959.90 → 3960.92] common to us
[3960.92 → 3962.26] in English
[3962.26 → 3963.70] the Greek word
[3963.70 → 3965.42] actually means
[3965.42 → 3965.74] like
[3965.74 → 3966.92] busy body
[3966.92 → 3968.84] right
[3968.84 → 3969.76] involving
[3969.76 → 3970.46] yourself
[3970.46 → 3970.94] in the
[3970.94 → 3971.36] affairs
[3971.36 → 3972.18] of others
[3972.18 → 3973.54] without
[3973.54 → 3974.26] expertise
[3974.26 → 3975.02] or warrant
[3975.02 → 3977.58] that's the
[3977.58 → 3978.00] definition
[3978.00 → 3978.58] of meddler
[3978.58 → 3984.70] that
[3984.70 → 3986.68] is common
[3986.68 → 3987.78] in the world
[3987.78 → 3988.24] right now
[3988.24 → 3990.84] and we
[3990.84 → 3991.42] are not
[3991.42 → 3991.76] exempt
[3991.76 → 3992.30] from that
[3992.30 → 3992.74] charge
[3992.74 → 3993.52] involving
[3993.52 → 3993.92] yourselves
[3993.92 → 3994.16] in the
[3994.16 → 3994.42] affairs
[3994.42 → 3994.82] of others
[3994.82 → 3995.10] without
[3995.10 → 3995.74] expertise
[3995.74 → 3996.98] or warrant
[3996.98 → 3999.14] if you
[3999.14 → 3999.74] suffer
[3999.74 → 4001.40] don't suffer
[4001.40 → 4001.76] for being
[4001.76 → 4002.26] a meddler
[4002.26 → 4003.94] suffer
[4003.94 → 4004.66] for declaring
[4004.66 → 4005.30] the gospel
[4005.30 → 4007.18] if we're
[4007.18 → 4007.40] going to
[4007.40 → 4007.76] entertain
[4007.76 → 4008.32] trials
[4008.32 → 4008.94] and tests
[4008.94 → 4009.52] and be
[4009.52 → 4009.84] able to
[4009.84 → 4010.28] rejoice
[4010.28 → 4010.96] in the
[4010.96 → 4011.16] midst
[4011.16 → 4011.52] of them
[4011.52 → 4011.96] let it
[4011.96 → 4012.30] not be
[4012.30 → 4012.60] because
[4012.60 → 4012.84] we're
[4012.84 → 4013.46] crying
[4013.46 → 4013.98] about
[4013.98 → 4014.54] rights
[4014.54 → 4014.90] that may
[4014.90 → 4015.24] have been
[4015.24 → 4015.64] mitigated
[4015.64 → 4016.06] or taken
[4016.06 → 4016.38] away
[4016.38 → 4016.86] let it
[4016.86 → 4016.98] be
[4016.98 → 4017.34] because
[4017.34 → 4017.88] we
[4017.88 → 4018.14] are
[4018.14 → 4018.80] standing
[4018.80 → 4019.14] with
[4019.14 → 4019.80] Jesus
[4019.80 → 4026.72] now I
[4026.72 → 4026.86] do
[4026.86 → 4027.44] believe
[4027.44 → 4028.90] that a
[4028.90 → 4029.22] time is
[4029.22 → 4029.52] coming
[4029.52 → 4030.02] and maybe
[4030.02 → 4030.68] has already
[4030.68 → 4031.04] come
[4031.04 → 4031.30] when
[4031.30 → 4032.84] real
[4032.84 → 4033.82] both
[4033.82 → 4034.50] soft
[4034.50 → 4035.00] and
[4035.00 → 4036.32] actual
[4036.32 → 4037.10] persecution
[4037.10 → 4038.30] will happen
[4038.30 → 4039.16] for Christians
[4039.16 → 4039.92] in the world
[4039.92 → 4040.20] today
[4040.20 → 4041.04] and I do
[4041.04 → 4041.40] believe
[4041.40 → 4041.72] that there
[4041.72 → 4042.04] is a
[4042.04 → 4042.62] generation
[4042.62 → 4043.70] of Christians
[4043.70 → 4044.76] rising up
[4044.76 → 4045.28] right now
[4045.28 → 4045.72] who will
[4045.72 → 4046.10] have to
[4046.10 → 4046.80] face this
[4046.80 → 4047.26] because
[4047.26 → 4047.82] the reality
[4047.82 → 4048.10] is
[4048.10 → 4048.66] for those
[4048.66 → 4048.96] of you
[4048.96 → 4049.44] who are
[4049.44 → 4050.22] over 50
[4050.22 → 4050.88] or especially
[4050.88 → 4051.30] those of you
[4051.30 → 4051.52] who are
[4051.52 → 4052.30] over 60
[4052.30 → 4053.84] you will
[4053.84 → 4054.52] in large
[4054.52 → 4054.92] part
[4054.92 → 4055.48] because of
[4055.48 → 4055.88] your
[4055.88 → 4057.30] status
[4057.30 → 4057.94] and relative
[4057.94 → 4058.56] comfort
[4058.56 → 4059.06] and your
[4059.06 → 4059.74] community
[4059.74 → 4061.00] situated ness
[4061.00 → 4061.56] you will
[4061.56 → 4061.92] be able
[4061.92 → 4062.74] to insulate
[4062.74 → 4063.24] yourselves
[4063.24 → 4063.94] from this
[4063.94 → 4064.56] new cultural
[4064.56 → 4064.98] norm
[4064.98 → 4066.92] it's the
[4066.92 → 4067.60] young people
[4067.60 → 4068.56] it's the
[4068.56 → 4069.06] 20s
[4069.06 → 4069.92] and 30s
[4069.92 → 4070.30] it's you
[4070.30 → 4070.94] teenagers
[4070.94 → 4072.02] right now
[4072.02 → 4072.52] who are
[4072.52 → 4073.08] really going
[4073.08 → 4073.40] to have
[4073.40 → 4074.02] to endure
[4074.02 → 4075.06] this test
[4075.06 → 4076.20] and learn
[4076.20 → 4076.58] how to
[4076.58 → 4077.22] stand
[4077.22 → 4080.10] I want
[4080.10 → 4080.24] to be
[4080.24 → 4080.40] really
[4080.40 → 4080.64] clear
[4080.64 → 4081.12] I have
[4081.12 → 4081.66] hope
[4081.66 → 4083.34] and I
[4083.34 → 4083.76] have hope
[4083.76 → 4084.38] not because
[4084.38 → 4084.72] I know
[4084.72 → 4085.30] all of you
[4085.30 → 4085.78] although I
[4085.78 → 4086.56] know many
[4086.56 → 4086.94] of you
[4086.94 → 4087.30] and you
[4087.30 → 4087.62] give me
[4087.62 → 4088.12] reason to
[4088.12 → 4088.68] be excited
[4088.68 → 4089.44] I have
[4089.44 → 4089.78] hope
[4089.78 → 4090.26] because
[4090.26 → 4091.20] I know
[4091.20 → 4091.88] Jesus
[4091.88 → 4093.42] I have
[4093.42 → 4093.64] hope
[4093.64 → 4093.98] because
[4093.98 → 4094.80] the spirit
[4094.80 → 4095.70] of glory
[4095.70 → 4096.16] and of
[4096.16 → 4096.52] God
[4096.52 → 4097.14] rests
[4097.14 → 4098.02] on us
[4098.02 → 4098.34] and it
[4098.34 → 4098.68] is in
[4098.68 → 4099.50] him
[4099.50 → 4100.34] that my
[4100.34 → 4100.60] hope
[4100.60 → 4101.14] is found
[4101.14 → 4101.60] first
[4101.60 → 4102.46] and always
[4102.46 → 4102.88] in
[4102.88 → 4103.64] God
[4103.64 → 4104.16] and so
[4104.16 → 4104.98] I believe
[4104.98 → 4105.58] and I
[4105.58 → 4105.96] know
[4105.96 → 4106.56] that God
[4106.56 → 4107.80] will always
[4107.80 → 4108.44] allow his
[4108.44 → 4108.84] church
[4108.84 → 4109.98] to persevere
[4109.98 → 4114.64] but I
[4114.64 → 4115.18] want us
[4115.18 → 4116.68] not just
[4116.68 → 4117.62] to have
[4117.62 → 4118.18] hope
[4118.18 → 4119.28] in an
[4119.28 → 4119.68] unseen
[4119.68 → 4120.20] future
[4120.20 → 4122.02] but to
[4122.02 → 4122.60] be
[4122.60 → 4123.16] that
[4123.16 → 4123.90] visible
[4123.90 → 4125.02] hope
[4125.02 → 4125.78] in the
[4125.78 → 4126.08] world
[4126.08 → 4128.44] you
[4128.44 → 4129.30] can be
[4129.30 → 4129.62] that
[4129.62 → 4130.34] generation
[4130.34 → 4131.74] that rises
[4131.74 → 4132.40] up
[4132.40 → 4133.48] as the
[4133.48 → 4133.98] song says
[4133.98 → 4135.24] with selfless
[4135.24 → 4136.18] faith
[4136.18 → 4138.44] we can
[4138.44 → 4138.76] be
[4138.76 → 4139.02] that
[4139.02 → 4139.74] generation
[4139.74 → 4140.46] of
[4140.46 → 4140.88] Christian
[4140.88 → 4141.18] that
[4141.18 → 4141.90] declares
[4141.90 → 4142.90] the gospel
[4142.90 → 4143.50] of Jesus
[4143.50 → 4144.70] and rejoices
[4144.70 → 4145.76] in our
[4145.76 → 4146.62] suffering
[4146.62 → 4147.12] and our
[4147.12 → 4147.54] trials
[4147.54 → 4148.08] and our
[4148.08 → 4148.48] testing
[4148.48 → 4149.58] because we
[4149.58 → 4150.46] know
[4150.46 → 4152.62] that when
[4152.62 → 4153.04] we face
[4153.04 → 4154.08] trials of
[4154.08 → 4154.88] any
[4154.88 → 4155.52] kind
[4155.52 → 4155.98] it is
[4155.98 → 4156.52] because
[4156.52 → 4157.20] we
[4157.20 → 4157.84] look
[4157.84 → 4158.86] like
[4158.86 → 4160.14] Jesus
[4160.14 → 4160.36] Jesus
[4160.36 → 4163.22] and so
[4163.22 → 4163.70] generation
[4163.70 → 4163.98] of
[4163.98 → 4164.44] Christians
[4164.44 → 4165.54] go
[4165.54 → 4166.36] from this
[4166.36 → 4166.82] place
[4166.82 → 4167.48] looking
[4167.48 → 4168.36] like
[4168.36 → 4169.36] Jesus
[4169.36 → 4171.38] and do
[4171.38 → 4171.66] not be
[4171.66 → 4172.32] surprised
[4172.32 → 4174.18] but instead
[4174.18 → 4176.30] be encouraged
[4176.30 → 4177.62] not be
[4177.62 → 4178.10] afraid
[4178.10 → 4179.68] but instead
[4179.68 → 4181.20] rejoice
[4181.20 → 4184.04] do not
[4184.04 → 4184.48] worry
[4184.48 → 4186.06] but instead
[4186.06 → 4187.54] boldly
[4187.54 → 4188.38] proclaim
[4188.38 → 4189.68] the kingdom
[4189.68 → 4190.60] come
[4190.60 → 4191.26] and the
[4191.26 → 4191.60] kingdom
[4191.60 → 4192.66] coming
[4192.66 → 4195.14] there is
[4195.14 → 4195.64] glory
[4195.64 → 4196.14] in the
[4196.14 → 4196.62] cross
[4196.62 → 4198.30] and there
[4198.30 → 4198.54] will be
[4198.54 → 4198.98] glory
[4198.98 → 4200.24] in the
[4200.24 → 4200.60] crown
[4200.60 → 4202.60] fill your
[4202.60 → 4203.14] eyes
[4203.14 → 4204.62] with God's
[4204.62 → 4205.40] glory
[4205.40 → 4206.58] as we
[4206.58 → 4206.96] go
[4206.96 → 4207.82] today
[4207.82 → 4208.66] amen
[4208.66 → 4210.30] amen
[4210.30 → 4211.00] let's pray
[4211.00 → 4211.38] together
[4211.38 → 4216.88] lord our
[4216.88 → 4217.06] god
[4217.06 → 4218.20] fill us
[4218.20 → 4218.68] to
[4218.68 → 4219.68] overflowing
[4219.68 → 4220.60] with your
[4220.60 → 4221.02] love
[4221.02 → 4222.86] fill us
[4222.86 → 4223.28] to
[4223.28 → 4223.98] overflow
[4223.98 → 4224.36] in
[4224.36 → 4225.22] with your
[4225.22 → 4225.98] majesty
[4225.98 → 4226.86] with an
[4226.86 → 4227.34] experience
[4227.34 → 4228.18] of your
[4228.18 → 4228.76] glory
[4228.76 → 4229.22] so that
[4229.22 → 4229.48] we
[4229.48 → 4230.26] with
[4230.26 → 4231.08] unveiled
[4231.08 → 4231.58] faces
[4231.58 → 4231.96] can
[4231.96 → 4232.60] radiate
[4232.60 → 4233.12] the image
[4233.12 → 4233.50] of Jesus
[4233.50 → 4233.98] Christ
[4233.98 → 4234.86] to the
[4234.86 → 4235.18] world
[4235.18 → 4237.96] send us
[4237.96 → 4238.40] out
[4238.40 → 4239.48] in the
[4239.48 → 4239.78] glory
[4239.78 → 4240.08] of the
[4240.08 → 4240.56] cross
[4240.56 → 4241.34] and in
[4241.34 → 4241.72] the glory
[4241.72 → 4242.02] of the
[4242.02 → 4242.38] crown
[4242.38 → 4243.56] to be
[4243.56 → 4244.26] those
[4244.26 → 4245.16] declaring
[4245.16 → 4246.50] people
[4246.50 → 4247.82] in
[4247.82 → 4248.26] Christ
[4248.26 → 4248.88] Jesus
[4248.88 → 4249.84] we pray
[4249.84 → 4251.74] amen
[4251.74 → 4252.66] let's
[4252.66 → 4255.08] name
[4255.08 → 4257.42] to
[4258.08 → 4264.72] hear
[4264.72 → 4290.32] When I fear my faith will fail,
[4290.32 → 4294.76] Christ will hold me fast.
[4294.98 → 4298.68] When the tempter would prevail,
[4300.08 → 4303.40] He will hold me fast.
[4303.82 → 4308.20] I could never keep my hold
[4308.20 → 4312.16] through life's fearful path,
[4312.50 → 4316.92] for my love is soft and cold.
[4316.92 → 4321.32] He must hold me fast.
[4322.48 → 4326.92] He will hold me fast.
[4327.26 → 4330.78] He will hold me fast.
[4331.08 → 4335.10] For my Saviour loves me so.
[4335.86 → 4338.92] He will hold me fast.
[4338.92 → 4340.10] He will hold me fast.
[4349.10 → 4352.92] Those He saves are His delight,
[4354.22 → 4356.92] Christ will hold me fast.
[4356.92 → 4362.40] Precious in His holy sight,
[4362.48 → 4366.16] He will hold me fast.
[4366.70 → 4371.00] He'll not let my soul be lost.
[4371.24 → 4375.02] His promises shall last.
[4375.48 → 4379.82] Bought by Him at such a cost,
[4380.32 → 4383.92] He will hold me fast.
[4383.92 → 4388.92] He will hold me fast.
[4389.48 → 4392.92] He will hold me fast.
[4392.92 → 4397.96] For my Saviour loves me so.
[4398.66 → 4402.86] He will hold me fast.
[4402.86 → 4417.06] For my life He bled and died,
[4417.06 → 4421.02] Christ will hold me fast.
[4421.02 → 4424.74] Justice has been satisfied,
[4426.60 → 4429.80] He will hold me fast.
[4429.80 → 4435.06] Raised with Him to endless life.
[4435.06 → 4439.22] He will hold me fast.
[4439.22 → 4443.78] Till our faith is turned to sight,
[4444.12 → 4449.74] He will come at last.
[4449.74 → 4453.92] He will hold me fast.
[4453.92 → 4457.90] He will hold me fast.
[4457.90 → 4462.32] For my Saviour loves me so.
