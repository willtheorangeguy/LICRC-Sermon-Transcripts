[589.78 --> 590.34]  Good morning
[590.34 --> 591.94]  I've got an announcement
[591.94 --> 593.46]  Regarding the Abbotsford
[593.46 --> 595.28]  Flood response
[595.28 --> 597.76]  I know over the last two weeks
[597.76 --> 599.64]  We've all been wondering
[599.64 --> 600.56]  What can we do
[600.56 --> 602.12]  What can we do
[602.12 --> 603.02]  In a meaningful way
[603.02 --> 603.58]  Thank you
[603.58 --> 606.22]  To help out the people
[606.22 --> 608.72]  In the Abbotsford flood zone
[608.72 --> 611.78]  Gateway Christian Reformed Church
[611.78 --> 614.48]  Have organized a flood response
[614.48 --> 616.30]  In partnership with
[616.30 --> 618.36]  Christian Stewardship Services
[618.36 --> 621.60]  On the Gateway CRC website
[621.60 --> 624.18]  They have a flood response section
[624.18 --> 626.30]  Where they have a donation list
[626.30 --> 629.62]  Of items that are required
[629.62 --> 630.60]  For the victims
[630.60 --> 632.78]  And that are urgently needed
[632.78 --> 634.60]  They are storing
[634.60 --> 636.62]  And distributing these items
[636.62 --> 638.30]  As they come in
[638.30 --> 640.22]  At the church
[640.22 --> 641.96]  As deacons
[641.96 --> 643.66]  We decided that our congregation
[643.66 --> 645.98]  Would willingly help
[645.98 --> 647.12]  By donating items
[647.12 --> 647.96]  From the list
[647.96 --> 651.30]  And these little lists
[651.30 --> 652.82]  Have been distributed
[652.82 --> 654.00]  With the bulletin

[666.04 --> 667.72]  Or on Sunday mornings
[667.72 --> 670.20]  The church will be closed

[692.12 --> 695.12]  Please contact the deacons
[695.12 --> 696.98]  If you have donation items
[696.98 --> 698.04]  That need to be picked up
[698.04 --> 699.10]  From your residence

[725.50 --> 726.44]  For God's mercy
[726.44 --> 727.58]  And comfort
[727.58 --> 728.32]  To those
[728.32 --> 729.08]  Who have been
[729.08 --> 730.16]  Affected by the flooding
[730.16 --> 731.56]  And that he will
[731.56 --> 732.44]  Provide blessings
[732.44 --> 732.96]  To them
[732.96 --> 734.34]  In the long term solution
[734.34 --> 735.38]  Thank you
[735.38 --> 743.66]  So as Emo said
[743.66 --> 744.24]  There's a card

[757.46 --> 759.34]  With his greeting
[759.34 --> 765.42]  We gather together

[786.02 --> 786.82]  It is the season
[786.82 --> 787.50]  Of Advent
[787.50 --> 788.46]  And so we
[788.46 --> 789.36]  Each week
[789.36 --> 790.20]  We'll mark that
[790.20 --> 790.84]  Progression
[790.84 --> 791.78]  And anticipation
[791.78 --> 793.50]  By lighting candles
[793.50 --> 794.44]  In our worship
[794.44 --> 796.10]  And with an Advent liturgy
[796.10 --> 796.86]  And as Steve
[796.86 --> 797.28]  And Linda
[797.28 --> 798.36]  Are making their way up
[798.36 --> 799.76]  We're going to

[831.00 --> 831.52]  For you
[831.52 --> 832.80]  Do not let us
[832.80 --> 833.80]  Be put to shame
[833.80 --> 836.10]  While we wait
[836.10 --> 836.54]  For you
[836.54 --> 837.84]  Do not remember

[900.22 --> 901.32]  For the days
[901.32 --> 902.74]  When all will be made right
[902.74 --> 903.82]  In our relationships
[903.82 --> 904.60]  With you
[904.60 --> 905.68]  One another
[905.68 --> 907.26]  And your creation
[907.26 --> 910.32]  As we wait for those days
[910.32 --> 911.28]  Give us eyes
[911.28 --> 912.52]  To see your faithfulness
[912.52 --> 913.52]  And ears to hear
[913.52 --> 914.20]  Of your goodness
[914.20 --> 915.54]  So that our hearts
[915.54 --> 916.26]  May be humbled

[950.80 --> 962.88]  O come, Emmanuel
[962.88 --> 967.28]  Let that son captive
[967.28 --> 977.28]  If it's well, the thorns in all the exile
[977.28 --> 985.28]  Until the Son of God are near
[985.28 --> 994.28]  Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
[994.28 --> 1001.28]  Shall come to thee, O Israel
[1001.28 --> 1012.28]  O come, thou hast of God on high
[1012.28 --> 1019.28]  Who ordered all things I tell thee
[1019.28 --> 1026.28]  To us not have the promise shown
[1026.28 --> 1033.28]  And teach us in its ways to go
[1033.28 --> 1042.28]  Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
[1042.28 --> 1049.28]  Shall come to thee, O Israel
[1049.28 --> 1058.28]  O come, thou branch of justice
[1058.28 --> 1060.28]  And let us be stand
[1060.28 --> 1067.28]  Unto thine own and rescue them
[1067.28 --> 1075.28]  From depths of hell your people save
[1075.28 --> 1082.28]  And give the victory on the grave
[1082.28 --> 1090.28]  Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
[1090.28 --> 1097.28]  Shall come to thee, O Israel
[1097.28 --> 1102.28]  O Israel
[1102.28 --> 1107.28]  O come, thou hast of nations
[1107.28 --> 1114.28]  O ye worlds in one heart and now
[1114.28 --> 1119.28]  In all the sanctification seas
[1119.28 --> 1121.28]  And give the victory on the grave
[1121.28 --> 1123.28]  O God, thou hast of nations
[1123.28 --> 1124.28]  And give the victory on the grave
[1124.28 --> 1126.28]  And give the victory on the grave
[1126.28 --> 1128.28]  And give the victory on the grave
[1128.28 --> 1130.28]  Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
[1130.28 --> 1140.28]  Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
[1140.28 --> 1145.28]  Shall come to thee, O Israel
[1145.28 --> 1151.28]  O promised Christ
[1151.28 --> 1154.28]  O promised Christ
[1154.28 --> 1157.28]  We are a world at war
[1157.28 --> 1160.28]  Our peace depends on your coming
[1160.28 --> 1162.28]  We are a sinful people
[1162.28 --> 1165.28]  Our pardon depends on your coming
[1165.28 --> 1167.28]  We are full of good intentions
[1167.28 --> 1170.28]  But weak at keeping promises
[1170.28 --> 1172.28]  Our only hope of doing God's will
[1172.28 --> 1176.28]  Is that you should come and help us do it
[1176.28 --> 1179.28]  Lord Christ, word made flesh
[1179.28 --> 1181.28]  Our world waits
[1181.28 --> 1182.28]  For your peace
[1182.28 --> 1183.28]  For your pardon
[1183.28 --> 1184.28]  And for your grace
[1184.28 --> 1188.28]  O come, O come, Lord Jesus
[1188.28 --> 1189.28]  Amen
[1209.28 --> 1222.28]  Still, my soul be still
[1222.28 --> 1226.28]  And do not fear
[1226.28 --> 1230.28]  The winds of change may rage tomorrow
[1230.28 --> 1236.28]  God is not your son
[1236.28 --> 1238.28]  No longer tread
[1238.28 --> 1243.28]  The fires of unexpected sorrow
[1243.28 --> 1249.28]  God, you are my God
[1249.28 --> 1252.28]  And I will trust in you
[1252.28 --> 1257.28]  And God be shaken
[1257.28 --> 1262.28]  Lord, the peace we will
[1262.28 --> 1264.28]  For your steadfast spirit
[1264.28 --> 1266.28]  And in me
[1266.28 --> 1272.28]  To rest in you alone
[1272.28 --> 1278.28]  Still, my soul be still
[1278.28 --> 1281.28]  You will my soul be still
[1281.28 --> 1285.28]  You will not be through
[1285.28 --> 1288.28]  My master, my sanctification
[1288.28 --> 1295.28]  All unto its praise
[1295.28 --> 1298.28]  With shield of faith
[1298.28 --> 1301.28]  Against temptation's pain
[1301.28 --> 1302.28]  And in me
[1302.28 --> 1304.28]  And in me
[1304.28 --> 1305.28]  And in me
[1305.28 --> 1308.28]  Lord, you are my God
[1308.28 --> 1310.28]  And I will trust in you
[1310.28 --> 1312.28]  And God be shaken
[1312.28 --> 1314.28]  Lord, the peace renew
[1314.28 --> 1316.28]  And I will trust in you
[1316.28 --> 1319.28]  Amen
[1319.28 --> 1321.28]  Come, the peace renew
[1321.28 --> 1323.28]  I'll send my spirit
[1323.28 --> 1325.28]  And in me
[1325.28 --> 1327.28]  To rest in you alone
[1327.28 --> 1329.28]  Still, my soul be still
[1329.28 --> 1342.12]  Still, my soul, be still
[1342.12 --> 1349.94]  Do not forsake the truth you learned in the beginning
[1349.94 --> 1359.12]  Wait upon the Lord and hope will rise
[1359.12 --> 1363.66]  As stars appear, the prayers are living
[1363.66 --> 1369.34]  Lord, you are my God
[1369.34 --> 1375.92]  And I will trust in you and I'll be shaken
[1375.92 --> 1382.40]  Lord, I'll peace with you
[1382.40 --> 1390.42]  As you must be with me to rest in you
[1390.42 --> 1395.66]  Lord, you are my love
[1395.66 --> 1402.36]  And I will trust in you and love me shaken
[1402.36 --> 1408.84]  Lord, I'll peace with you
[1408.84 --> 1418.84]  As you must be with me to rest in you alone
[1418.84 --> 1425.32]  Lord, I'll peace with you
[1425.32 --> 1449.42]  All the poor are powerless
[1449.42 --> 1455.90]  And all the lost and lonely
[1455.90 --> 1462.96]  And all the thieves will come to death
[1462.96 --> 1467.90]  And know that you are holy
[1467.90 --> 1474.38]  And know that you are holy
[1474.38 --> 1483.72]  And all we'll sing out hallelujah
[1483.72 --> 1490.38]  And we will cry out hallelujah
[1490.38 --> 1498.28]  All the lost and more content
[1498.28 --> 1505.86]  And all who feel unworthy
[1505.86 --> 1511.86]  And all who hurt your loving man
[1511.86 --> 1513.86]  unworthy
[1513.86 --> 1517.82]  and all who
[1517.82 --> 1519.20]  hurt and love
[1519.20 --> 1523.44]  will know
[1523.44 --> 1525.86]  that you are holy
[1525.86 --> 1530.02]  and all
[1530.02 --> 1531.80]  will sing
[1531.80 --> 1533.86]  hallelujah
[1533.86 --> 1537.62]  and we will
[1537.62 --> 1538.60]  cry
[1538.60 --> 1539.86]  hallelujah
[1541.86 --> 1544.22]  and all who
[1544.22 --> 1545.42]  sing
[1545.42 --> 1547.86]  hallelujah
[1548.92 --> 1549.86]  and we
[1549.86 --> 1551.86]  will cry
[1552.30 --> 1553.86]  hallelujah
[1556.32 --> 1559.86]  hallelujah
[1559.86 --> 1563.86]  hallelujah
[1563.86 --> 1567.86]  hallelujah
[1567.86 --> 1569.86]  hallelujah
[1569.86 --> 1580.74]  Shout it, go on and scream it from the mountains
[1580.74 --> 1588.74]  Go on and tell it to the masses
[1588.74 --> 1596.74]  That He is God
[1596.74 --> 1606.34]  Shout it, go on and scream it from the mountains
[1606.34 --> 1613.10]  Go on and tell it to the masses
[1613.10 --> 1619.62]  That He is God
[1619.62 --> 1626.72]  Shout it, go on and scream it from the mountains
[1626.72 --> 1633.20]  Go on and scream it from the mountains
[1633.20 --> 1639.84]  Go on and tell it to the masses
[1639.84 --> 1646.32]  That He is God
[1646.32 --> 1656.80]  We will sing a hallelujah
[1656.80 --> 1663.80]  We will cry a hallelujah
[1663.80 --> 1670.28]  We will sing a hallelujah
[1670.28 --> 1686.76]  Shout it, go on and scream it from the mountains
[1686.76 --> 1693.24]  Go on and tell it to the masses
[1693.24 --> 1699.72]  That He is God
[1699.72 --> 1713.72]  Shout it, go on and scream it from the mountains
[1713.72 --> 1720.20]  Go on and tell it to the masses
[1720.20 --> 1726.20]  That He is God
[1726.20 --> 1736.68]  We invite you to be seated
[1736.68 --> 1747.16]  Thank you
[1747.16 --> 1770.18]  Good morning
[1770.18 --> 1774.66]  Today's offerings are for our church budget
[1774.66 --> 1777.72]  And Cascade Christian Counseling
[1777.72 --> 1783.96]  Which is a non-profit organization that has been in operation for over 35 years
[1783.96 --> 1790.04]  They offer a caring faith-based approach to helping people move towards healing
[1790.04 --> 1796.80]  The funds raised help to provide lower session fees to those who can't afford to get the help they need
[1796.80 --> 1800.68]  You may also give a donation to the Abbotsford Flood Response
[1800.68 --> 1805.98]  Just remember all donations will go to Cascade Christian Counseling unless otherwise noted
[1805.98 --> 1806.68]  Thank you
[1806.68 --> 1820.40]  Next week we're having a collection for the Refugee Sponsorship Fund
[1820.40 --> 1822.40]  And you're probably wondering
[1822.40 --> 1826.64]  There's certainly a lot to give to these days
[1826.64 --> 1829.28]  But I just want to highlight it for a moment
[1829.28 --> 1832.18]  So you will also note in the bulletin
[1832.18 --> 1837.98]  That the family that we had planned on sponsoring
[1837.98 --> 1840.10]  Was able to get out of Sudan
[1840.10 --> 1842.96]  And so we will no longer be following that up
[1842.96 --> 1846.96]  But we have our plans on sponsoring another family
[1846.96 --> 1851.24]  And one of the requirements now that the government has put on
[1851.24 --> 1854.30]  Is that we need to have money in the bank
[1854.30 --> 1858.12]  Before and they want to see it there before we can do the sponsorship
[1858.12 --> 1861.24]  Which means we need to at some point build up $30,000
[1861.24 --> 1864.36]  Now we have about $2,000 in the fund
[1864.36 --> 1868.36]  And but so as you're thinking ahead to next week
[1868.36 --> 1870.82]  Please keep that in mind as well
[1870.82 --> 1874.66]  Because we do want to continue with this ministry
[1874.66 --> 1879.22]  And this congregation has been very very supportive of this initiative in the past
[1879.22 --> 1882.64]  And so anyway I just want to highlight it
[1882.64 --> 1886.46]  And next week I'll be up here again to give a little bit more information
[1886.46 --> 1890.46]  So keep that in your mind too as you're thinking ahead to the end of the year
[1890.46 --> 1891.70]  The church has a budget
[1891.70 --> 1893.78]  We've done some upgrading
[1893.78 --> 1895.36]  There's the floods
[1895.36 --> 1897.50]  I know it just seems endless
[1897.50 --> 1900.02]  But please keep that in your in your minds
[1900.02 --> 1901.30]  And in your thoughts and in prayers
[1901.30 --> 1903.84]  And give what God lays upon your heart to give
[1903.84 --> 1904.30]  Thank you
[1904.30 --> 1934.28]  Thank you.
[1934.30 --> 1964.28]  Thank you.
[1964.30 --> 1971.30]  God by every word
[1971.30 --> 1979.30]  That no seeds come the mouth of God
[1979.98 --> 1986.30]  Allelu, Alleluia
[1986.30 --> 1988.30]  Now
[1988.30 --> 1996.30]  As and it shall be given unto you
[1996.30 --> 2002.30]  Secretly shall come
[2002.30 --> 2012.30]  Now and the door shall be opened to you
[2012.30 --> 2019.30]  Allelu, Alleluia
[2019.30 --> 2029.30]  Alleluia
[2029.30 --> 2036.30]  Alleluia
[2036.30 --> 2044.30]  Alleluia
[2044.30 --> 2052.30]  Allelu, Alleluia
[2052.30 --> 2054.30]  Alleluia
[2054.30 --> 2056.30]  Alleluia
[2056.30 --> 2068.30]  Alleluia
[2068.30 --> 2074.30]  Alright kids, I'm gonna invite you to come right up here today because my chair is gone, I see
[2074.30 --> 2081.44]  So I'm going to sit here, and if you're any age, but particularly age 3 up to grade 4, come on up.
[2094.52 --> 2095.18]  All right.
[2096.14 --> 2099.46]  So you guys know that every month that we have a memory verse,
[2099.78 --> 2103.96]  and at the end of the month, if you recite the memory verse, then you get a prize.
[2103.96 --> 2111.62]  But I think you have an extra week this month because Mrs. Karis and Mrs. Amy both are not here to give you the prize.
[2112.02 --> 2114.10]  So we're going to practice it one more time up here.
[2114.62 --> 2119.20]  And then I think next week, if you know the memory verse, then she'll be around to do that.
[2119.34 --> 2124.52]  So, and for the whole church, if you guys can join in, we'd like everyone to be involved, right?
[2125.98 --> 2126.34]  Okay.
[2126.48 --> 2131.18]  So I'm just going to do, some of you guys might know this already, but I'll just read one line,
[2131.18 --> 2132.82]  and then you guys repeat it back to me.
[2132.82 --> 2135.68]  And then I'll read the next line, and then you repeat it, and we'll do it that way.
[2135.96 --> 2136.16]  Okay.
[2136.28 --> 2139.90]  So everyone here, I invite everyone here to join in.
[2140.04 --> 2141.42]  So this is from Proverbs 3.
[2141.42 --> 2142.42]  Proverbs 3.
[2142.42 --> 2144.76]  Trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[2148.10 --> 2150.82]  And lean not on your own understanding.
[2154.52 --> 2156.90]  In all your ways, acknowledge him.
[2160.20 --> 2162.58]  And he will make your path straight.
[2165.70 --> 2168.00]  Proverbs 3, verse 5 to 6.
[2168.00 --> 2168.56]  Proverbs 3.
[2171.42 --> 2172.56]  Excellent job.
[2172.56 --> 2176.56]  So just a reminder, you can always grab one of these from the sign-in booth over there.
[2177.24 --> 2181.64]  Now, before we go to children's worship time, I have something to tell you.
[2181.72 --> 2184.82]  But before, I would like you guys all to stand up for these instructions.
[2185.32 --> 2188.28]  Normally, we sit down in Kids' Corner, but today I thought we're going to stand up.
[2188.68 --> 2194.14]  And I would like you guys to put one of your hands on your head and a finger on your nose.
[2194.14 --> 2196.70]  And now I want you to jump in circles.
[2197.04 --> 2197.18]  Okay.
[2198.38 --> 2201.16]  I think it makes more sense if we do Kids' Corner like this.
[2201.82 --> 2202.46]  Do you guys agree?
[2202.56 --> 2204.72]  I think it makes more sense.
[2206.30 --> 2206.62]  Okay.
[2206.72 --> 2207.28]  Stop, stop, stop.
[2207.36 --> 2207.74]  You don't think?
[2207.82 --> 2207.96]  Okay.
[2207.98 --> 2209.34]  I'll give you something different instead.
[2209.56 --> 2217.66]  So instead of doing that, I'd like you to reach your hands as high as you can and then touch the ground with your hands.
[2217.66 --> 2220.46]  Well, like up and down like this.
[2220.72 --> 2221.18]  Like that.
[2221.38 --> 2222.92]  And do that as fast as you can.
[2223.54 --> 2225.52]  Well, we could do Kids' Corner like that instead.
[2225.68 --> 2227.08]  That could make sense.
[2230.72 --> 2231.46]  It's a little bit.
[2231.58 --> 2233.00]  Well, I could make everyone do that.
[2233.06 --> 2234.82]  Should I make everyone do that next time?
[2235.48 --> 2235.84]  No?
[2236.72 --> 2237.56]  I could do that.
[2237.60 --> 2238.72]  So you guys can sit down.
[2239.20 --> 2243.42]  I wanted to do that just for a little example because today in children's worship time,
[2243.42 --> 2248.90]  we are going to read a story where a group of people called the Israelites, we all know about those guys,
[2249.26 --> 2253.12]  they were given some instructions and they didn't really make a lot of sense to them.
[2253.22 --> 2255.14]  It wasn't the normal way to do things.
[2255.48 --> 2261.44]  So here we normally sit down and you get to listen to one of us talk to you or something like that.
[2261.88 --> 2263.22]  We don't usually jump around in circles.
[2263.30 --> 2265.64]  But if I tell you to do that, you guys all did it.
[2266.12 --> 2266.38]  Right?
[2266.54 --> 2267.52]  Well, most of you did it.
[2267.64 --> 2270.78]  So that was really good following instructions even though it didn't make a lot of sense.
[2270.78 --> 2273.38]  So we're going to learn about how the Israelites had to do that.
[2273.42 --> 2276.90]  And how God's instructions ended up making sense in the end.
[2277.84 --> 2281.32]  So now I'm going to get you to stand up again because for the blessing we always stand up.
[2281.38 --> 2282.68]  So everyone can stand up.
[2282.84 --> 2284.54]  And we're going to face this way, kids.
[2287.64 --> 2288.12]  All right.
[2288.16 --> 2288.54]  Are you ready?
[2290.04 --> 2291.72]  The Lord is ready.
[2303.42 --> 2303.86]  The Lord is ready.
[2303.90 --> 2304.90]  The Lord is breathe.
[2304.90 --> 2305.00]  By the cheek.
[2305.24 --> 2305.82]  God's erstmal wife.
[2305.96 --> 2306.20]  By the way.
[2306.42 --> 2306.46]  The Lord is ready.
[2309.36 --> 2310.38]  The Lord is ready.
[2310.38 --> 2312.12]  Because our Lord is doing this to all things.
[2312.62 --> 2314.22]  I have been ready.
[2314.28 --> 2314.90]  We're ready to pray.
[2315.00 --> 2316.34]  Because our Lord is ready.
[2316.38 --> 2318.24]  And when we can still stand up.
[2318.36 --> 2319.40]  I have done is� a littleience.
[2319.54 --> 2321.64]  I love the buffs and we are ready for that.
[2321.82 --> 2322.80]  We have to come.
[2322.82 --> 2323.74]  And if he does that, we're ready for everything.
[2323.76 --> 2325.42]  And everyone can actually respond to me and he's gonna make it awesome try like that.
[2325.78 --> 2327.76]  So doing the遣 زers of that lift is where I am a normal force.
[2327.96 --> 2329.74]  And they love him to focus onoded now.
[2329.74 --> 2344.68]  Good morning.
[2353.26 --> 2358.50]  It's great to hear that our memory verse for this month is also our wedding text.
[2358.50 --> 2367.04]  You would think that would make it easier for me to remember, but due to old age, you
[2367.04 --> 2369.14]  get forgetful sometimes, but it is great.
[2369.26 --> 2369.62]  Thank you.
[2371.32 --> 2377.04]  My name is John, and I'm one of the elders here, and I want to lead you in prayer this
[2377.04 --> 2377.34]  morning.
[2379.20 --> 2384.70]  The list in our bulletin is long for the things that we are asked to keep in prayer.
[2384.70 --> 2392.66]  One of the items that is not listed there, I want to just let you know that Peter DeFries'
[2392.66 --> 2398.60]  brother Clarence, who had lived in California, has passed away this past week.
[2398.60 --> 2402.48]  He was 87 years old, and he died of cancer.
[2404.44 --> 2409.30]  And we are asked to, not asked, but we would also like to keep his family, and also the
[2409.30 --> 2415.22]  family at large in prayer, and the family is scattered throughout the continent, east coast
[2415.22 --> 2418.88]  in Canada, west coast here, and also in the States.
[2419.36 --> 2424.48]  So we'd like to keep the DeFries' in our prayers this coming week also.
[2424.48 --> 2427.04]  Shall we come to the Lord in prayer?
[2432.70 --> 2435.86]  Heavenly Father, we bow our heads before you this morning.
[2439.64 --> 2442.38]  Lord, it is great to be here.
[2445.34 --> 2447.82]  Lord, the week sometimes is hard.
[2447.82 --> 2455.94]  Lord, as Lord, we struggle through so many things these days, and yet we come here, we
[2455.94 --> 2462.74]  pray with glad hearts, and some come, Lord, struggling also, and that we may come here to rejoice and
[2462.74 --> 2464.14]  to worship you.
[2464.66 --> 2467.16]  That we may do so in word and in song.
[2468.96 --> 2472.22]  That we may do so, Lord, in spirit and in truth.
[2472.22 --> 2490.02]  Lord, we sang this morning also, and we pray, Lord, that we may shout out your name, and that others may hear of you, may know of you, and Lord, and come to accept you.
[2490.50 --> 2493.50]  Lord, we pray that you would use even us.
[2493.50 --> 2497.50]  And Lord, we...
[2497.50 --> 2506.42]  As much as, Lord, we have prayed that, still, Lord, we know that each of us struggles, and
[2506.42 --> 2510.78]  we struggle in so many ways, and we fall short.
[2510.94 --> 2513.54]  We pray, Lord, forgive us where we have wronged.
[2514.48 --> 2519.52]  We pray, Lord, that each day again, each moment of our lives, that your spirit would work in
[2519.52 --> 2522.20]  our hearts to lead us and guide us in all that we do.
[2523.50 --> 2531.14]  And Lord, through this week also, again, Lord, the rains continued.
[2532.92 --> 2535.90]  We have also experienced beautiful sunny days.
[2539.88 --> 2544.34]  And yet, Lord, there are still many who struggle through the floods, and as waters recede in
[2544.34 --> 2546.88]  areas, waters increase in other areas.
[2546.88 --> 2548.88]  Lord, we...
[2548.88 --> 2550.88]  Lord, we...
[2550.88 --> 2552.76]  We have many...
[2552.76 --> 2557.56]  Many of us have friends, but also family members who are struggling through this crisis.
[2559.80 --> 2560.88]  Lord, we...
[2561.44 --> 2568.60]  Many of us also wonder, how may we help, and what is the best way to work through this?
[2568.60 --> 2571.58]  And we pray, Lord, that you would open our eyes to that.
[2574.06 --> 2579.34]  And Lord, as our hearts open up, may we give in the many different ways that are possible.
[2579.70 --> 2583.36]  Our time, our funds, of goods, Lord.
[2583.46 --> 2587.14]  We pray that you would lead us and guide us through this.
[2588.44 --> 2594.02]  There are many, Lord, who still struggle through the COVID pandemic as well.
[2594.02 --> 2599.70]  And Lord, as new variants show up, and for many, Lord, that too is a worry.
[2601.16 --> 2606.90]  May we here too, Lord, lean on you for understanding, for guidance, for strength.
[2610.10 --> 2612.40]  And Lord, there are many who work through these things also.
[2612.58 --> 2615.36]  And we pray for doctors and other frontline workers.
[2615.36 --> 2623.06]  Lord, as they continue to struggle also with the stress that is put on them,
[2623.14 --> 2627.70]  that they too would be given courage through you, Lord, that they may continue to do their work.
[2630.18 --> 2631.36]  Lord, we...
[2631.92 --> 2634.36]  Thank you this morning also that...
[2635.50 --> 2638.02]  Pastor Dan and Dana may be here in our midst.
[2638.24 --> 2639.86]  Lord, we thank you for them.
[2640.00 --> 2641.36]  We pray, Lord, that...
[2641.36 --> 2646.54]  In his work on the East Coast also, that you would bless them there.
[2647.28 --> 2650.66]  We pray, Lord, that this weekend may be a blessing for them here also.
[2651.46 --> 2652.36]  Lord, we...
[2654.36 --> 2658.24]  Pray for the many who grieve at this time also.
[2658.44 --> 2660.20]  We pray for the Varshtras.
[2660.32 --> 2661.70]  We pray for the Miles family.
[2661.94 --> 2663.32]  We pray for the DeFreeses.
[2666.26 --> 2667.36]  Lord, we...
[2668.36 --> 2670.00]  Pray for Renita and the family also.
[2670.00 --> 2672.00]  As later today, they...
[2673.00 --> 2676.00]  Have a service in where we may remember Dave and...
[2677.26 --> 2679.00]  Lord, the gift that he was...
[2680.00 --> 2682.36]  To us also and to his family.
[2684.42 --> 2686.00]  And Lord, through these times...
[2687.64 --> 2690.00]  Many of us will also recall...
[2690.58 --> 2692.20]  Deaths within our own families.
[2694.52 --> 2697.00]  Lord, these memories come back...
[2697.64 --> 2699.00]  And they too hurt...
[2700.00 --> 2703.00]  We pray, Lord, for each of us...
[2703.00 --> 2704.34]  That you would give us strength.
[2705.42 --> 2708.58]  Give us comfort and courage to face these times.
[2712.36 --> 2713.00]  Lord, we...
[2715.00 --> 2716.48]  Pray for Elsa Hubert.
[2716.58 --> 2717.00]  Says she...
[2718.00 --> 2719.26]  Had a fall this week.
[2719.38 --> 2722.00]  We pray, Lord, that the surgery she went through on Friday also...
[2722.00 --> 2725.00]  Would give her good healing.
[2725.00 --> 2730.30]  That she too may return to her normal activities soon.
[2732.00 --> 2733.00]  Lord, we...
[2737.00 --> 2738.00]  Pray for our...
[2739.00 --> 2742.38]  Refugee sponsorship committee as well.
[2742.38 --> 2743.38]  And that, Lord, there too...
[2743.38 --> 2746.38]  And even though we have so many areas to give...
[2747.38 --> 2747.88]  And...
[2747.88 --> 2749.12]  Lord, we...
[2749.12 --> 2751.70]  We feel tugged perhaps in different ways.
[2751.76 --> 2755.38]  And we pray for your spirit to lead us and guide us to...
[2756.46 --> 2759.26]  In the many ways, Lord, that we are able to give.
[2759.32 --> 2761.54]  And we pray that that too would go well.
[2761.54 --> 2764.54]  Lord, we...
[2764.54 --> 2772.30]  Thank you for the training that we as elders could have this past week.
[2772.38 --> 2773.64]  A time of getting together.
[2774.46 --> 2776.48]  A time where we could share a meal.
[2776.76 --> 2780.20]  A time where we could share thoughts about our work.
[2780.20 --> 2785.20]  And to be guided, Lord, as to how you would want us...
[2785.98 --> 2788.96]  To lead this congregation in its spiritual formation.
[2790.80 --> 2791.78]  And, Lord, we...
[2791.78 --> 2792.50]  Many of...
[2792.50 --> 2794.58]  We each, Lord, feel we fall short.
[2794.68 --> 2796.20]  And we pray that you would...
[2797.66 --> 2800.40]  Give us the gifts that we require, Lord.
[2801.74 --> 2805.14]  So that together as a church we may grow in you.
[2806.38 --> 2809.64]  Lord, we pray for leaders in other areas also.
[2809.64 --> 2813.64]  When governments, both at a local, provincial, and federal level...
[2814.16 --> 2817.18]  May each, Lord, seek you in their...
[2817.18 --> 2822.34]  In guidance as they do their work in leading the various areas that you have called them to.
[2825.74 --> 2826.64]  Lord, we...
[2829.16 --> 2832.64]  Pray that as we continue to worship you now...
[2832.64 --> 2836.48]  That, Lord, may we experience the presence of your spirit.
[2836.48 --> 2840.68]  We pray for Pastor Kevin as he leads us through your word.
[2841.34 --> 2842.68]  Give him the words to speak.
[2842.86 --> 2844.62]  Give us open hearts to listen.
[2845.70 --> 2847.58]  And together, Lord, may we honor you.
[2848.00 --> 2849.48]  We pray this in your name.
[2849.86 --> 2850.12]  Amen.
[2866.48 --> 2877.12]  I think it is.
[2878.16 --> 2878.42]  Yeah.
[2878.60 --> 2879.06]  There we go.
[2879.40 --> 2881.74]  I'm always hesitant the first words to come out of my mouth.
[2881.86 --> 2884.04]  Because sometimes they're way louder than I want them to be.
[2884.16 --> 2886.04]  But, Courtney, you're on top of it as always.
[2886.12 --> 2886.46]  Well done.
[2886.82 --> 2887.38]  You know what?
[2887.44 --> 2888.80]  Actually, I haven't done this in a while.
[2889.06 --> 2891.42]  There are two of the most thankless jobs in the church.
[2891.42 --> 2894.64]  And that is our sound person and our media person.
[2894.72 --> 2898.34]  Because when things go right, no one pays attention to them.
[2898.60 --> 2902.10]  But when things go wrong, everyone thinks it's their fault.
[2902.26 --> 2903.76]  And very rarely is it.
[2904.12 --> 2905.84]  So I think we should just give them a big clap.
[2905.96 --> 2907.12]  Because they do good work.
[2909.60 --> 2910.04]  So.
[2911.26 --> 2913.38]  Thank you all, Inika and Courtney, today.
[2913.50 --> 2915.90]  And everyone else who serves every other week as well.
[2915.90 --> 2915.94]  So.
[2916.94 --> 2920.88]  We love to romanticize things in our culture.
[2921.10 --> 2924.30]  We idealize things very often.
[2924.46 --> 2928.66]  We like to look at things and make them seem better than they actually are.
[2929.04 --> 2931.82]  And we do this with almost everything.
[2932.58 --> 2934.34]  We do it for time, for example.
[2934.36 --> 2935.16]  We do it with time.
[2935.22 --> 2936.84]  We like to look back at the past and we think,
[2936.84 --> 2938.72]  Oh, remember the good old days?
[2939.08 --> 2942.24]  Back when bread was a nickel and we didn't have these TikTokers everywhere.
[2942.72 --> 2944.32]  And everybody worked with their hands.
[2944.32 --> 2949.64]  I wish we lived in the 1400s when life was simple and we could grow our own food.
[2950.00 --> 2951.60]  And we didn't have a care in the world.
[2952.50 --> 2955.06]  Of course, in reality, wars were constantly breaking out.
[2955.24 --> 2956.30]  Deodorant wasn't a thing.
[2956.40 --> 2959.22]  And septicemia was lurking right around the corner, wherever you looked.
[2960.82 --> 2962.42]  Or we look to the future, right?
[2962.46 --> 2963.10]  We look to the future.
[2963.18 --> 2965.16]  We say, I can't wait till I'm done with this assignment.
[2965.16 --> 2967.12]  I can't wait till I've graduated high school.
[2967.22 --> 2968.22]  Or I've finished my degree.
[2968.46 --> 2969.70]  Or I get my first job.
[2969.76 --> 2970.90]  Or I own my first house.
[2971.02 --> 2972.32]  Or my kids are all grown up.
[2972.34 --> 2973.64]  Or I get that job promotion.
[2973.64 --> 2974.90]  Or I get that surgery.
[2974.96 --> 2975.70]  Or when I'm retired.
[2975.86 --> 2979.52]  And we list a lot of things that we just have to get to this.
[2979.62 --> 2982.82]  Because if we can get to this, then it's going to be better.
[2984.16 --> 2984.36]  Right?
[2984.90 --> 2986.30]  Romanticizing the future helps.
[2986.82 --> 2992.26]  Even though we all know that life doesn't actually get easier as we progress along.
[2992.96 --> 2994.46]  We romanticize relationships.
[2994.46 --> 2995.56]  If I could only get a girlfriend.
[2995.72 --> 2996.34]  Or get a husband.
[2996.70 --> 2997.42]  Or have kids.
[2997.58 --> 2999.48]  Or maybe live on an island all by myself.
[2999.68 --> 3002.08]  If I could have any of those things, life would be better.
[3003.64 --> 3005.86]  Sadly, the flip of that is also true.
[3005.98 --> 3007.84]  We all know the statistics.
[3008.02 --> 3011.24]  There's many people who live who say, if I could only be severed from that relationship.
[3011.34 --> 3012.40]  If I could only have a divorce.
[3012.46 --> 3014.02]  If this relationship could only be over.
[3014.82 --> 3016.28]  Life would be better.
[3016.92 --> 3019.18]  We even romanticize the bad.
[3020.18 --> 3022.88]  We Christians do it with ministry and mission.
[3022.98 --> 3025.54]  If I could just go and help out in that homeless shelter.
[3025.62 --> 3028.18]  If I could do this thing, I'll really start to make a difference.
[3028.28 --> 3029.68]  I'll start to feel better.
[3030.14 --> 3031.74]  I'll save the day.
[3032.50 --> 3035.28]  And then you find yourself buttering buns in the back corner.
[3035.40 --> 3036.74]  And there's not a lot of face time.
[3036.80 --> 3038.58]  And you're not getting that glory you kind of wanted.
[3038.68 --> 3040.28]  And you actually realize maybe that's a little bit selfish.
[3041.38 --> 3044.24]  Or you serve in the same location for years and years on end.
[3044.28 --> 3047.30]  And you see the same people coming in each and every day.
[3047.30 --> 3048.68]  Their lives not changing.
[3049.18 --> 3050.72]  And you get downtrodden.
[3051.14 --> 3054.98]  It makes you feel hopeless because you realize you can't change people's situations.
[3055.24 --> 3057.08]  You realize it's hard.
[3057.90 --> 3058.80]  Ministry is tough.
[3059.82 --> 3061.52]  And yet we still romanticize.
[3063.14 --> 3068.42]  We romanticize people and habits, time, ministry, relationships, situations, everything.
[3069.80 --> 3073.12]  And if you're struggling to believe me, if you're struggling to believe any of those examples,
[3073.78 --> 3076.84]  perhaps you find yourself on Instagram or Facebook these days.
[3076.84 --> 3078.96]  And you're scrolling through posts and seeing your friends.
[3079.04 --> 3081.10]  And you're thinking, ah, if I just had that.
[3081.24 --> 3082.86]  If my life was a little bit like this.
[3083.00 --> 3085.20]  If I could just do those things that they're doing.
[3085.56 --> 3086.84]  My life would be better.
[3088.52 --> 3090.76]  I'm not going to ask you to raise your hands if you've done that.
[3090.82 --> 3095.14]  But statistically, the majority of us struggle with this regularly.
[3095.14 --> 3099.28]  We romanticize things all the time.
[3100.96 --> 3103.30]  And we do this with Christmas as well.
[3104.42 --> 3106.44]  There's going to be a picture up behind me right second here.
[3106.96 --> 3108.02]  Coming up on screen.
[3108.12 --> 3108.66]  There it is.
[3109.06 --> 3109.98]  Look at this picture.
[3110.62 --> 3111.28]  Isn't it beautiful?
[3112.60 --> 3114.74]  I mean, the sheep are all sitting so nice.
[3114.84 --> 3116.20]  The wise men look so dapper.
[3116.74 --> 3118.44]  Apparently, the angels found a dove nearby.
[3118.62 --> 3119.28]  So that's cool.
[3119.76 --> 3121.66]  They also found that olive branch from Noah's Ark.
[3121.74 --> 3122.28]  So good for them.
[3122.34 --> 3123.08]  That's lucky, I guess.
[3123.92 --> 3126.46]  Mary looks great, considering she just gave birth, right?
[3126.54 --> 3127.74]  The horse is bowing down.
[3127.80 --> 3128.22]  That's cute.
[3129.06 --> 3132.40]  And if Christmas movies have taught me anything, that cow standing right there,
[3132.80 --> 3138.62]  she is just about to break out in song and give the most beautiful rendition of Silent Night the world has ever heard.
[3138.62 --> 3139.88]  We will all be moved to tears.
[3140.58 --> 3142.30]  What a beautiful, beautiful scene.
[3143.98 --> 3148.92]  In reality, of course, that scene was way messier than that.
[3149.90 --> 3151.72]  The shepherds were super unruly.
[3152.28 --> 3159.02]  I'm not positive Joseph had access to medical gods, which in my experience is very important when your wife gives birth to a child.
[3159.46 --> 3162.76]  And honestly, I think it's unlikely that the cow sang anything.
[3163.82 --> 3166.26]  I think the cow would have just stood there and pooped a little bit.
[3167.48 --> 3170.84]  Actually, not to ruining a perfectly good nativity scene that you've got in your house,
[3170.90 --> 3172.38]  but there likely wasn't a cow there at all.
[3172.46 --> 3175.32]  Dairy farming wasn't really a thing that they did in the ancient Near East.
[3175.32 --> 3178.44]  And that donkey that we assume Mary rode in on, not in the Bible.
[3179.00 --> 3180.60]  We don't know if there was a donkey there or not.
[3181.92 --> 3183.96]  There may have been a goat, maybe a camel.
[3184.08 --> 3184.82]  That might make sense.
[3184.86 --> 3186.34]  But the shepherds bringing their sheep there?
[3186.42 --> 3186.96]  Probably not.
[3187.02 --> 3187.68]  They wouldn't have fit.
[3188.22 --> 3189.34]  Why would they take all their sheep?
[3190.94 --> 3193.90]  The point is, we romanticize the nativity scene.
[3193.98 --> 3195.42]  We want it to be picturesque.
[3195.44 --> 3195.96]  And that's okay.
[3196.60 --> 3198.90]  I'm not here to smack talk the nativity scene.
[3198.96 --> 3199.94]  Don't let me ruin Christmas.
[3199.94 --> 3203.90]  But that picture, that's the definition of romanticism.
[3205.52 --> 3208.68]  We do this for the nativity scene because we do this with Christmas.
[3209.46 --> 3212.70]  We want Christmas to be so nice, so beautiful, so unique.
[3212.82 --> 3219.24]  This marvel that we can celebrate in this season where we can just smile and look at everyone and burst out.
[3219.34 --> 3222.54]  It's the most wonderful time of the year.
[3222.56 --> 3223.44]  That's what we want.
[3224.22 --> 3229.68]  And the sermon series, though, is going to break down some of these false assumptions.
[3229.94 --> 3233.08]  We're going to be un-hallmarking Christmas, as it were.
[3233.28 --> 3235.12]  Now, we're not doing this to be Scrooges.
[3235.52 --> 3240.30]  The goal isn't to have us all leave here all downtrodden because our nice worldview of Christmas has shifted.
[3241.56 --> 3248.58]  But rather, we're going to do this because these false assumptions that we've built up over Christendom, over centuries, as it were,
[3249.38 --> 3254.48]  they take away from what Christmas is trying to accomplish.
[3254.60 --> 3257.62]  It takes away from the Christmas story.
[3257.62 --> 3262.28]  While it's good to be joyful, it's good to be cheerful, it's good to have the most wonderful time of the year,
[3263.02 --> 3264.66]  the Christmas story isn't clean.
[3265.70 --> 3269.62]  And as we sit in Advent, we want to sit in that mess.
[3269.80 --> 3273.28]  We don't want to try to push through it and get to Christmas because that's the day.
[3273.98 --> 3275.74]  We want to sit in that mess.
[3275.96 --> 3277.94]  Christmas was messy.
[3278.12 --> 3280.30]  Christmas is messy.
[3280.30 --> 3284.48]  So some of you may be very uncomfortable during this series.
[3285.48 --> 3289.02]  But the goal of this series is to understand what actually happened.
[3289.64 --> 3291.06]  Why was it so messy?
[3291.40 --> 3296.90]  And what myths do we need to debunk in order for us to fully grasp why Jesus came?
[3296.90 --> 3303.62]  Our goal is to understand why this event is so important.
[3304.64 --> 3307.08]  And so that's what we're going to do for the next four weeks.
[3307.16 --> 3310.18]  We are going to un-hallmark the Christmas story.
[3311.24 --> 3313.10]  So we're going to start that off today.
[3313.30 --> 3320.34]  And we are going to read a passage that's possibly the most skipped-over passage in the entire Bible
[3320.34 --> 3322.60]  that doesn't rhyme with Smoviticus.
[3322.60 --> 3326.18]  So turn with me to Matthew 1, verses 1 to 17.
[3326.32 --> 3329.16]  We're going to read the first 17 verses of Matthew 1.
[3329.44 --> 3330.36]  Pull out your Bibles.
[3330.46 --> 3331.52]  You can read along on the screen.
[3331.60 --> 3336.10]  Or you can read along on the nice banners there that our art team has put up.
[3336.32 --> 3339.82]  So Matthew 1, verses 1 to 17.
[3341.16 --> 3342.46]  It reads like this.
[3343.32 --> 3349.12]  This is the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
[3350.26 --> 3352.08]  Abraham was the father of Isaac.
[3352.38 --> 3353.76]  Isaac, the father of Jacob.
[3354.12 --> 3356.30]  Jacob, the father of Judah and his brothers.
[3356.90 --> 3360.64]  Judah, the father of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar.
[3361.30 --> 3362.76]  Perez, the father of Hezron.
[3363.08 --> 3364.50]  Hezron, the father of Ram.
[3365.08 --> 3366.70]  Ram, the father of Aminadab.
[3366.96 --> 3368.44]  Aminadab, the father of Nation.
[3368.90 --> 3370.24]  Nation, the father of Samon.
[3370.72 --> 3373.84]  Samon, the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab.
[3374.74 --> 3377.24]  Boaz, the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth.
[3378.08 --> 3379.28]  Obed, the father of Jesse.
[3379.40 --> 3381.50]  And Jesse, the father of King David.
[3382.42 --> 3386.36]  David was the father of Solomon, whose mother had been Uriah's wife.
[3387.16 --> 3388.88]  Solomon the father of Rehoboam.
[3389.36 --> 3390.92]  Rehoboam the father of Abijah.
[3391.22 --> 3392.70]  Abijah the father of Asa.
[3392.84 --> 3394.66]  Asa the father of Jehoshaphat.
[3395.18 --> 3396.70]  Jehoshaphat the father of Jehoram.
[3397.08 --> 3398.56]  Jehoram the father of Uzziah.
[3398.86 --> 3400.28]  Uzziah the father of Jotham.
[3400.58 --> 3401.98]  Jotham the father of Ahaz.
[3402.40 --> 3403.96]  Ahaz the father of Hezekiah.
[3404.70 --> 3406.42]  Hezekiah the father of Manasseh.
[3406.78 --> 3408.20]  Manasseh the father of Ammon.
[3408.68 --> 3410.68]  Ammon the father of Josiah.
[3410.68 --> 3416.40]  and Josiah, the father of Jeconia, and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.
[3417.64 --> 3422.86]  After the exile to Babylon, Jeconia was the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,
[3423.16 --> 3429.12]  Zerubbabel the father of Abihu, Abihu the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father of Azur, Azur the
[3429.12 --> 3435.60]  father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Akim, Akim the father of Elihud, Elihud the father of Eleazar,
[3435.60 --> 3441.16]  Eliezer the father of Mathan, Mathan the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Joseph,
[3441.52 --> 3447.26]  the husband of Mary, and Mary was the mother of Jesus who was called the Messiah. Thus there was
[3447.26 --> 3453.92]  14 generations in all from Abraham to David, 14 from David to the exile in Babylon, and 14 from the
[3453.92 --> 3462.94]  exile to the Messiah, the word of the Lord. That's a lot of names. When I was a kid my family was at
[3462.94 --> 3466.72]  some church function, I don't actually remember what this church function was, but I do remember
[3466.72 --> 3473.36]  that my dad had to read the text at this church function in front of a giant crowd. This text
[3473.36 --> 3478.22]  was from First Chronicles or something, it was much like a text we just read there today, a lot of names,
[3478.56 --> 3483.30]  I think even a lot of cities. Anyways, my dad started reading and he's muddling,
[3483.44 --> 3490.16]  Shaltiel begat the Zerubbabel and Zerubbabel begat it, and he's just stumbling and mispronouncing every
[3490.16 --> 3493.96]  word that's coming out of his mouth. And eventually he gets two, three, or four names and he stops,
[3494.56 --> 3497.94]  he looks up, everybody's sitting there, and he closes his Bible and he says, and there was a
[3497.94 --> 3504.68]  whole slew of them. The end. It was very funny. Everyone laughed, and I think everybody kind of
[3504.68 --> 3508.56]  empathized with him and they figured, yeah, we get it, people had kids, why are we reading this?
[3509.60 --> 3515.38]  I think we feel that way about this text too a little bit. Why does Matthew start the Christmas story
[3515.38 --> 3522.24]  with this genealogy? What's the point? What I hope we leave here today is that we get to understand
[3522.24 --> 3529.22]  that this passage gets to the heart, actually, of why Jesus came. This genealogy starts to deconstruct
[3529.22 --> 3534.14]  that fairy tale Christmas that we've built up in our minds because it highlights something so very
[3534.14 --> 3542.64]  important. The story shows that Jesus came into a mess from a mess because we are a mess.
[3542.64 --> 3551.30]  Jesus came into a mess, from a mess, for a mess. And to understand this well, just look at his family.
[3552.24 --> 3558.10]  The list on the wall right there speaks wonders. This is a who's who list of cheaters, liars,
[3558.28 --> 3564.76]  deceivers, schemers, murderers, adulterers, idol worshipers, child sacrificers, polygamists,
[3564.90 --> 3570.98]  and prostitutes. Jesus' genealogy reads like a giant list of thou shalt nots.
[3570.98 --> 3575.70]  I mean, we're not going to go into all of them because there's 42, but look at some of these names.
[3575.82 --> 3581.26]  Jacob, at the top, Jacob was known as a cheater and a fraudster. In fact, his name means the deceiver.
[3582.04 --> 3587.10]  He lied, he cheated, and he lived up to that name. So much so that God actually changed his name
[3587.10 --> 3594.08]  to Israel in Genesis 32. His son, Judah, he was super unrighteous. He wasn't a man of his word.
[3594.48 --> 3598.80]  He left his daughter-in-law without a husband when his son died. We'll get to that story in a minute.
[3598.80 --> 3602.84]  And as we learn in Genesis 38, he was not opposed to sleeping with prostitutes.
[3603.66 --> 3607.72]  Right off the bat, there's two dubious people. And these were the two guys that they decided to
[3607.72 --> 3615.14]  name their nation after, Israel and Judah. But we read on, and that list gets worse.
[3615.26 --> 3621.04]  Amon in 2 Kings 21, he was a league leader in idol worship. Jehoram in 2 Chronicles 21,
[3621.42 --> 3625.62]  he kills all of his brothers and a bunch of princes in order to keep the throne.
[3625.62 --> 3632.32]  Ahaz in 2 Kings 16, it's despicable. He sacrifices his child, makes his kid walk through fire in order
[3632.32 --> 3638.08]  to appease false gods. And Manasseh, who's been dubbed the most evil king in Israel's history,
[3638.66 --> 3642.74]  among the long list of sins that he committed, he seemingly served every single god that wasn't
[3642.74 --> 3647.82]  named Yahweh in existence. His story is in 2 Kings 21.
[3647.82 --> 3655.46]  Sadly, even the good kings in this list, even the ones who the Bible says they did good in the eyes of
[3655.46 --> 3662.42]  the Lord, are remembered for the sins that they committed. David was an adulterer. Solomon was as
[3662.42 --> 3667.86]  big a polygamist as ever existed. The few kings that say they did good in the eyes of the Lord,
[3667.92 --> 3673.10]  the majority of them left the high places up all over Jerusalem, where idol worship to false gods
[3673.10 --> 3682.92]  continued. This is not an esteemed list. This is Jesus' family. This is his family line. This
[3682.92 --> 3689.72]  this is his family line, this broken, messy, sinful family. They needed saving in the worst kind of way.
[3691.48 --> 3697.72]  Jesus came into this mess from a family that was a mess in order to save them.
[3697.72 --> 3704.16]  But it wasn't just his family, of course, that he came to save. And ironically, it's his family that
[3704.16 --> 3710.36]  point us to this truth. One of the most well-documented parts of this genealogy is the
[3710.36 --> 3718.10]  inclusion of four women, and five if you include Mary at the end. It wasn't just uncommon, sorry,
[3718.16 --> 3724.72]  to not include women in a genealogy. This is unheard of. This was never done. Ancient genealogies never
[3724.72 --> 3729.54]  recorded women. It was the men that kept the family lines going. It was the men that were documented.
[3729.66 --> 3734.84]  That's why having sons back then was so important in the times of scripture. Your family line would
[3734.84 --> 3739.50]  continue. And so it isn't just unique that Matthew includes these these women in the story. It is
[3739.50 --> 3749.46]  very telling. Because genealogies didn't include women, but Jesus did. They followed him in his ministry.
[3749.46 --> 3754.64]  They worked alongside of him in a special way. They were a part of his family line for a reason.
[3755.42 --> 3759.78]  We're going to quickly look at these four stories of these four women just to refresh our memories
[3759.78 --> 3764.20]  real quick. First of all, the first woman that's listed is Tamar. Her story's found in Genesis 38.
[3764.78 --> 3770.60]  Some of you may recall Tamar was married to Judah's oldest son, Ur. However, Ur was a very wicked man,
[3770.64 --> 3777.04]  and so God killed him before Tamar had any kids. As was the custom, Tamar was then betrothed to Judah's
[3777.04 --> 3783.24]  second son, Onan. But he was also terrible, and God also killed him. And so she's left as widow again
[3783.24 --> 3787.60]  without a child. Judah then promises Tamar, when my third and final son is old enough,
[3788.06 --> 3793.70]  he will marry you. However, that son grows up. Judah doesn't keep his promise. Tamar realizes
[3793.70 --> 3798.18]  she's not going to be married to him, and so she comes up with a plan. She dresses up as a prostitute
[3798.18 --> 3803.06]  and waits outside the city gates. There her father-in-law Judah comes rolling in, and with
[3803.06 --> 3810.14]  her face covered, Judah takes her, sleeps with her, and has no idea who she is. When it comes time to pay,
[3810.26 --> 3814.28]  Judah leaves his seal and his staff with her because he has no money on him. As a sort of collateral,
[3814.40 --> 3820.14]  he'll pay her later, he says. But you can imagine the rest. She gets pregnant. Judah finds out that her
[3820.14 --> 3824.88]  daughter-in-law has been sleeping around. He's furious, wants to stone her. She brings out the seal and the
[3824.88 --> 3831.72]  staff. Judah's ashamed. Tamar gets her justice. Judah gets his just dessert. And Tamar gives birth
[3831.72 --> 3839.60]  to twin boys, Zerah and Perez. Perez starts at the very beginning, the bloodline of Jesus.
[3840.50 --> 3845.76]  The second woman listed in the genealogy is Rahab. Her story's found in Joshua 2. Rahab was a
[3845.76 --> 3851.12]  prostitute. He was a prostitute and a citizen of Jericho when Joshua and the Israelites are about to
[3851.12 --> 3854.42]  come storming through. That's the story they're doing in children's worship time today. Not Rahab, but
[3854.42 --> 3860.44]  the Jericho. That's the tie-in from the children's story there. Joshua sends two spies into the city
[3860.44 --> 3864.90]  to do some reconnaissance before the battle. And when they get into trouble, Rahab hides them,
[3865.36 --> 3871.56]  keeps them safe. Rahab, in this incredible decision of faith, which acted against her community,
[3872.02 --> 3878.14]  her government, and its false gods, she risks her life and saves these two Israelite spies.
[3879.82 --> 3884.00]  She called on them and the one true God to save her family. And this act of faith
[3884.00 --> 3890.10]  saves her family. And she's welcome into the nation of Israel and becomes part of the bloodline of
[3890.10 --> 3896.70]  Jesus. The third woman listed is Ruth. Ruth was a Moabite woman who married a son of Naomi. So
[3896.70 --> 3901.68]  Naomi's her mother-in-law. But Naomi's husband and her two sons, Ruth's husband being one of them,
[3901.68 --> 3907.44]  they all die. So Naomi decides to go back to her hometown of Bethlehem to be with distant relatives.
[3907.44 --> 3913.48]  Instead of staying behind in Moab, like most women would have done, Ruth decides to stay with Naomi
[3913.48 --> 3919.22]  and goes with her to Bethlehem. There Ruth meets Boaz, this wealthy distant relative of Naomi and
[3919.22 --> 3925.38]  a man who did good in the eyes of the Lord. So Ruth is rewarded with her faithfulness to Naomi
[3925.38 --> 3934.24]  and becomes the great-grandmother to King David. King David. The fourth woman mentioned is Bathsheba.
[3934.52 --> 3939.00]  And what kind of mentioned? If you notice actually in verse 6 of our text, her name's not actually
[3939.00 --> 3945.86]  mentioned. She's just referred to as the one who was Uriah's wife. Well, Uriah's wife was bathing on
[3945.86 --> 3950.42]  the roof of her house with a name like Bathsheba. That seems a little bit too on point, but it's true.
[3950.42 --> 3956.58]  And there she is. And King David catches a good long glimpse of her. His lust takes over. He ends
[3956.58 --> 3963.52]  up calling her into the palace and commits adultery. Bathsheba gets pregnant. David needs to hide this.
[3963.62 --> 3968.70]  He tries to do some scheming. He ends up murdering Bathsheba's husband by sending him on the front lines
[3968.70 --> 3977.36]  of war. God calls him out on that. Nathan comes and says that he knows the pregnant Bathsheba's kid
[3977.36 --> 3983.10]  actually dies. But she ends up marrying David, having another son named Solomon. Solomon continues
[3983.10 --> 3990.26]  on the royal bloodline to Jesus. These are the four women that are mentioned. Let me ask you,
[3990.90 --> 3997.10]  other than the four of them being women, what do a cunning woman who seeks her own justice and her
[3997.10 --> 4003.34]  own rights in extreme and very unconventional ways, a prostitute who took an extreme leap of faith at the
[4003.34 --> 4010.18]  expense of everything she knew, a faithful woman who, again, stuck with her mother-in-law through thick
[4010.18 --> 4016.36]  and thin and everything, unlike any woman would do back then, and a victim of lust by a man known to
[4016.36 --> 4022.00]  many as the greatest king Israel, earthly king Israel ever had. What do those four have in common?
[4024.04 --> 4028.28]  There's a couple things. The first isn't noticed right away, but becomes pretty apparent.
[4028.28 --> 4035.96]  None of these four women are Jews. They were not of Jewish descent. They were Gentiles.
[4036.66 --> 4042.70]  Of course, all the men in Jesus' genealogy would have been Jews. They were of Israel. They had to be.
[4043.24 --> 4049.44]  But the women, none of them were Jewish. This is big because in Jesus' bloodline, it has Gentile blood
[4049.44 --> 4054.56]  in it. The Jewish people were just getting started, for example, when Tamar was in the picture, so she was
[4054.56 --> 4059.82]  certainly a Gentile. Rahab was from Jericho, so she was a Gentile. Ruth was a Moabite. That's not Jewish.
[4059.94 --> 4064.86]  She's a Gentile. And Bathsheba, we don't actually know for sure, except the only detail we know was
[4064.86 --> 4072.34]  that she was Uriah's wife, and we know Uriah was a Hittite, which is a Gentile. Verse 6 of our text
[4072.34 --> 4078.84]  makes sure to point that out. The fact that she was married to Uriah was a big deal. It was too important
[4078.84 --> 4085.10]  to leave out. So this inclusion of women, Jesus' genealogy, it breaks not just the gender mold.
[4086.94 --> 4095.20]  That's huge. But it also breaks down the racial and national mold. Jesus came for everyone,
[4095.56 --> 4102.60]  not just the Jews, because Jesus came from Gentiles as well. In fact, this genealogy breaks
[4102.60 --> 4107.20]  down so many barriers, many barriers that we as a society love to build up so that we can sort of
[4107.20 --> 4114.06]  draw lines in between each person. Jesus was born to save the men and the women. Jesus was born to
[4114.06 --> 4119.70]  save the young and the old, the good and the bad, and as this genealogy points out, the Gentiles and
[4119.70 --> 4125.64]  the Jews, all of which are mentioned here in our text today, all of which are a part of Jesus' birth
[4125.64 --> 4132.08]  story and our Advent season. This is beautiful. Jesus was born for all.
[4132.08 --> 4139.68]  There's a second thing that these women had in common, and it's worth highlighting this morning.
[4140.82 --> 4144.56]  All of these women subverted people's expectations.
[4147.18 --> 4153.38]  Again, like the men in this bloodline, these women weren't all saints, right? Rahab was a prostitute.
[4153.52 --> 4158.12]  Tamar pretended to be a prostitute to sleep with her father-in-law. The jury's out on if Bathsheba
[4158.12 --> 4162.64]  actually had anything to do with seducing David, though I think it's likely she's just a victim here.
[4163.80 --> 4170.26]  But more than that, God used each of these women to move his plan forward so much differently
[4170.26 --> 4178.40]  than anyone would have expected. Tamar had a kid with her father-in-law. Rahab wasn't part of Israel
[4178.40 --> 4184.76]  until she saved a couple of spies. If David had lived as God called him to, Bathsheba wouldn't be in the
[4184.76 --> 4191.88]  picture. And Ruth, Ruth comes along in probably the darkest time in Israel's history, the time
[4191.88 --> 4195.18]  of the judges. And if you want to know what that's like, read that book. It's horrifying.
[4196.16 --> 4202.78]  But this Moabite woman, not even a part of Israel, this Moabite woman faithfully bridges the gap
[4202.78 --> 4209.04]  between this evil, unfaithful nation and a royal family that's going to usher in the Messiah.
[4209.04 --> 4218.20]  They all subverted the expectations of this royal bloodline. There's a parallel here because while
[4218.20 --> 4223.74]  these women subverted the expectations placed on them, it actually foreshadows exactly the kind of
[4223.74 --> 4230.04]  Messiah that was coming from their bloodline. Because Jesus subverted the expectations of what
[4230.04 --> 4236.16]  it meant to be a Messiah. Jesus was not some political dynamo that people were expecting to come
[4236.16 --> 4242.78]  and rule the world. He was not this militant king ready to conquer the evil empires of the area. He
[4242.78 --> 4252.56]  was not the powerful face of change on billboards across Israel. He was a humble servant leading a
[4252.56 --> 4259.72]  bunch of fishermen, a bunch of tax collectors, a bunch of women around the country, sharing food with
[4259.72 --> 4266.44]  sinners and prostitutes, telling stories of what it means to love your neighbor, healing sick people,
[4266.88 --> 4276.84]  crying over friends who died, willingly laying down his life without a fight for the kingdom of his rule
[4276.84 --> 4280.18]  rather than standing up and fighting for it.
[4280.18 --> 4290.64]  It's like people didn't expect Tamar or Rahab to bear royal children. People were not expecting a Messiah like this.
[4292.74 --> 4302.62]  Jesus was born into this messy world. He was born of this messy family in order to save all of the messy people.
[4302.62 --> 4314.56]  He was born to be different, to subvert our expectations. He lived this life that we have all been called to live and yet fail to do so.
[4314.58 --> 4321.70]  And then he died a death that all of humanity deserves to die, a horrible, gruesome death in our place.
[4321.70 --> 4329.14]  But then on the third day, the penultimate act of cleaning up a mess, which started the moment Adam and Eve bit into that fruit.
[4329.78 --> 4330.46]  He rose again.
[4331.14 --> 4333.20]  And he defeated sin and death forever.
[4333.46 --> 4339.64]  And we await the ultimate act of him cleaning up this mess, where he will come again and clean everything up for good.
[4343.00 --> 4346.08]  That is what we are waiting for in this Advent season.
[4346.08 --> 4355.06]  Let's not try to make this Advent season so neat and tidy and clean, just like this picture that was up a while ago.
[4355.14 --> 4356.34]  It's going to be behind me. There it is.
[4356.68 --> 4357.92]  Let's not make Advent that.
[4359.74 --> 4361.20]  Christmas isn't that.
[4361.70 --> 4362.92]  Christmas can't be that.
[4364.34 --> 4365.96]  Friends, because we are not that.
[4367.44 --> 4368.56]  We are a mess.
[4368.62 --> 4369.74]  This world is a mess.
[4370.16 --> 4372.26]  It's been a mess ever since the fall.
[4373.02 --> 4374.48]  Jesus' family proves that.
[4374.48 --> 4376.54]  It's sinful.
[4376.74 --> 4377.28]  It's broken.
[4377.44 --> 4378.02]  It's messy.
[4378.32 --> 4384.10]  And while Jesus came to redeem the world, we await his second coming, which will clean it all up for good.
[4385.72 --> 4389.76]  Let's not make this Advent season so neat and tidy like this picture.
[4389.86 --> 4390.56]  It wasn't clean.
[4391.32 --> 4391.88]  It couldn't be.
[4393.26 --> 4395.94]  If it was, Jesus wouldn't have needed to come.
[4398.40 --> 4399.62]  I'm going to conclude with this.
[4399.62 --> 4406.06]  Looking at Jesus' genealogy, a fellow by the name of Raymond Brown, he writes this beautiful quote, beautiful line.
[4406.14 --> 4406.56]  It says this,
[4406.56 --> 4412.64]  The God who wrote the beginnings with crooked lines also writes the sequence with crooked lines.
[4413.24 --> 4416.92]  And some of those lines are our own lives, our own witness.
[4417.56 --> 4424.30]  A God who did not hesitate to use the scheming as well as the noble, the impure as well as the pure,
[4424.90 --> 4430.46]  men to whom the world hearkened and women upon whom the world frowned.
[4431.24 --> 4435.22]  This God continues to work through the same means.
[4435.22 --> 4439.10]  We are a mess.
[4439.20 --> 4442.94]  We are those crooked lines, just like those 42 people listed on that wall over there.
[4443.52 --> 4448.00]  And yet God has always written his story using crooked lines.
[4449.34 --> 4454.54]  And so this Christmas, this Advent season, let's not try too hard to straighten them.
[4455.74 --> 4457.72]  Let's acknowledge that they are crooked.
[4461.12 --> 4464.72]  Let's not falsify what this Christmas story actually looked like.
[4465.22 --> 4466.82]  Let's acknowledge the mess.
[4466.82 --> 4466.84]  Let's acknowledge the mess.
[4466.84 --> 4472.06]  Because when we look through that lens, we can really start to understand the grace
[4472.06 --> 4475.04]  that he brought for us all.
[4476.72 --> 4480.94]  Acknowledging the mess is the lens with which we need to view this Christmas story.
[4480.94 --> 4484.64]  In fact, it's the lens with which we need to view all our stories.
[4485.44 --> 4493.16]  Because then Christ's coming at Christmas, and is dying on Good Friday, and is rising on Easter.
[4493.66 --> 4496.80]  They all become so much more significant.
[4497.48 --> 4506.06]  When we understand the mess, we truly understand why Christ came and what he accomplished for all of us.
[4506.06 --> 4511.64]  And so we're going to unhaul our Christmas this year in order to see that mess.
[4512.20 --> 4518.72]  And truly understand, as we talked about this morning, the hope that we have in the grace and the mercy
[4518.72 --> 4523.66]  found in Jesus' birth, life, death, and resurrection.
[4523.98 --> 4524.16]  Amen?
[4525.28 --> 4526.00]  Let's pray.
[4526.00 --> 4534.12]  Father in heaven, we thank you for this Advent season.
[4534.74 --> 4541.46]  We thank you for this season where we can sit and look at the mess that this world is.
[4541.46 --> 4550.48]  And God, we can sit and we can hope in you, in your coming at Christmas, in your birth,
[4550.80 --> 4554.08]  and your coming ultimately in the end to come and clean up this mess.
[4554.24 --> 4556.92]  We can long for that in this Advent season.
[4557.00 --> 4558.60]  So don't let us rush through that.
[4558.68 --> 4560.84]  Don't let us try to tidy this up ourselves.
[4561.04 --> 4564.12]  Don't let us try to paint a better picture of what life is.
[4564.20 --> 4569.24]  Don't let us romanticize Advent or romanticize Christmas.
[4569.24 --> 4573.06]  But let us know that you have come and saved it.
[4573.16 --> 4574.86]  You have come to redeem it.
[4574.92 --> 4579.72]  And you will come again to bring in your glory forever and ever.
[4580.96 --> 4584.64]  May that be the truth of this season for us this year.
[4584.98 --> 4586.46]  We pray this in your son's precious name.
[4586.88 --> 4587.12]  Amen.
[4599.24 --> 4628.96]  Come, thou long-expected Jesus.
[4628.96 --> 4634.94]  Born to set thy people free
[4634.94 --> 4641.02]  From our fears and sins release us
[4641.02 --> 4647.44]  Let us find our rest in thee
[4647.44 --> 4654.80]  Israel's strength and consolation
[4654.80 --> 4660.76]  Hope of all the earth thou art
[4660.76 --> 4666.80]  Dear desire of every nation
[4666.80 --> 4673.80]  Joy of every longing heart
[4675.44 --> 4680.80]  Born thy people to deliver
[4680.80 --> 4686.80]  Born a child and yet a king
[4687.70 --> 4692.80]  Born to reign in us forever
[4693.64 --> 4699.80]  Now thy gracious kingdom bring
[4699.80 --> 4707.98]  By thine own eternal spirit
[4707.98 --> 4713.92]  Rule in all our hearts alone
[4713.92 --> 4719.80]  By thine all sufficient merit
[4719.80 --> 4727.54]  Raise us to thy glorious throne
[4727.54 --> 4750.94]  And so as we go out into this week, as we start Advent this Sunday, let's remember the mess that Christmas was, that Advent is, that this world is, and not glorify in that, but glorify in the God who sent his Son to redeem it.
[4750.94 --> 4761.88]  We are going to have the blessing today, but I am going to invite Pastor Dan Hoagland who is going to lead us in this blessing today as he is here and we thought we would take advantage of that.
[4761.88 --> 4763.66]  So Pastor Dan, come on forward.
[4764.86 --> 4765.44]  Here's the mic.
[4765.54 --> 4766.06]  Here's the mic.
[4766.62 --> 4767.32]  Oh, look at that.
[4767.70 --> 4768.02]  Look at that.
[4768.36 --> 4768.48]  Yeah.
[4768.48 --> 4772.18]  It's nice to see all of you.
[4772.60 --> 4773.30]  Really good.
[4773.56 --> 4778.02]  So thanks for Kevin for allowing me this and Pastor Chris as well.
[4778.56 --> 4784.70]  We had a good chat earlier this week and good to see you well and to see all of your children growing up.
[4784.98 --> 4789.84]  Oh man, I remember when so many of them were born and it was a privilege to be a part of your life.
[4790.56 --> 4791.62]  It's interesting.
[4791.62 --> 4797.56]  I think the pandemic created a little bit of a time warp and so you might not be sure how long I've actually been gone.
[4797.56 --> 4798.48]  It's been three years.
[4800.06 --> 4802.58]  Aren't pandemics fun to go through as congregations?
[4802.70 --> 4808.02]  I've heard there's been lots of excitement here and we've had excitement in our congregation as well.
[4808.28 --> 4811.34]  So, but life is good for us in Fredericton.
[4811.60 --> 4812.58]  We're happy there.
[4812.68 --> 4813.12]  We're content.
[4813.34 --> 4814.44]  The church is good to us.
[4814.84 --> 4823.66]  But I know that being back, I'm reminded that there is and always will be a part of my heart that remains in Langley and with this congregation.
[4823.66 --> 4830.34]  And so, thanks for those who have just been kind and good to me, just even coming into the sanctuary this morning.
[4830.88 --> 4834.50]  And as we go from this place, God is going to send us with his blessing.
[4834.94 --> 4838.64]  I think Kristen and my kids, the rest of my kids at home are also watching.
[4839.38 --> 4841.84]  For them, they're missing being here too.
[4842.12 --> 4843.98]  And next summer, we hope to come out.
[4844.02 --> 4845.86]  My parents have their 50th wedding anniversary.
[4845.86 --> 4849.42]  So, we'll definitely stop in and say hello then with everyone.
[4850.04 --> 4852.46]  We'll receive these words of blessing from our God.
[4853.64 --> 4863.98]  May the love of God the Father, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be and remain with you always.
[4864.64 --> 4865.72]  All God's people said.
[4865.72 --> 4865.78]  Amen.
[4865.78 --> 4866.78]  Amen.
[4866.78 --> 4867.12]  Amen.
[4867.12 --> 4867.78]  Amen.
[4867.78 --> 4867.84]  Amen.
[4867.84 --> 4868.84]  Amen.
[4868.84 --> 4869.84]  Amen.
[4869.84 --> 4869.88]  Amen.
[4869.88 --> 4869.92]  Amen.
[4875.86 --> 4905.84]  Amen.
[4905.86 --> 4935.84]  Amen.
[4935.84 --> 4936.84]  Amen.
[4936.84 --> 4938.18]  Amen.
[4938.18 --> 4945.84]  Amen.
[4945.84 --> 4950.84]  Amen.
[4950.84 --> 4954.84]  Amen.
[4959.84 --> 4965.12]  Amen.
[4965.12 --> 4965.26]  Amen.
[4965.26 --> 4965.74]  Amen.
[4965.74 --> 4965.82]  Mouse.
[4965.82 --> 4974.64]  Son of God and Son of God
[4974.64 --> 4980.20]  There before the world began
[4980.20 --> 4986.74]  Born to suffer, born to save
[4986.74 --> 4994.86]  Born to raise us from the grave
[4994.86 --> 5003.00]  For us the everlasting Lord
[5003.00 --> 5009.12]  We shall reign forevermore
[5009.12 --> 5016.60]  No matter, no matter
[5016.60 --> 5023.74]  Come and see what honor has done
[5023.74 --> 5030.88]  Noel, Noel
[5030.88 --> 5037.88]  The story of amazing love
[5037.88 --> 5041.88]  The light of the world
[5041.88 --> 5045.88]  Living for us

[5078.16 --> 5082.30]  Given for us

[5085.30 --> 5092.44]  Noel, Noel

[5119.58 --> 5119.88]  Summer
[5119.88 --> 5149.86]  Thank you.
[5149.88 --> 5179.86]  Thank you.

[5299.86 --> 5301.86]  Thank you.
