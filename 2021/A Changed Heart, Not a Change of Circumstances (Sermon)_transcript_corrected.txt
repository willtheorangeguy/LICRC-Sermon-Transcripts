[0.00 → 7.62] We're going to take some time today and look at Habakkuk 3.
[8.04 → 10.60] We're going to read verse 1 to 16, and we'll get to that in a moment.
[10.70 → 17.00] First, let me just acknowledge that what you're seeing on screen this week looks a little different from what you have seen in the past.
[17.58 → 32.10] We are ever adapting and trying to find ways to better communicate and better translate the message across the air and through your screens into your living room and find ways to do that well.
[32.30 → 35.88] And so we've put together this side set.
[36.00 → 38.44] I'm still here in church, in the sanctuary.
[38.64 → 42.32] There are, you know, nine other people here with me as well.
[42.32 → 48.78] But it just looks a little different, and we hope it looks a little bit better as you are sitting where you are.
[49.84 → 58.38] Before we read together, I just want to introduce kind of where we're going, and then we'll read so you can see that along the way.
[58.64 → 60.46] And do that with a bit of a story.
[60.58 → 64.06] Now, some of you know the story of John Newton.
[64.64 → 70.86] John Newton was an 18th century sailor and slaver on a ship called the Greyhound.
[70.86 → 80.18] Now, at one time in the mid-18th century, they were sailing in the North Atlantic, and a storm rose up and had all but wrecked the ship.
[80.28 → 93.48] The masts were broken, the sails were torn, and all the sailors had spent hours and days using the pumps, the crank pumps, to try and empty out the hull of the ship, of the water that was gathering.
[93.48 → 107.70] Newton has been exhausted from days of this labour, and so instead of taking a break, he ends up tying himself to the helm of the ship so that he might steer it, even as he struggles with exhaustion.
[108.66 → 112.08] Now, Newton's story is a special one.
[112.08 → 121.44] Newton, he had a reputation for profanity and coarseness and debauchery that shocked even other sailors during that day.
[122.08 → 125.26] He was known as the Great Blasphemer.
[125.26 → 133.96] Now, the story goes, actually, that Newton was an evangelist for unbelief at this time in his life.
[135.16 → 142.08] But on that day, strapped to the helm of that ship, God did something to Newton.
[142.08 → 151.68] And from that moment forward, and you can read about this in his journals as they tell a story of a man who is transformed and slowly being transformed.
[152.14 → 162.06] And so he began to read the Bible regularly, and he began to read books published by other Christian authors to help teach him faith and discipleship and what that might be like.
[162.06 → 169.78] And it took a few years, yes, but after a few years, he left the slaving industry and became a tide surveyor in Liverpool.
[169.78 → 177.72] And then, in 1764, at the age of 39, which is just two years older than me, he became a minister.
[178.92 → 188.88] Now, for the evening services and the little church that he served in Olney, he would publish hymns with his friend and fellow parishioner, William Cowper.
[189.60 → 195.40] One of the hymns that they published has gone on to infamy, and it's called Amazing Grace.
[195.40 → 205.24] God took a cussing, slave-trading, degenerate of a man, changed his heart, and turned him into a gospel preacher.
[206.70 → 208.32] This is what God does.
[209.70 → 209.90] Right?
[209.96 → 212.46] Think of the story from the Bible of the Apostle Paul.
[213.04 → 213.22] Right?
[213.24 → 219.86] The Apostle Paul was, quite literally, in today's terms, a state-sponsored murdering terrorist.
[219.86 → 228.82] And God made him into the greatest missionary that the world has ever known, and used him to author more than half of the New Testament.
[230.32 → 233.36] In different ways, this is my story.
[234.42 → 239.44] Differently from that, this is your story, if you believe.
[240.30 → 240.48] Right?
[240.52 → 242.64] These are stories of transformation.
[243.12 → 243.22] Right?
[243.24 → 245.98] The gospel of Jesus transforms you.
[245.98 → 248.42] Jesus changes your heart.
[249.70 → 250.84] And that's this story.
[251.54 → 257.80] That's the story that we're going to see and read the fruit of in Habakkuk 3.
[258.10 → 261.32] And so if you have a Bible in front of you, I encourage you to open that up.
[261.92 → 263.22] Turn to Habakkuk 3.
[263.34 → 266.12] We will look more closely at some of the verses there.
[266.70 → 268.60] It will be on the screen as I read it.
[268.60 → 274.46] But of course, I always encourage you to have one open in front of you, or on in front of you, if you use your phone.
[274.46 → 278.66] This is from Habakkuk 3, beginning at verse 1.
[280.18 → 284.30] A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet on Sidenote.
[284.30 → 306.96] God came from Texan, the Holy One from Mount Pagan.
[306.96 → 311.12] His glory covered the heavens, and his praise filled the earth.
[311.98 → 314.06] His splendour was like the sunrise.
[314.44 → 317.24] Rays flashed from his hand where his power was hidden.
[318.38 → 320.06] Plague went before him.
[320.56 → 322.10] Pestilence followed his steps.
[322.42 → 323.96] He stood and shook the earth.
[324.28 → 326.24] He looked and made the nations tremble.
[326.54 → 330.46] The ancient mountains crumbled and the age-old hills collapsed.
[331.46 → 333.84] His ways are eternal.
[333.84 → 340.32] I saw the tents of Cushman in distress, the dwellings of Median in anguish.
[341.24 → 343.24] Were you angry with the rivers, O Lord?
[343.30 → 344.96] Was your wrath against the streams?
[345.24 → 349.94] Did you rage against the sea when you rode with your horses and your victorious chariots?
[350.14 → 351.70] You uncovered your bow.
[351.88 → 353.30] You called for many arrows.
[353.86 → 355.70] You split the earth with rivers.
[355.86 → 357.70] The mountains saw you and writhed.
[358.04 → 359.58] Torrents of water swept by.
[359.58 → 362.68] The deep roared and lifted its waves on high.
[363.88 → 369.32] Sun and moon stood still in the heavens at the glint of your flying arrows,
[369.54 → 372.08] at the lightning of your flashing spear.
[372.98 → 377.56] In wrath you strode through the earth, and in anger you threshed the nations.
[377.98 → 382.50] You came out to deliver your people, to save your anointed one.
[382.50 → 385.48] You crushed the leader of the land of wickedness.
[385.60 → 387.74] You stripped him from head to foot.
[388.62 → 391.28] With his own spear you pierced his head.
[391.46 → 396.70] When his warriors stormed out to scatter us, gloating as though about to devour the wretched
[396.70 → 402.80] who were in hiding, you trampled the sea with your horses, churning the great waters.
[402.80 → 408.12] I heard, and my heart pounded.
[408.38 → 410.38] My lips quivered at the sound.
[410.50 → 413.58] Decay crept into my bones, and my legs trembled.
[414.50 → 424.14] Yet, I will wait patiently for the day of calamity to come on the nation invading us.
[425.08 → 426.44] This is the word of the Lord.
[426.44 → 426.50] Amen.
[432.80 → 436.68] As I said, this is a story of change.
[438.14 → 442.52] And in chapter 3, there is a change that takes place.
[442.56 → 447.18] With your Bibles, look back to chapter 1, the very first words of the book, right?
[447.26 → 448.92] Chapter 1, verse 1 says,
[449.30 → 451.96] An oracle Habakkuk received.
[453.00 → 456.24] And then, if you've been with us for the last couple of weeks, right,
[456.24 → 461.58] you've seen that Habakkuk expresses himself in the form of two complaints.
[461.58 → 466.62] And as we've seen, he's pretty bold and brazen in those complaints.
[466.66 → 469.32] And he's really struggling, right?
[469.34 → 473.34] He complains, and he cries out, and he calls for justice.
[473.76 → 480.26] At one point in the story, in the text, he even seems to challenge God, right, to call him out.
[483.32 → 489.60] And in case it hasn't been clear over these last few weeks, God can handle that.
[489.60 → 493.08] God wants your complaints.
[494.30 → 495.72] His shoulders are big enough.
[496.56 → 497.82] He can handle your challenge.
[498.16 → 499.42] He can handle your frustrations.
[499.54 → 500.70] He can handle your anger.
[501.34 → 507.42] And so, like Habakkuk, like Job, like so many of the psalmists that we can read, give it to him.
[508.38 → 508.62] Right?
[509.02 → 511.86] If you're mad at God, tell him.
[511.86 → 515.48] If you don't get it, ask him.
[516.14 → 516.36] Right?
[516.38 → 523.02] If you are righteously indignant, or perhaps it's better to say, if you're right pissed off, yell at God.
[524.08 → 525.26] He can take it.
[526.24 → 527.40] He can handle it.
[527.72 → 527.92] Right?
[527.96 → 529.14] He is big enough.
[529.28 → 530.24] I promise you.
[530.24 → 533.98] And let's be clear, okay?
[535.54 → 541.18] Yelling at God is the language of faith for those facing injustice.
[542.88 → 546.74] Yelling at God is the language of faith for the brokenhearted.
[548.68 → 552.76] Yelling at God is better than walking away in apathy.
[552.76 → 564.84] By analogy, I would rather my friend get loudly angry at me and yell at me than seethe in silence and never talk to me.
[566.82 → 571.20] But, but know this.
[571.70 → 572.52] Remember this.
[573.02 → 573.16] Right?
[573.22 → 578.76] If God is big enough to handle your anger and your yelling, and he is.
[578.76 → 579.26] Right?
[579.30 → 587.96] If God is big enough to handle your anger and your yelling, that means he is also big enough to have reasons beyond your comprehension.
[589.06 → 589.60] Right?
[589.62 → 590.86] It can only be both.
[591.78 → 592.10] Right?
[592.12 → 601.68] You can't complain to God that he should be doing something different, but then reject the possibility that God is, in fact, doing something different.
[601.68 → 610.00] I think that's the lesson that Habakkuk has learned by the time he gets to chapter 3.
[610.96 → 611.44] Right?
[611.48 → 616.50] That's the lesson that Habakkuk has learned from listening to God speak in chapter 2.
[617.52 → 617.92] Right?
[618.00 → 621.74] As we said, there's something that has changed here.
[621.84 → 625.12] Something has changed between chapter 2 and chapter 3.
[625.38 → 625.62] Right?
[625.64 → 630.86] The book starts with his complaints and with God's oracle, and then chapter 3 is something else.
[630.86 → 633.06] And look at the superscription.
[633.44 → 633.60] Right?
[633.66 → 635.84] It's verse 1 in the text that we read.
[635.90 → 639.14] Now, real quick, let me just put on my Bible teacher hat for a moment.
[639.22 → 639.86] Let's just pause.
[640.32 → 642.80] I don't know what your Bibles might say.
[642.98 → 649.98] Mine, the NIV, has a heading that begins chapter 3 saying Habakkuk's Prayer.
[650.04 → 652.06] That's written there in italics.
[652.22 → 653.72] That's put in there by the editors.
[654.52 → 654.64] Right?
[654.68 → 658.06] That's not part of the text as God's infallible word.
[658.10 → 659.36] That's put in there to help us.
[659.36 → 665.84] But verse 1, right, what's called the superscript, that's part of the authoritative text.
[665.96 → 669.44] And there we read a prayer of Habakkuk.
[670.40 → 676.00] And I want to suggest to you that that line is God telling us that this is something different.
[677.56 → 678.06] Right?
[678.08 → 683.44] That Habakkuk's posture has changed from protest to prayer.
[683.44 → 684.44] Right?
[684.48 → 689.04] From wrecked and whining to wrecked and worshipping.
[689.92 → 690.04] Right?
[690.10 → 696.24] Habakkuk has had a change of heart and not a change of circumstances.
[697.56 → 704.82] Habakkuk has had an encounter with the living God speaking directly to his heart that affects how he sees everything else.
[704.82 → 711.42] And not just how he sees everything else, but what and how he does everything else.
[711.42 → 711.70] Right?
[711.74 → 715.92] In short, an encounter with the living God changes everything.
[715.92 → 721.88] And that's what this word is.
[722.52 → 723.20] Right?
[723.28 → 730.04] God speaking into your life and situation to give you new eyes to see by and a new purpose to live for.
[730.60 → 731.22] Right?
[731.26 → 733.90] That's what this worship is for.
[734.46 → 735.10] Right?
[735.16 → 741.46] For God carrying you into his presence by the power of the Spirit and breathing new life into your dry bones.
[741.46 → 743.64] That's who church is.
[743.64 → 743.96] Right?
[744.02 → 753.70] A community of broken people raised up in new birth into a living hope with the mission of God coursing through us and out to all the world by us.
[754.58 → 756.90] That's what's happening in Habakkuk.
[757.24 → 761.48] His heart is being changed with an encounter with God.
[761.58 → 761.66] Right?
[761.74 → 769.04] Habakkuk is learning to trust God's ultimately unsearchable plan for establishing his kingdom.
[769.04 → 780.20] And in his learning to trust in God's plan, he begins to offer a prayer of trust and a prayer of confidence that grows with reverence and awe at who God is.
[781.40 → 784.14] And that's our goal as we dig into this text.
[784.66 → 784.78] Right?
[784.86 → 792.02] Learning how to trust God's plan and purpose for establishing his kingdom and giving ourselves in trust and confidence.
[792.18 → 797.18] And thereby increasing our capacity for reverence and awe.
[797.18 → 798.98] So we're going to see that.
[799.30 → 800.48] We're going to dig in here.
[800.60 → 804.52] And in these verses of Habakkuk, I want to show you two things.
[805.22 → 812.42] And so in the time that we have left, part one of that will be what I'm calling the responsibility to remember rightly.
[813.10 → 819.02] And then part two will be viewing our lives through valued virtues.
[819.02 → 825.30] So the responsibility to remember rightly and then viewing our lives through valued virtues.
[825.66 → 831.82] And before we dig too far into that, I want you to quickly notice a sort of theological principle operating here.
[831.94 → 832.14] Right?
[832.18 → 841.52] There's a reciprocal relationship between a changed heart and the responsibility to remember rightly and to view our lives through these virtues.
[841.52 → 843.26] And what I mean is this.
[844.04 → 844.32] Right?
[844.40 → 846.88] First, God changes your heart.
[846.96 → 849.42] That is his gift of regeneration.
[850.02 → 850.20] Right?
[850.22 → 855.52] He changes your heart and with that comes the responsibility of faith and the formation of faith.
[855.52 → 855.96] Right?
[856.00 → 862.70] We respond to God changing our heart by digging into his word, by worshipping him in life and with the church.
[862.70 → 870.62] And we respond by becoming part of a community of heart changed people who are learning to view our lives through these virtues.
[871.58 → 875.30] But at the same time, the reverse works as well.
[875.30 → 876.06] Right?
[876.22 → 884.58] As we learn to view life through certain virtues, as we learn practices of remembering rightly, our hearts are changed.
[886.08 → 891.92] In theological terms, what we're talking about is the relationship between justification and sanctification.
[891.92 → 895.38] Justification happens in response to the word.
[895.82 → 899.58] Sanctification happens in responding to the word.
[900.38 → 900.58] Right?
[900.64 → 908.42] Your heart is changed, and your heart is changing through discipline and discipleship being transformed by the Holy Spirit.
[910.04 → 919.56] And so, what does it mean for us and Habakkuk with the responsibility to remember rightly?
[919.56 → 923.66] What is the responsibility to remember rightly?
[923.82 → 926.02] And so, look at verse 2.
[926.38 → 927.42] The first part of verse 2.
[928.32 → 928.98] Habakkuk says,
[929.46 → 931.50] Lord, I have heard of your fame.
[931.70 → 933.96] I stand in awe of your deeds.
[934.34 → 935.10] Oh, Lord.
[935.38 → 935.56] Right?
[935.60 → 938.40] I've heard of your fame and I stand in awe of your deeds.
[938.70 → 942.28] Habakkuk is remembering what God has done.
[942.28 → 955.82] He is learning to look at part of what God has done in the past through the lens of a worldview and a theology that says God is sovereign over all creation.
[955.82 → 959.84] That he is big enough to handle our anger and our frustration.
[959.84 → 965.52] But also, that he is big enough to have a purpose beyond our comprehension.
[965.52 → 968.78] That's what it means to remember rightly.
[969.40 → 969.60] Right?
[969.64 → 974.82] That even as we see part of the picture, we know that there are details beyond our sight lines.
[975.60 → 975.80] Right?
[975.84 → 981.96] Even if we could see those details, right, we wouldn't understand them or be able to make sense of them.
[981.96 → 986.54] But what we can see, what we can remember is enough.
[986.54 → 996.96] What we can rightly remember is proof enough, is cause enough to drive us to the virtues that we'll outline in a moment.
[997.74 → 1002.48] Now, quickly, let's look at what Habakkuk is remembering.
[1003.42 → 1005.92] In verse 3, he prays,
[1005.92 → 1009.56] God came from T-Man, the Holy One from Mount Perez.
[1009.96 → 1013.88] Now, T-Man is a city or a region in southern Edom.
[1013.88 → 1020.40] Mount Perez, the location is not precisely known, but based on the stories and the general references,
[1020.88 → 1022.88] we know that it is to the southeast of Israel.
[1023.72 → 1030.60] Actually, we have a map that we can put up on the screen for you that will help you see these place names
[1030.60 → 1035.36] and the purpose, once you see them all together, of mentioning them.
[1036.50 → 1039.14] So with that map, you can see in verse 5,
[1039.14 → 1044.28] quickly, Habakkuk mentions plagues and pestilence that go before him.
[1044.28 → 1049.36] It's probably recalling of Egypt, right, and the ten plagues in the Exodus story.
[1049.94 → 1052.54] Verse 7 mentions Cushman and Median.
[1053.22 → 1058.54] Cushman is a part of the southern Transjordan region, same with Median.
[1058.54 → 1067.54] In fact, Median, or at least two certain Mediates, is where Moses flees from Pharaoh
[1067.54 → 1070.42] when God speaks to him in the burning bush.
[1071.72 → 1077.78] Now, take that all together, and what Habakkuk is seeing, what he is remembering,
[1078.34 → 1083.12] is God coming from the region that on your map there is in that little circle, right?
[1083.12 → 1086.88] The region where Mount Sinai is located.
[1088.06 → 1090.70] All right, Sinai, if you remember the story, if you know the story,
[1090.76 → 1094.18] is where God meets Moses, where God meets the people.
[1094.36 → 1097.32] Sinai is the climax of the story of the Exodus.
[1097.56 → 1102.74] Sinai is the place where, for the first time in generations upon generations,
[1102.74 → 1108.56] the people see the glory of God, where the glory of God descends and dwells with its people,
[1108.56 → 1113.72] where it did so and affected the face of Moses every time that he came into God's presence,
[1113.78 → 1117.66] such that he radiated God's glory and had to wear a veil, right?
[1117.66 → 1128.62] These place names in the prayer situate Habakkuk in a historical reality of God's redemption before his people.
[1128.62 → 1136.42] And then, as if buoyed by remembering rightly,
[1137.60 → 1143.66] Habakkuk switches almost into this beautiful poem in verses 8 through 15
[1143.66 → 1145.62] that we're not going to look at line by line,
[1145.74 → 1148.44] but I encourage you to come back to it sometime this week.
[1148.84 → 1153.88] And it comes across as a sort of description of reality
[1153.88 → 1161.18] as Habakkuk is almost seeing the world and world history through God's eyes, right?
[1161.20 → 1165.14] It's a poetic and theological account of God's working in the world
[1165.14 → 1169.70] to deliver Israel from Egypt and from the armies of Pharaoh who chased them.
[1170.42 → 1173.62] Now, in this, Habakkuk might also be seeing,
[1173.62 → 1178.16] as history sort of layers on itself when God stands above time,
[1178.56 → 1183.62] is also seeing God carrying David through battles against the Philistines
[1183.62 → 1187.68] or God securing victory for the Israelites in the time of Hezekiah
[1187.68 → 1190.78] and the advancing armies of Sennacherib,
[1190.90 → 1193.62] who marched through Israel towards Jerusalem
[1193.62 → 1196.82] only to be utterly destroyed by an angel of the Lord
[1196.82 → 1199.44] coming into their camp as they gathered around the walls
[1199.44 → 1202.78] such that 185,000 soldiers were killed.
[1203.54 → 1209.38] And Sennacherib eventually went back to his home city of Nineveh
[1209.38 → 1213.40] where he was a leader, and he was killed by his sons.
[1213.62 → 1215.56] As he worshipped in a temple.
[1216.32 → 1220.18] And that could be the referent for verse 14 of our text, right?
[1220.44 → 1221.18] Where it says,
[1221.40 → 1224.16] With his own spear you pierced his head.
[1225.28 → 1225.52] Right?
[1225.56 → 1227.68] An enemy of God killed by his own sons.
[1227.84 → 1230.20] With his own spear you pierced his head.
[1230.64 → 1231.56] Either way,
[1231.74 → 1234.12] what you see in the grand scheme of things
[1234.12 → 1236.40] and the big drama that is redemption
[1236.40 → 1238.72] focused here through the people of Israel
[1238.72 → 1241.26] Israel is that Pharaoh received justice.
[1241.46 → 1243.90] God protected and provided for David
[1243.90 → 1246.06] and Sennacherib knew punishment.
[1246.50 → 1246.62] Right?
[1246.70 → 1247.68] And so, too,
[1248.04 → 1250.06] will Judah in Habakkuk's day.
[1250.60 → 1250.76] Right?
[1250.80 → 1253.00] The unjust leaders of Judah
[1253.00 → 1254.96] and from the temple and religious system
[1254.96 → 1257.58] will face justice from God
[1257.58 → 1259.38] in the form of exile to Babylon.
[1259.38 → 1260.76] And then greater still,
[1260.92 → 1261.28] Babylon,
[1261.56 → 1262.88] used as an instrument of God's tool,
[1262.98 → 1266.40] will face justice in the form of Cyrus the Persian.
[1266.86 → 1267.12] Right?
[1267.20 → 1269.48] Down and down it goes through history.
[1269.62 → 1271.18] God guiding the way
[1271.18 → 1274.80] to reveal his plan and purpose of redemption.
[1275.20 → 1275.44] You see,
[1275.54 → 1277.24] we may not know the details,
[1277.24 → 1280.48] but we have it even better
[1280.48 → 1283.20] because we know the God
[1283.20 → 1284.90] who controls the details.
[1286.58 → 1288.54] I think about the story, right?
[1288.74 → 1289.76] Consider Joseph.
[1290.12 → 1290.84] Joseph, who,
[1291.12 → 1292.34] as a young man,
[1292.50 → 1293.80] a pretty arrogant young man,
[1293.92 → 1294.14] sure,
[1294.28 → 1296.42] was beaten and abused
[1296.42 → 1297.82] and left for dead
[1297.82 → 1299.40] but then sold into slavery
[1299.40 → 1300.52] by his brothers.
[1301.24 → 1301.56] Joseph,
[1301.72 → 1302.86] who was falsely accused
[1302.86 → 1303.76] of horrible crimes
[1303.76 → 1304.68] and thrown into prison
[1304.68 → 1306.62] and sat there for years
[1306.62 → 1308.90] Joseph,
[1309.12 → 1309.36] who,
[1310.50 → 1312.18] when he finally got to meet his brothers,
[1313.32 → 1313.78] said,
[1314.34 → 1316.34] what you intended for evil,
[1316.94 → 1319.10] God intended for good.
[1319.84 → 1321.14] I think of Job, right?
[1321.22 → 1321.46] Job,
[1321.56 → 1323.28] who lost everything,
[1324.26 → 1324.40] right?
[1324.48 → 1324.76] Job,
[1324.86 → 1326.92] who struggled in innumerable
[1326.92 → 1328.82] and immeasurable ways
[1328.82 → 1329.44] and still,
[1329.58 → 1331.04] after all of that struggling,
[1331.46 → 1331.78] said,
[1331.90 → 1334.10] I know that you can do all things,
[1334.10 → 1336.58] that no plan of yours can be thwarted.
[1337.62 → 1338.82] Or to think of Paul,
[1338.92 → 1340.54] who we've already made reference to,
[1340.98 → 1341.12] who,
[1341.24 → 1341.46] Paul,
[1341.58 → 1344.02] who regularly faced death,
[1344.14 → 1345.60] who regularly stood opposed
[1345.60 → 1346.30] to the religious
[1346.30 → 1348.34] and political authorities,
[1348.34 → 1349.04] who says,
[1349.50 → 1349.74] no,
[1350.00 → 1351.30] in all things
[1351.30 → 1353.02] we are more than conquerors
[1353.02 → 1353.66] through him
[1353.66 → 1355.08] who loved us.
[1355.14 → 1356.12] For I am convinced
[1356.12 → 1356.94] that neither death
[1356.94 → 1357.70] nor life,
[1357.78 → 1358.72] neither angels nor demons,
[1358.84 → 1359.54] neither the present
[1359.54 → 1360.14] nor the future,
[1360.22 → 1361.38] nor any powers,
[1361.66 → 1362.74] neither height nor depth,
[1362.74 → 1363.32] nor anything
[1363.32 → 1364.30] in all creation,
[1364.50 → 1366.14] will be able to separate us
[1366.14 → 1367.18] from the love of God
[1367.18 → 1367.82] that is available
[1367.82 → 1368.84] in Christ Jesus,
[1369.32 → 1369.88] our Lord.
[1371.54 → 1373.68] Just because you don't understand it
[1373.68 → 1375.88] doesn't mean it's not there.
[1377.98 → 1379.10] God is able to take
[1379.10 → 1382.00] the most horrific evil
[1382.00 → 1383.22] in the world,
[1383.78 → 1385.78] his own death
[1385.78 → 1387.96] on an instrument of Roman torture,
[1387.96 → 1391.04] and he's able to turn that
[1391.04 → 1393.30] into the greatest good
[1393.30 → 1396.08] that the world has ever seen,
[1396.20 → 1397.78] salvation for all
[1397.78 → 1398.94] whom he will call.
[1399.16 → 1400.16] And if he can do that,
[1400.32 → 1401.32] is he not able
[1401.32 → 1403.18] to take your present situation
[1403.18 → 1404.56] of hurt and pain
[1404.56 → 1405.14] or worry,
[1405.44 → 1406.52] whatever it may be,
[1407.48 → 1409.04] and be present with you
[1409.04 → 1410.74] and turn it for his glory?
[1411.82 → 1412.28] Right?
[1412.30 → 1413.44] We may not know the details,
[1414.28 → 1415.66] but we have it even better
[1415.66 → 1417.02] because we know the God
[1417.02 → 1418.82] who controls the details.
[1419.08 → 1421.54] And still better yet,
[1422.68 → 1425.22] he knows us.
[1427.08 → 1427.64] Jesus,
[1428.02 → 1429.10] who lived the life
[1429.10 → 1429.84] I should have lived,
[1430.06 → 1431.20] who died the death
[1431.20 → 1432.28] that I deserve,
[1433.54 → 1434.78] gave himself up
[1434.78 → 1436.10] for me,
[1436.80 → 1438.70] for you.
[1439.98 → 1441.44] He knows you
[1441.44 → 1443.38] by name.
[1445.70 → 1448.32] That's remembering rightly.
[1449.78 → 1451.10] We have a responsibility
[1451.10 → 1452.34] to ourselves
[1452.34 → 1453.50] and to each other
[1453.50 → 1454.56] to do that,
[1454.80 → 1454.94] right?
[1454.98 → 1455.82] To put ourselves
[1455.82 → 1456.54] in places
[1456.54 → 1457.68] and circumstances
[1457.68 → 1458.90] and with a people
[1458.90 → 1460.38] who will help us
[1460.38 → 1461.72] remember rightly.
[1464.28 → 1465.34] Remembering rightly
[1465.34 → 1467.70] gets us to a place
[1467.70 → 1469.00] where we can view
[1469.00 → 1469.82] our lives,
[1469.82 → 1470.66] our present
[1470.66 → 1472.00] and future realities
[1472.00 → 1473.58] through the lens
[1473.58 → 1474.62] of what I'm calling
[1474.62 → 1476.60] valued virtues.
[1477.48 → 1478.38] That's part two.
[1479.34 → 1479.52] Right?
[1479.60 → 1480.50] Viewing our lives
[1480.50 → 1482.44] through valued virtues.
[1483.58 → 1484.68] Now this goes back
[1484.68 → 1485.72] to the second part
[1485.72 → 1487.00] of verse two.
[1487.46 → 1488.06] And so we said,
[1488.40 → 1488.58] Lord,
[1488.68 → 1489.68] I have heard of your fame.
[1489.78 → 1490.42] I stand in awe
[1490.42 → 1491.08] of your deeds,
[1491.16 → 1491.30] right?
[1491.34 → 1491.94] That's Habakkuk.
[1492.04 → 1493.08] I remember rightly
[1493.08 → 1494.12] what you have done
[1494.12 → 1495.18] and then now
[1495.18 → 1496.40] renew them
[1496.40 → 1497.42] in our day.
[1498.12 → 1498.92] In our time,
[1498.92 → 1499.80] make them known.
[1500.04 → 1500.76] In wrath,
[1500.92 → 1501.94] remember mercy.
[1502.48 → 1503.40] What's Habakkuk saying?
[1503.46 → 1503.68] He's saying,
[1503.88 → 1504.84] do it again, God.
[1505.60 → 1505.82] Right?
[1505.84 → 1506.44] If you've done it
[1506.44 → 1507.22] in the past,
[1507.42 → 1508.68] you can do it again
[1508.68 → 1509.42] in the present.
[1510.04 → 1510.90] That's hope.
[1512.58 → 1513.70] And Habakkuk knows
[1513.70 → 1514.72] that if he doesn't
[1514.72 → 1515.72] do it again
[1515.72 → 1516.40] in the present,
[1516.84 → 1517.70] he has a purpose.
[1518.98 → 1519.80] That's faith.
[1521.36 → 1522.18] And Habakkuk knows
[1522.18 → 1523.48] that in that purpose,
[1523.70 → 1524.92] he is never forgotten,
[1525.30 → 1526.48] he is never alone,
[1526.48 → 1527.82] and there are no mistakes.
[1528.64 → 1530.24] That's love.
[1531.74 → 1532.32] Hope,
[1533.36 → 1533.68] faith,
[1534.40 → 1535.20] and love.
[1536.02 → 1537.92] These are the three virtues
[1537.92 → 1539.30] by which we see
[1539.30 → 1540.14] life,
[1540.58 → 1541.14] and trial,
[1541.52 → 1542.10] and struggle,
[1542.48 → 1543.08] and hardship.
[1543.76 → 1543.92] Right?
[1544.02 → 1545.50] Hope that he can change it.
[1545.82 → 1546.66] Faith that in it
[1546.66 → 1547.58] he has a purpose,
[1547.78 → 1549.22] and love in such a way
[1549.22 → 1550.12] that he is always
[1550.12 → 1551.28] with you.
[1552.62 → 1553.70] Remembering rightly,
[1553.70 → 1555.22] or being part of a community
[1555.22 → 1556.62] that remembers rightly
[1556.62 → 1558.12] when you just can't,
[1558.36 → 1558.52] right,
[1558.62 → 1559.62] trains your heart
[1559.62 → 1561.36] to see the world
[1561.36 → 1562.20] and life
[1562.20 → 1563.84] through these virtues.
[1564.44 → 1565.12] And I know that
[1565.12 → 1567.00] the language of virtue
[1567.00 → 1567.60] and vice
[1567.60 → 1568.50] isn't really the way
[1568.50 → 1569.58] people talk anymore.
[1569.86 → 1570.74] I get that.
[1571.46 → 1572.08] But this
[1572.08 → 1573.84] isn't just
[1573.84 → 1574.68] talk.
[1574.92 → 1575.98] These aren't just
[1575.98 → 1576.70] words.
[1576.90 → 1577.90] This is God
[1577.90 → 1578.64] talking.
[1579.04 → 1580.04] These are God's
[1580.04 → 1580.62] words,
[1580.62 → 1581.20] and the one
[1581.20 → 1582.04] who spoke
[1582.04 → 1583.10] all the world
[1583.10 → 1584.12] into existence
[1584.12 → 1586.10] is speaking to you
[1586.10 → 1587.32] and to your heart
[1587.32 → 1588.82] right here.
[1589.62 → 1590.24] Now.
[1591.78 → 1593.38] He is drawing you
[1593.38 → 1595.26] into the arms
[1595.26 → 1596.68] of Jesus,
[1596.88 → 1598.72] close to his heart,
[1598.72 → 1600.46] and into your
[1600.46 → 1602.18] wrecked moments
[1602.18 → 1603.32] he whispers,
[1603.66 → 1605.64] I have made you,
[1605.86 → 1607.54] I will carry you,
[1607.54 → 1609.34] I will sustain you,
[1609.46 → 1611.22] and I will rescue you.
[1612.12 → 1613.28] Into your moments
[1613.28 → 1613.90] and days,
[1614.00 → 1615.08] whatever they are,
[1615.14 → 1615.52] he says,
[1615.62 → 1616.60] come to me,
[1616.72 → 1618.00] all who are weary
[1618.00 → 1619.18] and burdened,
[1619.20 → 1620.70] and I will give you
[1620.70 → 1621.52] rest.
[1623.28 → 1623.76] And look,
[1624.42 → 1625.78] this is our point.
[1626.82 → 1628.10] We are learning
[1628.10 → 1629.68] how to trust
[1629.68 → 1630.92] God's plan
[1630.92 → 1631.90] and purpose
[1631.90 → 1632.72] for establishing
[1632.72 → 1633.60] his kingdom
[1633.60 → 1634.66] and giving ourselves
[1634.66 → 1635.42] in trust
[1635.42 → 1636.36] with confidence
[1636.36 → 1637.38] and increasing
[1637.38 → 1638.34] our capacity
[1638.34 → 1639.12] for reverence
[1639.12 → 1639.54] and awe
[1639.54 → 1640.52] so that even
[1640.52 → 1641.66] when we are
[1641.66 → 1642.38] wrecked,
[1642.80 → 1644.28] we can worship.
[1646.22 → 1647.10] And that takes
[1647.10 → 1647.78] a changed heart.
[1649.82 → 1650.42] And look,
[1650.44 → 1651.06] I know that we're
[1651.06 → 1652.08] coming up against
[1652.08 → 1653.88] the limits of our time
[1653.88 → 1654.72] here this morning,
[1654.84 → 1655.60] and so I will be quick
[1655.60 → 1656.04] with this,
[1656.12 → 1658.32] but your story
[1658.32 → 1660.90] of a transformed heart,
[1661.34 → 1662.40] your story
[1662.40 → 1663.84] of God at work
[1663.84 → 1664.36] in you
[1664.36 → 1665.64] and through you
[1665.64 → 1667.68] is a powerful thing,
[1667.88 → 1669.08] and don't waste it
[1669.08 → 1670.20] by not telling it.
[1670.94 → 1671.06] Right?
[1671.18 → 1671.58] Parents,
[1671.76 → 1672.76] tell your kids
[1672.76 → 1674.04] how Jesus changed
[1674.04 → 1674.56] your life.
[1674.92 → 1675.20] Kids,
[1675.36 → 1676.14] tell your friends
[1676.14 → 1677.96] how Jesus is changing you.
[1678.30 → 1678.74] Boyfriends,
[1678.86 → 1679.76] talk to your girlfriends.
[1679.96 → 1680.36] Girlfriends,
[1680.46 → 1681.30] talk to your boyfriends
[1681.30 → 1682.58] about why faith
[1682.58 → 1683.94] in Jesus matters.
[1684.82 → 1685.02] Right?
[1685.14 → 1686.06] Find a chance.
[1686.46 → 1687.22] Make it happen.
[1687.22 → 1688.22] Talk to your neighbour
[1688.22 → 1688.82] this week
[1688.82 → 1689.86] about how God
[1689.86 → 1691.16] is changing your heart.
[1691.48 → 1692.44] Tell your coworkers
[1692.44 → 1693.34] why holding on
[1693.34 → 1693.78] to Jesus
[1693.78 → 1695.24] is so important.
[1695.46 → 1696.06] And don't make it
[1696.06 → 1696.68] more complicated
[1696.68 → 1697.74] than it needs to be.
[1697.94 → 1698.08] Right?
[1698.12 → 1698.80] Don't make it out
[1698.80 → 1699.66] to be more complicated
[1699.66 → 1700.76] than it actually is.
[1700.90 → 1701.10] Right?
[1701.14 → 1702.24] This is your story.
[1702.94 → 1704.22] The gospel of Jesus
[1704.22 → 1705.48] is your story.
[1706.28 → 1707.14] And so tell it.
[1710.02 → 1711.48] And if you can't tell it,
[1713.08 → 1714.36] or if you don't know
[1714.36 → 1715.32] your place
[1715.32 → 1716.26] in this story
[1716.26 → 1717.42] right now,
[1717.46 → 1718.46] or if you're in a place
[1718.46 → 1720.52] where you're just lost
[1720.52 → 1721.58] and afraid,
[1721.74 → 1722.68] I want to talk to you
[1722.68 → 1723.70] right now.
[1726.80 → 1728.16] If you are in a place
[1728.16 → 1730.76] that is so dark
[1730.76 → 1732.96] you can't see any light,
[1733.60 → 1735.22] if you are in a storm
[1735.22 → 1737.02] that is so overwhelming
[1737.02 → 1738.96] you can't even fix your eyes
[1738.96 → 1739.88] on anything
[1739.88 → 1740.78] or anyone,
[1741.10 → 1742.50] let alone Jesus,
[1742.64 → 1744.64] if you can't hold on anymore,
[1744.64 → 1746.20] I want you to know
[1746.20 → 1748.32] that he is holding on
[1748.32 → 1748.92] to you.
[1750.18 → 1751.82] That if you are faithless,
[1752.06 → 1753.14] he is faithful
[1753.14 → 1754.90] for he cannot disown himself.
[1755.24 → 1755.34] Right?
[1755.34 → 1756.18] That if you don't have
[1756.18 → 1756.82] the energy
[1756.82 → 1758.48] or the spiritual intuition
[1758.48 → 1759.90] to even look to Jesus
[1759.90 → 1761.56] as the waves are crashing in
[1761.56 → 1762.32] around you,
[1762.54 → 1764.62] know that he is reaching out
[1764.62 → 1765.32] to you.
[1765.62 → 1767.10] He is grabbing your hand.
[1767.48 → 1770.10] He will hold you fast.
[1770.10 → 1773.90] our circumstances
[1773.90 → 1774.80] may never change,
[1775.52 → 1778.00] but we will change
[1778.00 → 1780.56] because that's
[1780.56 → 1782.60] what God does.
[1783.74 → 1784.38] Amen.
[1784.88 → 1785.78] Let me pray with you.
[1785.78 → 1791.92] Lord God,
[1792.02 → 1792.44] today,
[1793.16 → 1795.06] take your word
[1795.06 → 1796.92] and transform us.
[1798.22 → 1799.68] Change our hearts,
[1800.08 → 1801.64] open our eyes
[1801.64 → 1802.64] that we might see
[1802.64 → 1803.94] Jesus.
[1806.14 → 1807.96] We might hear your voice
[1807.96 → 1810.64] whispering your promise.
[1810.64 → 1813.34] that we might hear your voice
[1813.34 → 1814.88] speaking love
[1814.88 → 1816.14] over us.
[1819.06 → 1820.04] Strengthen us
[1820.04 → 1820.90] in hope
[1820.90 → 1822.04] and faith
[1822.04 → 1823.26] and in love.
[1824.52 → 1825.26] And God,
[1825.30 → 1826.02] if we are hopeless,
[1826.92 → 1828.16] if we are faithless,
[1828.54 → 1829.90] if we don't know your love,
[1831.28 → 1832.10] reach out
[1832.10 → 1833.32] all the more.
[1834.68 → 1835.34] Hang on
[1835.34 → 1836.06] all the tighter.
[1837.20 → 1837.94] And may we
[1837.94 → 1838.64] experience today
[1838.64 → 1841.64] your strength.
[1843.44 → 1845.28] Hold us fast,
[1845.44 → 1846.00] Lord Jesus,
[1846.80 → 1848.42] that whatever may come,
[1849.58 → 1851.64] even while we are wrecked,
[1852.20 → 1854.68] we can worship you.
[1855.68 → 1856.32] Amen.
