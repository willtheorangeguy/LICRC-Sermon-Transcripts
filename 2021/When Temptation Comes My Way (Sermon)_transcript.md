[0.00 --> 9.26]  This morning, we're going to continue in our series on James, and we're going to read together
[9.26 --> 15.94]  from James 1. We're going to read verses 12 through 18. It will be on the screen as I go
[15.94 --> 20.58]  through it, but I do encourage you, if you have your own Bible or if you can open that up on your
[20.58 --> 25.26]  phone, whatever the case may be, just to have that with you as we go through the message today.
[25.26 --> 30.26]  From James 1, beginning at verse 12.
[55.26 --> 62.58]  Each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. Then, after desire
[62.58 --> 68.66]  has conceived, it gives birth to sin, and sin, when it is full grown, gives birth to death.
[69.82 --> 78.18]  Do not be deceived, my dear brothers. Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from
[78.18 --> 86.34]  the Father of heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows. He chose to give us birth
[86.34 --> 94.02]  through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of first fruits of all he created.
[94.82 --> 96.14]  This is the word of the Lord.
[96.14 --> 106.22]  There's a lot that I hope we can see together this morning, and so we're going to just jump right in
[106.22 --> 115.20]  to that. Now, in our passage this morning from James, there's a little shift that is taking place
[115.20 --> 123.00]  here, right? We're still under the larger umbrella of being hearers and doers, and this is still about
[123.00 --> 129.96]  how you make your faith real, but the shift that is taking place is from those things that happen
[129.96 --> 140.24]  to you to those things that happen in you. Now, remember, James has started his letter assuming or
[140.24 --> 146.94]  recalling the struggles that the early Christians faced, right? That the cultural effort to compromise
[146.94 --> 154.26]  in their life was strong. The external pressures to return to the old way of being was powerful,
[155.26 --> 164.18]  and these sorts of trials will be faced by anyone who wants to be a follower of Jesus. In fact, in James,
[164.42 --> 171.74]  it's presumed, right? To be a follower is to face fire, to stand in the furnace of oppression and
[171.74 --> 177.34]  ostracism for your faith. Facing these things, in fact, as we have seen and will continue to see,
[177.64 --> 186.48]  is a sign that your faith is real, and those external pressures exert a sort of force on you,
[187.48 --> 196.86]  right? The trial happens, and inside there is a temptation. That's James' point, right? He says in
[196.86 --> 202.22]  verse 12, blessed is the one who perseveres under trial, and then immediately in verse 13, he says,
[202.46 --> 210.92]  when tempted. Now, notice that, right? James says, when tempted. James' presumption is that you will be
[210.92 --> 216.84]  tempted, and he can presume that we will be tempted because he knows that real faith hearers and doers
[216.84 --> 228.16]  of the word will face trials, and trials come with an opportunity for temptation. Every trial brings
[228.16 --> 237.30]  temptation, right? Struggling with money, with not having enough money, is an opportunity for temptation
[237.30 --> 247.14]  temptation to question the providence of God in our life, right? The death of a loved one can tempt us to
[247.14 --> 256.40]  question God's love, right? Suffering in the world can tempt us to question God's goodness. Evil actions
[256.40 --> 266.52]  seemingly being rewarded tempt us to question God's justice. Testing brings temptation, and the deeper the trial,
[266.52 --> 274.28]  the more dangerous the temptation. As we get into this, I want to give sort of two things as kind of
[274.28 --> 279.32]  preliminary remarks that will sort of be a foundation out of which we can spring, and so first,
[280.78 --> 290.44]  temptation comes, but it is not God tempting you, right? God doesn't tempt you to sin, right? James writes,
[290.44 --> 296.24]  when tempted, no one should say, God is tempting me, for God cannot be tempted, nor does he
[296.24 --> 304.62]  tempt anyone, right? God might bring about a test of faith. He might allow a circumstance to happen. He
[304.62 --> 310.60]  might ordain a situation that is really hard for you to face alone, right? We see this all throughout
[310.60 --> 317.32]  the Bible, right? God testing Abraham in Genesis 22 is an example of this. The story of Job is an example
[317.32 --> 327.48]  of this, the story of Joseph, or of Jonah, or the book of Judges, right? And while God may test or prove his
[327.48 --> 338.30]  servants in order to show and strengthen their faith, God never, never seeks to make you sin or seeks to destroy
[338.30 --> 347.04]  your faith that is contrary to his nature and character and being in the world. The important
[347.04 --> 358.76]  distinction to see is the difference between an outer test and an inner temptation, right? An outer test
[358.76 --> 366.78]  is God wanting to hone your heart to stronger faith. Inner temptation is your heart hunting out in
[366.78 --> 375.00]  rebellion against God's design. That brings us to the second sort of preliminary remark. James writes,
[375.42 --> 382.16]  each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed. Then, after desire
[382.16 --> 390.92]  has conceived, it gives birth to sin, and sin, when it is full grown, gives birth to death. Temptation
[390.92 --> 400.88]  happens in the heart with desire. Sin happens when you follow up or do something with it. And get that,
[400.94 --> 409.74]  right? Temptation itself is not necessarily sinful, and that's important to hear, because sometimes I hear
[409.74 --> 417.40]  Christians talk about being bad Christians or being unsure if they really are Christian just because they
[417.40 --> 424.92]  continue to be tempted with something. And sure, over the course of your Christian life and maturation,
[424.92 --> 431.62]  as we are more and more transformed into the image of Jesus, we want to see, we should see, and we will see
[431.62 --> 439.50]  temptation lessen and the opportunity for temptation to lessen or its power over us to be minimized. But the fact
[439.50 --> 447.62]  of temptation is simply a part of the real faith experience, right? Even Jesus was tempted.
[450.02 --> 461.64]  And so listen carefully here. Faith, as hearers and doers of the word, is not indicated by the infrequency
[461.64 --> 473.44]  of temptation, but by the infrequency of giving in to temptation. Faith, as hearers and doers of the word, is not
[473.44 --> 484.74]  indicated by the infrequency of temptation, but by the infrequency of giving in to temptation. And so, with James,
[484.74 --> 492.88]  our goal here is to get better at not giving in to temptation, right, at not being deceived by the
[492.88 --> 499.90]  things that pull our hearts in all sorts of different directions. And that's where we're going to spend the
[499.90 --> 509.02]  rest of our time this morning, with tools for making faith real so that we can face temptation.
[509.02 --> 518.14]  Now, the first tool I want to share with you is what I'm calling the reframing of categories.
[519.56 --> 526.98]  Because here it is, right? When we think of sin and temptation, we generally start thinking in
[526.98 --> 536.66]  categories of what we can't do, right? We think in terms of limits to freedom or activity. We think
[536.66 --> 545.54]  how far is too far, or how much is too much, or when does this become wrong, right? We think more about
[545.54 --> 553.44]  boundaries and defining them clearly so that we know exactly how far we can go up to the line
[553.44 --> 563.32]  without crossing over it. I'll give you an example. A whole bag of chips is gluttony,
[563.32 --> 574.40]  so I'm only going to eat half. Taking the coins out of mom's wallet isn't the same as taking the bills
[574.40 --> 583.08]  out of mom's wallet, so I'm only going to take the coins. Four drinks gets me drunk, so I'll stop at
[583.08 --> 588.72]  three. Or I'll have three, and then I will eat, and then see how I feel about having that fourth.
[588.72 --> 596.66]  My girlfriend and I have been together for years. We should be allowed to do this. We love each other.
[598.72 --> 604.06]  It's not gossip if I don't use their names. I can't help it if people figure it out on their own.
[606.34 --> 611.70]  Right, we have all sorts of examples where we try to figure out exactly where that line is, and then we
[611.70 --> 618.56]  just take a step back from it. And in these examples, and really in all the examples that we could give
[618.56 --> 626.10]  and think of, if we think of sin and temptation in terms of what we can't do, the focus actually isn't
[626.10 --> 634.20]  on the right thing. The focus is on the wrong thing, right? It's on behavior. In some cases, the priority
[634.20 --> 639.54]  is actually finding ways to get away with just a little bit of something, if not the whole thing.
[639.54 --> 646.96]  When we think of sin and temptation as something we can't do or we shouldn't do, we are actually
[646.96 --> 654.56]  making the sin or the behavior or the activity or the focus the goal of our actions. But what if,
[655.44 --> 659.92]  and this is where I'm talking about that reframing, this is the paradigm shift that I would like us to
[659.92 --> 666.08]  lean into this morning. What if, and let's be honest, for some of us this paradigm shift is going to
[666.08 --> 670.00]  seem obvious as soon as I say it, and we're going to wonder, why didn't we think about this already?
[670.42 --> 678.38]  But what if, instead of focusing on what we can't do as sin, and I know that in your minds,
[678.52 --> 683.58]  some of you have already jumped to the idea that I'm going to say, what if we don't focus on what we
[683.58 --> 688.76]  can't do, but we focus on what we can do as obedience? And if that's where your mind went,
[688.76 --> 698.98]  you would be wrong. That's not what I'm going to say. That's not it. In fact, just changing the
[698.98 --> 706.12]  focus from what we can't do to what we can do isn't actually all that different. It still makes
[706.12 --> 714.14]  the behavior the focus. It still makes this all about morality. But here's the thing, and this may
[714.14 --> 725.32]  be controversial. Real faith isn't ultimately about your morality. How you behave in the world isn't
[725.32 --> 730.76]  ultimately what our faith is about, right? That's impacted. Don't get me wrong. Don't hear what I'm
[730.76 --> 736.80]  not saying. Of course, morality matters. But if you have made your religion, if you have made Christianity
[736.80 --> 743.18]  or your faith only about not doing some things and doing certain other things, you've missed the point
[743.18 --> 754.30]  of our faith. Listen carefully to this. God isn't interested in making you religious.
[755.92 --> 762.34]  Think about Jesus. Jesus was hated by the religious people of his day, and he called them hypocrites
[762.34 --> 772.00]  and a bunch of snakes. Religious people are hypocrites. And I could say that because I'm a hypocrite.
[773.18 --> 778.72]  And I could stand up here and tell you what to do and how to believe, not because I figured it all out,
[778.82 --> 782.48]  and from my perfection I'm shouting down from the mountaintops of my moral superiority.
[783.10 --> 789.36]  I could stand here and tell you, because I'm on that same journey with you. I'm in that mud and muck
[789.36 --> 796.70]  and mire of sin and temptation with you. What I have to say is only meaningful if it is the counsel of God,
[796.70 --> 799.04]  if it is his word and not mine.
[799.04 --> 810.28]  God isn't interested in making you religious. God isn't interested in making you spiritual.
[811.98 --> 818.44]  Now, being a spiritual person used to mean that being above the world and her problems, right,
[818.48 --> 825.68]  being aloof and disconnected. Today, being spiritual can mean being sort of transrational or even
[825.68 --> 831.58]  irrational in what we believe, but that's not what we want either. And sometimes in today's world,
[831.72 --> 838.84]  increasingly so, right, being spiritual means connecting to the sort of ethereal and nebulous
[838.84 --> 845.32]  powers of the world and bending them to our desires, right, or manifesting your realities.
[845.32 --> 851.74]  But that's not what we're talking about here either. God isn't interested in making you spiritual.
[853.66 --> 859.70]  God isn't interested in your self-care as an excuse to be self-absorbed, and this may be the
[859.70 --> 866.66]  primary idol of our therapeutic culture, but Jesus doesn't think of himself, right? Jesus sacrifices
[866.66 --> 874.66]  himself, and he calls you to do the same. And likewise here, God isn't interested in your serenity.
[875.32 --> 880.06]  Which can really, for most of us, just be a cover for apathy and indifference.
[881.62 --> 887.96]  Think about Jesus again, right? He is passionate for God, right? And God is jealous for his own
[887.96 --> 896.40]  glory. Jesus gets angry at sin, and he weeps for the city. There is a right crying out at injustice
[896.40 --> 903.32]  and a proper raging against the dying of the light, right? We do not go quietly into that good night.
[903.32 --> 910.42]  Instead, and here's the reframing for us that I was talking about, right? Here's that potential
[910.42 --> 917.94]  paradigm shift. Instead of thinking about what we can't do, instead of thinking about what we can do,
[918.28 --> 923.20]  real faith thinks about what it means to be holy.
[923.20 --> 936.60]  You see, God is interested in making you holy. And before you say that holy is the same thing as
[936.60 --> 941.78]  moral, hold on a minute, because it's not, right? That's what holiness has become in our sort of
[941.78 --> 946.64]  common language. It's mischaracterized that way, right? Especially when you think of the language of
[946.64 --> 950.28]  holier than thou. What does that mean, right? Well, it means they try to be a goody two-shoes,
[950.28 --> 956.70]  right? It means they're a little sanctimonious or pietistic. And sure, a part of holiness is
[956.70 --> 966.40]  righteousness, but holiness, first and foremost, is being set apart, right? God sets you apart.
[966.80 --> 974.02]  God calls you out of darkness into his wonderful light. God calls you out on a mission, right? God
[974.02 --> 983.04]  transplants you. God takes you out of death and gives you life. And God fills that life with a purpose.
[984.34 --> 993.68]  When we say that God is holy, the first thing that we mean, right, is that God is wholly other.
[993.68 --> 1004.52]  So when we say God is holy, H-O-L-L-Y, we mean he is wholly other, W-H-O-L-L-Y, right? He is transcendent.
[1004.76 --> 1010.96]  He is eternal, incomprehensible, invisible, unchangeable, infinite, almighty. He is totally
[1010.96 --> 1020.52]  set apart. He is other than all of creation. There is no one like him. That's holiness. And God calls you
[1020.52 --> 1031.60]  to the same. Set apart for a purpose. That's the paradigm shift to approach real faith from.
[1033.02 --> 1040.20]  And so instead of asking how far is too far, maybe ask what does it look like to be set apart
[1040.20 --> 1045.56]  from the world who doesn't know God in my relationship to my girlfriend or my boyfriend?
[1045.56 --> 1052.62]  Instead of asking how much is too much, ask what does it look like to have a purpose to glorify God
[1052.62 --> 1059.32]  with alcohol or food or whatever? Instead of asking what am I supposed to do in this moment,
[1059.62 --> 1065.98]  maybe wonder what does it look like to image Jesus here, right? If Jesus were living the life that I
[1065.98 --> 1071.66]  am living, doing the job that I am doing, parenting the kids that I am parenting, whatever the circumstance
[1071.66 --> 1080.04]  may be, how would he live it? Instead of focusing on the behavior that is wrong or even right,
[1080.52 --> 1085.46]  instead of focusing on the temptation or desire that gives birth to sin, we need to look at what
[1085.46 --> 1095.04]  it means to be holy. And look, I really love the way Tim Chester puts it in his book. The book is
[1095.04 --> 1101.18]  titled You Can Change. The subtitle of that book is really telling. The subtitle is God's Transforming
[1101.18 --> 1107.16]  Power for Your Sinful Behavior and Negative Emotions. And I reread that book in preparation for this
[1107.16 --> 1113.00]  message, and it was really impactful even the second or third time for me reading it. But he says, and I
[1113.00 --> 1124.20]  love this, the essence of holiness is not new behavior, activity, or disciplines. Holiness is new
[1124.20 --> 1134.20]  new affections, new desires, and new motives that then lead to new behavior. Holiness consists not in heroic
[1134.20 --> 1150.48]  acts, but in a thousand small decisions. Maybe you need to hear this this morning. You are holy.
[1150.48 --> 1163.16]  God has made you holy. Look, there's a beautiful couple verses in Hebrews 10 that talks about how
[1163.16 --> 1172.16]  Jesus' sacrifice is once for all, how the sacrifice in the temple and tabernacle before him were done
[1172.16 --> 1179.02]  in order to fill up the meaning of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross. What they were a shadow of, Jesus is the
[1179.02 --> 1186.90]  fulfillment of. The author of Hebrews writes in verse 10 of chapter 10, we have been made holy through the
[1186.90 --> 1196.40]  sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. Right? We have been made holy. We have been set apart
[1196.40 --> 1202.76]  and granted a righteousness that comes from God through faith in Jesus. And then in verse 14, same chapter,
[1202.76 --> 1210.64]  just a couple verses later, the author says, for by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who
[1210.64 --> 1224.78]  are being made holy. You are holy and you are being made holy. It's a both and relationship, an and both,
[1224.78 --> 1232.84]  right? That's faith made real. That's being hearers and doers. You are holy and you are being made
[1232.84 --> 1244.02]  holy and so in your life of faith together be holy. As you face temptation, be who you are. Live in the power
[1244.02 --> 1254.12]  of his new birth. James writes, he chose to give us birth through the word of truth that we might be a kind
[1254.12 --> 1264.84]  of first fruits for all he created. This is who you are born to be. Listen to these words from John Piper.
[1266.60 --> 1274.92]  Conversion is the creation of new desires, not just new duties. New delights, not just new deeds. New
[1274.92 --> 1282.70]  treasures, not just new tasks. Right? When you face temptation, and you will face temptation if you are
[1282.70 --> 1291.12]  generally a Christian, know that you are new. Your desires are new. Your delights are new. Your treasures
[1291.12 --> 1299.78]  are new. You have new love and you love newly. You are not a slave to sin. You are not a slave to old
[1299.78 --> 1305.30]  desires. You are not a slave to old nature. You are not a slave to the world or to the flesh. You are not
[1305.30 --> 1312.38]  a slave to alcohol or to drugs or to porn or to sex or to lust or stealing or gossip. You might still
[1312.38 --> 1318.04]  struggle with them. You might still struggle with all of them. But struggling with is different than
[1318.04 --> 1327.34]  being defined by. You are something new. That's the gospel of Jesus. You are holy.
[1329.98 --> 1333.30]  Again, I'm going to quote Tim Chester here. He says,
[1333.30 --> 1342.44]  I need more than an example. I need help. I need someone to change me. Right? Trying to imitate
[1342.44 --> 1348.76]  Jesus on its own leaves me feeling like a failure and I can't be like him. I can't match up. I need
[1348.76 --> 1354.98]  sorting out. I need rescuing. I need forgiveness. The great news is that Jesus is not only my example,
[1354.98 --> 1364.26]  but also my Redeemer. Because you see, there is a danger in a sermon like this. There is a danger
[1364.26 --> 1370.48]  in a sermon like this that says, you need to change your behavior and you need to try harder to be
[1370.48 --> 1379.08]  better at this. The reality is Jesus has done all the trying. Jesus has done all the better. Jesus has
[1379.08 --> 1387.22]  lived life perfectly in righteousness for you, obeying all the demands of God's law. And by grace through
[1387.22 --> 1399.04]  faith, he gives you his righteousness, gives you his obedience. And Jesus has died the death that we deserve.
[1399.04 --> 1413.66]  My sin was granted over and given over to him. Your sin was given and put on him. And he bore it on the cross
[1413.66 --> 1428.98]  for you and for me. And by his life and death and resurrection over sin and death, we have new life.
[1429.04 --> 1437.64]  That's the new reality for us. Not that we need to try harder, but that Jesus has accomplished it.
[1439.08 --> 1448.16]  Jesus has made you holy and he is making you holy. And so we get to live holy lives for him.
[1449.02 --> 1456.14]  That's the first tool here, right? Reframing the conversation around sin and temptation by the gospel,
[1456.14 --> 1463.12]  right? Moving it out of a category of behavior into an understanding of holiness. And this really
[1463.12 --> 1468.94]  isn't a tool so much as it's a new reality, one that we need to be reminded of in our lives over and over
[1468.94 --> 1478.26]  and over again. Live that new reality. The second tool is like it. We've already seen it. Maybe you caught
[1478.26 --> 1487.24]  it as we read it, but James wrote, he chose to give us birth through the word of truth.
[1488.34 --> 1498.10]  Look, over and over and over and over again in the Bible, this is true, right? God's word for you
[1498.10 --> 1504.88]  is the power of salvation for all who believe. Romans 10, where we've already heard from,
[1504.88 --> 1510.88]  says that the preached word is necessary for salvation. Romans 10, 17 says,
[1511.28 --> 1517.68]  faith comes from hearing the message and the message is heard through the word of Christ.
[1517.88 --> 1527.38]  The word of God is the means of regeneration. You are born by the word and the word of God is the means
[1527.38 --> 1536.76]  of your sanctification. You are set apart in life by application of and obedience to God's word.
[1538.68 --> 1545.88]  Think about it. Think about the power of God's word. Matthew 4, there's this really incredible story,
[1546.38 --> 1551.94]  right? Jesus goes out into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil himself.
[1551.94 --> 1559.26]  And when Jesus, the son of God incarnate, the word made flesh, the eternal son of the father who has
[1559.26 --> 1565.50]  existed in Trinitarian fellowship with him and the spirit forever, when this Jesus was tempted in his
[1565.50 --> 1573.28]  life by the devil, what did he do? Right? Jesus, who could have called down angel armies, Jesus,
[1573.42 --> 1577.48]  who could have expelled the devil from his presence, Jesus, who could have just walked away,
[1577.48 --> 1584.56]  Jesus quoted the Bible in the moments of his temptation, right? It was the Bible that pushes
[1584.56 --> 1591.54]  the devil back. Jesus says, it was written, man does not live on bread alone, but on every word
[1591.54 --> 1599.04]  that comes from the mouth of God. Get back, devil. It was also written, do not put the Lord your God to
[1599.04 --> 1606.86]  the test. Back off, demon. For it is written, worship the Lord your God and serve him only. Jesus is saying,
[1606.94 --> 1614.28]  you have no place here, Satan. The same is true for me and for you. The same is true for us. There is a
[1614.28 --> 1617.36]  power to God's word when we face temptation.
[1617.36 --> 1624.72]  But that power is most effective when you immerse yourself in it.
[1626.00 --> 1631.84]  You can't use the power of God's word in your struggles if you aren't in the pages of God's word
[1631.84 --> 1639.64]  on your best days. Right? When the language of the Bible just pours out of you as your own language,
[1639.64 --> 1647.94]  there is a power and an impact to those words. All Scripture is God-breathed, we read,
[1648.76 --> 1654.38]  and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness so that the servant
[1654.38 --> 1661.60]  of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. When you breathe and speak Scripture,
[1661.86 --> 1665.60]  it is like God breathing and speaking through you.
[1665.60 --> 1674.72]  And in the moment of our temptation, you better believe that matters. You better believe that makes
[1674.72 --> 1687.96]  difference. And then the third tool, and this one struck me more and afresh this week than it has
[1687.96 --> 1695.50]  previously. Notice what James writes, and pay attention here to the pronouns. He chose to give
[1695.50 --> 1709.42]  us birth, that we might be a kind of first fruits. Did you hear it? He chose us, that we, fruits,
[1709.90 --> 1718.96]  plural, right? These are collective plural pronouns. Community, church, body, brothers and sisters on the
[1718.96 --> 1729.62]  same journey of faith together. Are you getting it? Make it real, be hearers and doers, right? And making it real,
[1729.76 --> 1739.00]  and being hearers and doers happens together. Fighting temptation happens in community. Learning, hearing,
[1739.00 --> 1751.32]  applying the word happens in community. Many of you know this is the first Sunday of Lent, and Lent
[1751.32 --> 1758.34]  officially begins on Ash Wednesday. And this year for Ash Wednesday, we did things a little bit differently,
[1758.60 --> 1764.74]  but we still did the imposition of the ashes. And so when Pastor Kevin and I came to the church on
[1764.74 --> 1771.72]  Wednesday morning, we did the imposition of ashes for each other, so that when people came in to receive
[1771.72 --> 1778.36]  those ashes, we weren't marked in the same way. And so as Pastor Kevin marked my forehead, he said,
[1778.46 --> 1783.36]  for the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord. And then
[1783.36 --> 1789.38]  I had this black cross on my forehead for the rest of the day. There was a moment where I was in my study,
[1789.38 --> 1798.12]  I was working, thinking, writing, away, and without thinking, I just sort of put my hands on my face like
[1798.12 --> 1809.84]  this because I was processing. And then I looked at my hands, and they were black. And I thought,
[1809.84 --> 1821.72]  isn't that exactly how sin works? It stains me in an unconscious way. And the Ash Wednesday moment made
[1821.72 --> 1828.22]  that real for me in a way that had not yet been happening in my life. And so then I went and I
[1828.22 --> 1834.64]  washed my hands, and the sin went away. And I thought, isn't that exactly how grace works?
[1834.64 --> 1844.10]  An hour later, I walked by the mirror, and I saw that my cross was smudged.
[1845.28 --> 1849.56]  And I thought, oh, I can't do that. I'm going to have people showing up here in a few minutes,
[1849.74 --> 1853.88]  where I'm going to have to do the imposition of the ashes. And so I very carefully took one of the
[1853.88 --> 1858.22]  Lysol wipes, which we have plentiful around here because of our COVID policies, and I very carefully
[1858.22 --> 1867.44]  cleaned my smudge to look like a nice, good cross. And isn't that exactly what we do with our sins?
[1867.54 --> 1871.72]  We manicure them, and we present them to the world in a way that is socially acceptable.
[1872.78 --> 1873.84]  We hide the rest.
[1873.84 --> 1889.96]  And then, on that night between four and six, when some 25, 30 people came, we had a moment to be in
[1889.96 --> 1897.44]  community together and to recognize the reality of our sin, to stand together knowing that the wages
[1897.44 --> 1902.94]  of sin of death, but the gift of God is eternal life. And all of those reflections and struggles from
[1902.94 --> 1916.56]  the day before filled up that experience with you for me. When we face temptation and trials of sin,
[1916.78 --> 1929.40]  we do not face them alone. We are together as a body. We are together as a family, brothers and sisters.
[1929.40 --> 1936.24]  And so whatever it is that you are struggling with, however it is that you are manicuring your sin and
[1936.24 --> 1948.54]  temptation, you are not alone. Be with us. Join us on this journey of life and faith and of making it real.
[1948.54 --> 1958.20]  To be hearers and doers of the word is to face temptation. When we make our faith real, it will be hard.
[1959.06 --> 1967.98]  But God has equipped us through new birth and new identity as holy. So reframe the discussion of sin
[1967.98 --> 1977.50]  and temptation in the categories of what it means to be holy. God has given us his word to grant life and
[1977.50 --> 1987.50]  to power and has given us the power to defeat sin and temptation in life. And we are not alone.
[1987.50 --> 1999.52]  You are not alone. We live this real life faith together in community and that changes everything.
[2001.12 --> 2009.82]  It's my prayer that today you experience the grace of God in a way that is more real than you have in
[2009.82 --> 2017.28]  the last days or weeks or months or years. And maybe this is the first time, maybe this is the time
[2017.28 --> 2023.08]  innumerable of your experience of that grace, but if it is, would you bless God for it?
[2024.96 --> 2032.46]  Would you bless God for what he has done for you in Jesus? Amen. Let's pray together.
[2032.46 --> 2047.74]  Lord our God, we bless you. We bless you for our new identities. We bless you for making us holy and for
[2047.74 --> 2053.72]  the journey of being made holy. Lord, we need you.
[2053.72 --> 2064.62]  When temptation comes our way, we need you. And so speak truth in your word. Speak truth in your word
[2064.62 --> 2072.84]  through this community of faith. And may we together love and support one another so that as we go,
[2074.84 --> 2082.10]  as we face the battles of temptation, we might know the joys of new life in you.
[2083.72 --> 2095.26]  This is our prayer. Lord Jesus, be our blessing. In Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen.
