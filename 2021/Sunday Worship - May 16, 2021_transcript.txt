[1576.38 --> 1583.90]  fire that skipped in all directions and danced on the wind then what looked like tongues of fire
[1583.90 --> 1590.62]  settled on each person this was not a typical fire this was the holy spirit
[1590.62 --> 1597.82]  joy filled their hearts like it never had before it was a joyful love so powerful that they had to
[1597.82 --> 1605.18]  tell everyone jesus's holy spirit had come down from heaven hallelujah the christians shouted praise
[1605.18 --> 1612.06]  god on that very day people from all over the world were in jerusalem to celebrate pentecost
[1612.06 --> 1615.98]  when they heard that the disciples were loudly speaking their different languages
[1615.98 --> 1623.58]  people were shocked and came running to see what was going on aren't these uneducated men from galilee
[1623.58 --> 1629.82]  how can they speak all these different languages but some people made fun of them they said look at
[1629.82 --> 1635.18]  those crazy jesus followers they said what is wrong with them now kind of like what you just did to me hank
[1636.78 --> 1643.10]  but some realized that nothing was wrong everything was so right jesus lived in their hearts

[1657.10 --> 1663.82]  the prophets had to say jesus came to save us from sin evil men crucified him on a cross but god raised him
[1663.82 --> 1671.18]  from the dead they went up to heaven and now he sent us the holy spirit that is why you see us so filled
[1671.18 --> 1677.26]  with joy it's jesus love filling our hearts he has come to live in our hearts forever after the people
[1677.26 --> 1683.34]  heard this some of them wanted jesus in their hearts too what should we do to have jesus live in our hearts
[1683.34 --> 1690.46]  they asked repent and be baptized peter said yeah and you will be forgiven and receive the gift of the
[1690.46 --> 1698.46]  holy spirit on that day three thousand people believed in jesus as their savior and were baptized wow that is
[1698.46 --> 1704.38]  a big number three thousand that is a big number hooray said the disciples let's go and tell the
[1704.38 --> 1710.30]  whole world about jesus and that's what they did just like jesus told them to do and they started many
[1710.30 --> 1717.66]  churches that way isn't that quite the story hank that is incredible yeah and so that day was called
[1717.66 --> 1721.58]  pentecost and it's a day that we're celebrating this week i think actually next week sunday we're going
[1721.58 --> 1725.98]  to hear a sermon on pentecost um but we are doing in children's worship time this week because that's what the

[1975.26 --> 1980.22]  may be pleasing to you our lord our rock and our redeemer amen
[1987.50 --> 1994.62]  this morning in our worship together as we come to the word of god we're jumping back into the book of
[1994.62 --> 2003.50]  james we've got a couple more weeks in that book yet although next week as pastor kevin and hank
[2004.38 --> 2009.82]  helped us to see or maybe confused us some more in the midst of i don't know but next week is pentecost
[2009.82 --> 2017.34]  and so we will reflect on that in our time together there this morning however we're going to read
[2017.34 --> 2025.10]  from james 5 verse 1 through 6 and so i encourage you to grab a bible and have that in front of you as
[2025.10 --> 2034.14]  we read together and then as we reflect a little bit on god's wisdom for working so this is from james 5
[2034.14 --> 2044.14]  now listen you rich people weep and wail because of the misery that is coming on you your wealth has
[2044.14 --> 2051.18]  rotted and moths have eaten your clothes your gold and silver are corroded their corrosion will testify
[2051.18 --> 2059.18]  against you and eat your flesh like fire you have hoarded wealth in the last days look the wages you
[2059.18 --> 2065.98]  failed to pay the workers who mowed your fields are crying out against you the cries of the harvesters
[2065.98 --> 2073.66]  have reached the ears of the lord almighty you have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence
[2073.66 --> 2080.46]  you have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter you have condemned and murdered the innocent one
[2080.46 --> 2086.46]  who was not opposing you this is the word of the lord
[2089.18 --> 2096.30]  now it might surprise some of you and maybe just the the younger uh among those listening this
[2096.30 --> 2103.34]  morning that i haven't always been a pastor and in fact i had a few jobs before that god called me
[2103.34 --> 2109.26]  into ministry before i went into university to start that journey of answering god's call to ministry
[2111.74 --> 2119.10]  and in those jobs i had a number of really good experiences and a number of not so good experiences
[2119.10 --> 2124.94]  with co-workers with ideas around what it means to be a good worker but also what it means to be
[2125.50 --> 2131.66]  a good boss and so uh you know as a teenager i worked at mcdonald's and eventually i was a manager
[2131.66 --> 2137.98]  at the mcdonald's that i worked at so i both was a worker and in some cases a boss and tried to figure
[2137.98 --> 2144.94]  that out and what that was like i'll never forget i worked for a gentleman who i grew up with his kids
[2144.94 --> 2150.70]  in school and they owned a farm manufacturing business and i worked for them pushing a broom
[2150.70 --> 2156.30]  around the shop but learned how to do spot welding and painting and all sorts of fun stuff there and
[2156.30 --> 2161.66]  actually fred weaning in my mind will go down as one of the greatest people i have ever worked for as
[2161.66 --> 2167.02]  he was just a model of what i think and what i will hope we will see together of what it means to be a
[2167.02 --> 2174.14]  christian business person i've built houses for a number of years and then even while i was in
[2174.14 --> 2181.98]  university working towards my call into ministry i did that alongside of being in university
[2182.86 --> 2188.78]  to help pay for the costs of those sorts of things and built houses started with framing and then
[2188.78 --> 2194.70]  eventually got into more and more custom renovations and woodworking and then eventually some fine
[2195.42 --> 2201.18]  woodworking over that period as well and then as well nick vanderheide who i worked for i would hold
[2201.18 --> 2209.02]  up as an example of what it means to be a good christian boss but along the way there were some
[2209.02 --> 2215.90]  who professed to be christian but i wouldn't hold up as an example of what that is like and i'm trying
[2215.90 --> 2219.90]  to be very careful and charitable in my language there in case they happen to watch this because it's now
[2219.90 --> 2230.54]  forever recorded online for posterity's sake and so as we come into this text together i want us to be
[2231.82 --> 2241.74]  mindful of what james is doing and the the wisdom that he is calling us to as christians and and perhaps
[2241.74 --> 2251.74]  the uh the roundabout way that he gets us there because i think that as christian workers but
[2251.74 --> 2260.62]  especially as christian employers the bible's wisdom for working that james is sharing with us has a very
[2260.62 --> 2270.14]  specific hue to it a very specific direction and application for it and exploring that specific hue and
[2270.14 --> 2279.26]  direction for christians is my goal for us this morning now as you hear that i want to
[2281.10 --> 2285.74]  hear that specific focus i want you to hear that specific focus for this morning
[2285.74 --> 2293.18]  all right first i'm talking to christians right there are times when the words of scripture and when my
[2293.18 --> 2297.42]  preaching i stand up here i stand up here and they're words that are meant for all of humanity
[2298.46 --> 2302.94]  there are times when the words of scripture and the preaching that i do up here are meant for
[2303.50 --> 2309.02]  people exploring christianity or first coming to know jesus and there are times where
[2309.98 --> 2318.38]  there these words are just for us as christian people and then there are times probably the vast
[2318.38 --> 2326.22]  majority of times where it's a mix of all three of those things together but this morning my specific
[2326.86 --> 2333.98]  focus my specific audience the target of this message is people who identify as christians and
[2334.62 --> 2341.74]  more particularly christians who work right christians who work whether it's full-time or part-time or or
[2341.74 --> 2348.06]  volunteer it doesn't matter if you work if you call yourself a christian and you're listening this is for you
[2349.02 --> 2354.38]  now if you're a student whether in high school or university or college or trade school a journeyman or
[2354.38 --> 2361.18]  an apprentice if you are planning on entering the workforce someday in some way this is for you
[2362.22 --> 2370.70]  and then near the end is a sort of laser focus i want to talk to those of us who run businesses those of
[2370.70 --> 2378.30]  us who own businesses or manage people or are otherwise responsible for people and so if you are
[2378.30 --> 2384.94]  anywhere in this thing called a workforce even if you are officially retired because let's be honest
[2384.94 --> 2390.62]  we know that that's not really a construct that you can follow this is going to catch you up
[2392.22 --> 2398.54]  now that said if you're not yet a christian and you're listening this morning i don't want you to hear
[2398.54 --> 2403.82]  that as an excuse to stop listening and exploring what we're talking about instead i want to hold out
[2404.38 --> 2411.50]  this vision of labor this wisdom for working as something that that might be compelling to your
[2411.50 --> 2418.46]  heart's imagination i want to challenge you to to see in the bible's wisdom for working
[2419.74 --> 2428.54]  a true and better view of life and working than what you are currently hanging on to because maybe just
[2428.54 --> 2434.86]  maybe and i actually believe that this is the case that the design and intent of god for your work is
[2435.42 --> 2443.34]  better than whatever secular or western or individualistic or whatever story that you are
[2443.34 --> 2453.10]  holding on to right now in fact gathering us all up again i think that there is a precedent in our text for
[2453.10 --> 2459.66]  for doing exactly this for making this exact distinction between christian workers and those
[2459.66 --> 2467.42]  who don't believe the same as us and so with your bible look closely with me at this text
[2468.62 --> 2476.78]  verse one begins and says now listen you rich people weep and wail because of the misery that is
[2476.78 --> 2483.10]  coming on you right he begins this chapter james begins this chapter with a form of address he says
[2483.10 --> 2491.10]  now listen you rich people right james is talking to rich people but not just any rich people right
[2491.66 --> 2498.22]  again bible's open because we didn't read it but look at verse seven verse seven says be patient then
[2498.22 --> 2507.10]  brothers and sisters until the lord's coming or keep going back with me chapter 4 verse 11 brothers and
[2507.10 --> 2514.78]  sisters do not slander one another keep going back verse chapter 3 verse 10 and 12 my brothers and sisters
[2514.78 --> 2525.02]  this should not be my brothers and sisters can a fig tree bear olives or chapter 2 right you'll see there's a
[2525.02 --> 2530.46]  there's a recurring theme here in chapter 2 14 james says what good is it my brothers and sisters if
[2530.46 --> 2537.98]  someone claims to have faith but has no deeds chapter 1 same thing don't be deceived my dear brothers and
[2537.98 --> 2547.50]  sisters right you see what james does when james is addressing christians he calls them brothers and sisters he
[2547.50 --> 2554.94]  calls them fellow believers and then each time that he is talking to fellow believers about a sin or
[2554.94 --> 2561.42]  a wrong attitude or a wrong behavior he calls them to repentance he calls them and tells them to
[2561.42 --> 2567.18]  change to in the language of our series here to make their faith real by being hearers and doers
[2567.18 --> 2574.70]  of the word right we know that that james is writing to christians who are likely experiencing
[2574.70 --> 2580.46]  some sorts of hardship maybe even early forms of persecution we know that these christians are
[2580.46 --> 2588.22]  are being challenged to maintain their uniquely christian identity in the world but here in
[2588.22 --> 2596.30]  these six verses chapter 5 it's different right he doesn't call these people he is addressing and he
[2596.30 --> 2601.50]  uses the the formal grammatical construction of greek of an address so we know that he is addressing a
[2601.50 --> 2607.18]  certain type or group of people he doesn't call them brothers or sisters he doesn't call them to
[2607.18 --> 2614.54]  repentance in fact all we get in these verses is god's judgment and his doom on these rich people
[2615.90 --> 2625.90]  so what we know from that is that these are rich people who don't believe these are rich people who
[2626.54 --> 2635.26]  are oppressing the uh the the believing christians and the believing poor this these are rich people who are
[2635.26 --> 2643.66]  still under the wrath of god for sin right these are people uh for whom the second half of john 3 16
[2643.66 --> 2649.50]  applies right whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of
[2649.50 --> 2662.70]  god's one and only son james is talking to or about unbelieving rich and so if you're coming along this
[2662.70 --> 2670.86]  journey and you're wrestling with this text with me that begs a certain question for us right in a
[2670.86 --> 2678.14]  letter that is meant for christians why would james address the unbelieving rich that they're not likely
[2678.14 --> 2682.54]  to ever read it right they won't see it they won't find it they're not going to come across this letter
[2682.54 --> 2689.10]  in their life circumstances or situations why write such a devastating and to be frank and an eternally
[2689.10 --> 2697.66]  destructive message for them james is effectively saying the unbelieving rich will lose everything
[2697.66 --> 2702.78]  they treasure and they will be judged for their unbelief and the injustices committed in pursuit of
[2702.78 --> 2710.38]  their wealth now that's not an encouraging message for the unbelieving rich person but this letter isn't for
[2710.38 --> 2718.38]  them and that's james point right james is writing at this point in his letter just like an old testament prophet
[2718.38 --> 2725.50]  are the old testament prophets speaking and writing for israel and later judah regularly proclaim the
[2725.50 --> 2731.42]  doom of the pagan nations around them the old testament prophets regularly have a message of destruction
[2731.42 --> 2734.94]  for the unbelieving nations that surrounded israel and judah
[2737.58 --> 2745.98]  and so what was one of the biggest and most consistent challenges that the people of israel faced in their
[2745.98 --> 2751.58]  identity as the people of god right if you have the eyes to see it and you read through the old
[2751.58 --> 2755.66]  testament especially in the prophets you can see this over and over but also in the the beginning
[2755.66 --> 2761.58]  processes of judges and the kings right the the people wanted to be like the other nations right they
[2761.58 --> 2767.34]  wanted a king like the other nations and so they got saul they worshiped the gods of the other nations they
[2767.34 --> 2774.94]  wanted to live like the other nations and the prophets come along and they're pointing out the compromise of the people
[2774.94 --> 2781.42]  right the prophets are saying you want to be like the other nations this is what the lord has in store for
[2781.42 --> 2790.78]  those unbelieving people the same thing is happening here in james's letter to the churches there is a temptation
[2790.78 --> 2804.54]  to be like other people there is a temptation to want the wealth and the riches of others there is an idea here about life and the good life that roots it in wealth
[2804.54 --> 2812.78]  our hearts are tempted by the idea that stuff makes us happy and more stuff makes more happy
[2813.82 --> 2823.10]  and james like the old testament prophets before him is saying look at the way god sees their wealth and its
[2823.74 --> 2832.54]  attended injustices right is that really something you want to envy look at what god says is waiting for them
[2832.54 --> 2838.38]  is that really something you want to compromise your christian beliefs for and with
[2838.38 --> 2841.82]  because you see it's really easy to
[2841.82 --> 2845.82]  to look at the rich people in your life
[2845.82 --> 2847.02]  especially
[2847.02 --> 2850.02]  if you are struggling with poverty
[2850.02 --> 2853.98]  it's really easy to look at the rich people and to want what they have
[2853.98 --> 2861.18]  but the unbelieving rich have something coming that is worse than any blessed life they might find
[2861.18 --> 2869.58]  in this world and make no mistake about it right compared to the vast majority of the world most of us
[2869.58 --> 2872.62]  here and watching are counted among the rich
[2873.82 --> 2881.10]  in fact even in the more local closer to home view of canada or the fraser valley right most of us are
[2881.10 --> 2890.94]  counted as wealthy and the dominant story in our culture is that wealth equals success that riches
[2890.94 --> 2896.62]  make for the good life that you've got to have more stuff and get more stuff in order to feel like
[2896.62 --> 2903.34]  you've accomplished something or that after you've accomplished something your reward is rightly and properly
[2903.34 --> 2911.18]  more stuff and the deep truth is most of us don't even realize the comprehensive and deep ways that that story
[2911.18 --> 2913.42]  has shaped our understanding of the world
[2915.26 --> 2923.66]  and like i said i'm talking to the real faith christians this morning the hearers and doers and
[2923.66 --> 2929.90]  you might never actually say out loud riches make meaning right you might never actually say out loud
[2929.90 --> 2935.82]  uh in the words of duddy kravitz from the great canadian literature uh novel a man without land is
[2935.82 --> 2943.66]  nothing right you might never say out loud my job is my identity but in small and insidious and
[2943.66 --> 2947.98]  compounding ways you prove by your lifestyle that you do
[2951.74 --> 2958.14]  maybe you don't have a relationship with your kids today because you weren't around as they were
[2958.14 --> 2965.90]  growing up because you were at work and you tell yourself all sorts of things like i work so hard
[2965.90 --> 2972.22]  for my kids that's how i show my love for them but in truth in the language of religious affection
[2972.22 --> 2979.18]  right we've sacrificed our family on the career on the altar of career success because your kids
[2979.18 --> 2985.66]  don't care about your bank account they just don't right they want a hug they want to go for a bike ride
[2985.66 --> 2994.46]  they want a story at bedtime or maybe you don't feel close to anyone but in life you are surrounded
[2994.46 --> 3000.86]  with countless people maybe your story is that you've pursued career success so hard that you've
[3000.86 --> 3007.18]  actively pushed people away because they didn't get you closer to your goals right you had no use for
[3007.18 --> 3013.50]  them as the saying goes and maybe you've just passively put it out there that that getting to the top 40
[3013.50 --> 3020.38]  under 40 list or top 60 under 60 or whatever age you are right is that's what matters to you and that
[3020.38 --> 3025.26]  people are just going to get out of the way in order for that to happen and so now in your life your
[3025.26 --> 3029.66]  only friend is the uber eats driver who comes four times a week to bring you dinner and maybe the
[3029.66 --> 3035.02]  bartender that you happen to talk to as you find moments of excuse right in the language of religious
[3035.02 --> 3042.46]  affection again you've pushed people away to receive the sacrament of status but now there's no one
[3042.46 --> 3054.46]  left to genuinely share that with look john calvin in in commenting on this text from james that we are
[3054.46 --> 3063.18]  looking at says this he says james has a regard to the faithful that they hearing the miserable end of
[3063.18 --> 3075.50]  the rich might not envy their fortune but it's so easy in our world to envy the fortunes the rich we want
[3075.50 --> 3083.90]  what they have we aspire to be like them and sometimes we become bitter when we can't or when we don't have
[3083.90 --> 3087.18]  what they have instead
[3087.18 --> 3095.66]  what if we didn't look to the wealth of the unbelieving rich for inspiration and motivation
[3096.54 --> 3102.78]  what if we looked to the to the faith of the saints for inspiration and motivation and just like the the
[3102.78 --> 3109.18]  old testament prophets before him james is inviting you to share in a true and better story of right belief
[3109.18 --> 3117.26]  james is saying look jesus is the hero of this story jesus is the gospel the good news the only really
[3117.26 --> 3123.34]  good news in all the world right the life that he lived he lived for you the death that he died he died
[3123.34 --> 3133.18]  to save you his death brings you life and jesus himself said he brings you an abundant life and not of wealth or
[3133.18 --> 3139.02]  status or power or at least not necessarily in fact quite explicitly right he says that you might have to give
[3139.02 --> 3147.26]  all that up but it is an abundant life in purpose it is abundant life in the the lavish love of the
[3147.26 --> 3154.94]  father washing down over you it is abundant in reflecting the glory of god you are being transformed
[3154.94 --> 3161.90]  the scriptures say from one degree of glory to another you are being saved and sanctified for a life
[3161.90 --> 3168.86]  of faith of faith and faithfulness and that life that life is the one that you were created for
[3171.26 --> 3180.86]  that life is the life of joy and meaning and purpose that is the life that says in riches and in poverty
[3180.86 --> 3191.50]  it is well with my soul that's gospel identity for the christian that's gospel purpose for our lives
[3191.50 --> 3197.58]  together and it is an altogether different story than the world is telling or the world would have
[3197.58 --> 3206.94]  you believe and that's the contrast that james wants us to see this morning so he pronounces the judgment
[3206.94 --> 3214.86]  of god on the unbelieving rich in these verses and he is also by contrast then showing us a biblical
[3214.86 --> 3224.54]  wisdom for riches and for working and for wealth and the contrast then becomes our point of inference
[3224.54 --> 3233.26]  from which we can discern biblical principles for our actions in the world and so by way of application
[3233.98 --> 3241.82]  let's take the contrast james is making and turn it into biblical principles for our working wisdom or our
[3241.82 --> 3248.78]  wisdom for working here's what we will then see the unbelieving rich are judged for their stockpiling
[3248.78 --> 3254.86]  their squandering and their selling out to selfishness right they're stockpiling they're squandering and
[3254.86 --> 3262.30]  they're selling out to selfishness and so christians that is living a hearer and doer faith made real christians
[3262.30 --> 3273.18]  will be generous and stewardly and charitable stockpiling your wealth has rotted and moths have eaten your clothes
[3273.18 --> 3278.78]  your gold and silver are corroded their corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire
[3278.78 --> 3288.70]  you have hoarded wealth in the last days james is saying that this sort of extreme stockpiling has no
[3288.70 --> 3296.30]  purpose except for pride but it is a way of of looking at your kingdom of surveying your possessions and
[3296.30 --> 3305.82]  saying look what i have done in contrast christians must recognize that what we have is a gift from god that
[3305.82 --> 3315.82]  every good and perfect gift comes from above and as a gift from god it must properly be used for god
[3315.82 --> 3327.58]  and god gives his gifts for the aid and help of human life god gives his good gifts for the the edification
[3327.58 --> 3331.66]  the gathering up and the drawing to glory of the church
[3335.34 --> 3344.46]  they are given in order to give freely you have received and so freely you shall give second corinthians 9 is
[3344.46 --> 3352.30]  is all about how generosity is the pattern of giving for the christian church and let me be clear okay
[3352.30 --> 3357.26]  abundantly clear because sometimes we'd like to make our own rules around this sort of thing i'm not
[3357.26 --> 3364.46]  putting a number on generosity i'm not talking about 10 or 50 or 100 there are examples in scripture of all
[3364.46 --> 3370.86]  of those numbers the new testament doesn't put a number on it for us but what jesus and the whole new
[3370.86 --> 3378.54]  testament after him does do is confirm that we must be generous right the the rule if you must have one
[3378.54 --> 3381.74]  for our giving as christians is generosity
[3384.62 --> 3392.14]  and also note that the the role of community the role of the church can't be understated here
[3393.18 --> 3399.50]  right it is the western story that ties our wealth and our experience of wealth to individualism
[3399.50 --> 3406.54]  and to individual effort the church is a community right and so some will give more to the church
[3406.54 --> 3413.50]  some will receive more from the church and blessed be the name of the lord that's all that matters
[3413.50 --> 3421.02]  instead of stockpiling let's be generous together instead of telling the story that will end in
[3421.02 --> 3427.58]  judgment let's tell the story of generosity that reveals the grace god
[3429.50 --> 3434.70]  the unbelieving rich are judged for their squandering look at verse five you have lived on earth in
[3434.70 --> 3442.30]  luxury and self-indulgence you have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter now this
[3442.94 --> 3452.06]  squandering is in excess and extravagance right this is making yourself plump with the success and status and
[3452.06 --> 3460.30]  position in society only to find out that in the end all the unbelieving end up the same the reward is
[3460.30 --> 3470.78]  fleeting in this life but the judgment is forever instead as christians we are called to a responsibility of
[3471.34 --> 3478.14]  stewardship right and to steward something is to care for it even if it doesn't belong to you
[3478.14 --> 3487.98]  right be a be a steward of god's gifts and and like god use them lavishly right steward them wisely and
[3487.98 --> 3498.54]  and spread them out liberally and look let me be clear here right the the problem that james isn't addressing
[3498.54 --> 3506.06]  isn't the fact of being rich or the fact of being wealthy the problem isn't wealth the problem is what we
[3506.06 --> 3511.98]  do with it the problem is the meaning we make for ourselves in the midst of having it and so as
[3511.98 --> 3519.02]  those of us here who are wealthy by relative standards and by international standards abundantly so
[3519.02 --> 3530.54]  as those of us who are rich it matters what we do with our wealth that matters how we steward what god
[3530.54 --> 3538.54]  has given us because that is a very reflection on what we know from god on what we have received
[3538.54 --> 3545.58]  from him on what we believe to be our purposes in the world as his disciples
[3548.30 --> 3556.86]  finally the unbelieving rich are judged for their selling out to selfishness verse 4 says look the wages
[3556.86 --> 3562.30]  you have failed to pay the workers who mowed your fields are crying out against you the cries of the
[3562.30 --> 3571.26]  harvesters have reached the ears of the lord almighty now when i say that james writes this to expose
[3571.26 --> 3577.74]  those who sell out to selfishness what i mean by that is those who have put themselves first
[3577.74 --> 3586.94]  over and sometimes against those who work for them right this is really a testimony of justice or injustice
[3588.14 --> 3601.58]  now this is the one this one is for those who pay wages right what you pay your employees is a testimony of justice or a testimony of injustice
[3601.58 --> 3610.86]  right the unbelieving rich that james is exposing were sellouts to selfishness and though we as christians need to do something better
[3612.54 --> 3615.18]  and let me be really really clear again here okay
[3615.90 --> 3623.82]  i'm not trying to make a political comment about a living wage i'm not trying to enter into that discussion about a minimum wage and what it should be and who it should apply to
[3624.14 --> 3631.02]  i don't even want to have that conversation right here and now even though i have very strong opinions on it about how far the government should exercise its authority in making those decisions
[3631.02 --> 3642.62]  decisions on behalf of society i'm talking to you as christian citizens as individual believers i'm talking to us as a church of jesus christ
[3644.30 --> 3648.62]  specifically i'm talking to you christian employers
[3650.46 --> 3659.02]  christian business owners ceos and cfos managers people who are in charge of other people what you decide to pay
[3659.02 --> 3669.18]  your people is a testimony of justice or it's a story of injustice and as christians you are called to a higher
[3669.74 --> 3677.58]  standard your wage programs should be something that your employees will boast about your employees should
[3677.58 --> 3686.70]  tell stories of your generosity you should be the ceo of charity that's the the the name of the second title of the sermon you might see it on the screen there
[3686.70 --> 3693.50]  right the ceo of c that's what it should be for you ceo of charity chief executive officer of charity that's
[3693.50 --> 3701.02]  who you should be as a christian business person would it be that christian bosses had that reputation
[3701.02 --> 3704.70]  would it be that there were more fred weenings and nick van der heides in our world today
[3706.70 --> 3713.26]  let me be frank again i'm being cautious as i enter into the discussion our churches should be the same
[3713.26 --> 3719.58]  right churches are employers too and again let me be clear don't hear what i'm not saying i'm not
[3719.58 --> 3724.78]  advocating for a raise for myself right i really believe that you all pay me really really well and
[3724.78 --> 3729.98]  generously and i am so grateful for that and i will boast in the lord about your generosity towards me
[3730.86 --> 3736.14]  but more than just wages and more than just for me as lead pastor but for all the staff for all the
[3736.14 --> 3742.14]  volunteers and the people who lead here i really believe that the church needs to be an example of what
[3742.14 --> 3749.26]  the wisdom for working looks like in this we need to take care of our people in the church and in
[3749.26 --> 3756.14]  your businesses in salary we should be generous in flexibility and understanding we should be liberal and
[3756.14 --> 3767.10]  in caring and support we should be lavish we need to be paradigmatic examples in all of this together
[3767.10 --> 3776.70]  instead of selling out to selfishness we ought to be charitable with our wealth and our wages the ceo
[3777.34 --> 3788.62]  of c that's our title in a world that stockpiles for prideful gain tell a better story by being generous
[3788.62 --> 3796.14]  with your resources in a world that that squanders riches on missed place religious affections tell a
[3796.14 --> 3802.62]  better story by being stewardly and gracious and in a world that has sold out to selfishness tell a
[3802.62 --> 3813.34]  better story of charity and justice tell that story with your life and you will be telling the gospel it is
[3813.34 --> 3820.38]  our job to tell the gospel amen amen amen let's pray
[3825.90 --> 3835.34]  lord god make us the kinds of people who reflect your love make us the kinds of people who tasting and
[3835.34 --> 3841.18]  are good and seeing your goodness to us are good to all those around us and as we think about what it
[3841.18 --> 3848.94]  means to be a christian worker as we think about what it means to be a christian boss may we specifically
[3849.82 --> 3855.42]  reveal your grace may we be generous
[3855.42 --> 3868.54]  may we be stewardly may we be charitable may our lives tell the story of your work in the world
[3870.86 --> 3875.66]  and in doing so lord god may we reveal your kingdom come and your kingdom coming
[3875.66 --> 3881.66]  we know that our labors in the lord are not in vain
[3883.90 --> 3891.10]  we know that the harvest is plentiful and the workers are few so make us workers for your kingdom
[3891.74 --> 3903.66]  in jesus name we pray amen
[3905.66 --> 3910.06]  take my life
[3910.06 --> 3917.50]  and let it be consecrated lord to thee
[3918.06 --> 3922.78]  take my moments and my days
[3922.78 --> 3927.90]  let them flow in endless praise
[3927.90 --> 3931.90]  let them flow in endless praise
[3931.90 --> 3938.30]  take my hands and let them move
[3938.30 --> 3942.30]  and the impulse of thy love
[3942.30 --> 3946.30]  take my feet and let them be
[3946.30 --> 3950.78]  and let them build
[3950.78 --> 3953.74]  and be
[3956.14 --> 3958.54]  swift and beautiful for thee
[3958.54 --> 3964.92]  Take my voice and let me sing
[3964.92 --> 3969.78]  Always only for my King
[3969.78 --> 3975.10]  Take my lips and let them be
[3975.10 --> 3980.10]  Filled with messages from Thee
[3980.10 --> 3985.78]  Filled with messages from Thee
[3985.78 --> 3991.56]  Take my silver and my gold
[3991.56 --> 3996.38]  Not a mite would I withhold
[3996.38 --> 4002.08]  Take my intellect and use
[4002.08 --> 4007.32]  Every power as Thou shalt choose
[4007.32 --> 4012.66]  Every power as Thou shalt choose
[4012.66 --> 4018.44]  Take my will and make it Thine
[4018.44 --> 4023.44]  It shall be no longer mine
[4023.44 --> 4029.54]  Take my heart, it is Thy own
[4029.54 --> 4034.32]  It shall be Thy royal throne
[4034.32 --> 4040.10]  It shall be Thy royal throne
[4040.10 --> 4046.20]  Take my love, my Lord, I pour
[4046.20 --> 4051.44]  At Thy Phoenix treasure store
[4051.44 --> 4056.10]  Take myself and I will be
[4056.10 --> 4062.08]  Ever only all for Thee
[4062.08 --> 4068.88]  Ever only all for Thee
