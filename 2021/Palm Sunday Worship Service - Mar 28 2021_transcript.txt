[0.00 --> 2.96]  Yeah
[30.00 --> 54.44]  This is my worship. This is my offering. In every moment, I withhold nothing. I'm learning to trust you, even when I can't see it.
[54.44 --> 61.88]  And even in suffering, I have to believe it.
[63.68 --> 75.82]  If you say it's wrong, then I'll say no. If you say release, I'm letting go. If you're in here with me, I'll begin.
[75.82 --> 87.82]  And when you say to jump, I'm diving in. If you say be still, then I will wait. If you say to trust, I will obey.
[87.82 --> 98.82]  I don't want to follow my own way. I'm done chasing feelings. Spirit, leave me.
[98.82 --> 104.82]  Spirit.
[104.82 --> 105.82]  Spirit.
[105.82 --> 107.82]  Spirit.
[107.82 --> 108.82]  Spirit.
[108.82 --> 109.82]  Spirit.
[109.82 --> 110.82]  Light.
[110.82 --> 111.82]  Light.
[111.82 --> 114.60]  It felt like a burden.
[114.60 --> 116.22]  of what could grasp it.
[116.22 --> 121.88]  You took me further, further than I was asking.
[121.88 --> 127.76]  Simply to see you, you took me further, further than I was asking.
[127.76 --> 131.76]  Simply to see you
[131.76 --> 136.04]  You're good enough
[136.04 --> 139.80]  My life is an altar
[139.80 --> 143.76]  And your fire falls
[143.76 --> 149.62]  If you say it's warm then I'll say no
[149.62 --> 153.86]  If you say release I'm letting go
[153.86 --> 157.80]  If you're in it with me I'll be gay
[157.80 --> 161.92]  And when you say to jump I'm diving in
[161.92 --> 166.16]  If you say you're still then I will wait
[166.16 --> 170.22]  If you say to trust I will obey
[170.22 --> 174.24]  Teach me how to follow in your way
[174.24 --> 177.08]  I'm done chasing feelings
[177.08 --> 181.70]  Spirit need me
[183.86 --> 189.86]  Spirit need me
[189.86 --> 197.86]  Spirit need me
[197.86 --> 205.86]  Spirit need me
[205.86 --> 207.86]  Spirit need me
[207.86 --> 213.86]  Spirit need me
[213.86 --> 217.86]  When all hope is yours
[217.86 --> 221.86]  And your word is all I've got
[221.86 --> 225.86]  I have to believe
[225.86 --> 229.86]  You still bring water from the rise
[229.86 --> 233.86]  To satisfy my thirst
[233.86 --> 237.86]  To love me at my grace
[237.86 --> 241.86]  And even when I don't remember
[241.86 --> 245.86]  You remind me of my worth
[245.86 --> 251.86]  I don't trust my ways
[251.86 --> 255.86]  I'm trading in my thoughts
[255.86 --> 259.86]  I lay down everything
[259.86 --> 263.86]  Cause you're all that I want
[263.86 --> 265.86]  I've landed on my knees
[265.86 --> 267.86]  I've landed on my knees
[267.86 --> 269.86]  This is the cup you have
[269.86 --> 271.86]  For me
[271.86 --> 275.86]  And even when it don't make sense
[275.86 --> 277.86]  I'm gonna let you
[277.86 --> 279.86]  Spirit need me
[279.86 --> 281.86]  Spirit
[281.86 --> 283.86]  Yeah
[283.86 --> 285.86]  I'm gonna let you
[285.86 --> 287.86]  Spirit lead
[287.86 --> 289.86]  Spirit
[289.86 --> 295.52]  I'm gonna let your spirit lead
[295.52 --> 303.76]  I'm gonna let your spirit lead
[303.76 --> 308.62]  Come on, sing it out
[308.62 --> 311.96]  Let your spirit lead
[311.96 --> 319.84]  I'm gonna let your spirit lead
[319.86 --> 329.16]  I'm gonna let your spirit lead
[329.16 --> 336.46]  I'm gonna let your spirit lead

[409.34 --> 417.64]  Sing it
[417.64 --> 418.64]  Can you hear it?
[418.64 --> 419.64]  The sound of heaven
[419.64 --> 427.94]  The sound of heaven
[427.94 --> 429.94]  Touching us
[429.94 --> 438.24]  King Jesus
[438.24 --> 440.24]  You're the name
[440.24 --> 448.54]  Shaking up
[448.54 --> 450.54]  We're the sound of heaven
[450.54 --> 452.54]  We're the sound of heaven
[452.54 --> 460.84]  We're the sound of heaven
[460.84 --> 462.84]  We're the sound of heaven
[462.84 --> 474.84]  We're the sound of heaven

[624.48 --> 633.12]  Hosanna, Hosanna.

[656.88 --> 659.02]  We turn to you.
[659.02 --> 664.38]  Good morning.
[664.62 --> 668.92]  It is so wonderful to see those of you that are here in the building with us this morning.
[669.06 --> 671.24]  And we welcome all of you at home as well.
[671.72 --> 674.76]  We ask you to stand now for our call to worship.
[674.76 --> 690.62]  When God appeared on earth in the person of Jesus, most of the world did not recognize him and therefore did not worship him.
[691.14 --> 700.82]  Today we ask for faith that will open our eyes to see Jesus for who he is, that we might worship him in truth.
[700.82 --> 709.02]  We open our eyes to see his glory.
[709.66 --> 712.66]  We open our ears to hear his wisdom.

[717.30 --> 719.94]  We open our mouths to sing his praises.
[720.90 --> 724.40]  We open our hearts to offer him our love.
[725.20 --> 726.36]  He is Lord.
[726.36 --> 732.00]  Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord.
[734.20 --> 737.16]  In heaven and glory in the highest.
[738.68 --> 739.36]  Hosanna.
[740.58 --> 742.12]  Hosanna in the highest.
[743.00 --> 744.86]  Hosanna in the highest heaven.
[746.00 --> 746.72]  Hosanna.
[747.20 --> 749.42]  You are the God who saves.
[750.74 --> 751.46]  Hosanna.
[751.84 --> 754.60]  We welcome you here, Lord Jesus.
[754.60 --> 755.16]  Hosanna.
[755.16 --> 756.04]  Hosanna.

[818.12 --> 822.30]  in your presence
[822.30 --> 824.58]  all our fears
[824.58 --> 826.72]  are washed away
[826.72 --> 828.72]  washed away
[828.72 --> 830.72]  washed away
[830.72 --> 833.72]  Hosanna
[834.94 --> 837.72]  Hosanna
[837.72 --> 838.88]  Hosanna
[838.88 --> 841.74]  you are the God
[841.74 --> 843.28]  who saves us
[843.28 --> 845.28]  worthy of all
[845.28 --> 847.28]  our praises
[847.28 --> 849.28]  Hosanna

[858.80 --> 860.82]  among us

[873.68 --> 877.68]  returning to you
[877.68 --> 881.68]  we turn to you

[883.68 --> 888.08]  in your kingdom
[888.08 --> 889.36]  in your kingdom
[889.36 --> 891.52]  broken
[891.52 --> 895.02]  lives are made new

[899.58 --> 903.98]  cause when we see you

[1098.90 --> 1099.90]  as we gather
[1099.90 --> 1100.70]  on Palm Sunday
[1100.70 --> 1101.28]  we gather
[1101.28 --> 1102.68]  to sing praises
[1102.68 --> 1103.64]  to our King
[1103.64 --> 1104.70]  because Jesus
[1104.70 --> 1105.94]  is here
[1105.94 --> 1107.68]  he welcomes us
[1107.68 --> 1108.94]  into this place
[1108.94 --> 1109.84]  he welcomes you
[1109.84 --> 1110.58]  at your homes
[1110.58 --> 1111.54]  and around your tables
[1111.54 --> 1112.44]  as you come
[1112.44 --> 1113.28]  into his presence
[1113.28 --> 1113.70]  and so
[1113.70 --> 1115.02]  hold out your hands
[1115.02 --> 1115.90]  open up your heart
[1115.90 --> 1117.04]  receive the greeting
[1117.04 --> 1118.24]  of our God
[1118.24 --> 1118.64]  and King
[1118.64 --> 1121.18]  grace
[1121.18 --> 1122.68]  mercy
[1122.68 --> 1124.30]  peace to you
[1124.30 --> 1125.44]  from God
[1125.44 --> 1125.98]  our Father
[1125.98 --> 1127.34]  Jesus Christ
[1127.34 --> 1127.92]  his Son
[1127.92 --> 1128.82]  our Savior
[1128.82 --> 1129.40]  and King
[1129.40 --> 1130.46]  through the presence
[1130.46 --> 1131.00]  and power
[1131.00 --> 1132.32]  of the Holy Spirit
[1132.32 --> 1133.92]  Amen
[1133.92 --> 1135.18]  let's continue
[1135.18 --> 1136.16]  worshiping God together
[1136.16 --> 1143.28]  please join us
[1143.28 --> 1144.10]  in this prayer
[1144.10 --> 1145.26]  of Palm Sunday
[1145.26 --> 1145.92]  confession
[1145.92 --> 1149.38]  blessed are you
[1149.38 --> 1150.42]  holy God
[1150.42 --> 1152.34]  for in Jesus Christ
[1152.34 --> 1153.88]  you came to rule
[1153.88 --> 1154.78]  in our lives
[1154.78 --> 1156.84]  not as a king
[1156.84 --> 1159.16]  but as a humble servant
[1159.16 --> 1160.52]  riding on a donkey
[1160.52 --> 1162.50]  help us
[1162.50 --> 1163.62]  be a people
[1163.62 --> 1164.76]  of humility
[1164.76 --> 1167.64]  help us
[1167.64 --> 1168.78]  be a people
[1168.78 --> 1169.76]  of repentance
[1169.76 --> 1172.68]  help us
[1172.68 --> 1173.44]  be a people
[1173.44 --> 1174.94]  of thankfulness
[1174.94 --> 1177.84]  enter into our hearts
[1177.84 --> 1178.48]  this day
[1178.48 --> 1179.36]  with glory
[1179.36 --> 1181.40]  that we may greet
[1181.40 --> 1182.26]  you with shouts
[1182.26 --> 1183.02]  of praise
[1183.02 --> 1184.34]  no matter
[1184.34 --> 1185.74]  what our circumstance
[1185.74 --> 1187.74]  through Christ
[1187.74 --> 1188.68]  our Savior
[1188.68 --> 1189.86]  Amen
[1189.86 --> 1203.22]  love us
[1203.22 --> 1216.22]  piano plays softly
[1216.22 --> 1223.70]  Father, into your courts I will enter
[1223.70 --> 1229.30]  Maker of heaven and earth
[1229.30 --> 1237.32]  I tremble in your holy presence
[1237.32 --> 1244.00]  Glory, glory in your sanctuary
[1244.00 --> 1249.06]  Splendor and majesty, Lord
[1249.06 --> 1257.16]  Before you, a life adores you
[1257.16 --> 1261.18]  All the earth will declare
[1261.18 --> 1266.68]  That your love is everywhere
[1266.68 --> 1272.18]  The fields will exalt
[1272.18 --> 1275.18]  Fields resound
[1275.18 --> 1282.16]  Hear the trees joyful cry
[1282.16 --> 1288.18]  Praising you and so will I
[1288.18 --> 1293.34]  On whose song I sing
[1293.34 --> 1296.18]  Lord, I will glorify
[1296.18 --> 1301.18]  And bless your holy name
[1301.18 --> 1316.88]  Jesus, Lord of all life and salvation
[1316.88 --> 1321.62]  Into your presence we come
[1321.62 --> 1330.64]  We worship you, our precious Savior
[1330.64 --> 1337.44]  Fill us, fill us with your holy power
[1337.44 --> 1343.10]  Set us to claim with your love
[1343.10 --> 1349.12]  Till nations all know your glory
[1349.12 --> 1354.12]  All the earth will declare
[1354.12 --> 1359.12]  That your love is everywhere
[1359.12 --> 1364.12]  The fields will exalt
[1364.12 --> 1368.10]  Seeds resound
[1368.10 --> 1374.12]  Hear the trees joyful cry
[1374.12 --> 1379.12]  Praising you and so will I
[1379.12 --> 1384.12]  A new song I sing
[1384.12 --> 1390.12]  Lord, I will glorify and bless your name
[1390.12 --> 1395.14]  Glorify and bless your name
[1395.14 --> 1396.14]  Glorify and bless your name
[1396.14 --> 1403.14]  Glorify and bless your holy name
[1403.14 --> 1407.14]  You may bless you
[1407.14 --> 1423.20]  Good morning and welcome to Kids Corner
[1423.20 --> 1425.34]  My name is Mr. Mike
[1425.34 --> 1427.42]  And it is Palm Sunday
[1427.42 --> 1428.78]  And I am super thrilled
[1428.78 --> 1432.42]  That there's actually even some kids here in church today
[1432.42 --> 1434.32]  So I'm going to give you guys a little wave
[1434.32 --> 1437.02]  Of course there's always kids in church
[1437.02 --> 1439.22]  But it's Palm Sunday
[1439.22 --> 1443.42]  And I think everybody got these special awesome palm branches given to them
[1443.42 --> 1445.36]  So kids, let's give that one more wave
[1445.36 --> 1447.80]  Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna
[1447.80 --> 1450.18]  Right? We get a wave that on Palm Sunday
[1450.18 --> 1452.12]  Do you guys know what that means?
[1452.58 --> 1453.06]  Hosanna
[1453.06 --> 1455.82]  It's an ancient word, I think
[1455.82 --> 1457.10]  And an ancient tradition
[1457.10 --> 1460.22]  That goes way back when to the Middle East
[1460.22 --> 1464.02]  But when a triumphant someone would come into the city
[1464.02 --> 1466.32]  Or a king or a really important person
[1466.32 --> 1468.52]  They would pull out palm branches
[1468.52 --> 1470.54]  There was lots of palm trees there
[1470.54 --> 1471.88]  In the Middle East
[1471.88 --> 1473.40]  And they would lay them on the ground
[1473.40 --> 1475.32]  And they would wave them in the streets
[1475.32 --> 1476.28]  Like a big parade
[1476.28 --> 1479.36]  And have a big celebration using palm branches
[1479.36 --> 1481.94]  So I'm celebrating today with palm branches
[1481.94 --> 1484.38]  I even wore my palm tree shirt
[1484.38 --> 1488.30]  And we are going to celebrate Palm Sunday all day at my house
[1488.30 --> 1489.24]  And I hope you will too
[1489.24 --> 1493.60]  And before we get going further into today's story
[1493.60 --> 1495.96]  That kind of has a little bit to do with Palm Sunday
[1495.96 --> 1497.98]  We have our memory work
[1497.98 --> 1501.16]  So we've been working on our memory work from Psalm 103
[1501.16 --> 1505.42]  And Owen, Elia, and Caleb are going to help us with that this morning
[1505.42 --> 1533.30]  Thanks guys, that was fantastic
[1533.30 --> 1538.50]  Today's story is a little bit of a follow-up from last week
[1538.50 --> 1543.80]  So last week Mr. Eric talked to us about Jesus in the garden
[1543.80 --> 1548.50]  And Eden Lohbert helped us explain what that story all meant
[1548.50 --> 1550.20]  And some of the things that happened there
[1550.20 --> 1554.92]  And we remember that Jesus, his friends kind of let him down in the garden
[1554.92 --> 1558.48]  And now Jesus has been taken by the soldiers
[1558.48 --> 1561.32]  And I think he's preparing to go to the cross
[1561.32 --> 1564.66]  But here was a big moment too that happened
[1564.66 --> 1566.72]  Just before he went to the cross
[1566.72 --> 1570.46]  When Peter had a discussion with someone
[1570.46 --> 1573.42]  I guess in the city waiting
[1573.42 --> 1576.66]  For some of the big events to keep happening
[1576.66 --> 1579.86]  So this story is called Peter Denies Jesus
[1579.86 --> 1581.78]  And it's found in Luke 22
[1581.78 --> 1584.34]  And also I believe in Matthew 26
[1584.34 --> 1589.86]  Peter denies Jesus
[1589.86 --> 1596.16]  Soldiers dragged Jesus through the streets to Jerusalem's leaders
[1596.16 --> 1597.96]  Are you the son of God?
[1598.16 --> 1598.96]  They asked
[1598.96 --> 1601.38]  I am, Jesus said
[1601.38 --> 1602.40]  Liar!
[1603.00 --> 1603.58]  They shouted
[1603.58 --> 1606.86]  How dare you disrespect God by saying you're his son?
[1607.58 --> 1608.86]  They didn't believe him, did they?
[1609.86 --> 1612.90]  Soldiers whipped him, beat him, bid on him
[1612.90 --> 1615.22]  They made him wear a purple robe
[1615.22 --> 1617.22]  And a crown of sharp thorns
[1617.22 --> 1619.08]  And they made fun of him
[1619.08 --> 1622.08]  Now you look like the king of the Jews
[1622.08 --> 1623.00]  They laughed
[1623.00 --> 1626.10]  But Jesus hadn't done anything wrong
[1626.10 --> 1627.16]  And he knew it
[1627.16 --> 1630.22]  This was all part of God's plan
[1630.22 --> 1633.20]  When the soldiers came
[1633.20 --> 1635.64]  Some of Jesus' disciples were afraid
[1635.64 --> 1636.82]  And ran away
[1636.82 --> 1639.46]  Others, like Peter
[1639.46 --> 1642.18]  Hung around to hear what was happening
[1642.18 --> 1644.82]  Peter was warming himself by a fire
[1644.82 --> 1647.08]  When a servant girl asked him
[1647.08 --> 1650.50]  Aren't you one of those guys who was with Jesus?
[1651.50 --> 1653.48]  No, Peter said
[1653.48 --> 1654.26]  It wasn't me
[1654.26 --> 1656.32]  Another girl asked
[1656.32 --> 1658.64]  Are you sure you look like him?
[1659.50 --> 1661.50]  It wasn't me, Peter said
[1661.50 --> 1663.50]  More people came up
[1663.50 --> 1665.84]  We're sure you're that guy
[1665.84 --> 1669.22]  I don't know Jesus
[1669.22 --> 1670.70]  Peter lied
[1670.70 --> 1672.66]  I've never known Jesus
[1672.66 --> 1675.16]  Then the rooster crowed
[1675.72 --> 1676.34]  Caw
[1676.34 --> 1678.62]  And Peter ran away
[1678.62 --> 1680.10]  And cried and cried
[1680.10 --> 1683.22]  Right up until this moment
[1683.22 --> 1685.78]  Peter had been with Jesus all that time
[1685.78 --> 1688.08]  And he abandoned Jesus in the garden
[1688.08 --> 1690.50]  And Jesus had actually predicted
[1690.50 --> 1691.74]  And said to Peter
[1691.74 --> 1693.10]  You're going to do this
[1693.10 --> 1694.16]  You're going to deny me
[1694.16 --> 1695.60]  And it came true, right?
[1697.02 --> 1699.14]  I wonder how Peter felt that day
[1699.14 --> 1701.38]  Especially afterwards
[1701.38 --> 1702.86]  It says he cried and cried
[1702.86 --> 1705.32]  He must have been so embarrassed
[1705.32 --> 1706.28]  In that moment
[1706.28 --> 1708.94]  And I don't know why he felt that way
[1708.94 --> 1709.98]  And we weren't there maybe
[1709.98 --> 1712.38]  But sometimes
[1712.38 --> 1713.66]  Do we have that sometimes?
[1714.14 --> 1715.28]  Or sometimes we embarrassed
[1715.28 --> 1716.92]  That we're Christians
[1716.92 --> 1718.62]  Or embarrassed that we're
[1718.62 --> 1721.38]  Waving our awesome palm branches around
[1721.38 --> 1723.10]  When we should be celebrating Jesus
[1723.10 --> 1726.64]  Maybe there's like a kid in your class
[1726.64 --> 1727.86]  That doesn't really know Jesus
[1727.86 --> 1728.92]  Or thinks it's kind of silly
[1728.92 --> 1729.80]  That you go to church
[1729.80 --> 1732.74]  Or maybe you're on the soccer team
[1732.74 --> 1734.18]  And some kids kind of think
[1734.18 --> 1736.04]  It's funny that you pray before dinner
[1736.04 --> 1738.12]  Or maybe you even have a cousin
[1738.12 --> 1739.24]  Or an uncle and aunt
[1739.24 --> 1741.14]  Who think all of that
[1741.14 --> 1742.80]  Is just silly believing business
[1742.80 --> 1744.86]  And sometimes you want to pretend
[1744.86 --> 1745.92]  Like you're not a Christian
[1745.92 --> 1746.90]  And it doesn't matter
[1746.90 --> 1750.56]  But I know when Peter did this
[1750.56 --> 1752.98]  Jesus felt really sad about it
[1752.98 --> 1754.96]  And God feels really sad
[1754.96 --> 1756.38]  When we don't acknowledge him
[1756.38 --> 1758.90]  So I have a question for you guys
[1758.90 --> 1760.98]  Do you guys know one of the big
[1760.98 --> 1762.34]  This is getting really crazy now
[1762.34 --> 1762.78]  This question
[1762.78 --> 1764.88]  Do you know one of the big reasons
[1764.88 --> 1766.76]  Why God created you?
[1768.08 --> 1769.56]  He created us
[1769.56 --> 1771.06]  To worship him
[1771.06 --> 1773.20]  And days like Palm Sunday
[1773.20 --> 1774.90]  Where we get to scream Hosanna
[1774.90 --> 1775.74]  And praise him
[1775.74 --> 1778.38]  And be excited to be followers of him
[1778.38 --> 1779.74]  Are a big deal
[1779.74 --> 1782.30]  So let's think of
[1782.30 --> 1783.84]  What are ways that we worship God?
[1783.92 --> 1785.28]  Maybe we don't always have to have
[1785.28 --> 1786.64]  Palm branches with us
[1786.64 --> 1787.70]  And bring that to dinner
[1787.70 --> 1788.38]  And to school
[1788.38 --> 1789.66]  And to soccer practice
[1789.66 --> 1791.60]  But what are some awesome ways
[1791.60 --> 1792.94]  That we can say Hosanna
[1792.94 --> 1793.88]  In our hearts
[1793.88 --> 1795.54]  Throughout the week?
[1796.02 --> 1796.90]  Let's think of a few
[1796.90 --> 1799.98]  Well for sure
[1799.98 --> 1800.88]  We come to church
[1800.88 --> 1801.82]  On Sundays right
[1801.82 --> 1803.64]  And we sing praises to God
[1803.64 --> 1804.82]  And we pray together
[1804.82 --> 1805.96]  And read our Bibles together
[1805.96 --> 1808.38]  I think another really good one
[1808.38 --> 1810.22]  Is having devotion times
[1810.22 --> 1810.92]  With our family
[1810.92 --> 1811.34]  Right?
[1811.54 --> 1813.38]  We learn about Jesus
[1813.38 --> 1815.16]  Maybe some of you guys
[1815.16 --> 1816.14]  Pray before you go to bed
[1816.14 --> 1817.70]  And you ask God to protect you
[1817.70 --> 1818.72]  And you worship him
[1818.72 --> 1819.48]  And say thank you
[1819.48 --> 1820.36]  For all the wonderful things
[1820.36 --> 1821.16]  He's done in the day
[1821.16 --> 1823.34]  Even the little things
[1823.34 --> 1825.30]  Like being extra kind
[1825.30 --> 1826.40]  To someone at school
[1826.40 --> 1827.90]  Or inviting the kid
[1827.90 --> 1828.92]  Who doesn't always get picked
[1828.92 --> 1829.60]  For sports
[1829.60 --> 1831.46]  Those are all awesome ways
[1831.46 --> 1832.74]  That we can say Hosanna
[1832.74 --> 1834.44]  In a different kind of way
[1834.44 --> 1835.52]  That doesn't always involve
[1835.52 --> 1836.14]  Palm branches
[1836.14 --> 1837.84]  But does involve
[1837.84 --> 1839.16]  Glorifying God
[1839.16 --> 1842.26]  So think about that today
[1842.26 --> 1844.02]  As you keep celebrating
[1844.02 --> 1844.76]  Palm Sunday
[1844.76 --> 1845.76]  Maybe take some time
[1845.76 --> 1846.66]  With your mom and dad
[1846.66 --> 1847.96]  Or your brothers and sisters
[1847.96 --> 1848.74]  Or grandma and grandpa
[1848.74 --> 1850.28]  Whoever you're hanging out with today
[1850.28 --> 1851.86]  And think what are some
[1851.86 --> 1852.92]  Interesting different ways
[1852.92 --> 1853.98]  We worship God
[1853.98 --> 1855.36]  That are more than just
[1855.36 --> 1856.28]  Waving palm branches
[1856.28 --> 1857.28]  And saying Hosanna
[1857.28 --> 1859.54]  Let's pray together
[1859.54 --> 1863.82]  Heavenly Father
[1863.82 --> 1864.84]  We thank you so much
[1864.84 --> 1866.02]  For awesome days like today
[1866.02 --> 1867.72]  Where we can worship you
[1867.72 --> 1870.30]  And sing Hosanna
[1870.30 --> 1871.48]  And worship your name
[1871.48 --> 1873.16]  And we pray for those moments
[1873.16 --> 1873.94]  When maybe we feel
[1873.94 --> 1874.78]  A little bit silly
[1874.78 --> 1875.88]  That we're a Christian
[1875.88 --> 1876.64]  When some people
[1876.64 --> 1877.42]  Don't understand
[1877.42 --> 1878.30]  Where we're coming from
[1878.30 --> 1879.02]  Or understand
[1879.02 --> 1879.90]  What our beliefs are
[1879.90 --> 1880.90]  We pray that we would
[1880.90 --> 1881.54]  Have patience
[1881.54 --> 1882.66]  And that we would
[1882.66 --> 1884.70]  Feel the words
[1884.70 --> 1885.72]  To share the love
[1885.72 --> 1886.50]  That you have for us
[1886.50 --> 1887.72]  In your name
[1887.72 --> 1888.32]  Amen
[1888.32 --> 1890.88]  See you next week
[1890.88 --> 1900.24]  Yeah
[1900.24 --> 1901.60]  My name is Paul
[1901.60 --> 1902.86]  And I'm the elder
[1902.86 --> 1903.92]  Serving for today
[1903.92 --> 1906.80]  Let us continue to worship
[1906.80 --> 1908.94]  By giving of our offerings
[1908.94 --> 1910.94]  Although we have a small number
[1910.94 --> 1912.10]  Here in church today
[1912.10 --> 1913.58]  Please continue to give
[1913.58 --> 1914.82]  Using the various means
[1914.82 --> 1916.04]  Listed in the bulletin
[1916.04 --> 1919.30]  Let us give of our first fruits
[1919.30 --> 1921.60]  And may these be a sweet fragrance
[1921.60 --> 1922.34]  To the Lord
[1922.34 --> 1924.34]  Today's offering is for

[1928.70 --> 1930.22]  Staff and ministries

[1932.70 --> 1934.74]  Is for Cascade Christian Counseling
[1934.74 --> 1936.50]  Which offers a caring

[1943.32 --> 1945.52]  And mental health issues
[1945.52 --> 1948.84]  There has been a higher demand
[1948.84 --> 1949.56]  For counselling
[1949.56 --> 1951.60]  During the current pandemic

[1960.24 --> 1961.42]  In need of services
[1961.42 --> 1963.58]  Your donations help those

[1964.48 --> 1965.76]  To afford private
[1965.76 --> 1966.84]  Christian counseling

[1977.86 --> 1980.76]  The next week's offering

[2020.58 --> 2021.86]  That you have welcomed us
[2021.86 --> 2023.58]  Together in spirit

[2030.92 --> 2031.56]  Proclaimed
[2031.56 --> 2034.02]  Lord we confess
[2034.02 --> 2034.82]  That we have not
[2034.82 --> 2035.94]  Followed in your ways
[2035.94 --> 2037.40]  We have not always
[2037.40 --> 2038.38]  Been faithful to you
[2038.38 --> 2039.50]  Forgive us Lord
[2039.50 --> 2041.68]  Renew your spirit
[2041.68 --> 2042.48]  Within us
[2042.48 --> 2045.20]  Lord we lift up

[2048.44 --> 2049.64]  Are living with difficulties
[2049.64 --> 2052.12]  We pray healing
[2052.12 --> 2052.76]  For marriages
[2052.76 --> 2053.64]  That are strained
[2053.64 --> 2054.28]  And the effects
[2054.28 --> 2055.08]  That they have
[2055.08 --> 2055.72]  On children
[2055.72 --> 2056.80]  And families
[2056.80 --> 2060.04]  We pray for our elderly members
[2060.04 --> 2061.12]  Many who are having
[2061.12 --> 2062.74]  Continuing health concerns
[2062.74 --> 2064.76]  Ease their worry
[2064.76 --> 2065.76]  Visit them
[2065.76 --> 2066.78]  With your peace
[2066.78 --> 2069.24]  Comfort those
[2069.24 --> 2070.40]  Who have lost loved ones
[2070.40 --> 2072.96]  Thank you Lord
[2072.96 --> 2074.06]  For the gifts of medicine
[2074.06 --> 2075.94]  In our health care system
[2075.94 --> 2077.50]  Bless the work
[2077.50 --> 2078.22]  That they do
[2078.22 --> 2080.86]  We ask you Lord
[2080.86 --> 2081.88]  To lift up those
[2081.88 --> 2083.18]  Who are feeling down
[2083.18 --> 2085.14]  Some are experiencing
[2085.14 --> 2086.08]  Anxiety
[2086.08 --> 2087.82]  Others who find it
[2087.82 --> 2088.58]  Hard to function
[2088.58 --> 2089.18]  Each day
[2089.18 --> 2090.46]  Visit them
[2090.46 --> 2091.18]  With your spirit
[2091.18 --> 2093.26]  Help them to find joy
[2093.26 --> 2094.26]  Help us
[2094.26 --> 2095.10]  To encourage
[2095.10 --> 2095.68]  One another
[2095.68 --> 2097.34]  That your love
[2097.34 --> 2098.32]  Would uplift us
[2098.32 --> 2100.62]  May the work
[2100.62 --> 2101.72]  Of cascade Christian
[2101.72 --> 2102.40]  Counseling
[2102.40 --> 2103.00]  Be a blessing
[2103.00 --> 2103.82]  In our community
[2103.82 --> 2106.58]  Guide Pastor Chris
[2106.58 --> 2107.32]  With your spirit
[2107.32 --> 2108.44]  And may your word
[2108.44 --> 2109.50]  Find open hearts
[2109.50 --> 2110.54]  And minds
[2110.54 --> 2113.74]  Jesus we remember
[2113.74 --> 2114.58]  As you descended
[2114.58 --> 2115.74]  From the Mount of Olives
[2115.74 --> 2116.70]  And entered Jerusalem
[2116.70 --> 2117.76]  As a king
[2117.76 --> 2119.50]  On a donkey
[2119.50 --> 2120.68]  And the people
[2120.68 --> 2121.62]  Called out to you
[2121.62 --> 2122.16]  Hosanna
[2122.16 --> 2124.20]  Only to see you
[2124.20 --> 2125.64]  Nailed to the cross
[2125.64 --> 2126.62]  Shortly thereafter
[2126.62 --> 2129.22]  Only through your death
[2129.22 --> 2129.90]  And resurrection
[2129.90 --> 2131.56]  May we proclaim joyfully
[2131.56 --> 2132.58]  With the psalmist
[2132.58 --> 2134.76]  Who may ascend
[2134.76 --> 2136.26]  Into the hill of the Lord
[2136.26 --> 2137.34]  And who may stand
[2137.34 --> 2138.38]  In his holy place
[2138.38 --> 2141.12]  He who has a clean hands
[2141.12 --> 2142.18]  And a pure heart
[2142.18 --> 2143.48]  Who has not lifted up
[2143.48 --> 2144.64]  His soul to falsehood
[2144.64 --> 2147.14]  And has not sworn deceitfully
[2147.14 --> 2149.50]  He shall receive a blessing
[2149.50 --> 2150.18]  From the Lord
[2150.18 --> 2150.82]  And righteousness
[2150.82 --> 2151.60]  From the God
[2151.60 --> 2152.36]  Of his salvation
[2152.36 --> 2154.44]  This is the generation
[2154.44 --> 2155.62]  Of those who seek him
[2155.62 --> 2157.02]  Who seek your face
[2157.02 --> 2157.86]  Even Jacob
[2157.86 --> 2160.68]  Lift up your heads
[2160.68 --> 2161.26]  O gates
[2161.26 --> 2162.98]  Be lifted up
[2162.98 --> 2163.96]  O ancient doors
[2163.96 --> 2166.16]  That the king of glory
[2166.16 --> 2166.96]  May come in
[2166.96 --> 2168.74]  Who is this king of glory?
[2169.40 --> 2170.26]  The Lord
[2170.26 --> 2171.86]  Strong and mighty
[2171.86 --> 2174.10]  The Lord mighty in battle
[2174.10 --> 2175.60]  Lift up your heads
[2175.60 --> 2176.20]  O gates
[2176.20 --> 2177.52]  And lift them up
[2177.52 --> 2178.48]  O ancient doors
[2178.48 --> 2179.72]  That the king of glory
[2179.72 --> 2180.46]  May come in
[2180.46 --> 2182.54]  Who is this king of glory?
[2183.54 --> 2184.78]  Lord of hosts
[2184.78 --> 2187.38]  He is the king of glory
[2187.38 --> 2188.80]  Amen
[2188.80 --> 2199.70]  We're going to spend some time
[2199.70 --> 2200.30]  Together now
[2200.30 --> 2201.50]  In God's word
[2201.50 --> 2202.84]  And so if you have a bible handy
[2202.84 --> 2203.80]  I'm going to encourage you
[2203.80 --> 2205.06]  To open that up
[2205.06 --> 2205.90]  Or turn that on
[2205.90 --> 2207.46]  However you find it
[2207.46 --> 2209.64]  We're going to look at
[2209.64 --> 2211.08]  Luke 19
[2211.08 --> 2212.96]  It won't surprise anyone
[2212.96 --> 2214.20]  The story of Jesus
[2214.20 --> 2215.50]  Coming as king
[2215.50 --> 2217.10]  Into Jerusalem
[2217.10 --> 2217.78]  We're going to read
[2217.78 --> 2219.18]  Verse 28 through 40
[2219.18 --> 2220.62]  It will be on the screen
[2220.62 --> 2222.88]  Here and on your devices
[2222.88 --> 2223.46]  As well
[2223.46 --> 2225.38]  But I really do encourage you
[2225.38 --> 2226.06]  To have that with you
[2226.06 --> 2226.72]  Because we're going to flip
[2226.72 --> 2227.46]  In a few places
[2227.46 --> 2228.76]  And look at a couple
[2228.76 --> 2229.48]  Other texts
[2229.48 --> 2230.70]  In the midst of this too
[2230.70 --> 2232.68]  God's word
[2232.68 --> 2234.30]  Open before us
[2234.30 --> 2235.64]  Let's read together
[2235.64 --> 2236.92]  Luke 19
[2236.92 --> 2237.94]  Starting at verse 28
[2237.94 --> 2242.46]  After Jesus had said this
[2242.46 --> 2243.94]  He went up on ahead
[2243.94 --> 2245.58]  Going up to Jerusalem
[2245.58 --> 2248.38]  As he approached Bethpage
[2248.38 --> 2249.00]  And Bethany
[2249.00 --> 2249.70]  At the hill
[2249.70 --> 2251.26]  Called the Mount of Olives
[2251.26 --> 2253.26]  He sent two of his disciples
[2253.26 --> 2254.24]  Saying to them
[2254.24 --> 2256.40]  Go to the village
[2256.40 --> 2257.08]  Ahead of you
[2257.08 --> 2259.34]  And as you enter it
[2259.34 --> 2260.40]  You will find a colt
[2260.40 --> 2261.04]  Tied there
[2261.04 --> 2262.00]  Which no one
[2262.00 --> 2262.84]  Has ever ridden
[2262.84 --> 2264.86]  Untie it
[2264.86 --> 2265.80]  And bring it here
[2265.80 --> 2268.18]  If anyone asks you
[2268.18 --> 2269.58]  Why are you untying it
[2269.58 --> 2269.86]  Say
[2269.86 --> 2271.30]  The Lord needs it
[2271.30 --> 2274.40]  And those who were sent ahead
[2274.40 --> 2275.52]  Went and found it
[2275.52 --> 2277.16]  Just as he had told them
[2277.16 --> 2280.02]  As they were untying the colt
[2280.02 --> 2281.06]  Its owners asked them
[2281.06 --> 2282.62]  Why are you untying the colt
[2282.62 --> 2283.90]  They replied
[2283.90 --> 2285.62]  The Lord needs it
[2285.62 --> 2288.20]  They brought it to Jesus
[2288.20 --> 2290.00]  Threw their cloaks
[2290.00 --> 2290.80]  On the colt
[2290.80 --> 2292.22]  And put Jesus on it
[2292.22 --> 2294.14]  As he went along
[2294.14 --> 2295.54]  People spread their cloaks
[2295.54 --> 2296.14]  On the road
[2296.14 --> 2298.26]  When he came near
[2298.26 --> 2298.80]  To the place
[2298.80 --> 2299.68]  Where the road goes
[2299.68 --> 2300.84]  Down the Mount of Olives
[2300.84 --> 2301.92]  The whole crowd
[2301.92 --> 2302.52]  Of disciples
[2302.52 --> 2303.44]  Began joyfully
[2303.44 --> 2304.30]  To praise God
[2304.30 --> 2305.14]  In loud voices
[2305.14 --> 2306.18]  For all their miracles
[2306.18 --> 2306.90]  They had seen
[2306.90 --> 2308.48]  Blessed is the king
[2308.48 --> 2309.64]  Who comes in the name
[2309.64 --> 2310.22]  Of the Lord
[2310.22 --> 2311.30]  Peace in heaven
[2311.30 --> 2313.20]  And glory in the highest
[2313.20 --> 2316.12]  Some of the Pharisees
[2316.12 --> 2316.74]  In the crowd
[2316.74 --> 2317.66]  Said to Jesus
[2317.66 --> 2318.68]  Teacher
[2318.68 --> 2320.02]  Rebuke your disciples
[2320.02 --> 2322.40]  I tell you
[2322.40 --> 2323.50]  Jesus replied
[2323.50 --> 2325.64]  If they keep quiet
[2325.64 --> 2327.04]  The stones
[2327.04 --> 2328.36]  Will cry out
[2328.36 --> 2330.20]  This is the word
[2330.20 --> 2330.64]  Of the Lord
[2330.64 --> 2335.32]  Now
[2335.32 --> 2337.24]  I love
[2337.24 --> 2337.92]  This
[2337.92 --> 2339.16]  Story
[2339.16 --> 2342.46]  In 2018
[2342.46 --> 2344.16]  I had the
[2344.16 --> 2345.04]  Unique privilege
[2345.04 --> 2346.54]  Of going with
[2346.54 --> 2347.24]  A group of
[2347.24 --> 2347.84]  Pastors
[2347.84 --> 2349.34]  And spouses
[2349.34 --> 2350.32]  On a trip
[2350.32 --> 2351.42]  To Egypt
[2351.42 --> 2352.32]  And Jordan
[2352.32 --> 2353.60]  And Israel
[2353.60 --> 2355.72]  And early
[2355.72 --> 2356.30]  One morning
[2356.30 --> 2357.64]  We stood
[2357.64 --> 2358.48]  On the top
[2358.48 --> 2359.14]  Of the Mount
[2359.14 --> 2359.72]  Of Olives
[2359.72 --> 2361.52]  And looked out
[2361.52 --> 2362.54]  Over Jerusalem
[2362.54 --> 2364.52]  Staring at the temple
[2364.52 --> 2365.94]  And began
[2365.94 --> 2366.78]  Walking
[2366.78 --> 2367.64]  Down
[2367.64 --> 2368.48]  The hill
[2368.48 --> 2370.02]  Into the garden
[2370.02 --> 2370.80]  Of Gethsemane
[2370.80 --> 2371.68]  And then up
[2371.68 --> 2373.20]  Through the sheep's gate
[2373.20 --> 2374.74]  In Jerusalem
[2374.74 --> 2376.98]  And as we stood
[2376.98 --> 2378.08]  On top of
[2378.08 --> 2378.68]  The Mount
[2378.68 --> 2379.22]  Of Olives
[2379.22 --> 2380.18]  As I looked over
[2380.18 --> 2381.50]  The city of Jerusalem
[2381.50 --> 2382.36]  And the temple there
[2382.36 --> 2383.26]  My heart
[2383.26 --> 2384.14]  Couldn't help
[2384.14 --> 2385.02]  But imagine
[2385.02 --> 2386.04]  Palm Sunday
[2386.04 --> 2387.96]  That day
[2387.96 --> 2389.12]  Two thousand years
[2389.12 --> 2389.52]  Before
[2389.52 --> 2391.62]  And maybe the stones
[2391.62 --> 2392.56]  Along the side
[2392.56 --> 2393.14]  Of the road
[2393.14 --> 2395.18]  Being those stones
[2395.18 --> 2395.80]  That Jesus
[2395.80 --> 2397.06]  Spoke about
[2397.06 --> 2398.94]  And as we walked
[2398.94 --> 2399.42]  Together
[2399.42 --> 2400.50]  Down the
[2400.50 --> 2401.30]  Mountain
[2401.30 --> 2402.96]  Into the valley
[2402.96 --> 2403.66]  I couldn't help
[2403.66 --> 2404.26]  But imagine
[2404.26 --> 2405.44]  Both the crowds
[2405.44 --> 2406.06]  Of people
[2406.06 --> 2406.94]  Singing praises
[2406.94 --> 2407.46]  And shouting
[2407.46 --> 2407.92]  Hosanna
[2407.92 --> 2408.90]  And I couldn't help
[2408.90 --> 2409.36]  But imagine
[2409.36 --> 2409.86]  The time
[2409.86 --> 2411.52]  Earlier in the gospel
[2411.52 --> 2412.64]  Jesus looks over
[2412.64 --> 2413.64]  The city of Jerusalem
[2413.64 --> 2414.58]  Or thinks of the city
[2414.58 --> 2415.04]  Of Jerusalem
[2415.04 --> 2416.76]  And he cries out
[2416.76 --> 2418.74]  On her behalf
[2418.74 --> 2419.50]  Saying how I long
[2419.50 --> 2420.46]  To gather you
[2420.46 --> 2421.88]  To himself
[2421.88 --> 2423.86]  And in that moment
[2423.86 --> 2425.02]  I just
[2425.02 --> 2426.10]  Wept
[2426.10 --> 2428.38]  I stood there
[2428.38 --> 2429.66]  And walked
[2429.66 --> 2430.94]  Weeping
[2430.94 --> 2432.84]  Having encountered
[2432.84 --> 2433.90]  This beautiful
[2433.90 --> 2434.76]  Experience
[2434.76 --> 2435.72]  Of Jesus
[2435.72 --> 2436.94]  Made real to me
[2436.94 --> 2437.40]  In a way
[2437.40 --> 2437.86]  That I
[2437.86 --> 2439.76]  Hadn't previously
[2439.76 --> 2441.14]  Explored
[2441.14 --> 2443.58]  I think part of
[2443.58 --> 2444.22]  The reason why
[2444.22 --> 2445.00]  That was so moving
[2445.00 --> 2445.76]  And so meaningful
[2445.76 --> 2446.18]  To me
[2446.18 --> 2446.80]  Is because I've
[2446.80 --> 2447.92]  Always loved
[2447.92 --> 2449.42]  This story
[2449.42 --> 2450.40]  I've always
[2450.40 --> 2450.72]  Really
[2450.72 --> 2451.66]  Had my
[2451.66 --> 2452.24]  Imagination
[2452.24 --> 2452.52]  And my
[2452.52 --> 2452.70]  Heart
[2452.70 --> 2453.22]  Sing in
[2453.22 --> 2453.72]  This story
[2453.72 --> 2454.06]  And I think
[2454.06 --> 2455.02]  Part of that
[2455.02 --> 2455.80]  Goes even further
[2455.80 --> 2456.50]  Back in my
[2456.50 --> 2456.82]  History
[2456.82 --> 2457.28]  Is that when I
[2457.28 --> 2458.06]  Was a kid
[2458.06 --> 2458.64]  In elementary
[2458.64 --> 2459.10]  School
[2459.10 --> 2460.44]  We had someone
[2460.44 --> 2461.08]  Come to
[2461.08 --> 2462.00]  One of our
[2462.00 --> 2463.22]  School chapels
[2463.22 --> 2464.02]  And they
[2464.02 --> 2465.32]  Told this story
[2465.32 --> 2466.32]  From the perspective
[2466.32 --> 2467.34]  Of the stone
[2467.34 --> 2469.50]  As a poem
[2469.50 --> 2471.36]  And for some reason
[2471.36 --> 2471.90]  You know how some
[2471.90 --> 2472.60]  Things just get in
[2472.60 --> 2472.98]  Your head
[2472.98 --> 2473.64]  And they immediately
[2473.64 --> 2474.44]  Go straight into
[2474.44 --> 2474.98]  Your long-term
[2474.98 --> 2475.28]  Memory
[2475.28 --> 2475.72]  And you have no
[2475.72 --> 2476.20]  Idea why
[2476.20 --> 2476.82]  That's the case
[2476.82 --> 2478.26]  That story
[2478.26 --> 2478.98]  And that poem
[2478.98 --> 2479.72]  That experience
[2479.72 --> 2480.34]  Is one of those
[2480.34 --> 2480.62]  Things
[2480.62 --> 2481.30]  And ever since
[2481.30 --> 2481.94]  Then it's just
[2481.94 --> 2483.18]  Sat with me
[2483.18 --> 2484.82]  And I've wondered
[2484.82 --> 2485.98]  What would it be
[2485.98 --> 2486.48]  Like
[2486.48 --> 2489.06]  To be a stone
[2489.06 --> 2490.44]  Praising
[2490.44 --> 2491.40]  Jesus
[2491.40 --> 2492.66]  And so three years
[2492.66 --> 2493.08]  Ago when I
[2493.08 --> 2493.98]  Stood in that
[2493.98 --> 2494.84]  Place and looked
[2494.84 --> 2495.56]  At the stones
[2495.56 --> 2496.22]  On the ground
[2496.22 --> 2497.16]  It hit me
[2497.16 --> 2497.96]  Again
[2497.96 --> 2500.46]  And maybe
[2500.46 --> 2502.20]  All of that
[2502.20 --> 2503.20]  Is really part
[2503.20 --> 2503.94]  Of the same
[2503.94 --> 2504.66]  Reality
[2504.66 --> 2506.60]  Maybe all of that
[2506.60 --> 2507.28]  Is really part
[2507.28 --> 2507.92]  Of the same
[2507.92 --> 2509.02]  Story
[2509.02 --> 2510.80]  Because I think
[2510.80 --> 2511.56]  What Luke
[2511.56 --> 2512.58]  Wants us to see
[2512.58 --> 2513.34]  In this text
[2513.34 --> 2513.88]  And in the very
[2513.88 --> 2515.14]  Particular way
[2515.14 --> 2516.18]  He tells it
[2516.18 --> 2517.50]  Is that having
[2517.50 --> 2518.70]  Jesus as the
[2518.70 --> 2519.68]  Glorious king
[2519.68 --> 2520.54]  Of your life
[2520.54 --> 2521.74]  Is what you
[2521.74 --> 2522.86]  Were created for
[2522.86 --> 2525.46]  Anything less
[2525.46 --> 2526.96]  Isn't enough
[2526.96 --> 2529.58]  Jesus says
[2529.58 --> 2531.40]  If they keep
[2531.40 --> 2531.92]  Quiet
[2531.92 --> 2533.48]  The stones
[2533.48 --> 2534.80]  Will cry out
[2534.80 --> 2537.58]  Why is that
[2537.58 --> 2540.12]  Because the
[2540.12 --> 2540.62]  Universe
[2540.62 --> 2542.42]  As Mr.
[2542.50 --> 2542.76]  Mike
[2542.76 --> 2543.52]  Has already
[2543.52 --> 2543.90]  Said
[2543.90 --> 2545.26]  Was created
[2545.26 --> 2546.92]  For the praise
[2546.92 --> 2547.76]  Of
[2547.76 --> 2548.54]  Jesus
[2548.54 --> 2549.56]  Christ
[2549.56 --> 2550.32]  Right
[2550.32 --> 2551.24]  You exist
[2551.24 --> 2552.20]  We exist
[2552.20 --> 2553.04]  This building
[2553.04 --> 2553.90]  Exists
[2553.90 --> 2554.86]  For the praise
[2554.86 --> 2555.32]  Of Jesus
[2555.32 --> 2555.94]  And if we
[2555.94 --> 2556.72]  Don't do it
[2556.72 --> 2557.90]  The stones
[2557.90 --> 2558.48]  Are going to
[2558.48 --> 2559.30]  Get that glory
[2559.30 --> 2563.14]  But here's
[2563.14 --> 2564.24]  The problem
[2564.24 --> 2565.16]  At least it's
[2565.16 --> 2565.72]  My problem
[2565.72 --> 2566.12]  And I
[2566.12 --> 2567.92]  Imagine it's
[2567.92 --> 2568.36]  Yours too
[2568.36 --> 2570.24]  I spend
[2570.24 --> 2571.12]  Most of my
[2571.12 --> 2571.60]  Life
[2571.60 --> 2573.02]  In praise
[2573.02 --> 2573.70]  Of self
[2573.70 --> 2575.96]  For most of us
[2575.96 --> 2577.24]  Everything we do
[2577.24 --> 2578.22]  We do for we
[2578.22 --> 2579.24]  Right
[2579.24 --> 2580.26]  Everything you do
[2580.26 --> 2581.32]  You do for you
[2581.32 --> 2582.48]  I make my life
[2582.48 --> 2583.56]  All about me
[2583.56 --> 2586.58]  What is grumbling
[2586.58 --> 2588.70]  But complaining
[2588.70 --> 2589.42]  About someone
[2589.42 --> 2590.24]  Or something
[2590.24 --> 2590.96]  Not meeting
[2590.96 --> 2591.66]  My needs
[2591.66 --> 2594.22]  What is pride
[2594.22 --> 2595.32]  Right
[2595.32 --> 2595.62]  It's the
[2595.62 --> 2596.50]  The presumption
[2596.50 --> 2597.14]  Of self
[2597.14 --> 2597.86]  It's boasting
[2597.86 --> 2599.02]  In yourself
[2599.02 --> 2599.74]  In your ability
[2599.74 --> 2600.60]  In your achievement
[2600.60 --> 2603.48]  What is selfishness
[2603.48 --> 2604.80]  But the idea
[2604.80 --> 2605.60]  That I get to
[2605.60 --> 2606.60]  Define myself
[2606.60 --> 2607.24]  And I get to
[2607.24 --> 2607.98]  Decide how
[2607.98 --> 2608.68]  I will live
[2608.68 --> 2609.42]  And you have
[2609.42 --> 2609.96]  To let me
[2609.96 --> 2610.54]  Do that
[2610.54 --> 2612.42]  That way of
[2612.42 --> 2612.78]  Thinking is
[2612.78 --> 2613.90]  Pervasive in our
[2613.90 --> 2614.64]  World and culture
[2614.64 --> 2615.00]  Today
[2615.00 --> 2616.24]  Especially when it
[2616.24 --> 2616.82]  Comes to things
[2616.82 --> 2618.00]  Like sexual identity
[2618.00 --> 2620.86]  Or even more
[2620.86 --> 2621.68]  Insidious
[2621.68 --> 2623.06]  For this way
[2623.06 --> 2623.64]  Of being
[2623.64 --> 2623.94]  Right
[2623.94 --> 2625.16]  Is victimization
[2625.16 --> 2626.04]  Or more accurately
[2626.04 --> 2627.62]  Self-victimization
[2627.62 --> 2627.84]  Right
[2627.84 --> 2629.12]  That nobody loves me
[2629.12 --> 2630.08]  That everybody
[2630.08 --> 2631.10]  Is against me
[2631.10 --> 2633.24]  We make it
[2633.24 --> 2633.92]  About me
[2633.92 --> 2635.68]  And when you
[2635.68 --> 2636.40]  Live for the
[2636.40 --> 2637.56]  Praise of self
[2637.56 --> 2638.60]  You are handing
[2638.60 --> 2639.68]  The glory that
[2639.68 --> 2640.66]  Belongs to Jesus
[2640.66 --> 2641.44]  To another
[2641.44 --> 2643.50]  You're taking it
[2643.50 --> 2644.02]  On yourself
[2644.02 --> 2646.38]  And in the end
[2646.38 --> 2646.92]  Right
[2646.92 --> 2647.42]  What the Bible
[2647.42 --> 2648.28]  Tells us over
[2648.28 --> 2648.70]  And over
[2648.70 --> 2649.32]  From beginning
[2649.32 --> 2650.22]  To the end
[2650.22 --> 2650.98]  Is that Jesus
[2650.98 --> 2652.42]  Won't abide that
[2652.42 --> 2652.86]  Right
[2652.86 --> 2654.04]  He will be praised
[2654.04 --> 2655.36]  He is most worthy
[2655.36 --> 2656.34]  To be praised
[2656.34 --> 2657.50]  Worthy is the Lamb
[2657.50 --> 2658.40]  Who was slain
[2658.40 --> 2659.52]  To receive power
[2659.52 --> 2660.16]  And wealth
[2660.16 --> 2660.86]  And wisdom
[2660.86 --> 2661.52]  And strength
[2661.52 --> 2662.06]  And honor
[2662.06 --> 2662.72]  And glory
[2662.72 --> 2663.32]  And praise
[2663.32 --> 2664.92]  You are worthy
[2664.92 --> 2665.88]  Say the angels
[2665.88 --> 2666.82]  Oh Lord and God
[2666.82 --> 2667.76]  To receive glory
[2667.76 --> 2668.50]  And power
[2668.50 --> 2669.40]  Honor
[2669.40 --> 2670.62]  For you created
[2670.62 --> 2671.36]  All things
[2671.36 --> 2672.58]  And by your will
[2672.58 --> 2673.44]  They were created
[2673.44 --> 2674.52]  And have their being
[2674.52 --> 2676.30]  If you keep quiet
[2676.30 --> 2678.36]  The stones
[2678.36 --> 2679.88]  Will cry out
[2679.88 --> 2682.98]  All throughout the Bible
[2682.98 --> 2684.16]  This rings true
[2684.16 --> 2686.18]  Isaiah 55
[2686.18 --> 2687.56]  Is one of my favorite chapters
[2687.56 --> 2688.28]  In all of the Bible
[2688.28 --> 2689.18]  And there in verse 12
[2689.18 --> 2689.60]  It says
[2689.60 --> 2690.90]  You will go out
[2690.90 --> 2691.60]  In joy
[2691.60 --> 2692.76]  And be led forth
[2692.76 --> 2693.42]  In peace
[2693.42 --> 2694.26]  The mountains
[2694.26 --> 2694.96]  And the hills
[2694.96 --> 2696.48]  Burst into song
[2696.48 --> 2697.06]  Before you
[2697.06 --> 2698.58]  And all the trees
[2698.58 --> 2699.60]  Of the field
[2699.60 --> 2701.16]  Will clap their hands
[2701.16 --> 2703.06]  Psalm 96
[2703.06 --> 2704.04]  Same thing
[2704.04 --> 2705.44]  Let the heavens rejoice
[2705.44 --> 2706.60]  Let the earth be glad
[2706.60 --> 2707.98]  Let the sea resound
[2707.98 --> 2709.00]  And all that is in it
[2709.00 --> 2710.54]  Let the fields
[2710.54 --> 2711.36]  Be jubilant
[2711.36 --> 2712.96]  And everything in them
[2712.96 --> 2715.30]  Then
[2715.30 --> 2717.14]  All the trees
[2717.14 --> 2718.24]  Of the forest
[2718.24 --> 2719.46]  Will sing for joy
[2719.46 --> 2720.40]  They will sing
[2720.40 --> 2721.18]  Before the Lord
[2721.18 --> 2722.06]  For he comes
[2722.06 --> 2723.40]  He comes to judge the earth
[2723.40 --> 2724.06]  And he will judge
[2724.06 --> 2725.22]  The world in righteousness
[2725.22 --> 2727.48]  And the peoples in truth
[2727.48 --> 2728.80]  There is a rich
[2728.80 --> 2730.76]  Biblical tradition
[2730.76 --> 2733.96]  Of generally inanimate things
[2733.96 --> 2736.22]  Becoming intensely animate
[2736.22 --> 2737.98]  In praise of God
[2737.98 --> 2739.04]  Right?
[2739.08 --> 2739.82]  Things like trees
[2739.82 --> 2740.46]  And stones
[2740.46 --> 2741.00]  And mountains
[2741.00 --> 2741.54]  And seas
[2741.54 --> 2742.92]  All bear witness
[2742.92 --> 2744.00]  To the glory
[2744.00 --> 2744.94]  Of God
[2744.94 --> 2747.44]  And what's happening here
[2747.44 --> 2748.70]  On Palm Sunday
[2748.70 --> 2750.68]  Is in the same vein
[2750.68 --> 2751.66]  Of Isaiah
[2751.66 --> 2753.08]  And the Psalms
[2753.08 --> 2753.88]  Right?
[2753.98 --> 2754.42]  God
[2754.42 --> 2755.28]  In Christ
[2755.28 --> 2755.94]  Jesus
[2755.94 --> 2757.20]  Is being given
[2757.20 --> 2758.02]  Glory
[2758.02 --> 2759.24]  Luke is telling us
[2759.24 --> 2760.02]  That Jesus
[2760.02 --> 2762.12]  Is worthy of praise
[2762.12 --> 2763.18]  So much so
[2763.18 --> 2764.08]  That if the people
[2764.08 --> 2765.02]  Don't give it
[2765.02 --> 2765.46]  If the people
[2765.46 --> 2766.12]  Don't cry out
[2766.12 --> 2767.04]  The stones
[2767.04 --> 2768.54]  On which they stand
[2768.54 --> 2768.90]  Will
[2768.90 --> 2771.56]  And so
[2771.56 --> 2774.48]  What does that mean
[2774.48 --> 2775.96]  For our life
[2775.96 --> 2777.04]  And our worship
[2777.04 --> 2778.00]  Right now?
[2778.00 --> 2780.62]  Major theme
[2780.62 --> 2781.58]  Of Luke's gospel
[2781.58 --> 2782.62]  If we were to trace
[2782.62 --> 2783.54]  Out the whole thing
[2783.54 --> 2785.04]  Is God's plan
[2785.04 --> 2785.82]  For salvation
[2785.82 --> 2787.12]  Being particularly
[2787.12 --> 2788.84]  Fulfilled in Jesus
[2788.84 --> 2790.66]  And for Luke
[2790.66 --> 2791.34]  The fulfillment
[2791.34 --> 2792.56]  Of God's plan
[2792.56 --> 2793.30]  For salvation
[2793.30 --> 2794.86]  Doesn't only occur
[2794.86 --> 2795.92]  On the cross
[2795.92 --> 2796.34]  Yes
[2796.34 --> 2797.30]  That's absolutely true
[2797.30 --> 2798.18]  It culminates
[2798.18 --> 2798.86]  On the cross
[2798.86 --> 2799.64]  And with the resurrection
[2799.64 --> 2800.32]  And the ascension
[2800.32 --> 2800.76]  Of Jesus
[2800.76 --> 2801.94]  But the fulfillment
[2801.94 --> 2802.94]  Of God's plan
[2802.94 --> 2803.80]  For salvation
[2803.80 --> 2805.98]  Starts in the incarnation
[2805.98 --> 2809.38]  And becomes increasingly extant
[2809.38 --> 2811.34]  Or increasingly realized
[2811.34 --> 2812.76]  Throughout the entire life
[2812.76 --> 2813.74]  Of Jesus
[2813.74 --> 2816.44]  Over the ten chapters
[2816.44 --> 2817.38]  Previous to where
[2817.38 --> 2818.90]  We started reading
[2818.90 --> 2820.76]  Luke gives us
[2820.76 --> 2821.96]  What is called
[2821.96 --> 2823.16]  The travel narrative
[2823.16 --> 2825.26]  It's the road
[2825.26 --> 2826.14]  To Jerusalem
[2826.14 --> 2827.38]  Right?
[2827.42 --> 2827.96]  The fulfillment
[2827.96 --> 2828.90]  Of God's plan
[2828.90 --> 2829.52]  For salvation
[2829.52 --> 2830.04]  And actually
[2830.04 --> 2831.26]  If you have a Bible handy
[2831.26 --> 2832.34]  I want you to see it
[2832.34 --> 2834.26]  So flip ten chapters back
[2834.26 --> 2835.46]  Go to Luke 9
[2835.46 --> 2837.62]  In your Bible
[2837.62 --> 2839.64]  And look at verse 51
[2839.64 --> 2844.14]  Luke 9 verse 51
[2844.14 --> 2845.56]  Luke writes
[2845.56 --> 2847.50]  As the time approached
[2847.50 --> 2847.96]  For him
[2847.96 --> 2848.58]  That's Jesus
[2848.58 --> 2850.30]  To be taken up to heaven
[2850.30 --> 2852.72]  Jesus resolutely
[2852.72 --> 2855.60]  Set out for Jerusalem
[2855.60 --> 2858.16]  He resolutely
[2858.16 --> 2860.36]  Set out for Jerusalem
[2860.36 --> 2861.70]  Literally there in Greek
[2861.70 --> 2862.62]  The original language
[2862.62 --> 2863.28]  That it was written in
[2863.28 --> 2863.88]  It says
[2863.88 --> 2865.26]  He set his face
[2865.26 --> 2866.66]  To Jerusalem
[2866.66 --> 2868.76]  In the gospel of Luke
[2868.76 --> 2871.22]  Everything from this point forward
[2871.22 --> 2872.62]  From Luke 9 verse 51
[2872.62 --> 2873.64]  Is happening
[2873.64 --> 2875.88]  In the shadow of the cross
[2875.88 --> 2879.00]  Everything that happens
[2879.00 --> 2880.00]  In Jesus' teaching
[2880.00 --> 2880.82]  And his interactions
[2880.82 --> 2881.38]  With people
[2881.38 --> 2882.30]  Is happening
[2882.30 --> 2883.48]  In the shadow of the cross
[2883.48 --> 2883.98]  Is happening
[2883.98 --> 2885.42]  With the cross in view
[2885.42 --> 2886.90]  And so Luke uses it
[2886.90 --> 2889.10]  To fill up our understanding
[2889.10 --> 2890.36]  Of what's taking place
[2890.36 --> 2891.86]  In that journey
[2891.86 --> 2892.86]  What's taking place
[2892.86 --> 2894.82]  On the road to the cross
[2894.82 --> 2896.24]  It's all heading that way
[2896.24 --> 2898.10]  And the travel narrative
[2898.10 --> 2898.94]  That is Jesus
[2898.94 --> 2900.74]  Traveling to Jerusalem
[2900.74 --> 2902.02]  Ends
[2902.02 --> 2903.90]  On Palm Sunday
[2903.90 --> 2907.18]  Ends in our text
[2907.18 --> 2907.46]  Right?
[2907.52 --> 2908.22]  This takes place
[2908.22 --> 2908.72]  As we said
[2908.72 --> 2909.64]  Only one mile
[2909.64 --> 2910.64]  From the city
[2910.64 --> 2911.68]  Of Jerusalem
[2911.68 --> 2912.90]  And so the stage
[2912.90 --> 2914.50]  Is set
[2914.50 --> 2917.18]  And like any good work
[2917.18 --> 2918.46]  Of modern literature
[2918.46 --> 2921.80]  Luke has weaved together
[2921.80 --> 2922.80]  Innuendo
[2922.80 --> 2923.60]  And illusion
[2923.60 --> 2924.76]  And he's confused
[2924.76 --> 2925.90]  Some people on the way
[2925.90 --> 2926.66]  And he's enlightened
[2926.66 --> 2928.02]  Others in the journey
[2928.02 --> 2929.10]  And immediately
[2929.10 --> 2929.82]  At the beginning
[2929.82 --> 2930.56]  Of the story
[2930.56 --> 2931.14]  That we read
[2931.14 --> 2932.64]  Jesus displays
[2932.64 --> 2933.98]  This prophetic knowledge
[2933.98 --> 2934.48]  Right?
[2934.54 --> 2936.02]  Regarding a cult
[2936.02 --> 2937.58]  Or a foal
[2937.58 --> 2938.74]  A baby donkey
[2938.74 --> 2939.56]  Right?
[2939.56 --> 2940.98]  That's in the city ahead
[2940.98 --> 2941.66]  And as we read
[2941.66 --> 2942.74]  The whole exchange
[2942.74 --> 2943.70]  Happens exactly
[2943.70 --> 2944.84]  Like Jesus said it would
[2944.84 --> 2946.42]  And the disciples
[2946.42 --> 2949.18]  Return with the foal
[2949.18 --> 2949.90]  And they remove
[2949.90 --> 2950.58]  Their cloaks
[2950.58 --> 2951.62]  Or their outer clothes
[2951.62 --> 2952.80]  And they place them
[2952.80 --> 2954.44]  On that young donkey's back
[2954.44 --> 2955.62]  And they lift Jesus
[2955.62 --> 2956.34]  Up on it
[2956.34 --> 2958.68]  Now one way
[2958.68 --> 2960.28]  That I like to
[2960.28 --> 2961.60]  Read the Bible
[2961.60 --> 2963.68]  Is by asking
[2963.68 --> 2965.48]  Questions of the text
[2965.48 --> 2966.16]  Right?
[2966.20 --> 2966.74]  I call it
[2966.74 --> 2967.82]  Querying the text
[2967.82 --> 2969.28]  And so
[2969.28 --> 2970.46]  Why does Jesus
[2970.46 --> 2971.56]  Need to ride
[2971.56 --> 2972.12]  On a donkey
[2972.12 --> 2973.50]  Or any animal
[2973.50 --> 2974.36]  In this story
[2974.36 --> 2975.06]  Why does it matter?
[2975.62 --> 2975.74]  Right?
[2975.80 --> 2976.56]  Since he started
[2976.56 --> 2977.82]  This travel narrative
[2977.82 --> 2978.86]  Since he's been
[2978.86 --> 2980.24]  On this long journey
[2980.24 --> 2981.54]  In the region of Galilee
[2981.54 --> 2982.94]  Down through Jericho
[2982.94 --> 2983.96]  Up the Jericho Pass
[2983.96 --> 2984.68]  Into Jerusalem
[2984.68 --> 2986.20]  He has been walking
[2986.20 --> 2987.68]  Right?
[2987.72 --> 2988.28]  And add to that
[2988.28 --> 2988.84]  If you know
[2988.84 --> 2990.40]  Your Jewish history here
[2990.40 --> 2992.32]  This is Passover week
[2992.32 --> 2993.56]  And so
[2993.56 --> 2994.78]  Countless
[2994.78 --> 2995.22]  Hundreds
[2995.22 --> 2996.38]  Thousands of people
[2996.38 --> 2997.38]  Are pilgrimaging
[2997.38 --> 2998.48]  To Jerusalem
[2998.48 --> 2999.66]  They are walking
[2999.66 --> 3000.66]  To Jerusalem
[3000.66 --> 3001.56]  As part of their
[3001.56 --> 3003.58]  Religious festival experience
[3003.58 --> 3004.74]  And for those
[3004.74 --> 3006.36]  Last parts of that journey
[3006.36 --> 3008.10]  Especially that last mile
[3008.10 --> 3009.18]  Into the city
[3009.18 --> 3010.00]  People would make
[3010.00 --> 3010.58]  A point
[3010.58 --> 3011.92]  Of walking
[3011.92 --> 3013.24]  Right?
[3013.32 --> 3014.44]  You slow down
[3014.44 --> 3016.48]  You get pensive
[3016.48 --> 3017.92]  And introspective
[3017.92 --> 3018.94]  As you are approaching
[3018.94 --> 3020.62]  The city of God
[3020.62 --> 3022.94]  But not Jesus
[3022.94 --> 3024.80]  And what does it mean
[3024.80 --> 3025.32]  That Luke
[3025.32 --> 3026.18]  And the other gospels
[3026.18 --> 3027.66]  Include this particular fact
[3027.66 --> 3028.98]  That he rode
[3028.98 --> 3030.00]  On a donkey
[3030.00 --> 3032.20]  And even more
[3032.20 --> 3032.88]  Why does it matter
[3032.88 --> 3034.06]  That Jesus describes
[3034.06 --> 3034.76]  This donkey
[3034.76 --> 3035.90]  As a foal
[3035.90 --> 3036.62]  One on which
[3036.62 --> 3037.82]  No person has ever written
[3037.82 --> 3040.02]  And then the big question
[3040.02 --> 3041.02]  For the day
[3041.02 --> 3043.20]  How does all of this
[3043.20 --> 3044.22]  Get us to the point
[3044.22 --> 3045.54]  Where even the stones
[3045.54 --> 3046.70]  Cry out in praise
[3046.70 --> 3048.36]  And so Luke
[3048.36 --> 3049.72]  Is very carefully
[3049.72 --> 3051.64]  Crafting a story together
[3051.64 --> 3052.24]  And he's included
[3052.24 --> 3053.38]  All these little signs
[3053.38 --> 3054.24]  In the text
[3054.24 --> 3056.04]  Now this procession
[3056.04 --> 3056.64]  That's happening
[3056.64 --> 3057.44]  One mile
[3057.44 --> 3058.74]  Outside of Jerusalem
[3058.74 --> 3061.56]  Is a royal procession
[3061.56 --> 3064.02]  As Luke has worked out
[3064.02 --> 3065.66]  His gospel story
[3065.66 --> 3067.04]  As he's conveyed to us
[3067.04 --> 3068.50]  God's plan for salvation
[3068.50 --> 3069.80]  Throughout the gospel
[3069.80 --> 3072.06]  Two things have become clear
[3072.06 --> 3072.90]  First
[3072.90 --> 3074.14]  Humanity
[3074.14 --> 3074.74]  We
[3074.74 --> 3076.60]  Cannot save ourselves
[3076.60 --> 3078.28]  We need a mediator
[3078.28 --> 3079.08]  We need a savior
[3079.08 --> 3080.66]  In Luke 4
[3080.66 --> 3081.74]  Jesus says
[3081.74 --> 3083.38]  The father has sent me
[3083.38 --> 3084.98]  To proclaim freedom
[3084.98 --> 3085.80]  For the prisoners
[3085.80 --> 3086.86]  And recovery of sight
[3086.86 --> 3087.46]  For the blind
[3087.46 --> 3088.62]  To set the oppressed free
[3088.62 --> 3089.74]  To proclaim the year
[3089.74 --> 3090.68]  Of the lord's favor
[3090.68 --> 3092.22]  In the next chapter
[3092.22 --> 3092.80]  Luke 5
[3092.80 --> 3093.52]  Jesus says
[3093.52 --> 3094.44]  It's not the healthy
[3094.44 --> 3095.24]  Who need a doctor
[3095.24 --> 3095.90]  But the sick
[3095.90 --> 3096.74]  I have come
[3096.74 --> 3097.82]  Not to call the righteous
[3097.82 --> 3098.90]  But sinners
[3098.90 --> 3100.10]  To repentance
[3100.10 --> 3101.46]  Right
[3101.46 --> 3102.42]  To Zacchaeus
[3102.42 --> 3103.44]  Jesus says
[3103.44 --> 3104.26]  The son of man
[3104.26 --> 3105.22]  Has come to seek
[3105.22 --> 3105.94]  And save
[3105.94 --> 3107.38]  The lost
[3107.38 --> 3108.70]  Luke tells us
[3108.70 --> 3109.22]  That we need
[3109.22 --> 3110.14]  A savior
[3110.14 --> 3111.78]  And then the second thing
[3111.78 --> 3112.96]  That Luke is weaving
[3112.96 --> 3114.26]  Into this story
[3114.26 --> 3115.06]  Is telling us
[3115.06 --> 3116.46]  That we need
[3116.46 --> 3117.24]  A mediator
[3117.24 --> 3118.74]  Who needs to be human
[3118.74 --> 3119.76]  Yes and amen
[3119.76 --> 3120.60]  But he also needs
[3120.60 --> 3121.18]  To be more
[3121.18 --> 3121.92]  Right
[3121.92 --> 3122.54]  This mediator
[3122.54 --> 3123.76]  Needs to be God
[3123.76 --> 3124.68]  He needs to be king
[3124.68 --> 3125.96]  Over the entire universe
[3125.96 --> 3126.74]  In short
[3126.74 --> 3127.56]  What Luke is saying
[3127.56 --> 3128.32]  What we're seeing here
[3128.32 --> 3129.44]  In this Palm Sunday narrative
[3129.44 --> 3130.30]  Is that we need
[3130.30 --> 3131.96]  A mediator king
[3131.96 --> 3133.44]  Right
[3133.44 --> 3134.14]  In this event
[3134.14 --> 3135.18]  In Luke 19
[3135.18 --> 3135.86]  Palm Sunday
[3135.86 --> 3136.72]  Is simultaneously
[3136.72 --> 3137.78]  The pronouncement
[3137.78 --> 3139.76]  Of Jesus' royal identity
[3139.76 --> 3141.12]  As Messiah
[3141.12 --> 3142.82]  And
[3142.82 --> 3146.38]  That he would die
[3146.38 --> 3148.02]  In our place
[3148.02 --> 3149.26]  See the word Messiah
[3149.26 --> 3151.08]  Means anointed one
[3151.08 --> 3152.82]  And it is both
[3152.82 --> 3153.72]  A royal term
[3153.72 --> 3154.94]  As you anoint
[3154.94 --> 3155.90]  A king with oil
[3155.90 --> 3157.64]  And it is
[3157.64 --> 3158.78]  A sacrificial term
[3158.78 --> 3160.36]  As you pour oil
[3160.36 --> 3161.18]  Over the altar
[3161.18 --> 3162.50]  In the temple
[3162.50 --> 3165.36]  Jesus is
[3165.36 --> 3166.86]  Sacrificial
[3166.86 --> 3168.20]  King
[3168.20 --> 3170.28]  Now in Bible times
[3170.28 --> 3171.34]  The king
[3171.34 --> 3172.14]  Or the warrior
[3172.14 --> 3172.92]  Would ride
[3172.92 --> 3174.40]  Into his city
[3174.40 --> 3175.76]  After a successful battle
[3175.76 --> 3176.74]  On a steed
[3176.74 --> 3177.94]  Or a stallion of war
[3177.94 --> 3179.24]  With people shouting
[3179.24 --> 3180.18]  Shouts of praise
[3180.18 --> 3180.70]  Hosanna
[3180.70 --> 3181.94]  One of those words
[3181.94 --> 3182.34]  Right
[3182.34 --> 3183.80]  Jesus comes into the city
[3183.80 --> 3184.88]  Riding on an animal
[3184.88 --> 3185.52]  As well
[3185.52 --> 3186.50]  Yet it's not
[3186.50 --> 3187.42]  This dignified
[3187.42 --> 3188.26]  War horse
[3188.26 --> 3190.14]  It's a donkey
[3190.14 --> 3191.64]  A young donkey
[3191.64 --> 3192.42]  One that hasn't been
[3192.42 --> 3193.14]  Ridden
[3193.14 --> 3193.80]  Which means
[3193.80 --> 3194.56]  That it is suitable
[3194.56 --> 3195.38]  For royal use
[3195.38 --> 3197.04]  Because it's a clean animal
[3197.04 --> 3199.02]  But it's still a donkey
[3199.02 --> 3201.16]  Donkeys are humble
[3201.16 --> 3201.78]  And common
[3201.78 --> 3202.68]  And unimposing
[3202.68 --> 3203.30]  And simple
[3203.30 --> 3204.72]  To put it
[3204.72 --> 3205.78]  In a way
[3205.78 --> 3206.94]  Donkeys are a pain
[3206.94 --> 3207.48]  In the donkey
[3207.48 --> 3210.34]  On that same trip
[3210.34 --> 3211.44]  That I talked about earlier
[3211.44 --> 3213.82]  We were in Petra
[3213.82 --> 3214.46]  For a day
[3214.46 --> 3215.86]  And as we descended
[3215.86 --> 3216.74]  Into the crevices
[3216.74 --> 3217.44]  Of Petra
[3217.44 --> 3219.90]  And spent the day
[3219.90 --> 3220.72]  Walking and looking
[3220.72 --> 3221.72]  Around and climbing
[3221.72 --> 3222.80]  To get out
[3222.80 --> 3223.84]  We rode donkeys
[3223.84 --> 3225.92]  To climb back out
[3225.92 --> 3227.96]  And like I said
[3227.96 --> 3229.54]  Donkeys are donkeys
[3229.54 --> 3231.20]  They don't listen
[3231.20 --> 3232.28]  They didn't do
[3232.28 --> 3233.36]  What we tell them to do
[3233.36 --> 3234.44]  They would run
[3234.44 --> 3235.12]  At one point
[3235.12 --> 3235.54]  And then they would
[3235.54 --> 3236.30]  Stop at another
[3236.30 --> 3237.26]  We had one person
[3237.26 --> 3237.94]  Who actually went
[3237.94 --> 3238.78]  Off the trail
[3238.78 --> 3239.34]  And the donkey
[3239.34 --> 3240.64]  Like literally ran them
[3240.64 --> 3241.82]  Into the cliff edge
[3241.82 --> 3245.02]  But here comes Jesus
[3245.02 --> 3247.14]  Riding on a donkey
[3247.14 --> 3249.74]  A king would never
[3249.74 --> 3250.80]  Ride a donkey
[3250.80 --> 3251.86]  To war
[3251.86 --> 3252.74]  At least not
[3252.74 --> 3253.40]  If you're serious
[3253.40 --> 3254.00]  About it
[3254.00 --> 3256.04]  But that's Luke's point
[3256.04 --> 3257.54]  Right
[3257.54 --> 3258.44]  The one who comes
[3258.44 --> 3259.50]  Riding on a donkey
[3259.50 --> 3261.10]  Isn't about war
[3261.10 --> 3263.06]  But about peace
[3263.06 --> 3264.62]  And service
[3264.62 --> 3266.92]  Jesus is king
[3266.92 --> 3267.86]  But he's not a king
[3267.86 --> 3269.48]  Like every other king
[3269.48 --> 3270.06]  Right
[3270.06 --> 3270.58]  There's something
[3270.58 --> 3271.86]  Uniquely different
[3271.86 --> 3273.60]  About Jesus as king
[3273.60 --> 3274.46]  Right
[3274.46 --> 3275.30]  This king
[3275.30 --> 3276.28]  Comes to bring
[3276.28 --> 3277.04]  Peace
[3277.04 --> 3278.08]  And not war
[3278.08 --> 3279.62]  And look at what Luke
[3279.62 --> 3280.80]  Records as people say
[3280.80 --> 3281.02]  Right
[3281.02 --> 3281.40]  They say
[3281.40 --> 3282.98]  Blessed is the king
[3282.98 --> 3284.26]  Who comes in the name
[3284.26 --> 3284.80]  Of the Lord
[3284.80 --> 3286.00]  Peace in heaven
[3286.00 --> 3287.40]  And glory in the highest
[3287.40 --> 3289.36]  Now that first half
[3289.36 --> 3290.54]  Of what they say
[3290.54 --> 3292.30]  Is from Psalm 118
[3292.30 --> 3293.04]  Verse 26
[3293.04 --> 3294.20]  Blessed is he
[3294.20 --> 3295.24]  Who comes in the name
[3295.24 --> 3295.76]  Of the Lord
[3295.76 --> 3296.72]  Which is a greeting
[3296.72 --> 3298.06]  That people would use
[3298.06 --> 3299.06]  When traveling
[3299.06 --> 3300.10]  To Jerusalem
[3300.10 --> 3301.80]  For the great feasts
[3301.80 --> 3302.68]  Like Passover
[3302.68 --> 3304.12]  But Luke
[3304.12 --> 3305.14]  Puts the title
[3305.14 --> 3305.86]  King
[3305.86 --> 3306.74]  In there
[3306.74 --> 3307.54]  Right
[3307.54 --> 3308.16]  And he confirms
[3308.16 --> 3308.54]  In that
[3308.54 --> 3309.18]  That this is no
[3309.18 --> 3310.66]  Ordinary processional
[3310.66 --> 3311.92]  Into Jerusalem
[3311.92 --> 3312.72]  Rather this is
[3312.72 --> 3313.38]  A processional
[3313.38 --> 3314.46]  Of the king
[3314.46 --> 3315.68]  Coming into
[3315.68 --> 3316.54]  The city of God
[3316.54 --> 3318.60]  And then the second half
[3318.60 --> 3319.54]  Of what is said
[3319.54 --> 3320.32]  There by the people
[3320.32 --> 3321.70]  Is an inversion
[3321.70 --> 3322.80]  Of the words
[3322.80 --> 3323.40]  That the angels
[3323.40 --> 3324.86]  Spoke over Jesus' birth
[3324.86 --> 3325.72]  Right
[3325.72 --> 3326.50]  Glory to God
[3326.50 --> 3327.06]  In the highest
[3327.06 --> 3328.12]  And on earth
[3328.12 --> 3329.16]  Peace to men
[3329.16 --> 3331.78]  But you notice
[3331.78 --> 3333.28]  In Luke's telling
[3333.28 --> 3333.98]  Of the story
[3333.98 --> 3334.94]  Something uniquely
[3334.94 --> 3335.90]  Different
[3335.90 --> 3338.44]  In Luke's telling
[3338.44 --> 3339.10]  Of the story
[3339.10 --> 3339.94]  There's no
[3339.94 --> 3340.84]  Hosanna songs
[3340.84 --> 3342.40]  There's no palm
[3342.40 --> 3343.32]  Branches even
[3343.32 --> 3345.46]  And he does that
[3345.46 --> 3346.22]  For a purpose
[3346.22 --> 3347.06]  Right
[3347.06 --> 3348.00]  He's showing us
[3348.00 --> 3349.04]  Jesus as a
[3349.04 --> 3349.76]  Different kind
[3349.76 --> 3350.50]  Of king
[3350.50 --> 3351.38]  Hosanna choruses
[3351.38 --> 3352.06]  And palm branches
[3352.06 --> 3353.32]  Are used in parade
[3353.32 --> 3354.18]  Festivals
[3354.18 --> 3354.78]  And for kings
[3354.78 --> 3356.10]  That have nationalistic
[3356.10 --> 3357.52]  And militaristic
[3357.52 --> 3358.56]  Overtones
[3358.56 --> 3359.34]  And Luke
[3359.34 --> 3360.40]  Also in his
[3360.40 --> 3361.22]  Telling of the story
[3361.22 --> 3362.20]  Excludes references
[3362.20 --> 3363.24]  We find in other places
[3363.24 --> 3364.44]  To David's throne
[3364.44 --> 3366.12]  And to the kind
[3366.12 --> 3367.28]  Of king that David was
[3367.28 --> 3368.04]  Because if you know
[3368.04 --> 3368.82]  Your bible stories
[3368.82 --> 3369.06]  Right
[3369.06 --> 3370.22]  David is a king
[3370.22 --> 3372.02]  Who lived and died
[3372.02 --> 3373.24]  By the sword
[3373.24 --> 3375.46]  The kingdom of Jesus
[3375.46 --> 3376.58]  Is a different
[3376.58 --> 3377.46]  Kind of kingdom
[3377.46 --> 3379.76]  Instead of palm branches
[3379.76 --> 3380.74]  And hosannas
[3380.74 --> 3381.52]  The people
[3381.52 --> 3382.90]  Actually remove
[3382.90 --> 3383.86]  Their garments
[3383.86 --> 3385.10]  They remove
[3385.10 --> 3385.84]  Their coats
[3385.84 --> 3387.04]  And they lay them
[3387.04 --> 3388.84]  Out on Jesus' path
[3388.84 --> 3389.36]  Right
[3389.36 --> 3390.06]  They take their
[3390.06 --> 3391.28]  Symbols of power
[3391.28 --> 3392.16]  And order
[3392.16 --> 3393.06]  And being well
[3393.06 --> 3393.54]  Dressed
[3393.54 --> 3394.14]  And prim
[3394.14 --> 3394.74]  And proper
[3394.74 --> 3395.76]  And they lay them
[3395.76 --> 3396.62]  At the feet
[3396.62 --> 3397.46]  Of the king
[3397.46 --> 3398.08]  They take their
[3398.08 --> 3399.00]  Symbols of status
[3399.00 --> 3399.82]  And power
[3399.82 --> 3400.62]  And wealth
[3400.62 --> 3401.60]  And they lay them
[3401.60 --> 3402.48]  In front of their
[3402.48 --> 3403.80]  Mediator king
[3403.80 --> 3404.66]  Instead of putting
[3404.66 --> 3405.50]  On the trappings
[3405.50 --> 3406.06]  Of war
[3406.06 --> 3407.22]  People are divesting
[3407.22 --> 3408.60]  Themselves of status
[3408.60 --> 3409.52]  And power
[3409.52 --> 3410.56]  And we see this
[3410.56 --> 3411.22]  Over and over
[3411.22 --> 3412.24]  In the kingdom
[3412.24 --> 3413.14]  That Jesus comes
[3413.14 --> 3414.00]  To bring
[3414.00 --> 3415.12]  It's kingdom of peace
[3415.12 --> 3416.08]  In which all people
[3416.08 --> 3417.54]  Are made equal
[3417.54 --> 3418.20]  Right
[3418.20 --> 3418.94]  There's no more rich
[3418.94 --> 3419.48]  Or poor
[3419.48 --> 3420.56]  There's no more well fed
[3420.56 --> 3421.24]  Or not fed
[3421.24 --> 3422.06]  There's no more CEO
[3422.06 --> 3423.16]  Or homeless
[3423.16 --> 3424.60]  In the kingdom of Jesus
[3424.60 --> 3425.60]  Mediator king
[3425.60 --> 3426.62]  All are equal
[3426.62 --> 3427.52]  All are equal
[3427.52 --> 3429.46]  This is the kingdom
[3429.46 --> 3430.08]  Of God
[3430.08 --> 3431.34]  Inaugurated here
[3431.34 --> 3432.90]  In this world
[3432.90 --> 3433.62]  With the coming
[3433.62 --> 3435.20]  Of our mediator king
[3435.20 --> 3435.70]  And yes
[3435.70 --> 3436.54]  He is a king
[3436.54 --> 3437.40]  And yet
[3437.40 --> 3438.34]  This king
[3438.34 --> 3440.14]  Came to serve
[3440.14 --> 3441.40]  This king
[3441.40 --> 3443.08]  Came to die
[3443.08 --> 3445.34]  The king of peace
[3445.34 --> 3447.12]  Came to bring peace
[3447.12 --> 3447.64]  And yet
[3447.64 --> 3448.84]  He had to suffer
[3448.84 --> 3451.10]  Incalculable violence
[3451.10 --> 3453.66]  This mediator king
[3453.66 --> 3454.44]  Came to make us
[3454.44 --> 3455.00]  All equal
[3455.00 --> 3455.42]  And yet
[3455.42 --> 3456.50]  He made himself
[3456.50 --> 3457.82]  Worthless
[3457.82 --> 3460.40]  The prince of peace
[3460.40 --> 3461.92]  Was broken
[3461.92 --> 3463.76]  For your sake
[3463.76 --> 3466.26]  This is the gospel
[3466.26 --> 3468.02]  Of Jesus Christ
[3468.02 --> 3469.54]  This is the gospel
[3469.54 --> 3470.34]  The good news
[3470.34 --> 3471.04]  Of God's plan
[3471.04 --> 3471.64]  For salvation
[3471.64 --> 3472.58]  That Jesus came
[3472.58 --> 3473.54]  Into this world
[3473.54 --> 3474.64]  And lived the life
[3474.64 --> 3475.32]  I should have lived
[3475.32 --> 3476.36]  And died the death
[3476.36 --> 3477.52]  That I deserved
[3477.52 --> 3478.74]  That the king
[3478.74 --> 3479.70]  Of everything
[3479.70 --> 3481.16]  Became king
[3481.16 --> 3481.82]  By becoming
[3482.34 --> 3483.00]  Nothing
[3483.00 --> 3486.00]  And in holy week
[3486.00 --> 3486.84]  And at Easter
[3486.84 --> 3487.94]  We remember
[3487.94 --> 3488.70]  What it took
[3488.70 --> 3489.80]  For the king
[3489.80 --> 3491.58]  To make us
[3491.58 --> 3492.48]  Kingly
[3492.48 --> 3494.06]  We remember
[3494.06 --> 3494.60]  What God
[3494.60 --> 3495.38]  Had to do
[3495.38 --> 3495.96]  For us
[3495.96 --> 3497.42]  To be godly
[3497.42 --> 3498.16]  We remember
[3498.16 --> 3498.90]  That the kingdom
[3498.90 --> 3499.62]  Of God
[3499.62 --> 3500.74]  Cost God
[3500.74 --> 3501.32]  Himself
[3501.32 --> 3504.70]  This is the royal
[3504.70 --> 3505.28]  Tradition
[3505.28 --> 3507.04]  That we enter into
[3507.04 --> 3508.78]  As followers
[3508.78 --> 3509.34]  Of Jesus
[3509.34 --> 3510.84]  As children
[3510.84 --> 3511.68]  Of this
[3511.68 --> 3512.56]  Kingdom
[3512.56 --> 3513.42]  We are heirs
[3513.42 --> 3513.98]  Of God
[3513.98 --> 3514.86]  And co-heirs
[3514.86 --> 3515.86]  With Christ
[3515.86 --> 3516.38]  And yes
[3516.38 --> 3516.98]  We share
[3516.98 --> 3517.72]  In his suffering
[3517.72 --> 3518.62]  And in his death
[3518.62 --> 3519.22]  And humility
[3519.22 --> 3520.52]  But we also share
[3520.52 --> 3521.36]  In his joy
[3521.36 --> 3522.38]  And his resurrection
[3522.38 --> 3523.52]  And his glory
[3523.52 --> 3526.56]  He's a
[3526.56 --> 3527.42]  Reformed
[3527.42 --> 3528.44]  Theologian
[3528.44 --> 3529.16]  He's a professor
[3529.16 --> 3530.66]  Many years ago
[3530.66 --> 3531.62]  At Calvin Seminary
[3531.62 --> 3532.20]  Where I attended
[3532.20 --> 3532.66]  His name is
[3532.66 --> 3533.62]  Louis Burkhoff
[3533.62 --> 3535.16]  And he has
[3535.16 --> 3536.08]  This beautiful quote
[3536.08 --> 3537.30]  He says
[3537.30 --> 3538.32]  That Christ's
[3538.32 --> 3539.92]  Mediatorial kingship
[3539.92 --> 3541.72]  Is his official power
[3541.72 --> 3543.10]  To rule all things
[3543.10 --> 3543.60]  In heaven
[3543.60 --> 3544.72]  And on earth
[3544.72 --> 3546.02]  For the glory
[3546.02 --> 3546.68]  Of God
[3546.68 --> 3547.92]  And for the execution
[3547.92 --> 3549.14]  Of God's purpose
[3549.14 --> 3549.98]  Of salvation
[3549.98 --> 3550.98]  On earth
[3550.98 --> 3552.04]  Right
[3552.04 --> 3553.06]  Did you catch
[3553.06 --> 3553.76]  What Burkhoff
[3553.76 --> 3554.44]  Says there
[3554.44 --> 3554.84]  Right
[3554.84 --> 3556.22]  He's the mediator king
[3556.22 --> 3557.14]  Of peace
[3557.14 --> 3558.14]  For the sake
[3558.14 --> 3559.42]  Of glory
[3559.42 --> 3560.40]  For the glory
[3560.40 --> 3560.88]  Of God
[3560.88 --> 3561.56]  This is why
[3561.56 --> 3562.30]  The stones
[3562.30 --> 3563.34]  Would have cried out
[3563.34 --> 3564.04]  Right
[3564.04 --> 3564.94]  The kingdom
[3564.94 --> 3566.08]  Already started
[3566.08 --> 3566.64]  With Jesus
[3566.64 --> 3567.38]  Life, death,
[3567.52 --> 3567.86]  Resurrection
[3567.86 --> 3568.92]  And exaltation
[3568.92 --> 3570.42]  Is a spiritual kingdom
[3570.42 --> 3571.60]  That causes all
[3571.60 --> 3572.24]  Of creation
[3572.24 --> 3573.48]  To cry out
[3573.48 --> 3575.56]  It's not about
[3575.56 --> 3576.14]  Geography
[3576.14 --> 3577.36]  It's not about
[3577.36 --> 3577.74]  Borders
[3577.74 --> 3578.70]  It's not about
[3578.70 --> 3579.72]  Political identity
[3579.72 --> 3580.62]  To one group
[3580.62 --> 3581.14]  Or party
[3581.14 --> 3581.96]  Or another
[3581.96 --> 3582.40]  Right
[3582.40 --> 3583.00]  Luke uses
[3583.00 --> 3584.50]  Very careful language
[3584.50 --> 3586.02]  To make that clear
[3586.02 --> 3589.56]  The kingdom of God
[3589.56 --> 3590.72]  Over which Jesus
[3590.72 --> 3591.82]  Is the mediator king
[3591.82 --> 3592.78]  Is not particular
[3592.78 --> 3593.70]  To the Jews
[3593.70 --> 3594.78]  Or to Israel
[3594.78 --> 3596.00]  Or to Canadians
[3596.00 --> 3597.06]  Or Americans
[3597.06 --> 3597.64]  Or any other
[3597.64 --> 3599.02]  National or people group
[3599.02 --> 3599.64]  It's not about
[3599.64 --> 3600.78]  Race or language
[3600.78 --> 3601.34]  Or gender
[3601.34 --> 3602.00]  Or class
[3602.00 --> 3603.44]  Rather the citizens
[3603.44 --> 3604.94]  Of the kingdom of God
[3604.94 --> 3606.16]  Are the more beautiful
[3606.16 --> 3607.50]  Picture of those
[3607.50 --> 3608.96]  Who are poor in spirit
[3608.96 --> 3610.22]  Of those who are meek
[3610.22 --> 3610.96]  And merciful
[3610.96 --> 3611.92]  And peacemakers
[3611.92 --> 3612.96]  Pure in heart
[3612.96 --> 3614.44]  And those who hunger
[3614.44 --> 3615.52]  And thirst
[3615.52 --> 3616.78]  For righteousness
[3616.78 --> 3619.64]  And so in contrast
[3619.64 --> 3620.48]  To grumbling
[3620.48 --> 3621.34]  Or pride
[3621.34 --> 3622.20]  Or selfishness
[3622.20 --> 3623.10]  In contrast
[3623.10 --> 3624.32]  To self-victimization
[3624.32 --> 3625.86]  The gospel of Jesus
[3625.86 --> 3627.04]  Transforms you
[3627.04 --> 3628.90]  Into something new
[3628.90 --> 3631.44]  Instead of grumbling
[3631.44 --> 3632.52]  There is worship
[3632.52 --> 3633.32]  Of Jesus
[3633.32 --> 3634.46]  Instead of pride
[3634.46 --> 3635.38]  There is humility
[3635.38 --> 3637.00]  For receiving Jesus
[3637.00 --> 3638.84]  Instead of selfishness
[3638.84 --> 3640.04]  There is selflessness
[3640.04 --> 3641.72]  In living for Jesus
[3641.72 --> 3643.12]  Instead of self-victimization
[3643.12 --> 3643.86]  There is victory
[3643.86 --> 3646.04]  With and from Jesus
[3646.04 --> 3648.20]  This is the truth
[3648.20 --> 3649.86]  For which you were created
[3649.86 --> 3652.32]  And for which you have been recreated
[3652.32 --> 3653.68]  Anything less
[3653.68 --> 3655.04]  Is actually really
[3655.04 --> 3656.18]  Nothing at all
[3656.18 --> 3658.64]  It's a chasing after the wind
[3658.64 --> 3659.56]  To use the image
[3659.56 --> 3660.44]  From Ecclesiastes
[3660.44 --> 3661.56]  It's a hopelessness
[3661.56 --> 3663.56]  It's a never-ending emptiness
[3663.56 --> 3665.04]  But Jesus
[3665.04 --> 3667.36]  Jesus
[3667.36 --> 3669.10]  Is the joy
[3669.10 --> 3670.60]  Of salvation
[3670.60 --> 3672.88]  He is the bread of life
[3672.88 --> 3674.52]  The firstborn over all creation
[3674.52 --> 3676.40]  The ruler over all the universe
[3676.40 --> 3678.48]  He is before all things
[3678.48 --> 3679.28]  And in him
[3679.28 --> 3681.38]  All things hold together
[3681.38 --> 3684.78]  And when Jesus walked this road
[3684.78 --> 3686.38]  The people praised him
[3686.38 --> 3689.00]  When I walked that same road
[3689.00 --> 3691.00]  I praised him with my tears
[3691.00 --> 3693.28]  And this morning
[3693.28 --> 3695.48]  As we are about to sing
[3695.48 --> 3698.36]  I see a generation
[3698.36 --> 3701.58]  Rising up to take their place
[3701.58 --> 3703.06]  With selfless faith
[3703.06 --> 3706.26]  I see a revival
[3706.26 --> 3707.22]  Stirring
[3707.22 --> 3708.26]  As we pray
[3708.26 --> 3709.00]  And seek
[3709.00 --> 3711.16]  And so will you be
[3711.16 --> 3712.32]  That generation
[3712.32 --> 3713.44]  That rises up
[3713.44 --> 3714.94]  Will you be
[3714.94 --> 3715.90]  That generation
[3715.90 --> 3716.80]  Who doesn't give
[3716.80 --> 3717.64]  Our chance
[3717.64 --> 3718.92]  Away to the stones
[3718.92 --> 3720.80]  Will you be
[3720.80 --> 3721.58]  The revival
[3721.58 --> 3722.98]  Of the kingdom come
[3722.98 --> 3724.06]  And the kingdom coming
[3724.06 --> 3726.30]  Having Jesus
[3726.30 --> 3727.52]  As the glorious king
[3727.52 --> 3728.16]  Of your life
[3728.16 --> 3730.32]  Is what you were created for
[3730.32 --> 3733.66]  Don't settle for anything less
[3733.66 --> 3735.08]  Amen
[3735.08 --> 3737.18]  Amen
[3737.18 --> 3739.12]  There's finally people here
[3739.12 --> 3739.50]  Amen
[3739.50 --> 3740.86]  Amen
[3740.86 --> 3741.38]  Thank you
[3741.38 --> 3742.14]  Let's pray together
[3742.14 --> 3745.64]  Lord Jesus
[3745.64 --> 3747.46]  You are king
[3747.46 --> 3748.36]  And so be
[3748.36 --> 3749.14]  Our
[3749.14 --> 3750.14]  King
[3750.14 --> 3753.76]  You came
[3753.76 --> 3754.40]  Lord God
[3754.40 --> 3756.22]  Not to be served
[3756.22 --> 3756.86]  But to serve
[3756.86 --> 3757.30]  And so
[3757.30 --> 3758.26]  Cause us
[3758.26 --> 3759.64]  To serve
[3759.64 --> 3763.40]  You came
[3763.40 --> 3763.96]  Lord God
[3763.96 --> 3764.70]  That we might
[3764.70 --> 3765.60]  Finally have
[3765.60 --> 3766.10]  Peace
[3766.10 --> 3767.20]  And joy
[3767.20 --> 3768.24]  And so make us
[3768.24 --> 3769.00]  A people of
[3769.00 --> 3769.40]  Peace
[3769.40 --> 3770.08]  And joy
[3770.08 --> 3770.94]  As we sing
[3770.94 --> 3771.72]  Your praises
[3771.72 --> 3772.34]  O king
[3772.34 --> 3774.96]  May we go
[3774.96 --> 3775.94]  From this place
[3775.94 --> 3777.34]  Emboldened
[3777.34 --> 3778.16]  In our
[3778.16 --> 3779.00]  Faith
[3779.00 --> 3780.18]  Together
[3780.18 --> 3782.52]  Captivate us
[3782.52 --> 3783.34]  By your love
[3783.34 --> 3784.46]  That we might lead
[3784.46 --> 3785.38]  Captivating
[3785.38 --> 3786.24]  Lives
[3786.24 --> 3786.94]  In the name
[3786.94 --> 3788.00]  Of Jesus Christ
[3788.00 --> 3788.58]  We pray
[3788.58 --> 3790.22]  Amen
[3790.22 --> 3790.26]  Amen
[3790.26 --> 3802.12]  We invite you to stand
[3802.12 --> 3802.90]  Whether you're here
[3802.90 --> 3803.48]  Or at home
[3803.48 --> 3818.04]  I see the king
[3818.04 --> 3819.64]  Of glory
[3819.64 --> 3823.60]  Coming on the clouds
[3823.60 --> 3825.34]  With fire
[3825.34 --> 3828.34]  The whole earth shakes
[3828.34 --> 3831.10]  The whole earth shakes
[3831.10 --> 3841.88]  I see his love and mercy
[3841.88 --> 3847.50]  Watching over all our sin
[3847.50 --> 3850.40]  The people sing
[3850.40 --> 3852.34]  The people sing
[3852.34 --> 3856.66]  Hosanna
[3856.66 --> 3857.36]  Hosanna
[3857.36 --> 3857.56]  Hosanna
[3857.56 --> 3859.58]  Hosanna
[3859.58 --> 3860.88]  Hosanna
[3860.88 --> 3861.78]  Hosanna
[3861.78 --> 3863.88]  In the highest
[3863.88 --> 3866.98]  Hosanna
[3866.98 --> 3868.70]  Hosanna
[3868.70 --> 3871.46]  Hosanna
[3871.46 --> 3873.76]  Hosanna
[3873.76 --> 3876.52]  In the highest
[3876.52 --> 3885.04]  I see a generation
[3885.04 --> 3891.00]  Rising up to take their place
[3891.00 --> 3894.10]  With selfless faith
[3894.10 --> 3896.76]  With selfless faith
[3896.76 --> 3902.32]  I see a near revival
[3902.32 --> 3908.36]  Starring as we pray and sing
[3908.36 --> 3911.36]  They're on our knees
[3911.36 --> 3915.00]  They're on our knees
[3915.00 --> 3920.42]  Hosanna, Hosanna
[3920.42 --> 3925.00]  Hosanna in the highest
[3925.00 --> 3932.12]  Hosanna, Hosanna
[3932.12 --> 3938.16]  Hosanna in the highest
[3938.16 --> 3952.16]  Fill my heart and make it clear
[3952.16 --> 3958.16]  Open up my eyes to the things unseen
[3958.16 --> 3963.20]  Show me how to love like you
[3963.20 --> 3966.20]  Have loved me
[3966.20 --> 3975.20]  Break my heart for what breaks yours
[3975.20 --> 3981.24]  Everything I am for your kingdom's good
[3981.24 --> 3988.24]  As I walk from earth into eternity
[3988.24 --> 3998.24]  Hosanna, Hosanna
[3998.24 --> 4008.28]  Hosanna, Hosanna
[4008.28 --> 4011.28]  Hosanna, Hosanna
[4011.28 --> 4014.28]  Hosanna in the highest
[4014.28 --> 4020.28]  Hosanna, Hosanna
[4020.28 --> 4030.32]  Hosanna, Hosanna
[4030.32 --> 4033.32]  Hosanna, Hosanna
[4033.32 --> 4038.32]  Hosanna in the highest
[4038.32 --> 4040.32]  Hosanna in the highest
[4040.32 --> 4044.36]  Hosanna in the highest
[4044.36 --> 4053.36]  Hosanna in the highest
[4053.36 --> 4058.36]  Hosanna in the highest
[4058.36 --> 4088.34]  Hosanna in the highest
[4088.36 --> 4118.34]  Hosanna in the highest
[4118.34 --> 4119.38]  See Palm Sunday
[4119.38 --> 4120.94]  We'll be able to see all that
[4120.94 --> 4122.26]  In fact there's already a few people
[4122.26 --> 4122.96]  Who have done that
[4122.96 --> 4124.18]  And so for those of you who have
[4124.18 --> 4125.20]  Thank you for that
[4125.20 --> 4127.96]  And take a look over the course of today
[4127.96 --> 4128.90]  And these next few days
[4128.90 --> 4131.70]  To see what we are sharing in together
[4131.70 --> 4134.46]  As you go I invite you to receive
[4134.46 --> 4136.88]  God's blessing for the journey of faith
[4136.88 --> 4137.88]  May God's blessing for the Lord
[4137.88 --> 4144.66]  May God go behind you to guard you
[4144.66 --> 4147.40]  May God go beneath you to support you
[4147.40 --> 4150.32]  And may God go beside you to befriend you
[4150.32 --> 4152.86]  Do not be afraid
[4152.86 --> 4155.60]  Let the blessing of God come upon you today
[4155.60 --> 4157.34]  Do not be afraid
[4157.34 --> 4163.22]  But go in peace to love and serve the Lord
[4163.22 --> 4164.62]  Amen
[4164.62 --> 4188.04]  Blessed be your name
[4188.04 --> 4192.16]  In a land that is plentiful
[4192.16 --> 4196.70]  Where your streams of abundance flow
[4196.70 --> 4200.20]  Blessed be your name
[4200.20 --> 4205.64]  Blessed be your name
[4205.64 --> 4209.94]  When I'm found in the desert place
[4209.94 --> 4213.70]  Though I walk through the wilderness
[4213.70 --> 4217.36]  Blessed be your name
[4217.36 --> 4219.36]  Blessed be your name
[4219.36 --> 4223.18]  Every blessing you pour out
[4223.18 --> 4228.04]  I'll turn back to praise
[4228.04 --> 4232.48]  When the darkness closes in, Lord
[4232.48 --> 4235.30]  Still I will say
[4235.30 --> 4239.54]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[4239.54 --> 4242.70]  Blessed be your name
[4242.70 --> 4243.86]  Blessed be your name
[4243.86 --> 4247.72]  Blessed be your name
[4247.72 --> 4255.94]  Blessed be your name
[4255.94 --> 4257.70]  Blessed be your name
[4257.70 --> 4259.84]  Blessed be your name
[4259.84 --> 4264.06]  When the sun's shining down on me
[4264.06 --> 4268.60]  When the world's all as it should be
[4268.60 --> 4271.98]  Blessed be your name
[4271.98 --> 4277.22]  Blessed be your name
[4277.22 --> 4281.04]  On the road marked with suffering
[4281.04 --> 4285.30]  Though there's pain in the offering
[4285.30 --> 4288.62]  Blessed be your name
[4288.62 --> 4294.50]  Every blessing you pour out
[4294.50 --> 4298.46]  I'll turn back to praise
[4298.46 --> 4303.60]  When the darkness closes in, Lord
[4303.60 --> 4306.42]  Still I will say
[4306.42 --> 4310.48]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[4310.48 --> 4313.96]  Blessed be your name
[4313.96 --> 4319.00]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[4319.00 --> 4324.32]  Blessed be your glorious name
[4324.32 --> 4328.10]  Give and take away
[4328.10 --> 4332.24]  You give and take away
[4332.24 --> 4337.24]  My heart will choose to say
[4337.24 --> 4341.06]  Lord, blessed be your name
[4341.06 --> 4345.32]  You give and take away
[4345.32 --> 4349.74]  You give and take away
[4349.74 --> 4353.88]  Your heart will choose to say
[4353.88 --> 4358.88]  But blessed be your name
[4358.88 --> 4363.88]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[4363.88 --> 4366.88]  Blessed be your name
[4366.88 --> 4373.02]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[4373.02 --> 4377.02]  Blessed be your glorious name
[4377.02 --> 4380.84]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[4380.84 --> 4385.24]  Let it be your name
[4385.24 --> 4390.66]  Let it be the name of the Lord
[4390.66 --> 4394.92]  Let it be your glorious name

[4467.12 --> 4473.12]  Now I'm lost in your freedom
[4473.12 --> 4481.12]  And this world I'll overcome
[4481.12 --> 4485.12]  My God's not dead, He's surely alive
[4485.12 --> 4489.12]  He's living on the inside, roaring like a lion
[4489.12 --> 4493.12]  God's not dead, He's surely alive
[4493.12 --> 4497.12]  He's living on the inside, roaring like a lion
[4497.12 --> 4499.12]  He's so dead, he's so dead
[4499.12 --> 4503.12]  He's roaring like a lion
[4503.12 --> 4511.12]  Let hope rise and make the darkness hide
[4511.12 --> 4517.12]  My faith is dead, I need a resurrection
[4517.12 --> 4519.12]  Somehow
[4519.12 --> 4521.12]  Somehow
[4521.12 --> 4527.12]  Now I'm lost in your freedom
[4527.12 --> 4533.12]  And this world I'll overcome
[4533.12 --> 4537.12]  My God's not dead, He's surely alive
[4537.12 --> 4541.12]  He's living on the inside, roaring like a lion
[4541.12 --> 4543.12]  God's not dead, He's surely alive

[4545.12 --> 4547.12]  He's roaring, he's roaring, he's roaring
[4547.12 --> 4559.12]  He's roaring, he's roaring
[4559.12 --> 4565.12]  Let heaven roar and fire fall
[4565.12 --> 4567.12]  Come shake the ground
[4567.12 --> 4569.12]  Come shake the ground
[4569.12 --> 4573.12]  With the sound of revival
[4573.12 --> 4579.12]  Let heaven roar and fire fall

[4591.04 --> 4595.04]  Let heaven roar and fire fall
[4595.12 --> 4597.12]  Come shake the ground
[4597.12 --> 4600.90]  Come shake the ground
[4600.90 --> 4603.04]  Let heaven roar and fire fall
[4603.10 --> 4604.04]  Come shake the ground
[4604.04 --> 4605.04]  Come shake the ground
[4605.04 --> 4607.04]  With the sound of revival
[4607.04 --> 4611.98]  You know God's not dead, He's surely alive
[4611.98 --> 4612.06]  He's living on the inside, roaring like a lion
[4612.06 --> 4614.44]  God's not dead, He's surely alive
[4614.44 --> 4626.44]  He's living on the inside, roaring like a lion. God's not there, he's surely alive. He's living on the inside, roaring like a lion.
[4626.44 --> 4648.82]  God's not there, he's surely alive. He's living on the inside, roaring like a lion. He's roaring, he's roaring like a lion.
