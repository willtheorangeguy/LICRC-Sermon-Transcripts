• The series is continuing on James and reading from James 1:12-18
• Temptation happens when we are dragged away by our own evil desires
• God does not tempt us to sin, but may bring about trials or tests of faith
• An important distinction between outer tests (God testing or proving) and inner temptation (our heart rebelling against God's design)
• Temptation itself is not sinful, but giving in to it leads to sin and death
• Faith is indicated by resisting temptation, not the infrequency of being tempted
• The goal is to get better at resisting temptation and not being deceived by things that pull our hearts.
• The speaker discusses how people often think about sin and temptation in terms of categories of what they can't do.
• Examples are given of individuals setting limits for themselves, such as eating only half a bag of chips or not taking money from their mother's wallet.
• This approach focuses on behavior rather than the right thing to do.
• The speaker argues that when we focus on what we can't do, we are making sin or behavior the goal of our actions.
• A paradigm shift is proposed: instead of focusing on what we can't do as sin, we should reframe it in terms of obedience.
• However, this is not the correct reframing; rather, we should consider something else entirely.
• The speaker argues that real faith is not ultimately about morality or behavior, but about a relationship with God.
• This is demonstrated by Jesus' teachings and behavior, who was critical of those who were hypocritically following religious rules.
• God is not interested in making people religious, spiritual, self-care obsessed, or serene; rather, He wants us to be passionate for Him and His glory.
• The concept of holiness is often misunderstood as moral behavior, but it's about being set apart by God
• God's holiness means he is wholly other, transcendent, and incomprehensible
• True faith thinks about what it means to be holy, not just what we can do
• Holiness involves new affections, desires, and motives that lead to new behavior
• We are already holy through Jesus' sacrifice and are being made holy in the process
• Reframing the conversation around sin and temptation through the gospel
• The power of God's word in salvation and sanctification
• Immerging oneself in Scripture for effective use of its power against temptation
• Community as a crucial factor in fighting temptation and applying the word
• The symbolism of Ash Wednesday and the imposition of ashes, illustrating how sin stains us unconsciously and grace cleanses us
• The importance of community and being with others when facing sin and temptation
• The tendency to "manicure" sins and present them in a socially acceptable way
• The reality of sin leading to death but the gift of God being eternal life
• The need for faith to be made real, which will involve facing challenges and trials
• Reframing discussions of sin and temptation through the lens of being holy
• The power and strength given by God's word to defeat sin and temptation
