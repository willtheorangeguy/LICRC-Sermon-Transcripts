[0.00 → 29.98] Thank you.
[30.00 → 59.98] Thank you.
[60.00 → 89.98] Thank you.
[90.00 → 119.98] Thank you.
[120.00 → 149.00] Thank you.
[150.00 → 179.98] Thank you.
[180.00 → 182.00] Thank you.
[210.00 → 212.00] Thank you.
[240.00 → 242.00] Thank you.
[270.00 → 272.00] Thank you.
[272.00 → 274.00] Thank you.
[274.00 → 276.00] Thank you.
[276.00 → 278.00] Thank you.
[278.00 → 280.00] Thank you.
[280.00 → 286.00] Thank you.
[286.00 → 288.00] Thank you.
[288.00 → 290.00] Thank you.
[290.00 → 292.00] Thank you.
[292.00 → 294.00] Thank you.
[294.00 → 296.00] Thank you.
[300.00 → 306.00] Thank you.
[306.00 → 312.40] Out of the darkness into your glorious day.
[313.90 → 321.30] You called my name and I ran out of that grave.
[323.30 → 329.40] Out of the darkness into your glorious day.
[336.00 → 365.98] Out of the darkness into your glorious day.
[366.00 → 368.56] You were my healing.
[368.98 → 371.26] Now your love is healing.
[371.52 → 372.86] I'm breathing.
[373.34 → 375.02] I have a future.
[375.56 → 377.28] My eyes are open.
[377.72 → 380.88] Cause when you called my name shining.
[381.76 → 384.44] I ran out of that grave.
[386.82 → 393.08] Out of the darkness into your glorious day.
[393.08 → 401.86] You called my name and I ran out of that grave.
[403.86 → 410.66] Out of the darkness into your glorious day.
[410.66 → 413.54] Oh, come on!
[418.00 → 418.94] Come on!
[418.94 → 429.72] Oh, what a day
[429.72 → 432.00] Oh, what a day
[432.00 → 434.14] Oh, what a day
[434.14 → 436.42] Oh, what a day
[436.42 → 439.96] You call my name
[439.96 → 442.50] I keep running out of that grave
[448.94 → 452.38] 2017, let's hear it
[452.38 → 454.06] The loudest shout you've got in you
[454.06 → 455.06] Give it to us
[455.06 → 455.38] Come on
[478.94 → 494.72] There's a grace when the heart is under fire
[494.72 → 500.94] Another way when the walls are closing in
[500.94 → 507.24] And when I look at the space between
[507.24 → 509.24] Where I used to be
[509.24 → 510.66] And this reckoning
[510.66 → 515.32] I know I will never be alone
[515.32 → 519.38] There was another in the fire
[519.38 → 522.90] Standing next to me
[522.90 → 526.92] There was another in the waters
[526.92 → 530.28] Holding back the seas
[530.28 → 533.62] And should I ever need reminding
[533.62 → 537.04] Of how I've been set free
[537.04 → 540.76] There is a cross that bears the burden
[540.76 → 544.14] Where another died for me
[544.14 → 547.86] There is another in the fire
[560.28 → 562.90] I know my death
[562.90 → 562.92] I know my death
[562.92 → 566.20] If I dip beneath the waters
[566.20 → 573.18] I'm no longer a slave to my sin anymore
[573.18 → 578.42] Should I fall in the space between
[578.42 → 580.34] What would mean to me
[580.34 → 581.82] And this reckoning
[581.82 → 584.16] Either way
[584.16 → 586.00] Either way I will bow to the things
[586.00 → 587.40] Of this world
[587.40 → 593.30] And I know I will never be alone
[593.30 → 597.76] There is another in the fire
[597.76 → 601.06] Standing next to me
[601.06 → 605.28] There is another in the waters
[605.28 → 608.42] Holding back the seas
[608.42 → 611.76] And should I ever need reminding
[611.76 → 615.10] The power set me free
[615.10 → 616.52] There is another in the fire
[616.52 → 618.52] There is another in the fire
[618.52 → 620.86] There is another in the fire
[620.86 → 623.28] There is another in the fire
[623.28 → 625.28] There is another in the fire
[625.28 → 629.30] Oh, did I ever need to reacher
[629.30 → 631.58] And some extra if I unite
[631.58 → 633.42] And I can render and turn
[633.42 → 634.28] Just like we've been set free
[634.28 → 634.56] And going now
[634.56 → 634.72] Clyde is to live
[634.72 → 635.68] There is another in the fire
[635.68 → 636.28] And I can see
[636.28 → 636.96] It's a compromise
[636.96 → 637.76] such I am setting out
[637.76 → 638.20] The power set me priority
[638.20 → 638.46] God and protection
[638.46 → 642.76] And Gustav
[642.76 → 647.54] I can definitely change
[647.54 → 648.34] And your life
[648.34 → 649.70] servile
[649.70 → 650.70] Your life
[650.70 → 651.44] Sam
[651.44 → 651.64] Ah
[651.64 → 652.70] You
[652.70 → 656.64] I can see the light in the darkness
[656.64 → 659.58] As the darkness miles to Him
[659.58 → 663.84] I can hear the roar in the heavens
[663.84 → 666.64] As the space between the west end
[666.64 → 670.90] I can feel the crowd shaking beneath us
[670.90 → 673.98] As the prison walls cave in
[673.98 → 677.34] Nothing stands between us
[677.34 → 681.70] Nothing stands between us
[682.70 → 701.18] There is no other name but the name that is Jesus
[701.18 → 707.84] He who was and still is and will be through it all
[707.84 → 716.08] Good morning and welcome to church.
[716.36 → 719.86] My name is Chris, and thank you for joining with us this morning
[719.86 → 722.08] either here in person or at home.
[723.16 → 726.46] We're going to start this morning with a bit of an update and an announcement
[726.46 → 730.54] and I think we've got a video that we're going to kick to in order to get that going.
[730.54 → 749.02] Good morning and welcome to this morning's edition of the 10am Emanuel Emissions Committee News.
[749.18 → 750.44] I'm your host Rebecca Pullman.
[751.06 → 756.92] Our top story today is regarding the results of the exciting food drive that took place on June 12.
[756.92 → 761.92] Live on location we have Nikki Robert who has an exclusive interview with the winning district.
[762.42 → 763.34] Nikki, over to you.
[763.88 → 764.62] Thanks Rebecca.
[765.04 → 769.14] I'm reporting live from the winning district elders house now.
[769.60 → 771.04] You can see it right here behind me.
[771.40 → 775.42] He doesn't know that we're here so we're going to go in and surprise him with the prize.
[775.76 → 776.62] Come on and follow me.
[777.12 → 777.44] Let's go.
[777.44 → 800.34] All right, let's knock on the door and see if he answers.
[800.34 → 800.44] Let's go.
[800.44 → 800.50] Let's go.
[807.44 → 808.44] Anybody home?
[810.72 → 811.28] Maybe.
[813.10 → 814.24] Knock again.
[816.00 → 816.56] Hi.
[817.04 → 817.36] Hello.
[817.86 → 822.54] Hello, I'm here from the Emanuel Emissions Committee, and I'm looking for a Mr. Frank Helping.
[822.76 → 823.52] You are?
[823.80 → 824.36] Okay.
[824.72 → 825.36] Just a moment.
[826.12 → 827.32] Mr. Frank Helping.
[827.54 → 830.52] All right guys, it looks like the person we need is in the house.
[830.52 → 835.40] Let's see if we can surprise him with our winning district prize.
[837.44 → 841.42] All right.
[841.52 → 841.92] Hello.
[842.62 → 843.18] Hi Ruby.
[843.86 → 844.26] Hi.
[845.72 → 848.30] That's Isla, my special camera reporter.
[848.52 → 849.54] Your special camera?
[849.54 → 854.44] You are live on camera right now, and I am here on behalf of the Emanuel Emissions Committee
[854.44 → 860.72] News, and we are here to present you, come on up prize presenter, as the winning district
[860.72 → 863.24] from the Emanuel Food Challenge.
[863.96 → 865.40] Go ahead and pass him his prize.
[865.54 → 866.42] Thank you.
[866.42 → 871.36] Now I did something as I made a special sign for the winning district, and after I watched
[871.36 → 875.88] the news report last week, it seemed fairly obvious that district six thought they were
[875.88 → 876.12] winning.
[876.28 → 879.04] So I missed and made the sign a little bit too soon.
[879.24 → 880.08] Now it's upside down.
[881.16 → 884.18] It says district six.
[884.18 → 886.72] Well, I crossed that out and I put district two.
[886.72 → 890.14] They are the official food drive champion.
[890.34 → 890.96] So congratulations.
[891.32 → 894.24] Do you have any words of celebration?
[894.78 → 900.56] Well, the real winners are the food bank, and we thank everybody who participated in it.
[900.62 → 901.42] It was awesome.
[901.80 → 903.00] It was great fun doing it.
[903.00 → 908.64] And I really appreciated all the help and everything that was we received for the food bank.
[909.14 → 909.82] Thank you.
[909.82 → 910.70] All right.
[910.70 → 911.58] There you have it folks.
[911.70 → 912.86] We have district two winners.
[913.08 → 917.56] You know who has your prize now, and you can bug him to find out how you can take part in
[917.56 → 917.78] that.
[918.18 → 919.56] And we'll go back to you, Rebecca.
[919.78 → 920.30] Thank you.
[921.28 → 921.68] Wow.
[921.78 → 922.38] Thank you, Nikki.
[922.38 → 923.94] What an exciting competition.
[924.66 → 929.42] Special thanks to all of those who contributed to the food bank through the food drive last
[929.42 → 929.82] weekend.
[930.42 → 934.40] We'll conclude our report today with a montage of the highlights of the food drive that took
[934.40 → 935.38] place on June 12th.
[936.42 → 938.60] Special thanks to everyone again for contributing.
[939.34 → 941.34] Thank you for tuning into our newscast today.
[941.64 → 944.92] I'm Rebecca Pullman and from all of those at IMC, have a great day.
[952.38 → 966.44] We all start on the outside, the outside looking in.
[967.22 → 969.54] This is where grace begins.
[972.24 → 978.36] We were hungry, we were thirsty, with nothing left to give.
[979.14 → 981.64] Oh, the shape that we were in.
[982.38 → 983.42] We're hungry, we're hungry, we're hungry, we're hungry, we're hungry, we're hungry.
[983.42 → 984.56] We're hungry, we're hungry, we're hungry, we're hungry, we're hungry, we're hungry, we're hungry.
[984.56 → 999.82] And just when all hope seemed lost, love opened the door for us, he said, come to the table.
[1001.44 → 1006.56] Come join the sinners who have been redeemed.
[1006.56 → 1011.56] Take your place beside the Saviour.
[1012.38 → 1016.62] Sit down and be set free.
[1017.84 → 1020.38] Come to the table.
[1020.38 → 1035.06] Come meet this mighty crew of misfits.
[1035.06 → 1037.70] These liars and these thieves.
[1037.70 → 1040.80] There's no one unwelcome here.
[1040.80 → 1046.94] And that sin and shame that you brought with you.
[1046.94 → 1055.08] And so indeed, congratulations to District 2.
[1055.58 → 1057.64] Just throwing that out there, but that's my district.
[1058.48 → 1059.22] Good work.
[1060.22 → 1065.82] Very excited to share the news with you, that update, and then also to participate as a community
[1065.82 → 1067.74] in that event together.
[1067.88 → 1071.72] It was a real blessing, not only for us here, but also for Langley Food Bank.
[1071.72 → 1074.56] Also, just a note.
[1074.56 → 1082.56] We will be looking for, are looking for, a children's worship time coordinator or a children's
[1082.56 → 1084.32] worship time coordinator team.
[1084.48 → 1089.46] Mrs. Nikki, who is currently doing that, has the opportunity to go back to school in the
[1089.46 → 1089.72] fall.
[1089.92 → 1092.72] And so she's going to pull back from some of those responsibilities.
[1093.02 → 1097.54] And so we're looking for someone or a couple of people to step into that responsibility.
[1097.54 → 1101.50] And so if God's putting that on your heart, or if you're looking for a way to serve in the
[1101.50 → 1105.50] church, we want to encourage you to prayerfully think about this and then to reach out either
[1105.50 → 1110.12] to myself or Pastor Kevin or Mrs. Nikki, just to see what that might be like and how you might
[1110.12 → 1113.48] be able to serve us in that time together.
[1114.86 → 1119.92] Of course, if I haven't said it yet, I want to say happy Father's Day to all of you fathers.
[1120.88 → 1123.00] Thank you for being here with us this morning.
[1123.00 → 1128.04] I don't see any homemade ties or particularly new socks yet this morning.
[1128.40 → 1131.58] And that's only because my kids weren't really awake when I left this morning.
[1131.60 → 1133.66] So I haven't gotten my Father's Day gift either.
[1133.80 → 1138.48] But thank you for you and for who you are in our fellowship.
[1138.68 → 1144.92] And then also for those of you who are missing fathers or who have struggled relationships with
[1144.92 → 1149.74] your fathers or who wish you could be fathers, know that our hearts and our prayers are with
[1149.74 → 1155.52] you on this day as well, as these days can be particularly hard for those of us in that
[1155.52 → 1156.00] opportunity.
[1157.52 → 1164.76] And then lastly, just a note that there is no real talk, which is scheduled for Monday,
[1164.96 → 1165.26] tomorrow.
[1165.66 → 1166.56] That has been cancelled.
[1167.32 → 1168.52] There's just a lot going on.
[1168.58 → 1171.38] It's the last week of school for many of our youth.
[1171.38 → 1176.78] And so we want to say congratulations to you as coming to the last week and to teachers
[1176.78 → 1177.80] and staff and schools.
[1177.94 → 1178.94] Congratulations to you.
[1179.04 → 1182.02] You've made it through June, which can be an awful time in school.
[1182.26 → 1183.72] And so good work on that.
[1183.82 → 1185.24] But there is no real talk.
[1185.34 → 1186.12] That's the implication.
[1186.84 → 1188.16] We're going to worship our God together.
[1188.24 → 1192.50] And so where you are, I'm going to invite you to stand as we can receive God's greeting
[1192.50 → 1193.42] together.
[1193.58 → 1198.80] And so if it helps, you can take a posture of receipt, hands out, eyes lifted as these
[1198.80 → 1204.00] words of God are spoken over you, and he draws you to himself in worship this morning.
[1205.52 → 1212.76] Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God, our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son,
[1213.02 → 1216.78] and our Saviour through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[1217.96 → 1218.36] Amen.
[1219.02 → 1220.32] Let's worship God together this morning.
[1223.08 → 1225.60] Good morning and welcome to worship this morning.
[1225.82 → 1226.68] Happy Father's Day.
[1226.68 → 1230.52] Our call to worship is from Psalm 134.
[1231.20 → 1236.60] Come, bless the Lord, all you servants of the Lord, who stand by the night in the house
[1236.60 → 1237.24] of the Lord.
[1237.82 → 1240.44] Lift your hands to the holy place and bless the Lord.
[1241.04 → 1244.32] May the Lord bless you from Zion, he who made heaven and earth.
[1244.32 → 1244.44] Amen.
[1244.44 → 1244.54] Amen.
[1244.54 → 1246.44] Amen.
[1246.44 → 1247.44] Amen.
[1247.44 → 1248.44] Amen.
[1248.44 → 1248.94] Amen.
[1248.94 → 1249.44] Amen.
[1249.44 → 1250.44] Amen.
[1250.44 → 1251.44] Amen.
[1251.44 → 1252.44] Amen.
[1252.44 → 1253.44] Amen.
[1253.44 → 1253.50] Amen.
[1253.50 → 1254.50] Amen.
[1254.50 → 1254.58] Amen.
[1256.68 → 1280.00] Amen.
[1280.00 → 1280.92] Amen.
[1280.92 → 1281.26] Amen.
[1285.26 → 1285.78] Amen.
[1285.78 → 1295.20] Oh, just to bring something that's at work that will bless your heart.
[1297.06 → 1306.86] I'll bring you more than a song, for a song in its love is not what you have required.
[1306.86 → 1320.82] You search much deeper within, through the way things appear, you're looking into my heart.
[1322.82 → 1335.70] I'm coming back to the heart of worship, and it's all about you, it's all about you, Jesus.
[1335.70 → 1348.86] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made, and it's all about you, it's all about you, Jesus.
[1348.86 → 1378.86] 
[1378.86 → 1392.06] I'll bring you more than a song, for a song in itself is not what you have required.
[1392.06 → 1406.06] You search much deeper within, through the way things appear, you're looking into my heart.
[1406.06 → 1420.06] I'm coming back to the heart of worship, and it's all about you, it's all about you, Jesus.
[1420.06 → 1433.92] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made, and it's all about you, it's all about you, Jesus.
[1433.92 → 1447.12] I'm coming back to the heart of worship, and it's all about you, it's all about you, Jesus.
[1447.12 → 1460.84] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made, and it's all about you, it's all about you, Jesus.
[1460.84 → 1490.82] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made, and it's all about you, Jesus.
[1490.82 → 1497.82] The things we hold onto that we believe bring us worth, when truly it is all about you.
[1499.50 → 1506.76] Jesus, bring us back to when we do, when what we do is because we are compelled in love of you,
[1507.76 → 1513.92] in worship, in praise, and even when we are in a time of our life when we don't know how to praise you,
[1513.92 → 1517.36] when our circumstances, our minds, our relationships are in turmoil.
[1517.72 → 1522.76] Give us the faith to believe you are still good, and your promises still ring true.
[1523.92 → 1526.76] This is our desire, to honour you, Lord.
[1526.92 → 1530.64] Bring us to our knees when we forget to surrender every day to you.
[1531.90 → 1533.58] In your name we pray, amen.
[1533.58 → 1533.66] Amen.
[1533.66 → 1563.64] piano plays softly
[1563.66 → 1593.64] piano plays softly
[1593.66 → 1595.66] piano plays softly
[1595.66 → 1599.66] Lord, I give you my heart
[1600.18 → 1602.66] I give you my soul
[1603.30 → 1605.66] I live for you
[1606.52 → 1609.66] Oh, Lord, every breath that I take
[1610.44 → 1613.66] Every moment I'm awake
[1613.66 → 1617.66] Lord, have your way in me
[1617.66 → 1625.66] This is my desire
[1625.66 → 1631.66] To honour you
[1631.66 → 1635.78] Lord, with all the heart
[1635.78 → 1637.66] I worship you
[1637.66 → 1645.66] All I have within you
[1645.66 → 1650.66] I give you praise
[1650.66 → 1657.66] All that I adore is in you
[1657.66 → 1664.66] Lord, I give you my heart
[1664.66 → 1667.66] I give you my soul
[1667.66 → 1671.66] I live for you alone
[1671.66 → 1674.66] Every breath that I take
[1674.66 → 1677.66] Every moment I'm awake
[1677.66 → 1681.66] Lord, I love your way in me
[1681.66 → 1684.66] Lord, I give you my heart
[1684.66 → 1687.66] I give you my soul
[1687.66 → 1691.66] I live for you alone
[1691.66 → 1694.66] Every breath that I take
[1694.66 → 1697.66] Every moment I'm awake
[1697.66 → 1702.66] Lord, my glory in me
[1702.66 → 1722.66] You could have
[1732.66 → 1745.98] Hello, good morning and welcome to Kids' Corner. My name is Mr. Mike and I have the privilege
[1745.98 → 1752.58] of sharing a story and a lesson with you today. But first, Happy Father's Day to all
[1752.58 → 1758.22] the dads, the grandpas, the dad-like people in our lives. I hope you guys did something
[1758.22 → 1763.44] special for them today, or maybe you still have plans to do something special. Either way,
[1763.84 → 1770.16] Happy Father's Day. Also, before we get into our lesson, let's go over our memory verse
[1770.16 → 1775.20] this month. And that's going to be brought to us by some special helpers. So let's see
[1775.20 → 1775.66] that now.
[1776.66 → 1787.34] Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and
[1787.34 → 1797.06] with all your strength, and the second is like it. Love your neighbour as yourself. There's
[1797.06 → 1805.56] no commandment greater than these. Mark 12, verse 30 to 31.
[1808.14 → 1814.32] Great job on that memory verse, guys. Thanks. So, okay, I don't know if you've noticed, but
[1814.32 → 1819.26] I'm not in the church today. I'm here on location in front of this special building.
[1820.34 → 1823.72] I don't know. Can you make out where I am? Can you guess? Maybe you've seen this place
[1823.72 → 1831.40] before. Any guesses? That's right. I'm in front of the Langley RCMP building, the Langley
[1831.40 → 1837.22] Police Station. Hey, how many of you have ever thought of becoming a policeman or a police
[1837.22 → 1841.42] woman in your life? Put your hands up. Yeah? I've thought about it before. When I was a
[1841.42 → 1845.44] kid, I thought, oh yeah, that would be a pretty cool job to have. What kind of things do the
[1845.44 → 1851.94] police do? Can you think of any? They keep us really safe. And how is that? They enforce
[1851.94 → 1858.50] laws. They make sure people drive the right speed, even though sometimes we don't. Furthermore, they
[1858.50 → 1864.86] protect us. They keep our communities safe. All those wonderful things. It's quite a privilege
[1864.86 → 1870.10] to live in Canada, isn't it? A place where our police force loves us and encourages us
[1870.10 → 1876.86] and especially lets us be Christians. Let us go to church. Let us praise God. Let's
[1876.86 → 1881.16] us do all those awesome things we can do on Sunday and throughout the rest of the week.
[1882.02 → 1889.24] Well, hey, today's story and lesson comes from the book of Acts. And it's another story about
[1889.24 → 1894.60] Paul. We've been learning about Paul in the last couple of weeks, I think, right? And he's
[1894.60 → 1900.94] had some crazy, crazy experiences. And you know what? He didn't always have the privilege
[1900.94 → 1910.86] of being in situations or places or with enforcement people that let him live out his faith and share
[1910.86 → 1915.68] his love for God and share God's love for everybody else.
[1915.68 → 1921.40] Okay, so I've just come inside so we can talk a little bit more about today's story about Paul.
[1922.60 → 1927.66] And look where I find myself. Can you guess where I am? It's a bit confusing with our little fox
[1927.66 → 1933.88] friend here, but I'm at the bottom of my staircase. That reminds me of a special spot. We were just
[1933.88 → 1941.58] talking about the police and how they protect us. But what's another thing sometimes police have to do?
[1941.58 → 1947.90] Sometimes when people get out of line, or they're not able to follow laws properly, they have to put
[1947.90 → 1954.42] people in jail. That may be a hint of what today's story is a little is a bit about. And we've got our
[1954.42 → 1960.38] friend Fox here kind of illustrating sometimes how hard that can be. And this spot on the staircase
[1960.38 → 1966.24] kind of reminds me of something that maybe you've experienced. When I was growing up, we had a spot
[1966.24 → 1973.30] called the timeout spot for times when we wouldn't finish our dinners, or when we wouldn't listen to
[1973.30 → 1980.68] mom or dad properly. And we had to take some time out to think about what we've done. In some ways,
[1980.72 → 1987.12] it's a little bit like jail. Have you ever had to be in a timeout? Or detention maybe at school?
[1987.94 → 1993.40] And you know, it can make those moments feel even harder is when it feels like the punishment was not
[1993.40 → 1999.04] fair or was not deserved. Right? I'm sure we've had those moments where there were misunderstandings.
[1999.98 → 2006.86] And yet, we learn to still have to respect our authority and make the most of those moments.
[2007.40 → 2014.92] So let's go to today's story. Let's see what happened to Paul and how God used him to make the most
[2014.92 → 2017.32] of what seemed like not a great situation.
[2017.32 → 2028.66] All right, so let's check out today's story. It comes from Acts chapter 16, verse 24 to 34.
[2030.40 → 2036.86] Earthquake in prison. Some people did not like Paul and his friend Silas preaching about Jesus.
[2037.82 → 2044.58] One day they were thrown into prison. But they were not worried. They knew God would take care of them.
[2044.58 → 2054.50] That night, God sent an earthquake. It shook so hard that all the prison doors opened and all the
[2054.50 → 2062.70] prisoners' chains fell off. The guard thought everyone had escaped. He was terrified.
[2062.70 → 2076.12] Paul told the guard, do not worry. We are still here. The guard was amazed. He invited the two men to his house.
[2078.12 → 2087.04] The guard and his family learned about Jesus and decided to follow him. The next day, Paul and Silas left to tell more people about Jesus.
[2087.04 → 2093.24] What an incredible story, hey? So Paul and Silas were sharing about the love of God.
[2094.40 → 2101.36] And the authorities did not agree. Or maybe they just didn't understand. But it got them thrown into prison.
[2101.36 → 2112.18] And even a big earthquake came and shook the walls apart. And the jailer was freaked out because he thought all the prisoners would escape.
[2112.68 → 2117.28] But Paul and Silas respected the decision that was made and stayed in prison.
[2118.22 → 2123.18] And even because of it, they were able to share the love of God with the jailer.
[2123.18 → 2131.74] And in the end, Paul and Silas were able to go free and continue sharing the story of God's love to all kinds of people.
[2132.92 → 2137.52] And actually, I chose this shirt today specifically to go with this story.
[2137.98 → 2142.48] You probably can't read what it says on there. It's designed kind of cool like.
[2142.66 → 2146.30] But it's from a youth event, and it says, unashamed.
[2146.92 → 2149.28] Do you know what that word means? Kind of a big word.
[2149.28 → 2156.28] But it means to not be embarrassed or to not hide something that you know you should be proud of.
[2156.56 → 2160.28] Kind of like Paul and Silas, right? They were not ashamed of their faith.
[2160.36 → 2162.74] They were not ashamed to share the love of God.
[2162.92 → 2164.58] And we should be inspired to do the same.
[2165.00 → 2169.34] We should be inspired to respect the decisions sometimes made for us.
[2169.70 → 2175.88] But in that, not be ashamed of God's love for us and the story that he wants us to share.
[2176.08 → 2179.16] So let's close in prayer, and we'll pray about that very soon.
[2179.28 → 2184.22] Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for this story.
[2184.42 → 2189.00] We thank you so much that you stepped in and provided for Paul and Silas.
[2189.16 → 2191.84] And that we can know that story and be encouraged by it.
[2192.20 → 2194.04] And we pray for the same in our lives.
[2194.18 → 2196.24] We pray that we would always respect our authorities.
[2196.70 → 2201.98] But also to not be ashamed of your love for us and the story that you want us to share.
[2202.48 → 2205.68] We pray for your Holy Spirit to give us that strength.
[2206.18 → 2207.18] In your name, amen.
[2209.28 → 2210.84] Nice to see you guys again this week.
[2211.20 → 2211.96] Have a good week.
[2211.96 → 2211.98] Have a good week.
[2211.98 → 2221.16] All right.
[2221.22 → 2226.64] It is such a privilege to be up here today to take part in this chunk of this service.
[2226.64 → 2232.64] Right now we are going to witness two of our young people profess their faith to this church.
[2232.76 → 2234.52] And of course, most importantly, to Christ.
[2234.68 → 2237.06] And so we are going to take part in that today.
[2237.14 → 2238.20] We're going to have two of them come up.
[2238.20 → 2239.44] They will share testimonies.
[2239.80 → 2243.38] They will have a spiritual mentor come up and share a little bit on their behalf as well.
[2243.74 → 2247.42] And then Pastor Chris will come forward and lead us through the rest of the profession of faith.
[2247.50 → 2251.88] So without further ado, I'm going to invite up Kiera Hummel man.
[2252.00 → 2252.98] She's going to come up for it.
[2252.98 → 2256.32] And actually her mentor, Heather, you can come and stand up here as well.
[2256.32 → 2258.32] So Kiera Hummel man, here she comes.
[2258.40 → 2259.40] And we are about to hear her story.
[2259.40 → 2259.44] Thank you.
[2259.44 → 2259.50] Thank you.
[2259.50 → 2259.56] Thank you.
[2259.56 → 2261.50] Thank you.
[2261.50 → 2261.56] Thank you.
[2261.56 → 2263.50] Thank you.
[2263.50 → 2263.56] Thank you.
[2263.56 → 2264.50] Thank you.
[2264.50 → 2265.56] Thank you.
[2265.56 → 2266.56] Thank you.
[2266.56 → 2267.56] Thank you.
[2267.56 → 2268.18] Thank you.
[2268.20 → 2269.20] Thank you.
[2271.20 → 2272.54] Hi, I'm Kiera.
[2273.68 → 2278.34] I'm so blessed to have been able to grow up in a Christian home and be surrounded by the church family
[2278.34 → 2280.78] as well as attend a Christian school my entire life.
[2281.38 → 2285.10] This has probably been the biggest thing in my life that's helped me grow my faith journey
[2285.10 → 2287.04] and grow closer with God.
[2287.82 → 2290.46] My parents have been the biggest role models in my life.
[2290.82 → 2294.14] They have helped me grow and learn, and they have had a big influence on me.
[2294.74 → 2297.06] They have taught me how to trust God when things get hard
[2297.06 → 2299.16] and how to show God in everything I do.
[2299.16 → 2302.22] I am so thankful for the impact that they have had on me.
[2302.22 → 2307.98] This church has also given me many opportunities for me to grow, specifically in trip settings,
[2307.98 → 2313.24] like the Mexico Mission's trip and the youth conference in Edmonton, both being highlights
[2313.24 → 2315.06] and have challenged me in my faith journey.
[2315.06 → 2317.84] Youth has also been a great learning tool for me.
[2317.84 → 2322.26] I've gained insight from 2020 nights, and talks with Heather have been really impactful.
[2323.60 → 2326.98] Graduating and moving on from LCS, I plan to take all I have learned
[2326.98 → 2329.90] and use it to continue to grow my relationship with the Lord.
[2329.90 → 2341.84] I'm kind of nervous now.
[2344.34 → 2345.20] It's been a while.
[2348.50 → 2350.02] I just love Kira.
[2350.02 → 2357.72] I went out with her a week or so ago, and she shared her testimony with me,
[2357.82 → 2362.20] and I realized that I have a very similar testimony to her.
[2362.68 → 2369.34] And I think because we have so much in common, we just made a really special bond over the last five years.
[2369.92 → 2374.46] So I've had the privilege of being Kira's youth leader for the past five years.
[2374.46 → 2376.64] I feel like time really flies.
[2377.34 → 2381.28] I could not be more honoured to stand up here with her today.
[2382.38 → 2386.38] One of my favourite things about Kira is her thoughtfulness of others.
[2387.04 → 2392.48] Since grade eight, I've been blown away at how she would always ask me how I'm doing
[2392.48 → 2394.80] before I had a chance to ask her.
[2395.48 → 2398.58] And that's huge, especially, like, in grade eight.
[2398.58 → 2402.26] It just shows that you have just a big heart for other people.
[2404.46 → 2407.12] Yeah, you just have a huge heart, Kira, and it's really beautiful.
[2409.54 → 2417.60] I'd like to share with you a devotion that I really love and has really encouraged me in the past.
[2418.28 → 2424.04] The devotional that it's from is called Come Away, My Beloved by Francis Roberts.
[2424.24 → 2428.16] I did paraphrase it a bit because I was told I had to keep this kind of not too long.
[2428.16 → 2436.00] The specific devotion that I like is called I Want to Do a Beautiful Work.
[2438.44 → 2442.56] He is a chosen vessel to bear my name, Acts 9, verse 15.
[2443.60 → 2444.66] You are mine, Kira.
[2445.48 → 2448.22] With a great price, I have purchased you for myself.
[2448.22 → 2457.56] I say that if you listen to me, I will reveal myself to you more fully so that you will know more clearly how vital you are to my purpose.
[2458.18 → 2462.64] There is a work to be done, and I need you as a vessel through which to work.
[2463.38 → 2465.18] I want to do a beautiful work.
[2466.20 → 2466.58] So, yeah.
[2467.02 → 2471.30] As you go forward, keep listening to the Lord's voice and just keep doing his work.
[2471.80 → 2474.10] You're amazing, Kira, and I'm so proud of you, and I love you.
[2474.34 → 2475.58] And God has huge plans for you.
[2475.58 → 2475.62] Thank you.
[2475.62 → 2475.68] Thank you.
[2478.22 → 2484.44] And I want to hug you.
[2489.20 → 2489.56] Awesome.
[2489.68 → 2490.16] Thank you, Kira.
[2490.26 → 2490.72] Thank you, Heather.
[2490.92 → 2492.82] I'm going to invite Ethan Spoor up as well.
[2492.90 → 2498.12] He's going to share a little bit about his story and what brought him to this moment of professing his faith today.
[2504.24 → 2504.64] Hi.
[2504.64 → 2505.36] I'm Ethan.
[2505.36 → 2506.36] I'm Ethan.
[2506.36 → 2510.48] A verse that has stuck with me over the past few years is Joshua 1 verse 9, which says,
[2510.68 → 2511.40] Be strong and courageous.
[2511.58 → 2512.24] Do not be terrified.
[2512.40 → 2513.22] Do not be discouraged.
[2513.76 → 2515.98] For the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.
[2515.98 → 2521.26] As many of you know, three years ago, I broke my ankle and developed complex regional pain syndrome.
[2521.80 → 2525.24] As a result, I could not walk for nearly two years as I was in severe pain.
[2525.82 → 2532.46] During this time, it was also very challenging for me to go to school, hang out with friends, and do regular everyday things that most people take for granted.
[2532.46 → 2538.62] This was a discouraging situation, but this verse was able to remind me that God was with me even in this really challenging time.
[2539.28 → 2542.72] It reminded me to be strong and persevere through all the physical therapy I had to go through.
[2544.04 → 2550.12] Through this time, I was also able to see God's love through the church community as well as my family as many people were praying for me and encouraging me.
[2550.76 → 2553.56] With God's help, I was able to work hard and overcome this injury.
[2554.12 → 2556.06] Today, I am, as you can tell, able to walk.
[2556.70 → 2563.34] I've been able to attend university at Redeemer in Ontario, and I can do everything I was able to do before my injury, which at the time looked very unlikely.
[2564.20 → 2566.96] I know that no matter what challenges I face in life, God will be with me.
[2567.38 → 2570.02] So that is why I am here today to profess my faith and love for God.
[2570.02 → 2600.00] Thank you.
[2600.02 → 2630.00] Thank you.
[2630.02 → 2633.14] It talks a lot about the quality and character of man that you are.
[2633.28 → 2635.46] And so Philippians 2, verses 1 to 4 says this.
[2636.10 → 2636.30] It says,
[2636.30 → 2666.28] It says,
[2666.28 → 2670.20] This is very fitting today, too, Ethan, because Paul, of course, he's speaking to an entire church.
[2670.32 → 2677.84] And so he's telling them not to look to their own interests, but to the interests of others, to show love to one another, to be compassionate, to be humble.
[2678.44 → 2680.24] And you are all those things, Ethan.
[2680.30 → 2681.24] You are a humble man.
[2681.32 → 2682.08] You are compassionate.
[2682.24 → 2683.16] You're a loving guy.
[2683.16 → 2684.72] And I'm so happy to see you.
[2684.72 → 2692.40] And I'm so happy to see you up here today, committing yourself to Christ and professing your faith to this community of believers in front of us here in this church, but also who are watching online right now.
[2692.40 → 2705.60] And my encouragement to you is to take the character traits that God has created in you, this loving, compassionate, humble man that he's created you to be, and to serve this body and serve ultimately Christ well.
[2705.60 → 2714.22] And while this encouragement is for you today, Ethan, on your profession of faith, it's also for all of us here today watching, too, for everybody online and here today.
[2714.42 → 2718.92] May you, Ethan, show this church love, compassion, and mercy.
[2719.14 → 2728.68] And as well, church, may we show both Kira and Ethan the same love, compassion, and mercy as we walk this road of life and be church together.
[2728.68 → 2730.26] So I love you, man.
[2730.40 → 2732.64] Thank you for doing this, and congratulations today.
[2733.64 → 2734.06] All right.
[2734.10 → 2737.20] I'm going to invite Pastor Chris up to continue this profession of faith.
[2737.26 → 2739.16] And actually, I'm going to invite Kira up as well.
[2739.22 → 2740.84] You can stand sort of here.
[2741.26 → 2744.64] Ethan, you can stand a little closer to the microphone here so that we can hear your voices.
[2752.76 → 2754.28] Do we need Kira to move?
[2755.54 → 2756.08] You're good?
[2756.26 → 2756.62] All right.
[2756.62 → 2759.08] I want to make sure everyone at home can see, right?
[2759.16 → 2760.06] Otherwise, what's the point?
[2761.54 → 2769.46] So as a relatively new pastor in this community, I say relatively because it's seven months still new.
[2769.58 → 2772.24] I don't know, but it kind of feels like it because this is new.
[2772.36 → 2773.34] Being together is new.
[2773.48 → 2782.84] So anyway, I am incredibly grateful for a community of faith that has surrounded its young people and its disciples
[2782.84 → 2785.68] and has provided mentors for them.
[2785.68 → 2789.06] Prior to this experience, I didn't know you guys.
[2789.14 → 2795.62] I still don't really know you guys, but I know your mentors, and I trust this community and this process.
[2795.62 → 2802.68] And it is beautiful to see the way that God has worked in your lives and in this community to bring you to this day.
[2802.68 → 2807.02] And I'm so excited for you and for what this means for us.
[2807.02 → 2816.48] You see, at their baptisms, we made a promise to be used of God to help get them to this day.
[2816.48 → 2820.12] Today, we see that promise fulfilled.
[2820.12 → 2826.06] And that is a beautiful testimony of God's faithfulness to his church.
[2826.42 → 2829.56] And you guys are that beautiful picture today.
[2829.56 → 2834.50] And, so thank you for letting us be part of that.
[2836.10 → 2839.14] To do this well, I'm going to ask you guys some questions.
[2839.78 → 2844.98] And in fact, there are going to be four questions that will involve you professing your faith.
[2845.30 → 2850.50] And then we're going to ask the church a question as they make another promise to you on this day.
[2850.50 → 2855.20] And so I'm going to ask all four questions, and then I will ask you individually what your answers are.
[2855.36 → 2857.12] But I'm actually going to move over here.
[2857.38 → 2860.92] And when it comes time to answer, you can speak into that microphone.
[2860.92 → 2863.82] And that way, all the people at home can hear you as well.
[2864.18 → 2864.42] Cool?
[2865.02 → 2865.38] All right.
[2866.12 → 2868.10] So, Ethan and Kira.
[2869.10 → 2874.46] Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God sent to redeem the world?
[2875.02 → 2878.32] Do you love and trust him as the one who saves you from your sin?
[2878.32 → 2882.56] And do you, with repentance and joy, embrace him as Lord of your life?
[2883.72 → 2888.58] Do you believe that the Bible is the word of God revealing Christ and his redemption?
[2889.36 → 2893.38] And that the confessions of this church faithfully reflect his revelation?
[2894.86 → 2900.14] Do you accept the gracious promises of God sealed to you in your baptism?
[2900.42 → 2906.58] And do you affirm your union with Christ and his church, which your baptism signifies?
[2906.58 → 2921.06] And fourth, do you promise to do all you can with the help of the Holy Spirit to strengthen your love and commitment to Christ by sharing faithfully in the life of this church, honouring and submitting to its authority?
[2921.40 → 2926.82] And do you join with the people of God in doing the work of the Lord everywhere?
[2927.58 → 2931.52] Ethan, because you're closest to the microphone, what is your response?
[2931.96 → 2932.34] I do.
[2932.44 → 2933.12] God helping me.
[2933.62 → 2933.88] Amen.
[2934.68 → 2935.80] Roll out of the pocket.
[2935.80 → 2936.28] Beautiful.
[2937.42 → 2939.30] Kira, what is your response?
[2940.02 → 2940.46] I do.
[2940.58 → 2941.32] God helping me.
[2941.70 → 2942.18] Amen.
[2943.86 → 2951.88] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I now welcome you into the full privileges of communion in the church.
[2952.28 → 2958.46] I welcome you to full participation in the life of the church, to its responsibilities, its joys, and its sufferings.
[2958.46 → 2970.94] May the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead, our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, equip you with everything good for doing his will.
[2970.94 → 2979.38] And may he work in us, what is pleasing to him through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever.
[2979.90 → 2980.24] Amen.
[2980.24 → 2980.32] Amen.
[2982.20 → 2985.34] Here, I'm going to get you to stand here and Ethan over here.
[2987.10 → 2989.64] Congregation, this is your turn now.
[2990.60 → 2992.00] Ethan, take two steps that way.
[2992.50 → 2993.00] There you go.
[2993.00 → 2998.74] I'm going to invite you to stand as you also make a promise to them.
[2998.80 → 3006.62] I'm going to ask you a question, and if you agree with the promise implied, that you would also respond with, we do, God helping us.
[3006.96 → 3010.44] People at home, I encourage you to do this as well.
[3010.44 → 3022.90] Do you, people of God, here at Langley Emanuel Church, promise Ethan and Kira your love, encouragement, and prayers?
[3023.38 → 3024.22] What is your answer?
[3027.74 → 3028.26] Amen.
[3028.86 → 3030.68] I'm going to invite Ken to come forward.
[3030.78 → 3035.48] He has a gift for each of you and a certificate to mark this occasion.
[3035.48 → 3040.96] And there are names, so be specific.
[3042.30 → 3045.46] Although, if you can't, they can read, I'm sure of it, so they could also trade.
[3051.66 → 3059.38] Now, ordinarily, in a time like this, we would invite people to come forward and lay hands on you.
[3060.22 → 3063.56] Now, because of COVID regulations, we're going to do that a little bit differently.
[3063.56 → 3074.08] And so, if you are part of their household bubbles, and you're here this morning, would you come to the front and represent all of us by laying your hands on them as I pray for them?
[3074.18 → 3076.54] And so, start walking.
[3076.80 → 3082.74] I know that at least four of you from each household are here, so if there are more household bubbles, come on up.
[3083.60 → 3085.16] Stand beside Ethan and Kira.
[3085.28 → 3086.32] Lay your hands on them.
[3086.32 → 3095.64] And for the rest of us, if you would be so inclined, you can extend your hand as a sign of the Spirit working through each of us as we pray together.
[3097.42 → 3098.08] Let's pray.
[3101.96 → 3105.02] Lord, our good God,
[3105.02 → 3112.02] we thank you for your word and spirit through which we know Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour.
[3114.64 → 3120.96] May Ethan and Kira, who confessed your name today, never cease to wonder at what you have done for them.
[3122.40 → 3124.84] Help them to continue firmly in the faith,
[3125.42 → 3130.08] to bear witness to your love, and to let the Holy Spirit shape their lives.
[3130.08 → 3137.98] Take Ethan and Kira, good shepherd, into your care that they may loyally endure opposition to serving you.
[3139.06 → 3144.98] And may we, with all your children, live together in the joy and power of your Holy Spirit.
[3146.06 → 3153.06] We ask this and for your blessing on them today, Lord Jesus, in the hope of your coming.
[3153.98 → 3155.96] In Christ's name we pray.
[3156.92 → 3157.34] Amen.
[3157.34 → 3157.38] Amen.
[3158.50 → 3159.06] Amen.
[3160.82 → 3164.48] Let's give them a round of applause as we welcome them into the fellowship of our church.
[3168.30 → 3170.70] We can invite the worship team to come back up.
[3172.18 → 3176.96] Ethan and Kira have requested a song for us to worship through, and we will do that now.
[3177.08 → 3181.36] You may remain standing or sit if you need to as we come in worship.
[3181.36 → 3181.44] Amen.
[3190.08 → 3191.06] Thank you.
[3191.06 → 3199.16] Thank you.
[3202.52 → 3215.96] Thank you.

[3347.10 → 3353.02] Every heart, I worship you

[3418.62 → 3420.62] Even when I don't feel that you're working
[3420.62 → 3422.62] You never stop, you never stop working

[3426.62 → 3440.54] You never stop, you never stop working

[3446.54 → 3452.54] You never stop, you never stop working
[3452.54 → 3466.46] You never stop, you never stop working

[3538.46 → 3546.20] We will continue our worship at this time
[3546.20 → 3547.90] By the giving of our offerings
[3547.90 → 3550.68] The offerings for today are for our church budget
[3550.68 → 3552.86] Which supports all the ministries
[3552.86 → 3555.74] And everything to do with our church
[3555.74 → 3558.12] And the second offering
[3558.12 → 3559.42] The special offering for today
[3559.42 → 3561.08] Is for World Renew Canada
[3561.08 → 3565.60] World Renew Canada is a part of the CRC denomination
[3565.60 → 3570.20] It is not directly supported by the CRC as such
[3570.20 → 3573.20] Other than through churches and through individual offerings
[3573.20 → 3578.68] Under the umbrella it has a disaster response section
[3578.68 → 3583.08] Refugee resettlement, world hunger response, community development and more
[3583.08 → 3586.68] It also partners with the World Food Grains Bank and other ministries
[3586.68 → 3592.52] World Renew says that it is compelled by God's deep passion for justice and mercy
[3592.52 → 3598.44] And joins communities around the world to renew hope, reconcile lives and restore creation
[3598.44 → 3603.28] As the Lord commanded in Deuteronomy 16 verse 17
[3603.28 → 3608.92] Each of you must bring a gift in proportion to the way the Lord has blessed you
[3608.92 → 3611.42] Therefore, give as you have been given

[3765.48 → 3770.14] price of our sin in our place so that the light of life may be put upon us even if
[3770.14 → 3776.34] we can't see it hold on to each person who struggles to see that light make them

[3941.84 → 3946.32] pastor Chris to speak boldly and clearly the words you want to teach us
[3946.32 → 3950.24] father we pray all these things in Jesus name amen
[3950.24 → 3964.88] we're going to open up god's word in mark 3
[3964.88 → 3969.36] I'm going to read a few verses from the end of that chapter starting at verse 31
[3970.40 → 3974.96] through the end and so if you've got a bible handy I encourage you to open that up and keep it open
[3974.96 → 3980.72] with you if you've got it uh it will be on the screen but uh better in your hands in whatever form that
[3980.72 → 3987.36] that takes um at home as well if you have a bible encourage you to grab that or turn it on or whatever
[3987.36 → 3992.96] and go to mark 3 starting in verse 31 this is god's word to us this morning
[3992.96 → 4001.20] Jesus mother and brothers arrived standing outside they sent someone in to call him
[4002.56 → 4008.08] a crowd was sitting around him, and they told him your mother and brothers are outside looking for you
[4009.04 → 4017.92] who are my mother and my brothers he asked then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said
[4017.92 → 4027.12] here are my mother and my brothers whoever does god's will is my brother and sister and mother
[4028.08 → 4029.12] this is the word of the lord
[4033.92 → 4042.64] now um in the providence of the holy spirits working uh this sermon text for this Sunday was picked before
[4042.64 → 4047.92] a profession of faith, although there is direct and immediate application to it, and it was picked
[4047.92 → 4053.44] independent of my realization that it was also one Father's Day and so that's just uh perhaps
[4053.44 → 4059.04] fortuitous or if you are looking for something about fathers in particular, and you're disappointed in
[4059.04 → 4065.52] that I'm sorry talk to me afterwards I'm happy to handle your disappointment I do want to say before we
[4065.52 → 4072.56] go in however that this is the kind of sermon that has a lot of maze and mites in it and what I mean by
[4072.56 → 4079.44] that is that it is going to require a little bit of introspection on your part as you look in your own
[4079.44 → 4086.24] heart and your own life and so your work is application and discernment here mine is just to open the door and
[4086.24 → 4094.80] invite you to wonder, and so I encourage you to do that and to let the spirit do that as we reflect on these words of Jesus
[4095.52 → 4103.28] together now what we will see in this text of course is that Jesus is providing his disciples
[4103.28 → 4111.28] and us as his disciples two thousand years later with a new definition of family rooted in a new life
[4111.84 → 4120.32] of obedience and so if Jesus is giving us a new definition that must mean there is an old or another
[4120.32 → 4130.16] definition in our culture today it seems to me that there's sort of two operating understandings of
[4130.16 → 4136.48] family and that family relationship and for some of us and this is true in the church but also outside
[4136.48 → 4144.16] of the church for some of us family is everything right family defines who you are family is most important
[4144.16 → 4149.20] these are my people everything i do for them
[4149.20 → 4155.84] right, and it's in this category of understanding of family as everything as definitional to who we are
[4155.84 → 4163.28] where you start to talk about things like traditional family values or family as the centre of society and
[4163.28 → 4171.20] on and on and on and on and this has a particular expression that comes out in the church often right
[4171.20 → 4178.72] the idea turns into this reality that you are not complete until you have a family
[4178.72 → 4187.76] right this has the implication of devaluing singles and singleness in our communities which in turn
[4187.76 → 4193.44] might then build to the idea that you're not a full functioning member of the community or society or
[4193.44 → 4200.24] church until you're married and have kids right sometimes our ideas of adulthood are connected to being
[4200.24 → 4206.16] married and having a family, and we might never say it so explicitly but in function and practice we say
[4206.16 → 4211.04] you're not really adults until you hit this marker or that marker or whatever the case may be
[4213.12 → 4222.24] now on the other side of the spectrum is an idea of family that says family limits me right that in order
[4222.24 → 4229.84] to be fully me I need to be rid of my family's influence and the identity imposed on me because of them and
[4229.84 → 4236.08] in this way of thinking and being in the world family is an obstacle that needs to be overcome on the
[4236.08 → 4244.96] way to personal and authentic identity this is where we begin to talk about individual values or
[4244.96 → 4255.04] individual rights replacing and overwhelming family values now the danger here is the breakdown
[4255.04 → 4263.04] of family and broken marriages and broken relationships here the consequence can be feelings of animosity or jealousy or victimization
[4263.04 → 4266.56] the consequence of the situation because these people are holding you back
[4268.48 → 4276.88] now in some way both of these ideas are operating in our cultural moment both in our sort of 21st
[4276.88 → 4285.92] century western society but also in our 21st century church cultural moment now there are sorts of healthy
[4285.92 → 4293.84] expressions of both of these right the family is incredibly influential in shaping who you are and who you will
[4293.84 → 4301.84] become and the responsibility of parents for instance is to raise healthy independent adults people who can stand
[4301.84 → 4310.40] on their own right and the point is that dependents become independent and regardless of how long that takes for some of us that is the goal
[4310.40 → 4323.04] the goal, but these good expressions also have manifestations that are more idolatrous and that more ultimate in our lives
[4323.04 → 4332.08] right when your hope for life becomes marriage and kids you've turned a good thing into an ultimate thing
[4332.08 → 4343.36] when your idea of uh when your idea is that finally being free of these people or these structures or these systems will mean I'm actually free
[4343.36 → 4355.04] we've we've put our hope into some other idea or idol than Jesus right we've made idols of family and systems either positively or negatively
[4355.04 → 4365.76] what I hope we can see this morning is that neither of these things is what Jesus says about family and neither of these things are what the bible teaches
[4366.96 → 4375.12] Jesus redefines family for his day and for ours and he makes it about more than biology right more than psychology
[4375.12 → 4383.92] family isn't just a social construct to be cast off, but it also isn't the ultimate source of your identity and purpose in society
[4383.92 → 4392.00] now let me be clear right, and we'll start at the beginning here with a sort of biblical theology of family because family is a good thing
[4392.00 → 4400.56] it's a created good it's designed in the creation of god at which he looks and says this is very good
[4401.36 → 4406.64] and so real quick I'm going to throw a couple bible passages in front of you so we can tie this story together
[4406.64 → 4414.56] genesis 1 all the way back in the beginning god created mankind in his own image in the image of god he created
[4414.56 → 4423.36] them male and female he created them and then genesis 2 god adds to that story or zooms in on the role of
[4424.08 → 4429.84] humans and says for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will
[4429.84 → 4438.96] become one flesh god looked at his creation, and it was very good and part of god's very good creation
[4438.96 → 4446.40] is marriage and family god charged Adam and eve be fruitful and multiply that means have families
[4449.12 → 4455.60] marriage between a man and a woman is good and part of god's intent and design for the beauty of his
[4455.60 → 4462.16] creation right and then dig a little deeper there are a lot of uh words that the bible has to say about
[4462.16 → 4468.80] respecting your family about honouring your parents but not exasperating your children and providing
[4468.80 → 4475.76] for your children exodus 20 right in the 10 commandments right god says to the people of Israel
[4475.76 → 4481.28] honour your father and your mother so that you may live long in the land the lord your god is giving you
[4481.28 → 4488.64] Colossians 3 children obey your parents in everything for this pleases the lord first
[4488.64 → 4494.32] timothy anyone who does not provide for their relatives especially for their own household has
[4494.32 → 4502.88] denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever the bible knows and gets the importance of family
[4502.88 → 4508.88] for a person's upbringing and for their faith formation right in Deuteronomy 6 we read impress them
[4508.88 → 4514.16] that's the commandments of god on your children talk about them when you sit at home and when you
[4514.16 → 4520.40] walk along the road and when you lie down and when you get up proverbs 22 right trains a child in the
[4520.40 → 4527.76] way he should go and when he is old he will not turn from it and so let me be really, really clear the
[4527.76 → 4534.72] family the biological family is a created structure it is a normative sphere of authority and the flourishing
[4534.72 → 4540.40] of the family is in fact closely linked to the well-being of society family is meant to be the first
[4540.40 → 4546.88] context in which people that is primarily children learn about god that is all true
[4549.04 → 4556.64] but there's also our text right where Jesus says who are my mother and my brothers
[4558.08 → 4563.60] right there's also Jesus words when he says whoever does god's will is my brother and sister
[4563.60 → 4572.40] and mother there's also a text in Luke 14 right where Jesus says if anyone comes to me and does not
[4572.40 → 4578.64] hate his father and mother his wife and his children his brothers and sisters yes even his own life he
[4578.64 → 4586.96] cannot be my disciple in the same way any of you who does not give up everything he has cannot be my
[4586.96 → 4600.48] my disciple what on earth is Jesus talking about this morning welcome to the tension we're going to walk in this
[4601.44 → 4601.92] tension
[4604.40 → 4612.40] now the context of Jesus remarks in what we read has to be understood and has to be considered out of verse 21
[4612.40 → 4618.40] and so if your bibles are still open look at mark 3 verse 21 where we read
[4619.52 → 4626.00] when his family heard about this they went to take charge of him for they said he is out of his mind
[4632.00 → 4636.96] now the word used for take charge in our translation or if you're reading from another translation
[4636.96 → 4646.56] uh it might say sees him um that word is most often translated as arrest right and so their plan
[4646.56 → 4654.40] is for more than just to slip him out the back door right they are ashamed they are scared and they
[4654.40 → 4657.92] are concerned about public opinion, and so they're going to put him away
[4657.92 → 4665.60] right that's part of the context that we need to understand still in the context in verse 32 right
[4665.60 → 4672.16] which we did read and says your mother and your brothers are outside looking for you and in
[4672.16 → 4679.76] another translation it says seeking you now in the Gospel of Mark in particular this Greek word that's
[4679.76 → 4686.24] translated looking for you or seeking you has a different use than just the know casually looking for
[4686.24 → 4692.56] uh in mark almost every single time that this word is used except for one in mark 16 it has a sense
[4692.56 → 4700.56] of seeking to destroy or a seeking to arrest or to test or to kill or to betray right this isn't the
[4700.56 → 4707.04] sort of seeking that you get in Matthew when uh Jesus says seek first the kingdom of god or when Jesus
[4707.04 → 4711.52] says ask, and it will be given to you seek, and you will find knock and the door will be open to you
[4711.52 → 4718.56] this isn't that kind of seeking in fact this is the opposite of that sort of seeking right his family
[4719.20 → 4725.04] his mother and his brothers are at cross purposes to Jesus mission and to the father's will
[4726.64 → 4733.36] now understanding that and knowing that Jesus knows that helps us make sense of his words then
[4733.36 → 4739.76] especially at the end of his text in verse 35 where Jesus says whoever does the will of god is my brother
[4739.76 → 4745.68] and sister and mother you see because what Jesus is doing is redefining family
[4747.84 → 4753.92] and that would have been just as shocking in Jesus day as it is today although maybe for different
[4753.92 → 4761.76] reasons because in Jesus day whether you are in Jewish Palestine or in the broader Roman Empire right
[4761.76 → 4771.28] uh family is the basis of social and economic and religious life in the Roman world actually the
[4771.28 → 4779.04] head of the family the patter families ruled the life of all his dependents and slaves and free persons
[4779.04 → 4787.92] attached to their domes their household adult children even would remain under his authority until he died
[4787.92 → 4792.88] he ran the business and economic life he determined the religious practices and commitments of the
[4792.88 → 4799.84] household the family was the source of your identity and status and so there it mattered who your father was
[4801.60 → 4808.72] in Jewish households this is also true in fact it's even heightened right when sons got married and moved
[4808.72 → 4815.60] out like they would in response to genesis 2 moving out really usually only meant building a house
[4815.60 → 4821.52] structure right next door to mom and dad and probably even sharing a wall like a modern day duplex but
[4821.52 → 4829.44] just one eighth the size right the sleeping areas would sort of be off to the side, and they would be moved
[4829.44 → 4836.08] around but then each of those separate family houses would be built around a shared courtyard or an open
[4836.08 → 4842.56] air centre that sometimes would have tarps over the top to block the sun right throughout the Old Testament
[4842.56 → 4847.84] the role and importance of family as we've seen is highlighted in fact in the Old Testament the word
[4848.48 → 4857.60] life is almost always used interchangeably with the word family your family was your life and to reject
[4857.60 → 4864.72] your family or to be rejected by them was to lose your life now understanding that helps us understand this
[4864.72 → 4870.16] context it also helps us understand the parable of the prodigal son a little bit as well right
[4870.16 → 4878.56] your family is your identity your status and your life and in some ways right in our own world that
[4878.56 → 4888.08] finds ways to continue on there's a story that was reported on a few years ago a woman named Gloria jams
[4888.64 → 4895.36] she was arrested for slapping a valet at a hotel who took too long to bring her car around
[4896.32 → 4902.24] now according to the valet when she slapped him she shouted do you know who I am
[4903.84 → 4907.52] and so do you know who she is you know who Gloria jams is anyone
[4909.52 → 4917.20] Gloria jams is LeBron James's mother how many of you know who that is right super famous basketball
[4917.20 → 4922.96] player playing for the Lakers he's got four championships four MVPs four finals MVP awards he's
[4922.96 → 4929.84] a 17-time NBA all-star player three-time NBA all-star MVP he's got two Olympic gold medals and a bronze
[4929.84 → 4937.68] medal Gloria acted as if her son's fame her son's special status gave her privilege
[4939.76 → 4944.00] now most of us would probably never say something and I trust that that is true for you too right we
[4944.00 → 4952.16] would probably never say do you know who I am, but we all struggle with presuming certain allegiances
[4952.16 → 4959.36] to different families than the blood bought by grace through faith family that Jesus has placed us in
[4959.36 → 4970.64] here if sports are more important than gathering with your blood-bought brothers and sisters you may be
[4970.64 → 4972.32] living out of the wrong idea of family
[4974.64 → 4979.28] if you believe that having children will finally give you meaning and purpose you may be living out
[4979.28 → 4987.04] of the wrong idea of family if your regular practice is to not include others and outsiders
[4987.04 → 4991.36] and here's one specific to the church because after church on Sunday you're going to go have
[4991.36 → 4998.16] lunch with your family you may be living out of the wrong idea of family if you think that someone
[4998.16 → 5003.84] isn't fit to lead in the church or isn't a fully grown mature responsible adult until they are married
[5003.84 → 5011.12] and have kids you are living out of the wrong idea of family and if you're first or if your only question
[5011.12 → 5017.28] to young people is when are you going to get married or if your first or only question to young couples is
[5017.28 → 5021.28] when are you going to have kids you may be living out of the wrong idea of family
[5025.52 → 5034.64] at the beginning of the third century in roughly 203 a.d there's a woman her name is perpetual
[5034.64 → 5042.00] and she is a married noble woman just 22 years old she lives in Carthage which is part of north
[5042.00 → 5050.64] Africa in the Roman Empire by all accounts she is one of the privileged elites she is converted to
[5050.64 → 5061.12] Christianity because of a slave in her house named Felicia now perpetual and Felicia are eventually
[5061.12 → 5067.68] arrested and imprisoned for refusing to offer sacrifices to the emperor at that time in
[5067.68 → 5075.36] in history uh sacrifices to the emperor and worshipping the emperor was used as a test to find Christians
[5075.36 → 5083.92] out right so that they could be either persecuted or even killed she refused to do that and so she
[5083.92 → 5090.96] along with Felicia were arrested now uh during that time we have memoirs recorded from
[5090.96 → 5097.52] her, and she recounts the time that her father came to her while she was in prison, and he pleaded with
[5097.52 → 5106.00] her to recant, and she told him look I can't be anything other than whom I am a Christian she writes
[5106.00 → 5111.84] in her memoirs that her father was so angry at the word Christian that he moved towards me as though to
[5111.84 → 5120.80] pluck out my eyes, and then he begs her she writes this she records his speech she says that her
[5120.80 → 5127.52] dad said to her daughter have pity on my gray head have pity on me your father if I deserve to be
[5127.52 → 5133.04] called your father if I have favoured you above your brothers if I have raised you to reach this prime of
[5133.04 → 5137.92] your life do not abandon me to the reproach of men think of your brothers think of your mother and
[5137.92 → 5143.84] your aunt think of your children who will not be able to live while you are gone give up your pride you
[5143.84 → 5149.92] will destroy us all none of us will ever be able to speak freely again if anything happens to you do
[5149.92 → 5156.48] you hear what he's doing he is trying to use family and the social pressures that come with this idea
[5156.48 → 5162.56] with this idolatry of family to get her to change from her newfound faith in Jesus
[5162.56 → 5171.92] she rejects his plea saying in the final letter that we have from her that she found a new family
[5172.80 → 5182.48] and that felicitous has become her sister they died in each other's arms as sisters in the faith
[5182.48 → 5191.36] Jesus redefines family, and it's not about your blood it's about his
[5193.68 → 5201.36] this is what profession of faith means this is what profession of faith does Ethan and Kira are saying
[5201.36 → 5208.56] I am part of this family right when their mentors speak and give testimony of their faith we are living
[5208.56 → 5215.20] into and out of this new idea of family because you see gospel family is bigger and more beautiful
[5215.20 → 5219.04] than even genetic family no matter how beautiful your genetic family may be
[5219.92 → 5225.60] Jesus redefines family, and he makes it about relationship to each other a relationship that
[5225.60 → 5232.16] is marked by obedience to god whoever does god's will is my brother and sister and mother
[5232.16 → 5241.36] in fact this is how Paul puts it in Romans 8 Romans 8 14 Paul says for all who are led by the spirit of
[5241.36 → 5248.88] gods are sons and daughters of god you have received the spirit of adoption as sons and daughters by whom we
[5248.88 → 5261.04] cry abba father we are children of god you are part of a new family if by grace through faith you believe
[5262.16 → 5266.80] and so as we wrap this up this morning I want you to think about this
[5268.88 → 5275.44] when you talk to people about your faith when you invite your neighbours to faith or co-workers or
[5276.08 → 5286.08] friends or colleagues whoever when you invite people to faith you are not inviting people primarily to church
[5286.08 → 5294.40] that is to come to this service you're not inviting people into a primarily intellectual conversation
[5295.36 → 5303.28] although both of those are part of it you are inviting people into a new family you are inviting
[5303.28 → 5312.24] people into a relationship to god that means a relationship to brothers and sisters you are inviting
[5312.24 → 5318.48] people into a community of faith that is so much bigger than biology right it's about justification
[5318.48 → 5324.96] and sanctification it's about communion at the cross with Jesus and with each other you are inviting
[5324.96 → 5336.88] people into a new experience of family into a new family we are a family closer to each other because of
[5336.88 → 5345.28] Jesus than we are to our unbelieving biological brothers and sisters and parents and kids we are perpetual and felicitous
[5347.44 → 5354.48] and it's my prayer that as Jesus redefines family for us as he calls us to lives of obedience that with
[5354.48 → 5362.00] ever-increasing measure we would be this family of god that we would become more and more that family
[5362.00 → 5370.16] that the love that we share in broken and attempts and full of mistakes would be the overwhelming
[5370.16 → 5377.92] experience for us all whether they come to this church or live next to you in your neighbourhoods or
[5377.92 → 5388.40] hear from you at work or in school it is my prayer that through us and with us, you would know this new family
[5388.40 → 5400.40] brothers and sisters Ethan and Kira welcome to the family amen let's pray together
[5404.00 → 5407.28] lord Jesus you make us new
[5410.64 → 5415.92] you make us new by taking our hearts of stone and turning them into hearts of flesh
[5415.92 → 5426.88] you make us new creations by taking us out of our being dead in sin and trespasses and giving us new life
[5426.88 → 5434.24] and you make us new by granting us new brothers and sisters a new family
[5437.44 → 5439.04] lord Jesus may we
[5439.04 → 5451.20] see see see for the first time or for a renewed time the vision of family that you have for us in the church
[5452.80 → 5459.20] and so come what may as brothers and sisters may we go together
[5459.20 → 5473.20] may we go in the power of your spirit in Jesus Christ we pray amen
[5473.20 → 5479.20] so
[5479.20 → 5483.20] so
[5483.20 → 5493.20] is
[5501.20 → 5502.20] so
[5502.20 → 5508.28] I've heard a thousand stories of life
[5508.28 → 5511.48] They've been your life
[5511.48 → 5514.72] But I've been to you
[5514.72 → 5517.00] And I swear to love
[5517.00 → 5520.74] In the dead of my eyes
[5520.74 → 5522.72] And I've been to you
[5522.72 → 5524.82] And I've been to you
[5524.82 → 5526.82] And I've been to you
[5526.82 → 5528.82] And I've been to you
[5528.82 → 5558.80] And I've been to you
[5558.82 → 5560.82] And I've been to you
[5560.82 → 5562.82] And I've been to you
[5562.82 → 5564.82] And I've been to you
[5564.82 → 5567.82] Dear, oh, Susan, for instance
[5568.48 → 5572.02] Only you broke my because
[5572.02 → 5575.50] You just got me
[5575.50 → 5577.32] And before me
[5577.32 → 5579.82] Stay alone
[5579.82 → 5581.82] Come on, come on
[5581.82 → 5583.82] Come on, come on
[5583.82 → 5585.82] To you, Father
[5585.82 → 5587.82] To you, Lord
[5587.82 → 5589.82] To you, Lord
[5589.82 → 5592.82] I love for you
[5592.82 → 5600.82] Perfect.
[5622.82 → 5638.10] you
[5652.82 → 5658.00] And I'll walk away to God.
[5661.52 → 5665.60] Love so unbeknownst,
[5665.60 → 5670.44] I can hardly speak.
[5670.96 → 5675.60] He's so unexplainable,
[5675.60 → 5682.18] I can hardly think as you call me.
[5682.18 → 5687.18] Keep us still as you call me.
[5687.18 → 5691.18] Keep us still as you call me.
[5691.18 → 5695.18] Keep us still in the heart.
[5695.18 → 5699.18] Love so unbeknownst,
[5699.18 → 5702.18] I can hardly speak.
[5702.18 → 5706.18] To you all, to you all,
[5706.18 → 5710.18] to you all in my love,
[5710.18 → 5713.18] I feel so unbeknownst,
[5713.18 → 5715.16] and to you all, to you all.
[5715.18 → 5717.18] We've got one more line.
[5717.18 → 5719.18] I feel so unbeknownst,
[5719.18 → 5721.18] and we've got one more line.
