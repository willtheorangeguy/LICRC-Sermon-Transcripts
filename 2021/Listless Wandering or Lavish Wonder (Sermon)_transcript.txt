[0.00 --> 14.80]  This morning we are continuing in our series looking at the book of Habakkuk.
[15.26 --> 20.94]  And before I read, and we're going to read this morning from Habakkuk 2, starting at verse 2 through the end of the chapter.
[20.94 --> 32.50]  Before I read, let me just say I really appreciate everyone's engagement and comments and conversations that are started that come out of these messages.
[33.56 --> 43.22]  But let me also say I was really surprised how in a sermon on the problem of evil and the sovereignty of God, even in the face of that last week,
[43.28 --> 48.06]  the most controversial thing I said was how to pronounce Habakkuk.
[48.06 --> 57.62]  Even this morning, someone sent me a text of a YouTube video that supposedly tells you how to properly say it, and the YouTube video is wrong.
[58.10 --> 58.68]  Sorry, Clary.
[63.28 --> 70.42]  Point is, I do appreciate the engagement and the chance to have these sorts of follow-up conversations,
[70.42 --> 73.38]  especially in times like this and this season.
[73.38 --> 78.12]  We don't get that in the same way, and so I do cherish it.
[78.76 --> 86.10]  So I want to invite you to grab a Bible, maybe grab a notebook, whatever the case may be, to help you in our engagement this morning.
[86.88 --> 90.70]  We're going to read from Habakkuk 2, starting at verse 2.
[90.70 --> 100.84]  Now, before I begin, maybe this is your first time joining us, or you forgot already what we covered last week,
[100.88 --> 103.98]  but just a quick recap about Habakkuk.
[104.46 --> 111.54]  Habakkuk is a prophet in Judah before the people of God are taken by the Babylonians into exile.
[112.94 --> 118.10]  Habakkuk is living and writing sometime around 600, 605 BC.
[118.10 --> 125.74]  Now, the Babylonians, who once acted as Israel's allies, have now turned against them,
[125.74 --> 132.42]  and in fact, as we saw last week, are being used by God to bring judgment on Israel and Judah
[132.42 --> 136.92]  because the ways that they have acted not of God.
[136.92 --> 144.00]  So Habakkuk sees the injustice and evil that is happening globally with foreign oppressors and war,
[144.00 --> 152.26]  and Habakkuk sees injustice and evil happening locally with abuses of power and poverty and selfishness
[152.26 --> 158.46]  as the political and religious leaders of his day aren't acting faithfully in obedience to God.
[158.46 --> 168.38]  Now, the book of Habakkuk is set up for us as a poetic dialogue between the prophet and God.
[168.38 --> 177.66]  And it goes back and forth between what some have called, and maybe your Bibles call it as the editors have put headings in places,
[178.16 --> 182.82]  back and forth between Habakkuk's complaints and then God's responses.
[182.82 --> 192.50]  Today, I'm going to read God's response to Habakkuk's second complaint.
[193.54 --> 200.52]  Now, Habakkuk, if you recall, has just balked at the idea that God would use an evil people, the Babylonians,
[200.62 --> 204.20]  to publish a lesser evil, the people of Judah.
[204.80 --> 207.78]  And Habakkuk doesn't understand why in the midst of that,
[207.78 --> 212.58]  that God would appear to be silent and let bad things happen to good people.
[213.38 --> 217.98]  That was the digging and exploring and thinking we did last week.
[218.06 --> 221.28]  You can check on the YouTube channel if you want to find that.
[222.30 --> 225.82]  Now, Habakkuk is pretty brazen in his complaint, right?
[225.86 --> 230.08]  He finishes his second complaint by saying effectively, and I'm paraphrasing him here,
[230.14 --> 230.42]  he's saying,
[230.42 --> 231.42]  I'm here, God.
[232.02 --> 232.84]  I'm waiting.
[233.10 --> 234.22]  I'm not going anywhere.
[234.50 --> 235.30]  I will wait.
[235.74 --> 236.82]  You answer.
[238.36 --> 241.12]  What we're going to read is God's answer.
[242.00 --> 243.26]  Let me read it with you.
[245.26 --> 246.66]  The Lord replied,
[248.26 --> 253.96]  Write down the revelation and make it plain on tablets so that a herald may run with it.
[254.84 --> 258.12]  For the revelation awaits an appointed time.
[258.12 --> 261.68]  It speaks of an end and will not prove false.
[262.46 --> 265.38]  Though it linger, wait for it.
[265.98 --> 268.64]  It will certainly come and will not delay.
[270.20 --> 272.32]  See, he is puffed up.
[272.40 --> 277.78]  His desires are not upright, but the righteous will live by his faith.
[278.94 --> 280.82]  Indeed, wine betrays him.
[280.90 --> 282.64]  He is arrogant and never at rest.
[282.94 --> 287.12]  Because he is as greedy as the grave and like death is never satisfied,
[287.12 --> 293.54]  he gathers to himself all the nations and takes captive all the peoples.
[293.54 --> 299.92]  Will not all of them taunt him with ridicule and scorn,
[300.08 --> 300.42]  saying,
[301.02 --> 306.34]  Woe to him who piles up stolen goods and makes himself wealthy by extortion.
[306.90 --> 309.00]  How long must this go on?
[310.04 --> 312.44]  Will not your debtors suddenly arise?
[312.90 --> 314.98]  Will they not wake up and make you tremble?
[315.28 --> 316.94]  Then you will become their victim.
[316.94 --> 322.42]  Because you have plundered many nations, the peoples who are left will plunder you.
[323.48 --> 328.58]  For you have shed man's blood and you have destroyed the lands and cities and everyone in them.
[330.26 --> 337.94]  Woe to him who builds his realm by unjust gain to set his nest on high to escape the clutches of ruin.
[337.94 --> 345.12]  You have plotted the ruin of many peoples, shaming your own house and forfeiting your life.
[346.04 --> 351.50]  The stones of the wall will cry out and the beams of the woodwork will echo it.
[353.24 --> 358.22]  Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed and establishes a town by crime.
[358.90 --> 363.54]  Has not the Lord Almighty determined that the people's labor is only fuel for the fire,
[363.64 --> 365.82]  that the nations exhaust themselves for nothing?
[365.82 --> 373.72]  For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.
[375.50 --> 380.64]  Woe to him who gives drink to his neighbors, pouring it from the wineskin till they are drunk,
[380.84 --> 383.26]  so that they can gaze on their naked bodies.
[383.90 --> 386.34]  You will be filled with shame instead of glory.
[386.86 --> 388.02]  Now it is your turn.
[388.38 --> 389.76]  Drink and be exposed.
[389.76 --> 395.64]  The cup from the Lord's right hand is coming around to you and disgrace will cover your glory.
[395.82 --> 403.90]  The violence you have done to Lebanon will overwhelm you and your destruction of animals will terrify you.
[404.38 --> 406.22]  For you have shed man's blood.
[406.34 --> 409.26]  You have destroyed the lands and cities and everyone in them.
[409.26 --> 415.22]  Of what value is an idol, since a man has carved it?
[415.78 --> 417.84]  Or an image that teaches lies?
[418.60 --> 421.24]  For he who makes it trusts in his own creation.
[421.60 --> 423.52]  He makes idols that cannot speak.
[424.14 --> 429.44]  Woe to him who says to wood, come to life or to lifeless stone, wake up.
[430.26 --> 431.28]  Can it give guidance?
[431.28 --> 434.38]  It's covered with silver and gold.
[434.82 --> 436.72]  There is no breath in it.
[437.76 --> 440.70]  But the Lord is in his holy temple.
[441.74 --> 445.62]  Let all the earth be silent before him.
[446.62 --> 447.92]  This is the word of the Lord.
[447.92 --> 459.64]  A little while ago I was going out for a walk with my son Malachi.
[459.90 --> 462.40]  We were playing at a park or something.
[462.48 --> 463.72]  I don't exactly remember where.
[464.20 --> 467.66]  And we came up to a place where the path split off.
[467.66 --> 471.64]  And I knew that eventually the path joined up again.
[471.98 --> 476.88]  Again on the other side of the bush or the forest or whatever that we were walking in.
[477.10 --> 480.20]  And that it was really only like 30 feet away.
[480.34 --> 484.48]  Yet you could not see the place from where we were where the paths joined together.
[485.32 --> 489.12]  And so I said to Malachi, I said, Malachi, you go left and I'll go right.
[489.30 --> 490.46]  And we'll see what happens.
[490.52 --> 491.24]  And he looked at me.
[491.28 --> 492.28]  You know, Malachi is only six.
[492.42 --> 494.48]  And so rightly with a little bit of intimidation.
[494.48 --> 496.72]  Like, are you sure, Dad?
[496.82 --> 497.94]  This is kind of scary.
[498.02 --> 499.88]  You're going to let me go off on my own?
[500.70 --> 501.50]  And I said, it's okay.
[501.82 --> 502.90]  I'll be nearby.
[503.06 --> 503.56]  I'll find you.
[503.58 --> 506.76]  And he was never really more than 10 or 20 feet away from me.
[507.40 --> 511.70]  And if I looked really closely for his bright green stripe on his coat, I would be able to see him.
[512.38 --> 513.28]  But off he went.
[514.00 --> 514.82]  And off I went.
[515.78 --> 516.50]  And he went.
[517.90 --> 522.34]  And I walked to the other side of the path where they joined up together.
[522.34 --> 523.12]  And I looked.
[523.30 --> 524.54]  And I didn't see him.
[525.84 --> 532.00]  I said, maybe I was wrong to let him do this.
[532.40 --> 533.30]  And so I called his name.
[533.40 --> 535.12]  I said, Malachi, what's going on?
[535.86 --> 538.76]  And I heard a little voice off just around the bend.
[538.90 --> 539.62]  I'm here, Dad.
[540.46 --> 541.88]  And so I walked down the path.
[541.90 --> 542.88]  And I went to check it out.
[542.88 --> 552.38]  And there he was on the side of the road looking at some birds that had collected because somebody had left a pile of bird seed on the path.
[552.80 --> 559.86]  And he had stopped and picked up the bird seed and was holding it in his hand, trying to get the birds to come like Disney princesses to eat out of his hand.
[561.00 --> 562.70]  He got distracted along the way.
[562.88 --> 564.88]  It took longer to get to where we were going.
[564.98 --> 566.36]  But we ended up in the same spot.
[566.36 --> 575.02]  And I share that story because it's kind of a parallel for what I want to do with this text.
[575.70 --> 579.58]  So we're going to take two different avenues to get to the same place.
[580.16 --> 583.54]  One of them is going to take a little bit longer to get there as we wrestle with it.
[584.16 --> 586.82]  And then we'll come back and grab the other one.
[587.62 --> 592.28]  Now to begin, like I say, I'm going to give you a little bit of a road map so that you know where we're going.
[592.28 --> 592.72]  Right?
[593.68 --> 599.66]  And that way, as we go, you'll see how these two separate paths come to the same place.
[599.68 --> 601.48]  How the two parts fit the whole.
[602.50 --> 611.00]  Now I believe that this chapter, this response of God to Habakkuk's complaint, is centered around one idea, one destination.
[611.56 --> 617.46]  A come and coming reality of who God is and what God is doing in the world.
[617.46 --> 629.26]  Now in short, I think chapter 2 helps us see that the goal of it all, the goal of everything, is the glory of God and then our experience of it.
[630.78 --> 641.14]  And then in the text, what we will see is that God uses two avenues in his speech to get us to that one end goal.
[641.14 --> 647.84]  And so that one avenue is a survey of the whole movements of all of history, right?
[647.92 --> 649.84]  From beginning to new beginning.
[651.16 --> 665.02]  And then that second avenue, the one that will take us a little bit longer, is a sort of comparison to what I'm calling an experience of lesser glories or misplaced glories.
[665.02 --> 675.02]  Now for those of you who have been around church for a while, this experience of lesser glories or misplaced glories is what the Bible commonly calls idolatry.
[676.38 --> 682.08]  And so the goal, the point, right, is the glory of God revealed and experienced.
[682.56 --> 691.72]  And the ways that we're going to get there through this text is by seeing the sweeping movements of all of history and then by way of contrast with lesser glories.
[691.72 --> 695.98]  And so let's start at the end, right?
[696.02 --> 699.90]  Let's start with the goal, the glory of God revealed and experienced.
[700.68 --> 705.88]  Now if you have your Bible in your hands, and of course you probably should, look at verse 14.
[707.20 --> 714.78]  Now you can also see what we're about to say from verse 2 and verse 20, but we're going to start with verse 14 because it's the most clear.
[714.78 --> 726.98]  And then I'm going to encourage you to come back to verse 2 and 20 in your personal devotions or your personal reflection this week so you can try to find it and trace it in the same way just for the sake of our time together this morning.
[727.74 --> 731.72]  Now verse 14 should be familiar to many of you by now, right?
[731.76 --> 735.30]  It's January's Bible memory verse from Emmanuel Kitts.
[735.74 --> 740.00]  We go over it every week with the help of actions and kids from home, right?
[740.00 --> 746.18]  For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as waters cover the sea.
[747.86 --> 750.58]  Really, that's pretty straightforward, right?
[750.62 --> 752.02]  The image is clear and helpful.
[752.66 --> 755.26]  For the earth, that's here, right?
[755.34 --> 760.20]  This place, us, everything will be filled.
[761.46 --> 762.34]  Now notice the tense.
[762.74 --> 764.06]  Will be filled, right?
[764.08 --> 766.00]  That's a future reality.
[766.00 --> 771.36]  That's something the people of Habakkuk's day could anticipate and long for.
[771.48 --> 780.90]  Something that is particularly or partially fulfilled in Jesus come the first time round and so is already come in part.
[781.06 --> 787.90]  And something that will ultimately then be fulfilled at the fullness of things or the restoration of all things.
[787.90 --> 796.24]  So there's this already not yet, this come and coming aspect to this reality, but we'll come back to that in a moment.
[796.36 --> 797.34]  So hang on to that.
[799.54 --> 805.18]  For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord.
[805.18 --> 816.90]  Now, in Hebrew, the root word translated knowledge isn't just knowing a list of information.
[818.28 --> 826.32]  In Hebrew, the root of knowledge, to know, has a depth and an intimacy to it.
[826.32 --> 837.22]  Perhaps this is a little bit PG-13, but in some places in the Bible it will say something like, Abraham knew Sarah and they had Isaac.
[838.48 --> 841.30]  Y'all know what know means in that case?
[842.50 --> 842.76]  Right?
[842.84 --> 845.92]  There's an intimacy to that kind of knowledge.
[846.72 --> 846.86]  Right?
[846.90 --> 852.22]  There's an intimacy, a relational characteristic to knowing God.
[852.22 --> 853.10]  Right?
[853.16 --> 855.78]  There's something deep and special about it.
[856.06 --> 863.24]  A knowledge of God, to know Him in the Bible is to have a relationship with Him, to have a covenant with Him.
[863.28 --> 876.12]  Now, I get that that's a kind of fancy church word or maybe legal word, but a covenant is an intentional, purposed, directed, empowered relationship that affects and consumes everything we do.
[876.12 --> 884.44]  And so, to be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord is more than just to know something.
[884.96 --> 886.78]  It is experiencing it.
[886.86 --> 887.98]  It is living it.
[888.06 --> 892.30]  It is relating to it and relating to others by it.
[894.06 --> 897.20]  Now, the glory of the Lord.
[897.42 --> 897.54]  Right?
[897.58 --> 899.92]  The knowledge of the glory of the Lord.
[899.92 --> 910.76]  Now, a real simple way to get at what the glory of the Lord is, and I think this is from John Piper who probably himself got it from Jonathan Edwards before him.
[911.18 --> 917.88]  But John Piper, I think it is, says, the glory of the Lord is the going public of God's holiness.
[919.18 --> 919.46]  Right?
[919.48 --> 924.16]  The glory of God is the public display of His holiness.
[924.58 --> 924.86]  Right?
[924.86 --> 926.72]  His perfection, His righteousness.
[927.28 --> 934.32]  Yes, but holiness also means His otherness, His distinctness, His set-apartness.
[934.64 --> 934.80]  Right?
[934.94 --> 944.88]  Holiness for God and then for us down the line from Him as His people, as Christians living in the world, holiness isn't just a moral reality.
[945.96 --> 946.20]  Right?
[946.20 --> 948.18]  It is that, but it's also so much more.
[948.60 --> 952.64]  Holiness for God and for us is an ontological reality.
[952.80 --> 953.86]  It is an existential reality.
[953.86 --> 959.64]  It is to have a relationship with God is to be set apart.
[960.38 --> 960.48]  Right?
[960.50 --> 966.00]  It is to be changed, to be transformed from death into life.
[966.34 --> 966.58]  Right?
[966.60 --> 969.98]  To be transformed from one degree of glory to another.
[970.88 --> 970.96]  Right?
[971.34 --> 980.90]  Holiness for us is to experience the glory of God in a way that changes who you are and what you do.
[980.90 --> 983.34]  And that's the point.
[983.76 --> 987.04]  That's the goal of all of this.
[987.10 --> 987.26]  Right?
[987.32 --> 991.86]  The whole earth, the whole world will be changed.
[994.36 --> 1000.52]  For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.
[1000.52 --> 1006.36]  What's the difference between seas and water?
[1008.04 --> 1008.42]  Right?
[1008.42 --> 1009.48]  It's not a trick question.
[1009.60 --> 1011.98]  It's not the salinity content or something like that.
[1012.22 --> 1012.44]  Right?
[1012.48 --> 1014.04]  What's the difference between seas and water?
[1014.74 --> 1015.84]  There's no difference.
[1016.62 --> 1016.72]  Right?
[1016.76 --> 1017.60]  They're water.
[1018.00 --> 1018.74]  That's the point.
[1018.98 --> 1020.64]  The sea is water.
[1020.64 --> 1024.06]  Wherever there is sea, there is water.
[1025.66 --> 1026.24]  Right?
[1026.26 --> 1027.42]  That's the goal of God.
[1027.84 --> 1033.86]  That one day, wherever there is anywhere, there is the glory of God.
[1034.88 --> 1035.08]  Right?
[1035.14 --> 1037.10]  God's glory will be everywhere.
[1037.28 --> 1042.22]  The experience of his going public holiness will be everywhere.
[1042.54 --> 1045.84]  The purpose of his kingdom will be everywhere.
[1045.84 --> 1052.20]  The knowledge of the Lord, a relationship to him and with him will be everywhere.
[1052.84 --> 1056.84]  That's God's goal in creation, that he would be glorified.
[1057.68 --> 1064.72]  That's what God does and why God does what he does, that he would get the glory.
[1065.18 --> 1065.32]  Right?
[1065.36 --> 1067.72]  That's why God said, let there be light.
[1067.86 --> 1073.32]  That's why God says, you are the light of the world, for the revelation of his glory.
[1073.32 --> 1076.46]  And here's the thing.
[1078.44 --> 1085.48]  I know that this might offend some of you or be a surprise to some of you, but here's
[1085.48 --> 1086.56]  the thing that comes out of this, right?
[1088.56 --> 1090.74]  It's not about you.
[1092.46 --> 1097.18]  The world, history, creation is not about you.
[1097.98 --> 1098.46]  Right?
[1098.48 --> 1100.60]  It's not centered around you.
[1100.60 --> 1103.26]  It's not for your personal pleasure.
[1103.68 --> 1108.32]  And yet in the culture that we live in, in the Western individualistic society that we
[1108.32 --> 1109.68]  find ourselves in, right?
[1109.72 --> 1111.82]  It's a culture of me and I.
[1111.98 --> 1116.14]  And this idea that it's not about me might be a tough pill to swallow.
[1116.44 --> 1117.58]  Because here it is, right?
[1117.76 --> 1122.10]  Your life isn't even about you.
[1122.10 --> 1124.66]  It's about God.
[1125.32 --> 1125.54]  Right?
[1125.54 --> 1126.80]  It's about his glory.
[1126.96 --> 1128.60]  It's about the worship of his name.
[1128.70 --> 1133.46]  It's about giving God his due as the only one worthy of praise.
[1133.88 --> 1140.92]  History is about God's going public over the whole earth that we might experience him.
[1140.92 --> 1143.26]  And that's the thing, right?
[1145.70 --> 1152.34]  The God who does everything for his glory is for you.
[1153.66 --> 1157.42]  It's not about you, but he's for you.
[1158.00 --> 1158.22]  Right?
[1158.26 --> 1160.94]  He longs for you to be found in him.
[1161.08 --> 1164.84]  He has made you to be in a relationship with him.
[1164.84 --> 1170.74]  And while it's not about you, when you make it all about him, that's when you actually
[1170.74 --> 1174.34]  find your joy and purpose and meaning and power.
[1174.56 --> 1180.84]  That's the open secret of the gospel, that when you die to self and live for Christ, that's
[1180.84 --> 1182.24]  when you actually live.
[1185.26 --> 1192.16]  Irenaeus was an early church apologist, and he has a quote that says,
[1192.16 --> 1196.42]  The glory of God is the human being fully alive.
[1197.22 --> 1199.64]  The glory of God is the human being fully alive.
[1199.76 --> 1201.80]  And so, to help us understand that, just turn it around.
[1203.24 --> 1203.44]  Right?
[1203.50 --> 1206.24]  How do you live as a human being fully alive?
[1207.10 --> 1208.68]  By living for the glory of God.
[1210.96 --> 1215.76]  Again, I think it's Piper borrowing from Jonathan Edwards, but he says,
[1215.76 --> 1220.70]  God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.
[1222.16 --> 1225.22]  And that's ultimately what is the goal.
[1225.38 --> 1229.40]  What is the point of that triangle, the place that we're going.
[1229.68 --> 1232.48]  And that's getting us into this first side.
[1232.62 --> 1232.72]  Right?
[1232.86 --> 1240.26]  Habakkuk reveals that the goal of the glory of God to be experienced in this life and
[1240.26 --> 1244.20]  throughout all the earth, he gets to that by way of a contrast.
[1244.82 --> 1247.86]  A contrast with lesser glories.
[1247.86 --> 1254.42]  Things that we have exchanged in our lives for that one good, glorious experience of who
[1254.42 --> 1259.48]  God is and what God has done and in a relationship with him for something else.
[1259.84 --> 1265.58]  Other things or other means or ideas that we put stock in or found purpose from.
[1265.58 --> 1275.44]  The second part of the chapter, the Lord speaks what are called five woe statements.
[1275.98 --> 1276.14]  Right?
[1276.22 --> 1278.76]  You saw it as we read, beginning in verse 6.
[1279.22 --> 1279.40]  Right?
[1279.52 --> 1280.58]  Woe to him.
[1282.14 --> 1289.70]  Now, what I want you to see is that each of these woe statements center around a way of
[1289.70 --> 1295.04]  being in the world that is contrary to the goal that we have seen.
[1296.36 --> 1296.58]  Right?
[1296.64 --> 1303.58]  If the goal is God's glory and all of your life is about God's glory, not yours, anything
[1303.58 --> 1305.10]  else is a cheap substitute.
[1305.28 --> 1310.20]  Anything else is an experience of lesser glory or raising up a created thing in the place
[1310.20 --> 1312.84]  of the creator or a good thing to an ultimate thing.
[1312.84 --> 1321.40]  And unfortunately, and if you're honest with yourself, you'll see this in your life, and
[1321.40 --> 1327.98]  I know it's true because I see it in mine when I'm honest with myself, we often prefer
[1327.98 --> 1333.94]  the cheap substitute because it's quicker or it's easier or it's more close at hand.
[1334.06 --> 1335.04]  It's more immediate.
[1335.94 --> 1336.50]  Right?
[1336.50 --> 1343.22]  We prefer the lesser glory because we have ultimately misplaced our meaning and our purpose
[1343.22 --> 1350.50]  and rooted our life in ourselves rather than in Him who created life.
[1351.44 --> 1358.84]  Quickly, look at me, look with me starting at verse 6 where Habakkuk has written, God has
[1358.84 --> 1365.18]  spoken, woe to him who piles up stolen goods and makes himself wealthy by extortion.
[1365.18 --> 1369.18]  Now, in a word, this is the trap of consumerism.
[1369.86 --> 1370.28]  Right?
[1370.36 --> 1376.92]  When you think that your heart and life will be satisfied by things, by more and more things,
[1377.22 --> 1383.64]  and when you've bought into that lie, we will do almost anything to satisfy it.
[1384.50 --> 1388.86]  Problem is, right, nothing ever actually satisfies it.
[1389.20 --> 1390.12]  But do we learn?
[1391.22 --> 1391.50]  Nope.
[1391.50 --> 1397.08]  We just go back to the next thing or the next new, the new best, the new new.
[1398.26 --> 1404.54]  And somehow, right, kind of insanely actually, we think that something will be different this
[1404.54 --> 1407.76]  time with this thing or with this new.
[1409.24 --> 1414.98]  But here's the really insidious part about this way of seeing and being in the world.
[1414.98 --> 1418.04]  It never actually feels insane.
[1418.94 --> 1419.34]  Right?
[1419.36 --> 1420.16]  It just feels normal.
[1420.56 --> 1422.54]  It feels that this is the way we're supposed to be.
[1422.64 --> 1424.20]  This is how the world works.
[1424.38 --> 1425.76]  It doesn't even feel wrong.
[1426.30 --> 1426.66]  Right?
[1426.68 --> 1429.52]  That this is just the way our hearts are wired.
[1430.36 --> 1431.36]  Or so we think.
[1431.94 --> 1435.34]  And so we keep coming back to it time and time again.
[1435.34 --> 1437.54]  And God is saying, whoa!
[1439.70 --> 1444.10]  Wake up to a greater reality of glory.
[1445.24 --> 1447.14]  All right, next he goes to verse 9.
[1447.50 --> 1453.32]  Woe to him who builds up his realm by unjust gain to set his nest on high to escape the clutches
[1453.32 --> 1454.04]  of ruin.
[1455.70 --> 1462.92]  Now again, we're rushing through this pretty quick, but this is a lesser glory of status
[1462.92 --> 1464.40]  and position.
[1465.50 --> 1465.72]  Right?
[1465.78 --> 1472.88]  As if meaning and value on your life and in your life can finally be found when people
[1472.88 --> 1475.98]  laud my prowess and accomplishments.
[1476.72 --> 1477.08]  Right?
[1477.12 --> 1482.74]  When we find satisfaction in the praise of others and security in our accomplishments.
[1484.86 --> 1485.92]  Verse 12.
[1486.90 --> 1491.26]  Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed and establishes a town by crime.
[1491.26 --> 1495.10]  All right, this is finding purpose in power.
[1495.52 --> 1495.62]  Right?
[1495.68 --> 1500.58]  And in small ways and big ways, this is a test for some of us.
[1501.06 --> 1501.18]  Right?
[1501.22 --> 1505.26]  How will we use the authority given us?
[1506.62 --> 1510.18]  You're probably familiar with the quote from Lord Acton.
[1510.38 --> 1510.74]  Right?
[1510.78 --> 1515.40]  Who says that power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[1516.34 --> 1516.76]  Right?
[1516.76 --> 1520.66]  There is a proper understanding of authority and power.
[1520.76 --> 1523.24]  A proper submission to authority.
[1523.82 --> 1524.14]  Right?
[1524.20 --> 1529.80]  As citizens living here in Canada, we submit ourselves to the government and to law enforcement.
[1529.80 --> 1535.64]  As church members, we submit ourselves to the spiritual authority of the elders over us.
[1535.64 --> 1539.98]  As children, you submit yourselves to the authority of your parents.
[1539.98 --> 1542.18]  Right?
[1545.54 --> 1547.50]  But governments can overreach.
[1549.08 --> 1550.44]  Pastors abuse power.
[1551.50 --> 1553.22]  And parents exasperate their kids.
[1554.54 --> 1557.78]  Authority is a tool, but we so easily make it a weapon.
[1557.78 --> 1567.56]  That's the danger of exchanging a lesser glory for the real glory of who God is.
[1569.18 --> 1570.00]  God continues.
[1570.16 --> 1573.44]  Woe to him, verse 15, who gives drink to his neighbors.
[1574.44 --> 1580.66]  Now, this one actually gets pretty graphic and is probably PG-13.
[1580.66 --> 1590.66]  And so, if you want to have a discussion and look more closely at this, we can find another time to do that when it would be more appropriate and the people are listening in a more age-appropriate way.
[1590.72 --> 1595.08]  But you can figure it out if you look closely at the words that are given there.
[1595.18 --> 1598.48]  But ultimately, this is about taking advantage of people.
[1599.42 --> 1599.60]  Right?
[1599.64 --> 1601.36]  In the text, it's about doing that sexually.
[1601.70 --> 1604.06]  But it's also, you know, more generally so.
[1604.06 --> 1605.00]  Right?
[1605.06 --> 1611.04]  This is when you think of other people more as a means than as an end.
[1611.48 --> 1611.70]  Right?
[1611.74 --> 1614.86]  Not an end in themselves distinct from your purposes.
[1616.08 --> 1621.12]  Now, maybe you've heard or used the phrase before, I've got no use for him.
[1622.76 --> 1623.66]  What does that mean?
[1624.54 --> 1627.30]  That we've reduced people to tools for our purposes.
[1628.42 --> 1631.64]  And when they lose function, we lose them.
[1631.64 --> 1634.10]  Right?
[1634.12 --> 1639.18]  And this is an example, ultimately, of how we substitute a lesser glory for the greater glory.
[1639.18 --> 1653.52]  Because what we are actually saying in that moment by doing that or by thinking that or by treating other people that way is that we think of ourselves and the sort of behavior that comes from that as more important or as ultimate.
[1653.52 --> 1653.74]  Right?
[1653.80 --> 1661.02]  The worldview behind this way of thinking and being in the world is that it's all for my good, for my pleasure.
[1661.02 --> 1663.50]  It's all about my purposes and my glory.
[1663.86 --> 1666.02]  You are here to serve me.
[1667.18 --> 1674.96]  Now, if you know the words of Jesus, he says, I did not come to be served, but to serve.
[1675.78 --> 1679.40]  You know that that's not the proper way of understanding our relationship to people.
[1679.40 --> 1680.80]  And yet we do it.
[1682.64 --> 1685.78]  Because properly understood, it's not about you.
[1685.78 --> 1698.28]  We've seen how we've exchanged lesser evils for the glory of God as the greatest, exchanged lesser glories for the greatest glory.
[1698.50 --> 1700.80]  And now, finally, the other side of the triangle.
[1701.74 --> 1707.92]  And coming back to my story with Malachi, this is the quick way around, so we're not going to spend as much time as we just did on there.
[1707.92 --> 1712.34]  But again, in your own study and devotion, I really do think you can dig into this.
[1713.96 --> 1715.96]  Look at verse 19.
[1718.36 --> 1721.16]  The final woe.
[1722.60 --> 1726.92]  Woe to him who says to wood, come to life.
[1726.98 --> 1729.56]  Or to the lifeless stone, wake up.
[1730.10 --> 1731.10]  Can it give guidance?
[1731.20 --> 1733.36]  It's covered with gold and silver.
[1733.36 --> 1740.36]  But verse 19 makes explicit what has been behind all the other woe statements, right?
[1740.42 --> 1747.24]  That all of these raising up of lesser glories is simply idolatry.
[1748.40 --> 1750.98]  And the question of verse 18 is helpful.
[1751.60 --> 1754.02]  What value is an idol since man has carved it?
[1754.40 --> 1756.28]  Or an image that teaches lies?
[1756.98 --> 1759.44]  For he who makes it trusts his own creation.
[1761.18 --> 1763.02]  He makes idols that cannot speak.
[1763.36 --> 1772.96]  Ultimately, when we exchange the lesser glories, or exchange the greater glory of who God is for these lesser glories,
[1773.16 --> 1778.32]  we are taking something of our own creation and putting it in the place of God.
[1778.42 --> 1780.86]  He wants us to see that.
[1783.08 --> 1789.06]  Instead of lesser glories, God wants you to see that his glory is the singular purpose for life.
[1789.06 --> 1794.12]  That chasing lesser glories just leads to a listless wandering.
[1795.42 --> 1799.34]  God wants you to experience the lavish wonder of his glory.
[1799.34 --> 1802.22]  And that's where all this is going.
[1802.22 --> 1803.62]  And he ensures it.
[1804.14 --> 1812.38]  The other side of the triangle is the sea, the sweeping movements of history that get us to the goal of verse 14,
[1812.52 --> 1817.94]  where the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.
[1817.94 --> 1820.68]  Look at verse 3.
[1820.68 --> 1824.80]  For the revelation awaits an appointed time.
[1825.38 --> 1828.28]  It speaks of the end and will not prove false.
[1828.64 --> 1831.12]  Though it linger, wait for it.
[1831.20 --> 1836.38]  It will certainly come and will not delay.
[1836.38 --> 1845.38]  The promise of God, the reality of God at work in the world, is that from the very beginning,
[1846.32 --> 1848.84]  before God said, let there be light,
[1850.02 --> 1854.84]  God was longing for you to know the glory of who he is.
[1855.58 --> 1858.70]  And the purpose behind God saying, let there be light,
[1858.76 --> 1861.74]  and creating the world that we see and know and live in,
[1861.90 --> 1863.54]  it was for the glory of his name.
[1863.54 --> 1867.30]  And he ensures that it will get there.
[1868.06 --> 1869.80]  He created for his glory,
[1870.02 --> 1875.70]  and he created you and me, men and women, human beings in his image,
[1875.72 --> 1878.44]  that we might reflect his glory,
[1878.58 --> 1881.66]  that we might reflect something of who he is to the world.
[1881.78 --> 1886.88]  And yet, even then, our first parents chose something other.
[1886.88 --> 1890.40]  Even then, our first parents exchanged the relationship,
[1890.40 --> 1893.54]  the covenant with God for something else.
[1893.70 --> 1895.70]  They believed a lie.
[1897.14 --> 1898.84]  They rebelled against God.
[1899.76 --> 1903.58]  And in that rebellion, not just did we become sinful,
[1903.76 --> 1907.86]  but shalom, wholeness, peace on earth was broken,
[1908.12 --> 1914.68]  and now all creation suffers as a consequence of the weight and reality of our sin.
[1914.68 --> 1921.48]  And day in and day out, we live and affirm that we would have done exactly the same in that same moment.
[1922.52 --> 1925.84]  That apart from God redeeming us,
[1926.84 --> 1930.26]  we would still be lost in sin.
[1930.26 --> 1933.36]  But God gave a promise.
[1934.46 --> 1936.22]  He spoke a promise in the garden.
[1936.38 --> 1940.42]  He focused that promise in the person of Abraham and in the people of Israel,
[1940.42 --> 1944.64]  and through them revealed exactly what he would do
[1944.64 --> 1947.26]  and what it would take to call people back to himself,
[1947.52 --> 1952.06]  exactly what it would do to gather his people for the glory of his name.
[1952.64 --> 1956.36]  And in the temple and in sacrifice and in the wilderness period
[1956.36 --> 1961.18]  and in the kingship and the priestly order and in the entire history and existence
[1961.18 --> 1964.56]  and scope of Israel's movement through the drama of redemption,
[1964.92 --> 1968.02]  coming into the land, being taken out of the land and coming back into it,
[1968.24 --> 1974.36]  we begin to see God revealing for us the one who would come as the true Israel,
[1975.16 --> 1978.14]  the one who would come as the perfect son of God,
[1978.20 --> 1980.24]  who would live the life we should have lived
[1980.24 --> 1982.94]  and who would die the death that we deserve because of sin.
[1982.94 --> 1987.70]  We see what God would do to guarantee that he would be glorified.
[1991.38 --> 1997.52]  As he takes victory over sin and defeats death,
[1998.46 --> 2000.36]  the resurrection of Jesus.
[2001.78 --> 2007.24]  And this same Jesus comes into this world and has come down
[2007.24 --> 2009.34]  and has ascended to the right hand of the Father
[2009.34 --> 2012.24]  and sits now as king over all creation
[2012.24 --> 2017.38]  to the glory of God the Father, says Philippians 2.
[2018.28 --> 2023.30]  The purpose and the big movements and sweeps of history and redemption
[2023.30 --> 2029.68]  comes to Christ and then flows from him now in and through the church.
[2030.82 --> 2031.08]  Right?
[2031.16 --> 2033.94]  Jesus, the light of the world, comes, says to you,
[2034.06 --> 2035.40]  you are the light of the world.
[2035.40 --> 2040.20]  The revelation of God's glory culminating in Jesus Christ now is through us,
[2040.20 --> 2043.76]  the church, as his gathered, called and sent out people,
[2043.94 --> 2046.76]  that we might be transformed into the image of his son,
[2046.82 --> 2050.80]  that we might be the place now where the world sees God.
[2051.18 --> 2056.70]  All of this, the scope of history moving towards that one day
[2056.70 --> 2058.40]  where Jesus himself would return,
[2058.86 --> 2061.76]  the sound of the trumpet with the archangels,
[2061.76 --> 2065.06]  with the glory train of all the saints who have gone before him,
[2065.10 --> 2067.40]  that he would come down to this earth
[2067.40 --> 2071.50]  and that here, on this good earth,
[2071.72 --> 2073.28]  restored and renewed,
[2073.76 --> 2076.48]  the kingdom would be established forever.
[2076.70 --> 2078.80]  That the new Jerusalem would come
[2078.80 --> 2080.16]  and there would be no temple
[2080.16 --> 2085.26]  because the dwelling place of God is now with man.
[2085.26 --> 2089.06]  That the glory of God is now with man.
[2089.06 --> 2090.60]  That the glory of God is now with man.
[2090.60 --> 2092.60]  That the glory of God is now with man.
[2092.60 --> 2096.86]  For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord
[2096.86 --> 2100.24]  as the waters cover the sea.
[2102.40 --> 2103.74]  That's where it's going.
[2105.02 --> 2110.76]  Don't exchange the greater glory of who God is for a lesser glory.
[2110.76 --> 2116.28]  Instead, experience here and now already what it might be like
[2116.28 --> 2120.64]  to know him, to serve him and love him in that way.
[2122.68 --> 2124.00]  Finally, and we'll land here,
[2125.76 --> 2128.96]  the end of verse 3 says,
[2129.10 --> 2132.20]  though it linger, wait for it.
[2132.20 --> 2135.34]  It can be hard to wait.
[2137.80 --> 2141.32]  And it might seem like it's taken God a long time to do something.
[2142.50 --> 2146.76]  It might seem like the drama of redemption has slowed down
[2146.76 --> 2149.10]  and that there are times and circumstances and situations
[2149.10 --> 2153.20]  that provide direct challenge to the rule of God in this world,
[2153.28 --> 2156.34]  that provide direct challenge to the goal of it all.
[2156.34 --> 2161.48]  As other glories or other challenges to his rule come in,
[2161.52 --> 2163.10]  be it the problem of evil,
[2163.62 --> 2166.30]  be it nations warring against nations,
[2166.48 --> 2169.28]  be it injustice globally or locally.
[2169.60 --> 2171.70]  Though it linger, wait for it,
[2171.80 --> 2175.00]  because his promise is sure.
[2176.00 --> 2179.26]  You can stake your life on that.
[2179.26 --> 2184.50]  But, verse 4, God says,
[2184.64 --> 2188.46]  the righteous will live by faith.
[2190.24 --> 2193.00]  It takes faith to live in this world.
[2194.60 --> 2197.82]  My prayer is that your faith
[2197.82 --> 2202.22]  will be in the one who created this world.
[2203.30 --> 2204.78]  And that as you live for him,
[2205.26 --> 2207.88]  as you are set apart for his purposes,
[2207.88 --> 2212.38]  as you see and experience the glory of God
[2212.38 --> 2215.22]  made manifest in you and through you,
[2215.84 --> 2218.44]  that your faith will not only be strengthened,
[2219.36 --> 2223.00]  but your heart's affections for Jesus will be stirred,
[2223.90 --> 2225.72]  and that you will be empowered
[2225.72 --> 2228.64]  and emboldened from now on
[2228.64 --> 2230.94]  to live for him.
[2232.08 --> 2232.42]  Amen?
[2233.42 --> 2234.00]  Amen.
[2234.34 --> 2235.04]  Let's pray together.
[2237.88 --> 2245.02]  Lord our God,
[2245.94 --> 2249.84]  turn our listless wandering
[2249.84 --> 2251.66]  into lavish wonder.
[2254.38 --> 2256.26]  Open our eyes to the ways
[2256.26 --> 2258.64]  that we have settled for lesser glories
[2258.64 --> 2261.02]  and captivate our hearts today
[2261.02 --> 2264.32]  with the majesty of your greatest glory,
[2264.32 --> 2265.68]  of who you are,
[2266.04 --> 2267.16]  what you have done,
[2267.24 --> 2268.88]  and what you are doing in this world,
[2268.96 --> 2270.32]  and where you are guiding
[2270.32 --> 2272.00]  all the movements of history.
[2273.14 --> 2276.12]  Cause us to long for that day.
[2276.98 --> 2279.40]  Come quickly, Lord Jesus, we pray.
[2281.16 --> 2282.06]  Come quickly.
[2283.28 --> 2283.60]  Amen.
[2283.60 --> 2283.70]  Amen.
[2284.76 --> 2285.56]  Amen.
[2285.56 --> 2285.62]  Amen.
[2286.28 --> 2287.56]  Amen.
[2287.56 --> 2288.06]  Amen.
[2288.06 --> 2288.56]  Amen.
[2288.56 --> 2289.56]  Amen.
[2289.56 --> 2290.56]  Amen.
[2290.56 --> 2291.56]  Amen.
[2291.56 --> 2292.56]  Amen.
[2292.56 --> 2293.56]  Amen.
[2293.56 --> 2293.62]  Amen.
[2293.62 --> 2293.64]  Amen.
[2293.64 --> 2293.66]  Amen.
[2293.66 --> 2293.68]  Amen.
[2293.68 --> 2293.72]  Amen.
[2293.72 --> 2294.30]  Amen.
