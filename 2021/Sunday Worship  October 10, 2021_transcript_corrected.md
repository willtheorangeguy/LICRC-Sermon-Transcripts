[366.16 → 368.48] You chose me.
[368.48 → 373.48] You're like no other.

[439.58 → 447.46] Then from north to south and east to west
[447.46 → 452.50] We'd hear Christ be magnified
[452.50 → 462.26] Were the hold of echoing His imminent
[462.26 → 469.24] His name would burst from sea and sky
[469.24 → 477.48] And from riddles to the mountain tops
[477.48 → 482.38] We'd hear Christ be magnified
[482.38 → 486.28] Here we go now
[486.28 → 487.56] Sing up!
[488.28 → 492.42] And so Christ be magnified
[492.42 → 496.04] Let His praise rise
[496.04 → 501.08] Christ be magnified in me
[501.08 → 505.76] And so Christ be magnified
[505.76 → 509.10] From the altar of my life
[509.10 → 514.88] Christ be magnified in me
[514.88 → 525.64] When every creature finds its inmost melody
[525.64 → 531.84] And every human heart is native

[532.58 → 537.78] Of anyone in wrath
[537.78 → 540.76] Should Him or praise
[540.76 → 545.80] Will see Christ be magnified
[545.80 → 547.80] Yes, this is what we're made to do, right?
[547.80 → 550.30] We give you praise, Jesus
[550.30 → 551.52] Come on!
[551.52 → 556.02] And so Christ be magnified
[556.02 → 559.30] Let His praise rise

[570.14 → 572.14] From the altar of my life
[572.14 → 577.14] Christ be magnified in me
[577.14 → 581.14] I want to be whole
[581.14 → 583.14] I want to be sanctified, Jesus
[583.14 → 585.14] I want to be sanctified, Jesus
[585.14 → 587.14] Burning ye, Jesus
[587.14 → 589.14] Burning ye, Jesus
[589.14 → 594.18] I won't bow to idols
[594.18 → 597.18] I'll stand strong and worship you
[597.18 → 600.68] And if it puts me in the fire
[600.68 → 604.18] I'll rejoice, because you're there too
[604.18 → 606.18] I won't be...
[606.18 → 608.18] I won't be...
[608.18 → 610.18] I won't be...

[764.98 → 766.98] Amen.
[794.98 → 796.98] Amen.
[824.98 → 830.70] As we celebrate Thanksgiving together, we're going to do that here with a worship service.
[830.88 → 837.00] And so everyone is invited to participate in our worship tomorrow at 10 a.m. here in
[837.00 → 838.28] person or online.
[838.40 → 846.36] You can join us in that way as we give thanks to God for his many blessings and also as
[846.36 → 850.04] we trust in his provision for the future.
[850.76 → 854.90] And so even if this past year has not seemed like one full of blessing,
[855.48 → 861.94] we come in faith, trusting that God will provide as we go into the remainder of this year.
[863.16 → 866.76] Also, there is an announcement for the Young Adults group.
[867.64 → 874.28] Young Adults, you have the final event of the Prochurch tournament coming up next week, Saturday.
[874.98 → 879.58] And so that's going to be a corn maze, and Josh wants you to know that it's going to be muddy.
[880.76 → 888.12] And so wear appropriate footwear and pants and the like, and be prepared to do that.
[888.16 → 891.22] As far as I know, our church is in second place right now,
[891.34 → 894.44] and I just want to encourage you to bring home that trophy.
[895.66 → 900.74] We need to start this Prochurch tournament thing off with a win.
[902.38 → 907.20] Also, for the Young Adults, and this is for everyone, but connected to the Young Adults ministry,
[907.20 → 914.22] again this year, we want to be able to send care packages out to the young adults in our midst
[914.22 → 919.54] who are away at university, or college, or in trade school,
[919.60 → 922.60] and so have left our community here and gone somewhere else.
[922.60 → 927.60] We want to bless them with a care package gift as exam season approaches.
[928.68 → 935.54] Now, it seems early for that, but we want to mail them, and so we have to take some time to do that.
[935.62 → 941.66] And so please, either as a family or an individual or a care group or something like that,
[941.76 → 948.46] consider how you can bless one of our young adults who are away at school with a feeling of family.
[948.46 → 954.62] And so we send a shoeboxes sized package to them full of about $50 worth of stuff,
[954.80 → 960.32] although if our last attempt at this $50 was a suggestion, and you all just ignored it.
[961.10 → 963.42] And so we're grateful for your blessing in that way.
[963.46 → 967.50] But if you want to participate in that, it's going to be first come, first served.
[968.06 → 970.34] And so talk to Josh Chamberlain.
[970.40 → 973.46] You can email him or text him or DM him on Instagram,
[973.46 → 977.54] and he will get you in the queue for that.
[978.94 → 981.86] Standing together, we are the church family of God,
[981.90 → 985.84] and we come to worship him as he gathers us in his presence.
[985.94 → 991.60] So I invite you to receive, then, the greeting of our good God.
[993.10 → 996.76] Grace, mercy, and peace to you.
[997.20 → 1001.12] From God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son and our Saviour,
[1001.12 → 1004.60] through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[1005.30 → 1005.94] Everyone said?
[1006.94 → 1007.46] Amen.
[1010.94 → 1013.60] In Exodus 15, we read,
[1014.56 → 1018.42] I will sing to the Lord, for he is highly exalted.
[1019.28 → 1021.48] The Lord is my strength and my defence.
[1022.12 → 1023.98] He has become my salvation.
[1025.20 → 1027.46] He is my God, and I will praise him,
[1027.68 → 1030.80] my Father's God, and I will exalt him.
[1031.92 → 1033.64] Who among gods is like you, Lord?
[1034.72 → 1035.78] Who is like you?
[1036.58 → 1041.24] Majestic in holiness, awesome in glory, working wonders?
[1042.84 → 1046.58] Let's sing together of the goodness and greatness of our God.

[1557.42 → 1563.32] We continue our worship by the giving of our gifts in gratitude with us for our
[1563.32 → 1568.06] in gratitude and thankfulness to the Lord for his blessings.
[1569.02 → 1574.32] For the church budget, which covers the administration of the church and its ministries,
[1574.90 → 1578.54] and the special offering today is for the Langley Food Bank.
[1579.40 → 1584.80] The Langley Food Bank is a very effective voice in preaching the gospel to the poor
[1584.80 → 1590.50] through the good works of its volunteers because actions speak louder than words.
[1590.50 → 1596.04] Actions will often create the pathway for the words to be heard.
[1596.90 → 1601.58] God's call to the church is to identify with the poor, the weak, the vulnerable,
[1601.94 → 1605.70] and to invest our time, energy, and money into serving them.
[1606.52 → 1614.40] The long-term objective of the Langley Food Bank is to effect lasting transformation in the lives of the clients,
[1614.70 → 1619.20] to bring them from a life of poverty to a life of productivity and hope.
[1619.20 → 1627.78] They recognize the absolute need for the intervention and work of the Holy Spirit as crucial to this process,
[1628.28 → 1635.88] as well as the vital necessity for a new and ongoing relationship with God the Father through Jesus Christ, his Son.
[1637.02 → 1644.36] The Langley Food Bank Society operates two food banks, one here in Langley and one in Alder grove.
[1644.36 → 1650.54] The offering for the Thanksgiving service tomorrow will also be for the Langley Food Bank,
[1650.94 → 1657.62] and you are encouraged to bring items to church that have been listed as most needed by the food bank
[1657.62 → 1662.28] in the lists provided in the bulletins over the last two to three weeks.
[1662.28 → 1666.44] Jesus answered the young man,
[1666.44 → 1671.54] If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor,
[1672.06 → 1673.80] and you will have treasure in heaven.
[1674.50 → 1675.90] Then come, follow me.
[1676.52 → 1678.34] Matthew 19, verse 21.
[1679.72 → 1686.16] Next week's offering is for the church budget and refugee chaplain, Dina Nikolai.

[1975.32 → 1977.32] Come on, everybody.
[1985.32 → 1987.32] How's everyone doing this morning?
[1987.32 → 1990.32] It's a little bit of a special weekend this weekend.
[1990.32 → 1991.32] Does anybody know what it's about?
[1991.32 → 1993.32] What's up?
[1993.32 → 1995.32] Thanksgiving.
[1995.32 → 1999.32] Is everybody having a family kind of dinner today or this weekend?
[1999.32 → 2000.32] Yeah?

[2002.32 → 2003.32] Right on.
[2003.32 → 2008.32] So this morning we're going to do a video, and we got someone in the church,
[2008.32 → 2011.32] I actually don't even know who, put together a nice video for Thanksgiving.
[2011.32 → 2016.32] And I want to see if you guys watch closely and see if you show up on that video.
[2016.32 → 2017.32] Can you do that?
[2017.32 → 2018.32] And then after that we'll do the blessing.

[2089.32 → 2093.32] I am also thankful for food and water.
[2095.32 → 2101.32] I'm thankful for God for going to hand wetting.
[2101.32 → 2105.32] I thank you and show my mommy.
[2105.32 → 2108.32] And what else are you thankful for?
[2108.32 → 2112.32] I'm thankful for everything in the sky.
[2112.32 → 2122.32] I'm thankful for my family and when I do karate.
[2122.32 → 2126.32] I'm thankful for my friends at school and for reading.
[2126.32 → 2132.32] I'm thankful for my family and for hockey.
[2132.32 → 2136.32] I'm thankful for both airplanes and trains.
[2136.32 → 2137.32] Mommy!
[2137.32 → 2138.32] Whoa!
[2138.32 → 2139.32] Kay!
[2139.32 → 2140.32] You hate mommy!
[2140.32 → 2141.32] Mommy!

[2147.32 → 2148.32] Grandma!
[2148.32 → 2149.32] Dad!
[2149.32 → 2163.32] I'm thankful for food and for my mom, and I am thankful for the world.
[2163.32 → 2164.32] I'm thankful for my puppy Theo.
[2164.32 → 2165.32] He's my little doggy.
[2165.32 → 2166.32] All right.
[2166.32 → 2167.32] That was fantastic.
[2167.32 → 2169.32] Now we can stand up everyone, and we're going to do the blessing right now.
[2169.32 → 2174.32] We can face, let's face that way.
[2174.32 → 2175.32] All right.
[2175.32 → 2176.32] Hands ready.
[2176.32 → 2177.32] The Lord.
[2177.32 → 2178.32] And also with you.
[2178.32 → 2179.32] All right.
[2179.32 → 2180.32] Let's go.
[2180.32 → 2181.32] Go.
[2181.32 → 2182.32] And go.
[2182.32 → 2183.32] Thank you for the cause of the story of the world.
[2183.32 → 2184.32] In the name of God.
[2184.32 → 2185.32] Thank you.
[2185.32 → 2186.32] I'm thankful for the Lord.
[2186.32 → 2187.32] I'm thankful for the love of God.
[2187.32 → 2189.32] There's a great day of the love of God.
[2189.32 → 2190.32] All right.
[2190.32 → 2191.32] That was fantastic.
[2191.32 → 2194.32] Now we can stand up everyone, and we're going to do the blessing right now.
[2194.32 → 2195.32] We can face, let's face that way.
[2195.32 → 2196.80] and also with you.
[2225.32 → 2234.06] It was such a lovable thing.
[2236.56 → 2239.68] Everybody, oh, apparently it is a thing.
[2241.88 → 2247.20] We are going to come to God in our church family prayer together,
[2248.20 → 2251.26] and I'm going to lead us in that.
[2251.26 → 2258.58] And in addition to some of the things that you've already seen in the e-bulletin,
[2258.66 → 2262.98] if you receive that, we are going to pray.
[2264.30 → 2269.36] Specifically, there are a number of families who are currently
[2269.36 → 2272.12] and directly being touched by COVID,
[2272.58 → 2277.48] and some of them have chosen to keep that anonymous,
[2277.70 → 2280.34] and of course we understand that, but we want to pray for that.
[2280.34 → 2285.84] And we know that many of us here know who these people might be
[2285.84 → 2288.56] and have that in our own families and life together.
[2288.68 → 2293.24] And so being mindful of the struggles and the difficulties of all of that,
[2293.32 → 2297.32] we want to lift those people up in our prayer together.
[2298.08 → 2303.04] In addition to our prayer, we will be giving thanks with Frank and Sylvia
[2303.04 → 2307.26] for the marriage of their daughter Cheryl to her now husband Kyle,
[2307.26 → 2309.32] which took place in the church here on Friday,
[2309.42 → 2312.94] and that's where you see these beautiful flowers are left over from that.
[2313.06 → 2315.96] And so we celebrate with them, and we give thanks to God for that.
[2316.18 → 2318.88] Would you join your heart with me in prayer together?
[2318.88 → 2327.24] Holy God and Heavenly Father,
[2327.88 → 2330.60] we come before you in prayer.
[2331.36 → 2333.56] We come to you,
[2334.96 → 2337.80] acknowledging that you alone are sovereign God,
[2337.94 → 2340.98] that you alone rule o'er all the earth,
[2341.12 → 2345.34] that by your word we live and move and have our being.
[2345.34 → 2350.26] And so we come now asking you to speak that word,
[2350.40 → 2352.92] asking you to be at work in the world,
[2353.10 → 2356.32] asking you to meet us here
[2356.32 → 2364.34] so that, Lord God, we can know your presence.
[2365.08 → 2367.24] We can know your nearness.
[2367.24 → 2373.56] God, we come into your presence as a people in great need.
[2374.30 → 2376.34] We look around the world, and we see
[2376.34 → 2381.90] the seeming reign and rule of chaos and disorder.
[2383.98 → 2388.84] See the challenges that exist to your sovereignty.
[2388.84 → 2395.32] And so God, we pray for places like Afghanistan
[2395.32 → 2399.62] and the struggle that is taking place there,
[2399.74 → 2400.92] the Taliban in power,
[2401.10 → 2402.88] and then also now conflicting with ISIS
[2402.88 → 2405.68] and improvised explosive devices
[2405.68 → 2408.86] going off in mosques and in markets.
[2409.72 → 2414.10] We pray for the turmoil of the people who are living there,
[2414.20 → 2416.68] asking that you would bring peace.
[2416.68 → 2420.60] We pray, Lord God, for the measures
[2420.60 → 2423.74] that we as global citizens have taken
[2423.74 → 2428.14] to provide that with UN workers
[2428.14 → 2430.96] and the presence on the ground.
[2431.14 → 2435.56] We pray that you would provide a measure of stability.
[2437.66 → 2439.66] And yet, God, we know that there will be an impact,
[2439.80 → 2442.78] especially on women that live in Afghanistan.
[2442.78 → 2446.70] And so we pray for them and for their safety
[2446.70 → 2450.04] and their ability to thrive in society.
[2451.52 → 2457.78] We pray, too, for the currently verbal
[2458.48 → 2462.98] but also accelerating tensions of China and Taiwan.
[2463.84 → 2467.66] Pray, Lord God, that cooler heads
[2467.66 → 2470.00] and wisdom would prevail there
[2470.00 → 2473.56] even as we hear the threats of violence.
[2475.10 → 2478.92] Pray, Lord, that you would move in power
[2478.92 → 2481.64] through different agents and agencies
[2481.64 → 2486.06] to help restore peace and calm
[2486.06 → 2487.70] and wisdom to that region.
[2487.70 → 2493.84] Lord our God, as we come closer to home,
[2493.98 → 2496.02] we know that we have our own struggles here,
[2496.06 → 2497.54] not just with COVID
[2497.54 → 2502.28] and the effects of that on the economy
[2502.28 → 2503.04] and the lives.
[2503.16 → 2504.48] And we hear stories of
[2504.48 → 2509.04] even as the government releases job reports
[2509.04 → 2511.72] that seem good, and we've added more jobs
[2511.72 → 2513.56] and we've returned to pre-pandemic levels
[2513.56 → 2514.06] of employment.
[2514.58 → 2516.74] We know that here on the ground
[2516.74 → 2517.84] there is still impact,
[2518.02 → 2520.54] that business people are talking about
[2520.54 → 2521.90] how their businesses are affected,
[2522.00 → 2524.30] their employees are not able to come in
[2524.30 → 2526.96] or places have to shut down.
[2527.78 → 2530.10] And so in the midst of all of this, Lord God,
[2530.18 → 2533.42] we come to you asking for healing,
[2533.68 → 2535.36] asking for peace,
[2535.36 → 2538.36] asking that you would move in power.
[2538.36 → 2544.10] Likewise, God, as we have received an offering here
[2544.10 → 2545.38] for the Langley Food Bank,
[2545.48 → 2546.76] we pray for their work.
[2546.98 → 2548.84] We pray for our community
[2548.84 → 2551.46] and those who rely on the food bank
[2551.46 → 2553.00] and other social services
[2553.00 → 2556.20] to provide just the bare necessities of life.
[2557.34 → 2559.06] Pray that you would use us
[2559.06 → 2561.88] in our relative wealth
[2561.88 → 2563.56] and in our actual wealth
[2563.56 → 2566.30] to provide and to come alongside
[2566.30 → 2567.36] in those places.
[2567.36 → 2570.70] And not just with gifts of our treasures
[2570.70 → 2572.90] and our excess or abundance,
[2573.06 → 2573.64] but Lord God,
[2573.76 → 2577.78] with sacrificial presence and giving.
[2579.48 → 2582.98] Allow us to reveal your kingdom come
[2582.98 → 2585.66] and your kingdom coming here in Langley
[2585.66 → 2587.92] and through that work in the world.
[2590.30 → 2592.14] Father, we pray then for the mission
[2592.14 → 2593.70] and ministry of our church
[2593.70 → 2594.80] here at Langley Emmanuel.
[2594.80 → 2597.60] We thank you for the running
[2597.60 → 2599.50] and the starting of programs,
[2599.62 → 2601.68] some of which haven't been running
[2601.68 → 2602.88] for a couple of years
[2602.88 → 2606.70] because of our pandemic response
[2606.70 → 2608.10] and the realities around that.
[2608.16 → 2609.24] We thank you that those things
[2609.24 → 2611.58] are coming back and starting up.
[2611.68 → 2615.58] And so we pray for the GEMS and Cadets programs.
[2615.72 → 2617.78] We pray for the Children's Worship Times programs
[2617.78 → 2619.12] and the Coffee Break ministries.
[2619.12 → 2620.62] We pray, Lord God,
[2620.70 → 2622.84] for different care groups
[2622.84 → 2625.16] and the Seniors Alive group
[2625.16 → 2627.60] and the Men's Meeting group.
[2627.80 → 2630.50] We pray for all of these ministries and places,
[2630.70 → 2631.92] all of these opportunities,
[2632.20 → 2634.44] and there's so many, many more
[2634.44 → 2635.94] that you have us doing,
[2636.38 → 2637.70] asking that you would bless them,
[2638.66 → 2639.04] keep them.
[2639.04 → 2642.36] Father God, we give you thanks
[2642.36 → 2643.16] for those times
[2643.16 → 2644.72] that we can see you at work
[2644.72 → 2646.00] in the world so clearly.
[2647.32 → 2649.54] And we pray that you would use those times
[2649.54 → 2652.10] to give us hope and faith
[2652.10 → 2653.74] for when we cannot see,
[2655.02 → 2656.78] that we might endure faithfully
[2656.78 → 2660.42] even as we go forward blindly,
[2661.42 → 2664.30] even as we now see through a glass darkly.
[2664.30 → 2666.40] We pray that our response
[2666.40 → 2669.84] would be intentional and devoted to you.
[2671.60 → 2673.58] God, we give you thanks as well
[2673.58 → 2675.12] with Frank and Sylvia
[2675.12 → 2678.60] and the celebration of Cheryl and Kyle's wedding.
[2679.32 → 2682.72] We pray that you would bless Cheryl and Kyle
[2682.72 → 2683.56] in their marriage,
[2683.66 → 2685.98] that you would bless Frank and Sylvia
[2685.98 → 2686.90] and their family
[2686.90 → 2689.08] and in the celebrations that can happen.
[2689.18 → 2689.80] And Lord God,
[2689.86 → 2691.78] that you would bless us all
[2691.78 → 2693.88] in relationships
[2693.88 → 2696.56] and the establishing of relationships
[2696.56 → 2699.02] in our families and life together.
[2701.62 → 2703.02] God, we know as well
[2703.02 → 2705.44] that there are many struggles
[2705.44 → 2707.24] in our community.
[2708.88 → 2712.18] Today, we mourn with Joanne and Willie.
[2713.62 → 2715.72] They are remembering
[2715.72 → 2718.04] and struggling through the death
[2718.04 → 2720.12] of their nephew, Ryan.
[2720.12 → 2722.38] We know that he had
[2722.38 → 2724.28] a long struggle with cancer,
[2724.92 → 2726.68] that he was just 33 years old,
[2726.74 → 2727.92] that he leaves behind a wife
[2727.92 → 2728.88] and three young children.
[2729.98 → 2731.90] We pray that you would be near to them
[2731.90 → 2732.70] in their grief.
[2734.12 → 2735.60] We thank you for their faith.
[2736.50 → 2737.66] We thank you for the testimony
[2737.66 → 2740.64] that we heard from Sonia.
[2741.42 → 2742.76] But we pray, Lord God,
[2742.82 → 2743.76] that you would continue
[2743.76 → 2745.04] to draw near to them,
[2746.24 → 2748.64] continue to gather them up
[2748.64 → 2750.26] in your loving heart
[2750.26 → 2751.18] in this time.
[2753.54 → 2755.22] God, we continue in prayer
[2755.22 → 2756.36] for the Spa family
[2756.36 → 2758.34] as they too mourn
[2758.34 → 2760.02] the loss of Deb.
[2761.14 → 2762.08] We pray, Lord God,
[2762.20 → 2764.28] for Peter and for the kids
[2764.28 → 2765.56] and for their
[2765.56 → 2767.72] now adjusting
[2767.72 → 2769.58] to a new way
[2769.58 → 2770.76] of life
[2770.76 → 2772.00] and living together
[2772.00 → 2772.92] without a wife,
[2773.04 → 2774.06] without a mom.
[2774.06 → 2776.78] God, some of us
[2776.78 → 2777.54] can't imagine
[2777.54 → 2779.00] the trials
[2779.00 → 2779.94] and the difficulty
[2779.94 → 2780.64] and the hardship
[2780.64 → 2781.18] of that.
[2782.14 → 2782.86] Some of us
[2782.86 → 2783.94] know it all too well.
[2785.60 → 2786.80] So we come together,
[2786.92 → 2787.20] Lord God,
[2787.24 → 2788.28] as a church family
[2788.28 → 2790.20] asking that you would
[2790.20 → 2791.70] draw us near,
[2791.82 → 2792.94] asking that you would
[2792.94 → 2795.14] bless those
[2795.14 → 2796.24] who mourn,
[2797.24 → 2798.56] that you would allow us
[2798.56 → 2799.82] to mourn
[2799.82 → 2801.14] with them together,
[2801.14 → 2802.50] to enter into that
[2802.50 → 2805.00] valley of the shadow
[2805.00 → 2805.64] of death
[2805.64 → 2806.66] together.
[2809.80 → 2810.82] God, we want to pray
[2810.82 → 2811.88] for those whom we know
[2811.88 → 2812.56] who are
[2812.56 → 2814.38] indeed struggling
[2814.38 → 2815.56] with COVID,
[2815.72 → 2816.30] especially those
[2816.30 → 2817.34] who are in hospital.
[2817.50 → 2818.18] We pray for
[2818.18 → 2819.16] Martin,
[2819.48 → 2820.16] Karen's dad,
[2820.24 → 2820.84] as he remains
[2820.84 → 2821.56] in the ICU
[2821.56 → 2822.56] on life support.
[2824.32 → 2825.16] God, it gets
[2825.16 → 2828.34] hard when we don't
[2828.34 → 2828.82] have answers
[2828.82 → 2829.48] and when we don't
[2829.48 → 2831.74] see treatment
[2831.74 → 2832.16] working.
[2832.72 → 2833.40] And so we pray
[2833.40 → 2834.50] for your healing
[2834.50 → 2835.56] in this circumstance.
[2835.82 → 2836.36] We pray for
[2836.36 → 2837.66] peace.
[2837.92 → 2838.70] We pray for
[2838.70 → 2839.60] your strength.
[2839.76 → 2840.12] We pray,
[2840.34 → 2840.74] Lord God,
[2840.82 → 2842.06] that you would
[2842.06 → 2843.32] provide what only
[2843.32 → 2844.38] you can provide.
[2845.86 → 2847.52] Even when we rely
[2847.52 → 2848.96] on medical technologies,
[2849.14 → 2849.98] even when we
[2849.98 → 2851.30] have hope
[2851.30 → 2852.28] in procedures,
[2852.50 → 2853.40] we know that it is
[2853.40 → 2854.38] you who work
[2854.38 → 2855.48] in and through them.
[2855.56 → 2856.60] And so work here
[2856.60 → 2857.58] for Martin.
[2858.82 → 2860.38] God, we know
[2860.38 → 2861.18] that you can work
[2861.18 → 2861.96] and so we give you
[2861.96 → 2864.36] thanks in the life
[2864.36 → 2865.20] of Patrick
[2865.20 → 2865.96] that we have seen
[2865.96 → 2866.46] that work
[2866.46 → 2867.72] and his struggle
[2867.72 → 2869.30] with COVID
[2869.30 → 2870.96] and his hospitalization
[2870.96 → 2872.62] and his many weeks
[2872.62 → 2874.58] on the ventilator.
[2875.14 → 2875.74] We thank you
[2875.74 → 2876.32] and celebrate
[2876.32 → 2877.02] with Sarah
[2877.02 → 2877.88] and their family
[2877.88 → 2878.92] the news
[2878.92 → 2880.34] that he is now
[2880.34 → 2880.86] stable
[2880.86 → 2882.56] and in good care
[2882.56 → 2884.08] and good spirits.
[2884.22 → 2884.62] We pray,
[2884.88 → 2885.28] Lord God,
[2885.36 → 2887.18] for continued stories
[2887.18 → 2887.92] like that.
[2889.04 → 2889.58] Thank you
[2889.58 → 2890.14] that his wife,
[2890.28 → 2890.50] Kate,
[2890.62 → 2891.32] was able to meet
[2891.32 → 2891.68] with him
[2891.68 → 2892.94] and to hold hands
[2892.94 → 2893.30] with him
[2893.30 → 2893.78] and to speak
[2893.78 → 2894.18] with him.
[2895.30 → 2895.88] And with Sarah,
[2895.98 → 2896.22] God,
[2896.26 → 2897.30] we pray that you
[2897.30 → 2898.44] would continue
[2898.44 → 2900.34] to be near them.
[2903.34 → 2903.74] God,
[2903.76 → 2904.54] we know as well
[2904.54 → 2907.36] that there are
[2907.36 → 2909.36] members of our
[2909.36 → 2909.98] church family
[2909.98 → 2911.82] and really young
[2911.82 → 2912.68] members of our
[2912.68 → 2913.32] church family
[2913.32 → 2915.00] who have COVID
[2915.00 → 2916.14] or have COVID
[2916.14 → 2916.94] in their classrooms
[2916.94 → 2917.72] and are affected
[2917.72 → 2918.80] by this now
[2918.80 → 2919.76] having to be
[2919.76 → 2920.98] at home again
[2920.98 → 2921.80] for a period
[2921.80 → 2922.36] of time
[2922.36 → 2923.32] through digital
[2923.32 → 2923.68] learning.
[2924.42 → 2925.24] We pray,
[2925.42 → 2925.78] Lord God,
[2925.82 → 2926.46] that you would
[2926.46 → 2928.02] bring healing
[2928.02 → 2929.10] to each
[2929.10 → 2930.24] and every person
[2930.24 → 2930.88] here affected.
[2932.24 → 2933.00] We pray,
[2933.12 → 2933.48] Lord God,
[2933.54 → 2934.26] for the families
[2934.26 → 2935.10] that surround
[2935.10 → 2936.14] those who are
[2936.14 → 2937.34] sick and unwell
[2937.34 → 2938.34] give them
[2938.34 → 2939.10] what they need.
[2939.70 → 2940.66] We pray for the
[2940.66 → 2941.12] many ways
[2941.12 → 2941.52] that that will
[2941.52 → 2942.28] affect the rest
[2942.28 → 2942.92] of life
[2942.92 → 2943.74] and work
[2943.74 → 2944.96] and being
[2944.96 → 2945.44] together,
[2945.56 → 2946.18] especially this
[2946.18 → 2947.04] Thanksgiving weekend
[2947.04 → 2948.32] when we had
[2948.32 → 2949.22] so many hopes
[2949.22 → 2949.92] and dreams
[2949.92 → 2950.76] and plans
[2950.76 → 2952.12] to be gathered
[2952.12 → 2953.32] as families.
[2955.58 → 2956.10] God,
[2956.14 → 2956.52] in the midst
[2956.52 → 2957.02] of this,
[2957.28 → 2958.12] we know
[2958.12 → 2958.94] the unique
[2958.94 → 2960.00] impact it's
[2960.00 → 2960.76] having on those
[2960.76 → 2961.40] who work in
[2961.40 → 2961.80] healthcare.
[2962.74 → 2963.46] We want to pray
[2963.46 → 2965.04] for all of those
[2965.04 → 2965.80] whom we know
[2965.80 → 2966.36] here in our
[2966.36 → 2966.88] church family
[2966.88 → 2967.56] and beyond
[2967.56 → 2968.82] who are working
[2968.82 → 2969.32] in healthcare
[2969.32 → 2970.18] either as nurses
[2970.18 → 2971.06] or care aides
[2971.06 → 2972.32] or staff
[2972.32 → 2973.24] in long-term
[2973.24 → 2973.86] care homes
[2973.86 → 2974.66] or in hospitals.
[2975.38 → 2976.04] We pray,
[2976.20 → 2976.36] God,
[2976.48 → 2977.76] that you would
[2977.76 → 2978.72] uphold them
[2978.72 → 2979.40] in there,
[2980.24 → 2981.06] that you would
[2981.06 → 2982.52] speak words
[2982.52 → 2983.08] of encouragement
[2983.08 → 2983.62] and hope
[2983.62 → 2984.98] what they do,
[2985.56 → 2986.16] that they would
[2986.16 → 2987.46] know your nearness
[2987.46 → 2988.14] and that your
[2988.14 → 2988.86] nearness would be
[2988.86 → 2989.72] mediated to them
[2989.72 → 2991.12] through us,
[2991.36 → 2992.24] through our prayers,
[2992.46 → 2992.96] through our
[2992.96 → 2993.98] encouragements,
[2994.14 → 2995.30] through our support
[2995.30 → 2996.24] together.
[2996.24 → 2999.82] Father God,
[2999.88 → 3000.52] now we come
[3000.52 → 3001.58] to you
[3001.58 → 3002.96] that you would
[3002.96 → 3003.92] speak your
[3003.92 → 3005.46] truth to us
[3005.46 → 3007.34] and so take
[3007.34 → 3007.96] your word
[3007.96 → 3008.86] and plant it
[3008.86 → 3010.04] deep in our
[3010.04 → 3010.54] hearts
[3010.54 → 3011.74] and allow it
[3011.74 → 3012.38] to grow
[3012.38 → 3013.54] into newness
[3013.54 → 3014.30] of life.
[3015.40 → 3016.72] Speak in power
[3016.72 → 3017.78] so that we might
[3017.78 → 3018.70] go from this
[3018.70 → 3019.78] place refreshed
[3019.78 → 3020.86] and renewed
[3020.86 → 3021.88] and encouraged
[3021.88 → 3023.72] in our journeys
[3023.72 → 3024.46] of faith
[3024.46 → 3026.02] and faithfulness.
[3027.10 → 3028.30] Help us
[3028.30 → 3030.14] to understand
[3030.14 → 3031.72] and to grow
[3031.72 → 3032.88] in the grace
[3032.88 → 3033.86] and knowledge
[3033.86 → 3034.68] of our Lord
[3034.68 → 3035.26] and Saviour,
[3035.42 → 3036.14] Jesus Christ,
[3036.28 → 3037.24] in whose name
[3037.24 → 3037.98] we pray.
[3039.06 → 3039.46] Amen.
[3039.46 → 3039.54] Amen.
[3040.82 → 3041.38] Amen.
[3041.38 → 3052.06] As we just
[3052.06 → 3052.46] prayed,
[3052.60 → 3053.98] we are going
[3053.98 → 3054.36] to spend
[3054.36 → 3055.12] some time
[3055.12 → 3056.86] in God's
[3056.86 → 3057.14] word,
[3057.54 → 3058.16] opening that
[3058.16 → 3058.44] up.
[3059.38 → 3060.34] We are
[3060.34 → 3061.58] continuing
[3061.58 → 3062.44] this week
[3062.44 → 3063.18] in a series
[3063.18 → 3064.22] that Pastor Kevin
[3064.22 → 3065.08] started us
[3065.08 → 3066.60] in last week,
[3067.40 → 3067.86] a series
[3067.86 → 3068.30] called
[3068.30 → 3068.98] Exiles
[3068.98 → 3069.82] in a Pagan
[3069.82 → 3070.28] Land
[3070.28 → 3070.68] and it's
[3070.68 → 3072.60] through 1 Peter
[3072.60 → 3074.24] in our
[3074.24 → 3075.32] reading together
[3075.32 → 3077.12] and last week
[3077.12 → 3077.68] we looked at
[3077.68 → 3078.20] what it means
[3078.20 → 3079.14] to be born again
[3079.14 → 3080.16] into a living hope.
[3080.72 → 3080.84] Now,
[3081.24 → 3082.32] before I jump
[3082.32 → 3083.22] into it too far,
[3083.30 → 3083.74] I just want to put
[3083.74 → 3084.58] this in front of you
[3084.58 → 3085.76] again one more time.
[3085.86 → 3087.80] This is a Bible study
[3087.80 → 3089.16] that I,
[3089.38 → 3090.16] along with a few
[3090.16 → 3091.16] friends of mine,
[3091.66 → 3093.36] wrote after a few
[3093.36 → 3094.76] years of studying
[3094.76 → 3096.72] the early church
[3096.72 → 3098.02] and their response
[3098.02 → 3099.12] to paganism
[3099.12 → 3099.84] and then studying
[3099.84 → 3100.84] in 1 Peter,
[3101.72 → 3104.56] for many,
[3104.72 → 3105.40] many years,
[3105.88 → 3107.28] a few centuries
[3107.28 → 3107.78] actually,
[3108.02 → 3108.62] if you were
[3108.62 → 3109.12] to read
[3109.12 → 3109.86] a commentary,
[3110.78 → 3111.58] which is just
[3111.58 → 3112.58] a study book
[3112.58 → 3113.40] on particular
[3113.40 → 3114.24] books of the Bible,
[3114.34 → 3114.68] if you were
[3114.68 → 3115.58] to read a commentary
[3115.58 → 3116.74] on 1 Peter,
[3117.10 → 3118.00] it would often
[3118.00 → 3119.48] say something like,
[3120.04 → 3122.08] 1 Peter is addressed
[3122.08 → 3122.74] to a group
[3122.74 → 3123.24] of Christians
[3123.24 → 3124.12] who don't live
[3124.12 → 3124.88] in a situation
[3124.88 → 3126.18] like ours.
[3126.18 → 3127.42] We live in a Christian
[3127.42 → 3127.90] culture,
[3127.90 → 3129.06] and so we have
[3129.06 → 3129.72] to be creative
[3129.72 → 3130.62] in our application.
[3131.46 → 3133.12] In the last 20 or 30 years,
[3133.88 → 3134.94] commentary writing
[3134.94 → 3135.82] has changed
[3135.82 → 3136.92] on 1 Peter
[3136.92 → 3139.00] because more and more
[3139.00 → 3139.92] we are recognizing
[3139.92 → 3141.24] that we are living
[3141.24 → 3142.62] in a post-Christian
[3142.62 → 3143.48] culture,
[3143.62 → 3144.12] or we are living
[3144.12 → 3145.46] in a resurgence
[3145.46 → 3147.74] of even paganism.
[3148.92 → 3149.06] Right?
[3149.12 → 3149.70] The reality,
[3150.44 → 3152.22] the atheist
[3152.22 → 3153.44] secular project
[3153.44 → 3154.56] of the 90s
[3154.56 → 3155.70] and early 2000s
[3155.70 → 3156.64] seems to have failed
[3156.64 → 3157.54] because now people
[3157.54 → 3158.62] say things like,
[3159.50 → 3160.32] I'm spiritual
[3160.32 → 3161.86] but not religious.
[3162.86 → 3163.66] If you've ever
[3163.66 → 3164.24] heard that,
[3164.92 → 3166.76] that's a fundamentally
[3166.76 → 3168.60] pagan idea.
[3169.30 → 3169.48] Now,
[3169.50 → 3169.92] we'll get into
[3169.92 → 3170.80] some of that stuff
[3170.80 → 3171.64] in this series
[3171.64 → 3172.60] and look at that,
[3172.60 → 3174.16] but there is
[3174.16 → 3174.78] a Bible study
[3174.78 → 3175.18] that we have
[3175.18 → 3176.74] given out to you
[3176.74 → 3177.72] and offered to you
[3177.72 → 3179.12] to go through,
[3179.22 → 3179.96] not necessarily
[3179.96 → 3182.38] in line with our series,
[3182.48 → 3183.02] you go through it
[3183.02 → 3183.72] at your own pace,
[3183.76 → 3184.12] whether it's
[3184.12 → 3184.86] with your care group
[3184.86 → 3186.34] or whatever else
[3186.34 → 3186.82] you have.
[3187.14 → 3188.20] I know the coffee break
[3188.20 → 3189.60] ladies are doing it,
[3189.64 → 3190.32] there's some other
[3190.32 → 3190.88] care groups
[3190.88 → 3191.76] that are doing it,
[3191.88 → 3192.56] there are individuals
[3192.56 → 3193.44] who are going through.
[3193.90 → 3194.08] Anyway,
[3194.12 → 3195.18] if you would like this,
[3196.02 → 3197.66] we can make a copy
[3197.66 → 3198.64] available for you
[3198.64 → 3199.20] and have it,
[3199.62 → 3200.36] and then also
[3200.36 → 3201.02] we're working on
[3201.02 → 3202.28] getting digital copies
[3202.28 → 3203.56] available for those
[3203.56 → 3204.12] people who would
[3204.12 → 3204.82] prefer to function
[3204.82 → 3205.78] with it that way.
[3206.14 → 3206.48] And so,
[3206.88 → 3207.90] you can find that,
[3207.96 → 3208.72] you can talk to me
[3208.72 → 3209.46] or you can email
[3209.46 → 3210.54] Marilyn in the office
[3210.54 → 3211.98] and she will get
[3211.98 → 3214.04] this set for you.
[3215.44 → 3215.84] Now,
[3215.90 → 3216.32] last week,
[3216.40 → 3216.78] as we said,
[3216.88 → 3217.98] Kevin started us off
[3217.98 → 3218.94] by grounding us
[3218.94 → 3220.68] in the living hope
[3220.68 → 3221.44] of Jesus
[3221.44 → 3223.10] and he had a beautiful
[3223.10 → 3224.04] line in his sermon
[3224.04 → 3224.76] and I wrote it down
[3224.76 → 3225.28] in my Bible.
[3225.40 → 3225.64] He said,
[3225.78 → 3227.80] Jesus is our inheritance.
[3229.76 → 3230.50] And I'm going to be
[3230.50 → 3231.68] honest with you,
[3231.68 → 3232.60] if you take anything
[3232.60 → 3233.76] out of this series
[3233.76 → 3234.82] and out of 1 Peter,
[3235.14 → 3236.26] let it be that line
[3236.26 → 3237.04] and then let that
[3237.04 → 3237.86] permeate through
[3237.86 → 3238.50] the rest of your
[3238.50 → 3239.06] understanding.
[3239.56 → 3241.28] Jesus is our
[3241.28 → 3242.28] inheritance.
[3243.58 → 3244.04] So,
[3244.10 → 3244.84] as we are coming
[3244.84 → 3246.02] into this study
[3246.02 → 3247.38] under that banner,
[3247.52 → 3248.62] asking
[3248.62 → 3249.66] of how do we live
[3249.66 → 3250.36] as exiles
[3250.36 → 3251.26] in a pagan land,
[3251.52 → 3252.52] it's important for us
[3252.52 → 3253.36] to just maybe
[3253.36 → 3254.98] quickly recap
[3254.98 → 3255.98] what do we mean
[3255.98 → 3257.00] when we use the word
[3257.00 → 3257.68] pagan
[3257.68 → 3258.84] and what do we mean
[3258.84 → 3259.70] when we use the word
[3259.70 → 3260.44] exiles?
[3261.46 → 3261.68] Now,
[3261.80 → 3262.08] first,
[3262.92 → 3263.28] pagan,
[3263.44 → 3263.80] actually,
[3264.14 → 3265.42] it used to be
[3265.42 → 3266.76] when it was first used
[3266.76 → 3269.34] in the Roman times
[3269.34 → 3270.52] in Latin,
[3271.32 → 3272.32] used to just mean
[3272.32 → 3273.32] country dweller.
[3274.64 → 3274.92] And so,
[3275.06 → 3275.72] in some sense,
[3275.78 → 3276.64] it's kind of like
[3276.64 → 3277.52] the word redneck.
[3278.56 → 3279.00] Are you familiar
[3279.00 → 3279.58] with that word?
[3280.14 → 3280.80] Maybe hick
[3280.80 → 3282.28] or country bumpkin,
[3283.16 → 3283.38] right?
[3284.02 → 3284.96] Those who were
[3284.96 → 3286.28] removed from
[3286.28 → 3286.74] the sort of
[3286.74 → 3288.16] urban and progressive
[3288.16 → 3289.16] culture,
[3289.40 → 3290.04] and the reason
[3290.04 → 3290.80] they were called
[3290.80 → 3292.58] pagans or country dwellers
[3292.58 → 3293.00] and the reason
[3293.00 → 3294.32] it was a derogatory term
[3294.32 → 3295.50] is because they were
[3295.50 → 3296.62] hanging on to
[3296.62 → 3297.80] the sort of
[3297.80 → 3299.78] religions of old
[3299.78 → 3301.64] and the spirituality
[3301.64 → 3303.14] of old
[3303.14 → 3304.88] as the urban elite
[3304.88 → 3306.12] sort of moved on
[3306.12 → 3309.36] into the next phase
[3309.36 → 3311.34] of their life
[3311.34 → 3312.50] and religious understanding
[3312.50 → 3312.88] together.
[3313.58 → 3315.22] The country dwellers,
[3315.84 → 3316.82] the backwards people,
[3316.82 → 3318.14] were hanging on
[3318.14 → 3318.98] to these old
[3318.98 → 3320.04] ideas.
[3321.00 → 3321.56] But,
[3321.74 → 3322.36] when we take,
[3323.06 → 3323.60] when Christians
[3323.60 → 3325.04] start using that term,
[3325.42 → 3325.86] what pagan
[3325.86 → 3327.10] really means
[3327.10 → 3328.32] is anything
[3328.32 → 3329.84] not Christian.
[3330.98 → 3331.38] Anything
[3331.38 → 3332.28] that doesn't
[3332.28 → 3332.92] recognize
[3332.92 → 3334.78] the transcendent
[3334.78 → 3335.92] sovereign God
[3335.92 → 3336.62] over all
[3336.62 → 3337.50] creation,
[3338.02 → 3339.40] and then in so doing,
[3339.66 → 3340.28] when you don't
[3340.28 → 3341.00] recognize the
[3341.00 → 3341.72] sovereign God,
[3341.82 → 3342.58] you end up making
[3342.58 → 3344.08] other lesser gods
[3344.08 → 3345.72] or lesser glories,
[3345.86 → 3346.60] the Bible sometimes
[3346.60 → 3347.18] calls them.
[3347.90 → 3348.12] And so,
[3348.20 → 3348.72] here we are
[3348.72 → 3349.86] in this place
[3349.86 → 3350.90] recognizing that
[3350.90 → 3353.14] paganism for Peter
[3353.14 → 3354.60] and the early Christians
[3354.60 → 3356.20] looked a particular way
[3356.20 → 3358.88] and had a pantheon
[3358.88 → 3359.52] of gods
[3359.52 → 3360.44] available to them
[3360.44 → 3361.06] to accomplish
[3361.06 → 3362.30] a particular set
[3362.30 → 3364.02] of tasks.
[3365.04 → 3365.50] And again,
[3365.58 → 3366.02] last week,
[3366.42 → 3367.64] Kevin introduced us
[3367.64 → 3368.28] to the idea
[3368.28 → 3369.08] of paganism
[3369.08 → 3370.08] being the idea
[3370.08 → 3371.08] that the spiritual,
[3371.82 → 3372.66] whatever that means,
[3372.66 → 3375.30] is part of this world,
[3375.86 → 3376.56] and by that we mean
[3376.56 → 3377.26] it's made up
[3377.26 → 3378.60] of the same stuff
[3378.60 → 3379.86] as everything else,
[3380.34 → 3381.58] and that it is somehow
[3381.58 → 3383.32] able to affect your life
[3383.32 → 3383.88] for good
[3383.88 → 3385.52] or for your detriment.
[3386.64 → 3386.82] Now,
[3386.84 → 3387.30] if that's what
[3387.30 → 3388.28] paganism is,
[3388.72 → 3389.44] that continues
[3389.44 → 3390.46] today.
[3391.10 → 3392.00] We find ourselves
[3392.00 → 3394.32] in a cultural context
[3394.32 → 3395.16] where people
[3395.16 → 3396.42] are spiritual
[3396.42 → 3397.78] but not religious.
[3398.34 → 3399.92] I have someone
[3399.92 → 3400.52] who I know
[3400.52 → 3401.44] pretty well.
[3401.44 → 3402.80] she identifies
[3402.80 → 3404.64] as a pagan witch,
[3405.14 → 3406.70] and she says it
[3406.70 → 3407.56] as a celebration.
[3408.76 → 3410.38] If you are part
[3410.38 → 3412.72] of the millennial generation
[3412.72 → 3413.46] but even younger,
[3413.58 → 3414.44] the Gen Z generation,
[3415.40 → 3416.62] so younger than me,
[3417.46 → 3418.50] much younger than me,
[3419.82 → 3422.44] this is your normal.
[3423.88 → 3425.02] It's all over TikTok,
[3425.76 → 3426.38] for instance.
[3427.40 → 3427.58] Now,
[3427.62 → 3428.18] I know some of you
[3428.18 → 3428.44] are like,
[3428.48 → 3429.04] I have no idea
[3429.04 → 3430.14] what those last five words
[3430.14 → 3430.68] just were,
[3431.08 → 3432.14] but it's there.
[3432.66 → 3433.38] It's everywhere.
[3434.96 → 3436.48] The question becomes,
[3436.68 → 3437.80] for us as Christians,
[3437.94 → 3438.58] is how do we live
[3438.58 → 3439.28] in the midst of that?
[3440.08 → 3441.02] And that's when we begin
[3441.02 → 3441.72] to use the language
[3441.72 → 3443.22] of identifying as exiles.
[3444.80 → 3445.42] And an exile
[3445.42 → 3446.68] is someone who lives
[3446.68 → 3449.12] in a foreign culture,
[3449.24 → 3449.76] in a world
[3449.76 → 3451.10] that is not the one
[3451.10 → 3452.60] that they are from
[3452.60 → 3454.00] or, in our case,
[3454.30 → 3454.94] made for.
[3454.94 → 3457.30] In this series,
[3457.50 → 3458.78] we are asking,
[3458.90 → 3459.62] how do we live
[3459.62 → 3460.54] as exiles
[3460.54 → 3461.88] in a pagan world?
[3462.58 → 3463.62] Or to make it
[3463.62 → 3464.78] into a statement,
[3465.16 → 3465.84] we're going to see
[3465.84 → 3467.08] how being born again
[3467.08 → 3468.36] into a living hope
[3468.36 → 3470.18] changes the world.
[3471.16 → 3471.88] This week,
[3471.94 → 3472.54] in our text
[3472.54 → 3474.42] from 1 Peter,
[3475.00 → 3476.44] we're going to read
[3476.44 → 3478.98] 1 Peter 1.
[3479.04 → 3479.82] I'm going to start
[3479.82 → 3481.00] at verse 13
[3481.00 → 3481.62] and read through
[3481.62 → 3482.46] the end of the chapter
[3482.46 → 3483.36] to verse 25.
[3483.94 → 3484.60] This week,
[3484.68 → 3485.64] to put it pithily,
[3486.14 → 3487.08] we will see
[3487.08 → 3488.64] how living out
[3488.64 → 3489.74] of the living hope,
[3490.36 → 3492.74] how we live our
[3492.74 → 3493.46] of a living hope
[3493.46 → 3494.08] that comes
[3494.08 → 3495.58] by the living word.
[3496.82 → 3498.34] So that's our banner.
[3498.72 → 3500.02] Living out of the living hope
[3500.02 → 3500.56] that comes
[3500.56 → 3502.38] by the living word.
[3502.50 → 3503.30] And so if you have a Bible,
[3504.20 → 3504.88] I have that open
[3504.88 → 3505.42] in front of you.
[3505.94 → 3506.90] Keep it open as we go.
[3507.12 → 3507.80] As I read it,
[3507.82 → 3508.20] it should be
[3508.20 → 3509.08] on the screen behind me.
[3509.08 → 3513.02] 1 Peter 1,
[3513.14 → 3514.16] starting in verse 13.
[3516.56 → 3516.92] Therefore,
[3517.66 → 3518.48] with minds
[3518.48 → 3519.40] that are alert
[3519.40 → 3520.58] and fully sober,
[3521.18 → 3522.38] set your hope
[3522.38 → 3523.58] on the grace
[3523.58 → 3524.68] to be brought to you
[3524.68 → 3526.16] when Jesus Christ
[3526.16 → 3526.90] is revealed
[3526.90 → 3527.70] at his coming.
[3528.70 → 3530.16] As obedient children,
[3530.28 → 3531.00] do not conform
[3531.00 → 3532.04] to the evil desires
[3532.04 → 3532.52] you had
[3532.52 → 3533.02] when you lived
[3533.02 → 3533.48] in ignorance,
[3533.92 → 3535.18] but just as he
[3535.18 → 3535.94] who called you
[3535.94 → 3536.54] is holy,
[3536.90 → 3537.80] so be holy
[3537.80 → 3538.66] in all you do.
[3539.20 → 3539.98] For it is written,
[3540.18 → 3540.68] be holy
[3540.68 → 3542.50] because I am holy.
[3544.10 → 3545.32] Since you call
[3545.32 → 3546.00] on a father
[3546.00 → 3546.58] who judges
[3546.58 → 3547.98] each person's work
[3547.98 → 3548.98] impartially,
[3549.82 → 3551.00] live out your time
[3551.00 → 3552.56] as foreigners here
[3552.56 → 3553.86] in reverent fear.
[3554.94 → 3555.66] For you know
[3555.66 → 3556.46] that it was not
[3556.46 → 3557.52] with perishable things
[3557.52 → 3558.60] such as silver or gold
[3558.60 → 3559.48] that you were redeemed
[3559.48 → 3560.28] from the empty way
[3560.28 → 3561.24] of life handed down
[3561.24 → 3562.56] to you from your ancestors,
[3563.04 → 3565.06] but with the precious
[3565.06 → 3566.52] blood of Christ,
[3566.52 → 3568.28] a lamb without blemish
[3568.28 → 3569.34] or defect.
[3570.84 → 3572.14] He was chosen
[3572.14 → 3573.68] for the creation
[3573.68 → 3574.28] of the world,
[3574.80 → 3575.58] but was revealed
[3575.58 → 3576.66] in these last times
[3576.66 → 3577.42] for your sake.
[3578.12 → 3578.56] Through him
[3578.56 → 3579.68] you believe in God
[3579.68 → 3580.42] who raised him
[3580.42 → 3581.02] from the dead
[3581.02 → 3582.00] and glorified him
[3582.00 → 3583.00] so that your faith
[3583.00 → 3583.96] and hope
[3583.96 → 3585.06] are in God.
[3586.34 → 3587.28] Now that you have
[3587.28 → 3588.26] purified yourselves
[3588.26 → 3589.32] by obeying the truth
[3589.32 → 3590.00] so that you have
[3590.00 → 3590.68] sincere love
[3590.68 → 3591.24] for each other,
[3591.74 → 3592.66] love one another
[3592.66 → 3594.38] deeply from the heart.
[3594.38 → 3595.72] for you
[3595.72 → 3597.06] have been born again
[3597.06 → 3599.70] not of perishable seed
[3599.70 → 3601.70] but of imperishable
[3601.70 → 3603.28] through the living
[3603.28 → 3604.36] and enduring
[3604.36 → 3606.12] word of God.
[3607.12 → 3608.02] For all people
[3608.02 → 3609.08] are like grass
[3609.08 → 3610.52] and all their glory
[3610.52 → 3611.42] is like the flowers
[3611.42 → 3612.10] of the field.
[3612.50 → 3613.46] The grass withers
[3613.46 → 3614.68] and the flowers fall,
[3614.82 → 3615.40] but the word
[3615.40 → 3616.08] of the Lord
[3616.08 → 3617.72] endures forever.
[3618.72 → 3619.44] And this
[3619.44 → 3620.36] is the word
[3620.36 → 3621.38] that was preached
[3621.38 → 3622.26] to you.
[3622.26 → 3624.60] This is the word
[3624.60 → 3624.98] of the Lord.
[3627.78 → 3628.70] So first,
[3629.74 → 3630.52] living out
[3630.52 → 3631.70] of the living hope.
[3633.08 → 3634.52] As we read this text,
[3634.72 → 3636.06] verse 13
[3636.06 → 3637.60] and verse 21
[3637.60 → 3640.50] bookend
[3640.50 → 3641.88] a discussion
[3641.88 → 3643.10] about what it means
[3643.10 → 3645.00] to live as exiles
[3645.00 → 3646.06] in our hope.
[3646.94 → 3647.76] So verse 13
[3647.76 → 3648.82] said,
[3648.98 → 3650.46] set your hope
[3650.46 → 3652.82] on the grace
[3652.82 → 3653.46] to be brought
[3653.46 → 3653.90] to you
[3653.90 → 3655.20] when Jesus Christ
[3655.20 → 3656.66] is revealed
[3656.66 → 3657.52] at His coming.
[3657.98 → 3659.06] And then verse 21
[3659.06 → 3659.84] in the middle
[3659.84 → 3660.54] of what we read,
[3660.90 → 3661.34] through Him
[3661.34 → 3662.08] you believe
[3662.08 → 3663.34] and so your faith
[3663.34 → 3664.40] and hope
[3664.40 → 3665.76] are in God.
[3666.90 → 3667.44] Now the point
[3667.44 → 3668.52] that Peter is making
[3668.52 → 3669.10] is that
[3669.10 → 3670.50] what you hope
[3670.50 → 3671.06] in
[3671.06 → 3671.96] determines
[3671.96 → 3673.42] how you live
[3673.42 → 3674.18] now
[3674.18 → 3675.92] and
[3675.92 → 3678.20] how you live
[3678.20 → 3679.04] now
[3679.04 → 3680.36] reveals
[3680.36 → 3681.54] what you
[3681.54 → 3682.24] truly
[3682.24 → 3683.06] hope
[3683.06 → 3683.70] in.
[3686.18 → 3688.10] What you hope
[3688.10 → 3688.62] in determines
[3688.62 → 3689.14] how you live
[3689.14 → 3689.44] now
[3689.44 → 3690.44] and how you
[3690.44 → 3691.00] live now
[3691.00 → 3691.50] reveals
[3691.50 → 3692.10] what your
[3692.10 → 3692.46] heart
[3692.46 → 3693.02] truly
[3693.02 → 3694.16] hopes in.
[3694.90 → 3695.22] And look,
[3695.90 → 3696.38] the reality
[3696.38 → 3698.02] is that hope
[3698.02 → 3698.90] when things
[3698.90 → 3699.76] get hard,
[3700.20 → 3700.78] that looking
[3700.78 → 3701.58] for places
[3701.58 → 3702.16] and people
[3702.16 → 3702.68] and things
[3702.68 → 3703.40] or technology
[3703.40 → 3704.26] or whatever
[3704.26 → 3704.78] it is
[3704.78 → 3705.38] to put
[3705.38 → 3705.98] our hope
[3705.98 → 3706.34] in
[3706.34 → 3707.18] is just
[3707.18 → 3707.90] human.
[3709.14 → 3709.80] If you've
[3709.80 → 3710.66] grown up
[3710.66 → 3711.78] in poverty
[3711.78 → 3712.64] or on the
[3712.64 → 3714.02] brink of poverty,
[3714.74 → 3715.62] putting your hope
[3715.62 → 3716.66] in education
[3716.66 → 3717.94] as a way out
[3717.94 → 3718.80] to break
[3718.80 → 3720.20] that system,
[3720.46 → 3720.80] to break
[3720.80 → 3721.54] that history
[3721.54 → 3722.88] is what we do.
[3724.20 → 3724.90] If you are
[3724.90 → 3726.26] from a war-torn
[3726.26 → 3726.94] country,
[3727.32 → 3728.18] emigrating
[3728.18 → 3729.06] or fleeing
[3729.06 → 3729.82] as a refugee
[3729.82 → 3731.26] to another country
[3731.26 → 3732.18] is placing
[3732.18 → 3732.92] your hope
[3732.92 → 3733.74] in the idea
[3733.74 → 3734.36] that it will
[3734.36 → 3734.90] be better
[3734.90 → 3735.62] there.
[3737.84 → 3738.98] A lonely
[3738.98 → 3740.66] single mother
[3740.66 → 3741.88] wanting to be
[3741.88 → 3742.66] loved and
[3742.66 → 3743.56] cared for
[3743.56 → 3744.40] might put
[3744.40 → 3744.94] her hope
[3744.94 → 3745.82] in finding
[3745.82 → 3746.82] a husband
[3746.82 → 3747.76] to love
[3747.76 → 3748.50] her and
[3748.50 → 3749.04] her child.
[3750.14 → 3750.46] Likewise,
[3750.70 → 3751.18] a man
[3751.18 → 3751.72] needing to
[3751.72 → 3752.58] experience love
[3752.58 → 3753.20] and respect
[3753.20 → 3754.06] might put
[3754.06 → 3754.64] his hope
[3754.64 → 3755.28] in finding
[3755.28 → 3755.86] a wife.
[3756.86 → 3757.64] Someone who
[3757.64 → 3758.24] feels like
[3758.24 → 3758.56] they have
[3758.56 → 3760.18] sacrificed a lot
[3760.18 → 3761.30] or everything
[3761.30 → 3762.36] for their career,
[3762.52 → 3762.64] right?
[3762.72 → 3763.94] Sacrificed family
[3763.94 → 3764.82] or sacrificed
[3764.82 → 3765.48] vacations
[3765.48 → 3766.34] or relationships
[3766.34 → 3767.32] might put
[3767.32 → 3767.94] their hope
[3767.94 → 3769.82] in that promotion
[3769.82 → 3771.18] finally coming.
[3772.78 → 3774.06] A young person
[3774.06 → 3775.48] who doesn't feel
[3775.48 → 3776.24] like they belong
[3776.24 → 3777.02] at their school
[3777.02 → 3778.14] or who doesn't feel
[3778.14 → 3778.82] like they belong
[3778.82 → 3780.32] in their small town
[3780.32 → 3781.66] might put their hope
[3781.66 → 3782.92] in finally moving
[3782.92 → 3784.04] away to that
[3784.04 → 3784.82] university
[3784.82 → 3785.42] or college
[3785.42 → 3786.14] or to the big
[3786.14 → 3787.44] diverse city.
[3787.44 → 3789.32] Point is,
[3789.48 → 3790.78] when life is hard,
[3791.00 → 3791.54] when we face
[3791.54 → 3792.56] challenges and
[3792.56 → 3793.22] struggles,
[3793.48 → 3794.76] it's normal for us
[3794.76 → 3795.84] to look for something
[3795.84 → 3797.06] or someone
[3797.06 → 3798.68] to rescue us.
[3798.76 → 3799.26] It's normal
[3799.26 → 3800.78] for us to hope
[3800.78 → 3801.60] for something
[3801.60 → 3802.66] that will change
[3802.66 → 3803.86] our circumstances.
[3805.40 → 3806.08] Maybe that hope
[3806.08 → 3806.82] is a person.
[3807.34 → 3807.88] Maybe that hope
[3807.88 → 3809.22] is in a technology
[3809.22 → 3810.16] or a thing
[3810.16 → 3811.10] or an idea.
[3811.86 → 3813.12] Maybe you believe
[3813.12 → 3813.98] that you have
[3813.98 → 3814.80] to be your own
[3814.80 → 3815.34] rescuer.
[3815.48 → 3815.92] You have to be
[3815.92 → 3816.68] your own hope.
[3817.44 → 3819.82] That people hope
[3819.82 → 3821.56] in these crisis
[3821.56 → 3822.92] and crucible moments
[3822.92 → 3824.10] isn't what we are
[3824.10 → 3824.98] looking at
[3824.98 → 3826.02] because we all do it.
[3827.20 → 3827.78] And really,
[3827.94 → 3828.62] none of these things
[3828.62 → 3829.46] are bad
[3829.46 → 3830.26] in and of themselves.
[3830.46 → 3832.52] Education is good
[3832.52 → 3833.66] and it can change
[3833.66 → 3834.20] your life.
[3835.54 → 3836.68] Moving countries
[3836.68 → 3837.96] can be good
[3837.96 → 3838.98] and quite literally,
[3839.18 → 3840.06] in the case of refugees,
[3840.36 → 3841.70] can save your life.
[3843.36 → 3844.60] If you are familiar
[3844.60 → 3845.28] with the Bible,
[3845.42 → 3846.30] you know that the Bible
[3846.30 → 3847.38] says it is not good
[3847.38 → 3848.42] for man to be alone.
[3848.56 → 3849.42] And so we believe
[3849.42 → 3850.04] that things like
[3850.04 → 3852.08] marriage is good.
[3852.40 → 3853.48] It's not the only good,
[3853.62 → 3854.70] but it is a good.
[3855.96 → 3856.08] Right?
[3856.18 → 3857.42] Finding a community
[3857.42 → 3858.48] that fits
[3858.48 → 3860.42] and fits you
[3860.42 → 3861.68] is good.
[3862.26 → 3862.96] Putting hope
[3862.96 → 3864.60] in medical technology
[3864.60 → 3865.74] to help get you pregnant
[3865.74 → 3867.36] or to save your life
[3867.36 → 3868.54] or to keep you safe
[3868.54 → 3869.28] in a pandemic
[3869.28 → 3871.20] are good things.
[3871.20 → 3872.42] And let me say it,
[3872.58 → 3873.70] these are good things
[3873.70 → 3874.76] and they are worthwhile
[3874.76 → 3876.68] goals to have.
[3878.04 → 3879.74] But when a good goal
[3879.74 → 3882.20] becomes the greatest goal,
[3883.32 → 3884.86] when our greatest hope
[3884.86 → 3886.08] is the thing
[3886.08 → 3888.02] that will deliver
[3888.02 → 3889.58] that greatest goal,
[3890.00 → 3890.90] that person
[3890.90 → 3891.74] or that thing
[3891.74 → 3892.62] or that circumstance
[3892.62 → 3893.78] or that technology
[3893.78 → 3895.46] becomes for you
[3895.46 → 3897.42] a functional God.
[3897.42 → 3897.46] God,
[3898.34 → 3900.30] when a good
[3900.30 → 3901.84] becomes an ultimate,
[3902.26 → 3903.24] you start living
[3903.24 → 3905.02] like that will save you.
[3906.34 → 3907.84] What you hope in
[3907.84 → 3909.34] determines how you live.
[3910.12 → 3912.08] And how you live now
[3912.08 → 3913.76] reveals what we truly,
[3914.30 → 3914.76] ultimately,
[3915.56 → 3916.04] hope in.
[3917.42 → 3918.24] And when you take
[3918.24 → 3919.32] a created good
[3919.32 → 3920.44] and live your life
[3920.44 → 3921.28] towards it
[3921.28 → 3922.36] as if that thing
[3922.36 → 3922.98] will save you,
[3923.02 → 3923.66] as if that thing
[3923.66 → 3924.48] will give you purpose
[3924.48 → 3925.48] or give you meaning
[3925.48 → 3926.86] or be the answer
[3926.86 → 3927.42] to the struggle,
[3927.70 → 3928.92] you have exchanged
[3928.92 → 3929.94] the creator
[3929.94 → 3931.38] for a piece
[3931.38 → 3933.06] of his creation.
[3934.94 → 3935.64] And according to
[3935.64 → 3936.76] Romans 1.25,
[3937.12 → 3938.68] that's the most basic
[3938.68 → 3939.84] fundamental definition
[3939.84 → 3941.36] of idolatry.
[3942.82 → 3943.62] Paul writes there,
[3943.74 → 3944.48] they exchanged
[3944.48 → 3945.60] the truth about God
[3945.60 → 3946.34] for a lie
[3946.34 → 3947.36] and worshipped
[3947.36 → 3947.96] and served
[3947.96 → 3949.22] created things
[3949.22 → 3950.76] rather than
[3950.76 → 3951.34] the creator.
[3952.86 → 3954.08] And it's interesting
[3954.08 → 3955.42] to me anyway
[3955.42 → 3957.42] that this is also
[3957.42 → 3958.80] the sort of fundamental,
[3959.04 → 3960.38] the basic definition,
[3960.72 → 3962.64] the operative assumption,
[3962.92 → 3963.30] as it were,
[3963.48 → 3964.66] of paganism.
[3965.52 → 3965.74] Right?
[3965.84 → 3967.60] Seeing the created thing
[3967.60 → 3969.32] as a divine thing
[3969.32 → 3970.36] or containing
[3970.36 → 3973.26] a spark of the divine
[3973.26 → 3974.78] or a divine element.
[3975.64 → 3975.76] Right?
[3975.86 → 3977.68] Locating the fount
[3977.68 → 3978.84] of the spiritual
[3978.84 → 3980.58] in the created world,
[3980.98 → 3981.46] pushing out
[3981.46 → 3982.14] or pushing away
[3982.14 → 3983.10] or simply refusing,
[3983.10 → 3983.72] really,
[3983.82 → 3985.26] any transcendent
[3985.26 → 3986.88] to this reality
[3986.88 → 3988.16] is the way
[3988.16 → 3989.12] of paganism
[3989.12 → 3990.22] in the world,
[3990.32 → 3991.32] in the world of Peter
[3991.32 → 3993.20] and in the world of us.
[3994.44 → 3995.70] And let's be really,
[3996.20 → 3997.72] really clear.
[3999.04 → 3999.18] Right?
[3999.18 → 4000.34] This isn't just sort of
[4000.34 → 4001.42] 21st century
[4001.42 → 4003.54] Western individuals
[4003.54 → 4004.66] and cultures.
[4004.66 → 4005.88] This isn't just a
[4006.26 → 4006.30] quote,
[4006.50 → 4007.62] post-Christian
[4007.62 → 4008.88] renewed creation
[4008.88 → 4010.10] or the new
[4010.10 → 4011.22] secularism.
[4011.22 → 4011.64] Right?
[4011.72 → 4013.86] This is Christians.
[4015.24 → 4016.76] This is the temptation
[4016.76 → 4018.10] for you and me.
[4019.28 → 4019.44] Right?
[4019.44 → 4019.96] I've already said it,
[4019.98 → 4020.92] but especially for those
[4020.92 → 4021.86] of us who are millennial
[4021.86 → 4022.84] and Gen Z
[4022.84 → 4023.74] and younger.
[4025.00 → 4025.50] Right?
[4025.56 → 4026.42] This is the air
[4026.42 → 4027.18] that we breathe.
[4027.84 → 4029.02] This is the water
[4029.02 → 4029.92] we swim in.
[4030.12 → 4031.32] And you will have
[4031.32 → 4031.86] a harder
[4031.86 → 4033.18] and harder time
[4033.18 → 4034.60] sorting this out
[4034.60 → 4035.66] because it's just
[4035.66 → 4036.48] everywhere.
[4036.48 → 4039.28] This is the root
[4039.28 → 4040.14] of our therapeutic
[4040.14 → 4040.74] culture
[4040.74 → 4041.72] as an expression
[4041.72 → 4043.88] of expressive individualism.
[4044.10 → 4045.12] This is the root
[4045.12 → 4046.32] behind experience
[4046.32 → 4047.98] over rational consistency.
[4048.18 → 4048.74] This is the root
[4048.74 → 4049.82] behind feeling
[4049.82 → 4051.44] instead of thinking.
[4051.82 → 4051.92] Right?
[4051.96 → 4053.18] This is the practice
[4053.18 → 4054.50] of mindfulness,
[4054.78 → 4056.00] which is a Buddhist idea,
[4056.30 → 4057.56] being put on the list
[4057.56 → 4058.80] of spiritual disciplines
[4058.80 → 4060.42] for a Christian institution.
[4060.76 → 4061.52] This is the idea
[4061.52 → 4062.22] that karma
[4062.22 → 4062.94] is the way
[4062.94 → 4063.58] of the world
[4063.58 → 4064.88] and that we operate
[4064.88 → 4065.46] now thinking
[4065.46 → 4066.28] that some form
[4066.28 → 4067.44] of reincarnation
[4067.44 → 4068.42] is expected.
[4069.54 → 4070.08] And if you think
[4070.08 → 4070.64] that that's not
[4070.64 → 4071.30] what Christians
[4071.30 → 4071.78] are saying,
[4071.96 → 4072.78] I heard this
[4072.78 → 4073.90] from a Christian pastor
[4073.90 → 4074.48] on TikTok
[4074.48 → 4075.44] this past week.
[4077.96 → 4078.96] It's the idea
[4078.96 → 4080.24] that essential oils
[4080.24 → 4081.28] and crystals
[4081.28 → 4083.28] are the same thing.
[4085.04 → 4085.50] Spoiler,
[4085.64 → 4086.16] think what you want
[4086.16 → 4086.96] about essential oils,
[4087.14 → 4087.50] but they're not
[4087.50 → 4087.96] the same thing
[4087.96 → 4088.42] as crystals
[4088.42 → 4089.16] and what crystals
[4089.16 → 4090.16] are supposed to do.
[4092.12 → 4092.24] Right?
[4092.28 → 4093.20] Especially if you
[4093.20 → 4094.08] are under 40,
[4094.48 → 4096.36] this is our world.
[4097.76 → 4098.94] Do you have eyes
[4098.94 → 4099.60] to see it?
[4100.72 → 4101.92] Do you have an awareness
[4101.92 → 4103.08] of how insidious
[4103.08 → 4104.06] it can be?
[4105.10 → 4105.98] Do you know what to do
[4105.98 → 4107.04] and how to respond
[4107.04 → 4107.88] to your friends
[4107.88 → 4108.74] who believe
[4108.74 → 4109.84] that the earth
[4109.84 → 4110.66] is divine
[4110.66 → 4111.64] and that your
[4111.64 → 4113.16] astrological sign
[4113.16 → 4114.26] is all they need
[4114.26 → 4114.96] to know about you
[4114.96 → 4115.58] to know you?
[4117.66 → 4118.10] Right?
[4118.14 → 4118.66] It's not even
[4118.66 → 4119.94] the enneagram anymore.
[4120.56 → 4121.12] It's whether you're
[4121.12 → 4121.50] a Libra
[4121.50 → 4122.22] or a Taurus
[4122.22 → 4123.40] or an Arms
[4123.40 → 4124.14] in my case,
[4124.66 → 4125.56] which I think
[4125.56 → 4126.42] means I get angry.
[4130.98 → 4131.94] And so look,
[4133.66 → 4138.00] what is the opposite
[4138.00 → 4138.56] of hope?
[4141.24 → 4142.24] Is the opposite
[4142.24 → 4142.76] of hope
[4142.76 → 4143.96] hopelessness?
[4143.96 → 4146.14] Because I don't
[4146.14 → 4146.56] think it is.
[4146.62 → 4146.92] I don't think
[4146.92 → 4148.04] a definition
[4148.04 → 4148.88] by privation
[4148.88 → 4150.18] helps here.
[4151.12 → 4151.92] I want to suggest
[4151.92 → 4152.20] to you that
[4152.20 → 4152.78] the opposite
[4152.78 → 4153.80] of hope
[4153.80 → 4155.46] is fear.
[4157.96 → 4158.52] Specifically,
[4159.38 → 4160.80] fear of the unknown.
[4162.46 → 4163.36] Now, the future
[4163.36 → 4164.40] is unknown
[4164.40 → 4165.28] and so
[4165.28 → 4166.20] it's feared.
[4167.32 → 4167.48] Right?
[4167.48 → 4168.14] And to mitigate
[4168.14 → 4169.00] that fear,
[4169.38 → 4170.08] people try
[4170.08 → 4171.28] and find ways
[4171.28 → 4172.72] to either predict
[4172.72 → 4174.70] or to ensure
[4174.70 → 4176.18] a particular future,
[4176.30 → 4176.92] to determine
[4176.92 → 4178.36] a particular future.
[4178.50 → 4179.10] People try
[4179.10 → 4180.02] to find ways
[4180.02 → 4180.94] to lessen
[4180.94 → 4182.04] the impact
[4182.04 → 4182.82] of the unknown
[4182.82 → 4183.82] by increasing
[4183.82 → 4184.78] security
[4184.78 → 4186.00] in the present.
[4186.32 → 4186.46] Right?
[4186.50 → 4187.04] The idea being
[4187.04 → 4188.30] that I need
[4188.30 → 4189.26] enough now
[4189.26 → 4190.08] to ensure
[4190.08 → 4191.06] I will have enough
[4191.06 → 4191.74] then.
[4192.86 → 4193.18] Now,
[4193.26 → 4194.10] in the day of Peter,
[4194.10 → 4195.66] the future
[4195.66 → 4196.82] was ensured
[4196.82 → 4198.44] by the resources
[4198.44 → 4199.34] of pleasing
[4199.34 → 4200.12] the gods.
[4201.56 → 4202.10] That's still
[4202.10 → 4202.76] true today.
[4203.54 → 4204.00] We just don't
[4204.00 → 4204.76] call them gods.
[4205.50 → 4206.32] But functionally,
[4206.90 → 4207.46] they are.
[4209.00 → 4209.12] Right?
[4209.22 → 4209.82] Paganism,
[4210.36 → 4210.86] Christianity,
[4211.22 → 4211.94] all religious
[4211.94 → 4212.78] and irreligious
[4212.78 → 4213.50] worldviews
[4213.50 → 4214.58] in some way
[4214.58 → 4215.60] are operating
[4215.60 → 4216.30] in order to
[4216.30 → 4216.64] minimize
[4216.64 → 4217.76] or remove
[4217.76 → 4218.90] our fear.
[4219.66 → 4219.90] Or,
[4220.02 → 4220.60] to put it
[4220.60 → 4221.16] properly,
[4221.90 → 4222.54] to minimize
[4222.54 → 4223.74] misplaced
[4223.74 → 4224.36] fear.
[4224.74 → 4225.32] Because there's
[4225.32 → 4225.80] a sense
[4225.80 → 4226.28] in which
[4226.28 → 4226.82] when you
[4226.82 → 4227.40] understand
[4227.40 → 4227.84] the God
[4227.84 → 4228.48] of the Bible,
[4228.66 → 4228.84] right,
[4229.04 → 4229.88] that apart
[4229.88 → 4230.64] from His mercy
[4230.64 → 4231.18] and grace,
[4231.52 → 4232.18] fear is an
[4232.18 → 4233.24] appropriate response.
[4234.34 → 4234.42] Right?
[4234.64 → 4235.36] And a proper
[4235.36 → 4236.18] understanding
[4236.18 → 4237.10] of fear
[4237.10 → 4238.38] is the right
[4238.38 → 4239.72] order here.
[4240.20 → 4240.54] That's what
[4240.54 → 4241.20] Peter's getting at.
[4241.24 → 4241.90] Your Bibles are open.
[4242.00 → 4243.34] Look at verse 17.
[4243.58 → 4243.90] He says,
[4244.72 → 4245.38] Since you call
[4245.38 → 4245.96] on a Father
[4245.96 → 4246.54] who judges
[4246.54 → 4247.52] each person's work
[4247.52 → 4248.32] impartially,
[4248.76 → 4249.92] live out your time
[4249.92 → 4250.60] as foreigners.
[4250.78 → 4251.32] That's the word
[4251.32 → 4251.98] from where we get
[4251.98 → 4252.52] exiles,
[4252.70 → 4253.02] the same
[4253.02 → 4254.42] Greek word there.
[4254.80 → 4255.76] Live out your time
[4255.76 → 4256.82] as exiles
[4256.82 → 4258.68] here in reverent
[4258.68 → 4259.86] fear.
[4261.84 → 4262.72] I love the way
[4262.72 → 4264.16] that Elliot Clark
[4264.16 → 4264.92] puts it.
[4264.96 → 4265.62] He has a little book
[4265.62 → 4267.20] called Evangelism
[4267.20 → 4267.94] as Exiles.
[4268.08 → 4268.78] It's a great read.
[4268.86 → 4269.88] I highly recommend it.
[4270.42 → 4270.86] He says,
[4271.40 → 4272.58] Fearing others
[4272.58 → 4274.72] more than God
[4274.72 → 4276.14] usually demonstrates
[4276.14 → 4277.54] itself in trying
[4277.54 → 4278.78] to please them
[4278.78 → 4280.62] more than God.
[4280.62 → 4280.66] God.
[4282.48 → 4282.88] Now,
[4282.92 → 4283.44] I get it.
[4284.08 → 4284.68] Those of you
[4284.68 → 4285.80] who know the Bible,
[4286.74 → 4287.14] you're going to
[4287.14 → 4288.08] quote the Bible
[4288.08 → 4288.62] back to me.
[4289.48 → 4289.96] You're going to say,
[4290.04 → 4290.20] Well,
[4290.40 → 4290.66] Pastor,
[4290.76 → 4291.26] doesn't the Bible
[4291.26 → 4292.02] say perfect love
[4292.02 → 4292.82] drives out fear?
[4293.52 → 4293.76] Yes,
[4293.80 → 4294.10] it does.
[4294.18 → 4294.76] 1 John 4,
[4294.80 → 4295.08] 18.
[4295.50 → 4296.06] I know the Bible,
[4296.18 → 4296.28] too.
[4297.72 → 4298.18] And of course,
[4298.24 → 4298.72] that's right.
[4299.42 → 4300.14] But I'm talking
[4300.14 → 4300.74] about the kind
[4300.74 → 4301.58] of fear here
[4301.58 → 4303.54] that is reverence.
[4304.26 → 4304.44] Right?
[4304.52 → 4304.74] Like,
[4305.08 → 4306.26] the fear of the Lord
[4306.26 → 4307.00] is the beginning
[4307.00 → 4308.08] of wisdom.
[4309.04 → 4309.78] That kind of fear.
[4310.44 → 4310.64] Right?
[4310.68 → 4311.54] It's not the fear
[4311.54 → 4312.28] that dominates
[4312.28 → 4313.62] our world today,
[4313.68 → 4314.72] which is something else.
[4314.76 → 4315.86] This is another kind.
[4316.46 → 4318.26] The opposite of hope
[4318.26 → 4319.94] kind of fear
[4319.94 → 4320.68] is different
[4320.68 → 4322.02] than a reverent fear
[4322.02 → 4323.00] of the Lord.
[4323.62 → 4324.50] But let me also be clear
[4324.50 → 4325.66] because I'm not trying
[4325.66 → 4326.72] to scare you
[4326.72 → 4327.68] because,
[4328.38 → 4328.68] honestly,
[4328.84 → 4330.04] I think most of us
[4330.04 → 4330.96] are already scared.
[4332.20 → 4333.12] Whether we admit it
[4333.12 → 4333.80] to ourselves or not,
[4333.80 → 4335.86] most of us live scared.
[4336.74 → 4338.78] The world lives scared.
[4339.48 → 4340.44] That's why things
[4340.44 → 4341.50] like paganism
[4341.50 → 4342.90] is filling the vacuum
[4342.90 → 4343.92] that's left
[4343.92 → 4345.64] in a post-Christian society
[4345.64 → 4347.84] because there's fear.
[4349.58 → 4350.60] A few years ago,
[4351.52 → 4353.26] I gave a lecture
[4353.26 → 4354.70] to a group of pastors
[4354.70 → 4356.02] and ministry leaders
[4356.02 → 4357.18] in St. Catherine.
[4357.32 → 4358.04] That's where my family
[4358.04 → 4358.58] moved from.
[4359.62 → 4360.72] And it was on the history
[4360.72 → 4362.06] of the early church
[4362.06 → 4363.46] and how they,
[4363.46 → 4364.68] not only just survived,
[4364.84 → 4365.86] but thrived
[4365.86 → 4367.64] and exponentially
[4367.64 → 4368.98] grew
[4368.98 → 4370.08] in the midst
[4370.08 → 4370.94] of persecution
[4370.94 → 4371.74] and in the midst
[4371.74 → 4373.42] of this pagan culture.
[4374.38 → 4374.74] Afterwards,
[4375.00 → 4377.50] we led a panel discussion.
[4377.58 → 4378.52] I led a panel discussion
[4378.52 → 4379.92] with a group of colleagues
[4379.92 → 4380.38] that I wrote
[4380.38 → 4381.30] this Bible study with,
[4381.40 → 4381.70] actually.
[4382.28 → 4383.60] We led a panel discussion
[4383.60 → 4384.02] and there,
[4384.88 → 4385.70] a woman stood up
[4385.70 → 4386.84] who does ministry
[4386.84 → 4388.42] to marginalized women
[4388.42 → 4389.88] in downtown St. Catherine's
[4389.88 → 4390.94] and she said,
[4391.94 → 4393.24] all people are looking
[4393.24 → 4395.06] for peace and power.
[4396.00 → 4397.22] Either they will find it
[4397.22 → 4398.02] in witchcraft
[4398.02 → 4399.32] or in Jesus.
[4400.40 → 4401.06] But what they find
[4401.06 → 4401.56] in Jesus
[4401.56 → 4402.90] is totally different
[4402.90 → 4403.94] than what they will find
[4403.94 → 4404.58] in witchcraft.
[4406.26 → 4407.08] But oh man,
[4407.14 → 4407.98] I think she's right.
[4408.98 → 4410.12] People are looking
[4410.12 → 4410.90] for peace
[4410.90 → 4412.20] and power.
[4412.20 → 4413.76] And why are people
[4413.76 → 4414.34] looking for peace
[4414.34 → 4414.82] and power?
[4415.12 → 4416.22] It's because we feel
[4416.22 → 4417.62] the chaos of disorder
[4417.62 → 4418.76] and we fear it.
[4419.48 → 4420.92] We feel the inability
[4420.92 → 4422.00] to face the future
[4422.00 → 4423.60] and we fear it.
[4425.20 → 4426.66] Peter is putting
[4426.66 → 4427.58] a choice
[4427.58 → 4428.80] in front of us.
[4430.42 → 4431.44] Saying fear
[4431.44 → 4433.10] or hope.
[4433.10 → 4434.84] And it can be
[4434.84 → 4436.10] that simple.
[4436.54 → 4436.94] Fear
[4436.94 → 4438.56] or hope.
[4439.50 → 4439.90] Fear
[4439.90 → 4441.92] in the future
[4441.92 → 4443.12] and of the future
[4443.12 → 4444.70] and of your place
[4444.70 → 4445.72] in the world.
[4446.60 → 4447.74] Or hope
[4447.74 → 4449.08] for the future
[4449.08 → 4450.16] and your purpose
[4450.16 → 4450.86] in the present.
[4452.22 → 4452.80] Because you see,
[4453.00 → 4455.20] it's only a sense
[4455.20 → 4455.96] of hope
[4455.96 → 4457.18] for the future
[4457.18 → 4458.46] that really fuels
[4458.46 → 4459.78] and fills
[4459.78 → 4461.34] a sense of purpose
[4461.34 → 4462.32] for the present.
[4463.10 → 4464.22] What you believe
[4464.22 → 4465.00] about the future
[4465.00 → 4465.76] determines
[4465.76 → 4466.88] what you do
[4466.88 → 4467.90] in the present
[4467.90 → 4470.36] and how you do it.
[4471.34 → 4472.22] And Peter is saying
[4472.22 → 4473.26] because you know
[4473.26 → 4474.02] the future,
[4474.64 → 4475.52] because you know
[4475.52 → 4477.16] that Jesus is returning
[4477.16 → 4478.36] and that all things
[4478.36 → 4479.60] will be made right,
[4479.72 → 4480.74] because you know
[4480.74 → 4482.42] that this seeming chaos
[4482.42 → 4483.90] will turn to order
[4483.90 → 4486.12] and that the mess
[4486.12 → 4488.02] of the crisscrossing
[4488.02 → 4489.10] paths before you
[4489.10 → 4489.94] will be revealed
[4489.94 → 4491.22] as the beauty
[4491.22 → 4492.66] of a fractal arrangement
[4492.66 → 4493.50] coming together
[4493.50 → 4494.36] in the tapestry
[4494.36 → 4495.14] of history
[4495.14 → 4495.98] directed only
[4495.98 → 4497.00] by a sovereign God.
[4497.18 → 4498.66] Because you know
[4498.66 → 4499.82] this truth,
[4500.62 → 4501.82] you can have hope.
[4503.36 → 4504.22] And hope
[4504.22 → 4505.10] for us
[4505.10 → 4506.54] who know this truth,
[4506.66 → 4507.30] hope for us
[4507.30 → 4508.26] who know this God
[4508.26 → 4510.74] looks a certain way.
[4510.74 → 4514.62] as obedient children
[4514.62 → 4516.12] do not conform
[4516.12 → 4517.20] to the evil desires
[4517.20 → 4517.68] you had
[4517.68 → 4518.26] when you lived
[4518.26 → 4519.02] in ignorance.
[4519.30 → 4519.82] Ignorance there
[4519.82 → 4520.44] meaning before
[4520.44 → 4521.32] you knew this hope.
[4522.42 → 4523.86] But just as he
[4523.86 → 4524.70] who called you
[4524.70 → 4525.36] is holy,
[4525.64 → 4526.74] so be holy
[4526.74 → 4527.92] in all you do.
[4528.40 → 4529.40] For it is written,
[4529.72 → 4530.34] be holy
[4530.34 → 4531.70] because I
[4531.70 → 4532.64] am
[4532.64 → 4533.70] holy.
[4533.70 → 4536.14] hope
[4536.14 → 4537.40] for the Christian
[4537.40 → 4538.60] looks like
[4538.60 → 4539.58] holiness
[4539.58 → 4541.02] in the present.
[4542.66 → 4543.08] And let's be
[4543.08 → 4544.10] really clear
[4544.10 → 4544.90] on the order
[4544.90 → 4545.56] here, right?
[4545.60 → 4545.80] Because
[4545.80 → 4546.74] paganism
[4546.74 → 4547.90] and all other
[4547.90 → 4548.54] religions,
[4548.68 → 4549.14] all other
[4549.14 → 4549.80] worldviews
[4549.80 → 4550.22] will put it
[4550.22 → 4550.64] this way.
[4550.92 → 4551.86] Do this
[4551.86 → 4552.30] and you'll
[4552.30 → 4553.20] get this reward.
[4554.24 → 4555.34] Behave this way,
[4555.48 → 4556.38] do this ritual,
[4556.60 → 4557.52] pray this prayer,
[4557.94 → 4558.74] empty yourself
[4558.74 → 4559.36] of this,
[4559.48 → 4559.96] offer up
[4559.96 → 4560.86] this sacrifice,
[4561.36 → 4562.46] work these hours,
[4562.66 → 4563.60] drink this cup,
[4563.70 → 4564.38] and you will
[4564.38 → 4565.10] get your peace
[4565.10 → 4566.06] and your power.
[4566.42 → 4567.02] Every other
[4567.02 → 4568.06] religion
[4568.06 → 4569.80] and worldview.
[4571.16 → 4571.60] Christianity
[4571.60 → 4573.58] is different.
[4574.76 → 4575.52] The gospel
[4575.52 → 4577.38] is different.
[4577.58 → 4578.48] The Bible
[4578.48 → 4580.60] is different.
[4582.98 → 4583.86] For you know
[4583.86 → 4584.42] that it is not
[4584.42 → 4585.36] with perishable
[4585.36 → 4586.08] things such as
[4586.08 → 4586.78] silver or gold
[4586.78 → 4587.24] that you were
[4587.24 → 4587.84] redeemed from
[4587.84 → 4588.80] the empty way
[4588.80 → 4589.56] of life handed
[4589.56 → 4590.12] down to you
[4590.12 → 4590.92] from your ancestors,
[4591.36 → 4592.60] but with the
[4592.60 → 4593.88] precious blood
[4593.88 → 4594.60] of Christ,
[4594.96 → 4595.62] a lamb
[4595.62 → 4596.74] without blemish
[4596.74 → 4597.94] or defect.
[4599.38 → 4600.12] He was chosen
[4600.12 → 4601.00] before the creation
[4601.00 → 4601.58] of the world,
[4601.76 → 4602.58] but was revealed
[4602.58 → 4603.80] in these last times
[4603.80 → 4604.58] for your sake.
[4604.96 → 4605.88] Through him
[4605.88 → 4607.10] you believe
[4607.10 → 4607.68] in God
[4607.68 → 4608.44] who raised him
[4608.44 → 4609.00] from the dead
[4609.00 → 4609.90] and glorified him
[4609.90 → 4611.50] so that your faith
[4611.50 → 4612.92] and hope
[4612.92 → 4615.26] are in God.
[4615.26 → 4619.82] hope in God
[4619.82 → 4621.00] is a gift
[4621.00 → 4622.36] of grace
[4622.36 → 4623.46] given to you
[4623.46 → 4624.26] because Jesus
[4624.26 → 4625.16] lived the life
[4625.16 → 4625.98] I should have lived
[4625.98 → 4627.26] and died the death
[4627.26 → 4628.66] that I deserved.
[4629.60 → 4630.24] So what is your
[4630.24 → 4631.26] source of peace?
[4631.80 → 4632.24] The death
[4632.24 → 4632.92] and the resurrection
[4632.92 → 4634.14] of Jesus.
[4634.26 → 4634.86] What is your source
[4634.86 → 4635.52] of power
[4635.52 → 4636.62] in this life?
[4636.72 → 4637.14] The death
[4637.14 → 4638.10] and the resurrection
[4638.10 → 4638.96] of Jesus.
[4639.04 → 4640.06] If we died with him
[4640.06 → 4640.72] we are also
[4640.72 → 4641.72] raised with him.
[4641.72 → 4642.88] Now, to be sure
[4642.88 → 4644.82] power looks different
[4644.82 → 4646.98] and so much different
[4646.98 → 4648.32] than what the world thinks
[4648.32 → 4649.70] because the power
[4649.70 → 4650.28] of the gospel
[4650.28 → 4650.90] is revealed
[4650.90 → 4652.04] in weakness.
[4652.80 → 4653.82] This power of God
[4653.82 → 4654.30] is revealed
[4654.30 → 4654.80] in a willingness
[4654.80 → 4655.44] to serve.
[4655.82 → 4656.36] This power
[4656.36 → 4657.24] is the washing
[4657.24 → 4657.82] of feet
[4657.82 → 4658.60] and the sitting
[4658.60 → 4659.54] with tax collectors
[4659.54 → 4660.68] and prostitutes.
[4661.02 → 4661.60] This power
[4661.60 → 4662.88] is foster parenting
[4662.88 → 4664.46] and night shift ministries.
[4664.62 → 4665.12] This power
[4665.12 → 4666.74] is M2W2.
[4666.92 → 4667.58] This power
[4667.58 → 4668.38] is not thinking
[4668.38 → 4669.08] of ourselves
[4669.08 → 4669.68] more highly
[4669.68 → 4670.22] than we ought
[4670.22 → 4670.64] but rather
[4670.64 → 4671.30] in humility
[4671.30 → 4672.28] considering others
[4672.28 → 4673.06] as greater
[4673.06 → 4674.06] than yourself.
[4674.50 → 4675.04] Holiness
[4675.04 → 4676.42] is being set apart
[4676.42 → 4677.30] in the world
[4677.30 → 4677.90] in ways
[4677.90 → 4678.68] that just won't
[4678.68 → 4679.30] make sense
[4679.30 → 4680.32] to the world.
[4681.88 → 4682.38] That's why
[4682.38 → 4683.18] the early church
[4683.18 → 4684.20] was ostracized
[4684.20 → 4685.08] and eventually
[4685.08 → 4686.24] prosecuted
[4686.24 → 4687.36] because it doesn't
[4687.36 → 4688.02] make sense
[4688.02 → 4689.00] to a people
[4689.00 → 4690.72] who don't know God
[4690.72 → 4691.64] and yet
[4691.64 → 4692.34] when you look
[4692.34 → 4692.92] at the history
[4692.92 → 4694.02] that's exactly
[4694.02 → 4695.58] why the early church
[4695.58 → 4697.32] grew in exponential
[4697.32 → 4698.30] ways
[4698.30 → 4699.84] because it didn't
[4699.84 → 4701.26] make sense.
[4701.30 → 4703.26] only God
[4703.26 → 4704.00] can do
[4704.00 → 4704.76] that
[4704.76 → 4706.88] and that's not
[4706.88 → 4707.42] going to make sense
[4707.42 → 4707.76] to people
[4707.76 → 4708.46] who don't know him
[4708.46 → 4710.20] and it should
[4710.20 → 4711.22] be that way.
[4712.50 → 4714.06] If my life
[4714.06 → 4715.44] makes sense
[4715.44 → 4716.30] to people
[4716.30 → 4717.06] who don't know
[4717.06 → 4717.44] Jesus
[4717.44 → 4719.74] what is the effect
[4719.74 → 4720.44] of knowing Jesus
[4720.44 → 4721.30] having on my life?
[4721.30 → 4726.38] I mentioned
[4726.38 → 4726.96] Elliot Clark
[4726.96 → 4727.38] already
[4727.38 → 4729.88] Elliot Clark
[4729.88 → 4732.58] was a missionary
[4732.58 → 4734.20] to Southeast
[4734.20 → 4735.42] to a country
[4735.42 → 4736.38] in Southeast Asia.
[4737.06 → 4738.04] He doesn't tell you
[4738.04 → 4738.46] what country
[4738.46 → 4739.30] because it's illegal
[4739.30 → 4740.02] to be a missionary
[4740.02 → 4740.68] where he was
[4740.68 → 4741.24] and there are still
[4741.24 → 4742.20] missionaries on the ground
[4742.20 → 4743.30] where he was
[4743.30 → 4744.84] and he tells a story
[4744.84 → 4746.10] of a man named Hassan
[4746.10 → 4747.36] who was a Muslim
[4747.36 → 4748.14] who was a friend
[4748.14 → 4748.76] of a friend
[4748.76 → 4749.40] of a friend
[4749.40 → 4750.72] while Elliot
[4750.72 → 4751.32] was there.
[4751.42 → 4752.26] They ran into each other
[4752.26 → 4752.88] a couple of times.
[4752.96 → 4753.32] They didn't know
[4753.32 → 4754.00] each other well
[4754.00 → 4756.60] but Hassan knew
[4756.60 → 4757.34] that Elliot
[4757.34 → 4758.04] was a Christian
[4758.04 → 4760.10] and Elliot knew
[4760.10 → 4760.62] that Hassan
[4760.62 → 4761.22] was a Muslim.
[4762.18 → 4762.84] Now in this part
[4762.84 → 4763.22] of the world
[4763.22 → 4764.00] and in many parts
[4764.00 → 4764.52] of the world
[4764.52 → 4766.36] Hassan is trained
[4766.36 → 4767.98] with all the answers
[4767.98 → 4768.92] and assumptions
[4768.92 → 4770.34] about what Christians
[4770.34 → 4771.68] supposedly believe.
[4771.68 → 4774.04] now eventually
[4774.04 → 4774.98] Elliot left
[4774.98 → 4776.66] that region
[4776.66 → 4777.98] and went back
[4777.98 → 4778.62] to the U.S.
[4778.64 → 4779.40] to do some work
[4779.40 → 4780.30] there.
[4781.32 → 4782.06] It happened
[4782.06 → 4783.74] that a few years later
[4783.74 → 4784.66] a year or so later
[4784.66 → 4785.90] one of his friends
[4785.90 → 4786.70] was getting married
[4786.70 → 4787.98] and so they went back
[4787.98 → 4789.04] to the place
[4789.04 → 4790.98] where they were
[4790.98 → 4792.12] to participate
[4792.12 → 4793.20] in that wedding
[4793.20 → 4794.34] and while Elliot
[4794.34 → 4795.04] was there
[4795.04 → 4796.58] Hassan
[4796.58 → 4797.58] reached out to him.
[4799.30 → 4800.14] It seemed random
[4800.14 → 4800.82] at first
[4800.82 → 4802.18] but he asked
[4802.18 → 4803.06] if they could have coffee
[4803.06 → 4805.40] and over the course
[4805.40 → 4806.28] of their conversation
[4806.28 → 4807.26] it came to a point
[4807.26 → 4808.42] where it was winding down
[4808.42 → 4809.62] and Elliot had been praying
[4809.62 → 4810.46] and saying
[4810.46 → 4811.36] I need to do something
[4811.36 → 4811.78] with this
[4811.78 → 4812.30] I need to use
[4812.30 → 4812.94] this opportunity
[4812.94 → 4814.16] and so finally
[4814.16 → 4815.16] he asked Hassan
[4815.16 → 4816.02] what do you think
[4816.02 → 4816.64] I believe?
[4817.78 → 4818.46] And so began
[4818.46 → 4819.94] a two-hour conversation
[4819.94 → 4820.86] back and forth
[4820.86 → 4822.04] about Hassan saying
[4822.04 → 4822.62] well this is what
[4822.62 → 4823.24] Christians believe
[4823.24 → 4824.44] and then Clark
[4824.44 → 4825.16] being able to say
[4825.16 → 4825.52] well no
[4825.52 → 4826.28] this is actually
[4826.28 → 4826.96] what we believe.
[4827.26 → 4828.14] At the end of that
[4828.14 → 4829.90] Elliot Clark says
[4829.90 → 4831.22] Hassan asked
[4831.22 → 4831.88] the question
[4831.88 → 4833.10] why didn't you
[4833.10 → 4834.10] tell me this
[4834.10 → 4835.22] was what you believed
[4835.22 → 4835.92] when you were here?
[4836.86 → 4838.14] Now you have to leave.
[4838.80 → 4839.62] Had you told me this
[4839.62 → 4840.18] when you were here
[4840.18 → 4840.70] we could have had
[4840.70 → 4841.46] way more time
[4841.46 → 4842.34] to talk about it.
[4844.84 → 4845.74] That moment
[4845.74 → 4846.86] Clark reflects on
[4846.86 → 4847.46] in his book
[4847.46 → 4849.00] and he admits
[4849.00 → 4850.56] that it was fear
[4850.56 → 4854.84] and his response
[4854.84 → 4856.26] his learning
[4856.26 → 4857.06] from that
[4857.06 → 4857.86] is actually
[4857.86 → 4858.70] recognizing
[4858.70 → 4859.92] a greater
[4859.92 → 4860.74] fear
[4860.74 → 4861.44] right
[4861.44 → 4861.96] the fear
[4861.96 → 4862.60] of God
[4862.60 → 4863.68] a reverence
[4863.68 → 4864.18] for him
[4864.18 → 4865.20] that has to trump
[4865.20 → 4866.82] all those other fears
[4866.82 → 4868.78] that's the source
[4868.78 → 4869.90] of your hope
[4869.90 → 4871.04] that leads to
[4871.04 → 4871.76] holiness
[4871.76 → 4872.76] that enables you
[4872.76 → 4873.36] to talk
[4873.36 → 4874.42] in those moments
[4874.42 → 4875.14] where you will be
[4875.14 → 4875.90] the odd one out
[4875.90 → 4876.68] where you will be
[4876.68 → 4877.30] ostracized
[4877.30 → 4877.82] where you will
[4877.82 → 4878.96] have an impact
[4878.96 → 4880.34] of professing
[4880.34 → 4881.04] your faith
[4881.04 → 4882.46] in Jesus Christ
[4882.46 → 4884.66] it's a reverence
[4884.66 → 4885.82] for God
[4885.82 → 4890.56] that's the source
[4890.56 → 4891.10] of hope
[4891.10 → 4892.16] that leads
[4892.16 → 4892.68] to holiness
[4892.68 → 4895.10] and holiness
[4895.10 → 4895.72] too
[4895.72 → 4897.06] looks a certain
[4897.06 → 4897.52] way
[4897.52 → 4898.50] for us
[4898.50 → 4899.76] in the church
[4899.76 → 4901.94] look at verse 22
[4901.94 → 4903.98] now that you have
[4903.98 → 4905.06] purified yourselves
[4905.06 → 4906.30] by obeying the truth
[4906.30 → 4907.08] so that you have
[4907.08 → 4908.12] sincere love
[4908.12 → 4909.10] for each other
[4909.10 → 4910.62] love one another
[4910.62 → 4911.24] deeply
[4911.24 → 4912.98] from the heart
[4912.98 → 4915.82] let me ask you this
[4915.82 → 4917.96] in a world
[4917.96 → 4918.96] that is so
[4918.96 → 4919.72] clearly
[4919.72 → 4920.98] and deeply
[4920.98 → 4922.06] divided
[4922.06 → 4923.96] and only
[4923.96 → 4924.82] every day
[4924.82 → 4925.54] becoming more
[4925.54 → 4926.08] and more
[4926.08 → 4927.16] polarized
[4927.16 → 4929.74] when people's
[4929.74 → 4930.96] normal practice
[4930.96 → 4931.82] on Facebook
[4931.82 → 4933.10] is muting
[4933.10 → 4933.76] conversations
[4933.76 → 4934.58] because they don't
[4934.58 → 4934.94] want to hear
[4934.94 → 4935.48] from that person
[4935.48 → 4935.86] anymore
[4935.86 → 4937.54] but they also
[4937.54 → 4938.02] don't want the
[4938.02 → 4938.56] social impact
[4938.56 → 4939.04] of deleting
[4939.04 → 4939.64] that person
[4939.64 → 4942.30] what sort
[4942.30 → 4943.20] of witness
[4943.20 → 4944.50] can a church
[4944.50 → 4945.10] community
[4945.10 → 4946.76] that is genuinely
[4946.76 → 4947.84] sincerely
[4947.84 → 4948.96] is Peter's word
[4948.96 → 4949.44] in that verse
[4949.44 → 4950.40] sincerely
[4950.40 → 4952.20] loving one another
[4952.20 → 4953.28] deeply
[4953.28 → 4955.44] love one another
[4955.44 → 4956.26] deeply
[4956.26 → 4957.18] from
[4957.18 → 4957.86] the
[4957.86 → 4958.80] heart
[4958.80 → 4961.00] that doesn't mean
[4961.00 → 4961.66] we all agree
[4961.66 → 4963.34] but it does mean
[4963.34 → 4964.12] we all get together
[4964.12 → 4965.44] it doesn't mean
[4965.44 → 4965.98] we all think
[4965.98 → 4966.46] the same
[4966.46 → 4967.82] but it does mean
[4967.82 → 4968.26] that we think
[4968.26 → 4968.70] together
[4968.70 → 4970.34] it doesn't mean
[4970.34 → 4970.70] that we all
[4970.70 → 4972.70] live and laugh
[4972.70 → 4973.86] and love
[4973.86 → 4974.62] you know
[4974.62 → 4975.48] around dining
[4975.48 → 4976.22] tables together
[4976.22 → 4977.26] but some of us do
[4977.26 → 4978.32] and we do come
[4978.32 → 4979.30] around this table
[4979.30 → 4979.98] together
[4979.98 → 4981.84] right
[4981.84 → 4982.48] in a world
[4982.48 → 4982.94] that is so
[4982.94 → 4984.24] deeply divided
[4984.24 → 4985.64] and is intentionally
[4985.64 → 4986.80] being fractured
[4986.80 → 4987.62] over and over
[4987.62 → 4988.30] and over again
[4988.30 → 4989.44] what might it look
[4989.44 → 4990.02] like for us
[4990.02 → 4990.66] as a church
[4990.66 → 4991.52] to love
[4991.52 → 4992.20] one another
[4992.20 → 4993.00] from the heart
[4993.00 → 4993.56] because make no
[4993.56 → 4994.18] mistake about it
[4994.18 → 4994.96] this word
[4994.96 → 4995.74] of loving one another
[4995.74 → 4996.20] from the heart
[4996.20 → 4997.74] isn't a general word
[4997.74 → 4999.18] to people
[4999.18 → 5000.04] and humanity
[5000.04 → 5000.88] this is a word
[5000.88 → 5002.34] to a local
[5002.34 → 5004.18] gathered church
[5004.18 → 5007.14] love
[5007.14 → 5008.38] one another
[5008.38 → 5010.08] deeply
[5010.08 → 5014.86] that's what I want
[5014.86 → 5015.26] for you
[5015.26 → 5017.56] to be frank
[5017.56 → 5017.98] that's what I want
[5017.98 → 5018.52] from you
[5018.52 → 5021.32] how do we get that
[5021.32 → 5023.18] how do we become that
[5023.18 → 5024.90] you know
[5024.90 → 5026.32] again if you
[5026.32 → 5027.46] if you study the early
[5027.46 → 5027.90] church
[5027.90 → 5028.38] one of the
[5028.38 → 5029.26] the reasons
[5029.26 → 5030.66] why they were able
[5030.66 → 5031.50] to thrive
[5031.50 → 5032.64] in persecution
[5032.64 → 5034.02] and chaos
[5034.02 → 5035.62] when they did
[5035.62 → 5036.66] and how they did
[5036.66 → 5037.58] is because
[5037.58 → 5038.54] they took
[5038.54 → 5039.16] God
[5039.16 → 5040.48] at his
[5040.48 → 5041.20] word
[5041.20 → 5042.72] they really
[5042.72 → 5043.18] believe
[5043.18 → 5043.82] that God
[5043.82 → 5044.42] spoke
[5044.42 → 5044.92] and God
[5044.92 → 5045.60] speaks
[5045.60 → 5047.10] in his
[5047.10 → 5047.84] word
[5047.84 → 5049.46] that the gospel
[5049.46 → 5050.06] message
[5050.06 → 5050.62] really
[5050.62 → 5051.42] can
[5051.42 → 5052.46] transform
[5052.46 → 5053.54] lives
[5053.54 → 5056.14] that this is the source
[5056.14 → 5056.82] of God's
[5056.82 → 5057.60] working
[5057.60 → 5058.66] in the world
[5058.66 → 5059.30] right here
[5059.30 → 5059.66] his
[5059.66 → 5060.68] word
[5060.68 → 5062.88] for you
[5062.88 → 5063.54] have been born
[5063.54 → 5063.86] again
[5063.86 → 5065.02] not of perishable
[5065.02 → 5065.40] seed
[5065.40 → 5066.58] but of imperishable
[5066.58 → 5067.94] through the living
[5067.94 → 5068.86] and enduring
[5068.86 → 5069.92] word
[5069.92 → 5070.76] of
[5070.76 → 5071.62] God
[5071.62 → 5072.30] for all people
[5072.30 → 5073.12] are like glass
[5073.12 → 5073.84] grass
[5073.84 → 5074.70] and all their glory
[5074.70 → 5075.46] is like flowers
[5075.46 → 5076.16] of the field
[5076.16 → 5076.78] the grass
[5076.78 → 5077.46] withers
[5077.46 → 5078.16] the flowers
[5078.16 → 5078.76] fall
[5078.76 → 5079.84] but the word
[5079.84 → 5080.90] of the Lord
[5080.90 → 5082.06] endures
[5082.06 → 5083.32] forever
[5083.32 → 5086.08] living hope
[5086.08 → 5087.18] looks like
[5087.18 → 5088.52] living holiness
[5088.52 → 5089.70] because of
[5089.70 → 5090.26] the living
[5090.26 → 5091.10] word
[5091.10 → 5092.82] live the word
[5092.82 → 5093.18] of God
[5093.18 → 5093.78] and you will
[5093.78 → 5094.24] actually
[5094.24 → 5094.82] finally
[5094.82 → 5095.52] for the first
[5095.52 → 5095.92] time
[5095.92 → 5096.62] live
[5096.62 → 5097.66] live the word
[5097.66 → 5098.12] and you will
[5098.12 → 5098.50] actually
[5098.50 → 5099.36] for the first
[5099.36 → 5099.64] time
[5099.64 → 5100.24] love
[5100.24 → 5101.16] live the word
[5101.16 → 5101.54] and you will
[5101.54 → 5101.96] actually
[5101.96 → 5102.76] maybe for the
[5102.76 → 5103.24] first time
[5103.24 → 5104.54] live hopeful
[5104.54 → 5105.50] and not
[5105.50 → 5106.88] in fear
[5106.88 → 5110.76] earlier I talked
[5110.76 → 5111.34] about the culture
[5111.34 → 5112.02] around us
[5112.02 → 5112.74] being the air
[5112.74 → 5113.46] we breathe
[5113.46 → 5114.54] and the water
[5114.54 → 5115.36] we swim in
[5115.36 → 5117.08] it's time
[5117.08 → 5117.64] to change
[5117.64 → 5118.22] the air
[5118.22 → 5119.26] by letting
[5119.26 → 5119.78] the breath
[5119.78 → 5120.36] of God
[5120.36 → 5121.06] come into
[5121.06 → 5121.44] you
[5121.44 → 5121.94] through
[5121.94 → 5122.74] his
[5122.74 → 5123.52] word
[5123.52 → 5124.66] or change
[5124.66 → 5125.14] the water
[5125.14 → 5125.78] that we swim
[5125.78 → 5125.98] in
[5125.98 → 5126.52] by letting
[5126.52 → 5127.34] the living
[5127.34 → 5128.04] water
[5128.04 → 5128.92] come into
[5128.92 → 5129.12] you
[5129.12 → 5129.68] immerse
[5129.68 → 5130.28] yourself
[5130.28 → 5130.80] in
[5130.80 → 5131.46] God's
[5131.46 → 5131.94] word
[5131.94 → 5132.38] I can't
[5132.38 → 5132.74] stress
[5132.74 → 5133.42] this enough
[5133.42 → 5135.20] let me put
[5135.20 → 5135.56] it this way
[5135.56 → 5137.18] when Jesus
[5137.18 → 5137.62] was
[5137.62 → 5138.98] after his
[5138.98 → 5139.40] baptism
[5139.40 → 5140.02] he was taken
[5140.02 → 5140.76] out into
[5140.76 → 5141.28] the wilderness
[5141.28 → 5141.90] and he was
[5141.90 → 5142.46] tempted by
[5142.46 → 5143.00] the devil
[5143.00 → 5143.42] you remember
[5143.42 → 5144.06] this story
[5144.06 → 5145.24] he was tempted
[5145.24 → 5145.84] by the devil
[5145.84 → 5146.84] three times
[5146.84 → 5147.16] the devil
[5147.16 → 5147.64] came to him
[5147.64 → 5147.86] and said
[5147.86 → 5148.26] well what about
[5148.26 → 5148.72] this and what
[5148.72 → 5149.12] about this
[5149.12 → 5149.32] and what
[5149.32 → 5149.68] about this
[5149.68 → 5150.36] and every
[5150.36 → 5150.68] time
[5150.68 → 5151.00] what did
[5151.00 → 5151.58] Jesus do
[5151.58 → 5153.78] he quoted
[5153.78 → 5154.50] the bible
[5154.50 → 5156.52] the living
[5156.52 → 5157.16] word
[5157.16 → 5157.96] quoted
[5157.96 → 5159.04] the living
[5159.04 → 5159.74] and enduring
[5159.74 → 5160.26] word
[5160.26 → 5161.06] and defeated
[5161.06 → 5161.54] the devil
[5161.54 → 5162.36] pushed back
[5162.36 → 5162.82] the devil
[5162.82 → 5164.54] that's
[5164.54 → 5164.74] what
[5164.74 → 5165.16] God's
[5165.16 → 5165.44] word
[5165.44 → 5166.20] can do
[5166.20 → 5167.00] for us
[5167.00 → 5167.58] and in
[5167.58 → 5167.78] you
[5167.78 → 5168.32] and through
[5168.32 → 5168.60] you
[5168.60 → 5169.10] to the
[5169.10 → 5169.36] world
[5169.36 → 5172.86] this
[5172.86 → 5174.26] is
[5174.26 → 5175.02] your
[5175.02 → 5175.50] peace
[5175.50 → 5176.36] and your
[5176.36 → 5176.88] power
[5176.88 → 5177.90] because this
[5177.90 → 5178.52] is where
[5178.52 → 5179.00] you will
[5179.00 → 5179.46] see
[5179.46 → 5180.38] and hear
[5180.38 → 5181.48] Jesus
[5181.48 → 5183.82] this
[5183.82 → 5185.10] is the
[5185.10 → 5185.42] word
[5185.42 → 5185.76] that was
[5185.76 → 5186.16] preached
[5186.16 → 5187.50] Peter's
[5187.50 → 5188.10] audience
[5188.10 → 5189.76] this
[5189.76 → 5190.56] is the
[5190.56 → 5190.82] word

[5508.66 → 5514.12] This table, we are united not only with God, but also with each other.
[5515.62 → 5521.24] As at his last supper, the Lord Jesus took bread.
[5522.20 → 5524.88] And when he had given thanks, he broke it.
[5525.66 → 5529.90] And he said, this is my body, which is for you.
[5530.94 → 5533.56] Do this in remembrance of me.
[5533.56 → 5538.56] In the same way, he took the cup after supper.
[5539.52 → 5543.62] And he said, this cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[5544.64 → 5547.82] Do this in remembrance of me.
[5548.52 → 5557.48] For whenever we eat this bread and drink this cup, we proclaim the Lord's death and resurrection until he comes again.
[5557.48 → 5565.78] Therefore, we proclaim our faith as signed and sealed in this sacrament.
[5565.78 → 5583.08] Church family, the Lord has prepared his table for all who love him and trust in him alone for their salvation.
