[1312.74 --> 1316.50]  And to our God, for He will freely pardon.
[1316.50 --> 1317.76]  Let's sing.
[1317.76 --> 1339.80]  In the darkness we were waiting, with our hope, without light.
[1339.80 --> 1347.12]  Till from heaven you came run, there was mercy in your eyes.
[1347.24 --> 1354.00]  To fulfill the law and prophets, to the virgin we know were.
[1354.44 --> 1360.94]  From a throne of endless glory, to a cradle in the dirt.
[1360.94 --> 1381.42]  Praise the Father, praise the Son, praise the Spirit, free in love.
[1381.42 --> 1395.86]  God of glory, majesty, praise the King of King.
[1395.86 --> 1396.42]  Amen.
[1400.42 --> 1407.76]  To reveal the kingdom for you and to reconcile the lost.
[1407.76 --> 1414.50]  To redeem the whole creation, you did not despise the cross.
[1414.50 --> 1421.38]  For even in your suffering, you talked to the other side.
[1421.66 --> 1428.50]  Knowing this was our salvation, Jesus for us if you died.
[1428.50 --> 1444.38]  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Son, praise the Spirit,
[1444.38 --> 1448.38]  We are now
[1448.38 --> 1454.38]  God of glory, majesty
[1454.38 --> 1461.38]  Praise forever to the King of King
[1462.38 --> 1470.44]  And the morning that you rose
[1470.44 --> 1473.38]  All of heaven held its breath
[1473.38 --> 1477.38]  Till the storm was moved for good
[1477.38 --> 1481.38]  For the Lamb had conquered death
[1481.38 --> 1484.38]  And the dead rose from their tombs
[1484.38 --> 1488.38]  And the angels stood in awe
[1488.38 --> 1491.38]  For the souls of all who come
[1491.38 --> 1495.38]  To the Father who restored
[1495.38 --> 1498.38]  And the church of Christ was born
[1498.38 --> 1502.38]  Heaven is here and yet so full
[1502.38 --> 1505.38]  God is blessed to the Lord
[1505.38 --> 1508.38]  Share my name, share my faith
[1508.38 --> 1512.38]  God is blind and in His name
[1512.38 --> 1515.38]  In His reign, in my every
[1515.38 --> 1519.38]  God of glory, God of glory, God of glory
[1519.38 --> 1521.38]  God of glory, Jesus Christ
[1521.38 --> 1527.38]  Jesus Christ
[1527.38 --> 1531.38]  Jesus Christ
[1531.38 --> 1537.38]  Praise the Father, praise the King
[1537.38 --> 1539.38]  Praise the Father, praise the King
[1539.38 --> 1541.38]  And the King of King
[1541.38 --> 1551.38]  God of glory, God of glory, God of glory
[1551.38 --> 1561.38]  For the King of glory, God of glory, God of glory
[1561.38 --> 1568.38]  And Him, and He yet
[1568.38 --> 1576.20]  God of glory, majesty.
[1577.88 --> 1584.38]  Praise forever to the King of kings.
[1585.06 --> 1592.46]  Praise forever to the King of kings.
[1592.46 --> 1599.68]  Our next song is one of the kids' favorites, I think.
[1599.78 --> 1600.82]  It's called Stronger.
[1601.24 --> 1603.66]  So for those of you kids that remember the actions,
[1603.98 --> 1605.18]  I'd love to see them.
[1622.46 --> 1638.66]  There is love that came for us,
[1639.10 --> 1643.54]  Humbled to the sinner's cross.
[1643.96 --> 1647.46]  He broke my shame and sinfulness.
[1647.46 --> 1653.62]  He rose again and tore in love.
[1656.56 --> 1660.96]  Joyfulness none can deny.
[1661.80 --> 1666.16]  Through the storm and through the fire,
[1666.78 --> 1671.46]  There is truth that sets me free,
[1671.46 --> 1676.78]  Jesus Christ who lives in me.
[1677.46 --> 1683.98]  You are stronger, you are stronger,
[1684.56 --> 1689.14]  Sin is broken, you have saved me.
[1689.54 --> 1693.94]  He is broken, Christ is broken,
[1693.94 --> 1699.50]  Jesus who is the Lord of all.
[1699.50 --> 1704.52]  You're敢 closer, you are stronger, You are stronger,
[1704.52 --> 1708.54]  You are stronger, you are stronger, You are stronger, You are stronger, oh.
[1708.54 --> 1709.88]  You are stronger, you are stronger, you are stronger,
[1709.94 --> 1712.34]  You are stronger, you are stronger, you are stronger, you are stronger, you are stronger.
[1712.34 --> 1716.30]  My hope and my difference
[1716.30 --> 1721.48]  He came to see and save us
[1721.48 --> 1727.94]  He faded off upon the cross
[1727.94 --> 1734.12]  You are stronger, you are stronger
[1734.12 --> 1739.40]  Sin is broken, you have saved me
[1739.40 --> 1744.18]  He is risen, Christ is risen
[1744.18 --> 1750.50]  Jesus, you are Lord of all
[1750.50 --> 1760.32]  So let your name be lifted higher
[1760.32 --> 1767.72]  So let your name be lifted higher
[1767.72 --> 1781.34]  So let your name be lifted higher
[1781.34 --> 1786.10]  So let your name be lifted higher
[1786.10 --> 1803.74]  You are stronger, you are stronger, sin is broken, you have saved me.
[1803.74 --> 1813.84]  It is risen, Christ is risen, Jesus, you are Lord of all.
[1813.84 --> 1823.66]  You are stronger, you are stronger, sin is broken, you have saved me.
[1823.66 --> 1834.56]  It is risen, Christ is risen, Jesus, you are Lord of all.
[1835.56 --> 1836.78]  You may have a seat.
[1836.78 --> 1848.00]  I'm going to invite all of the kids.
[1848.00 --> 1853.54]  You can come forward and come sit down here at the front somewhere, nice and safe.
[1854.00 --> 1857.82]  I'm going to sit up here and we're going to do a little kid's corner, okay?
[1857.96 --> 1860.52]  So come find a nice spot on the floor in front.
[1860.62 --> 1864.02]  We've got lots of room, so come on down.
[1864.14 --> 1865.82]  If you're comfortable, you don't have to.
[1865.82 --> 1868.50]  I don't want to force anyone, but look at this.
[1868.58 --> 1869.80]  We have people here.
[1870.42 --> 1872.14]  This is so great.
[1874.14 --> 1874.98]  All right.
[1875.80 --> 1876.96]  Should we do some kid's corner?
[1878.34 --> 1878.76]  Hey!
[1880.60 --> 1883.46]  Look who it is!
[1884.38 --> 1885.54]  Who is this?
[1886.52 --> 1887.62]  Hi, everybody!
[1888.74 --> 1891.20]  Hank, you seem so much less nervous today.
[1891.56 --> 1892.80]  I am!
[1893.34 --> 1893.94]  Why, Hank?
[1893.94 --> 1895.78]  I went to Toastmasters!
[1897.42 --> 1897.82]  Toastmasters?
[1897.94 --> 1900.58]  I'm not positive that's completely helpful for this situation.
[1900.76 --> 1901.70]  Well, it helped me!
[1902.18 --> 1902.78]  That's so great.
[1902.82 --> 1903.64]  Who do we have here?
[1904.20 --> 1906.04]  It looks like some kids.
[1906.76 --> 1907.14]  Yeah.
[1907.48 --> 1908.30]  We have kids here.
[1908.36 --> 1909.16]  This is kid's corner.
[1909.22 --> 1910.14]  We do this for the kids.
[1911.14 --> 1911.58]  Oh!
[1911.58 --> 1915.30]  I thought we did it for the camera.
[1915.30 --> 1916.00]  I know.
[1916.10 --> 1916.56]  You know what?
[1916.90 --> 1920.48]  It seemed like that for a good year, but the kids were behind the camera, and so we were
[1920.48 --> 1921.22]  talking to them.
[1921.64 --> 1922.04]  Oh!
[1922.46 --> 1923.62]  Well, hello, everyone.
[1925.80 --> 1926.88]  They're really quiet.
[1927.32 --> 1928.20]  They are very quiet.
[1928.28 --> 1928.90]  Should we try again?
[1929.30 --> 1929.56]  Yeah.
[1930.08 --> 1931.18]  Hello, everyone!
[1931.18 --> 1931.66]  Oh!
[1931.66 --> 1932.30]  They're loud!
[1933.66 --> 1934.74]  Oh, they're really loud!
[1935.30 --> 1936.66]  Yeah, they are very loud.
[1936.92 --> 1937.98]  It's so good to see you guys.
[1938.06 --> 1938.24]  How?
[1938.32 --> 1939.24]  Are you ready for the summer?
[1939.84 --> 1940.24]  Yeah!
[1940.34 --> 1940.58]  Yeah?
[1940.68 --> 1941.52]  You're ready for the summer?
[1941.64 --> 1942.20]  School's over.
[1942.28 --> 1944.88]  Are you so happy that we're in church today with people?
[1945.18 --> 1946.44]  Do you know there's still some people at home?
[1946.52 --> 1947.80]  Should we say hi to the people at home?
[1948.40 --> 1950.66]  Can we stand up for a second and wave at the camera in the back?
[1951.28 --> 1951.46]  Yeah?
[1951.94 --> 1952.24]  Wave.
[1952.36 --> 1953.24]  Hi, everyone at home.
[1953.28 --> 1953.70]  It's right there.
[1953.74 --> 1954.44]  Say hi, everyone.
[1955.60 --> 1955.92]  Yeah.
[1956.68 --> 1957.00]  All right.
[1957.08 --> 1958.36]  So we're going to do something today.
[1958.62 --> 1962.24]  Some of you have children's worship time that you're going to head off into the back.
[1962.30 --> 1965.96]  If you're preschool and younger, you can head to the children's worship time today, right?
[1966.02 --> 1966.32]  Preschool?
[1966.82 --> 1967.18]  Kindergarten.
[1967.28 --> 1967.42]  Sorry.
[1967.72 --> 1968.08]  Kindergarten.
[1968.18 --> 1968.62]  Nora knows.
[1968.80 --> 1969.74]  I should just ask Nora.
[1970.12 --> 1970.64]  Nora knows.
[1971.24 --> 1973.20]  So we're going to go kindergarten and younger.
[1973.28 --> 1974.66]  You can go to children's worship time.
[1974.76 --> 1979.58]  But before we do that, I'm going to pray, and then we're going to do the kid's blessing.
[1979.58 --> 1983.18]  How many of you remember the kid's blessing, the children's blessing from before?
[1983.44 --> 1984.22]  Anybody remember?
[1984.62 --> 1984.84]  Good.
[1984.90 --> 1985.22]  You know what?
[1985.24 --> 1985.76]  That's great.
[1985.76 --> 1988.76]  We're going to teach it again today because we're going to try to get into that rhythm
[1988.76 --> 1989.26]  again, okay?
[1989.66 --> 1992.68]  So I'm going to pray, and then we're going to do the kid's blessing.
[1992.78 --> 1993.28]  I'll teach you.
[1993.34 --> 1995.34]  And congregation, we have some things to learn, too, today.
[1995.94 --> 1998.82]  And then we're going to go to children's worship time, okay?
[1999.00 --> 2001.98]  So why don't we pray, and then we'll do that.
[2002.22 --> 2002.72]  Sound good, Hank?
[2002.88 --> 2003.46]  Sounds good.
[2003.58 --> 2004.22]  Sounds good, kids?
[2005.06 --> 2005.42]  Good.
[2005.50 --> 2005.70]  Perfect.
[2005.92 --> 2006.06]  Okay.
[2006.10 --> 2006.42]  Let's pray.
[2007.12 --> 2011.22]  Dear God, thank you so much that we are able to be in church today in person.
[2011.34 --> 2014.22]  We are so grateful that the restrictions have been lifted so that we can be here.
[2014.22 --> 2016.40]  Thank you for each one of these kids who's here.
[2016.50 --> 2018.14]  Thank you for all the kids who are at home as well.
[2018.54 --> 2022.06]  And God, we just pray that you will be near each and every one of them and help them grow
[2022.06 --> 2023.64]  closer and closer to you.
[2024.10 --> 2026.16]  We pray this in your son's precious name.
[2026.36 --> 2026.58]  Amen.
[2027.26 --> 2027.46]  Okay.
[2027.58 --> 2031.52]  So for the children's blessing, we're going to stand up.
[2031.56 --> 2032.72]  So we're going to stand up like this.
[2032.76 --> 2033.48]  I'll come down on the floor.
[2033.90 --> 2035.08]  And I'm going to put Hank down.
[2035.14 --> 2035.80]  Say bye to Hank.
[2036.24 --> 2037.22]  Bye, Hank.
[2037.30 --> 2038.16]  Bye, kids.
[2038.20 --> 2039.06]  I'll see you later.
[2039.06 --> 2041.60]  All right.
[2041.74 --> 2043.40]  So we're going to face the congregation.
[2044.30 --> 2045.52]  And then we're going to say this.
[2045.60 --> 2048.16]  We're going to say, we're going to put our hands up and we're going to say, the Lord
[2048.16 --> 2049.00]  be with you.
[2049.40 --> 2049.76]  All right.
[2049.92 --> 2051.42]  And we're going to say that to the congregation.
[2051.42 --> 2054.84]  And then the congregation, who's going to stand in a moment, are going to say it back.
[2054.88 --> 2055.12]  Okay.
[2055.18 --> 2055.90]  Does that make sense?
[2056.18 --> 2057.58]  So want to practice to me for a second?
[2057.88 --> 2061.70]  So put your hands up and say, the Lord be with you.
[2061.82 --> 2062.14]  Perfect.
[2062.26 --> 2062.44]  Okay.
[2062.44 --> 2063.10]  We're ready, I think.
[2063.10 --> 2063.26]  Okay.
[2063.48 --> 2064.38]  Congregation, up you get.
[2065.72 --> 2065.92]  Okay.
[2065.98 --> 2067.72]  Everybody turn around and look at the church.
[2067.86 --> 2068.60]  Look at all the people.
[2069.06 --> 2071.02]  And put your hands up and let's say together.
[2071.66 --> 2072.26]  Oh, wait, church.
[2072.30 --> 2073.02]  Do you know what to say?
[2073.10 --> 2073.74]  We didn't practice.
[2074.38 --> 2074.86]  We do?
[2074.96 --> 2075.12]  Okay.
[2075.18 --> 2075.38]  Good.
[2075.48 --> 2075.64]  Okay.
[2075.66 --> 2075.98]  We're good.
[2076.12 --> 2076.28]  Okay.
[2076.40 --> 2076.88]  Okay, kids.
[2076.92 --> 2077.10]  You ready?
[2077.52 --> 2077.80]  Together.
[2078.08 --> 2078.82]  One, two, three.
[2079.38 --> 2081.30]  The Lord be with you.
[2081.88 --> 2083.34]  And also with you.
[2083.40 --> 2083.68]  Awesome.
[2083.78 --> 2084.00]  Okay.
[2084.06 --> 2086.96]  If you are kindergarten or younger, you can head off to children's worship time.
[2087.14 --> 2088.86]  If you're older than that, you can head to your seats.
[2089.06 --> 2091.72]  And while they're heading off, I have a quick announcement to make, too.
[2092.26 --> 2093.72]  I'm going to stand over here to do that, though.
[2093.72 --> 2094.12]  Is that okay?
[2095.44 --> 2096.66]  Oh, we're going on stage.
[2096.76 --> 2097.76]  That's what I've been told to do.
[2097.88 --> 2098.64]  Follow in directions.
[2100.00 --> 2100.36]  There.
[2100.42 --> 2100.96]  We got a thumbs up.
[2101.06 --> 2104.16]  So, as you just saw, we have kids in this church.
[2104.40 --> 2105.16]  And they are lovely.
[2105.50 --> 2106.26]  And they are amazing.
[2106.34 --> 2106.90]  And it's awesome.
[2107.34 --> 2110.58]  We are looking for a children's worship time coordinator.
[2111.24 --> 2114.78]  Actually, we're looking for about two or three people to team up and be the children's
[2114.78 --> 2116.62]  time coordinator starting in September.
[2116.62 --> 2120.66]  A big blessing of that is you get to work with these wonderful kids.
[2120.76 --> 2122.08]  There's a lot more than that, as well.
[2122.58 --> 2126.24]  You'll be running the program sort of from preschool to grade four.
[2126.24 --> 2130.78]  I have been sort of overseeing this for the last 13 years.
[2130.78 --> 2137.36]  More importantly, my wife, Nikki, Suzanne Reesaboss, and Amanda Verkike have done it for a long time before that.
[2137.44 --> 2139.98]  But all of them are stepping down or have stepped down.
[2140.20 --> 2141.94]  And this is such an important ministry of the church.
[2142.22 --> 2147.58]  We are really looking for two to three more people to step up to coordinate children's worship time starting in September.
[2147.58 --> 2152.36]  But really starting now because then you can work with me and we can kind of problem solve some stuff for the summer.
[2152.60 --> 2154.32]  Work on getting volunteers and teachers.
[2154.50 --> 2156.86]  We've got a long list of people who definitely serve this ministry.
[2157.12 --> 2158.18]  But they're looking for a leader.
[2158.36 --> 2163.74]  So, if that is something that's on your heart, if that's something that you're sitting at home and think you can do as well, please touch base with me.
[2164.14 --> 2166.78]  And the sooner the better so that we can prep during the summer.
[2167.16 --> 2173.08]  If we let this wait until September or the middle of September, it's going to be a lot packed into a little amount of time.
[2173.08 --> 2178.14]  So, if that's something that's on your heart, something that you think you can serve and help out with, please come chat with me.
[2178.44 --> 2179.60]  This is such a wonderful ministry.
[2179.72 --> 2182.10]  These kids, they're just lovely.
[2182.20 --> 2183.00]  They're lovely to work with.
[2183.10 --> 2184.86]  It gets you a chance to really get to know them.
[2185.18 --> 2187.08]  And I promise you that will be a huge blessing to you as well.
[2187.16 --> 2189.18]  So, please think about serving in that way.
[2189.32 --> 2189.60]  Thank you.
[2203.08 --> 2204.90]  Good morning.
[2206.04 --> 2206.98]  My name is Dave.
[2207.08 --> 2209.18]  I am the deacon here at Emanuel CRC.
[2210.30 --> 2211.26]  Today's offering.
[2211.48 --> 2217.06]  As we proceed with this morning's worship, we set time aside to give back with our tithes and offerings.
[2217.94 --> 2221.24]  Today's offerings are for our church budget and Calvin Seminary.
[2221.24 --> 2224.80]  From 2 Corinthians 9, verse 11 and 12,
[2225.58 --> 2230.72]  You will be made rich in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion.
[2231.52 --> 2235.18]  And through us, your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God.
[2236.00 --> 2240.78]  This service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of God's people,
[2241.14 --> 2244.76]  but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God.
[2244.76 --> 2252.22]  Located in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Calvin Seminary is a learning community in the Reformed Christian tradition
[2252.22 --> 2256.88]  that forms church leaders who cultivate communities of disciples of Jesus Christ.
[2257.62 --> 2262.30]  They prepare individuals for biblically faithful and effective ministry of the word
[2262.30 --> 2266.14]  by offering Reformed theological scholarship and counsel.
[2266.88 --> 2272.02]  Since 1876, Calvin Seminary has faithfully prepared leaders
[2272.02 --> 2275.34]  who nurture disciples and serve the church.
[2276.04 --> 2281.46]  At Calvin Seminary, they strongly value the many connections with churches all over North America,
[2281.90 --> 2284.08]  including us here at Emanuel CRC.
[2284.90 --> 2288.36]  With today's financial gifts, you will be joining Calvin Seminary
[2288.36 --> 2291.74]  in preparing future leaders for the church and beyond.
[2292.62 --> 2295.86]  For those of you watching today from home,
[2296.00 --> 2300.28]  please refer to the church's website on the many different ways that you could give to today's offering.
[2300.28 --> 2303.38]  Next week's offering is for life recovery.
[2304.58 --> 2307.44]  Let us not forget how much God has blessed us.
[2307.78 --> 2310.94]  Even through this last past difficult year,
[2311.64 --> 2313.84]  let us share those blessings with others.
[2313.84 --> 2333.10]  thanks for joining us.
[2333.64 --> 2335.16]  Thanks for having me.
[2335.16 --> 2335.70]  Thanks for having me.
[2335.74 --> 2335.76]  Thanks for having me.
[2335.76 --> 2337.24]  We'd like me to give you a little bit more gentle.
[2337.24 --> 2338.64]  Perhaps50 is a little bit more time with our focus.
[2338.64 --> 2340.14]  If you're with the Бог and légers,
[2340.14 --> 2341.24]  thanks to everybody else.
[2341.24 --> 2341.98]  Have a great day.
[2341.98 --> 2342.32]  Have a great day.
[2343.84 --> 2373.82]  Thank you.
[2373.84 --> 2403.82]  Thank you.
[2403.84 --> 2433.82]  Thank you.

[2463.82 --> 2465.82]  Thank you.
[2465.82 --> 2495.82] 
[2495.82 --> 2497.82]  Thank you.
[2497.82 --> 2499.82]  Thank you.
[2499.82 --> 2501.82]  Thank you.
[2501.82 --> 2503.82]  Thank you.
[2503.82 --> 2505.82]  Thank you.
[2505.82 --> 2507.82]  Thank you.
[2507.82 --> 2509.82]  Thank you.
[2509.82 --> 2511.82]  Thank you.
[2511.82 --> 2513.82]  Thank you.
[2513.82 --> 2515.82]  Thank you.
[2515.82 --> 2517.82]  Thank you.

[2523.82 --> 2525.82]  Thank you.
[2525.82 --> 2531.82]  Thank you.
[2531.82 --> 2533.82]  Thank you.
[2533.82 --> 2535.82]  Thank you.
[2535.82 --> 2537.82]  Thank you.
[2537.82 --> 2539.82]  Thank you.

[2557.82 --> 2561.82]  help us to hear what you place on our hearts, people or situations of deep concern,

[2892.24 --> 2896.50]  Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe.
[2896.80 --> 2898.30]  We live for you.
[2906.44 --> 2911.04]  Jesus, the name above every other day.
[2911.04 --> 2918.04]  Jesus, the only one who could ever sing.
[2921.12 --> 2925.32]  Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe.
[2925.68 --> 2927.04]  We live for you.
[2928.56 --> 2930.82]  We live for you.
[2934.30 --> 2939.04]  Holy, there is no one like you.
[2939.04 --> 2942.04]  There is none beside you.
[2943.04 --> 2947.04]  Open up my eyes in wonder.
[2948.34 --> 2956.04]  Show me who you are and fill me with your heart and meaning.
[2957.34 --> 2962.04]  In your mountains and those around me.
[2962.04 --> 2968.04]  Jesus, the name above every other day.
[2971.04 --> 2975.04]  Jesus, the only one who could ever sing.
[2978.04 --> 2982.04]  Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe.
[2982.04 --> 2984.04]  We live for you.
[2984.04 --> 2985.04]  We live for you.
[2985.04 --> 2988.04]  We live for you.
[2991.04 --> 2996.04]  Holy, there is no one like you.
[2996.04 --> 2999.04]  There is none beside you.
[2999.04 --> 3000.04]  Oh, you're not mine.
[3000.04 --> 3002.04]  For you're not mine.
[3002.04 --> 3004.04]  Lord, I'll love you.
[3004.04 --> 3005.04]  I can serve you.
[3005.04 --> 3010.04]  Show me who you are and fill me with your heart and meaning.
[3010.04 --> 3013.80]  With your heart and healing
[3013.80 --> 3019.98]  Give me love to Lord, love of me
[3019.98 --> 3041.74]  I will build my life upon your love
[3041.74 --> 3047.36]  It is a heart foundation
[3047.36 --> 3055.68]  I will put my trust in you alone
[3055.68 --> 3061.24]  And I will not be shaken
[3061.24 --> 3069.34]  I will build my life upon your love
[3069.34 --> 3074.92]  It is a heart foundation
[3074.92 --> 3088.52]  I will not be shaken
[3088.52 --> 3094.10]  Only there is no love like you
[3094.10 --> 3096.84]  There is none desire
[3096.84 --> 3102.26]  I will open up my eyes in thunder
[3102.26 --> 3106.06]  And show me who you are
[3106.06 --> 3110.74]  And fill me with your heart and healing
[3110.74 --> 3116.32]  In your love to Lord, love of me
[3116.32 --> 3121.48]  Holy, there is no one like you
[3121.48 --> 3125.04]  There is none beside you
[3125.04 --> 3130.06]  Open up my eyes in wonder
[3130.06 --> 3134.04]  And show me who you are
[3134.04 --> 3137.64]  And fill me with your heart
[3137.64 --> 3141.22]  And lead me in your love
[3141.22 --> 3145.96]  To those around me
[3145.96 --> 3157.24]  And fill me with your heart
[3157.32 --> 3159.34]  And fill me with your heart
[3159.34 --> 3159.94]  And fill me with your heart
[3160.12 --> 3161.86]  You've been praying i'll open for you
[3161.86 --> 3162.16]  In my faith
[3162.16 --> 3163.20]  You've been praying i'll open for you
[3163.20 --> 3165.04]  And hear about you
[3165.04 --> 3167.20]  Have I mentioned yet how I'm excited?
[3167.20 --> 3176.52]  Have I mentioned yet how I'm excited to be here?
[3180.84 --> 3186.04]  So, ordinarily, at this point in the service, I would come up here and I would say, grab
[3186.04 --> 3188.90]  your Bibles, open them up too, and we're going to read.
[3190.26 --> 3194.64]  Now, I still want you to grab your Bibles, but I want you to wait for that open them
[3194.64 --> 3195.66]  up to section.
[3197.20 --> 3203.94]  So, we are beginning a summer series here that we have called Ask Anything.
[3205.12 --> 3208.94]  And for this series, we asked you guys to submit questions.
[3209.38 --> 3214.32]  And then over the course of the summer, we will answer your questions and address the
[3214.32 --> 3218.72]  things that you have asked and wanted us to wonder about together.
[3219.68 --> 3224.44]  In due course, as you can imagine, this last week has been a little bit of chaos around
[3224.44 --> 3225.74]  here as we try to figure things out.
[3225.74 --> 3230.80]  But in due course, we will publish the list of questions and when they will be addressed
[3230.80 --> 3235.32]  so that you can find your question or you can find the ones that particularly interest you
[3235.32 --> 3240.78]  and you can make a point of participating in that service, either by being here or by watching
[3240.78 --> 3241.28]  online.
[3242.90 --> 3248.60]  Now, I really believe in the importance of asking questions.
[3248.60 --> 3253.98]  I really believe the church needs to be the kind of place and the kind of community where
[3253.98 --> 3259.64]  we can ask hard questions and we can wrestle with difficult answers.
[3259.64 --> 3269.00]  I'm also aware, and all sorts of studies have borne this out, that the church has a bit of a
[3269.00 --> 3276.44]  reputation for being the kind of place that stymies questions or the kind of place where it's unsafe
[3276.44 --> 3281.24]  to ask hard questions or to wonder aloud about certain things.
[3281.24 --> 3286.10]  I just want to say, as a matter of principle, not here.
[3287.38 --> 3288.30]  Not with me.
[3289.00 --> 3290.40]  Not in this community.
[3291.40 --> 3296.20]  We will be the place where hard questions can be asked, where things can be wrestled through,
[3296.20 --> 3301.20]  and we will be the kind of community that presses in to the trials and tribulations of those
[3301.20 --> 3306.24]  questions and those uncomfortable places where the answers might find us.
[3306.24 --> 3311.84]  But to do that, I want to make a quick distinction here by way of introduction and talk about
[3311.84 --> 3315.40]  the difference between skepticism and cynicism.
[3316.80 --> 3317.80]  Skepticism is good.
[3318.22 --> 3321.00]  Skepticism is the means by which you ask good questions.
[3321.00 --> 3322.16]  You wonder things.
[3322.30 --> 3323.08]  You challenge things.
[3323.20 --> 3325.16]  You dig deep into something, right?
[3325.18 --> 3328.50]  We only learn new things by asking about things we don't know.
[3328.72 --> 3329.60]  That's skepticism.
[3329.60 --> 3338.58]  Cynicism stops the asking of questions, presumes a particular meaning, usually not a fair one,
[3338.92 --> 3343.72]  and presumes that we will always be stuck in thinking that way or being that way or acting
[3343.72 --> 3344.26]  that way.
[3344.26 --> 3349.62]  And it doesn't help us move together as a community.
[3350.80 --> 3356.16]  And so I want us to practice good skepticism and guard ourselves against cynicism.
[3356.16 --> 3359.06]  Similarly, doubt.
[3359.38 --> 3360.24]  Doubt is good.
[3360.58 --> 3364.76]  If we didn't have doubts, we would never get answers because answers come after questions.
[3365.00 --> 3366.96]  And without doubt, there are no questions.
[3368.18 --> 3371.52]  Doubt is good and normal.
[3372.24 --> 3377.60]  And so as a Christian person, if you've ever felt doubt and wondered, oh, I don't know about
[3377.60 --> 3380.80]  this or I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do because I'm doubting and I don't know where
[3380.80 --> 3382.92]  to go with that, doubt is good.
[3383.06 --> 3386.64]  And so please don't experience doubt alone.
[3387.82 --> 3390.24]  Come to someone and ask the question.
[3391.16 --> 3391.88]  Find an answer.
[3393.24 --> 3396.44]  But there's a difference, of course, between doubt and denial.
[3398.02 --> 3399.16]  Doubt is good.
[3399.90 --> 3401.68]  Denial already presumes a conclusion.
[3402.74 --> 3404.60]  But you haven't wrestled to get there yet.
[3405.14 --> 3406.86]  So don't jump to denial.
[3406.86 --> 3412.18]  Well, start with doubt, start with introspection, start with good questions.
[3412.96 --> 3418.48]  If I can rip a little bit on a phrase, Miss Frizzle from Magic School Bus likes to say,
[3418.90 --> 3422.08]  ask questions, make mistakes, and get messy.
[3423.24 --> 3424.68]  We're going to do that this summer.
[3425.90 --> 3429.70]  Now, some of the answers that we give are going to be sort of biblical studies.
[3430.16 --> 3433.20]  Some of the answers that we give are going to wrestle with Christian theology.
[3433.46 --> 3436.00]  Some of it is going to be philosophy and worldview.
[3436.00 --> 3438.32]  Some of it is going to be ethics and morality.
[3438.58 --> 3443.42]  Some of it is going to be apologetics, which is just a fancy word for defending the Christian faith.
[3444.40 --> 3448.42]  And some of our conversations will touch on every one of these categories together.
[3449.20 --> 3455.96]  Now, what that means is some of you are going to enjoy certain answers more than other answers.
[3456.76 --> 3458.08]  And that's also okay.
[3458.56 --> 3464.50]  We are a diverse community with a diversity of preferences and ways of learning and engagement
[3464.50 --> 3465.06]  and the like.
[3465.06 --> 3471.18]  And so we're going to endure together on those things that are our least or less favorite
[3471.18 --> 3477.42]  for the sake of our brothers and sisters who are really into this particular question or thing.
[3478.30 --> 3481.96]  I also want to say at the outset, and this is not a caveat but a reality,
[3482.30 --> 3487.46]  that some of our questions for this summer have clear and definitive answers.
[3487.46 --> 3494.76]  Others of them are more debatable and well-meaning Christians can contest them and hold different ideas.
[3495.70 --> 3498.66]  And so sometimes we're going to say things like, the Bible says.
[3499.54 --> 3502.86]  Other times we'll say things like, we believe the Bible says.
[3502.86 --> 3510.10]  And then sometimes we will say, or I will say, or whoever's up here leading, I believe the Bible says.
[3511.14 --> 3514.12]  In some cases we'll hear personal testimony and experience.
[3514.58 --> 3521.34]  And in some cases, or in every case, I will challenge you to think for yourselves and to continue that conversation.
[3522.20 --> 3528.30]  In fact, I hope each week as we gather that you'll walk out of this series that you'll be asking more questions
[3528.30 --> 3531.96]  and harder questions and you'll start wrestling with them in community together.
[3533.82 --> 3535.72]  It's a value statement for us all.
[3536.24 --> 3538.52]  Ask anything and ask anywhere.
[3539.52 --> 3542.88]  What we start in here, I pray that you take out there.
[3545.26 --> 3547.84]  And so our first question.
[3548.84 --> 3554.92]  Our first question in this series actually comes from a quote which the internet attributes to Pascal.
[3554.92 --> 3561.64]  Now, Blaise Pascal is a French mathematician and physicist and inventor and philosopher from the 17th century.
[3562.76 --> 3567.80]  And the quote that you will find if you go online and Google it is the following.
[3568.94 --> 3574.70]  There is a God-shaped vacuum in the heart of each man which cannot be satisfied by any created thing,
[3575.40 --> 3580.12]  but only by God the creator, made known through Jesus Christ.
[3580.12 --> 3585.08]  Now, the question that was submitted to us is as follows.
[3585.26 --> 3588.58]  Is there a God-sized vacuum in the heart of every person?
[3589.78 --> 3590.52]  The questioner added,
[3590.90 --> 3595.24]  I recently heard that this idea is a myth because people have completely shut out God.
[3595.62 --> 3598.04]  Is there a vacuum and does it matter?
[3600.44 --> 3602.68]  And so, there's our question.
[3603.36 --> 3604.14]  There's our roadmap.
[3604.14 --> 3612.36]  Now, on closer inspection, the actual quote is more of a paraphrase,
[3612.78 --> 3615.14]  and it's an idea that's not unique to Pascal.
[3615.94 --> 3620.18]  But, like I said, if you Google it, the top search results will say that it's from Pascal,
[3620.52 --> 3625.46]  and many notable and very intelligent people have quoted it as such.
[3625.52 --> 3632.36]  In fact, not notable nor necessarily intelligent, but I've quoted it as such, being from Pascal.
[3632.36 --> 3639.10]  But, if that's what you say, the internet has led you astray, because it's not.
[3639.94 --> 3643.68]  Now, unlike Pastor Kevin's adage, which is that the internet always tells you the truth,
[3644.20 --> 3646.48]  in this case, that's not true.
[3647.38 --> 3648.54]  It is a paraphrase.
[3648.62 --> 3653.10]  And so, actually, what Pascal did say, and it's a little bit longer of a quote,
[3653.22 --> 3655.40]  which is why it's not memeable in the same way,
[3655.48 --> 3657.16]  but what he did say is this.
[3657.16 --> 3663.50]  What else does this craving and this helplessness proclaim,
[3664.34 --> 3667.48]  but that there was once in man a true happiness,
[3667.80 --> 3672.20]  of which all that now remains is the empty print and trace.
[3673.08 --> 3676.18]  This he tries in vain to fill with everything around him,
[3676.52 --> 3680.64]  seeking in things that are not there the help he cannot find in those that are,
[3680.64 --> 3687.32]  though none can help, since this infinite abyss can be filled with only an infinite and immutable object,
[3687.66 --> 3689.78]  in other words, by God himself.
[3691.28 --> 3696.94]  So, the actual quotes, the God-shaped vacuum is called an infinite abyss.
[3697.76 --> 3700.32]  Now, like I said, this quote is a little bit wordy,
[3700.42 --> 3702.06]  and you probably couldn't turn it into a good meme,
[3702.14 --> 3704.16]  but I actually think when you dig deeper into it,
[3704.20 --> 3706.52]  it's a more beautiful quote,
[3706.58 --> 3708.82]  and it presents a more beautiful reality.
[3708.82 --> 3717.92]  And like I said, it picks up on a concept or an idea that other Christian writers have touched on before.
[3718.86 --> 3720.32]  In the fourth century,
[3721.40 --> 3722.94]  Augustine, church father,
[3723.78 --> 3724.34]  he says,
[3724.70 --> 3726.78]  You have made us for yourself, O Lord,
[3726.98 --> 3730.58]  and our hearts are restless until they rest in you.
[3731.60 --> 3732.20]  And then all the way,
[3732.44 --> 3733.52]  in the 20th century,
[3733.66 --> 3734.92]  C.S. Lewis said,
[3734.92 --> 3740.08]  If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy,
[3740.40 --> 3745.22]  the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world.
[3746.96 --> 3751.24]  Now, at root, this question is a question of anthropology.
[3752.60 --> 3755.78]  Anthropology is a study of what makes a person a person.
[3756.48 --> 3758.44]  And so, as Christians trying to answer this question,
[3758.84 --> 3760.12]  we're going to start at the beginning.
[3760.24 --> 3761.76]  We're going to start in Genesis.
[3761.76 --> 3764.50]  And so, since you have your Bibles at the ready,
[3766.26 --> 3767.58]  three people moved.
[3767.70 --> 3767.86]  Good.
[3769.08 --> 3771.44]  Genesis 1, 27.
[3771.72 --> 3772.70]  It will be on the screen,
[3772.96 --> 3774.58]  so you do have a bit of an excuse.
[3776.68 --> 3779.48]  So God created mankind in his own image.
[3779.88 --> 3781.90]  In the image of God, he created them.
[3782.08 --> 3784.90]  Male and female, he created them.
[3784.90 --> 3791.58]  People are created in the image of God.
[3792.66 --> 3795.48]  And that means that there is something of God
[3795.48 --> 3800.16]  and God's character and being in us at creation.
[3801.34 --> 3805.28]  In fact, if you take that story forward from Genesis 1 into Genesis 3,
[3805.62 --> 3808.52]  it's that very idea that the serpent, right,
[3808.56 --> 3813.30]  which is the reality present there of the devil, right,
[3813.30 --> 3816.26]  that the serpent manipulates in Genesis 3,
[3816.48 --> 3819.72]  the story of the rebellion and the fall of humanity
[3819.72 --> 3821.66]  out of relationship with God.
[3821.74 --> 3824.76]  The serpent says to Eve and then Eve to Adam,
[3824.92 --> 3828.32]  did God really say you must not eat from any tree in the garden?
[3828.64 --> 3830.34]  You will not certainly die,
[3830.62 --> 3832.84]  for God knows that when you eat from it,
[3832.98 --> 3836.68]  your eyes will be opened and you will be like God,
[3837.20 --> 3838.80]  knowing good and evil.
[3838.80 --> 3841.10]  What Adam and Eve seem to have already forgotten
[3841.10 --> 3844.48]  is that they are already like God
[3844.48 --> 3846.88]  because they're created in his image.
[3848.00 --> 3850.88]  The deeper truth of this story is that they wanted more.
[3850.98 --> 3852.10]  They wanted something else.
[3852.18 --> 3852.80]  They wanted something other.
[3853.50 --> 3855.84]  They were deceived and they deceived themselves
[3855.84 --> 3857.34]  that there was another way,
[3857.44 --> 3860.02]  that they believed that they had a better way.
[3861.44 --> 3864.98]  They believed that there was a way other than God's own goodness.
[3864.98 --> 3868.84]  And so in disobedience and rebellion,
[3869.04 --> 3871.04]  they fell out of relationship with God,
[3871.42 --> 3872.84]  but, and this is really important,
[3873.30 --> 3876.48]  not out of his image.
[3877.86 --> 3879.46]  In fact, in Genesis 9,
[3879.82 --> 3882.52]  after the flood and the covenant that God makes with Noah,
[3882.96 --> 3887.48]  God affirms to Noah that people are still his image bearers, right?
[3887.58 --> 3890.38]  And it's the being image bearers of God
[3890.38 --> 3893.38]  that is the source of our worth and our dignity
[3893.38 --> 3896.74]  and our honor as humans in the world.
[3897.64 --> 3900.94]  And now we can add to that idea.
[3902.22 --> 3904.62]  Ecclesiastes 3, verse 11.
[3904.76 --> 3907.02]  And I think this verse is critical for our understanding
[3907.02 --> 3910.06]  of the God-shaped vacuum that we're talking about.
[3910.84 --> 3913.86]  The author of Ecclesiastes, the teacher says,
[3913.86 --> 3917.78]  he has made everything beautiful in its time
[3917.78 --> 3923.04]  and he has also set eternity in the human heart.
[3924.14 --> 3927.24]  He has set eternity in the human heart.
[3927.32 --> 3929.64]  And I take that to mean that there is a longing,
[3929.92 --> 3932.10]  there is an aching for something more,
[3932.20 --> 3932.94]  for something transcended,
[3933.56 --> 3935.98]  for something eternal that is outside of time
[3935.98 --> 3937.46]  and the ages of history.
[3939.52 --> 3941.96]  In fact, let me illustrate this point.
[3942.02 --> 3944.82]  I'm going to jump to psychology and sociology for a minute.
[3945.30 --> 3952.06]  This is an idea that was affirmed in the work of one Abraham Maslow.
[3952.56 --> 3954.18]  Now, don't worry, we will come back to the Bible,
[3954.30 --> 3956.58]  but I believe that when the Bible is right about something,
[3956.70 --> 3958.44]  psychology and sociology will affirm it
[3958.44 --> 3960.42]  and we will see that work its way out.
[3960.86 --> 3962.90]  But we will come back to the Bible because it is the rule.
[3962.90 --> 3967.86]  But in the 1940s, Maslow's hierarchy of needs
[3967.86 --> 3975.96]  was published and became the sort of rule for understanding human nature.
[3976.72 --> 3979.66]  In fact, when I was in university in the early 2000s,
[3979.70 --> 3982.86]  we were still studying that in my Psych 101 class.
[3984.24 --> 3987.66]  Maslow said that humans have five basic needs.
[3987.66 --> 3989.12]  We have physiological needs.
[3989.22 --> 3991.14]  That's things like breath and food and water.
[3991.34 --> 3992.66]  We have safety needs.
[3992.76 --> 3994.22]  That's security and shelter.
[3994.48 --> 3996.32]  We have a need for love and belonging,
[3996.50 --> 3998.30]  which is probably self-explanatory to you.
[3998.84 --> 4002.40]  We have a need for personal and self-esteem.
[4002.78 --> 4006.04]  That's confidence and respect and a feeling of worthiness.
[4006.94 --> 4012.46]  And the top hierarchy of needs is what he called self-actualization.
[4013.36 --> 4015.04]  Maslow said in 1943,
[4015.04 --> 4018.22]  what a man can be, he must be.
[4019.12 --> 4021.44]  And all of our needs are then expressed in some way
[4021.44 --> 4023.84]  as a working out of these basic five.
[4025.10 --> 4027.16]  Now, what people don't realize,
[4028.14 --> 4031.40]  and I wasn't taught this in Psych 101 either,
[4031.84 --> 4035.02]  but in 1971, Maslow amended his theory.
[4036.16 --> 4038.20]  He published something called
[4038.20 --> 4039.86]  The Further Reaches of Human Nature,
[4039.86 --> 4043.92]  in which he noted that the original study participants
[4043.92 --> 4048.52]  were not satisfied with their own accomplishments and experience.
[4048.62 --> 4051.00]  In short, he noted that those who were,
[4051.14 --> 4053.62]  by all assessment and account, self-actualized,
[4053.70 --> 4056.82]  who had sort of hit that fifth stage of human need,
[4057.52 --> 4059.18]  didn't feel fulfilled.
[4060.46 --> 4063.70]  And he found that they were looking beyond themselves
[4063.70 --> 4065.90]  to try and find the fulfillment
[4065.90 --> 4067.34]  that they had been looking for the whole time.
[4067.34 --> 4070.80]  Now, Maslow came to call this need,
[4070.96 --> 4074.82]  the need for an experience of transcendence.
[4076.08 --> 4077.16]  Now, he wrote,
[4077.16 --> 4098.26]  So for generations, right,
[4098.26 --> 4101.48]  it was assumed that the ultimate human experience
[4101.48 --> 4104.64]  or the ultimate experience of being human was internal.
[4104.84 --> 4107.32]  It was self-centered in self-actualization.
[4107.88 --> 4109.00]  But that wasn't enough.
[4109.20 --> 4112.50]  Maslow came to recognize what Augustine and Paul
[4112.50 --> 4114.08]  and the teacher in Ecclesiastes
[4114.08 --> 4117.40]  and the author of Genesis have long attested to,
[4117.60 --> 4120.64]  that we were created for an experience of transcendence,
[4120.74 --> 4121.66]  or in our terms,
[4121.66 --> 4123.86]  we were created for the divine,
[4124.22 --> 4128.44]  and we are restless until we find ourselves in him,
[4129.14 --> 4131.26]  until we are found by him.
[4132.22 --> 4134.42]  And I think you can probably call that
[4134.42 --> 4136.62]  the God-shaped vacuum.
[4139.74 --> 4140.98]  But there's a problem.
[4142.88 --> 4145.74]  Let's look at Ecclesiastes 3, 11 one more time.
[4147.34 --> 4150.40]  He has also set eternity in every human heart,
[4150.40 --> 4155.32]  yet no one can fathom what God has done
[4155.32 --> 4157.56]  from beginning to end.
[4158.44 --> 4160.34]  And so there's a longing there,
[4160.94 --> 4162.82]  but we can't fathom it.
[4163.36 --> 4164.38]  We can't make sense of it.
[4164.40 --> 4166.74]  We can't make heads or tails of it.
[4167.24 --> 4169.98]  The longing itself isn't enough.
[4170.16 --> 4172.12]  There's still something missing.
[4172.96 --> 4174.46]  And again, and I think you can see this
[4174.46 --> 4176.82]  in what Paul writes in Romans 1.
[4176.94 --> 4178.26]  And so we're going to jump to Romans 1.
[4178.26 --> 4182.38]  Paul says, Romans 1 starting at verse 18,
[4182.38 --> 4194.38]  Right?
[4194.38 --> 4195.72]  God has made it plain to them.
[4195.98 --> 4197.62]  For since the creation of the world,
[4197.76 --> 4199.26]  God's invisible qualities,
[4199.46 --> 4201.30]  his eternal power and divine nature,
[4201.30 --> 4203.16]  have been clearly seen,
[4203.26 --> 4204.90]  being understood from what has been made,
[4205.16 --> 4206.90]  so that people are without excuse.
[4207.72 --> 4207.90]  Right?
[4207.94 --> 4209.32]  There is something about God
[4209.32 --> 4211.04]  that can be known and perceived
[4211.04 --> 4212.36]  in the world around us.
[4212.42 --> 4214.36]  And that perception is intended
[4214.36 --> 4216.66]  to drive us towards God.
[4216.88 --> 4218.12]  But notice what Paul said,
[4218.12 --> 4220.46]  that people suppress the truth
[4220.46 --> 4221.80]  by their wickedness.
[4222.72 --> 4224.30]  That's what sin does.
[4225.10 --> 4228.18]  It suppresses the truth of God in you.
[4230.24 --> 4231.30]  To my mind,
[4232.16 --> 4234.10]  few people have been able to communicate
[4234.10 --> 4237.50]  this tensioned reality
[4237.50 --> 4239.88]  as well as John Calvin.
[4240.60 --> 4242.92]  John Calvin is a 16th century
[4242.92 --> 4244.66]  French Christian and reformer.
[4244.66 --> 4247.98]  And he begins his massive book,
[4248.16 --> 4249.68]  The Institutes of the Christian Religion,
[4250.14 --> 4250.82]  by saying,
[4252.02 --> 4254.34]  Our wisdom consists almost entirely
[4254.34 --> 4255.14]  of two parts,
[4255.56 --> 4257.18]  the knowledge of God and of ourselves.
[4258.12 --> 4259.02]  In the first place,
[4259.32 --> 4261.04]  no person can survey themselves
[4261.04 --> 4262.92]  without forthwith turning their thoughts
[4262.92 --> 4265.62]  toward the God in whom he lives and moves.
[4266.26 --> 4267.60]  In the second place,
[4268.06 --> 4270.18]  those blessings which unceasingly
[4270.18 --> 4271.56]  distill to us from heaven
[4271.56 --> 4274.06]  are like streams conducting us
[4274.06 --> 4275.42]  to the fountain.
[4276.10 --> 4277.16]  He draws out from that
[4277.16 --> 4277.64]  and he says,
[4278.36 --> 4279.34]  Every person, therefore,
[4279.54 --> 4281.24]  on coming to a knowledge of himself
[4281.24 --> 4283.58]  is not only to seek God,
[4283.80 --> 4287.12]  but is also led as by the hand to him.
[4288.62 --> 4289.80]  Now you might call that
[4289.80 --> 4291.42]  the God-shaped vacuum.
[4291.84 --> 4293.44]  But then Calvin goes on
[4293.44 --> 4295.10]  and he recognizes something deeper
[4295.10 --> 4296.46]  about human nature
[4296.46 --> 4298.42]  after our rebellion against God
[4298.42 --> 4299.26]  and because of sin.
[4299.60 --> 4302.02]  As Jeremiah 17.9 says,
[4302.02 --> 4304.30]  The heart is deceitful above all else
[4304.30 --> 4305.58]  and beyond cure.
[4305.80 --> 4307.02]  Calvin then writes,
[4307.50 --> 4310.94]  So long as we do not look beyond the earth,
[4311.46 --> 4312.60]  we are quite pleased
[4312.60 --> 4314.20]  with our own righteousness
[4314.20 --> 4315.54]  and wisdom and virtue.
[4315.96 --> 4317.00]  We address ourselves
[4317.00 --> 4318.96]  in the most flattering of terms
[4318.96 --> 4321.58]  and seem only less than demigods
[4321.58 --> 4323.90]  to ourselves, I would add.
[4325.48 --> 4326.80]  Calvin's point here
[4326.80 --> 4329.56]  is that unless we look to God
[4329.56 --> 4330.46]  for comparison,
[4330.94 --> 4331.58]  we will never,
[4332.00 --> 4332.80]  on our own,
[4333.10 --> 4334.06]  feel the need
[4334.06 --> 4335.42]  or the vacuum
[4335.42 --> 4337.44]  of God's absence.
[4338.16 --> 4340.04]  We are perfectly content
[4340.04 --> 4341.90]  with what's down here
[4341.90 --> 4343.40]  if only because
[4343.40 --> 4344.54]  we make so much
[4344.54 --> 4345.56]  of what's down here.
[4346.22 --> 4346.42]  Right?
[4346.46 --> 4347.20]  We make so much
[4347.20 --> 4347.86]  of ourselves.
[4348.52 --> 4349.56]  We make ourselves
[4349.56 --> 4350.62]  and our own experiences
[4350.62 --> 4351.16]  and lives
[4351.16 --> 4352.58]  into our own idols
[4352.58 --> 4353.36]  and we simply
[4353.36 --> 4354.76]  don't know any better
[4354.76 --> 4356.90]  to feel the lack
[4356.90 --> 4358.14]  or the absence
[4358.14 --> 4359.00]  of God.
[4360.38 --> 4361.56]  Calvin uses this illustration.
[4361.76 --> 4362.72]  I'm going to borrow it from him.
[4363.46 --> 4363.80]  He says,
[4364.16 --> 4365.46]  In the middle of the day
[4365.46 --> 4367.44]  when we look around us
[4367.44 --> 4368.76]  at the ground
[4368.76 --> 4369.76]  to see the things
[4369.76 --> 4370.54]  that we can see
[4370.54 --> 4371.52]  here or there
[4371.52 --> 4372.54]  or wherever it is,
[4373.30 --> 4373.42]  right,
[4373.44 --> 4374.24]  it's easy to think
[4374.24 --> 4376.04]  that we have a really strong sense
[4376.04 --> 4377.02]  of what is clear
[4377.02 --> 4378.08]  and what is there.
[4378.34 --> 4378.54]  Right?
[4378.58 --> 4379.56]  We can see it.
[4379.56 --> 4381.62]  We have a penetrating eyesight,
[4381.90 --> 4382.34]  he says,
[4382.46 --> 4383.38]  into the world.
[4384.16 --> 4385.34]  But if you look up
[4385.34 --> 4386.06]  to the sun
[4386.06 --> 4387.84]  and stare at the sun
[4387.84 --> 4388.40]  for a little while,
[4388.46 --> 4389.22]  no, don't do that.
[4390.86 --> 4391.06]  Right?
[4391.08 --> 4392.02]  If you look at the sun
[4392.02 --> 4393.40]  unveiled and directly,
[4394.04 --> 4394.56]  Calvin says,
[4394.68 --> 4395.64]  we are dazzled
[4395.64 --> 4396.46]  and confounded.
[4397.42 --> 4397.58]  Right?
[4397.58 --> 4398.84]  You can't see anything
[4398.84 --> 4399.88]  by comparison.
[4401.84 --> 4402.90]  And what Calvin calls this
[4402.90 --> 4403.56]  is the delusion
[4404.38 --> 4405.26]  of estimating
[4405.26 --> 4406.64]  the powers of our mind.
[4407.52 --> 4408.32]  The idea is that
[4408.32 --> 4409.64]  without comparison
[4409.64 --> 4410.36]  to God,
[4410.46 --> 4411.26]  we would never know
[4411.26 --> 4412.54]  of our need for God
[4412.54 --> 4414.50]  or on our own,
[4414.64 --> 4415.70]  it's out of our reach
[4415.70 --> 4416.84]  and beyond our capacity.
[4417.98 --> 4418.06]  Right?
[4418.08 --> 4418.70]  This means that
[4418.70 --> 4420.30]  even when we recognize
[4420.30 --> 4422.28]  that there is a God-sized hole
[4422.28 --> 4423.48]  missing from those
[4423.48 --> 4424.50]  who don't believe,
[4424.74 --> 4426.06]  for those who don't believe,
[4426.80 --> 4427.74]  that doesn't really matter.
[4428.86 --> 4429.38]  Right?
[4429.42 --> 4429.86]  They are,
[4430.02 --> 4431.36]  to continue Calvin's illustration,
[4431.78 --> 4432.48]  blind to it.
[4433.92 --> 4434.66]  And so,
[4434.86 --> 4435.52]  the question asks,
[4435.66 --> 4437.00]  is there a God-sized hole
[4437.00 --> 4438.28]  in the hearts of people?
[4438.68 --> 4439.20]  There is.
[4439.82 --> 4440.70]  You were created
[4440.70 --> 4441.66]  for God
[4441.66 --> 4443.22]  and to be with God
[4443.22 --> 4444.70]  in relationship to God.
[4444.78 --> 4445.44]  You are created
[4445.44 --> 4446.38]  in his image
[4446.38 --> 4447.66]  and with eternity
[4447.66 --> 4449.00]  in your heart.
[4449.14 --> 4450.82]  But until you know God,
[4450.92 --> 4451.72]  the reality is
[4451.72 --> 4452.66]  you'll never know
[4452.66 --> 4453.34]  what you're missing.
[4455.64 --> 4456.68]  We don't know
[4456.68 --> 4457.54]  what we don't know.
[4458.32 --> 4459.76]  And what you don't know
[4459.76 --> 4461.02]  that you don't know,
[4461.10 --> 4461.88]  you can't know
[4461.88 --> 4462.76]  that you need to know.
[4462.76 --> 4464.90]  We follow that?
[4466.14 --> 4466.50]  Right?
[4466.54 --> 4466.96]  We don't know
[4466.96 --> 4467.64]  what we don't know.
[4468.66 --> 4469.92]  That's self-evident, right?
[4470.12 --> 4471.10]  But what you don't know
[4471.10 --> 4471.82]  that you don't know,
[4471.88 --> 4473.04]  you then can't know
[4473.04 --> 4474.30]  that you need to know.
[4474.74 --> 4475.80]  If you need to hear that again,
[4476.46 --> 4477.16]  go to the live stream
[4477.16 --> 4477.58]  after church.
[4479.64 --> 4480.42]  Point is,
[4481.54 --> 4482.84]  until God does something,
[4483.48 --> 4484.42]  we'll never know
[4484.42 --> 4485.28]  that there's a hole
[4485.28 --> 4486.72]  that only God can fill.
[4488.66 --> 4489.76]  And that's the last part
[4489.76 --> 4490.86]  of the question, right?
[4491.42 --> 4492.16]  Does it matter?
[4493.62 --> 4494.14]  Because
[4494.14 --> 4496.32]  it matters.
[4497.70 --> 4499.14]  It matters so much.
[4499.20 --> 4500.48]  And maybe not for the reason
[4500.48 --> 4501.36]  that you might have
[4501.36 --> 4502.08]  ordinarily thought
[4502.08 --> 4502.74]  and definitely not
[4502.74 --> 4503.24]  for the reason
[4503.24 --> 4504.38]  that people usually quote
[4504.38 --> 4505.92]  Pascal in that moment,
[4506.26 --> 4506.42]  right?
[4506.48 --> 4507.62]  People have misquoted
[4507.62 --> 4509.06]  Pascal in that moment
[4509.06 --> 4509.54]  because you see,
[4509.76 --> 4510.66]  this isn't actually
[4510.66 --> 4511.96]  about apologetics.
[4513.20 --> 4513.38]  Right?
[4513.38 --> 4514.36]  You aren't going to
[4514.36 --> 4515.66]  convince someone
[4515.66 --> 4516.72]  who doesn't know
[4516.72 --> 4517.54]  God in Jesus
[4517.54 --> 4518.62]  that the thing
[4518.62 --> 4519.32]  that they are missing
[4519.32 --> 4519.94]  in their life
[4519.94 --> 4520.88]  really is a person.
[4520.88 --> 4523.02]  Right?
[4523.02 --> 4523.42]  That's the way
[4523.42 --> 4524.12]  people normally
[4524.12 --> 4525.10]  think about this quote
[4525.10 --> 4526.42]  or use this idea.
[4526.42 --> 4527.50]  But you cannot
[4527.50 --> 4528.42]  rationally,
[4528.78 --> 4529.52]  didactically,
[4529.70 --> 4530.54]  propositionally
[4530.54 --> 4531.42]  argue someone
[4531.42 --> 4532.62]  into Christian belief.
[4532.94 --> 4533.30]  Trust me,
[4533.34 --> 4533.76]  I've tried.
[4533.76 --> 4535.68]  Now,
[4535.82 --> 4536.70]  don't hear what I'm not
[4536.70 --> 4537.50]  saying, right?
[4537.68 --> 4538.62]  The Christian faith
[4538.62 --> 4539.28]  is rational,
[4539.62 --> 4540.30]  the Christian faith
[4540.30 --> 4541.66]  is full of propositional
[4541.66 --> 4542.12]  truths,
[4542.32 --> 4543.60]  and there are more
[4543.60 --> 4544.60]  answers in the Bible,
[4544.72 --> 4545.12]  I believe,
[4545.18 --> 4545.74]  than in any other
[4545.74 --> 4546.12]  worldview.
[4546.12 --> 4548.64]  But you're still
[4548.64 --> 4549.62]  not going to convince
[4549.62 --> 4550.84]  someone that what
[4550.84 --> 4551.58]  they're really hungry
[4551.58 --> 4552.94]  for is Jesus.
[4554.40 --> 4554.58]  Right?
[4554.64 --> 4555.26]  Their eyes,
[4555.76 --> 4556.54]  or the eyes of their
[4556.54 --> 4556.92]  heart,
[4557.28 --> 4558.52]  are simply blind
[4558.52 --> 4559.02]  to it.
[4560.58 --> 4561.82]  That's depravity.
[4562.46 --> 4563.94]  That's being dead
[4563.94 --> 4564.86]  in our sin,
[4565.08 --> 4566.20]  as the Bible says
[4566.20 --> 4566.60]  we are,
[4566.66 --> 4567.96]  apart from God's
[4567.96 --> 4568.70]  grace.
[4569.66 --> 4570.38]  And actually,
[4570.54 --> 4571.44]  this realization
[4571.44 --> 4572.48]  now is freedom
[4572.48 --> 4573.72]  for you and me.
[4574.18 --> 4574.32]  Right?
[4574.32 --> 4574.88]  Because that means
[4574.88 --> 4576.56]  in our shared mission
[4576.56 --> 4577.02]  with God,
[4577.06 --> 4578.02]  as he sends us out
[4578.02 --> 4578.64]  to the world,
[4578.88 --> 4579.04]  right,
[4579.04 --> 4579.86]  it's not about you
[4579.86 --> 4581.00]  having the right arguments,
[4581.36 --> 4582.16]  it's not ultimately
[4582.16 --> 4583.06]  about you knowing
[4583.06 --> 4584.32]  the right things to say,
[4584.36 --> 4585.34]  it's about God
[4585.34 --> 4586.54]  who uses you
[4586.54 --> 4587.62]  as a vehicle
[4587.62 --> 4588.62]  of his revelation,
[4588.90 --> 4589.86]  who uses you
[4589.86 --> 4590.56]  as a means
[4590.56 --> 4591.78]  of his grace.
[4592.06 --> 4592.14]  Right?
[4592.22 --> 4593.04]  God's mission
[4593.04 --> 4594.54]  to reach the world
[4594.54 --> 4595.36]  isn't dependent
[4595.36 --> 4596.44]  upon you,
[4597.44 --> 4599.04]  but he uses you
[4599.04 --> 4601.02]  to grow his church
[4601.02 --> 4602.50]  and to reveal
[4602.50 --> 4602.96]  his kingdom.
[4602.96 --> 4603.02]  freedom.
[4604.14 --> 4605.12]  And that is freedom
[4605.12 --> 4606.20]  for those of us
[4606.20 --> 4607.10]  who long to be
[4607.10 --> 4608.78]  faithful to God.
[4611.02 --> 4611.54]  And,
[4611.86 --> 4612.14]  now,
[4612.74 --> 4613.60]  if you are
[4613.60 --> 4614.68]  a believer,
[4614.92 --> 4615.64]  if you are
[4615.64 --> 4617.08]  a new creation,
[4617.52 --> 4619.14]  if you have received
[4619.14 --> 4620.28]  the Spirit of God,
[4620.40 --> 4621.46]  then this truth
[4621.46 --> 4622.68]  about the infinite
[4622.68 --> 4623.74]  abyss of your heart
[4623.74 --> 4624.78]  really actually
[4624.78 --> 4626.16]  starts to make sense
[4626.16 --> 4627.44]  of your life now.
[4627.84 --> 4628.04]  Right?
[4628.10 --> 4629.10]  Your ongoing struggles
[4629.10 --> 4629.84]  with sin
[4629.84 --> 4630.66]  and your struggles
[4630.66 --> 4631.32]  with belief
[4631.32 --> 4632.70]  and with unbelief.
[4633.64 --> 4634.34]  But the reality here
[4634.34 --> 4635.02]  is that you will
[4635.02 --> 4636.00]  never convince
[4636.00 --> 4636.94]  the unbeliever
[4636.94 --> 4637.72]  of this truth,
[4637.86 --> 4638.82]  but you will
[4638.82 --> 4640.46]  convict the believer
[4640.46 --> 4642.38]  with this truth.
[4642.38 --> 4646.26]  in his book,
[4646.74 --> 4647.76]  The Day Metallica
[4647.76 --> 4648.52]  Came to Church,
[4649.02 --> 4649.88]  John Van Sloten,
[4650.52 --> 4651.08]  he writes,
[4651.50 --> 4651.86]  he says,
[4652.12 --> 4653.00]  in all the great
[4653.00 --> 4653.94]  things in life,
[4654.06 --> 4654.98]  what we are really
[4654.98 --> 4655.86]  looking for
[4655.86 --> 4656.66]  is God.
[4657.70 --> 4658.52]  And he expands
[4658.52 --> 4659.04]  on this point.
[4659.12 --> 4659.44]  He says,
[4659.76 --> 4660.44]  in the joy
[4660.44 --> 4661.40]  of a baseball game,
[4661.48 --> 4662.10]  we are looking
[4662.10 --> 4662.98]  for the joy
[4662.98 --> 4663.64]  of God.
[4664.18 --> 4665.16]  In the perfection
[4665.16 --> 4665.90]  of a balanced
[4665.90 --> 4666.84]  math equation,
[4666.84 --> 4667.76]  we are really
[4667.76 --> 4668.34]  looking for
[4668.34 --> 4668.96]  the perfection
[4668.96 --> 4669.94]  of God.
[4669.94 --> 4671.24]  in trying to find
[4671.24 --> 4671.86]  and establish
[4671.86 --> 4672.54]  and maintain
[4672.54 --> 4673.28]  relationships
[4673.28 --> 4673.94]  with family
[4673.94 --> 4674.68]  and friends,
[4675.00 --> 4675.96]  husbands and wives,
[4676.38 --> 4676.76]  teammates,
[4676.98 --> 4677.62]  brothers and sisters,
[4677.82 --> 4678.24]  co-workers,
[4678.56 --> 4679.50]  whomever it is,
[4679.60 --> 4680.34]  what we are really
[4680.34 --> 4681.16]  trying to do
[4681.16 --> 4682.10]  is fill the void
[4682.10 --> 4683.22]  of that one relationship
[4683.22 --> 4684.34]  that was lost,
[4684.48 --> 4685.34]  the one relationship
[4685.34 --> 4686.60]  that we were created
[4686.60 --> 4687.92]  to be in.
[4689.68 --> 4690.88]  We look for people
[4690.88 --> 4691.96]  to belong to
[4691.96 --> 4692.96]  so that we can have
[4692.96 --> 4693.60]  a name
[4693.60 --> 4694.80]  and a place.
[4695.18 --> 4696.08]  What this truth
[4696.08 --> 4697.58]  about God
[4697.58 --> 4698.60]  and being created
[4698.60 --> 4699.46]  in God's image
[4699.46 --> 4700.78]  and our need
[4700.78 --> 4701.22]  for him,
[4701.30 --> 4701.80]  our hearts being
[4701.80 --> 4702.70]  restless in him
[4702.70 --> 4703.42]  until they rest
[4703.42 --> 4704.20]  in him,
[4704.72 --> 4705.32]  what this truth
[4705.32 --> 4706.06]  teaches us
[4706.06 --> 4707.02]  is that we have
[4707.02 --> 4707.88]  a name
[4707.88 --> 4708.64]  and we have
[4708.64 --> 4709.28]  a place,
[4709.40 --> 4710.44]  we have an identity,
[4710.88 --> 4711.86]  we have a family
[4711.86 --> 4712.84]  and our identity
[4712.84 --> 4714.22]  is truly only
[4714.22 --> 4714.86]  understood
[4714.86 --> 4715.88]  in relationship
[4715.88 --> 4716.88]  to God
[4716.88 --> 4718.12]  and anything else
[4718.12 --> 4719.52]  is a cheap substitute.
[4719.92 --> 4720.48]  Anything else
[4720.48 --> 4721.70]  won't fill the void,
[4721.94 --> 4722.64]  won't satisfy
[4722.64 --> 4723.18]  the hunger
[4723.18 --> 4724.00]  of your heart.
[4724.26 --> 4724.82]  Anything else
[4724.82 --> 4726.56]  just won't do it.
[4727.58 --> 4729.58]  At the beginning
[4729.58 --> 4730.26]  I said that this
[4730.26 --> 4731.16]  was really about
[4731.16 --> 4732.22]  anthropology.
[4733.62 --> 4734.90]  What we're seeing
[4734.90 --> 4735.76]  is that
[4735.76 --> 4737.66]  the only way
[4737.66 --> 4738.64]  to have a true
[4738.64 --> 4739.96]  comprehensive
[4739.96 --> 4741.10]  anthropology
[4741.10 --> 4742.42]  is to have
[4742.42 --> 4743.36]  a biblical one.
[4744.82 --> 4745.68]  Bible-believing
[4745.68 --> 4746.24]  Christians
[4746.24 --> 4747.40]  understand something
[4747.40 --> 4748.60]  about being human
[4748.60 --> 4749.46]  that no other
[4749.46 --> 4750.56]  person can.
[4751.04 --> 4752.16]  You are created
[4752.16 --> 4752.82]  for God.
[4752.82 --> 4753.90]  You are created
[4753.90 --> 4755.02]  to glorify God
[4755.02 --> 4755.82]  and enjoy him
[4755.82 --> 4756.36]  forever.
[4756.36 --> 4757.22]  You are not
[4757.22 --> 4757.86]  your own
[4757.86 --> 4758.60]  but belong
[4758.60 --> 4759.50]  body and soul
[4759.50 --> 4760.28]  to your faithful
[4760.28 --> 4760.96]  savior.
[4761.16 --> 4761.80]  You were bought
[4761.80 --> 4762.64]  with a price
[4762.64 --> 4763.78]  because beings
[4763.78 --> 4764.98]  created in the image
[4764.98 --> 4765.44]  of God
[4765.44 --> 4766.62]  are worth everything
[4766.62 --> 4767.52]  to God.
[4767.80 --> 4768.90]  That is who you are.
[4770.76 --> 4771.98]  And seeing this truth,
[4772.30 --> 4773.20]  knowing this truth
[4773.20 --> 4773.90]  about God
[4773.90 --> 4774.90]  and about yourself
[4774.90 --> 4776.18]  begins to
[4776.18 --> 4777.68]  unveil
[4777.68 --> 4779.12]  the true beauty
[4779.12 --> 4780.28]  of God
[4780.28 --> 4781.46]  and the gospel.
[4783.36 --> 4783.78]  God
[4783.78 --> 4786.14]  is beautiful.
[4787.14 --> 4787.96]  That Jesus
[4787.96 --> 4788.90]  lived the life
[4788.90 --> 4789.80]  I should have lived
[4789.80 --> 4791.04]  and died the death
[4791.04 --> 4791.60]  that I deserve
[4791.60 --> 4792.50]  that three days
[4792.50 --> 4793.68]  later he was raised
[4793.68 --> 4794.86]  victorious over sin
[4794.86 --> 4795.46]  and death
[4795.46 --> 4796.88]  and that by his grace
[4796.88 --> 4797.60]  my sin
[4797.60 --> 4798.92]  is placed on him
[4798.92 --> 4800.18]  and his righteousness
[4800.18 --> 4801.98]  is given to me.
[4802.38 --> 4803.32]  That gospel
[4803.32 --> 4804.94]  is beautiful
[4804.94 --> 4806.80]  and you
[4806.80 --> 4808.84]  get to
[4808.84 --> 4809.80]  see
[4809.80 --> 4810.70]  that
[4810.70 --> 4811.64]  beauty.
[4812.36 --> 4813.40]  You get to
[4813.40 --> 4813.96]  be
[4813.96 --> 4814.98]  that
[4814.98 --> 4815.94]  beauty.
[4816.94 --> 4817.84]  By grace
[4817.84 --> 4818.76]  through faith
[4818.76 --> 4819.34]  you
[4819.34 --> 4820.78]  are the bride
[4820.78 --> 4821.54]  beautifully
[4821.54 --> 4822.40]  adorned
[4822.40 --> 4823.54]  for the bridegroom
[4823.54 --> 4825.70]  and if the beautiful
[4825.70 --> 4826.96]  life is defined
[4826.96 --> 4828.10]  by being in
[4828.10 --> 4828.48]  Jesus
[4828.48 --> 4829.36]  by this relationship
[4829.36 --> 4829.74]  to God
[4829.74 --> 4830.78]  then the beautiful
[4830.78 --> 4831.94]  life looks
[4831.94 --> 4832.84]  like living
[4832.84 --> 4833.96]  as Jesus
[4833.96 --> 4834.86]  lived.
[4835.42 --> 4836.14]  Obedience
[4836.14 --> 4836.60]  to God
[4836.60 --> 4837.72]  radical obedience
[4837.72 --> 4839.02]  while the world
[4839.02 --> 4840.34]  thinks it's impossible
[4840.34 --> 4841.24]  and will never
[4841.24 --> 4842.08]  understand it
[4842.08 --> 4843.02]  they think it's
[4843.02 --> 4844.02]  ludicrous and crazy
[4844.02 --> 4846.20]  that's actually
[4846.20 --> 4847.56]  the beautiful
[4847.56 --> 4848.30]  life you were
[4848.30 --> 4848.78]  created
[4848.78 --> 4850.24]  to live.
[4851.88 --> 4852.24]  Obedience
[4852.24 --> 4852.60]  to God
[4852.60 --> 4852.80]  you see
[4852.80 --> 4853.60]  isn't a burden
[4853.60 --> 4854.44]  it is a
[4854.44 --> 4855.20]  blossoming
[4855.20 --> 4856.44]  of his image
[4856.44 --> 4857.02]  in you
[4857.02 --> 4858.16]  and his grace
[4858.16 --> 4859.36]  through you
[4859.36 --> 4861.84]  and that beauty
[4861.84 --> 4863.76]  is affective
[4863.76 --> 4865.40]  notice I said
[4865.40 --> 4866.20]  affective
[4866.20 --> 4867.14]  not effective
[4867.14 --> 4867.60]  that is
[4867.60 --> 4868.40]  it speaks
[4868.40 --> 4869.06]  to the heart
[4869.06 --> 4870.26]  that beauty
[4870.26 --> 4871.22]  and the beauty
[4871.22 --> 4871.76]  of Jesus
[4871.76 --> 4872.46]  disciples
[4872.46 --> 4873.90]  and his church
[4873.90 --> 4875.26]  is the beauty
[4875.26 --> 4876.10]  that God uses
[4876.10 --> 4877.26]  to open eyes
[4877.26 --> 4878.08]  and hearts
[4878.08 --> 4879.62]  people may never
[4879.62 --> 4880.70]  see the hole
[4880.70 --> 4881.40]  in their hearts
[4881.40 --> 4882.08]  that only God
[4882.08 --> 4882.56]  can fill
[4882.56 --> 4883.54]  but they will
[4883.54 --> 4884.56]  see the beauty
[4884.56 --> 4885.46]  of those
[4885.46 --> 4886.04]  who have been
[4886.04 --> 4886.74]  filled by God
[4886.74 --> 4887.06]  amen
[4887.06 --> 4890.46]  Pascal goes
[4890.46 --> 4891.02]  on to say
[4891.02 --> 4893.18]  men despise
[4893.18 --> 4893.62]  religion
[4893.62 --> 4895.12]  they hate it
[4895.12 --> 4895.86]  and are afraid
[4895.86 --> 4896.76]  it may be true
[4896.76 --> 4898.26]  the cure for this
[4898.26 --> 4899.38]  is to make it
[4899.38 --> 4900.10]  attractive
[4900.10 --> 4902.78]  make good men
[4902.78 --> 4903.88]  wish it were true
[4903.88 --> 4904.54]  and then
[4904.54 --> 4905.40]  show
[4905.40 --> 4906.78]  that it is
[4906.78 --> 4909.08]  you were
[4909.08 --> 4909.80]  made
[4909.80 --> 4910.74]  for
[4910.74 --> 4911.96]  God
[4911.96 --> 4913.40]  you are
[4913.40 --> 4914.24]  made
[4914.24 --> 4915.42]  beautiful
[4915.42 --> 4916.80]  by the gospel
[4916.80 --> 4918.24]  go
[4918.24 --> 4919.80]  and show
[4919.80 --> 4920.32]  the world
[4920.32 --> 4921.78]  what it is
[4921.78 --> 4922.06]  missing
[4922.06 --> 4922.74]  go
[4922.74 --> 4923.44]  and show
[4923.44 --> 4923.98]  the world
[4923.98 --> 4924.66]  who
[4924.66 --> 4926.08]  it is
[4926.08 --> 4926.40]  missing
[4926.40 --> 4927.56]  amen
[4927.56 --> 4928.62]  let's pray
[4928.62 --> 4929.00]  together
[4929.00 --> 4937.26]  God of
[4937.26 --> 4937.72]  all
[4937.72 --> 4938.74]  glory
[4938.74 --> 4940.82]  you've
[4940.82 --> 4941.76]  revealed
[4941.76 --> 4942.20]  yourself
[4942.20 --> 4943.02]  to us
[4943.02 --> 4943.98]  in your
[4943.98 --> 4944.30]  word
[4944.30 --> 4945.86]  you have
[4945.86 --> 4946.46]  transformed
[4946.46 --> 4946.80]  us
[4946.80 --> 4947.06]  by the
[4947.06 --> 4947.34]  power
[4947.34 --> 4948.02]  of your
[4948.02 --> 4948.54]  spirit

[4949.56 --> 4950.28]  through faith
[4950.28 --> 4951.12]  we are
[4951.12 --> 4951.64]  a new
[4951.64 --> 4952.46]  creation
[4952.46 --> 4953.06]  by grace
[4953.06 --> 4953.58]  through faith
[4953.58 --> 4954.10]  we are
[4954.10 --> 4954.88]  adopted

[4956.02 --> 4956.58]  by grace
[4956.58 --> 4957.12]  through faith
[4957.12 --> 4957.46]  we are
[4957.46 --> 4957.98]  heirs of
[4957.98 --> 4958.24]  God
[4958.24 --> 4958.92]  and co-heirs
[4958.92 --> 4959.76]  with Christ
[4959.76 --> 4960.32]  by grace

[4960.92 --> 4961.88]  we are being
[4961.88 --> 4962.48]  transformed
[4962.48 --> 4963.18]  from one
[4963.18 --> 4963.76]  degree of
[4963.76 --> 4964.12]  glory
[4964.12 --> 4964.80]  to another

[4978.72 --> 4979.16]  make any
[4979.16 --> 4979.52]  sense
[4979.52 --> 4980.22]  to anyone
