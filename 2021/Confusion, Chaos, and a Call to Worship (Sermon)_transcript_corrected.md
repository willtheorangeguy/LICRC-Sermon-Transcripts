[0.00 → 10.38] this morning in our worship we're going to start a new series together we're gonna
[10.38 → 20.94] spend the next few weeks looking at the book of Habakkuk Mr. Eric there's one B not
[20.94 → 28.08] Habakkuk so we're going to spend our time in Habakkuk, and we're going to read this morning the first 13
[28.08 → 34.26] verses and so really encourage you as always to open a Bible have that up on your phone whatever
[34.26 → 39.92] the case may be it will also be on the screen but if you have a Bible or with your phone in hand you
[39.92 → 48.38] can refer back as we go through I'm going to read starting at verse 1 through to verse 13.
[48.38 → 60.80] The Oracle that Habakkuk the prophet received how long oh Lord must I call for help, but you do not
[60.80 → 68.86] listen or cry out to you violence, but you do not save why do you make me look at injustice why do
[68.86 → 74.98] you tolerate wrong destruction and violence are before me there is strife and conflict abounds
[74.98 → 83.76] therefore the law is paralyzed and justice never prevails the wicked hem in the righteous so that
[83.76 → 92.00] justice is perverted look at the nations and watch and be utterly amazed for I am going to do something
[92.00 → 100.90] in your days that you would not believe even if I told you I am raising up the Babylonians that
[100.90 → 107.48] are ruthless and impetuous people who sweep across the whole earth to seize dwelling places not their
[107.48 → 113.86] own they are a feared and dreaded people they are a law unto themselves and promote their own honour
[113.86 → 121.56] their horses are swifter than leopards fiercer than wolves at dusk their cavalry gallops headlong
[121.56 → 130.40] their horsemen come from afar they fly like a vulture swooping to devour they all come bent on violence
[130.40 → 138.64] their hordes advance like a desert wind and gather prisoners like sand they deride kings and scoff at
[138.64 → 145.10] rulers they laugh at fortified cities they build earth and ramps and capture them then they sweep past
[145.10 → 155.76] like the wind and go on guilty men whose own strength is their God oh Lord are you not from everlasting
[155.76 → 164.60] my God my holy one we will not die oh Lord you have appointed them to execute judgment oh rock you have
[164.60 → 174.96] ordained them to punish your eyes are too pure to look on evil you cannot tolerate wrong why then do you
[174.96 → 185.28] tolerate the treacherous why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves
[185.28 → 187.76] this is the word of the Lord
[187.76 → 206.48] as we begin together this morning I am well aware of what our experience has been for the past year
[206.48 → 215.76] and we are well aware of the unknown and the confusion and the chaos that exists in the midst of the right now
[215.76 → 224.56] a series that we are beginning this morning I'm calling wrecked and worshipping, and it comes out of a context
[224.56 → 232.72] in which many of us are just feeling wrecked and weak and overwhelmed with everything that has been going on
[232.72 → 243.12] now as we jump into this first know that you are not alone that we are all experiencing this together
[243.12 → 250.16] and we all have these kinds of experiences and out of that we all ask the same sorts of questions and so
[250.16 → 258.00] let's ask those questions today together I'll begin with a bit of a personal story
[260.00 → 269.28] a number of years ago while I was still in seminary I had what you know I would call rightly I think a crisis
[269.28 → 276.88] of faith I was in seminary and I was taking a graduate level class on post-enlightenment philosophy
[276.88 → 283.60] and I was reading a lot of books and a lot of essays from people who were just opposed to orthodox
[283.60 → 289.68] biblical Christianity and these authors in their writing right would challenge the authority of the bible
[289.68 → 297.44] they would attempt to kind of dismantle the claims of authority of faith and the rationality of faith and
[297.44 → 303.76] they would challenge right from the very existence of god on the basis of reason or science or logic or
[303.76 → 314.88] history or whatever the case may have been I was reading this all and unfortunately due to the busyness of
[314.88 → 321.92] my schedule in school I didn't make time to read other things to read good things constructive things
[321.92 → 333.36] devotional things helpful things, and so I was eventually consumed by the chaos of this thinking
[333.36 → 341.92] and thought and I began to slide and slide and slide and I slipped into a time that can only be called
[341.92 → 349.68] spiritual depression right and maybe faith apathy and for a couple of months maybe even half a year
[349.68 → 360.48] my friends and I would argue and debate, and we would fight and I would push buttons and I would raise concerns
[360.48 → 368.56] and I would make arguments against faith and Christianity together and I was in seminary remember
[369.20 → 374.24] and a good seminary at that it got dark in my heart
[374.24 → 385.52] and I would challenge my friends and my professors and myself and how could god let this kind of thing
[385.52 → 393.52] happen right how could god create a world in which he knew there would be sin right down to the
[393.52 → 400.08] sometimes more complicated questions of why is there no external evidence for the resurrection of Jesus don't
[400.08 → 405.28] you think that the annals of Roman history would have recorded something as significant or important as that
[408.00 → 413.20] really I was in deep and I was spiralling out of control
[415.28 → 423.36] I suspect many of you if not all of us know what that's like right I was in seminary training to be a
[423.36 → 428.88] minister of the word and I had these doubts I had this crisis of faith I had this spiritual depression
[428.88 → 434.40] and if church leaders like me or future church leaders back than like me can face those kinds of
[434.40 → 443.12] things surely everyone do I know that many of us had these sorts of struggles maybe you aren't sure
[443.12 → 451.44] what to believe or if you believe or even if belief is possible maybe you're there right now maybe you're here
[451.44 → 459.92] looking for answers maybe you know someone who's there right now maybe you have questions, but you don't
[459.92 → 469.92] know who to ask or how to ask them whatever the case may be I think we all know what it is to have a crisis of faith
[471.76 → 479.20] now the sort of pinnacle of my crisis of faith, or maybe we could say the deepest part of my crisis of faith
[479.20 → 485.44] came down to one thing and that's what I now know to be called the problem of evil
[486.88 → 492.72] right really simply if god was perfect and loving and all-powerful then he wouldn't let people
[492.72 → 499.44] who love him go through these bad things right since good people go through evil things either
[499.44 → 505.36] god isn't good, or he isn't all-powerful in which case in either case he wouldn't be god
[505.36 → 514.56] that's the question really that's the state of belief that we will address this morning that
[514.56 → 522.24] Habakkuk is finding himself in the middle of this is Habakkuk's struggle it is our struggle it's really
[522.24 → 526.24] every human person's struggle whether you have a religious answer to it or not
[526.24 → 536.32] why is there evil in the world what I hope, and it's my prayer that this morning we will see that
[536.32 → 544.16] that god is bigger than our struggles with evil that evil has been decisively dealt with in history
[544.16 → 554.32] and that for god to be god he must have his reasons for everything we face in life even the evil things
[554.32 → 562.48] now to get there this morning we start with the back now let me set the stage for you with a little
[562.48 → 567.76] bit of history and I'll try to do this quickly because I know not everybody loves history the way that I do
[569.20 → 576.24] in actual fact we know very little about the prophet Habakkuk right who he is and what he did as a prophet
[576.24 → 582.64] whether he was in the official temple system as a prophet or if he was outside the official system as one
[582.64 → 590.88] especially called by god, but we can figure out when he roughly prophesied right Habakkuk is a prophet in
[590.88 → 601.20] Judah which is the southern kingdom, and it's around 600 to 610 bc and so it's near what we now call the
[601.20 → 608.88] end of the first temple period right these are the last kings in Israel and Judah for those of us who
[608.88 → 616.40] know the sort of bigger story of the drama of redemption we might say that this is near the beginning
[617.12 → 625.12] of the exile period which started in 586 bc with the fall of Jerusalem so what's happening on the global scale is
[625.12 → 634.80] the Babylonians are shifting the balance of power now we have a map that's going to appear on-screen and that will
[634.80 → 641.04] help you see what's going on and where it's happening as I tell the story, and you see the map there those
[641.04 → 647.68] circles and the legend down the side moves through in the manner in which I will tell the story one through
[647.68 → 657.36] six I think it is so Israel and then later the smaller Judah have been allies with the Babylonians
[657.36 → 665.76] going back to when they were first called the Chaldeans in 705 bc you have king Hezekiah king
[665.76 → 671.84] Hezekiah this happens in the time of the prophet Isaiah to draw some lines for you Isaiah also prophet
[671.84 → 678.88] prophesied about the exile that would come Hezekiah who is king worked with the Chaldeans to repel
[678.88 → 685.44] the armies of one Sennacherib as he marched through Israel down towards Jerusalem
[685.44 → 693.28] now a century later the Chaldeans now the sort of neo-Babylonian right have defeated Assyria who
[693.28 → 700.24] had an empire in 612 with the fall of nineveh was the capital city of the Assyrian empire
[701.52 → 710.32] and in 609 bc the Egyptians start marching their way east and north through the crescent of the
[710.32 → 717.20] around the Mediterranean in a last ditch attempt to partner with the Assyrians to defeat the
[717.20 → 726.24] Babylonians in the battle of Harlan but this time as the Egyptians marched through king Josiah of Judah
[726.24 → 732.24] would come with the armies of Judah, and he would attempt to stop the advancement of the Egyptians
[732.24 → 741.12] who were led by pharaoh neo the second now king Josiah is killed in this battle at Megiddo trying
[741.12 → 749.60] to help their allies the Babylonians in 605 you have the battle of arcades that happens on the
[749.60 → 756.64] Euphrates river and here the Babylonians finally and decisively defeat the Egyptians and send them back
[756.64 → 765.76] to Egypt now all around the region of Syria and Israel the Babylonians have taken over and this
[765.76 → 772.88] battle after this battle rather the Babylonians that come in and annex Judah they take control of the
[772.88 → 780.64] region of Judah, and they start treating them as a hostile vassal state as you see backtracking just a
[780.64 → 789.68] few years after Josiah is killed in the battle at Megiddo pharaoh neo the second left his armies in
[789.68 → 797.36] the region as they continued on to go battle against the Babylonians, and he returned with a group back
[797.36 → 804.08] to Egypt and on his way through Jerusalem returning to Egypt he deposed the new king who was the
[804.08 → 813.20] younger son of Josiah Jehovah has and took him back to Egypt as a prisoner, and instead he installed jehoiakim
[813.20 → 822.56] another son of Josiah as a puppet king now jehoiakim agreed to and paid the levy that Egypt imposed on
[822.56 → 831.92] Judah now jehoiakim gets very little on the pages of the bible but in second kings 23 verse 37 it says
[831.92 → 841.04] that he did evil in the eyes of the lord just as his predecessors had done but still even with that
[841.04 → 850.40] happening many in Judah would have considered Babylon's actions a betrayal because they had been historical
[850.40 → 852.24] allies for a century
[852.24 → 858.40] and so you can imagine how Habakkuk feels
[860.88 → 870.88] when the lord says I am raising up Babylon to exercise my justice right part of the evil that
[870.88 → 878.72] Habakkuk is reacting to right that Babylon betrayed them that's why he calls them a treacherous people in
[878.72 → 886.96] verse 13 right and the word that's used there in Hebrew can mean disloyal or betrayers right that's why
[888.00 → 897.04] Habakkuk feels so torn now this is sort of the global backdrop and if the map is still up we can take
[897.04 → 903.36] that down this is sort of the global backdrop to what's going on right there's warfare and there's
[903.36 → 911.04] evil everywhere and Judah is caught up in the middle of it right they are dying, and they're being taken
[911.04 → 920.88] prisoner right evil is literally to the north and south and east, and it's pressing in on them with vigour
[923.04 → 930.16] but there's also a more local concern that's causing Habakkuk to cry out to the lord
[930.16 → 936.88] I've already mentioned two names that we can come back to here right king Josiah and king jehoiakim
[938.00 → 945.44] now Josiah as king instituted a number of reforms in Jerusalem and really brought the people back to
[945.44 → 953.60] a more biblical faith and a more biblical practice of worship but before him and after him the religious
[953.60 → 961.28] and political leadership are corrupt and even abusive right look at what Habakkuk says in verse 4 he
[961.28 → 969.28] says the law is paralyzed and justice never prevails now that word translated paralyzed can mean numb
[970.08 → 975.60] right like when your foot falls asleep, and you try to stand only to find that you just collapse to the
[975.60 → 983.52] floor and fall over right the rulers and rule of law have become numb to the plight of ordinary citizens
[985.68 → 994.56] there's a general uh biblical scholarly consensus that Habakkuk is reacting to the abuses of power
[994.56 → 1001.28] that have further marginalized the poor and exploited the less privileged, and we know from the rest of the
[1001.28 → 1008.48] the bible that jehoiakim is accused of dishonest gain he has forced people into unpaid labour to build his
[1008.48 → 1015.44] houses he's taxed people to pay the levy that the Egyptians have imposed we know that jehoiakim is
[1015.44 → 1021.76] implicated in the obstruction of justice in the shedding of innocent blood and in the murder of prophets
[1021.76 → 1033.68] the point is evil and injustice are everywhere globally the Babylonians have betrayed them and locally the
[1033.68 → 1043.20] king has never looked out for them the moral order of Habakkuk's world has been upended things aren't the way
[1043.20 → 1051.12] they should be evil prevails over good injustice over justice death over life and Habakkuk cries out and
[1051.12 → 1060.88] says since god is good his world should be good too but in Habakkuk's eyes it's not that's the problem
[1062.48 → 1069.92] and like we said I'm going to guess that that's not just Habakkuk's problem right and in fact it's not just
[1069.92 → 1078.32] an intellectual issue right a question to be answered right every single person who says they are a
[1078.32 → 1085.92] Christian or a theist really of any stripe has to wrestle with the question if god is god and god is
[1085.92 → 1092.96] good why is there evil in the world but like I said it's not just an intellectual issue for us right
[1092.96 → 1101.44] there are racial tensions and realities that beg the question of why god there are issues of poverty and hunger
[1101.44 → 1108.00] globally and locally that beg the question if you are good why is there so much bad right there are
[1108.00 → 1114.48] issues of violence against women and children of issues of parents losing children of marriages
[1114.48 → 1121.04] breaking up that beg the question that cause us to cry out like we began our worship this morning how long
[1121.04 → 1132.96] oh lord we've got cancer and covid and countless others chronic diseases that rob us of life and the ability
[1132.96 → 1142.00] to live things aren't the way they should be evil prevails over good injustice over justice life over death
[1142.00 → 1148.24] and since god is good his world should be good too but in so many ways it's not
[1150.56 → 1153.12] how long oh lord
[1156.56 → 1165.68] now to start addressing this situation I want you to notice something carefully in the text
[1165.68 → 1175.68] starting in verse 3 Habakkuk says destruction and violence are before me there is strife and conflict
[1175.68 → 1184.88] abounds therefore the law is paralyzed and justice never prevails and notice two things here right
[1185.28 → 1194.32] Habakkuk is making an assertion in these words right first because he sees violence and destruction and
[1194.32 → 1202.48] strife and conflict that's why the law is paralyzed or numb and justice doesn't prevail right because of all
[1202.48 → 1210.40] that he can see his conclusion is that god is absent or his goodness challenged but think carefully
[1210.40 → 1217.60] with me right that's all he can see and in a sense it's all he sees
[1217.60 → 1229.36] but we know that Habakkuk doesn't see all right, and it's really than from his limited perspective
[1229.36 → 1234.80] that he ends up making these universal and absolute statements about the nature of god
[1235.92 → 1241.20] right the person who raises the problem of evil as an argument against the existence of god and this
[1241.20 → 1246.40] was me a number of years ago the person who raises the problem of evil as an argument against the existence
[1246.40 → 1252.72] of god presumes that we have the right viewpoint from which to make those sorts of absolute kinds of
[1252.72 → 1263.04] statements this is Habakkuk's problem this was my problem this is our problem and what's more when you
[1263.04 → 1272.96] say that you are presupposing that something true will be knowable experientially and empirically that it
[1272.96 → 1279.44] will be knowable to all but that's just obviously not true right just because we don't we can't
[1279.44 → 1286.96] understand it doesn't mean god does not have good intentions for allowing such things to happen or even
[1286.96 → 1296.96] using them like he uses the Babylonians now of course we can't always prove we can't always even know
[1296.96 → 1304.24] the reasons that god has or his ways right and I'm not trying to prove that all I want to say is that
[1304.24 → 1312.32] he has them and the question really that remains for me is what takes more faith right does it take
[1312.32 → 1318.48] more faith to believe that god has a purpose for all the events to that occur or does it take more faith
[1318.48 → 1323.36] to believe that there is no purpose there is no god there is no director of history and all of it
[1323.36 → 1327.76] stumbles blindly forward or to me the answer is obvious
[1330.64 → 1341.68] in actual fact for any of our suffering to make any sense god has to be sovereignly in control of all of
[1341.68 → 1349.92] history right if he isn't none of my suffering makes sense or has any purpose or greater good or greater
[1349.92 → 1357.60] glory in the purposes of god and I can never know which may or which may not be for his glory and his
[1357.60 → 1365.36] purpose but if he is sovereignly in control of everything then everything is for his purpose
[1365.36 → 1376.32] and if god isn't in control that's actually what's truly heartbreaking and the second thing then to
[1376.32 → 1387.60] see from Habakkuk comes when he says justice never prevails now that's a really strong word right
[1387.60 → 1395.12] when we struggle or face suffering or challenging situations right it is individual human nature to
[1395.36 → 1402.40] um exaggerate or to hyperbolize right my kids even do this or Mr Eric even does this right and says
[1402.40 → 1411.28] this is the worst it's just a mouse in your car the worst but that's what we do right we make things out
[1411.28 → 1418.32] to be big and huge and universal and look I'm not trying to be unsympathetic right and I don't want to
[1419.20 → 1424.32] diminish or minimize the hardships and struggles that we face
[1425.52 → 1434.80] and I'll concede that that even at that moment that may be the worst for you that may be the hardest
[1434.80 → 1444.64] thing you have ever faced but is it the absolute right does justice never prevail when justice isn't
[1444.64 → 1456.00] prevailing, but you catch the difference that we're making now look and here's what it comes down to
[1458.00 → 1464.80] will we have enough humility to let god be god
[1464.80 → 1472.96] now let me be really clear again right we may never know the reasons that god does something or
[1472.96 → 1480.00] doesn't do other things or permit some things to happen all we can do in faith is trust and believe
[1480.00 → 1489.36] that god is god and that he has his glorious reasons I love the words of the Christian philosopher
[1489.36 → 1498.08] named peter reef he says this he says the Christian god has come to earth to deliberately put himself
[1498.64 → 1506.00] on the hook of human suffering let me be clear on the hook of human suffering not for human suffering
[1506.00 → 1513.28] he's not taking responsibility for it, he is living in it on the cross in Jesus Christ reef continues
[1513.28 → 1521.52] god experienced the greatest depths of pain therefore though Christianity does not provide all the
[1521.52 → 1529.12] reasons for each experience of pain it provides deep resources for actually facing suffering with hope
[1529.12 → 1538.72] and courage rather than with bitterness and despair end quote because Jesus came and lived the life of
[1538.72 → 1547.20] perfect righteousness and died the death that is my penalty for sin I can face tomorrow because this
[1547.20 → 1555.84] is my father's world, and he has laid its foundations and controls every aspect of it because he has made all
[1555.84 → 1566.80] that is fair I can live today though he slays me I will yet praise him
[1569.76 → 1576.32] here's where we will end this morning and in a few weeks pastor Kevin is going to preach on this text
[1576.32 → 1580.88] explicitly, and so I'm not going to steal his thunder now but if your bibles are open flip over to chapter
[1580.88 → 1591.20] three and look at verse 17 chapter 3 verse 17 Habakkuk writes though the fig tree does not bud and there
[1591.20 → 1598.56] are no grapes on the vines though the olive crop fails, and the fields produce no food though there are
[1598.56 → 1605.12] no sheep in the pen no cattle in the stalls in other words though nothing is the way it's supposed to be
[1605.12 → 1611.60] though there isn't any prosperity and only hardship and suffering yet Habakkuk says I will rejoice in the
[1611.60 → 1622.16] lord I will be joyful in god my saviour the sovereign lord is my strength he makes my feet like the feet of
[1622.16 → 1633.84] a deer, and he enables me to go to the heights what is the antidote to our experience of the problem
[1633.84 → 1640.32] of evil what is the antidote to those times and places where our belief in god is challenged because
[1640.32 → 1654.08] of the evil and injustice we see in the world worship right we may be wrecked we may be facing
[1654.08 → 1662.64] trials of all kinds right we live in a time of confusion and chaos, but god is calling us to worship
[1663.84 → 1684.80] the glory of god worship is crying out how long worship is lament worship is seething prayers calling for god's justice
[1684.80 → 1691.20] worship is tears at the brokenness we are in the midst of
[1691.20 → 1704.72] but instead of unbelief in response to evil imagine what your life imagine what our life together imagine
[1704.72 → 1712.96] what our world would look like if instead of unbelief in response to evil instead of apathy instead of fear
[1712.96 → 1724.80] fear instead what if we worshipped I promise you when doubts and hardships come, and they will
[1726.88 → 1734.56] and if when they do you worship more and not less truly worshipped right in spirit and in truth in song
[1734.56 → 1744.88] and in word and in sacrament if you worship when you are wrecked you will find rest for your souls because you
[1744.88 → 1748.24] will be found by Jesus
[1750.32 → 1752.48] that is the point
[1754.48 → 1763.20] that is why we are called to worship in the midst of confusion and chaos that is the legacy of Habakkuk for us
[1763.76 → 1766.00] today I pray
[1768.48 → 1777.28] that you know that story of faith and I pray that when your faith is broken, and you can't do it that
[1777.28 → 1779.60] there are people in your life who will lift you up
[1782.00 → 1782.80] and if there aren't
[1784.80 → 1790.48] would you let me be that person if there aren't would you let someone from church one of our elders or a
[1790.48 → 1794.88] small group member or a community group member someone whom you know from this place would you let us
[1794.88 → 1800.08] be that for you because that is the strength of Christian community
[1800.08 → 1805.36] alone we might stay
[1805.36 → 1806.40] alone we might stay wrecked
[1806.40 → 1808.00] but together
[1808.00 → 1809.92] we can worship
[1810.96 → 1811.84] let's pray together
[1811.84 → 1818.72] lord our god we come to you
[1818.72 → 1825.84] in the midst of the chaos of our lives from the midst of the confusion we may be facing now we come to you
[1825.84 → 1827.84] to worship to sing your praises
[1829.04 → 1836.24] we rest god on your sovereign rule on your promise to guide history towards your purpose and
[1836.24 → 1837.68] the glory of your name
[1837.68 → 1847.52] no matter what we face though you may slay us we yet praise you
[1847.52 → 1861.52] in our heart of hearts today may we sing your praise in Jesus name amen
[1861.52 → 1865.52] you
