[0.00 → 10.24] Yours, only by grace, this scarlet story, the final word.
[13.58 → 21.86] On that cross, your life for my salvation, you made a way.
[21.86 → 31.44] My heart has found forgiveness, oh, that day you said my sin was finished.
[32.44 → 37.10] I could never thank you enough.
[40.62 → 46.22] Out of that grave, my Saviour rose.
[46.22 → 52.10] Death lost its claim, once and for all.
[52.62 → 61.22] Breaking the curse, you wrote my story, your finished word.
[61.22 → 67.62] Out of that grave, my Saviour rose.
[67.62 → 72.98] On that cross, your life for my salvation, you made a way.
[72.98 → 82.56] My heart has found forgiveness, oh, that day you said my sin was finished.
[82.56 → 88.54] I could never thank you enough.
[91.00 → 101.00] Just want to say thank you for all that you've done for me.
[101.00 → 110.22] Lord, I receive it, and I believe it.
[110.22 → 112.26] Yeah, yeah.
[112.26 → 118.08] I receive your grace.
[120.70 → 126.66] I receive your peace over me.
[126.66 → 136.58] I receive the power of the cross alive in me.

[168.58 → 174.72] I receive your grace over me.
[174.72 → 184.98] I receive the power of the cross alive in me.

[186.34 → 191.54] I believe I'm healed.
[191.54 → 197.54] I believe your grace over me.
[197.68 → 199.54] I receive your grace.
[199.54 → 209.52] I believe in Jesus Christ, the power inside of me.
[209.52 → 219.54] Oh, on my cross, my life for my salvation, you made a way.
[219.54 → 223.38] My heart is full for you
[223.38 → 229.42] Oh, that thing you said my sin was finished
[229.42 → 234.82] I could never thank you enough
[234.82 → 240.74] I could never thank you enough
[240.74 → 247.30] I could never thank you enough
[249.54 → 279.52] I could never thank you enough
[279.54 → 295.92] I'll lecture to you
[295.92 → 296.66] It's you.
[297.66 → 300.04] Oh, Jesus, it's you.
[302.38 → 307.10] I believe you're the wonder-working God.
[307.10 → 310.46] You're the wonder-working God.
[310.88 → 313.60] You're the miracles I've seen.
[314.18 → 316.80] Too good to not believe.
[317.54 → 320.42] You're the wonder-working God.
[320.94 → 323.56] And you're here because you love.
[323.56 → 326.96] The miracles will see.
[327.36 → 330.10] You're too good to not believe.

[341.48 → 347.06] And I can't resurrect a man with my own hands.
[348.76 → 351.96] But just the mention of your name
[351.96 → 353.76] Can raise the dead.
[355.76 → 361.04] And all the glory to the only one who cares.
[361.04 → 363.66] Jesus, it's you.
[364.24 → 366.90] Oh, Jesus, it's you.

[436.54 → 440.10] Oh, I believe.
[441.68 → 444.24] I see too much to not believe.
[445.52 → 446.62] Yes, I believe.
[447.24 → 448.98] How could I not believe?
[448.98 → 451.38] After everything I've seen.
[452.58 → 455.28] After everything I've seen.
[455.28 → 457.56] Oh, I believe.

[566.40 → 568.80] Good morning, everyone.
[568.80 → 569.60] How are we doing?
[569.60 → 571.30] Good.
[571.30 → 573.80] Okay, how are we doing?
[573.80 → 575.40] There we go.
[575.40 → 577.60] A lively bunch this morning.
[577.60 → 580.54] We are really excited to worship today.
[580.54 → 583.18] We are really excited that you are all here.
[583.18 → 584.88] If you don't know who I am, my name is Chris.
[584.88 → 587.88] I'm one of the pastors here, and it's my privilege this morning,
[587.88 → 592.02] along with these others on stage, to lead you in worship.
[592.02 → 597.02] This morning, we are really, really blessed to celebrate the baptism
[597.02 → 606.26] of three newish little girls in our church community, and so you will see that later on.
[606.26 → 609.90] If you are participating online, we are excited that you are here.
[609.90 → 615.28] Later on in the service, there will be an opportunity for you to respond with the congregation in a voice,
[615.28 → 618.70] and we invite you to do that there as well.
[618.70 → 624.90] Now, sitting here, you've probably noticed, and if you're at home, you've probably figured it out already, too,
[624.90 → 630.74] but we're having the same issue with our pro presenter program that we did last week, and so there are no lyrics,
[630.74 → 634.78] and so you had papers given to you on your way in.
[634.78 → 638.46] Everyone's excited to be here in worship this morning.
[641.02 → 643.68] You had papers given to you on your way in with the lyrics for that.
[643.68 → 649.02] As well, if you are at home, in anticipation that this may happen again,
[649.46 → 656.06] we linked a document to the order of worship in the e-bulletin that has the lyrics to all the psalms.
[656.54 → 659.70] So if you're at home, and you're looking for the lyrics, just scroll down in the e-bulletin.
[659.70 → 666.64] It'll say click here for all the lyrics, and you can click there, and that will take you to what we are singing here this morning.
[668.00 → 671.48] Before we begin, just one announcement from me, and then another one from Josh.
[671.48 → 673.42] So Josh, you get in the wings and come on up.
[674.58 → 679.80] Tonight is youth worship night here at the church, and so if you haven't heard about that,
[679.90 → 684.78] grab Pastor Kevin and ask him what that's all about, but you get to meet here as well.
[685.22 → 689.12] Josh, why don't you do yours, and then we'll do our opening blessing.
[690.02 → 694.64] Hey, everybody. This is on? Yeah? Okay. No, okay.
[695.08 → 698.86] So, hi, Adrian. Hey, this is a message for you and the rest of the young adults.
[699.80 → 703.34] July 24th is the second event of the Prochurch Tournament.
[704.18 → 707.66] It's at Lake Hayden, Hayden Lake, 1030.
[708.12 → 712.24] We're building a raft, and we have to rescue Kevin in the middle of the lake,
[712.48 → 716.38] and if you guys don't show up, Kevin will be stuck there and won't be able to come to church next Sunday.
[719.70 → 725.38] Also, we want to win the tournament. We won the first event, and we want to keep that going,
[725.90 → 728.64] because we need to show will be who's better.
[730.60 → 731.90] It would be great to have you all there.
[732.46 → 734.90] We loved having you at the first event. We had a great turnout.
[734.90 → 737.32] We would love to increase that amount.
[738.62 → 738.98] Yeah.
[745.06 → 747.12] Josh meant to end that by saying,
[747.22 → 749.70] if you have any questions, grab me in the foyer afterwards.
[752.74 → 753.48] And Samara.
[754.22 → 755.76] Samara, wave your hand. I'm going to put you on the spot.
[755.90 → 757.34] That's Samara. Everyone ask her.
[758.22 → 758.50] All right.
[758.50 → 760.64] As you're able, and where you are, I'm going to invite you to stand,
[761.08 → 763.88] and we can come together in the presence of God for worship.
[766.90 → 770.30] God not only calls us into his presence,
[770.42 → 773.76] but he greets us here as we gather in his name,
[773.82 → 776.52] and so receive the greeting of our God.
[777.98 → 778.38] Grace,
[779.46 → 779.84] mercy,
[780.24 → 781.22] and peace to you.
[781.34 → 783.48] From God, our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ,
[783.56 → 784.04] his Son,
[784.36 → 785.04] and our Saviour,
[785.44 → 788.02] through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[789.02 → 789.46] Amen.
[789.96 → 790.92] Let's worship God this morning.
[796.66 → 798.36] Before we call to worship this morning,
[798.52 → 802.16] hear these words from David from 2 Samuel 22.
[804.92 → 806.92] The Lord is my rock,
[807.02 → 807.68] my fortress,
[807.86 → 809.16] and my deliverer.
[809.70 → 811.72] My God is my rock,
[811.90 → 813.24] in whom I take refuge,
[813.84 → 814.82] my shield,
[815.10 → 816.56] and the horn of my salvation.
[816.56 → 819.36] He is my stronghold,
[819.56 → 820.50] my refuge,
[820.58 → 821.40] and my Saviour.
[822.40 → 824.92] For who is God besides the Lord?
[825.70 → 828.20] And who is the rock except our God?
[828.96 → 830.50] The Lord lives.
[831.38 → 833.68] Praise be to my rock.
[834.12 → 835.60] Exalted be my God,
[835.94 → 836.42] the rock,
[836.56 → 837.18] my Saviour.
[838.08 → 838.38] Therefore,
[838.70 → 839.88] I will praise you,
[840.08 → 840.26] Lord,
[840.36 → 841.28] among the nations.

[986.62 → 991.08] And I'll never know
[991.08 → 994.12] How much it comes
[994.12 → 997.12] To see my sin
[997.12 → 1000.62] Upon that throne
[1000.62 → 1003.62] And I'll never know
[1003.62 → 1007.12] How much it comes
[1007.12 → 1010.62] To see my sin
[1010.62 → 1011.16] To see my sin
[1011.16 → 1015.62] Upon that cross

[1037.50 → 1043.08] Altogether wonderful to me
[1043.08 → 1056.06] I think I was so excited to hear everybody sing this morning that I don't even remember how we practiced that song
[1056.06 → 1059.02] But it is wonderful to hear you all
[1059.02 → 1062.64] Please join me in a prayer of compassion and assurance
[1062.64 → 1067.24] Oh God we confess
[1067.24 → 1070.86] That we are often attracted to false gods
[1070.86 → 1073.58] And make sinful choices in life
[1073.58 → 1077.14] We are vulnerable to many temptations
[1077.14 → 1079.14] That can damage us
[1079.14 → 1082.08] In ways that are not always obvious
[1082.08 → 1084.42] Forgive us our sins
[1084.42 → 1086.76] That draw us away from you
[1086.76 → 1090.14] Restore us and clean our hearts
[1090.14 → 1090.82] We pray
[1090.82 → 1094.22] Dear God we are so thankful for the good news
[1094.22 → 1097.92] That you Christ died for our sins and rose again
[1097.92 → 1102.14] And that we who place our trust and faith in you alone
[1102.14 → 1106.06] Are freed to live fully in the power of your grace
[1106.06 → 1108.38] We thank you for your sacrifice
[1108.38 → 1110.52] We thank you for your love
[1110.52 → 1113.94] In the beautiful name of Jesus alone we pray
[1113.94 → 1114.70] Amen
[1120.82 → 1124.22] Through the word and the beginning
[1124.22 → 1127.62] One will call the Lord
[1127.62 → 1129.62] For the Lord
[1129.62 → 1135.54] Through the word and the beginning
[1135.54 → 1140.94] One will call the Lord
[1140.94 → 1144.94] For the Lord
[1144.94 → 1146.86] Through the word and the beginning
[1146.86 → 1152.86] One will call the Lord
[1152.86 → 1164.82] My love and the love and the Lord
[1164.82 → 1166.06] From glory and creation
[1166.06 → 1170.06] In the heart adage
[1170.06 → 1173.48] What a beautiful name it is.
[1173.70 → 1177.00] What a beautiful name it is.
[1177.36 → 1183.70] The name of Jesus Christ, my King.
[1183.70 → 1187.86] What a beautiful name it is.
[1188.36 → 1190.70] Nothing compares to this.
[1191.66 → 1194.52] What a beautiful name it is.
[1194.78 → 1197.94] The name of Jesus.
[1200.06 → 1207.02] You didn't want heaven without us.
[1208.70 → 1214.06] You didn't want heaven without us.
[1215.00 → 1221.06] So Jesus, you brought heaven down.
[1223.06 → 1227.06] Sin was greater, love was greater.
[1227.06 → 1234.02] Sin was greater, what could celebrate us now.
[1234.02 → 1240.98] What a wonderful name it is.
[1240.98 → 1246.94] The name of Jesus Christ, my King.
[1247.94 → 1250.94] What a wonderful name it is.
[1251.94 → 1253.94] Nothing compares to this.
[1255.02 → 1257.94] What a wonderful name it is.
[1257.94 → 1261.22] The name of Jesus.
[1261.22 → 1264.90] What a wonderful name it is.
[1264.90 → 1268.10] The name of Jesus.
[1268.10 → 1273.06] Death could not hold.
[1273.06 → 1277.06] Death could not hold.
[1277.06 → 1298.76] Death could not hold you.
[1298.76 → 1301.76] The veil who are before you.
[1301.76 → 1304.72] The silence of hope.
[1304.72 → 1308.72] The silence of sin and grace.
[1308.72 → 1311.86] The heavens are roaring.
[1311.86 → 1315.54] The praise of your glory.
[1315.72 → 1321.72] For you are raised to life again.
[1321.72 → 1322.78] What a wonderful name it is.
[1322.78 → 1325.20] You have no rival.
[1325.72 → 1328.70] You have no evil.
[1329.66 → 1335.68] Now and forever God you reign.

[1339.72 → 1342.20] Yours is the glory.
[1342.76 → 1349.14] Yours is the name above all names.
[1349.14 → 1362.30] What a powerful name it is, what a powerful name it is, the name of Jesus Christ I give.
[1362.30 → 1369.30] What a powerful name it is, nothing can stand against.
[1370.34 → 1376.54] What a powerful name it is, the name of Jesus.
[1376.54 → 1390.44] You have no rival, you have no ego, now and forever God you reign.
[1390.44 → 1403.84] Yours is the kingdom, yours is the glory, yours is the name above all names.
[1403.84 → 1417.74] What a powerful name it is, what a powerful name it is, the name of Jesus Christ my King.
[1417.74 → 1425.00] What a powerful name it is, nothing can stand against.
[1425.00 → 1439.34] What a powerful name it is, what a powerful name it is, the name of Jesus.
[1439.34 → 1446.96] What a powerful name it is, the name of Jesus.
[1446.96 → 1457.96] What a powerful name it is, the name of Jesus.
[1457.96 → 1462.96] What a powerful name it is, the name of Jesus Christ my King.
[1462.96 → 1478.96] What a powerful name it is, the name of Jesus Christ my King.
[1478.96 → 1483.96] The name of Jesus Christ my King.
[1483.96 → 1488.96] What a powerful name it is, the name of Jesus Christ my King.
[1488.96 → 1492.96] What a powerful name it is, the name of Jesus Christ my King.
[1492.96 → 1504.96] The name of Jesus Christ my King.
[1504.96 → 1508.96] The name of Jesus Christ my King.
[1508.96 → 1515.96] This name of Jesus Christ my King.
[1515.96 → 1527.54] Be thou my wisdom and thou my true word
[1527.54 → 1536.70] I ever with thee and thou with me Lord
[1536.70 → 1544.64] Thou my great Father, I my true Son
[1544.64 → 1555.50] Thou with me dwelling and I with thee one
[1555.50 → 1567.26] Witches I keep on your vain empty grace
[1567.26 → 1575.12] Thou my inheritance, thou and always
[1575.12 → 1585.12] Thou and thou only, first in my heart
[1585.12 → 1594.98] High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art
[1594.98 → 1605.98] High King of heaven, my victory won
[1605.98 → 1615.84] May I reach heaven's joy, so bright heaven's light
[1615.84 → 1624.84] Heart of my own heart, whatever befall
[1624.84 → 1634.70] Till be thy vision, O ruler of all
[1634.70 → 1647.52] You can be seated
[1647.52 → 1652.92] As the worship team makes their way down
[1652.92 → 1656.96] We are going to spend some time together as a community
[1656.96 → 1660.80] Celebrating and recognizing God's faithfulness
[1660.80 → 1664.92] As we have opportunity to administer the sacrament of baptism
[1664.92 → 1668.82] To three of our littlest members
[1668.82 → 1671.74] Now as we come to this, I want to be really clear
[1671.74 → 1673.62] Right, as Reformed Christians
[1673.62 → 1675.80] We do not believe that there's anything magical
[1675.80 → 1679.82] About the water that we apply to the child
[1679.82 → 1683.20] And yet, baptism is a mystery
[1683.20 → 1686.72] Right, the water doesn't wash away original sin
[1686.72 → 1688.08] Or save the child, right
[1688.08 → 1692.22] Only Jesus' life, death, and resurrection does that
[1692.22 → 1696.30] We believe that these little girls, beautiful as they are
[1696.30 → 1698.06] Are sinful by nature
[1698.06 → 1701.60] And the promises of God for the forgiveness of their sins
[1701.60 → 1706.24] In life in the Holy Spirit are offered to them as well
[1706.24 → 1709.96] We baptize infants not out of superstition
[1709.96 → 1711.10] Or out of tradition
[1711.10 → 1713.58] Or because we really like cute babies
[1713.58 → 1714.70] Even though we do
[1714.70 → 1718.76] We baptize infants because they are covenant children
[1718.76 → 1723.14] And therefore should receive the sign of the covenant
[1723.14 → 1725.84] Now in Genesis 15
[1725.84 → 1728.54] God made a covenant with Abraham
[1728.54 → 1733.68] And the covenant was sealed in the sign of circumcision in Genesis 17
[1733.68 → 1736.58] And God promised to bless Abraham
[1736.58 → 1740.76] Now for Abraham, that blessing meant two things in particular
[1740.76 → 1744.34] Offspring, children, and land
[1744.34 → 1748.32] But at the heart of the covenant was God's promise
[1748.32 → 1752.04] That he would be a God to Abraham and his children
[1752.04 → 1755.88] And so God cut a covenant into Israel's flesh
[1755.88 → 1758.98] Carving out for himself a people
[1758.98 → 1762.68] That people would be the light home
[1762.68 → 1765.14] Back to God for all humanity
[1765.14 → 1767.48] Now in the fullness of time
[1767.48 → 1769.68] God sent his son, Jesus
[1769.68 → 1772.76] As the fulfillment of that promise
[1772.76 → 1775.58] And in his death on the cross
[1775.58 → 1778.88] Our old self is dead and buried
[1778.88 → 1780.46] And in his resurrection
[1780.46 → 1783.18] We are raised into new life
[1783.18 → 1787.00] And look forward to that glorious and ultimate new creation
[1787.00 → 1791.04] When we are baptized in the name of the Father
[1791.04 → 1793.12] And of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
[1793.12 → 1797.28] The triune God seals our adoption as his children
[1797.28 → 1801.00] And writes his name invisibly on our foreheads
[1801.00 → 1802.62] Peter writes
[1802.62 → 1804.58] You are a chosen people
[1804.58 → 1806.40] A royal priesthood
[1806.40 → 1807.54] A holy nation
[1807.54 → 1809.40] A people belonging to God
[1809.40 → 1811.08] Once you were not a people
[1811.08 → 1814.46] But now you are the people of God
[1814.46 → 1816.48] By baptism
[1816.48 → 1819.40] We have a new covenant identity
[1819.40 → 1821.66] In Jesus Christ
[1821.66 → 1824.38] And so we come now
[1824.38 → 1826.20] To administer the sacrament of baptism
[1826.20 → 1828.62] Today on these three little girls
[1828.62 → 1830.54] With the weight of church history
[1830.54 → 1831.74] To encourage us
[1831.74 → 1834.30] With the example of redemptive history
[1834.30 → 1835.02] In the scriptures
[1835.02 → 1837.32] To confirm our practice
[1837.32 → 1841.44] We baptize in obedience to Christ's command
[1841.44 → 1844.58] The sacrament that we are about to administer
[1844.58 → 1846.40] Is a sign of inclusion
[1846.40 → 1848.68] Into the covenant community
[1848.68 → 1850.20] As circumcision was
[1850.20 → 1852.42] And the water that we are about to sprinkle
[1852.42 → 1854.34] Is a sign of the cleansing from sin
[1854.34 → 1857.00] As the sprinkled blood of bulls and goats
[1857.00 → 1858.26] In the Old Testament was
[1858.26 → 1861.22] Today we pray
[1861.22 → 1864.38] That Daphne, Hayden, and Sty
[1864.38 → 1867.60] Will take advantage of all their covenant privileges
[1867.60 → 1870.18] That they will acknowledge her Lord
[1870.18 → 1872.14] All the days of her life
[1872.14 → 1873.10] And by faith
[1873.10 → 1876.38] That each will make these promises her own
[1876.38 → 1879.76] Dan and Dismay
[1879.76 → 1881.44] Brandon and Savannah
[1881.44 → 1882.72] And Dan and Rebecca
[1882.72 → 1885.30] Since you have presented your children for baptism
[1885.30 → 1887.62] We're going to ask you a few questions
[1887.62 → 1888.84] Do you mind just standing
[1888.84 → 1891.00] And you can stay where you are for this part
[1891.00 → 1892.76] So that we can all see
[1892.76 → 1895.64] You and where you are
[1895.64 → 1896.74] Excellent
[1896.74 → 1899.78] So I'm going to ask
[1899.78 → 1901.16] A couple questions
[1901.16 → 1902.52] And then I will come to each of you
[1902.52 → 1904.72] For an answer together
[1904.72 → 1906.66] I encourage you to respond with
[1906.66 → 1907.22] We do
[1907.22 → 1908.80] God helping us
[1908.80 → 1912.02] Dan and Dismay
[1912.02 → 1913.78] Brandon and Savannah
[1913.78 → 1915.14] Dan and Rebecca
[1915.14 → 1918.34] Since you have presented your children for baptism
[1918.34 → 1919.70] We ask you the following questions
[1919.70 → 1920.36] Before God
[1920.36 → 1921.82] And before his people
[1921.82 → 1923.92] Do you believe
[1923.92 → 1924.96] That your children
[1924.96 → 1926.26] Though sinful by nature
[1926.26 → 1927.88] Are received by God
[1927.88 → 1928.72] In Christ
[1928.72 → 1930.04] As members of his covenant
[1930.04 → 1931.00] And therefore
[1931.00 → 1932.44] Ought to be baptized
[1932.44 → 1934.80] And do you promise
[1934.80 → 1936.52] In reliance on the Holy Spirit
[1936.52 → 1938.62] And with the help of this Christian community
[1938.62 → 1940.54] To do all in your power
[1940.54 → 1941.96] To instruct these girls
[1941.96 → 1943.40] And all your children
[1943.40 → 1945.16] In the Christian faith
[1945.16 → 1946.28] And to lead them
[1946.28 → 1947.36] By your example
[1947.36 → 1948.46] Into the life
[1948.46 → 1950.32] Of Christian discipleship
[1950.32 → 1952.12] Dan and Dismay
[1952.12 → 1953.08] What is your answer?
[1953.08 → 1957.16] Dan and Rebecca
[1957.16 → 1958.20] What is your answer?
[1961.46 → 1962.20] Brandon and SAV
[1962.20 → 1963.18] What is your answer?
[1965.40 → 1965.82] Amen
[1965.82 → 1968.86] Our Lord Jesus said
[1968.86 → 1969.84] Let the little children
[1969.84 → 1970.62] Come to me
[1970.62 → 1972.12] And do not hinder them
[1972.12 → 1973.64] For the kingdom of God

[2267.50 → 2270.08] In this way
[2270.08 → 2271.16] And with these words
[2271.16 → 2272.52] The Lord puts his name
[2272.52 → 2273.64] On our children
[2273.64 → 2274.76] And makes them

[2300.34 → 2300.76] Their own
[2300.76 → 2303.10] And we can celebrate

[2319.06 → 2322.58] I'm going to invite
[2322.58 → 2322.94] Ken
[2322.94 → 2324.10] To come to the front
[2324.10 → 2325.38] Ken is an elder here
[2325.38 → 2326.18] He's going to
[2326.18 → 2326.94] Give each of you
[2326.94 → 2327.64] A gift
[2327.64 → 2328.12] And then once
[2328.12 → 2328.90] Ken has given you
[2328.90 → 2329.28] Your gift
[2329.28 → 2330.50] You can return

[2334.94 → 2335.36] If you want

[2336.74 → 2337.74] And sing up at the front
[2337.74 → 2338.38] Because we're going to
[2338.38 → 2339.34] Do the blessing
[2339.34 → 2340.14] From up here
[2340.14 → 2341.86] In just a moment as well

[2471.06 → 2476.68] Jesus thought we were not stranger
[2476.68 → 2482.32] Wandering from the fold of God
[2482.32 → 2487.68] Be to rescue, be from danger
[2487.68 → 2493.06] Interpose His precious blood
[2493.06 → 2506.06] Oh, to grace how great a debtor
[2506.06 → 2512.06] Daily I'm not strained to fear
[2512.06 → 2517.68] Let Thy goodness, Thy love better

[2523.06 → 2528.82] Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it
[2528.82 → 2533.68] Prone to leave the God I love
[2533.68 → 2536.30] Here's my heart, Lord

[2687.10 → 2691.82] Seal it for the courts above
[2691.82 → 2713.48] Okay, as you are being seated, we're going to invite the kids back up to the front here for the kids' blessing.
[2713.48 → 2725.24] Now, if you're visiting with us this morning, what that means is we have kids come up to the front and those who are aged three to kindergarten are then invited to go out to children's worship time.
[2726.28 → 2730.96] We're going to let you decide if that means going into kindergarten or just having finished kindergarten.
[2731.14 → 2731.88] That's up to you.
[2731.88 → 2741.56] If you are visiting with us, and you didn't have a chance to sign your kids in to children's worship time, please, as a parent or guardian, go out with them and then Nikki will be back there.
[2741.66 → 2743.72] She will sign your children in.
[2743.98 → 2746.60] That way we can make sure you get the right kids back.
[2746.78 → 2750.58] And if you don't sign them in, you might take one of mine home so I can have the afternoon off.
[2752.62 → 2753.80] Oh, there it is.
[2754.60 → 2756.52] Eight going on 18, I roll.
[2757.12 → 2758.56] It's my job to embarrass you.
[2758.56 → 2764.10] Okay, guys, we're going to do the children's blessing after I pray for you.
[2764.16 → 2765.08] Do you remember how we do that?
[2766.12 → 2766.96] How do we do that?
[2766.98 → 2768.16] Because this is my first time leading it.
[2768.74 → 2770.02] We start with our hands like this.
[2770.82 → 2772.88] And then we say, the Lord be with you.
[2772.98 → 2774.72] And then they say something to us, right?
[2774.82 → 2775.68] Do we know what they say?
[2776.68 → 2777.82] What do they say, Ruby?
[2782.60 → 2783.84] And also with you.
[2783.92 → 2784.82] Okay, did you hear that?
[2785.68 → 2787.94] Ruby wants you to say, and also with you.
[2788.56 → 2791.14] All right, so I'm going to pray, and then I'm going to invite you all to stand.
[2791.20 → 2791.96] Let's pray together.
[2795.00 → 2802.02] Heavenly Father, as our younger members go out to worship, we pray that they would encounter you.
[2803.12 → 2804.96] Stir their love for you.
[2805.66 → 2811.36] May they see you in worship together, even as we here worship you.
[2811.36 → 2814.42] Go with us and with them in Jesus' name.
[2815.12 → 2815.34] Amen.
[2817.08 → 2818.44] All right, should we ask them all to stand?
[2819.22 → 2820.32] Say, please stand.
[2821.62 → 2821.94] Yeah.
[2823.62 → 2825.24] All right, so we face them, right?
[2826.68 → 2828.12] And then we say together,
[2829.42 → 2831.12] The Lord be with you.
[2832.18 → 2833.62] And also with you.
[2833.62 → 2834.46] Amen.
[2834.84 → 2839.46] All right, if you're going to go off to children's worship time, now is the time to do that.
[2839.76 → 2839.86] Okay.
[2843.66 → 2845.58] And then deacon.
[2845.72 → 2846.22] Thanks, Clem.
[2846.22 → 2867.32] Hello.
[2867.70 → 2868.44] Oh, there we go.
[2869.34 → 2870.14] Good morning, everyone.
[2870.14 → 2873.24] It is now time for our tithes and offerings.
[2873.24 → 2877.22] Good morning.
[2878.22 → 2884.68] The first offering today is for Langley Emanuel, its ministries and ongoing costs.
[2885.62 → 2893.62] The second offering is for NAME, North American Indigenous Ministries.
[2894.84 → 2897.92] NAME works with a culturally conscious approach,
[2897.92 → 2903.16] looking to find a more respectful way to help First Nations people.
[2906.36 → 2912.56] A greater number of NAME staff are First Nations Native believers.
[2913.90 → 2919.08] And NAME would like to see more Native Christians in ministry and leadership positions.
[2919.08 → 2926.84] Tim and Charity Johnson, whom we support directly as Project 627,
[2927.78 → 2930.24] are in the Shushed Nation Reserve.
[2931.20 → 2935.06] They consider the Native people their family and their community.
[2935.06 → 2941.64] Christ came as a servant to this world and invites us also to become servants.
[2942.94 → 2944.14] Interesting stat.
[2944.54 → 2950.28] Marginalized people are mentioned in the Bible over 3,000 times.
[2951.24 → 2952.84] And I didn't look them all up.
[2952.84 → 2959.12] Next week's second offering is for Night Shift.
[2959.78 → 2966.04] This is an outreach ministry in Surrey for people in poverty and those with addictions.
[2968.80 → 2975.42] The Bible verse today is from Hagar, chapter 10, verse 7 to 8.
[2975.80 → 2978.20] This is what the Lord Almighty says.
[2979.10 → 2981.34] Give careful thought to your ways.
[2981.34 → 2987.52] Go up into the mountains and bring down timber and build by house,
[2987.82 → 2992.00] so that I may take pleasure in it and be honoured.
[2998.28 → 3001.96] We're just doing one bag today, so everything goes in one bag.
[3002.38 → 3005.44] And you have to mark the budget separately.
[3011.34 → 3041.32] We're just doing one bag.
[3041.34 → 3042.14] Thank you.
[3042.14 → 3044.64] There's a lot of socialgliches over here.
[3044.64 → 3045.42] Very long snails are talking to the people trying to hit,
[3045.60 → 3046.46] so everything goes in one bag.
[3046.46 → 3047.72] Amazing blasphemies is Dinah, Avengers' mother,
[3047.72 → 3048.34] and that I might worship the family and family.
[3048.50 → 3050.82] We are all grateful for that.

[3140.88 → 3142.88] Amen.
[3142.88 → 3144.88] Amen.
[3144.88 → 3146.88] Good morning, everybody.
[3146.88 → 3150.88] I'm going to lead you all in congregational prayer.
[3150.88 → 3154.88] Before I do that, though, I was slipped a piece of paper.
[3154.88 → 3162.88] And I don't know if you guys have ever had this, so I'll, I don't know, talk to a buddy or whatever, and they'll be like, so-and-so had a baby.
[3162.88 → 3163.88] And then I'll be like, cool.
[3163.88 → 3165.88] So I'll say to my wife, so-and-so had a baby.
[3165.88 → 3167.88] And she'll say, well, what was the name?
[3167.88 → 3168.88] I don't know.
[3168.88 → 3170.88] And what did it weigh?
[3170.88 → 3171.88] I don't know.
[3171.88 → 3172.88] Was it a boy or a girl?
[3172.88 → 3173.88] I don't know.
[3173.88 → 3175.88] Anyway, so we have all the details.
[3175.88 → 3181.88] David and Sheila Skipper were blessed with a healthy baby boy on July 16th.
[3181.88 → 3184.88] His name is Dawson Arthur.
[3184.88 → 3187.88] Four pounds, nine ounces.
[3187.88 → 3190.88] Mother and baby are still in hospital, but are doing well.
[3190.88 → 3193.88] So, there we go.
[3193.88 → 3199.88] Yeah, may I lead you in prayer.
[3199.88 → 3209.88] Merciful God and Heavenly Father, praise be to your holy name, the God of heaven and earth, the God of the Bible, Yahweh.
[3209.88 → 3212.88] Father, we thank you for allowing us to come here.
[3212.88 → 3217.88] And thank you that all the restrictions have been lifted from us gathering together to worship you.
[3217.88 → 3224.88] Today is a day set aside to worship you, to come together as your people and be fed with your spirit.
[3224.88 → 3228.88] Father, we bring before you our sins, our imperfections.
[3228.88 → 3230.88] These things can weigh us down.
[3230.88 → 3235.88] They can make us feel trapped, perhaps unworthy or just simply lost.
[3235.88 → 3242.88] It can never be said enough or spoken enough about the gift of Jesus Christ to take away the sins of the world.
[3242.88 → 3250.88] And so, Father, we call upon you to forgive us through your Son, Jesus Christ, and allow us to live in the joy and freedom of forgiveness.
[3250.88 → 3260.88] We also bring before you our hurts and our pains, the things that we suffer in this life, and the struggles that we can experience day to day.
[3260.88 → 3264.88] We pray for Joanne and Willie Miles.
[3264.88 → 3266.88] Last week, they lost their son, Mike.
[3266.88 → 3270.88] And we know that this is a particularly difficult thing.
[3270.88 → 3274.88] Every parent's worst fear is to lose a child.
[3274.88 → 3278.88] And for some, that is a reality.
[3278.88 → 3287.88] Father, for them and for everyone who has ever lost a child, we pray for your peace to sustain all of them,
[3287.88 → 3291.88] and especially Joanne and Willie Miles' family during this time.
[3291.88 → 3295.88] We also pray that you watch over Willie in his physical health as well.
[3295.88 → 3299.88] We thank you that he is home from the hospital after suffering a collapsed lung,
[3299.88 → 3303.88] and we ask for healing and strength as he recovers.
[3303.88 → 3308.88] We pray for Benita Smith, who suffered a relatively minor heart attack this past Tuesday.
[3308.88 → 3314.88] We pray for the doctors and nurses who care for her, and we pray that you will grant her a full recovery.
[3314.88 → 3319.88] We pray for those who have experienced health issues due to the extreme heat we've been having.
[3319.88 → 3324.88] Watch over the elderly and those vulnerable to these types of situations.
[3324.88 → 3331.88] We ask you to continue to be near all those who are shut in and can't make it out to the worship services.
[3331.88 → 3337.88] May we as a church family reach out to those people so they can experience the love of Christ through us.
[3337.88 → 3341.88] We pray for all those who are being affected by the fires burning in our province.
[3341.88 → 3344.88] Be with all the men and women who are fighting these fires.
[3344.88 → 3349.88] And we also pray for some rain that will help put the fires out.
[3349.88 → 3354.88] Father, while there is much hurt and suffering, we can also experience much joy.
[3354.88 → 3359.88] And so we are thankful to you for all the good and wonderful things that you allow us to experience.
[3359.88 → 3364.88] We give thanks with Daniel and Dismay Howling, Brandon and Savannah Muller, and Dan and Rebecca Pullman,
[3364.88 → 3368.88] as their daughters Daphne, Hayden, and Esther have been baptized here this morning.
[3368.88 → 3375.88] We pray for these families and for our church family as we promise to encourage and support them as they raise their children,
[3375.88 → 3378.88] teaching them to love and serve you.
[3378.88 → 3381.88] Father, be with all the families in our church.
[3381.88 → 3384.88] Keep our marriages strong. Keep our parents diligent.
[3384.88 → 3388.88] Being in a marriage, being parents, it takes a lot of work and effort.
[3388.88 → 3393.88] And may we constantly be in prayer seeking strength, help, and wisdom from you in all these things.
[3393.88 → 3397.88] We continue to pray, and also thank you for this church here in the church.
[3397.88 → 3402.88] We thank you for this church here in Durbanville, for all the people who contribute faithfully to its operation,
[3402.88 → 3407.88] for all the employees and volunteers on all kinds of committees and groups.
[3407.88 → 3413.88] It takes a lot of people to run this church, and we thank you for them and for your faithfulness to us.
[3413.88 → 3420.88] Father, continue to be with us in this day and strengthen your servant Chris as he brings us your word.
[3420.88 → 3425.88] May we all experience your nearness and faithfulness to us through your word.
[3425.88 → 3428.88] We pray all these things in Jesus name. Amen.
[3428.88 → 3429.88] Amen.
[3429.88 → 3447.88] See that ladies and gentlemen Kevin's theatre degree at work.
[3447.88 → 3452.88] See that ladies and gentlemen Kevin's theatre degree at work.
[3452.88 → 3456.88] He complains about never having to use it.
[3456.88 → 3466.88] In case you've missed it or if this is the first time that you are checking us out this summer,
[3466.88 → 3470.88] we are answering your questions.
[3470.88 → 3475.88] Last month we asked you to submit a bunch of questions and then in July and August,
[3475.88 → 3479.88] we as pastors and leaders here are answering them together.
[3479.88 → 3487.88] If you get the e-bulletin from our church, you can see the list of questions and the dates that we will be addressing them.
[3487.88 → 3494.88] So you can be sure not to miss your question or our answers to the things that are burning holes in your minds
[3494.88 → 3497.88] or that you're hungry to figure out together.
[3497.88 → 3507.88] And just a reminder, the best way to engage this stuff and this time together each week is to keep it going at home, right?
[3507.88 → 3510.88] Or in your care group or in your Bible study group.
[3510.88 → 3512.88] Ask each other these questions.
[3512.88 → 3516.88] Ask each other how you would answer these questions.
[3516.88 → 3522.88] Now this week's question, I think, is really, really great.
[3522.88 → 3529.88] The question is, is the cultural mandate to fill the earth and subdue it still applicable?
[3529.88 → 3535.88] The question, when it was given to us, had a little tag appended to it saying,
[3535.88 → 3542.88] climate change activists say this passage encourages development and destruction of habitat and shrinking glaciers
[3542.88 → 3544.88] and super hot temperatures.
[3544.88 → 3547.88] And on and on it goes.
[3547.88 → 3551.88] Now off the top, let me say that I love this question.
[3551.88 → 3555.88] I love it because it's not simple, and it has layers.
[3555.88 → 3560.88] And I love it because for some of you, hearing me ask that question is already a trap.
[3560.88 → 3563.88] And some of you are already triggered because of the language that I used.
[3563.88 → 3567.88] And I'll be honest, I don't mind stirring the pot now and again.
[3567.88 → 3572.88] It's a question that has the potential to divide and to polarize.
[3572.88 → 3577.88] Now I love this question also because the irony of asking and answering this question on a Sunday
[3577.88 → 3581.88] where we just baptized three new baby girls is not lost on me.
[3581.88 → 3585.88] Right? We are celebrating having babies.
[3585.88 → 3592.88] On a day when we are asking about, is it still wise to have babies?
[3592.88 → 3601.88] Now all of that together, I love this question because we can address it showing a better way.
[3601.88 → 3607.88] Right? We can address it showing a way that refuses to be pigeonholed into simple categories
[3607.88 → 3613.88] or a way that enters into the difficulty of this kind of conversation with integrity.
[3613.88 → 3617.88] Without compromising core values or biblical truths.
[3617.88 → 3622.88] All the while allowing for a range of applications of the answer.
[3622.88 → 3627.88] And so, before I really even begin, I want you to hear that.
[3627.88 → 3632.88] Right? There is a range of applications to the answer that I am going to give.
[3632.88 → 3637.88] But I think there is a particularly narrow answer.
[3637.88 → 3641.88] What I mean by that is I think that the answer that I give is compelling
[3641.88 → 3643.88] and it is based on good biblical theology.
[3643.88 → 3648.88] But how you then work it out in your life, that's where the diversity really will be.
[3648.88 → 3652.88] And that's good. That's okay.
[3652.88 → 3657.88] In fact, that's probably best for us here together.
[3657.88 → 3663.88] Right? We can go from here to have more conversations and asking more questions.
[3663.88 → 3666.88] And I love that about this too.
[3666.88 → 3668.88] And so, let's dig in.
[3668.88 → 3672.88] We're going to bounce around the Bible, but the first place we're going to go is Genesis 1.
[3672.88 → 3676.88] And so, if you have a Bible and you want that handy, you can open it up.
[3676.88 → 3679.88] Genesis 1. Genesis is the very first book of the Bible.
[3679.88 → 3682.88] It's the easiest book to find when you don't have it on the screen.
[3682.88 → 3689.88] If you don't have a Bible in your hand, find one on your phone or there's a few at the back that you can grab.
[3689.88 → 3696.88] Now, is the cultural mandate still applicable to us as Christians?
[3696.88 → 3700.88] Now, the first thing we have to address in answering that question is,
[3700.88 → 3705.88] what on earth or in heaven, as the case may be, is the cultural mandate?
[3705.88 → 3713.88] Now, the cultural mandate is what we call the commission that God gave Adam and Eve in the garden.
[3713.88 → 3718.88] Right? In Genesis 1, you can read it.
[3718.88 → 3721.88] We'll start at verse 27.
[3721.88 → 3726.88] Genesis 1, verse 27.
[3726.88 → 3731.88] So, God created mankind in his own image.
[3731.88 → 3735.88] In the image of God, he created them. Male and female, he created them.
[3735.88 → 3737.88] God blessed them and said to them,
[3737.88 → 3741.88] Be fruitful and increase in number.
[3741.88 → 3743.88] Fill the earth and subdue it.
[3743.88 → 3746.88] Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds of the air
[3746.88 → 3750.88] and over every living creature that moves on the ground.
[3750.88 → 3766.88] This is the cultural mandate.
[3766.88 → 3772.88] Be fruitful. Multiply. Fill the earth. Subdue it. Rule over it.
[3772.88 → 3778.88] The old language there that you might be familiar with is to exercise dominion.
[3778.88 → 3781.88] That's the cultural mandate.
[3781.88 → 3790.88] Humans are commissioned by God to grow and spread and develop and learn and explore and craft and create.
[3790.88 → 3798.88] Right? As God created order out of chaos, so too are we to explore the order and make sense of the chaos.
[3798.88 → 3803.88] As God created, so too are we to procreate and recreate. Right?
[3803.88 → 3806.88] To have kids and to have fun.
[3806.88 → 3810.88] The cultural mandate is about families, and it's about fun.
[3810.88 → 3815.88] It's about art and culture. It's about musing and painting and theatre and poetry.
[3815.88 → 3817.88] It's about science and exploring.
[3817.88 → 3823.88] It's about microbiology and quantum mechanics and astronomy and theoretical physics.
[3823.88 → 3826.88] God creates, and then he says,
[3826.88 → 3834.88] Go and learn. Go into all the world and see all that I have made for you and done for you.
[3834.88 → 3837.88] That's the cultural mandate.
[3837.88 → 3846.88] But now, what about when there's 7.9 billion people in the world?
[3846.88 → 3853.88] Estimates say by the end of 2025 we will cross that 8 billion threshold.
[3853.88 → 3858.88] This is a finite planet with finite resources.
[3858.88 → 3862.88] How does that change our understanding of the cultural mandate?
[3862.88 → 3867.88] The question that was asked of us, right, makes specific reference to climate change.
[3867.88 → 3870.88] And like I said, I get that for some of you that's a trigger.
[3870.88 → 3876.88] But the reality of course is that the climate is changing.
[3876.88 → 3878.88] That's demonstrable.
[3878.88 → 3885.88] Now, how much is human caused, or how much is singularly human responsibility?
[3885.88 → 3891.88] Are there large scale cyclical patterns or do we have 10 years or 30 years or more?
[3891.88 → 3896.88] Will one degree of rise be what brings the catastrophe, or will it take two degrees of rise?
[3896.88 → 3897.88] Right?
[3897.88 → 3901.88] As some are saying, you can have all sorts of opinions on that.
[3901.88 → 3906.88] And I'm happy to talk about that and the opinions on that with anybody later.
[3906.88 → 3910.88] But we can say the climate is changing.
[3910.88 → 3915.88] And we can say that humans have a responsibility in the face of that.
[3915.88 → 3917.88] In fact, I'm going to return to this more at the end.
[3917.88 → 3923.88] But it is the cultural mandate itself that tells us we have a responsibility in the face of all of that.
[3923.88 → 3926.88] And so let me be really, really clear.
[3926.88 → 3933.88] What you think about climate change doesn't ultimately matter for how Christians live responsibly in the world today, together,
[3933.88 → 3936.88] and in the face of challenges that our species will face.
[3936.88 → 3940.88] But I'm getting ahead of myself, so hang on to that idea.
[3940.88 → 3941.88] We'll come back to it.
[3941.88 → 3948.88] Because you see, there is a cultural conversation and reality that is at work here.
[3948.88 → 3953.88] People are asking questions about climate change and family size.
[3953.88 → 3960.88] People are asking questions about global population levels and individual responsibilities in the face of that.
[3960.88 → 3965.88] The fact that this question was asked here isn't actually strange, and it's not an anomaly.
[3965.88 → 3968.88] It's part of the cultural discourse right now.
[3968.88 → 3971.88] Let me make that point quickly.
[3971.88 → 3976.88] There was an article written in Vox.com in 2019 that was called,
[3976.88 → 3980.88] We Need to Talk About the Ethics of Having Children in a Warming World.
[3980.88 → 3989.88] Now that article quotes AOC Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who's a Democratic representative for New York State in the U.S.
[3989.88 → 3992.88] She's a bit of a pop culture celebrity.
[3992.88 → 3995.88] Social media friends with Meet Singh, for any of you who are interested in all of that.
[3995.88 → 3997.88] She's quoted in that article to say,
[3997.88 → 4002.88] Basically, there is scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult.
[4002.88 → 4006.88] And it does lead, I think, young people to have a legitimate question.
[4006.88 → 4009.88] Is it okay to still have children?
[4009.88 → 4010.88] End quote.
[4010.88 → 4018.88] Similarly, in Vogue magazine, back in April of this year now, has an article titled,
[4018.88 → 4022.88] Is Having a Baby in 2021 Pure Environmental Vandalism?
[4022.88 → 4026.88] Now, regardless of your opinions on the matter, that's just good headline writing.
[4026.88 → 4031.88] And to be clear, right, it's not just pop culture.
[4031.88 → 4034.88] It's not just Vox.com or Vogue magazine.
[4034.88 → 4040.88] In an article for Science Daily, with materials from the University of Arizona,
[4040.88 → 4044.88] Alexis Blue asked, and this was written just a month ago,
[4044.88 → 4048.88] Why is climate change driving some to skip having kids?
[4048.88 → 4049.88] Right?
[4049.88 → 4053.88] And there's a study behind that material that was published in March 2021
[4053.88 → 4056.88] in the peer-reviewed journal, Population and Environment.
[4056.88 → 4057.88] Right?
[4057.88 → 4060.88] And that study titled, again, good writing, rather pithily, titled,
[4060.88 → 4064.88] No Future, No Kids, No Kids, No Future.
[4064.88 → 4070.88] But that study identified three reasons why people are holding off on having kids right now.
[4070.88 → 4075.88] Now, that was named as overconsumption, and that's the problem of limited resources, right?
[4075.88 → 4077.88] Food and water, right?
[4077.88 → 4082.88] The problem of overpopulation, and the problem of an uncertain future, right?
[4082.88 → 4088.88] The people surveyed and studied, and the reflections given here say, quote,
[4088.88 → 4093.88] There's a sense of doom about the future if climate change continues unchecked,
[4093.88 → 4097.88] and they wondered if they were doing something morally and ethically wrong
[4097.88 → 4101.88] if they brought a child into the world with such an uncertain future.
[4101.88 → 4108.88] So we have pop culture, we have sociological studies and psychological studies, and we have philosophers.
[4108.88 → 4113.88] There is a philosopher by the name of Thomas Reader who's from the Berman Institute of Bioethics
[4113.88 → 4121.88] at the prestigious Johns Hopkins University, and he is a proponent of what he calls small family ethics.
[4121.88 → 4124.88] He says, quote,
[4124.88 → 4126.88] Here's a provocative thought.
[4126.88 → 4129.88] Maybe we should protect our kids by not having them.
[4130.88 → 4132.88] End quote.
[4132.88 → 4139.88] He goes on to argue that we can bring down the global fertility rate by even half a child on average.
[4139.88 → 4140.88] Okay?
[4140.88 → 4141.88] Numbers.
[4141.88 → 4142.88] We're having children here.
[4142.88 → 4144.88] Or halting children.
[4144.88 → 4147.88] By just a half a child, that could save us, he says.
[4147.88 → 4148.88] Right?
[4148.88 → 4151.88] To non-profits and social agencies.
[4151.88 → 4157.88] Megan Kerman and Josephine Farrell are founders of a non-profit called Conceivable Future.
[4157.88 → 4163.88] Their point of view is that the climate crisis is a, quote, reproductive crisis.
[4163.88 → 4172.88] And so all across the board, right, from the popular level in Vox.com to the academic peer-reviewed level to the philosophical level,
[4172.88 → 4174.88] people are asking this question.
[4176.88 → 4180.88] To be really honest, it's a question that I asked myself.
[4181.88 → 4184.88] And that I wrestled with Rachel when we were going to have kids.
[4185.88 → 4186.88] Right?
[4186.88 → 4188.88] I know this isn't just an out there question.
[4188.88 → 4189.88] It's an in here question.
[4189.88 → 4192.88] And I know that because it was an in here question.
[4195.88 → 4196.88] And so it's worth asking.
[4198.88 → 4199.88] And it's worth digging deep into.
[4201.88 → 4208.88] Now before we dig too deeply, let me just give you a principle about decision-making in the world.
[4209.88 → 4215.88] And family planning in an age of climate change, in an age of increasing scarcity and rising global population populations,
[4215.88 → 4218.88] is one of those decisions that you may have to make.
[4220.88 → 4225.88] As a rule, we don't make decisions based on fear.
[4226.88 → 4230.88] Christians aren't a people who react in fear.
[4231.88 → 4233.88] Like the author of Hebrews says,
[4234.88 → 4239.88] We do not belong to those who shrink back and are destroyed, but to those who have faith and are saved.
[4239.88 → 4243.88] And this is how the psalmist puts it in Psalm 46.
[4244.88 → 4245.88] He writes,
[4245.88 → 4252.88] We will not fear.
[4252.88 → 4253.88] Fear.
[4253.88 → 4254.88] This is an interactive portion, okay?
[4254.88 → 4255.88] I need you to get in here.
[4255.88 → 4256.88] We will not fear.
[4256.88 → 4261.88] Though the earth give way, though mountains fall into the heart of the sea,
[4261.88 → 4264.88] though waters roar and foam, though the mountains quake with their surging,
[4265.88 → 4267.88] we will not fear.
[4268.88 → 4271.88] Even when sea levels rise, even when wildfires abound,
[4272.88 → 4276.88] even when drought happens and famine comes, we will not fear.
[4276.88 → 4281.88] There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out fear.
[4282.88 → 4284.88] We know the love of God.
[4285.88 → 4290.88] We know the God who loves, and the God who loves is the same as the God who created.
[4290.88 → 4295.88] The God who loves is the God who is guiding all history to his glorious ends.
[4295.88 → 4302.88] For in him, Colossians says, all things were created, things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible,
[4302.88 → 4308.88] whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities, all things have been created through him and for him.
[4308.88 → 4313.88] He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.
[4314.88 → 4316.88] Job cries out to God at the end of his long story,
[4316.88 → 4322.88] I know that you can do all things that no purpose of yours can be thwarted.
[4323.88 → 4328.88] We are not afraid, and we don't make decisions based on fear.
[4331.88 → 4332.88] Someone should have said amen there.
[4333.88 → 4337.88] Even if you struggle to believe that, preach it to yourself.
[4338.88 → 4340.88] We are not afraid. Be strong and courageous.
[4341.88 → 4343.88] Do not be afraid. Do not be discouraged.
[4343.88 → 4346.88] The Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.
[4346.88 → 4349.88] We are not afraid, and we don't make decisions based on fear.
[4350.88 → 4352.88] But let me be really, really, really clear.
[4354.88 → 4360.88] Not making decisions based on fear means we have to make them on something else.
[4361.88 → 4363.88] Because we have to do something.
[4364.88 → 4365.88] We can't just sit on the fence.
[4366.88 → 4367.88] We have to make a decision.
[4367.88 → 4374.88] What I want to say is that we make decisions based on faith in God and his word,
[4374.88 → 4378.88] and based on the wisdom that he has given us.
[4379.88 → 4382.88] Not fear, but faith and wisdom.
[4383.88 → 4389.88] And you see, it is both faith and wisdom that calls us to action here.
[4389.88 → 4393.88] In the face of climate realities, however you define them,
[4393.88 → 4396.88] in the face of creation groaning, to use the language of the Bible,
[4396.88 → 4399.88] faith and wisdom demand something from us.
[4399.88 → 4401.88] You don't get to sit on the fence here.
[4402.88 → 4405.88] You get to instead be stewards of what God has given us.
[4406.88 → 4407.88] Right?
[4407.88 → 4408.88] You see it now, or we're beginning to.
[4408.88 → 4409.88] We're beginning to.
[4409.88 → 4414.88] That's why I said that it actually doesn't matter what your opinion on climate change
[4414.88 → 4416.88] or population level rise is.
[4417.88 → 4420.88] What matters is that God has called you,
[4420.88 → 4424.88] that God has commissioned you with the responsibility in the world
[4425.88 → 4429.88] to care for it, to develop it, to manage it, and to direct it, and to steward it,
[4429.88 → 4431.88] because it belongs to him.
[4432.88 → 4435.88] He doesn't want you to live in fear of the unknown,
[4435.88 → 4441.88] and he doesn't want you to sit idle by while human greed and pride make a mess of his very good world.
[4442.88 → 4446.88] Our world belongs to God, and it is groaning under the weight of sin.
[4447.88 → 4453.88] And Christians and the church are supposed to be the place and the people
[4454.88 → 4458.88] where the power of sin, while still present in our lives, doesn't rule our lives,
[4459.88 → 4460.88] doesn't define who we are.
[4461.88 → 4464.88] Right? Pride isn't our principal force, but humility.
[4465.88 → 4468.88] Greed doesn't define us, but grace.
[4468.88 → 4473.88] You are created by God to share in his rule over the world.
[4474.88 → 4477.88] You are created by God to subdue this world.
[4477.88 → 4480.88] And that means we wrestle order out of chaos.
[4480.88 → 4484.88] That means we push back against the darkness by bringing in the light.
[4484.88 → 4490.88] That means we strive in stewardship to shape the world in line with God's creational design.
[4490.88 → 4496.88] Even as we battle against powers and principalities and the rulers of this world.
[4497.88 → 4500.88] Right? You see, the cultural mandate isn't the problem.
[4501.88 → 4505.88] The cultural mandate is actually the solution to the problem.
[4506.88 → 4511.88] Right? We need a generation of Christians who take up the call to be fruitful
[4511.88 → 4516.88] and who take up the responsibility to subdue the disordered world seriously.
[4516.88 → 4522.88] Right? This is actually a call for Christian scientists to be the solution to the climate problem.
[4522.88 → 4527.88] Right? We need to be a generation of Christians who tackle the problem of population,
[4527.88 → 4532.88] of wildfires, of drought, or famine with faith and wisdom.
[4534.88 → 4541.88] Responding to God's call on their lives, maybe it will be one of these three girls who we baptized this morning,
[4541.88 → 4546.88] who will become the scientist or the engineer or the artist or the creative who will change the world.
[4546.88 → 4552.88] The cultural mandate requires us to be a people of faith and wisdom,
[4552.88 → 4558.88] pursuing God's goodness and his good creation and his design.
[4558.88 → 4563.88] Right? Far from being a license to use and abuse the creation,
[4563.88 → 4568.88] Genesis 1 verse 28, the cultural mandate is our call, our commission,
[4568.88 → 4574.88] to care for the world as God intended and as he calls us to do.
[4576.88 → 4586.88] And so, we have families because strong, healthy Christian families are the foundation of a good society.
[4586.88 → 4592.88] We have families because protecting the future matters and without kids there is no future.
[4592.88 → 4602.88] And look, most of you know this already, but we need to hear it again.
[4602.88 → 4610.88] For God so loved the world, the world that he gave his one and only son,
[4610.88 → 4614.88] that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
[4614.88 → 4616.88] Right? Did you hear that? God loves the world.
[4616.88 → 4620.88] He loves the world, this world, and not just the people in it.
[4620.88 → 4624.88] Sometimes we like to make it smaller than it actually is, but the planet and the cosmos.
[4624.88 → 4630.88] He loves the world so much that he became a part of it, that the transcendent God became imminent,
[4630.88 → 4636.88] that the infinite became finite, that the spiritual took on flesh.
[4636.88 → 4641.88] Jesus came and lived the life I should have lived and died the death that I deserve.
[4641.88 → 4644.88] And because he was raised three days later, he has won the victory.
[4644.88 → 4646.88] He has paid the price.
[4646.88 → 4651.88] He has wrestled the world back from sin and Satan, and it belongs to him.
[4651.88 → 4655.88] He rules o'er all the earth.
[4655.88 → 4657.88] One more time. Amen?
[4657.88 → 4661.88] And we live in his rule.
[4661.88 → 4664.88] We live out of his reign.
[4664.88 → 4669.88] We live obedient to him, and we live for him.
[4669.88 → 4671.88] Right?
[4671.88 → 4675.88] The truth of the matter is this.
[4675.88 → 4678.88] There is a challenge in front of us.
[4678.88 → 4683.88] And it doesn't matter whether we or you or who caused it.
[4683.88 → 4686.88] It matters that we are called to address it.
[4686.88 → 4688.88] That's up to us.
[4688.88 → 4690.88] That's up to you.
[4690.88 → 4697.88] And like I said before, how you address it is your work of application.
[4697.88 → 4705.88] That we respond is exactly what the cultural mandate was given us to ensure.
[4705.88 → 4710.88] And so, go and respond.
[4711.88 → 4715.88] Go and do something.
[4715.88 → 4716.88] Amen?
[4716.88 → 4717.88] Let's pray together.
[4717.88 → 4718.88] Let's pray together.
[4725.88 → 4731.88] Holy God, send us out in the power of your name.
[4731.88 → 4736.88] Send us out with the conviction of your commissioning.
[4736.88 → 4739.88] To go and do.
[4739.88 → 4741.88] To go and subdue.
[4741.88 → 4745.88] To go and create and be creative.
[4745.88 → 4747.88] To go and develop and discern.
[4747.88 → 4752.88] To go and grow in our knowledge of you and of the world.
[4752.88 → 4760.88] Go that we might go in the power of your spirit as your agents of change in the world.
[4760.88 → 4775.88] Raise us up to be a generation of Christians who respond with integrity and intentionality to the call that you have placed on our lives.
[4775.88 → 4778.88] In Jesus' name we pray.
[4778.88 → 4779.88] Amen.
[4779.88 → 4780.88] Amen.
[4782.88 → 4784.88] Piano B therefore not begin.
[4784.88 → 4802.88] Piano B 봐オマエ suit
[4802.88 → 4814.22] My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' good and righteousness.
[4815.80 → 4828.22] I dare not trust the sweetest praise, but only trust in Jesus' name.
[4828.22 → 4842.22] My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[4844.70 → 4855.22] I dare not trust the sweetest praise, but only trust in Jesus' name.
[4858.22 → 4867.56] Christ alone, Lord as Lord, weak may strong.
[4867.80 → 4874.22] In the Saviour's love through the storm.
[4874.68 → 4881.22] He is Lord, Lord of all.
[4881.22 → 4897.22] When darkness seems to hide His face, I rest on His unchanging grace.
[4897.22 → 4909.22] In every heart and stormy death, my anger holds for him to bear.
[4909.22 → 4917.22] My anger holds for him to bear.
[4917.22 → 4927.22] When the Lord, Lord of all, weak may strong.
[4927.22 → 4934.36] In the Saviour's love through the storm.
[4934.36 → 4941.06] He is Lord, Lord of all.
[4941.06 → 4951.06] When He shall come with trumpet sound.
[4951.06 → 4958.06] Obey our land in Him, be found.
[4958.06 → 4964.06] Dressed in His righteousness alone.
[4964.06 → 4971.06] God will stand before the storm.
[4971.06 → 4973.06] God will stand before the storm.
[4973.06 → 4979.06] Christ alone, Father's stone.
[4979.06 → 4985.06] Weak may strong in the Saviour's love.
[4985.06 → 4986.06] Through the storm.
[4986.06 → 4988.06] Through the storm.
[4988.06 → 4992.06] He is Lord, Lord of all.
[4992.06 → 4993.06] Lord of all.
[4993.06 → 4998.06] Lord of all.
[4998.06 → 4999.06] Lord of all.
[4999.06 → 5001.06] Corner alone.
[5001.06 → 5002.06] Cornerstone.
[5002.06 → 5003.06] Cornerstone.
[5003.06 → 5004.06] Weak may strong.
[5004.06 → 5007.06] In the Saviour's love.
[5007.06 → 5008.06] Through the storm.
[5008.06 → 5022.30] In the Saviour's love, through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all.
[5022.30 → 5040.32] As you go into this week, know that God Himself goes with you, and that you go not alone,
[5040.44 → 5044.84] but in the power of the Spirit and in the fellowship of the saints.
[5044.84 → 5048.70] These gathered here and the church throughout time and space.
[5048.70 → 5055.62] Go with God's blessing, but also today, go with an invitation to stick around for fellowship afterwards.
[5055.84 → 5061.56] Go with an invitation to congratulate the Howling and the Pullmans and the Mullers.
[5062.06 → 5064.62] Go with an invitation, maybe even to coffee.
[5064.74 → 5068.00] I didn't check beforehand if that was done, but John, did we get coffee?
[5068.16 → 5069.58] Thumbs up, so far so good.
[5070.64 → 5071.16] Awesome.
[5071.76 → 5073.92] Receive the blessing of our God.
[5073.92 → 5079.48] May God go before you to prepare a way for you.
[5080.06 → 5082.80] May God go behind you to guard you.
[5083.82 → 5086.62] May God go beneath you to support you.
[5087.16 → 5089.46] May God go beside you to befriend you.
[5089.80 → 5092.12] Do not be afraid.
[5092.78 → 5094.80] Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[5094.94 → 5101.46] Do not be afraid, but go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
[5101.46 → 5102.34] Amen.
[5102.34 → 5104.40] All God's people said, Amen.
[5131.46 → 5138.08] Lord bless you and keep you.
[5138.84 → 5142.08] Make his face shine upon you.
[5142.50 → 5150.72] Be gracious to the turn of his face toward you.
[5150.72 → 5156.82] And give you peace.
[5156.82 → 5166.58] Lord bless you and keep you.
[5167.38 → 5170.70] Make his face shine upon you.
[5170.70 → 5179.56] Be gracious to the turn of his face toward you.
[5180.26 → 5185.76] And give you peace.
[5186.82 → 5191.20] Amen.
[5211.42 → 5211.64] Amen.
[5211.64 → 5221.54] To the Lord and keep you
[5221.54 → 5225.76] Make His face shine upon you
[5225.76 → 5228.64] Be gracious to you
[5228.64 → 5234.86] Lord, turn His face for you
[5234.86 → 5240.96] And give you peace
[5240.96 → 5255.10] Amen, amen, amen
[5255.10 → 5267.82] Amen, amen, amen
[5270.96 → 5286.96] May His favour be upon you
[5286.96 → 5289.86] And a thousand generations
[5289.86 → 5293.34] And your family and your children
[5293.34 → 5296.54] And their children and their children
[5296.54 → 5300.18] May His favour be upon you
[5300.18 → 5303.12] For a thousand generations
[5303.12 → 5305.96] And your family and your children
[5305.96 → 5308.86] And their children and their children
[5308.86 → 5313.18] And His presence goes before you
[5313.18 → 5314.76] And behind you
[5314.76 → 5316.40] And beside you
[5316.40 → 5317.96] And around you
[5317.96 → 5319.48] And between you
[5319.48 → 5321.10] He is with you
[5321.10 → 5322.74] He is with you
[5322.74 → 5324.06] In the morning
[5324.06 → 5325.68] In the evening
[5325.68 → 5327.22] In your coming
[5327.22 → 5328.82] And you're going
[5328.82 → 5329.96] In your weakness
[5330.48 → 5332.28] And rejoicing
[5332.28 → 5333.28] He is for you
[5333.28 → 5335.28] He is for you
[5335.28 → 5337.18] He is for you
[5337.18 → 5338.66] He is for you
[5338.66 → 5344.28] Amen, amen, amen
[5344.28 → 5350.28] Amen, amen
[5350.28 → 5370.66] Amen, amen, amen, amen
[5370.66 → 5371.68] Amen.
[5395.46 → 5397.26] Amen.
[5400.66 → 5401.66] Amen.
[5430.66 → 5431.66] Amen.
[5460.66 → 5461.66] Amen.
[5490.66 → 5491.66] Amen.
