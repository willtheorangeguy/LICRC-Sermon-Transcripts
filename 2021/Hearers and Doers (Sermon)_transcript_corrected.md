[0.00 → 5.94] I bet you some of you thought that little care groups plug was going to be my sermon today,
[6.04 → 11.64] but it's not. There's more. So thank you for joining us as we open up the word today.
[11.92 → 17.42] When I was four years old or so, I went to the bank with my dad. It was in Edmonton,
[17.42 → 21.92] and it was in the middle of the winter. Now, I don't remember how cold it was,
[22.38 → 27.82] but Edmonton in the wintertime is not the French Riviera. It was cold enough that my dad,
[27.82 → 32.40] as wise as he is, he wanted to make sure that I didn't do anything dumb.
[33.36 → 36.56] And so we got out of the car, and my dad grabbed my shoulders, and he looked me in the eye. He's like,
[36.60 → 44.22] Kevin, don't lick the poles. Now, looking back, I understand how good this advice was.
[44.38 → 50.30] At the time, though, that stop sign post sure looked like a cream soda-flavoured Icy Pop.
[51.28 → 54.88] And now I was motivated by the urge to lick something, and I thought, well,
[54.88 → 61.38] what's the worst that could happen? So my dad turned his back. Now, sometimes hearing something
[61.38 → 69.24] isn't enough. We need to respond. So it turns out, in what I can only assume was negative 45-degree
[69.24 → 76.04] weather, your tongue sticks to posts faster than you can say, Dad, watch this. I instantly regretted it,
[76.46 → 82.10] and I should have listened. Well, my dad, as heroic as he is, he said, Son, I'm going to run inside
[82.10 → 87.06] that building. I'll be gone for a second. I'm going to get some water. Don't move. I'll be right back.
[87.40 → 94.00] Your tongue will come off that post. Don't move. Now, again, in the midst of a crisis, it's amazing
[94.00 → 100.46] what you hear and what is actually said. Now, somehow, my dad saying, don't move. I'll be right
[100.46 → 106.22] back. You're going to be okay. It must have sounded like, son, rip your tongue off that pole. Do it with
[106.22 → 112.20] vigour. Don't let the taste of blood stop you. And so I pulled, and I twisted, and I ripped,
[112.60 → 118.04] and off my tongue came. Well, most of it anyway. About three centimetres got left behind.
[119.44 → 127.34] My tongue is still a little shorter to this day. The point is, we can hear. We can maybe even
[127.34 → 135.66] understand. But if we don't respond, it really doesn't do us any good. Today, we're continuing
[135.66 → 142.62] our sermon series through James, and today's text is about responding. Now, not only will we hear today
[142.62 → 147.96] our monthly memory verse, which is exciting, we're also going to hear the name of this sermon series.
[148.32 → 154.56] So we're going to look at the last section of this first chapter of James, so the final nine verses
[154.56 → 159.32] of James 1. So please, at home, here today as well, pull out your Bibles, pull out your notebooks,
[159.50 → 166.54] your pens, anything else that you need to nestle into this text and read along with me. James 1,
[167.04 → 176.00] 19 to 27, reads like this. My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this. Everyone should be quick
[176.00 → 184.28] to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry, because human anger does not produce the righteousness
[184.28 → 192.08] that God desires. Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent,
[192.68 → 200.52] and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you. Do not merely listen to the word,
[200.60 → 206.16] and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says
[206.16 → 212.78] is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror, and after looking at himself, goes away,
[212.78 → 219.30] and immediately forgets what he looks like. But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that
[219.30 → 225.22] gives freedom and continues in it, not forgetting what they've heard but doing it, they will be
[225.22 → 231.24] blessed in what they do. Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight
[231.24 → 238.66] rein on their tongue deceives themselves, and their religion is worthless. Religion that God our Father
[238.66 → 247.24] accepts as pure and faultless is this, to look after orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep
[247.24 → 257.10] oneself from being polluted from this world. The word of God today. Now like Pastor Chris said
[257.10 → 263.58] throughout this series, he said this numerous times, James can sometimes come across as a book
[263.58 → 269.94] with a lot of do's and a lot of don'tTS, and it becomes easy for us to hear a passage like this
[269.94 → 276.26] and feel a little bogged down perhaps with what James is saying. The truth is though, it's quite the
[276.26 → 282.88] opposite. God is not calling us to live our lives operating off of some monumental checklist, keeping
[282.88 → 289.64] track of the deeds we do and the sins that we commit. This is not a book about calling us to do more,
[289.64 → 297.38] but rather it's a book about calling us to live differently. James is a book of response, and
[297.38 → 303.98] today's passage is that message. We're called to respond to the word of God. Like I learned when I
[303.98 → 311.04] dislodged a piece of my tongue at the ripe old age of four, responding is vital. Not just hearing,
[311.68 → 319.06] not simply acknowledging what we hear, but doing something about it. James helps us figure out how to do that.
[319.64 → 325.14] So this is what we're going to walk through today. God calls us to live a new way of life,
[325.14 → 332.14] but we cannot do that if we do not respond to God's word, and we cannot respond to God's word
[332.14 → 340.08] unless we hear and listen to what he says. This is precisely how this text today breaks down. There are
[340.08 → 348.04] three chunks to this text, and each part works through this pattern of receive, respond, and resolve,
[348.04 → 355.30] or if you like A word, accept, act, and abide. So let's look at each one of these paragraphs separately,
[355.52 → 360.46] and we'll see how they move from accepting to responding to then transforming.
[362.30 → 366.22] All right, the first chunk first, because that's what makes sense. James 1, 19 to 21,
[366.32 → 370.94] my dear brothers and sisters, take note of this. Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak,
[371.00 → 376.14] and slow to become angry, because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires.
[376.14 → 383.06] Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent, and humbly accept the word
[383.06 → 391.54] planted in you which can save you. See that verse 21? We are to humbly accept the word planted in us
[391.54 → 398.66] which can save us. This paragraph is about accepting the word. We must be quick to listen
[398.66 → 404.58] so that we can accept the word of God that has been planted in us to save us. However, we can't
[404.58 → 410.38] accept that word if we're not listening. He says we are to be quick to listen, and I mean, that makes sense.
[411.04 → 414.72] We can't accept what we don't hear. If we don't listen, we don't understand.
[414.72 → 424.20] It's interesting how he also says, though, be slow to speak, and be slow to become angry.
[426.38 → 430.96] We humans, we can be so good at talking, can't we? We love to be heard, and if you're like me,
[431.22 → 436.14] you've got this loud, obnoxious voice that can fill a room, and you like to talk.
[436.14 → 445.38] Unfortunately, it's really hard to listen when you're so busy talking. Just ask my daughters.
[447.32 → 452.32] The author of Ecclesiastes, most likely Solomon, he knew this too when he wrote,
[452.62 → 459.80] the words of the wise heard in silence are better than the shouting of a ruler among fools.
[459.80 → 469.12] We think of our culture where we are constantly distracted. We fill our lives up with noise,
[469.82 → 473.60] where solitude is hard, perhaps even impossible to find.
[475.78 → 483.44] Most of us can afford to be slower to speak, perhaps even be silent.
[483.44 → 493.46] Anger, too, it has a way of making us unable to listen. When we get angry, or we get frustrated
[493.46 → 498.56] with others, it easily makes us stubborn and even prideful. Rather than listening in love,
[498.78 → 505.22] when we are disagreeing with each other, anger can boil up. That's why in 1 Corinthians 13,
[505.34 → 507.88] when Paul is going over what love is, he says,
[507.88 → 513.68] love does not insist on its own way. It is not irritable or resentful.
[516.02 → 520.46] Now, while this is a calling for us to rid ourselves of all anger and angry expression
[520.46 → 525.72] in our lives, there is room for feelings of anger, as long as it is righteous anger. However,
[525.96 → 530.20] I don't want to lengthen that leash longer than it needs to be, because the reality is,
[530.20 → 540.28] we are very, very, very seldom, seldomly, sorry, in a position where righteous anger is called for.
[542.22 → 549.56] So while we do well to feel angry sometimes, most often we choose the wrong time.
[551.56 → 558.24] James says, get rid of anger. Here he is. The reason James highlights anger so much is because
[558.24 → 565.06] of the extreme negative impact it can have on God's calling for our lives. The call to be holy and
[565.06 → 571.62] righteous. The call to live in community and love our neighbours. The call for truth and for love.
[573.78 → 578.48] Henry Drummond, he speaks of this negative impact of anger so wonderfully in his book,
[578.84 → 580.62] The Greatest Thing in the World. He writes this,
[580.62 → 590.10] No form of vice, not worldliness, not greed of gold, not drunkenness itself, does more to
[590.10 → 599.02] Christianize society than evil temper. For embittering life, for breaking up communities,
[599.44 → 605.98] for destroying the most sacred relationships, for devastating homes, for withering up men and
[605.98 → 616.62] women, for taking the bloom off of childhood. In short, for sheer, gratuitous, misery-producing power.
[618.06 → 620.50] This influence of anger stands alone.
[623.44 → 630.06] Anger destroys. And to the point of this text today, if you have anger in your life towards someone,
[630.06 → 635.00] someone that you know well or someone that you know poorly, it doesn't matter. James says,
[635.12 → 641.90] if you are angry, you do not have the ability to accept God's word which saves us.
[643.90 → 650.72] John Calvin says it too. He says, as long as wrath bears rule, there is no place for the righteousness of
[650.72 → 658.30] God. So in order to fully receive the word, we must put off all types of evil, especially wrath.
[658.30 → 665.48] Only then will we be able to accept Christ's word and have it fully implanted in our lives,
[665.62 → 668.02] which saves our souls.
[670.28 → 676.52] But, as the title of this sermon series says, we need to be more than simply just hearers.
[677.14 → 684.32] We must be doers as well. Reception is only step one. We must now respond as well.
[684.32 → 687.72] And the second chunk gets to that. Verse 22 to 25 says this.
[688.08 → 693.54] Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says.
[694.58 → 699.84] Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a
[699.84 → 706.28] mirror, and after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like.
[706.28 → 711.88] But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom and continues in it,
[712.00 → 718.26] not forgetting what they heard, but doing it, they will be blessed in what they do.
[721.36 → 725.92] Now, sometimes people get in a bit of a huff because James calls us to do here, and then they
[725.92 → 730.56] will counter by saying, well, hang on a second. The apostle Paul, he says faith alone saves.
[730.56 → 737.30] So how can James say otherwise? But listen to what Paul says in Romans 2.13.
[737.68 → 742.48] For it is not those who hear the law that are righteous in God's sight, but it is those who
[742.48 → 747.82] obey the law who will be declared righteous. See, they aren't that different. Paul and James
[747.82 → 753.84] aren't saying different things here. Listening must always lead to action, receiving to responding.
[754.08 → 760.10] Faith must always lead to deeds. They go hand in hand. You cannot separate them. To have faith is to
[760.10 → 766.64] obey. To obey is to have faith. Hearing is important, but it's not enough. We must respond.
[767.16 → 775.52] We must be doers. This is so important. Sometimes we get stuck here. We get stuck, but it's not enough
[775.52 → 781.68] to read the Bible. It's not enough to remember what it says or praise its contents or write down in our
[781.68 → 789.40] journals to reflect on later again. All of that is good, but it's only good as phase one. It's only good
[789.40 → 804.34] if we do what we hear. Faith saves. Faith without action, though, is just knowledge. And knowledge
[804.34 → 807.34] without obedience is useless.
[807.34 → 816.32] James uses the imagery of a person who looks in a mirror to highlight this point. And he says,
[816.40 → 820.44] the one who hears the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at himself in a
[820.44 → 824.98] mirror but instantly forgets what they look like. Now, perhaps that's a strange analogy to hear at
[824.98 → 832.08] first, but it is a brilliant one. See, when we look into a mirror, we see our face. We see its reflection.
[832.08 → 838.66] We see how God created us to look. But we also see the dirt and the muck and the mire.
[840.40 → 847.04] It shows up as spots that need washing. If we look in the mirror and then go away and forget to wash off
[847.04 → 855.16] the dirt, forgetting what we look like, what good was the mirror? But if we look in a mirror and we
[855.16 → 862.80] remember where the dirt is, we can be clean. This is an analogy that's not about vanity, and it's not
[862.80 → 870.76] about self-admiration. It's a call to repentance. It's a call to confession. We listen to the word.
[871.06 → 875.58] And when we do that, we will hear God's voice calling us to repent of the things that make us
[875.58 → 882.68] sinful. Like our reflection in a mirror, God's word will bring to light the areas in our life
[882.68 → 888.58] that we need to give back to God in repentance. If we listen to God's word,
[889.90 → 896.52] and the dirt in our life gets revealed, but we do nothing about it. If we don't repent,
[896.60 → 901.30] if we don't ask God to wash it away, what's good is hearing the word?
[903.46 → 910.72] Our sins are the spots that the mirror of the word of God reveals. Only Christ's blood washes that sin
[910.72 → 915.68] away. When we repent, we are cleansed. Our sin is washed. That is how we are to respond,
[916.08 → 921.82] especially during this season of Lent. May we remember the cost of that sin. May we remember
[921.82 → 929.72] the dirt on our face. May we remember what Ash Wednesday represents. And may we give it all to
[929.72 → 939.00] Christ. James says that when we look intently into the perfect law that gives freedom,
[940.00 → 945.44] that is when we are blessed in what we do. Now, I like what the ESV translation says here a little
[945.44 → 952.60] bit better. That translation says, he who looks into the perfect law of liberty, he will be blessed in
[952.60 → 960.70] his doing. I like to highlight two things about that little chunk. First is this. The law of liberty
[960.70 → 969.98] is God's perfect law, which Christ came and fulfilled. Law and liberty, they kind of contradict each other
[969.98 → 976.30] in our language, don't they? Law restricts us. It tells us the speed limits we're to drive, the places
[976.30 → 983.88] we can and cannot go, the things we can and cannot do. But liberty, liberty frees us, allowing us to
[983.88 → 989.28] break the chains of bondage. Everyone wants liberty. And while most of us understand laws and approve of
[989.28 → 995.62] laws and see the good in laws, they are restricting. They restrict what we can do. Never has this been
[995.62 → 1000.00] more prevalent to me than during this pandemic. Laws are restricting. And while we do our best to
[1000.00 → 1005.90] abide by them and see the importance of them, then do we await the liberty where we can be free from
[1005.90 → 1013.42] those restrictions? This is what's so beautiful about this passage and this language that James uses here.
[1013.82 → 1022.16] God's law is the perfect law of liberty. By saying this, James highlights how God's law frees us.
[1023.74 → 1030.46] We do not need to be free from the law. We are free because of the law. This is counterintuitive for
[1030.46 → 1037.00] our culture. Jesus says, if you hold to my teachings, you are really my disciples.
[1038.08 → 1042.52] Then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free.
[1044.00 → 1049.36] If we hold to Jesus' teachings to love God and love your neighbour as yourself, the same law
[1049.36 → 1054.46] that God gave Moses, we will know the truth and the truth will set us free.
[1054.46 → 1066.36] The beauty of it all is that God's law liberates because God's Son is already liberated. Christ lived
[1066.36 → 1071.98] a perfect life, and then he died on the cross for us all. He fulfilled the law because his death
[1071.98 → 1078.88] was ours to die. And then he rose again from the grave, defeating sin and death until he comes out,
[1078.88 → 1088.04] comes once and for all for the perfect redemption of all the cosmos, where God gets eternal glory.
[1089.26 → 1095.12] That is why our response is one of repentance and confession, because when we confess to the one
[1095.12 → 1105.60] who has already saved, we are free. And when we respond to God's calling in love, to him and to others,
[1105.60 → 1114.56] God's perfect law of liberty frees us through Christ's life, death and resurrection. Amen.
[1115.76 → 1119.54] That's not the end of the sermon. That's just an amen moment. There's more. The second part of that line
[1119.54 → 1125.70] is equally beautiful. Our response in faith is one of repentance that frees us. And when we are free,
[1125.70 → 1135.52] hear this, we are blessed in our doing. That little two-letter word is so important. Notice James does not say
[1135.52 → 1142.80] we are blessed by our doing. We are not saved by what we do. We are only saved by faith in Christ.
[1142.80 → 1152.28] We are not blessed by our deeds. What we are is blessed in our deeds. While our deeds do not save us,
[1152.36 → 1157.90] and we are not blessed because we do them, we are blessed in doing them.
[1159.48 → 1164.80] James is clear. It's not graced by works. It's grace by our perfect Saviour, Jesus Christ. However, we are blessed
[1164.80 → 1170.86] in the deeds we do as a response to that grace. It's beautiful language, and it's very important
[1170.86 → 1175.10] to wrap our heads around here. There's going to be a lot more on this in future sermons, so I'm going
[1175.10 → 1180.26] to leave it there. But buckle up for the future, but I hope that this lays a little bit of groundwork
[1180.26 → 1187.96] there. So back to the framework of this text. First we receive the word, or accept it. Then we're called
[1187.96 → 1195.44] to respond to the word, or act on it. And finally, James calls us all to resolve ourselves to a new
[1195.44 → 1204.20] way of life, or to abide by God's word. This calling to abide, it's a bigger thing. Abiding is not simply
[1204.20 → 1210.74] responding sometimes. We're not supposed to respond a certain number of times to appease God.
[1210.74 → 1217.70] Again, that's checklist theology. We're called to abide by God's word. That means live in God's truth.
[1218.04 → 1227.04] We accept, we respond as a way of life, not with a list of do's. The final two verses of our text get
[1227.04 → 1231.84] to this point. We read it as follows. Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep
[1231.84 → 1237.98] a tight rein on their tongue deceives themselves, and their religion is worthless. Religion that our God
[1237.98 → 1244.20] the Father accepts as pure and faultless is this, to look after orphans and widows in their distress,
[1244.48 → 1247.22] and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.
[1249.64 → 1253.86] Pastor Chris did an excellent job in his pastor study video this week, highlighting the importance
[1253.86 → 1260.34] of tradition in the church. Tradition that's centred on Christ, on grace and mercy, and the right
[1260.34 → 1267.20] following of Christ in his word is wonderful. In that video, Pastor Chris also does a great job of
[1267.20 → 1273.70] speaking how sometimes traditions can turn into traditionalism. Traditions for the sake of
[1273.70 → 1279.48] traditions, missing out on the grace and the mercy and the love. Traditionalism is not good,
[1279.72 → 1285.24] and that's what James is speaking against here. See, we see throughout the Bible that ceremonies and
[1285.24 → 1292.34] sacrifices are good things, so long as grace and love and mercy are present. But without grace, love,
[1292.34 → 1296.80] and mercy, religion becomes vain. There are lots of passages in the Bible that speak against this.
[1297.14 → 1305.68] Hosea 6, 6, Matthew 9, 13, Mark 12, 32 to 32, Luke 6, 36. Rewind, pause, write them down, look them up. We
[1305.68 → 1311.76] don't have time today. They all talk about that. Religion is worthless if we do not do what God
[1311.76 → 1320.76] requires of us. But what does the Lord require of you. All the gems everywhere stand and say in unison
[1320.76 → 1329.64] to act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God. That is the life in which we are
[1329.64 → 1338.24] called to live. Lives that we live where we act justly, where we love mercy, and where we walk humbly
[1338.24 → 1345.54] with our God. Keeping ourselves from being polluted by this world is a little harder than we think,
[1345.64 → 1353.92] though. You see, we're all influenced by a story, the Western story. Some of us are influenced in
[1353.92 → 1358.98] different ways than others, but we're all caught in that story. We're all caught in that current.
[1358.98 → 1366.34] I read this article by Jeremy Slim is his name, and he wrote about a time when he went to an
[1366.34 → 1371.06] outdoors water park with his wife and his two sons, and after doing a bunch of the water slides, they
[1371.06 → 1375.60] decided to relax a little bit, take a break from all the stairs, and they decided to grab a tube,
[1376.04 → 1381.32] the inner tube each, and just go float in the lazy river. So they did that. It was very relaxing.
[1381.44 → 1387.20] There was no effort, just lazily floating in this artificial current. Well, after a few minutes,
[1387.20 → 1391.22] though his kids got bored, and they wanted out, but when they tried to get out of this lazy river,
[1391.74 → 1396.88] they realized how hard it was to find footing in the current. There was an exit, but they didn't get
[1396.88 → 1401.16] off their tubes in time, and when they did get off their tubes, they couldn't find their footing. His
[1401.16 → 1407.32] the youngest son got pulled under the water. His oldest son got ripped down the current. His wife jumped off
[1407.32 → 1412.88] her tube, but she couldn't stop it either, and it took Jeremy a lot of effort and a lot of time to gather
[1412.88 → 1420.48] his kids and his wife and his footing and get out of the exit of that lazy river current. What seemed to
[1420.48 → 1429.54] be this relaxing, slow-moving novelty was actually a very fast-moving current that they got stuck in.
[1430.76 → 1437.26] Finding their footing and moving against it proved extremely difficult. Perhaps you know a story very
[1437.26 → 1444.12] similar to that. Jeremy compared that story to living as Christ followers in the Western culture.
[1445.80 → 1452.26] We are all part of the Western current, and it may not seem so bad. It may seem kind of
[1453.20 → 1459.28] laissez-faire, but to go against it is a lot of work. There are many things in our culture that pull us
[1459.28 → 1465.02] along, and if we're not careful or if we're not prepared to encounter those things, we can get swept
[1465.02 → 1473.24] right up in the current. Jeremy says, loving our enemies seems like a fantasy in the current that
[1473.24 → 1481.28] says defeat. Hospitality to the poor seems impossible in the current that says consume. Humility is rare
[1481.28 → 1488.88] in a current that encourages bluster. Love that risks the safe and the rational are unimaginable in a
[1488.88 → 1497.72] current that promises security. We must resolve ourselves to a new narrative. We must root ourselves
[1497.72 → 1503.60] in the story of Scripture. We must keep ourselves from being polluted from this world. Furthermore, we must equip
[1503.60 → 1510.26] ourselves with the tools of Scripture to push back against the current of our culture.
[1512.76 → 1518.00] Fasting can help us fight the current of materialism. Generosity can help us fight the current of greed.
[1518.00 → 1523.72] Community can help us fight the current of individualism. Prayer can help us fight the current of
[1523.72 → 1530.10] rationalism. Silence can help us fight the current of gossip. Lament can help us fight the current of
[1530.10 → 1536.98] apathy. When we abide by this calling, when we abide in God's story, not the Western story,
[1537.84 → 1543.20] we resolve ourselves to this new, more glorious life in Christ.
[1543.20 → 1549.60] Conclude with this. James is calling us all to resolve ourselves to this new way of life,
[1549.60 → 1558.04] to this new posture of which we are to operate out of. But we are called to his holiness. We are called
[1558.04 → 1568.12] to live righteous lives. We are called to accept God's Word and then act on God's Word and then fully
[1568.12 → 1578.96] abide by God's Word. Then we start to shape our lives by God's story. Not our story, not the West's story.
[1579.64 → 1587.50] Then we become both hearers, doers. Amen. For real, this time. Let's pray.
[1587.50 → 1599.92] God, we thank you for your Word. We thank you for the gospel truth of your Son come down to earth
[1599.92 → 1608.82] to live a perfect life, to die on the cross for our sins, who raised from the dead, defeating sin
[1608.82 → 1621.42] and death forever. God, may we accept that Word. May we accept that truth. And Lord, may we not just
[1621.42 → 1627.74] simply accept it, but may we act on it. May we go out and live as you call us to live, respond as you
[1627.74 → 1633.86] call us to respond. And not only that, God, may we abide in that truth. May that not just be lists of
[1633.86 → 1641.48] things to do and don't, but may that be the new reality in which you call us to live. Holy Spirit,
[1641.60 → 1649.80] work in our hearts so we can live out this truth. We pray this in your Son's precious, holy name. Amen.
