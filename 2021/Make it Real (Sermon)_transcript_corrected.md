[1.00 → 8.50] This morning we are going to start a new teaching series here through the letter of James.
[9.06 → 13.34] I'm going to encourage you to have a Bible with you so that we can read through that.
[13.60 → 18.74] You can spend time throughout the week reading through the letter, familiarizing yourself with it,
[18.76 → 27.48] that we can come into this, into our gathered worship on Sundays and dig deeply into what God has to say to us.
[27.48 → 34.38] I'm going to read from the first eight verses of James, so I invite you to find that.
[34.48 → 35.90] James is near the end of your Bible.
[36.88 → 41.02] If you open up to the back and then flip a few pages the other way, you will find James eventually.
[41.88 → 44.66] And it will also be on the screen there, as you can see.
[45.24 → 47.82] So, from James 1, let me read with you.
[49.28 → 56.56] James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes scattered among the nations,
[56.56 → 57.68] Greetings.
[59.38 → 64.48] Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds,
[64.80 → 68.92] because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance.
[70.52 → 76.86] Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.
[76.86 → 85.38] If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault,
[85.66 → 86.94] and it will be given to him.
[87.80 → 90.34] But when he asks, he must believe and not doubt,
[90.62 → 94.74] because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea blown and tossed by the wind.
[95.38 → 98.34] That man should not think that he will receive anything from the Lord.
[98.60 → 102.70] He is a double-minded man, unstable in all he does.
[102.70 → 104.54] This is the word of the Lord.
[104.54 → 114.32] I want to begin this morning with a little, maybe it's a personal story,
[114.54 → 119.08] maybe it's too personal for you, and I apologize if that is the case,
[119.18 → 122.36] and I'm happy to receive your emails and phone calls as a result.
[122.86 → 127.50] But some of you have heard my faith story, or part of my faith story,
[127.58 → 130.08] some of you haven't heard part of that yet.
[130.08 → 134.90] And I'm going to change a little bit of that this morning, at least part of it.
[135.80 → 145.12] So when I was 18 or 19 in my early 20s, to be honest, I was not a Christian.
[146.56 → 149.52] And don't get me wrong, I went to church every Sunday.
[150.08 → 151.66] I knew all the right words.
[152.00 → 156.62] I could answer the pastors of my church appropriately whenever they asked me any questions.
[156.62 → 164.72] But more often than not, I was out getting high, was partying on the weekends,
[164.98 → 171.42] I was drinking and getting drunk and taking advantage of people and situations and circumstances,
[171.70 → 178.12] and generally not caring much about anything more than my own pursuit of hedonistic pleasure.
[178.12 → 185.06] Now to put it simply, in my life, I was a functional atheist.
[186.06 → 186.66] Right?
[186.70 → 191.96] I used the words of Christianity, and I might even say that I believed it,
[192.76 → 196.00] but it didn't change anything about the way I lived my life.
[196.68 → 197.02] Right?
[197.06 → 201.48] My functioning in the world was as if God didn't really exist,
[201.48 → 205.40] and that his redemption held no claim over me,
[205.52 → 208.70] and that his lordship didn't matter to any part of my life.
[210.40 → 215.16] And even when I engaged the claims of faith,
[215.82 → 220.42] it was from the perspective of how much can I get away with?
[221.52 → 221.96] Right?
[222.04 → 225.72] Or to put it another way, and you know, I know teenagers love to ask this question,
[225.88 → 227.60] but so do all of us as Christians.
[227.60 → 230.74] And I wondered, how far is too far?
[232.38 → 232.84] Right?
[232.86 → 237.50] And I had a soft moralism on this sort of big issues like abortion,
[238.10 → 241.92] but really, that was easy, because it didn't affect me personally.
[242.58 → 242.80] Right?
[242.82 → 246.52] And I wouldn't work on Sundays, but that wasn't about Sabbath rest.
[246.86 → 249.40] That was about me keeping my parents off my back,
[249.54 → 252.44] and having a day that I was guaranteed to not have to work.
[254.58 → 257.22] I went through the motions of faith.
[258.32 → 258.48] Right?
[258.60 → 265.54] Christian school, cadets, church, youth group, catechism, even profession of faith.
[265.90 → 269.64] And yeah, I'm sure that in my mind, at least at times,
[269.68 → 272.74] I really believed what I was saying, right, on an intellectual level.
[272.74 → 275.42] But my beliefs didn't change me.
[276.32 → 280.82] And it didn't change the way I lived, or the way I talked, or the way I acted.
[280.82 → 288.94] To paraphrase a really famous quote from Brennan Manning, right?
[288.94 → 296.96] I was the Christian who acknowledged Jesus with my lips, left, and denied him with my lifestyle.
[298.38 → 299.76] Have you heard that quote before?
[299.76 → 307.42] Actually, in the 90s, on a DC Talk album, it was part of one of the songs at the beginning.
[307.58 → 309.36] That was where I was first exposed to it.
[309.36 → 314.60] But it never hit me until years later, in my 20s.
[315.42 → 316.80] A quote from Brennan Manning says,
[316.80 → 330.00] And I get it now, right?
[330.00 → 336.32] I know enough about the Bible and about human condition, about the religious impulse, about epistemology and spirituality.
[337.20 → 341.84] I know enough about philosophy and non-contradictory logical statements
[341.84 → 346.66] to know that this statement from Brennan Manning isn't absolutely or comprehensively true.
[346.96 → 351.58] It's not an adequate explanation of sin and the realities of sin.
[351.72 → 357.56] I know that there's a difference between a causal link and saying where there really is only a correlation.
[357.56 → 359.28] I know all of that.
[360.32 → 371.26] But still, my heart breaks when I think about how I may have been a stumbling block.
[372.26 → 379.78] When I think about how my actions or inactions might have impacted the people that I knew back then in my life
[379.78 → 383.14] and led them away from experiencing Jesus.
[383.14 → 397.14] When I think about how the impact of my life and decisions may have influenced my brothers
[397.14 → 406.76] and how they encounter faith and the lack or the lack of their faith.
[406.76 → 409.88] And I wrestle with that.
[410.52 → 411.48] And I carry that.
[413.16 → 414.10] And that's hard.
[420.58 → 432.22] In 2011, there was a study that was done by a group of psychologists and sociologists in Canada
[432.22 → 436.08] of Canadian Christian young people.
[436.44 → 439.40] And that was published under the title of Hemorrhaging Faith.
[440.60 → 444.52] In 2018, there was a follow-up study to that that was done by the same people.
[444.58 → 446.84] And that was published under the title of Renegotiating Faith.
[447.80 → 451.64] In the U.S., for the last number of years, a couple of decades even,
[451.90 → 454.20] the Barn Group has done a similar study.
[454.20 → 461.14] And David Cinnamon has published the results in a series of books called Unchristian and You Lost Me and the like.
[461.92 → 467.64] And in all of those studies, there is a common theme that works its way right through.
[468.58 → 471.66] Now, these studies focus on youth and young people.
[471.82 → 474.22] And so it's given from their perspective.
[474.84 → 477.00] But I think we'll be able to see how much it matters.
[477.00 → 484.62] In the shifting of faith commitments and the realities of youth and young people leaving the church
[484.62 → 486.40] and the faith that they grew up in,
[486.54 → 490.20] there is a common theme that runs through all the survey answers.
[490.94 → 494.14] For so many of these people, when they were interviewed and asked about it,
[494.34 → 498.56] when they looked at the faith, when they looked at church, right,
[498.56 → 502.08] and that is the experience of their parents and their peers,
[502.32 → 504.84] it didn't make a difference.
[507.00 → 513.22] Overwhelmingly, they would say their parents looked exactly the same as their non-Christian friends' parents.
[514.14 → 514.56] Right?
[514.60 → 515.64] They did the same things.
[515.76 → 516.76] They talked the same way.
[516.86 → 518.36] They complained about the same things.
[518.46 → 521.88] They worked, and they lived, and they pursued after the same things.
[522.72 → 524.56] And the thinking here is this, right?
[524.60 → 528.42] That if your faith doesn't really change anything about you,
[528.42 → 532.08] why should I change anything about me to say I have that faith?
[533.44 → 534.72] And let's be honest.
[534.98 → 536.78] That's a perfect question.
[537.00 → 543.70] In fact, that kind of thinking, a few years ago,
[544.42 → 549.78] at the peak of the sort of new atheist movement that was sort of in vogue for a little while,
[550.48 → 554.58] one of the four horsemen of the new atheist movement, Christopher Hitchens,
[554.76 → 556.86] he wrote a book called God is Not Great,
[556.86 → 561.86] and it was an argument against religious belief generally and Christianity in particular.
[561.86 → 572.58] And his main argument over and over and over and over again throughout that book is anecdotal stories of people who call themselves Christian or people who call themselves religious,
[572.58 → 575.06] but brought hurt and pain into the world.
[575.06 → 586.42] If our faith doesn't change anything in our lives, why do we expect people to change anything in their lives to believe the same?
[587.62 → 593.82] And if your faith isn't making a difference beyond what you do on Sunday morning or what school you go to,
[593.82 → 598.20] is that really a compelling faith?
[599.90 → 601.82] Think about it with me.
[601.82 → 605.82] If your life looks the same as your neighbour who doesn't believe.
[607.22 → 609.00] Or let's get real focused for a moment.
[609.32 → 615.30] If you are more excited about the Super Bowl today than you've ever been about Jesus,
[615.30 → 619.26] what compelling reason are you giving for people to believe the same as you?
[621.22 → 627.76] And I know that some of us listening this morning are like me when I was 18 and 19 years old.
[627.86 → 630.34] We are functional atheists.
[631.32 → 637.32] And I know some of us are yet convicted by the gospel, and so we live uncompelling lives.
[637.48 → 642.52] And I know that some of us are just new to faith, or we're new to taking faith seriously,
[642.52 → 645.78] and so we're learning what maturity looks like, right?
[645.82 → 651.46] Some of us have never really been challenged to reflect on life and faith in this way.
[651.46 → 661.74] And some of us, probably most of us, have felt this niggling thing in the back of your mind or in the corner of your heart
[661.74 → 664.66] that is God whispering, saying, enough is enough.
[664.90 → 666.30] I want more for you.
[667.58 → 669.74] Make it real with me.
[669.74 → 672.00] Make it real.
[673.28 → 677.28] That's our goal in this series in the letter of James.
[678.00 → 680.86] That's James' goal in writing this letter, right?
[680.88 → 685.48] That the early believers would make their faith real,
[685.52 → 689.68] that it would be more than just a set of ideas or propositions that they would assent to.
[690.68 → 694.46] Now this morning, we're going to sort of do a quick introduction to this new series
[694.46 → 696.90] that we're going to spend our time in.
[696.90 → 700.06] Now, the letter begins,
[700.50 → 704.26] James, he identifies himself a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[704.32 → 705.98] and then he tells us who he's writing to.
[706.28 → 710.26] And he's writing to the twelve tribes scattered among the nations.
[710.38 → 711.84] Now, without getting too deeply into it,
[711.86 → 716.98] there's a lot of discussion in biblical studies about who that might be.
[717.28 → 720.16] The consensus is, and where I tend to agree,
[720.16 → 725.86] is that James is writing to a group of Jewish Christians
[725.86 → 730.08] who are scattered throughout the region outside of Palestine.
[731.02 → 731.34] Right?
[731.40 → 732.62] Their faith is young.
[732.84 → 737.08] And this letter is intended to be a circulating letter,
[737.14 → 738.66] or sometimes it's called a Catholic letter,
[738.72 → 740.90] that it goes out to a wide group of people
[740.90 → 746.74] to encourage them in their faith and in the living of life for Jesus.
[746.74 → 749.46] And so because their faith is young,
[750.10 → 756.38] they are facing pressure from fellow Jews to return to the old ways.
[756.72 → 756.84] Right?
[756.90 → 762.42] They're facing pressures from the Roman world to adapt and to compromise their beliefs.
[762.94 → 763.04] Right?
[763.04 → 767.22] And in that, facing pressure from the old ways
[767.22 → 769.82] and facing pressure in the Roman world,
[769.96 → 773.66] they're being ostracized or looked down upon
[773.66 → 779.02] or rejected or outcast from their communities,
[779.46 → 781.68] whether it's in the guilds that they work in
[781.68 → 783.28] or even from their families.
[784.74 → 784.92] Right?
[784.96 → 788.52] In some cases, they're even being violently persecuted,
[789.36 → 790.18] maybe even killed.
[790.18 → 796.68] We can summarize and say that the social pressures to conform are powerful.
[797.48 → 802.96] The religious pressures to compromise give an easy believes.
[803.68 → 808.04] And the culture is holding out a vision of life and happiness and blessing
[808.04 → 813.16] that is so tantalizing and so clearly visible right in front of their faces,
[813.16 → 815.78] it feels like they could actually grab hold of it.
[815.78 → 819.50] And when we put the context that way,
[820.44 → 823.80] it sounds remarkably like our time.
[824.98 → 827.44] Remarkably like what we face.
[828.68 → 830.28] Stop being intolerant.
[831.64 → 832.90] Don't be a prude.
[834.02 → 835.66] You have to try this.
[835.72 → 837.30] It's so good.
[837.30 → 842.38] And it's so easy to slip into that,
[842.46 → 843.56] to buy into that,
[843.62 → 845.26] to shift our priorities,
[845.46 → 848.40] to give ourselves over in that.
[848.64 → 850.76] And James is coming in this letter
[850.76 → 853.00] and throughout, hopefully, our teaching series,
[853.08 → 853.80] and he says,
[854.04 → 854.86] make it real.
[855.52 → 859.14] Jesus' voice is speaking to us at this moment,
[859.14 → 859.92] and he is saying,
[860.04 → 862.66] I have so much more for you.
[862.66 → 866.80] So here's the thing.
[868.72 → 872.38] The world holds out a promise to you,
[872.68 → 878.24] but it takes away with the left hand what it's giving with the right.
[879.20 → 885.24] The gospel holds out a better reality for us,
[885.24 → 889.62] a resurrection reality, a real reality.
[889.62 → 895.76] And that's where we need to find ourselves this morning.
[899.14 → 903.58] One scholar that I read this week put it this way,
[903.66 → 907.62] said that the letter of James ultimately has more to say
[907.62 → 911.22] about the problem of the world getting into the church.
[911.38 → 912.94] That James' concern is,
[912.96 → 913.72] and I'll quote him here,
[913.80 → 914.02] he says,
[914.02 → 915.18] his readers,
[916.28 → 919.36] James is concerned that his readers stop compromising
[919.36 → 921.44] with worldly values and behaviour
[921.44 → 924.96] and give themselves wholly to the Lord.
[926.52 → 929.42] What James wants for us
[929.42 → 933.48] is a spiritual wholeness.
[934.50 → 935.26] And in many ways,
[935.26 → 937.12] in these first few verses,
[938.02 → 939.44] he outlines for us
[939.44 → 942.30] the path towards wholeness.
[942.30 → 944.02] And in that journey,
[944.02 → 948.06] says there will be hardships and trials along the way.
[948.36 → 949.48] If you have that in front of you,
[949.50 → 950.22] you can see it.
[951.32 → 953.74] Verses two through four
[953.74 → 956.06] kind of take us along this way.
[956.14 → 958.96] But you have this introduction or this word,
[959.12 → 960.36] consider it pure joy,
[960.44 → 961.30] my brothers and sisters,
[961.40 → 964.14] whenever you face trials of many kinds.
[964.18 → 966.76] And we've outlined what some of those might have been.
[966.82 → 969.12] Not just violence or persecution,
[969.12 → 970.98] but the way that they have been ostracized,
[971.06 → 973.48] the way that they have been rejected
[973.48 → 975.96] by their communities or families of origin,
[976.18 → 978.22] the way that they have been tempted
[978.22 → 980.58] to compromise their faith and belief
[980.58 → 982.80] in the culture that is around them.
[983.42 → 985.70] And that trials of many kinds
[985.70 → 987.22] is linked directly,
[987.22 → 988.30] in verse three,
[988.46 → 991.76] with the testing of your faith.
[992.14 → 993.22] And these are challenges
[993.22 → 995.08] to what you say you believe.
[995.08 → 997.82] What you say is really important.
[998.68 → 999.90] What you say really matters.
[1000.82 → 1001.86] And facing these trials,
[1002.04 → 1003.68] enduring these testing,
[1003.94 → 1006.88] is given so that you might persevere,
[1007.06 → 1009.88] so that you might develop perseverance.
[1010.78 → 1012.90] And just like when you're learning
[1012.90 → 1014.46] to be a long distance runner,
[1014.60 → 1016.40] you've got to push through the hardship,
[1016.60 → 1017.98] push through the trials.
[1018.14 → 1020.46] Just like when you're learning how to do anything,
[1020.60 → 1021.72] learning any new skill,
[1021.78 → 1023.26] you've got to push through the failures.
[1023.26 → 1025.44] You have to practice and practice and practice.
[1025.72 → 1026.88] And even when you fail,
[1026.94 → 1029.14] you have to get back up and try again.
[1029.76 → 1033.08] Your testing of your faith develops perseverance.
[1034.96 → 1036.00] And perseverance,
[1036.32 → 1039.40] when you push through to the end,
[1040.20 → 1042.10] must finish its work in you
[1042.10 → 1046.14] so that you may be mature and complete.
[1046.14 → 1052.68] This is a beautiful expression in the Greek here
[1052.68 → 1057.28] that is more than just maturity
[1057.28 → 1059.92] in the sense of growing old
[1059.92 → 1063.18] and becoming who you are.
[1063.42 → 1064.30] There's a sense,
[1064.44 → 1066.80] the word there actually is the same word
[1066.80 → 1069.44] from which we get the word tells or end.
[1069.90 → 1073.28] This is the purpose for which you have been created,
[1073.28 → 1076.26] the purpose for which you have been redeemed.
[1076.74 → 1078.16] And so you face these trials
[1078.16 → 1080.60] and you endure and persevere in testing
[1080.60 → 1085.48] so that you might find your very purpose for existence.
[1086.74 → 1088.80] And then you might be mature,
[1089.02 → 1092.50] have purpose and fullness and complete.
[1093.06 → 1095.98] And that word complete there is really about wholeness.
[1096.06 → 1097.74] It's about having the lot,
[1097.96 → 1099.38] literally in Greek.
[1099.38 → 1103.46] that God has all of this in store for you.
[1103.58 → 1107.96] This restoration to who you were designed and created to be,
[1108.08 → 1111.38] this restoration to who you are as a child of God,
[1111.48 → 1113.24] adopted as sons and daughters,
[1113.44 → 1115.14] heirs and co-heirs with Christ.
[1115.40 → 1119.90] This is God's will for you.
[1121.66 → 1125.10] And it's restored to perfect fellowship
[1125.10 → 1127.84] and relationship with him.
[1129.38 → 1131.30] This is who we are.
[1131.42 → 1134.32] This is what real faith looks like.
[1134.40 → 1138.38] And the challenge is to increase our capacities to live
[1138.38 → 1140.18] and to experience that.
[1140.34 → 1140.92] And yet,
[1141.68 → 1144.84] there are many trials,
[1145.92 → 1148.92] many tests along the way,
[1149.58 → 1150.68] and many temptations
[1150.68 → 1152.28] to compromise
[1152.28 → 1154.08] or to go a different way.
[1154.08 → 1155.10] In fact,
[1155.16 → 1156.52] that contrast comes out,
[1156.56 → 1156.76] right?
[1157.00 → 1157.94] In verse 8,
[1158.94 → 1160.26] James says,
[1161.14 → 1161.74] verse 7,
[1161.94 → 1163.44] should not think you will receive anything from the Lord.
[1163.52 → 1166.20] He is a double-minded man.
[1167.12 → 1167.48] Literally,
[1167.62 → 1170.72] that's a two-psyched person,
[1170.86 → 1173.08] the root of our modern word psychology,
[1173.26 → 1173.36] right?
[1173.38 → 1175.16] Having two psyches.
[1175.26 → 1175.56] And really,
[1175.76 → 1178.90] the way I see it is that you're pulled in two different directions.
[1178.90 → 1181.66] And that's what it means to be Christian,
[1181.82 → 1182.72] living in the world,
[1182.80 → 1184.74] is that we are pulled in the direction of the gospel
[1184.74 → 1186.50] and godliness and holiness,
[1186.68 → 1189.72] and we are pulled in the direction of the world
[1189.72 → 1190.64] and sin
[1190.64 → 1193.40] and anything else that might be fleeting
[1193.40 → 1194.92] or fleeing.
[1195.68 → 1196.96] And here we stand
[1196.96 → 1198.66] in the middle,
[1200.66 → 1201.52] pulled
[1201.52 → 1203.14] and asked to decide
[1203.14 → 1204.52] which way
[1204.52 → 1205.40] will you
[1205.40 → 1206.30] go.
[1208.08 → 1209.36] What really is
[1209.36 → 1210.94] that picture of wholeness
[1210.94 → 1211.88] and faithfulness
[1211.88 → 1212.74] that is compelling
[1212.74 → 1214.56] and that you will pursue after?
[1215.42 → 1216.64] Is it what God has?
[1217.92 → 1219.40] Or is it what the world offers?
[1221.62 → 1223.98] To make our faith real,
[1224.58 → 1225.90] according to James,
[1226.18 → 1228.40] is to be both hearers
[1228.40 → 1229.96] and doers
[1229.96 → 1230.94] of the word.
[1230.94 → 1232.12] And that's what this series is called,
[1232.24 → 1233.70] hearers and doers.
[1233.76 → 1235.30] And we will focus on that
[1235.30 → 1237.10] more closely later on,
[1237.14 → 1237.94] but that comes from
[1237.94 → 1238.32] verse
[1238.32 → 1239.98] 22
[1239.98 → 1241.30] of chapter 1
[1241.30 → 1241.76] where it says,
[1241.88 → 1243.40] do not merely listen to the word
[1243.40 → 1245.14] and so deceive yourselves.
[1246.18 → 1246.58] Remember,
[1246.66 → 1247.54] I listened to the word,
[1247.60 → 1248.20] I knew the word,
[1248.26 → 1249.52] but I was a functional atheist.
[1250.62 → 1252.44] Do not merely listen to the word
[1252.44 → 1253.56] and so deceive yourselves.
[1254.02 → 1254.92] Do what
[1254.92 → 1255.50] it
[1255.50 → 1256.34] says.
[1257.86 → 1258.86] So how do you make it real?
[1258.86 → 1259.42] Well,
[1259.42 → 1260.38] you hear the word
[1260.38 → 1261.50] and you do it.
[1262.08 → 1263.54] You have the faith
[1263.54 → 1264.98] and you live it.
[1266.20 → 1266.68] And look,
[1266.70 → 1268.70] I know it's not easy.
[1269.54 → 1270.30] And in fact,
[1271.10 → 1272.44] to do this well
[1272.44 → 1273.60] and comprehensively,
[1273.66 → 1274.60] there will be times,
[1274.72 → 1275.52] there will be circumstances,
[1275.70 → 1276.36] there will be places,
[1276.36 → 1277.34] and there will be people
[1277.34 → 1278.40] in your life
[1278.40 → 1279.54] who think you are weird,
[1279.70 → 1280.98] who think you are strange,
[1281.10 → 1281.88] who think that you are
[1281.88 → 1282.84] the odd person out,
[1282.84 → 1284.72] and they will make fun of you
[1284.72 → 1285.34] for it.
[1285.38 → 1286.56] They will ostracize you
[1286.56 → 1287.24] for it.
[1287.28 → 1288.28] They may even
[1288.28 → 1289.56] persecute you
[1289.56 → 1290.50] for it.
[1292.84 → 1294.44] And I know that we like to think
[1294.44 → 1296.48] perhaps in different categories
[1296.48 → 1297.76] when we say things like
[1297.76 → 1299.16] how far is too far
[1299.16 → 1300.78] or when we try to think
[1300.78 → 1302.32] of our faith system
[1302.32 → 1304.16] strictly in these categories
[1304.16 → 1305.44] of morality.
[1305.44 → 1308.20] It was Tim Chester
[1308.20 → 1308.88] who said
[1308.88 → 1310.32] that one of our problems
[1310.32 → 1311.12] is that we think
[1311.12 → 1311.72] of holiness
[1311.72 → 1312.94] as giving up things
[1312.94 → 1313.58] we enjoy
[1313.58 → 1314.68] out of a vague sense
[1314.68 → 1315.40] of obligation.
[1316.24 → 1316.94] But he goes on,
[1317.00 → 1317.62] I am convinced
[1317.62 → 1318.38] that holiness
[1318.38 → 1320.28] is always good news.
[1321.42 → 1322.18] And so what does it mean
[1322.18 → 1323.00] to make it real?
[1323.22 → 1323.38] Well,
[1323.40 → 1324.46] it means to really believe
[1324.46 → 1325.32] and live
[1325.32 → 1326.02] that the life
[1326.02 → 1327.14] that God has designed
[1327.14 → 1327.60] for you,
[1327.68 → 1328.44] one of holiness
[1328.44 → 1329.30] and purity,
[1329.44 → 1331.22] is actually better
[1331.22 → 1332.62] than whatever else
[1332.62 → 1333.54] the world might have
[1333.54 → 1334.50] to offer you.
[1335.18 → 1336.12] And that's why
[1336.12 → 1337.30] James can say
[1337.30 → 1339.02] consider it pure joy
[1339.02 → 1340.22] my brothers and sisters
[1340.22 → 1341.24] whenever you face trials
[1341.24 → 1341.86] of many kinds.
[1341.90 → 1343.46] Because even in the facing
[1343.46 → 1344.22] of those trials,
[1344.38 → 1345.34] even in the challenges
[1345.34 → 1346.98] to the living out
[1346.98 → 1347.54] of our faith,
[1347.62 → 1348.74] to the making it real
[1348.74 → 1349.74] of our faith,
[1349.78 → 1351.18] it is joyful
[1351.18 → 1353.70] to be found
[1353.70 → 1355.48] in God
[1355.48 → 1357.18] and living in the way
[1357.18 → 1358.66] that he does
[1358.66 → 1360.04] and has designed
[1360.04 → 1360.92] for us.
[1361.82 → 1362.36] And James,
[1362.72 → 1363.12] then,
[1363.24 → 1364.44] will take this idea
[1364.44 → 1365.60] of making it real
[1365.60 → 1366.82] and he will apply it
[1366.82 → 1367.92] throughout the letter
[1367.92 → 1368.52] and this is where
[1368.52 → 1369.58] we'll spend our time
[1369.58 → 1370.58] for this next number
[1370.58 → 1372.00] of weeks and months
[1372.00 → 1373.42] looking at these
[1373.42 → 1374.14] different things.
[1374.28 → 1375.72] But making it real
[1375.72 → 1377.38] will cause you
[1377.38 → 1378.68] to re-evaluate
[1378.68 → 1379.40] how you think
[1379.40 → 1380.14] about wealth
[1380.14 → 1381.08] and riches,
[1381.28 → 1381.70] how you think
[1381.70 → 1383.46] about rich and poor.
[1383.60 → 1384.32] Making it real
[1384.32 → 1385.30] will cause us
[1385.30 → 1386.36] to be intentional
[1386.36 → 1387.40] about the language
[1387.40 → 1388.24] we use,
[1388.34 → 1389.84] the way that we speak
[1389.84 → 1390.84] to one another
[1390.84 → 1393.78] and to ourselves.
[1395.16 → 1396.14] Making it real
[1396.14 → 1397.30] will address
[1397.30 → 1398.42] what we think
[1398.42 → 1399.90] is wisdom
[1399.90 → 1401.04] and what is wise
[1401.04 → 1402.40] about what matters
[1402.40 → 1403.50] and how we do it.
[1404.18 → 1404.98] Making it real
[1404.98 → 1406.30] will put in front of us
[1406.30 → 1407.32] the question of humility
[1407.32 → 1408.90] in life or pride.
[1409.48 → 1410.30] Making it real
[1410.30 → 1411.10] will ask us
[1411.10 → 1412.64] to endure suffering.
[1413.04 → 1413.76] Making it real
[1413.76 → 1415.20] will call us
[1415.20 → 1416.50] to think about
[1416.50 → 1417.62] prayer
[1417.62 → 1419.24] and the work
[1419.24 → 1419.56] of God
[1419.56 → 1420.04] in the world.
[1421.88 → 1422.56] James is going
[1422.56 → 1423.02] to take us
[1423.02 → 1423.68] on this journey
[1423.68 → 1424.78] to see that
[1424.78 → 1427.14] God is real,
[1427.26 → 1427.88] that Jesus
[1427.88 → 1429.50] is real
[1429.50 → 1430.40] and that he
[1430.40 → 1431.38] changes
[1431.38 → 1433.02] everything
[1433.02 → 1434.64] about your life.
[1434.64 → 1437.62] I want to share
[1437.62 → 1438.06] with you
[1438.06 → 1439.86] some words
[1439.86 → 1441.26] from a young
[1441.26 → 1441.68] woman.
[1441.76 → 1442.46] Her name is
[1442.46 → 1443.76] Raquel Crow.
[1444.76 → 1445.04] Now,
[1445.54 → 1446.40] these are going
[1446.40 → 1447.10] to be on the screen
[1447.10 → 1447.62] but maybe don't
[1447.62 → 1448.08] put them up
[1448.08 → 1448.66] quite yet.
[1450.32 → 1451.14] Just a little bit
[1451.14 → 1451.76] of an introduction.
[1452.90 → 1453.50] Raquel Crow
[1453.50 → 1454.18] wrote a book
[1454.18 → 1455.24] a few years ago
[1455.24 → 1455.54] called
[1455.54 → 1456.50] This Changes
[1456.50 → 1457.22] Everything.
[1458.80 → 1459.86] Remember I said
[1459.86 → 1460.36] at the beginning
[1460.36 → 1461.10] I shared a little bit
[1461.10 → 1461.72] of my story.
[1461.86 → 1463.12] I was 18,
[1463.22 → 1464.24] 19 years old
[1464.24 → 1465.14] in that time
[1465.14 → 1465.76] of my life.
[1466.84 → 1467.80] Raquel Crow
[1467.80 → 1468.92] wrote what I'm
[1468.92 → 1469.48] about to read
[1469.48 → 1469.86] to you
[1469.86 → 1470.54] when she
[1470.54 → 1471.98] was 18 years old.
[1473.22 → 1474.74] She is 18 years old
[1474.74 → 1475.30] and she
[1475.30 → 1477.68] in this paragraph
[1477.68 → 1478.52] gets it
[1478.52 → 1479.40] more than
[1479.40 → 1481.10] most
[1481.10 → 1482.42] so-called
[1482.42 → 1482.84] mature
[1482.84 → 1483.78] Christian adults
[1483.78 → 1484.80] that I have
[1484.80 → 1485.62] interacted with.
[1486.62 → 1487.78] And I am
[1487.78 → 1489.60] so encouraged
[1489.60 → 1491.76] by young people
[1491.76 → 1493.12] who are
[1493.12 → 1493.98] thinking and
[1493.98 → 1494.34] believing
[1494.34 → 1495.46] this way.
[1495.78 → 1496.40] So let me read
[1496.40 → 1497.24] these words
[1497.24 → 1498.06] to you.
[1498.14 → 1498.64] This is from
[1498.64 → 1499.78] Raquel Crow.
[1499.94 → 1500.40] She writes,
[1500.88 → 1502.02] Jesus changes
[1502.02 → 1503.00] everything
[1503.00 → 1504.30] about a person's
[1504.30 → 1504.72] life.
[1505.10 → 1506.04] From the obvious
[1506.04 → 1507.02] to the unseen.
[1507.02 → 1508.00] He shatters
[1508.00 → 1509.04] black and white
[1509.04 → 1510.02] into brilliant
[1510.02 → 1510.58] colour
[1510.58 → 1512.68] and sacks
[1512.68 → 1513.42] the sleep
[1513.42 → 1514.20] until they
[1514.20 → 1515.00] are wide
[1515.00 → 1515.66] awake.
[1516.34 → 1516.66] Jesus'
[1517.08 → 1517.38] followers
[1517.38 → 1518.12] don't live
[1518.12 → 1518.72] like they did
[1518.72 → 1519.20] before.
[1519.20 → 1520.24] following him.
[1520.34 → 1520.96] We don't talk
[1520.96 → 1521.52] about the same
[1521.52 → 1522.28] things or read
[1522.28 → 1522.92] the same books.
[1523.04 → 1524.28] We no longer
[1524.28 → 1525.22] dress or act
[1525.22 → 1525.88] or think the
[1525.88 → 1526.38] same way.
[1526.70 → 1527.42] Jesus makes
[1527.42 → 1529.04] people 100%
[1529.04 → 1529.58] new.
[1529.72 → 1530.38] He takes the
[1530.38 → 1531.28] spiritually dead
[1531.28 → 1532.00] and makes us
[1532.00 → 1532.68] thrillingly,
[1532.98 → 1533.44] beautifully,
[1533.70 → 1534.62] and abundantly
[1534.62 → 1535.70] alive.
[1538.34 → 1539.12] That's what I
[1539.12 → 1539.70] want for you.
[1541.14 → 1541.90] That's what it
[1541.90 → 1542.56] means to make
[1542.56 → 1543.84] it is real.
[1544.70 → 1545.42] And I am
[1545.42 → 1546.72] so blessed
[1546.72 → 1547.70] when we hear
[1547.70 → 1548.40] stories
[1548.40 → 1550.30] like that.
[1552.36 → 1552.94] I don't know
[1552.94 → 1553.32] how many of you
[1553.32 → 1553.82] had a chance
[1553.82 → 1555.02] to check out
[1555.02 → 1555.88] the real talk
[1555.88 → 1556.70] thing that
[1556.70 → 1557.28] Pastor Kevin
[1557.28 → 1557.68] did.
[1557.68 → 1559.78] And there
[1559.78 → 1560.38] we heard
[1560.38 → 1561.06] from two young
[1561.06 → 1561.78] people in our
[1561.78 → 1562.14] church
[1562.14 → 1563.04] who I would
[1563.04 → 1563.56] put in this
[1563.56 → 1564.06] category.
[1565.06 → 1565.92] People who are
[1565.92 → 1566.98] asking the hard
[1566.98 → 1567.74] questions and who
[1567.74 → 1568.96] are making it
[1568.96 → 1569.64] real.
[1569.64 → 1577.40] just like I
[1577.40 → 1578.72] was and
[1578.72 → 1579.34] continue to
[1579.34 → 1579.82] wrestle with
[1579.82 → 1580.30] what did it
[1580.30 → 1581.44] mean that I
[1581.44 → 1582.10] lived my life
[1582.10 → 1583.56] that way and
[1583.56 → 1584.26] it wasn't real
[1584.26 → 1585.14] and the impact
[1585.14 → 1585.54] that that may
[1585.54 → 1585.96] have had on
[1585.96 → 1586.28] the people
[1586.28 → 1586.92] around me.
[1589.76 → 1590.40] Continue to
[1590.40 → 1590.78] ask that
[1590.78 → 1591.18] question.
[1592.30 → 1592.98] What does it
[1592.98 → 1593.48] mean to live
[1593.48 → 1594.14] my life the
[1594.14 → 1594.58] way that I
[1594.58 → 1595.26] do now and
[1595.26 → 1595.86] what impact
[1595.86 → 1596.52] will it have
[1596.52 → 1597.38] on the people
[1597.38 → 1598.00] around me?
[1598.00 → 1600.30] I think
[1600.30 → 1600.68] about my
[1600.68 → 1601.00] kids.
[1602.20 → 1602.90] My daughter
[1602.90 → 1603.50] who is eight
[1603.50 → 1604.02] years old
[1604.02 → 1605.60] who I hope
[1605.60 → 1606.46] will one day
[1606.46 → 1607.42] sit and have
[1607.42 → 1608.06] the conviction
[1608.06 → 1608.92] that Ruth did
[1608.92 → 1609.54] when she talked
[1609.54 → 1610.22] to Pastor Kevin
[1610.22 → 1610.92] about reading
[1610.92 → 1611.26] the Bible
[1611.26 → 1611.62] with her
[1611.62 → 1612.12] friends and
[1612.12 → 1612.62] about wrestling
[1612.62 → 1613.04] with what it
[1613.04 → 1613.44] means to be
[1613.44 → 1613.82] a follower
[1613.82 → 1614.30] of Jesus.
[1617.06 → 1617.62] But that
[1617.62 → 1618.12] starts with
[1618.12 → 1618.38] me.
[1619.48 → 1619.94] And that
[1619.94 → 1620.32] starts with
[1620.32 → 1620.98] how I live.
[1622.60 → 1622.88] And it
[1622.88 → 1623.28] starts with
[1623.28 → 1624.48] how I am
[1624.48 → 1625.72] convicted and
[1625.72 → 1627.60] changed and
[1627.60 → 1627.84] live a
[1627.84 → 1628.18] compelling
[1628.18 → 1628.62] life.
[1629.88 → 1630.46] And it
[1630.46 → 1630.84] starts with
[1630.84 → 1631.02] you.
[1632.34 → 1632.96] And how
[1632.96 → 1633.46] you live.
[1634.46 → 1634.96] Because the
[1634.96 → 1636.14] reality is that
[1636.14 → 1637.20] Jesus came and
[1637.20 → 1637.98] lived the life
[1637.98 → 1638.74] that I should
[1638.74 → 1639.14] have lived.
[1639.20 → 1639.56] And Jesus
[1639.56 → 1640.40] died the death
[1640.40 → 1640.72] that I
[1640.72 → 1641.02] deserved.
[1641.10 → 1641.84] And in his
[1641.84 → 1642.92] resurrection he
[1642.92 → 1643.84] has won victory
[1643.84 → 1644.74] over sin and
[1644.74 → 1644.94] death.
[1645.20 → 1645.78] And now by
[1645.78 → 1646.60] grace through
[1646.60 → 1647.38] faith he
[1647.38 → 1648.16] grants to
[1648.16 → 1649.24] you all that
[1649.24 → 1651.78] you need to
[1651.78 → 1653.38] be adopted as
[1653.38 → 1653.76] a son or
[1653.76 → 1654.18] daughter of
[1654.18 → 1654.42] God.
[1654.64 → 1655.22] He gives
[1655.22 → 1656.00] you perfect
[1656.00 → 1656.42] righteousness.
[1656.42 → 1657.32] He declares
[1657.32 → 1658.58] you holy.
[1659.86 → 1660.30] He's taken
[1660.30 → 1661.04] from you the
[1661.04 → 1661.64] punishment for
[1661.64 → 1662.42] sin and this
[1662.42 → 1663.76] is the reality
[1663.76 → 1665.00] in which we
[1665.00 → 1666.16] now live.
[1666.26 → 1666.94] And so make
[1666.94 → 1667.54] it is real.
[1669.40 → 1670.28] Live such
[1670.28 → 1671.90] compelling lives
[1671.90 → 1672.72] in the world
[1672.72 → 1673.34] that though they
[1673.34 → 1673.98] might accuse you
[1673.98 → 1674.56] of doing wrong,
[1674.64 → 1675.06] that though they
[1675.06 → 1675.86] might think you
[1675.86 → 1676.52] are weird and
[1676.52 → 1676.98] strange, that
[1676.98 → 1677.42] though you might
[1677.42 → 1678.06] be ostracized,
[1678.14 → 1678.54] that though maybe
[1678.54 → 1679.10] you will lose
[1679.10 → 1679.76] your job, maybe
[1679.76 → 1680.26] you will lose
[1680.26 → 1680.68] your friends,
[1680.94 → 1681.54] live such
[1681.54 → 1682.98] compelling lives
[1682.98 → 1683.60] in the world
[1683.60 → 1684.22] that though they
[1684.22 → 1684.88] accuse you of
[1684.88 → 1685.78] doing wrong, they
[1685.78 → 1686.48] will see your
[1686.48 → 1687.58] good deeds and
[1687.58 → 1689.12] glorify God on
[1689.12 → 1690.18] the day he
[1690.18 → 1691.04] visits.
[1691.66 → 1693.54] Make it real.
[1696.34 → 1697.24] And see what
[1697.24 → 1699.50] God does in
[1699.50 → 1701.68] your life and
[1701.68 → 1702.16] with you.
[1703.20 → 1703.50] Amen?
[1704.62 → 1705.32] Let's pray
[1705.32 → 1705.60] together.
[1705.60 → 1712.18] Lord Jesus, may
[1712.18 → 1714.40] our faith be
[1714.40 → 1715.28] real.
[1715.42 → 1716.50] May our love be
[1716.50 → 1717.86] more than words.
[1718.56 → 1719.20] May what we
[1719.20 → 1721.20] profess with our
[1721.20 → 1723.12] mouth match how
[1723.12 → 1724.94] we live in our
[1724.94 → 1725.78] lifestyles.
[1728.48 → 1731.10] May our lives be
[1731.10 → 1732.56] so compelling,
[1732.56 → 1735.36] so beautiful,
[1736.36 → 1737.54] that the majesty
[1737.54 → 1738.90] of your gospel,
[1739.12 → 1740.06] the beauty of
[1740.06 → 1741.02] your face, Lord
[1741.02 → 1742.36] Jesus, is made
[1742.36 → 1743.76] so abundantly
[1743.76 → 1744.88] clear in all
[1744.88 → 1745.82] that we do and
[1745.82 → 1746.38] in all that we
[1746.38 → 1749.84] say, that people
[1749.84 → 1751.42] will be drawn to
[1751.42 → 1753.88] you through us.
[1755.54 → 1756.68] That our kids
[1756.68 → 1757.68] will be drawn to
[1757.68 → 1759.42] you through us.
[1759.58 → 1760.42] That our neighbours
[1760.42 → 1761.66] will be drawn to
[1761.66 → 1762.72] you through us.
[1762.80 → 1763.58] That our friends
[1763.58 → 1764.88] will be drawn to
[1764.88 → 1765.84] you through us.
[1765.94 → 1766.62] That our brothers
[1766.62 → 1769.28] and sisters will
[1769.28 → 1770.10] be drawn to you
[1770.10 → 1771.38] through us such
[1771.38 → 1772.44] that each and
[1772.44 → 1773.84] every one may
[1773.84 → 1775.08] become for us
[1775.08 → 1776.20] brothers and
[1776.20 → 1778.38] sisters in your
[1778.38 → 1779.44] name.
[1781.44 → 1782.80] In your name
[1782.80 → 1783.56] we pray.
[1785.04 → 1785.42] Amen.
[1785.42 → 1785.54] Amen.
[1787.06 → 1787.82] Amen.
