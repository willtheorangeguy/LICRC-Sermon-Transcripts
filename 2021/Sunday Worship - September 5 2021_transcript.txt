[6.48 --> 16.54]  Full of faith and wonder I will say
[16.54 --> 21.68]  No other name but yours
[21.68 --> 25.14]  Name but yours
[25.14 --> 28.02]  Full of faith and wonder
[28.02 --> 29.84]  I will say
[29.84 --> 34.96]  No other name but yours
[34.96 --> 39.38]  Name but yours
[39.38 --> 49.78]  This name that storms the gates of hell
[49.78 --> 56.28]  The only word my life will live to tell
[56.28 --> 64.60]  On the earth will bow beneath the sun
[64.60 --> 67.14]  Higher than the others
[67.14 --> 71.10]  Higher than the others
[71.10 --> 75.92]  Full of faith and wonder I will say
[75.92 --> 81.46]  No other name but yours
[81.46 --> 84.46]  Name but yours
[84.46 --> 89.92]  Full of faith and wonder I will say

[93.86 --> 97.86]  Name but yours
[97.86 --> 100.78]  Jesus
[100.78 --> 102.78]  Jesus
[102.78 --> 104.74]  Jesus
[104.74 --> 106.74]  Jesus
[106.74 --> 108.86]  Jesus
[108.86 --> 110.86]  Jesus
[110.86 --> 115.24]  Jesus
[115.24 --> 115.60]  Jesus
[115.60 --> 119.74]  Jesus
[119.74 --> 133.10]  There is power in the name of Jesus
[133.10 --> 146.40]  There is power in the name of Jesus
[146.40 --> 159.74]  There is power in the name of Jesus
[159.74 --> 173.74]  There is power in the name of Jesus
[173.74 --> 186.38]  There is power in the name of Jesus
[189.74 --> 199.74]  There is power in the name of Jesus
[199.74 --> 209.74]  No faith and wonder I'll say
[209.74 --> 215.00]  No other name but yours
[215.00 --> 217.74]  Name but yours
[217.74 --> 222.74]  No faith and wonder I'll say
[222.74 --> 227.74]  No other name but yours
[227.74 --> 231.74]  Name but yours
[231.74 --> 233.74]  Jesus
[233.74 --> 235.74]  Jesus
[235.74 --> 239.74]  Jesus
[239.74 --> 241.74]  Jesus
[241.74 --> 243.74]  Jesus
[243.74 --> 247.74]  There is power in the name of Jesus
[247.74 --> 251.74]  Jesus
[251.74 --> 253.74]  Jesus
[253.74 --> 257.74]  There is power in the name of Jesus
[257.74 --> 261.74]  There is power in the name of Jesus
[261.74 --> 267.74]  There is power in the name of Jesus
[267.74 --> 277.74]  There is power in the name of Jesus
[277.74 --> 279.74]  We believe Lord
[279.74 --> 281.74]  There is power in the name of Jesus
[281.74 --> 285.48]  We believe, Lord, we sing.
[285.84 --> 293.12]  There is power in the name of Jesus.
[295.62 --> 297.20]  We declare.
[297.20 --> 306.56]  There is power in the name of Jesus.
[306.56 --> 319.90]  There is power in the name of Jesus.
[336.56 --> 338.56]  Amen.
[366.56 --> 368.56]  Amen.
[396.56 --> 398.32]  It's who I am.
[399.04 --> 401.74]  It's who I am.
[404.64 --> 411.80]  Oh, and I've seen many searching for answers.
[413.02 --> 414.90]  Good morning.
[415.82 --> 417.48]  How's everyone doing this morning?
[417.98 --> 418.48]  Good.
[419.44 --> 420.08]  All right.
[420.20 --> 422.42]  Welcome to church.
[422.52 --> 425.18]  First of all, you can see some things have changed around here.
[425.18 --> 429.94]  There's been a lot of work this week, but we are in the middle of that process.
[430.68 --> 436.34]  And so forgive the in the middle of renovation look that we are here at.
[437.24 --> 438.72]  It'll be this way for a little while.
[438.78 --> 443.94]  We're waiting for carpet, but we are very excited to see some things progressing and happening
[443.94 --> 446.12]  and coming about here.
[446.12 --> 452.98]  So, also, sorry, someone was pointing over here.
[453.02 --> 453.66]  I thought there was a problem.
[455.12 --> 457.14]  Everyone's just impressed with the beautiful lights.
[459.96 --> 461.50]  I would never say that, Kevin.
[461.50 --> 469.02]  If you are visiting with us this morning or if you're participating online for the first time,
[469.08 --> 469.78]  my name is Chris.
[470.00 --> 471.40]  I'm one of the pastors here.
[471.62 --> 477.02]  And along with these people on stage, it's my privilege to lead in worship this morning.
[477.68 --> 482.66]  This morning, we are finishing our teaching series from the summer, and we're going to
[482.66 --> 486.88]  do that a little bit differently with Pastor Kevin and myself on stage, but we'll come to
[486.88 --> 487.28]  that later.
[487.28 --> 493.38]  Before we begin, in earnest, I do want to just say a couple words of announcements and
[493.38 --> 493.88]  thank you.
[493.96 --> 497.90]  First of all, thank you to everyone who was involved in the project this week, who worked
[497.90 --> 499.14]  long and late hours.
[500.42 --> 504.56]  I'm not going to mention them by name because we want them to continue working long and late
[504.56 --> 508.28]  hours for the next few weeks to finish this job, and so then you'll get named and we'll
[508.28 --> 509.48]  celebrate you at that point.
[510.34 --> 515.02]  But we do want to continue and thank God for all the people that he provides for volunteer
[515.02 --> 516.90]  and for leading around here.
[517.28 --> 522.98]  To that end, we are looking for a few more leaders to serve in different capacities.
[523.38 --> 527.48]  And so we are looking for one more leader to serve in children's worship time.
[528.62 --> 533.20]  We have Amy Humerts and Karis Verkaik who have stepped up and are going to share in that
[533.20 --> 536.42]  leading, and we want one more person to work with them.
[536.50 --> 540.02]  And so if you think you can do that or if you'd like to help in that ministry, you can
[540.02 --> 544.72]  talk to either Amy or Karis or myself or Pastor Kevin, and we will get you connected
[544.72 --> 545.12]  in that.
[545.12 --> 550.56]  And as well, we're looking for one more GEMS coordinator or co-coordinator to work with
[550.56 --> 552.58]  Courtney and provide there.
[552.64 --> 556.46]  So if you think that's something you might be able to jump in and do, then we can plug
[556.46 --> 557.34]  you in there as well.
[557.44 --> 561.24]  So again, talk to myself or Pastor Kevin or Courtney, and we'll get you there.
[562.14 --> 566.70]  And then additionally, new this week, we are looking for some new cadet leaders.
[566.70 --> 571.08]  And so cadet is a young boys ministry that we do here.
[571.82 --> 573.66]  Lots of hands-on projects.
[573.80 --> 577.72]  You get to work with power tools and the like, and then also work with seven-year-olds working
[577.72 --> 578.52]  with power tools.
[578.82 --> 581.70]  So it's a great time of high-anxiety ministry.
[582.50 --> 586.34]  But if you're interested in that, talk to myself or Pastor Kevin after service together.
[586.34 --> 592.04]  Also, some of you have seen the announcement that came out in the e-bulletin for Reactivate,
[592.28 --> 597.12]  which is a youth conference that's happening next weekend here in the Lower Mainland at
[597.12 --> 601.66]  Willoughby Church, but it's inviting churches from all over BC to participate.
[602.18 --> 605.28]  They need volunteers, and you can sign up for that in the e-bulletin.
[605.40 --> 607.42]  If you have any questions, Pastor Kevin is your man.
[607.80 --> 608.58]  He will answer them.
[608.58 --> 617.20]  Finally, well, actually, penultimately, tomorrow morning, we are hosting a pancake breakfast
[617.20 --> 617.52]  here.
[618.06 --> 621.42]  So tomorrow morning is Labor Day, and so we want to invite you to rest from your labors
[621.42 --> 623.28]  and allow us to labor for you.
[623.64 --> 628.54]  And so myself and Pastor Kevin and Josh, our young adult ministry intern, we will be cooking
[628.54 --> 634.20]  pancake breakfast for whoever shows up at 9 o'clock till whenever we're done.
[634.86 --> 636.44]  And it'll be here in the foyer.
[636.66 --> 638.52]  Lord willing, we'll be able to be outside in the courtyard.
[638.86 --> 640.50]  And so come and join us for that.
[640.88 --> 642.60]  We're doing this as a fundraiser.
[643.70 --> 650.52]  Part of our ongoing projects here will be replacing the carpet and the chairs in our
[650.52 --> 651.42]  worship space.
[651.42 --> 655.54]  But we need to raise some capital in order to do that well and stewardly.
[655.54 --> 662.78]  And so please come tomorrow, eat as many pancakes as you would like, and generously give as much
[662.78 --> 665.06]  as you would like, or more.
[665.06 --> 670.50]  The sooner we get that done, the sooner we can get the chairs and that project underway.
[670.50 --> 673.76]  Now finally, last announcement.
[673.88 --> 678.18]  Last week, we mistakenly announced that we would be having Lord's Supper this week.
[678.34 --> 679.10]  That's on me.
[679.24 --> 680.34]  I misspoke to the elder.
[680.88 --> 682.08]  Lord's Supper is next week.
[682.08 --> 684.72]  And so you've had a week to prepare your hearts.
[685.14 --> 688.04]  Continue that preparation into this coming week.
[688.04 --> 693.28]  If you have kids who participate, please talk to them about what it means to come to the table.
[693.28 --> 697.40]  And if at any point throughout the week you have any questions about what it means to come to the table,
[697.64 --> 699.86]  you can email or call or connect with me.
[700.10 --> 701.60]  And I'm glad to speak with you as well.
[702.60 --> 703.92]  I think I got them all.
[705.02 --> 707.24]  It's Labor Day weekend, so we got to do lots of work, right?
[707.28 --> 707.92]  That's what that means?
[708.84 --> 709.86]  Let's stand together.
[709.86 --> 716.04]  If you are able, and where you are, we'll be called into worship, and God will welcome us in his presence.
[716.92 --> 719.30]  Receive the greeting of our good God.
[719.30 --> 728.56]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Savior,
[729.32 --> 732.00]  through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[732.62 --> 734.80]  All God's people said, amen.
[735.20 --> 735.90]  Let's sing together.
[738.28 --> 743.54]  Our call to worship this morning comes from the first two verses of Exodus 15.
[744.44 --> 748.30]  I will sing to the Lord, for he is highly exalted.
[748.30 --> 752.74]  Both horse and driver he has hurled into the sea.
[753.34 --> 755.96]  The Lord is my strength and my defense.
[756.48 --> 758.30]  He has become my salvation.
[759.00 --> 761.58]  He is my God, and I will praise him.
[761.96 --> 764.54]  My Father's God, and I will exalt him.
[764.54 --> 764.70]  Amen.
[764.70 --> 791.32]  I cast my line to Calvary, where Jesus bled and died for me.
[791.32 --> 799.66]  I see his wounds, his hands, his feet.
[799.66 --> 806.36]  My Savior, all that cursed and tree.
[806.36 --> 818.58]  His body bowed and drenched in tears.
[818.58 --> 826.08]  They laid him down in Joseph's tomb.
[826.08 --> 833.46]  The entrance sealed by heavy stone.
[833.46 --> 840.42]  Messiah still and all of all.
[840.42 --> 853.56]  Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God.
[853.56 --> 860.56]  Oh, praise his name forevermore.
[860.56 --> 868.66]  For endless days we will sing your praise.
[868.66 --> 875.56]  Oh, Lord, oh, Lord our God.
[875.56 --> 893.24]  And on the earth at break of dawn, the Son of Heaven rose again.
[893.24 --> 896.92]  Oh, trampled death.
[896.92 --> 900.48]  Where is your sting?
[900.48 --> 907.62]  The angel's woe for Christ the King.
[907.62 --> 918.62]  Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God.
[918.62 --> 925.62]  Oh, praise his name forevermore.
[925.62 --> 932.62]  For endless days we will sing your praise.
[932.62 --> 939.62]  Oh, Lord, oh, Lord our God.
[939.62 --> 940.62]  God.
[940.62 --> 950.62]  He shall return in robes of white.
[950.62 --> 958.62]  The blazing sun shall pierce the night.
[958.62 --> 965.62]  And I will rise among the saints.
[965.62 --> 975.62]  My gaze transmits on Jesus' face.
[975.62 --> 981.30]  The in Troy bowl.
[981.30 --> 984.72]  Or read...
[985.04 --> 988.62]  Or read...
[988.62 --> 994.10]  Your, the son of God.
[994.10 --> 1002.58]  Egypt shall pierce the night.
[1002.72 --> 1004.06]  Pay God�im
[1004.06 --> 1013.82]  Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God.
[1013.82 --> 1020.74]  Oh, praise His name forevermore.
[1021.10 --> 1027.56]  For endless days we will sing Your praise.
[1027.94 --> 1033.10]  Oh, Lord, oh, Lord our God.
[1034.06 --> 1041.20]  Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God.
[1041.20 --> 1048.00]  Oh, praise His name forevermore.
[1048.34 --> 1054.20]  For endless days we will sing Your praise.
[1055.18 --> 1060.70]  Oh, Lord, oh, Lord our God.
[1060.70 --> 1067.84]  Oh, Lord, oh, Lord our God.
[1067.84 --> 1074.98]  Oh, Lord, oh, Lord our God.
[1074.98 --> 1076.98]  Oh, Lord our God.
[1076.98 --> 1080.44]  Confession and assurance comes to us from 1 John 1.
[1080.44 --> 1086.08]  This is the message we have from Him and declare to you.
[1086.58 --> 1088.02]  God is light.
[1088.58 --> 1091.54]  In Him there is no darkness at all.
[1092.42 --> 1100.46]  If we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth.
[1100.46 --> 1108.46]  But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another.
[1109.10 --> 1114.62]  And the blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from all sin.
[1114.62 --> 1120.42]  If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves.
[1120.76 --> 1123.26]  And the truth is not in us.
[1123.76 --> 1134.50]  If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.
[1134.50 --> 1149.18]  If we confess our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness, we will forgive us from all unrighteousness.
[1149.44 --> 1153.46]  We will forgive us from all unrighteousness and we will give you without sin.
[1153.46 --> 1154.08]  You give up.
[1154.50 --> 1156.46]  You are love.
[1156.72 --> 1161.40]  You bring life to the darkness.
[1161.40 --> 1165.40]  You give all, you restore
[1165.40 --> 1171.40]  Every heart that is broken
[1171.40 --> 1178.40]  Great are you, Lord
[1178.40 --> 1184.66]  It's your breath in our lungs
[1184.66 --> 1187.86]  So we pour out our praise
[1187.86 --> 1190.02]  We pour out our praise
[1190.02 --> 1194.10]  It's your breath in our lungs
[1194.10 --> 1197.32]  So we pour out our praise
[1197.32 --> 1199.30]  To you only
[1199.30 --> 1210.40]  You give life
[1210.40 --> 1212.64]  You are love
[1212.64 --> 1217.78]  You bring light to the darkness
[1217.78 --> 1221.86]  You give all, you restore
[1221.86 --> 1227.36]  Every heart that is broken
[1227.36 --> 1235.86]  Great are you, Lord
[1235.86 --> 1241.40]  It's your breath in our lungs
[1241.40 --> 1244.56]  So we pour out our praise
[1244.56 --> 1246.78]  We pour out our praise
[1246.78 --> 1250.88]  It's your breath in our lungs
[1250.88 --> 1254.08]  So we pour out our praise
[1254.08 --> 1256.02]  To you only
[1256.02 --> 1260.38]  It's your breath in our lungs
[1260.38 --> 1263.66]  So we pour out our praise
[1263.66 --> 1265.90]  We pour out our praise
[1265.90 --> 1269.78]  It's your breath in our lungs
[1269.78 --> 1273.26]  So we pour out our praise
[1273.26 --> 1275.20]  To you only
[1275.20 --> 1284.78]  And all the earth will shout your praise
[1284.78 --> 1297.36]  And all the earth will shout your praise
[1297.36 --> 1300.86]  Our hearts will cry
[1300.86 --> 1304.00]  These bones will sing
[1304.00 --> 1310.20]  Great are you, Lord
[1310.20 --> 1314.28]  Great are you, Lord
[1314.28 --> 1317.78]  And all the earth will shout your praise
[1317.78 --> 1319.78]  Our hearts will cry
[1319.78 --> 1322.78]  These bones will sing
[1322.78 --> 1328.28]  Great are you, Lord
[1328.28 --> 1337.86]  Great are you, Lord
[1337.86 --> 1338.86]  Great are you, Lord
[1338.86 --> 1339.86]  Our hearts will cry
[1339.86 --> 1340.86]  These bones will sing
[1340.86 --> 1344.86]  Great are you, Lord
[1344.86 --> 1349.86]  Great are you, Lord
[1349.86 --> 1359.44]  And all the earth will shout your praise
[1359.44 --> 1360.38]  God is broken
[1360.38 --> 1362.44]  And all the earth will shout your praise
[1362.44 --> 1367.08]  And all the earth will shout your praise
[1367.08 --> 1371.38]  To you only
[1371.38 --> 1372.94]  It's your breath in our lungs
[1372.94 --> 1377.08]  So we pour out our praise
[1377.08 --> 1381.46]  We pour out our praise, we pour out our praise.
[1381.52 --> 1385.60]  It's your bread in our lives.
[1386.14 --> 1391.08]  So we pour out our praise to you only.
[1407.08 --> 1409.08]  Amen.
[1437.08 --> 1439.08]  Amen.
[1467.08 --> 1469.08]  Amen.
[1497.08 --> 1499.08]  Amen.
[1499.08 --> 1500.08]  Amen.
[1500.08 --> 1501.08]  Amen.
[1501.08 --> 1502.08]  Amen.
[1502.08 --> 1508.08]  I am our God Almighty.
[1508.08 --> 1512.08]  Worthy as the Lamb.
[1512.08 --> 1516.08]  Worthy as the Lamb.
[1516.08 --> 1522.08]  Amen.
[1522.08 --> 1527.08]  Hallelujah.
[1527.08 --> 1529.08]  Hallelujah.
[1529.08 --> 1536.08]  Hallelujah.
[1536.08 --> 1541.08]  For the Lord our right to raise.
[1541.08 --> 1546.08]  Hallelujah.
[1546.08 --> 1551.08]  Hallelujah.
[1551.08 --> 1556.84]  For the Lord God Almighty raised
[1556.84 --> 1562.32]  Alleluia
[1562.32 --> 1569.58]  Glory, glory
[1569.58 --> 1575.96]  The Lord God Almighty
[1575.96 --> 1580.54]  Worthy as a man
[1580.54 --> 1583.34]  Worthy as a man
[1583.34 --> 1586.32]  For you are holy
[1586.32 --> 1590.04]  Holy
[1590.04 --> 1596.98]  Are you, Lord God Almighty?
[1599.12 --> 1601.84]  Worthy as a man
[1601.84 --> 1604.46]  Worthy as a man
[1604.46 --> 1607.34]  For you are holy
[1607.34 --> 1611.12]  Holy
[1611.12 --> 1618.12]  Are you, Lord God Almighty?
[1620.26 --> 1623.32]  Worthy as a man

[1626.28 --> 1629.02]  Amen
[1629.02 --> 1636.74]  You may have a seat
[1636.74 --> 1650.52]  Good morning
[1650.52 --> 1657.12]  Now is the opportunity for us to show Christ's love to others with the giving of our tithes and offerings
[1657.12 --> 1661.06]  Today's offerings are for our church's budget and for New Ground
[1661.06 --> 1672.88]  New Ground, formerly Operation Manna, is a program of the Diagonal Ministry Canada that helps churches across Canada reach beyond their walls and into their communities to show Christ's love
[1672.88 --> 1683.02]  With the New Ground partnership churches receive coaching and seed money so that they can establish sustainable local ministries where it may not have been possible
[1683.02 --> 1688.06]  When you give to New Ground, it's not just another offering to another cause
[1688.06 --> 1691.34]  It's about the people who you reach out to through your gift
[1691.34 --> 1696.38]  From John 13 verse 34 to 35, Jesus says
[1696.38 --> 1699.88]  A new command I give you, love one another
[1699.88 --> 1703.76]  As I have loved you, so you must love one another
[1703.76 --> 1709.04]  By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another
[1709.04 --> 1715.48]  Please refer to the church e-bulletin for the various options available to give to today's offerings
[1715.48 --> 1720.32]  It's also important to remember that we use only one collection bag during the service
[1720.32 --> 1725.84]  Anything not clearly marked budget will be automatically allocated towards the special offering
[1725.84 --> 1731.70]  Should you require offering envelopes, please ask one of the deacons and they will be placed in your mailbox
[1731.70 --> 1736.14]  Any questions for any of the deacons, we are here to help
[1736.14 --> 1740.90]  Next week's offering is for Resonate Global Missions
[1740.90 --> 1741.90]  Please give generously
[1766.14 --> 1772.90]  Spirit of the Living God
[1772.90 --> 1776.90]  Spirit of the Living God

[1851.68 --> 1854.40]  It changes what we see
[1854.40 --> 1856.50]  And what we see

[1912.52 --> 1916.44]  Cause when you speak and when you move

[1924.26 --> 1926.34]  What we see
[1926.34 --> 1930.34]  When you come in the room

[1933.68 --> 1938.24]  It changes us, it changes what we see
[1938.24 --> 1940.48]  What we see
[1940.48 --> 1946.48]  When you move, you move all our fears
[1946.48 --> 1958.48]  When you move, you move all our fears
[1958.48 --> 1965.48]  When you move, you move us to tears
[1965.48 --> 1971.48]  When you move, you move all our fears
[1971.48 --> 1979.48]  When you move, you move us to tears
[1979.48 --> 1986.48]  And when you fall, we fall on our knees
[1986.48 --> 1993.48]  When you fall, we fall at your knees
[1993.48 --> 2000.48]  When you fall, we fall at your knees

[2006.48 --> 2010.48]  When you fall, we fall at your knees
[2010.48 --> 2011.48]  When you fall, upon your knees
[2011.48 --> 2021.78]  And when you move, when you do what only you can do, it changes us, it changes what we see.
[2022.18 --> 2035.66]  And what we see when you come and move, when you do what only you can do, it changes us, it changes what we see.

[2041.48 --> 2066.28]  Spirit of the living God, Spirit of the living God, we only want to hear your voice, we're hanging on every word.
[2071.48 --> 2081.46]  I'm going to invite the kids who are going to head out to Children's Worship Time to come up here so we can send them out with a blessing.
[2082.80 --> 2088.74]  So I think that's like three to kindergarten or something like that for those who are going to Children's Worship Time.
[2088.80 --> 2093.22]  But every other kid or young at heart, you can come on up and we'll give you a blessing as well.
[2093.22 --> 2101.02]  Awesome. It's so good to see all you guys. How are you doing?
[2102.22 --> 2105.88]  So I have a really important question for you. Who's ready for school on Tuesday?

[2113.30 --> 2116.94]  How about parents? Should I ask you? Who's ready for school on Tuesday?
[2116.94 --> 2122.86]  None? Oh, okay. Three, four, one of you who's not.
[2123.94 --> 2125.94]  They're not even in school anymore. I know.
[2127.86 --> 2129.68]  So you guys are going to head, yeah?
[2131.26 --> 2133.82]  When I'm five, I will go to kindergarten.
[2134.04 --> 2137.98]  When you're five, you will go to kindergarten. You know what? I loved kindergarten.
[2138.82 --> 2140.08]  That was so much fun.
[2140.08 --> 2146.08]  It's been a long time since I've been in kindergarten. Yeah, thanks. Appreciate that.
[2148.78 --> 2155.80]  Well, with that on our hearts and minds, we're going to pray for you as you guys head out to Children's Worship Time.
[2155.86 --> 2159.00]  And then after I pray for you, we're going to do the blessing.
[2159.14 --> 2160.10]  You remember how we do that?
[2160.10 --> 2166.04]  We're going to stand up and we're going to face all the others here and we're going to say, the Lord be with you.
[2166.18 --> 2170.78]  And then they're going to say, and also with you. Right?
[2171.20 --> 2173.86]  Okay. I think they know how to do that, but we'll see when we get there.
[2173.92 --> 2175.60]  Can I pray for you? Let's pray.
[2178.80 --> 2182.82]  Good God, we come to you now in this prayer.
[2182.88 --> 2185.54]  And we pray for our kids.
[2185.54 --> 2192.34]  We pray for these little hearts as they go into Children's Worship or as they sit here with us.
[2192.54 --> 2194.84]  May you work in them.
[2195.86 --> 2197.22]  May they see you, Jesus.
[2198.32 --> 2199.60]  May they know your love.
[2201.30 --> 2207.70]  May they grow in faith here with us as we come together as a church.
[2209.06 --> 2211.12]  Bless and keep their worship.

[2221.40 --> 2225.00]  And then all y'all can stand and you don't have to turn around.
[2226.76 --> 2230.06]  We're going to hold our hands out and then together we will say,
[2231.18 --> 2233.34]  The Lord be with you.
[2234.02 --> 2235.74]  And also with you.
[2236.08 --> 2236.52]  Amen.

[2582.68 --> 2597.36]  Noah are doing their thing.
[2597.36 --> 2600.12]  Just right here.
[2600.12 --> 2601.12]  Yep.
[2601.12 --> 2613.12]  I just want to take a moment really and say, do you ever have one of those weeks where
[2613.12 --> 2615.12]  like you just need Sunday to be good?
[2615.12 --> 2616.12]  Right?
[2616.12 --> 2619.92]  You've had one of those weeks where you're just like grinding through and nothing seems
[2619.92 --> 2623.96]  to be working or adding up the way you want it and you're just praying that Lord meet me
[2623.96 --> 2624.96]  on Sunday.
[2624.96 --> 2629.18]  Well, I want to say that God's met me here on Sunday because of you and I think you guys
[2629.18 --> 2629.96]  are singing great.
[2629.96 --> 2635.14]  The team is doing really good work and so I'm just grateful to God to be here with you and
[2635.14 --> 2636.08]  to participate in that.
[2636.20 --> 2637.54]  I needed that after this week.
[2637.68 --> 2643.18]  I hope at least one or two of you are experiencing the same and so thank you for letting me be part
[2643.18 --> 2646.54]  of that and coming into this space with you together.
[2648.14 --> 2649.50]  With that said, there's a chair.
[2649.50 --> 2659.18]  So as many of you know and have been participating in with us this summer, we have been doing
[2659.18 --> 2665.22]  a series that we've called Ask Anything that started with people submitting questions and
[2665.22 --> 2670.46]  then throughout the summer, myself and Kevin and Josh have taken those questions on and
[2670.46 --> 2671.68]  provided answers to them.
[2671.68 --> 2679.52]  This is the final Sunday of that series and what we've done for today is kind of taken
[2679.52 --> 2686.20]  four or five questions that didn't make it into the didn't make the cut for its own service
[2686.20 --> 2691.20]  but ones that we can answer in three or four or maybe seven minutes.
[2691.20 --> 2692.80]  And so we've piled a bunch together.
[2692.80 --> 2697.28]  There's not necessarily any connection or order between them but we really did want
[2697.28 --> 2701.76]  to try to make sure that we answered as many questions as we could that were submitted to
[2701.76 --> 2702.02]  us.
[2702.12 --> 2707.04]  And so Kevin is going to sort of facilitate that although there will be a little bit
[2707.04 --> 2710.64]  of conversation back and forth and I'll ask him to answer a couple things.
[2712.34 --> 2718.68]  And then so we are going to kind of finish up in this way and so hopefully your question
[2718.68 --> 2723.14]  has been addressed that you submitted for the summer and I know that more questions have
[2723.14 --> 2729.84]  popped up that is in part by design but also I know that some of you want further answers
[2729.84 --> 2734.56]  and so I'm going to make myself available and I'm telling Kevin now that he's going to make
[2734.56 --> 2740.58]  himself available and so if you have more questions or you want to talk or follow up let us know
[2740.58 --> 2745.82]  and we'll have coffee and we'll sit down and we'll see what we can do in that regard.
[2745.82 --> 2748.58]  I do also want to say thank you for participating this summer.
[2748.70 --> 2753.92]  It's been a lot of fun for me and I hope it's been edifying for you as we've addressed some
[2753.92 --> 2755.48]  of these questions together.
[2756.30 --> 2759.76]  So Kevin, why don't you start us with a question or four?
[2759.98 --> 2760.12]  Yeah.
[2760.34 --> 2762.82]  So like we didn't test my microphone so thanks Matt.
[2762.90 --> 2763.40]  That was quick.
[2763.56 --> 2763.96]  We're good.
[2764.64 --> 2766.38]  I come in hot all the time.
[2767.04 --> 2770.30]  We're going to call these lightning rounds even though that's a bit of a misnomer because
[2770.30 --> 2774.18]  these might not go like quick but we're going to we got five lightning rounds of questions.
[2774.18 --> 2776.14]  Sometimes there's two or three questions per round.
[2776.72 --> 2778.50]  So let's get started with number one.
[2778.60 --> 2779.38]  It's a three-parter.
[2779.74 --> 2782.58]  Pastor Chris, where did we get the Bible from?
[2782.70 --> 2783.58]  When was it written?
[2785.16 --> 2785.44]  Right.
[2785.58 --> 2790.76]  So this, I guess this question has a long answer and a short answer.
[2790.88 --> 2792.18]  I'll give you a medium answer.
[2792.52 --> 2792.74]  Fair.
[2793.10 --> 2793.42]  Excellent.
[2793.90 --> 2798.76]  We could get into questions about text criticism or source criticism or redaction criticism.
[2798.76 --> 2801.86]  We don't need to get into the weeds of all of that.
[2801.98 --> 2808.10]  Suffice it to say that there's really good and strong arguments and reasons to agree with
[2808.10 --> 2813.50]  or to hold what's generally considered to be the traditional understanding of authorship
[2813.50 --> 2814.70]  and dating and the like.
[2815.64 --> 2820.16]  But sort of starting from the beginning of the Bible, the Pentateuch, that's the first
[2820.16 --> 2821.66]  five books of the Bible.
[2821.66 --> 2826.22]  We generally know to have been authored by Moses.
[2826.44 --> 2831.18]  Now there are obviously parts of the Pentateuch that Moses didn't write.
[2831.98 --> 2834.88]  Like he probably didn't record his own death, for instance.
[2835.46 --> 2843.18]  And so there are redactors or editors or people who have come along after that and added things
[2843.18 --> 2844.00]  into the text.
[2844.00 --> 2850.82]  But that period of history where Moses is alive and living is somewhere in the vicinity of
[2850.82 --> 2853.74]  1500 BC to 1100 BC.
[2853.98 --> 2856.76]  And I know that that's a wide span of years.
[2857.82 --> 2862.14]  But that's in part because in the last 30 years or so, there's been some archaeological
[2862.14 --> 2868.62]  evidence that challenges when the exodus actually took place, which is a fascinating thing to
[2868.62 --> 2869.06]  get into.
[2869.26 --> 2873.68]  And if you're into Egyptology or archaeology, I can give you some resources on checking that
[2873.68 --> 2873.82]  out.
[2873.86 --> 2877.48]  But it's a really cool thing to think about and to learn about.
[2877.54 --> 2879.52]  But generally in that time frame.
[2880.42 --> 2885.40]  Moving forward from there, you get into the section of the Old Testament that's generally
[2885.40 --> 2886.88]  referred to as the histories.
[2887.70 --> 2892.30]  And those books could have been authored by their so-called titular authors, i.e.
[2892.32 --> 2896.30]  Joshua could have wrote and Joshua, Ezra, Nehemiah could have been written by Ezra or
[2896.30 --> 2896.68]  Nehemiah.
[2897.00 --> 2901.20]  What's more likely, however, is that those were written by a court historian.
[2901.20 --> 2909.92]  Somebody is part of the either temple system or the royal court system who's recording the
[2909.92 --> 2911.18]  history of the people.
[2911.34 --> 2915.04]  And that would have happened in sort of either a pre-exile time.
[2915.16 --> 2921.58]  So before Israel was carried off by the Babylonians into exile in 586 BC or after.
[2921.58 --> 2928.66]  And a good example of that, the books of Kings and Chronicles generally record the same sorts
[2928.66 --> 2934.14]  of events, but they have a different sort of theological purpose behind why they are written.
[2934.52 --> 2937.50]  And so Kings was likely written before the exile.
[2938.00 --> 2943.02]  Chronicles was likely written after the exile as the people of Israel are trying to re-establish
[2943.02 --> 2944.42]  their royal kingdom.
[2944.42 --> 2947.04]  Then you get the wisdom literature.
[2948.48 --> 2951.58]  Most of that was probably penned by David or by Solomon.
[2952.04 --> 2957.44]  The Psalms, some very clearly identify being as of David or the sons of Korah, which is
[2957.44 --> 2959.42]  a priestly class who were served in the temple.
[2960.72 --> 2963.16]  And then you have a lot of books that don't name authors.
[2964.08 --> 2967.72]  Ecclesiastes, for instance, Tradition says, was authored by Solomon.
[2967.72 --> 2971.74]  Solomon, though there's reason to believe that that was written later than Solomon himself,
[2971.86 --> 2973.58]  but in the tradition of Solomon.
[2974.44 --> 2979.60]  And so the teacher, who is referred to in Ecclesiastes in Hebrew, is called Kohelet.
[2979.96 --> 2981.50]  That's the Hebrew word for the teacher.
[2982.02 --> 2985.90]  And so often people will say Ecclesiastes is authored by Kohelet, the teacher.
[2986.74 --> 2991.36]  But that would be, again, in that sort of time either of the individual referred to.
[2991.44 --> 2994.00]  So David obviously wrote the Psalms when he was alive.
[2994.00 --> 2998.36]  And Isaiah likewise prophesied when he was alive.
[2998.80 --> 3005.74]  The prophets are doing their ministry from the 8th century BC with Isaiah down to Malachi
[3005.74 --> 3008.54]  around 300 BC.
[3009.52 --> 3012.60]  And then the New Testament was written in the 1st century.
[3013.52 --> 3015.66]  We don't need to get into further details on all of those.
[3016.14 --> 3016.58]  That makes sense.
[3017.24 --> 3021.52]  So knowing all of that, how did then all of those different authors, when those books
[3021.52 --> 3023.72]  were all written throughout history, how did we get this?
[3023.72 --> 3029.16]  How did we get all of those chapters, all of those authors, all of those books into the
[3029.16 --> 3030.96]  Bible that we hold now in our hands?
[3031.28 --> 3031.38]  Yeah.
[3033.20 --> 3037.34]  Again, so I will say we could dig really deep into some of this stuff.
[3037.42 --> 3040.18]  I'm a history nerd, particularly a church history nerd.
[3040.28 --> 3041.94]  And so I geek out on this kind of thing.
[3041.94 --> 3045.16]  I will give you a gloss history.
[3045.38 --> 3048.06]  If you want to follow up, grab me and we can have more conversation.
[3048.80 --> 3054.70]  First of all, I want to say sort of as a rule for understanding or a principle for understanding
[3054.70 --> 3060.68]  that when we talk about the Bible, particularly the Bible that we hold up here, we're talking
[3060.68 --> 3062.36]  about the canon of Scripture.
[3062.36 --> 3067.82]  And so that refers to the collection of writings that we recognize as authoritative or as the
[3067.82 --> 3069.80]  voice of God to his people.
[3070.60 --> 3074.18]  Now, this canon was discerned.
[3075.04 --> 3081.00]  The Old Testament or the Hebrew Bible, the canon was fixed and set by about the third century
[3081.00 --> 3081.52]  B.C.
[3081.52 --> 3087.08]  And then the New Testament canon, it is the letters and the Gospels in the New Testament,
[3087.80 --> 3093.72]  was officially discerned by the Synod of Hippo in 393 A.D.
[3093.78 --> 3098.14]  It was reconfirmed by the Ecumenical Council of Carthage in 397.
[3098.86 --> 3100.70]  But I want to say two things here.
[3100.78 --> 3104.38]  One, it's important that you hear me use the word discerned, right?
[3104.38 --> 3111.22]  So the church has discerned which books are authoritative.
[3111.22 --> 3114.34]  They haven't decided which books are authoritative.
[3114.44 --> 3118.20]  And that's a very important distinction because it's not like a group of people with a will
[3118.20 --> 3122.36]  to power, to use the Nietzschean phrase, came together and said, these particular letters
[3122.36 --> 3128.46]  affirm our desire to be in control and to support the patriarchy or whatever language you want
[3128.46 --> 3128.78]  to use.
[3129.46 --> 3131.56]  And so we will elevate them.
[3132.12 --> 3138.62]  Instead, they came together and prayerfully, with fasting, discerned which books spoke the
[3138.62 --> 3140.56]  voice of God to his church.
[3141.22 --> 3149.10]  And the official lists that were approved or recognized in the end of the fourth century
[3149.10 --> 3159.02]  were as early as 140 A.D. in the response to Marcion's heresy at 180 A.D. with Irenaeus.
[3159.02 --> 3166.68]  It's a recognition of books that have been long identified as authoritative.
[3167.68 --> 3168.84]  In fact, F.F.
[3168.90 --> 3170.58]  Bruce is a Bible scholar.
[3171.40 --> 3176.96]  He says that when at last a church council listed the 27 books of the New Testament, it
[3176.96 --> 3182.58]  did not confer upon them an authority which they already did not possess, but simply recorded
[3182.58 --> 3185.28]  their previously established canonicity.
[3185.28 --> 3192.48]  And so what that means is there are certain qualifiers for something being canonical.
[3192.48 --> 3197.02]  There are certain checks that are boxes that have to be checked in order for people to
[3197.02 --> 3202.04]  realize that this belongs as part of the revealed will of God.
[3202.14 --> 3207.00]  And so for the New Testament letters, those rules were Catholicity.
[3207.00 --> 3211.26]  Catholicity, which that Catholicity means like applicable to the whole church.
[3211.84 --> 3211.98]  Yep.
[3212.06 --> 3214.52]  And used around the known church at the time.
[3215.60 --> 3216.00]  Antiquity.
[3216.34 --> 3217.06]  How old it was.
[3218.64 --> 3219.04]  Orthodoxy.
[3219.16 --> 3219.98]  How correct it was.
[3220.76 --> 3222.88]  Well, how consistent it was with what we knew to be true.
[3222.98 --> 3223.10]  Yeah.
[3223.82 --> 3226.62]  Especially in the doctrines of Christ as a test case.
[3226.88 --> 3228.42]  And apostolicity.
[3228.74 --> 3230.40]  Relating to the apostles.
[3230.40 --> 3231.16]  Very good.
[3231.86 --> 3237.48]  And so in Acts 2, 42, for instance, it says that the church in Jerusalem continues the teaching
[3237.48 --> 3238.30]  of the apostles.
[3238.82 --> 3238.96]  Right?
[3239.00 --> 3243.06]  So it's not necessarily the case that the apostles wrote all of those books.
[3243.12 --> 3245.12]  So for the vast majority of them, that is the case.
[3245.22 --> 3248.30]  But it's the teaching of the apostles that continues.
[3249.12 --> 3254.64]  Now, just really quickly, the Bible that you hold in your hands as such, formatted in the
[3254.64 --> 3257.66]  way that it is, has its own history.
[3258.28 --> 3258.46]  Right?
[3258.50 --> 3263.66]  And so the Pentateuch and the histories, we referred to those earlier, they were divided
[3263.66 --> 3266.44]  out into chapters, loosely termed.
[3267.36 --> 3270.80]  Really, it was meant large sections for memorization.
[3271.22 --> 3272.28]  But that wasn't standardized.
[3272.28 --> 3274.90]  But that had already happened by the 6th century BC.
[3275.68 --> 3281.98]  The prophets, continuing in the Old Testament, were divided out into, again, chapters, but for
[3281.98 --> 3286.72]  memorization by 165 BC, and also not standardized.
[3287.68 --> 3289.74]  In the New Testament, same thing.
[3290.34 --> 3296.40]  The chapter divisions, or some divisions, appear to be recorded in the publication industry
[3296.40 --> 3298.36]  around 250 BC.
[3298.56 --> 3303.34]  But these, in the New Testament, aren't standardized until the 3rd century AD.
[3303.78 --> 3305.64]  Sorry, I think I said BC there when I meant AD.
[3306.42 --> 3306.98]  We're tracking.
[3306.98 --> 3312.84]  And then the verse markings in the Old Testament were standardized around 900 AD.
[3313.10 --> 3317.58]  And then the verse markings in the New Testament, which we have and are generally the same.
[3317.64 --> 3320.54]  You notice that when you pick up translations of the Bible, it doesn't really matter which
[3320.54 --> 3320.72]  one.
[3320.78 --> 3322.82]  The verses are generally the same.
[3323.16 --> 3325.42]  That was standardized around the 16th century.
[3326.16 --> 3327.66]  And that's connected to two things.
[3327.76 --> 3332.98]  One, connected to publication of the King James Bible, but also connected to the reinvigoration
[3332.98 --> 3337.80]  of the study of the New Testament that's happening at that time because of the Reformation.
[3338.50 --> 3344.16]  And you have scholars and Bible theologians from all over the place debating which verses
[3344.16 --> 3346.00]  of their correct interpretation of what.
[3346.08 --> 3350.48]  And so they need to be able to say, well, I'm talking about Galatians 3.23, for instance,
[3350.86 --> 3351.80]  and that all be the same.
[3352.30 --> 3356.76]  And so that standardization happens there because these conversations are happening.
[3356.76 --> 3362.60]  And as well, the printing press is standardizing the way things are published, too.
[3363.58 --> 3367.22]  So the Bible's been written over centuries by different authors.
[3368.88 --> 3371.32]  After Christ, it's standardized.
[3371.66 --> 3372.18]  It's put together.
[3372.30 --> 3372.86]  It's discerned.
[3372.92 --> 3374.44]  It's canonized.
[3374.68 --> 3375.18]  Canonized.
[3375.24 --> 3375.72]  That's the word.
[3376.00 --> 3376.52]  And then...
[3376.52 --> 3377.64]  It's recognized as canon.
[3379.32 --> 3380.30]  Is it trustworthy?
[3381.26 --> 3382.58]  Is the Bible trustworthy?
[3382.58 --> 3388.62]  Can we take all of that history that you've just listed, and can we trust that this is the word of God?
[3388.80 --> 3389.14]  Absolutely.
[3390.50 --> 3392.48]  And so this is a really important question.
[3393.40 --> 3397.06]  And to answer it, I want to break it actually into two categories.
[3397.58 --> 3400.42]  And so I want to answer the question of, one, is the Bible reliable?
[3401.20 --> 3403.04]  And then two, is the Bible trustworthy?
[3404.66 --> 3407.26]  The question of, is the Bible reliable, is important.
[3407.26 --> 3414.90]  Because you will have people and certain critical scholars who will look at that history of translation,
[3415.36 --> 3421.70]  who will look at that history and say it's impossible that the Bible could accurately reflect what the original authors wrote,
[3421.80 --> 3424.00]  or there's corruptions all over the place.
[3425.42 --> 3427.46]  And so that's really a question of reliability.
[3427.46 --> 3441.94]  And so is what we have here a reliable representation or transmission of what the original authors or redactors had intended?
[3443.08 --> 3447.70]  And I think the evidence for that is overwhelmingly yes.
[3447.70 --> 3458.10]  And so really quickly, the way that this source criticism works or text history,
[3458.18 --> 3459.52]  and I know I said we wouldn't get into that,
[3459.82 --> 3463.76]  but it looks at the old translations and how many of them we have,
[3464.18 --> 3466.40]  and then compares them one to the other.
[3466.40 --> 3473.20]  And so for the New Testament, we have over 25,000 early manuscripts.
[3473.86 --> 3476.86]  5,000 of them, over 5,000 of them, are Greek,
[3477.18 --> 3481.04]  and from the first few centuries after Christ.
[3481.72 --> 3483.98]  We have over 10,000, which are Latin,
[3484.42 --> 3489.04]  and then over 10,000 others, which are in different languages as translations.
[3489.04 --> 3496.98]  And so that is a huge amount of source material to be able to work back and discern the reliability.
[3497.56 --> 3502.80]  By way of comparison, some of you have heard or read Homer's Iliad.
[3503.74 --> 3511.46]  Homer's Iliad was written around the 7th or 8th century B.C., or sometime in that span.
[3511.84 --> 3517.32]  It's speculated that it was a poem that was transmitted orally for many centuries before that.
[3517.32 --> 3523.70]  But for Homer's Iliad, we currently have only 643 manuscripts.
[3525.10 --> 3531.10]  And the earliest full manuscript that we have for Homer's Iliad is from the 13th century A.D.
[3531.62 --> 3534.88]  This is almost 2,000 years removed from the source text.
[3535.74 --> 3538.92]  When it comes to the New Testament, we have over 25,000,
[3539.22 --> 3543.80]  and some of them are only less than 100 years removed from the source text.
[3543.80 --> 3549.58]  And so Daniel Wallace, who's a New Testament scholar and into this sort of text criticism thing,
[3549.98 --> 3554.26]  he says that based on the sheer volume of manuscripts that we have,
[3554.62 --> 3562.58]  we can be sure, certain, that we have at least 99.8% accuracy to the autograph,
[3562.90 --> 3565.66]  to what's the first author's writing.
[3565.66 --> 3571.88]  And then he goes on to say where we do see that 0.2% of discrepancy, it's in minor areas.
[3572.16 --> 3576.24]  It's in things not affecting one iota of doctrine for the church.
[3576.84 --> 3582.34]  But it's in whether or not a scribe, you know, dotted their I or someplace like that.
[3583.36 --> 3590.18]  And so overwhelmingly, right, the evidence says that the New Testament is reliable.
[3590.18 --> 3594.64]  Whether or not it's trustworthy is a different question,
[3595.08 --> 3598.08]  and it's a really important question.
[3599.04 --> 3605.64]  Now, the Scriptures, as trustworthy, requires something else to be true.
[3606.44 --> 3607.98]  Namely, it requires the Holy Spirit.
[3609.04 --> 3612.80]  And so the Heidelberg Catechism defines faith, in part,
[3612.80 --> 3618.08]  as a wholehearted trust which the Holy Spirit creates in me by the gospel.
[3618.08 --> 3627.04]  The trustworthiness of the Bible is dependent upon the Holy Spirit revealing and opening it up
[3627.04 --> 3633.96]  for your heart and for your life and for the Holy Spirit applying Scripture to transform you, right?
[3634.12 --> 3636.52]  When God speaks, things happen.
[3636.66 --> 3637.74]  Think of the creation story.
[3637.84 --> 3640.62]  God said, let there be light, and there was light.
[3641.68 --> 3643.78]  That was a good one for you.
[3643.78 --> 3647.34]  When God speaks, things happen, right?
[3647.42 --> 3652.50]  Isaiah 55, God says that His Word goes out and will not return to Him without accomplishing
[3652.50 --> 3653.80]  that for which He sent it.
[3654.68 --> 3656.30]  The Holy Spirit does that work.
[3657.04 --> 3661.16]  Now, I also want to be really clear, because someone who doesn't believe in the trustworthiness
[3661.16 --> 3663.48]  of the Scriptures or the reliability of the Scriptures will say,
[3663.82 --> 3666.20]  well, that's a circular argument, right?
[3666.20 --> 3670.38]  You're saying that the Bible is trustworthy because the Bible says it's trustworthy.
[3672.42 --> 3676.96]  And I want to respond and say, well, no, it's not a circular argument or it's not a cop-out
[3676.96 --> 3680.06]  if the Holy Spirit is real, right?
[3680.08 --> 3685.04]  If the Holy Spirit genuinely has agency in our lives in applying the gift of faith,
[3685.20 --> 3689.28]  then it's not a cop-out because the Holy Spirit is what makes the difference.
[3689.28 --> 3695.60]  And so the Bible is not only reliable, but it is ultimately trustworthy.
[3696.60 --> 3701.36]  But for it to be trustworthy, we need to allow the Holy Spirit to speak and to move in our hearts.
[3703.56 --> 3705.94]  And so, real quick takeaway.
[3707.70 --> 3713.04]  The Bible is 66 books authored by 40 different people,
[3713.04 --> 3716.64]  the writing of which spans 1,500 years,
[3716.96 --> 3719.28]  takes place over three different continents,
[3719.64 --> 3722.90]  but it is one story.
[3724.22 --> 3725.34]  By way of comparison,
[3726.34 --> 3728.68]  not only am I a church history and a Bible nerd,
[3728.76 --> 3730.52]  I'm also a Marvel movie nerd.
[3731.62 --> 3734.50]  And so the MCU, the Marvel Cinematic Universe,
[3734.62 --> 3736.92]  is 24 movies, three TV shows,
[3737.36 --> 3739.66]  some shorts in there as well,
[3739.66 --> 3741.18]  over 13 years,
[3741.30 --> 3743.38]  starting in 2008 with Iron Man 1,
[3743.58 --> 3746.56]  but it tells one story.
[3748.26 --> 3751.74]  Saw the penultimate climax of that in Endgame,
[3751.88 --> 3754.08]  and now we're into the next phase.
[3754.94 --> 3756.54]  The Bible does the same thing.
[3757.54 --> 3758.80]  It tells one story,
[3759.04 --> 3762.16]  and that story is revealing Jesus Christ.
[3763.02 --> 3764.58]  Genesis is about Jesus,
[3764.80 --> 3766.38]  Exodus is about Jesus,
[3767.26 --> 3768.84]  Isaiah is about Jesus,
[3768.84 --> 3770.64]  Jeremiah is about Jesus,
[3770.84 --> 3774.10]  Amos, Joel, and Malachi are all about Jesus.
[3775.14 --> 3776.52]  The Gideon Bibles,
[3777.26 --> 3780.12]  which for generations have been placed in hotel rooms
[3780.12 --> 3781.62]  around North America and the world,
[3781.92 --> 3783.32]  has a little paragraph in the beginning
[3783.32 --> 3784.88]  that describes the Bible saying,
[3785.12 --> 3786.76]  Christ is its grand subject,
[3787.34 --> 3788.88]  our good is its design,
[3789.10 --> 3791.96]  and the glory of God is its end.
[3793.32 --> 3794.82]  The Bible is reliable,
[3795.12 --> 3796.04]  and it is trustworthy.
[3796.04 --> 3799.88]  It is the voice of God for our faith,
[3800.50 --> 3802.30]  and you can hang your hat on that.
[3803.26 --> 3803.70]  Amen.
[3804.64 --> 3807.32]  So, that's lightning round one.
[3808.00 --> 3809.88]  More like a long rolling thunder.
[3809.98 --> 3810.92]  We'll call them thunder rounds.
[3811.24 --> 3812.40]  That's thunder round one,
[3812.78 --> 3814.08]  but I think we all need to stand up for a second.
[3814.16 --> 3814.74]  Everybody stand up.
[3815.04 --> 3815.98]  Up, quick, quick, quick.
[3816.34 --> 3816.66]  Stretch.
[3816.92 --> 3817.24]  The back.
[3817.34 --> 3817.54]  Turn.
[3817.76 --> 3818.26]  This turn.
[3818.50 --> 3818.70]  Up.
[3819.18 --> 3819.78]  This way.
[3820.00 --> 3820.54]  Okay, sit down.
[3821.34 --> 3822.30]  Thunder round two.
[3822.30 --> 3825.78]  Moving on.
[3827.58 --> 3829.38]  What do you do with your anger
[3829.38 --> 3831.40]  if you are angry with God
[3831.40 --> 3833.38]  or if you are angry at God?
[3834.42 --> 3835.66]  What do you do with your anger?
[3836.02 --> 3836.14]  Yeah.
[3837.60 --> 3838.56]  And so, again,
[3838.64 --> 3842.02]  I think this is a really important question,
[3842.48 --> 3844.12]  and I think it's important
[3844.12 --> 3848.02]  because sometimes I think we've been,
[3848.30 --> 3848.92]  as Christians,
[3849.04 --> 3850.50]  we've been misled on this,
[3850.50 --> 3852.32]  and so let me start by simply saying
[3852.32 --> 3855.12]  that Ephesians 4, verse 26 says,
[3855.52 --> 3857.24]  in your anger do not sin.
[3859.16 --> 3859.82]  And so, hear that.
[3859.98 --> 3861.56]  In your anger do not sin.
[3862.72 --> 3864.90]  So often we are told
[3864.90 --> 3867.74]  that being angry is itself a sin.
[3869.02 --> 3870.28]  What the Scriptures are saying
[3870.28 --> 3872.98]  is that what you do with your anger,
[3873.44 --> 3876.16]  how you respond in your anger,
[3876.38 --> 3878.78]  is where sin may creep in.
[3878.78 --> 3881.88]  And so the real question is,
[3882.44 --> 3885.36]  how do we be angry at God
[3885.36 --> 3886.82]  in the right way?
[3888.44 --> 3889.28]  Now, let me, again,
[3889.44 --> 3890.76]  be really clear here
[3890.76 --> 3893.46]  because some of us can take that
[3893.46 --> 3896.82]  and have license to abuse that reality,
[3897.02 --> 3898.28]  but look at the Scriptures.
[3899.40 --> 3899.48]  Right?
[3899.58 --> 3903.10]  The psalmists are excellent examples at this.
[3903.52 --> 3903.66]  Right?
[3903.66 --> 3905.90]  You can read the book of Psalms
[3905.90 --> 3908.54]  and find a number of different people
[3908.54 --> 3909.12]  and authors
[3909.12 --> 3911.34]  who express their anger
[3911.34 --> 3913.30]  at what's going on around them,
[3913.36 --> 3915.04]  but also their anger at God.
[3916.06 --> 3916.18]  Right?
[3916.28 --> 3917.64]  Psalm 13,
[3917.78 --> 3919.04]  how long, O Lord,
[3919.10 --> 3920.16]  will you forget me forever?
[3921.50 --> 3921.68]  Right?
[3921.72 --> 3924.88]  That's not a passive experience of God.
[3924.96 --> 3927.38]  That's not a calm engagement
[3927.38 --> 3929.74]  with the reality of God's presence
[3929.74 --> 3931.54]  or his lack of experience in that.
[3931.54 --> 3932.56]  My God, my God,
[3932.62 --> 3934.16]  why have you forsaken me?
[3934.64 --> 3935.28]  Psalm 22.
[3936.40 --> 3936.56]  Right?
[3936.58 --> 3937.56]  Psalm 42, right?
[3937.78 --> 3939.42]  Deep cries out to deep.
[3939.76 --> 3939.90]  Right?
[3939.92 --> 3941.16]  Your waves and your breakers
[3941.16 --> 3941.92]  are washing over me.
[3942.06 --> 3942.88]  These are people
[3942.88 --> 3945.28]  who are genuinely experiencing anger
[3945.28 --> 3946.64]  at what's going on
[3946.64 --> 3948.54]  and anger at God.
[3948.64 --> 3950.62]  And in case you're not clear on this,
[3950.76 --> 3953.16]  Job 7, verse 11,
[3953.30 --> 3953.76]  Job says,
[3954.12 --> 3956.28]  therefore I will not keep silent.
[3956.42 --> 3957.68]  I will speak out
[3957.68 --> 3960.12]  in the anguish of my spirit.
[3960.24 --> 3961.36]  I will complain
[3961.36 --> 3964.04]  in the bitterness of my soul.
[3967.20 --> 3970.04]  Job complains to God.
[3970.38 --> 3971.90]  He gets angry at God.
[3971.96 --> 3972.88]  Or another one
[3972.88 --> 3975.06]  from Jeremiah.
[3975.90 --> 3977.42]  I'm going to read a couple verses here.
[3977.50 --> 3978.40]  Jeremiah 15.
[3979.40 --> 3980.94]  Jeremiah is crying out,
[3981.26 --> 3981.44]  saying,
[3981.52 --> 3982.80]  Lord, you understand.
[3983.18 --> 3984.60]  Remember me and care for me.
[3984.82 --> 3986.46]  Avenge me on my prosecutors.
[3986.46 --> 3988.48]  You are long-suffering.
[3988.56 --> 3989.60]  Do not take me away.
[3989.90 --> 3991.40]  Think of how I suffer reproach
[3991.40 --> 3992.22]  for your sake.
[3992.84 --> 3993.82]  When your words came,
[3993.90 --> 3994.44]  I ate them.
[3994.74 --> 3995.44]  They were my joy
[3995.44 --> 3996.20]  and my heart's delight.
[3996.44 --> 3997.62]  For I bear your name,
[3997.76 --> 3998.56]  Lord God Almighty.
[3999.10 --> 4000.82]  I never sat in the company
[4000.82 --> 4001.52]  of revelers,
[4001.60 --> 4002.82]  never made merry with them.
[4003.02 --> 4003.94]  I sat alone
[4003.94 --> 4005.54]  because your hand was on me.
[4005.90 --> 4006.84]  You had filled me
[4006.84 --> 4007.76]  with indignation.
[4008.04 --> 4008.94]  And then hear this, right?
[4008.98 --> 4009.84]  This is Jeremiah saying,
[4010.08 --> 4011.16]  I've done all things right.
[4011.16 --> 4015.44]  Why is my pain unending
[4015.44 --> 4017.74]  and my wound grievous
[4017.74 --> 4018.80]  and incurable?
[4018.96 --> 4019.96]  And here's what he says to God.
[4020.30 --> 4021.56]  You are to me
[4021.56 --> 4023.84]  like a deceptive brook,
[4024.62 --> 4026.90]  a spring that fails.
[4029.70 --> 4030.86]  That's anger
[4030.86 --> 4033.38]  at his experience of God.
[4034.62 --> 4035.14]  Right?
[4035.18 --> 4036.66]  The example here,
[4037.04 --> 4038.24]  the right way to deal
[4038.24 --> 4039.66]  with your anger at God
[4039.66 --> 4042.36]  is to bring it to God.
[4043.36 --> 4044.54]  It's to come to him
[4044.54 --> 4045.76]  with the genuineness
[4045.76 --> 4046.80]  and the authenticness
[4046.80 --> 4048.56]  of your emotions.
[4049.52 --> 4050.78]  And we can do that
[4050.78 --> 4052.90]  precisely because of who God is.
[4053.40 --> 4054.32]  We can do that
[4054.32 --> 4056.62]  clinging to the sovereignty
[4056.62 --> 4057.78]  of God
[4057.78 --> 4059.66]  and his covenant promises,
[4060.22 --> 4062.04]  his covenant identity.
[4063.86 --> 4064.90]  Earlier, actually,
[4065.02 --> 4066.66]  when Frank was praying,
[4066.66 --> 4068.64]  he prayed through Psalm 29
[4068.64 --> 4069.46]  and he said that
[4069.46 --> 4071.28]  the Lord rules over the flood,
[4071.38 --> 4074.06]  the Lord sits enthroned forever.
[4074.94 --> 4076.68]  That's the sovereignty of God.
[4077.70 --> 4077.86]  Right?
[4077.90 --> 4079.24]  That's the rule of God
[4079.24 --> 4080.30]  over all creation.
[4080.80 --> 4082.24]  The catechism says that
[4082.24 --> 4084.86]  not a hair can fall from my head
[4084.86 --> 4087.12]  without the will of my Father in heaven.
[4087.86 --> 4089.06]  And when we really believe
[4089.06 --> 4090.34]  that that's who God is,
[4090.46 --> 4091.80]  even when we are angry,
[4092.06 --> 4092.92]  we will come to him.
[4092.92 --> 4095.62]  And we will cling to
[4095.62 --> 4097.72]  the covenant promises of God.
[4097.78 --> 4098.42]  We will cling to
[4098.42 --> 4100.86]  the covenant identity of God.
[4101.62 --> 4103.10]  Again, covenant identity.
[4103.48 --> 4105.60]  Psalm 46 is another great place to go.
[4105.70 --> 4105.80]  Right?
[4105.86 --> 4106.34]  We read that
[4106.34 --> 4108.86]  God is our refuge and strength,
[4108.96 --> 4111.18]  an ever-present help in trouble.
[4111.76 --> 4114.30]  This is the covenant identity of God.
[4114.36 --> 4115.80]  This is the ever-present
[4115.80 --> 4117.80]  refuge and strength.
[4117.90 --> 4119.38]  And in Exodus 34,
[4119.38 --> 4120.98]  Moses sees God
[4120.98 --> 4121.68]  and he knows that
[4121.68 --> 4122.68]  it's the Lord, the Lord,
[4122.74 --> 4124.36]  the compassionate and gracious God,
[4124.48 --> 4125.26]  slow to anger,
[4125.40 --> 4126.84]  abounding in love and faithfulness,
[4127.24 --> 4128.58]  maintaining love to thousands,
[4128.84 --> 4130.18]  and forgiving wickedness
[4130.18 --> 4131.24]  and rebellion and sin.
[4131.48 --> 4133.32]  This is our God.
[4134.92 --> 4135.86]  But what do we do
[4135.86 --> 4137.62]  when it doesn't feel that way?
[4139.12 --> 4140.36]  Or when God doesn't feel
[4140.36 --> 4142.02]  like he's slow to anger
[4142.02 --> 4142.98]  or abounding in love?
[4143.00 --> 4144.24]  When we can experience that,
[4144.28 --> 4144.92]  when our experience
[4144.92 --> 4146.52]  is more like Psalm 13.
[4146.98 --> 4147.12]  Right?
[4147.18 --> 4148.08]  How long, O Lord,
[4148.26 --> 4149.26]  will you forget me forever?
[4149.38 --> 4153.68]  Even when we don't feel it,
[4154.36 --> 4155.46]  the truth is,
[4155.54 --> 4158.38]  God is still that Psalm 46,
[4158.72 --> 4160.00]  Isaiah 34,
[4160.86 --> 4162.12]  Psalm 29,
[4162.72 --> 4163.10]  God.
[4163.82 --> 4165.00]  And so in our anger,
[4165.22 --> 4166.58]  we must cling to
[4166.58 --> 4169.08]  the covenant identity
[4169.08 --> 4170.66]  of who God is.
[4172.64 --> 4173.48]  But what about you?
[4173.90 --> 4175.00]  You teach the catechism.
[4175.44 --> 4176.34]  Does that have anything
[4176.34 --> 4177.24]  to say about this?
[4177.24 --> 4178.22]  He asks,
[4178.38 --> 4179.22]  throwing a softball,
[4179.30 --> 4180.00]  but really a test
[4180.00 --> 4180.84]  to see if you can hit it
[4180.84 --> 4181.20]  out of the park
[4181.20 --> 4182.22]  and show off how awesome you are?
[4182.22 --> 4183.34]  Well, technically,
[4183.82 --> 4185.38]  Nick Coline teaches the catechism.
[4185.52 --> 4185.88]  So Nick,
[4186.68 --> 4187.00]  what's,
[4187.06 --> 4187.18]  no,
[4187.24 --> 4187.90]  he's saying,
[4187.98 --> 4188.22]  no, go.
[4188.88 --> 4190.72]  Lord's Day 9,
[4191.16 --> 4192.22]  question and answer 26,
[4192.88 --> 4193.98]  talking about clinging
[4193.98 --> 4194.80]  to the identity,
[4194.94 --> 4196.16]  the covenantal identity
[4196.16 --> 4196.82]  of God.
[4197.22 --> 4198.12]  Lord's Day 9,
[4198.52 --> 4199.26]  question and answer 26,
[4199.26 --> 4199.94]  says,
[4200.08 --> 4201.02]  I trust God,
[4201.62 --> 4202.38]  so we,
[4202.58 --> 4203.96]  I trust God so much
[4203.96 --> 4205.30]  that I do not doubt
[4205.30 --> 4206.02]  he will provide
[4206.02 --> 4206.78]  whatever I need
[4206.78 --> 4207.70]  for body and soul
[4207.70 --> 4209.08]  and will turn my good
[4209.08 --> 4209.84]  whatever adversity
[4209.84 --> 4210.92]  he sends upon me
[4210.92 --> 4211.76]  in this sad world.
[4212.18 --> 4213.72]  God is able to do this
[4213.72 --> 4215.80]  because he is almighty God
[4215.80 --> 4218.06]  and he desires to do this
[4218.06 --> 4219.80]  because he is a faithful father.
[4221.18 --> 4222.54]  So in the midst of our anger,
[4222.76 --> 4224.26]  we need to remember
[4224.26 --> 4226.46]  and cling to this identity of God.
[4226.46 --> 4228.24]  Now, all of that said,
[4228.68 --> 4230.72]  we can undergird this conversation
[4230.72 --> 4232.12]  with the theological truths
[4232.12 --> 4232.60]  from scripture
[4232.60 --> 4233.50]  that you just mentioned,
[4233.56 --> 4235.02]  the catechism that I just read.
[4237.02 --> 4237.86]  Undergirding that,
[4237.98 --> 4238.14]  though,
[4238.20 --> 4239.12]  with that theology,
[4239.98 --> 4241.00]  it's still hard
[4241.00 --> 4241.56]  when we're angry
[4241.56 --> 4242.36]  and there's probably people
[4242.36 --> 4243.34]  sitting out here right now
[4243.34 --> 4244.44]  that are angry at God.
[4244.54 --> 4245.82]  So while that is all true
[4245.82 --> 4247.52]  and we need to have that posture
[4247.52 --> 4248.92]  or that stance,
[4249.80 --> 4251.52]  it still sometimes seems
[4251.52 --> 4252.28]  like it isn't true.
[4252.48 --> 4253.70]  So then what do we do then?
[4254.00 --> 4254.84]  What do we do,
[4254.84 --> 4256.56]  how would you sum up
[4256.56 --> 4257.52]  the catechism of the scriptures
[4257.52 --> 4258.28]  to people who are angry
[4258.28 --> 4259.04]  with God right now?
[4259.32 --> 4259.44]  Yeah.
[4262.74 --> 4263.14]  So,
[4264.34 --> 4267.34]  the truth,
[4267.46 --> 4268.16]  the reality is
[4268.16 --> 4270.24]  that if we want a God
[4270.24 --> 4271.22]  who's big enough
[4271.22 --> 4272.68]  to be angry at
[4272.68 --> 4273.96]  when things go wrong,
[4275.14 --> 4276.10]  that same God
[4276.10 --> 4277.54]  will also be big enough
[4277.54 --> 4278.38]  to have reasons
[4278.38 --> 4280.16]  that we can't understand.
[4280.16 --> 4282.72]  And so if you want
[4282.72 --> 4283.38]  to be angry,
[4284.14 --> 4284.80]  be angry,
[4285.20 --> 4286.00]  please,
[4286.10 --> 4286.98]  and express that,
[4287.14 --> 4287.28]  right?
[4287.30 --> 4288.12]  The scriptures give us
[4288.12 --> 4289.36]  license and voice
[4289.36 --> 4290.28]  to express that.
[4292.76 --> 4293.56]  But know
[4293.56 --> 4295.44]  that God has his reasons
[4295.44 --> 4296.26]  and his purposes
[4296.26 --> 4297.06]  and they may be
[4297.06 --> 4298.38]  beyond our understanding.
[4298.48 --> 4299.80]  My ways are not your ways.
[4299.92 --> 4300.72]  My thoughts are not
[4300.72 --> 4301.28]  your thoughts.
[4302.22 --> 4303.24]  And I don't offer that
[4303.24 --> 4303.92]  as a cop-out
[4303.92 --> 4306.68]  because I think
[4306.68 --> 4307.42]  the reality
[4307.42 --> 4309.32]  of that experience
[4309.32 --> 4310.54]  has to be lived
[4310.54 --> 4311.60]  in community
[4311.60 --> 4314.26]  and that we are
[4314.26 --> 4315.54]  together in this.
[4315.66 --> 4317.00]  I've referenced
[4317.00 --> 4317.98]  previously
[4317.98 --> 4319.34]  a quote from
[4319.34 --> 4320.26]  Dietrich Bonhoeffer
[4320.26 --> 4320.70]  who says,
[4320.92 --> 4322.18]  the Christ in the heart
[4322.18 --> 4322.64]  of another
[4322.64 --> 4323.42]  is stronger than
[4323.42 --> 4325.44]  the Christ in my own heart.
[4325.90 --> 4326.58]  And what that means
[4326.58 --> 4327.48]  is I need people
[4327.48 --> 4328.58]  to speak the truths
[4328.58 --> 4329.14]  of God
[4329.14 --> 4330.10]  and his sovereign power
[4330.10 --> 4331.10]  and his covenant identity
[4331.10 --> 4332.16]  into my life
[4332.16 --> 4334.76]  when I don't feel it.
[4335.40 --> 4336.10]  I know we'll come back
[4336.10 --> 4336.62]  to this theme
[4336.62 --> 4337.96]  in a different question.
[4341.08 --> 4342.14]  But suffering
[4342.14 --> 4343.80]  and struggling,
[4344.68 --> 4344.82]  right,
[4344.90 --> 4345.24]  circumstances
[4345.24 --> 4346.46]  that make us angry
[4346.46 --> 4349.58]  are only meaningful
[4349.58 --> 4351.44]  if God is sovereign
[4351.44 --> 4352.02]  over them.
[4353.24 --> 4354.64]  If God isn't sovereign
[4354.64 --> 4355.56]  and doesn't know
[4355.56 --> 4356.12]  what's coming
[4356.12 --> 4356.70]  or happening,
[4357.18 --> 4358.06]  that means he's not
[4358.06 --> 4359.70]  working those things
[4359.70 --> 4360.58]  to his end.
[4361.10 --> 4361.70]  For our good
[4361.70 --> 4362.62]  and his glory.
[4363.36 --> 4364.88]  Only when he is sovereign
[4364.88 --> 4366.20]  can we find meaning
[4366.20 --> 4367.30]  and purpose
[4367.30 --> 4368.34]  in them.
[4369.36 --> 4369.62]  Awesome.
[4370.08 --> 4371.12]  So take that little note
[4371.12 --> 4371.62]  on community,
[4371.78 --> 4372.42]  file that away,
[4372.56 --> 4373.18]  back of the head.
[4373.26 --> 4373.74]  We're coming back
[4373.74 --> 4374.36]  to that soon
[4374.36 --> 4374.86]  in one of these
[4374.86 --> 4375.60]  other Thunder Rounds.
[4376.10 --> 4376.82]  But there's no break.
[4376.88 --> 4377.28]  We're moving to
[4377.28 --> 4377.96]  Thunder Round 3.
[4378.52 --> 4379.96]  Thunder Round 3 says
[4379.96 --> 4381.40]  or asks this question.
[4382.24 --> 4383.16]  Just simply,
[4384.00 --> 4384.90]  how is Christianity
[4384.90 --> 4385.64]  different
[4385.64 --> 4387.12]  than other world religions?
[4387.12 --> 4389.38]  Yeah,
[4389.52 --> 4390.86]  and so keeping
[4390.86 --> 4392.06]  this simple
[4392.06 --> 4392.56]  without doing
[4392.56 --> 4393.94]  comparative religion
[4393.94 --> 4394.50]  up here,
[4394.74 --> 4395.68]  I'm going to borrow
[4395.68 --> 4396.44]  a distinction
[4396.44 --> 4398.62]  that Tim Keller makes
[4398.62 --> 4400.44]  and he talks about
[4400.44 --> 4401.22]  religion,
[4401.86 --> 4402.56]  irreligion,
[4402.90 --> 4403.58]  and the gospel.
[4404.72 --> 4405.66]  And so religion,
[4406.18 --> 4407.08]  sort of fundamentally
[4407.08 --> 4407.74]  defined,
[4407.90 --> 4409.06]  is the idea of
[4409.06 --> 4410.16]  do this
[4410.16 --> 4411.22]  and God
[4411.22 --> 4412.08]  or the divine
[4412.08 --> 4414.00]  or whatever reward
[4414.00 --> 4415.56]  will be given to you.
[4415.56 --> 4416.68]  And so you've got to
[4416.68 --> 4417.66]  work your way up
[4417.66 --> 4418.40]  and earn
[4418.40 --> 4420.40]  your gift
[4420.40 --> 4421.78]  from the God
[4421.78 --> 4423.46]  or earn your way
[4423.46 --> 4424.46]  into nirvana
[4424.46 --> 4425.10]  or whatever
[4425.10 --> 4427.74]  end goal
[4427.74 --> 4429.28]  is brought there.
[4429.40 --> 4429.76]  And when you say
[4429.76 --> 4430.14]  religion,
[4430.24 --> 4430.84]  we're talking like
[4430.84 --> 4431.84]  that's world religion
[4431.84 --> 4432.62]  across the board.
[4432.74 --> 4432.82]  Yeah,
[4432.92 --> 4433.38]  religion,
[4434.02 --> 4435.42]  the religious identity.
[4436.98 --> 4437.58]  Irreligion
[4437.58 --> 4438.80]  is sort of the opposite,
[4439.36 --> 4439.50]  right?
[4439.56 --> 4441.00]  Irreligion is indifference
[4441.00 --> 4442.26]  or hostility to religion
[4442.26 --> 4443.38]  or it's a lack
[4443.38 --> 4444.92]  of religious belief.
[4444.92 --> 4447.22]  And so there are some
[4447.22 --> 4448.08]  who might say,
[4448.18 --> 4448.64]  for instance,
[4448.76 --> 4450.84]  in the modern secular West
[4450.84 --> 4452.12]  we are skewing more
[4452.12 --> 4452.82]  irreligious
[4452.82 --> 4453.80]  than we are religious,
[4453.92 --> 4455.22]  although that can also be
[4455.22 --> 4456.02]  up for debate.
[4457.54 --> 4459.08]  And then you have gospel.
[4460.20 --> 4460.72]  And Christianity,
[4461.20 --> 4461.68]  of course,
[4461.78 --> 4463.00]  is gospel
[4463.00 --> 4463.80]  because Christianity
[4463.80 --> 4465.32]  is not about
[4465.32 --> 4465.92]  do this
[4465.92 --> 4467.34]  and you will get to God.
[4467.50 --> 4468.24]  Christianity, rather,
[4468.32 --> 4470.52]  is how God came to us,
[4471.34 --> 4471.56]  right?
[4471.62 --> 4473.14]  Christianity is Jesus
[4473.14 --> 4473.96]  living the life
[4473.96 --> 4474.54]  I should have lived
[4474.54 --> 4475.30]  and dying the death
[4475.30 --> 4475.92]  that I deserved.
[4476.06 --> 4477.94]  Christianity is God
[4477.94 --> 4479.68]  doing what I could not
[4479.68 --> 4481.30]  out of his great love
[4481.30 --> 4482.36]  for us.
[4482.88 --> 4483.78]  And so God,
[4484.06 --> 4484.98]  quite literally,
[4485.26 --> 4486.16]  writes himself
[4486.16 --> 4487.58]  into the story
[4487.58 --> 4490.86]  that he has created
[4490.86 --> 4491.50]  and has written.
[4491.76 --> 4492.12]  There's actually
[4492.12 --> 4493.26]  a great illustration
[4493.26 --> 4494.92]  for this point.
[4496.24 --> 4497.30]  Dorothy Sayers.
[4497.70 --> 4498.40]  Dorothy Sayers
[4498.40 --> 4499.36]  was born in the late
[4499.36 --> 4500.20]  19th century
[4500.20 --> 4500.96]  and she wrote
[4500.96 --> 4502.44]  in the early 20th century.
[4502.44 --> 4503.90]  She was one of the first
[4503.90 --> 4505.22]  women to study
[4505.22 --> 4506.58]  at Oxford in England
[4506.58 --> 4508.16]  and she was the writer
[4508.16 --> 4509.74]  of detective fiction.
[4510.16 --> 4510.86]  She wrote a series
[4510.86 --> 4512.20]  of stories and novels
[4512.20 --> 4512.64]  called
[4512.64 --> 4513.86]  The Lord Peter
[4513.86 --> 4515.32]  Whimsey Stories.
[4516.16 --> 4516.80]  Now, Lord Peter
[4516.80 --> 4518.20]  was an aristocratic
[4518.20 --> 4518.84]  detective.
[4519.46 --> 4520.24]  He was single
[4520.24 --> 4521.50]  and lonely.
[4522.52 --> 4523.26]  And in the middle
[4523.26 --> 4524.10]  of the series
[4524.10 --> 4524.96]  of books,
[4525.64 --> 4526.30]  a tall,
[4526.56 --> 4527.60]  not particularly
[4527.60 --> 4528.68]  attractive woman
[4528.68 --> 4529.86]  named Harriet Vane
[4529.86 --> 4531.74]  appears in the stories.
[4532.46 --> 4533.52]  Now, Harriet's character
[4533.52 --> 4534.48]  is,
[4534.84 --> 4536.04]  in the world
[4536.04 --> 4537.64]  of Lord Peter Whimsey,
[4537.86 --> 4538.92]  one of the first women
[4538.92 --> 4539.68]  to go to Oxford
[4539.68 --> 4541.36]  and she is a writer
[4541.36 --> 4542.34]  of detective fiction.
[4543.16 --> 4544.06]  In the stories,
[4544.20 --> 4544.70]  she and Peter
[4544.70 --> 4545.44]  fall in love
[4545.44 --> 4546.08]  and they get married
[4546.08 --> 4546.76]  and they solve
[4546.76 --> 4547.62]  mysteries together.
[4549.00 --> 4550.12]  Now, what's going on?
[4550.84 --> 4550.96]  Right?
[4551.58 --> 4552.82]  Dorothy Sayers
[4552.82 --> 4554.24]  looked at the world
[4554.24 --> 4555.04]  she created
[4555.04 --> 4556.06]  in her novels,
[4556.52 --> 4557.54]  at the character
[4557.54 --> 4558.34]  she created
[4558.34 --> 4559.88]  in Lord Peter Whimsey
[4559.88 --> 4562.62]  and saw his pain
[4562.62 --> 4563.94]  and loneliness
[4563.94 --> 4565.34]  and fell in love
[4565.34 --> 4565.74]  with him.
[4566.20 --> 4566.44]  And so,
[4566.54 --> 4567.52]  she wrote herself
[4567.52 --> 4569.80]  into that story.
[4570.18 --> 4570.94]  She wrote herself
[4570.94 --> 4571.90]  into the world
[4571.90 --> 4573.04]  that she created.
[4573.26 --> 4574.14]  That's the gospel.
[4574.78 --> 4574.88]  Right?
[4574.94 --> 4575.22]  That's what,
[4575.26 --> 4576.66]  that's what God did.
[4576.76 --> 4577.92]  He created this world
[4577.92 --> 4579.90]  and loved us
[4579.90 --> 4580.98]  in it so much
[4580.98 --> 4582.06]  that he wrote himself
[4582.06 --> 4583.14]  into the story
[4583.14 --> 4583.76]  that he came
[4583.76 --> 4584.72]  in Jesus Christ
[4584.72 --> 4585.76]  taking on the very nature
[4585.76 --> 4586.38]  of a slave
[4586.38 --> 4587.44]  and being found
[4587.44 --> 4588.04]  in obedience
[4588.04 --> 4588.78]  became obedient
[4588.78 --> 4589.38]  unto death,
[4589.48 --> 4590.14]  even death
[4590.14 --> 4591.20]  on a cross.
[4591.92 --> 4593.00]  That's what God did.
[4594.12 --> 4594.56]  Likewise,
[4594.70 --> 4595.62]  Christianity is unique
[4595.62 --> 4596.52]  because of the Bible.
[4597.22 --> 4597.44]  Right?
[4597.52 --> 4598.60]  The Bible is
[4598.60 --> 4599.88]  actually unique
[4599.88 --> 4601.72]  among the sacred books
[4601.72 --> 4602.84]  of the world's religions
[4602.84 --> 4603.70]  in that,
[4603.90 --> 4605.08]  in it,
[4605.18 --> 4606.42]  the whole history
[4606.42 --> 4607.64]  of the world
[4607.64 --> 4608.74]  and the structure
[4608.74 --> 4609.58]  of the world
[4609.58 --> 4610.56]  is revealed.
[4612.24 --> 4612.64]  Actually,
[4612.66 --> 4612.98]  why don't you
[4612.98 --> 4614.10]  pick up on that
[4614.10 --> 4614.44]  because I know
[4614.44 --> 4615.06]  you have a thing here?
[4615.20 --> 4615.32]  Well,
[4615.36 --> 4615.74]  I think,
[4616.14 --> 4616.78]  I think
[4616.78 --> 4618.12]  Christianity's
[4618.12 --> 4619.28]  rootedness in history
[4619.28 --> 4620.90]  is such a massive difference
[4620.90 --> 4621.88]  compared to other
[4621.88 --> 4622.46]  world religions
[4622.46 --> 4623.06]  is what sets
[4623.06 --> 4624.10]  Christianity apart.
[4625.54 --> 4626.38]  Christianity is just,
[4626.46 --> 4627.80]  it's rooted in history.
[4627.94 --> 4628.56]  It's easily
[4628.56 --> 4629.12]  the most,
[4629.12 --> 4630.54]  most falsifiable
[4630.54 --> 4631.56]  religion
[4631.56 --> 4632.54]  in the world.
[4632.66 --> 4633.32]  Falsifiable means
[4633.32 --> 4634.56]  it's the easiest religion
[4634.56 --> 4635.34]  to prove wrong.
[4635.70 --> 4636.56]  Christianity is
[4636.56 --> 4637.34]  because of that,
[4637.36 --> 4638.40]  because it roots itself
[4638.40 --> 4639.32]  in history.
[4640.12 --> 4641.76]  Its central claims,
[4641.76 --> 4642.58]  the fact that Jesus
[4642.58 --> 4644.16]  lived and died
[4644.16 --> 4645.12]  and rose again,
[4645.28 --> 4645.86]  they're historical.
[4646.16 --> 4646.90]  No other religion
[4646.90 --> 4647.34]  does this.
[4647.54 --> 4648.02]  Islam,
[4648.16 --> 4648.78]  you have to trust
[4648.78 --> 4650.26]  in a private dream
[4650.26 --> 4651.26]  that Muhammad had
[4651.26 --> 4651.90]  and just trust
[4651.90 --> 4652.68]  in that dream
[4652.68 --> 4654.26]  as the central claim
[4654.26 --> 4654.78]  to Islam.
[4655.60 --> 4656.34]  Jehovah's Witnesses,
[4656.40 --> 4656.92]  the same thing
[4656.92 --> 4657.74]  but with Joseph Smith.
[4657.82 --> 4658.34]  You have to trust
[4658.34 --> 4658.90]  his dreams
[4658.90 --> 4659.82]  and his visions
[4659.82 --> 4660.64]  and you can't
[4660.64 --> 4661.56]  historically test
[4661.56 --> 4662.20]  those things.
[4662.74 --> 4664.52]  Buddhism and Hinduism,
[4664.76 --> 4665.72]  they're not historic
[4665.72 --> 4667.14]  faiths, right?
[4667.24 --> 4668.88]  They don't have
[4668.88 --> 4669.46]  any claims
[4669.46 --> 4670.16]  central to their
[4670.16 --> 4671.00]  belief system
[4671.00 --> 4671.68]  that are rooted
[4671.68 --> 4672.50]  in history.
[4672.96 --> 4674.08]  You either adopt
[4674.08 --> 4674.86]  their philosophies,
[4674.98 --> 4675.66]  adopt their way
[4675.66 --> 4676.20]  of life
[4676.20 --> 4677.20]  or you don't.
[4677.36 --> 4678.66]  You can't test
[4678.66 --> 4679.92]  that against history.
[4680.42 --> 4681.26]  If you make your way
[4681.26 --> 4682.32]  through all of the religions
[4682.32 --> 4683.00]  in the world,
[4683.12 --> 4684.72]  this theme rings true.
[4684.86 --> 4685.82]  Either there's
[4685.82 --> 4687.10]  no historic details
[4687.10 --> 4689.48]  given to its central event,
[4689.54 --> 4690.48]  to the central themes,
[4690.52 --> 4691.32]  to the central cogs
[4691.32 --> 4691.82]  of that religion
[4691.82 --> 4692.80]  or there's no historic
[4692.80 --> 4694.72]  events which form
[4694.72 --> 4695.36]  the foundation
[4695.36 --> 4696.88]  of the faith.
[4697.44 --> 4698.52]  There's this really cool guy,
[4698.58 --> 4699.64]  his name's Michael Payton.
[4699.64 --> 4702.68]  He wrote a few notes on this.
[4702.74 --> 4703.36]  He points this out
[4703.36 --> 4703.90]  very nicely
[4703.90 --> 4704.96]  and he uses this example
[4704.96 --> 4707.14]  which I have now rewritten
[4707.14 --> 4708.62]  to make it more applicable
[4708.62 --> 4709.58]  to us here in Canada.
[4710.10 --> 4710.68]  He says this.
[4710.74 --> 4711.02]  He says,
[4711.42 --> 4712.56]  if I decided to start
[4712.56 --> 4713.04]  a religion,
[4713.38 --> 4714.50]  deceptively or not,
[4715.04 --> 4715.70]  so whether I'm trying
[4715.70 --> 4716.68]  to deceive people or not,
[4716.72 --> 4717.74]  if I decided to start
[4717.74 --> 4718.36]  a new religion,
[4718.66 --> 4719.62]  I would not make
[4719.62 --> 4720.50]  false claims
[4720.50 --> 4722.38]  to recent historic events
[4722.38 --> 4723.12]  that didn't happen
[4723.12 --> 4724.42]  because I know
[4724.42 --> 4725.18]  that those claims
[4725.18 --> 4725.80]  could be tested.
[4726.28 --> 4727.44]  I would not give details
[4727.44 --> 4728.82]  about time and place
[4728.82 --> 4729.66]  and people involved.
[4729.94 --> 4730.60]  So for example,
[4730.70 --> 4731.64]  I would not say
[4731.64 --> 4732.90]  that a man was born
[4732.90 --> 4735.00]  in 1985 named Trent
[4735.00 --> 4736.22]  and he was born
[4736.22 --> 4737.10]  in Langley, BC.
[4737.42 --> 4738.44]  He traveled about
[4738.44 --> 4739.34]  the Fraser Valley
[4739.34 --> 4740.40]  performing miracles
[4740.40 --> 4741.00]  and gaining
[4741.00 --> 4742.16]  a significant following.
[4742.82 --> 4743.80]  This could be falsified.
[4743.90 --> 4744.64]  This could be tested.
[4744.90 --> 4745.60]  I would not say
[4745.60 --> 4746.92]  that John Horgan,
[4747.16 --> 4748.18]  the premier of BC
[4748.18 --> 4749.54]  along with Justin Trudeau,
[4749.62 --> 4750.84]  the prime minister of Canada,
[4751.18 --> 4752.60]  had Trent electrocuted.
[4753.10 --> 4755.38]  I would not detail that.
[4755.38 --> 4756.30]  I would not detail
[4756.30 --> 4757.16]  that the electrocution
[4757.16 --> 4758.74]  took place in Port Moody, BC
[4758.74 --> 4759.94]  and I would not say
[4759.94 --> 4760.40]  that it happened
[4760.40 --> 4762.54]  on January 13, 2019
[4762.54 --> 4763.40]  at 9 a.m.
[4764.08 --> 4765.06]  I wouldn't claim
[4765.06 --> 4766.56]  that Trent rose from the grave
[4766.56 --> 4767.86]  and gained a significant
[4767.86 --> 4769.14]  following afterwards
[4769.14 --> 4770.48]  throughout British Columbia
[4770.48 --> 4771.34]  that eventually spread
[4771.34 --> 4772.02]  throughout Canada.
[4772.36 --> 4773.92]  I wouldn't make these claims
[4773.92 --> 4774.68]  as a foundation
[4774.68 --> 4775.62]  of my new religion
[4775.62 --> 4776.86]  because all of them
[4776.86 --> 4777.52]  can be tested.
[4777.70 --> 4779.68]  All of them can be falsified.
[4779.86 --> 4780.76]  You can go back
[4780.76 --> 4781.46]  and prove it.
[4781.92 --> 4783.38]  But that's what Christianity does.
[4783.48 --> 4784.42]  That's why Christianity
[4784.42 --> 4785.16]  is different from
[4785.16 --> 4785.84]  these other religions
[4785.84 --> 4787.54]  is it takes the life of Jesus
[4787.54 --> 4788.38]  and in fact it takes
[4788.38 --> 4789.70]  the history of the world
[4789.70 --> 4792.02]  and it plants it in God's story
[4792.02 --> 4793.18]  which separates it
[4793.18 --> 4795.92]  from other religions.
[4796.06 --> 4796.96]  It's not private.
[4797.08 --> 4797.64]  It's historical.
[4797.82 --> 4798.48]  It's a story.
[4798.58 --> 4800.32]  It's a true story.
[4801.24 --> 4802.60]  I took up a bunch of your answer.
[4803.18 --> 4803.38]  You did,
[4803.48 --> 4804.10]  but I really,
[4804.20 --> 4804.94]  I love that
[4804.94 --> 4806.20]  and I think that's
[4806.20 --> 4808.12]  in 1 Corinthians 15,
[4808.28 --> 4809.12]  Paul's writing about
[4809.12 --> 4810.36]  the resurrection of Jesus
[4810.36 --> 4810.92]  and he says
[4810.92 --> 4812.44]  there was 500 of us there.
[4812.44 --> 4813.76]  He's basically saying
[4813.76 --> 4814.76]  talk to him.
[4815.30 --> 4815.76]  Test it.
[4816.04 --> 4817.50]  See if this really happened.
[4817.60 --> 4818.96]  He's challenging you
[4818.96 --> 4820.50]  to go check it out.
[4821.20 --> 4821.84]  The same thing
[4821.84 --> 4823.40]  as you were
[4823.40 --> 4823.96]  ranting.
[4824.12 --> 4824.80]  Ranting, sure.
[4825.52 --> 4826.54]  I thought about
[4826.54 --> 4827.92]  Mark 4.
[4828.06 --> 4828.72]  Mark 4,
[4829.24 --> 4829.52]  Jesus,
[4829.90 --> 4831.02]  he's in the boat
[4831.02 --> 4831.70]  and he goes out
[4831.70 --> 4832.36]  into the storm
[4832.36 --> 4834.82]  and Mark writes,
[4834.98 --> 4836.32]  leaving the crowd behind,
[4836.50 --> 4837.28]  they took him along
[4837.28 --> 4838.00]  just as he was
[4838.00 --> 4838.56]  in the boat.
[4839.02 --> 4839.72]  There were also
[4839.72 --> 4840.66]  other boats with him.
[4840.66 --> 4842.74]  And the question is,
[4843.28 --> 4844.64]  why does that second line there,
[4844.68 --> 4845.14]  there were also
[4845.14 --> 4845.82]  other boats with him,
[4845.84 --> 4846.50]  why does that matter?
[4847.16 --> 4847.68]  It doesn't.
[4847.70 --> 4849.14]  It doesn't advance the story.
[4849.48 --> 4850.84]  It doesn't communicate
[4850.84 --> 4851.92]  a greater truth.
[4852.54 --> 4853.62]  But what it does do
[4853.62 --> 4855.96]  is what's probably happening,
[4856.08 --> 4856.28]  right,
[4856.32 --> 4857.18]  is that Peter,
[4857.72 --> 4859.16]  who's Mark's source
[4859.16 --> 4860.06]  for this material,
[4860.46 --> 4861.62]  is sort of standing
[4861.62 --> 4862.42]  beside Mark
[4862.42 --> 4863.04]  as he's writing
[4863.04 --> 4863.80]  these things down.
[4864.06 --> 4865.08]  He's telling this story,
[4865.16 --> 4865.28]  right?
[4865.32 --> 4865.96]  Oh, that one time
[4865.96 --> 4867.86]  we were at the Sea of Galilee
[4867.86 --> 4869.04]  and there was a,
[4869.16 --> 4870.42]  Jesus wanted to get away
[4870.42 --> 4870.84]  from the crowd
[4870.84 --> 4871.46]  so we went out
[4871.46 --> 4872.02]  into the water
[4872.02 --> 4872.78]  and there was a bunch
[4872.78 --> 4873.26]  of other boats
[4873.26 --> 4873.94]  on the water too,
[4874.20 --> 4874.32]  right?
[4874.32 --> 4875.68]  Like it's just a casual aside
[4875.68 --> 4876.86]  but Mark writes that down
[4876.86 --> 4878.24]  because it really happened,
[4878.90 --> 4879.06]  right?
[4879.10 --> 4879.70]  That's evidence
[4879.70 --> 4880.62]  that this actually
[4880.62 --> 4881.90]  took place.
[4883.08 --> 4883.56]  And so I think
[4883.56 --> 4884.96]  the historical rootedness
[4884.96 --> 4885.36]  is awesome
[4885.36 --> 4886.34]  and you see that throughout.
[4886.68 --> 4887.98]  I would also just quickly say
[4887.98 --> 4889.46]  that Christianity
[4889.46 --> 4891.48]  is the religion that works.
[4892.12 --> 4892.80]  And what I mean by that
[4892.80 --> 4893.66]  is that not only
[4893.66 --> 4894.42]  in salvation,
[4894.68 --> 4894.84]  right,
[4894.90 --> 4895.64]  that no one comes
[4895.64 --> 4896.14]  to the Father
[4896.14 --> 4897.02]  except through me,
[4897.02 --> 4897.64]  says Jesus,
[4898.10 --> 4898.60]  but Christianity
[4898.60 --> 4899.18]  is also the one
[4899.18 --> 4899.86]  in which we see
[4899.86 --> 4901.48]  lives transformed.
[4902.14 --> 4902.70]  Some of you
[4902.70 --> 4903.94]  have stories
[4903.94 --> 4905.94]  of God transforming
[4905.94 --> 4907.18]  your life dramatically
[4907.18 --> 4908.88]  and miraculously,
[4909.60 --> 4910.58]  of saving you,
[4910.96 --> 4912.08]  of healing you,
[4912.40 --> 4912.56]  right?
[4912.64 --> 4913.12]  Christianity
[4913.12 --> 4914.52]  is the one
[4914.52 --> 4915.12]  that comes
[4915.12 --> 4916.36]  with the transformation
[4916.36 --> 4917.86]  of God.
[4918.64 --> 4920.92]  And so I think
[4920.92 --> 4921.32]  Christianity
[4921.32 --> 4922.00]  is different
[4922.00 --> 4922.84]  from other world religions
[4922.84 --> 4923.64]  because it's right
[4923.64 --> 4925.20]  and because it works.
[4925.20 --> 4926.96]  All right,
[4927.00 --> 4927.56]  we're going to pivot
[4927.56 --> 4929.10]  to Thunder Round 4,
[4929.20 --> 4929.96]  but before we do that,
[4930.02 --> 4930.80]  can I just like
[4930.80 --> 4931.60]  do a little ice break
[4931.60 --> 4933.26]  and break the ice here again?
[4933.50 --> 4933.68]  Yeah.
[4933.80 --> 4934.50]  Just tell a joke.
[4934.60 --> 4935.20]  Can I tell a joke?
[4935.28 --> 4935.68]  Is that okay?
[4935.98 --> 4936.64]  Because I heard this joke
[4936.64 --> 4937.60]  this week that's really funny.
[4938.32 --> 4938.86]  Can I do that?
[4939.02 --> 4939.78]  See if you know the answer.
[4939.96 --> 4940.10]  All right.
[4940.14 --> 4941.06]  What's the difference
[4941.06 --> 4942.72]  between roast beef
[4942.72 --> 4943.54]  and pea soup?
[4944.96 --> 4945.32]  Anybody?
[4946.36 --> 4946.98]  Pastor Chris?
[4947.98 --> 4948.62]  I'm not sure
[4948.62 --> 4949.58]  I want to say the answer.
[4950.32 --> 4950.64]  Can I?
[4950.88 --> 4951.10]  Yeah,
[4951.34 --> 4952.38]  you can do you, man.
[4952.38 --> 4953.58]  Anyone can roast beef.
[4954.14 --> 4954.42]  All right.
[4955.62 --> 4956.64]  Thunder Round 4.
[4958.30 --> 4958.98]  It's coming.
[4959.16 --> 4959.46]  It's coming.
[4959.46 --> 4960.50]  It's coming in waves.
[4960.68 --> 4960.98]  There it is.
[4960.98 --> 4961.66]  There it is.
[4961.70 --> 4962.16]  It's clipped.
[4962.92 --> 4963.24]  All right.
[4964.74 --> 4966.14]  Thunder Round 4.
[4967.86 --> 4969.42]  This question needs
[4969.42 --> 4969.82]  a little bit
[4969.82 --> 4970.70]  of a preamble here.
[4970.88 --> 4973.12]  So it's about Acts Chapter 2.
[4973.58 --> 4975.14]  It's a very cool chapter
[4975.14 --> 4975.66]  in the Bible.
[4976.08 --> 4977.36]  It describes the outpouring
[4977.36 --> 4978.30]  of the Holy Spirit.
[4978.42 --> 4979.28]  It comes down on Peter
[4979.28 --> 4980.46]  and the disciples.
[4980.46 --> 4981.80]  Peter then addresses
[4981.80 --> 4982.58]  this crowd
[4982.58 --> 4983.72]  full of the Holy Spirit
[4983.72 --> 4985.24]  and he's able to speak
[4985.24 --> 4986.44]  to all of them in tongues
[4986.44 --> 4987.90]  in their own language.
[4988.00 --> 4988.76]  Now the question
[4988.76 --> 4989.60]  that was written down
[4989.60 --> 4990.00]  was this.
[4990.32 --> 4991.90]  Was this gifting of tongues
[4991.90 --> 4993.48]  a permanent gift
[4993.48 --> 4994.40]  given to Peter
[4994.40 --> 4995.32]  and the apostles
[4995.32 --> 4996.64]  or was it a gift
[4996.64 --> 4997.76]  given to the crowd
[4997.76 --> 4999.32]  who heard Peter's speech
[4999.32 --> 5000.04]  and were able
[5000.04 --> 5001.22]  to understand it
[5001.22 --> 5002.52]  only to be then
[5002.52 --> 5003.04]  taken away
[5003.04 --> 5004.04]  when the sermon was over?
[5005.42 --> 5006.08]  That track?
[5006.16 --> 5006.48]  That question
[5006.48 --> 5006.96]  makes sense?
[5007.56 --> 5008.54]  Is the gift of tongues
[5008.54 --> 5009.48]  a permanent gift
[5009.48 --> 5010.64]  or was it taken away?
[5010.78 --> 5010.88]  Right.
[5011.00 --> 5011.70]  Was it for Peter
[5011.70 --> 5012.58]  or was it for the crowd?
[5014.32 --> 5015.34]  And so I think
[5015.34 --> 5018.42]  there's a lot going on
[5018.42 --> 5018.88]  in this question.
[5018.96 --> 5020.02]  We'll probably have follow-ups.
[5020.86 --> 5022.78]  But Acts 2 verse 4
[5022.78 --> 5023.64]  says that
[5023.64 --> 5025.04]  all of them were filled
[5025.04 --> 5025.78]  with the Holy Spirit
[5025.78 --> 5026.88]  and began to speak
[5026.88 --> 5027.84]  in other tongues
[5027.84 --> 5029.14]  as the Spirit enabled them.
[5029.62 --> 5031.04]  And so first answer,
[5031.38 --> 5031.56]  right,
[5031.66 --> 5032.48]  from the text
[5032.48 --> 5033.02]  you can see
[5033.02 --> 5034.90]  that it's the apostles
[5034.90 --> 5035.62]  or the disciples
[5035.62 --> 5036.46]  who are speaking
[5036.46 --> 5037.26]  in tongues
[5037.26 --> 5038.04]  that they all
[5038.04 --> 5039.36]  were able to do it
[5039.36 --> 5041.04]  such that everyone
[5041.04 --> 5041.96]  who heard them
[5041.96 --> 5043.26]  heard in their own tongue.
[5043.68 --> 5043.86]  Right?
[5043.92 --> 5044.68]  And now everyone
[5044.68 --> 5045.42]  who heard them,
[5045.48 --> 5046.44]  there's a large group
[5046.44 --> 5049.62]  of Jewish diaspora
[5049.62 --> 5050.72]  who have gathered
[5050.72 --> 5052.44]  for the festival
[5052.44 --> 5053.38]  of Pentecost.
[5053.48 --> 5054.20]  They have come from
[5054.20 --> 5055.68]  all over the place
[5055.68 --> 5056.68]  to this is one
[5056.68 --> 5057.62]  of the pilgrimage festivals
[5058.22 --> 5059.76]  in the Jewish religion.
[5061.40 --> 5062.44]  And yet,
[5062.78 --> 5065.12]  after that particular event,
[5065.12 --> 5067.04]  there is no evidence
[5067.04 --> 5068.70]  from the rest
[5068.70 --> 5069.72]  of the book of Acts
[5069.72 --> 5071.24]  that the ability
[5071.24 --> 5072.60]  to speak in tongues
[5072.60 --> 5073.64]  or that the ability
[5073.64 --> 5074.56]  to go into a place
[5074.56 --> 5075.72]  with a different language
[5075.72 --> 5077.28]  and they were heard
[5077.28 --> 5077.98]  in their own tongue.
[5078.04 --> 5078.70]  Now I get that
[5078.70 --> 5080.70]  the absence of evidence
[5080.70 --> 5081.52]  is not the evidence
[5081.52 --> 5082.10]  of absence.
[5082.50 --> 5083.48]  I understand that.
[5084.22 --> 5084.62]  And yet,
[5084.86 --> 5085.68]  there doesn't seem
[5085.68 --> 5086.18]  to be...
[5086.18 --> 5086.52]  Attract.
[5086.76 --> 5087.06]  Good.
[5087.54 --> 5088.34]  There doesn't seem
[5088.34 --> 5089.10]  to be any indication
[5089.10 --> 5090.16]  that that continued on.
[5091.38 --> 5092.46]  That being said,
[5092.62 --> 5093.90]  we could begin
[5093.90 --> 5094.40]  to understand
[5094.40 --> 5095.08]  a little bit more
[5095.08 --> 5098.04]  when we look
[5098.04 --> 5098.78]  at the cultural
[5098.78 --> 5100.10]  and the sort of
[5100.10 --> 5101.42]  geopolitical context
[5101.42 --> 5103.64]  in which the book of Acts
[5103.64 --> 5105.06]  and at the Pentecost festival
[5105.06 --> 5106.04]  is taking place.
[5106.26 --> 5107.18]  Because really,
[5107.42 --> 5108.84]  there's probably only
[5108.84 --> 5110.22]  a small handful
[5110.22 --> 5110.96]  of languages
[5110.96 --> 5111.78]  that would have been
[5111.78 --> 5112.54]  represented there.
[5113.42 --> 5113.88]  And so,
[5114.26 --> 5114.84]  Aramaic
[5114.84 --> 5116.96]  was the common tongue
[5116.96 --> 5118.56]  of most of the Jews
[5118.56 --> 5121.06]  who lived in that...
[5121.06 --> 5122.24]  in the region
[5122.24 --> 5122.90]  of Palestine
[5122.90 --> 5124.64]  and Israel.
[5124.96 --> 5126.88]  So that was language one.
[5127.54 --> 5128.06]  Greek
[5128.06 --> 5129.20]  is the
[5129.20 --> 5130.42]  lingua franca
[5130.42 --> 5131.16]  of the region
[5131.16 --> 5132.42]  and so that area
[5132.42 --> 5133.10]  of the empire
[5133.10 --> 5134.92]  because of the exploits
[5134.92 --> 5136.02]  of Alexander the Great,
[5136.30 --> 5136.48]  you know,
[5136.52 --> 5137.48]  300 years before,
[5137.92 --> 5139.22]  was the language
[5139.22 --> 5140.02]  that everybody
[5140.02 --> 5141.28]  spoke.
[5141.94 --> 5142.80]  Also likely,
[5142.92 --> 5143.34]  there was probably
[5143.34 --> 5143.86]  some Latin
[5143.86 --> 5144.60]  being spoke
[5144.60 --> 5145.12]  as you have
[5145.12 --> 5146.32]  people from Rome
[5146.32 --> 5147.24]  and the governing officials
[5147.24 --> 5147.76]  who are coming.
[5148.78 --> 5149.98]  There's a possibility
[5149.98 --> 5151.22]  that some
[5151.22 --> 5152.70]  would have spoke Hebrew,
[5153.22 --> 5154.22]  although that language
[5154.22 --> 5155.68]  was mostly reserved
[5155.68 --> 5157.42]  for specific religious
[5157.42 --> 5159.52]  or high political events
[5159.52 --> 5160.94]  and it may even
[5160.94 --> 5161.40]  have been
[5161.40 --> 5163.22]  not uncommon to...
[5163.22 --> 5163.84]  If you're familiar
[5163.84 --> 5165.18]  with the Roman Catholic tradition
[5165.18 --> 5167.22]  prior to Second Vatican Council
[5167.22 --> 5168.46]  when all the services
[5168.46 --> 5169.42]  were held in Latin,
[5169.80 --> 5170.54]  the average person
[5170.54 --> 5171.54]  sitting in the pews
[5171.54 --> 5172.48]  didn't understand
[5172.48 --> 5173.24]  what was being said.
[5173.86 --> 5174.46]  It's possible
[5174.46 --> 5175.48]  that that was similar
[5175.48 --> 5176.66]  in the Second Temple period
[5176.66 --> 5178.08]  when they were using Hebrew
[5178.08 --> 5179.64]  to do the services
[5179.64 --> 5180.88]  that the average person
[5180.88 --> 5181.88]  didn't fully understand
[5181.88 --> 5182.78]  what was going on.
[5184.68 --> 5185.36]  And then,
[5185.58 --> 5187.64]  there is a small chance
[5187.64 --> 5188.34]  that there's
[5188.34 --> 5189.06]  what are called
[5189.06 --> 5190.64]  Neo-Phrygian dialects
[5190.64 --> 5191.34]  that are being spoken.
[5191.48 --> 5192.78]  That's from modern-day Turkey,
[5193.00 --> 5194.32]  but that's related to Greek
[5194.32 --> 5195.16]  and so if you spoke Greek,
[5195.22 --> 5195.72]  you would have been able
[5195.72 --> 5196.26]  to understand.
[5197.00 --> 5197.28]  And then,
[5197.60 --> 5197.98]  maybe,
[5198.14 --> 5199.22]  even less likely,
[5199.68 --> 5201.46]  represented in Pentecost,
[5201.72 --> 5202.68]  there would be
[5202.68 --> 5203.88]  some forms of demotic,
[5203.88 --> 5204.52]  which is
[5204.52 --> 5206.74]  the then-contemporary
[5206.74 --> 5207.54]  Egyptian.
[5209.06 --> 5209.58]  But,
[5209.66 --> 5210.76]  especially for those
[5210.76 --> 5211.44]  who would travel
[5211.44 --> 5212.26]  around the world,
[5212.54 --> 5213.42]  it wouldn't be uncommon
[5213.42 --> 5214.22]  for these citizens
[5214.22 --> 5215.26]  to be at least
[5215.26 --> 5216.06]  trilingual.
[5217.68 --> 5217.84]  Right?
[5217.90 --> 5218.18]  And so,
[5218.44 --> 5219.36]  sometimes I think we,
[5220.00 --> 5220.68]  and that's not to
[5220.68 --> 5222.16]  mitigate the miracle,
[5222.30 --> 5224.14]  but we overstate,
[5224.52 --> 5225.74]  we presume
[5225.74 --> 5226.26]  that there's,
[5226.44 --> 5226.68]  you know,
[5226.92 --> 5228.28]  20s or hundreds
[5228.28 --> 5228.86]  of languages
[5228.86 --> 5230.00]  that are being understood there.
[5230.06 --> 5231.34]  That's probably not the case.
[5231.34 --> 5233.30]  Also,
[5233.60 --> 5234.90]  we'll dig a little deep here
[5234.90 --> 5235.78]  into language
[5235.78 --> 5237.70]  and the word tongues
[5237.70 --> 5238.70]  in Greek.
[5239.38 --> 5240.32]  The word tongues
[5240.32 --> 5240.86]  in Greek
[5240.86 --> 5241.60]  is glosius,
[5242.26 --> 5243.80]  and that's the word
[5243.80 --> 5245.02]  that we get glosectomy
[5245.02 --> 5245.56]  from,
[5245.90 --> 5246.06]  right?
[5246.12 --> 5247.12]  That's the surgery
[5247.12 --> 5248.02]  that we have
[5248.02 --> 5248.80]  to remove part
[5248.80 --> 5249.30]  of our tongue,
[5249.74 --> 5250.02]  right?
[5250.24 --> 5251.58]  Or the word
[5251.58 --> 5252.30]  where we get,
[5252.84 --> 5253.44]  I want to make sure
[5253.44 --> 5253.94]  I say this right,
[5254.42 --> 5255.36]  ankyloglossia.
[5255.82 --> 5256.04]  And so,
[5256.10 --> 5257.14]  maybe some of your kids
[5257.14 --> 5258.32]  were born with a tongue tie,
[5258.52 --> 5258.68]  right?
[5258.70 --> 5259.50]  The surgery to cut
[5259.50 --> 5260.30]  that tongue tie
[5260.30 --> 5261.38]  is ankyloglossia,
[5261.68 --> 5262.10]  but in there
[5262.10 --> 5262.86]  you hear the word
[5262.86 --> 5263.42]  glosius,
[5263.66 --> 5264.94]  but it's also the word
[5264.94 --> 5265.80]  from which we get
[5265.80 --> 5266.48]  glossary,
[5267.02 --> 5267.20]  right?
[5267.26 --> 5267.96]  You find that
[5267.96 --> 5268.78]  at the back of a book
[5268.78 --> 5269.32]  you might read
[5269.32 --> 5270.30]  a list of subjects
[5270.30 --> 5271.40]  pertaining to that
[5271.40 --> 5272.20]  particular field.
[5272.78 --> 5272.92]  So,
[5272.98 --> 5273.86]  the word tongues,
[5274.04 --> 5274.42]  glosius,
[5274.56 --> 5275.86]  can mean tongue,
[5276.08 --> 5276.92]  but it can also mean
[5276.92 --> 5277.44]  languages,
[5278.16 --> 5278.42]  right?
[5278.48 --> 5279.48]  And here,
[5279.66 --> 5280.22]  in Acts 2,
[5280.36 --> 5281.66]  it's used for other languages,
[5281.66 --> 5282.94]  that's clear from the context,
[5283.22 --> 5284.82]  but in a place like Acts 19
[5284.82 --> 5286.42]  or 1 Corinthians 11
[5286.42 --> 5287.22]  through 14,
[5287.78 --> 5288.68]  it's also clear
[5288.68 --> 5289.58]  that it refers to
[5289.58 --> 5291.46]  the speech of angels
[5291.46 --> 5292.90]  or a special
[5292.90 --> 5294.58]  sort of prayer language
[5294.58 --> 5296.24]  used for talking to God.
[5297.38 --> 5297.64]  Now,
[5298.42 --> 5299.46]  recognizing that tongues
[5299.46 --> 5300.90]  has multiple uses
[5300.90 --> 5301.54]  and meanings,
[5301.66 --> 5302.48]  I think it is important
[5302.48 --> 5302.92]  to note
[5302.92 --> 5304.86]  that in that conversation
[5304.86 --> 5305.64]  in Corinthians,
[5306.08 --> 5306.78]  in 1 Corinthians,
[5307.26 --> 5308.64]  when Paul is talking,
[5308.90 --> 5309.82]  1 Corinthians 13
[5309.82 --> 5310.84]  is this famous chapter
[5310.84 --> 5311.36]  on love,
[5311.44 --> 5311.62]  right?
[5311.66 --> 5312.36]  Love is patient,
[5312.36 --> 5314.40]  and it says
[5314.40 --> 5316.80]  that love never ceases,
[5316.80 --> 5318.18]  but Paul goes on to say
[5318.18 --> 5319.40]  where there is tongues,
[5319.68 --> 5320.74]  they will cease.
[5321.96 --> 5322.36]  Now,
[5322.48 --> 5323.54]  don't hear what I'm not saying.
[5323.78 --> 5324.48]  I'm not trying to say
[5324.48 --> 5325.80]  that we are cessationists,
[5326.16 --> 5326.92]  and by that I mean
[5326.92 --> 5328.10]  that we believe
[5328.10 --> 5328.82]  that the Spirit
[5328.82 --> 5329.94]  doesn't operate
[5329.94 --> 5330.68]  in that way.
[5331.42 --> 5332.70]  I'm simply saying
[5332.70 --> 5334.04]  that tongues
[5334.04 --> 5335.68]  have an end point
[5335.68 --> 5336.94]  to their usefulness,
[5337.22 --> 5337.40]  right?
[5337.42 --> 5338.28]  The special gifts
[5338.28 --> 5339.64]  do have a stop
[5339.64 --> 5341.66]  or a defined term
[5341.66 --> 5343.38]  of their being used,
[5344.02 --> 5345.76]  whereas love does not.
[5345.76 --> 5347.22]  And so to answer
[5347.22 --> 5347.70]  the question,
[5347.84 --> 5348.58]  long story short,
[5348.92 --> 5349.90]  it seems that
[5349.90 --> 5350.54]  it is limited
[5350.54 --> 5352.02]  to that encounter.
[5352.68 --> 5353.78]  That's not to say
[5353.78 --> 5355.08]  necessarily about tongues
[5355.08 --> 5356.04]  being present
[5356.04 --> 5356.52]  in the life
[5356.52 --> 5357.18]  of the church today.
[5357.44 --> 5357.68]  Perfect.
[5357.80 --> 5358.34]  I was going to ask
[5358.34 --> 5358.74]  a question
[5358.74 --> 5359.52]  to end that one off,
[5359.56 --> 5360.44]  but you answered it already,
[5360.54 --> 5361.72]  so we're just going to
[5361.72 --> 5362.70]  bypass that then,
[5362.80 --> 5362.88]  right?
[5363.22 --> 5363.80]  Anything I can
[5363.80 --> 5364.36]  to cut you out.
[5364.74 --> 5365.98]  That's what everybody says.
[5366.98 --> 5367.34]  All right.
[5367.98 --> 5368.74]  So we're on
[5368.74 --> 5369.56]  to the final question.
[5370.18 --> 5370.34]  So,
[5371.42 --> 5372.22]  Thunder Round 5,
[5372.42 --> 5373.20]  final question,
[5373.20 --> 5376.06]  not just of today's adventure,
[5376.30 --> 5377.60]  but also the sermon series
[5377.60 --> 5378.74]  throughout the summer,
[5379.22 --> 5379.78]  is this,
[5379.80 --> 5380.38]  and it's a really,
[5380.58 --> 5381.24]  really good question
[5381.24 --> 5381.90]  to sort of end
[5381.90 --> 5383.52]  this whole sermon series on.
[5383.94 --> 5384.20]  It's,
[5384.48 --> 5385.14]  what do you do
[5385.14 --> 5386.26]  when you question
[5386.26 --> 5387.62]  God's existence?
[5389.96 --> 5390.70]  So you said
[5390.70 --> 5391.66]  it was a really good question,
[5391.78 --> 5392.56]  so what do you do?
[5394.12 --> 5395.20]  I would say
[5395.20 --> 5395.82]  keep questioning.
[5397.70 --> 5398.48]  Keep questioning.
[5399.04 --> 5399.42]  And I think
[5399.42 --> 5400.12]  that's the right answer,
[5400.48 --> 5400.90]  actually.
[5400.90 --> 5402.82]  When you question
[5402.82 --> 5403.74]  God's existence,
[5404.30 --> 5405.64]  keep on questioning.
[5406.50 --> 5407.16]  And let's be really
[5407.16 --> 5408.38]  clear about this,
[5408.44 --> 5408.56]  right?
[5408.60 --> 5409.48]  As Christians,
[5410.04 --> 5411.10]  we live
[5411.10 --> 5411.98]  and operate
[5411.98 --> 5412.86]  and exercise
[5412.86 --> 5413.64]  our faith
[5413.64 --> 5415.46]  in the long history
[5415.46 --> 5416.30]  and tradition
[5416.30 --> 5418.34]  of asking questions,
[5419.36 --> 5421.06]  of seeking out answers.
[5421.78 --> 5423.94]  Fides quarens intellectum.
[5424.46 --> 5425.42]  You sound like Harry Potter.
[5425.72 --> 5426.18]  I wish.
[5427.22 --> 5429.08]  Faith-seeking understanding.
[5429.08 --> 5431.88]  It's from Anselm
[5431.88 --> 5433.62]  and it picks up
[5433.62 --> 5434.20]  on the tradition
[5434.20 --> 5435.50]  of Augustine before him
[5435.50 --> 5436.26]  and Irenaeus
[5436.26 --> 5437.22]  and Justin Martyr,
[5437.62 --> 5437.76]  right?
[5438.18 --> 5439.10]  Our faith
[5439.10 --> 5440.46]  seeks understanding
[5440.46 --> 5441.86]  and so we ask
[5441.86 --> 5442.82]  questions.
[5443.46 --> 5444.44]  Peter Abelard says,
[5444.80 --> 5445.38]  by doubting,
[5445.50 --> 5446.34]  we come to question
[5446.34 --> 5447.12]  and by questioning,
[5447.30 --> 5448.58]  we perceive truth.
[5449.32 --> 5450.76]  Without questions,
[5451.06 --> 5452.08]  we don't find truth.
[5452.08 --> 5452.76]  truth.
[5454.04 --> 5454.88]  And so if you're
[5454.88 --> 5455.78]  questioning the existence
[5455.78 --> 5456.26]  of God,
[5456.36 --> 5457.22]  keep asking those
[5457.22 --> 5458.10]  questions.
[5459.00 --> 5460.22]  You have a story
[5460.22 --> 5460.80]  from your life,
[5460.88 --> 5460.96]  right?
[5460.96 --> 5461.08]  I do.
[5461.08 --> 5462.18]  That might highlight
[5462.18 --> 5462.84]  this a little bit.
[5463.68 --> 5464.50]  So when I,
[5465.14 --> 5466.04]  some of you have heard
[5466.04 --> 5466.50]  this story,
[5466.58 --> 5467.68]  but when I was 26,
[5467.92 --> 5468.80]  I was in seminary,
[5469.66 --> 5470.62]  my final year
[5470.62 --> 5471.64]  of seminary,
[5471.64 --> 5474.38]  and I was studying
[5474.38 --> 5475.00]  theology
[5475.00 --> 5476.02]  and Christian philosophy
[5476.02 --> 5477.72]  and deep in the midst
[5477.72 --> 5478.30]  of this
[5478.30 --> 5479.50]  all day,
[5479.72 --> 5480.44]  every day,
[5481.28 --> 5482.70]  and I went through
[5482.70 --> 5483.82]  a deep,
[5484.18 --> 5485.20]  deep crisis
[5485.20 --> 5485.82]  of faith
[5485.82 --> 5487.92]  to the point
[5487.92 --> 5489.88]  where I was not sure
[5489.88 --> 5491.30]  if I believed
[5491.30 --> 5492.38]  or if I could believe.
[5493.48 --> 5494.40]  It was
[5494.40 --> 5495.96]  an existential
[5495.96 --> 5497.24]  crisis of faith
[5497.24 --> 5499.02]  that got really dark
[5499.02 --> 5501.02]  and got really angry,
[5501.46 --> 5501.84]  actually,
[5502.12 --> 5503.28]  at the people
[5503.28 --> 5503.88]  around me.
[5505.08 --> 5505.22]  And
[5505.22 --> 5509.52]  I'm trying to think
[5509.52 --> 5510.64]  of a polite company
[5510.64 --> 5511.34]  way to say this,
[5511.42 --> 5511.54]  but
[5511.54 --> 5514.20]  I was not pleasant
[5514.20 --> 5514.88]  to be around,
[5515.50 --> 5516.46]  and I was trying
[5516.46 --> 5517.40]  to fight with everybody
[5517.40 --> 5518.96]  about ideas
[5518.96 --> 5519.68]  or doctrines
[5519.68 --> 5520.82]  or what have you.
[5521.14 --> 5521.72]  And I had a group
[5521.72 --> 5522.16]  of friends
[5522.16 --> 5523.72]  who I would
[5523.72 --> 5524.92]  always challenge
[5524.92 --> 5526.08]  and ask questions
[5526.08 --> 5528.00]  and come up
[5528.00 --> 5528.52]  with the most
[5528.52 --> 5530.64]  ridiculous scenarios
[5530.64 --> 5532.18]  and just force them
[5532.18 --> 5533.32]  to process
[5533.32 --> 5534.72]  my anxiety.
[5536.02 --> 5536.92]  And yet,
[5537.46 --> 5538.22]  they did.
[5539.10 --> 5540.02]  They heard me,
[5540.14 --> 5540.62]  they listened,
[5540.80 --> 5541.48]  they challenged,
[5541.92 --> 5542.80]  they cried,
[5543.60 --> 5544.36]  they prayed,
[5544.84 --> 5546.30]  and they just
[5546.30 --> 5547.36]  walked alongside me
[5547.36 --> 5548.44]  in the midst of that.
[5550.44 --> 5551.46]  And if it weren't
[5551.46 --> 5552.08]  for them,
[5552.36 --> 5553.54]  I wouldn't be here today.
[5553.98 --> 5554.62]  I wouldn't be sitting
[5554.62 --> 5555.32]  on this stage.
[5555.32 --> 5557.74]  If it weren't
[5557.74 --> 5558.24]  for them,
[5559.12 --> 5560.82]  yeah,
[5560.86 --> 5561.22]  I don't know.
[5561.64 --> 5562.00]  I don't even
[5562.00 --> 5562.60]  want to speculate.
[5564.20 --> 5564.94]  And remember
[5564.94 --> 5565.62]  how we told you
[5565.62 --> 5566.30]  back at the beginning,
[5566.42 --> 5566.96]  question two,
[5567.04 --> 5567.34]  we said,
[5567.40 --> 5568.10]  remember that thing
[5568.10 --> 5568.98]  in the back of your head
[5568.98 --> 5569.58]  about community?
[5569.70 --> 5570.50]  It's going to come back
[5570.50 --> 5570.78]  later?
[5570.86 --> 5570.98]  Well,
[5571.02 --> 5571.60]  here it is.
[5572.12 --> 5573.26]  And Pastor Chris,
[5573.30 --> 5573.80]  your testimony
[5573.80 --> 5574.80]  just speaks to that
[5574.80 --> 5575.34]  so beautifully.
[5576.02 --> 5576.74]  If you're having
[5576.74 --> 5577.66]  a crisis of faith,
[5577.78 --> 5580.64]  if you are questioning
[5580.64 --> 5581.68]  God's existence,
[5581.96 --> 5582.60]  keep questioning,
[5582.76 --> 5583.44]  but question it
[5583.44 --> 5584.14]  in community.
[5584.38 --> 5585.18]  Question it with
[5585.18 --> 5586.38]  people that you know,
[5586.48 --> 5587.48]  people that you trust.
[5588.98 --> 5590.24]  The importance
[5590.24 --> 5590.88]  of the community
[5590.88 --> 5591.48]  of faith really
[5591.48 --> 5592.50]  comes out here
[5592.50 --> 5593.66]  very vividly.
[5593.72 --> 5594.46]  Diedrich Bonhoeffer
[5594.46 --> 5594.84]  says this,
[5594.90 --> 5595.14]  he says,
[5595.24 --> 5596.12]  Christ in the heart
[5596.12 --> 5596.86]  of your brother
[5596.86 --> 5598.04]  or sister
[5598.04 --> 5599.62]  is stronger
[5599.62 --> 5600.86]  than Christ
[5600.86 --> 5601.86]  in your own heart.
[5601.86 --> 5605.08]  Doubt is good.
[5605.30 --> 5606.26]  Doubt is a natural thing.
[5606.34 --> 5607.18]  We believe in a God
[5607.18 --> 5607.80]  that is beyond
[5607.80 --> 5608.58]  our understanding.
[5608.72 --> 5609.40]  If God is beyond
[5609.40 --> 5610.18]  our understanding,
[5610.32 --> 5610.96]  we will inevitably
[5610.96 --> 5611.92]  doubt that.
[5612.10 --> 5612.88]  That is a natural
[5612.88 --> 5613.50]  part of faith.
[5613.56 --> 5614.60]  It is a natural part
[5614.60 --> 5616.20]  of faith in God.
[5616.78 --> 5618.24]  But doubt is not bad.
[5618.46 --> 5619.18]  Doubt is good.
[5619.26 --> 5620.00]  It forces us
[5620.00 --> 5621.40]  to ask these questions.
[5622.04 --> 5622.44]  But,
[5622.60 --> 5623.52]  as you just mentioned,
[5623.58 --> 5624.10]  we need to ask
[5624.10 --> 5624.68]  these questions
[5624.68 --> 5625.68]  in community.
[5626.28 --> 5627.02]  The only time
[5627.02 --> 5628.82]  doubt becomes toxic
[5628.82 --> 5629.64]  is if we do
[5629.64 --> 5630.40]  one of two things
[5630.40 --> 5630.76]  with it.
[5630.76 --> 5632.64]  If we internalize doubt
[5632.64 --> 5634.00]  and we leave it inside
[5634.00 --> 5634.76]  to try to wrestle
[5634.76 --> 5635.54]  with ourselves
[5635.54 --> 5636.50]  and not deal
[5636.50 --> 5638.08]  with our community,
[5638.34 --> 5639.38]  it can become toxic.
[5639.56 --> 5641.02]  It can cause anxieties.
[5641.24 --> 5642.70]  It can cause improper
[5642.70 --> 5643.56]  coping mechanisms.
[5644.24 --> 5645.12]  And you will rarely
[5645.12 --> 5646.24]  be able to head
[5646.24 --> 5647.32]  to those answers
[5647.32 --> 5648.08]  and find the truth
[5648.08 --> 5648.40]  in them.
[5649.40 --> 5650.20]  Doubt that you deal
[5650.20 --> 5650.78]  with yourself
[5650.78 --> 5652.38]  can become toxic.
[5652.58 --> 5653.10]  We need to talk
[5653.10 --> 5653.42]  to others.
[5653.56 --> 5654.30]  Now, there's another
[5654.30 --> 5655.16]  way that doubt
[5655.16 --> 5655.98]  can become toxic
[5655.98 --> 5657.10]  and that's if you go
[5657.10 --> 5657.92]  to the mountaintops
[5657.92 --> 5658.98]  and just shout it
[5658.98 --> 5660.16]  to the world around you
[5660.16 --> 5662.06]  without an attempt
[5662.06 --> 5663.46]  to communicate
[5663.46 --> 5664.44]  or converse
[5664.44 --> 5666.02]  or dialogue about it.
[5667.18 --> 5667.72]  If you're doing
[5667.72 --> 5668.20]  those things,
[5668.28 --> 5668.62]  if you're just
[5668.62 --> 5669.26]  proclaiming it
[5669.26 --> 5669.70]  to the world,
[5669.76 --> 5670.40]  which is easier
[5670.40 --> 5671.24]  than it's ever been
[5671.24 --> 5671.92]  before because
[5671.92 --> 5672.92]  of the good old internet,
[5673.56 --> 5675.02]  that can also lead
[5675.02 --> 5675.64]  to, again,
[5675.76 --> 5677.10]  just internal struggles.
[5677.58 --> 5679.12]  And it does not lead
[5679.12 --> 5680.18]  to real genuine
[5680.18 --> 5680.94]  discussion,
[5681.08 --> 5681.50]  engagement,
[5681.96 --> 5682.24]  discovery.
[5682.30 --> 5682.60]  And it's something
[5682.60 --> 5683.38]  actually we're seeing
[5683.38 --> 5685.24]  quite prevalently
[5685.24 --> 5686.58]  in our culture
[5686.58 --> 5687.08]  these days
[5687.08 --> 5688.54]  is this proclaiming
[5688.54 --> 5688.88]  your doubt
[5688.88 --> 5689.86]  from the mountaintops.
[5689.94 --> 5690.60]  Maybe you can speak
[5690.60 --> 5691.38]  to that a little bit more.
[5691.94 --> 5692.66]  Yeah, and so
[5692.66 --> 5694.18]  real quick,
[5694.30 --> 5695.12]  and thank you
[5695.12 --> 5696.08]  for your understanding
[5696.08 --> 5696.56]  and patience.
[5696.84 --> 5697.76]  I realize what time
[5697.76 --> 5698.12]  it is,
[5698.22 --> 5699.30]  although just now
[5699.30 --> 5699.98]  as it popped up
[5699.98 --> 5700.42]  on my screen.
[5702.46 --> 5703.36]  In the last number
[5703.36 --> 5703.82]  of years,
[5703.94 --> 5704.46]  a few years,
[5704.46 --> 5705.34]  we've heard all sorts
[5705.34 --> 5706.04]  of what are called
[5706.04 --> 5707.70]  evangelical deconversion
[5707.70 --> 5708.26]  stories.
[5709.56 --> 5710.20]  Some of you,
[5710.36 --> 5710.74]  if you grew up
[5710.74 --> 5711.26]  in the 90s
[5711.26 --> 5711.80]  like I did,
[5711.88 --> 5712.30]  you would know
[5712.30 --> 5713.38]  the name Josh Harris,
[5714.08 --> 5714.26]  right,
[5714.28 --> 5714.82]  he wrote the book
[5714.82 --> 5716.02]  I Kissed Dating Goodbye,
[5716.68 --> 5716.84]  right,
[5716.88 --> 5717.90]  he was an advocate
[5717.90 --> 5718.98]  for purity culture
[5718.98 --> 5720.52]  and the like.
[5720.80 --> 5721.68]  A few years ago,
[5721.86 --> 5723.84]  he apologized
[5723.84 --> 5724.90]  for what he did
[5724.90 --> 5725.42]  in that book
[5725.42 --> 5725.88]  and the harm
[5725.88 --> 5727.00]  that it caused people
[5727.00 --> 5727.72]  and then just
[5727.72 --> 5729.34]  a year ago,
[5729.60 --> 5731.86]  he and his wife
[5731.86 --> 5732.66]  split up.
[5732.74 --> 5733.30]  He's now married
[5733.30 --> 5734.82]  to a new woman
[5734.82 --> 5736.80]  and he no longer
[5736.80 --> 5738.52]  identifies as Christian,
[5738.72 --> 5739.18]  his words.
[5740.20 --> 5741.24]  And he's actually
[5741.24 --> 5742.16]  just released
[5742.16 --> 5742.94]  although he did
[5742.94 --> 5743.64]  get pulled back
[5743.64 --> 5744.30]  because of the
[5744.30 --> 5745.24]  controversy it caused.
[5745.30 --> 5746.04]  But he just released
[5746.04 --> 5747.96]  a course on how
[5747.96 --> 5749.12]  to deconstruct
[5749.12 --> 5749.76]  your own faith.
[5750.36 --> 5751.02]  And so he's become
[5751.02 --> 5751.72]  an evangelist
[5751.72 --> 5752.52]  for these deconversion
[5752.52 --> 5753.02]  stories because
[5753.02 --> 5753.94]  he's got that platform.
[5755.04 --> 5755.96]  Another name
[5755.96 --> 5756.46]  that you might be
[5756.46 --> 5757.98]  familiar with
[5757.98 --> 5759.38]  is Rhett and Link.
[5759.60 --> 5760.52]  They have a YouTube channel.
[5761.56 --> 5762.34]  They also went
[5762.34 --> 5763.88]  through a very public
[5763.88 --> 5765.04]  deconversion experience
[5765.04 --> 5766.06]  and just gathered up
[5766.06 --> 5766.62]  as many people
[5766.62 --> 5767.10]  as they could
[5767.10 --> 5768.28]  in the process.
[5769.30 --> 5770.08]  These are stories
[5770.08 --> 5770.58]  that are big
[5770.58 --> 5771.16]  and are public
[5771.16 --> 5772.28]  and if I'm
[5772.28 --> 5773.24]  frank with you,
[5773.32 --> 5774.40]  they listen
[5774.40 --> 5775.08]  to the voice
[5775.08 --> 5775.68]  of culture
[5775.68 --> 5776.44]  more than they
[5776.44 --> 5777.20]  listen to the voice
[5777.20 --> 5777.62]  of Jesus
[5777.62 --> 5778.24]  and the church.
[5779.32 --> 5779.76]  And so we need
[5779.76 --> 5780.26]  to let Jesus
[5780.26 --> 5781.00]  and the church
[5781.00 --> 5781.98]  speak into those
[5781.98 --> 5782.38]  moments.
[5783.26 --> 5784.14]  As you were talking,
[5784.38 --> 5786.14]  I love this text
[5786.14 --> 5787.54]  from 2 Timothy 2
[5787.54 --> 5788.98]  verse 13.
[5789.68 --> 5790.24]  Paul writes
[5790.24 --> 5790.80]  to Timothy
[5790.80 --> 5792.12]  likely quoting
[5792.12 --> 5793.06]  a poem
[5793.06 --> 5793.52]  but saying,
[5793.70 --> 5794.76]  if we are faithless,
[5794.94 --> 5795.96]  he remains faithful
[5795.96 --> 5796.72]  for he cannot
[5796.72 --> 5797.60]  disown himself.
[5797.60 --> 5800.26]  And so be full
[5800.26 --> 5800.80]  of doubt.
[5801.20 --> 5802.36]  Question God's existence.
[5802.90 --> 5803.58]  Let your faith
[5803.58 --> 5804.96]  grow and wane
[5804.96 --> 5806.76]  because it's
[5806.76 --> 5807.86]  Jesus
[5807.86 --> 5808.92]  that matters.
[5809.92 --> 5810.48]  He cannot
[5810.48 --> 5811.14]  disown
[5811.14 --> 5812.04]  himself.
[5812.56 --> 5813.22]  He will
[5813.22 --> 5813.76]  remain
[5813.76 --> 5814.66]  faithful.
[5815.38 --> 5815.84]  And so we
[5815.84 --> 5816.34]  as a church,
[5816.44 --> 5817.16]  we want to be
[5817.16 --> 5817.86]  a place where
[5817.86 --> 5818.44]  it is okay
[5818.44 --> 5819.10]  to doubt.
[5819.44 --> 5820.12]  We want to be
[5820.12 --> 5820.70]  a place where
[5820.70 --> 5821.16]  it's okay
[5821.16 --> 5822.30]  to ask hard questions
[5822.30 --> 5823.52]  and to be skeptical
[5823.52 --> 5824.30]  of the answers
[5824.30 --> 5824.96]  that you were given.
[5825.72 --> 5826.32]  I want you to
[5826.32 --> 5827.42]  test and discern
[5827.42 --> 5828.68]  and to engage.
[5829.54 --> 5830.34]  That's what this
[5830.34 --> 5831.34]  series has been about.
[5832.42 --> 5833.48]  Perhaps not so much
[5833.48 --> 5834.34]  answering all of
[5834.34 --> 5835.02]  your questions,
[5835.42 --> 5836.62]  perhaps not spoon
[5836.62 --> 5837.60]  feeding you answers,
[5837.76 --> 5838.62]  but hopefully in the
[5838.62 --> 5839.88]  end, this series
[5839.88 --> 5840.56]  has been about
[5840.56 --> 5842.00]  helping us ask
[5842.00 --> 5842.76]  good questions
[5842.76 --> 5843.74]  and then helping
[5843.74 --> 5844.54]  us together
[5844.54 --> 5846.32]  find answers.
[5847.34 --> 5848.42]  We're not scared
[5848.42 --> 5849.38]  of hard questions
[5849.38 --> 5850.54]  or hard topics,
[5850.70 --> 5851.54]  but let's do it
[5851.54 --> 5851.88]  together.
[5852.50 --> 5853.18]  Let's do it in
[5853.18 --> 5853.64]  community
[5853.64 --> 5855.44]  and for unity
[5855.44 --> 5856.48]  and then looking
[5856.48 --> 5857.62]  to Jesus
[5857.62 --> 5858.46]  and the way
[5858.46 --> 5859.08]  of Jesus
[5859.08 --> 5860.52]  through it all.
[5861.20 --> 5861.46]  Amen?
[5863.22 --> 5863.70]  Amen.
[5864.90 --> 5865.26]  Why don't you
[5865.26 --> 5865.68]  close this in prayer?
[5865.68 --> 5866.06]  Let me pray.
[5867.44 --> 5868.26]  Father in heaven,
[5868.42 --> 5869.22]  we are grateful
[5869.22 --> 5870.08]  that we have
[5870.08 --> 5870.88]  this community
[5870.88 --> 5871.94]  in which we live
[5871.94 --> 5873.44]  in to discuss
[5873.44 --> 5874.50]  these things.
[5874.82 --> 5875.60]  Thank you for
[5875.60 --> 5876.28]  the community
[5876.28 --> 5876.62]  that you have
[5876.62 --> 5877.10]  given us.
[5877.72 --> 5878.44]  Thank you for
[5878.44 --> 5879.26]  your Holy Spirit,
[5879.64 --> 5880.70]  for the story
[5880.70 --> 5881.54]  that you have
[5881.54 --> 5882.96]  given the world
[5882.96 --> 5883.58]  and that we
[5883.58 --> 5884.02]  are part
[5884.02 --> 5884.66]  of this story.
[5885.76 --> 5886.46]  God, as we
[5886.46 --> 5887.22]  move from this
[5887.22 --> 5888.02]  place, both
[5888.02 --> 5889.58]  today, but also
[5889.58 --> 5890.14]  into the week,
[5890.22 --> 5890.70]  into the month,
[5890.76 --> 5891.36]  into the year,
[5891.96 --> 5892.54]  into the rest
[5892.54 --> 5893.06]  of our lives,
[5893.12 --> 5893.56]  God, we just
[5893.56 --> 5894.10]  pray that you
[5894.10 --> 5895.60]  continue to move
[5895.60 --> 5896.06]  in our hearts.
[5896.18 --> 5896.78]  May your Spirit
[5896.78 --> 5898.02]  stir within us
[5898.02 --> 5899.20]  if we find
[5899.20 --> 5899.98]  ourselves angry,
[5900.18 --> 5900.68]  if we find
[5900.68 --> 5902.62]  ourselves doubting.
[5903.18 --> 5903.92]  May we bring
[5903.92 --> 5904.46]  that to you.
[5904.64 --> 5905.10]  May we bring
[5905.10 --> 5906.46]  that to each
[5906.46 --> 5906.70]  other.
[5906.82 --> 5907.54]  May we ask
[5907.54 --> 5908.48]  hard questions.
[5908.76 --> 5909.08]  But God,
[5909.08 --> 5910.56]  we know,
[5910.92 --> 5911.72]  as Pastor Chris
[5911.72 --> 5912.22]  just read,
[5912.96 --> 5914.22]  that you remain
[5914.22 --> 5914.64]  faithful.
[5915.76 --> 5916.12]  And so we
[5916.12 --> 5916.56]  thank you for
[5916.56 --> 5916.74]  that.
[5916.82 --> 5917.50]  May you continue
[5917.50 --> 5919.62]  to fulfill
[5919.62 --> 5920.20]  the promises
[5920.20 --> 5920.88]  that you've
[5920.88 --> 5921.62]  given to us,
[5921.74 --> 5922.40]  promised to us,
[5922.46 --> 5923.18]  and may we
[5923.18 --> 5925.30]  continue to
[5925.30 --> 5926.36]  seek you first
[5926.36 --> 5927.62]  in all of
[5927.62 --> 5927.98]  these things.
[5928.72 --> 5929.16]  We pray this
[5929.16 --> 5929.54]  in your name.
[5929.78 --> 5929.96]  Amen.
[5929.96 --> 5930.04]  Amen.

[5967.80 --> 5968.34]  Amen.
[5968.34 --> 5968.80]  Amen.
[5968.80 --> 5970.80]  won't stop the light
[5970.80 --> 5972.80]  from getting through

[5974.80 --> 5978.90]  do you wish
