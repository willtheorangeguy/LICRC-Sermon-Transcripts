[0.00 → 26.10] In Christ alone, my hope is found
[26.10 → 31.22] And He is my light, my strength, my song
[31.22 → 36.72] This cornerstone, this solid ground
[36.72 → 41.84] Firm through the fiercest drought and storm
[41.84 → 47.46] What heights of love, what depths of peace
[47.46 → 52.68] When fears are still, when strivings cease
[52.68 → 57.84] My comforter, my all in all
[57.84 → 62.68] Here in the love of Christ I stand
[62.68 → 66.94] Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[66.94 → 72.22] Oh-oh-oh-oh aw-oh-oh
[72.22 → 78.68] Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[78.68 → 81.84] Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh query
[81.84 → 88.72] Where in the ground His body lay
[88.72 → 93.92] Light of the world by darkness slain
[93.92 → 99.30] Then bursting forth in glorious day
[99.30 → 104.12] Up from the grave He rose again
[104.12 → 112.02] And as He stands in victory
[112.02 → 117.94] Since curse has lost its grip on me
[117.94 → 123.24] For I am His, and He is mine
[123.24 → 128.64] Bought with the precious blood of Christ
[128.64 → 129.50] Ooh
[129.50 → 136.50] Ooh
[136.50 → 139.50] Ooh
[139.50 → 140.50] Ooh
[140.50 → 143.50] Ooh
[143.50 → 145.50] Ooh
[145.50 → 147.50] Ooh
[147.50 → 151.50] No guilt in life
[151.50 → 153.98] No fear in death
[153.98 → 159.20] This is the power of Christ in me
[159.20 → 164.20] From life's first cry to final breath
[164.20 → 169.20] Jesus commands my destiny
[169.20 → 172.20] No power of hell
[172.20 → 174.20] No scheme of man
[174.20 → 180.20] Can ever pluck me from His hand
[180.20 → 181.20] Till He returns
[181.20 → 182.20] Till He returns
[182.20 → 183.20] Or calls me home
[183.20 → 190.20] Here in the power of Christ I'll stand
[190.20 → 192.20] Oh
[192.20 → 196.20] Oh
[200.20 → 202.20] In Christ alone
[202.20 → 203.40] Christ alone.
[212.40 → 215.98] I find my strength.
[216.30 → 218.52] I find my hope.
[218.94 → 223.74] I find my help in Christ alone.
[223.74 → 228.74] In fear of sails, when darkness falls,
[228.74 → 234.28] I find my peace in Christ alone.
[234.84 → 237.14] I give my life.
[237.50 → 239.66] I give my all.
[240.16 → 244.70] I sing this song to Christ alone.
[245.38 → 247.70] The King of kings.
[248.12 → 250.36] The Lord of all.
[250.36 → 255.14] All heaven sings to Christ alone.
[258.74 → 261.82] To Christ alone.
[264.54 → 267.10] In Christ alone.
[267.10 → 272.58] To Christ alone.
[274.30 → 278.60] To Christ alone.
[278.60 → 297.30] Until he returns or calls me home
[297.30 → 302.60] And here in the power of Christ I still...
[308.60 → 331.60] Hear, O Israel
[331.60 → 340.60] The people of the Lord
[341.16 → 350.92] Be still and know that he is God
[350.92 → 359.36] Love the Lord your God
[359.36 → 366.66] With the fullness of your heart
[366.66 → 371.48] With all your mind
[371.48 → 378.48] Your strength and soul
[378.48 → 385.48] We draw near through Christ
[385.48 → 390.48] Who saves us
[390.48 → 403.48] We draw near to the throne of grace
[403.48 → 409.48] Hear, O Israel
[409.48 → 418.38] The people of the Lord
[418.38 → 422.58] Come lift your voice
[422.58 → 427.48] And praise your King
[427.48 → 432.48] A love sending
[432.48 → 447.48] My Saviour
[447.48 → 448.48] The people of the Lord
[448.48 → 449.48] Come lift your voice
[449.48 → 450.48] The people of the Lord
[450.48 → 452.48] Come lift your voice
[452.48 → 453.48] And praise your King
[453.48 → 456.48] Allah sent in my Saviour
[456.48 → 457.48] The people of the Lord
[457.48 → 462.48] He ended my sovereign die
[462.48 → 469.48] Then did my sovereign die
[469.48 → 478.48] But he devolved that sacred end
[478.48 → 485.48] For such a worm as I
[485.48 → 494.48] Was it for crimes that I had done
[494.48 → 502.48] Though he crawled down upon the tree
[502.48 → 510.48] Amazing, magic, grace unknown
[510.48 → 515.48] Living in love beyond the tree
[515.48 → 517.48] Am I the sun in darkness as I
[517.48 → 520.48] Be the sun in darkness as I
[520.48 → 523.48] Be the sun in darkness as I
[523.48 → 533.48] Then shed his glory sing
[533.48 → 535.48] Am I the sun in darkness as I
[535.48 → 539.48] Am I the sun in darkness as I
[539.48 → 544.48] Then shed his glory sing
[544.48 → 550.48] Am I the sun in darkness as I
[550.48 → 556.76] Was the mighty maker I,
[556.76 → 564.76] O'er man the creature's sin?
[564.76 → 573.48] Thus might I hide my blushing face,
[573.48 → 581.48] While his deep loss of peace
[581.48 → 590.48] Dissolve my heart in faithfulness,
[590.48 → 599.48] And help my eyes with tears.
[603.48 → 619.48] The drops of grief can't repay,
[619.48 → 628.48] The debt of love I owe.
[628.48 → 636.48] Here, Lord, I give myself away,
[636.48 → 644.48] This all that I can do.
[644.48 → 652.48] How blessed did my Saviour plead,
[652.48 → 660.48] And did my sovereign God.
[660.48 → 670.48] Amazing, dirty grace unknown,
[670.48 → 678.48] And love beyond the sea.
[678.48 → 688.48] I give myself away,
[688.48 → 690.48] And did my sovereign God.
[690.48 → 698.48] Amen.
[698.48 → 703.48] Tonight, we remember Jesus,
[703.48 → 707.48] Who in darkness died on the cross.
[707.48 → 709.48] Tonight, we remember Jesus,
[709.48 → 714.48] Who in dying bore punishment of sin.
[714.48 → 716.48] Tonight, we remember Jesus,
[716.48 → 721.48] Who in death endured being forsaken by God the Father.
[721.48 → 727.48] Tonight, we enter into the darkness of the Friday called good.
[727.48 → 731.48] Because God calls us to worship,
[731.48 → 735.48] And welcomes us into his presence.
[735.48 → 738.48] Receive the greeting of our God.
[738.48 → 740.48] The Lord be with you.
[740.48 → 747.48] May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[747.48 → 748.48] And the love of God the Father,
[748.48 → 751.48] And the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,
[751.48 → 752.48] Be with you all.
[752.48 → 753.48] Amen.
[753.48 → 754.48] Amen.
[783.48 → 793.48] Amen.
[793.48 → 804.22] O sacred head, thou wounded, with grief and shame may drown.
[804.22 → 816.54] Thou storm fully surrounded, with thrones your holy crown.
[816.54 → 829.50] O sacred head of glory, and blessing you have known.
[829.50 → 842.50] Yet through disguise and glory, I claim you as my own.
[842.50 → 857.50] I thought that you did suffer, was all for sin as gay.
[857.50 → 872.50] Mine, mine was the transgression, but cures the deadly pain.
[872.50 → 889.88] So here I kneel, my Saviour, for I deserve your place.
[889.88 → 906.88] Look on me with your favour, and save me by your grace.
[906.88 → 922.88] What language shall I borrow, to thank you, dearest friend?
[922.88 → 940.88] Lord, this is your dying sorrow, your mercy without end.
[940.88 → 956.88] Lord, make me yours forever, a loyal servant true.
[956.88 → 973.88] Lord, let me never, never outlive my love for you.
[973.88 → 1001.98] Dear God, O crucified Jesus, Son the Father, conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, eternal word of God, we worship you.
[1003.88 → 1015.24] O crucified Jesus, holy temple of God, dwelling place of the Most High, gate of heaven, burning flame of love, we worship you.
[1017.24 → 1026.82] O crucified Jesus, sanctuary of justice and love, full of kindness, source of all faithfulness, we worship you.
[1026.82 → 1037.62] O crucified Jesus, ruler of every heart, in you are the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
[1037.80 → 1041.18] In you dwell all the fullness of the Godhead.
[1042.06 → 1043.16] We worship you.
[1045.98 → 1049.86] Jesus, Lamb of God, have mercy on us.
[1051.22 → 1055.42] Jesus, bearer of our sins, have mercy on us.
[1055.42 → 1059.92] Jesus, Redeemer of the world, grant us peace.
[1063.96 → 1068.08] Almighty God, look with mercy on your family.
[1069.14 → 1076.50] For whom our Lord Jesus Christ was willing to be betrayed and to be given over to the hands of sinners
[1076.50 → 1086.76] and to suffer death on the cross through him who now lives and reigns with you in the Holy Spirit,
[1087.36 → 1089.14] one God forever and ever.
[1090.22 → 1090.58] Amen.
[1090.58 → 1090.72] Amen.
[1090.72 → 1090.78] Amen.
[1090.78 → 1090.80] Amen.
[1090.80 → 1094.72] Amen.
[1094.72 → 1098.72] Amen.
[1098.72 → 1100.72] Amen.
[1100.72 → 1102.72] Amen.
[1102.72 → 1103.72] Amen.
[1103.72 → 1104.22] Amen.
[1104.22 → 1104.64] Amen.
[1104.64 → 1104.72] Amen.
[1104.72 → 1104.76] Amen.
[1106.50 → 1136.48] Amen.
[1136.50 → 1136.76] Amen.
[1136.76 → 1137.06] Amen.
[1137.06 → 1137.34] Amen.
[1152.84 → 1166.00] Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
[1166.00 → 1178.00] Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
[1178.00 → 1195.00] Lord, sometimes it causes me to tremble.
[1195.00 → 1202.00] Tremble, tremble.
[1202.00 → 1215.00] Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
[1215.00 → 1230.00] Were you there when they nailed Him to the tree?
[1230.00 → 1237.00] Were you there when they nailed Him to the tree?
[1237.00 → 1244.00] Oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble.
[1244.00 → 1259.00] Oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble.
[1259.00 → 1266.00] Tremble, tremble.
[1266.00 → 1269.00] Tremble, tremble.
[1269.00 → 1281.00] Were you there when they nailed Him to the tree?
[1281.00 → 1296.00] Were you there when they laid Him in the tree?
[1296.00 → 1311.00] Were you there when they laid Him in the tree?
[1311.00 → 1318.00] Oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble.
[1318.00 → 1325.00] Sometimes it causes me to tremble.
[1325.00 → 1333.00] Tremble, tremble.
[1333.00 → 1339.00] Tremble, tremble.
[1339.00 → 1354.00] Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb?
[1354.00 → 1355.00] Were you there when you paddle?
[1356.00 → 1361.00] I am.
[1361.00 → 1377.28] hydrated and
[1377.28 → 1381.80] People with Jorge
[1384.00 → 1408.00] Death Be Not Proud, The World Fear You
[1408.00 → 1415.00] Mighty and dreadful You may seem
[1415.00 → 1424.00] Death Be Not Proud, For Your Pride Has Filled You
[1424.00 → 1431.00] You Will Not Kill Me
[1431.00 → 1440.00] Though You May Dwell In Plague And Poison
[1440.00 → 1447.00] You Are Slave To Fate And Desperate Men
[1447.00 → 1456.00] So Death If You Are Sleep Be The Gates To Heaven
[1456.00 → 1471.00] Why Your Confidence When You Will Be No More
[1471.00 → 1476.00] Why Your Will Be No More
[1476.00 → 1480.00] No More
[1480.00 → 1488.00] Why Your Will Be No More
[1488.00 → 1495.00] Even Death Will Die
[1495.00 → 1505.00] Even Death Will Die
[1505.00 → 1511.00] Death Be Not Proud
[1511.00 → 1518.00] Death Be Not Proud
[1518.00 → 1522.00] Death Be Not Proud
[1522.00 → 1526.00] Death Be Not Proud
[1526.00 → 1548.00] Death Again
[1548.00 → 1554.00] Death Be Not Proud
[1554.00 → 1566.64] We're going to take some time together tonight in the story of Good Friday, and we're going
[1566.64 → 1571.30] to pick up a part of that story that takes place just before the crucifixion.
[1571.30 → 1574.68] It is the trail of Peter.
[1575.38 → 1579.92] If you have a Bible, I invite you to open that up and to find the text there.
[1580.00 → 1581.52] I'm going to read from Luke 22.
[1581.52 → 1584.96] We're going to read verse 54 to 62.
[1585.54 → 1588.86] You can follow along on the screen, but also with the Bible in your hands.
[1591.74 → 1593.82] Before we read, let me pray.
[1597.68 → 1603.00] Lord Jesus, take your word and plant it deep in our hearts tonight.
[1603.00 → 1611.78] Water it by your spirit, that it may grow and produce fruit in our lives.
[1613.04 → 1618.28] In the hearing of your word, may we see Jesus more clearly tonight.
[1619.44 → 1626.36] May our hearts' affections for you be stirred as we are drawn into your presence.
[1626.36 → 1631.28] May your voice be clear.
[1633.42 → 1636.22] Our faith made more alive.
[1637.46 → 1640.94] We come to the cross and remember your death.
[1642.18 → 1643.24] In Jesus' name we pray.
[1644.38 → 1644.58] Amen.
[1644.58 → 1648.90] Luke 22.
[1648.90 → 1657.86] Then, seizing him, Jesus, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest.
[1658.92 → 1660.46] Peter followed at a distance.
[1661.80 → 1666.62] And when some there had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together,
[1667.76 → 1668.98] Peter sat down with them.
[1668.98 → 1673.30] A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight.
[1674.20 → 1676.18] She looked closely at him and said,
[1676.96 → 1678.56] This man was with them.
[1679.54 → 1680.78] But he denied it.
[1681.78 → 1683.30] Woman, I don't know you.
[1683.48 → 1684.76] I don't know him, he said.
[1686.28 → 1688.82] A little later, someone else saw him and said,
[1689.56 → 1691.38] You also are one of them.
[1692.10 → 1694.36] Man, I am not, Peter replied.
[1694.36 → 1699.48] About an hour later, another asserted,
[1700.38 → 1704.60] Certainly, this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean.
[1706.32 → 1707.00] Peter replied,
[1707.12 → 1709.52] Man, I don't know what you're talking about.
[1710.52 → 1714.04] Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed.
[1715.32 → 1719.46] The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter.
[1719.46 → 1724.78] And then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him.
[1726.12 → 1730.96] Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.
[1731.92 → 1735.78] He went outside, wept bitterly.
[1737.12 → 1738.34] That's the word of the Lord.
[1738.34 → 1751.28] Begin tonight, I want to just set the stage by following the timeline of events
[1751.28 → 1754.50] that sort of gets to the story as we have read it.
[1756.10 → 1758.68] The Passover meal has concluded.
[1758.86 → 1761.88] Now, the Passover meal starts the day.
[1762.88 → 1766.66] So in the Jewish calendar, the day starts after sunset.
[1766.66 → 1771.82] And in Israel, about this time of year, around Passover, it's about 7 p.m.
[1773.38 → 1777.72] Now, after the meal, Jesus teaches his disciples about greatness.
[1778.28 → 1781.14] And then he makes a prophecy about Peter's denial.
[1782.24 → 1788.86] And then after Peter's denial, there is a story of Jesus travelling to the Mount of Olives to pray,
[1789.16 → 1790.60] as he would normally do.
[1790.74 → 1794.16] And by this time, it's already getting late in the evening.
[1794.16 → 1801.18] Now, the disciples are chastised for falling asleep while Jesus is praying.
[1801.44 → 1805.16] And so I think it's safe to assume that it's probably around midnight.
[1805.16 → 1813.84] And then you get the story in verse 47 and 48 of Jesus being revealed to the chief priests
[1813.84 → 1818.98] and the gang of people who have come to arrest him by the betrayal of Judas' kiss.
[1819.78 → 1823.46] And then once he is arrested, he is taken to the high priest house,
[1823.60 → 1825.12] and that's the high priest Caiaphas.
[1825.12 → 1830.22] And then we get the story that we read, the story of Peter's three denials.
[1831.22 → 1836.10] The story comes to a close as the rooster crows in verse 60, and Peter remembers.
[1836.38 → 1841.38] And then verse 66, which we didn't read, begins with the little phrase,
[1841.88 → 1843.16] at daybreak.
[1844.00 → 1849.74] Now, again, at about this time of year in Israel, that would be around 6.30 in the morning.
[1849.74 → 1857.42] Now, a formal trial of the Sanhedrin in order to pass a death sentence could only happen after daybreak.
[1858.08 → 1860.20] Now, it's unusual to do that on a feast day.
[1860.28 → 1862.96] This is still Passover day, but it's not unheard of.
[1863.76 → 1866.00] Now, why do I spell that out for you?
[1866.06 → 1868.88] Why do we trace that timeline?
[1868.88 → 1883.66] I want to do that because it means that Peter's three denials probably occurred over a three-to-six-hour period.
[1885.18 → 1893.88] Three-to-six hours, long through the night, a whole night of hiding who he is,
[1893.94 → 1896.48] a whole night of hiding the truth.
[1898.88 → 1910.04] When I think about this story, I think about the times in my life where I've spent a whole night hiding the truth about who I am.
[1910.86 → 1914.66] A whole night hiding the truth about who Jesus is.
[1915.94 → 1920.94] When I was younger, and I was at a party doing things that I shouldn't have been doing,
[1921.18 → 1924.64] I spent a whole night denying the truth about who I am.
[1924.64 → 1928.66] A whole night denying the reality that the next day I was supposed to get up and go to church.
[1929.80 → 1934.62] And in doing that, I spent the whole night denying Jesus.
[1935.92 → 1937.56] Maybe for you, it happens at work.
[1938.30 → 1938.50] Right?
[1938.54 → 1940.04] There's a conversation that's happening,
[1940.04 → 1944.54] and jokes are being told that you know you probably shouldn't laugh at,
[1944.82 → 1946.60] but you kind of just lower your head.
[1946.92 → 1949.96] You half-smile if someone makes eye contact with you.
[1950.08 → 1950.94] You try to hide.
[1951.04 → 1952.10] You're trying to fit in.
[1952.40 → 1952.54] Right?
[1952.56 → 1954.06] You're afraid to be called out.
[1955.54 → 1956.78] You're denying Jesus.
[1958.44 → 1959.22] In fact,
[1959.22 → 1963.54] anytime you wilfully disobey,
[1963.68 → 1963.84] right,
[1963.96 → 1966.60] wilful, regular patterns of disobedience,
[1966.86 → 1969.00] you're denying Jesus.
[1970.68 → 1973.46] Maybe it's pornography for you, right?
[1973.46 → 1976.68] In that you are wilfully denying Jesus,
[1976.90 → 1977.48] who said,
[1977.92 → 1982.24] anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has committed adultery in their heart.
[1983.02 → 1983.56] Or,
[1983.64 → 1986.22] anytime you refuse to forgive someone,
[1986.50 → 1989.24] you are denying the voice of Jesus,
[1989.44 → 1990.02] who says,
[1990.38 → 1992.22] bear with each other and forgive one another.
[1992.22 → 1994.36] And if any of you has a grievance against someone,
[1994.78 → 1997.66] forgive as the Lord forgave you.
[1999.06 → 2001.66] This is what I hope we can see together tonight.
[2002.36 → 2004.50] And it comes in two parts.
[2005.14 → 2005.46] First,
[2006.40 → 2007.42] Peter's rejection
[2007.42 → 2010.40] is my rejection.
[2011.94 → 2013.00] And then second,
[2013.30 → 2014.32] what we'll see is that
[2014.32 → 2015.48] Jesus' rejection
[2015.48 → 2018.32] is my salvation.
[2019.64 → 2020.60] Peter's rejection
[2020.60 → 2021.64] is my rejection,
[2021.64 → 2022.88] and Jesus' rejection
[2022.88 → 2024.76] is my salvation.
[2025.34 → 2026.34] To that first point then,
[2026.52 → 2027.88] let's start with a question.
[2028.84 → 2031.04] How is disobedience
[2031.04 → 2033.18] the same as denying?
[2035.04 → 2036.88] When you hang on to forgiveness,
[2037.32 → 2038.36] when you keep doing
[2038.36 → 2040.00] what you know in your head
[2040.00 → 2042.48] to be contrary to God's will for you,
[2042.72 → 2044.98] you are revealing in your heart
[2044.98 → 2046.80] that you aren't really sure
[2046.80 → 2047.84] Jesus was right.
[2049.10 → 2049.28] Right?
[2049.30 → 2050.80] When we chose or choose
[2050.80 → 2052.64] what we know to be sin
[2052.64 → 2054.84] over what we know to be right,
[2054.96 → 2056.06] we're denying Jesus.
[2056.50 → 2058.86] Denying that God's design for our life
[2058.86 → 2060.40] is really for our joy.
[2061.40 → 2061.86] Instead,
[2062.20 → 2063.42] we think that porn
[2063.42 → 2064.82] has a greater joy to offer.
[2065.14 → 2066.72] We think that social acceptance
[2066.72 → 2067.86] at work or school
[2067.86 → 2068.42] will yield
[2068.42 → 2070.08] a greater joy
[2070.08 → 2071.16] in our lives.
[2072.46 → 2073.62] We're going to dig deep
[2073.62 → 2074.68] for a moment,
[2074.82 → 2076.12] and so let's think
[2076.12 → 2077.38] theologically
[2077.38 → 2078.64] together.
[2080.50 → 2081.26] Hebrews 12
[2081.26 → 2082.48] says that
[2082.48 → 2084.28] Jesus endured the cross
[2084.28 → 2085.48] for the joy
[2085.48 → 2087.22] set before him.
[2088.22 → 2088.48] Now,
[2088.86 → 2090.40] don't hear what I'm not saying.
[2091.02 → 2091.16] Right?
[2091.22 → 2091.78] The cross
[2091.78 → 2093.18] is not joy.
[2093.52 → 2095.12] What comes after the cross
[2095.12 → 2095.64] is joy.
[2095.72 → 2096.24] The cross
[2096.24 → 2097.08] is a curse.
[2097.36 → 2097.84] The cross
[2097.84 → 2098.38] is death.
[2098.50 → 2098.88] The cross
[2098.88 → 2099.58] is punishment
[2099.58 → 2100.48] for sin.
[2100.48 → 2101.12] The cross
[2101.12 → 2101.74] is pain
[2101.74 → 2102.36] and agony
[2102.36 → 2103.40] and forsakenness.
[2103.66 → 2104.36] The cross
[2104.36 → 2105.36] is rejection.
[2106.62 → 2107.82] Jesus endured
[2107.82 → 2108.54] death,
[2109.08 → 2109.46] punishment
[2109.46 → 2110.14] for sin
[2110.14 → 2111.22] that he did not commit.
[2111.52 → 2112.10] He endured
[2112.10 → 2113.02] being forsaken
[2113.02 → 2114.00] by the Father
[2114.00 → 2114.80] on the cross
[2114.80 → 2115.90] for the joy
[2115.90 → 2116.94] that would come
[2116.94 → 2117.84] after.
[2120.22 → 2120.42] Now,
[2120.46 → 2121.24] the Christ hymn
[2121.24 → 2122.52] of Philippians 2
[2122.52 → 2123.78] helps us fill this out.
[2124.20 → 2124.30] Right?
[2124.36 → 2124.92] The Christ hymn
[2124.92 → 2125.64] in Philippians 2
[2125.64 → 2126.44] says that Jesus
[2126.44 → 2128.28] had to learn obedience
[2128.28 → 2129.62] and that that obedience
[2129.62 → 2130.94] took him to death,
[2131.00 → 2131.64] even death
[2131.64 → 2132.64] on the cross
[2132.64 → 2134.38] and because of that
[2134.38 → 2135.36] he is exalted
[2135.36 → 2137.16] to the highest place.
[2137.24 → 2138.18] He is raised up
[2138.18 → 2139.60] as ruler over all
[2139.60 → 2141.28] and how does the Christ hymn
[2141.28 → 2142.12] of Philippians 2
[2142.12 → 2142.72] then end?
[2143.72 → 2144.32] It says,
[2145.16 → 2145.72] every tongue
[2145.72 → 2146.66] will confess
[2146.66 → 2147.38] that Jesus
[2147.38 → 2148.22] is Lord,
[2149.32 → 2150.12] the glory
[2150.12 → 2151.44] God
[2151.44 → 2152.58] Father.
[2153.46 → 2154.66] The joy
[2154.66 → 2155.60] that was
[2155.60 → 2156.78] before him
[2156.78 → 2157.72] that enabled him
[2157.72 → 2159.22] to endure the cross
[2159.22 → 2160.30] is the glory
[2160.30 → 2160.96] is the glory of God.
[2162.08 → 2162.82] The joy
[2162.82 → 2163.74] that was set
[2163.74 → 2164.46] before him
[2164.46 → 2165.26] that caused him
[2165.26 → 2166.30] to empty himself
[2166.30 → 2167.64] and to learn obedience,
[2167.72 → 2168.36] even obedience
[2168.36 → 2168.98] unto death
[2168.98 → 2169.90] on the cross
[2169.90 → 2170.88] was the glory
[2170.88 → 2171.70] of God,
[2171.78 → 2172.26] the Father.
[2172.86 → 2174.24] Everything Jesus did,
[2174.36 → 2175.54] everything he endured,
[2175.68 → 2176.22] he did
[2176.22 → 2177.24] for the glory
[2177.24 → 2177.92] of God.
[2179.66 → 2180.72] And so this
[2180.72 → 2181.74] question
[2181.74 → 2183.56] begins to emerge.
[2184.40 → 2184.50] Right?
[2184.50 → 2187.00] What enables you
[2187.00 → 2188.16] now
[2188.16 → 2189.16] to choose
[2189.16 → 2189.76] obedience
[2189.76 → 2190.96] in the hard
[2190.96 → 2191.64] places?
[2193.64 → 2194.18] For the joy
[2194.18 → 2195.54] set before you
[2195.54 → 2197.22] take up the cross
[2197.22 → 2198.20] and follow him.
[2198.72 → 2198.84] Right?
[2198.88 → 2199.54] Because the joy
[2199.54 → 2200.74] that's set before you
[2200.74 → 2201.16] too
[2201.16 → 2202.10] right here
[2202.10 → 2202.80] and right now
[2202.80 → 2203.48] as you daily
[2203.48 → 2204.32] take up your cross
[2204.32 → 2205.42] is the glory
[2205.42 → 2206.08] of God.
[2207.36 → 2208.22] What does Paul say
[2208.22 → 2209.14] in Romans 8?
[2209.14 → 2210.32] that I consider
[2210.32 → 2211.72] our present sufferings
[2211.72 → 2212.48] are not worth
[2212.48 → 2213.02] comparing
[2213.02 → 2214.06] to the glory
[2214.06 → 2214.90] that will be
[2214.90 → 2215.82] revealed in us.
[2216.44 → 2218.10] God will be glorified
[2218.10 → 2219.26] and your joy
[2219.26 → 2220.52] is the glorifying
[2220.52 → 2221.38] of God.
[2221.50 → 2222.20] You're suffering
[2222.20 → 2223.40] now will be used
[2223.40 → 2224.48] to magnify
[2224.48 → 2225.36] the glory
[2225.36 → 2226.18] of God then.
[2226.46 → 2227.10] Your obedience
[2227.10 → 2228.28] now will be used
[2228.28 → 2229.28] to magnify
[2229.28 → 2230.12] the glory
[2230.12 → 2230.90] of God then.
[2233.02 → 2233.72] Let me
[2233.72 → 2235.02] spell this out
[2235.02 → 2236.24] for you
[2236.24 → 2236.62] in a way
[2236.62 → 2237.54] that might work
[2237.54 → 2238.66] for those of you
[2238.66 → 2239.70] math-brained
[2239.70 → 2240.44] sort of people.
[2241.34 → 2241.88] Maybe you
[2241.88 → 2242.68] remember this
[2242.68 → 2243.98] from high school math
[2243.98 → 2244.26] right?
[2244.42 → 2245.34] A equals B
[2245.34 → 2246.90] B equals C
[2246.90 → 2247.68] therefore
[2247.68 → 2250.90] A equals C
[2250.90 → 2252.22] right?
[2252.26 → 2252.66] That's called
[2252.66 → 2254.14] the transitive property.
[2255.34 → 2255.74] Now let's put
[2255.74 → 2256.80] what we have just
[2256.80 → 2257.44] seen
[2257.44 → 2258.60] through that
[2258.60 → 2259.38] formula.
[2260.62 → 2261.34] Your joy
[2261.34 → 2262.38] equals
[2262.38 → 2263.70] glorifying God.
[2264.70 → 2265.84] Glorifying God
[2265.84 → 2266.64] equals
[2266.64 → 2268.02] your obedience
[2268.02 → 2269.06] therefore
[2269.06 → 2270.92] your obedience
[2270.92 → 2271.94] equals
[2271.94 → 2273.20] your joy.
[2274.56 → 2274.68] Right?
[2274.72 → 2275.40] Are you tracking
[2275.40 → 2276.40] with me in this?
[2276.50 → 2277.36] The Bible says
[2277.36 → 2278.22] that your
[2278.22 → 2279.50] the greatest joy
[2279.50 → 2280.40] comes from
[2280.40 → 2281.60] glorifying God
[2281.60 → 2282.32] from being
[2282.32 → 2283.42] fully human
[2283.42 → 2284.06] and alive
[2284.06 → 2284.50] in Him
[2284.50 → 2284.92] from being
[2284.92 → 2285.80] fully obedient
[2285.80 → 2286.36] to Him
[2286.36 → 2287.26] and even
[2287.26 → 2287.98] though Jesus'
[2288.26 → 2288.66] obedience
[2288.66 → 2289.32] took Him
[2289.32 → 2290.00] to the cross
[2290.00 → 2290.70] He endured
[2290.70 → 2291.18] it because
[2291.18 → 2292.06] of the joy
[2292.06 → 2292.68] that would
[2292.68 → 2293.04] follow.
[2293.16 → 2293.70] He endured
[2293.70 → 2294.14] it because
[2294.14 → 2295.20] of the glory
[2295.20 → 2295.76] it brings
[2295.76 → 2296.20] to God
[2296.20 → 2297.06] the Father.
[2298.48 → 2299.12] Now there's
[2299.12 → 2299.96] a thought
[2299.96 → 2300.76] here.
[2302.12 → 2302.56] Right?
[2302.58 → 2303.04] What does this
[2303.04 → 2303.84] mean for our
[2303.84 → 2304.76] suffering?
[2304.88 → 2305.20] What does this
[2305.20 → 2305.68] mean for our
[2305.68 → 2306.38] trials?
[2306.52 → 2306.76] For our
[2306.76 → 2307.48] taking up
[2307.48 → 2308.10] our crosses?
[2308.24 → 2308.34] Right?
[2308.38 → 2308.74] If your
[2308.74 → 2309.22] obedience
[2309.22 → 2309.94] to the will
[2309.94 → 2310.38] of God
[2310.38 → 2310.98] brings trial
[2310.98 → 2311.40] and hardship
[2311.40 → 2311.86] and struggle
[2311.86 → 2312.36] and you can
[2312.36 → 2313.12] proceed through
[2313.12 → 2313.70] it because
[2313.70 → 2314.20] of the same
[2314.20 → 2314.64] joy that
[2314.64 → 2314.96] is set
[2314.96 → 2315.70] before you
[2315.70 → 2317.26] what is
[2317.26 → 2317.58] that
[2317.58 → 2318.60] joy?
[2319.24 → 2319.84] And that's a
[2319.84 → 2320.30] thought, and we're
[2320.30 → 2320.62] going to come
[2320.62 → 2321.18] back to that
[2321.18 → 2321.90] in a moment
[2321.90 → 2322.72] so just know
[2322.72 → 2323.18] that we will
[2323.18 → 2323.54] get there
[2323.54 → 2324.02] but park
[2324.02 → 2324.48] it for a
[2324.48 → 2324.66] minute.
[2325.70 → 2326.18] But right
[2326.18 → 2328.10] now since
[2328.10 → 2329.16] it is true
[2329.16 → 2330.90] that glorifying
[2330.90 → 2331.90] God is my
[2331.90 → 2332.54] joy and
[2332.54 → 2333.30] obedience to
[2333.30 → 2334.52] God glorifies
[2334.52 → 2335.20] Him therefore
[2335.20 → 2336.46] obedience is
[2336.46 → 2337.40] my joy since
[2337.40 → 2338.16] that is true
[2338.16 → 2339.72] anytime you
[2339.72 → 2341.54] choose disobedience
[2341.54 → 2342.94] you are spurning
[2342.94 → 2343.96] the glory of
[2343.96 → 2344.30] God.
[2345.42 → 2346.46] Anytime you
[2346.46 → 2347.84] choose disobedience
[2347.84 → 2348.58] you are saying
[2348.58 → 2349.38] the glory of
[2349.38 → 2350.30] God is not
[2350.30 → 2351.26] my
[2351.26 → 2352.20] joy
[2352.20 → 2353.88] but Jesus
[2353.88 → 2355.00] is not
[2355.00 → 2355.54] my joy.
[2356.74 → 2357.36] John says
[2357.36 → 2358.32] in the opening
[2358.32 → 2359.08] chapter of
[2359.08 → 2360.00] his gospel
[2360.00 → 2360.44] that we have
[2360.44 → 2361.42] seen the glory
[2361.42 → 2362.18] of the one
[2362.18 → 2362.96] and only
[2362.96 → 2363.66] come from
[2363.66 → 2364.20] the Father
[2364.20 → 2365.22] full of
[2365.22 → 2365.90] grace and
[2365.90 → 2366.28] truth.
[2367.02 → 2367.78] Colossians 1
[2367.78 → 2368.18] makes it
[2368.18 → 2368.84] abundantly clear
[2368.84 → 2369.40] that Jesus
[2369.40 → 2370.68] is the glory
[2370.68 → 2371.46] of God
[2371.46 → 2372.50] made visible
[2372.50 → 2373.08] he is the
[2373.08 → 2373.62] image of
[2373.62 → 2374.26] the invisible
[2374.26 → 2374.74] God
[2374.74 → 2375.72] Jesus is
[2375.72 → 2376.38] the perfect
[2376.38 → 2377.68] picture of
[2377.68 → 2378.18] obedience
[2378.18 → 2378.78] and Jesus
[2378.78 → 2379.44] shows us
[2379.44 → 2379.78] what it
[2379.78 → 2380.60] looks like
[2380.60 → 2381.18] to really
[2381.18 → 2381.98] be fully
[2381.98 → 2382.46] human
[2382.46 → 2383.64] fully alive
[2383.64 → 2384.00] and when
[2384.00 → 2384.52] you choose
[2384.52 → 2385.34] something other
[2385.34 → 2386.10] than him
[2386.10 → 2388.06] you are in
[2388.06 → 2390.24] fact denying
[2390.24 → 2391.38] him.
[2393.20 → 2394.12] When you
[2394.12 → 2395.10] make your
[2395.10 → 2395.60] career
[2395.60 → 2397.14] your goal
[2397.14 → 2398.16] in life
[2398.16 → 2398.68] and the
[2398.68 → 2399.36] source of
[2399.36 → 2400.32] your meaning
[2400.32 → 2401.12] and identity
[2401.12 → 2402.04] in the world
[2402.04 → 2403.30] you are denying
[2403.30 → 2403.84] Jesus
[2403.84 → 2405.22] who said
[2405.22 → 2406.64] seek first
[2406.64 → 2407.46] the kingdom
[2407.46 → 2408.60] and his
[2408.60 → 2409.20] righteousness
[2409.20 → 2410.42] and these
[2410.42 → 2410.96] things will
[2410.96 → 2411.46] be added
[2411.46 → 2412.26] to you.
[2413.28 → 2413.62] When you
[2413.62 → 2414.60] refuse to
[2414.60 → 2415.42] love your
[2415.42 → 2416.06] wife the
[2416.06 → 2416.64] way Jesus
[2416.64 → 2417.38] loved the
[2417.38 → 2417.72] church
[2417.72 → 2418.76] giving himself
[2418.76 → 2419.52] up for her
[2419.52 → 2420.20] or when you
[2420.20 → 2421.26] don't respect
[2421.26 → 2422.04] your husband
[2422.04 → 2422.82] as the man
[2422.82 → 2423.26] that God
[2423.26 → 2423.74] has given
[2423.74 → 2424.14] you to
[2424.14 → 2424.96] reveal himself
[2424.96 → 2425.32] through
[2425.32 → 2426.28] you are both
[2426.28 → 2426.86] denying
[2426.86 → 2427.40] Jesus
[2427.40 → 2427.86] because
[2427.86 → 2428.56] marriage
[2428.56 → 2429.16] is a
[2429.16 → 2429.96] lived picture
[2429.96 → 2430.32] of the
[2430.32 → 2430.74] gospel
[2430.74 → 2431.66] according to
[2431.66 → 2432.50] Ephesians 5.
[2433.38 → 2433.68] When you
[2433.68 → 2434.26] don't honour
[2434.26 → 2435.00] your parents
[2435.00 → 2435.34] but you
[2435.34 → 2435.72] fight
[2435.72 → 2436.32] and you
[2436.32 → 2436.76] lie
[2436.76 → 2437.22] you are
[2437.22 → 2437.72] denying
[2437.72 → 2438.70] Jesus
[2438.70 → 2440.14] when you
[2440.14 → 2440.60] hang on to
[2440.60 → 2440.94] bitterness
[2440.94 → 2442.02] or malice
[2442.02 → 2442.86] or rage
[2442.86 → 2443.46] you are
[2443.46 → 2444.02] denying
[2444.02 → 2445.36] Jesus
[2445.36 → 2451.56] disobedience
[2451.56 → 2452.80] to the
[2452.80 → 2453.18] will
[2453.18 → 2454.56] and design
[2454.56 → 2455.36] of God
[2455.36 → 2456.68] isn't just
[2456.68 → 2458.32] an innocuous
[2458.32 → 2459.36] alternative way
[2459.36 → 2459.90] of living
[2459.90 → 2460.96] in the world
[2460.96 → 2461.46] it is a
[2461.46 → 2461.96] rejection
[2461.96 → 2463.12] of the joy
[2463.12 → 2463.70] that God
[2463.70 → 2464.52] has for you
[2464.52 → 2464.98] it's a
[2464.98 → 2465.88] repudiation
[2465.88 → 2466.70] of God's
[2466.70 → 2467.20] plan for
[2467.20 → 2467.74] his glory
[2467.74 → 2468.18] it is a
[2468.18 → 2468.70] denial
[2468.70 → 2469.74] of Jesus
[2469.74 → 2472.38] it's a
[2472.38 → 2472.76] rejection
[2472.76 → 2473.58] of why
[2473.58 → 2474.04] Jesus
[2474.04 → 2474.60] had to
[2474.60 → 2474.88] come
[2474.88 → 2475.80] into the
[2475.80 → 2476.14] world
[2476.14 → 2478.10] 2 Corinthians
[2478.10 → 2478.92] 5.21
[2478.92 → 2479.44] says that
[2479.44 → 2479.80] God
[2479.80 → 2480.58] made him
[2480.58 → 2480.96] who
[2480.96 → 2481.80] had no
[2481.80 → 2482.06] sin
[2482.06 → 2482.60] to be
[2482.60 → 2482.84] sin
[2482.84 → 2483.40] for us
[2483.40 → 2483.76] so that
[2483.76 → 2484.26] in him
[2484.26 → 2484.94] we might
[2484.94 → 2485.46] become
[2485.46 → 2485.78] the
[2485.78 → 2486.28] righteousness
[2486.28 → 2487.70] of God
[2487.70 → 2490.38] he who
[2490.38 → 2490.82] was
[2490.82 → 2491.36] never
[2491.36 → 2492.38] disobedient
[2492.38 → 2493.32] bore the
[2493.32 → 2493.98] disobedience
[2493.98 → 2494.28] of us
[2494.28 → 2494.56] all
[2494.56 → 2494.96] so that
[2494.96 → 2495.52] we might
[2495.52 → 2496.12] be counted
[2496.12 → 2497.36] obedient
[2497.36 → 2499.58] to deny
[2499.58 → 2500.64] him
[2500.64 → 2501.34] is to
[2501.34 → 2501.84] deny
[2501.84 → 2502.78] this
[2502.78 → 2503.88] truth
[2503.88 → 2505.08] and instead
[2505.08 → 2506.78] we are
[2506.78 → 2507.28] all
[2507.28 → 2508.82] every one
[2508.82 → 2509.38] of us
[2509.38 → 2510.72] Peters
[2510.72 → 2513.28] here
[2513.28 → 2515.90] crucible
[2515.90 → 2516.44] moment
[2516.44 → 2518.14] we are
[2518.14 → 2518.46] Peter
[2518.46 → 2519.90] I am
[2519.90 → 2520.58] Peter
[2520.58 → 2521.00] you
[2521.00 → 2521.82] are
[2521.82 → 2522.12] a
[2522.12 → 2522.40] Peter
[2522.40 → 2523.06] we
[2523.06 → 2523.42] have
[2523.42 → 2524.06] denied
[2524.06 → 2525.14] Jesus
[2525.14 → 2526.64] behold
[2526.64 → 2526.88] the
[2526.88 → 2527.20] lamb
[2527.20 → 2527.66] on the
[2527.66 → 2528.04] cross
[2528.04 → 2528.46] my
[2528.46 → 2528.98] sin
[2528.98 → 2529.70] upon
[2529.70 → 2529.98] his
[2529.98 → 2530.42] shoulders
[2530.42 → 2530.90] ashamed
[2530.90 → 2531.32] I hear
[2531.32 → 2531.78] my
[2531.78 → 2532.26] mocking
[2532.26 → 2532.68] voice
[2532.68 → 2533.38] call out
[2533.38 → 2533.64] among
[2533.64 → 2533.84] the
[2533.84 → 2534.22] scoffers
[2534.22 → 2534.52] it was
[2534.52 → 2534.94] my
[2534.94 → 2535.42] sin
[2535.42 → 2535.92] that
[2535.92 → 2536.18] held
[2536.18 → 2536.34] him
[2536.34 → 2536.54] there
[2536.54 → 2537.14] we
[2537.14 → 2537.64] like
[2537.64 → 2538.18] Peter
[2538.18 → 2538.66] have
[2538.66 → 2539.18] rejected
[2539.18 → 2539.92] Jesus
[2539.92 → 2540.28] and
[2540.28 → 2540.62] are
[2540.62 → 2541.10] hapless
[2541.10 → 2541.60] and
[2541.60 → 2542.10] helpless
[2542.10 → 2542.80] in
[2542.80 → 2543.22] ourselves
[2543.22 → 2543.60] we are
[2543.60 → 2544.04] hapless
[2544.04 → 2544.84] and helpless
[2544.84 → 2545.16] in that
[2545.16 → 2545.38] we've
[2545.38 → 2545.80] denied
[2545.80 → 2546.10] him
[2546.10 → 2546.64] Peter
[2546.64 → 2547.04] denied
[2547.04 → 2547.26] him
[2547.26 → 2547.54] and we
[2547.54 → 2547.88] can do
[2547.88 → 2548.10] no
[2548.10 → 2548.42] other
[2548.42 → 2549.14] we can't
[2549.14 → 2549.48] save
[2549.48 → 2549.92] ourselves
[2549.92 → 2550.28] we are
[2550.28 → 2550.66] hapless
[2550.66 → 2551.52] and helpless
[2551.52 → 2552.48] but
[2552.48 → 2553.76] we are
[2553.76 → 2554.34] not
[2554.34 → 2555.34] hopeless
[2555.34 → 2558.72] then
[2558.72 → 2558.74] then
[2558.74 → 2558.86] the
[2558.86 → 2559.12] Lord
[2559.12 → 2559.66] turned
[2559.66 → 2559.92] and
[2559.92 → 2560.32] looked
[2560.32 → 2560.92] straight
[2560.92 → 2562.10] at
[2562.10 → 2562.40] Peter
[2562.40 → 2563.64] verse
[2563.64 → 2564.08] 61
[2564.08 → 2564.46] of our
[2564.46 → 2564.82] text
[2564.82 → 2565.32] then
[2565.32 → 2565.46] the
[2565.46 → 2565.64] Lord
[2565.64 → 2566.14] turned
[2566.14 → 2566.38] and
[2566.38 → 2566.70] looked
[2566.70 → 2567.50] straight
[2567.50 → 2568.74] at
[2568.74 → 2569.04] Peter
[2569.04 → 2571.18] what
[2571.18 → 2571.28] do
[2571.28 → 2571.30] you
[2571.30 → 2571.44] think
[2571.44 → 2571.58] was
[2571.58 → 2571.72] in
[2571.72 → 2571.94] Jesus
[2571.94 → 2572.40] eyes
[2572.40 → 2573.08] in
[2573.08 → 2573.34] that
[2573.34 → 2573.74] moment
[2573.74 → 2575.50] what
[2575.50 → 2575.64] was
[2575.64 → 2575.76] in
[2575.76 → 2575.92] his
[2575.92 → 2576.48] eyes
[2576.48 → 2576.74] as
[2576.74 → 2576.88] he
[2576.88 → 2577.34] turns
[2577.34 → 2577.86] and
[2577.86 → 2578.24] looks
[2578.24 → 2579.02] at
[2579.02 → 2579.32] Peter
[2579.32 → 2580.82] Peter
[2580.82 → 2580.94] is
[2580.94 → 2581.10] down
[2581.10 → 2581.20] in
[2581.20 → 2581.32] a
[2581.32 → 2581.66] courtyard
[2581.66 → 2582.40] Jesus
[2582.40 → 2582.68] is
[2582.68 → 2583.04] probably
[2583.04 → 2583.38] in
[2583.38 → 2583.60] a
[2583.60 → 2583.86] second
[2583.86 → 2584.44] story
[2584.44 → 2585.00] meeting
[2585.00 → 2585.28] room
[2585.28 → 2585.40] and
[2585.40 → 2585.54] he
[2585.54 → 2586.04] looks
[2586.04 → 2586.36] out
[2586.36 → 2586.52] a
[2586.52 → 2586.76] window
[2586.76 → 2587.16] down
[2587.16 → 2587.34] to
[2587.34 → 2587.50] the
[2587.50 → 2587.86] courtyard
[2587.86 → 2588.30] and
[2588.30 → 2588.40] if
[2588.40 → 2588.48] it
[2588.48 → 2588.60] was
[2588.60 → 2588.78] a
[2588.78 → 2589.12] movie
[2589.12 → 2589.58] the
[2589.58 → 2589.94] music
[2589.94 → 2590.22] would
[2590.22 → 2590.96] stop
[2590.96 → 2591.58] dead
[2591.58 → 2591.78] at
[2591.78 → 2591.94] this
[2591.94 → 2592.22] moment
[2592.22 → 2592.42] and
[2592.42 → 2592.58] the
[2592.58 → 2593.22] silence
[2593.22 → 2593.66] would
[2593.66 → 2593.82] be
[2593.82 → 2594.44] deafening
[2594.44 → 2594.88] as
[2594.88 → 2595.04] the
[2595.04 → 2595.34] camera
[2595.34 → 2595.74] pans
[2595.74 → 2595.98] from
[2595.98 → 2596.26] Jesus
[2596.26 → 2596.62] face
[2596.62 → 2597.02] following
[2597.02 → 2597.30] his
[2597.30 → 2597.54] line
[2597.54 → 2597.68] of
[2597.68 → 2597.92] sight
[2597.92 → 2598.52] directly
[2598.52 → 2598.84] down
[2598.84 → 2599.00] to
[2599.00 → 2599.24] Peter
[2599.24 → 2599.78] Peter
[2599.78 → 2599.98] would
[2599.98 → 2600.20] look
[2600.20 → 2600.42] up
[2600.42 → 2600.60] and
[2600.60 → 2601.06] see
[2601.06 → 2601.40] Jesus
[2601.40 → 2601.68] head
[2601.68 → 2602.08] slowly
[2602.08 → 2602.46] turning
[2602.46 → 2602.62] and
[2602.62 → 2602.74] their
[2602.74 → 2603.06] eyes
[2603.06 → 2603.26] would
[2603.26 → 2603.60] lock
[2603.60 → 2603.96] and
[2603.96 → 2604.06] it
[2604.06 → 2604.18] would

[2766.74 → 2766.96] that
[2766.96 → 2767.14] we
[2767.14 → 2767.28] could
[2767.28 → 2767.50] still
[2767.50 → 2767.74] see
[2767.74 → 2767.94] you

[2772.54 → 2772.62] you
[2772.62 → 2772.68] would

[2773.52 → 2773.74] minute
[2773.74 → 2774.14] or
[2774.14 → 2774.44] two
[2774.44 → 2774.70] or
[2774.70 → 2775.18] five
[2775.18 → 2775.56] depending
[2775.56 → 2775.86] on
[2775.86 → 2776.36] however
[2776.36 → 2776.62] long
[2776.62 → 2776.72] it
[2776.72 → 2776.86] took
[2776.86 → 2777.00] for
[2777.00 → 2777.12] you
[2777.12 → 2777.32] to
[2777.32 → 2777.74] get
[2777.74 → 2777.82] what
[2777.82 → 2777.90] we
[2777.90 → 2778.00] were
[2778.00 → 2778.24] talking
[2778.24 → 2778.48] about
[2778.48 → 2779.84] and
[2779.84 → 2779.98] then
[2779.98 → 2780.44] after
[2780.44 → 2780.90] you
[2780.90 → 2781.04] had
[2781.04 → 2781.26] sat
[2781.26 → 2781.44] there
[2781.44 → 2781.60] for

[2782.00 → 2782.30] out
[2782.30 → 2783.04] Rachel
[2783.04 → 2783.62] or
[2783.62 → 2783.96] I
[2783.96 → 2784.42] would
[2784.42 → 2784.72] go
[2784.72 → 2785.08] over
[2785.08 → 2785.34] and
[2785.34 → 2785.62] talk
[2785.62 → 2785.76] to
[2785.76 → 2785.90] them
[2785.90 → 2786.10] about
[2786.10 → 2786.42] why
[2786.42 → 2786.62] they're
[2786.62 → 2786.84] in
[2786.84 → 2787.12] time
[2787.12 → 2787.42] out
[2787.42 → 2788.34] and
[2788.34 → 2788.46] then
[2788.46 → 2788.58] they
[2788.58 → 2788.68] would
[2788.68 → 2788.78] have
[2788.78 → 2788.90] to
[2788.90 → 2789.04] say
[2789.04 → 2789.48] sorry
[2789.48 → 2790.10] and
[2790.10 → 2790.24] we
[2790.24 → 2790.42] would
[2790.42 → 2790.84] remind
[2790.84 → 2791.20] them
[2791.20 → 2791.48] that
[2791.48 → 2792.26] sorry
[2792.26 → 2793.00] means
[2793.00 → 2793.42] changing
[2793.42 → 2793.62] your
[2793.62 → 2794.08] behaviour
[2794.08 → 2794.96] and
[2794.96 → 2795.18] then
[2795.18 → 2795.36] we
[2795.36 → 2795.48] would
[2795.48 → 2795.68] say
[2795.68 → 2795.80] I
[2795.80 → 2796.02] love
[2796.02 → 2796.32] you
[2796.32 → 2797.34] and
[2797.34 → 2797.46] I
[2797.46 → 2797.68] forgive
[2797.68 → 2798.02] you
[2798.02 → 2800.16] well
[2800.16 → 2801.20] one
[2801.20 → 2801.60] time
[2801.60 → 2802.54] that
[2802.54 → 2802.88] beautiful
[2802.88 → 2803.24] picture
[2803.24 → 2803.42] of
[2803.42 → 2803.74] parenting
[2803.74 → 2804.00] just
[2804.00 → 2804.26] wasn't
[2804.26 → 2804.62] working
[2804.62 → 2806.76] and
[2806.76 → 2807.08] so
[2807.08 → 2807.82] as
[2807.82 → 2808.34] part
[2808.34 → 2808.52] of
[2808.52 → 2808.70] the
[2808.70 → 2809.24] talking
[2809.24 → 2810.36] afterwards
[2810.36 → 2810.92] time
[2810.92 → 2811.20] I
[2811.20 → 2811.50] thought
[2811.50 → 2811.66] I
[2811.66 → 2811.80] would
[2811.80 → 2812.14] ask
[2812.14 → 2812.38] my
[2812.38 → 2812.74] daughter
[2812.74 → 2813.52] Nora
[2813.52 → 2813.84] and
[2813.84 → 2813.96] I
[2813.96 → 2814.10] would
[2814.10 → 2814.40] say
[2814.40 → 2815.32] and
[2815.32 → 2815.44] I
[2815.44 → 2815.68] asked
[2815.68 → 2815.84] her
[2815.84 → 2816.32] why
[2816.32 → 2816.52] do
[2816.52 → 2816.66] you
[2816.66 → 2816.86] think
[2816.86 → 2817.04] we
[2817.04 → 2817.26] have
[2817.26 → 2817.74] rules
[2817.74 → 2818.30] for
[2818.30 → 2818.46] you
[2818.46 → 2818.62] to
[2818.62 → 2818.92] obey
[2818.92 → 2820.16] she
[2820.16 → 2820.38] didn't
[2820.38 → 2820.60] really
[2820.60 → 2820.84] know
[2820.84 → 2821.06] she
[2821.06 → 2821.28] was
[2821.28 → 2821.82] five
[2821.82 → 2821.96] or
[2821.96 → 2822.18] six
[2822.18 → 2822.34] years
[2822.34 → 2822.54] old
[2822.54 → 2822.66] at
[2822.66 → 2823.00] time
[2823.00 → 2824.44] but
[2824.44 → 2825.00] I
[2825.00 → 2825.32] told
[2825.32 → 2825.60] her
[2825.60 → 2825.86] that
[2825.86 → 2826.36] we
[2826.36 → 2826.70] have
[2826.70 → 2827.28] rules
[2827.28 → 2827.72] because
[2827.72 → 2827.98] we
[2827.98 → 2828.28] want
[2828.28 → 2828.64] you
[2828.64 → 2828.88] to
[2828.88 → 2829.08] be
[2829.08 → 2829.50] happy
[2829.50 → 2829.80] and
[2829.80 → 2830.28] safe
[2830.28 → 2831.34] I
[2831.34 → 2831.70] told
[2831.70 → 2831.98] her
[2831.98 → 2832.22] that
[2832.22 → 2833.04] obedience
[2833.04 → 2833.62] was
[2833.62 → 2833.88] for
[2833.88 → 2834.10] her
[2834.10 → 2834.62] joy
[2834.62 → 2835.06] that
[2835.06 → 2835.40] life
[2835.40 → 2835.60] would
[2835.60 → 2835.76] be
[2835.76 → 2836.08] better
[2836.08 → 2836.30] if
[2836.30 → 2836.46] she
[2836.46 → 2836.74] lived
[2836.74 → 2836.92] the
[2836.92 → 2837.14] way
[2837.14 → 2837.32] that
[2837.32 → 2837.46] we
[2837.46 → 2837.62] have
[2837.62 → 2837.96] set
[2837.96 → 2838.26] out
[2838.26 → 2838.68] to
[2838.68 → 2838.92] live
[2838.92 → 2839.20] not
[2839.20 → 2839.56] because
[2839.56 → 2839.80] then
[2839.80 → 2840.02] she
[2840.02 → 2840.30] wouldn't
[2840.30 → 2840.48] be
[2840.48 → 2841.06] punished
[2841.06 → 2841.48] but
[2841.48 → 2841.82] because
[2841.82 → 2842.02] in
[2842.02 → 2842.62] obedience
[2842.62 → 2842.90] is
[2842.90 → 2843.18] true
[2843.18 → 2843.70] freedom
[2843.70 → 2844.08] right
[2844.08 → 2844.98] obeying
[2844.98 → 2845.46] brings
[2845.46 → 2845.66] an
[2845.66 → 2846.34] experience
[2846.34 → 2846.62] of
[2846.62 → 2847.04] joy
[2847.04 → 2848.70] now
[2848.70 → 2849.68] she
[2849.68 → 2849.88] didn't
[2849.88 → 2850.10] get
[2850.10 → 2850.36] all
[2850.36 → 2850.50] of
[2850.50 → 2850.76] that
[2850.76 → 2850.98] of
[2850.98 → 2851.28] course
[2851.28 → 2851.44] and
[2851.44 → 2851.56] it's
[2851.56 → 2851.72] not
[2851.72 → 2851.86] that
[2851.86 → 2852.08] she's
[2852.08 → 2852.26] now
[2852.26 → 2852.88] perfectly
[2852.88 → 2853.48] obedient
[2853.48 → 2853.86] and
[2853.86 → 2854.46] sanctified
[2854.46 → 2854.68] of
[2854.68 → 2854.90] course
[2854.90 → 2855.22] not
[2855.22 → 2855.82] but
[2855.82 → 2856.00] we
[2856.00 → 2856.28] did
[2856.28 → 2856.74] begin
[2856.74 → 2857.04] to
[2857.04 → 2858.08] reframe
[2858.08 → 2858.88] obedience
[2858.88 → 2859.08] a
[2859.08 → 2859.24] little
[2859.24 → 2859.56] bit
[2859.56 → 2860.22] right
[2860.22 → 2860.38] we
[2860.38 → 2860.62] did
[2860.62 → 2861.10] begin
[2861.10 → 2861.36] to
[2861.36 → 2861.92] connect
[2861.92 → 2862.74] obedience
[2862.74 → 2863.26] to
[2863.26 → 2863.82] her
[2863.82 → 2864.24] joy
[2864.24 → 2865.98] but
[2865.98 → 2866.18] even
[2866.18 → 2866.54] more
[2866.54 → 2866.76] than
[2866.76 → 2867.16] that
[2867.16 → 2868.36] as
[2868.36 → 2868.56] her
[2868.56 → 2869.28] parents
[2869.28 → 2870.04] we
[2870.04 → 2870.44] are
[2870.44 → 2870.90] setting
[2870.90 → 2871.18] the
[2871.18 → 2871.72] context
[2871.72 → 2871.92] for
[2871.92 → 2872.08] how
[2872.08 → 2872.36] she
[2872.36 → 2872.62] will
[2872.62 → 2873.28] experience
[2873.28 → 2873.90] God
[2873.90 → 2874.38] in
[2874.38 → 2874.62] her
[2874.62 → 2875.06] life
[2875.06 → 2875.46] and
[2875.46 → 2875.62] how
[2875.62 → 2875.82] she
[2875.82 → 2876.02] will
[2876.02 → 2876.54] experience
[2876.54 → 2876.82] his
[2876.82 → 2877.28] call
[2877.28 → 2877.74] to
[2877.74 → 2878.22] holiness
[2878.22 → 2878.58] in
[2878.58 → 2878.80] her
[2878.80 → 2879.22] life
[2879.22 → 2880.82] and
[2880.82 → 2881.10] so
[2881.10 → 2881.48] because
[2881.48 → 2881.96] we
[2881.96 → 2882.18] are
[2882.18 → 2882.72] setting
[2882.72 → 2882.94] the
[2882.94 → 2883.38] context
[2883.38 → 2883.56] for
[2883.56 → 2883.72] her
[2883.72 → 2884.26] experience
[2884.26 → 2884.46] of
[2884.46 → 2884.72] God
[2884.72 → 2884.94] it's
[2884.94 → 2885.12] not
[2885.12 → 2885.42] just
[2885.42 → 2886.08] about
[2886.08 → 2887.38] what
[2887.38 → 2887.62] we
[2887.62 → 2888.02] say
[2888.02 → 2888.24] but
[2888.24 → 2888.56] also
[2888.56 → 2888.94] how
[2888.94 → 2889.18] we
[2889.18 → 2889.46] say
[2889.46 → 2889.68] it
[2889.68 → 2891.12] and
[2891.12 → 2891.28] as
[2891.28 → 2891.48] Nora
[2891.48 → 2891.70] and I
[2891.70 → 2892.12] talked
[2892.12 → 2892.44] in that
[2892.44 → 2892.68] moment
[2892.68 → 2892.86] I
[2892.86 → 2893.08] made
[2893.08 → 2893.38] sure
[2893.38 → 2893.62] to
[2893.62 → 2894.36] get
[2894.36 → 2894.94] down
[2894.94 → 2895.38] right
[2895.38 → 2895.60] in
[2895.60 → 2895.78] front
[2895.78 → 2895.90] of
[2895.90 → 2896.04] her
[2896.04 → 2896.34] on
[2896.34 → 2896.96] my
[2896.96 → 2897.28] knees
[2897.28 → 2897.48] to
[2897.48 → 2897.72] look
[2897.72 → 2897.86] her
[2897.86 → 2898.00] in
[2898.00 → 2898.14] the
[2898.14 → 2898.50] eyes
[2898.50 → 2898.68] and
[2898.68 → 2898.82] to
[2898.82 → 2899.12] pour
[2899.12 → 2899.38] as
[2899.38 → 2899.60] much
[2899.60 → 2900.14] love
[2900.14 → 2900.44] and
[2900.44 → 2900.88] joy
[2900.88 → 2901.34] and
[2901.34 → 2901.76] hope
[2901.76 → 2902.10] into
[2902.10 → 2902.36] my
[2902.36 → 2902.58] own
[2902.58 → 2902.92] eyes
[2902.92 → 2903.42] even
[2903.42 → 2903.64] through
[2903.64 → 2903.82] my
[2903.82 → 2903.98] own
[2903.98 → 2904.26] tears
[2904.26 → 2904.40] in
[2904.40 → 2904.52] that
[2904.52 → 2904.70] moment
[2904.70 → 2904.96] as
[2904.96 → 2905.08] I
[2905.08 → 2905.28] could
[2905.28 → 2905.68] so
[2905.68 → 2905.84] that
[2905.84 → 2906.12] even
[2906.12 → 2906.46] as
[2906.46 → 2906.60] I
[2906.60 → 2906.72] am
[2906.72 → 2906.98] teaching
[2906.98 → 2907.16] her
[2907.16 → 2907.52] even
[2907.52 → 2907.84] as
[2907.84 → 2908.00] she
[2908.00 → 2908.20] is
[2908.20 → 2908.76] denying
[2908.76 → 2909.30] me
[2909.30 → 2909.78] by
[2909.78 → 2910.00] her
[2910.00 → 2910.60] lifestyle
[2910.60 → 2911.16] the
[2911.16 → 2911.48] love
[2911.48 → 2911.66] that
[2911.66 → 2911.84] I
[2911.84 → 2912.16] have
[2912.16 → 2912.38] for
[2912.38 → 2912.66] her
[2912.66 → 2912.88] as

[2913.92 → 2914.30] out

[3783.98 → 3813.96] Thank you.
[3813.98 → 3821.36] The Father turns His face away
[3821.36 → 3827.90] As moons which are the chosen one
[3827.90 → 3833.30] With many sons to glory
[3833.30 → 3851.42] Behold the man upon a cross
[3851.42 → 3857.30] I see upon His shoulders

[3965.88 → 3972.66] I cannot give an answer
[3972.66 → 3980.96] But this I know with all my heart
[3980.96 → 3987.46] These wounds have made my last song
[3995.88 → 4008.62] It was now about noon.
[4009.76 → 4014.30] Darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.
[4015.58 → 4017.94] The sun stopped shining.
[4018.82 → 4021.14] And the curtain in the temple was torn in two.
[4021.54 → 4023.44] And Jesus called out in a loud voice,
[4023.44 → 4027.32] Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.
[4028.44 → 4032.32] And when he had said this, he breathed his last.
