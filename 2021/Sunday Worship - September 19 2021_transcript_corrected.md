[0.00 → 6.14] I'll sing, if you say release, I'm letting go.
[6.78 → 10.08] If you're in here with me, I'll be here.
[10.68 → 14.24] And when you say to jump, I'm diving in.
[14.84 → 18.52] If you say you're still, then I will wait.
[19.08 → 22.36] If you say to trust, I will obey.
[23.06 → 26.48] I don't want to follow my own way.
[26.48 → 29.42] I'm done chasing feelings.
[30.24 → 31.54] Spirit.
[37.58 → 39.00] Spirit.
[46.86 → 49.62] It felt like a burden.
[51.54 → 53.34] The л matte I can grasp.
[55.32 → 57.38] Read the focus.
[57.38 → 61.66] I'm going to go further, further than I was asking.
[63.78 → 70.44] Simply to see you, the door of God.
[71.94 → 78.04] My life is an altar, let your fire fall.
[80.52 → 84.00] If you say it's wrong, then I'll say no.
[84.00 → 88.26] If you say release, I'm letting go.
[88.84 → 92.16] If you're in it with me, I'll be there.
[92.70 → 96.30] And when you say to jump, I'm diving in.
[96.96 → 100.54] If you say be still, then I will wait.
[100.98 → 104.58] If you say to trust, I will obey.
[105.14 → 108.60] Teach me how to follow in your way.
[108.60 → 111.42] I'm done chasing feelings.
[111.42 → 116.26] Spirit, be me.
[116.26 → 123.26] Spirit, be me.
[123.26 → 132.42] Spirit, be me.
[132.42 → 141.26] Spirit, be me.
[141.26 → 151.68] I know hope needs more.
[151.68 → 155.94] And your word is all I've got.
[157.02 → 159.96] I have to believe.
[160.96 → 164.12] You still bring water from the rock.
[165.40 → 168.12] To satisfy my heart.
[169.40 → 172.10] To love me as my girl.
[172.10 → 176.22] Even when I don't remember.
[176.94 → 180.62] You remind me of my worth.
[181.88 → 184.94] I don't trust my ways.
[185.94 → 189.06] I'm trading in my thoughts.
[190.06 → 192.66] I lay down everything.
[192.66 → 196.62] らい by car.
[198.64 → 205.00] We're taking.
[205.00 → 205.50] You still bring what I want.
[205.50 → 214.00] And even when it don't make sense, I'm going to let the Spirit lead.
[217.50 → 222.00] I'm going to let the Spirit lead.
[225.60 → 230.00] I'm going to let the Spirit lead.
[230.00 → 238.00] I'm going to love the Spirit lead.
[239.00 → 241.00] The Spirit lead.
[242.00 → 242.50] Essex EMA!
[243.00 → 246.28] I'm going to let the Spirit lead.
[246.78 → 254.28] I'm going to let the Spirit lead.

[343.92 → 350.56] Sing louder, and this praise he roars with praise.
[350.56 → 353.44] Can you hear it?
[353.96 → 358.38] The sound of heaven touching us.
[359.96 → 364.34] The sound of heaven touching us.
[364.34 → 371.22] King Jesus, you're the name we're lifting high.

[531.44 → 533.48] Jesus, you're the name we're seated.
[533.48 → 537.70] Lord, can you do the wrong life,
[537.82 → 538.98] hear Jesus?
[538.98 → 541.10] Lord is here, if you are heaven.
[541.10 → 543.66] Nothing that matters, Lord.
[543.90 → 546.78] Nothing that matters, Lord.
[547.14 → 550.30] Be glorified, God.
[556.66 → 559.74] Spirit, break up.

[655.50 → 657.88] the one you've done
[657.88 → 661.32] the power of your blood
[661.32 → 663.68] it's more than enough
[663.68 → 665.18] you've done
[665.18 → 669.04] the sacrifice
[669.04 → 671.38] changed history
[671.38 → 674.26] the nails in your hands
[674.26 → 676.36] the hands that saved me
[676.36 → 678.34] the grave was
[678.34 → 681.14] the death lost its sting
[681.14 → 685.38] With the Lion Lord in victory
[685.38 → 690.10] The sacrifice that changed history
[690.10 → 695.14] The nails in your hands, the hands that saved me
[695.14 → 700.08] And that grave was sealed, where death lost its name
[700.08 → 704.36] With the Lion Lord in victory

[758.86 → 762.26] Come on, let's let this roar tonight
[762.26 → 766.52] Thank you
[766.52 → 771.02] For breaking the bread of your body

[867.88 → 869.88] More than enough
[869.88 → 870.88] All the cross
[870.88 → 872.88] What you've done

[972.88 → 976.88] you never stop loving us
[976.88 → 980.88] no matter how far we run
[980.88 → 984.88] you never gave up on us
[984.88 → 988.88] all heaven should let the future begin
[988.88 → 990.88] you
[990.88 → 994.88] you
[994.88 → 996.88] you
[996.88 → 998.88] you
[998.88 → 1000.88] you
[1000.88 → 1002.88] you
[1002.88 → 1006.88] you

[1043.88 → 1066.64] I feel alive, I come alive, I am alive, I am alive, I'm God's great dance floor
[1066.64 → 1083.38] I feel alive, I come alive, I am alive, I'm God's great dance floor
[1083.38 → 1096.56] I feel alive, come alive, and am alive, and guys break this road
[1096.56 → 1104.16] I feel alive, and come alive, and am alive, and guys break this road
[1104.16 → 1111.90] And guys break this road
[1113.38 → 1138.26] We had a BC-wide youth conference called Reactivate
[1138.26 → 1140.10] That was just a little bit of a recap
[1140.10 → 1145.84] And I can promise you, contrary to what seeing Adrian asleep on the couch might have looked like
[1145.84 → 1149.12] It was a lot of fun for everyone who was there
[1149.12 → 1153.88] If you find a youth later on today, you can ask them how it was
[1153.88 → 1156.52] You can get Pastor Kevin to give you a fuller report
[1156.52 → 1158.76] It was an excellent weekend had by all
[1158.76 → 1161.62] And so we were just so privileged to be part of that
[1161.62 → 1162.78] And to share in that experience
[1162.78 → 1165.12] And we wanted to share that with you this morning
[1165.12 → 1169.14] For those of you who are visiting with us, or if this is your first time here
[1169.14 → 1171.00] Or checking us out online, my name is Chris
[1171.00 → 1172.78] I'm one of the pastors here
[1172.78 → 1176.28] It's my privilege to lead in worship with you this morning
[1176.28 → 1178.12] And with this team here on stage
[1178.12 → 1181.06] Before we do that, I have just a few announcements
[1181.06 → 1185.06] You probably saw on your way in or walked through the fog
[1185.06 → 1186.36] In order to get into here
[1186.36 → 1188.56] But today is the ministry fair
[1188.56 → 1190.62] And so following our service
[1190.62 → 1194.24] We have the different ministries and missions of our church
[1194.24 → 1196.74] Out there to tell you the story
[1196.74 → 1198.96] Of how God is at work in our community
[1198.96 → 1202.76] And to our community through them
[1202.76 → 1205.80] And so engage with different groups and tables
[1205.80 → 1209.58] Some of them even have ways to earn your affection
[1209.58 → 1213.86] And so you can get one of these at certain tables and the like
[1213.86 → 1215.56] And they will share stories with you
[1215.56 → 1218.00] I'm keeping this one right here
[1218.00 → 1221.30] And so please, stick around after the service
[1221.30 → 1222.56] And do that together
[1222.56 → 1225.14] We do want to say next week
[1225.14 → 1227.42] We are also, Lord willing
[1227.42 → 1229.10] Because we're hoping that the break in the rain
[1229.10 → 1230.86] That is currently forecasted will be the case
[1230.86 → 1232.40] Doing our community festival
[1232.40 → 1234.64] From 1pm to 4pm
[1234.64 → 1237.04] And so that's going to happen next week
[1237.04 → 1238.24] After service, outdoors
[1238.24 → 1239.60] In the backspace there
[1239.60 → 1241.52] So please come for that
[1241.52 → 1244.08] Invite friends, family, neighbours, co-workers
[1244.08 → 1245.10] Whatever the like
[1245.10 → 1246.36] And join us
[1246.36 → 1249.00] There is a couple needs yet for that
[1249.00 → 1250.66] And these are really awesome needs
[1250.66 → 1252.12] And so if you can help
[1252.12 → 1255.50] By being the sort of point person supervisor
[1255.50 → 1258.22] At either the giant slide in bouncy castle
[1258.22 → 1259.62] Or the obstacle course
[1259.62 → 1261.26] Or the jousting station
[1261.26 → 1262.60] We need you
[1262.60 → 1265.70] Jousting is a lot of fun apparently
[1265.70 → 1267.18] If you don't mind getting hit in the head
[1267.18 → 1269.72] But please talk to Pastor Kevin
[1269.72 → 1270.40] After that
[1270.40 → 1272.84] And he will help get that organized
[1272.84 → 1274.70] Also
[1274.70 → 1280.00] We have recently restarted our choir here
[1280.00 → 1282.88] And they are working on a Christmas concert
[1282.88 → 1286.52] But they are in need of some more sopranos and tenors
[1286.52 → 1289.14] And so if you've been looking for a place to sing
[1289.14 → 1290.84] Or trying to figure out
[1290.84 → 1292.78] If maybe that's something you might be interested in
[1292.78 → 1294.76] Please talk to myself
[1294.76 → 1296.06] Or I can connect you with Mark
[1296.06 → 1297.44] Who's leading the choir
[1297.44 → 1299.88] As we work towards a Christmas concert
[1299.88 → 1301.12] And so think about that
[1301.12 → 1302.84] Maybe you can be part of that
[1302.84 → 1304.68] They usually meet on Monday nights
[1304.68 → 1306.42] Here to practice
[1306.42 → 1308.64] Also
[1308.64 → 1311.20] Later today
[1311.20 → 1312.26] At two o'clock
[1312.26 → 1313.52] There is a grade eight
[1313.52 → 1315.38] Youth and parents
[1315.38 → 1316.80] Meet and greet
[1316.80 → 1318.18] Social event with Pastor Kevin
[1318.18 → 1319.36] That's happening here at church
[1319.36 → 1321.02] So you were emailed that a week ago
[1321.02 → 1322.12] This is your reminder
[1322.12 → 1324.64] And then on Tuesday
[1324.64 → 1325.88] There is council
[1325.88 → 1327.92] And so we're going to have a meeting
[1327.92 → 1329.58] As council
[1329.58 → 1330.16] As the board
[1330.16 → 1331.68] We wanted to put that in front of you
[1331.68 → 1332.32] You can remember that
[1332.32 → 1333.40] In your prayers
[1333.40 → 1334.70] Finally
[1334.70 → 1337.16] I just want to take a moment
[1337.16 → 1338.18] And remind you
[1338.18 → 1339.82] That during our worship
[1339.82 → 1341.24] We are asking you to
[1341.24 → 1342.70] Wear your masks
[1342.70 → 1344.02] Especially while we are singing
[1344.02 → 1345.78] This past week
[1345.78 → 1347.36] Some of you may have heard
[1347.36 → 1348.06] But there was
[1348.06 → 1349.34] A few cases
[1349.34 → 1350.52] At a church community
[1350.52 → 1352.30] That we are really close with
[1352.30 → 1352.96] That a number of us
[1352.96 → 1353.98] Have contacts with
[1353.98 → 1356.28] And so we want to
[1356.28 → 1357.64] Make sure that we remain
[1357.64 → 1358.54] Intentional
[1358.54 → 1360.58] In our response
[1360.58 → 1361.58] And in the reality

[2434.84 → 2452.16] The epicentre of the earthquake was located in Niki's department near the city of Lead 150 kilometres southwest of Port-au-Prince for many Haitians this earthquake was reminiscent of the deadly earthquake that struck Haiti in 2010 which killed anywhere between 250,000 to 300,000 people.
[2452.16 → 2467.48] As for this year's earthquake recent numbers indicated at least 2200 people are dead and at least 12,200 people are injured and an unknown number of people are still missing.
[2467.48 → 2474.48] In the south department of Haiti where La Quay is situated more than 50,000 homes have been completely destroyed and 77,000 damaged.
[2474.48 → 2481.48] Thousands of people are left homeless and many are left homeless and many are living out in the open without any protection.
[2481.48 → 2489.48] The count of those dead in the area is in the area of the city of Lead 150,000 people are still missing.
[2489.48 → 2495.48] Thousands of people are left homeless and many are living out in the open without any protection.
[2495.48 → 2508.48] The count of those dead injured and displaced is expected to continue to climb.
[2508.48 → 2521.48] Further complications, relief and rescue efforts, tropical depression grace drenched the earthquake area with up to 10 inches of rainfall.
[2521.48 → 2538.48] World Renewal has been in Haiti since 1976, and they welcome donations to assist affected Haitians by building temporary shelter and providing kits that contain household and personal care items.
[2538.48 → 2546.48] Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have for such sacrifices are pleasing to God.
[2546.48 → 2549.48] Hebrews 13 verse 16.
[2549.48 → 2553.48] Next week offerings are budget and safe church ministry.

[2662.64 → 2670.18] Seven and stars in their forces are loved.
[2671.04 → 2677.76] Joined with all nature in plentiful goodness.
[2677.76 → 2685.40] To thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.
[2686.66 → 2693.94] Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[2693.94 → 2701.36] Morning by morning new mercies I see.
[2701.36 → 2709.08] All I have needed, thy hand hath provided.
[2709.08 → 2716.58] Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
[2716.58 → 2727.64] Lord, and for sin and a peace that am current.
[2727.64 → 2735.86] Thy own dear presence to cheer unto thine.
[2736.66 → 2743.46] Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow.
[2743.46 → 2751.36] Blessings all mine, blessings all mine with ten thousand beside.
[2751.36 → 2760.10] Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[2760.10 → 2767.36] Morning by morning new mercies I see.
[2767.36 → 2775.26] All I have needed, thy hand hath provided.
[2775.26 → 2784.94] Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
[2784.94 → 2795.16] Good morning everyone.
[2795.16 → 2795.56] Whoa.
[2795.56 → 2798.74] If I could have all the kids up front here.
[2799.30 → 2799.84] What are we doing?
[2800.12 → 2802.36] Little kids up to grade four.
[2803.12 → 2805.64] Unless some of you older kids want to come up, we'd be happy to have you.
[2806.92 → 2807.74] Come on up.
[2807.74 → 2807.76] Come on up.
[2807.76 → 2807.80] Come on up.
[2807.80 → 2809.80] Come on up.
[2809.80 → 2811.80] Come on up.
[2811.80 → 2814.92] Come on up.
[2814.94 → 2816.84] How's everybody doing this morning?
[2816.84 → 2816.94] Good?
[2816.94 → 2817.94] Good?
[2817.94 → 2818.94] Good?
[2818.94 → 2822.94] You guys all liked my special shirt last time I was up here so I decided to wear it again
[2822.94 → 2823.94] this morning.
[2823.94 → 2824.94] So it's my summer shirt.
[2824.94 → 2825.94] You like it?
[2825.94 → 2826.94] All right.
[2826.94 → 2827.94] Right on.
[2827.94 → 2831.94] You're in grade three?
[2831.94 → 2832.94] That's awesome.
[2832.94 → 2834.94] School started, eh?
[2834.94 → 2835.94] Good.
[2835.94 → 2843.94] So I want to do something kind of fun with you guys this morning before we go to children's worship time.
[2843.94 → 2846.94] You guys see this fancy new stage we got up front here?
[2846.94 → 2847.94] Yeah.
[2847.94 → 2849.94] Kind of cool looking, eh?
[2849.94 → 2852.94] When I was sitting in church last Sunday, I was looking at that stage, and I'm thinking,
[2852.94 → 2853.94] you know what?
[2853.94 → 2854.94] If I was a kid, you know what I'd want to do?
[2854.94 → 2856.94] I want to jump off that thing.
[2856.94 → 2857.94] What do you think?
[2857.94 → 2859.94] Would you want to jump off that thing?
[2859.94 → 2860.94] Yeah.
[2860.94 → 2861.94] Is it too high?
[2861.94 → 2862.94] No.
[2862.94 → 2869.94] So this summer we, I was out with some friends, and we were at some beach, and we were jumping
[2869.94 → 2872.94] off stuff, old people.
[2872.94 → 2873.94] And we took some pictures.
[2873.94 → 2876.94] So I'm just wondering if you guys have ever done one of these pictures in the past.
[2876.94 → 2878.94] William's going to put it up on the screen.
[2878.94 → 2879.94] So this is kind of the picture.
[2879.94 → 2880.94] You see that picture right there?
[2880.94 → 2884.94] Has anybody ever done one of those still photo pictures off a log or off something like
[2884.94 → 2885.94] that?
[2885.94 → 2886.94] Jumping in the air?
[2886.94 → 2887.94] What do you think?
[2887.94 → 2890.94] Should we do that off the stage here this morning?
[2890.94 → 2891.94] Who's up for that?
[2891.94 → 2892.94] Yeah?
[2892.94 → 2893.94] We're doing it?
[2893.94 → 2894.94] Let's do it.
[2894.94 → 2895.94] Okay.
[2895.94 → 2897.94] I think we got too many kids here so we're going to do it in two groups.
[2897.94 → 2898.94] Okay?
[2898.94 → 2900.94] I need, let's get a bunch of kids up on the stage there.
[2900.94 → 2905.94] Up on the front here, right up here.
[2905.94 → 2906.94] Right up here like this.
[2906.94 → 2907.94] We're going to do it in two groups.
[2907.94 → 2910.94] So half you guys can go up there first, and I'm going to take a video, or maybe I can get
[2910.94 → 2912.94] Jared here to take a video for me.
[2912.94 → 2915.94] Jared's my fancy assistant here.
[2915.94 → 2916.94] Okay.
[2916.94 → 2921.94] Let's line everybody up on the front here.
[2921.94 → 2922.94] Can you move all the way over?
[2922.94 → 2924.94] All the way over, over, over, over.
[2924.94 → 2926.94] Good, good, good, good.
[2926.94 → 2927.94] Okay.
[2927.94 → 2928.94] You guys have to wait.
[2928.94 → 2929.94] You can come up front here.
[2929.94 → 2931.94] Haley, you can come up front.
[2931.94 → 2932.94] All right.
[2932.94 → 2937.94] You guys got to listen to me real close because I'm on the count of three you're going to jump.
[2937.94 → 2939.94] So I say one, two, three, then you're all going to jump.
[2939.94 → 2942.94] Did you see that picture up there where guys were doing funny stuff in the air?
[2942.94 → 2943.94] Can you do that?
[2943.94 → 2946.94] Or you're just going to jump?
[2946.94 → 2948.94] Who's the craziest one up here?
[2948.94 → 2949.94] Cole?
[2949.94 → 2950.94] All right.
[2950.94 → 2951.94] All right.
[2951.94 → 2952.94] On the count of three.
[2952.94 → 2954.94] So at three you're going to jump.
[2954.94 → 2955.94] Ready?
[2955.94 → 2957.94] One, two, three, go.
[2957.94 → 2958.94] Okay.
[2958.94 → 2959.94] You guys got to do that again.
[2959.94 → 2960.94] Get back up there.
[2960.94 → 2961.94] Go back up there.
[2961.94 → 2962.94] Come on.
[2962.94 → 2963.94] Go back up there.
[2963.94 → 2964.94] Go back up there.
[2964.94 → 2965.94] Go back up there.
[2965.94 → 2966.94] It's got to be something like this.
[2966.94 → 2967.94] I got to do it for you guys.
[2967.94 → 2968.94] Got to go like this.
[2968.94 → 2971.94] Can you do that?
[2971.94 → 2972.94] Can you do that?
[2972.94 → 2973.94] All right.
[2973.94 → 2975.94] On the count of three.
[2975.94 → 2977.94] One, two, three, go.
[2977.94 → 2978.94] Not bad.
[2978.94 → 2979.94] Not bad.
[2979.94 → 2980.94] Okay.
[2980.94 → 2981.94] Next group up.
[2981.94 → 2982.94] You guys can move over to the side there.
[2982.94 → 2983.94] Next group.
[2983.94 → 2984.94] All right.
[2984.94 → 2985.94] That's good.
[2985.94 → 2986.94] We'll do this in three.
[2986.94 → 2987.94] Okay.
[2987.94 → 2988.94] You low bird kids.
[2988.94 → 2989.94] Come on.
[2989.94 → 2990.94] Give me something here.
[2990.94 → 2991.94] Okay.
[2991.94 → 2992.94] Something crazy.
[2992.94 → 2993.94] On the count of three.
[2993.94 → 2996.94] One, two, three.
[2996.94 → 2998.94] I'm not a great coordinator here.
[2998.94 → 2999.94] I can see.
[2999.94 → 3000.94] Okay.
[3000.94 → 3001.94] Everybody else move over.
[3001.94 → 3002.94] Next group.
[3002.94 → 3003.94] Last group.
[3003.94 → 3004.94] Okay.
[3004.94 → 3005.94] Zoe?
[3005.94 → 3006.94] Okay.
[3006.94 → 3007.94] Zoe?
[3007.94 → 3008.94] Okay.
[3008.94 → 3009.94] Okay.
[3009.94 → 3010.94] Okay.
[3010.94 → 3011.94] Okay.
[3011.94 → 3014.94] Zoe, you're coming over?
[3014.94 → 3015.94] Come on.
[3015.94 → 3016.94] You don't want to?
[3016.94 → 3017.94] Okay.
[3017.94 → 3020.94] You guys are the last ones.
[3020.94 → 3022.94] Olivia, something crazy in the air.
[3022.94 → 3023.94] You doing it?
[3023.94 → 3024.94] All right.
[3024.94 → 3025.94] On the count of three.
[3025.94 → 3028.94] One, two, three, go.
[3028.94 → 3029.94] Yes.
[3029.94 → 3030.94] All right.
[3030.94 → 3031.94] Okay.
[3031.94 → 3034.94] Let's, everybody come.
[3034.94 → 3036.94] We're going to do the blessing now, and then we're going to head off to Children's
[3036.94 → 3037.94] Worship Time.
[3037.94 → 3038.94] Thanks for helping me with that.
[3038.94 → 3039.94] That was awesome.
[3039.94 → 3040.94] So let's face the congregation.
[3040.94 → 3044.94] If everybody could stand up please for us.
[3044.94 → 3047.94] You guys all know how to do this?
[3047.94 → 3053.94] Remember Pastor Chris taught us last week you have to like to do this kind of action.
[3053.94 → 3054.94] Remember?
[3054.94 → 3055.94] All right.
[3055.94 → 3056.94] Ready?
[3056.94 → 3057.94] The Lord be with you.
[3057.94 → 3060.94] All right.
[3060.94 → 3062.94] Let's go to Children's Worship Time.
[3062.94 → 3064.36] Thank you.
[3070.94 → 3071.94] Good morning everybody.
[3071.94 → 3072.94] My name's Ken.
[3072.94 → 3073.94] I'm an elder here.
[3073.94 → 3083.94] I have terrible name tag management, so I don't have it.
[3083.94 → 3084.94] And I would like to lead you in congregational prayer.
[3084.94 → 3085.94] So please pray with me.
[3085.94 → 3098.94] Our Father in heaven, holy is your great name.
[3098.94 → 3099.94] You are worthy of all praise and thanks.
[3099.94 → 3103.94] And so we gather here today to thank you, to praise you, to worship your name and to gather
[3103.94 → 3105.94] as your people to learn more about you.
[3105.94 → 3112.94] Father, it is only because of your great gift of Jesus Christ that we can gather here and
[3112.94 → 3114.94] know that you have taken our sins away.
[3114.94 → 3137.94] Father, we continue to sin against you daily, and we acknowledge these sins before you and pray that through your spirit we may truly repent of these sins and work to live a life of thankfulness before you.
[3137.94 → 3143.94] Father, this time of prayer is a time to bring before you the needs, hurts, and lives of our congregation.
[3143.94 → 3152.94] There are many times when the church bulletin comes out, and I hope that the list of prayer requests is short or perhaps not there at all.
[3152.94 → 3157.94] As if the only thing we had to do was thank you because only good things are happening.
[3157.94 → 3160.94] But we know, however, that is not the case.
[3160.94 → 3164.94] That sin and Satan still spread hurt and pain throughout our lives.
[3164.94 → 3171.94] And so we want to and need to bring these things before you as you are the only source of true peace and comfort.
[3171.94 → 3178.94] So, Father, we continue to grieve with the Spa family as Deb Spa passed away from COVID recently.
[3178.94 → 3185.94] Peter and Deb and their family were former members of this church and moved to Grand Fork some years ago.
[3185.94 → 3192.94] Our hearts break for the family and friends, and we pray that you will be near to them and surround them with your comfort and grace.
[3192.94 → 3200.94] We also pray for Sarah's brother Patrick who is in the interior in hospital right now also suffering from COVID.
[3200.94 → 3212.94] Father, you are the only one who determines the outcomes of these things and Father, therefore, we pray that you will be with him and grant him healing.
[3212.94 → 3219.94] We pray for our healthcare community and workers as they are in the midst of hardships and the turmoils that are affecting their daily lives.
[3219.94 → 3225.94] And Father, the stresses of these jobs are only growing, and so we pray to be near them during this time.
[3225.94 → 3235.94] We pray for those impacted by the various hurricanes and storms that have wreaked havoc in many communities in North America, claiming lives, homes and communities.
[3235.94 → 3244.94] We pray be with world renewed disaster response volunteers who are working hard to help in the cleanup, rebuilding and recovery of these communities.
[3244.94 → 3251.94] Continue to be with the Haitian people who are suffering greatly following the earthquake and that claimed many lives.
[3251.94 → 3255.94] And then the hurricane that came through on the heels of the earthquake.
[3255.94 → 3261.94] Father, give us a heart to contribute in any way we can to help those people rebuild their lives.
[3261.94 → 3266.94] We remember those suffering in Afghanistan and those who are unable to flee the country.
[3266.94 → 3269.94] We pray that there will be a way for them to escape.
[3269.94 → 3279.94] We pray for safety and provision for them in these extremely volatile and uncertain times.
[3279.94 → 3286.94] Father, we pray for your nearness to all those in our congregation who are isolated, shut in,
[3286.94 → 3292.94] who may be experiencing loneliness, depression and anxiety, illness or other daily hardships.
[3292.94 → 3299.94] We pray for strength and encouragement in their difficulties and protection over them and their caregivers.
[3299.94 → 3305.94] May we also consider how we can reach out and show Christ's love to them.
[3305.94 → 3319.94] We pray for all of us that we will continue to have the patience to practice measures required to be safe and considerate of those with whom we are in contact for the benefit and for the safety of all.
[3319.94 → 3324.94] Father, we pray for this country as we will be having an election tomorrow.
[3324.94 → 3330.94] Father, it is difficult to vote when most of the options do not stand for you and your ways.
[3330.94 → 3334.94] Father, guide our hearts and our pens as we take to the polls.
[3334.94 → 3339.94] And may the new government look to you for guidance in their leadership of this country.
[3339.94 → 3343.94] Father, we also have things to celebrate and be thankful for.
[3343.94 → 3346.94] We give thanks today for the many ministries that are active in this church.
[3346.94 → 3353.94] May we be a blessing and show the love of Christ not only to those in our church, but to the greater community around us.
[3353.94 → 3363.94] We celebrate with the Mural and Adeel families their arrival in Canada on September 16, 2019 and September 19, 2017 respectively.
[3363.94 → 3367.94] The Ajee ls are in the process of acquiring their Canadian citizenship.
[3367.94 → 3374.94] We are thankful to you for seeing them thrive in this new country, in their new country.
[3374.94 → 3380.94] May you continue to bless them and us in our relationship with each, with these families.
[3380.94 → 3389.94] Father, we also pray for a new initiative that the committee is working on with an Eritrean family, a mother and her two children.
[3389.94 → 3394.94] Father, we pray that you will guide this work and help the committee see this through to a positive outcome.
[3394.94 → 3401.94] We are thankful that schools and youth sport are open, and our children can experience these gifts again.
[3401.94 → 3409.94] We pray that you will continue to keep these doors open and strengthen our children through education, sport, social gatherings and our church community.
[3409.94 → 3414.94] Father, may we as a church grow our children's faith and their knowledge of you.
[3414.94 → 3420.94] Father, as we continue in our worship, will you be with us this day?
[3420.94 → 3424.94] Will you strengthen your servant Pastor Chris as he brings us your word?
[3424.94 → 3429.94] Help him to speak clearly and boldly the words that you want us to hear.
[3429.94 → 3433.94] We pray all these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
[3444.94 → 3459.94] So, as we pray, we are going to spend some time together in God's word.
[3459.94 → 3466.94] And so if you've got a Bible, I'm going to encourage you to grab that, open it up or turn it on, whatever the case may be.
[3466.94 → 3470.94] And we're going to spend some time in Jeremiah 17.
[3470.94 → 3473.94] The text that we read will be on the screen.
[3473.94 → 3480.94] But of course, I always encourage you to keep that in front of you as we're going to go back and forth in this text together.
[3480.94 → 3484.94] So you'll have that there.
[3484.94 → 3488.94] With God's word open, let's read together.
[3488.94 → 3493.94] Jeremiah 17, I'm going to begin at verse 5.
[3493.94 → 3496.94] This is what the Lord says.
[3496.94 → 3505.94] Cursed is the one who trusts in man, who draws strength from mere flesh, and whose heart turns away from the Lord.
[3505.94 → 3508.94] That person will be like a bush in the wasteland.
[3508.94 → 3512.94] They will not see prosperity when it comes.
[3512.94 → 3519.94] They will dwell in the parched places of the desert, in a salt land where no one lives.
[3519.94 → 3524.94] But blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord, whose confidence is in him.
[3524.94 → 3531.94] They will be like a tree planted by water that sends out its roots by the stream.
[3531.94 → 3533.94] It does not fear when heat comes.
[3533.94 → 3536.94] Its leaves are always green.
[3536.94 → 3542.94] It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit.
[3542.94 → 3549.94] The heart, deceitful above all things and beyond cure.
[3549.94 → 3553.94] Who can understand it?
[3553.94 → 3567.94] I, the Lord, search the heart and examine the mind to reward each person according to their conduct, according to what their deeds deserve.
[3567.94 → 3574.94] Like a partridge that hatches eggs it did not lay, are those who gain riches by unjust means.
[3574.94 → 3578.94] When their lives are half gone, their riches desert them.
[3578.94 → 3583.94] And in the end, they will prove to be fools.
[3583.94 → 3590.94] A glorious throne, exalted from the beginning, is the place of our sanctuary.
[3590.94 → 3594.94] Lord, you are the hope of Israel.
[3594.94 → 3596.94] All who forsake you will be put to shame.
[3596.94 → 3604.94] Those who turn away from you will be written in the dust, because they have forsaken the Lord, the spring of living water.
[3604.94 → 3614.94] They keep saying to me,
[3614.94 → 3616.94] They keep saying to me,
[3616.94 → 3618.94] Where is the word of the Lord?
[3618.94 → 3621.94] Let it now be fulfilled.
[3621.94 → 3623.94] I have not run away from being your shepherd.
[3623.94 → 3626.94] You know I have not desired the day of despair.
[3626.94 → 3631.94] What passes my lips is open before you.
[3631.94 → 3634.94] Do not be a terror to me.
[3634.94 → 3638.94] You are my refuge in the day of disaster.
[3638.94 → 3642.94] That my persecutors be put to shame, but keep me from shame.
[3642.94 → 3645.94] Let them be terrified, but keep me from terror.
[3645.94 → 3648.94] Bring on the day of disaster.
[3648.94 → 3652.94] Destroy them with double destruction.
[3652.94 → 3655.94] This is the word of the Lord.
[3655.94 → 3667.94] I was in a conversation with someone, and he was a relatively young man.
[3667.94 → 3672.94] He was the new boyfriend of one of the young adults from our church.
[3672.94 → 3677.94] And we started together talking about faith and Christianity.
[3677.94 → 3686.94] And at some point in our conversation, I mentioned to him that the reason I love Christianity is that it helps me to see the world.
[3686.94 → 3692.94] It helps me make sense of the world and to understand my life in the midst of it.
[3692.94 → 3707.94] And in that conversation, I wanted to make clear that this was really more than a God of the gaps kind of worldview or argument, but it really it's about making sense of the whole world and life lived within it.
[3707.94 → 3721.94] If you have received an email from me, from my personal email, not from my church work email, at the very bottom of my email page, there's a quote from C.S. Lewis that says,
[3721.94 → 3725.94] I believe in Christianity as I believe the sun has risen.
[3725.94 → 3732.94] Not only because I see it, but because by it, I see everything else.
[3732.94 → 3739.94] And that's what we're talking about here when we talk about how I love Christianity and our faith.
[3739.94 → 3744.94] Now that quote from Lewis comes in an essay that he wrote called Is Theology Poetry?
[3744.94 → 3745.94] It is a beautiful essay.
[3745.94 → 3746.94] I encourage you to check it out.
[3746.94 → 3749.94] I'll share it with you afterwards if you like.
[3749.94 → 3757.94] But Lewis's conclusion there at the end is that theology is poetry because I believe it to be so.
[3757.94 → 3758.94] Right?
[3758.94 → 3763.94] It's a beautiful essay that he's guided me, and so I see a beauty in it.
[3763.94 → 3768.94] And the gentleman that I was talking with, he looked at me, and he said, that's good for you.
[3768.94 → 3770.94] But I don't have faith.
[3770.94 → 3772.94] I have facts.
[3772.94 → 3776.94] And I don't need faith for my unanswered questions.
[3776.94 → 3779.94] I have a scientific method for finding answers.
[3779.94 → 3784.94] Because if I don't know something, I know that it can be learned.
[3784.94 → 3791.94] Now, for right now, I'm not going to say too much about that line that says, if I don't know something, I know it can be learned.
[3791.94 → 3797.94] Because in reality, it would be more correct to say, if I don't know something, I believe it can be learned.
[3797.94 → 3802.94] Which is a different category and a different conversation, and we can get into that later.
[3802.94 → 3808.94] But it's not just that kind of conversation or that kind of world view.
[3808.94 → 3814.94] Because I've also had people say to me things like, I don't believe in the Christian faith.
[3814.94 → 3816.94] I just believe in nature.
[3816.94 → 3818.94] I believe in the material world.
[3818.94 → 3821.94] The world is, and eventually it won't be.
[3821.94 → 3822.94] Right?
[3822.94 → 3823.94] Right?
[3823.94 → 3829.94] Maybe rather bleakly, they will say something like, I am, and eventually I won't be.
[3829.94 → 3832.94] That's what I think will happen.
[3832.94 → 3838.94] Now, again, I want to say, that's what you trust will happen.
[3838.94 → 3839.94] Right?
[3839.94 → 3847.94] And there's also an area where we can dig into the presumption that says, if there's something to know in the world, it's something that then should be known by all of us.
[3847.94 → 3860.94] Also, in this sort of category of world and life view, I've had conversations with people, and this last one is becoming more and more common in the world today.
[3860.94 → 3866.94] With people who say, something like, I don't need anything like the Christian faith.
[3866.94 → 3867.94] Right?
[3867.94 → 3868.94] I'm spiritual.
[3868.94 → 3869.94] Right?
[3869.94 → 3870.94] I'm a Pisces.
[3870.94 → 3872.94] So, of course, I believe this is true.
[3872.94 → 3873.94] What they say.
[3873.94 → 3874.94] Right?
[3874.94 → 3876.94] This practice of astrology.
[3876.94 → 3877.94] Right?
[3877.94 → 3886.94] People believe in ghosts and in spirits and even in the ability to access and use some sort of immaterial power or force, whatever it's called.
[3886.94 → 3891.94] But then they will then say, there's nothing like an all-powerful transcendent God above it.
[3891.94 → 3892.94] Right?
[3892.94 → 3895.94] What is, is, and there isn't some other.
[3895.94 → 3896.94] Right?
[3896.94 → 3901.94] The spirits that exist in the world in this frame are neutral.
[3901.94 → 3903.94] What matters is how you use them.
[3903.94 → 3908.94] What matters is what you put out into the universe and try to manifest for yourself.
[3908.94 → 3910.94] Does this sound familiar?
[3910.94 → 3911.94] Right?
[3911.94 → 3916.94] If you are on Instagram or other social media, you hear this kind of gospel all the time.
[3916.94 → 3926.94] The point is, right, there are many ways in which all sorts of people exercise all sorts of trust.
[3926.94 → 3927.94] Right?
[3927.94 → 3931.94] Many ways in which people know and people believe.
[3931.94 → 3940.94] The text that we read in Jeremiah asks, who do you trust?
[3940.94 → 3943.94] Trust here meaning, who do you have confidence in?
[3943.94 → 3944.94] Who do you believe?
[3944.94 → 3949.94] Or what or whom will you put your faith in?
[3949.94 → 3955.94] Because the truth of the matter is that everybody has faith.
[3956.94 → 3961.94] Everybody trusts in something outside of them, apart from them, or in them.
[3961.94 → 3962.94] Right?
[3962.94 → 3974.94] Everybody has something or someone or some idea or some sense or some belief or some faith out of which we operate in the world.
[3974.94 → 3977.94] It's impossible to be human otherwise.
[3977.94 → 3989.94] Now, we may not use that language because of a particular aversion or other, but the reality is we all operate out of some sort of deeply held assumptions about how the world works.
[3989.94 → 3991.94] Everyone has some sort of faith.
[3991.94 → 3995.94] This text wants to ask, where is yours?
[3995.94 → 4001.94] As we come into this, I'm reminded of the story of Jesus from the New Testament, Luke 8.
[4001.94 → 4002.94] Right?
[4002.94 → 4005.94] They're in, Jesus and his disciples get in a boat together.
[4005.94 → 4012.94] The wind and the waves rise up, and it looks like the boat is going to be overturned, like it's going to capsize.
[4012.94 → 4013.94] The disciples are terrified.
[4013.94 → 4019.94] They're afraid that they're going to drown, and they cry out to Jesus, Lord, don't you care that we're going to die?
[4019.94 → 4022.94] Jesus gets up.
[4022.94 → 4026.94] He rebukes the wind and the waves and immediately they calm down.
[4026.94 → 4034.94] He turns to his disciples, and he says, where is your faith?
[4034.94 → 4035.94] Now, notice that, right?
[4035.94 → 4038.94] Jesus says, where is your faith?
[4038.94 → 4042.94] He doesn't say, don't you have faith?
[4042.94 → 4043.94] He says, but where is it?
[4043.94 → 4044.94] Right?
[4044.94 → 4046.94] In Jesus' statement there, faith is the given.
[4046.94 → 4049.94] It's presumed that people are operating out of it.
[4049.94 → 4050.94] Right?
[4050.94 → 4053.94] Faith in the people around you or faith in the disciples themselves.
[4053.94 → 4056.94] Faith in the strength of the storm and the natural order of things.
[4056.94 → 4057.94] Where is your faith?
[4057.94 → 4058.94] Jesus says.
[4058.94 → 4062.94] Either it's in me or it's not.
[4062.94 → 4065.94] Where is your faith?
[4065.94 → 4071.94] In the boat story that Jesus, that we get in Luke 8, the question is where is your faith?
[4071.94 → 4072.94] Right?
[4072.94 → 4075.94] Is it in the Lord, in the one who can calm the wind and the waves?
[4075.94 → 4081.94] Or if he doesn't calm the wind and the waves, the one who has a good reason for you to be in the storm in the first place.
[4081.94 → 4085.94] Is your faith in him or is it somewhere else?
[4085.94 → 4091.94] Or as Jeremiah asked it, is your faith or your trust in man?
[4091.94 → 4092.94] Right?
[4092.94 → 4098.94] In people, in yourself, in your own ability, your own strength, your own prowess.
[4098.94 → 4106.94] Is your trust in the Lord and is your confidence in him or is it in yourself?
[4106.94 → 4112.94] There's an image that Jeremiah gives that we're going to hang on to, and I'm going to put it in your mind.
[4112.94 → 4119.94] It says, are you a bush in the wasteland, dry and weary and dying?
[4119.94 → 4123.94] Or are you a tree planted by water?
[4123.94 → 4130.94] So it would be good as we dig here in this first point to look at what it means to be that bush in the wasteland.
[4130.94 → 4133.94] I'm going to call that the disappointment of misplaced faith.
[4133.94 → 4138.94] And so if you're writing notes, you can write that, the disappointment of misplaced faith.
[4138.94 → 4141.94] What does it mean to be a bush in the wasteland?
[4143.94 → 4145.94] You are a bush in the wasteland.
[4145.94 → 4148.94] We read that you don't see true prosperity.
[4148.94 → 4151.94] You will not see prosperity when it comes.
[4151.94 → 4154.94] We read that you're always parched.
[4154.94 → 4156.94] You live in the parched places.
[4156.94 → 4159.94] That's an image that says you will always be parched.
[4159.94 → 4161.94] You are never satisfied.
[4161.94 → 4165.94] Ecclesiastes uses the image of chasing after the wind.
[4165.94 → 4169.94] And when you try and grab hold of it, finally you open your hands just to realize that it's empty.
[4169.94 → 4171.94] Never satisfied.
[4172.94 → 4174.94] It doesn't work.
[4174.94 → 4178.94] Because the truth is, right, you aren't created to live like this.
[4178.94 → 4183.94] You aren't created for the desert of barrenness or of emptiness.
[4183.94 → 4193.94] The language here and the images here in verse 5 and 6 and then tying in 7 and 8, in my mind anyway, as I read it, takes us all the way back to the Garden of Eden.
[4193.94 → 4194.94] Right?
[4194.94 → 4206.94] Where Adam and Eve first walked with God in the cool of the day, surrounded by his presence and the beauty of an unmarred creation, an unstained by sin creation.
[4206.94 → 4210.94] And then when sin comes into the world, they are expelled from this beautiful garden.
[4210.94 → 4213.94] They're told that working will be a toil.
[4213.94 → 4214.94] It will be hard.
[4214.94 → 4216.94] The ground will be rough.
[4218.94 → 4223.94] And it all happens because they put their faith in someone other than God.
[4223.94 → 4225.94] They believed in themselves.
[4225.94 → 4228.94] They believed that they knew better than God.
[4228.94 → 4233.94] That they could figure out a better life than the creator of life himself.
[4234.94 → 4239.94] Fundamentally, that's the pride at root of every sin.
[4240.94 → 4247.94] From Satan's sin to your sin, the idea at root is that you have a better idea than God.
[4247.94 → 4264.94] And as long as we are operating out of this world view, as long as we are operating out of this stuck place, we will always be that bush in the wasteland, chasing after the wind, never satisfied, never filled, always part.
[4265.94 → 4271.94] Now, I want you to see something because at this point, we can start creating our own stories.
[4271.94 → 4276.94] In this text, that person will be like a bush in the wasteland.
[4276.94 → 4279.94] They will not see prosperity when it comes.
[4283.94 → 4284.94] What did that person do before?
[4285.94 → 4286.94] In verse 5,
[4286.94 → 4294.94] Cursed is the one who trusts in man, who draws strength from mere flesh, and whose heart turns away from the Lord.
[4294.94 → 4304.94] Right? Seeing prosperity, or not being able to see prosperity, happens because we've turned away from the Lord.
[4305.94 → 4309.94] And so, if we're going to see prosperity, we need to turn back to the Lord.
[4309.94 → 4312.94] And again, prosperity is seeing the Lord.
[4313.94 → 4315.94] It's not having more of one thing or another.
[4315.94 → 4317.94] It's not having the nicest car or the nicest house.
[4317.94 → 4322.94] Prosperity is seeing God for who he is.
[4322.94 → 4327.94] So easily, we make it about something else.
[4327.94 → 4328.94] Right?
[4328.94 → 4334.94] I've already alluded to this, but in the sort of Instagrammification of culture that has happened,
[4335.94 → 4338.94] a new prosperity gospel has emerged.
[4339.94 → 4340.94] Right?
[4340.94 → 4343.94] One that says, you've got to live your joy.
[4343.94 → 4344.94] Right?
[4344.94 → 4345.94] Seek your passion.
[4345.94 → 4346.94] Right?
[4346.94 → 4347.94] Find your best life now.
[4347.94 → 4349.94] Do what sparks joy.
[4349.94 → 4350.94] Right?
[4350.94 → 4357.94] The spirituality of places like Instagram is full of nebulous one-liners and an anemic promise of faith.
[4357.94 → 4359.94] But there's nothing there.
[4360.94 → 4371.94] And yet, as of the way social media works, because of the way these sorts of things have the tendency to speak to our programmed mind,
[4371.94 → 4380.94] we like it, we share it, and we contribute to this passing on of this new prosperity gospel.
[4380.94 → 4387.94] But the reality is, right, of our Christian faith is that Jesus doesn't promise ease or comfort.
[4388.94 → 4389.94] Right?
[4389.94 → 4392.94] He doesn't promise protection from bad or hard things.
[4392.94 → 4397.94] What he promises is his presence in the midst of those hard things.
[4400.94 → 4405.94] And that is the strength of a planted faith.
[4406.94 → 4407.94] Right?
[4407.94 → 4410.94] The image of a tree by streams of water.
[4411.94 → 4412.94] Right?
[4412.94 → 4415.94] That does not fear when the heat comes.
[4415.94 → 4417.94] Notice, the heat comes.
[4417.94 → 4420.94] But why can you not be afraid?
[4421.94 → 4422.94] Right?
[4422.94 → 4424.94] That has no worries in a year of drought.
[4424.94 → 4426.94] Notice, the drought comes.
[4426.94 → 4427.94] But why don't we worry?
[4431.94 → 4433.94] Now, how many of you believe the Bible to be true?
[4433.94 → 4434.94] I want interactive here.
[4434.94 → 4435.94] Raise your hand.
[4435.94 → 4437.94] If you believe the Bible to be true, raise your hand.
[4437.94 → 4438.94] If you don't, I'm taking notes.
[4438.94 → 4439.94] We're going to talk after.
[4441.94 → 4442.94] Right?
[4442.94 → 4443.94] How many of you believe the Bible to be true?
[4444.94 → 4447.94] And now, if you raise your hand, I want to ask you, really?
[4452.94 → 4456.94] What about God works all things for the good of those who love him who have been called according to his purpose?
[4457.94 → 4458.94] Because all things means all things.
[4458.94 → 4460.94] So what about that thing that broke you?
[4463.94 → 4464.94] Believe that?
[4464.94 → 4469.94] What about Philippians 2, verse 14?
[4469.94 → 4474.94] And I think this is a great one for today in the midst of this protracted COVID conversation where it says,
[4475.94 → 4477.94] Do everything without grumbling or arguing.
[4479.94 → 4480.94] How many of you believe the Bible to be true?
[4483.94 → 4484.94] Really?
[4485.94 → 4487.94] Because everything means everything.
[4487.94 → 4488.94] Right?
[4489.94 → 4491.94] Now, don't hear what I'm not saying.
[4491.94 → 4492.94] Right?
[4492.94 → 4493.94] I don't want to guilt us or shame us.
[4493.94 → 4495.94] I want to convict us, maybe.
[4495.94 → 4496.94] But I don't want to shame us.
[4496.94 → 4501.94] But imagine, with me, imagine what our church would look like.
[4501.94 → 4506.94] Imagine what your life would look like if we actually believed what we say we believed.
[4507.94 → 4508.94] Right?
[4509.94 → 4514.94] If we lived like our profession of faith was true all the time, everywhere, in every circumstance.
[4514.94 → 4520.94] Imagine what kind of force that would be in this world for God.
[4521.94 → 4533.94] But if the Bible is true, and I believe it is, and I trust that you want to believe it is, when the heat comes, you don't need to be afraid.
[4533.94 → 4534.94] Right?
[4534.94 → 4539.94] But if the Bible is true, when the drought comes, you don't need to worry.
[4540.94 → 4542.94] When the storm comes, you don't have to have fear.
[4543.94 → 4544.94] Right?
[4544.94 → 4545.94] You can have faith.
[4545.94 → 4548.94] Faith that God has a purpose, and His purpose is good.
[4548.94 → 4549.94] Right?
[4549.94 → 4560.94] If God is sovereign, and I believe that He is, and I believe that the Bible clearly states that He is, if God is sovereign, that means everything that happens, happens according to His will.
[4560.94 → 4567.94] Now, some of you are immediately getting triggered, and so we can have a conversation later about the philosophy of active and passive will.
[4567.94 → 4572.94] We can parse out the finer distinctions of efficient causality and final causality.
[4572.94 → 4582.94] We can do all of that if you want, or not, because at the end of the day, and at the beginning, if God is sovereign, what happens, happens only because He willed it.
[4582.94 → 4589.94] And if He willed it, that means somehow, in some way, it is meant for your good.
[4591.94 → 4601.94] Even a global pandemic is somehow meant, in the sovereign will of God, for your good.
[4602.94 → 4607.94] Is your God big enough for that to be true?
[4607.94 → 4611.94] Because I've got to tell you, the God of the Bible certainly is.
[4612.94 → 4614.94] Now think about that for a moment.
[4614.94 → 4615.94] Right?
[4615.94 → 4623.94] Think about the comfort and the joy and the unshakeable truth that God is in control of all things, and how that changes your life.
[4623.94 → 4632.94] Think about how that changes how you see life, whether it's your struggles, or your diseases, your depression, your illnesses, right?
[4632.94 → 4634.94] The death of a loved one.
[4634.94 → 4639.94] If God is that big, if He is really that sovereign, right?
[4639.94 → 4650.94] This big and sovereign God who works all things for His glory and our good, that means somehow, in some way, God is always in the mix.
[4650.94 → 4653.94] God is in the darkest moment of your life.
[4653.94 → 4656.94] God is in the hardest moment of your life.
[4656.94 → 4661.94] God is in the most difficult, atrocious things that have ever happened to you.
[4661.94 → 4666.94] He is there.
[4666.94 → 4669.94] You may not see Him.
[4669.94 → 4677.94] And you may not ever, this side of heaven, know why or how, but He is there.
[4677.94 → 4680.94] And you don't need to be afraid.
[4680.94 → 4682.94] You don't need to worry.
[4682.94 → 4688.94] You don't need to be scared or to hide in a corner or to isolate yourself and to give up hope.
[4688.94 → 4691.94] Because God is there.
[4693.94 → 4700.94] That's what Jeremiah means when he says that a glorious throne is our sanctuary.
[4700.94 → 4714.94] The absolute, all-sovereign power of God, the God who rules and reigns over everything, is the only sanctuary in the midst of a storm and trial.
[4714.94 → 4716.94] And let's be really clear, right?
[4716.94 → 4720.94] Sanctuary doesn't come by being saved from the storm.
[4720.94 → 4727.94] Sanctuary comes by being saved in the storm.
[4727.94 → 4743.94] In the 19th century, there was a pastor and orphanage worker in England whose name was George Muller.
[4743.94 → 4752.94] George Muller founded an institute called the Scripture Knowledge Institute for Home and Abroad.
[4752.94 → 4760.94] The primary goals of this institute were teaching the Bible, giving away Bibles, supporting missionaries, and providing orphan care.
[4760.94 → 4770.94] In 1834, when George started, there was 3,600 orphans that had housing in all of England.
[4770.94 → 4774.94] And twice as many under the age of eight were in prison.
[4774.94 → 4777.94] The rest lived on the streets.
[4777.94 → 4785.94] In his lifetime, Muller built five orphan houses that cared for over 10,000 new orphans.
[4785.94 → 4790.94] He, in this work, tripled the care of orphans in England.
[4790.94 → 4791.94] One man.
[4791.94 → 4794.94] But that's not what I want you to hear about him.
[4794.94 → 4798.94] Do you know how he funded his operation?
[4798.94 → 4805.94] An operation that housed more than 10,000 orphans, that taught over 16,000 kids and adults, that supported missionaries around the world.
[4805.94 → 4807.94] How did he fund that?
[4807.94 → 4809.94] He prayed.
[4809.94 → 4811.94] That's all he did.
[4811.94 → 4815.94] Not once did he ask people for money.
[4815.94 → 4821.94] Not once did he ask his teams to go out and fundraise.
[4821.94 → 4822.94] Right?
[4822.94 → 4824.94] He didn't ask his employees for money.
[4824.94 → 4829.94] He prayed with the need and time and time again, God satisfied.
[4829.94 → 4833.94] He tells incredible stories of praying and then somebody showing up with a banknote.
[4833.94 → 4835.94] He never took out a loan from a bank.
[4835.94 → 4837.94] He never borrowed in private interest.
[4837.94 → 4846.94] He prayed, and his prayer was answered over and over and over again to the tune of what, by today's standards, would be millions of dollars.
[4846.94 → 4850.94] But that's still not what I want you to hear about him.
[4850.94 → 4859.94] Because you see, George Muller's wife contracted rheumatic fever.
[4859.94 → 4863.94] And she died from it at age 57.
[4863.94 → 4866.94] These are the words that he preached at her funeral.
[4866.94 → 4868.94] This is what I want you to hear.
[4868.94 → 4870.94] He said,
[4870.94 → 4875.94] When I heard the doctor's judgment that it was rheumatic fever, I expected the worst.
[4875.94 → 4879.94] My heart was nigh to be broken on account of the depth of my affection.
[4879.94 → 4884.94] And when he went on, he then goes on to explain how he was strengthened during these times.
[4884.94 → 4886.94] And this is from him.
[4886.94 → 4891.94] The last portion of scripture which I read to my precious wife was this.
[4891.94 → 4893.94] This is from Psalm 84.
[4893.94 → 4897.94] The Lord God is a sun and shield.
[4897.94 → 4899.94] The Lord will give grace and glory.
[4899.94 → 4904.94] No good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.
[4904.94 → 4906.94] Muller goes on.
[4906.94 → 4913.94] Now, if we have believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, we have received grace, and we are partakers of grace.
[4913.94 → 4917.94] And to all such he will give glory also.
[4917.94 → 4920.94] I said to myself with regard to the latter part,
[4920.94 → 4923.94] No good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.
[4923.94 → 4929.94] I in myself am a poor and worthless sinner, but I have been saved by the blood of Christ.
[4929.94 → 4931.94] And I do not live in sin.
[4931.94 → 4933.94] I walk uprightly before God.
[4933.94 → 4934.94] And here it is.
[4934.94 → 4935.94] Here it is.
[4935.94 → 4941.94] Therefore, if it is perfect for me, my darling wife will be raised up again, sick as she is.
[4941.94 → 4944.94] God will restore her again.
[4944.94 → 4949.94] But if she is not restored again, then it would not be a good thing for me.
[4949.94 → 4952.94] And so my heart is at rest.
[4952.94 → 4955.94] And I will be satisfied with God.
[4955.94 → 4962.94] And all this springs, Muller concludes, from taking God at his word.
[4962.94 → 4965.94] From believing what he says.
[4965.94 → 4968.94] You believe the Bible.
[4968.94 → 4981.94] The one who got millions of dollars in response to his prayers for the orphans did not get his one prayer answered for healing in his wife.
[4981.94 → 4987.94] Instead, he got something which he believed to be better.
[4987.94 → 4992.94] To know a great God who gives only good gifts.
[4992.94 → 5008.94] Muller believed because the Bible told him that even this heartbreak, even this tragedy, somehow, in some way, for God's glory is good.
[5008.94 → 5014.94] Now, I don't know how that that is true.
[5014.94 → 5018.94] But I do know that it is true.
[5018.94 → 5020.94] Here's the catch.
[5020.94 → 5027.94] You can't become this kind of person on your own.
[5027.94 → 5034.94] The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure.
[5034.94 → 5036.94] We try to trick ourselves.
[5036.94 → 5037.94] Right?
[5037.94 → 5040.94] We convince ourselves that it's all right.
[5040.94 → 5041.94] That we don't need God.
[5041.94 → 5042.94] That there's another way.
[5042.94 → 5043.94] A better way.
[5043.94 → 5044.94] An easier way.
[5044.94 → 5047.94] But the truth is all over the Bible.
[5047.94 → 5052.94] The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure.
[5052.94 → 5057.94] And Obadiah says, the pride of your heart has deceived you.
[5057.94 → 5060.94] You who say to yourself, who can bring me down to the ground?
[5060.94 → 5061.94] Right?
[5061.94 → 5066.94] 1 John 1, if we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.
[5066.94 → 5071.94] James 1, do not merely listen to the word and so deceive yourselves.
[5071.94 → 5072.94] Do what it says.
[5072.94 → 5075.94] The heart is deceitful and beyond cure.
[5075.94 → 5080.94] This is what the reformers 500 years ago began to call the bondage of the will.
[5080.94 → 5083.94] You cannot save yourself.
[5083.94 → 5089.94] Jeremiah doesn't pull any punches this morning.
[5089.94 → 5099.94] I, the Lord, search the heart and examine the mind to reward each person according to their conduct.
[5099.94 → 5105.94] Lord, you are the hope of Israel.
[5105.94 → 5108.94] All who forsake you will be put to shame.
[5108.94 → 5113.94] Those who turn away from you will be ridden in the dust because they have forsaken the Lord.
[5113.94 → 5118.94] All have sinned.
[5118.94 → 5121.94] Fall short of the glory of God.
[5121.94 → 5125.94] Make no mistake about it.
[5125.94 → 5127.94] This morning.
[5127.94 → 5134.94] In a culture and a time and place that wants everything to be easy and comfortable,
[5134.94 → 5140.94] that wishes the reality of sin and the consequence of sin in the doctrine of hell wasn't true,
[5140.94 → 5143.94] the Bible comes along and says,
[5143.94 → 5147.94] this is the word of the Lord.
[5147.94 → 5153.94] But because we can't do it ourselves,
[5153.94 → 5161.94] we cling to a God who has done it for us.
[5161.94 → 5166.94] Heal me, Lord, and I will be healed.
[5166.94 → 5169.94] Save me, and I will be saved.
[5169.94 → 5173.94] This God who gives us this promise, who asks,
[5173.94 → 5179.94] who do you trust, displays over and over again in the person of Jesus Christ
[5179.94 → 5185.94] why he is ultimately trustworthy, why he is ultimately worthy of our praise.
[5185.94 → 5189.94] Because Jesus, God himself, the second person of the eternal trinity,
[5189.94 → 5192.94] took on flesh and made his dwelling among us.
[5192.94 → 5197.94] Jesus who came into this world perfect and lived the life I should have lived.
[5197.94 → 5204.94] Jesus who died the death that I deserve, that you deserve, who paid the punishment for our sin.
[5204.94 → 5210.94] Jesus who was raised victorious three days later and is now seated at the right hand of God the Father.
[5210.94 → 5213.94] This same Jesus reaches out to you and says,
[5213.94 → 5216.94] new creation, new life reaches out to you and says,
[5216.94 → 5218.94] you are no longer defined by sin.
[5218.94 → 5222.94] You are no longer slaves and bound in your will to this old way of being.
[5222.94 → 5225.94] You are mine.
[5225.94 → 5228.94] You are new.
[5228.94 → 5233.94] The brokenness of our relationship, Jesus brings.
[5233.94 → 5238.94] Healing in the reality of our sin, Jesus brings salvation.
[5238.94 → 5244.94] To the loneliness and isolation we feel, Jesus brings family.
[5245.94 → 5246.94] New family.
[5246.94 → 5247.94] Together.
[5247.94 → 5250.94] It's God's people.
[5256.94 → 5262.94] For those of us who know this new life.
[5262.94 → 5265.94] For those of us who are struggling to believe and crying out,
[5265.94 → 5267.94] Lord, help my unbelief.
[5267.94 → 5271.94] For those of us who know what it is to be healed and saved.
[5271.94 → 5276.94] We live in a time and place, not unlike Jeremiah, who had people surrounding him saying,
[5276.94 → 5277.94] where is the word of the Lord?
[5277.94 → 5279.94] Where is your God?
[5279.94 → 5288.94] We live in a time and place where we are challenged in our trust and in our belief.
[5288.94 → 5292.94] Jeremiah says, I have not run away from being your shepherd.
[5293.94 → 5297.94] I have not given up in the task that you have called me to.
[5297.94 → 5304.94] So, here, today, we are challenged in our belief.
[5304.94 → 5309.94] We are challenged out of the love of God for us.
[5309.94 → 5317.94] We are challenged that our belief might lead to an affection, to a heart for God's purposes and God's work in the world.
[5317.94 → 5320.94] And we are called to the city.
[5320.94 → 5330.94] Now, the city here is a placeholder for Durbanville, for Langley, for wherever you happen to be in your life, in your context of mission.
[5330.94 → 5332.94] And so, maybe it's a farm.
[5332.94 → 5333.94] Maybe it's a classroom.
[5333.94 → 5334.94] Maybe it's an office.
[5334.94 → 5336.94] Maybe it's a coffee shop.
[5336.94 → 5357.94] But each one of us, all of you, are sent out with this belief in this love and with this love from God's heart for you to your heart and then out of your heart to whomever and wherever you go.
[5357.94 → 5363.94] And God has healed himself in power.
[5363.94 → 5368.94] Will you live in that power?
[5368.94 → 5372.94] Will you live in the truth of his word?
[5374.94 → 5380.94] After service, we have ministries and missions who are out there in the foyer.
[5380.94 → 5391.94] All of those opportunities and places are instances of God at work in the world through our church.
[5391.94 → 5401.94] They are part of how we and how you live your belief and love in the city.
[5401.94 → 5407.94] Langley, Surrey, Vancouver, wherever you are, you're online wherever you are.
[5407.94 → 5412.94] This is God's mission.
[5412.94 → 5419.94] And on the firm foundation of his word, he invites us to go with him.
[5419.94 → 5422.94] I'm going to go.
[5422.94 → 5423.94] You want to come?
[5423.94 → 5426.94] You want to see what God's going to do?
[5426.94 → 5428.94] Because I'm excited.
[5428.94 → 5429.94] Let's see what God's going to do.
[5429.94 → 5431.94] Let's pray together.
[5431.94 → 5438.94] Lord our God, do your thing.
[5438.94 → 5444.94] Exercise your sovereign power and call us out of darkness into your wonderful light.
[5444.94 → 5448.94] Call us out of our comfort zones into the places where you are leading and guiding.
[5448.94 → 5458.94] God, we don't know exactly where you are taking us, but we want to follow in devotion.
[5458.94 → 5465.94] We want to come after you even as you have come after us in Jesus Christ.
[5465.94 → 5471.94] And so, Lord God, send us out today in the power of your Holy Spirit.
[5471.94 → 5474.94] Send us out in the conviction of your truth.
[5474.94 → 5479.94] Send us out in the belief that you are God.
[5479.94 → 5491.94] God, you, good, that you go with us wherever you go.
[5491.94 → 5500.94] You call us and promise to provide and equip us for the journey of life and faith.
[5500.94 → 5502.94] Where is your faith?
[5502.94 → 5504.94] Where is your faith?
[5504.94 → 5505.94] There is in you.
[5505.94 → 5508.94] May it always, only, ever be.
[5508.94 → 5511.94] In Jesus' name we pray.
[5511.94 → 5513.94] Amen.
[5513.94 → 5515.94] Amen.
[5515.94 → 5540.94] You hear me when I call.
[5540.94 → 5542.94] Are you still like, Lord, only song
[5542.94 → 5546.06] Though darkness kills the night
[5546.06 → 5549.36] Yes, come on, like this, child
[5549.36 → 5553.12] Who shall I be?
[5555.54 → 5557.94] You crushed the enemy
[5557.94 → 5561.76] Underneath my feet
[5561.76 → 5564.84] You are my storage shield
[5564.84 → 5567.94] The troubled, printers still
[5567.94 → 5572.24] Who shall I be?
[5574.32 → 5577.50] I know He's looking for me
[5577.50 → 5580.58] I know He stands in mind
[5580.58 → 5583.88] The God of angel armies
[5583.88 → 5586.94] Is always by my side
[5586.94 → 5589.92] The one who reigns forever
[5589.92 → 5593.18] He is a friend of mine
[5593.18 → 5596.56] The God of angel armies
[5596.56 → 5600.16] Is always by my side
[5600.16 → 5609.20] The grace is in your name
[5609.20 → 5612.32] For you alone can stay
[5612.32 → 5615.50] You will deliver me
[5615.50 → 5618.64] Yours is the victory
[5618.64 → 5622.70] Who shall I be?
[5626.56 → 5629.52] Who shall I be?
[5632.74 → 5635.92] I know He calls me glory
[5635.92 → 5639.20] I know He stands behind
[5639.20 → 5642.80] The God of angel armies
[5642.80 → 5645.66] Is always by my side
[5645.66 → 5648.84] The one who reigns forever
[5648.84 → 5652.16] He is a friend of mine
[5652.16 → 5655.44] The God of angel armies
[5655.44 → 5659.40] Is always by my side
[5659.40 → 5665.00] Against me shall I be?
[5665.00 → 5673.00] You hold the whole world in your hand
[5673.00 → 5678.60] I'm holding on to your promises
[5678.60 → 5681.96] You are faithful
[5681.96 → 5685.24] You are faithful
[5685.24 → 5689.60] And nothing formed against me
[5689.60 → 5693.20] He shall stand
[5693.20 → 5699.20] You hold the whole world in your hands
[5699.20 → 5704.48] I'm holding on to your promises
[5704.48 → 5707.08] You are faithful
[5707.08 → 5708.08] You are faithful
[5708.08 → 5710.96] You are faithful
[5710.96 → 5714.16] You are faithful
[5714.16 → 5714.64] You are faithful
[5717.76 → 5719.84] I know He will deliver me
[5719.84 → 5721.60] I know He is faithful
[5721.60 → 5722.84] I know He will come
[5722.84 → 5725.70] I know who stands behind.
[5725.70 → 5732.38] The God of angel armies is always by my side.
[5732.50 → 5738.84] The one who reigns forever, he is a friend of mine.
[5739.38 → 5745.52] The God of angel armies is always by my side.
[5745.52 → 5753.58] The God of angel armies is always by my side.
[5761.58 → 5766.68] As you go, know that God goes with you.
[5767.12 → 5773.68] And so receive his blessing, his provision for the journey of life and faith ahead.
[5775.52 → 5778.44] May God go before you to lead you.
[5779.18 → 5781.48] May God go behind you to protect you.
[5782.38 → 5784.52] May God go beneath you to support you.
[5785.14 → 5787.58] May God go beside you to befriend you.
[5787.94 → 5789.84] Do not be afraid.
[5790.64 → 5792.60] Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[5792.72 → 5794.30] Do not be afraid.
[5795.16 → 5799.36] Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
[5800.70 → 5801.30] Amen.
[5805.52 → 5823.36] I know he rescued my soul.
[5824.36 → 5826.96] His blood covered my sin.
[5826.96 → 5827.96] I believe.
[5827.96 → 5828.18] I believe.
[5828.18 → 5828.24] I believe.
[5828.24 → 5828.74] I believe.
