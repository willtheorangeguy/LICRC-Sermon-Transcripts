[0.00 → 10.44] With all that I am, to your throne of grace, you've done the rest.
[10.54 → 15.76] Your cross, my confidence, your death, my plea.
[17.14 → 22.94] Your resurrection, my cry of victory.
[22.94 → 26.56] You fight of everything.
[26.56 → 34.04] There's nothing left, and all I do is come.
[34.96 → 37.98] You've done the rest.
[38.36 → 41.32] You've done the rest.
[41.70 → 44.60] You've done the rest.
[44.76 → 47.50] All I do is come.
[48.50 → 50.48] You've done the rest.
[56.56 → 64.04] All I do is come.
[64.04 → 64.96] All I do is come.
[64.96 → 72.44] All I do is come.
[72.44 → 74.44] All I do is come.
[74.44 → 81.92] All I do is come.
[81.92 → 83.92] All I do is come.
[83.92 → 85.92] All I do is come.
[85.92 → 93.40] All I do is come.
[93.40 → 95.40] All I do is come.
[95.40 → 99.40] All I do is come.
[99.40 → 102.40] I know I'm alive.
[102.40 → 105.40] I'm alive.
[105.40 → 114.88] I know I'm alive.
[114.88 → 118.88] I know I'm alive.
[118.88 → 132.36] All I do is come.
[132.36 → 145.84] All I do is come.
[145.84 → 151.84] All I do is come.
[151.84 → 165.32] All I do is come.
[165.32 → 167.32] All I do is come.
[167.32 → 169.32] All I do is come.

[215.28 → 222.28] You've done the rest.
[222.28 → 227.72] You've done the rest.
[227.72 → 237.62] You've done the rest.
[237.62 → 242.82] You've done the rest.
[242.82 → 244.58] You've done the rest.
[244.58 → 247.18] You've done the rest.
[247.18 → 248.16] You've done the rest.
[248.16 → 249.16] Amen.
[278.16 → 280.16] Amen.
[308.16 → 310.16] Amen.
[338.16 → 340.16] Amen.
[368.16 → 370.16] Amen.
[398.16 → 400.16] Amen.
[428.16 → 430.16] Amen.
[458.16 → 460.16] Amen.
[488.16 → 490.16] Amen.
[518.16 → 520.16] Amen.
[548.16 → 550.16] Amen.
[578.16 → 579.16] Amen.
[586.22 → 605.50] Good morning and welcome to worship.
[605.50 → 608.94] We are so excited that you are here with us this morning.
[609.48 → 612.62] My name is Chris, and I'm pastor here at Langley Emanuel,
[612.76 → 615.58] and it is my privilege, along with those whom you see on stage
[615.58 → 618.10] and a few others here in the building,
[618.30 → 622.56] to lead you and provide this opportunity to worship together.
[623.20 → 626.14] Today, our service has a few different elements in it,
[626.16 → 628.46] and we are really excited to share that with you
[628.46 → 632.24] as we celebrate in the baptism of Anna Kleingeltink,
[632.24 → 635.88] as we share with you some nomination process
[635.88 → 639.62] and things that we have coming and going on here.
[639.72 → 642.18] We are really excited just to bring that all together
[642.18 → 645.82] into the presence of our God and praise his name for it.
[646.30 → 649.74] I want to invite you to, after our service together,
[649.98 → 654.46] join with other members of our church for a Zoom coffee meeting
[654.46 → 657.44] that will take place beginning around 1130.
[657.54 → 660.88] The link for that is in the e-bulletin that you should have received.
[660.88 → 664.10] And you can click on that link and join us
[664.10 → 668.42] as we spend time-sharing life and story together at that moment.
[669.08 → 672.60] We gather because God has called us to worship him.
[672.76 → 675.92] We gather because God carries us into his presence
[675.92 → 680.38] that he might welcome us here and feed our souls.
[680.62 → 683.62] And so wherever you are, I invite you to open your heart,
[683.78 → 687.28] open your hands, stand, take on whatever posture you need to
[687.28 → 692.74] to receive the greeting of our God as he welcomes us into worship today.
[694.74 → 699.52] Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father,
[699.62 → 702.40] from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Saviour,
[702.86 → 705.60] through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[706.50 → 707.10] Amen.
[707.94 → 708.78] Worship God together.
[708.78 → 718.96] Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 34.
[720.68 → 724.08] Taste and see that the Lord is good.
[725.22 → 728.22] Blessed is the one who takes refuge in him.
[729.66 → 732.78] Fear the Lord, you his holy people.
[732.78 → 736.58] For those who fear him lack nothing.
[736.58 → 740.48] The lions may grow weak and hungry,
[740.96 → 745.08] but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing.
[745.08 → 768.76] Our Father who art in heaven,
[768.76 → 769.76] come and let your glory come and let your glory come.
[769.76 → 773.92] Hallowed be thy name.
[774.76 → 779.76] Come and let your glory come and let your glory come.
[781.76 → 786.58] Our Father who art in heaven,
[787.48 → 790.76] the rocks cry out your fame.
[791.76 → 796.76] Come and let your glory come and let your glory come.
[796.76 → 803.76] I will sing, sing, sing a new song.
[803.76 → 807.76] I will sing, sing a new song.
[807.76 → 814.76] I will sing, sing a new song to the Lord.
[817.14 → 820.76] Let your kingdom come, let your will be done.
[820.76 → 821.76] God, give us new song.
[821.76 → 824.76] On earth as it is in heaven.
[824.76 → 829.76] Every heart will play, it's the first day of your name.
[829.76 → 833.76] On earth as it is in heaven.
[833.76 → 834.76] God, give us new song.
[834.76 → 846.76] God, give us new every morning.
[846.76 → 850.76] Mercy as daily bread.
[850.76 → 851.76] Please join, amen.
[851.76 → 852.76] In the name of Jesus.
[852.76 → 859.76] In the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus we pray.
[859.76 → 869.36] And lead us not to temptation, but deliver us with your hand.
[869.90 → 877.50] In the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus we pray, Father we pray.
[877.50 → 894.64] I will sing, sing a new song to the Lord.
[895.14 → 903.18] Let your kingdom come, let your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
[903.18 → 911.98] Every heart will praise the mercy of your name, on earth as it is in heaven.
[912.58 → 919.76] For the kingdom is yours, and the power is yours, and glory forever, amen.
[921.12 → 928.36] And the kingdom is yours, and the power is yours, and glory forever, amen.
[928.36 → 936.76] For the kingdom is yours, and the power is yours, and glory forever, amen.
[937.96 → 945.82] And the kingdom is yours, and the power is yours, and glory forever, amen.
[946.32 → 954.56] Let your kingdom come, let your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
[954.56 → 963.04] Every heart proclaim the mercy of your name, on earth as it is in heaven.
[963.38 → 971.38] Let your kingdom come, let your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
[972.02 → 979.84] Every heart proclaim the mercy of your name, on earth as it is in heaven.
[979.84 → 981.84] Amen.
[981.84 → 982.50] Amen.
[994.50 → 997.86] Pray with me this morning our prayer of confession.
[1000.18 → 1006.78] Father God, giver of all good gifts, sustainer of life, our provider,
[1006.78 → 1012.08] we pray that you will help us to see your mercies new every morning.
[1013.14 → 1014.52] Help us to be thankful.
[1015.76 → 1018.56] Help us to know your goodness and trust in it.
[1019.32 → 1022.56] We so often try to control what we think we can,
[1023.34 → 1026.24] and struggle against a world that says it has it all.
[1027.02 → 1029.74] But you are the only true provider.
[1030.82 → 1033.90] We pray for your mercy when we don't trust in you.
[1033.90 → 1037.88] We pray for hearts open to receive your gifts.
[1038.88 → 1043.04] Thank you that every good and perfect gift comes from you.
[1044.04 → 1044.38] Amen.
[1044.38 → 1044.54] Amen.
[1044.54 → 1044.56] Amen.
[1044.56 → 1044.58] Amen.
[1044.58 → 1044.62] Amen.
[1044.62 → 1046.62] Amen.
[1046.62 → 1048.62] Amen.
[1048.62 → 1050.62] Amen.
[1050.62 → 1052.62] Amen.
[1052.62 → 1053.62] Amen.
[1053.62 → 1054.62] Amen.
[1054.62 → 1055.62] Amen.
[1055.62 → 1056.62] Amen.
[1056.62 → 1057.62] Amen.
[1057.62 → 1059.62] Amen.
[1059.62 → 1060.62] Amen.
[1060.62 → 1061.62] Amen.
[1061.62 → 1062.62] Amen.
[1063.90 → 1064.28] Amen.
[1064.28 → 1064.52] Amen.
[1089.96 → 1092.10] Amen.
[1092.10 → 1092.20] Amen.
[1092.20 → 1092.56] Amen.
[1092.56 → 1093.88] Amen.
[1093.88 → 1116.08] Oh Lord, you are my home, your promise never fails me, and my desire is to follow you forever.
[1116.08 → 1137.94] For you are good. For you are good. For you are good to me.
[1137.94 → 1155.02] I cry out for your hand of mercy to heal me. I am weak. I need your love to free me.
[1155.02 → 1175.06] O Lord, my wrath, my strength and weakness, come rescue me. O Lord, you are my hope.
[1175.06 → 1189.16] Your promise never fails me. And my desire is to follow you forever.
[1190.22 → 1198.56] For you are good. For you are good. For you are good to me.
[1198.56 → 1214.36] For you are good. For you are good. For you are good to me.
[1214.38 → 1226.22] For you are good. For you are good. For you are good to me.
[1228.56 → 1239.54] It is our privilege this morning to administer the sacrament of baptism to one of our little
[1239.54 → 1241.88] children, Anna Kleingelting.
[1242.50 → 1247.24] Now, we do not believe that there is anything magical about the water that we apply to the
[1247.24 → 1247.54] child.
[1247.64 → 1251.62] The water does not wash away original sin or save the child, right?
[1251.62 → 1256.00] Only Jesus' life, death, and resurrection does that.
[1256.00 → 1263.76] We believe that this child, as beautiful as she is, is sinful by nature and that the promises
[1263.76 → 1268.34] of God for forgiveness and life in the Holy Spirit are offered to her.
[1269.16 → 1274.74] We baptize infants not out of superstition or tradition or because we like really cute babies
[1274.74 → 1275.24] and kids.
[1275.50 → 1281.88] We baptize infants because they are covenant children and therefore should receive the sign
[1281.88 → 1283.10] of the covenant.
[1283.10 → 1287.70] In Genesis 15, God made a covenant with Abraham.
[1288.42 → 1292.20] The covenant was sealed with the sign of circumcision in Genesis 17.
[1293.06 → 1294.96] God promised to bless Abraham.
[1295.98 → 1300.48] For Abraham, this meant two things, offspring and land.
[1301.54 → 1307.44] That the heart of the covenant was God's promise that he would be a God to Abraham and his children.
[1307.44 → 1315.70] So God cut a covenant into Israel's flesh, carving out a people for himself, and they would be
[1315.70 → 1318.36] a light home for all of humanity.
[1319.36 → 1325.40] In the fullness of time, God sent his son, Jesus, to be our saviour.
[1325.40 → 1330.56] And in his death on the cross, our old self is dead and buried.
[1330.72 → 1338.04] And in his resurrection, we are rising again to new life and look forward now to his ultimate
[1338.04 → 1339.72] and glorious new creation.
[1340.72 → 1341.76] We are baptized.
[1342.24 → 1347.28] And when we are baptized in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, the
[1347.28 → 1350.56] triune God seals our adoption as his children.
[1351.10 → 1358.70] And he writes his name invisibly on our forehead, saying, you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood,
[1358.76 → 1361.70] a holy nation, a people belonging to God.
[1362.40 → 1366.68] Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God.
[1366.68 → 1372.12] By baptism, we have a new identity in Jesus Christ.
[1373.36 → 1377.14] And so, we come to administer the sacrament of baptism.
[1378.38 → 1385.04] We do so to Anna today with the weight of church history to encourage us and the example of redemptive
[1385.04 → 1387.24] history to confirm our practice.
[1388.34 → 1390.96] We baptize in obedience to Christ's command.
[1390.96 → 1397.52] The sacrament that we are about to administer is a sign of inclusion in the covenant community
[1397.52 → 1398.70] as circumcision was.
[1399.14 → 1404.34] And the water that we are about to pour is a sign of cleansing from sin as the sprinkled
[1404.34 → 1407.00] blood of bulls and goats in the Old Testament was.
[1407.96 → 1413.82] We pray that Anna will take advantage of all her covenant privileges, that she will acknowledge
[1413.82 → 1418.88] her Lord all the days of her life and by faith make these promises her own.
[1418.88 → 1426.16] Nathan and Maria, since you have presented Anna for baptism, I'm going to ask you the following
[1426.16 → 1432.16] questions before God and before his people gathered here and present with us on screen.
[1434.56 → 1439.88] Nathan and Maria, do you believe that your children, those sinful by nature, are received
[1439.88 → 1444.40] by God in Christ as members of his covenant and therefore ought to be baptized?
[1444.40 → 1450.24] And do you promise, in reliance on the Holy Spirit and with the help of the Christian community,
[1450.24 → 1456.14] to do all in your power to instruct Anna and all your children in the Christian faith and
[1456.14 → 1460.00] lead them by your example into the life of Christian discipleship?
[1460.68 → 1461.40] What is your answer?
[1463.18 → 1463.70] Amen.
[1463.70 → 1469.58] Our Lord said, let the little children come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom
[1469.58 → 1471.24] of God belongs to such of these.
[1471.68 → 1475.60] And in ordinary times and circumstances, I would invite all the kids to the front.
[1475.78 → 1481.16] And so if you are participating at home in today's service, I want to invite you as kids
[1481.16 → 1485.90] to come as close to the TV or the computer screen or whatever you're watching and participating
[1485.90 → 1487.96] on as your parents will allow.
[1487.96 → 1492.42] Again, in ordinary times, I would do this in such a way that when I put it out of the
[1492.42 → 1493.60] water, you would get all wet.
[1493.80 → 1496.12] And so that's not going to happen through the TV.
[1497.02 → 1503.66] But know that we together as a body of believers, as a church, are one family.
[1504.10 → 1509.34] Today, we're blessed to welcome Anna, the covenant member of that family.
[1517.96 → 1526.72] Yes, other kids.
[1526.98 → 1527.44] That's right.
[1527.68 → 1528.60] Why don't you come on up?
[1528.98 → 1530.10] Thank you for the reminder.
[1543.10 → 1543.96] All right.
[1543.96 → 1548.28] Can you guys all see?
[1549.12 → 1549.42] Yeah?
[1549.60 → 1549.96] All right.
[1554.68 → 1559.00] Anna, Emily, Alicia, Klein-Getting.
[1559.16 → 1567.12] I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[1568.86 → 1569.30] Amen.
[1569.30 → 1569.40] Amen.
[1573.96 → 1593.80] As Anna has been baptized, we have an opportunity to also participate as a family of believers,
[1594.24 → 1598.10] family both here gathered and family church participating digitally.
[1598.10 → 1600.28] And so I'm going to ask you a question.
[1600.82 → 1606.24] And even if you're at home, I want to invite you to respond with, we do, God helping us,
[1606.34 → 1609.12] or we do, or however you choose to respond.
[1610.02 → 1615.38] And so, people of God gathered here today, do you promise to love, encourage, and support
[1615.38 → 1621.88] Nathan and Maria and Anna and Joel and Media and Marcus and Julia by teaching the gospel
[1621.88 → 1629.12] of God's love, by being an example of Christian faith and character, and by giving strong support
[1629.12 → 1633.00] to God's family in fellowship, in prayer, and in service?
[1633.18 → 1634.12] What is your answer?
[1637.24 → 1641.58] And in case you couldn't hear that on screen, they did say we do, and I trust you did at home
[1641.58 → 1642.64] as well.
[1642.64 → 1654.80] Anna, Emily, Alicia, the Lord bless you and keep you.
[1655.44 → 1658.52] The Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[1659.02 → 1663.06] The Lord turn his face toward you and give you peace.
[1663.82 → 1670.10] In this way, the Lord puts his name on Anna and makes her his own.
[1670.90 → 1671.22] Amen.
[1671.22 → 1671.36] Amen.
[1672.64 → 1675.40] I'm going to invite Ken to come forward as an elder of church.
[1675.70 → 1677.76] He's going to offer a prayer and share a gift.
[1678.72 → 1684.80] Well, before I lead you in a word of prayer, I want to say this is actually awesome.
[1685.14 → 1689.04] We haven't been able to do this in a long time and see and witness a baptism in a long
[1689.04 → 1692.18] time, so it's just wonderful to be able to be here.
[1692.36 → 1695.12] So let me lead you guys in a prayer of blessing.
[1696.18 → 1699.02] Father in heaven, Lord, we come to you this day.
[1699.02 → 1705.50] We thank you, and we praise your name for allowing this baptism to take place.
[1705.50 → 1707.50] Father, for allowing us to witness this.
[1708.30 → 1715.12] Father, we now pray that you will be with Anna and that you will bless her in the days,
[1715.24 → 1716.32] weeks, and years to come.
[1716.64 → 1722.86] Father, that you will give her a measure of your Holy Spirit, that she may grow in love
[1722.86 → 1725.32] and faith towards you each and every day.
[1726.40 → 1731.98] And Father, we pray also for her parents, Nathan and Maria, as they have been tasked with the
[1731.98 → 1736.08] duty of raising her in the fear and love of your name.
[1736.30 → 1742.62] Father, give them all that they are in need of as well, as she will grow up to become a
[1742.62 → 1746.18] member and a servant of yours.
[1746.18 → 1752.92] Father, we pray also for the rest of the community of Emmanuel, that we too will be a hand and foot
[1752.92 → 1760.78] to Anna as she walks her faith in the church, in her church community.
[1761.82 → 1764.38] Father, we praise you for this time.
[1765.14 → 1769.76] And we also thank you for the other recent births in our congregation.
[1769.76 → 1775.18] We pray that in the near future, we may witness those baptisms as well.
[1776.02 → 1779.16] And Father, in the meantime, we pray that you will be with those children and their mothers.
[1779.38 → 1781.64] And Father, you will give them all that they are in need of.
[1782.42 → 1788.16] We thank you that through this baptism, we see your faithfulness to the generations.
[1788.58 → 1793.50] And Father, we also know that through the death and resurrection of our Lord and Saviour,
[1793.64 → 1796.20] Jesus Christ, you show your deep love for us all.
[1796.56 → 1798.08] And it is in his name we pray.
[1798.08 → 1798.66] Amen.
[1799.76 → 1805.14] And we have just a small gift for you here, just a congratulation.
[1805.14 → 1807.48] So I suppose, do you want to take it?
[1808.28 → 1808.60] Yeah?
[1809.06 → 1809.94] There we go.
[1810.82 → 1811.30] Awesome.
[1811.46 → 1812.26] So congratulations.
[1812.26 → 1824.62] Seth and I had the privilege of leading yesterday, the family in a song,
[1824.82 → 1828.06] and their selection was how deep the Father's love for us.
[1828.58 → 1833.80] And we would love to sing that together as a church family in recognition of this baptism.
[1833.80 → 1835.30] I'm going to sing that together as a.
[1835.30 → 1846.60] Amen.
[1846.60 → 1865.02] How deep the Father's love for us
[1865.02 → 1870.22] How vast beyond all measure
[1870.22 → 1877.72] That He should give His only Son
[1877.72 → 1883.26] To make a wretch His treasure
[1883.26 → 1890.56] How deep the pain of searing loss
[1890.56 → 1896.88] The Father turns His face away
[1896.88 → 1903.20] As wounds which for the chosen one
[1903.20 → 1908.88] Bring many sons to glory
[1908.88 → 1925.88] Behold the manna upon the cross
[1925.88 → 1932.20] My sin upon His shoulders
[1932.20 → 1938.88] Ashamed I hear my knocking doors
[1939.56 → 1946.08] Call out among the sorrows
[1946.08 → 1952.40] It was not sinned that held Him bare
[1952.40 → 1958.08] Until it was accomplished
[1958.08 → 1965.40] His dying breath has brought me by
[1965.40 → 1971.72] I know that it is in Him
[1971.72 → 1988.04] I will not boast in anything
[1988.04 → 1994.36] No gifts, no power, no wisdom
[1994.36 → 2002.68] But I will boast in Jesus Christ
[2002.68 → 2007.68] His death and resurrection
[2007.68 → 2014.00] Why should I gain from His reward
[2014.00 → 2020.32] I cannot give an answer
[2020.32 → 2026.64] But this I know in all my heart
[2026.64 → 2032.96] His wounds have made my ransom
[2032.96 → 2039.28] His wounds have made my ransom
[2039.28 → 2047.60] His wounds have made my ransom
[2047.60 → 2053.92] But this I know in all my heart
[2053.92 → 2055.92] His wounds have made my ransom
[2055.92 → 2064.24] His wounds are made my ransom
[2064.24 → 2066.24] I know in all my heart
[2066.24 → 2068.56] My heart is made my ransom
[2068.56 → 2070.56] And I know that it is in Him
[2070.56 → 2072.56] I know that it is in Him
[2072.56 → 2074.56] But this is the truth
[2074.56 → 2076.56] I know that it is in Him
[2076.56 → 2078.56] And I know that it is in Him

[2108.56 → 2118.52] Hi kids! Hey, it's so good to see you. It's been such a long time, and I'm so glad to see you,
[2118.52 → 2124.32] even if it's on a screen, but that's okay. And first, what we're going to do is do our
[2124.32 → 2128.88] memory verse, and we have Ruby to do that for us. So here's Ruby.
[2128.88 → 2141.04] For God so loved the world he gave his one and only that whoever believes in him. So not perish,
[2142.00 → 2145.52] but have eternal life. John 3 16.
[2149.68 → 2155.20] So first, to come up a little closer to the screen so you can see a little bit better
[2155.20 → 2163.36] and then you can see what's going on. Okay? Now we've missed each other a long time and also
[2163.36 → 2174.56] I think you've probably missed Tammy! There's Tammy! Hi Tammy! Oh, Tammy! I'm so glad to see you. Oh,
[2174.56 → 2180.64] and he's so glad to see you too. Yes, do you remember what Tammy would do? He'd go around and
[2180.64 → 2188.00] give everybody a hug and give everybody a hug and if they want to do a tickle, and he can't do that now,
[2188.00 → 2196.40] but you know what? I get a hug. And a tickle. Oh, oh oh oh oh! Oh, dear! Oh, Tammy! Okay. Hey Tammy,
[2196.40 → 2205.92] I see that you brought something today. Oh, she wants to show it. Oh, that's beautiful. It's a coat.
[2206.56 → 2214.88] that's a beautiful coat it's a coat that's very colourful oh Jamie where did you get that from
[2216.00 → 2223.60] oh Jamie said that his mummy made it, and he's very proud of it so he's going to put it on let's see
[2224.16 → 2233.52] okay Jamie's going to put this colourful coat on oh, oh he's so happy oh he said his mom made it and
[2233.52 → 2243.92] he feels very special he's he's oh he even said he said that his mom thinks he thinks his mom loves
[2243.92 → 2250.56] him the best because she made a special coat oh you know what Jamie it's very similar to what the
[2250.56 → 2258.56] story is about today, and we're going to read it today in a story bible but first our story
[2258.56 → 2272.16] is from the bible let's all sing that little song together okay the b-i-b-l-e yes that's the book for
[2272.16 → 2286.32] me I stand alone on the word of god the b-i-b-l-e very good that's an easy song to remember I think a lot of
[2286.32 → 2291.28] you remember it so now we're going to go to our story you want to listen to the story too
[2292.08 → 2298.24] Jamie does too and so maybe you can all come a little closer and see that see some of the um
[2298.24 → 2304.64] pictures okay maybe you'll even remember this book that I would sometimes read with you
[2305.68 → 2314.00] okay and I wonder if you remember now know what kind of story it's going to be because Jamie was
[2314.00 → 2327.44] wearing a colourful coat who do you think it's going to be voted Joseph good job okay, so there is the
[2327.44 → 2336.08] picture see he's a young boy just that maybe a little bit older than some of you but probably maybe
[2336.08 → 2348.00] about 10 or 12. anyway here he is Joseph Jacob had 12 sons, but he loved his son Joseph the best
[2349.04 → 2359.12] Jacob gave Joseph a special coat his brothers were jealous and hated Joseph oh dear they do not look very happy
[2359.12 → 2370.88] happy one night Joseph dreamed that his father and brothers bowed down to him oh he's still wearing this colourful coat
[2375.76 → 2385.04] Joseph told his family about his dream his father was angry his brothers laughed they would never bow down to Joseph
[2385.04 → 2389.52] Joseph oh they don't look too happy do they
[2392.08 → 2399.44] Joseph's brothers looked after sheep one day Joseph went out to his fields to see his brothers
[2399.44 → 2404.40] they saw him coming oh he's still wearing his colourful coat
[2404.40 → 2414.16] they jumped on Joseph, and they took him took off his coat they threw him into a deep pit
[2415.76 → 2417.04] that looks pretty scary
[2423.76 → 2430.24] then the brothers sold Joseph to some strangers they took Joseph to the land of Egypt
[2430.24 → 2440.88] and he's all tied up, and they're going to take him they won't see him again then the brothers took
[2440.88 → 2450.64] Joseph's coat to their father Jacob he thought that an animal had eaten Joseph he was very sad
[2450.64 → 2457.68] and his mom is sad, and his mom is sad and Joseph was gone far away
[2459.84 → 2468.96] later Joseph became the ruler of Egypt one year there was no rain and no food but Joseph had saved food
[2468.96 → 2483.60] for Egypt that's where the pyramids are far away Joseph's brothers came to Egypt for food they didn't
[2483.60 → 2491.20] know that the ruler was their brother Joseph's brothers asked the ruler for food, and they bowed down
[2491.20 → 2504.64] just like Joseph said in the dream Joseph said I am your brother I love you I forgive you for selling me
[2506.24 → 2514.72] oh that's after many years of not seeing his family Joseph told his brothers go home and bring
[2514.72 → 2528.64] back my father Jacob was happy to see his son Joseph was a good ruler he was a good son, and he forgave his
[2528.64 → 2541.28] brothers oh isn't that a good story I think so in that story we learn a lot of things that's why god gave
[2541.28 → 2549.04] us the bible stories because in that bible story we can learn about forgiveness, and we can learn about
[2549.76 → 2555.12] how god cares for us even though we're a long but I haven't seen each other for a long, long time
[2556.00 → 2563.68] and what else is there can you think of some other things that you can learn from that story maybe about
[2563.68 → 2574.24] being about forgiving maybe about maybe not boasting but most of all I hope that you know that god loves
[2574.24 → 2583.60] you and god forgives you and me and everyone who asks for forgiveness isn't that a nice story then yes
[2584.40 → 2590.80] old man he said he doesn't think that he's very special he's special but also his brothers and sisters to
[2590.80 → 2601.12] his mom and he won't boast about getting a special coat okay so maybe now we should pray that's a good
[2601.12 → 2612.24] idea let's talk to god dear father we thank you so much that you love us so much and that you forgive us
[2612.24 → 2620.64] whenever we say we're sorry lord we thank you that we are your children and that we pray that we soon
[2620.64 → 2628.72] they'll be back together again all together here in this church as a family thank you god amen

[3086.48 → 3092.40] everything they are in need of father we again thank you for the baptism that we were able to witness

[3121.20 → 3127.04] Chris as he brings us your word let him speak clearly boldly and truthfully about the good news of Jesus
[3128.08 → 3132.88] father we bring all this before you not because we deserve any of it but because you have loved us first
[3133.52 → 3141.20] and sent our lord and saviour Jesus Christ to die on the cross for our sins it is in his name that we pray amen
[3141.20 → 3155.68] before I begin with uh our text this morning I need to do a bit of a mea culpa
[3157.20 → 3163.76] and so last week if you were part of our worship service as I was preaching there I came to a point
[3163.76 → 3168.96] where I was talking about my daughter in school and I said she was three years old instead of in grade
[3168.96 → 3176.40] three uh well I went home after service uh and I walked into the door and Nora shouts at me dad you
[3176.40 → 3184.24] said I was three years old so I promised her that I would apologize and I believe that public sin requires
[3184.24 → 3191.36] public confession and so the scope of my offence means the scope of my apology also has to be here
[3191.36 → 3197.60] in front of you and so Nora if you are listening or since you are listening I'm sorry
[3200.96 → 3207.92] we're going to read together from jams 4 continuing in our reading through the book of jams, and we're
[3207.92 → 3214.32] going to read verse 13 to 17 together and so if you've got a bible I invite you to open that up
[3214.32 → 3224.24] or have that in hand there with you as we go through together jams 4 13 17
[3226.72 → 3234.40] now listen you who say today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city spends a year there carry on
[3234.40 → 3242.48] business and make money why you do not even know what will happen tomorrow what is your life
[3242.48 → 3251.36] you are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes instead you ought to say if it is
[3251.36 → 3259.76] the lord's will we will live and do this or that as it is you boast in your arrogant schemes and all such
[3259.76 → 3271.04] boasting is evil anyone knows the good they ought to do and doesn't do if it is sin for them this is the word of the lord
[3272.48 → 3295.62] for
[3295.62 → 3301.94] years, we try to get away for a week, just the two of us, to someplace for a vacation. One year,
[3302.04 → 3307.10] we went to Boston. We've been to Montreal and to the mountains of Vermont. One year, we went to
[3307.10 → 3314.30] Florida together. This was the year that was going to be Washington, D.C. And we had it all planned
[3314.30 → 3318.34] out. We knew which Smithsonian museums we were going to go to, which memorials we were going to
[3318.34 → 3323.16] visit, the historic buildings and the government centres. We had designs on visiting the Hoover
[3323.16 → 3328.16] building, right, which is the FBI headquarters. We were going to visit the CIA headquarters in Langley.
[3328.26 → 3333.86] We were going to go to Arlington and visit the Washington National Cathedral. And the trip was
[3333.86 → 3339.62] scheduled for spring so that we could be there right in the middle of the National Cherry Blossom
[3339.62 → 3344.30] Festival, which is supposed to be one of the most beautiful times to visit Washington, D.C.
[3344.30 → 3354.72] We made all of those plans, then COVID hit. We made all of those plans, and then a global pandemic
[3354.72 → 3363.72] shut borders and changed all of our lives. And I recognize that after over a year of this together,
[3363.86 → 3369.44] right, a cancelled trip pales in comparison to what certain others have lost in the midst of this,
[3369.44 → 3375.12] who certain others have lost. And in contrast to the heartbreak and the loss of life, I will gladly
[3375.12 → 3381.22] give up that trip over and over again. But my point this morning, for our focus and attention,
[3381.52 → 3388.70] is that we make all sorts of plans. We detail them as precisely as possible. We have itemized
[3388.70 → 3395.18] itineraries, or at least a person in my family, I won't say who, has itemized itineraries. It's not me.
[3395.18 → 3404.26] We figure it out, and we figure out when we'll get there. But the presumption, of course, is that
[3404.26 → 3413.30] we'll get there. Now, this morning, James reminds us who is really in control. And James reminds us
[3413.30 → 3421.08] to make plans, but in a phrase, to hold them loosely, right? James wants us to see that the sovereignty of
[3421.08 → 3428.64] God calls forth an active humility on our part. Or as I'm going to say over and over again this morning,
[3428.74 → 3434.50] the sovereignty of God requires an active, responsive humility in us.
[3436.76 → 3442.98] Now, if you've been in the CRC, the Christian Reformed Church, for a while, or even more generally,
[3443.12 → 3448.36] the broader Reformed tradition has been pretty good at this. You might remember a time when,
[3448.36 → 3454.92] whenever plans were made or dates were published in the bulletin, right, two little letters would be
[3454.92 → 3461.46] put in brackets behind the events or the date, right? You would see the letters DV, right? So,
[3461.54 → 3470.76] for instance, on October 13, 1979, DV, the wedding of this or that person, will take place, right?
[3470.76 → 3478.10] Next Sunday, DV, we will celebrate the baptism of, do any of you remember that? How many of you
[3478.10 → 3485.66] remember what that means? Now, there's an old joke, and in your best Dutch accent, which I don't have,
[3485.72 → 3491.00] and I'm not going to do, because we're not a Dutch church anymore, but it says, DV means the Lord,
[3491.00 → 3492.56] the Lord willing.
[3495.06 → 3503.36] But that's right, DV means the Lord willing. It's Latin, and it's Do Valente. Do Valente,
[3503.36 → 3509.18] that's the title of this message. Do Valente, the Lord willing, these people will be married. Do
[3509.18 → 3515.02] Valente, the Lord willing, these people will make a public profession of faith. And it is this little
[3515.02 → 3523.02] phrase, DV, Do Valente, that is intended to convey the truth that James is trying to convey here in our
[3523.02 → 3530.14] text. You don't even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a
[3530.14 → 3537.80] little while and then vanishes. Instead, you ought to say, if it is the Lord's will, we will live and do this
[3537.80 → 3545.94] or that. If it is the Lord's will, Do Valente, if God ordains it, if God permits it, if God makes it happen,
[3545.94 → 3556.44] we will live and do this or that. So you see, the problem is not in the planning in and of itself.
[3556.44 → 3564.76] The problem is in planning in such a way that God has no place in the plans. The sovereignty of God
[3564.76 → 3576.06] requires an active, responsive humility in us. Now, I get that I'm using a word here, not just the
[3576.06 → 3582.36] Latin, but using a word that we may not be really familiar with. It's a theological term. The term is
[3582.36 → 3589.14] sovereignty, right? What is sovereignty? What is the sovereignty of God? And I know that this is doctrine
[3589.14 → 3595.92] talk, and some of you, when I do doctrine talk, your eyes sort of glass over, and you're thinking, man, this is
[3595.92 → 3601.70] the letter of James. James is supposed to be the practical guy. Why do we need to have doctrine talk? And in
[3601.70 → 3608.54] some sense, you're right. James is the practical guy, right? Faith without deeds is dead. And so that's true.
[3608.54 → 3616.02] But if James is the practical guy, and he's talking doctrine, maybe your conclusion ought to be that
[3616.02 → 3624.16] good doctrine is practical. Good doctrine will impact your life and how you live it. And I want to suggest
[3624.16 → 3633.84] that the doctrine of the sovereignty of God is exactly an example of this. Now, in a word, or in the word
[3633.84 → 3641.50] sovereignty, you will hear the root sovereign, right? A sovereign is a king or a queen, a ruler.
[3642.44 → 3651.22] And sovereignty, sovereignty is the exercise of his or her rule. So the sovereignty of God is the exercise
[3651.22 → 3658.16] of his rule. That's a simple enough operating definition. God is sovereign over all the earth.
[3658.16 → 3665.82] He rules it, and he wills it into his being by his word. And he continues its being by his ongoing word.
[3666.90 → 3678.28] All that is, is because God says, be. His rule is supreme and ultimate and his rule is authoritative.
[3678.84 → 3685.34] He is in control. Time is in his hands. Your days are in his hands. The sun, the moon, and the stars
[3685.34 → 3693.08] are in his hands. The earth spins on its axes because he wills it to spin such. Gravity is gravity because
[3693.08 → 3701.28] he pulls things down. Let me be clear. This is not a theological statement about reality. This is a real
[3701.28 → 3707.62] statement about ontology, right? Without God, nothing is. That's sovereignty.
[3707.62 → 3714.96] Now, I want to be really clear. Because sometimes we hear that, and we make the mistake
[3714.96 → 3722.84] of believing that the sovereignty of God, then, means some sort of determinism or fatalism, right?
[3722.88 → 3730.00] The sovereignty of God isn't about a passive fatalism, but instead it requires from us a humble
[3730.00 → 3735.04] dependence. The sovereignty of God requires an active, responsive humility.
[3735.04 → 3744.16] Do Valente isn't some sort of caveated excuse to not do something, right? I've heard people say,
[3744.30 → 3750.80] I've sat in council rooms in churches and heard people say, if it's God's will, it will happen.
[3751.04 → 3755.94] If it's not God's will, it won't happen. And then that's an argument to just sit there and not do
[3755.94 → 3761.52] anything, right? We just sit passively on our butts waiting for whatever to happen,
[3761.52 → 3766.08] and we think that's what it means to live into sovereignty. But then nothing gets done,
[3766.20 → 3772.92] nothing changes, nothing happens. And then, I've seen this too, somehow, after saying that or doing
[3772.92 → 3778.94] that or being that way, we have the audacity to blame God or to get mad at him for not giving us
[3778.94 → 3784.36] the thing that we wanted or the thing that we were waiting for. Instead, properly understood,
[3784.36 → 3792.48] sovereignty and God's sovereignty comes to you and says, do something. And now, here it is, right? Do it
[3792.48 → 3801.64] with the mindset, with the humility that says, I need the grace of God, right? I am dependent on the
[3801.64 → 3810.44] will of God for every aspect of my life and faith. Whatever you do, do it for the glory of God and do it
[3810.44 → 3815.62] with the humility that asks for God's care and his provision. Do it with the humility that says,
[3816.12 → 3820.84] not my will but yours be done. Do it with the humility that says, not a hair can fall from my
[3820.84 → 3826.94] head without the will of my Father in heaven. Because you see, over and over and over again in the Bible,
[3827.08 → 3835.04] there are two realities that we sometimes think exist in tension with each other. But the truth is,
[3835.04 → 3841.96] in God's sovereignty, these realities are not conflicting, but they are complementary, right?
[3842.00 → 3848.88] That they go together as one. I'm going to pull this together for you. So let's look a little bit
[3848.88 → 3855.44] more closely at God's sovereignty and what that is. Now, we've seen it already in the book of James,
[3856.16 → 3860.38] right? Remember, in chapter 1, verse 17, we read,
[3860.38 → 3865.78] Every good and perfect gift comes from above, coming down from the Father of heavenly lights,
[3866.08 → 3871.98] right? Everything you have, everything that happens, comes from God and by his will.
[3873.08 → 3876.18] In Colossians 1, verse 16 and 17, we read,
[3876.38 → 3883.08] For in him, or by him, all things were created. He is before all things, and in him all things hold
[3883.08 → 3893.32] together, right? All things hold and are held together by God. That's sovereignty. Or Proverbs 16,
[3893.44 → 3901.10] 33 says, The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the Lord. Right? Even what seems
[3901.10 → 3910.56] to our perspectives random, like thrown dice, comes from God's hand. That's sovereignty. Job 42,
[3910.56 → 3917.10] verse 2, right? After everything that Job went through, all of his losses, all the deaths in
[3917.10 → 3922.82] his family, losing all of his possessions, his hurts and his pains, everything that he experiences,
[3923.28 → 3931.64] Job still says at the end, I know that you, Lord, can do all things that no purpose of yours can be
[3931.64 → 3935.40] thwarted. That's the sovereignty of God.
[3935.40 → 3944.58] Lamentations 3, 37 and 38 says, Who can speak and have it happen if the Lord has not decreed it?
[3945.46 → 3951.52] Is it not from the mouth of the Lord that both calamities and good things come? Or Jeremiah 32,
[3951.64 → 3956.60] 17 says, O sovereign Lord, you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and
[3956.60 → 3965.12] outstretched arm? Nothing is too hard for you. And in all of these verses, in this quick, super quick
[3965.12 → 3970.60] survey, we haven't even touched on the verses about salvation being set before the foundation of the
[3970.60 → 3978.24] world or about God being the one who draws you to him or how being dead in sin, but Christ makes you
[3978.24 → 3984.70] alive in Christ, about God predestining you for his glory. But that's all there and that's all part of
[3984.70 → 3992.66] God's sovereignty. The truth of the Bible is that God is in control, absolutely. That nothing happens
[3992.66 → 3999.64] without his will and his word. That he is the ruler over all creation, the king whose will is his way,
[3999.74 → 4007.90] is the way. Like 2 Chronicles 20 verse 6 says, You rule over all the kingdoms of nations, power and
[4007.90 → 4015.70] might are in your hands. No one can withstand you. And that means that no one stands without God,
[4015.86 → 4025.68] no one out stands God, and no one stands with God. That is, there is none like him. He is sovereign.
[4025.68 → 4038.64] And there is a complementary truth in God's sovereignty. A complementary truth that you
[4038.64 → 4047.20] are called to work. You are called to do something. The sovereignty of God requires an active,
[4047.64 → 4055.64] responsive humility in us. Active and responsive. The whole book of James is about connecting,
[4055.68 → 4062.48] connecting your hearing, and you're doing, about making our faith real by obedience. Deeds of faith
[4062.48 → 4069.10] aren't contrary to faith, right? Deeds of faith aren't contrary to faith in God who provides.
[4069.20 → 4073.92] Instead, deeds of faith are marks that your faith is true and it's real.
[4077.12 → 4083.34] A couple of weeks ago, we looked at chapter 4, the first part of chapter 4. Pastor Kevin led us in that.
[4083.34 → 4089.92] And in verse 7, it says, Submit yourselves to God, right? That's humility language. That's language of
[4089.92 → 4095.90] God's sovereign rule and our humble response there. In verse 7, it says, Submit yourself to God,
[4096.56 → 4104.46] resist the devil. Now, that's do something language, right? Come near to God and he will come near to you.
[4104.86 → 4110.30] Wash your hands, purify your heart, he says in the first part of chapter 4, right? All of that is done
[4110.30 → 4119.36] something language. In 1st and 2nd Thessalonians, Paul warns the church against idleness, right? People
[4119.36 → 4125.34] who aren't doing anything, who are just riding out, right? He says to keep away from those who are idle
[4125.34 → 4132.06] and to warn them. He says, We hear some among you are idle and disruptive. They are not busy, they are busy
[4132.06 → 4141.60] bodies, right? In a very real way, we are created to do something, to work, right? All the way back in
[4141.60 → 4148.08] the creation story of Genesis 1 and 2, where God made all that is, right? God made Adam and Eve and
[4148.08 → 4154.90] he put them in a garden. And in Genesis 2, 15, it says that he put them in a garden to work it and keep it.
[4154.90 → 4162.90] To work it and keep it. Work, doing something, is part of being human. It's part of what God looked
[4162.90 → 4170.62] at the very beginning and said, This is very good. So doing something is not in contrast to God's
[4170.62 → 4176.50] sovereignty, where we say he does everything, that everything happens by his will. No, doing something
[4176.50 → 4183.82] complements God's sovereignty as God exercises his will through human action, human activity,
[4183.82 → 4194.22] and human history. Let me give you two examples where we can clearly see these two realities of
[4194.22 → 4201.70] God's sovereignty and human responsibility to be active in humility, where we see those two things
[4201.70 → 4208.78] wedded together. And in fact, Holy Spirit works in really marvellous ways, because I didn't talk to
[4208.78 → 4214.14] Wendy or Nikki beforehand, but one of those examples is the story of Joseph, right? Joseph,
[4214.46 → 4222.22] in that story, is left for dead, basically sold into slavery by his brothers. He goes through a
[4222.22 → 4227.54] version of living hell. Well, early on in Egypt, he's charged with false crimes. He ends up in jail.
[4227.64 → 4232.44] He's passed over again and again in a time in jail. Eventually, he gets out, yes, and eventually,
[4232.44 → 4238.88] he rises to power, but he had to go through some stuff in order to get there. And his brothers
[4238.88 → 4246.46] left him. His father thought he was dead. But the end of the story, when the two, when the brothers and
[4246.46 → 4251.58] Joseph, when his father is all reconciled, Joseph looks at his brothers, and he says,
[4252.04 → 4258.80] You intended to harm me. That's their action, their work in the world. But God intended it,
[4258.80 → 4265.42] right? Not God turned it, right? Not God came in after the fact and said, Oh, I will work it. God
[4265.42 → 4270.86] intended it. He purposed it from the very beginning, alongside of your purposes. He intended it
[4270.86 → 4276.74] for good, to accomplish the saving of many lives.
[4278.80 → 4286.66] Human activity and responsibility, complementary wedded to God's sovereignty. And of course,
[4286.66 → 4293.22] from the story of Joseph, there is a straight line directly to Jesus, who is the true and better
[4293.22 → 4299.64] Joseph, the true and better brother who was slain on our behalf. Jesus, who lived the life I should
[4299.64 → 4304.64] have lived. And then, though he was perfectly righteous, though in him there was no sin at all,
[4304.70 → 4310.48] he became sin, and he bore death on the cross, the death that I deserve, that you deserve, that we all
[4310.48 → 4322.22] deserve. He bore it on the cross, the wrath of God for sin. God took what the world intended to be the
[4322.22 → 4332.18] the greatest evil ever imaginable, the death of God's Son. He intended that for the saving of many lives.
[4332.18 → 4339.34] He intended that for the salvation of all who would believe. God's sovereignty and human action,
[4339.50 → 4346.02] complementary, wedded together. There's a second way that we see this really clearly.
[4347.18 → 4353.98] That's in Philippians 2. Philippians 2, verse 12 and 13, Paul writes there,
[4354.08 → 4358.58] Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed, and again, train your ears to hear that,
[4358.58 → 4363.60] right? That's do something language. As you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now
[4363.60 → 4371.16] much more in my absence, continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling, right? Work out
[4371.16 → 4377.48] your salvation. Do the work. Be disciplined in devotion. Exercise your faith. Strengthen your
[4377.48 → 4383.22] obedience. Run with perseverance the race marked out for you, like in the Garden of Eden. Work it and
[4383.22 → 4389.92] keep it. Cultivate your faith. Grow it. Shape it. Be pruned by God in the Holy Spirit and produce fruits.
[4390.30 → 4396.72] Do the work. Continue to work out your salvation with fear and with trembling, for it is God who
[4396.72 → 4404.60] works in you. Paul continues. You hear that? Continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling.
[4404.60 → 4414.38] Do the work. God's sovereignty requires an active, responsive humility, for it is God who works in you
[4414.38 → 4423.04] to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purposes. In theological terms, again, this is a
[4423.04 → 4429.70] modernism that calls you out to do the work and to make it real. The sovereignty of God requires an active,
[4429.70 → 4438.10] responsive humility in us. And in our worship this morning, in the illustrations we've mentioned here
[4438.10 → 4446.36] in the letter from James, there is perhaps no greater example of this, no greater sign or symbol of this
[4446.36 → 4455.08] than baptism itself. Baptism is a perfect example of what we are talking about here because in baptism,
[4455.08 → 4462.70] we acknowledge and see God at work. We baptize infants in our tradition and church community
[4462.70 → 4468.00] not because we are doing something, not because we are making promises or dedications, not because
[4468.00 → 4471.98] we are committing to be a certain way, even though we do those things. And that's part of our liturgy.
[4472.42 → 4480.60] We baptize children and infants. We baptize Anna because God makes a promise. Because God is at work.
[4480.60 → 4490.16] All right, faith is a gift. And the promised fruit of that faith, the promised reality of the forgiveness
[4490.16 → 4497.72] of sins is extended to Anna by God, by virtue of being her, by her being a member of our covenant
[4497.72 → 4506.16] family. Inclusion in this covenant family is a gift of God. It is an exercise of God's sovereign rule
[4506.16 → 4516.12] in the world. But we respond to God's work. We promise to support and to love. We promise to
[4516.12 → 4521.78] pray for her and to shape her in the faith. We promise to teach her and to raise her. Furthermore, we promise
[4521.78 → 4528.18] to support Nathan and Maria and all the other kids. We promise to come alongside them. And in that promise,
[4528.18 → 4537.66] in that commitment to be active and responsive, God is at work in us and through us to her.
[4539.34 → 4547.48] We are the exercise of God's sovereignty in the life of Anna as faith is formed in her. And Lord willing,
[4548.32 → 4557.40] Do Valente, one day she will respond in faith. She will make it her own, and we will see God's sovereign
[4557.40 → 4565.36] will be extended and including her in it as she stands, Lord willing, again before us to make that profession
[4565.36 → 4580.18] of faith where she says, yes, you are my God. I am your child. The promise of God extended and made real
[4580.18 → 4587.38] in baptism is an example of the sovereignty of God at work and requiring from us an active
[4587.40 → 4597.30] and responsive humility. But the hope of the gospel, the gospel that sees God able to take the
[4597.30 → 4603.58] the greatest evils ever intended and turn them to the greatest good. The hope of the gospel that is able
[4603.58 → 4610.44] to see the story of Joseph and the reconciliation and the forgiveness and restoration that comes from
[4610.44 → 4616.28] that. The hope of the gospel that enables us to see God at work even in the midst of a global pandemic.
[4616.28 → 4623.96] The hope of the gospel is that we can see our sovereign God even when all else is crumbling
[4623.96 → 4629.18] around us. His rule is forever.
[4634.18 → 4638.72] Do Valente changes you.
[4638.72 → 4650.00] Do Valente speaking this recognition of God's active work in the world changes.
[4651.74 → 4659.46] No longer are you left alone or in fear. No longer are we left broken, but we are made whole.
[4659.46 → 4673.54] And so day and every day forward. Make plans. Work. Do something. Make your plans in the Lord.
[4675.94 → 4686.34] Make your plans in the hope, confidence, the conviction, even the certainty. God is sovereign.
[4686.34 → 4690.50] Amen. Amen. Let's pray together.
[4696.02 → 4697.68] Lord our God,
[4697.68 → 4703.74] as you speak your word of truth to us this morning,
[4704.62 → 4708.74] open our eyes to your rule in the world.
[4708.74 → 4716.06] open our hearts to your authority and your sovereign power over all the earth.
[4717.42 → 4718.98] And convict us.
[4720.08 → 4726.78] Convict us to go forward from this place in the power of your sovereign rule.
[4727.42 → 4733.36] That we might be the means by which you exercise that authority to the world.
[4733.36 → 4737.00] And God, we pray.
[4738.52 → 4739.20] A little Anna.
[4741.46 → 4742.36] The Klein-Geldings.
[4743.32 → 4746.14] That all of us together, each and every one,
