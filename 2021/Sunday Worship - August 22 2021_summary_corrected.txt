• The tendency to focus on earthly life and forget about eternity
• The question of why hell is rarely discussed in modern Christian culture
• The debate over whether hell is real, including various views among Christians (annihilationism, universalism, traditional view)
• Annihilationism: a view that those who don't believe in Jesus cease to exist and there is no hell or eternal suffering.
• Universalism: everyone goes to heaven regardless of their actions or beliefs, due to God's great grace.
• Traditional view of hell: if you reject the truth of Jesus as your saviour, you go to hell.
• The traditional view of hell is uncomfortable and may be wrong
• Francis Chan and Preston Sprinkle's book "Erasing Hell" argues against universalism and emphasizes the reality of hell as a place where God judges people at the end of their lives
• A judge's role is to weigh evidence objectively, reach impartial conclusions, and impose sentences equitably, which vindicates God's judgment rather than making Him seem vengeful
• God is the ultimate judge and not humans, who should not try to design new rubrics for judgment in a complex universe that they barely understand
• The reality of hell and heaven are real, but their exact nature is difficult to define
• Jesus speaks of hell frequently in the Gospels
• Examples include Matthew 11:23-24, where Jesus warns the city of Capernaum that it will be thrown into Hades (or Gehenna) due to its wickedness
• Gehenna is an actual place, a valley near Jerusalem where ancient kings sacrificed babies and later became a dump for burning garbage and dead animals
• Jesus uses Gehenna as a reference to describe hell in multiple places throughout the Gospels
• The concept of Gehenna and its symbolic representation in the Bible
• Jesus' use of Gehenna as a metaphor for hell
• Different interpretations of hell, including Dante's Inferno
• Dante's depiction of nine concentric circles of torment within the earth
• Other views of hell, such as Rabbi Him's parable about long utensils preventing self-service and C.S. Lewis' concept in The Great Divorce
• The speaker describes hell as a gray city with constant rain and gloom
• Hell is portrayed as a place of quarrelsome residents who fight constantly and cannot coexist
• Residents can create things by thinking about them, but they are poorly made and unsatisfying
• Hell is depicted in three different ways, but its true nature is unknown
• The absence of God in hell means hope is lost, love does not exist, and selfishness reigns
• Heaven is described as a place with no sea, where the holy city of new Jerusalem comes down from God
• Heaven is portrayed as a beautiful, peaceful place prepared by God for his people
• The throne of God is among the people
• There will be no more death, mourning, crying, or pain
• A river of water of life flows from the throne of God
• The tree of life bears twelve crops of fruit every month
• No curse will exist in heaven
• God's servants will serve him and see his face
• Light will not be needed in heaven because God will give light to those who dwell there
• Discussion of heaven and hell being infrequent in conversation
• Reasons why heaven and hell are not discussed often: 
  • Those who have put their faith in Jesus Christ as their saviour are already saved
  • Heaven is a concrete reality for them, eliminating the need to discuss it
• Second reason: discussing heaven and hell may not be necessary because Jesus has already accomplished salvation through his sinless life, death on the cross, and resurrection
• Using heaven and hell as motivators for conversion
• Critique of "turn or burn" sermons and tactics
• Problem with using fear as a means to convert unbelievers
• Distinction between morality and salvation through Jesus Christ
• Shift from emphasizing what people must do to gain salvation to focusing on what God has done
• The purpose of the mission is to share the saving power and love of Christ.
• Heaven and hell should not be used as motivators or gimmicks for good behaviour or evangelism.
• Faith in Christ and understanding his gospel message lead to salvation and a changed life.
• The Holy Spirit, not fear of hell or promise of heaven, changes lives.
• Once faith is established, eternity with the triune God becomes certain.
• Using heaven and hell as motivators can distract from the true nature of the gospel.
• Faith in Christ has already saved the world from the clutches of hell.
