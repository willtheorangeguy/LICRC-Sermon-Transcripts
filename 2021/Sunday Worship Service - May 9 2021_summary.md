• The ascension makes true and proper worship possible because God intervenes with his grace, seating Jesus on the throne of our hearts.
• The Holy Spirit facilitates this worship by quickening dead hearts and regenerating us, allowing us to direct our worship rightly to Jesus.

• The ascension of Jesus enables His presence in our hearts and also takes us out into the world as disciples making disciples

• The work of converting and saving the lost is God's work through the Holy Spirit, but believers are called to participate in this work
• Sharing one's love and joy for Jesus with others is essential and should be done with passion and energy
