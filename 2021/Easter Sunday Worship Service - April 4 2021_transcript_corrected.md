[0.00 → 17.00] There's a place where mercy rains and never dies.
[19.50 → 29.00] There's a place where streams of grace flow deep and wide.
[30.00 → 46.00] For all the love I've ever found comes like a flood, comes flowing down.
[46.00 → 56.00] At the cross, at the cross, I surrender my life.
[56.00 → 62.00] I'm in awe of you, I'm in awe of you.
[62.00 → 69.00] Where your love ran red, and my sin washed white.
[69.00 → 86.00] I owe all to you, I owe all to you, Jesus.
[86.00 → 99.00] There's a place where sin and shame are powerless.
[99.00 → 112.00] Where my heart has peace with God and forgiveness.
[112.00 → 114.00] There's a place where sin and grace will be.
[114.00 → 118.00] Where all the love I've ever found.
[118.00 → 125.00] Comes like a flood, comes flowing down.
[125.00 → 152.06] At the cross, at the cross, I surrender my life. I'm in awe of you. I'm in awe of you. Where your love ran away, in my sin washed white, I owe to you. I owe to you.
[152.06 → 178.56] Here my hope is found, here on holy ground, here I bow down, here I bow down. Here arms open wide, here you save my life, here I bow down, here I bow.
[178.56 → 200.56] At the cross, at the cross, I surrender my life. I'm in awe of you. I'm in awe of you. Where your love ran away, in my sin washed white, I owe to you.
[200.56 → 210.56] I owe to you. I owe to you. I owe to you.
[210.56 → 212.56] Jesus.
[212.56 → 214.56] Jesus.
[214.56 → 216.56] Jesus.
[216.56 → 218.56] Jesus.
[218.56 → 220.56] Saviour of the world.
[220.56 → 226.56] Your love ran away, your love ran away.
[226.56 → 228.56] You'vast been angry with me.
[228.56 → 230.56] His love ran away, your love ran away.
[230.56 → 232.56] His love ran away.
[232.56 → 237.82] He said he killed a baojai�� with me.
[237.82 → 238.32] When you die who Leon Sara made, they won't die.
[238.32 → 239.56] He said he deleted him speak.
[239.56 → 248.50] Remember your love ran away, he said he had seeks.
[248.50 → 250.56] He said he'd also have gone.
[250.56 → 252.14] Please follow me from breaking blocks.
[252.14 → 254.56] If there were not JUST any problems, I might want to parody.
[254.56 → 259.56] I was buried beneath my shame.
[263.26 → 268.26] Who could carry that kind of weight?
[271.12 → 277.12] It was my tool till I made you.
[277.12 → 285.12] I was breathing but not alive.
[288.12 → 294.12] All my failures I tried to hide.
[296.12 → 303.12] It was my tool till I made you.
[303.12 → 308.12] You called my name.
[309.12 → 312.12] And I ran out of that grave.
[314.12 → 317.12] Out of the darkness.
[318.12 → 320.12] To your glorious day.
[323.12 → 325.12] You called my name.
[325.12 → 329.12] And I ran out of that grave.
[331.12 → 334.12] Out of the darkness.
[335.12 → 337.12] To your glorious day.
[337.12 → 353.12] You called my name.
[354.12 → 358.12] Now your freedom is all that I know.
[358.12 → 360.12] That I know
[360.12 → 361.24] Listen
[361.24 → 364.66] The old made you
[364.66 → 369.24] Jesus when I met you
[369.24 → 373.92] When you called my name
[373.92 → 377.58] And I ran out of that grave
[377.58 → 382.46] Out of the darkness
[382.46 → 386.30] To your glorious day
[388.12 → 391.60] You called my name
[391.60 → 395.18] And I ran out of that grave
[395.18 → 400.02] Out of the darkness
[400.02 → 403.90] To your glorious day
[403.90 → 416.10] This is my story
[416.10 → 418.26] This is your story
[418.26 → 419.78] Come on, listen
[419.78 → 422.94] I needed rescue
[422.94 → 425.10] My sin was heavy
[425.10 → 426.84] But chains break
[426.84 → 429.00] At the way you're going
[429.00 → 431.46] I needed shelter
[431.46 → 433.68] I was an orphan
[433.68 → 438.08] Now you call me a citizen of heaven
[438.08 → 440.28] When I was broken
[440.28 → 442.48] You were my healing
[442.48 → 445.16] Now your love is healing
[445.16 → 446.78] I'm breathing
[446.78 → 448.94] I have a future
[448.94 → 451.22] My eyes are open
[451.22 → 454.04] Cause when you called my name
[454.04 → 458.40] I ran out of that grave
[458.40 → 463.16] Out of the darkness
[463.16 → 466.32] To your glorious day
[466.32 → 468.32] To your glorious day
[468.32 → 471.32] You called my name
[471.32 → 475.28] And I ran out of that grave
[475.28 → 480.32] Out of the darkness
[480.32 → 484.60] To your glorious day
[484.60 → 487.36] Oh, come on
[487.36 → 488.34] Hey
[488.34 → 489.76] Oh, what a day
[489.76 → 491.76] Oh, what a day
[491.76 → 507.76] Oh, what a day
[507.76 → 510.04] Oh, what a day
[510.04 → 513.78] You called my name
[513.78 → 516.48] I keep running out of that grave
[516.48 → 526.24] 2017, let's hear it
[526.24 → 527.98] The loudest shout you've got in you
[527.98 → 528.96] Give it to us
[528.96 → 558.94] Give it to us
[558.96 → 560.50] Let's say it together

[668.02 → 670.02] Now shout it out.
[670.02 → 672.02] To break every chain.
[672.02 → 674.02] To break every chain.
[674.02 → 676.02] Break every chain.
[676.02 → 677.02] Yeah.
[677.02 → 679.02] Break every chain.

[713.02 → 715.02] To break every chain.
[715.02 → 716.02] Hallelujah.
[716.02 → 718.02] Christ is risen.
[718.02 → 719.02] Hallelujah.
[719.02 → 720.02] Christ is risen indeed.
[720.02 → 722.02] The tomb is empty.
[722.02 → 723.02] Our hearts are full.
[723.02 → 728.02] Christ the Lord is risen today.
[728.02 → 730.02] Welcome to worship.
[730.02 → 731.02] On Easter Sunday.
[731.02 → 732.02] Which is one of my favourite Sundays of the year.
[732.02 → 747.02] We light a new Christ candle to remind us that the tomb is empty.
[747.02 → 751.02] That the light of the world has come back from death.
[751.02 → 756.02] And now lights our life in the world.
[756.02 → 766.02] And I want to begin this morning just by acknowledging that for many of us, maybe even most of us, this isn't the Easter Sunday we wanted.
[766.02 → 769.02] This isn't how we wanted to experience our worship together.
[769.02 → 775.02] This isn't how we wanted to experience our family, perhaps later in the service, or our brothers and sisters in Christ together.
[775.02 → 781.02] This just isn't the way we had hoped to celebrate our Easter.
[781.02 → 790.02] And yet, even in the midst of all of that, the tomb is empty and Christ is victorious.
[790.02 → 796.02] And so today, maybe as you worship at home, you haven't sung as loud as you would if you were here.
[796.02 → 800.02] Maybe you haven't participated in the singing at all today.
[800.02 → 805.02] I want to encourage you just to sing out.
[805.02 → 812.02] To sing out and to sing in Easter Sunday in a way that we would do if we were all together.
[812.02 → 822.02] Because the truth is, even in this way, we are together, and can worship our God because He is risen.
[822.02 → 826.02] Let's sing to our risen Saviour today.
[826.02 → 828.28] .
[828.28 → 832.84] doctor
[838.84 → 850.84] so
[850.84 → 861.12] I will have the risen King who decides to bring Him praise
[861.12 → 869.44] From all into your hearts to sing to the morning star of grace
[869.44 → 877.74] From the shifting shadows of the earth we will lift our eyes to Him
[877.74 → 885.50] Where steady arms of mercy reach to gather children
[885.50 → 895.24] Rejoice, rejoice, let every tongue rejoice
[895.24 → 903.12] One heart, one voice, O Church of Christ return
[907.74 → 914.94] When the mercy's joy is morning sun
[914.94 → 919.00] And those weeping through the night
[919.00 → 923.80] On the close to tell of battles won
[923.80 → 927.84] And those struggling in the right
[927.84 → 932.68] For His perfect love will never change
[932.68 → 936.78] And His mercies never cease
[936.78 → 941.66] God follow us through all our days
[941.66 → 945.54] With the certain hope of peace
[945.54 → 953.88] Rejoice, rejoice, let every tongue rejoice
[953.88 → 958.88] One heart, one voice
[958.88 → 962.88] O Church of Christ return
[962.88 → 975.32] Come, John, and all from every land
[975.32 → 979.26] Men and women of the faith
[979.26 → 984.38] Come, those with bold or empty hands
[984.38 → 988.54] Come, the riches of His grace
[988.54 → 993.34] Over all the world His people sing
[993.34 → 997.18] Toward the shore we hear them call
[997.18 → 1002.40] The truth that cries through every hate
[1002.40 → 1006.40] Our God is all in all
[1006.40 → 1014.54] Rejoice, rejoice, let every tongue rejoice
[1014.54 → 1019.74] One heart, one voice
[1019.74 → 1023.40] O Church of Christ rejoice
[1023.40 → 1028.70] Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice
[1028.70 → 1033.14] Let every tongue rejoice
[1033.14 → 1037.94] One heart, one voice
[1037.94 → 1040.94] O Church of Christ rejoice
[1040.94 → 1061.02] Again, I want to thank you for joining with us this morning in worship.
[1061.14 → 1061.66] My name is Chris.
[1061.82 → 1063.66] I'm pastor here at Langley Emanuel.
[1063.78 → 1066.86] And I want to especially welcome those of you who are joining,
[1066.98 → 1067.94] maybe for the first time.
[1067.94 → 1071.56] It's Easter Sunday, and so you are looking for a service or a way to participate.
[1072.12 → 1076.60] We're so excited that even in this way, you can be here with us.
[1077.56 → 1083.22] Throughout the week, if you're looking to connect with myself or another pastor or some staff members here at church,
[1083.30 → 1085.26] you can give us a call, come on by.
[1085.38 → 1088.84] You can find us online and find different ways to connect there.
[1089.24 → 1093.82] We really do encourage you, please, if you are looking for prayer or a connection,
[1093.82 → 1097.74] call one of us, and we will gladly meet with you.
[1098.44 → 1107.00] We gather together to worship our God because Jesus Christ is risen and by his spirit he is in this place.
[1107.10 → 1111.86] And so I invite you to open your heart, maybe your hands, to receive the greeting of our God.
[1111.86 → 1118.30] Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father,
[1118.92 → 1122.74] from the risen Saviour Jesus Christ our Lord,
[1123.38 → 1126.54] in the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[1127.86 → 1128.24] Amen.
[1128.24 → 1135.34] Our call to worship today is based on Psalm 118.
[1136.34 → 1139.54] This is the day that the Lord has made.
[1140.14 → 1142.96] Let us rejoice and be glad in it.
[1143.72 → 1146.16] Come, give thanks to our God.
[1146.76 → 1149.22] His steadfast love endures forever.
[1150.02 → 1152.66] He is our strength and our salvation.
[1152.66 → 1157.08] Because of his love, his death, and resurrection,
[1157.72 → 1160.62] we too can have an eternal life with him.
[1161.46 → 1162.74] Today we celebrate,
[1163.36 → 1164.90] Jesus is not dead.
[1165.38 → 1166.42] He is alive.
[1167.04 → 1168.08] And he is risen.
[1168.58 → 1170.18] He is risen indeed.
[1182.66 → 1194.70] Christ the Lord is risen today.

[1410.42 → 1413.42] in Jesus Christ.
[1413.42 → 1414.42] He is not dead.
[1414.42 → 1415.42] He is alive.
[1415.42 → 1417.42] We have this hope in Jesus Christ.
[1417.42 → 1419.42] He is alive.
[1419.42 → 1420.42] He is alive.
[1420.42 → 1421.42] He is alive.
[1421.42 → 1422.42] He is alive.
[1422.42 → 1423.42] He is alive.
[1423.42 → 1424.42] He is alive.
[1424.42 → 1426.42] We have this hope in Jesus Christ.
[1426.42 → 1428.42] We have this hope in Jesus Christ.
[1428.42 → 1429.42] Christ the Lord is risen today.
[1429.42 → 1430.42] Alleluia.
[1430.42 → 1431.42] Hallelujah.
[1433.42 → 1434.42] Alleluia.
[1434.42 → 1435.42] Alleluia.
[1437.42 → 1438.42] Let's pray together.
[1438.42 → 1440.52] risen today.
[1445.16 → 1446.04] Alleluia.
[1450.38 → 1451.66] Let's pray together.
[1455.18 → 1458.06] Lord, we come to you this Easter morning
[1458.06 → 1461.56] praying that our celebration
[1461.56 → 1465.38] of your resurrection will bring new hope
[1465.38 → 1466.38] to us today.
[1466.38 → 1470.44] We pray for our forgiveness of our sinfulness.
[1471.52 → 1474.96] May the empty tomb help us to leave our guilt
[1474.96 → 1477.52] and our sorrows at the foot of the cross.
[1478.86 → 1481.32] May your victory over death be ours
[1481.32 → 1484.00] as we turn our eyes and our hearts
[1484.00 → 1486.62] to the promises of heaven.
[1487.98 → 1490.88] May the hope we have in you and your forgiveness
[1490.88 → 1493.66] reign in us, in our lives, forever.
[1493.66 → 1496.60] In your name alone we pray.
[1497.50 → 1497.80] Amen.
[1497.80 → 1497.90] Amen.
[1497.90 → 1500.94] For our children and our lives,
[1500.94 → 1501.70] let us know your destiny.
[1501.70 → 1502.10] Amen.
[1502.10 → 1503.32] Amen.
[1503.32 → 1504.30] Man's slave is always one person
[1504.30 → 1506.18] for us to wait our lives
[1506.18 → 1507.34] in our lives, literally per securing
[1507.34 → 1507.68] for us to love our God.
[1507.68 → 1508.34] He name is only one person
[1508.34 → 1508.78] for God.
[1508.78 → 1508.88] Amen.
[1508.88 → 1510.82] Great.
[1510.82 → 1534.12] When a star rose, Lamb of God, by his own betrayed,
[1534.12 → 1546.50] The sin of man and wrath of God has been on Jesus' name.
[1549.58 → 1560.12] Silent as he stood accused, beaten, mocked, and scorned,
[1560.12 → 1570.46] Bowing to the Father's will, he took a crown of gold.
[1571.48 → 1582.12] Oh, that rugged cross, my salvation, where your love poured out over me,
[1582.12 → 1593.12] Now my soul cries out, Hallelujah, praise and honour unto thee.
[1593.12 → 1606.96] Scent of heaven, God's own Son, to purchase and redeem,
[1608.46 → 1618.28] And reconcile the very ones who nailed him to that tree.
[1618.28 → 1629.62] Oh, that rugged cross, my salvation, where your love poured out over me,
[1630.56 → 1640.84] Now my soul cries out, Hallelujah, praise and honour unto thee.
[1640.84 → 1656.28] Now my debt is paid, it is paid in full, By the precious blood that my Jesus spilled,
[1656.60 → 1666.84] Now the curse of sin has no hold on me, When the Son sets free, always free indeed.
[1666.84 → 1679.04] Now my debt is paid, it is paid in full, By the precious blood that my Jesus spilled,
[1679.04 → 1690.18] Now the curse of sin has no hold on me, When the Son sets free, always free indeed.
[1690.18 → 1700.18] Oh, that rugged cross, my salvation, Where your love poured out over me,
[1700.18 → 1711.18] Now my soul cries out, Hallelujah, praise and honour unto thee.
[1711.18 → 1726.18] See the stone is rolled away, Behold the empty tomb,
[1726.18 → 1737.18] Hallelujah, God be praised, He's risen from the grave,
[1737.18 → 1749.18] Oh, that rugged cross, my salvation, Where your love poured out over me,
[1749.18 → 1759.18] Now my soul cries out, Hallelujah, Praise and honour unto thee.
[1759.18 → 1766.18] Praise and honour unto thee.
[1766.18 → 1779.52] Good morning, kids. Welcome to Kids' Corner today.
[1779.98 → 1782.66] I want to get you guys all just to stand up for a minute.
[1783.26 → 1785.48] Maybe you've been standing, but in case you haven't, stand up.
[1786.06 → 1788.84] Before we get started, I just want us all to take a little stretch break.
[1788.92 → 1791.18] Sometimes I need to do this just to focus.
[1791.18 → 1793.18] Okay, so I want you to just do that with me.
[1793.18 → 1798.18] Put your hands up, stretch up, and stretch down all the way to your toes.
[1798.18 → 1801.18] And then some arm circles like this.
[1801.18 → 1807.18] Awesome. Okay, now take about maybe five to ten steps forward toward your TV,
[1807.18 → 1811.18] and come and sit down so you're ready for Kids' Corner.
[1811.18 → 1814.04] All right, it's an extra special day today.
[1814.24 → 1816.78] You guys know what holiday it is today.
[1816.88 → 1818.16] We've been talking about it at church.
[1818.28 → 1819.96] It's Easter Sunday.
[1820.68 → 1822.82] And Pastor Chris said it's one of his favourite days,
[1822.94 → 1824.72] and it's one of my favourite days too.
[1825.18 → 1827.78] And one of my favourite stories of the Bible, like I always say.
[1827.94 → 1830.76] But today is actually, I think, my favourite one.
[1830.94 → 1833.06] So I'm excited to be here.
[1833.22 → 1834.94] And we're going to get started, though, first,
[1834.94 → 1840.12] before we get to our story with our memory verse.
[1840.44 → 1840.82] All right.
[1841.48 → 1844.60] This time we have a verse from the New Testament again.
[1844.72 → 1847.52] It's from the book of John, chapter 3, verse 16.
[1847.52 → 1852.14] And it's a super famous one, but it's a really important one to know.
[1852.28 → 1855.18] So let's read it together first, and then we'll do some actions.
[1855.18 → 1861.34] For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,
[1861.78 → 1864.76] that whoever believes in him will not perish.
[1865.48 → 1866.96] Another word for that is died.
[1867.40 → 1870.72] Or will not perish, but have eternal life.
[1871.00 → 1872.16] John 3, 16.
[1873.50 → 1873.80] All right.
[1873.84 → 1877.18] So let's do some actions to help get this verse into our minds here.
[1877.26 → 1880.14] So I invite everyone, however old you are, to join me.
[1880.88 → 1884.22] The beginning, it gets easy, and then it gets a little tricky with the actions.
[1884.22 → 1885.78] So watch closely.
[1886.40 → 1888.00] We'll start with the action for God.
[1888.08 → 1890.22] We've done this one before, and it's taking your hand
[1890.22 → 1891.92] and just going straight down your body.
[1892.18 → 1901.04] So for God so loved the world, he gave his one and only Son,
[1902.02 → 1907.34] that whoever believes in him shall not perish.
[1908.12 → 1909.50] So for this, I'll just show you.
[1909.50 → 1912.98] You're going to take one palm face up, one palm face down,
[1912.98 → 1916.08] and then you're going to switch them, and then switch them back.
[1916.62 → 1921.42] So perish like this, but have eternal life.
[1921.74 → 1924.64] So eternal, we're going to start by pointing up and making a little circle,
[1925.08 → 1928.86] and then we're going to switch, and you're going to stick your thumb and your pinky out,
[1928.94 → 1931.92] put the rest of the fingers away, and kind of like you're going off a jump.
[1932.28 → 1933.24] Life like this.
[1933.82 → 1936.08] So it goes eternal life.
[1936.26 → 1938.38] They kind of go right into one another.
[1938.38 → 1939.96] I think you can do it.
[1940.02 → 1942.16] So let's just try it one more time all together,
[1942.16 → 1944.16] and then we'll practice this throughout the month.
[1945.76 → 1951.12] For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,
[1951.62 → 1957.92] that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal life.
[1958.58 → 1960.10] John 3, 16.
[1960.96 → 1961.32] Awesome.
[1961.52 → 1962.52] Thanks for joining me in that.
[1963.00 → 1964.82] So we're going to get started on our story,
[1964.94 → 1967.26] but first I have to tell you a little warning.
[1967.26 → 1969.78] So today, Kids' Corner is going to be in two parts.
[1969.90 → 1973.20] So this is part one, and then after the sermon's done,
[1973.24 → 1974.26] you're going to have to come back.
[1974.34 → 1977.02] So don't go running off too far after the sermon,
[1977.12 → 1978.36] because I'm going to come back up here,
[1978.44 → 1981.24] and we have to finish the second part of our story after.
[1982.58 → 1984.14] First, before we get started, I have a question.
[1984.26 → 1986.86] Has anyone ever been on a roller coaster?
[1987.50 → 1989.08] Put your hand up if you've been on a roller coaster.
[1989.60 → 1991.28] So I really like roller coasters,
[1991.58 → 1993.18] although it's been a while since I've been on one.
[1993.80 → 1996.66] And Easter to me always kind of reminds me of a roller coaster,
[1996.66 → 1998.58] because what does a roller coaster do?
[1999.02 → 2001.88] It goes up and down and up and down and around,
[2002.18 → 2004.38] and you kind of get all jumbled up in your head.
[2005.14 → 2006.52] And the really the best roller coasters,
[2006.70 → 2010.48] they bring out this feeling inside you that's both terrified,
[2010.78 → 2013.36] but also really excited and happy.
[2013.76 → 2015.66] And if a good roller coaster isn't terrifying,
[2015.78 → 2017.96] then it's probably not good enough for me.
[2018.46 → 2020.14] So Easter reminds me of that,
[2020.20 → 2021.78] because we get through Good Friday,
[2022.08 → 2024.88] and it brings out a lot of sadness, and it's hard.
[2024.88 → 2026.18] And then we get Easter Sunday,
[2026.18 → 2029.08] and now we're jumping over to joyful and happy.
[2030.04 → 2032.38] And we're going to kind of talk about both of those things today.
[2032.56 → 2035.74] So before we get started, I've got to get my props here.
[2041.74 → 2042.54] All right.
[2044.00 → 2044.44] Okay.
[2045.08 → 2047.06] So, my story too.
[2047.18 → 2050.06] We're going to start here with some special items
[2050.06 → 2052.00] I can show you as the story goes.
[2053.42 → 2055.68] You remember last week with Mr. Mike,
[2055.76 → 2058.50] we talked about Peter denying Jesus.
[2058.62 → 2060.24] So you remember that Jesus got arrested,
[2060.54 → 2061.64] and they took him away.
[2061.98 → 2064.02] So this is the continuation of that.
[2064.14 → 2067.08] So Jesus now is in the hands of the authorities,
[2067.44 → 2069.52] and people aren't very happy with him.
[2069.64 → 2071.38] So let's read what happens.
[2071.38 → 2075.68] The night of Jesus' arrest was a sad night.
[2076.28 → 2077.88] Jesus heard the angry crowd,
[2078.32 → 2079.30] Crucify him!
[2079.54 → 2080.32] Crucify him!
[2080.36 → 2080.86] They shouted.
[2081.76 → 2084.08] Pilate, their ruler, he was puzzled.
[2084.88 → 2086.56] What crime has Jesus done?
[2086.70 → 2087.50] He asked the crowd.
[2087.86 → 2089.54] But the people just shouted louder,
[2089.68 → 2090.48] Crucify him!
[2091.44 → 2093.04] So Pilate's soldiers,
[2093.22 → 2094.34] they whipped Jesus,
[2094.80 → 2096.10] and they made fun of him.
[2096.74 → 2099.98] They put a sharp crown of thorns on Jesus' head.
[2099.98 → 2102.98] I have an example here of a crown of thorns.
[2103.20 → 2104.38] It even has a string,
[2104.52 → 2106.04] and the box that this came in
[2106.04 → 2108.30] had like a liability disclaimer
[2108.30 → 2110.70] about not making a big deal
[2110.70 → 2111.80] if you get injured by this.
[2111.86 → 2112.56] It's quite sharp.
[2112.66 → 2113.54] It's real thorns.
[2114.68 → 2116.54] I can't imagine being this shoved on my head.
[2116.68 → 2117.98] It would not feel great.
[2118.72 → 2120.96] Look, they put one of these on Jesus' head,
[2121.78 → 2123.96] and they spit on him,
[2124.02 → 2126.32] and they made fun of him again and again.
[2126.74 → 2127.80] Then they put,
[2127.80 → 2130.60] the soldiers put a heavy cross on his back,
[2131.14 → 2133.22] and Jesus tried to walk.
[2133.28 → 2133.82] He stumbled.
[2133.98 → 2134.54] He fell.
[2135.66 → 2136.92] At the top of the hill,
[2137.44 → 2138.14] the soldiers,
[2138.26 → 2140.58] they nailed Jesus to a cross.
[2140.58 → 2158.66] They pounded that cross into the ground,
[2158.86 → 2160.72] and people still came by,
[2160.82 → 2161.94] and they made fun of him.
[2162.36 → 2162.82] They said,
[2162.92 → 2164.94] well, if you're really the son of God,
[2165.04 → 2166.36] why don't you save yourself?
[2166.36 → 2168.92] The nails,
[2169.14 → 2170.96] those would have hurt very much.
[2171.40 → 2172.32] So did the teasing,
[2172.72 → 2174.42] but Jesus didn't come down,
[2174.78 → 2175.86] even though he could have.
[2176.22 → 2178.94] He stayed on the cross for you and for me.
[2180.02 → 2180.92] At noon,
[2181.02 → 2182.98] around what we call lunchtime,
[2183.06 → 2184.32] something really strange happened.
[2184.42 → 2185.98] The sun disappeared,
[2186.48 → 2188.62] and the sky turned very dark like night.
[2189.18 → 2189.94] What's happening?
[2190.04 → 2191.16] The people asked each other.
[2191.38 → 2192.10] It was frightening.
[2192.10 → 2195.20] Then Jesus cried out in a loud voice,
[2195.70 → 2196.30] my God,
[2196.46 → 2197.08] my God,
[2197.22 → 2198.96] why have you forgotten me?
[2199.64 → 2201.32] And then Jesus died.
[2203.26 → 2203.78] Well,
[2203.84 → 2204.70] later that afternoon,
[2204.82 → 2206.02] some of Jesus' friends,
[2206.32 → 2206.96] they came,
[2207.08 → 2209.86] and they asked to take Jesus' body down from the cross.
[2211.24 → 2213.20] We're going to use these marshmallows here
[2213.20 → 2214.82] to represent Jesus' body.
[2216.06 → 2216.56] Okay,
[2216.72 → 2218.84] this is going to be our Jesus for the next part.
[2218.84 → 2222.24] They wanted to put,
[2222.54 → 2224.12] they wanted to bury him in their tomb,
[2224.22 → 2225.14] so they took his body,
[2225.26 → 2227.44] and they put some special oil and spices,
[2227.64 → 2228.78] like would have been their custom.
[2229.52 → 2232.08] I'm going to pretend that this butter here is the oil,
[2233.08 → 2236.14] and then some spices here is the cinnamon and the sugar.
[2242.08 → 2243.20] After they had done that,
[2243.26 → 2244.18] they took his body,
[2244.52 → 2247.08] and they wrapped him up in clean cloths.
[2247.08 → 2250.08] I'm going to use one of these rules here.
[2250.70 → 2251.84] And they would have wrapped him up.
[2252.80 → 2253.18] And remember,
[2253.30 → 2254.58] these people were Jesus' friends,
[2254.68 → 2257.50] so they were doing this to honour Jesus.
[2258.56 → 2260.08] And they wrapped him all up.
[2262.38 → 2263.10] And then,
[2263.78 → 2266.66] they took him,
[2266.78 → 2267.88] and they put him in the tomb.
[2267.88 → 2275.42] And they closed it.
[2277.94 → 2280.92] And they rolled a huge stone in front of the entrance,
[2281.24 → 2282.50] and then they left the garden.
[2283.22 → 2283.38] Now,
[2283.48 → 2283.86] Pilate,
[2283.94 → 2284.30] the ruler,
[2284.42 → 2286.88] he was afraid that they might come and steal his body,
[2287.00 → 2289.84] so he sent some soldiers to guard the entrance.
[2290.74 → 2291.94] And it was all quiet,
[2292.40 → 2293.22] and it was sad.
[2294.42 → 2295.24] Jesus was dead.
[2295.24 → 2295.28] Jesus was dead.
[2297.88 → 2298.84] Now,
[2298.90 → 2301.30] don't forget to come back for the next part,
[2301.34 → 2302.04] after the sermon,
[2302.92 → 2304.10] to see what happens after.
[2304.10 → 2325.92] He is risen.
[2326.36 → 2327.52] He is risen indeed.
[2328.04 → 2328.74] Good morning.
[2328.74 → 2331.24] My name is Kevin Fischer.
[2331.80 → 2335.38] I'm the serving elder this morning on Easter Sunday.
[2336.28 → 2339.92] We're going to continue our worship with our offerings and tithes.
[2341.38 → 2342.54] For the first one,
[2342.64 → 2344.08] it's for Langley Emanuel,
[2344.40 → 2345.20] CRC Ministries,
[2345.36 → 2346.04] and Missions.
[2347.30 → 2349.04] And the second one is for Resonate,
[2349.32 → 2350.38] Global Mission.
[2351.56 → 2354.32] Continuing the good work of home missions and world missions,
[2354.56 → 2357.78] Resonate's vision is to bring the gospel to people.
[2357.78 → 2359.26] Neighbourhoods,
[2359.48 → 2360.06] communities,
[2361.02 → 2365.08] churches in the world to embolden them in participating in God's mission,
[2366.10 → 2368.98] and faithfully proclaiming and living out the good news of Jesus.
[2368.98 → 2371.72] Next week,
[2371.72 → 2377.32] we have a special offering for World Renew Refugee Sponsorship and Resettlement.
[2378.80 → 2380.72] Proverbs 3, 9 to 10 says,
[2380.80 → 2385.42] Honour the Lord with your wealth and the first fruits of all your produce.
[2386.38 → 2388.60] And then your barns will be filled with plenty,
[2388.80 → 2390.90] and your vats will be bursting with wine.
[2390.90 → 2394.64] We've been blessed to be a blessing.
[2395.52 → 2396.48] So give generously,
[2397.10 → 2399.56] as the Lord has been generous to you.
[2401.38 → 2402.74] And you can give
[2402.74 → 2406.08] from many of the ways that are available through our website,
[2406.54 → 2408.50] electronically and such.
[2408.50 → 2415.90] Before I go to the congregational prayer or family prayer,
[2416.28 → 2419.76] I do have an announcement from council to make this morning.
[2421.42 → 2427.30] We're in the season of nominating office bearers for council.
[2427.30 → 2430.82] Jesus Christ has set up his church
[2430.82 → 2433.66] and has promised to provide leadership for her.
[2434.56 → 2436.94] As Ephesians 4, 12 to 13 states,
[2437.62 → 2439.58] to equip his people for works of service
[2439.58 → 2441.74] so that the body of Christ may be built up
[2441.74 → 2444.90] until we all reach unity in the faith
[2444.90 → 2447.28] and in the knowledge of the Son of God
[2447.28 → 2448.86] and become mature,
[2449.36 → 2451.84] attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
[2451.84 → 2457.40] We know that God calls each of us to serve in the church,
[2458.22 → 2460.14] and some as elders and deacons.
[2461.14 → 2463.16] In the call of the church through nominations,
[2463.42 → 2468.02] the call of God is to serve the bride of Christ.
[2469.82 → 2471.18] This week will be,
[2471.82 → 2475.84] well, there will be electronic nomination form
[2475.84 → 2477.84] sent in the midweek memo
[2477.84 → 2480.00] and next Sunday's e-bulletin.
[2480.00 → 2485.00] It will be accessible for all members of this congregation
[2485.00 → 2487.00] from now until April 19th,
[2487.46 → 2489.96] when the nomination process will close.
[2490.92 → 2494.58] If accessing this electronic form is difficult for you at home,
[2495.20 → 2496.64] please contact your district elder.
[2497.34 → 2499.02] Paper copies can be made available
[2499.02 → 2501.26] to be delivered or picked up at the church office.
[2501.26 → 2504.62] There are several vacancies,
[2505.30 → 2506.58] seven to be exact,
[2507.32 → 2509.08] in all three offices on council,
[2509.44 → 2512.94] including admin elder, pastoral elder, and deacon.
[2512.94 → 2516.98] We ask that you please contact the person
[2516.98 → 2517.94] you would like to nominate
[2517.94 → 2521.68] before nominating them through the electronic form.
[2522.58 → 2524.28] They need to agree to be nominated.
[2525.66 → 2527.66] If you have any clarifying questions
[2527.66 → 2528.94] regarding this nomination process,
[2529.94 → 2532.60] please contact your district elder or me
[2532.60 → 2536.78] at council, council at licrc.ca.
[2537.60 → 2538.16] Thank you.
[2538.16 → 2544.40] Please join me in our church family prayer this morning.
[2549.88 → 2552.00] Lord God, you love this world so much
[2552.00 → 2554.54] that you gave your one and only son
[2554.54 → 2557.18] that we might be called your children too.
[2558.30 → 2561.76] With resurrection power, you have given us freedom.
[2562.76 → 2565.20] No longer bound by sin and darkness,
[2565.20 → 2567.54] we are living in the light of your goodness.
[2568.76 → 2571.60] Lord, help us to live in the gladness and grace
[2571.60 → 2574.16] of Easter Sunday, every day.
[2575.18 → 2577.98] Let us have hearts of thankfulness for your sacrifice.
[2579.22 → 2581.40] Let us have eyes that look upon your grace
[2581.40 → 2583.24] and rejoice in our salvation.
[2584.18 → 2586.96] And help us to walk in that mighty grace
[2586.96 → 2590.50] and tell your good news to the world today.
[2590.50 → 2595.94] Lord, as we celebrate the holidays like Easter this weekend,
[2596.06 → 2599.28] we continue to pray for families that have lost loved ones,
[2600.04 → 2602.64] asking them that you sustain them with your peace
[2602.64 → 2604.42] during this time.
[2606.18 → 2609.20] We pray for comfort and strength for the Wind family
[2609.20 → 2611.62] in the passing of Sam's brother
[2611.62 → 2614.62] after a battle with pancreatic cancer.
[2614.62 → 2617.88] May they experience your presence
[2617.88 → 2621.86] as they remember and celebrate his life.
[2623.64 → 2625.96] We also pray for comfort and peace
[2625.96 → 2629.04] that passes all understanding on Pastor George Kulun,
[2629.90 → 2631.96] the Kulun and Retire families,
[2632.46 → 2636.18] and the Bridge Church in the passing of Kim Kulun on Friday.
[2637.84 → 2640.26] Despite the grief that comes with loss,
[2640.64 → 2642.78] there is comfort in knowing George's wife Kim
[2642.78 → 2644.30] is free from fighting cancer.
[2646.86 → 2649.46] We pray for families expecting babies.
[2649.62 → 2651.46] And Lord, we celebrate in Thanksgiving
[2651.46 → 2653.94] with Daniel and Dismay Howling,
[2654.48 → 2657.18] who are blessed with a healthy baby girl, Daphne.
[2658.22 → 2661.10] We give thanks for this precious new life.
[2663.94 → 2666.30] And Lord, we pray for the nomination process.
[2667.20 → 2669.26] Lord, we know that you are calling a number of people
[2669.26 → 2672.24] to serve in this unique capacity of leadership.
[2673.40 → 2674.76] Whoever you have in mind,
[2675.52 → 2677.06] may they hear your voice clearly,
[2677.20 → 2679.52] and may they have the courage to accept your call
[2679.52 → 2681.12] in the coming weeks.
[2682.88 → 2684.78] Lord, we pray for those in our congregation,
[2684.94 → 2686.16] as well as friends and family
[2686.16 → 2688.64] who suffer from chronic and serious health issues
[2688.64 → 2690.44] on a daily basis.
[2691.44 → 2694.34] May they experience your provision and nearness each day.
[2694.34 → 2698.42] We pray for those who are struggling with hurting
[2698.42 → 2699.76] and broken relationships.
[2700.60 → 2702.52] May they experience reconciliation,
[2703.28 → 2704.86] restoration, and healing.
[2706.14 → 2709.64] And in the event the relationship cannot be restored,
[2709.78 → 2711.48] Lord, we pray for strength and protection
[2711.48 → 2714.02] on the children that may be involved
[2714.02 → 2715.92] in any custody arrangements.
[2717.08 → 2719.52] May they experience your unfailing love.
[2719.52 → 2723.40] Lord, we pray for your nearness to all those
[2723.40 → 2725.06] in our congregation who are shut in,
[2725.38 → 2728.32] isolated, or may be experiencing loneliness,
[2729.00 → 2730.14] depression, and anxiety.
[2731.04 → 2732.92] We pray for strength and encouragement
[2732.92 → 2734.22] during their difficulties,
[2734.96 → 2737.18] and for protection over them and their caregivers.
[2738.72 → 2740.74] May it serve as a reminder for us
[2740.74 → 2742.32] and the church family to reach out
[2742.32 → 2745.06] and to connect with those in need.
[2745.06 → 2749.62] Lord, we're praying for families impacted by COVID
[2749.62 → 2750.62] over the Easter weekend.
[2751.44 → 2753.30] We know that we haven't been able to have
[2753.30 → 2754.52] the gatherings we wanted
[2754.52 → 2756.80] and see all the people we'd like to see.
[2757.76 → 2759.82] Many of us are suffering from COVID fatigue
[2759.82 → 2761.86] and as a result are sometimes not making
[2761.86 → 2763.24] the best decisions.
[2765.04 → 2767.38] Lord, we're praying for an end to this pandemic.
[2768.60 → 2770.70] We're thankful the vaccines are here
[2770.70 → 2771.62] and getting in arms.
[2772.48 → 2774.52] We're hopeful the vaccines will have an impact
[2774.52 → 2776.04] on preventing further spread
[2776.04 → 2778.00] and people from being sick.
[2779.14 → 2781.62] However, as cases of variants continue to rise,
[2781.74 → 2783.86] we continue to pray for wisdom and discernment
[2783.86 → 2785.42] for our various government leaders,
[2786.38 → 2787.66] including our health officers,
[2787.76 → 2790.94] as they do their best to protect all of us.
[2792.38 → 2794.46] We pray for the COVID long haulers,
[2794.54 → 2796.00] the young and old that have recovered
[2796.00 → 2797.44] but still have lasting symptoms
[2797.44 → 2799.06] from the disease that is impacting
[2799.06 → 2800.30] their quality of life.
[2801.52 → 2803.14] Many of them suffer with fatigue
[2803.14 → 2804.66] and difficulty breathing
[2804.66 → 2807.38] are unable to work or return to work
[2807.38 → 2810.46] and are struggling with normal daily tasks.
[2813.04 → 2815.38] Lord, we continue to pray for insight and wisdom
[2815.38 → 2817.70] for the leadership of Emmanuel Syracuse as well.
[2817.70 → 2822.20] as we are, as those who are volunteering their time,
[2822.90 → 2825.24] we pray for a spirit of patience and grace
[2825.24 → 2827.36] and cooperation as we continue to work together
[2827.36 → 2829.58] in navigating the health authority orders.
[2831.44 → 2832.54] Pray for all of us,
[2832.64 → 2834.36] that we will continue to have the patience
[2834.36 → 2836.62] to practice the measures required to be safe
[2836.62 → 2840.32] and considerate of those with whom we are in contact
[2840.32 → 2842.04] for the safety and benefit of all.
[2843.64 → 2845.14] And Lord, we pray for Pastor Chris,
[2845.14 → 2846.62] who delivers your word this morning.
[2847.84 → 2849.72] May you give him the words to share.
[2850.48 → 2852.56] May we have the ears and the hearts to hear
[2852.56 → 2855.20] and put into practice in our daily week,
[2855.48 → 2856.64] our weekly routines.
[2857.64 → 2859.96] So Lord, we pray for strength in the hard times,
[2860.42 → 2862.52] for joy in the happy times,
[2863.26 → 2864.00] and most of all,
[2864.06 → 2865.90] to remember the hope we have in Jesus,
[2866.58 → 2868.84] the one who died for us and has risen.
[2869.68 → 2871.20] All for the glory we pray.
[2871.20 → 2874.04] Lord, amen.
[2875.14 → 2883.72] Good morning.
[2884.10 → 2887.30] As we spend some time in God's word,
[2887.36 → 2889.36] we're going to look at Luke 24.
[2890.34 → 2892.10] And really, we're going to spend some time
[2892.10 → 2893.90] looking at the whole of Luke 24.
[2894.20 → 2896.38] And so I'm going to do things a little bit differently
[2896.38 → 2897.54] with you this morning,
[2897.96 → 2901.40] in that I'm not going to start by reading the text beforehand.
[2901.40 → 2905.18] But if you have a Bible in your hands,
[2905.18 → 2908.64] it will be really helpful as we refer to different places
[2908.64 → 2911.14] and to the story as we go.
[2911.26 → 2914.44] And so if you need to quickly grab a Bible from somewhere,
[2914.58 → 2916.24] or maybe it's your phone,
[2916.38 → 2917.64] grab that, turn it on,
[2918.06 → 2919.46] get Luke 24 ready,
[2920.14 → 2924.68] because we will dive into different parts of that story together.
[2924.68 → 2932.80] You know, by way of introduction to my message this morning,
[2933.14 → 2934.48] I'm going to ask a question.
[2934.56 → 2937.66] That's a question that is actually from Luke 9.
[2937.80 → 2941.06] In Luke chapter 9, Jesus asks Peter,
[2941.56 → 2942.86] and he says to Peter,
[2942.98 → 2943.70] What about you?
[2944.32 → 2946.94] Who do you say that I am?
[2946.94 → 2953.24] That is the most important question ever asked.
[2954.24 → 2955.52] Not only by Jesus to Peter,
[2955.70 → 2958.06] but to you and to our lives.
[2958.58 → 2961.82] Who do you say that Jesus is?
[2962.54 → 2964.50] How you answer that question
[2964.50 → 2967.92] will have a direct impact on your life.
[2968.90 → 2971.14] Equally, how you live
[2971.14 → 2975.04] will tell everyone how you answer that question.
[2975.04 → 2978.56] Perhaps even more than the words you speak.
[2979.56 → 2982.00] Because, to be frank,
[2982.38 → 2985.12] if Jesus changes nothing,
[2985.86 → 2986.86] then who cares?
[2988.00 → 2988.84] Why bother?
[2989.28 → 2990.02] What's the point?
[2991.92 → 2994.12] But if Jesus changes everything,
[2995.00 → 2996.74] then everything changes.
[2998.18 → 3000.26] That's what I want us to see this morning
[3000.26 → 3002.28] as we look at Luke 24.
[3002.28 → 3005.22] The theme for our time here in this text
[3005.22 → 3007.38] is that Jesus changes everything
[3007.38 → 3009.52] because he changed everything.
[3009.96 → 3011.94] And because Jesus changed everything,
[3012.30 → 3014.74] everything about you changes.
[3016.44 → 3018.26] Jesus changes everything
[3018.26 → 3020.62] because he changed everything.
[3020.76 → 3022.84] Now, how did Jesus change everything?
[3023.84 → 3026.62] In a word, resurrection.
[3027.98 → 3029.36] Because of the resurrection,
[3029.36 → 3031.84] Jesus changes everything.
[3033.86 → 3037.46] Because I believe that this is true,
[3037.64 → 3039.20] I want to show you this morning
[3039.20 → 3041.14] three things about the resurrection
[3041.14 → 3043.58] and what is changed by it.
[3043.96 → 3045.20] And we're going to do that together
[3045.20 → 3047.36] under three different headings.
[3047.82 → 3047.96] Right?
[3048.10 → 3049.94] Truth, witness, and mission.
[3050.50 → 3052.04] The truth of the resurrection,
[3052.60 → 3054.90] the witness of the resurrection,
[3054.90 → 3058.30] and the mission of the resurrection.
[3059.18 → 3061.56] Let's start with that first part.
[3062.34 → 3064.52] Jesus changed everything.
[3064.94 → 3065.54] And honestly,
[3066.40 → 3070.90] for some of you participating at home
[3070.90 → 3072.02] and maybe even here,
[3072.78 → 3073.98] this is the hard part.
[3075.48 → 3075.62] Right?
[3075.66 → 3078.60] Some of us think that Jesus changed some things,
[3078.60 → 3079.78] but not everything.
[3079.78 → 3083.94] Some of us think that Jesus was just a dude
[3083.94 → 3085.54] who lived 2,000 years ago,
[3085.68 → 3087.34] and so why should he have any bearing on me
[3087.34 → 3088.24] and my life today?
[3089.16 → 3090.10] There are people,
[3090.22 → 3092.44] and maybe not listening here and right now,
[3092.52 → 3093.68] but in your families,
[3093.80 → 3096.52] in your friends at school or at work,
[3096.58 → 3097.72] your sons or daughters,
[3097.80 → 3099.26] there are people who think
[3099.26 → 3101.26] that the Jesus of the Bible is just made up.
[3103.44 → 3104.42] Even more likely,
[3104.54 → 3105.82] for those of us listening right now,
[3106.42 → 3108.12] there are some of us listening
[3108.12 → 3109.72] who just don't care.
[3111.06 → 3112.40] We don't really see why we should.
[3114.10 → 3115.20] Let me be clear on that, right?
[3115.28 → 3117.98] Some of you have called yourself Christian
[3117.98 → 3120.66] or been called Christian your entire life,
[3120.78 → 3123.62] and this last one of not really caring
[3123.62 → 3125.06] why you should care
[3125.06 → 3127.74] describes you to a T.
[3129.60 → 3130.48] And you know what?
[3131.36 → 3132.44] Honestly, genuinely,
[3132.98 → 3134.24] I get it.
[3135.36 → 3136.84] More than you can know,
[3137.10 → 3137.90] I get it.
[3138.56 → 3139.82] It's hard to believe.
[3140.42 → 3141.46] Some of this,
[3141.76 → 3143.60] especially today on Easter Sunday,
[3143.68 → 3144.88] maybe most of this,
[3145.14 → 3147.40] doesn't make ordinary sense.
[3150.78 → 3152.90] But that's why this story is so beautiful.
[3153.58 → 3155.28] Because even for those of us
[3155.28 → 3156.38] who don't get it,
[3157.34 → 3158.08] even for those of us
[3158.08 → 3158.78] who struggle to believe,
[3158.86 → 3161.20] we find ourselves in this story.
[3161.28 → 3162.16] You got your Bible handy?
[3162.26 → 3163.68] Look with me at a few verses.
[3163.84 → 3165.80] Look at verse 11.
[3165.80 → 3168.52] So the women have gone to the tomb.
[3168.66 → 3170.00] They have seen it empty.
[3170.14 → 3172.16] They have heard from the angels.
[3172.32 → 3173.80] We're reminded of what Jesus has said.
[3173.88 → 3176.00] They went back to tell the other disciples.
[3176.42 → 3176.94] Verse 11,
[3177.34 → 3180.16] but they did not believe the women
[3180.16 → 3182.62] because their words seemed to them
[3182.62 → 3184.00] like nonsense.
[3186.08 → 3186.92] For some of us,
[3186.96 → 3188.60] this seems like nonsense.
[3188.60 → 3189.92] Right?
[3190.00 → 3190.94] Verse 17,
[3190.94 → 3192.40] they stood still,
[3192.60 → 3194.70] their faces downcast.
[3195.76 → 3198.06] It's hard to believe.
[3198.06 → 3200.44] verse 21,
[3201.40 → 3203.44] on the road to Emmaus,
[3203.54 → 3203.98] the story,
[3204.54 → 3206.72] the two disciples have left Jerusalem
[3206.72 → 3207.92] after the crucifixion.
[3208.46 → 3210.26] They are despondent and broken
[3210.26 → 3212.06] and they say to this person
[3212.06 → 3213.04] whom they are walking with,
[3213.08 → 3214.68] who we later find out to be Jesus,
[3215.08 → 3216.82] we had hoped that he was the one
[3216.82 → 3218.72] who was going to redeem Israel.
[3219.06 → 3219.90] We had hoped that,
[3220.00 → 3221.48] but the implication there is,
[3222.00 → 3224.06] now we just don't know.
[3224.06 → 3227.34] Verse 37,
[3227.50 → 3229.42] Jesus appears to his disciples later.
[3229.78 → 3231.04] They were startled and frightened
[3231.04 → 3232.50] thinking they saw a ghost.
[3234.30 → 3235.62] Belief can be hard
[3235.62 → 3238.30] because this isn't ordinary
[3238.30 → 3241.22] in our experience of life.
[3241.42 → 3243.10] What we are talking about here
[3243.10 → 3245.08] is hard and extraordinary
[3245.08 → 3246.18] and for many of us,
[3246.24 → 3247.44] it defies logic
[3247.44 → 3248.44] or at least it defies
[3248.44 → 3250.86] our ordinary experience of reality.
[3250.86 → 3255.34] Can I let you in on an open secret?
[3257.02 → 3259.02] That's been Jesus all along.
[3260.06 → 3261.60] Since the very beginning,
[3262.28 → 3263.86] Jesus has defied
[3263.86 → 3265.80] our ordinary experience of reality.
[3266.14 → 3267.96] In the story of his incarnation,
[3268.70 → 3270.10] you have this virgin woman
[3270.10 → 3273.54] who is become pregnant with child
[3273.54 → 3276.34] and she bears the son of God.
[3277.04 → 3278.38] You have God-man,
[3278.38 → 3279.66] fully human,
[3280.10 → 3280.74] fully God
[3280.74 → 3283.34] in one person
[3283.34 → 3285.16] we call Jesus.
[3286.20 → 3287.48] And if we have a God-man
[3287.48 → 3288.48] who comes into the world,
[3288.58 → 3289.24] that also means
[3289.24 → 3290.74] we need a Saviour
[3290.74 → 3292.52] to save us from ourselves.
[3293.40 → 3294.68] But not just the incarnation,
[3294.98 → 3296.02] not just the beginning of the story,
[3296.10 → 3296.66] all throughout
[3296.66 → 3298.16] has been beyond
[3298.16 → 3299.86] our ordinary experience of reality.
[3299.96 → 3301.06] Even Jesus' teaching
[3301.06 → 3302.16] can be hard.
[3302.70 → 3304.32] Jesus says things like,
[3304.32 → 3306.06] if you want to gain your life,
[3306.16 → 3307.10] you must lose it.
[3307.10 → 3309.16] Jesus says things like,
[3309.46 → 3310.24] blessed are the poor.
[3312.12 → 3312.74] Blessed are you
[3312.74 → 3314.00] when people insult you
[3314.00 → 3315.12] and persecute you
[3315.12 → 3316.22] and falsely say
[3316.22 → 3317.12] all kinds of evil
[3317.12 → 3317.68] against you
[3317.68 → 3318.36] because of me.
[3319.04 → 3320.14] Jesus tells us
[3320.14 → 3322.26] to love our enemies.
[3323.82 → 3326.42] Jesus says something like,
[3326.68 → 3328.12] if your right eye
[3328.12 → 3329.40] causes you to sin,
[3330.08 → 3330.82] gouge it out.
[3330.82 → 3332.08] He says,
[3332.18 → 3333.48] if you want to be perfect,
[3333.62 → 3335.22] go and sell all your possessions
[3335.22 → 3336.08] and give to the poor
[3336.08 → 3336.94] and then you will have
[3336.94 → 3338.26] treasures in heaven.
[3338.94 → 3340.36] Then come and follow me.
[3341.30 → 3342.20] And what Jesus teaches
[3342.20 → 3342.82] in his life
[3342.82 → 3344.54] is that radical obedience
[3344.54 → 3345.88] to God,
[3345.98 → 3346.58] to him,
[3346.66 → 3347.58] is life.
[3347.66 → 3349.00] And that's counterintuitive
[3349.00 → 3350.06] in our culture.
[3350.60 → 3351.58] That doesn't make sense
[3351.58 → 3352.42] to us.
[3352.52 → 3354.06] And then finally now,
[3355.18 → 3356.38] the story of the resurrection.
[3356.38 → 3361.08] On the first day of the week,
[3361.80 → 3363.06] very early in the morning,
[3363.88 → 3365.10] the women took the spices
[3365.10 → 3365.86] they had prepared
[3365.86 → 3366.68] and went to the tomb.
[3368.04 → 3369.34] They found the stone
[3369.34 → 3370.62] rolled away from the tomb.
[3371.12 → 3371.80] But when they entered,
[3371.90 → 3372.92] they did not find the body
[3372.92 → 3373.70] of the Lord Jesus.
[3374.74 → 3375.72] And while they were wondering
[3375.72 → 3376.32] about this,
[3376.40 → 3377.78] suddenly two men in clothes
[3377.78 → 3379.02] that gleamed like lightning
[3379.02 → 3380.00] stood beside them.
[3380.16 → 3381.12] And in their fright,
[3381.20 → 3382.02] the women bowed
[3382.02 → 3383.60] with their faces to the ground.
[3383.60 → 3384.68] But the men said to them,
[3384.98 → 3386.68] Why do you look for the living
[3386.68 → 3387.78] among the dead?
[3387.86 → 3388.92] He is not here.
[3389.00 → 3389.74] He has risen.
[3390.54 → 3392.20] Remember how he told you
[3392.20 → 3394.40] while he was still with you
[3394.40 → 3395.04] in Galilee.
[3395.40 → 3396.28] The Son of Man
[3396.28 → 3396.98] must be delivered
[3396.98 → 3398.18] over to the hands of sinners,
[3398.30 → 3398.86] be crucified,
[3399.36 → 3400.90] and on the third day
[3400.90 → 3402.84] be raised again.
[3406.14 → 3407.16] Let me tell you,
[3408.16 → 3410.20] if the resurrection
[3410.20 → 3412.36] is true,
[3412.36 → 3414.70] then all the rest
[3414.70 → 3416.00] is true as well.
[3416.42 → 3417.12] The resurrection
[3417.12 → 3418.70] is the foundation
[3418.70 → 3421.68] on which stands
[3421.68 → 3423.46] all of our faith
[3423.46 → 3424.32] and belief.
[3424.90 → 3426.30] And that's true historically
[3426.30 → 3428.00] and as far even
[3428.00 → 3429.40] as salvation is possible.
[3429.70 → 3430.64] That's what Paul says
[3430.64 → 3432.00] in 1 Corinthians 15.
[3432.36 → 3433.42] Christians have known
[3433.42 → 3434.48] this to be true
[3434.48 → 3435.64] since the very beginning.
[3436.04 → 3436.82] The resurrection
[3436.82 → 3438.64] is the foundation
[3438.64 → 3440.92] on which all of our life
[3440.92 → 3442.78] and faith stands.
[3444.38 → 3445.74] And if it's not true,
[3446.74 → 3448.40] none of this matters.
[3450.02 → 3450.80] Let me tell you,
[3450.90 → 3452.52] as Luke writes this story,
[3452.60 → 3453.74] as the other gospel writers
[3453.74 → 3454.74] write this story,
[3454.78 → 3457.06] it has all the hallmarks
[3457.06 → 3458.54] of being true.
[3458.54 → 3461.70] Now, we're not going to get
[3461.70 → 3463.34] into all of this
[3463.34 → 3465.08] and to every single argument
[3465.08 → 3465.46] for this,
[3465.52 → 3466.28] but I want to just
[3466.28 → 3468.24] equip you with a couple here.
[3468.40 → 3469.50] And so, again,
[3469.58 → 3470.62] with your Bibles handy,
[3470.78 → 3472.10] flip back to the beginning
[3472.10 → 3472.70] of Luke.
[3472.80 → 3473.70] Luke chapter 1.
[3475.70 → 3476.66] Luke chapter 1.
[3476.72 → 3478.14] The very opening words
[3478.14 → 3478.88] of Luke.
[3479.00 → 3479.18] Here,
[3479.30 → 3481.04] hear what Luke says.
[3481.20 → 3481.46] He says,
[3481.46 → 3492.94] And hear this now.
[3492.94 → 3515.32] Luke's intent
[3515.32 → 3517.42] in writing this gospel message
[3517.42 → 3519.24] is so that you may know
[3519.24 → 3520.20] the certainty
[3520.20 → 3521.30] of the things
[3521.30 → 3522.04] which you have been taught.
[3522.26 → 3523.18] And to do that,
[3523.26 → 3524.40] he has investigated
[3524.40 → 3525.44] like an expert.
[3526.56 → 3526.92] And remember,
[3527.02 → 3527.80] Luke's no fool.
[3528.30 → 3529.14] Luke is a doctor.
[3529.50 → 3530.78] He has official training
[3530.78 → 3533.06] in the Greek scholastic system
[3533.06 → 3533.92] of his day.
[3534.08 → 3534.42] And so,
[3534.48 → 3535.54] he knows how to do
[3535.54 → 3536.76] rigorous investigation.
[3537.08 → 3538.06] He knows how to do
[3538.06 → 3539.68] historical investigation.
[3539.96 → 3540.70] He knows how to
[3540.70 → 3541.50] fact check
[3541.50 → 3542.36] and counter check
[3542.36 → 3543.30] and listen to witnesses
[3543.30 → 3543.96] and seek them out.
[3543.98 → 3544.16] In fact,
[3544.16 → 3544.60] he says,
[3544.82 → 3546.46] he does just that.
[3546.46 → 3547.38] He sought out
[3547.38 → 3548.30] the eyewitnesses
[3548.30 → 3549.26] and servants of the word
[3549.26 → 3550.20] and he carefully
[3550.20 → 3552.10] investigated everything
[3552.10 → 3552.88] from the beginning.
[3554.30 → 3556.20] Luke is no slouch.
[3556.50 → 3558.20] He's no propagandist.
[3559.10 → 3560.32] He is an academic
[3560.32 → 3562.04] and a professional
[3562.04 → 3564.36] and he applies those skills
[3564.36 → 3567.96] to his gospel writing experience.
[3570.94 → 3572.40] And you can see that
[3572.40 → 3575.66] even in chapter 24.
[3576.46 → 3578.08] Now,
[3578.12 → 3580.46] there's a whole branch
[3580.46 → 3581.68] of conversation
[3581.68 → 3582.30] that happens
[3582.30 → 3583.82] around the resurrection story
[3583.82 → 3585.28] that wants to say
[3585.28 → 3586.16] that it is a myth,
[3586.34 → 3586.92] that it is something
[3586.92 → 3589.10] that people have made up,
[3589.18 → 3589.92] that it is a story
[3589.92 → 3590.64] that was told
[3590.64 → 3592.16] in order to propagate
[3592.16 → 3593.00] certain ideas
[3593.00 → 3594.10] or certain forms of power
[3594.10 → 3594.66] in the world
[3594.66 → 3595.08] or the like,
[3595.40 → 3596.02] whatever you do.
[3596.38 → 3597.14] And yet,
[3597.24 → 3598.10] counter to that,
[3598.16 → 3599.28] there is a whole field
[3599.28 → 3599.90] of study
[3599.90 → 3601.20] that looks at
[3601.20 → 3601.96] what it takes
[3601.96 → 3602.92] for a myth
[3602.92 → 3603.54] to develop
[3603.54 → 3604.28] or what it takes
[3604.28 → 3605.38] for a story
[3605.38 → 3606.02] like this
[3606.02 → 3607.04] to become
[3607.04 → 3608.04] enculturated
[3608.04 → 3609.60] if it is not true.
[3611.36 → 3612.50] One of the qualifiers
[3612.50 → 3613.36] to discern
[3613.36 → 3614.54] between a true story
[3614.54 → 3615.52] and a myth
[3615.52 → 3617.84] are precise details
[3617.84 → 3619.22] revealed in the telling
[3619.22 → 3619.68] of the story.
[3619.68 → 3620.48] So let me ask you
[3620.48 → 3620.82] a question
[3620.82 → 3622.06] just by way of comparison.
[3622.62 → 3623.22] For those of you
[3623.22 → 3624.02] sitting here this morning,
[3624.36 → 3625.60] in the story
[3625.60 → 3626.92] of Little Red Riding Hood,
[3627.54 → 3628.70] she's going to visit Grandma.
[3628.70 → 3630.26] how many miles
[3630.26 → 3631.06] on the road
[3631.06 → 3632.24] from her house
[3632.24 → 3632.96] to Grandma's house?
[3636.32 → 3637.24] Nobody knows
[3637.24 → 3639.10] because it doesn't matter.
[3640.00 → 3640.48] Right?
[3640.52 → 3641.84] It's not a true story
[3641.84 → 3642.98] and so however many miles
[3642.98 → 3643.56] there are,
[3643.68 → 3644.62] it doesn't matter.
[3644.98 → 3645.40] And yet,
[3645.58 → 3647.26] look at verse 10.
[3647.78 → 3648.38] We'll start there.
[3648.58 → 3649.76] Verse 10 from Luke 24.
[3650.10 → 3651.18] It was Mary Magdalene,
[3651.34 → 3652.26] Joanna and Mary,
[3652.36 → 3653.06] the mother of James
[3653.06 → 3653.56] and the others
[3653.56 → 3654.18] who were with him.
[3654.52 → 3654.60] Right?
[3655.02 → 3655.98] Luke intentionally
[3655.98 → 3657.44] writes names in there.
[3657.44 → 3659.44] He gives specific details
[3659.44 → 3660.10] that if it was just
[3660.10 → 3660.70] a fake story,
[3660.76 → 3661.22] it wouldn't matter.
[3661.28 → 3662.34] But Luke is basically saying,
[3662.66 → 3663.18] these are the people
[3663.18 → 3663.74] who were there.
[3664.28 → 3664.80] Talk to them.
[3664.90 → 3666.06] Some of them are still alive.
[3666.82 → 3667.70] Check this out.
[3668.38 → 3668.52] Right?
[3668.60 → 3669.32] Verse 13.
[3670.56 → 3671.32] Now that same day,
[3671.38 → 3671.78] two of them
[3671.78 → 3672.64] were going to a village
[3672.64 → 3673.44] called Emmaus
[3673.44 → 3676.14] about seven miles
[3676.14 → 3677.50] from Jerusalem.
[3678.72 → 3679.82] Now why does that matter
[3679.82 → 3681.64] if it's not true?
[3682.60 → 3683.86] If Luke isn't saying,
[3684.38 → 3686.38] this story is historically situated,
[3686.38 → 3688.34] it actually happened.
[3690.60 → 3692.00] C.S. Lewis has a quote.
[3692.10 → 3693.80] Now if you don't know C.S. Lewis,
[3693.88 → 3694.50] what you need to know
[3694.50 → 3696.04] that C.S. Lewis is a Christian apologist,
[3696.24 → 3697.88] but his primary vocation
[3697.88 → 3699.32] was a fiction writer.
[3699.42 → 3700.30] His primary love
[3700.30 → 3702.30] was writing elaborate fantasy.
[3703.16 → 3703.24] Right?
[3703.52 → 3705.36] The Chronicles of Narnia series
[3705.36 → 3706.62] is a great example of that.
[3707.02 → 3707.76] There are others,
[3707.90 → 3708.44] countless others
[3708.44 → 3709.04] that he has written.
[3709.38 → 3710.48] And C.S. Lewis has this quote.
[3710.52 → 3711.48] I'm going to paraphrase it.
[3712.20 → 3712.92] He says that,
[3712.92 → 3714.50] when someone tells me
[3714.50 → 3715.50] that these stories,
[3715.64 → 3716.50] referring to the Gospels,
[3716.60 → 3717.82] are myths and legends,
[3718.02 → 3719.30] I like to ask them,
[3719.88 → 3720.74] how many stories
[3720.74 → 3721.54] of myths and legends
[3721.54 → 3722.20] have you read?
[3722.56 → 3723.20] And for how long
[3723.20 → 3723.88] have you been reading
[3723.88 → 3724.60] myths and legends
[3724.60 → 3725.64] such that you can tell
[3725.64 → 3727.14] when one is one
[3727.14 → 3728.70] by the flavour that it has?
[3729.80 → 3730.64] And then he goes on,
[3730.68 → 3730.98] he says,
[3731.06 → 3732.28] I've spent my whole life
[3732.28 → 3733.18] in these stories
[3733.18 → 3734.36] and writing these stories,
[3734.52 → 3736.88] and this isn't one of them.
[3736.88 → 3741.30] This account has all the hallmarks
[3741.30 → 3744.32] of being true history.
[3747.08 → 3747.82] And again,
[3748.60 → 3750.46] just so we're clear,
[3751.02 → 3752.18] there are some who will say,
[3752.28 → 3753.60] well, it happened so far back
[3753.60 → 3754.22] in the past,
[3754.30 → 3755.04] we cannot know
[3755.04 → 3757.20] that it is true or accurate.
[3757.58 → 3758.24] And I want to say,
[3758.34 → 3760.50] well, let's be fair in that.
[3760.94 → 3761.80] And so here's an example.
[3762.76 → 3762.98] Maybe,
[3763.38 → 3764.32] I'm a student of history,
[3764.42 → 3765.34] and so I like this example,
[3765.34 → 3766.38] but maybe you've heard
[3766.38 → 3768.08] of the Gaelic War, right?
[3768.12 → 3768.78] The Gaelic War
[3768.78 → 3769.66] is the expansion
[3769.66 → 3771.38] of the Roman Empire
[3771.38 → 3772.62] by none other
[3772.62 → 3773.68] than Julius Caesar
[3773.68 → 3775.74] into the region of Gaul,
[3775.80 → 3776.56] which is now sort of
[3776.56 → 3778.02] central and Northern Europe.
[3778.30 → 3779.46] Happened in 50 BC.
[3780.38 → 3782.08] The primary source
[3782.08 → 3783.10] that we have
[3783.10 → 3784.62] for the Gaelic War
[3784.62 → 3786.38] is the account
[3786.38 → 3788.96] written by Julius Caesar himself
[3788.96 → 3791.46] as a third-person narrative.
[3792.70 → 3793.60] So let me make this clear.
[3794.06 → 3795.26] Julius Caesar, right?
[3795.26 → 3795.96] He writes the events
[3795.96 → 3796.90] about himself,
[3797.04 → 3798.00] about his expansion.
[3798.38 → 3800.22] He does so as a story
[3800.22 → 3801.72] in the third person,
[3802.18 → 3803.64] and modern historians
[3803.64 → 3805.74] for the last countless years
[3805.74 → 3807.78] have treated it as true
[3807.78 → 3808.66] and accurate.
[3809.82 → 3810.66] And yet,
[3811.18 → 3812.38] here's what we also know.
[3812.96 → 3813.72] There are fewer
[3813.72 → 3814.66] what are called
[3814.66 → 3815.96] manuscript copies
[3815.96 → 3818.08] of Caesar's account
[3818.08 → 3819.50] than there are
[3819.50 → 3820.42] of the New Testament,
[3820.42 → 3821.54] and it's even further
[3821.54 → 3822.62] back in history,
[3822.76 → 3823.94] and yet for so many people,
[3823.94 → 3824.64] for some of us,
[3824.92 → 3827.32] it's more trusted.
[3828.06 → 3828.92] But if we applied
[3828.92 → 3830.40] the same sorts of rules
[3830.40 → 3832.02] for authority and acceptance
[3832.02 → 3833.36] or the same sort of
[3833.36 → 3836.40] historiographical requirements
[3836.40 → 3838.76] that we do to Julius Caesar,
[3839.12 → 3839.74] what we would see
[3839.74 → 3841.14] is that the Gospels of Jesus'
[3841.40 → 3842.04] life, death,
[3842.12 → 3843.12] and resurrection
[3843.12 → 3845.50] should be just as widely accepted,
[3845.78 → 3846.98] as accurate and true,
[3846.98 → 3849.18] as the Gaelic wars are.
[3850.90 → 3851.66] Like I said,
[3852.56 → 3853.24] the resurrection
[3853.24 → 3855.12] has all the hallmarks
[3855.12 → 3857.38] of being a true story.
[3861.44 → 3863.24] But here's what I
[3863.24 → 3865.06] also realize.
[3866.96 → 3868.28] The real reason
[3868.28 → 3869.78] that people struggle
[3869.78 → 3871.12] to believe the resurrection
[3871.12 → 3874.58] probably isn't
[3874.58 → 3875.84] actually intellectual.
[3877.08 → 3878.14] It's probably not
[3878.14 → 3879.88] an academic problem.
[3880.98 → 3882.14] It's a heart problem.
[3883.32 → 3885.30] When it comes right down to it,
[3885.66 → 3887.08] people don't believe
[3887.08 → 3887.64] in Jesus,
[3887.76 → 3888.90] not because they struggle
[3888.90 → 3889.80] with whether
[3889.80 → 3890.36] he's real
[3890.36 → 3891.54] or because of an intellectual
[3891.54 → 3892.56] opposition for belief.
[3892.72 → 3894.06] That may be the words we use.
[3894.14 → 3894.66] That may be the way
[3894.66 → 3895.72] we characterize it.
[3895.82 → 3896.88] But the truth is,
[3897.00 → 3898.46] if you are willing
[3898.46 → 3899.42] and you are ready
[3899.42 → 3900.50] to dig into
[3900.50 → 3901.76] all of this
[3901.76 → 3903.82] history and philosophy,
[3903.98 → 3904.66] there are countless
[3904.66 → 3906.06] philosophers and theologians
[3906.06 → 3906.64] and historians
[3906.64 → 3907.36] throughout history
[3907.36 → 3908.72] who are smarter than me,
[3909.00 → 3910.14] probably smarter than you,
[3910.42 → 3911.04] who have made
[3911.04 → 3912.18] cogent and compelling
[3912.18 → 3912.92] arguments
[3912.92 → 3914.28] and intellectual cases
[3914.28 → 3914.90] for Jesus
[3914.90 → 3915.78] and for God
[3915.78 → 3916.54] and for the truth
[3916.54 → 3917.42] of the Gospels
[3917.42 → 3918.24] and the reliability
[3918.24 → 3919.34] of the Bible.
[3919.58 → 3920.52] The real problem,
[3920.62 → 3920.84] you see,
[3920.92 → 3921.90] isn't intellectual.
[3922.18 → 3922.98] The real problem
[3922.98 → 3924.08] is existential
[3924.08 → 3925.20] and spiritual.
[3925.36 → 3926.14] The real problem
[3926.14 → 3926.76] for some of us
[3926.76 → 3927.56] is that people
[3927.56 → 3929.28] have disappointed us.
[3930.40 → 3931.64] And so it's made belief
[3931.64 → 3932.80] in this resurrection
[3932.80 → 3935.22] if not impossible
[3935.22 → 3936.30] then hard.
[3938.38 → 3938.82] Because you see,
[3938.90 → 3940.82] Jesus changed everything
[3940.82 → 3942.28] and now everything
[3942.28 → 3944.18] about you changes.
[3944.86 → 3945.78] And for some of us,
[3945.96 → 3947.46] that's the scary part.
[3947.64 → 3949.04] That's the terrifying thing.
[3949.26 → 3949.42] Right?
[3949.50 → 3950.66] If in his life
[3950.66 → 3951.10] and death
[3951.10 → 3951.74] and resurrection,
[3951.98 → 3953.18] Jesus did everything
[3953.18 → 3953.84] for you
[3953.84 → 3954.80] and there's nothing
[3954.80 → 3956.14] that you need to do
[3956.14 → 3957.22] to add to it,
[3957.22 → 3957.54] there's nothing
[3957.54 → 3958.44] that you can do
[3958.44 → 3959.44] to add to it
[3959.44 → 3960.20] or to earn it
[3960.20 → 3960.90] if it is all
[3960.90 → 3962.06] by grace through faith
[3962.06 → 3963.24] and is not of yourselves,
[3963.34 → 3964.46] it is the gift of God
[3964.46 → 3965.12] so that no man
[3965.12 → 3965.92] or woman or child
[3965.92 → 3966.42] can boast.
[3966.62 → 3967.94] If all of that is true
[3967.94 → 3969.18] and I believe it is,
[3969.42 → 3970.12] that means
[3970.12 → 3971.38] that as a result
[3971.38 → 3971.72] of that,
[3971.82 → 3972.58] there is nothing
[3972.58 → 3973.90] in this life
[3973.90 → 3974.56] that Jesus
[3974.56 → 3975.62] can't ask
[3975.62 → 3976.46] of you
[3976.46 → 3978.08] once he's given you
[3978.08 → 3978.80] that grace and gift.
[3980.08 → 3981.34] And for some of us,
[3981.92 → 3983.00] that's too much.
[3983.00 → 3985.30] that's too scary
[3985.30 → 3986.72] because we like
[3986.72 → 3988.00] our little lives
[3988.00 → 3989.04] on our own,
[3989.16 → 3990.40] in our own control.
[3990.82 → 3992.18] We've become complacent
[3992.18 → 3993.86] in these bodies of death
[3993.86 → 3994.70] so much so
[3994.70 → 3995.74] that the possibility
[3995.74 → 3996.92] of real life,
[3997.06 → 3997.98] of knowing the creator
[3997.98 → 3998.52] of the world
[3998.52 → 3999.22] and being known
[3999.22 → 4000.00] by the creator
[4000.00 → 4000.58] of the world
[4000.58 → 4002.12] is a scary thing.
[4003.60 → 4004.80] True life
[4004.80 → 4005.98] is scary
[4005.98 → 4008.10] for those of us
[4008.10 → 4009.54] stuck in death.
[4009.54 → 4012.86] being
[4012.86 → 4014.32] and basking
[4014.32 → 4015.60] in the light
[4015.60 → 4017.02] of our glorious God
[4017.02 → 4018.80] is terrifying
[4018.80 → 4020.88] for those of us
[4020.88 → 4021.88] who love the dark.
[4023.78 → 4025.06] The Bible says
[4025.06 → 4028.34] that if anyone
[4028.34 → 4030.04] is in Christ,
[4030.98 → 4032.14] the new creation
[4032.14 → 4033.46] has come.
[4033.60 → 4034.90] The old is gone
[4034.90 → 4035.94] and the new
[4035.94 → 4037.48] is here.
[4037.48 → 4042.44] a friend
[4042.44 → 4045.10] who's back
[4045.10 → 4046.78] east
[4046.78 → 4047.70] so you don't know
[4047.70 → 4048.42] who I'm talking about
[4048.42 → 4049.44] but I'm going to call him Mike.
[4050.52 → 4051.32] He is
[4051.32 → 4052.38] what many people
[4052.38 → 4052.74] would call
[4052.74 → 4054.46] a churched person.
[4054.90 → 4055.40] What that means
[4055.40 → 4056.18] is he grew up
[4056.18 → 4056.68] in the church
[4056.68 → 4057.34] and then based on
[4057.34 → 4058.20] a number of circumstances
[4058.20 → 4059.02] and life realities
[4059.02 → 4060.14] he left
[4060.14 → 4061.62] and now wants
[4061.62 → 4062.32] nothing
[4062.32 → 4063.42] to do with that.
[4063.50 → 4064.38] The primary reason
[4064.38 → 4064.84] that Mike
[4064.84 → 4065.74] left
[4065.74 → 4067.12] church
[4067.12 → 4067.98] and the Christian
[4067.98 → 4068.42] faith
[4068.42 → 4069.46] is because
[4069.46 → 4070.08] he looked at
[4070.08 → 4070.50] Christians
[4070.50 → 4071.72] and he didn't see
[4071.72 → 4072.30] anything different
[4072.30 → 4072.74] about them.
[4073.88 → 4074.70] They were exactly
[4074.70 → 4075.24] the same
[4075.24 → 4075.90] as every other
[4075.90 → 4077.10] person in his life.
[4077.22 → 4077.84] Nothing really
[4077.84 → 4078.28] changed
[4078.28 → 4079.30] and in fact
[4079.30 → 4080.18] Mike would tell you
[4080.18 → 4081.02] that it's actually
[4081.02 → 4081.64] worse than that
[4081.64 → 4082.30] because he looked
[4082.30 → 4083.14] at those so-called
[4083.14 → 4083.58] Christians
[4083.58 → 4084.90] and they were worse
[4084.90 → 4085.64] than the other
[4085.64 → 4086.66] people in his life.
[4087.68 → 4088.22] They were mean
[4088.22 → 4089.34] and judgmental
[4089.34 → 4090.82] and vindictive
[4090.82 → 4091.74] and in Mike's story
[4091.74 → 4092.74] even abusive.
[4092.74 → 4095.92] So no wonder
[4095.92 → 4098.10] people don't believe.
[4099.28 → 4099.92] It's not about
[4099.92 → 4101.16] an intellectual thing
[4101.16 → 4103.60] it's about a personal thing.
[4104.72 → 4105.52] You've heard me
[4105.52 → 4106.66] quote in the past
[4106.66 → 4108.12] from Jekyll Crow
[4108.12 → 4109.00] who wrote a book
[4109.00 → 4109.32] called
[4109.32 → 4110.32] This Changes Everything
[4110.32 → 4110.98] she wrote this
[4110.98 → 4111.82] when she was 18
[4111.82 → 4113.88] and she says
[4113.88 → 4114.70] that Jesus
[4114.70 → 4115.54] makes people
[4115.54 → 4117.34] 100% new.
[4117.48 → 4117.92] He takes us
[4117.92 → 4118.72] spiritually dead
[4118.72 → 4119.30] and makes us
[4119.30 → 4119.84] thrillingly,
[4119.96 → 4120.34] beautifully,
[4120.60 → 4122.04] abundantly alive.
[4122.04 → 4123.04] Jesus changes
[4123.04 → 4123.90] everything
[4123.90 → 4125.62] with his resurrection
[4125.62 → 4126.78] and now
[4126.78 → 4129.04] everything about you
[4129.04 → 4130.28] changes.
[4131.56 → 4132.38] The Bible says
[4132.38 → 4133.50] you are a new creation.
[4134.56 → 4134.98] The Bible says
[4134.98 → 4135.72] that we have victory
[4135.72 → 4136.98] over sin and death
[4136.98 → 4137.76] because Jesus
[4137.76 → 4139.98] has won the victory.
[4140.52 → 4141.02] The Bible says
[4141.02 → 4141.64] that we have
[4141.64 → 4142.90] a new identity
[4142.90 → 4144.36] as lavishly loved
[4144.36 → 4145.84] children of the Father
[4145.84 → 4146.48] because we are
[4146.48 → 4147.54] heirs of God
[4147.54 → 4148.46] and co-heirs
[4148.46 → 4149.52] with Christ.
[4149.74 → 4151.46] This is who you are
[4151.46 → 4153.22] because of the resurrection.
[4157.42 → 4158.62] Jesus even changes
[4158.62 → 4159.42] the way we read
[4159.42 → 4161.04] and understand the Bible.
[4161.76 → 4163.14] This is our second point.
[4163.24 → 4164.26] This is the witness
[4164.26 → 4165.46] of the resurrection
[4165.46 → 4166.14] and the witness
[4166.14 → 4167.70] to the resurrection.
[4169.38 → 4170.04] Now the disciples
[4170.04 → 4171.68] struggle to understand
[4171.68 → 4172.84] but Jesus
[4172.84 → 4173.90] had been telling them
[4173.90 → 4174.70] all along
[4174.70 → 4175.50] that this is what
[4175.50 → 4175.94] would happen.
[4177.16 → 4177.32] Right?
[4177.66 → 4178.46] Look again
[4178.46 → 4179.46] at this text.
[4179.46 → 4179.98] Text.
[4180.12 → 4180.64] Verse 6.
[4181.08 → 4181.60] The angels say
[4181.60 → 4182.20] he is not here
[4182.20 → 4182.86] he has risen
[4182.86 → 4185.24] remember how he told you
[4185.24 → 4186.38] while he was still
[4186.38 → 4187.38] with you in Galilee.
[4187.96 → 4188.58] The son of man
[4188.58 → 4189.34] must be delivered
[4189.34 → 4191.12] over to the hands
[4191.12 → 4191.48] of sinners
[4191.48 → 4192.06] be crucified
[4192.06 → 4193.16] and on the third day
[4193.16 → 4194.44] be raised again.
[4195.00 → 4195.72] Verse 25.
[4195.84 → 4197.12] He said to the two men
[4197.12 → 4198.02] on the road to Emmaus
[4198.02 → 4198.88] how foolish you are
[4198.88 → 4199.84] and how slow to believe
[4199.84 → 4200.90] all that the prophets
[4200.90 → 4201.38] have spoken
[4201.38 → 4202.50] did not the Messiah
[4202.50 → 4203.32] have to suffer
[4203.32 → 4203.88] these things
[4203.88 → 4205.40] and then enter his glory
[4205.40 → 4205.78] again.
[4206.12 → 4207.16] Jesus has been explaining
[4207.16 → 4208.52] this all along.
[4209.24 → 4209.92] Verse 44.
[4210.10 → 4210.40] He says
[4210.40 → 4211.90] this is what I told you
[4211.90 → 4212.86] while I was still
[4212.86 → 4213.30] with you
[4213.30 → 4214.44] everything must be
[4214.44 → 4214.86] fulfilled
[4214.86 → 4215.52] that is written
[4215.52 → 4216.22] about me
[4216.22 → 4217.44] in the law of Moses
[4217.44 → 4218.24] the prophets
[4218.24 → 4219.22] and the Psalms.
[4219.68 → 4219.76] Right?
[4219.82 → 4220.68] The whole Bible
[4220.68 → 4221.72] has been pointing
[4221.72 → 4222.68] to this day
[4222.68 → 4223.76] to this moment
[4223.76 → 4225.14] to this new creation
[4225.14 → 4225.92] reality
[4225.92 → 4226.88] from the very beginning
[4226.88 → 4227.90] from the first rebellion
[4227.90 → 4228.88] of our first parents
[4228.88 → 4229.44] Adam and Eve
[4229.44 → 4229.96] in the garden
[4229.96 → 4231.08] God comes down
[4231.08 → 4232.08] and he says to them
[4232.08 → 4233.22] that he will send
[4233.22 → 4234.36] a son who will crush
[4234.36 → 4235.58] the head of the serpent
[4235.58 → 4236.88] in Genesis 3.15.
[4236.88 → 4237.98] Psalm 16
[4237.98 → 4239.00] we get the resounding
[4239.00 → 4239.68] chorus that
[4239.68 → 4241.22] God you will not
[4241.22 → 4242.54] let your holy ones
[4242.54 → 4243.62] see decay
[4243.62 → 4245.42] this is the victory
[4245.42 → 4246.00] of God
[4246.00 → 4247.24] that the whole earth
[4247.24 → 4248.44] has been waiting for
[4248.44 → 4249.70] and longing for
[4249.70 → 4252.22] but they couldn't
[4252.22 → 4252.66] see it
[4252.66 → 4254.80] and we can forgive
[4254.80 → 4255.30] them for that
[4255.30 → 4255.48] right?
[4255.54 → 4256.02] Because it is
[4256.02 → 4256.74] extraordinary
[4256.74 → 4258.98] but notice
[4258.98 → 4260.28] in each case
[4260.28 → 4260.80] that they
[4260.80 → 4262.06] couldn't see it
[4262.06 → 4262.76] notice what
[4262.76 → 4264.38] Jesus does
[4264.38 → 4267.00] verse 30
[4267.00 → 4269.58] when he was
[4269.58 → 4270.14] at the table
[4270.14 → 4270.72] with them
[4270.72 → 4272.34] he took bread
[4272.34 → 4273.60] gave thanks
[4273.60 → 4274.76] and broke it
[4274.76 → 4275.54] and began
[4275.54 → 4277.46] give it to them
[4277.46 → 4278.84] their eyes
[4278.84 → 4279.50] were open
[4279.50 → 4281.70] they recognized him
[4281.70 → 4283.76] again in verse 35
[4283.76 → 4285.06] the two told
[4285.06 → 4285.50] what happened
[4285.50 → 4285.84] on the way
[4285.84 → 4286.52] and how Jesus
[4286.52 → 4287.28] was recognized
[4287.28 → 4287.86] by them
[4287.86 → 4288.66] when he broke
[4288.66 → 4289.72] the bread
[4289.72 → 4291.72] verse 41
[4291.72 → 4292.96] and while we still
[4292.96 → 4293.64] did not believe
[4293.64 → 4294.82] it was because of
[4294.82 → 4295.70] joy and amazement
[4295.70 → 4296.30] he asked them
[4296.30 → 4296.90] do you have
[4296.90 → 4297.82] anything to eat
[4297.82 → 4298.66] they gave him
[4298.66 → 4299.16] a piece of
[4299.16 → 4299.68] boiled fish
[4299.68 → 4300.46] and he took it
[4300.46 → 4301.36] and he ate it
[4301.36 → 4302.34] in their presence
[4302.34 → 4303.58] when the disciples
[4303.58 → 4304.82] couldn't see
[4304.82 → 4306.66] what the scriptures
[4306.66 → 4307.70] had told them
[4307.70 → 4308.40] would happen
[4308.40 → 4309.22] all along
[4309.22 → 4309.88] what Jesus
[4309.88 → 4310.90] had told them
[4310.90 → 4311.34] would happen
[4311.34 → 4312.36] over and over again
[4312.36 → 4313.08] when the disciples
[4313.08 → 4313.82] couldn't see it
[4313.82 → 4314.54] when they couldn't
[4314.54 → 4315.24] believe it
[4315.24 → 4316.38] it is confirmed
[4316.38 → 4316.84] for them
[4316.84 → 4318.02] it is made real
[4318.02 → 4318.62] for them
[4318.62 → 4320.20] in the meal
[4320.20 → 4323.14] and this is still true
[4323.14 → 4324.98] whenever we eat
[4324.98 → 4325.60] this bread
[4325.60 → 4327.48] and drink this cup
[4327.48 → 4328.70] we proclaim
[4328.70 → 4329.68] the Lord's death
[4329.68 → 4330.98] and resurrection
[4330.98 → 4332.82] until he comes again
[4332.82 → 4335.60] the truth
[4335.60 → 4336.78] is
[4336.78 → 4338.14] that the death
[4338.14 → 4338.82] of Jesus
[4338.82 → 4340.28] is only meaningful
[4340.28 → 4341.34] only saving
[4341.34 → 4342.24] only atoning
[4342.24 → 4343.24] only propitiating
[4344.02 → 4345.04] only efficacious
[4345.04 → 4345.88] unto salvation
[4345.88 → 4346.98] if the resurrection
[4346.98 → 4347.74] happens
[4347.74 → 4348.96] and at the table
[4348.96 → 4350.64] we meet
[4350.64 → 4351.30] the risen Lord
[4351.30 → 4354.42] and in this season
[4354.42 → 4357.08] we can't come
[4357.08 → 4357.60] to this table
[4357.60 → 4357.98] together
[4357.98 → 4359.26] in the way
[4359.26 → 4359.86] that we would like
[4359.86 → 4361.90] so you have to
[4361.90 → 4363.04] see this bread
[4363.04 → 4364.00] and know
[4364.00 → 4365.78] you have to
[4365.78 → 4366.44] share bread
[4366.44 → 4367.28] with your brothers
[4367.28 → 4367.88] and sisters
[4367.88 → 4369.02] and know
[4369.02 → 4370.18] the table
[4370.18 → 4370.96] we meet
[4370.96 → 4372.16] the risen Lord
[4372.16 → 4372.94] that the tomb
[4372.94 → 4373.92] is
[4373.92 → 4375.02] empty
[4375.02 → 4376.30] Jesus
[4376.30 → 4376.60] Jesus was
[4376.60 → 4377.08] recognized
[4377.08 → 4377.76] by them
[4377.76 → 4378.32] when he
[4378.32 → 4378.96] broke
[4378.96 → 4379.64] the bread
[4379.64 → 4380.26] and every time
[4380.26 → 4381.06] we break
[4381.06 → 4381.56] bread
[4381.56 → 4382.06] together
[4382.06 → 4382.94] we recognize
[4382.94 → 4383.58] Jesus
[4383.58 → 4384.46] because he is
[4384.46 → 4384.80] real
[4384.80 → 4385.40] and he is
[4385.40 → 4386.34] really present
[4386.34 → 4388.06] in this meal
[4388.06 → 4389.02] and in our
[4389.02 → 4389.60] fellowship
[4389.60 → 4390.18] together
[4390.18 → 4391.20] by the Holy Spirit
[4391.20 → 4391.98] Christ is
[4391.98 → 4393.06] really present
[4393.06 → 4393.70] in the bread
[4393.70 → 4394.64] and in the wine
[4394.64 → 4395.24] and when we
[4395.24 → 4396.42] recognize him
[4396.42 → 4397.40] our faith
[4397.40 → 4398.54] is
[4398.54 → 4399.52] nourished
[4399.52 → 4401.30] the meal
[4401.30 → 4402.68] is a witness
[4402.68 → 4404.08] to the resurrection
[4404.08 → 4406.56] but so too
[4406.56 → 4408.04] is your
[4408.04 → 4408.84] transformed
[4408.84 → 4409.98] life
[4409.98 → 4411.48] you
[4411.48 → 4412.86] and how you live
[4412.86 → 4413.46] you
[4413.46 → 4414.26] and how you
[4414.26 → 4414.60] forgive
[4414.60 → 4415.38] you
[4415.38 → 4416.18] and how you
[4416.18 → 4416.80] care for the
[4416.80 → 4417.38] old ladies
[4417.38 → 4418.18] at work
[4418.18 → 4419.04] who like to
[4419.04 → 4419.30] bicker
[4419.30 → 4419.98] when no one
[4419.98 → 4420.38] is looking
[4420.38 → 4421.02] you
[4421.02 → 4421.78] and how you
[4421.78 → 4422.42] seek out
[4422.42 → 4423.06] the ignored
[4423.06 → 4424.00] kid at school
[4424.00 → 4425.02] who will still
[4425.02 → 4425.76] complain even
[4425.76 → 4426.06] when you
[4426.06 → 4426.52] come over
[4426.52 → 4427.04] you
[4427.04 → 4427.90] are a witness
[4427.90 → 4428.68] to the truth
[4428.68 → 4429.64] of the resurrection
[4429.64 → 4430.78] you live
[4430.78 → 4431.50] life
[4431.50 → 4432.50] transformed
[4432.50 → 4433.74] as a witness
[4433.74 → 4434.66] to whom
[4434.66 → 4435.26] Jesus
[4435.26 → 4436.06] is
[4436.06 → 4437.98] you
[4437.98 → 4439.42] are witnesses
[4439.42 → 4440.76] to these things
[4440.76 → 4441.84] Jesus says
[4441.84 → 4443.00] in verse 48
[4443.00 → 4446.30] you
[4446.30 → 4448.22] are a witness
[4448.22 → 4450.04] of the resurrection
[4450.04 → 4451.08] you
[4451.08 → 4452.08] prove
[4452.08 → 4452.56] this
[4452.56 → 4453.26] is
[4453.26 → 4454.06] real
[4454.06 → 4457.24] finally
[4457.24 → 4457.68] because
[4457.68 → 4458.38] Jesus
[4458.38 → 4458.88] changed
[4458.88 → 4459.46] everything
[4459.46 → 4459.86] everything
[4459.86 → 4460.36] about
[4460.36 → 4460.74] you
[4460.74 → 4461.42] changes
[4461.42 → 4461.96] and that
[4461.96 → 4462.30] means
[4462.30 → 4462.58] you
[4462.58 → 4463.02] have
[4463.02 → 4463.80] a mission
[4463.80 → 4465.34] you
[4465.34 → 4466.10] are a new
[4466.10 → 4466.66] creation
[4466.66 → 4467.58] with a new
[4467.58 → 4468.12] creation
[4468.12 → 4468.84] life
[4468.84 → 4469.34] you are
[4469.34 → 4470.12] a living
[4470.12 → 4470.92] resurrection
[4470.92 → 4471.68] life
[4471.68 → 4472.74] right now
[4472.74 → 4473.76] raised
[4473.76 → 4474.52] from the
[4474.52 → 4474.86] dead
[4474.86 → 4475.18] in
[4475.18 → 4476.08] being dead
[4476.08 → 4476.82] in trespasses
[4476.82 → 4477.32] and sins
[4477.32 → 4477.70] you
[4477.70 → 4478.14] know
[4478.14 → 4478.78] life
[4478.78 → 4479.50] from
[4479.50 → 4479.94] Jesus
[4479.94 → 4480.42] and now
[4480.42 → 4480.90] for
[4480.90 → 4481.66] Jesus
[4481.66 → 4482.78] resurrection
[4482.78 → 4483.58] life
[4483.58 → 4484.00] is a
[4484.00 → 4484.40] is a
[4484.40 → 4484.84] scent
[4484.84 → 4485.16] life
[4485.16 → 4485.52] that is
[4485.52 → 4486.18] fuelled
[4486.18 → 4487.00] by the
[4487.00 → 4487.44] witness
[4487.44 → 4488.04] of word
[4488.04 → 4488.70] and sacrament
[4488.70 → 4489.16] to a
[4489.16 → 4489.48] world
[4489.48 → 4489.86] that is
[4489.86 → 4490.60] mired
[4490.60 → 4491.20] in death
[4491.20 → 4491.98] and darkness
[4491.98 → 4493.74] resurrection
[4493.74 → 4494.34] life
[4494.34 → 4494.78] is a
[4494.78 → 4495.08] scent
[4495.08 → 4495.52] life
[4495.52 → 4496.06] fuelled
[4496.06 → 4496.42] by the
[4496.42 → 4496.64] witness
[4496.64 → 4496.94] of the
[4496.94 → 4497.28] word
[4497.28 → 4498.48] sacrament
[4498.48 → 4499.00] to a
[4499.00 → 4499.30] world
[4499.30 → 4499.92] of death
[4499.92 → 4501.40] darkness
[4501.40 → 4502.40] but
[4502.40 → 4504.20] we do
[4504.20 → 4505.06] not
[4505.06 → 4505.94] go
[4505.94 → 4507.06] home
[4507.06 → 4509.36] Jesus
[4509.36 → 4509.64] says
[4509.64 → 4509.96] stay
[4509.96 → 4510.40] in the

[4958.40 → 4964.08] Hi kids, come back up, come back up.
[4964.26 → 4966.38] We're ready for the second part of the story.
[4966.88 → 4971.72] If you heard that song, you probably have a really, huge clue what the second part is.
[4971.78 → 4973.12] But let's just read it together.
[4973.56 → 4977.46] Because we know that the story wasn't over when Jesus died.
[4978.38 → 4983.10] So very early on Sunday morning, the ground began to rumble.
[4983.20 → 4984.24] It was another earthquake.
[4984.24 → 4989.82] Then a bright angel came down from heaven and rolled away that big stone.
[4990.44 → 4992.02] The angel sat right on top.
[4993.00 → 4995.32] The soldiers at the tomb, well, they were terrified.
[4995.76 → 4996.46] What was happening?
[4997.52 → 5003.68] At that very moment, some of Jesus' friends, they were on their way to put more of those spices onto his body.
[5004.30 → 5006.34] So many thoughts were going through their mind.
[5006.78 → 5009.18] How were they going to move that giant stone?
[5009.74 → 5011.02] What if they couldn't move it?
[5011.02 → 5014.08] Well, were they ever surprised when they arrived?
[5014.16 → 5016.84] When they came to the tomb, the stone was already rolled.
[5017.34 → 5018.70] The tomb was open.
[5020.64 → 5022.82] Sitting on the stone was a bright angel.
[5023.24 → 5026.04] It was a terrifying sight, and the women, they were frightened.
[5027.10 → 5029.28] Don't be afraid, the angel said kindly.
[5029.90 → 5032.76] I know you're looking for Jesus, but he's not here.
[5032.88 → 5034.00] He has risen.
[5034.50 → 5035.32] He's alive.
[5035.48 → 5036.46] Come see for yourself.
[5036.46 → 5042.54] Let's take a look at our crescent roll here that we did.
[5042.70 → 5043.58] Hopefully you can see it.
[5043.64 → 5045.20] Oh, it's stuck a little tiny bit.
[5045.30 → 5046.52] Can you see what's inside?
[5046.62 → 5047.80] What happened to that marshmallow?
[5048.04 → 5048.80] Is it in there?
[5049.68 → 5050.36] It's gone.
[5050.96 → 5051.70] Completely gone.
[5051.80 → 5052.60] So it's empty.
[5052.80 → 5053.76] The cloths are empty.
[5053.92 → 5055.30] The cloths were folded.
[5055.96 → 5056.88] Put it back there.
[5059.08 → 5060.62] The women looked at each other.
[5060.70 → 5061.62] How could that be?
[5061.74 → 5062.62] Was this true?
[5062.62 → 5068.18] The women were amazed, and they hurried off to obey the angel and to spread the news.
[5068.30 → 5069.72] It's wonderful, said Mary.
[5070.12 → 5071.70] Jesus is alive.
[5072.06 → 5072.58] Alive.
[5073.48 → 5075.68] Suddenly, there was Jesus himself.
[5076.44 → 5079.04] Mary, Magdalene, and the other Mary, they ran to him.
[5079.12 → 5080.30] They fell at his feet.
[5080.92 → 5082.40] All they could think of was Jesus.
[5083.34 → 5084.14] It was true.
[5084.28 → 5085.64] Jesus was alive.
[5086.00 → 5089.00] He was standing right in front of them, talking to them.
[5089.52 → 5090.04] Alive.
[5090.04 → 5095.06] Now, my friend, said Jesus, go and tell my disciples that I am alive.
[5096.02 → 5097.28] What an amazing thing.
[5097.46 → 5098.24] Jesus died.
[5098.62 → 5101.56] But now, Jesus lives for us.
[5101.96 → 5102.86] And it's true.
[5103.16 → 5104.16] All true.
[5111.28 → 5111.84] Amen.
[5111.84 → 5112.02] Amen.
[5112.68 → 5117.28] Thank you for worshipping with us this Easter Sunday morning.
[5117.28 → 5124.86] As you go into this week, regardless of what the week has in store for you, know that God himself goes with you.
[5124.94 → 5127.82] And so, receive his blessing.
[5129.50 → 5132.16] May God go before you to lead you.
[5133.22 → 5135.36] May God go behind you to guard you.
[5136.18 → 5138.34] May God go beneath you to support you.
[5138.52 → 5141.22] And may God go beside you to befriend you.
[5141.52 → 5142.92] Do not be afraid.
[5143.16 → 5144.38] He is alive.
[5144.38 → 5146.74] Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[5146.86 → 5148.24] Do not be afraid.
[5148.64 → 5150.54] He is alive.
[5151.50 → 5151.80] Go.
[5152.76 → 5153.66] In peace.
[5154.70 → 5157.60] To love and serve our risen Lord.
[5158.56 → 5158.92] Amen.
[5158.92 → 5159.04] Amen.
[5159.04 → 5159.08] Amen.
[5159.08 → 5159.10] Amen.
[5159.10 → 5159.14] Amen.

[5169.14 → 5170.14] Amen.
[5170.14 → 5171.14] Amen.
[5171.14 → 5172.14] Amen.
[5172.14 → 5172.20] Amen.
[5172.20 → 5172.24] Amen.
[5174.38 → 5177.88] Amen.
[5177.88 → 5177.96] Amen.
[5178.12 → 5178.40] Amen.
[5178.40 → 5180.06] Amen.
[5186.44 → 5186.50] Amen.
[5188.60 → 5188.98] Amen.
[5188.98 → 5195.86] One day when heaven was filled with his praises
[5195.86 → 5201.62] One day when sin was as black as could be
[5201.62 → 5208.10] Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin
[5208.10 → 5213.94] Dwelt among men, my example is he
[5213.94 → 5221.14] The word became flesh and the light shined among us
[5221.14 → 5223.94] His glory revealed
[5223.94 → 5230.50] Living he loved me, dying he saved me
[5230.50 → 5236.38] Married he carried my sins far away
[5236.38 → 5242.54] Rising he justified freely forever
[5242.54 → 5249.02] One day he's coming, oh glorious day
[5249.02 → 5251.54] Glorious day
[5251.54 → 5267.82] One day they led him to Calvary's mountain
[5267.82 → 5273.62] One day they nailed him to die on a tree
[5273.62 → 5280.10] Suffering anguish, despised and rejected
[5280.10 → 5285.62] Burying our sins, our redeemer is he
[5285.62 → 5292.10] The hand that healed nations stretched out on a tree
[5292.10 → 5296.10] And took the nails for me
[5296.10 → 5302.10] Living he loved me, dying he saved me
[5302.10 → 5307.10] Buried he carried my sins far away
[5307.10 → 5313.10] Rising he justified freely forever
[5313.10 → 5319.58] One day he's coming, oh glorious day
[5319.58 → 5335.58] One day the grave could conceal him no longer
[5335.58 → 5336.58] One day the grave could conceal him no longer
[5336.58 → 5337.58] One day the grave could conceal him no longer
[5337.58 → 5338.58] One day the grave could conceal him no longer
[5338.58 → 5342.06] One day the storm rolled away from the door
[5342.06 → 5347.58] Then he arose, oh, for death he had conquered
[5347.58 → 5352.58] Now he's ascended my lord evermore
[5352.58 → 5354.06] Now he's ascended my lord evermore
[5354.06 → 5356.06] The death could not hold him
[5356.06 → 5358.06] The grave could not hold him
[5358.06 → 5359.06] The grave could not keep him
[5359.06 → 5361.06] The grave could not keep him
[5361.06 → 5363.06] Rising again
[5363.06 → 5370.06] Living he loved me, dying he saved me
[5370.06 → 5375.06] Buried he carried my sins far away
[5375.06 → 5382.06] Rising he justified freely forever
[5382.06 → 5388.06] One day he's coming, oh glorious day
[5388.06 → 5392.06] Oh glorious day
[5392.06 → 5394.06] Oh glorious day
[5394.06 → 5398.06] Oh glorious day
[5398.06 → 5403.06] One day
[5403.06 → 5408.06] One day the trumpet will sound for his coming
[5408.06 → 5414.06] One day the skies with his glories will shine
[5414.06 → 5420.06] Wonderful day my beloved one bringing
[5420.06 → 5424.06] My saviour Jesus is mine
[5424.06 → 5431.06] Living he loved me, dying he saved me
[5431.06 → 5437.06] Buried he carried my sins far away
[5437.06 → 5443.06] Rising he justified freely forever
[5443.06 → 5449.06] One day he's coming, oh glorious day
[5449.06 → 5453.06] glorious day
[5453.06 → 5455.06] Glorious day
[5455.06 → 5458.06] Oh glorious day
[5458.06 → 5459.06] Oh glorious day
[5459.06 → 5463.06] Oh glorious day
[5463.06 → 5464.06] Oh glorious day
[5465.06 → 5466.06] Glorious day
[5466.06 → 5469.06] Oh glorious day
[5469.06 → 5474.14] GL Vide ogle
[5479.06 → 5496.62] I raise a hallelujah in the presence of my enemies.
[5498.62 → 5502.48] I raise a hallelujah.
[5503.48 → 5504.10] Come on.
[5504.10 → 5509.10] Louder than the unbelief.
[5510.36 → 5514.16] I raise a hallelujah.
[5516.32 → 5519.78] My weapon is a melody.
[5522.92 → 5525.92] I raise a hallelujah.
[5528.92 → 5532.10] Heaven comes to fight for me.
[5534.10 → 5540.14] And I'm going to sing in the living of the storm.
[5541.02 → 5543.12] Louder and louder.
[5543.56 → 5546.54] You're going to hear my praises roar.
[5547.06 → 5551.10] Up from the ashes, hope will run.
[5552.76 → 5554.10] Death is defeated.
[5555.54 → 5557.10] The King is alive.
[5557.10 → 5559.88] Yeah, come on.
[5562.88 → 5565.32] Come on, your King is alive today.
[5567.16 → 5569.78] I raise a hallelujah.
[5572.78 → 5575.78] With everything inside of me.
[5575.78 → 5581.50] I raise a hallelujah.
[5581.50 → 5588.42] I will watch the darkness bleed.
[5589.42 → 5593.22] I raise a hallelujah.
[5593.22 → 5599.02] Oh, in the middle of the mystery.
[5602.24 → 5604.86] I raise a hallelujah.
[5605.60 → 5605.96] Teared.
[5607.82 → 5611.36] Oh, fear you lost, you hold on me.
[5611.66 → 5612.42] Sing it out!
[5612.42 → 5619.12] I'm going to sing in the middle of the storm
[5619.12 → 5625.10] And louder and louder, you're going to hear my praises roll
[5625.10 → 5631.02] Up from the ashes, hope will arise
[5631.02 → 5636.78] Death is defeated, the King is alive
[5642.42 → 5659.84] Sing a little louder
[5659.84 → 5665.34] work
[5665.34 → 5671.34] Sing a little louder
[5671.34 → 5677.34] Sing a little louder
[5677.34 → 5680.94] Impressions of my enemy
[5680.94 → 5683.34] Sing a little louder
[5683.34 → 5687.34] Louder than the unbelief
[5687.34 → 5689.34] Sing a little louder
[5689.34 → 5692.54] My weapon is a melody
[5692.54 → 5694.84] Sing a little louder
[5694.84 → 5698.84] Heaven comes to fight for me
[5698.84 → 5700.84] Sing a little louder

[5722.84 → 5724.84] Sing a little louder
[5724.84 → 5726.84] I'm going to sing
[5726.84 → 5730.84] In the middle of the storm
[5730.84 → 5732.84] And louder and louder
[5732.84 → 5736.84] You're going to hear my praises roar
[5736.84 → 5738.84] Up from the ashes
[5738.84 → 5742.84] Hope will arise
[5742.84 → 5744.84] Death is defeated
[5744.84 → 5746.84] Death is defeated
[5746.84 → 5748.84] The King is alive
[5748.84 → 5750.84] And I'm going to sing
[5750.84 → 5752.84] In the middle of the storm
[5752.84 → 5754.84] And louder and louder
[5754.84 → 5759.96] Lighter in the light, you're going to hear my praises roar.
[5759.96 → 5766.02] Up from the eyes, hope will arise.
[5766.14 → 5771.96] Let this exceed in, the King is alive.
[5774.66 → 5777.58] I'm raising, hallelujah.
[5780.14 → 5783.44] I'm raising, hallelujah.
[5784.84 → 5789.34] All praise, hallelujah
[5789.34 → 5795.16] All praise, hallelujah
