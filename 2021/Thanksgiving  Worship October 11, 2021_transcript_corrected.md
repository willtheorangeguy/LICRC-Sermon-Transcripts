[1949.58 → 1979.56] Thank you.
[1979.58 → 2009.56] Thank you.
[2009.58 → 2039.56] We're going to read that.
[2039.58 → 2069.56] Don't look over there.
[2069.56 → 2099.54] Thank you.
[2099.56 → 2129.54] A day to slow down.
[2129.54 → 2159.54] And to give you.
[2159.54 → 2189.52] And answer one.
[2189.54 → 2219.54] Thank you.
[2219.54 → 2249.52] Thank you.
[2249.54 → 2279.52] So with that.
[2279.52 → 2309.52] Thank you.
[2309.52 → 2339.50] Now, thanks, you know,
[2339.50 → 2369.48] when you have something,
[2369.48 → 2399.48] and we'll see you.
[2399.48 → 2429.46] giving glory.
[2429.46 → 2459.44] And so, you know, it's our, you know,
[2459.46 → 2489.44] we'll see you.
[2489.44 → 2497.22] gallows or to the stake with their head held high. Or how Christians from parts of the world where
[2497.22 → 2504.10] persecution is every day, and even if they happen to escape those parts of the world and get out,
[2504.38 → 2511.54] they want to go back because they consider it a pure joy to suffer for the sake of the gospel
[2511.54 → 2519.30] and to share in Christ's afflictions. It's because they get this. They understand Nehemiah's
[2519.30 → 2526.74] words when he told the people, this day is holy to the Lord. Do not grieve for the joy of the Lord is
[2526.74 → 2534.60] our strength. Worship is the mission of the Christian and of the church, and worship is
[2534.60 → 2545.62] fundamentally Thanksgiving to God, which then takes us to the second part. Giving thanks to God,
[2545.62 → 2552.00] Christian evangelism as our mission. Now, evangelism is the word that we use in the church
[2552.00 → 2559.18] that means preach the gospel, preach the good news. The Christian mission is to preach the gospel so
[2559.18 → 2567.28] that people will come to know God. Verse 3, know that the Lord is God. It is he who made us, and we are
[2567.28 → 2579.74] his. We are his people, the sheep of his pasture. Know that the Lord is God. But how will they know
[2579.74 → 2588.82] unless someone tells them? Now, in the Hebrew language, the language that this psalm was first written in,
[2588.82 → 2600.80] know isn't just a suggestion. It's a command, right? Know that the Lord is God. But also, the word for
[2600.80 → 2609.04] know in Hebrew isn't just about knowledge, right? It isn't just about the fact that the Lord is God. I
[2609.04 → 2616.80] mean, it is that, and it's true, but it's also more, right? Know in the Bible means something deeper than
[2616.80 → 2624.72] information. And so, you might come across a line that says something like, Abraham knew Sarah,
[2624.92 → 2630.52] and she was with child. Jacob knew Rachel, and she gave birth to a son.
[2632.40 → 2635.54] Now, that's more than knowing facts about someone.
[2637.74 → 2641.42] If you don't know how that's more than knowing facts about someone, talk to your parents.
[2641.42 → 2650.50] Right? It's obviously more than a simple knowing, but it's the same word, right? The knowing that we
[2650.50 → 2658.16] are talking about here is fundamentally a knowing of relationship, of intimacy, of union, and fellowship,
[2658.56 → 2667.44] and covenanting, promising together. That's how God wants you to know Him, in relationship to Him.
[2667.44 → 2675.88] And for that to happen, the people who already know Him have to tell about Him. And that's ultimately
[2675.88 → 2681.34] what Romans 10 is about, when Paul there writes, and how can they believe in the one of whom they
[2681.34 → 2686.38] have not heard, and how can they hear without someone preaching to them, and how can anyone preach
[2686.38 → 2696.64] unless they are sent? But you see, there's not only a command here. There is a promise, right?
[2696.64 → 2705.00] Know that the Lord is God. That's the command. It is He who made us, and we are His. We are His people,
[2705.16 → 2715.00] the sheep of His pasture. That's the promise. In John 10, Jesus tells us that He is the Good Shepherd,
[2715.22 → 2723.00] and that He knows His sheep, and His sheep know His voice. When you go out to preach the good news,
[2723.00 → 2729.74] the sheep of the Good Shepherd will hear His voice in you, from you, and through you, and will respond.
[2730.52 → 2736.44] That's a promise you can count on. Thanksgiving as Christian mission means that we must go out
[2736.44 → 2746.56] and proclaim this good news. And His people will know. His people will hear. And His people will come.
[2746.56 → 2754.70] And so then the third part of Christian mission as Thanksgiving. Give thanks to the Lord,
[2755.28 → 2760.10] mercy, and justice as our mission. Verse 4 says,
[2760.54 → 2768.16] enter His gates with Thanksgiving and His courts with praise. Give thanks to Him and praise His name.
[2768.16 → 2773.80] Now, this is an image of the temple. Now, this is an image of the temple. And for the Jewish people,
[2774.30 → 2783.38] the temple was the seat of religious and cultural and, for a significant period of time, judicial life.
[2784.64 → 2790.98] Enter His gates with Thanksgiving and His courts with praise conjures up images of
[2790.98 → 2801.42] the ruling seat of God. The temple is the place of God's residing and His decreeing and His judgments
[2801.42 → 2809.70] echo out from there to the corners of the earth. It is a place of justice and rule and kingship. And so,
[2810.50 → 2815.96] as I read this psalm, I can't help but extrapolate out from that image a connection
[2815.96 → 2823.90] to the kingdom of God as it comes in Jesus. Jesus, who said, behold, the kingdom of God is at hand.
[2824.22 → 2830.54] Jesus, who said, destroy this temple and in three days I will rebuild it. And when John is recording
[2830.54 → 2835.14] that, he has a little commentary on the end. He says, after the resurrection, the disciples figured
[2835.14 → 2843.16] out that He was talking about the temple of His body. You see, the kingdom of God changes with Jesus.
[2843.16 → 2852.40] Jesus becomes the temple in our midst. Jesus fulfills everything that the temple stood for.
[2853.16 → 2860.78] And so, from the throne room of God right down to the sacrifices offered, Jesus is the fulfillment.
[2862.54 → 2867.80] And then here's the thing, right? Because the New Testament keeps going with this image. The New
[2867.80 → 2872.96] Testament tells us that we, as Christians, because of the Holy Spirit who lives in us by grace,
[2873.16 → 2882.00] through faith, that we have received Jesus, we are now temples of God. You are a temple. And that means,
[2882.92 → 2891.62] right, follow that line through, that you are the place where God and His reign in the world is revealed
[2891.62 → 2900.72] from, is exercised from. You, your hearts, are the throne room of God, right? It's through the church
[2900.72 → 2909.80] that God reveals His kingdom ethic. And so, the church becomes the agents of God's kingdom in the world,
[2909.80 → 2916.50] right? By subverting and overcoming injustice and bringing justice, by lifting the poor and
[2916.50 → 2924.92] the marginalized, right? Not just of the church, but for the whole world, right? If God's kingdom will one
[2924.92 → 2932.28] day be revealed and fulfilled in the entire world, we, the church, live as if that day is today.
[2933.84 → 2939.88] And so now, every square inch of our lives and work and school and play and families and friends
[2939.88 → 2946.52] and hobbies belong to Him and are used for His purposes and the glory of His name.
[2946.52 → 2957.50] But I also can't help but think of the temple and seeing it as the place of God's mercy, right? Because
[2957.50 → 2963.18] here, sacrifices are made for the forgiveness of sins. Here, mercy is offered to the widow and to
[2963.18 → 2969.66] the poor and to the orphan. And so, the church isn't just about seeking justice, right, an equal
[2969.66 → 2976.04] opportunity for everyone. The church is about providing mercy. It's about giving people what
[2976.04 → 2982.60] they don't strictly deserve or not giving them what they do deserve, right? We don't repay evil for evil.
[2982.90 → 2991.04] Instead, we turn the other cheek. We walk the extra mile. We give our cloak and our coat. Our mercy is
[2991.04 → 3001.74] sacrificial because God's mercy required a sacrifice. To live God's mission, we seek justice and offer
[3001.74 → 3013.70] mercy. That is our Thanksgiving. And finally, the fourth aspect of Christian mission as Thanksgiving or
[3013.70 → 3022.90] Thanksgiving mission, give thanks to the Lord charity as our mission. This is verse 5. For the Lord is good
[3022.90 → 3031.76] and His love endures forever. His faithfulness continues through all generations. Now, first, a word about
[3031.76 → 3038.52] charity. Because some of you hear the word charity, and then you immediately go back to the word mercy.
[3038.52 → 3044.50] charity. I'm not using the word charity in the way that you might be thinking. Not in the way that we
[3044.50 → 3049.58] often use it today where it talks about giving, right? A charity event is one that's offered to raise
[3049.58 → 3055.54] money for some kind. I just played in a charity golf tournament a little while ago. Sometimes you'll hear
[3055.54 → 3060.80] people say something like, I don't need your charity, right, when you're trying to offer them help of
[3060.80 → 3066.88] some sort. When I'm using the word charity here, I'm using it in the more classical sense of the word,
[3066.88 → 3075.28] where it means love. Jonathan Edwards was an 18th century Christian pastor and theologian. He's one
[3075.28 → 3081.56] of my favourite historical pastors, preachers. He has a series of sermons on 1 Corinthians 13.
[3082.72 → 3087.02] Now, if you don't immediately understand that, 1 Corinthians 13 is that text that you hear at
[3087.02 → 3093.42] weddings, right? Even Hollywood movies depicting weddings will quote it, love is patient, love is kind,
[3093.42 → 3101.00] it does not envy, it does not boast. Jonathan Edwards has a series of sermons on 1 Corinthians 13 called
[3101.00 → 3109.36] charity and its fruits. That's what I mean when I say the word charity, right? A 1 Corinthians 13
[3109.36 → 3116.94] kind of love. So verse 5 says, the Lord is good and his love endures forever.
[3116.94 → 3125.90] Now, in Hebrew, that word love is one that you might be familiar with. It's heed. Now, it's sometimes
[3125.90 → 3133.14] translated loyal love or unconditional love. It's God's love for his people, closely connected to
[3133.14 → 3140.30] the idea of God's covenant to them. Because God has made a promise to them to be their God and they to be
[3140.30 → 3146.62] his people. He loves them, and he is loyal to that promise, right? In no small part because God is
[3146.62 → 3153.58] loyal to himself, he is true to his character and his word. And so, when God says that he will love you,
[3154.00 → 3160.64] he will love you because he's promised to love you. That's heed, that's charity. The love that he has for
[3160.64 → 3168.78] his people ultimately is not contingent upon our deserving it or my goodness or my ability to earn it or yours.
[3168.78 → 3176.70] God loves you because he loves you because he promised to love you. And here's the thing,
[3177.24 → 3184.64] as Christians who give thanks to God for that heed, that loyal covenant love, that charity,
[3184.96 → 3192.62] we too are called to live that same love and share that same charity. Christian mission is defined
[3192.62 → 3200.68] by charity. It's because of love that we go out into the world. It's because of love that we preach
[3200.68 → 3206.22] the gospel. It's because of love that we sing his praises. Furthermore, it's because of love that we seek justice and
[3206.22 → 3212.92] love mercy, right? Love covers over and courses through all the aspects of Thanksgiving as Christian
[3212.92 → 3218.62] mission. We worship in love. We evangelize in love. Furthermore, we seek justice and offer mercy in love. Furthermore, we love because
[3218.62 → 3228.94] we are loved. Jesus says, a new commandment I give to you that you love one another. Just as I have loved
[3228.94 → 3238.56] you, you also are to love one another. Just as I have loved you, Jesus says, you are to love one another.
[3238.66 → 3246.14] The love of God for his people enduring forever is the type of love that you and I are to model
[3246.14 → 3260.30] and practice in the world. God is love, says 1 John 4. Whoever lives in love lives in God and God in them.
[3261.58 → 3269.00] Right? You just cannot separate God's love for you from the type of love that you are called to show.
[3269.72 → 3274.50] Jesus makes this point when he summarizes the teaching of all the law and the prophets, and he's relating
[3274.50 → 3279.70] God to that love of neighbour. He says, love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul
[3279.70 → 3284.58] and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment and the second is like it.
[3284.72 → 3291.34] Love your neighbour as yourself. And so if you love God and say you love God, you must also love your
[3291.34 → 3300.30] neighbour. Charity, love is the mission of the Christian. That's how we give thanks to God.
[3300.30 → 3309.74] And so this Thanksgiving Monday, see just how big Thanksgiving for the Christian really is.
[3310.66 → 3317.42] Thanksgiving to God is the mission of the church. A Christian who is thankful to God will show it in
[3317.42 → 3322.74] worship. A Christian who is thankful to God will share it in evangelism. A Christian who is thankful to
[3322.74 → 3328.66] God will share it and will live it in pursuit of justice and mercy. And a Christian who is thankful
[3328.66 → 3337.32] to God will share it in loyal love, chased love, in charity for God and for the world.
[3340.14 → 3348.86] That's what Thanksgiving means to us. And it's so much better than bacon fried Brussels spouts
[3348.86 → 3358.86] and so much better especially than pumpkin spice lattes. And I think to that we can all say
[3358.86 → 3362.56] amen. Good job. Let's pray together.
[3365.24 → 3369.00] Lord our God, we give you thanks.
[3369.00 → 3376.70] We give you thanks for the way that you have revealed yourself to us, and we give you thanks
[3376.70 → 3380.44] for the way that you now send us out to reveal you to the world.
[3382.92 → 3391.22] And so Lord God, may our worship be thanksgiving. May our evangelism, our proclaiming the goodness of God,
[3391.22 → 3399.06] God be thanksgiving. May our seeking justice and loving mercy be Thanksgiving.
[3401.38 → 3408.56] And may our charity, our love for you and love for one another be our Thanksgiving.
[3410.22 → 3416.38] Whatever it is that we do today, may we do it for the glory of your name.
[3416.38 → 3424.94] May we know your love. In Christ Jesus we pray. Amen.
[3446.38 → 3465.38] Jesus Christ, I think upon your sacrifice, you became worthy, poured out to death.
[3465.38 → 3467.38] Amen.
[3467.38 → 3476.74] Many times I've wondered at your gift of life, and I'm in that place once again.
[3479.38 → 3483.38] I'm in that place once again.
[3486.08 → 3492.38] Once again I look upon the cross where you died.
[3492.38 → 3498.38] I'm humbled by your mercy, and I'm broken inside.
[3499.38 → 3502.56] Once again I thank you.
[3503.38 → 3507.38] Once again I pour out my love.
[3513.38 → 3519.76] Now you are exalted to the highest grace.
[3519.76 → 3522.70] King of the heavens, King of the heavens,
[3522.70 → 3525.94] King of the heavens, where one day I'll bow.
[3526.76 → 3533.04] But for now I marvel at this saving grace.
[3533.44 → 3536.76] I'm full of praise once again.
[3538.76 → 3543.76] I'm full of praise once again.
[3543.76 → 3550.76] Once again I look upon the cross where you died.
[3550.76 → 3551.76] Once again I look upon the cross where you died.
[3551.76 → 3556.76] I'm humbled by your mercy, and I'm broken inside.
[3556.76 → 3558.76] Once again I thank you.
[3558.76 → 3562.76] Once again I pour out my love.
[3562.76 → 3569.76] Once again I pour out my love.
[3569.76 → 3575.76] Thank you for the cross.
[3575.76 → 3579.76] Thank you for the cross.
[3579.76 → 3584.76] Thank you for the cross, my friend.
[3584.76 → 3585.76] Thank you for the cross.
[3585.76 → 3586.76] Thank you for the cross.
[3586.76 → 3591.76] Thank you for the cross, my friend.
[3591.76 → 3596.76] Thank you for the cross, my friend.
[3596.76 → 3601.76] Once again I look upon the cross where you died.
[3601.76 → 3613.76] I'm humbled by your mercy, and I'm broken inside.
[3613.76 → 3616.76] Once again I thank you.
[3616.76 → 3620.76] Once again I pour out my love.
[3620.76 → 3644.76] As you go now I invite you to go with the blessing of our God that we might together live lives of thanksgiving mission for him.
[3645.76 → 3648.76] Receive the blessing of our God.
[3648.76 → 3651.76] May God go before you to lead you.
[3651.76 → 3654.76] May God go behind you to protect you.
[3654.76 → 3658.76] May God go beneath you to support you.
[3658.76 → 3661.76] May God go beside you to befriend you.
[3661.76 → 3663.76] Do not be afraid.
