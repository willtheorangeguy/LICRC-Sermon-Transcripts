[2681.94 → 2711.94] We pray.
[2711.94 → 2741.94] Thank you.
[2741.94 → 2771.94] Thank you.
[2771.94 → 2801.94] Thank you.
[2801.94 → 2831.92] God bless you.
[2831.94 → 2832.94] Thank you.
[2861.94 → 2862.94] Thank you.
[2891.94 → 2921.94] Thank you.
[2921.94 → 2951.92] Thank you.
[2951.94 → 2981.94] Thank you.
[2981.94 → 3011.94] Thank you.
[3011.94 → 3012.94] What's the point.
[3012.94 → 3041.92] What's the point.
[3041.94 → 3042.06] 
[3071.94 → 3075.22] when people say, you know, it just doesn't do anything for me.
[3077.18 → 3080.80] And I think part of the reason I get frustrated with that is because I get it.
[3082.08 → 3089.76] What is the point? Why are we here? Now, asking that question at a time like this is really
[3089.76 → 3095.92] interesting, right? Because we've been in this last almost two years in this weird,
[3095.92 → 3104.00] changing circumstances of ability to gather as worship because of COVID, right? And we've spent
[3104.00 → 3113.74] time figuring out how to do worship well at home from our living rooms, on couches, or wherever you
[3113.74 → 3121.44] held your phone and participated in the live stream. And for some of us, right, engaging in worship that
[3121.44 → 3128.18] way was really, really hard, right? Almost impossible. And so, when we had the chance to
[3128.18 → 3132.76] come back like this, we took it immediately, and we were here, and we were front row. Thanks, ladies.
[3137.04 → 3145.18] For others of us, that experience of worship turned into a sort of apathy and laziness, and
[3145.18 → 3148.34] I mean, I don't even have to say it because they're not listening.
[3148.34 → 3154.82] But you know who they are, and you felt that temptation in your own life.
[3156.44 → 3157.56] Why are we here?
[3159.96 → 3165.86] I phrased that question by way of introduction to this message because I think, I mean, there's
[3165.86 → 3172.10] multiple reasons, and many of them are good, some of them are less good, but there is one reason
[3172.10 → 3179.84] why we are here, ultimately. And I think Isaiah is introducing us to that reason.
[3181.92 → 3192.98] And so, this text from Isaiah in verse 4 through 9 of chapter 50 is the third of the Isaiah servant
[3192.98 → 3201.56] songs. And so, there are four chapters or sections of Isaiah that are called the servant songs.
[3201.56 → 3211.28] Isaiah 42 is one, Isaiah 49, 1 through 7 is one, here this text, and then Isaiah 53 is one. And they are
[3211.28 → 3222.14] given to reveal the servant redeemer of God's chosen people, right? And he's revealed to us in these pages
[3222.14 → 3229.22] as personally innocent, we see that in our text, but nonetheless willing to suffer pain and shame for the
[3229.22 → 3236.24] people that he saves. And he's able to do this because his help, his vindication, his strength come
[3236.24 → 3244.96] from above. So, as we dig into this text, we're going to structure it loosely around the name phrase
[3244.96 → 3251.84] that's there. So, if you've got your Bibles open, you will see four times in these verses the name
[3251.84 → 3259.72] phrase, sovereign Lord, is used. And then that name phrase isn't used in any of the other servant songs.
[3260.28 → 3265.72] And so, I think it's fitting that we draw that out and highlight it here because that seems to be what Isaiah
[3265.72 → 3273.70] wants us to do. We're going to use it as a guide then to understand who this servant is, how he changes our life
[3273.70 → 3283.56] in the world through the word, and then why we are here today. Now, in the first place, the sovereign Lord,
[3283.74 → 3292.50] we read, has given me a well-instructed tongue to know the word that sustains the weary. That little phrase,
[3292.78 → 3300.50] well-instructed tongue, translates a Hebrew phrase. This was originally written in Hebrew. That means
[3300.50 → 3309.06] a discipled tongue or a discipling tongue. It literally means a tongue that is taught. One
[3309.06 → 3315.30] translator that I read this week suggested that we translate that instead of well-instructed, but as
[3315.30 → 3323.32] a teacher's tongue, right? The servant has a teacher's tongue, or you might say a preacher's tongue
[3323.32 → 3332.02] that gives life and not death. And the task of the servant really is a prophetic one because God
[3332.02 → 3341.16] speaks life. God creates the world by speaking his word. His word brings life. In the most beautiful
[3341.16 → 3347.84] illustration of this truth, you get the story out of Ezekiel 36 and 37. Maybe you're familiar with it.
[3347.84 → 3354.36] Ezekiel is another prophet, and God takes him to this valley of dry bones, right, where an old army has
[3354.36 → 3361.00] fallen down, and before him are just all countless skeletal corpses. And God says to Ezekiel,
[3361.30 → 3369.80] Ezekiel, preach to these dry bones and they will live. And Ezekiel preaches, and the spirit wind blows,
[3370.10 → 3376.08] and in this beautiful text, the joints start re-articulating together, and he preaches again, and sinew and
[3376.08 → 3383.28] muscle forms, and he preaches, and the word of God, the breath of life goes into them. That's what God's
[3383.28 → 3396.42] word does. Takes dead skeletal structures and brings them new life. And so here, the servant reveals God
[3396.42 → 3404.86] by his word. He is the revealed word of God, right? You come to the servant, and you hear, and his word is
[3404.86 → 3411.96] transformational. It is life-giving. Now, you can probably see where I'm going with this, right?
[3412.02 → 3416.32] Because that probably sounds like someone, or at least part of your mind is tingling, or your heart
[3416.32 → 3421.56] is stirring, because as I read that, that sounds a lot like Jesus, right? Jesus who preached,
[3421.56 → 3433.04] come to me all who are weary, and I will give you rest. In fact, I think that this text here in Isaiah 50,
[3433.04 → 3440.22] and perhaps even all the other servant songs in Isaiah, are what John has when he writes his gospel,
[3440.58 → 3445.92] sort of in the back of his mind, right? I think it's that John has this language permeates throughout
[3445.92 → 3453.36] his writing. And so maybe you remember John 1. John 1 begins, in the beginning was the word, and the word
[3453.36 → 3461.16] was with God, and the word was God. And then in verse 14 of chapter 1, the word became flesh and made his
[3461.16 → 3467.92] dwelling among us. And then John 5 verse 24 says, very truly I tell you, this is Jesus speaking,
[3468.32 → 3474.22] whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged, but has
[3474.22 → 3484.92] crossed over from death to life. The word of Jesus transforms you from death to life. John 6, 63,
[3484.92 → 3493.32] the words I have spoken to you, they are full of spirit and life. Peter cries out in John 6, 68,
[3493.44 → 3502.62] Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. God sends his word to bring life to
[3502.62 → 3511.00] the world, a life of rest for the weary, an eternal life full of the spirit that comes by the word,
[3511.00 → 3520.52] right? That's the servant and his responsibility in the prophet Isaiah, and that is Jesus and his work
[3520.52 → 3530.48] in the history of redemption. And I think that we can use a goodly and a godly reminder of that
[3530.48 → 3540.24] right now. Jesus is still speaking to his church, and the way that he does that primarily, ordinarily,
[3540.24 → 3548.70] is through the word and through the sacrament. In traditional theology, we talk about the preached
[3548.70 → 3555.82] word and the sacrament as the ordinary means of grace. And that's not to say that they are
[3555.82 → 3561.68] anything less than supernatural, that is to say that this is the regular way that God communicates to us,
[3561.80 → 3569.34] and we need to be reminded of that, because some of us have let our faith grow cold. Some of us have
[3569.34 → 3583.96] found apathy more familiar than vitality. The word and the sacrament bring life, and so come and hear
[3583.96 → 3590.90] and see and taste and know this newness of life that God has for you.
[3590.90 → 3604.00] See, the servant is helping us to see what we can't do, but still try and do, and that's why we feel so
[3604.00 → 3611.52] tired or weary or beat down. We are blind to the truth, and then we live out of that blindness.
[3612.36 → 3619.74] We are captive to our own efforts at self-justification, and we are trapped in prisons of our own making,
[3619.74 → 3626.00] whether it's the stockade of religiosity as we strive to earn God's favour, or it's the chains of
[3626.00 → 3632.30] irreligion as we try to cast off any claim to the divine or any claim the divine has on us.
[3632.60 → 3640.84] We are bound in our sinfulness to a path that goes nowhere, but neither of these are the rest and the
[3640.84 → 3652.74] freedom that God has designed for us. In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus begins his ministry by preaching,
[3653.74 → 3660.56] and the words then speaks a word, and he says, and we already read it actually in our litany earlier,
[3661.10 → 3666.66] the spirit of the Lord is on me because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor.
[3666.66 → 3672.00] He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind,
[3672.12 → 3680.72] to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favour. The servant is your hope because
[3680.72 → 3687.80] he is something new, he is something different, he is something you can't do and yet try over and over
[3687.80 → 3697.40] and over again. That's the one thing about that phrase, the sovereign Lord, right, and Isaiah repeating
[3697.40 → 3705.40] it, is that the servant is your hope because he is one with the sovereign Lord, right? The servant of
[3705.40 → 3714.30] Isaiah 42 and 49, 50 and 53 is ultimately familiar with the sovereign Lord, that is maximally familiar
[3714.30 → 3725.42] with the sovereign Lord as a father and son. The servant is the agent of the sovereign, the son is the voice of the father.
[3729.42 → 3738.64] Verse 4 and 5 are giving us a glimpse or a window into the relationship between the servant
[3738.64 → 3744.44] and the sovereign, between the sovereign, between the father and the son. We read,
[3744.78 → 3750.62] he wakens me morning by morning, wakens my ear to listen like one being instructed.
[3752.32 → 3757.98] And if you are familiar with the story of Jesus, you know that already at 12 years old,
[3758.22 → 3764.70] everyone was amazed at his understanding, everyone was amazed at the kinds of questions he asked,
[3764.70 → 3768.94] even as he was found in the temple. And he said, when he was found in the temple,
[3769.18 → 3775.60] did you not know I had to be, had to be in my father's house? Right, Luke tells us in that same
[3775.60 → 3783.18] text that Jesus grew in wisdom and stature. Hebrews 5 verse 8 says that he learned obedience.
[3784.62 → 3792.86] Right, you see it here. What we get in the gospels and the story of Jesus is what Isaiah said we would get
[3792.86 → 3804.28] with the servant in verse 4 and 5. But it goes even further. The sovereign Lord has opened my ears.
[3804.46 → 3811.98] He has made me learn. He's learned obedience. And I've heard this teaching and I pass it on to you,
[3812.70 → 3820.62] says the servant. And get this, this is exactly what Jesus says in John 12. John 12, Jesus says,
[3820.62 → 3826.86] for I did not speak on my own, but the father who sent me commanded me to say all that I have spoken.
[3827.54 → 3835.04] I know that his commands lead to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the father has told me to say.
[3835.60 → 3842.50] The words of the servant are the very same words of the sovereign Lord because they are one and the same.
[3842.50 → 3852.44] And it goes deeper still. Right, in Hebrew, again, the language of Isaiah, to hear is to obey.
[3853.58 → 3861.20] Right, they're almost used interchangeably. And to say, I heard you, is to say, I obey you.
[3861.96 → 3869.76] To say, you didn't hear me, is to say, you disobeyed me. I have to tell you, I wish for my kids
[3869.76 → 3875.54] that hear meant obey as well. Because I don't know how many times I've told, hey, did you clean your
[3875.54 → 3881.42] room? I heard you, dad. I don't care if you heard me. Furthermore, I cared if you did it. But in Hebrew, they are the
[3881.42 → 3888.82] same. To hear is to obey. And so when the servant points out that, and the point of the servant hearing
[3888.82 → 3897.20] then is that the servant has obeyed. Hearing, being obeying, makes sense of that last line in verse 5.
[3897.20 → 3903.42] Right, where the servant says, I have not been rebellious. I have not turned away. Because throughout
[3903.42 → 3909.70] the entire Old Testament, people are instructed over and over again to be careful to do what the Lord
[3909.70 → 3916.90] your God has commanded you. Do not turn to the left or to the right. Right, Proverbs 4, 27 says, do not
[3916.90 → 3925.40] turn to the right or to the left. Keep your foot from evil. And yet, what we also know from Romans 3,
[3925.40 → 3930.76] for instance, is that there is no one righteous, not even one. There is no one who understands, no one
[3930.76 → 3937.44] who seeks God. All have turned away. They together have become worthless. There is no one who does good,
[3937.72 → 3944.84] not even one. Right, the surface narrative of the Old Testament is Israel failing to stay on that
[3944.84 → 3949.50] straight and narrow. Is Israel failing to not turn to the left or to the right, but to going left and to
[3949.50 → 3954.54] going right and to going further left and further right. Right, the men and the women of the Old Testament
[3954.54 → 3961.10] prove the point. And to be frank with you, right, my own life, my own struggle to obedience, to really
[3961.10 → 3969.28] hear the voice of God, proves the point. From the beginning, all history proves Romans 3, 23 true
[3969.28 → 3977.02] when it says, all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. What we need, we can't do, but the
[3977.02 → 3984.10] servant does. I have not been rebellious. I have not turned away. The servant is Jesus. Jesus hears,
[3984.10 → 3993.00] and obeys. In 1 John 2, Jesus is called the righteous one. And so, if the surface narrative of the
[3993.00 → 4000.50] Old Testament tells one story, our story of inability, the deeper narrative of the Old Testament tells
[4000.50 → 4008.90] God's gospel story. From the very beginning, the servant is being revealed. Right, God creates sons
[4008.90 → 4015.12] and daughters in Adam and Eve, and all sons and daughters fall into sin because of their rebellion.
[4015.24 → 4021.54] But God promises at that moment a true and better son who will crush the head of the serpent and who
[4021.54 → 4030.22] will restore us to the Father. For just as disobedience of one man brought the many, the many were made
[4030.22 → 4038.96] sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man, the many will be made righteous. This is the servant.
[4040.14 → 4048.30] Jesus hears and obeys. The life I should have lived, but daily prove that I can't. He lives in perfect
[4048.30 → 4055.68] obedience. The death that I deserve, He bears. Right, for just as through the disobedience of the one man, the many were made
[4055.68 → 4063.76] sinners. So also through the obedience of the one man, the many will be made righteous. This is the servant.
[4065.84 → 4074.44] And this is what He's done, what He has done. But how? How did He do it?
[4074.44 → 4085.94] I offered my back to those who beat me, my cheeks to those who pulled out my beard. I did not hide my face
[4085.94 → 4096.10] from mocking and spitting. Mark 10, Jesus tells His disciples, we are going to Jerusalem, and the Son of
[4096.10 → 4101.64] Man will be delivered. And Jesus says this, they will condemn Him to death and hand Him over. They will mock
[4101.64 → 4114.64] Him and spit on Him, flog Him, and kill Him. The suffering servant is the suffering Saviour, and He suffers
[4114.64 → 4123.48] for you. I hear that this morning, if you hear anything from me. Jesus suffered and died for you.
[4124.62 → 4130.90] It doesn't matter what your sins are, His death washes over them. Even when you don't really believe that to
[4130.90 → 4139.70] be true, it is true. Even when you feel unworthy or unloved, His love is greater, and His love is for you.
[4141.46 → 4149.34] Even if it seems like chaos and everything is out of control, remember the deeper narrative of God's
[4149.34 → 4159.70] gospel story. And here's the thing, I can't remember that on my own, right? I forget the love of God for me,
[4159.70 → 4169.84] right? And apart from hearing Him, I can't obey. And I'm sure that I'm not alone in that.
[4171.24 → 4181.04] We come here every week to hear the voice of Jesus. We come here every week, hopefully not because the
[4181.04 → 4186.48] kids' programs will give you a break, though I hope it does do that. Right? We come here every week not
[4186.48 → 4192.20] only because we are alone throughout the week, or we need a deep experience of community, though I pray
[4192.20 → 4197.78] that we are that for everyone. We come here not because you're looking for a boyfriend or a
[4197.78 → 4203.26] girlfriend and the church is a good place for that, maybe the best place for that. And if that's what
[4203.26 → 4208.78] God has in store for you, I hope you find that. We come here not because the speaker is moderately okay
[4208.78 → 4216.52] and the worship is great. We come here because here you hear Jesus.
[4218.60 → 4224.78] And when we forget that His grace is greater than all my sins, when we forget that we are lavishly
[4224.78 → 4231.46] loved children of the Father, when we forget that God is in control, not my fears, not my anxieties,
[4231.46 → 4239.78] we need to come here to the Word and to the table so we can be reminded. We come here for a Word from the
[4239.78 → 4249.16] Word that sustains the weary. When we are close to giving up, we have to come to the servant who never
[4249.16 → 4258.34] gives up. Because the sovereign Lord helps me, I will not be disgraced. Now hear this,
[4258.34 → 4267.82] therefore I have set my face like flint and I know I will not be put to shame.
[4269.48 → 4278.52] This is the hard face of Jesus. This is His devotion, His commitment, His unflinching,
[4278.80 → 4285.26] enduring for the path that was set before Him. Right? Even when He prayed, Father, if at all possible,
[4285.26 → 4293.20] remove this cup from me, He said, yet not my will be done but Yours. And He walked to that cross
[4293.20 → 4306.10] thinking of you and me and you. This is who we come to hear from. Right? Jesus endured. He didn't give up.
[4306.10 → 4314.34] Jesus endured. And He will not leave you behind. He will cause you to endure. He won't give up on you.
[4315.76 → 4323.16] And because Jesus won't give up on you, neither will I. Because Jesus won't give up on you, neither will we.
[4323.84 → 4333.30] But we will come together to come to Jesus. When our sins testify against us, when our life tells us
[4333.30 → 4341.32] a false story, when the promises of the world fail, our only comfort is to look to the suffering servant,
[4341.46 → 4347.72] who, though innocent, was stricken on our behalf. Even though He was just and pure, He bore the weight
[4347.72 → 4356.74] of our injustice. He took our condemnation to give you new life. That is why we are here.
[4356.74 → 4368.78] All I have is Christ. Hallelujah. All I have is Christ. I'm going to ask you to stand.
[4370.06 → 4376.76] For our prayer, I'm going to read a text over you. While we are reading this text team, worship team,
[4376.80 → 4380.82] I want you to come up here so that we can jump right into the song immediately following you.
[4380.82 → 4390.84] We will take that as our prayer. All I have is Christ. What then shall we say in response to
[4390.84 → 4399.14] these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him
[4399.14 → 4406.06] up for us all, how will He not also, along with Him, graciously give us all things? Who will bring
[4406.06 → 4413.32] any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. Who then is the one who condemns?
[4413.82 → 4419.72] No one. Christ Jesus, who died more than that, who was raised to life, is at the right hand of God and
[4419.72 → 4428.40] is also interceding for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or
[4428.40 → 4436.36] persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? As it is written, for your sake we face death
[4436.36 → 4443.46] all day long. We are considered as sheep to be slaughtered. But no, in all these things we are
[4443.46 → 4450.68] more than conquerors through Him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither
[4450.68 → 4455.42] angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth,
[4455.42 → 4461.58] nor anything else, in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus
[4461.58 → 4468.88] our Lord. All I have is Christ. Amen.
[4468.88 → 4468.98] Amen.
[4468.98 → 4470.98] Hallelujah.
[4474.98 → 4479.38] Hallelujah.
[4479.38 → 4501.34] All I have is Christ. Hallelujah. All I have is Christ. Hallelujah. Jesus is my Lord.
[4501.34 → 4520.24] I once was lost in the darkest night, yet thought I knew the way. The sin that promised joy and light
[4520.24 → 4531.32] had led me to the grave. I had no hope that you would have been to the grave. I had no hope that you would have been to the grave.
[4531.32 → 4539.52] Diego to Jesus built on us when you would have void in the grave. I was not a rebel to be LORD
[4539.52 → 4554.14] And if you had not loved me first, I would refuse you still own will soon have agreed to face
[4554.14 → 4558.56] But as I ran, I have a grace to live enough's life of mine. And if you would burn upon us at a stone, thank you should have fought well
[4558.56 → 4567.16] I have a grace indifferent to the cross.
[4567.16 → 4579.52] You looked upon my helpless state and led me to the cross.
[4579.98 → 4585.04] And I beheld God's love displayed.
[4585.04 → 4591.56] You suffered in my face.
[4591.56 → 4597.56] You bore the wrath of Christ upon me.
[4598.08 → 4606.42] Now all I know is grace.
[4606.42 → 4611.94] Hallelujah.
[4611.94 → 4618.74] All my hand is Christ.
[4618.74 → 4623.94] Hallelujah.
[4623.94 → 4630.96] Jesus is my life.
[4630.96 → 4635.90] Hallelujah.
[4635.90 → 4642.92] All I have is Christ.
[4642.92 → 4646.44] Hallelujah.
[4646.44 → 4648.44] Hallelujah.
[4648.44 → 4655.44] Jesus is my life.
[4655.44 → 4662.96] Now Lord, I would be yours someday.
[4662.96 → 4669.48] And live so long I see.
[4669.48 → 4681.48] The strength to follow your commands could never come from me.
[4681.48 → 4693.88] Oh, Father, you choose my handsome life in any way you choose.
[4693.88 → 4706.00] And let my soul forever be my only hope still to.
[4706.00 → 4708.00] Hallelujah.
[4708.00 → 4709.00] Hallelujah.
[4709.00 → 4711.00] Hallelujah.
[4711.00 → 4713.00] Hallelujah.
[4713.00 → 4715.00] Hallelujah.
[4715.00 → 4720.60] All I have is Christ.
[4720.60 → 4722.52] Hallelujah.
[4722.52 → 4724.52] Hallelujah.
[4724.52 → 4732.52] Jesus is my life.
[4732.52 → 4733.52] Hallelujah.
[4733.52 → 4734.52] Hallelujah.
[4734.52 → 4735.52] Hallelujah.
[4735.52 → 4736.52] Hallelujah.
[4736.52 → 4737.52] Hallelujah.
[4737.52 → 4738.52] Hallelujah.
[4738.52 → 4743.52] All I have is Christ.
[4743.52 → 4748.52] Hallelujah.
[4748.52 → 4753.52] Jesus is my life.
[4753.52 → 4754.52] Hallelujah.
[4754.52 → 4776.52] Jesus is my life.
[4776.52 → 4777.96] Hallelujah.
[4777.96 → 4778.62] Hallelujah.
[4778.62 → 4779.40] Hallelujah.
[4779.40 → 4783.88] Hallelujah.
[4783.88 → 4790.92] Have a seat. We come to the table of our Lord.
[4793.36 → 4799.32] Here we are reminded what the suffering servant has done.
[4800.04 → 4807.02] Here we are invited to remember, but not only as a passive act of the mind,
[4807.02 → 4818.66] but as an act of God to your heart that would sign and seal your faith and your experience of him.
[4819.62 → 4823.72] As we come to the table, we will invite you to participate with the liturgy,
[4824.44 → 4829.54] and then we will have the elders come forward, and they will serve you in your seats together.
[4830.90 → 4835.52] At his last supper, our Lord Jesus took bread,
[4835.52 → 4840.94] and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[4841.34 → 4844.82] This is my body, which is for you.
[4845.80 → 4848.64] Do this in remembrance of me.
[4850.16 → 4854.30] In the same way, he took the cup after supper,
[4854.90 → 4859.54] and he said, This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[4860.40 → 4863.68] Do this in remembrance of me.
[4863.68 → 4867.54] For whenever we eat this bread and drink this cup,
[4867.66 → 4872.82] we proclaim the Lord's death and resurrection until he comes again.
[4873.76 → 4881.06] Therefore, we proclaim our faith as signed and sealed in this sacrament.
[4881.06 → 4895.26] Church family, the Lord has prepared his table for all who love him,
[4895.56 → 4898.70] for all who trust in him alone for their salvation.
[4899.42 → 4901.42] If you are truly sorry for your sins,
[4901.48 → 4904.76] if you sincerely believe in the Lord Jesus as your Saviour,
[4904.88 → 4907.38] and you desire to live in obedience to him,
[4907.38 → 4910.56] whether you are here in this sanctuary together,
[4910.68 → 4914.30] or participating at home, part of our community online,
[4914.36 → 4919.30] you are invited to come with gladness to the table of our Lord.
[4920.12 → 4923.96] The gifts of God for the people of God.
[4924.70 → 4926.08] I'd like to invite the elders forward.
[4926.08 → 4939.20] Joseph document a rope ack and hand in thanks.
[4939.20 → 4941.20] Amen.
[4969.20 → 4984.74] Holy, Lord, God Almighty, early in the morning, our song shall rise to thee.
[4984.74 → 5005.26] Holy, Holy, Holy, merciful and mighty, our victory, present blessed Trinity.
[5005.26 → 5028.26] Holy, Holy, Holy, all the saints are holy, passing down their golden cross upon the blessed sea.
[5028.26 → 5040.24] Share them and send them, falling down before thee.
[5040.90 → 5051.12] Who are them all, and their turn more shall be.
[5051.12 → 5074.12] Holy, Holy, Holy, though the darkness hide thee, though thee are made blind by sin, thy glory may not see.
[5074.12 → 5087.12] Only thou art holy, there is none beside thee.
[5088.26 → 5097.76] Perfect in power in love and purity.
[5097.76 → 5099.76] Perfect in power in love and purity.
[5099.76 → 5100.76] Perfect in power in peace.
[5100.76 → 5112.76] Perfect in power in glory, O Lord, God Almighty, Lord, God Almighty.
[5112.76 → 5118.76] Perfect in power in glory, O Lord, God, every joy shall rise to thee.
[5118.76 → 5132.98] His flag is shining
[5132.98 → 5140.32] in your hand parent as I see
[5140.32 → 5142.12] Holy, holy, holy
[5142.12 → 5153.36] Lord, healing, our Son, blessed Trinity.
[5164.04 → 5169.28] Of the suffering servant, this is the body of Christ broken for you.
[5169.28 → 5178.18] And so take, eat, remember, and believe that the body of Christ was given for the complete forgiveness of all our sins.
[5199.28 → 5201.28] Amen.
[5201.28 → 5202.28] Amen.
[5202.28 → 5203.28] Amen.
[5203.28 → 5204.28] Amen.
[5204.28 → 5207.28] Amen.
[5207.28 → 5209.28] Amen.
[5209.28 → 5229.70] Here is love vast as the ocean
[5229.70 → 5235.16] Loving kindness as the cloud
[5235.16 → 5239.56] When the Prince of life our ransom
[5239.56 → 5245.50] Shed for us His precious blood
[5245.50 → 5253.06] Here is love vast as the ocean
[5253.06 → 5258.20] Loving kindness as the cloud
[5258.20 → 5262.80] When the Prince of life our ransom
[5262.80 → 5268.62] Shed for us His precious blood
[5268.62 → 5273.20] Who His love will not remember
[5273.20 → 5279.28] Who can cease to sing His praise
[5279.28 → 5283.78] He can never be forgotten
[5283.78 → 5289.50] Throughout death's eternal day
[5289.50 → 5297.60] On the mount of grace and fiction
[5297.60 → 5303.44] Fountains open deep and wide
[5303.44 → 5308.32] Through the floodgates of God's mercy
[5308.32 → 5314.26] Float a vast and gracious tide
[5314.26 → 5320.08] Grace and love thy mighty river
[5320.08 → 5324.66] Born incessant from above
[5324.66 → 5330.56] Heaven's peace and perfect justice
[5330.56 → 5336.38] Kiss the guilty world in love
[5336.38 → 5340.96] Who His love will not remember
[5340.96 → 5346.86] Who can cease to sing His praise
[5346.86 → 5351.66] He can never be forgotten
[5351.66 → 5357.48] Throughout death's eternal day
[5357.48 → 5362.66] Who His love will not remember
[5362.66 → 5368.48] Who can cease to sing His praise
[5368.48 → 5374.30] He can never be forgotten
[5374.30 → 5380.48] Throughout death's eternal day
[5380.48 → 5382.08] Love of Christ's ship
[5382.08 → 5402.48] Brothers and sisters
[5402.48 → 5406.02] Children of our sovereign Lord
[5406.02 → 5407.68] Lord lavishly loved
[5407.68 → 5408.82] Love of the Father in heaven
[5408.82 → 5411.10] This is the blood of Christ
[5411.10 → 5412.74] Shed for you
[5412.74 → 5416.82] Take, drink, remember and believe
[5416.82 → 5417.76] That the precious blood
[5417.76 → 5418.88] Of our Lord Jesus Christ
[5418.88 → 5420.78] Was shed for the complete forgiveness
[5420.78 → 5423.20] Of all our sins
[5423.20 → 5434.28] Amen
[5434.28 → 5437.56] As you're able
[5437.56 → 5438.82] I'm going to invite you to stand
[5438.82 → 5441.08] And I will conclude our experience
[5441.08 → 5442.40] Here at the table with a prayer
[5442.40 → 5445.58] And then we will finish
[5445.58 → 5449.62] With our parting blessing
[5449.62 → 5455.66] Loving God
[5455.66 → 5458.92] We thank you that you have fed us
[5458.92 → 5460.82] In this sacrament
[5460.82 → 5463.46] That at this table
[5463.46 → 5466.26] You have united us with Christ
[5466.26 → 5469.22] You have united us with one another
[5469.22 → 5472.28] And that here we have a foretaste
[5472.28 → 5473.40] Of the heavenly banquet
[5473.40 → 5475.72] In your eternal kingdom to come
[5475.72 → 5478.70] Send us out now
[5478.70 → 5480.42] In the power of your spirit
[5480.42 → 5482.08] To live and to work
[5482.08 → 5485.26] To your praise and glory
[5485.26 → 5488.74] For Jesus' sake we pray
[5488.74 → 5490.22] Amen
[5490.22 → 5496.40] Family of God
[5496.40 → 5499.70] From our table to your tables
[5499.70 → 5502.76] Go with the blessing of God
[5502.76 → 5505.52] May God go before you
[5505.52 → 5506.68] To guide you
[5506.68 → 5508.58] May God go behind you
[5508.58 → 5509.62] To protect you
[5509.62 → 5511.34] May God go beneath you
[5511.34 → 5512.24] To support you
[5512.24 → 5514.00] And may God go beside you
[5514.00 → 5515.06] To befriend you
[5515.06 → 5517.02] Do not be afraid
[5517.02 → 5518.88] Let the blessing of God
[5518.88 → 5519.86] Come upon you today
[5519.86 → 5521.80] Do not be afraid
[5521.80 → 5524.44] But go in peace
[5524.44 → 5527.42] To love and serve the Lord
[5527.42 → 5528.94] Everyone said
[5528.94 → 5530.32] Amen
[5530.32 → 5553.98] Then of faith rise up and sing
[5553.98 → 5558.46] Of the great and glorious King
[5558.46 → 5562.80] You are strong when you feel weak
[5562.80 → 5567.30] In your brokenness complete
[5567.30 → 5568.24] Give me
[5568.24 → 5572.20] If we shout to you
[5572.20 → 5594.54] No part of TUA
