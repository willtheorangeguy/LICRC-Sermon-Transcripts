[0.00 → 18.36] Good morning.
[20.50 → 23.32] Welcome to church.
[23.96 → 28.32] So, this morning, you probably noticed, if you're here on the way in,
[28.32 → 31.42] or if you're participating online, that things looked a little different.
[32.00 → 38.74] And that's because our pro-presenter system has decided it's not going to work today.
[39.24 → 41.02] And so that means we have no overhead projection.
[41.46 → 46.46] If you're on the live stream, that means you have no cards or titles or lyrics or anything.
[46.90 → 49.68] So our humblest apologies for that.
[50.52 → 54.10] If you are a member here, however, you did receive an e-bulletin,
[54.10 → 56.58] and in the e-bulletin is an order of worship.
[56.58 → 58.80] So you can see the songs that are coming,
[58.92 → 62.28] and then you can use your phone or your device or whatever to find the lyrics that way.
[62.62 → 65.56] That'll be the best way to sing along with us here.
[66.50 → 69.82] For those of us here, you have it all on paper, believe it or not.
[70.26 → 71.06] I know, right?
[72.20 → 74.96] There are also a couple handouts that go with Pastor Kevin's sermon
[74.96 → 79.08] that will help in that point as well.
[79.26 → 82.96] So, let me say, welcome to church.
[82.96 → 86.56] I know for some of you, this is the first time back since we've regathered,
[86.56 → 88.94] because we've only been doing this for two weeks in this capacity.
[89.24 → 91.62] And so we're so glad to have you here.
[92.40 → 94.84] My name is Chris, and I am one of the pastors here.
[94.94 → 98.98] And it's my privilege, along with these others, to lead us in worship
[98.98 → 103.30] and later in our service to lead us in the table.
[103.64 → 107.18] And so if you are at home, I invite you to have some elements ready,
[107.36 → 111.08] some bread and juice that you can participate in that with us.
[111.08 → 113.80] Before we begin, I just want to make one more announcement.
[114.06 → 116.30] And a number of you have heard this one already,
[116.42 → 119.42] but we are busy looking for volunteers.
[120.02 → 124.32] Volunteers both for the summer and for work being done into the future.
[125.14 → 128.20] And so we still need a couple of people to sign up for nursery
[128.20 → 129.58] through the summer months.
[129.76 → 132.80] And so you can, at the back table there, there will be someone,
[132.90 → 136.12] or you can contact Brenda Alchemy to help round out that list.
[136.12 → 141.58] As well, we are looking for a GEMS co-coordinator.
[141.96 → 144.72] And so this is someone who will work in our GEMS group,
[144.82 → 146.64] which is a young girls' ministry.
[147.50 → 149.28] And they will work with Courtney, who's at the back.
[149.36 → 149.90] Courtney Wave.
[150.62 → 151.46] Everyone, that's Courtney.
[152.18 → 153.88] Courtney is the current coordinator.
[154.00 → 156.14] She's looking for someone to partner with her in that.
[156.26 → 159.66] So she's fine with doing the weekly meetings and stuff,
[159.74 → 161.70] but she's looking for someone who can help behind the scenes.
[161.70 → 164.22] And so if you're more of a behind-the-scenes administrator,
[165.06 → 167.50] connect with Courtney and bless her in that way.
[168.38 → 171.42] As well, we're looking for children's worship time coordinators.
[171.68 → 175.00] And so if you have some ideas or hopes or desires,
[175.16 → 176.60] or you feel God leading you in that,
[177.04 → 181.32] talk to myself or Pastor Kevin or Nikki following the service,
[181.40 → 183.34] and we can get that all together.
[184.74 → 186.38] Also, for those of us who are here,
[186.68 → 189.06] we have confirmed the coffee is brewing.
[189.06 → 193.96] So apologies for last week's feeble attempt.
[194.22 → 196.90] So far this week, it seems to be working.
[197.32 → 201.50] So please stick around for fellowship after our worship together.
[201.60 → 204.44] And you can do that in this space or in the air-conditioned foyer
[204.44 → 207.82] or out in the courtyard or outside here in the park.
[208.54 → 211.22] But just stick around, share life and story together.
[212.06 → 214.38] We gather to worship our God because he is good,
[214.46 → 216.24] and he calls us to worship him.
[216.30 → 218.10] And so as you're able, I'm going to invite you to stand.
[218.10 → 222.20] We can receive God's greeting as we are ushered into his presence.
[224.54 → 226.84] Receive the greeting of our good God.
[228.56 → 232.04] Grace, mercy, and peace to you.
[232.60 → 236.46] From God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Saviour,
[236.86 → 239.46] through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[240.46 → 240.80] Amen.
[241.48 → 242.58] Let's worship God together.
[242.58 → 246.76] Good morning and welcome to worship.
[247.42 → 251.36] Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 105, verses 1 to 3.
[252.14 → 253.14] Give thanks to the Lord.
[253.44 → 254.24] Call on his name.
[254.58 → 256.76] Make known among the nations what he has done.
[257.40 → 258.02] Sing to him.
[258.28 → 259.44] Sing praise to him.
[259.88 → 261.60] Tell of all his wondrous acts.
[262.24 → 263.66] Glory in his holy name.
[264.10 → 266.46] Let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice.
[266.46 → 292.02] Lord, I lift your name on high.
[292.02 → 295.50] Lord, I love to sing your praises.
[297.58 → 302.38] I'm so glad you're in my life.
[302.64 → 307.32] I'm so glad you came to save us.
[307.68 → 313.00] You came from heaven to earth to show the way.
[313.00 → 318.12] From the earth to the cross, my debt to pay.
[318.12 → 320.70] From the cross to the grave.
[320.92 → 323.36] From the grave to the sky.
[323.62 → 326.56] Lord, I lift your name on high.
[328.56 → 332.00] Lord, I lift your name on high.
[332.00 → 361.06] Lord, I lift your name on high.
[361.06 → 369.78] From the cross to the grave, from the grave to the sky, Lord, I lift your name on high.
[369.78 → 381.00] You came from heaven to earth to show the way, from the earth to the cross, my death to play.
[381.00 → 390.60] From the cross to the grave, from the grave to the sky, Lord, I lift your name on high.
[391.06 → 396.06] Lord, I lift your name on high.
[400.06 → 401.86] Join me in our prayer of confession.
[408.26 → 411.68] Lord, we come before you.
[412.48 → 418.64] We lift our voices in praise to you as we gather in worship in awe of your splendour and majesty.
[418.64 → 420.96] Who can compare?
[422.24 → 425.28] But even in our praises, we fall short.
[426.28 → 428.06] Every day we fall short.
[429.16 → 432.34] We are sinful and forgetful people, oh God.
[432.56 → 434.18] Have mercy on us.
[435.22 → 441.02] Have mercy on us when we willingly reject you and turn to earthly idols for satisfaction.
[441.02 → 449.14] Have mercy on us when we harbour anger and spite against those who have pained us or disagree with us.
[449.74 → 456.70] Have mercy on us when we forget your promises and are consumed with the worries of this world.
[457.62 → 459.44] Have mercy, oh Lord.
[460.26 → 462.28] Have mercy on us.
[462.28 → 483.28] Lord have mercy on me.
[483.28 → 504.28] Lord have mercy on me.
[504.28 → 516.28] I've forgotten the words that you have spoken.
[516.28 → 525.18] Promises that burned within my heart have now grown dim.
[525.18 → 535.32] With a doubting heart I follow the paths of earthly wisdom.
[536.44 → 540.36] Forgive me for my unbelief.
[540.36 → 545.36] Renew the fire again.
[545.36 → 546.36] Renew the fire again.
[546.36 → 552.36] Lord have mercy.
[552.36 → 557.14] Christ have mercy.
[557.14 → 566.36] Lord have mercy on me.
[566.36 → 585.36] Lord have mercy on me.
[585.36 → 586.16] I have mercy on you.
[587.94 → 589.62] I have mercy on me.
[589.62 → 589.82] I have mercy on me.
[589.82 → 590.36] I have mercy on me.
[590.36 → 591.34] I have mercy on me.
[591.36 → 592.96] I have mercy on me.
[592.96 → 597.06] Where I worship things of man.
[598.58 → 606.64] I have taken journeys that have drawn me far from you.
[606.64 → 616.34] Now I am returning to your mercies ever flowing
[616.34 → 626.08] Pardon my transgressions, help me love you again
[626.08 → 637.38] Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy
[637.38 → 646.82] Lord have mercy on me
[646.82 → 656.52] Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy
[656.52 → 666.30] Lord have mercy on me
[666.30 → 673.18] I have longed to know you
[673.18 → 678.58] And all your tender mercies
[678.58 → 682.10] Like a river of forgiveness
[682.10 → 687.18] Ever flowing without end
[687.70 → 692.36] So I bow my heart before you
[692.36 → 698.32] In the goodness of your presence
[698.32 → 701.54] Your grace forever shining
[701.54 → 709.72] Like a beacon in the night
[709.72 → 719.34] Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy
[719.34 → 728.34] Lord have mercy on me
[728.34 → 738.34] Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy
[738.34 → 747.34] Lord have mercy on me
[747.34 → 754.20] You hear our cries for mercy, O Lord
[754.20 → 756.48] You listen to us again and again
[756.48 → 758.48] Every time we fall short
[758.48 → 761.52] And you give us life when we deserve death
[761.52 → 763.68] A gift of life in you
[763.68 → 765.42] Christ Jesus, our Lord
[765.42 → 768.62] What grace, what amazing grace
[768.62 → 770.76] The sweet assurance you offer
[770.76 → 772.12] As we come to know you
[772.12 → 773.56] In your name
[773.56 → 775.16] In your life
[775.16 → 776.66] In your death
[776.66 → 777.80] And your resurrection
[777.80 → 779.02] Amen
[779.02 → 796.70] How, in your happiness
[798.14 → 800.02] So for free
[800.02 → 824.62] What gift of grace is Jesus my Redeemer?
[824.62 → 831.56] There is no more for heaven now to give.
[832.22 → 837.66] He is my joy, my righteousness and freedom,
[838.66 → 844.80] my steadfast love, my deep and boundless peace.
[845.56 → 851.24] To this I hope, my hope is only Jesus.
[851.24 → 858.78] For my life is only bound to His.
[859.46 → 864.78] Oh, how strange and divine I can sing.
[864.88 → 871.96] All is mine, yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[871.96 → 889.02] The night is dark, but I am not forsaken.
[889.88 → 894.96] For by my side the Saviour, He will stay.
[894.96 → 902.82] I labour on in weakness and rejoicing.
[903.18 → 908.82] For in my heed His power is displayed.
[910.14 → 916.68] For this I hope my shepherd will defend me.
[916.68 → 923.16] Through the deepest valley He will lead.
[924.04 → 930.18] Oh, the night has been won, and I shall overcome.
[931.02 → 936.68] Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[936.68 → 953.54] No fate I dread, I know I am forgiven.
[953.54 → 961.32] The future sure, the price it has been paid.
[961.32 → 967.90] For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon.
[968.96 → 975.60] And He was raised to overthrow the grave.
[975.60 → 981.80] To this I hope my sin has been defeated.
[982.96 → 988.44] Jesus now and ever is my plea.
[989.94 → 993.10] Oh, the chains are released.
[993.38 → 996.48] I can sing, I am free.
[996.48 → 1002.38] Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[1002.38 → 1018.86] With every breath I long to follow Jesus.
[1019.86 → 1026.38] For He has said that He will bring me home.
[1026.38 → 1033.52] And day by day I know He will renew me.
[1033.52 → 1040.08] Until I stand with joy before the throne.
[1041.08 → 1046.86] To this I hope, my hope is only Jesus.
[1048.32 → 1054.14] All the glory evermore to Him.
[1054.14 → 1058.10] When the race is complete.
[1058.10 → 1061.28] Till my lips shall repeat.
[1061.28 → 1067.28] Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[1067.28 → 1074.18] To this I hope, my hope is only Jesus.
[1074.18 → 1081.96] All the glory evermore to Him.
[1081.96 → 1086.04] When the race is complete.
[1086.04 → 1089.98] Till my lips shall repeat.
[1090.48 → 1096.60] Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[1096.60 → 1103.78] Till my lips shall repeat.
[1103.78 → 1104.94] Till my lips shall repeat.
[1104.94 → 1106.26] Till my lips shall repeat.
[1106.26 → 1106.54] Till my lips shall repeat.
[1106.54 → 1108.32] Kids, why don't you come on forward,
[1108.40 → 1111.86] come sit down in the floor here in front of me here for a moment.
[1112.78 → 1115.48] We're going to do the kids' blessing here in just a second.
[1119.20 → 1121.24] All right, come on down, come on down.
[1121.24 → 1121.28] Come on down.
[1121.28 → 1121.40] Come on down.
[1121.40 → 1123.20] Come on down.
[1123.20 → 1125.34] Come on down.
[1125.34 → 1129.28] All right, here comes a few more.
[1133.44 → 1134.82] How are you guys doing today?
[1135.72 → 1136.68] Yeah, we're doing good?
[1136.80 → 1137.50] How's summer going?
[1138.52 → 1138.84] Yeah?
[1139.32 → 1139.68] Good.
[1140.20 → 1140.78] Good, good.
[1140.88 → 1144.64] I'm going to lead us in a prayer, and then we're going to do the kids' blessing.
[1144.70 → 1147.46] And I'm going to remind you how we do the kids' blessing, okay, before we do that.
[1147.48 → 1151.82] But first, let's pray, and then we'll do the kids' blessing, and then we can go off to children's worship time, okay?
[1152.02 → 1153.54] So, please pray with me.
[1154.46 → 1156.06] Dear God, thank you so much for this day.
[1156.22 → 1161.34] Thank you that we can come to church with our friends, with our brothers and sisters, our family, Lord.
[1161.38 → 1163.94] And we just are so grateful that we can gather together once again.
[1164.12 → 1170.28] Thank you for being here, for these kids, for the kids' ministry, children's worship time.
[1170.32 → 1172.14] We pray that you'll be with them as they head off to that.
[1172.38 → 1175.50] Help us learn more about you and what it means to be a part of this world.
[1175.56 → 1179.28] And for all of us non-kids who stay back, may we do the same as well.
[1179.28 → 1180.38] We pray this in your name.
[1180.86 → 1181.12] Amen.
[1182.32 → 1182.68] Amen.
[1182.68 → 1182.80] Amen.
[1182.92 → 1184.84] Okay, so we're going to do the kids' blessing.
[1184.94 → 1185.52] So I'm going to remind you.
[1185.56 → 1186.34] So let's stand up.
[1187.16 → 1188.12] So stand up with me.
[1188.90 → 1194.44] So in a second, we're going to turn around to the church, and we're going to have our hands up, and we're going to say this.
[1194.52 → 1196.48] We're going to say, the Lord be with you.
[1196.62 → 1197.74] Can you say that with me right now?
[1197.82 → 1198.30] Let's practice.
[1198.72 → 1200.64] The Lord be with you.
[1201.10 → 1203.00] And then the church is going to say that back to us, okay?
[1203.32 → 1203.82] Are we ready?
[1204.16 → 1204.90] Okay, church, up you get.
[1205.36 → 1206.40] All right, let's turn around.
[1207.14 → 1207.82] Let's turn around.
[1207.88 → 1208.70] Look at all these people.
[1208.78 → 1209.60] Put your hands up.
[1209.60 → 1211.30] And let's say what we practiced, okay?
[1211.38 → 1212.50] We're going to say, the Lord be with you.
[1212.52 → 1212.92] Are you ready?
[1213.60 → 1214.12] Here we go.
[1214.82 → 1217.10] The Lord be with you.
[1217.84 → 1219.30] And also with you.
[1219.42 → 1219.82] All right.
[1219.86 → 1223.06] If you are in kindergarten or younger, you can head to children's worship time.
[1223.26 → 1224.92] And if you're older than that, you can head to your parents.
[1225.32 → 1227.54] If you need to know where that is.
[1228.26 → 1228.54] Yes.
[1229.12 → 1229.34] Yeah.
[1229.34 → 1229.40] Yeah.
[1231.00 → 1231.40] Right.
[1231.40 → 1231.42] Right.
[1231.42 → 1231.46] Right.
[1231.46 → 1231.50] Right.
[1231.50 → 1231.54] Right.
[1231.54 → 1231.58] Right.
[1231.58 → 1231.66] Right.
[1231.66 → 1233.50] Right.
[1233.50 → 1233.54] Right.
[1233.54 → 1235.56] Right.
[1235.56 → 1239.58] Right.
[1239.60 → 1239.70] Right.
[1252.08 → 1252.72] Right.
[1252.82 → 1253.52] Right.
[1253.52 → 1254.84] So good morning.
[1254.84 → 1258.38] We continue our worship by giving of our tithes and offerings.
[1258.38 → 1263.82] And our offerings today are for the budget and the ministries of this church.
[1264.88 → 1268.34] And our second offering, the special offering, is for Life Recovery.
[1269.36 → 1272.42] Life Recovery stands for Living in Freedom Every Day,
[1272.86 → 1278.40] and it is an agency that walks alongside women who are working to overcome addiction.
[1279.00 → 1284.82] It's located in Abbotsford, and Life Recovery has three residential homes.
[1284.82 → 1289.60] Women stay there for as short as three months and then for as long as they need to.
[1290.86 → 1293.12] Life Recovery is a Christian-registered charity,
[1293.44 → 1299.72] and they are committed to a program that focuses on physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional well-being.
[1301.76 → 1308.24] Next week, our offering will be for NAME, which stands for North American Indigenous Ministry,
[1308.76 → 1311.60] and it will be in support of Tim and Charity Johnson
[1311.60 → 1314.20] and the work that they do with the Shushan Band.
[1315.40 → 1319.66] In light of the unmarked burial sites of Kamloops Indian residential students,
[1319.78 → 1325.28] it is appropriate to give to this ministry as Tim and Charity seek to bring reconciliation through the gospel.
[1326.68 → 1330.22] And just as an aside, there is an increasing number of NAME staff members
[1330.22 → 1332.58] who are First Nations Native believers.
[1332.58 → 1337.80] Hear the word of the Lord regarding offering.
[1338.54 → 1343.54] Honour the Lord with your wealth, with the first fruits of all your crops.
[1344.54 → 1345.82] And that's from Proverbs 3.
[1345.82 → 1350.54] And also from Acts 20, Jesus himself said,
[1350.78 → 1354.30] It is more blessed to give than receive.
[1354.30 → 1359.32] And then just as a final note, because we haven't been meeting for a while,
[1359.52 → 1361.28] only one bag is passed around,
[1362.28 → 1366.40] and monies to the budget need to be marked in an envelope,
[1366.76 → 1368.46] so that will then go to the budget.
[1368.46 → 1371.02] And then any loose change or vouchers,
[1371.54 → 1374.86] or even if you wrote a check and made it out to a manual
[1374.86 → 1378.66] and then put it as a side memo to life recovery,
[1378.88 → 1383.12] then all those monies will be going to our special offering for life recovery.
[1383.12 → 1386.22] Okay, so do give generously.
[1386.22 → 1386.42] Okay.
[1413.12 → 1443.10] Thank you.
[1443.12 → 1473.10] Thank you.
[1473.12 → 1475.12] Thank you.
[1475.12 → 1476.12] Thank you.
[1476.12 → 1477.12] Thank you.
[1503.12 → 1505.12] Thank you.
[1505.12 → 1506.12] Thank you.
[1506.12 → 1507.12] Thank you.
[1507.12 → 1508.12] Thank you.
[1508.12 → 1509.12] Thank you.
[1527.12 → 1528.24] Well, good morning.
[1528.90 → 1532.54] I have one announcement before we go to our congregational prayer this morning.
[1532.54 → 1537.54] Last night, Mike Miles, the son of Willie and Joanne Miles,
[1537.54 → 1540.38] passed away suddenly and unexpectedly.
[1541.38 → 1544.10] We don't know all the details surrounding his passing,
[1544.54 → 1549.28] but the church office will let you know as more details become available.
[1549.28 → 1561.68] So we want to remember Willie and the entire Miles family in the weeks to come as they breathe loss of Mike.
[1561.68 → 1566.68] Let's go to our God in prayer.
[1566.68 → 1567.52] Let's go to our God in prayer.
[1572.68 → 1576.92] Almighty God, we thank you for calling us to worship on this beautiful morning.
[1576.92 → 1591.92] Father, we thank you for calling us to worship on this beautiful day, and we thank you for the grace and the mercy poured out through the body and blood of Christ.
[1591.92 → 1604.92] Thank you for the opportunity to remember Christ's death and resurrection through communion this morning.
[1604.92 → 1608.92] Father, we come to you with the concerns of our congregation this morning.
[1608.92 → 1616.92] We lift the family of Mike Miles after he passed away suddenly and unexpectedly yesterday.
[1616.92 → 1626.92] We ask that you be with Willie and Joanne, their entire family, and that they will experience your comforting presence as they mourn.
[1627.92 → 1631.92] Bless them and walk beside them in the weeks and the months ahead.
[1631.92 → 1644.92] Father, we ask that you be with Bob Kiss, and we pray that the treatments that he is receiving may lead to healing.
[1645.92 → 1652.92] Father, we also want to ask that you be with those who are shut in and isolated and may be experiencing loneliness or depression as a result.
[1652.92 → 1661.92] If that we may minister to them in whatever way possible, Lord, and we ask that you be a presence for them.
[1663.92 → 1673.92] Father, we ask that you deal with all those who are dealing with chronic pain, loss of memory, to be near to them, hold them, sustain them.
[1674.92 → 1680.92] Father, as we continue to experience the warm weather, we ask that you watch over those who have difficulty with it.
[1680.92 → 1686.92] And if there are ways that we can reach out and help, please make those available, Lord.
[1687.92 → 1691.92] Father, we continue to pray for the people of Lytton.
[1692.92 → 1698.92] And we ask your blessing on them as they mourn the loss of community and their homes.
[1699.92 → 1707.92] And bless them as they go through a process of rebuilding and as they are away from community for probably quite some time to come.
[1707.92 → 1710.92] Father, we ask for your blessing on the church around the world.
[1710.92 → 1722.92] If that it may be faithful in its call to proclaim the gospel and make disciples of all nations.
[1723.92 → 1729.92] Grant that we as individuals may also be faithful and obedient to that call to proclaim the gospel.
[1729.92 → 1734.92] Father, we ask for your blessing on the ministries of this church.
[1734.92 → 1738.92] We look forward to many of them starting up in the next few months.
[1739.92 → 1744.92] And Lord, we know that there are some leaders and volunteers still needed for some of these ministries.
[1744.92 → 1750.92] We pray that you would raise up people who have a heart for these ministries, Lord, and are willing to serve there.
[1751.92 → 1759.92] And we ask that each one of these ministries may bring all of its participants into a closer and deeper relationship with you.
[1759.92 → 1769.92] Father, we ask that you be with all those in all three levels of government and in Canada.
[1769.92 → 1778.92] And we pray that they may serve well, that they may govern responsibly, and that they may know that their authority has been given by you.
[1778.92 → 1792.92] Father, we ask that you bless Pastor Kevin with a rich measure of your spirit as he brings us your word.
[1792.92 → 1796.92] And give us hearts which are eager to receive that word.
[1797.92 → 1799.92] We ask this in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1808.92 → 1810.92] Amen.
[1820.92 → 1822.92] Good morning, everyone.
[1823.92 → 1825.92] I'm going to just start with this right away.
[1825.92 → 1826.92] There's no screen.
[1826.92 → 1827.92] We've been told that.
[1827.92 → 1830.92] So if you need a Bible, they're in the back.
[1830.92 → 1835.92] So this is a perfect time to get up, quickly go get a Bible in the back.
[1835.92 → 1837.92] We're going to be looking at some of those verses.
[1837.92 → 1839.92] If not, you've all got phones in your pocket.
[1839.92 → 1840.92] Let's take advantage of that.
[1840.92 → 1844.92] We'll be using whatever we can be today to look into the word.
[1844.92 → 1850.92] One of the last times I preached, I mentioned that I went golfing with Pastor Chris.
[1850.92 → 1852.92] And that I defeated him quite soundly.
[1852.92 → 1854.92] Now, perhaps you remember that.
[1854.92 → 1856.92] I'm sure I did, for sure.
[1856.92 → 1857.92] I remember that.
[1857.92 → 1858.92] Perhaps you don't, though.
[1858.92 → 1859.92] Because I was being pretty subtle.
[1859.92 → 1862.92] I didn't really make it that big of a deal.
[1862.92 → 1866.92] Well, Pastor Chris and I decided to go golfing again this week.
[1866.92 → 1869.92] And for a second 18 holes, we finished a nice game.
[1869.92 → 1874.92] Now, when it was all said and done, he really, really wanted me to make mention how
[1874.92 → 1877.92] last week's golf game went in my message this morning.
[1877.92 → 1879.92] But we just don't have the time.
[1879.92 → 1880.92] So we're just going to skip over.
[1880.92 → 1881.92] Sorry, Chris.
[1881.92 → 1883.92] If I had more time, we would talk about that.
[1883.92 → 1884.92] But I don't.
[1884.92 → 1885.92] The clock is ticking today.
[1885.92 → 1890.92] Speaking of today, I was reminded this morning that it's July the 11th, 7-11.
[1890.92 → 1892.92] So it's free Slurped Day.
[1892.92 → 1894.92] So you can grab one of those afterwards.
[1894.92 → 1896.92] Had a little bit of time to sneak that one in anyway.
[1896.92 → 1900.92] So if you're looking at something to do with the kids, grab your free Slurped.
[1900.92 → 1901.92] And it'll be good.
[1901.92 → 1902.92] Slur pees for the win.
[1902.92 → 1904.92] Anyway, enough rambling.
[1904.92 → 1905.92] You've gotten your Bibles.
[1905.92 → 1907.92] I killed enough time for that to happen.
[1907.92 → 1910.92] To the question at hand this morning.
[1910.92 → 1915.92] Now we're continuing our sermon series called Ask Anything.
[1915.92 → 1921.92] In which we've given you the opportunity to send in your questions, which we will then
[1921.92 → 1924.92] discuss and talk about on Sunday mornings here.
[1924.92 → 1927.92] Today we're going to be looking at this question.
[1927.92 → 1933.92] Does the name we call God matter for our salvation?
[1933.92 → 1936.92] Now the original question was a little longer than that.
[1936.92 → 1939.92] And so I'm going to paraphrase it for you a little bit right now.
[1939.92 → 1941.92] Now the whole question was this.
[1941.92 → 1947.92] Can calling on the name of Allah be the same as calling on the name of God?
[1947.92 → 1948.92] What is in a name?
[1948.92 → 1951.92] What is in the translation of a name?
[1951.92 → 1955.92] Muslims, for example, use the language of the Quran and it is Arabic.
[1955.92 → 1957.92] The Bible is translatable.
[1957.92 → 1959.92] It's written in many different languages.
[1959.92 → 1961.92] So what's in a name?
[1961.92 → 1965.92] Does the name we call God matter for our salvation?
[1965.92 → 1967.92] So that's the question today.
[1967.92 → 1968.92] It's a great question.
[1968.92 → 1971.92] And it's one that we're going to dig into a little bit.
[1971.92 → 1975.92] Now, before we get to our text today, there is a little bit of nuance to this question
[1975.92 → 1976.92] that needs to be highlighted.
[1976.92 → 1982.92] If the question is simply asking, can a person who speaks Arabic call God Allah?
[1982.92 → 1985.92] The answer is yes, of course.
[1985.92 → 1990.92] Just like someone who speaks Spanish can call God Dies, or someone who speaks French can call
[1990.92 → 1993.92] Yahweh God.
[1993.92 → 1998.92] We are called to make disciples of all nations.
[1998.92 → 2002.92] And so using all languages to do so is obviously a must.
[2002.92 → 2008.92] Otherwise, we would not even be able to use the word God right now in our English day to day.
[2008.92 → 2018.92] But, however, if the question turns from language or semantics to entity, then there is a very different answer here.
[2018.92 → 2028.92] The difference between the true God revealed in the Bible and the God of Islam, for example, is not one of simple name, is not one of simple semantics.
[2028.92 → 2037.92] If that is the grounds for this question, if it becomes more than what is a name and becomes what is the doctrine of God, we need to discuss.
[2037.92 → 2043.92] So, this is also a question that does have a very definitive, biblical answer.
[2043.92 → 2049.92] It's also a question that is extremely applicable to the world and the culture that we find ourselves in today.
[2049.92 → 2054.92] So, we're going to read a text from John this morning that answers this question, I believe, quite emphatically.
[2054.92 → 2058.92] And then we're going to look at why this question and answer matters so much for us today.
[2058.92 → 2061.92] So, our text this morning is John 14.
[2061.92 → 2065.92] You can turn in your Bibles to John 14, and we're going to read the first seven verses.
[2065.92 → 2070.92] So, pull out those phones, flip open those Bibles, get one from the back once again.
[2070.92 → 2075.92] If you didn't do it before and felt a little embarrassed, well, now you can do it by yourself, and it won't be embarrassing at all.
[2075.92 → 2077.92] Grab your Bibles, John 14, 1-7.
[2077.92 → 2081.92] Jesus is speaking to his disciples, and he says this.
[2081.92 → 2084.92] Do not let your hearts be troubled.
[2084.92 → 2088.92] You believe in God, believe also in me.
[2088.92 → 2090.92] My Father's house has many rooms.
[2090.92 → 2096.92] If that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you?
[2096.92 → 2105.92] And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me, that you also may be where I am.
[2105.92 → 2109.92] You know the way to the place where I am going.
[2109.92 → 2116.92] Thomas said to him, Lord, we don't know where you're going, so how can we know the way?
[2116.92 → 2122.92] Jesus answered, I am the way and the truth and the life.
[2122.92 → 2126.92] No one comes to the Father except through me.
[2126.92 → 2130.92] If you really know me, you will know my Father as well.
[2130.92 → 2137.92] From now on, you do know him and have seen him.
[2137.92 → 2140.92] Word of the Lord.
[2140.92 → 2145.92] But does the name we call God matter for our salvation?
[2145.92 → 2148.92] Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life.
[2148.92 → 2153.92] No one goes to the Father except through him.
[2153.92 → 2155.92] Jesus is clear here.
[2155.92 → 2159.92] But we'll look at the confusion and how this affects our culture.
[2159.92 → 2162.92] Now, you got a handout this morning that's got a few pictures on you.
[2162.92 → 2165.92] If you are watching from home and don't have that, we apologize.
[2165.92 → 2168.92] Email me and I will send you everything that was supposed to be on the screen today.
[2168.92 → 2170.92] So, feel free to do that now.
[2170.92 → 2180.92] But if you're here today, take a look at your handout now and take a look at the coexist sticker there.
[2180.92 → 2183.92] Now, it's time for the interactive portion of our sermon.
[2183.92 → 2187.92] So, I'm going to ask you a question and I want you to respond by raising your hands in the air.
[2187.92 → 2192.92] How many of you have seen that or a version of that coexist sticker somewhere?
[2192.92 → 2196.92] In a handout, on a car, a bumper sticker, people seen it around?
[2196.92 → 2199.92] Okay, about half the people, maybe a few more are just unwilling to raise their hands.
[2199.92 → 2202.92] But about half the people have seen that.
[2202.92 → 2205.92] It's a fairly popular thing out there.
[2205.92 → 2207.92] Keep your eyes open, you'll see it more and more.
[2207.92 → 2212.92] Now, if all that sticker means, you'll notice that each letter is a different religion in the world.
[2212.92 → 2215.92] If all that sticker means is that we should get along.
[2215.92 → 2220.92] We should be nice and good neighbours to each other regardless of beliefs.
[2220.92 → 2223.92] There's nothing wrong with that sticker then.
[2223.92 → 2226.92] Jesus said, love your neighbour as yourself.
[2226.92 → 2231.92] Coexisting seems to be as low as you can set that love bar.
[2231.92 → 2234.92] So, I think that's okay.
[2234.92 → 2238.92] If it's simply about loving your neighbour, I get it.
[2238.92 → 2244.92] However, in our culture, there is more to this sticker.
[2244.92 → 2247.92] There's some subtext to this sticker.
[2247.92 → 2251.92] Coexisting often means conforming.
[2251.92 → 2257.92] Coexisting has turned into this idea that all religions are basically the same.
[2257.92 → 2262.92] So, as long as you're nice, and you follow the golden rule, and you're kind to the people around you,
[2262.92 → 2267.92] and you don't claim that what you believe is the only truth,
[2267.92 → 2273.92] well, then you will go to heaven or whatever version of happy eternity is to you.
[2273.92 → 2277.92] Coexisting with one another now and forever.
[2277.92 → 2284.92] Now, this way of thinking, this is no matter who you call God, your eternity is determined by your own morality.
[2284.92 → 2288.92] This way of thinking is called religious pluralism.
[2288.92 → 2290.92] I'm going to say that a lot, so let's all say it together.
[2290.92 → 2291.92] Religious pluralism.
[2291.92 → 2293.92] Good.
[2293.92 → 2294.92] We're all listening.
[2294.92 → 2295.92] This is great.
[2295.92 → 2296.92] This is a movement.
[2296.92 → 2301.92] This religious pluralism movement is sort of sweeping the nation.
[2301.92 → 2306.92] Now, atheists, agnostics, many progressive Christians and other Westernized religions,
[2306.92 → 2311.92] they believe that it's not only our job not to judge each other,
[2311.92 → 2316.92] but because we are all trying to be as loving and kind and tolerant as each other,
[2316.92 → 2318.92] we're going to end up in the same place.
[2318.92 → 2320.92] So, again, take a look at your handout.
[2320.92 → 2324.92] You'll see a beautiful picture of a mountain done on Microsoft Paint.
[2324.92 → 2326.92] Way to go, Microsoft Paint.
[2326.92 → 2327.92] It's a beautiful thing, isn't it?
[2327.92 → 2334.92] A religious pluralist believes this, that if you are a decent human being, and you are kind and compassionate to others,
[2334.92 → 2340.92] no matter what God you believe in, or you don't believe in, we are all heading up the same mountain.
[2340.92 → 2342.92] We are just on different paths.
[2342.92 → 2345.92] The trick is we actually can't see those other paths.
[2345.92 → 2349.92] So everyone's going up the same mountain, believing what they believe on different paths.
[2351.92 → 2352.92] And that's what that is.
[2352.92 → 2354.92] Same mountain, different paths.
[2354.92 → 2361.92] Therefore, a religious pluralist would say that it does us no good trying to convince people to switch paths,
[2361.92 → 2364.92] because we're all heading in the same direction.
[2364.92 → 2369.92] We should just accept the fact that we're all heading to the top of the mountain on different paths
[2369.92 → 2375.92] and stop fighting with each other and stop disagreeing with each other and causing hate and divisiveness.
[2375.92 → 2382.92] In fact, trying to convince people that your path is the only way up the mountain is arrogant,
[2382.92 → 2386.92] it's condescending, and like I said, it causes that hate and divisiveness.
[2386.92 → 2394.92] So to claim that your way is the only way is intolerant and hateful to other beliefs.
[2394.92 → 2401.92] To be a religious pluralist is to be very open and very tolerant, very peaceful, very loving to all people.
[2401.92 → 2405.92] And it acknowledges that we can, in fact, coexist together.
[2405.92 → 2407.92] Now this is very attractive.
[2407.92 → 2411.92] This is very on point to our Western ideologies.
[2411.92 → 2415.92] It sounds like adjectives we should be.
[2415.92 → 2418.92] Peaceful, loving, honest, open.
[2418.92 → 2421.92] Perhaps you've even thought like this before.
[2421.92 → 2425.92] I think it's actually very easy to believe this way.
[2425.92 → 2431.92] Because we all know people in our lives, people who don't believe in Jesus,
[2431.92 → 2436.92] but people who we love and people who are good and who are kind and generous
[2436.92 → 2439.92] and they contribute positively to this world around us.
[2439.92 → 2445.92] There are really, perfect people out there who we all love dearly
[2445.92 → 2450.92] and who we all want the best for, both now and for eternity.
[2450.92 → 2453.92] And so this is attractive.
[2453.92 → 2459.92] The problem is, this way of thinking, it just doesn't hold up.
[2459.92 → 2462.92] It doesn't hold up to the Bible, and we're going to get to that.
[2462.92 → 2465.92] It also just doesn't hold up to logic.
[2465.92 → 2470.92] So the logical fallacy of religious pluralism is this.
[2470.92 → 2475.92] A religious pluralist believes that all people worship basically the same God.
[2475.92 → 2477.92] We just use different names.
[2477.92 → 2479.92] And as long as we're good people, we don't try to convince others
[2479.92 → 2482.92] that your way is better than the other way of thinking.
[2482.92 → 2485.92] We will all coexist and live happily ever after.
[2485.92 → 2490.92] To claim your way is the only way is arrogant and intolerant.
[2490.92 → 2493.92] Now hypocrisy, of course, is by claiming this,
[2493.92 → 2498.92] they are saying that their way of understanding religion is the only way to understand religion.
[2498.92 → 2502.92] Their way to view God is the only way to view God.
[2502.92 → 2507.92] A religious pluralist believes that the way they hold up religion is elevated,
[2507.92 → 2511.92] the way that they hold up God is elevated above what other people think,
[2511.92 → 2514.92] above what more traditional religions would say.
[2514.92 → 2521.92] And they are making just as arrogant and, dare I say, intolerant a claim.
[2521.92 → 2528.92] To hold up that mountain idea as the only true way.
[2529.92 → 2532.92] They are doing the exact same thing they are preaching again.
[2532.92 → 2535.92] Does that track? I hope that tracks.
[2535.92 → 2541.92] Second of all, religious pluralism assumes that all religions are the same.
[2541.92 → 2544.92] That we worship the same God but with a different name.
[2544.92 → 2550.92] But the problem is, while people of different languages call God different names,
[2550.92 → 2555.92] it isn't actually the name so much that matters when it comes to worshipping God.
[2555.92 → 2564.92] It's God who matters. It's the being, the entity, the deity of God that we worship that matters.
[2564.92 → 2568.92] And all religions are not worshipping that same God.
[2570.92 → 2573.92] Let me give you an example. I'm borrowing this example from Mike Winger.
[2573.92 → 2574.92] It's a good one.
[2574.92 → 2576.92] So, hypothetically, just hear me out here.
[2576.92 → 2579.92] Hypothetically, let's say you are very new to this church.
[2579.92 → 2581.92] Maybe some of you are, maybe some of you aren't.
[2581.92 → 2583.92] But let's just say you are very new to this church.
[2583.92 → 2585.92] You've actually never really been here before.
[2585.92 → 2589.92] But you know that I, like Kevin Robert, that I exist, and I'm the youth pastor here.
[2589.92 → 2592.92] We've never met, but you know that I am here and I exist.
[2592.92 → 2594.92] You also know that I am married to Nikki.
[2594.92 → 2597.92] And that together we have three daughters together.
[2597.92 → 2600.92] Again, we've never met, but you know this truth is out there.
[2600.92 → 2602.92] You and I, we decide to connect.
[2602.92 → 2606.92] And so we meet at a restaurant where I introduce you to Nikki.
[2606.92 → 2610.92] We have a lovely meal together, and you see Nikki and me, we really love you.
[2610.92 → 2612.92] Nikki and I, we really love each other.
[2612.92 → 2613.92] It's supernatural.
[2613.92 → 2615.92] We share food.
[2615.92 → 2617.92] You see us with our arms around each other.
[2617.92 → 2618.92] We go for a walk afterwards.
[2618.92 → 2620.92] We're holding hands.
[2620.92 → 2625.92] Nikki and I are kind and loving, and we're encouraging to each other all night.
[2625.92 → 2626.92] The perfect couple.
[2626.92 → 2627.92] It's so genuine.
[2627.92 → 2628.92] It's so sincere.
[2628.92 → 2630.92] It's maybe a little on the touchy side.
[2630.92 → 2631.92] But still, it's sweet.
[2631.92 → 2633.92] And you're like, ah, a couple.
[2633.92 → 2635.92] At the end of the night, Nikki has to go home early.
[2635.92 → 2642.92] I kiss her goodbye, and you just sense how happy and sincere our love is.
[2642.92 → 2647.92] The next day, you find out that the woman who joined us for dinner was not my wife Nikki,
[2647.92 → 2652.92] but just another woman named Nikki.
[2652.92 → 2656.92] Was that okay?
[2656.92 → 2658.92] I sensed by the tension in the room that it was not.
[2658.92 → 2659.92] Of course it's not okay.
[2659.92 → 2660.92] That's adultery.
[2660.92 → 2663.92] And I'm reminding you, this is a hypothetical situation.
[2663.92 → 2664.92] This is not.
[2664.92 → 2667.92] I can just see how upset we all are.
[2667.92 → 2669.92] And that's the point.
[2669.92 → 2671.92] That's the point.
[2671.92 → 2678.92] The point is misdirected marital love and devotion to a woman that is not my wife is wrong.
[2678.92 → 2683.92] And the same is true for God.
[2683.92 → 2685.92] It's idolatry.
[2685.92 → 2691.92] When it comes to our heartfelt worship and devotion, there is only one God.
[2691.92 → 2696.92] And that is Yahweh, the God of the Bible, the sovereign God of all the cosmos.
[2696.92 → 2702.92] You cannot worship anything else.
[2702.92 → 2705.92] So yes, who you worship matters.
[2705.92 → 2709.92] The name may change based on your language, but there is only one God.
[2709.92 → 2717.92] And he is the God of the Bible, not the God of the Quran or the sutras or the God of capitalism or socialism or any other ism.
[2717.92 → 2720.92] One God above all else.
[2720.92 → 2724.92] It's not how good you are that matters.
[2724.92 → 2727.92] Who you worship that matters.
[2727.92 → 2734.92] Religious pluralism is rooted in the idea that morality is the foundation of all religion.
[2734.92 → 2735.92] The foundation of all religions.
[2735.92 → 2738.92] Be loving and kind, and you'll be good to go.
[2738.92 → 2741.92] But that's not true with Christianity.
[2741.92 → 2748.92] Christianity is ultimately not about how moral we can be or how good we are.
[2748.92 → 2751.92] It's about knowing how fallen we are.
[2751.92 → 2754.92] About how deprived and sinful we are.
[2754.92 → 2757.92] How no matter what we are always going to fall short.
[2757.92 → 2761.92] Because we are sinful people.
[2761.92 → 2764.92] We are people in need of saving.
[2764.92 → 2769.92] Christianity is about understanding that Jesus saves us from that sin.
[2769.92 → 2773.92] While obedience and good work, yeah, they follow that understanding.
[2773.92 → 2777.92] Ultimately though, Christianity isn't a morality thing.
[2777.92 → 2780.92] It's a salvation through Jesus thing.
[2780.92 → 2782.92] We need Jesus.
[2782.92 → 2787.92] He is the way, the truth, the life.
[2787.92 → 2791.92] The Lord's Day 11 in the Heidelberg Catechism helps us with this.
[2791.92 → 2795.92] It says, either Jesus is not the perfect saviour,
[2795.92 → 2800.92] which means you can be saved by something else, your morality, anything else.
[2800.92 → 2803.92] Either Jesus is not the perfect saviour,
[2803.92 → 2806.92] or those who in faith accept him as their saviour,
[2806.92 → 2810.92] have in him all they need for their salvation.
[2810.92 → 2813.92] You can't believe both.
[2813.92 → 2816.92] It's one or the other.
[2816.92 → 2819.92] Not all religions are the same.
[2819.92 → 2824.92] Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[2824.92 → 2827.92] No one comes to the Father except through me.
[2827.92 → 2828.92] It's only him.
[2828.92 → 2830.92] It's only Jesus.
[2830.92 → 2832.92] There is no other way to God.
[2832.92 → 2833.92] No other way to grace.
[2833.92 → 2837.92] No other way to salvation than through Jesus.
[2837.92 → 2842.92] This massive truth is what separates Christianity from other religions.
[2842.92 → 2843.92] Again, take a look at your papers.
[2843.92 → 2845.92] Flip it over on the other side.
[2845.92 → 2846.92] It'll look like this.
[2846.92 → 2847.92] Again, if you're at home, let me know.
[2847.92 → 2848.92] I'll email it to you.
[2848.92 → 2850.92] There's a little chart here.
[2850.92 → 2853.92] It shows what other religions believe about Jesus
[2853.92 → 2855.92] and what Christianity says about Jesus.
[2855.92 → 2858.92] And you will notice something very quickly.
[2858.92 → 2861.92] We do not believe the same thing about Jesus.
[2861.92 → 2864.92] We are not the same.
[2864.92 → 2868.92] It is Jesus who saves.
[2868.92 → 2869.92] No one else.
[2869.92 → 2871.92] It is Jesus who gives us new life.
[2871.92 → 2872.92] No one else.
[2872.92 → 2874.92] Jesus who offers us salvation.
[2874.92 → 2876.92] No one else.
[2876.92 → 2880.92] It is Jesus who is the Son of God sent by the Father to save us from our sins
[2880.92 → 2884.92] and fulfill God's promises with his people.
[2884.92 → 2888.92] Jesus lived the sinless life that we could not live.
[2888.92 → 2892.92] And he died the death that we all deserved to die.
[2892.92 → 2897.92] Jesus rose again from the grave three days later, defeating sin and death for us all.
[2897.92 → 2901.92] Jesus offers us grace even though we do not deserve it.
[2901.92 → 2909.92] Jesus gives hope to the hopeless, peace to the restless, strength to the weary, and life to us all.
[2909.92 → 2912.92] Because we are all dead in our transgressions.
[2912.92 → 2915.92] John 15 verse 5.
[2915.92 → 2917.92] Jesus is the vine.
[2917.92 → 2918.92] We are the branches.
[2918.92 → 2924.92] If we remain in him, and he does with us, we will bear much fruit.
[2924.92 → 2928.92] But apart from him, we can do nothing.
[2928.92 → 2931.92] Acts 4, 11 to 12.
[2931.92 → 2933.92] Jesus is the stone the builders rejected.
[2933.92 → 2936.92] The stone which has become the cornerstone.
[2936.92 → 2940.92] Salvation is found in no one else.
[2940.92 → 2947.92] For there is no name under the heaven given to mankind by which they can be saved.
[2948.92 → 2950.92] 1 Timothy 2, 5 to 6.
[2950.92 → 2952.92] For there is one God.
[2952.92 → 2955.92] And there is one mediator between God and men.
[2955.92 → 2961.92] The man, Jesus Christ, who gave himself up as a ransom for all.
[2962.92 → 2965.92] But there is no other name that saves.
[2966.92 → 2969.92] Mankind cannot worship any other God.
[2969.92 → 2972.92] All religions are not the same.
[2973.92 → 2976.92] They are not worshipping this Jesus.
[2976.92 → 2980.92] They do not believe in this Jesus.
[2983.92 → 2986.92] Anything else is just dinner with a different girl named Nikki.
[2989.92 → 2991.92] Galatians 2, 20 to 21.
[2991.92 → 2992.92] Paul says this.
[2992.92 → 2993.92] He says,
[2993.92 → 2998.92] For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live for God.
[2999.92 → 3004.92] I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me.
[3004.92 → 3012.92] The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself up for me.
[3013.92 → 3016.92] I do not set aside the grace of God.
[3017.92 → 3023.92] For if righteousness could be gained through the law, then Christ died for nothing.
[3023.92 → 3038.92] If righteousness could be gained through the law, if righteousness could be gained by being good moral people, then Christ died for nothing.
[3038.92 → 3051.92] The salvation Christianity offers is not for good people, but for a people who understand and acknowledge that they are and never will be good enough themselves.
[3052.92 → 3056.92] And they are desperately the need of a Saviour.
[3057.92 → 3058.92] Right.
[3058.92 → 3062.92] I'll land the plane here in a moment.
[3062.92 → 3064.92] Tim Keller wrote this.
[3065.92 → 3066.92] He said,
[3066.92 → 3073.92] No matter how good and well-ordained your life is, you must be born again through Jesus Christ.
[3073.92 → 3085.92] And yet, no matter how chaotic your life has been, or how often and profoundly you have failed, you can be born again.
[3085.92 → 3091.92] Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, the only Saviour in the world.
[3092.92 → 3094.92] He is the way, the truth, the life.
[3095.92 → 3097.92] No one can receive salvation but through him.
[3098.92 → 3104.92] He lived and died and rose again to make salvation a reality to all who believe.
[3104.92 → 3107.92] And that truth sets you free.
[3108.92 → 3113.92] Free from the bondage of sin and the constraints of sin.
[3113.92 → 3114.92] Free from death.
[3114.92 → 3116.92] You are born again.
[3116.92 → 3120.92] Born to bring this news to all who need to hear it.
[3121.92 → 3127.92] Because we should or because we can, but because if this truth is in your heart, you can't share it.
[3127.92 → 3128.92] Double negative, on purpose.
[3128.92 → 3134.92] You can't share this story of faithfulness with the world.
[3135.92 → 3138.92] There are many people in the world who need to hear this news.
[3138.92 → 3141.92] Many people that we love who need to hear this news.
[3141.92 → 3149.92] And we should do so not arrogantly, not intolerantly, but gently and lovingly and persistently with them.
[3150.92 → 3155.92] People need to know how you have been born again in Jesus.
[3155.92 → 3157.92] So let's tell them.
[3158.92 → 3164.92] Let's proudly share our stories and tell the people whom God has entrusted us with loving.
[3165.92 → 3167.92] We know the truth.
[3168.92 → 3171.92] That in Christ alone, our hope is found.
[3172.92 → 3174.92] There is no other name that saves.
[3176.92 → 3177.92] Amen. Please pray with me.
[3177.92 → 3190.92] Father in heaven, there is no other name on heaven or on earth that saves.
[3191.92 → 3194.92] Because Jesus Christ, you are the way, the truth, and the life.
[3194.92 → 3199.92] Lord, may we truly understand that today.
[3199.92 → 3208.92] May we know how sinful we are and how much grace you have for us.
[3209.92 → 3216.92] May we know that we are free from that sin, free from death even, because of your sacrifice on the cross for us.
[3216.92 → 3222.92] And Lord, may we take this news, this truth that we know, and may we share it.
[3223.92 → 3225.92] May we share it with those we love.
[3225.92 → 3226.92] May we share it with those we don't know.
[3227.92 → 3229.92] May we share it with our neighbours.
[3230.92 → 3234.92] Allow us to be bold with this, Lord.
[3235.92 → 3238.92] May we share our stories and the story of your faithfulness to us.
[3238.92 → 3243.92] Because this truth is too good to hold back.
[3243.92 → 3245.92] We pray this in your name. Amen.
[3251.92 → 3253.92] Please rise and join us in song.
[3253.92 → 3263.92] Please rise and join us in song.
[3263.92 → 3269.92] Let us sing.
[3269.92 → 3274.92] Let us sing.
[3275.92 → 3280.92] In Christ alone my hope is found.
[3280.92 → 3285.92] He is my life, my strength, my song
[3286.50 → 3291.88] This cornerstone, this solid ground
[3291.88 → 3296.78] Firm through the fiercest drought and storm
[3296.78 → 3302.04] What heights of love, what depths of peace
[3302.04 → 3307.12] When cares of still and striving sea
[3307.12 → 3312.12] My comforter, my all in all
[3312.88 → 3318.36] Here in the love of Christ I stand
[3318.36 → 3325.44] Christ alone, who took on flesh
[3325.44 → 3330.24] Wholeness of God in helpless way
[3330.24 → 3334.76] His gift of love and righteousness
[3334.76 → 3340.76] Stored by the ones He came to save
[3340.76 → 3346.14] Till on that cross as Jesus died
[3346.14 → 3350.76] The wrath of God was satisfied
[3350.76 → 3356.76] For every sin on Him was laid
[3356.76 → 3362.76] Here in the death of Christ I live
[3362.76 → 3370.14] In the ground His body lay
[3370.14 → 3376.20] Light of the world by darkness slain
[3376.20 → 3382.20] Then bursting forth in glorious day
[3382.20 → 3387.20] Up from the grave He rose again
[3387.20 → 3392.20] And as He stands in victory
[3392.20 → 3397.54] His curse not lost its grip on me
[3397.54 → 3403.20] For I am His, and He is mine
[3403.20 → 3408.20] Hark with the precious blood of Christ
[3408.20 → 3416.20] No guilt in life, no fearing death
[3416.20 → 3421.20] This is the power of Christ in me
[3421.20 → 3426.20] From life's first cry to final breath
[3426.20 → 3431.20] Jesus commands my destiny
[3431.20 → 3437.20] No power of hell, no scheme of man
[3437.20 → 3442.20] Can ever Plough me from His hand
[3442.20 → 3448.20] Till He returns or calls me hope
[3448.20 → 3454.20] Here in the power of Christ I stand
[3454.20 → 3456.20] No power of hell, no promise
[3456.20 → 3461.20] No power of hell, no promise
[3461.20 → 3466.20] Why don't you have a seat together
[3466.20 → 3476.20] It's not so much about the name that you use
[3476.20 → 3481.20] But the identity of the one you worship
[3481.20 → 3485.20] The one whom we worship, our Lord Jesus Christ
[3485.20 → 3489.20] Calls us now to this table
[3489.20 → 3493.20] So if there's confusion about who Jesus is
[3493.20 → 3494.20] Here is clarity
[3494.20 → 3498.20] If there's confusion about what He has done for you
[3498.20 → 3501.20] Here is clarity
[3501.20 → 3507.20] If you don't yet begin to comprehend
[3507.20 → 3512.20] The magnitude, the cross, and the empty tomb
[3512.20 → 3515.20] Here is clarity
[3518.20 → 3523.20] At His Last Supper, our Lord Jesus took bread
[3523.20 → 3527.20] And when He had given thanks, He broke it
[3527.20 → 3531.20] And said, this is my body
[3531.20 → 3533.20] Which is for you
[3533.20 → 3536.20] Do this in remembrance of me
[3536.20 → 3541.20] And in the same way, after supper
[3541.20 → 3543.20] He took the cup
[3543.20 → 3548.20] And He said, this cup is the new covenant in my blood
[3549.20 → 3553.20] Do this in remembrance of me
