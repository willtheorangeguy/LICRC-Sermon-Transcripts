• In times of crisis, people may look for someone or something to rescue them from their circumstances.
• The speaker notes that these actions are not inherently bad and can be beneficial.
• However, the focus shifts towards being one's own hope, rather than relying solely on external sources.

• A proper understanding of fear is that it's an appropriate response to God's mercy and justice
• Peter's epistle emphasizes living with "reverent fear" as exiles, not being controlled by fear of others.
