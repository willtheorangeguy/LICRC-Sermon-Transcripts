[0.00 → 8.72] Well, welcome everyone to the year 2021.
[9.76 → 15.06] I think I can speak on all of us when I say, good riddance 2020.
[15.66 → 20.48] I figured I'd start the year off with a good cool jump kick.
[21.18 → 23.28] 2020 was supposed to be this cool year.
[23.28 → 26.46] When I was 10 years old, I figured that in the year 2020,
[26.46 → 34.62] we would all be working in like flying offices and most of our travel would be done by those tubes that suck you up and just launch you into your next place.
[34.82 → 37.52] And I would be famous on televisions like across the country.
[38.22 → 41.66] But instead, 2020 started with my office getting flooded.
[42.44 → 46.00] My mode of transportation is still just this old dented Toyota matrix.
[46.62 → 52.54] And most of the year we spent dealing with this pandemic that we're all just a little bit too tired discussing.
[53.26 → 55.46] But hey, I'm on TV at least, right?
[56.46 → 60.04] No, all kidding aside, 2020 obviously did not go as planned.
[60.16 → 63.46] And yet, 2021 is now here.
[64.30 → 66.32] Time marches on, as they say.
[66.64 → 71.64] And as we enter into this new calendar year, perhaps very eager to get the old one behind us,
[72.28 → 77.48] it's important for us to be reminded to ground ourselves in the word of God.
[78.34 → 85.70] It's God's word where his promises are revealed, where his salvation is declared, and where our hope is restored.
[85.70 → 90.34] Today, I'd like to read a story that we just heard in Kids Corner.
[90.84 → 93.84] I'd like to read the story about Jesus as a boy.
[93.92 → 98.02] It's the only story of little boy Jesus that we have in our Bible.
[98.08 → 104.62] And I thought since many of us are sort of leaving the Christmas season this week, including the church itself,
[104.62 → 110.26] it would be cool to look at the first story we have of Jesus post-Christmas.
[110.90 → 115.44] The story can be found in Luke chapter 2, verses 41 to 52.
[115.70 → 118.34] It should be on the screen, on your television screens as I read.
[118.40 → 123.54] But I also want to encourage you, again, pull out your Bibles and follow along in your actual Bibles with you.
[123.58 → 128.82] Perhaps even grab a notebook or a journal and take some notes today as we look at this story.
[128.82 → 133.66] If you're not used to doing that, well, it's 2021, and that might be a perfect New Year's resolution.
[133.96 → 137.98] So, Luke 2, verses 41 to 52.
[139.36 → 140.26] It reads like this.
[140.32 → 144.84] Every year, Jesus' parents went to Jerusalem for the festival of the Passover.
[145.36 → 149.24] When he was 12 years old, they went up to the festival according to the customs.
[149.24 → 157.26] After the festival was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem.
[157.92 → 159.14] But they were unaware of it.
[160.26 → 163.06] Thinking he was in their company, they travelled on for a day.
[163.84 → 166.86] Then they began looking for him among their relatives and their friends.
[167.88 → 170.58] When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him.
[170.58 → 179.38] After three days, they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them, and asking them questions.
[180.32 → 183.52] Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers.
[184.38 → 187.94] When his parents saw him, they were astonished.
[188.70 → 189.62] His mother said to him,
[190.20 → 192.76] Son, why have you treated us like this?
[192.80 → 195.78] Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.
[197.22 → 199.08] Why were you searching for me?
[199.08 → 200.08] He asked.
[200.58 → 203.58] Didn't you know I had to be in my father's house?
[204.72 → 207.20] But they did not understand what he was saying to them.
[208.30 → 211.52] Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them.
[211.58 → 214.32] But his mother treasured all these things in her heart.
[215.04 → 220.90] And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature and in favour with God and with men.
[222.06 → 223.20] The reading of the word.
[225.30 → 230.48] Now this would generally be the part of the sermon where the pastor would share this story.
[230.48 → 234.78] How they too have once lost one of their children.
[235.30 → 240.66] They would talk about the day that they left their kid behind at church and didn't notice for three days.
[240.82 → 243.56] And then they went back, and they were reunited at last.
[243.64 → 246.60] And the congregation would cry and applaud the story.
[246.60 → 249.66] And everyone would be connected just a little bit more to this text.
[249.66 → 260.78] Well, I can honestly say with my head held high, even arrogantly so, that Nikki and I have never lost one of our children.
[261.62 → 262.26] Right, Nikki?
[262.26 → 264.68] Where are they, by the way?
[265.66 → 266.14] The kids.
[266.22 → 266.70] Where are the kids?
[267.84 → 269.10] I thought they were with you.
[269.14 → 270.26] I didn't know you were doing Kids Corner.
[271.40 → 272.10] Well, I don't know.
[272.26 → 273.48] Did we leave some Cheerios out at least?
[274.24 → 274.66] You know what?
[274.72 → 276.32] Ruby's very, very capable.
[276.46 → 276.92] She'll be fine.
[276.92 → 286.46] So, even though I don't have a personal story about this, I think it's a story that we can all relate to.
[287.70 → 288.64] I mean, think about it.
[288.66 → 291.10] Put yourself in Mary or in Joseph's shoes for a minute.
[291.82 → 295.24] Missing your kid for three days.
[296.00 → 297.66] That would have been so traumatic.
[297.66 → 304.28] Then, after days spent travelling, going back to the temple and finally reuniting with your son?
[305.04 → 307.22] Man, what a relief.
[308.12 → 317.58] I could picture Mary's face now, just tears changing shape from sadness to joy, being both confused and shocked and relieved all at once.
[318.72 → 319.54] I mean, what a scene.
[319.60 → 320.48] It's quite the story.
[322.50 → 324.92] Losing a kid for three days, that's fascinating.
[326.02 → 327.12] It's terrifying.
[328.40 → 334.68] Now, that journey, that journey to the temple that they took, that was nothing unusual for Joseph to do.
[334.76 → 344.20] In Exodus 34, we read how all the male Israelites were told to go and make that pilgrimage to Jerusalem three times a year for the various feasts.
[344.26 → 346.40] For Passover, for Pentecost, and for the tabernacles.
[346.70 → 350.86] Now, this was one of those trips, and the family went along with them.
[351.32 → 355.42] Jesus went with them as a 12-year-old boy, which is important because he was not 13,
[355.42 → 358.60] which was the age that you became a man in Jewish custom.
[359.24 → 364.60] Now, this journey that they walked on was 100, it was actually over 100 kilometres long.
[365.14 → 367.42] That is a long walk for a family with small kids.
[367.50 → 372.48] I mean, if you've ever walked four kilometres, even four kilometres, with small children, you know what that's like.
[372.94 → 374.68] Imagine walking 100 with them.
[374.68 → 379.24] This group of people that made up Joseph's family also had to have been large.
[379.24 → 384.76] Because it was so big that Mary and Joseph travelled for a whole day thinking that he was in their company.
[385.66 → 386.92] It actually got me thinking a little bit.
[387.28 → 393.08] The biggest Mexico missions trip that I've ever been on with this church was done pretty quick when I got here.
[393.30 → 395.00] And that was 50 people large.
[395.10 → 401.10] There was 37 youth and 13 leaders trucking all the way down across two borders all the way to Tijuana.
[401.98 → 404.46] And not one person in that group was over the age of 30.
[404.46 → 412.76] So you can all believe me when I say, in a group that size, it is very, very easy to forget a couple of kids here and there.
[413.46 → 414.36] They get lost in the shuffle.
[415.34 → 415.68] I'm kidding.
[416.12 → 416.54] I'm kidding.
[416.68 → 417.62] All those youth came home.
[418.18 → 422.24] We always have rigorous buddy systems and thorough van checks, and they all came home that year.
[422.92 → 424.20] Please keep sending your kids to youth.
[424.68 → 425.08] I digress.
[425.18 → 429.98] All of this today, while Jesus being lost for three days is fascinating,
[429.98 → 436.02] and it's central to this story, is not the actual point of this story.
[436.82 → 441.10] Notice in our text today, Luke actually doesn't go into much detail about Jesus being absent.
[441.34 → 442.32] Just that it happened.
[442.96 → 444.68] We don't know where Jesus would have eaten.
[444.82 → 446.22] We don't know where he would have slept.
[446.48 → 449.66] We don't know how he would have functioned for three days without his parents.
[450.18 → 453.38] And the reason we don't know these details is that Luke doesn't mention them,
[453.44 → 455.22] because they don't matter to the story.
[455.22 → 460.82] While it's fascinating to think about, the details of him being lost aren't the point.
[462.48 → 467.58] Just that he was left alone in the temple for three days or so.
[468.50 → 470.98] And that's another fascinating point of this story, isn't it?
[471.02 → 477.04] Jesus hung out with priests and religious leaders for three days as a 12-year-old boy.
[478.36 → 482.60] Notice, though, what Jesus did among these scholars.
[483.30 → 485.18] Verse 46, read it along with me.
[485.22 → 488.06] After three days, they, which is Mary and Joseph,
[488.50 → 491.40] after three days they found him in the temple courts,
[492.22 → 498.08] sitting among the teachers, listening to them, and asking them questions.
[500.22 → 502.76] For those of us who have heard this story before,
[503.14 → 505.96] I think the picture we sometimes mentally paint
[505.96 → 509.66] is that Jesus is standing there preaching to these religious leaders.
[509.66 → 512.82] We have this idea of Jesus standing on a pedestal of sorts,
[512.82 → 516.06] waving his hands and wagging his fingers at all these leaders,
[516.06 → 520.32] and these religious leaders sitting there, wide-eyed, hands on their fists,
[520.54 → 522.76] just absorbing what Jesus is saying.
[523.88 → 525.80] But that's not what Luke describes here.
[527.24 → 530.30] According to Luke, Jesus was there, but he was sitting.
[531.10 → 532.38] He was the one asking.
[532.54 → 533.62] He was the one learning.
[533.62 → 538.48] He wanted to grow and understand and hear the teachers.
[539.48 → 543.00] Luke tells us that Jesus went with this eagerness to learn,
[543.52 → 545.68] perhaps even with a simplicity of spirit.
[547.12 → 548.26] He was still a boy.
[548.34 → 549.34] He was still studying.
[549.34 → 553.22] In most Bibles, the title to this text,
[553.32 → 554.74] perhaps even in yours at home you can look,
[554.94 → 556.12] the title to this text is
[556.12 → 558.42] The Boy Jesus Teaching in the Temple.
[559.80 → 561.76] But really, a more accurate title would be
[561.76 → 564.84] The Boy Jesus Learning in the Temple.
[566.92 → 567.80] Jesus was a kid.
[567.88 → 569.92] He was learning as kids learn,
[569.98 → 571.08] by asking questions,
[571.80 → 572.60] and by discovering.
[573.14 → 575.14] Now, he was wise.
[575.14 → 579.36] The teachers were amazed at his questions, we read.
[579.42 → 581.72] They were amazed at his understanding.
[582.08 → 583.86] They were amazed at his answer.
[584.94 → 588.80] Jesus was wise, and his wisdom grew as he did.
[590.92 → 592.82] Another thing that's crazy, if you think about it,
[592.84 → 594.22] is that this group of leaders
[594.22 → 597.82] that were so amazed by this 12-year-old boy
[597.82 → 600.62] would end up being the same group of leaders
[600.62 → 602.40] that wanted him nailed to that cross.
[605.14 → 606.22] But brothers and sisters,
[607.36 → 609.64] that's not even the point of this story.
[610.74 → 614.64] This is not a story of a lost boy or a wise child.
[615.78 → 617.88] We find the point of this story
[617.88 → 622.12] where the narration ends and the dialogue begins.
[623.50 → 627.48] Verses 48 and 49 become the climax of this story,
[627.58 → 629.50] and it's this little back and forth
[629.50 → 631.40] between Mary and Jesus
[631.40 → 634.18] that becomes so important for us today,
[634.18 → 637.58] even as we begin the year 2021 together.
[638.50 → 639.92] Read those two verses with me.
[640.16 → 642.28] Verses 48 and 49.
[642.68 → 643.08] They say,
[643.46 → 644.90] When his parents saw him,
[645.32 → 646.62] they were astonished.
[647.44 → 648.48] His mother said to him,
[648.88 → 651.74] Son, why have you treated us like this?
[652.04 → 653.16] Your father and I
[653.16 → 655.40] have been anxiously searching for you.
[657.64 → 659.34] Why were you searching for me?
[660.02 → 660.84] Jesus asks.
[660.84 → 665.42] Didn't you know I had to be about my father's business?
[665.86 → 669.00] Didn't you know I had to be in my father's house?
[669.48 → 669.94] That's it.
[670.14 → 671.70] That's the central cog to the story.
[671.98 → 673.88] The piece that is so important for us today.
[674.30 → 674.70] Mary says,
[674.78 → 675.82] Why did you stay behind?
[676.14 → 676.84] Your father and I,
[676.90 → 677.80] we were so worried.
[678.16 → 678.74] And Jesus says,
[678.78 → 679.44] Why were you worried?
[680.54 → 682.44] Didn't you know I had to be in my father's house?
[683.02 → 684.28] Or some translations say,
[684.44 → 686.38] Didn't you know I had to be about my father's business?
[686.38 → 690.64] Whether it was his father's house or his father's business,
[690.82 → 692.38] doesn't matter so much.
[692.46 → 696.74] What's important is that the 12-year-old boy,
[697.14 → 697.50] Jesus,
[698.12 → 702.90] acknowledged that his father was God.
[702.90 → 706.40] This was a boy, yes.
[706.60 → 711.04] But it was a boy that knew that God was his father.
[712.24 → 716.78] This passage is about Jesus' divine son ship,
[716.90 → 718.14] more than anything else.
[718.86 → 722.22] It's not necessarily about Mary and Joseph's forgetting Jesus at the temple.
[722.48 → 725.84] It's not necessarily about Jesus' learning at the feet of the Jewish leaders.
[726.06 → 729.30] And it's not necessarily about the Jewish leaders' response
[729.30 → 731.16] and amazement at Jesus' wisdom.
[731.16 → 735.28] All of those things are important and lead to this moment,
[735.48 → 738.98] this little conversation between Jesus and Mary,
[739.40 → 745.10] this little but crucial moment where Jesus announces that God is his father
[745.10 → 752.92] and that his identity is rooted in the fact that he is God's son.
[755.34 → 759.56] In fact, the words that Jesus speaks in this passage here
[759.56 → 763.58] are the first recorded words of Jesus that we have in our Bibles.
[764.66 → 769.06] Everything he does from this point on is guided by these words.
[770.68 → 773.32] His life, as exemplified in this story,
[773.38 → 779.28] was completely directed by the unique relationship that he had with God his father.
[779.28 → 787.54] Jesus was fully human, but he was also fully cognizant that God was his father.
[789.18 → 795.12] Jesus' identity was rooted in his divine son ship.
[795.12 → 797.12] Jesus' identity was rooted in his father.
[797.12 → 798.64] So what about you?
[800.00 → 803.90] What is your identity rooted in?
[806.40 → 811.66] I think often we root our identities in the accomplishments that we've achieved,
[811.90 → 813.38] in the things that we do.
[813.38 → 819.14] I am Kevin, youth pastor at Langley Emanuel CRC, student at Acts Seminary,
[819.62 → 822.10] co-founder of Reactivate Youth Conference.
[823.16 → 825.20] The things we do, the accomplishments we have.
[826.14 → 830.14] Other times we root our identities in our earthly relationships, right?
[830.22 → 833.38] I am Kevin, son of Murray and Helen, brother of Dennis and Justine,
[833.70 → 835.76] husband of Nicky, father of Eden, Isla Ruby.
[835.76 → 842.98] There's a problem with rooting our identities in the things we achieve
[842.98 → 845.20] or in the people that we love.
[846.64 → 848.98] The problem is those things are finite.
[850.68 → 854.84] If I'm no longer the youth pastor here, am I still Kevin?
[856.42 → 859.68] If Reactivate doesn't happen, am I still Kevin?
[859.68 → 859.78] Kevin?
[859.78 → 866.94] If the relationships I have with my family or my friends suddenly end,
[867.02 → 870.96] if my parents or my spouse suddenly and sadly pass away,
[871.34 → 872.82] am I still me?
[876.94 → 879.76] If we root our identities in these earthly things,
[879.82 → 881.60] when life's turbulence hits,
[881.80 → 884.54] as it did for so many of us last year in 2020,
[885.40 → 888.40] the danger is our identities start to waver too.
[888.40 → 893.22] When that happens, we find ourselves in the middle of an identity crisis.
[894.72 → 896.28] Brothers and sisters, our identities,
[896.46 → 900.60] they need to be rooted in something so much more secure
[900.60 → 904.10] and something way more permanent than the things we do
[904.10 → 907.86] or the worldviews we have or the people that we love.
[908.96 → 910.64] I know that that sounds maybe a bit harsh,
[910.98 → 913.94] but it's the example Jesus sets for us here in this story.
[914.32 → 916.94] His identity was not part of Mary and Joseph's family.
[916.94 → 922.70] But that he was God's son, and he was about his father's business.
[924.86 → 927.86] Our identities need to be rooted in Christ.
[929.38 → 932.32] Now perhaps many of you long-time Christians have heard this before,
[932.34 → 934.82] and this answer, it might not be the big punch to the gut
[934.82 → 937.06] that maybe some of you desire in a sermon,
[937.06 → 940.14] but I hope that the magnitude of this truth
[940.14 → 944.22] just may sink in a little bit deeper for you today.
[945.22 → 947.70] Your identity is in Christ.
[948.08 → 951.32] You are a child of the living God.
[951.44 → 954.32] God has claimed you as his own.
[954.32 → 958.64] Sometimes this can be challenging.
[958.76 → 960.48] This can be hard because God's claims
[960.48 → 964.40] can stand in open conflict with your earthly desires.
[964.54 → 967.04] Sometimes God's claim on your life
[967.04 → 969.48] will affect your loyalty to your family
[969.48 → 971.56] or your social standing
[971.56 → 973.62] or your economic prosperity.
[975.20 → 978.86] Sometimes that's the cost of belonging to God.
[978.86 → 983.62] Jesus here puts God the Father above all,
[984.50 → 985.54] including his own mother.
[986.50 → 988.72] And by doing so, he shows the world
[988.72 → 990.62] who his identity is rooted in
[990.62 → 993.06] and sets an example for us all to follow.
[994.82 → 998.30] Notice his love and his obedience for his mother do not change.
[998.30 → 1003.08] But God is still who he roots his identity in.
[1004.52 → 1006.58] Your identity is not the job you do.
[1006.84 → 1008.28] It's not the school you go to.
[1008.42 → 1010.96] Not the things you know, the hobbies you partake in,
[1011.14 → 1013.60] or even the family or the friends that you have.
[1013.86 → 1016.50] Your identity isn't found travelling the world
[1016.50 → 1019.78] or rebelling against some social system that you disagree with.
[1020.14 → 1021.22] Jobs change.
[1021.64 → 1023.38] Schools finish one way or the other.
[1023.78 → 1025.58] Hobbies come and hobbies go.
[1025.92 → 1026.94] Trips get cancelled.
[1026.94 → 1028.80] Picket lines end.
[1029.70 → 1033.42] Your identity is so much more secure than that.
[1035.02 → 1036.94] Your identity is in Christ.
[1037.68 → 1039.40] You are a child of God,
[1039.70 → 1041.06] created in his image
[1041.06 → 1046.10] and co-heirs to the eternal glory with Christ.
[1048.74 → 1049.58] Romans 8,
[1049.64 → 1051.58] For those who are led by the Spirit of God
[1051.58 → 1054.28] are the children of God.
[1054.58 → 1056.74] The Spirit you receive does not make you slaves
[1056.74 → 1057.98] so that you live in fear again.
[1057.98 → 1064.02] Rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to son ship.
[1064.78 → 1065.84] And by him, we cry,
[1066.04 → 1066.94] Abba, Father,
[1067.02 → 1068.48] which we sang earlier today.
[1069.20 → 1071.58] The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit
[1071.58 → 1074.40] that we are God's children.
[1074.40 → 1076.54] Now, if we are children,
[1076.54 → 1078.10] then we are heirs.
[1078.60 → 1082.34] Heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ.
[1083.04 → 1089.32] If indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory.
[1089.32 → 1093.58] That's the truth that Paul proclaims in Romans 8.
[1095.42 → 1098.88] Our identities are rooted in Christ,
[1098.96 → 1102.88] meaning we share in his glory.
[1102.88 → 1107.58] We are all sons of God,
[1107.68 → 1109.54] adopted into son ship,
[1109.94 → 1111.38] as Romans puts it.
[1111.82 → 1112.34] Now, just quickly,
[1112.44 → 1114.74] for those of you who want me to say we are sons and daughters of God,
[1115.24 → 1117.64] that does God's inheritance a bit of a disservice.
[1117.78 → 1118.58] Back when this was written,
[1119.02 → 1122.24] firstborn sons were the ones who inherited what the Father rules over.
[1122.24 → 1124.14] And so when God calls all of us,
[1124.58 → 1126.22] brothers and sisters alike,
[1126.78 → 1127.48] his sons,
[1127.88 → 1129.68] and adopt us into his son ship,
[1130.78 → 1134.68] that means we are all co-heirs with Christ,
[1135.10 → 1137.46] of God's eternal inheritance.
[1137.90 → 1141.22] Just like men need to be okay with being the bride of Christ,
[1141.54 → 1146.46] women embrace that you are being adopted into the son ship with God.
[1147.10 → 1149.66] And when we embrace that identity,
[1149.66 → 1152.98] all the eternal glory that comes with it,
[1154.12 → 1157.46] our identities are rooted into something so much greater
[1157.46 → 1159.12] and so much more permanent
[1159.12 → 1161.50] that it will never waver.
[1161.92 → 1163.08] It will never end.
[1163.12 → 1163.70] It is forever.
[1164.16 → 1164.98] More than your work,
[1165.10 → 1165.88] more than your school,
[1166.60 → 1167.36] more than your trips,
[1168.10 → 1168.86] more than your family.
[1170.08 → 1171.18] That's why Jesus,
[1171.82 → 1172.56] little Jesus,
[1172.72 → 1173.72] 12-year-old Jesus,
[1174.16 → 1176.48] can look his mother in the eye and simply say,
[1177.24 → 1178.20] didn't you know
[1178.20 → 1181.14] I had to be about my Father's business?
[1184.42 → 1186.52] We too need to be about our Father's business,
[1186.62 → 1186.92] don't we?
[1186.96 → 1189.18] Not necessarily because he commands us to,
[1189.88 → 1190.78] though that is true,
[1191.46 → 1194.52] but because we are sons of God.
[1194.60 → 1196.80] We are co-heirs with Christ.
[1197.54 → 1198.78] That is who we are.
[1199.88 → 1201.02] That's our identity.
[1201.26 → 1202.76] That means that the things we do,
[1202.76 → 1206.26] we do not do because we are morally obliged to do them,
[1206.58 → 1210.72] but rather it's because it is who we are.
[1211.60 → 1213.82] It is because of who we are
[1213.82 → 1215.82] that we should live the lives of love,
[1215.94 → 1217.88] that we should live lives seeking justice
[1217.88 → 1219.10] or loving mercy,
[1219.46 → 1220.50] forgiving others.
[1220.80 → 1222.96] We are to go and make disciples of all nations.
[1223.10 → 1224.54] We're to pray and to teach
[1224.54 → 1226.82] and to live our lives under the umbrella
[1226.82 → 1230.40] that we belong to God.
[1230.40 → 1234.10] We must be about our Father's business
[1234.10 → 1235.72] because that's who we are.
[1238.08 → 1238.64] Furthermore,
[1239.44 → 1241.22] our identities in Christ
[1241.22 → 1242.72] are not something that we achieve.
[1243.62 → 1245.38] We don't do anything for them.
[1246.50 → 1248.52] Rather, they're something that we have received
[1248.52 → 1250.94] through the grace, mercy, and love
[1250.94 → 1251.84] of Christ
[1251.84 → 1254.00] and his death and his resurrection.
[1255.18 → 1256.86] The only thing we contributed
[1256.86 → 1258.56] to that salvation that we received
[1258.56 → 1259.96] was our sin.
[1259.96 → 1263.54] And Christ defeated that once and for all
[1263.54 → 1265.86] when he broke forth from the tomb.
[1266.70 → 1270.22] Our salvation in Christ is secure,
[1270.82 → 1273.74] which means we can rest assured
[1273.74 → 1275.66] that our identities in him
[1275.66 → 1277.44] are equally secure.
[1279.80 → 1281.06] Brothers and sisters,
[1281.44 → 1282.92] Jesus acknowledged his identity,
[1283.10 → 1283.64] his purpose,
[1283.96 → 1284.56] his mission
[1284.56 → 1287.90] by affirming his son ship to God.
[1287.90 → 1290.16] May we do the same.
[1290.90 → 1292.54] May we affirm that we are sons of God
[1292.54 → 1295.48] and that we belong both body and soul
[1295.48 → 1297.46] in life and in death
[1297.46 → 1299.60] to our faithful Saviour,
[1300.06 → 1300.90] Jesus Christ,
[1301.56 → 1303.82] which again we read this morning together.
[1304.88 → 1305.78] So to close,
[1306.02 → 1307.42] let us not root our identities
[1307.42 → 1308.58] in the things of this world.
[1308.94 → 1310.56] Your identity should not be built
[1310.56 → 1312.14] on the foundation of your job
[1312.14 → 1314.16] or the hobbies that you partake in
[1314.16 → 1315.98] or the relations you have in this world
[1315.98 → 1317.88] because those things can change
[1317.88 → 1319.00] with the tides.
[1320.06 → 1321.60] Instead, know that your identity
[1321.60 → 1323.26] is rooted in Christ
[1323.26 → 1325.08] and the eternal glory
[1325.08 → 1327.18] that he obtained with his death
[1327.18 → 1328.48] and his resurrection.
[1329.24 → 1331.12] That is forever.
[1331.12 → 1334.62] And in that knowledge,
[1335.02 → 1336.36] let us live our lives
[1336.36 → 1337.66] knowing who we are,
[1338.46 → 1340.22] sons of the living God.
[1341.22 → 1342.46] May our actions,
[1342.62 → 1343.96] our comings and our goings,
[1344.00 → 1344.52] our speaking,
[1344.70 → 1345.16] our listening,
[1345.28 → 1346.08] our thinking,
[1347.08 → 1348.08] may it all reflect
[1348.08 → 1349.28] our identity in Christ.
[1350.48 → 1351.90] And may we live this out
[1351.90 → 1352.54] in the world
[1352.54 → 1354.08] that we have been placed in.
[1355.44 → 1356.00] That way,
[1356.08 → 1358.90] no matter what 2021 may bring,
[1358.90 → 1360.84] when we go about
[1360.84 → 1361.80] our Father's business,
[1361.94 → 1363.76] confident that our identities
[1363.76 → 1365.30] are rooted solely in him
[1365.30 → 1366.96] and his promises to us,
[1367.70 → 1368.76] no surprises,
[1368.96 → 1369.50] no losses,
[1369.64 → 1370.38] no pandemic
[1370.38 → 1372.70] can uproot us
[1372.70 → 1374.44] from that.
[1375.44 → 1377.54] We can live secure.
[1377.80 → 1379.72] We can die secure
[1379.72 → 1381.72] knowing that we belong
[1381.72 → 1383.56] both body and soul
[1383.56 → 1386.02] in life and in death
[1386.02 → 1387.34] to Christ,
[1387.84 → 1388.48] our Saviour.
[1389.76 → 1390.92] And if anything,
[1391.44 → 1394.56] on this third day of 2021,
[1394.98 → 1396.62] we can remember this,
[1397.36 → 1398.28] that truly,
[1399.16 → 1400.98] that is our only comfort
[1400.98 → 1403.90] in life and in death.
[1404.42 → 1404.66] Amen.
[1405.00 → 1405.94] Please let me pray with you.
[1408.68 → 1409.74] Father in heaven,
[1410.02 → 1410.82] we are grateful
[1410.82 → 1411.90] for this text today,
[1412.14 → 1413.36] grateful for this story
[1413.36 → 1415.00] of Jesus as a boy
[1415.00 → 1418.36] affirming his divine son ship.
[1418.36 → 1419.58] And Lord,
[1419.64 → 1420.56] everything he did
[1420.56 → 1421.36] in his life
[1421.36 → 1423.20] was out of that knowledge
[1423.20 → 1424.20] that he was your son.
[1425.52 → 1425.98] God,
[1426.04 → 1426.92] may we be convicted
[1426.92 → 1427.50] of this same.
[1427.58 → 1428.58] May we acknowledge
[1428.58 → 1429.86] our son ship,
[1429.92 → 1430.82] that we are co-heirs
[1430.82 → 1431.42] with Christ
[1431.42 → 1432.84] because of what he did
[1432.84 → 1434.08] on the cross
[1434.08 → 1435.34] and coming forth
[1435.34 → 1435.90] from the tomb,
[1435.98 → 1437.24] that we are co-heirs
[1437.24 → 1437.82] with him.
[1437.82 → 1441.30] Lord,
[1441.36 → 1441.94] may we root
[1441.94 → 1442.76] our identities
[1442.76 → 1443.88] in that knowledge,
[1444.10 → 1445.18] root our identities
[1445.18 → 1446.22] in Christ,
[1447.12 → 1448.04] and may we
[1448.04 → 1449.62] be about our
[1449.62 → 1450.36] Father's business
[1450.36 → 1451.04] in this world.
[1451.16 → 1452.02] May we go out
[1452.02 → 1453.42] knowing that is who we are
[1453.42 → 1454.52] and we do the things
[1454.52 → 1455.80] that you call us to do
[1455.80 → 1456.80] because of our identities.
[1457.86 → 1458.84] And may that
[1458.84 → 1459.86] not shake us
[1459.86 → 1461.18] no matter what
[1461.18 → 1462.72] 2021 throws at us.
[1462.72 → 1463.78] We pray this all
[1463.78 → 1464.62] in your son's
[1464.62 → 1466.36] precious and holy name.
[1467.30 → 1467.62] Amen.
