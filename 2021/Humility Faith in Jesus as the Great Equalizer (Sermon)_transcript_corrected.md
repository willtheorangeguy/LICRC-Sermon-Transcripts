[0.00 → 7.80] in just a moment we are going to read together from James continuing in our teaching series
[7.80 → 12.68] through that letter we're going to read verse 9 through 11 and so if you have a Bible I encourage
[12.68 → 18.30] you to grab that or open it or turn it on whatever the case may be and have that with you as we go
[18.30 → 23.92] through this text before we do that let me just say because people have been texting me already
[23.92 → 30.18] I know that the video didn't work, and we know that here as well there was an audio issue and so
[30.18 → 36.56] instead of listening to three minutes of silence we will fix that and get the video out for everyone
[36.56 → 43.00] next week, and we'll make it happen there, so thank you for your patience in that and I trust that you
[43.00 → 49.70] also have James 1 open in front of you I'm going to read that just those three verses 9 through 11
[53.92 → 61.24] the brother in humble circumstances ought to take pride in his position but the one who is rich
[61.24 → 68.54] should take pride in his low position because he will pass away like a wild flower for the sun rises
[68.54 → 74.58] with scorching heat and withers the plant its blossom falls, and its beauty is destroyed
[74.58 → 83.34] in the same way the rich man will fade even while he goes about his business this is the word of the
[83.34 → 94.76] lord, and so I want to begin this morning just by saying it's been a good ride I've been here just over
[94.76 → 101.04] two months now and you guys have been incredible and encouraging and really supportive in the work
[101.04 → 110.20] and for some of you today that ends and that ends because some of you are going to be upset about
[110.20 → 117.96] what I'm about to say some of you will be challenged others will be exposed some of you will just
[117.96 → 123.48] disregard it because what I'm saying is hitting too close to home and to your heart, and you don't want
[123.48 → 129.94] it to apply to you and I know that that is true because it is true every single time a pastor talks about
[129.94 → 130.82] money
[130.82 → 135.62] it's going to cost me something
[135.62 → 142.42] to have this theological conversation with you about money
[142.42 → 152.42] and I know that and to be honest and to understand where I'm coming from I'm really at root more
[152.42 → 155.16] concerned with what it will cost me if I don't
[155.16 → 162.26] right if I only preach what itching ears want to hear right it's going to cost me more in the long
[162.26 → 167.84] run it'll cost me more with you, and it will cost me more eternally as a teacher of the word of God
[167.84 → 175.06] right I faithfully want to represent God's word and present it to you
[175.06 → 184.60] and so if you get angry or perhaps when you get angry I get it and if you are convicted
[184.60 → 190.96] to be honest I thank God for that and if you want to follow up with me call me on Tuesday
[190.96 → 197.46] but know this in the midst of all of this I am preaching to myself first
[197.46 → 204.90] God has been convicting me in this message all week long to the point where it was really hard
[204.90 → 210.22] to write this message and at 9 20 this morning when Pastor Kevin came into the church, and he said
[210.22 → 214.32] what are you doing I said I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to cut this thing or change this thing
[214.32 → 220.54] or make it right because I still haven't quite landed it, and so I still haven't landed it I'm going
[220.54 → 222.86] to land it with you live, and we'll see what happens
[222.86 → 230.08] what I'm saying in all of this really is that I'm kind of inviting you into what God has been
[230.08 → 236.98] convicting me of, and I pray that you get something out of it and that this conversation about money and
[236.98 → 245.12] wealth and systems of wealth can be used by God to make our faith real
[245.12 → 255.02] now in this series in James we are looking at what it means to be hearers and doers of the word of God
[255.02 → 262.92] we are looking at how we can make it real right how do people who say they are Christians live
[262.92 → 269.92] like what they say they believe is actually true right you get what I'm saying when I say that right
[269.92 → 276.62] what would be different about your life if you actually lived what you say you believe
[276.62 → 284.22] and so as Christians right for instance we say we believe that the Bible is true that the Bible is
[284.22 → 290.00] authoritative and infallible but how good are we, and maybe I should just speak personally how good am I
[290.00 → 297.66] at putting limits on the scope of its application on creatively using hermeneutical gymnastics
[297.66 → 302.98] to make these texts or other texts apply to other people but not to me
[302.98 → 311.12] right as Christians we say we believe in God's plan for our lives that his design and his purpose
[311.12 → 320.56] are actually the best way for us to live but how often do laziness or apathy or selfishness actually
[320.56 → 327.64] get in the way of conforming our lives to God's creational structure and the redeemed direction he has
[327.64 → 336.90] right we say that God's power is made perfect in weakness right that true greatness comes in the form of being a servant
[336.90 → 342.06] but how many of us actually live to serve and love humility
[342.06 → 350.54] instead are we not just so often and regularly caught up in the western story of securing our own power
[350.54 → 361.80] and peace through status as kings and queens of our own domains right we believe that God has given us the Holy Spirit in power and purpose
[361.80 → 373.80] but then we rely entirely on our own strength and our own prowess to get stuff done right our vision for what could be in our life and in our activities together
[373.80 → 380.80] together become small and narrow and ultimately self-centred
[380.80 → 384.80] because it is entirely self-directed
[384.80 → 387.80] instead
[387.80 → 389.80] imagine
[389.80 → 392.08] what it might look like
[392.08 → 396.50] if you were the kind of Christian who took God at his word
[396.50 → 398.50] and then lived it every day
[398.50 → 408.50] imagine what our church would look like if we actually lived the profession that perfect love drives out fear
[408.50 → 411.50] imagine what your neighbourhood or what
[411.50 → 417.76] Maryville or what Langley or the Fraser Valley would look like if you really loved your neighbour as yourself
[417.76 → 421.76] that's what being a hearer and doer does
[421.76 → 424.76] that's how you make it real
[424.76 → 426.76] and for James
[426.76 → 428.76] in this letter
[428.76 → 442.76] one of the first points of conflict between living out the story of the world or living out the story of the gospel of making our faith real is the language that we're using here of being here and do
[442.76 → 449.76] one of those first points of conflict is all about a Christian's attitude towards money and wealth
[449.76 → 461.76] it shouldn't surprise us right that James takes this up as the first point of conflict in the struggle to make it real
[461.76 → 465.76] James is a brother of Jesus
[465.76 → 471.76] James probably didn't become a disciple of Jesus until after the resurrection
[471.76 → 472.76] but
[472.76 → 479.76] he quickly emerges as a leader of the Christians in Jerusalem alongside of Peter and the apostles
[479.76 → 488.76] right in Acts 15 when Paul comes to Jerusalem to talk to Peter and the apostles James is there as one of the leaders who speaks for the assembly and directs it
[488.76 → 501.76] right it seems clear both from the stories in Acts but also here in the letter that he writes that James was a devout Jew beforehand, and he knows the scriptures well as a devout Jew
[501.76 → 511.76] and it seems clear that in addition to that he is very clear on the teachings of Jesus especially when it comes to money
[511.76 → 528.76] so just to make this point abundantly clear in the gospels Jesus speaks 38 parables 16 of them are about money and possessions
[528.76 → 535.76] in the gospels one out of every 10 verses deals directly with money
[535.76 → 550.76] the Bible has 500 verses on prayer less than 500 verses on faith but more than 2000 verses about money and possessions
[550.76 → 559.76] why is there so much talk about money and possession about wealth and our attitudes towards wealth and riches and poverty
[559.76 → 567.76] it's because Jesus understands the tremendous influence that money and wealth have in our lives
[567.76 → 576.76] right Jesus said for where your treasure is there your heart will be also, and maybe it sounds trite, but you love what you love
[576.76 → 586.76] right and you are what you love, and you become like what you love and the problem that we face or the struggle that we face is that the world around us
[586.76 → 593.76] and our sinful tendencies within us constantly prop up competing loves for our hearts to follow after
[593.76 → 610.76] there's a study done a few years ago by the Barn group that found that 50 percent of Christians consider money to be the primary indicator of success
[610.76 → 617.76] and I would guess that the other 50 percent were found to be liars
[617.76 → 627.76] that same study found that 20 percent of Christians believe you can tell how successful a person is by examining the stuff they have
[627.76 → 637.76] and so really practically here to make this point how many times do we in the church think that a person will make a good elder
[637.76 → 642.76] a good elder because they're a good business person because they run their own business
[642.76 → 650.76] right they might be a good elder, and they might run their own business but running your own business doesn't make you a good elder as a consequence
[652.76 → 665.76] James does not miss the emphasis of Jesus on money and possessions and so here's James point and here's where we will zoom in
[665.76 → 678.76] what you think about wealth and money is directly determined by what you think the crown of life is
[678.76 → 682.76] I'm using some language here we'll get into that in a moment
[682.76 → 688.76] but what you think about wealth and money is directly determined by what you think the crown of life is
[688.76 → 694.76] and that phrase crown of life with your Bibles in front of you can find it in verse 12.
[694.76 → 695.76] We didn't read it.
[695.76 → 697.76] Verse 12 says,
[697.76 → 708.76] Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial because when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him.
[708.76 → 717.76] And blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because when they have stood the test they will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those of love him.
[717.76 → 721.76] And so let's put that too in a little bit of context.
[721.76 → 727.76] So hold on to verse 12 in your mind or put your finger on it if you have it in front of you and then look back to verse 2.
[727.76 → 728.76] Right? Verse 2 says,
[728.76 → 729.76] Right?
[729.76 → 747.76] So in short the text that we read verses 9 through 11 is bracketed by a discussion about trials and testing.
[747.76 → 748.76] Right?
[748.76 → 754.76] James is saying that the first test of whether your faith is real is what you think about money and wealth.
[754.76 → 766.76] Being a hearer and doer in the face of this trial is to determine the authenticity of your faith and to do that in a way that is revealed by what you do with your pocketbook.
[766.76 → 771.76] If you want to know what a man loves, look at his wallet.
[771.76 → 776.76] If you want to know what really matters to her, look at her bank book.
[776.76 → 785.76] Now I know that most of us under 40 don't even know what a bank book is and so maybe look at the apps on your phone or look at the app store history of purchase.
[785.76 → 786.76] Look at your Amazon order history.
[786.76 → 787.76] Right?
[787.76 → 791.76] Whatever you find in those places is what you will find a person loves.
[791.76 → 798.76] And that's because whatever you love is your, using James language, crown of life.
[798.76 → 807.76] Now James is picking up on an image that comes across in the New Testament because of the culture it's written in.
[807.76 → 808.76] Right?
[808.76 → 816.76] The Apostle Paul will use this image when he talks about persevering in faith, about running the race that was marked out for us, about competing in the games.
[816.76 → 817.76] Right?
[817.76 → 821.76] Competing in the trials about keeping obedient to the discipline of following God.
[821.76 → 822.76] Right?
[822.76 → 828.76] This crown of life is a phrase that's used in Revelation 2 where Jesus says to the church of Smyrna,
[828.76 → 835.76] Be faithful unto death and I will give you the crown of life.
[835.76 → 836.76] Right?
[836.76 → 841.76] And that image is not a crown of jewels or gold like you might suspect.
[841.76 → 843.76] It is actually a laurel wreath.
[843.76 → 844.76] Right?
[844.76 → 852.76] A wreath of leaves that would be wrapped together and wound together and given to athletes in the Greek games.
[852.76 → 864.76] Or similarly, the Romans had a tradition of an oaken laurel that would be given to soldiers and generals of Rome who have marked themselves out in battle with great accomplishment.
[864.76 → 871.76] It is the prize of your work.
[871.76 → 874.76] And so, what is the prize of your work?
[874.76 → 878.76] What is the reason you do everything and anything?
[878.76 → 885.76] What do you hope will happen or will come to you, or what do you hope to gain as a result of your efforts?
[885.76 → 886.76] Right?
[886.76 → 887.76] Everyone has a crown.
[887.76 → 888.76] Right?
[888.76 → 891.76] Or an idea of what your crown is.
[891.76 → 895.76] Everything you do and why you do it is for that crown.
[895.76 → 896.76] And not just one crown.
[896.76 → 897.76] Right?
[897.76 → 898.76] Let's be honest.
[898.76 → 902.76] We have a bunch of different crowns that compete for our attention and for our affections in life.
[902.76 → 905.76] And a bunch of reasons to do this thing or that thing.
[905.76 → 908.76] And sometimes those things are congruent and work together.
[908.76 → 910.76] And sometimes those things are at odds with each other.
[910.76 → 922.76] When I was in university, I really believed that doing well was important.
[922.76 → 923.76] Right?
[923.76 → 928.76] That doing well would help me get into a good grad school with good scholarships to support that work.
[928.76 → 935.76] And I believed that doing well would affect the job that I was able to have in the future.
[935.76 → 937.76] And so, I studied hard.
[937.76 → 938.76] I worked hard.
[938.76 → 941.76] I worked diligently on research papers.
[941.76 → 946.76] And I enrolled in the most difficult classes that my program could offer.
[946.76 → 951.76] And at exactly the same time, I really believed that people mattered.
[951.76 → 953.76] That my social life was important.
[953.76 → 957.76] And that I would miss something amazing if I didn't hang out with everyone.
[957.76 → 958.76] Right?
[958.76 → 960.76] I didn't want people to tell me cool stories.
[960.76 → 962.76] I wanted to be part of people's cool stories.
[962.76 → 965.76] And so, I would stay up too late.
[965.76 → 967.76] I would go out when I should have been studying.
[967.76 → 970.76] And I worried too much about what people thought.
[970.76 → 974.76] And I'd live in this constant state of worry about missing out.
[974.76 → 975.76] Right?
[975.76 → 978.76] Each one of those things crowns at odds with each other.
[978.76 → 984.76] And yet, they each directed aspects or the whole of my life in those moments.
[984.76 → 995.76] And so, what James is saying is that if you want to endure trials and tests of faith, your crown better be able to hold up under the weight you put on it.
[995.76 → 996.76] Right?
[996.76 → 1009.76] And if our crown is made up of the weight of God's glory, if our faith is really real, then the reward, the crown of life really is worth changing your life for.
[1009.76 → 1012.76] And just so we're super clear here.
[1012.76 → 1016.76] The crown of life is eternal blessedness with God.
[1016.76 → 1019.76] The crown of life is resurrection unto salvation.
[1019.76 → 1026.76] The crown of life is dwelling in the majestic beauty of Almighty God on an earth restored to His design and for His glory.
[1026.76 → 1035.76] The crown of life is spiritual riches granted for us in the heavenly realms which you have already received by grace through faith.
[1035.76 → 1043.76] The life you live with real faith as a hearer and doer of the word is the start.
[1043.76 → 1046.76] But the life you live is a foretaste.
[1046.76 → 1050.76] It is a preview of the life to come when Jesus returns.
[1050.76 → 1054.76] And the church in the world is a taste of the kingdom.
[1054.76 → 1058.76] At least when the church lives according to her calling.
[1058.76 → 1074.76] Your life at school, your life at work, your life at soccer or at the gym or in your neighbourhood, when you orient yourself towards the crown of life, is a taste of the kingdom of Jesus.
[1074.76 → 1077.76] People see it and wonder.
[1077.76 → 1086.76] And there ought to be a certain magnetism that compels people to move towards Jesus because of how you live.
[1086.76 → 1087.76] Right?
[1087.76 → 1094.76] In your life, to continue this metaphor, you are an evangelist for something, for some vision of the good life.
[1094.76 → 1095.76] Right?
[1095.76 → 1096.76] Everyone is.
[1096.76 → 1097.76] Everyone is an evangelist for something.
[1097.76 → 1101.76] You are what you love, and you want others to love like you.
[1101.76 → 1102.76] You.
[1102.76 → 1108.76] You will tell the gospel of Jesus by how you live, or you will tell the gospel of the western world.
[1108.76 → 1114.76] The story, the telling of some gospel, the telling of some story by your life is inescapable.
[1114.76 → 1120.76] What really matters for us to think about is whose gospel are you telling?
[1120.76 → 1137.76] And if you want to tell the gospel of Jesus, if you want to be, if you want that to be the story that your life tells, it starts for James and for us today with your view, wealth, and money.
[1137.76 → 1150.76] Believers in humble circumstances ought to take pride in their high position, but the rich should take pride in their humiliation since they will pass away like a wildflower.
[1150.76 → 1163.76] In the world of James, and perhaps still in our world today, it was said that the poor were ignored or punished by God, and so they deserved no special courtesy.
[1163.76 → 1168.76] In a world that said the wealthy were blessed by God and should then be shown favour.
[1168.76 → 1169.76] Right?
[1169.76 → 1176.76] In a world that said the wealthy were viewed as spiritually blessed and worthy of special treatment while the poor are considered spiritually poor and treated poorly.
[1176.76 → 1182.76] James is saying, not so for those of you whose faith is made real.
[1182.76 → 1183.76] Right?
[1183.76 → 1187.76] There is a levelling that takes place in the church.
[1187.76 → 1188.76] Right?
[1188.76 → 1194.76] Those in poverty and in humility are raised up and those of wealth and status are brought low.
[1194.76 → 1201.76] Money isn't the determiner of status, but spirituality and Holy Spirit giftedness.
[1201.76 → 1203.76] The New Testament works this out.
[1203.76 → 1208.76] That Paul's letter that he writes to Philemon about Onesies.
[1208.76 → 1214.76] Onesies is a former slave of Philemon, and he's run away, and he's joined up with Paul.
[1214.76 → 1215.76] Right?
[1215.76 → 1229.76] And Paul writes this letter on behalf of Onesies to Philemon, and he says that Philemon, that Onesies will come back to Philemon no longer as a slave, but better than a slave as a dear brother.
[1229.76 → 1235.76] Paul says, he is very dear to me, but even dear to you both as a man and as a brother.
[1235.76 → 1239.76] So think what Paul has done there.
[1239.76 → 1242.76] He's taken a slave and given him his humanity back.
[1242.76 → 1247.76] He's very dear to me, but even dear to you both as a man.
[1247.76 → 1253.76] And he's taken a slave, given him his humanity back and given him a family as a brother.
[1253.76 → 1256.76] Brother in Christ Jesus.
[1256.76 → 1259.76] A slave is raised up to a brother.
[1259.76 → 1264.76] There's another story that comes out of the second century early church.
[1264.76 → 1267.76] Christian leader by the name of Herman.
[1267.76 → 1272.76] He is known in history for writing a document called The Shepherd of Herman.
[1272.76 → 1281.76] This is a collection of writings and a vision that he had received in that at the time of his writing and for a hundred years or so afterwards,
[1281.76 → 1288.76] the earliest church fathers actually considered the Shepherd of Herman, Herman' writing to be canonical, part of the Bible.
[1288.76 → 1290.76] They later discerned that that wasn't the case.
[1290.76 → 1295.76] But point is here that Herman was born as a slave.
[1295.76 → 1310.76] Actually Herman was, the story goes, was one who was left as an infant be abandoned in the Roman practice of leaving unwanted children outside in a garbage heap.
[1310.76 → 1315.76] And someone came and collected him and raised him as a slave.
[1315.76 → 1327.76] And eventually this person Herman becomes a Christian, and he writes what many consider to be authoritative words, and he becomes a leader in the early church.
[1327.76 → 1335.76] A slave becomes a leader, poor become rich, and the rich become as with the poor.
[1335.76 → 1340.76] And only the gospel of Jesus does that.
[1340.76 → 1348.76] Right? That's because only the gospel of Jesus levels the playing field before and after regeneration.
[1348.76 → 1353.76] Right? The gospel says that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[1353.76 → 1358.76] The gospel says that there is no one who is righteous, not even one.
[1358.76 → 1368.76] The gospel says that no matter who you are or how successful in life you are, no matter what kind of status or power you have, whether you are prince or pauper,
[1368.76 → 1373.76] there is nothing that you can do to earn God's favour and salvation.
[1373.76 → 1379.76] That the wages of sin is death for everyone who sins and everyone sins.
[1379.76 → 1384.76] Right? We are all equal in our depravity and in our inability.
[1384.76 → 1389.76] We all need a saviour. We all need Jesus.
[1389.76 → 1393.76] And to us all, he comes.
[1393.76 → 1401.76] And to those who are unable and unworthy, to those who are unwilling and righteous, to the dead, he comes to bring life.
[1401.76 → 1402.76] And into this world he comes.
[1402.76 → 1407.76] And though this world did not recognize the voice of the one who created it,
[1407.76 → 1413.76] Jesus comes, and he lives the life I should have lived, satisfying God's righteous requirements for obedience.
[1413.76 → 1424.76] And Jesus dies the death that I deserve, satisfying God's righteous demands for justice as a consequence of sin.
[1424.76 → 1432.76] And the same Jesus rises three days later, winning victory over sin and death.
[1432.76 → 1436.76] And now death has lost its sting and sin has been defeated.
[1436.76 → 1443.76] And by the spirit you are raised into new life, into this life, the life of Jesus.
[1443.76 → 1446.76] A life that is not ruled by sin, but ruled by Jesus.
[1446.76 → 1453.76] A life captivated by the beauty of his voice who spoke at creation, who like he did to Lazarus,
[1453.76 → 1458.76] Jesus calls you out of the grave by grace and invites you to live out of that same grace.
[1458.76 → 1464.76] Now, a life lived in a new kind of community that we call the church,
[1464.76 → 1470.76] where all are equal in her eyes and worthy of dignity and respect.
[1470.76 → 1474.76] You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
[1474.76 → 1479.76] For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
[1479.76 → 1490.76] There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ.
[1490.76 → 1500.76] The crown of life that Jesus gives is worth more than all the gold or silver, wealth or status that the world can give you.
[1500.76 → 1506.76] A life that lives out that is faith made real.
[1506.76 → 1509.76] That's what it means to be hearers and doers.
[1509.76 → 1515.76] In fact, very quickly, James writing here says,
[1515.76 → 1536.76] James is doing this really beautiful contrast here that's saying that material wealth, material status, material possession,
[1536.76 → 1540.76] they are the things that are illusory, they are the things that will fall away.
[1540.76 → 1545.76] What is really real is your identity in Jesus Christ.
[1545.76 → 1550.76] What is really real is who Jesus is.
[1552.76 → 1560.76] So, let me finish here with a thought or two about how to do this.
[1560.76 → 1563.76] These are just examples, right?
[1563.76 → 1569.76] In part, it is your job to listen and then figure out how to apply this to your specific and unique circumstances.
[1569.76 → 1576.76] And so, I'll give you a couple examples, but then your work to do the hard work of applying it.
[1576.76 → 1579.76] We've heard, now let's do.
[1579.76 → 1581.76] What does doing look like?
[1581.76 → 1584.76] So, maybe you run a business.
[1584.76 → 1591.76] Maybe you've got big clients who spend a ton of money at your business, and you've got small clients who only spend a small fraction of that.
[1591.76 → 1596.76] May it be that they both walk away from a meeting with you feeling like they matter.
[1596.76 → 1603.76] Maybe the small client gets the exact same attention and quality of service as the biggest one does.
[1603.76 → 1612.76] And maybe the big client gets to see that you really care about your customers and really want to serve everyone, no matter who they are or where they come from.
[1612.76 → 1617.76] Maybe that's the story you get to tell when you make your faith real.
[1617.76 → 1626.76] Maybe you have a chance to have lunch with the real movers and shakers of our community, right?
[1626.76 → 1630.76] The people to whom the leaders look for leadership.
[1630.76 → 1639.76] And just as you are about to leave to go to have that meeting, someone shows up at your door, someone who you don't know but has come to you for help.
[1639.76 → 1646.76] Maybe that that person gets your attention and love at that moment because, one, they are right in front of you.
[1646.76 → 1658.76] But two, even if they do nothing to advance their standing, to advance your standing, they are worth seeing Jesus in you and from you.
[1658.76 → 1662.76] Maybe there's a disagreement on your team, right?
[1662.76 → 1667.76] And the person on your team or on your board or in your community, right?
[1667.76 → 1674.76] The person with power and money who has bankrolled everything you have done for years threatens to pull out and to take all their money with them.
[1674.76 → 1678.76] You've got to decide what really matters.
[1678.76 → 1693.76] You've got to decide, is placating this person, is keeping the peace with this person more important than what you guys have together prayerfully discerned is the vision of God for your work?
[1693.76 → 1694.76] Try this.
[1694.76 → 1699.76] Look at your yearly household budget.
[1699.76 → 1701.76] Where do you spend your money?
[1701.76 → 1703.76] But your budget tells a story.
[1703.76 → 1705.76] Our church budget tells a story.
[1705.76 → 1708.76] Your budget is your statement of priorities.
[1708.76 → 1721.76] And so, in your budget, whether at church or at home, do you support ministry and mission as much or more or less than vacation?
[1721.76 → 1722.76] Right?
[1722.76 → 1729.76] If someone could see how you spend your money, what would they say you really love?
[1729.76 → 1730.76] And let me be abundantly clear.
[1730.76 → 1737.76] This applies to those of us with lots of money and this applies to those of us with no money.
[1737.76 → 1742.76] Maybe you're a teenager, and you think, well, I don't have any money.
[1742.76 → 1743.76] Right?
[1743.76 → 1744.76] What am I going to do?
[1744.76 → 1745.76] How do I show this?
[1745.76 → 1755.76] And yet still, you've bought that whatever DLC content for Fortnite that came out recently because that's what mattered.
[1755.76 → 1756.76] Right?
[1756.76 → 1763.76] You're saving to buy the PS5 because that's what matters when they finally become available on the market again.
[1763.76 → 1774.76] No matter what station or status you have in life, what you do with wealth and money will be determined by what you think the crown of life is.
[1774.76 → 1776.76] Your life tells a story.
[1776.76 → 1777.76] Your life tells a story.
[1777.76 → 1778.76] Your life tells a story.
[1778.76 → 1781.76] That's what it means to be hearers and doers.
[1781.76 → 1789.76] For your life to tell the story of Jesus redeeming and restoring.
[1789.76 → 1796.76] What you do with your money to tell his story.
[1796.76 → 1808.76] And when it does, if it does, even if nothing about our story changes.
[1808.76 → 1811.76] And by that I mean even if we don't get more material blessing.
[1811.76 → 1813.76] Even if we don't get that PS5.
[1813.76 → 1816.76] Even if we can't download that new content.
[1816.76 → 1817.76] Whatever the case may be.
[1817.76 → 1819.76] Even if we don't get that vacation.
[1819.76 → 1827.76] How we live at that moment tells a true better story.
[1827.76 → 1831.76] All those other things are illusory.
[1831.76 → 1832.76] The one that matters.
[1832.76 → 1834.76] The one that matters.
[1834.76 → 1835.76] Jesus.
[1835.76 → 1840.76] May he be your crown of life.
[1840.76 → 1844.76] May the life you live reflect his glory.
[1844.76 → 1852.76] Then, like James began, you might know pure joy.
[1852.76 → 1855.76] Let me pray for you.
[1855.76 → 1864.76] Lord God.
[1864.76 → 1871.76] Would you take this truth and convict us?
[1871.76 → 1884.76] Open our eyes to those places and those people and those circumstances where we have made wealth and power and riches more important than we have made you.
[1884.76 → 1888.76] Your gospel and your story.
[1888.76 → 1902.76] Open our eyes to those places where competing crowns have overwhelmed your position in our hearts on the throne of our lives.
[1902.76 → 1907.76] And as our eyes are opened to your truth this morning.
[1907.76 → 1909.76] Instead of shame.
[1909.76 → 1912.76] May we have conviction.
[1912.76 → 1916.76] Instead of guilt.
[1916.76 → 1919.76] Where we run from you.
[1919.76 → 1923.76] May we experience grace where we are drawn to you.
[1923.76 → 1930.76] And so open our eyes to our need for confession.
[1930.76 → 1935.76] That we might experience your mercy today.
[1935.76 → 1942.76] So forgive us for those times when we have made wealth and status more important.
[1942.76 → 1948.76] Forgive us for those times when we have pursued after other things not of you.
[1948.76 → 1953.76] For those times when they have distracted us from you.
[1953.76 → 1955.76] Raise us up.
[1955.76 → 1957.76] Newness of life.
[1957.76 → 1960.76] That we might live for the glory of your name.
[1960.76 → 1963.76] In Jesus Christ we pray.
[1963.76 → 1966.76] Relying on his Holy Spirit.
[1966.76 → 1968.76] Live in this way.
[1968.76 → 1969.76] We say together.
[1969.76 → 1970.76] Amen.
[1970.76 → 1989.76] S intake A
