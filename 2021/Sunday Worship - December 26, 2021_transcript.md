[1713.80 --> 1717.80]  Born to a people in fulfillment of their expectations

[1755.80 --> 1760.80]  As you speak the truth of the gospel over every aspect of our life together
[1763.80 --> 1766.80]  Father God we give you praise for those of us who had chances
[1767.80 --> 1769.80]  In this past week or yet again today

[1813.80 --> 1817.80]  Those of us this time of year who are thinking about those people whom
[1818.80 --> 1820.80]  We have lost along this journey of life
[1820.80 --> 1833.80]  We pray Lord God that you would be near to those of us who are wondering in anxiety and hurt and pain
[1834.80 --> 1839.80]  Father God we know that this has been a
[1839.80 --> 1845.80]  A different and unexpected or unfortunate
[1846.80 --> 1848.80]  Christmas holiday season
[1849.80 --> 1855.80]  With all sorts of different things that have impacted our ability to gather in the ways that we would like
[1856.80 --> 1861.80]  Particularly we know that covid cases are rising seemingly exponentially
[1862.80 --> 1864.80]  That we're in this midst of the fifth wave
[1864.80 --> 1869.80]  And in this all God we know that there is so much frustration
[1870.80 --> 1871.80]  So much covid fatigue
[1875.80 --> 1876.80]  We're just done
[1879.80 --> 1880.80]  Just
[1881.80 --> 1882.80]  Ready to ignore it all
[1883.80 --> 1885.80]  And yet Lord God
[1886.80 --> 1887.80]  More is required of us
[1888.80 --> 1889.80]  More is being asked of us
[1889.80 --> 1893.80]  Not only by public health officials and those in authority
[1894.80 --> 1898.80]  But by you and by your grace and by your call to love our neighbor
[1899.80 --> 1902.80]  Even when it is hard Lord God
[1903.80 --> 1905.80]  We are called to be that light on a hill
[1906.80 --> 1907.80]  We are called to be the light of the world
[1908.80 --> 1911.80]  And so stir in us a renewed empathy
[1912.80 --> 1913.80]  Stir in us a renewed compassion
[1913.80 --> 1916.80]  Stir in us a new vigor
[1917.80 --> 1920.80]  To proclaim your gospel fruit
[1921.80 --> 1926.80]  May your perfect love drive out our fear
[1927.80 --> 1931.80]  May we not be ruled by fear
[1932.80 --> 1936.80]  God whether we are on one side of this issue or another
[1936.80 --> 1939.80]  It is so easy to let fear determine our responses
[1940.80 --> 1942.80]  Fear of governmental overreach
[1943.80 --> 1944.80]  Fear of disease
[1945.80 --> 1948.80]  Fear of the rights being taken away
[1949.80 --> 1952.80]  And fear of the right to health and safety being overcome
[1953.80 --> 1957.80]  May we not be spurred by fear
[1958.80 --> 1961.80]  But may we be moved in love
[1961.80 --> 1967.80]  God we know that there are members in our church family
[1968.80 --> 1969.80]  Who right now have COVID
[1970.80 --> 1971.80]  We pray for them
[1972.80 --> 1973.80]  We pray for healing
[1974.80 --> 1978.80]  We pray for your presence and your nearness on these days of isolating and recovery
[1979.80 --> 1985.80]  We pray Lord God for those of us who have family members and friends who are dealing with COVID
[1986.80 --> 1990.80]  Or for the COVID long haulers and those of us who have lost loved ones
[1991.80 --> 1992.80]  Because of COVID
[1993.80 --> 2001.80]  In the midst of this all Lord God we need new experience of your love, your presence, your power and your peace
[2002.80 --> 2003.80]  And so give us that
[2004.80 --> 2012.80]  Father we want to pray for those nurses and doctors and clerks and other healthcare staff
[2013.80 --> 2017.80]  Who are in the midst of this more than so many of us
[2017.80 --> 2020.80]  We pray for burnout and for frustration and anger
[2021.80 --> 2025.80]  We pray Lord God that you would sustain all those in need
[2026.80 --> 2034.80]  We pray that for those whom we know we might support them not only in prayer here but by our words of encouragement and love
[2034.80 --> 2035.80]  God these days
[2035.80 --> 2047.80]  Heavenly Father in the midst of this season we are so grateful for the ongoing opportunity to gather as a church community
[2048.80 --> 2051.80]  So grateful for the ongoing ministries of your church
[2051.80 --> 2061.80]  God I want to pray for the incredible number of volunteers and leaders and the people who make ministry here and from here to the world possible
[2062.80 --> 2070.80]  So thank you for the incredible devotion and acts of service of so many people in this church family
[2070.80 --> 2080.80]  God we pray as well for our budget and for the ministries that we accomplish by that giving
[2081.80 --> 2086.80]  Pray Lord God that you would continue to encourage us in that as we end this year
[2087.80 --> 2093.80]  May we do so full of hope and conviction that you are leading us in your mission
[2093.80 --> 2104.80]  God we know there are so many things that are happening here that require extra from us that require more time or talent or treasure
[2105.80 --> 2114.80]  And we pray that we would do that with open hearts and acts of service expression of our love and worship
[2114.80 --> 2124.80]  Father God we know as well that there are those in our midst who are dealing with health concerns
[2125.80 --> 2131.80]  Those people who are receiving treatments or procedures or surgeries major or minor
[2132.80 --> 2137.80]  We pray for your presence for all people who are waiting for the same or who are recovering from the same
[2137.80 --> 2140.80]  We pray that you would be near to them
[2141.80 --> 2145.80]  Pray for Miriam and for her recovery from the detached retina
[2146.80 --> 2154.80]  Asking God that you would be near to her and restore her through the process of treatment that she is undergoing
[2155.80 --> 2160.80]  We pray for Elsa after her fall and her subsequent surgery and the recovery that she has
[2160.80 --> 2163.80]  As grateful to have seen her here in worship
[2164.80 --> 2165.80]  A few days ago
[2166.80 --> 2171.80]  We pray that you would be near to her and her recovery and give her the patience that she needs as well to do that well
[2172.80 --> 2175.80]  We pray Lord God for the
[2176.80 --> 2182.80]  The many others whom we have held up and who are in ongoing treatment processes
[2183.80 --> 2186.80]  Asking that you would work in their lives
[2186.80 --> 2189.80]  God with Frank and Sylvia
[2190.80 --> 2193.80]  We want to pray for their niece and nephew and their five families Darren
[2194.80 --> 2195.80]  Krista
[2196.80 --> 2197.80]  Their five kids as they
[2198.80 --> 2201.80]  Are dealing with the effects of a fire in their house and are now looking for a
[2202.80 --> 2204.80]  Five bedroom place pray that you would provide for them
[2205.80 --> 2208.80]  Through their church community or through our church community
[2209.80 --> 2213.80]  Pray Lord God that you would watch over them and give them what they need
[2213.80 --> 2216.80]  Thank you for the way that they have been surrounded in love and care and prayer and
[2216.80 --> 2221.80]  Ask God that you would work in the midst of that time
[2222.80 --> 2223.80]  And their circumstance
[2224.80 --> 2228.80]  Father God we pray now as we come to your word that
[2229.80 --> 2237.80]  In the hearing of your word we would hear the voice of Jesus that that you would convict our hearts and that you would
[2237.80 --> 2244.80]  Restore us to the joy of your salvation restore us to the hope of your kingdom come and your kingdom coming
[2245.80 --> 2248.80]  Restore us by the words of the good shepherd
[2249.80 --> 2251.80]  May we be sheep who know his
[2251.80 --> 2253.80]  His
[2254.80 --> 2255.80]  Pray for Josh as he
[2256.80 --> 2258.80]  Brings your word opens it up and explains it to us
[2259.80 --> 2261.80]  Give him what he needs and thank you for the preparations that
[2262.80 --> 2266.80]  He has done in the call that you have placed on his life and the opportunity that we have
[2267.80 --> 2270.80]  To be used of you to develop that
[2271.80 --> 2273.80]  So Lord God we pray
[2273.80 --> 2277.80]  Trusting that you are at work in the world by the prayers of your saints
[2278.80 --> 2279.80]  Hear our prayers
[2280.80 --> 2282.80]  In the name of Jesus Christ we pray
[2283.80 --> 2284.80]  Amen
[2303.80 --> 2308.80]  Hello
[2309.80 --> 2310.80]  Beautiful
[2311.80 --> 2312.80]  Okay, this is all working out
[2315.80 --> 2316.80]  Okay
[2317.80 --> 2318.80]  Today we're going to open our Bibles to Luke 2
[2319.80 --> 2320.80]  41 to 52
[2321.80 --> 2322.80]  So behind me?
[2323.80 --> 2324.80]  Yeah
[2325.80 --> 2329.80]  Following the Advent series where Chris and Kevin un-hallmarked the memorable stories of Jesus' birth
[2329.80 --> 2331.80]  We get a story when he was a child
[2332.80 --> 2334.80]  It's the only story when he wasn't an infant or 30
[2335.80 --> 2336.80]  He's 12 in this story
[2337.80 --> 2338.80]  And he does something that's
[2339.80 --> 2340.80]  odd
[2341.80 --> 2342.80]  Reading it
[2342.80 --> 2343.80]  Seems a bit weird
[2344.80 --> 2345.80]  So let's get into it
[2346.80 --> 2347.80]  If your Bibles are open
[2348.80 --> 2349.80]  Awesome
[2350.80 --> 2351.80]  If not, it'll be on the screen
[2352.80 --> 2353.80]  Okay
[2354.80 --> 2358.80]  Every year Jesus' parents went to Jerusalem for the festival of the Passover
[2358.80 --> 2359.80]  When he was 12 years old
[2359.80 --> 2361.80]  They went up to the festival according to the custom
[2362.80 --> 2363.80]  After the festival was over
[2364.80 --> 2365.80]  With his parents
[2366.80 --> 2367.80]  While his parents were returning home
[2368.80 --> 2369.80]  The boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem
[2370.80 --> 2371.80]  But they were unaware of it
[2372.80 --> 2374.80]  Thinking he was in their company they traveled on for a day
[2375.80 --> 2377.80]  Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends
[2378.80 --> 2381.80]  When they did not find him they went back to Jerusalem to look for him
[2382.80 --> 2384.80]  After three days they found him in the temple courts
[2384.80 --> 2386.80]  Sitting among the teachers
[2387.80 --> 2389.80]  Listening to them and asking them questions
[2390.80 --> 2393.80]  Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers
[2394.80 --> 2396.80]  When his parents saw him they were astonished
[2397.80 --> 2398.80]  His mother said to him
[2398.80 --> 2399.80]  Son, why have you treated us like this?
[2400.80 --> 2402.80]  Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you
[2403.80 --> 2405.80]  Why were you searching for me?
[2406.80 --> 2407.80]  He asked
[2408.80 --> 2410.80]  Didn't you know I had to be in my father's house?
[2410.80 --> 2413.80]  But they did not understand what he was saying to them
[2414.80 --> 2416.80]  Then he went down to Nazareth with them
[2417.80 --> 2418.80]  And was obedient to them
[2419.80 --> 2420.80]  But his mother treasured all these things in her heart
[2421.80 --> 2422.80]  And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature
[2423.80 --> 2424.80]  And in favor with God and men
[2425.80 --> 2429.80]  That's a weird story, right?
[2430.80 --> 2434.80]  Jesus the Messiah leaves his parents without telling them
[2435.80 --> 2436.80]  And they're searching through the whole city to find him
[2436.80 --> 2439.80]  Every parent's worst nightmare
[2440.80 --> 2443.80]  This seems like the one story you wouldn't want to put in the Bible
[2444.80 --> 2445.80]  About the Messiah
[2446.80 --> 2447.80]  Yet here it is
[2449.80 --> 2451.80]  It's also weird because we're just out of the season of Advent
[2452.80 --> 2454.80]  The season where the expectation of the Messiah to come
[2455.80 --> 2457.80]  That would free us from all our sins
[2458.80 --> 2460.80]  Then we celebrate Christmas yesterday
[2460.80 --> 2465.80]  His birth has been expected and prophesied since the fall of Eden
[2466.80 --> 2468.80]  Whole nations have waited for this Messiah
[2469.80 --> 2471.80]  Three visits from an angel to his family told of his birth
[2472.80 --> 2475.80]  Followed by a host of angels blessing the world from on high
[2476.80 --> 2480.80]  Stars aligned to guide Magi from the east to visit him as an infant
[2481.80 --> 2485.80]  His country's king ordered the death of all the kids in the town he happened to be born in
[2485.80 --> 2488.80]  Another angel had to warn his family to protect him
[2489.80 --> 2492.80]  Prophets Anna and Simeon met him and wept because they realized
[2493.80 --> 2496.80]  They finally were in the presence of the one who was their salvation
[2497.80 --> 2498.80]  And then
[2499.80 --> 2500.80]  12 years of nothing
[2501.80 --> 2504.80]  And then we get this story when he's 12 and he runs away
[2505.80 --> 2508.80]  And then 18 years of more nothing
[2509.80 --> 2513.80]  As if that whole grand entrance never happened
[2513.80 --> 2518.80]  He was supposed to arrive and then save the world
[2519.80 --> 2523.80]  Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests
[2524.80 --> 2527.80]  A host of angels sang his entrance into the world
[2528.80 --> 2529.80]  What is he doing?
[2530.80 --> 2531.80]  Where is the glory to God?
[2532.80 --> 2533.80]  Where is the peace?
[2534.80 --> 2535.80]  What could he be doing?
[2536.80 --> 2537.80]  Well
[2538.80 --> 2539.80]  He's living
[2540.80 --> 2541.80]  Growing
[2541.80 --> 2542.80]  Growing
[2542.80 --> 2543.80]  Learning
[2544.80 --> 2545.80]  Going to family dinners
[2546.80 --> 2547.80]  Visiting his cousins
[2548.80 --> 2550.80]  Working a 9 to 5 in carpentry with Joseph
[2551.80 --> 2552.80]  Taking lunch breaks
[2553.80 --> 2556.80]  Fixing that door that squeaks because the bracket is broken again
[2557.80 --> 2560.80]  Helping his friends with something bad it's happening
[2561.80 --> 2562.80]  Going to the synagogue
[2562.80 --> 2566.80]  Why doesn't the Bible give us any of this?
[2567.80 --> 2568.80]  What he was like
[2569.80 --> 2570.80]  What he did with his life
[2571.80 --> 2574.80]  It doesn't give us this time of his life because it was normal
[2575.80 --> 2576.80]  Mundane
[2577.80 --> 2578.80]  Average
[2579.80 --> 2583.80]  In this period of time in Jesus is living out a normal human life
[2583.80 --> 2585.80]  With all its mess love pain and sadness
[2586.80 --> 2592.80]  In this period of time Jesus is living out that perfectly obedient life as the perfectly obedient son
[2593.80 --> 2599.80]  He's facing all our problems and pains doing all our normal human things
[2600.80 --> 2604.80]  So that one day he can bring all those things that make us human to the cross
[2604.80 --> 2610.80]  The author of Hebrews clarifies this idea
[2611.80 --> 2614.80]  For this reason he had to be like them
[2615.80 --> 2619.80]  Fully human in every way in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest
[2620.80 --> 2621.80]  In service to God
[2622.80 --> 2623.80]  And that he might make atonement for the sins of the people
[2624.80 --> 2626.80]  Because he himself suffered when he was tempted
[2627.80 --> 2629.80]  He is able to help those who are being tempted
[2629.80 --> 2634.80]  So Jesus is doing normal human things
[2635.80 --> 2640.80]  Which means we find Jesus in this story doing a normal Jewish thing
[2641.80 --> 2644.80]  Actually the most normal Jewish thing
[2645.80 --> 2647.80]  He's traveling to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover
[2648.80 --> 2650.80]  And as every good Jewish family does
[2651.80 --> 2653.80]  They travel with their family and friends from the town and the surrounding area
[2654.80 --> 2656.80]  And they go on a pilgrimage to celebrate at the city of God
[2656.80 --> 2659.80]  The city where God dwelled in the midst of his people
[2660.80 --> 2661.80]  The city where his ark was held
[2662.80 --> 2663.80]  Where the sacrifices were made
[2664.80 --> 2667.80]  So Jesus and his family partake in the Passover
[2668.80 --> 2671.80]  The Passover and the travel would have taken over about a week
[2672.80 --> 2674.80]  Then they would have gone home
[2675.80 --> 2676.80]  The family and their friends would have packed up
[2677.80 --> 2678.80]  And walked the journey home to Nazareth
[2679.80 --> 2682.80]  But why tell us the story when he's 12?
[2682.80 --> 2685.80]  Why not tell us about the time they went to the Passover when he was 10?
[2686.80 --> 2687.80]  Or 16? Or 18?
[2688.80 --> 2689.80]  Why 12?
[2690.80 --> 2693.80]  Well, one reason could be that he decided to disappear for 3 days
[2694.80 --> 2699.80]  But the more likely reason is because the age itself
[2700.80 --> 2701.80]  12
[2702.80 --> 2703.80]  It's big in Jewish culture
[2704.80 --> 2706.80]  Modern Jews at the age of 13 will celebrate their bar mitzvah
[2707.80 --> 2708.80]  Bar mitzvah means son of the commandment
[2708.80 --> 2713.80]  This was the time when the males would be responsible fully under the Jewish law
[2714.80 --> 2720.80]  This became a standard practice back in the 14th century as it is named
[2721.80 --> 2726.80]  But all the way back before Jesus the age of 13 was that same transitional period
[2727.80 --> 2731.80]  All this to say that this is an important time in every Jewish kid's life
[2731.80 --> 2736.80]  The weight of responsibility and the expectations from their families was huge
[2737.80 --> 2740.80]  This was the period where you would either become a student of the law
[2741.80 --> 2742.80]  Or follow in your father's footsteps
[2743.80 --> 2746.80]  Sons would then take their father's occupation and take over the family's business
[2747.80 --> 2750.80]  So not only was this a big time for kids
[2751.80 --> 2753.80]  This was a big time for fathers
[2753.80 --> 2755.80]  The fathers had to prepare them to succeed
[2756.80 --> 2759.80]  Make sure they were studying the law to the best of their ability
[2760.80 --> 2761.80]  Or to teach them how to do the family job well
[2762.80 --> 2766.80]  So when Mary, Joseph, and Jesus go to Jerusalem
[2767.80 --> 2769.80]  This is a good chance for Joseph to prepare Jesus
[2770.80 --> 2772.80]  To take on the religious duties that adults have to go through
[2773.80 --> 2774.80]  Specifically with the Passover
[2774.80 --> 2777.80]  But also with the other areas like the sacrificial system
[2778.80 --> 2780.80]  And more in-depth religious duties
[2781.80 --> 2784.80]  This is a good chance for Joseph to shape Jesus' identity
[2787.80 --> 2789.80]  Now this transitional period that Jesus goes through
[2790.80 --> 2792.80]  Is not too dissimilar to what we go through today
[2793.80 --> 2795.80]  We don't have this transition when we turn 13
[2796.80 --> 2799.80]  But we have a transition moment like this when we turn 18 here in Canada
[2800.80 --> 2802.80]  At 18 we graduate high school
[2802.80 --> 2804.80]  We decide if we're going to go through university or trade school
[2805.80 --> 2807.80]  Or enter the workforce or wherever life leads you
[2815.80 --> 2816.80]  This is the moment when the responsibility is placed on our shoulders
[2817.80 --> 2819.80]  When all the preparation we had in school takes effect
[2820.80 --> 2824.80]  And like Jesus we had our parents, our guardians, our mentors, our teachers
[2825.80 --> 2826.80]  They're preparing us for that time in our life
[2827.80 --> 2828.80]  They taught us how to drive
[2829.80 --> 2830.80]  They might have taken us to the bank
[2830.80 --> 2831.80]  And stepped us through creating an account
[2832.80 --> 2833.80]  They taught us how to ride a bike
[2834.80 --> 2836.80]  When they cooked they might have got us to help them cook
[2837.80 --> 2839.80]  And then maybe they got us to cook on Thursdays or something like that
[2840.80 --> 2842.80]  When they fixed the car the parents might have got us to help
[2843.80 --> 2844.80]  To help them replace a light bulb
[2845.80 --> 2848.80]  But this isn't the only transition moment we face
[2849.80 --> 2850.80]  We go through others like this
[2851.80 --> 2853.80]  We get married, we have kids, we move between jobs
[2853.80 --> 2856.80]  We move between jobs or to a new city, a new country, a new continent
[2857.80 --> 2858.80]  We move out
[2859.80 --> 2860.80]  I did that recently
[2862.80 --> 2864.80]  We go through these transition periods
[2865.80 --> 2866.80]  Retirement is another one
[2867.80 --> 2869.80]  We all face major transition moments in our life
[2870.80 --> 2875.80]  These moments are filled with confusion and pressure, excitement and dread
[2875.80 --> 2877.80]  Jesus went through similar transitions
[2878.80 --> 2880.80]  He had those feelings, he had those pressures
[2881.80 --> 2883.80]  As Hebrews says, because he himself suffered
[2884.80 --> 2888.80]  And so now like every good Jewish family does
[2889.80 --> 2890.80]  After Passover is done
[2891.80 --> 2892.80]  They head back
[2892.80 --> 2893.80]  And everyone is walking together to Nazareth
[2894.80 --> 2895.80]  All the kids are probably running around in a group
[2896.80 --> 2897.80]  Playing with each other
[2898.80 --> 2899.80]  People are talking about the great time they had
[2900.80 --> 2901.80]  Sharing stories
[2901.80 --> 2903.80]  Mary and Joseph among these people
[2904.80 --> 2905.80]  Probably saw Jesus go off with some others
[2906.80 --> 2908.80]  And they thought he was safe because he was with family
[2909.80 --> 2911.80]  He might be playing with the other kids and cousins
[2912.80 --> 2913.80]  Later that day when they go rest
[2914.80 --> 2915.80]  They check out where he is
[2916.80 --> 2917.80]  But they can't find him
[2918.80 --> 2920.80]  So they go ask Grandpa Helly if he's seen him
[2921.80 --> 2922.80]  He's not there, maybe he's with the other kids
[2923.80 --> 2924.80]  Oh no
[2925.80 --> 2930.80]  They see Jesus wasn't there when it got dark
[2931.80 --> 2934.80]  They search the camp asking around for the family and their friends
[2934.80 --> 2935.80]  If they seen Jesus
[2936.80 --> 2937.80]  It's normal he might be around
[2937.80 --> 2938.80]  There are a lot of people around
[2939.80 --> 2940.80]  But they still can't find him
[2941.80 --> 2942.80]  So they race back to Jerusalem
[2943.80 --> 2944.80]  They visit all the places they went to
[2945.80 --> 2946.80]  They ask around
[2947.80 --> 2949.80]  And then they finally arrive at the main location where the Passover took place
[2950.80 --> 2951.80]  The temple
[2952.80 --> 2953.80]  And they find him there
[2954.80 --> 2956.80]  They see him sitting with the teachers of the law
[2957.80 --> 2958.80]  Listening intently
[2959.80 --> 2960.80]  Asking questions
[2960.80 --> 2961.80]  And when Mary and Joseph get there
[2961.80 --> 2963.80]  Mary does what every good mother would do
[2963.80 --> 2964.80]  In this situation
[2964.80 --> 2966.80]  She interrupts the highest level of authority in the land
[2967.80 --> 2968.80]  And scolds her son in front of them for running away
[2969.80 --> 2973.80]  Son, why have you treated us like this?
[2974.80 --> 2977.80]  Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you
[2978.80 --> 2979.80]  She's been worried for a long time
[2980.80 --> 2982.80]  That kind of fear that only parents can feel
[2983.80 --> 2985.80]  And more than that, after all that happened at his birth
[2985.80 --> 2988.80]  The advent, the angels, all the kids at Bethlehem that got killed
[2989.80 --> 2991.80]  The wise men, God telling her her son would be the Messiah
[2992.80 --> 2993.80]  Luke writes
[2994.80 --> 2995.80]  When his parents saw him
[2996.80 --> 2997.80]  They were astonished
[2998.80 --> 3000.80]  Somehow I feel like with all this in mind
[3001.80 --> 3002.80]  That was a huge understatement
[3003.80 --> 3005.80]  And in response Jesus says this
[3006.80 --> 3008.80]  Why were you searching for me?
[3008.80 --> 3011.80]  Didn't you know I was supposed to be here?
[3012.80 --> 3013.80]  What?
[3014.80 --> 3017.80]  What kind of response is that?
[3018.80 --> 3021.80]  Let's look at the text
[3022.80 --> 3024.80]  Where did they find Jesus when they found him?
[3025.80 --> 3027.80]  At the temple
[3028.80 --> 3029.80]  Okay, okay
[3030.80 --> 3031.80]  Where does he go?
[3031.80 --> 3032.80]  Where does he go?
[3032.80 --> 3033.80]  What is he doing there?
[3035.80 --> 3036.80]  Learning
[3036.80 --> 3037.80]  Listening
[3038.80 --> 3039.80]  Asking questions
[3040.80 --> 3041.80]  Yes
[3042.80 --> 3043.80]  He's at the most important location in Jewish thought
[3044.80 --> 3046.80]  And listening to the most important people
[3047.80 --> 3048.80]  Talk about the Jewish religion
[3049.80 --> 3050.80]  He's paying attention to what the leaders of the religion are saying
[3051.80 --> 3052.80]  The experts
[3053.80 --> 3054.80]  The religion about him by the way
[3055.80 --> 3057.80]  Which, when you think about it
[3058.80 --> 3060.80]  That makes this the best episode of Undercover Boss
[3061.80 --> 3062.80]  He's listening
[3065.80 --> 3066.80]  Learning
[3067.80 --> 3068.80]  And understanding
[3069.80 --> 3070.80]  He's not speaking to them in authority
[3071.80 --> 3072.80]  He's not commanding them
[3073.80 --> 3074.80]  Speaking with great rhetoric or prose
[3075.80 --> 3076.80]  He's a student
[3077.80 --> 3078.80]  Not a rabbi
[3079.80 --> 3080.80]  Jesus is preparing
[3081.80 --> 3082.80]  In the temple
[3083.80 --> 3084.80]  In his father's house
[3086.80 --> 3088.80]  Jesus is not just going through a transition
[3089.80 --> 3090.80]  Into life as an adult
[3091.80 --> 3092.80]  He's going through a transition
[3092.80 --> 3094.80]  In life as the Messiah
[3095.80 --> 3097.80]  He's preparing to be our king
[3098.80 --> 3099.80]  Our high priest
[3100.80 --> 3101.80]  And through all this confusion and chaos
[3101.80 --> 3102.80]  We humans experience
[3103.80 --> 3104.80]  When we go through these periods of time
[3105.80 --> 3107.80]  We tend to try to plan out what we want to do
[3108.80 --> 3111.80]  We look for mentors and counselors to seek guidance for what we should do
[3112.80 --> 3114.80]  Like Joseph trying to prepare his son for life as an adult
[3114.80 --> 3115.80]  But Jesus was different in this way
[3115.80 --> 3119.80]  Jesus didn't ask Joseph or Mary what he should do for work
[3120.80 --> 3123.80]  Or if he should go to school
[3124.80 --> 3127.80]  He knew what he was supposed to do
[3128.80 --> 3129.80]  Didn't you know?
[3130.80 --> 3133.80]  I must be at my father's house
[3134.80 --> 3136.80]  He knows who he is
[3136.80 --> 3138.80]  He knows who his father is
[3138.80 --> 3139.80]  He knows who his father is
[3139.80 --> 3140.80]  And who he knows what he has to do
[3141.80 --> 3143.80]  He knows he's the Messiah
[3144.80 --> 3146.80]  He knows he's the son of God
[3147.80 --> 3151.80]  And he knows that preparing for that task was worth his parents being scared for a few days
[3152.80 --> 3154.80]  Now, he probably didn't intend that
[3155.80 --> 3157.80]  By his own admission he did say, why were you looking for me?
[3157.80 --> 3159.80]  Didn't you know I was supposed to be here?
[3160.80 --> 3164.80]  In this moment of transition in life when the chaos builds up
[3165.80 --> 3167.80]  And the pressure and the responsibilities build up
[3168.80 --> 3170.80]  When identity is being formed in him
[3171.80 --> 3172.80]  Jesus goes to his father
[3174.80 --> 3175.80]  What does my father want me to do?
[3176.80 --> 3178.80]  What does my father say I am?
[3179.80 --> 3181.80]  We see this in other parts of Jesus' life
[3182.80 --> 3183.80]  When he goes to his baptism
[3184.80 --> 3185.80]  We hear God say, this is my son
[3185.80 --> 3186.80]  This is my son
[3187.80 --> 3188.80]  When he enters Jerusalem on the donkey
[3188.80 --> 3190.80]  And all the people are waving the palm branches
[3190.80 --> 3191.80]  And they call him king
[3192.80 --> 3193.80]  God says, this is my son
[3194.80 --> 3195.80]  At his transfiguration
[3195.80 --> 3196.80]  God says, this is my son
[3197.80 --> 3198.80]  Listen to him
[3199.80 --> 3200.80]  And then when he's in the garden
[3201.80 --> 3202.80]  He prayed to God for guidance
[3202.80 --> 3203.80]  And he said, your will, not mine
[3205.80 --> 3207.80]  Through the gospels there is a focused emphasis
[3208.80 --> 3210.80]  On how much he went away to pray alone
[3211.80 --> 3213.80]  And you'll hear Jesus say things like
[3213.80 --> 3214.80]  I do what my father does
[3215.80 --> 3216.80]  I do the work of my father
[3216.80 --> 3218.80]  What the father does, the son does also
[3219.80 --> 3221.80]  Jesus was so concerned
[3222.80 --> 3223.80]  With what God wanted him to do
[3224.80 --> 3226.80]  So concerned with who God saw him as
[3227.80 --> 3228.80]  That Jesus knew it was okay
[3229.80 --> 3230.80]  That his parents were scared
[3231.80 --> 3232.80]  You can hear it in his words
[3232.80 --> 3233.80]  Did you know?
[3234.80 --> 3235.80]  No?
[3235.80 --> 3236.80]  I must be here
[3236.80 --> 3237.80]  I must do my father's business
[3238.80 --> 3239.80]  This is who he is
[3241.80 --> 3242.80]  Jesus' own words
[3242.80 --> 3245.80]  He says, do not think I have come to abolish the law or the prophets
[3246.80 --> 3247.80]  I have not come to abolish them
[3248.80 --> 3249.80]  But to fulfill them
[3250.80 --> 3251.80]  Jesus came out to live
[3252.80 --> 3254.80]  The life the law describes perfectly
[3255.80 --> 3256.80]  Obediently
[3257.80 --> 3258.80]  To glorify his father
[3259.80 --> 3260.80]  So that he could be the high priest
[3261.80 --> 3262.80]  The atonement for our sins
[3263.80 --> 3265.80]  Jesus lived out that perfect life
[3266.80 --> 3268.80]  He lived out the identity of the perfect son
[3268.80 --> 3269.80]  Willing to obey his father
[3269.80 --> 3271.80]  Even if it killed him
[3272.80 --> 3273.80]  Why?
[3274.80 --> 3277.80]  So that we can share in that identity
[3278.80 --> 3280.80]  He was born
[3281.80 --> 3282.80]  Lived a normal life
[3283.80 --> 3285.80]  Worked, slept, cried
[3286.80 --> 3287.80]  Laughed, loved, and died
[3287.80 --> 3289.80]  And for a lot of his 30 years
[3290.80 --> 3291.80]  It was probably mundane
[3292.80 --> 3293.80]  Just like our life
[3294.80 --> 3295.80]  So that we here and now
[3296.80 --> 3297.80]  In this life to come
[3297.80 --> 3298.80]  And to the life to come to the next
[3299.80 --> 3300.80]  Could be transformed into children of God
[3301.80 --> 3304.80]  So that we could have a perfect father like he did
[3305.80 --> 3308.80]  He lived our weird and ordinary life and died
[3309.80 --> 3310.80]  So that by his resurrection
[3311.80 --> 3312.80]  We could live forever more
[3313.80 --> 3314.80]  And have his holy perfect father
[3314.80 --> 3317.80]  Jesus, unlike ourselves
[3318.80 --> 3320.80]  Lived a life dedicated to his father
[3321.80 --> 3323.80]  The pure and powerful statement
[3324.80 --> 3325.80]  Of a 12 year old boy
[3326.80 --> 3327.80]  I must
[3328.80 --> 3330.80]  Is a clear picture into his mentality
[3333.80 --> 3335.80]  I must be in my father's house
[3336.80 --> 3337.80]  Or I must be about my father's business
[3338.80 --> 3339.80]  He lived out the law perfectly
[3340.80 --> 3342.80]  Now we, by the grace of God
[3342.80 --> 3343.80]  And the grace of God
[3343.80 --> 3344.80]  Are gifted the identity of Christ
[3345.80 --> 3346.80]  That perfect sonship
[3347.80 --> 3348.80]  So that we don't have to
[3349.80 --> 3350.80]  Jesus must
[3351.80 --> 3352.80]  So that we may
[3353.80 --> 3354.80]  If we lived in the I must
[3355.80 --> 3356.80]  Then we wouldn't be free from the grip of sin
[3357.80 --> 3358.80]  And the need to obey
[3359.80 --> 3360.80]  And to live up to perfection
[3361.80 --> 3362.80]  This grace allows us to live free
[3363.80 --> 3364.80]  From the shame of failure
[3365.80 --> 3369.80]  We now may live in our father's house
[3369.80 --> 3372.80]  We may be about our father's business
[3373.80 --> 3374.80]  We as brothers in Christ
[3375.80 --> 3377.80]  With the identity that was placed on us by our father
[3378.80 --> 3380.80]  Can navigate these treacherous transition moments in our life
[3381.80 --> 3385.80]  When we face the chaos of change
[3386.80 --> 3387.80]  Having kids growing up
[3388.80 --> 3389.80]  Getting old, retiring
[3390.80 --> 3391.80]  We can rely on our father's voice
[3392.80 --> 3395.80]  Like Jesus who heard his father speak to him at his baptism
[3395.80 --> 3396.80]  At the entrance to Jerusalem
[3397.80 --> 3398.80]  Or at the transfiguration
[3399.80 --> 3400.80]  You are my son
[3401.80 --> 3403.80]  His father
[3404.80 --> 3405.80]  Our father
[3406.80 --> 3408.80]  Is saying the same thing about us
[3409.80 --> 3410.80]  To us
[3411.80 --> 3414.80]  And he sometimes
[3415.80 --> 3417.80]  Most of the time does this through his word
[3417.80 --> 3421.80]  That also includes pastors and teachers
[3422.80 --> 3423.80]  Loved ones and friends
[3424.80 --> 3425.80]  And even sometimes an actual voice from on high
[3426.80 --> 3429.80]  God sees us as his children
[3430.80 --> 3431.80]  And rather than living out our lives
[3432.80 --> 3433.80]  Seeing ourselves as we do
[3434.80 --> 3437.80]  People living as if we must live this perfect life
[3438.80 --> 3439.80]  To earn forgiveness
[3440.80 --> 3442.80]  We can live out our normal life
[3443.80 --> 3444.80]  Ordinary, mundane, painful
[3444.80 --> 3447.80]  Happy, exciting, anxious, astounding lives
[3448.80 --> 3449.80]  As children of God
[3450.80 --> 3451.80]  All because he did it for us
[3452.80 --> 3455.80]  And so when we go through these transition moments in life
[3456.80 --> 3457.80]  Growing up, getting old, having kids
[3458.80 --> 3460.80]  And eventually that final transition from this life to the next
[3461.80 --> 3462.80]  We can do so with peace
[3463.80 --> 3468.80]  Remembering that we are sons and daughters of our father
[3469.80 --> 3470.80]  Amen?
[3470.80 --> 3473.80]  Okay
[3474.80 --> 3475.80]  Let's pray
[3482.80 --> 3483.80]  Father, thank you
[3484.80 --> 3485.80]  Thank you for this wonderful day
[3486.80 --> 3489.80]  This wonderful, cold, blizzardy, dreary day
[3490.80 --> 3492.80]  Thank you, Lord, that we can hear your voice
[3493.80 --> 3496.80]  We know that we are children of God
[3497.80 --> 3498.80]  Your children
[3498.80 --> 3500.80]  We're brothers with Christ
[3501.80 --> 3503.80]  And I pray that you would fill us with the Holy Spirit
[3504.80 --> 3505.80]  As you filled Jesus
[3506.80 --> 3508.80]  For the rest of the week, Lord
[3509.80 --> 3510.80]  Bless us
[3511.80 --> 3512.80]  Amen
[3517.80 --> 3518.80]  Please stand as we sing
[3518.80 --> 3521.80]  Amen
[3538.80 --> 3539.80]  vessels lost in darkest night
[3539.80 --> 3543.80]  Yet though I knew he would wear
[3543.80 --> 3558.12]  And though I knew you were gay, the sin that promised joy and life, it led me to the grave.
[3558.12 --> 3568.16]  I had the hope that you would own the level to your will.
[3568.16 --> 3578.16]  And if you had not loved me first, your will would live me still.
[3578.16 --> 3608.16] 
[3608.16 --> 3617.38]  And I beheld God's love displayed, you suffered in my face.
[3617.38 --> 3626.38]  You bore the wrath, reserved for me, now all I have is you.
