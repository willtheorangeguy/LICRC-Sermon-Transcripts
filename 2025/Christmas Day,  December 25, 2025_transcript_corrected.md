[1551.08 → 1571.62] Praise the mount I'm fixed upon it, mount of God's redeeming love.
[1571.62 → 1581.96] Praise the mount I'm fixed upon it, mount of God's redeeming love.
[1584.54 → 1588.70] Please be seated and join me in a Christmas prayer.
[1588.70 → 1608.00] Jesus, Emmanuel, on this day of wonder we pause, not to add to the noise, but to lean into the quiet mystery of your arrival.
[1608.86 → 1614.04] You came not with fanfare, but with humility, not in power, but in vulnerability.
[1614.82 → 1617.26] Help us to see you in the unexpected places.
[1617.26 → 1622.82] Lord, we confess we often race past the manger to get to the next thing.
[1623.70 → 1624.78] Slow our hearts today.
[1625.62 → 1627.62] Let us sit in the awe of your presence.
[1628.80 → 1634.92] May we, like the shepherds, carry our ordinary lives into the extraordinary story of your love breaking in.
[1636.02 → 1642.22] May we, like Mary, treasure the weight of your promises, holding them close even when they're hard to understand.
[1642.22 → 1650.38] May we, like Joseph, listen for your guidance in the midst of uncertainty, trusting your hand even when the path isn't clear.
[1651.70 → 1653.38] Jesus, you are our peace.
[1653.94 → 1659.14] In a world that can feel heavy with weariness and worry, teach us to rest in your unshakeable grace.
[1660.00 → 1661.66] You are the light of the world.
[1662.28 → 1664.72] Shine through us in small, steady ways.
[1664.72 → 1668.78] Let our lives point others to the hope that only you can bring.
[1670.06 → 1674.50] May our hearts, homes, and hands reflect the generosity of your love today.
[1675.96 → 1681.42] Help us to give, to forgive, and to live in the freedom you came to offer.
[1682.44 → 1686.96] We celebrate you, Jesus, not just your birth, but your life, death, and resurrection.
[1687.66 → 1691.44] Thank you for stepping into our story so we could be part of yours.
[1691.72 → 1692.04] Amen.
[1692.04 → 1692.16] Amen.
[1692.16 → 1692.20] Amen.
[1694.72 → 1699.74] Please stand and sing with us.
[1701.30 → 1707.02] Please rise.
[1707.02 → 1722.02] Glory to God

[1744.08 → 1749.04] Praise be on earth
[1749.04 → 1758.28] To the peace of whom God divides
[1758.28 → 1762.48] Glory to God
[1762.48 → 1764.48] Glory to God
[1764.48 → 1768.32] In the highest
[1768.32 → 1772.48] Glory to God
[1772.48 → 1778.48] In the highest
[1778.48 → 1784.32] Praise be on earth
[1784.32 → 1788.48] Praise be on earth
[1788.48 → 1794.48] Praise be on earth
[1794.48 → 1799.48] Praise be on earth
[1799.48 → 1802.48] To the people
[1802.48 → 1804.48] To the people
[1804.48 → 1808.48] To the people
[1808.48 → 1810.48] Whom God delights in
[1810.48 → 1812.48] To the people
[1812.48 → 1814.48] Whom God delights in
[1814.48 → 1816.48] Whom God delights in
[1816.48 → 1817.48] Glory to God
[1817.48 → 1829.48] Glory to God
[1829.48 → 1830.48] Glory to God
[1830.48 → 1832.48] In the highest
[1832.48 → 1833.48] In the highest
[1833.48 → 1834.48] In the highest
[1834.48 → 1841.48] In the highest, in the highest
[1841.48 → 1848.48] Praise be on earth
[1848.48 → 1852.48] Praise be on earth
[1852.48 → 1863.48] To the people who God delights in
[1863.48 → 1869.48] Amen
[1869.48 → 1875.48] Amen
[1893.48 → 1899.48] I want to take just a moment and lead us in a little bit of a prayer
[1899.48 → 1903.48] Before we pray, just a couple notes
[1903.48 → 1909.48] First, there is an opportunity to give in your tithes and offerings today
[1909.48 → 1913.48] We're doing a little bit differently because it is Christmas
[1913.48 → 1917.48] And so the ordinary ways to give are still available
[1917.48 → 1921.48] And you can see that there on the slide behind me
[1921.48 → 1927.48] In addition to that, our giving today is in support of Jody and Uriel Gonzalez
[1927.48 → 1929.48] We support our missionaries in Mexico
[1929.48 → 1931.48] We support them through C10
[1931.48 → 1933.48] As many of you are aware
[1933.48 → 1939.48] They had a bit of a circumstance happen with their move to a new property
[1939.48 → 1941.48] And a washout that took place
[1941.48 → 1945.48] And so we've been working with them and supporting them to repair that
[1945.48 → 1949.48] And hopefully to partner with them in that work
[1949.48 → 1951.48] And so you'll have an opportunity to give
[1951.48 → 1953.48] As you leave today
[1953.48 → 1955.48] Their deacons will be at the doors
[1955.48 → 1956.48] And they'll have the bags there
[1956.48 → 1958.48] You can give either directly there
[1958.48 → 1961.48] There are envelopes in the seats in front of you
[1961.48 → 1964.48] Please just designate your giving as you do so
[1964.48 → 1965.48] Or you can give online
[1965.48 → 1968.48] Additionally, before we pray
[1968.48 → 1971.48] We have been praying for the past number of weeks
[1971.48 → 1975.48] For Tessa, who's Jerry's daughter and Enoch's sister
[1975.48 → 1977.48] Tessa is here this morning
[1977.48 → 1979.48] And she would like to say thank you to everyone
[1979.48 → 1982.48] For our praying for her
[1982.48 → 1984.48] And so Tessa, we are grateful that you are here
[1984.48 → 1987.48] We continue to pray that God will work in your life
[1987.48 → 1989.48] So thanks for being with us this morning
[1989.48 → 1997.48] Let's come to God in a time of prayer together
[1997.48 → 2007.48] Glory to you, God
[2007.48 → 2010.48] Glory to you in the highest
[2010.48 → 2013.48] And peace on earth
[2013.48 → 2017.48] To those on whom your favour rests
[2017.48 → 2021.48] God, as we gather today for worship
[2021.48 → 2025.48] May we experience your favour resting on us
[2025.48 → 2028.48] May we experience your peace that comes
[2028.48 → 2031.48] In the presence of your Holy Spirit
[2031.48 → 2036.48] Your peace that comes because you have come to us
[2037.48 → 2041.48] God, we pray that at this moment
[2041.48 → 2042.48] And today
[2042.48 → 2046.48] That you would be glorified in our midst
[2046.48 → 2048.48] We pray that at this moment
[2048.48 → 2050.48] And today and every day going forward
[2050.48 → 2055.48] We would know the sustaining power of your presence
[2055.48 → 2059.48] God, as we gather today
[2059.48 → 2062.48] So many of us with family or with friends
[2062.48 → 2067.48] We are especially mindful of those who don't gather with us
[2067.48 → 2069.48] Mindful of those whom we have lost
[2069.48 → 2073.48] Mindful of those whom relationships are strained
[2073.48 → 2076.48] And so we pray
[2076.48 → 2081.48] May the peace of this season
[2081.48 → 2084.48] Pervade even into those relationships
[2086.48 → 2089.48] May the memories of joy and stories
[2090.48 → 2092.48] Encourage our hearts today
[2092.48 → 2096.48] May we be the kind of people who
[2096.48 → 2098.48] Because of the peace that we have from you
[2098.48 → 2100.48] Are able to have hard
[2100.48 → 2103.48] Reconciling and restoring conversations
[2103.48 → 2105.48] With friends and families
[2105.48 → 2107.48] With kids and loved ones
[2107.48 → 2111.48] And may we be the kind of people who
[2111.48 → 2113.48] Know your presence
[2113.48 → 2117.48] And so God for those who are sick
[2117.48 → 2120.48] For who are in the midst of treatment
[2120.48 → 2121.48] Who are awaiting treatment
[2122.48 → 2124.48] For those who have treatment upcoming
[2124.48 → 2126.48] Even already this weekend
[2126.48 → 2128.48] We pray for your hand to be upon them
[2128.48 → 2131.48] Give them peace and sustaining power
[2131.48 → 2136.48] And we pray that in this time of questioning
[2136.48 → 2138.48] Answers may come
[2139.48 → 2140.48] That a direction may be discerned
[2140.48 → 2143.48] And that a path forward may reveal itself
[2144.48 → 2146.48] And while we wait
[2147.48 → 2149.48] May we know your peace
[2150.48 → 2153.48] May we be a people who wait well
[2153.48 → 2156.48] Because of your presence with us
[2156.48 → 2159.48] Father God we praise you
[2159.48 → 2161.48] For this great and glorious day
[2161.48 → 2163.48] We praise you for the magnificence
[2163.48 → 2165.48] Of your coming down to us
[2165.48 → 2167.48] And may it be this morning
[2167.48 → 2168.48] As we turn to your word
[2168.48 → 2171.48] That we glimpse you more clearly
[2172.48 → 2174.48] May we hear the voice of Jesus
[2175.48 → 2177.48] Resonating in our hearts
[2177.48 → 2178.48] And transforming our lives
[2179.48 → 2180.48] And stirring in us
[2180.48 → 2182.48] A Holy Spirit imagination
[2182.48 → 2184.48] For what is possible
[2184.48 → 2186.48] Because of what you have done
[2187.48 → 2190.48] We pray this Jesus in your most holy name
[2191.48 → 2192.48] Amen
[2193.48 → 2194.48] Amen
[2196.48 → 2197.48] If you have a Bible
[2197.48 → 2198.48] I want to invite you to
[2199.48 → 2201.48] Open it up to John 1
[2202.48 → 2203.48] If you have a device
[2203.48 → 2204.48] You can get that ready
[2205.48 → 2206.48] And we're going to read together
[2207.48 → 2208.48] From John 1
[2208.48 → 2210.48] The first 14 verses
[2210.48 → 2212.48] Of the Gospel of John
[2212.48 → 2225.48] Allow me to read God's word for us this morning
[2227.48 → 2229.48] In the beginning was the word
[2230.48 → 2231.48] And the word was with God
[2232.48 → 2233.48] And the word was God
[2234.48 → 2235.48] He was with God in the beginning
[2236.48 → 2239.48] Through him all things were made
[2239.48 → 2241.48] Without him nothing was made
[2242.48 → 2243.48] That has been made
[2244.48 → 2245.48] In him was life
[2246.48 → 2249.48] And that life was the light of all mankind
[2250.48 → 2251.48] The light shines in the darkness
[2252.48 → 2253.48] And the darkness has not overcome it
[2254.48 → 2257.48] There was a man sent from God
[2258.48 → 2259.48] Whose name was John
[2260.48 → 2262.48] He came as a witness to testify concerning that light
[2263.48 → 2264.48] So that through him all might believe
[2264.48 → 2266.48] He himself was not the light
[2267.48 → 2269.48] He came only as a witness to the light
[2270.48 → 2273.48] The true light that gives light to everyone
[2274.48 → 2275.48] Was coming into the world
[2276.48 → 2277.48] He was in the world
[2277.48 → 2279.48] And though the world was made through him
[2280.48 → 2281.48] The world did not recognize him
[2282.48 → 2283.48] He came to that which was his own
[2284.48 → 2286.48] But his own did not receive him
[2287.48 → 2289.48] Yet to all who did receive him
[2289.48 → 2291.48] To those who believed in his name
[2292.48 → 2294.48] He gave the right to become children of God
[2295.48 → 2297.48] Children born not of natural descent
[2298.48 → 2299.48] Nor of human decision
[2300.48 → 2301.48] Or a husband's will
[2301.48 → 2302.48] But born of God
[2303.48 → 2305.48] The word became flesh
[2306.48 → 2309.48] And made his dwelling among us
[2310.48 → 2312.48] We have seen his glory
[2313.48 → 2315.48] The glory of the one and only son
[2315.48 → 2316.48] Who came from the father
[2316.48 → 2318.48] Full of grace
[2319.48 → 2320.48] And truth
[2321.48 → 2322.48] This is the word of the Lord
[2323.48 → 2324.48] Amen
[2328.48 → 2331.48] Okay, to start this morning
[2332.48 → 2334.48] I want to acknowledge that this is
[2335.48 → 2337.48] Perhaps a deep cut or a bit of a niche pull
[2338.48 → 2339.48] For some of you
[2340.48 → 2341.48] But have any of you heard of the play
[2342.48 → 2343.48] Waiting for Godot?
[2343.48 → 2346.48] Six people, excellent
[2347.48 → 2350.48] We have like five or six cultured people over here
[2351.48 → 2352.48] And the rest of you
[2353.48 → 2354.48] And Kevin, yeah
[2355.48 → 2359.48] Waiting for Godot is a French play
[2360.48 → 2361.48] Written by Samuel Beckett
[2362.48 → 2363.48] In the early 1950s
[2364.48 → 2368.48] It emerges from the post-World War II
[2369.48 → 2370.48] Absurdist movement
[2370.48 → 2373.48] That wrestled with meaning
[2374.48 → 2375.48] In a world shattered
[2376.48 → 2379.48] By the destruction of post-war Europe
[2380.48 → 2384.48] And full of disillusionment and questioning
[2385.48 → 2386.48] The play follows two men
[2387.48 → 2389.48] Vladimir and Estrogen
[2390.48 → 2393.48] Who wait by a roadside for someone named Godot
[2394.48 → 2395.48] Hence the title
[2396.48 → 2398.48] Godot, however, never arrives
[2398.48 → 2399.48] Never arrives
[2400.48 → 2401.48] And so these two men
[2401.48 → 2403.48] Fill the silence with talk
[2404.48 → 2406.48] And with sort of ritualistic behaviour
[2407.48 → 2408.48] And with a kind of scheming
[2409.48 → 2411.48] Not because they're certain he will come
[2412.48 → 2415.48] But because they're waiting together
[2416.48 → 2418.48] Provides shape for their lives
[2419.48 → 2422.48] Gives them a moment to do something
[2422.48 → 2424.48] The world that they encounter
[2425.48 → 2428.48] As different people come on and off-stage
[2429.48 → 2431.48] Is not so much hostile to them
[2432.48 → 2433.48] As it is indifferent
[2434.48 → 2435.48] To the plight
[2436.48 → 2439.48] And the characters are terrified
[2440.48 → 2441.48] That if Godot doesn't come
[2442.48 → 2443.48] Nothing has meaning
[2444.48 → 2447.48] And there is no safety or purpose
[2447.48 → 2448.48] Or purpose
[2449.48 → 2450.48] So like I said, the play expresses
[2451.48 → 2452.48] This post-World War II
[2453.48 → 2454.48] Fractured belief
[2455.48 → 2456.48] In the presumption of progress
[2457.48 → 2458.48] Right?
[2459.48 → 2460.48] This era is really the seedbed
[2461.48 → 2463.48] For what will become the post-modern philosophies
[2464.48 → 2465.48] Of French deconstructionism
[2466.48 → 2467.48] And relativity
[2468.48 → 2469.48] And in the midst of it
[2470.48 → 2471.48] The world is being told that hope
[2471.48 → 2472.48] Hope and feeling hope
[2473.48 → 2474.48] Is less a conviction
[2475.48 → 2476.48] That we cling to
[2477.48 → 2478.48] And more of a necessary delusion
[2479.48 → 2480.48] That we have to give ourselves over to
[2481.48 → 2482.48] The play is telling us
[2483.48 → 2485.48] That companionship in the world
[2486.48 → 2487.48] Replaces transcendence
[2488.48 → 2490.48] And that we just have to exist
[2491.48 → 2492.48] As time passes us by
[2493.48 → 2494.48] And the last bit that I want to note here
[2495.48 → 2496.48] The play is trying to teach us
[2497.48 → 2500.48] That meaning must be improvised
[2502.48 → 2503.48] That you have to make it up
[2504.48 → 2506.48] And in this play
[2507.48 → 2509.48] Godot's most haunting feature
[2510.48 → 2512.48] Is not who he is
[2513.48 → 2515.48] Because we actually don't get to know that
[2516.48 → 2518.48] His most haunting feature
[2519.48 → 2520.48] Is that he is always
[2521.48 → 2522.48] Almost present
[2523.48 → 2525.48] He's always almost there
[2526.48 → 2528.48] And their longing
[2529.48 → 2530.48] Is never resolved
[2531.48 → 2532.48] The ache remains open
[2532.48 → 2533.48] Because their waiting
[2533.48 → 2534.48] Is never satisfied
[2535.48 → 2536.48] With his arrival
[2537.48 → 2539.48] And for some of us
[2540.48 → 2543.48] This 1953 play
[2544.48 → 2545.48] Echoes our current moment
[2546.48 → 2547.48] Echoes our hearts
[2548.48 → 2549.48] Even right now
[2550.48 → 2551.48] This is our truth, right?
[2552.48 → 2553.48] There's this ache in us
[2553.48 → 2554.48] For the always almost present
[2555.48 → 2556.48] There's a longing
[2557.48 → 2558.48] That's never resolved
[2558.48 → 2559.48] That exists in our heart
[2559.48 → 2560.48] That's always just open
[2561.48 → 2562.48] And hoping
[2563.48 → 2564.48] But we start to wonder
[2564.48 → 2565.48] Is hope realistic?
[2565.48 → 2566.48] Or is it this delusion
[2566.48 → 2567.48] I have to buy myself into?
[2568.48 → 2569.48] And Christmas, honestly
[2570.48 → 2571.48] Is for many people
[2572.48 → 2573.48] In the world today
[2573.48 → 2574.48] A chance to disguise this reality
[2575.48 → 2576.48] For just a brief moment
[2577.48 → 2578.48] Right?
[2578.48 → 2579.48] To colour over it
[2579.48 → 2580.48] With Hallmark movies
[2580.48 → 2581.48] Or to stuff it full
[2581.48 → 2582.48] With what Kevin says
[2582.48 → 2583.48] Are apparently uncounted calories
[2584.48 → 2586.48] But that fades
[2587.48 → 2588.48] And our hunger returns
[2589.48 → 2590.48] And that longing in us
[2591.48 → 2592.48] Rises up again
[2593.48 → 2595.48] Bubbles to the surface
[2596.48 → 2597.48] In Samuel Beckett's world
[2598.48 → 2599.48] Someone never comes
[2600.48 → 2601.48] In the modern search for meaning
[2602.48 → 2603.48] Everything feels elusive
[2603.48 → 2610.48] Just out there
[2611.48 → 2612.48] Always almost present
[2613.48 → 2614.48] But the truth of Christmas
[2615.48 → 2620.48] That shines so bright for us this morning
[2621.48 → 2622.48] Is that someone is coming
[2623.48 → 2624.48] That someone has come
[2624.48 → 2625.48] And in fact
[2625.48 → 2626.48] That someone will come again
[2627.48 → 2628.48] Right?
[2628.48 → 2629.48] And that contrast is that
[2629.48 → 2630.48] It's the moment of the world
[2630.48 → 2631.48] Right?
[2631.48 → 2633.48] And that contrast is powerful
[2634.48 → 2635.48] In Beckett's world
[2636.48 → 2638.48] Waiting doesn't culminate in arrival
[2639.48 → 2640.48] In John's Gospel
[2641.48 → 2642.48] Waiting ends with incarnation
[2643.48 → 2644.48] Right?
[2645.48 → 2647.48] Where Beckett's characters fill the silence with talk
[2648.48 → 2650.48] So that they don't disappear into nothingness
[2651.48 → 2652.48] John proclaims boldly
[2653.48 → 2654.48] The word became flesh
[2655.48 → 2657.48] And made his dwelling among us
[2657.48 → 2658.48] Waiting for Godot
[2659.48 → 2660.48] Waiting for Godot
[2660.48 → 2661.48] Is what the world looks like
[2661.48 → 2662.48] If verse 14 never happens
[2662.48 → 2666.48] And at the deepest level
[2667.48 → 2668.48] The human longing
[2669.48 → 2671.48] Beneath all other longings
[2672.48 → 2673.48] Is not a longing simply for answers
[2674.48 → 2675.48] Or for relief
[2675.48 → 2676.48] Or for improvement
[2677.48 → 2678.48] It's the longing for presence
[2679.48 → 2680.48] Right?
[2680.48 → 2681.48] The longing to be with someone
[2682.48 → 2684.48] We ache to know that we are not alone
[2684.48 → 2686.48] And that reality itself
[2687.48 → 2688.48] Is not indifferent to us
[2689.48 → 2690.48] And that the meaning is not something
[2691.48 → 2693.48] We must manufacture alone in the dark
[2694.48 → 2695.48] This is the ache
[2696.48 → 2697.48] If you've been with us through our Advent season
[2698.48 → 2699.48] This is the ache of the waiting
[2700.48 → 2701.48] That Zechariah and Elizabeth
[2702.48 → 2703.48] That Anna and Simeon had
[2704.48 → 2706.48] This is the ache behind Mary's surrender
[2707.48 → 2708.48] And Joseph's obedience
[2709.48 → 2710.48] This is the ache behind the shepherds
[2711.48 → 2712.48] Needing to tell someone what they have seen
[2712.48 → 2715.48] And the Magi's longing to worship
[2716.48 → 2717.48] This is the ache behind the angels
[2718.48 → 2719.48] Singing a cosmic Christmas
[2720.48 → 2721.48] Instead of a cutesy one
[2722.48 → 2724.48] This is the ache of God with us
[2725.48 → 2726.48] Of God come down
[2727.48 → 2729.48] This is the ache of the word became flesh
[2730.48 → 2731.48] And dwelt among us
[2732.48 → 2734.48] Now, to be sure
[2735.48 → 2736.48] The world around us
[2737.48 → 2738.48] Doesn't deny that this ache exists
[2739.48 → 2740.48] And really, how could it?
[2740.48 → 2742.48] Because it's part of what it means to be created
[2743.48 → 2744.48] In the image of God
[2744.48 → 2745.48] Part of what it means to be human
[2745.48 → 2748.48] Is that this rests and resides in us
[2749.48 → 2750.48] But what the world does
[2750.48 → 2752.48] And tries to convince all of us to do
[2753.48 → 2754.48] Is to fill it
[2754.48 → 2755.48] To solve it without God
[2756.48 → 2758.48] The world whispers
[2759.48 → 2760.48] The echoes of the lie
[2761.48 → 2762.48] That you don't need God
[2762.48 → 2766.48] And so technology and constant connection
[2767.48 → 2768.48] Promise presence
[2769.48 → 2772.48] But it comes without real intimacy
[2773.48 → 2774.48] Right?
[2775.48 → 2776.48] Achievement and legacy
[2777.48 → 2778.48] Promise permanence
[2779.48 → 2781.48] But at the cost of real relationship
[2782.48 → 2785.48] Self-expression and the value of authenticity
[2786.48 → 2787.48] Promises meaning
[2787.48 → 2790.48] But it makes identity contingent on your feelings
[2791.48 → 2792.48] And the affirmations of other people
[2793.48 → 2796.48] Which, in my experience, are pretty fleeting
[2798.48 → 2800.48] Spirituality without incarnation
[2800.48 → 2801.48] Promises transcendence
[2801.48 → 2802.48] Promises transcendence
[2803.48 → 2804.48] And experience of the divine
[2804.48 → 2805.48] But it actually gives no place
[2806.48 → 2807.48] For it to live in you
[2812.48 → 2813.48] And if I can be
[2815.48 → 2817.48] Pastorally candid with you
[2819.48 → 2821.48] These approaches
[2822.48 → 2823.48] Aren't foolish
[2823.48 → 2824.48] But they are anemic
[2825.48 → 2828.48] And they're missing something
[2829.48 → 2830.48] They're earnest
[2831.48 → 2832.48] But they're built on our effort
[2833.48 → 2834.48] And not on God's grace
[2835.48 → 2836.48] Right?
[2836.48 → 2837.48] They're sophisticated
[2837.48 → 2838.48] And increasingly more so
[2839.48 → 2840.48] But they confuse the reality
[2841.48 → 2842.48] Of our circumstances
[2843.48 → 2844.48] The deeper truth
[2844.48 → 2845.48] That we're beginning to learn
[2845.48 → 2846.48] And see
[2846.48 → 2847.48] And reveal here
[2847.48 → 2848.48] Is that
[2848.48 → 2850.48] These ways of being in the world
[2850.48 → 2851.48] Are ultimately insufficient
[2851.48 → 2853.48] To hold the weight of glory
[2854.48 → 2855.48] That we place on them
[2856.48 → 2857.48] And John
[2858.48 → 2859.48] Already knows this
[2859.48 → 2860.48] He names this tragedy
[2861.48 → 2862.48] With an almost brutal clarity
[2863.48 → 2864.48] In verse 10
[2865.48 → 2866.48] He says
[2867.48 → 2868.48] He was in the world
[2868.48 → 2869.48] And though the world was made through him
[2870.48 → 2872.48] The world did not recognize him
[2873.48 → 2875.48] He came to that which was his own
[2876.48 → 2878.48] But his own did not receive him
[2878.48 → 2879.48] This
[2881.48 → 2882.48] Ache in us
[2883.48 → 2884.48] Remains
[2885.48 → 2886.48] Because the world rejects
[2887.48 → 2888.48] And doesn't even recognize
[2889.48 → 2890.48] The very one who made us
[2891.48 → 2894.48] And the only one who can satisfy us
[2895.48 → 2897.48] The true answer to our need
[2898.48 → 2899.48] And to our waiting
[2900.48 → 2901.48] And to our longing
[2901.48 → 2902.48] Is the arrival of God with us
[2903.48 → 2906.48] The God-man, Emmanuel, Jesus
[2906.48 → 2907.48] Jesus
[2908.48 → 2910.48] And we can know that this is true
[2911.48 → 2913.48] Because he is before all things
[2914.48 → 2915.48] In the beginning was the word
[2916.48 → 2917.48] And the word was with God
[2918.48 → 2919.48] And the word was God
[2919.48 → 2920.48] He was with God
[2921.48 → 2922.48] In the beginning
[2923.48 → 2924.48] He is before all of this
[2925.48 → 2928.48] And if we want anything that lasts after all of this
[2929.48 → 2930.48] Kind of makes sense to me
[2931.48 → 2933.48] That we would look to what is there before all of this
[2933.48 → 2934.48] Before there was longing
[2936.48 → 2937.48] There was the word
[2938.48 → 2940.48] And the story of the word
[2941.48 → 2942.48] It doesn't begin in a manger
[2943.48 → 2946.48] The story of Christmas actually begins already at creation
[2947.48 → 2948.48] Right?
[2948.48 → 2949.48] Through him all things were made
[2950.48 → 2952.48] Without him nothing was made that has been made
[2953.48 → 2954.48] In him was life
[2955.48 → 2958.48] And that life was the light of all mankind
[2958.48 → 2963.48] The word is the light of all humanity
[2964.48 → 2966.48] The true light that gives light to everyone
[2967.48 → 2968.48] Was coming into the world
[2969.48 → 2970.48] And then comes this sentence
[2971.48 → 2972.48] Right?
[2972.48 → 2974.48] This reality redefining truth
[2975.48 → 2976.48] The word became flesh
[2977.48 → 2979.48] And made his dwelling among us
[2981.48 → 2982.48] The counterpoint
[2983.48 → 2984.48] Right?
[2984.48 → 2985.48] The one that we have to attempt to reach God
[2985.48 → 2986.48] Or to reject God
[2987.48 → 2989.48] Is God coming to us?
[2990.48 → 2994.48] So unlike when waiting for Godot
[2995.48 → 2996.48] When waiting for God
[2997.48 → 2998.48] He actually shows up
[2999.48 → 3004.48] But this is the strange miracle of Christmas
[3005.48 → 3009.48] And this is the part that the story
[3009.48 → 3011.48] The story and the people of the story
[3011.48 → 3012.48] And the people of today
[3012.48 → 3013.48] And the people of today
[3013.48 → 3015.48] Often unbeknownst to them
[3015.48 → 3017.48] Still reenact every Christmas
[3018.48 → 3019.48] And increasingly so
[3020.48 → 3021.48] In our post-Christian culture
[3021.48 → 3024.48] We reenact this every day of the year
[3026.48 → 3029.48] The world didn't recognize Jesus
[3030.48 → 3031.48] As God come down
[3032.48 → 3034.48] Not because he was absent
[3034.48 → 3038.48] But because he was too close
[3039.48 → 3041.48] Because he was too humble
[3042.48 → 3043.48] He was too embodied
[3044.48 → 3045.48] Too weak
[3046.48 → 3047.48] Too much a baby
[3048.48 → 3049.48] Too ordinary
[3050.48 → 3052.48] To fit into our expectations
[3053.48 → 3054.48] Of God showing up
[3055.48 → 3056.48] Right?
[3056.48 → 3058.48] Most people missed the Messiah
[3059.48 → 3061.48] Because they couldn't see past their own convictions
[3061.48 → 3063.48] And ideas about what God should do
[3064.48 → 3065.48] And the same is true today
[3066.48 → 3067.48] Right?
[3067.48 → 3068.48] And this isn't just out there
[3069.48 → 3070.48] It's in here
[3070.48 → 3071.48] And even more so
[3071.48 → 3072.48] It's in here
[3073.48 → 3074.48] Right?
[3074.48 → 3075.48] My ideas
[3076.48 → 3077.48] About what God should do
[3078.48 → 3080.48] Lead me to miss
[3081.48 → 3082.48] What God is doing
[3083.48 → 3086.48] I miss him
[3087.48 → 3088.48] Because God is gentler
[3089.48 → 3090.48] Than I expect
[3092.48 → 3093.48] I miss him
[3093.48 → 3095.48] Because he's often slower
[3096.48 → 3097.48] Than I want
[3098.48 → 3099.48] And I miss him
[3100.48 → 3102.48] Because he is regularly
[3103.48 → 3104.48] Closer to me
[3105.48 → 3106.48] Than I am comfortable with
[3109.48 → 3110.48] Look
[3111.48 → 3113.48] Maybe you have really strong ideas
[3114.48 → 3115.48] About what God should do
[3116.48 → 3117.48] Right?
[3117.48 → 3119.48] If God is really at work in the world
[3119.48 → 3121.48] You expect your problems to resolve
[3122.48 → 3123.48] Your diseases to be healed
[3124.48 → 3125.48] Your habits to break
[3126.48 → 3127.48] You expect clarity to
[3128.48 → 3129.48] For what to do next to come
[3130.48 → 3132.48] You expect peace to arrive quickly
[3133.48 → 3134.48] And when that doesn't happen
[3135.48 → 3136.48] You then assume that God is distant
[3137.48 → 3138.48] Or that he's somehow disappointed with you
[3139.48 → 3140.48] Or that he's silent
[3141.48 → 3143.48] Because he doesn't love you
[3143.48 → 3144.48] Love you
[3145.48 → 3146.48] But what if
[3147.48 → 3148.48] What if you're not missing God
[3149.48 → 3150.48] Because he's absent
[3151.48 → 3152.48] But because he is present
[3153.48 → 3154.48] In a way that you didn't plan for
[3156.48 → 3158.48] He's present in a way that you can't anticipate
[3158.48 → 3159.48] When Christ comes near us
[3160.48 → 3163.48] When Christ comes near us in our mess
[3164.48 → 3165.48] We often misread his presence
[3166.48 → 3167.48] Right?
[3167.48 → 3169.48] We brace ourselves thinking that judgment is coming
[3170.48 → 3172.48] When in fact mercy has arrived
[3173.48 → 3174.48] Right?
[3174.48 → 3175.48] We wait for God to fix us
[3176.48 → 3178.48] But instead he chooses to sustain us
[3179.48 → 3180.48] In the midst of the trial
[3181.48 → 3182.48] We look for him above us
[3183.48 → 3184.48] Kind of cowering
[3184.48 → 3185.48] Because we're worried about judgment
[3185.48 → 3186.48] When in fact
[3186.48 → 3187.48] He's standing right beside you
[3187.48 → 3188.48] With his arms open
[3188.48 → 3189.48] Waiting to embrace you
[3190.48 → 3195.48] The tragedy of this moment is
[3196.48 → 3197.48] Is not that God has failed to show up
[3198.48 → 3200.48] It's that he's shown up in humility
[3201.48 → 3204.48] And humility is easy to overlook
[3205.48 → 3208.48] To put it another way
[3209.48 → 3211.48] Humility doesn't get clicks
[3211.48 → 3216.48] God comes close enough to be touched
[3217.48 → 3219.48] God comes close enough to be misunderstood
[3220.48 → 3222.48] He comes close enough to be rejected
[3223.48 → 3225.48] And that's why John doesn't simply say
[3226.48 → 3227.48] That the word spoke to us
[3227.48 → 3228.48] Or that the word ruled over us
[3229.48 → 3230.48] But he says the word became flesh
[3231.48 → 3233.48] And made his dwelling among us
[3234.48 → 3235.48] The God that we long for
[3236.48 → 3237.48] Doesn't stand at a distance
[3237.48 → 3238.48] Waiting for us to improve
[3238.48 → 3240.48] Waiting for us to come to him
[3241.48 → 3242.48] He comes near
[3243.48 → 3244.48] Lowly in heart
[3244.48 → 3245.48] And gentle in spirit
[3245.48 → 3246.48] To be with us
[3247.48 → 3248.48] Christmas is not God giving
[3249.48 → 3250.48] What we expected
[3251.48 → 3253.48] It is God giving us himself
[3261.48 → 3262.48] And so that's the thing
[3263.48 → 3265.48] Alright, we can't understand Christmas
[3265.48 → 3266.48] Unless we understand
[3266.48 → 3267.48] Unless we understand
[3268.48 → 3269.48] Who has come
[3270.48 → 3272.48] The church throughout history
[3273.48 → 3274.48] Has worked hard
[3275.48 → 3276.48] To help us understand
[3277.48 → 3278.48] Who has come
[3279.48 → 3280.48] By pulling together different creeds
[3281.48 → 3282.48] And confessions, different statements
[3283.48 → 3286.48] And this past year, 2025
[3287.48 → 3289.48] Was the 1700th anniversary
[3290.48 → 3291.48] Of the Nicene Creed
[3291.48 → 3292.48] Which comes to us
[3292.48 → 3293.48] Which comes to us
[3293.48 → 3295.48] From 325 A.D.
[3296.48 → 3297.48] And I just want to put
[3297.48 → 3298.48] A part of that on the screen
[3298.48 → 3299.48] Behind us
[3299.48 → 3300.48] Holding up
[3301.48 → 3302.48] The Gospel of John
[3302.48 → 3303.48] That we have read beside it
[3304.48 → 3305.48] As we try to wrestle with
[3306.48 → 3308.48] Who is that has come
[3309.48 → 3312.48] Right, this is what John
[3313.48 → 3315.48] And the church coming out of this text
[3316.48 → 3317.48] Have taught us
[3318.48 → 3319.48] Who has come at Christmas
[3319.48 → 3320.48] First
[3321.48 → 3324.48] That he is begotten of the Father
[3325.48 → 3326.48] Before all ages
[3327.48 → 3328.48] That is eternally begotten
[3329.48 → 3330.48] Not created, right?
[3330.48 → 3331.48] In the beginning was the Word
[3332.48 → 3334.48] That he is of the same essence
[3335.48 → 3336.48] As the Father
[3336.48 → 3337.48] The Word was with God
[3338.48 → 3339.48] And the Word was God
[3340.48 → 3341.48] And that through him
[3342.48 → 3343.48] All things were made
[3344.48 → 3346.48] Through him all things were made
[3346.48 → 3348.48] Without him nothing was made
[3349.48 → 3350.48] That has been made
[3351.48 → 3353.48] Right, this Jesus who comes
[3354.48 → 3356.48] Is not God's representative
[3357.48 → 3359.48] It's not some other lesser divine being
[3360.48 → 3361.48] It's not some moral teacher
[3361.48 → 3363.48] That people later chose to exalt
[3364.48 → 3366.48] This being who has come to us
[3367.48 → 3368.48] In the manger at Christmas
[3369.48 → 3370.48] Is true God from true God
[3370.48 → 3371.48] The eternal Son
[3372.48 → 3373.48] The one through whom
[3373.48 → 3374.48] And for whom
[3374.48 → 3375.48] All things exist
[3376.48 → 3379.48] Now stepping into his creation
[3380.48 → 3382.48] Christmas isn't God just sending help
[3383.48 → 3384.48] Christmas is God himself
[3385.48 → 3387.48] Coming into the world
[3388.48 → 3389.48] This is the miracle of Christmas
[3390.48 → 3391.48] That he who is mighty
[3392.48 → 3393.48] Has done a great thing
[3393.48 → 3394.48] Has taken on flesh
[3394.48 → 3395.48] And conquered death's sting
[3395.48 → 3396.48] Shattered the darkness
[3397.48 → 3398.48] And lifted our shame
[3400.48 → 3401.48] And so all of our waiting
[3402.48 → 3403.48] Obedience
[3403.48 → 3404.48] All of our worship
[3405.48 → 3406.48] All the heavenly declaration
[3407.48 → 3408.48] At this time
[3408.48 → 3410.48] Come together in Jesus Christ
[3411.48 → 3412.48] Emmanuel
[3413.48 → 3414.48] God with us
[3415.48 → 3416.48] And this is our big idea here
[3416.48 → 3417.48] This is the purpose of it all
[3418.48 → 3419.48] All waiting
[3419.48 → 3420.48] All obedience
[3420.48 → 3421.48] All worship
[3421.48 → 3422.48] All heavenly declaration
[3422.48 → 3424.48] Come together in Jesus Christ
[3425.48 → 3426.48] God with us
[3427.48 → 3428.48] What Elizabeth and Zechariah
[3429.48 → 3430.48] Anna and Simeon
[3430.48 → 3431.48] Waited for
[3431.48 → 3432.48] He fulfills
[3433.48 → 3434.48] What Mary and Joseph obeyed
[3434.48 → 3435.48] He accomplishes
[3436.48 → 3437.48] What the shepherds and the Magi
[3437.48 → 3438.48] Worshipped
[3438.48 → 3439.48] He is
[3440.48 → 3441.48] What the angels declared
[3441.48 → 3442.48] He brings about
[3443.48 → 3445.48] The word does not merely speak grace
[3446.48 → 3447.48] He is grace
[3448.48 → 3450.48] We have seen his glory
[3450.48 → 3452.48] The glory of the one and only son
[3452.48 → 3453.48] Who came from the father
[3453.48 → 3454.48] Full of grace
[3455.48 → 3456.48] And truth
[3456.48 → 3458.48] The word does not merely speak truth
[3458.48 → 3459.48] He is truth
[3460.48 → 3464.48] The answer
[3465.48 → 3470.48] The answer to our deepest ache
[3471.48 → 3472.48] Is right here
[3473.48 → 3475.48] Not explanation
[3475.48 → 3476.48] Not explanation
[3477.48 → 3478.48] But incarnation
[3479.48 → 3480.48] Not escape
[3481.48 → 3482.48] But presence
[3483.48 → 3484.48] Not improvement
[3484.48 → 3485.48] But communion
[3486.48 → 3487.48] With your God
[3488.48 → 3489.48] And look
[3490.48 → 3491.48] Here is the reality for us
[3492.48 → 3493.48] Right?
[3493.48 → 3494.48] Our circumstances may not change
[3495.48 → 3496.48] Right?
[3496.48 → 3497.48] In this text
[3497.48 → 3498.48] In this time
[3498.48 → 3499.48] Rome still rules
[3500.48 → 3501.48] Herod still rages
[3501.48 → 3503.48] Because life is still fragile
[3504.48 → 3506.48] Most of us are still waiting for something
[3507.48 → 3510.48] But you change
[3511.48 → 3512.48] Because God is now with you
[3513.48 → 3515.48] Your expectations change
[3516.48 → 3517.48] Because God has come
[3518.48 → 3519.48] And so you can face suffering
[3520.48 → 3521.48] Knowing that God has entered into it
[3522.48 → 3523.48] You can endure waiting
[3523.48 → 3524.48] Knowing that God honours it
[3525.48 → 3527.48] You can obey knowing that God has done it
[3527.48 → 3533.48] You can worship knowing that heaven and earth have met in Christ Jesus
[3534.48 → 3537.48] The Christian life is not a promise of a different world
[3538.48 → 3540.48] At least not a promise of a different world right now
[3541.48 → 3542.48] Not yet
[3543.48 → 3547.48] But it is a promise of a different way of being in the world right now
[3548.48 → 3552.48] Because the son has taken on our flesh and made it his home
[3552.48 → 3554.48] This Christmas
[3555.48 → 3557.48] And this is Christmas
[3558.48 → 3559.48] God is not far away
[3560.48 → 3561.48] This is not God waiting to be found
[3562.48 → 3564.48] But God dwelling with us
[3565.48 → 3568.48] The word became flesh and made his dwelling among us
[3569.48 → 3570.48] And so this Christmas
[3571.48 → 3574.48] Have your expectations reshaped
[3575.48 → 3576.48] And then go
[3577.48 → 3579.48] Be the unexpected presence of God
[3579.48 → 3580.48] In your homes
[3580.48 → 3581.48] In your homes
[3581.48 → 3582.48] And in your families
[3582.48 → 3583.48] In your workplaces
[3583.48 → 3584.48] In your schools
[3584.48 → 3585.48] On your sports teams
[3586.48 → 3587.48] And in your knitting clubs
[3588.48 → 3589.48] Right?
[3589.48 → 3590.48] People who don't know Jesus
[3591.48 → 3594.48] Expect his followers to be a certain way in the world
[3595.48 → 3597.48] And so surprise them
[3598.48 → 3599.48] With your gentleness
[3600.48 → 3601.48] And respect
[3602.48 → 3604.48] Surprise them
[3605.48 → 3606.48] With your reasonableness
[3606.48 → 3607.48] And your empathy
[3607.48 → 3608.48] Right?
[3608.48 → 3610.48] The world expects a particular kind of person
[3610.48 → 3612.48] To come out of church on Sunday morning
[3613.48 → 3614.48] Surprise them
[3615.48 → 3616.48] With your generosity
[3617.48 → 3618.48] And with your humility
[3619.48 → 3622.48] Jesus is who your heart aches for
[3623.48 → 3624.48] And in his heart
[3625.48 → 3627.48] He desires for you to come near
[3628.48 → 3629.48] So much so
[3630.48 → 3631.48] That he came to us
[3632.48 → 3634.48] And so if you're still waiting
[3634.48 → 3635.48] This Christmas
[3635.48 → 3637.48] Know that you're not left behind
[3638.48 → 3639.48] If you're still weary
[3640.48 → 3641.48] Still uncertain
[3641.48 → 3642.48] Still longing
[3643.48 → 3644.48] You are not failing
[3645.48 → 3647.48] The good news of Christmas
[3648.48 → 3649.48] Is not that your life
[3649.48 → 3650.48] Has finally come together
[3651.48 → 3652.48] But that God has come near
[3653.48 → 3654.48] Right?
[3654.48 → 3655.48] The waiting doesn't disqualify you
[3656.48 → 3657.48] The longing in your heart
[3657.48 → 3658.48] Doesn't surprise him
[3659.48 → 3660.48] The mess of your life
[3660.48 → 3661.48] Doesn't repel him
[3661.48 → 3663.48] This is the God
[3663.48 → 3664.48] Who dwells
[3664.48 → 3665.48] Among us
[3665.48 → 3666.48] This is the word
[3666.48 → 3667.48] Who became flesh
[3667.48 → 3668.48] This is Jesus
[3669.48 → 3670.48] Humble and gentle
[3671.48 → 3672.48] In heart
[3672.48 → 3673.48] Who meets you
[3673.48 → 3674.48] Not on the other side
[3674.48 → 3675.48] Of your circumstances
[3675.48 → 3676.48] But right here
[3677.48 → 3678.48] Right now
[3679.48 → 3680.48] And he is enough
[3682.48 → 3683.48] Enough to wait
[3684.48 → 3685.48] Enough to trust
[3686.48 → 3687.48] Enough to obey
[3687.48 → 3689.48] And enough to worship
[3690.48 → 3692.48] Because in Jesus Christ
[3693.48 → 3696.48] God is with us
[3697.48 → 3698.48] Amen
[3699.48 → 3700.48] Let's pray together
[3706.48 → 3707.48] Lord Jesus
[3708.48 → 3712.48] Open the eyes of our heart
[3713.48 → 3715.48] That we might see you
[3715.48 → 3716.48] This morning
[3716.48 → 3718.48] Open the eyes of our heart
[3718.48 → 3720.48] That we might know you
[3720.48 → 3721.48] This morning
[3722.48 → 3726.48] May we hear your voice
[3727.48 → 3729.48] And go transformed
[3730.48 → 3731.48] Into whatever today
[3732.48 → 3733.48] And tomorrow
[3733.48 → 3734.48] And the next day
[3734.48 → 3735.48] And the week to come
[3736.48 → 3737.48] May we go
[3738.48 → 3740.48] Declaring your presence
[3740.48 → 3742.48] May we come
[3742.48 → 3743.48] May we come
[3743.48 → 3744.48] May we come as a people
[3745.48 → 3746.48] Who have met you
[3747.48 → 3748.48] In our mess
[3750.48 → 3751.48] And who are used by you
[3752.48 → 3753.48] To bring the hope
[3753.48 → 3754.48] Of the nations
[3754.48 → 3755.48] To the nations
[3756.48 → 3757.48] Who are used by you
[3757.48 → 3759.48] To reveal your kingdom come
[3759.48 → 3760.48] And your kingdom coming
[3761.48 → 3764.48] And so teach us your gentleness
[3764.48 → 3765.48] And respect
[3766.48 → 3767.48] Teach us your humility
[3768.48 → 3769.48] And empathy
[3770.48 → 3772.48] That we might surprise people
[3773.48 → 3774.48] With a hope
[3775.48 → 3776.48] That endures
[3777.48 → 3779.48] May this be our Christmas gift
[3780.48 → 3782.48] To a world crying out for you
[3783.48 → 3785.48] In Jesus name we pray
[3786.48 → 3787.48] Amen
[3788.48 → 3789.48] Amen
[3789.48 → 3790.48] Amen
[3819.48 → 3823.48] Come Thou long expected Jesus
[3824.48 → 3828.48] Born to set Thy people free
[3829.48 → 3834.48] From our fears and sins releases
[3835.48 → 3840.48] Let us find our rest in Thee
[3840.48 → 3843.48] Israel
[3843.48 → 3847.48] Israel strength and consolation
[3848.48 → 3852.48] Hope of all the earth Thou art
[3853.48 → 3858.48] Dear desire of every nation
[3859.48 → 3864.48] Joy of every longing heart
[3864.48 → 3867.48] Born Thy people to deliver
[3867.48 → 3876.48] Born a child and yet a king
[3877.48 → 3882.48] Born to reign in us forever
[3883.48 → 3888.48] Now Thy gracious kingdom bring
[3888.48 → 3894.48] By Thine own eternal spirit
[3895.48 → 3900.48] Rule in all our hearts alone
