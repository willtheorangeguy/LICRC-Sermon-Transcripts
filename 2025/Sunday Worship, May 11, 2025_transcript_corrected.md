[0.00 → 13.64] Here and now I'm in the fire and above my head
[13.64 → 22.74] Being held under the pressure, don't know what'll be left
[22.74 → 34.52] But it's here in the ashes, I'm finding treasures
[34.52 → 44.48] He's making diamonds, diamonds, making diamonds out of dust
[44.48 → 53.84] He is refining, and in his timing, he's making diamonds out of us
[53.84 → 59.38] I'll surrender to the power of being crushed by love
[59.38 → 68.48] Till the beauty that was hidden isn't covered up
[68.48 → 75.98] Oh, it's not what I hoped for
[75.98 → 80.22] It's something much better
[80.22 → 90.20] He's making diamonds, diamonds, making diamonds out of dust
[90.20 → 99.54] He is refining, and in his timing, he's making diamonds out of us
[99.54 → 106.20] Oh, the joy of the Lord, it will be my strength
[106.74 → 110.94] When the pressure is on, he's making diamonds
[110.94 → 115.94] Oh, the joy of the Lord, it will be my strength
[115.94 → 120.04] When the pressure is on, he's making diamonds
[120.04 → 125.04] Oh, the joy of the Lord, it will be my strength
[125.04 → 131.50] When the pressure is on, he's making, he's making, he's making diamonds
[131.50 → 133.76] Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
[133.76 → 138.14] Making us rise up from the dust
[138.14 → 147.34] He is refining, and in his timing, he's making diamonds out of dust
[147.34 → 151.80] Making diamonds out of dust
[151.80 → 181.78] I won't be afraid
[181.78 → 187.02] Oh, the joy of the Lord, you're seeing me
[187.02 → 189.06] Oh, the joy of the Lord, I am making diamonds
[189.06 → 196.94] I want you as you are, not as you ought to be
[196.94 → 201.90] Won't you lay down your guard and cut me
[201.90 → 207.36] The shame that grips you now is crippling
[207.36 → 213.20] It breaks my heart to see you suffering
[213.20 → 216.38] Because I am for you
[216.38 → 220.38] I'm not against you
[220.38 → 225.70] If you want to know how far my love can go
[225.70 → 229.28] Just how deep, just how wide
[229.28 → 233.16] If you want to see how much you mean to me
[233.16 → 236.96] Look at my hands, look at my side
[236.96 → 242.24] If you could count the times that say you are unforgiving
[242.24 → 245.60] It's more than the drops in the ocean
[245.60 → 257.30] Don't think you need to settle for a substitute
[257.30 → 262.80] When I'm the only love that changes you
[262.80 → 265.54] And I am for you
[266.96 → 269.52] I'm not against you
[269.52 → 273.12] I'm not against you
[273.12 → 277.12] I'm not against you
[277.12 → 282.40] If you want to know how far my love can go
[282.40 → 285.24] Just how deep, just how wide
[285.24 → 289.88] If you want to see how much you mean to me
[289.88 → 293.64] Look at my hands, look at my side
[293.64 → 298.92] If you could count the times that say you are unforgiving
[298.92 → 302.26] It's more than the drops in the ocean
[302.26 → 304.40] If you want to see how much I am about ten
[304.40 → 322.34] It's kind of like a trump
[322.34 → 352.32] I love you.
[352.34 → 355.18] The drops in the ocean.
[361.08 → 363.76] I am for you.
[364.66 → 367.80] I'm not against you.
[368.80 → 371.34] I am for you.
[372.78 → 375.56] I'm not against you.
[382.34 → 412.32] I'm not against you.
[412.32 → 442.30] I'm not against you.
[442.30 → 443.80] Live like you know.
[444.08 → 445.86] Live like you know.
[445.86 → 448.28] Live like you know.
[450.14 → 452.36] Live like you know.
[454.14 → 456.92] Live like you know.
[457.84 → 460.90] And live like you know you're valuable.
[461.22 → 465.34] Like you know the one that holds your soul.
[465.34 → 469.58] Cause mercy has called you by your name
[469.58 → 473.88] Don't be afraid to live in that grace
[473.88 → 476.84] Oh, I'm telling you something
[476.84 → 479.04] This God we believe in
[479.04 → 481.52] Yeah, He changed everything
[481.52 → 484.66] No more guilt, no more shame
[484.66 → 486.64] He took all that away
[486.64 → 489.84] Gave us a reason to sing
[489.84 → 493.02] So go ahead and live like you live
[493.02 → 497.70] It's okay to act like you've been set free
[497.70 → 501.08] Cause love has made you more than enough
[501.08 → 504.48] So go ahead and live like you live
[504.48 → 507.80] Good morning!
[510.14 → 512.60] Welcome to church.
[512.74 → 516.00] A special welcome if you are a guest among us today.
[516.44 → 521.92] And an extra special welcome if you are a mom among us today.
[521.92 → 524.36] Happy Mother's Day to you.
[524.72 → 526.28] Here in the church especially,
[526.58 → 530.02] we know that mothers come in all sorts of different roles
[530.02 → 530.90] and relationships
[530.90 → 533.30] and we're grateful for all of you
[533.30 → 536.50] and for the impact that you have on the lives
[536.50 → 539.28] of our families and our kids together.
[540.10 → 542.04] We're also mindful that on days like today
[542.04 → 547.38] mothers can be, and being a mom can be hard
[547.38 → 549.98] and we can be missing our moms
[549.98 → 552.14] we can be wishing we were moms
[552.14 → 557.12] and so there are lots of emotions in this space today.
[557.28 → 561.30] And so we want to just bring that all to our God in worship.
[561.70 → 563.84] Our God meets us in this place
[563.84 → 566.36] in just a moment He's going to welcome us
[566.36 → 568.10] and He's going to greet us together.
[568.68 → 572.36] Before that, we do have a couple of announcements to make
[572.36 → 576.00] and so just wanted to note for you
[576.00 → 579.82] that reactivate registration is open
[579.82 → 583.10] and so that's a youth conference that we host here
[583.10 → 586.60] and that takes place September 5 through 7.
[587.34 → 589.32] And so if you are in our youth program
[589.32 → 592.52] or you know someone who would like to come to this conference,
[592.52 → 594.50] you can send them the link to registration
[594.50 → 596.82] which is in the e-bulletin, goes out
[596.82 → 598.06] and you can find it online.
[598.06 → 603.24] As well, this week, Tuesday, Coffee Break,
[603.34 → 605.36] which is a women's Bible study ministry
[605.36 → 607.18] that meets here Tuesday mornings.
[607.70 → 609.94] They're having their year-end social
[609.94 → 612.98] and so if you would like to come
[612.98 → 614.64] and have some excellent food
[614.64 → 616.48] and some even better fellowship,
[616.70 → 618.40] there's an opportunity for you to do that
[618.40 → 620.28] one last time this year.
[621.06 → 626.06] And then lastly, we had originally scheduled
[626.06 → 631.24] HCBC and our adult Heidelberg Catechism reading group
[631.24 → 632.74] for next weekend,
[633.28 → 634.28] but it's a long weekend
[634.28 → 635.90] and we've heard feedback from people
[635.90 → 638.00] and so we're rescheduling that.
[638.46 → 640.22] That information will come out
[640.22 → 643.34] to those who participate in the next little while.
[643.48 → 645.66] So keep your eyes and ears open for that.
[646.60 → 648.72] I think that's it for our announcements
[648.72 → 649.92] and so I'm going to invite you
[649.92 → 652.86] as you're able and where you are to stand together.
[652.86 → 656.04] Together, we can be welcomed into the presence
[656.04 → 658.54] of our God and Father together.
[658.66 → 660.48] Following God's greeting,
[660.68 → 662.78] I invite you to turn to those around you
[662.78 → 665.54] and to welcome them into worship together.
[665.94 → 667.72] You can do so with a handshake,
[668.08 → 669.78] with a fist bump or a head nod
[669.78 → 671.86] and then pass the peace of Christ.
[672.04 → 673.96] Say the peace of Christ be with you
[673.96 → 675.34] or the Lord be with you
[675.34 → 677.04] as we come together this morning.
[677.16 → 678.48] Receive God's blessing.
[678.48 → 682.92] grace, mercy and peace to you
[682.92 → 684.06] from God our Father,
[684.34 → 685.66] from the Lord Jesus Christ,
[685.76 → 686.84] His Son and our Saviour,
[687.44 → 688.62] through the presence and power
[688.62 → 689.86] of the Holy Spirit.
[690.72 → 691.08] Amen.
[691.08 → 691.20] Amen.
[691.20 → 691.24] Amen.
[708.48 → 738.30] Our call to worship this morning
[738.30 → 740.22] comes from Psalm 62.
[740.22 → 744.82] Yes, my soul finds rest in God.
[745.48 → 747.34] My hope comes from Him.
[748.38 → 751.04] Truly, He is my rock and my salvation.
[751.66 → 752.94] He is my fortress.
[753.38 → 754.78] I will not be shaken.
[755.82 → 758.56] My salvation and my honour depend on God.
[758.72 → 761.64] He is my mighty rock, my refuge.
[762.72 → 765.12] Trust in Him at all times, you people.
[765.12 → 768.16] pour out your hearts to Him.
[768.16 → 770.32] For God is our refuge.
[771.38 → 773.62] Let's pour out our hearts to God this morning
[773.62 → 774.44] as we worship.
[775.00 → 777.90] May we rest in Him our hope and our refuge.
[777.90 → 798.58] Jesus, hope of the nations.
[799.58 → 802.94] Jesus, comfort for all who bore.
[802.94 → 803.94] Jesus, Lord.
[803.94 → 809.94] You are the source of heaven's hope on earth.
[809.94 → 813.94] Jesus, light in the darkness.
[813.94 → 818.26] Jesus, truth in the circumstance.
[818.26 → 825.26] You are the source of heaven's hope on earth.
[825.26 → 829.26] In history, you live and die.
[829.26 → 831.26] You broke the chains.
[831.26 → 833.26] You rose to life.
[833.26 → 838.16] You are the hope living in us.
[838.16 → 841.16] You are the rock in whom we trust.
[841.16 → 848.16] You are the light shining for all the world to see.
[849.16 → 853.16] Heroes from the dead, conquering fear.
[853.16 → 856.90] Our prince of peace drawing us here.
[857.42 → 862.16] Jesus, our hope living for all who will receive.
[862.16 → 864.16] Lord, we believe.
[864.16 → 866.16] Lord, we believe.
[874.16 → 877.16] Jesus, hope of the nations.
[877.16 → 882.16] Jesus, comfort for all who mourn.
[882.16 → 889.16] You are the source of heaven's hope on earth.
[889.16 → 892.16] Jesus, light in the darkness.
[893.16 → 897.16] Jesus, truth in the circumstance.
[897.16 → 903.16] You are the source of heaven's hope on earth.
[903.16 → 907.16] In history, you lived and died.
[907.16 → 909.16] You broke the chains.
[909.16 → 912.16] You rose to life.
[912.16 → 916.16] You are the hope living in us.
[916.16 → 920.16] You are the rock in whom we trust.
[920.16 → 927.16] You are the light shining for all the world to see.
[927.16 → 931.16] Heroes from the dead, conquering fear.
[931.16 → 935.16] Our prince of peace drawing us here.
[935.16 → 942.16] Jesus, our hope living for all who will receive.
[942.16 → 955.16] Lord, we believe.
[955.16 → 968.16] Lord, we believe.
[968.16 → 990.34] My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[990.34 → 1005.34] I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly trust in Jesus' name.
[1005.34 → 1019.10] My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[1019.10 → 1033.10] I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly trust in Jesus' name.
[1033.10 → 1048.46] Christ alone, cornerstone, weak made strong in the Saviour's love.
[1048.46 → 1057.64] Through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all.
[1063.10 → 1075.60] When darkness seems to hide His face, I rest on His unchanging grace.
[1075.60 → 1087.60] In every mind, stormy air, my anger holds within the air.
[1087.60 → 1094.82] My anger holds within the air.
[1096.20 → 1108.62] Christ alone, cornerstone, weak made strong in the Saviour's love.
[1108.62 → 1118.62] Through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all.
[1118.62 → 1134.62] When He shall come with trumpet sound, O may I then in Him be found.
[1134.62 → 1146.62] Dressed in His righteousness alone, fallen stand before the throne.
[1146.62 → 1160.62] Christ alone, cornerstone, weak made strong in the Saviour's love.
[1160.62 → 1172.62] Through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all.
[1172.62 → 1185.62] Christ alone, cornerstone, weak made strong in the Saviour's love.
[1185.62 → 1197.62] Through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all.
[1200.62 → 1202.22] I invite you to be seated.
[1208.12 → 1210.66] So I was looking this week at Psalm 91.
[1211.22 → 1213.18] It's a pretty well-known psalm.
[1213.18 → 1215.34] The first couple of verses says,
[1215.34 → 1220.32] Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.
[1220.94 → 1225.82] I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress, my God in whom I trust.
[1226.48 → 1228.42] And so there are a couple of words that caught my eye.
[1229.68 → 1232.78] Rest and trust were the two words.
[1233.26 → 1236.04] And it reminded me of a picture I had in a...
[1236.04 → 1238.66] There was a sermon we were listening to a while back.
[1238.66 → 1239.66] And it was...
[1239.66 → 1243.62] The illustration was of a child resting in his mother's arms.
[1244.50 → 1245.76] And it was just resting.
[1246.56 → 1254.14] It looked to me like there is no rest if that child has no trust.
[1254.14 → 1262.94] And so I was thinking, the quality of our rest speaks of the trust we have in our Heavenly Father.
[1264.54 → 1275.44] And it got me asking myself, what do I have to let go of in order for myself to be able to kind of lay back and rest like that child in my Father's arms?
[1275.44 → 1279.02] So let's invite you to pray with me.
[1281.26 → 1286.56] Abba Father, life has so many concerns, so many distractions.
[1286.56 → 1294.36] It's so easy for us to trust in our own abilities and to tell ourselves, just work harder.
[1295.66 → 1298.22] Forgive us for trying to live life on our own.
[1298.96 → 1305.98] For forgetting your promise that whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.
[1305.98 → 1315.62] Will you, by your Holy Spirit, help us to trust as we find shelter and learn to rest in your arms?
[1316.54 → 1316.78] Amen.
[1318.46 → 1321.06] Why don't we continue worship with...
[1321.06 → 1322.66] Just rise and sing with us.
[1322.66 → 1323.66] Amen.
[1335.98 → 1351.76] You are my strength when I am weak.
[1351.76 → 1355.40] You are the treasure that I seek.
[1355.80 → 1361.14] You are my all in all.
[1361.14 → 1366.14] Seeking you as a precious jewel.
[1366.14 → 1369.62] For to give up I be a fool.
[1369.62 → 1375.36] You are my all in all.
[1375.36 → 1383.30] Jesus, Lamb of God.
[1383.30 → 1387.98] Worthy is your name.
[1387.98 → 1396.46] Jesus, Lamb of God.
[1396.46 → 1403.46] Worthy is your name.
[1403.46 → 1408.46] Jesus, Lamb of God.
[1408.46 → 1411.46] Worthy is your name.
[1411.46 → 1416.46] You are my all in all.
[1416.46 → 1418.46] You are my all in all.
[1418.46 → 1422.34] When I fall down, you take me up.
[1422.34 → 1425.68] When I am dry, you fill my cup.
[1425.68 → 1430.46] You are my all in all.
[1430.46 → 1433.94] Jesus, Lamb of God.
[1433.94 → 1434.94] Thank you.
[1434.94 → 1438.96] Jesus, Lamb of God.
[1438.96 → 1440.12] Worthy is your name.
[1440.12 → 1442.78] Jesus, Lamb of God.
[1442.78 → 1444.12] You are my all in all.
[1444.12 → 1444.82] Jesus, Lamb of God.
[1444.82 → 1447.08] You are my all in all.
[1447.08 → 1449.30] When I fall down, you pick me up.
[1449.30 → 1451.16] When I am dry, you fill my cup.
[1451.16 → 1456.16] You are my all in all.
[1456.16 → 1473.92] Jesus, Lamb of God, worthy is your name.
[1473.92 → 1488.36] Jesus, Lamb of God, worthy is your name.
[1503.92 → 1520.36] My Jesus, I love thee, I know thou art mine.
[1520.36 → 1530.36] For thee all the fall is the sin I resign.
[1530.36 → 1540.36] My precious Redeemer, my Saviour art thou.
[1541.96 → 1551.36] If ever I love thee, my Jesus is now.
[1551.36 → 1562.96] I love thee because thou hast first loved me.
[1563.56 → 1572.96] And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree.
[1572.96 → 1583.96] I love thee for wearing the thorns on thy brow.
[1585.06 → 1594.56] If ever I love thee, my Jesus is now.
[1594.56 → 1606.96] I love thee in life, I will love thee in death.
[1607.42 → 1617.16] And praise thee as long as thou lewdest me breath.
[1617.16 → 1629.46] And sin when the death dew lies cold on my brow.
[1629.46 → 1640.74] If ever I love thee, my Jesus is now.
[1640.74 → 1651.74] In mansions of glory and endless delight.
[1651.74 → 1663.74] I'll ever adore thee in heaven so bright.
[1663.74 → 1674.74] I'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow.
[1674.74 → 1686.74] If ever I love thee, my Jesus is now.
[1686.74 → 1689.14] I invite you to be seated.
[1689.14 → 1699.36] Good morning.
[1699.36 → 1699.38] Good morning.
[1699.38 → 1702.34] My name is Mike and I serve as a deacon here for the church family.
[1702.34 → 1707.10] And this morning we have a special offering for the Dracula Ministries of Canada.
[1707.10 → 1713.98] So they are a wonderful agency that works with the CRC and churches across Canada to empower deacons,
[1713.98 → 1719.98] and leaders in the church, any of us in the church to be able to work in their communities,
[1719.98 → 1724.98] and empower others, and have compassionate ministries be vibrant and actually helpful.
[1724.98 → 1729.98] So they work with a lot of churches, but they also work with other smaller organizations that are getting going,
[1729.98 → 1732.98] getting off the ground, and they've been a huge blessing to this church.
[1732.98 → 1739.98] I think our church has actually quite a long history serving alongside them, and resourcing them, and also blessing them.
[1739.98 → 1744.98] So thank you in advance for blessing the DMC this morning.
[1744.98 → 1752.98] So any of the undesignated gifts that are put in these baskets, or in these little baggies, are for the DMC.
[1752.98 → 1757.98] And if you want to give to the budget or anything else, please make sure that is specifically designated in envelope,
[1757.98 → 1760.98] or on the check, or however you choose to give.
[1760.98 → 1765.98] All the nine spaces, can you search for a descriptive word of help,
[1765.98 → 1771.98] and there are great connections toward stranger singer artindooms.
[1771.98 → 1777.98] Satan speaking
[1777.98 → 1787.98] No place I'd rather be
[1787.98 → 1791.98] Than here in your love
[1791.98 → 1801.98] No place I'd rather be
[1801.98 → 1805.98] Than here in your love
[1805.98 → 1815.98] I want more of you, God
[1815.98 → 1819.98] To set a fire down in my soul
[1819.98 → 1825.98] That I can't contain, and I can't control
[1825.98 → 1829.98] I want more of you, God
[1829.98 → 1835.80] I want more of you God. I want more of you God.
[1842.24 → 1856.80] No place I would rather be. No place I would rather be. No place I'd rather be than here in your love. Here in your love.
[1856.80 → 1871.98] No place I would rather be. No place I would rather be. No place I would rather be than here in your love. Here in your love.
[1871.98 → 1878.98] So set a fire down in my soul that I can't contain, that I can't control.
[1879.60 → 1886.12] I want more of you God. I want more of you God.
[1886.12 → 1893.58] So set a fire down in my soul that I can't contain, that I can't control.
[1894.14 → 1900.54] I want more of you God. I want more of you God.
[1900.54 → 1930.52] I want more of you God.
[1930.52 → 1934.12] So that's preschool through grade four.
[1935.08 → 1937.80] If you're here, come on up to the front.
[1939.10 → 1942.00] Awesome. Thank you.
[1944.18 → 1944.62] Beautiful.
[1947.28 → 1947.72] Excellent.
[1948.52 → 1949.16] All right, guys.
[1949.86 → 1953.56] It has fallen to me this morning to lead you, but I forget how we do it.
[1953.56 → 1957.32] So when you guys come up to the front, what do we do?
[1959.56 → 1959.92] Anyone?
[1961.26 → 1963.10] Someone help me? Everly, do you know?
[1963.92 → 1964.14] No?
[1965.64 → 1966.00] Hmm.
[1966.78 → 1967.96] Ty, I said, what about you? You know.
[1968.50 → 1969.46] You don't know either?
[1969.58 → 1970.40] I don't believe you.
[1971.12 → 1972.02] I was supposed to tell a story.
[1972.44 → 1973.68] I was supposed to tell a story?
[1974.40 → 1975.04] Oh, no.
[1976.72 → 1978.00] I was supposed to have a puppet.
[1978.36 → 1978.86] Oh, yeah.
[1981.22 → 1985.86] Unfortunately, I don't have the capacity for peppering and talking out of that side of my mouth.
[1987.80 → 1991.16] I think we do something like pray.
[1991.16 → 1991.56] Pray.
[1992.26 → 1992.66] Yeah?
[1993.32 → 1993.96] We pray.
[1994.16 → 1994.74] Okay, good.
[1994.84 → 1995.34] We got one.
[1995.84 → 1996.54] And then what else?
[1997.10 → 1998.20] We stand, right?
[1998.60 → 1999.50] What do we stand for?
[2001.04 → 2001.90] Stand for praying?
[2002.06 → 2002.32] All right.
[2002.34 → 2002.78] I love it.
[2003.42 → 2004.62] We're going to stand to pray.
[2004.94 → 2006.82] And then we say a blessing, right?
[2007.84 → 2009.22] What does that mean?
[2009.80 → 2014.66] When you say, the Lord be with you, what do you think that means?
[2017.24 → 2020.08] Does that maybe mean that God is with you?
[2021.10 → 2021.54] Yeah.
[2022.20 → 2023.48] That's exactly what that means.
[2023.48 → 2026.18] And then they say, and also with you.
[2026.56 → 2030.36] And that means that God is here among us, and we're in his presence together.
[2031.36 → 2032.90] That is pretty cool.
[2033.00 → 2037.90] That's one of the amazing things about our church family coming together to worship,
[2037.90 → 2039.66] is that God actually shows up.
[2040.46 → 2045.40] You actually get to hear him and meet him and be present with him through all these awesome people.
[2046.02 → 2047.80] So, we're going to follow the lead.
[2047.86 → 2049.64] We're going to stand and pray together.
[2050.26 → 2051.98] And then we're going to do the blessing, all right?
[2052.18 → 2054.94] Congregation, you're also going to stand and pray with us.
[2056.22 → 2060.76] Did you know that in church history, there was three or four postures for praying?
[2061.50 → 2063.72] None of them were sitting in a comfortable seat.
[2064.42 → 2067.62] They were standing or kneeling or laying prostrate.
[2067.90 → 2068.76] Before the Lord.
[2068.96 → 2071.38] And so, let's stand and pray together.
[2071.46 → 2072.38] Let's pray, all right, guys?
[2073.28 → 2079.94] Dear Jesus, we love you, and we are so glad that you are here with us in worship.
[2079.94 → 2085.86] As these kids go to learn more about you, may you speak to their hearts.
[2086.70 → 2091.42] And as we remain here together, may you also speak to our hearts.
[2091.42 → 2098.50] And as we all together as church family prepare to come to the table, may you fill our hearts.
[2099.18 → 2100.46] In Jesus' name we pray.
[2101.54 → 2101.94] Amen.
[2102.46 → 2103.10] Good work.
[2103.16 → 2104.48] All right, let's hold our hands up.
[2104.90 → 2106.78] And we're going to say, the Lord be with you.
[2106.84 → 2109.78] And then everyone else is going to respond by saying, and also with you.
[2109.88 → 2110.08] Ready?
[2110.28 → 2111.58] One, two, three.
[2111.96 → 2113.82] The Lord be with you.
[2114.20 → 2115.70] And also with you.
[2115.84 → 2116.32] Amen.
[2116.32 → 2116.54] Amen.
[2139.72 → 2142.92] My name is Paul, and I'm an elder here at this church.
[2142.92 → 2147.10] And I'd like to lead you in our family prayer.
[2147.56 → 2155.30] But before I do that, a bit of an update from the council, the leadership board of this church.
[2155.62 → 2161.44] We met this past Tuesday, and a few things happened there.
[2161.44 → 2174.26] We reviewed the 2024 financial statements and approved them for presentation at our spring general meeting coming up.
[2175.48 → 2180.26] That'll be on May the 17th, I believe.
[2181.34 → 2184.44] So 22nd, sorry, 22nd.
[2184.44 → 2188.84] 22nd, so hold a place on your calendar for that, please.
[2191.12 → 2202.64] After reviewing the financial statements, we had a surplus over expenses this past year.
[2202.64 → 2210.88] So we had a prayer of thanksgiving for that, how God has blessed this church family.
[2210.88 → 2224.38] So that pending the approval of those financial statements, we're going to decide what we're going to do with that surplus.
[2225.44 → 2232.78] We approved the agenda and plan for hosting the spring general meeting, which is on May the 22nd.
[2232.78 → 2239.54] And we reviewed also the report from the town hall.
[2239.92 → 2252.72] Hope that all you, everybody who got those, the link for that is in the bulletin for the email that you got for the meeting coming up.
[2254.06 → 2256.24] Encourage everyone to read that.
[2256.24 → 2265.46] And then we also approved the slate of nominees for Deacon and Elder.
[2267.02 → 2275.90] And while I call out those names, they're up there on the screen for you to see because we didn't know for sure who would all be here.
[2277.38 → 2281.90] For Deacon, it's Pete Birken pass, Carolyn Spoor, and Warren for Hoof.
[2281.90 → 2293.04] And for Elder, it's also Pete Birken pass, Jesus Hernandez, PIM School, Frank Welding, and Sam Wind.
[2293.04 → 2303.54] And Dick Lingering and Brenda Alchemy also agreed to extend their term for one year.
[2304.00 → 2311.62] That's so that we get a bit more of a balance on how we call out or have to nominate names for.
[2311.62 → 2319.82] We also received some reports from Pastor Chris and Pastor Kevin.
[2324.82 → 2326.92] Let's go to our God in prayer.
[2326.92 → 2343.52] Father in heaven, holy, holy, holy are you, Lord God Almighty,
[2344.22 → 2350.32] who was and is and is to come with all creation.
[2350.84 → 2353.50] We sing praise to you, the King of kings.
[2353.50 → 2359.46] You are worthy to receive glory and honour and power.
[2361.00 → 2367.56] You are everything to all, a wonderful mystery, and we adore you.
[2370.56 → 2373.50] We give you thanks that you have given us your Son,
[2374.86 → 2377.54] that we have the grace to stand before you.
[2377.54 → 2382.68] Lord, we are incapable of changing ourselves,
[2383.08 → 2387.44] but by your Spirit, work in us to make us like your Son.
[2389.30 → 2391.28] Thank you for your mercy and grace,
[2392.08 → 2394.24] for always being there when we need you.
[2396.44 → 2399.94] When days are long and our hearts are troubled,
[2400.94 → 2403.30] you are always there to walk beside us.
[2403.30 → 2409.14] We've all come with individual and personal needs,
[2409.68 → 2413.26] needs that we may not have shared with anyone else,
[2414.26 → 2419.02] but you know us and the struggles and burdens we are facing.
[2421.48 → 2424.00] Lord, we thank you for mothers this day
[2424.00 → 2428.18] and for those that fill in as mothers.
[2430.58 → 2432.50] They are all so much for us.
[2435.46 → 2437.16] We thank you for new life,
[2440.16 → 2443.66] for babies that have come into families.
[2443.66 → 2448.66] We pray that you give us grace and strength
[2448.66 → 2453.28] to raise these children up to follow you.
[2455.52 → 2458.46] We pray for those that also find this day difficult
[2458.46 → 2462.46] because of loss or strained relationships
[2462.46 → 2465.50] or unfulfilled longing for motherhood.
[2467.80 → 2470.54] We ask for the grace and the comfort
[2470.54 → 2471.78] that only you can provide.
[2471.78 → 2476.84] We pray for the Skipper family.
[2477.98 → 2480.00] We ask that you give comfort and strength
[2480.00 → 2481.26] to Matt and his children
[2481.26 → 2484.72] and that you will be with the whole family
[2484.72 → 2487.16] as they grief the loss of Rachel.
[2490.00 → 2492.36] We ask that you will continue to be with those
[2492.36 → 2493.56] who suffer from cancer.
[2495.36 → 2496.52] We think of Tanya,
[2498.00 → 2498.46] Tessa,
[2499.06 → 2499.56] and Doug.
[2499.56 → 2502.58] We pray that you will walk beside them
[2502.58 → 2503.60] and their families
[2503.60 → 2505.70] as they make their individual journeys.
[2509.04 → 2510.98] Lord, we ask that you will continue
[2510.98 → 2513.82] to help this church gather in your name
[2513.82 → 2516.72] to grow in the knowledge
[2516.72 → 2517.92] that you are with us
[2517.92 → 2519.52] and saved us from our sins.
[2521.24 → 2522.40] Help us to go
[2522.40 → 2525.22] out into the surrounding community
[2525.22 → 2526.48] and share your love.
[2529.48 → 2530.80] We pray hear us.
[2533.44 → 2535.32] Look at the list of our concerns.
[2536.34 → 2537.56] We know that you knew it
[2537.56 → 2538.80] before we wrote it down.
[2540.38 → 2542.28] And we know you better than us
[2542.28 → 2543.44] that we...
[2543.44 → 2546.06] what must be prayed
[2546.06 → 2548.66] in each of these circumstances.
[2550.22 → 2551.96] We ask that your Holy Spirit
[2551.96 → 2553.34] completes that for us.
[2555.86 → 2558.10] As we hear your word for us this morning,
[2558.26 → 2559.52] preached by Pastor Chris,
[2560.46 → 2563.36] fill our hearts with your will and purposes
[2563.36 → 2564.70] by your Holy Spirit
[2564.70 → 2568.46] so that your kingdom will advance through us.
[2568.46 → 2570.18] your Holy Name
[2570.18 → 2571.38] will be glorified
[2571.38 → 2574.58] and the story of your great name
[2574.58 → 2576.28] is spread through us.
[2577.74 → 2579.84] The story of amazing love,
[2580.72 → 2581.88] the light of the world
[2581.88 → 2582.90] given for us.
[2585.38 → 2586.82] Father, we pray that our eyes
[2586.82 → 2588.04] would be fixed on Jesus.
[2588.56 → 2589.80] We pray that by your Spirit
[2589.80 → 2591.36] you might bring it into our hearts
[2591.36 → 2591.94] to believe
[2591.94 → 2593.48] and to trust in you.
[2594.32 → 2595.66] For all these things we pray
[2595.66 → 2597.02] because of your Holy Name.
[2597.98 → 2598.26] Amen.
[2598.46 → 2598.96] Amen.
[2620.30 → 2623.64] This morning we will continue
[2623.64 → 2624.64] in our series
[2624.64 → 2626.42] through Thessalonians
[2626.42 → 2628.24] although we're making a bit
[2628.24 → 2628.86] of a shift
[2628.86 → 2630.38] in that we're starting
[2630.38 → 2631.60] the second letter
[2631.60 → 2632.92] to the Thessalonians
[2632.92 → 2634.32] and so we're going to
[2634.32 → 2635.62] in just a moment
[2635.62 → 2636.66] read together
[2636.66 → 2639.48] from 2 Thessalonians
[2639.48 → 2641.38] 1 through
[2641.38 → 2642.58] chapter 1
[2642.58 → 2643.38] verse 1
[2643.38 → 2645.40] through the first part
[2645.40 → 2646.02] of verse 7.
[2646.74 → 2647.64] I encourage you to
[2647.64 → 2648.70] have that open
[2648.70 → 2649.26] in front of you
[2649.26 → 2650.22] whether on a device
[2650.22 → 2651.12] or in a Bible
[2651.12 → 2652.18] if you would like to hang on
[2652.18 → 2652.68] to a Bible
[2652.68 → 2653.42] but don't have one
[2653.42 → 2654.00] there's a couple
[2654.00 → 2655.66] a few at the back there
[2655.66 → 2656.10] you're welcome
[2656.10 → 2656.76] to grab one
[2656.76 → 2657.20] from there
[2657.20 → 2658.66] open it up
[2658.66 → 2659.36] the first time
[2659.36 → 2659.98] we go through
[2659.98 → 2661.42] it will be on the screen
[2661.42 → 2662.38] behind me
[2662.38 → 2664.96] let's read God's Word
[2664.96 → 2665.60] together
[2665.60 → 2669.14] Paul
[2669.14 → 2670.02] Silas
[2670.02 → 2670.82] and Timothy
[2670.82 → 2672.40] to the church
[2672.40 → 2673.64] of the Thessalonians
[2673.64 → 2674.48] in God
[2674.48 → 2675.38] our Father
[2675.38 → 2676.26] and the Lord
[2676.26 → 2677.16] Jesus Christ
[2677.16 → 2679.34] grace and peace
[2679.34 → 2679.88] to you
[2679.88 → 2680.54] from God
[2680.54 → 2681.06] the Father
[2681.06 → 2681.82] and the Lord
[2681.82 → 2682.66] Jesus Christ
[2682.66 → 2684.72] we ought always
[2684.72 → 2685.92] to thank God
[2685.92 → 2686.38] for you
[2686.38 → 2687.48] brothers and sisters
[2687.48 → 2689.40] and rightly so
[2689.40 → 2690.36] because your faith
[2690.36 → 2690.96] is growing
[2690.96 → 2692.14] more and more
[2692.14 → 2693.14] and the love
[2693.14 → 2694.16] all of you have
[2694.16 → 2694.84] for one another
[2694.84 → 2695.64] is increasing
[2695.64 → 2697.20] therefore
[2697.20 → 2698.94] among God's churches
[2698.94 → 2699.96] we boast
[2699.96 → 2701.48] about your perseverance
[2701.48 → 2702.64] and faith
[2702.64 → 2704.10] in all the persecutions
[2704.10 → 2704.78] and trials
[2704.78 → 2705.92] you are enduring
[2705.92 → 2708.16] all this
[2708.16 → 2708.98] is evidence
[2708.98 → 2710.50] that God's judgment
[2710.50 → 2711.56] is right
[2711.56 → 2713.18] and as a result
[2713.18 → 2714.38] you will be counted
[2714.38 → 2715.68] worthy of the kingdom
[2715.68 → 2716.28] of God
[2716.28 → 2718.02] for which you are suffering
[2718.02 → 2720.58] God is just
[2720.58 → 2722.44] he will pay back
[2722.44 → 2723.80] to those who trouble you
[2723.80 → 2725.00] and give relief
[2725.00 → 2725.60] to you
[2725.60 → 2726.44] who are troubled
[2726.44 → 2728.16] and to us
[2728.16 → 2729.36] as well
[2729.36 → 2731.14] this is the word
[2731.14 → 2731.58] of the Lord
[2731.58 → 2738.00] now I want to begin
[2738.00 → 2738.56] this morning
[2738.56 → 2740.64] by saying something
[2740.64 → 2741.60] that shouldn't
[2741.60 → 2742.28] be controversial
[2742.28 → 2743.40] in a church
[2743.40 → 2745.78] and yet is controversial
[2745.78 → 2747.16] to people
[2747.16 → 2748.50] outside a church
[2748.50 → 2750.86] and in fact
[2750.86 → 2752.14] may be
[2752.14 → 2753.50] functionally
[2753.50 → 2754.60] controversial
[2754.60 → 2755.94] in your own life
[2755.94 → 2757.40] you ready
[2757.40 → 2760.20] God
[2760.20 → 2761.38] is
[2761.38 → 2762.48] real
[2762.48 → 2766.46] God
[2766.46 → 2767.36] is
[2767.36 → 2768.22] active
[2768.22 → 2770.32] in this world
[2770.32 → 2773.54] and God
[2773.54 → 2774.52] is active
[2774.52 → 2775.66] in
[2775.66 → 2776.56] your
[2776.56 → 2777.54] life
[2777.54 → 2779.52] now like we said
[2779.52 → 2780.06] that shouldn't be
[2780.06 → 2780.92] controversial here
[2780.92 → 2782.04] four of you
[2782.04 → 2782.96] should have said amen
[2782.96 → 2783.80] by now
[2783.80 → 2786.36] okay three of you
[2786.36 → 2786.66] tried
[2786.66 → 2787.14] good work
[2787.14 → 2790.02] but it is
[2790.02 → 2790.50] controversial
[2790.50 → 2791.26] in a world
[2791.26 → 2792.06] that doesn't believe
[2792.06 → 2792.56] in God
[2792.56 → 2793.86] or that doesn't believe
[2793.86 → 2794.36] in the God
[2794.36 → 2794.88] of the Bible
[2794.88 → 2795.58] that refuses
[2795.58 → 2797.30] to believe in God
[2797.30 → 2798.56] and maybe
[2798.56 → 2800.56] it's convicting
[2800.56 → 2802.14] to your life
[2802.14 → 2803.58] that professes
[2803.58 → 2804.26] with your lips
[2804.26 → 2805.22] that God is real
[2805.22 → 2807.02] but then lives
[2807.02 → 2808.06] in fear
[2808.06 → 2809.22] and without trust
[2809.22 → 2809.82] day in
[2809.82 → 2810.42] and day out
[2810.42 → 2811.28] like he's not
[2811.28 → 2813.74] like he isn't
[2813.74 → 2814.12] walking
[2814.12 → 2815.26] with you
[2815.26 → 2815.92] and preparing
[2815.92 → 2816.88] a way for you
[2816.88 → 2817.58] like he isn't
[2817.58 → 2817.92] guiding
[2817.92 → 2818.62] and sustaining
[2818.62 → 2819.66] and upholding
[2819.66 → 2820.14] you
[2820.14 → 2820.82] like he isn't
[2820.82 → 2821.30] giving you
[2821.30 → 2823.56] everything you need
[2823.56 → 2824.14] for faith
[2824.14 → 2825.22] and godliness
[2825.22 → 2826.18] like he hasn't
[2826.18 → 2827.22] prepared a way
[2827.22 → 2827.80] for you
[2827.80 → 2830.34] God
[2830.34 → 2831.40] is
[2831.40 → 2832.38] real
[2832.38 → 2833.18] and he
[2833.18 → 2834.48] is at work
[2834.48 → 2835.20] in
[2835.20 → 2836.12] the world
[2836.12 → 2838.16] and the way
[2838.16 → 2838.90] we see God
[2838.90 → 2839.38] at work
[2839.38 → 2840.30] in the world
[2840.30 → 2841.24] primarily
[2841.24 → 2842.36] not the only way
[2842.36 → 2843.14] but primarily
[2843.14 → 2844.32] first
[2844.32 → 2846.70] is through his church
[2846.70 → 2849.32] is through his people
[2849.32 → 2851.34] through you
[2851.34 → 2852.64] and me
[2852.64 → 2854.06] however humbly
[2854.06 → 2855.10] and feebly
[2855.10 → 2856.22] we try
[2856.22 → 2857.50] the reality
[2857.50 → 2858.46] is
[2858.46 → 2859.90] the amazing
[2859.90 → 2860.98] power of God
[2860.98 → 2861.82] is made known
[2861.82 → 2862.54] to the world
[2862.54 → 2864.20] through the church
[2864.20 → 2866.16] and so
[2866.16 → 2866.60] reading
[2866.60 → 2867.24] Paul
[2867.24 → 2867.88] today
[2867.88 → 2869.48] our big idea
[2869.48 → 2870.24] our theme
[2870.24 → 2871.12] to explore
[2871.12 → 2872.10] is that
[2872.10 → 2872.78] a church
[2872.78 → 2874.34] grounded in faith
[2874.34 → 2875.70] will be fruitful
[2875.70 → 2877.24] in its work
[2877.24 → 2879.14] and then the
[2879.14 → 2880.44] parenthetic remark
[2880.44 → 2881.00] behind that
[2881.00 → 2881.38] because
[2881.38 → 2882.66] God is real
[2882.66 → 2884.38] because
[2884.38 → 2886.04] God is at work
[2886.04 → 2888.62] now we started
[2888.62 → 2889.54] in this letter
[2889.54 → 2891.12] the way
[2891.12 → 2892.48] all ancient letters
[2892.48 → 2893.22] started
[2893.22 → 2894.72] with the names
[2894.72 → 2895.56] of the author
[2895.56 → 2896.92] the one
[2896.92 → 2897.94] whose names
[2897.94 → 2898.98] and authorities
[2898.98 → 2900.14] stand behind
[2900.14 → 2900.96] the content
[2900.96 → 2902.28] so we read
[2902.28 → 2902.80] Paul
[2902.80 → 2903.66] Silas
[2903.66 → 2904.70] and Timothy
[2904.70 → 2907.16] now just a quick
[2907.16 → 2907.68] reminder
[2907.68 → 2908.24] Paul
[2908.24 → 2908.78] Silas
[2908.78 → 2909.36] and Timothy
[2909.36 → 2910.92] are missionaries
[2910.92 → 2913.04] to the church
[2913.04 → 2914.16] in Thessalonica
[2914.16 → 2915.58] which is in
[2915.58 → 2916.46] modern day Greece
[2916.46 → 2917.42] we have a map
[2917.42 → 2918.30] just to remind us
[2918.30 → 2918.90] where we're at
[2918.90 → 2921.04] and after preaching
[2921.04 → 2921.84] and teaching
[2921.84 → 2923.56] for three weeks
[2923.56 → 2924.20] there
[2924.20 → 2925.80] they had to flee
[2925.80 → 2927.44] because of
[2927.44 → 2928.16] persecution
[2928.16 → 2929.24] and trouble
[2929.24 → 2930.00] with the local
[2930.00 → 2930.60] authorities
[2930.60 → 2932.84] and for a brief
[2932.84 → 2933.32] time
[2933.32 → 2933.80] Paul
[2933.80 → 2934.66] and then Silas
[2934.66 → 2935.16] and Timothy
[2935.16 → 2936.14] had to separate
[2936.14 → 2937.36] and Paul
[2937.36 → 2938.02] made his way
[2938.02 → 2938.84] down to Corinth
[2938.84 → 2940.28] and eventually
[2940.28 → 2941.34] Silas and Timothy
[2941.34 → 2942.46] rejoin him
[2942.46 → 2943.52] and when they do
[2943.52 → 2944.86] they bring an update
[2944.86 → 2946.22] of what was happening
[2946.22 → 2947.46] back in Thessalonica
[2947.46 → 2948.70] and that's what
[2948.70 → 2949.48] causes Paul
[2949.48 → 2950.56] to write his first
[2950.56 → 2951.28] letter to them
[2951.28 → 2952.58] first Thessalonians
[2952.58 → 2954.44] the second letter
[2954.44 → 2954.96] the one that we're
[2954.96 → 2955.58] starting today
[2955.58 → 2956.72] was probably written
[2956.72 → 2957.90] only a few months
[2957.90 → 2958.32] later
[2958.32 → 2960.28] after the first one
[2960.28 → 2961.44] most likely
[2961.44 → 2963.10] after those people
[2963.10 → 2964.64] who had delivered
[2964.64 → 2965.64] the first letter
[2965.64 → 2966.56] to the church
[2966.56 → 2967.50] in Thessalonica
[2967.50 → 2969.02] and then turned around
[2969.02 → 2969.68] and returned
[2969.68 → 2970.58] to Paul
[2970.58 → 2971.16] while he was
[2971.16 → 2972.02] in Corinth
[2972.02 → 2973.20] and brought an update
[2973.20 → 2974.26] of what was happening
[2974.26 → 2974.60] there
[2974.60 → 2976.20] an update about
[2976.20 → 2977.00] how the persecution
[2977.00 → 2977.90] they were experiencing
[2977.90 → 2978.70] was getting worse
[2978.70 → 2980.60] and so Paul
[2980.60 → 2981.08] is moved
[2981.08 → 2982.32] to write to them again
[2982.32 → 2983.36] so he writes
[2983.36 → 2984.10] to the church
[2984.10 → 2985.40] of the Thessalonians
[2985.40 → 2986.56] in God
[2986.56 → 2987.28] our Father
[2987.28 → 2988.10] and the Lord
[2988.10 → 2989.28] Jesus Christ
[2989.28 → 2991.60] now for our purposes
[2991.60 → 2992.14] this morning
[2992.14 → 2992.78] what I want us
[2992.78 → 2993.28] to see
[2993.28 → 2994.74] right in these
[2994.74 → 2995.68] opening words
[2995.68 → 2996.58] is where Paul
[2996.58 → 2996.98] says
[2996.98 → 2997.60] God
[2997.60 → 2998.72] our
[2998.72 → 3000.16] Father
[3000.16 → 3002.74] this is how
[3002.74 → 3003.84] you can talk
[3003.84 → 3004.38] to God
[3004.38 → 3005.50] when you believe
[3005.50 → 3007.86] as your Father
[3007.86 → 3010.82] now in 1 Thessalonians
[3010.82 → 3011.26] Paul
[3011.26 → 3012.42] opened up
[3012.42 → 3013.36] by saying
[3013.36 → 3013.84] God
[3013.84 → 3014.62] the Father
[3014.62 → 3015.58] and the Lord
[3015.58 → 3016.66] Jesus Christ
[3016.66 → 3017.76] and in that letter
[3017.76 → 3018.34] in there
[3018.34 → 3019.74] he's making a claim
[3019.74 → 3020.80] about God's
[3020.80 → 3021.76] triune nature
[3021.76 → 3022.68] and about his
[3022.68 → 3023.88] special relationship
[3023.88 → 3024.70] as Father
[3024.70 → 3025.82] to Jesus
[3025.82 → 3026.66] the Son
[3026.66 → 3027.96] and now
[3027.96 → 3029.30] in the second letter
[3029.30 → 3030.18] he's adding
[3030.18 → 3031.92] to our experience
[3031.92 → 3032.52] of God
[3032.52 → 3033.28] by saying
[3033.28 → 3033.92] that because
[3033.92 → 3035.38] of Jesus
[3035.38 → 3036.84] he is
[3036.84 → 3037.74] your Father
[3037.74 → 3038.32] too
[3038.32 → 3038.72] God
[3038.72 → 3039.38] is your
[3039.38 → 3039.86] Father
[3039.86 → 3040.42] too
[3040.42 → 3041.08] you are
[3041.08 → 3041.88] his sons
[3041.88 → 3042.90] and daughters
[3042.90 → 3044.22] Paul's doing
[3044.22 → 3045.08] the same thing
[3045.08 → 3046.02] that Jesus
[3046.02 → 3046.50] did
[3046.50 → 3047.14] when he taught
[3047.14 → 3047.82] his disciples
[3047.82 → 3048.36] to pray
[3048.36 → 3049.72] right
[3049.72 → 3050.68] in Matthew 6
[3050.68 → 3051.60] Jesus teaches
[3051.60 → 3052.30] his disciples
[3052.30 → 3052.90] to pray
[3052.90 → 3054.32] our Father
[3054.32 → 3055.16] in heaven
[3055.16 → 3056.20] hallowed
[3056.20 → 3056.98] be your name
[3056.98 → 3059.16] our Father
[3059.16 → 3060.50] God
[3060.50 → 3061.60] is your Father
[3061.60 → 3062.26] and Jesus
[3062.26 → 3063.28] is your brother
[3063.28 → 3064.72] if you believe
[3064.72 → 3065.58] if you are
[3065.58 → 3066.38] born again
[3066.38 → 3067.00] if you
[3067.00 → 3068.38] confess with your lips
[3068.38 → 3069.00] and believe
[3069.00 → 3069.82] in your hearts
[3069.82 → 3070.42] that Jesus
[3070.42 → 3071.04] is Lord
[3071.04 → 3071.68] and that God
[3071.68 → 3072.36] raised him
[3072.36 → 3073.28] from the dead
[3073.28 → 3074.90] if that's you
[3074.90 → 3075.74] then Jesus
[3075.74 → 3076.48] is your brother
[3076.48 → 3077.04] and you have
[3077.04 → 3077.50] a Father
[3077.50 → 3078.06] in heaven
[3078.06 → 3079.54] and this
[3079.54 → 3080.36] changes
[3080.36 → 3081.44] how you pray
[3081.44 → 3082.94] right
[3082.94 → 3083.76] even if you
[3083.76 → 3084.16] have had
[3084.16 → 3084.68] the most
[3084.68 → 3085.54] excellent
[3085.54 → 3087.12] earthly fathers
[3087.12 → 3088.44] your heavenly
[3088.44 → 3088.94] Father
[3088.94 → 3090.16] is matchless
[3090.16 → 3091.48] and incomparable
[3091.48 → 3092.64] right
[3092.64 → 3093.66] even the best
[3093.66 → 3094.68] earthly fathers
[3094.68 → 3095.64] are a pale
[3095.64 → 3096.22] reflection
[3096.22 → 3097.28] of our heavenly
[3097.28 → 3097.70] Father
[3097.70 → 3099.96] but especially
[3099.96 → 3101.38] especially
[3101.38 → 3102.32] if you had
[3102.32 → 3103.36] an earthly
[3103.36 → 3103.80] father
[3103.80 → 3104.46] who failed
[3104.46 → 3104.80] you
[3104.80 → 3106.50] our heavenly
[3106.50 → 3106.90] Father
[3106.90 → 3107.60] never will
[3107.60 → 3109.44] right
[3109.44 → 3110.40] this is
[3110.40 → 3111.20] who we
[3111.20 → 3112.12] pray to
[3112.12 → 3112.60] these are
[3112.60 → 3113.38] the characteristics
[3113.38 → 3113.94] of God
[3113.94 → 3114.78] that we hold
[3114.78 → 3115.46] out in our
[3115.46 → 3115.84] prayers
[3115.84 → 3116.06] right
[3116.06 → 3116.44] that he is
[3116.44 → 3117.62] slow to angry
[3117.62 → 3118.68] and abounding
[3118.68 → 3119.72] in love
[3119.72 → 3121.12] right
[3121.12 → 3121.60] these are the
[3121.60 → 3122.14] characteristics
[3122.14 → 3122.70] of God
[3122.70 → 3123.38] when we pray
[3123.38 → 3124.54] that he is
[3124.54 → 3125.36] patient
[3125.36 → 3126.80] with our
[3126.80 → 3127.76] failures
[3127.76 → 3129.62] that he
[3129.62 → 3130.58] comforts us
[3130.58 → 3131.80] in trouble
[3131.80 → 3133.18] that he provides
[3133.18 → 3133.96] for all our
[3133.96 → 3134.38] needs
[3134.38 → 3135.00] that he is
[3135.00 → 3135.50] forgiving
[3135.50 → 3136.74] and merciful
[3136.74 → 3138.50] right
[3138.50 → 3139.22] our Father
[3139.22 → 3139.80] in heaven
[3139.80 → 3140.84] is forever
[3140.84 → 3141.96] faithful
[3141.96 → 3143.30] and unchanging
[3143.30 → 3144.56] you can trust
[3144.56 → 3144.94] him
[3144.94 → 3146.64] and all of
[3146.64 → 3147.00] that
[3147.00 → 3147.18] right
[3147.18 → 3147.50] you see
[3147.50 → 3147.88] it behind
[3147.88 → 3148.04] me
[3148.04 → 3148.48] all of
[3148.48 → 3148.64] that
[3148.64 → 3149.30] goes
[3149.30 → 3149.78] into
[3149.78 → 3150.10] that
[3150.10 → 3150.36] little
[3150.36 → 3151.04] phrase
[3151.04 → 3151.70] our
[3151.70 → 3152.26] Father
[3152.26 → 3153.48] all of
[3153.48 → 3153.70] that
[3153.70 → 3153.90] is
[3153.90 → 3154.48] packed
[3154.48 → 3154.92] into
[3154.92 → 3155.14] the
[3155.14 → 3155.46] words
[3155.46 → 3155.78] our
[3155.78 → 3156.26] Father
[3156.26 → 3157.14] when you
[3157.14 → 3157.48] pray
[3157.48 → 3159.38] and so
[3159.38 → 3160.14] if you were
[3160.14 → 3160.56] here with
[3160.56 → 3160.80] us
[3160.80 → 3161.58] last week
[3161.58 → 3161.96] if you
[3161.96 → 3162.74] add
[3162.74 → 3163.38] our
[3163.38 → 3163.84] Father
[3163.84 → 3164.58] to the
[3164.58 → 3165.36] amen
[3165.36 → 3166.04] the so
[3166.04 → 3166.60] be it
[3166.60 → 3167.16] the one
[3167.16 → 3167.68] who calls
[3167.68 → 3167.98] you are
[3167.98 → 3168.34] faithful
[3168.34 → 3168.70] and he
[3168.70 → 3169.06] will do
[3169.06 → 3169.18] it
[3169.18 → 3169.42] that we
[3169.42 → 3169.82] looked at
[3169.82 → 3170.38] last week
[3170.38 → 3170.92] right
[3170.92 → 3171.36] now
[3171.36 → 3171.98] you know
[3171.98 → 3172.26] how to
[3172.26 → 3172.64] start
[3172.64 → 3173.16] a prayer
[3173.16 → 3173.94] our
[3173.94 → 3174.34] Father
[3174.34 → 3175.54] and you
[3175.54 → 3175.72] know how
[3175.72 → 3176.08] to end
[3176.08 → 3176.56] a prayer
[3176.56 → 3178.64] the middle
[3178.64 → 3179.04] part
[3179.04 → 3179.78] you can
[3179.78 → 3180.04] add
[3180.04 → 3181.98] in fact
[3181.98 → 3182.24] we'll get
[3182.24 → 3182.48] to the
[3182.48 → 3182.62] middle
[3182.62 → 3182.84] part
[3182.84 → 3183.12] in just
[3183.12 → 3183.52] a second
[3183.52 → 3184.68] Paul
[3184.68 → 3185.22] continues
[3185.22 → 3185.74] he says
[3185.74 → 3186.60] grace
[3186.60 → 3187.68] and peace
[3187.68 → 3188.62] to you
[3188.62 → 3190.50] now
[3190.50 → 3191.42] some of
[3191.42 → 3191.62] you have
[3191.62 → 3191.92] heard me
[3191.92 → 3192.38] say this
[3192.38 → 3192.78] before
[3192.78 → 3193.12] but
[3193.12 → 3193.84] it's
[3193.84 → 3194.54] important
[3194.54 → 3195.08] and helpful
[3195.08 → 3195.68] for us
[3195.68 → 3196.10] to just
[3196.10 → 3196.80] define
[3196.80 → 3197.50] the word
[3197.50 → 3198.16] grace
[3198.16 → 3199.84] right
[3199.84 → 3200.40] grace
[3200.40 → 3201.24] is the
[3201.24 → 3202.08] unmerited
[3202.08 → 3203.08] disposition
[3203.08 → 3204.04] of God
[3204.04 → 3204.74] towards
[3204.74 → 3205.28] you
[3205.28 → 3206.44] and
[3206.44 → 3206.74] the
[3206.74 → 3207.48] unmerited
[3207.48 → 3208.06] disposition
[3208.06 → 3208.74] of God
[3208.74 → 3210.06] for you
[3210.06 → 3211.56] right
[3211.56 → 3211.74] God
[3211.74 → 3212.26] comes
[3212.26 → 3212.86] to you
[3212.86 → 3213.60] and he
[3213.60 → 3213.86] is
[3213.86 → 3214.50] for
[3214.50 → 3215.24] you
[3215.24 → 3216.90] and that's
[3216.90 → 3217.36] all part
[3217.36 → 3218.08] of whom
[3218.08 → 3218.76] he is
[3218.76 → 3219.10] and his
[3219.10 → 3219.72] relationship
[3219.72 → 3220.58] to you
[3220.58 → 3221.18] he comes
[3221.18 → 3221.74] to you
[3221.74 → 3222.16] before
[3222.16 → 3222.96] you ever
[3222.96 → 3223.38] thought
[3223.38 → 3223.88] about
[3223.88 → 3224.18] coming
[3224.18 → 3224.58] to him
[3224.58 → 3226.88] as Paul
[3226.88 → 3227.34] says
[3227.34 → 3228.10] elsewhere
[3228.10 → 3228.56] he writes
[3228.56 → 3229.06] in Romans
[3229.06 → 3230.02] but God
[3230.02 → 3230.62] demonstrates
[3230.62 → 3231.46] his own
[3231.46 → 3231.82] love
[3231.82 → 3232.36] for us
[3232.36 → 3233.04] in this
[3233.04 → 3234.24] while
[3234.24 → 3234.80] we were
[3234.80 → 3235.20] still
[3235.20 → 3235.82] sinners
[3235.82 → 3237.10] Christ
[3237.10 → 3238.04] died
[3238.04 → 3238.80] for us
[3238.80 → 3240.08] right
[3240.08 → 3240.36] that's
[3240.36 → 3240.80] grace
[3240.80 → 3242.16] that's
[3242.16 → 3242.52] grace
[3242.52 → 3242.92] God
[3242.92 → 3243.70] moves
[3243.70 → 3244.46] towards
[3244.46 → 3244.82] you
[3244.82 → 3245.46] first
[3245.46 → 3246.34] he
[3246.34 → 3247.22] initiates
[3247.22 → 3247.94] right
[3247.94 → 3248.28] before
[3248.28 → 3248.58] you
[3248.58 → 3249.00] called
[3249.00 → 3249.62] on him
[3249.62 → 3249.90] he
[3249.90 → 3250.46] calls
[3250.46 → 3251.10] you
[3251.10 → 3251.62] he
[3251.62 → 3252.14] draws
[3252.14 → 3252.48] you
[3252.48 → 3252.74] to
[3252.74 → 3253.26] himself
[3253.26 → 3255.40] and
[3255.40 → 3255.52] then
[3255.52 → 3255.88] after
[3255.88 → 3256.36] grace
[3256.36 → 3257.16] after
[3257.16 → 3257.64] grace
[3257.64 → 3258.14] comes
[3258.14 → 3259.06] peace
[3259.06 → 3261.78] that
[3261.78 → 3262.04] order
[3262.04 → 3262.24] is
[3262.24 → 3262.78] important
[3262.78 → 3264.12] God
[3264.12 → 3264.58] draws
[3264.58 → 3264.74] you
[3264.74 → 3264.90] to
[3264.90 → 3265.34] himself
[3265.34 → 3265.56] and
[3265.56 → 3265.74] his
[3265.74 → 3266.10] grace
[3266.10 → 3266.40] and
[3266.40 → 3266.54] the
[3266.54 → 3266.98] result
[3266.98 → 3267.24] of
[3267.24 → 3267.62] being
[3267.62 → 3268.16] in
[3268.16 → 3268.74] relationship
[3268.74 → 3269.04] with
[3269.04 → 3269.36] God
[3269.36 → 3269.94] is
[3269.94 → 3270.70] peace
[3270.70 → 3270.98] now
[3270.98 → 3271.56] again
[3271.56 → 3272.18] peace
[3272.18 → 3272.62] here
[3272.62 → 3272.92] is
[3272.92 → 3273.30] more
[3273.30 → 3273.60] than
[3273.60 → 3274.04] just
[3274.04 → 3274.48] the
[3274.48 → 3274.98] absence
[3274.98 → 3275.24] of
[3275.24 → 3276.00] conflict
[3276.00 → 3276.86] peace
[3276.86 → 3277.14] is
[3277.14 → 3277.48] more
[3277.48 → 3277.70] than
[3277.70 → 3278.06] just
[3278.06 → 3278.38] inner
[3278.38 → 3278.78] calm
[3278.78 → 3279.06] although
[3279.06 → 3279.26] I
[3279.26 → 3279.40] know
[3279.40 → 3279.72] a lot
[3279.72 → 3279.84] of
[3279.84 → 3279.98] us
[3279.98 → 3280.14] could
[3280.14 → 3280.38] use
[3280.38 → 3280.52] a
[3280.52 → 3280.62] little
[3280.62 → 3280.76] bit
[3280.76 → 3280.94] more
[3280.94 → 3281.22] inner
[3281.22 → 3281.58] calm
[3281.58 → 3281.80] right
[3281.80 → 3282.10] now
[3282.10 → 3282.80] right
[3282.80 → 3283.56] peace
[3283.56 → 3284.08] is
[3284.08 → 3284.66] in
[3284.66 → 3284.80] the
[3284.80 → 3285.38] biblical
[3285.38 → 3285.86] sense
[3285.86 → 3286.10] is
[3286.10 → 3286.80] holistic
[3286.80 → 3287.66] right
[3287.66 → 3287.88] in

[3289.40 → 3290.06] shalom
[3290.06 → 3290.92] it means
[3290.92 → 3291.92] wholeness
[3291.92 → 3292.30] it is
[3292.30 → 3293.26] all of

[3300.10 → 3300.44] made
[3300.44 → 3300.82] right
[3300.82 → 3301.18] because

[3302.84 → 3303.28] has
[3303.28 → 3303.56] been
[3303.56 → 3304.14] made
[3304.14 → 3304.72] right
[3304.72 → 3305.50] peace
[3305.50 → 3306.26] is
[3306.26 → 3306.54] the
[3306.54 → 3307.06] fruit
[3307.06 → 3307.48] of
[3307.48 → 3307.94] grace
[3307.94 → 3309.54] right

[4043.96 → 4044.18] God
[4044.18 → 4044.66] sustains
[4044.66 → 4044.86] us
[4044.86 → 4045.06] through
[4045.06 → 4045.64] death
[4045.64 → 4046.14] he
[4046.14 → 4046.34] can
[4046.34 → 4046.78] sustain
[4046.78 → 4047.10] us
[4047.10 → 4047.34] through

[4048.06 → 4049.12] 429
[4049.12 → 4049.94] and 430
[4049.94 → 4052.10] God

[4052.68 → 4053.04] fail
[4053.04 → 4054.02] he
[4054.02 → 4054.46] cannot
[4054.46 → 4056.02] and
[4056.02 → 4056.42] so
[4056.42 → 4058.02] his
[4058.02 → 4058.60] church
[4058.60 → 4059.90] will
[4059.90 → 4060.34] endure
[4060.34 → 4061.46] and
[4061.46 → 4061.78] you
[4061.78 → 4062.26] can
[4062.26 → 4063.34] persevere
[4063.34 → 4064.10] precisely
[4064.10 → 4064.78] because

[4066.56 → 4067.84] and
[4067.84 → 4068.14] just
[4068.14 → 4068.40] like
[4068.40 → 4069.04] Polycarp
[4069.04 → 4069.28] just

[4069.52 → 4069.78] Paul
[4069.78 → 4070.16] before
[4070.16 → 4070.36] him
[4070.36 → 4070.66] just
[4070.66 → 4070.92] like
[4070.92 → 4071.08] the
[4071.08 → 4071.72] Thessalonians
[4071.72 → 4072.00] we
[4072.00 → 4072.40] today

[4077.62 → 4078.42] work
[4078.42 → 4079.26] that's
[4079.26 → 4079.76] exactly
[4079.76 → 4080.38] what
[4080.38 → 4080.58] Paul
[4080.58 → 4080.88] says
[4080.88 → 4081.32] next
[4081.32 → 4083.06] all
