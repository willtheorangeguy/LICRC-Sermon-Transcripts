[0.00 → 7.58] Jesus wants you. Jesus died for you. We just celebrated Easter and it's real. It is real.
[9.26 → 21.14] Anyway, okay, first the announcement from Council. All members are invited to barbecue and lawn games on Thursday the 22nd at 6 p.m.
[21.60 → 28.82] followed by an AGM at 7. The packet for this meeting went out last week. Please read it over.
[28.82 → 40.14] We will be voting to approve last year's financial statements. The packet also includes Council's follow-up to the Town Hall we had about calling Pastor Kevin as Minister of the Word.
[40.84 → 48.90] We call that document our shared future. Please read that before the meeting as we will also be discussing the process.
[50.08 → 56.06] Council presents the following people who have been nominated and approved for the Office of Elder and Deacon.
[56.06 → 67.52] For the Office of Deacon, Pete Birken pass, Carolyn Spoor, Warren Heroes. We will draw lots for two open positions at a later date.
[68.22 → 75.96] For the Office of Pastoral Elder, Pete Birken pass, Jesus Hernandez, PIM School, Frank Welding, and Sam Wind.
[75.96 → 79.66] We will draw lots for three positions.
[80.66 → 87.74] The Lord willing, as part of our worship service on May 25, we will vote to affirm the slate of nominees by ballot.
[88.60 → 92.78] Once the nominees are affirmed, the drawing of lots will take place on June 1st.
[93.64 → 97.96] The installation will take place on Pentecost Monday, June 8th.
[97.96 → 100.38] And now a few prayer notes.
[101.62 → 109.74] Ben Walters and Leanne Meanders were united in marriage in Smithville, Ontario, on May 24th this year.
[110.30 → 116.72] Congrats to them, to Jake and Annette, and to the whole extended family of Ben and Leanne.
[116.72 → 127.00] As I was reading this earlier and what I was supposed to say, there is another couple who got married not this past Saturday, but the Saturday before that.
[127.66 → 133.60] And it just so happens they are here, and it is Jason and Kathy Lee Kennelling.
[134.24 → 134.66] Congrats.
[134.66 → 134.84] Congrats.
[136.04 → 145.64] And there is another couple who are also in that family, who I won't mention yet because it's a little premature, but they are also going to get married this summer.
[146.24 → 147.60] So congrats to you too.
[148.50 → 149.26] Blessings, people.
[150.90 → 152.18] It's time to pray.
[152.60 → 156.20] This morning, I want to remember Tessa.
[157.34 → 160.02] I want to remember Doug, two people who are dealing with cancer.
[160.02 → 163.08] And also Tanya and her family.
[164.46 → 167.04] It's always awesome to see Tanya here.
[168.60 → 169.94] And we pray.
[170.30 → 170.78] We pray.
[171.78 → 182.10] Rachel Shipper also yesterday, they had a service for her in upcountry.
[182.64 → 183.34] Forget the name.
[184.46 → 187.76] It happens when you get a certain age, if you don't write it down.
[188.04 → 189.66] That's maybe why they wrote this down.
[191.02 → 193.72] Anyway, the extended family is the whistling and the shippers.
[195.04 → 196.60] So we pray for them.
[198.46 → 203.10] I was reminded this morning as we were sitting here, as we were singing, as we were praising God,
[203.10 → 208.52] you know, on any given Sunday, there's thousands and thousands of churches worshipping.
[208.52 → 212.80] And we all seem to think that maybe ours is the best way.
[212.80 → 215.62] But God incorporates us all.
[216.40 → 219.86] And there's no two like people ever, anywhere.
[219.86 → 227.64] And then the other thing, on my journey, I read a few books from Corrie ten Boom.
[227.64 → 229.74] And she lived through the war.
[229.74 → 234.52] And she became a minister, pastor, missionary, call it what you want.
[234.74 → 236.86] And she went to a lot of communist countries.
[237.52 → 239.60] And I forget which country she went to.
[240.24 → 246.54] But they told her specifically, because she would go to to preach, specifically she was not allowed to preach.
[246.54 → 247.40] But she could pray.
[248.22 → 249.16] So guess what?
[249.78 → 251.68] She prayed for two hours.
[252.62 → 254.00] Which I'm not going to do, but.
[255.26 → 256.16] Anyway, let's pray.
[256.16 → 263.04] Our Father, who art in heaven, Lord, hallowed be your name.
[264.62 → 274.04] Lord, we praise you this morning that we could share in the joy of Mark and Dee and their beautiful kids, Lord.
[275.32 → 278.54] Lord, you watched our journey, every one of us.
[280.30 → 282.28] Sometimes it's pretty straightforward.
[282.62 → 283.54] A lot of times it's not.
[284.36 → 285.40] But you don't forget us.
[285.40 → 286.46] You never forget us.
[286.94 → 295.62] You place things in our midst to remind us of you, of Jesus, of what he's done for us.
[296.46 → 300.10] Lord, we just talked about the men in prison, or the women in prison.
[301.68 → 304.42] And they're there for a reason, but some of us could be as well.
[305.46 → 306.66] We're all sinners, Lord.
[307.22 → 311.86] And we thank you that Jesus, you sent Jesus to take care of that whole thing.
[312.64 → 313.40] Thank you, Lord.
[313.40 → 316.04] Lord, we pray for the kids.
[316.68 → 323.00] Lord, for those of us who've been given children such a blessing and a challenge.
[323.82 → 324.90] We pray for the moms.
[326.06 → 332.64] Lord, we pray will you be with them day after day as the kids grow up.
[332.64 → 336.12] Lord, when they're small, help us to be examples.
[336.12 → 344.72] Lord, examples in not just do what I tell you to, but watch what I do.
[344.72 → 347.22] Lord, do we pray?
[347.42 → 349.12] Do we let our kids see us pray?
[349.40 → 350.74] Do we pray with them?
[351.68 → 353.06] Do we read your word?
[353.54 → 355.62] Lord, we've got a whole book you sent us.
[356.08 → 358.86] Do we actually read it with our kids, with each other?
[358.86 → 366.34] Lord, or do we prefer to watch a football game or maybe a hockey game or whatever else we do?
[367.54 → 371.62] Lord, a couple Sundays ago, Kevin said, Gospel of John.
[372.32 → 374.66] Just in one sitting, read the Gospel of John.
[374.66 → 378.58] So, Lord, some of us have done that.
[378.68 → 379.62] It only took two hours.
[380.98 → 381.76] Two hours.
[381.84 → 383.62] That's faster than a game.
[385.38 → 387.36] Lord, you know each one of us.
[388.12 → 395.08] You tell us in Psalm 139 that you knew us before we were named.
[395.94 → 397.62] You watched us being formed.
[397.62 → 407.04] Lord, you've got the days, every one of our days written in your book before one of them came to be.
[408.06 → 409.24] How amazing is that, Lord?
[411.94 → 416.42] Lord, we ask you that you give us understanding, that you guide us.
[416.62 → 422.66] Lord, that you help us realize what's important and what's not really important, Lord.
[422.66 → 430.04] Lord, if we're Christians, we're going to heaven, and we praise you and thank you that you died for us.
[431.98 → 443.48] And, Lord, you ask us, or you invite us to make that same commitment if we're not, if our sins are not forgiven, Lord.
[443.78 → 445.30] It seems just way too easy.
[445.30 → 452.52] But you did it all for us, for the people in jail, for whomever.
[453.54 → 460.48] Lord, and you will call, you have called, and you are calling those who you want.
[461.70 → 462.96] Lord, we thank you for your blessings.
[463.74 → 465.58] We help us to prioritize.
[467.08 → 470.88] Lord, we thank you that you give us our needs, not so much our wants.
[470.88 → 474.84] We thank you, Lord, that you answer prayer any time we pray.
[475.56 → 478.62] We thank you, Lord, that you take time to listen to us.
[479.16 → 479.76] Imagine that.
[480.88 → 489.04] The maker of us, the maker of heaven and earth, takes time to listen to each one of us and counts each one of us special, Lord.
[489.92 → 491.44] Lord, will you press that upon our hearts?
[492.34 → 493.36] Today, this week.
[493.36 → 504.34] Lord, as we drive somewhere by ourselves, and we think about these things, Lord, with your spirit, will you fill us with prompts from yourself, Lord?
[504.64 → 505.42] And we thank you.
[506.16 → 508.08] How amazing you set it all up, Lord.
[509.26 → 512.26] And we thank you, Lord, for the people who've gone before us.
[512.42 → 517.44] Most of us can think of friends, family, parents.
[518.76 → 520.28] We've had to say goodbye to, Lord.
[520.28 → 524.56] We pray for those people, Lord, because there's a void.
[524.70 → 525.52] There's always a void.
[527.42 → 529.04] But we pray we help each one of us.
[529.74 → 531.46] We thank you for today again.
[532.38 → 533.40] We thank you for the blessings.
[534.02 → 536.72] We thank you that Josh is bringing your word next.
[537.16 → 542.58] We pray we give him wisdom and insight and boldness to proclaim your word, Lord.
[543.10 → 544.26] Thank you for your love and care.
[544.36 → 545.10] In Jesus' name, amen.
[550.28 → 580.26] Thank you for your love and care.
[580.58 → 584.40] And for the other nerds out there, eschatology.
[584.88 → 586.82] The study of the last things.
[587.26 → 588.94] Death, our destiny after it.
[589.76 → 592.80] The last days, Armageddon, judgment day.
[593.10 → 594.00] All fun things.
[594.62 → 599.68] And we get to do that today in our passage today, 2 Thessalonians 1, 7 to 12.
[599.68 → 607.98] While you are opening your Bibles or your devices to the passage, we must remember what Chris preached last Sunday.
[608.98 → 616.06] Paul opens up the letter of 2 Thessalonians with God's grace and peace about the way it shapes the church and our gratitude,
[616.06 → 620.38] but also our response of faith for what God has in store in the future.
[620.98 → 629.74] As terrifying as it may seem with all its uncertainty and chaos, let us remember there is no uncertainty in God's sovereignty.
[630.70 → 632.12] He is faithful.
[632.12 → 639.32] And with the reminder, let's start reading in verse 6 to connect back a little to Chris' sermon.
[639.32 → 644.84] God is just.
[645.68 → 652.18] He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you and give relief to you who are troubled and to us as well.
[652.18 → 658.50] This will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful angels.
[659.30 → 663.22] He will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
[664.16 → 669.98] They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord from the glory of his might.
[670.90 → 676.50] On the day he comes to be glorified in his holy people and to be marvelled at among those who have believed.
[677.30 → 681.52] This includes you because you believed our testimony to you.
[682.66 → 687.38] With this in mind, we constantly pray for you that our God may make you worthy of his calling
[687.38 → 695.46] and that by his power he may bring to fruition every desire for goodness and your every deed prompted by faith.
[696.48 → 701.14] We pray this so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you and your in him,
[702.08 → 704.98] according to the grace of our God and Lord Jesus Christ.
[708.52 → 709.72] This is the word of the Lord.
[712.18 → 718.54] Many of us are obsessed with the end of the world, the apocalypse.
[719.50 → 727.16] The movies we watch like The Terminator, War of the Worlds, Mad Max, 28 Days Later, Interstellar, Planet of the Apes,
[727.44 → 730.28] The Day After Tomorrow, even the Pixar movie WALL-E,
[730.28 → 734.80] and the famously questionable Christian movie Left Behind.
[737.54 → 742.32] Though these movies all present a way humanity could find its demise,
[742.88 → 744.50] the way that this world could end,
[744.90 → 749.70] either with zombies, monsters, robots, God, nature, or even garbage,
[750.52 → 751.44] in the case of WALL-E.
[751.44 → 758.60] Sometimes the end time comes slowly, sometimes sudden, sometimes it's preventable, and other times inevitable.
[758.60 → 761.74] And it's not just movies.
[762.46 → 769.10] Our books often depict evil or destructive things, or a being or a force that will destroy everything.
[769.74 → 773.30] The greatest fantasy book and movie, Lord of the Rings,
[773.70 → 779.64] centred on a plot to stop the Dark Lord Sauron from destroying all the good and beauty in Middle Earth,
[779.64 → 781.76] and along with all its inhabitants.
[782.68 → 788.42] In all of these stories, it's either something evil trying to destroy all that exists,
[788.62 → 791.22] or something mindless just going through the motions,
[791.46 → 794.14] and humanity and life is helpless to stop it.
[795.42 → 797.84] Many of us are obsessed with the end,
[798.28 → 799.98] and some of us are terrified of it.
[800.60 → 801.86] We love this place.
[802.48 → 804.06] Our families, our friends,
[804.42 → 807.22] we love food and the activities we busy ourselves with.
[807.22 → 809.00] We love the sunsets.
[809.16 → 812.58] We love weddings and gatherings and music and baptisms.
[814.24 → 816.02] There's a lot in this world to love.
[817.86 → 821.06] And the idea of it ending is terrifying to us,
[821.62 → 824.38] especially if we don't know how it's going to end.
[825.16 → 827.82] We worry it's going to be long and painful.
[828.70 → 832.24] We also worry it's going to be too quick for us to notice and put our affairs in order
[832.24 → 833.74] to make the end good.
[835.02 → 836.96] We're mostly scared about what comes after.
[837.72 → 840.64] The dread of that mysterious end that no one can see.
[841.44 → 844.92] When the curtain call goes, does the show just end, or is there an encore?
[847.08 → 849.34] Paul is addressing this idea today.
[849.94 → 852.92] What do we do with the end of our lives and the end of days?
[854.88 → 856.54] What does the Bible say about this?
[856.74 → 858.28] Where is God in all of this?
[858.28 → 864.74] Our passage today, written by Paul and much of 2 Thessalonians, deals with this area of life.
[865.28 → 869.30] And Paul's unexpected answer to this problem we face is our big idea.
[870.14 → 876.48] The apocalypse is the relief from our trials today and hope for God's people in eternity.
[877.84 → 881.42] Relief for our trials today and hope for God's people in eternity.
[881.42 → 891.12] The reason the apocalypse is the relief and hope is that the apocalypse is not about a day.
[891.12 → 892.28] It's not a time.
[892.44 → 893.54] It's not a cataclysm.
[893.54 → 902.56] The apocalypse comes from the Greek word apocalypses, which means revelation, unveiling, or revealing.
[903.84 → 906.36] The Bible is the revelation of God.
[907.32 → 909.24] Christ is the revelation of God.
[909.24 → 912.84] This Bible is the apocalypse.
[913.88 → 914.76] Not an event.
[916.20 → 918.24] This isn't just fancy wordplay.
[918.58 → 919.98] This is everything we believe.
[920.72 → 927.60] It's not just the events in certain parts of the Bible where it talks about cataclysms and fights with Satan and the angel Michael.
[927.98 → 929.86] It's not just judgment day.
[930.04 → 933.24] And it's not a set of tribulations that rip the earth in half.
[933.24 → 945.96] The core of Christianity, the life, death, and resurrection of Christ, and his eventual return is not just about what happens right now.
[947.20 → 949.22] It's also about the end of the world.
[950.72 → 955.74] His death saves us from condemnation now and on that last day.
[956.72 → 957.68] There are two parts.
[959.46 → 960.24] But let's go see.
[960.90 → 961.96] Let's go through and see how.
[961.96 → 974.20] Over and over again, phrases like in that day, on that day, or the day of the Lord describe a future event where God's judgment comes for his enemies and salvation for his people.
[975.26 → 982.82] In many cases here, the word day doesn't mean a 24-hour period of time, but simply a time at some point in the future.
[984.00 → 989.98] For example, many times in the New Testament, it will describe a time after the disciples as the last days.
[989.98 → 992.50] 2 Timothy 3.1 says,
[992.50 → 995.82] But mark this, there will be terrible times in the last days.
[996.64 → 997.50] Hebrews 1.2,
[997.66 → 1004.88] But in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he also made the universe.
[1005.92 → 1007.14] 2 Peter 3.3,
[1007.50 → 1013.52] Above all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires.
[1013.52 → 1016.92] It's been 2,000 years.
[1017.60 → 1019.20] That's a lot of last days.
[1019.90 → 1022.18] Or a long, long last day.
[1022.18 → 1026.34] Phrases in the Bible are important.
[1027.54 → 1034.28] The Bible was written by a people that didn't speak English and by people that wrote differently than us.
[1034.92 → 1040.68] They had different techniques and different methods, and those people knew those techniques and those methods.
[1040.68 → 1047.90] And one of those techniques is the reusing of similar phrases across the whole canon.
[1048.52 → 1054.78] So when you see that phrase, it makes you think of all the other times that phrase is used.
[1054.78 → 1067.88] That phrase creates a chain of increasing complexity, revealing to the person who's reading the story a concept or idea that God has been teaching his people across the whole Bible.
[1068.48 → 1072.68] And by reading it over and over again, it starts to make more sense.
[1073.26 → 1074.54] It becomes more clear.
[1075.06 → 1077.36] But it takes reading it to see the pattern.
[1078.42 → 1081.30] This method is part of what's called typology.
[1081.30 → 1088.86] And in this phrase, in the beginning of verse 10 of 2 Thessalonians, is the phrase we will follow today.
[1089.54 → 1090.58] On the day.
[1093.34 → 1101.18] And as we go through a couple examples, note that there are two parts to each of the passages that we go through and how this phrase is used.
[1103.22 → 1105.74] God's Word is rich.
[1106.22 → 1108.64] It's complex and yet beautifully simple.
[1108.64 → 1111.06] It is the perfect book.
[1111.72 → 1115.54] It reaches every person where they are at and brings them closer to God.
[1116.20 → 1123.26] But sometimes in our attempt to read this massive tome, we are slogged down in Numbers or Leviticus.
[1123.80 → 1124.70] And I get it.
[1125.28 → 1129.76] There are parts of the Bible that I yawn at when reading, even though I'm obsessed with it.
[1129.76 → 1135.90] But when we go through the whole Bible, and we see how this book interconnects, and we see the complexity,
[1136.92 → 1138.42] sometimes it takes more than one read.
[1138.88 → 1139.90] It's mind-blowing.
[1140.94 → 1142.56] So please, follow along.
[1143.40 → 1148.32] Deal with this just for a little as we track through some passages and see what God is telling us today.
[1150.00 → 1154.12] Our first use of this term is right in the beginning in Genesis.
[1154.12 → 1159.44] In Genesis 2, God makes the garden and then makes Adam and places him in the garden.
[1160.04 → 1163.10] He tells him that he can eat of any tree and then says this,
[1164.40 → 1167.04] But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat.
[1167.74 → 1171.50] For in the day that you eat of it, you shall surely die.
[1172.82 → 1175.28] We see our phrase here right at the end.
[1175.52 → 1178.36] For in the day you eat of it, you shall surely die.
[1179.10 → 1181.56] Now, this use of the phrase seems pretty normal.
[1181.56 → 1187.02] Well, God is just telling Adam, whatever day you happen to eat of the fruit, you'll die.
[1188.06 → 1189.34] Why single this out?
[1190.72 → 1193.16] Well, because Adam doesn't die that day.
[1194.30 → 1195.58] Remember, there are two parts.
[1196.36 → 1199.94] The first part is Adam and Eve are cursed that day that they eat the fruit.
[1201.16 → 1206.08] All their relationships are broken between God, each other, and nature and themselves.
[1206.42 → 1207.60] They die spiritually.
[1208.32 → 1209.90] And Ephesians 2.1 tells us how.
[1209.90 → 1214.22] As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins.
[1215.32 → 1220.28] And the second part of this event is that God tells them that they will die physically,
[1220.62 → 1222.56] returning to the dust that they were made.
[1225.36 → 1226.90] Let's jump to Deuteronomy 32.
[1227.52 → 1231.68] In Deuteronomy 32, we are given a heavenly view of history through poetry.
[1232.18 → 1233.64] And he tells them two things.
[1233.64 → 1236.00] God tells them that he made the earth.
[1236.52 → 1240.04] And because of humanity's sin, he gave them over to the gods they worshipped instead of him,
[1240.44 → 1244.80] dividing the nation, and kept Israel for himself as his inheritance,
[1245.20 → 1246.72] despite the rejection of him as well.
[1247.46 → 1249.92] And in verse 35 to 36, we get our phrase again.
[1249.92 → 1272.50] And so we see there are two parts again in Deuteronomy 32.
[1272.50 → 1278.96] The first part is that God has judged the nations, giving them over to their tiny gods
[1278.96 → 1281.68] and letting them be ruled by their sinful desires.
[1282.42 → 1286.00] And the second part is that because of their continued sin,
[1286.38 → 1291.30] he will have his vengeance on that future day out of compassion for his people.
[1291.30 → 1294.78] Two parts.
[1295.80 → 1298.38] We then jump to the book of Isaiah, chapter 7.
[1299.48 → 1305.10] Isaiah is sent to King Ahaz to tell them that because of Israel's sin and lack of repentance
[1305.10 → 1307.06] and disregard for God and his law,
[1307.74 → 1310.74] God has sent the king of Assyria to bring destruction to Israel.
[1311.44 → 1316.80] With a promised restoration later on in verses 18 to 25, we see our phrase again.
[1316.80 → 1322.70] In that day, the Lord will whistle for flies from the Nile Delta in Egypt
[1322.70 → 1324.68] and for the bees from the land of Assyria.
[1325.18 → 1328.66] They will all come and settle in the steep ravines and in the crevices of the rocks,
[1329.14 → 1331.96] on all the thorn bushes and at all the watering holes.
[1332.24 → 1335.86] In that day, the Lord will use a razor hired from beyond the Euphrates River,
[1335.98 → 1340.50] the king of Assyria, to shave your head and private parts and to cut off your beard also.
[1341.34 → 1344.50] And it continues like this for another five verses,
[1344.50 → 1352.22] repeating that phrase in that day over and over again for both the invasion and the restoration,
[1353.24 → 1355.86] hinting to us that that day is more than that.
[1356.84 → 1358.32] And again, we see two parts.
[1359.04 → 1362.26] The first part is that Israel will soon come under siege by Assyria.
[1362.82 → 1366.28] And the second part is that Israel later on will be destroyed.
[1366.28 → 1374.14] But that phrase in that day is used for both events, the destruction and the restoration.
[1374.50 → 1382.04] Our next passage is in Joel 2, verses 1-2 and verses 28-32.
[1382.04 → 1388.50] Chapter 2 of Joel is another heavenly view of history, like Deuteronomy.
[1389.04 → 1392.26] And the beginning and the end sections use the phrase we've been following.
[1393.02 → 1397.14] And what we see is, again, two parts.
[1397.82 → 1400.00] The first part is that on the day of the Lord,
[1400.44 → 1406.24] God is sending judgment in the form of an unnamed but also historically unmatched army.
[1406.24 → 1407.96] Verses 1 and 2.
[1407.96 → 1411.36] Blow the trumpet in Zion, sound the alarm on my holy hill.
[1411.92 → 1415.42] Let all who live in the land tremble, for the day of the Lord is coming.
[1416.42 → 1421.96] It is close at hand, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and blackness.
[1422.36 → 1426.12] Like dawn spreading across the mountains, a large mighty army comes,
[1426.40 → 1430.32] such as never was in ancient times nor ever will be in ages to come.
[1430.32 → 1436.76] And the second part is that God, like in Isaiah, is going to restore his people.
[1437.52 → 1441.20] But more than that, his people don't just include Israel this time,
[1441.94 → 1449.16] but people from all nations and the further promise of God's spirit dwelling and empowering with his people.
[1449.88 → 1451.78] Verses 28-31.
[1451.78 → 1454.48] And afterwards I will pour out my spirit on all people.
[1454.80 → 1459.94] Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions.
[1460.60 → 1464.86] Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my spirit in those days.
[1465.06 → 1469.00] I will show wonders in the heavens and on earth, blood and fire and billows of smoke.
[1469.42 → 1474.88] The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.
[1474.88 → 1484.40] Both this imminent invasion from this unmatched army and the future restoration and further blessing of God's people
[1484.40 → 1487.82] happen on that same great day of the Lord.
[1489.84 → 1491.38] We now jump to the New Testament.
[1491.64 → 1492.30] We're just about done.
[1494.14 → 1497.60] This is one of the last passages that connects this chain together.
[1497.60 → 1505.08] In the Gospel of John, we see that Jesus himself uses this phrase in John chapter 14, verses 19-20.
[1506.10 → 1510.10] In chapter 14, Jesus is teaching the many last things before he goes,
[1510.26 → 1516.46] and he promises the imminent death, his imminent death, and that the Holy Spirit would come after he dies.
[1517.36 → 1519.14] And in verses 19-20, this is what we read.
[1519.60 → 1526.60] Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me, because I live, you also will live.
[1526.60 → 1533.52] On that day, you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.
[1535.54 → 1538.36] There are two parts to this day he's talking about.
[1538.70 → 1544.02] The first is that he will disappear, and the second part is that they will live because he lives in them.
[1546.22 → 1547.34] What is this day?
[1548.46 → 1549.46] When is this?
[1549.46 → 1556.90] Jesus is intentionally using the same phrases in Genesis, Deuteronomy, Isaiah, Joel,
[1557.08 → 1560.30] to highlight what the day he is talking about will look like.
[1561.12 → 1568.88] All of those uses of that phrase have taught us something about Jesus' use here in his promise to his disciples.
[1568.88 → 1580.72] What day could Jesus be talking about where we see someone who isn't sinful become sin and is cursed by God?
[1581.40 → 1582.42] Like in Genesis.
[1583.12 → 1588.88] What day could we see Jesus be talking about where God makes a special people for himself
[1588.88 → 1591.90] and separates them from those who are evil?
[1591.90 → 1594.34] Like in Deuteronomy.
[1594.94 → 1602.60] What day could Jesus be talking about where God brings both his wrath and his blessing on his people?
[1602.98 → 1603.62] Like in Isaiah.
[1604.32 → 1611.26] What day could Jesus be talking about where he both destroys his people and gives them his spirit
[1611.26 → 1612.82] and brings them to life?
[1613.22 → 1613.98] Like in Joel.
[1613.98 → 1619.70] What day could Jesus be speaking about where he disappears and people get life?
[1620.18 → 1621.06] Like in John.
[1622.12 → 1623.46] Is it his crucifixion?
[1624.00 → 1625.18] Is it his resurrection?
[1625.68 → 1626.74] Is it his ascension?
[1627.22 → 1628.22] Is it Pentecost?
[1628.62 → 1630.22] Or is it even his return?
[1631.74 → 1633.12] The answer is yes.
[1634.28 → 1641.44] The day Jesus is talking about, the day all these previous stories are hinting at, teaching us about,
[1641.44 → 1645.20] the day of the Lord is all of the above.
[1646.18 → 1650.66] Remember the day in that phrase used over and over again isn't 24 hours.
[1651.68 → 1655.96] In Genesis and Deuteronomy, it was one day with a promise of another day later on.
[1656.54 → 1660.36] And in Isaiah and Joel, it was a calamity that happened over a period of time
[1660.36 → 1663.48] with the promise that there would be a period of restoration after.
[1664.56 → 1669.50] Just like how all of those days consisted of events of larger spans of time,
[1669.50 → 1675.90] so it is with Christ's death and resurrection and ascension and Pentecost and his awaited return.
[1676.86 → 1678.56] They are all linked.
[1679.34 → 1681.32] They're not just series of events.
[1681.48 → 1685.04] They are elements stemming from one unifying purpose.
[1685.82 → 1688.60] Just like all those elements from Genesis to John,
[1688.78 → 1691.86] these four days are all linked together,
[1692.02 → 1695.56] telling a bigger story about God's plan for salvation
[1695.56 → 1698.18] and the outpouring of his wrath upon sin.
[1699.38 → 1703.68] All of these ideas find their purpose and unity in Jesus.
[1704.58 → 1707.78] Salvation and wrath, justice and vengeance,
[1708.54 → 1709.80] mercy and blessing,
[1710.40 → 1712.34] all find their purpose in him.
[1713.40 → 1718.04] It was on that great and terrifying and beautiful day of the Lord
[1718.04 → 1719.60] where God became man,
[1720.08 → 1721.46] lived the life we should have lived,
[1721.80 → 1723.24] died the death we should have died,
[1723.46 → 1724.90] and later rose from the dead
[1724.90 → 1727.48] and restored, ascended to be with his Father,
[1727.88 → 1730.08] and the Spirit came down and filled the church.
[1731.52 → 1732.80] And now look at this.
[1733.50 → 1736.98] Remember how when with Adam, there were two parts.
[1738.12 → 1739.24] He died spiritually
[1739.24 → 1741.40] and was promised a future death.
[1741.40 → 1745.80] Christ is using that same phrase to hint to his disciples
[1745.80 → 1748.28] that there are two parts to this new life.
[1749.00 → 1752.06] The first part is that his disciples and every Christian
[1752.06 → 1755.68] given new life spiritually.
[1756.66 → 1758.38] We are raised from the dead spiritually.
[1758.86 → 1761.84] Our relationship with God, nature, each other, and ourselves
[1761.84 → 1763.12] is on the mend.
[1764.30 → 1768.06] And the second part is the promise of a physical resurrection
[1768.06 → 1770.74] where we will be united with our Saviour forever.
[1771.40 → 1774.44] This is our big idea revisited.
[1775.04 → 1779.02] The apocalypse is our relief from today's trials
[1779.02 → 1781.84] and hope for God's people in eternity.
[1783.08 → 1785.96] God has turned the curse into blessing.
[1786.78 → 1788.54] For God's people, judgment is blessing,
[1788.78 → 1790.14] and his enemies, it is vengeance.
[1790.98 → 1795.00] For his people, it is God's perfect justice means grace,
[1795.58 → 1797.98] and for his enemies, it means condemnation.
[1797.98 → 1801.64] That great and terrible day of the Lord,
[1802.06 → 1804.24] that final day to end all days,
[1804.60 → 1806.82] where God separates for the last time
[1806.82 → 1808.74] his people and his enemies,
[1809.16 → 1811.52] where God will give the promised final death
[1811.52 → 1813.04] and the promised final life,
[1813.62 → 1816.40] that day is hope for his people
[1816.40 → 1819.32] and terror to everyone else.
[1819.32 → 1823.58] He will punish those who do not know God
[1823.58 → 1825.82] and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
[1829.00 → 1833.48] We were all dead in our trespasses like Adam.
[1834.48 → 1835.92] That's where this all started.
[1836.88 → 1837.90] We were all condemned.
[1838.76 → 1840.28] We were all the enemy of God.
[1841.34 → 1843.96] That day of the Lord would have been terror
[1843.96 → 1847.62] and judgment for us all if it wasn't for Jesus.
[1848.52 → 1850.54] In Deuteronomy, we see that God doesn't want
[1850.54 → 1851.54] to condemn everyone.
[1852.32 → 1854.90] He is merciful and wants to reconcile
[1854.90 → 1857.86] our relationship with him that we destroyed.
[1858.98 → 1861.46] And in Isaiah, we see that God is promising restoration
[1861.46 → 1863.72] for our relationship with him,
[1864.34 → 1868.34] that if we only recognize that we were the ones
[1868.34 → 1869.92] that brought the calamity and death.
[1869.92 → 1872.92] We were the ones that brought destruction.
[1874.00 → 1875.54] And in Joel, we learned that the promise
[1875.54 → 1878.02] isn't just for those who are currently his people,
[1878.76 → 1882.58] but that it is open to every single human being on earth.
[1883.30 → 1886.04] Everyone can repent and have unity with God.
[1886.92 → 1890.60] We are the bringers of destruction, decay, and death.
[1891.50 → 1894.78] God is the one who brings relief, hope, and life.
[1895.60 → 1896.82] He has promised forgiveness.
[1896.82 → 1902.52] You, even you, can repent.
[1902.80 → 1905.72] No matter how small or big the sin is,
[1906.26 → 1907.82] you can repent.
[1908.56 → 1909.84] He wants you back.
[1910.52 → 1912.24] He proved it by dying for you.
[1916.44 → 1918.24] Let's read verses 10 to 12 again.
[1920.20 → 1923.54] On the day he comes to be glorified in his people
[1923.54 → 1926.24] and to be marvelled at among those who believed,
[1926.82 → 1927.82] this includes you,
[1928.56 → 1930.86] because you believed our testimony to you.
[1931.86 → 1932.70] With this in mind,
[1933.02 → 1934.48] we constantly pray for you,
[1934.98 → 1936.94] that our God may make you worthy of his calling,
[1937.34 → 1938.44] and that by his power,
[1938.56 → 1942.00] he may bring fruition to your every desire for goodness
[1942.00 → 1945.12] and every deed prompted by faith.
[1945.82 → 1947.90] We pray this so that the name of our Lord Jesus
[1947.90 → 1949.22] may be glorified in you,
[1949.66 → 1950.46] and you in him,
[1951.34 → 1952.78] according to the grace of our God
[1952.78 → 1954.12] and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1954.12 → 1957.26] Do you see that language?
[1958.38 → 1959.86] Remember, there are two parts.
[1960.90 → 1965.10] The first part is that they believed in the testimony of Paul,
[1965.46 → 1967.30] and the second part is that
[1967.30 → 1969.10] because they believed in the testimony,
[1969.60 → 1972.72] they will be glorified with Christ in eternity.
[1972.72 → 1976.64] This applies to us here today.
[1977.44 → 1978.80] The promise of repentance,
[1979.26 → 1981.52] of true and actual belief.
[1982.20 → 1983.32] Christ, the word of God,
[1983.44 → 1984.60] that testifies to us.
[1984.98 → 1985.80] In this case,
[1985.92 → 1987.50] Paul's message to the Thessalonians,
[1987.90 → 1988.64] this belief,
[1988.86 → 1989.46] this faith,
[1990.02 → 1991.40] comes with a promise.
[1992.46 → 1993.58] If we believe now,
[1994.10 → 1995.06] then on that day,
[1995.14 → 1996.42] we will be glorified with him.
[1996.42 → 1999.26] But Paul isn't done.
[2000.24 → 2001.34] In verses 11-12,
[2001.58 → 2003.64] Paul ties the two-part promise
[2003.64 → 2005.60] to prayer and God's faithfulness.
[2006.28 → 2007.96] He prays that by the power of God,
[2008.10 → 2011.16] they may be made worthy of God's calling,
[2011.54 → 2012.72] and that their desires for goodness
[2012.72 → 2014.38] and their works may be prompted by faith.
[2015.12 → 2017.22] This is where the relief today comes from.
[2017.90 → 2019.14] The way this church,
[2019.28 → 2020.26] and churches everywhere,
[2020.74 → 2022.48] the hands and feet of Jesus,
[2023.12 → 2024.76] bring relief to his people.
[2024.76 → 2027.40] Through faith in their faithful Saviour,
[2027.94 → 2030.20] this church can be that promised relief.
[2030.74 → 2032.28] Is that promised relief.
[2032.78 → 2033.90] And it is his power
[2033.90 → 2034.90] and the prayers of the church
[2034.90 → 2035.70] that fuel this.
[2036.64 → 2037.88] Look at D and Mark today.
[2038.88 → 2040.96] Their testimony of the faith of this church
[2040.96 → 2042.90] and their faith towards you.
[2044.56 → 2045.96] That's our relief today.
[2047.14 → 2048.52] And because of that faith,
[2048.72 → 2051.00] we have that promise on that final day.
[2052.30 → 2053.74] Remember, two parts.
[2055.22 → 2056.14] Langley, Emmanuel,
[2056.82 → 2058.26] as we go from this place
[2058.26 → 2059.64] with this in mind,
[2060.30 → 2061.60] may we constantly pray
[2061.60 → 2063.34] that our God may make us worthy
[2063.34 → 2063.94] of this calling,
[2064.76 → 2065.68] and that by his power,
[2065.80 → 2066.84] we may bring to fruition
[2066.84 → 2069.04] our every desire for goodness
[2069.04 → 2071.56] and our deeds prompted by faith.
[2072.38 → 2073.68] Let us pray so that the name
[2073.68 → 2075.08] of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2075.08 → 2076.24] may be glorified in us
[2076.24 → 2077.26] and us in him,
[2078.40 → 2079.92] according to the grace of our God
[2079.92 → 2081.12] and Lord Jesus Christ.
[2081.12 → 2083.10] On that day,
[2083.86 → 2085.70] that great and terrible day,
[2086.08 → 2087.98] when we are before the throne of God,
[2088.56 → 2090.54] we won't just receive
[2090.54 → 2092.16] a promise of life to come.
[2092.76 → 2094.96] We will receive the eternal life
[2094.96 → 2096.96] that he has been promising
[2096.96 → 2098.74] this whole time.
[2100.10 → 2102.64] Revealing it slowly through history.
[2103.68 → 2104.82] Revealing it to us.
[2104.82 → 2105.28] Revealing it to us.
[2105.28 → 2105.90] Uncovering it
[2105.90 → 2107.46] in God's revelation,
[2107.88 → 2108.90] in his apocalypse.
[2110.98 → 2112.48] In the apocalypse,
[2113.24 → 2113.80] this book,
[2114.44 → 2116.00] we have relief today
[2116.00 → 2118.08] and hope in eternity.
[2120.28 → 2121.00] Let's pray.
[2121.00 → 2124.86] God,
[2124.94 → 2125.84] thank you for this day.
[2127.02 → 2128.24] Thank you for the way
[2128.24 → 2130.38] this church loves each other
[2130.38 → 2131.70] and the world around us.
[2132.42 → 2133.62] For the way that we've taken
[2133.62 → 2134.60] the opportunity to help
[2134.60 → 2136.80] the prisoners in chains
[2136.80 → 2138.58] and the way that we've helped
[2138.58 → 2139.72] the poor.
[2140.62 → 2141.70] The way that we've helped each other
[2141.70 → 2143.10] in various ways.
[2143.32 → 2143.68] I pray, Lord,
[2143.70 → 2144.76] that we would continue to do so
[2144.76 → 2145.68] and that you,
[2146.20 → 2146.74] through this prayer,
[2146.84 → 2148.12] would continue to empower us
[2148.12 → 2149.84] to do all this.
[2149.84 → 2151.18] You have given Your Holy Spirit,
[2151.34 → 2151.44] Lord,
[2151.48 → 2152.60] and I pray that we would continue
[2152.60 → 2153.58] to glorify You
[2153.58 → 2154.90] now and forever.
[2155.36 → 2155.64] Amen.
[2155.64 → 2155.74] Amen.
[2179.84 → 2187.84] As in assurance,
[2189.34 → 2190.84] Jesus is mine.
[2192.12 → 2194.18] Oh, what a forte
[2194.18 → 2196.84] of glory divine.
[2197.96 → 2200.00] Heir of salvation,
[2200.84 → 2203.10] purchase of God.
[2203.10 → 2205.76] Lord of His Spirit,
[2206.54 → 2208.78] washed in His blood.
[2208.78 → 2211.54] This is my story,
[2212.22 → 2214.52] this is my song,

[2231.64 → 2235.08] perfect submission,
[2235.08 → 2237.90] perfect divine,
[2237.90 → 2240.08] visions of rapture,
[2241.08 → 2243.56] numbers of my sight,
[2243.98 → 2246.02] angels descending,
[2246.90 → 2249.00] great from above,
[2249.56 → 2251.60] echoes of mercy,
[2252.48 → 2254.62] whispers of love.

[2268.42 → 2271.42] this is my song,
[2271.42 → 2274.02] praising my Saviour
[2274.02 → 2277.24] all the day long.
[2277.24 → 2280.68] perfect submission,
[2280.68 → 2283.80] all is at rest,
[2283.80 → 2286.36] high in my Saviour,
[2287.08 → 2289.42] happy and blessed,
[2289.42 → 2292.08] watching and waiting,
[2292.90 → 2295.04] looking above,
[2295.52 → 2297.80] filled with His goodness,
[2298.52 → 2300.66] lost in His love.
[2300.78 → 2303.32] This is my story,

[2340.78 → 2347.08] Praising my Saviour all the day long
[2347.08 → 2359.88] I'm so worried about my sermon this morning that I forgot to get an announcement in
[2359.88 → 2361.46] So, quickly before the blessing
[2361.46 → 2364.94] Young adults, if you didn't receive the email, there's a meeting after church
[2364.94 → 2366.80] Ten minutes after, in the multipurpose room
[2366.80 → 2369.42] But, the blessing of the Lord
[2369.42 → 2372.76] The Lord bless you and keep you
