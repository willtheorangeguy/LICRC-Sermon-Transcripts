• The distinction between dogma and living truth about a living God
• The role of the preacher in proclaiming the Lord's words and not relying on opinions or entertainment
• The need for sound doctrine to lead to lived discipleship and a relationship with Jesus Christ
• Jesus turns to his disciples and asks if they will run away too after others have fled.
• Peter responds by saying that they should go where Jesus is because he has the words of eternal life.
• The preacher's task is not to soften or make truth easier, but to proclaim Christ until hearts burn with understanding.
