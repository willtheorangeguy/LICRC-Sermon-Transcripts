[1855.60 → 1860.60] Happy now Now Skip
[1860.60 → 1874.60] When striving seems my comforter, my all in all, here in the love of Christ I stand.
[1874.60 → 1892.60] In Christ alone, who took on flesh, fullness of God in helpless faith,
[1892.60 → 1903.00] this gift of love and righteousness, scorned by the ones he came to save.
[1903.00 → 1912.50] Till on that cross, as Jesus died, the wrath of God was satisfied.
[1912.50 → 1923.76] For every sin on him was laid, here in the death of Christ I live.
[1933.00 → 1942.50] There in the ground his body lay, light of the world by darkness slain.
[1942.50 → 1952.50] Then bursting forth in glorious day, up from the grave he rose again.
[1952.50 → 1962.50] And as he stands in victory, sin's curse has lost its grip on me.
[1962.50 → 1973.50] For I am his, and he is mine, bought with the precious blood of Christ.
[1973.50 → 1992.50] No guilt in life, no fear in death, this is the power of Christ in me.
[1992.50 → 2002.00] From life's first cry to final breath, Jesus commands my destiny.
[2002.00 → 2012.00] No power of hell, no scheme of man, can ever pluck me from his hand.
[2012.00 → 2022.00] Till he returns, or calls me home, here in the power of Christ I'll stand.
[2022.00 → 2033.38] No power of hell, no scheme of man, can ever pluck me from his hand.
[2033.38 → 2042.36] Till he returns, or calls me home, here in the power of Christ I'll stand.
[2042.36 → 2043.36] I'll stand.
[2071.14 → 2072.24] Good morning.
[2072.24 → 2078.16] My name is Allison, and I am one of the deacons here at the church.
[2078.16 → 2085.74] Before I get into the offerings for today, I just have a quick update about Jody and
[2085.74 → 2089.28] Uriel in Mexico.
[2089.28 → 2095.28] You heard last week about the situation with their property that they're moving to, the
[2095.28 → 2098.96] flood that wiped out a retaining wall.
[2098.96 → 2103.16] They need to rebuild that wall before they can move there.
[2103.16 → 2109.00] So they are able to stay where they are for now.
[2109.00 → 2115.96] There are plans for excavation and rebuilding and equipment.
[2115.96 → 2121.78] Things are underway about bringing equipment.
[2121.78 → 2126.32] And of course, the work and the equipment need finances.
[2126.32 → 2134.72] So the church would love to help in some way to ease that burden for them through their organization,
[2134.72 → 2136.88] C10.
[2136.88 → 2144.20] So stay tuned for more information, which will be coming out hopefully this week in an email
[2144.20 → 2148.38] with more details on how you can help.
[2148.38 → 2154.10] So today's offering, as well as just the running of the church and all the bills that have to
[2154.10 → 2165.98] be paid for that, we are, I'm speaking on behalf of our benevolence fund, which the deacons have
[2165.98 → 2170.30] charge of, that's not quite the right term, but we manage that fund.
[2170.30 → 2178.02] And we are able to assist people in our congregation and in the community who need some help at various
[2178.02 → 2180.28] times of their lives.
[2180.28 → 2185.10] We have some new needs that have come up lately.
[2185.10 → 2189.42] So please give generously as the Lord has given to you.
[2189.42 → 2190.46] Thank you very much.
[2208.02 → 2238.00] Thank you very much.
[2238.02 → 2268.00] Thank you very much.

[2298.02 → 2299.02] Thank you.
[2299.02 → 2300.02] Thank you very much.
[2300.02 → 2305.02] Thank you.
[2305.02 → 2309.02] Thank you.
[2309.02 → 2314.02] Thank you.
[2314.02 → 2316.02] Thank you.
[2316.02 → 2326.02] Thank you.
[2326.02 → 2328.02] Thank you.
[2328.02 → 2330.02] Thank you.
[2330.02 → 2335.66] And a light unto my path.
[2336.42 → 2341.44] Thy word is a lamp unto my feet.
[2341.44 → 2347.26] And a light unto my path.
[2347.58 → 2353.40] You're the light unto my path.
[2360.02 → 2371.14] Can I have all the Children's Worship Time kids up front, please?
[2384.18 → 2385.40] Fine looking bunch.
[2385.48 → 2385.98] Good morning.
[2385.98 → 2386.04] Good morning.
[2388.88 → 2392.36] I know I'm one of the older guys up here that does this, and my hearing's not so good.
[2392.40 → 2394.46] Do you think you guys can say good morning a little louder for me?
[2394.52 → 2394.96] Good morning.
[2395.36 → 2396.26] Good morning.
[2396.92 → 2398.02] Very, very good.
[2398.40 → 2399.28] Wow, that's good.
[2399.34 → 2399.88] That's great.
[2401.18 → 2402.74] How are you guys all doing?
[2403.60 → 2403.92] Good.
[2404.74 → 2406.62] Well, I've been away from this for about a year.
[2406.68 → 2410.98] I took a little bit of a break, so I'm back again, so I get to see you guys a bit more.
[2411.04 → 2412.40] So that's going to be exciting for me.
[2412.40 → 2417.76] Today, the big people in the church are going to be talking about in, Pastor Chris is going
[2417.76 → 2422.24] to preach on Ecclesiastes 3, and it's talking about a time for everything.
[2424.88 → 2426.38] And a time for other things.
[2426.52 → 2427.96] So let me ask you a question.
[2428.06 → 2430.14] Is it good that you guys sleep all the time?
[2431.26 → 2434.56] So is it a good time to wake up and kind of go to school and do stuff?
[2434.60 → 2435.74] You want to sleep all the time?
[2436.12 → 2437.02] You like sleeping?
[2437.44 → 2437.98] That's good.
[2437.98 → 2440.66] I like sleeping too, but sometimes I get tired.
[2441.28 → 2442.58] Sometimes you get tired of sleeping?
[2443.40 → 2443.96] That's good.
[2444.64 → 2445.36] Well, guess what?
[2445.42 → 2447.10] Does anybody know what the seasons are?
[2447.28 → 2449.08] Does anybody know anything about seasons?
[2449.30 → 2450.60] What season are we in right now?
[2450.66 → 2451.10] Does anybody know?
[2451.14 → 2451.30] Yeah.
[2452.80 → 2453.42] Not quite.
[2453.48 → 2454.18] What season are we in?
[2454.66 → 2454.98] Fall.
[2455.98 → 2458.40] So this is a good example of there's a time for everything.
[2458.50 → 2459.50] There's a time for fall.
[2459.62 → 2460.56] There's a time for winter.
[2460.80 → 2461.90] There's a time for spring.
[2462.04 → 2464.70] And there's a time for summer.
[2465.20 → 2468.00] I want to do a pop-up poll with the congregation here.
[2468.10 → 2470.76] Who in this group right here amongst the kids likes winter?
[2471.14 → 2471.78] I need a volunteer.
[2472.00 → 2472.56] Who likes winter?
[2472.88 → 2474.06] Can you come up front for me?
[2474.94 → 2475.26] All right.
[2475.78 → 2477.74] Can you stand up top there on the thing?
[2477.86 → 2480.00] Who likes fall?
[2480.24 → 2481.06] It's one of my favourite.
[2481.18 → 2482.18] You want to be fall?
[2482.26 → 2482.88] You can go up front.
[2484.76 → 2486.20] I got a winter guy already.
[2486.30 → 2487.24] Do you want?
[2487.24 → 2488.62] I need a spring person.
[2489.04 → 2489.84] Do you want to be spring?
[2489.84 → 2492.46] And which one am I missing?
[2492.62 → 2493.24] I got winter.
[2493.86 → 2495.24] I need a summer person.
[2495.40 → 2496.24] The kids got a love.
[2496.30 → 2497.00] You want to be summer?
[2497.32 → 2497.88] Go up front.
[2499.24 → 2499.70] Okay.
[2499.74 → 2501.92] We're going to test the congregation right now.
[2502.14 → 2507.34] We're going to find out who in this congregation likes what season the best.
[2507.48 → 2508.52] You're my what guy?
[2509.20 → 2509.54] Winter.
[2509.78 → 2511.02] Who here likes winter?
[2511.24 → 2512.10] Put your hand up.
[2513.12 → 2513.56] Oh.
[2514.84 → 2518.24] A lot of the gray hairs, I think they escape winter, go down south.
[2518.24 → 2521.54] What season were you?
[2521.78 → 2523.34] I think it was spring.
[2523.82 → 2524.30] Spring.
[2524.42 → 2525.64] Who likes spring here?
[2526.18 → 2527.28] Oh, more hands.
[2527.36 → 2528.52] There's more spring likers.
[2529.64 → 2532.90] What do you like?
[2534.52 → 2535.00] Yeah.
[2540.28 → 2541.20] You're going to be fall.
[2542.76 → 2543.34] Here's fall.
[2543.40 → 2543.96] Who likes fall?
[2544.08 → 2544.34] Oh, no.
[2544.38 → 2545.34] We just did fall, didn't we?
[2545.74 → 2546.80] Or this one's fall.
[2547.04 → 2547.32] Okay.
[2547.40 → 2548.60] I'm getting all confused now.
[2548.64 → 2549.86] You guys all messed me up.
[2550.02 → 2551.96] You guys screen your fall.
[2552.02 → 2552.70] We need a summer.
[2552.80 → 2553.10] Who likes?
[2553.14 → 2554.02] Who's my summer person?
[2554.10 → 2554.56] You were summer.
[2554.64 → 2555.68] Who likes summer here?
[2555.80 → 2557.60] Oh, we got lots of summers.
[2558.32 → 2560.66] And I think the last one is fall, right?
[2561.40 → 2562.52] Who likes fall here?
[2563.30 → 2563.84] All right.
[2563.96 → 2564.72] Oh, fall's good.
[2565.20 → 2565.52] Okay.
[2565.66 → 2566.74] Can you guys come on down?
[2567.42 → 2568.90] We're going to do the blessing now.
[2568.98 → 2569.92] Can you guys stand up?
[2569.92 → 2571.82] And we're going to do the blessing.
[2574.86 → 2577.14] You guys don't know how to do this nice and loud for me.
[2577.88 → 2578.24] Ready?
[2578.98 → 2579.26] The.
[2579.62 → 2581.96] The Lord be with you.
[2582.20 → 2583.90] And also be with you.
[2599.92 → 2609.72] Hi.
[2610.52 → 2625.60] I'm an elder here at Emmanuel.
[2625.60 → 2632.04] My name is Clary, and I'm going to lead us in our church family prayer.
[2633.10 → 2637.92] There are a couple of announcements first that I want to share with you.
[2639.76 → 2646.60] Second reminder to come and join us this Wednesday night, October the 29th,
[2647.52 → 2651.56] during Game 5 of the World Series for Kevin's ordination service.
[2653.30 → 2654.50] We'll see you here.
[2655.60 → 2657.92] And we'll leave our phones out there.
[2659.30 → 2663.68] It's also budget planning season for 2026.
[2664.08 → 2667.20] We pray for the support of our ministry and missions,
[2667.42 → 2675.40] as well as the spirits leading for what God will do amongst us and with us over the next year.
[2676.40 → 2678.50] Remember Marilyn and the church office.
[2679.40 → 2680.80] Remember the finance committee.
[2680.80 → 2685.02] And remember council as we discern together.
[2685.02 → 2691.88] And just an item for you to remember in your prayers going forward.
[2692.94 → 2695.18] The meetings of classes were held last week.
[2695.82 → 2703.00] And our request is that you would remember to pray that God would bless the work done
[2703.00 → 2706.72] in all the different churches which are involved.
[2706.72 → 2713.04] Let's come to our Father in prayer.
[2717.76 → 2724.34] Our gracious Father in Heaven, we want to give thanks to you this morning that we can be here.
[2724.34 → 2729.52] Thank you that we may begin our week not at work,
[2730.20 → 2734.76] not racing to put food on the table,
[2734.84 → 2741.80] but that we may express our faith in you by putting everything aside
[2741.80 → 2744.88] and beginning the week resting.
[2744.88 → 2747.30] Thank you for this gift.
[2747.30 → 2757.14] And forgive us when we don't really pay attention to this rhythm, and we take it for granted.
[2757.68 → 2761.08] May we be always grateful for this.
[2761.08 → 2764.00] We want to thank you too, Lord.
[2765.46 → 2768.22] When we realize that in all the universe,
[2769.74 → 2770.96] as far as we can tell,
[2771.18 → 2773.16] every single thing out there,
[2773.52 → 2775.00] living and inanimate,
[2775.80 → 2776.32] follows
[2776.32 → 2779.60] the rules that you have put in place.
[2780.62 → 2782.42] Raindrops are a predictable size.
[2782.42 → 2785.18] Fog is always the same.
[2785.74 → 2786.14] Gravity,
[2786.64 → 2787.46] as far as we can tell,
[2787.54 → 2788.26] doesn't change.
[2788.74 → 2790.30] Light waves do their job.
[2790.82 → 2794.02] The leaves on the trees outside follow a pretty predictable pattern.
[2795.24 → 2797.56] The animals follow their instincts.
[2799.58 → 2800.88] And then there's us.
[2801.30 → 2801.52] We
[2801.52 → 2804.14] have free will.
[2805.70 → 2806.86] And this is amazing.
[2809.08 → 2810.02] So thank you
[2810.02 → 2812.64] that in your wisdom
[2812.64 → 2814.72] and in your desire to
[2814.72 → 2816.18] love us
[2816.18 → 2817.98] and be loved by us,
[2818.58 → 2819.40] you have
[2819.40 → 2821.80] placed an awful lot
[2821.80 → 2823.08] of responsibility
[2823.08 → 2825.64] into our hands.
[2826.76 → 2827.24] And
[2827.24 → 2830.22] we can choose
[2830.22 → 2831.00] to be here.
[2831.12 → 2831.64] We can choose
[2831.64 → 2832.42] to not be here.
[2832.94 → 2834.86] All life is full of choices.
[2835.98 → 2836.36] And
[2836.36 → 2838.60] we thank you for this
[2838.60 → 2839.48] and we ask
[2839.48 → 2840.72] that we may
[2840.72 → 2842.88] as we
[2842.88 → 2844.12] are faced
[2844.12 → 2844.82] every day
[2844.82 → 2845.82] with decision-making
[2845.82 → 2847.34] that we may
[2847.34 → 2848.26] humbly
[2848.26 → 2850.74] offer our lives
[2850.74 → 2851.40] up to you
[2851.40 → 2853.88] and
[2853.88 → 2854.72] allow you
[2854.72 → 2855.80] and your spirit
[2855.80 → 2856.30] to be
[2856.30 → 2856.76] working
[2856.76 → 2857.60] in us.
[2861.82 → 2862.76] This week
[2862.76 → 2864.10] there are
[2864.10 → 2865.52] a handful of items
[2865.52 → 2865.80] that
[2865.80 → 2867.54] we would
[2867.54 → 2868.08] like to
[2868.08 → 2869.06] specifically
[2869.06 → 2870.76] raise up
[2870.76 → 2871.40] to you.
[2872.36 → 2873.16] First,
[2873.92 → 2874.70] we want to give you
[2874.70 → 2875.80] thanks that
[2875.80 → 2877.24] Nate and Haley Kickoff
[2877.24 → 2879.12] had a baby girl.
[2879.54 → 2880.42] Her name is Ruth
[2880.42 → 2881.10] and
[2881.10 → 2882.70] all is well.
[2884.58 → 2884.98] And of course,
[2885.06 → 2885.64] Stacy and I
[2885.64 → 2886.56] and Nate's parents
[2886.56 → 2887.22] are quite excited
[2887.22 → 2888.18] because this is
[2888.18 → 2889.34] a first grand baby
[2889.34 → 2890.32] for both families.
[2890.32 → 2892.46] bless them
[2892.46 → 2892.92] in this
[2892.92 → 2894.58] couple weeks
[2894.58 → 2895.32] of transition
[2895.32 → 2896.50] and
[2896.50 → 2898.04] continue to
[2898.04 → 2898.74] give health.
[2899.76 → 2900.50] We want to give you
[2900.50 → 2900.92] thanks
[2900.92 → 2901.92] that
[2901.92 → 2904.50] Kevin's exam
[2904.50 → 2905.18] at classes
[2905.18 → 2906.40] went well
[2906.40 → 2907.24] this past week
[2907.24 → 2908.10] and that he can
[2908.10 → 2909.06] now be ordained.
[2910.06 → 2911.34] We want to
[2911.34 → 2912.22] ask that you
[2912.22 → 2913.18] please
[2913.18 → 2913.96] continue to
[2913.96 → 2914.88] provide healing
[2914.88 → 2916.24] and patience
[2916.24 → 2917.26] for my sister
[2917.26 → 2917.88] Carolyn.
[2919.90 → 2920.94] She has a long
[2920.94 → 2921.92] road of recovery
[2921.92 → 2923.44] but she is
[2923.44 → 2923.98] recovering
[2923.98 → 2925.28] but it's going
[2925.28 → 2925.70] to be
[2925.70 → 2926.78] probably
[2926.78 → 2927.92] the new year
[2927.92 → 2928.58] before she can
[2928.58 → 2929.14] put weight
[2929.14 → 2929.78] on her foot.
[2930.60 → 2930.72] So
[2930.72 → 2932.48] mend her
[2932.48 → 2933.26] broken foot
[2933.26 → 2933.98] mend her
[2933.98 → 2935.48] broken back
[2935.48 → 2936.26] and ribs
[2936.26 → 2937.00] and
[2937.00 → 2938.18] especially
[2938.18 → 2940.98] give her
[2940.98 → 2941.56] good cheer.
[2942.62 → 2943.30] We also
[2943.30 → 2943.66] want to say
[2943.66 → 2944.08] thank you
[2944.08 → 2945.02] that Tessa's
[2945.02 → 2945.72] lungs
[2945.72 → 2946.82] have improved
[2946.82 → 2948.54] quite a bit
[2948.54 → 2949.32] and that she is
[2949.32 → 2949.68] doing
[2949.68 → 2950.66] very well.
[2952.38 → 2953.38] We want to
[2953.38 → 2953.92] ask that you
[2953.92 → 2954.66] continue to
[2954.66 → 2955.06] strengthen
[2955.06 → 2956.48] expecting mothers
[2956.48 → 2958.16] and
[2958.16 → 2959.30] for all of those
[2959.30 → 2960.28] in our midst
[2960.28 → 2960.74] who are
[2960.74 → 2961.92] foster parents
[2961.92 → 2963.14] please
[2963.14 → 2963.86] bless their
[2963.86 → 2964.36] families
[2964.36 → 2966.08] and give them
[2966.08 → 2967.78] a full measure
[2967.78 → 2968.30] of grace
[2968.30 → 2969.08] and joy
[2969.08 → 2970.52] in the work
[2970.52 → 2971.24] that they do
[2971.24 → 2973.04] whether it is
[2973.04 → 2973.90] for a short term
[2973.90 → 2975.18] or long term.
[2978.46 → 2979.26] We also
[2979.26 → 2980.62] realize
[2980.62 → 2981.78] that in many
[2981.78 → 2982.50] of our families
[2982.50 → 2982.86] there are
[2982.86 → 2983.44] strained
[2983.44 → 2983.80] and maybe
[2983.80 → 2984.20] even
[2984.20 → 2984.74] broken
[2984.74 → 2985.84] relationships.
[2986.84 → 2987.44] There's a lot
[2987.44 → 2987.78] of blame
[2987.78 → 2988.54] to go around
[2988.54 → 2989.72] to be sure
[2989.72 → 2991.86] but we ask
[2991.86 → 2992.26] that you help
[2992.26 → 2992.98] us to remember
[2992.98 → 2994.02] that love
[2994.02 → 2995.24] can be a lot
[2995.24 → 2995.62] of work
[2995.62 → 2997.18] and that time
[2997.18 → 2997.68] is precious
[2997.68 → 2998.60] and that we are
[2998.60 → 2999.50] not promised
[2999.50 → 3000.32] a tomorrow
[3000.32 → 3001.80] and that maybe
[3001.80 → 3002.24] it's time
[3002.24 → 3002.70] to make that
[3002.70 → 3003.52] awkward call
[3003.52 → 3004.24] or have that
[3004.24 → 3004.84] conversation
[3004.84 → 3005.38] that we've
[3005.38 → 3005.86] been avoiding.
[3006.86 → 3007.98] In all cases
[3007.98 → 3008.32] Lord,
[3008.58 → 3009.36] grant courage
[3009.36 → 3010.98] and grace
[3010.98 → 3014.54] and in those
[3014.54 → 3015.64] circumstances
[3015.64 → 3016.44] will you bring
[3016.44 → 3017.92] reconciliation?
[3017.92 → 3020.74] and finally
[3020.74 → 3022.16] and this is a big
[3022.16 → 3022.58] ask
[3022.58 → 3023.64] but we ask
[3023.64 → 3025.02] for more
[3025.02 → 3026.26] peace in the world.
[3028.20 → 3029.26] I googled this
[3029.26 → 3029.58] morning
[3029.58 → 3030.56] and almost every
[3030.56 → 3031.22] letter of the
[3031.22 → 3031.56] alphabet
[3031.56 → 3033.42] has a country
[3033.42 → 3034.94] that has a war
[3034.94 → 3035.52] going on
[3035.52 → 3035.92] in it.
[3037.20 → 3037.88] Israel,
[3038.24 → 3038.62] Ukraine,
[3038.78 → 3039.22] Afghanistan,
[3039.56 → 3039.80] Haiti,
[3040.32 → 3041.32] the list goes on
[3041.32 → 3044.22] and Father
[3044.22 → 3044.80] we ask
[3044.80 → 3046.78] that leaders
[3046.78 → 3047.68] in these
[3047.68 → 3048.28] conflicts
[3048.28 → 3051.28] may be
[3051.28 → 3052.00] greatly moved
[3052.00 → 3053.14] by your spirit
[3053.14 → 3053.70] through their
[3053.70 → 3054.22] advisors
[3054.22 → 3054.92] or through
[3054.92 → 3055.44] dreams
[3055.44 → 3057.22] and that they
[3057.22 → 3057.76] may seek
[3057.76 → 3060.96] to make
[3060.96 → 3061.96] real peace.
[3063.32 → 3064.18] We know
[3064.18 → 3064.98] this is possible.
[3065.82 → 3066.28] Honestly,
[3066.62 → 3067.46] I think a lot
[3067.46 → 3068.30] of us wonder
[3068.30 → 3070.82] if it's doable
[3070.82 → 3072.80] so we ask
[3072.80 → 3073.18] that you
[3073.18 → 3074.04] and your Holy Spirit
[3074.04 → 3074.64] may work
[3074.64 → 3075.52] mightily
[3075.52 → 3075.98] through your
[3075.98 → 3076.40] church
[3076.40 → 3079.32] to bring
[3079.32 → 3079.84] restoration
[3079.84 → 3080.54] and justice.
[3081.74 → 3082.34] Amen.
[3100.82 → 3112.14] Let me try
[3112.14 → 3112.40] again.
[3112.54 → 3112.88] Thank you
[3112.88 → 3113.52] OPA Clary
[3113.52 → 3114.02] for that
[3114.02 → 3114.34] prayer.
[3116.42 → 3117.24] We are
[3117.24 → 3118.10] going to
[3118.10 → 3119.26] at this time
[3119.26 → 3120.34] open God's
[3120.34 → 3120.96] word together
[3120.96 → 3122.76] and spend
[3122.76 → 3123.46] some time
[3123.46 → 3124.10] reflecting
[3124.10 → 3124.82] on
[3124.82 → 3126.50] Ecclesiastes
[3126.50 → 3127.10] 3.
[3128.14 → 3128.60] I'm going to
[3128.60 → 3129.12] read the
[3129.12 → 3130.60] first 15
[3130.60 → 3131.06] verses
[3131.06 → 3132.72] in our
[3132.72 → 3133.20] time
[3133.20 → 3134.28] together
[3134.28 → 3134.60] at the
[3134.60 → 3134.88] beginning.
[3135.68 → 3136.24] I invite
[3136.24 → 3136.74] you to
[3136.74 → 3137.34] have that
[3137.34 → 3137.98] open in
[3137.98 → 3138.28] front of
[3138.28 → 3138.60] you or
[3138.60 → 3138.84] on a
[3138.84 → 3139.24] device
[3139.24 → 3140.28] with you
[3140.28 → 3141.36] as we
[3141.36 → 3142.30] read together
[3142.30 → 3142.66] and then
[3142.66 → 3142.98] to keep
[3142.98 → 3143.44] that there
[3143.44 → 3144.08] as we
[3144.08 → 3144.46] reflect
[3144.46 → 3144.86] back
[3144.86 → 3145.72] throughout.
[3147.10 → 3147.70] Let's
[3147.70 → 3148.34] read from
[3148.34 → 3149.12] Ecclesiastes
[3149.12 → 3149.50] 3.
[3151.72 → 3152.48] There is
[3152.48 → 3153.06] a time
[3153.06 → 3153.64] for
[3153.64 → 3154.34] everything
[3154.34 → 3155.42] and a
[3155.42 → 3155.74] season
[3155.74 → 3156.60] for every
[3156.60 → 3157.16] activity
[3157.16 → 3157.90] under
[3157.90 → 3186.12] the
[3186.12 → 3188.24] A time to search and a time to give up.
[3188.32 → 3190.84] A time to keep and a time to throw away.
[3191.20 → 3193.76] A time to tear and a time to mend.
[3194.40 → 3197.46] A time to be silent and a time to speak.
[3198.16 → 3201.54] A time to love and a time to hate.
[3202.14 → 3205.24] A time for war and a time for peace.
[3206.54 → 3210.14] What do workers gain from all their toil?
[3210.14 → 3214.58] I have seen the burden God has laid on the human race.
[3214.58 → 3219.06] He has made everything beautiful in its time.
[3219.90 → 3222.96] And he has also set eternity in the heart.
[3224.18 → 3229.14] Yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end.
[3230.56 → 3237.20] I know that there is nothing better for people than to be happy and to do good while they live.
[3237.80 → 3243.14] That each of them may eat and drink and find satisfaction in all their toil.
[3243.14 → 3245.48] This is the gift of God.
[3246.68 → 3249.84] I know that everything God does will endure forever.
[3250.88 → 3254.18] Nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it.
[3254.76 → 3258.14] God does it so that people will fear him.
[3259.70 → 3265.26] Whatever is has been already and whatever will be had been before.
[3265.90 → 3269.32] And God will call the past to account.
[3269.32 → 3271.72] This is the word of the Lord.
[3278.92 → 3285.24] We live in an age that is obsessed with time.
[3285.24 → 3290.26] We count our steps.
[3291.38 → 3298.44] We strap little devices to our wrists in order to track just how many steps we've taken.
[3298.62 → 3302.96] Making sure that we hit our 12,000-step goal every single day.
[3303.12 → 3304.78] We track our sleep.
[3304.92 → 3311.88] We put little rings on that send a report on our sleep to us every morning after we wake up.
[3311.88 → 3314.44] So that we can see what we already know.
[3314.44 → 3316.80] That I didn't get enough sleep, and I'm still tired.
[3317.84 → 3320.14] We schedule every hour.
[3320.38 → 3322.44] We colour code our calendars.
[3322.58 → 3326.22] We fill every spare moment with noise.
[3327.22 → 3331.66] In our culture today, productivity is the new piety.
[3331.66 → 3338.08] The modern gospel promises salvation by optimization.
[3339.16 → 3343.38] If you can manage your time well enough, you can master your life.
[3345.38 → 3355.54] Beneath it all lies a truth, a longing, and honestly, a heartbreak.
[3355.54 → 3365.04] That no matter how carefully we plan, time keeps slipping through our fingers.
[3366.30 → 3367.70] The calendar fills.
[3368.00 → 3368.94] The children grow.
[3369.54 → 3370.90] The mirror changes.
[3371.52 → 3372.62] And we feel it.
[3373.82 → 3375.60] You are not in control.
[3377.80 → 3379.42] And so the search continues.
[3379.42 → 3385.82] If we can't master time through productivity, perhaps we can escape it through progress.
[3386.22 → 3391.78] And so we look to science or technology, to human innovation, hoping that that will somehow
[3391.78 → 3395.36] free us from the limits that bind us.
[3396.10 → 3402.50] We long to be timeless, free from decay, free from aging, from the brevity that defines every
[3402.50 → 3403.78] human moment.
[3403.78 → 3413.96] And we do this at a point in time in history when the banner that Friedrich Nietzsche once
[3413.96 → 3421.76] said, God is dead, is proclaimed not merely as a declaration of unbelief in the world, but
[3421.76 → 3424.80] an attempt to break free from divine limits.
[3425.90 → 3426.02] Right?
[3426.08 → 3431.94] If God is dead, then the human spirit can finally be sovereign over its own destiny.
[3431.94 → 3442.98] And yet, as the teacher in Ecclesiastes discovered long before Nietzsche, a world without God quickly
[3442.98 → 3445.10] becomes a world without meaning.
[3446.90 → 3454.72] Now down the line, from the philosophical work of the Enlightenment and thinkers like Immanuel Kant,
[3454.72 → 3463.32] emerges this distinction in the world between belief on one hand and knowledge on the other.
[3464.48 → 3466.96] Knowledge is empirical.
[3467.38 → 3468.46] It is verifiable.
[3468.78 → 3470.04] It is falsifiable.
[3470.62 → 3472.80] And belief is faith.
[3473.72 → 3474.58] It is assumption.
[3475.04 → 3476.88] It's ultimately unprovable.
[3476.88 → 3481.80] And therefore, they belong to different categories of thought.
[3482.76 → 3485.10] And they're weighted differently.
[3485.34 → 3493.66] And over time, this distinction has become a dichotomy that has hijacked religious language
[3493.66 → 3497.52] and thought and ideas to a lesser category.
[3499.20 → 3504.62] And sometimes even characterized as simple-minded or childish.
[3504.62 → 3514.86] And over here, modern science and post-Christian thought has trained us to see the world as if
[3514.86 → 3517.82] God were absent in it.
[3518.26 → 3525.70] To observe and to measure and to analyze without reference or account for his hand at work.
[3526.38 → 3531.22] And actually, even in the rise that we're seeing in the world today in a sort of contemporary
[3531.22 → 3541.60] spiritualism, the idea of God that people are returning to is a God who is part of the frame.
[3542.10 → 3545.14] A God who can be explained by those categories.
[3545.76 → 3550.50] And who therefore can be manipulated and adjusted and directed.
[3551.64 → 3554.24] But that's just not the God we see in the Bible.
[3554.24 → 3564.18] And this contrast and this way of this lens of seeing the world actually isn't new.
[3565.72 → 3572.96] In our text from Ecclesiastes 3 and in the whole of Ecclesiastes, this has been the method of the teacher.
[3573.14 → 3576.04] This has been his experiment throughout.
[3576.04 → 3585.38] He looks at the world under the sun, stripping away revelation to see what can be known by observation alone.
[3585.50 → 3590.42] And he studies life through what we might call that empirical lens.
[3590.64 → 3598.98] Measuring what he can see, testing what he can experience, and searching for meaning before his eyes or under the sun.
[3598.98 → 3606.92] And what we are seeing over and over and over again, and what we need to see in this present moment,
[3607.32 → 3612.60] is that God's providence rules all time.
[3613.32 → 3621.02] And so our task is not to master it, but to receive time with reverent joy.
[3621.10 → 3626.74] That's the banner for us this morning, that God's providence rules all time.
[3626.74 → 3632.52] And our task then is not to master it, but to receive it with reverent joy.
[3634.18 → 3643.86] So as the teacher surveys life under the sun, he discovers, really, what every age must discover.
[3645.08 → 3652.16] That there is a time for everything, but the times themselves are not ours to command.
[3652.16 → 3660.54] As the teacher surveys life under the sun, he sees that there is a time for everything and a season forever,
[3661.02 → 3663.28] every activity under heaven.
[3663.40 → 3668.36] And he observes life as it unfolds, birth and death, planting and uprooting,
[3668.58 → 3670.76] weeping and laughter, mourning and dancing.
[3671.68 → 3675.58] And everything seems to arrive on schedule.
[3675.58 → 3681.18] And yet, it's no schedule that we control.
[3682.96 → 3691.94] The lessons of human experience come and go, not by our willing, but by someone beyond us.
[3693.70 → 3697.50] But notice how he frames it.
[3697.50 → 3714.84] Do you see?
[3714.84 → 3719.88] This is a zero-sum enterprise here.
[3719.88 → 3724.96] If on the one there's a good thing, the next undoes it.
[3726.94 → 3730.52] The teacher is not romantic about this.
[3730.66 → 3732.02] This is the reality.
[3732.12 → 3736.10] He doesn't say, isn't it wonderful that everything has its time?
[3736.22 → 3740.76] He says, look, it happens, and I can't change it.
[3741.50 → 3744.96] And in the end, what difference does it make?
[3744.96 → 3750.22] Can a person alter the day that they were born or the hour that they die?
[3751.22 → 3758.20] Can anyone force spring to come earlier or delay winter's rain and cold?
[3759.72 → 3763.28] Try as we might, these times are set.
[3764.18 → 3768.64] And we live in them, but we don't determine them.
[3768.64 → 3773.08] And so, again, the teacher asks the question.
[3773.22 → 3777.40] That has been a frame and a return and a reframe through the whole book.
[3777.84 → 3781.08] What does the worker gain from his toil?
[3782.26 → 3788.32] If life runs on a schedule that we don't write, what's the point of all our effort, all our striving, all our planning?
[3789.94 → 3797.22] And he looks out, and again, he realizes that in every pair in the poem, that it cancels the next out.
[3797.22 → 3800.20] For every action, there is its opposite.
[3800.44 → 3802.34] For every gain, it is undone.
[3802.48 → 3805.48] The ledger balances to nil.
[3806.68 → 3809.12] And this is what he sees under the sun.
[3809.84 → 3814.80] A world moving in circles, accomplishing nothing that lasts.
[3815.20 → 3820.08] As he said earlier, and we looked at this, a generation goes and a generation comes.
[3820.56 → 3822.46] The sun rises and the sun sets.
[3822.58 → 3824.98] The wind blows to the south and then turns to the north.
[3825.10 → 3826.74] Round and round it goes.
[3826.74 → 3827.92] There is no gain.
[3828.06 → 3829.42] There is no surplus.
[3829.74 → 3834.26] Time marches on indifferent to our labours.
[3836.76 → 3838.26] And I think we feel this.
[3840.26 → 3844.52] We want to stand outside of time and to master it.
[3845.06 → 3846.72] To make it serve our purposes.
[3846.72 → 3856.06] On Friday, at 4.30, I was sitting in my study, and I said, I need eight more hours.
[3856.06 → 3861.68] And I wanted to get home and watch the baseball game.
[3863.68 → 3864.92] But I didn't have it.
[3864.92 → 3865.92] We can't control it.
[3865.92 → 3867.08] Right?
[3867.08 → 3869.06] We can't control it.
[3869.86 → 3872.00] The seasons will not obey us.
[3872.44 → 3876.76] Our lives, for all of their activity, remain bounded to the same rhythm.
[3876.94 → 3878.08] Beginnings and endings.
[3878.08 → 3879.20] Joys and sorrows.
[3879.20 → 3880.56] Gain and loss.
[3880.56 → 3890.82] And when the teacher looks at the world through what can be known, through sight and through experience, through what can be measured,
[3890.82 → 3896.14] he finds no meaning there.
[3896.14 → 3903.08] And the more he looks, the more he observes, the more he discovers his own limits.
[3904.52 → 3906.12] He cannot master time.
[3907.06 → 3908.74] He can't even understand it.
[3908.74 → 3914.06] And in the end, we simply cannot fathom.
[3915.02 → 3916.42] We can't understand.
[3916.42 → 3928.14] And when we look at the world based purely on what we are able to know in that sort of empirical, scientific frame, we still don't understand.
[3929.90 → 3938.50] And yet, even in his unknowing, the teacher is not blind to beauty.
[3939.54 → 3939.66] Right?
[3939.70 → 3940.68] Did you catch that?
[3942.24 → 3943.20] Verse 11.
[3943.20 → 3948.68] He has made everything beautiful in its time.
[3950.32 → 3954.58] And though he cannot trace the pattern, he can see it shimmer.
[3955.58 → 3955.80] Right?
[3955.84 → 3961.54] There's a kind of order and a fittingness that breaks through the fog of human limitation.
[3961.54 → 3975.38] The seasons of joy and sorrow, birth and death, gain and loss, all have their place within a design that is too vast to comprehend, but too consistent to ignore.
[3975.38 → 3983.52] And again, as we're looking at Ecclesiastes, this is precisely where we introduce nuance.
[3984.72 → 3985.22] Right?
[3985.30 → 3988.94] The teacher here doesn't deny that beauty can be seen.
[3988.94 → 3993.12] He denies that the beauty can be explained.
[3994.12 → 3994.68] Right?
[3994.72 → 4000.82] The teacher cannot fathom the totality of God's work, and yet he perceives its beauty.
[4000.82 → 4008.12] In theological terms, this is the difference between comprehension and apprehension.
[4009.04 → 4009.18] Right?
[4009.22 → 4013.24] We cannot grasp the mystery, but we can glimpse the goodness.
[4014.36 → 4015.08] Right?
[4015.12 → 4020.26] We can perceive the artistry of God's providence without being able to diagram it.
[4020.26 → 4037.24] We can stand before time as we would a giant tapestry, catching only the underside of the threads, and yet, even from below, those glimpses of colour and form and pattern move us to wonder.
[4038.24 → 4043.66] To wonder, both in the sense of awe, but also in the sense of curiosity.
[4044.48 → 4046.14] What is going on here?
[4046.14 → 4052.88] And so already, right, within the futility, there is grace.
[4054.56 → 4066.48] Even as we cannot fathom what God has done from beginning to end, we sense that there is a purpose that makes life not meaningless, but mysteriously ordered.
[4067.86 → 4075.98] We see enough to trust, though we see enough also to know that we are not in control.
[4076.14 → 4083.18] And this distinction now, returning to that beginning one, of knowledge and belief isn't new.
[4083.60 → 4089.78] Long before modern philosophy named it, the teacher of Ecclesiastes is wrestling with it.
[4089.82 → 4096.48] And having looked at the world with his eyes alone, having found that knowledge by itself could not bear the weight of meaning,
[4096.48 → 4105.08] the more he measured, the less he understood, and yet even amidst the mystery, he saw the beauty.
[4106.62 → 4107.36] And so he turns.
[4108.64 → 4115.16] The teacher moves from describing what he sees to confessing what he knows.
[4115.16 → 4119.74] And the difference between the two is faith.
[4121.24 → 4122.40] In verse 12, he says,
[4122.80 → 4128.12] I know that there is nothing better than for people to be happy and to do good while they live.
[4128.68 → 4129.84] In verse 14, he says,
[4130.14 → 4133.68] I know that everything God does will endure forever.
[4135.38 → 4137.02] He can't prove any of those claims.
[4137.96 → 4140.12] They're not empirical conclusions.
[4140.12 → 4144.10] They are what we will call creedal affirmations.
[4145.20 → 4146.80] They're statements of belief.
[4147.62 → 4148.42] I believe.
[4148.80 → 4148.92] Right?
[4148.96 → 4153.10] So I know that there's nothing better than for people to be happy and do good while they live.
[4153.32 → 4153.68] Prove it.
[4154.96 → 4157.84] I know that everything God does will endure forever.
[4158.20 → 4158.60] Prove it.
[4159.72 → 4160.68] He can't do it.
[4160.68 → 4169.10] But he must believe them if life is going to have any coherence at all.
[4170.18 → 4170.28] Right?
[4170.36 → 4177.42] Without belief in God's enduring work, time collapses into endless cycles of gain and loss.
[4177.42 → 4187.76] But with belief in God's enduring work, with a recognition of God's providential hand over all creation, over all time,
[4188.06 → 4192.06] time itself becomes the theatre of God's providence.
[4193.76 → 4199.00] The teacher's confession anticipates our modern crisis.
[4200.30 → 4200.40] Right?
[4200.44 → 4205.30] We, too, live in an age and a time that prizes what can be measured and what can be verified.
[4205.30 → 4209.26] And we are trained to trust only what can be demonstrated.
[4209.52 → 4214.82] But meaning and goodness and beauty do not submit to laboratory instruments.
[4215.82 → 4223.22] The joy that the teacher describes cannot be observed so much as it can be only received.
[4224.76 → 4231.46] Faith, then, it turns out, doesn't replace knowledge, but rather completes it.
[4232.46 → 4233.16] Right?
[4233.16 → 4237.78] It allows what we see to become more than what we can explain.
[4238.80 → 4243.10] Belief opens our eyes to what reason alone cannot hold.
[4243.90 → 4250.72] And in the light of faith, that beauty glimpsed in time becomes a sign of the God who governs it.
[4250.72 → 4259.58] And then the reason we can find satisfaction in our toil, in our work, in our relationships, in the ordinary rhythms of life,
[4259.62 → 4266.32] is not because we have mastered time, but because we trust the one who holds time.
[4268.46 → 4268.64] Right?
[4269.04 → 4274.42] What we experience as fleeting, God holds forever.
[4274.42 → 4274.50] Whatever.
[4275.38 → 4284.64] What we feel as transient to us is purposeful to Him.
[4285.84 → 4291.14] He has made everything beautiful in its time.
[4291.28 → 4296.64] And He has made us to live in that beauty.
[4296.64 → 4299.86] To live with that joy.
[4299.86 → 4308.40] And the teacher's confession, as he builds, reaches the height of his argument in verse 14.
[4309.32 → 4309.68] He says,
[4309.68 → 4330.32] This is the turning point of our text, right?
[4330.32 → 4332.00] Human work is fleeting.
[4332.24 → 4334.10] God's work endures forever.
[4334.46 → 4336.52] Human striving cannot secure meaning.
[4336.94 → 4339.38] God's action provides meaning to all things.
[4339.68 → 4343.22] And the fear that the teacher names here is no terror.
[4343.78 → 4345.06] It is reverence.
[4345.64 → 4354.38] It is the stillness that comes when one realizes that the world is held by hands far stronger and wiser than our own.
[4354.38 → 4361.80] And so the proper posture in this recognition is not control, but worship.
[4363.08 → 4370.04] To live wisely is to learn how to rest in the limits of time and to rejoice in what God has given.
[4370.96 → 4377.04] There's nothing better, the teacher says, than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in all their toil.
[4377.54 → 4379.86] This is the gift of God.
[4379.86 → 4388.58] Joy in Ecclesiastes into the Christian is not a denial of reality.
[4388.76 → 4392.84] Joy is not the shallow optimism that pretends that everything is fine.
[4393.28 → 4399.86] Joy is a confession that even in our transience, God's providence is real.
[4400.70 → 4404.92] Even in our brokenness, God's power is true.
[4404.92 → 4412.08] Even in our incompleteness, God is whole and holy.
[4413.12 → 4421.46] And to rejoice is to trust that the beauty that we glimpse in our days and moments is not accidental, but full of purpose.
[4421.84 → 4429.96] And that behind the passing moments, there stands an eternal God who makes them beautiful in his time.
[4429.96 → 4439.64] And this kind of joy is deeply countercultural in the world today.
[4440.44 → 4447.22] We live in a world that is obsessed with control and optimization and with making the most of every moment.
[4447.42 → 4450.80] But the teacher's wisdom cuts through all of that.
[4450.80 → 4455.94] And he tells us that freedom is not found in mastering time, but in receiving it.
[4456.86 → 4459.18] The joy is not a reward for efficiency.
[4459.68 → 4462.66] It is the fruit of surrender.
[4464.02 → 4469.26] When we believe that God and everything God does endures forever,
[4469.46 → 4473.40] the pressure to secure our own permanence is released.
[4473.40 → 4480.68] We can live joyfully, freely, we can do generously and rest peacefully,
[4480.68 → 4486.12] because the end of all things does not depend on your work to secure it,
[4486.62 → 4493.40] but the eternal God who holds it and who holds us in his care.
[4494.54 → 4498.04] That is why the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,
[4498.40 → 4501.06] a refrain repeated throughout the book of Proverbs.
[4501.06 → 4503.96] Reverence anchors joy.
[4505.48 → 4510.98] Reverence anchors joy, and it keeps our gladness from becoming self-indulgence
[4510.98 → 4513.04] and turns it instead to gratitude.
[4514.02 → 4517.76] Every moment of joy then becomes a moment of worship.
[4518.82 → 4523.08] A quiet amen to the God whose work endures forever,
[4523.26 → 4528.08] whose timing is perfect, and whose beauty fills all things.
[4531.06 → 4542.06] Now the teacher, right, the teacher could only see the beauty of God and of time and of his plan in part.
[4543.16 → 4547.00] He knew that God makes all things beautiful in their time,
[4547.14 → 4550.06] but he couldn't yet see how.
[4550.06 → 4560.30] And it's ultimately the gospel that reveals the beauty of God fully in the person of Jesus Christ.
[4561.58 → 4565.04] David once prayed in Psalm 31 15,
[4565.48 → 4568.52] My times are in your hands.
[4570.00 → 4573.78] And in Christ, that prayer becomes flesh.
[4573.78 → 4577.78] Jesus entered time, entered our time,
[4577.78 → 4580.52] with all of its futility and frustration.
[4580.70 → 4582.68] And he lived the life that we should have lived.
[4583.32 → 4583.54] Right?
[4583.58 → 4586.56] One of perfect trust in the Father's timing.
[4588.24 → 4590.90] He never hurried God's purposes,
[4591.28 → 4595.38] never tried to seize control of what only the Father could give.
[4595.38 → 4600.10] And he died the death that we deserve.
[4601.14 → 4601.28] Right?
[4601.30 → 4606.52] The ultimate consequence of our striving to be our own masters of time.
[4607.48 → 4613.76] And at the cross, God's providence reaches its most paradoxical beauty.
[4614.44 → 4614.56] Right?
[4614.60 → 4620.80] What looked like the worst possible moment in time was, in fact, the best.
[4620.80 → 4620.92] Christ.
[4621.82 → 4624.16] As Paul writes in Romans 5, he says,
[4624.44 → 4629.36] You see, at just the right time, while we were still powerless,
[4629.90 → 4632.62] Christ died for the ungodly.
[4634.00 → 4639.62] The eternal plan of God met human history in one decisive act of love.
[4639.70 → 4642.16] And the one who holds all time in his hands
[4642.16 → 4647.28] entered time in order to redeem it and to secure you.
[4647.28 → 4653.46] The cross, then, is the ultimate answer to the teacher's struggle,
[4653.86 → 4654.90] to our struggle.
[4655.32 → 4660.52] Even when everything seems impossible,
[4660.78 → 4667.32] even when we cannot begin to grasp the meaning of anything that's going on,
[4667.60 → 4669.50] God is working.
[4670.44 → 4672.94] Even when everything looks senseless,
[4673.38 → 4675.28] God is weaving beauty.
[4675.28 → 4679.00] And the resurrection, in fact, confirms it.
[4679.74 → 4680.10] Right?
[4680.20 → 4681.72] There is a time to die,
[4682.34 → 4685.38] and there's a time to live again.
[4686.54 → 4689.66] Because of Jesus, we can now say with confidence
[4689.66 → 4691.32] what David only hoped.
[4691.74 → 4693.40] My times are in your hands.
[4694.28 → 4697.78] Every moment, every joy, every sorrow, every season
[4697.78 → 4701.68] is gathered into Christ's redemptive story,
[4701.68 → 4704.72] and his timing is not always our timing,
[4704.94 → 4707.58] but his timing is always good.
[4709.82 → 4713.00] And when the gospel grips our hearts,
[4713.56 → 4715.78] it changes how we see time.
[4716.52 → 4719.86] We no longer live as though the weight of the world depends on us.
[4720.66 → 4723.48] We confess that our time is God's time,
[4723.58 → 4725.44] that our money is God's money,
[4725.54 → 4727.32] that our church is his church,
[4727.32 → 4730.30] that our story is his story.
[4731.20 → 4735.08] To live in the fear of the Lord is to live with open hands,
[4735.38 → 4738.12] to receive each day as a gift,
[4738.26 → 4740.48] rather than grasping to control it.
[4741.12 → 4743.68] And this frees us to work diligently,
[4743.98 → 4746.18] to rest peacefully,
[4746.18 → 4748.52] and to rejoice sincerely.
[4748.52 → 4752.24] It teaches us to hold our achievements
[4752.24 → 4755.20] and our anxieties loosely.
[4756.44 → 4758.12] Because they belong to God,
[4758.82 → 4761.08] whose work endures forever.
[4762.12 → 4765.82] And this confession shapes every part of our life.
[4767.04 → 4768.54] When we plan our days,
[4768.68 → 4770.46] we do so humbly, saying,
[4770.84 → 4772.24] if the Lord wills.
[4772.26 → 4773.70] When we spend our time,
[4773.80 → 4775.32] we do so gratefully,
[4775.48 → 4777.80] knowing that every moment is borrowed grace.
[4777.80 → 4778.86] When we suffer,
[4779.02 → 4780.22] we do so hopefully,
[4780.44 → 4781.80] trusting that every season,
[4782.62 → 4784.32] even the hardest of seasons,
[4784.48 → 4785.90] are not wasted.
[4786.90 → 4788.02] And when we celebrate,
[4788.92 → 4790.78] we do so joyfully,
[4791.42 → 4794.06] knowing that every beautiful moment
[4794.06 → 4795.88] is a glimpse of eternity
[4795.88 → 4798.24] breaking through to your heart.
[4801.24 → 4803.42] I'm going to end this morning
[4803.42 → 4805.64] by asking you to stand.
[4805.64 → 4808.36] In just a moment,
[4808.36 → 4812.22] we are going to make a profession of faith together.
[4813.02 → 4815.92] And I want you to speak the portion that is for you.
[4816.00 → 4817.46] It will be on the screen indicated.
[4817.92 → 4820.82] And it will be a repetition of the refrain,
[4821.16 → 4823.98] our times are in his hands.
[4825.62 → 4827.20] Because this is what we have seen.
[4827.20 → 4830.70] God rules over time.
[4831.74 → 4833.78] And our task is not to master it,
[4833.86 → 4836.28] but to receive it with reverent joy.
[4837.78 → 4838.48] And in the end,
[4838.62 → 4842.06] Ecclesiastes brings this same confession
[4842.06 → 4844.76] and brings us to this same confession
[4844.76 → 4848.50] that faith alone in Christ makes possible.
[4848.50 → 4850.46] And so together,
[4851.18 → 4853.76] our times are in his hands.
[4854.42 → 4856.00] There is no greater comfort
[4856.00 → 4858.38] when everything seems out of control.
[4859.10 → 4861.30] Our times are in his hands.
[4861.80 → 4863.18] There is no greater refuge
[4863.18 → 4865.68] when the world is falling down around us.
[4866.44 → 4868.40] Our times are in his hands.
[4868.78 → 4870.16] There is no greater strength
[4870.16 → 4872.14] when all our strength has failed.
[4872.84 → 4875.02] Our times are in his hands.
[4875.02 → 4877.24] And there is no greater joy
[4877.24 → 4879.48] when we contemplate eternity
[4879.48 → 4881.38] set on our hearts.
[4882.14 → 4884.20] Our times are in his hands.
[4885.38 → 4887.12] And so, brothers and sisters,
[4887.38 → 4888.52] we rest.
[4889.28 → 4891.26] Not because we understand everything,
[4891.98 → 4894.24] but because we are known by the one who does.
[4895.32 → 4897.70] We rejoice not because life is easy,
[4898.18 → 4900.66] but because Christ has made it beautiful
[4900.66 → 4902.76] in his time.
[4903.36 → 4904.46] And we trust.
[4905.02 → 4907.68] Because the hands that hold our times
[4907.68 → 4911.00] are the hands that were once pierced
[4911.00 → 4913.48] for you and for me.
[4914.26 → 4916.90] Our times are in his hands.
[4917.70 → 4917.92] Amen.
[4918.68 → 4919.70] Let's pray together.
[4923.08 → 4926.02] God of all time.
[4926.72 → 4928.34] God beyond time.
[4928.50 → 4930.30] God before time.
[4930.30 → 4931.30] God beyond time.
[4931.30 → 4935.24] We behold you at this moment.
[4937.36 → 4939.56] We glimpse your majesty.
[4940.30 → 4942.32] We glimpse your beauty.
[4943.46 → 4945.06] And with reverence,
[4945.28 → 4947.76] may we respond with joy.
[4948.82 → 4951.08] Hear the worship of our hearts now
[4951.08 → 4953.34] that having seen your glory
[4953.34 → 4955.56] just a little bit more clearly this morning,
[4955.56 → 4958.92] our trust may be grown,
[4959.78 → 4962.14] our faith may be solidified,
[4962.14 → 4965.78] and our purpose going forward from this place
[4965.78 → 4967.82] may be more clear.
[4968.66 → 4971.42] We worship you, Lord Jesus.
[4972.22 → 4974.36] In your great and holy name we pray.
[4975.08 → 4975.48] Amen.
[4975.48 → 4975.54] Amen.
[4976.22 → 4976.78] Amen.

[5038.26 → 5052.26] Behold our King nothing can compare. Come let us adore Him.
[5056.26 → 5070.26] Who has given counsel to the Lord? Who can question any of His words?
[5070.26 → 5081.26] Who can teach the one who knows all things? Who can fathom all His wondrous deeds?
[5081.26 → 5091.26] Behold our God seated on His throne. Come let us adore Him.
[5091.26 → 5105.26] Behold our King nothing can compare. Come let us adore Him.

[5189.26 → 5203.26] Behold our King, nothing can compare, come let us adore Him.
[5209.26 → 5217.34] As you go, beholding God, know that you are held by Him.
[5217.86 → 5223.74] And so go with His blessing for the journey of life and faith in these next days and weeks to come.
[5224.06 → 5228.26] If you'd like to meet with someone for prayer, there will be someone up here after service.
[5228.34 → 5229.96] They would love to meet you and pray with you.
[5229.96 → 5236.26] Otherwise, I encourage everyone to gather for fellowship, for some refreshments in the foyer back there.
[5236.34 → 5238.28] Receive the blessing of God.
[5239.26 → 5243.40] God, go before you to lead you.
[5244.24 → 5246.66] God, go behind you to protect you.
[5247.48 → 5249.78] God, go beneath you to support you.
[5250.14 → 5252.88] And God, go beside you to befriend you.
[5253.34 → 5255.18] Do not be afraid.
[5255.18 → 5257.56] Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[5257.72 → 5265.00] Do not be afraid, but go in His peace to love and serve the Lord.
[5265.96 → 5266.44] Amen.
