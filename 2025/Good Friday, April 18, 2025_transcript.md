[3059.10 --> 3089.08]  and you're going to say,
[3089.10 --> 3119.10]  that we want to say,
[3119.10 --> 3149.08]  we know we're going to say,
[3149.10 --> 3179.10]  and you're going to say,
[3179.10 --> 3181.10]  and you're going to say,
[3181.10 --> 3209.08]  and you're going to say,
[3209.10 --> 3239.08]  and I'm going to say,
[3239.10 --> 3241.10]  and you're going to say,
[3241.10 --> 3243.10]  and you're going to say,
[3243.10 --> 3245.10]  and you're going to say,
[3245.10 --> 3247.10]  and you're going to say,
[3247.10 --> 3249.10]  and you're going to say,
[3249.10 --> 3253.10]  and you're going to say, and you're going to say,
[3253.10 --> 3255.10]  and you're going to say,
[3255.10 --> 3257.10]  and you're going to say,
[3257.10 --> 3259.10]  and you're going to say,
[3259.10 --> 3261.10]  and you're going to say,
[3261.10 --> 3263.10]  and you're going to say,
[3263.10 --> 3265.10]  and you're going to say,
[3265.10 --> 3267.10]  save yourselves, and you're going to say,
[3267.10 --> 3275.94]  said, aren't you the Messiah? Save yourself and save us. Notice in those instances, right, all the
[3275.94 --> 3281.80]  different titles of Jesus that are being thrown about. The Christ of God. Christ is the Greek
[3281.80 --> 3288.72]  word for Messiah, right? The chosen one, the king of the Jews. Now, all of these ideas and titles,
[3288.72 --> 3297.56]  Christ, Messiah, chosen one, king, all of them in this moment are tied to salvation. But in the end,
[3297.64 --> 3309.36]  not necessarily to save himself, but to save those whom he forgives. Now, quickly, of the 18 times that
[3309.36 --> 3317.00]  Luke uses the word save, four of them are in this text, and five of them are understood not as
[3317.00 --> 3325.20]  salvation as we know it, but as healed, as made well, as being made whole. The same rough breakdown
[3325.20 --> 3331.06]  happens in Matthew. He uses the word 15 times. Three times it means healed and made well. Mark uses the
[3331.06 --> 3337.06]  word 14 times, and five times it means healed and made well. And I belabor this because there's
[3337.06 --> 3344.46]  something about salvation that includes being made well. And so what are we seeing here? The cross
[3344.46 --> 3354.60]  isn't just forgiveness for sin, right? The cross is also healing, being made well from sin. At the cross
[3354.60 --> 3364.22]  of Jesus is healing from sin. Jesus said in Luke 5, it's not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.
[3364.72 --> 3372.48]  I've not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. And in some ways, sin is like a sickness
[3372.48 --> 3379.12]  that we need to be healed from. And Jesus is the doctor. Repentance involves bringing your sickness
[3379.12 --> 3384.94]  to the doctor, opening up your wounding to the healer, carrying your trauma to the cross.
[3386.30 --> 3394.14]  Salvation and the salvation of the cross is a kind of healing. The same sin that keeps us separated from
[3394.14 --> 3403.34]  a relationship with God can only be healed by God. And the beginning of healing from sin that comes from the cross
[3403.34 --> 3412.70]  of Jesus is confession. And again, we've mentioned this word already, but sometimes people hear the word
[3412.70 --> 3420.06]  confession, and they've got all sorts of ideas and baggage that comes with it. But confession is critical to
[3420.06 --> 3427.50]  right Christianity, and it is core to what it means to be a disciple of Jesus, right? Confessing isn't
[3427.50 --> 3433.28]  about beating yourself up in public or hating yourself in private, although maybe too many of us practice
[3433.28 --> 3442.04]  confession that way. I love the way that John Mark Comer describes it. He says that confession is about
[3442.04 --> 3448.90]  courageously naming your woundedness and wickedness in the presence of a loving community as you journey
[3448.90 --> 3461.46]  together towards wholeness. And in confession, it isn't only about your sin. It's also a confession about
[3461.46 --> 3472.10]  what is true, about who you are in all of its darkness and brokenness, but also who Jesus is, and into that
[3472.10 --> 3479.70]  moment, right? Who you are in Jesus. It's about taking all of those hidden things and exposing them to Jesus
[3479.70 --> 3489.24]  and to trusted others. And then in that moment, still experiencing love and acceptance. It's about crawling
[3489.24 --> 3498.28]  out of the pit of shame and basking in the light of the gospel. Confession is your part in dealing with sin,
[3498.28 --> 3507.84]  and God's part is the healing that follows. The cross makes that possible. We confess our secrets.
[3508.28 --> 3517.88]  He heals us from sin. The cross and our confession, the cross and our healing invite us to set all of who
[3517.88 --> 3525.84]  we are before all of who God is. And just like when you go to the doctor, you can expect healing for
[3525.84 --> 3533.64]  abdominal pain only if you tell her, I've got a sore tummy. Right? We need to confess to God in order to
[3533.64 --> 3542.52]  receive healing. The more we hide, the less we heal. So as you sit here tonight, are you looking for
[3542.52 --> 3547.46]  salvation? Are you looking for healing? Are you looking for something more than this brokenness, right?
[3547.52 --> 3552.72]  And brokenness more in both in your heart and in your mind, brokenness in the world around you?
[3552.72 --> 3560.58]  If you're looking, try confession. On the promise of God's word, try confession. James 5 verse 16 says,
[3560.98 --> 3566.24]  therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed.
[3566.96 --> 3573.14]  Notice those words together again. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.
[3574.30 --> 3581.16]  And Psalm 32 is so beautiful here. Psalm 32, the psalmist says,
[3581.16 --> 3588.12]  when I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long. For day and night your hand
[3588.12 --> 3596.32]  was heavy on me. My strength was sapped as in the heat of summer. Then, then I acknowledged my sin to
[3596.32 --> 3602.54]  you and did not cover up my iniquity. I said, I will confess my transgressions to the Lord and you
[3602.54 --> 3615.80]  forgave the guilt of my sin. Confession is putting to death sin in your life by exposing it to the light
[3615.80 --> 3626.10]  of the gospel. At the cross of Jesus, healing from sin is made possible by your confession and because of
[3626.10 --> 3638.32]  his love. And then lastly, look at verse 40. In verse 40, the criminal rebuked the other and said,
[3638.44 --> 3645.94]  do you fear or don't you fear God since we are under the same sentence? We are punished justly for we
[3645.94 --> 3654.04]  are getting what our deeds deserve, but this man has done nothing wrong. Right? This man recognizes that
[3654.04 --> 3662.82]  justice for him requires his death. Right? And fear of God in this moment is submission to the truth.
[3663.54 --> 3669.94]  The truth of who he is. Right? Don't you fear God isn't him saying you should be scared of what comes
[3669.94 --> 3678.74]  next. It's him saying, I accept what comes next because I submit myself to God. This man is recognizing
[3678.74 --> 3686.32]  I did evil in the sight of God and my death is just. This is what we deserve. And at the same time,
[3686.42 --> 3692.86]  he is recognizing that Jesus is innocent of any wrongdoing, innocent of any crime, innocent of any
[3692.86 --> 3700.00]  sin. And so we're beginning to see that at the cross of Jesus, in the third point to answer our question,
[3700.12 --> 3704.74]  at the cross of Jesus is a change of status because of sin.
[3704.74 --> 3712.16]  To the guilty man who hangs beside him but has recognized Jesus for who he really is. To the man
[3712.16 --> 3719.24]  who cries out in his own dying, Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom. To that man,
[3719.60 --> 3730.00]  Jesus says, truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise. In one moment, at a word from his
[3730.00 --> 3737.78]  savior, he goes from a rebel and a murderer to a brother. From an insurrectionist against Rome to a
[3737.78 --> 3745.96]  citizen of God's paradise, a citizen of God's kingdom. I love the way we read it in Galatians.
[3746.68 --> 3753.50]  In Galatians, the apostle Paul, reflecting on a truth like this, says, I have been crucified with Christ
[3753.50 --> 3761.80]  and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live, I live in the body. I live by faith
[3761.80 --> 3769.88]  in the son of God who loved me and gave himself up for me. Or in Romans, and way back at the beginning
[3769.88 --> 3776.10]  of this Lenten season, at our Ash Wednesday service, we read this text. And so the journey has now come
[3776.10 --> 3783.04]  full circle. For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin
[3783.04 --> 3790.42]  might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin because anyone who has died has
[3790.42 --> 3799.26]  been set free from sin. Why is the cross necessary for salvation? Because the death of Jesus means your
[3799.26 --> 3806.10]  new life. This is the core of the gospel, right? That Jesus lived the life I should have lived.
[3806.44 --> 3812.22]  That Jesus died the death that I deserved. And that because of his death on the cross, I am changed
[3812.22 --> 3822.06]  forever. My status because of sin is undone and I am made something new. My healing, my salvation from sin
[3822.06 --> 3831.30]  is accomplished and I live wholly now, purposefully in shalom with God my Father. And my forgiveness for
[3831.30 --> 3840.74]  sin is real because my confession is real. A genuine conversion because of an authentic confession.
[3840.74 --> 3852.50]  And there is a temptation. There is a temptation that is in front of us all in this moment right now.
[3853.62 --> 3863.66]  A temptation to rush past the cross of Good Friday through quickly the confusion of Holy Saturday
[3863.66 --> 3867.86]  in order to get to the joy of Resurrection Sunday.
[3870.86 --> 3874.98]  And let me be really clear. Sunday is coming.
[3876.42 --> 3885.90]  Sunday is coming. Nothing you can do or don't do will stop Sunday from coming. But precisely because
[3885.90 --> 3892.70]  Sunday is coming, slow down now. Stop.
[3896.06 --> 3905.50]  Stand at the foot of the cross and marvel that the cross is necessary for your forgiveness.
[3906.30 --> 3914.38]  The cross is necessary for your healing. And the cross is necessary for your change of status,
[3914.38 --> 3924.62]  your very identity in relationship to God, your Father. This is the power of the cross. And so don't rush past it.
[3926.62 --> 3927.26]  Instead,
[3928.94 --> 3929.50]  together,
[3930.30 --> 3932.62]  let's cling to it. Amen?
[3933.74 --> 3934.42]  Let's pray.
[3934.42 --> 3934.48]  Amen.
[3934.48 --> 3934.54]  Amen.
[3934.54 --> 3934.60]  Amen.
[3934.60 --> 3934.74]  Amen.
[3934.74 --> 3936.60]  Amen.
[3936.60 --> 3938.60]  Amen.
[3938.60 --> 3938.68]  Amen.
[3938.68 --> 3940.60]  Amen.
[3940.60 --> 3940.68]  Amen.
[3940.68 --> 3942.68]  Amen.
[3942.68 --> 3942.74]  Amen.
[3942.74 --> 3943.74]  Amen.
[3943.74 --> 3944.36]  Amen.
[3944.38 --> 3946.10]  God, our Heavenly Father,
[3946.10 --> 3949.34]  by your gift of grace,
[3950.60 --> 3952.04]  by your working faith,
[3952.16 --> 3954.16]  we cling to the cross.
[3957.74 --> 3960.48]  This is the power of the cross.
[3963.88 --> 3965.30]  In this moment,
[3965.30 --> 3968.26]  may we not rush past the truth.
[3970.30 --> 3971.64]  In this moment,
[3971.78 --> 3974.36]  may we not
[3974.36 --> 3978.14]  push back the confusion,
[3978.14 --> 3986.70]  but may we stand and reflect on the truth of the cross,
[3986.70 --> 3989.04]  the truth of the gospel.
[3989.04 --> 3991.48]  May we not be ashamed of the gospel,
[3991.48 --> 3994.58]  for it is the power of God unto salvation.
[3994.58 --> 3996.08]  God, our Lord,
[3996.08 --> 3998.76]  we cling to the cross.
[3998.76 --> 3999.46]  Lord, to your cross,
[4000.26 --> 4000.78]  we cling.
[4001.84 --> 4003.44]  In Jesus' name we pray.
[4004.34 --> 4004.74]  Amen.
[4004.74 --> 4004.82]  Amen.
[4004.82 --> 4015.38]  We pray to rise and sing with us.
[4015.38 --> 4044.08]  Christ on the road to Calvary
[4045.38 --> 4049.78]  Tried by sinful men
[4049.78 --> 4054.08]  Torn and beaten men
[4054.08 --> 4061.24]  Billed to a cross of wood
[4061.24 --> 4070.10]  This the power of the cross
[4070.10 --> 4074.10]  Christ became
[4074.10 --> 4078.02]  Sin for us
[4078.02 --> 4082.00]  Took the blame
[4082.00 --> 4084.42]  Bore the wrath
[4084.42 --> 4087.06]  We stand forgiven
[4087.06 --> 4091.10]  At the cross
[4091.10 --> 4103.00]  Oh to see the name
[4103.00 --> 4107.20]  Written on your face
[4107.20 --> 4115.10]  Bearing the awesome weight of sin
[4115.10 --> 4119.18]  Every bitter thought
[4119.18 --> 4123.20]  Every evil deed
[4123.20 --> 4128.86]  Crowning your bloodstained ground
[4128.86 --> 4136.86]  This the power of the cross
[4136.86 --> 4140.18]  Christ became
[4140.18 --> 4144.86]  Sin for us
[4144.86 --> 4148.78]  Took the blame
[4148.78 --> 4151.70]  For the wrath
[4151.70 --> 4153.62]  Quased and forgiven
[4153.62 --> 4157.62]  At the cross
[4157.62 --> 4169.90]  Now the daylight flees
[4169.90 --> 4173.54]  Now the ground beneath
[4173.54 --> 4178.00]  Quakes as its maker
[4178.00 --> 4182.00]  Bows its head
[4182.00 --> 4186.00]  Curtain torn in two
[4186.00 --> 4191.40]  Dead are raised to life
[4191.40 --> 4196.00]  Finish the victory cry
[4196.00 --> 4206.00]  Christ is the power of the cross
[4206.00 --> 4207.92]  Christ became
[4207.92 --> 4211.92]  Sin for us
[4211.92 --> 4215.84]  Took the blame
[4215.84 --> 4219.18]  For the wrath
[4219.18 --> 4221.66]  Is yet forgiven
[4221.66 --> 4224.24]  At the cross
[4224.24 --> 4244.12]  Following this next reading
[4244.12 --> 4245.32]  We will sing
[4245.32 --> 4246.28]  We will sing one more song
[4246.28 --> 4247.08]  And at the conclusion
[4247.08 --> 4247.82]  Of that song
[4247.82 --> 4249.00]  I invite you to
[4249.00 --> 4250.96]  Leave in reflection
[4250.96 --> 4252.14]  Together
[4252.14 --> 4253.98]  So leave together
[4253.98 --> 4255.14]  In silence
[4255.14 --> 4256.16]  And if you want to connect
[4256.16 --> 4256.68]  And talk
[4256.68 --> 4257.74]  It's beautiful outside
[4257.74 --> 4259.10]  We encourage you to do that
[4259.10 --> 4260.18]  But perhaps
[4260.18 --> 4261.68]  Maybe you want to sit
[4261.68 --> 4262.86]  And reflect
[4262.86 --> 4264.10]  For a moment longer
[4264.10 --> 4265.16]  And so this space
[4265.16 --> 4266.22]  Will be available
[4266.22 --> 4266.94]  For a little while
[4266.94 --> 4267.84]  For you to do that
[4267.84 --> 4269.14]  Following our worship
[4269.14 --> 4269.80]  Together
[4269.80 --> 4276.52]  It was now
[4276.52 --> 4277.30]  About noon
[4277.30 --> 4279.18]  And darkness
[4279.18 --> 4280.70]  Came over the whole land
[4280.70 --> 4282.38]  Until three in the afternoon
[4282.38 --> 4283.52]  For the sun
[4283.52 --> 4284.54]  Had stopped shining
[4284.54 --> 4286.14]  And the curtain
[4286.14 --> 4286.76]  Of the temple
[4286.76 --> 4287.80]  Was torn in two
[4287.80 --> 4289.36]  And Jesus called out
[4289.36 --> 4290.38]  With a loud voice
[4290.38 --> 4291.08]  Father
[4291.08 --> 4292.52]  Into your hands
[4292.52 --> 4293.76]  I commit my spirit
[4293.76 --> 4296.80]  And when he had said this
[4296.80 --> 4299.26]  He breathed his last
[4299.26 --> 4305.22]  And the centurion
[4305.22 --> 4308.32]  Seeing what had happened
[4308.32 --> 4310.14]  Praised God
[4310.14 --> 4311.36]  And said
[4311.36 --> 4312.42]  Surely this
[4312.42 --> 4314.20]  Was a righteous man
[4314.20 --> 4315.86]  And when all the people
[4315.86 --> 4316.42]  Who had gathered
[4316.42 --> 4317.52]  To witness this sight
[4317.52 --> 4318.66]  Saw what took place
[4318.66 --> 4320.04]  They beat their breasts
[4320.04 --> 4320.86]  And went away
[4320.86 --> 4323.56]  But all those who knew him
[4323.56 --> 4325.72]  Including the women
[4325.72 --> 4326.64]  Who had followed him
[4326.64 --> 4327.34]  From Galilee
[4327.34 --> 4329.38]  Stood at a distance
[4329.38 --> 4330.72]  Watching
[4330.72 --> 4332.06]  These things
[4332.06 --> 4332.56]  Like this
[4332.56 --> 4342.72]  So
[4342.72 --> 4344.94]  Where the whoever
[4344.94 --> 4345.78]  Was a Christian
[4345.78 --> 4345.96]  Who had recognized
[4345.96 --> 4346.46]  I be
[4346.46 --> 4348.00]  I eat
[4348.00 --> 4350.00]  And菜
[4350.00 --> 4350.68]  Would
[4350.68 --> 4353.00]  Who had
[4353.00 --> 4353.84]  Is
[4353.84 --> 4356.84]  On a
[4357.04 --> 4357.08]  To
[4357.08 --> 4359.08]  Amen.
[4387.08 --> 4404.08]  When they crucified my Lord, were you there when they crucified my Lord?
[4404.08 --> 4422.08]  Oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble.
[4422.08 --> 4433.08]  Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
[4433.08 --> 4442.08]  Were you there when they nailed Him to the tree?
[4442.08 --> 4454.08]  Were you there when they nailed Him to the tree?
[4454.08 --> 4472.08]  Oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble.
[4472.08 --> 4481.08]  Were you there when they nailed Him to the tree?
[4481.08 --> 4496.08]  Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb?
[4496.08 --> 4507.08]  Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb?
[4507.08 --> 4526.08]  Oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble.
[4526.08 --> 4541.08]  Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb?
[4556.08 --> 4557.08]  Okay.
[4557.08 --> 4563.08]  Is that how you wear his train or your which is zweite, the ink When the tree rub reads?
[4563.08 --> 4565.08]  Ah!
