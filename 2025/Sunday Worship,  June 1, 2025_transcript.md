[0.00 --> 29.98]  Thank you.
[30.00 --> 59.98]  Thank you.
[60.00 --> 89.98]  Thank you.
[90.00 --> 92.00]  Thank you.
[120.00 --> 122.00]  Thank you.
[150.00 --> 152.00]  Thank you.
[180.00 --> 182.00]  Thank you.
[210.00 --> 220.00]  Thank you.
[220.00 --> 222.00]  Thank you.
[222.00 --> 222.70]  Good morning.
[223.30 --> 224.54]  That was my fault, Nico.
[224.80 --> 225.84]  I didn't turn it on.
[227.42 --> 230.78]  Good morning, and welcome to church.
[230.88 --> 234.00]  Special welcome if you are a guest with us this morning.
[234.00 --> 235.18]  My name is Chris.
[235.38 --> 241.24]  I'm one of the pastors here, and it's my privilege to kick off our worship together.
[241.92 --> 244.70]  Before we begin, we've got a couple announcements to make.
[245.52 --> 252.10]  And so first, I just want to thank those people who came out on Thursday night to our Ascension Day service.
[252.10 --> 262.34]  We had a special service here on Thursday, and it was a wonderful time and a beautiful time together in our worship as we entered into the presence of Christ our King.
[262.34 --> 268.48]  Also, for announcements, I'm going to rattle off a couple things that are happening today.
[268.48 --> 281.70]  And so immediately or shortly after our worship this morning, pastor's class is going to happen with me, and that's for people who are interested in doing profession of faith.
[281.70 --> 297.28]  Generally, this is kind of the targeted audience here is the people who have made it through our youth program in the last little while, young adults as well, who want to do profession of faith to stand up and say,
[297.40 --> 302.26]  yes, this I believe, and I want to believe it in your presence together.
[303.28 --> 304.68]  And so we have a class for that.
[304.74 --> 308.92]  That's after service today, about 15, 20 minutes by the time we finish.
[308.92 --> 312.58]  So grab a coffee, hang out with some people, and then we'll meet in the multi-purpose room.
[313.52 --> 314.62]  And we'll meet for about an hour.
[315.28 --> 320.84]  Also after service today is youth coffee for the youth program, and that's happening at the Verhoofs house.
[321.04 --> 321.92]  And so Verhoofs, wave.
[322.66 --> 323.18]  There you go.
[323.28 --> 326.52]  If you need to know how to get to their house, you can talk to them or Pastor Kevin.
[326.66 --> 328.38]  He'll gladly give you that information.
[329.76 --> 337.06]  And then tonight at 7 p.m., we have the Heidelberg Catechism Adult Education Reading Group.
[337.06 --> 338.94]  And so you've been participating in that.
[339.00 --> 344.76]  If you've been participating in that, we have our final reading group tonight at 7 p.m.,
[344.76 --> 349.74]  where we'll finish the catechism together and get through in our conversations.
[350.58 --> 356.58]  And then lastly, next week Saturday, or next weekend, rather, on Saturday,
[357.44 --> 362.38]  we will be having our monthly worship service at Sunridge Gardens.
[362.38 --> 365.86]  And so that begins at 2 p.m. at Sunridge Gardens.
[366.28 --> 372.62]  Some residents who are members here join us, but then a number of others who live up at Sunridge Gardens
[372.62 --> 377.00]  come down and worship with us for about an hour or so, and then we hang out together after that.
[377.04 --> 380.24]  And so you're invited to join and participate in that with us.
[381.32 --> 383.18]  That's it for my announcements.
[384.00 --> 385.96]  I'm going to invite you, as you're able to stand,
[386.40 --> 389.08]  that we might be welcomed in the presence of God.
[389.08 --> 391.70]  We mark that by receiving his greeting.
[392.60 --> 395.50]  And then after receiving the greeting of God,
[395.58 --> 400.22]  I invite you to turn to those around you and to welcome them into worship as well.
[400.32 --> 401.62]  You can do that by saying,
[401.72 --> 403.84]  The Lord be with you, or the peace of Christ be with you,
[404.16 --> 407.46]  shaking a hand, nodding a head, however you are moved.
[407.66 --> 412.98]  Let's receive the greeting of God and be welcomed into this time of worship together.
[412.98 --> 419.52]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father,
[419.80 --> 422.66]  from the Lord Jesus Christ, Son, and our Savior,
[423.20 --> 425.68]  through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[426.48 --> 426.76]  Amen.
[442.98 --> 472.96]  Let the words of Ruth,
[472.96 --> 476.88]  Revelation, help us to focus our hearts and minds
[476.88 --> 482.50]  on the one who sits on the throne and the Lamb who was slain.
[484.68 --> 487.08]  Revelation 5, verse 11 to 13.
[487.32 --> 490.78]  Then I looked and heard the voice of many angels
[490.78 --> 496.62]  numbering thousands upon thousands and ten thousand times ten thousand.
[496.62 --> 502.16]  They encircled the throne and the living creatures and the elders.
[502.58 --> 504.82]  In a loud voice they were saying,
[505.46 --> 508.58]  Worthy is the Lamb who was slain,
[508.96 --> 513.26]  to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength
[513.26 --> 516.28]  and honor and glory and praise.
[517.12 --> 520.26]  Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth
[520.26 --> 522.74]  and under the earth and on the sea
[522.74 --> 524.96]  and all that is in them saying,
[525.96 --> 527.84]  To him who sits on the throne
[527.84 --> 530.66]  and to the Lamb be praise
[530.66 --> 533.42]  and honor and glory and power
[533.42 --> 535.38]  forever and ever.
[535.38 --> 551.12]  We stand and lift up our hands
[551.12 --> 555.60]  for the joy of the Lord is our strength.
[557.60 --> 561.66]  We bow down and worship him now.
[562.04 --> 565.50]  How great, how awesome is he.
[566.04 --> 568.58]  And together we sing.
[571.58 --> 574.12]  Everyone sing.
[574.12 --> 580.56]  Holy is the Lord God Almighty
[580.56 --> 585.60]  The earth is filled with his glory
[585.60 --> 590.48]  Holy is the Lord God Almighty
[590.48 --> 595.50]  The earth is filled with his glory
[595.50 --> 600.38]  The earth is filled with his glory
[600.38 --> 605.92]  We stand and lift up our hands
[605.92 --> 610.70]  For the joy of the Lord is our strength
[610.70 --> 616.28]  We bow down and worship him now
[616.28 --> 620.00]  How great, how awesome is he.
[620.00 --> 623.16]  And together we sing.
[625.72 --> 628.20]  Everyone sing.
[630.38 --> 634.76]  Holy is the Lord God Almighty
[634.76 --> 639.76]  The earth is filled with his glory
[639.76 --> 644.70]  Holy is the Lord God Almighty
[644.70 --> 649.70]  The earth is filled with his glory
[649.70 --> 654.48]  The earth is filled with his glory
[654.48 --> 657.86]  It's rising up
[657.86 --> 658.86]  It's rising up
[658.86 --> 659.86]  All around
[659.86 --> 664.86]  It's the apple of the Lord's renown
[664.86 --> 666.86]  It's rising up
[666.86 --> 667.86]  It's rising up
[667.86 --> 668.86]  All around
[668.86 --> 674.86]  It's the apple of the Lord's renown
[674.86 --> 678.86]  Together we sing
[678.86 --> 697.24]  Everyone sing
[697.24 --> 704.14]  The earth is filled with His glory.
[704.14 --> 711.68]  The earth is filled with His glory.
[727.24 --> 746.44]  Worthy of every song we could ever sing
[746.44 --> 753.06]  Worthy of all the praise you could ever give
[753.06 --> 759.18]  Worthy of every breath we could ever give
[759.18 --> 761.76]  We live for you
[761.76 --> 772.66]  Jesus, the name above every other name
[772.66 --> 779.18]  Jesus, the only one who could ever sing
[779.18 --> 785.30]  Worthy of every breath we could ever give
[785.30 --> 787.30]  We live for you
[787.30 --> 791.18]  We live for you
[791.18 --> 797.30]  Holy, there is no one like you
[797.30 --> 800.56]  There is none beside you
[800.56 --> 804.94]  Open up my eyes in wonder
[804.94 --> 809.88]  Show me who you are and fill me
[809.88 --> 812.56]  With your heart and lead me
[813.12 --> 818.12]  In your love to those around me
[818.12 --> 836.24]  Jesus, the name above every other name
[836.24 --> 842.44]  Jesus, the only one who could ever sing
[842.44 --> 848.56]  Worthy of every breath we could ever give

[908.36 --> 911.48]  Upon your love
[911.48 --> 916.36]  It is a firm foundation
[916.36 --> 920.48]  I will put my trust
[920.48 --> 923.48]  In you alone
[923.48 --> 928.48]  And I will not be shaken

[976.56 --> 986.56]  Please join me in our prayer of encouragement
[986.56 --> 991.56]  Father
[991.56 --> 992.56]  Father
[992.56 --> 994.56]  It is a wonder
[994.56 --> 995.56]  What you have made
[995.56 --> 996.56]  Of me
[996.56 --> 997.56]  In Jesus
[997.56 --> 999.56]  It is the hope
[999.56 --> 1000.56]  I cling to today
[1000.56 --> 1002.56]  The comfort
[1002.56 --> 1004.56]  That satisfies my heart
[1004.56 --> 1007.56]  I am a dearly loved
[1007.56 --> 1008.56]  Child of God

[1011.56 --> 1012.56]  But belong to Jesus Christ
[1012.56 --> 1014.56]  Body and soul
[1014.56 --> 1016.56]  In life and in death

[1122.56 --> 1123.56]  We've been through fire
[1123.56 --> 1125.56]  By the power of His name
[1125.56 --> 1127.56]  We've fallen deeper
[1127.56 --> 1129.56]  In love with you

[1259.12 --> 1266.30]  Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[1266.30 --> 1272.62]  Highest praises, honor and glory
[1272.62 --> 1278.12]  Be unto your name
[1278.12 --> 1285.12]  Be unto your name
[1285.12 --> 1292.30]  We are the broken, you are the healer
[1292.30 --> 1298.62]  Jesus, Redeemer, mighty to save
[1298.62 --> 1304.30]  You are the love song, we'll sing forever
[1304.30 --> 1311.48]  Vowing before you, blessing your name
[1311.48 --> 1319.30]  Holy, holy Lord God almighty
[1319.30 --> 1325.48]  Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[1325.48 --> 1332.66]  Highest praises, honor and glory

[1377.20 --> 1383.20]  Be unto your name
[1383.20 --> 1386.38]  I invite you to see it
[1386.38 --> 1388.38]  I invite you to see it
[1388.38 --> 1402.02]  Good morning
[1402.02 --> 1404.82]  My name is Allison
[1404.82 --> 1406.52]  Allison and I am one of the deacons
[1406.52 --> 1408.78]  Here at Langley Emanuel
[1408.78 --> 1411.22]  This morning I want to highlight
[1411.22 --> 1415.64]  Three different things for the offering
[1415.64 --> 1417.96]  One is just the normal running of the church
[1417.96 --> 1420.28]  The programs and things we have going on here
[1420.28 --> 1421.82]  At the church
[1421.82 --> 1427.82]  The other thing is the baby bottle thing
[1427.82 --> 1432.78]  This is an amazing organization
[1432.78 --> 1437.24]  That helps women who need help
[1437.24 --> 1439.96]  With pregnancy and after care
[1439.96 --> 1440.96]  After abortion
[1440.96 --> 1442.16]  They do amazing work
[1442.16 --> 1443.32]  So the baby bottles
[1443.32 --> 1444.36]  They're out there
[1444.36 --> 1447.04]  It's not too late to pick one up
[1447.04 --> 1449.18]  Traditionally we bring them back
[1449.18 --> 1452.64]  To the church on Father's Day
[1452.64 --> 1455.56]  So I'll be out there at the back
[1455.56 --> 1456.26]  After the service
[1456.26 --> 1458.32]  If you need any questions
[1458.32 --> 1460.02]  If you have any questions about that
[1460.02 --> 1463.08]  The third thing is that we want to highlight today
[1463.08 --> 1464.46]  Is Safe Church
[1464.46 --> 1466.20]  And that's an organization
[1466.20 --> 1467.96]  That helps churches
[1467.96 --> 1470.14]  In all kinds of denominations
[1470.14 --> 1472.18]  Ours included
[1472.18 --> 1476.86]  Create and develop a safe place
[1476.86 --> 1479.44]  For families, for children
[1479.44 --> 1484.58]  For anyone who is in an abusive situation
[1484.58 --> 1485.96]  And just need some help
[1485.96 --> 1486.88]  And some safety
[1486.88 --> 1488.58]  Some safe place to go
[1488.58 --> 1491.30]  Again an amazing organization
[1491.30 --> 1493.52]  Sadly needed in our culture
[1493.52 --> 1495.76]  But they are here
[1495.76 --> 1497.72]  They're at our church as well
[1497.72 --> 1504.50]  So that's the three things this morning
[1504.50 --> 1505.64]  So thank you
[1505.64 --> 1517.26]  Let's pray that please
[1517.26 --> 1520.74]  ...
[1520.74 --> 1539.70]  Jesus, be the center
[1539.70 --> 1546.24]  Be my source, be my life
[1546.24 --> 1547.84]  Jesus
[1547.84 --> 1559.02]  Jesus, be the center
[1559.02 --> 1565.50]  Be my hope, be my song
[1565.50 --> 1567.04]  Jesus
[1567.04 --> 1574.96]  Be the fire in my heart
[1574.96 --> 1579.70]  Be the wind in these sails
[1579.70 --> 1584.38]  Be the reason that I live
[1584.38 --> 1585.96]  Jesus
[1585.96 --> 1588.40]  Jesus
[1588.40 --> 1594.40]  Jesus
[1594.40 --> 1599.14]  Be my vision
[1599.14 --> 1605.58]  Be my path, be my guide
[1605.58 --> 1607.14]  Jesus
[1607.14 --> 1614.82]  Be the fire in my heart
[1614.82 --> 1619.56]  Be the wind in these sails
[1619.56 --> 1624.10]  Be the reason that I live
[1624.10 --> 1625.82]  Jesus
[1625.82 --> 1628.06]  Jesus
[1628.06 --> 1633.56]  Jesus
[1633.56 --> 1638.30]  Be the center
[1638.30 --> 1642.98]  Be my source
[1642.98 --> 1644.56]  Be my light
[1644.56 --> 1646.56]  Jesus
[1646.56 --> 1648.56]  Jesus
[1648.56 --> 1661.72]  Amen
[1663.96 --> 1665.36]  Jesus
[1665.36 --> 1667.42]  Jesus
[1667.42 --> 1674.24]  time, but we'll share a little bit about our theme a minute here. Oh boy, out of breath even.
[1675.92 --> 1682.10]  Nice to see you guys. Come on up. Anybody else? It's welcome. I know I have a special bag here,
[1682.14 --> 1690.62]  as usual, a few props. I have a bit of a confession though. I am not a super good swimmer.
[1691.62 --> 1697.12]  Who here is a good swimmer? Who's in swimming lessons this summer? Yeah, a few of you guys are
[1697.12 --> 1703.52]  in swimming lessons. I'm not a super good swimmer and I feel like I might need a little bit of help
[1703.52 --> 1710.82]  with that. So I'm just kind of wondering if I could have two volunteers that could be my coach for a
[1710.82 --> 1716.62]  minute. Yeah, Carys, you want to come on up? Did you want to come up and help too? No? We need another
[1716.62 --> 1720.42]  coach. How about you two ladies as well? You're so enthusiastic. You can help too. Why don't you come
[1720.42 --> 1726.32]  help too? Yeah, okay. We can't all wear... Okay, we've got a coach's hat for you. We got to play the part
[1726.32 --> 1734.48]  here a little bit, or else I won't believe you. And a wee whistle. Oh boy. Okay. Yep. And we're
[1734.48 --> 1742.16]  gonna need this. We're gonna need this lifeguarding shirt, lest something go wrong here up front.
[1742.16 --> 1749.12]  And I suppose I should play the part too, eh? So before we get into the training session that I'm
[1749.12 --> 1753.28]  sure you ladies have prepared. I've got, oh, I've got this.
[1753.28 --> 1757.28]  It's not gonna work.
[1757.28 --> 1765.28]  Okay. Okay, I'm part there and... What's that?
[1765.28 --> 1769.28]  Did you bring a water pool or something?
[1769.28 --> 1775.44]  Oh, I did bring a towel and my swim shorts, but maybe we'll spare everybody that.
[1775.44 --> 1779.44]  Here, someone can hold... Yeah, you just hold my towel there. Thank you. And don't
[1779.44 --> 1785.44]  forget, I have a lot of hair. So... I don't want any drag in the water.
[1785.44 --> 1792.32]  That was a balloon. A balloon? There. It's like a glove.
[1792.32 --> 1797.68]  Yeah, okay. Okay, okay, okay. Now we're all ready. We're playing the part. We've got my whole team
[1797.68 --> 1805.20]  of coaches here. When it comes to swimming, you got some tips for me? You do? What's my first tip,
[1805.20 --> 1807.44]  if I want to be a good swimmer? Kick.
[1807.44 --> 1813.04]  Kick. Kick. All right, we've got a kick. Kick. There's kicking involved in swimming. Anything
[1813.04 --> 1821.04]  else you want to share? What's another tip? Hold my breath. Good idea. That's a smoking good idea.
[1821.04 --> 1827.04]  I didn't think about that one. What, anything I should do like every day to be really good at swimming?
[1827.92 --> 1837.04]  Any ideas? Practice. Practice? What the? Like every day. You want me to kick and hold my breath?
[1837.04 --> 1844.96]  Every day. In a pool? In a pool? Yeah. If you have a pool. If I have a pool.
[1844.96 --> 1849.04]  Or just go to the public pool. Okay, or I can go to a public pool. Okay, that's a good idea. Okay,
[1849.04 --> 1857.60]  anything else I should do every day? Exercise. Oh, what kind of exercises? Any ideas? Do you have any
[1857.60 --> 1864.48]  good ideas for exercises? No. Push-ups? Oh boy. Oh boy, this sounds like a lot of work. I don't know if...
[1864.48 --> 1873.28]  Oh, what's... More tips? Pardon me? Arm circles. Arm circles. Can you show me? Oh, okay. Show me. Oh yeah,
[1873.28 --> 1879.36]  that's okay. Good arm. And what about holding my breath? How do I hold my breath? Oh, okay. Oh, we got extra.
[1879.36 --> 1888.80]  And what about kicking? Like, like one kick or like double? Okay. All right. Yes. Oh, okay. I'm feeling
[1888.80 --> 1893.20]  really good about this. So I feel like you guys have more tips. And I think there's some more tips from you
[1893.20 --> 1900.32]  guys. And I really love that I have this whole team of coaches helping me out. So in Children's Worship
[1900.32 --> 1906.88]  Time, we're going to talk a little bit more about coaches and the people in our lives, the mentors in
[1906.88 --> 1912.64]  our lives that have helped us be better people, right? Because this month we're talking all about
[1912.64 --> 1921.68]  the book of Hebrew, right? And training that comes with being really great followers of Jesus. Yeah?
[1921.68 --> 1925.76]  So let's go to Children's Worship Time. We can talk more about that. You guys can keep that stuff on,
[1925.76 --> 1930.96]  because I need to get some more tips from you. We're going to keep the conversation going in
[1930.96 --> 1936.72]  Children's Worship Time. But before we go, shall we stand together? And we will bless the congregation
[1936.72 --> 1942.24]  as they stay to hear a message. And they will bless us in return as we go to learn more about the book
[1942.24 --> 1951.20]  of Hebrews. All right, arms up. The Lord be with you. And also with you.
[1955.76 --> 1970.40]  Whenever the Children's Worship Time people come up here, you just never know what you're going to get.
[1972.40 --> 1979.52]  At this time in our worship together, we're going to spend a moment trusting in God's provision for
[1979.52 --> 1985.28]  the leadership of this church. And so we're going to draw lots from the office bearers who have,
[1985.28 --> 1989.92]  or the potential office bearers who have been nominated and affirmed in our process over the last
[1990.64 --> 1996.24]  number of weeks and months. So I'm going to invite the outgoing office bearers who are here
[1996.24 --> 2000.88]  to come up to the front as part of this process.
[2000.88 --> 2014.96]  And for you, first we want to say thank you for your willingness to serve and for the
[2016.32 --> 2022.72]  three years and plus that you have given us in this work. We are really grateful for the way that God has
[2022.72 --> 2029.60]  used you and provided for this church through your service to Christ in our midst. And so thank you for
[2029.60 --> 2035.36]  that. Before we draw lots, we're going to pray together. And I have asked Seth to take care of that.
[2035.36 --> 2043.84]  Please join me in prayer. Father in heaven, we thank you for this day. And we thank you for more evidence of
[2043.84 --> 2048.64]  your faithful providence for this church. Thank you for the way that you have blessed us with people who
[2048.64 --> 2053.04]  have willing hearts, who are willing to follow your call to allow their names to stand for this nomination.
[2053.84 --> 2059.04]  We pray to you that you will guide this next step as we draw lots. You know the people that you have
[2059.04 --> 2064.80]  chosen already. And we thank you that we get to have that revealed to us today. And we can put our trust
[2064.80 --> 2069.04]  in you because you are a loving God always and forever. Amen.
[2069.04 --> 2072.88]  Thank you.
[2072.88 --> 2079.84]  And so the way this process ordinarily works, the outgoing office bearer will draw the lot for the
[2079.84 --> 2086.24]  new office bearer to replace them. Because we only have one deacon and we're looking for two positions,
[2086.24 --> 2100.88]  Yap is going to draw two names out of the bag labeled deacon there.
[2100.88 --> 2104.96]  Can you read them? Yes, I can.
[2104.96 --> 2107.60]  Uh, Warren Verhoof.
[2110.96 --> 2112.56]  And uh, Pete Birkenpass.
[2114.72 --> 2118.80]  Excellent. Warren Verhoof and Pete Birkenpass.
[2119.68 --> 2126.40]  And then now we're going to draw for Elder. And so John, if you would have Seth draw one.
[2126.40 --> 2131.36]  And then Ken, you can draw one. And John, you draw one.
[2131.36 --> 2133.44]  And then Ken, you can draw one.
[2141.44 --> 2142.16]  Pim Schoen.
[2142.16 --> 2145.68]  Jesus Hernandez.
[2145.68 --> 2148.16]  Frank Welfing.
[2148.16 --> 2150.08]  Amen.
[2150.08 --> 2157.12]  To all those whose names have been drawn, thank you for your willingness to serve.
[2157.44 --> 2162.64]  And to those whose names haven't been drawn, we trust and pray that God will use you in our midst
[2162.64 --> 2168.08]  in a different way. And to that effect, we would like to also pray together. And so I'm going to
[2168.08 --> 2173.52]  conclude this process with a prayer of thanksgiving and discernment together. Let's pray.
[2176.32 --> 2180.80]  Heavenly Father, we thank you for again providing leaders for your church.
[2181.76 --> 2187.04]  We thank you for moving in all these people to accept the nomination. And we pray that in this
[2187.04 --> 2194.24]  selection, those chosen would hear your call. And so equip them for the work of service you call them
[2194.24 --> 2202.16]  to. A special prayer of thanksgiving for those not chosen this morning. May they hear your call in
[2202.16 --> 2210.64]  another way and find opportunity to serve your church. We trust and commit to trusting the process
[2210.64 --> 2219.44]  and guiding of the Holy Spirit. May we all, together as one, serve you faithfully, sacrificially,
[2219.44 --> 2227.76]  and with humility. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen. Thank you, gentlemen. You may go back to your seats.
[2227.76 --> 2236.08]  Amen. The Lord willing, next week we will have the installation for these office bearers in our
[2236.08 --> 2239.28]  midst and as part of our worship together. Thank you.
[2250.48 --> 2257.52]  Before I lead you in our congregational prayer, I just had a note this morning of a group of young
[2257.52 --> 2262.24]  people from our church that are going on a mission trip to the Philippines, a short-term mission of
[2262.24 --> 2270.72]  two weeks. I would like to pray for Jared Alcoma, Josh Chamberlain, Mikkelte Grimm, and Sarah Molenkamp.
[2271.36 --> 2277.68]  They have joined with a group from Gateway Community Church in Abbotsford. And they're reaching out to
[2277.68 --> 2290.96]  a group of people in the Philippines who have not been, they're kind of in a group that is not part of the regular
[2293.44 --> 2299.36]  people in, they're an outreach group that is in kind of in the jungles their way out. So it'll be a
[2299.36 --> 2303.20]  bit of a trek for them to get there and we pray a blessing on their trip, on their time there.
[2303.20 --> 2313.92]  Also, mention of Ethan Fisher who was married on May 27th to Anna. We pray a blessing on their
[2314.48 --> 2321.52]  their wedding and the marriage that they have just started that may be a blessing for both of them as
[2321.52 --> 2333.04]  they take on this life together. Also a note of my sister to Jo to Clary Klosterhoff, Joan has
[2333.68 --> 2340.16]  finished her cancer treatment and we're praying for a good result from that. Lord, we
[2342.32 --> 2347.04]  bring these people before you in our prayer and others that are in our congregation that need your
[2347.04 --> 2358.40]  prayer as well. Let's pray. Oh Lord God, we come before you this morning. Lord, to you only can we
[2358.40 --> 2364.16]  give praise and honour and glory. You are the only one that we can give that to. We cannot give it to
[2364.16 --> 2370.08]  any other. Lord, you are the creator of this world. You have brought it into being. You've brought us into
[2370.08 --> 2376.96]  being as people to give you the honour and glory that is due your name. Lord, we do that now this
[2376.96 --> 2382.24]  morning as we worship together. We're thankful for the opportunity and the freedom we have to do this.
[2383.68 --> 2393.04]  Lord, we come as sinful people, broken hearted. Lord, not always giving our due to you. Lord, we pray for
[2393.04 --> 2404.64]  forgiveness that is needed as people who are broken and sinful. Lord, we live in a broken world and we see
[2404.64 --> 2412.88]  many challenges in our community. Lord, sometimes it's health, physical, mental, broken relationships.
[2412.88 --> 2420.80]  Lord, we bring these relationships before you for healing, for strength, recovery. Lord, especially those
[2420.80 --> 2425.92]  who are battling with cancer, Lord, and that seems to be a difficult thing to deal with, sometimes with
[2425.92 --> 2433.92]  good results, sometimes not. Lord, we pray for Tessa and Doug who are doing treatment still. We pray for
[2433.92 --> 2441.52]  Tanya who is living with hospice care, Lord. We pray a blessing for her and her challenges with the lung
[2441.52 --> 2447.20]  cancer she's dealing with. We pray for your mercy in her life, for healing, for strength, for peace.
[2447.20 --> 2454.88]  We pray for Joan too, who has undergone treatment and looking forward to a good result. We pray for a
[2454.88 --> 2456.56]  blessing in that situation as well.
[2460.96 --> 2465.60]  Lord, we pray for these young people that we mentioned earlier that are going to
[2466.72 --> 2473.04]  the Philippines on a short-term mission trip. Lord, as they give the lives for this two-week period to
[2473.04 --> 2479.52]  reach out to untouched peoples. We pray a blessing on their trip, that your spirit may hover over them
[2479.52 --> 2486.24]  as they go. Lord, each one needs your presence as they spend this time doing your work.
[2489.04 --> 2494.96]  Lord, I pray a blessing for Ethan and Anna too, as they have joined in marriage. We pray a blessing on
[2494.96 --> 2501.12]  that family as they've started their lives together, that they may serve you in whatever capacity you have
[2501.12 --> 2510.88]  blessed them with. Lord, we pray once again for this church and the ministries that it has, the work
[2510.88 --> 2517.44]  that is being done here. We're thankful for the pastors that we have, for office bearers who are willing to
[2517.44 --> 2524.48]  serve, for those who have served and will be serving. Lord, we pray for the ministry leaders as they're
[2525.12 --> 2529.04]  coming to the end of a season and looking forward to a new season to come in the fall.
[2529.04 --> 2536.64]  We pray a blessing on the time that summertime can give rest and relief, but also renewing of energy
[2536.64 --> 2543.76]  for the work that needs to be done. Lord, I pray for our governments, Lord, as we
[2546.24 --> 2551.76]  know that they need your presence, your guiding and leading for them to govern honestly and truthfully.
[2551.76 --> 2558.48]  We pray a blessing, Lord, on Kevin as he will preaching your word this morning.
[2559.52 --> 2565.68]  Work in his heart to say the words that you want him to say to us that your spirit may move in our lives.
[2565.68 --> 2580.16]  Lord, as the psalm five says, let all who take refuge in you rejoice. Let them sing joyful praises forever.
[2580.88 --> 2585.92]  Spread your protection over them that all who love your name may be filled with joy.
[2585.92 --> 2592.24]  Lord, we pray for you bless the godly, O Lord. You surround them with your shield of love.
[2595.12 --> 2602.96]  To you, O Lord, do we pray through the power of the cross for Jesus Christ who died on the cross for our sins.
[2604.00 --> 2615.68]  We pray this in the name of Jesus Christ in his name alone and your name alone. Amen.
[2615.92 --> 2617.92]  Amen.
[2631.84 --> 2641.68]  I actually don't remember where I heard this story from or even who I heard this story about or who it is about.
[2641.68 --> 2648.80]  It might have been a friend of a friend or a great aunt, I'm not sure. It's also possible that one of you told me this story.
[2649.44 --> 2653.52]  And if it was you, you could come up to me afterwards and say it was me and I apologize if I forgot.
[2653.68 --> 2657.30]  But this story did leave a place in my brain and it came to my mind this week.
[2657.52 --> 2662.94]  There was this elderly woman someone in my life knew who had played the piano her entire life.
[2662.94 --> 2670.48]  She'd grown up playing it, spent years playing the piano in front of church, helping with choirs.
[2670.58 --> 2673.04]  I think she even taught the piano to some students.
[2673.90 --> 2678.94]  But father time kind of kept on churning and eventually health problems and some family transitions
[2679.46 --> 2683.60]  and probably a bunch of other things caused her to slowly stop playing.
[2683.60 --> 2690.04]  Eventually it had been well over a decade since she had last tickled the ivories, as the kids say.
[2691.12 --> 2697.12]  One day, though, her young granddaughter was sitting in her house with her and she noticed this piano in the corner of the room.
[2698.08 --> 2700.54]  She asked her grandma, Grandma, did you play that?
[2700.90 --> 2701.78]  And grandma said, yes.
[2701.98 --> 2704.40]  And the granddaughter said, well, could you play something for me?
[2704.82 --> 2707.74]  And the grandmother looked at her granddaughter and said, I don't remember.
[2707.74 --> 2709.72]  I don't think I've played in 10 years.
[2709.82 --> 2710.68]  I don't think I can play.
[2711.36 --> 2713.98]  And the granddaughter looked at her and said, well, come on, grandma, just try.
[2714.38 --> 2715.08]  You used to.
[2716.04 --> 2722.04]  And so she got up and she sat down at the piano and she sat down and just started to play.
[2722.56 --> 2728.38]  And within a minute or two, the songs came back and the music started flowing out of her fingers again.
[2729.34 --> 2730.46]  And she smiled.
[2731.54 --> 2737.32]  She just needed her granddaughter to remind her of what she had forgotten.
[2738.60 --> 2741.54]  The story is a bit of a picture of what we're going to look at today.
[2741.74 --> 2743.62]  I think sometimes we feel a little bit lost.
[2743.72 --> 2748.96]  We feel like we've forgotten who we are, how to live, perhaps even what to believe.
[2749.92 --> 2752.92]  Sometimes we may get confused by the world around us.
[2753.40 --> 2758.08]  That's one of the things that happened to this church in Thessalonica that we've been looking at recently.
[2758.30 --> 2761.84]  But our text today, God calls us to remember.
[2762.86 --> 2766.68]  He's reminding those who believe of what they already know.
[2766.68 --> 2770.80]  And so we're going to look at that text now, which is part of our sermon series.
[2770.92 --> 2775.62]  We've been going through these two letters to the church of the Thessalonican church.
[2776.10 --> 2778.12]  And so we are on 2 Thessalonians now.
[2778.28 --> 2781.84]  We're going to look at chapter 2 and we're going to read verses 13 to 17.
[2781.96 --> 2785.00]  As always, I encourage you, pull out those Bibles you brought with us.
[2785.10 --> 2786.46]  Grab one from the back if you need.
[2786.52 --> 2791.22]  You can even turn your phones on and check out the Bible apps with you this morning.
[2791.22 --> 2793.52]  But please do follow along.
[2794.44 --> 2798.82]  So in Thessalonians 2, verses 13 to 17, we read this.
[2800.34 --> 2805.36]  But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers and sisters, loved by the Lord,
[2805.64 --> 2812.22]  because God chose you as firstfruits to be saved through the sanctifying work of the Spirit
[2812.22 --> 2813.96]  and through belief in the truth.
[2813.96 --> 2820.84]  He called you to this through our gospel that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2821.48 --> 2826.46]  So then, brothers and sisters, stand firm and hold fast to the teachings we passed on to you,
[2826.74 --> 2828.60]  whether by word of mouth or by letter.
[2829.32 --> 2835.12]  May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by his grace gave us
[2835.12 --> 2842.42]  eternal encouragement and good hope, encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good deed and word.
[2842.42 --> 2844.12]  The word of the Lord.
[2846.04 --> 2849.40]  It's like we mentioned, the last couple weeks, Pastor Chris and Josh,
[2849.54 --> 2856.52]  they've led us through a couple of sermons on one of the struggles that this church in Thessalonica was going through.
[2857.20 --> 2859.90]  This church was concerned and they were confused.
[2860.26 --> 2863.40]  They were worried that Jesus had already come back.
[2864.20 --> 2866.40]  And they were uncertain of where that left them.
[2867.44 --> 2869.88]  Paul then told them how this just simply is not true.
[2869.88 --> 2874.04]  He mentioned a bit about the apocalypse or Christ's revelation,
[2874.38 --> 2876.34]  that it would not come quietly,
[2877.46 --> 2880.82]  and how certain things needed to happen before Christ's second coming.
[2881.02 --> 2882.40]  Those things needed to take place.
[2882.78 --> 2887.64]  In today's text, Paul, in some ways, he kind of puts a little bow on this conversation
[2887.64 --> 2891.04]  by reminding this church of some very important things,
[2891.80 --> 2893.76]  mainly their identity.
[2893.76 --> 2898.32]  The reminder is our big idea from this text today.
[2898.32 --> 2903.78]  By remembering our God-given identity and God's sure calling,
[2904.38 --> 2908.60]  we are set free to stand firm and live boldly.
[2909.66 --> 2914.32]  The Thessalonian church was confused and they were looking for some certainty.
[2915.80 --> 2919.66]  Now, confusion and certainty, they are at opposite ends, aren't they?
[2919.66 --> 2923.78]  This is something that Christians have wrestled with forever, I think.
[2923.82 --> 2924.90]  Not just Christians, actually.
[2925.06 --> 2928.52]  This is something that humanity wrestles with, isn't it?
[2928.76 --> 2929.44]  I mean, look at me.
[2929.48 --> 2930.68]  I'm confused all the time.
[2931.38 --> 2932.94]  Confusion is just part of the package.
[2933.24 --> 2934.12]  It's just part of life.
[2934.36 --> 2935.62]  When I was at Redeemer, actually,
[2935.92 --> 2940.34]  I once had two exams on one day at the end of my semester.
[2941.22 --> 2943.06]  I had two exams on one day.
[2943.06 --> 2946.64]  An afternoon exam and an evening exam.
[2947.04 --> 2947.86]  And I thought to myself,
[2948.02 --> 2949.86]  well, the day before those two exams,
[2950.06 --> 2952.52]  I'll just hang out in my room and cram all day,
[2952.84 --> 2954.82]  you know, studying like you're studying should be done.
[2956.86 --> 2959.34]  But then my roommate that morning, 8 a.m.,
[2959.34 --> 2961.04]  popped his head into my room, Randall,
[2961.68 --> 2962.32]  and he says,
[2962.40 --> 2964.86]  Kevin, I'm going to watch all three extended versions
[2964.86 --> 2966.42]  of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
[2966.60 --> 2967.94]  Do you want to watch those with me?
[2968.56 --> 2970.30]  And obviously I said yes.
[2970.82 --> 2972.66]  I just figured Tolkien was a smart dude.
[2972.66 --> 2974.38]  I'd probably learn through osmosis somehow
[2974.38 --> 2976.62]  by what he was putting on the screen.
[2976.80 --> 2977.82]  Speaking of the Lord of the Rings,
[2977.90 --> 2978.86]  just a little bit of a side,
[2978.92 --> 2979.82]  and speaking of confusion,
[2980.30 --> 2982.46]  I know I was confused the first and last time
[2982.46 --> 2984.12]  I tried to make my way through those books.
[2984.40 --> 2985.16]  I don't know if you were.
[2985.52 --> 2988.02]  Between the Boromirs and Foromirs
[2988.02 --> 2990.18]  and Saramons and Sorons,
[2990.24 --> 2990.86]  I couldn't hack it.
[2991.36 --> 2992.52]  Anyways, the movies were good.
[2992.98 --> 2994.20]  And so I sat down with Randall
[2994.20 --> 2995.80]  and we hammered through all three movies
[2995.80 --> 2997.06]  14 hours that day,
[2997.08 --> 2997.68]  and I went to bed.
[2998.60 --> 2999.96]  I woke up the next day.
[2999.96 --> 3002.06]  I showed up for my 2 p.m. exam.
[3002.66 --> 3004.06]  I was instantly confused.
[3004.98 --> 3006.16]  I was instantly confused
[3006.16 --> 3007.06]  because I looked around
[3007.06 --> 3008.92]  and there was not a person from my class there.
[3009.94 --> 3011.38]  After I sniffed around a bit,
[3011.72 --> 3013.56]  I realized that my 2 p.m. exam
[3013.56 --> 3015.90]  was actually a 9 a.m. exam,
[3016.12 --> 3019.10]  and I was five hours late and missed it.
[3019.82 --> 3019.98]  Yeah.
[3021.30 --> 3022.36]  Long story short,
[3022.78 --> 3025.58]  I got to meet with the education committee right away.
[3025.94 --> 3027.70]  I was completely honest with them.
[3027.70 --> 3028.98]  I told them the whole story
[3028.98 --> 3030.86]  right down to the Gandalfs and the Dumbledores
[3030.86 --> 3033.64]  and how it was an honest-to-goodness mistake,
[3033.86 --> 3035.10]  and for some reason,
[3035.60 --> 3036.60]  they took pity on me,
[3036.76 --> 3039.20]  and they let me take that exam
[3039.20 --> 3040.04]  right then and there
[3040.04 --> 3041.12]  with just some minor penalties.
[3041.56 --> 3044.26]  They were gracious amidst my confusion.
[3045.38 --> 3046.42]  I finished that exam up
[3046.42 --> 3047.58]  just in time to take the second one.
[3047.64 --> 3049.52]  I have no idea how well I did on either of them,
[3049.56 --> 3050.24]  but here I am now,
[3050.32 --> 3051.34]  so it couldn't have been that bad.
[3051.34 --> 3054.74]  But confusion happens, right?
[3055.20 --> 3056.40]  We all get confused,
[3056.60 --> 3058.18]  sometimes by our own doing,
[3058.54 --> 3060.68]  sometimes by the influence of others,
[3060.68 --> 3061.48]  like Randall.
[3062.28 --> 3065.60]  We have moments of confusion
[3065.60 --> 3067.66]  in our Christian lives too,
[3068.50 --> 3069.32]  moments of doubt.
[3069.92 --> 3072.96]  We try to wrap our heads around God,
[3073.06 --> 3074.12]  around His world,
[3074.58 --> 3075.58]  around His Word,
[3075.98 --> 3077.58]  around our rules within it,
[3078.16 --> 3080.56]  and we all naturally actually think of God,
[3080.56 --> 3083.04]  and we limit Him to our own stories
[3083.04 --> 3084.20]  and our own contexts.
[3084.52 --> 3086.38]  And sometimes this brings confusion
[3086.38 --> 3087.48]  in our walks with God.
[3087.70 --> 3089.66]  There can be confusion about God's will
[3089.66 --> 3090.90]  for our lives, for example,
[3090.98 --> 3094.44]  or confusion about how suffering happens
[3094.44 --> 3096.56]  and why it's a part of our life.
[3096.66 --> 3098.68]  Confusion about church and community
[3098.68 --> 3099.92]  and why that's important.
[3100.58 --> 3102.12]  Confusion about our identity
[3102.12 --> 3104.14]  and who we are.
[3105.14 --> 3106.52]  Confusion strikes all of us.
[3107.92 --> 3109.64]  A lot of the Thessalonians' confusion,
[3109.64 --> 3113.22]  though, stemmed from their lack of understanding
[3113.22 --> 3115.38]  of their own spiritual identity.
[3116.66 --> 3118.24]  Like I said, this can happen to us too,
[3118.50 --> 3120.00]  perhaps even especially
[3120.00 --> 3122.12]  to long-time Christians.
[3122.70 --> 3124.62]  People who have given their lives to Christ
[3124.62 --> 3126.00]  so long ago
[3126.00 --> 3127.86]  that the truth of the gospel
[3127.86 --> 3128.86]  has actually started
[3128.86 --> 3130.44]  to feel a little bit bland,
[3131.06 --> 3132.22]  a little bit mundane,
[3132.84 --> 3134.76]  and it starts to fall on numb ears.
[3134.76 --> 3138.00]  We forget about Christ's life,
[3138.32 --> 3139.26]  death, and resurrection,
[3139.54 --> 3141.04]  and what it means for us.
[3141.56 --> 3142.72]  We become apathetic
[3142.72 --> 3144.30]  and we forget the power
[3144.30 --> 3145.22]  that we live with,
[3145.58 --> 3147.08]  the victory that's been won,
[3147.22 --> 3148.92]  or the purpose with which we live.
[3150.56 --> 3151.84]  And then we end up listening
[3151.84 --> 3153.44]  to some preacher someone recommended,
[3153.86 --> 3155.28]  or you hear something on the news,
[3155.38 --> 3156.48]  or we get caught up
[3156.48 --> 3158.08]  on some online forum,
[3158.08 --> 3159.58]  and we engage it
[3159.58 --> 3161.34]  with just a little bit too much chutzpah,
[3161.54 --> 3163.54]  and then confusion starts to set in.
[3165.46 --> 3166.60]  And we get confused
[3166.60 --> 3167.82]  by the world around us,
[3167.92 --> 3169.08]  confused by politics
[3169.64 --> 3171.08]  and popular opinions
[3171.08 --> 3172.46]  and posts online.
[3172.66 --> 3174.24]  We start looking for certainty
[3174.24 --> 3175.88]  in the wrong places.
[3176.66 --> 3178.42]  And we start believing in lies
[3178.42 --> 3180.58]  which are dressed up as virtues.
[3180.58 --> 3184.56]  We're promised all sorts
[3184.56 --> 3185.74]  of certainties in this world,
[3186.54 --> 3188.30]  certainties that sound really good
[3188.30 --> 3188.94]  on the surface,
[3189.54 --> 3192.12]  but they can be deceptive at their core,
[3192.60 --> 3193.78]  even really good things.
[3195.20 --> 3196.72]  An education ensures
[3196.72 --> 3198.74]  that you will have a secure job
[3198.74 --> 3199.42]  with high earnings.
[3200.58 --> 3201.58]  Your marriage guarantees
[3202.34 --> 3203.40]  a life of happiness.
[3204.68 --> 3206.62]  If you just alter one thing
[3206.62 --> 3207.42]  about yourself,
[3207.86 --> 3209.86]  people will certainly accept you.
[3211.58 --> 3213.28]  Comfort is surely found
[3213.28 --> 3214.86]  in one more hour of gaming,
[3215.20 --> 3217.02]  one more pull of that slot machine,
[3217.34 --> 3219.16]  one more trip to that plastic surgeon,
[3219.48 --> 3220.48]  one more investment
[3220.48 --> 3221.52]  in the right portfolio.
[3223.26 --> 3224.36]  And the truth is,
[3224.44 --> 3225.32]  none of that is certain.
[3226.86 --> 3228.16]  Education is important,
[3228.86 --> 3229.38]  absolutely,
[3229.84 --> 3231.40]  but it doesn't guarantee you anything.
[3232.90 --> 3234.26]  Relationships are vital,
[3235.20 --> 3236.92]  but they're often the source
[3236.92 --> 3237.56]  of our suffering.
[3238.30 --> 3239.28]  Don't always come with happiness.
[3240.58 --> 3242.26]  Changing your identity
[3242.26 --> 3244.12]  or values to be accepted by others
[3244.12 --> 3246.20]  cheapens who you've been created to be
[3246.20 --> 3248.46]  and often creates more confusion
[3248.46 --> 3249.66]  than what you find yourself in.
[3251.08 --> 3252.88]  And comfort, in my opinion,
[3253.10 --> 3254.72]  is the greatest idol
[3254.72 --> 3256.04]  that our world seeks.
[3257.66 --> 3258.66]  They're all lies,
[3258.86 --> 3260.02]  and they're all masquerading
[3260.02 --> 3261.68]  as certainties in our world.
[3261.68 --> 3264.22]  And all of those supposed certainties
[3264.22 --> 3265.08]  and all of those supposed certainties
[3265.08 --> 3268.18]  end up bringing just more confusion.
[3270.66 --> 3271.78]  In our confusion,
[3271.94 --> 3273.30]  we seek those certainties,
[3273.78 --> 3275.86]  but those certainties are often lies
[3275.86 --> 3277.66]  or they're just too far away
[3277.66 --> 3278.48]  for us to grasp.
[3278.48 --> 3282.10]  But maybe,
[3282.40 --> 3284.02]  in our confusion,
[3285.02 --> 3288.14]  instead of seeking certainties,
[3288.64 --> 3290.82]  we need to seek what Paul is offering
[3290.82 --> 3292.78]  the Thessalonian church in our text today.
[3294.04 --> 3296.26]  See, Paul didn't give them certainties.
[3297.58 --> 3299.16]  He gives them clarity.
[3299.16 --> 3302.96]  So maybe instead for us,
[3303.64 --> 3305.58]  instead of striving for certainties,
[3306.16 --> 3309.72]  we also need just a little bit of clarity.
[3311.70 --> 3313.80]  See, Paul provides this church with clarity
[3313.80 --> 3315.26]  in the midst of their confusion.
[3315.58 --> 3317.02]  When certainty wasn't cutting it,
[3317.20 --> 3319.12]  when the church was looking for certainty
[3319.12 --> 3320.76]  on specific details
[3320.76 --> 3324.10]  as to the who's and the how's and the when's.
[3324.16 --> 3325.28]  For example, if you remember,
[3325.56 --> 3327.14]  who is this man of lawlessness?
[3327.14 --> 3327.76]  They wanted to know,
[3327.90 --> 3330.42]  how will we know we didn't miss Christ's return?
[3330.72 --> 3332.56]  When is all of this going to happen?
[3332.94 --> 3334.38]  Paul doesn't give them certainties.
[3335.46 --> 3338.02]  He doesn't answer those questions with certainties.
[3338.90 --> 3340.62]  But he does provide clarity.
[3342.24 --> 3343.78]  Clarity was going to stabilize them.
[3343.92 --> 3345.80]  Clarity over certainty.
[3346.64 --> 3348.94]  And he provides this clarity
[3348.94 --> 3351.10]  in the form of encouragement.
[3351.60 --> 3353.18]  He encourages this church.
[3353.50 --> 3354.94]  Verse 13 of our text,
[3355.00 --> 3355.46]  it says this,
[3355.46 --> 3358.54]  We ought always to thank God for you,
[3358.68 --> 3359.36]  brothers and sisters,
[3359.78 --> 3360.62]  loved by the Lord
[3360.62 --> 3363.20]  because God chose you as firstfruits
[3363.20 --> 3366.90]  to be saved through the sanctifying work
[3366.90 --> 3367.76]  of the Spirit
[3367.76 --> 3369.48]  and through belief in the truth.
[3370.26 --> 3370.96]  Notice, though,
[3370.98 --> 3372.58]  what Paul is gracious for here.
[3374.14 --> 3375.86]  He is thankful for these people,
[3375.94 --> 3377.06]  but he's not thankful
[3377.06 --> 3379.44]  for what they have done.
[3380.42 --> 3382.72]  He's not grateful because of their work,
[3382.72 --> 3385.44]  but because of God's work,
[3385.64 --> 3387.46]  because God chose them to be saved.
[3387.66 --> 3389.38]  He chose them to be sanctified.
[3389.72 --> 3391.36]  Paul's gratitude from this church,
[3391.58 --> 3392.82]  from 2 Thessalonians,
[3393.00 --> 3394.68]  actually mirrors the gratitude
[3394.68 --> 3396.22]  he gives at the beginning
[3396.22 --> 3397.94]  of 1 Thessalonians,
[3398.00 --> 3400.16]  way back into our first sermon
[3400.16 --> 3401.42]  in this sermon series,
[3401.62 --> 3403.42]  in 1 Thessalonians 1, verse 3.
[3403.86 --> 3404.88]  There, Paul mentions
[3404.88 --> 3406.42]  how grateful he is for this church.
[3406.42 --> 3407.42]  But again,
[3407.42 --> 3410.18]  his gratitude is not based
[3410.18 --> 3411.46]  on what they are doing,
[3412.46 --> 3415.02]  but on what Jesus had already done.
[3415.58 --> 3417.44]  He is grateful for this church
[3417.44 --> 3418.68]  because of the work of Christ.
[3419.44 --> 3421.48]  The church can only know
[3421.48 --> 3422.26]  who we really are
[3422.26 --> 3424.38]  when we remember who Christ is.
[3424.64 --> 3426.66]  Only the transforming work of Christ,
[3426.76 --> 3429.04]  the work that he has already done,
[3430.12 --> 3431.54]  can combat this confusion,
[3431.68 --> 3433.56]  can combat the deceptive work
[3433.56 --> 3434.50]  of the Antichrist
[3434.50 --> 3435.60]  or the man of lawlessness
[3435.60 --> 3437.12]  or Satan and his minions.
[3437.50 --> 3439.22]  Only the truth of Jesus
[3439.22 --> 3441.92]  can combat an apathetic faith.
[3442.72 --> 3443.92]  We need reminding
[3443.92 --> 3445.26]  of this transformation.
[3445.54 --> 3446.42]  We need to remember
[3446.42 --> 3449.02]  who Christ claims us to be.
[3451.38 --> 3452.90]  See, the clarity this provides
[3452.90 --> 3453.46]  is crucial.
[3453.64 --> 3454.72]  It grounds us.
[3455.08 --> 3457.00]  It quiets the storms.
[3457.44 --> 3459.26]  And it dissipates the confusion.
[3461.26 --> 3462.72]  Paul reminds us
[3462.72 --> 3463.66]  that for believers,
[3463.66 --> 3466.42]  salvation is not
[3466.42 --> 3468.36]  a subjective experience.
[3470.48 --> 3471.74]  Salvation is not something
[3471.74 --> 3473.86]  the church has to train for
[3473.86 --> 3474.66]  in order to experience.
[3474.84 --> 3475.36]  It's not something
[3475.36 --> 3476.72]  that believers can miss
[3476.72 --> 3478.06]  if we aren't paying attention.
[3478.24 --> 3479.56]  Salvation is not something
[3479.56 --> 3481.28]  anyone has to work for
[3481.28 --> 3482.28]  and earn.
[3482.44 --> 3483.92]  No, salvation is not
[3483.92 --> 3485.62]  a subjective experience.
[3487.16 --> 3489.94]  Salvation is an objective position.
[3489.94 --> 3493.26]  salvation is given to us.
[3494.22 --> 3495.80]  It's a gift given to us
[3495.80 --> 3496.34]  by our God
[3496.34 --> 3498.86]  which changes our position
[3498.86 --> 3499.94]  in the kingdom.
[3500.46 --> 3502.20]  Our positional standing
[3502.20 --> 3503.30]  before the judge,
[3503.40 --> 3504.88]  our very identities,
[3505.08 --> 3505.92]  the most eternal
[3505.92 --> 3507.22]  and important part
[3507.22 --> 3508.24]  of who we are
[3508.24 --> 3510.72]  has been clearly decided
[3510.72 --> 3511.72]  already
[3511.72 --> 3515.92]  by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[3515.92 --> 3518.14]  We have been given
[3518.14 --> 3520.30]  clarity and assurance
[3520.30 --> 3521.52]  for our present
[3521.52 --> 3523.14]  and eternal selves
[3523.14 --> 3523.94]  that our identities
[3523.94 --> 3525.06]  are rooted in Christ
[3525.06 --> 3526.52]  and we belong to Him.
[3526.62 --> 3527.52]  He chose us.
[3527.62 --> 3528.46]  We are His.
[3531.46 --> 3532.66]  Paul, in a different letter
[3532.66 --> 3533.50]  to a different church,
[3533.68 --> 3535.14]  in Ephesians 2,
[3535.22 --> 3536.18]  verses 4 and 5,
[3536.24 --> 3536.86]  he says this.
[3537.90 --> 3538.32]  He says,
[3538.32 --> 3540.14]  but because of His
[3540.14 --> 3541.78]  great love for us,
[3542.24 --> 3543.60]  God who is rich in mercy
[3543.60 --> 3545.40]  made us alive with Christ
[3545.40 --> 3546.80]  even when we were dead
[3546.80 --> 3547.66]  in transgression.
[3547.92 --> 3548.88]  It is by grace
[3548.88 --> 3549.84]  that you have been saved.
[3550.14 --> 3551.36]  Not by our love
[3551.36 --> 3553.12]  or our deeds
[3553.12 --> 3554.18]  or our response
[3554.18 --> 3555.10]  or our doing,
[3556.00 --> 3557.40]  but because of His
[3557.40 --> 3559.88]  great love for us,
[3560.14 --> 3561.74]  God made us alive
[3561.74 --> 3562.66]  in Christ
[3562.66 --> 3564.00]  even when we were dead
[3564.00 --> 3564.54]  in sins.
[3565.24 --> 3566.26]  It is by grace
[3566.26 --> 3567.22]  that you have been saved.
[3568.86 --> 3570.70]  This is our clarity.
[3571.78 --> 3573.82]  As soon as God chose you,
[3573.98 --> 3575.44]  your objective position
[3575.44 --> 3576.72]  in the kingdom changed.
[3577.26 --> 3578.88]  That is the sanctifying work
[3578.88 --> 3579.44]  of the Spirit
[3579.44 --> 3580.44]  Paul is talking about
[3580.44 --> 3581.04]  in this text.
[3581.28 --> 3582.18]  Again, verse 13,
[3582.48 --> 3583.16]  God chose you
[3583.16 --> 3583.82]  as firstfruits
[3583.82 --> 3584.40]  to be saved
[3584.40 --> 3586.48]  through the sanctifying work
[3586.48 --> 3587.78]  of the Spirit
[3587.78 --> 3588.40]  and through belief
[3588.40 --> 3588.82]  in the truth.
[3589.12 --> 3590.48]  You are declared as gods.
[3591.16 --> 3592.00]  Sin no longer
[3592.00 --> 3592.88]  rules your life.
[3593.62 --> 3594.62]  We are no longer
[3594.62 --> 3595.84]  bound to sin,
[3595.90 --> 3596.52]  but we are bound
[3596.52 --> 3597.10]  to Christ.
[3597.10 --> 3598.10]  Our position
[3598.10 --> 3599.54]  has changed forever.
[3600.34 --> 3601.20]  That's the clarity
[3601.20 --> 3601.84]  Paul is bringing
[3601.84 --> 3602.80]  to light to this church.
[3604.54 --> 3605.86]  Now, this sanctification
[3605.86 --> 3607.10]  is called
[3607.10 --> 3608.74]  a definitive sanctification.
[3608.94 --> 3609.60]  It's different than
[3609.60 --> 3611.16]  progressive sanctification,
[3611.32 --> 3611.82]  which is also
[3611.82 --> 3612.64]  a very good thing,
[3612.76 --> 3613.56]  but not the good thing
[3613.56 --> 3614.24]  that Paul is talking
[3614.24 --> 3614.72]  about here.
[3615.16 --> 3615.66]  Picture this.
[3615.84 --> 3616.44]  Stay with me here.
[3616.50 --> 3616.94]  Picture this.
[3617.40 --> 3618.20]  Pretend with me
[3618.20 --> 3618.80]  for a second.
[3620.00 --> 3621.12]  Pretend you're in prison.
[3621.12 --> 3623.74]  You are bound
[3623.74 --> 3625.26]  to the prison warden
[3625.26 --> 3626.20]  because of the crime
[3626.20 --> 3626.94]  that you have committed.
[3628.00 --> 3628.86]  The prison
[3628.86 --> 3630.68]  and the prison warden
[3630.68 --> 3632.26]  controls and oversees
[3632.26 --> 3633.10]  everything you do.
[3633.18 --> 3634.38]  You are bound to him.
[3635.76 --> 3636.70]  But then one day
[3636.70 --> 3637.14]  you're freed.
[3638.30 --> 3639.36]  The gates open
[3639.36 --> 3640.02]  and you're released.
[3641.48 --> 3643.08]  Your position changes.
[3644.36 --> 3645.20]  You are free.
[3645.38 --> 3646.22]  You're no longer
[3646.22 --> 3647.76]  under the warden's control.
[3647.76 --> 3649.96]  That's definitive
[3649.96 --> 3651.14]  sanctification.
[3651.36 --> 3652.08]  That's what Paul
[3652.08 --> 3653.10]  is trying to make clear.
[3653.44 --> 3654.24]  Your position
[3654.24 --> 3655.48]  has changed forever.
[3656.68 --> 3657.64]  Yes, you're free
[3657.64 --> 3658.48]  from prison now
[3658.48 --> 3659.40]  and now you must learn
[3659.40 --> 3659.90]  how to live
[3659.90 --> 3660.82]  as a free person
[3660.82 --> 3661.62]  in society.
[3661.98 --> 3662.76]  That process
[3662.76 --> 3663.74]  is also happening
[3663.74 --> 3664.82]  and that process
[3664.82 --> 3665.20]  is called
[3665.20 --> 3666.42]  progressive sanctification
[3666.42 --> 3667.14]  where the Spirit
[3667.14 --> 3668.22]  takes over
[3668.22 --> 3669.48]  and makes us
[3669.48 --> 3670.26]  more and more
[3670.26 --> 3670.98]  Christ-like.
[3671.06 --> 3671.92]  But you are free.
[3672.76 --> 3673.56]  That is true.
[3673.70 --> 3674.74]  Your positional standing
[3674.74 --> 3675.30]  is clear.
[3675.70 --> 3676.46]  You're out of prison.
[3676.56 --> 3677.32]  There's no doubt
[3677.32 --> 3679.20]  you are free.
[3680.60 --> 3681.96]  Because of Christ
[3681.96 --> 3683.90]  you are free.
[3684.92 --> 3686.00]  You're no longer
[3686.00 --> 3686.72]  bound to sin.
[3686.92 --> 3688.20]  No longer bound to death.
[3688.36 --> 3689.68]  Paul assures us
[3689.68 --> 3690.68]  that we are sanctified
[3690.68 --> 3691.80]  because of Christ.
[3692.96 --> 3693.98]  And Paul gives
[3693.98 --> 3694.88]  thanks for that.
[3694.98 --> 3695.76]  For us too.
[3696.34 --> 3697.30]  Just like we can
[3697.30 --> 3697.74]  give thanks
[3697.74 --> 3698.46]  for one another.
[3698.78 --> 3699.60]  Because of what
[3699.60 --> 3700.48]  Christ has done.
[3701.52 --> 3702.32]  Because Jesus
[3702.32 --> 3704.16]  lived a perfect life
[3704.16 --> 3704.90]  that we failed
[3704.90 --> 3705.44]  to live
[3705.44 --> 3706.14]  and then he died
[3706.14 --> 3706.50]  to death
[3706.50 --> 3707.72]  that we all deserve.
[3708.66 --> 3709.76]  But then three days later
[3709.76 --> 3710.76]  Jesus rose again
[3710.76 --> 3711.30]  from the dead
[3711.30 --> 3712.20]  defeating sin
[3712.20 --> 3713.10]  and death.
[3716.30 --> 3717.64]  He's chosen you.
[3718.94 --> 3719.94]  Because of all
[3719.94 --> 3720.72]  that Jesus did
[3720.72 --> 3721.56]  he chose you.
[3721.96 --> 3722.62]  You are free.
[3723.04 --> 3724.26]  This releases us
[3724.26 --> 3725.90]  from the distraction
[3725.90 --> 3727.34]  of our uncertain futures.
[3728.18 --> 3729.68]  This clarifies
[3729.68 --> 3730.72]  our standing
[3730.72 --> 3731.58]  in God's eyes.
[3731.90 --> 3732.76]  We are liberated.
[3732.76 --> 3734.26]  We have been released
[3734.26 --> 3735.02]  from captivity.
[3735.54 --> 3736.82]  We are not our own
[3736.82 --> 3737.76]  but we belong
[3737.76 --> 3738.86]  body and soul
[3738.86 --> 3740.26]  in life and in death
[3740.26 --> 3741.38]  to our faithful Savior
[3741.38 --> 3742.24]  Jesus Christ.
[3742.44 --> 3743.46]  He has fully paid
[3743.46 --> 3744.64]  for all of our sins
[3744.64 --> 3746.22]  with his precious blood
[3746.22 --> 3748.10]  and he has set us free
[3748.10 --> 3748.84]  from the power
[3748.84 --> 3749.36]  of the devil
[3749.36 --> 3750.74]  by his Holy Spirit.
[3751.28 --> 3752.84]  We are assured.
[3754.16 --> 3755.62]  He makes clear to us
[3755.62 --> 3756.82]  our eternal life
[3756.82 --> 3758.88]  and makes us heartily willing
[3758.88 --> 3760.44]  and ready from now on
[3760.44 --> 3761.08]  to live for him.
[3762.46 --> 3764.56]  And that clarity
[3764.56 --> 3766.42]  cuts through the confusion.
[3769.68 --> 3772.08]  Now when we suffer
[3772.08 --> 3774.52]  we know we will be healed
[3774.52 --> 3775.46]  one day
[3775.46 --> 3777.08]  either here and now
[3777.08 --> 3778.18]  in this broken world
[3778.18 --> 3779.64]  or later with Christ
[3779.64 --> 3780.66]  on the new earth.
[3781.96 --> 3783.34]  Now when we grieve
[3783.34 --> 3784.34]  the loss of those
[3784.34 --> 3785.30]  who loved the Lord
[3785.30 --> 3786.58]  we can look forward
[3786.58 --> 3787.68]  with clarity
[3787.68 --> 3789.36]  that they too
[3789.36 --> 3790.50]  belong to Jesus
[3790.50 --> 3791.62]  in this life
[3791.62 --> 3792.16]  and the next.
[3793.40 --> 3794.50]  When we pray
[3794.50 --> 3795.76]  for those who do not
[3795.76 --> 3796.30]  know the Lord
[3796.30 --> 3797.14]  we can pray
[3797.14 --> 3798.12]  clearly
[3798.12 --> 3799.60]  and boldly
[3799.60 --> 3800.92]  and preach the gospel
[3800.92 --> 3801.54]  to them
[3801.54 --> 3802.40]  with conviction
[3802.40 --> 3803.46]  because we know
[3803.46 --> 3804.84]  that it's the Holy Spirit
[3804.84 --> 3806.20]  that softens hearts.
[3807.64 --> 3809.12]  And we can rejoice
[3809.12 --> 3809.72]  in victories.
[3809.86 --> 3810.48]  We can boast
[3810.48 --> 3811.28]  in the Lord
[3811.28 --> 3812.76]  for all he has done.
[3812.76 --> 3816.48]  whenever life's challenges
[3816.48 --> 3817.44]  get thrown our way
[3817.44 --> 3818.30]  we can mourn
[3818.30 --> 3819.32]  and we can grieve
[3819.32 --> 3820.16]  and we can lament
[3820.16 --> 3821.70]  and we can even be angry.
[3822.88 --> 3824.16]  But we can do so
[3824.16 --> 3825.00]  with clarity
[3825.00 --> 3826.40]  because God
[3826.40 --> 3827.62]  has us.
[3829.12 --> 3830.02]  We are
[3830.02 --> 3830.66]  his
[3830.66 --> 3831.98]  clearly.
[3834.90 --> 3836.14]  The Thessalonian church
[3836.14 --> 3837.08]  didn't need certainty
[3837.08 --> 3838.02]  they needed clarity.
[3838.42 --> 3839.24]  They were concerned
[3839.24 --> 3840.44]  about the when
[3840.44 --> 3841.72]  of Christ's return.
[3841.72 --> 3842.98]  what exactly
[3842.98 --> 3843.78]  the Antichrist
[3843.78 --> 3844.26]  would look like
[3844.26 --> 3846.16]  and how the great rebellion
[3846.16 --> 3846.94]  would unfold
[3846.94 --> 3848.00]  to the world around them.
[3848.04 --> 3848.54]  They were hoping
[3848.54 --> 3849.40]  for a road map.
[3850.52 --> 3851.04]  But Paul doesn't
[3851.04 --> 3851.56]  give them that.
[3852.28 --> 3853.60]  He doesn't unravel
[3853.60 --> 3855.08]  the mysteries of God.
[3855.26 --> 3855.72]  How could he?
[3855.78 --> 3857.18]  God is far too big
[3857.18 --> 3857.78]  to be condensed
[3857.78 --> 3858.70]  onto a road map.
[3859.94 --> 3860.68]  We don't know
[3860.68 --> 3861.24]  all the details.
[3861.66 --> 3862.12]  We don't know
[3862.12 --> 3863.08]  about when Christ will come.
[3863.18 --> 3863.96]  Matthew 24
[3863.96 --> 3865.48]  But concerning that day
[3865.48 --> 3865.94]  and hour
[3865.94 --> 3866.60]  no one knows
[3866.60 --> 3867.88]  not even the angels
[3867.88 --> 3868.36]  of heaven
[3868.36 --> 3869.32]  nor the Son
[3869.32 --> 3870.94]  but the Father only.
[3871.72 --> 3873.36]  Instead
[3873.36 --> 3874.28]  Paul points
[3874.28 --> 3874.88]  this church
[3874.88 --> 3875.44]  back to what
[3875.44 --> 3876.58]  they already knew
[3876.58 --> 3879.30]  and what really matters
[3879.30 --> 3880.88]  that they belong
[3880.88 --> 3881.72]  to God.
[3882.26 --> 3882.90]  Their standing
[3882.90 --> 3883.52]  in Christ
[3883.52 --> 3884.80]  is secure.
[3886.46 --> 3887.44]  And sometimes
[3887.44 --> 3888.72]  the most pastoral thing
[3888.72 --> 3889.58]  we can all do
[3889.58 --> 3890.32]  for one another
[3890.32 --> 3891.20]  is not
[3891.20 --> 3892.76]  hand out road maps
[3892.76 --> 3894.06]  or try to figure out
[3894.06 --> 3895.02]  the certainties
[3895.02 --> 3897.24]  but remind
[3897.24 --> 3898.24]  one another
[3898.24 --> 3900.78]  of the unshakable truth
[3900.78 --> 3902.98]  that we are His.
[3904.32 --> 3905.36]  Provide clarity.
[3907.66 --> 3908.36]  You'll notice
[3908.36 --> 3908.94]  Paul's actually
[3908.94 --> 3909.60]  really brief
[3909.60 --> 3910.32]  in this passage
[3910.32 --> 3911.84]  and that's intentional.
[3912.12 --> 3912.52]  He had already
[3912.52 --> 3913.42]  taught them these things.
[3914.18 --> 3915.00]  He had written
[3915.00 --> 3915.56]  to them before.
[3915.66 --> 3916.26]  He had instructed
[3916.26 --> 3916.92]  them in person.
[3917.26 --> 3917.90]  They weren't hearing
[3917.90 --> 3918.90]  this for the first time.
[3919.02 --> 3919.50]  They just needed
[3919.50 --> 3920.16]  to hear it again.
[3921.46 --> 3922.22]  And honestly
[3922.22 --> 3923.20]  isn't that true for us?
[3923.20 --> 3924.20]  How many of us
[3924.20 --> 3925.18]  need to be reminded
[3925.18 --> 3926.52]  instead of re-taught?
[3926.88 --> 3927.80]  I know a lot of us
[3927.80 --> 3928.64]  have grown up here
[3928.64 --> 3930.10]  hearing about God's love,
[3930.52 --> 3931.58]  hearing about His promises,
[3931.74 --> 3932.66]  our identity in Christ,
[3932.72 --> 3934.28]  but life fogs it up.
[3935.30 --> 3936.52]  Confusion can creep in.
[3937.30 --> 3938.24]  The noise of the world
[3938.24 --> 3938.78]  turns up
[3938.78 --> 3939.32]  and so God
[3939.32 --> 3939.94]  in His kindness
[3939.94 --> 3941.18]  often sends someone
[3941.18 --> 3941.84]  like Paul
[3941.84 --> 3942.86]  to pull us aside
[3942.86 --> 3943.08]  and say,
[3943.16 --> 3944.06]  you know this.
[3945.06 --> 3946.24]  Now remember it.
[3947.52 --> 3948.24]  Live it.
[3951.60 --> 3952.76]  And there's also
[3952.76 --> 3954.12]  some of us
[3954.12 --> 3954.64]  who don't know
[3954.64 --> 3955.42]  this truth yet.
[3956.26 --> 3957.32]  Some of us here today
[3957.32 --> 3958.50]  are wondering
[3958.50 --> 3960.20]  or you're curious.
[3960.68 --> 3961.34]  You're looking
[3961.34 --> 3962.48]  for certainties.
[3963.92 --> 3964.96]  And if that's you,
[3965.04 --> 3965.72]  I invite you
[3965.72 --> 3966.54]  keep wondering.
[3967.10 --> 3968.74]  Keep continuing
[3968.74 --> 3969.86]  in your curiosity.
[3970.82 --> 3971.70]  But don't look
[3971.70 --> 3972.44]  for certainties
[3972.44 --> 3973.02]  where mysteries
[3973.02 --> 3973.58]  are concerned.
[3973.70 --> 3973.96]  Instead,
[3974.36 --> 3975.58]  hold up the gospel
[3975.58 --> 3977.08]  in your hearts.
[3977.78 --> 3978.40]  Ask yourself,
[3978.68 --> 3979.44]  is Jesus
[3979.44 --> 3981.52]  who He says He is?
[3981.52 --> 3983.18]  Did He really do
[3983.18 --> 3984.04]  what He said He did?
[3984.88 --> 3985.88]  Are these people
[3985.88 --> 3986.76]  here in this room
[3986.76 --> 3987.16]  right now
[3987.16 --> 3988.18]  really saved
[3988.18 --> 3989.10]  because of the work
[3989.10 --> 3989.90]  of Jesus only?
[3993.04 --> 3994.46]  Are they really free?
[3995.64 --> 3996.78]  Are they really released
[3996.78 --> 3997.44]  from captivity?
[3997.98 --> 3998.70]  Is it that simple?
[4000.18 --> 4000.90]  I pray
[4000.90 --> 4001.90]  that if that is you,
[4001.94 --> 4002.78]  you find clarity
[4002.78 --> 4003.30]  of heart
[4003.30 --> 4004.14]  to see Jesus
[4004.14 --> 4005.10]  more clearly today.
[4006.14 --> 4007.10]  Because once
[4007.10 --> 4008.88]  that revelatory truth
[4008.88 --> 4009.82]  creeps into your heart,
[4009.82 --> 4010.80]  it changes everything.
[4013.52 --> 4014.60]  So there's the clarity
[4014.60 --> 4015.66]  for our minds today.
[4015.76 --> 4016.34]  There's the clarity
[4016.34 --> 4017.44]  for our hearts today.
[4017.50 --> 4018.22]  But what does that mean
[4018.22 --> 4018.86]  for our hands?
[4018.92 --> 4019.92]  Where do we go
[4019.92 --> 4021.22]  with this newfound
[4021.22 --> 4022.82]  or perhaps more appropriately,
[4023.34 --> 4025.38]  this newly reminded clarity?
[4026.18 --> 4027.58]  If we are truly secure,
[4027.94 --> 4029.02]  if we are truly loved
[4029.02 --> 4029.86]  and chosen and called,
[4029.92 --> 4031.26]  if our standing before God
[4031.26 --> 4032.28]  is not in doubt,
[4033.08 --> 4033.94]  then what do we do?
[4035.72 --> 4038.00]  Paul does tell us that
[4038.00 --> 4039.64]  in verse 15 of our text.
[4040.62 --> 4042.18]  We go in boldness.
[4042.98 --> 4044.12]  We stand firm.
[4044.20 --> 4045.70]  We hold to the teachings
[4045.70 --> 4046.66]  we've received.
[4046.84 --> 4047.74]  We live lives
[4047.74 --> 4049.28]  that reflect the truth
[4049.28 --> 4050.12]  that we've been given.
[4050.58 --> 4052.16]  That means showing up in love,
[4052.82 --> 4054.02]  holding fast to grace,
[4054.34 --> 4055.20]  speaking the truth
[4055.20 --> 4056.44]  in both boldness
[4056.44 --> 4057.70]  and in kindness
[4057.70 --> 4058.98]  with courage.
[4059.66 --> 4061.42]  That means we gather together.
[4061.56 --> 4062.92]  We grow in faith
[4062.92 --> 4064.42]  and we go out with purpose.
[4064.42 --> 4066.92]  We don't do that
[4066.92 --> 4067.50]  because we're trying
[4067.50 --> 4068.52]  to prove anything
[4068.52 --> 4069.84]  or earn something,
[4070.02 --> 4071.28]  but because we already
[4071.28 --> 4073.02]  know who we are.
[4073.38 --> 4074.50]  That much is clear.
[4076.44 --> 4077.78]  And here's the last
[4077.78 --> 4078.56]  beautiful thing.
[4079.68 --> 4080.84]  When we rest
[4080.84 --> 4081.54]  in that clarity,
[4082.24 --> 4083.92]  when we anchor ourselves
[4083.92 --> 4085.92]  in the who
[4085.92 --> 4087.04]  that is true
[4087.04 --> 4087.74]  and unchanging,
[4088.74 --> 4090.04]  the panic
[4090.04 --> 4091.28]  we start to feel
[4091.28 --> 4092.70]  about life's uncertainties
[4092.70 --> 4094.80]  begins to just quiet a little.
[4096.14 --> 4097.74]  The need for control,
[4098.24 --> 4099.76]  the thirst for answers,
[4099.92 --> 4100.50]  the stress
[4100.50 --> 4101.94]  over every what if,
[4102.66 --> 4104.00]  all of that just starts
[4104.00 --> 4105.10]  to loosen its grip.
[4106.56 --> 4107.92]  Because we know
[4107.92 --> 4109.02]  the one
[4109.02 --> 4110.50]  who holds our future.
[4111.78 --> 4113.00]  We're clear
[4113.00 --> 4114.14]  on where we stand.
[4115.12 --> 4115.94]  We're clear
[4115.94 --> 4117.18]  on who we belong to
[4117.18 --> 4118.94]  and what's awaiting for us.
[4118.94 --> 4121.84]  So whether we're laughing
[4121.84 --> 4122.72]  or we're grieving,
[4123.32 --> 4124.22]  whether we're healthy
[4124.22 --> 4125.02]  or we're hurting,
[4125.72 --> 4126.62]  whether we're certainly
[4126.62 --> 4128.50]  confused or confusingly certain,
[4129.48 --> 4131.32]  we can walk forward
[4131.32 --> 4132.28]  without fear.
[4132.54 --> 4133.22]  Not because
[4133.22 --> 4134.18]  all the details
[4134.18 --> 4134.72]  are certain,
[4136.00 --> 4136.58]  but because of
[4136.58 --> 4137.82]  the most important thing.
[4138.32 --> 4140.24]  We are God's.
[4140.98 --> 4142.16]  By remembering
[4142.16 --> 4143.70]  that God-given identity
[4143.70 --> 4145.50]  and God's sure calling
[4145.50 --> 4146.20]  on our lives,
[4146.20 --> 4147.66]  we are set free
[4147.66 --> 4149.28]  to stand firm
[4149.28 --> 4150.50]  and live boldly.
[4150.60 --> 4151.22]  So Emmanuel,
[4151.94 --> 4153.60]  may our Lord Jesus Christ
[4153.60 --> 4154.18]  himself
[4154.18 --> 4156.46]  and God our Father
[4156.46 --> 4157.98]  who loved us
[4157.98 --> 4159.10]  and by his grace
[4159.10 --> 4159.84]  gave us
[4159.84 --> 4160.96]  eternal encouragement
[4160.96 --> 4161.66]  and good hope
[4161.66 --> 4164.68]  encourage your hearts
[4164.68 --> 4166.26]  and strengthen you
[4166.26 --> 4168.94]  in every good deed
[4168.94 --> 4169.90]  and word.
[4170.62 --> 4170.88]  Amen.
[4171.66 --> 4172.60]  Please pray with me.
[4172.60 --> 4172.66]  Amen.
[4172.66 --> 4176.78]  Father God,
[4177.56 --> 4180.82]  in many areas of life
[4180.82 --> 4183.64]  we need you to encourage us.
[4184.02 --> 4185.40]  In other areas of life
[4185.40 --> 4186.62]  we need conviction.
[4186.86 --> 4187.48]  Sometimes we need
[4187.48 --> 4188.54]  a good kick in the pants.
[4190.00 --> 4190.62]  But God,
[4190.86 --> 4192.68]  what we all certainly need
[4192.68 --> 4194.92]  is just a little bit of clarity.
[4194.92 --> 4198.20]  may you
[4198.20 --> 4200.52]  and your truth
[4200.52 --> 4203.24]  permeate our hearts.
[4204.14 --> 4205.20]  May we know
[4205.20 --> 4206.34]  to our core
[4206.34 --> 4207.52]  that we are saved.
[4208.92 --> 4210.08]  That you have
[4210.08 --> 4211.06]  claimed us
[4211.06 --> 4211.90]  as your own
[4211.90 --> 4215.96]  and that we belong to you
[4215.96 --> 4217.94]  in life and in death
[4217.94 --> 4219.68]  with purpose
[4219.68 --> 4220.42]  and value.
[4221.52 --> 4222.06]  God,
[4222.12 --> 4222.82]  if this is a message
[4222.82 --> 4224.20]  we've heard a thousand times,
[4224.20 --> 4225.72]  may it sink
[4225.72 --> 4226.64]  a little deeper today.
[4227.68 --> 4228.70]  If this is a message
[4228.70 --> 4229.06]  we've heard
[4229.06 --> 4230.02]  for the first time,
[4231.08 --> 4232.08]  may we investigate
[4232.08 --> 4232.98]  a little bit further.
[4234.38 --> 4234.72]  And God,
[4234.78 --> 4235.40]  may we all
[4235.40 --> 4236.04]  in this room
[4236.04 --> 4236.62]  and beyond
[4236.62 --> 4237.94]  know your love,
[4238.38 --> 4239.16]  know your grace
[4239.16 --> 4240.38]  and live that out
[4240.38 --> 4241.44]  in the world around us.
[4241.88 --> 4242.58]  We pray this
[4242.58 --> 4243.20]  in your son's
[4243.20 --> 4244.42]  precious and holy name.
[4244.90 --> 4245.10]  Amen.
[4245.10 --> 4245.20]  Amen.
[4254.20 --> 4278.58]  This my only comfort
[4278.58 --> 4279.58]  is a blessing.
[4279.58 --> 4280.40]  I am not my own,
[4280.40 --> 4282.06]  but belong.
[4282.06 --> 4284.78]  You have fully paid
[4284.78 --> 4286.40]  for all my sins
[4286.40 --> 4288.26]  and all my death.
[4288.80 --> 4291.24]  Even when I struggle
[4291.24 --> 4293.06]  to believe,
[4295.06 --> 4297.32]  with your precious blood
[4297.32 --> 4299.10]  you set me free.
[4299.10 --> 4305.42]  I am not my own,
[4305.42 --> 4307.88]  but belong,
[4309.30 --> 4311.42]  body and soul,
[4312.42 --> 4315.06]  in my life
[4315.06 --> 4317.42]  and in death.
[4317.42 --> 4320.04]  to you,
[4320.04 --> 4321.24]  Lord,
[4321.68 --> 4325.52]  Christ my Lord.
[4325.98 --> 4328.26]  You preserve my life
[4328.26 --> 4329.60]  in such a way
[4329.60 --> 4331.38]  that without you,
[4332.10 --> 4334.00]  not a hair can fall
[4334.00 --> 4334.86]  from me
[4334.86 --> 4337.26]  unless you will it too.
[4338.06 --> 4340.18]  Even when I'm lost
[4340.18 --> 4342.70]  in desperation,
[4342.70 --> 4346.26]  all things work together
[4346.26 --> 4348.78]  for my salvation.
[4349.98 --> 4354.16]  I am not my own,
[4354.54 --> 4356.40]  but belong,
[4357.84 --> 4360.40]  body and soul,
[4360.80 --> 4363.40]  in my life
[4363.40 --> 4366.40]  and in death.
[4366.40 --> 4368.26]  To you,
[4368.46 --> 4369.46]  Lord,
[4369.86 --> 4372.40]  Christ my Lord.
[4372.70 --> 4399.56]  always by your Holy Spirit
[4399.56 --> 4401.26]  you assure me
[4401.26 --> 4404.60]  of eternal life
[4404.60 --> 4405.52]  and make me
[4405.52 --> 4407.32]  willing and ready
[4407.32 --> 4410.44]  even when I can't
[4410.44 --> 4412.10]  see my way through.
[4413.94 --> 4415.46]  From now on
[4415.46 --> 4417.88]  to always live for you.
[4421.42 --> 4425.36]  I am not my own,
[4425.36 --> 4427.64]  but belong,
[4427.64 --> 4431.98]  body and soul,
[4431.98 --> 4432.98]  in my life
[4432.98 --> 4436.98]  and in death.
[4436.98 --> 4437.98]  To you,
[4437.98 --> 4439.92]  Lord,
[4440.32 --> 4443.74]  Christ my Lord.
[4443.98 --> 4448.24]  I am not my own,
[4448.70 --> 4450.40]  but belong,
[4450.40 --> 4451.74]  body and soul,
[4451.74 --> 4453.74]  body and soul,
[4453.74 --> 4455.74]  in my life
[4455.74 --> 4456.74]  and in death.
[4456.74 --> 4457.74]  In my life
[4457.74 --> 4458.74]  and in death.
[4458.74 --> 4459.74]  In my life,
[4459.74 --> 4460.74]  and in death,
[4460.74 --> 4461.74]  to you,
[4461.74 --> 4462.74]  Lord,
[4462.74 --> 4466.74]  Christ my Lord.
[4466.74 --> 4468.08]  Lord,
[4468.08 --> 4471.08]  I am not my own,
[4471.08 --> 4472.08]  I am not my own,
[4472.08 --> 4474.08]  but belong,
[4474.08 --> 4477.08]  body and soul,
[4477.08 --> 4480.08]  in my life,
[4480.08 --> 4483.08]  and in death.
[4483.08 --> 4485.08]  To you,
[4485.08 --> 4486.08]  Lord,
[4486.08 --> 4490.08]  Christ my Lord.
[4490.08 --> 4505.30]  Amen.
[4507.42 --> 4509.00]  If you are looking for prayer this morning,
[4509.08 --> 4510.96]  there will be prayer people available here at the front,
[4511.02 --> 4512.02]  I think in the back as well,
[4512.08 --> 4513.02]  with a yellow name tag.
[4513.10 --> 4515.80]  Feel free to approach any of them for prayer today,
[4515.92 --> 4518.10]  or anybody else in this church as well.
[4518.10 --> 4520.08]  And as we go from this place,
[4520.14 --> 4521.26]  we go out with a purpose.
[4521.40 --> 4522.68]  We go out with clarity.
