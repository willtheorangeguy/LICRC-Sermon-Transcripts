[2169.52 → 2199.50] Good morning.
[2199.50 → 2229.48] All right.
[2229.48 → 2259.46] Thank you.
[2259.46 → 2289.46] Thank you.
[2289.46 → 2319.44] Thank you.
[2319.46 → 2349.46] Good morning.
[2349.46 → 2379.46] Thank you.
[2379.46 → 2409.44] Thank you.
[2409.46 → 2439.44] Thank you.
[2439.46 → 2469.44] May we remember.
[2469.44 → 2499.42] God, you're in the
[2499.42 → 2529.40] and we're in the actions of the
[2529.42 → 2559.40] and we pray.
[2559.42 → 2589.40] God, may you, may you, may we're in the
[2589.40 → 2619.40] and we pray, may we pray, may we pray,
[2619.40 → 2649.40] out,
[2649.40 → 2650.92] Heal her, too.
[2652.38 → 2654.28] Lord, we thank you for life and for new life.
[2654.36 → 2658.40] We thank you for little baby Ruth of Haley and Nathan, Lord.
[2658.44 → 2660.74] We thank you that all is well and that she is healthy.
[2660.80 → 2663.00] And we thank you for all of those who are pregnant right now, too.
[2664.24 → 2666.16] Lord, life is such a beautiful thing.
[2666.98 → 2669.42] Will you continue to be with those moms, those families,
[2669.66 → 2673.50] as you continue to grow new life here in this place?
[2673.50 → 2679.44] Forgive us our sins, God, as we forgive those who sin against us.
[2680.52 → 2682.54] Lord, may we truly forgive others.
[2683.66 → 2686.58] Place on our hearts right now those that we need to forgive.
[2688.22 → 2690.20] And God, may we seek forgiveness, too.
[2692.12 → 2695.32] May you place it on our hearts who we need to seek forgiveness from.
[2697.90 → 2701.16] Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.
[2701.16 → 2704.88] Continue to have us seek you first in all things, Lord.
[2704.96 → 2709.22] Draw us closer to you and keep us free from that which draws us elsewhere.
[2710.98 → 2714.86] And, Lord, as we open up your word today and learn more about what it means
[2714.86 → 2718.96] to follow you in this world where things seem so meaningless,
[2719.78 → 2721.20] we pray that you be with Pastor Chris.
[2722.00 → 2723.76] May he speak your words.
[2724.54 → 2727.30] And may you open up our ears and our hearts and our minds
[2727.30 → 2729.38] to what it is that you are teaching us today.
[2729.38 → 2735.10] For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever and ever.
[2735.78 → 2736.08] Amen.
[2736.08 → 2736.18] Amen.
[2736.18 → 2761.82] We have been working our way through the book of Ecclesiastes,
[2761.82 → 2770.54] struggling through what the wisdom of the teacher might be for our lives of faith today.
[2771.22 → 2774.64] This morning we're going to continue that with Ecclesiastes 7.
[2775.86 → 2781.20] I'm, in fact, going to read the first 25 verses of chapter 7.
[2781.34 → 2783.64] So, chapter 7, 1 through 25.
[2784.30 → 2787.66] And then we'll spend some time reflecting on that together.
[2787.66 → 2792.20] I encourage you, if you have a Bible either in your hands or on a device,
[2792.32 → 2794.44] to go ahead, open that up, and then to keep that open,
[2794.54 → 2796.50] because we'll make regular reference back.
[2796.68 → 2799.56] If you would like to grab one, there are some Bibles at the back there
[2799.56 → 2801.16] that you can use for this too.
[2802.68 → 2804.86] The first time through, we'll see it on the screen.
[2805.02 → 2805.78] Let's read together.
[2805.78 → 2813.04] A good name is better than fine perfume,
[2814.04 → 2818.02] and the day of death better than the day of birth.
[2819.14 → 2823.90] It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting,
[2824.02 → 2826.80] for death is the destiny of everyone,
[2827.16 → 2829.52] and the living should take this to heart.
[2829.52 → 2833.78] Frustration is better than laughter,
[2833.78 → 2836.42] because a sad face is good for the heart.
[2837.48 → 2840.54] The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning,
[2840.94 → 2844.52] but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure.
[2845.90 → 2849.20] It is better to heed the rebuke of a wise person
[2849.20 → 2851.70] than to listen to the song of fools.
[2852.94 → 2855.90] Like the crackling of thorns under the pot,
[2856.14 → 2858.22] so is the laughter of fools.
[2858.22 → 2861.62] This, too, is meaningless.
[2864.08 → 2867.10] Extortion turns a wise person into a fool,
[2867.36 → 2869.62] and a bribe corrupts the heart.
[2871.52 → 2874.04] The end of the matter is better than its beginning,
[2874.34 → 2876.14] and patience is better than pride.
[2876.56 → 2879.06] Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit,
[2879.22 → 2882.06] for anger resides in the lap of fools.
[2883.76 → 2885.06] Do not say,
[2885.06 → 2888.78] Why were the old days better than these days?
[2889.46 → 2892.16] For it is not wise to ask such questions.
[2894.34 → 2897.38] Wisdom, like inheritance, is a good thing,
[2897.52 → 2899.70] and benefits those who see the sun.
[2900.80 → 2903.46] Wisdom is a shelter, as money is a shelter,
[2903.74 → 2905.98] but the advantage of knowledge is this,
[2906.44 → 2908.92] wisdom preserves those who have it.
[2908.92 → 2911.90] Consider what God has done.
[2912.44 → 2915.30] Who can straighten what he has made crooked?
[2916.24 → 2918.48] When times are good, be happy,
[2918.92 → 2921.88] but when times are bad, consider this.
[2923.24 → 2926.98] God has made the one as well as the other.
[2926.98 → 2931.76] Therefore, no one can discover anything about their future.
[2933.30 → 2935.76] In this meaningless life of mine,
[2935.84 → 2937.70] I have seen both of these,
[2938.02 → 2940.52] the righteous perishing in their righteousness,
[2940.76 → 2943.16] and the wicked living long in their wickedness.
[2944.36 → 2946.34] Do not be over-righteous,
[2946.46 → 2948.16] neither be over-wise.
[2948.36 → 2949.82] Why destroy yourself?
[2951.02 → 2952.66] Do not be over-wicked,
[2952.88 → 2954.12] and do not be a fool.
[2954.12 → 2956.12] Why die before your time?
[2958.06 → 2959.76] It is good to grasp the one,
[2959.96 → 2961.58] and not let go of the other.
[2963.04 → 2966.84] Whoever fears God will avoid all extremes.
[2968.94 → 2971.64] Wisdom makes one person more powerful
[2971.64 → 2973.38] than ten rulers in a city.
[2974.60 → 2977.16] Indeed, there is no one on earth who is righteous,
[2977.40 → 2978.78] no one who does what is right,
[2978.82 → 2979.64] and never sins.
[2980.30 → 2983.00] Do not pay attention to every word people say,
[2983.00 → 2985.64] or you may hear your servant cursing you,
[2986.18 → 2987.62] for you know in your heart
[2987.62 → 2991.12] that many times you yourself have cursed others.
[2992.98 → 2995.66] All this I tested by wisdom,
[2995.92 → 2996.72] and I said,
[2997.56 → 3000.18] I am determined to be wise,
[3000.94 → 3003.42] but this was beyond me.
[3004.46 → 3006.22] Whatever exists is far off,
[3006.28 → 3007.38] and most profound,
[3007.48 → 3008.54] who can discover it?
[3008.54 → 3011.98] So I turned my mind to understand,
[3012.32 → 3013.00] to investigate,
[3013.26 → 3014.34] and to search out wisdom,
[3014.58 → 3015.78] and the scheme of things,
[3016.04 → 3019.06] and to understand the stupidity of wickedness,
[3019.18 → 3021.56] and the madness of folly.
[3022.76 → 3024.04] This is the word of the Lord.
[3024.04 → 3033.84] Now, if Ecclesiastes has already been a strange book,
[3034.26 → 3036.18] this gets a little bit more strange.
[3037.66 → 3039.04] And in fact, it becomes,
[3039.44 → 3040.96] this chapter especially,
[3042.22 → 3045.58] you start to see why people have thought
[3045.58 → 3047.76] that maybe it was written by Solomon,
[3047.96 → 3051.28] because this reads much more like the book of Proverbs
[3051.28 → 3053.52] than some of the other parts of Ecclesiastes
[3053.52 → 3055.36] that we have read.
[3056.36 → 3059.10] And so I just want to manage your expectations
[3059.10 → 3059.96] at the outset.
[3060.70 → 3062.22] Every verse we read in there,
[3062.30 → 3064.88] I am not going to have time to reflect on.
[3065.40 → 3067.68] And so I trust there are going to be follow-up questions
[3067.68 → 3068.40] that you have,
[3068.42 → 3068.72] or like,
[3068.88 → 3069.70] what about this?
[3069.80 → 3070.66] Or what about this?
[3070.92 → 3073.36] I really encourage you to dig into those,
[3073.46 → 3074.82] talk to your friends and families,
[3074.94 → 3075.60] your care groups,
[3076.00 → 3077.26] wrestle with those things.
[3077.26 → 3081.36] But I have, I think,
[3081.46 → 3084.12] discerned for us a through line.
[3084.98 → 3086.06] To help get at that,
[3086.64 → 3088.54] I want to draw your attention actually
[3088.54 → 3091.06] to a song that I discovered,
[3091.72 → 3093.16] and maybe rediscovered,
[3093.18 → 3094.96] but it's a really, ancient song.
[3095.44 → 3096.72] So I don't know actually
[3096.72 → 3098.34] if it was one that I knew beforehand,
[3098.86 → 3102.82] because it comes long before the time that I was alive.
[3102.88 → 3104.62] It's a song from the 1970s.
[3104.62 → 3107.94] And that's ancient for most of us.
[3109.84 → 3111.42] It's a song by Neil Young.
[3112.84 → 3114.22] And the song is called
[3114.22 → 3115.60] Don't Let It Bring You Down.
[3117.22 → 3119.86] And Neil Young opens that song
[3119.86 → 3121.24] with the line,
[3121.90 → 3124.36] old man lying by the side of the road
[3124.36 → 3126.60] with the lorries rolling by.
[3127.84 → 3129.24] And then he continues later in that verse,
[3129.42 → 3131.92] dead man lying by the side of the road
[3131.92 → 3134.74] with the daylight in his eyes.
[3136.14 → 3138.10] And verse 2 goes on,
[3138.64 → 3141.58] blind man running through the light of the night
[3141.58 → 3143.96] with an answer in his hand,
[3145.36 → 3148.48] white cane lying in the gutter in the lane,
[3149.14 → 3151.44] if you're walking home alone.
[3153.22 → 3154.96] Now, Neil Young's lyrics,
[3155.46 → 3157.06] capture, I think,
[3157.06 → 3160.94] in a way that only sort of protest music can.
[3160.94 → 3165.02] The weary compassion of one
[3165.02 → 3168.62] who sees the world's injustice and decay,
[3169.16 → 3171.66] but feels powerless before it.
[3172.98 → 3175.62] In fact, at a live show that he did
[3175.62 → 3179.56] with Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young,
[3180.00 → 3183.58] he introduced this song to the crowd by saying,
[3183.94 → 3186.52] and now for something that will surely depress you.
[3187.06 → 3188.88] And then they went into this song.
[3190.22 → 3192.32] But beneath this song,
[3193.08 → 3195.02] there's a sense, if you know it,
[3195.46 → 3198.26] a sense of comfort
[3198.26 → 3203.32] that comes by a shared experience of futility.
[3204.46 → 3206.38] The idea there is that if we all feel it,
[3206.44 → 3207.60] at least we're not alone.
[3207.80 → 3210.50] And the chorus holds this resignation.
[3211.12 → 3211.84] You see it there.
[3212.18 → 3212.46] It says,
[3212.80 → 3214.44] don't let it bring you down.
[3214.60 → 3216.38] It's only castles burning.
[3216.38 → 3218.08] And then there's this faint hope.
[3218.54 → 3220.22] Find someone who's turning,
[3220.60 → 3221.90] and you will come around.
[3223.60 → 3224.90] Poets and songwriters,
[3225.06 → 3226.30] like I've said before,
[3226.66 → 3230.16] often name the ache of a generation.
[3230.98 → 3232.06] Poets and songwriters
[3232.06 → 3234.70] capture something of the ethos
[3234.70 → 3237.22] of a cultural moment and a perspective.
[3237.22 → 3242.10] And I think what Young is capturing for us here
[3242.10 → 3245.24] is this hard message of life
[3245.24 → 3248.04] that so many people in the world today
[3248.04 → 3249.80] that feel and know,
[3250.02 → 3253.78] but refuse to heed in the lived reality
[3253.78 → 3255.24] of our everyday experience.
[3256.06 → 3257.38] This is the same message
[3257.38 → 3259.18] that the teacher in Ecclesiastes
[3259.18 → 3262.68] is trying to convey over and over and over again.
[3263.36 → 3264.32] It's one message,
[3264.44 → 3266.54] but it's perhaps best conveyed in two parts.
[3266.64 → 3267.78] And so I'll start with the two parts.
[3268.04 → 3268.30] One,
[3268.92 → 3270.48] we are not in control.
[3272.24 → 3273.54] The second part to that is
[3273.54 → 3275.64] we can't explain everything.
[3279.22 → 3280.30] People you love
[3280.30 → 3282.10] get sick and die.
[3283.26 → 3284.22] We don't know why.
[3286.36 → 3287.52] You might lose your job,
[3287.52 → 3290.40] and you have no understanding
[3290.40 → 3291.62] why that comes.
[3293.82 → 3295.94] Your marriage might be falling apart,
[3296.80 → 3298.38] and you cry out,
[3298.64 → 3300.46] God, why would you let this happen to me?
[3302.48 → 3304.40] Looking at our own lives,
[3304.50 → 3305.62] at the stories we hear,
[3305.74 → 3307.76] looking at the world around us
[3307.76 → 3309.68] and stories from around the globe,
[3309.98 → 3311.62] as well as from our own backyard,
[3312.02 → 3313.60] injustice and oppression
[3313.60 → 3314.68] are everywhere.
[3314.68 → 3317.52] And for some of us,
[3317.76 → 3319.60] we live in this perpetuity
[3319.60 → 3321.30] of darkness in our minds
[3321.30 → 3322.72] that becomes oppressive.
[3323.24 → 3325.10] And for some more of us,
[3325.18 → 3327.48] there's this longing in our hearts,
[3327.84 → 3329.24] this hurt or ache
[3329.24 → 3331.24] in the core of our souls
[3331.24 → 3333.04] that just doesn't go away.
[3335.52 → 3336.66] This is the blind man
[3336.66 → 3338.70] with the answer in his hand,
[3338.96 → 3341.18] only to find the sirens
[3341.18 → 3342.86] and the white cane
[3342.86 → 3344.70] lying in the gutter of the lane.
[3346.14 → 3347.78] The answer that was clung to
[3347.78 → 3350.04] is robbed by death
[3350.04 → 3350.88] in an alley.
[3352.80 → 3356.12] And this is what we are seeing,
[3356.26 → 3356.46] right?
[3356.50 → 3357.94] And in this life
[3357.94 → 3359.42] where we're not in control
[3359.42 → 3360.88] and we can't explain everything,
[3361.14 → 3363.30] we still live with this impulse
[3363.30 → 3365.38] to master life,
[3365.78 → 3366.12] right?
[3366.16 → 3367.60] Through reason or productivity
[3367.60 → 3369.70] or therapy or technology,
[3369.70 → 3370.80] and yet,
[3370.92 → 3372.26] over and over and over again,
[3372.48 → 3374.12] life resists our control
[3374.12 → 3375.96] and it defies our comprehension.
[3377.80 → 3380.56] And in the face of this reality,
[3381.22 → 3383.96] there's really only two options for us.
[3385.24 → 3387.88] We can run from the reality of it all.
[3388.00 → 3389.36] We can numb the pain
[3389.36 → 3390.64] through different ways.
[3390.74 → 3392.14] We can ignore the problems.
[3392.50 → 3393.12] We can party.
[3393.30 → 3393.94] We can escape.
[3393.94 → 3395.16] We can laugh as loud
[3395.16 → 3395.84] and as often
[3395.84 → 3398.58] as we can possibly figure out to do
[3398.58 → 3399.64] in order to cover up
[3399.64 → 3401.48] the silence of our emptiness.
[3402.56 → 3404.32] We can live in the past
[3404.32 → 3406.72] or we can live in our imaginations.
[3407.88 → 3410.76] Sure, we can curate our own escape.
[3412.44 → 3413.82] We can try to define
[3413.82 → 3416.12] our own alternate reality.
[3417.20 → 3418.90] Or, the second option,
[3419.46 → 3421.10] and what Ecclesiastes 7,
[3421.10 → 3422.30] I want to suggest,
[3422.60 → 3423.94] puts on offer for us
[3423.94 → 3425.04] as a better alternative
[3425.04 → 3427.58] is the way of wisdom.
[3429.20 → 3429.68] But,
[3430.16 → 3432.22] even wisdom here
[3432.22 → 3434.74] isn't exactly what you expect it to be.
[3436.20 → 3436.56] Right?
[3436.60 → 3438.04] The wisdom of the Bible,
[3438.18 → 3439.38] the wisdom of the teacher
[3439.38 → 3440.34] will tell you that
[3440.34 → 3442.24] even being wise
[3442.24 → 3443.82] won't give you everything.
[3445.40 → 3445.92] Right?
[3446.00 → 3447.54] Even wisdom isn't enough.
[3447.66 → 3448.22] It's better,
[3448.66 → 3448.96] yes,
[3449.08 → 3449.44] and amen,
[3449.64 → 3450.44] but it's not enough.
[3451.46 → 3452.20] Wisdom, then,
[3452.32 → 3455.10] begins when we accept that truth,
[3455.18 → 3456.80] when we lay down the illusion
[3456.80 → 3458.98] that life is a puzzle to be solved
[3458.98 → 3460.32] or a system to be mastered,
[3460.52 → 3461.20] and instead,
[3461.66 → 3462.98] when we learn to live
[3462.98 → 3463.84] as creatures
[3463.84 → 3465.68] before our Creator.
[3468.18 → 3470.42] Life resists our control
[3470.42 → 3472.68] and defies our comprehension.
[3474.26 → 3475.92] And once the illusions of mastery
[3475.92 → 3476.68] fall away,
[3476.88 → 3477.86] what's left?
[3478.70 → 3480.26] What kind of life can you build
[3480.26 → 3482.00] when you no longer believe
[3482.00 → 3484.36] and realize that you're in charge?
[3485.96 → 3487.66] That's where the teacher's taking us.
[3489.20 → 3491.40] Ecclesiastes 7 opens with
[3491.40 → 3493.06] the way of wisdom,
[3493.06 → 3495.78] not as an escape from life's enigmas,
[3495.90 → 3497.88] but as a way to walk through them.
[3498.88 → 3500.06] And the teacher, then,
[3500.10 → 3502.04] is beginning to retrain,
[3502.26 → 3504.28] to re-educate our minds,
[3504.28 → 3507.06] to train us how to think rightly
[3507.06 → 3508.46] about what is real.
[3509.86 → 3510.28] And again,
[3510.38 → 3510.68] wisdom,
[3510.90 → 3512.30] in this view here,
[3512.36 → 3513.22] isn't sentimental
[3513.22 → 3514.64] or self-assured.
[3515.14 → 3517.54] It's actually sobered by death.
[3517.68 → 3519.46] It's chastened by suffering,
[3519.46 → 3521.08] and it's rooted in faith
[3521.08 → 3522.42] that God's providence
[3522.42 → 3523.80] rules over all things,
[3523.98 → 3524.88] whether the straight
[3524.88 → 3525.72] or the crooked.
[3527.02 → 3528.18] And that's where we'll start.
[3528.18 → 3528.80] In verse 2,
[3529.36 → 3530.30] the teacher says
[3530.30 → 3531.48] that death
[3531.48 → 3532.98] is the destiny
[3532.98 → 3534.58] of everyone.
[3535.56 → 3536.08] The living
[3536.08 → 3537.28] should take this
[3537.28 → 3538.34] to heart.
[3539.60 → 3540.00] Living
[3540.00 → 3541.86] with the end in view
[3541.86 → 3542.96] or with the reality
[3542.96 → 3543.64] of death
[3543.64 → 3544.58] on our minds
[3544.58 → 3545.96] changes how we see
[3545.96 → 3546.44] the present.
[3547.52 → 3548.40] And from the very beginning
[3548.40 → 3549.18] of this series,
[3549.18 → 3550.54] we have been naming this.
[3550.62 → 3551.58] We've heard the teacher
[3551.58 → 3554.08] wrestle with life
[3554.08 → 3555.10] under the sun,
[3555.48 → 3555.88] asking,
[3556.08 → 3556.86] what does it all matter?
[3556.86 → 3557.92] Right?
[3557.94 → 3558.60] We're all going to die.
[3559.98 → 3560.88] That isn't cynicism
[3560.88 → 3561.56] for the teacher.
[3562.12 → 3562.82] That's clarity.
[3564.48 → 3565.34] And death has a way
[3565.34 → 3566.36] of stripping away
[3566.36 → 3568.28] the illusions of life
[3568.28 → 3569.26] and teaching us,
[3569.62 → 3570.60] exposing for us
[3570.60 → 3572.24] what really matters.
[3574.00 → 3574.64] And wisdom
[3574.64 → 3578.30] begins with that awareness.
[3580.18 → 3581.20] The foolish heart
[3581.20 → 3582.66] avoids thoughts of death.
[3582.78 → 3583.72] The wise heart
[3583.72 → 3584.62] faces them.
[3585.06 → 3586.06] The wise person
[3586.06 → 3586.96] goes to the house
[3586.96 → 3587.72] of despair
[3587.72 → 3589.26] and to the house
[3589.26 → 3589.68] of mourning
[3589.68 → 3590.66] not in despair
[3590.66 → 3592.30] but to remember.
[3593.42 → 3593.56] Right?
[3593.60 → 3594.52] To measure life
[3594.52 → 3595.86] by its true scale.
[3596.24 → 3597.28] To live each day
[3597.28 → 3598.08] as a gift
[3598.08 → 3599.14] that comes to us
[3599.14 → 3600.02] from the hand of God.
[3601.72 → 3602.50] And the teacher
[3602.50 → 3603.04] goes on
[3603.04 → 3604.10] building this idea.
[3604.86 → 3605.24] He says,
[3606.72 → 3607.22] it is
[3607.22 → 3608.54] better
[3608.54 → 3609.68] in verse 5
[3609.68 → 3610.30] to heed
[3610.30 → 3611.02] the rebuke
[3611.02 → 3612.28] of a wise person
[3612.28 → 3613.72] than to listen
[3613.72 → 3614.68] to the song
[3614.68 → 3615.48] of fools.
[3617.70 → 3619.26] Proverbs 27
[3619.26 → 3620.18] verse 6
[3620.18 → 3620.92] says,
[3621.64 → 3623.00] faithful are the wounds
[3623.00 → 3624.28] of a friend.
[3626.60 → 3627.60] Those are the kinds
[3627.60 → 3628.24] of wounds
[3628.24 → 3629.66] that heal.
[3631.56 → 3632.90] A few years ago,
[3633.78 → 3635.68] Corey Asbury
[3635.68 → 3636.68] wrote a song
[3636.68 → 3637.34] called
[3637.34 → 3638.86] Faithful Wounds.
[3639.36 → 3640.44] It's one of his
[3640.44 → 3641.86] lesser known songs
[3641.86 → 3642.62] and so I'm not surprised
[3642.62 → 3643.70] if you haven't heard it.
[3644.28 → 3645.36] But in this song
[3645.36 → 3646.50] he says,
[3646.94 → 3647.34] God,
[3647.44 → 3648.26] I'm wrestling
[3648.26 → 3649.76] with the wounds
[3649.76 → 3650.28] again.
[3651.20 → 3652.16] My impatience,
[3652.28 → 3652.82] a disease
[3652.82 → 3653.96] in this cage
[3653.96 → 3655.02] of mice and men.
[3655.34 → 3656.34] My head knows
[3656.34 → 3657.32] to trust you
[3657.32 → 3658.88] but the heart
[3658.88 → 3659.38] of me
[3659.38 → 3660.34] is slain.
[3661.76 → 3662.52] And he asks,
[3662.62 → 3662.78] God,
[3663.04 → 3663.80] these questions
[3663.80 → 3664.46] won't just,
[3664.94 → 3665.98] these questions
[3665.98 → 3666.94] that just won't
[3666.94 → 3667.80] leave me alone.
[3668.26 → 3669.10] Will this crushing
[3669.10 → 3670.12] ever end
[3670.12 → 3671.58] or is this ache
[3671.58 → 3672.98] now my home?
[3674.48 → 3675.72] And then in the chorus
[3675.72 → 3677.62] he turns
[3677.62 → 3678.82] to hope.
[3679.60 → 3680.56] But a realistic
[3680.56 → 3681.46] hope.
[3681.60 → 3681.88] He says,
[3682.28 → 3683.18] faithful are the wounds
[3683.18 → 3683.86] of a friend.
[3684.46 → 3685.78] Faithful are the dealings
[3685.78 → 3686.80] of your hand.
[3687.20 → 3687.76] The troubles
[3687.76 → 3688.76] and the trials
[3688.76 → 3689.88] like the gold
[3689.88 → 3690.98] refining fire.
[3691.66 → 3692.20] Faithful
[3692.20 → 3693.40] are the wounds
[3693.40 → 3694.66] of a friend.
[3696.78 → 3698.06] That's the voice
[3698.06 → 3699.58] of Ecclesiastes 7
[3699.58 → 3701.52] and Proverbs 27.
[3702.92 → 3703.52] The teacher
[3703.52 → 3704.58] knows that
[3704.58 → 3705.40] the rebuke
[3705.40 → 3706.38] of the wise
[3706.38 → 3707.34] and the discipline
[3707.34 → 3708.46] of God
[3708.46 → 3709.42] are painful
[3709.42 → 3711.10] but they are
[3711.10 → 3712.26] purposeful.
[3714.00 → 3715.12] And this may be
[3715.12 → 3715.78] one of the hardest
[3715.78 → 3716.96] lessons that the teacher
[3716.96 → 3717.92] has for us
[3717.92 → 3718.84] in the book
[3718.84 → 3719.68] of Ecclesiastes.
[3720.50 → 3721.44] This may be
[3721.44 → 3722.00] one of the most
[3722.00 → 3722.86] difficult truths
[3722.86 → 3723.46] of God
[3723.46 → 3724.70] to wrap our minds
[3724.70 → 3725.16] around
[3725.16 → 3726.50] because in the end
[3726.50 → 3727.56] we actually can't.
[3727.72 → 3728.24] Not fully.
[3730.52 → 3731.08] C.S. Lewis
[3731.08 → 3732.68] once called
[3732.68 → 3733.86] this truth
[3733.86 → 3735.82] a severe
[3735.82 → 3736.70] mercy.
[3738.72 → 3739.76] After the death
[3739.76 → 3740.66] of his wife
[3740.66 → 3742.40] C.S. Lewis
[3742.40 → 3743.76] used that phrase
[3743.76 → 3745.06] severe mercy
[3745.06 → 3746.42] to describe
[3746.42 → 3747.84] for a friend
[3747.84 → 3748.86] in a letter
[3748.86 → 3750.32] how God
[3750.32 → 3750.96] can use
[3750.96 → 3752.52] even the sharpest
[3752.52 → 3753.06] pain
[3753.06 → 3755.00] as an instrument
[3755.00 → 3755.72] of grace.
[3756.50 → 3758.06] A severe mercy
[3758.06 → 3758.92] describes how
[3758.92 → 3759.60] God's love
[3759.60 → 3760.62] sometimes takes
[3760.62 → 3761.52] the form
[3761.52 → 3763.08] of painful providence
[3763.08 → 3764.20] that nonetheless
[3764.20 → 3765.60] leads to greater
[3765.60 → 3766.84] good and deeper
[3766.84 → 3767.66] faith.
[3769.28 → 3770.26] The reformer
[3770.26 → 3771.06] John Calvin
[3771.06 → 3772.96] in the 16th century
[3772.96 → 3774.06] called these
[3774.06 → 3775.26] experiences
[3775.26 → 3776.26] fatherly
[3776.26 → 3777.18] chastisements.
[3778.18 → 3778.74] He wrote
[3778.74 → 3780.24] in his book
[3780.24 → 3781.14] Institutes of the
[3781.14 → 3781.72] Christian Religion
[3781.72 → 3782.14] he said
[3782.14 → 3783.08] the chastening
[3783.08 → 3783.74] of God
[3783.74 → 3784.34] carries
[3784.34 → 3785.08] his blessing
[3785.08 → 3785.74] with it
[3785.74 → 3786.64] and is
[3786.64 → 3787.56] an evidence
[3787.56 → 3788.84] of love.
[3790.06 → 3790.62] He goes on
[3790.62 → 3790.88] he says
[3790.88 → 3791.44] in the very
[3791.44 → 3791.88] bitterness
[3791.88 → 3792.94] of tribulation
[3792.94 → 3793.64] we ought to
[3793.64 → 3794.14] recognize
[3794.14 → 3794.86] the kindness
[3794.86 → 3796.00] and mercy
[3796.00 → 3797.26] of our father
[3797.26 → 3798.72] for he
[3798.72 → 3799.82] afflicts
[3799.82 → 3800.80] not that he
[3800.80 → 3801.58] may destroy
[3801.58 → 3803.52] but that he
[3803.52 → 3804.12] may deliver
[3804.12 → 3804.62] us.
[3807.50 → 3808.00] And in fact
[3808.00 → 3809.24] about a thousand
[3809.24 → 3810.34] years before
[3810.34 → 3811.08] Calvin said
[3811.08 → 3811.40] that
[3811.40 → 3812.40] St. Augustine
[3812.40 → 3813.36] said something
[3813.36 → 3814.04] very similar
[3814.04 → 3815.58] he said
[3815.58 → 3816.20] the suffering
[3816.20 → 3817.08] at which you
[3817.08 → 3817.80] cry is
[3817.80 → 3818.40] medicine
[3818.40 → 3819.72] not punishment
[3819.72 → 3821.54] chastisement
[3821.54 → 3823.30] not condemnation
[3823.30 → 3824.98] do not
[3824.98 → 3825.64] drive away
[3825.64 → 3826.32] the rod
[3826.32 → 3827.14] if you would
[3827.14 → 3827.56] not be
[3827.56 → 3829.38] driven away
[3829.38 → 3830.24] from the
[3830.24 → 3830.74] inheritance.
[3834.00 → 3834.86] Wisdom
[3834.86 → 3836.62] accepts
[3836.62 → 3838.08] that even
[3838.08 → 3838.86] painful
[3838.86 → 3839.68] rebuke
[3839.68 → 3840.78] is a form
[3840.78 → 3841.64] of divine
[3841.64 → 3842.78] friendship
[3842.78 → 3844.48] divine love.
[3845.54 → 3846.30] The fool
[3846.30 → 3846.96] resents
[3846.96 → 3847.64] correction
[3847.64 → 3848.98] the wise
[3848.98 → 3850.14] receives it
[3850.14 → 3851.54] as grace.
[3859.22 → 3860.12] You know
[3860.12 → 3860.66] the moment
[3860.66 → 3862.50] when the
[3862.50 → 3862.76] bottom
[3862.76 → 3863.32] falls out
[3863.32 → 3863.76] of something
[3863.76 → 3864.48] that you
[3864.48 → 3864.96] thought was
[3864.96 → 3865.36] secure
[3865.36 → 3867.60] maybe you
[3867.60 → 3867.80] get a
[3867.80 → 3868.28] diagnosis
[3868.28 → 3870.78] maybe you
[3870.78 → 3871.86] lose
[3871.86 → 3874.02] your tenure
[3874.02 → 3874.58] track
[3874.58 → 3875.32] position
[3875.32 → 3876.40] maybe it's
[3876.40 → 3876.96] a friendship
[3876.96 → 3877.70] that suddenly
[3877.70 → 3878.52] changes
[3878.52 → 3879.06] or a
[3879.06 → 3879.56] relationship
[3879.56 → 3881.08] that ends
[3881.08 → 3881.46] what you
[3881.46 → 3882.12] thought was
[3882.12 → 3882.58] sure
[3882.58 → 3883.24] and
[3883.24 → 3884.38] insured
[3884.38 → 3884.94] suddenly
[3884.94 → 3885.94] is gone
[3885.94 → 3887.98] and so you
[3887.98 → 3888.30] pray
[3888.30 → 3889.02] because you're
[3889.02 → 3889.22] a good
[3889.22 → 3889.58] Christian
[3889.58 → 3890.28] and you know
[3890.28 → 3890.60] that that's
[3890.60 → 3890.82] what you're
[3890.82 → 3891.26] supposed to
[3891.26 → 3891.46] do
[3891.46 → 3891.98] and you
[3891.98 → 3892.48] search for
[3892.48 → 3892.82] answers
[3892.82 → 3893.38] you search
[3893.38 → 3893.96] the scriptures
[3893.96 → 3894.86] day in
[3894.86 → 3895.42] and day out
[3895.42 → 3896.62] and all
[3896.62 → 3897.40] you hear
[3897.40 → 3898.80] is silence.
[3901.02 → 3902.10] We start
[3902.10 → 3902.64] to wonder
[3902.64 → 3903.58] if God's
[3903.58 → 3904.10] love
[3904.10 → 3905.88] and God's
[3905.88 → 3906.40] discipline
[3906.40 → 3908.14] can really
[3908.14 → 3908.86] occupy the
[3908.86 → 3909.50] same space.
[3911.72 → 3912.72] We start
[3912.72 → 3913.08] to wonder
[3913.08 → 3913.62] how can
[3913.62 → 3914.06] this
[3914.06 → 3914.86] impossible
[3914.86 → 3916.18] reality
[3916.18 → 3917.58] have a
[3917.58 → 3918.06] purpose?
[3918.06 → 3921.20] that's
[3921.20 → 3921.36] the
[3921.36 → 3921.78] tension
[3921.78 → 3923.78] of God's
[3923.78 → 3924.04] severe
[3924.04 → 3924.58] mercies.
[3925.28 → 3925.56] That's
[3925.56 → 3926.02] the tension
[3926.02 → 3926.38] that the
[3926.38 → 3926.90] teacher is
[3926.90 → 3927.46] inviting us
[3927.46 → 3928.18] to live
[3928.18 → 3928.36] in.
[3928.42 → 3928.78] He says
[3928.78 → 3929.66] that sometimes
[3929.66 → 3930.78] what feels
[3930.78 → 3931.72] like absence
[3931.72 → 3933.00] is actually
[3933.00 → 3933.92] refinement.
[3934.16 → 3934.80] What feels
[3934.80 → 3935.78] like rejection
[3935.78 → 3937.08] is the hand
[3937.08 → 3937.74] of a faithful
[3937.74 → 3938.36] friend.
[3938.48 → 3939.14] What feels
[3939.14 → 3939.94] like judgment
[3939.94 → 3941.10] is actually
[3941.10 → 3941.86] drawing you
[3941.86 → 3942.86] closer to
[3942.86 → 3943.18] the heart
[3943.18 → 3943.62] of God.
[3945.08 → 3945.34] And so
[3945.34 → 3946.08] maybe what
[3946.08 → 3946.54] we're learning
[3946.54 → 3947.46] here is that
[3947.46 → 3947.94] part of
[3947.94 → 3948.72] wisdom is
[3948.72 → 3949.34] to pray
[3949.34 → 3950.28] not only
[3950.28 → 3951.26] Lord take
[3951.26 → 3951.82] this away
[3951.82 → 3952.40] from me
[3952.40 → 3953.14] but also
[3953.14 → 3953.74] learning how
[3953.74 → 3954.16] to pray
[3954.16 → 3955.62] Lord don't
[3955.62 → 3956.36] waste this
[3956.36 → 3956.84] pain.
[3958.66 → 3959.72] Don't waste
[3959.72 → 3960.74] this heartbreak.
[3961.42 → 3962.14] Don't waste
[3962.14 → 3963.58] this brokenness.
[3965.22 → 3966.12] Faith doesn't
[3966.12 → 3966.84] always mean
[3966.84 → 3967.68] understanding
[3967.68 → 3968.44] the wound
[3968.44 → 3971.34] but it does
[3971.34 → 3972.74] mean trusting
[3972.74 → 3973.44] that even
[3973.44 → 3974.24] this wound
[3974.24 → 3976.06] is held
[3976.06 → 3977.40] in love
[3977.40 → 3979.00] from God.
[3981.56 → 3982.26] I said
[3982.26 → 3982.56] this was
[3982.56 → 3982.82] hard.
[3987.54 → 3988.12] And I
[3988.12 → 3988.64] know the
[3988.64 → 3989.06] wounds
[3989.06 → 3990.34] and the
[3990.34 → 3990.84] wounding
[3990.84 → 3992.12] that some
[3992.12 → 3992.34] of you
[3992.34 → 3992.70] carry.
[3996.60 → 3997.18] And I
[3997.18 → 3997.62] know that I
[3997.62 → 3998.08] don't know
[3998.08 → 3998.60] the wounds
[3998.60 → 3999.02] and the
[3999.02 → 3999.52] woundings
[3999.52 → 4000.84] that some
[4000.84 → 4001.08] of you
[4001.08 → 4001.42] have held
[4001.42 → 4001.88] on to
[4001.88 → 4003.02] quietly
[4003.02 → 4003.52] and by
[4003.52 → 4003.98] yourself.
[4003.98 → 4004.04] love.
[4005.92 → 4006.68] This is
[4006.68 → 4007.04] hard.
[4009.72 → 4010.46] But with
[4010.46 → 4010.78] as much
[4010.78 → 4011.58] love as I
[4011.58 → 4012.10] can muster
[4012.10 → 4012.70] from a
[4012.70 → 4013.64] platform in
[4013.64 → 4013.98] front of
[4013.98 → 4014.20] you,
[4015.32 → 4016.56] can I
[4016.56 → 4018.42] say that
[4018.42 → 4018.74] it would be
[4018.74 → 4019.16] harder
[4019.16 → 4020.58] without God?
[4021.92 → 4022.86] It would be
[4022.86 → 4024.00] harder without
[4024.00 → 4025.00] this truth
[4025.00 → 4025.88] and purpose.
[4026.64 → 4026.86] Right?
[4026.86 → 4027.16] it would be
[4027.16 → 4027.94] harder if
[4027.94 → 4029.04] God actually
[4029.04 → 4029.86] had no
[4029.86 → 4030.48] purpose or
[4030.48 → 4031.12] no control
[4031.12 → 4032.32] or that it
[4032.32 → 4033.04] didn't make
[4033.04 → 4033.64] sense in
[4033.64 → 4034.24] his great
[4034.24 → 4034.60] plan.
[4034.84 → 4035.80] Like that's
[4035.80 → 4036.74] truly
[4036.74 → 4038.18] existentially
[4038.18 → 4039.18] shattering.
[4039.18 → 4039.30] suffering.
[4046.16 → 4046.70] But in
[4046.70 → 4047.38] this moment,
[4048.22 → 4049.38] what is
[4049.38 → 4049.80] God calling
[4049.80 → 4050.04] you to
[4050.04 → 4050.26] pray?
[4052.14 → 4052.66] How is
[4052.66 → 4053.02] God calling
[4053.02 → 4053.26] you to
[4053.26 → 4053.70] see him,
[4054.48 → 4055.20] to trust
[4055.20 → 4055.54] in him?
[4058.02 → 4058.60] And there's
[4058.60 → 4058.96] a temptation
[4058.96 → 4059.56] here and the
[4059.56 → 4060.16] teacher warns
[4060.16 → 4060.42] us.
[4061.34 → 4062.04] He says in
[4062.04 → 4062.54] verse 10,
[4063.58 → 4064.14] do not
[4064.14 → 4064.54] say,
[4065.14 → 4065.50] why were
[4065.50 → 4065.96] the old
[4065.96 → 4066.56] days better
[4066.56 → 4067.06] than these?
[4067.84 → 4068.14] For it's
[4068.14 → 4068.82] not wise to
[4068.82 → 4069.16] ask so
[4069.16 → 4070.28] such questions.
[4071.14 → 4071.34] Right?
[4071.38 → 4072.00] In the depths
[4072.00 → 4072.26] of our
[4072.26 → 4072.88] brokenness and
[4072.88 → 4073.24] pain,
[4073.42 → 4073.92] it's really
[4073.92 → 4074.38] easy to
[4074.38 → 4074.84] look back
[4074.84 → 4075.50] and remember
[4075.50 → 4075.94] a time
[4075.94 → 4076.74] before this.
[4077.52 → 4077.68] Say,
[4077.76 → 4077.88] oh,
[4077.92 → 4078.26] if we could
[4078.26 → 4078.54] just go
[4078.54 → 4079.00] back there.
[4080.58 → 4080.72] Right?
[4080.76 → 4081.22] And here,
[4081.40 → 4081.94] I think the
[4081.94 → 4082.50] teacher is
[4082.50 → 4083.30] warning us
[4083.30 → 4083.92] against
[4083.92 → 4085.38] nostalgia
[4085.38 → 4086.98] as spiritual
[4086.98 → 4087.82] escapism.
[4089.22 → 4089.72] Right?
[4089.82 → 4090.26] Because what
[4090.26 → 4090.70] we're seeing
[4090.70 → 4091.00] is that
[4091.00 → 4092.32] nostalgia is
[4092.32 → 4093.26] often a
[4093.26 → 4094.20] longing for
[4094.20 → 4094.92] a past
[4094.92 → 4095.50] that never
[4095.50 → 4096.44] really existed.
[4097.72 → 4098.46] And in
[4098.46 → 4098.80] longing for a
[4098.80 → 4099.64] past that
[4099.64 → 4100.14] never really
[4100.14 → 4100.64] existed,
[4101.16 → 4101.44] what is
[4101.44 → 4101.96] actually,
[4102.22 → 4102.78] and underneath
[4102.78 → 4103.28] it all,
[4103.36 → 4103.64] I want to
[4103.64 → 4104.18] suggest to
[4104.18 → 4104.44] you,
[4104.72 → 4105.64] is a sort
[4105.64 → 4106.90] of veiled
[4106.90 → 4107.64] or hidden
[4107.64 → 4109.34] protest against
[4109.34 → 4110.32] God's providence
[4110.32 → 4111.18] in the present
[4111.18 → 4113.22] for right now.
[4114.22 → 4114.38] Right?
[4114.40 → 4114.70] Here's the
[4114.70 → 4114.94] danger.
[4115.06 → 4115.34] When we
[4115.34 → 4116.24] idealize the
[4116.24 → 4116.68] good old
[4116.68 → 4117.10] days,
[4117.28 → 4118.32] we are quietly
[4118.32 → 4119.34] accusing God
[4119.34 → 4120.22] of mishandling
[4120.22 → 4120.92] time in the
[4120.92 → 4121.32] present.
[4121.32 → 4121.40] moment.
[4123.48 → 4123.74] And the
[4123.74 → 4124.60] teacher knows
[4124.60 → 4125.06] the human
[4125.06 → 4125.50] heart's
[4125.50 → 4125.96] temptation
[4125.96 → 4126.82] for nostalgia
[4126.82 → 4127.86] to believe
[4127.86 → 4128.18] that there
[4128.18 → 4128.86] once was
[4128.86 → 4129.38] a golden
[4129.38 → 4129.96] age when
[4129.96 → 4130.46] life was
[4130.46 → 4131.34] simpler and
[4131.34 → 4132.02] purer and
[4132.02 → 4132.34] better,
[4132.58 → 4133.32] and in this
[4133.32 → 4133.92] nostalgia,
[4134.30 → 4134.74] we can be
[4134.74 → 4135.36] shaping a
[4135.36 → 4135.98] new form of
[4135.98 → 4136.66] escapism,
[4136.94 → 4137.38] a way of
[4137.38 → 4138.14] avoiding the
[4138.14 → 4138.96] present moment
[4138.96 → 4139.46] that God
[4139.46 → 4139.98] has actually
[4139.98 → 4140.66] put us in.
[4142.62 → 4143.14] Wisdom,
[4143.42 → 4143.76] then,
[4144.84 → 4146.02] remembers that
[4146.02 → 4146.82] the past
[4146.82 → 4148.08] was not as
[4148.08 → 4148.82] pure as
[4148.82 → 4150.04] we imagine
[4150.04 → 4150.88] it to have
[4150.88 → 4151.10] been.
[4152.40 → 4153.26] Every generation
[4153.26 → 4154.82] has its share
[4154.82 → 4155.96] of sin and
[4155.96 → 4156.66] sorrow, but
[4156.66 → 4158.78] nostalgia turns
[4158.78 → 4160.28] selective memory
[4160.28 → 4161.66] into an idol.
[4162.96 → 4163.72] And it tells us
[4163.72 → 4164.52] that what's broken
[4164.52 → 4165.20] in the world
[4165.20 → 4166.08] could be fixed
[4166.08 → 4167.20] if we only
[4167.20 → 4167.92] turned back
[4167.92 → 4168.52] the clock.
[4170.14 → 4171.38] And sometimes
[4171.38 → 4172.76] that nostalgia
[4172.76 → 4174.08] can become
[4174.08 → 4174.76] dangerous.
[4176.32 → 4177.22] When people
[4177.22 → 4178.10] long to return
[4178.10 → 4178.72] to a way
[4178.72 → 4179.50] things used
[4179.50 → 4180.06] to be,
[4180.42 → 4181.16] it carries
[4181.16 → 4181.84] with it
[4181.84 → 4182.84] undertones
[4182.84 → 4183.76] of exclusion,
[4184.82 → 4185.60] a desire
[4185.60 → 4186.86] for how
[4186.86 → 4187.42] the world
[4187.42 → 4188.48] once was
[4188.48 → 4189.56] for me.
[4191.30 → 4191.86] Everyone
[4191.86 → 4192.26] else be
[4192.26 → 4192.52] damned.
[4194.74 → 4195.50] I'm saying
[4195.50 → 4195.80] that as
[4195.80 → 4196.70] bluntly as
[4196.70 → 4197.12] I can.
[4198.14 → 4198.64] We see
[4198.64 → 4199.10] this in
[4199.10 → 4199.84] political
[4199.84 → 4200.48] movements
[4200.48 → 4200.86] and in
[4200.86 → 4201.26] cultural
[4201.26 → 4201.80] rhetoric
[4201.80 → 4202.88] that dresses
[4202.88 → 4203.66] up fear
[4203.66 → 4204.64] as a virtue
[4204.64 → 4205.46] that talks
[4205.46 → 4206.02] about making
[4206.02 → 4206.90] things great
[4206.90 → 4207.26] again,
[4207.26 → 4207.86] but really
[4207.86 → 4208.42] meaning
[4208.42 → 4209.14] making them
[4209.14 → 4209.70] mine
[4209.70 → 4210.14] again.
[4211.34 → 4212.18] That's not
[4212.18 → 4212.56] wisdom.
[4213.08 → 4213.42] That's
[4213.42 → 4214.18] self-deception.
[4215.42 → 4215.80] And a
[4215.80 → 4216.32] theological
[4216.32 → 4217.12] critique of
[4217.12 → 4217.58] nostalgia,
[4217.74 → 4218.04] which the
[4218.04 → 4218.46] teacher is
[4218.46 → 4218.96] inviting us
[4218.96 → 4219.10] to,
[4219.24 → 4220.26] can expose
[4220.26 → 4221.56] nostalgia as
[4221.56 → 4222.16] hidden forms
[4222.16 → 4222.80] of racism,
[4223.80 → 4224.60] as sexism,
[4225.38 → 4226.10] as xenophobia,
[4227.04 → 4227.70] as fear of the
[4227.70 → 4228.06] foreigner,
[4228.40 → 4229.66] inherent in
[4229.66 → 4230.44] these longings
[4230.44 → 4231.28] for the past
[4231.28 → 4232.22] because I want
[4232.22 → 4232.64] what was
[4232.64 → 4233.16] good for
[4233.16 → 4233.72] me.
[4235.76 → 4236.80] The teacher
[4236.80 → 4237.76] insists
[4237.76 → 4239.48] that wisdom
[4239.48 → 4241.56] looks forward
[4241.56 → 4242.76] in humble
[4242.76 → 4243.80] trust,
[4244.58 → 4245.38] not backwards
[4245.38 → 4245.90] in fear.
[4247.72 → 4248.30] God is not
[4248.30 → 4250.32] calling us
[4250.32 → 4250.98] to recover
[4250.98 → 4251.94] a mythical
[4251.94 → 4252.72] past,
[4253.38 → 4254.24] but to
[4254.24 → 4255.14] receive
[4255.14 → 4256.66] his presence
[4256.66 → 4257.44] in the
[4257.44 → 4257.82] present.
[4259.38 → 4260.24] The wisdom
[4260.24 → 4261.24] of contentment
[4261.24 → 4262.02] is learning
[4262.02 → 4262.52] to meet
[4262.52 → 4263.38] God here
[4263.38 → 4264.30] and now,
[4264.44 → 4264.98] in this
[4264.98 → 4265.28] moment,
[4265.40 → 4265.78] in this
[4265.78 → 4266.10] time,
[4266.28 → 4266.74] in this
[4266.74 → 4267.04] culture,
[4267.14 → 4267.56] with all
[4267.56 → 4267.82] of its
[4267.82 → 4268.40] complexities
[4268.40 → 4269.66] and nuances,
[4270.10 → 4271.00] believing that
[4271.00 → 4271.52] it was the
[4271.52 → 4272.26] same God
[4272.26 → 4272.66] who was
[4272.66 → 4273.60] faithful then,
[4273.72 → 4274.52] who will be
[4274.52 → 4275.48] faithful now,
[4275.52 → 4276.22] and who will
[4276.22 → 4276.86] be faithful
[4276.86 → 4278.02] in the future.
[4279.78 → 4280.10] And so
[4280.10 → 4280.42] really,
[4280.54 → 4280.94] the teacher
[4280.94 → 4281.52] is calling
[4281.52 → 4282.14] us to a
[4282.14 → 4283.04] different kind
[4283.04 → 4284.12] of realism.
[4285.40 → 4286.38] In verse 13
[4286.38 → 4287.34] and 14,
[4287.46 → 4287.94] he says,
[4288.64 → 4289.22] read with me,
[4289.28 → 4289.90] consider what
[4289.90 → 4290.66] God has done.
[4291.22 → 4291.72] Who can
[4291.72 → 4292.48] straighten what
[4292.48 → 4293.06] he has made
[4293.06 → 4293.40] crooked?
[4294.06 → 4294.64] When times
[4294.64 → 4294.98] are good,
[4295.06 → 4295.44] be happy,
[4295.54 → 4296.16] but when times
[4296.16 → 4296.64] are bad,
[4296.76 → 4297.44] consider this,
[4297.70 → 4298.50] God has made
[4298.50 → 4299.30] the one as
[4299.30 → 4299.96] well as
[4299.96 → 4300.78] the other.
[4302.36 → 4302.56] And so
[4302.56 → 4303.62] to consider
[4303.62 → 4304.92] is to view
[4304.92 → 4305.80] life through
[4305.80 → 4306.44] the lens
[4306.44 → 4307.06] of God's
[4307.06 → 4307.76] providence,
[4307.92 → 4308.82] that God
[4308.82 → 4309.70] is still
[4309.70 → 4310.56] yet active
[4310.56 → 4311.52] in this
[4311.52 → 4311.92] world.
[4311.92 → 4312.60] wisdom
[4312.60 → 4313.18] accepts
[4313.18 → 4314.00] both past
[4314.00 → 4314.72] and present,
[4314.86 → 4315.44] both joy
[4315.44 → 4316.10] and sorrow
[4316.10 → 4316.92] as coming
[4316.92 → 4317.48] from the
[4317.48 → 4318.60] same hand
[4318.60 → 4319.32] of the
[4319.32 → 4319.64] sovereign
[4319.64 → 4320.00] Lord.
[4321.04 → 4322.14] The fool
[4322.14 → 4323.02] looks back
[4323.02 → 4323.98] and complains.
[4325.14 → 4326.26] The wise
[4326.26 → 4327.12] look up
[4327.12 → 4328.44] and trust.
[4330.46 → 4330.76] And so
[4330.76 → 4331.20] in times
[4331.20 → 4331.84] of joy,
[4332.14 → 4332.56] rejoice.
[4333.84 → 4334.64] And in times
[4334.64 → 4335.22] of hardship,
[4335.84 → 4336.24] reflect.
[4337.20 → 4338.30] For both
[4338.30 → 4339.38] are gifts
[4339.38 → 4339.98] from the
[4339.98 → 4341.10] same God.
[4341.92 → 4343.00] the
[4343.00 → 4343.46] nostalgic
[4343.46 → 4344.06] heart
[4344.06 → 4344.94] resists
[4344.94 → 4345.70] that
[4345.70 → 4346.66] truth.
[4347.74 → 4348.78] The wise
[4348.78 → 4349.20] heart
[4349.20 → 4350.26] rests in
[4350.26 → 4350.42] it.
[4352.36 → 4353.14] Now this
[4353.14 → 4353.52] present
[4353.52 → 4354.00] moment
[4354.00 → 4355.48] may be
[4355.48 → 4356.46] a severe
[4356.46 → 4357.66] mercy.
[4358.66 → 4359.68] The kindness
[4359.68 → 4360.18] of God
[4360.18 → 4360.66] hidden in
[4360.66 → 4360.98] the crooked
[4360.98 → 4361.94] lines of
[4361.94 → 4362.46] our lives,
[4362.90 → 4364.32] but it is
[4364.32 → 4364.90] a mercy
[4364.90 → 4365.94] nonetheless.
[4365.94 → 4366.94] God
[4366.94 → 4367.94] bless.
[4367.94 → 4368.16] And so
[4368.16 → 4368.56] to that
[4368.56 → 4368.86] end,
[4368.92 → 4369.18] what I
[4369.18 → 4369.60] suggest
[4369.60 → 4370.06] to you
[4370.06 → 4370.44] is that
[4370.44 → 4370.66] as
[4370.66 → 4371.20] Christians
[4371.20 → 4372.10] in particular,
[4372.68 → 4373.08] we are
[4373.08 → 4374.12] called to
[4374.12 → 4375.46] merciful
[4375.46 → 4376.52] realism
[4376.52 → 4377.16] or to
[4377.16 → 4377.90] a hopeful
[4377.90 → 4378.92] realism,
[4379.10 → 4379.44] a view
[4379.44 → 4379.84] of the
[4379.84 → 4380.16] world
[4380.16 → 4381.16] that sees
[4381.16 → 4382.30] what is
[4382.30 → 4382.96] in all
[4382.96 → 4383.22] of its
[4383.22 → 4383.56] darkness
[4383.56 → 4384.26] and trouble
[4384.26 → 4385.00] and justices
[4385.00 → 4386.46] and brokenness
[4386.46 → 4387.48] and all
[4387.48 → 4387.76] of its
[4387.76 → 4388.22] good
[4388.22 → 4389.72] and celebrations
[4389.72 → 4390.66] and reasons
[4390.66 → 4391.40] to rejoice
[4391.40 → 4392.24] and in
[4392.24 → 4393.18] all of
[4393.18 → 4393.42] it
[4393.42 → 4394.08] trusts
[4394.08 → 4394.68] in
[4394.68 → 4395.30] God,
[4395.48 → 4395.92] believes
[4395.92 → 4396.26] in
[4396.26 → 4396.66] his
[4396.66 → 4397.40] purposes,
[4397.70 → 4398.00] rests
[4398.00 → 4398.76] in his
[4398.76 → 4399.50] sovereign
[4399.50 → 4400.04] plan
[4400.04 → 4400.32] and
[4400.32 → 4401.16] providential
[4401.16 → 4401.94] action
[4401.94 → 4402.86] in the
[4402.86 → 4403.18] world.
[4404.64 → 4405.42] This is
[4405.42 → 4405.86] our call.
[4408.30 → 4409.18] After all
[4409.18 → 4409.54] of his
[4409.54 → 4410.42] reflection,
[4411.94 → 4412.36] the teacher
[4412.36 → 4413.16] turns to his
[4413.16 → 4414.18] own experience
[4414.18 → 4414.80] then and he
[4414.80 → 4415.58] confesses,
[4416.00 → 4416.76] all this I
[4416.76 → 4417.44] tested by
[4417.44 → 4418.12] wisdom and
[4418.12 → 4418.30] said,
[4418.44 → 4418.80] I am
[4418.80 → 4419.22] determined
[4419.22 → 4419.60] to be
[4419.60 → 4420.06] wise
[4420.06 → 4422.14] but,
[4422.50 → 4423.26] verse 23,
[4424.00 → 4424.84] this was
[4424.84 → 4426.06] beyond me.
[4428.64 → 4429.32] So here's
[4429.32 → 4429.70] the crux
[4429.70 → 4429.94] of the
[4429.94 → 4430.10] matter.
[4430.20 → 4430.38] Here's
[4430.38 → 4431.14] the paradox
[4431.14 → 4432.52] of wisdom.
[4433.00 → 4433.64] The closer
[4433.64 → 4434.42] you come
[4434.42 → 4435.32] to understanding
[4435.32 → 4435.88] life,
[4435.94 → 4436.26] the more
[4436.26 → 4436.60] mysterious
[4436.60 → 4437.18] it becomes.
[4438.44 → 4438.92] The pursuit
[4438.92 → 4439.44] of wisdom
[4439.44 → 4440.46] doesn't expose
[4440.46 → 4441.28] our own
[4441.28 → 4442.12] strength,
[4442.30 → 4442.68] but it
[4442.68 → 4443.02] exposes
[4443.02 → 4443.60] our limits.
[4445.24 → 4445.94] Verse 24
[4445.94 → 4446.32] says,
[4446.66 → 4447.44] whatever exists
[4447.44 → 4448.18] is far off
[4448.18 → 4448.64] and most
[4448.64 → 4449.10] profound.
[4449.22 → 4449.54] Who can
[4449.54 → 4449.90] discover
[4449.90 → 4450.14] it.
[4450.46 → 4450.82] Even
[4450.82 → 4451.38] wisdom
[4451.38 → 4452.10] has its
[4452.10 → 4452.68] ceiling
[4452.68 → 4453.86] and yet,
[4454.72 → 4455.54] by grace
[4455.54 → 4456.30] through faith,
[4456.42 → 4456.98] that ceiling
[4456.98 → 4457.96] becomes a
[4457.96 → 4458.34] window.
[4458.76 → 4459.14] When we
[4459.14 → 4459.60] reach the
[4459.60 → 4460.04] end of
[4460.04 → 4460.18] our
[4460.18 → 4460.72] comprehension,
[4461.08 → 4461.36] faith
[4461.36 → 4462.04] truly
[4462.04 → 4462.96] begins and
[4462.96 → 4463.26] we can
[4463.26 → 4463.88] start to
[4463.88 → 4465.28] see God.
[4469.34 → 4469.70] So,
[4470.00 → 4471.30] at the
[4471.30 → 4471.98] very end
[4471.98 → 4473.26] of chapter
[4473.26 → 4473.68] 7,
[4474.66 → 4474.98] the teacher
[4474.98 → 4475.34] says,
[4475.66 → 4476.12] this only
[4476.12 → 4477.34] have I
[4477.34 → 4477.72] found.
[4477.72 → 4478.52] verse 29,
[4478.68 → 4478.94] God
[4478.94 → 4479.46] created
[4479.46 → 4480.04] mankind
[4480.04 → 4480.62] upright,
[4481.26 → 4481.56] but they
[4481.56 → 4481.88] have gone
[4481.88 → 4482.36] in search
[4482.36 → 4482.84] of many
[4482.84 → 4483.88] schemes.
[4485.08 → 4486.10] The core
[4486.10 → 4486.72] of biblical
[4486.72 → 4487.72] wisdom
[4487.72 → 4488.60] is that
[4488.60 → 4489.64] true wisdom
[4489.64 → 4490.60] ends not
[4490.60 → 4491.88] in self-awareness
[4491.88 → 4492.90] or self-assurance,
[4493.34 → 4493.70] but in
[4493.70 → 4494.38] surrender.
[4495.62 → 4496.04] And in
[4496.04 → 4496.76] surrendering
[4496.76 → 4497.86] ourselves to
[4497.86 → 4498.04] God,
[4498.10 → 4498.78] in seeing
[4498.78 → 4499.82] God more
[4499.82 → 4500.16] clearly,
[4500.28 → 4500.88] we actually
[4500.88 → 4501.76] finally begin
[4501.76 → 4502.28] to see
[4502.28 → 4503.10] ourselves.
[4504.00 → 4504.36] Wisdom
[4504.36 → 4504.80] isn't about
[4504.80 → 4505.36] mastery,
[4505.68 → 4506.04] it's about
[4506.04 → 4506.50] humility.
[4506.66 → 4507.04] The wise
[4507.04 → 4507.54] don't know
[4507.54 → 4508.08] everything,
[4508.34 → 4508.84] but they
[4508.84 → 4509.44] know the
[4509.44 → 4510.12] one who
[4510.12 → 4510.86] does.
[4511.46 → 4512.00] We live
[4512.00 → 4512.84] as creatures
[4512.84 → 4514.08] before the
[4514.08 → 4514.60] creator,
[4514.88 → 4515.56] resting in
[4515.56 → 4516.42] his severe
[4516.42 → 4517.64] mercies and
[4517.64 → 4518.56] trusting in
[4518.56 → 4519.52] his sovereign
[4519.52 → 4520.36] hand.
[4522.70 → 4523.54] And after
[4523.54 → 4523.96] all his
[4523.96 → 4524.34] searching,
[4525.52 → 4525.96] the teacher
[4525.96 → 4526.66] discovers what
[4526.66 → 4527.00] we all
[4527.00 → 4527.84] eventually do,
[4528.22 → 4528.80] that wisdom
[4528.80 → 4529.32] has his
[4529.32 → 4529.66] limits,
[4530.46 → 4531.38] but God
[4531.38 → 4532.02] does not.
[4532.02 → 4534.32] And in
[4534.32 → 4534.48] that
[4534.48 → 4534.98] realization,
[4535.60 → 4536.00] we find
[4536.00 → 4536.42] the heartbeat
[4536.42 → 4536.98] of faith.
[4538.56 → 4539.78] That wisdom
[4539.78 → 4540.84] is better
[4540.84 → 4542.42] than folly,
[4543.02 → 4544.00] but it
[4544.00 → 4544.68] cannot master
[4544.68 → 4545.52] life's
[4545.52 → 4546.16] crookedness.
[4546.84 → 4547.06] And so
[4547.06 → 4547.80] our hope
[4547.80 → 4549.14] rests not
[4549.14 → 4549.64] in being
[4549.64 → 4550.28] wise,
[4550.54 → 4551.26] but in
[4551.26 → 4552.02] knowing
[4552.02 → 4553.00] God.
[4554.04 → 4554.72] This is
[4554.72 → 4555.24] where the
[4555.24 → 4556.30] renewing of
[4556.30 → 4557.08] our minds
[4557.08 → 4558.24] falls down
[4558.24 → 4559.14] into the
[4559.14 → 4560.38] affections of
[4560.38 → 4561.58] our hearts,
[4561.62 → 4561.92] because
[4561.92 → 4562.78] wisdom is
[4562.78 → 4563.30] not only
[4563.30 → 4564.00] right-thinking,
[4564.24 → 4564.50] it is
[4564.50 → 4565.40] right-loving.
[4566.36 → 4566.60] And to
[4566.60 → 4567.22] see life
[4567.22 → 4567.98] clearly is
[4567.98 → 4568.52] to learn
[4568.52 → 4569.28] to love
[4569.28 → 4570.02] God
[4570.02 → 4570.82] rightly,
[4570.96 → 4571.50] to worship
[4571.50 → 4572.12] him in
[4572.12 → 4572.58] the crooked
[4572.58 → 4573.52] and in
[4573.52 → 4574.02] the straight,
[4574.12 → 4574.42] in the
[4574.42 → 4575.50] laughter and
[4575.50 → 4575.82] in the
[4575.82 → 4576.16] tears.
[4576.40 → 4576.84] That's
[4576.84 → 4577.14] where the
[4577.14 → 4577.40] teacher
[4577.40 → 4578.08] leads us.
[4578.64 → 4578.88] From
[4578.88 → 4579.32] wisdom
[4579.32 → 4579.64] that
[4579.64 → 4580.26] thinks
[4580.26 → 4581.44] to a
[4581.44 → 4581.82] wisdom
[4581.82 → 4582.34] that
[4582.34 → 4583.02] adores.
[4584.34 → 4584.76] And the
[4584.76 → 4585.26] fullness
[4585.26 → 4586.20] of this
[4586.20 → 4586.76] wisdom
[4586.76 → 4588.32] is revealed
[4588.32 → 4589.14] for us
[4589.14 → 4589.84] in Jesus
[4589.84 → 4590.38] Christ.
[4590.38 → 4591.92] He lived
[4591.92 → 4592.32] the life
[4592.32 → 4592.68] I should
[4592.68 → 4593.16] have lived
[4593.16 → 4594.14] perfectly
[4594.14 → 4595.12] obediently,
[4595.50 → 4595.92] perfectly
[4595.92 → 4596.54] trusting,
[4597.04 → 4597.48] perfectly
[4597.48 → 4598.18] loving,
[4598.66 → 4598.98] and he
[4598.98 → 4599.60] died the
[4599.60 → 4600.10] death that
[4600.10 → 4601.04] I deserve,
[4601.16 → 4601.60] taking the
[4601.60 → 4602.24] consequences
[4602.24 → 4603.12] of my
[4603.12 → 4604.04] folly and
[4604.04 → 4604.72] my failure
[4604.72 → 4605.54] upon himself.
[4606.02 → 4606.32] And in
[4606.32 → 4606.76] him,
[4607.12 → 4608.02] the crookedness
[4608.02 → 4608.58] of all
[4608.58 → 4609.50] life finds
[4609.50 → 4610.24] its answer.
[4610.58 → 4611.12] In him,
[4611.26 → 4611.96] the limits
[4611.96 → 4612.76] of human
[4612.76 → 4613.40] understanding
[4613.40 → 4613.92] are met
[4613.92 → 4614.72] with divine
[4614.72 → 4615.72] understanding,
[4615.72 → 4616.12] and the
[4616.12 → 4617.20] severe mercies
[4617.20 → 4617.72] of God
[4617.72 → 4618.28] find their
[4618.28 → 4618.86] ultimate
[4618.86 → 4619.72] expression
[4619.72 → 4620.44] in the
[4620.44 → 4620.88] person
[4620.88 → 4621.68] of Jesus
[4621.68 → 4622.26] Christ.
[4622.56 → 4622.80] Jesus
[4622.80 → 4623.22] Christ,
[4623.30 → 4623.66] who Paul
[4623.66 → 4624.20] says in
[4624.20 → 4624.78] 1 Corinthians
[4624.78 → 4625.10] 1,
[4625.16 → 4625.56] 24,
[4626.00 → 4626.38] is the
[4626.38 → 4626.82] wisdom
[4626.82 → 4627.58] of God
[4627.58 → 4628.42] and the
[4628.42 → 4628.82] power
[4628.82 → 4629.46] of God.
[4630.80 → 4631.16] So where
[4631.16 → 4631.98] my striving
[4631.98 → 4632.84] falls short,
[4633.00 → 4633.68] he perfectly
[4633.68 → 4634.30] fulfills.
[4634.50 → 4634.96] Where my
[4634.96 → 4635.58] understanding
[4635.58 → 4636.26] reaches his
[4636.26 → 4636.60] ceiling,
[4636.86 → 4637.54] he opens
[4637.54 → 4637.90] up the
[4637.90 → 4638.36] window of
[4638.36 → 4638.56] faith.
[4638.66 → 4639.08] Where my
[4639.08 → 4639.34] hope
[4639.34 → 4639.82] falters,
[4640.14 → 4640.96] he secures
[4640.96 → 4641.18] it.
[4641.46 → 4642.00] To behold
[4642.00 → 4642.80] him is to
[4642.80 → 4643.62] see wisdom
[4643.62 → 4644.30] not as an
[4644.30 → 4644.66] abstract
[4644.66 → 4645.38] principle,
[4645.38 → 4646.44] but as a
[4646.44 → 4646.82] living,
[4647.30 → 4647.68] loving,
[4648.06 → 4648.64] redeeming
[4648.64 → 4649.60] God who
[4649.60 → 4650.56] meets us
[4650.56 → 4651.26] in the
[4651.26 → 4652.24] brokenness
[4652.24 → 4652.76] and the
[4652.76 → 4653.30] crookedness,
[4653.40 → 4653.72] in the
[4653.72 → 4654.30] suffering,
[4654.76 → 4655.36] and in the
[4655.36 → 4656.46] mysteries of
[4656.46 → 4656.86] life,
[4657.02 → 4657.28] and who
[4657.28 → 4658.54] draws our
[4658.54 → 4659.96] hearts to
[4659.96 → 4660.50] himself.
[4662.72 → 4663.44] Wisdom
[4663.44 → 4665.06] shapes our
[4665.06 → 4666.66] hearts just
[4666.66 → 4667.44] as much as
[4667.44 → 4668.02] our minds.
[4669.24 → 4669.72] And to see
[4669.72 → 4670.68] life clearly
[4670.68 → 4671.78] is to worship
[4671.78 → 4672.72] rightly,
[4672.86 → 4673.52] to learn the
[4673.52 → 4674.18] posture of
[4674.18 → 4675.28] adoration in
[4675.28 → 4675.76] the midst
[4675.76 → 4676.42] of the
[4676.42 → 4676.96] straight or
[4676.96 → 4677.26] crooked,
[4677.36 → 4677.92] the joyful or
[4677.92 → 4678.34] the painful.
[4678.74 → 4679.64] Christian worship
[4679.64 → 4680.86] isn't just
[4680.86 → 4682.24] Sunday music
[4682.24 → 4683.16] or Sunday
[4683.16 → 4683.84] ritual,
[4684.10 → 4684.52] it's the
[4684.52 → 4685.80] orientation of
[4685.80 → 4686.82] the heart to
[4686.82 → 4687.52] God in
[4687.52 → 4688.94] every moment.
[4689.84 → 4690.36] It's the
[4690.36 → 4691.02] love that
[4691.02 → 4692.34] flows from
[4692.34 → 4693.22] understanding
[4693.22 → 4694.52] the Father's
[4694.52 → 4696.10] hand holding
[4696.10 → 4697.58] the world
[4697.58 → 4698.96] and therefore
[4698.96 → 4700.84] holding you.
[4700.84 → 4702.84] God's
[4702.84 → 4704.32] love that
[4704.32 → 4705.28] will
[4705.28 → 4705.92] be.
[4705.92 → 4706.16] And as we
[4706.16 → 4706.58] move from
[4706.58 → 4707.58] head to
[4707.58 → 4708.92] heart to
[4708.92 → 4710.24] hands, we
[4710.24 → 4711.00] ask, how do
[4711.00 → 4711.84] we then live
[4711.84 → 4712.60] this wisdom
[4712.60 → 4713.56] out?
[4714.12 → 4714.50] The teacher
[4714.50 → 4715.54] points to a
[4715.54 → 4716.20] pattern of
[4716.20 → 4717.66] merciful realism
[4717.66 → 4718.60] and the gospel
[4718.60 → 4719.52] and the work of
[4719.52 → 4720.22] the Holy Spirit
[4720.22 → 4721.28] gives us power
[4721.28 → 4722.62] to pursue it.
[4722.76 → 4723.46] And so last
[4723.46 → 4724.68] week, Kevin
[4724.68 → 4725.76] talked about
[4725.76 → 4727.06] spiritual disciplines
[4727.06 → 4728.30] as rhythms
[4728.30 → 4729.66] of resistance.
[4731.10 → 4731.74] These spiritual
[4731.74 → 4732.42] disciplines are
[4732.42 → 4732.90] not about
[4732.90 → 4734.00] achieving mastery
[4734.00 → 4735.16] over life,
[4735.18 → 4735.60] but about
[4735.60 → 4736.82] forming a
[4736.82 → 4737.68] heart that
[4737.68 → 4738.54] rests in
[4738.54 → 4739.40] God, that
[4739.40 → 4740.38] loves rightly
[4740.38 → 4741.28] and responds
[4741.28 → 4742.30] in worship
[4742.30 → 4742.92] no matter what
[4742.92 → 4744.12] is happening.
[4744.48 → 4745.20] If the head
[4745.20 → 4745.92] trains our
[4745.92 → 4746.78] minds and the
[4746.78 → 4747.50] heart trains
[4747.50 → 4748.46] our affections,
[4748.76 → 4749.40] the hands
[4749.40 → 4750.26] train our
[4750.26 → 4751.12] daily lives.
[4752.70 → 4753.56] So Ecclesiastes
[4753.56 → 4754.46] 7 isn't going
[4754.46 → 4755.26] to leave us
[4755.26 → 4755.80] with these
[4755.80 → 4757.18] abstract ideas,
[4757.32 → 4757.96] but rather it's
[4757.96 → 4758.72] going to call
[4758.72 → 4759.32] us to
[4759.32 → 4760.68] practical rhythms
[4760.68 → 4761.76] that shape us
[4761.76 → 4762.48] as disciples
[4762.48 → 4763.60] of Jesus.
[4764.66 → 4765.04] And so to
[4765.04 → 4765.78] end our time
[4765.78 → 4767.28] in the word
[4767.28 → 4767.88] this morning,
[4768.10 → 4769.28] I will name
[4769.28 → 4770.40] just three.
[4772.16 → 4772.70] We are
[4772.70 → 4773.24] called
[4773.24 → 4774.90] to prayers
[4774.90 → 4775.68] of trust
[4775.68 → 4776.94] in the midst
[4776.94 → 4777.60] of suffering.
[4779.42 → 4779.88] And so maybe
[4779.88 → 4780.54] we pray,
[4780.70 → 4781.54] Lord, don't
[4781.54 → 4782.62] waste this pain,
[4783.16 → 4783.74] teach me your
[4783.74 → 4784.06] hand.
[4785.84 → 4786.50] And this will
[4786.50 → 4787.24] teach us
[4787.24 → 4788.24] reliance on
[4788.24 → 4789.12] God's provision,
[4789.72 → 4790.42] not our
[4790.42 → 4791.32] mastery or
[4791.32 → 4792.22] our fawning
[4792.22 → 4793.06] for control.
[4793.66 → 4794.50] And this will
[4794.50 → 4796.04] form in us
[4796.04 → 4797.24] a resilient
[4797.24 → 4798.44] hope.
[4799.90 → 4800.32] And so we
[4800.32 → 4800.54] pray,
[4800.70 → 4801.40] Lord, don't
[4801.40 → 4802.24] waste this
[4802.24 → 4802.96] pain.
[4804.00 → 4804.62] Teach me
[4804.62 → 4805.34] to see your
[4805.34 → 4805.64] hand.
[4806.66 → 4807.48] Second, we are
[4807.48 → 4808.02] called to
[4808.02 → 4809.02] rhythms of
[4809.02 → 4809.60] reflection.
[4809.86 → 4810.56] And so maybe
[4810.56 → 4811.38] on your heart
[4811.38 → 4811.78] you pray,
[4811.86 → 4812.78] God, graciously
[4812.78 → 4813.96] remind me that
[4813.96 → 4814.66] my life is
[4814.66 → 4815.36] finite, but
[4815.36 → 4815.90] you are
[4815.90 → 4816.50] sovereign and
[4816.50 → 4817.32] your providential
[4817.32 → 4818.34] hand is over
[4818.34 → 4818.86] all things.
[4819.24 → 4820.38] And this will
[4820.38 → 4822.02] work in you
[4822.02 → 4822.84] to counter
[4822.84 → 4823.94] the instinct
[4823.94 → 4825.06] to escape
[4825.06 → 4825.80] or to
[4825.80 → 4826.86] numb or
[4826.86 → 4828.14] to chase
[4828.14 → 4828.98] constant
[4828.98 → 4830.20] productivity or
[4830.20 → 4831.12] whatever it
[4831.12 → 4832.24] is and allow
[4832.24 → 4833.24] us instead
[4833.24 → 4834.26] in these
[4834.26 → 4835.04] rhythms of
[4835.04 → 4836.26] reflection to
[4836.26 → 4838.28] rest in
[4838.28 → 4839.80] God.
[4839.80 → 4841.80] rest in
[4841.80 → 4842.40] life.
[4842.40 → 4842.46] And I
[4842.46 → 4842.86] think most
[4842.86 → 4843.44] of us
[4843.44 → 4844.52] could use
[4844.52 → 4844.88] some more
[4844.88 → 4846.58] resting right
[4846.58 → 4846.88] now.
[4848.46 → 4849.08] And lastly,
[4849.24 → 4849.74] we are called
[4849.74 → 4850.40] to receive
[4850.40 → 4850.96] faithful
[4850.96 → 4851.58] correction.
[4852.92 → 4853.28] And so we
[4853.28 → 4853.86] pray, Jesus,
[4854.46 → 4855.10] bring trusted
[4855.10 → 4856.02] friends, bring
[4856.02 → 4857.16] spiritual mentors,
[4857.60 → 4858.60] bring discipling
[4858.60 → 4859.64] voices into
[4859.64 → 4861.00] my life that
[4861.00 → 4861.92] you might
[4861.92 → 4862.98] speak to my
[4862.98 → 4863.80] heart through
[4863.80 → 4864.48] them.
[4865.68 → 4866.66] And this will
[4866.66 → 4867.52] train our hearts
[4867.52 → 4868.78] to see severe
[4868.78 → 4869.90] mercies as
[4869.90 → 4871.50] mercies, to
[4871.50 → 4872.24] see faithful
[4872.24 → 4873.10] wounds as
[4873.10 → 4874.38] faithful and
[4874.38 → 4875.88] friendly, and
[4875.88 → 4876.76] to receive
[4876.76 → 4877.58] fatherly
[4877.58 → 4879.02] chastisements as
[4879.02 → 4880.02] the actions of
[4880.02 → 4881.42] a truly loving
[4881.42 → 4882.28] God.
[4883.74 → 4885.54] Wisdom cannot
[4885.54 → 4887.06] straighten life's
[4887.06 → 4888.50] crookedness or
[4888.50 → 4889.84] calm your
[4889.84 → 4891.38] life's chaos,
[4892.26 → 4893.80] but Jesus
[4893.80 → 4894.16] can.
[4896.16 → 4897.40] Rest in
[4897.40 → 4897.58] him.
[4898.78 → 4899.66] Love
[4899.66 → 4900.32] him.
[4901.24 → 4901.72] Walk
[4901.72 → 4902.40] faithfully
[4902.40 → 4903.26] with him
[4903.26 → 4903.92] and build
[4903.92 → 4904.50] rhythms
[4904.50 → 4906.30] with him.
[4907.50 → 4908.60] The same
[4908.60 → 4909.92] hand that
[4909.92 → 4910.82] shapes the
[4910.82 → 4911.16] crooked,
[4912.46 → 4913.04] guides your
[4913.04 → 4913.52] steps,
[4914.92 → 4916.34] and guides
[4916.34 → 4917.44] all of
[4917.44 → 4917.92] history.
[4919.02 → 4919.44] And in
[4919.44 → 4921.02] him we
[4921.02 → 4921.56] rest.
[4922.40 → 4923.06] Let's pray
[4923.06 → 4923.36] together.
[4923.36 → 4923.46] Amen.
[4923.46 → 4923.50] Amen.
[4923.50 → 4923.54] Amen.
[4923.54 → 4923.56] Amen.
[4923.56 → 4923.60] Amen.
[4923.60 → 4923.62] Amen.
[4928.78 → 4929.82] Holy
[4929.82 → 4930.32] Father, we
[4930.32 → 4931.70] come to
[4931.70 → 4932.30] your table.
[4933.64 → 4934.34] Allow us
[4934.34 → 4936.12] to rest in
[4936.12 → 4937.96] you here.
[4939.96 → 4941.38] Fill us to
[4941.38 → 4942.48] overflowing with
[4942.48 → 4943.24] your mercy and
[4943.24 → 4944.40] love that it
[4944.40 → 4945.06] might spill
[4945.06 → 4946.64] forward from
[4946.64 → 4947.04] us.
[4948.80 → 4949.80] Meet us in
[4949.80 → 4950.92] this moment with
[4950.92 → 4952.30] hopeful
[4952.30 → 4953.18] realism
[4953.18 → 4955.24] wisdom, that
[4955.24 → 4955.96] we might go
[4955.96 → 4957.58] empowered and
[4957.58 → 4958.56] sustained into
[4958.56 → 4959.56] the days and
[4959.56 → 4960.54] week ahead.
[4961.44 → 4962.24] We pray this,
[4962.36 → 4962.98] Jesus, in your
[4962.98 → 4964.04] holy name.
[4965.04 → 4965.36] Amen.
[4965.36 → 4975.16] We are about
[4975.16 → 4976.02] to come to
[4976.02 → 4976.48] the table
[4976.48 → 4978.04] together, not
[4978.04 → 4978.82] because we are
[4978.82 → 4980.22] wise, not
[4980.22 → 4980.78] because we are
[4980.78 → 4982.82] foolish, because
[4982.82 → 4983.70] God calls us
[4983.70 → 4984.68] to, because this
[4984.68 → 4985.46] is the place where
[4985.46 → 4987.60] we are invited to
[4987.60 → 4988.20] commune with
[4988.20 → 4988.46] Jesus.
[4989.62 → 4990.32] And so we are
[4990.32 → 4991.08] invited to come
[4991.08 → 4991.74] whether we are
[4991.74 → 4992.50] falling apart
[4992.50 → 4993.08] right now,
[4993.82 → 4994.68] whether we are
[4994.68 → 4995.06] broken,
[4995.36 → 4996.82] whether we are
[4996.82 → 4997.76] being gently
[4997.76 → 4998.72] put back together
[4998.72 → 4999.50] or whether we
[4999.50 → 4999.94] are feeling
[4999.94 → 5000.50] whole.
[5000.76 → 5001.74] We are called
[5001.74 → 5003.02] to come and
[5003.02 → 5003.80] dine together
[5003.80 → 5004.84] with Christ who
[5004.84 → 5006.36] joins us around
[5006.36 → 5007.40] this table.
[5008.48 → 5009.36] So, brothers and
[5009.36 → 5009.78] sisters, that
[5009.78 → 5011.20] Emmanuel lift
[5011.20 → 5012.14] your hearts.
[5013.12 → 5016.72] It is, let us
[5016.72 → 5017.62] give thanks to
[5017.62 → 5018.58] the Lord our
[5018.58 → 5019.20] God.
[5022.08 → 5022.84] Let's pray.
[5022.84 → 5025.46] with joy we
[5025.46 → 5026.12] praise you,
[5026.28 → 5027.02] gracious God,
[5027.66 → 5028.18] for you have
[5028.18 → 5029.04] created heaven
[5029.04 → 5030.26] and earth,
[5030.38 → 5031.28] made us in
[5031.28 → 5031.94] your image,
[5032.08 → 5032.56] and kept
[5032.56 → 5033.86] covenant with
[5033.86 → 5035.46] us, even
[5035.46 → 5036.08] when we fell
[5036.08 → 5036.60] into sin.
[5037.88 → 5038.66] We give you
[5038.66 → 5039.16] thanks for
[5039.16 → 5039.92] Jesus Christ,
[5040.04 → 5040.98] who by his
[5040.98 → 5041.82] life, death,
[5042.16 → 5042.88] and resurrection
[5042.88 → 5044.34] opened to us
[5044.34 → 5045.44] the way of
[5045.44 → 5046.94] everlasting life.
[5047.74 → 5048.04] Amen.
[5048.04 → 5051.60] Jesus, before
[5051.60 → 5052.26] he suffered,
[5052.40 → 5053.20] gave us this
[5053.20 → 5054.32] memorial of
[5054.32 → 5055.38] this sacrifice
[5055.38 → 5056.22] until he
[5056.22 → 5056.82] comes again.
[5057.96 → 5058.72] The Lord Jesus,
[5058.88 → 5059.46] on the night he
[5059.46 → 5060.18] was betrayed,
[5060.32 → 5060.84] took bread,
[5061.50 → 5062.22] and after he
[5062.22 → 5062.54] had given
[5062.54 → 5063.10] thanks, he
[5063.10 → 5063.68] broke it
[5063.68 → 5066.56] and said,
[5066.56 → 5068.16] this is my
[5068.16 → 5069.40] body, which
[5069.40 → 5069.80] is given
[5069.80 → 5070.34] for you.
[5070.98 → 5071.48] Do this
[5071.48 → 5072.14] in remembrance
[5072.14 → 5072.76] of me.
[5074.28 → 5075.20] In the same
[5075.20 → 5075.98] way, after
[5075.98 → 5077.68] supper, he
[5077.68 → 5077.98] took the
[5077.98 → 5078.78] cup, saying,
[5080.24 → 5083.52] this cup
[5083.52 → 5084.66] is the new
[5084.66 → 5085.68] covenant in
[5085.68 → 5086.24] my blood.
[5086.84 → 5087.30] Do this
[5087.30 → 5087.94] whenever you
[5087.94 → 5088.50] drink it
[5088.50 → 5089.36] in remembrance
[5089.36 → 5090.00] of me.
[5090.72 → 5091.20] For whenever
[5091.20 → 5091.98] you eat this
[5091.98 → 5092.58] bread and
[5092.58 → 5093.28] drink this
[5093.28 → 5094.82] cup, you
[5094.82 → 5095.70] proclaim the
[5095.70 → 5096.38] Lord's death
[5096.38 → 5097.30] until he
[5097.30 → 5098.12] comes again.
[5099.84 → 5101.32] This is
[5101.32 → 5101.84] the mystery
[5101.84 → 5102.36] of our
[5102.36 → 5102.66] faith.
[5104.06 → 5104.62] For the death
[5104.62 → 5105.40] of Christ
[5105.40 → 5106.30] we proclaim,
[5107.00 → 5107.24] for the
[5107.24 → 5107.92] resurrection
[5107.92 → 5108.78] we affirm
[5108.78 → 5109.52] joy,
[5110.26 → 5110.50] for the
[5110.50 → 5110.90] coming
[5110.90 → 5111.58] we give
[5111.58 → 5112.24] you hope.
[5112.90 → 5113.64] Glory be
[5113.64 → 5114.14] to you,
[5114.26 → 5114.92] Lord Jesus.
[5116.12 → 5117.02] Church family,
[5117.10 → 5117.58] the Lord has
[5117.58 → 5118.30] prepared this
[5118.30 → 5119.22] table for all
[5119.22 → 5119.96] who love him
[5119.96 → 5121.10] and trust in
[5121.10 → 5121.82] him alone for
[5121.82 → 5122.48] their salvation,
[5122.64 → 5123.22] and so come.
[5123.76 → 5124.24] Come,
[5124.24 → 5125.38] those to
[5125.38 → 5126.02] this table,
[5126.60 → 5126.98] you who
[5126.98 → 5127.50] have much
[5127.50 → 5127.90] faith,
[5128.56 → 5129.18] or you who
[5129.18 → 5129.72] have little,
[5130.98 → 5131.40] you who
[5131.40 → 5131.86] would like to
[5131.86 → 5132.46] have more.
[5133.66 → 5134.66] Come to
[5134.66 → 5135.46] this table,
[5136.46 → 5137.62] you who
[5137.62 → 5138.22] have been to
[5138.22 → 5138.80] this sacrament
[5138.80 → 5139.30] often,
[5140.30 → 5141.88] and you who
[5141.88 → 5142.46] have not been
[5142.46 → 5143.00] for a long
[5143.00 → 5143.36] time.
[5144.56 → 5145.42] You who have
[5145.42 → 5146.02] tried to
[5146.02 → 5146.72] follow Jesus,
[5146.98 → 5147.54] and you
[5147.54 → 5149.32] who have
[5149.32 → 5149.62] failed.
[5150.84 → 5151.86] Come to
[5151.86 → 5152.54] this table,
[5152.88 → 5153.62] because Jesus
[5153.62 → 5155.52] is raised.
[5156.78 → 5157.52] Come if you
[5157.52 → 5158.12] are here,
[5158.34 → 5158.92] or if you
[5158.92 → 5159.54] are at home
[5159.54 → 5160.50] and online.
[5161.68 → 5162.50] It is Christ
[5162.50 → 5163.48] who invites us
[5163.48 → 5164.24] to meet him
[5164.24 → 5164.62] here.
[5166.50 → 5167.26] These are the
[5167.26 → 5168.06] gifts of God
[5168.06 → 5169.02] for the people
[5169.02 → 5169.58] of God.
[5172.38 → 5173.34] As we partake
[5173.34 → 5174.00] in this supper
[5174.00 → 5174.60] together,
[5174.82 → 5175.40] the elders
[5175.40 → 5176.40] will be inviting
[5176.40 → 5177.08] you together
[5177.08 → 5178.10] row by row,
[5178.22 → 5178.74] and so when it
[5178.74 → 5179.30] is your turn,
[5179.36 → 5179.76] we are going to
[5179.76 → 5180.60] gather around
[5180.60 → 5181.28] this table
[5181.28 → 5182.32] together here
[5182.32 → 5183.24] at the front.
[5183.34 → 5183.72] Families,
[5183.98 → 5184.58] we invite you
[5184.58 → 5185.02] to come up
[5185.02 → 5185.48] with your
[5185.48 → 5186.30] children as well,
[5186.38 → 5186.76] whether they
[5186.76 → 5187.12] are going to
[5187.12 → 5187.96] partake or not.
[5188.02 → 5188.44] We would love
[5188.44 → 5189.24] for them to
[5189.24 → 5189.82] be up here
[5189.82 → 5190.32] with us.
[5190.80 → 5191.42] In the middle
[5191.42 → 5192.22] of each tray
[5192.22 → 5192.82] of bread,
[5192.90 → 5193.52] there is also
[5193.52 → 5194.68] a cup that
[5194.68 → 5195.68] has gluten-free
[5195.68 → 5196.28] bread,
[5196.36 → 5196.80] so if that is
[5196.80 → 5197.20] something that
[5197.20 → 5197.48] you need,
[5197.54 → 5198.08] we have that
[5198.08 → 5198.84] available for
[5198.84 → 5199.98] you as well.
[5200.66 → 5201.34] If you are
[5201.34 → 5202.06] unable to
[5202.06 → 5202.58] come forward
[5202.58 → 5203.34] for any reason
[5203.34 → 5203.78] at all,

[5701.56 → 5713.76] Your only Son, no sin to hide, but you have sent Him from your side
[5713.76 → 5725.14] to walk upon this guilty soft and to become the Lamb of God.
[5725.14 → 5739.42] The gift of love they crucified, they laughed and scorned Him as He died.
[5739.42 → 5750.86] The humble King they named a fraud and sacrificed the Lamb of God.
[5750.86 → 5762.00] O Lamb of God, sweet Lamb of God, I love the Holy Lamb of God.
[5762.00 → 5773.66] O wash me in His precious blood, my Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God.
[5773.66 → 5786.80] I was so lost, I should have died, but you have brought me to your side
[5786.80 → 5797.94] to be led by your staff and rod and to become the Lamb of God.
[5797.94 → 5809.08] O Lamb of God, sweet Lamb of God, I love the Holy Lamb of God.
[5809.08 → 5820.22] O wash me in His precious blood, my Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God.
[5820.22 → 5831.36] O Lamb of God, sweet Lamb of God, I love the Holy Lamb of God.
[5831.36 → 5843.36] O wash me in His precious blood, my Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God.
[5843.36 → 5856.50] O Lord, sweet Lamb of God.
[5856.50 → 5857.50] O Saviour, sweet Lamb of God

[5900.66 → 5908.28] My God, like you there is no other
[5908.28 → 5915.34] True delight is found in you alone
[5915.34 → 5923.62] Your grace, a world too deep to fathom
[5923.62 → 5930.76] Your love exceeds the heavens' reach
[5930.76 → 5937.76] Your truth, a fount of perfect wisdom
[5937.76 → 5945.68] My highest good and my unending need
[5945.68 → 5956.50] Oh Lord, my rock and my redeemer

[5994.68 → 6000.60] My joy when trials are abounding
[6000.60 → 6008.60] Your faithfulness, my refuge in the night
[6008.60 → 6018.52] Oh Lord, my rock and my redeemer
[6018.52 → 6026.44] Gracious Saviour of my ruined life
[6026.44 → 6033.72] My guilt and cross laid on your shoulders
[6033.72 → 6040.44] In my place you suffered, bled and died
[6040.44 → 6048.36] You rose, the grave and death are conquered
[6048.36 → 6056.36] You broke my bonds of sin and shame
[6056.36 → 6070.28] You broke my bonds of sin and shame
[6070.28 → 6072.20] You broke my bonds of sin and shame
[6072.20 → 6078.20] Oh Lord, my rock and my redeemer
[6078.20 → 6086.12] May all my days bring glory to your name
[6086.12 → 6092.12] Oh Lord, my rock and my redeemer
[6092.12 → 6100.12] May all my days bring glory to your name

[6106.04 → 6117.96] frustrating
[6117.96 → 6143.76] What is our hope in life and death?
[6143.76 → 6153.54] Christ alone, Christ alone, what is our only confidence?
[6154.20 → 6158.52] That our souls to Him belong.
[6159.00 → 6163.60] Who holds our days within His hand?
[6163.98 → 6168.12] What comes apart from His command?
[6168.12 → 6173.76] And what will keep us to the end?
[6174.24 → 6179.12] The love of Christ in which we stand.
[6182.24 → 6186.50] Oh, sing hallelujah.
[6187.58 → 6191.62] Our hope springs eternal.
[6191.62 → 6196.72] Oh, sing hallelujah.
[6197.36 → 6200.62] Now and ever we confess.
[6201.60 → 6205.62] Christ our hope in life and death.
[6205.62 → 6206.22] Amen.
[6212.76 → 6217.70] What truth can calm the troubled soul?
[6218.34 → 6220.22] God is good.
[6221.00 → 6222.82] God is good.
[6223.24 → 6227.82] And with His grace and goodness known.
[6227.82 → 6232.88] In our great Redeemer's blood
[6232.88 → 6237.94] Who holds our faith when fears arise
[6237.94 → 6242.94] Who stands above the stormy trial
[6242.94 → 6248.18] Who sends the waves that bring us night
[6248.18 → 6253.88] Unto the shore of the rock of Christ
[6253.88 → 6260.76] Oh, sing hallelujah
[6260.76 → 6265.82] Our hope springs eternal
[6265.82 → 6270.78] Oh, sing hallelujah
[6270.78 → 6275.12] Now and ever we confess
[6275.12 → 6279.90] Christ our hope in life and death
[6279.90 → 6291.74] To the grave, what will we sing?
[6292.54 → 6296.96] Christ he lives, Christ he lives
[6296.96 → 6302.04] And what reward will heaven bring?
[6304.04 → 6306.96] Everlasting life within
[6306.96 → 6312.22] There we will rise to meet the Lord
[6312.22 → 6317.10] When sin and death will be destroyed
[6317.10 → 6322.32] And we will feast in endless joy
[6322.32 → 6329.10] With Christ in God forevermore
[6329.10 → 6334.10] Oh, sing hallelujah
[6334.10 → 6339.78] Our hope springs eternal
[6339.78 → 6344.10] Oh, sing hallelujah
[6344.10 → 6349.06] Now and ever we confess
[6349.06 → 6353.40] Christ our hope in life and death
[6353.40 → 6358.40] Oh, sing hallelujah
[6358.40 → 6363.02] Our hope springs eternal
[6363.02 → 6367.40] Oh, sing hallelujah
[6367.40 → 6369.40] Now and ever we confess
[6369.40 → 6371.40] Now and ever we confess
[6371.40 → 6376.40] Christ our hope in life and death
[6376.40 → 6379.40] Now and ever we confess
[6379.40 → 6385.40] Christ our hope in life and death
[6385.40 → 6391.40] Let us wait
[6391.40 → 6395.68] Oh, sing hallelujah
[6395.68 → 6425.66] piano plays softly
[6425.68 → 6428.36] beyond all measure
[6428.36 → 6434.52] that he should give his only Son
[6434.52 → 6439.54] and make a wretch his treasure.
[6440.76 → 6445.80] How great the pain of searing loss
[6445.80 → 6451.12] the Father turns his face away
[6451.12 → 6456.12] as wounds which mar the chosen dawn
[6456.84 → 6461.80] bring many sons to glory.
[6461.80 → 6471.80] piano plays softly
[6471.80 → 6477.14] Behold the man upon a cross
[6477.14 → 6482.12] My sin upon his shoulders
[6482.12 → 6488.24] Ashamed I hear my mocking voice
[6488.24 → 6493.68] Call out among the softer
[6493.68 → 6499.20] It was my sin that held him there
[6499.20 → 6503.72] Until it was accomplished
[6503.72 → 6509.62] His dying breath has brought me dry
[6509.62 → 6515.34] I know that it is sinning
[6515.34 → 6529.02] I will not boast in any name
[6529.02 → 6533.58] No gifts, no power, no wisdom
[6533.58 → 6539.90] But I will boast in Jesus Christ
[6539.90 → 6544.10] His death and resurrection
[6544.10 → 6549.38] Why should I gain from his reward?
[6549.38 → 6554.58] I cannot give an answer
[6554.58 → 6560.90] But this I know with all my heart
[6560.90 → 6565.34] His wounds I paid my ransom
[6565.34 → 6570.58] What should I gain from his reward?
[6570.58 → 6576.58] I cannot give an answer
[6576.58 → 6583.22] But this I know with all my heart
[6583.22 → 6588.74] His wounds I paid my ransom
[6588.74 → 6594.68] While you remain standing
[6594.68 → 6596.06] I invite you just to pray with me
[6596.06 → 6599.14] Oh amazing God
[6599.14 → 6601.28] You come into our ordinary lives
[6601.28 → 6603.68] And you have set this table among us
[6603.68 → 6605.82] God you have filled our plates
[6605.82 → 6606.86] With bread of life
[6606.86 → 6608.08] And with cups of salvation
[6608.08 → 6610.06] And now God as we are sent out
[6610.06 → 6612.36] We pray that with tender-heartedness
[6612.36 → 6615.28] You will touch an ordinary everyday world
[6615.28 → 6617.50] With the promise of your holiness
[6617.50 → 6618.70] Amen
[6618.70 → 6622.02] And so as we go out from this place
[6622.02 → 6625.18] Let us remember who our God is
[6625.18 → 6627.96] That he invites us into fellowship with him
[6627.96 → 6631.84] And sends us out to declare his name
[6631.84 → 6633.34] To the surrounding community
[6633.34 → 6635.16] And as we go from this place
[6635.16 → 6637.38] Please receive this parting blessing
[6637.38 → 6641.22] The Lord bless you and keep you
[6641.22 → 6644.18] The Lord make his face shine upon you
[6644.18 → 6645.32] And be gracious to you
[6645.32 → 6648.00] The Lord turn his face toward you
[6648.00 → 6650.24] And give you his peace
[6650.24 → 6652.18] And all of God's people said
[6652.18 → 6653.40] Amen
[6653.40 → 6655.38] piano plays softly
[6655.38 → 6685.36] Thank you.
[6685.38 → 6715.36] Thank you.
[6715.38 → 6717.38] Thank you.
[6745.38 → 6760.38] Declaring aloud, praise and glory, wisdom and faith, honour and power and strength.
[6760.38 → 6766.38] Be to our God forever and ever.
[6766.38 → 6771.38] Be to our God forever and ever.
[6771.38 → 6776.38] Be to our God forever and ever.
