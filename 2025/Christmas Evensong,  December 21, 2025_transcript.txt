[455.38 --> 473.38]  Good evening everyone and welcome to this Evensong Christmas service. Whether you're a member of this church or a guest visiting today, we are just so glad that you are here tonight.
[473.38 --> 481.38]  Before we begin, I want to thank actually a whole bunch of people. But before I thank a whole bunch of people, I want to make one little announcement.
[481.38 --> 489.38]  You were given a candle on the way in. That candle is, well at least we're planning on this, going to be used at the very end of the service.
[489.38 --> 496.38]  So if you happen to have like a lighter in your pocket and we're planning on lighting that randomly throughout, we're just going to encourage you not to do that.
[496.38 --> 504.38]  Hang on to those. We're going to use those at the very end. There will be instructions so you will be adequately informed as to what to do.
[504.38 --> 513.38]  A few thank yous today already. Just I thought we'd start with this. This wonderful worship team behind me is going to be leading us in our worship tonight.
[513.38 --> 524.38]  And they've been working very, very hard for the last couple weeks. And so I just want to thank Ken on the piano, Seth on the guitar, Kobe on the drums, Denise on the keys, Peter, Mel, Sarah and Ava who are going to be singing away.
[524.38 --> 533.38]  And Andy on the mandolin and whatever other instruments he decides to pull out of his pocket. We're also very pleased to have some special guests joining us tonight.
[533.38 --> 543.38]  Andy's friend Andy. There's two of them. Andy is also going to be here. He's on the guitar behind me as well, as well as Nadia and her daughter Olivia on the violin over here.
[543.38 --> 549.38]  Later in the service, actually, the two Andys and Nadia and Olivia are going to be joined by Karen and Ivy.
[549.38 --> 557.38]  And they're going to sing a song called Marvelous Light, which is a song that Andy wrote and was performed by this group when they were a band called the Pacific Salt.
[557.38 --> 562.38]  And so we're looking forward to that as well. Also in the service, we're going to hear an octet.
[562.38 --> 572.38]  They're going to sing What Child Is This? And that is going to be followed up with a whole number of Christmas songs tonight as well that we're all going to participate in singing.
[572.38 --> 576.38]  So we're looking forward to all of that. Throughout the night, you're also going to hear readings.
[576.38 --> 582.38]  We're going to hear the Christmas story as Scripture tells it. And the readings are going to be done by these three over here from Atang and Kezia and Alyssa.
[582.38 --> 586.38]  So we thank you for that, too. And after the service is done, you're, of course, invited out.
[586.38 --> 590.38]  We're going to have some fellowship and some hot chocolate out in the foyer. So do stick around for that.
[590.38 --> 597.38]  My prayer tonight, our prayer for tonight, is that as we make our way through the Christmas story, this Christmas story is found in Scripture,
[597.38 --> 605.38]  that we're all drawn a little closer to God and a little closer to what he has accomplished with this baby Savior of ours.
[605.38 --> 609.38]  I usually do this at the top. I'm going to do this at the end. My name is Kevin Lobert. I'm one of the pastors here.
[609.38 --> 615.38]  And now I'd love to invite you all up to receive God's greeting this evening.
[615.38 --> 617.38]  So please do stand.
[617.38 --> 625.38]  My hands are full. God's greeting. They're here. Hold this. Yeah, there we go. Thanks, Peter.
[625.38 --> 627.38]  God's greeting comes to us from Revelation.
[627.38 --> 631.38]  Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come,
[631.38 --> 636.38]  and from the seven spirits that are before his throne, and by Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness,
[636.38 --> 641.38]  the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler, the kings of the earth. Amen.
[641.38 --> 661.38]  This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about. His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph,
[661.38 --> 666.38]  but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
[666.38 --> 672.38]  Because Joseph, her husband, was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace,
[672.38 --> 676.38]  he had in mind to divorce her quietly.
[676.38 --> 681.38]  But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said,
[681.38 --> 686.38]  Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife,
[686.38 --> 689.38]  because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
[689.38 --> 692.38]  She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus,
[692.38 --> 695.38]  because he will save his people from their sins.
[695.38 --> 700.38]  All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet.
[700.38 --> 705.38]  The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Emmanuel,
[705.38 --> 710.38]  which means God with us. Matthew 1, 18-23.
[710.38 --> 738.38]  Oh, the mercy our God has shown to those who sit in death's shadow. The sun on high pierced the night, born was the cornerstone.
[738.38 --> 738.88]  Ginini is born.

[782.64 --> 786.98]  The yoke of sin has been broken
[786.98 --> 792.34]  Once a slave, now but raised
[792.34 --> 796.94]  No more condemnation
[796.94 --> 801.84]  Unto us a son is given
[801.84 --> 806.56]  Unto us a child is born
[806.56 --> 811.28]  He who is mighty has done a great thing
[811.28 --> 816.08]  Taken on flesh and come with good steam
[816.08 --> 820.76]  Shattered the darkness and lifted our shame
[820.76 --> 825.36]  Holy is His name
[825.36 --> 830.66]  Holy is His name
[830.66 --> 837.08]  Now my soul magnifies the Lord
[837.08 --> 838.56]  I rejoice
[838.56 --> 843.16]  In the God who saves I will trust
[843.16 --> 850.76]  His unfailing love I will sing His praise in all my days
[850.76 --> 855.36]  My soul magnifies the Lord
[855.36 --> 861.16]  I rejoice in the God who saves I will trust
[861.16 --> 869.36]  His unfailing love I will sing His praise in all my days
[869.36 --> 873.96]  He who is mighty has done a great thing
[873.96 --> 879.16]  Taken on flesh, conquered death's sting
[879.16 --> 883.36]  Shattered the darkness and lifted our shame
[883.36 --> 887.96]  Holy is His name
[887.96 --> 892.36]  Holy is His name
[892.36 --> 916.34]  Why did this baby need to be born?
[916.76 --> 918.68]  Why is this event so important?
[918.68 --> 921.68]  Why do we wait to celebrate Christ's birthday?
[922.08 --> 923.28]  To answer these questions
[923.28 --> 925.48]  We need to go back to the very beginning
[925.48 --> 930.68]  In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth
[930.68 --> 933.94]  Now the earth was formless and empty
[933.94 --> 936.06]  Darkness was over the surface of the deep
[936.06 --> 938.76]  And the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters
[938.76 --> 941.10]  And God said let there be light
[941.10 --> 942.12]  And there was light
[942.12 --> 944.14]  God saw that the light was good
[944.14 --> 946.22]  And He separated the light from the darkness
[946.22 --> 949.60]  God called the light day
[949.60 --> 951.26]  And the darkness He called night
[951.26 --> 952.54]  And there was evening
[952.54 --> 954.16]  And there was morning the next day
[954.16 --> 957.48]  Then God said
[957.48 --> 959.68]  Let us make mankind in our image
[959.68 --> 960.68]  In our likeness
[960.68 --> 963.20]  So that they may rule over the fish of the sea
[963.20 --> 964.42]  And the birds of the sky
[964.42 --> 967.16]  Over the livestock and all the wild animals
[967.16 --> 969.68]  And over all the creatures that move along the ground
[969.68 --> 999.66]  And the birds of the sea
[999.66 --> 1001.12]  Or they pray
[1001.12 --> 1007.28]  And o'er the fish of the sea
[1007.28 --> 1010.62]  From the mother's sea
[1010.62 --> 1012.00]  From the Switzerland

[1057.06 --> 1087.04]  Thank you.
[1087.06 --> 1117.04]  Thank you.
[1117.06 --> 1130.76]  Through the kisses of a friend's betrayal, he was lifted on a cruel cross.
[1130.76 --> 1136.76]  He was punished for a world's transgressions.
[1137.76 --> 1142.76]  He was suffering to save the lost.
[1142.76 --> 1154.76]  He fights for breath, he fights for me.
[1154.76 --> 1167.14]  Losing sinners from the claims of hell, and with a shout, our souls are free.
[1167.14 --> 1172.14]  Let me be defeated by Emmanuel.
[1172.14 --> 1180.14]  Now who am I?
[1180.14 --> 1182.14]  Let me be defeated by Emmanuel.
[1182.14 --> 1186.14]  Let me be defeated by Emmanuel.
[1187.14 --> 1188.14]  I'm sorry.
[1188.14 --> 1189.14]  Let me be defeated by Emmanuel.
[1189.14 --> 1191.14]  I'm sorry.
[1191.14 --> 1196.14]  To see His love, He lost me by me
[1196.14 --> 1202.14]  To His love and love to be His Lord
[1202.14 --> 1209.14]  To stand His heart and the mountainside
[1209.14 --> 1214.14]  To stand His love and the glory in the name
[1214.14 --> 1220.14]  To stand His love and the true love and the size
[1220.14 --> 1225.14]  Give His glory to the name
[1225.14 --> 1232.14]  And the skies will part as the trumpet sounds
[1232.14 --> 1237.14]  Hope of heaven or the fear of hell
[1237.14 --> 1244.14]  But the pride will run to His love and the love
[1244.14 --> 1249.14]  Giving glory to Emmanuel

[1520.84 --> 1522.84]  Thank you.

[1571.84 --> 1586.36]  The Lord established His nation, yet His people kept turning away from Him.
[1586.94 --> 1590.78]  God Himself was meant to be their ruler, but they demanded an earthly king.
[1590.78 --> 1594.74]  So God gave Him one, a good and faithful king named David.
[1595.12 --> 1600.54]  But as the years went on, many of the kings who followed David led with selfishness and greed.
[1600.98 --> 1606.90]  Israel, God's own kingdom, slipped into indulgence, idolatry, and immorality.
[1609.98 --> 1614.82]  Still the Lord was not finished. He continued moving towards the salvation of His creation.
[1614.92 --> 1622.30]  He sent prophets to call the people back, to encourage them, and to most importantly, to proclaim the Savior that was on His way.
[1624.56 --> 1630.12]  A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse, but from his roots a branch will bear fruit.
[1630.54 --> 1640.74]  The Spirit of the Lord will rest on him, the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the Spirit of counsel and of power, the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord.
[1640.86 --> 1642.72]  And he will delight in the fear of the Lord.
[1644.50 --> 1656.22]  For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders, and he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
[1656.22 --> 1661.62]  A side of the Lord, county wird's treasure, but will be called for nous.

[1989.34 --> 2001.20]  This, this is Christ the King, whom shepherds guard and angels sing.
[2001.20 --> 2013.12]  Haste, haste to bring him blood, the babe, the son of Mary.
[2014.72 --> 2026.24]  What lies he in such cleanest faith, where ox and bass are feeding?
[2026.24 --> 2039.28]  The Christian fear for sinners fear, the silent word is pleading.
[2040.02 --> 2051.06]  Hail, spirit shall pierce him through, the cross be born for me and you.

[2111.88 --> 2113.88]  Amen.
[2131.14 --> 2134.40]  And folding at last.
[2134.88 --> 2139.30]  After countless years of waiting, God's promised savior was ready to be born.
[2139.30 --> 2147.36]  So Joseph went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea to Bethlehem, the town of David,
[2147.58 --> 2152.66]  because he belonged to the house and line of David. He went there to register with Mary,
[2152.80 --> 2157.38]  who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child. While they were there,
[2157.38 --> 2163.32]  the time came for the baby to be born, and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped
[2163.32 --> 2167.76]  him in cloths and placed him in a manger because there was no guest room available for them.
[2169.30 --> 2175.08]  And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night.
[2175.54 --> 2180.84]  An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.
[2181.72 --> 2187.20]  But the angel said to them, Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for
[2187.20 --> 2193.26]  all the people. Today in the town of David, a Savior has been born to you. He is the Messiah,
[2193.26 --> 2199.14]  the Lord. This will be a sign to you. You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.
[2199.30 --> 2207.28]  Suddenly, a great company of the heavenly hosts appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,
[2207.90 --> 2213.08]  Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.
[2213.66 --> 2217.92]  When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another,
[2218.28 --> 2222.82]  Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.
[2222.82 --> 2229.10]  So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and the baby who was lying in the manger.
[2229.60 --> 2234.50]  When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told to them about this child.
[2234.90 --> 2239.00]  And all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds had said to them.
[2239.30 --> 2242.64]  But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.
[2242.64 --> 2248.16]  The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen,
[2248.16 --> 2250.42]  which were just as they had been told.
[2250.42 --> 2279.82]  The shepherdsNS

[2305.38 --> 2315.10]  leading all the mountains, the mistletoe, wise men worships, the King of kings.

[2327.24 --> 2337.02]  be not afraid that news I bring of Christ the Savior, the King of kings.
[2340.64 --> 2349.24]  Hail, King of kings, glory, sing praise to the name, the truth and the story of my holy king.

[2734.90 --> 2736.90]  Thank you.
[2737.80 --> 2746.14]  After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the East came to Jerusalem and asked,
[2746.70 --> 2752.34]  Where is the one who has been born King of the Jews? We saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.
[2752.34 --> 2768.12]  They were told to go and search carefully for the child. And so they went on their way, and the star they had seen when it rose went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.
[2768.12 --> 2770.96]  When they saw the star, they were overjoyed.

[3273.70 --> 3275.02]  The signs are clear.
[3275.28 --> 3278.66]  The star shines in the sky, and the birth of our Savior is come.
[3278.94 --> 3280.74]  And yet, we still wait.
[3280.74 --> 3290.06]  Even though we know that Christ has been born, and that his work is complete, and that his sacrifice is for sure, we still wait to celebrate his second coming.
[3290.60 --> 3293.46]  Today, we look back to fuel our hope for the future.
[3293.46 --> 3296.34]  We wait because, as Revelation tells us,
[3296.34 --> 3300.34]  Behold, I am coming soon.
[3300.60 --> 3304.98]  My reward is with me, and I will give to everyone according to what he has done.

[3502.86 --> 3504.86]  Amen.
[3506.86 --> 3508.86]  Amen.
[3522.86 --> 3526.86]  Why don't you have a seat now?
[3528.86 --> 3532.98]  For those of you who are guests here tonight, my name is Chris.
[3533.22 --> 3536.30]  I'm one of the other pastors here at Langley Emanuel.
[3537.30 --> 3543.18]  And before we close, I just want to recognize something about tonight,
[3543.44 --> 3548.02]  about nights like tonight, and seasons like the one we find ourselves in.
[3550.62 --> 3556.00]  It's dark out there, both literally and figuratively.
[3556.00 --> 3563.00]  At the time of year where the darkness is the longest and the heaviest that it may feel,
[3563.90 --> 3570.26]  and yet here we sing that the light of the world has come into his creation.
[3570.80 --> 3577.86]  That God himself, the one who spoke, let there be light, has come into this world.
[3578.84 --> 3581.46]  Light has pierced the darkness.
[3581.46 --> 3589.58]  And so we have these little lights among us, and you were given a little light on your way in.
[3589.78 --> 3592.94]  In just a moment, we are going to sing our closing song.
[3593.92 --> 3600.76]  And before we sing, we're going to have a few elders come up to the front, elders from our church.
[3600.76 --> 3608.12]  And then Pastor Kevin and I will each light our candles, and then we will pass that light to the elders.
[3608.12 --> 3611.64]  And then the elders will go out and pass that light to you.
[3612.04 --> 3614.28]  And then you pass it down the row.
[3614.48 --> 3618.82]  And in that way, in this moment, the light gets a little bit brighter.
[3619.50 --> 3623.22]  And then as we go, we carry that light with you.
[3623.22 --> 3630.16]  Now, this is also just a symbol, and so when you get to the doors, please blow your candle out and give it to the person who is there.
[3631.64 --> 3634.82]  We don't need flames running around in the foyer afterwards.
[3636.16 --> 3637.98]  But here's what else we know.
[3637.98 --> 3645.76]  Even as we bring light into the darkness, we do so in a particular way and for particular purposes.
[3645.76 --> 3657.04]  I was reflecting with someone this week about a story from the Old Testament, a story of David, before he fights Goliath.
[3658.70 --> 3666.12]  In 1 Samuel 16, he is in the court of Saul, who's being oppressed by an evil spirit.
[3666.72 --> 3672.44]  There's a darkness on him, and David sings, and the spirit flees.
[3672.44 --> 3681.02]  There's something about the church gathering to sing the praises of God that causes the darkness to flee.
[3682.20 --> 3691.52]  There's something about the church that gathers to sing the praises of Jesus who enters the world in this time that causes the devil to tremble.
[3693.20 --> 3695.64]  And that's why we sing in the darkness.
[3696.92 --> 3699.70]  That's why we gather on nights like tonight.
[3699.70 --> 3707.28]  And so, even as you go, go singing the praises of our good God.
[3707.58 --> 3711.06]  Go also with an invitation to continue singing.
[3711.44 --> 3716.12]  Now, if you're a member at another church, we want to encourage you to connect with your churches
[3716.12 --> 3720.16]  and for whatever they're doing over the Christmas season, whether it's Christmas Eve or Christmas Day,
[3720.72 --> 3724.42]  plug in and sing loudly at those gatherings together.
[3724.42 --> 3732.70]  If you're looking for a place to gather on Christmas Day, we will be here at 10 a.m. to sing the glories of our good God.
[3732.84 --> 3734.48]  And we invite you to join us for that.
[3735.44 --> 3739.24]  But before we go, we're going to receive God's blessing.
[3739.96 --> 3741.44]  And so I'm going to invite you to stand.
[3741.44 --> 3749.94]  As you stand, I invite you to take a posture of receipt, knowing that it is God himself who meets us here in this place.
[3750.30 --> 3753.68]  And that as we sing his praises, he fills us with his spirit.
[3753.92 --> 3761.56]  As we stand on his word, he gives us a foundation in and from which to step into whatever comes next.
[3761.56 --> 3764.16]  And he goes with us.
[3764.58 --> 3767.16]  And so receive the blessing of our God.
[3767.24 --> 3772.48]  After the blessing, I'm going to have Pastor Kevin come up and the elders who I spoke to beforehand to come up.
[3772.66 --> 3776.28]  And then once we get the first candles lit, you guys may start us in singing.
[3777.34 --> 3778.40]  The blessing of God.
[3780.68 --> 3783.24]  God go before you to lead you.
[3784.38 --> 3786.84]  God go behind you to protect you.
[3788.00 --> 3790.14]  God go beneath you to support you.
[3790.14 --> 3793.58]  God go beside you to befriend you.
[3794.32 --> 3796.36]  Do not be afraid.
[3797.02 --> 3799.02]  Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[3799.14 --> 3800.60]  Do not be afraid.
[3801.04 --> 3805.60]  But go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
[3806.18 --> 3808.38]  All God's people said, amen.
[3820.40 --> 3823.30]  God, let the blessing of the Lord.
[3823.38 --> 3826.14]  Amen.
[3827.14 --> 3828.36]  Amen.
[3828.60 --> 3829.14]  Amen.
[3829.14 --> 3859.12]  Thank you.
[3859.14 --> 3889.12]  Thank you.
[3889.14 --> 3919.12]  Thank you.
[3919.14 --> 3949.12]  Thank you.
[3949.14 --> 3979.12]  Thank you.
[3979.14 --> 4009.12]  Thank you.
[4009.14 --> 4039.12]  Thank you.
[4039.14 --> 4069.12]  Thank you.
