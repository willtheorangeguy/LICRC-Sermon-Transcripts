[60.00 --> 62.00]  Thank you.
[90.00 --> 92.00]  Thank you.
[120.00 --> 122.00]  Thank you.
[150.00 --> 152.00]  Thank you.
[180.00 --> 188.78]  Praise God, praise God, from whom all blessings flow.
[190.00 --> 198.66]  Praise Him, praise Him for the wonders of His love.
[198.66 --> 208.00]  Praise God, praise God, from whom all blessings flow.
[208.66 --> 218.18]  Praise Him, praise Him, for the wonders of His love.
[218.18 --> 221.18]  Praise God, He's amazing love.
[221.18 --> 226.46]  For God so loved the world that He gave us.
[226.66 --> 228.18]  It's one and all.
[228.18 --> 229.18]  It's one and all.
[229.18 --> 231.18]  It's one and all.
[231.18 --> 232.18]  It's one and all.
[232.18 --> 233.18]  It's one and all.
[233.18 --> 259.26]  It's one and all.
[259.26 --> 262.24]  Freedom for God so loved.
[262.74 --> 265.72]  God so loved the world.
[269.48 --> 272.02]  Bring all your failures.
[272.58 --> 274.32]  Bring your addictions.
[274.32 --> 279.12]  Come lay them down at the foot of the cross.
[279.46 --> 281.54]  Jesus is waiting.
[282.18 --> 285.08]  God so loved the world.
[289.26 --> 319.24]  God so loved the world.
[319.26 --> 321.28]  God so loved the world.
[324.28 --> 325.80]  I am all a Christian.
[327.56 --> 329.18]  I am a Christian.
[330.62 --> 334.40]  Do you 바�os for them?
[334.40 --> 336.44]  They are the sistema.
[336.52 --> 338.56]  They are the same.
[339.14 --> 342.24]  What the flow is that it is to add.
[343.28 --> 345.54]  God so loved the veramente.
[345.54 --> 352.20]  So I throw up my hands and praise you again and again.
[353.34 --> 362.94]  Because all that I have is a hallelujah, hallelujah.
[362.94 --> 370.44]  And I know it's not much, but I've nothing else fit for a king.
[370.44 --> 381.48]  Except for a heart singing hallelujah, hallelujah.
[386.36 --> 389.58]  I've got one response.
[391.74 --> 394.62]  I've got just one move.
[394.62 --> 404.62]  With my arms stretched wide, I will worship you.
[405.62 --> 411.62]  So I throw up my hands and praise you again and again.
[412.62 --> 423.62]  Because all that I have is a hallelujah, hallelujah.
[423.62 --> 430.62]  And I know it's not much, but I've nothing else fit for a king.
[430.62 --> 441.62]  Except for a heart singing hallelujah, hallelujah.
[441.62 --> 443.62]  Hallelujah.
[443.62 --> 445.62]  Hallelujah.
[445.62 --> 466.62]  en-
[466.62 --> 473.00]  Lift up your soul, cause you've got a light inside those lungs.
[473.50 --> 476.38]  Get up and praise the Lord.
[479.92 --> 482.08]  Oh, come on, my soul.
[482.52 --> 485.04]  Oh, don't you get shy on me.
[485.18 --> 491.74]  Lift up your soul, cause you've got a light inside those lungs.
[491.74 --> 495.42]  Get up and praise the Lord.
[496.62 --> 500.64]  Oh, come on, my soul.
[501.04 --> 503.52]  Oh, don't you get shy on me.
[503.68 --> 508.62]  Lift up your soul, cause you've got a light inside those lungs.
[510.06 --> 511.20]  Good morning.
[512.76 --> 514.62]  Welcome to worship.
[515.40 --> 518.34]  A special welcome if you are a guest with us this morning.
[518.52 --> 521.16]  My name is Chris, and I'm one of the pastors here.
[521.16 --> 526.98]  And it's my privilege to lead in our shared worship this morning with these people you
[526.98 --> 530.40]  see on stage and a couple others who will come up at different points.
[531.42 --> 535.72]  Today is the first Sunday of Lent.
[536.26 --> 542.90]  Lent is the season of preparation leading us to Good Friday where we remember and reflect
[542.90 --> 549.10]  upon the death of Jesus in our place and where we anticipate Easter Sunday and his resurrection.
[549.68 --> 551.72]  The season began with Ash Wednesday.
[551.98 --> 558.42]  We had a little service here where we reflected on our sinfulness and our mortality, and we carry
[558.42 --> 563.50]  that reflection and introspection forward in this season of Lent together.
[563.50 --> 568.80]  to mark the remembering Jesus' death until he comes again.
[568.92 --> 573.06]  We're also participating in the supper this morning, and so I encourage you already now,
[573.38 --> 577.64]  begin preparing your heart and your mind to come to this table together later.
[578.10 --> 582.32]  Before we begin our worship in earnest, there's a few announcements to make.
[582.82 --> 585.12]  One of them, I hope, is just a reminder.
[586.00 --> 589.42]  The other two are bits of information for you to follow up on.
[589.42 --> 593.36]  The first bit of information to follow up on is in the foyer over there.
[593.46 --> 597.74]  There's a table marked Lost and Found, and it's covered in things.
[598.62 --> 601.78]  So we would love for it to be less covered by the end of today.
[602.60 --> 606.92]  At some point in the next couple weeks, whatever is left on there is just going to get donated
[606.92 --> 609.96]  to Mission Thrift Store or somewhere.
[610.48 --> 616.26]  And so please have a look, see if your things are there, or probably see if your kids' things
[616.26 --> 620.00]  are there, and maybe you can find something you've been missing for a little while.
[621.18 --> 631.14]  The other note today, tonight at 7 p.m., is HCBC for the youth and the Heidelberg Catechism
[631.14 --> 634.88]  Reading Group for the rest of us to participate in.
[634.96 --> 640.68]  So we're going to gather here at 7 p.m. to continue our studies of the Heidelberg Catechism
[640.68 --> 641.90]  and the Belgic Confession.
[641.90 --> 645.24]  If you have any questions about that, you can talk to myself or Pastor Kevin.
[645.50 --> 647.36]  He will address those for you.
[648.48 --> 652.44]  Lastly, we've been making this announcement for a couple weeks now, but we still have to
[652.44 --> 653.24]  keep making it.
[653.70 --> 659.94]  On March 25th, the Mexico mission team needs some drivers to pick them up from Seattle
[659.94 --> 661.90]  Airport and bring them home.
[662.70 --> 668.42]  March 25th at 5 p.m. is when they need to be picked up at and brought home, and we need
[668.42 --> 670.70]  rides for 18 more people yet.
[672.04 --> 676.30]  18's quite a lot, and so your kid might get left in Seattle unless we figure this out.
[677.04 --> 679.42]  Now, maybe that's what you want, but that's not what we want.
[680.46 --> 685.72]  And so if you are able to do that, please talk to, again, Pastor Kevin or Brandon, who's over
[685.72 --> 686.50]  there in the corner.
[686.66 --> 689.10]  He will happily arrange those things with you.
[689.10 --> 693.80]  I think that's it for our announcements, and so I'm going to invite you as you are able
[693.80 --> 698.96]  to stand, and we'll be ushered into the presence of God together this Lenten season.
[704.64 --> 708.14]  As we come into the presence of God, receive His greeting.
[708.52 --> 712.18]  Following the greeting of God, I invite you to turn to those around you and to welcome them
[712.18 --> 713.94]  into our shared worship together.
[714.38 --> 715.48]  Receive the greeting of God.
[715.48 --> 722.64]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, His Son
[722.64 --> 726.54]  and our Savior, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[727.54 --> 727.86]  Amen.
[745.48 --> 763.82]  People of God, as we enter this season of Lent, let us fix our eyes upon Jesus, the pioneer
[763.82 --> 765.22]  and perfecter of faith.
[765.86 --> 770.70]  For the joy set before Him, He endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the
[770.70 --> 772.30]  right hand of the throne of God.
[772.30 --> 776.18]  Behold, Christ will come again and judge the living and the dead.
[776.64 --> 781.90]  Let us then rejoice, because of His great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made
[781.90 --> 785.16]  us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions.
[785.88 --> 789.52]  Give thanks to the Lord, who is good, whose mercy endures forever.
[789.52 --> 816.58]  All the creation, all the fear, made straight a highway back for the Lord.
[816.58 --> 818.58]  Jesus is coming soon.
[818.58 --> 822.58]  Jesus is coming soon.
[822.58 --> 829.82]  Come, every sinner, wake up the saint.
[830.26 --> 834.58]  Let every nation shout your faith.
[834.58 --> 840.58]  Jesus is coming soon.
[840.58 --> 842.58]  Jesus is coming soon.
[842.58 --> 843.58]  Jesus is coming soon.
[843.58 --> 848.58]  Like a cry, waiting for a broom.
[848.58 --> 855.00]  We'll be a church ready for every heart.
[855.00 --> 860.58]  Longing for our King, we sing.
[860.58 --> 867.58]  Give us so loud, Lord Jesus come.
[867.58 --> 874.58]  Give us so loud, Lord Jesus come.
[874.58 --> 883.58]  There will be justice, all will be you.
[883.58 --> 888.58]  Your name forever, faithful and true.
[888.58 --> 889.58]  Jesus is coming soon.
[889.58 --> 890.58]  Jesus is coming soon.
[890.58 --> 895.58]  Jesus is coming soon.
[895.58 --> 903.58]  Like a cry, waiting for a broom.
[903.58 --> 909.58]  We'll be a church ready for you every heart.
[909.58 --> 914.58]  Longing for our King, we sing.
[914.58 --> 924.58]  Give us so loud, Lord Jesus come.
[924.58 --> 930.58]  Give us so loud, Lord Jesus come.
[930.58 --> 931.58]  God, we wait for you.
[931.58 --> 933.58]  Come, we wait.
[933.58 --> 936.58]  You are coming soon.
[936.58 --> 938.58]  God, we wait.
[938.58 --> 944.58]  You are coming soon.
[944.58 --> 947.58]  God, we wait.
[947.58 --> 950.58]  We wait for you.
[950.58 --> 958.34]  So we wait, we wait for you.
[960.82 --> 968.10]  We wait, you're coming soon.
[970.60 --> 974.52]  Like a rising dawn,
[974.52 --> 977.52]  In the end,
[978.02 --> 980.98]  Reckoning to every heart,
[980.98 --> 984.30]  Calling for our King,
[984.68 --> 986.34]  We sing.
[988.04 --> 992.00]  Like a rising dawn,
[993.40 --> 995.24]  In the end,
[995.74 --> 998.68]  Reckoning to every heart,
[999.06 --> 1002.02]  Calling for our King,
[1002.38 --> 1004.04]  We sing.
[1004.52 --> 1007.14]  He will so come,
[1007.70 --> 1011.48]  For Jesus come.
[1013.48 --> 1016.06]  He will so come,
[1016.06 --> 1020.62]  For Jesus come.
[1022.32 --> 1025.48]  He will so come,
[1025.78 --> 1030.06]  For Jesus come.
[1030.06 --> 1031.18]  He will so come,
[1031.18 --> 1031.68]  For Jesus come.
[1031.68 --> 1035.18]  He will so come,
[1035.18 --> 1035.68]  For Jesus come.
[1035.68 --> 1038.14]  For Jesus come.
[1038.14 --> 1043.22]  He is yang to come,
[1043.22 --> 1047.42]  For Jesus come.
[1047.42 --> 1048.14]  And he must go.
[1048.14 --> 1048.44]  He is to come.
[1049.16 --> 1050.06]  He will so come.
[1050.06 --> 1052.28]  He will so come.
[1052.98 --> 1055.22]  And have a chance to center this evening.
[1055.22 --> 1056.72]  The Father himself may shall come,
[1056.72 --> 1065.62]  To the riders we pray upon the Lord, we obey upon the Lord, we obey upon the Lord, Lord God.
[1065.62 --> 1077.62]  We pray forever, come on, our strong deliverer.
[1077.62 --> 1093.20]  You are the everlasting God, the everlasting God, to the faith you won't go away.
[1093.20 --> 1106.06]  You're the defender of the will, you've conquered those who live, you've lifted us up on the way.
[1106.06 --> 1109.44]  You're the everlasting God.
[1117.44 --> 1123.44]  We pray forever, come on, our strong deliverer.
[1123.44 --> 1128.44]  We pray forever, come on, our strong deliverer.
[1128.44 --> 1134.44]  We pray forever, come on, our strong deliverer.
[1134.44 --> 1145.82]  We pray forever, come on, our strong deliverer.
[1145.82 --> 1160.20]  You are the everlasting God, the everlasting God, to do my things you won't go away.
[1160.20 --> 1161.20]  We pray forever, come on, our strong deliverer.
[1161.20 --> 1173.58]  You're the defender of the will, you've conquered those who live, you've lifted us up on the way.
[1173.58 --> 1174.58]  Be forever, come on, our strong deliverer.
[1174.58 --> 1185.20]  You're the everlasting God, the everlasting God.
[1185.26 --> 1191.64]  You do not wait to walk, nor weary.
[1191.64 --> 1221.62]  you're the defender of the
[1221.64 --> 1223.64]  way upon the moon
[1223.64 --> 1237.32]  Our God reigns forever. He is our hope,
[1237.58 --> 1239.52]  our strong deliverer. May he
[1239.52 --> 1241.64]  strengthen us to name that which
[1241.64 --> 1242.84]  we need deliverance from.
[1243.42 --> 1245.28]  For if we claim to be without sin,
[1245.58 --> 1247.48]  we deceive ourselves, and the truth
[1247.48 --> 1249.62]  is not in us. But if we confess
[1249.62 --> 1251.34]  our sins, he is faithful
[1251.34 --> 1253.46]  and just, and will forgive us our
[1253.46 --> 1255.62]  sins and purify us from all
[1255.62 --> 1256.50]  unrighteousness.
[1256.50 --> 1260.14]  O'er our sea?
[1260.14 --> 1287.14] ixoam file
[1290.14 --> 1293.80]  Hear my desperation
[1293.80 --> 1299.18]  For so long I've planned and prayed
[1299.18 --> 1303.00]  God, don't you, I rest you
[1303.00 --> 1307.52]  Even so, the Lord remains
[1307.52 --> 1311.38]  So my heart will praise you
[1311.38 --> 1318.84]  Songs within the trouble so
[1318.84 --> 1323.40]  Questions without answers
[1323.40 --> 1327.56]  Unlike me, these heroes roll
[1327.56 --> 1331.20]  God, we know our shelter
[1331.20 --> 1335.74]  Why are you blessed on my soul?
[1335.74 --> 1339.90]  I'll be able to say to
[1339.90 --> 1344.56]  The Christ of all the hope
[1344.56 --> 1348.54]  Songs in such a great feeling
[1348.54 --> 1356.72]  Oh my soul, put your hope in God
[1356.72 --> 1363.36]  My help, my love, I will praise you
[1363.36 --> 1369.88]  Sing, oh sing, through the raging storm
[1369.88 --> 1374.54]  You're still my God, my salvation
[1374.54 --> 1392.60]  Should my life be torn from me
[1392.60 --> 1396.20]  Every worldly pleasure
[1396.20 --> 1400.86]  When all I possess is free
[1400.86 --> 1404.64]  God, be then my treasure
[1404.64 --> 1409.58]  Be my vision in the night
[1409.58 --> 1412.94]  Be my hope and refuge
[1412.94 --> 1417.68]  Till my faith is turned to sight
[1417.68 --> 1421.36]  Lord, my heart will praise you
[1421.36 --> 1429.02]  Oh my soul, put your hope in God
[1429.02 --> 1433.68]  My help, my God, my help, my God
[1433.68 --> 1435.68]  My help, my God, my salvation
[1435.68 --> 1438.02]  Sing, oh sing, through the raging storm
[1438.02 --> 1442.02]  Sing, oh sing, through the raging storm
[1442.02 --> 1447.68]  You're still my God, my salvation
[1447.68 --> 1448.68]  Oh my God, my salvation
[1448.68 --> 1453.34]  Oh my soul, put your hope in God
[1453.34 --> 1455.34]  Oh my soul, put your hope in God
[1455.34 --> 1458.34]  My help, my God, my help, my God
[1458.34 --> 1461.34]  I will praise you
[1461.34 --> 1468.34]  Sing, oh sing, through the raging storm
[1468.34 --> 1473.00]  You're still my God
[1473.00 --> 1476.00]  You're still my God, my salvation
[1476.00 --> 1498.48]  Brothers and sisters in Christ
[1498.48 --> 1500.98]  Let us confess our sins to each other
[1500.98 --> 1502.42]  And pray for one another
[1502.42 --> 1504.24]  So that we may be healed
[1504.24 --> 1506.98]  For the prayer of a righteous person
[1506.98 --> 1508.74]  Is powerful and effective
[1508.74 --> 1512.60]  Holy and merciful God
[1512.60 --> 1515.72]  We confess to you and to my love
[1515.72 --> 1518.76]  And to the whole communion of saints
[1518.76 --> 1520.34]  In heaven and of earth
[1520.34 --> 1523.40]  That we have sinned by our own fault
[1523.40 --> 1525.88]  In thought, word, and deed
[1525.88 --> 1527.90]  That what we have done
[1527.90 --> 1530.32]  And that I will be left undone
[1530.32 --> 1532.68]  We have not loved you
[1532.68 --> 1534.86]  With our whole heart and mind and strength
[1534.86 --> 1537.26]  We have not loved our neighbors as ourselves
[1537.26 --> 1539.18]  We have not forgiven others
[1539.18 --> 1540.62]  As we have been forgiven
[1540.62 --> 1544.10]  Have mercy on us, O God
[1544.10 --> 1548.44]  We have not listened to your call to serve as Christ served us
[1548.44 --> 1550.98]  We have not been true to the mind of Christ
[1550.98 --> 1553.24]  We have grieved your Holy Spirit
[1553.24 --> 1556.36]  Have mercy on us, O God
[1556.36 --> 1559.10]  We confess to you, O God
[1559.10 --> 1559.22]  We confess to you, O God
[1559.22 --> 1561.16]  All our past unfaithfulness
[1561.16 --> 1565.32]  Pride, hypocrisy, and impatience in our lives
[1565.32 --> 1568.94]  We confess to you, O God
[1568.94 --> 1571.96]  Our self-indulgent appetites and ways
[1571.96 --> 1573.82]  And our expectation of other people
[1573.82 --> 1577.40]  We confess to you, O God
[1577.40 --> 1580.70]  Our anger and our own frustration
[1580.70 --> 1584.10]  And our envy of those more fortunate than ourselves
[1584.10 --> 1587.18]  We confess to you, O God
[1587.18 --> 1590.96]  Our intemperate love of worldly goods and comforts
[1590.96 --> 1593.26]  And our dishonesty in daily life and work
[1593.26 --> 1596.54]  We confess to you, O God
[1596.54 --> 1599.14]  Our negligence in prayer and worship
[1599.14 --> 1602.18]  And our failure to commend the faith that is in us
[1602.18 --> 1605.24]  We confess to you, O God
[1605.24 --> 1608.24]  Accept our repentance, O God
[1608.24 --> 1610.06]  For the wrongs we have done
[1610.06 --> 1612.90]  For our neglect of human need and suffering
[1612.90 --> 1615.66]  And our indifference to injustice and cruelty
[1615.66 --> 1619.46]  Accept our repentance, O God
[1619.46 --> 1621.60]  For all false judgments
[1621.60 --> 1624.22]  For uncharitable thoughts towards our neighbors
[1624.22 --> 1628.26]  And for our prejudice and contempt towards those who differ from us
[1628.26 --> 1631.78]  Accept our repentance, O God
[1631.78 --> 1634.00]  For not trusting in you
[1634.00 --> 1637.22]  For turning to other people and things for our hope
[1637.22 --> 1638.56]  And for living in fear
[1638.56 --> 1641.48]  Blind and deaf to the truth of your word
[1641.48 --> 1644.48]  And the call to live faithful lives to your glory
[1644.48 --> 1647.84]  Accept our repentance, O God
[1647.84 --> 1649.98]  Restore us, O God
[1649.98 --> 1652.68]  And let your anger depart from us
[1652.68 --> 1654.68]  Favorably hear us, O God
[1654.68 --> 1656.36]  For your mercy is great
[1656.36 --> 1657.22]  Amen
[1657.22 --> 1661.22]  Please rise as we respond
[1661.22 --> 1662.16]  To the song
[1662.16 --> 1671.54]  Praise the Lord
[1671.54 --> 1675.10]  His mercy is full
[1675.10 --> 1679.54]  Praise the Lord
[1679.54 --> 1680.38]  His mercy is full

[1683.54 --> 1685.16]  His mercy is full
[1685.16 --> 1686.00]  His mercy is full

[1691.96 --> 1694.60]  Stronger the darkness
[1694.60 --> 1695.72]  Due and behold
[1695.72 --> 1698.28]  Our sins
[1698.28 --> 1699.28]  They are made
[1699.28 --> 1700.10]  His mercy is full
[1700.10 --> 1702.08]  His mercy is full
[1702.08 --> 1704.08]  My mercy is full
[1704.08 --> 1715.78]  What love could remember no wrongs we have done
[1715.78 --> 1720.78]  Conditioned all knowing he cast on their sons
[1720.78 --> 1725.92]  Thrown into a sea without bottom or shore
[1725.92 --> 1732.08]  Our sins they are many, his mercy is full
[1732.08 --> 1745.52]  What patience would wait as we constantly roam
[1745.52 --> 1750.48]  What love is so tender, is calling us whole
[1750.48 --> 1756.18]  He welcomes the weakest, the vilest, the poor
[1756.18 --> 1761.68]  Our sins they are many, his mercy is full
[1761.68 --> 1769.76]  Praise the Lord, his mercy is full

[1777.38 --> 1782.56]  Our sins they are many, his mercy is full
[1782.56 --> 1796.00]  What riches of kindness he lavished on us
[1796.00 --> 1801.10]  His blood was the payment, his blood was the cost
[1801.10 --> 1807.18]  We soon need the debt we could never afford
[1807.18 --> 1812.50]  Our sins they are many, his mercy is full
[1812.50 --> 1820.32]  Praise the Lord, his mercy is full

[1841.40 --> 1847.48]  Stronger and darker, still and poor
[1847.48 --> 1851.48]  Our sins they are many, his mercy is full
[1851.48 --> 1854.52]  Our sins they are many, his mercy is full
[1854.52 --> 1862.60]  Our grace is full
[1862.60 --> 1883.68]  Good morning, my name is Yap, I'm a deacon here at Langley Emanuel
[1883.68 --> 1887.52]  This morning's offering is for Cascade Christian Counseling
[1887.52 --> 1894.46]  Cascade Christian Counseling is a non-profit organization that has been in operation for over 40 years
[1894.46 --> 1899.70]  With a mission to provide Christian counseling and consulting services to the whole community
[1899.70 --> 1906.44]  In order to do that they raise funds in order to provide lower session fees to those who cannot afford to get the help they need
[1906.44 --> 1915.78]  Please give as you're able to and if you want to give to the general budget or any other mission or ministry you can use the envelopes in your seats in front of you
[1915.78 --> 1917.06]  Thank you
[1936.44 --> 1949.12]  Thank you
[1949.12 --> 1979.10]  Thank you.
[1979.12 --> 2009.10]  Thank you.
[2009.12 --> 2039.10]  Thank you.
[2039.12 --> 2069.10]  Thank you.
[2069.12 --> 2071.12]  Thank you.
[2100.08 --> 2101.12]  Thank you.
[2101.54 --> 2102.92]  We're not quite twins.
[2103.94 --> 2104.68]  Any guesses?
[2104.82 --> 2105.94]  Who is one of my family members?
[2108.04 --> 2108.38]  Ooh.
[2109.68 --> 2111.10]  Did we stump you guys?
[2111.18 --> 2111.84]  What do you think, Haley?
[2111.84 --> 2115.22]  You think Matthias is one of my family members?
[2115.38 --> 2116.48]  Oh, he could be.
[2116.84 --> 2117.02]  Yeah?
[2117.56 --> 2119.12]  Do you think Jared and I are brothers, maybe?
[2119.80 --> 2121.10]  We look a little bit similar.
[2122.44 --> 2124.42]  Well, yeah.
[2126.10 --> 2128.30]  That's perhaps more of a compliment to myself.
[2129.28 --> 2129.72]  No?
[2129.90 --> 2131.08]  Are we brothers, do you think?
[2131.96 --> 2133.46]  But me and Matthias maybe are brothers?
[2134.60 --> 2136.88]  Maybe Mr. Kevin and I are brothers?
[2137.78 --> 2138.08]  No?
[2138.08 --> 2138.20]  No.
[2138.48 --> 2139.22]  Oh, there it's like, oh.
[2139.22 --> 2142.00]  Maybe Miss Nikki is my sister?
[2142.56 --> 2143.00]  No?
[2143.94 --> 2144.64]  Oh, boy.
[2144.72 --> 2148.04]  We're moving into the book of Mark, and there's a big theme in Mark.
[2148.10 --> 2148.60]  What do you think?
[2149.96 --> 2150.36]  Oh.
[2151.56 --> 2152.68]  Yes, there we go.
[2152.76 --> 2154.06]  I knew someone would nail it.
[2154.32 --> 2156.78]  We're all brothers and sisters in Christ.
[2157.12 --> 2159.08]  Now, that wasn't meant to be a trick question,
[2159.48 --> 2164.86]  but it is the big theme that we're going to talk about now that we move into the book of Mark.
[2164.86 --> 2165.42]  Okay?
[2165.86 --> 2169.06]  So, thank you very much, helpers, for the illustration.
[2170.08 --> 2170.44]  All right.
[2170.60 --> 2175.52]  Why don't we stand and we'll bless the congregation as they stay and hear our message here,
[2175.58 --> 2180.08]  and we're going to hear more about the family of God in children's worship time.
[2180.88 --> 2181.32]  Ready?
[2181.40 --> 2182.20]  Let's give the blessing.
[2183.22 --> 2185.04]  The Lord be with you.
[2185.30 --> 2186.86]  And also with you.
[2187.22 --> 2187.94]  Come and eat.
[2187.94 --> 2188.06]  Come and eat.
[2199.22 --> 2203.40]  Lord, our Lord, your glorious name.
[2203.40 --> 2203.84]  Amen.
[2207.84 --> 2221.04] amientoelduff
[2221.04 --> 2232.04]  Lord, our Lord, your glorious name in all your wondrous works proclaim.
[2233.54 --> 2238.90]  In the heavens with the radiant signs, evermore your glory shines.
[2239.98 --> 2241.86]  How great is your name.
[2243.48 --> 2247.94]  Lord, our Lord, in all the earth, how great is your name.
[2247.94 --> 2255.46]  Yours is the name of matchless worth, excellent in all the earth.
[2256.52 --> 2258.66]  How great is your name.
[2261.00 --> 2265.56]  We gather in your name this morning to bring you our prayers,
[2266.16 --> 2269.50]  to sing your praises and to hear and study your word.
[2270.96 --> 2276.20]  Thank you for this day, for bringing us all here.
[2276.20 --> 2280.76]  Your people into a preview of your kingdom,
[2281.62 --> 2284.68]  for giving us this foretaste of glory divine.
[2286.22 --> 2290.60]  We know we cannot truly understand the nature of your kingdom,
[2291.28 --> 2297.54]  but we do know that it is wonderful and glorious beyond all belief.
[2297.54 --> 2306.02]  As we wait, we are mindful at this time of our task here on earth.
[2306.02 --> 2309.78]  You did not create us to be idle.
[2311.16 --> 2314.64]  You gave us dominion and responsibility over creation,
[2314.64 --> 2320.78]  and we ask that you give us what we need for this task of developing and caring for creation.
[2320.78 --> 2334.96]  Fill our hearts with your spirit so that we do our daily work and help us to keep that in mind in all that we do is for you, Lord.
[2336.06 --> 2339.92]  Raise up the church to do deeds of faith and generosity.
[2339.92 --> 2347.54]  We pray for our nation and its leaders that they would follow after justice and righteousness.
[2348.92 --> 2350.82]  We pray for your church.
[2352.32 --> 2358.92]  Grant our leaders your wisdom and discernment, strength for the day and faith in troubled times.
[2358.92 --> 2367.78]  We pray for the ongoing ministries here at Emmanuel that they may help us to grow in faith and love.
[2369.10 --> 2376.64]  We pray that we would all grow into the grace and knowledge of Jesus, doing good works to his glory.
[2376.64 --> 2386.30]  We thank you that Michaela Chamberlain and Kate and Abby recently got engaged.
[2386.82 --> 2390.06]  We pray that you will continue to bless their relationship.
[2392.44 --> 2397.48]  We give thanks that Anne-Marie Van Mayen's heart surgery went well,
[2397.98 --> 2400.96]  and we ask that you will give her a smooth recovery.
[2400.96 --> 2409.38]  We pray for Lena that she will regain her physical strength so that she can go home.
[2411.14 --> 2415.22]  We pray for your healing and sustaining peace for John Finbergite.
[2417.56 --> 2422.32]  We pray for Jerry Jansen's daughter and Anikala's sister, Tessa.
[2423.88 --> 2427.78]  We ask for Tessa to be given strength as she undergoes chemotherapy.
[2430.96 --> 2438.56]  We ask also that you pray for Elise Wagener's dad, Doug Kendon, and Tessa Tessemacher.
[2440.30 --> 2443.70]  Amanda, Hohuwoning's sister, and Klaus Tessemacher's daughter.
[2444.46 --> 2451.22]  We ask for you to give effective treatment and courage to face this journey.
[2452.22 --> 2457.22]  And we pray for the families involved as they need strength to walk beside their loved ones.
[2457.22 --> 2465.68]  Lord, we hear of many people with cancer, and we ask for your healing and strength.
[2469.64 --> 2474.16]  Lord, as we hear your will for us this morning through the word preached by Pastor Chris,
[2475.16 --> 2477.06]  bind us together in Christ.
[2478.22 --> 2480.24]  Keep us focused on our purpose.
[2481.70 --> 2483.30]  Fill us with the Holy Spirit.
[2483.30 --> 2492.16]  We pray that we will grow in love and truth, righteousness and peace, hope and faith.
[2493.64 --> 2497.70]  Mature us in Jesus that we may become more and more like him.
[2499.36 --> 2505.16]  Fulfill your will and purposes among us, and bring glory to your holy name.
[2506.26 --> 2510.46]  All these things we pray in your holy name.
[2511.24 --> 2511.50]  Amen.
[2513.30 --> 2542.36]  Here at Emmanuel, we are reading together through the books of 1 and 2 Thessalonians.
[2542.36 --> 2546.52]  Paul's letter written to the church of Thessalonica.
[2547.66 --> 2552.06]  This morning, we come to chapter 4, verse 13 to 18.
[2552.22 --> 2554.86]  We're going to read that together beforehand,
[2555.32 --> 2558.58]  and then we'll spend some time reflecting on that.
[2558.58 --> 2558.64]  Amen.
[2558.64 --> 2558.70]  Amen.
[2558.70 --> 2558.78]  Amen.
[2558.78 --> 2559.14]  Amen.
[2559.14 --> 2559.20]  Amen.
[2559.20 --> 2559.58]  Amen.
[2559.58 --> 2560.70]  Amen.
[2560.70 --> 2561.14]  Amen.
[2561.14 --> 2561.64]  Amen.
[2561.64 --> 2561.70]  Amen.
[2561.70 --> 2562.14]  Amen.
[2562.14 --> 2562.70]  Amen.
[2562.70 --> 2562.80]  Amen.
[2562.80 --> 2563.58]  Amen.
[2563.58 --> 2564.20]  Amen.
[2564.20 --> 2564.70]  Amen.
[2564.70 --> 2564.80]  Amen.
[2564.80 --> 2565.70]  Amen.
[2565.70 --> 2566.70]  Amen.
[2566.70 --> 2566.80]  Amen.
[2566.80 --> 2567.80]  Amen.
[2567.80 --> 2568.80]  Amen.
[2568.80 --> 2568.86]  Amen.
[2568.86 --> 2569.80]  Amen.
[2569.80 --> 2570.80]  Amen.
[2570.80 --> 2571.80]  Amen.
[2571.80 --> 2572.36]  Amen.
[2572.80 --> 2577.54]  Amen.
[2577.54 --> 2577.62]  Amen.
[2582.02 --> 2591.82]  Amen.
[2591.82 --> 2592.02]  Amen.
[2592.02 --> 2592.80]  Amen.
[2592.80 --> 2593.68]  Amen.
[2593.68 --> 2602.12]  understand and approach even the tragedy and hardship of death. For that, we look here in
[2602.12 --> 2608.70]  1 Thessalonians 4. I'm going to start reading in chapter, or in verse 13, and we'll read through to
[2608.70 --> 2612.32]  the end of verse 18, which is the end of this chapter.
[2614.62 --> 2621.58]  Brothers and sisters, we do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death,
[2621.58 --> 2629.24]  so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind who have no hope. For we believe that Jesus died
[2629.24 --> 2637.70]  and rose again, and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in
[2637.70 --> 2645.12]  him. According to the Lord's word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left until the
[2645.12 --> 2652.16]  coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will
[2652.16 --> 2657.50]  come down from heaven with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet call
[2657.50 --> 2665.80]  of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left
[2665.80 --> 2670.82]  will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air,
[2670.82 --> 2680.26]  and so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore, encourage one another with these words.
[2680.92 --> 2682.36]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2686.46 --> 2696.56]  I've said before to you that good theology, properly taught, properly applied, is practical
[2696.56 --> 2710.04]  theology. Good theology is practical theology. In the face of hardship and suffering, in the face of
[2710.04 --> 2720.94]  challenge and trial, understanding a word about God can bring encouragement and hope. This text,
[2720.94 --> 2729.24]  like the story referenced in the comic over my shoulder, this text is an excellent example of what I mean.
[2730.74 --> 2737.54]  To whet your appetite, to see where we're going, notice this. We read in verse 17 together,
[2738.34 --> 2745.14]  after that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds
[2745.14 --> 2755.62]  to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will be with the Lord forever. That word, caught up in Greek,
[2756.16 --> 2766.16]  is a form of harpazo, which when translated from Greek into Latin in the fourth century by Jerome,
[2766.72 --> 2774.42]  becomes a form of the word rapio, which is where we get the English word rapture.
[2775.14 --> 2781.68]  From. And so if you've been around Christian circles in the 20th or 21st century for any amount
[2781.68 --> 2788.00]  of time, you've probably heard the word rapture. You've probably heard people talk about a secret
[2788.00 --> 2793.10]  rapture wherein the bodies of all who believe will vanish and their clothes will be left in a nice
[2793.10 --> 2801.04]  folded pile on their airplane seat as everyone around them screams. This idea of a secret rapture
[2801.04 --> 2810.46]  was first taught by a man named John Nelson Darby in the 19th century, and it's part of what many have
[2810.46 --> 2816.56]  come to call a pre-millennial dispensational approach to theology, where Jesus will come in secret,
[2817.02 --> 2824.04]  where he will collect all Christians in order to escape a period of tribulation that will take place
[2824.04 --> 2833.26]  before the full, visible, and final return of Christ. The question of theology asks, is that true?
[2834.26 --> 2841.64]  Is that what this text is actually teaching? Is that good theology? And does it help us?
[2841.64 --> 2849.68]  Because remember, good theology is practical theology. What I want to suggest this morning,
[2850.40 --> 2857.94]  and the sort of banner under which we will labor together in this text, is that what we hear here
[2857.94 --> 2869.44]  is a real hope because of a real end, a real telos, a purpose for the world. And to get to that, to see
[2869.44 --> 2877.68]  this real hope because of a real end for our real world, I want to start by taking the beginning and
[2877.68 --> 2884.76]  the end of this text and looking at them together. So verse 13 and verse 18. At the beginning, Paul writes,
[2884.76 --> 2892.44]  brothers and sisters, we do not want you to be uninformed. Now what he literally says there in
[2892.44 --> 2898.84]  Greek in the original language is, we do not want you not to know. And the editors have made it
[2898.84 --> 2905.00]  uninformed because not want you not to know is a confusing sentence structure in English. It's hard
[2905.00 --> 2911.56]  to follow along. But effectively, what Paul is saying is, hey, there's something we really want you to
[2911.56 --> 2918.54]  know. We wish you would understand this. Think about this with me for a minute. We don't want you
[2918.54 --> 2925.96]  not to know. He's saying, don't miss this truth. Paul wants his readers and he wants us to know
[2925.96 --> 2932.32]  something, to be aware of some truth, to have an idea or a thought or a formulation in our head,
[2932.32 --> 2942.62]  to have words at the ready. To be sure, what he wants us to know is something about God, words about God.
[2943.36 --> 2954.40]  In its simplest definition, that's what theology is, words about God. Theology is to have and speak
[2954.40 --> 2966.14]  and know words about God. And Paul here wants us to have a word about God. We need to know. He says,
[2966.26 --> 2973.34]  I do not want you not to know. I do not want you to be uninformed. Know these things, have words about
[2973.34 --> 2983.32]  these things, have good theology. And then at the end of our text, verse 18, he says, therefore,
[2983.76 --> 2990.84]  encourage one another with these words. Right? There are things I want you to know, things I want
[2990.84 --> 2998.64]  you to study and to trust and believe. And when you know them, when you study them, when you trust them,
[2998.64 --> 3007.82]  you will be encouraged. Good theology is practical. Good theology is for encouragement. And in particular,
[3008.10 --> 3017.10]  in this moment, Paul wants his readers to be comforted in the face of a great trial and hardship
[3017.10 --> 3026.56]  we call death. We do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death. So you do not grieve
[3026.56 --> 3034.94]  like the rest of mankind who have no hope. Good theology is hopeful. Good theology is practical.
[3035.40 --> 3043.92]  Good theology is encouraging. And when it comes to death, good theology reframes the whole thing for us.
[3045.60 --> 3049.84]  Kevin Van Hooser is a modern theologian. He says,
[3049.84 --> 3057.62]  knowing the ending turns what might be otherwise a tragedy into a divine comedy.
[3059.08 --> 3064.94]  And that doesn't mean it's a joke. It means that at the end, all things are put right.
[3067.76 --> 3076.34]  So the question that we face this morning isn't, will I die? The question isn't, when will I die?
[3076.34 --> 3084.86]  The question isn't even, what will cause my death? Instead, the question is, how will I die? How will I
[3084.86 --> 3091.86]  approach death? How will I think about death? How will I face death? How will I have hope? How will I
[3091.86 --> 3101.50]  overcome? How will I be encouraged? How will I have courage? Or will I be afraid? Will I have peace in the
[3101.50 --> 3109.56]  face? Or will I be cast about? When I die? Or when someone I love dies? How will I be?
[3111.56 --> 3118.40]  Part of being a disciple, as we enter this season of Lent reflecting on death and our mortality,
[3118.98 --> 3125.18]  part of being a disciple of Jesus is having a different approach to death, even in this life
[3125.18 --> 3132.22]  and in this world. And what is the practical impact that's flowing from the truth that in Jesus,
[3132.48 --> 3140.36]  death is defeated and has lost its sting? This is a uniquely Christian new reality.
[3141.56 --> 3149.72]  Do not grieve, we read, like the rest of mankind who have no hope. And that actually is an idea,
[3149.72 --> 3155.46]  right? Grieving that comparison to the rest of mankind. It's an idea that ties back to the
[3155.46 --> 3162.72]  preceding section. We looked at it before, last time, in verse 11 and 12, we read,
[3163.24 --> 3169.64]  make it your ambition to lead a quiet life. You should mind your own business and work with your
[3169.64 --> 3177.68]  hands just as we told you, so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders. If the rest of
[3177.68 --> 3184.90]  mankind and the respect of outsiders, and in both cases, we are encouraged to live and to conduct
[3184.90 --> 3192.28]  ourselves in life in a way that is genuinely Christian, genuinely distinct from the culture
[3192.28 --> 3198.08]  around us, a way that is genuinely consistent with the message of the gospel and the teachings
[3198.08 --> 3205.86]  of God in Jesus Christ. And as Christians then, what can we know about God in the face of death,
[3205.86 --> 3213.16]  and how can that bring us comfort? As Christians, what can we know about God in the face of God in
[3213.16 --> 3220.22]  death, in the face of death, that our daily living, and even if we face it ourselves, that even our death
[3220.22 --> 3231.24]  may in fact win the respect of outsiders. Death is one thing that unites us all. And so,
[3231.24 --> 3239.44]  a word about God, a theology of death is eminently practical and useful.
[3243.04 --> 3253.06]  In the ancient world, and for many today, death is simply an end. And so, for these Christians
[3253.06 --> 3261.16]  in Thessalonica, many of whom are new to faith, these new Christians, these people who've
[3261.16 --> 3268.58]  just been converted to Christianity are still learning how to reframe their experience of life
[3268.58 --> 3274.72]  by the teachings of the gospel and by the word, right? And so, the ideas that they have about death
[3274.72 --> 3282.00]  are going to have some of the vestiges of the culture's teaching within it. And in the culture of
[3282.00 --> 3290.30]  the day, death is generally associated with a lack of hope. There are some examples of great heroes
[3290.30 --> 3296.98]  who are taken up into Elysium and who experience peace and celebration. But for the most people,
[3297.08 --> 3304.04]  for the average person in the ancient world, death is just an end. It is formless and void. It is lonely
[3304.04 --> 3313.74]  wandering. Catalyst, who's a contemporary of Paul, he writes in one of his poems,
[3313.74 --> 3323.14]  the sun can set and rise again, but once our brief light sets, there is one unending night to be slept
[3323.14 --> 3333.74]  through. Similarly, Theocritus, who is a Greek philosopher, he writes, hopes are for the living,
[3333.74 --> 3345.10]  the dead are without hope. And these are the kinds of ideas that surround death for the people of
[3345.10 --> 3353.14]  Thessalonica. These new Christians have to wonder what changes. What will happen to me at death? Do I
[3353.14 --> 3358.82]  have hope? And if I die before Jesus returns, will I miss out on what's going to happen? What happens if I
[3358.82 --> 3366.68]  die before He returns? The church at Thessalonica is relearning a whole new theology of death because of
[3366.68 --> 3375.14]  their faith, and Pastor Paul is teaching good theology to them. And so what I want to do for the time
[3375.14 --> 3387.08]  that remains to us this morning is look at six points of practical application as we face death
[3387.08 --> 3396.20]  from this text. First of all, point number one, death isn't the end, it is a transition.
[3397.72 --> 3404.54]  This is verse 14, if you will follow along with me. Verse 14, for we believe that Jesus died and rose
[3404.54 --> 3414.36]  again, and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in Him.
[3414.36 --> 3423.50]  Jesus' resurrection is offered as a guarantee of a future resurrection for all who will believe.
[3424.56 --> 3434.30]  Because Jesus rose, God will raise you up if you died in Christ. This is how the gospel becomes
[3434.30 --> 3440.90]  good news for you. Jesus lived the life I should have lived and died the death that I deserved,
[3440.90 --> 3449.02]  and on the third day He rose again from the dead. He died in order to defeat death. And if you are united
[3449.02 --> 3454.72]  to Him in His death, you will be united to Him in a resurrection like His. This is the promise of God
[3454.72 --> 3463.52]  and of the gospel. Death isn't the end, it's a transition. And what we see is that if death isn't the end,
[3463.52 --> 3473.12]  there must be a new one. That new end is the resurrection of all, the return and the reign of Jesus Christ.
[3473.70 --> 3480.60]  That's the end of history. That's the goal of it all. The resurrection of all, the return and the reign
[3480.60 --> 3490.94]  of Jesus. Death isn't the end. Number two, what do we see? We see that those who die go to be with
[3490.94 --> 3499.96]  Jesus. Again in verse 14, we read, God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in Him.
[3501.40 --> 3509.20]  Here we read that those who have died are with Jesus and they will come with Him at His return,
[3509.36 --> 3517.04]  reunited with resurrected bodies. The scriptures tell us that to die is gain, for if I die, I go to be with
[3517.04 --> 3523.54]  Christ. Right? The scriptures tell us that if we die and are away from the body, we are at home in the
[3523.54 --> 3530.90]  Lord. Jesus Himself, to the thief on the cross, when death was imminent for both of them, says,
[3531.28 --> 3540.68]  today you will be with me in paradise. Those who die go to be with Jesus.
[3540.68 --> 3547.74]  The third thing that we see here as we face death is that this new reality is real.
[3548.78 --> 3554.32]  We know it's real because it's given to us for all to see. Did you see that in verse 16?
[3555.10 --> 3556.34]  In verse 16, we read,
[3556.94 --> 3561.08]  For the Lord Himself will come down from heaven with a loud command and with the voice of the
[3561.08 --> 3566.50]  archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.
[3566.50 --> 3572.90]  Now, I don't know about you, but a loud command, a voice from the archangel and the trumpet call of
[3572.90 --> 3580.18]  God sure doesn't sound like a quiet secret coming to steal people away. Right? This is a visible,
[3580.76 --> 3587.60]  public, glorious return for all to see. And the rest of the Bible tells this same story.
[3588.40 --> 3595.18]  In Matthew 24, 27 to 21, we read that the Son of Man and His return will be visible like
[3595.18 --> 3601.90]  lightning in the east is visible in the west. We read that it will come with great power and glory.
[3601.90 --> 3609.62]  And again, we read that angels will trumpet it. In Revelation 1, 7, it says that He is coming with
[3609.62 --> 3617.64]  the clouds and every eye will see Him. Which makes sense because at the ascension of Jesus,
[3618.12 --> 3623.32]  the angels told the disciples who were staring up into the clouds looking, the angels said,
[3623.32 --> 3630.46]  this same Jesus who has been taken from you into heaven will come back in the same way that you
[3630.46 --> 3643.74]  have seen Him go into heaven, riding on the clouds. Right? This is real and it's for all to see.
[3643.74 --> 3655.80]  Number four, this real hope isn't escaping this world set for destruction, but the real hope is
[3655.80 --> 3667.42]  actually rooted in the ushering in of the defeat of death by death bringing new life. Verse 17 says,
[3667.42 --> 3675.40]  after that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to
[3675.40 --> 3684.16]  meet the Lord in the air and so we will be with the Lord forever. Now this is where that word,
[3684.86 --> 3694.70]  harpazo, becomes rapio, become rapture. This is where that happens. And is our hope really a rapture,
[3694.70 --> 3701.26]  an escape? An escape? Or is Paul doing something different here? Now this is going to take a little
[3701.26 --> 3706.70]  bit of brain work, so roll up your sleeves and dig in with me. This is where biblical theology becomes
[3706.70 --> 3718.50]  helpful to us. The Greek verb harpazo, caught up, is used by many writers to refer to people being caught
[3718.50 --> 3727.92]  up or snatched away from life to death. And so there's a first century Greek philosopher and historian
[3727.92 --> 3735.60]  named Plutarch. He uses it to refer to those who die an early death such that they are snatched away
[3735.60 --> 3742.22]  from the advantages of life such as marriage, education, manhood, citizenship, and public office.
[3742.22 --> 3751.04]  At the time, there are funeral inscriptions written that we have and have collected saying that fate
[3751.04 --> 3760.08]  has snatched away the living to the place of Hades. Or we also have writings from Lucian, who's a second
[3760.08 --> 3770.42]  century AD Roman satirist and rhetorician, and he writes a speech of a grieving father who cries out at the
[3770.42 --> 3780.06]  death of his son. And he says, dearest child, you are gone from me dead, snatched away, harpazo, before your time.
[3781.62 --> 3788.22]  And in all of these cases, the way this word is normally used, death is snatching people away from life.
[3789.44 --> 3797.04]  And so I tend to agree with Bible scholar Jeff Wyma, who concludes that Paul may have chosen this word,
[3797.04 --> 3805.34]  harpazo, not to describe a literal snatching away or rapture, but rather to make a clever pun, an inversion
[3805.34 --> 3813.00]  on the common use of this word. And so instead of being snatched away and caught up from life to death,
[3813.42 --> 3820.84]  Christians are the kind of people who are caught up from death to life, right? From life to new life.
[3820.84 --> 3830.56]  This is the inversion. This is the beauty of what's happening here in the gospel, right? This hope isn't
[3830.56 --> 3836.16]  about escaping a world set for destruction, but ushering in the defeat of death by being snatched
[3836.16 --> 3850.00]  from death into life. And then five, this real hope is forever. This is the rest of verse 17.
[3850.00 --> 3856.80]  We're caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with
[3856.80 --> 3864.76]  the Lord forever. So let's focus on the first idea there, to meet the Lord in the air.
[3866.20 --> 3873.80]  Now sometimes people take this idea and they tie it to the previous idea of being caught up to meet
[3873.80 --> 3879.98]  the Lord in the air. And they conclude that people are being gathered up into heaven and that
[3880.00 --> 3885.86]  is where we will be forever. And maybe as you read it in English, that kind of makes sense. It seems
[3885.86 --> 3890.62]  like the structure seems to go that way. But again, this is where that biblical theology thing becomes
[3890.62 --> 3898.90]  helpful. The Greek word that's used here, apentesis, doesn't refer generically to any kind of meeting,
[3898.90 --> 3908.62]  but it's actually a technical term that's used in that day to a specific custom of sending out a
[3908.62 --> 3917.58]  delegation of leading citizens, a reception party outside of the city in order to meet a visiting
[3917.58 --> 3927.26]  dignitary or member of a royal court, and then to escort that person in the final part of their journey
[3927.26 --> 3935.42]  back into the city from which they were sent. So let me paint a picture for you of this formal,
[3935.42 --> 3944.16]  technical use of the word to meet. This reception involves a group of prominent citizens who are
[3944.16 --> 3952.18]  chosen to be members of the delegation or the reception party, and they would journey out to meet the
[3952.18 --> 3962.12]  coming king or ruler or official. And city leaders would adopt a formal resolution to pay tribute,
[3962.12 --> 3969.64]  to offer worship to this visiting dignitary, and to host a banquet for them.
[3970.86 --> 3979.28]  And these citizens who go out would dress in their finest clothes, often white robes with laurel wreaths
[3979.28 --> 3985.94]  on their heads, with crowns on their head, and they would leave the city to meet the dignitary along
[3985.94 --> 3992.88]  the way. And after meeting and greeting the visiting dignitary, the reception party would escort this
[3992.88 --> 3999.50]  person the rest of the way into the city, heralding their coming, saying, the king is coming, the king is
[3999.50 --> 4006.58]  coming, make way, make ready for the feast of the king. And then sometimes this visiting dignitary,
[4006.68 --> 4012.80]  when they arrived and got to the place where they were at, they would pronounce judgment on prisoners.
[4012.80 --> 4019.00]  They would liberate some and set them free, and they would sentence others to execution.
[4020.66 --> 4027.86]  This is the picture that Paul is painting of the return of Christ. So that means that at the return
[4027.86 --> 4035.16]  of Christ, Christians are those dignitaries who go out. Christians usher him into the world as his
[4035.16 --> 4042.58]  kingdom restored for the work of judgment and ruling forever. Right? That's how we'll be with him
[4042.58 --> 4050.68]  forever under his rule in this world restored with our rightful king on the throne of his creation.
[4052.02 --> 4060.10]  And again, to be clear, this is how that word, to meet, is used in other places in the Bible as well.
[4061.06 --> 4071.22]  And so in Matthew 25, Jesus tells a parable of the ten virgins. And we read in that story,
[4071.22 --> 4077.38]  at midnight, the cry rang out, here is the bridegroom, come out and meet him. And the rest of the parable,
[4077.84 --> 4085.26]  the virgins who are ready, go out and join him, and they usher him into the wedding banquet.
[4086.36 --> 4093.92]  The same kind of thing happens, actually, in Acts 28, 15, when Paul arrives in Rome. If you read that
[4093.92 --> 4100.32]  story, the brothers and sisters of the church in Rome, who heard about Paul's coming, about his travels,
[4100.32 --> 4108.34]  they go out to meet him, and they journey with him for the last 60 or so kilometers coming into Rome.
[4109.70 --> 4116.46]  Now, all of this together, right, means that Christians aren't caught up or raptured in order
[4116.46 --> 4125.14]  to escape, but we're caught up to meet the Lord, to welcome the returning Jesus, and to usher him to his
[4125.14 --> 4137.36]  rightful place on the throne of this world, restored as his kingdom. That is the true story of what's going
[4137.36 --> 4149.84]  on here. And so, lastly, sixth, what we get here is a real hope because of a real end for the real world.
[4149.84 --> 4159.56]  And this is how we encourage one another. This is the word about God that we know about how the future
[4159.56 --> 4167.90]  shapes how we live in the present. Good theology is practical theology, and this is a word of hope for
[4167.90 --> 4175.50]  life in the face of death because death is not the end. Those who die know to be with Jesus,
[4175.50 --> 4184.44]  right, and this is real, and it's for all the world to see. And our hope is in the reality that death is
[4184.44 --> 4195.82]  defeated by life and that this new life is forever. I don't know about you, but that changes
[4195.82 --> 4207.02]  how we go through even death, whether yours or someone else's. Remember, death isn't the end.
[4207.90 --> 4217.58]  The resurrection, the return, and the reign of Jesus Christ is the end. And that is the most
[4217.58 --> 4225.34]  encouraging news you will ever hear. Amen. Let's pray together.
[4232.02 --> 4239.90]  God, you are so good. Even in the face of death, you have given us this gospel,
[4239.90 --> 4249.14]  this truth that death is not the end, that even that enemy has been defeated by Jesus Christ.
[4250.72 --> 4253.54]  And so there is no victory left for death,
[4254.26 --> 4264.02]  that the sting of death is overcome by the resurrection of Jesus as a guarantee of our future
[4264.02 --> 4271.98]  and glorious resurrection. And so, Lord God, especially now as we enter this season of Lent,
[4272.88 --> 4281.42]  especially now as we prepare our hearts to meet you at the table, may we come in the truth and the hope
[4281.42 --> 4289.52]  of this resurrection, in the truth and the hope of your return, in the truth and the hope of your reign
[4289.52 --> 4298.28]  forever in this world restored. And so, God, even as we stare death in the face today,
[4298.28 --> 4303.50]  we do so as those who sit around the banquet table of the King.
[4305.54 --> 4309.52]  At this table, we proclaim your death until you come again.
[4309.52 --> 4318.18]  Amen. And so, Lord Jesus, come quickly, we pray. In your name alone. Amen.
[4327.08 --> 4332.92]  As we come to this table together, especially in the beginning of this season,
[4332.92 --> 4341.18]  we do so reflecting on the death of Jesus Christ, reflecting on our own mortality and the sin that
[4341.18 --> 4349.34]  brought him to the cross and on his suffering in our place. We do so as a community of believers
[4349.34 --> 4355.68]  together. We will have some words of liturgy for you to speak, encourage you to speak them as you're
[4355.68 --> 4362.24]  indicated on the screen, to join your hearts in prayer as we pray, because we come now to the table
[4362.24 --> 4373.82]  of our Lord. Lift up your hearts. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. Let's pray together.
[4375.98 --> 4383.00]  With joy, we praise you, gracious God, for you have created heaven and earth. You've made us
[4383.00 --> 4390.48]  in your image. You have kept covenant with us, even when we fell into sin. We give you thanks for Jesus
[4390.48 --> 4398.56]  Christ, who by his life, death and resurrection, open to us the way of everlasting life. Amen.
[4401.94 --> 4409.54]  Our Lord Jesus, before he suffered, gave us this memorial of his sacrifice until he comes again.
[4410.46 --> 4415.16]  The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread. And when he had given thanks,
[4415.16 --> 4426.04]  he broke it and said, this is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me. And in the same way,
[4426.66 --> 4435.88]  he took the cup after supper and he said, this cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this whenever you
[4435.88 --> 4438.88]  drink it? Do this when you drink it? Do this when you drink it? In remembrance of me.
[4442.46 --> 4450.56]  For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.
[4450.56 --> 4461.90]  This is the mystery of our faith. Your death, O Christ, we proclaim. Your resurrection, we affirm with joy.
[4462.58 --> 4467.64]  Your coming, we await with hope. Glory be to you, Lord Jesus.
[4469.26 --> 4476.12]  Church family, the Lord has prepared his table for all who love him and trust in him alone for their
[4476.12 --> 4482.86]  salvation. And so come to this table, you who have much faith and you who would like to have more.
[4483.56 --> 4489.00]  Come to this table, you who have been here often and you who have not been for a long time.
[4489.34 --> 4496.24]  Come to this table, you who have tried to follow Jesus and you who have failed. Come to this table
[4496.24 --> 4505.84]  because Jesus Christ has been raised and so we proclaim victory by his death. Come to this table.
[4505.84 --> 4511.74]  If you are here in person or if you are at home and online, come to this table because it is Christ
[4511.74 --> 4522.04]  who meets us here. The gifts of God for the people of God. As we come to this table together,
[4522.84 --> 4530.62]  we will do so in a particular manner for Emmanuel Church. We will gather in groups in the front and
[4530.62 --> 4536.90]  we will encircle the table and you will be invited to pass the bread and pass the juice to the person
[4536.90 --> 4542.04]  to your left or to your right. When you pass the bread, we invite you to say the body of Christ
[4542.04 --> 4547.74]  given for you. When you pass the juice, we invite you to say the blood of Christ shed for you.
[4549.34 --> 4554.38]  As we come to this table, we're going to have the first group come up, which will be the worship
[4554.38 --> 4559.92]  leaders, the elders and the like who are going to help facilitate our serving together. Afterwards,
[4560.48 --> 4565.76]  they will go up on stage and lead us in song for when you're not up here and there will be
[4565.76 --> 4572.40]  serving elders to indicate when you can come to the front together. If you are unable to come to the
[4572.40 --> 4578.38]  front but would like to receive the supper, please indicate that to the elder who is ushering and
[4578.38 --> 4583.82]  they will meet you where you are and they will serve you, also saying the body of Christ given
[4583.82 --> 4590.28]  for you and the blood of Christ shed for you. For those who desire, there's gluten-free bread in
[4590.28 --> 4595.82]  the center of each tray of bread as well and there's some up here off to the side if you need
[4595.82 --> 4601.30]  complete separation for that. I'm going to invite those who are helping us serve this morning up to
[4601.30 --> 4605.98]  the front, elders and worship leaders, we can receive the first round of the table.
[4608.38 --> 4616.30]  As they are coming to the front, I'd also like to make known that there are prayer partners
[4616.30 --> 4621.40]  available, people with yellow name tags will be in the foyer at the back there if you'd like to meet
[4621.40 --> 4626.46]  someone and receive prayer in lieu of coming up to the front or before you come up or even after you
[4626.46 --> 4632.76]  come up to the front, you can meet them for prayer as part of your experience of God here at the table
[4632.76 --> 4633.16]  together.
[4638.38 --> 4643.20]  Body of Christ given for you.

[4659.16 --> 4660.68]  bottom, you may see you the other individuals who are going to follow up to the front, but as you
