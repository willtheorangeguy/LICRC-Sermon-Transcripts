[0.00 → 14.14] And from the cross to an empty grave, He rose to life, He rose to life.
[14.14 → 28.42] He lives, reigning in power. He lives, name above all names. Hallelujah.
[30.00 → 39.54] Now forever. Hallelujah. Christ is risen.
[40.98 → 57.26] All glory to Him upon the throne. Forever exalted and seated at the Lamb of God.
[57.26 → 67.00] He has overcome. He is alive. He is alive.
[67.00 → 82.26] He lives, reigning in power. He lives, name above all names. Hallelujah.
[82.26 → 97.00] Now forever. Hallelujah. Christ is risen. He is risen.
[97.00 → 109.58] And on that day with Him, I rise. For Christ He lives in me.
[109.58 → 111.32] He lives.
[111.32 → 122.32] This life I live. No longer mine. For Christ He lives in me.
[122.32 → 124.06] Oh.
[124.06 → 135.06] And on that day with Him, I rise. For Christ He lives in me.
[135.06 → 136.06] He lives.
[136.06 → 137.80] He lives.
[137.80 → 151.80] He lives.
[151.80 → 157.54] He lives.
[157.54 → 160.54] He lives.
[160.54 → 162.54] He lives.
[162.54 → 163.54] He lives.
[163.54 → 165.54] of all names
[165.54 → 167.54] Hallelujah
[167.54 → 171.54] Now forever
[171.54 → 173.54] Hallelujah
[173.54 → 177.54] Christ is risen
[177.54 → 179.54] Healing
[179.54 → 183.54] Reigning in power
[183.54 → 185.54] Healing
[185.54 → 189.54] In the name of all names
[189.54 → 191.54] Hallelujah
[191.54 → 193.54] Hallelujah
[193.54 → 195.54] Now forever
[195.54 → 197.54] Hallelujah
[197.54 → 201.54] Christ is risen
[201.54 → 207.54] At the feet of Jesus I will lay my verse
[207.54 → 217.54] My burdens down
[217.54 → 219.54] I will lay my burdens down
[219.54 → 229.54] I will lay my heavy burdens down
[229.54 → 231.54] I will lay my heavy burdens down
[231.54 → 235.54] I will lay my heavy burdens down
[235.54 → 239.54] In the stillness I can hear my Saviour calling out
[239.54 → 243.54] Come to me and lay your burdens down
[243.54 → 245.54] I will lay your burdens down
[245.54 → 247.54] I will lay my burdens down
[247.54 → 249.54] I will lay my burdens down
[249.54 → 251.54] I will lay down my struggles
[251.54 → 253.54] I will lay down my shame
[253.54 → 255.54] And all the fear I drive around through this life
[255.54 → 257.54] Like a ball and chain
[257.54 → 259.54] And I will sing
[259.54 → 261.54] And I will lay my burdens down
[261.54 → 263.54] And I will lay my burdens down
[263.54 → 265.54] And I will lay my burdens down
[265.54 → 267.54] And I will lay my burdens down
[267.54 → 269.54] And I will lay my shame
[269.54 → 271.54] And all the fear I drive around through this life
[271.54 → 273.54] Like a ball and chain
[273.54 → 275.54] And I will sing
[275.54 → 277.54] Hallelujah to the one who sets me free
[277.54 → 283.54] And you will find me at the feet of Jesus
[283.54 → 289.54] And you will find me at the feet of Jesus
[289.54 → 293.54] And you will find me at the feet of Jesus
[293.54 → 303.54] In the arms of Jesus I will find my peace and rest
[303.54 → 305.54] I hear Him calling
[305.54 → 309.54] I hear Him calling, come to me, yes
[309.54 → 313.54] Carried by my shepherd
[313.54 → 317.54] Cradled tightly to His chest
[317.54 → 323.54] There and there alone my soul finds rest
[323.54 → 331.54] So I will rest in the shelter of my Saviour's embrace
[331.54 → 337.54] Hidden safely in the refuge of His mercy and His grace
[337.54 → 347.54] And I will sing hallelujah to the one who sets me free
[347.54 → 353.54] And you will find me in the arms of Jesus
[353.54 → 355.54] The arms of Jesus
[383.54 → 385.54] To the Himalayas
[385.54 → 389.54] To the Himalayas
[389.54 → 393.54] To the Himalayas
[393.54 → 395.54] Water you turned into wine
[395.54 → 399.54] Open the eyes of the blind
[399.54 → 403.54] There's no one like you
[403.54 → 405.54] None like you
[405.54 → 407.54] None like you
[407.54 → 414.16] Into the darkness you shine
[414.16 → 418.94] Out of the ashes we rise
[418.94 → 421.54] There's no one like you
[421.54 → 427.50] None like you
[427.50 → 431.34] Our God is greater
[431.34 → 433.80] Our God is stronger
[433.80 → 437.22] God you are higher than any
[437.22 → 438.24] Other
[438.24 → 440.92] Our God is healer
[440.92 → 442.90] Awesome in power
[442.90 → 444.18] Our God
[444.18 → 447.30] Our God
[447.30 → 459.96] Into the darkness you shine
[459.96 → 464.64] Out of the ashes we rise
[464.64 → 467.34] There's no one like you
[467.34 → 472.64] None like you
[472.64 → 477.04] Our God is greater
[477.04 → 479.50] Our God is stronger
[479.50 → 482.96] God you are higher than any
[482.96 → 483.98] Other
[483.98 → 498.16] Good morning
[498.16 → 501.52] Good morning
[501.52 → 502.48] There it is
[502.48 → 504.22] I love the murmur
[504.22 → 505.36] This morning
[505.36 → 507.24] It seems like there's a lot of excitement
[507.24 → 509.04] To gather together
[509.04 → 511.10] It is so good to be together
[511.10 → 512.98] And to worship our God this morning
[512.98 → 514.54] If you're a guest here
[514.54 → 515.30] My name is Chris
[515.30 → 517.90] I'm one of the pastors at Emanuel
[517.90 → 520.54] And it's my privilege with these others
[520.54 → 523.88] To lead in our shared worship this morning
[523.88 → 526.78] If you are a regular here
[526.78 → 529.92] You might look around and notice a missing demographic
[529.92 → 532.88] And that is because the GEMS
[532.88 → 534.48] Our young girls' ministry
[534.48 → 536.48] Is camping this weekend
[536.48 → 539.06] And so they're having their own worship service at camp
[539.06 → 541.04] Together with a few other leaders
[541.04 → 544.12] And so they aren't here with us this morning
[544.12 → 546.88] But they are indeed there at camp worshipping together
[546.88 → 548.76] And so we include them in our worship
[548.76 → 550.36] And we pray with them and for them
[550.36 → 552.24] In that weekend time together
[552.24 → 553.36] Before we begin
[553.36 → 555.28] We do have a couple announcements to make
[555.28 → 557.44] And, so I'm going to invite Brenda up to the front
[557.44 → 559.66] She's going to make an announcement on behalf of the deacons
[559.66 → 562.00] And then while she's coming up
[562.00 → 563.88] I just want to invite everyone
[563.88 → 566.04] Following our worship this morning
[566.04 → 568.40] We will have an opportunity to gather
[568.40 → 570.28] For refreshments at the back
[570.28 → 572.52] And you may have noticed on your way in
[572.52 → 573.76] Some tables set up
[573.76 → 577.52] And that's because we are being invited
[577.52 → 580.54] To celebrate the 50th wedding anniversary
[580.54 → 583.66] Of John and Elsa Hubert's
[583.66 → 587.26] And so they have provided cake for us to share together
[587.26 → 593.16] And so that is after our service together
[593.16 → 595.08] Please stick around for that
[595.08 → 595.68] Brenda
[595.68 → 597.20] Good morning
[597.20 → 599.00] On behalf of the deacons
[599.00 → 600.24] I just wanted to do

[602.06 → 604.22] For next week Sunday
[604.22 → 606.04] Which is Mother's Day
[606.04 → 609.94] We are going to be doing the baby bottle campaign
[609.94 → 612.26] We're joining with Advocate again
[612.26 → 613.42] And so we're starting
[613.42 → 616.74] We'll be starting handing out baby bottles next week
[616.74 → 618.16] That

[621.14 → 623.50] And you can fill those with

[625.28 → 625.76] A check
[625.76 → 628.34] There will be a sheet inside of them
[628.34 → 631.00] That you can also just go directly to their website
[631.00 → 632.60] However you would like to give
[632.60 → 636.02] But that is going to be started next week
[636.02 → 638.34] Also if you are interested
[638.34 → 641.06] Advocate is hosting another fundraiser
[641.06 → 642.56] Which is their Walk for Life
[642.56 → 645.52] And that will be June the 7th
[645.52 → 646.94] From 1230 to 4
[646.94 → 649.36] At Mill Lake Park in Abbotsford
[649.36 → 650.28] Thank you
[650.28 → 651.68] Thanks Brenda
[651.68 → 654.62] And then lastly
[654.62 → 655.80] Today
[655.80 → 657.58] Our youth ministry
[657.58 → 660.16] Is having youth coffee
[660.16 → 663.18] Together following our worship service
[663.18 → 664.88] And so that's where the youth ministry
[664.88 → 666.34] Go to someone's house
[666.34 → 667.74] From our church family
[667.74 → 668.96] And have coffee
[668.96 → 669.96] A little lunch there
[669.96 → 671.14] After our service
[671.14 → 673.50] And that is happening at the Porter's house
[673.50 → 675.22] And so Tara is at the back
[675.22 → 677.00] She can tell you where to go
[677.00 → 678.78] Or Pastor Kevin can tell you where to go
[678.78 → 679.58] But
[679.58 → 680.90] I need you to hear this
[680.90 → 682.08] Tara has asked
[682.08 → 685.76] That you stay and enjoy the cake and coffee here
[685.76 → 687.40] So she has time to get home
[687.40 → 688.86] And prepare for all you all showing up
[688.86 → 690.90] She doesn't want to arrive
[690.90 → 692.62] To like 30 of you waiting eagerly
[692.62 → 693.58] To get into her house
[693.58 → 695.10] So just give her some time
[695.10 → 697.14] To transition to hosting you there
[697.14 → 698.30] She would appreciate that
[698.30 → 699.66] I think that's it
[699.66 → 700.92] For our announcements this morning
[700.92 → 701.98] So I'm going to invite you
[701.98 → 702.72] As you're able
[702.72 → 703.30] And where you are
[703.30 → 703.92] To stand
[703.92 → 705.30] So we can be gathered
[705.30 → 706.62] Into the presence of God
[706.62 → 707.52] Together
[707.52 → 713.02] God is here among us
[713.02 → 713.96] We know that
[713.96 → 715.00] And we mark that
[715.00 → 717.06] By receiving his greeting
[717.06 → 719.46] And by turning that greeting
[719.46 → 720.26] From God
[720.26 → 721.02] To a greeting
[721.02 → 722.08] To one another
[722.08 → 723.58] And so after I give you
[723.58 → 724.80] God's greeting this morning
[724.80 → 725.76] I invite you to turn
[725.76 → 726.70] To those around you
[726.70 → 727.70] And to welcome them

[728.94 → 729.94] Into worship

[730.98 → 731.82] Peace of Christ
[731.82 → 732.78] Be with you

[744.86 → 745.78] And our Saviour
[745.78 → 746.84] Through the presence
[746.84 → 747.46] And power
[747.46 → 748.82] Of the Holy Spirit
[748.82 → 750.16] Amen

[789.46 → 790.52] Call
[790.52 → 791.00] To

[800.28 → 801.92] Good morning, everyone.
[802.20 → 808.72] Our call to worship this morning comes from Romans chapter 11, verses 33 to 36.
[809.50 → 814.00] Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God.
[814.70 → 819.46] How unsearchable his judgments and his paths beyond tracing out.
[819.46 → 824.38] Who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counsellor?
[825.30 → 829.80] Who has ever given to God that God should repay them?
[830.98 → 835.60] For from him and through him and for him are all things.
[836.12 → 838.62] To him be the glory forever. Amen.
[849.46 → 858.96] A thousand generations falling down in worship
[858.96 → 864.30] To sing the song of ages to the Lamb
[864.30 → 869.76] And all who've gone before us
[869.76 → 872.30] And all who will redeem

[900.02 → 902.14] Your name

[945.36 → 948.36] Amen
[948.36 → 951.36] And if you walk in freedom
[951.36 → 954.36] And if you bear his name
[954.36 → 959.36] We'll sing this song forever to the Lamb
[959.36 → 966.36] We'll sing this song forever and Amen
[966.36 → 970.36] And the angels cry
[970.36 → 977.30] Holy, all creation cries.
[977.80 → 983.36] Holy, you are lifted high.
[984.58 → 990.16] Holy, holy forever.

[1250.00 → 1262.80] our confession this morning are words from a gentleman named Douglas Kane McKenzie from a
[1263.44 → 1270.24] book called every moment holy and this is a liturgy for those of us all of us who
[1270.24 → 1278.24] have destructive desires in our life and I think we can all relate to something in our life that's
[1278.24 → 1285.44] destructive at any point, and so I just encourage you to reflect on these words this prayer close your
[1285.44 → 1293.12] eyes if you wish uh here are the words a liturgy for one battling a destructive desire
[1295.92 → 1304.48] Jesus here I am again desiring a thing that were i to indulge in it would war against my own heart
[1304.48 → 1314.40] and the hearts of those I love oh Christ rather let my life be thine take my desires let them be
[1314.40 → 1321.44] subsumed in still greater desire for you until there remains no room for these lesser cravings
[1321.44 → 1330.08] at this moment I might choose to indulge a fleeting hunger or I might choose to love you more
[1331.68 → 1340.96] faced with temptation I would rather choose you Jesus but I am weak so be my strength I am shadowed be my
[1340.96 → 1349.84] light I am selfish to unmake me now and refashion my desires according to the better designs of your love
[1349.84 → 1360.56] love given the choice of shame or glory let me choose glory given the choice of this moment or eternity let me
[1360.56 → 1369.36] choose at this moment what is eternal given the choice of this easy pleasure or the harder road of the cross
[1370.40 → 1378.48] give me grace to choose to follow you knowing that there is nowhere apart from your presence where I might
[1378.48 → 1388.88] find the peace i long for no lasting satisfaction apart from the reclamation of my heart let me build then my king
[1389.44 → 1399.20] a beautiful thing by long obedience by the steady progression of small choices that laid end to end will become like stones
[1399.84 → 1408.40] of a pleasing path stretching to eternity and unto your welcoming arms and unto the sound of your
[1408.40 → 1412.48] your voice pronouncing the judgment well done
[1416.16 → 1429.36] please stand and join us as we continue to sing all I have is Christ
[1429.36 → 1438.32] your voice
[1438.32 → 1456.96] I once was lost in the darkest night yet thought I knew the way the sin that promised joy and life
[1456.96 → 1469.36] had led me to the grave I had no hope that you would hold a rebel to
[1469.36 → 1481.92] your will and if you had not loved me first I would refuse you still
[1481.92 → 1490.88] still
[1490.88 → 1492.88] but as I ran
[1492.88 → 1498.00] my hell-bound grace indifferent to
[1498.00 → 1502.88] the cost you looked upon
[1502.88 → 1511.84] my helpless state and led me to
[1511.84 → 1520.80] and I beheld god's love displayed you suffered in
[1520.80 → 1530.80] my place you bore the wrath reserved for me now all I know is
[1530.80 → 1553.84] my
[1553.84 → 1572.56] is my life now lord I would be yours alone and live, so all might see the strength to follow
[1572.56 → 1590.16] your commands could never come from me oh father use my ransom life in any way you choose
[1590.16 → 1599.60] and let my song forever be my only post is you
[1603.52 → 1613.28] all I have is Christ
[1613.28 → 1633.92] alleluia Jesus is my life alleluia all I have is Christ
[1633.92 → 1647.92] alleluia Jesus is my life
[1647.92 → 1669.52] this is my prayer in the desert when all that's within me feels dry
[1669.52 → 1677.52] this is my prayer in my hunger and need my god is the god who provides
[1679.20 → 1685.52] this is my prayer in the fire in weakness or trial or pain
[1685.52 → 1703.20] I will bring praise I will bring praise no weapon formed against me shall remain
[1703.20 → 1711.20] I will rejoice I will declare god is my victory, and he is
[1711.20 → 1717.20] me
[1717.20 → 1726.40] this is my prayer in the battle when triumph is still on its way
[1726.40 → 1732.40] I am
[1732.40 → 1736.40] I am
[1736.40 → 1742.40] I will bring praise I will bring praise no weapon formed against me shall remain
[1742.40 → 1754.40] I will rejoice I will declare god is my victory, and he is
[1754.40 → 1756.88] I will
[1756.88 → 1760.32] and I will bring praise no weapon
[1760.32 → 1762.40] I am
[1762.40 → 1764.40] I will bring praise no weapon
[1764.40 → 1766.40] I am
[1766.40 → 1768.40] I am
[1768.40 → 1770.40] I am
[1770.40 → 1772.40] I am
[1772.40 → 1774.40] I am
[1774.40 → 1776.40] I am
[1776.40 → 1778.40] I am
[1778.40 → 1780.40] I am
[1780.40 → 1802.40] I am
[1802.40 → 1804.40] I am
[1804.40 → 1807.78] I have a reason to worship.
[1810.94 → 1817.20] All of my life, in every season, you are still God.
[1817.60 → 1820.54] I have a reason to sing.
[1821.60 → 1824.54] I have a reason to worship.
[1826.80 → 1829.36] I will bring praise.
[1829.46 → 1831.38] I will bring praise.
[1831.38 → 1835.24] No weapon formed against me shall remain.
[1835.78 → 1837.46] I will rejoice.
[1838.02 → 1839.40] I will declare.
[1840.18 → 1844.14] God is my victory and He is here.
[1844.52 → 1846.48] I will bring praise.
[1846.76 → 1848.60] I will bring praise.
[1848.98 → 1852.36] No weapon formed against me shall remain.
[1853.04 → 1854.56] I will rejoice.
[1855.24 → 1856.50] I will declare.
[1856.50 → 1861.46] God is my victory and He is here.
[1861.46 → 1862.46] God is my victory and He is here.
[1862.46 → 1863.46] I will declare.
[1863.46 → 1864.46] I will declare.
[1864.46 → 1865.46] I will declare.
[1865.46 → 1866.46] I will declare.
[1866.46 → 1867.46] I will declare.
[1867.46 → 1868.46] I will declare.
[1868.46 → 1869.46] I will declare.
[1869.46 → 1872.46] This is my prayer in the harvest.
[1872.46 → 1877.46] When favour and providence flow.
[1877.46 → 1882.46] I know I fail to be emptied again.
[1882.46 → 1885.46] The seed I've received.
[1885.46 → 1887.46] I will sow.
[1887.46 → 1891.60] You may have a seat.
[1901.32 → 1904.84] We just sang, the seed I have received, I will sow.
[1905.28 → 1912.14] And we have the opportunity to give thanks to God for seeds sown and planted, watered,
[1912.14 → 1915.46] and received as we welcome new members.
[1915.46 → 1921.78] And so I didn't say it earlier, but a special welcome to you if you're here for Cole and Natasha
[1921.78 → 1926.56] and for Adrian, and thank you for joining with us in worship this morning.
[1927.16 → 1935.46] We're going to invite Cole and Natasha up to the front as we welcome them into our shared
[1935.46 → 1940.44] church family together, and then we will baptize Adrian following that.
[1940.44 → 1947.80] This morning we are blessed to welcome you guys officially into our church fellowship
[1947.80 → 1948.44] and family.
[1948.44 → 1951.32] You've been worshipping with us for a while now, and we're grateful for that.
[1951.76 → 1954.40] Let's move over there so that we can stand together.
[1956.68 → 1960.28] Cole and Natasha come to us from Linden, Washington.
[1960.68 → 1964.48] They make the trip in multiple times every week for different things.
[1964.62 → 1970.34] Natasha has been part of our coffee break program every Tuesday, and sometimes because
[1970.34 → 1974.88] of Adrian, she's not in that group, but hangs out with the staff when we have coffee at
[1974.88 → 1975.62] that same time.
[1975.78 → 1978.66] And so we've gotten to know her in that way too, which has been a lot of fun.
[1979.66 → 1984.58] As part of our membership process, I run a membership class a few times a year.
[1985.36 → 1990.54] And if you're wondering what kind of people Cole and Natasha are, let me tell you that Cole
[1990.54 → 1996.88] asked the most particular and unexpected question I've ever been asked during one of these new
[1996.88 → 1997.58] member classes.
[1998.48 → 2001.46] And I'm going to let you talk to them and ask him what that question was.
[2002.92 → 2004.64] It was about the gift of apostleship.
[2007.84 → 2013.80] As we welcome you this morning, Cole and Natasha, we welcome you into the fellowship of this church.
[2013.80 → 2019.72] And it's our hope and our prayer that here, together, your faith in God will be strengthened,
[2020.18 → 2025.80] that your love for Jesus will be grown, and that you will find opportunity to serve in the spirit
[2025.80 → 2031.38] as you join with us on mission for this community, this neighbourhood, and to the world.
[2032.24 → 2036.82] As we welcome you into this church family, we ask that you would affirm the faith that you have
[2036.82 → 2043.48] professed and your commitment to God's mission in and through Langley and Linden, in and through
[2043.48 → 2046.38] this city and region, and to the world.
[2046.74 → 2048.56] And to do so, I'm going to ask you three questions.
[2049.06 → 2053.06] After I ask all three, I invite you to respond by saying we do, with God's help.
[2054.02 → 2060.56] First, do you believe in Jesus as your Saviour and Lord, and that in him alone is hope and freedom
[2060.56 → 2061.54] from sin found?
[2061.54 → 2067.06] Second, do you believe that the Bible is the word of God, revealing his plan of redemption
[2067.06 → 2071.46] in Jesus Christ, and that the preaching and teaching of Langley and Emmanuel reflect this
[2071.46 → 2071.84] truth?
[2072.78 → 2077.84] And then third, do you promise, with the help of the Holy Spirit, to do all that you can
[2077.84 → 2083.26] to strengthen your relationship to Jesus by being part of this church, recognizing its
[2083.26 → 2089.40] oversight and authority, and joining with us on mission for Jesus in this community, this
[2089.40 → 2090.62] city, and to the world?
[2090.62 → 2092.74] Cole and Natasha, what is your answer?
[2093.18 → 2094.48] We do, with God's help.
[2094.66 → 2094.92] Amen.
[2095.40 → 2097.42] Why don't we switch sides so we don't have to worry about him?
[2097.66 → 2097.82] Yep.
[2100.26 → 2101.78] Candles are always dangerous.
[2103.56 → 2111.38] Part of our welcoming you into our fellowship is extending to you and through your faith to
[2111.38 → 2115.86] Adrian the inclusion of God's covenant promises.
[2115.86 → 2120.76] So this morning, we get to celebrate his baptism together.
[2121.76 → 2128.54] The water, for us, is a sign and a seal of being cleansed from sin through Jesus' life,
[2128.90 → 2129.98] death, and resurrection.
[2130.90 → 2138.02] Though born with a sinful nature, this child, Adrian, is offered God's promise of forgiveness
[2138.02 → 2139.50] and life in the Spirit.
[2139.50 → 2146.50] We baptize infants not from superstition, but because they are covenant children.
[2147.00 → 2152.18] We baptize infants as an extension of the history of the church from its very beginning.
[2153.62 → 2161.88] God's covenant with Abraham was sealed by circumcision in Genesis 15 and now finds its sign in baptism
[2161.88 → 2163.52] as we read in Colossians 2.
[2164.52 → 2169.54] And through it, the triune God marks our adoption and identity in Christ,
[2169.90 → 2174.16] a promise that is extended to our children as we read in Acts 2 verse 39,
[2174.58 → 2176.36] because God calls them holy.
[2176.74 → 2179.94] He calls them set apart as we read in 1 Corinthians 7.
[2181.10 → 2183.38] And so baptism obeys Christ's command.
[2183.86 → 2186.08] It aligns with the living traditions of the church
[2186.08 → 2190.14] and it signifies inclusion into God's covenant community.
[2190.14 → 2197.54] And today, we pray that Adrian embraces these promises and follows Jesus throughout his life.
[2198.10 → 2201.72] So I have two more questions to ask you in regard to this, Cole and Natasha.
[2202.36 → 2206.54] Again, I'll ask you the two questions and invite you to respond by saying we do with God's help.
[2207.84 → 2213.20] Do you believe that your child, Adrian, as cute as he is, though sinful by nature,
[2213.68 → 2218.40] is received by God in Christ as a member of his covenant and therefore ought to be baptized?
[2218.40 → 2225.28] And two, do you promise, in reliance on the Holy Spirit and with the help of this Christian community,
[2225.76 → 2229.34] to do all in your power to instruct Adrian in the Christian faith
[2229.34 → 2233.50] and to lead him by your example into the life of Christian discipleship?
[2234.02 → 2234.74] What is your answer?
[2235.30 → 2236.68] We do with God's help.
[2236.86 → 2237.18] Amen.
[2237.18 → 2239.80] Our Lord Jesus said,
[2240.04 → 2242.90] Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them,
[2243.02 → 2245.24] for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
[2245.36 → 2247.38] And so, as is our practice,
[2247.50 → 2251.76] I want to invite all the little children and the young at heart to come forward,
[2251.88 → 2254.24] come close, gather around here at the front.
[2254.34 → 2258.04] Just find a seat on the floor right here so that you can see
[2258.04 → 2264.76] and that you can be part of this sign and seal together.
[2264.76 → 2266.18] Yeah, see them all?
[2275.22 → 2277.74] Guys, in just a moment, we're going to take this water
[2277.74 → 2281.76] and we're going to pour it over Adrian's head
[2281.76 → 2289.26] as a picture for us, a living picture for us about what Jesus has promised, right?
[2289.26 → 2293.92] That he would wash us and make us new and that he includes us in his family.
[2294.68 → 2298.82] And so, many of you have also received this sign of baptism.
[2299.32 → 2302.44] And if you haven't received this sign or if you don't remember it, talk to your parents.
[2303.20 → 2306.78] And parents, if you haven't received it or if you haven't talked to your kids about it, talk to me.
[2307.24 → 2309.70] I would love to talk to you about what that means for you.
[2311.24 → 2315.40] We're going to baptize Adrian together this morning.
[2315.40 → 2315.84] Are you ready?
[2316.98 → 2317.30] Yeah?
[2317.64 → 2318.00] All right.
[2318.72 → 2320.04] Just lean him in here a bit.
[2323.16 → 2327.76] Adrian, James, Paul, Bergen.
[2328.02 → 2329.70] I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[2330.88 → 2332.02] in the name of the Son,
[2333.32 → 2334.82] and in the name of the Holy Spirit.
[2336.10 → 2336.38] Amen.
[2337.86 → 2338.30] Amen.
[2338.30 → 2338.36] Amen.
[2340.18 → 2341.32] Just for his face there.
[2345.40 → 2350.54] congregation of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[2350.70 → 2353.10] church family gathered here today.
[2353.44 → 2356.58] Not only do we hear promises from God in baptism
[2356.58 → 2358.58] and promises from parents in baptism,
[2358.88 → 2362.90] but we have an opportunity to hear promises from our shared family.
[2363.30 → 2366.54] So I'm going to invite you, again, as you're able, where you are, to stand.
[2366.54 → 2370.68] And I'm going to offer, read out a question for you,
[2370.92 → 2373.08] at the end of which I invite you to respond,
[2373.22 → 2376.12] together with one voice we do with God's help.
[2377.74 → 2379.04] And so do you,
[2379.98 → 2382.82] congregation of Emmanuel Christian Reformed Church,
[2382.94 → 2385.32] representing the entire church of Jesus Christ,
[2385.68 → 2386.54] gathered here today,
[2386.64 → 2389.88] do you promise to love, encourage, and support
[2389.88 → 2392.14] Cole, Natasha, and Adrian
[2392.14 → 2394.88] by welcoming them into our church family,
[2395.36 → 2398.60] by teaching him the gospel of God's love,
[2398.68 → 2401.22] by being an example of Christian faith and character,
[2401.54 → 2404.34] and by giving the strong support of God's family
[2404.34 → 2407.22] in fellowship, in prayer, and in service?
[2407.40 → 2408.44] What is your answer?
[2409.12 → 2410.98] We do it for God's help.
[2411.38 → 2411.86] Amen.
[2412.98 → 2414.02] Please have a seat.
[2416.44 → 2417.70] Let me stay here for a minute.
[2419.10 → 2419.50] Adrian,
[2420.50 → 2421.88] my brother,
[2422.14 → 2423.74] the Lord bless you
[2423.74 → 2425.02] and keep you.
[2425.60 → 2427.62] The Lord make his face to shine upon you
[2427.62 → 2429.02] and be gracious to you.
[2429.36 → 2431.82] The Lord turn his face towards you
[2431.82 → 2434.08] and give you his peace.
[2434.84 → 2436.00] And in this way,
[2436.16 → 2438.76] may the Lord put his name on Adrian
[2438.76 → 2440.72] and make him his own.
[2441.30 → 2441.52] Amen?
[2442.44 → 2443.00] Amen.
[2443.78 → 2445.10] May I take him for a minute?
[2446.32 → 2447.24] Hey, my buddy.
[2448.24 → 2448.76] Hi.
[2448.76 → 2448.82] Hi.
[2450.44 → 2451.46] You want to go for a walk?
[2452.14 → 2455.02] This morning,
[2455.22 → 2457.80] as we celebrate baptism together,
[2458.20 → 2461.72] this is a living picture for us
[2461.72 → 2464.70] of Adrian's journey of faith.
[2465.44 → 2465.98] And so,
[2466.10 → 2467.16] he joins us
[2467.16 → 2470.36] and becomes part of our church family together,
[2470.74 → 2472.64] wherein we hope and pray
[2472.64 → 2475.02] that he will grow to know the Lord.
[2475.02 → 2479.20] And that he will one day stand before us
[2479.20 → 2480.02] and say,
[2480.18 → 2480.92] this too,
[2481.14 → 2481.92] I believe.
[2482.72 → 2485.74] That this promise of God is real for him
[2485.74 → 2487.56] and not just words we speak,
[2488.36 → 2490.12] but that it defines reality.
[2491.48 → 2494.70] And as he joins us in this blessed fellowship,
[2495.50 → 2499.76] may you walk with him in this journey of life and faith.
[2499.76 → 2505.34] May you know him as a spiritual son in the Lord,
[2506.10 → 2508.38] because that is who he is to us.
[2508.60 → 2508.84] Amen?
[2510.06 → 2510.50] Amen.
[2511.78 → 2512.72] Good work, buddy.
[2512.72 → 2519.24] I want to invite Dick Lingering to come to the front.
[2519.40 → 2522.16] He is an elder in our church,
[2522.72 → 2525.66] and you guys have been placed into his region,
[2525.84 → 2526.56] his group,
[2526.70 → 2531.20] and so he's got a little memento of today's celebration
[2531.20 → 2532.80] and a little gift for Adrian,
[2532.94 → 2534.24] a book that you can read with him,
[2534.54 → 2537.48] as well as a new member booklet that we give to everyone.
[2537.48 → 2538.48] Amen.
[2548.98 → 2549.42] Amen.
[2549.62 → 2550.64] Thank you guys so much.
[2550.90 → 2551.94] Let's welcome them together.
[2553.20 → 2563.40] We're going to sing a song together
[2563.40 → 2565.80] that they have chosen for us
[2565.80 → 2567.78] as a momentum of this occasion.
[2568.00 → 2569.52] We're going to stand, and we're going to sing
[2569.52 → 2571.06] Be Thou My Vision.
[2571.32 → 2572.84] Following our worship today,
[2573.04 → 2575.24] especially even as we're celebrating with cake,
[2575.30 → 2576.62] there are so many reasons to celebrate,
[2576.82 → 2579.56] I encourage you to grab Cole and Natasha
[2579.56 → 2581.36] to welcome them in the Lord
[2581.36 → 2583.54] and to greet them in Jesus' name together.
[2583.74 → 2584.98] Let's stand as we sing.
[2584.98 → 2585.06] Amen.
[2595.80 → 2613.20] Be Thou My Vision
[2613.20 → 2618.20] O Lord of my heart
[2618.20 → 2622.92] Not Thee all else to me
[2622.92 → 2627.02] Save that Thou art
[2627.02 → 2630.96] Thou my best thought
[2630.96 → 2636.02] By day or by night
[2636.02 → 2639.42] Waking or sleeping
[2639.42 → 2645.34] Thy presence my light
[2645.34 → 2655.10] Be Thou my wisdom
[2655.10 → 2660.10] Thou my true heart
[2660.10 → 2664.42] I ever with Thee
[2664.42 → 2668.76] And Thou with me Lord
[2668.76 → 2673.26] Thou my great Father
[2673.26 → 2677.78] I Thy true Son
[2677.78 → 2681.34] Thou in me dwelling
[2681.34 → 2685.44] And I with Thee one
[2685.44 → 2702.04] Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise
[2702.04 → 2710.58] Thou mine inheritance, now and always
[2710.58 → 2719.32] Thou and Thou only, first in my heart
[2719.32 → 2728.50] High King of Heaven, my treasure Thou art
[2728.50 → 2742.54] High King of Heaven, my victory won
[2742.54 → 2750.24] May I reach Heaven's joys, O bright Heaven's Son
[2750.24 → 2758.98] Heart of my own heart, whatever befall
[2758.98 → 2768.26] Still be my vision, O ruler of all
[2768.26 → 2775.98] Heart of my own heart, whatever befall
[2775.98 → 2785.98] Still be my vision, O ruler of all
[2785.98 → 2803.30] Good morning again.
[2804.38 → 2808.84] This morning we continue the giving of our gifts, our worship with the giving of our gifts,
[2809.24 → 2813.06] first to the ministry and mission of our church through the budget,
[2813.06 → 2817.72] and our special offering today is for World Renew Disaster Response.
[2818.70 → 2823.22] When disasters strike, World Renew responds to the urgent needs that arise,
[2823.74 → 2828.38] clearing up debris, assessing needs, providing emergency food, water and shelter,
[2828.94 → 2832.98] training local leaders and repairing and rebuilding homes.
[2833.78 → 2839.62] Communities around the world are impacted by natural disasters like floods, hurricanes and fires,
[2839.62 → 2843.34] as well as conflict, war and violence.
[2844.10 → 2847.20] These disasters cause serious disruption in communities,
[2847.60 → 2849.96] especially when people's homes are severely damaged.
[2851.54 → 2854.26] Recovery often takes months, even years.
[2855.04 → 2858.68] These disasters not only have a tremendous impact on communities physically,
[2858.90 → 2864.20] but they are likely to have drastic and long-lasting effects on the emotional and mental health of its members.
[2864.20 → 2870.36] Giving financially is one way to support these efforts and is so needed and appreciated.
[2871.32 → 2875.92] Another option is to volunteer time and energy at a disaster site.
[2875.92 → 2880.74] I know some members of this congregation in years past have volunteered,
[2881.18 → 2883.26] and the experience has been very impactful.
[2883.26 → 2888.22] By supporting the work of World Renew and the Disaster Response Services,
[2888.22 → 2892.52] you give new life to communities impacted by disaster.
[2892.52 → 2919.00] Lord, I want to be a sacrifice.
[2919.00 → 2927.16] Lord, I want to be pleasing to you.
[2927.16 → 2936.24] Lord, I want your love to rule my life.
[2936.24 → 2942.82] And be the one that you shine through.
[2942.82 → 2950.82] Jesus, I give you hope.
[2950.82 → 2958.82] Every part of me cries out your name.
[2958.82 → 2966.82] Jesus, I give you hope.
[2966.82 → 2996.80] Lord, I want your love to rule my life.
[2996.80 → 3003.80] Lord, I want your love to rule my life.
[3003.80 → 3011.80] And be the one that you shine through.
[3011.80 → 3019.80] Jesus, I give you hope.
[3019.80 → 3026.80] Every part of me cries out your name.
[3026.80 → 3032.80] Jesus, I give you hope.
[3032.80 → 3037.80] Jesus, I give you hope.
[3037.80 → 3047.80] Living and holy, living and holy, living and holy, living and holy, living and holy for you.
[3047.80 → 3052.80] Jesus, I give you hope.
[3052.80 → 3059.80] Jesus, I give you hope.
[3059.80 → 3061.80] Jesus, I give you hope.
[3061.80 → 3063.80] Every part of me cries out your name.
[3063.80 → 3065.80] Jesus, I give you hope.
[3065.80 → 3067.80] Jesus, I give you hope.
[3067.80 → 3071.80] Jesus, I give you hope.
[3071.80 → 3087.08] Living and holy, living and holy, living and holy, living and holy for you.
[3087.08 → 3102.14] All right, kids, come on down to the front.
[3102.38 → 3103.50] We're going to have a little kids' corner.
[3103.54 → 3104.92] Maybe not so close to the front.
[3104.98 → 3106.44] I want to be able to see you still.
[3107.22 → 3107.90] There we go.
[3107.98 → 3108.56] There we go.
[3108.68 → 3109.60] How's everybody doing?
[3110.46 → 3111.52] We've got more coming.
[3111.62 → 3115.20] All kids age three to grade four, you can come on down.
[3115.20 → 3117.84] We still have a lot of kids here.
[3117.98 → 3122.06] There's a few missing from Gems, but we have a lot of kids here.
[3122.08 → 3122.96] How's everybody doing?
[3123.80 → 3124.24] Good.
[3125.70 → 3126.90] Are we missing someone?
[3127.70 → 3128.82] We're missing Hank.
[3129.10 → 3133.44] I think you guys all need to shout, come on out, Hank, and maybe he'll come.
[3133.82 → 3134.80] One, two, three, go.
[3137.30 → 3137.70] Whoa.
[3141.46 → 3142.88] Hank, you were flying.
[3142.88 → 3143.40] Wow.
[3144.16 → 3145.40] What a rush.
[3146.10 → 3148.52] It's so good to see you all.
[3148.76 → 3149.64] How are you doing, Hank?
[3149.92 → 3151.04] I'm great.
[3151.54 → 3152.28] Wow, really?
[3152.64 → 3154.86] Yeah, I had that best week ever.
[3155.32 → 3156.44] What did you do, Hank?
[3156.80 → 3162.40] I went to my Uncle Wrinkle's house, and I helped take care of his sheep.
[3162.66 → 3163.08] Really?
[3163.32 → 3164.72] Yeah, he's a sheepdog.
[3164.98 → 3165.76] A sheepdog?
[3165.92 → 3167.84] He looks like me, but he herds sheep.
[3168.20 → 3169.84] Well, that's fun, and you got to help him out?
[3169.98 → 3171.28] I've never done it before.
[3171.28 → 3173.30] Well, what did he ask you to do?
[3173.56 → 3176.58] He said, Hank, take care of the sheep.
[3177.10 → 3177.76] That's fun.
[3178.12 → 3182.06] Well, I thought he meant, like, take care of the sheep, and they look delicious.
[3182.06 → 3185.00] So they kind of look like marshmallows.
[3185.28 → 3190.58] But when I went out there and tried to take a bite, Hank, that's what Uncle Wrinkle said.
[3191.38 → 3194.62] And then I learned, oh, I'm supposed to take care of the sheep.
[3194.94 → 3195.86] So you know what I did?
[3196.04 → 3196.86] What did you do, Hank?
[3197.12 → 3198.94] I thought they might want breakfast.
[3199.50 → 3203.70] So I cooked up a pound of bacon, and then I ate it.
[3203.70 → 3208.32] And then I plucked up another pound of bacon, and I ate that one, too.
[3208.66 → 3211.56] And then Uncle Wrinkle said, stop wasting the bacon.
[3211.70 → 3215.44] So I plucked up one more pound, and I brought it out to the sheep.
[3215.76 → 3216.74] And do you know what I learned?
[3218.10 → 3219.64] Sheep don't eat bacon.
[3220.48 → 3222.98] They're not a big fan of breakfast meats.
[3222.98 → 3229.04] So I ate the pound of bacon, and then I learned that they like to eat grass.
[3229.34 → 3234.36] So I helped lead them to some grass, and they ate, and they were so happy.
[3234.70 → 3237.32] And then I just got to watch them, and it was the best weekend.
[3237.50 → 3239.78] That's what taking care of sheep means.
[3240.12 → 3241.48] That's what I learned anyway.
[3241.90 → 3242.68] Well, that's fun.
[3242.90 → 3245.14] Do you know what we're going to do in children's worship time today?
[3245.78 → 3249.92] We're going to learn about what Jesus said to his disciples about taking care of sheep.
[3250.58 → 3251.20] You have a question?
[3251.20 → 3251.50] Yeah.
[3252.98 → 3256.06] I don't know why Hank talks silly.
[3256.16 → 3257.30] Hank, why do you talk silly?
[3257.42 → 3258.42] I don't really know.
[3258.70 → 3263.24] This was the voice that was chosen for me on a whim, and I kind of regret it.
[3263.46 → 3265.38] But it's what we're stuck with now.
[3266.18 → 3267.06] That's kind of why.
[3267.26 → 3267.62] Yeah.
[3268.60 → 3269.10] All right.
[3269.28 → 3272.72] So we're going to go to children's worship time, and you can ask me questions there, okay?
[3272.86 → 3275.32] And then we'll talk more about what it means to take care of sheep.
[3275.36 → 3277.36] But we're going to pray, and then we're going to do the Lord's blessing, okay?
[3277.58 → 3278.20] Sounds good.
[3278.30 → 3278.54] All right.
[3278.56 → 3278.92] Let's pray.
[3278.92 → 3280.26] Let's bow our heads and close our eyes.
[3281.14 → 3282.62] Dear God, thank you so much for this day.
[3282.62 → 3286.06] Thank you that we could be here in church today and learn more about what it means to
[3286.06 → 3286.60] follow you.
[3286.76 → 3290.50] And as we go off to children's worship time and the grown-ups stay back here, God, we
[3290.50 → 3294.64] will all learn more about the word and what it means to be a disciple of Christ.
[3294.84 → 3296.34] We pray this all in your name.
[3296.80 → 3297.16] Amen.
[3297.76 → 3298.00] All right.
[3298.02 → 3298.66] Let's stand up.
[3298.66 → 3301.88] We're going to do the children's blessing together, okay?
[3301.92 → 3304.24] We're going to say, the Lord be with you at the same time.
[3304.32 → 3305.16] Boys, not too fast.
[3306.30 → 3306.62] Ready?
[3307.26 → 3308.28] One, two, three.
[3308.28 → 3332.50] Good morning.
[3332.50 → 3336.50] My name is Ken, and I'm an elder here at Emanuel Church.
[3336.50 → 3340.34] And this morning, I will be leading us into our church family prayer.
[3340.68 → 3345.86] So let's turn our hearts to the Lord and reach out to him together.
[3346.64 → 3347.44] Let's pray.
[3347.44 → 3353.88] Our Father in heaven, holy, holy are you, Lord God Almighty.
[3354.76 → 3358.72] Worthy is the Lamb to receive all glory, honour, and praise.
[3359.40 → 3364.48] We are grateful, Lord, that you are always present, always loving, and always caring.
[3364.96 → 3369.28] And we humbly approach your throne of grace with confidence this morning, Lord Jesus.
[3369.28 → 3399.26] Lord, we confess.
[3399.28 → 3404.02] That there are so many times when we try to take control of our lives and stop trusting you.
[3404.76 → 3410.10] And there are times, Lord, where we try to replace faith with logic and our limited understanding.
[3410.92 → 3414.12] Correct our vision, Lord, and help us fix our eyes on Jesus.
[3415.42 → 3417.32] For now we know and see in part.
[3418.02 → 3421.64] But when completeness comes, we will come to fully know your works, Lord.
[3422.44 → 3428.10] We trust that our lack of understanding today does not change that you are at work in all things.
[3428.10 → 3430.78] And so we lift all things to you today, Lord.
[3430.98 → 3432.40] Our joys and our sorrows.
[3432.84 → 3437.20] Our celebrations and our pains within our church, our families, and our communities.
[3438.36 → 3443.64] Lord, we don't understand when health fails in our loved ones.
[3444.14 → 3445.88] But we put our hope and trust in you.
[3446.72 → 3452.70] Lord, we lift the Skipper family in this time of grief and loss with the passing of Matthew's wife, Rachel.
[3452.70 → 3456.30] Lord, she has struggled and suffered for so long.
[3456.64 → 3461.34] And we are thankful that she is with you with no more pain but basking in your glory.
[3462.06 → 3469.92] But, Lord, we still grieve deeply for the many years of failing health and for the loss of a wife, a mother, a daughter, and a friend.
[3469.92 → 3477.58] Lord, please be near to Matt and the kids, to John and Fran, Dave and Sheila, and to all the other family and friends who are in mourning.
[3479.10 → 3486.14] And, Lord, we lift Tanya Tastemaker and her family as the cancer in her body has advanced, and she is receiving hospice-level care now.
[3487.08 → 3491.30] Lord, give her comfort and peace in the knowledge that you are with her always.
[3491.30 → 3496.68] Lord, we lift all those dealing with cancer, including Tessa and Doug.
[3497.44 → 3507.48] And, Lord, we pray for Clary's sister, Joan, and her family as she deals with fatigue and effects of a round of radiation treatment and waits to see whether it was effective.
[3509.02 → 3515.50] Lord, we don't understand when tragic events happen in our world, and we see devastating pain and heartbreak.
[3516.06 → 3520.80] Lord, we think of the horrific events this week at the Lap-Lapu Day Festival in Vancouver.
[3521.30 → 3523.76] So many lives were lost and changed forever.
[3524.56 → 3527.62] And, God, we pray for those affected and touched by this tragedy.
[3528.10 → 3534.48] And we ask for your nearness to the Filipino community as they rally together in shock, mourning, and in grief.
[3536.00 → 3539.32] Lord, we also lift our joys and celebrations to you.
[3539.98 → 3545.12] Despite our sinful nature, you shower us with grace and blessings beyond our understanding.
[3545.48 → 3547.18] And we are thankful to you, Lord.
[3547.18 → 3551.52] Lord, we praise you with Eli and Emily Alexander who were married here yesterday.
[3552.18 → 3554.06] What a blessing you have poured out on them.
[3554.82 → 3564.18] Lord, we pray that their marriage will be centred in you in times when the direction you are leading them is obvious and in times that are hard to understand.
[3564.18 → 3573.90] Lord, we pray for all of our marriages that they would be an image of Christ's sacrificial love for the church and the church fully serving Christ.
[3574.64 → 3580.10] Lord, as we see John and Elsa celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary, what an amazing gift.
[3580.64 → 3585.92] And, Lord, we praise you for their long marriage and for all the blessing you have poured out on them.
[3585.92 → 3591.84] And each of the members of our church who have had marriages that have lasted decades and decades.
[3592.86 → 3599.58] Lord, we're joyful to celebrate the new members, Cole and Natasha, as they have joined our church family.
[3599.86 → 3602.98] And Adrian, as he was baptized as one of your covenant children.
[3603.74 → 3607.90] Your promises never fail, Lord, and we stand in awe and celebrate together.
[3607.90 → 3612.74] And, Lord, we thank you that the Gems have been having a great time at camp.
[3613.08 → 3616.62] And we pray that you be with them as they worship together in Maple Ridge this morning.
[3617.22 → 3622.82] And, Lord, as they're getting to share and grow in knowledge and faith in you in new ways, work in their hearts.
[3623.46 → 3632.34] As the Gems camp is wrapping up and the girls and leaders head home, we pray for their safe return and that you would continue to work and grow in each of their lives.
[3633.40 → 3637.40] Lord, we lift Emmanuel Church, its ministries, and the church leaders.
[3637.90 → 3640.82] We pray for your leading as new elders and deacons are called.
[3641.60 → 3647.46] Lord, we ask that you work through the process to draw out individuals that you are calling to serve in this capacity.
[3648.02 → 3652.58] And we pray that you place your guiding hand on the council meeting happening this week.
[3653.96 → 3657.18] We pray, God, for our country and our government leaders.
[3657.46 → 3664.18] As we have elected a new federal government, Lord, we acknowledge that all authority in heaven and on earth comes from you alone.
[3664.18 → 3670.00] Lord, please work through our government and leaders at all levels to bring forth your kingdom.
[3670.74 → 3677.32] And, Lord, just as we sang, we want to be a sacrifice, pleasing to you, living and holy for you.
[3677.98 → 3679.64] Help us live for you alone.
[3680.22 → 3685.52] In our lack of understanding of so many things, Lord, we have certainty in you, Lord Jesus,
[3685.90 → 3690.76] with faith that allows us to be sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.
[3690.76 → 3692.06] Thank you, Jesus.
[3692.48 → 3693.34] In your name we pray.
[3693.70 → 3693.98] Amen.
[3693.98 → 3694.10] Amen.
[3694.10 → 3694.12] Amen.
[3694.12 → 3694.14] Amen.
[3694.14 → 3694.58] Amen.
[3694.58 → 3694.64] Amen.
[3694.64 → 3695.14] Amen.
[3695.14 → 3696.14] Amen.
[3696.14 → 3700.52] Amen.
[3700.52 → 3701.32] Amen.
[3701.32 → 3701.52] Amen.
[3701.52 → 3702.48] Amen.
[3702.48 → 3726.12] I just say before we continue here, it is, at least to my heart and to my soul, so good,
[3726.12 → 3734.30] to be with you in worship this week and to gather again. I don't know what your past week has been
[3734.30 → 3739.34] like and the kinds of things that are happening in your life, in your heart, in your minds, and
[3739.34 → 3748.20] around you, but there just seems to me those times and those circumstances, those events in our lives
[3748.20 → 3755.76] that just weigh down, that feel a little heavier, that are sometimes a little bit more difficult to
[3755.76 → 3761.84] carry, and there are sometimes in our lives where we're just not sure what's going on or why it's
[3761.84 → 3768.88] happening, and it's in both of those moments where I think it's good to gather together, right? There
[3768.88 → 3774.92] are times in our lives where tragedy strikes, and we cry out to God, and we just don't know how to hold
[3774.92 → 3780.02] the weight of it, and that's a reason to gather. There are times in our lives where we've got more
[3780.02 → 3785.26] celebrations going on around us than we can manage in our times and in our schedules, and we're singing
[3785.26 → 3795.12] for joy, and that's a reason to gather. And so whatever it is for you this week, and as it has
[3795.12 → 3805.02] been for me, a week of chaos and confusion, it's so good to gather and to once again centre our hearts
[3805.02 → 3811.88] and our minds on the Lord Jesus and to once again open his word and to hear his voice to our hearts.
[3811.88 → 3817.44] And so that's what we're going to do for the next little while together. Open the word of God, hear his
[3817.44 → 3826.38] voice to our hearts for encouragement and for celebration, for sustaining power, and for his very
[3826.38 → 3835.94] presence among us. I'm going to read from 1 Thessalonians 5. We, for a while now, have been working our way
[3835.94 → 3842.52] through the books of Thessalonians for Easter and for gems. We've kind of taken a pause, but we're now
[3842.52 → 3851.68] returning to the last few verses of 1 Thessalonians 5. I'm going to read verses 23 through 28. The first
[3851.68 → 3856.86] time through, it will be on the screen behind me, but we will refer back, and so I encourage you, if you
[3856.86 → 3861.82] have a Bible, to open it up, or if you have one on your phone, to look up the text and keep it there.
[3861.82 → 3866.02] If you'd like a Bible, there's some available at the back. You can grab one from the back.
[3867.32 → 3871.62] If you don't have a Bible, and if you don't have a Bible at home, grab one from the back and take
[3871.62 → 3877.04] it home. We would love to bless you with that. But let's open God's word and read together.
[3877.04 → 3890.54] May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit,
[3890.94 → 3898.58] soul, and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. The one who calls you is
[3898.58 → 3909.44] faithful, and he will do it. Brothers and sisters, pray for us. Greet all God's people with a holy kiss.
[3910.12 → 3915.18] I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers and sisters.
[3916.16 → 3921.76] The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. This is the word of the Lord.
[3921.76 → 3936.28] Into moments like these, and that is inclusive of everything that you bring into worship today.
[3936.42 → 3949.12] Into moments like these, God speaks to us through his word. And the theme or the big idea for this
[3949.12 → 3957.60] morning that comes out of this scripture text is the blessing of God as the promise of God to bring
[3957.60 → 3962.58] you closer to God. Although at least that's what it was when I was preparing for this, and I realized
[3962.58 → 3969.86] just how convoluted that sounds, and how difficult that is to understand. And so instead, really simply,
[3970.20 → 3978.92] God does what he says he will do. And God says he will carry you through. God does what he says he
[3978.92 → 3988.24] will do, and he says that he will carry you through. At the end of this first letter to the church in
[3988.24 → 3998.38] Thessalonica, Paul closes with a prayer. Now throughout this whole letter, his desire has been to encourage
[3998.38 → 4004.86] these faithful Christians in the face of their own struggles and hardships with faith, to encourage
[4004.86 → 4011.14] them in the face of opposition from the governing authorities in Thessalonica, to encourage them to
[4011.14 → 4016.72] grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, to grow in their faith and to
[4016.72 → 4026.92] become more like Jesus, in living in more and more in ever-increasing obedience to his call on their life
[4026.92 → 4032.92] because of their new faith. And the word that we have learned and that we have used, because Paul
[4032.92 → 4041.04] has been using it, the word for that is sanctification. And to be sanctified means to be set apart for God's
[4041.04 → 4048.10] purposes. It means to live as one set apart, to grow in our looking like disciples of Jesus.
[4048.10 → 4059.38] That's all it is, to grow, to look more like Jesus. And Paul prays now that that growth would continue
[4059.38 → 4068.84] in them right through to the end. And in fact, this prayer is a sort of guarantee of God's promise to be
[4068.84 → 4074.78] present and part of shaping you so that you make it to the end. We read,
[4074.78 → 4081.42] May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. We're talking about God
[4081.42 → 4088.92] here, God himself. And God has revealed himself to us as a Father through the Son by the work of the
[4088.92 → 4097.10] Holy Spirit. And God has sanctified you and will make it go through and through. That's his promise to us.
[4097.10 → 4110.38] God does what he says he will do. And through and through just means all of your life, into every
[4110.38 → 4117.10] aspect of your being. There's no part of you that isn't transformed by God's grace.
[4117.10 → 4126.68] We don't get to hold things back, even though we try. We try to hold things back from God. We try to
[4126.68 → 4132.86] hang on to a little piece of our former selves. We pretend that we have a measure of control
[4132.86 → 4139.44] and that we can keep that secret. But the truth of the gospel, the truth of his transformation,
[4139.44 → 4149.08] right, is that it's all of me for all of him. And in that way, sanctification, looking more like Jesus,
[4149.62 → 4158.66] starts with submission. Now, I've said this before. I think it's helpful for us. Part of what it means
[4158.66 → 4168.36] to be Christian is to trust God more than you trust yourself. It means to submit to God's will in place
[4168.36 → 4175.26] of your will. Deeper yet, it means to have your will transformed, your heart transformed, so that
[4175.26 → 4183.36] your desires become God's desires, so that you love what God loves. Part of being Christian is a
[4183.36 → 4194.66] continual submission of your life to who God is. And to be completely honest with you, that's not easy.
[4194.66 → 4202.92] Jesus promised us, in this world you will have trouble. We read, anyone who desires to live a
[4202.92 → 4209.50] godly life in Christ will be persecuted. Being a Christian, one of the word pairings we get in the
[4209.50 → 4213.98] New Testament, that being a Christian will make you strangers and aliens in the world.
[4213.98 → 4227.68] It's hard. And it's harder the more you grow. But there's good news. Because even though it's hard,
[4228.72 → 4239.28] it is good. It is good. It is so good. There is nothing that compares to the love of God,
[4239.28 → 4244.50] your father. There's nothing that compares to being known by the person of God. There's nothing
[4244.50 → 4253.68] that matches being a lavishly loved child of the Father. We read, I have made you and I will carry you,
[4253.78 → 4260.74] I will sustain you, and I will rescue you. There is nothing that can separate you from the love of God
[4260.74 → 4268.94] that is available in Christ Jesus our Lord. Again, do not fear, for I have redeemed you, God says. I have
[4268.94 → 4277.68] summoned you by name. You are mine. This is such a good identity for us.
[4279.02 → 4286.98] Better than whatever else the world might offer. And in fact, the world is going to try to subtly force an identity
[4286.98 → 4293.46] on you. And I want you to hear that intentionally. Subtly force. Those sound like oxymoronic word pairs,
[4293.56 → 4299.02] but they're not. Because it's a forceful thing that happens without most of us even realizing it.
[4300.10 → 4305.86] It's not something we choose, but it's something we live out of. And the world is going to subtly force
[4305.86 → 4312.28] an identity on you. It's going to want to shape you in a particular way. And sin and the flesh and the devil
[4312.28 → 4318.70] are all going to want you to think a certain way about what it means to be you. A certain way about
[4318.70 → 4325.02] what it means to live in this world. And it can be so easy for us to move down that road.
[4326.44 → 4332.38] But what I hope we can hear and see, I hope our hearts begin to glimpse that the identity that is
[4332.38 → 4342.82] bestowed on you by God is better by far. It is fixed in you by his grace, and he will hold you fast.
[4343.76 → 4350.36] This is the identity that is imaged for us in baptism this morning. This is the identity that
[4350.36 → 4358.00] is signed and sealed in the means of grace. And with that, we pray that your whole spirit,
[4358.00 → 4369.44] soul, and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Again, notice who's working in
[4369.44 → 4378.40] this text. Notice who's doing this work, who the actor is, right? May your whole spirit, soul, and body
[4378.40 → 4387.82] be kept blameless. God is doing the keeping. God is the subject. He is the agent of the first
[4387.82 → 4393.42] line of this prayer, and he's the subject or the agent of the second line of this prayer. And you
[4393.42 → 4401.66] are the recipient of his keeping. And again, in that phrase, spirit, soul, and body, it's just another
[4401.66 → 4410.76] way of saying your whole selves, all of you for all of him. This is God's promise to you. It's about the
[4410.76 → 4417.04] whole process from beginning to end, from the moment of your salvation to the fulfillment of your
[4417.04 → 4424.30] salvation at the return of Jesus Christ. Our whole lives, in fact, are oriented, are directed, are lived,
[4424.56 → 4433.06] facing forward to his future return. The God of peace has reoriented your life towards his goals
[4433.06 → 4440.72] and his purposes. We live faces fixed on the future return of Christ, and when our faces are fixed on
[4440.72 → 4449.44] the future return of Christ, we're called to live in line with that fixation. Based on the work of God,
[4450.32 → 4458.66] this prayer, then, is a call to comprehensive Christian living. It's a call to live drawing
[4458.66 → 4465.54] closer and closer and closer to God in faith and in faithfulness, in trust and in obedience.
[4469.14 → 4469.70] Sometimes,
[4470.26 → 4480.12] sometimes we feel stuck in our faith, right? And when we feel stuck in our faith, it's really easy to give up.
[4480.12 → 4488.36] Sometimes we feel like we just can't experience God in the way that we want to, and so we become apathetic.
[4491.72 → 4498.48] Sometimes we think, I'm not really getting anything out of it, and so I'm not going to put anything into it.
[4500.24 → 4506.72] And to be candid, sometimes we just get lazy with our faith. I'm guilty of that.
[4506.72 → 4515.58] Can I confess that with you this morning? I'm guilty of being lazy with my faith.
[4517.48 → 4524.54] But this prayer of Paul is not just for the church in Thessalonica. It's a prayer of Paul for you and for me.
[4525.34 → 4532.26] This is a call to push through and to press in. This is a call to persevere in faith because we're being preserved in faith.
[4532.26 → 4540.28] This is a call to remember our identities in Christ Jesus, sanctified through and through.
[4540.38 → 4545.28] This is a call to actually trust God more than I trust myself.
[4546.28 → 4549.68] To really believe that He is good,
[4550.68 → 4553.78] and that in Him is the true, the good, and the beautiful.
[4553.92 → 4557.94] That in Him is the truest, and the best, and the most beautiful.
[4557.94 → 4562.54] And in this is also a promise.
[4564.20 → 4566.18] Right? God does what He says He will do.
[4567.20 → 4569.14] And He will carry you through.
[4570.68 → 4571.98] What did we read? We read,
[4572.78 → 4578.08] The one who calls you is faithful, and He will do it.
[4579.36 → 4581.98] This is like an amen in prayer.
[4581.98 → 4589.16] Some of you are new to faith and are new to taking faith seriously,
[4589.40 → 4590.72] and so you're learning how to pray.
[4591.06 → 4595.46] One of the first things we learn when we pray is that prayers end by saying,
[4595.70 → 4598.24] In Jesus' name, amen.
[4598.66 → 4599.28] Very good.
[4600.00 → 4600.98] Some of you know how to pray.
[4601.90 → 4603.42] But honestly, that's all it takes.
[4603.86 → 4605.38] That's all it takes to know how to pray.
[4605.54 → 4606.76] In Jesus' name, amen.
[4606.76 → 4613.78] This line, the one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it, is an amen.
[4614.38 → 4617.52] The word amen simply means, let it be so.
[4618.38 → 4621.64] Amen means, I believe you are faithful, and you will do it.
[4622.68 → 4624.68] So when you pray amen, you're saying,
[4624.80 → 4626.96] God, I know you can do this.
[4627.80 → 4630.08] And so I trust you to do it.
[4631.24 → 4632.32] Paul prays,
[4632.32 → 4635.78] May the God of peace then sanctify you through and through.
[4635.78 → 4637.28] That is, may he make you holy.
[4637.40 → 4639.44] May he set you apart in everything.
[4639.96 → 4643.18] And may he carry you through to the end, to the fulfillment,
[4643.34 → 4648.22] so that in him, in everything, and in every way, you are set apart.
[4648.56 → 4650.64] You are holy in his name.
[4650.90 → 4651.64] And then he prays,
[4651.70 → 4655.00] May your whole spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless.
[4655.10 → 4655.68] And then again, that is,
[4656.02 → 4661.58] May all of you, every thought, every imagination, every love, every desire,
[4661.58 → 4668.14] every will, every action, and every reaction, be blameless, and holy, and pure.
[4669.60 → 4670.64] And he prays,
[4671.16 → 4674.72] The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it.
[4676.00 → 4678.38] Again, notice the language carefully.
[4678.52 → 4678.72] It says,
[4678.88 → 4680.82] The one who calls you, right?
[4681.04 → 4684.08] It is a present, ongoing reality.
[4685.08 → 4685.64] It doesn't say,
[4685.64 → 4686.94] The one who called you,
[4687.34 → 4687.56] It says,
[4687.62 → 4688.90] The one who calls you.
[4689.30 → 4691.60] He continues to call.
[4691.70 → 4693.12] He didn't call you and then say,
[4693.22 → 4694.16] Go figure it out.
[4695.22 → 4695.44] Right?
[4695.48 → 4697.24] He didn't show you the way and then say,
[4697.34 → 4698.82] Now walk in it and then just leave.
[4700.00 → 4700.20] Right?
[4700.22 → 4701.12] He's calling you.
[4701.20 → 4704.14] He's actively walking with you.
[4704.52 → 4705.58] He's calling you.
[4705.68 → 4709.80] He's actively walking alongside and in you by his spirit.
[4709.80 → 4713.78] He's calling you, and he carries you through.
[4714.44 → 4716.98] He calls, and he walks with you.
[4717.06 → 4718.26] That's sanctifying.
[4719.26 → 4721.80] That's the whole self, blameless living.
[4722.70 → 4722.80] Right?
[4722.82 → 4724.36] He doesn't just show you the way.
[4724.72 → 4727.36] He walks in it with you and through you.
[4728.32 → 4731.32] And this truth is written all over the pages of Scripture.
[4734.08 → 4735.18] In Philippians,
[4735.18 → 4743.08] In Corinthians, we read,
[4743.48 → 4746.18] He will also keep you firm to the end
[4746.18 → 4749.40] so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[4750.62 → 4750.76] Right?
[4750.86 → 4752.04] God will do it.
[4752.80 → 4756.26] And he invites you to do it with him,
[4756.42 → 4758.38] to cooperate with the Holy Spirit.
[4759.02 → 4759.90] In Hebrews 13,
[4759.90 → 4765.10] Now may the God of peace equip you with everything good for doing his will.
[4765.74 → 4768.52] He equips you with everything good for doing his will,
[4768.72 → 4770.56] and then he invites you to go do it.
[4771.80 → 4772.08] Right?
[4772.12 → 4773.98] Another place that we can look to,
[4774.10 → 4774.80] Philippians 2.
[4774.90 → 4775.90] This is one of my favourite.
[4776.42 → 4776.92] Paul writes,
[4777.06 → 4778.50] Therefore, my dear friends,
[4778.80 → 4782.98] continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling.
[4783.66 → 4783.84] Right?
[4783.90 → 4785.18] Work it out continually.
[4785.64 → 4787.42] Do it and keep doing it.
[4787.76 → 4791.44] For it is God who works in you to will and to act
[4791.44 → 4795.02] in order to fulfill his good purposes.
[4795.18 → 4797.36] Here's the thing.
[4798.26 → 4799.46] Here's what all that means.
[4800.06 → 4800.16] Right?
[4800.30 → 4802.12] God's promise is a guarantee.
[4802.82 → 4805.24] And God's promise is an invitation.
[4806.88 → 4808.70] God does what he says he will do,
[4808.80 → 4811.62] and he says he will carry you through.
[4812.72 → 4816.58] And the life of one being carried looks a particular way.
[4816.58 → 4820.12] I want to illustrate this idea with you,
[4820.16 → 4822.84] and I'm going to use an image borrowed from Michael Horton.
[4824.22 → 4828.42] Sometimes we think of the Christian life like a raft.
[4828.42 → 4828.86] Right?
[4830.06 → 4835.00] Where we just float along in the ocean of life.
[4835.96 → 4837.96] We go along with the current,
[4838.36 → 4843.82] hoping that God does everything without any real participation on our part.
[4844.70 → 4845.22] Right?
[4845.28 → 4847.80] And this is a passive approach.
[4847.80 → 4852.86] It very easily and possibly becomes an apathetic approach.
[4853.68 → 4855.26] Some people have called this,
[4855.62 → 4857.60] the reality of this for the Christian person,
[4857.82 → 4859.56] the idea of being frozen chosen.
[4860.38 → 4860.60] Right?
[4860.60 → 4862.22] That God has selected you,
[4862.26 → 4863.48] and now you just sit back and wait.
[4864.48 → 4865.44] You're stuck right there.
[4865.98 → 4868.48] Kevin calls this covenant child syndrome.
[4869.68 → 4870.16] Right?
[4870.20 → 4873.66] And it's the wrong idea that because of God's election and providence,
[4873.76 → 4876.64] I don't have to cooperate with his spirit to live a transformed life.
[4877.12 → 4877.34] Right?
[4877.36 → 4878.68] I don't have to live a certain way.
[4878.86 → 4880.32] I don't have to join him on mission.
[4880.62 → 4881.88] I'm just along for this ride,
[4881.96 → 4882.82] whatever it looks like.
[4884.68 → 4885.68] That's the wrong idea.
[4886.38 → 4889.52] There's another wrong idea that's maybe more common to some of us here.
[4889.98 → 4892.64] Sometimes we think of this relationship,
[4892.64 → 4895.52] this idea like a canoe or like a rowboat.
[4896.38 → 4896.74] Right?
[4896.82 → 4899.76] Where it's all your effort to paddle the boat.
[4900.78 → 4904.04] And we know that rowing hard takes strength and discipline,
[4904.42 → 4906.18] and if you're with people, a lot of yelling.
[4908.46 → 4909.86] And this is legalism.
[4910.80 → 4911.00] Right?
[4911.04 → 4911.90] This is moralism.
[4912.32 → 4913.86] This is the wrong idea that,
[4913.98 → 4916.14] yeah, sure, grace gets me in,
[4916.30 → 4919.24] but it's my effort that keeps me on the straight and narrow.
[4921.12 → 4922.24] This one is heavy.
[4922.78 → 4923.94] This one is hard.
[4924.94 → 4928.40] And this one burdens our souls with a new yoke of slavery.
[4929.26 → 4929.36] Right?
[4929.36 → 4933.80] This is the one where we end up pretending that we have it all together on the outside
[4933.80 → 4937.98] because if I were to ever reveal the truth of what's going on in my heart to you,
[4938.10 → 4941.98] I'd be terrified that you would reject me because I'm not perfect like I pretend to be.
[4941.98 → 4946.50] If people knew how I really struggled with sin,
[4947.14 → 4949.46] they wouldn't think I'm Christian anymore.
[4950.60 → 4951.04] Right?
[4951.06 → 4953.18] That's down the line of this way of thinking.
[4953.18 → 4960.52] Instead, a more faithful way to think about this is like a sailboat.
[4961.92 → 4962.48] Right?
[4962.56 → 4964.02] We hoist the sails.
[4964.60 → 4966.00] That's our active involvement.
[4966.42 → 4969.22] And our active involvement is the means of grace.
[4969.44 → 4969.60] Right?
[4969.64 → 4971.52] It is submitting to the preached word.
[4971.64 → 4974.82] It is participating in the Lord's Supper and receiving baptism.
[4974.82 → 4982.42] Our involvement in hoisting the sails is the means of grace and obedience and prayer and worship and service.
[4982.64 → 4987.72] We hoist these sails, but it is the wind of the Holy Spirit that propels us forward.
[4989.10 → 4989.58] Right?
[4989.62 → 4994.28] It's the power of the Holy Spirit that moves us in the direction God is calling us to.
[4994.28 → 4997.02] That carries us towards the goal.
[4997.38 → 4997.46] Right?
[4997.50 → 5000.94] That carries us heavenward and the prize for which we have been saved.
[5001.28 → 5001.48] Right?
[5001.52 → 5005.58] That draws us to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[5007.00 → 5015.72] Hoist the sail and let the Spirit blow and take you in the path and journey of sanctification.
[5015.88 → 5019.86] The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it.
[5020.42 → 5023.74] God does what he says he will do, and he will carry you through.
[5023.74 → 5026.00] So hoist the sails of your obedience.
[5026.44 → 5028.74] Hoist the sails of worship and word.
[5028.94 → 5031.62] Hoist the sails of prayer and devotion.
[5031.92 → 5034.50] Hoist the sails of service and mission.
[5034.90 → 5037.06] And the Spirit of God will lead you.
[5037.14 → 5039.94] The power of God will propel you forward.
[5040.12 → 5043.18] Because that is what God has said he will do.
[5045.08 → 5050.54] If you ever doubt what God says he will do and that he does it, look to the cross.
[5052.46 → 5053.56] Look to the cross.
[5053.56 → 5061.82] Because way back in the very beginning, God promised that I will send one who will crush the head of the serpent.
[5062.82 → 5069.90] And over and over and over again as God told the story to his people and reminded them of who he is,
[5069.94 → 5072.64] of what it means to be their God and for them to be his people,
[5072.86 → 5076.78] God said, I will send one who will save you.
[5076.78 → 5083.76] I will send one who will keep perfectly the law and the commandments and all the things that I have told you to do.
[5083.92 → 5086.34] And you prove day in and day out that you cannot.
[5086.62 → 5088.34] I will do it.
[5088.34 → 5094.48] And so Jesus came and live the life we should have lived.
[5095.06 → 5098.12] Jesus came, and he died the death that we deserve.
[5098.12 → 5103.26] Jesus came and even though he was innocent, even though he died on that cross,
[5103.26 → 5107.74] he was raised three days later victorious over sin and death.
[5108.74 → 5114.10] He was raised having granted now for your newness of life.
[5114.96 → 5119.22] So that if you're united with him in his death, you can be united with him in his life.
[5119.22 → 5121.20] This is God's promise.
[5121.56 → 5123.76] He is faithful, and he will do it.
[5123.80 → 5124.48] And how do we know?
[5125.22 → 5126.50] Because he did it.
[5127.44 → 5128.20] It's done.
[5128.74 → 5129.76] It's finished.
[5131.18 → 5134.96] This is your reality now.
[5135.52 → 5139.72] And by grace, through faith, it becomes your identity.
[5141.16 → 5141.68] Right?
[5141.72 → 5147.74] That you are not your own, but that you belong body and soul and life and in death to your faithful Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[5147.74 → 5153.26] That he has set you free from the tyranny of the devil.
[5154.24 → 5160.60] And that now you are a lavishly loved child of the Father.
[5161.42 → 5163.18] This is who you are.
[5164.76 → 5169.82] And this, for us, is a promise and an invitation.
[5171.08 → 5172.20] A promise.
[5172.70 → 5175.02] This is true and an invitation.
[5175.02 → 5177.68] And so let's live like it is true.
[5178.64 → 5187.88] And then lastly, and very quickly, part of the promise and part of the invitation is that you are not alone.
[5188.90 → 5189.00] Right?
[5189.06 → 5190.50] Notice how Paul ends.
[5190.66 → 5193.56] He says, brothers and sisters, pray for us.
[5195.30 → 5199.48] He says, family of God, pray for one another.
[5200.04 → 5204.12] Pray for those who are journeying in faith, who are declaring the gospel.
[5204.12 → 5207.08] Pray for those who are having lives transformed.
[5207.28 → 5216.84] Pray for those who are moving from chaos to chaos and cannot understand how and why it is that God is allowing to happen to happen in this life and at this moment.
[5217.02 → 5218.70] But we pray for them.
[5219.08 → 5222.96] Brothers and sisters, God has given you a new family.
[5223.50 → 5226.46] This is part of our new identity.
[5226.46 → 5232.16] And that family functions a particular way.
[5232.60 → 5237.22] Now, bear with me, because I'm going to explain it after I read it, but I don't want you to jump to conclusions.
[5237.80 → 5239.66] Greet all God's people with a holy kiss.
[5239.66 → 5245.74] So don't turn to each other and start kissing unless you're married, and it's appropriate and your kids aren't too close.
[5248.24 → 5254.04] Our family is redefined by God's grace.
[5254.04 → 5265.30] And this mark of a holy kiss, this handshake and the peace of Christ be with you, this head nod, and the Lord be with you and also with you,
[5265.52 → 5269.54] this hug before worship is a marker of this new family.
[5270.78 → 5277.62] And so, if in our worship together at the beginning, when we say, turn to those around you and welcome them in worship,
[5277.62 → 5282.84] I really want to encourage you when we do that, don't just do that to your biological family.
[5283.92 → 5284.12] Right?
[5284.16 → 5286.86] Don't just turn to your kids and say, good morning.
[5287.60 → 5295.68] Turn to your blood-bought family and say, brother, sister, you are mine, and I am yours.
[5297.06 → 5297.48] Right?
[5297.52 → 5299.62] Maybe not a holy kiss, but a holy handshake.
[5300.84 → 5306.24] Something more is going on at this moment and in this group.
[5306.24 → 5309.62] It means you are not alone.
[5310.04 → 5312.26] You are never alone.
[5313.90 → 5318.56] I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers and sisters.
[5319.12 → 5327.18] The word of God as fuel for this promise and invitation as our defining peace together.
[5327.42 → 5329.24] And then one last promise.
[5330.24 → 5333.68] And after I read this, I invite you all together to say, amen.
[5333.68 → 5338.00] The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
[5338.92 → 5339.40] Amen.
[5340.10 → 5340.78] Let's pray.
[5340.78 → 5359.84] Lord Jesus Christ, blow in the power of the Holy Spirit that we might be transformed into the image of you, our Saviour.
[5359.84 → 5365.96] That we might rest sure in the promise of our new identity.
[5366.40 → 5370.88] And in that identity, we might see an invitation to love and serve.
[5371.80 → 5374.72] And that in that new identity, we might see a new family.
[5375.22 → 5380.58] A new community of people to walk this road of life and faith with us.
[5381.00 → 5383.56] Open our hearts, Lord God.
[5383.56 → 5387.76] That we might follow after your leading.
[5389.76 → 5396.06] And at this moment, as we have hoisted the sails of our obedience and of our coming to your word,
[5396.90 → 5402.66] may you blow us forward and out in the power of your Spirit
[5402.66 → 5407.88] so that we might declare the praises of him who has called us out of darkness into his wonderful light.
[5407.88 → 5412.68] May that be our anthem of faith this morning.
[5413.26 → 5416.98] Rooted in who you are and what you have done.
[5417.62 → 5419.36] In Jesus' name we pray.
[5420.40 → 5420.76] Amen.
[5421.70 → 5422.02] Amen.
[5422.02 → 5422.14] Amen.
[5422.14 → 5422.18] Amen.
[5422.18 → 5424.14] Amen.
[5424.14 → 5425.14] Amen.
[5425.14 → 5426.14] Amen.
[5426.14 → 5428.14] Amen.
[5428.14 → 5430.14] Amen.
[5430.14 → 5432.14] Amen.
[5432.14 → 5434.14] Amen.
[5434.14 → 5436.14] Amen.
[5436.14 → 5437.14] Amen.
[5437.14 → 5437.64] Amen.
[5437.64 → 5437.86] Amen.
[5437.88 → 5444.38] Amen.
[5444.38 → 5445.42] Amen.
[5445.42 → 5445.66] Amen.
[5445.66 → 5446.30] Amen.
[5446.30 → 5447.58] Amen.
[5447.58 → 5449.76] Amen.
[5449.76 → 5449.82] Amen.
[5449.82 → 5456.56] Be still, my soul, the Lord is on my side.
[5458.04 → 5458.42] Be still, my soul, the Lord is on my side.
[5458.42 → 5465.42] Bear patiently the cross of grief for pain.
[5465.42 → 5482.84] Leave to thy God to order and provide, in every change he is faithful will remain.
[5482.84 → 5500.84] Be still my soul, thy best, thy heavenly friend, through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.
[5500.84 → 5518.22] Be still my soul, thy God doth undertake, to guide the future as he has the past.
[5518.22 → 5535.20] Thy hope, thy confidence, let nothing shake, and thou mysterious shall be bright at last.
[5535.20 → 5550.94] Be still my soul, thy ways and winds still know, his voice to rule them while he dwelt below.
[5550.94 → 5568.60] In you rest, in you, I found my hope, in you, I trust, you never let me go.
[5568.60 → 5577.84] I place my life within your hands alone.
[5577.84 → 5592.84] Be still my soul, be still my soul, the hour is facing on.
[5592.84 → 5601.08] When we shall be forever with the Lord.
[5601.84 → 5608.84] When disappointment, grief and fear are gone.
[5608.84 → 5615.84] Sorrow for God, love's purest joys restored.
[5615.84 → 5624.84] Be still my soul, when change and tears are past.
[5624.84 → 5632.84] All safe and blessed, we shall meet at last.
[5632.84 → 5641.84] In you rest, in you, I found my hope.
[5641.84 → 5649.84] In you trust, you never let me go.
[5649.84 → 5658.84] I place my life within your hands alone.
[5658.84 → 5664.84] Be still my soul, be still my soul.
[5664.84 → 5669.84] In you rest, in you, I rest.
[5669.84 → 5673.84] In you found my hope.
[5673.84 → 5681.84] In you trust, you never let me go.
[5681.84 → 5693.84] I place my life within your hands alone.
[5693.84 → 5700.84] Be still my soul, be still my soul.
[5700.84 → 5705.84] Be still my soul.
[5705.84 → 5714.84] Be still my soul.
[5714.84 → 5742.84] Amen.
[5742.84 → 5749.84] Amen.
[5749.84 → 5755.84] As we go into this week, we do not go alone.
[5755.84 → 5759.84] But God himself goes with you.
[5759.84 → 5766.84] Into whatever circumstance you may face, God is with you.
[5766.84 → 5775.84] And so receive his blessing for the journey ahead.
[5775.84 → 5779.84] God go before you to lead you.
[5779.84 → 5782.84] God go behind you to protect you.
[5782.84 → 5785.84] God go beneath you to support you.
[5785.84 → 5788.84] God go beside you to befriend you.
[5788.84 → 5789.84] Do not be afraid.
[5789.84 → 5792.84] Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[5792.84 → 5794.84] Do not be afraid.
[5794.84 → 5797.84] The one who calls you is faithful.
[5797.84 → 5800.84] And he will do it.
[5800.84 → 5801.84] Amen.
[5801.84 → 5802.84] Amen.
[5802.84 → 5803.84] Amen.
[5803.84 → 5804.84] Amen.
[5804.84 → 5808.84] Amen.
