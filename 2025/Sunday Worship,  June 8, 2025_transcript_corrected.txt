[0.00 → 29.98] Thank you.
[30.00 → 59.98] Thank you.
[60.00 → 89.98] Thank you.
[90.00 → 119.98] Thank you.
[120.00 → 149.98] Thank you.
[150.00 → 152.00] Thank you.
[180.00 → 182.00] Thank you.
[210.00 → 212.00] Thank you.
[240.00 → 242.00] Thank you.
[242.00 → 244.00] Thank you.
[244.00 → 246.00] Thank you.
[246.00 → 248.00] Thank you.
[248.00 → 252.00] Thank you.
[252.00 → 261.14] I see a generation standing on the truth
[261.14 → 268.68] In each and every nation, God is on the moon
[268.68 → 273.08] Anytime the gospel stirs a searching soul
[273.08 → 277.50] And someone says, send me, here I go
[277.50 → 286.90] God is on the moon, on the moon, hallelujah
[286.90 → 291.48] God is on the moon in many, many ways
[291.48 → 295.86] God is on the moon, on the moon, hallelujah
[295.88 → 299.76] God is on the moon, on the moon today
[299.76 → 305.14] God is on the moon, on the moon, hallelujah
[305.14 → 309.46] God is on the move in many mighty ways.
[309.80 → 311.14] God is on the move.
[311.14 → 335.58] God is on the move.
[335.58 → 338.50] On the move today.
[341.14 → 355.72] God is on the move.
[371.14 → 373.16] Good morning.
[374.76 → 376.30] I love the excitement.
[376.50 → 378.12] I love the buzz in the room.
[378.30 → 380.66] Welcome to worship this morning.
[380.78 → 384.86] A special welcome if you are a visitor here with us.
[385.24 → 389.10] Today there's lots of celebration in our worship together.
[389.84 → 395.78] Not only are we celebrating Lord's Supper as we come to the table to receive from Jesus,
[395.78 → 401.98] his very presence in our lives, but also we are ordaining and installing new office bearers.
[402.12 → 406.62] And so if you're here as part of that celebration, thank you for joining with us.
[407.16 → 412.92] And then following our worship this morning, you might have seen on your way in some tables set up.
[412.92 → 419.62] We are celebrating with Andy and Rich Demons 50 years of marriage together.
[420.14 → 421.02] Amazing.
[424.30 → 431.16] And they have been so gracious with their family to provide cake and share in that celebration.
[431.16 → 435.58] And so if you weren't planning on sticking around following our worship this morning,
[435.66 → 439.02] maybe do for about five or ten minutes to make sure that you get a piece of cake,
[439.54 → 442.28] in part because they don't want to take all the leftovers home,
[442.46 → 444.58] because then Andy has to eat them all week long.
[444.64 → 446.32] And I'm not sure if that's what he wants to do either.
[446.32 → 451.24] As we worship together, as we do life together,
[451.24 → 454.42] there are a couple other announcements that we want to make this morning.
[455.24 → 461.40] And so first, I want to encourage you to keep your eye out in the midweek memo
[461.40 → 464.80] coming up for a couple of things that we're looking at.
[464.92 → 470.48] And so first, Reactivate, which is a youth conference that we host here in September,
[471.04 → 474.06] needs hundreds of volunteers to make it happen.
[474.06 → 477.48] And the sign-up sheet for that is going out this week.
[478.12 → 482.30] And so you'll be able to sign up for a couple places to serve
[482.30 → 489.10] and be with the youth that come from all over BC to be part of a conference here.
[489.92 → 495.10] As well, in this next week, you will see a save-the-date information card
[495.10 → 499.96] for an October 4th worship conference that we're going to be hosting here
[499.96 → 503.02] with Brian Dirk sen and Joshua Levinthal.
[503.02 → 511.34] And so they're going to be coming and having talks and worshipping with us in that time together.
[511.48 → 515.30] And so keep your eyes and ears open for more information on that.
[516.02 → 518.02] That's it for our announcements this morning.
[518.42 → 522.40] And so as you are making your way in or as you are seated there,
[522.44 → 524.56] I'm going to invite you to stand if you're able.
[524.56 → 529.08] And we can be called and ushered into God's presence together.
[530.02 → 534.14] I'm going to speak God's greeting over us as we gather in our worship.
[534.28 → 538.44] And I invite you to turn to those around you and welcome them in worship as well
[538.44 → 542.52] by passing the peace of Christ, saying the peace of Christ be with you or the Lord be with you,
[542.96 → 546.48] shaking their hands, nodding your heads, however it is you like to greet each other.
[546.74 → 547.56] Do that in this time.
[547.56 → 550.40] Receive the greeting of our good God.
[551.74 → 556.14] Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father,
[556.36 → 559.08] from the Lord Jesus Christ, His Son, and our Saviour,
[559.54 → 561.84] through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[562.64 → 562.92] Amen.
[562.92 → 563.06] Amen.
[563.06 → 563.10] Amen.
[563.10 → 563.12] Amen.
[577.56 → 601.10] Good morning.
[601.10 → 609.90] The biblical account of Pentecost is primarily found in the book of Acts, chapter 2.
[610.62 → 614.86] Key verses in Acts describe the event as a time of divine power
[614.86 → 617.54] and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit,
[617.80 → 622.30] empowering believers to speak in other languages and proclaim the gospel.
[623.18 → 626.76] Our call to worship this morning comes from Acts 2, verses 1 to 4.
[626.76 → 631.36] When the day of Pentecost came, they were together in one place.
[632.18 → 636.28] Suddenly, a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven
[636.28 → 639.46] and filled the whole house where they were sitting.
[640.08 → 646.06] They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them.
[646.90 → 649.20] All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit
[649.20 → 655.60] and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.
[656.76 → 658.66] Please join us in worship this morning.
[658.66 → 658.74] Amen.
[686.76 → 690.72] Rain down.
[690.72 → 695.24] Oh, a cloud for terror and threat.
[696.10 → 700.20] Now we need your touch again.
[700.76 → 705.76] Oh, we'll see the rain down.
[706.76 → 710.60] Rain down.
[710.60 → 712.60] Rain down.
[712.60 → 713.60] Rain down.
[713.60 → 714.60] Rain down.
[714.60 → 715.60] Rain down.
[715.60 → 716.60] Let your power fall.
[716.60 → 717.60] Let your voice be heard.
[717.60 → 721.60] Come and change our lives as we stand on your word.
[721.60 → 729.60] Holy Spirit, rain down.
[729.60 → 730.60] Rain down.
[730.60 → 731.60] Rain down.
[731.60 → 732.60] Rain down.
[732.60 → 733.60] Rain down.
[733.60 → 734.60] Oh, come for terror and threat.
[734.60 → 738.60] Now we need your touch again.
[738.60 → 739.60] Holy Spirit, rain down.
[739.60 → 740.60] Rain down.
[740.60 → 741.60] Rain down.
[741.60 → 744.60] Oh, come for terror and threat.
[744.60 → 745.60] Now we need your touch again.
[745.60 → 746.60] Now we need your touch again.
[746.60 → 752.60] Now we need your touch again.
[752.60 → 753.60] Rain down.
[753.60 → 755.60] Rain down.
[755.60 → 756.60] Rain down.
[756.60 → 757.60] Rain down.
[757.60 → 758.60] Rain down.
[758.60 → 759.60] Rain down.
[759.60 → 760.60] Rain down.
[760.60 → 761.60] Now we need your touch again.
[761.60 → 762.60] Rain down.
[762.60 → 764.60] Let your power fall.
[764.98 → 766.60] Let your voice be heard.
[766.60 → 768.60] Now we need your touch again.
[768.60 → 771.60] To change our lives as we stand on your way.
[771.60 → 773.60] Holy Spirit, rain down.
[773.60 → 780.60] Here and now
[780.60 → 787.88] No eye has seen, no ear has heard
[787.88 → 792.74] No one can know what God has shown
[792.74 → 797.88] So open up heaven, open up man
[797.88 → 804.20] Over your church and over our hearts
[804.20 → 808.76] Holy Spirit, amen
[808.76 → 813.76] Amen
[813.76 → 818.12] Oh, hope and turn
[818.12 → 824.26] Now we need to touch again
[824.26 → 829.58] Holy Spirit, rain down
[829.58 → 834.26] Rain down
[834.26 → 837.26] Let your power fall
[837.26 → 840.38] Let your voice be heard
[840.38 → 842.26] Only change our hearts
[843.04 → 845.44] As we stand on your word
[845.44 → 852.26] Holy Spirit, rain down
[852.26 → 854.26] Tonight
[859.26 → 873.50] Of Ochoa
[873.50 → 893.14] Who else demands all the roast of heaven?
[894.08 → 899.14] Who else in a heavenly count out?
[899.14 → 905.90] Who else in a whisper and darkness trembles?
[906.34 → 910.62] Only a holy God.
[912.10 → 917.26] What other beauty demands such praises?
[918.74 → 922.74] What other splendour of child and son?
[923.36 → 928.74] What other majesty rules with justice?
[929.84 → 934.14] Only a holy God.
[936.34 → 940.62] Amen be holy.
[941.18 → 945.14] The one and the only.
[946.14 → 949.14] Cry now sing holy.
[949.14 → 954.02] Forever the holy God.
[954.42 → 958.60] Come and worship the holy God.
[962.90 → 967.14] What other glory consumes thy fire?
[967.64 → 973.14] What other power and grace let air.
[973.84 → 978.74] What other faith reach as a minister?
[978.74 → 983.74] We are holy, God.
[985.74 → 993.74] Amen, behold, the one and the other.
[994.74 → 1002.74] I sing holy, forever the holy heart.
[1002.74 → 1007.74] Come and worship the holy heart.
[1008.74 → 1016.74] Amen, behold, the one and the other.
[1017.74 → 1024.74] I sing holy, forever the holy heart.
[1025.74 → 1030.74] Come and worship the holy heart.
[1032.74 → 1038.74] Come and worship the holy heart.
[1039.74 → 1042.74] Amen, behold, the one and the other.
[1042.74 → 1045.74] Come and worship the holy heart.
[1046.74 → 1050.74] Come and worship the holy heart.
[1051.74 → 1055.74] Who else could rescue me from my sins?
[1056.74 → 1061.74] Who else could offer their only son?
[1061.74 → 1066.74] Who else would like to call him Father?
[1067.74 → 1071.74] Only a holy God.
[1072.74 → 1077.74] Only my holy God.
[1077.74 → 1083.74] Come and behold, the one and the other.
[1083.74 → 1087.74] Come and worship the holy heart.
[1088.74 → 1092.74] Come and behold, the one and the other.
[1092.74 → 1094.74] Oh
[1122.74 → 1128.26] Let's join together in a time of prayer.
[1131.72 → 1133.80] Our God and Heavenly Father,
[1134.58 → 1137.00] we come to you on this Pentecost Sunday
[1137.00 → 1138.82] with thankfulness to you
[1138.82 → 1140.90] for sending your Holy Spirit
[1140.90 → 1143.18] to live in each of our hearts
[1143.18 → 1146.98] and for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
[1148.26 → 1151.98] Dear God, we confess that each of us are sinners.
[1152.74 → 1155.24] Each of us has fallen short
[1155.24 → 1157.76] and strayed from your path for us.
[1159.10 → 1161.00] We confess our pride,
[1162.44 → 1164.66] our selfishness,
[1165.42 → 1167.26] our anger,
[1167.86 → 1172.14] and our failure to love as you have loved us.
[1173.62 → 1175.98] We humbly confess our weaknesses
[1175.98 → 1179.04] and inability to live up to your standards.
[1179.04 → 1183.18] Thank you, God, for your infinite mercy
[1183.18 → 1186.10] and your gift to us of forgiveness.
[1187.96 → 1190.90] We trust in the atoning sacrifice for us
[1190.90 → 1192.96] by our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
[1194.90 → 1196.72] Your grace and forgiveness
[1196.72 → 1199.72] and the assurance that our sins are washed away,
[1199.82 → 1201.98] we receive with grateful hearts.
[1201.98 → 1204.04] we thank you
[1204.04 → 1206.92] and pray that your Holy Spirit
[1206.92 → 1209.22] would be alive in each of us,
[1209.90 → 1212.78] forever prompting us to live lives faithful to you,
[1214.12 → 1216.12] reflecting your love and truth.
[1217.06 → 1219.42] In Jesus' precious name we pray.
[1219.98 → 1220.30] Amen.
[1220.30 → 1222.24] Amen.
[1228.74 → 1235.36] Amen.
[1235.36 → 1237.20] Amen.
[1237.68 → 1238.40] Amen.
[1238.90 → 1239.18] oftentimes
[1239.18 → 1269.16] Thank you.
[1269.18 → 1299.16] Thank you.
[1299.18 → 1329.16] Thank you.
[1329.18 → 1359.16] Thank you.
[1359.18 → 1361.18] Thank you.
[1389.18 → 1391.18] Thank you.
[1419.18 → 1421.18] Thank you.
[1449.18 → 1451.18] Thank you.
[1479.18 → 1481.18] Thank you.
[1481.18 → 1486.80] To wash David's eyes
[1486.80 → 1490.28] Or do the Stephen
[1491.28 → 1495.96] To wash David's eyes
[1495.96 → 1503.24] Anybody asking the FM?
[1503.24 → 1517.56] This morning, we have opportunity to continue in our gratitude to God for his gift of faithful
[1517.56 → 1523.84] leadership to his church. This morning, we want to honour and recognize Seth Baker, Ken
[1523.84 → 1530.98] Hogue-Winning, and John Skipper, who have finished their term as pastoral elders, and Yap Wohlschlager,
[1530.98 → 1539.56] who has finished his term as deacon. In our office bearers, we see Christ's love for the church.
[1540.42 → 1547.10] He appoints leaders to build up the people and to promote the church's health. Pastoral elders offer
[1547.10 → 1556.20] spiritual and theological care, and deacons lead in mercy and justice. Office bearers must be
[1556.20 → 1562.72] Christ-like. They must be mature in faith, prayerful, patient, and humble in the Lord.
[1564.00 → 1572.54] Today, by the Spirit's power on Pentecost, we ordain and install PIM School as a pastoral elder.
[1573.42 → 1579.32] Jesus Hernandez and Frank Welding will be ordained and installed as pastoral elders at a future date.
[1579.32 → 1585.78] And today, we also ordain and install Pete Birken pass and Warren Version as deacons.
[1586.64 → 1592.80] To affirm your calling to this office, I'm going to invite you to come to the front at this point.
[1593.86 → 1601.80] And so, PIM and Pete and Warren, come on up to the front. Centre stage, gentlemen.
[1601.80 → 1617.96] I'm going to ask you four questions. I'll read all four questions, and then I'll go through,
[1618.38 → 1624.52] ask you by name what your response is. I invite you to respond by saying, I do, with God's help.
[1624.52 → 1634.18] And so, do you believe that in the call of this congregation, God himself is calling you to these
[1634.18 → 1641.22] holy offices? Do you believe that the Old and New Testaments are the word of God, the only infallible
[1641.22 → 1647.60] rule for life and faith? Do you subscribe to the doctrinal standards of this church, rejecting all
[1647.60 → 1653.40] teaching which contradicts them? And do you promise to do the work of your offices faithfully in a way
[1653.40 → 1658.32] worthy of your calling and in submission to the governance and discipline of the church?
[1659.14 → 1666.14] Pete, what is your answer? I do, with God's help. Amen. Warren, what is your answer? I do, with God's help. Amen.
[1666.48 → 1673.56] PIM, what is your answer? I do, with God's help. Amen. I'm going to invite you guys to come down to the front here.
[1673.96 → 1680.80] We're going to take a moment. It is biblical practice in the ordination and installation of leaders in the church
[1680.80 → 1687.92] to mark the moving of the Spirit in the laying on of hands. And so, if you are a council member or a family member
[1687.92 → 1695.76] or someone, we invite you also to the front now as we lay hands on these men as they begin their terms of service
[1695.76 → 1705.10] among us here. Additionally, if you would like, you may hold your hand out as a sign that we, together as the church,
[1705.10 → 1710.88] through whom the Spirit works, call these to service.
[1722.22 → 1723.44] Together, then, we pray.
[1725.94 → 1732.04] God, our Father, who has called you to these sacred offices, guide you by his word.
[1732.04 → 1737.70] May he equip you with his Spirit and bless your ministry among us.
[1738.74 → 1745.52] May he make you faithful workers in his vineyard, and may his church grow in grace and faith and service
[1745.52 → 1754.66] under your care. And may you serve with joy and humility, rooted in the daily awe of our good God.
[1754.66 → 1760.18] God, help us, Lord, as your church, to gladly accept their leadership,
[1760.76 → 1765.86] to remember them and encourage them, and to honour them for the sake of Christ,
[1766.34 → 1769.18] and to pray for them in the work that you have called them to do.
[1769.94 → 1773.38] It's in the name of Jesus Christ we pray. Amen.
[1774.34 → 1774.70] Amen.
[1774.70 → 1774.82] Amen.
[1784.66 → 1792.20] I want to take a moment and remind us all the charge to these individuals.
[1792.40 → 1798.20] And so this isn't just for the new office bearers, but it's a reminder for the continuing office bearers,
[1798.28 → 1804.82] and for us all, to know what it is that we call them to, and the standard that God has laid out for them.
[1804.82 → 1815.30] And so Pym and the rest of the pastoral elders, encourage by sound doctrine and hold firmly to the trustworthy message.
[1816.38 → 1817.56] Pray continually.
[1818.70 → 1820.72] Welcome children as you would welcome Christ.
[1821.46 → 1822.86] Guide the young with joy.
[1823.44 → 1827.20] Know the scriptures and be mastered by your Lord.
[1828.46 → 1834.52] And to Pete and Warren and to all the deacons, hold firmly to the trustworthy message.
[1835.70 → 1838.18] Be worthy of respect and sincere.
[1839.34 → 1841.88] Serve with the spirit and in wisdom.
[1842.80 → 1849.72] Model justice, mercy, and humility as you teach us to walk humbly with our God.
[1851.72 → 1858.18] People of God, receive these office bearers as Christ's gift to the church.
[1858.94 → 1861.18] Honour them and take their counsel seriously.
[1861.70 → 1863.82] Obey and support them and pray for them.
[1864.60 → 1867.00] Stand with them in their service.
[1867.56 → 1870.30] To that end, I'm going to invite you as you are able to stand,
[1870.80 → 1873.24] and I will ask you all a question as well,
[1873.24 → 1875.62] and invite you to respond as you see behind me.
[1875.76 → 1877.30] We do with God's help.
[1879.80 → 1883.56] And so do you, Congregation of God, Church Family of Langley, Emmanuel,
[1884.12 → 1888.48] pledge to receive these office bearers as they have been charged?
[1888.48 → 1891.44] We do with God's help.
[1892.16 → 1892.64] Amen.
[1893.06 → 1893.68] Have a seat.
[1893.86 → 1895.54] I'm going to invite the deacons forward at this time.
[1896.06 → 1897.70] We continue our worship in offering.
[1897.70 → 1910.48] Good morning.
[1910.48 → 1910.54] Good morning.
[1911.08 → 1911.92] My name is Brenda.

[1913.88 → 1916.42] We continue the giving of our gifts.
[1916.92 → 1920.08] We continue our worship with the giving of our gifts this morning.
[1920.08 → 1923.82] Before that, I just want to highlight again,
[1924.00 → 1925.62] as we have heard these last few weeks,
[1925.76 → 1928.04] that Advocate Life and Education Services
[1928.04 → 1930.84] and the Baby Bottle Campaign.
[1932.30 → 1936.14] Advocate Life and Education Services brings hope in action
[1936.14 → 1939.48] to women and families through pregnancy counselling and resources,
[1939.76 → 1943.48] baby supplies, postpartum support, post-abortion care,
[1944.00 → 1946.26] community education, and so much more.
[1946.76 → 1949.96] Thank you to everyone who has already picked up a bottle
[1949.96 → 1951.20] for the Baby Bottle Campaign.
[1951.48 → 1953.58] If you haven't yet, it's not too late.
[1953.82 → 1956.36] They are in the back on the...
[1956.36 → 1957.70] I think they're back there.
[1957.90 → 1960.46] They will be back there on the back counter.
[1961.32 → 1965.38] And next Sunday is the final week for this campaign,
[1965.38 → 1967.22] so you can pick up your baby bottle today
[1967.22 → 1969.96] or go online to babybottles.ca.
[1970.74 → 1976.12] Our offerings for today is for the ministry and mission of our church.
[1976.74 → 1980.86] And the second one is for the well.
[1981.72 → 1986.30] The well is a church plant that was originally established in Kelowna, B.C.,
[1986.30 → 1988.52] and it has recently closed its doors.
[1989.34 → 1994.06] As a result, Classes has contacted us as churches
[1994.06 → 1998.52] and has requested that congregations consider taking up a special offering
[1998.52 → 2001.94] to support Pastor Jen during this transition time.
[2002.44 → 2006.04] This offering will go toward providing her with a severance package,
[2006.52 → 2008.66] recognizing her dedication, leadership,
[2008.86 → 2011.88] and the many ways that she has poured into the life of the church
[2011.88 → 2013.32] and the broader community.
[2014.10 → 2016.30] Please give as God has blessed.
[2016.30 → 2046.28] Thank you.
[2046.30 → 2047.62] Thank you.

[2324.06 → 2331.34] saying and also with you and so hands up together we say the Lord be with you amen
[2348.76 → 2353.44] good morning

[2364.70 → 2371.58] the sanctuary right now how blessed we are to have them let's turn to our I'm Peter, and I'm
[2371.58 → 2378.94] giving the congregational prayer this morning shall we pray father God we thank you for this day
[2378.94 → 2387.50] we're reminded that today we in the liturgical calendar of the Christian church we celebrate
[2387.50 → 2395.30] Pentecost Lord we think of how important that has been for the transmission of your message
[2395.30 → 2406.62] we think of when Jesus said goodbye to his disciples on ascension day when he was lifted, and he promised
[2406.62 → 2412.56] them and as Luke records Jesus said you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you
[2412.56 → 2420.30] and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem Judea Samaria and to the ends of the earth
[2420.30 → 2430.18] Lord this is amazing 2,000 years later we can honestly say that your spirit has been alive through the story
[2430.18 → 2437.54] that's gone on for 2,000 years we see it here this morning we see the communion table
[2437.54 → 2445.14] Lord we see the appointment of elders, and we know that all around the world your church is there
[2445.14 → 2454.62] and we are amazed we think of the four young adults among us from our church Josh Jared
[2454.62 → 2462.58] Melty and Sarah who are in the Philippines at the moment the Philippines Jerusalem to Samaria
[2462.58 → 2473.28] to the Philippines every part of the world Aidan doing Bible translation that's in currently in Africa
[2473.28 → 2482.44] how amazing is that the whole that the Bible has been translated in thou over a thousand different languages
[2482.44 → 2489.52] people called to do that who feel through the Holy Spirit that's going to be their witness
[2489.52 → 2495.34] we think Lord of our Mexico missions we've had 30 years of it in this church
[2495.34 → 2500.36] we think of Jody and her husband Earl and their work committed to missions
[2500.36 → 2513.52] we thank you for them, we think of Joanne Miles her mom passed away this week the Jennie family has been an incredible example even in denominational work
[2513.52 → 2528.52] but she proclaimed her name to the end we thank you for her life we think Lord of just the baptisms that we've had in our church just a few weeks ago the Lingering family marked D and their children
[2528.52 → 2531.36] and look at here this morning
[2531.36 → 2535.80] and look at here this morning Andy and Enrich Demons 50 years married
[2535.80 → 2540.36] the children beside the grandchildren 50 years
[2540.36 → 2544.82] 25 years marriage one of their children
[2544.82 → 2547.54] and a new wedding
[2547.54 → 2551.82] Lord your Holy Spirit shows up in our marriages
[2551.82 → 2554.42] shows up in so many different places
[2554.42 → 2557.26] we thank you, Lord, for this example
[2557.26 → 2563.58] thank you also Lord that many of our students are graduating from Langley Christian School
[2563.58 → 2566.26] and we thank you for Langley Christian's testimony
[2566.26 → 2571.12] your Holy Spirit too has nurtured that for over 70 years this year
[2571.12 → 2573.12] who would have known
[2573.12 → 2575.12] but
[2575.12 → 2578.12] so much yet to pray for
[2578.12 → 2581.26] as sin and the deceiver plays its role
[2581.26 → 2584.10] the effect of cancer
[2584.10 → 2587.42] Doug and Tessa and Tanya and hospice
[2587.42 → 2588.88] Lord
[2588.88 → 2592.84] we just ask you to be there for Tanya
[2592.84 → 2596.84] may she has confidence in your goodness
[2596.84 → 2599.78] we thank you for her
[2599.78 → 2602.68] and her family that stands by her side
[2602.68 → 2605.46] reveal to her the promise
[2605.46 → 2607.44] Lord we
[2607.44 → 2610.96] thank also of those who are here this morning with a loss
[2610.96 → 2612.88] we think of the Skipper family again
[2612.88 → 2616.34] we think of their son Matt and grandchildren
[2616.34 → 2619.36] who are struggling with the loss of Rachel
[2619.36 → 2622.96] Rachel who played a big role in our church in the early years here
[2622.96 → 2624.92] too young to die
[2624.92 → 2625.72] we would say
[2625.72 → 2626.22] Lord
[2626.22 → 2628.20] we don't understand
[2628.20 → 2630.20] but we give her over to you
[2630.20 → 2632.70] we also
[2632.70 → 2635.34] as we stand here, and we reflect
[2635.34 → 2638.16] like with Andy and Enrich as well
[2638.16 → 2639.82] all of us have families
[2639.82 → 2641.20] extended families
[2641.20 → 2644.72] and we also recognize there's unbelief there
[2644.72 → 2645.80] or
[2645.80 → 2648.40] they're on the margins
[2648.40 → 2650.36] trying to figure out
[2650.36 → 2651.38] do I go to church
[2651.38 → 2652.16] do I not
[2652.16 → 2653.54] do I believe
[2653.54 → 2655.32] what's in it for me
[2655.32 → 2657.26] or what's not in it for me
[2657.26 → 2659.54] Lord we lean into
[2659.54 → 2660.92] your promises
[2660.92 → 2662.42] also baptism
[2662.42 → 2664.54] and yet
[2664.54 → 2665.28] Lord
[2665.28 → 2667.94] in spite of the outpouring of your Holy Spirit
[2667.94 → 2669.10] the world is still
[2669.10 → 2670.58] in disarray
[2670.58 → 2673.42] there's that Gaza-Israeli war
[2673.42 → 2674.92] your message
[2674.92 → 2676.00] you said right there
[2676.00 → 2678.16] the message will go to Jerusalem
[2678.16 → 2681.14] and look at the fighting that continues there
[2681.14 → 2682.48] look in Ukraine and Russia
[2682.48 → 2684.42] what's going on
[2684.42 → 2686.14] there's lack of leadership
[2686.14 → 2687.92] so we know Lord
[2687.92 → 2688.76] that you're coming
[2688.76 → 2689.70] is imminent
[2689.70 → 2691.62] and we trust in that
[2691.62 → 2692.56] and hope in that
[2692.56 → 2694.54] but things could be so not
[2694.54 → 2695.36] so different
[2695.36 → 2697.70] we're not dismayed
[2697.70 → 2699.82] we lean into your promises
[2699.82 → 2701.76] you are sovereign
[2701.76 → 2703.92] Jesus is Lord and King
[2703.92 → 2705.50] over all
[2705.50 → 2707.70] may his name be praised
[2707.70 → 2708.22] Amen
[2708.22 → 2732.82] sometimes when I'm up here
[2732.82 → 2733.46] preaching
[2733.46 → 2735.68] I get to a particular point
[2735.68 → 2737.00] and I take my glasses off
[2737.00 → 2737.60] and I hold them
[2737.60 → 2738.74] and that's how you know
[2738.74 → 2739.42] that it matters
[2739.42 → 2741.78] I'm taking my glasses off now
[2741.78 → 2742.84] because it's too hot
[2742.84 → 2743.76] and my face is sweaty
[2743.76 → 2744.70] and they're falling off
[2744.70 → 2746.80] but this whole thing matters
[2746.80 → 2748.50] so don't miss the cue
[2748.50 → 2750.94] this morning
[2750.94 → 2753.82] we're going to reflect on Pentecost
[2753.82 → 2755.86] and the way the Spirit
[2755.86 → 2757.96] provides us assurance
[2757.96 → 2759.40] in our faith
[2759.40 → 2760.58] and we're going to do that
[2760.58 → 2762.78] as we have in this season
[2762.78 → 2765.62] through the Gospel according to Luke
[2765.62 → 2768.28] and a bit of Luke's second book
[2768.28 → 2769.22] the book of Acts
[2769.22 → 2770.66] so I'm going to read
[2770.66 → 2771.98] from Luke 1
[2771.98 → 2773.66] we'll read the first four verses
[2773.66 → 2775.00] and then I'm going to read
[2775.00 → 2776.82] a few verses from Luke 2
[2776.82 → 2779.44] beginning at verse 16 there
[2779.44 → 2780.84] and so I encourage you
[2780.84 → 2781.98] if you have a Bible with you
[2781.98 → 2782.74] open it up
[2782.74 → 2784.16] follow along
[2784.16 → 2784.86] read along
[2784.86 → 2785.92] and then keep it open
[2785.92 → 2786.54] in front of you
[2786.54 → 2787.68] if you need a Bible
[2787.68 → 2788.82] there's some at the back
[2788.82 → 2790.96] you are welcome to grab
[2790.96 → 2791.56] some of those
[2791.56 → 2792.58] from the back
[2792.58 → 2794.92] and if you
[2794.92 → 2795.92] have a device
[2795.92 → 2796.62] and you want to read
[2796.62 → 2797.12] your Bible there
[2797.12 → 2798.20] I encourage you to do that
[2798.20 → 2798.62] as well
[2798.62 → 2799.54] but always
[2799.54 → 2800.42] just to keep it open
[2800.42 → 2801.62] as we go through
[2801.62 → 2802.54] our text this morning
[2802.54 → 2804.34] let's start
[2804.34 → 2806.24] in Luke 1
[2806.24 → 2810.38] many have taken
[2810.38 → 2811.24] to draw up
[2811.24 → 2811.80] an account
[2811.80 → 2812.68] of the things
[2812.68 → 2813.76] that have been fulfilled
[2813.76 → 2814.50] among us
[2814.50 → 2816.84] just as they were handed down
[2816.84 → 2817.52] to us
[2817.52 → 2818.24] by those
[2818.24 → 2818.72] from
[2818.72 → 2819.36] who
[2819.36 → 2820.34] from the first
[2820.34 → 2821.54] were eyewitnesses
[2821.54 → 2822.18] and servants
[2822.18 → 2823.06] of the word
[2823.06 → 2825.20] with this in mind
[2825.20 → 2826.80] since I myself
[2826.80 → 2828.28] have carefully investigated
[2828.28 → 2829.76] everything from the beginning
[2829.76 → 2830.94] I too
[2830.94 → 2832.18] decided to write
[2832.18 → 2833.34] an orderly account
[2833.34 → 2833.96] for you
[2833.96 → 2835.26] most excellent
[2835.26 → 2836.12] Theophilus
[2836.12 → 2837.88] so that you may know
[2837.88 → 2838.70] the certainty
[2838.70 → 2839.80] of the things
[2839.80 → 2841.50] you have been taught
[2841.50 → 2843.46] and then let's
[2843.46 → 2845.26] flip over to
[2845.26 → 2847.30] Acts 2
[2847.30 → 2848.62] beginning at
[2848.62 → 2850.30] verse 16
[2850.30 → 2852.60] I think on the screen
[2852.60 → 2853.16] behind me
[2853.16 → 2853.84] will be through
[2853.84 → 2854.62] verse 18
[2854.62 → 2855.18] but I'm actually
[2855.18 → 2855.88] going to read through
[2855.88 → 2856.72] verse 21
[2856.72 → 2860.16] so this is Peter
[2860.16 → 2861.26] addressing the crowd
[2861.26 → 2861.80] his
[2861.80 → 2863.90] post-Holy Spirit
[2863.90 → 2865.02] descending on them
[2865.02 → 2866.32] in tongues of fire
[2866.32 → 2867.16] sermon
[2867.16 → 2868.16] to those gathered
[2868.16 → 2868.78] in Jerusalem
[2868.78 → 2870.08] he says
[2870.08 → 2871.72] this is what was spoken
[2871.72 → 2873.02] by the prophet Joel
[2873.02 → 2875.10] in the last days
[2875.10 → 2875.96] God says
[2875.96 → 2877.10] I will pour out
[2877.10 → 2877.84] my spirit
[2877.84 → 2878.78] on all people
[2878.78 → 2880.56] your sons and daughters
[2880.56 → 2881.36] will prophesy
[2881.36 → 2882.28] your young men
[2882.28 → 2883.12] will see visions
[2883.12 → 2884.16] your old men
[2884.16 → 2885.14] will dream dreams
[2885.14 → 2886.96] even on my servants
[2886.96 → 2887.94] both men and women
[2887.94 → 2889.02] I will pour out
[2889.02 → 2889.70] my spirit
[2889.70 → 2890.60] in those days
[2890.60 → 2891.90] and they will prophesy
[2891.90 → 2893.90] I will show wonders
[2893.90 → 2894.96] in the heavens above
[2894.96 → 2896.12] and signs on the earth
[2896.12 → 2896.56] below
[2896.56 → 2897.80] blood and fire
[2897.80 → 2899.02] and billows of smoke
[2899.02 → 2900.74] the sun will be turned
[2900.74 → 2901.32] to darkness
[2901.32 → 2902.38] and the moon to blood
[2902.38 → 2903.44] before the coming
[2903.44 → 2904.68] of the great and glorious
[2904.68 → 2906.08] day of the Lord
[2906.08 → 2907.28] and everyone
[2907.28 → 2909.04] who calls on the name
[2909.04 → 2909.80] of the Lord
[2909.80 → 2911.16] will be saved
[2911.16 → 2913.12] this is the word
[2913.12 → 2913.58] of the Lord
[2913.58 → 2922.12] we live in an age
[2922.12 → 2924.06] at a particular time
[2924.06 → 2926.22] that craves certainty
[2926.22 → 2927.98] and yet
[2927.98 → 2928.68] somehow
[2928.68 → 2929.76] seems allergic
[2929.76 → 2930.94] to the idea
[2930.94 → 2931.60] of certainty
[2931.60 → 2934.60] every day
[2934.60 → 2936.00] we are flooded
[2936.00 → 2937.12] with information
[2937.12 → 2938.12] headlines
[2938.12 → 2939.08] and opinions
[2939.08 → 2940.06] and arguments
[2940.06 → 2941.28] new studies
[2941.28 → 2941.92] coming out
[2941.92 → 2942.66] new posts
[2942.66 → 2943.98] and then the counter posts
[2943.98 → 2945.36] that contradict them
[2945.36 → 2946.10] and yet
[2946.10 → 2947.74] the more we know
[2947.74 → 2949.56] the less sure
[2949.56 → 2950.22] we feel
[2950.22 → 2952.46] the voices
[2952.46 → 2953.18] are loud
[2953.18 → 2954.40] the facts
[2954.40 → 2955.52] are contested
[2955.52 → 2956.50] and the truth
[2956.50 → 2958.24] feels slippery
[2958.24 → 2961.12] and so
[2961.12 → 2963.04] we hesitate
[2963.04 → 2965.96] we overthink
[2965.96 → 2968.10] we analyze
[2968.10 → 2969.38] and second guess
[2969.38 → 2970.88] we want to believe
[2970.88 → 2971.66] in something
[2971.66 → 2972.70] but we also
[2972.70 → 2973.06] don't want
[2973.06 → 2973.62] to be fooled
[2973.62 → 2975.22] we want
[2975.22 → 2975.68] to commit
[2975.68 → 2977.20] but we're afraid
[2977.20 → 2978.32] what it might cost us
[2978.32 → 2981.16] now add to that
[2981.16 → 2982.50] a particular
[2982.50 → 2983.58] cultural climate
[2983.58 → 2984.00] where
[2984.00 → 2985.14] where cynicism
[2985.14 → 2986.04] gets clicks
[2986.04 → 2987.90] truth
[2987.90 → 2988.64] is rare
[2988.64 → 2990.40] and sincerity
[2990.40 → 2992.12] can feel
[2992.12 → 2992.70] naive
[2992.70 → 2995.82] and add to that
[2995.82 → 2998.20] we've been
[2998.20 → 2998.74] disappointed
[2998.74 → 3000.58] by our institutions
[3000.58 → 3002.54] we've been
[3002.54 → 3003.08] misled
[3003.08 → 3004.34] by leaders
[3004.34 → 3005.80] we've been
[3005.80 → 3006.20] hurt
[3006.20 → 3007.14] by people
[3007.14 → 3007.66] we trusted
[3007.66 → 3008.74] we've been
[3008.74 → 3009.22] burned
[3009.22 → 3010.10] by promises
[3010.10 → 3011.68] and so
[3011.68 → 3012.12] we keep
[3012.12 → 3012.78] our guard up
[3012.78 → 3014.20] we keep
[3014.20 → 3014.74] our faith
[3014.74 → 3015.72] tentative
[3015.72 → 3016.86] and our
[3016.86 → 3017.22] commitment
[3017.22 → 3017.72] small
[3017.72 → 3019.90] we have this
[3019.90 → 3020.30] ache
[3020.30 → 3021.66] for certainty
[3021.66 → 3023.06] in an age
[3023.06 → 3023.96] of information
[3023.96 → 3024.58] overload
[3024.58 → 3026.28] and some
[3026.28 → 3026.82] of us
[3026.82 → 3027.82] without meaning
[3027.82 → 3028.26] to
[3028.26 → 3028.94] perhaps
[3028.94 → 3030.04] have ended
[3030.04 → 3031.02] up in a kind
[3031.02 → 3031.74] of spiritual
[3031.74 → 3032.50] paralysis
[3032.50 → 3034.48] stuck in our
[3034.48 → 3034.86] heads
[3034.86 → 3036.62] and unable
[3036.62 → 3037.46] to step out
[3037.46 → 3039.62] we want
[3039.62 → 3040.50] something solid
[3040.50 → 3041.76] something real
[3041.76 → 3042.30] something that we
[3042.30 → 3042.90] can build our
[3042.90 → 3043.56] lives on
[3043.56 → 3044.46] but the question
[3044.46 → 3045.22] keeps coming back
[3045.22 → 3046.28] how do I know
[3046.28 → 3046.96] this is true
[3046.96 → 3049.08] and if it is
[3049.08 → 3050.70] can I trust it
[3050.70 → 3053.50] how can I trust
[3053.50 → 3054.52] anything
[3054.52 → 3055.72] enough to build
[3055.72 → 3056.74] my life on it
[3056.74 → 3058.30] especially when
[3058.30 → 3059.42] everything feels
[3059.42 → 3060.00] uncertain
[3060.00 → 3061.10] and unstable
[3061.10 → 3062.18] and up for debate
[3062.18 → 3065.14] that's exactly
[3065.14 → 3065.88] the question
[3065.88 → 3066.96] that Luke
[3066.96 → 3068.28] wants to answer
[3068.28 → 3070.18] and then
[3070.18 → 3071.14] that's exactly
[3071.14 → 3072.26] the kind
[3072.26 → 3073.34] of transformation
[3073.34 → 3075.02] that Pentecost
[3075.02 → 3076.60] makes possible
[3076.60 → 3078.96] let's dig in
[3078.96 → 3080.60] in verse 3
[3080.60 → 3081.64] from Luke 1
[3081.64 → 3082.70] we read
[3082.70 → 3083.92] that
[3083.92 → 3085.18] I too
[3085.18 → 3085.86] Luke
[3085.86 → 3086.54] decided
[3086.54 → 3087.34] to write
[3087.34 → 3088.16] an orderly
[3088.16 → 3088.66] account
[3088.66 → 3089.42] for you
[3089.42 → 3090.88] so that
[3090.88 → 3091.42] you may
[3091.42 → 3091.94] know
[3091.94 → 3092.96] the certainty
[3092.96 → 3094.16] of the things
[3094.16 → 3094.88] you have
[3094.88 → 3095.86] been taught
[3095.86 → 3097.72] Luke says
[3097.72 → 3098.22] right at the
[3098.22 → 3098.54] beginning
[3098.54 → 3099.40] of his record
[3099.40 → 3100.16] that he's
[3100.16 → 3100.92] writing this
[3100.92 → 3101.38] story
[3101.38 → 3102.42] for a specific
[3102.42 → 3103.28] purpose
[3103.28 → 3104.22] of passing
[3104.22 → 3105.24] on the truth
[3105.24 → 3106.32] of the things
[3106.32 → 3107.30] that Theodosius
[3107.30 → 3108.20] has been
[3108.20 → 3108.62] taught
[3108.62 → 3109.66] he tells us
[3109.66 → 3110.22] right from the
[3110.22 → 3110.52] off
[3110.52 → 3110.94] that he's
[3110.94 → 3111.58] writing as
[3111.58 → 3112.32] an investigator
[3112.32 → 3113.34] he writes
[3113.34 → 3114.58] as a scholar
[3114.58 → 3115.64] he's doing
[3115.64 → 3116.30] research
[3116.30 → 3117.30] and he says
[3117.30 → 3118.08] many have
[3118.08 → 3118.60] undertaken
[3118.60 → 3119.34] to draw up
[3119.34 → 3119.84] an account
[3119.84 → 3121.66] lots of people
[3121.66 → 3122.36] have done this
[3122.36 → 3122.80] he says
[3122.80 → 3123.38] and I've
[3123.38 → 3123.62] checked
[3123.62 → 3124.96] I've read
[3124.96 → 3125.28] them
[3125.28 → 3126.34] I've done
[3126.34 → 3127.36] the literature
[3127.36 → 3127.92] review
[3127.92 → 3130.24] as part of
[3130.24 → 3131.34] my doctoral
[3131.34 → 3131.94] studies
[3131.94 → 3132.92] right now
[3132.92 → 3133.68] and for my
[3133.68 → 3134.10] dissertation
[3134.10 → 3135.86] I have had
[3135.86 → 3136.70] to submit
[3136.70 → 3137.48] what's called
[3137.48 → 3138.06] a literature
[3138.06 → 3138.76] review
[3138.76 → 3139.90] and the point
[3139.90 → 3141.26] is to show
[3141.26 → 3142.06] that I am
[3142.06 → 3142.92] familiar with
[3142.92 → 3143.50] the scholarly
[3143.50 → 3144.26] work and the
[3144.26 → 3145.22] academic discussion
[3145.22 → 3146.04] on the particular
[3146.04 → 3147.04] field that I'm
[3147.04 → 3148.12] focusing in on
[3148.12 → 3148.76] it's to show
[3148.76 → 3149.68] that I am
[3149.68 → 3150.32] an informed
[3150.32 → 3151.60] voice on the
[3151.60 → 3151.96] subject
[3151.96 → 3152.58] that I have
[3152.58 → 3153.54] read the
[3153.54 → 3154.30] vast amount
[3154.30 → 3154.72] of literature
[3154.72 → 3155.40] on this
[3155.40 → 3156.22] particular
[3156.22 → 3157.00] topic
[3157.00 → 3157.70] and that I
[3157.70 → 3158.48] hope to add
[3158.48 → 3159.36] to this field
[3159.36 → 3159.98] with my
[3159.98 → 3160.62] work
[3160.62 → 3162.24] that's exactly
[3162.24 → 3162.82] what Luke is
[3162.82 → 3163.40] doing here
[3163.40 → 3164.72] right he is
[3164.72 → 3165.40] demonstrating
[3165.40 → 3166.12] that he is
[3166.12 → 3166.70] a worthwhile
[3166.70 → 3167.34] source
[3167.34 → 3167.92] and that his
[3167.92 → 3168.78] voice is
[3168.78 → 3169.64] worthy to be
[3169.64 → 3170.82] added to the
[3170.82 → 3172.28] collection of
[3172.28 → 3173.50] voices being
[3173.50 → 3173.94] spoken
[3173.94 → 3175.24] and so he
[3175.24 → 3175.98] says with
[3175.98 → 3177.06] this in mind
[3177.06 → 3177.50] I have
[3177.50 → 3178.00] carefully
[3178.00 → 3178.86] investigated
[3178.86 → 3179.56] everything
[3179.56 → 3180.50] from the
[3180.50 → 3180.80] beginning
[3180.80 → 3181.72] right again
[3181.72 → 3182.62] he's underscoring
[3182.62 → 3183.12] this fact
[3183.12 → 3183.98] I have done
[3183.98 → 3184.44] the work
[3184.44 → 3185.46] I have listened
[3185.46 → 3186.26] to the sources
[3186.26 → 3187.24] I've done the
[3187.24 → 3187.92] literature review
[3187.92 → 3188.98] I have investigated
[3188.98 → 3189.86] and I have done
[3189.86 → 3190.56] the detective
[3190.56 → 3192.26] process here
[3192.26 → 3193.72] and then he
[3193.72 → 3194.50] also tells us
[3194.50 → 3194.98] that he's done
[3194.98 → 3196.58] original research
[3196.58 → 3197.40] right listen
[3197.40 → 3197.94] to what he
[3197.94 → 3198.30] says he
[3198.30 → 3198.54] says
[3198.54 → 3202.12] I have read
[3202.12 → 3202.48] and listened
[3202.48 → 3203.60] to the things
[3203.60 → 3204.28] that were fulfilled
[3204.28 → 3204.74] among us
[3204.74 → 3205.50] and spoken to us
[3205.50 → 3206.42] from those
[3206.42 → 3207.82] who were first
[3207.82 → 3209.00] eyewitnesses
[3209.00 → 3209.82] and servants
[3209.82 → 3211.12] of the word
[3211.12 → 3212.68] no
[3212.68 → 3214.74] we know
[3214.74 → 3215.72] that Luke
[3215.72 → 3216.54] travelled
[3216.54 → 3217.82] with the
[3217.82 → 3218.58] apostle Paul
[3218.58 → 3219.80] we know
[3219.80 → 3221.46] that Mark
[3221.46 → 3222.68] also travelled
[3222.68 → 3224.12] with the
[3224.12 → 3224.88] apostle Paul
[3224.88 → 3225.52] we know
[3225.52 → 3226.04] that Luke
[3226.04 → 3226.78] and Mark
[3226.78 → 3227.24] travelled
[3227.24 → 3227.70] together
[3227.70 → 3228.52] with Paul
[3228.52 → 3230.54] at least
[3230.54 → 3230.98] on two
[3230.98 → 3231.42] occasions
[3231.42 → 3232.18] we can read
[3232.18 → 3232.60] about that
[3232.60 → 3232.80] in the
[3232.80 → 3233.24] New Testament
[3233.24 → 3235.30] and it's
[3235.30 → 3236.02] also very
[3236.02 → 3236.40] likely
[3236.40 → 3237.46] that Luke
[3237.46 → 3238.58] met Peter
[3238.58 → 3240.00] at the very
[3240.00 → 3240.68] least he
[3240.68 → 3241.28] met Peter
[3241.28 → 3242.20] when Paul
[3242.20 → 3242.80] and Peter
[3242.80 → 3243.34] were both
[3243.34 → 3243.90] in Rome
[3243.90 → 3244.46] and we know
[3244.46 → 3244.86] that Luke
[3244.86 → 3245.40] was there
[3245.40 → 3246.32] with Paul
[3246.32 → 3247.90] for the
[3247.90 → 3248.56] martyrdom
[3248.56 → 3249.42] and imprisonment
[3249.42 → 3249.92] of both
[3249.92 → 3251.50] it's likely
[3251.50 → 3252.20] that because
[3252.20 → 3253.12] of Paul
[3253.12 → 3253.56] Luke
[3253.56 → 3254.22] had access
[3254.22 → 3255.18] to James
[3255.18 → 3255.82] and to the
[3255.82 → 3256.56] other leaders
[3256.56 → 3257.14] of the early
[3257.14 → 3258.16] church in Jerusalem
[3258.16 → 3260.44] and many scholars
[3260.44 → 3261.68] actually suppose
[3261.68 → 3262.36] that Luke
[3262.36 → 3263.04] had access
[3263.04 → 3263.94] to the family
[3263.94 → 3264.50] of Jesus
[3264.50 → 3265.16] or at the very
[3265.16 → 3266.06] least to Mary
[3266.06 → 3267.24] because of all
[3267.24 → 3268.32] the details
[3268.32 → 3269.50] that he includes
[3269.50 → 3270.44] from Mary's
[3270.44 → 3270.94] perspective
[3270.94 → 3272.06] in his gospel
[3272.06 → 3274.16] point is
[3274.16 → 3274.58] again
[3274.58 → 3275.40] Luke has
[3275.40 → 3275.94] connected
[3275.94 → 3276.76] with the people
[3276.76 → 3277.44] who saw it
[3277.44 → 3278.04] first hand
[3278.04 → 3279.74] he's drawn
[3279.74 → 3280.42] in all
[3280.42 → 3280.86] of these
[3280.86 → 3281.68] sources
[3281.68 → 3282.64] point is
[3282.64 → 3283.28] the gospel
[3283.28 → 3283.68] that he's
[3283.68 → 3284.00] writing
[3284.00 → 3285.08] isn't guesswork
[3285.08 → 3285.96] it's grounded
[3285.96 → 3287.22] right
[3287.22 → 3287.82] it's not a
[3287.82 → 3288.66] made up story
[3288.66 → 3289.12] it's a
[3289.12 → 3289.86] magisterial
[3289.86 → 3290.36] history
[3290.36 → 3292.12] and because
[3292.12 → 3292.76] Luke has
[3292.76 → 3293.44] investigated
[3293.44 → 3294.08] carefully
[3294.08 → 3294.98] he's saying
[3294.98 → 3295.86] to Theophilus
[3295.86 → 3296.62] you can
[3296.62 → 3297.20] believe
[3297.20 → 3298.16] confidently
[3298.16 → 3300.10] and that's
[3300.10 → 3300.66] his point
[3300.66 → 3301.78] so that you
[3301.78 → 3302.28] may know
[3302.28 → 3303.12] the certainty
[3303.12 → 3304.14] of the things
[3304.14 → 3304.56] you have
[3304.56 → 3305.18] been taught
[3305.18 → 3307.52] now
[3307.52 → 3309.82] I want to
[3309.82 → 3310.34] take a moment
[3310.34 → 3311.78] and stop
[3311.78 → 3312.34] here
[3312.34 → 3314.36] because it's
[3314.36 → 3315.20] plausible
[3315.20 → 3316.34] likely even
[3316.34 → 3317.52] that you hear
[3317.52 → 3318.44] me say that
[3318.44 → 3319.00] and you go
[3319.00 → 3320.06] okay sure
[3320.06 → 3320.96] that's what Luke
[3320.96 → 3321.68] did but how
[3321.68 → 3322.72] do I know
[3322.72 → 3324.94] how do I know
[3324.94 → 3326.16] that this isn't
[3326.16 → 3326.96] just Luke's
[3326.96 → 3328.04] version of events
[3328.04 → 3328.70] or this isn't
[3328.70 → 3329.30] just wishful
[3329.30 → 3330.02] thinking dressed
[3330.02 → 3331.02] up as history
[3331.02 → 3331.98] how do I know
[3331.98 → 3332.76] that Luke
[3332.76 → 3333.50] even with good
[3333.50 → 3333.96] intentions
[3333.96 → 3334.66] didn't just
[3334.66 → 3335.50] skew things
[3335.50 → 3336.22] away from the
[3336.22 → 3336.88] actual truth
[3336.88 → 3337.34] in order to
[3337.34 → 3337.60] make his
[3337.60 → 3337.90] point
[3337.90 → 3339.80] and that's
[3339.80 → 3340.04] a fair
[3340.04 → 3340.52] question
[3340.52 → 3341.62] it's actually
[3341.62 → 3342.08] a perfect
[3342.08 → 3342.62] question
[3342.62 → 3344.68] and it's
[3344.68 → 3345.04] actually
[3345.04 → 3345.82] indicative
[3345.82 → 3346.42] of an even
[3346.42 → 3347.34] bigger question
[3347.34 → 3348.60] right
[3348.60 → 3349.44] how do we
[3349.44 → 3350.16] know anything
[3350.16 → 3352.26] but especially
[3352.26 → 3353.36] history
[3353.36 → 3354.58] right
[3354.58 → 3355.16] how can we
[3355.16 → 3355.78] ascertain
[3355.78 → 3356.32] the truth
[3356.32 → 3357.06] of anything
[3357.06 → 3358.02] outside
[3358.02 → 3358.34] our own
[3358.34 → 3359.04] experience
[3359.04 → 3360.00] and memory
[3360.00 → 3362.16] look
[3362.16 → 3363.52] if you
[3363.52 → 3364.38] know me
[3364.38 → 3364.74] at all
[3364.74 → 3365.16] you know
[3365.16 → 3365.44] that I
[3365.44 → 3366.10] believe this
[3366.10 → 3366.62] in the
[3366.62 → 3366.82] depths
[3366.82 → 3367.12] of my
[3367.12 → 3367.36] being
[3367.36 → 3367.82] it is
[3367.82 → 3368.32] good
[3368.32 → 3368.94] to be
[3368.94 → 3369.44] skeptical
[3369.44 → 3370.50] it is
[3370.50 → 3370.88] good
[3370.88 → 3371.48] to ask
[3371.48 → 3371.74] hard
[3371.74 → 3372.36] questions
[3372.36 → 3373.26] actually
[3373.26 → 3373.86] part of
[3373.86 → 3374.12] what it
[3374.12 → 3374.56] takes to
[3374.56 → 3375.04] be a good
[3375.04 → 3375.56] historian
[3375.56 → 3376.60] is to
[3376.60 → 3377.10] ask hard
[3377.10 → 3377.64] questions
[3377.64 → 3378.90] is to be
[3378.90 → 3379.26] skeptical
[3379.26 → 3380.06] about your
[3380.06 → 3380.76] first pass
[3380.76 → 3382.84] but the truth
[3382.84 → 3383.66] here is
[3383.66 → 3384.46] that we judge
[3384.46 → 3385.32] any history
[3385.32 → 3386.00] but especially
[3386.00 → 3387.32] ancient history
[3387.32 → 3388.50] based on
[3388.50 → 3389.14] sources
[3389.14 → 3390.12] consistency
[3390.12 → 3390.96] and credibility
[3390.96 → 3392.68] and the
[3392.68 → 3393.42] very same
[3393.42 → 3394.10] standards
[3394.10 → 3394.76] historians
[3394.76 → 3395.42] use for
[3395.42 → 3396.24] any event
[3396.24 → 3397.02] in the
[3397.02 → 3397.76] ancient world
[3397.76 → 3398.70] the gospel
[3398.70 → 3399.12] accounts
[3399.12 → 3399.68] don't just
[3399.68 → 3400.18] hold up
[3400.18 → 3400.36] to
[3400.36 → 3400.82] don't just
[3400.82 → 3401.34] meet them
[3401.34 → 3401.62] but they
[3401.62 → 3402.38] rise above
[3402.38 → 3404.02] right
[3404.02 → 3404.34] Luke's
[3404.34 → 3404.66] account
[3404.66 → 3405.24] is based
[3405.24 → 3406.58] on eyewitnesses
[3406.58 → 3407.28] on early
[3407.28 → 3407.88] testimony
[3407.88 → 3408.30] and on
[3408.30 → 3408.66] careful
[3408.66 → 3409.38] investigation
[3409.38 → 3410.42] he names
[3410.42 → 3410.90] names
[3410.90 → 3411.82] documents
[3411.82 → 3412.42] places
[3412.42 → 3413.10] records
[3413.10 → 3413.56] events
[3413.56 → 3414.24] all of
[3414.24 → 3414.70] which can
[3414.70 → 3415.58] be corroborated
[3415.58 → 3416.18] by extra
[3416.18 → 3416.48] biblical
[3416.48 → 3417.10] sources
[3417.10 → 3417.88] right
[3417.88 → 3418.12] he's
[3418.12 → 3418.38] writing
[3418.38 → 3420.70] not from
[3420.70 → 3421.10] myth
[3421.10 → 3421.72] but from
[3421.72 → 3422.16] memory
[3422.16 → 3423.40] right
[3423.40 → 3423.86] the memory
[3423.86 → 3424.30] of those
[3424.30 → 3424.50] who were
[3424.50 → 3424.80] there
[3424.80 → 3426.08] and if
[3426.08 → 3426.34] you can
[3426.34 → 3426.66] trust
[3426.66 → 3427.50] any history
[3427.50 → 3428.02] at all
[3428.02 → 3428.98] you can
[3428.98 → 3429.22] trust
[3429.22 → 3429.66] this one
[3429.66 → 3432.28] you can
[3432.28 → 3432.64] be a
[3432.64 → 3433.16] skeptic
[3433.16 → 3434.38] but use
[3434.38 → 3434.76] the same
[3434.76 → 3435.22] standard
[3435.22 → 3437.24] that's
[3437.24 → 3437.74] only fair
[3437.74 → 3439.54] and by
[3439.54 → 3440.04] the same
[3440.04 → 3440.64] standard
[3440.64 → 3441.66] the gospel
[3441.66 → 3442.14] accounts
[3442.14 → 3442.56] come out
[3442.56 → 3442.86] ahead
[3442.86 → 3445.26] now
[3445.26 → 3446.60] again
[3446.60 → 3448.10] I want
[3448.10 → 3448.28] to be
[3448.28 → 3448.66] fair
[3448.66 → 3449.60] and I
[3449.60 → 3449.70] want
[3449.70 → 3449.78] to
[3449.78 → 3450.26] anticipate
[3450.26 → 3450.60] really
[3450.60 → 3450.80] good
[3450.80 → 3451.34] questions
[3451.34 → 3452.02] here
[3452.02 → 3452.78] and so
[3452.78 → 3453.10] you might
[3453.10 → 3453.46] hear my
[3453.46 → 3453.86] response
[3453.86 → 3454.20] to that
[3454.20 → 3454.44] and you
[3454.44 → 3454.62] might
[3454.62 → 3454.92] next
[3454.92 → 3455.40] ask
[3455.40 → 3456.54] but how
[3456.54 → 3456.82] do we
[3456.82 → 3457.04] know
[3457.04 → 3457.26] the
[3457.26 → 3458.14] eyewitnesses
[3458.14 → 3458.56] were telling
[3458.56 → 3459.08] the truth
[3459.08 → 3460.46] couldn't
[3460.46 → 3460.80] they have
[3460.80 → 3461.52] misremembered
[3461.52 → 3461.72] couldn't
[3461.72 → 3462.04] they have
[3462.04 → 3462.56] exaggerated
[3462.56 → 3462.88] couldn't
[3462.88 → 3463.22] they have
[3463.22 → 3463.42] made
[3463.42 → 3463.74] it up
[3463.74 → 3465.20] and again
[3465.20 → 3465.78] this digs
[3465.78 → 3466.06] deeper
[3466.06 → 3466.36] this is
[3466.36 → 3466.76] perfect
[3466.76 → 3467.10] work
[3467.10 → 3467.46] right
[3467.46 → 3467.78] this is
[3467.78 → 3468.16] not just
[3468.16 → 3468.40] about
[3468.40 → 3468.64] whether
[3468.64 → 3468.98] Luke
[3468.98 → 3469.48] says
[3469.48 → 3470.00] he did
[3470.00 → 3470.18] the
[3470.18 → 3470.62] research
[3470.62 → 3470.92] it's
[3470.92 → 3471.12] about
[3471.12 → 3471.40] whether
[3471.40 → 3471.86] or not
[3471.86 → 3472.08] his
[3472.08 → 3472.56] sources
[3472.56 → 3473.20] are
[3473.20 → 3473.76] reliable
[3473.76 → 3475.16] right
[3475.16 → 3475.44] in other
[3475.44 → 3475.76] words
[3475.76 → 3476.30] even
[3476.30 → 3476.52] if
[3476.52 → 3476.74] Luke
[3476.74 → 3476.92] is
[3476.92 → 3477.42] careful
[3477.42 → 3477.76] how
[3477.76 → 3478.00] do I
[3478.00 → 3478.16] know
[3478.16 → 3478.36] his
[3478.36 → 3478.76] sources
[3478.76 → 3479.02] are
[3479.02 → 3479.32] credible
[3479.32 → 3480.48] and they're
[3480.48 → 3481.00] not just
[3481.00 → 3481.72] creatively
[3481.72 → 3482.36] mistaken
[3482.36 → 3483.76] or creatively
[3483.76 → 3484.88] mythologizing
[3484.88 → 3486.30] and again
[3486.30 → 3486.98] this is such
[3486.98 → 3487.22] a good
[3487.22 → 3487.68] question
[3487.68 → 3488.28] and I
[3488.28 → 3488.52] love
[3488.52 → 3488.98] this
[3488.98 → 3490.48] right
[3490.48 → 3491.40] to be
[3491.40 → 3491.78] honest
[3491.78 → 3492.28] it's
[3492.28 → 3492.46] also
[3492.46 → 3492.74] a very
[3492.74 → 3493.10] fair
[3493.10 → 3493.62] question
[3493.62 → 3494.96] because
[3494.96 → 3495.46] yeah
[3495.46 → 3496.30] you are
[3496.30 → 3496.62] right
[3496.62 → 3497.20] to say
[3497.20 → 3497.74] that if
[3497.74 → 3498.10] I'm up
[3498.10 → 3498.24] here
[3498.24 → 3498.60] saying
[3498.60 → 3499.26] it's
[3499.26 → 3499.80] eyewitness
[3499.80 → 3500.32] testimony
[3500.32 → 3501.10] that doesn't
[3501.10 → 3501.80] automatically
[3501.80 → 3502.30] make it
[3502.30 → 3502.62] true
[3502.62 → 3503.96] right
[3503.96 → 3504.26] people
[3504.26 → 3505.04] misremember
[3505.04 → 3505.80] people
[3505.80 → 3506.28] lie
[3506.28 → 3507.00] people
[3507.00 → 3507.46] get caught
[3507.46 → 3507.74] up in
[3507.74 → 3508.22] emotion
[3508.22 → 3508.86] right
[3508.86 → 3509.30] how
[3509.30 → 3509.86] how
[3509.86 → 3510.22] can we
[3510.22 → 3510.64] know
[3510.64 → 3511.70] from the
[3511.70 → 3512.06] earliest
[3512.06 → 3512.54] witnesses
[3512.54 → 3513.44] to Jesus
[3513.44 → 3513.96] that they
[3513.96 → 3514.20] weren't
[3514.20 → 3514.44] doing
[3514.44 → 3514.82] that
[3514.82 → 3515.98] how can
[3515.98 → 3516.08] we
[3516.08 → 3516.28] trust
[3516.28 → 3516.60] them
[3516.60 → 3519.62] here's
[3519.62 → 3520.12] my first
[3520.12 → 3521.22] step
[3521.22 → 3521.46] in an
[3521.46 → 3521.74] answer
[3521.74 → 3525.42] because
[3525.42 → 3526.50] these
[3526.50 → 3527.06] weren't
[3527.06 → 3527.50] just

[3779.40 → 3780.98] this
[3780.98 → 3781.68] truth
[3781.68 → 3782.18] that
[3782.18 → 3782.60] Jesus
[3782.60 → 3783.58] came
[3783.58 → 3784.00] into
[3784.00 → 3784.34] this
[3784.34 → 3784.90] world

[3786.68 → 3786.88] the
[3786.88 → 3787.20] trinity
[3787.20 → 3787.56] and
[3787.56 → 3787.82] took
[3787.82 → 3788.08] on
[3788.08 → 3788.58] flesh
[3788.58 → 3789.02] and
[3789.02 → 3789.36] lived
[3789.36 → 3789.52] the
[3789.52 → 3789.78] life
[3789.78 → 3789.96] I
[3789.96 → 3790.16] should
[3790.16 → 3790.30] have
[3790.30 → 3790.62] lived
[3790.62 → 3790.82] and
[3790.82 → 3791.18] died
[3791.18 → 3791.38] the
[3791.38 → 3791.66] death
[3791.66 → 3792.02] that
[3792.02 → 3792.16] I
[3792.16 → 3792.60] deserved
[3792.60 → 3792.96] that
[3792.96 → 3793.20] this
[3793.20 → 3793.60] Jesus
[3793.60 → 3793.98] three
[3793.98 → 3794.32] days
[3794.32 → 3794.66] later
[3794.66 → 3794.90] was
[3794.90 → 3795.38] raised
[3795.38 → 3795.68] from
[3795.68 → 3795.88] the
[3795.88 → 3796.08] dead
[3796.08 → 3796.90] victorious
[3796.90 → 3797.44] over
[3797.44 → 3797.82] sin
[3797.82 → 3798.08] and
[3798.08 → 3798.30] death
[3798.30 → 3799.02] this
[3799.02 → 3799.96] truth
[3799.96 → 3802.46] changes
[3802.46 → 3804.18] everything
[3804.18 → 3806.10] so
[3806.10 → 3806.58] humbly
[3806.58 → 3807.72] and
[3807.72 → 3808.42] pastorally
[3808.42 → 3810.18] may I
[3810.18 → 3810.62] suggest
[3810.62 → 3811.16] to you
[3811.16 → 3812.46] that the
[3812.46 → 3813.06] reason
[3813.06 → 3814.08] behind
[3814.08 → 3814.54] the
[3814.54 → 3815.02] reason
[3815.02 → 3815.68] of
[3815.68 → 3816.58] skeptic
[3816.58 → 3817.14] challenges
[3817.14 → 3817.80] to the
[3817.80 → 3818.12] truth
[3818.12 → 3818.48] of the
[3818.48 → 3818.84] gospel
[3818.84 → 3819.28] account
[3819.28 → 3819.70] the
[3819.70 → 3820.10] reason
[3820.10 → 3820.68] behind
[3820.68 → 3821.00] the
[3821.00 → 3821.44] reason
[3821.44 → 3822.22] isn't
[3822.22 → 3822.74] because
[3822.74 → 3823.02] it's
[3823.02 → 3823.20] an
[3823.20 → 3823.72] unlikely
[3823.72 → 3824.60] history
[3824.60 → 3826.66] instead
[3826.66 → 3828.42] it's
[3828.42 → 3828.64] because
[3828.64 → 3829.08] if this
[3829.08 → 3829.72] is true
[3829.72 → 3830.54] really
[3830.54 → 3831.04] true
[3831.04 → 3832.12] then
[3832.12 → 3833.02] everything
[3833.02 → 3833.92] must
[3833.92 → 3834.56] change
[3834.56 → 3836.50] if
[3836.50 → 3836.88] Jesus
[3836.88 → 3837.20] is
[3837.20 → 3837.50] really
[3837.50 → 3837.88] raised
[3837.88 → 3838.12] from
[3838.12 → 3838.28] the
[3838.28 → 3838.54] dead
[3838.54 → 3838.92] then
[3838.92 → 3839.06] I
[3839.06 → 3839.24] should
[3839.24 → 3839.56] listen
[3839.56 → 3839.70] to
[3839.70 → 3839.92] him
[3839.92 → 3840.74] and
[3840.74 → 3840.86] if
[3840.86 → 3841.00] I
[3841.00 → 3841.20] should
[3841.20 → 3841.54] listen
[3841.54 → 3841.72] to
[3841.72 → 3842.02] him
[3842.02 → 3842.42] if
[3842.42 → 3842.56] he
[3842.56 → 3842.86] really
[3842.86 → 3843.20] does
[3843.20 → 3843.38] have
[3843.38 → 3843.52] the
[3843.52 → 3843.84] words
[3843.84 → 3843.98] of
[3843.98 → 3844.30] eternal
[3844.30 → 3844.62] life
[3844.62 → 3844.94] then
[3844.94 → 3845.04] I
[3845.04 → 3845.18] must
[3845.18 → 3845.56] trust
[3845.56 → 3845.88] him
[3845.88 → 3847.58] and
[3847.58 → 3847.76] it's
[3847.76 → 3848.08] this
[3848.08 → 3848.60] move
[3848.60 → 3849.02] right
[3849.02 → 3849.30] this
[3849.30 → 3849.62] move
[3849.62 → 3849.90] from
[3849.90 → 3850.86] reliability
[3850.86 → 3851.90] to
[3851.90 → 3852.64] trustworthy
[3852.64 → 3853.70] that
[3853.70 → 3854.36] faith
[3854.36 → 3854.86] is
[3854.86 → 3855.16] found
[3855.16 → 3855.46] in
[3855.46 → 3857.80] right
[3857.80 → 3858.22] even
[3858.22 → 3858.96] skeptical
[3858.96 → 3859.46] and
[3859.46 → 3859.88] secular
[3859.88 → 3860.54] scholars
[3860.54 → 3860.94] agree
[3860.94 → 3861.18] that
[3861.18 → 3861.48] most
[3861.48 → 3861.80] of what
[3861.80 → 3861.92] is

[3862.10 → 3862.34] about
[3862.34 → 3862.66] Jesus
[3862.66 → 3862.84] and
[3862.84 → 3862.98] the
[3862.98 → 3863.38] gospels
[3863.38 → 3863.84] is
[3863.84 → 3864.20] true
[3864.20 → 3864.72] it's
[3864.72 → 3865.22] reliable
[3865.22 → 3865.82] history

[3894.54 → 3895.06] classes
[3895.06 → 3896.60] I
[3896.60 → 3896.86] can't
[3896.86 → 3897.04] say
[3897.04 → 3897.18] it
[3897.18 → 3897.36] better
[3897.36 → 3897.54] than
[3897.54 → 3897.68] the

[3898.12 → 3898.38] does
[3898.38 → 3898.50] and
[3898.50 → 3898.58] so

[3913.50 → 3913.82] revealed
[3913.82 → 3914.02] to
[3914.02 → 3914.22] us
[3914.22 → 3914.38] in
[3914.38 → 3914.68] scripture
[3914.68 → 3915.40] it
[3915.40 → 3915.60] is
[3915.60 → 3916.06] also
[3916.06 → 3916.44] a

[3916.80 → 3917.36] hearted
[3917.36 → 3917.88] trust
[3917.88 → 3918.92] which
[3918.92 → 3919.10] the
[3919.10 → 3919.32] Holy
[3919.32 → 3919.68] Spirit
[3919.68 → 3920.26] creates
[3920.26 → 3920.46] in
[3920.46 → 3920.78] me
[3920.78 → 3921.28] by
[3921.28 → 3921.44] the

[3921.82 → 3923.20] true

[3928.56 → 3928.90] rooted
[3928.90 → 3929.38] assurance
[3929.38 → 3929.74] and
[3929.74 → 3929.94] we
[3929.94 → 3930.24] need
[3930.24 → 3930.68] both
[3930.68 → 3932.90] and

[3933.94 → 3935.86] in
[3935.86 → 3936.00] a
[3936.00 → 3936.38] world
[3936.38 → 3936.68] that
[3936.68 → 3937.20] feels
[3937.20 → 3937.90] slippery
[3937.90 → 3938.56] and
[3938.56 → 3938.70] where
[3938.70 → 3939.12] trust
[3939.12 → 3939.40] is

[3957.00 → 3957.22] the
[3957.22 → 3957.62] gospel
[3957.62 → 3958.10] is
[3958.10 → 3958.26] that
[3958.26 → 3958.60] it
[3958.60 → 3958.98] isn't
[3958.98 → 3959.24] just
[3959.24 → 3959.72] true
[3959.72 → 3960.68] it's

[3966.08 → 3966.90] in
[3966.90 → 3967.08] your
[3967.08 → 3967.40] heart
[3967.40 → 3968.84] the
[3968.84 → 3969.22] gospel
[3969.22 → 3969.62] isn't
[3969.62 → 3969.86] just
[3969.86 → 3970.26] true
[3970.26 → 3970.64] it's
[3970.64 → 3971.06] secure
[3971.06 → 3971.56] and
[3971.56 → 3971.70] the
[3971.70 → 3971.90] Holy
[3971.90 → 3972.24] Spirit
[3972.24 → 3972.50] makes

[3973.20 → 3973.44] and
[3973.44 → 3973.84] firm
[3973.84 → 3974.08] and
[3974.08 → 3974.58] trustworthy
[3974.58 → 3975.36] in
[3975.36 → 3975.54] your
[3975.54 → 3975.86] heart
[3975.86 → 3979.02] imagine
[3979.02 → 3980.42] that you're
[3980.42 → 3981.04] standing on
[3981.04 → 3981.34] the edge
[3981.34 → 3981.58] of a
[3981.58 → 3981.96] canyon
[3981.96 → 3982.90] and there's
[3982.90 → 3983.40] a bridge
[3983.40 → 3984.10] that spans
[3984.10 → 3984.70] the gap
[3984.70 → 3986.14] and you've
[3986.14 → 3986.68] studied this
[3986.68 → 3987.06] bridge
[3987.06 → 3988.76] the engineering
[3988.76 → 3989.48] checks out
[3989.48 → 3990.76] the steel
[3990.76 → 3991.70] cables look
[3991.70 → 3992.44] strong enough
[3992.44 → 3993.26] the bolts
[3993.26 → 3993.88] holding it
[3993.88 → 3994.72] to the bedrock
[3994.72 → 3995.52] look sound
[3995.52 → 3995.84] enough
[3995.84 → 3996.60] you've even
[3996.60 → 3997.26] watched other
[3997.26 → 3998.04] people cross
[3998.04 → 3999.24] you know
[3999.24 → 4000.10] in your
[4000.10 → 4000.60] head
[4000.60 → 4001.40] that you can
[4001.40 → 4002.20] take a step
[4002.20 → 4002.98] out onto
[4002.98 → 4003.56] the bridge
[4003.56 → 4004.40] but until
[4004.40 → 4005.02] your weight
[4005.02 → 4005.50] is on
[4005.50 → 4006.06] that bridge
[4006.06 → 4006.70] you haven't
[4006.70 → 4007.10] actually
[4007.10 → 4007.90] trusted it
[4007.90 → 4008.34] yet
[4008.34 → 4013.10] it's not
[4013.10 → 4013.46] enough just
[4013.46 → 4013.90] to know
[4013.90 → 4014.26] that it
[4014.26 → 4014.74] holds
[4014.74 → 4016.38] but if we
[4016.38 → 4017.18] step out
[4017.18 → 4018.40] because we
[4018.40 → 4018.98] believe
[4018.98 → 4019.70] we trust
[4019.70 → 4020.40] that it
[4020.40 → 4020.72] will hold
[4020.72 → 4021.04] us
[4021.04 → 4023.34] a little
[4023.34 → 4023.86] while ago
[4023.86 → 4025.40] my family
[4025.40 → 4026.24] and some
[4026.24 → 4026.66] friends
[4026.66 → 4027.08] we went
[4027.08 → 4027.38] to
[4027.38 → 4028.16] Cascade
[4028.16 → 4028.60] Falls
[4028.60 → 4029.30] suspension
[4029.30 → 4029.72] bridge
[4029.72 → 4030.88] just north
[4030.88 → 4031.04] of
[4031.04 → 4031.32] Mission
[4031.32 → 4032.02] maybe
[4032.02 → 4032.30] you're
[4032.30 → 4032.74] familiar
[4032.74 → 4033.06] with it
[4033.06 → 4033.28] I think
[4033.28 → 4033.46] we have
[4033.46 → 4033.86] a picture
[4033.86 → 4034.94] that we
[4034.94 → 4035.28] can throw
[4035.28 → 4035.48] up
[4035.48 → 4036.22] and it
[4036.22 → 4036.82] was really
[4036.82 → 4037.52] fascinating
[4037.52 → 4038.64] to watch
[4038.64 → 4039.30] the younger
[4039.30 → 4039.86] kids
[4039.86 → 4040.56] figure out
[4040.56 → 4041.16] this bridge
[4041.16 → 4042.94] right
[4042.94 → 4043.26] they could
[4043.26 → 4043.80] see that
[4043.80 → 4044.08] it was
[4044.08 → 4044.52] safe
[4044.52 → 4045.26] because
[4045.26 → 4045.64] you know
[4045.64 → 4045.96] we all
[4045.96 → 4046.20] walked
[4046.20 → 4046.56] across
[4046.56 → 4046.80] it
[4046.80 → 4047.98] their brains
[4047.98 → 4048.42] knew it
[4048.42 → 4048.94] was safe
[4048.94 → 4050.44] but their
[4050.44 → 4050.82] legs
[4050.82 → 4051.36] as they
[4051.36 → 4051.90] tried to
[4051.90 → 4052.20] go
[4052.20 → 4053.58] wouldn't
[4053.58 → 4054.16] believe
[4054.16 → 4054.64] that it
[4054.64 → 4055.16] was safe
[4055.16 → 4056.66] wouldn't
[4056.66 → 4057.08] trust
[4057.08 → 4057.76] that it
[4057.76 → 4058.22] was safe
[4058.22 → 4058.76] and their
[4058.76 → 4059.04] legs
[4059.04 → 4059.32] didn't
[4059.32 → 4059.72] get that
[4059.72 → 4060.06] message
[4060.06 → 4060.40] until
[4060.40 → 4060.56] they
[4060.56 → 4060.70] were
[4060.70 → 4061.04] halfway
[4061.04 → 4061.62] across
[4061.62 → 4062.76] and could
[4062.76 → 4063.12] stand
[4063.12 → 4063.44] there
[4063.44 → 4064.24] and test
[4064.24 → 4064.40] it
[4064.40 → 4064.58] and be
[4064.58 → 4064.74] like
[4064.74 → 4064.96] hey
[4064.96 → 4065.58] this
[4065.58 → 4065.90] actually
[4065.90 → 4066.32] works
[4066.32 → 4068.94] that's
[4068.94 → 4069.10] what
[4069.10 → 4069.46] faith
[4069.46 → 4069.86] feels
[4069.86 → 4070.16] like
[4070.16 → 4070.78] sometimes
[4070.78 → 4072.74] right
[4072.74 → 4072.92] true
[4072.92 → 4073.18] faith
[4073.18 → 4073.48] isn't
[4073.48 → 4073.66] just
[4073.66 → 4074.08] knowing
[4074.08 → 4074.44] that
[4074.44 → 4074.60] the
[4074.60 → 4074.86] bridge
[4074.86 → 4075.12] is
[4075.12 → 4075.50] sound
[4075.50 → 4075.80] it's
[4075.80 → 4076.12] walking
[4076.12 → 4076.64] across
[4076.64 → 4078.30] and at
[4078.30 → 4078.62] the risk
[4078.62 → 4079.10] of stretching
[4079.10 → 4079.72] this analogy
[4079.72 → 4080.40] too far
[4080.40 → 4081.66] the littlest
[4081.66 → 4082.22] among us
[4082.22 → 4082.86] just couldn't
[4082.86 → 4083.24] do it
[4083.24 → 4084.78] they needed
[4084.78 → 4085.28] to be picked
[4085.28 → 4085.66] up and
[4085.66 → 4086.00] carried
[4086.00 → 4089.42] but that's
[4089.42 → 4089.66] the other
[4089.66 → 4090.50] beautiful reality
[4090.50 → 4091.42] that's going
[4091.42 → 4091.88] on here
[4091.88 → 4093.42] right
[4093.42 → 4093.98] true faith
[4093.98 → 4094.26] is a
[4094.26 → 4094.70] wholehearted
[4094.70 → 4095.26] trust
[4095.26 → 4095.70] which the
[4095.70 → 4096.40] Holy Spirit
[4096.40 → 4097.16] creates in
[4097.16 → 4097.46] me
[4097.46 → 4098.22] by the
[4098.22 → 4098.62] gospel
[4098.62 → 4099.32] that's
[4099.32 → 4099.78] why we
[4099.78 → 4100.22] read
[4100.22 → 4100.58] acts
[4100.58 → 4100.96] two
[4100.96 → 4102.66] right
[4102.66 → 4103.18] the move
[4103.18 → 4103.46] from
[4103.46 → 4104.04] reliability
[4104.04 → 4104.88] to
[4104.88 → 4105.48] trustworthy
[4105.48 → 4106.04] from
[4106.04 → 4106.62] certainty
[4106.62 → 4106.94] to
[4106.94 → 4107.54] security
[4107.54 → 4108.16] from
[4108.16 → 4108.54] head
[4108.54 → 4108.88] to
[4108.88 → 4109.30] heart
[4109.30 → 4110.10] requires
[4110.10 → 4110.86] in us
[4110.86 → 4111.26] the work
[4111.26 → 4111.48] of the
[4111.48 → 4111.68] holy
[4111.68 → 4112.10] spirit
[4112.10 → 4113.76] in the
[4113.76 → 4114.42] last days
[4114.42 → 4114.74] God
[4114.74 → 4115.06] says
[4115.06 → 4115.42] I will
[4115.42 → 4115.76] pour
[4115.76 → 4116.00] out
[4116.00 → 4116.26] my
[4116.26 → 4116.70] spirit
[4116.70 → 4116.96] on
[4116.96 → 4117.36] all
[4117.36 → 4118.12] people
[4118.12 → 4119.28] I will
[4119.28 → 4119.50] show
[4119.50 → 4120.10] wonders
[4120.10 → 4120.78] in the
[4120.78 → 4121.00] heavens
[4121.00 → 4121.36] above
[4121.36 → 4121.94] and signs
[4121.94 → 4122.24] on the
[4122.24 → 4122.44] earth
[4122.44 → 4122.76] below
[4122.76 → 4123.42] and everyone
[4123.42 → 4124.10] who calls
[4124.10 → 4124.36] on the
[4124.36 → 4124.64] name
[4124.64 → 4124.90] of the
[4124.90 → 4125.22] Lord
[4125.22 → 4126.14] will be
[4126.14 → 4126.86] saved
[4126.86 → 4131.86] look
[4131.86 → 4134.40] this is
[4134.40 → 4135.02] where I'm
[4135.02 → 4135.36] in my

[4141.68 → 4141.88] been
[4141.88 → 4142.34] praying

[4150.22 → 4150.72] to really
[4150.72 → 4151.28] trust
[4151.28 → 4152.58] so that I
[4152.58 → 4153.24] go places
[4153.24 → 4153.66] I'm not
[4153.66 → 4154.04] prepared

[4154.40 → 4155.64] help me
[4155.64 → 4155.98] to ask
[4155.98 → 4156.44] questions
[4156.44 → 4156.86] I don't
[4156.86 → 4157.16] know the
[4157.16 → 4157.48] answers
[4157.48 → 4157.74] to

[4158.98 → 4159.54] to walk
[4159.54 → 4160.14] with people
[4160.14 → 4160.76] I don't
[4160.76 → 4161.18] already
[4161.18 → 4161.70] know
[4161.70 → 4162.28] and to
[4162.28 → 4162.80] tell them
[4162.80 → 4163.04] about
[4163.04 → 4163.46] Jesus
[4163.46 → 4164.26] and the
[4164.26 → 4164.64] gospel
[4164.64 → 4169.44] this week
[4169.44 → 4170.24] a man
[4170.24 → 4170.56] that I
[4170.56 → 4170.96] consider
[4170.96 → 4171.50] a mentor
[4171.50 → 4172.50] and a
[4172.50 → 4172.84] teacher
[4172.84 → 4174.38] he asked
[4174.38 → 4174.72] a group
[4174.72 → 4175.06] of us
[4175.06 → 4175.44] pastors
[4175.44 → 4176.20] who had
[4176.20 → 4176.50] gathered
[4176.50 → 4176.94] together
[4176.94 → 4177.88] he asked
[4177.88 → 4179.74] do we
[4179.74 → 4180.20] really
[4180.20 → 4180.70] believe
[4180.70 → 4181.62] that Jesus
[4181.62 → 4182.54] invitation
[4182.54 → 4183.60] to come
[4183.60 → 4184.24] and follow
[4184.24 → 4184.56] him
[4184.56 → 4185.78] is the
[4185.78 → 4186.14] best
[4186.14 → 4186.66] news
[4186.66 → 4187.12] ever
[4187.12 → 4190.34] do I
[4190.34 → 4190.68] really
[4190.68 → 4191.08] believe
[4191.08 → 4191.92] that following
[4191.92 → 4192.34] Jesus
[4192.34 → 4192.80] is the
[4192.80 → 4193.34] the best thing
[4193.34 → 4193.86] for me
[4193.86 → 4194.54] and for
[4194.54 → 4194.92] everyone
[4194.92 → 4195.24] in the
[4195.24 → 4195.50] world
[4195.50 → 4196.62] and if
[4196.62 → 4197.24] I really
[4197.24 → 4197.74] believed
[4197.74 → 4198.12] that
[4198.12 → 4199.76] would
[4199.76 → 4199.94] my
[4199.94 → 4200.26] life
[4200.26 → 4200.48] look
[4200.48 → 4200.68] the
[4200.68 → 4201.00] same
[4201.00 → 4201.18] as
[4201.18 → 4201.32] it
[4201.32 → 4201.60] currently
[4201.60 → 4201.96] does
[4201.96 → 4205.62] I
[4205.62 → 4206.16] believe
[4206.16 → 4207.74] I
[4207.74 → 4207.92] want
[4207.92 → 4208.10] more
[4208.10 → 4208.64] trust
[4208.64 → 4214.44] and here's
[4214.44 → 4215.00] the hope
[4215.00 → 4215.68] that we
[4215.68 → 4216.16] cling to
[4216.16 → 4216.88] okay
[4216.88 → 4219.76] because even
[4219.76 → 4220.44] as we pray
[4220.44 → 4221.10] I believe
[4221.10 → 4221.50] help my
[4221.50 → 4222.02] unbelief
[4222.02 → 4222.84] even as
[4222.84 → 4223.38] we pray
[4223.38 → 4224.16] I know
[4224.16 → 4224.80] help me
[4224.80 → 4225.42] to trust
[4225.42 → 4226.32] even as
[4226.32 → 4227.20] we dive
[4227.20 → 4228.24] into this
[4228.24 → 4229.28] truth and
[4229.28 → 4230.26] reality of
[4230.26 → 4230.98] true faith
[4230.98 → 4232.06] let's also
[4232.06 → 4233.08] realize and
[4233.08 → 4233.74] see that
[4233.74 → 4234.48] faith
[4234.48 → 4235.62] isn't our
[4235.62 → 4236.02] own
[4236.02 → 4236.62] achievement
[4236.62 → 4237.48] faith
[4237.48 → 4238.64] is a
[4238.64 → 4239.16] gift
[4239.16 → 4240.70] right the
[4240.70 → 4241.54] Holy Spirit
[4241.54 → 4242.16] doesn't just
[4242.16 → 4243.00] explain the
[4243.00 → 4243.60] gospel to
[4243.60 → 4244.26] us he
[4244.26 → 4245.10] awakens us
[4245.10 → 4245.56] to it
[4245.56 → 4247.12] the Holy Spirit
[4247.12 → 4247.64] doesn't just
[4247.64 → 4248.52] inform us
[4248.52 → 4249.24] he transforms
[4249.24 → 4249.88] us
[4249.88 → 4251.16] and it's the
[4251.16 → 4251.92] Spirit who
[4251.92 → 4252.56] opens your
[4252.56 → 4253.34] eyes who
[4253.34 → 4254.28] softens our
[4254.28 → 4254.80] hearts and
[4254.80 → 4255.22] who gives
[4255.22 → 4255.64] us the
[4255.64 → 4256.34] strength to
[4256.34 → 4256.90] step out
[4256.90 → 4257.44] onto that
[4257.44 → 4258.52] bridge even
[4258.52 → 4259.04] when our
[4259.04 → 4260.14] knees shake
[4260.14 → 4261.06] the Spirit
[4261.06 → 4262.52] steadies us
[4262.52 → 4264.96] and so
[4264.96 → 4265.66] how do we
[4265.66 → 4266.16] respond
[4266.16 → 4268.22] how do we
[4268.22 → 4268.94] respond today
[4268.94 → 4271.96] if it's the
[4271.96 → 4272.92] Spirit who
[4272.92 → 4273.62] gives faith
[4273.62 → 4274.08] then we
[4274.08 → 4274.86] must ask
[4274.86 → 4276.38] we must
[4276.38 → 4276.86] seek
[4276.86 → 4277.80] we must
[4277.80 → 4278.48] welcome
[4278.48 → 4279.18] him
[4279.18 → 4280.02] and that
[4280.02 → 4280.48] doesn't mean
[4280.48 → 4281.10] trying to
[4281.10 → 4282.02] manufacture an
[4282.02 → 4282.46] emotional
[4282.46 → 4283.18] moment
[4283.18 → 4283.92] it means
[4283.92 → 4284.40] placing
[4284.40 → 4284.94] yourself
[4284.94 → 4285.96] again and
[4285.96 → 4286.54] again and
[4286.54 → 4287.34] again where
[4287.34 → 4287.88] the Spirit
[4287.88 → 4288.68] loves to
[4288.68 → 4289.14] work and
[4289.14 → 4289.82] promises to
[4289.82 → 4290.08] be
[4290.08 → 4291.58] in the
[4291.58 → 4291.92] Word
[4291.92 → 4293.34] in prayer
[4293.34 → 4294.38] in worship
[4294.38 → 4295.16] in the
[4295.16 → 4295.48] Christian
[4295.48 → 4296.02] community
[4296.02 → 4296.84] together
[4296.84 → 4297.68] the Spirit
[4297.68 → 4298.44] uses these
[4298.44 → 4299.44] ordinary means
[4299.44 → 4299.84] to do
[4299.84 → 4300.38] extraordinary
[4300.38 → 4301.04] things
[4301.04 → 4301.90] to carry
[4301.90 → 4302.40] us when
[4302.40 → 4303.18] we can't
[4303.18 → 4303.56] walk
[4303.56 → 4304.02] to keep
[4304.02 → 4304.62] us growing
[4304.62 → 4305.66] in wholehearted
[4305.66 → 4306.70] trust in
[4306.70 → 4307.06] Jesus
[4307.06 → 4309.42] if you
[4309.42 → 4310.00] are wondering
[4310.00 → 4313.60] if you
[4313.60 → 4313.98] are trying
[4313.98 → 4314.42] to grab
[4314.42 → 4314.84] hold of
[4314.84 → 4315.18] a truth
[4315.18 → 4315.62] that feels
[4315.62 → 4316.14] slippery
[4316.14 → 4318.18] if you
[4318.18 → 4318.76] are aching
[4318.76 → 4319.46] for something
[4319.46 → 4320.00] firm
[4320.00 → 4321.64] I just want

[4454.36 → 4455.98] may we
[4455.98 → 4456.44] hear your
[4456.44 → 4456.94] voice
[4456.94 → 4459.30] may we
[4459.30 → 4459.86] know that

[4477.88 → 4478.32] the bread
[4478.32 → 4478.90] and the
[4478.90 → 4479.20] wine
[4479.20 → 4482.24] that here
[4482.24 → 4483.24] we might

[4531.56 → 4531.86] heaven

[4558.58 → 4559.44] our
[4559.44 → 4559.58] Lord
[4559.58 → 4559.98] Jesus
[4559.98 → 4561.08] before
[4561.08 → 4561.60] he
[4561.60 → 4562.22] suffered
[4562.22 → 4562.64] gave
[4562.64 → 4563.00] us
[4563.00 → 4563.30] this
[4563.30 → 4563.92] memorial
[4563.92 → 4564.68] of his
[4564.68 → 4565.64] sacrifice
[4565.64 → 4566.24] until
[4566.24 → 4566.46] he
[4566.46 → 4566.78] comes
[4566.78 → 4567.18] again
[4567.18 → 4568.50] the
[4568.50 → 4568.72] Lord
[4568.72 → 4569.10] Jesus
[4569.10 → 4569.66] on the
[4569.66 → 4569.88] night
[4569.88 → 4570.04] that
[4570.04 → 4570.14] he
[4570.14 → 4570.34] was
[4570.34 → 4570.82] betrayed
[4570.82 → 4571.44] took
[4571.44 → 4571.82] bread
[4571.82 → 4576.14] and
[4576.14 → 4576.26] when
[4576.26 → 4576.34] he
[4576.34 → 4576.68] broke
[4576.68 → 4577.00] it
[4577.00 → 4578.20] and
[4578.20 → 4578.38] given
[4578.38 → 4578.96] thanks
[4578.96 → 4579.28] he
[4579.28 → 4579.68] said
[4579.68 → 4580.26] this
[4580.26 → 4580.60] is
[4580.60 → 4580.84] my
[4580.84 → 4581.28] body
[4581.28 → 4582.00] which
[4582.00 → 4582.18] is
[4582.18 → 4582.36] for
[4582.36 → 4582.60] you
[4582.60 → 4591.80] do this in remembrance of me. In the same way, he took the cup after supper saying,
[4592.28 → 4595.30] this cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[4598.46 → 4606.14] Do this whenever you drink it in remembrance of me. For whenever you eat this bread and drink
[4606.14 → 4615.38] this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again. This then is the mystery of our faith.
[4616.38 → 4625.36] Your death, O Christ, we proclaim. Your resurrection we affirm with joy. You're coming we await with hope.
[4626.18 → 4635.84] Glory be to you, Lord Jesus. Church family, the Lord has prepared his table for all who love him
[4635.84 → 4642.98] and for all who trust in him alone for their salvation. And so come to this table, you who
[4642.98 → 4649.40] have much faith and you who would like to have more. Come to this table, you who have been to this
[4649.40 → 4655.16] sacrament often and you who have not been for a long time. Come to this table, you who have tried
[4655.16 → 4664.22] to follow Jesus and who have failed. Come to this table because Jesus Christ is raised and the spirit
[4664.22 → 4671.98] has come. Come to this table, whether you are here with us in person or joining us online, because it is
[4671.98 → 4683.46] Christ who invites us to meet him here. These are the gifts of God for the people of God. Amen.
[4683.46 → 4693.32] As we come to the table, this morning we are going to do that, gathering in groups, in a circle, joined
[4693.32 → 4701.40] together around the table. And so we will have elders who will work as ushers, indicating when it's
[4701.40 → 4707.64] time for your row to come up to the front. We encourage you to come up to the front and gather in a circle
[4707.64 → 4713.66] together. And then we will pass the bread to our left or to our right. And as you pass the bread,
[4713.76 → 4719.78] I invite you to say, the body of Christ given for you. And then we will pass the juice to our left or
[4719.78 → 4725.24] to our right. And as you pass the juice, I will invite you to say, the blood of Christ shed for you.
[4726.04 → 4730.44] If you are unable to come up to the front for whatever reason, please just indicate that to the
[4730.44 → 4736.48] elder, and they will serve you in your seat where you are. If you are coming up, and would like to
[4736.48 → 4742.76] have gluten-free bread, please know that in the centre of each tray is a cup of gluten-free bread.
[4743.20 → 4747.96] And if you are celiac and don't want the risk of cross-contamination, we have a totally separate
[4747.96 → 4754.78] container of bread up here for you as well. For our first table, I want to invite the
[4754.78 → 4760.16] worship volunteers who will help us and sing with us, the prayer volunteers who will be available
[4760.16 → 4764.94] while we are doing the supper. If you want to be prayed with or over celebration and lament,
[4764.94 → 4770.72] there's people available for that. They'll be in the foyer and the elders as well who are going to
[4770.72 → 4775.24] help us serve. Come to the front. They will serve our first table and then we will continue through.
[4794.94 → 4797.76] Come right in, Megan. Close the circle.
[4803.52 → 4809.22] Body of Christ given for you. Amen. Body of Christ given for you.
