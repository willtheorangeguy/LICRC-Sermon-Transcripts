[0.00 → 14.00] I appreciate hearing what people are saying.
[14.00 → 39.00] See those guys down by shoаются and непω he Tie glass.
[39.00 → 46.00] I've got every city, yes he did, so yes he can.
[46.00 → 50.00] Oh, did he have deep to the neck?
[50.00 → 52.00] Did he do it for me?
[52.00 → 57.00] Yes he did, so yes he can.
[57.00 → 63.00] Oh, yes he did, so yes he can.
[63.00 → 68.00] Sometimes his voice is trying to tell me.
[68.00 → 71.00] I'm going to eat sardines.
[98.00 → 101.00] Did he do it for the neck?
[101.00 → 103.00] Did he deliver me?
[103.00 → 108.00] Yes he did, so yes he can.
[108.00 → 114.00] Oh, yes he did, so yes he can.
[114.00 → 120.00] I was out so many words, now I can't deny.
[120.00 → 126.00] He's come through every single time.
[126.00 → 131.00] From the beginning until the end.
[131.00 → 136.00] He did, he will, he can.
[136.00 → 141.00] Now I'm going to be so good.
[141.00 → 144.00] Did he move every mountain?
[144.00 → 146.00] Did he part every sea?
[146.00 → 151.00] Yes he did, so yes he can.
[151.00 → 155.00] Oh, did he do, did he do darkness?
[155.00 → 158.00] Did he feel it for me?
[158.00 → 161.00] Oh, God, I'm so sorry to love you.
[161.00 → 164.00] Good morning.
[166.00 → 168.00] Welcome to church.
[168.00 → 172.00] A special welcome if you are a guest with us this morning.
[172.00 → 178.00] My name is Chris and I have the distinct pleasure of being one of the pastors here at Emanuel Church.
[178.00 → 182.00] We're really excited for today's worship service.
[182.00 → 187.00] Part of our service today, we're going to have some baptism and new member welcome,
[187.00 → 189.00] and so we are grateful to God for that.
[189.00 → 195.00] If you are a guest here to celebrate with us in that, we're really excited that you are here as well.
[195.00 → 202.00] Before we begin in earnest, and as we've got people filing in yet, just one announcement to make.
[202.00 → 211.00] We are still looking for a couple volunteers to lead our children's worship time during the summer months.
[211.00 → 217.00] And so during the summer months, preschool to kindergarten kids at some point in our worship head out,
[217.00 → 219.00] and they have their own time together.
[219.00 → 225.00] And we need three Sundays in August filled for teachers.
[225.00 → 231.00] We do have a couple younger volunteers for those, but we could use a few more there as well.
[231.00 → 236.00] So if you're interested in that, the sign-up sheet is going to be at the Connect booth following our service.
[236.00 → 239.00] It's also in the e-bulletin if you get that.
[239.00 → 242.00] You can click through the link there and sign up.
[242.00 → 245.00] And so that's three Sundays in August.
[245.00 → 247.00] I would really love to fill that out.
[247.00 → 250.00] Hopefully even by the end of today.
[250.00 → 251.00] As far as announcements go, that's it.
[251.00 → 252.00] It's summer.
[252.00 → 255.00] So there's not a lot of others happening here.
[255.00 → 262.00] So I'm going to invite you as you're able to stand that we can be ushered into God's presence together.
[262.00 → 268.00] When we gather for worship, we know that God is among us because Jesus promised that his spirit would be here.
[268.00 → 270.00] And we mark that presence.
[270.00 → 275.00] We invite that presence by receiving the greeting of our God.
[275.00 → 279.00] And so receive God's greeting as we gather in worship this morning.
[279.00 → 287.00] Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Saviour,
[287.00 → 290.00] through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[290.00 → 291.00] Amen.
[291.00 → 296.00] As God has welcomed us, I invite you to turn to those around you and welcome them in worship as well.
[296.00 → 297.00] Yes.
[297.00 → 298.00] Ma'am.
[298.00 → 299.00] No.
[299.00 → 300.00] Nice to meet you.
[300.00 → 301.00] Nice to meet you.
[301.00 → 302.00] How are you?

[338.00 → 340.00] we gather this morning to honour our King,
[340.00 → 342.00] who walked on this earth as a man,
[342.00 → 344.00] yet created the very ground his feet touched,
[344.00 → 346.00] who is tempted by every sin,
[346.00 → 348.00] yet remained sinless, who is tried
[348.00 → 350.00] by the law, yet fulfilled it,
[350.00 → 352.00] who died on the cross, yet called people
[352.00 → 354.00] of graves and conquered death itself.

[833.08 → 841.90] His body bound and drenched in tears
[841.90 → 847.78] They laid him down in juice as dew

[1044.68 → 1051.68] O Lord, O Lord our God.
[1051.68 → 1059.52] As we enter into this time of confession, you may be seated.
[1073.90 → 1077.02] The psalmist wrote in Psalm 92,
[1077.02 → 1081.68] It is good to praise the Lord.
[1083.18 → 1087.30] We sang of the one who has numbered every grain of sand,
[1088.06 → 1091.46] the one who is holy and mighty and worthy of praise,
[1092.82 → 1096.92] the one who conquered death and calls you to new life.
[1098.38 → 1100.68] What's holding you back from following him?
[1101.52 → 1105.50] Do you believe he is your Saviour, Messiah, Redeemer and friend?
[1105.50 → 1110.08] Do you desire to follow, to listen and love him all your days?
[1112.26 → 1116.64] That thing that's coming up in your mind right now, name it.
[1117.28 → 1124.34] That sin, that excuse, that regret, that anger, name it.
[1125.00 → 1127.26] He's calling you to confess it.
[1127.26 → 1134.20] Whether it's the first time or the hundredth time or what feels like the thousandth time,
[1134.86 → 1136.68] lay yourself bare before the Lord.
[1137.62 → 1142.74] He wants you to return because he loves you and has something better for you.
[1143.50 → 1146.32] And he wants you to share that with the world.
[1146.32 → 1151.60] If you don't know what to say to God, you can simply say,
[1152.42 → 1153.02] I'm sorry.
[1153.54 → 1155.62] I'm sorry for this thing I have done.
[1156.88 → 1159.90] Confess it today, right now.
[1159.90 → 1174.68] And then confess it tomorrow and the next day and every day.
[1174.68 → 1180.84] May your heart grow with the Thanksgiving for the sacrifice of Christ,
[1181.42 → 1185.62] that your confession becomes a joy to bring to the Lord
[1185.62 → 1191.38] because of the reminder of what he has done and find new life in him.
[1191.38 → 1196.68] You are worthy to rend happening when you are saved.

[1269.06 → 1271.06] Amen.

[1381.28 → 1386.70] The fall is wrapped, completely satisfied, Jesus, thank you.

[1407.88 → 1430.34] As we have opportunity this morning to come to baptism and profession of faith,
[1431.06 → 1436.16] I'd love for you to hear the words of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1436.16 → 1441.34] who said, all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[1442.24 → 1445.02] Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations,
[1445.22 → 1449.36] baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
[1449.76 → 1453.62] and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.
[1454.78 → 1459.28] And remember, I am with you always to the end of the age.
[1460.32 → 1462.72] Hear also these words from Holy Scripture.
[1462.72 → 1464.68] In the book of Romans, we read,
[1465.04 → 1469.38] all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death.
[1470.06 → 1474.12] We, therefore, are buried with him through baptism into death,
[1474.16 → 1479.88] in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father,
[1480.08 → 1482.92] we, too, may live a new life.
[1484.30 → 1490.00] Baptism is the sign and seal of God's promises to his covenant people.
[1490.00 → 1494.18] In baptism, God promises that by grace alone,
[1494.60 → 1495.74] your sins are forgiven,
[1496.36 → 1499.26] you are adopted into the body of Christ, the church,
[1499.74 → 1502.90] and that you are sent to the Holy Spirit daily
[1502.90 → 1505.66] to renew and to cleanse you,
[1506.16 → 1510.64] and that you are resurrected to eternal life.
[1510.64 → 1516.12] This promise is made visible for us in the waters of baptism.
[1517.02 → 1521.38] At this point, I'm going to invite Dave to come up to the front with Alvin as well.
[1521.46 → 1525.68] We're going to hear a little testimony from Dave and a word of encouragement from Alvin,
[1526.18 → 1527.78] and then we will proceed together.
[1527.78 → 1532.60] Dave and a word of encouragement from Alvin.
[1537.10 → 1537.50] Hello.
[1539.16 → 1542.52] Sorry, it's been a while since I've spoken in front of this many people,
[1542.68 → 1544.12] so bear with me.
[1545.90 → 1548.86] So, for those of you who do know me,
[1549.00 → 1549.84] I'm David Moore.
[1549.84 → 1553.32] I was born into a Christian family,
[1554.12 → 1556.28] was raised as a Christian,
[1556.42 → 1559.34] but I kind of fell away from my faith
[1559.34 → 1562.34] in my teen years.
[1562.72 → 1565.96] But I tried to come back and forth into it,
[1566.20 → 1568.40] just trying to find myself and find some answers
[1568.40 → 1570.34] for questions that I had throughout my life.
[1572.98 → 1575.04] But I never found those answers.
[1575.04 → 1579.18] As some of you may know,
[1579.28 → 1583.08] I lost my spouse to cancer two years ago,
[1583.52 → 1584.96] and during that time,
[1585.56 → 1589.42] my mom came and helped look after her,
[1589.60 → 1590.42] looked after my daughter,
[1590.96 → 1594.60] and I could hear them talking about God and Jesus
[1594.60 → 1596.04] and praying together.
[1597.42 → 1602.72] After that, I started working on building a village for my daughter
[1602.72 → 1604.74] because I knew she needed to be surrounded by great people.
[1605.04 → 1608.10] And some of those people were her friend, Ava,
[1608.38 → 1609.68] and her mom, Mackenzie,
[1609.86 → 1613.44] who spoke to her about God and Jesus.
[1614.16 → 1615.90] And so Emma all started asking me questions
[1615.90 → 1618.84] that I didn't have answers for,
[1618.98 → 1620.74] so I started speaking to people around me.
[1621.48 → 1626.80] And I didn't know where to go,
[1627.08 → 1629.56] but I was told that there was this great church
[1629.56 → 1630.42] that I should try out,
[1630.64 → 1631.68] so I came here.
[1631.68 → 1635.20] The first day I came here,
[1635.26 → 1636.64] I was just an observer.
[1636.86 → 1639.46] I just wanted to be here to support my daughter.
[1640.24 → 1641.66] And at the end of the service,
[1641.78 → 1644.54] when we were standing around having coffee,
[1644.94 → 1646.74] a woman approached me.
[1647.14 → 1650.46] And out of everyone in the church,
[1650.72 → 1652.14] she came up to me,
[1652.20 → 1653.06] and she's just like,
[1653.06 → 1654.56] hi, you're new here.
[1654.66 → 1655.48] I don't know you.
[1655.92 → 1657.04] And so we started chatting,
[1657.56 → 1661.80] and we got to knowing each other
[1661.80 → 1663.78] about our loss in our lives
[1663.78 → 1665.50] and got emotional.
[1665.72 → 1667.72] And so I stepped outside to try and collect myself,
[1667.88 → 1668.50] and she came up,
[1668.56 → 1668.98] and she's like,
[1669.22 → 1670.16] can I pray for you?
[1670.76 → 1671.38] And I'm just like,
[1671.50 → 1672.22] I'd love that.
[1672.58 → 1673.94] So she's like,
[1673.98 → 1674.68] can I ask your name?
[1674.74 → 1675.08] I'm like,
[1675.56 → 1676.16] I reached out my hand,
[1676.18 → 1676.40] I'm like,
[1676.44 → 1677.08] hi, I'm Dave.
[1677.84 → 1679.56] And to which she started crying,
[1679.76 → 1681.16] which immediately made me cry.
[1681.98 → 1682.76] And like,
[1682.92 → 1683.16] from,
[1684.36 → 1684.66] like,
[1685.24 → 1685.80] sorry.
[1689.80 → 1690.20] Like,
[1690.36 → 1692.20] what I can only describe as being overcome
[1692.20 → 1693.34] by the Holy Spirit,
[1694.00 → 1696.28] I cried for hours.
[1696.54 → 1697.32] I went home,
[1697.42 → 1698.10] and I didn't know what to do,
[1698.18 → 1699.08] and so the first thing I did
[1699.08 → 1701.28] was I pulled out my little pocket Bible
[1701.28 → 1701.82] that I had,
[1702.26 → 1703.12] and I just started reading.
[1704.42 → 1706.54] And so I started to think of this
[1706.54 → 1707.32] more wholeheartedly.
[1707.50 → 1708.84] I started talking to people in my life,
[1708.92 → 1709.62] trying to, like,
[1709.88 → 1710.46] get answers,
[1710.60 → 1712.56] and there's just too many things
[1712.56 → 1713.76] that I can,
[1714.88 → 1716.28] that I can't call coincidences.
[1716.56 → 1716.74] Like,
[1717.06 → 1718.72] to have a coincidence after coincidence
[1718.72 → 1719.36] after coincidence
[1719.36 → 1721.38] just keep on piling up.
[1721.78 → 1722.94] There's only one answer
[1722.94 → 1723.64] that I could come to.
[1724.64 → 1726.40] God was trying to grab me.
[1726.46 → 1727.76] He was trying to bring me
[1727.76 → 1729.06] into His embrace
[1729.06 → 1730.22] so that I could be
[1730.22 → 1731.90] with Him again.
[1733.14 → 1733.52] And so,
[1733.72 → 1734.40] I'm here today
[1734.40 → 1736.52] to tell you
[1736.52 → 1738.34] basically the start of my story
[1738.34 → 1739.76] and to walk with you
[1739.76 → 1740.44] for the rest of mine.
[1741.98 → 1742.50] Thank you.
[1742.50 → 1742.64] Amen.
[1743.48 → 1743.96] Applause
[1743.96 → 1757.94] Well, what an amazing day.
[1759.22 → 1760.32] This is the beginning,
[1760.84 → 1761.54] a new beginning
[1761.54 → 1763.36] of a lifelong journey in faith.
[1763.96 → 1764.44] Today,
[1764.60 → 1765.32] as you, Dave,
[1765.40 → 1766.16] and you, Mabel,
[1766.44 → 1767.30] are baptized,
[1767.86 → 1769.10] you're declaring your desire
[1769.10 → 1770.86] to embrace this new life,
[1771.02 → 1772.14] trusting wholeheartedly
[1772.14 → 1772.92] in Jesus Christ
[1772.92 → 1774.04] as your Lord and Saviour.
[1775.32 → 1775.80] Dave,
[1775.90 → 1776.98] I pray that you continue
[1776.98 → 1777.74] to read your Bible,
[1778.42 → 1779.40] ask more questions,
[1779.82 → 1780.92] challenge those around you
[1780.92 → 1781.58] to do the same,
[1782.04 → 1783.36] then search for those answers
[1783.36 → 1783.90] in Scripture.
[1784.70 → 1785.68] Lean into His Word,
[1785.82 → 1786.58] for it will guide you
[1786.58 → 1787.54] through every challenge,
[1787.92 → 1789.12] and show you the path.
[1789.86 → 1791.16] Your search for understanding
[1791.16 → 1792.70] will lead you closer to God,
[1793.18 → 1794.18] and through your faith,
[1794.34 → 1795.26] you will find the answers
[1795.26 → 1795.88] that you seek.
[1798.38 → 1798.78] Mabel,
[1799.64 → 1800.08] today,
[1800.26 → 1801.00] you're stepping
[1801.00 → 1801.94] into a new chapter
[1801.94 → 1802.62] of your life,
[1803.12 → 1804.32] one filled with the love
[1804.32 → 1805.22] and grace of God.
[1805.78 → 1806.48] As you grow,
[1806.76 → 1807.54] I encourage you
[1807.54 → 1808.50] to embrace the words
[1808.50 → 1809.52] of Psalm 119,
[1809.94 → 1810.86] where it says,
[1810.98 → 1811.58] Your Word,
[1811.74 → 1812.24] the Bible,
[1812.50 → 1813.82] is a lamp for my feet,
[1814.04 → 1815.40] a light unto my path.
[1816.10 → 1816.96] Allow God's Word
[1816.96 → 1817.76] to light your way,
[1818.10 → 1819.32] and you will find strength
[1819.32 → 1819.98] and guidance
[1819.98 → 1821.24] in every step that you take.
[1823.78 → 1824.22] Together,
[1824.42 → 1825.54] both of you in Christ,
[1825.80 → 1827.12] you have the support
[1827.12 → 1827.80] of your family
[1827.80 → 1828.50] and your friends.
[1828.94 → 1829.66] We are all here
[1829.66 → 1830.70] to walk alongside you,
[1831.16 → 1832.18] to encourage you,
[1832.24 → 1832.98] and to help you grow
[1832.98 → 1833.58] in your faith.
[1834.74 → 1836.06] Philippians 4.13 says,
[1836.18 → 1837.18] I can do all things
[1837.18 → 1837.62] through Him
[1837.62 → 1838.64] who gives me strength.
[1839.00 → 1839.72] Lean on Him
[1839.72 → 1840.98] in times of uncertainty,
[1841.36 → 1842.38] and He will provide you
[1842.38 → 1843.08] with the strength
[1843.08 → 1844.34] needed to navigate
[1844.34 → 1845.18] life's challenges.
[1845.18 → 1848.16] As you guys
[1848.16 → 1849.12] take this step today,
[1849.38 → 1850.52] know that you are not alone.
[1851.72 → 1852.64] God is with you
[1852.64 → 1853.56] every step of the way,
[1853.78 → 1854.26] and we,
[1854.46 → 1855.32] your community here,
[1855.38 → 1856.26] are here to support you.
[1856.64 → 1857.72] Embrace the new life
[1857.72 → 1858.26] you were beginning,
[1859.02 → 1859.68] filled with love,
[1859.82 → 1860.02] hope,
[1860.08 → 1861.10] and an amazing relationship
[1861.10 → 1861.94] with Jesus Christ.
[1862.70 → 1864.08] May God bless both of you
[1864.08 → 1864.62] abundantly
[1864.62 → 1865.96] as you grow in your faith
[1865.96 → 1867.36] and continue to ask
[1867.36 → 1868.16] those deep questions
[1868.16 → 1868.84] that will lead you
[1868.84 → 1869.56] closer to Him.
[1870.14 → 1870.54] Congratulations,
[1871.00 → 1871.84] and happy birthday.
[1871.84 → 1872.66] Thank you.
[1872.66 → 1875.32] It is His birthday today.
[1886.32 → 1887.46] Why don't you take a seat?
[1887.60 → 1887.88] Mabel,
[1888.02 → 1889.04] why don't you come up here?
[1890.84 → 1891.28] Dave,
[1891.34 → 1892.56] why don't you move over here?
[1894.22 → 1894.90] This way.
[1894.90 → 1897.90] So,
[1898.00 → 1900.44] as Alvin indicated,
[1901.44 → 1902.76] for the last year,
[1903.30 → 1905.76] Dave has been part of
[1905.76 → 1908.08] the Christianity Explored class
[1908.08 → 1908.82] that we run.
[1909.50 → 1911.18] He was part of our
[1911.18 → 1912.22] Heidelberg Catechism
[1912.22 → 1913.04] reading group,
[1913.58 → 1914.96] and part of many
[1914.96 → 1916.82] conversations and lunches,
[1916.92 → 1918.40] and introduced me to the best
[1918.40 → 1919.68] ramen place in town.
[1919.68 → 1923.38] But Dave asks questions.
[1924.24 → 1925.26] Lots of questions.
[1925.42 → 1927.00] Perfect questions,
[1927.36 → 1928.82] and I love that about you.
[1930.04 → 1930.98] But now it's my turn
[1930.98 → 1931.98] to ask you some questions.
[1933.56 → 1934.84] The questions I asked, Dave,
[1934.86 → 1935.20] they're going to be
[1935.20 → 1936.10] on the screen back there.
[1936.24 → 1937.12] They're also right here
[1937.12 → 1938.12] if you want to see them.
[1938.46 → 1939.90] You'll be invited to respond
[1939.90 → 1941.18] as we go through.
[1941.52 → 1941.80] All right?
[1941.80 → 1941.86] All right?
[1941.86 → 1948.16] Beloved of God,
[1948.80 → 1950.64] I ask you before God
[1950.64 → 1952.02] and Christ's church
[1952.02 → 1953.42] to reject evil,
[1953.78 → 1954.92] to profess your faith
[1954.92 → 1955.96] in Christ Jesus,
[1956.16 → 1957.52] and to confess the faith
[1957.52 → 1958.36] of this church
[1958.36 → 1959.10] through the ages.
[1959.76 → 1961.08] Do you renounce sin
[1961.08 → 1962.06] and the power of evil
[1962.06 → 1962.78] in your life
[1962.78 → 1963.40] and in the world?
[1964.30 → 1964.64] I do.
[1966.88 → 1969.06] Who is your Lord and Saviour?
[1971.00 → 1971.78] Jesus Christ.
[1971.86 → 1972.44] My Lord and Saviour.
[1973.02 → 1973.32] Amen.
[1974.28 → 1974.98] And will you be
[1974.98 → 1975.88] a faithful member
[1975.88 → 1976.88] of this congregation
[1976.88 → 1977.78] and through worship
[1977.78 → 1978.72] and service seek
[1978.72 → 1980.44] to advance God's kingdom
[1980.44 → 1981.64] here and throughout
[1981.64 → 1982.16] the world?
[1982.70 → 1983.68] I will with God's help.
[1984.50 → 1985.70] And do you promise
[1985.70 → 1986.98] to accept the spiritual
[1986.98 → 1988.36] guidance of this church,
[1988.60 → 1990.62] to walk in the spirit
[1990.62 → 1991.54] of Christian love
[1991.54 → 1992.36] with this congregation,
[1992.36 → 1994.26] and to seek those things
[1994.26 → 1995.32] that make for unity,
[1995.70 → 1996.96] purity, and peace?
[1997.44 → 1998.58] I do with God's help.
[1999.10 → 1999.40] Amen.
[1999.40 → 1999.50] Amen.
[2000.96 → 2001.82] Since baptism
[2001.82 → 2003.48] is the gift of God
[2003.48 → 2005.02] for the church of God,
[2005.28 → 2006.72] we are never alone
[2006.72 → 2008.42] in professing our faith.
[2008.94 → 2010.22] So I'm going to ask everyone
[2010.22 → 2012.00] if you would stand together
[2012.00 → 2015.18] and answer the following questions
[2015.18 → 2016.00] with Dave,
[2016.48 → 2017.42] which will be,
[2017.68 → 2019.30] the responses will be words
[2019.30 → 2020.60] from the Apostles' Creed,
[2021.08 → 2022.62] a confession of the Christian church
[2022.62 → 2024.04] for almost 2,000 years.
[2024.04 → 2026.46] And so altogether,
[2026.68 → 2028.20] do you believe in God the Father?
[2029.12 → 2031.10] I believe in God the Father,
[2031.22 → 2031.68] Almighty,
[2032.22 → 2033.96] creator of heaven and earth.
[2034.54 → 2036.60] Do you believe in Jesus Christ?
[2037.38 → 2039.46] I believe in Jesus Christ,
[2039.72 → 2041.50] his only Son, our Lord,
[2041.98 → 2042.94] who was conceived
[2042.94 → 2044.20] by the Holy Spirit
[2044.20 → 2046.28] and born of the Virgin Mary.
[2046.90 → 2048.96] He suffered under Pontius Pilate,
[2049.28 → 2050.14] was crucified,
[2050.58 → 2050.96] died,
[2051.06 → 2051.84] and was buried.
[2051.84 → 2053.60] He descended to hell.
[2054.38 → 2055.26] The third day,
[2055.40 → 2057.12] he rose again from the dead.
[2057.78 → 2058.94] He ascended to heaven
[2058.94 → 2060.12] and is seated
[2060.12 → 2061.76] at the right hand of God,
[2061.84 → 2062.90] the Father Almighty.
[2063.60 → 2064.20] From there,
[2064.30 → 2065.56] he will come to judge
[2065.56 → 2066.88] the living and the dead.
[2067.98 → 2069.64] And do you believe in God,
[2069.72 → 2070.52] the Holy Spirit?
[2071.40 → 2073.48] I believe in the Holy Spirit,
[2074.02 → 2075.62] the Holy Catholic Church,
[2075.62 → 2077.56] the communion of saints,
[2078.10 → 2079.56] the forgiveness of sins,
[2080.14 → 2081.74] the resurrection of the body,
[2082.24 → 2083.66] and the life everlasting.
[2084.46 → 2084.84] Amen.
[2085.84 → 2086.12] Amen.
[2087.12 → 2087.60] Dave,
[2087.84 → 2088.82] I'm going to invite you
[2088.82 → 2090.08] to squeeze yourself
[2090.08 → 2091.82] into this pool here.
[2092.60 → 2092.92] Emma Bell,
[2092.98 → 2093.72] why don't you come stand
[2093.72 → 2094.44] on this side?
[2097.44 → 2098.86] Thank you for holding it up.
[2101.74 → 2102.88] Go ahead and have a seat.
[2102.88 → 2102.94] Thank you.
[2105.62 → 2108.50] I think you need more water.
[2108.80 → 2109.92] No, sit up, sit up.
[2113.96 → 2116.56] David John Moore,
[2117.12 → 2118.12] I baptize you
[2118.12 → 2119.02] in the name of the Father
[2119.02 → 2120.24] and of the Son
[2120.24 → 2121.80] and of the Holy Spirit.
[2122.20 → 2122.44] Amen.
[2122.44 → 2122.62] Amen.
[2128.62 → 2129.54] Amen.
[2130.16 → 2131.32] Amen.
[2131.32 → 2131.40] Amen.
[2131.40 → 2131.44] Amen.
[2131.44 → 2131.52] Amen.
[2135.62 → 2136.02] Amen.
[2152.02 → 2153.90] We were ready.
[2156.64 → 2157.04] Yep.
[2158.06 → 2158.96] Thanks, my wife,
[2159.00 → 2159.46] for bringing them.
[2159.52 → 2160.26] I forgot them at home.
[2160.26 → 2160.32] Amen.
[2160.32 → 2160.38] Amen.
[2160.38 → 2160.44] Amen.
[2160.44 → 2160.72] Amen.
[2160.72 → 2161.24] Amen.
[2161.24 → 2161.34] Amen.
[2161.34 → 2161.36] Amen.
[2161.36 → 2161.44] Amen.
[2161.44 → 2161.48] Amen.
[2161.48 → 2161.88] Amen.
[2161.88 → 2161.96] Amen.
[2161.96 → 2162.64] Amen.
[2162.64 → 2163.96] Amen.
[2163.96 → 2164.48] Amen.
[2164.48 → 2165.54] Amen.
[2165.54 → 2166.34] Amen.
[2166.34 → 2171.34] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[2171.52 → 2173.68] the only king and head of the church,
[2174.18 → 2177.54] Dave is now received into the membership
[2177.54 → 2179.66] of the Holy Catholic Church,
[2179.80 → 2181.96] engaged to confess Christ
[2181.96 → 2183.62] and to be God's faithful servant
[2183.62 → 2185.38] until life's end.
[2185.68 → 2185.90] Amen?
[2186.36 → 2186.92] Amen.
[2187.28 → 2187.54] Amen.
[2188.76 → 2189.44] Emma Bell,
[2189.50 → 2190.88] why don't you stand over here
[2190.88 → 2191.90] beside Dad for a moment?
[2191.90 → 2191.96] Amen.
[2191.96 → 2199.94] In Acts 2, in the founding of the Christian church at Pentecost, Peter says that the promise of
[2199.94 → 2206.70] forgiveness and the Holy Spirit is for you and for your children, for all who are far off,
[2206.74 → 2212.52] for all whom the Lord our God will call. And in 1 Corinthians 7, the apostle writes that the
[2212.52 → 2217.56] children of believing parents are holy, that is, they are set apart for God's covenant.
[2217.56 → 2224.84] Because we believe that God's covenant grace extends from parent to child, we are also baptizing
[2224.84 → 2230.32] Emma Bell this morning. And for that, Dave, I have two more questions for you. I invite you to respond
[2230.32 → 2236.14] at the end of my reading both questions, which I do with God's help. Dave, do you believe that your
[2236.14 → 2241.98] child, though sinful by nature, is received by God in Christ as a member of his covenant and therefore
[2241.98 → 2247.18] ought to be baptized? And do you promise in reliance on the Holy Spirit and with the help of the
[2247.18 → 2252.52] Christian community to do all in your power to instruct her in the Christian faith, to lead
[2252.52 → 2259.18] her by your example into Christian discipleship? Dave, what is your answer? Amen. Emma Bell,
[2259.28 → 2267.84] can you step forward just a little bit for me? Thank you. Emma Bell Isla Eaton Moore,
[2267.84 → 2278.28] amen. Amen. Amen.
[2278.28 → 2278.40] Amen.
[2284.98 → 2288.90] You guys want to just go take a seat there for a second? I'll invite you back up.
[2288.90 → 2312.12] Take your spot here.
[2312.12 → 2328.14] Mackenzie, this first part is for you. It's our hope and prayer that here your faith in God will
[2328.14 → 2334.46] be strengthened, that your love for Jesus will be grown, and that you will find opportunity to serve
[2334.46 → 2341.98] in the Spirit as you join us on mission with God to the community. As we welcome you into this
[2341.98 → 2347.46] church family, we ask that you affirm the faith that you have professed and been baptized into,
[2347.60 → 2352.82] and your commitment to God's mission in and through Langley-Emmanuel, to the city, to the region,
[2352.82 → 2357.92] and through us all to the world. To do so, I'm going to ask you three questions. I'll invite you to
[2357.92 → 2364.76] respond at the end of all three questions. Mackenzie, do you believe in Jesus as your Saviour and Lord,
[2365.12 → 2371.38] and that in him only is hope and freedom from sin found? Do you believe that the Bible is the word of God
[2371.38 → 2376.68] revealing his plan for redemption in Christ Jesus, and that the preaching and teaching of this church
[2376.68 → 2382.24] reflect this truth? And do you promise, with the help of the Holy Spirit, to do all you can to
[2382.24 → 2388.32] strengthen your relationship to Jesus by being part of the life of this church, recognizing its oversight
[2388.32 → 2394.88] and authority, and joining with us on mission for Jesus in this community, in this city, and the world?
[2395.42 → 2396.84] Mackenzie, what is your answer?
[2396.84 → 2398.06] Thank you. That's God's help.
[2398.34 → 2404.66] Amen. And again, we believe that God's covenant grace extends from parent to child, and so this
[2404.66 → 2409.88] morning, we're also going to baptize Ava, and for that, Mackenzie, I ask two more questions.
[2410.70 → 2416.06] Do you believe that your child, though sinful by nature, is received by God in Christ as a member
[2416.06 → 2422.08] of his covenant, and therefore ought to be baptized? And do you promise in reliance on the Holy Spirit,
[2422.08 → 2426.96] and with the help of the Christian community, to do all in your power, to instruct her in the Christian
[2426.96 → 2432.66] faith, and to lead her, by your example, into Christian discipleship? Mackenzie, what is your answer?
[2433.80 → 2437.84] Amen. Ava, I'm going to invite you to get into the pool.
[2437.84 → 2451.84] I don't think you'll displace as much water as Dave did. Mackenzie, why don't you come to the
[2451.84 → 2458.22] back here, and you can take her shoulders as she goes back. No, I said to the back.
[2458.22 → 2469.88] Okay. All right, you're going to plug your nose? All right. Ava, Christina, Elena, Halal,
[2470.34 → 2474.92] I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[2479.92 → 2486.28] Amen. Amen. Good job, sweetheart. Can you pass me the towel down?
[2486.28 → 2502.32] Amen. Nothing quite like a cold plunge to wake you up in the morning, right? And almost falling
[2502.32 → 2508.46] up. Why don't you guys stay up here? Ava, stay up here. Dave and Mabel, why don't you
[2508.46 → 2524.34] guys come back up here as well? Church family, now it is your turn. I invite you to stand as you are
[2524.34 → 2536.56] able. Do you, family of God gathered here, promise to love, encourage, and support Dave and Mabel
[2536.56 → 2543.72] and Mackenzie and Ava by welcoming them into our church family, by teaching the gospel of God's love,
[2543.86 → 2550.28] by being an example of Christian faith and character, and by giving the strong support of God's family in
[2550.28 → 2558.76] fellowship, in prayer, and in service? What is your answer? We do, for God's help. Amen. You may be seated.
[2561.66 → 2565.90] I'm going to invite you guys to come over here to the front, down below.
[2565.90 → 2578.68] At this point, I'd like to invite some elders to come forward. They're going to give you a gift and a
[2578.68 → 2585.96] little memento of this occasion and welcome you. Following that, we're going to offer a prayer and
[2585.96 → 2589.34] laying hands on of you as well.
[2607.98 → 2613.40] Standing together as representatives of the family of Christ and as members of this church,
[2613.40 → 2620.20] the Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you. The
[2620.20 → 2628.44] Lord turn his face toward you and give you his peace. In this way, the Lord has put his name on you
[2628.44 → 2636.72] and marked you as his own. I want to invite all of those who know Dave and Mackenzie, who want to
[2636.72 → 2641.16] encourage them at this moment of life and faith to come forward. We're going to lay hands on them.
[2641.16 → 2647.76] Officers, service members, elders, deacons in this church, if you've walked in any way with these
[2647.76 → 2652.08] folks, we invite you to come up to the front. We might lay hands on together. Dave and Mackenzie,
[2652.16 → 2654.34] I encourage you just to step forward so we can surround you.
[2668.68 → 2669.56] Let's pray together.
[2669.56 → 2669.58] Let's pray together.
[2671.16 → 2680.10] Father in heaven, for Jesus' sake and for your glory, we pray, stir up in Dave and
[2680.10 → 2688.14] Mabel and in Mackenzie and Ava the gift of your Holy Spirit. Confirm their faith, guide their life,
[2688.56 → 2695.40] empower their serving, give them patience in suffering, and bring them to everlasting life
[2695.40 → 2703.34] through Jesus Christ our Lord. Together with them, we all walk in faith in Jesus' precious name.
[2703.34 → 2707.72] All God's people said, Amen. Amen.
[2707.72 → 2718.48] We're going to stand and sing together in gratitude to God, the song, Gratitude.
[2718.48 → 2718.92] Amen.
[2748.48 → 2762.16] Oh, my words fall short, I've got nothing new
[2762.16 → 2769.10] Look at how I express all my gratitude
[2769.10 → 2779.10] She makes songs, as I often do
[2779.10 → 2787.10] But it's not my standard, and you never do
[2787.10 → 2795.10] So I draw up my hands, pray to you again and again
[2795.10 → 2805.10] All that I have is now, hallelujah, hallelujah
[2805.10 → 2813.10] I know it's not much, I know nothing else in for a king
[2813.10 → 2825.10] Step for a heart singing, hallelujah, hallelujah
[2825.10 → 2835.10] I've got one response, I've got just one move
[2835.10 → 2844.10] With my arms stretched wide, I will worship you
[2844.10 → 2852.10] So I draw up my hands, pray to you again and again
[2852.10 → 2862.10] Because all that I have is now, hallelujah, hallelujah
[2862.10 → 2870.10] And I know it's not much, but nobody else in for a king
[2870.10 → 2884.10] Step for a heart singing, hallelujah, hallelujah
[2884.10 → 2890.10] Come on, my soul, don't you dare shy on me
[2890.10 → 2892.10] Let up your song
[2892.10 → 2896.10] Because you've got a lion inside those lungs
[2896.10 → 2902.10] Get up and praise the Lord
[2902.10 → 2907.10] Come on, my soul, don't you dare shy on me
[2907.10 → 2909.10] Let up your song
[2909.10 → 2913.10] Because you've got a lion inside those lungs
[2913.10 → 2919.10] Get up and praise the Lord
[2919.10 → 2924.10] Come on, my soul, don't you dare shy on me
[2924.10 → 2926.10] Let up your song
[2926.10 → 2930.10] Because you've got a lion inside those lungs
[2930.10 → 2936.10] Get up and praise the Lord
[2936.10 → 2938.10] Lord, I'm going to throw up my hands
[2938.10 → 2942.10] Praise you again and again
[2942.10 → 2952.10] Cause all that I have is now, hallelujah, hallelujah
[2952.10 → 2958.10] And I know it's not much, but nothing else in for a king
[2958.10 → 2974.10] Set for our singing, hallelujah, hallelujah
[2974.10 → 2976.10] Amen
[2976.10 → 2978.10] Amen
[2978.10 → 2979.10] Amen
[2979.10 → 2981.10] Amen
[2981.10 → 2983.10] Amen
[2983.10 → 2985.10] Amen
[2985.10 → 2987.10] Amen
[2987.10 → 2990.10] Amen
[2994.10 → 2997.10] So, good morning
[2997.10 → 3000.10] We continue our worship by having an offering
[3000.10 → 3003.10] So our offering today is for the budget
[3003.10 → 3006.10] As well as for Open Doors Canada
[3006.10 → 3009.10] And they're both offerings are collected in the same bag
[3009.10 → 3013.10] So if you wish to give to the budget then please mark it as such
[3013.10 → 3018.34] and you can use the envelopes that are in front of you, in the chairs in front of you.
[3019.34 → 3027.20] So Open Doors Canada is a ministry that works with the persecuted church around the world,
[3027.60 → 3034.06] and it was founded in 1955 by Brother Andrew, who famously wrote that book, God's Smuggler,
[3034.06 → 3044.86] and since that founding of that organization is now an organization that's gone through about 70 different countries in the world,
[3045.46 → 3052.86] and some of the persecuted countries are in North Korea, in Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Myanmar.
[3053.20 → 3059.86] Myanmar is now, again, on the list since there is a coup that's going on there, and there's a great persecution going on in Myanmar.
[3059.86 → 3068.86] What Open Doors does for support is they supply Bibles and other resources, as well as they train leaders,
[3069.56 → 3071.72] they strengthen the leaders of these persecuted churches.
[3072.42 → 3080.20] They also supply aid for anybody who's been a victim of persecution, and then they also have a prayer watch.
[3080.64 → 3085.54] So if you go to their website, you will find that every day there is a new prayer request.
[3085.54 → 3094.74] And so, like, for today, the prayer request is for a country in Middle Asia where the church, when they were meeting,
[3094.88 → 3103.48] they were surrounded by the militia and were kidnapped for two days and went without food or water for two solid days.
[3103.62 → 3109.54] They've been since released, but you can imagine the trauma that that has ensued.
[3110.44 → 3114.04] That church now would be afraid to meet, they'd be afraid that it would happen again.
[3114.04 → 3116.50] And so the whole church is just persecuted.
[3117.14 → 3121.08] So today's prayer request, then, is to actually pray for strength for that church,
[3121.44 → 3128.54] that they can be surrounded by the power of the Spirit and to continue to meet.
[3129.26 → 3137.80] So maybe this week would be a nice challenge for us to go to that website and at least once pray the prayer request that's there.
[3137.80 → 3145.06] Brother Andrew has famously said that prayer is not the preparation for battle, prayer is the battle.
[3145.66 → 3148.34] So please give generously and thank you.
[3148.34 → 3153.86] Thank you.
[3153.86 → 3157.18] Do you like to leave the sermon.
[3157.18 → 3163.60] Hope Hal and on
[3164.48 → 3165.98] Not everyone alone on the Internet.
[3165.98 → 3168.28] drowning Anchor
[3168.28 → 3190.50] I will offer up my life in spirit and truth, pouring out the oil of love as my worship to Him.
[3190.50 → 3202.54] In surrender I must live, I have required, Lord receives the sacrifice of a broken heart.
[3202.54 → 3214.08] Jesus, what can I give, what can I bring to so faithful of wrath, to so loving and pain?
[3214.08 → 3225.66] Saviour, what can be said, what can be sung as a praise of Your name for the things You have done?
[3225.66 → 3241.66] Oh, my words, there's no doubt, not even in part of the dead of love that is owed by this thankful heart.
[3244.08 → 3257.48] You deserve my every path, for You paid the great cost, giving up Your life to death, even death on a cross.
[3257.48 → 3268.90] You took all my shame away, there defeated my sin, open up the gates of hell and let beckon me in.
[3268.90 → 3280.32] Jesus, what can I give, what can I bring to so faithful of wrath, to so loving and pain?
[3280.72 → 3291.46] Saviour, what can be said, what can be sung as a praise of Your name for the things You have done?
[3291.46 → 3303.46] Oh, my words, there's no doubt, not even in part of the dead of love that is owed.
[3303.46 → 3312.46] Of the dead of love that is owed by this thankful heart.
[3312.46 → 3331.14] I would love any kids in preschool through kindergarten or thereabouts.
[3331.36 → 3332.54] I'll let your parents decide.
[3332.54 → 3333.82] Come on up to the front.
[3334.36 → 3336.64] We're going to do the children's blessing here.
[3337.94 → 3338.70] Right up.
[3338.80 → 3339.30] Beautiful.
[3340.78 → 3341.72] Excellent job.
[3342.46 → 3343.88] Oh, some more.
[3344.08 → 3344.62] Love it.
[3345.40 → 3346.38] Ava, perfect.
[3348.80 → 3349.52] All right.
[3350.26 → 3351.26] Here we go.
[3352.48 → 3353.30] Well, excellent.
[3353.40 → 3353.72] Any more?
[3353.80 → 3354.24] Anyone else?
[3355.00 → 3355.60] Last chance?
[3356.18 → 3356.82] Going once?
[3357.38 → 3357.62] No?
[3357.74 → 3358.00] All right.
[3358.42 → 3359.26] All right, guys.
[3359.26 → 3362.32] You guys are going to head off to children's worship time together.
[3363.00 → 3369.32] And if you don't go back there with the leaders, I encourage you to go back to your seats and hang out with us for the next little bit.
[3369.32 → 3371.74] But before that, we're going to bless the congregation.
[3371.74 → 3373.36] And they're going to bless us.
[3373.36 → 3373.80] Right?
[3373.80 → 3376.22] So if you know how that works, why don't you lead the way?
[3376.38 → 3377.74] Stand up together.
[3378.64 → 3380.32] Everybody can stand up together.
[3380.32 → 3383.20] And then we're going to say, the Lord be with you.
[3383.20 → 3385.70] And the church will respond by saying, and...
[3385.70 → 3391.70] My name is...
[3391.70 → 3392.62] Whoa.
[3392.92 → 3393.40] That's loud.
[3394.40 → 3396.92] My name is Paul, and I'm an elder here.
[3397.16 → 3401.30] And it's my privilege to pray with you.
[3404.30 → 3405.66] Our church family prayer.
[3406.04 → 3406.58] Let's pray.
[3406.58 → 3417.92] Father in heaven, you are holy.
[3418.92 → 3419.86] You are mighty.
[3421.44 → 3424.88] You are worthy and worthy of praise.
[3424.88 → 3434.18] You are the Lord of Lords, the King of Kings, the Prince of Peace, who is the Lamb of God.
[3434.84 → 3437.00] You are the living God.
[3438.40 → 3440.22] You will reign forever.
[3441.46 → 3446.20] You're the Ancient of Days, the Alpha, the Omega, the Beginning, and the End.
[3446.72 → 3448.50] Our Saviour, Redeemer.
[3448.50 → 3453.12] And yet, you are our friend.
[3454.62 → 3456.96] It seems so implausible.
[3458.58 → 3459.44] Thank you.
[3460.66 → 3464.68] Thank you for being with us, walking beside us through life.
[3466.30 → 3471.04] You take all of us, everything that we are, and make us whole.
[3473.36 → 3476.78] Lord, we're incapable of changing ourselves.
[3476.78 → 3487.44] But by your Spirit, work in us to make us like your Son, as hard and as painful as that might be sometimes.
[3488.76 → 3495.94] And give us joy in it, for we know that true joy comes only from you.
[3498.64 → 3501.94] We've all come with individual and personal needs.
[3503.04 → 3505.80] Needs that we may not have shared with anyone else.
[3506.78 → 3510.42] But you know us, and the struggles and the burdens we're facing.
[3512.80 → 3515.76] We thank you for the blessing of new beginnings.
[3517.54 → 3524.76] Today we lift Dave, Annabelle, Mackenzie, and Ava as they step forward in faith.
[3524.76 → 3539.54] May your Spirit fill their hearts and peace and strength with strength and purpose.
[3541.00 → 3545.26] Guide them as they all grow in faith along with us,
[3545.40 → 3549.44] and help us to support them with love, grace, and fellowship.
[3549.44 → 3555.20] We praise you, God, for the blessings of anniversaries.
[3556.02 → 3562.20] And we thank you, along with Pete and Doreen, that you have blessed them for 45 years together.
[3563.44 → 3566.30] We ask that you will continue to bless and keep them.
[3566.30 → 3572.38] We also pray for those marriages and relationships that struggle.
[3574.16 → 3578.68] We pray for peace and grace in those relationships.
[3578.68 → 3587.22] We also pray for Clem and Linda and Adrian and Sarah as they grieve the loss of Clem's mom, Annie.
[3589.42 → 3595.92] Annie suffered for many years, and there is relief for Annie, but the whole family misses her greatly.
[3595.92 → 3607.28] We continue to pray for peace and comfort for Tanya, Amanda's sister and Klaus' daughter, as she is now in hospice care.
[3608.98 → 3611.22] Lord, we pray for peace and strength for her.
[3611.40 → 3617.46] We also pray that Tanya can continue to trust in God's perfect plan and rest in his love.
[3617.46 → 3623.76] We also pray for Doug, Alisa's dad, as he continues to battle cancer.
[3626.34 → 3632.40] During this summer, we thank God for the gift of rest and adventure and time with family.
[3633.04 → 3636.66] We pray for safe travels and refreshing holidays.
[3639.84 → 3644.72] We pray you will bless the ongoing ministries here in this church, Langley, Emmanuel.
[3644.72 → 3656.16] We thank you for the gift of his family, of this family, and we ask that you will help us continue to grow in the love that only comes from you.
[3656.92 → 3660.24] We pray that you will continue to walk beside our pastors.
[3661.50 → 3664.42] Give them the wisdom and the spirit to lead us.
[3666.98 → 3673.30] We thank you together with Pastor Kevin that you have led him to this point in his life of becoming fully ordained.
[3674.72 → 3682.02] Father, we give you thanks for bringing us together as this community we call Emmanuel, God with us.
[3682.58 → 3685.66] We pray that you will bless us in our worship and bless our fellowship.
[3687.84 → 3690.06] We give you thanks for this place to meet.
[3690.66 → 3698.20] We thank you, O God, for Christ's church as we know it and see it around the world and pray for your blessings on it.
[3698.20 → 3702.28] We pray for those who are persecuted for your name.
[3703.80 → 3708.84] And we ask that you will be with Chris as he leads us in your word this morning.
[3709.48 → 3711.26] Pray that it will fill our hearts.
[3713.22 → 3718.86] And we pray that you will pour out your spirit on him as he preaches that word here today.
[3718.86 → 3725.82] Lord Almighty, the Lord Almighty is with us.
[3726.72 → 3728.98] The God of Jacob is our fortress.
[3730.02 → 3732.76] Come and see what the Lord has done.
[3734.00 → 3736.22] The desolations he has brought on the earth.
[3736.90 → 3739.84] He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth.
[3740.74 → 3744.08] He breaks the bow and shatters the spear.
[3744.08 → 3747.24] He burns the shields with fire.
[3748.44 → 3752.22] He says, be still and know that I am God.
[3753.36 → 3755.72] I will be exalted among the nations.
[3756.10 → 3758.32] I will be exalted in the earth.
[3759.54 → 3761.94] The Lord Almighty is with us.
[3762.18 → 3765.06] The God of Jacob is our fortress.
[3766.34 → 3769.36] All glory be to Christ our King.
[3770.36 → 3772.98] All glory be to Christ.
[3774.08 → 3776.78] In his name alone we pray.
[3777.38 → 3777.72] Amen.
[3777.72 → 3777.84] Amen.
[3793.04 → 3798.80] We're going to spend a little time together looking at the Gospel of Matthew this summer.
[3799.04 → 3802.48] We are in a series here going through the Gospel of Matthew.
[3802.48 → 3805.48] So I'm going to invite you, if you have a Bible, to open it up.
[3805.56 → 3809.32] We're going to read from Matthew 9, verse 35 to 38.
[3809.38 → 3814.66] But we're really kind of reflecting on Matthew 8 through the end of Matthew 10.
[3815.02 → 3819.50] And so it will be really helpful if you have a Bible in front of you and open, whether it's
[3819.50 → 3822.98] on a device or if you'd like to grab one from the back, you can do that.
[3823.00 → 3824.44] Or if you brought your own, excellent.
[3825.68 → 3828.38] But we're going to spend our time there.
[3828.38 → 3835.22] If you are a guest with us this morning, our summer series has been Behold Your King.
[3835.92 → 3840.84] And we've called it that because we don't just want to learn about Jesus.
[3841.38 → 3842.70] We want to see him.
[3843.62 → 3844.88] To encounter him.
[3845.60 → 3853.20] To see the Holy Spirit take the word from our minds to our hearts and then outlived by our hands.
[3853.20 → 3858.14] To not just be informed, but transformed is one of the ways we've put it.
[3859.10 → 3868.86] To behold and to worship, to set your heart's affections on Jesus so that you live with him and for him every day.
[3869.92 → 3878.94] It's our conviction here that God's word is more than a story about the past, but actually through it, this is Jesus stepping into your present.
[3878.94 → 3886.36] This is God entering into your imagination, shaping how you see the world.
[3887.64 → 3898.54] This is the Holy Spirit inviting you this morning to let go of your little kingdom and to receive joy and security and freedom in Jesus' kingdom.
[3898.54 → 3909.88] In the preaching of God's word, we believe that God himself draws near through his voice and that it's made effective by the Holy Spirit in your hearts.
[3910.30 → 3917.14] So I invite you to pray that this morning as we begin and as we read from Matthew 9 together.
[3918.48 → 3921.68] Matthew 9, starting at verse 35.
[3921.68 → 3935.60] Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness.
[3936.56 → 3945.42] When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
[3945.42 → 3953.56] And then he said to his disciples, the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.
[3954.62 → 3960.96] Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.
[3961.62 → 3962.84] This is the word of the Lord.
[3962.84 → 3977.26] I don't know if you've noticed this, but we live in a world that is deeply suspicious of authority.
[3979.00 → 3984.08] Some of us feel like we've inherited a culture of suspicion.
[3985.82 → 3990.56] And, if we're honest, some of us have contributed to it.
[3992.84 → 4003.38] Because we don't trust an authority out there, the highest good in our world today is to be true to yourself in here.
[4004.56 → 4007.66] And to live from the inside out.
[4008.88 → 4015.26] Knowingly or not, we have internalized the slogans of the French Revolution that say,
[4015.38 → 4016.58] No gods and no masters.
[4016.58 → 4022.16] We've made a modern gospel of self-actualization.
[4022.64 → 4023.90] Things like, you do you.
[4024.44 → 4025.30] Live your truth.
[4025.44 → 4028.54] Don't let anyone tell you who to be or how to be.
[4028.70 → 4032.80] And we breathe in this message and messaging every day.
[4032.80 → 4041.58] And the result is that the only real authority left is personal preference.
[4043.90 → 4050.82] The only real authority left is the idea that if it feels good, it's valid.
[4052.18 → 4055.66] And that if it offends me, it must be oppressive.
[4055.66 → 4062.04] Now, Charles Taylor is a social psychologist, social philosopher.
[4062.64 → 4065.54] He calls this the age of authenticity.
[4066.58 → 4071.52] A time when authority is no longer something outside of us to obey,
[4071.92 → 4074.56] but something inside of us to express.
[4075.94 → 4079.52] And in that world, the idea of behold your king,
[4079.52 → 4084.88] the idea of Jesus as king, doesn't feel like good news to many people.
[4084.88 → 4086.42] It feels like a threat.
[4088.22 → 4090.68] The modern self doesn't want a king.
[4090.94 → 4092.40] The modern self wants a mirror.
[4093.64 → 4095.34] The modern self wants a platform.
[4098.02 → 4101.56] And yet, I know I felt it.
[4103.14 → 4109.18] And if we're honest, this self-made freedom hasn't delivered what it promised.
[4109.18 → 4110.08] Right?
[4110.08 → 4114.08] We are more expressive than ever before,
[4114.28 → 4117.74] but also more anxious and more isolated and more exhausted.
[4118.82 → 4119.36] Right?
[4119.40 → 4121.90] We're told to cast off all these old masters,
[4122.18 → 4123.76] but we still don't feel free.
[4124.86 → 4125.40] Right?
[4125.46 → 4130.64] Our age has rejected God in favour of so-called personal health
[4130.64 → 4132.24] and individual autonomy.
[4132.24 → 4136.48] And not only have we lost God and never found personal health,
[4136.66 → 4140.12] this individual autonomy that we've been looking for has only led to loneliness.
[4142.76 → 4145.64] To paraphrase something I read earlier,
[4146.14 → 4147.38] you've heard the phrase,
[4147.58 → 4149.40] don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.
[4150.28 → 4151.88] In this cultural moment,
[4151.88 → 4156.22] it sort of seems like we've thrown out the baby in order to drink the bathwater.
[4156.22 → 4162.30] One writer says that our standard of living has risen,
[4163.06 → 4164.56] but so have our suicide rates.
[4165.74 → 4168.02] We are smarter, but more uncertain than ever.
[4168.64 → 4170.86] We are surrounded by pleasure, but less fulfilled.
[4171.54 → 4173.54] Able to do almost anything,
[4173.68 → 4177.14] but uncertain whether to do anything at all.
[4178.86 → 4182.32] Jonathan Haidt is a social psychologist,
[4182.32 → 4186.66] and coincidentally also not a Christian,
[4187.18 → 4188.14] but in his book,
[4188.26 → 4189.42] The Anxious Generation,
[4190.06 → 4190.96] puts it this way.
[4191.04 → 4191.50] He says,
[4192.44 → 4195.24] the great irony of things like social media
[4195.24 → 4198.18] is that the more you immerse yourself in it,
[4198.64 → 4200.88] the more lonely and depressed you become.
[4203.36 → 4203.56] Right?
[4203.60 → 4204.76] Without ever knowing it,
[4205.26 → 4206.92] we ache for something.
[4207.64 → 4209.30] We ache for someone,
[4209.60 → 4211.40] for something greater than ourselves.
[4211.40 → 4213.44] Something strong enough,
[4213.52 → 4214.98] or someone strong enough,
[4215.08 → 4217.38] to calm the storms of our anxiety.
[4218.00 → 4221.40] Compassionate enough to move towards us in our pain.
[4222.18 → 4224.00] Wise enough to lead us.
[4224.32 → 4226.98] We ache for a king who doesn't crush us,
[4227.06 → 4228.62] but instead carries us.
[4229.18 → 4231.68] Who doesn't collapse our perception of reality
[4231.68 → 4233.76] into a sort of flat equality,
[4234.10 → 4235.70] but actually deepens it,
[4235.82 → 4238.80] and commissions us to go out into it,
[4238.88 → 4240.36] with him and for him,
[4240.36 → 4242.66] exploring the mystery of life,
[4243.02 → 4243.50] and faith,
[4243.82 → 4244.36] and God.
[4245.50 → 4248.14] And that's exactly the kind of king
[4248.14 → 4251.12] that Matthew wants us to see
[4251.12 → 4252.30] in his gospel.
[4252.40 → 4254.88] The kind of king that Jesus is.
[4256.16 → 4256.62] Right?
[4256.70 → 4258.14] The big idea here this morning
[4258.14 → 4261.10] is that Jesus' authority over disease,
[4261.36 → 4262.14] and demons,
[4262.38 → 4263.02] and death,
[4263.02 → 4264.72] confirms his mission,
[4264.88 → 4266.70] confirms who he is,
[4266.90 → 4268.14] and in doing so,
[4268.24 → 4270.42] calls us to follow him.
[4272.44 → 4273.74] If you want to know
[4273.74 → 4276.06] what kind of king Jesus is,
[4276.48 → 4277.94] Matthew shows us.
[4278.80 → 4280.76] Not by telling you his ideas,
[4281.16 → 4283.44] but by putting his power on full display.
[4284.70 → 4284.84] Right?
[4284.84 → 4286.96] This is not a king who rules from a distance.
[4287.08 → 4288.36] He walks among his people.
[4288.36 → 4290.02] He touches the sick.
[4290.16 → 4291.38] He speaks to storms.
[4291.52 → 4292.98] He rebukes demons,
[4293.18 → 4294.02] forgives sins,
[4294.16 → 4295.12] and raises the dead.
[4295.46 → 4296.86] Everywhere he goes,
[4297.22 → 4299.16] the kingdom of heaven breaks in.
[4300.28 → 4302.08] Darkness is pushed back,
[4302.70 → 4305.02] and creation itself starts to heal.
[4306.12 → 4308.02] Jesus isn't just announcing a kingdom.
[4308.24 → 4309.48] He's enacting one.
[4310.92 → 4311.66] And so this morning,
[4312.30 → 4313.20] behold your king.
[4313.20 → 4315.80] What I would like us to do,
[4315.98 → 4316.94] this is why I encourage you
[4316.94 → 4317.86] to have a Bible open,
[4318.50 → 4319.52] is to quickly,
[4319.70 → 4321.22] we're going to scan through
[4321.22 → 4322.88] these few chapters of Matthew
[4322.88 → 4326.28] and trace the line of Jesus' authority
[4326.28 → 4328.26] and see it for ourselves.
[4329.36 → 4330.34] So Bible's open.
[4331.06 → 4332.36] Start in chapter 8,
[4333.22 → 4334.94] where we see and read
[4334.94 → 4335.84] in this first place
[4335.84 → 4337.80] that Jesus has authority
[4337.80 → 4339.92] over disease,
[4340.36 → 4341.62] over illnesses.
[4341.62 → 4343.38] So chapter 8,
[4343.46 → 4344.04] verse 3,
[4344.42 → 4346.20] immediately he was cleansed
[4346.20 → 4346.98] of leprosy.
[4347.66 → 4348.58] Verse 13,
[4348.70 → 4349.94] his servant was healed
[4349.94 → 4350.80] at that moment.
[4351.74 → 4352.42] Verse 15,
[4352.52 → 4353.68] he touched her hand
[4353.68 → 4355.46] and the fever left her.
[4356.38 → 4357.90] He said to the paralyzed man,
[4358.00 → 4358.36] get up,
[4358.48 → 4359.02] take your mat,
[4359.10 → 4359.64] and go home.
[4359.66 → 4360.48] And the man got up
[4360.48 → 4361.12] and went home.
[4361.34 → 4362.72] And when the crowd saw this,
[4362.78 → 4363.86] they were filled with awe
[4363.86 → 4365.26] and they praised God.
[4365.26 → 4367.22] Who had given such authority
[4367.22 → 4367.84] to man?
[4368.92 → 4369.96] Right in chapter 9,
[4369.96 → 4371.42] to the woman who had
[4371.42 → 4372.36] the blood disorder,
[4373.14 → 4373.76] Jesus said,
[4374.08 → 4375.14] take heart, daughter.
[4375.50 → 4377.40] Your faith has healed you.
[4377.64 → 4379.06] And the woman was healed
[4379.06 → 4380.32] at that moment,
[4380.64 → 4381.10] we read.
[4382.46 → 4384.08] And in chapter 9,
[4384.14 → 4384.66] verse 30,
[4385.00 → 4386.24] he touched the eyes
[4386.24 → 4387.34] of the blind man
[4387.34 → 4388.62] and their sight
[4388.62 → 4390.26] was restored.
[4390.90 → 4392.00] Jesus has authority
[4392.00 → 4393.40] over disease.
[4394.04 → 4395.54] Jesus also has authority
[4395.54 → 4396.98] over demons.
[4396.98 → 4398.80] in chapter 8 again,
[4398.88 → 4399.56] verse 17,
[4400.00 → 4401.56] many who were demon-possessed
[4401.56 → 4402.48] were brought to him
[4402.48 → 4403.48] and he drove out
[4403.48 → 4404.66] the spirits with a word.
[4405.62 → 4406.62] We read the story
[4406.62 → 4408.66] of him casting out demons
[4408.66 → 4409.52] from two men
[4409.52 → 4410.90] and the demons beg him
[4410.90 → 4411.82] to send them
[4411.82 → 4412.56] into the pigs.
[4413.12 → 4413.70] And then the pigs
[4413.70 → 4415.06] went into the whole herd
[4415.06 → 4416.28] and that rushed down the hill
[4416.28 → 4417.22] into the water
[4417.22 → 4417.76] and drowned.
[4418.90 → 4419.98] Jesus has authority
[4419.98 → 4420.64] over disease
[4420.64 → 4421.68] and over demons.
[4422.48 → 4423.58] And we read
[4423.58 → 4424.78] that Jesus has authority
[4424.78 → 4426.10] over the natural world.
[4426.10 → 4427.06] Again,
[4427.14 → 4427.78] in chapter 8,
[4427.86 → 4428.46] he got up,
[4428.64 → 4429.48] rebuked the wind
[4429.48 → 4430.14] and the waves
[4430.14 → 4432.38] and it was completely calm.
[4433.70 → 4434.56] Jesus has authority
[4434.56 → 4435.18] over disease,
[4435.48 → 4436.02] over demons,
[4436.18 → 4437.28] over the natural world
[4437.28 → 4439.28] and Jesus has the authority
[4439.28 → 4441.20] to forgive sins.
[4442.30 → 4442.94] We read,
[4443.52 → 4444.94] when he saw their faith,
[4445.06 → 4446.08] he said to the man,
[4446.52 → 4447.78] take heart, son.
[4448.50 → 4451.30] Your sins are forgiven.
[4451.30 → 4454.46] And Jesus has authority
[4454.46 → 4455.16] over death.
[4455.80 → 4456.46] In chapter 9,
[4456.74 → 4457.18] we read that
[4457.18 → 4457.74] when the daughter
[4457.74 → 4459.30] of the synagogue ruler died,
[4459.62 → 4460.42] after the crowd
[4460.42 → 4461.42] had been put outside,
[4461.56 → 4462.22] he went in,
[4462.48 → 4463.64] he took her by the hand
[4463.64 → 4464.96] and she got up.
[4466.86 → 4467.08] Right?
[4467.12 → 4468.12] He has authority
[4468.12 → 4469.10] over disease,
[4469.60 → 4470.66] he has authority
[4470.66 → 4471.52] over demons,
[4472.00 → 4473.28] over the natural world,
[4473.40 → 4474.32] he has the authority
[4474.32 → 4475.34] to forgive sins
[4475.34 → 4476.36] and he has authority
[4476.36 → 4477.30] over death.
[4477.30 → 4479.28] And because he has
[4479.28 → 4480.62] all of that authority,
[4481.16 → 4482.66] Jesus uses that authority
[4482.66 → 4484.82] to send out his disciples.
[4485.08 → 4485.60] And he says,
[4485.68 → 4486.22] as we read,
[4486.54 → 4487.96] the harvest is plentiful,
[4488.40 → 4489.42] but the workers are few.
[4490.42 → 4491.66] Ask the Lord of the harvest,
[4491.82 → 4492.10] therefore,
[4492.20 → 4493.06] to send workers
[4493.06 → 4494.48] out into his field.
[4494.74 → 4495.82] And then he shares
[4495.82 → 4496.80] that authority
[4496.80 → 4498.42] with his disciples.
[4499.10 → 4500.26] Chapter 10, verse 1,
[4500.68 → 4501.22] says that
[4501.22 → 4502.92] he called his 12 disciples
[4502.92 → 4503.50] to him
[4503.50 → 4504.94] and gave them authority
[4504.94 → 4506.92] to drive out impure spirits
[4506.92 → 4508.72] to heal every disease
[4508.72 → 4509.66] and sickness.
[4511.88 → 4512.08] Right?
[4512.10 → 4513.34] We're beginning to behold.
[4514.62 → 4514.84] Right?
[4514.88 → 4516.60] This is no ordinary teacher.
[4517.54 → 4519.74] This is no mere miracle worker.
[4520.10 → 4521.22] This is the king
[4521.22 → 4522.96] walking among us,
[4523.70 → 4524.74] wielding authority
[4524.74 → 4526.76] that belongs to God alone.
[4527.66 → 4527.86] Right?
[4527.92 → 4528.68] Every healing,
[4528.88 → 4529.70] every command,
[4529.88 → 4531.24] every act of compassion
[4531.24 → 4532.82] is a royal decree
[4532.82 → 4535.06] that the kingdom of God
[4535.06 → 4536.40] has come near.
[4536.92 → 4538.10] The kingdom of God
[4538.10 → 4538.64] has come near
[4538.64 → 4539.80] and we begin now
[4539.80 → 4541.26] to see it clearly.
[4542.42 → 4542.54] Right?
[4542.62 → 4544.36] Jesus has unmatched
[4544.36 → 4547.06] real divine authority
[4547.06 → 4548.34] over disease
[4548.34 → 4549.02] and demons
[4549.02 → 4549.64] and death
[4549.64 → 4550.30] and nature,
[4550.62 → 4551.32] over sin.
[4551.60 → 4552.36] And his words
[4552.36 → 4553.34] don't just teach,
[4553.50 → 4554.12] they command,
[4554.50 → 4555.66] they don't just explain,
[4555.82 → 4557.74] they define reality.
[4558.48 → 4559.18] His touch
[4559.18 → 4560.30] doesn't just comfort,
[4560.62 → 4561.50] it restores.
[4562.46 → 4563.14] His presence
[4563.14 → 4564.38] doesn't just inspire,
[4564.38 → 4565.72] it transforms.
[4568.22 → 4569.16] And yet,
[4570.16 → 4572.36] there's a bit of a tension here.
[4572.84 → 4573.08] Right?
[4575.14 → 4576.78] Because we believe all that
[4576.78 → 4579.44] and still,
[4580.06 → 4581.66] life doesn't always
[4581.66 → 4584.10] reflect that authority
[4584.10 → 4585.98] in the ways that we expect.
[4587.26 → 4587.76] Right?
[4587.88 → 4589.08] Illness lingers.
[4589.08 → 4591.96] storms rage,
[4592.46 → 4594.20] loved ones die,
[4595.54 → 4597.60] prayers go unanswered.
[4598.52 → 4599.50] Deep down,
[4599.94 → 4600.62] we ask,
[4601.26 → 4602.54] if Jesus really has
[4602.54 → 4603.42] all that authority,
[4603.60 → 4603.90] pastor,
[4604.64 → 4605.92] why is my life
[4605.92 → 4607.14] still so full of pain?
[4609.04 → 4610.44] Why is everything around me
[4610.44 → 4611.10] still so broken?
[4611.10 → 4613.70] And that's where
[4613.70 → 4614.30] the heart begins
[4614.30 → 4614.80] to wrestle.
[4616.60 → 4617.98] And I suggest to you,
[4619.10 → 4620.34] that is where
[4620.34 → 4621.54] real discipleship
[4621.54 → 4622.42] begins.
[4624.92 → 4625.94] Because if Jesus
[4625.94 → 4626.70] is king,
[4627.36 → 4627.94] and I believe
[4627.94 → 4628.54] with all my heart
[4628.54 → 4629.02] that he is,
[4629.54 → 4630.88] if he truly has
[4630.88 → 4631.84] that kind of authority,
[4631.92 → 4632.40] and I believe
[4632.40 → 4633.52] that he really does,
[4633.94 → 4635.26] then we also have to face
[4635.26 → 4636.32] the deeper question,
[4637.44 → 4637.60] right?
[4637.74 → 4638.14] Not,
[4638.40 → 4639.48] can he act?
[4639.48 → 4639.84] But,
[4640.32 → 4643.80] why doesn't he act
[4643.80 → 4645.28] the way I want him to?
[4647.52 → 4648.26] And it's not just
[4648.26 → 4649.00] a question of faith,
[4649.06 → 4650.06] it's a question of trust.
[4650.76 → 4650.88] Right?
[4650.90 → 4651.62] And at that moment,
[4651.72 → 4652.94] it's a call to worship
[4652.94 → 4654.90] even when we don't understand.
[4656.76 → 4657.82] Jesus presents us
[4657.82 → 4658.58] with a straightforward
[4658.58 → 4660.56] truth at this moment.
[4661.42 → 4661.70] Right?
[4662.46 → 4662.90] Saying,
[4663.10 → 4664.12] if you want a God
[4664.12 → 4665.36] who is powerful enough
[4665.36 → 4666.48] to heal your diseases
[4666.48 → 4667.76] and to cast out demons,
[4667.76 → 4669.16] a God who is powerful
[4669.16 → 4670.20] enough to control
[4670.20 → 4670.88] the seas
[4670.88 → 4672.04] and all the chaoses
[4672.04 → 4672.78] of your life,
[4672.90 → 4674.18] if you want a Jesus
[4674.18 → 4675.30] who can legitimately
[4675.30 → 4676.58] forgive your sins,
[4676.86 → 4678.26] who can raise the dead,
[4678.36 → 4679.20] who can command
[4679.20 → 4680.34] angel armies,
[4680.54 → 4681.66] who can send out
[4681.66 → 4682.90] waves of disciples,
[4684.78 → 4685.24] in short,
[4685.32 → 4686.22] if you want a Jesus
[4686.22 → 4687.92] with that kind of authority
[4687.92 → 4689.78] in and over the world,
[4690.78 → 4693.00] you must also accept
[4693.00 → 4694.48] a Jesus,
[4695.06 → 4696.98] a God revealed in Jesus,
[4696.98 → 4698.80] who is powerful enough,
[4699.44 → 4700.30] infinite enough,
[4700.86 → 4701.64] wise enough,
[4701.64 → 4703.18] to have reasons
[4703.18 → 4705.32] to let you endure
[4705.32 → 4708.32] such hard things.
[4710.12 → 4711.86] You can't have it both ways.
[4713.76 → 4714.54] Tim Keller,
[4715.22 → 4716.00] author and preacher
[4716.00 → 4717.58] that I have a lot of respect for,
[4717.68 → 4718.38] puts it this way.
[4718.46 → 4718.80] He says,
[4718.80 → 4720.88] if you have a God
[4720.88 → 4721.60] great enough
[4721.60 → 4722.68] and powerful enough
[4722.68 → 4723.74] to be mad at
[4723.74 → 4724.60] because he doesn't
[4724.60 → 4725.60] stop your suffering,
[4726.36 → 4727.74] you also have a God
[4727.74 → 4728.48] who's great enough
[4728.48 → 4729.38] and powerful enough
[4729.38 → 4730.14] to have reasons
[4730.14 → 4731.40] that you can't understand.
[4734.30 → 4735.24] Here's the thing.
[4736.74 → 4738.12] If you really believe
[4738.12 → 4739.10] that Jesus has
[4739.10 → 4740.38] this kind of authority
[4740.38 → 4741.14] over sickness
[4741.14 → 4741.74] and storms
[4741.74 → 4742.24] and demons
[4742.24 → 4742.68] and death,
[4742.88 → 4743.86] over every sin,
[4744.70 → 4746.08] then you have to
[4746.08 → 4747.22] deal with the
[4747.22 → 4748.70] possibly uncomfortable
[4748.70 → 4750.04] truth that he doesn't
[4750.04 → 4751.68] always use that authority
[4751.68 → 4752.94] in the way we think
[4752.94 → 4753.40] he should,
[4754.40 → 4754.92] in the way that
[4754.92 → 4755.86] we expect him to.
[4756.46 → 4756.98] And that's where
[4756.98 → 4758.36] this tension creeps in
[4758.36 → 4759.56] because we want a king
[4759.56 → 4761.34] who calms our storms,
[4761.50 → 4763.06] who heals our pain,
[4763.14 → 4764.50] who answers our prayers
[4764.50 → 4765.90] in the way that we want
[4765.90 → 4767.10] and when we want.
[4768.12 → 4769.42] This has been a conversation
[4769.42 → 4770.36] throughout the history
[4770.36 → 4771.34] of the church.
[4772.52 → 4773.36] The Christians
[4773.36 → 4774.72] of the earliest church
[4774.72 → 4776.78] understood this
[4776.78 → 4779.28] experienced tension
[4779.28 → 4781.10] and they insisted
[4781.10 → 4782.42] over and over again
[4782.42 → 4783.00] that God
[4783.00 → 4784.34] is not just
[4784.34 → 4785.62] bigger than us,
[4787.06 → 4787.34] right?
[4787.44 → 4787.64] Like,
[4788.36 → 4789.10] but actually
[4789.10 → 4789.78] that God is
[4789.78 → 4791.08] beyond us
[4791.08 → 4793.48] and that because of that
[4793.48 → 4794.32] all of our language
[4794.32 → 4794.80] for God,
[4794.90 → 4795.90] the way we talk about God,
[4795.98 → 4797.12] the way we experience God
[4797.12 → 4798.30] has to be
[4798.30 → 4798.96] what's called
[4798.96 → 4799.88] analogical,
[4800.00 → 4800.74] that is by way
[4800.74 → 4801.50] of analogy,
[4802.58 → 4802.82] right?
[4802.92 → 4803.76] And so we learn
[4803.76 → 4804.76] that we can describe
[4804.76 → 4805.50] him truly
[4805.50 → 4807.32] but we can never
[4807.32 → 4808.40] describe him fully.
[4809.68 → 4810.44] That's what we mean
[4810.44 → 4810.88] when we say
[4810.88 → 4812.40] our language is by analogy.
[4812.76 → 4813.90] We can describe him truly
[4813.90 → 4815.36] but never fully,
[4816.48 → 4816.62] right?
[4816.66 → 4817.22] And in that,
[4817.34 → 4818.70] God is not just
[4818.70 → 4819.32] the biggest
[4819.32 → 4820.68] and best version
[4820.68 → 4821.54] of us,
[4822.32 → 4823.36] right?
[4823.40 → 4823.78] Instead,
[4824.06 → 4825.18] God is the creator.
[4825.86 → 4827.00] God is the only
[4827.00 → 4828.40] uncreated one,
[4828.60 → 4830.78] the only infinite one.
[4830.78 → 4832.56] One of my favourite
[4832.56 → 4833.74] authors right now,
[4833.80 → 4834.50] he put it this way,
[4834.56 → 4834.84] he said,
[4835.18 → 4836.18] it would be strange
[4836.18 → 4837.40] indeed if God
[4837.40 → 4838.26] were not strange.
[4840.46 → 4841.08] That's why
[4841.08 → 4842.04] Saint Augustine,
[4842.34 → 4843.22] a fourth century
[4843.22 → 4843.96] church father,
[4844.34 → 4845.18] said it this way,
[4845.42 → 4845.68] he said,
[4845.78 → 4846.96] if you understand it,
[4847.42 → 4848.44] it is not God.
[4850.52 → 4851.46] In other words,
[4852.12 → 4853.38] if every part of your life
[4853.38 → 4853.96] with God
[4853.96 → 4854.70] makes sense,
[4855.16 → 4856.24] if your theology
[4856.24 → 4857.60] never surprises you,
[4857.60 → 4858.66] if God never
[4858.66 → 4859.68] unsettles you,
[4860.16 → 4861.08] if your prayers
[4861.08 → 4862.02] always get answered
[4862.02 → 4862.94] in ways that feel
[4862.94 → 4863.68] good to you,
[4864.48 → 4865.50] you might not be
[4865.50 → 4866.86] dealing with
[4866.86 → 4867.52] the real God.
[4869.90 → 4872.06] Behold your king.
[4873.00 → 4874.30] He is powerful enough
[4874.30 → 4875.40] to calm the storm
[4875.40 → 4876.96] and wise enough
[4876.96 → 4878.26] to let you go through it.
[4879.74 → 4881.60] And because he is God,
[4881.68 → 4882.70] not one of us,
[4882.96 → 4884.08] he doesn't owe us
[4884.08 → 4884.90] an explanation
[4884.90 → 4885.78] beyond,
[4886.04 → 4887.04] I am God,
[4887.04 → 4888.04] there is no one
[4888.04 → 4888.62] like me,
[4888.90 → 4889.68] I am good.
[4891.18 → 4892.12] And yet,
[4892.62 → 4894.26] he doesn't give us
[4894.26 → 4894.88] an explanation,
[4895.20 → 4895.62] he gives us
[4895.62 → 4896.20] something better,
[4896.56 → 4896.72] right?
[4896.76 → 4897.62] He gives us Jesus.
[4900.18 → 4900.62] Jesus,
[4900.78 → 4901.36] God himself
[4901.36 → 4902.06] who came down
[4902.06 → 4902.80] into this world,
[4902.90 → 4903.66] who lived the life
[4903.66 → 4904.30] I should have lived,
[4904.52 → 4905.42] who died the death
[4905.42 → 4905.92] that I deserve,
[4906.14 → 4907.56] who stood in my place
[4907.56 → 4907.98] and said,
[4908.30 → 4909.66] you belong to me,
[4910.30 → 4911.08] come what may,
[4911.76 → 4912.68] no matter what storm
[4912.68 → 4913.16] you face,
[4913.20 → 4914.78] I will never let you go.
[4914.86 → 4915.40] No matter who
[4915.40 → 4916.36] in your life dies
[4916.36 → 4918.02] and wrecks your circumstance,
[4918.18 → 4920.04] I will never let you go.
[4920.20 → 4921.16] No matter what valley
[4921.16 → 4922.18] of the shadow of death
[4922.18 → 4922.76] you walk through
[4922.76 → 4923.92] or dark night of the soul,
[4924.28 → 4925.06] Jesus says,
[4925.28 → 4927.56] I will never let you go.
[4929.82 → 4930.94] Behold your king.
[4931.90 → 4932.92] He is God.
[4933.36 → 4934.42] He has authority
[4934.42 → 4935.36] to heal disease,
[4935.50 → 4936.16] to send demons
[4936.16 → 4936.82] back to hell,
[4936.94 → 4937.66] to bring order
[4937.66 → 4938.34] out of chaos
[4938.34 → 4939.40] and to raise the dead,
[4939.40 → 4941.78] and he is God enough
[4941.78 → 4943.72] to let you endure
[4943.72 → 4944.52] the storm.
[4945.84 → 4946.72] He is God
[4946.72 → 4948.48] and you are not.
[4949.02 → 4950.16] If everything God did
[4950.16 → 4951.14] or didn't do
[4951.14 → 4952.28] made sense to us,
[4952.42 → 4953.12] he would cease
[4953.12 → 4953.74] to be God.
[4956.28 → 4957.18] Now this way
[4957.18 → 4958.88] of relating to God,
[4958.96 → 4959.86] of understanding
[4959.86 → 4960.94] however feebly
[4960.94 → 4961.98] it may be
[4961.98 → 4963.26] who God is,
[4963.66 → 4965.66] this way of seeing God
[4965.66 → 4967.08] has changed the way
[4967.08 → 4968.48] that I relate to him.
[4970.26 → 4970.94] And so yeah,
[4971.02 → 4971.74] I will pray
[4971.74 → 4972.26] for God
[4972.26 → 4973.34] to end my trial,
[4974.06 → 4975.76] but then I will also pray
[4975.76 → 4976.46] that he causes me
[4976.46 → 4977.04] to persevere.
[4978.56 → 4979.54] I have learned
[4979.54 → 4980.14] to pray
[4980.14 → 4980.86] for healing
[4980.86 → 4981.92] in my life
[4981.92 → 4982.48] or in the life
[4982.48 → 4982.84] of people
[4982.84 → 4983.44] that I love,
[4984.28 → 4985.96] but I am also
[4985.96 → 4986.68] learning to pray
[4986.68 → 4987.50] for strength
[4987.50 → 4988.46] to wait
[4988.46 → 4989.54] in God's wisdom.
[4991.18 → 4991.62] Right?
[4991.64 → 4992.84] When God feels hidden,
[4993.16 → 4994.36] I pray for eyes
[4994.36 → 4995.28] to see God
[4995.28 → 4995.76] at work,
[4995.90 → 4996.88] but I also pray
[4996.88 → 4997.44] for a heart
[4997.44 → 4998.20] that trusts
[4998.20 → 4999.34] when I can't see him.
[5000.90 → 5002.12] And when I find myself
[5002.12 → 5002.98] falling prey
[5002.98 → 5003.86] to the gospel
[5003.86 → 5004.56] of self,
[5005.42 → 5006.42] I invite God
[5006.42 → 5007.12] to break me,
[5007.66 → 5008.80] to humble me.
[5009.54 → 5010.80] When I make confession
[5010.80 → 5012.20] that I have placed myself
[5012.20 → 5013.42] back on the throne
[5013.42 → 5014.36] of my life,
[5014.50 → 5015.38] I will literally
[5015.38 → 5016.86] in my Holy Spirit
[5016.86 → 5017.58] imagination
[5017.58 → 5018.84] envision Christ
[5018.84 → 5019.68] walking up
[5019.68 → 5020.32] to the throne
[5020.32 → 5021.14] which looks remarkably
[5021.14 → 5021.90] like my heart
[5021.90 → 5023.36] and cleaning it off,
[5023.58 → 5024.54] cleansing it anew,
[5024.86 → 5025.32] and then have,
[5025.56 → 5026.54] I envision Christ
[5026.54 → 5028.04] sitting down there
[5028.04 → 5029.26] on that rightful place
[5029.26 → 5029.88] again,
[5030.06 → 5030.86] and I bow
[5030.86 → 5032.36] before him.
[5037.58 → 5038.72] All of this
[5038.72 → 5040.62] puts us
[5040.62 → 5041.78] in one of two places
[5041.78 → 5042.92] this morning.
[5044.18 → 5045.44] Can you behold
[5045.44 → 5046.02] your king?
[5047.54 → 5048.78] Or do you not yet
[5048.78 → 5049.22] see him?
[5049.22 → 5052.50] And if you do not
[5052.50 → 5053.24] yet see him,
[5055.02 → 5056.06] if you haven't yet
[5056.06 → 5057.38] known him,
[5058.34 → 5059.76] ask him this morning
[5059.76 → 5060.68] to show himself
[5060.68 → 5061.74] to you.
[5062.72 → 5063.76] Put your whole heart
[5063.76 → 5064.46] and mind
[5064.46 → 5065.50] into finding him,
[5065.76 → 5067.04] into hearing his voice.
[5068.50 → 5070.12] Hang out with church people
[5070.12 → 5070.74] for a year
[5070.74 → 5071.86] and go to whatever class
[5071.86 → 5072.62] they put on
[5072.62 → 5074.06] and be there
[5074.06 → 5075.14] asking good questions
[5075.14 → 5077.94] and see what God can do.
[5077.94 → 5081.34] read his word.
[5082.18 → 5083.26] Listen to his people.
[5084.40 → 5085.24] And if you're stuck
[5085.24 → 5086.32] in a stubborn heart
[5086.32 → 5087.54] that is still confessing
[5087.54 → 5088.08] no gods,
[5088.16 → 5088.68] no masters,
[5088.94 → 5090.12] if maybe the gospel
[5090.12 → 5090.48] of,
[5090.76 → 5091.70] the modern gospel
[5091.70 → 5092.94] of self-actualization
[5092.94 → 5094.28] hasn't failed you yet
[5094.28 → 5095.62] and it will fail you,
[5096.32 → 5097.18] but maybe you're not
[5097.18 → 5097.66] there yet,
[5098.40 → 5100.94] if you're not here yet
[5100.94 → 5102.16] to see and hear
[5102.16 → 5103.96] Jesus as your king,
[5103.96 → 5106.36] can I just say
[5106.36 → 5107.74] I'm so glad
[5107.74 → 5108.52] that you are here.
[5110.12 → 5111.44] I'm so excited
[5111.44 → 5112.40] that you have
[5112.40 → 5113.54] taken the risk
[5113.54 → 5114.74] to be with us
[5114.74 → 5115.78] this morning.
[5117.00 → 5118.06] And if that's you,
[5118.30 → 5119.26] I want to talk to you.
[5120.34 → 5120.70] Honestly,
[5120.80 → 5121.88] Dave wants to talk to you.
[5123.16 → 5123.94] Any of us
[5123.94 → 5124.98] who call this church home
[5124.98 → 5126.24] want to talk to you
[5126.24 → 5127.44] and walk with you
[5127.44 → 5128.90] and answer your questions.
[5129.02 → 5129.82] We are a place
[5129.82 → 5130.62] where you can ask
[5130.62 → 5131.30] your questions.
[5132.42 → 5132.92] Our questions
[5132.92 → 5133.76] will never run out
[5133.76 → 5135.40] and so neither will
[5135.40 → 5136.20] our time for them.
[5138.68 → 5139.60] But this,
[5140.36 → 5142.46] this Jesus
[5142.46 → 5143.96] has authority
[5143.96 → 5145.08] over disease
[5145.08 → 5146.10] and demons
[5146.10 → 5147.24] and the natural world.
[5147.98 → 5149.58] This is Jesus
[5149.58 → 5150.82] and he has authority
[5150.82 → 5151.92] to forgive sins
[5151.92 → 5153.22] and to raise the dead.
[5153.90 → 5154.88] This is Jesus
[5154.88 → 5156.12] and he has the wisdom
[5156.12 → 5157.68] to let you endure
[5157.68 → 5158.88] and the grace
[5158.88 → 5160.48] to persevere you,
[5160.58 → 5162.02] to preserve you
[5162.02 → 5163.78] in that trial.
[5165.64 → 5166.38] And if you're
[5166.38 → 5167.30] in that other place,
[5168.08 → 5168.22] right,
[5168.24 → 5169.28] if you can make
[5169.28 → 5170.02] that profession,
[5170.16 → 5172.08] if that is what you believe,
[5172.18 → 5173.44] if you do behold
[5173.44 → 5174.46] your king today,
[5174.62 → 5175.80] there are two things
[5175.80 → 5177.04] for you to do.
[5178.50 → 5179.02] First,
[5180.02 → 5180.80] chapter 9,
[5180.94 → 5181.48] verse 8.
[5182.16 → 5183.20] We read this already.
[5183.20 → 5184.66] When the crowds
[5184.66 → 5185.62] saw this,
[5185.98 → 5186.68] they were filled
[5186.68 → 5187.38] with awe
[5187.38 → 5188.60] and they praised
[5188.60 → 5189.80] God who had given
[5189.80 → 5190.90] such authority
[5190.90 → 5192.04] to man.
[5194.18 → 5194.38] Right,
[5194.42 → 5195.42] the first response
[5195.42 → 5196.06] that you have
[5196.06 → 5197.02] in seeing Jesus
[5197.02 → 5197.48] this way
[5197.48 → 5198.12] is to worship.
[5199.16 → 5200.32] To worship him
[5200.32 → 5200.96] with awe
[5200.96 → 5202.34] and to praise his name.
[5203.22 → 5204.00] And so just a moment
[5204.00 → 5204.74] when we sing
[5204.74 → 5206.60] our song of response,
[5206.76 → 5207.64] sing a little louder,
[5207.84 → 5208.26] would you?
[5209.48 → 5209.94] Right,
[5209.94 → 5210.52] and then carry
[5210.52 → 5211.18] that worship
[5211.18 → 5212.14] into tomorrow.
[5213.40 → 5214.18] May your work,
[5214.52 → 5215.16] you're parenting,
[5215.48 → 5216.18] you're playing,
[5216.54 → 5217.62] you're camping,
[5217.82 → 5218.84] and you're kayaking,
[5219.12 → 5219.76] whatever it is
[5219.76 → 5220.34] that you do,
[5220.54 → 5221.38] may it be filled
[5221.38 → 5222.10] with worship.
[5223.36 → 5224.24] Sing songs
[5224.24 → 5225.76] with all of your life
[5225.76 → 5227.02] and may your life
[5227.02 → 5228.10] sing songs.
[5230.80 → 5231.66] And second,
[5232.18 → 5233.80] as we read,
[5234.52 → 5235.34] ask the Lord
[5235.34 → 5235.92] of the harvest
[5235.92 → 5236.86] to send workers
[5236.86 → 5238.12] out into the harvest
[5238.12 → 5238.86] field.
[5241.86 → 5242.46] Pray
[5242.46 → 5244.22] for God's mission
[5244.22 → 5245.36] to the neighbourhood
[5245.36 → 5246.66] and to the world.
[5247.46 → 5249.00] Pray that in our midst
[5249.00 → 5249.68] today,
[5250.02 → 5251.22] maybe even right now,
[5251.44 → 5252.50] God would raise up
[5252.50 → 5253.26] missionaries
[5253.26 → 5254.16] and pastors
[5254.16 → 5255.50] and evangelists
[5255.50 → 5256.44] and preachers
[5256.44 → 5257.76] to go into the world
[5257.76 → 5258.44] and to declare
[5258.44 → 5259.40] the praises of him
[5259.40 → 5260.32] who brought you
[5260.32 → 5260.80] and me
[5260.80 → 5261.62] out of darkness
[5261.62 → 5262.56] and into his
[5262.56 → 5263.24] wonderful light.
[5263.24 → 5265.18] And when you see
[5265.18 → 5265.84] that gift
[5265.84 → 5267.32] in a young man
[5267.32 → 5267.92] or woman,
[5268.08 → 5269.10] would you encourage them?
[5271.46 → 5272.00] Then,
[5272.72 → 5274.80] be the answer
[5274.80 → 5275.54] to your prayer.
[5277.16 → 5277.38] Right?
[5277.46 → 5278.38] You yourself
[5278.38 → 5279.68] be a worker
[5279.68 → 5280.70] who understands
[5280.70 → 5281.30] that the harvest
[5281.30 → 5282.10] is plentiful.
[5283.28 → 5283.42] Right?
[5283.48 → 5286.08] In your own ways,
[5286.58 → 5287.92] God is commissioning
[5287.92 → 5289.18] each one of you
[5289.18 → 5290.42] to be a worker
[5290.42 → 5291.38] in the harvest.
[5292.46 → 5293.42] To be a Christian,
[5293.64 → 5293.84] right,
[5293.88 → 5294.58] is to share
[5294.58 → 5295.42] in the anointing
[5295.42 → 5295.96] of Christ
[5295.96 → 5297.14] and to be sent
[5297.14 → 5298.42] as he was sent.
[5299.70 → 5300.68] And as we heard
[5300.68 → 5301.30] this morning,
[5302.66 → 5304.60] even the littlest
[5304.60 → 5305.86] among us
[5305.86 → 5307.16] are called
[5307.16 → 5307.96] with that mission.
[5309.60 → 5310.52] Dave said
[5310.52 → 5311.24] he's here
[5311.24 → 5312.40] because his daughter
[5312.40 → 5312.88] was having
[5312.88 → 5313.54] a conversation
[5313.54 → 5314.50] with their friends
[5314.50 → 5315.52] about Jesus.
[5317.42 → 5317.94] Guys,
[5318.52 → 5319.74] why are some of us
[5319.74 → 5320.34] scared to have
[5320.34 → 5320.84] conversations
[5320.84 → 5321.44] with our friends
[5321.44 → 5322.04] about Jesus?
[5322.84 → 5323.60] Out of the mouths
[5323.60 → 5324.10] of children
[5324.10 → 5325.10] and infants,
[5325.22 → 5326.42] you have ordained praise.
[5327.78 → 5328.66] Maybe some of us
[5328.66 → 5329.22] need to be more
[5329.22 → 5329.72] like children
[5329.72 → 5330.78] in our faith again.
[5332.36 → 5333.72] Sharing this testimony.
[5334.52 → 5335.38] Inviting people
[5335.38 → 5336.84] to see Jesus.
[5337.08 → 5337.78] Inviting people
[5337.78 → 5339.66] to receive Jesus.
[5342.54 → 5343.28] I'm going to be
[5343.28 → 5343.94] candid with you.
[5345.20 → 5346.10] The devil hates
[5346.10 → 5346.84] days like today.
[5346.84 → 5349.48] He hates moments
[5349.48 → 5350.10] like this.
[5351.64 → 5353.64] This is the mission
[5353.64 → 5354.82] of the church.
[5355.68 → 5356.76] This is what happens
[5356.76 → 5357.64] when we see
[5357.64 → 5358.56] Jesus
[5358.56 → 5359.28] worship,
[5359.88 → 5360.28] pray,
[5360.48 → 5361.28] and go.
[5362.28 → 5363.46] This is
[5363.46 → 5364.32] Jesus.
[5364.94 → 5365.56] Behold
[5365.56 → 5366.44] your
[5366.44 → 5367.52] king.
[5368.38 → 5368.70] Amen.
[5369.54 → 5370.70] Let's pray together.
[5370.70 → 5370.76] Amen.
[5370.76 → 5370.82] Amen.
[5370.82 → 5371.26] Amen.
