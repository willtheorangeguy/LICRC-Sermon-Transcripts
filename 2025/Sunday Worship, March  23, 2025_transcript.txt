[0.00 --> 4.10]  There's a day that is coming
[4.10 --> 8.34]  When all the last will be first
[8.34 --> 11.90]  Every orphan will be home
[11.90 --> 13.94]  And all will be filled
[13.94 --> 16.40]  With hunger and thirst
[16.40 --> 19.96]  It's gonna be a celebration
[19.96 --> 23.26]  All our creation longs for
[23.26 --> 27.16]  And while we're waiting for that day
[27.16 --> 29.18]  To come
[29.18 --> 31.88]  We've got a little more time
[31.88 --> 34.02]  To do justly
[34.02 --> 35.94]  And love mercy
[35.94 --> 39.14]  And show the love we've been shown
[39.14 --> 41.76]  For we can only be
[41.76 --> 45.36]  The hands and feet of Jesus
[45.36 --> 49.24]  Till He leads us home
[49.24 --> 55.46]  He will lead us home
[59.18 --> 63.34]  There's a day that is coming
[63.34 --> 67.34]  A day that ever will end
[67.34 --> 71.18]  There in the light of His glory
[71.18 --> 75.14]  Everything broken will be whole again
[75.14 --> 79.02]  And this will be the celebration
[79.02 --> 81.90]  All our creation longs for
[81.90 --> 86.22]  And while we're waiting for that day
[86.22 --> 88.18]  To come
[88.18 --> 90.88]  We've got a little more time
[90.88 --> 92.58]  To love
[92.58 --> 98.98]  Just a little more time
[98.98 --> 99.58]  To love
[99.58 --> 103.08]  Just a little more time
[103.08 --> 103.84]  To love
[103.84 --> 116.54]  Just a little more time
[116.54 --> 118.54]  To love
[118.54 --> 124.38]  Peter Lamote
[124.38 --> 124.92]  There in the light of his mother
[124.98 --> 125.46]  To come
[125.54 --> 126.76]  There in the night
[126.98 --> 128.38]  Peace
[128.38 --> 129.38]  Louis
[129.38 --> 130.92]  Alec
[131.14 --> 131.54]  Andерт
[131.90 --> 132.80]  In the night
[132.84 --> 133.34]  Loan
[133.34 --> 133.72] que
[133.72 --> 163.70]  I love you.
[163.72 --> 172.46]  I've heard a thousand stories of what they think you're like.
[172.80 --> 182.32]  But I've heard the tender whisper of love in the dead of night.
[182.32 --> 191.18]  And you tell me that you're pleased and that I'm never alone.
[191.18 --> 196.16]  You're a good, good father.
[196.64 --> 198.24]  It's who you are.
[198.92 --> 200.52]  It's who you are.
[201.12 --> 202.92]  It's who you are.
[202.92 --> 206.06]  And I'm loved by you.
[206.48 --> 208.02]  It's who I am.
[208.66 --> 210.62]  It's who I am.
[211.32 --> 213.90]  It's who I am.
[213.90 --> 223.90]  Oh, and I've seen many searching for answers.
[224.90 --> 227.10]  Far and wide.
[227.10 --> 234.06]  But I know we're all searching for answers.
[234.48 --> 237.32]  Only you provide cause.
[237.38 --> 245.56]  You know just what we need before we say a word.
[245.56 --> 248.32]  And you're a good, good father.
[248.74 --> 250.22]  It's who you are.
[250.84 --> 252.72]  It's who you are.
[253.30 --> 255.12]  It's who you are.
[255.58 --> 258.04]  And I'm loved by you.
[258.48 --> 260.18]  It's who I am.
[260.18 --> 262.18]  It's who I am.
[262.18 --> 265.18]  It's who I am.
[265.18 --> 270.86]  Because you are perfect in all of your ways.
[271.24 --> 275.94]  You are perfect in all of your ways.
[275.94 --> 284.72]  You are perfect in all of your ways to us.
[284.72 --> 311.66]  Oh, it's love so undeniable.
[311.66 --> 317.66]  I can hardly speak peace.
[317.66 --> 321.78]  So unexplainable.
[321.78 --> 328.96]  I can hardly think as you call me.
[329.36 --> 333.90]  Deeper still as you call me.
[334.34 --> 338.88]  Deeper still as you call me.
[338.88 --> 342.62]  Deeper still into love.
[342.98 --> 344.88]  Love, love.
[344.94 --> 347.56]  You're a good, good father.
[348.00 --> 349.50]  It's who you are.
[349.88 --> 352.06]  It's who you are.
[352.56 --> 354.44]  It's who you are.
[354.44 --> 357.50]  And I'm loved by you.
[358.00 --> 359.52]  It's who I am.
[360.06 --> 362.12]  It's who I am.
[362.74 --> 364.70]  It's who I am.
[364.70 --> 369.70]  It's who you are.
[369.70 --> 371.94]  It's who you are.
[372.44 --> 374.70]  It's who you are.
[374.70 --> 377.32]  And I'm loved by you.
[377.70 --> 379.30]  It's who I am.
[379.70 --> 382.02]  It's who I am.
[382.38 --> 384.26]  It's who I am.
[384.26 --> 388.32]  It's who I am.
[388.32 --> 391.44]  It's who I am.
[391.44 --> 392.52]  It's who you are.
[392.52 --> 394.26]  It's who you are.
[394.26 --> 397.08]  And I'm loved by you.
[397.08 --> 399.30]  It's who I am.
[399.30 --> 401.72]  It's who I am.
[401.72 --> 404.52]  It's who I am.
[404.52 --> 416.52]  It's who I am.
[416.52 --> 419.60]  It's who I am.
[419.60 --> 421.64]  It's who I am.
[422.02 --> 424.06]  It's who I am.
[424.06 --> 454.04]  I love you
[454.06 --> 458.10]  I see you sitting over there with your head in your hands
[458.10 --> 461.04]  And the mess life's made of your best laid plans
[461.04 --> 465.18]  You really want to shake your fist, but you don't know who to blame
[465.18 --> 468.36]  Well, you can blame yourself or the man upstairs
[468.36 --> 470.94]  Or the guy on the screen who says he cares
[470.94 --> 473.70]  But all the shame and the blame won't change a thing
[473.70 --> 475.02]  What's done is done
[475.02 --> 477.88]  Oh, but grace has just begun
[477.88 --> 481.64]  And God says, I'm gonna turn it into something different
[481.64 --> 484.14]  I'm gonna turn it into something good
[484.14 --> 489.36]  I'm gonna take all the broken pieces and make something beautiful like only I could
[489.36 --> 491.96]  So put it all in the hands of the Father
[491.96 --> 499.84]  Give it up, give it all over to the only one who can turn it into something beautiful
[499.84 --> 505.46]  Something really beautiful
[505.46 --> 509.88]  We know the world got broke when it took the fall
[509.88 --> 512.48]  And here we are living in the middle of it all
[512.48 --> 516.68]  Longing, waiting for the day when everything's restored
[516.68 --> 519.98]  But the best of the beauty that we get to see
[519.98 --> 522.72]  While we're living down here and it's yet to be
[522.72 --> 526.56]  Is to watch God take the most broken things and to hear Him say
[526.56 --> 530.22]  When I get through, you're gonna be amazed
[530.22 --> 533.14]  Cause I'm gonna turn it into something different
[533.14 --> 535.74]  I'm gonna turn it into something good
[535.74 --> 540.98]  I'm gonna take all the broken pieces and make something beautiful like only I could
[540.98 --> 543.54]  So put it all in the hands of the Father
[543.54 --> 547.58]  Give it up, give it all over to the only one who can turn it into something good
[547.58 --> 559.90]  Good morning
[559.90 --> 564.66]  There was like a definitive hush that settled over the crowd that time
[564.66 --> 564.94]  Wow
[564.94 --> 567.46]  Welcome to church
[567.46 --> 568.38]  Welcome to worship
[568.38 --> 572.44]  A special welcome if you are a guest here with us this morning
[572.44 --> 573.34]  My name is Chris
[573.34 --> 579.74]  I'm one of the pastors here and it's my privilege to lead in our shared worship together this morning
[579.74 --> 582.54]  Before we begin, we have a couple announcements to make
[582.54 --> 586.48]  The first of which is regarding Mexico Mission
[586.48 --> 592.62]  So currently, our church has a group of young people and leaders in Mexico
[592.62 --> 595.94]  Serving in East TJ and Rosarito
[595.94 --> 600.56]  They come back on Tuesday and we need people to pick them up
[600.56 --> 606.68]  And so we have rides home for 14 of the 22 currently
[606.68 --> 615.82]  And so we need another vehicle or probably two to go down on Tuesday with us as we pick them up
[615.82 --> 619.18]  And so if you're able to do that, please just grab me after service
[619.18 --> 621.50]  So we can get that coordinated
[621.50 --> 623.62]  And get going
[623.62 --> 627.44]  They have to be picked up at 5 p.m. from Seattle SeaTac
[627.44 --> 628.70]  Now
[628.70 --> 633.04]  Here's something to encourage you to do that
[633.04 --> 637.20]  We got a message yesterday from Brandon who's leading the team there
[637.20 --> 642.00]  They hosted a reactivate style conference
[642.00 --> 643.30]  Yesterday
[643.30 --> 647.14]  And so reactivate is a conference that we host here for youth
[647.14 --> 649.84]  We have about 200 youth and leaders who come
[649.84 --> 658.56]  They hosted the first ever reactivate style conference at pastor abelino's church in the slums of east TJ
[658.56 --> 663.58]  And they had over 150 youth and participants show up to that event
[663.58 --> 666.32]  Which is absolutely amazing
[666.32 --> 673.90]  And so you can imagine the stories that the youth in the team is going to tell on the way home
[673.90 --> 678.96]  So you get to hear those firsthand and right away as you drive them back
[678.96 --> 681.96]  Which is one of the unique privileges of driving and picking them up
[681.96 --> 685.94]  So encourage you to think about whether or not you're able to do that
[685.94 --> 694.50]  And then also pastor kevin has asked that I remind you youth and parents of youth that youth camp
[694.50 --> 698.68]  Registration is out and closes on march 30th
[698.68 --> 700.50]  Which is next week sunday
[700.50 --> 704.78]  And so if you haven't yet registered or registered your child for youth camp
[704.78 --> 707.24]  Please do that this week coming up
[707.24 --> 709.70]  That's it for our announcements this morning
[709.70 --> 712.08]  So i'm going to invite you as you are able and where you are
[712.08 --> 717.06]  You might stand together as we enter into the presence of god in worship
[717.06 --> 729.42]  I invite you to receive god's greeting his welcome into this sacred space of worship together
[729.42 --> 731.18]  Receive the greeting of our god
[731.18 --> 732.72]  Grace
[732.72 --> 734.12]  Mercy
[734.12 --> 742.12]  And peace to you from god our father from the lord jesus christ his son and our savior through the presence and power of the holy spirit
[742.12 --> 743.48]  Amen
[759.42 --> 789.40]  Psalm 89 verses 1 to 3
[789.40 --> 789.86]  He says
[789.86 --> 792.66]  I will sing of the lord's great love forever
[792.66 --> 794.36]  With my mouth
[794.36 --> 797.70]  I will make your faithfulness known through all generations
[797.70 --> 800.86]  I will declare that your love stands firm forever
[800.86 --> 804.90]  That you have established your faithfulness in heaven itself
[804.90 --> 809.20]  So why don't we join our voices and just celebrate god's love and faithfulness this morning
[809.20 --> 827.74]  Come all ye weary come all ye thirsty come to the well that never runs dry drink of the one that never runs dry
[827.74 --> 843.32]  Come all you weary, come all you thirsty, come to the well that never runs right. Drink of the water, come and thirst no more.
[843.32 --> 862.32]  Come all you sinners, come find His mercy, come to the table, He will satisfy. Taste of His goodness, find what you're looking for.
[862.32 --> 878.58]  For God so loved the world that He gave us, His one and only Son to save us. Whoever believes in Him will live forever.
[878.58 --> 897.84]  Bring all your failures, bring your addictions, come lay them down at the foot of the cross. Jesus is waiting there with open arms.
[897.84 --> 913.84]  For God so loved the world that He gave us, His one and only Son to save us. Whoever believes in Him will live forever.
[913.84 --> 932.84]  The power of hell forever defeated, how it is well. I'm walking in freedom for God so loved, God so loved the world.
[932.84 --> 952.16]  Praise God, praise God, praise God, from whom all blessings flow. Praise Him, praise Him, for the wonders of His love.
[952.16 --> 971.48]  Praise God, praise God, praise God, from whom all blessings flow. Praise Him, praise Him, for the wonders of His love.
[971.48 --> 1001.46]  Praise God, praise Him, for the wonders of His love.
[1001.48 --> 1031.46]  Praise God, praise Him, for the wonders of His love.
[1031.58 --> 1035.84]  Praise God, praise Him, for God.
[1036.48 --> 1041.42] OFF
[1061.48 --> 1072.42]  You unravel me with a melody
[1072.42 --> 1079.08]  You surround me with a song
[1079.08 --> 1086.20]  Of deliverance from my enemies
[1086.20 --> 1092.52]  Till all my fears are gone
[1092.52 --> 1099.20]  I'm no longer a slave to fear
[1099.20 --> 1105.88]  I am a child of God
[1105.88 --> 1112.92]  I'm no longer a slave to fear
[1112.92 --> 1119.24]  I am a child of God
[1119.24 --> 1132.56]  From my mother's womb
[1132.56 --> 1136.24]  You have chosen me
[1136.24 --> 1141.94]  Love has called my name
[1141.94 --> 1145.78]  I've been born again
[1145.78 --> 1148.48]  Into your family
[1148.48 --> 1155.06]  Your blood rose through my veins
[1155.06 --> 1161.38]  I'm no longer a slave to fear
[1161.38 --> 1168.02]  I am a child of God
[1168.02 --> 1174.52]  I'm no longer a slave to fear
[1174.52 --> 1180.84]  I am a child of God
[1180.84 --> 1187.42]  I'm no longer a slave to fear
[1187.42 --> 1193.84]  I am a child of God
[1193.84 --> 1207.16]  I am a child of God
[1207.16 --> 1224.56]  You split the sea so I could walk right through it
[1224.56 --> 1228.48]  My fears were drowned in perfect love
[1228.48 --> 1236.80]  You rescued me so I could walk right through it
[1236.80 --> 1241.80]  I am a child of God
[1241.80 --> 1249.68]  You split the sea so I could walk right through it
[1249.68 --> 1256.00]  My fears were drowned in perfect love
[1256.00 --> 1261.50]  You rescued me so I could stand and sing
[1261.50 --> 1267.00]  I am a child of God
[1267.00 --> 1272.32]  I am a child of God
[1272.32 --> 1275.32]  I am a child of God
[1275.32 --> 1279.82]  I am a child of God
[1279.82 --> 1282.32]  I am a child of God
[1282.32 --> 1288.72]  I'm no longer a slave to fear
[1288.72 --> 1295.04]  I am a child of God
[1295.04 --> 1297.04]  I am a child of God
[1297.04 --> 1302.10]  I'm no longer a slave to fear
[1302.10 --> 1308.04]  I am a child of God
[1308.04 --> 1312.38]  I invite you to be seated
[1312.38 --> 1322.44]  Last week I walked into the lobby
[1322.44 --> 1325.56]  And I was reading the verse that's on the wall there
[1325.56 --> 1327.46]  Matthew 11, 28-29
[1327.46 --> 1330.10]  It just got me thinking a little bit
[1330.10 --> 1331.78]  It says,
[1331.88 --> 1334.04]  Come to me, all who are weary and burdened
[1334.04 --> 1335.10]  And I will give you rest
[1335.10 --> 1337.88]  Take my yoke upon you and learn from me
[1337.88 --> 1340.62]  For I am quiet and humble in heart
[1340.62 --> 1344.12]  And you will find rest for your souls
[1344.12 --> 1349.96]  I just find that we can be so distracted by our own failures
[1349.96 --> 1352.64]  Distracted by even cultural values
[1352.64 --> 1354.12]  Life pressures
[1354.12 --> 1356.84]  Mouth is dry
[1356.84 --> 1359.12]  Life pressures
[1359.12 --> 1362.84]  If we're honest with each other and ourselves
[1362.84 --> 1364.64]  There's a long list of distractions
[1364.64 --> 1369.10]  We can hardly hear the voice of Jesus offering us rest
[1369.10 --> 1371.82]  So I thought this Lent season is a good time
[1371.82 --> 1373.40]  To take him at his offer
[1373.40 --> 1377.44]  To take his yoke upon us
[1377.44 --> 1380.48]  And to rest in the victory he has won
[1380.48 --> 1383.02]  And to live in his love
[1383.02 --> 1386.48]  So let his gentle, humble heart
[1386.48 --> 1389.94]  Draw us into a life filled with his love
[1389.94 --> 1392.30]  Let's bow our heads
[1392.30 --> 1398.32]  Father, will you by your spirit quiet our hearts
[1398.32 --> 1401.86]  So we can hear your invitation to rest in you
[1401.86 --> 1405.90]  Forgive us for allowing
[1405.90 --> 1408.36]  The concerns of this life
[1408.36 --> 1409.80]  To drown out your voice
[1409.80 --> 1412.40]  In this Lent season
[1412.40 --> 1415.34]  Help us to reflect on your sacrifice
[1415.34 --> 1418.12]  Your love poured out for us
[1418.12 --> 1422.36]  Quiet us and enfold us in your love
[1422.36 --> 1425.40]  We need you every hour
[1425.40 --> 1426.42]  Amen
[1426.42 --> 1430.60]  Why don't we stand and continue worship
[1435.90 --> 1444.76]  Thank you
[1458.72 --> 1461.46]  Thank you
[1461.46 --> 1465.56]  Michael
[1465.56 --> 1482.28]  I need Thee every hour, most gracious Lord, no tender voice like Thy can peace afford.
[1482.28 --> 1499.10]  I need Thee, O I need Thee, every hour I need Thee, O bless me now, my Savior, I come to Thee.
[1499.10 --> 1516.52]  I need Thee every hour, stay Thou nearby, temptations lose their power when Thou art gone.
[1516.52 --> 1533.28]  I need Thee, O I need Thee, every hour I need Thee, O bless me now, my Savior, I come to Thee.
[1533.28 --> 1552.26]  I need Thee every hour, enjoy your pain, come quickly and abide, for life is vain.
[1552.26 --> 1570.26]  I need Thee, O I need Thee, every hour I need Thee, O bless me now, my Savior, I come to Thee.
[1570.26 --> 1588.26]  I need Thee every hour, most holy one, O make me Thine indeed, Thou blessed Son.
[1588.26 --> 1605.26]  I need Thee every hour, most holy one, my Savior, I come to Thee.
[1618.26 --> 1648.24]  I need Thee every hour, most holy one, my Savior, I come to Thee, O bless me now, my Savior, I come to Thee.
[1648.24 --> 1678.22]  I need Thee every hour, most holy one, my Savior, I come to Thee, O bless me now, my Savior, I come to Thee.
[1678.24 --> 1689.24]  Sing a new song, sing a new song, to hear new sin song, Heaven's mercy sing.
[1689.24 --> 1703.02]  Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come.
[1703.02 --> 1719.02]  With all creation I sing, praise to the King of kings, you are my everything, and I will adore you.
[1719.02 --> 1742.02]  Golden rainbows, a living color, flashes of lightning, rolls of thunder.
[1742.02 --> 1744.02]  Golden rainbows, a living color, heavy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come.
[1744.02 --> 1746.02]  Golden rainbows, a living color, most holy is the Lord God Almighty, who is and is and is to come.
[1746.02 --> 1749.06]  in honor strength and glory
[1749.06 --> 1750.10]  glory
[1750.10 --> 1754.98]  to you the only wise
[1754.98 --> 1757.06]  king
[1757.06 --> 1761.06]  holy holy holy
[1761.06 --> 1763.86]  is the lord god almighty
[1763.86 --> 1769.06]  who was and is and is to come
[1769.06 --> 1773.22]  with all creation
[1773.22 --> 1777.22]  i sing praise to the king of me
[1777.22 --> 1781.22]  you are my everything
[1781.22 --> 1787.22]  and i will adore you
[1797.22 --> 1801.22]  filled with wonder
[1801.22 --> 1805.22]  all struck wonder
[1805.22 --> 1809.22]  at the mention of your name
[1809.22 --> 1813.22]  filled with wonder
[1813.22 --> 1817.22]  all struck wonder
[1817.22 --> 1825.22]  at the mention of your name
[1825.22 --> 1827.22]  filled with wonder
[1827.22 --> 1831.22]  all struck wonder
[1831.22 --> 1841.22]  and the mention of your name
[1841.22 --> 1843.22]  breath of
[1843.22 --> 1845.22]  breath of living water
[1845.22 --> 1848.44]  Such a marvelous mystery.
[1851.84 --> 1861.90]  Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come.
[1864.34 --> 1870.66]  With all creation I sing praise to the King of kings.
[1870.66 --> 1877.36]  You are my everything and I will adore you.
[1878.26 --> 1887.88]  Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come.
[1890.88 --> 1896.56]  With all creation I sing praise to the King of kings.
[1896.56 --> 1904.26]  You are my everything and I will adore you.
[1904.26 --> 1915.66]  I invite you to be seated.
[1915.66 --> 1916.66]  Amen.
[1916.66 --> 1917.66]  Amen.
[1917.66 --> 1919.66]  Amen.
[1922.10 --> 1931.84]  This morning in our worship together we have the blessed opportunity to welcome a new member into our church fellowship.
[1932.26 --> 1938.26]  This morning we're going to welcome Aidan Eyre into our church family.
[1938.44 --> 1941.66]  Aidan has been worshiping with us for some time now.
[1941.66 --> 1945.44]  He's a master's student at Trinity Western University.
[1945.98 --> 1949.80]  He's working with the Canada Institute of Linguistics.
[1950.78 --> 1953.46]  He's originally from Calgary where he still has family.
[1954.02 --> 1959.86]  And in fact he's going to share a little bit with us later what he's up to and what God is calling him to.
[1960.00 --> 1965.10]  Because it's a neat opportunity I think for us to encourage him and support him in that work too.
[1965.10 --> 1972.30]  But to do that Aidan I want to invite you to the front as we welcome you into the fellowship of this church.
[1972.40 --> 1975.18]  We're going to do so with a couple questions where you can reaffirm your faith.
[1975.28 --> 1977.02]  Just come up here and then you can have a microphone.
[1980.94 --> 1987.90]  So this morning we're going to ask that you reaffirm your faith and your commitment to God's mission in and through Langley Emanuel.
[1988.08 --> 1993.82]  Us here to our city, to our region, and to the world through what God is doing in our midst.
[1993.82 --> 1999.56]  So I'm going to ask you three questions and I'm going to invite you to respond by saying adieu with God's help.
[2002.94 --> 2010.92]  As we welcome you into this church family we ask you to affirm your faith that you have professed and your commitment to God's mission among us.
[2011.48 --> 2017.92]  And so do you believe in Jesus as your Savior and Lord and that in him alone is hope and freedom from sin found?
[2017.92 --> 2026.92]  Do you believe that the Bible is the word of God revealing his plan for redemption in Jesus Christ and the preaching and teaching of Langley Emanuel reflect this truth?
[2026.92 --> 2035.68]  And do you promise with the help of the Holy Spirit to do all you can to strengthen your relationship to Jesus by being a part of the life of this church,
[2035.84 --> 2044.10]  recognizing its oversight and authority, and joining with us on mission for Jesus in this community, this city, and to the world?
[2044.58 --> 2045.74]  Aidan, what is your answer?
[2046.38 --> 2047.72]  I do with God's help.
[2047.86 --> 2048.12]  Amen.
[2048.12 --> 2048.24]  Amen.
[2048.80 --> 2051.38]  Let's welcome Aidan to our church family together.
[2058.02 --> 2063.08]  Because what Aidan is up to at Trinity, I think, is really cool,
[2063.50 --> 2068.76]  I've asked if he would share a little bit about his story and what brought him to this place and what he sees God doing.
[2069.14 --> 2070.94]  So we're going to hear from Aidan at this point.
[2071.18 --> 2074.68]  After which, I'm going to invite an elder to come up, so don't run away at the end.
[2074.88 --> 2075.20]  Go ahead.
[2075.20 --> 2076.64]  All right.
[2076.86 --> 2077.58]  Hey, everyone.
[2077.80 --> 2079.20]  I am Aidan Eyre.
[2079.72 --> 2086.66]  I'm from Calgary, and I'm currently taking a master's program in linguistics and translation at Trinity Western University,
[2087.34 --> 2090.64]  hoping to join in the ministry of Bible translation.
[2091.48 --> 2095.62]  My parents have both been with Wycliffe Bible Translators since before I was born.
[2096.30 --> 2102.46]  And so, I mean, they never actually worked overseas, but they did sort of administrative roles here in North America.
[2102.46 --> 2110.32]  And so I kind of grew up in that whole world, knowing about Bible translation, hearing stories around the world.
[2110.62 --> 2117.80]  But it wasn't really until halfway through my undergraduate degree that he started to give me my own strong calling for it.
[2117.80 --> 2125.90]  I got the chance to attend a summer program out at CanIL, the Canada Institute of Linguistics, which is at Trinity Western.
[2125.90 --> 2131.08]  And just seeing people's passion and hearing the stories of God's work all around the world.
[2131.64 --> 2136.50]  It's just so inspiring and just really cut through to my heart.
[2136.50 --> 2143.72]  And so, yeah, I decided to start my own master's program in June of 2023.
[2144.02 --> 2147.62]  So I'm just about two years in with one year left to go.
[2147.70 --> 2149.94]  And after that, I intend to join Wycliffe myself.
[2149.94 --> 2158.70]  And I'm just so glad that God's brought me where he has because he's surrounded me with some of the most amazing godly people that I've ever met.
[2158.90 --> 2163.42]  And they've just blessed me in so many ways with their depth of character and Bible knowledge.
[2163.62 --> 2165.14]  It just astounds me.
[2165.26 --> 2167.48]  And it's just taught me so much.
[2167.48 --> 2183.24]  And he's also given me an intense compassion for minority language groups because these are often people who have kind of been forgotten, cast out, ostracized, even looked down upon by other members of society.
[2184.08 --> 2195.64]  The government doesn't recognize them in most cases as having official status, even though they've usually been there for generations and generations before the larger languages have.
[2195.64 --> 2209.56]  But it forces them to have to learn these larger languages that have come in in order to communicate with other towns, but also often to be able to take in God's word.
[2210.08 --> 2217.10]  They have to learn a separate language aside from their heart language in order to be able to intake God's word and his message to them.
[2217.10 --> 2228.96]  And that just is sad to me because it kind of acts as an additional barrier for God to be able to effectively communicate to them and really speak into their hearts.
[2229.74 --> 2241.16]  And so I just want to help work in Bible translation and help deliver God's word to them in the language that they know best and that speaks to them emotionally.
[2241.16 --> 2245.12]  And there's just so much work that needs to be done.
[2245.74 --> 2254.24]  There's about 7,000 languages in the world and only a little over 10% of those actually have a full Bible, which is such a small number.
[2254.24 --> 2259.20]  I've started to feel God specifically calling me to Africa.
[2259.96 --> 2267.20]  And so in order to help prepare me for that, he's actually given me an amazing opportunity to spend three months in Africa this summer.
[2267.92 --> 2279.24]  And so I'll be going with a Wycliffe team in May to visit language communities in South Africa and Namibia, just kind of seeing parts of the translation process and helping get involved in scripture engagement activities.
[2279.24 --> 2297.46]  And then I'll get to spend June and July helping teach a linguistics class at a training school in Nairobi, Kenya, with the focus of helping train local translators from all across the continent of Africa in order to better equip them with the linguistic skills that will help in their translation efforts.
[2297.46 --> 2298.46]  Yeah.
[2300.46 --> 2315.08]  And so I just can't wait for the chance to see God's word in action in those tangible ways, transforming lives, but also to see the transformation that he'll inevitably be taking me through, both through this trip this summer, but also through the crazy life that he's calling me into.
[2316.36 --> 2316.70]  Yeah.
[2316.88 --> 2317.70]  So thank you.
[2318.06 --> 2322.92]  I'm so excited to join this community over the next year and beyond.
[2324.30 --> 2325.18]  Thanks for that.
[2327.46 --> 2328.42]  Eric up to the front.
[2328.56 --> 2332.62]  Eric is one of the pastoral elders here in our church community.
[2333.18 --> 2339.80]  He's not the pastoral elder of the district that we have put you in because it's spring break and that pastoral elder isn't here.
[2340.32 --> 2342.92]  But the one you're in is about the same height as Eric.
[2343.54 --> 2345.76]  So you should be able to see him in a crowd.
[2345.86 --> 2348.72]  I'll make sure Seth reaches out to you this week.
[2349.20 --> 2353.08]  We're going to take a moment and just pray for Aidan and for God's call on his life.
[2353.08 --> 2356.58]  So I invite you to join your heart with us in prayer together.
[2357.46 --> 2364.58]  God, we thank you for the testimony of your faithfulness that Aidan shared with us just now.
[2365.12 --> 2371.14]  We thank you for the calling that you've placed on his life and for the process of discernment that he is now in,
[2371.56 --> 2378.68]  even as he grows in his skills and capacities, even as he exercises his response to your call.
[2378.68 --> 2391.02]  We pray, Lord, for clarity of heart and mind as he listens to the voice of the Holy Spirit and discerns more precisely where it is you are calling him to go with your word.
[2391.40 --> 2401.08]  And how it is that you are calling him to bring that word to unreached places, unreached people groups, and un-yet-translated languages.
[2401.08 --> 2405.66]  God, you are so good and your word is so powerful.
[2405.66 --> 2416.38]  And we thank you for people like Aidan who commit themselves and their lives to serving you by bringing your word into places it has not yet gone.
[2416.90 --> 2422.00]  And so we pray, Lord God, accomplish your purpose in him and through him.
[2422.00 --> 2431.90]  And may he be blessed as he joins our fellowship and may we, together as the body of Christ, be blessed for having him among us.
[2432.40 --> 2434.82]  We pray this, Jesus, in your most holy name.
[2435.44 --> 2435.70]  Amen.
[2437.00 --> 2437.32]  Amen.
[2438.20 --> 2438.70]  Thanks, Aidan.
[2439.34 --> 2441.78]  We're going to continue our worship with the offering,
[2442.04 --> 2445.62]  so I'm going to invite the deacon to come forward and explain what our offering this morning is.
[2452.00 --> 2460.26]  Good morning, everyone.
[2460.50 --> 2465.90]  Welcome, Aidan, and thank you for your global perspective this morning.
[2467.18 --> 2472.18]  The offering, my name is Allison, first of all, and I'm a deacon here at the church.
[2472.84 --> 2480.86]  The offerings, we are supporting this morning, first of all, the budget for the workings of the church here.
[2480.86 --> 2484.82]  The other one is also kind of global.
[2486.38 --> 2488.46]  It's a ministry to seafarers.
[2489.24 --> 2493.14]  There are two locations, one in Vancouver, one in Tawasson.
[2494.14 --> 2501.66]  And the volunteers there go visit the seafarers on the ships up to 40 roughly a month.
[2502.00 --> 2508.12]  That's a huge number of people from all over the world, and they come to our harbors.
[2508.12 --> 2514.02]  And the volunteers of the ministry to seafarers help them.
[2514.28 --> 2515.42]  They take them to appointments.
[2515.80 --> 2524.12]  They have safe places for the seafarers to go to contact their families that they're separated from for months,
[2524.92 --> 2526.54]  sometimes years at a time.
[2526.54 --> 2531.60]  So that's what we're supporting this morning.
[2532.12 --> 2533.98]  And there are multiple ways.
[2534.44 --> 2535.22]  Check your bulletin.
[2535.32 --> 2538.66]  Check the website for ways to give to both those.
[2539.66 --> 2540.16]  Thank you.
[2540.16 --> 2543.30]  Thank you.
[2547.70 --> 2569.70]  Thank you.
[2569.70 --> 2583.70]  Your faithfulness stretches to the sky.
[2583.70 --> 2593.70]  Your righteousness is what reminds mountains.
[2593.70 --> 2602.70]  Your justice flows like the ocean top.
[2602.70 --> 2612.70]  And I will lift my arms to worship you, my being.
[2612.70 --> 2623.70]  I will find my strength in the shadow of your wings.
[2623.70 --> 2633.70]  Your love, O Lord, reaches to the heavens.
[2633.70 --> 2643.70]  Your faithfulness stretches to the sky.
[2643.70 --> 2652.70]  Your righteousness is what reminds mountains.
[2652.70 --> 2661.70]  Your justice flows like the ocean top.
[2661.70 --> 2671.70]  I will lift my voice to worship you, my being.
[2671.70 --> 2680.70]  I will find my strength in the shadow of your wings.
[2680.70 --> 2681.70]  Your love, O Lord, reaches to the heavens.
[2681.70 --> 2682.70]  Your love, O Lord, reaches to the heavens.
[2682.70 --> 2683.70]  Your faithfulness is what makes me.
[2683.70 --> 2689.70]  I will lift my voice to worship you, my being.
[2689.70 --> 2690.70]  I will lift my voice to worship you, my being.
[2690.70 --> 2691.70]  Your love, O Lord, reaches to the heavens.
[2691.70 --> 2692.70]  Your faithfulness stretches to the sky.
[2692.70 --> 2693.70]  I will lift my voice to worship you, my being.
[2693.70 --> 2694.70]  Your faithfulness is what makes me.
[2694.70 --> 2695.70]  Your faithfulness is what makes me.
[2695.70 --> 2696.70]  Your faithfulness is what makes me.
[2696.70 --> 2697.70]  Your faithfulness is what makes me.
[2697.70 --> 2702.70]  Thank you, my God.
[2702.70 --> 2703.70]  Amen!
[2703.70 --> 2707.70]  Your faithfulness is what makes me.
[2707.72 --> 2721.70]  Amen!
[2727.70 --> 2736.70]  Good morning everybody. Can I have the preschool to grade four come up to the front?
[2736.70 --> 2752.70]  You were a rocket ship, yeah. What kind of weather do we have outside today? Rainy. I found it kind of ironic as I was driving here.
[2752.70 --> 2759.70]  It was pouring rain. You could barely see. And our story today is Jesus calms the storm.
[2759.70 --> 2771.70]  So what do you think when it's craziness outside, how do we feel? Wet, but like how do we feel inside?
[2771.70 --> 2778.70]  Are we worried? Are we scared? What if it's thunder and lightning coming down?
[2778.70 --> 2783.70]  Sometimes we're scared, yeah. Mateo, what do you think?
[2791.70 --> 2796.70]  You wonder how it's going to calm the storm and Jesus is going to help us? Yeah, definitely.
[2796.70 --> 2803.70]  What do you think when there's a snowstorm outside? We go inside, definitely.
[2803.70 --> 2812.70]  But today we're going to learn when it's stormy, so whether it's raining, whether it's too hot, that can be kind of a storm, a dust storm,
[2812.70 --> 2824.70]  snow storm, that Jesus is always there and he reminds us to be still and calm and listen and he will help us through it.
[2824.70 --> 2828.70]  We're going to go more about that in children's worship time, so I'm going to get you guys to stand up.
[2828.70 --> 2838.70]  Stand up. Yeah. And everybody look, turn around. Ready? One, two, three.
[2838.70 --> 2840.70]  We'll be with you.
[2840.70 --> 2842.70]  We'll be with you.
[2858.70 --> 2874.70]  We'll be with you.
[2875.70 --> 2881.70]  Always great to be in God's church with his people.
[2881.70 --> 2890.70]  Welcome, Aidan. And I'm going to get in trouble for this, but Lena, it's awesome to see you back. Praise God.
[2892.70 --> 2898.70]  My first duty is to read a letter from Council, a short letter about nominations.
[2898.70 --> 2904.70]  Council is calling for nominations of people to serve as elders and deacons in our church.
[2904.70 --> 2909.70]  This season we are looking for pastoral elders and for deacons.
[2909.70 --> 2915.70]  Pastoral elders serve the church by providing shepherding care and theological discernment.
[2915.70 --> 2925.70]  Working closely with our pastors, deacons serve the church by providing material care and service discernment in our church family and community.
[2925.70 --> 2932.70]  Both of these positions call for people mature in faith who share the mission and vision of our church.
[2932.70 --> 2939.70]  Please prayerfully discern who the Holy Spirit may be calling to serve our church in this way.
[2939.70 --> 2950.70]  Nomination forms are available at the church office beside the confidential mailbox and will be in the e-bulletin and the mid-week memo after spring break.
[2950.70 --> 2957.70]  If you have any questions, please talk to any of the elders and deacons or church pastors.
[2957.70 --> 2969.70]  This morning we want to remember the people who are challenged. I'll call them challenged. We're all challenged, I think.
[2969.70 --> 2977.70]  But I want to focus on Tara Porter. She's asking for prayer for her husband and for her brother-in-law.
[2977.70 --> 2991.70]  We've prayed Sunday after Sunday for Tessa, for Tanya, for Doug Kandon, and a host of others who are dealing with stuff we may not know about, but God certainly does.
[2991.70 --> 2999.70]  And then we also want to thank the shut-ins. We have members that can't physically join us, but would probably love to.
[2999.70 --> 3006.70]  And then it's time to go to God in prayer. So let's pray.
[3006.70 --> 3018.70]  Father, Lord in heaven, Lord, thank you. Thank you that we can be here. Thank you that we can live amongst your people.
[3018.70 --> 3035.70]  Lord, we pray for the people we just spoke about, each one who's going through stuff that we'd rather not, but we pray we bless each person as they deal with their treatments or sicknesses or whatever it is, Lord.
[3035.70 --> 3042.70]  Lord, we want to ask you to bless the nomination process.
[3042.70 --> 3054.70]  Lord, if we look at Scripture and study about Jesus, and the day before he picked his disciples, he spent the whole evening in prayer.
[3054.70 --> 3059.70]  Lord, and we would think that he wouldn't have to do this, but because he was your son.
[3059.70 --> 3064.70]  Lord, and how many of us, Lord, spend even half the night in prayer?
[3064.70 --> 3069.70]  Lord, will you convict us for things we could do better?
[3069.70 --> 3074.70]  Time we spent in your word, time we spend in prayer.
[3074.70 --> 3081.70]  Lord, who else calls us to share time with you?
[3081.70 --> 3086.70]  Lord, it is only because of you that we are even here.
[3086.70 --> 3090.70]  It is only because of you that each of us has another day.
[3090.70 --> 3094.70]  Lord, we pray for the young among us. We pray for wisdom.
[3094.70 --> 3100.70]  We pray for the teachers who teach them. We pray for the parents, the moms and the dads.
[3100.70 --> 3106.70]  Lord, and then when school is done, work starts, or maybe even before.
[3106.70 --> 3114.70]  We pray for the jobs each of us has, whatever it is, Lord, if it's in the home or outside the home, or whatever you've called us to do.
[3114.70 --> 3118.70]  Lord, we pray will you help us to focus on you while we're doing this.
[3118.70 --> 3126.70]  Lord, if there's a word we can share with somebody that we work with, we pray will you give us the opportunity and the wisdom,
[3126.70 --> 3132.70]  and not a cutting or challenging, but a loving and caring word.
[3132.70 --> 3141.70]  Lord, we pray this morning as we hear your word that Chris may be enlightened, that it may be a word from you, Lord.
[3141.70 --> 3145.70]  We thank you for your many blessings, Lord. We pray will you help and guide us.
[3145.70 --> 3150.70]  We pray also for the people who are going for surgery this week, Lord.
[3150.70 --> 3156.70]  We pray will you give them strength, give the doctors wisdom, and the nurses insight.
[3156.70 --> 3161.70]  Thank you for your love and care, Lord. Thank you that we can be here in Jesus' name. Amen.
[3162.70 --> 3191.70]  Here at Emmanuel, we have been in a preaching series through the letters of the Thessalonians, of the Apostle Paul to the church in Thessalonica.
[3191.70 --> 3200.70]  This morning, we continue that, and we're going to read the four verses from chapter 5, verses 12 through 15.
[3200.70 --> 3207.70]  I'm going to invite you to have a Bible, either on your apps, on your devices and phones, or one that you brought.
[3207.70 --> 3209.70]  Or if you'd like, there's some at the back you can grab.
[3209.70 --> 3214.70]  Have that open. Keep that open. We'll refer back to that intentionally throughout.
[3214.70 --> 3219.70]  The first time through, it will be on the screen behind me there for you.
[3219.70 --> 3231.70]  Now, before I read this text, I want you to know that I really struggled this week in how to do this, and how to preach on this text.
[3231.70 --> 3236.70]  For reasons I hope will become clear once we start reading it together.
[3236.70 --> 3244.70]  But let me just say that this is one of the reasons, texts like these, is one of the reasons why I like to preach in series,
[3244.70 --> 3248.70]  where we start at the beginning of the book of the Bible and we go through to the end of it,
[3248.70 --> 3253.70]  because it forces me to preach on topics that I might otherwise avoid.
[3253.70 --> 3266.70]  And the reason I'm saying that is because the first half of this text that we are about to read is Paul telling the church how they're supposed to acknowledge and treat their leaders.
[3266.70 --> 3274.70]  And so I don't want it to appear for me to stand up here and then tell you how you're supposed to pander to me.
[3274.70 --> 3280.70]  And so I really, really wrestled with this text that I'm inviting you into that wrestling.
[3280.70 --> 3289.70]  And one of the things that I did as I prepared for this was to make sure and search my own heart and life
[3289.70 --> 3298.70]  to see if this kind of recognition of good leadership in the church is something that I strive for,
[3298.70 --> 3307.70]  is the posture that I try to have in my leading and that I try to present to you so that, Lord willing, you can see it.
[3307.70 --> 3312.70]  And then if you choose to acknowledge it, great.
[3312.70 --> 3324.70]  It is also amazing to me that as we are about to spend a good portion of our time talking about what makes good leaders in the church
[3324.70 --> 3332.70]  and how we acknowledge good leaders, it happens to providentially fall on the Sunday that we also announce nominations for new leaders.
[3332.70 --> 3342.70]  And so as you hear these descriptions, may the Holy Spirit press on your heart who God might be calling to serve this church in this way.
[3342.70 --> 3356.70]  And so I please, I beg your patience and I hope you see my humility, but also my unwillingness to compromise the word of God.
[3356.70 --> 3361.70]  And to call you to the things that God calls us to.
[3361.70 --> 3372.70]  And so if you have a problem with what I say this morning, please wait till Tuesday of next week, like the week after next, because I'm off this next week.
[3372.70 --> 3377.70]  Or talk to Paul as the chair of council.
[3377.70 --> 3396.70]  Secondly, by way of introduction and before we read this text, I do want to remind us that the kinds of things that we are being called to here in the word of God is a calling for people who are Christians.
[3396.70 --> 3397.70]  Right?
[3397.70 --> 3398.70]  Right?
[3398.70 --> 3413.70]  And this is a specific reality that those who have received the gospel of grace by faith, who have been, as a result of that, made into a new creation, are now challenged by God to live in line with this new creation.
[3413.70 --> 3414.70]  Right?
[3414.70 --> 3422.70]  And so because Jesus has already lived the life I should have lived, because Jesus has already died the death that I deserve because of my sin,
[3422.70 --> 3428.70]  because the truth of the matter is I'm more sinful than I would ever dare admit.
[3428.70 --> 3432.70]  Yet I'm more loved by God than I could ever imagine possible.
[3432.70 --> 3441.70]  And out of that deep love for us, that God has made us into a new creation by believing in the truth of this word.
[3441.70 --> 3445.70]  We are made a new people who live new lives together.
[3445.70 --> 3453.70]  And so the foundation of this text is the gospel and our new identity as Christians.
[3453.70 --> 3458.70]  And this then is how we are called to lead and to live.
[3458.70 --> 3464.70]  So with those two words of introduction, let's read this text together.
[3464.70 --> 3469.70]  1 Thessalonians 5, starting at verse 12.
[3469.70 --> 3479.70]  Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, to acknowledge those who work hard among you, who care for you in the Lord and who admonish you.
[3479.70 --> 3484.70]  Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work.
[3484.70 --> 3487.70]  Live in peace with each other.
[3487.70 --> 3494.70]  And we urge you, brothers and sisters, warn those who are idle and disruptive.
[3494.70 --> 3496.70]  Encourage the disheartened.
[3496.70 --> 3497.70]  Help the weak.
[3497.70 --> 3499.70]  Be patient with everyone.
[3499.70 --> 3502.70]  Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong,
[3502.70 --> 3508.70]  but always strive to do what is good for each other and for everyone else.
[3508.70 --> 3510.70]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3510.70 --> 3526.70]  The way that I want to frame the text for us this morning is to identify these two sections in these verses as two marks of a healthy church.
[3526.70 --> 3533.70]  So our big idea, right, is that the marks of a healthy church are, one, how leaders are acknowledged.
[3533.70 --> 3537.70]  That is how they are held up, how they are encouraged, respected, and held accountable.
[3537.70 --> 3542.70]  And two, how people look out for each other in the body.
[3542.70 --> 3550.70]  Now, there's a grammatical reason for this division, and I'll give this for Aidan, who can probably get it, and maybe Cole, who follows along as well.
[3550.70 --> 3557.70]  But there's an imperative structure being connected to the vocative voice here that gives you the division where we read in verse 12,
[3557.70 --> 3564.70]  Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, and then later down the line in verse 14,
[3564.70 --> 3567.70]  we urge you, brothers and sisters.
[3567.70 --> 3572.70]  There's two sections, two marks of identifying a healthy church.
[3572.70 --> 3575.70]  So it's pretty easy for us to see.
[3575.70 --> 3581.70]  Those are the divisions we're going to follow in our time together this morning.
[3581.70 --> 3590.70]  And so first, we read that we are to acknowledge those who work hard among you.
[3590.70 --> 3599.70]  The word that's used here and translated acknowledged is related to another Greek word that means to see,
[3599.70 --> 3606.70]  which is itself related to a Hebrew word or concept that means to know.
[3606.70 --> 3615.70]  And so to acknowledge someone in the biblical sense here is to really see them and to really know them.
[3615.70 --> 3621.70]  To be seen and known in the Bible is to look on someone with favor.
[3621.70 --> 3623.70]  And it's more than just saying thank you.
[3623.70 --> 3626.70]  It's more than just saying good job.
[3626.70 --> 3629.70]  It's a genuine appreciation.
[3629.70 --> 3631.70]  Let me illustrate.
[3631.70 --> 3639.70]  Maybe you're a student and perhaps this is true for a senior, high school senior project or paper that you had to write.
[3639.70 --> 3643.70]  You poured yourself into that paper in doing that project.
[3643.70 --> 3650.70]  And not only did you get a good grade on it, but when the teacher was handing those back out,
[3650.70 --> 3655.70]  they made a point to draw everyone else's attention to how standout your work was.
[3655.70 --> 3659.70]  That's the kind of appreciation we're talking about here.
[3659.70 --> 3669.70]  Maybe you have started a job for the first time and you remember the first time your new supervisor pointed out your good work and how that made you feel.
[3669.70 --> 3672.70]  That's what we're talking about here when we talk about being acknowledged.
[3672.70 --> 3673.70]  Right?
[3673.70 --> 3677.70]  A genuine knowing and being known.
[3677.70 --> 3680.70]  Seeing and being seen.
[3680.70 --> 3683.70]  And that's your job.
[3683.70 --> 3688.70]  To see and know your leaders.
[3688.70 --> 3691.70]  Which naturally then moves us to ask the following question.
[3691.70 --> 3695.70]  What are the kinds of things we should acknowledge around here?
[3695.70 --> 3696.70]  Right?
[3696.70 --> 3700.70]  What are the things we're supposed to see and know about our leaders?
[3700.70 --> 3703.70]  Our text lists three of them.
[3704.70 --> 3710.70]  Lists those who work hard among you, those who care for you, and those who admonish you.
[3710.70 --> 3712.70]  And so let's dig into this a little bit.
[3712.70 --> 3717.70]  First, acknowledge those who work hard among you.
[3717.70 --> 3726.70]  The word that's used for work hard among you means to be spent with labor.
[3726.70 --> 3729.70]  Jesus actually uses the same word.
[3729.70 --> 3731.70]  And it was a beautiful thing.
[3731.70 --> 3736.70]  Pete in our worship referenced this text from Matthew 11, these words of Jesus.
[3736.70 --> 3737.70]  When Jesus says,
[3737.70 --> 3741.70]  Come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden.
[3741.70 --> 3745.70]  That word weary is the same word that Paul uses in our text here.
[3747.70 --> 3748.70]  Right?
[3748.70 --> 3754.70]  That word, all who are weary, is the same word that Paul says, those who work hard among you.
[3755.70 --> 3758.70]  The point is, good leaders work hard.
[3759.70 --> 3762.70]  Good leaders are going to be tired at the end of the day.
[3762.70 --> 3765.70]  And if you're a leader in the church, and this will be true of any leader,
[3765.70 --> 3771.70]  but I think that this text is especially talking about church office leaders,
[3771.70 --> 3773.70]  those who are ordained into a particular service.
[3773.70 --> 3776.70]  So elders, deacons, pastors, evangelists.
[3776.70 --> 3777.70]  Right?
[3777.70 --> 3780.70]  This kind of hard work is demanding work.
[3780.70 --> 3784.70]  It's not for the faint of heart, but it is for the soft of heart.
[3784.70 --> 3786.70]  More on that later.
[3786.70 --> 3791.70]  And this isn't just work, and to mix our definitions, this is labor.
[3791.70 --> 3799.70]  Now the joke always is, you know, go be a pastor because you'll only work one day a week.
[3801.70 --> 3802.70]  And that's fine.
[3802.70 --> 3803.70]  If that's what you think.
[3804.70 --> 3808.70]  That probably means I'm doing my job okay, and I'm exercising healthy boundaries,
[3808.70 --> 3810.70]  and I'm not giving in to the culture of busyness around me.
[3810.70 --> 3816.70]  But if we're more realistic about it, it should probably go and be a pastor,
[3816.70 --> 3818.70]  and maybe you'll get one day a week off.
[3818.70 --> 3822.70]  Now, again, don't hear what I'm not saying, okay?
[3822.70 --> 3823.70]  Because I love this.
[3823.70 --> 3825.70]  I love what I get to do.
[3825.70 --> 3829.70]  I love that I get to do it with you and be in the mix of all of this.
[3829.70 --> 3832.70]  But this is what it means to work hard among you.
[3832.70 --> 3839.70]  And when we work hard among you, right, using this word, when we are spent with labor,
[3839.70 --> 3843.70]  we get to hear Jesus say, come to me, all who are weary.
[3843.70 --> 3844.70]  Right?
[3844.70 --> 3849.70]  Laboring among you, I hear that as an invitation to Jesus himself.
[3849.70 --> 3850.70]  Right?
[3850.70 --> 3857.70]  We labor among the body so that we might rest in the body of Jesus as we experience him through one another.
[3857.70 --> 3869.70]  And when you see your pastors and your elders and deacons and church leaders and maybe church staff laboring in this way,
[3869.70 --> 3875.70]  we are inviting you into the rest of Jesus.
[3875.70 --> 3886.70]  And when you see that, you ought to tell them, to acknowledge them, to say, I see you and I'm thankful to God for you.
[3886.70 --> 3887.70]  Right?
[3887.70 --> 3893.70]  To encourage them and to pray for them and to thank God for them, to support them, and yes, to pay them well.
[3893.70 --> 3894.70]  There, I said it.
[3894.70 --> 3895.70]  That's the last time.
[3895.70 --> 3896.70]  Right?
[3896.70 --> 3899.70]  Bless them with surprises.
[3899.70 --> 3900.70]  Right?
[3900.70 --> 3902.70]  Care for those who care for you.
[3902.70 --> 3907.70]  And then if I may, that's my experience of you.
[3907.70 --> 3911.70]  And I know that that is true for the other pastors here.
[3911.70 --> 3914.70]  I pray that it is true for the elders and deacons who serve here.
[3914.70 --> 3921.70]  But as you see this happen among you, acknowledge those.
[3921.70 --> 3925.70]  Acknowledge those who care for you in the Lord.
[3925.70 --> 3927.70]  That's the second part.
[3927.70 --> 3928.70]  Right?
[3928.70 --> 3931.70]  Acknowledge those who care for you in the Lord.
[3931.70 --> 3940.70]  That term, translated care, is actually a particular and perhaps even more technical term.
[3940.70 --> 3952.70]  The form that it's used here as a middle passive participle, again, Aidan, that's for you, means to direct or lead, to govern.
[3952.70 --> 3961.70]  It's the same word, actually, that Paul uses in 1 Timothy 5, 17, about the elders who direct the affairs of the church.
[3961.70 --> 3963.70]  That's how it's translated there.
[3963.70 --> 3964.70]  Right?
[3964.70 --> 3986.70]  And this is the word that leads me to conclude that this section is really about church leaders, specifically about elders, deacons, and pastors, who are together ordained to direct the affairs of the church as servant leaders, as ministers, as overseers.
[3986.70 --> 4003.70]  And caring for you in the Lord means to govern the church, to lead well, to rule with an authority that represents the authority of Christ among us.
[4003.70 --> 4010.70]  And this is confirmed with the third descriptive participle there, those who admonish you.
[4010.70 --> 4026.70]  In his letter to the Ephesians, to the Ephesian elders, that's recorded for us in the book of Acts, Paul warns the elders of the church at Ephesus, and he says to them, and I think this one we have,
[4026.70 --> 4033.70]  this one we have, keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers.
[4033.70 --> 4036.70]  There's the word, elders, leaders.
[4036.70 --> 4041.70]  Be shepherds of the church of God, which he bought with his own blood.
[4041.70 --> 4043.70]  So be on your guard.
[4043.70 --> 4050.70]  Remember that for three years I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears.
[4050.70 --> 4064.70]  Warning each of you is the same word in Acts that Luke writes with that Paul uses here in 1 Thessalonians 5, 12, for admonish.
[4064.70 --> 4067.70]  Leaders warn you.
[4067.70 --> 4070.70]  Leaders say be on the lookout.
[4070.70 --> 4075.70]  Good leaders say don't be deceived by hollow and deceptive philosophy.
[4075.70 --> 4082.70]  Leaders are the ones who stand in front of you and expose the vapid and empty spirituality of gospel substitutes,
[4082.70 --> 4086.70]  and the ones who declare to you with boldness the real thing.
[4089.70 --> 4093.70]  The ones who are weary in labor among you.
[4093.70 --> 4098.70]  The ones who direct the affairs of the church who care enough to lead in the Lord,
[4098.70 --> 4104.70]  and the ones who admonish you, who tell the truth to you when you are lying to yourselves.
[4104.70 --> 4113.70]  Those are the ones that you are instructed to acknowledge, to see, and to know.
[4113.70 --> 4119.70]  And in fact, that's what a healthy church does.
[4119.70 --> 4127.70]  Verse 13 says, hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work.
[4127.70 --> 4131.70]  Hold them in the highest regard is parallel to acknowledge them.
[4131.70 --> 4134.70]  And then to do so in love.
[4134.70 --> 4141.70]  And so with my pastoral heart for you, I ask,
[4141.70 --> 4148.70]  Are you quick to love or quick to complain?
[4148.70 --> 4158.70]  Are you quick to tell someone how it should have been done?
[4158.70 --> 4161.70]  And it's the same for those of us who work hard, right?
[4161.70 --> 4164.70]  Do you love the church that you're called to lead?
[4164.70 --> 4168.70]  Or do you complain about having to work hard?
[4168.70 --> 4175.70]  Do you count it a privilege to enter into the lives of the saints around you?
[4175.70 --> 4182.70]  Or do you struggle to see anything other than a bunch of sinners whose job it is to make you miserable?
[4182.70 --> 4187.70]  How are you showing up?
[4187.70 --> 4191.70]  And how are you acknowledging leaders who show up?
[4191.70 --> 4197.70]  And then for everyone, we read, live in peace with each other.
[4197.70 --> 4206.70]  Now, for a number of reasons based on grammar, this line seems like it could go out of place and maybe should belong with the second half.
[4206.70 --> 4210.70]  But I think actually it belongs with this first half.
[4210.70 --> 4216.70]  I think that this is a specific instruction for the church and church leader relationship.
[4216.70 --> 4218.70]  Right?
[4218.70 --> 4220.70]  There's two groups that are being held up here.
[4220.70 --> 4225.70]  The brothers and sisters, the gathering of the church, and the leaders who rule.
[4225.70 --> 4227.70]  The leaders who admonish and encourage.
[4227.70 --> 4230.70]  The pastors who labor unto weariness.
[4230.70 --> 4235.70]  The brothers and sisters and the ones called by the Holy Spirit to lead.
[4235.70 --> 4240.70]  These are the two groups that are being told to live in peace with each other.
[4240.70 --> 4243.70]  And so real candidly, this is you and I.
[4243.70 --> 4245.70]  This is all y'all and we.
[4245.70 --> 4246.70]  Right?
[4246.70 --> 4250.70]  This is every one of us who call Emmanuel Church home and family.
[4250.70 --> 4252.70]  We are charged with this peace.
[4252.70 --> 4257.70]  This is all y'all and we all together take responsibility for this peace.
[4257.70 --> 4271.70]  And it's this peace, this relationship dynamic between leaders and church family members that proves us to be a healthy church or not.
[4271.70 --> 4273.70]  It takes leaders who work hard.
[4273.70 --> 4276.70]  Leaders who care and leaders who admonish.
[4276.70 --> 4281.70]  And a healthy church takes you to acknowledge them.
[4281.70 --> 4286.70]  It takes you taking responsibility for the peace in the system.
[4286.70 --> 4293.70]  In fact, I'm going to say that the lion's share of responsibility for this peace falls to you.
[4293.70 --> 4298.70]  Because you are the consistent ones.
[4298.70 --> 4301.70]  You are the ones who make culture here.
[4301.70 --> 4305.70]  You are the ones who represent culture here.
[4305.70 --> 4308.70]  Okay, hear me carefully on this.
[4308.70 --> 4310.70]  Leaders come and go.
[4310.70 --> 4315.70]  People serve in a church for a season and then they're out.
[4315.70 --> 4318.70]  Either out of service or out of the church.
[4318.70 --> 4321.70]  But culture is constant.
[4321.70 --> 4327.70]  And if you keep a culture of loving those who lead by serving.
[4327.70 --> 4332.70]  And if you keep a culture of acknowledging the leaders among you.
[4332.70 --> 4335.70]  Of making peaceful environments for us to serve.
[4335.70 --> 4340.70]  You will find that people aren't afraid to step into leadership.
[4340.70 --> 4343.70]  You will find that people are more willing to step up.
[4343.70 --> 4346.70]  When they will feel acknowledged and seen.
[4346.70 --> 4349.70]  Rather than struggled with or complained about.
[4349.70 --> 4350.70]  Right?
[4350.70 --> 4352.70]  You create this culture.
[4352.70 --> 4358.70]  And that's why you, brothers and sisters, are addressed here.
[4358.70 --> 4364.70]  You show the mark of a healthy church just as much, maybe more.
[4364.70 --> 4367.70]  Than those of us who are called to lead.
[4367.70 --> 4378.70]  Now the second mark of a healthy church comes in the second half of this paragraph here.
[4378.70 --> 4380.70]  In verse 14.
[4380.70 --> 4381.70]  Where we read,
[4381.70 --> 4383.70]  Re-urge you, brothers and sisters.
[4383.70 --> 4388.70]  And then, if you have the eyes to see it, there are six imperatives listed there.
[4388.70 --> 4393.70]  Six things a church should do as brothers and sisters for each other.
[4393.70 --> 4394.70]  Right?
[4394.70 --> 4397.70]  Warn those who are idle and disruptive.
[4397.70 --> 4398.70]  Encourage the disheartened.
[4398.70 --> 4399.70]  Help the weak.
[4399.70 --> 4401.70]  Be patient with everyone.
[4401.70 --> 4403.70]  Make sure nobody pays back.
[4403.70 --> 4404.70]  Wrong for wrong.
[4404.70 --> 4405.70]  And then six.
[4405.70 --> 4408.70]  Always strive to do what is good.
[4408.70 --> 4413.70]  And so now again, this is you.
[4413.70 --> 4415.70]  This is your responsibility.
[4415.70 --> 4421.70]  A healthy church will warn those who are idle and disruptive.
[4421.70 --> 4428.70]  Now that word warn there is the same as the word in verse 12.
[4428.70 --> 4429.70]  Right?
[4429.70 --> 4433.70]  Who care for you and who admonish you.
[4433.70 --> 4435.70]  Admonish you in the Lord.
[4435.70 --> 4439.70]  Those who admonish you as a responsibility of leaders.
[4439.70 --> 4444.70]  But now we're seeing that that responsibility also extends to the gathering of believers.
[4444.70 --> 4445.70]  To warn.
[4445.70 --> 4446.70]  To admonish.
[4446.70 --> 4447.70]  To warn.
[4447.70 --> 4448.70]  To admonish.
[4448.70 --> 4449.70]  Right?
[4449.70 --> 4450.70]  It's not just leaders who are to warn us.
[4450.70 --> 4455.70]  But we're all supposed to admonish, to warn, and to encourage each other.
[4455.70 --> 4456.70]  To hold each other accountable.
[4456.70 --> 4458.70]  This is everyone's job.
[4458.70 --> 4459.70]  And let's be really candid.
[4459.70 --> 4460.70]  Right?
[4460.70 --> 4463.70]  Because in our culture of politeness.
[4463.70 --> 4465.70]  And our culture of tolerance.
[4465.70 --> 4466.70]  Right?
[4466.70 --> 4468.70]  It's really easy for you to sit there and go,
[4468.70 --> 4471.70]  Well, who am I to tell them what to do?
[4471.70 --> 4472.70]  I'm just as bad as they are.
[4472.70 --> 4473.70]  Maybe even worse.
[4473.70 --> 4474.70]  Right?
[4474.70 --> 4477.70]  If they knew my heart, they would never listen to me.
[4477.70 --> 4481.70]  Or it's also likely that someone might say,
[4481.70 --> 4482.70]  Don't judge me.
[4482.70 --> 4484.70]  You can't tell me what to do.
[4484.70 --> 4489.70]  But this is exactly what we're supposed to do.
[4489.70 --> 4490.70]  Right?
[4490.70 --> 4491.70]  In love.
[4491.70 --> 4492.70]  And with peace.
[4492.70 --> 4494.70]  With gentleness and respect.
[4494.70 --> 4498.70]  But you've got to warn each other against being idle and disruptive.
[4498.70 --> 4503.70]  And there's two senses then that this Greek word is at work.
[4503.70 --> 4508.70]  The word that's translated idle and disruptive is one word in Greek.
[4508.70 --> 4512.70]  And it literally means out of line or out of sync.
[4512.70 --> 4520.70]  It's used outside of the Bible to refer to a soldier who's marching out of step with their unit.
[4520.70 --> 4525.70]  So you can imagine you have a unit, an army unit that's marching in perfect cadence.
[4525.70 --> 4531.70]  And then with one of them out of step, it's glaringly obvious and disruptive to the whole.
[4531.70 --> 4533.70]  It means disorderly.
[4533.70 --> 4534.70]  It means out of line.
[4534.70 --> 4536.70]  And it can mean insubordinate.
[4536.70 --> 4544.70]  And then, insofar as we're called to work with our hands, we've seen this in the text, to not depend on others.
[4544.70 --> 4549.70]  Insofar as it means that we're not idle or lazy in our faith and in our life together.
[4549.70 --> 4554.70]  The word means to warn those who are being idle.
[4554.70 --> 4558.70]  Now, there's an interesting contrast in these two sections.
[4558.70 --> 4565.70]  Between the leader who works hard among you as an example of this kind of mature faith.
[4565.70 --> 4574.70]  And the idleness as an example of an immature faith that needs to be warned against falling into.
[4574.70 --> 4581.70]  Because too much immaturity creates instability and disorder in the body.
[4581.70 --> 4583.70]  And that's not healthy.
[4583.70 --> 4586.70]  So we need to warn each other.
[4586.70 --> 4588.70]  Hey, I see this.
[4588.70 --> 4590.70]  Hey, is this a problem?
[4590.70 --> 4592.70]  Hey, do you need help?
[4592.70 --> 4595.70]  Hey, do you need to confess something?
[4595.70 --> 4596.70]  Do you confess something?
[4596.70 --> 4607.70]  Now, in that context of warning and confession, note the next thing that we are to do together.
[4607.70 --> 4610.70]  To encourage the disheartened.
[4610.70 --> 4616.70]  Another way to translate that is to comfort the discouraged.
[4616.70 --> 4621.70]  Part of what you do for each other is to comfort the discouraged.
[4621.70 --> 4625.70]  To speak hope and help in dark times.
[4625.70 --> 4635.70]  Last week on Disney Plus, a new rock opera just came out.
[4635.70 --> 4638.70]  I know this is a pretty particular target.
[4638.70 --> 4640.70]  Those people who like rock operas.
[4640.70 --> 4643.70]  But there is a rock opera called Odessa.
[4643.70 --> 4648.70]  And Sadie Smith, who is most famous for her role in Stranger Things.
[4648.70 --> 4650.70]  And the scene running up the hill.
[4650.70 --> 4651.70]  Anyway.
[4651.70 --> 4654.70]  Sadie Smith's character is named Odessa.
[4654.70 --> 4660.70]  She is the seventh in a line of what are called ramblers.
[4660.70 --> 4667.70]  Now, ramblers in this world are traveling musicians who kind of function like a bard.
[4667.70 --> 4669.70]  A musical storyteller for the culture.
[4669.70 --> 4670.70]  And also a priest.
[4670.70 --> 4673.70]  Who mediate healing and wholeness.
[4673.70 --> 4678.70]  And she says that they describe the job of a rambler there.
[4678.70 --> 4683.70]  As to comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable.
[4683.70 --> 4690.70]  Which actually, when I was researching this, is a riff from a line in a book that was written in 1902.
[4690.70 --> 4692.70]  By Finley Peter Dunn.
[4692.70 --> 4696.70]  In which there is an Irish barman named Mr. Dooley.
[4696.70 --> 4698.70]  Who says, the newspaper.
[4698.70 --> 4700.70]  And by that he means journalism generally.
[4700.70 --> 4701.70]  Because it's 1902.
[4701.70 --> 4703.70]  The newspaper was all they had for media.
[4703.70 --> 4708.70]  Journalism comforts the afflicted and afflicts the comfortable.
[4708.70 --> 4710.70]  What I want you to see now.
[4710.70 --> 4714.70]  Is that this idea is actually rooted in the Bible.
[4714.70 --> 4718.70]  As church leaders and church communities together.
[4718.70 --> 4723.70]  We need good preachers to afflict our misplaced comforts.
[4723.70 --> 4729.70]  And we need brothers and sisters to comfort those of us who feel disheartened.
[4729.70 --> 4733.70]  This is what a healthy church looks like.
[4733.70 --> 4737.70]  Another mark of a healthy church is how we help the weak.
[4737.70 --> 4741.70]  The word weak here can mean infirmity.
[4741.70 --> 4743.70]  It can mean illness.
[4743.70 --> 4746.70]  And so we're called to help those who are struggling with health.
[4746.70 --> 4750.70]  And to walk alongside those who are in treatment for one thing or another.
[4750.70 --> 4753.70]  To care for those who can't care for themselves.
[4753.70 --> 4757.70]  But the word can also have spiritual connotations.
[4757.70 --> 4760.70]  It can also have moral implications.
[4760.70 --> 4765.70]  And so we're supposed to help each other and encourage one another to grow in our faith.
[4765.70 --> 4766.70]  Right?
[4766.70 --> 4769.70]  To grow in our relationship to God through Jesus Christ.
[4769.70 --> 4773.70]  To grow in our relationship as brothers and sisters together.
[4773.70 --> 4777.70]  We're supposed to help each other grow in our obedience to Jesus Christ.
[4777.70 --> 4780.70]  And in living in mutual submission to him.
[4780.70 --> 4785.70]  Now that means we not only have to be willing to give help.
[4785.70 --> 4790.70]  It also means we have to be willing to accept help.
[4790.70 --> 4793.70]  To accept correction.
[4793.70 --> 4796.70]  And I don't know about you.
[4796.70 --> 4801.70]  But it seems to me that for most of us, that second part is probably the harder one.
[4801.70 --> 4805.70]  We can give all the help in the world.
[4805.70 --> 4808.70]  But it becomes really hard when we have to accept it.
[4808.70 --> 4814.70]  But by accepting help, by accepting encouragement,
[4814.70 --> 4819.70]  you are part of making it possible for us together to be a healthy church.
[4819.70 --> 4821.70]  And to live out that health.
[4821.70 --> 4824.70]  And the truth of the matter is,
[4824.70 --> 4828.70]  you may be in a season where you have to accept help.
[4828.70 --> 4830.70]  And I may be in a season where I have to give help.
[4830.70 --> 4833.70]  But you better believe those tables are going to turn.
[4833.70 --> 4836.70]  And then they'll turn again, and again, and again.
[4836.70 --> 4838.70]  Because that's what happens in life together.
[4838.70 --> 4847.70]  Healthy churches, we read, are places of patience.
[4847.70 --> 4850.70]  Now the root of this is probably self-explanatory.
[4850.70 --> 4857.70]  The practice of it, especially in a community of a few hundred people, can be really hard.
[4857.70 --> 4858.70]  Right?
[4858.70 --> 4862.70]  Because there always seems to be at least one person, and if you have only one, you're doing good,
[4862.70 --> 4867.70]  who just gets under your skin.
[4867.70 --> 4872.70]  If you've ever parented young kids, you know the difficulty of this.
[4872.70 --> 4873.70]  Right?
[4873.70 --> 4875.70]  I'll use language that's common today.
[4875.70 --> 4878.70]  You know all the techniques of gentle parenting.
[4878.70 --> 4883.70]  But the fifth time your kid doesn't listen, gentleness goes out the window.
[4883.70 --> 4884.70]  Am I right?
[4884.70 --> 4885.70]  No?
[4885.70 --> 4887.70]  Is that just me?
[4887.70 --> 4890.70]  Please, don't leave me alone.
[4890.70 --> 4897.70]  A healthy church is patient even with that one person.
[4897.70 --> 4902.70]  Especially with that one person.
[4902.70 --> 4906.70]  That's actually a mark of what makes it supernatural.
[4906.70 --> 4907.70]  Right?
[4907.70 --> 4912.70]  That apart from the grace of God, I could never be patient in that moment.
[4912.70 --> 4917.70]  Because of the grace of God, somehow, by his spirit, we can.
[4917.70 --> 4918.70]  Together.
[4918.70 --> 4924.70]  Healthy churches make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong.
[4924.70 --> 4928.70]  Now I take this to be an instruction towards justice.
[4928.70 --> 4934.70]  But justice defined in the sort of inverted economy of the kingdom of God sense.
[4934.70 --> 4935.70]  Right?
[4935.70 --> 4941.70]  Justice infused with mercy, such that when someone does evil, we don't allow evil in response.
[4941.70 --> 4946.70]  Instead, we seek to restore them to God and to each other, to the fellowship.
[4946.70 --> 4949.70]  And this kind of restoration is hard.
[4949.70 --> 4957.70]  And again, to be honest, in our culture of easy believism and consuming church as a product,
[4957.70 --> 4961.70]  most people today don't have that kind of commitment to each other.
[4961.70 --> 4966.70]  Instead of restoration, we just leave and find another church.
[4966.70 --> 4975.70]  Instead of listening to spiritual leaders that God has given us, we walk away from the hard things that they're calling us to.
[4975.70 --> 4983.70]  And to be sure, good leaders will weary themselves in trying to draw these people back to the fellowship.
[4983.70 --> 4986.70]  But we can't make anybody do that work.
[4986.70 --> 4995.70]  You've got to want to be a healthy church member in order to receive this well.
[4995.70 --> 5001.70]  And lastly, a healthy church strives to do good for each other.
[5001.70 --> 5006.70]  And, notice that and, for everyone else.
[5006.70 --> 5019.70]  I love this because there's a sense here in which the good that we do here for this community spills forward and spills out to the rest of the neighborhood, to the rest of the community around us.
[5019.70 --> 5033.70]  The mark of a healthy church is that its eyes are simultaneously looking inward to care for brothers and sisters here and outward to be a presence of God's love and God's goodness in the world.
[5033.70 --> 5037.70]  And it's not first here and then out there.
[5037.70 --> 5044.70]  It's not that we have to get stuff figured out here internally before we can go out externally.
[5044.70 --> 5052.70]  It's not that we have to get our mission and ministry right here before we can see mission and ministry beyond these walls in the community.
[5052.70 --> 5055.70]  It's both and, always both and.
[5055.70 --> 5057.70]  That's the core of being a healthy church.
[5057.70 --> 5071.70]  A healthy church is always essentially, and I mean core to its being when I use the word essential there, essentially looking beyond its walls and inviting people to experience the goodness of God through us.
[5071.70 --> 5081.70]  Healthy churches acknowledge those who work hard among them, who care for you and admonish you.
[5081.70 --> 5085.70]  Healthy churches warn those who are out of step.
[5085.70 --> 5087.70]  They comfort the discouraged and afflict the comfortable.
[5087.70 --> 5091.70]  Healthy churches help the weak and are patient with everyone.
[5091.70 --> 5096.70]  Healthy churches live inverted kingdom justice, restoring people to relationship.
[5096.70 --> 5103.70]  And healthy churches live for its own and for those beyond her walls.
[5103.70 --> 5106.70]  Do you want to be a healthy church?
[5106.70 --> 5109.70]  Thank you.
[5109.70 --> 5114.70]  This is your work.
[5114.70 --> 5117.70]  Only you can do this.
[5117.70 --> 5123.70]  And I often say that the work of sermon application is yours.
[5123.70 --> 5125.70]  That's not my job.
[5125.70 --> 5136.70]  I open up the text and hopefully through this message, through these words, you hear the words of Jesus and you hear in them an invitation to something compelling and beautiful.
[5136.70 --> 5139.70]  Something that moves your heart and soul in worship.
[5139.70 --> 5142.70]  But you have to move.
[5142.70 --> 5145.70]  You have to step.
[5145.70 --> 5148.70]  Jesus is calling.
[5148.70 --> 5151.70]  And so let's be a healthy church together.
[5151.70 --> 5152.70]  Amen?
[5152.70 --> 5154.70]  Let's pray.
[5154.70 --> 5161.70]  God, you are so good.
[5161.70 --> 5165.70]  You have shown us your goodness in your word.
[5165.70 --> 5168.70]  You have given us a picture of what a healthy church looks like.
[5168.70 --> 5180.70]  You have painted for us with clarity and precision what it means to be a good leader and what it means to be a healthy church in relationship to our leaders and into our ministry and mission together.
[5180.70 --> 5184.70]  And so may we catch your vision for us today.
[5184.70 --> 5191.70]  May this truth be planted deep in our hearts and may we live it out.
[5191.70 --> 5197.70]  May this be the culture of Langley Emanuel from this moment forward.
[5197.70 --> 5200.70]  As it has been, may it so be.
[5200.70 --> 5205.70]  And where we have fallen short, may we grow in your grace.
[5205.70 --> 5215.70]  Hear our prayer we pray Lord Jesus.
[5215.70 --> 5216.70]  Amen.
[5216.70 --> 5217.70]  Amen.
[5217.70 --> 5227.30]  when we rise and join our voices in this song.
[5228.08 --> 5234.34]  It's a song of what we can look as together
[5234.34 --> 5237.30]  as we share Christ's love with each other.
[5247.70 --> 5258.54]  We are one in the Spirit, we are one in the Lord.
[5258.54 --> 5264.78]  We are one in the Spirit, we are one in the Lord.
[5265.08 --> 5270.92]  And we pray that all unity may one day be restored
[5270.92 --> 5275.66]  and they'll know we are Christians by our love,
[5275.66 --> 5282.40]  by our love, yes and no, we are Christians by our love.
[5285.82 --> 5292.34]  We will walk with each other, we will walk hand in hand.
[5292.60 --> 5298.44]  We will walk with each other, we will walk hand in hand.
