[1797.76 --> 1801.76]  On Calvary's tree
[1801.76 --> 1803.76]  I love thee

[1835.76 --> 1839.76]  And praise thee
[1839.76 --> 1845.76]  As long as thou lendest me breath
[1845.76 --> 1847.76]  And say
[1847.76 --> 1849.76]  And say
[1849.76 --> 1851.76]  When the death
[1851.76 --> 1853.76]  Doe lies

[1854.76 --> 1855.76]  On my brow
[1855.76 --> 1859.76]  If ever
[1859.76 --> 1861.76]  I love thee
[1861.76 --> 1863.76]  My Jesus
[1863.76 --> 1865.76]  Tis now
[1865.76 --> 1867.76]  In
[1867.76 --> 1869.76]  Mansions

[1877.76 --> 1879.76]  Endless
[1879.76 --> 1881.76]  Delight
[1881.76 --> 1883.76]  I'll

[1884.76 --> 1885.76]  Adore

[1960.76 --> 1967.20]  Located in Edmonton, the King's University offers exceptional liberal arts education
[1967.20 --> 1974.50]  from a Christian perspective and serves students from across Canada and from around the world.
[1974.50 --> 1977.64]  For more information, you can check out their website.
[1977.64 --> 1980.60]  They're either on your computer or on your phone.
[1980.60 --> 1986.10]  There is a link in our online bulletin this morning.
[1986.10 --> 1992.60]  And please give as the Lord has blessed you for this Christian organization.
[1992.60 --> 1993.60]  Thanks.
[2016.10 --> 2035.10]  This is the air I breathe.
[2035.10 --> 2042.60]  This is the air I breathe.
[2042.60 --> 2054.60]  Your holy presence living in me.
[2054.60 --> 2062.10]  This is my daily bread.
[2062.10 --> 2069.60]  This is my daily bread.
[2069.60 --> 2081.60]  Your very word spoken to me.
[2081.60 --> 2092.10]  And I, I'm desperate for you.
[2092.10 --> 2106.10]  And I, I'm lost without you.
[2106.10 --> 2125.60]  This is the air I breathe.
[2125.60 --> 2133.10]  This is the air I breathe.
[2133.10 --> 2144.10]  Your holy presence living in me.
[2144.10 --> 2152.60]  This is my daily bread.
[2152.60 --> 2158.60]  This is my daily bread.
[2158.60 --> 2160.10]  This is my daily bread.
[2160.10 --> 2161.10]  This is my daily bread.
[2161.10 --> 2162.10]  This is my daily bread.
[2162.10 --> 2165.10]  I'm desperate for you.
[2165.10 --> 2169.60]  You're very well spoken to me.
[2169.60 --> 2184.10]  And I, I'm desperate for you.
[2184.10 --> 2191.10]  I'm lost without you.
[2194.10 --> 2202.10]  And I'm desperate for you.
[2202.10 --> 2214.10]  And I'm lost without you.
[2214.10 --> 2227.10]  And I'm lost without you.
[2227.10 --> 2233.10]  You are the air I breathe.
[2233.10 --> 2239.10]  You are the air.
[2248.10 --> 2249.10]  Good morning, kids.
[2249.10 --> 2251.10]  If you are age three up into grade four,
[2251.10 --> 2254.10]  I'd like to invite you to come join me up at front here
[2254.10 --> 2256.10]  for Kids Corner.
[2256.10 --> 2259.10]  And then we'll continue learning more in children's worship time
[2259.10 --> 2260.10]  when we're finished.
[2260.10 --> 2273.10]  Okay, here's my question for you today.
[2273.10 --> 2277.10]  I'm wondering if anyone has ever had a backwards day,
[2277.10 --> 2279.10]  like at school or at home,
[2279.10 --> 2282.10]  where you kind of did things in the opposite way of normal.
[2282.10 --> 2283.10]  Have you ever done that?
[2283.10 --> 2286.10]  No? Nobody's done that before?
[2286.10 --> 2287.10]  Oh, Ruby's done it before.
[2287.10 --> 2289.10]  I know that we've done that at our school.
[2289.10 --> 2291.10]  Can you think with me, if we were having a backwards day,
[2291.10 --> 2293.10]  what would we do first?
[2293.10 --> 2296.10]  Like we would get up, we'd have to get up, I guess.
[2296.10 --> 2299.10]  So we'd get up our bed and then maybe we'd have to do what?
[2299.10 --> 2303.10]  Yeah, we'd have to maybe eat dinner or put our pajamas on.
[2303.10 --> 2305.10]  And then we'd have to eat dinner.
[2305.10 --> 2307.10]  And then what might we do after we eat dinner?
[2307.10 --> 2312.10]  Yeah, we'd have to go back to sleep in the morning.
[2312.10 --> 2313.10]  You're right. That would be the opposite.
[2313.10 --> 2318.10]  Then we might have to go to our soccer or dance or gymnastics
[2318.10 --> 2319.10]  or piano lesson.
[2319.10 --> 2324.10]  And then we'd have to have some lunch and then go to school, I guess,
[2324.10 --> 2327.10]  and then have breakfast and then go back to bed.
[2327.10 --> 2329.10]  It would be kind of an interesting day, right?
[2329.10 --> 2331.10]  If we lived our whole day backwards.
[2331.10 --> 2335.10]  Some things in our life are pretty tricky if we try to do them backwards.
[2335.10 --> 2340.10]  But today, what we're going to learn about is how we can live backwards here on Earth.
[2340.10 --> 2343.10]  Because we know that God is going to come back,
[2343.10 --> 2346.10]  that Jesus is coming back and that we get to live with him in heaven.
[2346.10 --> 2351.10]  And when we already know the ending, that helps us to live backwards on Earth.
[2351.10 --> 2353.10]  And if that sounds a little bit strange, that's okay.
[2353.10 --> 2356.10]  Because that's why we're going to go to children's worship time
[2356.10 --> 2358.10]  and figure out what I mean by that.
[2358.10 --> 2360.10]  So you can stand up.
[2360.10 --> 2361.10]  We'll do our blessing.
[2361.10 --> 2364.10]  And then we'll head off to children's worship.
[2364.10 --> 2365.10]  We'll head off to children's worship.
[2365.10 --> 2366.10]  We'll head off to children's worship.
[2394.10 --> 2399.10]  Hi, I'm Eric, an elder here at Emanuel.
[2399.10 --> 2404.10]  I'm here to give our council updates and notes from this past week.
[2404.10 --> 2408.10]  This week council approved the letter of call to Pastor Kevin.
[2408.10 --> 2415.10]  We selected delegates to classes to be held on October 21st and 22nd at Fleetwood.
[2415.10 --> 2419.34]  We received our update from Pastor Chris, Pastor Kevin and Josh.
[2419.98 --> 2426.66]  We also had an update from us, from myself here at Board of Stewarts, just highlighting the sanctuary improvements.
[2426.80 --> 2427.78]  They've nearly been completed.
[2427.88 --> 2433.76]  A little bit of finishing touches to be done on the inside with all the mold and rot removed from both inside and outside.
[2437.08 --> 2442.10]  In following down the road, we will be concentrating on finishing the patchwork outside,
[2442.10 --> 2447.44]  but also potentially painting the outside of our sanctuary to get rid of the graffiti and update that as well.
[2447.54 --> 2454.76]  But on that note, from a deacon, not deacon, but from a Board of Stewarts, we started to update some of the classrooms.
[2455.84 --> 2459.12]  By that, I mean we've been doing some repair work and getting painting done.
[2459.56 --> 2461.58]  I don't mind painting, but I don't love painting.
[2461.72 --> 2469.74]  So I'm looking for anyone who's willing to help out in the evenings or on weekends just to start tackling a couple of the hallways and classrooms.
[2469.74 --> 2477.08]  So if anyone wants to touch base with me and is willing to help out in doing some of the maintenance, helping with painting, that would be greatly appreciated.
[2477.94 --> 2486.12]  Also, this time of year, the Church and Finance Committee, it's our budget presentation season again.
[2486.94 --> 2496.10]  So in our e-bulletins, there's also copies in the office, but we would love to see some of those ministries next year's budgets to be filled out for October 10th.
[2496.10 --> 2499.76]  And if there's any further questions, contact Marilyn in the office.
[2500.30 --> 2500.88]  Thank you.
[2506.22 --> 2506.78]  Thank you.
[2514.78 --> 2515.42]  Good morning.
[2515.52 --> 2516.22]  My name is Dave.
[2516.22 --> 2522.70]  I am one of the elders that serves this church community, and it is my turn to lead in our church family prayer.
[2523.06 --> 2524.06]  Will you pray with me?
[2526.10 --> 2529.98]  Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth.
[2530.18 --> 2531.64]  Worship the Lord with gladness.
[2532.18 --> 2534.24]  Come before him with joyful songs.
[2534.78 --> 2539.88]  Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise, and give thanks to him and praise his name.
[2540.80 --> 2544.40]  Father, once again, we celebrate this Sunday, this Lord's Day.
[2544.90 --> 2551.26]  We are members of the church universal and this Christian community, so we gather to give thanks to you and praise your name.
[2551.26 --> 2559.80]  Father, once again, we see the need to confess our sins to you, both in our personal lives and how we interact with others.
[2560.60 --> 2561.90]  We are sinful people.
[2561.90 --> 2569.20]  It is because of human sin and human rebellion that we need to be reconciled to you and that Jesus needed to come down.
[2569.20 --> 2580.04]  In particular, as Canadians take part in the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, we see the great harm that was done in residential schools by our nation and various churches.
[2580.54 --> 2584.76]  A policy that led to loss of heritage, loss of identity, and loss of life.
[2584.76 --> 2596.32]  Because the injustice was carried out by elected governments from both parties, under 20 prime ministers, and in the name of all Canadians, then all Canadians need to be part of the solution.
[2597.04 --> 2600.56]  Father, we look to the love and sacrifice of Jesus to guide us.
[2600.98 --> 2602.74]  As Paul tells the church in Ephesus,
[2602.74 --> 2624.46]  Father, once again, we come to you because we have many reasons to be thankful.
[2624.88 --> 2627.86]  We thank you for the changing seasons and the beginning of fall.
[2627.86 --> 2633.34]  It is an opportunity for all of us to spend some time outdoors and to experience the beauty of your creation.
[2634.42 --> 2637.74]  We thank you for this church family and everyone who has gathered here.
[2638.06 --> 2640.16]  We thank you for the leadership of this church.
[2640.88 --> 2644.06]  Pastor Chris, Pastor Kevin, Josh, the members of the council.
[2644.54 --> 2648.92]  We thank you for the many ministries of this church that have returned after a summer hiatus.
[2650.16 --> 2652.52]  Bless these ministries and the work that they do.
[2652.96 --> 2656.24]  May they meet the spiritual and physical needs that we see around us.
[2656.24 --> 2662.14]  Father, once again, we think of the joys and needs that we have as a Christian community.
[2662.78 --> 2664.60]  We think about the needs of the world.
[2665.12 --> 2669.24]  We pray again for the conflicts in Ukraine and Russia, in Israel and Gaza,
[2669.50 --> 2672.48]  and we fear the possibility that either one could escalate.
[2673.32 --> 2676.68]  But those are just the conflicts that we see so often in the news.
[2676.68 --> 2682.48]  It is easy not to notice conflicts in Sudan, Myanmar, Somalia, Yemen, and other places.
[2682.48 --> 2687.88]  We pray for all leaders that they may see the value of living next to each other as neighbors
[2687.88 --> 2692.00]  and use that as a basis for achieving a meaningful and lasting peace.
[2693.24 --> 2696.06]  Father, once again, we think about the needs of this congregation.
[2696.90 --> 2700.94]  We pray for all the students and educators who have returned to grade school and post-secondary.
[2700.94 --> 2706.06]  We pray that after a positive start, they may have a great year of learning about themselves,
[2706.48 --> 2708.96]  their place in the world, and their relationship with you.
[2709.84 --> 2713.24]  We thank you that Rachel DeWinter's gallbladder surgery was successful.
[2713.86 --> 2716.52]  We pray for a smooth and speedy recovery at home.
[2717.26 --> 2722.18]  We pray for Heather Varsstra as she is recovering at home from an asthma flare-up.
[2722.52 --> 2725.48]  We pray for patience and healing as she continues to rest,
[2725.66 --> 2727.90]  and we trust in your continued care over her.
[2727.90 --> 2732.78]  We pray again for John Kuypers, who is waiting for a biopsy to give him clarity
[2732.78 --> 2735.66]  on what has been a long road to a proper diagnosis.
[2736.42 --> 2738.12]  We pray for a speedy diagnosis.
[2738.72 --> 2741.34]  We pray that you will ease any anxiety and uncertainty,
[2741.96 --> 2745.90]  that you will bless the procedure, and that it will lead to a full restoration of his health.
[2746.88 --> 2751.44]  We thank you that Tessa has learned that her lymphoma is still in remission.
[2751.94 --> 2753.80]  We do pray for the spot on her colon,
[2753.80 --> 2756.46]  and are grateful that this new cancer was caught early,
[2756.90 --> 2759.40]  and appears to be operable with high hopes of success.
[2760.12 --> 2763.22]  We pray that she will experience your peace as she waits for surgery.
[2764.48 --> 2768.12]  We pray for Judy Dykstra, who had surgery to remove kidney stones,
[2768.56 --> 2769.74]  and has returned home.
[2770.08 --> 2773.44]  We pray for a quick recovery and a full restoration of her health.
[2773.44 --> 2777.66]  We pray for Ellen White, who has received some cortisone shots in her knees,
[2778.10 --> 2781.38]  and is anticipating another surgery on her hip in a couple of months.
[2781.88 --> 2786.62]  We pray for a successful treatment, and that she can feel your peace in tangible ways.
[2787.48 --> 2792.28]  And Father, once again, we pray for Pastor Chris as he leads a study of your word,
[2792.62 --> 2794.84]  as revealed to the teacher in Ecclesiastes.
[2794.84 --> 2804.64]  Father, we pray for the Lord is good, and his love endures forever.
[2805.08 --> 2807.52]  His faithfulness continues through all generations.
[2808.68 --> 2809.00]  Amen.
[2824.84 --> 2833.42]  In addition to all the many things that are going on around here,
[2833.70 --> 2838.70]  this past week, a small group of us gathered together on Thursday night for prayer.
[2839.96 --> 2843.24]  And one of the things that we prayed for,
[2843.42 --> 2846.66]  and circumstances, situations that we prayed over,
[2847.32 --> 2851.66]  was for the life of this church, the ministry of this church,
[2851.66 --> 2854.66]  and discipleship that has been happening here.
[2854.84 --> 2859.94]  Especially, the prayer went among young people.
[2861.28 --> 2866.26]  I don't know if you've seen it, but I have made mention of it previously as well.
[2866.76 --> 2874.16]  Even one of the mainstream media channels, news stations,
[2875.10 --> 2876.78]  that I sometimes listen to,
[2876.78 --> 2878.54]  this past weekend,
[2878.54 --> 2886.48]  had a report on the burgeoning movement of Gen Z Christians.
[2887.38 --> 2893.30]  So the fastest growing religious demographic in Canada is Gen Z,
[2893.64 --> 2896.96]  is the 20 to sort of 25 year olds right now.
[2896.96 --> 2900.32]  And so we prayed into that, and we wondered,
[2900.44 --> 2903.54]  what does that look like in an age such as ours,
[2903.74 --> 2907.02]  an age where what meaning is, and how we find meaning,
[2907.10 --> 2908.06]  and how we find purpose,
[2908.58 --> 2909.94]  is up for grabs?
[2910.60 --> 2916.40]  How can we offer something as a church that is firm and solid,
[2916.40 --> 2918.98]  that is fixed in the truth,
[2918.98 --> 2927.98]  but is shapeable, malleable enough to face whatever circumstance you might be standing in,
[2928.32 --> 2932.48]  or walking in, or whatever hardship you might be sitting in the midst of?
[2932.48 --> 2939.48]  Providentially, at the same time as we were praying that,
[2939.64 --> 2942.20]  and as we were hearing these news reports,
[2942.64 --> 2947.30]  we had planned to do a series in the book of Ecclesiastes.
[2948.44 --> 2952.38]  Now, if you've been around the church for a while, for a lifetime,
[2953.06 --> 2956.14]  Ecclesiastes is one of the most,
[2956.36 --> 2957.68]  and I'm going to use this word intentionally,
[2958.22 --> 2961.08]  enigmatic books in the Bible.
[2961.08 --> 2969.02]  It's a wisdom literature book that sometimes is really strange and hard to read,
[2969.44 --> 2973.52]  and it's our hope and my intent to help us see
[2973.52 --> 2978.92]  how Ecclesiastes is exactly the word from God we need
[2978.92 --> 2982.48]  in this particular cultural moment and circumstance.
[2984.00 --> 2988.00]  To do that, we're going to start at the end.
[2988.00 --> 2992.22]  Now, that will become clear as we go through as to why,
[2992.66 --> 2995.52]  but I'm going to read from Ecclesiastes 12,
[2996.48 --> 2997.78]  starting at verse 8,
[2998.10 --> 3001.36]  through to the end of the book, which is verse 14,
[3002.48 --> 3006.54]  and we'll dig in to that as we go,
[3006.68 --> 3009.38]  and I hope it will become clear why we start at the end
[3009.38 --> 3012.64]  in order to see how that impacts the beginning.
[3012.64 --> 3014.60]  Let's read together.
[3017.00 --> 3020.44]  Meaningless, meaningless, says the teacher.
[3021.34 --> 3023.74]  Everything is meaningless.
[3026.74 --> 3029.26]  Not only was the teacher wise,
[3029.78 --> 3032.26]  but he also imparted knowledge to the people.
[3033.42 --> 3037.74]  He pondered and searched out and set in order many proverbs.
[3037.74 --> 3042.64]  The teacher searched to find just the right words,
[3042.92 --> 3045.94]  and what he wrote was upright and true.
[3047.02 --> 3049.74]  The words of the wise are like goads.
[3050.68 --> 3054.16]  They're collected sayings like firmly embedded nails
[3054.16 --> 3056.52]  given by one shepherd.
[3057.48 --> 3061.20]  Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them.
[3061.20 --> 3065.02]  Of making many books there is no end,
[3065.18 --> 3067.18]  and much study wearies the body.
[3069.00 --> 3070.52]  Now all has been heard.
[3071.24 --> 3073.78]  Here is the conclusion of the matter.
[3075.24 --> 3077.20]  Fear God and keep his commandments,
[3078.06 --> 3080.76]  for this is the duty of all mankind.
[3081.82 --> 3084.88]  For God will bring every deed into judgment,
[3085.48 --> 3087.58]  including every hidden thing,
[3087.84 --> 3090.10]  whether it is good or evil.
[3091.20 --> 3092.56]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3097.06 --> 3099.44]  When it went out in the e-bulletin
[3099.44 --> 3101.06]  that this was the text
[3101.06 --> 3103.40]  that we would be starting this series on,
[3104.08 --> 3106.70]  my mother, bless her heart,
[3107.16 --> 3109.12]  read the text and saw the line
[3109.12 --> 3110.48]  of the making of many books,
[3110.58 --> 3111.32]  there is no end,
[3111.44 --> 3113.38]  and much study wearies the body.
[3113.90 --> 3115.46]  And she reached out to me and she said,
[3115.48 --> 3116.36]  is this a cry for help?
[3117.10 --> 3117.74]  Are you tired?
[3117.74 --> 3118.40]  Are you tired?
[3121.20 --> 3124.90]  What I hope we might see
[3124.90 --> 3129.34]  is how it is that the message of Ecclesiastes
[3129.34 --> 3133.46]  speaks a word of truth
[3133.46 --> 3136.30]  and meaning and purpose
[3136.30 --> 3140.20]  in an age where truth, meaning, and purpose
[3140.20 --> 3141.62]  are so hard to find.
[3141.62 --> 3147.68]  I want to begin by naming a reality
[3147.68 --> 3149.12]  that most of us,
[3149.22 --> 3150.88]  whether we realize it or not,
[3151.56 --> 3155.32]  are living in the midst of or out of.
[3157.56 --> 3158.86]  In the world today,
[3158.98 --> 3162.34]  we are told from incredibly various sources
[3162.34 --> 3165.76]  and using incredibly varied language
[3165.76 --> 3167.12]  and ways of saying it,
[3167.12 --> 3170.52]  but we are told that the goal of life
[3170.52 --> 3173.22]  is to be true to yourself,
[3173.62 --> 3176.20]  to look inside,
[3176.42 --> 3179.26]  to discover who you really are,
[3179.26 --> 3181.52]  and then to live that idea
[3181.52 --> 3183.44]  in that way without apology.
[3183.44 --> 3187.72]  In fact,
[3188.08 --> 3191.80]  we're told that if someone tries to tell you otherwise,
[3192.06 --> 3192.70]  it's oppressive,
[3193.28 --> 3197.30]  and that these kinds of words themselves are violent.
[3199.14 --> 3200.36]  Now, let me be really clear,
[3200.44 --> 3201.72]  because I think we can do a better job
[3201.72 --> 3203.86]  of learning how to speak with gentleness and respect.
[3204.76 --> 3205.14]  Okay?
[3205.18 --> 3206.18]  I know that that is true,
[3207.14 --> 3208.28]  but there's something here.
[3208.28 --> 3210.92]  We live in a time,
[3211.00 --> 3211.44]  in a moment,
[3211.56 --> 3212.36]  in a culture
[3212.36 --> 3213.64]  where we assume
[3213.64 --> 3214.96]  or we're told
[3214.96 --> 3216.28]  that progress
[3216.28 --> 3217.64]  and technology
[3217.64 --> 3219.24]  will save us.
[3220.42 --> 3222.30]  That if we just keep advancing,
[3222.78 --> 3223.96]  if we just keep learning,
[3224.20 --> 3225.56]  if we just keep innovating,
[3226.00 --> 3227.68]  life will finally work out
[3227.68 --> 3228.86]  the way it's supposed to be.
[3233.42 --> 3235.28]  We live in a time and a place
[3235.28 --> 3236.80]  where comfort
[3236.80 --> 3238.16]  and happiness
[3238.16 --> 3239.40]  are the things
[3239.40 --> 3240.60]  that we pursue
[3240.60 --> 3241.36]  and chase
[3241.36 --> 3243.88]  as the point of life
[3243.88 --> 3247.26]  in order to feel good
[3247.26 --> 3248.92]  and to avoid
[3248.92 --> 3250.62]  the other limiting factors.
[3250.94 --> 3251.32]  Comfort
[3251.32 --> 3252.12]  and happiness
[3252.12 --> 3253.86]  is the goal.
[3255.22 --> 3255.86]  And,
[3255.98 --> 3256.74]  we live in a time
[3256.74 --> 3257.54]  and a place
[3257.54 --> 3259.14]  where we're told
[3259.14 --> 3260.38]  that God
[3260.38 --> 3261.14]  is optional.
[3262.50 --> 3262.64]  Right?
[3262.66 --> 3263.38]  That if God
[3263.38 --> 3264.30]  is good
[3264.30 --> 3265.04]  for you
[3265.04 --> 3265.72]  to achieve
[3265.72 --> 3266.46]  that comfort,
[3266.80 --> 3267.88]  and that happiness,
[3268.04 --> 3268.58]  then great.
[3268.84 --> 3269.18]  Go.
[3269.40 --> 3269.94]  Do it.
[3270.94 --> 3272.30]  But it is not true
[3272.30 --> 3273.00]  for everyone.
[3274.56 --> 3274.68]  Right?
[3274.70 --> 3276.22]  It's a personal
[3276.22 --> 3277.50]  and private
[3277.50 --> 3278.66]  belief.
[3278.82 --> 3279.62]  It is not
[3279.62 --> 3280.44]  the center
[3280.44 --> 3282.06]  of reality.
[3284.28 --> 3284.80]  Now,
[3284.84 --> 3285.10]  like we said,
[3285.18 --> 3286.06]  these assumptions
[3286.06 --> 3287.68]  promise meaning
[3287.68 --> 3288.60]  and,
[3288.78 --> 3289.52]  hear this very carefully,
[3289.78 --> 3291.02]  they promise control.
[3291.02 --> 3291.08]  people.
[3293.96 --> 3295.06]  But when the bottom
[3295.06 --> 3295.92]  falls out,
[3297.40 --> 3297.62]  right,
[3297.66 --> 3298.62]  when life gets hard,
[3299.52 --> 3300.22]  when death
[3300.22 --> 3301.38]  feels close,
[3302.38 --> 3303.62]  when you wonder
[3303.62 --> 3305.08]  what all the busyness
[3305.08 --> 3305.64]  is for,
[3306.40 --> 3306.56]  right,
[3306.56 --> 3307.24]  when I move from
[3307.24 --> 3308.46]  exhaustion to exhaustion
[3308.46 --> 3309.20]  to exhaustion,
[3309.44 --> 3310.48]  what's the purpose?
[3311.66 --> 3312.48]  These things,
[3312.64 --> 3313.48]  when they don't
[3313.48 --> 3314.26]  hold up,
[3315.62 --> 3315.76]  right,
[3315.76 --> 3316.74]  what are you to do
[3316.74 --> 3317.60]  when life
[3317.60 --> 3319.04]  doesn't make sense
[3319.04 --> 3319.66]  anymore?
[3320.52 --> 3321.80]  When your search
[3321.80 --> 3322.52]  for meaning
[3322.52 --> 3323.84]  seems to slip
[3323.84 --> 3325.50]  through your fingers
[3325.50 --> 3326.66]  like smoke
[3326.66 --> 3327.80]  from a candle?
[3329.88 --> 3330.58]  That
[3330.58 --> 3332.38]  is when the book
[3332.38 --> 3333.30]  of Ecclesiastes
[3333.30 --> 3334.76]  speaks
[3334.76 --> 3336.50]  a more beautiful word.
[3336.50 --> 3338.96]  That's why
[3338.96 --> 3339.26]  the book
[3339.26 --> 3339.96]  of Ecclesiastes
[3339.96 --> 3340.96]  is for this
[3340.96 --> 3342.24]  present moment.
[3342.38 --> 3343.14]  One writer
[3343.14 --> 3343.80]  has put it
[3343.80 --> 3344.20]  this way,
[3344.28 --> 3344.60]  they've said,
[3344.96 --> 3345.88]  Ecclesiastes
[3345.88 --> 3347.04]  calls those
[3347.04 --> 3347.64]  struggling
[3347.64 --> 3348.62]  with the nature
[3348.62 --> 3349.70]  of life's meaning
[3349.70 --> 3350.80]  and God's purposes
[3350.80 --> 3352.08]  to pursue
[3352.08 --> 3353.58]  genuine wisdom
[3353.58 --> 3355.36]  by allowing
[3355.36 --> 3356.28]  their thinking
[3356.28 --> 3357.20]  to be shaped
[3357.20 --> 3358.24]  integrally
[3358.24 --> 3359.62]  by a recognition
[3359.62 --> 3360.28]  of God
[3360.28 --> 3361.00]  as creator
[3361.00 --> 3362.64]  so that they
[3362.64 --> 3363.34]  can enjoy
[3363.34 --> 3364.28]  God's good gifts
[3364.28 --> 3365.08]  and obey
[3365.08 --> 3365.82]  his laws
[3365.82 --> 3366.78]  amid the
[3366.78 --> 3367.68]  enigmas
[3367.68 --> 3368.82]  of his
[3368.82 --> 3369.76]  purposes.
[3370.26 --> 3370.84]  That was a lot,
[3370.92 --> 3371.70]  let's dig into that.
[3372.98 --> 3373.42]  In short,
[3373.72 --> 3374.22]  the preacher
[3374.22 --> 3375.26]  or the teacher
[3375.26 --> 3376.34]  in Ecclesiastes
[3376.34 --> 3377.36]  wants you
[3377.36 --> 3378.34]  to wake up.
[3380.70 --> 3381.14]  He's not going
[3381.14 --> 3381.54]  to give us
[3381.54 --> 3382.34]  simple answers
[3382.34 --> 3383.22]  because we're not
[3383.22 --> 3384.38]  asking simple questions.
[3386.90 --> 3388.06]  The teacher
[3388.06 --> 3388.68]  is going to
[3388.68 --> 3389.72]  force us
[3389.72 --> 3390.86]  to face
[3390.86 --> 3391.84]  the limits
[3391.84 --> 3392.76]  of life
[3392.76 --> 3393.82]  honestly.
[3393.82 --> 3395.58]  and he's
[3395.58 --> 3395.82]  going to
[3395.82 --> 3396.50]  teach us
[3396.50 --> 3396.82]  that the
[3396.82 --> 3397.62]  only way
[3397.62 --> 3398.22]  to live
[3398.22 --> 3398.96]  wisely
[3398.96 --> 3400.68]  is to live,
[3400.78 --> 3401.16]  as Nicky
[3401.16 --> 3401.64]  has already
[3401.64 --> 3402.02]  said,
[3402.42 --> 3402.76]  backwards.
[3404.30 --> 3405.18]  To keep
[3405.18 --> 3405.72]  the end
[3405.72 --> 3406.42]  in view,
[3407.00 --> 3407.86]  to let
[3407.86 --> 3408.94]  the certainty
[3408.94 --> 3409.86]  of death,
[3410.50 --> 3411.24]  the reality
[3411.24 --> 3412.18]  of judgment,
[3412.34 --> 3413.14]  and the return
[3413.14 --> 3413.98]  of Christ
[3413.98 --> 3415.32]  shape how
[3415.32 --> 3415.94]  we live
[3415.94 --> 3416.50]  now.
[3416.50 --> 3418.72]  And that's
[3418.72 --> 3419.08]  why we're
[3419.08 --> 3419.68]  starting this
[3419.68 --> 3420.18]  series at
[3420.18 --> 3420.54]  the end
[3420.54 --> 3420.82]  of the
[3420.82 --> 3421.10]  book,
[3422.10 --> 3423.42]  with Ecclesiastes
[3423.42 --> 3423.94]  12,
[3424.30 --> 3425.38]  18 to
[3425.38 --> 3426.26]  14.
[3427.10 --> 3427.62]  Now,
[3427.70 --> 3428.28]  the Hebrew
[3428.28 --> 3429.22]  title of
[3429.22 --> 3429.78]  this book
[3429.78 --> 3430.86]  is Kohelet.
[3431.74 --> 3432.44]  That's a
[3432.44 --> 3433.30]  Hebrew word
[3433.30 --> 3434.62]  for one
[3434.62 --> 3435.34]  who gathers
[3435.34 --> 3435.94]  the people
[3435.94 --> 3436.52]  to teach
[3436.52 --> 3436.82]  them.
[3438.58 --> 3439.76]  The ancient
[3439.76 --> 3440.66]  Greek translation
[3440.66 --> 3441.86]  of that word
[3441.86 --> 3443.28]  is Ecclesiastes,
[3443.28 --> 3444.68]  which means
[3444.68 --> 3445.18]  a citizen
[3445.18 --> 3445.82]  of the
[3445.82 --> 3446.54]  assembly.
[3446.70 --> 3447.02]  That's where
[3447.02 --> 3447.84]  our title
[3447.84 --> 3448.44]  for this
[3448.44 --> 3449.08]  book comes.
[3449.22 --> 3449.82]  Ecclesiastes
[3449.82 --> 3450.24]  is the
[3450.24 --> 3450.44]  Greek
[3450.44 --> 3451.04]  translation
[3451.04 --> 3452.28]  of the
[3452.28 --> 3452.58]  Hebrew
[3452.58 --> 3453.04]  word
[3453.04 --> 3453.86]  Kohelet.
[3454.26 --> 3454.72]  Martin
[3454.72 --> 3455.18]  Luther,
[3455.56 --> 3456.08]  16th
[3456.08 --> 3456.46]  century
[3456.46 --> 3457.28]  reformer,
[3457.46 --> 3458.10]  translated
[3458.10 --> 3459.30]  Kohelet
[3459.30 --> 3460.06]  as the
[3460.06 --> 3460.48]  preacher.
[3461.66 --> 3462.32]  The NIV,
[3462.78 --> 3463.18]  which we
[3463.18 --> 3463.48]  read,
[3463.66 --> 3464.38]  translates it
[3464.38 --> 3465.10]  as the
[3465.10 --> 3465.54]  teacher.
[3467.20 --> 3468.14]  And that's
[3468.14 --> 3468.44]  what's going
[3468.44 --> 3468.92]  on in this
[3468.92 --> 3469.24]  book.
[3470.10 --> 3470.72]  It is a
[3470.72 --> 3471.10]  teacher
[3471.10 --> 3472.32]  showing us
[3472.32 --> 3473.02]  what life
[3473.02 --> 3474.20]  looks like
[3474.20 --> 3474.74]  when you
[3474.74 --> 3475.32]  face
[3475.32 --> 3476.62]  reality
[3476.62 --> 3477.78]  honestly.
[3480.38 --> 3480.98]  Dave
[3480.98 --> 3481.50]  Gibson,
[3481.78 --> 3482.70]  whose book
[3482.70 --> 3483.16]  has helped
[3483.16 --> 3483.70]  shape this
[3483.70 --> 3484.30]  whole series,
[3484.58 --> 3485.18]  the book
[3485.18 --> 3485.52]  is called
[3485.52 --> 3486.26]  Live Life
[3486.26 --> 3486.84]  Backwards,
[3487.28 --> 3488.08]  he writes,
[3488.50 --> 3488.90]  the book
[3488.90 --> 3489.84]  of Ecclesiastes
[3489.84 --> 3490.60]  is one of
[3490.60 --> 3491.26]  God's gifts
[3491.26 --> 3492.00]  to help us
[3492.00 --> 3492.72]  live in
[3492.72 --> 3493.22]  the real
[3493.22 --> 3493.62]  world.
[3495.84 --> 3496.04]  And so
[3496.04 --> 3496.60]  Ecclesiastes
[3496.60 --> 3497.12]  is going to
[3497.12 --> 3497.52]  take us
[3497.52 --> 3497.80]  on a
[3497.80 --> 3498.54]  roller coaster.
[3499.46 --> 3499.82]  It's going
[3499.82 --> 3500.16]  to paint
[3500.16 --> 3500.62]  for us
[3500.62 --> 3501.34]  a picture
[3501.34 --> 3502.00]  of life
[3502.00 --> 3502.42]  in all
[3502.42 --> 3502.68]  of its
[3502.68 --> 3503.10]  beauty
[3503.10 --> 3504.30]  and sorrow,
[3504.54 --> 3504.84]  in all
[3504.84 --> 3505.12]  of its
[3505.12 --> 3505.58]  joy
[3505.58 --> 3506.66]  and frustration,
[3507.04 --> 3507.36]  in all
[3507.36 --> 3507.60]  of its
[3507.60 --> 3508.28]  questions
[3508.28 --> 3509.66]  and enigmas.
[3511.58 --> 3512.14]  The
[3512.14 --> 3512.50]  teacher
[3512.50 --> 3513.40]  looks at
[3513.40 --> 3513.94]  life,
[3514.32 --> 3514.54]  he looks
[3514.54 --> 3515.32]  at experience,
[3515.52 --> 3515.74]  he looks
[3515.74 --> 3516.34]  at time,
[3516.44 --> 3516.70]  he looks
[3516.70 --> 3517.20]  at trouble,
[3517.50 --> 3517.86]  the teacher
[3517.86 --> 3518.46]  looks at
[3518.46 --> 3519.10]  what seems
[3519.10 --> 3520.08]  to him
[3520.08 --> 3520.62]  to be
[3520.62 --> 3521.60]  deterministic
[3521.60 --> 3522.14]  forces
[3522.14 --> 3523.32]  like fate
[3523.32 --> 3525.02]  and can
[3525.02 --> 3525.76]  only
[3525.76 --> 3526.52]  conclude
[3526.52 --> 3527.90]  that all
[3527.90 --> 3528.60]  is
[3528.60 --> 3529.50]  meaningless.
[3530.46 --> 3531.18]  Meaningless,
[3531.46 --> 3532.12]  says the
[3532.12 --> 3532.54]  teacher.
[3533.00 --> 3533.52]  Everything
[3533.52 --> 3534.56]  is
[3534.56 --> 3535.48]  meaningless.
[3537.48 --> 3538.40]  Havel
[3538.40 --> 3539.52]  in Hebrew.
[3540.78 --> 3541.24]  An older
[3541.24 --> 3542.02]  translation of
[3542.02 --> 3542.22]  that,
[3542.70 --> 3543.12]  vanity,
[3544.26 --> 3544.82]  vanity
[3544.82 --> 3545.42]  of
[3545.42 --> 3546.32]  vanities,
[3547.78 --> 3548.26]  enigma,
[3549.22 --> 3549.56]  vapor.
[3549.56 --> 3549.68]  power.
[3551.44 --> 3552.66]  But all
[3552.66 --> 3553.70]  of that
[3553.70 --> 3555.74]  meaninglessness
[3555.74 --> 3557.26]  in the book
[3557.26 --> 3558.30]  of Ecclesiastes
[3558.30 --> 3559.98]  is held
[3559.98 --> 3561.06]  against and
[3561.06 --> 3562.32]  alongside of
[3562.32 --> 3563.36]  this sort
[3563.36 --> 3565.08]  of carpe diem
[3565.08 --> 3566.42]  belief in
[3566.42 --> 3567.42]  the goodness
[3567.42 --> 3568.24]  of creation
[3568.24 --> 3568.90]  and the
[3568.90 --> 3569.40]  goodness of
[3569.40 --> 3569.76]  life.
[3570.64 --> 3570.98]  Throughout,
[3571.14 --> 3571.32]  you get
[3571.32 --> 3571.70]  meaningless,
[3571.88 --> 3572.08]  meaningless,
[3572.24 --> 3572.56]  but then you
[3572.56 --> 3572.98]  also get
[3572.98 --> 3573.46]  eat,
[3573.64 --> 3573.88]  drink,
[3573.98 --> 3574.18]  and be
[3574.18 --> 3574.54]  merry.
[3574.54 --> 3576.84]  Right?
[3576.98 --> 3577.50]  Vanity
[3577.50 --> 3577.80]  of
[3577.80 --> 3578.32]  vanities
[3578.32 --> 3579.22]  and celebrate
[3579.22 --> 3580.50]  life.
[3582.42 --> 3582.70]  And so
[3582.70 --> 3583.14]  there's this
[3583.14 --> 3584.16]  meaninglessness
[3584.16 --> 3585.02]  and this
[3585.02 --> 3586.14]  nihilism
[3586.14 --> 3587.46]  that's always
[3587.46 --> 3588.82]  held against
[3588.82 --> 3590.20]  this persistent
[3590.20 --> 3591.44]  belief in a
[3591.44 --> 3592.12]  good God
[3592.12 --> 3592.82]  and a good
[3592.82 --> 3593.50]  creation.
[3593.98 --> 3595.16]  A persistent
[3595.16 --> 3596.20]  idea that
[3596.20 --> 3597.02]  there must be
[3597.02 --> 3597.96]  more to life
[3597.96 --> 3598.42]  than this
[3598.42 --> 3598.80]  struggle.
[3602.58 --> 3603.52]  What do you
[3603.52 --> 3603.96]  do
[3603.96 --> 3606.22]  when your
[3606.22 --> 3607.14]  experience
[3607.14 --> 3608.06]  challenges
[3608.06 --> 3609.82]  the belief
[3609.82 --> 3610.26]  in the
[3610.26 --> 3610.78]  goodness of
[3610.78 --> 3611.14]  life?
[3614.50 --> 3615.44]  What do
[3615.44 --> 3615.84]  you do
[3615.84 --> 3616.80]  when your
[3616.80 --> 3617.54]  experience
[3617.54 --> 3618.32]  is full
[3618.32 --> 3619.54]  of hardship
[3619.54 --> 3620.60]  and pain
[3620.60 --> 3621.56]  and hurt
[3621.56 --> 3623.24]  but somehow,
[3623.82 --> 3624.50]  some way,
[3624.80 --> 3625.44]  in that
[3625.44 --> 3626.22]  very same
[3626.22 --> 3626.80]  heart,
[3627.18 --> 3627.92]  is this
[3627.92 --> 3628.96]  ongoing
[3628.96 --> 3630.10]  persistence
[3630.10 --> 3631.62]  and imagination?
[3633.26 --> 3633.36]  Right?
[3633.36 --> 3634.18]  Even asking
[3634.18 --> 3634.96]  the question,
[3635.36 --> 3635.76]  what is
[3635.76 --> 3636.32]  the point?
[3637.48 --> 3637.66]  Right?
[3637.66 --> 3638.06]  Even that
[3638.06 --> 3639.20]  question rests
[3639.20 --> 3639.78]  on the
[3639.78 --> 3640.30]  assumption
[3640.30 --> 3641.14]  that there
[3641.14 --> 3642.02]  should be
[3642.02 --> 3642.62]  that there
[3642.62 --> 3643.36]  is a
[3643.36 --> 3643.72]  point
[3643.72 --> 3645.30]  and that
[3645.30 --> 3645.76]  the point
[3645.76 --> 3646.38]  ought to be
[3646.38 --> 3646.72]  good.
[3648.00 --> 3648.50]  Right?
[3648.54 --> 3649.02]  In this
[3649.02 --> 3649.50]  way,
[3649.50 --> 3650.26]  in exactly
[3650.26 --> 3650.78]  this way,
[3650.94 --> 3651.74]  Ecclesiastes
[3651.74 --> 3653.00]  is the
[3653.00 --> 3653.58]  book for
[3653.58 --> 3654.06]  a time
[3654.06 --> 3654.70]  such as
[3654.70 --> 3655.36]  this.
[3657.84 --> 3658.64]  And it
[3658.64 --> 3659.12]  is
[3659.12 --> 3660.78]  because it
[3660.78 --> 3661.76]  drives us
[3661.76 --> 3662.60]  back
[3662.60 --> 3663.88]  to God.
[3665.48 --> 3666.44]  To put it
[3666.44 --> 3666.94]  in sort of
[3666.94 --> 3667.32]  modern
[3667.32 --> 3667.94]  language,
[3668.74 --> 3669.60]  Ecclesiastes
[3669.60 --> 3670.06]  will
[3670.06 --> 3670.92]  de-center
[3670.92 --> 3671.60]  you
[3671.60 --> 3673.20]  and re-center
[3673.20 --> 3673.60]  him.
[3675.26 --> 3675.96]  Ecclesiastes
[3675.96 --> 3676.74]  is a project
[3676.74 --> 3677.78]  of de-centering,
[3678.42 --> 3679.42]  of challenging
[3679.42 --> 3680.24]  our assumptions
[3680.24 --> 3680.86]  about how
[3680.86 --> 3681.38]  the world
[3681.38 --> 3682.14]  works and
[3682.14 --> 3682.58]  about what
[3682.58 --> 3683.02]  works in
[3683.02 --> 3683.44]  the world.
[3684.38 --> 3684.92]  Removing
[3684.92 --> 3685.52]  ourselves
[3685.52 --> 3686.10]  from the
[3686.10 --> 3686.42]  center
[3686.42 --> 3687.34]  of our
[3687.34 --> 3687.64]  little
[3687.64 --> 3688.10]  worlds
[3688.10 --> 3688.58]  as the
[3688.58 --> 3689.14]  arbiters
[3689.14 --> 3689.92]  and discerners
[3689.92 --> 3690.22]  of what
[3690.22 --> 3690.60]  is true
[3690.60 --> 3691.22]  and good
[3691.22 --> 3691.78]  and beautiful
[3691.78 --> 3693.12]  and re-centering
[3693.12 --> 3693.94]  the creator,
[3694.36 --> 3695.10]  God himself,
[3695.34 --> 3695.78]  as the
[3695.78 --> 3696.32]  ultimate,
[3696.52 --> 3697.46]  capital T,
[3697.92 --> 3698.28]  true,
[3698.70 --> 3699.18]  good,
[3699.18 --> 3700.08]  and beautiful.
[3701.46 --> 3702.22]  And this
[3702.22 --> 3702.78]  is important.
[3703.78 --> 3704.48]  I love the
[3704.48 --> 3704.86]  way that
[3704.86 --> 3705.58]  John Welch
[3705.58 --> 3706.58]  puts it.
[3707.00 --> 3707.44]  He says,
[3708.42 --> 3708.90]  centering
[3708.90 --> 3709.68]  our life
[3709.68 --> 3710.54]  on God
[3710.54 --> 3711.72]  does not
[3711.72 --> 3712.50]  rob us
[3712.50 --> 3713.06]  of our
[3713.06 --> 3713.94]  personality,
[3714.84 --> 3715.52]  but it
[3715.52 --> 3715.94]  guarantees
[3715.94 --> 3716.46]  it.
[3718.72 --> 3719.40]  Ecclesiastes
[3719.40 --> 3720.04]  wants you
[3720.04 --> 3720.62]  to see
[3720.62 --> 3721.52]  that your
[3721.52 --> 3722.20]  true
[3722.20 --> 3723.26]  humanity,
[3723.76 --> 3724.22]  who you
[3724.22 --> 3725.08]  really are
[3725.08 --> 3725.94]  supposed to
[3725.94 --> 3726.46]  be,
[3727.20 --> 3728.42]  by showing
[3728.42 --> 3729.04]  you God.
[3729.18 --> 3731.02]  by showing
[3731.02 --> 3731.40]  you who
[3731.40 --> 3731.98]  God is.
[3733.66 --> 3734.10]  That's why
[3734.10 --> 3734.52]  I believe
[3734.52 --> 3734.88]  that this
[3734.88 --> 3735.30]  book is
[3735.30 --> 3735.82]  important for
[3735.82 --> 3736.34]  this moment
[3736.34 --> 3737.18]  right now.
[3737.30 --> 3737.80]  It's because
[3737.80 --> 3738.24]  of this
[3738.24 --> 3738.70]  idea.
[3739.54 --> 3739.92]  And I
[3739.92 --> 3740.38]  believe it
[3740.38 --> 3740.90]  is important
[3740.90 --> 3741.86]  because it
[3741.86 --> 3743.16]  goes straight
[3743.16 --> 3744.32]  to what
[3744.32 --> 3745.02]  most of
[3745.02 --> 3745.62]  us in
[3745.62 --> 3746.50]  our lives
[3746.50 --> 3747.30]  avoid.
[3748.92 --> 3749.86]  The ultimate
[3749.86 --> 3750.50]  destination,
[3751.32 --> 3752.10]  the ultimate
[3752.10 --> 3752.74]  purpose,
[3753.98 --> 3754.20]  the very
[3754.20 --> 3754.96]  end for
[3754.96 --> 3756.02]  which we
[3756.02 --> 3756.40]  exist.
[3757.36 --> 3758.12]  The teacher
[3758.12 --> 3758.98]  cuts through
[3758.98 --> 3759.24]  that
[3759.24 --> 3759.72]  noise.
[3761.74 --> 3762.40]  He insists
[3762.40 --> 3762.90]  that the
[3762.90 --> 3764.14]  end, and
[3764.14 --> 3764.86]  not progress
[3764.86 --> 3765.30]  or not
[3765.30 --> 3766.10]  self-fulfillment,
[3766.32 --> 3767.08]  not comfort,
[3767.34 --> 3767.92]  not your
[3767.92 --> 3769.20]  control, but
[3769.20 --> 3770.20]  the end is
[3770.20 --> 3770.76]  what makes
[3770.76 --> 3771.64]  sense of the
[3771.64 --> 3772.38]  journey along
[3772.38 --> 3772.72]  the way.
[3773.90 --> 3774.54]  And so, like
[3774.54 --> 3775.06]  we said, we're
[3775.06 --> 3775.98]  beginning at
[3775.98 --> 3776.42]  the end.
[3776.86 --> 3777.56]  And at the
[3777.56 --> 3778.98]  end, Ecclesiastes
[3778.98 --> 3780.60]  lays out for
[3780.60 --> 3781.72]  us four
[3781.72 --> 3783.36]  interlocking
[3783.36 --> 3784.44]  realities.
[3784.44 --> 3784.74]  keys.
[3785.90 --> 3786.60]  The first
[3786.60 --> 3787.58]  is to see
[3787.58 --> 3788.20]  that life
[3788.20 --> 3789.56]  is enigma,
[3790.56 --> 3791.24]  it's fragile,
[3791.50 --> 3792.12]  it's fleeting,
[3792.22 --> 3792.96]  it's havel.
[3793.60 --> 3794.50]  Second, to
[3794.50 --> 3795.44]  see that God's
[3795.44 --> 3796.34]  word both
[3796.34 --> 3797.38]  delights and
[3797.38 --> 3798.44]  corrects in the
[3798.44 --> 3798.98]  midst of that.
[3799.04 --> 3800.02]  It guides and
[3800.02 --> 3801.60]  at times, to use
[3801.60 --> 3802.04]  the language of
[3802.04 --> 3802.50]  the text, it
[3802.50 --> 3803.92]  painfully goads
[3803.92 --> 3805.36]  back onto the
[3805.36 --> 3806.02]  safe path.
[3806.58 --> 3807.52]  Third, to see
[3807.52 --> 3808.24]  that our proper
[3808.24 --> 3809.24]  response is
[3809.24 --> 3810.48]  summarized in the
[3810.48 --> 3811.86]  teacher's call to
[3811.86 --> 3812.86]  fear God and
[3812.86 --> 3813.34]  keep his
[3813.34 --> 3813.76]  commands.
[3814.14 --> 3814.38]  And then
[3814.38 --> 3815.18]  finally, last
[3815.18 --> 3816.08]  we will end
[3816.08 --> 3817.74]  this morning, is
[3817.74 --> 3819.40]  to see that the
[3819.40 --> 3820.74]  decisive reality
[3820.74 --> 3821.96]  that makes all
[3821.96 --> 3823.06]  of this urgent
[3823.06 --> 3825.40]  is the truth of
[3825.40 --> 3827.12]  death and
[3827.12 --> 3829.18]  judgment in the
[3829.18 --> 3829.88]  face of Christ's
[3829.88 --> 3830.14]  return.
[3831.22 --> 3832.00]  The book
[3832.00 --> 3833.02]  closes, right,
[3833.08 --> 3833.34]  with an
[3833.34 --> 3834.34]  uncompromising
[3834.34 --> 3834.76]  note.
[3835.40 --> 3836.02]  Verse 14,
[3836.36 --> 3837.00]  and God will
[3837.00 --> 3837.84]  bring every
[3837.84 --> 3838.72]  deed into
[3838.72 --> 3839.26]  judgment,
[3839.48 --> 3840.52]  including every
[3840.52 --> 3841.18]  hidden thing,
[3841.18 --> 3841.94]  whether it is
[3841.94 --> 3842.94]  good or
[3842.94 --> 3843.30]  evil.
[3846.74 --> 3847.56]  If the
[3847.56 --> 3848.68]  end is
[3848.68 --> 3849.20]  judgment,
[3850.04 --> 3851.62]  then our
[3851.62 --> 3852.90]  present decisions,
[3853.58 --> 3854.22]  our present
[3854.22 --> 3855.32]  moment, is
[3855.32 --> 3855.92]  not trivial.
[3856.92 --> 3858.04]  It matters.
[3859.18 --> 3860.56]  Living backwards
[3860.56 --> 3861.70]  means letting
[3861.70 --> 3862.72]  that final
[3862.72 --> 3863.56]  courtroom of
[3863.56 --> 3864.62]  God shape how
[3864.62 --> 3865.58]  we work and
[3865.58 --> 3866.46]  how we love and
[3866.46 --> 3867.84]  how we speak and
[3867.84 --> 3868.74]  how we suffer
[3868.74 --> 3869.44]  today.
[3871.18 --> 3872.00]  To live
[3872.00 --> 3873.42]  wisely is to
[3873.42 --> 3873.92]  let the
[3873.92 --> 3874.78]  certainty of
[3874.78 --> 3875.34]  death and
[3875.34 --> 3876.84]  the reality of
[3876.84 --> 3877.70]  final judgment
[3877.70 --> 3878.62]  shape your
[3878.62 --> 3879.04]  present.
[3880.26 --> 3881.08]  Fear God,
[3881.22 --> 3881.80]  obey His
[3881.80 --> 3882.16]  commands,
[3882.54 --> 3883.50]  live in light
[3883.50 --> 3884.56]  of the end.
[3885.48 --> 3886.00]  That's our big
[3886.00 --> 3887.32]  idea for today
[3887.32 --> 3888.12]  and it will be
[3888.12 --> 3888.96]  seen throughout.
[3889.80 --> 3891.08]  To live wisely,
[3891.28 --> 3891.98]  we must live
[3891.98 --> 3892.74]  backward.
[3893.68 --> 3894.20]  Death and
[3894.20 --> 3894.82]  judgment are
[3894.82 --> 3896.00]  certain, so we
[3896.00 --> 3897.76]  fear God and
[3897.76 --> 3898.16]  keep His
[3898.16 --> 3898.54]  commands.
[3898.54 --> 3901.30]  to help us
[3901.30 --> 3901.84]  keep this in
[3901.84 --> 3903.90]  view, we're
[3903.90 --> 3904.60]  starting this
[3904.60 --> 3906.50]  series with
[3906.50 --> 3907.82]  the end so
[3907.82 --> 3908.40]  that we can
[3908.40 --> 3908.92]  know the
[3908.92 --> 3909.88]  conclusions at
[3909.88 --> 3911.16]  the outset that
[3911.16 --> 3912.06]  we might apply
[3912.06 --> 3913.18]  them week in
[3913.18 --> 3914.74]  and week out in
[3914.74 --> 3915.92]  anticipation of
[3915.92 --> 3917.82]  the struggles that
[3917.82 --> 3918.88]  the teacher will
[3918.88 --> 3919.54]  take us through.
[3922.28 --> 3923.24]  Now, verse 8,
[3923.36 --> 3924.12]  where we started,
[3924.24 --> 3925.06]  of chapter 12,
[3925.06 --> 3927.66]  then, is the
[3927.66 --> 3928.60]  sort of banner
[3928.60 --> 3930.64]  frame of the
[3930.64 --> 3930.92]  book.
[3931.88 --> 3932.94]  When you think,
[3933.10 --> 3933.64]  what is
[3933.64 --> 3934.46]  Ecclesiastes
[3934.46 --> 3935.00]  about?
[3935.30 --> 3936.20]  This line,
[3936.44 --> 3936.84]  meaningless,
[3937.10 --> 3937.44]  meaningless,
[3937.66 --> 3938.12]  says the
[3938.12 --> 3938.44]  teacher,
[3938.60 --> 3939.84]  everything is
[3939.84 --> 3940.30]  meaningless,
[3940.48 --> 3941.06]  or vanity,
[3941.62 --> 3942.00]  vanity,
[3942.32 --> 3943.26]  everything is
[3943.26 --> 3943.86]  vanity,
[3944.06 --> 3944.72]  or all of
[3944.72 --> 3945.42]  life is
[3945.42 --> 3946.18]  vanity.
[3946.42 --> 3947.46]  This refrain
[3947.46 --> 3949.38]  persists.
[3949.38 --> 3951.52]  Now, this
[3951.52 --> 3952.04]  word,
[3952.38 --> 3952.80]  meaningless,
[3953.46 --> 3954.22]  people have
[3954.22 --> 3954.96]  suggested many
[3954.96 --> 3955.54]  different ways
[3955.54 --> 3956.32]  to translate
[3956.32 --> 3957.00]  that word.
[3957.88 --> 3958.32]  Some people
[3958.32 --> 3958.74]  have used
[3958.74 --> 3959.12]  vanity,
[3959.46 --> 3959.88]  some people
[3959.88 --> 3960.36]  have used
[3960.36 --> 3961.32]  vapor.
[3961.48 --> 3961.86]  I had a
[3961.86 --> 3962.20]  preaching
[3962.20 --> 3963.12]  professor in
[3963.12 --> 3964.22]  seminary who
[3964.22 --> 3965.06]  said, you
[3965.06 --> 3965.98]  can't translate
[3965.98 --> 3966.94]  this word with
[3966.94 --> 3967.56]  another word,
[3967.64 --> 3968.06]  you need to
[3968.06 --> 3968.74]  translate it with
[3968.74 --> 3969.36]  a sound,
[3969.46 --> 3969.86]  and he would
[3969.86 --> 3970.04]  go,
[3970.04 --> 3973.58]  because it
[3973.58 --> 3974.82]  just disappears.
[3974.82 --> 3978.72]  Psalm 39,
[3979.02 --> 3980.30]  verse 5 and
[3980.30 --> 3980.74]  6,
[3981.62 --> 3982.36]  says the
[3982.36 --> 3982.66]  following,
[3983.66 --> 3984.94]  the span of
[3984.94 --> 3986.02]  my years is
[3986.02 --> 3986.64]  as nothing
[3986.64 --> 3987.36]  before you.
[3988.22 --> 3989.48]  Everything is
[3989.48 --> 3990.02]  but a
[3990.02 --> 3990.52]  breath,
[3991.38 --> 3991.66]  Havel.
[3993.08 --> 3993.60]  Surely
[3993.60 --> 3994.66]  everyone goes
[3994.66 --> 3995.44]  about like a
[3995.44 --> 3996.36]  mere phantom
[3996.36 --> 3997.58]  in vain,
[3998.04 --> 3998.48]  Havel,
[3998.84 --> 3999.56]  they rush
[3999.56 --> 4000.02]  about,
[4000.56 --> 4001.04]  keeping up
[4001.04 --> 4001.40]  wealth.
[4002.54 --> 4002.92]  Proverbs
[4002.92 --> 4003.58]  31,
[4003.82 --> 4004.34]  30,
[4004.52 --> 4004.72]  says,
[4004.82 --> 4005.64]  charm is
[4005.64 --> 4006.64]  deceptive
[4006.64 --> 4007.64]  and beauty
[4007.64 --> 4009.14]  is fleeting.
[4010.16 --> 4010.56]  Havel.
[4012.10 --> 4012.66]  There's
[4012.66 --> 4013.44]  something in
[4013.44 --> 4014.34]  this word,
[4014.72 --> 4015.24]  there's
[4015.24 --> 4015.84]  something of
[4015.84 --> 4016.68]  a recognition
[4016.68 --> 4017.78]  that life
[4017.78 --> 4019.20]  and meaning
[4019.20 --> 4020.46]  are elusive,
[4021.14 --> 4021.60]  that they're
[4021.60 --> 4022.08]  hard to
[4022.08 --> 4022.54]  grasp,
[4023.06 --> 4023.38]  they are
[4023.38 --> 4024.50]  that wisp
[4024.50 --> 4025.42]  of smoke
[4025.42 --> 4026.24]  that you
[4026.24 --> 4026.64]  try to
[4026.64 --> 4027.08]  reach out
[4027.08 --> 4027.40]  to it,
[4027.46 --> 4027.74]  to lay
[4027.74 --> 4028.16]  hold of
[4028.16 --> 4028.28]  it,
[4028.34 --> 4028.74]  to grab
[4028.74 --> 4028.90]  it,
[4029.00 --> 4029.32]  and then
[4029.32 --> 4029.66]  you open
[4029.66 --> 4030.02]  your hand
[4030.02 --> 4030.42]  to look
[4030.42 --> 4030.72]  at it,
[4030.76 --> 4031.02]  and there's
[4031.02 --> 4031.26]  nothing
[4031.26 --> 4031.54]  there.
[4034.82 --> 4036.72]  life can
[4036.72 --> 4037.34]  feel that
[4037.34 --> 4037.60]  way.
[4040.48 --> 4041.14]  And it's
[4041.14 --> 4041.50]  not that
[4041.50 --> 4042.24]  life is
[4042.24 --> 4042.74]  meaningless,
[4043.54 --> 4043.94]  in the
[4043.94 --> 4045.02]  literal sense,
[4045.08 --> 4045.46]  it's that
[4045.46 --> 4046.36]  the meaning
[4046.36 --> 4047.64]  is hard to
[4047.64 --> 4048.22]  grab hold
[4048.22 --> 4048.50]  of,
[4048.72 --> 4049.48]  it's hard to
[4049.48 --> 4050.06]  figure out,
[4050.28 --> 4050.86]  it's hard to
[4050.86 --> 4051.44]  see how it
[4051.44 --> 4051.84]  can apply
[4051.84 --> 4052.22]  here,
[4052.36 --> 4052.92]  and here,
[4053.10 --> 4053.66]  and here,
[4053.78 --> 4054.36]  and here.
[4054.36 --> 4056.60]  somehow,
[4056.86 --> 4057.36]  this meaning
[4057.36 --> 4057.72]  that we
[4057.72 --> 4058.68]  know exists
[4058.68 --> 4059.68]  is beyond
[4059.68 --> 4060.78]  our comprehension.
[4061.94 --> 4062.72]  That's why I
[4062.72 --> 4063.42]  like the word
[4063.42 --> 4063.80]  in the
[4063.80 --> 4064.34]  translation
[4064.34 --> 4065.24]  enigma.
[4066.50 --> 4067.26]  That's from
[4067.26 --> 4068.38]  Craig Bartholomew,
[4068.46 --> 4068.76]  whom I
[4068.76 --> 4069.18]  studied
[4069.18 --> 4070.58]  underneath
[4070.58 --> 4071.60]  in university,
[4072.18 --> 4072.62]  and who's
[4072.62 --> 4073.18]  probably written
[4073.18 --> 4073.74]  the definitive
[4073.74 --> 4074.46]  commentary,
[4075.22 --> 4075.78]  or contemporary
[4075.78 --> 4076.30]  commentary,
[4076.48 --> 4076.68]  anyway,
[4076.80 --> 4077.66]  on Ecclesiastes.
[4079.44 --> 4080.04]  But,
[4080.12 --> 4080.90]  already back
[4080.90 --> 4081.34]  in the
[4081.34 --> 4083.24]  15th and
[4083.24 --> 4083.84]  16th
[4083.84 --> 4084.40]  centuries,
[4085.20 --> 4085.50]  in the
[4085.50 --> 4085.90]  history of
[4085.90 --> 4086.40]  the church,
[4086.92 --> 4087.50]  there was a
[4087.50 --> 4087.92]  bit of a
[4087.92 --> 4089.34]  resurgence in
[4089.34 --> 4090.16]  the study of
[4090.16 --> 4091.40]  Ecclesiastes for
[4091.40 --> 4091.86]  the life of
[4091.86 --> 4092.32]  the church.
[4093.32 --> 4093.66]  And Martin
[4093.66 --> 4094.26]  Luther and
[4094.26 --> 4094.58]  the other
[4094.58 --> 4095.40]  reformers
[4095.40 --> 4096.48]  helped us
[4096.48 --> 4097.32]  to see
[4097.32 --> 4098.34]  that Havel
[4098.34 --> 4099.54]  isn't
[4099.54 --> 4100.72]  itself about
[4100.72 --> 4101.96]  the created
[4101.96 --> 4102.86]  order as
[4102.86 --> 4103.54]  being meaningless,
[4103.80 --> 4104.42]  or to
[4104.42 --> 4105.98]  espouse a
[4105.98 --> 4106.26]  sort of
[4106.26 --> 4107.24]  contempt for
[4107.24 --> 4107.82]  the world,
[4108.14 --> 4108.80]  but to
[4108.80 --> 4109.54]  see that
[4109.54 --> 4110.00]  it's about
[4110.00 --> 4110.72]  the heart,
[4111.28 --> 4112.02]  the seat
[4112.02 --> 4112.96]  of your
[4112.96 --> 4113.46]  and my
[4113.46 --> 4114.30]  emotions
[4114.30 --> 4115.76]  and desires,
[4116.36 --> 4116.94]  and our
[4116.94 --> 4117.64]  wayward
[4117.64 --> 4118.68]  appetites,
[4118.94 --> 4119.26]  and then
[4119.26 --> 4120.48]  the misuse
[4120.48 --> 4121.52]  of creation
[4121.52 --> 4123.18]  that results
[4123.18 --> 4124.28]  in the
[4124.28 --> 4125.26]  good creation
[4125.26 --> 4126.32]  being subject
[4126.32 --> 4128.06]  to this
[4128.06 --> 4129.42]  Havel,
[4129.62 --> 4130.92]  this vanity,
[4131.20 --> 4132.42]  this enigma.
[4134.12 --> 4134.86]  And it's in
[4134.86 --> 4136.42]  and through
[4136.42 --> 4137.38]  the desires
[4137.38 --> 4138.06]  of my
[4138.06 --> 4139.08]  wayward heart
[4139.08 --> 4139.80]  that finding
[4139.80 --> 4141.12]  meaning in
[4141.12 --> 4141.74]  the things
[4141.74 --> 4142.22]  of the
[4142.22 --> 4143.02]  world is
[4143.02 --> 4143.56]  hard,
[4143.66 --> 4143.84]  albeit
[4143.84 --> 4144.84]  impossible,
[4145.34 --> 4146.52]  because the
[4146.52 --> 4147.00]  things of
[4147.00 --> 4147.64]  this world
[4147.64 --> 4149.16]  are always
[4149.16 --> 4149.70]  changing.
[4150.62 --> 4151.12]  Right?
[4151.20 --> 4151.44]  They're
[4151.44 --> 4151.88]  fleeting,
[4152.34 --> 4152.98]  they're
[4152.98 --> 4153.42]  moving,
[4153.58 --> 4153.80]  they're
[4153.80 --> 4154.70]  transitory,
[4155.16 --> 4156.06]  and purpose
[4156.06 --> 4156.70]  and meaning
[4156.70 --> 4157.32]  can't be
[4157.32 --> 4159.12]  fixed if
[4159.12 --> 4159.94]  the source
[4159.94 --> 4160.48]  of purpose
[4160.48 --> 4160.94]  and meaning
[4160.94 --> 4162.26]  is itself
[4162.26 --> 4163.16]  mutable,
[4163.26 --> 4163.66]  if it's
[4163.66 --> 4164.34]  changing.
[4165.72 --> 4166.68]  Meaning and
[4166.68 --> 4167.34]  purpose can
[4167.34 --> 4168.18]  only be
[4168.18 --> 4169.38]  fixed if
[4169.38 --> 4170.14]  the source
[4170.14 --> 4170.66]  of our
[4170.66 --> 4171.00]  meaning,
[4171.14 --> 4171.62]  the source
[4171.62 --> 4171.98]  of our
[4171.98 --> 4172.54]  purpose is
[4172.54 --> 4173.22]  immutable,
[4173.48 --> 4174.74]  is unchanging
[4174.74 --> 4176.32]  like God
[4176.32 --> 4177.00]  is.
[4179.82 --> 4180.56]  But you
[4180.56 --> 4181.06]  guys know,
[4182.34 --> 4182.80]  right, our
[4182.80 --> 4183.98]  hearts chase
[4183.98 --> 4184.54]  after other
[4184.54 --> 4185.04]  ideas,
[4186.10 --> 4186.76]  other things,
[4187.38 --> 4188.08]  and it's
[4188.08 --> 4188.44]  because of
[4188.44 --> 4189.52]  that that
[4189.52 --> 4190.58]  these enigmas
[4190.58 --> 4191.56]  of life
[4191.56 --> 4192.94]  challenge us.
[4193.76 --> 4194.34]  Again, it's
[4194.34 --> 4194.94]  not that life
[4194.94 --> 4196.10]  has no meaning,
[4196.28 --> 4196.74]  it's that the
[4196.74 --> 4197.52]  meaning is often
[4197.52 --> 4197.98]  beyond our
[4197.98 --> 4198.40]  grasp.
[4199.36 --> 4200.18]  Life is a
[4200.18 --> 4201.78]  gift, but
[4201.78 --> 4202.06]  it is
[4202.06 --> 4203.36]  fleeting, it
[4203.36 --> 4204.14]  is mysterious,
[4204.64 --> 4205.42]  and sometimes
[4205.42 --> 4206.96]  it is painfully
[4206.96 --> 4208.14]  elusive.
[4210.02 --> 4210.34]  Jacques
[4210.34 --> 4211.82]  Ellul, he
[4211.82 --> 4212.60]  captures it
[4212.60 --> 4214.22]  perfectly in
[4214.22 --> 4214.76]  his comments
[4214.76 --> 4215.70]  on Ecclesiastes,
[4215.94 --> 4216.54]  he says,
[4216.90 --> 4217.80]  in reality,
[4218.18 --> 4218.88]  all is
[4218.88 --> 4219.40]  vanity.
[4220.72 --> 4221.40]  In truth,
[4221.94 --> 4223.18]  everything is
[4223.18 --> 4223.62]  a gift of
[4223.62 --> 4223.88]  God.
[4225.36 --> 4226.06]  That's the
[4226.06 --> 4226.36]  struggle.
[4227.52 --> 4228.76]  Life and
[4228.76 --> 4229.92]  meaning is
[4229.92 --> 4230.58]  enigmatic.
[4232.30 --> 4232.70]  And so,
[4232.90 --> 4233.80]  given that,
[4234.16 --> 4235.58]  we need our
[4235.58 --> 4236.64]  second point
[4236.64 --> 4237.10]  today.
[4237.20 --> 4238.08]  We need the
[4238.08 --> 4239.06]  truth that God's
[4239.06 --> 4240.40]  word is both
[4240.40 --> 4241.68]  beautiful and
[4241.68 --> 4242.38]  good.
[4243.46 --> 4243.98]  That's why our
[4243.98 --> 4244.92]  text goes on in
[4244.92 --> 4245.52]  verse 10,
[4246.02 --> 4246.92]  if your Bibles are
[4246.92 --> 4247.84]  open, verse 10
[4247.84 --> 4248.98]  says,
[4249.14 --> 4249.56]  the teacher
[4249.56 --> 4250.68]  searched to find
[4250.68 --> 4251.62]  just the right
[4251.62 --> 4253.08]  words, and what
[4253.08 --> 4253.82]  he wrote was
[4253.82 --> 4255.38]  upright and
[4255.38 --> 4255.64]  true.
[4255.64 --> 4256.48]  Other translations
[4256.48 --> 4257.28]  there say the
[4257.28 --> 4257.94]  teacher searched
[4257.94 --> 4259.16]  to find words
[4259.16 --> 4260.32]  of delight.
[4261.78 --> 4262.40]  There is a
[4262.40 --> 4263.08]  sense of
[4263.08 --> 4264.48]  beauty in
[4264.48 --> 4265.28]  the words
[4265.28 --> 4266.46]  and in the
[4266.46 --> 4267.20]  word of
[4267.20 --> 4267.76]  God.
[4268.96 --> 4270.10]  The way the
[4270.10 --> 4271.12]  Bible actually
[4271.12 --> 4272.18]  works is by
[4272.18 --> 4273.28]  being beautiful
[4273.28 --> 4274.12]  because it is
[4274.12 --> 4275.32]  true, and by
[4275.32 --> 4276.06]  being true
[4276.06 --> 4276.80]  because it is
[4276.80 --> 4277.30]  beautiful.
[4277.30 --> 4277.38]  beautiful.
[4279.22 --> 4279.68]  The belief
[4279.68 --> 4280.34]  that God is
[4280.34 --> 4281.18]  good and his
[4281.18 --> 4282.02]  purposes are
[4282.02 --> 4283.22]  good for me
[4283.22 --> 4284.72]  persists in
[4284.72 --> 4285.40]  the face of
[4285.40 --> 4286.34]  the enigmas of
[4286.34 --> 4287.68]  life when I
[4287.68 --> 4288.78]  recognize that
[4288.78 --> 4290.14]  God's words are
[4290.14 --> 4291.26]  true and
[4291.26 --> 4291.82]  beautiful.
[4291.98 --> 4292.48]  When God's
[4292.48 --> 4293.20]  word becomes
[4293.20 --> 4294.80]  beautiful to me,
[4295.10 --> 4296.28]  the ugliness of
[4296.28 --> 4297.60]  life finds a
[4297.60 --> 4297.92]  balm.
[4300.76 --> 4301.82]  But not only
[4301.82 --> 4302.46]  are God's words
[4302.46 --> 4303.70]  beautiful,
[4304.70 --> 4306.66]  sometimes they are
[4306.66 --> 4307.00]  hard.
[4308.58 --> 4309.06]  Verse 11
[4309.06 --> 4309.44]  says,
[4310.44 --> 4311.16]  the words of
[4311.16 --> 4312.12]  the wise are
[4312.12 --> 4313.60]  like goads.
[4315.10 --> 4315.94]  Now, goads
[4315.94 --> 4317.04]  were instruments
[4317.04 --> 4318.00]  employed by
[4318.00 --> 4318.98]  shepherds and
[4318.98 --> 4320.10]  herders to keep
[4320.10 --> 4321.22]  animals on a
[4321.22 --> 4321.62]  path.
[4321.98 --> 4322.74]  They were long
[4322.74 --> 4324.12]  staffs, sticks,
[4324.32 --> 4325.70]  with sharp nails
[4325.70 --> 4326.94]  on the end that
[4326.94 --> 4327.80]  was used to
[4327.80 --> 4328.68]  poke the animal
[4328.68 --> 4329.66]  on the left or
[4329.66 --> 4330.70]  on the right in
[4330.70 --> 4331.52]  order to steer it
[4331.52 --> 4332.90]  back towards the
[4332.90 --> 4333.10]  middle.
[4333.10 --> 4335.04]  right?
[4335.12 --> 4335.76]  And you're
[4335.76 --> 4336.26]  walking on a
[4336.26 --> 4336.92]  path with a
[4336.92 --> 4337.58]  shepherd and to
[4337.58 --> 4338.62]  the left might
[4338.62 --> 4340.66]  be soft soil that
[4340.66 --> 4342.04]  would give way
[4342.04 --> 4342.78]  underneath the
[4342.78 --> 4343.32]  weight of the
[4343.32 --> 4344.10]  animal and then
[4344.10 --> 4344.72]  the animal would
[4344.72 --> 4346.22]  likely fall down
[4346.22 --> 4347.26]  into the canyon
[4347.26 --> 4348.14]  to its death.
[4348.96 --> 4349.38]  And so the
[4349.38 --> 4349.98]  shepherd would
[4349.98 --> 4351.60]  poke it on the
[4351.60 --> 4352.60]  left in order to
[4352.60 --> 4353.94]  steer it back to
[4353.94 --> 4354.30]  the middle.
[4355.60 --> 4357.02]  A little pain in
[4357.02 --> 4358.86]  the moment in
[4358.86 --> 4359.72]  order to avoid
[4359.72 --> 4361.74]  something worse if
[4361.74 --> 4362.68]  left to its own
[4362.68 --> 4363.14]  devices.
[4365.66 --> 4366.60]  So too the
[4366.60 --> 4367.14]  word of God.
[4368.82 --> 4369.76]  Sometimes the
[4369.76 --> 4370.24]  word of God
[4370.24 --> 4371.10]  cuts us.
[4372.50 --> 4372.92]  Sometimes the
[4372.92 --> 4373.26]  word of God
[4373.26 --> 4374.22]  exposes our
[4374.22 --> 4375.56]  wayward hearts and
[4375.56 --> 4376.82]  for a moment it
[4376.82 --> 4379.02]  might hurt but
[4379.02 --> 4379.68]  it's done to
[4379.68 --> 4381.50]  protect us in
[4381.50 --> 4381.90]  the end.
[4386.40 --> 4387.72]  Proverbs says
[4387.72 --> 4389.72]  that better are
[4389.72 --> 4391.36]  the wounds of a
[4391.36 --> 4391.80]  friend.
[4395.22 --> 4395.88]  In order to
[4395.88 --> 4396.18]  point out
[4396.18 --> 4396.62]  something we
[4396.62 --> 4397.12]  might be blind
[4397.12 --> 4401.26]  to or miss or
[4401.26 --> 4403.38]  refuse to see in
[4403.38 --> 4403.68]  our own
[4403.68 --> 4404.28]  stubbornness.
[4406.08 --> 4406.88]  So too the
[4406.88 --> 4407.08]  word.
[4408.78 --> 4409.12]  And look,
[4409.76 --> 4410.38]  sometimes,
[4410.70 --> 4412.06]  sometimes the
[4412.06 --> 4413.16]  Bible is
[4413.16 --> 4413.62]  offensive.
[4415.50 --> 4416.96]  Especially in a
[4416.96 --> 4417.74]  time and a
[4417.74 --> 4419.14]  culture like this
[4419.14 --> 4420.28]  one that calls
[4420.28 --> 4421.38]  good what the
[4421.38 --> 4421.96]  Bible calls
[4421.96 --> 4422.84]  evil and
[4422.84 --> 4423.70]  calls evil
[4423.70 --> 4424.08]  what the
[4424.08 --> 4424.54]  Bible calls
[4424.54 --> 4424.80]  good.
[4426.18 --> 4427.28]  God's word
[4427.28 --> 4428.90]  will cut up
[4428.90 --> 4429.90]  our modern
[4429.90 --> 4430.64]  ideology.
[4432.08 --> 4433.00]  And when that
[4433.00 --> 4433.88]  happens, the
[4433.88 --> 4434.56]  real temptation
[4434.56 --> 4435.78]  for all of us,
[4436.32 --> 4436.90]  the real
[4436.90 --> 4437.94]  temptation is to
[4437.94 --> 4438.70]  make God's
[4438.70 --> 4439.46]  word mean
[4439.46 --> 4440.48]  something different
[4440.48 --> 4441.26]  than what it
[4441.26 --> 4441.54]  means.
[4443.28 --> 4444.50]  When we don't
[4444.50 --> 4445.06]  like what the
[4445.06 --> 4445.90]  Bible says,
[4446.16 --> 4447.60]  we find ways to
[4447.60 --> 4449.00]  change its meaning
[4449.00 --> 4450.06]  so it lines up
[4450.06 --> 4450.78]  with the world
[4450.78 --> 4451.66]  that we want
[4451.66 --> 4452.28]  to live in.
[4454.46 --> 4455.16]  But what if,
[4455.70 --> 4456.36]  what if instead
[4456.36 --> 4457.20]  of changing the
[4457.20 --> 4457.86]  meaning of the
[4457.86 --> 4460.36]  Bible, we
[4460.36 --> 4460.84]  allowed the
[4460.84 --> 4461.92]  Bible to
[4461.92 --> 4462.98]  change the
[4462.98 --> 4463.46]  meanings we
[4463.46 --> 4463.88]  have made?
[4468.68 --> 4469.34]  Instead of
[4469.34 --> 4469.74]  finding the
[4469.74 --> 4470.48]  Bible offensive,
[4471.48 --> 4472.52]  what if we
[4472.52 --> 4472.98]  obeyed it?
[4472.98 --> 4476.76]  the teacher in
[4476.76 --> 4477.76]  Ecclesiastes has
[4477.76 --> 4479.10]  a hard word for
[4479.10 --> 4480.00]  Christians today,
[4480.08 --> 4480.60]  for people who
[4480.60 --> 4481.34]  read the Bible.
[4481.74 --> 4483.06]  Don't domesticate
[4483.06 --> 4483.60]  your Bibles.
[4485.82 --> 4487.08]  Live in God's
[4487.08 --> 4487.54]  world.
[4488.82 --> 4489.32]  And when the
[4489.32 --> 4490.40]  Bible prods you,
[4490.62 --> 4491.40]  when God's word
[4491.40 --> 4492.36]  goads you,
[4493.24 --> 4494.32]  try moving where
[4494.32 --> 4494.96]  it is pointing.
[4497.00 --> 4498.48]  That's where life
[4498.48 --> 4499.16]  is found.
[4501.92 --> 4502.32]  Instead,
[4502.72 --> 4503.26]  though, we
[4503.26 --> 4504.32]  try to goad
[4504.32 --> 4504.88]  the word of
[4504.88 --> 4505.66]  God to make
[4505.66 --> 4506.08]  it mean what
[4506.08 --> 4506.58]  we want it
[4506.58 --> 4506.78]  to.
[4509.08 --> 4509.64]  Instead of
[4509.64 --> 4510.08]  that, let's
[4510.08 --> 4511.76]  move with
[4511.76 --> 4513.10]  him towards
[4513.10 --> 4513.76]  the heart of
[4513.76 --> 4516.36]  God and
[4516.36 --> 4517.54]  see if that
[4517.54 --> 4518.66]  is how we
[4518.66 --> 4519.30]  find beauty
[4519.30 --> 4520.64]  in the word,
[4521.34 --> 4522.10]  how we find
[4522.10 --> 4522.98]  beauty in this
[4522.98 --> 4523.42]  life.
[4524.90 --> 4525.02]  Right?
[4525.14 --> 4526.26]  God always
[4526.26 --> 4527.74]  goads towards
[4527.74 --> 4528.66]  the beauty of
[4528.66 --> 4530.40]  himself and
[4530.40 --> 4531.00]  the beauty of
[4531.00 --> 4532.12]  life lived in
[4532.12 --> 4532.84]  his truth.
[4535.22 --> 4536.02]  Which brings
[4536.02 --> 4537.36]  us to
[4537.36 --> 4538.90]  verse 13.
[4539.80 --> 4539.94]  Right?
[4540.04 --> 4540.96]  Here is the
[4540.96 --> 4541.28]  truth.
[4541.44 --> 4542.38]  Here is the
[4542.38 --> 4543.62]  conclusion of
[4543.62 --> 4544.12]  the matter.
[4544.44 --> 4544.98]  Now all has
[4544.98 --> 4545.38]  been heard.
[4545.50 --> 4546.10]  Here is the
[4546.10 --> 4546.74]  conclusion of
[4546.74 --> 4547.08]  the matter.
[4547.26 --> 4548.20]  Fear God and
[4548.20 --> 4549.18]  keep his
[4549.18 --> 4549.78]  commandments,
[4550.08 --> 4550.98]  for this is
[4550.98 --> 4551.82]  the duty of
[4551.82 --> 4552.50]  all mankind.
[4554.32 --> 4555.36]  Literally there
[4555.36 --> 4556.14]  it says,
[4556.14 --> 4557.96]  for this is
[4557.96 --> 4559.26]  the whole of
[4559.26 --> 4559.70]  man.
[4560.40 --> 4560.78]  The word
[4560.78 --> 4561.44]  duty is
[4561.44 --> 4562.14]  supplied by
[4562.14 --> 4562.82]  the translators
[4562.82 --> 4563.30]  to make it
[4563.30 --> 4563.64]  fit with
[4563.64 --> 4564.24]  English grammar
[4564.24 --> 4565.34]  rules, to
[4565.34 --> 4565.64]  give it a
[4565.64 --> 4566.16]  verb to
[4566.16 --> 4566.84]  hang on to.
[4568.10 --> 4568.96]  But I like
[4568.96 --> 4570.44]  the idea that
[4570.44 --> 4571.44]  the whole of
[4571.44 --> 4572.20]  what it means
[4572.20 --> 4573.12]  to be human
[4573.12 --> 4574.28]  is to fear
[4574.28 --> 4574.82]  God and to
[4574.82 --> 4575.14]  keep his
[4575.14 --> 4575.50]  commandments.
[4576.74 --> 4576.84]  Right?
[4576.90 --> 4577.54]  To be human
[4577.54 --> 4578.44]  is to worship
[4578.44 --> 4579.42]  God and
[4579.42 --> 4579.94]  obey him.
[4581.10 --> 4582.02]  The Westminster
[4582.02 --> 4583.32]  Catechism summarizes
[4583.32 --> 4583.96]  this point.
[4584.06 --> 4584.46]  It asks,
[4584.82 --> 4585.28]  what is the
[4585.28 --> 4586.02]  chief end of
[4586.02 --> 4586.32]  man?
[4586.36 --> 4586.82]  And the answer
[4586.82 --> 4587.36]  is simple.
[4587.68 --> 4588.90]  To glorify God
[4588.90 --> 4589.92]  and enjoy him
[4589.92 --> 4590.28]  together.
[4591.40 --> 4592.18]  What if that
[4592.18 --> 4592.60]  was actually
[4592.60 --> 4592.92]  true?
[4594.68 --> 4595.50]  That your
[4595.50 --> 4597.58]  purpose is to
[4597.58 --> 4598.52]  glorify God
[4598.52 --> 4599.78]  and enjoy him
[4599.78 --> 4600.14]  forever.
[4600.92 --> 4602.20]  To worship him
[4602.20 --> 4603.00]  and to find
[4603.00 --> 4604.66]  joy in him.
[4605.66 --> 4606.48]  This is the
[4606.48 --> 4607.22]  perspective that
[4607.22 --> 4608.12]  Ecclesiastes is
[4608.12 --> 4608.84]  calling us to
[4608.84 --> 4609.10]  take.
[4609.58 --> 4610.14]  Especially,
[4610.52 --> 4611.72]  especially when
[4611.72 --> 4612.92]  the enigmas of
[4612.92 --> 4614.50]  life don't
[4614.50 --> 4616.12]  match up.
[4618.74 --> 4619.52]  Even when
[4619.52 --> 4620.92]  everything seems
[4620.92 --> 4621.78]  meaningless,
[4622.24 --> 4622.84]  even when the
[4622.84 --> 4623.80]  struggle or the
[4623.80 --> 4624.44]  pain that you
[4624.44 --> 4625.04]  live in is
[4625.04 --> 4625.94]  all-consuming,
[4626.18 --> 4626.82]  it is your
[4626.82 --> 4627.98]  purpose to
[4627.98 --> 4629.28]  fear God and
[4629.28 --> 4629.90]  to keep his
[4629.90 --> 4630.36]  commandments.
[4631.72 --> 4632.34]  And in fact,
[4632.44 --> 4633.04]  I would suggest
[4633.04 --> 4634.06]  to you, it is
[4634.06 --> 4635.08]  the persistence
[4635.08 --> 4636.48]  of that belief
[4636.48 --> 4638.28]  in you that
[4638.28 --> 4639.32]  makes you persist
[4639.32 --> 4639.90]  when you don't
[4639.90 --> 4640.36]  believe it.
[4641.72 --> 4642.58]  right?
[4642.64 --> 4643.00]  It's that
[4643.00 --> 4645.10]  your heart
[4645.10 --> 4645.62]  and your
[4645.62 --> 4646.36]  imagination
[4646.36 --> 4647.86]  cling to the
[4647.86 --> 4648.84]  truth of this
[4648.84 --> 4650.74]  that when
[4650.74 --> 4652.06]  even all of
[4652.06 --> 4652.88]  life denies
[4652.88 --> 4654.92]  it, you
[4654.92 --> 4655.36]  hang on.
[4656.34 --> 4657.34]  Because behind
[4657.34 --> 4658.00]  that hanging
[4658.00 --> 4658.82]  on, of course,
[4658.88 --> 4659.54]  is a God
[4659.54 --> 4660.18]  who's hanging
[4660.18 --> 4660.92]  on to you.
[4661.92 --> 4662.90]  A God who's
[4662.90 --> 4663.92]  speaking and
[4663.92 --> 4665.40]  holding you.
[4666.60 --> 4667.10]  And this
[4667.10 --> 4668.36]  rightly changes
[4668.36 --> 4669.52]  our perspective
[4669.52 --> 4671.06]  on everything.
[4671.76 --> 4672.30]  And again, I
[4672.30 --> 4672.90]  love the way
[4672.90 --> 4673.76]  that Gibson
[4673.76 --> 4674.84]  summarizes it.
[4675.42 --> 4675.70]  And I'm
[4675.70 --> 4676.50]  paraphrasing here.
[4676.62 --> 4676.82]  He says,
[4677.20 --> 4678.06]  why do you
[4678.06 --> 4678.70]  need to be a
[4678.70 --> 4679.22]  certain kind
[4679.22 --> 4679.78]  of employee?
[4681.18 --> 4682.18]  Because your
[4682.18 --> 4682.84]  purpose is to
[4682.84 --> 4683.36]  fear God and
[4683.36 --> 4683.72]  keep his
[4683.72 --> 4684.02]  commandments.
[4685.62 --> 4686.36]  Why do you
[4686.36 --> 4686.90]  need to be a
[4686.90 --> 4687.40]  certain kind
[4687.40 --> 4687.94]  of employer?
[4689.06 --> 4689.88]  Because your
[4689.88 --> 4690.50]  purpose is to
[4690.50 --> 4691.08]  fear God and
[4691.08 --> 4691.52]  to keep his
[4691.52 --> 4691.90]  commandments.
[4692.80 --> 4693.52]  Why do you
[4693.52 --> 4694.18]  have to be a
[4694.18 --> 4694.70]  certain kind
[4694.70 --> 4695.26]  of child?
[4696.20 --> 4696.82]  Because you
[4696.82 --> 4697.60]  fear God and
[4697.60 --> 4698.14]  you know that
[4698.14 --> 4698.68]  he has called
[4698.68 --> 4699.70]  you to honor
[4699.70 --> 4700.38]  your parents.
[4702.42 --> 4702.88]  Right?
[4702.94 --> 4703.80]  Because everything
[4703.80 --> 4705.62]  you do, you
[4705.62 --> 4706.66]  do first and
[4706.66 --> 4707.66]  foremost for God.
[4707.86 --> 4709.04]  That's why you're
[4709.04 --> 4709.90]  a particular kind
[4709.90 --> 4710.36]  of husband.
[4713.70 --> 4714.66]  The beginning
[4714.66 --> 4715.68]  and the end of
[4715.68 --> 4717.16]  everything you
[4717.16 --> 4717.86]  do, of
[4717.86 --> 4719.04]  everything you
[4719.04 --> 4720.22]  are, is found
[4720.22 --> 4720.82]  in your
[4720.82 --> 4722.42]  relationship to
[4722.42 --> 4723.26]  God.
[4723.26 --> 4727.68]  in fearing
[4727.68 --> 4729.92]  him and in
[4729.92 --> 4730.66]  obeying him.
[4733.42 --> 4734.18]  And if that
[4734.18 --> 4734.92]  offends you,
[4735.48 --> 4737.48]  or maybe it
[4737.48 --> 4737.98]  doesn't offend
[4737.98 --> 4738.96]  you, if you
[4738.96 --> 4739.52]  sit here and
[4739.52 --> 4740.30]  think, well that
[4740.30 --> 4740.94]  doesn't take into
[4740.94 --> 4741.60]  account this.
[4742.44 --> 4743.16]  Or you don't
[4743.16 --> 4743.80]  know my story,
[4743.94 --> 4744.38]  pastor, that
[4744.38 --> 4745.06]  doesn't take into
[4745.06 --> 4745.54]  account what's
[4745.54 --> 4746.04]  going on over
[4746.04 --> 4746.30]  here.
[4747.08 --> 4747.90]  Or you haven't
[4747.90 --> 4748.46]  been through what
[4748.46 --> 4749.02]  I've been through.
[4749.16 --> 4750.00]  If any of those
[4750.00 --> 4750.76]  kinds of responses
[4750.76 --> 4751.50]  are welling up in
[4751.50 --> 4752.24]  you, you are
[4752.24 --> 4752.94]  thinking like a
[4752.94 --> 4753.82]  modern contemporary,
[4754.44 --> 4755.70]  not like the
[4755.70 --> 4756.52]  book of Ecclesiastes
[4756.52 --> 4757.10]  wants you to
[4757.10 --> 4758.20]  teach and wants
[4758.20 --> 4758.70]  you to think.
[4760.02 --> 4760.74]  You are thinking
[4760.74 --> 4761.92]  with you at the
[4761.92 --> 4763.06]  center of your
[4763.06 --> 4763.52]  life.
[4763.60 --> 4764.10]  But remember,
[4764.26 --> 4765.38]  Ecclesiastes is a
[4765.38 --> 4766.60]  project of
[4766.60 --> 4767.94]  de-centering and
[4767.94 --> 4769.28]  re-centering, of
[4769.28 --> 4770.62]  de-centering yourself
[4770.62 --> 4771.82]  and making God
[4771.82 --> 4772.56]  the center.
[4773.34 --> 4774.44]  And in doing so,
[4774.56 --> 4775.52]  you actually,
[4775.80 --> 4777.68]  finally, become
[4777.68 --> 4779.26]  the unique person
[4779.26 --> 4779.98]  that you were
[4779.98 --> 4780.70]  always meant to
[4780.70 --> 4781.00]  be.
[4782.24 --> 4783.10]  That's the
[4783.10 --> 4783.42]  center.
[4784.54 --> 4786.02]  He's the
[4786.02 --> 4786.36]  center.
[4789.02 --> 4790.20]  And then lastly,
[4790.44 --> 4791.14]  verse 14.
[4792.58 --> 4793.10]  For God will
[4793.10 --> 4794.02]  bring every
[4794.02 --> 4795.08]  deed into
[4795.08 --> 4795.66]  judgment,
[4796.78 --> 4797.54]  including every
[4797.54 --> 4798.16]  hidden thing,
[4798.36 --> 4798.86]  whether it is
[4798.86 --> 4800.32]  good or
[4800.32 --> 4800.64]  evil.
[4802.52 --> 4804.18]  The final gift
[4804.18 --> 4805.38]  of God's word
[4805.38 --> 4806.22]  to us, the
[4806.22 --> 4807.48]  final reflection
[4807.48 --> 4808.50]  from the teacher
[4808.50 --> 4809.78]  of Ecclesiastes,
[4809.78 --> 4810.00]  Ecclesiastes,
[4810.20 --> 4811.18]  takes us back
[4811.18 --> 4811.64]  to the very
[4811.64 --> 4812.62]  beginning of
[4812.62 --> 4813.86]  this message.
[4814.38 --> 4815.52]  Death and
[4815.52 --> 4816.86]  judgment are
[4816.86 --> 4817.50]  certain.
[4820.44 --> 4821.18]  And so live
[4821.18 --> 4821.64]  like it.
[4824.04 --> 4824.56]  That's the
[4824.56 --> 4825.30]  final preparation
[4825.30 --> 4825.94]  that God's word
[4825.94 --> 4826.42]  gives us.
[4826.76 --> 4827.44]  And in making
[4827.44 --> 4828.08]  this point,
[4828.46 --> 4829.30]  Gibson tells this
[4829.30 --> 4830.00]  story, and it's a
[4830.00 --> 4830.64]  story that as I
[4830.64 --> 4831.22]  read it the first
[4831.22 --> 4832.24]  time, I can relate
[4832.24 --> 4832.98]  to it because I
[4832.98 --> 4833.76]  have had the same
[4833.76 --> 4834.10]  dream.
[4834.20 --> 4834.72]  And I suspect
[4834.72 --> 4835.58]  maybe some of you
[4835.58 --> 4836.54]  have had a version
[4836.54 --> 4837.24]  of this dream
[4837.24 --> 4837.96]  yourselves.
[4838.72 --> 4840.76]  But I, I don't
[4840.76 --> 4841.42]  want to say often
[4841.42 --> 4842.00]  because that would
[4842.00 --> 4842.96]  belie my anxiety,
[4843.14 --> 4844.96]  but I regularly
[4844.96 --> 4846.72]  have this dream
[4846.72 --> 4848.58]  where I wake up
[4848.58 --> 4850.32]  and it's a church,
[4850.36 --> 4851.04]  and I'm in a church
[4851.04 --> 4852.56]  service that I'm
[4852.56 --> 4853.38]  supposed to lead.
[4855.04 --> 4856.52]  And I have no clue
[4856.52 --> 4857.30]  what's going on.
[4858.12 --> 4859.28]  I have no idea
[4859.28 --> 4859.94]  where I am.
[4860.34 --> 4861.34]  I have no idea
[4861.34 --> 4861.92]  what the sermon
[4861.92 --> 4863.26]  text is, but someone
[4863.26 --> 4864.02]  comes down to me
[4864.02 --> 4865.02]  who I've never seen
[4865.02 --> 4865.90]  before, and they're
[4865.90 --> 4866.60]  like, okay, pastor,
[4866.70 --> 4867.38]  go ahead and preach.
[4869.00 --> 4869.96]  And I have to walk
[4869.96 --> 4871.06]  onto the platform
[4871.06 --> 4871.96]  and look out
[4871.96 --> 4872.56]  these people that I
[4872.56 --> 4873.38]  have no idea who
[4873.38 --> 4874.34]  they are, but I can
[4874.34 --> 4875.52]  feel the expectation
[4875.52 --> 4876.80]  coming from them.
[4877.06 --> 4877.96]  I don't even have a
[4877.96 --> 4879.56]  Bible or an iPad or
[4879.56 --> 4880.68]  a phone in front of
[4880.68 --> 4881.90]  me to, what am I
[4881.90 --> 4882.16]  to do?
[4882.30 --> 4883.28]  And then, praise
[4883.28 --> 4884.22]  Jesus, I wake up
[4884.22 --> 4884.92]  and it's all a dream.
[4892.72 --> 4895.28]  Now, when you wake
[4895.28 --> 4896.60]  up, you realize,
[4897.68 --> 4899.16]  I didn't miss the
[4899.16 --> 4899.50]  deadline.
[4900.50 --> 4901.84]  I didn't screw up
[4901.84 --> 4902.38]  completely.
[4903.52 --> 4904.60]  Things are still
[4904.60 --> 4906.18]  okay.
[4906.36 --> 4907.98]  There's time to get
[4907.98 --> 4908.64]  ready.
[4910.82 --> 4911.60]  Gibson says,
[4911.72 --> 4912.50]  Ecclesiastes
[4912.50 --> 4915.44]  tells us that a day
[4915.44 --> 4917.04]  is coming when
[4917.04 --> 4918.20]  people will discover
[4918.20 --> 4919.86]  that they are not
[4919.86 --> 4920.88]  ready for the most
[4920.88 --> 4922.26]  important event of the
[4922.26 --> 4923.42]  world, and this time
[4923.42 --> 4924.78]  it won't be a dream.
[4926.78 --> 4927.96]  You won't wake up
[4927.96 --> 4928.76]  and find out there's
[4928.76 --> 4929.44]  still more time.
[4931.18 --> 4932.50]  For so many people
[4932.50 --> 4933.56]  in the world today,
[4933.86 --> 4934.96]  life has become one
[4934.96 --> 4936.48]  long exercise of
[4936.48 --> 4937.98]  avoiding reality and
[4937.98 --> 4938.94]  ignoring the truth
[4938.94 --> 4940.10]  that death and
[4940.10 --> 4941.44]  judgment are coming.
[4942.52 --> 4943.50]  And the words of the
[4943.50 --> 4944.46]  teacher, the word of
[4944.46 --> 4945.84]  God, is meant to be a
[4945.84 --> 4947.48]  goad that shakes you
[4947.48 --> 4947.96]  awake.
[4949.44 --> 4950.82]  That shakes you from
[4950.82 --> 4952.66]  your spiritual slumber
[4952.66 --> 4954.62]  that ends the dream
[4954.62 --> 4955.24]  that you have been
[4955.24 --> 4956.62]  hiding in while there
[4956.62 --> 4957.48]  is still time.
[4960.88 --> 4961.80]  And if you're a
[4961.80 --> 4964.60]  Christian today, make
[4964.60 --> 4965.82]  sure you hear this.
[4967.46 --> 4969.04]  Because for the
[4969.04 --> 4971.28]  Christian, in this
[4971.28 --> 4972.54]  moment, in this
[4972.54 --> 4973.80]  reality of waking from
[4973.80 --> 4975.30]  that slumber, there is
[4975.30 --> 4976.50]  no fear.
[4976.50 --> 4976.58]  fear.
[4978.64 --> 4980.52]  There is no fear
[4980.52 --> 4982.08]  because of who
[4982.08 --> 4983.54]  Jesus is and what
[4983.54 --> 4984.88]  Jesus has done.
[4985.22 --> 4986.36]  The teacher says
[4986.36 --> 4988.10]  throughout that there
[4988.10 --> 4989.96]  is no gain for all
[4989.96 --> 4991.18]  the toil to be had
[4991.18 --> 4991.88]  under the sun.
[4992.60 --> 4993.20]  This is a message
[4993.20 --> 4993.90]  over and over and
[4993.90 --> 4994.48]  over again through
[4994.48 --> 4995.04]  Ecclesiastes.
[4995.18 --> 4996.52]  There is no gain for
[4996.52 --> 4997.94]  all the toil to be had
[4997.94 --> 4998.50]  under the sun.
[4998.76 --> 4999.46]  But the Apostle
[4999.46 --> 5001.24]  Paul, the Apostle
[5001.24 --> 5002.12]  Paul in Philippians
[5002.12 --> 5003.56]  1.21 says,
[5003.56 --> 5005.24]  For me to live is
[5005.24 --> 5007.06]  Christ and to die
[5007.06 --> 5009.28]  is gain.
[5012.84 --> 5013.98]  The Apostle Paul
[5013.98 --> 5015.08]  says that we can
[5015.08 --> 5016.82]  labor in the Lord
[5016.82 --> 5018.14]  for in Him our
[5018.14 --> 5019.56]  labors are not
[5019.56 --> 5022.10]  in vain.
[5023.30 --> 5024.78]  We can labor for
[5024.78 --> 5026.02]  Christ while we
[5026.02 --> 5027.32]  yet live and we
[5027.32 --> 5028.28]  can live with
[5028.28 --> 5029.56]  Christ even when
[5029.56 --> 5030.16]  we die.
[5030.24 --> 5030.84]  That's why there's
[5030.84 --> 5032.10]  no fear here for
[5032.10 --> 5033.02]  you and for me
[5033.02 --> 5033.72]  who believe.
[5034.12 --> 5034.88]  Because Jesus
[5034.88 --> 5035.76]  lived the life I
[5035.76 --> 5036.32]  should have lived.
[5036.52 --> 5037.54]  Because Jesus died
[5037.54 --> 5038.44]  the death that I
[5038.44 --> 5038.74]  deserve.
[5038.84 --> 5040.04]  Because Jesus took
[5040.04 --> 5041.88]  my sin, took your
[5041.88 --> 5043.34]  sin, and took your
[5043.34 --> 5045.38]  shame, took my pain,
[5045.56 --> 5046.72]  and gave me His
[5046.72 --> 5047.86]  righteousness and
[5047.86 --> 5048.50]  His glory.
[5048.80 --> 5050.12]  Because He loved me
[5050.12 --> 5051.44]  when I was His
[5051.44 --> 5052.14]  enemy.
[5053.50 --> 5053.62]  Right?
[5053.68 --> 5054.78]  Not only do we not
[5054.78 --> 5055.80]  have to fear death
[5055.80 --> 5056.90]  and judgment because
[5056.90 --> 5058.10]  He was judged in
[5058.10 --> 5059.12]  your place and He
[5059.12 --> 5060.30]  was found perfect.
[5060.58 --> 5061.68]  He died in your
[5061.68 --> 5062.84]  place and you have
[5062.84 --> 5063.58]  been raised with
[5063.58 --> 5065.00]  Him in newness of
[5065.00 --> 5066.16]  life by grace
[5066.16 --> 5066.86]  through faith.
[5067.36 --> 5068.98]  But even, even
[5068.98 --> 5070.70]  now in the enigmas
[5070.70 --> 5071.76]  of life that
[5071.76 --> 5073.54]  persist, right now,
[5073.86 --> 5075.96]  today, you, you
[5075.96 --> 5077.86]  have a God who is
[5077.86 --> 5079.62]  with you and for
[5079.62 --> 5080.00]  you.
[5081.38 --> 5082.94]  Even in the darkest
[5082.94 --> 5084.72]  night of your soul,
[5084.94 --> 5086.62]  you have hope.
[5086.62 --> 5086.68]  hope.
[5087.94 --> 5089.32]  Because you have a God
[5089.32 --> 5091.14]  who has overcome the
[5091.14 --> 5091.50]  darkness.
[5091.70 --> 5091.90]  Amen?
[5093.78 --> 5095.64]  Even as you count all
[5095.64 --> 5097.36]  the despairs of this
[5097.36 --> 5099.12]  present moment, hope
[5099.12 --> 5101.00]  is not lost.
[5103.30 --> 5106.00]  I love the way that
[5106.00 --> 5107.70]  Wendell Berry put it.
[5108.98 --> 5110.00]  Wendell Berry says,
[5110.00 --> 5112.76]  A person who marks
[5112.76 --> 5114.32]  his trial into
[5114.32 --> 5116.12]  despair remembers
[5116.12 --> 5120.20]  hope and thus has
[5120.20 --> 5124.24]  hope, even if only a
[5124.24 --> 5124.44]  little.
[5126.74 --> 5128.84]  To live backwards means
[5128.84 --> 5130.82]  facing death and
[5130.82 --> 5132.12]  judgment honestly.
[5133.12 --> 5135.04]  It means fearing God
[5135.04 --> 5136.22]  and obeying His
[5136.22 --> 5136.74]  commands.
[5136.74 --> 5137.80]  And it means
[5137.80 --> 5139.86]  receiving life as
[5139.86 --> 5142.38]  a gift, even when
[5142.38 --> 5143.78]  it doesn't make
[5143.78 --> 5144.50]  sense.
[5144.90 --> 5145.72]  Because one day,
[5146.24 --> 5148.28]  one day, it
[5148.28 --> 5148.52]  will.
[5149.76 --> 5151.04]  That's the hope of
[5151.04 --> 5152.56]  the gospel for you.
[5153.60 --> 5155.90]  And that, that is
[5155.90 --> 5157.10]  the message that the
[5157.10 --> 5159.14]  world needs to hear.
[5159.88 --> 5160.16]  Amen?
[5161.00 --> 5162.04]  Let's pray together.
[5166.74 --> 5174.74]  God of this life,
[5175.96 --> 5177.34]  God of this moment,
[5178.30 --> 5180.50]  you are sovereign
[5180.50 --> 5183.48]  over the enigmas of
[5183.48 --> 5184.62]  this present darkness.
[5184.88 --> 5186.92]  You are sovereign over
[5186.92 --> 5188.64]  the experience of
[5188.64 --> 5190.32]  meaninglessness in this
[5190.32 --> 5191.96]  moment when we pursue
[5191.96 --> 5193.32]  things other than you.
[5193.50 --> 5194.50]  Lord God, open our
[5194.50 --> 5196.64]  eyes, goad us back to
[5196.64 --> 5197.96]  the path of life.
[5206.24 --> 5207.44]  Where else shall we
[5207.44 --> 5208.12]  go, Lord?
[5209.04 --> 5210.46]  For you are the
[5210.46 --> 5211.76]  words of eternal
[5211.76 --> 5212.78]  life.
[5214.36 --> 5215.46]  In Jesus' name we
[5215.46 --> 5215.72]  pray.
[5216.78 --> 5217.16]  Amen.
[5218.16 --> 5218.42]  Amen.
[5226.64 --> 5230.30]  I invite you to
[5230.30 --> 5231.24]  stand with us.
[5231.24 --> 5231.62]  Amen.
[5231.62 --> 5261.60]  Thank you.
[5261.62 --> 5286.62]  Let me hide my sound in thee. Let the water and the blood from thy wounded side which flowed be of sin the double cure.
[5286.62 --> 5292.62]  Save from love and make me pure.
[5292.62 --> 5322.62] 
[5322.62 --> 5334.62]  All for sin could not atone. Thou must save and thou alone.
[5334.62 --> 5348.62]  Nothing in my hand I bring. Simply to the cross I cling.
[5348.62 --> 5360.62]  Naked come to thee for dress. Helpless look to thee for grace.
[5360.62 --> 5372.62]  Fall I to the fountain fly. Wash me, Savior, or I die.
[5372.62 --> 5390.08]  Jesus holy, pure and lovely, King of mercy.
[5390.08 --> 5412.08]  You are Jesus holy, pure and lovely, King of mercy.
[5412.08 --> 5421.08]  While I draw this fleeting breath.
[5421.08 --> 5427.08]  When my eyes still close in death.
[5427.08 --> 5433.08]  When I soar to worlds unknown.
[5433.08 --> 5439.08]  See thy love, thy judgment flow.
[5439.08 --> 5445.08]  Rock of ages, cleft for me.
[5445.08 --> 5451.08]  Let me hide myself in thee.
[5451.08 --> 5458.08]  O Jesus holy, King of mercy.
[5458.08 --> 5468.08]  O Jesus holy, King of mercy.
[5468.08 --> 5469.08]  King of mercy.
[5469.08 --> 5470.08]  You are Jesus holy, pure and lovely, King of mercy.
[5470.08 --> 5475.08]  You are Jesus holy, pure and lovely, King of mercy.
[5475.08 --> 5476.08]  Hope of mercy, hope of mercy.
[5476.08 --> 5480.08]  Jesus holy, pure and lovely, King of mercy.
[5480.08 --> 5482.08]  Hope of mercy, hope of glory.
[5482.08 --> 5485.08]  Jesus holy, pure and lovely, King of mercy.
[5485.08 --> 5490.08]  Jesus holy, pure and lovely, King of mercy.
[5490.08 --> 5495.08]  Rock of ages, cleft for me.
[5495.08 --> 5504.08]  Let me hide myself in thee.
[5504.08 --> 5517.08]  Let me hide myself in thee.
[5517.08 --> 5530.08]  As you go into this week full of enigmas, meaninglessness, and vanities, know that you go as those who are hid in Christ.
[5530.08 --> 5534.08]  You go as those who are blessed by God.
[5534.08 --> 5543.08]  So we receive his blessing in the promise of God's true and sure word to us.
[5543.08 --> 5546.08]  Following our worship, there will be a time of fellowship.
[5546.08 --> 5547.08]  Encourage you to stick around.
[5547.08 --> 5550.08]  Have some good, meaningful conversation with people.
[5550.08 --> 5554.08]  Ask someone how they have seen God at work in their life.
[5554.08 --> 5559.08]  If you would like to meet someone for prayer, there will be people available who have yellow name tags on.
[5559.08 --> 5561.08]  I think there will be someone up here.
[5561.08 --> 5563.08]  They would love to meet you and pray with you.
[5563.08 --> 5569.08]  And then again, if you would like to sign up for a care group, please meet me at the Connect booth in the back there.
[5569.08 --> 5572.08]  Receive the blessing of God for this week.
[5572.08 --> 5578.08]  God, go before you to lead you.
[5578.08 --> 5581.08]  God, go behind you to protect you.
[5581.08 --> 5583.08]  God, go beneath you to support you.
[5583.08 --> 5586.08]  And God, go beside you to befriend you.
[5586.08 --> 5589.08]  Do not be afraid.
[5589.08 --> 5592.08]  Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[5592.08 --> 5594.08]  Do not be afraid.
[5594.08 --> 5600.08]  But go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
[5600.08 --> 5601.08]  Amen.
