[0.00 → 1.36] Against you
[1.36 → 4.86] If you want to know
[4.86 → 6.74] How far my love can go
[6.74 → 8.40] Just how deep
[8.40 → 10.32] Just how wide
[10.32 → 12.36] If you want to see
[12.36 → 14.20] How much you mean to me
[14.20 → 16.08] Look at my hands
[16.08 → 18.00] Look at my side
[18.00 → 20.54] If you could count the times
[20.54 → 22.22] And say you are
[22.22 → 23.24] Forgiving
[23.24 → 26.36] It's more than the drops in the ocean
[30.00 → 36.70] Don't think you need to settle
[36.70 → 38.36] For a substitute
[38.36 → 42.28] When I'm the only love
[42.28 → 43.90] That changes you
[43.90 → 46.58] And I am for you
[46.58 → 50.58] I'm not against you
[50.58 → 54.26] I am for you
[54.26 → 58.10] I'm not against you
[58.10 → 61.54] If you want to know
[61.54 → 63.42] How far my love can go
[63.42 → 65.08] Just how deep
[65.08 → 66.98] Just how wide
[66.98 → 69.04] If you want to see
[69.04 → 70.90] How much you mean to me
[70.90 → 72.78] Look at my hands
[72.78 → 74.68] Look at my side
[74.68 → 77.22] If you could count the times
[77.22 → 78.94] And say you are
[78.94 → 79.90] Forgiving
[79.90 → 83.10] It's more than the drops in the ocean
[83.10 → 92.38] Open your heart
[92.38 → 95.26] It's time that we start again
[95.26 → 99.96] Open your heart
[99.96 → 102.74] It's time that we start again
[102.74 → 106.90] If you want to know
[106.90 → 108.78] How far my love can go
[108.78 → 110.42] Just how deep
[110.42 → 112.00] Just how wide
[112.00 → 114.38] If you want to see
[114.38 → 116.26] How much you mean to me
[116.26 → 118.14] Look at my hands
[118.14 → 119.54] Look at my side
[119.54 → 122.58] If you could count the times
[122.58 → 124.26] And say you are
[124.26 → 125.26] Forgiving
[125.26 → 128.70] It's more than the drops in the ocean
[128.70 → 136.08] The drops in the ocean
[136.08 → 143.82] I am for you
[143.82 → 144.86] I am for you
[144.86 → 149.10] I am not against you
[149.10 → 152.46] I am for you
[152.46 → 156.82] I am not against you
[156.82 → 176.84] You're not the only one
[176.84 → 178.68] Who feels like this
[178.68 → 180.82] Feeling like you lose
[180.82 → 182.46] More than you win
[182.46 → 185.50] Like life is just an endless hill
[185.50 → 186.54] You climb
[186.54 → 188.70] You try and try
[188.70 → 190.96] But never arrive
[190.96 → 193.96] I am telling you something
[193.96 → 194.98] This racing
[194.98 → 195.96] This running
[195.96 → 198.72] Oh you are working way too hard
[198.72 → 199.72] You are working way too hard
[199.72 → 200.92] And this perfection
[200.92 → 201.94] You are chasing
[201.94 → 204.06] Is just energy wasted
[204.06 → 206.72] Because he loves you like you are
[206.72 → 210.18] So go ahead and live like you're loved
[210.18 → 214.76] It's okay to act like you've been set free
[214.76 → 218.20] His love has made you more than enough
[218.20 → 222.98] So go ahead and be who he made you to be
[222.98 → 226.18] And live like you're loved
[226.18 → 230.18] Live like you're loved
[230.18 → 237.18] Live like you're loved
[237.18 → 242.02] And live like you know you're valuable
[242.02 → 246.54] Like you know the one that holds your soul
[246.54 → 250.72] Cause mercy has called you by your name
[250.72 → 255.00] Don't be afraid to live in that grace
[255.00 → 257.96] Oh I'm telling you something
[257.96 → 260.16] This God we believe in
[260.16 → 262.64] Yeah he changed everything
[262.64 → 264.74] No more guilt
[264.74 → 265.78] No more shame
[265.78 → 267.76] He took all that away
[267.76 → 270.96] Gave us a reason to sing
[270.96 → 274.16] So go ahead and live like you're loved
[274.16 → 278.80] It's okay to act like you've been set free
[278.80 → 282.20] His love has made you more than enough
[282.20 → 286.96] So go ahead and be who he made you to be
[286.96 → 291.08] And live like you're loved
[291.08 → 295.14] Live like you're loved
[295.14 → 299.14] Live like you're loved
[299.14 → 303.16] Live like you're loved
[303.16 → 305.04] Live like you're loved
[305.04 → 306.96] Walk like you're free
[306.96 → 310.96] Stay like you know who he made you to be
[310.96 → 313.74] Live like you're loved
[313.74 → 314.40] Live like you're loved
[314.40 → 318.44] His love is all that you'll ever need
[318.44 → 320.28] Live like you're loved
[320.28 → 321.92] Live like you're loved
[321.92 → 323.34] Live like you're loved
[323.34 → 324.18] Live like you're loved
[324.18 → 325.08] Live like you're loved
[325.08 → 325.52] Live like you're loved
[325.52 → 327.96] Live like you're loved
[327.96 → 330.24] His love has made you more than enough
[330.24 → 333.40] Live like you're loved
[333.40 → 335.28] Live like you're loved
[335.28 → 335.96] Live like you're loved
[335.96 → 337.16] Live like you're loved
[337.16 → 338.16] Live like you're loved
[338.16 → 339.32] Live like you're loved
[339.32 → 340.12] Move like you're loved
[340.12 → 342.80] To act like you've been set free
[342.80 → 346.52] His love has made you more than enough
[346.52 → 351.06] So go ahead and be who he made you to be
[351.06 → 353.88] And live like you're loved
[353.88 → 356.96] Live like you're loved
[356.96 → 361.00] Live like you're loved
[361.00 → 365.08] Live like you're loved
[365.08 → 369.06] Live like you're loved
[369.06 → 370.98] Walk like you're free
[370.98 → 375.00] Stand like you know who he made you to be
[375.00 → 377.10] Live like you're loved
[377.10 → 379.06] Like you believe
[379.06 → 383.04] His love is all that you'll ever need
[383.04 → 385.28] Live like you're loved
[399.06 → 408.00] When you're at the end of the road
[408.00 → 412.24] And it's not the one that you would have chosen
[412.24 → 415.78] When you're at the end of your road
[415.78 → 417.30] And you're holding on
[417.30 → 420.08] But feel like you're falling
[420.08 → 423.50] With every option exhausted
[423.50 → 427.64] You tried everything you know
[427.64 → 432.20] You saw light then you lost it
[432.20 → 434.08] But there is still hope
[434.08 → 439.20] Like the fire in the night
[439.20 → 443.14] Like the ocean parted wide
[443.14 → 446.94] Like the grave empty inside
[446.94 → 451.00] You will see he still does
[451.00 → 452.92] Miracles
[452.92 → 454.92] Miracles
[454.92 → 456.94] Miracles
[456.94 → 459.04] Miracles
[459.04 → 462.46] Even if you don't see it now
[462.46 → 464.18] Without a doubt
[464.18 → 466.98] He's already moving
[466.98 → 470.40] There's not a pain that you hold
[470.40 → 472.00] He doesn't know
[472.00 → 474.84] And he isn't using
[474.84 → 478.14] With every option exhausted
[478.14 → 482.38] You tried everything you know
[482.38 → 486.98] So reach for something beyond it
[486.98 → 489.92] Because he is our hope
[489.92 → 493.84] Like the fire in the night
[493.84 → 497.76] Like the ocean parted wide
[497.76 → 501.58] Like the grave empty inside
[501.58 → 505.62] You will see he still does
[505.62 → 507.06] Miracles
[507.06 → 508.98] Miracles
[508.98 → 510.82] Miracles
[510.82 → 512.82] Miracles
[512.82 → 514.82] Miracles
[514.82 → 516.82] Miracles
[516.82 → 518.82] Miracles
[518.82 → 520.82] Miracles
[520.82 → 525.38] A broken heart can be restored
[525.38 → 528.58] Good morning
[528.58 → 532.26] Welcome to church
[532.26 → 533.82] A special welcome
[533.82 → 536.28] If you are a guest with us this morning
[536.28 → 539.16] We are really excited to have you here
[539.16 → 541.94] And to worship together this morning
[541.94 → 542.86] My name is Chris
[542.86 → 545.42] I'm one of the pastors here at Emanuel
[545.42 → 546.72] And it's my pleasure
[546.72 → 547.84] Along with a few others
[547.84 → 551.12] To lead in our shared worship together this morning
[551.12 → 552.36] Before we begin
[552.36 → 554.58] We've got a couple announcements to run through
[554.58 → 556.96] And so we wanted to share that with you
[556.96 → 558.28] So I'm going to invite Josh to the front
[558.28 → 560.34] He's going to make his way forward
[560.34 → 562.96] And then as Josh is getting ready
[562.96 → 564.52] Just my first announcement
[564.52 → 566.92] After worship today
[566.92 → 569.40] We're going to have a new members class
[569.40 → 572.46] And so if you've been part of that class with us
[572.46 → 574.90] We're going to meet again today
[574.90 → 576.00] After worship
[576.00 → 577.78] But today we're actually going to meet at my house
[577.78 → 579.82] So you're going to come over for lunch
[579.82 → 581.74] And we'll have our class there
[581.74 → 582.86] So just talk to me afterwards
[582.86 → 585.26] If you have any questions about that
[585.26 → 586.18] And grab me afterwards
[586.18 → 586.96] Josh go ahead
[586.96 → 590.58] So the young adults are doing the care packages again
[590.58 → 592.28] For the students that are abroad
[592.28 → 595.68] We've got nine young adults
[595.68 → 597.38] Who are currently in school
[597.38 → 601.16] So the way it goes is like usual
[601.16 → 603.84] About $50 in the care package
[603.84 → 605.48] About the size of a shoebox
[605.48 → 608.28] With various things that they would need for school
[608.28 → 611.08] Or clothing or knick-knacks or fun things
[611.08 → 612.38] One guy got Lego
[612.38 → 614.66] And he loved that
[614.66 → 616.74] So if you get a guy
[616.74 → 618.14] That would be an awesome choice too
[618.14 → 619.34] Candy, anything
[619.34 → 621.52] Just a little note to share
[621.52 → 624.76] To show them that they're still anchored in this community
[624.76 → 626.22] And that we're still thinking about them
[626.22 → 629.90] And then also a little note
[629.90 → 632.54] To them asking about how school's going
[632.54 → 633.92] About how life's going
[633.92 → 635.98] To give that personal connection
[635.98 → 638.70] If you would like to volunteer to make one
[638.70 → 642.10] Again just bring the stuff in a bag or a box to me
[642.10 → 646.70] And we deal with the shipping to the location
[646.70 → 650.50] So don't try to buy a box from Canada Post or Shoppers
[650.50 → 652.46] Because we're just going to buy one
[652.46 → 654.34] So if you would like to volunteer
[654.34 → 656.02] Please come talk to me after church
[656.02 → 657.12] Or email me
[657.12 → 660.90] We would like to have them all in by next Sunday
[660.90 → 662.58] So that I can ship them out that Tuesday
[662.58 → 663.82] Thank you very much
[663.82 → 666.28] Thanks Josh
[666.28 → 670.32] I wanted to clarify that women also like Lego
[670.32 → 676.58] We have a couple other announcements to run through
[676.58 → 679.30] On Tuesday, pastoral elders
[679.30 → 682.20] We are meeting here at church at 7.30
[682.20 → 683.96] And so if you're part of that group
[683.96 → 685.18] Be prepared for that
[685.18 → 688.74] On Wednesday, Christianity Explored is meeting
[688.74 → 691.98] We're having our last official meeting on Wednesday
[691.98 → 693.62] And so please, if you've been part of that
[693.62 → 694.46] Be ready for that
[694.46 → 698.34] And then lastly, on February 22nd
[698.34 → 700.14] Which is this coming Saturday
[700.14 → 702.42] Coldest night of the year is happening
[702.42 → 703.60] And so we've got a group of people
[703.60 → 704.68] Who are already signed up
[704.68 → 706.86] To walk and participate in that
[706.86 → 707.92] You're encouraged
[707.92 → 709.92] You can still sing up this week to join the group
[709.92 → 712.06] Or you can go online and make a donation
[712.06 → 713.96] To those people there as well
[713.96 → 716.28] I think that's it for our announcements
[716.28 → 718.60] And so, as you're able
[718.60 → 719.24] And where you are
[719.24 → 720.38] I'm going to invite you to stand
[720.38 → 722.82] And we can be called into God's presence
[722.82 → 724.68] We can receive his greeting
[724.68 → 727.02] As he welcomes us in this space
[727.02 → 728.30] To worship together
[728.30 → 732.14] Following the receiving of God's greeting
[732.14 → 734.12] I'm going to invite you to turn to those around you
[734.12 → 736.00] And just welcome them into worship
[736.00 → 737.44] Again, just a simple reminder
[737.44 → 738.76] It's cough and cold season
[738.76 → 740.46] So not everyone wants to shake hands
[740.46 → 742.32] And so start with eye contact
[742.32 → 744.64] And then see if someone makes that first move
[744.64 → 746.56] To shake hands or otherwise
[746.56 → 749.16] Receive the greeting of our God
[749.16 → 754.46] Grace and mercy and peace to you
[754.46 → 755.66] From God our Father
[755.66 → 757.54] From the Lord Jesus Christ
[757.54 → 759.74] His Son and our Saviour
[759.74 → 762.76] Through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit
[762.76 → 763.96] Amen
[770.46 → 772.46] Amen
[800.46 → 809.52] We are also welcomed into a time of worship
[809.52 → 811.54] With a reading from Titus 3
[811.54 → 815.74] But when the kindness and love of God our Saviour appeared
[815.74 → 816.96] He saved us
[816.96 → 819.36] Not because of righteous things we had done
[819.36 → 821.12] But because of his mercy
[821.12 → 824.02] He saved us through the washing of rebirth
[824.02 → 825.84] And renewal by the Holy Spirit
[825.84 → 828.16] Whom he poured out on us generously
[828.16 → 830.54] Through Jesus Christ our Saviour
[830.54 → 834.18] So that having been justified by his grace
[834.18 → 835.92] We might become heirs
[835.92 → 838.32] Having the hope of eternal life
[858.16 → 865.04] Holy, holy, holy
[865.04 → 872.42] Lord God Almighty
[872.42 → 879.76] Early in the morning
[879.76 → 886.48] Our song shall rise to thee
[886.48 → 893.36] Holy, holy, holy
[893.36 → 894.02] Holy, holy
[894.02 → 901.04] Merciful and mighty
[901.04 → 909.04] God in three persons
[909.04 → 913.08] Blessed Trinity
[913.08 → 917.90] Holy, holy, holy
[917.90 → 919.96] Holy, holy
[919.96 → 921.96] Holy, holy
[921.96 → 929.64] All the saints adore thee
[929.64 → 936.40] Casting down their golden crowns
[936.40 → 942.28] Around the glassy sea
[942.28 → 950.16] Cherubim and seraphim
[950.16 → 956.66] Falling down before thee
[956.66 → 959.10] Who were the Lord
[959.10 → 961.48] Who were the Lord
[961.48 → 968.54] And evermore shall be
[968.54 → 971.54] Holy, holy, holy
[971.54 → 976.54] Holy, holy
[976.54 → 983.42] Though the darkness hide thee
[983.42 → 990.28] Though the eye may flood my sin
[990.28 → 996.42] Thy glory may not see
[996.42 → 1003.30] Boldly thou art holy
[1003.30 → 1010.30] There is none beside thee
[1010.30 → 1016.30] Perfect in power
[1016.30 → 1021.58] With love and purity
[1021.58 → 1037.04] And there is ex
[1037.04 → 1043.44] That as we street
[1043.44 → 1050.44] Lord, builder, or oversight of the mobile
[1050.44 → 1052.44] for thee.
[1055.66 → 1058.06] King of glory,
[1059.50 → 1062.44] holy are you, Lord,
[1062.92 → 1066.44] none beside thee.
[1068.10 → 1072.76] Perfect in power,
[1072.76 → 1079.08] my God forever.
[1080.44 → 1088.44] You were and are, and you will be,
[1089.46 → 1093.56] my God before thee.
[1096.08 → 1098.56] He of glory,
[1099.84 → 1102.44] holy are you, Lord,
[1102.44 → 1106.44] none beside thee.
[1106.44 → 1112.44] Perfect in power,
[1114.44 → 1119.56] my God forever.
[1119.56 → 1129.56] Pure and are and you will be.
[1129.56 → 1139.56] Holy, holy, holy,
[1139.56 → 1145.56] Lord God almighty,
[1145.56 → 1153.56] all thy works shall praise thy name,
[1153.56 → 1159.56] in earth and sky and sea.
[1159.56 → 1165.56] Holy, holy, holy,
[1165.56 → 1171.56] merciful and mighty.
[1171.56 → 1177.56] God is a person,
[1177.56 → 1179.56] blessed in the earth.
[1179.56 → 1183.56] Blessed Trinity,
[1183.56 → 1187.56] I stand before thee.
[1187.56 → 1189.56] Lord, holy, holy,
[1189.56 → 1195.56] holy, holy are you, Lord,

[1266.56 → 1276.22] You were and are and you will be.
[1296.56 → 1316.82] Put a new song in my heart.
[1316.82 → 1321.36] Let me hear the praises start.
[1321.36 → 1327.86] Dispel the night and give me light again.
[1331.86 → 1337.16] Put a new thought in my mind.
[1337.16 → 1341.96] Help me leave the past behind.
[1342.22 → 1348.38] And break these chains that I might live again.
[1351.36 → 1357.86] Lift my fallen face and help me to stand.
[1357.86 → 1362.86] Help me with the grace that comes from your hand.
[1362.86 → 1365.86] Bend me from my sin.
[1365.86 → 1368.86] Lord, forgive me again.
[1368.86 → 1374.36] And I might be yours alone.
[1374.36 → 1375.36] Put a new fire in my soul.
[1375.36 → 1387.86] Put a new fire in my soul.
[1387.86 → 1391.86] Make this world's miracle.
[1391.86 → 1402.36] And help me see that I am free again.
[1402.36 → 1408.36] Let these broken bones rise up and rejoice.
[1408.36 → 1410.36] Bring the captive home.
[1410.36 → 1413.86] And lift my voice.
[1413.86 → 1416.86] Help my spirit sing.
[1416.86 → 1420.86] Now to Jesus my King.
[1420.86 → 1424.36] Lord, He has forgiven me.
[1424.36 → 1427.36] Lift my fallen face.
[1427.36 → 1429.36] And help me to stand.
[1429.36 → 1434.36] Love me with the grace that comes from your hand.
[1434.36 → 1437.36] Cleanse me from my sin.
[1437.36 → 1439.36] Lord, forgive me again.
[1439.36 → 1455.86] That I might be yours alone.
[1455.86 → 1457.86] You may have a seat.
[1457.86 → 1470.82] Thank you for VIP
[1470.82 → 1475.86] with the bond for human creation.
[1475.86 → 1479.36] Thank you for listening to the She Christifulci.
[1479.36 → 1484.96] He is the heir of all things through whom all God made the universe.
[1485.42 → 1491.36] Jesus is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being,
[1492.26 → 1495.00] sustaining all things by his powerful word.
[1495.00 → 1499.84] And now we read that he has provided purification for sins.
[1500.72 → 1504.44] This points to one of the main teachings in the book of Hebrews.
[1505.22 → 1509.32] When humanity fell into sin, it tainted everything about us.
[1510.20 → 1515.02] We are unable to do anything to make ourselves pure or clean again.
[1515.58 → 1520.60] We need someone far greater than we are in order to be purified of our sin.
[1522.20 → 1527.38] Having been washed and made pure in Christ, however, we are clean.
[1528.02 → 1535.26] We do not need to be purified ever again as long as we believe that Jesus has done this already for us.
[1535.26 → 1541.78] Having been washed and made pure, we are called to live as washed and purified people.
[1541.78 → 1547.44] We are called to put our sin away and to live holy and pure lives.
[1549.14 → 1553.22] Let's take a few moments this morning to confess our sins to Christ
[1553.22 → 1559.28] and to thank him for purifying us through his blood in a moment of silent prayer.
[1559.28 → 1559.42] Let's pray.
[1559.42 → 1560.12] Let's pray.
[1560.12 → 1560.16] Let's pray.
[1560.16 → 1590.14] Thank you.
[1590.16 → 1620.14] Thank you.
[1620.16 → 1625.16] Turn our eyes from evil things.
[1626.34 → 1630.26] Oh Lord, we cast down our idols.
[1631.06 → 1634.08] Give us clean hands.
[1634.38 → 1637.62] Give us pure hearts.
[1638.32 → 1643.66] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[1643.66 → 1647.76] Give us clean hands.
[1648.18 → 1650.66] Give us pure hearts.
[1652.02 → 1656.66] Let us not lift our souls to another.

[1684.38 → 1686.38] Oh God of Jacob.
[1686.38 → 1690.38] Oh God of Jacob.
[1690.38 → 1692.38] We bow our hearts.
[1692.38 → 1696.46] We bend our knees.
[1696.46 → 1700.38] Oh Spirit, come make us a whole.
[1700.38 → 1709.56] We turn our eyes from evil things.
[1709.56 → 1713.56] Oh Lord, we cast down our idols.
[1713.56 → 1715.56] Give us clean hands.
[1715.56 → 1719.56] Give us pure hearts.
[1719.56 → 1725.56] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[1725.56 → 1726.56] Give us clean hands.
[1726.56 → 1729.56] Give us clean hands.
[1729.56 → 1732.56] Give us pure hearts.
[1732.56 → 1734.56] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[1734.56 → 1739.56] Let us not lift our souls to another.
[1739.56 → 1748.56] Oh God, let us be a generation that seeks, that seeks your face.
[1748.56 → 1751.56] Oh God of Jacob.
[1751.56 → 1761.56] Oh God, let us be a generation that seeks, that seeks your face.
[1761.56 → 1762.56] Oh God of Jacob.
[1762.56 → 1763.56] Oh God of Jacob.
[1763.56 → 1764.56] Oh God of Jacob.
[1764.56 → 1766.56] Oh God of Jacob.
[1766.56 → 1769.56] We bow our hearts.
[1769.56 → 1774.56] We bend our knees.
[1774.56 → 1783.56] Oh Spirit, come make us a whole.
[1783.56 → 1788.56] Please stand and join us as we continue singing the song, The River.
[1788.56 → 1789.56] We do believe in this forever.
[1789.56 → 1798.56] Our way to when we feel ś
[1798.56 → 1799.06] We stand and join us as we come, And come-in- west you,
[1799.06 → 1803.56] And in this unfit song that shines-forwarded.
[1803.56 → 1819.38] To that river I am going
[1819.38 → 1825.44] Bringing sins I cannot bear
[1825.44 → 1829.76] Come and cleanse me
[1829.76 → 1832.86] God forgive me
[1832.86 → 1838.72] Lord I need to meet you there
[1838.72 → 1841.74] In these waters
[1841.74 → 1844.68] Feeling mercy

[2495.72 → 2496.76] Let's go to our Lord in prayer.
[2499.76 → 2512.18] Our Father in heaven, it is with Thanksgiving in our hearts that you have gathered us together in your house to worship you in freedom, to give you praise through our songs and meditations and to hear your word proclaimed.
[2512.18 → 2533.60] Along with the psalmist, we proclaim, it is good to give thanks to the Lord, to sing praises to your name, O Mosaic, to declare your loving kindness in the morning, your faithfulness every night on an instrument of ten strings on the lute and on the harp with harmonious sound.
[2533.60 → 2537.72] For you, Lord, have made me glad through your work.
[2538.60 → 2541.24] I will triumph in the works of your hands.
[2542.48 → 2545.78] Yet, Lord, we confess that we have not followed in your commandments.
[2546.50 → 2548.34] We have not lived according to your word.
[2549.72 → 2550.58] Forgive us, Lord.
[2551.06 → 2552.56] Renew your spirit within us.
[2552.78 → 2553.90] Give us godly wisdom.
[2555.10 → 2556.56] Teach us to trust in you.
[2557.28 → 2560.14] Help us to honour you in all that we do.
[2560.14 → 2566.48] Lord, we lift to you members of our church family who are living with health concerns.
[2568.02 → 2574.40] Please be with our sister, Lena Cheema, as her health is failing and the family is looking for care for her.
[2575.36 → 2578.22] We know she's in your hands, Lord.
[2578.72 → 2581.16] Provide for Was, Lena, and her children.
[2582.12 → 2584.58] A loving place where Lena can receive support.
[2585.06 → 2589.34] Be with the family, especially now, as they face uncertainty in Lena's health.
[2590.14 → 2595.22] Father, many in our family are dealing with cancer.
[2596.02 → 2601.32] We pray for John Van Bur drake as he begins treatment and ask for complete healing.
[2601.32 → 2607.60] We pray for Jerry Jansen's daughter, Tessa, as she is undergoing tests for cancer.
[2608.60 → 2610.48] We pray for a good prognosis.
[2611.62 → 2620.64] We pray for Elise Adenauer's father, Doug, and Class Tastemaker's daughter, Tanya, as they both struggle with stage 4 cancer.
[2621.48 → 2623.94] Lord, you are in control in all these situations.
[2623.94 → 2630.36] Help these families to put their trust and their hope in you and give them your peace.
[2631.36 → 2634.90] Give John, Tessa, Doug, and Tanya courage.
[2635.74 → 2637.70] The ability to endure treatment.
[2638.38 → 2639.98] Your presence when they feel alone.
[2640.86 → 2643.94] Love and support of family and healing by your will.
[2643.94 → 2649.94] Be with those dealing with physical limitations, loneliness, anxiety.
[2650.42 → 2652.26] Lift them up by your spirit.
[2653.28 → 2654.64] Relieve sadness and worry.
[2655.84 → 2664.66] As we anticipate your word, grant to Pastor Chris your spirit that your truth may find open hearts and open minds.
[2664.66 → 2675.92] And Lord Jesus, as we strive to imitate you on this earth, equip us with your spirit so that your light will continue to shine at Emmanuel in our homes and in this community.
[2676.88 → 2678.64] Our souls wait for you, Lord.
[2679.00 → 2680.62] You are our help and our shield.
[2680.94 → 2685.94] Our hearts shall rejoice in you because we have trusted in your holy name.
[2686.94 → 2691.34] Let your mercy, O Lord, be upon us just as we hope in you.
[2691.96 → 2693.74] In Jesus' name, amen.
[2694.66 → 2695.66] Amen.
[2713.80 → 2720.22] This morning we're going to continue in our preaching series here at Emmanuel.
[2720.22 → 2732.40] Emmanuel, we have been in the book of Thessalonians, the first letter that the Apostle Paul wrote to the church of Thessalonica.
[2733.96 → 2738.48] We're living in this book for a while, and then we'll move into the second letter as well.
[2738.64 → 2742.18] Today we're going to read from 1 Thessalonians 4.
[2742.36 → 2744.64] We're going to read verses 1 through 8.
[2744.64 → 2752.72] So I encourage you, if you have a Bible, to open it up and to keep that open as we go through the message because we'll be referring back.
[2753.04 → 2757.40] If you're looking for a Bible, there's a couple in the ladder shelves at the back there.
[2757.52 → 2759.86] You can grab one and follow along.
[2760.40 → 2765.10] Or you can turn your device on and get your Bible app open and read along there.
[2765.10 → 2777.20] Before we dive in, or as we start, let's do so by reading together from God's Word to us in 1 Thessalonians 4.
[2777.20 → 2791.28] As for other matters, brothers and sisters, we instructed you how to live in order to please God as, in fact, you are living.
[2792.40 → 2797.32] Now we ask you and urge you in the Lord Jesus to do this more and more,
[2797.32 → 2802.66] for you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.
[2802.66 → 2811.54] It is God's will that you should be sanctified, that you should avoid sexual immorality,
[2811.54 → 2816.86] that each of you should learn to control your body in a way that is holy and honourable,
[2817.40 → 2820.76] not in passionate lusts like the pagans who do not know God,
[2821.44 → 2826.90] and that in this matter no one should wrong or take advantage of a brother or sister.
[2826.90 → 2833.76] The Lord will punish all those who commit such sins as we told you and warned you before.
[2834.76 → 2839.28] For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life.
[2840.08 → 2845.50] Therefore, anyone who rejects this instruction does not reject a human being,
[2845.64 → 2850.58] but God, the very God who gives you his Holy Spirit.
[2851.18 → 2852.56] This is the word of the Lord.
[2856.90 → 2868.00] One of the repeated themes that has kind of come to the surface from sociologists
[2868.00 → 2874.12] who look at the modern state of Christianity in the West
[2874.12 → 2880.62] is this idea that's been commonly called the rise of the nuns.
[2880.62 → 2887.00] And so the nuns are not the Roman Catholic Church order of women who wear habits
[2887.00 → 2892.20] and devote themselves to the Lord, but nuns as in N-O-N-E-S.
[2892.68 → 2896.68] That is people who on the demographic surveys that they get to fill out
[2896.68 → 2900.12] where it says, what is your religion, they check the box, none.
[2900.90 → 2902.66] They have no religion.
[2902.66 → 2908.24] This demographic in the West in the last number of years
[2908.24 → 2914.00] has increased at an exponential and, for many people, alarming rate.
[2914.00 → 2922.42] When you dive into those statistics and people like Cinnamon and the Barn Group
[2922.42 → 2931.06] or Bobby in Canada and looking at hemorrhaging faith or transforming faith studies,
[2931.62 → 2937.12] when you look into these numbers, one of the reasons given for this shift
[2937.12 → 2942.22] is people who, even though they may have grown up in a church community,
[2942.38 → 2946.64] they may have grown up in a faith community, but no longer professed that faith,
[2946.70 → 2949.92] is because they looked around, and they asked themselves,
[2950.34 → 2951.64] what difference is this making?
[2953.48 → 2958.64] And they didn't see any change in the people who professed to be Christian in their lives.
[2959.08 → 2963.76] They didn't see it making any difference concretely in the way they behaved in the world,
[2963.76 → 2965.56] in the way they thought about the world,
[2965.56 → 2969.04] and in the way they talked about things going on in the world.
[2970.36 → 2972.80] What difference does it make?
[2973.92 → 2976.24] This is a really important question for us
[2976.24 → 2980.34] as we are digging into the lives and stories of faith
[2980.34 → 2983.86] that Paul talks about here in the church in Thessalonica.
[2984.54 → 2986.70] What difference does it make?
[2988.50 → 2991.82] It won't surprise you, I think, to learn
[2991.82 → 2997.74] that this makes a world, literally, a world of difference.
[2998.66 → 3002.06] The sort of theme that I want to operate under this morning
[3002.06 → 3005.44] is the idea that God has sanctified you,
[3005.96 → 3007.68] and I'll define that term in a little bit,
[3008.40 → 3011.98] and so live as one set apart.
[3012.66 → 3014.90] Live as one sanctified.
[3014.90 → 3021.08] Paul, he opens this section,
[3021.28 → 3023.04] and he continues this section
[3023.04 → 3026.76] using the same kind of language that he has been throughout.
[3026.88 → 3029.00] If you've been with us in this series,
[3029.24 → 3032.30] you know that Paul has been really encouraged
[3032.30 → 3036.56] by the reception of the gospel
[3036.56 → 3040.22] and the lives of faith for these people in Thessalonica.
[3040.22 → 3044.30] And his letter really is a celebration
[3044.30 → 3047.88] of that good reception of faith.
[3048.32 → 3051.08] And he grounds his encouragement in this part
[3051.08 → 3054.14] in what he sees this church already doing.
[3054.88 → 3057.18] Maybe you noticed in verse 1.
[3058.06 → 3058.34] He writes,
[3058.46 → 3061.52] As for other matters, brothers and sisters,
[3061.76 → 3064.98] we instructed you how to live in order to please God
[3064.98 → 3068.18] as, in fact, you are doing.
[3068.18 → 3071.48] As, in fact, you are doing.
[3071.58 → 3074.20] We told you how, and you're doing it.
[3074.76 → 3076.64] We asked, and you answered.
[3077.84 → 3081.20] Now, one of the reasons why I find Thessalonians
[3081.20 → 3083.62] so compelling and so beautiful
[3083.62 → 3087.48] is that Paul is so obviously excited
[3087.48 → 3091.04] about what God is doing in and through this church,
[3091.18 → 3093.08] what God is doing in their midst,
[3093.20 → 3095.58] and he celebrates that with them.
[3098.18 → 3103.26] Now, I think we can apply that same frame
[3103.26 → 3105.32] of celebration and encouragement
[3105.32 → 3108.22] in our midst here as well.
[3109.24 → 3112.44] I really believe that God is continuing
[3112.44 → 3114.70] to do something in our midst,
[3114.82 → 3117.06] and it's really exciting to see it.
[3118.24 → 3120.58] People are asking hard questions of faith.
[3121.38 → 3123.00] People are coming to new faith.
[3123.00 → 3125.54] People are digging deeper in their faith,
[3125.76 → 3127.56] in and through all the various things
[3127.56 → 3130.08] and relationships that are circling around here.
[3130.94 → 3132.60] Lives are being shared.
[3132.88 → 3134.44] Burdens are being shared.
[3135.58 → 3137.66] Suffering is being entered into,
[3137.92 → 3140.70] and people don't have to struggle in isolation.
[3141.70 → 3143.82] One of the ways you see that is meals are being made.
[3144.58 → 3146.40] Dinner tables are being opened up.
[3146.54 → 3149.32] Homes are being opened up for people to come into,
[3149.32 → 3151.02] even strangers.
[3152.74 → 3154.76] We heard from our deacons earlier, right?
[3154.84 → 3156.38] Our deacons, if you don't know,
[3156.88 → 3159.62] our deacons are paying rent for some people.
[3160.14 → 3161.08] They're buying groceries.
[3161.36 → 3163.64] They're offsetting the cost of counselling.
[3164.04 → 3166.94] They're helping people with rides to and from church,
[3166.98 → 3168.40] but also from different appointments
[3168.40 → 3170.20] and the like in their lives.
[3171.24 → 3173.40] Young adults with the work of Josh
[3173.40 → 3176.16] and others are studying the Bible together.
[3176.78 → 3179.48] They're being trained as missionaries, right?
[3179.52 → 3180.84] They're helping each other move.
[3182.02 → 3183.42] Youth with Pastor Kevin
[3183.42 → 3185.80] are asking hard questions of faith,
[3185.88 → 3187.22] and in asking those questions,
[3187.50 → 3189.82] are really wrestling with and submitting to
[3189.82 → 3191.46] what the Word of God says.
[3192.30 → 3195.18] Mentors are walking with youth through life struggles,
[3195.52 → 3197.14] and there's a group among us
[3197.14 → 3200.12] who's getting ready to go to Mexico for 10 days,
[3200.12 → 3204.60] and that's actually just on the surface, right?
[3204.62 → 3205.74] When you dig deeper into it,
[3205.76 → 3207.40] there's so much going on here.
[3207.82 → 3210.54] I really believe that God is at work here,
[3210.64 → 3212.64] and I hope that you can see it too,
[3212.82 → 3215.24] and I hope that you want to be part of it,
[3215.24 → 3220.98] and that's what Paul is continuing to urge the church
[3220.98 → 3223.52] in this letter towards, right?
[3223.52 → 3227.52] To be part of God's continued work among them.
[3227.52 → 3230.32] You're doing it, he says,
[3230.98 → 3232.36] and now keep doing it.
[3233.06 → 3235.22] You've listened and are living.
[3235.84 → 3237.40] Now do it more and more.
[3239.88 → 3243.06] Now we ask you and urge you in the Lord,
[3243.24 → 3245.24] do this more and more.
[3245.74 → 3247.14] Don't stop growing.
[3247.32 → 3248.90] Don't stop being transformed.
[3249.32 → 3249.98] Don't stop.
[3250.12 → 3250.70] Don't settle.
[3250.86 → 3251.66] Don't get comfortable.
[3251.86 → 3252.60] Don't get lazy.
[3253.00 → 3253.76] Don't be idle.
[3254.12 → 3255.04] Keep growing.
[3255.72 → 3257.22] Keep wrestling out obedience.
[3257.22 → 3259.52] Keep submitting your life to God.
[3261.44 → 3262.82] Because it's easy to think,
[3263.26 → 3265.22] I'm doing enough.
[3266.40 → 3267.56] It's easy to think,
[3267.66 → 3268.82] I'm obedient enough.
[3268.90 → 3269.78] I'm good enough.
[3270.04 → 3271.54] And let me be really, really clear.
[3273.20 → 3275.06] This is especially true
[3275.06 → 3277.36] if you are a Christian.
[3279.54 → 3280.84] Because if you're not a Christian,
[3281.14 → 3282.12] you probably don't care.
[3282.12 → 3284.22] But if you are,
[3284.78 → 3287.48] and perhaps even more so,
[3287.56 → 3289.12] if you are a mature Christian,
[3289.96 → 3291.30] this is for you.
[3293.04 → 3294.32] Because I know I do this, right?
[3294.40 → 3295.70] You look at your life,
[3296.40 → 3298.26] and you look at it before God,
[3298.34 → 3300.26] or before you took God seriously,
[3300.56 → 3302.70] and you compare that to your life now,
[3302.90 → 3304.88] and that transformation is incredible,
[3305.18 → 3305.58] Lord willing.
[3305.58 → 3309.12] For instance,
[3309.22 → 3310.42] I look back on my own life,
[3311.64 → 3316.06] and I see all sorts of patterns of behaviour,
[3316.26 → 3317.20] of binge-drinking,
[3317.38 → 3318.70] and recreational drug use,
[3318.80 → 3319.88] of addictive behaviours,
[3320.60 → 3320.88] of womanizing,
[3320.88 → 3322.82] and so much more.
[3323.38 → 3325.12] And underneath all of that,
[3325.18 → 3325.88] I see selfishness,
[3326.56 → 3327.24] and apathy,
[3327.58 → 3328.68] I see sloth,
[3328.76 → 3329.86] and I see pride.
[3330.42 → 3331.56] So much pride.
[3333.68 → 3334.56] But now,
[3335.20 → 3335.94] praise Jesus,
[3336.14 → 3337.08] I look at my life,
[3337.22 → 3339.40] and those things that once defined me,
[3339.82 → 3342.88] those things that I had once been bound to as a slave,
[3343.24 → 3345.10] none of that is part of my life.
[3345.24 → 3347.48] And God has grown in me
[3347.48 → 3350.22] a deep love and heart to care.
[3351.14 → 3353.18] And I take the words of Jesus seriously
[3353.18 → 3355.72] when he says that I want to serve,
[3355.72 → 3356.92] and not be served.
[3356.92 → 3359.36] But now,
[3360.48 → 3361.14] candidly,
[3361.80 → 3362.46] and honestly,
[3363.36 → 3365.74] the more clearly
[3365.74 → 3369.16] you see that kind of transformation in your life,
[3369.90 → 3371.90] the more easily
[3371.90 → 3375.14] we can convince ourselves that it's enough.
[3377.34 → 3379.24] The more easily we can say something like,
[3379.32 → 3381.04] oh, I've already changed so much,
[3381.56 → 3382.82] I don't have to worry about that.
[3382.82 → 3385.80] We can say things like,
[3385.90 → 3387.36] I'll never be perfect,
[3387.94 → 3389.00] so, you know,
[3389.08 → 3389.84] this thing here,
[3389.92 → 3391.68] that's not really affecting other people,
[3391.94 → 3393.14] I'm just going to leave that be.
[3395.58 → 3396.94] We get perfect
[3396.94 → 3398.48] at convincing ourselves
[3398.48 → 3400.48] that a little bit of compromise
[3400.48 → 3401.44] is okay.
[3404.74 → 3405.54] And you know what?
[3405.54 → 3408.32] If it was just me
[3408.32 → 3409.38] standing here in front of you
[3409.38 → 3410.12] asking that,
[3411.56 → 3413.18] you could settle for something less.
[3414.34 → 3414.72] Honestly,
[3414.84 → 3416.00] if it was just Paul
[3416.00 → 3417.04] asking you,
[3417.48 → 3418.86] he would probably understand.
[3420.12 → 3421.08] But it's not.
[3422.08 → 3423.24] Look with me at verse 2.
[3424.54 → 3425.42] For you know
[3425.42 → 3426.30] what instructions
[3426.30 → 3427.22] we gave you
[3427.22 → 3428.46] by the authority
[3428.46 → 3430.46] of the Lord Jesus.
[3430.46 → 3432.28] It is God's will
[3432.28 → 3433.68] that you should be sanctified.
[3433.68 → 3433.76] God.
[3436.08 → 3437.72] Jesus is asking.
[3438.68 → 3440.00] Jesus is revealing
[3440.00 → 3441.08] God's will.
[3441.92 → 3443.04] And that's the thing, right?
[3443.12 → 3444.22] Jesus is asking
[3444.22 → 3445.22] and urging
[3445.22 → 3446.56] and telling us
[3446.56 → 3447.56] the call
[3447.56 → 3448.68] to live more
[3448.68 → 3449.56] and more
[3449.56 → 3451.44] into this way of being.
[3452.46 → 3452.78] Right?
[3452.82 → 3454.16] This isn't my call to you.
[3455.48 → 3455.68] Right?
[3455.68 → 3456.64] I would want to compromise.
[3458.90 → 3460.38] The call is God's.
[3460.38 → 3463.86] God's word says to us
[3463.86 → 3465.94] take every thought captive
[3465.94 → 3467.62] to make it obedient to Christ.
[3468.56 → 3468.66] Right?
[3468.74 → 3469.32] Jesus says
[3469.32 → 3470.00] be perfect
[3470.00 → 3471.22] as your heavenly father
[3471.22 → 3472.00] is perfect.
[3473.00 → 3474.08] Or we read in Romans
[3474.08 → 3475.06] by the spirit
[3475.06 → 3475.92] put to death
[3475.92 → 3477.34] the deeds of the flesh.
[3477.88 → 3479.24] This is life.
[3480.16 → 3481.06] Now as you hear these words
[3481.06 → 3481.68] as you see them
[3481.68 → 3482.32] there on the screen
[3482.32 → 3483.42] put to death.
[3483.90 → 3484.76] Be perfect.
[3484.76 → 3486.58] Take every thought captive.
[3487.52 → 3489.06] These aren't half measures.
[3490.38 → 3490.70] Right?
[3490.78 → 3493.00] You can't kinda kill sin.
[3494.36 → 3495.34] It's either dead or it's not.
[3496.58 → 3498.32] Perfect is perfect.
[3498.66 → 3499.44] There's no less.
[3500.04 → 3501.16] Or it's not perfect.
[3501.94 → 3502.08] Right?
[3502.22 → 3503.96] Every must mean every
[3503.96 → 3504.92] or it's not.
[3506.98 → 3507.54] Instead
[3507.54 → 3508.60] right
[3508.60 → 3509.16] we read
[3509.16 → 3510.52] it's God's will
[3510.52 → 3512.36] that you should be sanctified.
[3513.74 → 3515.12] This is God's will
[3515.12 → 3515.86] for us.
[3516.80 → 3517.76] And so that word
[3517.76 → 3518.84] sanctified
[3518.84 → 3519.84] sanctified
[3519.84 → 3520.74] I suggest to you
[3520.74 → 3522.40] is really important
[3522.40 → 3524.20] for understanding
[3524.20 → 3525.18] the call
[3525.18 → 3526.06] in this text.
[3528.46 → 3529.58] Now that word
[3529.58 → 3530.52] sanctified
[3530.52 → 3532.28] comes from
[3532.28 → 3533.66] a Greek word
[3533.66 → 3535.22] that's in the holiness
[3535.22 → 3536.46] group of words
[3536.46 → 3537.18] in this text
[3537.18 → 3537.76] it's
[3537.76 → 3538.86] Mafiosos
[3538.86 → 3539.96] but agios
[3539.96 → 3541.20] is the word
[3541.20 → 3542.20] that's used there.
[3542.60 → 3543.64] It means holy.
[3543.64 → 3546.56] Maybe you are familiar
[3546.56 → 3547.16] with the word
[3547.16 → 3548.06] hagiography
[3548.06 → 3548.74] that's the
[3548.74 → 3549.74] story of
[3549.74 → 3550.26] or the making
[3550.26 → 3550.90] of saints.
[3551.66 → 3551.76] Right?
[3551.92 → 3552.42] Agios
[3552.42 → 3553.74] is the connection there.
[3554.76 → 3555.68] Depending on your
[3555.68 → 3556.60] Bible translation
[3556.60 → 3558.20] what you read there
[3558.20 → 3559.42] might say something like
[3559.42 → 3560.74] that you become holy
[3560.74 → 3561.68] or that you should
[3561.68 → 3562.54] be sanctified
[3562.54 → 3564.36] or this is God's will
[3564.36 → 3564.88] for you
[3564.88 → 3565.96] your sanctification.
[3567.00 → 3567.08] Right?
[3567.10 → 3568.22] The word holy
[3568.22 → 3568.64] means
[3569.16 → 3570.28] to be set apart.
[3570.50 → 3570.96] It means
[3570.96 → 3572.20] to be consecrated
[3572.20 → 3574.00] for a divine purpose.
[3578.24 → 3578.80] Okay.
[3579.70 → 3580.48] So for
[3580.48 → 3581.60] just a minute
[3581.60 → 3582.90] or five
[3582.90 → 3584.04] we're going to do
[3584.04 → 3584.50] a little bit of
[3584.50 → 3585.28] doctrine work
[3585.28 → 3585.96] because it lays
[3585.96 → 3586.68] the foundation
[3586.68 → 3587.90] for us here.
[3589.60 → 3590.42] And so
[3590.42 → 3591.88] first
[3591.88 → 3592.64] let's clarify
[3592.64 → 3593.62] some terms.
[3594.56 → 3595.58] As we talk
[3595.58 → 3596.44] about salvation
[3596.44 → 3597.20] as we read
[3597.20 → 3597.96] about salvation
[3597.96 → 3599.14] in the Bible
[3599.14 → 3600.26] there are two
[3600.26 → 3601.32] important terms
[3601.32 → 3602.06] that are used
[3602.06 → 3602.44] there
[3602.44 → 3603.38] and those terms
[3603.38 → 3604.26] are justification
[3604.26 → 3606.62] and sanctification.
[3608.42 → 3608.64] Now
[3608.64 → 3609.40] justification
[3609.40 → 3611.04] is the word
[3611.04 → 3611.80] that's used
[3611.80 → 3613.30] to talk about
[3613.30 → 3614.08] the legal
[3614.08 → 3614.94] declaration
[3614.94 → 3616.08] of my
[3616.08 → 3616.88] redemption
[3616.88 → 3618.30] of my salvation
[3618.30 → 3619.98] based on
[3619.98 → 3620.44] the
[3620.44 → 3621.86] vicarious
[3621.86 → 3622.70] satisfaction
[3622.70 → 3624.20] of Jesus Christ.
[3625.34 → 3625.72] And so
[3625.72 → 3626.66] as we say
[3626.66 → 3627.52] regularly here
[3627.52 → 3628.48] because Jesus
[3628.48 → 3629.40] lived the life
[3629.40 → 3630.02] I should have
[3630.02 → 3630.34] lived
[3630.34 → 3631.20] and died
[3631.20 → 3631.70] the death
[3631.70 → 3632.08] that I
[3632.08 → 3632.58] deserved
[3632.58 → 3633.70] I am
[3633.70 → 3634.44] justified
[3634.44 → 3635.80] before God
[3635.80 → 3636.54] by grace
[3636.54 → 3637.50] through faith.
[3637.60 → 3638.18] That's the thing
[3638.18 → 3638.98] about justification
[3638.98 → 3639.52] right?
[3639.58 → 3640.48] It comes by grace
[3640.48 → 3640.84] alone
[3640.84 → 3641.58] through faith
[3641.58 → 3641.94] alone
[3641.94 → 3642.68] in Christ
[3642.68 → 3643.06] alone.
[3644.80 → 3645.48] Justification
[3645.48 → 3646.44] changes
[3646.44 → 3648.84] your status
[3648.84 → 3650.42] your reality
[3650.42 → 3651.76] before God.
[3652.24 → 3653.00] It moves us
[3653.00 → 3653.62] from what the Bible
[3653.62 → 3655.02] calls by nature
[3655.02 → 3656.04] objects of wrath
[3656.04 → 3657.26] to being lavishly
[3657.26 → 3658.10] loved children
[3658.10 → 3659.24] of God.
[3661.44 → 3662.04] Sanctification
[3662.04 → 3663.54] is the word
[3663.54 → 3664.44] that comes
[3664.44 → 3665.42] almost immediately
[3665.42 → 3666.14] on the heels
[3666.14 → 3666.96] of justification
[3666.96 → 3668.44] and sanctification
[3668.44 → 3669.72] really is the
[3669.72 → 3670.42] application
[3670.42 → 3671.88] of the
[3671.88 → 3672.50] declaration.
[3673.82 → 3673.94] Right?
[3673.98 → 3674.46] It's the being
[3674.46 → 3675.54] moved from here
[3675.54 → 3676.40] to here
[3676.40 → 3677.24] because of the
[3677.24 → 3677.68] decree.
[3678.74 → 3679.24] Now also
[3679.24 → 3680.02] let me hear this
[3680.02 → 3680.64] very clearly
[3680.64 → 3681.60] sanctification
[3681.60 → 3683.04] is also
[3683.04 → 3684.10] an act
[3684.10 → 3684.84] of God's
[3684.84 → 3685.30] grace
[3685.30 → 3686.40] that moves
[3686.40 → 3686.72] us
[3686.72 → 3687.56] to cooperate
[3687.56 → 3688.40] with what
[3688.40 → 3689.04] God is doing
[3689.04 → 3689.80] in the world.
[3692.06 → 3693.66] Now popularly
[3693.66 → 3695.78] people think
[3695.78 → 3696.88] about sanctification
[3696.88 → 3698.16] kind of in
[3698.16 → 3699.04] two dimensions.
[3699.86 → 3699.98] Right?
[3700.04 → 3700.52] The idea is
[3700.52 → 3701.30] this is where
[3701.30 → 3701.84] you start
[3701.84 → 3703.30] and this is
[3703.30 → 3703.58] where you're
[3703.58 → 3703.92] going.
[3705.24 → 3706.72] But biblically
[3706.72 → 3708.30] sanctification
[3708.30 → 3709.92] has a more
[3709.92 → 3710.98] three-dimensional
[3710.98 → 3711.96] picture.
[3711.96 → 3713.74] sanctification
[3713.74 → 3714.76] as we survey
[3714.76 → 3715.34] the whole
[3715.34 → 3715.94] of the New
[3715.94 → 3716.38] Testament
[3716.38 → 3717.84] comes with
[3717.84 → 3718.54] what some
[3718.54 → 3718.92] people have
[3718.92 → 3719.16] called
[3719.16 → 3720.10] positional
[3720.10 → 3721.36] or definitional
[3721.36 → 3723.38] realities
[3723.38 → 3725.14] and progressive
[3725.14 → 3725.94] that is the
[3725.94 → 3726.48] moving and
[3726.48 → 3727.04] growing in
[3727.04 → 3727.62] realities
[3727.62 → 3729.02] and perfected
[3729.02 → 3730.16] realities.
[3731.42 → 3732.10] Positional
[3732.10 → 3732.82] progressive
[3732.82 → 3733.98] and perfected
[3733.98 → 3735.40] these have
[3735.40 → 3735.68] sort of
[3735.68 → 3736.20] past
[3736.20 → 3736.96] present
[3736.96 → 3737.78] and future
[3737.78 → 3738.40] aspects
[3738.40 → 3739.32] to them
[3739.32 → 3740.88] and actually
[3740.88 → 3741.86] all three
[3741.86 → 3742.86] uses of
[3742.86 → 3743.26] the word
[3743.26 → 3744.02] sanctification
[3744.02 → 3744.72] show up
[3744.72 → 3744.98] in the
[3744.98 → 3745.28] book of
[3745.28 → 3745.96] Thessalonians.
[3747.36 → 3747.62] And so
[3747.62 → 3748.10] let me do
[3748.10 → 3748.56] this survey
[3748.56 → 3748.88] with you
[3748.88 → 3749.38] really quick.
[3750.90 → 3751.38] Positional
[3751.38 → 3752.32] sanctification
[3752.32 → 3753.94] shows up
[3753.94 → 3755.24] in 2 Thessalonians
[3755.24 → 3756.36] 2 verse 13
[3756.36 → 3757.42] where we read
[3757.42 → 3786.40] that is what
[3786.40 → 3786.88] some of you
[3786.88 → 3787.18] were
[3787.18 → 3787.90] but you
[3787.90 → 3788.68] were washed
[3788.68 → 3789.20] you were
[3789.20 → 3789.90] sanctified
[3789.90 → 3790.34] you were
[3790.34 → 3790.88] justified
[3790.88 → 3792.02] in the name
[3792.02 → 3792.52] of the Lord
[3792.52 → 3793.32] Jesus Christ
[3793.32 → 3794.14] and by the
[3794.14 → 3794.54] Spirit of
[3794.54 → 3794.96] our God.
[3795.14 → 3795.68] There you see
[3795.68 → 3796.18] those close
[3796.18 → 3796.62] connection
[3796.62 → 3797.00] of those
[3797.00 → 3797.56] two terms.
[3799.40 → 3800.20] Then we have
[3800.20 → 3800.78] progressive
[3800.78 → 3802.24] sanctification
[3802.24 → 3803.06] this shows up
[3803.06 → 3804.18] in 1 Thessalonians
[3804.18 → 3804.78] 4 3
[3804.78 → 3805.80] our text
[3805.80 → 3806.86] where we read
[3806.86 → 3807.48] it's God's
[3807.48 → 3808.22] will that you
[3808.22 → 3808.78] should be
[3808.78 → 3809.38] sanctified
[3809.38 → 3809.78] that you
[3809.78 → 3810.40] should avoid
[3810.40 → 3811.04] sexual
[3811.04 → 3811.92] immorality
[3811.92 → 3812.24] that you
[3812.24 → 3812.62] should be
[3812.62 → 3813.54] growing
[3813.54 → 3814.64] in what
[3814.64 → 3815.28] your obedience
[3815.28 → 3815.92] to God
[3815.92 → 3816.80] looks like.
[3818.04 → 3818.74] And then
[3818.74 → 3819.40] thirdly
[3819.40 → 3820.12] we have
[3820.12 → 3821.48] perfected
[3821.48 → 3822.54] sanctification.
[3822.88 → 3823.50] This shows up
[3823.50 → 3824.88] in 1 Thessalonians
[3824.88 → 3825.32] 5
[3825.32 → 3826.72] a blessing
[3826.72 → 3827.26] that we have
[3827.26 → 3827.72] read here
[3827.72 → 3828.74] in this series.
[3828.90 → 3829.30] May God
[3829.30 → 3829.76] himself
[3829.76 → 3830.24] the God
[3830.24 → 3830.70] of peace
[3830.70 → 3831.80] sanctify you
[3831.80 → 3832.18] through
[3832.18 → 3832.96] and through
[3832.96 → 3833.66] may your
[3833.66 → 3834.22] whole spirit
[3834.22 → 3834.82] and soul
[3834.82 → 3835.32] and body
[3835.32 → 3835.76] be kept
[3835.76 → 3836.38] blameless
[3836.38 → 3836.78] at the
[3836.78 → 3837.04] coming
[3837.04 → 3837.42] of our
[3837.42 → 3837.66] Lord
[3837.66 → 3837.96] Jesus
[3837.96 → 3838.42] Christ
[3838.42 → 3839.24] the one
[3839.24 → 3839.90] who calls
[3839.90 → 3840.06] you
[3840.06 → 3840.76] is faithful
[3840.76 → 3841.70] and he
[3841.70 → 3842.70] will do
[3842.70 → 3842.96] it.
[3843.64 → 3844.02] Right?
[3844.06 → 3844.42] The idea
[3844.42 → 3844.86] there that
[3844.86 → 3845.86] sanctification
[3845.86 → 3847.40] is connected
[3847.40 → 3848.34] to the
[3848.34 → 3849.04] coming of
[3849.04 → 3849.34] our
[3849.34 → 3849.74] Lord
[3849.74 → 3850.48] Jesus
[3850.48 → 3851.22] Christ.
[3853.08 → 3853.34] So
[3853.34 → 3854.42] we're going
[3854.42 → 3854.64] to keep
[3854.64 → 3855.00] doing this
[3855.00 → 3855.52] doctrine work
[3855.52 → 3855.92] for a minute.
[3856.40 → 3856.48] Right?
[3856.68 → 3857.20] Positional
[3857.20 → 3858.08] sanctification
[3858.08 → 3859.66] is the
[3859.66 → 3860.34] biblical
[3860.34 → 3861.18] idea that
[3861.18 → 3861.94] refers to
[3861.94 → 3862.84] the status
[3862.84 → 3864.30] of believers
[3864.30 → 3866.32] as irreversibly
[3866.32 → 3867.40] set apart
[3867.40 → 3868.16] to God
[3868.16 → 3869.16] through our
[3869.16 → 3869.78] union with
[3869.78 → 3870.24] Christ
[3870.24 → 3871.60] because of
[3871.60 → 3872.04] God's
[3872.04 → 3872.42] decree
[3872.42 → 3872.76] of
[3872.76 → 3873.44] justification.
[3874.72 → 3874.90] Right?
[3874.94 → 3875.18] So this
[3875.18 → 3875.74] refers to
[3875.74 → 3876.20] the same
[3876.20 → 3877.12] reality as
[3877.12 → 3877.64] justification
[3877.64 → 3878.70] but not
[3878.70 → 3879.08] in the
[3879.08 → 3879.74] legal or
[3879.74 → 3880.18] forensic
[3880.18 → 3880.72] terms
[3880.72 → 3881.58] but rather
[3881.58 → 3882.40] in terms
[3882.40 → 3882.72] of our
[3882.72 → 3883.26] union.
[3883.96 → 3884.06] Right?
[3884.08 → 3884.36] In terms
[3884.36 → 3884.62] of our
[3884.62 → 3885.34] new status
[3885.34 → 3885.74] of being
[3885.74 → 3886.46] set apart
[3886.46 → 3886.80] of being
[3886.80 → 3887.68] consecrated
[3887.68 → 3888.50] for God's
[3888.50 → 3889.24] holy purposes.
[3890.08 → 3890.68] There's a
[3890.68 → 3891.26] relationship
[3891.26 → 3892.00] between the
[3892.00 → 3892.46] judge
[3892.46 → 3893.02] and the
[3893.02 → 3893.50] acquitted
[3893.50 → 3894.24] that the
[3894.24 → 3895.16] language of
[3895.16 → 3895.86] positional
[3895.86 → 3896.64] sanctification
[3896.64 → 3897.34] conveys.
[3898.36 → 3898.58] At the
[3898.58 → 3899.82] moment of
[3899.82 → 3900.36] justification
[3900.36 → 3901.42] we are
[3901.42 → 3902.22] sanctified.
[3902.40 → 3902.60] That is
[3902.60 → 3902.80] we're
[3902.80 → 3903.46] consecrated
[3903.46 → 3903.96] and devoted
[3903.96 → 3904.44] to God.
[3905.10 → 3905.52] And what's
[3905.52 → 3906.16] really important
[3906.16 → 3907.06] is to see
[3907.06 → 3907.78] that this
[3907.78 → 3908.20] way,
[3908.36 → 3908.88] this idea
[3908.88 → 3909.82] of positional
[3909.82 → 3910.48] sanctification
[3910.48 → 3911.42] is the
[3911.42 → 3911.84] way that
[3911.84 → 3912.26] the Bible
[3912.26 → 3913.26] usually
[3913.26 → 3914.40] uses the
[3914.40 → 3914.66] word
[3914.66 → 3915.56] sanctification.
[3916.86 → 3917.40] Overwhelmingly
[3917.40 → 3917.96] this is the
[3917.96 → 3918.46] dominant
[3918.46 → 3919.82] understanding.
[3921.48 → 3921.62] Right?
[3921.66 → 3922.18] This act
[3922.18 → 3922.92] has a purpose
[3922.92 → 3923.74] that is beyond
[3923.74 → 3924.34] the event
[3924.34 → 3924.94] itself.
[3925.50 → 3926.02] That is,
[3926.12 → 3926.40] you are
[3926.40 → 3927.12] set apart
[3927.12 → 3928.06] to live
[3928.06 → 3928.60] transforms
[3928.60 → 3929.08] lives.
[3929.18 → 3929.62] This act
[3929.62 → 3930.86] is definitional
[3930.86 → 3931.80] but we don't
[3931.80 → 3932.66] experience it
[3932.66 → 3933.32] in the act,
[3933.44 → 3934.06] we experience
[3934.06 → 3934.64] it in the
[3934.64 → 3935.16] living out.
[3936.10 → 3936.56] I'm going
[3936.56 → 3936.92] to illustrate
[3936.92 → 3938.32] this for
[3938.32 → 3938.54] you.
[3939.12 → 3939.90] And it's
[3939.90 → 3940.16] in this
[3940.16 → 3940.46] way that
[3940.46 → 3941.04] adoption
[3941.04 → 3942.08] becomes a
[3942.08 → 3943.08] really powerful
[3943.08 → 3944.54] metaphor for
[3944.54 → 3945.06] the gospel
[3945.06 → 3945.56] and its
[3945.56 → 3946.02] impact.
[3946.64 → 3947.34] If you've
[3947.34 → 3947.78] ever gone
[3947.78 → 3948.18] through
[3948.18 → 3948.78] adoption,
[3949.06 → 3949.52] you know
[3949.52 → 3950.58] this firsthand.
[3951.80 → 3951.96] Right?
[3952.52 → 3953.72] As you are
[3953.72 → 3954.14] going through
[3954.14 → 3954.64] the process
[3954.64 → 3955.26] of adoption,
[3955.56 → 3957.30] there's a
[3957.30 → 3958.20] moment where
[3958.20 → 3958.84] you're standing
[3958.84 → 3959.78] with a judge
[3959.78 → 3960.44] or a justice
[3960.44 → 3961.14] of the peace
[3961.14 → 3961.94] depending on
[3961.94 → 3962.30] what court
[3962.30 → 3962.82] system you
[3962.82 → 3963.18] are in
[3963.18 → 3964.00] and the
[3964.00 → 3965.12] judge declares
[3965.12 → 3966.86] this child
[3966.86 → 3967.46] is now
[3967.46 → 3967.88] yours.
[3969.40 → 3969.58] Right?
[3969.62 → 3970.34] This child
[3970.34 → 3971.30] has been
[3971.30 → 3972.42] moved from
[3972.42 → 3973.88] this place
[3973.88 → 3975.30] into this
[3975.30 → 3975.66] place.
[3975.76 → 3976.16] There's a
[3976.16 → 3977.64] legal exchange
[3977.64 → 3978.56] that is taking
[3978.56 → 3979.06] place.
[3979.58 → 3980.00] A new
[3980.00 → 3980.56] identity
[3980.56 → 3981.84] is granted.
[3981.84 → 3984.46] But then
[3984.46 → 3985.20] what has
[3985.20 → 3985.62] to happen?
[3987.54 → 3988.18] The kid
[3988.18 → 3988.90] has to go
[3988.90 → 3989.28] home with
[3989.28 → 3989.44] you.
[3990.38 → 3990.98] The kid
[3990.98 → 3991.66] has to learn
[3991.66 → 3992.00] what it
[3992.00 → 3992.54] means to
[3992.54 → 3993.24] be a
[3993.24 → 3993.60] dew inter
[3993.60 → 3994.62] and not
[3994.62 → 3995.18] whatever name
[3995.18 → 3995.74] they had
[3995.74 → 3996.32] previously.
[3996.84 → 3997.36] The kid
[3997.36 → 3997.88] has to learn
[3997.88 → 3998.08] what it
[3998.08 → 3998.30] means to
[3998.30 → 3998.66] be part
[3998.66 → 3999.00] of this
[3999.00 → 3999.44] family.
[3999.58 → 3999.82] And in
[3999.82 → 4000.42] this family
[4000.42 → 4000.84] we do
[4000.84 → 4001.42] these things
[4001.42 → 4002.20] this way.
[4002.28 → 4002.60] In this
[4002.60 → 4003.44] family we
[4003.44 → 4003.86] don't do
[4003.86 → 4004.44] these things
[4004.44 → 4005.24] that way.
[4006.78 → 4006.98] Right?
[4007.04 → 4007.96] That learning
[4007.96 → 4008.54] and that
[4008.54 → 4009.54] new reality,
[4009.72 → 4010.26] that going
[4010.26 → 4010.98] home with
[4010.98 → 4011.58] a family,
[4012.22 → 4012.62] that's
[4012.62 → 4013.40] sanctification.
[4014.10 → 4014.58] Positional
[4014.58 → 4015.78] sanctification.
[4017.04 → 4017.40] Right?
[4017.46 → 4017.94] The legal
[4017.94 → 4018.42] declaration
[4018.42 → 4019.22] has made
[4019.22 → 4019.74] you part
[4019.74 → 4020.04] of that
[4020.04 → 4020.60] new family
[4020.60 → 4021.18] and now
[4021.18 → 4021.48] you have
[4021.48 → 4022.10] to live
[4022.10 → 4022.90] and learn
[4022.90 → 4023.54] to live
[4023.54 → 4024.70] as a
[4024.70 → 4024.94] member
[4024.94 → 4025.44] of that
[4025.44 → 4025.86] family.
[4027.94 → 4028.56] That's
[4028.56 → 4029.28] positional
[4029.28 → 4030.40] sanctification.
[4030.62 → 4030.86] And that
[4030.86 → 4031.20] is a
[4031.20 → 4031.68] beautiful
[4031.68 → 4032.16] picture
[4032.16 → 4033.14] of what's
[4033.14 → 4033.50] happening
[4033.50 → 4034.30] in the
[4034.30 → 4034.68] gospel.
[4035.72 → 4036.40] A beautiful
[4036.40 → 4037.32] picture of
[4037.32 → 4038.00] the good
[4038.00 → 4038.46] news of
[4038.46 → 4039.08] Jesus Christ
[4039.08 → 4039.94] being applied
[4039.94 → 4040.98] to me
[4040.98 → 4041.28] and
[4041.28 → 4043.94] transforming
[4043.94 → 4045.74] my
[4045.74 → 4046.42] relationships
[4046.42 → 4047.44] in
[4047.44 → 4048.40] and to
[4048.40 → 4049.00] the world
[4049.00 → 4050.10] by transforming
[4050.10 → 4050.96] my relationship
[4050.96 → 4051.98] to God
[4051.98 → 4052.82] our Father
[4052.82 → 4053.80] and Creator.
[4058.00 → 4058.86] Next
[4058.86 → 4060.16] is the
[4060.16 → 4060.46] idea
[4060.46 → 4061.66] of progressive
[4061.66 → 4062.62] sanctification.
[4063.32 → 4063.42] Right?
[4063.46 → 4063.82] The idea
[4063.82 → 4064.88] that it
[4064.88 → 4065.16] is the
[4065.16 → 4065.54] work of
[4065.54 → 4065.92] the Holy
[4065.92 → 4066.38] Spirit
[4066.38 → 4067.04] to make
[4067.04 → 4067.56] us more
[4067.56 → 4067.90] like
[4067.90 → 4068.36] Jesus
[4068.36 → 4069.04] by
[4069.04 → 4069.84] progressively
[4069.84 → 4070.58] freeing
[4070.58 → 4070.88] us
[4070.88 → 4071.08] from
[4071.08 → 4071.26] the
[4071.26 → 4071.64] power
[4071.64 → 4072.12] of
[4072.12 → 4072.42] sin
[4072.42 → 4072.72] and
[4072.72 → 4072.94] by
[4072.94 → 4073.64] strengthening
[4073.64 → 4074.12] our
[4074.12 → 4074.74] disposition
[4074.74 → 4075.88] towards
[4075.88 → 4076.46] holiness.
[4077.46 → 4078.38] We read
[4078.38 → 4079.10] in Romans 6,
[4079.44 → 4079.78] so now
[4079.78 → 4080.72] offer yourselves
[4080.72 → 4081.52] as slaves
[4081.52 → 4082.42] to righteousness
[4082.42 → 4083.10] leading
[4083.10 → 4084.40] to holiness.
[4085.20 → 4085.54] And so this
[4085.54 → 4086.04] is the call
[4086.04 → 4086.68] to grow
[4086.68 → 4087.50] in the
[4087.50 → 4088.12] identity
[4088.12 → 4089.26] bestowed
[4089.26 → 4091.06] and so
[4091.06 → 4091.82] we progress
[4091.82 → 4093.18] in what it
[4093.18 → 4093.52] means to
[4093.52 → 4094.36] be consecrated
[4094.36 → 4095.14] to the
[4095.14 → 4095.36] Lord.
[4095.80 → 4096.16] And then
[4096.16 → 4096.52] finally
[4096.52 → 4097.56] we get
[4097.56 → 4097.98] this idea
[4097.98 → 4098.24] of
[4098.24 → 4099.34] perfected
[4099.34 → 4100.52] sanctification.
[4101.72 → 4102.22] Right?
[4102.26 → 4102.42] And the
[4102.42 → 4102.98] idea here
[4102.98 → 4104.06] is that
[4104.06 → 4105.40] to experience
[4105.40 → 4106.80] the full
[4106.80 → 4107.42] freedom
[4107.42 → 4108.62] from sin
[4108.62 → 4108.92] and
[4108.92 → 4110.10] uninterrupted
[4110.10 → 4110.56] communion
[4110.56 → 4111.36] with God
[4111.36 → 4112.24] that awaits
[4112.24 → 4112.72] us
[4112.72 → 4113.50] in the
[4113.50 → 4113.98] life to
[4113.98 → 4114.32] come.
[4114.32 → 4115.96] At this
[4115.96 → 4116.54] language
[4116.54 → 4117.46] this category
[4117.46 → 4118.04] of
[4118.04 → 4118.82] perfected
[4118.82 → 4119.74] sanctification
[4119.74 → 4121.18] is sometimes
[4121.18 → 4125.34] included
[4125.34 → 4125.82] in the
[4125.82 → 4126.12] broader
[4126.12 → 4126.82] category
[4126.82 → 4127.16] of
[4127.16 → 4128.12] glorification
[4128.12 → 4129.46] which
[4129.46 → 4129.94] includes
[4129.94 → 4130.44] more than
[4130.44 → 4131.14] sanctification
[4131.14 → 4131.58] but also
[4131.58 → 4132.12] resurrection
[4132.12 → 4132.56] and the
[4132.56 → 4132.92] restoration
[4132.92 → 4133.54] of all
[4133.54 → 4133.94] things
[4133.94 → 4134.56] at the
[4134.56 → 4134.88] end of
[4134.88 → 4135.28] time
[4135.28 → 4135.98] the end
[4135.98 → 4136.52] of history.
[4137.96 → 4138.88] Now in
[4138.88 → 4139.28] each of
[4139.28 → 4140.12] these places
[4140.12 → 4140.88] positional
[4140.88 → 4141.44] and progressive
[4141.44 → 4142.52] and perfected
[4142.52 → 4143.26] there's a
[4143.26 → 4143.72] sense
[4143.72 → 4144.94] in which
[4144.94 → 4146.26] we can
[4146.26 → 4146.74] make
[4146.74 → 4149.36] sense
[4149.36 → 4150.20] of this
[4150.20 → 4151.20] theological
[4151.20 → 4151.82] truth
[4151.82 → 4153.02] and reality
[4153.02 → 4154.56] with another
[4154.56 → 4155.10] theological
[4155.10 → 4155.54] term
[4155.54 → 4155.88] and I
[4155.88 → 4156.40] understand
[4156.40 → 4156.74] that we're
[4156.74 → 4157.18] getting lots
[4157.18 → 4157.48] of terms
[4157.48 → 4157.90] this morning
[4157.90 → 4159.12] but it's
[4159.12 → 4159.70] the idea
[4159.70 → 4160.04] of
[4160.04 → 4160.90] inaugurated
[4160.90 → 4161.78] eschatology
[4161.78 → 4162.74] and so
[4162.74 → 4163.02] that is
[4163.02 → 4163.48] that Jesus
[4163.48 → 4164.14] in his
[4164.14 → 4164.46] life,
[4164.58 → 4164.78] death,
[4164.98 → 4165.38] resurrection
[4165.38 → 4166.64] and exaltation
[4166.64 → 4168.02] started,
[4168.34 → 4168.86] brought in,
[4169.02 → 4169.74] ushered in
[4169.74 → 4170.38] the kingdom
[4170.38 → 4171.22] of God
[4171.22 → 4171.84] and that has
[4171.84 → 4172.74] begun
[4172.74 → 4173.54] in his
[4173.54 → 4174.22] life and
[4174.22 → 4174.48] death
[4174.48 → 4175.12] that has
[4175.12 → 4175.90] broken into
[4175.90 → 4176.36] the world
[4176.36 → 4176.74] through the
[4176.74 → 4177.24] church at
[4177.24 → 4177.80] Pentecost
[4177.80 → 4178.26] and the work
[4178.26 → 4178.62] of the Holy
[4178.62 → 4178.96] Spirit
[4178.96 → 4179.54] that the
[4179.54 → 4180.12] church now
[4180.12 → 4181.08] lives out
[4181.08 → 4182.04] this truth
[4182.04 → 4182.68] and this way
[4182.68 → 4183.22] of being
[4183.22 → 4183.74] in relation
[4183.74 → 4184.52] to the world
[4184.52 → 4185.04] and that we
[4185.04 → 4185.86] wait for the
[4185.86 → 4186.80] day of its
[4186.80 → 4187.56] fullness
[4187.56 → 4188.40] when Christ
[4188.40 → 4188.90] returns.
[4190.48 → 4191.34] You hear in
[4191.34 → 4192.58] that each
[4192.58 → 4193.00] one of these
[4193.00 → 4194.46] aspects of
[4194.46 → 4195.12] sanctification.
[4195.12 → 4195.18] sanctification.
[4197.68 → 4197.94] Now,
[4198.66 → 4200.50] here's why
[4200.50 → 4201.14] this matters
[4201.14 → 4202.12] and why we
[4202.12 → 4202.76] belaboured this
[4202.76 → 4203.64] doctrinal point
[4203.64 → 4205.02] and so here's
[4205.02 → 4205.56] the practical
[4205.56 → 4206.04] payoff.
[4206.18 → 4206.60] So thank you
[4206.60 → 4207.08] for journeying
[4207.08 → 4207.50] with me.
[4207.92 → 4208.68] You can applaud
[4208.68 → 4209.14] yourself,
[4209.26 → 4209.82] pat yourself on
[4209.82 → 4210.32] the back for
[4210.32 → 4210.70] doing good
[4210.70 → 4211.16] work there
[4211.16 → 4213.12] because besides
[4213.12 → 4213.74] the sheer
[4213.74 → 4214.88] beauty of
[4214.88 → 4215.50] the adoption
[4215.50 → 4216.22] image for
[4216.22 → 4216.76] understanding
[4216.76 → 4217.52] sanctification
[4217.52 → 4218.64] and that part
[4218.64 → 4219.10] makes my
[4219.10 → 4219.68] heart sing
[4219.68 → 4221.20] but also
[4221.20 → 4221.84] here's why
[4221.84 → 4222.26] it matters.
[4222.26 → 4224.62] personal holiness
[4224.62 → 4226.58] is at stake
[4226.58 → 4227.78] in how we
[4227.78 → 4228.38] talk about
[4228.38 → 4229.24] personal holiness.
[4231.12 → 4231.46] Okay, so
[4231.46 → 4231.86] here's what I
[4231.86 → 4232.32] mean by that.
[4232.82 → 4234.64] If we focus
[4234.64 → 4236.72] on positional
[4236.72 → 4237.54] sanctification
[4237.54 → 4238.04] that is our
[4238.04 → 4238.90] new reality
[4238.90 → 4240.28] without an
[4240.28 → 4241.06] understanding of
[4241.06 → 4241.48] progressive
[4241.48 → 4242.28] sanctification
[4242.28 → 4243.46] we end up
[4243.46 → 4244.14] with what some
[4244.14 → 4244.48] people have
[4244.48 → 4245.00] called cheap
[4245.00 → 4245.42] grace.
[4246.34 → 4247.22] The idea that
[4247.22 → 4247.64] says I'm
[4247.64 → 4248.52] already accepted
[4248.52 → 4249.36] therefore I
[4249.36 → 4250.02] don't have to
[4250.02 → 4250.36] obey.
[4250.36 → 4252.32] that's cheap
[4252.32 → 4252.70] grace.
[4254.10 → 4254.82] But if we
[4254.82 → 4255.44] focus on
[4255.44 → 4256.04] progressive
[4256.04 → 4256.80] without
[4256.80 → 4257.94] propositional
[4257.94 → 4258.86] right, without
[4258.86 → 4259.96] this definitional
[4259.96 → 4261.06] change you end
[4261.06 → 4261.42] up in this
[4261.42 → 4261.82] place of
[4261.82 → 4262.40] legalism
[4262.40 → 4263.66] that says
[4263.66 → 4264.30] you have to
[4264.30 → 4264.84] do all of
[4264.84 → 4265.46] these things
[4265.46 → 4266.84] or live in
[4266.84 → 4267.68] fear of
[4267.68 → 4268.14] not doing
[4268.14 → 4269.02] them because
[4269.02 → 4269.34] it's not
[4269.34 → 4269.88] based on
[4269.88 → 4270.32] this new
[4270.32 → 4270.80] identity
[4270.80 → 4271.78] reality for
[4271.78 → 4272.00] you.
[4273.34 → 4273.60] And then
[4273.60 → 4274.38] likewise if
[4274.38 → 4274.68] you have
[4274.68 → 4275.24] progressive
[4275.24 → 4275.90] without
[4275.90 → 4276.78] perfected
[4276.78 → 4277.76] we end
[4277.76 → 4278.84] up with
[4278.84 → 4279.66] hopelessness.
[4280.36 → 4281.76] because we
[4281.76 → 4282.06] go what's
[4282.06 → 4282.44] the point
[4282.44 → 4282.68] of it
[4282.68 → 4283.84] all if
[4283.84 → 4284.12] I'm never
[4284.12 → 4284.38] going to
[4284.38 → 4284.80] get there.
[4285.82 → 4286.44] But you
[4286.44 → 4287.12] will be
[4287.12 → 4287.74] ushered
[4287.74 → 4288.72] into this
[4288.72 → 4289.58] full
[4289.58 → 4290.48] transformation
[4290.48 → 4291.26] at the
[4291.26 → 4291.74] return of
[4291.74 → 4291.96] Jesus
[4291.96 → 4292.44] Christ.
[4293.40 → 4294.28] I must
[4294.28 → 4294.74] obey
[4294.74 → 4295.32] because if
[4295.32 → 4295.92] I fail
[4295.92 → 4296.56] we fear
[4296.56 → 4297.00] I won't
[4297.00 → 4297.64] be accepted.
[4299.18 → 4299.68] Instead
[4299.68 → 4300.32] when we
[4300.32 → 4301.04] understand this
[4301.04 → 4301.70] properly
[4301.70 → 4302.20] when we
[4302.20 → 4302.68] pull all
[4302.68 → 4303.04] of these
[4303.04 → 4303.36] three
[4303.36 → 4304.14] together
[4304.14 → 4304.60] what we
[4304.60 → 4305.18] see is
[4305.18 → 4305.86] that I'm
[4305.86 → 4306.46] accepted
[4306.46 → 4307.78] by Jesus
[4307.78 → 4308.62] therefore
[4308.62 → 4310.00] I get
[4310.00 → 4310.98] to obey
[4310.98 → 4311.94] Jesus.
[4313.10 → 4313.72] In fact
[4313.72 → 4314.36] what Paul
[4314.36 → 4315.22] is pointing
[4315.22 → 4315.84] out here
[4315.84 → 4316.44] is that
[4316.44 → 4317.80] disobedience
[4317.80 → 4319.08] demeans
[4319.08 → 4320.02] your identity.
[4321.86 → 4322.54] Minimizing
[4322.54 → 4323.44] makes
[4323.44 → 4324.30] excuses
[4324.30 → 4326.18] that rejects
[4326.18 → 4326.78] the transformation
[4326.78 → 4327.42] you've been
[4327.42 → 4327.70] given.
[4328.36 → 4328.46] Right?
[4328.88 → 4329.58] Let's use
[4329.58 → 4329.94] the metaphor
[4329.94 → 4330.24] again.
[4330.56 → 4331.28] Not being
[4331.28 → 4331.92] all in
[4331.92 → 4332.62] on this
[4332.62 → 4333.82] is like
[4333.82 → 4334.66] asking for
[4334.66 → 4335.54] the orphanage
[4335.54 → 4335.96] when you're
[4335.96 → 4336.36] sitting
[4336.36 → 4336.92] at your
[4336.92 → 4337.10] new
[4337.10 → 4337.50] family's
[4337.50 → 4337.82] table
[4337.82 → 4339.66] saying
[4339.66 → 4339.84] I'd
[4339.84 → 4340.00] rather
[4340.00 → 4340.20] have
[4340.20 → 4340.46] that.
[4342.86 → 4343.46] But
[4343.46 → 4343.64] you've
[4343.64 → 4343.98] got a
[4343.98 → 4344.94] God-given
[4344.94 → 4346.16] blood-bought
[4346.16 → 4346.78] family
[4346.78 → 4347.72] that wants
[4347.72 → 4348.04] to say
[4348.04 → 4348.88] this is
[4348.88 → 4349.44] who you
[4349.44 → 4349.82] are.
[4350.76 → 4351.52] And this
[4351.52 → 4352.00] holiness
[4352.00 → 4352.56] language
[4352.56 → 4353.22] for Paul
[4353.22 → 4354.02] is repeated
[4354.02 → 4354.88] in verse
[4354.88 → 4355.88] 4 and
[4355.88 → 4356.56] 7 and
[4356.56 → 4356.84] it is
[4356.84 → 4357.30] eventually
[4357.30 → 4357.90] grounded
[4357.90 → 4358.74] in the
[4358.74 → 4359.28] person and
[4359.28 → 4359.62] work of
[4359.62 → 4359.94] the Holy
[4359.94 → 4360.36] Spirit
[4360.36 → 4361.20] in verse
[4361.20 → 4361.50] 8.
[4362.82 → 4363.16] For God
[4363.16 → 4363.44] did not
[4363.44 → 4363.88] call us
[4363.88 → 4364.16] to be
[4364.16 → 4364.62] impure
[4364.62 → 4364.96] but to
[4364.96 → 4365.28] live a
[4365.28 → 4365.50] holy
[4365.50 → 4365.82] life.
[4365.98 → 4366.18] Therefore
[4366.18 → 4366.80] anyone who
[4366.80 → 4367.34] rejects
[4367.34 → 4367.52] this
[4367.52 → 4368.02] instruction
[4368.02 → 4368.88] does not
[4368.88 → 4369.30] reject a
[4369.30 → 4369.90] human being
[4369.90 → 4370.68] but God
[4370.68 → 4371.30] the very
[4371.30 → 4372.00] God who
[4372.00 → 4372.74] gives you
[4372.74 → 4373.24] his
[4373.24 → 4374.14] Holy
[4374.14 → 4375.32] Spirit.
[4377.14 → 4377.28] The
[4377.28 → 4377.88] spiritual
[4377.88 → 4378.42] gift
[4378.42 → 4378.92] most
[4378.92 → 4379.48] common
[4379.48 → 4380.32] to all
[4380.32 → 4380.78] Christian
[4380.78 → 4381.38] that is
[4381.38 → 4381.98] actually
[4381.98 → 4382.86] what defines
[4382.86 → 4383.50] being a
[4383.50 → 4383.88] Christian
[4383.88 → 4385.04] is the
[4385.04 → 4385.26] Holy
[4385.26 → 4385.82] Spirit
[4385.82 → 4386.92] and the
[4386.92 → 4387.14] gift
[4387.14 → 4387.80] towards
[4387.80 → 4388.32] obedience
[4388.32 → 4389.24] and
[4389.24 → 4389.68] transformation.
[4391.76 → 4392.68] All right.
[4392.68 → 4394.78] let's
[4394.78 → 4396.08] end this
[4396.08 → 4396.48] morning
[4396.48 → 4398.58] by thinking
[4398.58 → 4399.42] about the
[4399.42 → 4400.08] practical
[4400.08 → 4401.24] implications
[4401.24 → 4401.78] of this.
[4403.34 → 4403.54] And so
[4403.54 → 4403.92] remember
[4403.92 → 4405.04] in justification
[4405.04 → 4406.22] and sanctification
[4406.22 → 4407.24] you are
[4407.24 → 4407.96] transformed.
[4408.78 → 4409.26] In a
[4409.26 → 4410.04] positional
[4410.04 → 4410.80] understanding
[4410.80 → 4411.54] of sanctification
[4411.54 → 4412.12] you are
[4412.12 → 4412.64] given a
[4412.64 → 4413.20] new way
[4413.20 → 4413.80] of relating
[4413.80 → 4414.18] to the
[4414.18 → 4414.72] world by
[4414.72 → 4415.40] belonging to
[4415.40 → 4415.66] a new
[4415.66 → 4416.10] family.
[4416.76 → 4417.20] And in
[4417.20 → 4417.60] progressive
[4417.60 → 4418.26] sanctification
[4418.26 → 4419.02] you and
[4419.02 → 4419.34] the Holy
[4419.34 → 4419.76] Spirit
[4419.76 → 4420.36] cooperate
[4420.36 → 4421.04] together
[4421.04 → 4421.48] that you
[4421.48 → 4421.70] might
[4421.70 → 4422.10] grow
[4422.10 → 4422.98] in living
[4422.98 → 4423.54] as one
[4423.54 → 4424.10] who belongs
[4424.10 → 4424.64] to God
[4424.64 → 4425.20] and in
[4425.20 → 4425.78] perfected
[4425.78 → 4426.34] sanctification
[4426.34 → 4427.00] you are
[4427.00 → 4427.52] shown the
[4427.52 → 4428.02] purpose of
[4428.02 → 4428.32] it all
[4428.32 → 4429.26] the tells
[4429.26 → 4430.00] towards which
[4430.00 → 4430.66] we are all
[4430.66 → 4431.30] going
[4431.30 → 4432.52] blamelessness
[4432.52 → 4432.84] at the
[4432.84 → 4433.38] resurrection
[4433.38 → 4434.72] and glorification
[4434.72 → 4435.38] to be with
[4435.38 → 4435.70] God
[4435.70 → 4436.44] forever.
[4437.50 → 4438.00] And so
[4438.00 → 4438.78] for right
[4438.78 → 4439.26] now
[4439.26 → 4441.00] what does
[4441.00 → 4441.34] that look
[4441.34 → 4441.68] like?
[4442.18 → 4442.68] For right
[4442.68 → 4443.10] now
[4443.10 → 4443.70] what does
[4443.70 → 4444.16] God tell
[4444.16 → 4444.46] us?
[4445.48 → 4445.78] Well one
[4445.78 → 4445.98] of the
[4445.98 → 4446.56] places Paul
[4446.56 → 4446.86] goes
[4446.86 → 4447.44] immediately
[4447.44 → 4449.64] is to
[4449.64 → 4450.08] our
[4450.08 → 4451.08] sexual
[4451.08 → 4452.14] lives.
[4453.52 → 4454.38] In a
[4454.38 → 4454.72] world
[4454.72 → 4455.52] saturated
[4455.52 → 4456.36] with sex
[4456.36 → 4457.10] and with
[4457.10 → 4457.38] taking
[4457.38 → 4457.82] advantage
[4457.82 → 4458.38] of people
[4458.38 → 4460.08] you are
[4460.08 → 4460.92] consecrated
[4460.92 → 4461.92] for something
[4461.92 → 4462.52] different.
[4464.06 → 4464.46] And not
[4464.46 → 4465.30] only do
[4465.30 → 4466.02] you start
[4466.02 → 4466.58] with a
[4466.58 → 4466.88] different
[4466.88 → 4467.52] relationship
[4467.52 → 4468.26] to sex
[4468.26 → 4468.64] and to
[4468.64 → 4469.18] sexuality
[4469.18 → 4470.40] and through
[4470.40 → 4470.88] that to
[4470.88 → 4471.68] all people
[4471.68 → 4473.10] but by
[4473.10 → 4473.42] the Holy
[4473.42 → 4473.76] Spirit
[4473.76 → 4474.06] you're
[4474.06 → 4474.68] actually
[4474.68 → 4475.10] made
[4475.10 → 4475.66] able
[4475.66 → 4476.54] to live
[4476.54 → 4476.88] that
[4476.88 → 4477.42] out.
[4477.44 → 4483.16] in a
[4483.16 → 4483.68] culture
[4483.68 → 4484.60] and a
[4484.60 → 4485.06] time
[4485.06 → 4485.88] and place
[4485.88 → 4486.22] that
[4486.22 → 4487.18] celebrates
[4487.18 → 4488.28] sexual
[4488.28 → 4489.28] hedonism
[4489.28 → 4490.72] we get
[4490.72 → 4491.40] to celebrate
[4491.40 → 4492.14] holiness
[4492.14 → 4493.00] to God.
[4494.00 → 4495.04] We get
[4495.04 → 4495.62] to celebrate
[4495.62 → 4496.44] being like
[4496.44 → 4497.12] God.
[4497.24 → 4497.52] We get
[4497.52 → 4498.04] to celebrate
[4498.04 → 4498.84] being transformed
[4498.84 → 4499.74] into the
[4499.74 → 4500.28] image of
[4500.28 → 4501.04] Jesus Christ
[4501.04 → 4501.86] which is a
[4501.86 → 4502.46] celebration
[4502.46 → 4503.34] of what
[4503.34 → 4503.90] humanity
[4503.90 → 4504.82] was always
[4504.82 → 4505.38] intended
[4505.38 → 4505.92] to be
[4505.92 → 4506.32] like.
[4506.32 → 4506.42] joy.
[4507.42 → 4508.02] This
[4508.02 → 4509.02] idea
[4509.02 → 4509.80] of life
[4509.80 → 4510.72] is actually
[4510.72 → 4511.48] true
[4511.48 → 4512.18] and greater
[4512.18 → 4512.86] joy.
[4513.00 → 4513.80] This idea
[4513.80 → 4514.36] about whom
[4514.36 → 4515.06] you are
[4515.06 → 4515.96] is actually
[4515.96 → 4516.44] true
[4516.44 → 4517.06] and greater
[4517.06 → 4517.62] good.
[4518.46 → 4519.08] This way
[4519.08 → 4519.62] of being
[4519.62 → 4520.04] in the
[4520.04 → 4520.34] world
[4520.34 → 4520.92] is so
[4520.92 → 4521.24] much
[4521.24 → 4521.78] more
[4521.78 → 4522.22] fulfilling
[4522.22 → 4522.86] because
[4522.86 → 4523.40] anything
[4523.40 → 4523.84] else
[4523.84 → 4524.34] in the
[4524.34 → 4524.56] end
[4524.56 → 4525.06] proves
[4525.06 → 4525.60] to be
[4525.60 → 4526.22] vapid
[4526.22 → 4526.60] and
[4526.60 → 4526.98] empty.
[4526.98 → 4527.22] It
[4527.22 → 4527.58] proves
[4527.58 → 4528.02] to be
[4528.02 → 4528.88] fleeting
[4528.88 → 4529.30] and
[4529.30 → 4529.66] anemic.
[4529.84 → 4529.92] It
[4529.92 → 4530.20] proves
[4530.20 → 4530.58] to be
[4530.58 → 4531.04] like the
[4531.04 → 4531.46] teacher
[4531.46 → 4531.66] in
[4531.66 → 4532.34] Ecclesiastes
[4532.34 → 4533.38] a chasing
[4533.38 → 4534.04] after the
[4534.04 → 4534.38] wind.
[4535.38 → 4535.94] It's
[4535.94 → 4536.32] meaningless.
[4537.96 → 4538.54] It's
[4538.54 → 4539.16] only in
[4539.16 → 4539.88] relationship
[4539.88 → 4540.62] to God
[4540.62 → 4541.02] and only
[4541.02 → 4541.22] in
[4541.22 → 4542.08] understanding
[4542.08 → 4542.88] what he
[4542.88 → 4543.38] has done
[4543.38 → 4543.88] for us
[4543.88 → 4544.22] and who
[4544.22 → 4544.70] he has
[4544.70 → 4545.12] made us
[4545.12 → 4545.56] to be
[4545.56 → 4546.16] that we
[4546.16 → 4546.64] begin
[4546.64 → 4547.14] to make
[4547.14 → 4547.54] sense
[4547.54 → 4547.96] not only
[4547.96 → 4548.34] of this
[4548.34 → 4548.62] life
[4548.62 → 4549.20] but what
[4549.20 → 4549.80] it actually
[4549.80 → 4550.30] means
[4550.30 → 4550.86] to be
[4550.86 → 4551.66] human.
[4553.54 → 4553.96] You
[4553.96 → 4554.94] are set
[4554.94 → 4555.84] apart.
[4556.92 → 4557.08] You
[4557.08 → 4557.94] are called
[4557.94 → 4558.88] and enabled
[4558.88 → 4559.70] to live
[4559.70 → 4560.42] that way
[4560.42 → 4562.08] and God
[4562.08 → 4562.98] will carry
[4562.98 → 4563.94] you to
[4563.94 → 4564.40] the end
[4564.40 → 4564.78] of that
[4564.78 → 4565.10] to the
[4565.10 → 4565.96] completeness
[4565.96 → 4566.82] of your
[4566.82 → 4567.32] holiness.
[4569.00 → 4569.72] May I
[4569.72 → 4570.20] just encourage
[4570.20 → 4570.48] you
[4570.48 → 4573.02] if more
[4573.02 → 4573.36] of us
[4573.36 → 4573.70] started
[4573.70 → 4574.26] living like
[4574.26 → 4574.62] that was
[4574.62 → 4574.98] true
[4574.98 → 4577.30] those
[4577.30 → 4577.82] questions
[4577.82 → 4578.64] and complaints
[4578.64 → 4579.86] and concerns
[4579.86 → 4580.20] that we
[4580.20 → 4580.54] talked about
[4580.54 → 4580.72] at the
[4580.72 → 4580.96] beginning
[4580.96 → 4582.30] what
[4582.30 → 4582.68] difference
[4582.68 → 4583.18] does this
[4583.18 → 4583.48] make
[4583.48 → 4585.04] would be
[4585.04 → 4585.80] immediately
[4585.80 → 4587.04] destroyed.
[4588.88 → 4592.26] increasingly
[4592.26 → 4593.86] it is
[4593.86 → 4594.46] simultaneously
[4594.46 → 4595.22] becoming
[4595.22 → 4596.34] harder
[4596.34 → 4597.48] to be
[4597.48 → 4597.94] Christian
[4597.94 → 4599.42] in the
[4599.42 → 4599.62] world
[4599.62 → 4600.04] today
[4600.04 → 4601.86] but
[4601.86 → 4602.50] rather than
[4602.50 → 4603.04] lamenting
[4603.04 → 4603.48] that we
[4603.48 → 4603.82] have an
[4603.82 → 4604.34] opportunity
[4604.34 → 4605.40] to say
[4605.40 → 4605.66] you know
[4605.66 → 4606.00] what that
[4606.00 → 4606.40] does
[4606.40 → 4607.14] it makes
[4607.14 → 4608.08] it is easier
[4608.08 → 4609.36] to stand
[4609.36 → 4610.18] out
[4610.18 → 4611.82] to stand
[4611.82 → 4612.48] apart
[4612.48 → 4613.96] to look
[4613.96 → 4614.80] like
[4614.80 → 4615.56] the image
[4615.56 → 4616.08] of Jesus
[4616.08 → 4616.54] Christ
[4616.54 → 4616.96] in the
[4616.96 → 4617.16] world
[4617.16 → 4617.54] today
[4617.54 → 4618.12] and may
[4618.12 → 4618.52] I just
[4618.52 → 4618.74] say
[4618.74 → 4619.38] that
[4619.38 → 4620.46] is what
[4620.46 → 4620.62] our
[4620.62 → 4620.90] hurting
[4620.90 → 4621.20] world
[4621.20 → 4621.62] needs
[4621.62 → 4623.22] more
[4623.22 → 4623.76] Christians
[4623.76 → 4624.10] who
[4624.10 → 4624.42] look
[4624.42 → 4625.22] like
[4625.22 → 4626.12] Jesus
[4626.12 → 4626.88] amen
[4626.88 → 4628.16] let's
[4628.16 → 4628.30] pray
[4628.30 → 4628.68] together
[4628.68 → 4631.82] dear
[4631.82 → 4632.20] Jesus
[4632.20 → 4633.64] transform
[4633.64 → 4634.66] us
[4634.66 → 4635.24] transform
[4635.24 → 4635.68] our
[4635.68 → 4636.12] lives
[4636.12 → 4637.02] in line
[4637.02 → 4637.46] with
[4637.46 → 4637.72] the
[4637.72 → 4638.22] calling
[4638.22 → 4638.50] that
[4638.50 → 4638.68] you
[4638.68 → 4638.92] have
[4638.92 → 4639.18] given
[4639.18 → 4639.42] us
[4639.42 → 4640.16] transform
[4640.16 → 4640.48] our
[4640.48 → 4640.80] lives
[4640.80 → 4641.82] working
[4641.82 → 4642.20] out
[4642.20 → 4642.56] of
[4642.56 → 4642.82] our
[4642.82 → 4643.20] new
[4643.20 → 4643.94] identities
[4643.94 → 4644.78] in
[4644.78 → 4645.00] you
[4645.00 → 4645.28] our
[4645.28 → 4645.64] new
[4645.64 → 4646.48] relationships
[4646.48 → 4647.28] to
[4647.28 → 4647.50] you
[4647.50 → 4647.90] this
[4647.90 → 4648.22] is
[4648.22 → 4648.44] what
[4648.44 → 4648.58] it
[4648.58 → 4648.96] means
[4648.96 → 4649.22] to
[4649.22 → 4649.64] be
[4649.64 → 4650.78] lavishly
[4650.78 → 4651.20] loved
[4651.20 → 4651.64] children
[4651.64 → 4652.06] of the
[4652.06 → 4652.36] father
[4652.36 → 4652.64] this
[4652.64 → 4652.78] is
[4652.78 → 4652.92] what
[4652.92 → 4653.04] it
[4653.04 → 4653.34] means
[4653.34 → 4653.54] to
[4653.54 → 4653.86] be
[4653.86 → 4654.50] your

[4655.78 → 4656.14] Lord
[4656.14 → 4656.52] Jesus
[4656.52 → 4656.92] Christ
[4656.92 → 4657.56] this
[4657.56 → 4657.76] is
[4657.76 → 4657.92] what
[4657.92 → 4658.06] it
[4658.06 → 4658.34] means
[4658.34 → 4658.56] to
[4658.56 → 4658.82] be
[4658.82 → 4659.86] consecrated
[4659.86 → 4660.24] for
[4660.24 → 4660.26] for
[4660.26 → 4660.94] divine
[4660.94 → 4661.98] purpose
[4661.98 → 4662.32] and
[4662.32 → 4662.70] so
[4662.70 → 4663.08] Lord
[4663.08 → 4663.46] God
[4663.46 → 4664.24] send
[4664.24 → 4664.66] us
[4664.66 → 4665.02] out
[4665.02 → 4665.46] now
[4665.46 → 4665.68] in
[4665.68 → 4665.82] the
[4665.82 → 4666.46] power
[4666.46 → 4667.12] of
[4667.12 → 4667.30] the
[4667.30 → 4667.56] Holy
[4667.56 → 4667.98] Spirit
[4667.98 → 4669.90] send
[4669.90 → 4670.12] us
[4670.12 → 4670.32] out
[4670.32 → 4670.66] now
[4670.66 → 4671.66] that
[4671.66 → 4671.94] even
[4671.94 → 4672.30] as
[4672.30 → 4672.52] we
[4672.52 → 4672.98] face
[4672.98 → 4673.88] trials
[4673.88 → 4674.72] tribulations
[4674.72 → 4675.14] even
[4675.14 → 4675.38] as
[4675.38 → 4675.56] we
[4675.56 → 4675.94] face
[4675.94 → 4677.02] questions
[4677.02 → 4677.38] and
[4677.38 → 4677.88] opposition
[4677.88 → 4678.22] and
[4678.22 → 4678.68] wondering
[4678.68 → 4679.42] for
[4679.42 → 4679.66] our
[4679.66 → 4680.00] faith
[4680.00 → 4681.40] that
[4681.40 → 4681.74] people
[4681.74 → 4682.24] looking
[4682.24 → 4682.58] at
[4682.58 → 4682.90] our
[4682.90 → 4683.38] lives
[4683.38 → 4683.56] would
[4683.56 → 4683.72] be
[4683.72 → 4684.40] amazed
[4684.40 → 4685.26] at
[4685.26 → 4685.46] what
[4685.46 → 4685.94] you
[4685.94 → 4686.88] are
[4686.88 → 4687.22] doing
[4687.22 → 4688.30] in
[4688.30 → 4688.54] Jesus
[4688.54 → 4688.88] name
[4688.88 → 4689.08] we
[4689.08 → 4689.36] pray
[4689.36 → 4690.50] amen
[4717.22 → 4719.22] purify
[4719.22 → 4721.50] my
[4721.50 → 4723.02] heart
[4723.02 → 4723.22] let
[4723.90 → 4724.34] me
[4724.34 → 4724.72] be
[4724.72 → 4725.54] as
[4725.54 → 4727.44] gold
[4727.44 → 4728.18] and
[4728.18 → 4729.22] precious
[4729.22 → 4730.92] silver
[4730.92 → 4732.66] purify
[4732.66 → 4734.22] my
[4734.22 → 4735.58] heart
[4735.58 → 4736.52] let
[4736.52 → 4736.94] me
[4736.94 → 4737.38] be
