[778.30 → 779.60] Good morning.
[780.94 → 783.00] Welcome to church.
[783.54 → 788.10] A special welcome if you are a guest here or if you are joining us online.
[788.64 → 791.68] We appreciate you gathering with us for worship.
[791.82 → 792.54] My name is Chris.
[792.54 → 795.00] I'm one of the pastors here at Emanuel.
[795.32 → 801.52] And it's my privilege to lead in our worship this morning with a few others here as well.
[802.68 → 806.36] As we gather for worship in community, we've got a couple announcements.
[806.64 → 812.26] And so I'm going to have Mike make his way to the front as he has an announcement from the deacons.
[813.00 → 818.54] And then I also just want to remind you or inform you that tonight at 7 p.m.,
[818.54 → 824.86] HCBC and the Canons of Dort reading group are happening here.
[825.32 → 829.62] So we meet for the Canons of Dort in the multipurpose room, HCBC.
[829.86 → 831.94] That's from grades 9 through 12.
[832.12 → 834.96] You'll meet with your leaders in different rooms as well.
[835.08 → 838.54] And so we'd love to see you out for that evening tonight.
[839.20 → 842.72] It's the second gathering this year for those different groups.
[843.18 → 843.34] Mike?
[843.34 → 849.00] Yeah, and again, we're running a bit of a Christmas hamper campaign like we have in many years past.
[849.16 → 853.28] And we're partnering with H.D. Stafford Middle School and Big Brothers Big Sisters of Langley.
[853.40 → 857.94] So we still need quite a few people to sign up and to be part of that.
[858.00 → 862.38] So you would help provide a hamper for a family in need in Langley.
[862.88 → 867.68] And they usually, the organization usually gives us a wish list and more details to follow.
[867.68 → 871.26] But we just need some people to sign up to help provide that in December.
[871.62 → 875.98] So there's a sign-up at the information booth, or you can talk to myself or Pearl DeShawn.
[876.40 → 882.02] And we're still looking for about 10 more people to sign up, which would be really great to help out those organizations.
[882.28 → 884.14] So talk with us after the service.
[886.08 → 886.82] Thanks, Mike.
[886.82 → 898.16] As well, just a note on Wednesday of this week at 7 p.m., the Through the Bible group is gathering again.
[898.44 → 905.84] And this Wednesday at 7, we'll be discussing the riveting book of the Bible known as Leviticus.
[906.82 → 911.92] And so if you're looking for a time to jump into the reading program, this is a good one.
[912.24 → 916.06] It will be a fun discussion, I am sure, on Wednesday night at 7 p.m.
[916.06 → 919.22] And then lastly, you may have seen it out in the foyer.
[919.92 → 923.32] The sign-up for the women's Christmas event is there.
[923.64 → 929.56] And you can sign up to decorate a table or to help clean up and to participate in that.
[929.92 → 932.92] I trust that there will be someone from the women's fellowship group.
[933.02 → 937.98] They'll gather at the back there and answer any questions you have following our service together.
[938.76 → 940.24] I think that's it for announcements.
[940.84 → 943.98] So I'm going to invite you, as you're able and where you are, to stand.
[943.98 → 946.98] That we can be welcomed into God's presence together.
[950.92 → 958.22] Worship starts with God proclaiming his presence, his nearness, his greeting over us.
[958.34 → 965.04] And then we respond to that by extending it to those around us as God ushers us into worship.
[965.24 → 970.62] And so after I give you God's greeting, I invite you to turn to those around you and welcome them in worship this morning.
[970.76 → 972.60] Receive the greeting of our good God.
[972.60 → 981.88] Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son and our Saviour,
[982.56 → 984.74] through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[985.74 → 985.98] Amen.
[1002.60 → 1029.14] Great and marvellous are your deeds, Lord God Almighty.
[1029.14 → 1032.34] Just and true are your ways, King of the ages.
[1032.94 → 1035.98] Who will not fear you, O Lord, and bring glory to your name?
[1036.42 → 1037.78] For you alone are holy.
[1038.14 → 1040.96] All nations will come and worship you, the living God.
[1040.96 → 1066.42] Come, people of the risen King, who delight to bring in praise.
[1066.42 → 1074.82] Come, all in tune your hearts to sing through the morning star of grace.
[1075.32 → 1083.30] From the shifting shadows of the earth, we will lift our eyes to him.
[1083.30 → 1090.38] Where steady arms of mercy reach to gather children.
[1090.38 → 1099.38] Rejoice, rejoice, let every tongue rejoice.

[1123.74 → 1132.08] Come those who tell of battle's won, and those struggling in the night.
[1132.08 → 1140.46] For his perfect love will never change, and his mercies never cease.
[1140.46 → 1148.80] But follow us through all our days with a certain hope of peace.
[1148.80 → 1157.26] Rejoice, rejoice, let every tongue rejoice.

[1560.02 → 1561.50] may not perish, but have eternal life.
[1561.56 → 1562.06] Indeed, God did not send the Son into the world
[1562.06 → 1562.92] to condemn the world,
[1562.92 → 1563.96] but in order that the world might be saved through Him.
[1563.96 → 1565.96] Amen.
[1593.96 → 1602.54] And yet for me, your love is still the same.
[1604.50 → 1613.96] Lord, I bend my knee, it is awe and fear of me.
[1613.96 → 1623.34] My head bowed down in reverence to your name.
[1623.96 → 1634.26] I lift your name, your holy name.
[1634.70 → 1642.96] The home of God, and all here.
[1642.96 → 1652.96] The great I am, there is a land.
[1653.96 → 1662.26] I comfort her and heal.
[1662.26 → 1672.26] Lord, my heart's desire is to be filled with spirit fire.
[1672.26 → 1680.56] My purpose is to worship you alone.
[1680.56 → 1691.56] Open up my soul to worship and adore.
[1691.56 → 1700.56] To be a fragrance proper to your throne.
[1700.56 → 1710.56] I lift your name, your holy name.
[1710.56 → 1716.56] The great I am, the risen Lamb.
[1716.56 → 1718.56] And all here.
[1718.56 → 1726.56] The great I am, the risen Lamb.
[1726.56 → 1736.56] The risen Lamb, my comfort and king.
[1736.56 → 1738.56] The great I am, the risen Lamb.
[1738.56 → 1740.56] The great I am, the risen Lamb.
[1740.56 → 1742.56] The great I am, the risen Lamb.
[1742.56 → 1743.56] The great I am, the risen Lamb.
[1743.56 → 1744.56] The great I am, the risen Lamb.
[1744.56 → 1748.56] The great I am, the risen Lamb.
[1748.56 → 1749.56] The great I am, the risen Lamb.
[1749.56 → 1754.56] The great I am, the risen Lamb.
[1754.56 → 1758.56] The great I am, the risen Lamb.
[1758.56 → 1780.56] The great I am, the risen Lamb.
[1780.56 → 1781.56] Amen.
[1810.56 → 1811.56] Amen.
[1840.56 → 1860.56] If you stood before my failure and carried the cross for my shame, my sin weighed upon your shoulder, my soul now to stand.
[1860.56 → 1872.56] So what can I say, and what can I do?
[1872.56 → 1883.56] For all through this heart, O God, completely is true.
[1883.56 → 1895.56] So I'll walk upon salvation, your spirit alive in me.
[1895.56 → 1904.56] My life to declare your promise, my soul now to stand.
[1904.56 → 1915.56] So what can I say, and what can I do?
[1915.56 → 1927.56] For all through this heart, O God, completely to you?
[1927.56 → 1938.56] So what can I say, and what can I do?
[1938.56 → 1949.56] For all through this heart, O God, completely to you?
[1949.56 → 1969.56] So I'll stand with arms high and heart of ending in awe of the one who gave it all.
[1969.56 → 1991.56] So I'll stand with arms high and heart of ending in awe of the one who gave it all.
[1991.56 → 2014.56] I'll stand with arms high and heart of ending in awe of the one who gave it all.
[2014.56 → 2023.56] So I'll stand with arms high and heart of ending in awe of the one who gave it all.
[2023.56 → 2024.56] I'll stand, my soul, Lord, to you. Surrender it all.
[2024.56 → 2025.56] I am is yours.
[2025.56 → 2030.56] I am is yours.
[2030.56 → 2032.56] Amen.
[2032.56 → 2033.56] Amen.
[2033.56 → 2049.56] Good morning.
[2049.56 → 2050.56] Good morning.
[2050.56 → 2054.56] My name is Brenda, and I'm one of the deacons here at Emmanuel.
[2054.56 → 2058.56] First off, just, I guess you could call it a little bit of housekeeping.
[2058.56 → 2063.56] There are multiple ways to give as we give as we continue our worship.
[2063.56 → 2066.56] And they're up on the screen here.
[2066.56 → 2072.56] And our first, our offering is for the budget as well as for World Renew.
[2072.56 → 2083.56] If you are looking to donate, whether it's through e-transfer, whether it's online, whether it's with the envelopes that should be in the seats,
[2083.56 → 2089.56] please label it, if it's budget, if it's for a special offering.
[2089.56 → 2094.56] We have the ongoing need for Jodi and Ariel in Mexico.
[2094.56 → 2099.56] If you could label that for C10, that would be great.
[2099.56 → 2105.56] Our offering this morning is for World Renew, the refugee sponsorship and resettlement.
[2105.56 → 2114.56] Again, just to clarify, here at Emmanuel, we also have a refugee sponsorship and resettlement.
[2114.56 → 2117.56] That is not what today's offering is for.
[2117.56 → 2120.56] Today it is specifically for World Renew.
[2120.56 → 2122.56] Just to make that clear.
[2122.56 → 2127.56] If you have any questions about any of these things, please contact one of the deacons.
[2127.56 → 2129.56] Anyway, World Renew.
[2129.56 → 2136.56] Each year, millions of people around the world are forced to flee their homes due to war, persecution, and human rights violations.
[2136.56 → 2140.56] There are more than 30 million refugees in the world today.
[2140.56 → 2152.56] Since 1979, World Renew, with churches and other sponsoring agencies, has responded to the needs of refugees around the world and has helped to settle thousands in Canada as well.
[2152.56 → 2162.56] Your donation helps to fund World Renew's refugee sponsorship and resettlement program, which includes guiding and supporting churches through the sponsorship process.
[2162.56 → 2166.56] And that is a process that we as a church has also been involved in.
[2166.56 → 2169.56] Please give as the Lord has blessed you.
[2169.56 → 2173.56] One month for a strong project, which is freaking out of led Mosasaurs Loki towards Jesús, who is still this year?
[2173.56 → 2174.56] By objection to 34.
[2174.56 → 2175.56] LPLJ-40 part & Rosette, acer, Lenin Logan, has contracted Meet, High School of colour, dancer, and swearing in Alaska Commander,
[2175.56 → 2180.42] Let the way our student friends go through and will fall together and many people around the world,
[2180.42 → 2194.54] also welcome to friends with the to never
[2194.56 → 2196.56] shall be appropriate for the coming.
[2196.56 → 2207.38] Man of sorrow, Lamb of God, by his own betray.
[2208.28 → 2220.38] The sin of man and wrath of God has been on Jesus' name.
[2220.38 → 2234.38] Silent as he stood accused, beaten, mocked, and scorned.
[2235.28 → 2244.38] Bowing to the Father's veil, he took a crown of thorns.
[2244.38 → 2256.38] Oh, that rugged cross, my salvation, where your love poured out over me.
[2257.52 → 2268.64] Now my soul cries out, Hallelujah, praise and honour unto thee.
[2268.64 → 2282.48] Send to heaven God's own Son to purchase and redeem.
[2282.48 → 2294.48] And reconcile the very ones who nailed him to that tree.
[2294.48 → 2306.82] Oh, that rugged cross, my salvation, where your love poured out over me.
[2307.06 → 2318.24] Now my soul cries out, Hallelujah, praise and honour unto thee.
[2318.24 → 2333.66] Now my debt is paid, it is paid in full, By the precious blood that my Jesus spilled.
[2333.98 → 2345.24] Now the curse of sin has no hold on me, Whom the Son sets free, oh, it's free indeed.
[2345.24 → 2375.22] Now that rugged cross, my salvation, Where your love poured out over me.
[2375.22 → 2391.22] Now my soul cries out, Hallelujah, praise and honour unto thee.
[2391.22 → 2405.22] See the stone is rolled away, Behold the empty tomb.
[2405.22 → 2417.22] Hallelujah, God be praised, He's risen from the grave.
[2417.22 → 2428.22] Oh, that rugged cross, my salvation, Where your love poured out over me.
[2428.22 → 2439.22] Now my soul cries out, Hallelujah, praise and honour unto thee.
[2439.22 → 2447.22] Praise and honour unto thee.
[2447.22 → 2449.86] You may have a seat.
[2469.22 → 2477.22] Good, because I have a little list here.
[2477.22 → 2480.22] Questions, things in life I just cannot figure out.
[2480.22 → 2485.22] But I think you guys probably have some answers for me, right?
[2485.22 → 2486.22] You guys are pretty smart.
[2486.22 → 2489.22] Every week we see you in Children's Poker Time, you guys are pretty smart.
[2489.22 → 2495.22] So I'm going to need some volunteers who might want to answer a few of my conundrums and questions in life.
[2495.22 → 2497.22] Who wants to be the brave souls?
[2497.22 → 2499.22] Come on up, Haley, come on up.
[2499.22 → 2500.22] Want to help me out?
[2500.22 → 2502.22] Come on up, come on up.
[2502.22 → 2503.22] Okay, alright.
[2503.22 → 2505.22] We're going to ask a few questions.
[2505.22 → 2509.22] Life can be super confusing and I never know what's going to happen next day to next.
[2509.22 → 2510.22] So I have a few questions.
[2510.22 → 2511.22] Okay.
[2511.22 → 2512.22] You want to go first?
[2512.22 → 2513.22] Okay.
[2513.22 → 2514.22] My first question, no?
[2514.22 → 2515.22] Okay.
[2515.22 → 2517.22] Well, that was my first question.
[2517.22 → 2518.22] Okay.
[2518.22 → 2519.22] We're going to start with you, Isla.
[2519.22 → 2524.22] My first question is, why can't I ever find my keys?
[2524.22 → 2529.22] Do you know?
[2529.22 → 2530.22] No?
[2530.22 → 2531.22] Okay.
[2531.22 → 2532.22] That's okay.
[2532.22 → 2533.22] You think about it.
[2533.22 → 2536.22] Okay, Haley, this one's for you.
[2536.22 → 2541.22] When you're in a big hurry, why is it that your zipper always gets stuck?
[2541.22 → 2542.22] No, no.
[2542.22 → 2543.22] Not sure?
[2543.22 → 2544.22] I know.
[2544.22 → 2545.22] Life is a little confusing sometimes.
[2545.22 → 2546.22] Okay.
[2546.22 → 2549.22] We're going to go over here.
[2549.22 → 2555.22] My friend, why does it always rain after I've washed my car?
[2555.22 → 2558.22] I don't know.
[2558.22 → 2560.22] Oh, yeah, me neither.
[2560.22 → 2562.22] Oh, these are tricky questions.
[2562.22 → 2564.22] So I have quite a few here.
[2564.22 → 2567.22] We won't do all of them.
[2567.22 → 2568.22] Hmm.
[2568.22 → 2569.22] Okay.
[2569.22 → 2571.22] Here's a tricky one.
[2571.22 → 2573.22] You think some of these are jokes?
[2573.22 → 2576.22] I've been worrying about this stuff all week.
[2576.22 → 2585.22] Why is it when I put two socks, two socks in the laundry and only one comes out?
[2585.22 → 2586.22] You don't know.
[2586.22 → 2587.22] Me neither.
[2587.22 → 2588.22] These are hard.
[2588.22 → 2589.22] I have one.
[2589.22 → 2590.22] Okay.
[2590.22 → 2591.22] Who wants the next one?
[2591.22 → 2594.22] We can ask a few more in children's worship.
[2594.22 → 2595.22] You want the next one?
[2595.22 → 2596.22] Okay.
[2596.22 → 2602.22] When a goldfish sneezes, do bubbles blow out of its mouth?
[2602.22 → 2603.22] Yes.
[2603.22 → 2604.22] Yes.
[2604.22 → 2605.22] Okay.
[2605.22 → 2606.22] Phew.
[2606.22 → 2607.22] Finally an answer.
[2607.22 → 2608.22] I've been worried about this all week.
[2608.22 → 2609.22] Oh, my goodness.
[2609.22 → 2610.22] I know.
[2610.22 → 2611.22] Okay.
[2611.22 → 2613.22] We'll save some of these for the large group.
[2613.22 → 2616.22] But life is confusing sometimes, right?
[2616.22 → 2617.22] Wait a second.
[2617.22 → 2618.22] Oh.
[2618.22 → 2620.22] You want to ask me in children's worship time?
[2620.22 → 2621.22] Okay.
[2621.22 → 2622.22] That's a good idea.
[2622.22 → 2623.22] Oh, boy.
[2623.22 → 2624.22] I know.
[2624.22 → 2626.22] So sometimes life is so confusing, and we don't know what's going to happen one day to the next
[2626.22 → 2628.22] or why certain things happen.
[2628.22 → 2633.22] There is a great lesson in the book of Ecclesiastes about this, and we're going to talk more about
[2633.22 → 2637.22] that in children's worship time and I think Pastor Chris is also going to preach about
[2637.22 → 2638.22] that today too.
[2638.22 → 2639.22] All right.
[2639.22 → 2643.22] So why don't we stand together with the congregation, and we'll bless them as they learn about Ecclesiastes
[2643.22 → 2647.22] and I think they'll bless us in return as we learn a little bit more too.
[2647.22 → 2648.22] All right.
[2648.22 → 2649.22] Together, let's go.
[2649.22 → 2651.22] The Lord be with you.
[2651.22 → 2653.22] And also with you.
[2677.22 → 2678.22] Good morning.
[2678.22 → 2679.22] My name is Dave.
[2679.22 → 2682.22] I'm one of the elders for this part of God's church.
[2682.22 → 2687.22] A couple of announcements from Council before I begin in our church family prayer.
[2687.22 → 2690.22] On November the 24th is our fall AGM.
[2690.22 → 2699.22] We are going to discuss and approve the approved proposed budget for 2026.
[2699.22 → 2702.22] We'll start at 6 p.m. with our TRI soup tournament.
[2702.22 → 2707.22] You are encouraged to bring your favourite or your best soup to share and whoever wins
[2707.22 → 2708.22] will be the champion of the world.
[2708.22 → 2712.22] The meeting will begin at 7 p.m.
[2712.22 → 2715.22] The agenda and the meeting package has already gone out previously.
[2715.22 → 2719.22] If you need a printed copy, please contact the church office.
[2719.22 → 2725.22] And at the end of October we're at 13% behind on our budget giving.
[2725.22 → 2733.22] This is something we talk about every year, and it seems like every year we seem to just meet that need.
[2733.22 → 2742.22] Please consider the budget and the ministry, all the work that our church does as we consider their end of year giving.
[2742.22 → 2751.22] Will you please join me in our church family prayer?
[2751.22 → 2755.22] Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth.
[2755.22 → 2757.22] You have set your glory in the heavens.
[2757.22 → 2764.22] Through the praise of children and infants, you have established a stronghold against your enemies to silence the foe and the avenger.
[2764.22 → 2770.22] When we consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars which you have set in place,
[2770.22 → 2775.22] what is mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings that you care for them.
[2775.22 → 2778.22] Father, it is our joy to be here every Sunday.
[2778.22 → 2781.22] As members of the Christian community and members of Christ's body,
[2781.22 → 2787.22] we gather to celebrate the love that you show your people and to sing praises to your name.
[2787.22 → 2792.22] Father, it is very important that we remember to confess our sins before you.
[2792.22 → 2794.22] In the words of King David,
[2794.22 → 2801.22] Have mercy on us, O God, according to your unfailing love, according to your great compassion, blot out our transgressions.
[2801.22 → 2805.22] Wash away all our iniquity and cleanse us from our sin.
[2805.22 → 2809.22] For we know our transgressions and our sin are always before us.
[2809.22 → 2814.22] Against you, you only, have we sinned and done what is evil in your sight.
[2814.22 → 2818.22] So you are right in your verdict and justified when you judge.
[2818.22 → 2825.22] Father, because our sins are so great, we take great joy in the love and sacrifice of Jesus Christ.
[2825.22 → 2830.22] He has willingly taken our sins upon himself and borne the punishment that we deserve.
[2830.22 → 2833.22] Hallelujah. What a Saviour.
[2833.22 → 2837.22] Father, we come to you because we have many reasons to be thankful.
[2837.22 → 2841.22] We thank you for the changing seasons and the fall weather and the beginning of winter.
[2841.22 → 2847.22] It is an opportunity for all of us to spend time outdoors and to experience the beauty of your creation.
[2847.22 → 2854.22] Father, we look around us, and we see decorations and advertising already dedicated to the commercialization of Christmas.
[2854.22 → 2864.22] As the season of Advent approaches, help us not to be distracted by that competing message and to instead celebrate the coming of Emmanuel, God with us.
[2864.22 → 2868.22] Thank you for that indescribable gift of love.
[2868.22 → 2872.22] We thank you for this congregation and the believers who meet here.
[2872.22 → 2874.22] We thank you for the leadership of this church.
[2874.22 → 2877.22] Pastor Chris, Pastor Kevin, Josh and members of council.
[2877.22 → 2881.22] We thank you for the many ministries of this church.
[2881.22 → 2891.22] Nursery, Children's Worship Time, Gems, Cadets, Youth, Young Adults, Coffee Break, Care Groups, Seniors and other ministries.
[2891.22 → 2894.22] We ask that you bless these ministries and the work that they do.
[2894.22 → 2898.22] May they meet the spiritual and physical needs that we see around us.
[2898.22 → 2904.22] Father, we think of the needs that we have as a Christian community and as citizens of the world.
[2904.22 → 2907.22] We pray again for the conflicts around the world.
[2907.22 → 2913.22] We pray that the shaky ceasefire in Gaza will hold, and the two sides will have sufficient reason to stop this conflict.
[2913.22 → 2920.22] We pray for those suffering from the violence that is continuing in Ukraine and Russia and showing no sign of ending soon.
[2920.22 → 2927.22] We pray for the conflicts that we don't think about as often in Sudan, Myanmar, Yemen and other places.
[2927.22 → 2934.22] Grant all leaders on all sides of all conflicts the wisdom, the humility and the courage to pursue peace.
[2934.22 → 2938.22] Father, we think about the needs of this congregation.
[2938.22 → 2944.22] We pray for the family and the extended family of Maryland's Uncle Walter who passed away last week.
[2944.22 → 2953.22] We pray that the memorial service will be a time for the family not just to mourn but to receive your comfort and to celebrate the love of family and the life he lived.
[2953.22 → 2961.22] And Father, we pray for Pastor Chris as he leads us a study of your word as revealed to the teacher in Ecclesiastes.
[2961.22 → 2965.22] We pray that each of us may find meaning in an age of meaninglessness.
[2965.22 → 2972.22] Father, we pray all these things for Lord our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth.
[2972.22 → 2973.22] Amen.
[2973.22 → 2994.22] I want to invite you to grab a Bible, open up a Bible.
[2994.22 → 2999.22] We're going to read Ecclesiastes 9, verse 1 through 12.
[2999.22 → 3001.22] If you're looking for a Bible to use, there are some at the back.
[3001.22 → 3004.22] You can grab that the first time through.
[3004.22 → 3006.22] It will be on the screen behind me.
[3006.22 → 3012.22] But I encourage you as always to have it open in front of you that we refer back to it regularly throughout.
[3012.22 → 3018.22] Let's read together from Ecclesiastes 9, starting at verse 1.
[3018.22 → 3035.22] So I reflected on all this and concluded that the righteous and the wise and what they do are in God's hands.
[3035.22 → 3039.22] But no one knows whether love or hate awaits them.
[3039.22 → 3042.22] All share a common destiny.
[3042.22 → 3049.22] The righteous and the wicked, the good and the bad, the clean and the unclean,
[3049.22 → 3052.22] those who offer sacrifices and those who do not.
[3052.22 → 3059.22] As it is with the good, so with the sinful.
[3059.22 → 3065.22] As it is with those who take oaths, so with those who are afraid to take them.
[3065.22 → 3072.22] This is the evil in everything that happens under the sun.
[3072.22 → 3075.22] The same destiny overtakes them all.
[3075.22 → 3081.22] The hearts of people, moreover, are full of evil and there is madness in their hearts while they live.
[3081.22 → 3084.22] And afterward, they join the dead.
[3084.22 → 3088.22] Anyone who is among the living has hope.
[3088.22 → 3092.22] Even a live dog is better off than a dead lion.
[3092.22 → 3098.22] For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing.
[3098.22 → 3102.22] They have no further reward and even their name is forgotten.
[3102.22 → 3108.22] Their love, their hate, and their jealousy have long since vanished.
[3108.22 → 3113.22] Never again will they have a part in anything that happens under the sun.
[3113.22 → 3115.22] Go.
[3115.22 → 3121.22] Eat your food with gladness and drink your wine with a joyful heart,
[3121.22 → 3125.22] for God has already approved what you do.
[3125.22 → 3130.22] Be Always clothed in white and always anoint your head with oil.
[3130.22 → 3133.22] Enjoy life with your wife, whom you love,
[3133.22 → 3137.22] all the days of this meaningless life that God has given you under the sun,
[3137.22 → 3145.22] all your meaningless days, for this is your lot in life and your toilsome labour under the sun.
[3145.22 → 3149.22] Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might.
[3149.22 → 3152.22] For in the realm of the dead, where you are going,
[3152.22 → 3158.22] there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.
[3158.22 → 3163.22] I have seen something else under the sun.
[3163.22 → 3167.22] The race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong,
[3167.22 → 3172.22] nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favour to the learned,
[3172.22 → 3177.22] but time and chance happen to them all.
[3177.22 → 3182.22] Moreover, no one knows when their hour will come.
[3182.22 → 3186.22] As fish are caught in a cruel net or birds are taken in a snare,
[3186.22 → 3193.22] so people are trapped by evil times that fall unexpectedly on them.
[3193.22 → 3195.22] This is the word of the Lord.
[3195.22 → 3214.22] Whenever my phone rings, which I confess is not often because people don't really call anymore,
[3214.22 → 3221.22] but whenever my phone rings after 8pm, my heart skips a beat.
[3221.22 → 3227.22] The bottom sort of drops into my stomach, and I wonder, what happened?
[3227.22 → 3229.22] Who died?
[3229.22 → 3231.22] What's gone wrong?
[3231.22 → 3234.22] Now maybe that's in part because I'm a pastor,
[3234.22 → 3240.22] and those late night calls often mean that something has happened,
[3240.22 → 3246.22] but I'm willing to bet that many of you feel the same way
[3246.22 → 3254.22] when you get that late night call or a text that comes in after 10 o'clock, for example.
[3254.22 → 3255.22] Right?
[3255.22 → 3265.22] We live with the low hum of dread that the next notification, the next message, the next headline
[3265.22 → 3271.22] might just unravel that little bit of stability that we have curated.
[3271.22 → 3279.22] And we work so hard to keep life predictable and manageable and under control.
[3279.22 → 3284.22] And we think, if we are just responsible and careful and prayerful,
[3284.22 → 3288.22] shouldn't life reward that?
[3288.22 → 3292.22] Shouldn't things make a little bit of sense?
[3292.22 → 3296.22] Now, let me be really careful. Don't hear what I'm not saying, please.
[3296.22 → 3298.22] Myself, and I speak for Pastor Kevin as well,
[3298.22 → 3301.22] like call after 8 o'clock if you need something.
[3301.22 → 3304.22] Right? Text after 10 if you need to connect.
[3304.22 → 3306.22] We want that connection.
[3308.22 → 3312.22] But there's something in all of us, right,
[3312.22 → 3319.22] that desperately wants life to run on a predictable timetable.
[3319.22 → 3325.22] And so we think that if we are responsible, life should reward us.
[3325.22 → 3329.22] That if we do good, good should return to us.
[3329.22 → 3334.22] That if we love the Lord, then life should at least be manageable.
[3336.22 → 3338.22] But then something happens.
[3339.22 → 3344.22] Life interrupts, sometimes violently, sometimes tragically.
[3344.22 → 3350.22] And when it does, there's a tiny bit of panic in our hearts that sort of,
[3350.22 → 3353.22] maybe this is only in me, but kind of like whisper shouts.
[3353.22 → 3355.22] You know what a whisper shout is?
[3355.22 → 3357.22] Right? That doesn't want to say it, but it's so true.
[3357.22 → 3359.22] It has to break through the noise.
[3359.22 → 3360.22] Right? Wait a minute!
[3360.22 → 3362.22] This isn't supposed to happen!
[3362.22 → 3364.22] I did everything right!
[3367.22 → 3372.22] The teacher in Ecclesiastes leans in at precisely this point.
[3372.22 → 3379.22] And he doesn't offer us a way to control life or even to explain life.
[3379.22 → 3384.22] Instead, the teacher wants to disrupt our regular rhythms
[3384.22 → 3388.22] with a truth that we tend to avoid at all costs.
[3388.22 → 3391.22] That life is unpredictable.
[3393.22 → 3396.22] And death comes to us all.
[3396.22 → 3403.22] And strangely, shockingly perhaps, right, he says that admitting this truth
[3403.22 → 3407.22] is actually the only way to really live.
[3407.22 → 3414.22] Now, if you'll allow me to offer my perspective and analyze for a moment.
[3414.22 → 3415.22] Right?
[3415.22 → 3419.22] If we peel back those late night anxieties,
[3419.22 → 3424.22] what we really long for, I think, is a world that makes sense.
[3424.22 → 3425.22] Right?
[3425.22 → 3428.22] A world where the lines are straight,
[3428.22 → 3430.22] where the outcomes are predictable,
[3430.22 → 3434.22] and where the future is at least somewhat guaranteed.
[3435.22 → 3440.22] And at least available in some way that we can anticipate.
[3441.22 → 3444.22] Right? We long for stability and for control.
[3444.22 → 3449.22] We want to believe that if we live wisely, if we work hard, if we love well,
[3449.22 → 3451.22] if we walk faithfully with God,
[3451.22 → 3457.22] then our life should unfold in an ordinary and orderly way.
[3459.22 → 3465.22] But the teacher, again, is saying something here that we already know in our bones.
[3465.22 → 3468.22] It just doesn't work that way.
[3468.22 → 3472.22] Life isn't like that.
[3474.22 → 3479.22] And what happens to so many of us, and often subconsciously,
[3479.22 → 3483.22] is that because we cannot bear the thought of it,
[3483.22 → 3487.22] we construct entire worldviews and ways of being in the world
[3487.22 → 3493.22] that shield ourselves from this truth and the ache that it creates in us.
[3493.22 → 3500.22] And so, for example, what is regularly referred to as secular modernity,
[3500.22 → 3504.22] secular modernity says that if we gather enough data,
[3504.22 → 3508.22] use the right technology, if we master enough systems,
[3508.22 → 3511.22] we can eliminate unpredictability.
[3511.22 → 3516.22] Right? Safety and medicine and wealth, wealth management,
[3516.22 → 3522.22] these are all good gifts, but we often turn them into talismans
[3522.22 → 3525.22] that we use to ward off uncertainty.
[3527.22 → 3532.22] Likewise, a therapeutic culture tells us that if we manage our emotions,
[3532.22 → 3538.22] if we visualize our successes, set boundaries and curate our habits carefully,
[3538.22 → 3545.22] if we manifest hard enough, we can carve out a life immune to disruption.
[3545.22 → 3549.22] And then similarly, moralism.
[3549.22 → 3552.22] Moralism promises that if we're simply good enough,
[3553.22 → 3557.22] and if we're good parents, if we're good citizens, if we're good Christians,
[3557.22 → 3561.22] God will protect us from the worst of these things.
[3561.22 → 3568.22] And like I said quietly, right, often without saying it out loud,
[3568.22 → 3577.22] we too easily assume the luxury that tragedy belongs to someone else's story.
[3578.22 → 3584.22] That early death or sudden loss or devastating disappointment will not interrupt ours.
[3584.22 → 3587.22] But then it does.
[3588.22 → 3591.22] Some of you know this intimately, personally.
[3592.22 → 3594.22] It always eventually does.
[3595.22 → 3599.22] And when it does, right, the ache breaks through.
[3599.22 → 3606.22] And when it does, the fragile idols that we have hoped would keep us safe crumble.
[3609.22 → 3611.22] That's what the teacher wants to expose this morning.
[3611.22 → 3613.22] The teacher's not being cruel, he's being honest.
[3614.22 → 3618.22] One of the reasons why I love the book of Ecclesiastes,
[3618.22 → 3622.22] and why it's so good in a time and moment like this one,
[3622.22 → 3626.22] is that it names the ache that we spend our lives trying to ignore.
[3628.22 → 3630.22] Right? We are not in control.
[3630.22 → 3632.22] This life will not bow to us.
[3632.22 → 3638.22] And I really think that there is something compelling about the brutal honesty of this book.
[3638.22 → 3648.22] And this ache that we feel in those moments, right, is a doorway to the text of Ecclesiastes 9,
[3648.22 → 3651.22] and I think to the wisdom that God wants us to give.
[3652.22 → 3655.22] Now this text, maybe you noticed it as we read it,
[3655.22 → 3658.22] it's kind of broken down into three sections.
[3658.22 → 3666.22] I'm going to follow that breakdown, but I'm going to put the first section and the third section
[3666.22 → 3670.22] before the middle section, which I think is the main point of the teacher.
[3670.22 → 3673.22] So we will build to the middle section, which is the main point.
[3673.22 → 3682.22] So the teacher begins, we can look at verse one, with a profoundly true and reality-defining sentence.
[3682.22 → 3683.22] He says,
[3683.22 → 3694.22] Now let's be clear, that's sovereignty language, right?
[3694.22 → 3699.22] That is the rule and reign of God over all creation language.
[3699.22 → 3705.22] That's not fate, that's not randomness, that's not detached providence even.
[3705.22 → 3710.22] This is the personal, covenantal hand of God.
[3710.22 → 3715.22] And the teacher here is affirming what all Scripture teaches.
[3715.22 → 3722.22] That our lives unfold not in chaos, but under the comprehensive rule of our Creator.
[3722.22 → 3729.22] But he pairs that, right, he pairs that with a jarring truth.
[3729.22 → 3735.22] No one knows whether love or hate awaits them.
[3735.22 → 3740.22] All share a common destiny, the righteous and the wicked, the good and the bad, the clean and the unclean,
[3740.22 → 3744.22] those who offer sacrifices and those who don't.
[3744.22 → 3752.22] In other words, right, the outward shape of your days, the outward shape of your lives,
[3752.22 → 3756.22] whether it's love or hate, prosperity or adversity, pleasure or pain,
[3756.22 → 3763.22] cannot be used as a barometer of God's attitude towards you.
[3763.22 → 3772.22] Right, this is a direct challenge to the simple moralistic theology and mechanistic idea of providence.
[3772.22 → 3779.22] Right, that kind of idea of God's work in the world is actually more similar to the fates of Greek mythology.
[3779.22 → 3788.22] Right, or more in line with the sort of manifesting that exists in contemporary culture.
[3788.22 → 3792.22] The teacher comes with a hammer blow to all of that.
[3792.22 → 3795.22] Right, all share a common destiny.
[3795.22 → 3797.22] Verse 2 and in verse 5.
[3797.22 → 3806.22] The living know that they will die.
[3806.22 → 3814.22] Death is the one fixed point in the human story.
[3814.22 → 3824.22] And the teacher is forcing us to sit with that reality because death exposes what we worship in life.
[3825.22 → 3827.22] Follow me with that.
[3827.22 → 3833.22] Right, we tend to live as if the one thing that is certain will never come, death,
[3833.22 → 3839.22] and that the many things that are uncertain, health, wealth, stability, success,
[3839.22 → 3844.22] we treat as though they are guaranteed.
[3844.22 → 3848.22] The teacher is refusing to let us do that.
[3848.22 → 3854.22] Right, he dismantles every human attempt to secure life apart from God.
[3854.22 → 3861.22] Right, death is the teacher's megaphone reminding us that we are creatures and not God.
[3861.22 → 3866.22] And this for us is grace.
[3866.22 → 3872.22] Because when our illusions collapse, so do our idolatries.
[3872.22 → 3877.22] Right, verse 1 to 6 show us that death is certain.
[3877.22 → 3884.22] Verse 11 and 12 show us that everything else is uncertain.
[3884.22 → 3889.22] The teacher lists here things that we assume are reliable.
[3889.22 → 3891.22] That the fastest runner will win the race.
[3891.22 → 3893.22] That the strongest soldier will triumph.
[3893.22 → 3895.22] That the wise will excel.
[3895.22 → 3897.22] The skilled will succeed.
[3897.22 → 3900.22] And the knowledgeable will rise to the top.
[3900.22 → 3903.22] But then he says at the end of verse 11,
[3903.22 → 3906.22] Time and chance happen to them all.
[3906.22 → 3910.22] And again, this is not randomness.
[3910.22 → 3917.22] This is what we might call the doctrine of providence, but from the underside.
[3917.22 → 3920.22] Right, the Heidelberg Catechism,
[3920.22 → 3923.22] Confession of Faith of the Reformed Churches from the 16th century.
[3923.22 → 3930.22] The Heidelberg Catechism defines and calls providence both God's almighty and ever-present power
[3930.22 → 3938.22] and also the truth that all things come to us not by chance but by his fatherly hand.
[3938.22 → 3946.22] Right, the teacher's point is not that life is chaotic, but it rather is about perspective on life.
[3946.22 → 3950.22] Right, and his point here is that from the human vantage point,
[3950.22 → 3956.22] outcomes cannot be predicted or guaranteed or controlled.
[3956.22 → 3960.22] From our perspective, limited and short-sighted as it is,
[3960.22 → 3964.22] we cannot see the big picture or make the meaning.
[3964.22 → 3972.22] And so, we think, either there is no meaning, and it's all chance,
[3972.22 → 3978.22] or we think, I must have done something wrong, and I deserve this punishment from God.
[3978.22 → 3981.22] Now hear this.
[3981.22 → 3991.22] In an attempt, pious though it may be, in an attempt to save God from randomness,
[3991.22 → 3995.22] what we end up doing is forcing Him into our view of the world.
[3997.22 → 4002.22] Right, in an attempt to save God from a seeming lack of control,
[4002.22 → 4005.22] we end up making Him vindictive.
[4005.22 → 4008.22] But the teacher's clear, right?
[4008.22 → 4010.22] It's neither of these things.
[4010.22 → 4012.22] Because, like the teacher is saying,
[4012.22 → 4015.22] no amount of wisdom, strength, planning, or virtue can guarantee success.
[4015.22 → 4020.22] Right, disaster, in verse 12, falls unexpectedly upon them.
[4020.22 → 4025.22] Again, this is another blow to the modern idol of mastery.
[4025.22 → 4029.22] Right, we think that if we refine our habits and read the right books,
[4029.22 → 4033.22] if we optimize our schedules, if we secure the right insurances,
[4033.22 → 4037.22] if we obey the right spiritual principles, we can build a predictable life.
[4037.22 → 4041.22] But Ecclesiastes is simply saying, you can't.
[4041.22 → 4048.22] And that reality forces a confrontation.
[4048.22 → 4054.22] That reality forces a confrontation about where you place your hope.
[4054.22 → 4060.22] A biblical anthropology, a biblical way of understanding what it means to be human,
[4060.22 → 4065.22] insists that human beings, even as redeemed creatures though we may be,
[4065.22 → 4070.22] human beings remain finite, remain dependent, remain limited.
[4070.22 → 4073.22] And Ecclesiastes wants to make this abundantly clear.
[4073.22 → 4075.22] We do not rule the world.
[4075.22 → 4078.22] Only God does.
[4078.22 → 4083.22] And so between these two hammer blows,
[4083.22 → 4088.22] the certainty of death and the uncertainty of life,
[4088.22 → 4093.22] stands the surprising centre, culmination of this passage.
[4093.22 → 4096.22] Verse 7, right?
[4096.22 → 4100.22] Go, eat your food with gladness, drink your wine with a joyful heart,
[4100.22 → 4102.22] enjoy life with your wife whom you love.
[4102.22 → 4106.22] Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might.
[4106.22 → 4109.22] Now again, to be clear, this isn't escapism, this isn't hedonism,
[4109.22 → 4113.22] this isn't the same as eat and drink for tomorrow we die.
[4113.22 → 4116.22] What this is, is creaturely humility.
[4116.22 → 4117.22] Right?
[4117.22 → 4121.22] To receive life not as something to control,
[4121.22 → 4125.22] but something to enjoy under the hand of God.
[4125.22 → 4127.22] That's the second part of verse 7, right?
[4127.22 → 4131.22] Go, eat your food with gladness and drink your wine with a joyful heart,
[4131.22 → 4135.22] for God has already approved what you do.
[4136.22 → 4140.22] One of the authors that I've been reading in this series, David Gibson,
[4140.22 → 4147.22] says that verse 7 of chapter 9 is Ecclesiastes in a nutshell.
[4147.22 → 4152.22] Because this verse smashes our desire to be God.
[4152.22 → 4156.22] Right? We want omniscience and omnipotence and omnipresence.
[4156.22 → 4161.22] We want to know it all and to control it all and to secure it all and to understand it all.
[4161.22 → 4163.22] But God says, you are not me.
[4164.22 → 4166.22] And that is good news for you.
[4167.22 → 4169.22] Your life is a gift.
[4169.22 → 4171.22] It's not a project.
[4172.22 → 4177.22] The teacher is naming these particular idolatries that we are tempted to worship.
[4177.22 → 4182.22] And when we worship God's gifts, they no longer remain gifts.
[4182.22 → 4185.22] Right? They start demanding what they cannot give.
[4185.22 → 4192.22] When we make God's good gifts into ultimate things, they twist on us.
[4192.22 → 4202.22] And so the man who makes sex his God finds that normal pleasures stop satisfying
[4202.22 → 4207.22] and he ends up chained to the darker distortions of that that offer no joy.
[4208.22 → 4212.22] To the woman who makes her family her God,
[4212.22 → 4216.22] she discovers that she cannot live up to her own expectations.
[4216.22 → 4221.22] And when your children falter and fail, you're left hollow and disappointed.
[4222.22 → 4228.22] Right? Every gift when worshipped betrays you.
[4229.22 → 4233.22] They promise joy, and they deliver emptiness.
[4233.22 → 4241.22] C.S. Lewis put this profoundly and sharply in a way that really only he can.
[4241.22 → 4242.22] He says,
[4242.22 → 4249.22] Natural loves that are allowed to become gods do not remain loves.
[4249.22 → 4255.22] They're still called so, but can in fact become complicated forms of hatred.
[4255.22 → 4265.22] Make marriage your God and you will hate your spouse.
[4265.22 → 4268.22] Make career your God and you will hate work.
[4268.22 → 4271.22] And Ecclesiastes says,
[4271.22 → 4275.22] Receive these gifts of food and drink and marriage and work,
[4275.22 → 4280.22] not as gods, not as guarantees, not as sources of identity,
[4280.22 → 4285.22] but as daily graces from God who is sovereign and wise and good.
[4285.22 → 4288.22] And let's be really clear, this isn't a downgrade.
[4288.22 → 4293.22] Right? This is the path to freedom.
[4293.22 → 4297.22] Look, this is what we have been seeing.
[4297.22 → 4302.22] Right? Death is certain and everything else is uncertain.
[4302.22 → 4309.22] Our idolatries cannot protect us and our attempts at mastery crumble beneath the weight of reality.
[4309.22 → 4314.22] And when we admit this, we are left with needing to find a better way to live.
[4314.22 → 4321.22] And the teacher is directing us away from control and towards trust,
[4321.22 → 4324.22] away from illusion and towards humility,
[4324.22 → 4332.22] away from self-made security and towards the God who holds all our days in his hand.
[4333.22 → 4335.22] Right? This is the teacher's point.
[4335.22 → 4336.22] This is what we're looking at.
[4336.22 → 4342.22] This is the big idea that life is unpredictable and death comes to us all.
[4342.22 → 4349.22] The wise response then is to receive every moment as a gift from God.
[4349.22 → 4354.22] Receive every moment as a gift from God.
[4354.22 → 4357.22] And that changes every moment.
[4360.22 → 4361.22] Here's the good news.
[4361.22 → 4371.22] Ecclesiastes is not the last word that God speaks into the world of unpredictability and death.
[4371.22 → 4375.22] Do you notice that when I finished reading the text, and we said,
[4375.22 → 4378.22] this is the word of the Lord, and you're supposed to say, thanks be to God.
[4378.22 → 4379.22] It was very half-hearted.
[4379.22 → 4380.22] Thanks be to God.
[4381.22 → 4384.22] Like, is this really what we want to give God thanks for?
[4385.22 → 4386.22] Right?
[4386.22 → 4387.22] But this isn't the last word.
[4388.22 → 4390.22] Ecclesiastes is an honest word.
[4391.22 → 4395.22] And so, thanks be to God for the honesty of God's word that exposes the idols of our heart.
[4395.22 → 4396.22] Yes, it is an honest word.
[4396.22 → 4400.22] But it's an honest word that prepares us for the living word.
[4401.22 → 4403.22] Who steps into the world with us.
[4404.22 → 4405.22] Right?
[4405.22 → 4413.22] Jesus Christ entered life, a life that was marked by the very same uncertainties that Ecclesiastes names
[4413.22 → 4416.22] and that you and I stand in the midst of.
[4416.22 → 4419.22] And Jesus lived with no earthly guarantees.
[4420.22 → 4421.22] That is, he had no wealth.
[4421.22 → 4422.22] He had no status.
[4422.22 → 4424.22] He had no worldly power.
[4424.22 → 4425.22] Right?
[4425.22 → 4426.22] He knew hunger.
[4426.22 → 4427.22] He knew fatigue.
[4427.22 → 4428.22] He knew danger.
[4428.22 → 4429.22] He knew betrayal.
[4429.22 → 4430.22] He knew being misunderstood.
[4431.22 → 4436.22] And in all of that, in all of that, he lived the life I should have lived.
[4436.22 → 4438.22] He did so perfectly.
[4438.22 → 4441.22] And by his grace, he did so for me.
[4441.22 → 4443.22] And he did so for you.
[4444.22 → 4451.22] And yet, even though he was perfectly obedient, even though he was innocent and spotless,
[4451.22 → 4456.22] he walked straight into the reality of that same destiny which overtakes us all.
[4457.22 → 4458.22] Right?
[4458.22 → 4460.22] He entered death itself.
[4460.22 → 4464.22] And not because it overtook him, but because he willingly took it on.
[4464.22 → 4467.22] He died the death that I deserve.
[4467.22 → 4470.22] Now, why would he do all that?
[4470.22 → 4479.22] Well, first, right, and foremost, to break the power of the one certainty that terrifies
[4479.22 → 4487.22] us most, and then to redeem the world of the unpredictability that we live in.
[4487.22 → 4496.22] The book of Hebrews says that Jesus shared in our humanity so that by his death, he might
[4496.22 → 4500.22] break the power of him who holds the power of death.
[4500.22 → 4501.22] Right?
[4501.22 → 4506.22] Because Jesus died and rose, death is no longer a wall that we run into.
[4506.22 → 4510.22] Death is actually the way through to joining him.
[4510.22 → 4514.22] Joining Jesus in his death is actually life.
[4514.22 → 4520.22] And because he lives, you can be sure that every seemingly random and unpredictable moment
[4520.22 → 4523.22] is actually held in his hand.
[4523.22 → 4532.22] If even death has to succumb to his victory, surely to all the troubles, trials, and tribulations of your life.
[4532.22 → 4539.22] And this is the transformation that Ecclesiastes anticipates, but cannot itself produce.
[4539.22 → 4540.22] Right?
[4540.22 → 4546.22] Because ultimately, it's only the gospel, it's only Jesus that can free us from the need to control our own lives.
[4546.22 → 4553.22] And only the Spirit then can loosen our grip on the idols that we think will save us.
[4553.22 → 4557.22] Only union with Christ can make us creaturely again.
[4557.22 → 4561.22] Content in our dependence.
[4561.22 → 4570.22] Joyful to receive and humble enough to enjoy what God gives without demanding more.
[4570.22 → 4579.22] In Jesus, the fear of death is replaced by hope.
[4579.22 → 4584.22] The ache for certainty is replaced with trust.
[4584.22 → 4585.22] Right?
[4585.22 → 4591.22] The frenetic drive to secure our own future is replaced by a confidence that, as we read in Colossians 3,
[4591.22 → 4596.22] your life is now hidden with Christ in God.
[4596.22 → 4597.22] Right?
[4597.22 → 4599.22] This is how grace heals us.
[4599.22 → 4606.22] Christ takes the one certainty we dread and turns it into our deepest security.
[4606.22 → 4610.22] So that we can finally live the way that Ecclesiastes is inviting us to live.
[4610.22 → 4616.22] As a people who receive life rather than try to grasp it from different places.
[4616.22 → 4619.22] Trying to steal a moment here and there.
[4622.22 → 4624.22] And so how do we live this way?
[4624.22 → 4625.22] Right?
[4625.22 → 4629.22] Receiving life rather than trying to control it.
[4629.22 → 4636.22] Ecclesiastes gives us a surprisingly ordinary answer.
[4636.22 → 4647.22] The Christian life, lived under the sovereignty of God and in the grace of Christ, looks like faithfulness in the small things.
[4647.22 → 4656.22] I'm going to end our time this morning with four ways that this passage shapes our daily obedience.
[4656.22 → 4659.22] Four ways this passage shapes faithfulness in the small things.
[4659.22 → 4668.22] And so first, receive today as a gift, not as a guarantee.
[4668.22 → 4670.22] Receive today as a gift, not as a guarantee.
[4670.22 → 4672.22] The teacher says in verse 7,
[4672.22 → 4676.22] Go, eat your food with gladness and drink your wine with a joyful heart.
[4676.22 → 4677.22] Right?
[4677.22 → 4678.22] That's not indulgence.
[4678.22 → 4679.22] That's worship.
[4680.22 → 4688.22] Every meal, every breath, every mundane joy is a reminder that you are not God and you do not need to be.
[4688.22 → 4691.22] And so slow down.
[4691.22 → 4693.22] Give thanks.
[4693.22 → 4698.22] Name the grace that's in front of you.
[4698.22 → 4705.22] I was talking with a friend this week, and she's not Christian.
[4705.22 → 4715.22] She mentioned that she felt like she was crashing after the super chaotic season of life that she's been in the last number of months.
[4715.22 → 4720.22] And that in that crash, she's really been struggling to find motivation again.
[4720.22 → 4727.22] And in our conversation, I reminded her, you know, it's okay to rest.
[4727.22 → 4730.22] It's okay to slow down.
[4730.22 → 4731.22] Right?
[4731.22 → 4738.22] When we define ourselves by our busyness, and we try to keep up that busyness so that we don't lose ourselves,
[4738.22 → 4745.22] we often miss resting in God's goodness.
[4745.22 → 4750.22] When today is received as a gift, we remember to rest.
[4750.22 → 4759.22] Number two, practice contentment by refusing to worship God's gifts.
[4759.22 → 4762.22] Enjoy your spouse.
[4762.22 → 4763.22] Enjoy your work.
[4763.22 → 4764.22] Enjoy your children.
[4764.22 → 4765.22] Enjoy your community.
[4765.22 → 4769.22] Enjoy your sports and your hobbies and your recreations.
[4769.22 → 4772.22] But do not ask them to save you.
[4772.22 → 4773.22] Right?
[4773.22 → 4779.22] As Lewis warned, natural loves that are allowed to become gods become forms of hatred.
[4779.22 → 4790.22] The Spirit is forming us into a people who enjoy deeply because we no longer demand ultimacy from anything but Christ.
[4790.22 → 4797.22] And we stop, when we stop looking to these lesser glories, glories though they are,
[4797.22 → 4804.22] when we stop looking to these lesser glories for meaning or value and start rightly glorifying God,
[4804.22 → 4811.22] the weight of glory that belongs to Him no longer crushes these other things and people around us.
[4811.22 → 4821.22] But in fact, instead, in this beautiful inversion gives us a firm foundation on which and in which we can face all the struggles of life.
[4821.22 → 4822.22] Right?
[4822.22 → 4834.22] Contentment with God's gifts enables community in God's gifts and perhaps even enables community as God's gift.
[4834.22 → 4837.22] 3.
[4837.22 → 4841.22] Do all your work with all your might.
[4841.22 → 4846.22] Not to secure your future, but to honour the one who holds it.
[4846.22 → 4847.22] Right?
[4847.22 → 4848.22] We read in verse 10,
[4848.22 → 4851.22] Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might.
[4851.22 → 4857.22] You cannot control the outcomes, but you can be faithful at the moment.
[4857.22 → 4863.22] You cannot govern providence, but you can live your life as a vocation to God.
[4863.22 → 4866.22] You can live your life before the face of God.
[4866.22 → 4870.22] The theological way of saying that in Latin is forum Do.
[4870.22 → 4871.22] Right?
[4871.22 → 4872.22] Before the face of God.
[4872.22 → 4878.22] In the Bible, one of the words for worship is also the word for work.
[4878.22 → 4885.22] So in Genesis, when you read, God has given them to work and to take care of the garden.
[4885.22 → 4891.22] And then later on in Exodus, when you read Moses and God talking and God says,
[4891.22 → 4896.22] When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain.
[4896.22 → 4898.22] Work and worship.
[4898.22 → 4900.22] Same Hebrew word.
[4900.22 → 4907.22] Work becomes worship when the results belong to God.
[4907.22 → 4908.22] God.
[4908.22 → 4918.22] I want you to listen carefully to this, what I think is a beautiful saying from John Calvin.
[4918.22 → 4922.22] It was written in the 16th century.
[4922.22 → 4924.22] You'll see part of it on the screen.
[4924.22 → 4927.22] There's a little bit of an introduction.
[4927.22 → 4936.22] Since we are consecrated and dedicated to God, we should no longer think, speak, plan, or act without aiming at His glory.
[4936.22 → 4943.22] What He has made holy cannot be turned to common use without deeply offending Him.
[4943.22 → 4953.22] And if we are not our own, but belong to the Lord, then it is plain both what we must avoid and toward what end our whole life must be directed.
[4953.22 → 4959.22] We are not our own, therefore our own reason or will must not rule our decisions.
[4959.22 → 4965.22] We are not our own, therefore let us not make it our aim to pursue what pleases our sinful nature.
[4965.22 → 4972.22] We are not our own, therefore as far as is possible, let us forget ourselves and everything that is ours.
[4972.22 → 4977.22] On the other hand, we are God's, therefore let us live and die for Him.
[4977.22 → 4981.22] We are God's, therefore let His wisdom and His will govern all our actions.
[4981.22 → 4990.22] We are God's, therefore to Him as our only true end, let every part of our life be directed.
[4990.22 → 4995.22] We are God's, therefore, we are God's, therefore, we are God's.
[4995.22 → 5002.22] So our work is our worship and our worship is what we were made to do.
[5002.22 → 5013.22] And then lastly, four, let the certainty of Christ's resurrection free you from the fear of death.
[5013.22 → 5019.22] Yes, this is a practical way and truth coming out of this text.
[5019.22 → 5029.22] Because Jesus has gone ahead of you into the grave and has come out the other side, you no longer have to cling anxiously to life.
[5029.22 → 5034.22] You can step into each day with courage and humility and joy.
[5034.22 → 5040.22] When death is no longer the great threat, life becomes the great gift.
[5040.22 → 5047.22] And as Christians, we don't have to fear death.
[5047.22 → 5055.22] But nor do we have to rush towards it or accelerate its coming to us.
[5055.22 → 5067.22] In a strange and maybe paradoxical way, people who are choosing death early do so because they are afraid of how death may come later.
[5067.22 → 5071.22] But we don't have to be afraid.
[5071.22 → 5076.22] Right now or then, we don't have to make decisions based on fear.
[5076.22 → 5078.22] Especially fear of the unknown.
[5078.22 → 5084.22] Because to God, right, to God everything is known.
[5084.22 → 5087.22] And He knows you're everything.
[5087.22 → 5091.22] And He is with you in everything.
[5091.22 → 5107.22] In a world where people chase control and end up crushed by our own expectations, Ecclesiastes is offering a better way.
[5107.22 → 5115.22] The grounded, joyful, humble life of a creature who trusts your Creator.
[5116.22 → 5120.22] Yes, life is unpredictable and death comes to us all.
[5120.22 → 5129.22] But because God is faithful and because Jesus has conquered death, we can receive every moment as a gift from God.
[5129.22 → 5136.22] And so, we live, we worship, and we go with Him.
[5136.22 → 5137.22] Amen?
[5137.22 → 5138.22] Let's pray together.
[5138.22 → 5146.22] Let's pray together.
[5146.22 → 5159.22] Lord God, may we see this life as your gift to us.
[5159.22 → 5169.22] Lord Jesus, may we see new life as your gift of grace to us who believe.
[5169.22 → 5178.22] And so, in this life and with this new life, may we go forward from this place not afraid.
[5178.22 → 5185.22] May we go forward from this place knowing that you go with us.
[5185.22 → 5188.22] That you have prepared a way for us.
[5188.22 → 5197.22] May we go forward knowing that every moment of every day is held in your hands.
[5197.22 → 5207.22] And so, may we go forward with the sure conviction of your promise and your presence.
[5207.22 → 5212.22] Strengthen our hearts of faith, we pray.
[5212.22 → 5213.22] Our hearts of faith is truly important and gracious.
[5213.22 → 5215.22] worry his water and heavenly quiets our thoughts on our throne.
[5215.22 → 5216.22] Great confessionally.
[5216.22 → 5217.22] Amen.
[5217.22 → 5226.22] And that in those moments where we cannot see, that we might believe and know, and we might trust that you are with us.
[5226.22 → 5230.80] and lastly, in those moments where even that is hard,
[5231.88 → 5235.04] we give you thanks for these men and women,
[5235.18 → 5236.32] these brothers and sisters,
[5236.78 → 5240.16] these fellow family members of God
[5240.16 → 5242.78] who journey life with us,
[5243.24 → 5245.44] to uphold us and support us,
[5245.56 → 5248.68] and to speak a word of hope and encouragement
[5248.68 → 5250.00] when we hear nothing.
[5251.68 → 5254.30] For all these gifts, we give you thanks, Jesus.
[5254.30 → 5256.50] It's in your name that we pray.
[5257.44 → 5257.84] Amen.
[5258.66 → 5259.24] Amen.
[5284.30 → 5314.30] 
[5314.30 → 5316.30] Amen.
[5316.30 → 5319.30] Through it all, through it all,
[5320.24 → 5322.30] my eyes are on you,
[5323.26 → 5328.30] and it is well with me.
[5328.30 → 5344.66] Far be it from me to not be free,
[5344.66 → 5351.06] even when my eyes can't see,
[5351.06 → 5357.44] and this mountain that's in front of me
[5357.44 → 5363.80] will be thrown into the midst of the sea.
[5363.80 → 5368.80] Through it all, through it all,
[5368.80 → 5369.74] through it all,
[5369.74 → 5372.44] my eyes are on you,
[5372.44 → 5375.12] through it all,
[5375.26 → 5376.26] through it all,
[5376.32 → 5378.36] it is well.
[5379.94 → 5382.24] Through it all,
[5382.40 → 5383.68] through it all,
[5383.68 → 5386.56] my eyes are on you,
[5386.56 → 5389.26] and it is well,
[5389.26 → 5393.68] it is well.
[5393.68 → 5395.68] So let go,
[5396.78 → 5397.68] my soul,
[5398.54 → 5401.60] and trust in Him,
[5401.82 → 5403.66] the ways that wind
[5403.66 → 5407.68] still knows His name.
[5407.68 → 5409.82] So let go,
[5409.82 → 5411.82] my soul,
[5412.82 → 5415.72] and trust in Him,
[5415.72 → 5417.80] the ways that wind
[5417.80 → 5421.82] still knows His name.
[5422.82 → 5423.82] So let go,
[5423.82 → 5425.82] my soul,
[5426.82 → 5429.82] and trust in Him,
[5430.14 → 5431.88] the ways that wind
[5431.88 → 5435.82] still knows His name.
[5435.82 → 5438.76] The ways that wind
[5438.76 → 5442.82] still knows His name.
[5442.82 → 5449.82] It is well
