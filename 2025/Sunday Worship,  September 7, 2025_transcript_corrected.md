[434.26 → 445.84] Stand up. Today's your birthday? How old are you? She's a teenager! Yay! Is there another birthday?
[445.84 → 452.62] What's your name? What's your last name? Are you Kevin's daughter?
[452.62 → 464.08] That's awesome. Is she your oldest? You must be so proud. Are you crying right now? Yes. That's so
[464.08 → 472.30] great. Happy birthday to you too. Okay, so right now we have to do some stretching before we get into
[472.30 → 476.62] church because maybe some of you are a little bit tired from not sleeping so much. So there's a very
[476.62 → 482.86] first one is when we can raise the hands in the singing then you can all we should all be standing
[482.86 → 489.18] up for the stretching yeah so we can raise the hands for the singing, and then we can put in a big
[489.18 → 501.66] stretch yeah yeah so see praising the lord and the big stretch yeah it's so good yeah okay swans what's the next one?
[501.66 → 507.50] Sometimes you're listening to the pastor and the pastor's been going on for 45 minutes, and you think
[507.50 → 513.18] it's time to wrap this up Dave and you might be feeling a little tired so you're going to yawn but
[513.18 → 520.22] you don't want anybody to see you so you're going to do a yawning with your mouth closed stretching the face
[520.22 → 536.86] oh yeah yeah it's very good for stretching the face now we also have said uh passing of the baton
[536.86 → 544.06] so we need you sitting down for this one okay, and we will be asking for the help from over here and over
[544.06 → 549.58] here and over here so what you are doing is you are taking the baton which is the king peppermint for the
[549.58 → 557.02] service these can only be opened once uh pastor green comes up and starts to do his talking then
[557.02 → 562.54] you will open this and pass a peppermint down the line but right now we are passing the
[562.54 → 567.58] baton so can I sit where you are sitting this is how you pass a baton you get one, and you go
[568.62 → 573.98] behind you give it to the next one they pass it all the way down it's all every row has a roll of
[573.98 → 582.94] peppermint so here we go we start with you the baton back, back yeah great and back with your arm with
[582.94 → 590.54] your arm back great all the way excellent you have two more passing of the baton
[593.10 → 593.42] yeah
[593.42 → 603.58] passing of the batons
[605.90 → 606.14] yeah
[608.70 → 617.98] okay we uh remember you are passing the peppermints along with you yeah okay so we have one last
[617.98 → 623.18] stretch that you are doing and everyone needs to stand up for this one is that is of course the
[623.18 → 628.86] classic Hans and Franz deep lunch yeah doing the deep lunch
[633.66 → 638.38] maybe you are asking yourself why are we doing the deep lunches in church
[639.10 → 644.62] because maybe there will be a time as the collection plate is being passed along
[644.62 → 650.62] and somebody drops the collection plate then you can launch and catch it so that we don't lose the
[650.62 → 657.26] money for the church because they are doing renovations, and they may need it yeah so than of course the
[657.26 → 667.34] advanced version of this the deep lunches you do this switching in one two three oh oh oh Hans
[667.34 → 675.82] oh Hans are you all right oh this is not great for the youth to see no I think I pulled the hamstring
[678.62 → 681.66] you can sit down for one minute while I catch my breath
[685.90 → 686.46] I'm sorry
[689.50 → 694.70] yeah the pastor of winter had said that maybe I shouldn't do the switch anymore because my
[694.70 → 704.78] hamstring was getting tired Hans uh swans I don't think so I can keep up with this youth anymore
[704.78 → 712.70] I'm getting old Hans you've been leading reactivate for 10 years now yes, and now you are not as uh
[713.50 → 723.10] young as you want no, no you're not as spry as you want to work so maybe it is time in your old age yes
[723.10 → 732.62] you're not as you want to move on to a new age demographic what are you saying well I hear that
[732.62 → 740.54] they pay top dollar for movement instructors at retirement homes no, no no yeah yeah I'm not so old
[740.54 → 748.54] yet swans I said I need to go to the senior home I am Hans from the Hans and Franco one time I was
[748.54 → 756.46] leading 10 000 youth in a stadium, and they were doing synchronized lunches it was a dream moment in
[756.46 → 765.26] my life it was not 10 000 youth it was 200 and all of them were posting you on Snapchat oh yes but I don't
[765.26 → 771.90] think that working with senior citizens appeals to me, I'm not that old it doesn't appeal to me yet well
[771.90 → 781.42] then let me appeal to your wallet yes is that actually how much a movement coach makes yeah
[782.06 → 790.30] and that is monthly too at elam village Kevin Robert has never paid me that kind of money
[790.30 → 800.22] no 10 years of reactivate okay maybe I can see it now yeah Hans is putting a Hansen France twist at
[800.22 → 807.82] Elam yeah in surrey and then the second campus in Chilean yeah yeah, and we do wheelchair Zumba
[808.46 → 816.62] with abba remixes yes this is a great idea yeah okay reactivate thank you so much for 10 amazing years

[1374.38 → 1376.38] Where you're equipped to be the light.
[1376.38 → 1383.86] I'm going to make it brighter.
[1388.80 → 1391.02] Thank you so much to our schools.
[1391.02 → 1398.62] Not only for being here this weekend, our Christian universities, but for sponsoring Reactivate and making it possible for us to have this weekend together.
[1399.38 → 1403.70] Welcome to our final general session of Reactivate 2025.
[1403.70 → 1409.18] Welcome, especially if you are joining us here for the first time this weekend because you're part of Langley Emanuel CRC.
[1409.18 → 1416.12] We are so glad that you are here and get to just have a little taste of what this amazing weekend has been like for our youth and youth leaders.
[1416.12 → 1425.60] This weekend would not be possible with about 80 people who volunteer and give of their time to make it happen.
[1425.60 → 1435.60] These approximately 80 people have done a number of different things leading up to the weekend and many of them have been here this weekend.
[1435.60 → 1437.96] And you've seen them, and you've interacted with them.
[1437.96 → 1442.08] So we just want to take a moment to say some thank yous to some specific people.
[1442.08 → 1446.08] One of the highlights of the weekend, of course, is the food that we eat.
[1446.08 → 1449.56] We would not be able to enjoy this weekend without sustenance.
[1449.56 → 1453.56] And so we are grateful to Faye and her amazing team of Kitchen volunteers.
[1453.56 → 1454.56] So shout out to Faye.
[1454.56 → 1467.56] And standing right beside her is Rachel, who has coordinated and organized all the other volunteers for the weekend.
[1467.56 → 1471.16] People who clean and help and set up and take down.
[1471.16 → 1473.40] So we are thankful for each one of you.
[1476.40 → 1479.96] Matt and Linda and the AV crew at the back, we love you.
[1479.96 → 1481.04] Thank you for being here.
[1485.32 → 1491.00] We want to specifically say thank you to this church for hosting us for Reactivate for the last three years.
[1491.16 → 1492.52] Emanuel, you are amazing.
[1492.78 → 1493.42] We love you.
[1493.70 → 1496.26] Thank you for letting us tear apart your building.
[1496.26 → 1498.66] Well, okay, we didn't do all of this.
[1499.62 → 1502.66] But, you know, we've probably left a few dents in the last few years.
[1502.66 → 1509.02] And we are so grateful for your space and your hospitality to us for this weekend, the last three years.
[1509.02 → 1509.58] Thank you.
[1514.44 → 1519.56] Our worship leaders this year, Josh, Jordan, and Dave, thank you for being here and leading us in worship.

[1528.34 → 1529.24] We are going to miss you.
[1529.24 → 1530.24] I don't know.
[1530.24 → 1530.80] Are you here?
[1530.80 → 1531.48] Konrad?
[1531.48 → 1531.92] Seth?

[1536.20 → 1537.20] Thank you.
[1537.20 → 1542.70] Youth leaders.
[1542.70 → 1548.50] If you are here as a youth leader from a church, from this church or from another church, can you please stand up for a minute?
[1548.50 → 1552.76] If you are a youth leader that has given up your time to be here this weekend.
[1553.90 → 1555.30] Look at them all.
[1555.48 → 1558.52] Look at these beautiful people who love you so much.
[1558.52 → 1563.40] Some of them drove for several hours to be here.
[1563.96 → 1564.56] Thank you.
[1564.64 → 1564.98] Thank you.
[1565.04 → 1565.68] You may be seated.
[1565.82 → 1566.82] And, of course, youth.
[1567.50 → 1569.10] We wouldn't be here if you weren't here.
[1569.20 → 1577.94] And so we're grateful for you being here and being amazing people for us to spend the weekend with, for taking care of one another, for taking care of the space,
[1577.94 → 1588.26] for being willing to step out in faith if this was a hard thing for you to do to be here this weekend, for being willing to be open to God's voice, to grow in your faith this weekend.
[1588.26 → 1595.32] And we hope that this is just a reflection of what's going to happen in your life this year as you continue on.
[1596.00 → 1600.38] The last two people that I'd like to introduce and thank are the Reactivate planning team.
[1600.84 → 1601.88] So if you guys can come up.
[1603.00 → 1605.28] Can you see them on camera if they just stand, like, right here?
[1605.36 → 1606.72] Should they come right on stage with me?
[1606.72 → 1607.98] Okay.
[1613.50 → 1615.98] You guys, these are the people that make it happen.
[1615.98 → 1619.40] Caitlin, Kevin, Ben, Curtis, and me, Natasha.
[1620.04 → 1620.78] We love it.
[1621.02 → 1623.06] We spend all year getting ready for this weekend.
[1623.24 → 1627.88] It is one of the highlights of our jobs as most of us are youth pastor type people.
[1628.08 → 1629.04] And it's amazing.
[1629.44 → 1632.28] And a round of applause for these people.
[1636.72 → 1638.94] Thank you.
[1639.38 → 1642.84] And with that, I'd like to hand it over to Pastor Chris from Langley Emanuel CRC.
[1642.90 → 1645.74] And he's going to bring us into worship this morning.
[1645.98 → 1646.98] Thank you.
[1646.98 → 1650.48] Thank you, Natasha.
[1650.48 → 1652.08] Let's hear it for Natasha as well.
[1652.16 → 1652.56] Thank you.
[1652.56 → 1668.64] I just want to take this time and thank you all on behalf of Langley Emanuel for being here and for the amazing stories we've already heard and the way that we have seen God at work.
[1668.64 → 1677.16] It's our deep prayer that God will continue to work in you and shape you, continue to draw you to himself.
[1677.86 → 1679.80] We're going to do that in our worship together.
[1679.80 → 1684.34] And so before we begin our worship in earnest, I have one announcement for Langley Emanuel.
[1684.84 → 1686.46] And so Langley Emanuel, this one's for you.
[1686.70 → 1688.08] And maybe East Hill Vernon.
[1688.42 → 1690.12] I'm not sure, but maybe East Hill Vernon.
[1690.94 → 1695.16] The Mexico mission sign up is live now.
[1695.52 → 1700.82] And so every year we send a team to Mexico March 14 to 24 this year.
[1700.90 → 1705.38] If you are interested in going, please, the sign-up is in the e-bulletin or Brandon.
[1705.60 → 1706.66] Brandon, are you here somewhere?
[1706.86 → 1707.60] Brandon over there.
[1707.64 → 1708.38] You can talk to him.
[1708.38 → 1709.72] He would love to make that happen.
[1710.40 → 1712.20] That's all the announcements I'm going to make this morning.
[1712.38 → 1715.98] So I'm going to invite you, as you're able, to stand together.
[1716.60 → 1727.08] I'm going to usher us into worship with God's greeting because we know that God is in this place this morning as he has been all weekend long in your worship together.
[1727.54 → 1734.62] Following God's greeting from me, I'm going to invite you to turn to those around you and extend that greeting to everyone here.
[1734.62 → 1738.88] And so you can do that by passing the peace of Christ, by saying the peace of Christ be with you.
[1738.88 → 1741.12] You can do that by saying the Lord be with you.
[1741.50 → 1745.52] If you know the person beside you really well, you can give them a hug.
[1745.80 → 1747.92] You can shake their hand or a fist bump.
[1748.12 → 1752.22] If you get those weird eyes from the person beside you, just stay back and say the Lord be with you.
[1752.22 → 1759.12] Receive the greeting of our good God this morning in our worship.
[1760.12 → 1771.94] Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Saviour, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[1771.94 → 1774.38] All God's people said, Amen.
[1801.94 → 1802.84] Please, shame.
[1802.94 → 1804.94] Roger IVs, yea?
[1804.94 → 1805.92] Please, cleanse outside your ...
[1805.92 → 1835.90] Thank you.
[1835.90 → 1857.06] Good morning, everybody. Good morning, Reactivate. Good morning, Langley Emanuel. My name is Joshua, as they mentioned. This is Jordan. We've had the privilege of leading all weekends. We're going to start with our call to worship out of Psalm 34. It's going to be on the screen. If you want to read along, I invite you to speak these words out loud together. Starting in verse one.
[1857.06 → 1867.70] I will bless the Lord at all times. His praise shall continually be in my mouth. My soul makes his boast in the Lord. Let the humble hear and be glad.
[1868.44 → 1872.40] Oh, magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together.
[1872.40 → 1883.30] I sought the Lord, and he answered me and delivered me from all my fears. Those who look to him are radiant, and their faces shall never be ashamed.
[1884.10 → 1894.82] This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles. The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him and delivers them.
[1894.82 → 1901.52] Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good. Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.
[1902.04 → 1906.68] Oh, fear the Lord, you his saints. For those who fear him have no lack.
[1907.32 → 1913.40] The young lions suffer in wanton hunger, but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing.
[1913.40 → 1920.40] We're going to begin this morning singing a song we've sung this weekend based on the Lord's Prayer.
[1921.18 → 1923.44] And so for those of you, this is going to be the first time hearing it.
[1923.44 → 1926.42] I'm going to teach you the bridge first and then the chorus, and we'll sing it together.
[1927.08 → 1928.38] So the bridge goes like this.
[1928.38 → 1934.62] The kingdom is already yours.
[1934.62 → 1956.98] Here's the chorus.
[1956.98 → 1986.96] I agree.
[1986.98 → 2008.46] Good and gracious Father, only is it made.
[2008.46 → 2015.08] My heart reflects your kindness, and it's humidity made.
[2015.08 → 2019.08] You've been given to me today.
[2019.08 → 2023.08] The bridge you know I need.
[2023.08 → 2026.08] The bridge for my transgressors.
[2026.08 → 2030.08] You've forgiven me.
[2030.08 → 2034.08] As in heaven so on earth.
[2034.08 → 2038.08] May your kingdom reign in me.
[2038.08 → 2042.08] As above so on earth.
[2042.08 → 2044.08] As above so low.
[2044.08 → 2046.08] As in heaven so near.
[2046.08 → 2048.08] As in heaven so near.
[2048.08 → 2050.08] As above so low.
[2050.08 → 2052.08] As in heaven so near.
[2052.08 → 2058.08] As above so near.
[2058.08 → 2064.08] As above so near.
[2064.08 → 2066.08] So near.
[2066.08 → 2068.08] Yes.
[2068.08 → 2070.08] As above so near.
[2070.08 → 2071.08] God and gracious.
[2071.08 → 2079.14] Good and gracious, Father, holy is your name.
[2079.14 → 2085.70] My heart reflects your kindness, never taking it in vain.
[2087.22 → 2093.34] You've unto me today, but you know I need it.
[2094.24 → 2099.66] The grace for my transgressors is you forgiving me.
[2099.66 → 2106.66] The grace for my transgressors is you forgiving me.
[2107.70 → 2110.36] Is it heaven so unheard?
[2111.26 → 2113.66] May your kingdom reign in me.
[2114.76 → 2120.96] There's no love so low until the day your will's complete.
[2121.76 → 2127.66] I keep praying the same prayer until I'm in and at your feet.
[2127.66 → 2135.66] There's no love so low as in heaven so in me.
[2139.66 → 2142.66] So in me.

[3099.34 → 3107.88] That we don't want to just reflect Your image in Word, but we want our lives and our deeds to reflect that as well.
[3109.14 → 3116.66] And that by coming under Your Word, singing Your Word, praying together, we can greater conform into Your likeness.
[3116.66 → 3125.38] And so I thank You for the formational work You have done this weekend in the lives across generations.
[3125.62 → 3130.44] I pray that that would continue this morning, that it would carry far, far beyond this weekend.
[3131.40 → 3139.88] That there would be tangible points of Your kingdom advancing that are pointed back to moments of surrender made here.
[3140.62 → 3141.58] We love You.
[3141.70 → 3142.52] We bless Your name.
[3142.58 → 3143.80] We pray in Your name, Jesus.
[3144.80 → 3145.24] Amen.
[3145.24 → 3145.42] Amen.
[3146.02 → 3146.34] Amen.
[3146.56 → 3147.84] Church, you can have a seat.
[3162.08 → 3162.92] Good morning.
[3163.60 → 3164.04] Sorry.
[3165.96 → 3170.32] We've been really blessed to have these guys lead us in worship, so it's been a wonderful weekend with them.
[3170.32 → 3179.94] As well, on behalf of the Langley Emanuel Church family, we have been super blessed to host so many churches from around British Columbia for Reactivate.
[3180.42 → 3187.86] And on top of that, we've had some special guests here from Trinity Western and from Redeemer, sharing and chatting and hanging out with our whole crew.
[3187.86 → 3198.52] On top of that, we've had Chili Ab to share a little bit more about what World Renew does on behalf of the CRC Church.
[3198.64 → 3203.18] It is the arm, it's an international development arm of the Christian Reformed Church.
[3203.18 → 3213.64] And we've had a great chance to get to know him, and he shared with us last night, and we'd like to share that a little bit with the rest of us, after which we will take an offering for World Renew, and I can explain more about that.
[3214.36 → 3214.54] Thanks.
[3214.54 → 3216.52] Good morning, my church.
[3217.62 → 3218.44] How are you doing today?
[3220.60 → 3223.58] I'm just overwhelmed with seeing a lot of young people around.
[3224.34 → 3225.50] It's just amazing to see.
[3226.14 → 3229.64] I've been to more than 50 CRC churches all across Canada.
[3230.28 → 3233.96] Sometimes, some of the churches, the youngest person there are 65 years old.
[3233.96 → 3236.74] I'm being real.
[3236.74 → 3243.02] But to see young faces gives me the assurance that the church is here to stay when we are gone.
[3243.34 → 3244.04] We're older folks.
[3244.80 → 3251.34] So I want to commend our parents, the church community, to invest in the spirituality of the youth.
[3251.96 → 3253.16] They are the leaders of tomorrow.
[3254.54 → 3258.16] If they succeed, we have done our job well.
[3258.50 → 3261.14] If they fail, believe in me, we failed.
[3261.14 → 3269.64] So I commend the leadership of Reactive Act for consistently organizing this wonderful event for the past 10 years.
[3270.04 → 3273.96] And for World Renew, we've been attending, I believe, for the past seven years all the time.
[3274.06 → 3278.40] Sometimes, I email Natasha in February, when I was starting the planning.
[3278.74 → 3279.66] She said, shit, it's February.
[3280.10 → 3286.70] I said, I know, I'm looking forward for September for this Reactive Act because I know the importance of investing in our youth.
[3286.70 → 3297.80] Again, I want to give a thanks to Langley and Emmanuel Niels for your years of support to World Renews Global Ministry.
[3298.40 → 3301.68] You've supported our refugee resettlement program.
[3302.16 → 3305.88] You've supported our program fund and our international disaster response.
[3306.54 → 3312.68] Your contribution has done a lot in improving the livelihood of a lot of folks in the global south.
[3312.68 → 3319.98] And again, I have to tell you that we in the charitable sector are facing a lot of challenges.
[3320.52 → 3325.36] As you know, most of the funding has been cut by some major players in the industry.
[3325.80 → 3329.22] I was privileged to visit Kenya three months ago.
[3330.12 → 3338.58] I was in a rural clinic, you know, attending to our, we have a program where we support pregnant women and nursing moms.
[3338.58 → 3346.20] In that program, there are about 30 families and women singing for, receiving us to visit the clinic.
[3346.90 → 3355.84] And it happens, we have a joint program with the major player of our funding in that area.
[3356.64 → 3360.56] And that was when they announced the cutting of the funding.
[3360.56 → 3367.66] As you know, we, when we have a joint partnership with the organization for funding.
[3368.44 → 3374.58] When they pull out from the player, that means that program might be cut up or reduced.
[3375.06 → 3384.90] So I was sitting in a corner just thinking about who is going to tell these folks that what they are here for might be cut up in the next couple of weeks.
[3384.90 → 3387.36] Friends, friends, these are real.
[3388.44 → 3398.74] People's lives are being affected by the cut of the funding, by the global economical turmoil, by the economic stability going on globally.
[3399.12 → 3400.28] We are facing challenges.
[3401.18 → 3408.42] Church, we hope that God has been sustaining this ministry for the past 62 years.
[3409.48 → 3413.38] Churches like yours have been supporting World Renew for the past 62 years.
[3413.38 → 3418.40] Churches, faithfully, helping and working alongside the global community.
[3419.04 → 3425.72] Helping folks struggling with hunger, with poverty, with segregation, people that are displaced.
[3426.06 → 3428.98] Churches have been faithfully supporting our ministry.
[3429.52 → 3435.12] And we pray, and we believe that God will keep on doing this good work that Churches have been supporting.
[3435.28 → 3437.50] Again, I commend all the youths for coming.
[3438.24 → 3442.56] When I was younger, my mom used to put me in all programs, almost every weekend.
[3442.56 → 3444.88] I hated it so much.
[3445.40 → 3446.58] But I have to thank my mom.
[3447.08 → 3450.62] Because of that program that I attend to the churches, I've been alive today.
[3451.52 → 3455.42] I've been out of trouble because of attending all this kind of programs.
[3455.80 → 3457.88] So parents, please keep on sending your kids.
[3458.38 → 3459.82] Next year, we're going to be here.
[3459.88 → 3461.82] I want to see double this size.
[3461.82 → 3468.54] Because investing in kids is the most important thing churches and parents should keep on doing.
[3468.98 → 3472.82] Because if you don't invest in the kids, the society is going to take them from us.
[3473.28 → 3477.50] God, please, I commend you to keep on supporting World Renew in our ministry.
[3478.28 → 3481.06] By prayers, not just by financial support.
[3481.28 → 3482.28] Prayers matters a lot.
[3482.28 → 3484.60] And again, please pray for our leadership.
[3485.46 → 3486.40] Pray for our partners.
[3486.82 → 3489.02] And pray for our participants.
[3489.68 → 3495.98] For God to continue supporting this wonderful ministry that your church has been supporting for years.
[3496.22 → 3496.72] God bless you.
[3496.72 → 3503.96] Thank you, Chatty.
[3504.40 → 3509.62] So we're going to continue our worship by giving of our financial blessings that God has given to us.
[3509.70 → 3514.56] So this morning it is for World Renew and the work that they do all over the world.
[3515.10 → 3519.08] In addition, donations can be made to the ministry of this church.
[3519.08 → 3523.04] So just to clarify, there's going to be some bags and baskets going around.
[3523.48 → 3528.08] And any donations thrown in there that are undesignated will for sure go to World Renew.
[3528.16 → 3531.40] Or you can jump onto the World Renew website and also donate to them directly.
[3531.96 → 3538.32] And if you need to give directly to the budget or any other special ministry, make sure that is designated as such.
[3538.44 → 3542.84] There should be little envelopes in the seats in front of you if you want to do it that way.
[3543.44 → 3545.62] And thank you so much for giving this morning.
[3549.08 → 3579.06] Thank you.
[3579.08 → 3581.08] Thank you.
[3581.08 → 3582.08] Thank you.
[3582.08 → 3584.08] Thank you.
[3584.08 → 3587.08] Thank you.
[3587.08 → 3589.08] Thank you.
[3614.08 → 3617.08] Thank you.
[3617.08 → 3619.08] Thanks.
[3619.08 → 3629.08] Thank you.
[3629.08 → 3631.08] Thank you.
[3631.08 → 3661.06] Thank you.
[3661.08 → 3691.06] Thank you.
[3691.08 → 3721.06] Thank you.
[3721.06 → 3723.06] Thank you.
[3723.06 → 3725.06] Thank you.
[3725.06 → 3727.06] Thank you.
[3755.06 → 3757.06] Thank you.
[3757.06 → 3759.06] Hank the Hound.
[3759.06 → 3761.06] Hank the Hound went in.
[3761.06 → 3765.06] He thought he'd try what bears do, and he hibernated for the winter for the summer months.
[3765.06 → 3767.06] He got it a little bit backwards.
[3767.06 → 3769.76] He's waking up this week, and he's going to come out next week.
[3769.92 → 3771.02] Does that sound like a good idea?
[3771.18 → 3772.94] And he would love to see you all.
[3773.44 → 3777.38] So he's going to come next week, but this week we're going to go and have children's
[3777.38 → 3778.04] worship time in the back.
[3778.08 → 3778.50] Is that good?
[3778.50 → 3780.50] So I'm going to pray.
[3780.50 → 3785.94] And then the seven of you are going to need to do the children's blessing together.
[3785.94 → 3786.28] Okay.
[3786.28 → 3787.18] With everybody here.
[3787.24 → 3787.64] Can we do that?
[3787.68 → 3788.68] We'll teach them how to do that.
[3788.68 → 3790.58] I think all the youths we can teach them.
[3790.62 → 3791.18] Does that sound good?
[3791.84 → 3792.32] All right.
[3792.32 → 3792.80] Let's pray.
[3793.08 → 3793.28] Okay.
[3793.28 → 3794.02] Hold our hands.
[3794.10 → 3794.60] Close our eyes.
[3794.68 → 3795.08] Here we go.
[3795.40 → 3797.10] Dear God, we thank you so much for this day.
[3797.40 → 3801.36] Thank you so much that we could be here this weekend, that we could learn about you.
[3801.42 → 3806.32] And we pray that as these kids go to children's worship time and as the youth and the grown
[3806.32 → 3810.16] up stay back here and listen to Pastor Dave, that all of us, no matter what room we're
[3810.16 → 3813.48] in, we'll learn more about what it means to follow you.
[3813.84 → 3815.04] So we pray this in your name.
[3815.54 → 3815.86] Amen.
[3816.76 → 3820.06] All right, kids, we're going to stand up, and we're going to face the congregation.
[3820.18 → 3821.54] There's a lot of them and the lights are a little crazy.
[3821.54 → 3824.98] And then the church is going to stand up, reactivate you too.
[3825.48 → 3828.98] And the kids on the count of three, they're going to say, the Lord be with you.
[3829.20 → 3831.54] And then you'll respond by saying, and also with you.
[3831.60 → 3832.02] Are we ready?
[3832.38 → 3833.68] Kids, we're going to have to be really loud.
[3833.76 → 3834.70] Are we ready to be loud?
[3835.04 → 3836.34] On the count of three, we're going to say it.
[3836.34 → 3836.56] You ready?
[3836.72 → 3838.14] One, two, three.
[3842.46 → 3844.48] All right, you guys can go off to children's worship time.
[3845.02 → 3847.92] And I'm going to invite up an elder from Langley Manual.
[3847.92 → 3851.56] So Eric's going to come forward and lead us in our family prayer today.
[3851.56 → 3855.46] Hi.
[3865.00 → 3865.44] Hi.
[3865.52 → 3868.84] As mentioned, I'm Eric here at Emanuel, elder here at Emanuel.
[3869.10 → 3871.58] I will lead you in our church family prayer in a moment here.
[3871.58 → 3880.40] Just one quick prayer note before, just a reminder to the congregation that September 16th, we have our, what are we calling it?
[3880.46 → 3880.64] Sorry.
[3881.14 → 3889.54] The special general meeting to consider the call of Kevin for a pastor here at Emanuel.
[3889.54 → 3901.40] And we just wanted to bring it to your attention that, again, that is on the 16th, but that the council wanted to make it clear that if you're unable to attend, that email ballots will be accepted.
[3901.84 → 3905.06] And just touch base with the office for more information on that.
[3905.96 → 3907.58] But let's turn to our Lord in prayer.
[3907.58 → 3918.74] Lord, you are our rock and our salvation, our fortress and our deliverer.
[3919.10 → 3924.18] We thank you for being our stronghold and refuge.
[3925.16 → 3930.18] We thank you as a church that we can freely come to you and worship and praise your name.
[3930.18 → 3939.62] What an incredible opportunity it is for the youth here today, for gathering of the youth from around the province to be here today.
[3940.50 → 3949.82] To reactivate the youth conference, we pray for the stirred hearts, renewed faith and ignited passions for Jesus in a fresh way.
[3950.98 → 3954.96] We also pray for their travelling mercies as they do head home later today as well, Lord.
[3954.96 → 3963.86] Lord, this week, Rachel Malawi's grandmother, Margaret South, passed away this week.
[3964.82 → 3968.92] We pray that you continue to be with the family as they grieve the loss of the loved one.
[3970.50 → 3981.66] Lord, this is the time of year when elementary, middle and high school and even university students are now getting into the regular grind of being in school, Lord.
[3981.66 → 3984.94] Be with those who are feeling stressed or overwhelmed by this, Lord.
[3985.02 → 3990.76] We just ask that you be with the students and teachers and bless them in their journey here.
[3993.00 → 3999.16] As mentioned earlier, Lord, we also have our special meeting coming up this September 3rd, 16th, sorry, for Kevin.
[3999.76 → 4004.26] We pray that the congregation can come together and do your will, Lord.
[4004.26 → 4007.40] Yes, Lord.
[4009.40 → 4014.14] May we also bless you as you go through our week and be grounded and rooted in your word.
[4014.62 → 4015.74] In Jesus' name we pray.
[4016.18 → 4016.44] Amen.
[4016.44 → 4035.84] I think that has to be the tallest elder I have ever met in any church.
[4035.92 → 4036.70] Look at this stand.
[4038.66 → 4040.12] Thank you for that prayer, Eric.
[4040.12 → 4050.08] Well, we learned two things from Hans and Franz, Hans and Evans, and that is number one, you're supposed to eat your peppermints now, so you pass those around.
[4051.10 → 4055.42] Secondly, I get 45 minutes, that's what they said, so buckle up.
[4056.70 → 4064.54] Now, this weekend we've been opening up what it means to be formed in the way of Jesus and the way in which Christ seeks to make us like himself.
[4064.54 → 4068.54] On Friday night, we opened up this invitation from Christ to be with him.
[4068.54 → 4075.12] Last night, we looked at the invitation to become like him, and today we're going to look at what it means to do the things that Jesus did.
[4075.94 → 4079.08] And for that, we're going to read a passage in Mark chapter 3.
[4079.26 → 4082.16] So if you can join me, if you've got your Bible, I think it'll also be on the screen.
[4083.96 → 4085.26] And it feels very strange.
[4085.36 → 4090.76] I see you out in the foyer looking over there at a screen, and we just want to say welcome to sitting in the foyer.
[4090.94 → 4091.84] I see you over there.
[4093.56 → 4097.16] This is God's word from Mark chapter 3 of Jesus appointing the 12.
[4098.54 → 4103.60] Jesus went up on the mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him.
[4104.34 → 4111.48] He appointed 12 that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach and have authority to drive out demons.
[4112.24 → 4113.72] These are the 12 he appointed.
[4114.40 → 4116.26] Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter.
[4117.04 → 4119.20] James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
[4119.56 → 4122.66] To them, he gave the names Boanerges, which means sons of thunder.
[4122.66 → 4133.26] Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James, son of Alpheus, Thaddeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
[4133.76 → 4135.04] This is God's word.
[4135.04 → 4147.78] Well, when I was a teenager in youth group, there was a very common bracelet that almost every Christian teen who went to any Christian conference got,
[4148.16 → 4151.18] and you will probably recognize it if you are my millennial peer.
[4153.14 → 4155.74] WWJD, and just yell out what that stands for if you know.
[4156.46 → 4156.94] Yeah.
[4157.60 → 4158.42] You know this.
[4158.44 → 4159.82] It must not just be my generation.
[4159.82 → 4165.14] I remember going to a conference, and I had one, and you're supposed to wear it, and the idea, and I like this idea,
[4165.24 → 4169.74] is that through your ordinary life as you're doing your things, you sort of see your bracelet,
[4169.88 → 4175.54] and you're reminded to ask, what would Jesus do in this circumstance, with this relationship, with these challenges?
[4175.70 → 4176.40] Would he do that?
[4176.48 → 4177.52] Would he be like this?
[4178.04 → 4183.24] And the only time I really remember noticing it, if I'm honest, is when I was speeding on the highway,
[4183.50 → 4188.42] and I'd have my hand on the steering wheel and be thinking, would Jesus drive this fast?
[4188.42 → 4190.40] But it was effective.
[4191.86 → 4196.10] A very well-known writer named Dallas Willard, he gives his own take on this.
[4196.16 → 4205.02] He says, the most important question that Christians can ask is what kind of life would Jesus live if Jesus lived my life?
[4205.44 → 4210.24] Now, that doesn't fit on a bracelet as nicely, but it does open up the character formation and discipleship.
[4210.24 → 4220.70] What I like about the WWJD bracelet is it's built on the assumption that it is, in fact, possible to do what Jesus does.
[4221.60 → 4225.62] It is, in fact, possible for disciples like you and me, ordinary believers,
[4225.62 → 4231.78] to follow the path that Jesus left for us in his own ministry on how we are to live.
[4233.54 → 4239.54] When Jesus calls you and me by his grace, lovingly and graciously to follow him,
[4239.96 → 4246.96] he invites us not just to be with him, not just to become like him, but to do the very things that he did.
[4246.96 → 4251.64] I want to give an illustration that comes from apprenticeship.
[4252.24 → 4254.12] And maybe some of you remember going to trade school.
[4254.82 → 4257.88] And in my case, my dad was in the trades doing woodworking.
[4258.32 → 4262.08] And anyone who learns woodworking, you'll have a shop teacher who shows you all the tools.
[4262.22 → 4266.32] He shows you how you are to see this work and what a meter saw is.
[4266.38 → 4267.96] He holds before you the piece of wood.
[4268.22 → 4272.16] And the goal is always, in the end, that you take the two-by-four.
[4272.16 → 4276.10] You learn how to cut that piece, and you frame the house, right?
[4276.72 → 4279.62] And I feel like that's a very apt illustration as I look at the plastic
[4279.62 → 4282.02] and the renovation work that needs to be done in this building.
[4282.38 → 4286.72] The goal is for you to be able to do what your teacher shows you to do.
[4288.14 → 4289.96] Do you see discipleship this way?
[4291.22 → 4293.76] I think, and maybe this checks out with you, maybe it doesn't,
[4293.86 → 4298.58] that so often when we read the Gospels, we read the stories of Jesus' ministry,
[4298.92 → 4300.88] his discipleship, the teaching that he does,
[4300.88 → 4305.80] we often see it as only showing us how Jesus does things,
[4305.94 → 4307.12] his ministry, his way.
[4307.18 → 4309.08] And of course that's true, but we never started to see,
[4309.48 → 4311.86] could it be that this is the way that I'm supposed to follow?
[4312.50 → 4316.82] Is this the ministry that I'm supposed to participate in with my life here today?
[4319.72 → 4323.66] The Jesus who lays down his life to defeat sin, death, and Satan
[4323.66 → 4326.64] is the same Jesus who ascends to be with the Father
[4326.64 → 4330.58] and then sends his Spirit so that you and I can, in our own ordinary ways,
[4330.88 → 4333.70] do the things that Jesus did.
[4334.30 → 4339.14] At the very outset of Mark's Gospel, already in Mark chapter 1, which we looked at last night,
[4339.92 → 4340.98] Jesus says to his disciples,
[4341.14 → 4346.06] I want you to follow me, and I'm going to send you out to fish for people,
[4346.14 → 4347.28] to be fishers of men.
[4347.84 → 4352.32] And it's very evident that this thing of discipleship is not some passive watching of Jesus
[4352.32 → 4356.44] where you sort of watch him do something, or you watch just the way he's going to live.
[4356.44 → 4361.54] You're invited to participate in the work that Jesus is beginning in his kingdom ministry
[4361.54 → 4364.90] as he fills us with his strength and sends us out.
[4366.70 → 4371.30] So often I think we fall prey to that trap, whether it's sort of in the way we think
[4371.30 → 4374.66] or even just the way we act where we see discipleship as watching Jesus
[4374.66 → 4378.70] or maybe even this, watching other people do the discipleship
[4378.70 → 4381.58] and sort of stepping back and being an observer.
[4382.36 → 4384.80] When it doesn't matter how old or young you are,
[4384.88 → 4387.46] when Jesus says, follow me to each one of us,
[4387.92 → 4393.52] he invites us to actively participate, to play our part in his kingdom ministry.
[4394.82 → 4398.40] And now I want to reread our passage, at least the first part of it.
[4399.20 → 4400.10] In Mark chapter 3,
[4400.10 → 4417.98] And then we have this long list of names of the disciples who followed Jesus.
[4418.08 → 4421.86] And I want you to know that this is a really mixed motley crew.
[4422.12 → 4426.10] You have a trader, a fiery zealot, some fisherman, a Roman collaborator,
[4426.10 → 4430.16] and James and John who get the most amazing nicknames in the Bible.
[4430.66 → 4431.28] Look at that.
[4431.64 → 4433.94] Boanerges, which means sons of thunder.
[4434.78 → 4436.00] Is that not an amazing nickname?
[4436.06 → 4439.28] For those who are expecting children, just to put that on the radar,
[4439.72 → 4441.60] Boanerges is yours for the taking.
[4442.66 → 4445.14] I think one of the first tasks is just getting along
[4445.14 → 4447.34] because they are such a diverse motley crew
[4447.34 → 4449.88] and they had to sort out how to be in community with one another
[4449.88 → 4451.40] with such different backgrounds.
[4452.42 → 4454.94] But what you need to know at the very outside this passage
[4454.94 → 4456.56] is it's on a mountainside.
[4457.30 → 4459.68] And just a heads-up, whenever Jesus heads on a mountain
[4459.68 → 4461.86] and He meets with people on a mountain,
[4462.02 → 4463.98] it's always a very important gathering.
[4464.08 → 4465.48] It's always a very important event.
[4465.58 → 4468.82] That's often calling back to Old Testament events.
[4468.90 → 4472.22] And in this case, the Old Testament event that we're calling back to
[4472.22 → 4475.18] is God calling Moses in the book of Exodus.
[4475.50 → 4477.44] He brings Moses to a mountaintop
[4477.44 → 4478.58] and He's going to say to Moses,
[4478.58 → 4481.52] I'm pulling this people Israel into my mission
[4481.52 → 4484.16] to let the nations know that I am the living God.
[4484.16 → 4487.32] And in this case, we now have Jesus, the Son of the living God,
[4487.68 → 4490.52] pulling in these 12 disciples, the new Israel,
[4490.72 → 4492.82] and saying, I am now gathering you
[4492.82 → 4494.56] and sending you out to the nations
[4494.56 → 4498.32] to make known that I am the Saviour of creation.
[4499.52 → 4501.08] Mountaintop experience.
[4501.08 → 4505.52] From the beginning to the end of Scripture,
[4506.54 → 4509.88] God graciously, and I would say remarkably,
[4510.44 → 4513.18] invites ordinary humans like these disciples,
[4513.46 → 4515.02] like you and me, into His plan.
[4515.10 → 4516.20] He doesn't have to do that.
[4516.86 → 4519.66] God could, if He wanted, accomplish all that He wants
[4519.66 → 4521.28] without any human involvement,
[4521.48 → 4522.54] and yet He graciously says,
[4522.92 → 4526.44] I want my people to be part of my plan.
[4526.44 → 4528.96] I will remarkably work through,
[4529.20 → 4532.52] in and through these ordinary, broken people
[4532.52 → 4534.16] who don't think they have much to give
[4534.16 → 4535.94] to make my name known.
[4536.60 → 4540.28] He uses fishermen, tax collectors,
[4541.08 → 4542.20] Roman collaborators.
[4542.82 → 4548.34] He uses doctors, framers, parents, students,
[4548.56 → 4550.76] children, accountants, farmers, teachers,
[4550.94 → 4554.18] on and on we go to make Himself known.
[4554.18 → 4557.46] I want to read Matthew's version
[4557.46 → 4559.96] of this same account of the calling
[4559.96 → 4561.12] of His first disciples.
[4561.36 → 4563.28] And this comes from Matthew 10, verse 5,
[4563.36 → 4565.28] and I'm intrigued by the different way
[4565.28 → 4565.94] that He says it.
[4566.00 → 4567.24] He says, as you go,
[4567.60 → 4569.18] sort of implying the ordinary world
[4569.18 → 4569.86] that you're going to live in,
[4569.92 → 4570.94] proclaim this message.
[4571.30 → 4573.04] The kingdom of heaven has come near,
[4573.78 → 4576.52] so heal the sick, raise the dead,
[4577.14 → 4578.52] cleanse those who have leprosy,
[4578.62 → 4579.56] drive out demons,
[4580.00 → 4581.74] freely you have received,
[4582.50 → 4583.18] freely give.
[4584.18 → 4586.90] And I can almost hear the disciples
[4586.90 → 4587.78] saying to each other
[4587.78 → 4589.04] after Jesus says these words,
[4589.20 → 4590.00] like, us?
[4590.96 → 4591.40] Us?
[4591.74 → 4593.20] Heal the sick, raise the dead,
[4593.36 → 4594.10] cleanse the lepers?
[4594.44 → 4596.36] You're asking us to do these things?
[4596.92 → 4598.62] I can imagine the nerves,
[4599.08 → 4600.90] the wondering if they're in the right meeting
[4600.90 → 4601.96] with the right person
[4601.96 → 4603.14] to do the right things.
[4603.68 → 4604.76] And yet Jesus says to them,
[4604.86 → 4605.98] freely you have received.
[4607.00 → 4608.84] You have been brought into the life
[4608.84 → 4609.64] of the kingdom of God.
[4609.70 → 4611.32] You have received the grace
[4611.32 → 4612.44] that is going to change your life,
[4612.44 → 4613.96] and now you get to freely give it.
[4614.28 → 4615.32] You get to freely share
[4615.32 → 4616.28] the grace of Jesus,
[4616.62 → 4617.50] the power of Jesus,
[4617.60 → 4618.52] and the life of Jesus
[4618.52 → 4620.60] to everyone around you.
[4623.38 → 4624.40] When I was reading about
[4624.40 → 4625.56] this calling of the disciples,
[4626.38 → 4627.78] a writer that I very much like
[4627.78 → 4629.32] says that for all of them,
[4630.20 → 4631.84] their learning process
[4631.84 → 4633.78] of how to do what Jesus did
[4633.78 → 4636.50] was slow and steady.
[4636.50 → 4638.56] It often started with them
[4638.56 → 4640.06] just holding a basket
[4640.06 → 4642.12] while Jesus fed the 5,000.
[4642.20 → 4643.72] Their job was just to hold this basket
[4643.72 → 4644.60] and distribute it.
[4645.06 → 4646.38] Then they go to meals with Jesus
[4646.38 → 4647.60] and they see Him arguing
[4647.60 → 4648.58] and dealing with people
[4648.58 → 4649.76] who really don't like Him,
[4650.16 → 4651.04] learning how to interact
[4651.04 → 4651.92] with religious leaders
[4651.92 → 4653.20] that are trying to trap Him.
[4653.74 → 4655.96] They watch Jesus live with the poor
[4655.96 → 4657.00] and show His affection
[4657.00 → 4658.16] and care for the vulnerable.
[4658.64 → 4660.24] They see Jesus do all these things
[4660.24 → 4660.92] and slowly,
[4661.96 → 4663.04] in the Gospels already,
[4663.20 → 4664.96] and especially in the book of Acts
[4664.96 → 4665.98] when they receive the Spirit,
[4666.84 → 4668.84] they slowly learn how to do it too.
[4669.70 → 4671.04] Open up their homes
[4671.04 → 4672.68] and have meals with those
[4672.68 → 4673.50] who disagree with them.
[4673.60 → 4674.42] Learn how to reconcile
[4674.42 → 4675.42] with their enemies.
[4675.80 → 4676.82] Learn how to build community
[4676.82 → 4678.20] between Jews and Gentiles
[4678.20 → 4679.36] who do not like each other.
[4679.74 → 4681.22] Learn how to love their neighbours.
[4682.22 → 4683.58] Learn how to pray for the sick.
[4684.24 → 4685.28] Learn how to give away
[4685.28 → 4686.36] all that they've been given
[4686.36 → 4687.42] for the sake of the kingdom.
[4688.30 → 4690.26] Slowly but surely,
[4690.84 → 4692.36] they stepped out
[4692.36 → 4693.62] into the kingdom ministry
[4693.62 → 4695.06] that Jesus sends them into.
[4696.06 → 4696.86] And I'm going to come back
[4696.86 → 4698.26] to that for us today too.
[4698.60 → 4699.54] But let me just pause
[4699.54 → 4700.16] and say this.
[4700.82 → 4701.96] You probably have experienced
[4701.96 → 4702.68] these moments
[4702.68 → 4704.50] where you feel nervous,
[4704.92 → 4706.22] you are not feeling equipped,
[4706.34 → 4706.82] you don't feel like
[4706.82 → 4707.50] you're the right person
[4707.50 → 4708.02] for the job,
[4708.08 → 4709.58] and you step out in faith
[4709.58 → 4711.90] and you find that Jesus meets you
[4711.90 → 4713.36] and He shows up
[4713.36 → 4715.08] and He does His work through you.
[4717.20 → 4718.38] I'm going to name a question
[4718.38 → 4719.40] that's maybe percolating
[4719.40 → 4719.94] in your mind
[4719.94 → 4721.68] as you read Mark chapter 3.
[4721.68 → 4722.48] And the question is,
[4723.22 → 4724.40] you're saying to me
[4724.40 → 4725.68] that following Jesus
[4725.68 → 4726.62] in this passage
[4726.62 → 4727.84] is preaching
[4727.84 → 4729.78] and it's casting out demons.
[4730.66 → 4731.40] I'm not doing
[4731.40 → 4732.12] either of those things.
[4732.20 → 4733.22] I'm not Pastor Chris
[4733.22 → 4734.06] on Sunday morning
[4734.06 → 4735.46] and I'm certainly not
[4735.46 → 4736.18] casting out demons
[4736.18 → 4737.06] right now in my life.
[4737.16 → 4738.08] Am I a disciple?
[4738.84 → 4739.62] Maybe you're not asking that,
[4739.66 → 4739.94] maybe you are.
[4739.98 → 4741.06] Let me just name for you
[4741.06 → 4741.82] two things
[4741.82 → 4742.56] that are helpful to hear.
[4742.66 → 4743.14] Number one,
[4743.22 → 4744.72] this is not an exhaustive list
[4744.72 → 4745.32] of the calling
[4745.32 → 4745.92] of the disciples.
[4746.42 → 4747.50] This is one part
[4747.50 → 4748.20] of their calling
[4748.20 → 4749.44] as they follow Jesus.
[4749.44 → 4750.78] Number two,
[4751.94 → 4753.76] if I'm hearing the gifts
[4753.76 → 4754.72] in the other parts
[4754.72 → 4755.28] of the New Testament,
[4755.44 → 4756.54] especially the gifts
[4756.54 → 4757.02] of the body
[4757.02 → 4758.06] in 1 Corinthians 12,
[4758.96 → 4759.82] Jesus knows
[4759.82 → 4760.82] that not all of us
[4760.82 → 4761.18] are called
[4761.18 → 4762.66] to the exact same things
[4762.66 → 4763.62] in the church of Jesus.
[4764.16 → 4765.24] And He generously gives
[4765.24 → 4766.06] many different gifts
[4766.06 → 4767.06] to many different people.
[4767.16 → 4767.62] And by the way,
[4767.82 → 4768.90] I saw those gifts
[4768.90 → 4769.52] on display
[4769.52 → 4770.62] throughout Reactivate
[4770.62 → 4771.12] this weekend
[4771.12 → 4772.60] with the serving of food,
[4772.70 → 4773.68] the playing of music,
[4773.94 → 4775.36] the leading of conversations,
[4775.58 → 4776.50] going out in creation,
[4776.82 → 4777.70] so many gifts
[4777.70 → 4779.16] used in so many different ways.
[4779.44 → 4780.68] But in all of them,
[4781.14 → 4782.12] there is that calling
[4782.12 → 4783.86] to use what you've been given,
[4784.50 → 4786.16] to step out in faith
[4786.16 → 4787.62] so that Jesus Christ
[4787.62 → 4788.98] is glorified and honoured.
[4789.66 → 4791.10] And every one of us,
[4791.52 → 4792.36] whether you feel equipped
[4792.36 → 4793.92] to be an evangelist or not,
[4794.34 → 4795.92] are called to make Jesus known
[4795.92 → 4796.82] with your words
[4796.82 → 4798.78] and your deeds,
[4799.46 → 4800.22] to give a reason
[4800.22 → 4801.30] for the hope that you have
[4801.30 → 4802.04] with your coworkers
[4802.04 → 4802.90] and classmates
[4802.90 → 4804.02] so that Jesus
[4804.02 → 4805.10] would be made known
[4805.10 → 4806.20] through you.
[4806.20 → 4811.38] I'm going to make
[4811.38 → 4813.14] three concluding reflections today.
[4813.52 → 4813.88] That's right,
[4813.92 → 4815.20] I'm not going for 45 minutes,
[4815.62 → 4816.54] but I'm not done yet.
[4817.54 → 4818.64] The first one
[4818.64 → 4820.28] is so essential
[4820.28 → 4820.94] for us to hear
[4820.94 → 4822.06] no matter what stage
[4822.06 → 4822.60] we are at
[4822.60 → 4823.46] in our discipleship
[4823.46 → 4823.88] with Jesus,
[4824.54 → 4825.98] that your invitation
[4825.98 → 4826.56] from Jesus
[4826.56 → 4827.60] is not passive,
[4828.40 → 4829.46] that we are not called
[4829.46 → 4830.12] to sort of sit
[4830.12 → 4830.92] in the back seat
[4830.92 → 4832.12] and watch other people
[4832.12 → 4833.72] do the ministry of Christ
[4833.72 → 4834.70] without you.
[4835.38 → 4836.88] Every one of us,
[4837.08 → 4837.74] from the oldest
[4837.74 → 4838.42] to the youngest,
[4838.70 → 4840.10] from the most competent feeling
[4840.10 → 4841.00] to the weakest feeling,
[4841.20 → 4842.24] is invited to serve
[4842.24 → 4842.92] with everything
[4842.92 → 4843.66] we've been given
[4843.66 → 4845.40] to make Jesus known.
[4846.08 → 4848.04] There is no far back seat
[4848.04 → 4848.94] where you just passively
[4848.94 → 4849.64] watch Jesus
[4849.64 → 4851.22] or watch other Christians
[4851.22 → 4852.46] do the work of ministry.
[4852.66 → 4853.36] It's for each
[4853.36 → 4854.06] and every one of you
[4854.06 → 4856.64] exactly where you already live,
[4857.26 → 4859.02] exactly where you already work,
[4859.18 → 4860.86] exactly where you already worship.
[4861.28 → 4862.34] This is the place
[4862.34 → 4864.24] where Jesus sends you out.
[4867.66 → 4868.80] One of the commentators
[4868.80 → 4869.52] on this passage
[4869.52 → 4870.00] noticed
[4870.00 → 4871.98] that as these disciples
[4871.98 → 4872.70] worked out
[4872.70 → 4873.34] in their own lives
[4873.34 → 4874.30] how to follow Jesus,
[4874.84 → 4876.46] they regularly found out
[4876.46 → 4878.10] that the kingdom of God
[4878.10 → 4879.08] had come to stay.
[4879.94 → 4880.96] I want you to imagine
[4880.96 → 4881.92] the fears
[4881.92 → 4882.68] they might have had
[4882.68 → 4883.72] as ordinary fishermen
[4883.72 → 4884.58] going to preach,
[4884.70 → 4885.64] going to cast out demons,
[4885.80 → 4886.34] going to heal,
[4886.46 → 4887.62] going to do all the stuff
[4887.62 → 4889.14] that Jesus invited them to do,
[4889.18 → 4890.24] all the fears they had,
[4890.46 → 4891.48] and they would have found out
[4891.48 → 4893.94] over and over and over again
[4893.94 → 4895.64] that the kingdom of God
[4895.64 → 4896.58] that they witnessed
[4896.58 → 4897.64] in the life of Jesus
[4897.64 → 4899.14] was showing up
[4899.14 → 4900.08] in their lives.
[4901.52 → 4902.62] Sometimes we can read
[4902.62 → 4903.52] the gospel accounts
[4903.52 → 4903.86] and think,
[4904.00 → 4905.32] wow, Jesus did this healing.
[4905.44 → 4906.26] He calmed the storm.
[4906.36 → 4907.06] He raised his girl
[4907.06 → 4907.58] from the dead.
[4907.80 → 4908.94] And then when Jesus dies
[4908.94 → 4909.46] and rises,
[4909.62 → 4910.36] well, that's kind of
[4910.36 → 4910.96] the end of it.
[4911.52 → 4912.80] That is the opposite
[4912.80 → 4914.56] of why Jesus came.
[4915.02 → 4915.66] In his death,
[4915.74 → 4916.80] he deals with sin.
[4916.94 → 4917.90] He deals with Satan.
[4918.02 → 4919.38] He deals with death itself.
[4919.38 → 4920.70] And in his resurrection,
[4920.86 → 4921.18] he says,
[4921.46 → 4923.52] this kingdom is here to stay.
[4924.10 → 4924.92] And the book of Acts
[4924.92 → 4926.10] is a story that says
[4926.10 → 4927.78] the life that Jesus had
[4927.78 → 4929.70] poured out on the church
[4929.70 → 4930.70] so that the church
[4930.70 → 4932.30] can continue to do
[4932.30 → 4934.02] what Jesus did.
[4934.40 → 4935.60] And that includes you
[4935.60 → 4937.06] and me here this morning.
[4938.82 → 4939.38] Secondly,
[4939.94 → 4941.84] you and I have
[4941.84 → 4942.62] the authority
[4942.62 → 4943.58] and the power.
[4944.42 → 4945.64] I don't think we talk
[4945.64 → 4946.52] enough about this.
[4947.02 → 4947.62] That yes,
[4947.62 → 4948.56] yes, we are weak.
[4948.98 → 4949.98] Yes, we have sin.
[4950.10 → 4951.44] Yes, we feel ill-equipped.
[4951.70 → 4953.02] But the power of Jesus
[4953.02 → 4954.66] is sufficient for you.
[4955.78 → 4956.90] It is sufficient
[4956.90 → 4958.30] for you in your workplace.
[4958.80 → 4959.70] It's sufficient for you
[4959.70 → 4960.22] in your school.
[4960.50 → 4961.60] It is sufficient for you
[4961.60 → 4962.50] to do the work
[4962.50 → 4964.56] that Jesus sends you to do.
[4965.60 → 4966.96] We've all heard this passage
[4966.96 → 4967.92] in the book of Ephesians,
[4968.02 → 4968.60] but it says that
[4968.60 → 4969.36] the same power
[4969.36 → 4970.54] that rose Jesus Christ
[4970.54 → 4971.02] from the dead
[4971.02 → 4972.40] is alive in
[4972.40 → 4974.10] us
[4974.10 → 4975.08] also.
[4975.08 → 4976.94] the same spirit
[4976.94 → 4978.38] is alive in us
[4978.38 → 4978.84] and that means
[4978.84 → 4979.82] new things are possible.
[4980.54 → 4981.22] New opportunities
[4981.22 → 4981.98] are available.
[4982.14 → 4982.88] New transformation
[4982.88 → 4984.78] is on tap
[4984.78 → 4985.72] for us to experience.
[4986.96 → 4987.66] And I want you to know
[4987.66 → 4988.58] that there are
[4988.58 → 4989.14] a few things
[4989.14 → 4990.10] more satisfying
[4990.10 → 4991.88] than stepping out
[4991.88 → 4992.24] in faith,
[4992.34 → 4993.14] whatever that looks like,
[4993.22 → 4993.86] sharing your faith
[4993.86 → 4994.62] with a classmate,
[4995.06 → 4995.84] encouraging someone,
[4995.98 → 4996.62] praying for someone
[4996.62 → 4997.06] who's sick,
[4997.16 → 4998.58] and seeing Jesus
[4998.58 → 4999.30] do His work
[4999.30 → 4999.84] through you.
[5000.66 → 5001.34] I can say that
[5001.34 → 5002.20] when I was a youth pastor
[5002.20 → 5003.52] and I will say
[5003.52 → 5004.20] that in youth ministry
[5004.20 → 5004.90] there's a lot of
[5004.90 → 5005.84] exciting nights
[5005.84 → 5006.34] and there's a lot
[5006.34 → 5007.06] of quiet nights
[5007.06 → 5007.74] where you just don't know
[5007.74 → 5008.70] if anyone's listening,
[5008.88 → 5009.64] if anyone cares,
[5010.02 → 5010.98] if the grade 12 students
[5010.98 → 5012.10] really want to follow Jesus,
[5012.48 → 5013.32] and then you'll find out
[5013.32 → 5014.60] five, ten years later
[5014.60 → 5015.64] that that conversation
[5015.64 → 5016.60] changed their lives.
[5017.38 → 5018.16] Conversation that you thought
[5018.16 → 5019.20] was just so ordinary
[5019.20 → 5020.26] where you shared
[5020.26 → 5021.40] about your own vulnerabilities,
[5021.66 → 5022.50] your own story,
[5022.70 → 5024.32] and Jesus in His grace
[5024.32 → 5025.10] and His power
[5025.10 → 5026.02] and His authority
[5026.02 → 5027.42] uses you
[5027.42 → 5029.56] to disciple that person,
[5029.70 → 5030.58] uses you
[5030.58 → 5031.56] to enable them
[5031.56 → 5032.16] to see the goodness
[5032.16 → 5032.60] of Jesus,
[5032.76 → 5033.56] uses you
[5033.56 → 5034.58] to help your co-worker
[5034.58 → 5035.40] see there's a different
[5035.40 → 5036.38] reason to live
[5036.38 → 5037.92] than for themselves.
[5038.84 → 5040.20] Can you imagine that
[5040.20 → 5041.68] for your life
[5041.68 → 5043.36] at the stage you're in
[5043.36 → 5044.24] right now?
[5047.54 → 5048.84] And if you feel inadequate,
[5049.56 → 5050.46] so do the disciples.
[5050.90 → 5051.18] In fact,
[5051.22 → 5052.04] if you feel weak
[5052.04 → 5052.68] and powerless
[5052.68 → 5053.42] and like you don't have
[5053.42 → 5054.42] a lot to offer Jesus,
[5054.76 → 5056.04] you join the whole host
[5056.04 → 5056.84] of church history
[5056.84 → 5058.42] right back to the ones
[5058.42 → 5059.68] He called on the mountainside.
[5059.68 → 5060.98] I don't think anyone
[5060.98 → 5062.40] steps into the ministry
[5062.40 → 5062.84] of Jesus
[5062.84 → 5063.44] and feels like,
[5063.82 → 5064.52] I got this.
[5064.92 → 5066.14] Everyone steps into it
[5066.14 → 5066.36] saying,
[5066.70 → 5066.86] me?
[5067.56 → 5068.08] Me too?
[5068.44 → 5069.38] You're calling me
[5069.38 → 5070.24] into this ministry
[5070.24 → 5071.48] of making Jesus known
[5071.48 → 5072.52] and showing His love
[5072.52 → 5073.56] through all the ways I live?
[5073.90 → 5074.52] Yes, you.
[5075.24 → 5075.68] And yes,
[5075.72 → 5076.14] He'll meet you
[5076.14 → 5076.64] in your weakness.
[5077.98 → 5078.92] You are empowered.
[5079.60 → 5080.52] You have His authority
[5080.52 → 5081.84] and you are sent.
[5083.30 → 5084.12] And here's where
[5084.12 → 5084.74] I want to finish.
[5084.92 → 5085.70] Maybe this is a strange
[5085.70 → 5086.26] place to finish,
[5086.40 → 5087.64] but this is what I think
[5087.64 → 5088.60] needed to be shared,
[5088.60 → 5089.90] especially with the students
[5089.90 → 5090.80] here at Reactivate.
[5092.30 → 5093.44] We are invited
[5093.44 → 5095.10] to fail forward,
[5095.96 → 5097.28] to make mistakes.
[5098.08 → 5099.36] Jesus did not expect
[5099.36 → 5100.34] all the twelve
[5100.34 → 5101.40] to get everything right
[5101.40 → 5101.94] the first time.
[5102.02 → 5102.30] In fact,
[5102.80 → 5103.64] this is not recorded
[5103.64 → 5104.22] in the Gospels,
[5104.34 → 5105.34] but there are a few times
[5105.34 → 5107.02] where I imagine Jesus
[5107.02 → 5108.18] just doing a facepalm
[5108.18 → 5109.50] because they are just so far.
[5109.86 → 5111.08] Like one of those situations
[5111.08 → 5111.98] in the Gospel of Luke
[5111.98 → 5112.84] where they're not welcome
[5112.84 → 5113.50] in a city
[5113.50 → 5115.10] and the people
[5115.10 → 5116.12] in the Samaritan village
[5116.12 → 5117.30] did not want Jesus to come
[5117.30 → 5118.84] and the disciples say to Jesus,
[5118.96 → 5119.86] I just love this story.
[5119.94 → 5120.14] They say,
[5120.22 → 5121.24] would you like us to pray
[5121.24 → 5122.46] and call down fire
[5122.46 → 5123.48] to destroy the city?
[5124.06 → 5124.46] And Jesus is like,
[5124.52 → 5124.74] no,
[5125.26 → 5126.54] that is not what I want you to do.
[5126.84 → 5127.70] You're not there yet.
[5127.76 → 5128.42] And the disciples
[5128.42 → 5129.32] had this ability
[5129.32 → 5130.12] to fail forward.
[5130.22 → 5130.78] They just kept
[5130.78 → 5131.72] trying to figure it out.
[5131.96 → 5132.92] They kept making mistakes.
[5133.04 → 5134.36] Jesus' grace met them
[5134.36 → 5135.66] in all of their failures
[5135.66 → 5137.02] and slowly but surely
[5137.02 → 5137.52] they learned
[5137.52 → 5138.32] how to do what He did.
[5138.56 → 5139.84] Always by His strength,
[5140.42 → 5141.52] always by the Spirit,
[5141.90 → 5142.40] they learned
[5142.40 → 5143.00] how to do
[5143.00 → 5144.26] what Jesus did.
[5144.26 → 5146.72] I happen to believe
[5146.72 → 5147.96] that even in this building
[5147.96 → 5148.56] right now,
[5149.08 → 5150.22] there is an unbelievable
[5150.22 → 5151.22] number of gifts,
[5151.94 → 5153.34] many of which
[5153.34 → 5154.62] have not yet been tested
[5154.62 → 5155.20] and tried,
[5155.94 → 5156.86] many of which people
[5156.86 → 5157.68] have sort of denied
[5157.68 → 5158.42] or suppressed
[5158.42 → 5159.22] that that's the way
[5159.22 → 5160.82] Jesus calls them to serve.
[5161.52 → 5162.74] And I think the invitation
[5162.74 → 5164.94] from this passage
[5164.94 → 5166.80] is to be willing
[5166.80 → 5167.80] to take the risks,
[5168.78 → 5169.84] try out the gifts
[5169.84 → 5171.00] that your youth pastor
[5171.00 → 5172.16] or friend or co-worker
[5172.16 → 5173.14] said that you have
[5173.14 → 5173.84] in your life
[5173.84 → 5174.94] and allow Jesus
[5174.94 → 5175.96] to do His thing
[5175.96 → 5176.88] through you.
[5177.40 → 5178.14] Make mistakes.
[5178.36 → 5179.16] I know this church
[5179.16 → 5179.58] well enough
[5179.58 → 5180.64] and I know so many churches
[5180.64 → 5181.16] well enough to know
[5181.16 → 5182.52] that they are safe places
[5182.52 → 5183.16] to fail
[5183.16 → 5184.22] and you will be loved
[5184.22 → 5185.16] if you have been trying
[5185.16 → 5185.92] to serve Jesus
[5185.92 → 5186.70] with the gifts
[5186.70 → 5187.84] you think He's been giving you.
[5189.10 → 5189.94] When's the last time
[5189.94 → 5190.48] you did that?
[5191.76 → 5192.46] When's the last time
[5192.46 → 5193.56] you took that small
[5193.56 → 5194.92] baby step of saying,
[5195.10 → 5195.84] I'm going to pray
[5195.84 → 5196.60] for this person.
[5197.36 → 5198.38] I'm going to give
[5198.38 → 5199.20] where there is need.
[5199.32 → 5200.30] I'm going to get involved
[5200.30 → 5201.36] in this messy situation.
[5201.66 → 5202.56] I'm going to show up
[5202.56 → 5203.06] for the meeting
[5203.06 → 5204.16] and reconcile with someone
[5204.16 → 5205.52] so that Jesus can do
[5205.52 → 5206.34] His work through me.
[5206.42 → 5206.98] I'm going to take
[5206.98 → 5208.20] that baby step forward
[5208.20 → 5209.66] and see what happens
[5209.66 → 5211.02] when the Spirit
[5211.02 → 5211.74] of the living God
[5211.74 → 5213.00] shows up with us.
[5213.72 → 5214.30] Whether that be
[5214.30 → 5216.88] befriending a disabled classmate,
[5217.52 → 5218.18] getting involved
[5218.18 → 5219.16] in refugee sponsorship
[5219.16 → 5220.46] when it's no longer popular,
[5221.16 → 5222.04] learning how to use
[5222.04 → 5222.66] your resources
[5222.66 → 5223.90] and give radically,
[5224.58 → 5225.60] intercessory prayer
[5225.60 → 5226.86] that feels so strange,
[5227.34 → 5228.82] hospitality that feels difficult
[5228.82 → 5229.62] when you're introverted,
[5229.84 → 5232.70] and so many more things.
[5233.06 → 5235.46] you are invited
[5235.46 → 5236.32] to try,
[5236.62 → 5238.02] to experiment,
[5238.58 → 5239.66] and to fail forward.
[5239.80 → 5240.72] Curtis used that language
[5240.72 → 5241.60] wherever Curtis is.
[5241.86 → 5242.64] Curtis Mali does it.
[5242.74 → 5243.94] Talked with the leadership team
[5243.94 → 5244.56] of Reactivate,
[5244.66 → 5245.32] failing forward,
[5245.42 → 5246.20] learning as they go,
[5246.24 → 5247.22] and I like that language.
[5248.32 → 5249.32] And I want to share with you
[5249.32 → 5250.48] a very specific story
[5250.48 → 5250.98] about this
[5250.98 → 5251.98] that will be with me
[5251.98 → 5252.70] for many years.
[5253.58 → 5254.36] It's a story about someone
[5254.36 → 5255.08] who prayed for me.
[5255.86 → 5256.92] When I was at Regent,
[5257.28 → 5259.04] three years in or so,
[5259.66 → 5260.42] I was in a season
[5260.42 → 5261.56] where I was feeling overwhelmed
[5261.56 → 5263.28] by the work I was doing
[5263.28 → 5263.98] as a youth pastor
[5263.98 → 5264.94] as well as studying
[5264.94 → 5265.62] as well as having
[5265.62 → 5266.68] two very young kids
[5266.68 → 5267.52] and sleeplessness.
[5267.96 → 5268.66] And there's a season
[5268.66 → 5269.26] where I felt like
[5269.26 → 5269.98] I wasn't praying
[5269.98 → 5270.58] and I was sort of
[5270.58 → 5271.58] leading out of an emptiness.
[5272.20 → 5273.20] And in that season,
[5273.20 → 5274.50] there was a class at Regent
[5274.50 → 5275.50] that required me
[5275.50 → 5276.66] to go on a prayer retreat.
[5276.86 → 5277.46] And I remember saying
[5277.46 → 5277.90] to my wife,
[5278.02 → 5278.98] I don't have time
[5278.98 → 5280.52] to go on a prayer retreat.
[5280.62 → 5280.94] And she's like,
[5280.98 → 5281.50] that doesn't sound
[5281.50 → 5282.40] like what pastors say.
[5283.22 → 5284.14] So I go on this
[5284.14 → 5285.18] mandatory prayer retreat
[5285.18 → 5286.18] and I'm going on empty.
[5286.32 → 5287.12] It's in Bellingham
[5287.12 → 5287.94] and they start
[5287.94 → 5288.66] on a Friday night.
[5288.74 → 5289.80] There's a worship service.
[5290.34 → 5291.06] Service finishes
[5291.06 → 5291.80] and afterwards,
[5292.00 → 5293.22] the leader of the conference says,
[5293.38 → 5294.38] if anyone wants
[5294.38 → 5295.30] to stick around later
[5295.30 → 5296.16] and receive prayer,
[5296.40 → 5297.00] there's a number
[5297.00 → 5298.30] of intercessory prayers
[5298.30 → 5298.98] who would love
[5298.98 → 5299.68] to pray for you.
[5300.08 → 5300.46] I'm like,
[5300.50 → 5300.98] you know what?
[5301.46 → 5302.26] I'll do that.
[5302.44 → 5303.08] I need prayer.
[5303.24 → 5304.24] I'm not in a good place.
[5304.64 → 5305.48] So I stick around
[5305.48 → 5306.48] and there's a young guy,
[5306.62 → 5307.92] probably in his early 30s.
[5308.34 → 5309.14] He comes over to me.
[5309.20 → 5309.94] I've never met him.
[5310.48 → 5310.86] And he says,
[5310.92 → 5311.74] can I pray for you?
[5312.06 → 5312.68] I said, sure.
[5312.86 → 5313.58] That's why I'm here.
[5314.08 → 5314.58] And he says,
[5314.62 → 5315.40] can I put my hand
[5315.40 → 5315.94] on your chest?
[5315.94 → 5316.18] I'm like,
[5316.24 → 5317.24] what is going on here?
[5318.12 → 5319.12] That's what I remember the most.
[5319.16 → 5319.72] He puts his hand
[5319.72 → 5320.28] on my chest
[5320.28 → 5322.02] and for like five minutes,
[5322.14 → 5322.64] let's say,
[5322.86 → 5323.64] he prays.
[5323.66 → 5324.08] And I don't know
[5324.08 → 5324.44] what he's praying.
[5324.48 → 5325.02] He's kind of praying
[5325.02 → 5326.38] in his own heart,
[5326.64 → 5327.46] just kind of murmuring.
[5328.16 → 5329.00] And after five minutes,
[5329.00 → 5329.38] he says,
[5329.46 → 5330.20] can I share with you
[5330.20 → 5330.64] what I think
[5330.64 → 5331.62] the Spirit is saying?
[5332.20 → 5332.96] I'm like, yeah.
[5333.86 → 5335.34] And he starts to share things
[5335.34 → 5336.24] that there's absolutely
[5336.24 → 5337.84] no way he could know
[5337.84 → 5339.24] unless the Spirit
[5339.24 → 5340.12] was speaking through him.
[5340.22 → 5341.18] And I did not grow up
[5341.18 → 5342.10] in a charismatic tradition
[5342.10 → 5342.98] where people did this,
[5343.26 → 5344.92] but I took a steep learning curve
[5344.92 → 5345.60] right there and then
[5345.60 → 5345.94] where I'm like,
[5346.00 → 5347.62] this guy knows my life.
[5347.70 → 5348.64] He knows how I feel.
[5348.90 → 5350.24] And he's speaking things
[5350.24 → 5351.28] that I feel like Jesus
[5351.28 → 5352.94] is saying directly to me
[5352.94 → 5353.52] through him.
[5354.84 → 5355.58] Now, there's a lot
[5355.58 → 5356.26] of beautiful things
[5356.26 → 5357.30] that came out of my life
[5357.30 → 5357.80] through that,
[5357.90 → 5359.54] but what I want to do,
[5360.10 → 5361.16] if I could go back
[5361.16 → 5361.94] and talk with him,
[5362.00 → 5362.76] I'd want him to ask
[5362.76 → 5363.54] the question to him,
[5363.96 → 5365.34] how did you learn?
[5366.48 → 5368.06] And I am almost certain
[5368.06 → 5369.74] that at a young age,
[5369.78 → 5370.64] he probably had moments
[5370.64 → 5371.42] where he's praying
[5371.42 → 5372.08] and he had images
[5372.08 → 5372.62] in his head.
[5372.62 → 5372.86] He's like,
[5372.90 → 5373.64] well, that's weird.
[5374.32 → 5375.30] Or he had times
[5375.30 → 5375.64] where he's like,
[5375.70 → 5376.56] I feel like I have
[5376.56 → 5377.70] this voice saying something
[5377.70 → 5378.34] that's not really
[5378.34 → 5379.04] my own voice.
[5379.30 → 5380.02] And he probably had
[5380.02 → 5381.08] many situations
[5381.08 → 5382.36] where he tried sharing
[5382.36 → 5383.82] and it wasn't the right time.
[5384.00 → 5384.96] Or where he tried
[5384.96 → 5385.64] to pray for someone
[5385.64 → 5386.40] and it felt awkward,
[5386.52 → 5388.06] but slowly and surely,
[5388.80 → 5389.98] he discovered the gift
[5389.98 → 5391.04] that God gave him
[5391.04 → 5392.78] was intercessory prayer.
[5393.64 → 5394.82] And by God's grace,
[5394.90 → 5396.38] he stepped bit by bit
[5396.38 → 5397.32] into the place where,
[5397.60 → 5398.42] like me, and I'm sure
[5398.42 → 5399.24] many other people,
[5399.56 → 5400.66] he used his gift
[5400.66 → 5401.86] and he blessed.
[5403.88 → 5404.90] What's that for you?
[5406.98 → 5407.92] What's the opportunity
[5407.92 → 5409.46] right in front of you
[5409.46 → 5410.30] that God has already
[5410.30 → 5410.90] given you,
[5411.34 → 5412.30] where you take the baby
[5412.30 → 5413.60] steps of faithfulness
[5413.60 → 5414.80] and in so doing,
[5414.90 → 5415.68] you will discover
[5415.68 → 5417.80] the power and the authority
[5417.80 → 5419.20] of Jesus working in
[5419.20 → 5420.72] and through you
[5420.72 → 5421.98] to bring blessing?
[5425.52 → 5426.58] Discipleship is not
[5426.58 → 5428.64] passive observance,
[5428.80 → 5429.88] although it includes that.
[5429.88 → 5431.30] It's not just watching
[5431.30 → 5432.66] Jesus or even other
[5432.66 → 5433.98] Christians do what they do,
[5434.02 → 5434.76] it's being invited
[5434.76 → 5437.64] and sent by Jesus himself.
[5437.80 → 5438.14] And church,
[5438.22 → 5438.96] let me say it as clear
[5438.96 → 5439.50] as I can,
[5439.98 → 5441.24] his grace is sufficient.
[5442.16 → 5443.64] His authority is real
[5443.64 → 5444.80] because the death
[5444.80 → 5445.48] and resurrection
[5445.48 → 5446.64] sealed forever,
[5447.14 → 5447.90] the presence
[5447.90 → 5449.40] of the kingdom of God
[5449.40 → 5450.78] that is yours to receive
[5450.78 → 5452.20] and yours to share.
[5453.00 → 5453.30] Amen?
[5453.30 → 5455.64] Let me pray for us.
[5455.64 → 5461.36] Father, we thank you
[5461.36 → 5463.32] that you have invited us
[5463.32 → 5464.48] to be followers
[5464.48 → 5465.40] of your son Jesus.
[5466.38 → 5467.44] And we praise you
[5467.44 → 5468.14] that the invitation
[5468.14 → 5468.98] to follow you
[5468.98 → 5470.60] has landed in our hearts,
[5470.78 → 5471.56] in our minds,
[5471.66 → 5472.46] in our community.
[5473.22 → 5474.06] I praise you
[5474.06 → 5475.54] that as young and old,
[5476.08 → 5477.68] we know who Jesus is
[5477.68 → 5479.00] and that his grace
[5479.00 → 5479.74] has met us
[5479.74 → 5481.12] in all of our brokenness.
[5481.12 → 5483.18] And we praise you further
[5483.18 → 5484.64] that you say,
[5485.04 → 5486.94] go and make disciples.
[5488.38 → 5489.86] We pray that you'd meet us
[5489.86 → 5490.64] in our fears,
[5491.36 → 5492.92] that your spirit
[5492.92 → 5494.04] would minister to us
[5494.04 → 5494.80] in our weaknesses,
[5495.32 → 5496.42] and even more than that,
[5496.46 → 5497.64] that you would use us
[5497.64 → 5498.50] in our weaknesses
[5498.50 → 5499.36] to demonstrate
[5499.36 → 5500.30] the power
[5500.30 → 5501.42] and the love
[5501.42 → 5502.24] of Jesus.
[5503.46 → 5504.58] I ask boldly
[5504.58 → 5505.66] that even this week,
[5506.16 → 5507.32] there would be moments
[5507.32 → 5507.90] and opportunities
[5507.90 → 5508.70] for us to take
[5508.70 → 5509.62] the baby steps
[5509.62 → 5511.50] and that in so doing,
[5511.62 → 5512.06] we would see
[5512.06 → 5513.00] the power of the gospel
[5513.00 → 5513.98] at work in
[5513.98 → 5515.24] and through us.
[5516.20 → 5517.44] And whatever opportunities
[5517.44 → 5518.32] there are, Lord,
[5518.98 → 5520.20] we pray that we would not
[5520.20 → 5521.14] steal your glory,
[5521.64 → 5522.28] but that we give
[5522.28 → 5523.22] all the praise,
[5523.62 → 5524.50] all the honour,
[5525.14 → 5526.18] all the worship
[5526.18 → 5527.02] to your son,
[5527.16 → 5527.88] Jesus Christ,
[5528.00 → 5528.52] our Lord,
[5528.62 → 5529.24] and our Saviour.
[5529.80 → 5530.86] In his name we pray.
[5531.32 → 5531.64] Amen.
[5532.40 → 5533.32] Would you stand
[5533.32 → 5533.98] and sing with me
[5533.98 → 5534.88] a song of response?
[5539.62 → 5547.68] What gift of grace
[5547.68 → 5550.62] is Jesus my redeemed?
[5551.88 → 5554.12] There is no more
[5554.12 → 5557.20] for heaven now to be.
[5557.20 → 5560.58] He is my joy,
[5561.12 → 5562.34] my righteousness,
[5563.00 → 5563.94] and peace.
[5563.94 → 5567.06] My steadfast love,
[5567.70 → 5570.82] my deep and honest peace.
[5571.76 → 5573.70] To this I hold,
[5574.16 → 5577.30] my hope is only Jesus.
[5578.70 → 5583.48] For my life is holy now to you.
[5584.94 → 5588.00] Oh, how strange and divine
[5588.00 → 5591.92] I can see all is mine
[5591.92 → 5595.58] and all I've come through Christ.
[5595.58 → 5609.94] The night is dark,
[5609.94 → 5613.16] but I am not the same.
[5614.34 → 5616.58] Oh, by my side,
[5617.08 → 5617.98] the Saviour,
[5618.34 → 5619.98] He will stay.
[5621.12 → 5623.22] I labour all
[5623.22 → 5624.54] in weakness
[5624.54 → 5626.50] and be chosen.
[5627.70 → 5629.58] Oh, in my name
[5629.58 → 5632.88] His power is displayed.
[5634.54 → 5636.30] This I hold,
[5636.72 → 5637.66] my shepherd,
[5638.02 → 5640.40] will defend me.
[5641.08 → 5644.30] Through the deepest valley
[5644.30 → 5645.84] He will live.
[5647.46 → 5650.78] Oh, the night has been won
[5650.78 → 5653.70] and I shall overcome
[5653.70 → 5655.80] yet not I
[5655.80 → 5658.50] through cause of me.
[5664.10 → 5665.74] Oh, faith I tread,
[5666.10 → 5669.04] I know I am forgiven.
[5670.16 → 5672.18] The future's sure,
[5672.90 → 5676.00] the price it has been paid.
[5676.00 → 5678.92] Oh, Jesus paid
[5678.92 → 5682.36] and suffered for my heart
[5682.36 → 5685.70] and He was raised
[5685.70 → 5689.22] to overthrow the land.
[5689.22 → 5692.14] To this I hold,
[5692.14 → 5695.64] my sin has been defeated.
[5696.96 → 5700.44] Jesus now and ever
[5700.44 → 5702.42] is my name.
[5703.48 → 5705.14] Oh, the chains
[5705.14 → 5706.14] I believe
[5706.14 → 5708.28] I can see
[5708.28 → 5709.88] I am free
[5709.88 → 5711.54] in love
[5711.54 → 5713.90] through Christ.
[5713.90 → 5730.76] Amen.
[5730.76 → 5731.82] Let's return the glory
[5731.82 → 5732.38] and pay
[5732.38 → 5734.82] for He has saved
[5734.82 → 5738.44] That He will bring me home
[5738.44 → 5744.38] In day by day I know He will return
[5744.38 → 5751.74] Until I stay with joy before the Lord
[5751.74 → 5758.82] To this I long, my hope is only Jesus
[5758.82 → 5764.56] For the glory of an old to Him
[5764.56 → 5770.80] If the rest is confessed in my days
[5770.80 → 5775.98] I'll repeat it, no, I've been through Christ
[5775.98 → 5782.98] In me, no, I've been through Christ
[5794.56 → 5798.44] It is a gift to receive God's blessing
[5798.44 → 5799.90] We started our service with it
[5799.90 → 5802.00] Our children were able to give that blessing
[5802.00 → 5803.10] And at the end of the service
[5803.10 → 5805.40] I invite you to hold out your hands
[5805.40 → 5808.18] And to receive the oldest blessing in the Bible
[5808.18 → 5810.24] This is called the Aaronic Blessing
[5810.24 → 5813.76] The Lord bless you and keep you
[5813.76 → 5817.64] The Lord make His face shine upon you
[5817.64 → 5819.22] And be gracious to you
[5819.22 → 5822.52] The Lord turn His face towards you
[5822.52 → 5825.06] And give you His peace
[5825.06 → 5827.90] And the church together says, Amen
[5827.90 → 5828.16] Amen
[5828.16 → 5833.14] We're going to close in one final song
[5833.14 → 5836.44] That reflects pillars of our faith
[5836.44 → 5838.88] Through creeds sung through generations
[5838.88 → 5839.76] Let's sing together
[5839.76 → 5859.14] Let's sing together
[5859.14 → 5863.06] Let's sing together
[5863.06 → 5863.72] I believe there is one salvation
[5863.72 → 5867.20] One doorway that leads to life
[5867.20 → 5875.80] One redemption, one confession, I believe in the name of Jesus Christ.
[5881.50 → 5888.80] I believe in the crucifixion, by His blood I have been set free.
[5888.80 → 5897.04] I believe in the resurrection, hallelujah, His love is destined for me.
[5897.86 → 5899.00] Sing, I'll pray.
[5900.14 → 5903.46] Oh, praise to God the Father.
[5903.82 → 5907.06] Oh, praise to Christ the Son.
[5907.74 → 5910.68] Oh, praise to the Holy Spirit.
[5910.68 → 5913.96] Our God has overcome.
[5915.06 → 5920.68] The King who was and is and evermore will be.
[5921.28 → 5926.08] In Jesus' mighty name, I believe.
[5927.20 → 5932.96] I believe, I believe.
[5938.86 → 5946.78] Do I believe that the hope of heaven is preparing a place for me?
[5946.78 → 5948.44] I love you all.
[5949.12 → 5950.46] Lots of magic.
[5950.90 → 5953.86] He's a flower who eyes have seen.
[5954.34 → 5957.54] I believe that a day is coming.
[5957.54 → 5960.54] He's returning to claim His bride.
[5961.54 → 5962.98] Light the altar.
[5963.58 → 5964.76] Keep it's burning.
