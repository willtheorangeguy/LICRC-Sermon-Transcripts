[670.64 → 672.36] ITAs
[672.36 → 672.84] films
[673.68 → 674.26] I just need the dock to
[674.26 → 674.64] Roy
[692.96 → 715.72] Here we go. There we go. Good morning. Welcome to worship. A special welcome if you are a guest
[715.72 → 722.30] with us this morning. An extra special welcome if you are a guest because of Jed's baptism.
[722.96 → 729.98] We are excited to see God at work in our midst here in our worship together. My name is Chris. I'm one of
[729.98 → 735.72] the pastors here at Langley Emanuel, and it's my privilege along with these others on stage to lead
[735.72 → 740.88] in our shared worship together this morning. Before we begin we have just one announcement
[740.88 → 747.10] and we've been making this announcement for the past couple weeks now. We are looking for drivers
[747.10 → 756.20] to pick up the Mexico mission team when they return from their trip on March 25. And so that
[756.20 → 763.78] is a drive to Seattle airport to pick them up. They will be ready to be picked up around 5 p.m.
[763.78 → 772.16] And so we currently have seats for 14 people. We need seats for 22. And so that's one or two more
[772.16 → 778.42] drivers depending on your vehicle. And so please if you're able to do that on the 25th connect with
[778.42 → 784.72] either myself or Pastor Kevin. And sooner is better. At least that will help our anxiety in ensuring that
[784.72 → 789.44] we can get everyone home. And that's the only announcement that we have this morning. And so I'm
[789.44 → 795.94] going to invite you as you're able to stand. We come together in worship of our good God who meets us
[795.94 → 805.18] in this place, who welcomes us, and who greets us. In this season of Lent as we approach the cross of
[805.18 → 812.50] our Lord Jesus Christ we do so prayerfully, reflectively, we do so in worship, reflecting on
[812.50 → 819.50] who God is and what he has done for us. And so let's enter this moment of worship together
[819.50 → 825.38] met by God. Following God's greeting I'm going to invite you to turn to those around you, welcome
[825.38 → 830.34] them into our shared worship together this morning by passing the peace of Christ, by saying good
[830.34 → 838.82] morning, and offering them a greeting as well. Receive the greeting of our God. Grace, mercy, and peace to
[838.82 → 844.02] you. From God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Saviour, through the
[844.02 → 847.38] presence and power of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[868.82 → 896.84] From Revelation 15. Great and marvellous are your deeds, Lord God Almighty. Just and true are your ways,
[896.84 → 905.56] King of the ages. Who will not fear you, O Lord, and bring glory to your name? For you alone are holy.
[905.56 → 908.76] All nations will come and worship you.
[908.76 → 924.04] Praise is rising. Eyes are turning to you. We turn to you.
[924.04 → 935.54] Praise is rising. Eyes are turning to you. We turn to you.
[935.54 → 951.54] Praise is rising. We turn to you. Hope is stirring. Lives are yearning for you. We long for you.
[951.54 → 966.54] Cause when we see you. We find strength to face the day. In your presence, all our fears are washed away.
[966.54 → 969.54] Washed away.
[969.54 → 985.54] Hosanna, Hosanna. You are the God who saves us. Worthy of all our praises.
[985.54 → 998.54] Hosanna, Hosanna. Come have your way among us. Welcome to here, Lord Jesus.
[998.54 → 1003.54] Hosanna, Hosanna. Come have your way among us. We turn to you.
[1003.54 → 1017.54] Hear the sound of hearts returning to you. Return to you.
[1017.54 → 1025.54] In your kingdom, broken lives are in you.
[1025.54 → 1044.54] You make us in you. You make us in you. Cause when we see you, we find strength to face the day. In your presence, all our fears are washed away.
[1044.54 → 1047.54] You are the God who saves us.
[1047.54 → 1063.54] You are the God who saves us. Worthy of all our praises.

[1070.58 → 1074.82] Come have your way among us
[1074.82 → 1078.04] We welcome you here, Lord Jesus
[1078.04 → 1085.60] Hosanna, Hosanna

[1090.00 → 1093.26] Worthy of all our praises
[1093.26 → 1100.80] Hosanna, Hosanna
[1100.80 → 1105.10] Come have your way among us
[1105.10 → 1108.50] We welcome you here, Lord Jesus
[1123.26 → 1131.64] Who else commands all the hosts of heaven?
[1131.64 → 1138.14] Who else can make every king bow down?
[1138.80 → 1143.84] Who else can whisper and darkness trembles?

[1198.46 → 1212.80] What other glory consumes like fire
[1212.80 → 1218.00] What other power can raise the dead
[1218.00 → 1225.54] What other name remains undefeated?
[1225.54 → 1227.54] Only a holy God
[1227.54 → 1235.08] Come and behold Him
[1235.08 → 1236.08] Come and behold Him
[1236.08 → 1239.08] The one and the only

[1361.78 → 1365.78] Come and worship the holy God
[1365.78 → 1375.32] Please bow your head with me as we pray
[1375.32 → 1378.32] Gracious God
[1378.32 → 1381.72] Our sins are too heavy to carry
[1381.72 → 1383.78] They're too real to hide
[1383.78 → 1386.26] And too deep to wade through
[1386.26 → 1390.36] Father, forgive the sins that we fear to name
[1390.36 → 1393.88] The guilt that our hearts struggle to bear
[1393.88 → 1398.14] And our thoughts that draw us far from you
[1398.14 → 1402.12] Living God, we confess these burdens to you
[1402.12 → 1403.76] In this time of silent prayer
[1403.76 → 1404.82] Amen
[1433.76 → 1444.20] Lord, set us free from our past
[1444.20 → 1446.74] and reveal to us the glorious future
[1446.74 → 1449.96] in which you have ushered in through your Son, Jesus Christ.
[1450.68 → 1454.18] Grant us grace to grow more and more in your likeness and image.
[1455.40 → 1456.30] Jesus, we love thee.
[1456.80 → 1458.86] And we pray this in your name. Amen.
[1463.76 → 1465.76] Amen.
[1479.76 → 1486.64] My Jesus, I love thee.
[1486.64 → 1491.48] I know thou art mine.
[1491.48 → 1501.76] For thee all the fallings of sin I resign.
[1502.42 → 1507.24] My gracious Redeemer,
[1507.64 → 1511.48] my Saviour art thou.
[1511.48 → 1522.76] If ever I love thee, my Jesus is now.
[1522.76 → 1535.76] I love thee because thou hast first loved me
[1535.76 → 1545.76] And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree.
[1545.76 → 1555.76] I love thee for wearing the thorns on thy crown.
[1555.76 → 1566.76] If ever I love thee, my Jesus is now.
[1566.76 → 1579.76] I love thee in life, I will love thee in death.
[1579.76 → 1590.76] And praise thee as long as thou lewdest me prayer.
[1590.76 → 1592.76] And say when the dead do not die,
[1592.76 → 1596.76] And say when the dead do not die,
[1596.76 → 1600.76] Hold on my crown.
[1600.76 → 1611.76] If ever I love thee, my Jesus is now.
[1611.76 → 1623.76] In that chance of glory and endless delight,
[1623.76 → 1632.76] I'll never adore thee in heaven so bright.
[1632.76 → 1644.76] I'll sing with a clitoric crown on my crown.
[1644.76 → 1654.76] If ever I love thee, my Jesus is now.
[1654.76 → 1677.76] I love thee, my Jesus is now.
[1677.76 → 1684.76] We are a moment, you are forever.
[1684.76 → 1691.76] Lord of the ages, God before time.
[1691.76 → 1698.76] We are a paper, you are eternal.
[1698.76 → 1699.76] Lord of the ages, O Lord forever.
[1699.76 → 1705.76] Love ever lastly, reigning on high.
[1708.76 → 1714.76] Holy, holy Lord God Almighty,
[1714.76 → 1721.76] Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[1721.76 → 1729.98] Highest praises, honour and glory
[1729.98 → 1736.74] Be unto your name
[1736.74 → 1743.86] Be unto your name
[1743.86 → 1747.60] We are the broken
[1747.60 → 1751.74] You are the healer
[1751.74 → 1755.00] Jesus, Redeemer
[1755.00 → 1758.22] Mighty to save
[1758.22 → 1762.54] You are the love song
[1762.54 → 1765.42] We'll sing forever
[1765.42 → 1769.64] Vowing before you
[1769.64 → 1774.50] Blessing your name
[1774.50 → 1778.14] Holy, Holy
[1778.14 → 1781.04] Lord God Almighty
[1781.04 → 1788.04] Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[1788.68 → 1795.04] Highest praises, honour and glory
[1795.04 → 1800.52] Be unto your name
[1800.52 → 1807.52] Be I to your name
[1807.52 → 1808.52] Be I to your name
[1808.52 → 1809.52] Be I to your name
[1809.52 → 1811.52] Be I to your name
[1811.52 → 1815.52] Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty
[1815.52 → 1821.52] Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[1821.52 → 1822.88] say
[1822.88 → 1824.88] highest
[1824.88 → 1826.34] praises
[1826.34 → 1829.58] honour and glory
[1829.58 → 1832.00] be unto
[1832.00 → 1835.76] your name
[1835.76 → 1838.72] be unto
[1838.72 → 1842.72] your name
[1842.72 → 1845.72] be unto
[1845.72 → 1848.72] your name
[1851.52 → 1855.18] you may be seated
[1855.18 → 1878.36] this morning in our shared life together we have the opportunity to celebrate the baptism of one of our little ones
[1878.36 → 1888.76] the water that we use here doesn't cleanse from sin but symbolizes for us Jesus life death and resurrection
[1888.76 → 1894.04] the water seals for us the promise of forgiveness
[1894.04 → 1904.48] so though born with a sinful nature this child is offered god's promise of forgiveness and life in the Holy Spirit
[1904.48 → 1908.14] and so in our church tradition
[1908.14 → 1910.04] we baptize infants
[1910.04 → 1911.98] not out of superstition
[1911.98 → 1913.82] but as covenant
[1913.82 → 1914.80] children
[1914.80 → 1917.32] god's covenant with Abraham
[1917.32 → 1920.62] was sealed by circumcision in genesis 15
[1920.62 → 1924.28] and that now finds its sign in baptism
[1924.28 → 1926.36] as we read in Colossians 2
[1926.36 → 1930.82] and through it the triune god marks our adoption
[1930.82 → 1933.18] and new identity in Christ
[1933.18 → 1936.18] a promise extended to our children
[1936.18 → 1938.18] in acts 2 verse 39
[1938.18 → 1941.28] and because god has called them holy
[1941.28 → 1942.90] god has set them apart
[1942.90 → 1945.02] we read that in first Corinthians 7
[1945.02 → 1948.68] and so baptism obeys Christ's command
[1948.68 → 1950.90] it aligns with church
[1950.90 → 1952.20] and our history
[1952.20 → 1954.66] and it signifies our inclusion
[1954.66 → 1956.22] in god's covenant
[1956.22 → 1957.20] community
[1957.20 → 1958.30] and today
[1958.30 → 1960.26] we celebrate and pray
[1960.26 → 1962.82] that Jed would embrace these promises
[1962.82 → 1967.48] and follow Jesus as his saviour throughout his entire life
[1967.48 → 1969.58] to do that we're going to ask
[1969.58 → 1971.86] Daniel and dismay to come to the front
[1971.86 → 1974.64] with whomever is coming up with them
[1974.64 → 1978.20] Olivia rolled her eyes at me
[1978.20 → 1979.62] I want everyone to know that
[1979.62 → 1986.94] so we're going to ask you guys just two questions
[1986.94 → 1990.58] and then Daniel and dismay invite you to respond by saying
[1990.58 → 1992.12] we do with god's help
[1992.12 → 1995.20] do you believe that your children
[1995.20 → 1996.86] those sinful by nature
[1996.86 → 1999.06] are received by god in Christ
[1999.06 → 2000.44] as members of his covenant
[2000.44 → 2002.30] and therefore ought to be baptized
[2002.30 → 2003.62] two
[2003.62 → 2006.56] do you promise in reliance on the Holy Spirit
[2006.56 → 2008.62] and with the help of the Christian community
[2008.62 → 2010.62] to do all in your power
[2010.62 → 2012.84] to instruct Jed in the Christian faith
[2012.84 → 2014.92] and to lead him by your example
[2014.92 → 2017.28] into a life of Christian discipleship
[2017.28 → 2018.28] what is your answer
[2018.28 → 2023.46] we'll get there guys
[2023.46 → 2025.18] this is how many tries now
[2025.18 → 2033.32] we mean together
[2033.32 → 2038.32] let's picture that togetherness for a moment
[2038.32 → 2039.34] our lord Jesus said
[2039.34 → 2040.98] let the little children come to me
[2040.98 → 2042.06] and do not hinder them
[2042.06 → 2044.34] for the kingdom of god belongs to such as these
[2044.34 → 2046.10] so I want to invite all the kids
[2046.10 → 2047.58] who are here this morning
[2047.58 → 2049.20] just to come and grab a seat
[2049.20 → 2051.04] nice and close up here in the front
[2051.04 → 2053.50] so that you can see what's going on
[2053.50 → 2064.18] many of you who are coming up here
[2064.18 → 2066.24] were also baptized
[2066.24 → 2068.68] many of you here in this church
[2068.68 → 2071.30] and I wonder how many of you remember that
[2071.30 → 2074.20] Paris you remember your own baptism
[2074.20 → 2075.60] amazing
[2075.60 → 2079.24] that's fantastic
[2079.24 → 2081.32] if you don't remember your baptism
[2081.32 → 2082.46] what I would love for you to do
[2082.46 → 2083.82] is talk to your parents
[2083.82 → 2085.68] or your parent after church
[2085.68 → 2086.10] and be like
[2086.10 → 2086.72] what was that like
[2086.72 → 2087.90] what did we do
[2087.90 → 2090.00] and if you haven't been baptized
[2090.00 → 2091.30] also talk to your parents
[2091.30 → 2091.64] and be like
[2091.64 → 2091.86] hey
[2091.86 → 2092.78] what's up
[2092.78 → 2094.82] why haven't we done that
[2094.82 → 2097.42] we're going to
[2097.42 → 2099.64] come and baptize
[2099.64 → 2100.56] Jed this morning
[2100.56 → 2101.26] and to do that
[2101.26 → 2102.02] we're going to use
[2102.02 → 2103.26] some water
[2103.26 → 2104.42] just as
[2104.42 → 2105.50] we use water
[2105.50 → 2106.50] to wash away
[2106.50 → 2107.16] our bodies
[2107.16 → 2108.12] so
[2108.12 → 2108.86] this water
[2108.86 → 2110.14] is a picture for us
[2110.14 → 2111.78] of what Jesus has done
[2111.78 → 2113.12] with his blood
[2113.12 → 2114.40] in washing us
[2114.40 → 2115.38] and making us new
[2115.38 → 2116.66] so I invite you to
[2116.66 → 2117.78] present Jed
[2117.78 → 2118.62] for baptism
[2118.62 → 2131.62] Jed wolf howling
[2131.62 → 2133.48] I baptize you in the name
[2133.48 → 2134.06] of the father
[2134.06 → 2136.24] and of the son
[2136.24 → 2138.56] and of the Holy Spirit
[2138.56 → 2139.82] amen
[2139.82 → 2147.36] amen
[2147.36 → 2150.66] even as we baptize Jed
[2150.66 → 2151.34] this morning
[2151.34 → 2152.62] and his parents
[2152.62 → 2153.38] have made a promise
[2153.38 → 2155.08] this is a covenant
[2155.08 → 2156.08] ceremony
[2156.08 → 2157.28] that means we do this
[2157.28 → 2157.96] all together
[2157.96 → 2159.14] and so you also
[2159.14 → 2160.84] as part of this covenant
[2160.84 → 2162.32] family have the opportunity
[2162.32 → 2163.64] to make a promise
[2163.64 → 2164.66] and so I'm going to invite you

[2166.02 → 2167.82] and I will ask you
[2167.82 → 2169.46] congregation gathered here
[2169.46 → 2170.94] a question as well
[2170.94 → 2171.88] and then invite you

[2172.70 → 2173.98] also saying
[2173.98 → 2175.30] we do with god's help
[2175.30 → 2176.18] and you can model for them
[2176.18 → 2177.18] how it's supposed to be done
[2177.18 → 2180.32] do you promise
[2180.32 → 2181.34] to love
[2181.34 → 2181.84] encourage
[2181.84 → 2182.76] and support
[2182.76 → 2183.40] Daniel

[2193.60 → 2194.74] of Christian faith
[2194.74 → 2195.42] and character
[2195.42 → 2197.00] and by giving the strong

[2523.60 → 2526.10] great is
[2526.10 → 2526.80] thy
[2526.80 → 2528.80] faithfulness
[2528.80 → 2529.88] Lord
[2529.88 → 2530.84] unto
[2530.84 → 2531.84] thee
[2531.84 → 2547.38] good
[2547.38 → 2561.82] morning my name is Pearl I'm one of the deacons here at Langley Emanuel, and we continue worship by having an offering today
[2561.82 → 2591.34] is both for the budget and for benevolence the budget is for the needs and the ministries of this church and if you would like to give to that then make sure that it's in a marked envelop you can use the envelopes that are in front of the chairs in front of you and the other offering is for benevolence which is a fund that's administered by the deacons, and it's for people who are in need that from this congregation or from the immediate community for people who are in need that are from this congregation or from the immediate community for
[2591.34 → 2598.34] people who are in need that of the church and for people who are in need that of the church and for people who may be experiencing unemployment or sickness or trauma and need some assistance.
[2599.06 → 2609.74] So thank you so much for being so generous and giving to the benevolent fund in the past and continue today to give with a happy heart. Thank you.
[2609.74 → 2624.26] We're going to sing who you say I am during the offering right now so as your gift please join us in this song which is about our identities rooted in Christ which we know are signified by our baptisms because God's grace for us precedes our knowledge of it.
[2624.42 → 2626.70] So please join us in singing who you say I am.
[2626.70 → 2653.38] Who am I that the highest thing would welcome me?
[2653.38 → 2658.76] I was lost, but he brought me in.
[2658.76 → 2662.38] Oh his love for me.
[2662.38 → 2666.38] Oh his love for me.
[2666.38 → 2667.38] Oh his love for me.
[2667.38 → 2671.38] Oh the sun sets free.
[2671.38 → 2676.38] Oh it's free indeed.
[2676.38 → 2680.38] I'm a child of God.
[2680.38 → 2683.38] Yes I am.
[2683.38 → 2684.38] Yes I am.
[2684.38 → 2690.38] Free in last he has ransomed me.
[2690.38 → 2694.38] His grace runs deep.
[2694.38 → 2699.38] While I was a slave to sin.
[2699.38 → 2703.38] Jesus died for me.
[2703.38 → 2708.38] Yes he died for me.
[2708.38 → 2712.38] Through the sun sets free.
[2712.38 → 2713.38] Oh his love for me.
[2713.38 → 2716.38] Oh his love for me.
[2716.38 → 2718.38] Yes I am.
[2718.38 → 2720.38] I'm a child of God.
[2720.38 → 2724.38] Yes I am.
[2724.38 → 2725.38] I am.
[2725.38 → 2726.38] Yes I am.
[2726.38 → 2727.38] Yes I am.
[2727.38 → 2728.38] Yes I am.
[2728.38 → 2731.38] I am chosen, not forsaken.
[2731.38 → 2732.38] I am who you say I am.
[2732.38 → 2733.38] I am who you say I am.
[2733.38 → 2734.38] You are for me, not against me.
[2734.38 → 2736.38] I am who you say I am.
[2736.38 → 2737.38] I am chosen, not forsaken.
[2737.38 → 2738.38] I am who you say I am.
[2738.38 → 2739.38] I am chosen, not forsaken.
[2739.38 → 2740.38] I am who you say I am.
[2740.38 → 2741.38] I am chosen, not forsaken.
[2741.38 → 2742.38] I am who you say I am.
[2742.38 → 2744.38] I am chosen, not forsaken.
[2744.38 → 2748.38] I am who you say I am.
[2748.38 → 2754.38] I am chosen, not forsaken.
[2754.38 → 2769.38] I am who you say I am.
[2769.38 → 2782.50] You are for me, not against me. I am who you say I am. Oh, I am who you say I am.
[2782.50 → 2798.66] Who the sun sets free, always believe in me. I'm a child of God, yes I am.
[2798.66 → 2815.24] In my Father's house, there's a place for me. I'm a child of God, yes I am.
[2815.24 → 2833.64] In my Father's house, there's a place for me. I'm a child of God, yes I am.
[2833.64 → 2863.62] I'm a child of God, yes I am.
[2863.64 → 2868.32] Okay, so today we're going to talk about a big word called perspective.
[2868.86 → 2872.22] Do you guys know what perspective means? What does it mean?
[2874.34 → 2877.66] Yeah, that's a good explanation. She said it's a different way of where you're looking.
[2877.78 → 2883.98] So how you see things. So we all have our own perspective how we see things, but our perspective can change.
[2884.32 → 2891.00] It's not always the same. So I want you to imagine you're at the playground, and maybe you've gone on the monkey bars
[2891.00 → 2896.00] or like one of those bars you can do little flips off. Has anyone been on those at school or at the park?
[2896.50 → 2899.10] And does anyone ever hang upside down on the monkey bars?
[2899.94 → 2904.16] You've done that? And does everything look a little bit silly when you're upside down?
[2904.48 → 2908.02] Because your perspective changed, right? You went upside down.
[2908.80 → 2911.12] Yeah? Like a monkey, exactly.
[2911.12 → 2915.32] People do look a little creepy then, you're right.
[2915.56 → 2918.20] If you look at them long enough, everything's upside down.
[2918.80 → 2922.34] So there's another way you can change perspective too is when you get older.
[2922.50 → 2925.18] When you get older, you might have a little bit of a different perspective.
[2925.86 → 2928.66] And I thought we'd have a good little demonstration of that today.
[2928.72 → 2933.54] I have the perfect person who can come up and demonstrate how their perspective has changed
[2933.54 → 2934.74] because they've gotten older.
[2934.74 → 2936.96] So I'm going to invite Pastor Kevin to come forward.
[2937.30 → 2938.32] He's going to sit right here.
[2940.82 → 2945.32] Now if you didn't know, you all are going to know that it is his birthday today.
[2945.88 → 2947.62] And we give him a big clap.
[2949.94 → 2951.58] Now we're going to play a little game.
[2951.68 → 2952.86] This is his favourite game.
[2952.92 → 2954.06] So I picked it just for him.
[2954.22 → 2955.22] And it's his favourite game.
[2955.28 → 2957.92] His game is Guess How Old Pastor Kevin Is.
[2957.96 → 2959.46] He loves playing this with the youth.
[2959.54 → 2961.96] If you're like a young adult, you might remember playing this.
[2962.46 → 2963.20] He loves it.
[2963.20 → 2964.52] Okay.
[2965.14 → 2965.62] All right.
[2965.70 → 2966.32] How about Mabel?
[2966.46 → 2967.52] How old do you think he is?
[2968.70 → 2969.62] You think he's 40?
[2970.06 → 2970.36] Okay.
[2970.44 → 2972.76] How old do you think he is, Ava?
[2975.28 → 2975.60] 43?
[2976.44 → 2977.42] What about Spencer?
[2977.42 → 2978.42] How old do you think he is?
[2983.28 → 2983.94] It's hard.
[2985.52 → 2985.92] 34.
[2986.34 → 2986.58] Oh.
[2987.00 → 2987.92] You're his new favourite.
[2989.76 → 2990.04] Malachi?
[2990.68 → 2991.64] You think he's 40?
[2992.02 → 2992.64] What do you think?
[2993.20 → 2994.08] You all think he's 40?
[2994.16 → 2996.22] Well, you are way better at this than the youth.
[2996.98 → 2999.90] I think someone thought he was 40, like, when he was 24.
[3000.12 → 3000.96] 19 years ago.
[3001.06 → 3003.60] You guys all, I'm sure, could get a gum ball for him after his birthday.
[3004.00 → 3005.72] He's 40, so we're going to do a little interview.
[3005.86 → 3011.20] So can you demonstrate how your perspective has changed in the last few hours that you've
[3011.20 → 3011.58] been awake?
[3011.58 → 3017.68] I have learned that giving my wife the microphone to Idlib Children's Worship Time is a bad idea.
[3017.68 → 3019.66] I've learned that that's gotten harder and harder.
[3020.68 → 3023.22] As you get older, you apparently get wiser.
[3023.54 → 3025.24] So we'll see if that becomes true.
[3025.24 → 3030.68] And I just, you grow in your love for others as well.
[3030.78 → 3030.90] Yeah?
[3035.68 → 3037.24] Well, thanks for coming up.
[3037.34 → 3038.36] You can go, you can sit down.
[3038.62 → 3042.88] You can go and see him for gum balls after the service, I'm sure, or wish him a happy birthday.
[3043.34 → 3047.40] But we're going to talk about how our perspective changes about the kingdom of God.
[3047.50 → 3048.58] So that's our topic today.
[3048.58 → 3053.12] We understand the kingdom of God from earth, but one day we get to see a new perspective
[3053.12 → 3057.64] when we get to see the kingdom of God that Jesus talks about in the Bible.
[3057.92 → 3061.78] So we're going to learn about the story of the mustard seed and some different examples
[3061.78 → 3065.26] that Jesus gives us to learn about what the kingdom of God is.
[3065.64 → 3067.44] So we can stand up for a moment.
[3067.62 → 3069.68] Everybody, stand up please with us.
[3069.78 → 3072.96] And the children are going to bless us and receive a blessing.
[3072.96 → 3073.06] Thank you.
[3078.58 → 3108.56] Thank you.
[3108.76 → 3109.80] full council.
[3110.06 → 3113.72] We had a meeting this past Tuesday evening.
[3115.20 → 3126.18] And regarding Pastor Kevin, we are going to have a town hall discussing the future of
[3126.18 → 3128.18] Pastor Kevin here at this church.
[3128.50 → 3132.70] He's going to be fully ordained sometime this year soon.
[3132.70 → 3140.70] So we want to ask you to put a placeholder for April 8th, the evening, that's a Tuesday evening for April 8th.
[3140.70 → 3142.50] If you could put that in your calendars.
[3144.12 → 3152.48] We also discussed a calendar for upcoming nominations for council members, both elders and deacons.
[3152.84 → 3160.90] We have a few that will be retiring this year, and we need you to think of who could fill their positions.
[3162.70 → 3164.64] And that calendar was put forward.
[3165.06 → 3171.64] And we also received updates from Pastor Chris and Pastor Kevin that work here at this church.
[3172.60 → 3173.64] Thank you.
[3187.98 → 3189.98] Good morning. I'm Peter.
[3189.98 → 3192.70] I'm a member of this church.
[3193.56 → 3204.88] I'm also a we have a men's meeting that meets on Thursday mornings at 10 from 10 to 1130 to discuss the pastor's sermons.
[3205.46 → 3210.88] And we can have anywhere from 8 to 12 people present.
[3210.88 → 3221.70] And one of the things that we do is we discuss, after we discuss the pastor's sermon and how it applies to our lives, life, we always have a time for, time for prayer.
[3222.24 → 3227.36] And it's amazing how many, when you have 12 people, just 12.
[3227.46 → 3238.22] So I can imagine among all of you here, if we, if I dig into your personal stories, there are always needs, there are always needs for prayer.
[3238.22 → 3248.56] One of the things that I like to think about too, though, is in the prayer, is how we fit into our communities and into our, into our society in which we live.
[3248.56 → 3251.86] And I think that's important.
[3251.86 → 3262.66] So for instance, I was thinking about when Jackie and I came here to this church in 1995, they were just starting out with the Mexico missions.
[3262.66 → 3266.38] So we're into, we're into 2025 now.
[3266.48 → 3272.46] If you do the math, that's 30 years of Mexican, Mexico missions, missions, trips.
[3272.76 → 3276.22] I think that's a that's an incredible legacy that we have.
[3276.56 → 3286.38] And when you think about it, one of our young people at the time, Jody, was there, and she married a fellow, Uriel, and they have their ministry there.
[3286.44 → 3289.32] And in two weeks, we'll be doing a collection for them.
[3289.54 → 3291.22] So let's keep them in our prayers.
[3291.22 → 3298.70] Also five years ago this week, COVID, COVID started, and the government clamped down on us.
[3298.78 → 3309.26] It's hard to believe it was five years already, but our church, all churches at Christianity in many ways felt threatened in some respects, but we persevered.
[3309.58 → 3319.54] And out of that has come, you know, the our services are now, you can, you can see them at home if you're, if you're, if you're ill.
[3319.54 → 3324.58] Also this week, we have a new prime minister, Mark Carney.
[3325.38 → 3331.24] And whatever we think of our politics, God does call us to, to, to pray for them and keep them.
[3331.24 → 3338.84] And Trudeau resigned and so, but he served us for, for, for 10 years.
[3339.72 → 3340.82] South of the border.
[3341.34 → 3343.78] These are things that we talk, we kind of talk about.
[3343.92 → 3349.78] We try not to get too, too fired up about our opinions about it, but I think it's important.
[3349.78 → 3357.90] But right now tariffs are a big deal and the U.S. president is, is fairly, has been fairly disruptive in terms of what's happening.
[3357.90 → 3368.86] And I know that's brought a lot of anxiety in our church community, too, among those of us who are in the employment business or looking for work and stability.
[3369.66 → 3375.06] We continue also to see in Ukraine and Russia, the conflict that's there.
[3375.06 → 3380.24] And we're hoping for peace there as well as in the Middle East between Israel, Hamas, Gaza.
[3381.06 → 3386.52] So there's a lot, a lot on our plate when we, when we go, when we go to prayer.
[3386.52 → 3397.70] And we keep coming back to like the sermon even from last, and I'm sure it'll be today from Thessalonians, where Pastor Chris last week told us about what happens when we die.
[3397.96 → 3399.30] We have a tremendous hope.
[3399.30 → 3403.12] But what happens if Christ returns before we die?
[3403.56 → 3405.58] We've had a wonderful discussion about that.
[3406.96 → 3412.02] In our congregation, we also have a lot of, a lot of needs.
[3412.74 → 3420.78] And, and I just want to kind of go through them because I'm not always sure exactly how to pray for these things because there are important details there.
[3420.88 → 3425.74] For instance, Tamara, Tara, sorry, Tara, where are you?
[3425.74 → 3432.32] Her husband, Al, has a, has a disintegrating disc disease and it's gotten so bad.
[3432.40 → 3436.10] There's nothing the doctors can do about it except shots for pain relief.
[3436.86 → 3440.96] Please pray for pain relief, for mobility, that something can be done to fix it.
[3441.62 → 3447.36] Also for Tara's brother-in-law, Joe, who was in hospital in Fredericton after having two strokes.
[3448.54 → 3453.04] Prayers for healing and that therapy to learn to walk and speed goes well.
[3453.04 → 3459.66] We have a lot of young kids that are sick and parents how to, and parents need to know how to care for them.
[3459.76 → 3460.82] That could create stress.
[3461.42 → 3468.26] We have ongoing mental health issues in our, in our, in our, our concerns as well in our church.
[3468.72 → 3472.26] And there's some who struggle with addictions and family dynamics.
[3472.26 → 3477.18] So if you dig in, there are all kinds of things that are, that are going on.
[3477.18 → 3480.40] Cancer also is a reality in our church community.
[3481.48 → 3485.40] Uh, Jerry and Enema's sister's dealing with cancer therapy.
[3486.06 → 3491.44] Um, Klaus and, uh, Amanda's sister Tanya.
[3492.60 → 3493.36] Cancer.
[3493.86 → 3496.98] John has just been introduced to, uh, cancer therapy.
[3496.98 → 3498.84] The Kemp and our family.
[3499.14 → 3500.20] Uh, so it's there.
[3500.20 → 3506.54] Um, the good news is Anne-Marie Van Men had her, had her heart valve repaired.
[3506.86 → 3509.48] And that's gone, uh, that's gone really well.
[3509.56 → 3511.06] And Judy Verse, where are you?
[3511.16 → 3514.40] You're, you're going to have your, uh, operation for a heart valve.
[3515.84 → 3520.04] In, in a, in a few, in a week or so, it's going to happen.
[3520.20 → 3524.82] So there are a lot of things happening in, uh, a lot of things that are happening.
[3524.96 → 3525.98] Let me lead you in prayer.
[3525.98 → 3530.80] Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[3532.10 → 3537.78] Your kingdom come, not just in Ukraine or in the Middle East, but even here.
[3538.76 → 3544.94] We've heard the promise that went to the, the Church of Thessalonica, that you are there for us.
[3545.44 → 3550.84] You are, you will be calling us home, or we will greet you as you return.
[3551.30 → 3553.00] We long for that day.
[3553.00 → 3555.38] Your will be done.
[3555.38 → 3558.18] As in heaven, so on earth.
[3559.00 → 3565.44] We are sometimes so perplexed, Lord, by what's going on in the body politic and in our neighbourhoods and in our community.
[3566.00 → 3567.48] We're often aghast.
[3567.48 → 3568.48] We're often aghast.
[3568.48 → 3571.40] But yet at the same time, we rely on, we rely on you.
[3572.44 → 3575.78] Give us this day our daily bread and a house to live in.
[3576.98 → 3583.46] We recognize that in most parts of the world, just to have one meal a day is a huge deal.
[3583.46 → 3586.46] Forgive us our sins.
[3586.46 → 3592.92] Forgive us our sins as we also have forgiven those who sin against us.
[3593.18 → 3596.34] It's the constant reminder every day for us.
[3597.30 → 3600.78] And bring us not, bring us not into temptation.
[3601.56 → 3603.12] There's so many around us.
[3603.34 → 3607.90] So many things around us that tempt us, but deliver us from the evil one.
[3607.90 → 3608.02] Amen.
[3609.02 → 3610.10] Yours is the kingdom.
[3610.48 → 3611.58] Yours is the power.
[3612.18 → 3614.00] And yours is the glory forever.
[3614.60 → 3614.98] Amen.
[3637.90 → 3653.14] We're going to spend the bulk of the rest of our time together looking at the next text out of the letter to the Thessalonians,
[3653.26 → 3654.70] the first letter to the Thessalonians.
[3655.12 → 3659.48] This morning we're going to read from 1 Thessalonians 5, 1 through 11.
[3659.98 → 3663.00] The first time through it will be on the screen behind me.
[3663.00 → 3668.32] But I encourage you, as you're able, open a Bible, whether it's on a device or if you brought one, excellent.
[3668.46 → 3671.50] If you're looking for one, there's a few at the back you can grab.
[3672.00 → 3676.34] And just have that and keep that open in front of you as we refer back to that throughout.
[3678.66 → 3682.72] Let's read together from 1 Thessalonians 5.
[3682.72 → 3690.88] Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write you,
[3691.34 → 3695.80] for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.
[3696.54 → 3704.24] While people are saying peace and safety, destruction will come on them suddenly as labour pains on a pregnant woman,
[3704.52 → 3705.86] and they will not escape.
[3705.86 → 3713.62] But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief.
[3714.18 → 3717.24] You are all children of the light and children of the day.
[3717.82 → 3720.62] We do not belong to the night or to the darkness.
[3721.56 → 3727.20] So then, let us not be like others who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober.
[3727.72 → 3731.40] For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.
[3731.40 → 3737.54] But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate
[3737.54 → 3739.80] and the hope of salvation as a helmet.
[3740.44 → 3746.40] For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath, but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[3747.20 → 3753.62] He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.
[3754.56 → 3761.34] Therefore, encourage one another and build each other up, just as, in fact, you are doing.
[3761.98 → 3763.12] This is the word of the Lord.
[3769.12 → 3775.66] I wasn't sure if I was going to introduce this message in this way until just five minutes ago
[3775.66 → 3779.02] when I found out that none of my family are in the service right now.
[3779.08 → 3780.64] They're all volunteering in other parts.
[3781.20 → 3782.58] And so I can say this safely.
[3782.58 → 3792.26] Have you ever had somewhere to go and a time you had to leave at, at, say, 7.55 in the morning,
[3792.44 → 3800.78] to get to school for 8 o'clock start, and you're standing at the door and no one else is ready to go?
[3800.78 → 3804.32] And you're just waiting and waiting?
[3804.32 → 3806.58] So, cards on the table.
[3806.66 → 3814.28] I'm the kind of person that I can sleep in with the best of them, but if I have somewhere to be, something to do, I can get up.
[3814.32 → 3815.54] It doesn't matter what time.
[3815.84 → 3819.36] It doesn't matter how little or how long of sleep I've had.
[3819.36 → 3821.20] But when I get up, I've got to start going.
[3821.86 → 3823.94] I'm not a lazy morning kind of person.
[3824.10 → 3828.88] I'm not a sit down with a coffee and read or play games on my phone.
[3829.26 → 3832.38] I'm a get-up, get dressed, and get out the door kind of guy.
[3832.38 → 3837.68] Now, my kids are a little different.
[3839.02 → 3843.14] Bless her heart, Nora is trying, and she's usually the first one ready.
[3843.84 → 3845.50] And then I won't tell you about Rachel.
[3847.96 → 3852.20] Let's just say that Nora and I are usually in the car and ready to go first.
[3853.78 → 3858.80] But we're waiting, we're ready, and we're waiting eagerly to go.
[3859.66 → 3862.24] And then we just wait and wait.
[3863.22 → 3863.98] And wait.
[3865.18 → 3868.16] Now, what is the attitude of my heart at that moment?
[3869.04 → 3872.74] Is it a posture of anticipation and excitement and readiness for what's to come?
[3872.88 → 3874.10] Or is there a grumbling?
[3874.86 → 3875.76] You can decide.
[3878.72 → 3884.04] This morning, in the text that Paul has for us to study and read,
[3884.04 → 3888.88] we are asking of our posture in waiting.
[3888.88 → 3893.62] And not just waiting for someone to be ready to go to school,
[3893.80 → 3900.18] but waiting for the return of Jesus Christ to this world and the restoration of all things.
[3900.54 → 3904.72] Are we ready, expectant, motivated, and eager?
[3904.72 → 3908.24] Or are we grumbling?
[3908.24 → 3915.08] Or perhaps worse, indifferent, and the ones not caring about what's coming next?
[3915.08 → 3921.18] The idea here that Paul presents to us that I believe the Lord wants us to see
[3921.18 → 3929.38] is the invitation for our waiting to be armed and ready for the day of the Lord is coming.
[3929.38 → 3933.74] Be armed and ready for the day of the Lord is coming.
[3933.74 → 3943.38] As we read, you can maybe see that verse 1 and 2 follow naturally from the section before.
[3943.38 → 3948.40] Last week, we looked at this section, and there, just a quick summary,
[3948.60 → 3952.18] we finished hearing a message about the return of Jesus,
[3952.62 → 3955.10] what it will be like, how it will look,
[3955.38 → 3959.04] and like Peter said before, what it means for us,
[3959.18 → 3962.72] and for those who have died, and for those who are still alive.
[3962.72 → 3967.24] And after that beautiful exposition and presentation,
[3967.66 → 3971.22] the next natural question that you and I might ask is,
[3971.48 → 3973.70] okay, that's great, but when?
[3974.92 → 3976.38] When is that going to happen?
[3977.00 → 3979.64] When will the return of Christ take place?
[3980.78 → 3983.68] And what's really fascinating, at least it's fascinating to me,
[3984.02 → 3986.56] is that you and I might ask that question,
[3987.00 → 3992.42] but it's one that Paul apparently doesn't think that Thessalonians need to ask.
[3993.02 → 3995.10] Because they should already know the answer.
[3995.58 → 3996.88] We read in verse 2 that,
[3998.30 → 4002.54] For you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.
[4003.36 → 4004.90] You know very well, he says,
[4004.96 → 4007.96] which means he probably taught this idea to them.
[4008.06 → 4010.98] It was part of his preaching to them regularly
[4010.98 → 4015.16] while he was there in Thessalonica for those three weeks,
[4015.54 → 4017.94] a few months before he wrote these letters.
[4018.42 → 4021.00] And he taught them this, in part, no doubt,
[4021.00 → 4024.46] because this is a message that Jesus himself taught.
[4024.56 → 4027.44] It's an image that he uses of his own return
[4027.44 → 4029.46] and the unexpected suddenness of it.
[4029.50 → 4031.06] You can read about that in Matthew 24.
[4032.20 → 4034.98] And Peter, actually, in his letter, says the same thing.
[4035.04 → 4035.34] He says,
[4035.42 → 4037.44] The day of the Lord will come like a thief,
[4037.58 → 4038.72] in 2 Peter 3.
[4038.72 → 4043.10] John uses this same image in the book of Revelation,
[4043.36 → 4045.58] in Revelation 3 and in Revelation 16.
[4046.38 → 4047.16] Point is,
[4047.70 → 4052.72] this idea that we know what the return of Christ will look like,
[4052.72 → 4054.68] but not when it will happen,
[4055.10 → 4057.08] because it will come like a thief in the night,
[4057.22 → 4059.24] seems to be a regular,
[4059.58 → 4063.22] commonplace teaching of the apostles in the early church.
[4063.22 → 4069.90] It was a teaching of Jesus that we don't know when he will return,
[4070.68 → 4073.90] and so the apostles continued that teaching.
[4075.50 → 4078.66] We know how, and we know what it means,
[4079.08 → 4081.18] and that ought to be enough, says Paul.
[4082.52 → 4086.36] And so with that, verse 3 continues with a bit of a contrast.
[4086.36 → 4088.50] And so it says,
[4089.14 → 4091.88] While people are saying peace and safety,
[4092.08 → 4095.66] or maybe your translation says peace and security there,
[4096.36 → 4099.46] destruction will come upon them suddenly.
[4101.18 → 4106.24] I want to do a little bit of historical and archaeological remembering with you
[4106.24 → 4106.88] for just a moment.
[4107.02 → 4109.38] And so if this isn't your cup of tea,
[4109.48 → 4110.82] just bear with me for a few minutes,
[4110.94 → 4113.80] but we'll have some images on screen as we go through.
[4113.80 → 4119.26] So remember that Thessalonica is a major Roman town,
[4119.80 → 4123.06] and Paul is writing to them from Corinth,
[4123.42 → 4125.82] which is another major Roman town.
[4126.72 → 4130.14] And on the coins and statues and monuments and gates,
[4130.30 → 4134.64] and in many of the writings of note and influence during this time,
[4135.12 → 4139.92] the gospel of the Pax Romana was declared everywhere,
[4140.04 → 4141.82] the gospel of the peace of Rome.
[4141.82 → 4144.24] If you look on screen behind me,
[4144.32 → 4145.98] and hopefully you can see it.
[4146.02 → 4148.54] If not, you can check out the live stream later and see the details.
[4149.02 → 4149.88] But trust me, they're there.
[4150.78 → 4154.50] The silver coin there on the bottom and to the left
[4154.50 → 4156.62] is called a cistophoric.
[4157.14 → 4159.76] This coin was minted in the 20s BC.
[4160.36 → 4162.44] It's worth about three denarii.
[4163.12 → 4165.82] And it was used as currency in the empire
[4165.82 → 4169.02] from about 27 BC until around 200 AD.
[4169.02 → 4172.70] And on the one side, it has the face of Augustus,
[4173.22 → 4175.16] the successor to Julius Caesar,
[4175.56 → 4178.76] the adopted son whose original name was Octavian.
[4179.44 → 4182.84] And on the other side, there's the inscription Pax,
[4183.38 → 4185.74] and the image of the goddess of peace.
[4186.78 → 4189.10] And so you have this connection to the emperor
[4189.10 → 4192.48] and peace being declared right on the coin.
[4192.48 → 4197.14] The gold coin that's up there is called an Boris,
[4197.36 → 4202.12] and it's minted around 40 AD and worth about 25 denarii.
[4203.00 → 4206.14] And it has the face of Claudius on one side,
[4206.26 → 4209.24] and he reigned as emperor until about 54 AD,
[4209.68 → 4211.78] which is right around the time these letters were written.
[4212.52 → 4214.88] So those coins would have been in circulation
[4214.88 → 4217.88] as Paul is writing these letters.
[4217.88 → 4220.52] And on the other side of that gold coin,
[4220.72 → 4223.64] it says Pass August,
[4223.84 → 4227.02] which means to the venerable peace in Latin.
[4228.26 → 4230.86] What you also see up there is this giant altar
[4230.86 → 4232.52] that's built in Rome,
[4232.78 → 4236.06] and that's called the Ara Pacis Augustae,
[4236.20 → 4238.62] or the altar to the Augustinian peace.
[4239.30 → 4241.52] It was built at the commemoration
[4241.52 → 4244.70] of Augustus Octavian's return to Rome,
[4245.12 → 4246.22] commissioned by the Senate
[4246.22 → 4249.60] and consecrated on January 30th, 9 BC.
[4249.86 → 4253.18] And it stood as a monument to the peace and prosperity,
[4253.48 → 4256.26] as a monument to the peace and safety
[4256.26 → 4258.28] of the Pax Romana.
[4260.14 → 4262.58] Now about 30 kilometres outside of Rome,
[4262.74 → 4263.74] in the next slide,
[4264.46 → 4267.46] is a small town called Palestrina.
[4268.42 → 4271.86] And there they recently excavated two altar pillars,
[4272.30 → 4273.84] and the one on the left,
[4273.84 → 4274.98] which you can't see at all,
[4275.12 → 4276.12] so you'll have to trust me,
[4276.22 → 4279.02] the one on the left says Pax Sacrum,
[4279.34 → 4282.60] and the one on the right says Security Sacrum,
[4283.08 → 4286.24] which means to the holy peace and to the holy security.
[4287.94 → 4289.50] So what I want you to hear and see
[4289.50 → 4292.72] is that it seems likely that when Paul says,
[4292.90 → 4295.76] well, people are saying peace and safety,
[4296.06 → 4298.18] he's picking up on a slogan
[4298.18 → 4299.78] or on a word pairing
[4299.78 → 4304.40] that would have been an obvious political force
[4304.40 → 4305.90] for the Thessalonians.
[4308.04 → 4308.82] Like I said,
[4310.82 → 4315.20] Thessalonica is the capital of the Macedonian region,
[4315.58 → 4316.64] and because of that,
[4316.70 → 4319.38] it is the regional home for the governor
[4319.38 → 4321.24] and the proconsul of the empire.
[4321.24 → 4327.04] The peace and security of the empire will fail.
[4327.62 → 4328.78] That's what Paul is saying.
[4329.40 → 4333.26] The gospel of Rome is illusory and short-lived.
[4334.26 → 4336.26] Destruction will come upon them.
[4336.26 → 4342.74] Even Rome can't save you from what's to come.
[4344.04 → 4345.26] Only Jesus can.
[4346.44 → 4347.50] I think that's the point
[4347.50 → 4349.30] that Paul is trying to underscore here.
[4351.06 → 4353.68] I read something this week
[4353.68 → 4354.92] that said,
[4354.92 → 4358.24] An indifferent church lacks motivation.
[4359.12 → 4361.50] A panicked church lacks peace.
[4362.64 → 4363.00] However,
[4364.14 → 4367.52] an expectant church is filled with passion.
[4368.48 → 4370.86] I should say an expectant church,
[4370.98 → 4372.32] not an unexpected church.
[4372.92 → 4375.94] An expectant church is filled with passion.
[4377.92 → 4378.82] Now, again,
[4378.92 → 4380.36] if you've been with us in this series,
[4380.36 → 4381.34] we've seen already
[4381.34 → 4383.42] that a sense of indifference
[4383.42 → 4386.02] existed in some of these Christians
[4386.02 → 4388.66] and in some of the people of Thessalonica.
[4389.12 → 4390.66] Paul urges them, right,
[4390.72 → 4392.06] to work with their hands
[4392.06 → 4394.10] and to not be dependent on anyone.
[4394.24 → 4396.10] That's 1 Thessalonians 4, 10.
[4396.56 → 4398.30] And in chapter 5 of this letter,
[4398.72 → 4402.02] and again in chapter 3 of 2 Thessalonians,
[4402.20 → 4405.66] he warns those who are being idle and disruptive.
[4407.54 → 4409.38] And that's actually part of why it's important
[4409.38 → 4412.96] not to know the dates and the times of Jesus' return.
[4413.42 → 4415.28] Because think about it from that perspective.
[4415.42 → 4417.34] If you know that you have hundreds
[4417.34 → 4418.82] or thousands of years,
[4419.54 → 4421.08] it's really easy to be indifferent.
[4422.56 → 4424.14] I'm a deadline kind of guy.
[4425.02 → 4426.26] And if I don't have a deadline,
[4426.76 → 4428.74] I don't have any anxiety about it.
[4432.02 → 4432.46] Indifference
[4432.46 → 4434.68] is a gospel killer.
[4434.68 → 4439.04] Faith,
[4439.54 → 4442.44] if your faith
[4442.44 → 4444.02] doesn't make you live differently,
[4444.84 → 4446.08] why should anyone care?
[4448.48 → 4448.92] Right?
[4448.96 → 4450.04] If your kids don't see
[4450.04 → 4451.46] a different approach to life,
[4451.90 → 4453.72] what would captivate their hearts
[4453.72 → 4455.20] to catch our faith?
[4456.94 → 4458.86] If everything about your life
[4458.86 → 4459.70] looks no different
[4459.70 → 4461.00] than your non-Christian friends
[4461.00 → 4461.84] or neighbours
[4461.84 → 4462.90] except that maybe
[4462.90 → 4464.42] you go to church twice a month,
[4464.76 → 4465.56] three times a month
[4465.56 → 4466.78] if you had a perfect time,
[4467.64 → 4467.84] right?
[4467.86 → 4468.54] Why should they care?
[4470.12 → 4470.34] Or,
[4471.28 → 4472.20] this is going to hit
[4472.20 → 4474.30] a few more of you particularly,
[4474.60 → 4475.86] but if you look to like
[4475.86 → 4477.16] Instagram or TikTok
[4477.16 → 4478.38] or YouTube
[4478.38 → 4480.50] and influencers there
[4480.50 → 4481.96] to determine
[4481.96 → 4483.22] what is going to bring you
[4483.22 → 4484.54] peace and safety,
[4485.00 → 4485.58] to tell you
[4485.58 → 4486.32] what the good life
[4486.32 → 4487.08] is going to be like,
[4487.10 → 4488.44] if those are your influences,
[4488.44 → 4490.32] how is that any different
[4490.32 → 4491.02] than the rest of the world?
[4493.40 → 4494.26] And is there something
[4494.26 → 4495.84] missing in that?
[4497.34 → 4497.52] Right?
[4497.54 → 4498.44] If the primary way
[4498.44 → 4499.24] that your neighbours
[4499.24 → 4500.64] experience your faith
[4500.64 → 4502.12] is because you're grumbling
[4502.12 → 4503.98] about whom the prime minister is
[4503.98 → 4505.38] or about whom the president
[4505.38 → 4505.96] might be,
[4506.92 → 4508.50] what would compel them
[4508.50 → 4510.08] to pick up the cross daily
[4510.08 → 4510.86] and follow Jesus?
[4512.34 → 4513.20] What's different?
[4514.04 → 4514.12] Right?
[4514.38 → 4514.86] Indifference
[4514.86 → 4516.48] is a faith killer.
[4516.48 → 4518.72] But real faith
[4518.72 → 4519.80] makes a difference.
[4520.72 → 4521.94] And it is a beautiful,
[4522.32 → 4523.28] magnificent thing
[4523.28 → 4524.88] to confess our sins
[4524.88 → 4525.80] to each other
[4525.80 → 4526.62] and to have God
[4526.62 → 4528.14] speak a word of forgiveness
[4528.14 → 4529.66] and assurance over you.
[4530.06 → 4531.44] It is a beautiful thing
[4531.44 → 4532.66] to see the scales
[4532.66 → 4533.84] of unbelief
[4533.84 → 4534.66] fall off
[4534.66 → 4536.34] the eyes of someone's heart
[4536.34 → 4537.48] and watch their world
[4537.48 → 4538.84] actually get brighter
[4538.84 → 4540.16] and more magnificent.
[4541.06 → 4542.10] It is majestic
[4542.10 → 4542.92] when the prayers
[4542.92 → 4543.62] of the saints
[4543.62 → 4544.28] are answered
[4544.28 → 4545.58] and healing comes.
[4545.58 → 4547.16] It is moving
[4547.16 → 4548.00] when a church
[4548.00 → 4549.24] full of people
[4549.24 → 4549.98] at a funeral
[4549.98 → 4550.84] can sing
[4550.84 → 4551.76] It is well
[4551.76 → 4552.90] with my soul.
[4555.14 → 4556.28] In the world
[4556.28 → 4557.80] apart from Christ,
[4558.76 → 4560.14] the world apart
[4560.14 → 4560.88] from Christ
[4560.88 → 4562.20] is indifferent
[4562.20 → 4563.52] to His return
[4563.52 → 4565.02] and to who He is
[4565.02 → 4566.04] and then also
[4566.04 → 4567.02] to the judgment
[4567.02 → 4568.78] that He will bring.
[4570.60 → 4572.08] And our indifference
[4572.08 → 4573.44] only confirms
[4573.44 → 4574.16] their right
[4574.16 → 4574.78] to be so.
[4576.42 → 4577.56] One writer I read
[4577.56 → 4578.38] said that
[4578.38 → 4580.20] God's solemn warnings
[4580.20 → 4580.98] of judgments
[4580.98 → 4582.08] are often met
[4582.08 → 4583.60] by the world's yawn.
[4585.66 → 4586.74] The kingdoms
[4586.74 → 4587.70] of the world
[4587.70 → 4588.94] that are saying
[4588.94 → 4590.56] peace and safety,
[4590.70 → 4591.12] the kingdoms
[4591.12 → 4592.36] of the world
[4592.36 → 4593.34] whisper peace
[4593.34 → 4594.14] and security
[4594.14 → 4595.60] and they lull people
[4595.60 → 4597.40] into a waking sleep,
[4597.74 → 4599.52] a spiritual listlessness,
[4599.80 → 4601.42] a malaise of indifference,
[4601.42 → 4602.82] relative peace
[4602.82 → 4604.78] and a terrestrial security,
[4604.98 → 4605.84] fool the masses
[4605.84 → 4606.92] and they amass
[4606.92 → 4607.58] the foolish.
[4609.14 → 4610.20] But indifference
[4610.20 → 4610.86] to God
[4610.86 → 4612.36] is always
[4612.36 → 4613.28] deadly.
[4613.28 → 4617.46] You can't sit
[4617.46 → 4618.32] on the fence anymore.
[4620.16 → 4620.84] It's time
[4620.84 → 4621.46] to dive in.
[4623.36 → 4624.44] For most of you
[4624.44 → 4625.18] here this morning,
[4625.32 → 4625.76] you know.
[4626.58 → 4627.46] You already
[4627.46 → 4628.30] know
[4628.30 → 4629.44] what you need
[4629.44 → 4629.96] to know.
[4630.14 → 4630.98] The question is
[4630.98 → 4632.10] what will you do
[4632.10 → 4632.52] with it?
[4633.88 → 4634.34] Right?
[4634.38 → 4634.96] We don't need
[4634.96 → 4635.46] to know
[4635.46 → 4636.24] when Jesus
[4636.24 → 4636.92] will return.
[4637.16 → 4637.82] We need to know
[4637.82 → 4639.20] that He will return.
[4639.54 → 4640.72] And when He does,
[4640.72 → 4642.16] the only way through
[4642.16 → 4643.24] will be by believing
[4643.24 → 4644.42] in Him now,
[4644.56 → 4645.78] by receiving His mercy
[4645.78 → 4646.76] and grace now
[4646.76 → 4648.24] and living with perseverance
[4648.24 → 4648.98] until the end.
[4649.92 → 4651.72] The Bible doesn't shy away
[4651.72 → 4652.62] from the reality
[4652.62 → 4653.22] of judgment
[4653.22 → 4654.42] and so neither can we.
[4656.16 → 4656.72] Instead,
[4657.36 → 4658.32] in the time
[4658.32 → 4659.12] that we have,
[4659.64 → 4660.60] let's be different.
[4661.64 → 4662.76] Let's be motivated
[4662.76 → 4663.66] to snatch people
[4663.66 → 4664.76] away from the fire
[4664.76 → 4665.52] like we read
[4665.52 → 4666.28] in Jude 23.
[4667.14 → 4668.48] We cannot be
[4668.48 → 4669.14] indifferent.
[4669.98 → 4670.04] Right?
[4670.04 → 4670.98] We must care.
[4671.12 → 4672.16] We must make a difference.
[4672.28 → 4673.32] We must be motivated
[4673.32 → 4674.70] to declare the truth
[4674.70 → 4675.78] of God's gospel
[4675.78 → 4677.32] because that's the only way
[4677.32 → 4678.26] for people to have
[4678.26 → 4678.96] real peace
[4678.96 → 4680.16] and real security.
[4682.06 → 4682.70] And especially
[4682.70 → 4684.40] as we baptize
[4684.40 → 4684.88] an infant
[4684.88 → 4686.20] into this truth
[4686.20 → 4687.00] today,
[4687.22 → 4689.08] we cannot be indifferent
[4689.08 → 4690.76] because He will see
[4690.76 → 4691.70] your indifference.
[4693.16 → 4694.46] They will see it.
[4695.36 → 4696.54] And so let us all together
[4696.54 → 4697.84] be different.
[4697.84 → 4700.52] And how
[4700.52 → 4702.14] of our being different
[4702.14 → 4703.28] matters here.
[4704.08 → 4704.74] That's to say
[4704.74 → 4706.12] we are not panicked.
[4706.92 → 4707.02] Right?
[4707.08 → 4707.68] Our declaring
[4707.68 → 4708.40] of the gospel
[4708.40 → 4709.78] is with gentleness
[4709.78 → 4710.60] and respect.
[4710.84 → 4711.36] It is rooted
[4711.36 → 4712.22] in love
[4712.22 → 4712.84] for the world
[4712.84 → 4713.92] and it is expressed
[4713.92 → 4714.94] in love
[4714.94 → 4715.98] for those whom
[4715.98 → 4717.44] God Himself loves.
[4718.14 → 4719.14] Instead of panic,
[4719.26 → 4720.40] we have peace.
[4721.12 → 4722.02] Let me put it this way
[4722.02 → 4722.36] for us.
[4722.36 → 4725.14] The things we know
[4725.14 → 4725.94] about God
[4725.94 → 4728.12] far outweigh
[4728.12 → 4728.72] the things
[4728.72 → 4729.64] we don't know
[4729.64 → 4730.34] about our life
[4730.34 → 4730.92] in this world.
[4732.12 → 4733.24] Let me say that again
[4733.24 → 4733.72] for the people
[4733.72 → 4734.16] in the back.
[4734.46 → 4735.24] The things we know
[4735.24 → 4735.94] about God
[4735.94 → 4737.76] far outweighs
[4737.76 → 4739.98] the things we don't know
[4739.98 → 4740.82] about our life
[4740.82 → 4741.54] in this world.
[4744.48 → 4745.62] I don't know
[4745.62 → 4746.24] what tomorrow
[4746.24 → 4746.82] will bring,
[4747.78 → 4748.56] but I know
[4748.56 → 4748.92] the God
[4748.92 → 4749.74] who brings tomorrow.
[4749.74 → 4752.62] I don't know
[4752.62 → 4753.24] how the story
[4753.24 → 4753.86] of my life
[4753.86 → 4754.44] will end,
[4754.64 → 4755.22] but I know
[4755.22 → 4755.94] how the story
[4755.94 → 4756.64] of history
[4756.64 → 4757.46] will end
[4757.46 → 4758.24] because of whom
[4758.24 → 4758.88] God is.
[4760.30 → 4761.40] That you may not
[4761.40 → 4762.60] know why you
[4762.60 → 4763.60] have some disease
[4763.60 → 4764.62] and you may just
[4764.62 → 4765.64] be tired of it all,
[4766.58 → 4767.70] but you do know
[4767.70 → 4768.58] the voice of Him
[4768.58 → 4769.00] who said,
[4769.30 → 4769.76] come to me
[4769.76 → 4770.66] all who are weary
[4770.66 → 4771.50] and heavy laden
[4771.50 → 4773.14] and I will give you
[4773.14 → 4773.98] rest.
[4776.46 → 4777.24] I don't know
[4777.24 → 4778.10] what comes next,
[4778.10 → 4780.26] but I know
[4780.26 → 4781.40] that I am known
[4781.40 → 4782.08] by the God
[4782.08 → 4782.68] who does
[4782.68 → 4784.82] and that is
[4784.82 → 4786.80] better by far.
[4787.10 → 4787.32] Amen?
[4789.32 → 4790.50] That's real peace.
[4791.50 → 4792.58] A peace that's not
[4792.58 → 4793.38] dependent upon
[4793.38 → 4794.32] my circumstances
[4794.32 → 4795.20] but on the character
[4795.20 → 4795.74] of God.
[4796.68 → 4797.74] That's real peace.
[4798.56 → 4799.58] If indifference
[4799.58 → 4800.78] kills motivation
[4800.78 → 4801.90] and being panicked
[4801.90 → 4802.86] wrecks our peace,
[4803.18 → 4804.14] the counter vision
[4804.14 → 4804.94] that the gospel
[4804.94 → 4805.82] casts for us
[4805.82 → 4807.18] is motivation
[4807.18 → 4808.78] and peace
[4808.78 → 4809.74] coming together
[4809.74 → 4810.40] to make
[4810.40 → 4811.66] an expectant
[4811.66 → 4813.14] and passionate church
[4813.14 → 4815.08] and we can be
[4815.08 → 4815.90] expectant
[4815.90 → 4816.86] because we believe
[4816.86 → 4817.32] and know
[4817.32 → 4818.34] that God is at work
[4818.34 → 4818.98] among us,
[4819.26 → 4820.34] that God is in control,
[4820.70 → 4821.44] that led by His
[4821.44 → 4822.16] sovereign rule
[4822.16 → 4823.50] and providential guiding,
[4823.66 → 4824.66] history is moving
[4824.66 → 4825.82] towards the return
[4825.82 → 4826.86] of Jesus Christ,
[4826.96 → 4828.18] ever marching forward
[4828.18 → 4829.32] for His glory
[4829.32 → 4830.44] and for our good.
[4830.44 → 4832.54] we know that
[4832.54 → 4834.68] our present sufferings
[4834.68 → 4836.14] will be incomparable
[4836.14 → 4837.14] to the glory
[4837.14 → 4838.24] that will be revealed
[4838.24 → 4839.20] in us
[4839.20 → 4840.08] and to us
[4840.08 → 4840.94] and through us.
[4841.52 → 4842.30] We know that
[4842.30 → 4843.10] compared to
[4843.10 → 4844.66] an eternity with God,
[4844.92 → 4845.52] these light
[4845.52 → 4846.80] and momentary struggles
[4846.80 → 4847.60] are producing
[4847.60 → 4849.26] an eternal weight
[4849.26 → 4849.82] of glory.
[4850.14 → 4851.74] Because of who God is,
[4851.94 → 4853.00] we have purpose
[4853.00 → 4853.94] and meaning.
[4854.30 → 4855.18] We have an identity
[4855.18 → 4856.40] that goes beyond
[4856.40 → 4857.98] our physical feelings
[4857.98 → 4859.78] and our present moments.
[4859.78 → 4860.80] and so,
[4861.12 → 4862.18] we can be
[4862.18 → 4864.08] an expectant people
[4864.08 → 4868.12] and we can be
[4868.12 → 4869.50] passionate
[4869.50 → 4871.68] about this truth
[4871.68 → 4873.58] and about this God,
[4873.78 → 4874.72] about who He is
[4874.72 → 4875.80] and what He is doing
[4875.80 → 4876.80] in our midst,
[4876.96 → 4878.90] desiring that all people
[4878.90 → 4879.58] might see
[4879.58 → 4880.50] and know
[4880.50 → 4881.58] God this way.
[4882.84 → 4883.64] Our passion
[4883.64 → 4884.54] is an invitation
[4884.54 → 4885.70] to come
[4885.70 → 4886.36] and see
[4886.36 → 4887.12] a God
[4887.12 → 4888.00] at work.
[4888.34 → 4888.86] Our passion
[4888.86 → 4889.72] is a display
[4889.72 → 4890.54] of God's work
[4890.54 → 4891.08] among us.
[4891.16 → 4891.68] Our passion
[4891.68 → 4892.64] is to sing
[4892.64 → 4893.30] His praises
[4893.30 → 4894.06] even though
[4894.06 → 4894.56] we walk
[4894.56 → 4895.10] through the valley
[4895.10 → 4895.64] of the shadow
[4895.64 → 4896.00] of death.
[4896.32 → 4896.80] Our passion
[4896.80 → 4897.40] is to sing
[4897.40 → 4898.00] His praises
[4898.00 → 4898.70] as we stand
[4898.70 → 4899.98] on the mountaintops
[4899.98 → 4900.76] of life.
[4900.88 → 4901.46] Our passion
[4901.46 → 4902.52] is for the next
[4902.52 → 4903.72] generation of believers
[4903.72 → 4904.90] to be raised up
[4904.90 → 4905.84] in our midst.
[4906.18 → 4906.62] Our passion
[4906.62 → 4907.30] is for the next
[4907.30 → 4908.20] generation of church
[4908.20 → 4908.78] leaders to be
[4908.78 → 4910.16] discipled right here
[4910.16 → 4910.94] and right now
[4910.94 → 4911.74] and sent out
[4911.74 → 4912.66] into the world.
[4912.78 → 4913.30] Our passion
[4913.30 → 4914.40] is to raise up
[4914.40 → 4915.68] an army of missionaries
[4915.68 → 4916.32] who will go
[4916.32 → 4917.74] into their workplaces
[4917.74 → 4918.70] and third places
[4918.70 → 4919.22] locally
[4919.22 → 4920.54] and globally
[4920.54 → 4921.86] all around the globe
[4921.86 → 4923.70] with this gospel message.
[4923.70 → 4924.30] The message
[4924.30 → 4925.26] of Jesus' life,
[4925.64 → 4925.88] death,
[4926.08 → 4926.46] resurrection,
[4926.72 → 4927.52] and exaltation.
[4927.86 → 4928.44] The message
[4928.44 → 4929.56] of His return
[4929.56 → 4930.50] to judge
[4930.50 → 4931.04] the living
[4931.04 → 4932.14] and the dead.
[4933.14 → 4934.82] And it's for this passion,
[4935.20 → 4936.18] this passion
[4936.18 → 4937.40] that we must be
[4937.40 → 4939.08] armed and ready
[4939.08 → 4940.62] because the day
[4940.62 → 4940.90] of the Lord
[4940.90 → 4941.34] is coming.
[4943.10 → 4943.94] Verse 5 says,
[4943.94 → 4945.70] you are all children
[4945.70 → 4947.20] of light
[4947.20 → 4947.90] and children
[4947.90 → 4949.24] of the day.
[4949.84 → 4950.72] Jesus said,
[4951.00 → 4951.86] you are the light
[4951.86 → 4952.48] of the world.
[4953.42 → 4955.10] You are an army
[4955.10 → 4955.82] for the day
[4955.82 → 4956.40] of the Lord.
[4957.26 → 4957.80] This speaks
[4957.80 → 4958.60] to our identity
[4958.60 → 4959.90] and our purpose.
[4960.06 → 4960.50] This speaks
[4960.50 → 4961.52] to your motivation.
[4962.12 → 4962.88] Children of the light
[4962.88 → 4963.98] and children of the day
[4963.98 → 4965.74] cannot be indifferent
[4965.74 → 4966.46] to darkness.
[4969.62 → 4970.50] So then,
[4970.62 → 4971.54] let us not be like
[4971.54 → 4972.80] others who are asleep
[4972.80 → 4976.00] but let us be awake
[4976.00 → 4977.74] and sober.
[4979.72 → 4980.02] Again,
[4980.08 → 4980.92] it's interesting to me
[4980.92 → 4982.76] that in the previous section
[4982.76 → 4983.90] Paul uses
[4983.90 → 4985.42] the metaphor of sleep
[4985.42 → 4986.66] to refer to death
[4986.66 → 4987.48] and now
[4987.48 → 4988.32] he's talking about
[4988.32 → 4990.08] those who do not know Christ
[4990.08 → 4991.18] as being asleep
[4991.18 → 4992.36] and the deeds
[4992.36 → 4993.20] that they do
[4993.20 → 4994.48] being the deeds
[4994.48 → 4995.16] of darkness.
[4996.04 → 4996.58] He says that
[4996.58 → 4997.18] Christians
[4997.18 → 4998.10] are the ones
[4998.10 → 4999.00] who are alive.
[4999.86 → 5000.58] There's a sense
[5000.58 → 5002.42] in which the spiritual reality
[5002.42 → 5004.06] that we find ourselves in
[5004.06 → 5005.98] is one of deathliness
[5005.98 → 5007.32] apart from Christ.
[5007.78 → 5008.84] But in Christ
[5008.84 → 5009.72] we are finally
[5009.72 → 5011.38] actually alive.
[5012.24 → 5013.08] There's something
[5013.08 → 5013.98] about life
[5013.98 → 5015.36] already now
[5015.36 → 5016.70] that has the marks
[5016.70 → 5018.18] of eternal life
[5018.18 → 5018.62] in it.
[5020.14 → 5020.86] And Jesus said,
[5021.50 → 5022.08] and this will be
[5022.08 → 5022.96] on the screen behind me,
[5023.40 → 5024.36] read with me.
[5024.42 → 5025.02] Jesus said,
[5025.34 → 5026.14] the Son of Man
[5026.14 → 5027.22] must be lifted
[5027.22 → 5027.74] that everyone
[5027.74 → 5028.80] who believes in Him
[5028.80 → 5030.20] may have eternal life.
[5031.02 → 5031.54] And then John
[5031.54 → 5032.32] goes on to comment.
[5032.48 → 5032.74] He says,
[5033.06 → 5034.14] for God so loved
[5034.14 → 5034.58] the world
[5034.58 → 5035.26] that He gave
[5035.26 → 5036.84] His one and only Son
[5036.84 → 5037.82] that whoever believes
[5037.82 → 5038.16] in Him
[5038.16 → 5039.10] shall not perish
[5039.10 → 5040.52] but have eternal life.
[5041.16 → 5041.98] For God did not
[5041.98 → 5042.74] send His Son
[5042.74 → 5043.48] into the world
[5043.48 → 5044.44] to condemn the world
[5044.44 → 5045.46] but to save the world
[5045.46 → 5045.92] through Him.
[5046.20 → 5047.32] Whoever believes in Him
[5047.32 → 5048.24] is not condemned.
[5048.94 → 5049.98] This is the verdict.
[5050.20 → 5050.96] Light has come
[5050.96 → 5051.64] into the world
[5051.64 → 5052.52] but people have loved
[5052.52 → 5053.72] darkness instead of light
[5053.72 → 5054.86] because their deeds
[5054.86 → 5055.34] were evil.
[5055.68 → 5056.52] But whoever lives
[5056.52 → 5057.06] by the truth
[5057.06 → 5058.42] comes into the light
[5058.42 → 5060.78] so that it may be seen plainly
[5060.78 → 5062.14] that what they have done
[5062.14 → 5062.96] has been done
[5062.96 → 5065.12] in the sight of God.
[5066.90 → 5068.10] Eternal life,
[5068.80 → 5070.84] the life of light,
[5071.14 → 5073.14] is not only about quantity,
[5073.58 → 5074.32] about the length
[5074.32 → 5075.72] of unending days,
[5075.90 → 5077.58] but it is about quality.
[5078.12 → 5079.50] It's about the kind of life
[5079.50 → 5081.18] you live already now,
[5081.42 → 5082.92] at this moment,
[5083.20 → 5083.92] in this world.
[5084.12 → 5085.40] That's the message of Jesus.
[5085.66 → 5086.86] That's the message of Paul
[5086.86 → 5088.36] here in Thessalonians.
[5088.46 → 5089.44] That's the life
[5089.44 → 5090.82] that we baptized Jed
[5090.82 → 5092.16] into this morning.
[5093.40 → 5094.70] And make no mistake about it,
[5094.90 → 5096.04] quality here
[5096.04 → 5097.52] does not mean easy.
[5098.86 → 5099.08] Right?
[5099.10 → 5099.32] In fact,
[5099.38 → 5100.86] we're given the opposite picture
[5100.86 → 5102.40] as we are instructed
[5102.40 → 5103.38] by Paul
[5103.38 → 5105.18] to put on faith and love
[5105.18 → 5106.14] as a breastplate.
[5106.70 → 5106.92] Right?
[5107.00 → 5108.72] And put on the hope
[5108.72 → 5109.44] of salvation
[5109.44 → 5110.16] as a helmet.
[5111.60 → 5112.04] Right?
[5112.04 → 5113.22] This is prepping for war.
[5114.22 → 5115.62] There's a spiritual battle
[5115.62 → 5117.16] between light and dark,
[5117.28 → 5118.52] between heaven and hell.
[5118.76 → 5119.70] That's the life
[5119.70 → 5120.60] you are entering.
[5122.88 → 5124.02] And to that end,
[5124.86 → 5126.32] let me tie this metaphor
[5126.32 → 5127.72] back to the language
[5127.72 → 5128.50] from the beginning.
[5130.78 → 5131.62] An indifferent
[5131.62 → 5134.28] or a panicked soldier
[5134.28 → 5135.94] risks losing
[5135.94 → 5137.04] his entire platoon,
[5138.68 → 5139.52] risks the life
[5139.52 → 5141.16] of his entire platoon.
[5141.16 → 5144.60] There is an identity here
[5144.60 → 5147.30] and a mission-critical way
[5147.30 → 5149.04] of living together.
[5152.04 → 5153.42] For the security
[5153.42 → 5154.46] of all of us
[5154.46 → 5156.68] to be motivated
[5156.68 → 5158.36] with the gospel.
[5160.04 → 5161.16] The temptation is strong
[5161.72 → 5162.68] and the truth
[5162.68 → 5163.82] of the matter is real.
[5164.66 → 5165.72] Some of us
[5165.72 → 5166.74] are choosing
[5166.74 → 5167.44] deathliness
[5167.44 → 5168.90] and spiritual sleep
[5168.90 → 5170.10] over real living.
[5170.10 → 5171.74] real humanity,
[5171.94 → 5172.68] real mission
[5172.68 → 5174.08] is lived with God.
[5175.68 → 5176.64] But the pull
[5176.64 → 5177.36] of the empire
[5177.36 → 5178.76] is strong.
[5179.92 → 5181.40] Whether it's on coins
[5181.40 → 5182.82] or altars
[5182.82 → 5183.44] and pillars
[5183.44 → 5185.26] or on TikTok
[5185.26 → 5186.94] and YouTube,
[5187.94 → 5188.88] the promise
[5188.88 → 5190.68] of easy peace
[5190.68 → 5192.40] and easy safety
[5192.40 → 5193.58] is alluring.
[5195.26 → 5196.46] But it's a lie.
[5196.46 → 5200.36] don't believe the lie.
[5201.86 → 5202.44] Instead,
[5203.14 → 5203.92] instead,
[5204.50 → 5205.24] armour up
[5205.24 → 5206.80] and find
[5206.80 → 5208.52] real life.
[5209.24 → 5209.50] Amen?
[5210.18 → 5211.30] Let's pray together.
[5211.30 → 5217.66] Holy God,
[5217.74 → 5218.34] Heavenly Father,
[5218.84 → 5219.42] in the power
[5219.42 → 5220.50] of your spirit,
[5221.30 → 5221.88] may we go
[5221.88 → 5222.98] from this place
[5222.98 → 5225.04] armed and armoured
[5225.04 → 5226.56] with the power
[5226.56 → 5227.48] of the gospel.
[5228.48 → 5229.16] May we go
[5229.16 → 5230.54] from this place
[5230.54 → 5233.84] wearing the breastplate
[5233.84 → 5234.52] of faith
[5234.52 → 5235.22] and love.
[5235.90 → 5236.46] May we go
[5236.46 → 5237.24] from this place
[5237.24 → 5238.12] with the helmet
[5238.12 → 5238.66] of the hope
[5238.66 → 5239.32] of salvation.
[5239.32 → 5239.82] we go
[5239.82 → 5240.52] from this place
[5240.52 → 5241.96] with the sword
[5241.96 → 5242.64] of the word
[5242.64 → 5243.12] of God.
[5243.22 → 5243.70] May we go
[5243.70 → 5244.76] from this place
[5244.76 → 5246.44] prepared
[5246.44 → 5247.68] and equipped
[5247.68 → 5249.74] to live
[5249.74 → 5250.58] as people
[5250.58 → 5252.48] of the light.
[5255.28 → 5256.56] May your light
[5256.56 → 5258.10] shine through us
[5258.10 → 5259.04] today.
[5260.38 → 5261.46] May your light
[5261.46 → 5262.82] shine on us
[5262.82 → 5263.94] and in us
[5263.94 → 5265.40] and may that light
[5265.40 → 5266.94] radiate out of us
[5266.94 → 5267.74] as we go
[5267.74 → 5269.46] into this week.
[5271.12 → 5271.62] God,
[5271.70 → 5273.30] you are so good
[5273.30 → 5274.84] and help us
[5274.84 → 5275.84] today to know
[5275.84 → 5276.54] a little more
[5276.54 → 5277.40] of who you are
[5277.40 → 5278.54] and to live
[5278.54 → 5279.52] a little more
[5279.52 → 5280.86] as you have
[5280.86 → 5281.50] called us
[5281.50 → 5282.30] to live.
[5282.76 → 5283.76] In Jesus we pray.
[5284.32 → 5284.68] Amen.
[5284.68 → 5284.78] Amen.
[5284.78 → 5284.80] Amen.

[5323.34 → 5324.04] Amen.
[5324.98 → 5326.00] Amen.
[5326.00 → 5336.00] Robed in white apparel, washed in Jesus' blood
[5336.00 → 5345.80] Lay away in heaven with the Lamb of God
[5345.80 → 5357.88] Out of tribulation, death and Satan's hand
[5357.88 → 5366.64] They have been translated at the Lord's command
[5366.64 → 5375.68] In their hands they're holding palms of victory
[5375.68 → 5385.68] Hark the duvet chorus shouts triumphantly
[5385.68 → 5397.54] Unto God Almighty sitting on the throne
[5397.54 → 5407.54] And the Lamb victorious, be the praise of the Lord
[5407.54 → 5417.54] God has brought salvation, He did wondrous things
[5417.54 → 5427.54] Who shall not extol Thee, Holy King of kings
[5427.54 → 5442.26] As you go, go as those sent by God, commissioned by Him with the message of the gospel.
[5442.42 → 5446.98] Go as children of the light because God Himself goes with you.
[5447.30 → 5450.30] And so receive God's blessing for the journey ahead.
[5450.30 → 5453.92] God go before you to lead you.
[5454.30 → 5456.28] God go behind you to protect you.
[5456.64 → 5458.56] God go beneath you to support you.
[5458.90 → 5461.32] God go beside you to befriend you.
[5462.04 → 5463.30] Do not be afraid.
[5464.30 → 5466.20] Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[5466.34 → 5471.80] Do not be afraid, but go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
[5471.80 → 5473.14] Amen.
[5473.14 → 5473.34] Amen.
[5473.34 → 5495.52] Now unto the King eternal
[5495.52 → 5502.52] Unto the King immortal
[5502.52 → 5508.96] Unto the King invisible
[5508.96 → 5514.80] The only wise God
[5514.80 → 5521.52] The only wise God
[5521.52 → 5551.52] 
[5551.52 → 5558.52] The only wise God
[5558.52 → 5559.52] The only wise God
[5559.52 → 5561.52] The only wise God
[5561.52 → 5564.52] Oh unto the King
[5564.52 → 5568.52] The glory and honour
[5568.52 → 5572.52] Unto the King forever
[5572.52 → 5573.52] Unto the King
[5573.52 → 5577.52] Forever
[5577.52 → 5578.52] Unto the King
[5578.52 → 5579.52] The glory and honour
[5579.52 → 5581.52] Forever
[5581.52 → 5583.52] And ever

[5628.28 → 5629.50] Amen
[5629.50 → 5659.48] Thank you.
[5659.50 → 5689.48] Thank you.
[5689.50 → 5691.50] Thank you.

[6325.50 → 6326.50] I'm sorry.
[6326.50 → 6327.50] I'm sorry.
[6327.50 → 6328.50] I'm sorry.
[6328.50 → 6329.50] Yeah.
[6329.50 → 6330.50] I got a creative.
