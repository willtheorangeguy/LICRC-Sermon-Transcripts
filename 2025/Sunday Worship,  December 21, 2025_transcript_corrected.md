[385.00 → 387.00] Thank you.
[387.00 → 415.92] Today we light the candle of love
[415.92 → 420.92] Like the angels we see God's love revealed in the coming of Christ
[420.92 → 433.26] As this candle burns we remember
[433.26 → 435.30] Christ is love made visible
[445.92 → 459.92] Of the Father's love begotten
[459.92 → 464.84] Where the worlds began to be
[464.84 → 468.80] He is the found Omega
[468.80 → 473.80] He the source the ending he
[473.80 → 480.80] Of the things that are that have been
[480.80 → 484.80] And that future years shall see
[484.80 → 490.80] Evermore and evermore
[490.80 → 496.18] Oh that birth forever blessed
[496.18 → 502.22] When a virgin blessed with grace
[502.22 → 506.58] By the Holy Ghost conceiving
[506.58 → 511.80] Bore the Saviour of the race
[511.80 → 517.80] And obeyed the world's Redeemer
[517.80 → 523.26] First revealed his sacred face
[523.26 → 528.80] Evermore and evermore
[528.80 → 537.92] This is he who sees in old times
[537.92 → 542.74] Chanted of with one accord
[542.74 → 547.04] Whom the voices of the prophets
[547.04 → 552.90] Promised in their faithful word
[552.90 → 558.40] Now he shines the long expected
[558.40 → 563.76] Let creation praise its Lord
[563.76 → 568.90] Evermore and evermore
[568.90 → 575.78] Let the heights of heaven adore him
[575.78 → 580.78] Angel hosts his praises sing
[580.78 → 586.02] Thou will minions bow before him
[586.02 → 590.98] And extol our God and King
[590.98 → 596.46] Let no tongue on earth be silent
[596.46 → 601.50] Every voice in concert ring
[601.50 → 606.50] Evermore and evermore
[606.50 → 612.70] Christ to you with God the Father
[612.70 → 618.40] And the Spirit there shall be
[618.40 → 622.50] Him enchanted high thanksgiving
[622.50 → 627.50] And the shout of jubilee
[627.50 → 633.50] Honour, glory, and dominion
[633.50 → 637.50] And eternal victory
[637.50 → 642.50] Evermore and evermore
[642.50 → 657.50] O come, O come, O come, Emmanuel
[657.50 → 678.02] O come, O come, Emmanuel, and ransom captive Israel.
[678.02 → 693.02] That mourns in lowly exile near, until the Son of God appear.
[695.02 → 705.30] Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel shall come to thee.
[705.30 → 726.30] O Israel, O come, thou branch of Jesse's dead, unto thine all, and rescue them.
[726.30 → 740.30] From depths of hell your people save, and give them victory o'er the grave.
[740.30 → 756.24] Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.
[756.24 → 773.24] O come, O bright and morning star, and bring us comfort from afar.
[773.24 → 788.24] Dispel the shadows of the night, and turn our darkness into light.
[788.24 → 803.64] Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.
[803.64 → 821.02] Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.
[825.02 → 827.70] Join me in a prayer of confession.
[827.70 → 839.28] Lord Jesus Christ, we confess that we are willing to be loved, yet slow to love and return.
[840.04 → 845.32] We gladly receive your forgiveness, yet we struggle to forgive others.
[846.74 → 849.64] We reach out for your redeeming love.
[850.52 → 854.08] You hesitate, yet hesitate to follow you fully.
[854.08 → 861.64] In this season of Advent, forgive us for the ways we fail to respond to your grace.
[862.50 → 867.32] Come to us again, and by your mercy, teach us to receive you.
[868.04 → 870.88] With joy, like the shepherds and magi.
[871.56 → 873.86] In peace, like Mary and Joseph.
[874.90 → 878.08] Full of hope, like Elizabeth and Zachariah.
[878.36 → 882.06] And with love, as you have first loved us.
[882.06 → 885.50] Even so, come, Lord Jesus.
[886.18 → 886.50] Amen.
[886.50 → 886.62] Amen.
[886.62 → 892.44] Come, Lord Jesus.
[892.44 → 904.58] Come and comfort now my people
[904.58 → 909.96] Speak of peace, all says our God
[909.96 → 914.80] Comfort those who sit in darkness
[914.80 → 919.90] Throating under sorrows, Lord
[919.90 → 923.68] Cry out to Jerusalem
[923.68 → 929.04] Of the peace that waits for them
[929.04 → 933.52] Tell her that her sins I cover
[933.52 → 938.20] And her warfare now is over
[938.20 → 944.64] For the herald's voice is crying
[944.64 → 949.76] In the desert far and near
[949.76 → 953.54] Calling all to true repentance
[953.54 → 959.22] Since the kingdom now is here
[959.22 → 963.54] Hold that warning cry, obey
[963.54 → 967.54] Now prepare for God away
[967.54 → 972.48] Let the valleys rise to meet Him
[972.48 → 977.62] And the hills bow down to greet Him
[977.62 → 983.40] Then make straight what long was crooked
[983.40 → 988.24] Make the rougher places plain
[988.24 → 992.62] Let your hearts be true and humble
[992.62 → 997.50] As befits His holy name
[997.50 → 1001.08] For the glory of the Lord
[1001.08 → 1005.54] Now on earth is shed abroad
[1005.54 → 1010.30] And all flesh shall see the token
[1010.30 → 1014.60] That God's word is never broken
[1014.60 → 1035.58] Good morning everyone
[1035.58 → 1039.36] My name is Allison, and I'm one of the deacons
[1039.36 → 1040.72] Here at the church
[1040.72 → 1045.04] We are really grateful for the incredible support
[1045.04 → 1048.76] From all of you for the ministry and mission
[1048.76 → 1050.18] Of Langley Emmanuel
[1050.18 → 1053.40] Your faithful giving throughout the year
[1053.40 → 1055.56] Has supported ongoing ministries
[1055.56 → 1059.56] New initiatives, missions and outreach
[1059.56 → 1061.08] And faith formation
[1061.08 → 1064.26] For everyone from newborns to seniors
[1064.26 → 1065.80] In our church community
[1065.80 → 1069.94] We are currently 12% behind our budget
[1069.94 → 1070.94] For 2025
[1070.94 → 1074.68] That's roughly $75,000
[1074.68 → 1077.08] Needed by the end of the year
[1077.08 → 1078.36] To meet our goals
[1078.36 → 1080.50] What you give today
[1080.50 → 1082.68] And over the next week and a half
[1082.68 → 1085.24] Will help us finish the year well
[1085.24 → 1088.58] We see God's faithfulness
[1088.58 → 1090.40] Expressed through you all
[1090.40 → 1092.56] Thank you in advance
[1092.56 → 1093.86] For your generosity
[1093.86 → 1096.60] And for supporting the ongoing ministry
[1096.60 → 1099.02] And mission of our church family
[1099.02 → 1101.30] As always
[1101.30 → 1103.60] You can give the envelopes
[1103.60 → 1106.04] You can give through the envelopes
[1106.04 → 1106.74] In the seats
[1106.74 → 1108.74] By e-transfer
[1108.74 → 1110.04] Or online
[1110.04 → 1111.24] Today
[1111.24 → 1114.82] Any undesignated giving
[1114.82 → 1116.42] Will also go to the budget
[1116.42 → 1119.94] May what the Apostle Paul
[1119.94 → 1121.60] Says of the Corinthian church
[1121.60 → 1123.52] Be true of us here in our church
[1123.52 → 1127.02] Since you excel in everything
[1127.02 → 1128.24] In faith
[1128.24 → 1129.46] In speech
[1129.46 → 1130.70] In knowledge
[1130.70 → 1133.58] In complete earnestness
[1133.58 → 1136.42] And in the love we have kindled in you
[1136.42 → 1138.82] See that you also excel
[1138.82 → 1140.98] In this grace of giving
[1140.98 → 1144.08] From 2 Corinthians chapter 8
[1144.08 → 1170.76] How deep the Father's love for us
[1170.76 → 1175.72] How vast beyond all measure
[1175.72 → 1181.76] That he should give his only Son
[1181.76 → 1187.64] To make a wretch his treasure
[1187.64 → 1194.52] How great the pain of searing loss
[1194.52 → 1200.52] The Father turns his face away
[1200.52 → 1205.52] As wounds which bar the Chosen One
[1205.52 → 1211.40] Bring many sons to glory
[1211.40 → 1227.48] Behold the man upon a cross
[1227.48 → 1232.36] My sin upon his shoulders
[1232.36 → 1238.40] Ashamed I hear my walking voice
[1238.40 → 1244.40] Call out among the scoffers
[1244.40 → 1250.66] It was my sin that held him there
[1250.66 → 1255.72] Until it was accomplished
[1255.72 → 1262.56] His dying breath has brought me life
[1262.56 → 1267.56] I know that it is finished
[1267.56 → 1283.56] I will not boast in anything
[1283.56 → 1285.56] No gifts
[1285.56 → 1286.24] No gifts
[1286.24 → 1286.56] No power
[1286.56 → 1288.56] No wisdom
[1288.56 → 1289.56] No gifts
[1289.56 → 1290.56] No power
[1290.56 → 1291.56] No wisdom
[1291.56 → 1295.56] But I will boast in Jesus Christ
[1295.56 → 1300.56] His death and resurrection
[1300.56 → 1307.56] Why should I gain from his reward
[1307.56 → 1312.56] I cannot give an answer
[1312.56 → 1319.56] But this I know with all my heart
[1319.56 → 1324.56] His wounds have paid my ransom
[1324.56 → 1325.56] No wisdom
[1325.56 → 1326.56] No wisdom
[1326.56 → 1331.56] Why should I gain from his reward
[1331.56 → 1332.56] No wisdom
[1332.56 → 1334.56] Why should I gain from his reward
[1334.56 → 1335.56] I cannot give an answer
[1335.56 → 1336.56] Why should I gain from his reward
[1336.56 → 1337.56] I cannot give an answer
[1337.56 → 1342.56] But this I know with all my heart
[1342.56 → 1354.56] His wounds have paid my ransom
[1354.56 → 1362.56] Good morning
[1362.56 → 1365.56] I'd like to invite all the kids to come forward for Kids Corner
[1365.56 → 1368.56] If you are age 3 all the way up to grade 4
[1368.56 → 1371.56] You are invited to join us up here
[1371.56 → 1373.56] And then out in our classrooms
[1373.56 → 1377.56] As we learn more about the story of Christmas together
[1377.56 → 1379.56] Alright
[1387.56 → 1391.56] Okay to start I want you guys to imagine something for me
[1391.56 → 1394.56] This will be a little bit easier if you are someone who goes to school
[1394.56 → 1397.56] Like if you are in kindergarten or up
[1397.56 → 1400.56] So I want you to imagine that you hear the bell ring
[1400.56 → 1402.56] And so you run in from outside
[1402.56 → 1403.56] You are playing at recess
[1403.56 → 1405.56] And you run back to the door where you have to line up
[1405.56 → 1407.56] Your first one there
[1407.56 → 1409.56] And your teacher opens the door and says
[1409.56 → 1410.56] Guess what?
[1410.56 → 1413.56] We are not going to do any work this afternoon
[1413.56 → 1415.56] We are going to eat candy
[1415.56 → 1416.56] And we are going to play games
[1416.56 → 1419.56] And we are not going to do our spelling test or our math
[1419.56 → 1420.56] What would you do?
[1420.56 → 1422.56] You got a few choices
[1422.56 → 1424.56] Choice A
[1424.56 → 1425.56] Would you cry?
[1425.56 → 1427.56] Choice B
[1427.56 → 1430.56] Would you just line up like normal?
[1430.56 → 1431.56] Or
[1431.56 → 1432.56] Choice C
[1432.56 → 1435.56] Would you go run back to the playground
[1435.56 → 1436.56] And tell the rest of your class
[1436.56 → 1439.56] That you don't have to do any work that afternoon?
[1439.56 → 1440.56] What would you do?
[1440.56 → 1441.56] Who would do A?
[1441.56 → 1442.56] Who would cry?
[1442.56 → 1443.56] They are so sad
[1443.56 → 1444.56] Candy
[1444.56 → 1447.56] What about choice B?
[1447.56 → 1448.56] Would you just line up?
[1448.56 → 1449.56] How about choice C?
[1449.56 → 1451.56] Who would go and run and tell everybody else?
[1451.56 → 1457.56] I think that most of you would go run and tell everybody
[1457.56 → 1459.56] Hey guess what?
[1459.56 → 1461.56] We don't have to do any work today
[1461.56 → 1462.56] We are going to get candy
[1462.56 → 1463.56] We are going to play games
[1463.56 → 1465.56] Because it is good news
[1465.56 → 1466.56] Right?
[1466.56 → 1468.56] So today we are going to learn about
[1468.56 → 1469.56] Some messengers of God
[1469.56 → 1472.56] The angels who came and got to tell the shepherds
[1472.56 → 1475.56] The good news that baby Jesus was born
[1475.56 → 1477.56] And they didn't do it quietly
[1477.56 → 1478.56] They did it loudly
[1478.56 → 1480.56] They sang, and they proclaimed
[1480.56 → 1484.56] The good news that heaven had come down to earth
[1484.56 → 1486.56] Now when I think about when we proclaim
[1486.56 → 1488.56] Or we are excited to share something
[1488.56 → 1489.56] Especially when we are kids
[1489.56 → 1490.56] I think it is kind of loud
[1490.56 → 1491.56] Right?
[1491.56 → 1493.56] If you are excited to share something
[1493.56 → 1496.56] You might be clapping or cheering or shouting
[1496.56 → 1499.56] So today we are going to do a little
[1499.56 → 1500.56] Something a little differently
[1500.56 → 1502.56] We are going to start with the blessing
[1502.56 → 1506.56] And then before you sprint off
[1506.56 → 1508.56] Don't do that
[1508.56 → 1509.56] Come and see me first
[1509.56 → 1512.56] Because today we are going to leave
[1512.56 → 1515.56] Giving a demonstration of proclaiming
[1515.56 → 1517.56] And celebrating with a joyful noise
[1519.56 → 1522.56] What the good news of God is
[1522.56 → 1524.56] So we are going to stand up and do the blessing
[1524.56 → 1526.56] After the blessing don't run away
[1526.56 → 1528.56] Come up and see either me or Isla
[1528.56 → 1529.56] She is going to come up
[1529.56 → 1530.56] And I think you will know what to do
[1530.56 → 1531.56] With what we are going to give you
[1531.56 → 1534.56] But if you don't just try and make noise with it
[1534.56 → 1535.56] And that will work
[1555.56 → 1556.56] 轉 and love
[1556.56 → 1557.88] To theca Titan
[1565.56 → 1569.16] One is a massive
[1570.56 → 1572.56] That's good
[1576.56 → 1578.12] One is a huge
[1578.12 → 1578.56] That we understand
[1578.56 → 1582.68] It's our biggest
[1582.68 → 1612.66] Thank you.
[1612.68 → 1642.66] Thank you.
[1642.68 → 1644.68] Thank you.
[1644.68 → 1646.68] Thank you.
[1646.68 → 1648.68] Thank you.
[1648.68 → 1652.82] We'll be undergoing further testing in the weeks ahead, and we'll be praying for Linda
[1652.82 → 1654.78] and Neil who are dealing with this difficult news.
[1655.30 → 1657.38] So let's bow our heads.
[1657.38 → 1659.38] Thank you.
[1659.38 → 1661.38] Thank you.
[1661.38 → 1663.38] Thank you.
[1663.38 → 1665.38] Thank you.
[1665.38 → 1667.38] Thank you.
[1667.38 → 1669.38] Thank you.
[1669.38 → 1671.38] Thank you.
[1671.38 → 1673.38] Thank you.

[1846.48 → 1868.96] good morning everyone when you think of the Christmas season or when you think of what most people think
[1868.96 → 1876.96] of in the Christmas season what comes to mind I think for many of us it's what I'm going to call
[1877.76 → 1885.36] cutesy Christmas we think of hallmark movies about a small town girl returning home and running into a
[1886.00 → 1893.36] former high school acquaintance where time has been very kind to his face and his biceps we think about
[1893.36 → 1901.36] angel Christmas tree toppers with perfect curly locks and fluffy white wings we think of twinkling
[1901.36 → 1907.84] lights on a house that dance to the music of carol of the bells for some reason we think of garland and
[1907.84 → 1914.24] wreaths and colour coordinated Christmas trees that are set up to shift the mood in our house
[1914.24 → 1924.32] from regular chaotic to just like comfortable cozy we think of warm sweaters that are often hideous
[1924.32 → 1930.00] unless you've got one like mine which is beautiful, and you snuggle into them because they also provide
[1930.00 → 1936.16] a coziness as you sit on your couch when it's raining outside you think of piping hot chocolate and soft
[1936.16 → 1941.68] sugar cookies which are totally fine to consume in large quantities during this season because
[1941.68 → 1946.16] an old woman in a drink sweater once told me that the calories don't count right now because it's
[1946.16 → 1953.84] dark outside and new year's is still two years away or two weeks away and honestly I think for most of us
[1954.88 → 1962.24] we love that, and it's okay to love that because these little moments found in Christmas this cutesy
[1962.24 → 1969.36] Christmas brings little moments of relief little flashes of comfort
[1969.36 → 1977.52] we love stories where people are kind and problems are solvable and happiness is guaranteed after
[1977.52 → 1984.32] 90 minutes right before the final scene in the credits roll, and it's okay to find comfort and rest
[1984.32 → 1991.76] in this rainy season in a warm beverage and and and a comfortable sweater and re-watching die hard or
[1991.76 → 1998.00] we met in December for the 19th time which we met in December is one of the 24 new hallmark movies that
[1998.00 → 2005.68] came out this year which raises the total to over 400 hallmark Christmas movies
[2007.12 → 2008.08] that's not a joke
[2010.16 → 2014.08] that's crazy, but it speaks to something doesn't it
[2016.16 → 2018.88] it speaks to cozy cutesy Christmas
[2018.88 → 2029.04] and it's okay to like cutesy Christmas but let's be very honest cutesy Christmas
[2029.76 → 2038.24] only lets us escape for a moment because in real life most of our problems don't get resolved in an
[2038.24 → 2045.04] hour and a half or certainly with just a cup of hot chocolate or lounging around in our Edmonton Oilers
[2045.04 → 2048.08] christmas sweaters
[2048.08 → 2054.16] we live in a very polarized world full of suffering full of uncertainty full of exhaustion
[2056.08 → 2063.12] our hearts are restless and cutesy Christmas gives us a brief place to rest and to breathe, but it's brief
[2064.32 → 2065.76] because January lurks
[2065.76 → 2071.68] the thing is biblical Christmas is the opposite of cutesy
[2072.88 → 2075.12] biblical Christmas is disruptive
[2076.16 → 2077.20] it's dangerous
[2078.00 → 2079.12] it's cosmic
[2080.40 → 2086.96] and the love and the peace that biblical Christmas Christmas offers is not momentary it doesn't disappear
[2086.96 → 2088.32] when the decorations come down
[2089.28 → 2090.88] so today we're going to look
[2090.88 → 2096.24] uh we're going to continue sorry looking at the characters of Christmas we're going to focus on the angels
[2096.24 → 2102.40] this morning, and we're going to specifically look at a passage that portrays Christmas as anything but cutesy
[2103.28 → 2109.12] because the love of god isn't small it isn't sentimental it isn't temporary
[2109.12 → 2116.40] it's a love that breaks into the world at Christmas and changes everything and so if you've got your bibles with
[2116.40 → 2122.16] you please open it up right to the end we're going to skip all the way ahead to revelation 12
[2122.72 → 2128.40] and we're going to read revelation 12 verses 1 to 12. All right if you've got your bibles with you or your
[2128.40 → 2132.56] bible apps I encourage you keep those open because we are going to be jumping around from revelation
[2132.56 → 2135.36] to Luke's Christmas story and elsewhere as well
[2136.24 → 2137.76] but for now revelation 12
[2138.48 → 2140.56] verses 1 to 12 there we read this
[2140.56 → 2149.52] a great sign appeared in heaven a woman clothed with the sun with the moon under her feet and a crown
[2149.52 → 2155.60] of 12 stars on her head she was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth
[2156.80 → 2164.08] then another sign appeared in heaven an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven
[2164.08 → 2170.48] crowns on its head its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to earth
[2172.08 → 2177.92] the dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth so that it might devour the child
[2177.92 → 2185.76] the moment he was born she gave birth to a son a male child who will rule all the nations with an iron
[2185.76 → 2192.32] sceptre and her child was snatched up to god and to his throne the woman fled into the wilderness to a
[2192.32 → 2198.80] place prepared for her by god where she might be taken to taken care of for 1260 days
[2200.24 → 2207.28] then war broke out in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon and his
[2207.28 → 2213.44] angels fought back, but he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven the great dragon was
[2213.44 → 2221.92] hurled down that ancient serpent called the devil or Satan who leads the whole world astray he was
[2221.92 → 2230.64] hurled to the earth and his angels with him then I heard a loud voice in heaven say now have come the
[2230.64 → 2236.72] salvation and the power and the kingdom of our god and the authority of his messiah for the accuser of
[2236.72 → 2245.04] our brothers and sisters who accuse them before our god day and night has been hurled down they triumphed
[2245.04 → 2250.96] over him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony they did not love their lives so
[2250.96 → 2258.80] much as to shrink from death therefore rejoice you heavens and you who dwell in them but woe to the earth
[2258.80 → 2266.08] and the sea because the devil has gone down to you, he is filled with fury because he knows that his time is
[2266.08 → 2269.20] is short the word of the lord
[2272.32 → 2280.48] now I know that that's a weird Christmas passage but that is the picture of what Christmas is about
[2282.16 → 2288.32] what we just read does not necessarily reflect one moment in time mind you's not simply the Christmas
[2288.32 → 2296.96] story, but it's a snapshot of god's entire redemption plan all of human history portrayed here in
[2297.60 → 2304.08] apocalyptic literature now they say a picture is worth a thousand words which makes me think then that
[2304.08 → 2309.20] the gift that you send your friends is worth like a million words because it's moving but that means
[2309.20 → 2315.20] that this passage here in revelation has got to be worth a billion, and we don't have time for all of
[2315.20 → 2322.00] those words today, but we are going to break this text down in a little bit however I can say with
[2322.00 → 2329.92] certainty that I have yet to see a hallmark Christmas movie about a dragon fighting angels in the stars
[2329.92 → 2342.40] whilst trying to consume a baby this passage is anything but cutesy but Christmas isn't cutesy Christmas is a
[2342.40 → 2350.64] cosmic invasion see Christmas isn't just sentimental joy to the world silent night peace on earth that's
[2350.64 → 2357.76] for sure part of it, but we cannot limit what happened on Christmas to simply the gentle and lowly
[2359.20 → 2368.48] our text shows us that Christmas is about wartime love about heaven coming down to earth to reclaim what was
[2368.48 → 2376.56] lost, and we know that Christmas is not god entering a peaceful world we know in our heart of hearts this is
[2376.56 → 2386.08] true because the world we live in is not peaceful no Christmas is about god invading enemy territory
[2387.28 → 2396.08] and the angels in the Christmas story are a picture of that they remind us of that the angels are evidence of
[2396.08 → 2406.08] this bigger story which we so often fail to see when we tame Christmas into something cutesy the angels
[2406.08 → 2414.32] break into this story to show us how cosmic it truly is the angels refuse to let Christmas stay comfortable
[2414.32 → 2420.80] because whenever they appear they announce a colossal story where heaven and earth are at stake
[2420.80 → 2430.96] if you've got your bibles flip with me to Luke 1 26 to 38 in this story we've got Gabriel an angel of god
[2430.96 → 2438.64] who appears to Mary all right and Gabriel says to Mary this he says greetings you who are highly favoured
[2438.64 → 2445.84] the lord is with you do not be afraid Mary you have found favour with god you will conceive and give birth
[2445.84 → 2454.56] to a son, and you are to call him Jesus now hear this he will be great and will be called the son of the
[2454.56 → 2461.92] most high the lord god will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over Jacob's
[2461.92 → 2470.80] descendants forever his kingdom will never end he will be son of the most high he will get the throne of
[2470.80 → 2482.64] David he will reign forever his kingdom will never end cosmic Christmas this is a kingdom altering
[2482.64 → 2491.68] declaration see Gabriel's presence here in the story reminds us that god is already active here even
[2491.68 → 2500.00] before Mary says yes Gabriel's not asking permission no he is telling Mary what's going to happen
[2501.36 → 2503.20] god is already active and moving
[2505.36 → 2508.16] but do we remember Mary's response her initial response
[2509.68 → 2516.32] she says how will this be because I am a virgin now in fairness that is a fair question to ask
[2516.32 → 2521.52] and I don't want to ridicule Mary here she's speaking to Gabriel this magnificent angel who's
[2521.52 → 2527.76] just popped into her house who's telling her a bunch of wild stuff many of us would have responded
[2527.76 → 2532.40] similarly and I think I'm being very charitable here because I suspect there would be a lot more
[2532.40 → 2540.16] screaming and a lot more cowering in this room, but it's worth noticing that Mary's confusion here
[2540.88 → 2548.80] mirrors our own blindness that we often have to god's big story at that moment
[2548.80 → 2556.40] Mary sees inconvenience she sees risk and confusion and no logical way forward
[2556.40 → 2563.36] heaven though through Gabriel is proclaiming that the redemption plan
[2563.36 → 2570.00] is unfolding Gabriel already knows what earth has yet to understand
[2571.60 → 2576.72] all right another example comes a chapter later Luke 2 18 to 14 there shepherds are in the field they're
[2576.72 → 2582.48] watching their sheep and an angel appears and says this do not be afraid I bring you good news that will
[2582.48 → 2590.56] cause great joy for all the people today the town of David a saviour has been born to you, he is the messiah
[2590.56 → 2597.68] of the lord this will be assigned to you, you will find a baby wrapped in clothes and lying in a manger
[2597.68 → 2606.00] suddenly a great company of the heavenly hosts appear with the angel praising god and saying glory to god in
[2606.00 → 2610.40] the highest heaven and on earth peace to those on whom his favour rests
[2613.36 → 2620.96] now as josh reminded us josh reminded us of last week the shepherds are an unseen outcast people
[2622.08 → 2629.20] and yet they're the ones who are standing out in the field when heaven itself erupts open into song
[2630.88 → 2634.88] notice what's happening here don't soften this the angels aren't bringing peace
[2636.00 → 2643.84] they're bringing brightness and loudness and noise and worship just like the kids leaving this room
[2643.84 → 2644.16] today
[2646.96 → 2649.84] the shepherds were terrified
[2652.72 → 2658.08] the angels are announcing the peace they're not bringing the peace, but they're announcing the peace
[2658.08 → 2665.28] that god has already brought into the world by sending his son here heaven once again comes down to
[2665.28 → 2671.52] earth an earth that sees darkness and fear and silence because they've been waiting for this
[2671.52 → 2678.40] messiah for a long time but these angels they see the big picture they see victory in the form of this
[2678.40 → 2681.36] baby, and they can't help but sing
[2683.84 → 2689.68] and then our text today revelation 12 it completely pulls back the curtain and shows us what's really
[2689.68 → 2694.80] happening behind the Christmas story see a lot of revelation is a vision that john sees and here
[2694.80 → 2700.64] john sees a woman a child and a dragon, and it's not a puzzle that he has to solve, but it's a picture
[2700.64 → 2706.64] that he must understand the woman, and again we're going to hum through this a little bit we could have a
[2706.64 → 2713.60] series on this 12 these 12 verses, but the woman here represents god's people through whom the messiah
[2713.60 → 2721.52] and the child is Jesus the promised king who is born he's threatened that he's ultimately exalted
[2721.52 → 2726.88] onto god's throne and the dragon is Satan doing everything he can to stop god's work
[2728.40 → 2729.44] what's amazing
[2730.96 → 2737.68] is that the dragon fails the child isn't defeated which we know this story he's victorious
[2737.68 → 2755.28] that's why a war breaks out Satan is cast down not because he's weak but because Christ wins
[2756.16 → 2760.40] and while this picture and revelation of god's redemption plan throughout all time
[2761.84 → 2766.00] that's what this picture is god's redemption plan throughout all time
[2766.00 → 2773.76] the birth of this baby both in revelation and in the gospels is the turning point of this plan
[2776.00 → 2785.04] verse 10 of our text announces it clearly it says now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our god
[2788.80 → 2792.88] Christmas is not the beginning of the battle
[2792.88 → 2802.64] Christmas is the moment that heaven declares the outcome that's why the angels have to sing
[2805.36 → 2813.20] now the dragon is still threatening, but he's defeated he still rages, but his time is short
[2813.20 → 2819.12] c.s lewis says uh that the devil the dragon in this text is dangerous but doomed
[2819.12 → 2825.20] but that's why life can still feel hard even after Christ has come
[2827.20 → 2831.68] revelation 12 reminds us of this when we look at Christmas we may only see a baby
[2832.40 → 2840.80] but heaven sees a victory and even when we can't see it all heaven is fighting to secure us in the love of god
[2840.80 → 2844.88] the love of god
[2847.52 → 2854.56] while sometimes we're guilty of seeing Christmas as mostly cutesy I think we're also guilty of
[2855.44 → 2863.36] often having a narrow view of love rather than the expansive view of love like a passage of like revelation 12 portrays
[2863.36 → 2868.80] I think now cultural love ends up playing out pretty shallow
[2869.44 → 2876.32] love in our world is often is measured it's often calculated it's exchanged between people
[2876.32 → 2881.92] and I'm not just talking about romantic love like a marriage or dating relationships it fits here for sure
[2882.48 → 2885.92] but all relationships friendships siblings relationships with parents even
[2885.92 → 2887.84] to be honest
[2889.84 → 2895.60] and an underlying principle of narrow cultural love is transactional in nature and I know that that sounds
[2895.60 → 2899.92] crass but I do think we've all seen love play out that way before
[2901.20 → 2902.08] if you think about it
[2903.76 → 2910.56] even when done for other’s sake for example love is often subconsciously undergirded with a transactional
[2910.56 → 2917.28] aspect I love so I give whether that's time or energy or gifts or words or whatever
[2918.00 → 2921.92] they feel something from that which makes me feel good
[2923.20 → 2927.12] I give you feel I feel good we're happy
[2928.80 → 2931.52] and I want to be careful because in some ways this is just
[2931.52 → 2937.44] natural loving someone does require giving of ourselves and in many ways and then in often times when
[2937.44 → 2943.60] love is received by someone well it does feel good it makes us happy but what happens when those
[2943.60 → 2949.76] transactions start to fail what happens when that transactional love
[2951.12 → 2958.00] stops feeling good what happens when life gets hard and the giving slows down or the returns aren't
[2958.00 → 2964.64] received as well as they once were what happens when we realize that what we've invested in
[2964.64 → 2972.32] the relationship that we've invested in no longer seems to be paying the same dividends that it once
[2972.32 → 2972.56] did
[2972.56 → 2980.16] and I'm sure we can all think of families or friendships or even marriages that have fallen apart
[2980.16 → 2983.28] because of the line well I just don't love them anymore
[2985.92 → 2990.80] so often the thing that supports that line the thing that that is the underlying truth
[2990.80 → 2998.32] of the I don't love them anymore is this is I wasn't getting anything from them anymore
[2999.92 → 3005.84] I wasn't being treated the same way I wasn't feeling the same way I once did because the returns weren't
[3005.84 → 3015.44] coming see when love is safe when love is happy, and it's based mainly on our feelings narrow love
[3015.44 → 3023.68] love can end relationships can fall apart love becomes narrow when it's only cutesy
[3024.80 → 3030.40] it becomes about our own feelings and what we get and what we receive
[3032.40 → 3036.56] narrow cultural love at the root of it is selfish
[3036.56 → 3046.00] but biblical love is different biblical love is expansive biblical love is selfless
[3046.80 → 3052.64] biblical love pushes back against this narrow view of love by showing us something far bigger than
[3052.64 → 3059.28] sentiment or momentary happiness it's a love that suffers it's a love that risks it's a love that
[3059.28 → 3064.96] sacrifice is a love that doesn't always feel good but remains faithful
[3067.12 → 3071.76] greater love gives everything for one another first john or sorry not first john regular john
[3071.76 → 3080.24] the Gospel of John 15 13 says this greater love has no one than this to lay down one's life for one's friends
[3080.24 → 3092.32] when we look at Christmas from only the earth's perspective we see a little baby in a manger
[3093.36 → 3099.28] surrounded by cattle and sheep on a clear winter's night which was so sweet we see this picture
[3101.04 → 3109.92] right we see this picture with sheep bowing down and haloed parents we see angels bringing doves and that
[3109.92 → 3112.00] olive branch from Noah's ark for some reason
[3115.52 → 3119.76] we see camels and donkeys and cows that are for sure going to break into song at any moment
[3123.76 → 3124.72] but if we stay here
[3128.40 → 3130.32] we miss the depth of what god is doing
[3132.64 → 3139.76] when we hear what the angels are really announcing Christmas stops being small and cutesy
[3139.92 → 3149.76] and becomes what it truly is god's decisive victory over sin and death that's why apocalyptic
[3149.76 → 3156.16] scripture is here for us to pull back that curtain and to articulate this big picture of god's redemption
[3156.16 → 3162.24] plan that needed Christ's birth to take place the turning point of the story Christmas love is not
[3162.24 → 3169.20] sentimental it's incarnational it's not cutesy it's cosmic it's not selfish it's sacrificial
[3169.20 → 3181.52] it is this expansive love of god that finally calms our restless hearts offering not just brief relief
[3182.32 → 3192.24] but eternal hope in Jesus our restless hearts that crave the calm are calmed only in the eternal love
[3192.24 → 3200.08] and hope of Jesus Christ that's the message that's the angels bring to us on Christmas that's the big idea
[3200.08 → 3209.84] when our hearts are restless when we need relief when all we see is struggle the angels remind us that god's love
[3209.84 → 3211.04] love wins
[3215.12 → 3220.96] because we can trust that god's love ultimately wins over everything that makes our hearts restless
[3223.04 → 3227.68] we can also trust that his love meets us right in the middle of our struggles
[3229.12 → 3234.96] I know there's been times in my life where god has felt far away I remember a season of my life actually where
[3234.96 → 3241.92] everything on the surface was going really well but I was not we had just had our second daughter we
[3241.92 → 3246.08] were going to be moving into a new house that we had just bought in Langley the one we currently live
[3246.08 → 3251.28] in actually we were no longer vacant here at church so that season had ended, and we're coming out of that I was
[3251.28 → 3256.24] working decently well with our new pastor and I wasn't even in school yet so that stress wasn't even on
[3256.24 → 3265.36] the horizon, and yet I was having a hard time getting up in the morning see life was tiring and through
[3265.36 → 3271.84] some lies that the devil was whispering in my ear I was feeling very ill-equipped and unprepared and
[3271.84 → 3279.76] often useless and worst of all god seemed real far away from me like he wasn't there at all and as a
[3279.76 → 3284.00] youth pastor I was making it inappropriately personal
[3286.48 → 3290.96] later I learned that I was dealing actually with paternal postpartum depression but I also learned
[3290.96 → 3297.60] that even though I felt like god wasn't part of my struggles his love for me never waned
[3298.56 → 3304.80] eventually I remembered that his love conquers all and he was with me all along and yeah I've had
[3304.80 → 3309.28] other seasons since then where my mental health has dipped but again through the love of community
[3309.28 → 3313.68] through the love of family through the love of friends and counsellors and most importantly the
[3313.68 → 3321.76] eternal love of our saviour Jesus Christ I am more aware than his love for me his love for you
[3322.56 → 3332.72] his love for the entire cosmos has never failed because Jesus love is one even when our lives feel broken
[3332.72 → 3342.24] he is with us in our struggles he's aware of what we're going through because he created us, and he knows
[3342.24 → 3343.76] us better than we even will
[3346.00 → 3353.68] and he knows what it means to struggle because he came down from his throne and he took on flesh
[3355.20 → 3361.68] he was tempted, and he mourned, and he grieved, and he was tormented and tortured, and he felt what it was
[3361.68 → 3368.88] like to be alone and abandoned and depressed and hurting and our saviour Jesus Christ came down from
[3368.88 → 3374.32] his throne in heaven and became a baby for us all he lived the life that we fail to live each and every
[3374.32 → 3381.36] day, and he died a death that we deserve because we're the ones who's living the lives of sin not him
[3382.40 → 3387.92] but he took on the weight of sin and brokenness on his shoulders with him on the cross, and he bore our
[3387.92 → 3394.00] suffering and shame and though it seemed like the dragon consumed him three days later he rose again
[3394.00 → 3400.48] from the grave, and he defeated that dragon once and for all, and now he is exalted in the heavens where
[3400.48 → 3408.00] he will one day come again to usher in his kingdom god's love wins
[3408.00 → 3417.92] the battles we face are but moments in the light of the eternal glory we find in Jesus now I don't
[3417.92 → 3425.28] want to minimize what we go through because I know that life kicks us pretty hard but hear how Paul describes
[3425.28 → 3432.56] the seasons of struggle we face he says this in second Corinthians 4 16 to 17 he says therefore we do not
[3432.56 → 3440.64] lose heart though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day for our
[3440.64 → 3449.04] light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all
[3451.60 → 3458.80] Paul can call our struggles light and momentary because god's love has conquered them all
[3458.80 → 3468.32] and we will receive an eternal glory that far outweighs anything we will experience here on earth
[3470.24 → 3478.72] the angels sing of that glory that overcomes our hardest hardships that's the victorious love of
[3478.72 → 3484.40] Christ that's why Christmas is more than just cutesy it's cosmic and that's why the angels are not simply
[3484.40 → 3490.96] asking Mary and the shepherds to think about helping out they are declaring victory over sin and death
[3490.96 → 3497.04] forever and erupting into song because all is well
[3500.24 → 3508.88] revelation 12 paints that picture of victory, but our battles do still continue the angels break into song
[3508.88 → 3515.52] because they know how the story ends, but we can find rest for our restless hearts because we know the
[3515.52 → 3522.96] end of the story too in a few days we celebrate Christmas this turning point of god's redemption plan
[3522.96 → 3531.84] Christmas day and as we celebrate we're called to march ahead living out this selfless love for others
[3532.80 → 3537.84] when we see the bigger story when we grasp the ending love becomes not something that's passive or
[3537.84 → 3547.28] transactional, but it moves us to stand and to act and to endure in this battle that is already guaranteed
[3548.16 → 3554.88] it's already won we are called to be courageous in love as we enter into the battle for people's hearts
[3556.56 → 3562.40] but we enter that battle with a different mindset than most see the scriptures are clear god doesn't
[3562.40 → 3569.52] fight with the enemy's weapons Satan's not defeated by power or force or fear and the kingdom of god is
[3569.52 → 3576.48] not advanced by domination or intimidation Paul reminds us of this to that the weapons that we fight are
[3576.48 → 3582.64] not the weapons of the world second Corinthians 10 3 to 4 says for though we live in the world we do not wage
[3582.64 → 3589.92] war as the world does the weapons we fight with are not weapons of the world evil is overcome
[3589.92 → 3599.76] in a far more surprising way through self-giving sacrificial love that's the kind of love that we're
[3599.76 → 3605.12] talking about here at Christmas where god doesn't arrive with an army, but he arrives as a baby
[3607.76 → 3612.96] this matters deeply in a world marked by polarization and division
[3612.96 → 3621.28] when tensions rise it is tempting even for us as Christians to reach for those same tools that
[3621.28 → 3631.52] the world uses to secure supposed peace we like to draw sharper lines to dig our heels in but to cast
[3631.52 → 3639.60] ourselves as victims or try to dress up worldly power as something holy we do this in the conversations
[3639.60 → 3645.12] we have and the petitions we sign and the chat rooms we're a part of and the social media posts we make
[3646.16 → 3649.44] but those tools have never brought lasting peace
[3651.20 → 3655.36] at best they manage conflict at worst they deepen it
[3657.52 → 3664.56] putting Christian war paint on for an issue doesn't make it a holy war it just makes the conflict loud
[3664.56 → 3675.52] our battles must look different because Jesus won the war differently we're called to fight but not
[3675.52 → 3683.20] with fists clenched in anger or voices raised in fear we fight with courage shaped by love and humility
[3683.76 → 3689.52] with truth spoken in gentleness and with love willing to suffer for the sake of others
[3689.52 → 3697.92] like the child in the manger god loves god's love sorry enters the world quietly vulnerably and
[3697.92 → 3706.56] persistently and that is still the way his victory is made visible today so we can enter the battle without
[3706.56 → 3714.32] fear, and we can enter the battle with calm hearts and courageous confidence that the word of god will speak
[3714.32 → 3722.16] because Christ's love for us and what he accomplished we are invited into that battle but not as heroes or saviours
[3722.16 → 3723.20] we have one already
[3725.68 → 3734.00] but we're brought into battle as witnesses of our loving saviour so we can go declare Jesus as the brighter
[3734.00 → 3742.24] and bringer of love and the saviour of the world we can move forward after this Christmas after the trees are down
[3742.24 → 3749.52] and the hallmark movies switch from Christmas to Valentine's Day we can enter into the January months
[3750.08 → 3756.72] confident that our restless hearts can be calmed because god's love has won
[3758.72 → 3765.68] so again go ahead enjoy your hot chocolate enjoy your Christmas decorations enjoy that classic hallmark hit
[3765.68 → 3772.88] Christmas under wraps spelled with a w isn't that cute hallmark always knocks it out of the park
[3775.52 → 3785.28] but let's please remember that it is only in the love of Jesus that our restless hearts find true
[3785.84 → 3793.44] eternal relief this cosmic eternal forever love that has won the victory
[3793.44 → 3800.64] and in our world that is full of anxiety and polarity and chaos let's be agents of love
[3801.76 → 3806.64] and join Christ in that battle for his kingdom amen let's pray
[3812.56 → 3813.28] god in heaven
[3815.36 → 3819.04] we are days away from celebrating the birth of your son Jesus Christ
[3819.04 → 3826.64] and lord we so often take this season as a time of reflection and a time of rest and lord those
[3826.64 → 3836.16] those are good things, but god please press upon our hearts the magnitude of what Christmas actually is
[3837.28 → 3842.00] god we pray that we are all to see the truth that we don't need to escape the world
[3842.00 → 3848.96] into a cutesy Christmas to find relief that we don't find relief from escaping our world at all but we
[3848.96 → 3851.12] find relief because you entered our world
[3853.44 → 3857.92] we thank you for Christmas we thank you for humbling yourself
[3860.56 → 3861.84] and entering this place
[3864.40 → 3865.84] and god most of all we thank you
[3865.84 → 3872.64] for your life death resurrection and ascension that we know the victory has been won may we be
[3872.64 → 3877.84] agents of that love in this world that you have placed us in we pray this in your son's precious and
[3877.84 → 3879.84] holy name amen
[3895.84 → 3906.64] Witch 19
[3906.64 → 3908.00] cancer
[3908.00 → 3918.24] holy
[3918.24 → 3924.00] is
[3924.00 → 3937.40] Underneath me, all around me, is the current of thy love.
[3937.40 → 3950.40] Leading onward, leading onward, to thy glorious rest above.
[3950.40 → 3966.40] O the deep, deep love of Jesus, spread His praise from shore to shore.
[3966.40 → 3980.78] How He loves us, ever loves us, changes never, nevermore.
[3980.78 → 3994.78] How He watches for His loved ones, died to call Him on His own.
[3995.42 → 4008.38] How for them, He's interceding, watches o'er them from the throne.
[4008.38 → 4024.38] O the deep, deep love of Jesus, love of every love of best.
[4024.38 → 4031.38] This an ocean, that's the blessing.
[4032.62 → 4038.38] This a haven, sweet of rest.
[4039.58 → 4052.38] O the deep, deep love of Jesus, this a heaven of man to me.
[4052.38 → 4059.88] And it lifts me up to glory.
[4060.48 → 4067.38] For it lifts me up to Thee.
[4067.38 → 4078.82] As we go from this place, I want to invite you all to stick around afterwards.
[4078.96 → 4082.02] We'll have some refreshments out there in the foyer and the sanctuary as well.
[4082.24 → 4087.48] And if you need prayer today, there are going to be prayer people available here at the front and elsewhere.
[4087.48 → 4089.18] Well, they'll have yellow tags on.
[4089.28 → 4093.14] Please do go to them for prayer or turn to your neighbour and ask them to pray for you.
[4093.18 → 4094.68] I'm sure they would be happy to do so.
[4095.32 → 4099.76] But as we go from this place into this final week before Christmas,
[4099.76 → 4103.12] I invite you to all receive God's parting blessing.
[4104.32 → 4106.72] The Lord bless you and keep you.
[4107.40 → 4110.54] The Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[4110.96 → 4115.10] The Lord turn his face toward you and give you his peace.
[4115.52 → 4117.64] And all of God's people said, Amen.
[4117.64 → 4117.78] Amen.
[4117.78 → 4144.98] Should nothing of our efforts
[4144.98 → 4149.88] and no legacy survive
[4149.88 → 4155.04] unless the Lord does raise the house
[4155.04 → 4159.38] in vain its builders strive
[4159.38 → 4164.54] to you who boast tomorrow's gain
[4164.54 → 4168.90] tell me what is your life
[4168.90 → 4172.54] a mist that vanishes
[4172.54 → 4178.38] at dawn all glory be to Christ

[4183.30 → 4187.82] all glory be to Christ
[4187.82 → 4192.86] His rule and reign will ever sing

[4202.56 → 4208.60] His kingdom come on earth as is above
[4208.60 → 4214.38] who is Himself our daily bread
[4214.38 → 4218.84] praise Him the Lord of love
[4218.84 → 4223.80] let living water satisfy
[4223.80 → 4228.38] the thirsty without price
[4228.38 → 4233.46] we'll take a cup of kindness yet
[4233.46 → 4237.88] all glory be to Christ
[4237.88 → 4242.88] all glory be to Christ our King

[4252.44 → 4257.64] all glory be to Christ
[4257.64 → 4262.92] when on the day the great
[4262.92 → 4268.40] I am the faithful and the true
[4268.40 → 4272.86] the Lamb who was for sinners
[4272.86 → 4277.48] slain is making all things new
[4277.48 → 4282.44] behold our God shall live with us
[4282.44 → 4287.04] and be our steadfast light
[4287.04 → 4292.00] and we shall bear His people be
[4292.00 → 4296.40] all glory be to Christ
[4296.40 → 4301.44] all glory be to Christ our King
[4301.44 → 4306.44] all glory be to Christ
[4306.44 → 4310.44] His rule and reign will ever sing

[4320.44 → 4322.44] all glory be to Christ
[4322.44 → 4329.44] His rule and reign will ever sing
