[0.00 --> 5.70]  one of the pastors here. Today's a special service in our midst as we're joined by
[5.70 --> 11.30]  Adult and Teen Challenge, and they're going to share a little bit of their life and story and
[11.30 --> 17.24]  God's work with them a little bit later in our service. And so we're going to look forward to
[17.24 --> 21.60]  that and anticipate that. Before we begin, we have a couple announcements to make. And so,
[21.70 --> 26.82]  Paul, why don't you come up? And while Paul's coming up, I just want to inform everyone that
[26.82 --> 34.56]  next Sunday, which is Palm Sunday, after our worship, we're going to have a lunch gathering
[34.56 --> 41.68]  here to listen to the stories from our Mexico mission team. And so over the last spring break,
[41.78 --> 49.32]  we had a team that went down to Mexico and did some work there and saw God at work in their lives
[49.32 --> 53.78]  there. And so we're going to hear their stories next week following our worship together. More
[53.78 --> 59.60]  details for that will be in the midweek memo and e-bulletin and on social media and the like. So
[59.60 --> 72.04]  keep your eyes open for that. Paul? So, whoa, that was loud. Later on this year, this guy is going to
[72.04 --> 79.58]  complete his studies, which means he's going to become an ordained pastor, fully ordained.
[79.58 --> 94.34]  Tuesday night, this coming Tuesday night at seven o'clock. I have to think there for a second. Yes. Yeah.
[94.60 --> 102.08]  Seven o'clock. We invite you all to come here to have a town hall. And we want to discuss how
[102.08 --> 106.22]  that plan going forward is good. We want to hear from you. The council wants to hear from you
[106.22 --> 114.82]  how we go forward with that process. So invite you to come here on Tuesday night, seven o'clock. Be there.
[121.82 --> 129.42]  Rolling through just two more quick announcements. One, after service today, youth coffee is happening
[129.42 --> 135.86]  at the Rollamans House. And so youth, if you are part of our youth program or you're wondering about
[135.86 --> 141.94]  what that might be like, join and head over to the Rollamans House for coffee. Rollamans, there you go.
[142.38 --> 148.46]  Kevin can also tell you where you need to be and how you can get there. And then lastly, just a quick
[148.46 --> 158.48]  reminder that April is treat tag month. Thank you. Here at Langley Emanuel. And so I know some of you
[158.48 --> 164.08]  have already received little treat bags and the like. And so keep that up. Keep that going.
[164.76 --> 171.26]  You can again check out our YouTube channel or in the e-bulletin, midweek memo, social media for more
[171.26 --> 179.68]  details on that together. I think that's it. Yeah? Okay. Why don't we stand together and we can be
[179.68 --> 183.40]  ushered into God's presence in our worship this morning.
[183.40 --> 191.60]  Amen. I invite you to receive God's greeting as he speaks over us today. And then following God's
[191.60 --> 196.74]  greeting, invite you to turn to those around you that you might welcome them into worship as well.
[197.00 --> 206.42]  Receive the greeting of God. Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ,
[206.42 --> 212.20]  Son, and our Savior, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[236.42 --> 264.62]  Our call to worship today comes from Psalm 89. I will sing of the Lord's great love forever. With my mouth, I will make your faithfulness known through all generations.
[264.62 --> 270.38]  I will declare that your love stands firm forever, that you have established your faithfulness in heaven itself.
[271.26 --> 276.40]  Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne. Love and faithfulness go before you.
[277.08 --> 281.86]  Blessed are those who have learned to acclaim you, who walk in the light of your presence, Lord.
[282.32 --> 285.84]  They rejoice in your name all day long. They celebrate your righteousness.
[286.50 --> 291.02]  For you are their glory and strength, and by your favor you exalt our horn.
[291.02 --> 295.02]  Praise be to the Lord forever. Amen and Amen.
[321.02 --> 339.24]  Great is thy faithfulness, O God my Father.
[339.24 --> 348.08]  There is no shadow of turning with me.
[348.08 --> 356.78]  Thou changest not, thy compassions may fail not.
[356.78 --> 364.86]  As thou hast been, thou forever wilt be.
[364.86 --> 373.86]  Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[373.86 --> 397.86]  Lord unto me.
[397.86 --> 402.06]  power of Thy Spirit.
[402.06 --> 409.68]  Summer and winter and springtime and harvest.
[409.74 --> 417.46]  Sun, moon, and stars to their courses above.
[418.12 --> 425.58]  Joined with all nature in mechanical witness.
[425.58 --> 434.32]  To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.
[435.28 --> 443.06]  Great is Thy faithfulness, great is Thy faithfulness.
[443.68 --> 450.52]  Morning by morning new mercies I see.
[450.52 --> 459.12]  All I have needed Thy hand and provided.
[460.38 --> 468.34]  Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
[471.28 --> 479.12]  Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth.
[479.12 --> 487.72]  Thy own dear presence to cheer and to guide.
[488.96 --> 496.34]  Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow.
[497.80 --> 505.44]  Blessings all mine with ten thousand days died.
[505.44 --> 514.04]  Great is Thy faithfulness, great is Thy faithfulness.
[515.12 --> 522.04]  Morning by morning new mercies I see.
[523.82 --> 531.44]  All I have needed Thy hand, God, Lord, I am.
[531.44 --> 539.12]  Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, I am.
[539.12 --> 550.66]  Thanks for active,ください.
[550.66 --> 551.80]  Thank bodies, Lord, I am.
[551.80 --> 567.04]  Let the King of my heart be the mountain where I run.
[567.04 --> 573.18]  The mountain I drink from, holy is my song.
[573.96 --> 580.22]  Let the King of my heart be the shadow where I hide.
[580.22 --> 586.20]  The blessing for my life, holy is my song.
[586.58 --> 610.20]  You are good, good, oh, you are good, good, oh, you are good, good.
[610.22 --> 619.08]  Oh, let the King of my heart be the way inside my sails.
[619.08 --> 625.08]  The anchor in the waves, holy is my song.
[625.48 --> 631.84]  Let the King of my heart be the fire inside my veins.
[631.84 --> 637.94]  The echo of my days, holy is my song.
[637.94 --> 649.94]  You are good, good, oh, you are good, good, oh.
[649.94 --> 655.80]  Oh, you are good, good, oh.
[655.80 --> 662.80]  Oh, you are good, good, oh.
[662.80 --> 670.80]  You are never gonna let, never gonna let me down.
[670.80 --> 679.66]  You are never gonna let, never gonna let me down.
[679.66 --> 688.52]  You are never gonna let, never gonna let me down.
[688.52 --> 700.52]  You are never gonna let, never gonna let, never gonna let me down.
[700.52 --> 710.52]  You are never gonna let, never gonna let, never gonna let me down.
[710.52 --> 714.52]  You are never gonna let, never gonna let me down.
[714.52 --> 724.52]  You are good, never gonna let, never gonna let, never gonna let, never gonna let me down.
[724.52 --> 726.52]  Oh, you are good, oh.
[726.52 --> 731.52]  Oh, you are good, good, oh.
[731.52 --> 739.52]  Oh, you are good, good, oh.
[739.52 --> 765.52]  You are never gonna let, never gonna let, never gonna let me down.
[765.52 --> 784.26]  When the night is holding on to me
[784.26 --> 789.60]  God is holding on
[789.60 --> 797.48]  When the night is holding on to me
[797.48 --> 802.96]  God is holding on
[802.96 --> 804.62]  I'm watching this again
[804.62 --> 805.34]  Amen
[805.34 --> 818.84]  Reading from the book of Mark 8
[818.84 --> 820.60]  Verse 31 to 38
[820.60 --> 824.48]  Jesus then began to teach them
[824.48 --> 827.00]  That the Son of Man must suffer many things
[827.00 --> 829.38]  And be rejected by the elders
[829.38 --> 830.56]  The chief priests
[830.56 --> 832.14]  And the teachers of the law
[832.14 --> 834.16]  And that he must be killed
[834.16 --> 836.24]  And after three days rise again
[836.24 --> 838.80]  He spoke plainly about this
[838.80 --> 840.50]  And Peter took him aside
[840.50 --> 841.82]  And began to rebuke him
[841.82 --> 843.70]  But when Jesus turned
[843.70 --> 844.98]  And looked at his disciples
[844.98 --> 846.86]  He rebuked Peter
[846.86 --> 849.42]  Get behind me Satan
[849.42 --> 851.34]  You do not have in mind
[851.34 --> 852.38]  The concerns of God
[852.38 --> 854.16]  But merely human concerns
[854.16 --> 857.76]  Then he called the crowd to him
[857.76 --> 858.92]  Along with his disciples
[858.92 --> 859.76]  And said
[859.76 --> 862.34]  Whoever wants to be my disciple
[862.34 --> 863.52]  Must deny themselves
[863.52 --> 864.70]  And take up their cross
[864.70 --> 865.54]  And follow me
[865.54 --> 867.92]  For whoever wants to save their life
[867.92 --> 868.56]  Will lose it
[868.56 --> 870.82]  But whoever loses their life for me
[870.82 --> 871.72]  And for the gospel
[871.72 --> 872.66]  Will save it
[872.66 --> 874.72]  What good is it for someone
[874.72 --> 875.86]  To gain the whole world
[875.86 --> 877.10]  Yet forfeit their soul
[877.10 --> 879.90]  Or what can anyone give
[879.90 --> 881.14]  In exchange for their soul
[881.14 --> 883.50]  If anyone is ashamed of me
[883.50 --> 884.38]  And my words
[884.38 --> 885.34]  In this adulterous
[885.34 --> 886.46]  And sinful generation
[886.46 --> 888.00]  The Son of Man
[888.00 --> 889.44]  Will be ashamed of them
[889.44 --> 890.96]  When he comes
[890.96 --> 892.30]  In his Father's glory
[892.30 --> 893.54]  With the holy angels
[893.54 --> 916.86]  Alas, and did my Savior
[916.86 --> 923.16]  And did my sovereign die
[923.16 --> 930.66]  Would he devote that sacred bed
[930.66 --> 935.84]  For such a firm as I
[935.84 --> 942.64]  Was it for crimes that I had done
[942.64 --> 947.76]  He'd groaned upon the tree
[947.76 --> 952.10]  Amazing pity
[952.10 --> 954.36]  Grace unknown
[954.36 --> 959.02]  And a beyond degree
[959.02 --> 969.94]  Well, might the Son in darkness hide
[969.94 --> 974.98]  And shut his glories in
[974.98 --> 981.66]  When Christ the mighty Maker died
[981.66 --> 986.62]  For man the preacher's sin
[986.62 --> 993.36]  Once might I hide my blushing face
[993.36 --> 998.68]  While his dear cross appears
[998.68 --> 1005.28]  Dissolve my heart in thankfulness
[1005.28 --> 1010.92]  And melt my eyes with tears
[1010.92 --> 1017.62]  But drops of grief
[1017.62 --> 1019.66]  Can ne'er repay
[1019.66 --> 1025.66]  The debt of the by-o'er
[1025.66 --> 1031.98]  Here, Lord, I give myself away
[1031.98 --> 1037.30]  Tis all that I can do
[1037.30 --> 1042.54]  Alas, and did my Savior
[1042.54 --> 1043.66]  Bleed
[1043.66 --> 1048.82]  And did my sovereign die
[1048.82 --> 1052.70]  Amazing pity
[1052.70 --> 1055.08]  Grace unknown
[1055.08 --> 1059.78]  And love beyond degree
[1059.78 --> 1080.94]  Was it I, Lord, who fell asleep?
[1080.94 --> 1084.30]  When you brought me in as your friend
[1084.30 --> 1085.76]  And asked me to keep watch
[1085.76 --> 1086.36]  To pray
[1086.36 --> 1087.30]  To stay awake
[1087.30 --> 1088.82]  As the darkness beckoned me
[1088.82 --> 1090.10]  To sleep in my sin
[1090.10 --> 1094.00]  Was it I who denied you, my Lord?
[1094.74 --> 1096.30]  When they asked me about you
[1096.30 --> 1096.88]  And your way
[1096.88 --> 1098.32]  I shied away in fear
[1098.32 --> 1099.76]  Lied away through the truth
[1099.76 --> 1101.34]  To find a way without you
[1101.34 --> 1103.00]  For momentary acceptance
[1103.00 --> 1106.80]  Was it I who mocked you, my Lord?
[1107.40 --> 1109.08]  When I said I know your laws
[1109.08 --> 1111.00]  But self-righteously made my own
[1111.00 --> 1112.58]  Without knowing you
[1112.58 --> 1113.52]  Without loving you
[1113.52 --> 1115.58]  Without walking in the way of life
[1115.58 --> 1118.04]  Because my ways seemed to serve me better
[1118.04 --> 1121.84]  Was it I who afflicted you, my Lord?
[1122.76 --> 1123.88]  With my sin
[1123.88 --> 1125.04]  With whips of leather
[1125.04 --> 1125.84]  Spit of pride
[1125.84 --> 1126.92]  And a crown of thorns
[1126.92 --> 1127.82]  Driving the nails
[1127.82 --> 1128.74]  Through your flesh
[1128.74 --> 1130.08]  To the cross of Calvary
[1130.08 --> 1133.20]  Yes
[1133.20 --> 1136.98]  It is I who did this to you, my Lord
[1136.98 --> 1140.20]  I confess I tried to hide
[1140.20 --> 1141.76]  But it is I who has sinned
[1141.76 --> 1143.72]  I confess I tried to justify
[1143.72 --> 1145.56]  But it is I who broke your commands
[1145.56 --> 1148.48]  I confess I tried to self-sanctify
[1148.48 --> 1150.12]  But it is I who needs you
[1150.12 --> 1154.60]  How could you ever forgive me, my Lord?
[1156.38 --> 1158.98]  How could you ever come close to me, my Lord?
[1158.98 --> 1162.30]  How could you ever renew this brokenness, my Lord?
[1162.30 --> 1166.34]  Oh, the great mystery
[1166.34 --> 1168.86]  That you wrap me in your love
[1168.86 --> 1170.14]  And call me yours
[1170.14 --> 1173.04]  That you draw me into awareness
[1173.04 --> 1175.24]  Of your presence and delight in me
[1175.24 --> 1177.90]  That you give me new life
[1177.90 --> 1179.10]  In Christ Jesus
[1179.10 --> 1181.98]  And teach me in the way I should go
[1181.98 --> 1186.72]  Sanctifying my spirit, body, and soul
[1186.72 --> 1189.94]  As you are able
[1189.94 --> 1191.20]  Please rise
[1191.20 --> 1192.72]  And let's sing together
[1192.72 --> 1194.32]  Of our Lord's insurance
[1194.32 --> 1224.30]  Rock of Ages
[1224.30 --> 1225.30]  Let the Lord's insurance
[1225.30 --> 1227.30]  That's left for me
[1227.30 --> 1234.30]  Let me hide myself in thee
[1234.30 --> 1240.30]  Let the water and the blood
[1240.30 --> 1247.62]  From my wounded side which flows
[1247.62 --> 1253.30]  Be a Savior, double cure
[1253.30 --> 1256.30]  Save from wrath
[1256.30 --> 1260.30]  And make me pure
[1260.30 --> 1272.30]  Not the labors
[1272.30 --> 1275.30]  Of my hands
[1276.04 --> 1278.30]  Can fulfill
[1278.30 --> 1281.30]  Thy lost demands
[1281.30 --> 1284.30]  Could my zeal
[1284.30 --> 1285.30]  Could my zeal
[1285.30 --> 1286.30]  No respite
[1286.30 --> 1288.30]  No
[1288.30 --> 1290.30]  Could my tears
[1290.30 --> 1292.30]  Forever flow
[1292.30 --> 1296.30]  O Savior
[1296.30 --> 1298.30]  Not atone
[1298.30 --> 1303.30]  Thou must save it
[1303.30 --> 1304.30]  Be alone
[1306.30 --> 1310.30]  Feel
[1310.30 --> 1311.30]  Though the sacrifice
[1311.30 --> 1312.30]  And the most
[1312.30 --> 1313.30]  Won't charge
[1313.30 --> 1314.30]  Any day
[1314.30 --> 1315.30]  And I know
[1315.30 --> 1317.34]  May
[1317.34 --> 1327.30]  May you come to thee
[1327.30 --> 1328.30]  For prayer
[1328.30 --> 1335.34]  Help us look to Thee for grace
[1335.34 --> 1341.62]  Bow I to the fountain by
[1341.62 --> 1348.00]  Watch me, Savior, or I die
[1358.30 --> 1364.48]  Jesus, holy, pure and lovely
[1364.48 --> 1367.78]  King of mercy
[1367.78 --> 1376.64]  Jesus, holy, pure and lovely
[1376.64 --> 1379.88]  King of mercy
[1379.88 --> 1388.78]  You are Jesus, holy, pure and lovely
[1388.78 --> 1392.18]  King of mercy
[1392.18 --> 1403.32]  While my troubles bleating red
[1403.32 --> 1409.80]  When my eyes shall close in death
[1409.80 --> 1415.68]  When I soar to worlds unknown
[1415.68 --> 1422.92]  See beyond my judgment throne
[1422.92 --> 1429.46]  Rock of ages, glad for me
[1429.46 --> 1436.72]  Let me hide myself in Thee
[1436.72 --> 1442.60]  Kiss me, Savior, or I die
[1442.60 --> 1444.60]  Kiss me, Savior, or I die
[1444.60 --> 1450.84]  Oh, Jesus, holy, pure and lovely
[1450.84 --> 1452.60]  King of mercy
[1452.60 --> 1464.48]  Jesus, holy, pure and lovely
[1464.48 --> 1467.48]  King of mercy
[1467.48 --> 1473.36]  Hope of glory
[1473.36 --> 1476.36]  Jesus, holy, pure and lovely
[1476.36 --> 1479.36]  King of mercy
[1479.36 --> 1482.36]  Hope of glory
[1482.36 --> 1487.36]  Jesus, holy, pure and lovely
[1487.36 --> 1489.36]  King of mercy
[1489.36 --> 1495.24]  King of mercy
[1495.24 --> 1511.12]  King of mercy
[1511.12 --> 1513.86]  Hattelberg Catechism, question and answer 70
[1513.86 --> 1517.00]  I invite you to respond
[1517.00 --> 1523.00]  What does it mean to be washed with Christ's blood and spirit?
[1523.00 --> 1526.80]  To be washed with Christ's blood
[1526.80 --> 1530.88]  It means that God, by grace, has forgiven our sins
[1530.88 --> 1537.68]  Because of Christ's blood poured out for us in his sacrifice on the cross
[1537.68 --> 1545.68]  To be washed with Christ's spirit means that the Holy Spirit has renewed and sanctified us
[1545.68 --> 1547.68]  To be members of Christ's blood and sanctified us
[1547.68 --> 1552.68]  So that more and more we can become dead to sin and live holy and blameless lives
[1552.68 --> 1563.92]  Be
[1563.92 --> 1565.92]  Oh

[1567.92 --> 1569.92]  Oh
[1569.92 --> 1571.92]  Oh
[1571.92 --> 1573.92]  Oh

[1634.90 --> 1636.90]  Oh
[1636.90 --> 1638.28]  Oh
[1638.28 --> 1641.16]  in Egypt's cell,
[1641.16 --> 1646.22]  deeply, Lord, I pray.
[1650.22 --> 1656.16]  Make me, hold me,
[1656.66 --> 1661.58]  use me, fill me,
[1662.10 --> 1667.62]  I give my life to the waters
[1667.62 --> 1671.30]  and
[1671.30 --> 1679.24]  call me, guide me,
[1679.86 --> 1684.84]  lead me, walk beside me,
[1685.26 --> 1689.66]  I give my life to the
[1689.66 --> 1692.62]  Father's hand.
[1697.62 --> 1702.30]  Wonderful Lord, wonderful Savior,
[1703.30 --> 1705.12]  I know for sure,
[1706.12 --> 1711.30]  all of my days are held in your hands,
[1711.30 --> 1719.30]  crafted into your perfect land.
[1719.30 --> 1724.98]  You gently call me into your presence,
[1724.98 --> 1727.98]  guiding me by.
[1727.98 --> 1730.98]  Your Holy Spirit,
[1730.98 --> 1732.98]  teach me, dear Lord,
[1732.98 --> 1740.98]  to live all my life through your eyes.
[1740.98 --> 1745.66]  I'm captured by,
[1745.66 --> 1748.66]  your holy calling,
[1748.66 --> 1751.66]  set me apart,
[1751.66 --> 1757.66]  I know you're drawing me to yourself,
[1757.66 --> 1763.16]  lead me, Lord, I pray.
[1763.16 --> 1771.84]  You may be, hold me,
[1771.84 --> 1777.84]  use me, fill me,
[1777.84 --> 1784.84]  I give my life to the Father's hand.
[1784.84 --> 1787.52]  Lord, I pray.
[1787.52 --> 1788.52]  I pray.
[1788.52 --> 1789.52]  I pray.
[1789.52 --> 1790.52]  I pray.
[1790.52 --> 1793.20]  Lord, I pray.
[1793.20 --> 1794.20]  I pray.
[1794.20 --> 1795.20]  I pray.
[1795.20 --> 1797.20]  You may be,
[1797.20 --> 1800.20]  walk beside me,
[1800.20 --> 1809.20]  I give my life to the Father's hand.
[1809.20 --> 1810.20]  I pray.
[1810.20 --> 1811.20]  I pray.
[1811.20 --> 1812.20]  I pray.
[1812.20 --> 1813.20]  I pray.
[1813.20 --> 1814.20]  I pray.
[1814.20 --> 1816.20]  Beautiful Lord,
[1816.20 --> 1819.20]  wonderful Savior,
[1819.20 --> 1822.20]  I know for sure,
[1822.20 --> 1828.20]  all of my days are held in your hand,
[1828.20 --> 1837.20]  crafted into your perfect land.
[1837.20 --> 1839.20]  I pray.
[1839.20 --> 1840.20]  I pray.
[1840.20 --> 1841.20]  I pray.
[1841.20 --> 1842.20]  I pray.
[1842.20 --> 1843.20]  I pray.
[1843.20 --> 1844.20]  I pray.
[1844.20 --> 1845.20]  I pray.
[1845.20 --> 1846.20]  I pray.
[1846.20 --> 1847.20]  I pray.
[1847.20 --> 1848.20]  I pray.
[1848.20 --> 1849.20]  I pray.
[1849.20 --> 1850.20]  I pray.
[1850.20 --> 1851.20]  I pray.
[1851.20 --> 1852.20]  I pray.
[1852.20 --> 1853.20]  I pray.
[1853.20 --> 1854.20]  I pray.
[1854.20 --> 1855.20]  I pray.
[1855.20 --> 1856.20]  I pray.
[1856.20 --> 1857.20]  Good morning.
[1857.20 --> 1858.20]  My name is Brenda,
[1858.20 --> 1860.06]  and I'm one of the deacons here at Emmanuel.
[1860.06 --> 1863.20]  We continue our worship with the giving of our gifts,
[1863.20 --> 1866.20]  and our first offering is for the budget,
[1866.20 --> 1869.20]  the ministries, and mission of this church.
[1869.20 --> 1875.20]  And our special offering today is for adult and teen challenge.
[1875.20 --> 1877.20]  And I'm going to invite Wendy up,
[1877.20 --> 1882.20]  and she is going to share with us about their ministry.
[1882.20 --> 1885.20]  Welcome, Wendy.
[1885.20 --> 1887.20]  Thank you.
[1887.20 --> 1888.20]  Thank you.
[1888.20 --> 1890.20]  Yes, my name is Wendy Townsend.
[1890.20 --> 1896.20]  I'm the center director of the Women's Center here in Surrey,
[1896.20 --> 1898.20]  of Adult and Teen Challenge.
[1898.20 --> 1901.20]  And we have the Men's Center here from Chilliwack as well.
[1901.20 --> 1906.20]  We also have a center up in the Okanagan.
[1906.20 --> 1910.20]  And one thing I wanted to say is that, because we go to a lot of different churches,
[1910.20 --> 1918.20]  is that I love coming to a church where it's so evident that there's community and family.
[1918.20 --> 1920.20]  And that's the sense I get with you guys.
[1920.20 --> 1923.20]  Like, it seems like you enjoy life together.
[1923.20 --> 1927.20]  And so that's just a little snippet of what I saw this morning.
[1927.20 --> 1930.20]  So I'm so grateful that we're here.
[1930.20 --> 1936.20]  Just a quick, how many have heard of Adult and Teen Challenge?
[1936.20 --> 1937.20]  Yes.
[1937.20 --> 1943.20]  So if you haven't, we have tables in the foyer of information,
[1943.20 --> 1946.20]  get to know a little bit more about us.
[1946.20 --> 1947.20]  Excuse me.
[1947.20 --> 1953.20]  We're having a few of our students will be coming up.
[1953.20 --> 1960.20]  And we call them students because we feel that it's discipleship that changes lives.
[1960.20 --> 1962.20]  It's Jesus that changes lives.
[1962.20 --> 1970.20]  Not just, you know, cleaning up and being sober and staying away and being abstinent from stuff.
[1970.20 --> 1975.20]  It's actually changing something and being transformed from the heart.
[1975.20 --> 1983.20]  And so, you know, we, yeah, treatment is important, but transformation is the key.
[1983.20 --> 1984.20]  And that's what we go for.
[1984.20 --> 1987.20]  And so it's a year-long program.
[1987.20 --> 1990.20]  It's Bible-based.
[1990.20 --> 1998.20]  So every, all the curriculum, Teen Challenge is worldwide, but all of the curriculum is the same.
[1998.20 --> 2001.20]  It comes from the Word of God.
[2001.20 --> 2004.20]  And so if you go to, just go to the next slide.
[2004.20 --> 2009.20]  So we, it's 12 months, minimum of 12 months.
[2009.20 --> 2014.20]  We also have an aftercare program where once they graduate,
[2014.20 --> 2022.20]  they can come into either a leadership training program or you can just stay,
[2022.20 --> 2031.20]  come under the covering, get a job, you know, volunteer at the center for that transition part.
[2031.20 --> 2032.20]  Because it's really difficult.
[2032.20 --> 2034.20]  Everything changes.
[2034.20 --> 2037.20]  When somebody comes into the program, everything changes.
[2037.20 --> 2039.20]  Their friends change.
[2039.20 --> 2044.20]  A lot of times their family aren't healthy, so they need to have boundaries with them.
[2044.20 --> 2046.20]  And it's a new life.
[2046.20 --> 2054.20]  And so we try to get, as they're going through the program, getting into a church, getting into community,
[2054.20 --> 2059.20]  building a new life because it's different.
[2059.20 --> 2061.20]  You can't go back to the old.
[2061.20 --> 2065.20]  You can't go back to things that are going to drag you down.
[2065.20 --> 2070.20]  And so we provide that environment with, in our residential.
[2070.20 --> 2074.20]  We also have work experience programs, social enterprise.
[2074.20 --> 2078.20]  The men's center, they have, it's called Good Taco.
[2078.20 --> 2081.20]  And so we bought a franchise out in Chilliwack.
[2081.20 --> 2084.20]  And the men do their work experience there.
[2084.20 --> 2091.20]  Our women, we go to, we got a franchise, a noodle box out in Surrey.
[2091.20 --> 2095.20]  And so if you want any more information on those, come and visit us.
[2095.20 --> 2100.20]  The men and women who are going through the program work there.
[2100.20 --> 2107.20]  And it's providing a really safe environment for people to go and get experience.
[2107.20 --> 2112.20]  And it also does generate some income for our, for our centers.
[2112.20 --> 2116.20]  And then community care offices.
[2116.20 --> 2123.20]  We don't have any local ones, but we do have, it just provides information.
[2123.20 --> 2128.20]  And getting involved with other organizations that deal with addictions.
[2128.20 --> 2134.20]  And bringing people in, because not everybody can do a year long.
[2134.20 --> 2138.20]  It's really difficult sometimes with, if they have children,
[2138.20 --> 2142.20]  they're not able to have somebody care for their children while they're going through treatment.
[2142.20 --> 2147.20]  So we want to provide avenues for people to come and get some help.
[2147.20 --> 2152.20]  And learn that they don't have to live the way that they've been living.
[2152.20 --> 2154.20]  There is freedom in it.
[2154.20 --> 2159.20]  There's freedom from, from any type of addiction.
[2159.20 --> 2160.20]  There's freedom.
[2160.20 --> 2165.20]  And so we have seen, I get the privilege, I've been doing this for 12 years.
[2165.20 --> 2172.20]  I get the privilege of watching men and women grow, get set free, start giving back into the community,
[2172.20 --> 2174.20]  start serving in the ministry.
[2174.20 --> 2180.20]  And it's, it's been a challenge sometimes, hence the name.
[2180.20 --> 2188.20]  However, there's also been such rewarding experiences of seeing these men and women restore their families,
[2188.20 --> 2196.20]  get their kids back, get back into relationship, restore with, with parents and siblings.
[2196.20 --> 2198.20]  And it's pretty amazing.
[2198.20 --> 2203.20]  So we're going to have, um, for two, two of the women and two of the guys come up.
[2203.20 --> 2206.20]  And you guys can probably stand up in here.
[2206.20 --> 2207.20]  Come on.
[2207.20 --> 2208.20]  Come on.
[2208.20 --> 2209.20]  Come on.
[2209.20 --> 2212.20]  And, uh, they're going to give just a snippet of their story.
[2212.20 --> 2217.20]  Um, and so we call it, yeah, go in front here.
[2217.20 --> 2220.20]  And we call it Reality Is.
[2220.20 --> 2223.20]  And so, um, they're going to present that to you now.
[2223.20 --> 2234.20]  What is reality?
[2234.20 --> 2242.20]  Reality is, growing up, witnessing your mom's struggle with addiction, causing a very unstable and unpredictable environment,
[2242.20 --> 2248.20]  eventually losing her to a drug overdose, blaming yourself, leaving you traumatized, full of fear and full of pain.
[2248.20 --> 2254.20]  Reality is, searching for an identity and finding an escape from, and an escape from reality,
[2254.20 --> 2257.20]  finding one in drug men's, men and gang activity.
[2257.20 --> 2262.20]  Reality is, making your addiction a priority over your own family,
[2262.20 --> 2269.20]  and having your brother find you unconscious and overdosed, completely shattering an already fragile relationship.
[2269.20 --> 2277.20]  Reality is, being so weighed down from the chains of addiction, feeling so hopeless to ever find a way out, causing you to give up completely.
[2277.20 --> 2281.20]  How do I know that was reality? Because that was me.
[2281.20 --> 2291.20]  Reality is, smoking and isolating in your room most of your life because you don't feel loved and accepted by the world.
[2291.20 --> 2297.20]  Reality is, being so addicted to drugs that you steal money and sell things from your family and friends.
[2297.20 --> 2305.20]  Reality is, having no hope in changing, and feeling powerless over my addiction, believing there's no point in living.
[2305.20 --> 2308.20]  How do I know that was reality? Because that was me.
[2308.20 --> 2315.20]  Reality is, when the enemy tries to take your life when you were born.
[2315.20 --> 2319.20]  Reality is, when you've grown up feeling like you don't matter to anyone.
[2319.20 --> 2323.20]  Reality is, when your mom passed away leaving you and your family in chaos.
[2323.20 --> 2330.20]  Reality is, when your innocence was taken from you when you were 16, through intoxication of alcohol, which caused you to blame yourself.
[2330.20 --> 2335.20]  How do I know that's reality? Because that was me.
[2335.20 --> 2340.20]  Reality is, dropping out of high school to pursue a career in crime.
[2340.20 --> 2350.20]  Reality is, giving your dad chest compressions until the ambulance arrives, going to the hospital to find out he passed away.
[2350.20 --> 2359.20]  Reality is, continuously going back to the people that harmed you, robbed you, mentally scarred you, because you found comfort in their chaos.
[2359.20 --> 2364.20]  How do I know that was reality? Because that was me.
[2364.20 --> 2372.20]  Although we all have different realities, we were all saved by the same truth.
[2372.20 --> 2377.20]  The truth is, the Lord is healing my heart and redeeming what the locusts have eaten.
[2377.20 --> 2386.20]  Ten years to the exact date of losing my mom, I walked into the doors of Adult and Teen Challenge, marking the first day of the rest of my life.
[2386.20 --> 2394.20]  The truth is, I wouldn't change my reality now. He has given me a new name, and like the prodigal, he called me back to him.
[2394.20 --> 2399.20]  I am discovering just exactly who I am in Christ, and my identity is secured.
[2399.20 --> 2404.20]  The truth is, the Lord restored not just me, but my family as well.
[2404.20 --> 2409.20]  He answered the faithful, persistent prayers of my grandparents pleading with him to save me,
[2409.20 --> 2413.20]  and my relationships are being restored to even stronger than before.
[2413.20 --> 2424.20]  The truth is, he broke the chains that once weighed me down. He redeemed me, forgave me, and by his blood I am free.
[2424.20 --> 2428.20]  The truth is, God loves me more than anyone in this world.
[2428.20 --> 2434.20]  And he proved it by sending Jesus to die on the cross, which crucified my false belief that I am not accepted.
[2434.20 --> 2444.20]  The truth is, Jesus has made so many amazing promises to me, including that he will give me rest and freedom from my burdens, if I pick up my cross and follow him.
[2444.20 --> 2448.20]  The truth is, as it says in Colossians 1.13,
[2448.20 --> 2455.20]  for he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves.
[2455.20 --> 2462.20]  The truth is, I am here for a specific purpose, to fulfill God's assignment. I am a child of God.
[2462.20 --> 2466.20]  The truth is, I am important, I am loved, and I am worthy.
[2466.20 --> 2475.20]  The truth is, my mom is with God and isn't suffering anymore, and my family and I are safe in God's arms, where there is no chaos, only peace.
[2475.20 --> 2479.20]  The truth is, I am still pure in the eyes of my heavenly Father.
[2479.20 --> 2481.20]  Psalm 25, verse 5.
[2481.20 --> 2487.20]  Lead me by your truth and teach me, for you are the God who saves me. All day long I put my hope in you.
[2487.20 --> 2495.20]  The truth is, I am not a slave to my sin anymore, I am a child of God.
[2495.20 --> 2499.20]  1 Peter 1, verses 14-15 says,
[2499.20 --> 2508.20]  As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance, but as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct.
[2508.20 --> 2513.20]  Truth is, in the midst of a storm, he was using it to shape and develop my character.
[2513.20 --> 2515.20]  Romans chapter 5, verses 3-4 says,
[2515.20 --> 2524.20]  Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope.
[2524.20 --> 2532.20]  Truth is, there is no need for me to go back to the people who hurt me, robbed me, mentally scarred me, because I found someone who loves me.
[2532.20 --> 2535.20]  Ephesians chapter 1, verses 4-5 says,
[2535.20 --> 2541.20]  Even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him.
[2541.20 --> 2549.20]  In love, he predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will.
[2549.20 --> 2551.20]  And Jesus said,
[2551.20 --> 2555.20]  You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.
[2555.20 --> 2556.20]  Amen.
[2556.20 --> 2569.20]  Thank you so much, you guys.
[2569.20 --> 2577.20]  You know, there's so many ways that you can partner with us.
[2577.20 --> 2580.20]  As far as praying for us, pray for these men and women.
[2580.20 --> 2584.20]  We've had a challenging time with intake for the Women's Center.
[2584.20 --> 2589.20]  There's a number of reasons why it's getting more and more difficult.
[2589.20 --> 2592.20]  And so you can pray for us, please.
[2592.20 --> 2599.20]  Just in that, there's so many out there, you would think that we would be busting full, but we're not.
[2599.20 --> 2609.20]  And there's so many barriers for men and women right now that are making it very difficult for them to find freedom.
[2609.20 --> 2614.20]  And there's so many things that the government are doing that are keeping people stuck.
[2614.20 --> 2616.20]  And it breaks my heart, actually.
[2616.20 --> 2624.20]  But you can pray, because we know that the power of prayer is so important for our ministry.
[2624.20 --> 2629.20]  Just quickly, a couple more things.
[2629.20 --> 2632.20]  We're doing a dessert night.
[2632.20 --> 2634.20]  It's next Saturday.
[2634.20 --> 2635.20]  It's still time.
[2635.20 --> 2638.20]  You still have time to get tickets if you want.
[2638.20 --> 2640.20]  So talk to us out in the foyer.
[2640.20 --> 2647.20]  And so you'll be able to hear more testimonies and excuse me.
[2647.20 --> 2651.20]  Yeah, just get to learn more about our ministry.
[2651.20 --> 2655.20]  And then the final slide is, oh, yeah, that's just how to give.
[2655.20 --> 2658.20]  So we appreciate your guys' support.
[2658.20 --> 2668.20]  If any of the students and myself will be willing to ask any questions or answer any questions that you have.
[2668.20 --> 2674.20]  If you know somebody who's struggling, because I think we all know somebody who might be struggling,
[2674.20 --> 2678.20]  please come and take some information and some cards.
[2678.20 --> 2680.20]  And so thank you again.
[2685.20 --> 2698.20]  Thank you so much, Wendy and students, for being here and for sharing the realities and the truth.
[2698.20 --> 2701.20]  We thank you and we will pray for you.
[2715.20 --> 2716.20]  Thank you.
[2745.20 --> 2747.20]  Oh, God.
[2747.20 --> 2748.20]  All right.
[2748.20 --> 2749.20]  All right.
[2749.20 --> 2750.20]  And to God.
[2750.20 --> 2751.20]  Also peace and peace and peace.
[2751.20 --> 2752.20]  It's the church and peace.
[2752.20 --> 2753.20]  People are getting people to live in thejoys and deuce available here.
[2753.20 --> 2754.20]  All right.
[2754.20 --> 2755.20]  And you have to give yourself a question.
[2755.20 --> 2756.20]  Great.
[2756.20 --> 2757.20]  All right.
[2757.20 --> 2758.20]  And you have to give them such a battle.
[2758.20 --> 2759.20]  And you have to give this joy.
[2759.20 --> 2760.20]  And coś can be really good.
[2760.20 --> 2762.20]  And so that's just the Gom King.
[2762.20 --> 2763.44]  And it's the one man for child, too.
[2763.44 --> 2765.44]  And there are still a battle named the heaven.
[2765.44 --> 2766.44]  You have to give football.
[2766.44 --> 2768.44]  And we have to have to give your aside.
[2768.44 --> 2769.46]  Good path.
[2769.46 --> 2770.44]  And with some of the great.
[2770.44 --> 2771.26]  And we have to give our freedom
[2771.26 --> 2772.76]  As SHE can learn.
[2772.76 --> 2775.12]  And as well, Paul think live andseits have to believe in the world.
[2775.20 --> 2777.20]  Amen.
[2805.20 --> 2807.20]  Amen.
[2835.20 --> 2837.20]  Amen.
[2865.20 --> 2867.20]  Come on up, come on up, come on up.
[2867.20 --> 2870.20]  Oh, don't touch, don't touch.
[2870.20 --> 2871.20]  All right.
[2871.20 --> 2873.20]  How are we all doing?
[2873.20 --> 2874.20]  Good.
[2874.20 --> 2876.20]  I think Hank is sleeping.
[2876.20 --> 2878.20]  He's so tired all the time.
[2878.20 --> 2883.20]  Do you think you can wake him up?
[2883.20 --> 2885.20]  Can you on the count of three say,
[2885.20 --> 2887.20]  good morning, Hank, really loud?
[2887.20 --> 2889.20]  Yeah, okay, one, two, three.
[2889.20 --> 2891.20]  Good morning, Hank!
[2891.20 --> 2892.20]  Ah!
[2892.20 --> 2894.20]  Hi, kids!
[2894.20 --> 2896.20]  How are you?
[2896.20 --> 2898.20]  It's so good to see you again.
[2898.20 --> 2900.20]  Hey, Hank, how are you doing?
[2900.20 --> 2901.20]  Good.
[2901.20 --> 2902.20]  What were you up to this week?
[2902.20 --> 2905.20]  I went to the dog park again.
[2905.20 --> 2906.20]  You did?
[2906.20 --> 2908.20]  Yeah, I love the dog park.
[2908.20 --> 2910.20]  And do you have any stories again?
[2910.20 --> 2911.20]  Mm-hmm.
[2911.20 --> 2913.20]  They're not very good stories.
[2913.20 --> 2915.20]  I kind of made a few mistakes.
[2915.20 --> 2916.20]  You did, Hank.
[2916.20 --> 2917.20]  Oh, no.
[2917.20 --> 2918.20]  Do you want to tell us about it?
[2918.20 --> 2919.20]  Yeah.
[2919.20 --> 2929.20]  I was at the dog park, and my friend, Bikonce the Goose, she came up to me and said,
[2929.20 --> 2931.20]  Do I look good, Hank?
[2931.20 --> 2932.20]  And what did you say?
[2932.20 --> 2936.20]  I said, Well, your beak is really beaky.
[2936.20 --> 2937.20]  Oh, Hank.
[2937.20 --> 2938.20]  Beaky?
[2938.20 --> 2939.20]  Yeah.
[2939.20 --> 2942.20]  She didn't like that, and she put her head down and walked away.
[2942.20 --> 2944.20]  Oh, no, Hank, that's not good.
[2944.20 --> 2946.20]  Yeah, it gets worse.
[2946.20 --> 2947.20]  Oh, no.
[2947.20 --> 2948.20]  Yeah.
[2948.20 --> 2949.20]  Yeah.
[2949.20 --> 2950.20]  Yeah.
[2950.20 --> 2957.20]  Officer Scamperpants the Squirrel came by and said, Do I look like someone with authority?
[2957.20 --> 2959.20]  He's on the park patrol.
[2959.20 --> 2960.20]  Oh, boy.
[2960.20 --> 2961.20]  And what did you say?
[2961.20 --> 2965.20]  I said, Well, your tail is kind of bushy.
[2965.20 --> 2967.20]  Well, that probably didn't help, did it?
[2967.20 --> 2969.20]  No, he didn't really like that.
[2969.20 --> 2971.20]  He gave me a citation and walked away.
[2971.20 --> 2972.20]  Oh, no.
[2972.20 --> 2974.20]  Yeah, it gets worse.
[2974.20 --> 2975.20]  Oh, no.
[2975.20 --> 2976.20]  What happened next?
[2976.20 --> 2981.20]  Well, I went to the back corner and I started sniffing around a bench, and that's when Invisible
[2981.20 --> 2983.20]  Dave popped up.
[2983.20 --> 2985.20]  Who's Invisible Dave?
[2985.20 --> 2987.20]  He's my chameleon friend.
[2987.20 --> 2990.20]  Oh, and what happened with Invisible Dave?
[2990.20 --> 2992.20]  Well, he asked if I noticed him.
[2992.20 --> 2993.20]  And?
[2993.20 --> 2994.20]  What did you say?
[2994.20 --> 2996.20]  Well, honestly, I didn't.
[2996.20 --> 2998.20]  He blended right into the bench.
[2998.20 --> 2999.20]  Hmm.
[2999.20 --> 3001.20]  He probably didn't like that so much, did he?
[3001.20 --> 3002.20]  No.
[3002.20 --> 3003.20]  He was a little bit sad, too.
[3003.20 --> 3005.20]  And then I remembered something.
[3005.20 --> 3006.20]  What's that?
[3006.20 --> 3009.20]  People like to be encouraged.
[3009.20 --> 3010.20]  That's right.
[3010.20 --> 3013.20]  They like it when you say nice things about them and show them that you love them.
[3013.20 --> 3014.20]  Yeah.
[3014.20 --> 3016.20]  So I went up to Bicconce.
[3016.20 --> 3017.20]  There's a theme with those names.
[3017.20 --> 3018.20]  I didn't name them.
[3018.20 --> 3019.20]  That's fair.
[3019.20 --> 3024.20]  I went up to Bicconce and said, you have beautiful feathers, too.
[3024.20 --> 3026.20]  And you are glamorous.
[3026.20 --> 3027.20]  And did she like that?
[3027.20 --> 3028.20]  She did.
[3028.20 --> 3033.20]  And then I went up to Officer Scamperpants and I said, you do have authority because you
[3033.20 --> 3036.20]  are everywhere all the time.
[3036.20 --> 3038.20]  And he loved that, I bet.
[3038.20 --> 3039.20]  He did.
[3039.20 --> 3044.20]  And then it took me a while, but I found Invisible Dave on the tree.
[3044.20 --> 3050.20]  And I said, Invisible Dave, you are a masterpiece because God can make you any color you want
[3050.20 --> 3051.20]  to be.
[3051.20 --> 3052.20]  Oh, that's nice, Hank.
[3052.20 --> 3053.20]  He liked that.
[3053.20 --> 3054.20]  That's right.
[3054.20 --> 3055.20]  And you know what?
[3055.20 --> 3058.20]  You did learn a good lesson because it's important for us to encourage people, to lift
[3058.20 --> 3059.20]  them up, right?
[3059.20 --> 3060.20]  Yeah.
[3060.20 --> 3062.20]  People like to be lifted up and encouraged.
[3062.20 --> 3065.20]  Well, you know what we're going to talk today or about today in children's worship time?
[3065.20 --> 3066.20]  What's that?
[3066.20 --> 3069.20]  Well, we also just heard some stories from Teen Challenge.
[3069.20 --> 3070.20]  I don't know.
[3070.20 --> 3071.20]  You were sleeping, maybe.
[3071.20 --> 3072.20]  Did you hear them?
[3072.20 --> 3073.20]  I did.
[3073.20 --> 3077.20]  Well, they told stories about how they were lifted up by God and how we're all lifted
[3077.20 --> 3078.20]  up by God.
[3078.20 --> 3085.20]  And because of that, Jesus needs to be worshiped and exalted and lifted up even more, right?
[3085.20 --> 3086.20]  Yeah.
[3086.20 --> 3088.20]  So we're going to talk about that in children's worship time today.
[3088.20 --> 3089.20]  Does that make sense?
[3089.20 --> 3090.20]  Yeah?
[3090.20 --> 3091.20]  Sound good?
[3091.20 --> 3092.20]  Okay.
[3092.20 --> 3094.20]  We're going to pray and then we're going to do the kids blessing and then we're going
[3094.20 --> 3095.20]  to go off to children's worship time.
[3095.20 --> 3096.20]  Yeah!
[3096.20 --> 3097.20]  All right.
[3097.20 --> 3098.20]  Let's pray.
[3098.20 --> 3099.20]  Bow our heads.
[3099.20 --> 3100.20]  Close our eyes.
[3100.20 --> 3101.20]  God, thank you so much for today.
[3101.20 --> 3104.20]  Thank you that we could be here in church, that we could hear stories about how you're
[3104.20 --> 3107.20]  so active in our lives and that we could learn more about you.
[3107.20 --> 3108.20]  We pray that you'll be with us now.
[3108.20 --> 3112.20]  The kids as we go to children's worship time and the grown ups as we stay back here.
[3112.20 --> 3116.20]  Lord, we just pray that you will teach us more about what it means to follow you.
[3116.20 --> 3117.20]  We pray this in your name.
[3117.20 --> 3118.20]  Amen.
[3118.20 --> 3119.20]  Amen.
[3119.20 --> 3120.20]  Okay, kids, let's stand up.
[3120.20 --> 3121.20]  Church, you as well, please.
[3121.20 --> 3123.20]  Everybody on your feet.
[3123.20 --> 3127.20]  The kids on the count of three, they're going to say, the Lord be with you and then you can
[3127.20 --> 3128.20]  respond in kind.
[3128.20 --> 3129.20]  All right?
[3129.20 --> 3130.20]  So kids, are you ready?
[3130.20 --> 3131.20]  One, two, three.
[3131.20 --> 3133.20]  The Lord be with you.
[3133.20 --> 3135.20]  And also with you.
[3135.20 --> 3163.20]  With you.
[3163.20 --> 3167.12]  My name is John and I'm one of the elders of the church here.
[3167.62 --> 3171.24]  I'd like to lead us in our congregational prayer this morning.
[3174.46 --> 3177.38]  The words of the psalmist ring true for us today, Lord.
[3178.42 --> 3179.88]  The words of Psalm 100.
[3180.16 --> 3182.88]  Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth.
[3183.62 --> 3185.12]  Worship the Lord with gladness.
[3186.02 --> 3187.82]  Come before him with joyful songs.
[3188.96 --> 3190.34]  Know that the Lord is God.
[3190.34 --> 3191.98]  It is he who made us.
[3191.98 --> 3193.24]  We are his.
[3193.72 --> 3196.16]  We are his people, the sheep of his pasture.
[3197.62 --> 3200.64]  Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise.
[3201.64 --> 3204.42]  Give thanks to him and praise his name.
[3205.42 --> 3208.02]  For the Lord is good and his love endures forever.
[3208.98 --> 3211.32]  His faithfulness through all generations.
[3213.34 --> 3216.24]  Lord, you are this God that we read about in the Psalms.
[3216.84 --> 3218.98]  And we are here today to worship you.
[3218.98 --> 3222.90]  We are here to give you the honor and glory that is due your name.
[3224.32 --> 3226.52]  Lord, we as sinful people come before you.
[3228.40 --> 3230.88]  Lord, sometimes we don't realize we are broken.
[3232.08 --> 3233.68]  Sometimes we don't want to acknowledge that.
[3233.76 --> 3235.90]  But we come, Lord, as sinners before your throne.
[3235.90 --> 3247.58]  We acknowledge that your son has done for us such a great act that we are here, Lord, to give you the honor and glory that is due your name.
[3249.20 --> 3253.70]  Lord, we're thankful for the opportunity to be able to worship in your house this morning.
[3254.42 --> 3256.28]  Lord, those who wanted to come.
[3256.70 --> 3258.64]  Lord, we pray for those that did not want to.
[3259.34 --> 3260.54]  Pray for those that could not.
[3260.54 --> 3265.54]  Lord, those who are dealing with illnesses and not able to be here.
[3266.24 --> 3270.20]  Lord, we ask a blessing for those in our church family who are recovering from surgery.
[3270.78 --> 3274.18]  Pray for Emily and Judy as they recover from hip surgery.
[3275.40 --> 3281.94]  Lord, we pray for those that are dealing with cancer like Tessa, Tanya, and Doug who are going through treatments.
[3282.82 --> 3283.96]  And looking forward to healing.
[3284.50 --> 3287.52]  Pray a blessing for each one as they go through that difficult journey.
[3287.52 --> 3293.64]  Lord, we pray for Lena as well that she's being able to return home again.
[3293.74 --> 3296.86]  We pray for blessing for her for continued recovery.
[3297.30 --> 3303.42]  And Lord, we pray for those that are suffering silently.
[3303.78 --> 3305.72]  Those who we don't always see every day.
[3306.34 --> 3307.90]  Those who are dealing with mental illnesses.
[3308.10 --> 3309.64]  Those who are dealing with addictions.
[3311.00 --> 3314.06]  Lord, may your spirit be with each one in their journeys.
[3314.06 --> 3325.54]  Lord, we're thankful for the opportunities that this church has to reach out and serve not only in our own church community but elsewhere.
[3327.00 --> 3335.24]  Lord, that our work that may be done to your honor and glory, that we may show your light to those around us.
[3335.24 --> 3347.50]  Lord, we had a mention this morning of Kevin becoming an ordained pastor in this following year.
[3348.92 --> 3352.74]  Lord, we pray a blessing on him as he finishes his last lessons.
[3353.08 --> 3356.98]  And Lord, we have this meeting this coming up Tuesday.
[3356.98 --> 3365.66]  Lord, we ask a blessing as we discuss and work together to build our community up with the work that Kevin is to do here.
[3368.14 --> 3374.68]  And Lord, we as a community are also looking for new office bearers to fill positions for the coming terms.
[3375.30 --> 3378.38]  We pray a blessing for those whose hearts are open to serve.
[3378.38 --> 3388.82]  Lord, we're thankful for the message that a few of these members of Teen Challenge were able to bless us with this morning.
[3390.40 --> 3394.42]  We see your spirit at work in this group and we pray a blessing on their work.
[3395.70 --> 3403.24]  That they may continue to be an effective witness for those that are having a difficult time in life.
[3403.24 --> 3410.92]  Lord, we pray for blessings of prayer and financial needs that need to be met.
[3414.50 --> 3418.28]  Lord, we pray a blessing on Pastor Chris.
[3418.40 --> 3420.38]  Lord, as he preaches your word to us this morning,
[3422.10 --> 3425.88]  that his words may be your words to us as a community.
[3426.62 --> 3432.30]  We may take that to heart and take it to our lives and workplaces in this coming week.
[3433.24 --> 3438.08]  Lord, Psalm 105 says,
[3438.92 --> 3441.66]  Look to you in your strength.
[3442.56 --> 3444.10]  Seek your face always.
[3445.16 --> 3446.88]  Lord, as we go in this coming week,
[3447.20 --> 3450.00]  may that be something that we are able to do,
[3450.68 --> 3452.68]  not through our own strength,
[3453.26 --> 3456.42]  but through the blessing of your spirit
[3456.42 --> 3459.56]  and the work that Jesus Christ has done for us on the cross.
[3460.30 --> 3462.66]  As we ask in your name alone, amen.
[3463.24 --> 3464.24]  Thank you.
[3478.66 --> 3481.42]  Before we open the scripture and continue on,
[3481.52 --> 3482.30]  may I just say,
[3482.70 --> 3484.94]  it is so good to be with you this morning.
[3485.10 --> 3487.00]  It is so good to hear from you,
[3487.14 --> 3489.16]  Wendy, and everyone who is up on stage.
[3489.84 --> 3490.76]  The Lord bless you.
[3491.20 --> 3494.34]  Thank you for blessing us with your testimony and your story.
[3494.44 --> 3495.88]  Thank you for giving us an example
[3495.88 --> 3501.16]  of how God's truth overcomes even the darkest realities.
[3501.72 --> 3502.42]  And that's amazing.
[3502.58 --> 3503.22]  Thank you for that.
[3503.42 --> 3504.20]  And in fact,
[3504.32 --> 3506.54]  that is so illustrative of the sermon
[3506.54 --> 3508.98]  that the Lord has laid on my heart for us this morning
[3508.98 --> 3511.48]  that only the Holy Spirit could be at work
[3511.48 --> 3512.80]  in the midst of what's going on here.
[3512.80 --> 3515.50]  We're going to continue in our series
[3515.50 --> 3517.90]  through the book of Thessalonians.
[3518.00 --> 3519.28]  We're in 1 Thessalonians.
[3519.60 --> 3521.92]  We're going to read together from chapter 5,
[3522.04 --> 3523.82]  verses 16 through 22.
[3524.06 --> 3524.96]  The first time through,
[3525.04 --> 3526.58]  it will be on the screen behind me.
[3526.92 --> 3527.44]  But of course,
[3527.50 --> 3528.94]  I invite you to open up your own Bible
[3528.94 --> 3531.28]  or if you have a device with the Bible app on it,
[3531.34 --> 3532.30]  go there.
[3532.48 --> 3534.56]  If you're looking for a Bible to get your hands on,
[3534.62 --> 3535.52]  there are some at the back.
[3535.72 --> 3536.60]  You can grab one of those.
[3537.46 --> 3538.16]  Open it up,
[3538.24 --> 3539.10]  read through with us,
[3539.14 --> 3540.08]  and then keep it open
[3540.08 --> 3541.04]  as, of course,
[3541.10 --> 3543.46]  we'll be digging deep into these words.
[3544.68 --> 3546.74]  Let me begin by reading together
[3546.74 --> 3549.26]  one time through 1 Thessalonians 5,
[3549.26 --> 3552.38]  starting at verse 16 through to 22.
[3554.44 --> 3555.98]  Rejoice always.
[3557.36 --> 3558.46]  Pray continually.
[3559.42 --> 3561.24]  Give thanks in all circumstances,
[3561.66 --> 3565.66]  for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.
[3566.60 --> 3568.98]  Do not quench the Spirit.
[3569.94 --> 3572.12]  Do not treat prophecies with contempt,
[3572.44 --> 3573.72]  but test them all.
[3574.18 --> 3575.88]  Hold on to what is good.
[3576.36 --> 3579.16]  Reject every kind of evil.
[3579.68 --> 3581.08]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3584.74 --> 3586.54]  We're going to jump right in
[3586.54 --> 3588.54]  to this morning together.
[3589.90 --> 3590.86]  And this morning,
[3591.02 --> 3592.66]  in this text here,
[3592.76 --> 3594.44]  what I hope and pray
[3594.44 --> 3597.06]  that the Spirit will help us to see
[3597.06 --> 3599.04]  is that we might see
[3599.04 --> 3600.36]  what it means
[3600.36 --> 3603.04]  to live a life in Christ
[3603.04 --> 3606.00]  drenched in the Holy Spirit.
[3606.72 --> 3608.04]  That's the big idea
[3608.04 --> 3609.20]  for us this morning.
[3609.36 --> 3611.38]  Life in Christ Jesus
[3611.38 --> 3612.42]  is lived,
[3612.76 --> 3614.94]  drenched in the Holy Spirit.
[3615.90 --> 3616.48]  Now,
[3617.20 --> 3618.42]  when I say that,
[3618.80 --> 3619.50]  immediately,
[3619.50 --> 3621.22]  some of you
[3621.22 --> 3622.98]  have all sorts of ideas
[3622.98 --> 3624.92]  about what that's supposed to look like
[3624.92 --> 3626.08]  and what that might mean.
[3627.54 --> 3628.46]  Some of you
[3628.46 --> 3630.34]  have no idea
[3630.34 --> 3632.20]  about what that's supposed to look like
[3632.20 --> 3633.50]  and what that might mean.
[3634.94 --> 3636.70]  Let's see if we can figure out together
[3636.70 --> 3638.14]  just what the Bible means
[3638.14 --> 3639.70]  when we hear that
[3639.70 --> 3642.02]  and when we see that kind of language.
[3643.46 --> 3643.62]  Now,
[3643.68 --> 3645.26]  in the text that we read here,
[3645.26 --> 3646.72]  there are sort of
[3646.72 --> 3649.20]  two obvious halves
[3649.20 --> 3650.86]  for us this morning.
[3651.68 --> 3652.84]  The first half
[3652.84 --> 3655.74]  are positive imperatives
[3655.74 --> 3657.68]  as an explanation
[3657.68 --> 3660.66]  of what God's will for you
[3660.66 --> 3662.78]  in Christ Jesus is.
[3663.58 --> 3663.84]  Right?
[3663.94 --> 3665.36]  To rejoice always,
[3665.70 --> 3666.86]  to pray continually,
[3667.24 --> 3668.40]  and to give thanks
[3668.40 --> 3669.48]  in every circumstance.
[3670.46 --> 3671.84]  And the second half
[3671.84 --> 3672.62]  of what we read
[3672.62 --> 3673.74]  sort of stacks
[3673.74 --> 3675.40]  negative imperatives.
[3675.56 --> 3676.34]  That's things
[3676.34 --> 3677.50]  people in Christ
[3677.50 --> 3678.64]  should not do.
[3679.28 --> 3679.44]  Right?
[3679.48 --> 3680.78]  Do not quench the Spirit.
[3681.14 --> 3682.34]  Do not treat prophecies
[3682.34 --> 3683.16]  with contempt
[3683.16 --> 3684.38]  and reject
[3684.38 --> 3685.80]  or don't entertain
[3685.80 --> 3686.96]  every kind,
[3687.08 --> 3687.72]  any kind
[3687.72 --> 3688.54]  of evil.
[3689.68 --> 3690.02]  Now,
[3690.08 --> 3690.94]  I think that both
[3690.94 --> 3692.44]  of these halves
[3692.44 --> 3693.62]  are part
[3693.62 --> 3695.50]  of the whole picture
[3695.50 --> 3696.76]  of what it means
[3696.76 --> 3697.66]  to live
[3697.66 --> 3698.48]  as one
[3698.48 --> 3699.76]  in Christ
[3699.76 --> 3700.34]  Jesus.
[3701.62 --> 3702.68]  And I want us
[3702.68 --> 3703.52]  to be really clear
[3703.52 --> 3705.06]  about this.
[3706.52 --> 3707.40]  The kind
[3707.40 --> 3708.14]  of life
[3708.14 --> 3709.58]  that the scriptures
[3709.58 --> 3710.54]  have outlined
[3710.54 --> 3711.50]  for us
[3711.50 --> 3712.68]  and call us
[3712.68 --> 3713.08]  to
[3713.08 --> 3714.74]  as believers,
[3715.34 --> 3716.34]  the person
[3716.34 --> 3718.08]  who is in Christ
[3718.08 --> 3719.30]  is commanded
[3719.30 --> 3720.60]  to live this way,
[3720.78 --> 3721.56]  and that part
[3721.56 --> 3722.70]  in Christ
[3722.70 --> 3723.98]  is critical
[3723.98 --> 3725.56]  for these commands.
[3726.46 --> 3726.60]  Right?
[3726.64 --> 3727.42]  The way of life
[3727.42 --> 3728.60]  that we are to be
[3728.60 --> 3729.08]  about
[3729.08 --> 3730.86]  is only possible
[3730.86 --> 3731.78]  for those
[3731.78 --> 3733.00]  who are in Christ
[3733.00 --> 3734.22]  because it is
[3734.22 --> 3735.54]  the life of Christ
[3735.54 --> 3736.56]  we are living.
[3738.48 --> 3739.12]  And so,
[3739.20 --> 3739.70]  that's where I want to
[3739.70 --> 3741.06]  dive in together.
[3741.20 --> 3742.04]  What does that mean?
[3742.34 --> 3742.52]  Right?
[3742.64 --> 3743.60]  For you
[3743.60 --> 3744.60]  in Christ
[3744.60 --> 3745.18]  Jesus.
[3746.74 --> 3747.18]  Now,
[3747.22 --> 3747.98]  for those who know me
[3747.98 --> 3748.72]  know that I
[3748.72 --> 3750.64]  am a bit of a grammar nerd,
[3750.74 --> 3751.36]  although not as big
[3751.36 --> 3751.88]  as Jackie
[3751.88 --> 3752.68]  over there.
[3752.68 --> 3754.98]  But,
[3755.10 --> 3756.14]  because of that,
[3756.24 --> 3757.10]  I want you to hear
[3757.10 --> 3758.16]  that the preposition
[3758.16 --> 3759.22]  matters.
[3760.48 --> 3760.94]  Right?
[3761.00 --> 3761.72]  The preposition,
[3761.96 --> 3762.44]  in this case,
[3762.58 --> 3763.70]  extends the pronoun.
[3764.32 --> 3764.42]  Now,
[3764.48 --> 3765.56]  so when you read that,
[3765.80 --> 3766.82]  you might read it
[3766.82 --> 3767.48]  and think,
[3767.92 --> 3769.52]  this is God's will
[3769.52 --> 3770.12]  for me
[3770.12 --> 3772.34]  because of Jesus.
[3772.60 --> 3772.88]  Meaning,
[3773.14 --> 3774.48]  God has shown me Jesus
[3774.48 --> 3775.68]  and I need to live
[3775.68 --> 3776.16]  like Him.
[3776.50 --> 3777.70]  Jesus is the example
[3777.70 --> 3778.86]  and I have to follow
[3778.86 --> 3780.18]  in order to be
[3780.18 --> 3781.18]  in God's will.
[3781.18 --> 3782.36]  And honestly,
[3782.52 --> 3783.06]  from a pure,
[3783.32 --> 3784.48]  sort of simple word
[3784.48 --> 3785.06]  perspective,
[3785.36 --> 3786.36]  that's not wrong.
[3786.62 --> 3787.56]  But so often,
[3787.66 --> 3788.60]  for so many of us,
[3788.68 --> 3790.28]  behind that perspective
[3790.28 --> 3791.66]  is an assumption.
[3792.42 --> 3793.54]  An assumption
[3793.54 --> 3794.46]  that namely,
[3795.02 --> 3796.90]  we are the primary actor.
[3797.62 --> 3799.30]  That we are the agent.
[3800.54 --> 3801.38]  That we think,
[3801.58 --> 3802.30]  I have to follow
[3802.30 --> 3803.18]  Jesus' example
[3803.18 --> 3804.70]  in order to get in
[3804.70 --> 3805.44]  God's will.
[3806.96 --> 3807.18]  Right?
[3807.58 --> 3808.18]  We think
[3808.80 --> 3810.58]  that it is something
[3810.58 --> 3811.96]  that we do.
[3812.80 --> 3813.78]  That it is primarily
[3813.78 --> 3815.78]  our action.
[3816.68 --> 3818.12]  But what the Bible means,
[3818.26 --> 3818.58]  however,
[3818.86 --> 3820.14]  is so much more than that.
[3820.20 --> 3820.38]  In fact,
[3820.42 --> 3821.62]  it's so much deeper than that.
[3822.00 --> 3823.36]  It goes beyond that.
[3824.00 --> 3824.44]  This is,
[3824.66 --> 3825.04]  first of all,
[3825.10 --> 3826.86]  about who you are.
[3828.26 --> 3828.68]  Right?
[3828.72 --> 3829.64]  And who you are
[3829.64 --> 3830.14]  isn't,
[3830.26 --> 3830.74]  first of all,
[3830.78 --> 3831.68]  about what you do.
[3832.28 --> 3833.88]  It's about who you belong to.
[3834.80 --> 3836.06]  Who you are part of.
[3836.10 --> 3837.32]  Who you are connected to.
[3837.32 --> 3839.14]  Who you are at one with.
[3840.54 --> 3840.86]  You,
[3841.24 --> 3842.64]  in Christ Jesus,
[3843.02 --> 3844.26]  is one sort of
[3844.26 --> 3846.40]  comprehensive identifier.
[3847.66 --> 3848.66]  In Christ,
[3848.86 --> 3849.94]  is about belonging.
[3851.10 --> 3851.22]  Right?
[3851.26 --> 3852.46]  You can't hard work
[3852.46 --> 3853.34]  your way in
[3853.34 --> 3854.88]  to relationship to Jesus.
[3855.96 --> 3857.04]  It's not enough
[3857.04 --> 3857.60]  for Jesus
[3857.60 --> 3858.94]  to be your example.
[3859.30 --> 3860.94]  You must be in Him.
[3861.02 --> 3862.08]  Become part of Him.
[3862.08 --> 3864.60]  I'm going to show you
[3864.60 --> 3866.38]  a couple other Bible texts
[3866.38 --> 3867.02]  really quickly
[3867.02 --> 3868.78]  that make this same point.
[3869.44 --> 3870.44]  I'll run through them quickly,
[3870.56 --> 3871.48]  but they will be on the screen
[3871.48 --> 3871.96]  behind me
[3871.96 --> 3873.14]  so you can note them.
[3874.54 --> 3875.26]  The Apostle Paul
[3875.26 --> 3876.54]  writes in Romans 6,
[3876.84 --> 3877.72]  In the same way,
[3877.88 --> 3878.80]  count yourselves
[3878.80 --> 3879.78]  dead to sin,
[3879.94 --> 3881.32]  but alive to God
[3881.32 --> 3883.84]  in Christ Jesus.
[3885.36 --> 3885.84]  Right?
[3885.92 --> 3887.16]  1 Corinthians 1, 3,
[3887.26 --> 3888.38]  It is because of God
[3888.38 --> 3889.62]  that you are in
[3889.62 --> 3891.48]  Christ Jesus.
[3892.70 --> 3894.00]  Galatians 3, 26,
[3894.10 --> 3895.02]  So in Christ
[3895.02 --> 3896.82]  you are all children of God
[3896.82 --> 3898.10]  through faith.
[3899.08 --> 3899.48]  And in fact,
[3899.56 --> 3900.80]  this is a major theme
[3900.80 --> 3901.78]  of the letter
[3901.78 --> 3902.70]  to the Ephesians.
[3902.94 --> 3903.36]  I encourage you
[3903.36 --> 3903.86]  this afternoon,
[3904.00 --> 3904.42]  read it.
[3905.02 --> 3905.72]  Ephesians 2,
[3906.20 --> 3907.30]  God raised us up
[3907.30 --> 3907.88]  with Christ
[3907.88 --> 3909.08]  and seated us with Him
[3909.08 --> 3910.34]  in the heavenly realms
[3910.34 --> 3912.28]  in Christ Jesus.
[3913.14 --> 3913.82]  But now,
[3913.98 --> 3914.80]  in Christ Jesus,
[3914.98 --> 3916.52]  you who were once far away
[3916.52 --> 3917.62]  have been brought near.
[3918.66 --> 3919.90]  Or to put it another way,
[3919.98 --> 3920.52]  as Paul does
[3920.52 --> 3921.64]  in Galatians 2, 20,
[3921.64 --> 3923.38]  I have been crucified
[3923.38 --> 3924.30]  with Christ
[3924.30 --> 3926.10]  and I no longer live,
[3926.22 --> 3927.72]  but Christ lives in me.
[3928.56 --> 3929.80]  The life I now live
[3929.80 --> 3930.46]  in the body,
[3930.56 --> 3931.54]  I live by faith
[3931.54 --> 3932.54]  in the Son of God
[3932.54 --> 3933.60]  who loved me
[3933.60 --> 3935.42]  and gave Himself up for me.
[3936.84 --> 3936.98]  Right?
[3937.06 --> 3938.04]  This life
[3938.04 --> 3939.52]  that we are called to live
[3939.52 --> 3941.18]  is the life of Jesus
[3941.18 --> 3942.80]  working in you
[3942.80 --> 3943.70]  and through you.
[3944.56 --> 3945.98]  And Jesus only works
[3945.98 --> 3947.32]  in you and through you
[3947.32 --> 3948.64]  when He lives in you.
[3948.64 --> 3950.10]  and when you live in Him.
[3950.88 --> 3952.14]  And He lives in you
[3952.14 --> 3952.94]  by grace
[3952.94 --> 3953.84]  through faith.
[3953.90 --> 3954.40]  What did we read?
[3954.46 --> 3955.32]  The life I live,
[3955.40 --> 3956.44]  I live by faith.
[3957.10 --> 3958.14]  So in Christ,
[3958.26 --> 3960.02]  you are all children of God
[3960.02 --> 3961.52]  through faith.
[3962.60 --> 3964.14]  Faith that the Son of God
[3964.14 --> 3964.98]  loved me
[3964.98 --> 3965.96]  and gave Himself
[3965.96 --> 3967.04]  up for me.
[3968.22 --> 3968.94]  And if you hear
[3968.94 --> 3969.84]  one thing this morning,
[3969.92 --> 3970.32]  maybe this,
[3970.52 --> 3971.52]  don't get it twisted,
[3971.90 --> 3972.10]  right?
[3972.34 --> 3974.00]  Faith precedes works
[3974.00 --> 3975.96]  because Christ in you
[3975.96 --> 3977.14]  is necessary
[3977.14 --> 3978.64]  for the kinds of works
[3978.64 --> 3980.04]  He calls us to.
[3980.94 --> 3981.94]  Apart from Christ
[3981.94 --> 3982.94]  and the Holy Spirit,
[3983.28 --> 3984.38]  apart from the operation
[3984.38 --> 3985.04]  of this faith,
[3985.20 --> 3986.56]  apart from being in Him,
[3986.82 --> 3987.96]  this kind of life
[3987.96 --> 3988.72]  is impossible.
[3990.66 --> 3991.74]  And this is the foundational
[3991.74 --> 3993.10]  philosophy of ministry
[3993.10 --> 3995.10]  for Adult and Teen Challenge.
[3996.86 --> 3997.04]  Right?
[3997.12 --> 3999.60]  This is the only way
[3999.60 --> 4000.90]  possible to live
[4000.90 --> 4001.60]  the kind of life
[4001.60 --> 4002.80]  that God is calling us
[4002.80 --> 4003.68]  to live.
[4004.72 --> 4005.74]  And if you try to do it
[4005.74 --> 4006.16]  without Him,
[4006.82 --> 4007.90]  you will burn out.
[4009.30 --> 4010.44]  You will fall short.
[4011.20 --> 4012.56]  You will prove inadequate
[4012.56 --> 4014.48]  over and over and over.
[4015.34 --> 4016.62]  And as I stand in front of you
[4016.62 --> 4017.12]  this morning,
[4017.90 --> 4018.30]  please,
[4019.30 --> 4021.82]  as I muster my pastoral heart,
[4022.02 --> 4023.94]  please hear this.
[4025.26 --> 4026.66]  Because some of you
[4026.66 --> 4028.38]  have been playing
[4028.38 --> 4029.30]  at Christianity
[4029.30 --> 4030.96]  without being converted
[4030.96 --> 4031.48]  to Christ.
[4032.80 --> 4035.34]  without being in Him.
[4036.88 --> 4037.48]  And so,
[4037.82 --> 4038.94]  you beat yourself up
[4038.94 --> 4040.80]  and you burden yourself
[4040.80 --> 4042.42]  with an impossible law
[4042.42 --> 4043.40]  because your heart
[4043.40 --> 4044.50]  is still stone.
[4048.00 --> 4048.66]  Some of you
[4048.66 --> 4049.24]  don't even know
[4049.24 --> 4050.32]  any different.
[4052.54 --> 4053.90]  And there's some of us
[4053.90 --> 4054.52]  here
[4054.52 --> 4056.38]  who expect people
[4056.38 --> 4057.46]  to be living
[4057.46 --> 4058.72]  your understanding
[4058.72 --> 4059.78]  of the Christian way
[4059.78 --> 4061.32]  before you allow
[4061.32 --> 4061.94]  that they even
[4061.94 --> 4062.78]  become Christian.
[4064.16 --> 4064.54]  Right?
[4064.58 --> 4065.22]  To put it another way,
[4065.30 --> 4065.72]  some of you
[4065.72 --> 4066.92]  require the fruit
[4066.92 --> 4067.72]  of faith
[4067.72 --> 4068.50]  but never look
[4068.50 --> 4069.44]  for the seed of faith.
[4070.84 --> 4071.96]  The seed of faith
[4071.96 --> 4072.56]  is all you need.
[4072.64 --> 4073.44]  That's where it starts.
[4073.78 --> 4074.44]  I believe
[4074.44 --> 4075.28]  Jesus is Lord
[4075.28 --> 4075.76]  and that God
[4075.76 --> 4076.18]  raised Him
[4076.18 --> 4076.72]  from the dead.
[4076.72 --> 4079.18]  If you say that
[4079.18 --> 4080.18]  and believe it,
[4080.38 --> 4081.82]  that is you
[4081.82 --> 4083.08]  in Christ.
[4083.08 --> 4087.18]  and still some of us
[4087.18 --> 4088.70]  here this morning
[4088.70 --> 4090.50]  think the way in
[4090.50 --> 4091.68]  is by grace
[4091.68 --> 4092.34]  through faith
[4092.34 --> 4093.24]  and you have that
[4093.24 --> 4094.44]  but somehow,
[4095.14 --> 4095.34]  right,
[4095.44 --> 4096.16]  over time
[4096.16 --> 4097.18]  you've come to believe
[4097.18 --> 4097.76]  that the way
[4097.76 --> 4098.92]  you persevere,
[4099.42 --> 4100.32]  the way you make it
[4100.32 --> 4100.88]  to the end
[4100.88 --> 4102.16]  is by your sheer
[4102.16 --> 4103.26]  determination and grit.
[4104.38 --> 4104.78]  So yeah,
[4104.86 --> 4105.12]  you know what,
[4105.18 --> 4105.82]  God did that work
[4105.82 --> 4106.22]  at the beginning
[4106.22 --> 4107.58]  but now it's my turn
[4107.58 --> 4108.24]  to do the work.
[4108.68 --> 4110.20]  I'll take control back.
[4110.36 --> 4110.78]  Thank you.
[4112.48 --> 4113.54]  But the Bible teaches
[4113.54 --> 4114.90]  over and over
[4114.90 --> 4115.60]  and over again
[4115.60 --> 4117.34]  and with such clarity
[4117.34 --> 4118.24]  and beauty
[4118.24 --> 4119.58]  that all of it,
[4119.66 --> 4120.50]  all of this
[4120.50 --> 4121.66]  requires you
[4121.66 --> 4123.10]  being in Christ,
[4123.26 --> 4124.50]  believing in Christ
[4124.50 --> 4125.88]  both as the object
[4125.88 --> 4126.84]  of your belief
[4126.84 --> 4128.02]  and the source
[4128.02 --> 4129.18]  of your belief.
[4129.88 --> 4130.88]  Both as the goal
[4130.88 --> 4132.04]  towards which we press
[4132.04 --> 4133.08]  and as the one
[4133.08 --> 4133.98]  who moves us
[4133.98 --> 4134.84]  in that direction.
[4134.84 --> 4138.78]  Let me illustrate it
[4138.78 --> 4139.58]  this way.
[4142.16 --> 4143.74]  You believe
[4143.74 --> 4145.50]  in the ocean
[4145.50 --> 4146.76]  differently
[4146.76 --> 4148.44]  when you're standing
[4148.44 --> 4149.68]  on the beach
[4149.68 --> 4151.72]  looking abstractly
[4151.72 --> 4152.32]  over it.
[4153.46 --> 4153.88]  Right?
[4153.94 --> 4154.54]  There's one way
[4154.54 --> 4155.10]  of believing
[4155.10 --> 4155.92]  and experiencing
[4155.92 --> 4156.52]  the ocean.
[4156.90 --> 4157.66]  But you believe
[4157.66 --> 4158.28]  differently
[4158.28 --> 4159.54]  about the ocean
[4159.54 --> 4160.34]  when you're sitting
[4160.34 --> 4160.84]  on the edge
[4160.84 --> 4161.34]  of a boat
[4161.34 --> 4162.32]  and you're dipping
[4162.32 --> 4163.20]  your feet in the water.
[4164.58 --> 4164.82]  Right?
[4165.04 --> 4165.62]  That's a different
[4165.62 --> 4166.32]  experience
[4166.32 --> 4167.08]  and belief
[4167.08 --> 4167.68]  of the ocean.
[4168.26 --> 4168.58]  Likewise,
[4168.80 --> 4169.34]  you believe
[4169.34 --> 4170.54]  yet again differently
[4170.54 --> 4171.68]  when you're swimming
[4171.68 --> 4172.74]  through the ocean
[4172.74 --> 4173.38]  on the surface
[4173.38 --> 4174.24]  and every once in a while
[4174.24 --> 4174.92]  you look down
[4174.92 --> 4176.08]  and see what it is
[4176.08 --> 4176.58]  that you see.
[4177.72 --> 4179.14]  And you believe
[4179.14 --> 4179.80]  differently
[4179.80 --> 4180.64]  when you are
[4180.64 --> 4181.44]  200 meters
[4181.44 --> 4182.38]  below the surface
[4182.38 --> 4183.70]  and all you feel
[4183.70 --> 4184.44]  is the weight
[4184.44 --> 4185.68]  of glory
[4185.68 --> 4186.98]  surrounding you,
[4187.14 --> 4188.14]  pressing in on you
[4188.14 --> 4189.32]  from every direction.
[4191.22 --> 4192.72]  Being in Christ
[4192.72 --> 4195.12]  moves you
[4195.12 --> 4196.22]  deeper.
[4197.50 --> 4198.92]  Being in Christ
[4198.92 --> 4200.28]  moves you
[4200.28 --> 4200.98]  deeper.
[4201.18 --> 4201.66]  And so are you
[4201.66 --> 4202.64]  standing on the beach?
[4203.74 --> 4204.72]  Are you dipping
[4204.72 --> 4205.40]  your toes
[4205.40 --> 4206.58]  into the water?
[4206.70 --> 4207.24]  Are you swimming
[4207.24 --> 4208.18]  along the surface
[4208.18 --> 4209.06]  or will you
[4209.06 --> 4210.46]  go deeper?
[4211.50 --> 4212.68]  Life in Christ
[4212.68 --> 4213.20]  Jesus
[4213.20 --> 4214.36]  is life
[4214.36 --> 4214.96]  drenched
[4214.96 --> 4215.70]  deep
[4215.70 --> 4217.30]  in the Holy Spirit.
[4218.86 --> 4218.98]  Right?
[4219.00 --> 4219.40]  And as I said,
[4219.44 --> 4220.10]  that's the banner
[4220.10 --> 4221.18]  over this text
[4221.18 --> 4221.76]  and I'm getting
[4221.76 --> 4222.42]  that language
[4222.42 --> 4224.42]  from verse 19
[4224.42 --> 4225.42]  where we read
[4225.42 --> 4226.30]  do not quench
[4226.30 --> 4227.24]  the Spirit.
[4227.98 --> 4229.04]  And instead of quench,
[4229.54 --> 4229.72]  right,
[4229.96 --> 4231.04]  this is what a
[4231.04 --> 4232.12]  Spirit-drenched
[4232.12 --> 4233.88]  life looks like.
[4234.66 --> 4235.42]  Or to put it
[4235.42 --> 4235.98]  another way,
[4236.30 --> 4237.14]  this is what it looks
[4237.14 --> 4238.38]  like to be on fire
[4238.38 --> 4239.16]  for the Lord
[4239.16 --> 4239.84]  by the Spirit.
[4240.02 --> 4240.72]  And yes,
[4240.78 --> 4241.50]  I get that I'm mixing
[4241.50 --> 4242.64]  opposite metaphors now.
[4244.32 --> 4245.30]  This is what
[4245.30 --> 4246.24]  life filled
[4246.24 --> 4247.20]  with the Spirit
[4247.20 --> 4248.08]  because you are
[4248.08 --> 4248.64]  in Christ
[4248.64 --> 4249.34]  looks like.
[4250.34 --> 4250.80]  Right?
[4250.84 --> 4251.62]  And in that life
[4251.62 --> 4252.16]  there are things
[4252.16 --> 4252.88]  that we are called
[4252.88 --> 4253.46]  to do
[4253.46 --> 4254.20]  and things
[4254.20 --> 4254.94]  that we are called
[4254.94 --> 4256.00]  not to do.
[4256.26 --> 4257.20]  There are do's
[4257.20 --> 4258.46]  and there are don'ts.
[4258.50 --> 4258.78]  And again,
[4258.88 --> 4259.76]  let's be abundantly
[4259.76 --> 4260.96]  clear about this,
[4261.04 --> 4261.14]  right?
[4261.18 --> 4262.20]  Because the do's
[4262.20 --> 4263.50]  are for your good
[4263.50 --> 4264.74]  and for God's glory
[4264.74 --> 4266.28]  and the don'ts
[4266.28 --> 4267.48]  are for your good
[4267.48 --> 4268.68]  and for God's glory.
[4269.76 --> 4269.84]  Right?
[4269.96 --> 4270.72]  Enjoying God,
[4270.88 --> 4271.50]  worshiping Him,
[4271.62 --> 4272.42]  living in the comfort
[4272.42 --> 4273.00]  of the gospel,
[4273.40 --> 4274.84]  living out our gratitude
[4274.84 --> 4276.56]  means yes and amen
[4276.56 --> 4277.98]  and it means
[4277.98 --> 4278.42]  no,
[4278.62 --> 4279.42]  not for me.
[4280.70 --> 4281.86]  Both of those
[4281.86 --> 4283.18]  are for your good,
[4283.48 --> 4284.52]  for your comfort,
[4284.96 --> 4286.10]  and are for your joy.
[4287.32 --> 4288.70]  This is two sides
[4288.70 --> 4289.68]  of one life
[4289.68 --> 4291.06]  lived in Christ,
[4291.22 --> 4291.68]  drenched
[4291.68 --> 4293.50]  in the Holy Spirit.
[4294.50 --> 4295.58]  And there's one more thing
[4295.58 --> 4296.72]  I want us to see
[4296.72 --> 4297.60]  before we quickly
[4297.60 --> 4298.82]  walk through
[4298.82 --> 4300.40]  this life lived in Christ.
[4300.40 --> 4302.26]  remember
[4302.26 --> 4304.22]  why Paul
[4304.22 --> 4305.52]  is writing this letter.
[4306.44 --> 4306.66]  Right?
[4306.66 --> 4307.62]  If you haven't been with us,
[4307.68 --> 4308.86]  let me recap you,
[4308.92 --> 4309.04]  right?
[4309.24 --> 4310.72]  Paul is writing this letter
[4310.72 --> 4311.66]  to encourage
[4311.66 --> 4313.88]  the Thessalonian believers,
[4314.08 --> 4315.18]  this young church
[4315.18 --> 4317.12]  who's been existing
[4317.12 --> 4318.30]  only for just
[4318.30 --> 4319.02]  a couple months
[4319.02 --> 4319.54]  by the time
[4319.54 --> 4320.50]  he writes this letter
[4320.50 --> 4322.08]  and in those
[4322.08 --> 4322.82]  couple months
[4322.82 --> 4323.80]  they have had to face
[4323.80 --> 4324.94]  incredible hardship,
[4325.42 --> 4326.32]  incredible persecution,
[4326.78 --> 4328.20]  and even death
[4328.20 --> 4329.26]  of their fellow
[4329.26 --> 4330.28]  brothers and sisters
[4330.28 --> 4330.86]  in Christ.
[4331.30 --> 4332.66]  Life in Jesus Christ
[4332.66 --> 4334.02]  has not been easy
[4334.02 --> 4334.62]  for them.
[4334.84 --> 4335.94]  It's not been safe
[4335.94 --> 4336.62]  for them.
[4336.84 --> 4338.00]  It's been costing them
[4338.00 --> 4338.64]  relationships.
[4339.06 --> 4340.46]  It's been costing them money.
[4340.74 --> 4341.98]  Remember at the very beginning
[4341.98 --> 4343.16]  Jason,
[4343.40 --> 4344.12]  one of the leaders
[4344.12 --> 4344.70]  in the church
[4344.70 --> 4345.78]  in Thessalonica,
[4346.02 --> 4347.34]  had to pay a fine
[4347.34 --> 4348.52]  to the city officials
[4348.52 --> 4349.88]  before he could be released
[4349.88 --> 4350.90]  after being arrested.
[4352.38 --> 4352.56]  Right?
[4352.62 --> 4353.30]  These Christians
[4353.30 --> 4354.50]  are doing things
[4354.50 --> 4355.70]  that their non-Christian
[4355.70 --> 4356.32]  neighbors
[4356.32 --> 4357.92]  think are super weird.
[4358.98 --> 4359.46]  Some of them
[4359.46 --> 4360.50]  are even destructive
[4360.50 --> 4361.34]  practices.
[4361.92 --> 4362.02]  Right?
[4362.08 --> 4363.28]  Destructive to the peace
[4363.28 --> 4364.52]  and the social order
[4364.52 --> 4365.50]  of Thessalonica.
[4365.60 --> 4366.56]  It doesn't make sense
[4366.56 --> 4367.00]  to them.
[4368.70 --> 4369.62]  And when things
[4369.62 --> 4370.14]  are hard,
[4370.78 --> 4371.82]  God knows
[4371.82 --> 4373.08]  we need extra reminders.
[4373.88 --> 4375.26]  We need more encouragement
[4375.26 --> 4376.92]  when things get tough.
[4377.26 --> 4379.28]  That's what this letter is.
[4379.44 --> 4380.52]  How do we live
[4380.52 --> 4381.36]  in Christ
[4381.36 --> 4382.36]  when things are hard?
[4382.36 --> 4384.52]  How do we live
[4384.52 --> 4385.76]  drenched in the Spirit
[4385.76 --> 4387.96]  when our very circumstances
[4387.96 --> 4389.60]  could discourage
[4389.60 --> 4390.16]  our faith?
[4391.46 --> 4393.16]  It's precisely then
[4393.16 --> 4394.02]  that we read
[4394.02 --> 4395.74]  rejoice always.
[4397.24 --> 4398.52]  And hear this.
[4401.02 --> 4403.68]  If you
[4403.68 --> 4406.14]  are going to live
[4406.14 --> 4407.18]  in Christ
[4407.18 --> 4408.98]  doing God's will
[4408.98 --> 4410.26]  when it's hard,
[4410.26 --> 4412.24]  you need to have
[4412.24 --> 4412.70]  a reason
[4412.70 --> 4413.40]  to rejoice
[4413.40 --> 4415.00]  when your circumstances
[4415.00 --> 4416.04]  don't give you one.
[4418.00 --> 4418.56]  The way
[4418.56 --> 4419.18]  to live
[4419.18 --> 4419.96]  in Christ
[4419.96 --> 4420.92]  doing God's will
[4420.92 --> 4421.58]  when it's hard
[4421.58 --> 4422.20]  is to have
[4422.20 --> 4422.68]  a reason
[4422.68 --> 4423.40]  to rejoice
[4423.40 --> 4424.70]  when your immediate
[4424.70 --> 4425.46]  circumstances
[4425.46 --> 4426.98]  do not give you one.
[4428.72 --> 4429.42]  For that
[4429.42 --> 4430.00]  as an example
[4430.00 --> 4430.48]  of this
[4430.48 --> 4431.72]  from the Bible
[4431.72 --> 4432.46]  I think of the story
[4432.46 --> 4432.90]  of Job.
[4433.16 --> 4434.02]  Many of you are familiar
[4434.02 --> 4435.00]  with Job's story.
[4435.72 --> 4435.84]  Right?
[4435.88 --> 4436.44]  He lost
[4436.44 --> 4437.42]  everything.
[4437.42 --> 4439.30]  But Job said
[4439.30 --> 4440.90]  shall we accept
[4440.90 --> 4441.80]  good from God
[4441.80 --> 4442.80]  and not trouble?
[4444.10 --> 4445.14]  He also says
[4445.14 --> 4446.14]  the Lord gave
[4446.14 --> 4446.66]  and the Lord
[4446.66 --> 4447.52]  has taken away
[4447.52 --> 4448.70]  may the name
[4448.70 --> 4449.30]  of the Lord
[4449.30 --> 4449.98]  be praised.
[4451.44 --> 4451.58]  Right?
[4451.62 --> 4452.14]  May the name
[4452.14 --> 4452.60]  of the Lord
[4452.60 --> 4453.24]  be praised
[4453.24 --> 4453.86]  in trouble
[4453.86 --> 4454.86]  and when he
[4454.86 --> 4455.44]  takes away.
[4456.98 --> 4457.10]  Right?
[4457.12 --> 4457.50]  And for this
[4457.50 --> 4458.42]  I think of Christians
[4458.42 --> 4459.26]  who sing
[4459.26 --> 4460.56]  and more often
[4460.56 --> 4461.04]  than not
[4461.04 --> 4461.66]  these days
[4461.66 --> 4462.50]  it seems to be
[4462.50 --> 4463.28]  at funerals
[4463.28 --> 4464.00]  but we sing
[4464.00 --> 4465.00]  it is well
[4465.00 --> 4466.18]  with my soul.
[4466.18 --> 4467.48]  Right?
[4467.56 --> 4468.16]  Though Satan
[4468.16 --> 4468.74]  should buffet
[4468.74 --> 4469.68]  though trials
[4469.68 --> 4470.30]  should come
[4470.30 --> 4472.38]  Christ has regarded
[4472.38 --> 4473.78]  my helpless estate
[4473.78 --> 4475.06]  and we sing
[4475.06 --> 4475.78]  it is well
[4475.78 --> 4477.26]  with my soul.
[4477.80 --> 4478.50]  It is well
[4478.50 --> 4479.68]  it is well
[4479.68 --> 4480.76]  with my soul.
[4481.50 --> 4482.16]  In this church
[4482.16 --> 4482.78]  another song
[4482.78 --> 4483.80]  that we sing
[4483.80 --> 4484.68]  we sing
[4484.68 --> 4485.76]  when I fear
[4485.76 --> 4487.04]  my faith will fail
[4487.04 --> 4488.90]  when the tempter
[4488.90 --> 4489.74]  would prevail
[4489.74 --> 4491.14]  I could never
[4491.14 --> 4492.14]  keep my hold
[4492.14 --> 4493.82]  through life's
[4493.82 --> 4495.32]  fearful paths
[4495.32 --> 4497.66]  he will hold
[4497.66 --> 4498.26]  me fast.
[4500.02 --> 4500.54]  Right?
[4500.60 --> 4501.40]  We can rejoice
[4501.40 --> 4502.34]  in the hardship
[4502.34 --> 4503.46]  we can worship
[4503.46 --> 4504.32]  in the valley
[4504.32 --> 4504.94]  of the shadow
[4504.94 --> 4506.04]  we can sing
[4506.04 --> 4506.86]  in the face
[4506.86 --> 4507.40]  of death
[4507.40 --> 4508.24]  and every other
[4508.24 --> 4508.78]  circumstance
[4508.78 --> 4510.00]  because there is
[4510.00 --> 4511.10]  a yet greater
[4511.10 --> 4511.72]  circumstance
[4511.72 --> 4512.78]  that we are
[4512.78 --> 4513.38]  aware of.
[4513.46 --> 4513.58]  Amen?
[4514.58 --> 4514.78]  Right?
[4514.84 --> 4515.30]  There is a yet
[4515.30 --> 4516.34]  greater God
[4516.34 --> 4517.26]  whom we know
[4517.26 --> 4518.06]  who has invited
[4518.06 --> 4518.88]  us into himself
[4518.88 --> 4519.84]  and who has made
[4519.84 --> 4520.70]  us one with him
[4520.70 --> 4521.52]  in Christ Jesus.
[4521.52 --> 4523.24]  And again
[4523.24 --> 4524.00]  this is Job's
[4524.00 --> 4524.50]  hope.
[4524.64 --> 4525.10]  Job put it
[4525.10 --> 4525.58]  this way
[4525.58 --> 4526.32]  Job says
[4526.32 --> 4527.00]  I know
[4527.00 --> 4527.74]  that my
[4527.74 --> 4528.94]  redeemer lives
[4528.94 --> 4529.64]  and that in the
[4529.64 --> 4530.32]  end he will
[4530.32 --> 4531.02]  stand on the
[4531.02 --> 4531.28]  earth
[4531.28 --> 4532.26]  and after my
[4532.26 --> 4532.94]  skin has been
[4532.94 --> 4533.46]  destroyed
[4533.46 --> 4534.48]  yet in my
[4534.48 --> 4535.18]  flesh I
[4535.18 --> 4535.88]  will see
[4535.88 --> 4536.48]  God
[4536.48 --> 4537.40]  I myself
[4537.40 --> 4538.14]  will see him
[4538.14 --> 4538.78]  with my own
[4538.78 --> 4539.08]  eyes
[4539.08 --> 4540.02]  I and not
[4540.02 --> 4540.44]  another
[4540.44 --> 4541.30]  how my
[4541.30 --> 4541.80]  heart
[4541.80 --> 4542.68]  yearns
[4542.68 --> 4543.74]  within me.
[4545.26 --> 4546.34]  As Christians
[4546.34 --> 4547.54]  we have two
[4547.54 --> 4547.98]  reasons
[4547.98 --> 4549.08]  to rejoice
[4549.08 --> 4549.54]  that are
[4549.54 --> 4550.34]  greater than
[4550.34 --> 4551.18]  any circumstance
[4551.18 --> 4552.08]  we might face
[4552.08 --> 4552.58]  right now
[4552.58 --> 4553.30]  and those two
[4553.30 --> 4553.86]  reasons they
[4553.86 --> 4554.34]  really come
[4554.34 --> 4555.20]  together as
[4555.20 --> 4555.90]  one unified
[4555.90 --> 4556.76]  reason.
[4556.90 --> 4557.24]  We have the
[4557.24 --> 4558.00]  resurrection of
[4558.00 --> 4558.92]  Jesus yes and
[4558.92 --> 4560.00]  amen and we
[4560.00 --> 4561.04]  have his coming
[4561.04 --> 4562.68]  again to restore
[4562.68 --> 4564.08]  all things.
[4565.40 --> 4566.56]  And in fact if
[4566.56 --> 4567.02]  you've been with
[4567.02 --> 4567.80]  us in this series
[4567.80 --> 4568.44]  this has been
[4568.44 --> 4569.24]  chapters 4 and
[4569.24 --> 4570.22]  5 this has been
[4570.22 --> 4571.14]  the point building
[4571.14 --> 4571.88]  to this idea
[4571.88 --> 4572.96]  because of the
[4572.96 --> 4574.16]  coming return of
[4574.16 --> 4575.10]  Jesus because of
[4575.10 --> 4576.16]  his resurrection
[4576.16 --> 4578.00]  we can experience
[4578.00 --> 4579.10]  the defeat of
[4579.10 --> 4580.32]  sin and death
[4580.32 --> 4581.70]  in him.
[4582.48 --> 4583.08]  And because of
[4583.08 --> 4583.80]  that we can
[4583.80 --> 4585.62]  rejoice in
[4585.62 --> 4587.54]  every circumstance
[4587.54 --> 4588.98]  we can rejoice
[4588.98 --> 4590.20]  always.
[4591.20 --> 4592.40]  To be clear
[4592.40 --> 4593.30]  again
[4593.30 --> 4594.48]  rejoice
[4594.48 --> 4595.52]  always
[4595.52 --> 4596.36]  doesn't
[4596.36 --> 4597.06]  always
[4597.06 --> 4598.06]  or doesn't
[4598.06 --> 4598.86]  mean always
[4598.86 --> 4600.58]  feeling joyful
[4600.58 --> 4601.14]  doesn't mean
[4601.14 --> 4602.18]  always feeling
[4602.18 --> 4602.88]  happy and
[4602.88 --> 4603.48]  clappy and
[4603.48 --> 4604.06]  putting a good
[4604.06 --> 4604.86]  smile on
[4604.86 --> 4605.48]  when on the
[4605.48 --> 4606.04]  insides
[4606.04 --> 4606.74]  we're just
[4606.74 --> 4607.54]  chaotic and
[4607.54 --> 4608.06]  a mess.
[4608.06 --> 4610.54]  it means
[4610.54 --> 4611.72]  submitting your
[4611.72 --> 4612.84]  feelings to
[4612.84 --> 4613.44]  the truth of
[4613.44 --> 4613.92]  who Christ
[4613.92 --> 4614.26]  is.
[4614.90 --> 4615.58]  It means
[4615.58 --> 4616.42]  redefining your
[4616.42 --> 4617.10]  realities in
[4617.10 --> 4617.40]  light of the
[4617.40 --> 4617.78]  truth of the
[4617.78 --> 4618.10]  gospel.
[4618.26 --> 4618.74]  Thank you for
[4618.74 --> 4619.02]  that.
[4621.10 --> 4621.96]  It means
[4621.96 --> 4623.14]  trusting Christ
[4623.14 --> 4624.14]  and not your
[4624.14 --> 4624.58]  feelings.
[4625.96 --> 4627.10]  Rejoice always
[4627.10 --> 4628.34]  is to sing
[4628.34 --> 4629.18]  it is well
[4629.18 --> 4630.14]  with my soul.
[4631.40 --> 4631.88]  And there are
[4631.88 --> 4633.34]  times when we
[4633.34 --> 4633.92]  sing that
[4633.92 --> 4635.02]  aspirationally.
[4635.02 --> 4636.62]  we sing that
[4636.62 --> 4637.40]  longing to
[4637.40 --> 4638.02]  believe it's
[4638.02 --> 4638.34]  true.
[4639.70 --> 4640.44]  And there are
[4640.44 --> 4641.74]  times when we
[4641.74 --> 4642.46]  will sing that
[4642.46 --> 4643.16]  as the most
[4643.16 --> 4643.84]  decisive
[4643.84 --> 4645.28]  declaration of
[4645.28 --> 4645.96]  our faith in
[4645.96 --> 4646.52]  the midst of
[4646.52 --> 4647.36]  whatever dark
[4647.36 --> 4647.84]  night of the
[4647.84 --> 4648.78]  soul you are
[4648.78 --> 4649.16]  facing.
[4650.00 --> 4650.78]  And then there
[4650.78 --> 4651.98]  are times where
[4651.98 --> 4652.50]  you won't be able
[4652.50 --> 4652.96]  to say those
[4652.96 --> 4653.24]  words.
[4654.58 --> 4655.60]  And so we rely
[4655.60 --> 4656.06]  on the brothers
[4656.06 --> 4656.84]  and sisters around
[4656.84 --> 4658.30]  us to sing them
[4658.30 --> 4659.34]  for us and
[4659.34 --> 4660.04]  over us.
[4660.64 --> 4661.70]  To rejoice
[4661.70 --> 4663.52]  always on our
[4663.52 --> 4663.94]  behalf.
[4663.94 --> 4665.92]  wherever you
[4665.92 --> 4666.66]  are on the
[4666.66 --> 4667.34]  spectrum of
[4667.34 --> 4668.40]  confidence this
[4668.40 --> 4669.22]  is part of
[4669.22 --> 4669.78]  what it means
[4669.78 --> 4671.18]  to live in
[4671.18 --> 4672.10]  Christ.
[4673.22 --> 4674.26]  And it means
[4674.26 --> 4675.18]  right to pray
[4675.18 --> 4676.20]  continually and
[4676.20 --> 4677.64]  give thanks in
[4677.64 --> 4678.74]  all circumstances.
[4679.52 --> 4680.96]  Both forms of
[4680.96 --> 4681.24]  prayer.
[4681.64 --> 4682.34]  You are invited
[4682.34 --> 4683.64]  to pray without
[4683.64 --> 4685.14]  ceasing to speak
[4685.14 --> 4685.88]  to your heavenly
[4685.88 --> 4687.00]  father because you
[4687.00 --> 4687.92]  are in the
[4687.92 --> 4688.32]  son.
[4690.02 --> 4690.78]  Right you don't
[4690.78 --> 4691.96]  need systems or
[4691.96 --> 4693.16]  mediators other
[4693.16 --> 4694.14]  than Christ
[4694.14 --> 4695.08]  himself.
[4695.26 --> 4695.88]  It's God's
[4695.88 --> 4696.58]  will that you
[4696.58 --> 4697.14]  should come to
[4697.14 --> 4699.00]  him in prayer
[4699.00 --> 4700.32]  just as Jesus
[4700.32 --> 4701.28]  did.
[4702.78 --> 4703.88]  Sometimes our
[4703.88 --> 4704.86]  prayer and
[4704.86 --> 4705.76]  praying means
[4705.76 --> 4706.74]  inviting God
[4706.74 --> 4707.30]  into the
[4707.30 --> 4708.62]  minutia of your
[4708.62 --> 4708.98]  life.
[4709.20 --> 4710.34]  Sometimes our
[4710.34 --> 4711.06]  prayer is
[4711.06 --> 4712.04]  pleading with
[4712.04 --> 4712.88]  God and
[4712.88 --> 4713.92]  sometimes our
[4713.92 --> 4714.42]  prayer is
[4714.42 --> 4715.54]  sitting still
[4715.54 --> 4716.70]  and listening
[4716.70 --> 4718.08]  for his voice.
[4719.16 --> 4720.48]  Resting in the
[4720.48 --> 4721.14]  one who said
[4721.14 --> 4721.72]  come to me
[4721.72 --> 4722.30]  all who are
[4722.30 --> 4722.76]  weary and
[4722.76 --> 4723.28]  heavy laden
[4723.28 --> 4723.76]  and I will
[4723.76 --> 4724.34]  give you
[4724.34 --> 4725.38]  rest.
[4726.14 --> 4727.36]  Sometimes our
[4727.36 --> 4728.20]  praying means
[4728.20 --> 4729.10]  opening up
[4729.10 --> 4730.26]  these scriptures
[4730.26 --> 4731.10]  and praying
[4731.10 --> 4732.20]  these words
[4732.20 --> 4733.58]  as our
[4733.58 --> 4734.10]  words,
[4734.22 --> 4735.16]  God's words
[4735.16 --> 4735.98]  on your own
[4735.98 --> 4736.60]  lips and out
[4736.60 --> 4737.16]  of your own
[4737.16 --> 4737.56]  heart.
[4738.08 --> 4739.18]  Sometimes praying
[4739.18 --> 4740.56]  means turning
[4740.56 --> 4741.74]  your groanings
[4741.74 --> 4743.02]  into gratitude.
[4745.56 --> 4746.36]  Someone once
[4746.36 --> 4747.72]  said you can't
[4747.72 --> 4749.04]  be angry when
[4749.04 --> 4749.58]  you're grateful.
[4751.90 --> 4752.26]  Now again,
[4752.32 --> 4752.78]  let me be really
[4752.78 --> 4753.84]  clear, right?
[4753.92 --> 4754.44]  Because I think
[4754.44 --> 4755.14]  the preposition
[4755.14 --> 4756.44]  matters here
[4756.44 --> 4756.98]  too.
[4757.16 --> 4757.84]  We are invited
[4757.84 --> 4758.80]  to give thanks
[4758.80 --> 4760.32]  in all
[4760.32 --> 4761.04]  circumstances,
[4761.34 --> 4762.66]  not for all
[4762.66 --> 4763.28]  circumstances.
[4764.48 --> 4765.36]  The reality of
[4765.36 --> 4765.98]  sin in our
[4765.98 --> 4766.96]  world grieves
[4766.96 --> 4767.92]  God's heart
[4767.92 --> 4768.88]  and that means
[4768.88 --> 4769.26]  there are
[4769.26 --> 4769.98]  circumstances
[4769.98 --> 4771.42]  where we
[4771.42 --> 4772.20]  should not
[4772.20 --> 4773.32]  be but for
[4773.32 --> 4774.58]  sin or sinning
[4774.58 --> 4775.44]  or sinfulness
[4775.44 --> 4776.40]  in the world
[4776.40 --> 4777.04]  around us and
[4777.04 --> 4778.14]  affecting our
[4778.14 --> 4779.28]  local areas,
[4779.54 --> 4779.82]  spheres,
[4780.04 --> 4780.52]  and lives.
[4781.28 --> 4782.04]  We don't need
[4782.04 --> 4782.90]  to thank God
[4782.90 --> 4783.42]  for this
[4783.42 --> 4784.68]  situation but
[4784.68 --> 4785.84]  we can thank
[4785.84 --> 4786.44]  him for the
[4786.44 --> 4787.36]  promise to
[4787.36 --> 4788.56]  sustain us in
[4788.56 --> 4789.10]  the midst of
[4789.10 --> 4789.30]  it.
[4791.40 --> 4792.32]  So just like
[4792.32 --> 4792.98]  we have reason
[4792.98 --> 4794.54]  to rejoice even
[4794.54 --> 4794.98]  when our
[4794.98 --> 4795.96]  circumstances don't
[4795.96 --> 4796.62]  give us one,
[4796.86 --> 4797.78]  we have reason
[4797.78 --> 4798.62]  to be thankful
[4798.62 --> 4799.48]  even when our
[4799.48 --> 4800.80]  circumstances don't
[4800.80 --> 4801.92]  give us one.
[4802.40 --> 4803.28]  Again, we read
[4803.28 --> 4804.52]  in Romans 8,
[4804.60 --> 4805.06]  28,
[4805.06 --> 4806.68]  we know that
[4806.68 --> 4807.44]  in all things
[4807.44 --> 4808.24]  God works for
[4808.24 --> 4808.78]  the good of
[4808.78 --> 4809.46]  those who love
[4809.46 --> 4810.24]  him, who have
[4810.24 --> 4810.76]  been called
[4810.76 --> 4811.70]  according to
[4811.70 --> 4812.36]  his purpose.
[4813.36 --> 4814.14]  And if all
[4814.14 --> 4815.00]  things really
[4815.00 --> 4815.82]  means all
[4815.82 --> 4816.64]  things, and I
[4816.64 --> 4817.30]  believe it does,
[4817.96 --> 4818.70]  then we can
[4818.70 --> 4819.80]  give thanks in
[4819.80 --> 4821.12]  all things because
[4821.12 --> 4822.26]  God is working
[4822.26 --> 4823.82]  all things, even
[4823.82 --> 4824.74]  that particular
[4824.74 --> 4825.78]  awful thing,
[4826.10 --> 4826.96]  for good.
[4827.94 --> 4829.76]  Now, it may be
[4829.76 --> 4830.74]  that that good
[4830.74 --> 4831.66]  doesn't come to
[4831.66 --> 4832.62]  us until the
[4832.62 --> 4833.32]  world to come.
[4833.32 --> 4834.20]  Remember, our
[4834.20 --> 4834.80]  hope is in the
[4834.80 --> 4835.52]  resurrection and
[4835.52 --> 4836.14]  in the return of
[4836.14 --> 4836.74]  Jesus Christ?
[4837.92 --> 4839.68]  But even if it's
[4839.68 --> 4841.14]  not good until the
[4841.14 --> 4842.18]  return of Jesus
[4842.18 --> 4843.42]  Christ, it is all
[4843.42 --> 4844.52]  the greater for it.
[4845.58 --> 4846.62]  And if you believe
[4846.62 --> 4848.32]  that, you can
[4848.32 --> 4849.28]  really genuinely
[4849.28 --> 4850.44]  give thanks in
[4850.44 --> 4851.98]  every circumstance.
[4854.02 --> 4855.20]  And so we dig.
[4855.50 --> 4856.02]  In the next
[4856.02 --> 4856.58]  section, we're
[4856.58 --> 4857.42]  given some
[4857.42 --> 4858.62]  negative imperatives.
[4858.94 --> 4859.50]  If the first
[4859.50 --> 4860.50]  part are do's,
[4860.90 --> 4862.48]  the second is
[4862.48 --> 4863.32]  don'ts.
[4863.36 --> 4863.88]  And we begin
[4863.88 --> 4864.62]  where we started,
[4864.78 --> 4865.58]  do not quench
[4865.58 --> 4866.70]  the Spirit.
[4867.80 --> 4868.96]  Now, this means
[4868.96 --> 4870.12]  do not resist
[4870.12 --> 4871.18]  the Spirit's
[4871.18 --> 4871.76]  work.
[4872.58 --> 4873.48]  On the day of
[4873.48 --> 4874.34]  Pentecost, many
[4874.34 --> 4874.96]  of you will know
[4874.96 --> 4876.02]  this, the Holy
[4876.02 --> 4877.18]  Spirit came down
[4877.18 --> 4878.14]  on the disciples
[4878.14 --> 4880.40]  in displays of
[4880.40 --> 4881.48]  tongues of fire.
[4882.16 --> 4882.64]  So the Holy
[4882.64 --> 4883.34]  Spirit is like a
[4883.34 --> 4884.52]  fire, and in this
[4884.52 --> 4885.50]  text, we are told
[4885.50 --> 4886.88]  not to extinguish
[4886.88 --> 4887.94]  that fire.
[4887.94 --> 4887.98]  fire.
[4889.76 --> 4890.66]  One of the most
[4890.66 --> 4891.90]  common ways that
[4891.90 --> 4892.70]  the Holy Spirit
[4892.70 --> 4894.40]  is at work among
[4894.40 --> 4896.04]  us is also one of
[4896.04 --> 4896.68]  the most ordinary
[4896.68 --> 4898.68]  ways, and that's
[4898.68 --> 4899.24]  in the conviction
[4899.24 --> 4899.74]  of sin.
[4900.78 --> 4901.82]  The Holy Spirit
[4901.82 --> 4903.08]  is always at work
[4903.08 --> 4904.28]  to produce a
[4904.28 --> 4905.26]  conviction of sin
[4905.26 --> 4906.26]  that leads to
[4906.26 --> 4906.76]  repentance.
[4908.04 --> 4908.90]  And if the Spirit
[4908.90 --> 4909.58]  is at work
[4909.58 --> 4910.62]  convicting you of
[4910.62 --> 4911.70]  sin, the next
[4911.70 --> 4912.72]  step isn't to
[4912.72 --> 4913.50]  tamp it down,
[4913.64 --> 4914.60]  isn't to extinguish
[4914.60 --> 4915.64]  it, isn't to say,
[4915.72 --> 4916.38]  ah, you know, it's
[4916.38 --> 4917.08]  not actually that
[4917.08 --> 4917.34]  bad.
[4918.04 --> 4919.02]  It's to confess.
[4920.02 --> 4920.78]  It's to repent.
[4921.58 --> 4922.42]  It's to lay it
[4922.42 --> 4923.42]  before the cross
[4923.42 --> 4924.06]  of our Savior,
[4924.20 --> 4924.68]  Jesus Christ,
[4924.72 --> 4925.48]  because that's
[4925.48 --> 4926.24]  precisely where
[4926.24 --> 4927.32]  He died for
[4927.32 --> 4928.52]  these sins.
[4933.40 --> 4934.40]  It has been my
[4934.40 --> 4935.30]  experience in the
[4935.30 --> 4936.08]  last number of
[4936.08 --> 4938.28]  months, the Holy
[4938.28 --> 4940.54]  Spirit is doing
[4940.54 --> 4942.70]  a work among us
[4942.70 --> 4944.70]  in the area of
[4944.70 --> 4945.24]  confession and
[4945.24 --> 4945.54]  repentance.
[4946.38 --> 4947.96]  that people have
[4947.96 --> 4948.62]  been opening up
[4948.62 --> 4949.20]  to one another
[4949.20 --> 4950.74]  and confessing
[4950.74 --> 4951.64]  and seeking help
[4951.64 --> 4952.66]  and walking with
[4952.66 --> 4953.56]  people in the
[4953.56 --> 4954.20]  midst of struggle.
[4954.74 --> 4955.28]  And I had a
[4955.28 --> 4956.02]  gathering with a
[4956.02 --> 4956.74]  group of pastors
[4956.74 --> 4957.52]  from Langley
[4957.52 --> 4958.40]  this week,
[4959.04 --> 4960.12]  and I was
[4960.12 --> 4960.76]  sharing that I
[4960.76 --> 4961.60]  feel like the
[4961.60 --> 4962.24]  Spirit is leading
[4962.24 --> 4962.72]  in this,
[4963.08 --> 4964.20]  and to a person
[4964.20 --> 4965.06]  around the room,
[4965.30 --> 4965.92]  every other
[4965.92 --> 4966.80]  pastor confirmed
[4966.80 --> 4967.62]  the same thing.
[4968.84 --> 4969.32]  He said,
[4969.46 --> 4970.06]  I haven't been
[4970.06 --> 4970.62]  able to put my
[4970.62 --> 4971.08]  finger on it,
[4971.10 --> 4971.66]  but that's exactly
[4971.66 --> 4972.16]  what's happening
[4972.16 --> 4972.80]  in our life in
[4972.80 --> 4973.18]  ministry.
[4973.18 --> 4975.22]  just before I
[4975.22 --> 4975.64]  came here,
[4975.72 --> 4976.42]  someone came in
[4976.42 --> 4976.72]  and said,
[4976.78 --> 4977.32]  I need help in
[4977.32 --> 4977.76]  this area,
[4978.08 --> 4979.30]  please help me
[4979.30 --> 4980.16]  find the forgiveness
[4980.16 --> 4980.92]  of God and live.
[4981.62 --> 4982.36]  The Spirit is at
[4982.36 --> 4983.70]  work convicting us
[4983.70 --> 4984.74]  and drawing us
[4984.74 --> 4986.64]  into Christ Jesus.
[4988.24 --> 4988.90]  And make no
[4988.90 --> 4989.62]  mistake about it,
[4989.64 --> 4989.80]  right?
[4989.86 --> 4991.12]  Everyone who lives
[4991.12 --> 4992.98]  in Christ has the
[4992.98 --> 4994.28]  Holy Spirit and has
[4994.28 --> 4995.24]  then been given a
[4995.24 --> 4996.48]  Holy Spirit purpose,
[4996.70 --> 4997.80]  a gift to serve
[4997.80 --> 4998.76]  and to edify the
[4998.76 --> 4999.14]  church.
[4999.14 --> 5000.62]  And if you
[5000.62 --> 5001.86]  resist that gift,
[5002.78 --> 5003.78]  if you are stubborn
[5003.78 --> 5004.92]  in becoming part of
[5004.92 --> 5005.60]  the fellowship of
[5005.60 --> 5006.40]  believers and working
[5006.40 --> 5006.98]  to build up the
[5006.98 --> 5008.64]  body, you're
[5008.64 --> 5009.18]  quenching the
[5009.18 --> 5009.42]  Spirit.
[5013.12 --> 5014.04]  Someone comes up
[5014.04 --> 5014.90]  to you and says,
[5015.28 --> 5017.20]  I believe that God
[5017.20 --> 5018.10]  has gifted you in
[5018.10 --> 5020.16]  this way and that
[5020.16 --> 5020.62]  you should do
[5020.62 --> 5021.52]  something about it.
[5021.68 --> 5022.12]  Or here's an
[5022.12 --> 5023.02]  opportunity to do
[5023.02 --> 5023.92]  something with what
[5023.92 --> 5024.60]  I believe God has
[5024.60 --> 5025.26]  gifted you.
[5027.12 --> 5027.94]  And you,
[5027.94 --> 5029.62]  presenting a false
[5029.62 --> 5031.10]  humility, respond by
[5031.10 --> 5032.12]  saying, no, not me,
[5032.20 --> 5032.88]  I could never do
[5032.88 --> 5033.16]  that.
[5034.14 --> 5034.90]  You might be
[5034.90 --> 5035.34]  quenching the
[5035.34 --> 5035.56]  Spirit.
[5038.48 --> 5040.14]  Equally, if you are
[5040.14 --> 5041.42]  utterly convinced in
[5041.42 --> 5042.54]  yourself that you have
[5042.54 --> 5043.06]  been given a
[5043.06 --> 5044.38]  particular gift, but no
[5044.38 --> 5045.06]  one in your life has
[5045.06 --> 5045.98]  affirmed it, no one
[5045.98 --> 5046.88]  has come alongside and
[5046.88 --> 5048.06]  said, hey, I wonder if
[5048.06 --> 5049.18]  God is calling you into
[5049.18 --> 5049.72]  this.
[5051.66 --> 5052.86]  And if these people
[5052.86 --> 5053.86]  have perhaps even
[5053.86 --> 5055.22]  tried to dissuade you
[5055.22 --> 5056.70]  from that idea, but
[5056.70 --> 5057.42]  you are pressing
[5057.42 --> 5059.26]  forward, you might be
[5059.26 --> 5059.92]  quenching the Spirit
[5059.92 --> 5060.28]  in them.
[5062.28 --> 5063.48]  Do not quench the
[5063.48 --> 5063.78]  Spirit.
[5064.86 --> 5066.08]  Instead, fan the
[5066.08 --> 5067.48]  flame, or to stick
[5067.48 --> 5068.04]  with our mixed
[5068.04 --> 5069.56]  metaphor, dive deep
[5069.56 --> 5070.56]  into the ocean.
[5072.88 --> 5073.88]  Do not treat
[5073.88 --> 5075.12]  prophecies with
[5075.12 --> 5075.62]  contempt.
[5078.04 --> 5078.90]  Now, Paul regularly
[5078.90 --> 5079.92]  warns his readers
[5079.92 --> 5081.18]  about false prophets
[5081.18 --> 5082.64]  and about wolves
[5082.64 --> 5084.58]  disguised as sheep
[5084.58 --> 5085.84]  and as shepherds.
[5085.84 --> 5086.84]  false prophets.
[5086.84 --> 5088.12]  And because of that,
[5088.62 --> 5089.70]  right, because of that
[5089.70 --> 5090.88]  regular warning, and
[5090.88 --> 5091.98]  because we have seen it
[5091.98 --> 5092.68]  and some of us have been
[5092.68 --> 5094.24]  burned by it, right, there
[5094.24 --> 5096.32]  is a possibility, maybe
[5096.32 --> 5097.76]  even a tendency, to fall
[5097.76 --> 5098.60]  into cynicism.
[5100.38 --> 5101.60]  All Christians are
[5101.60 --> 5102.10]  hypocrites.
[5102.78 --> 5104.16]  All pastors are con
[5104.16 --> 5104.52]  artists.
[5104.52 --> 5104.62]  prophets.
[5105.30 --> 5109.54]  But the reality is, God
[5109.54 --> 5111.68]  has spoken and is
[5111.68 --> 5113.94]  speaking through prophets.
[5114.48 --> 5116.22]  God has given his voice
[5116.22 --> 5118.10]  to people to declare his
[5118.10 --> 5120.24]  word and his will, either
[5120.24 --> 5121.42]  in an extraordinary
[5121.42 --> 5123.34]  revelation of God or as
[5123.34 --> 5124.36]  part of the ordinary
[5124.36 --> 5125.88]  revelation of God in the
[5125.88 --> 5127.16]  preaching of his word.
[5127.36 --> 5128.86]  And those who live in
[5128.86 --> 5130.90]  Christ Jesus will test
[5130.90 --> 5131.62]  them all.
[5131.62 --> 5132.62]  Right?
[5133.58 --> 5134.48]  We won't dive into
[5134.48 --> 5136.34]  cynicism, but test
[5136.34 --> 5137.26]  them all means a
[5137.26 --> 5138.08]  healthy dose of
[5138.08 --> 5139.40]  skepticism isn't so
[5139.40 --> 5139.72]  bad.
[5140.34 --> 5140.56]  Right?
[5140.58 --> 5141.34]  It can guard your
[5141.34 --> 5142.58]  hearts from those who
[5142.58 --> 5143.70]  would take advantage of
[5143.70 --> 5144.40]  you or who would
[5144.40 --> 5145.58]  spiritually abuse you.
[5146.40 --> 5147.48]  And so here, as I
[5147.48 --> 5148.68]  stand on stage, I
[5148.68 --> 5149.86]  invite you, test
[5149.86 --> 5151.60]  this spirit.
[5152.32 --> 5153.48]  Test this
[5153.48 --> 5153.62]  word.
[5154.38 --> 5155.24]  Test this
[5155.24 --> 5156.12]  message.
[5156.34 --> 5157.64]  Invite the
[5157.64 --> 5158.74]  spirit to show you
[5158.74 --> 5160.04]  how it is the voice
[5160.04 --> 5161.32]  of God speaking.
[5162.68 --> 5163.46]  And here's a quick
[5163.46 --> 5164.30]  tip for you who want
[5164.30 --> 5165.22]  to follow up on that,
[5165.46 --> 5166.24]  who want to test
[5166.24 --> 5167.04]  prophecy.
[5168.24 --> 5169.42]  Jesus Christ is the
[5169.42 --> 5170.78]  same yesterday, today,
[5170.78 --> 5171.66]  and tomorrow.
[5172.78 --> 5174.42]  God is unchanging.
[5175.02 --> 5176.04]  God's word is
[5176.04 --> 5176.60]  eternal.
[5177.52 --> 5178.90]  And so, God will
[5178.90 --> 5180.32]  never contradict
[5180.32 --> 5181.66]  himself or speak
[5181.66 --> 5182.20]  wrongly.
[5183.30 --> 5183.50]  Right?
[5183.58 --> 5184.78]  Any new movement of
[5184.78 --> 5186.48]  the spirit will be a
[5186.48 --> 5187.70]  revival of the old,
[5187.78 --> 5188.26]  old story.
[5188.26 --> 5190.66]  And if you hear a
[5190.66 --> 5191.72]  prophet who tries to
[5191.72 --> 5193.04]  dismiss a word of God
[5193.04 --> 5193.90]  from the Bible as
[5193.90 --> 5195.94]  outdated or outmoded or
[5195.94 --> 5196.92]  wrong for today's
[5196.92 --> 5198.56]  world, that prophet is a
[5198.56 --> 5200.28]  liar and should not be
[5200.28 --> 5200.80]  listened to.
[5202.48 --> 5203.92]  Your word, Lord, is
[5203.92 --> 5204.30]  eternal.
[5204.58 --> 5205.96]  It stands firm in the
[5205.96 --> 5206.28]  heavens.
[5206.74 --> 5207.92]  The grass withers and
[5207.92 --> 5209.02]  the flowers fall, but the
[5209.02 --> 5210.52]  word of our God endures
[5210.52 --> 5211.00]  forever.
[5211.84 --> 5213.22]  I, the Lord, do not
[5213.22 --> 5213.78]  change.
[5214.34 --> 5215.06]  Heaven and earth will
[5215.06 --> 5216.34]  pass away, but my
[5216.34 --> 5218.42]  words will never pass
[5218.42 --> 5219.16]  away.
[5222.88 --> 5224.10]  But for the prophet who
[5224.10 --> 5225.62]  speaks words of life to
[5225.62 --> 5227.96]  you, hang on to them.
[5229.32 --> 5231.10]  Hang on to that word as
[5231.10 --> 5233.02]  it's God speaking directly
[5233.02 --> 5234.74]  to your heart and to your
[5234.74 --> 5235.22]  imagination.
[5236.16 --> 5238.46]  Know the word, study the
[5238.46 --> 5240.04]  word so that you can test
[5240.04 --> 5241.58]  the word that you hear.
[5241.58 --> 5243.88]  And then in that you
[5243.88 --> 5247.08]  will find more of God.
[5247.16 --> 5248.16]  You will find yourself
[5248.16 --> 5251.26]  deeper in Christ Jesus.
[5252.68 --> 5255.98]  And lastly, reject every
[5255.98 --> 5257.40]  kind of evil.
[5258.62 --> 5259.96]  Now this is probably the
[5259.96 --> 5261.26]  easiest one to understand,
[5262.08 --> 5263.22]  but the hardest one to do.
[5266.58 --> 5269.12]  Sin is crouching at your
[5269.12 --> 5270.62]  door and desires to have
[5270.62 --> 5270.82]  you.
[5272.02 --> 5273.52]  The evil that we contend
[5273.52 --> 5274.74]  with in our life is not
[5274.74 --> 5276.86]  so much out there as it
[5276.86 --> 5277.42]  is in here.
[5278.64 --> 5279.68]  As it's in here.
[5280.64 --> 5281.00]  Right?
[5281.06 --> 5281.90]  In our own hearts and
[5281.90 --> 5283.06]  minds and imaginations.
[5285.70 --> 5286.78]  But hear this.
[5288.64 --> 5291.18]  Jesus Christ has come into
[5291.18 --> 5291.68]  the world.
[5292.52 --> 5294.30]  And he has lived the life I
[5294.30 --> 5294.86]  should have lived.
[5295.74 --> 5297.84]  He has perfectly kept all
[5297.84 --> 5299.24]  the commands of the law in
[5299.24 --> 5299.86]  my place.
[5300.18 --> 5302.06]  And by his grace he has
[5302.06 --> 5303.48]  handed over his
[5303.48 --> 5305.40]  perfection to you.
[5306.58 --> 5308.58]  You just by faith must
[5308.58 --> 5309.16]  receive it.
[5310.30 --> 5312.24]  By faith must believe that
[5312.24 --> 5314.38]  Jesus Christ is the son of
[5314.38 --> 5314.76]  God.
[5314.88 --> 5316.12]  That he is the Lord.
[5316.24 --> 5318.24]  That he was raised from the
[5318.24 --> 5318.58]  dead.
[5319.26 --> 5321.14]  Because Jesus lived the life I
[5321.14 --> 5322.02]  should have lived and he
[5322.02 --> 5323.46]  died the death that I
[5323.46 --> 5323.86]  deserved.
[5324.02 --> 5326.76]  You now are set free from
[5326.76 --> 5328.10]  sin and death.
[5328.20 --> 5330.88]  You now are in Christ Jesus
[5330.88 --> 5332.86]  transformed into a new
[5332.86 --> 5333.42]  creation.
[5334.02 --> 5335.08]  Your heart of stone has
[5335.08 --> 5336.40]  become a heart of flesh that
[5336.40 --> 5338.08]  finally for the first time
[5338.08 --> 5340.60]  beats with the very love of
[5340.60 --> 5341.12]  God.
[5344.64 --> 5347.04]  Your heart of stone beats
[5347.04 --> 5349.66]  with the Holy Spirit.
[5349.66 --> 5355.62]  life lived in Christ Jesus is
[5355.62 --> 5358.90]  life drenched in the Holy
[5358.90 --> 5359.44]  Spirit.
[5361.92 --> 5363.08]  Wherever you're going this
[5363.08 --> 5366.68]  week I pray that part of it is
[5366.68 --> 5370.82]  deeper into the ocean of our
[5370.82 --> 5371.76]  relationship to God.
[5371.76 --> 5371.80]  God.
[5372.56 --> 5373.42]  Let's pray together.
[5383.48 --> 5384.28]  All right I'm going to do
[5384.28 --> 5385.48]  this as the worship team is
[5385.48 --> 5386.10]  making their way up.
[5388.68 --> 5391.48]  I want to invite the group from
[5391.48 --> 5392.80]  Adult and Teen Challenge to
[5392.80 --> 5393.28]  come to the front.
[5394.88 --> 5395.76]  Take a spot here.
[5396.62 --> 5398.42]  Elders, deacons, church members
[5398.42 --> 5399.30]  I'm going to invite you to come
[5399.30 --> 5400.08]  to the front as well.
[5400.08 --> 5401.76]  So we're going to lay our
[5401.76 --> 5402.32]  hands on them.
[5403.16 --> 5404.04]  We're going to pray for them.
[5405.10 --> 5406.88]  Not only as you have been for
[5406.88 --> 5408.74]  us an example of diving deep
[5408.74 --> 5410.40]  into the ocean of God's love
[5410.40 --> 5412.34]  of transformation but that that
[5412.34 --> 5413.04]  may continue.
[5413.92 --> 5414.90]  And that your story of
[5414.90 --> 5416.98]  transformation here might fuel
[5416.98 --> 5419.10]  transformation wherever you go.
[5420.52 --> 5421.58]  And so whether you come up to
[5421.58 --> 5422.58]  the front or not I'm going to
[5422.58 --> 5424.22]  invite you to hold your hand
[5424.22 --> 5424.36]  out.
[5424.44 --> 5426.42]  Let's stand as we pray this
[5426.42 --> 5427.92]  prayer together.
[5427.92 --> 5430.54]  Father, God is at work in our
[5430.54 --> 5433.36]  midst and so we pray for his
[5433.36 --> 5434.08]  work to continue.
[5434.68 --> 5435.16]  Let's pray.
[5438.84 --> 5442.52]  Holy, amazing, almighty God.
[5443.72 --> 5445.72]  We are basking in the glory of
[5445.72 --> 5447.00]  your presence this morning.
[5448.60 --> 5450.84]  Your spirit is here and alive
[5450.84 --> 5451.60]  among us.
[5451.60 --> 5453.76]  You are at work in the world
[5453.76 --> 5456.14]  and there is so many a story
[5456.14 --> 5457.68]  and testimony in front of us
[5457.68 --> 5460.32]  today bearing to that witness.
[5460.96 --> 5462.32]  Witnessing the truth of the
[5462.32 --> 5464.24]  gospel, the power of the
[5464.24 --> 5464.54]  gospel.
[5464.68 --> 5466.04]  And so, Lord God, today we
[5466.04 --> 5468.46]  declare, I am not ashamed of the
[5468.46 --> 5470.14]  gospel for it is the power of God
[5470.14 --> 5470.94]  unto salvation.
[5471.34 --> 5474.08]  We thank you for this salvation on
[5474.08 --> 5476.20]  display among us today.
[5476.20 --> 5479.06]  And we pray, Lord God, as you
[5479.06 --> 5482.62]  draw us deeper, that you would
[5482.62 --> 5486.42]  fan into a blazing fire our
[5486.42 --> 5487.72]  faith and the work of the
[5487.72 --> 5489.06]  spirit among us so that we might
[5489.06 --> 5491.28]  go from this place transformed
[5491.28 --> 5492.56]  and transforming.
[5493.32 --> 5494.84]  That we might go from this place
[5494.84 --> 5496.92]  renewed and renewing.
[5497.60 --> 5498.92]  And that we might go from this
[5498.92 --> 5501.64]  place rejoicing always.
[5501.64 --> 5506.36]  that your name might be on our
[5506.36 --> 5506.64]  lips.
[5507.18 --> 5509.96]  That your praises might draw us
[5509.96 --> 5512.74]  into the dark places of this
[5512.74 --> 5514.48]  world so that we might bring the
[5514.48 --> 5516.08]  light of the gospel.
[5517.58 --> 5518.82]  And so the stories that you have
[5518.82 --> 5520.40]  begun and are beginning here today,
[5520.54 --> 5522.58]  I pray, Lord God, see them through
[5522.58 --> 5523.86]  unto completion.
[5525.56 --> 5528.54]  That we might, Lord Jesus, with fear
[5528.54 --> 5531.18]  and trembling, work out the gift of
[5531.18 --> 5533.28]  salvation that you have given today.
[5533.80 --> 5535.06]  In Jesus' name we pray.
[5535.68 --> 5536.00]  Amen.
[5536.88 --> 5537.18]  Amen.
[5537.18 --> 5537.36]  Amen.
[5561.18 --> 5567.18]  Amen.
[5567.18 --> 5568.18]  Amen.
[5568.18 --> 5569.18]  Amen.
[5569.18 --> 5570.18]  Amen.
[5570.18 --> 5573.18]  Lord, I come to you.
[5573.72 --> 5578.80]  Let my heart be changed, renewed,
[5580.40 --> 5589.94]  flowing from the grace that I found in you.
[5589.94 --> 5605.94]  Lord, I come to know, weaknesses I see in me.
[5605.94 --> 5614.94]  Will we swift away by power of your love?
[5614.94 --> 5623.94]  Let me move from the grace that I found in you.
[5623.94 --> 5624.68]  Hold me close.
[5624.68 --> 5631.44]  Let your love surround me.
[5631.44 --> 5637.04]  Bring me here.
[5637.04 --> 5644.04]  Draw me to your side
[5644.04 --> 5649.04]  And as I wait
[5649.04 --> 5655.04]  I'll rise up like the eagle
[5655.04 --> 5658.04]  And the light will soar with you
[5658.04 --> 5661.04]  Your spirit leads me on
[5661.04 --> 5667.04]  In the power of your love
[5671.04 --> 5674.04]  Lord unveil my eyes
[5674.04 --> 5678.04]  Let me see your face
[5678.04 --> 5684.04]  To face the knowledge of your love
[5684.04 --> 5690.04]  As you live in me
[5691.04 --> 5699.04]  Lord renew my mind
[5699.04 --> 5703.04]  As your will unfolds
[5703.04 --> 5705.04]  In my life
[5705.04 --> 5711.04]  In living everyday
[5711.04 --> 5717.04]  The power of your love
[5717.04 --> 5723.04]  Hold me close
[5723.04 --> 5729.04]  Let your love surround me
[5729.04 --> 5735.04]  Bring me near
[5735.04 --> 5741.04]  Draw me to your side
[5741.04 --> 5747.04]  And as I wait
[5747.04 --> 5753.04]  I'll rise up like the eagle
[5753.04 --> 5757.04]  And I will soar with you
[5757.04 --> 5759.04]  Your spirit leads me on
[5759.04 --> 5761.04]  That leads me on
[5761.04 --> 5765.04]  The power of your love
[5765.04 --> 5771.04]  Hold me close
[5771.04 --> 5773.04]  Let your love surround me
[5773.04 --> 5777.04]  Let your love surround me
[5777.04 --> 5779.04]  Bring me near
[5779.04 --> 5783.04]  Bring me near
[5783.04 --> 5785.04]  Bring me near
[5785.04 --> 5787.04]  Draw me to your side
[5787.04 --> 5789.04]  Bring me near
[5789.04 --> 5791.04]  Draw me to your side
[5791.04 --> 5793.04]  And as I wait
[5793.04 --> 5797.04]  And as I wait
[5797.04 --> 5803.04]  I'll rise up like the eagle
[5803.04 --> 5805.04]  And as I wait
[5805.04 --> 5807.04]  And as I wait
[5807.04 --> 5808.04]  I will soar with you
[5808.04 --> 5809.04]  Your spirit leads me on
[5809.04 --> 5813.04]  In the power of your love
[5813.04 --> 5818.04]  And as I wait
[5818.04 --> 5819.04]  And as I wait
[5819.04 --> 5821.04]  And as I wait
[5821.04 --> 5823.04]  For your love
[5823.04 --> 5826.08]  In the power of your love.
[5837.60 --> 5849.88]  As you go, go with the blessing, go with the commissioning of God for the journey of life and faith lived in Christ Jesus ahead.
[5849.88 --> 5854.40]  God, go before you to lead you.
[5855.28 --> 5857.54]  God, go behind you to protect you.
[5858.32 --> 5860.66]  God, go beneath you to support you.
[5861.00 --> 5863.68]  And God, go beside you to befriend you.
[5864.26 --> 5865.98]  Do not be afraid.
[5866.52 --> 5868.40]  Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[5868.50 --> 5874.70]  Do not be afraid, but go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
[5875.32 --> 5876.00]  Amen.
