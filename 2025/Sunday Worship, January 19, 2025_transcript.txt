[470.00 --> 499.98]  Thank you.
[500.00 --> 529.98]  Thank you.
[530.00 --> 558.00]  Thank you.
[558.76 --> 570.10]  Heavenly Father, here we are gathered before you, each of us with different things on our hearts that we come and lay before you, Lord.
[570.10 --> 576.80]  Lord, we've gathered and we've been singing your praises.
[576.80 --> 581.60]  And sometimes sitting in silence can be really uncomfortable.
[581.60 --> 589.58]  Sometimes we gather and we sing and we worship you and then we go back to our own spaces of life.
[589.58 --> 594.12]  And we lose sight of you, God.
[619.58 --> 622.38]  And walk with you wherever we go, Lord.
[622.38 --> 627.98]  Lord, help us to remember your goodness.
[627.98 --> 630.18]  Help us to turn your eyes to you, Lord.
[630.18 --> 641.38]  And help us to look to our neighbors, our brothers and sisters in Christ, and turn their eyes to you and speak of you into their life, Lord.
[641.38 --> 656.22]  Lord, when there's differences in the nitty-gritty of the details, Lord, we get lost.
[656.22 --> 658.22]  We lose sight of you, Lord, we lose sight of you, Lord.
[658.22 --> 662.16]  We lose sight of you so often in everything we do, even in our praises, Lord.
[662.16 --> 674.38]  Sometimes we sing these songs and we forget that we're praising the God of the universe, the God who created us, who gave us life.
[676.14 --> 678.34]  Lord, help us turn our eyes to you.
[678.48 --> 680.58]  Help us turn our eyes to Jesus.
[682.70 --> 689.14]  And help us to turn each other's eyes to you, Lord, and speak of your love.
[690.38 --> 691.72]  In your name we pray.
[692.22 --> 692.56]  Amen.
[693.18 --> 693.68]  Amen.
[700.00 --> 702.86]  Amen.
[711.22 --> 718.84]  Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[720.10 --> 721.94]  Look full in voice.
[721.94 --> 726.00]  In His wonderful face.
[727.58 --> 733.90]  And the things of earth will grow strangely.
[735.12 --> 741.06]  In the light of His glory and grace.
[741.06 --> 755.12]  Turn your eyes to the hillside.
[755.12 --> 762.12]  Where justice and mercy embrace.
[763.04 --> 770.12]  Hither Son of God gave His life for us.
[771.06 --> 776.74]  And our measureless debt was a great.
[779.38 --> 786.24]  Jesus, to You we lift our eyes.
[786.84 --> 793.24]  Jesus, our glory and our prize.
[794.18 --> 798.24]  We adore You, behold You.
[798.24 --> 801.58]  Our Savior ever true.
[802.20 --> 807.24]  Oh Jesus, we turn our eyes to You.
[807.24 --> 820.38]  Turn your eyes to the morning.
[820.38 --> 826.38]  Then see Christ the Lion away.
[828.38 --> 832.30]  What a glorious dawn.
[832.38 --> 836.28]  Fear of death is gone.
[836.80 --> 842.04]  For we carry His life in our veins.
[842.04 --> 851.04]  Jesus, to You we lift our eyes.
[851.04 --> 858.04]  Jesus, our glory and our prize.
[858.04 --> 862.80]  We adore You, behold You.

[871.92 --> 883.92]  Turn your eyes to the heavens.
[883.92 --> 890.92]  Our King will return for His own.
[890.92 --> 891.92]  Every knee will bow.
[891.92 --> 895.92]  Every knee will bow.
[895.92 --> 899.92]  Every tongue will shout.
[899.92 --> 905.92]  All glory to Jesus the Lord.
[905.92 --> 912.92]  Jesus, to You we lift our eyes.
[912.92 --> 919.92]  Jesus, our glory and our prize.
[919.92 --> 920.92]  We adore You, behold You.
[920.92 --> 921.92]  We adore You, behold You.
[921.92 --> 922.92]  Our Savior ever true.

[939.92 --> 944.92]  Oh Jesus, to You we lift our eyes.
[944.92 --> 951.92]  Oh Jesus, our glory and our prize.
[951.92 --> 955.92]  We adore You, behold You.
[955.92 --> 958.92]  Our Savior ever true.
[958.92 --> 968.92]  Oh Jesus, we turn our eyes to You.
[968.92 --> 973.92]  Oh Jesus, we turn our eyes to You.
[981.92 --> 982.92]  Please stand.

[1177.38 --> 1186.36]  I'm walking in freedom for God so loved, God so loved the world.

[1227.88 --> 1239.66]  Good morning, my name is...
[1239.66 --> 1240.38]  Wow.
[1241.06 --> 1243.16]  Good morning, my name is Mike.
[1243.30 --> 1247.54]  I am a deacon here at the church and we are going to take some time in our service to worship
[1247.54 --> 1249.70]  God by giving back some of our financial gifts.
[1250.30 --> 1253.90]  So, we are giving to the ministry missions of this church, of course.
[1253.90 --> 1258.20]  So, if you want to give to that, make sure it's designated, whether it's an e-transfer
[1258.20 --> 1260.70]  or in the bags that we'll pass around in a minute.
[1261.20 --> 1263.60]  But our special offering today is for NAME.
[1264.32 --> 1268.28]  That is the North American Indigenous Ministries that our church supports.
[1268.42 --> 1273.02]  And there is the Johnson family, which is a missionary family that works with indigenous peoples
[1273.02 --> 1275.62]  that this church is supporting directly.
[1275.88 --> 1278.76]  So, thank you very much for giving of your gifts this morning.
[1278.76 --> 1278.82]  Thank you.
[1278.82 --> 1278.86]  Thank you.
[1283.90 --> 1313.88]  Thank you.

[1360.54 --> 1361.64]  Yes, sir.
[1361.64 --> 1364.98]  Yes, sir.
[1365.12 --> 1373.56]  No, as you said that.
[1373.56 --> 1383.06]  God's love so sure shall still endure, all measureless and strong.
[1383.46 --> 1391.86]  Redeeming grace to Adam's race, to saints and angels' song.
[1391.86 --> 1409.92]  O love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong, it shall forevermore endure, the saints and angels' song.
[1409.92 --> 1420.64]  Could we rethink the ocean fill, and were the skies of parchment made,
[1420.98 --> 1429.62]  were every stalk on earth a quill, and every man ascribed by trade,
[1429.62 --> 1438.40]  to write the love of God above, would drain the ocean dry,
[1438.40 --> 1447.16]  nor could the scroll contain the whole, the stretch from sky to sky.
[1447.56 --> 1455.84]  O love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong,
[1456.26 --> 1464.68]  it shall forevermore endure, the saints and angels' song.
[1464.68 --> 1473.84]  O love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong,
[1473.84 --> 1483.60]  it shall forevermore endure, the saints and angels' song.
[1483.60 --> 1494.76]  O love of God, how rich and pure, how rich and pure, how rich and pure, how rich and pure.
[1494.76 --> 1498.62]  Okay, I'd like to call the kids up front for the children's worship time.
[1498.62 --> 1514.88]  I'm going to say good morning to you, but I want you guys to respond in a different way.
[1514.96 --> 1518.02]  I want you to say good morning with a long morning.
[1518.40 --> 1519.00]  Can you do that?
[1519.78 --> 1520.64]  Good morning.
[1521.14 --> 1522.62]  Good morning.
[1523.74 --> 1524.36]  I love it.
[1524.38 --> 1524.84]  I love it.
[1524.86 --> 1525.28]  All right.

[1526.74 --> 1528.98]  Have you guys seen me in a while?
[1529.04 --> 1530.22]  I haven't been up here in a long time.
[1530.28 --> 1531.38]  Does anybody recognize me?
[1531.42 --> 1532.16]  Do you know who I am?
[1532.44 --> 1532.68]  Yeah?
[1533.04 --> 1534.78]  I've been on a little bit of a sabbatical.
[1534.92 --> 1535.82]  Do you know what that word is?
[1536.40 --> 1537.78]  I'm taking a little bit of a break.
[1538.70 --> 1540.56]  But I was asked to help out this morning.
[1540.66 --> 1541.48]  So I'm just checking.
[1541.58 --> 1543.14]  I haven't been up here in like six months.
[1543.24 --> 1547.34]  I'm wondering if you guys, does anybody know, does anybody here know what my name is?
[1547.94 --> 1549.30]  Who knows what my name is?
[1550.10 --> 1550.46]  Anybody?

[1563.64 --> 1563.90]  Okay.
[1563.96 --> 1565.56]  I got another question for you.
[1568.12 --> 1570.22]  Does anybody know if I'm married or not?
[1571.04 --> 1571.52]  Okay.

[1586.18 --> 1586.78]  Forty.
[1586.86 --> 1587.28]  I like it.
[1587.34 --> 1589.26]  Well, I'm actually a little bit older than that, but that's close.
[1589.32 --> 1589.82]  We'll take that.
[1589.88 --> 1590.44]  That's all good.
[1591.02 --> 1593.50]  The gray hair hasn't deceived you guys yet.
[1593.58 --> 1593.84]  Okay.
[1594.74 --> 1595.70]  Another question for you.
[1595.76 --> 1597.06]  Do you want to see me walking around?
[1597.14 --> 1598.52]  Am I tall or am I short?
[1602.18 --> 1603.22]  I heard that.
[1604.14 --> 1604.46]  Medium.
[1604.70 --> 1605.30]  Good answer.
[1605.30 --> 1606.30]  Good answer.
[1606.30 --> 1607.98]  So, you guys know a few things about me.
[1608.04 --> 1611.00]  I got something new I want to tell you about me that you don't know.
[1611.64 --> 1614.56]  At my house, we had...
[1614.56 --> 1616.30]  This shirt's kind of old, but...
[1617.58 --> 1620.90]  At my house, we have a cat that lives outside.
[1621.00 --> 1622.96]  It's not an inside cat, but it had kittens.
[1622.96 --> 1627.22]  And I didn't really think I liked cats or kittens, but you know what?
[1627.72 --> 1629.02]  The kittens are kind of cute.
[1629.10 --> 1631.04]  Does anybody here have a cat or a pet at home?
[1631.32 --> 1631.60]  Yeah?
[1632.56 --> 1633.82]  Well, guess what?
[1633.86 --> 1639.48]  I got two extra kittens at home, so if anybody wants a kitten, come talk to me after church.
[1639.48 --> 1644.24]  Now, back to children's worship time.
[1646.68 --> 1651.38]  I just shared a whole bunch of things about you that you know about me, but today, we're
[1651.38 --> 1654.54]  going to go into children's worship time, and we're working on a series right now about
[1654.54 --> 1655.94]  who Jesus is.
[1656.96 --> 1660.56]  And I just shared a bunch of things about you that you know about Jesus, and in the
[1660.56 --> 1663.92]  back, we're going to learn a little bit more about how to share the things that we
[1663.92 --> 1665.56]  know about Jesus with other people.
[1666.40 --> 1667.26]  You think we can do that?
[1667.26 --> 1667.66]  Yeah.
[1667.66 --> 1670.50]  What are some places where we learn about Jesus?
[1670.62 --> 1671.66]  Where have you learned about Jesus?
[1671.80 --> 1672.40]  Give me an idea.
[1672.72 --> 1673.56]  From school.
[1673.98 --> 1674.84]  From church.
[1675.46 --> 1676.30]  Sunday school.
[1676.90 --> 1679.68]  Your parents, maybe, and reading the Bible, stuff like that.
[1680.86 --> 1681.30]  Right?
[1682.30 --> 1682.98]  Right on.
[1684.12 --> 1689.00]  Okay, we are going to give the blessing, so if everybody can please rise, and we'll share
[1689.00 --> 1691.08]  the blessing with everybody before we run out of here.
[1692.52 --> 1692.96]  Ready?
[1692.96 --> 1693.02]  Ready?
[1694.36 --> 1696.62]  The Lord be with you.
[1696.62 --> 1698.54]  And also with you.
[1698.54 --> 1699.70]  Good morning.
[1699.70 --> 1720.40]  My name is Seth, and I promise not to try to sell you any kittens or pets.
[1720.40 --> 1727.54]  Instead, it would be my, it is my pleasure to lead you in our congregational prayer.
[1728.00 --> 1729.20]  So if you could please bow your heads.
[1729.44 --> 1729.78]  Let's pray.
[1732.66 --> 1737.46]  Heavenly Father, we come before you today with hearts full of gratitude, knowing you are a
[1737.46 --> 1739.30]  God who listens and responds.
[1739.30 --> 1743.50]  As the psalmist said, give ear to my words, O Lord.
[1744.02 --> 1745.06]  Consider my sighing.
[1745.72 --> 1748.54]  Listen to my cry for help, my King and my God.
[1748.90 --> 1750.22]  For to you I pray.
[1751.56 --> 1756.48]  We thank you for your nearness and faithfulness, and we bring our prayers before you, trusting
[1756.48 --> 1757.32]  that you hear us.
[1757.32 --> 1764.16]  In the morning we lay our requests before you, waiting expectantly for your guidance and provision.
[1765.36 --> 1770.80]  We acknowledge that you are holy and just, and we seek to walk in your light, turning
[1770.80 --> 1771.60]  away from sin.
[1772.48 --> 1776.00]  Help us, Father, to live lives that reflect your goodness and righteousness.
[1776.00 --> 1782.92]  We pray for our church family, for Pastor Chris and all our leaders, that they may serve with
[1782.92 --> 1783.98]  wisdom and compassion.
[1785.08 --> 1787.66]  Strengthen them as they lead us to follow you more faithfully.
[1788.72 --> 1794.26]  We also pray for each member of this congregation, those who are struggling with illness, grief,
[1794.54 --> 1795.34]  or anxiety.
[1796.48 --> 1801.64]  May your peace, healing, and comfort be with them, and may we as a community support one
[1801.64 --> 1802.44]  another in love.
[1802.44 --> 1807.56]  And may we also celebrate when there is joy and healing that comes to us.
[1809.18 --> 1814.00]  Lord, we lift up our families, our children, youth, and marriages.
[1815.12 --> 1820.08]  Protect and guide our young ones, and strengthen the bonds of love between husbands and wives.
[1820.98 --> 1826.48]  We pray that our homes may be places of peace, joy, and faith, reflecting your love.
[1828.06 --> 1831.66]  We ask for your provision for those in need in our community and beyond.
[1832.44 --> 1837.78]  May your church be a light in this community and in this world, offering hope and help
[1837.78 --> 1838.32]  to the hurting.
[1839.34 --> 1843.68]  We also pray for the global church, especially those suffering for their faith.
[1844.68 --> 1849.30]  May they find strength in your presence, and may your message of hope reach every corner
[1849.30 --> 1849.80]  of the earth.
[1849.80 --> 1855.14]  Finally, Lord, we return to the words of the psalmist.
[1855.14 --> 1858.72]  But I, by your great love, can come into your house.
[1859.36 --> 1861.84]  In reverence, I bow down toward your holy temple.
[1862.84 --> 1866.34]  We are grateful that by your love, we can approach you freely.
[1867.14 --> 1871.94]  Help us to honor you with our lives, living with gratitude for the sacrifice of Jesus,
[1872.48 --> 1874.44]  who made a way for us to be with you.
[1874.44 --> 1879.26]  We offer all of these prayers in the name of Jesus Christ, our Savior.
[1879.86 --> 1880.14]  Amen.
[1880.14 --> 1880.26]  Amen.
[1880.26 --> 1905.94]  As you can tell by the picture behind me, we are currently in a series in the books
[1905.94 --> 1907.34]  of Thessalonians.
[1907.90 --> 1913.08]  We're continuing this week in our deep dive in the beginning of chapter 2.
[1913.80 --> 1919.16]  And so in just a moment, I'm going to read from 1 Thessalonians 2, verses 1 through 12.
[1919.78 --> 1922.34]  First time through, of course, they're going to be on the screen behind me.
[1922.76 --> 1927.82]  But I encourage you, as you are able to have a Bible, either in your hands or on your device,
[1927.82 --> 1936.90]  and turn that to the passage and keep that open as we will be referring regularly back to this text together.
[1938.68 --> 1948.26]  In this series, we have been challenged by the Apostle Paul to fix our eyes on the future
[1948.26 --> 1958.52]  and imminent return of Jesus Christ as an encouragement for how we live our lives of faith in the world today, right now.
[1959.32 --> 1966.56]  So we open our eyes to the truth of Christ's future return so that in this present moment,
[1966.88 --> 1969.94]  we can be sustained and encouraged.
[1969.94 --> 1979.12]  And we're going to continue seeing how Paul leads us and invites us into this perspective on life here and now.
[1979.50 --> 1982.60]  And so I encourage you to read along with me.
[1983.40 --> 1986.34]  We're going to read starting in chapter 2.
[1990.22 --> 1991.54]  Hear the word of the Lord.
[1992.00 --> 1997.68]  You know, brothers and sisters, that our visit to you was not without results.
[1997.68 --> 2004.40]  We had previously suffered and been treated outrageously in Philippi, as you know,
[2004.86 --> 2011.04]  but with the help of our God, we dared to tell you his gospel in the face of strong opposition.
[2012.36 --> 2018.86]  For the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives, nor are we trying to trick you.
[2018.86 --> 2024.98]  On the contrary, we speak as those approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel.
[2024.98 --> 2029.98]  We're not trying to please people, but God who tests our hearts.
[2030.94 --> 2036.00]  You know, we never used flattery, nor did we put on a mask to cover up greed.
[2036.44 --> 2037.84]  God is our witness.
[2038.56 --> 2042.88]  We were not looking for praise from people, not from you or anyone else,
[2042.96 --> 2047.04]  even though as apostles of Christ, we could have asserted our authority.
[2047.68 --> 2052.60]  Instead, we were like children, young children among you.
[2052.60 --> 2059.32]  Just as a nursing mother cares for her children, so we cared for you.
[2060.58 --> 2066.64]  Because we loved you so much, we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God,
[2066.74 --> 2068.40]  but our lives as well.
[2069.74 --> 2073.26]  Surely you remember, brothers and sisters, our toil and hardship.
[2073.92 --> 2080.30]  We worked night and day in order to not be a burden to anyone while we preached the gospel of God to you.
[2080.30 --> 2089.22]  You are witnesses, and so is God, of how holy, righteous, and blameless we were among you who believed.
[2090.36 --> 2096.38]  For you know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own children,
[2097.24 --> 2103.18]  encouraging, comforting, and urging you to live lives worthy of God,
[2103.50 --> 2107.36]  who calls you into his kingdom and glory.
[2107.36 --> 2109.26]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2117.76 --> 2122.10]  How do you know your faith is real?
[2124.26 --> 2128.14]  How do you know the Christian faith is real?
[2128.14 --> 2132.96]  Let's get a little more existential.
[2133.58 --> 2136.72]  How do we know any of this is real?
[2139.72 --> 2142.86]  As we dig into the word to us this morning,
[2142.86 --> 2152.10]  what I hope you will see clearly and plainly is that authentic faith shows up in conversion,
[2153.30 --> 2156.20]  in conviction, and courage.
[2156.20 --> 2160.80]  Conversion, conviction, and courage.
[2162.60 --> 2163.92]  Now let's set the stage again.
[2164.66 --> 2171.18]  While Paul and his missionary companions, Silas and Timothy, were in Thessalonica,
[2172.34 --> 2177.90]  it was their practice to go to the Jewish synagogue to preach and to teach.
[2177.90 --> 2181.60]  And for three weeks, they did this.
[2181.60 --> 2187.48]  They would work and they would meet with people, maybe operating out of the house of Jason,
[2188.20 --> 2191.38]  and then they would go to the synagogue on the Sabbath and they would teach.
[2192.34 --> 2198.52]  And as a result of this work and pattern, some of the Jews and a large number of Greek men and women,
[2198.52 --> 2202.48]  even ones of status, we're told, became Christian.
[2202.60 --> 2203.94]  They became believers.
[2205.40 --> 2209.94]  Acts 17, where this story is told, actually tells us that because of that,
[2210.30 --> 2213.16]  some of the other Jewish leaders were jealous.
[2213.84 --> 2218.40]  And so what they did is round up some bad characters.
[2218.76 --> 2220.10]  That's how Luke describes them.
[2220.10 --> 2222.48]  And they started a riot in the city.
[2223.78 --> 2229.94]  The mob gathered up early believers, Jason and a few others, but not Paul or Silas and Timothy,
[2230.46 --> 2232.64]  and brought them to the city officials.
[2233.50 --> 2238.10]  And they were charged with insurrection and treason against Caesar
[2238.10 --> 2243.32]  because they called Jesus the only true king.
[2243.32 --> 2251.84]  And the crowd and the city officials then are thrown into turmoil and an uproar,
[2252.16 --> 2257.00]  and Jason and the others have to pay a fine, and then they're let go.
[2258.42 --> 2266.14]  Now, when night fell, we read that Paul and Silas and Timothy are secreted away out to Berea,
[2266.28 --> 2269.86]  which is the next town over to the west of Thessalonica.
[2269.86 --> 2278.26]  And so, using our imaginations, it's not hard to imagine what the people,
[2278.82 --> 2283.78]  the opposition groups left in Thessalonica are now saying about Paul.
[2285.38 --> 2289.94]  In fact, when Silas and Timothy join up with Paul later in Corinth,
[2290.44 --> 2294.72]  they would tell him that you won't believe what they're saying in Thessalonica.
[2295.50 --> 2298.00]  They're saying you ran away because you were scared.
[2298.00 --> 2304.02]  They're saying that your work there was pointless because nothing has changed for them.
[2305.34 --> 2310.50]  Now, to be clear, right, these are the opponents of Paul who are saying these things,
[2310.58 --> 2314.84]  who are trying to sway those early Christians back from their beliefs.
[2315.54 --> 2318.26]  But as we've seen, right, they're not swayed.
[2318.58 --> 2320.36]  That's why Paul is so encouraged.
[2320.64 --> 2323.82]  That's why he's so excited about the church in Thessalonica.
[2323.82 --> 2326.74]  What did we read in verse 1?
[2327.54 --> 2332.84]  You know, brothers and sisters, that our visit to you was not without results.
[2333.74 --> 2335.74]  Our work was not in vain.
[2335.94 --> 2337.38]  Lives were changed.
[2338.66 --> 2339.44]  He goes on, he says,
[2339.52 --> 2344.16]  We suffered and we were treated outrageously in Philippi.
[2344.26 --> 2345.32]  You know that too.
[2345.32 --> 2354.12]  Quickly, Philippi is the city that Paul and Silas and Timothy were in before going to Thessalonica.
[2354.78 --> 2360.68]  And while they were there, they were arrested because they cast out a demon from a girl.
[2360.84 --> 2364.52]  And that demon was using the girl to predict the future.
[2364.72 --> 2370.88]  And so the merchants who owned this slave girl were really upset and charged Paul and Silas,
[2370.98 --> 2372.12]  brought them before the courts.
[2372.12 --> 2376.84]  They were stripped and they were beaten with rods and they were severely flogged.
[2376.98 --> 2381.98]  And they were thrown into prison and they were locked up in the stockades in prison in Philippi.
[2382.16 --> 2383.86]  And do you know what they did when they were in prison?
[2386.26 --> 2387.66]  They sang hymns.
[2388.26 --> 2390.72]  They sang hymns and they prayed to God.
[2392.80 --> 2396.28]  That's what they did in prison after being flogged and beaten.
[2396.28 --> 2398.62]  And so here in our text, Paul is saying,
[2398.76 --> 2399.84]  You know I'm not a coward.
[2400.62 --> 2402.68]  You know that I don't run away from pain.
[2403.20 --> 2405.92]  In fact, I sing in the face of pain.
[2407.70 --> 2410.12]  The opponents of Paul are saying things like,
[2410.46 --> 2411.20]  He tricked you.
[2411.30 --> 2412.64]  He's a lying swindler.
[2412.92 --> 2414.62]  He's a snake oil salesman.
[2414.70 --> 2415.62]  He's a charlatan.
[2415.70 --> 2417.68]  He just wanted to cheat you out of your money.
[2420.30 --> 2422.70]  You ever heard pastors or churches described that way?
[2422.70 --> 2425.84]  Paul says,
[2426.76 --> 2431.24]  Remember, remember, we never used flattery.
[2431.52 --> 2432.82]  We didn't put a mask on.
[2433.60 --> 2435.38]  We didn't lie or speak error.
[2435.74 --> 2436.86]  Our motives were pure.
[2437.04 --> 2438.98]  Instead, God is our witness.
[2439.48 --> 2440.50]  He tests our hearts.
[2440.64 --> 2442.64]  He approves the message we speak,
[2442.72 --> 2446.54]  the gospel that you have received and believed in and been transformed by.
[2446.54 --> 2447.04]  Right?
[2447.86 --> 2451.58]  Paul is able to cite the content of his message
[2451.58 --> 2457.18]  and the content of his life to prove his authenticity.
[2460.46 --> 2466.00]  Paul's concern, then, here, is for the truth.
[2467.94 --> 2468.04]  Right?
[2468.14 --> 2470.60]  And God's word is truth.
[2470.60 --> 2487.10]  Now, there's a pattern here that I want us to identify and to look at for a moment.
[2487.10 --> 2496.38]  Conversion by the gospel yields a conviction for the gospel,
[2497.06 --> 2501.38]  which together then yield a courage with the gospel.
[2502.90 --> 2503.30]  Okay?
[2503.44 --> 2506.40]  Follow the adverbs there.
[2506.58 --> 2507.76]  Follow those words.
[2507.88 --> 2511.18]  Conversion by the gospel brings a conviction for the gospel,
[2511.18 --> 2515.98]  which shows up in your life by courage with the gospel.
[2517.10 --> 2518.68]  Or, to put it another way,
[2519.18 --> 2523.18]  transformation based on truth brings testimony.
[2524.70 --> 2527.22]  Transformation, truth, testimony.
[2529.52 --> 2530.46]  Here's the principle.
[2530.60 --> 2531.28]  Zoom out from that.
[2531.38 --> 2531.44]  Right?
[2531.50 --> 2534.30]  Because this is the disciples' journey.
[2535.52 --> 2536.02]  Right?
[2536.08 --> 2537.46]  This is what happened to Paul.
[2537.66 --> 2538.74]  This is what happened to Timothy.
[2538.74 --> 2541.80]  This is what happened and was happening for the church at Thessalonica.
[2542.22 --> 2544.80]  And this is our journey as disciples.
[2545.54 --> 2545.66]  Right?
[2545.66 --> 2547.88]  21 centuries later.
[2548.04 --> 2549.16]  This is my journey.
[2549.32 --> 2550.32]  This is your journey.
[2550.44 --> 2552.90]  This is the journey for all of us who believe.
[2553.12 --> 2557.18]  Genuine belief brings authentic transformation.
[2557.86 --> 2559.18]  It's really real.
[2559.28 --> 2560.10]  There's no masks.
[2560.26 --> 2561.24]  There's no self-deception.
[2561.66 --> 2563.44]  There's no deceiving others.
[2563.88 --> 2568.10]  Genuine belief equals authentic transformation.
[2568.10 --> 2575.34]  And that authentic transformation has to work its way out of you.
[2575.34 --> 2578.62]  It happens inside and it works out.
[2579.88 --> 2580.52]  Right?
[2580.56 --> 2585.38]  That conversion is worked by genuine conviction for the gospel.
[2585.38 --> 2592.50]  Scripture and doctrine growing in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[2592.62 --> 2601.50]  Submitting yourself and your life, your opinions, taking all your thoughts captive to Christ and to His Word.
[2602.68 --> 2602.88]  Right?
[2602.88 --> 2606.06]  With Peter, we say, where else can we go, Lord?
[2606.06 --> 2608.66]  You have the words of eternal life.
[2611.24 --> 2617.10]  Conversion by the Word builds a conviction for the Word.
[2617.10 --> 2629.10]  And when you see what the Word can do in your life and in the lives of other believers, there's a courage, right, that compels you to share it, to declare it, to proclaim it.
[2630.90 --> 2635.10]  Mark begins his gospel saying, this is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[2635.10 --> 2639.36]  This is the gospel of God, the power of God unto salvation.
[2639.80 --> 2641.72]  And so, I will not be ashamed.
[2642.94 --> 2644.46]  Or with Paul in Romans, right?
[2644.50 --> 2646.64]  How can they believe unless they hear?
[2646.90 --> 2649.34]  How can they hear unless it is preached to them?
[2649.48 --> 2651.76]  And how can they preach unless someone is sent?
[2653.52 --> 2659.16]  Transformation is your born-again life by grace through faith.
[2659.32 --> 2663.30]  This is the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[2665.10 --> 2678.66]  And now, put plainly, put simply, the gospel is the truth that Jesus lived the life I should have lived and died the death that I deserved.
[2680.40 --> 2685.68]  Put it another way, the gospel is the truth that Jesus entered into the world.
[2686.48 --> 2692.60]  He entered into your world and He took on Himself all my sin and all my shame.
[2692.60 --> 2694.44]  He took on Himself all my guilt.
[2694.44 --> 2702.82]  He took on Himself all your anxiety, all your worries, all your fears, everything that is bad and broken in your life.
[2702.98 --> 2704.60]  He put it on His own shoulders.
[2705.46 --> 2708.06]  And He bore that all the way onto the cross.
[2709.04 --> 2710.02]  Into death.
[2711.36 --> 2719.62]  And then, in taking that from you, He looked at you and He put on your shoulders His righteousness.
[2719.62 --> 2724.20]  By grace, you are clothed with Him.
[2724.20 --> 2726.72]  His holiness is on your shoulders.
[2726.86 --> 2728.60]  You now wear Christ.
[2728.74 --> 2730.78]  This is the gospel that transforms.
[2732.30 --> 2735.44]  And we know that this mission was successful.
[2735.44 --> 2740.48]  That this act was really real because of the resurrection of God.
[2740.48 --> 2742.06]  The tomb is empty.
[2742.92 --> 2748.08]  And therefore, death and sin and guilt and wrath are defeated and ended.
[2748.22 --> 2749.86]  The wrath of God is satisfied.
[2749.86 --> 2754.54]  The kingdom of darkness no longer has a claim on those who believe.
[2754.94 --> 2760.86]  But you, rather, are God's children, holy and dearly loved.
[2760.86 --> 2768.50]  This is your transformation set apart for God's purposes.
[2769.96 --> 2774.38]  And it comes by the truth of the gospel.
[2775.62 --> 2782.64]  And when that truth works its way out, it's revealed in your life as your testimony.
[2782.64 --> 2788.96]  Your life lived courageous with the gospel.
[2790.48 --> 2792.02]  Here's the thing, right?
[2793.24 --> 2794.64]  One who has ears, let him hear.
[2795.46 --> 2797.40]  We've been building here.
[2798.80 --> 2801.38]  Transformation, truth, testimony.
[2802.08 --> 2804.48]  Transformation, truth, testimony.
[2804.48 --> 2818.02]  If you are not living the courage of your faith in that testimony area, you've got to come back one more to the truth.
[2818.94 --> 2825.98]  If you are not living that compelling testimony, standing up for the faith, guarding the good deposit that was entrusted for you,
[2825.98 --> 2832.26]  right, you've got to come back to the word, to the truth, to the doctrines of your faith, to the words of eternal life,
[2832.28 --> 2838.12]  where God speaks to his church, where you hear the voice of Jesus say to you,
[2838.58 --> 2844.04]  come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
[2845.26 --> 2851.82]  If you are timid with your faith, open the word of God and ask him to show you himself.
[2851.82 --> 2857.90]  Ask him to show you why these are living words, powerful words.
[2858.34 --> 2863.92]  Pray that the Holy Spirit opens the eyes of your heart to see Jesus and to hear him say,
[2864.34 --> 2867.02]  go into all the world and declare my name.
[2867.28 --> 2871.58]  Ask the Holy Spirit to unstop your ears so that you can hear Jesus say,
[2872.00 --> 2875.90]  in this world you will have trouble, but take heart.
[2876.80 --> 2878.30]  I have overcome the world.
[2881.82 --> 2897.06]  If you are not living the courage of your faith, you need to come back to the conviction of the gospel.
[2901.10 --> 2909.32]  Maybe, maybe you're here this morning, and courage in the gospel isn't where you're trying to be yet.
[2909.32 --> 2912.94]  Maybe you're one step further away yet.
[2913.20 --> 2916.14]  Maybe your struggle is actually trusting in the truth.
[2916.48 --> 2919.08]  Maybe you haven't yet been converted to the gospel.
[2919.24 --> 2921.74]  Maybe you're holding back Holy Spirit transformation.
[2922.26 --> 2926.80]  Maybe you have wondered about the cost of this thing, and you're like,
[2926.88 --> 2928.52]  eh, not sure that's for me.
[2928.82 --> 2935.76]  Maybe you're not convinced that taking up your cross and following Jesus is what you really want.
[2935.76 --> 2942.12]  Or, more likely for most of us here this morning,
[2943.12 --> 2948.02]  maybe you're not convinced that you actually want to give up everything.
[2950.58 --> 2955.22]  Maybe you're content with the current content of your life.
[2956.28 --> 2956.78]  Right?
[2956.82 --> 2957.38]  You're pretty okay.
[2958.64 --> 2959.78]  You're not so bad.
[2959.78 --> 2964.86]  Instead, you don't hurt people, at least on purpose, and definitely not often.
[2966.12 --> 2966.60]  Right?
[2966.62 --> 2968.46]  You don't need to change everything, right?
[2969.44 --> 2971.50]  Besides changing everything, that's way too much work.
[2974.78 --> 2981.00]  And, what's more, I actually can't imagine my life without that thing.
[2981.00 --> 2987.70]  I can't imagine what life would be like without that crutch, or without that drink, or without that drug.
[2987.98 --> 2988.12]  Right?
[2988.14 --> 2993.42]  I've done this for so long, I don't know what I would be apart from that thing.
[2994.50 --> 2997.96]  Apart from that personality or that plan.
[2999.90 --> 3001.06]  Here's the thing, right?
[3001.16 --> 3006.38]  Again, if you're tracking with me, and I pray that you are, because I think this is so amazing.
[3006.38 --> 3007.14]  Right?
[3007.40 --> 3013.80]  If that's where you're at, if you are holding something back from transformation by the Holy Spirit,
[3014.42 --> 3016.82]  you also need more of the truth.
[3017.36 --> 3018.34]  You need more of the Word.
[3018.66 --> 3024.04]  You also need to come to the Word of God, to, yes, this book right here,
[3024.24 --> 3029.74]  so that your very imaginations can be shaped by the voice of Jesus.
[3029.74 --> 3035.90]  So that what you imagine possible can be transformed by the reality of who God is.
[3037.38 --> 3037.90]  Right?
[3037.96 --> 3041.70]  If you've ever thought, it's no big deal, or I could never change that.
[3041.86 --> 3046.02]  If you've ever thought, I could keep that part to myself, ideally.
[3046.38 --> 3046.56]  Right?
[3046.60 --> 3049.08]  Or if you've ever thought, I'm always going to be stuck here.
[3049.38 --> 3049.52]  Right?
[3049.64 --> 3054.28]  What we need is for your imagination to be transformed by the Gospel.
[3054.56 --> 3056.94]  You need to believe what's really possible.
[3056.94 --> 3062.24]  You need to hear from God's Word that nothing is impossible with God.
[3062.24 --> 3066.80]  You need to hear that the Word of God is alive and active.
[3066.92 --> 3069.00]  It is sharper than any double-edged sword.
[3069.38 --> 3072.18]  It penetrates even dividing soul and spirit.
[3072.52 --> 3074.98]  You need to hear that Jesus prayed for you.
[3074.98 --> 3078.76]  Jesus Himself in the garden prayed for you, and He said,
[3079.20 --> 3081.08]  Sanctify them by your truth.
[3081.48 --> 3083.88]  Your Word is truth.
[3085.40 --> 3085.56]  Right?
[3085.62 --> 3093.16]  Sometimes, faith is just an imagination profoundly convicted by the Word of God.
[3093.16 --> 3109.24]  In the transformed life of faith is one that lives in submission to the Word of God
[3109.24 --> 3113.04]  and is sustained by the Word of God.
[3113.76 --> 3114.06]  Right?
[3114.06 --> 3119.44]  The Word of God is both the rule and the means by which we are spurred to keep the rule.
[3119.44 --> 3126.68]  And all of this is what Paul wants the church in Thessalonica to remember.
[3127.28 --> 3127.58]  Right?
[3127.62 --> 3131.22]  In short, he says to them, and you can look at this with me, right?
[3131.48 --> 3132.02]  He says,
[3132.12 --> 3133.22]  We spoke the truth.
[3133.84 --> 3134.54]  That's verse 3.
[3134.90 --> 3135.00]  Right?
[3135.00 --> 3141.16]  For the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives, nor are we trying to trick you.
[3141.60 --> 3144.68]  We spoke the truth, and we spoke it plainly.
[3145.06 --> 3145.68]  Verse 5.
[3145.68 --> 3146.58]  He says,
[3146.68 --> 3152.12]  You know, we never used flattery, nor did we put on a mask to cover up greed.
[3152.22 --> 3156.84]  We spoke the truth, we spoke it plainly, and we spoke with humility.
[3157.60 --> 3158.06]  Verse 6.
[3159.18 --> 3163.52]  We were not looking for praise from people.
[3164.50 --> 3168.68]  Even though as apostles of Christ, we could have asserted our authority.
[3168.68 --> 3179.12]  We spoke the truth, spoke it plainly, spoke it with humility, concerned only to please God.
[3180.16 --> 3185.14]  We speak as those approved by God, not trying to please people, but God.
[3185.28 --> 3188.12]  God is our witness.
[3188.12 --> 3204.16]  And here, here we are, we talked about speaking the gospel courageously.
[3204.84 --> 3204.98]  Right?
[3205.06 --> 3209.12]  Living and speaking the testimony of our truth.
[3209.90 --> 3211.58]  And this is what that looks like.
[3212.42 --> 3212.90]  Right?
[3213.00 --> 3213.78]  Speak the truth.
[3214.84 --> 3215.82]  Speak it plainly.
[3215.82 --> 3217.60]  Speak with humility.
[3218.60 --> 3219.52]  And then don't worry about them.
[3220.22 --> 3221.86]  Don't worry about what they might say.
[3221.94 --> 3224.02]  Instead, set your heart on Him.
[3224.80 --> 3226.58]  Set your heart on Him who gives you the words.
[3227.76 --> 3231.54]  Set your heart on Him who has given you this gospel.
[3231.68 --> 3234.92]  Set your heart on Him who has transformed you by it.
[3237.60 --> 3242.22]  Finally, one last thing from this text.
[3242.22 --> 3253.24]  Paul is here speaking about the transformation that comes from the truth that is lived as a testimony to the gospel.
[3253.50 --> 3253.60]  Right?
[3253.72 --> 3255.52]  Conversion, conviction, courage.
[3255.92 --> 3260.20]  And to be sure, this is a personal reality.
[3260.44 --> 3268.12]  This is ultimately about you and your restoration to relationship to God through Jesus Christ.
[3268.12 --> 3272.62]  This is about your conversion, your conviction, and your courage.
[3273.34 --> 3282.66]  But notice, all of that happens in the broader context of broader relationships.
[3283.40 --> 3284.08]  Right?
[3284.18 --> 3288.96]  Conversion and conviction and courage in the context of the church.
[3289.60 --> 3292.44]  At the body of Christ, the family of God.
[3292.44 --> 3296.28]  So here, I've added a line to our big idea.
[3296.70 --> 3296.78]  Right?
[3296.90 --> 3304.78]  Authentic faith shows up in conversion, conviction, and courage in the context of the church.
[3306.46 --> 3308.82]  Paul illustrates this for us with some word pictures.
[3309.72 --> 3312.04]  First, he says in verse 7,
[3312.44 --> 3315.80]  Instead, we were like young children among you.
[3316.26 --> 3318.74]  That is, we lived with you.
[3319.22 --> 3320.88]  We didn't try to be out on our own.
[3320.88 --> 3321.20]  Right?
[3321.20 --> 3321.80]  Right?
[3321.86 --> 3326.18]  We were part of the new family that is being built in Thessalonica.
[3327.08 --> 3328.08]  And then he goes on.
[3328.14 --> 3328.38]  He says,
[3328.72 --> 3330.32]  We were like a nursing mother.
[3331.46 --> 3335.16]  Now, some of you will get this more clearly than others.
[3336.82 --> 3344.56]  But of course, nursing mothers give their whole lives to their infant child.
[3344.56 --> 3353.88]  Night and day, while dad is snoring away, mom gives herself for the baby.
[3354.78 --> 3360.78]  The child, in that moment, quite literally, is receiving their life from mom.
[3362.68 --> 3367.66]  And Paul says that we worked hard not to be a burden, but to ease the burden.
[3368.46 --> 3369.42]  That's a mother.
[3369.42 --> 3369.90]  Right?
[3369.90 --> 3370.50]  Right?
[3370.50 --> 3373.94]  Everything a mother does is for her baby.
[3375.54 --> 3380.76]  And that's a model for us in our shared lives of faith.
[3381.58 --> 3384.24]  This is a beautiful image that Paul is using here.
[3384.60 --> 3390.66]  Leaders, those who are mature in faith, are like nursing mothers to the next generation of believers.
[3391.38 --> 3394.22]  This is the covenant picture of the church family.
[3394.22 --> 3399.66]  You might be 60 years old and all your kids grown and moved out of the house.
[3399.82 --> 3405.92]  But your responsibility is to be a nursing mother to the next generation of faith.
[3408.16 --> 3409.64]  And then he continues, right?
[3409.70 --> 3416.64]  He continues and builds on this image that Paul says that in the context of the church,
[3416.86 --> 3423.18]  in the context of the church, our relationship to God is worked out in the midst of our relationship to each other
[3423.18 --> 3425.54]  as spiritual fathers.
[3426.20 --> 3426.30]  Right?
[3426.38 --> 3432.00]  Fathers encourage and comfort and urge you to live lives worthy of God.
[3433.08 --> 3433.38]  Right?
[3433.46 --> 3438.84]  Urge you to become the men and the women that you were born by grace through faith to be.
[3439.86 --> 3444.70]  And so you might be 30 years old, having barely figured out where your life is going
[3444.70 --> 3446.72]  and what it's going to look like for the next 10 years,
[3446.86 --> 3452.14]  but you are responsible to be a spiritual father to the next generation of those in faith.
[3453.18 --> 3460.34]  Look, I really believe that there is something happening in the world right now.
[3461.62 --> 3465.86]  Now, I don't want to use the language of revival because by definition,
[3466.12 --> 3470.08]  that language can only be applied after the fact when you're looking back on history.
[3470.64 --> 3475.08]  But there does seem to be an openness to faith right now.
[3475.08 --> 3482.16]  There does seem to be a new curiosity for things spiritual and things historic.
[3483.48 --> 3488.36]  Young people especially are asking questions of faith and life.
[3489.40 --> 3492.84]  And whether you call it a meaning crisis or a spiritual void,
[3493.14 --> 3497.22]  the reality of today's world is that the harvest is plentiful,
[3497.54 --> 3498.76]  the fields are ripe,
[3498.76 --> 3502.38]  and who is going to go and proclaim the gospel to them.
[3503.98 --> 3505.70]  When your faith is real,
[3505.96 --> 3508.72]  when you've experienced that transformation by the truth,
[3508.94 --> 3511.60]  you long to live as a testimony of Christ.
[3511.96 --> 3513.76]  So then go, speak the truth,
[3514.12 --> 3515.12]  speak it plainly,
[3515.40 --> 3516.66]  speak it with humility,
[3517.88 --> 3518.86]  concerned only
[3518.86 --> 3521.06]  with what God
[3521.06 --> 3523.06]  thinks of you.
[3523.06 --> 3529.18]  This is what Paul describes as a life lived,
[3529.42 --> 3530.50]  worthy of God,
[3530.70 --> 3535.58]  who calls you into His kingdom and His glory.
[3536.26 --> 3537.48]  If your Bibles are open,
[3538.40 --> 3539.68]  look at that in verse 12.
[3540.44 --> 3540.74]  It says,
[3541.06 --> 3542.30]  live lives worthy of God,
[3542.36 --> 3544.96]  who calls you into His kingdom and His glory.
[3544.96 --> 3546.00]  That word glory
[3546.00 --> 3550.30]  shows up in our text in verse 6
[3550.30 --> 3551.92]  as well.
[3551.92 --> 3553.10]  In verse 6,
[3553.26 --> 3554.26]  we already read it,
[3554.50 --> 3555.24]  but you missed it,
[3555.50 --> 3558.62]  we're not looking for praise from people.
[3559.16 --> 3559.88]  That word praise
[3559.88 --> 3561.94]  is the same word for glory.
[3562.88 --> 3563.84]  Doxen in Greek.
[3565.44 --> 3567.36]  Paul wasn't seeking glory
[3567.36 --> 3569.20]  from the people of Thessalonica,
[3569.44 --> 3570.96]  from the people that he was preaching to,
[3571.04 --> 3573.54]  because he already had glory
[3573.54 --> 3575.10]  in God His Father.
[3575.20 --> 3577.56]  He already had glory visible
[3577.56 --> 3579.10]  in the face of Jesus.
[3579.10 --> 3581.78]  He had a true and better glory
[3581.78 --> 3582.56]  that he knew
[3582.56 --> 3584.24]  and that he clinged to.
[3584.56 --> 3585.66]  The glory of God
[3585.66 --> 3586.38]  is held
[3586.38 --> 3587.32]  and beheld
[3587.32 --> 3588.78]  in the face of Jesus.
[3588.96 --> 3589.46]  In Him,
[3589.56 --> 3591.32]  the fullness of the deity dwells.
[3591.64 --> 3592.46]  Beholding Him,
[3592.54 --> 3593.26]  we are transformed
[3593.26 --> 3594.28]  from one degree
[3594.28 --> 3595.16]  of glory
[3595.16 --> 3595.98]  to another.
[3596.08 --> 3597.04]  Or as Paul says
[3597.04 --> 3597.78]  elsewhere,
[3597.94 --> 3598.30]  he says,
[3598.44 --> 3598.76]  therefore,
[3599.06 --> 3600.64]  we do not lose heart.
[3601.48 --> 3602.92]  Live lives worthy of the calling,
[3603.00 --> 3603.16]  right?
[3603.22 --> 3603.80]  With courage.
[3604.16 --> 3605.80]  We do not lose heart.
[3605.80 --> 3608.44]  Though outwardly we are wasting away,
[3608.58 --> 3610.90]  yet inwardly we are being renewed
[3610.90 --> 3612.28]  day by day.
[3612.38 --> 3613.16]  For our light
[3613.16 --> 3614.72]  and momentary troubles
[3614.72 --> 3616.32]  are achieving for us
[3616.32 --> 3618.06]  an eternal glory
[3618.06 --> 3620.00]  that far outweighs them all.
[3620.32 --> 3621.22]  And so what do we do?
[3621.48 --> 3622.64]  What does a life lived
[3622.64 --> 3624.04]  worthy of the calling look like?
[3624.10 --> 3625.84]  We fix our eyes on
[3625.84 --> 3627.34]  not what is seen,
[3627.46 --> 3629.30]  but on what is unseen.
[3630.02 --> 3631.76]  Since what is seen is temporary,
[3632.02 --> 3632.84]  but what is unseen
[3632.84 --> 3634.88]  is eternal.
[3634.88 --> 3636.64]  This is what it looks like
[3636.64 --> 3637.94]  to live lives
[3637.94 --> 3639.02]  worthy of God.
[3639.48 --> 3640.24]  Transformation,
[3640.80 --> 3641.20]  truth,
[3641.58 --> 3642.28]  and testimony.
[3642.86 --> 3643.80]  Children of faith
[3643.80 --> 3645.46]  encouraged and surrounded
[3645.46 --> 3646.56]  by spiritual mothers
[3646.56 --> 3647.48]  and fathers
[3647.48 --> 3648.82]  and all of us together
[3648.82 --> 3650.24]  fixing our eyes
[3650.24 --> 3651.66]  on the glory
[3651.66 --> 3653.12]  of Christ.
[3654.78 --> 3655.18]  And so,
[3656.12 --> 3659.24]  as you go into this week,
[3660.38 --> 3664.18]  as you go into this week,
[3664.18 --> 3666.52]  I wonder if you would be bold enough
[3666.52 --> 3669.64]  to pray this prayer with me.
[3670.82 --> 3673.44]  I wonder if you would be courageous enough
[3673.44 --> 3674.90]  to take this prayer
[3674.90 --> 3677.28]  into your Monday
[3677.28 --> 3678.42]  and Tuesday,
[3679.06 --> 3679.42]  Wednesday,
[3680.02 --> 3680.42]  Thursday,
[3680.96 --> 3681.26]  Friday,
[3681.50 --> 3682.30]  and Saturday.
[3683.74 --> 3685.52]  Would you pray this prayer with me?
[3685.52 --> 3687.36]  Lord Jesus,
[3688.06 --> 3689.20]  reveal to me
[3689.20 --> 3690.52]  the next generation
[3690.52 --> 3692.70]  of those who will believe.
[3693.60 --> 3695.24]  Send me to them
[3695.24 --> 3697.24]  that I may declare the gospel.
[3697.78 --> 3698.72]  Send me out
[3698.72 --> 3700.96]  that I may speak the truth,
[3701.26 --> 3702.68]  may speak it plainly,
[3702.80 --> 3704.38]  and may speak it with humility
[3704.38 --> 3709.20]  concerned only with your glory.
[3709.20 --> 3712.98]  Would you pray this with me?
[3714.04 --> 3714.78]  And who knows?
[3715.44 --> 3716.26]  Who knows?
[3717.22 --> 3718.38]  Maybe we will look back
[3718.38 --> 3719.12]  on this moment
[3719.12 --> 3720.84]  and see revival
[3720.84 --> 3722.14]  in this land.
[3722.80 --> 3723.02]  Amen?
[3724.02 --> 3725.10]  Oh, come on, guys.
[3726.30 --> 3726.82]  Amen?
[3732.36 --> 3733.42]  Let's pray this prayer.
[3733.42 --> 3738.86]  Lord Jesus,
[3739.86 --> 3741.62]  reveal to me
[3741.62 --> 3742.42]  the next generation
[3742.96 --> 3745.52]  of those who will believe.
[3747.78 --> 3749.46]  Send me to them
[3749.46 --> 3751.54]  that I may declare the gospel.
[3753.04 --> 3753.80]  Send me out
[3753.80 --> 3755.26]  that I may speak the truth,
[3755.96 --> 3757.54]  that I may speak it plainly,
[3757.70 --> 3759.28]  that I may speak it with humility
[3759.28 --> 3763.30]  concerned only with your glory.
[3763.42 --> 3769.94]  May this be our prayer.
[3771.28 --> 3772.14]  Lord Jesus,
[3772.28 --> 3773.08]  we pray this
[3773.08 --> 3776.26]  in your powerful name.
[3777.10 --> 3779.12]  The name by which lives
[3779.12 --> 3780.38]  are transformed.
[3781.40 --> 3783.74]  The truth of who you are.
[3785.18 --> 3786.10]  And the testimony
[3786.10 --> 3788.24]  that you are calling us to live.
[3789.16 --> 3790.20]  In Jesus we pray.
[3791.04 --> 3791.40]  Amen.
[3793.42 --> 3795.24]  Amen.
[3795.24 --> 3812.66]  With faith we see the hand of God
[3812.66 --> 3818.86]  In the light of creation's grand design.
[3820.02 --> 3827.00]  In the lives of those who prove his faithfulness.
[3827.00 --> 3832.72]  Who walk by faith and not by sight.
[3836.82 --> 3842.10]  By faith our fathers roam the earth.
[3842.66 --> 3849.38]  With the power of his promise in their hearts.
[3849.38 --> 3856.72]  Of a holy city built by God's own hand.
[3857.10 --> 3861.22]  A place where peace and justice reign.
[3862.74 --> 3867.86]  We will stand as children of the promise.
[3867.86 --> 3874.86]  We will fix our eyes on him our souls reward.
[3875.92 --> 3881.86]  Till the race is finished and the work is done.
[3883.64 --> 3887.86]  We'll walk by faith and not by sight.
[3887.86 --> 3894.86]  We'll walk by faith and not by sight.
[3894.86 --> 3896.86]  And by faith the prophets all day.
[3898.44 --> 3903.58]  With a longed for Messiah would appear.
[3905.26 --> 3910.86]  With the power to break the chains of sin and death.
[3912.86 --> 3916.86]  And rise triumphant from the grave.
[3916.86 --> 3926.52]  My faith the church was called to go
[3926.52 --> 3933.96]  In the power of the Spirit to the lost
[3933.96 --> 3941.08]  To deliver captives and to preach good news
[3941.08 --> 3946.00]  In every corner of the earth
[3946.00 --> 3952.50]  We will stand as children of the promise
[3952.50 --> 3959.10]  We will fix our eyes on Him on souls reward
[3959.10 --> 3966.52]  Till the race is finished and the work is done
[3966.52 --> 3971.54]  We'll walk by faith and not by sight
[3976.00 --> 3981.50]  By faith the mountains shall be moved
[3981.50 --> 3987.00]  And the power of the gospel shall prevail
[3987.00 --> 3994.50]  For we know in Christ all things are possible
[3994.50 --> 4000.00]  For the who call upon His name
[4000.00 --> 4006.50]  We will stand as children of the promise
[4006.50 --> 4013.40]  We will fix our eyes on Him on souls reward
[4013.40 --> 4020.00]  Till the race is finished and the work is done
[4020.00 --> 4026.50]  We'll walk by faith and not by sight
[4026.50 --> 4033.00]  We will stand as children of the promise
[4033.00 --> 4039.00]  We will fix our eyes on Him on souls reward
[4039.00 --> 4046.50]  Till the race is finished and the work is done
[4046.50 --> 4051.00]  We will walk by faith and not by sight
[4051.00 --> 4069.50]  As we are sent out to live our faith courageously
[4069.50 --> 4073.90]  I want to end this service with a blessing from God's word
[4073.90 --> 4079.00]  Actually the way that Paul ends his letter to the church in Thessalonica
[4079.00 --> 4082.76]  Before we go, just a quick reminder
[4082.76 --> 4085.54]  That if you're going to stick around for the new members class
[4085.54 --> 4088.94]  That's going to take place about 20 or 25 minutes
[4088.94 --> 4091.22]  After the final song
[4091.22 --> 4092.68]  And so you'll have time to grab a coffee
[4092.68 --> 4094.12]  And hang out together
[4094.12 --> 4095.74]  And then we'll meet in the multi-purpose room
[4095.74 --> 4098.96]  Additionally, if you would like to meet with someone for prayer
[4098.96 --> 4100.94]  There will be someone here up at the front
[4100.94 --> 4102.94]  Probably with the yellow name tag on
[4102.94 --> 4104.90]  Who'd love to meet you and pray with you
[4104.90 --> 4109.06]  Go now this week with the blessing of God
[4109.06 --> 4114.22]  May God Himself, the God of peace
[4114.22 --> 4117.68]  Sanctify you through and through
[4117.68 --> 4121.86]  And may your whole spirit, soul, and body
[4121.86 --> 4126.50]  Be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[4126.50 --> 4129.00]  The one who calls you is faithful
[4129.00 --> 4132.20]  And He will do it
[4132.20 --> 4133.48]  Amen
[4147.68 --> 4160.50]  O church, arise and put your armor on
[4160.50 --> 4163.96]  Hear the call of Christ our captain
[4163.96 --> 4170.00]  For now the weak can say that they are strong
[4170.00 --> 4173.28]  In the strength that God has given
[4173.28 --> 4178.60]  With shield of faith and belt of truth
[4178.60 --> 4183.46]  We'll stand against the devil's light
[4183.46 --> 4188.90]  An army bull whose battle cries love
[4188.90 --> 4192.28]  Wishing out to those in darkness
[4192.28 --> 4193.10]  Amen
[4193.10 --> 4202.32]  A call to war
[4202.32 --> 4205.32]  To love the captive soul
[4205.32 --> 4208.60]  But to rage against the captor
[4208.60 --> 4211.72]  And with the sword
[4211.72 --> 4214.66]  That makes the wounded whole
[4214.66 --> 4218.84]  We will fight with faith and valor
[4218.84 --> 4223.48]  With faith that drowns on every side
[4223.48 --> 4227.66]  We know the outcome is secure
[4227.66 --> 4227.94]  We know the outcome is secure
[4227.94 --> 4229.80]  With Christ the land
[4229.80 --> 4233.52]  The prize for which He died
[4233.52 --> 4237.80]  The inheritance of nations
[4237.80 --> 4243.12]  Arise, shine for the risen Son
[4243.12 --> 4244.12]  For the risen Son
[4244.12 --> 4258.12]  Lift your eyes
[4258.12 --> 4265.12]  We are His radiant pride
[4265.12 --> 4270.44]  Arise, arise, arise
[4270.44 --> 4275.44]  Arise, arise
[4275.44 --> 4280.08]  See the cross where love and mercy meet
[4280.08 --> 4283.44]  As the Son of God is stricken
[4283.44 --> 4289.66]  Then see His foes like crushed beneath His feet
[4289.66 --> 4293.06]  For the conqueror has risen
[4293.06 --> 4298.38]  And as the stone is rolled away
[4298.38 --> 4303.06]  And Christ emerges from the grave
[4303.06 --> 4308.38]  The victory march continues till the day
[4308.38 --> 4312.38]  Every eye and heart shall see Him
[4312.38 --> 4317.00]  So Spirit come
[4317.00 --> 4320.18]  Put strength in every strife
[4320.18 --> 4323.44]  Give grace for every hurdle
[4323.44 --> 4326.36]  And we may run
[4326.36 --> 4329.54]  With faith to win the prize
[4329.54 --> 4332.84]  Of a servant good and faithful
[4332.84 --> 4338.02]  As saints of old still lie the way
[4338.02 --> 4342.58]  We challenge triumphs of His grace
[4342.58 --> 4344.18]  We hear their calls
[4344.18 --> 4351.40]  Fall and hunger for the day when Christ will stand in glory.
[4353.64 --> 4361.20]  Arise, shine, for your light has come.
[4361.20 --> 4370.14]  Arise, shine, for the risen Son.
[4370.14 --> 4379.24]  Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bright.
[4379.98 --> 4385.36]  Arise, O Church, arise.
[4385.36 --> 4397.24]  Arise, shine, for your light has come.
[4397.24 --> 4405.80]  Arise, shine, for the risen Son.
[4406.34 --> 4415.04]  Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bright.
[4415.04 --> 4421.28]  Arise, O Church, arise.
[4427.24 --> 4433.50]  Arise, O Church, arise.
[4433.50 --> 4436.34]  Arise, O Church, arise.
[4436.34 --> 4440.30]  Arise, O Church, arise.
[4440.30 --> 4470.28]  Thank you.
[4470.30 --> 4500.28]  Thank you.
[4500.30 --> 4530.28]  Thank you.
[4530.30 --> 4546.30]  Thank you.
[4560.30 --> 4590.28]  Thank you.
[4590.30 --> 4620.28]  Thank you.
[4620.30 --> 4650.28]  Thank you.
[4650.30 --> 4680.28]  Thank you.
[4680.30 --> 4710.28]  Thank you.
