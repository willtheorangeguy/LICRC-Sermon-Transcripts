[0.00 → 1.00] Amen.
[30.00 → 32.00] Amen.
[60.00 → 62.00] Amen.
[90.00 → 92.00] Amen.
[120.00 → 122.00] Amen.
[150.00 → 152.00] Amen.
[180.00 → 182.00] Amen.
[210.00 → 212.00] Amen.
[240.00 → 242.00] Amen.
[270.00 → 272.00] Amen.
[300.00 → 302.00] Amen.
[312.00 → 317.26] Happy New Year to you if I didn't catch you earlier and on the way in.
[317.40 → 321.84] Welcome to worship here at Langley Emanuel Church.
[321.84 → 326.48] If you are a guest with us or if you are forgetful, my name is Chris.
[326.48 → 335.14] I'm one of the pastors here at Emanuel, and it's my privilege to lead in our shared worship together this morning.
[335.14 → 339.76] Before we begin our worship, we have a couple community announcements to make.
[340.88 → 348.34] And so, first, after worship today, Youth Coffee is happening at the Hubert's House.
[348.52 → 353.32] And so if you're part of our youth program, or you're interested in being a part of our youth program,
[353.72 → 356.46] join them for Youth Coffee at the Hubert's House.
[356.52 → 360.74] If you have questions about that, Pastor Kevin will happily answer that.
[360.74 → 363.00] Or Hubert's, Jackie, wave.
[364.08 → 365.98] That, yeah, not that Hubert's.
[367.10 → 371.14] I was trying to figure out a way to differentiate which Hubert's it was.
[371.68 → 374.06] And then I thought, we'll go with the young Hubert's.
[374.74 → 377.48] So go to the youngish Hubert's House.
[378.40 → 380.70] Yeah, but don't show up at Noah's House. That's fair.
[380.70 → 384.44] If you have questions, talk to either one. They'll get you there.
[385.30 → 393.44] Next Sunday, we are having our HCBC and Heidelberg Catechism Reading Group.
[393.94 → 395.44] That's starting back up.
[395.80 → 401.66] But we're trying for the month of January to do that after morning service.
[401.66 → 404.00] And so there's going to be soup and buns.
[404.40 → 412.82] And we're going to hang out and do that after morning service, both for the youth HCBC and for the adult education group.
[413.26 → 417.82] So that will happen next Sunday after service with soup and buns.
[418.06 → 419.36] So mark your calendars.
[419.80 → 420.52] Be ready for that.
[420.52 → 430.96] And then many of you probably have already received the invitation to the small group leaders training night that we're running.
[431.00 → 439.18] But that's an invitation for all of us, even if you're not part of one of our official run small group or Bible study groups here.
[439.18 → 445.20] If you would like to join us for a small group training night, please just talk to me after the service.
[445.30 → 448.00] I'll take that down, or you can email me through the week.
[448.30 → 451.78] But that's going to happen on January 21st at 730.
[452.16 → 453.34] So you can mark your calendar for that.
[453.46 → 454.96] Love to see you out there.
[456.26 → 457.28] That's it for announcements.
[457.28 → 467.94] And so let's stand together as you are able and where you are, and we can be ushered into the presence of God, welcomed by him and receive his greeting.
[470.88 → 472.78] Receive the greeting of our God.
[474.12 → 484.90] Grace to you and peace from God, our father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, son and our saviour through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[486.06 → 486.46] Amen.
[487.28 → 490.88] I invite you to welcome those around you into worship as well this morning.
[492.10 → 492.50] Peace.
[492.50 → 492.54] Peace.
[492.54 → 492.58] Peace.
[492.58 → 492.62] Peace.
[492.62 → 492.66] Peace.
[492.66 → 492.68] Peace.
[492.68 → 492.72] Peace.
[492.72 → 492.78] Peace.
[492.78 → 493.72] Peace.
[493.72 → 502.30] Peace.
[506.88 → 509.14] Peace.
[512.98 → 513.04] Peace.
[513.18 → 513.58] Peace.
[513.58 → 516.02] Peace.
[516.02 → 517.96] Peace.
[517.96 → 526.32] Good morning.
[527.26 → 531.94] As we begin our worship service, our first worship service of this new year,
[532.38 → 536.22] our call to worship comes from Psalm 90, verses 1 and 2.
[537.22 → 543.76] I chose Psalm 90 because I was familiar with it as it was always read in its entirety
[543.76 → 550.48] by my grandfather on New Year's Day as we all got together as a family after church.
[551.40 → 552.88] This is our call to worship.
[554.00 → 556.86] The words of Psalm 90, verses 1 and 2.
[557.54 → 562.40] From everlasting to everlasting, a prayer of Moses, the man of God.
[562.98 → 566.52] Lord, you have been my dwelling place in all generations.
[567.02 → 569.04] Before the mountains were brought forth,
[569.04 → 572.28] wherever you had formed the earth and the world,
[572.48 → 576.24] from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.
[576.24 → 593.62] From everlasting to everlasting, you are God.
[593.62 → 607.44] From everlasting to everlasting, you are God.
[607.44 → 614.90] From holiness, you stand secure through culture, shift in sin.
[615.58 → 621.68] I'm changed by all the amenities of man.
[621.68 → 629.06] And as the nations rise and fall, your sovereignty remains.
[629.06 → 642.66] You are, you are, you are, you are the one true love.
[642.66 → 655.04] To everlasting, you are God.
[655.04 → 669.04] To everlasting, you are God.
[669.04 → 671.42] You are, you are, you are.
[671.42 → 676.22] Faithfulness, your love extends through times of turbulence.
[676.22 → 682.92] And God to those who call upon your name.
[682.92 → 690.80] And every generation joins in songs of grateful grace.
[690.80 → 704.38] You are, you are, you are the one to come.
[704.38 → 716.70] From everlasting, to everlasting, you are God.
[716.70 → 730.70] From everlasting, to everlasting, you are God.
[730.70 → 743.52] Eternal, before our Lord, invisible God.
[743.52 → 757.66] Eternal, before our Lord, invisible God.
[757.66 → 772.10] From everlasting, to everlasting, you are God.
[772.10 → 786.10] From everlasting, to everlasting, you are God.
[787.66 → 789.66] Amen.
[817.66 → 819.66] Amen.
[819.66 → 821.66] Amen.
[821.66 → 823.66] Amen.
[823.66 → 824.66] Amen.
[824.66 → 826.66] Amen.
[826.66 → 837.52] What heights of love, what depths of peace, when fears are still and striding cease.
[837.88 → 848.58] My comforter, my all in all, here in the love of Christ I stand.
[848.58 → 861.02] In Christ alone, who took on flesh, fullness of God in helpless day.
[861.02 → 871.32] There's gift of love and righteousness, stored by the ones he gave to save.
[871.32 → 881.60] Till on that cross as Jesus died, the wrath of God was satisfied.
[881.60 → 892.36] For every sin on him was laid, here in the death of Christ I live.
[892.36 → 904.36] Through him the ground his body lay, light of the world by darkness slain.
[904.36 → 914.36] Then bursting forth in glorious day, up from the grave he rose again.
[914.36 → 925.46] And as he stands in victory, sin's curse has lost its grip on me.
[925.80 → 936.36] For I am his, and he is mine, part of the precious blood of Christ.
[936.36 → 943.36] No will to life, no fear in death.
[944.36 → 948.36] This is the power of Christ in me.
[948.36 → 958.52] From life's first cry to final breath, Jesus commends my destiny.
[958.52 → 969.64] No power of hell, no scheme of man, can ever walk me from his hand.
[969.64 → 979.52] Till he returns or calls me home, here in the power of Christ I stand.
[979.52 → 1005.52] May we sing.
[1005.52 → 1013.52] Thank you.
[1013.52 → 1015.52] Please pray with me.
[1015.52 → 1022.52] Eternal, everlasting God, who can make all things new, we humbly come before you this
[1022.52 → 1025.52] first Sunday of a new year.
[1025.52 → 1030.52] Where life has been good to us this past year, we give you our thanks and praise.
[1030.52 → 1036.52] Where we have pleased you in our thoughts, words and deeds as your children, may our reward
[1036.52 → 1038.52] be your smiling face.
[1038.52 → 1044.52] Where we have sinned and fallen short of your good pleasure, we pray for your forgiveness
[1044.52 → 1048.52] and pray that you would free us from our sinful past.
[1048.52 → 1055.52] Lord, we take a few minutes now in time of personal confession and reflection.
[1055.52 → 1065.52] Lord, we take a few minutes.
[1065.52 → 1066.52] Thank you.
[1066.52 → 1068.52] Lord, we take a few minutes.
[1068.52 → 1070.52] Lord, we take a few minutes.
[1070.52 → 1073.52] Lord, we take a few minutes.
[1073.52 → 1079.98] Holy and merciful God,
[1080.46 → 1083.66] we pray, and we thank you that you cleanse us by your mercy,
[1084.58 → 1085.92] guide us in your truth,
[1086.44 → 1089.96] and you fill us with your love and lead us forward in this new year
[1089.96 → 1093.78] with hope and trust through the grace of Jesus Christ our Lord.
[1093.78 → 1094.66] Amen.
[1097.18 → 1100.04] Please stand again as we continue singing.
[1103.52 → 1105.52] Amen.
[1129.52 → 1132.16] I love you, Lord.
[1133.52 → 1137.52] For your mercy never fails me.
[1139.06 → 1144.52] All my days have been held in your hands.
[1145.72 → 1148.52] From the moment that I wake up,
[1149.40 → 1151.52] until I lay my head,
[1151.52 → 1157.52] I will sing of the goodness of God.
[1157.52 → 1165.52] All my life you have been faithful.
[1168.52 → 1174.52] All my life you have been so, so good.
[1174.52 → 1179.52] And every breath that I am able,
[1179.52 → 1185.52] I will sing of the goodness of God.
[1185.52 → 1189.52] I love your voice.
[1189.52 → 1194.52] You have led me through the fire,
[1194.52 → 1196.52] into our best life.
[1196.52 → 1201.52] You are close like no other.
[1201.52 → 1205.72] I've known you as a father
[1205.72 → 1209.92] I've known you as a friend
[1209.92 → 1214.66] I have lived with your goodness
[1214.66 → 1223.22] All my life you have been faithful
[1223.22 → 1231.50] All my life you have been so, so good
[1231.50 → 1237.16] With every breath that I am able
[1237.16 → 1243.86] I will sing in my goodness, O God
[1243.86 → 1249.42] Your goodness is running after
[1249.42 → 1252.28] It's running after me
[1252.28 → 1256.32] Your goodness is running after
[1256.32 → 1259.40] It's running after me
[1259.40 → 1263.28] My life laid down, surrender now
[1263.28 → 1266.06] To give you everything
[1266.06 → 1270.12] Your goodness is running after
[1270.12 → 1273.40] It's running after me
[1273.40 → 1277.12] Your goodness is running after
[1277.12 → 1280.06] It's running after me
[1280.06 → 1284.12] Your goodness is running after
[1284.12 → 1287.18] It's running after me
[1287.18 → 1290.96] My life laid down, surrender now
[1290.96 → 1293.62] To give you everything
[1293.62 → 1297.62] Your goodness is running after
[1297.62 → 1301.28] It's running after me
[1301.28 → 1307.94] All my life you have been faithful
[1307.94 → 1318.10] All my life you have been so, so good
[1318.10 → 1322.76] With every breath that I am able
[1322.76 → 1329.76] I will sing of the goodness, O God
[1329.76 → 1336.42] I will sing of the goodness, O God
[1336.42 → 1345.08] All my life you have been so, so good
[1345.08 → 1349.08] I will sing of the goodness, O God
[1349.08 → 1379.06] All my life you have been so, so good
[1379.08 → 1384.46] A peace like a river
[1384.46 → 1388.90] A peace like a river, a dead and death my way
[1388.90 → 1396.86] When sorrows like sea billows roll
[1396.86 → 1405.98] Whenever my heart, thou hast taught me to stay
[1405.98 → 1414.48] It is well, it is well with my soul
[1414.48 → 1423.92] It is well, it is well with my soul
[1423.92 → 1434.86] It is well, it is well with my soul
[1434.86 → 1442.24] Though Satan should buffet
[1442.24 → 1447.04] Though trials should come
[1447.04 → 1454.68] Let his blessed assurance control
[1454.68 → 1463.06] That Christ has regarded my health, my health, my health, my health, my health
[1463.06 → 1473.06] And hasten, and hasten, his own blood for my soul
[1473.06 → 1482.44] It is well, it is well with my soul
[1482.44 → 1493.44] It is well, it is well with my soul
[1493.44 → 1506.02] I sing, O the bliss of this glorious song
[1506.02 → 1506.06] My sin, O the bliss of this glorious song
[1506.06 → 1513.76] My sin, not in part, but the whole
[1513.76 → 1514.76] It is well with my soul
[1514.76 → 1519.14] It is well with my soul
[1519.14 → 1523.52] And I bear it no more
[1523.52 → 1529.14] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord
[1529.14 → 1533.14] Praise the Lord, O my soul
[1533.14 → 1540.14] It is well with my soul
[1540.14 → 1544.14] It is well with my soul
[1544.14 → 1554.14] It is well, it is well with my soul
[1554.14 → 1560.14] O Lord, haste the day
[1560.14 → 1565.94] When my faith shall be signed
[1565.94 → 1570.96] The clouds be rolled back
[1570.96 → 1573.14] As a scroll
[1573.14 → 1579.28] The trump shall resound
[1579.28 → 1584.52] And the Lord shall descend
[1584.52 → 1595.32] Even so, it is well with my soul
[1595.32 → 1596.52] Even so, it is well with my soul
[1596.52 → 1603.36] It is well, it is well with my soul
[1603.36 → 1615.56] With my soul, it is well, it is well with my soul.
[1633.36 → 1641.58] Good morning and happy new year to all of you.
[1642.14 → 1645.54] My name is Pearl. I'm a deacon here at Langley Emanuel.
[1646.46 → 1650.64] And it's time to continue our worship by giving of our offerings.
[1651.46 → 1660.14] And today's offerings are for the budget, brand-new budget of 2025, and also for life recovery.
[1660.14 → 1663.40] Life recovery stands for living in faith every day.
[1664.20 → 1670.12] And it is a Christian faith-based charity that is not-for-profit.
[1670.34 → 1676.58] And it is established to support women to overcome their addictions to substance abuse.
[1677.24 → 1683.92] So they have a mission to provide a safe home and structured programs in a Christian community
[1683.92 → 1691.06] so that women who desire can have a lifestyle change that's free from alcohol and drug abuse.
[1693.26 → 1694.88] In Hebrews we read,
[1695.44 → 1701.16] Do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.
[1701.16 → 1706.68] While we're giving of our offerings, today there will also be a slide presentation
[1706.68 → 1711.34] of the highlights of this church family from 2024.
[1711.84 → 1714.72] So do give generously even as God has been generous with you.
[1714.72 → 1744.70] Thank you.
[1744.72 → 1744.78] Thank you.
[1745.28 → 1756.48] Thank you.
[1756.86 → 1761.58] Thank you.
[1765.76 → 1769.04] Thank you.
[1769.04 → 1770.54] Thank you.
[1771.02 → 1772.90] Thank you.
[1772.90 → 1773.08] Thank you.
[1774.12 → 1774.38] Thank you.
[1774.38 → 1786.58] Take me back to the place that feels like home
[1786.58 → 1789.44] To the people I can depend on
[1789.44 → 1792.64] To the faith that's in my bones
[1792.64 → 1797.38] Take me back to a preacher and a verse
[1797.38 → 1800.06] Where they've seen me at my worst
[1800.06 → 1802.74] To the love I had at first
[1802.74 → 1806.82] Oh, I want to go to church
[1806.82 → 1813.78] Tried to walk on my own, but I wound up lost
[1813.78 → 1819.26] Now I'm making my way to the foot of the cross
[1819.26 → 1823.42] It's not a trophy for the winners
[1823.42 → 1826.44] It's a shelter for the sinners
[1826.44 → 1829.12] And it's right where I belong
[1829.12 → 1834.48] Take me back to the place that feels like home
[1834.48 → 1837.44] To the people I can depend on
[1837.44 → 1840.28] To the faith that's in my bones
[1840.28 → 1845.30] Take me back to a preacher and a verse
[1845.30 → 1848.02] Where they've seen me at my worst
[1848.02 → 1850.66] To the love I had at first
[1850.66 → 1854.74] I want to go to church
[1854.74 → 1859.86] I want to go to church
[1859.86 → 1867.66] Oh, more than an obligation
[1867.66 → 1870.58] It's not our foundation
[1870.58 → 1872.58] The family of God
[1872.58 → 1873.58] The family of God
[1873.58 → 1874.58] I know it's hard
[1874.58 → 1875.58] I know it's hard
[1875.58 → 1878.38] But we need to turn
[1878.38 → 1879.70] This is the same
[1879.70 → 1881.62] It's not our fault
[1881.62 → 1882.62] To the people that I'm making my way to the Lord
[1882.62 → 1883.62] I know it's hard
[1883.62 → 1884.62] I know it's hard
[1884.62 → 1885.94] To the people I can depend on
[1885.94 → 1887.94] To the people I can depend on
[1887.94 → 1889.94] To the people I can depend on
[1889.94 → 1891.94] To the faith that's in my bones
[1891.94 → 1895.94] Take me back to a preacher and a verse
[1895.94 → 1897.94] Where they've seen me at my worst
[1897.94 → 1899.94] Where they've seen me at my worst
[1899.94 → 1902.94] To the love I had at first
[1902.94 → 1905.94] Oh, I want to go to church
[1905.94 → 1908.94] Yeah, I want to go to church
[1908.94 → 1912.94] Take me back to the church
[1912.94 → 1916.94] Take me back to the church
[1916.94 → 1922.94] Oh, I want to go to church
[1922.94 → 1926.94] Take me back to the church
[1926.94 → 1931.94] I want to go to church
[1931.94 → 1935.94] Take me back to church
[1935.94 → 1937.94] Oh, I want to go to church

[1941.94 → 1943.94] Oh, I want to go to church
[1943.94 → 1944.94] Oh, I want to go to church
[1944.94 → 1947.94] More than all we ask
[1947.94 → 1950.94] Than all we seek
[1950.94 → 1954.94] All our hopes and dreams
[1954.94 → 1959.94] You are immeasurably more
[1959.94 → 1962.94] Than we can know
[1962.94 → 1965.94] Than we can pray
[1965.94 → 1969.94] All our words can say
[1969.94 → 1974.94] You are immeasurably more
[1974.94 → 1978.94] There's nothing greater than your love
[1978.94 → 1981.94] You're more than we can imagine
[1981.94 → 1986.94] There's nothing sweeter on this earth
[1986.94 → 1990.94] You're more than we can imagine
[1990.94 → 1993.94] Our hearts respond to who you are
[1993.94 → 1996.94] It's you, oh Lord, that we adore
[1996.94 → 2011.94] You are more than we can imagine
[2011.94 → 2013.94] in your love
[2013.94 → 2021.94] than we are
[2021.94 → 2023.94] Both pro Manuel
[2023.94 → 2024.94] like I will
[2024.94 → 2026.94] more than you
[2026.94 → 2027.88] than you are
[2027.88 → 2028.94] into all our hearts
[2028.94 → 2029.94] the truth is
[2030.94 → 2032.94] Slowly will
[2032.94 → 2036.24] Stronger than the brave
[2036.24 → 2040.42] You are immeasurably more
[2040.42 → 2043.30] I can't help but think
[2043.30 → 2047.16] I can't help but praise
[2047.16 → 2050.34] My heart cannot contain
[2050.34 → 2055.08] You are immeasurably more
[2055.08 → 2060.98] There's nothing greater than your love
[2060.98 → 2064.02] You're more than we can imagine
[2064.02 → 2068.16] There's nothing sweeter on this earth
[2068.16 → 2071.32] You're more than we can imagine
[2071.32 → 2075.42] Our hearts respond to who you are
[2075.42 → 2078.88] But you are more than we adore
[2078.88 → 2081.88] You are more, you are more
[2081.88 → 2085.72] You are more than we can imagine
[2085.72 → 2089.16] You are more, you are more
[2089.16 → 2093.20] You are more than we can imagine
[2093.20 → 2108.42] You are more than we can imagine

[2132.22 → 2133.22] You are fine
[2133.22 → 2145.30] No eye has seen, no ear has heard
[2145.30 → 2150.88] What is coming, what is coming
[2150.88 → 2159.68] Never ends in joy, never fail in love
[2159.68 → 2165.92] You are coming, you are coming
[2165.92 → 2174.16] No eye has seen, no ear has heard
[2174.16 → 2179.90] What is coming, what is coming
[2179.90 → 2188.40] Never ends in joy, never fail in love
[2188.40 → 2194.64] You are coming, you are coming
[2194.64 → 2208.64] You are coming, you are coming
[2208.64 → 2216.14] There's nothing greater than your love
[2216.14 → 2219.06] The more than we can imagine
[2219.06 → 2223.36] There's nothing sweeter on this life
[2223.36 → 2226.48] The more than we can imagine
[2226.48 → 2230.60] Our hearts respond to who you are
[2230.60 → 2233.98] But you are the one that we adore
[2233.98 → 2237.06] You are more, you are more

[2539.40 → 2545.40] holy father in heaven

[2547.40 → 2552.40] your name is exalted above the heavens
[2552.40 → 2558.40] we lift your name overall because you created all things
[2558.40 → 2564.40] you love us all of your days, and you keep us in your hands
[2564.40 → 2569.40] from the moment that we wake up until we lay down our heads
[2569.40 → 2571.40] we sing of your goodness
[2571.40 → 2573.40] you are faithful
[2575.40 → 2580.40] we thank you for your spirit and grace that brings us all here together in this place
[2581.40 → 2584.40] we thank you for all your goodness this past year
[2586.40 → 2590.40] we each have our hopes and expectations for the year that is ahead of us
[2590.40 → 2594.40] but you alone know what it holds for us
[2594.40 → 2601.40] and only you can give us the strength and the wisdom that we need to meet its challenges
[2601.40 → 2606.40] help us to humbly put our lives into your hands
[2606.40 → 2610.40] and to trust you and seek your will this coming year
[2610.40 → 2615.40] in the midst of all of life's uncertainties
[2615.40 → 2620.40] assure us of the certainty of your unchanging love
[2620.40 → 2626.40] in the midst of life's temptations and the pull of our stubborn self will
[2627.40 → 2629.40] help us not to lose our way
[2629.40 → 2632.40] but to have the courage to do what is right
[2632.40 → 2634.40] and regardless of the cost
[2634.40 → 2638.40] oh lord guide our way
[2639.40 → 2644.40] we pray for Elise Wagoner's dad Doug Tendon
[2644.40 → 2647.40] we pray that you will bring healing
[2647.40 → 2651.40] we pray that you will give wisdom and direction for his care
[2652.40 → 2658.40] we pray that you will bring comfort and peace to Doug and the rest of the family as they navigate through this time

[2679.40 → 2682.40] that they need at this time
[2683.40 → 2687.40] Lord we ask that for those who have recently gone through cancer treatments
[2687.40 → 2690.40] that you will give complete healing and hope for the future
[2690.40 → 2699.40] Lord we ask that your hand will be over this world wherever there is war and strife
[2699.40 → 2706.40] we pray that you will comfort and protect your children that are persecuted for your name's sake
[2706.40 → 2712.40] we ask for your protection for this church family
[2712.40 → 2718.40] we pray that you will continue to bless the ongoing ministries of this church
[2718.40 → 2722.40] sustain us in the present and guide us into the future
[2723.40 → 2726.40] as we hear from your word
[2726.40 → 2732.40] and your will for us this morning through the word preached by Pastor Chris
[2733.40 → 2735.40] bind us together in Christ
[2736.40 → 2738.40] keep us focused on your purpose
[2739.40 → 2741.40] and fill us with the Holy Spirit
[2742.40 → 2745.40] we pray that we will grow in love and truth
[2746.40 → 2748.40] righteousness, peace, hope and faith
[2749.40 → 2753.40] help us to grow in Jesus that we might become more and more like him
[2753.40 → 2755.40] in character and soul
[2756.40 → 2759.40] fulfill your will and purposes among us
[2760.40 → 2761.40] advance your kingdom through us
[2762.40 → 2763.40] so that your holy name is glorified
[2764.40 → 2768.40] we pray all these things in your holy name
[2769.40 → 2770.40] Amen
[2783.40 → 2799.40] this is the time of year when many people
[2800.40 → 2802.40] have spent some time looking back on the year that was
[2803.40 → 2807.40] but more than that are looking forward to the year that will be
[2808.40 → 2809.40] the year that's coming ahead
[2809.40 → 2814.40] and even as we think about everything that happened in this past year
[2815.40 → 2816.40] whether joyous or tumultuous
[2817.40 → 2819.40] we look forward with a little bit of hope
[2820.40 → 2822.40] to whatever this next year might be
[2823.40 → 2828.40] and in that as we are hoping and thinking about what is to come
[2829.40 → 2836.40] I suspect and imagine that we can't help but think of the kinds of things
[2836.40 → 2839.40] we might be waiting for
[2840.40 → 2842.40] and then maybe it's something simple in your life
[2843.40 → 2844.40] something you are waiting for
[2844.40 → 2846.40] maybe it's a package on the doorstep
[2847.40 → 2851.40] although with Amazon these days that happens at least at my house like every other day
[2852.40 → 2854.40] so there's not a lot of anticipation because it comes so quickly
[2855.40 → 2859.40] maybe you're hoping in the middle of the day for the end of a long work day
[2859.40 → 2862.40] or maybe you're hoping for something deeper
[2863.40 → 2865.40] maybe you're hoping for a relationship to heal
[2866.40 → 2868.40] or for a body to heal
[2869.40 → 2871.40] maybe you're waiting and hoping for a career breakthrough
[2872.40 → 2878.40] maybe you are coming into this new year waiting for an answer to prayer
[2878.40 → 2883.40] as we wait
[2884.40 → 2887.40] and as we have these hopes
[2888.40 → 2891.40] I want to encourage us
[2892.40 → 2894.40] this morning and for the next little while
[2895.40 → 2898.40] to zoom up from that experience
[2899.40 → 2901.40] as I want to ask
[2901.40 → 2910.40] how does what you're waiting for shape the way you live right now
[2911.40 → 2913.40] now again we've already mentioned Amazon
[2914.40 → 2918.40] but in our culture things are pretty immediate
[2919.40 → 2920.40] right?
[2921.40 → 2923.40] most of us don't have to wait long for things
[2924.40 → 2925.40] and so the discipline of waiting
[2926.40 → 2928.40] the discipline of delayed gratification
[2928.40 → 2931.40] isn't something that we have to wrestle with often anymore
[2932.40 → 2935.40] but that's what we're being invited to right now
[2936.40 → 2939.40] we're going to jump into a new series here at Emmanuel
[2940.40 → 2941.40] for a little while
[2942.40 → 2944.40] in the two letters to the Thessalonians
[2945.40 → 2947.40] so to the church at Thessalonica
[2948.40 → 2951.40] for the Thessalonian believers in the church there
[2952.40 → 2953.40] the answer was clear
[2954.40 → 2956.40] the answer of what they were waiting for is clear
[2956.40 → 2958.40] they're waiting for Jesus
[2959.40 → 2960.40] and not just figuratively
[2961.40 → 2962.40] but literally
[2963.40 → 2964.40] they're waiting for his return
[2965.40 → 2966.40] right? Just as he promised he would
[2967.40 → 2968.40] their hope isn't wishful thinking
[2969.40 → 2974.40] it was a certainty that shaped everything about their lives
[2975.40 → 2977.40] their courage under persecution
[2978.40 → 2979.40] shaped their priorities
[2980.40 → 2981.40] as they waited it shaped their purposes
[2982.40 → 2983.40] as they did life together
[2983.40 → 2988.40] and so we are left with the same question
[2989.40 → 2991.40] what are we waiting for?
[2992.40 → 2994.40] and if we're waiting for Jesus
[2995.40 → 2996.40] does that change how we live today
[2997.40 → 3000.40] or is that just something that kind of exists in the background
[3001.40 → 3002.40] in the language of the pastor on Sunday
[3003.40 → 3006.40] but doesn't really impact my day-to-day being and operating in the world
[3007.40 → 3009.40] as we dig into these letters to the Thessalonians
[3010.40 → 3029.40] Paul wants us to see God is inviting us to consider how the hope of Jesus return is meant to fuel our faith and transform our lives and give us strength for whatever we're waiting for in the here and now
[3029.40 → 3034.40] so what are you waiting for?
[3035.40 → 3036.40] and how is it changing you?
[3037.40 → 3047.40] we're going to start this morning with a really long text for our reflection in 1 Thessalonians 1 verse 1
[3047.40 → 3049.40] that's it
[3050.40 → 3051.40] it's going to be on the screen behind me
[3052.40 → 3056.40] I encourage you as always open your Bible
[3057.40 → 3058.40] we'll have it in front of you
[3059.40 → 3060.40] we will refer back and around variously
[3061.40 → 3064.40] but we'll start here in this first verse
[3064.40 → 3068.40] Paul, Silas, and Timothy
[3069.40 → 3072.40] to the church of the Thessalonians
[3073.40 → 3075.40] in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
[3076.40 → 3077.40] grace and peace to you
[3078.40 → 3080.40] this is the word of the Lord
[3083.40 → 3084.40] now as we begin
[3085.40 → 3088.40] just a little bit of background on these two letters
[3088.40 → 3092.40] the two letters and the city of Thessalonica
[3093.40 → 3095.40] or Thessaloniki in modern day Greek
[3096.40 → 3100.40] these two letters are written only a few months apart
[3101.40 → 3106.40] and many scholars believe these are actually the first letters written by Paul
[3107.40 → 3111.40] although some people argue that that's that privilege belongs to Galatians
[3111.40 → 3115.40] what this means is that these letters are written
[3116.40 → 3117.40] sometime
[3118.40 → 3125.40] 17 to 20 years after Jesus' resurrection and ascension
[3126.40 → 3132.40] which I at least think is cool and makes them worth reading
[3133.40 → 3137.40] because they give us a glimpse into the incredible scope of the spread of the gospel
[3137.40 → 3142.40] a glimpse into the speed of its spread throughout the Roman Empire
[3143.40 → 3148.40] and they give us a glimpse of its immediate social impact as the church
[3149.40 → 3151.40] from its off is being persecuted
[3152.40 → 3159.40] now what's also neat I think is that the content of these two short letters coming as quickly as they do
[3160.40 → 3165.40] to us teach us something about the content of Paul's missionary preaching
[3165.40 → 3169.40] while he was moving around the area of the Mediterranean Sea there
[3170.40 → 3177.40] these two letters are filled with references to Jesus' second coming
[3178.40 → 3185.40] in fact there's at least one reference every chapter spanning both letters to the second coming of Jesus
[3186.40 → 3192.40] and then that question is asked how does that hope that belief that reality
[3192.40 → 3195.40] transform everyday life
[3195.40 → 3205.40] and how does that reality that hope transforming everyday life challenge the cultural assumptions of the world
[3206.40 → 3211.40] and the calling of people in the world to something other to something holy
[3211.40 → 3215.40] in short
[3216.40 → 3223.40] right faith in Jesus doesn't make sense without his resurrection and without his future return
[3224.40 → 3227.40] right his resurrection and his future return
[3228.40 → 3232.40] transforms everything about our living faith right now
[3232.40 → 3233.40] now
[3233.40 → 3234.40] now
[3234.40 → 3235.40] now
[3235.40 → 3236.40] sometimes
[3236.40 → 3237.40] and maybe you have heard this before
[3238.40 → 3241.40] but Christians can be criticized
[3242.40 → 3257.40] saying that we don't care about the world because there's this really wrong and bad idea that Christians believe that somehow the world is just going to be burned up, and we're all going to be taken away out of it that our goal is to escape and to leave this world behind
[3257.40 → 3258.40] now
[3258.40 → 3261.40] now that may be true for some people and some Christians
[3261.40 → 3262.40] it's not true of the Bible
[3263.40 → 3264.40] though
[3265.40 → 3276.40] in fact as Lion Duncan says that Paul's point in Thessalonians is that our eternal confidence does not rob us of the capacity to care about the world and people in it
[3276.40 → 3279.40] instead it empowers us to care
[3279.40 → 3280.40] right
[3280.40 → 3291.40] it's precisely because of the resurrection of Jesus and his future return and the restoration of all things that we care about this world about the kingdom of God being manifest within it
[3292.40 → 3294.40] now
[3294.40 → 3295.40] Paul
[3296.40 → 3297.40] visits
[3297.40 → 3298.40] Macedonia
[3298.40 → 3299.40] which is modern day Greece
[3300.40 → 3301.40] sometime around
[3301.40 → 3302.40] A.D. 49
[3302.40 → 3303.40] or 50
[3303.40 → 3306.40] in and around there
[3306.40 → 3307.40] now
[3307.40 → 3308.40] Thessalonica
[3308.40 → 3313.40] is the capital and the largest city of Macedonia
[3313.40 → 3314.40] I think we have a map
[3315.40 → 3316.40] that we can throw up
[3317.40 → 3318.40] it's a busy seaport
[3319.40 → 3323.40] and the Via Ignacio ran right through it
[3324.40 → 3327.40] now the Via Ignacio is a road that's
[3328.40 → 3331.40] spans starting in Byzantium
[3331.40 → 3339.40] and runs along the north of Macedonia to a city called Dracaena which is modern day Dumas in Albania
[3340.40 → 3348.40] which from there if you can see the map is just a short ride across to the Italian peninsula and then on up to Rome
[3348.40 → 3350.40] the Via Ignacio
[3350.40 → 3355.40] the Via Ignacio connects Rome to the eastern half of the empire
[3355.40 → 3361.40] any land trade that happens or road routes run through Thessalonica
[3362.40 → 3373.40] it's a commonly understood historical fact that the Rome was able to spread its empire and its influence and rule so dramatically and drastically because of the roads that the Rome was able to spread its empire and its influence and rule so
[3373.40 → 3374.40] the Via Ignacio
[3374.40 → 3376.40] the Via Ignacio
[3376.40 → 3377.40] the Via Ignacio
[3378.40 → 3383.40] the city of Thessalonica has about 200,000 inhabitants at this time
[3384.40 → 3386.40] which is actually quite huge
[3387.40 → 3391.40] considering that the global population at this time is estimated to be about 200 million
[3391.40 → 3400.40] so 0.1% of the world lived in Thessalonica
[3400.40 → 3406.40] now Paul when he visits stays for only three weeks
[3406.40 → 3410.40] and his time is marked by his preaching in the synagogue
[3410.40 → 3416.40] now that Thessalonica has a synagogue is another indication that it's a large and diverse city
[3416.40 → 3420.40] you can read about this in Acts 17
[3421.40 → 3423.40] the effect of Paul's preaching there
[3423.40 → 3425.40] he would go on the Sabbath to the synagogue and preach
[3425.40 → 3429.40] and the effect we can read is that some of the Jews were persuaded
[3430.40 → 3434.40] along with many God-fearing Greeks and quite a few prominent women
[3435.40 → 3440.40] now in due course as regularly happens in Paul's missionary journeys
[3440.40 → 3447.40] a group of Jews begin to gather and create trouble
[3447.40 → 3453.40] they take some of the believers who had converted because of Paul's preaching and message
[3453.40 → 3455.40] and take them in front of the city officials
[3456.40 → 3462.40] and they charge them with saying that there is a king other than Caesar whose name is Jesus
[3463.40 → 3467.40] now this becomes another repeated and regular pattern throughout the early church
[3467.40 → 3472.40] and when that happens Paul and Silas slip away at night
[3472.40 → 3475.40] and they go to the next city into Berea
[3476.40 → 3479.40] from there they go to Athens and then on to Corinth
[3480.40 → 3483.40] Timothy stays behind in Berea
[3484.40 → 3490.40] and Paul sends word to Timothy to check on the believers in Thessalonica
[3490.40 → 3493.40] and so Timothy goes from Berea back to Thessalonica
[3493.40 → 3495.40] and so Timothy goes from Berea back to Thessalonica
[3496.40 → 3499.40] visits with them and then joins Paul in Corinth
[3500.40 → 3508.40] and it's Timothy's encouraging report to Paul in Corinth that precipitates this letter
[3509.40 → 3511.40] he's encouraged by their continuing of their belief
[3512.40 → 3517.40] and he rejoices in what God is doing among them even in the face of persecution
[3517.40 → 3527.40] now Paul's second letter what we call second Thessalonians is occasioned by news from the group of people
[3528.40 → 3532.40] who likely delivered the first letter to the church in Thessalonica
[3533.40 → 3538.40] when they returned Paul hears from them how persecution has worsened
[3539.40 → 3541.40] how their life has become harder and more challenging
[3541.40 → 3544.40] and so he wants to encourage them all the more
[3544.40 → 3548.40] and through both of these letters
[3549.40 → 3550.40] here's what we see
[3551.40 → 3554.40] right? Paul encourages the church to stay strong
[3555.40 → 3556.40] and endure
[3557.40 → 3561.40] and you can see this already if your Bibles are open in chapter 1 verse 9 and 10
[3562.40 → 3563.40] right?
[3563.40 → 3565.40] to endure by turning to God from idols
[3565.40 → 3567.40] to serve the living and true God
[3568.40 → 3570.40] and to wait for his son from heaven
[3571.40 → 3572.40] right?
[3573.40 → 3574.40] throughout this
[3575.40 → 3576.40] these two letters
[3577.40 → 3578.40] Paul uses the hope of Christ's return
[3579.40 → 3582.40] as a means of grace to sustain us in the present
[3583.40 → 3587.40] right? Faith in Jesus doesn't make sense without his resurrection
[3587.40 → 3588.40] and without his future return
[3588.40 → 3590.40] and his resurrection and future return
[3590.40 → 3591.40] and his resurrection and future return
[3592.40 → 3594.40] transform everything about life right now
[3595.40 → 3596.40] for holy obedience
[3597.40 → 3600.40] in short
[3601.40 → 3605.40] this is about what it means to be a believer of Jesus
[3606.40 → 3608.40] a follower of the way
[3609.40 → 3614.40] early Christians were called followers of the way
[3614.40 → 3615.40] the way
[3615.40 → 3617.40] the way is a shorthand
[3618.40 → 3620.40] to refer to Jesus himself
[3621.40 → 3624.40] who said I am the way the truth and the life
[3625.40 → 3631.40] it's also a way of referring to the kind of life that Jesus calls his disciples to live
[3632.40 → 3638.40] so Matthew 7 we read for the gate is wide, and the way is easy that leads to destruction
[3638.40 → 3648.40] and those who enter by it are many for the gate is nor narrow and the way is hard that leads to life and those who find it are few
[3649.40 → 3656.40] followers of Jesus are those who follow the way on the way to eternal life
[3657.40 → 3663.40] and the letters to the Thessalonians are meant to be an encouragement for when that narrow way is hard
[3663.40 → 3668.40] a reminder of who you are and what you signed up for
[3669.40 → 3671.40] and that's where we begin
[3672.40 → 3681.40] the idea in these this first verse that the gospel of Jesus can transform a people and a city
[3682.40 → 3686.40] this is about your identity in Christ
[3686.40 → 3695.40] and I mean I need you to bring your best selves to our listening here right because when I say identity
[3696.40 → 3701.40] I don't mean identity in the way that we use the word in our modern setting
[3702.40 → 3705.40] right where our identities are simultaneously
[3706.40 → 3709.40] something that we have to look within to figure out
[3709.40 → 3714.40] and they prove to be fickle and never fixed so we can never actually be sure if we figured out
[3715.40 → 3721.40] right in our modern world identity is something that you have to find within you and then be true to
[3722.40 → 3724.40] something that you get to discern
[3725.40 → 3733.40] that particular cultural understanding of an absolutely autonomous individualistic sense of self
[3733.40 → 3749.40] that is foreign to the culture of the ancient world, and it is foreign to an identity granted from outside a transcendent identity given to you as Christians we would say by grace through faith in Christ
[3750.40 → 3754.40] and because it is foreign
[3754.40 → 3756.40] it is alien
[3757.40 → 3759.40] and because it is alien
[3760.40 → 3766.40] it will be impossible or at least it will be really hard for most of us even us here who have been in church our whole lives
[3767.40 → 3769.40] most of us it will be hard to immediately understand
[3770.40 → 3775.40] right in fact because the identity we are talking about is alien
[3776.40 → 3779.40] it is probably going to be offensive to our understandings
[3780.40 → 3782.40] offensive to our modern sensibilities
[3782.40 → 3785.40] right that is just not how the world works
[3786.40 → 3787.40] you might say
[3788.40 → 3790.40] to which Jesus will gently respond
[3791.40 → 3793.40] sensitively and pastorally
[3794.40 → 3795.40] your world isn't working
[3796.40 → 3797.40] how about we try my way
[3798.40 → 3800.40] look
[3801.40 → 3803.40] put it bluntly
[3804.40 → 3807.40] and this is where we might start to offend people
[3808.40 → 3811.40] Jesus isn't interested
[3812.40 → 3814.40] in a BS true to yourself
[3814.40 → 3815.40] way of being
[3816.40 → 3817.40] he's interested
[3818.40 → 3819.40] in you being true to him
[3819.40 → 3823.40] Jesus isn't interested in
[3824.40 → 3826.40] in looking inside for self discovery
[3827.40 → 3829.40] he's interested that you discover yourself
[3830.40 → 3831.40] in him
[3832.40 → 3833.40] right
[3833.40 → 3834.40] Jesus doesn't want to help you
[3835.40 → 3836.40] he wants to heal you
[3837.40 → 3838.40] right
[3838.40 → 3840.40] he wants to set you free from the lie of the devil
[3840.40 → 3841.40] and the world
[3841.40 → 3842.40] that says you are on your own
[3843.40 → 3844.40] that it's up to you
[3845.40 → 3846.40] right Jesus wants to transform you
[3847.40 → 3848.40] to raise you to new life
[3849.40 → 3850.40] to take you from darkness into his light
[3851.40 → 3853.40] this isn't about becoming the best version of yourself
[3854.40 → 3857.40] this is about your being transformed into the image of Jesus Christ
[3858.40 → 3859.40] and so yeah
[3860.40 → 3863.40] you might get offended by this
[3864.40 → 3867.40] the gospel is an offence, and it's a stumbling block
[3868.40 → 3869.40] man
[3870.40 → 3872.40] if you are offended
[3873.40 → 3875.40] that's exactly the right time to ask
[3876.40 → 3879.40] am I looking at the world my way
[3880.40 → 3883.40] or is Jesus asking me to look at the world his way this morning
[3883.40 → 3889.40] am I trying to define myself, or will I let Jesus define me
[3890.40 → 3894.40] is my identity in me or is it in him
[3895.40 → 3897.40] that's the question of questions
[3898.40 → 3901.40] and it's time to start doubting our cultural assumptions
[3902.40 → 3904.40] and trust the way the truth and the life
[3905.40 → 3910.40] so who does Jesus say you are
[3910.40 → 3915.40] to the church of the Thessalonians
[3916.40 → 3917.40] in God the Father
[3918.40 → 3920.40] and the Lord Jesus Christ
[3921.40 → 3923.40] grace and peace to you
[3925.40 → 3926.40] now most of the time
[3927.40 → 3928.40] in our world today
[3929.40 → 3931.40] greetings in letters are sort of throwaway signs
[3932.40 → 3933.40] now some of you hear that and go what's a letter
[3934.40 → 3938.40] right but if you've ever had to write a reference for someone
[3938.40 → 3940.40] right to whom it may concern
[3941.40 → 3943.40] dear sir or madam
[3944.40 → 3946.40] right and if they're not throwaway lines
[3947.40 → 3948.40] they're still not very insignificant
[3949.40 → 3951.40] or not very significant right maybe you'll get a letter that says
[3952.40 → 3954.40] Mr. De Winter more likely I'll start an email that says
[3955.40 → 3956.40] hey man
[3957.40 → 3960.40] or maybe you'll find a note that says to the person who parked over the line
[3961.40 → 3962.40] I didn't break your mirror
[3962.40 → 3966.40] but sometimes
[3967.40 → 3968.40] sometimes
[3969.40 → 3971.40] greetings define a relationship
[3972.40 → 3974.40] they speak to an identity
[3975.40 → 3977.40] to the love of my life
[3978.40 → 3980.40] that's a way to start a note
[3981.40 → 3984.40] to my bride on our wedding day
[3985.40 → 3990.40] to my best friend and the only person I've ever trusted
[3990.40 → 3994.40] those are greetings that define a relationship
[3995.40 → 4001.40] now Paul's greetings in his letters at the beginning of his letters define a relationship
[4002.40 → 4005.40] a relationship that Paul has to this church as its pastor
[4006.40 → 4011.40] and a relationship that this church has to God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
[4011.40 → 4016.40] because of the gospel that tells us something about who we are
[4017.40 → 4020.40] from the off right to the church
[4021.40 → 4028.40] he says that is to the gathered ones to the called out ones to those who are set apart for eternal life
[4029.40 → 4030.40] to those disciples of the way
[4030.40 → 4031.40] the way
[4032.40 → 4035.40] now if you've been around church long enough
[4036.40 → 4037.40] that word church loses its punch
[4038.40 → 4042.40] but this is about your identity as the bride of Christ
[4043.40 → 4045.40] this is about being set apart for the purposes of God
[4046.40 → 4048.40] this is about being made holy in his name
[4049.40 → 4052.40] church isn't primarily something we do or some place that we go
[4053.40 → 4054.40] church is who you are
[4054.40 → 4058.40] and because you can't hear it in English
[4059.40 → 4061.40] right all of this use are plural
[4062.40 → 4065.40] right the church is an all you all kind of community
[4066.40 → 4070.40] right it's a body it's a family and I don't say that as cliché
[4071.40 → 4072.40] because I know that's how it sounds
[4073.40 → 4078.40] right this is the Bible's understanding of all you all's reality together
[4078.40 → 4089.40] you are not your own you were bought with a price you belong body and soul in life and a death to your faithful saviour Jesus Christ and you belong to one another
[4090.40 → 4101.40] and this is Romans 12 verse 5 in Christ we thought many form one body and each member belongs to all the others
[4101.40 → 4107.40] to the church of the Thessalonians
[4108.40 → 4114.40] now there is a sense here right in which the whole church belongs to the whole church
[4115.40 → 4120.40] that is every disciple of Jesus every follower of the way belongs to each other
[4121.40 → 4124.40] we are all one great cloud of witnesses
[4124.40 → 4134.40] and that's what we mean when we for instance in the Apostles Creed confess and profess that I believe a holy Catholic Church
[4135.40 → 4139.40] the word Catholic means literally from the whole right or belonging to the whole
[4140.40 → 4153.40] we are all the church of all times in all places to confess Christ raised from the dead and to believe that he is God's son is to be part of the Catholic Church
[4154.40 → 4159.40] but that Catholic Church has particular locations
[4160.40 → 4163.40] to the church of the Thessalonians
[4164.40 → 4167.40] right of Thessalonica
[4168.40 → 4171.40] here it's to the church of Langley
[4172.40 → 4176.40] Emmanuel the local church is the expression of the Catholic Church
[4177.40 → 4182.40] the local church grounds our experience of the Catholic Church
[4182.40 → 4198.40] or to put it another way that the spiritual reality of belonging to the whole church the body of Christ is expressed in the physical reality of being embodied geographically belonging to a local church
[4198.40 → 4209.40] now sometimes I will hear people say that they can be a Christian without belonging to a local church
[4210.40 → 4216.40] and I want to tell you 99 times out of 100 that's an oxymoronic statement
[4217.40 → 4218.40] maybe just moronic
[4219.40 → 4222.40] right to be Christian is to belong to the head
[4222.40 → 4223.40] you belong to the head
[4223.40 → 4225.40] and if you say you belong to the head
[4226.40 → 4227.40] you're part of the body
[4228.40 → 4229.40] and if you're part of the body
[4230.40 → 4232.40] you should belong to a local church
[4233.40 → 4235.40] look
[4236.40 → 4237.40] see why this matters
[4238.40 → 4239.40] right?
[4240.40 → 4241.40] your connection to a church
[4242.40 → 4243.40] marks your connection to the church
[4244.40 → 4249.40] which is the mark of your belonging to God in Jesus
[4249.40 → 4250.40] to the church of the Thessalonians
[4252.40 → 4255.40] in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
[4256.40 → 4259.40] just as these believers are in Thessalonica
[4260.40 → 4266.40] so are they in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ
[4267.40 → 4275.40] just as you are here in Langley Emmanuel so you are in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ by grace
[4275.40 → 4284.40] the spiritual reality is made tangible in the physical reality the spiritual truth is made real in the physical expression
[4285.40 → 4288.40] and this too is about your identity
[4289.40 → 4296.40] your personal relationship connects to a personal God who connects to other persons
[4297.40 → 4298.40] you can't do this alone
[4299.40 → 4302.40] but thanks be to God you're not alone
[4302.40 → 4305.40] to the church
[4306.40 → 4308.40] in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ
[4309.40 → 4311.40] grace and peace to you
[4312.40 → 4319.40] so in Greek here it actually says grace to you and peace
[4320.40 → 4324.40] Paul places them two you after grace not after the word peace
[4324.40 → 4329.40] not after the word peace and in Greek word order can indicate priority
[4330.40 → 4333.40] grace precedes peace results
[4334.40 → 4338.40] to be a follower of the way is to have received grace
[4339.40 → 4341.40] we are defined by grace by God's grace
[4342.40 → 4347.40] it is grace that makes us in God and in the Lord Jesus Christ
[4347.40 → 4354.40] maybe you know the old hymn grace grace grace God's grace that erases all my sin
[4355.40 → 4360.40] if you don't know that one maybe you know amazing grace how sweet the sound I once was lost, but now I'm
[4361.40 → 4365.40] found right it is by grace you have been saved through faith
[4365.40 → 4369.40] this is not of yourselves it is the gift of God grace alone
[4370.40 → 4371.40] sold Gratian
[4372.40 → 4375.40] the truth of the gospel
[4376.40 → 4379.40] is that Jesus Christ God himself
[4380.40 → 4381.40] the word
[4382.40 → 4383.40] who took on flesh
[4384.40 → 4392.40] came into this world and lived the life I should have lived that is he kept perfectly the demands of God and law
[4392.40 → 4403.40] he kept perfectly the righteous requirements of what is needed in order to come into the presence of a holy perfect God
[4404.40 → 4417.40] and he died the death that I deserve even though he was perfectly righteous he took the punishment for my sin for your sin for the sins of the world all who would believe
[4417.40 → 4418.40] believe
[4420.40 → 4421.40] this is the gospel
[4422.40 → 4423.40] and grace
[4424.40 → 4425.40] applies his merit
[4426.40 → 4427.40] and grace
[4428.40 → 4429.40] removes my demerit
[4430.40 → 4434.40] right and the result of grace is peace
[4435.40 → 4437.40] grace to you and peace
[4438.40 → 4441.40] restored to God living in wholeness
[4442.40 → 4443.40] that's what real peace is
[4443.40 → 4444.40] is
[4444.40 → 4449.40] living in peace is motivated, and it is made alive in us by grace
[4450.40 → 4465.40] and that living then is fuelled by it is mobilized by more grace being manifested in the hope of Christ's return and the fulfillment of that peace in a world restored and completely renewed
[4465.40 → 4475.40] the gospel of Jesus transforms a people and the city
[4476.40 → 4479.40] because the people who gather in the church
[4480.40 → 4482.40] people who gather as the church
[4483.40 → 4488.40] the people who gather in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ
[4488.40 → 4490.40] are sent out
[4491.40 → 4492.40] to a city
[4493.40 → 4497.40] you go from this place transformed in order to transform
[4498.40 → 4513.40] you go as witnesses to and a herald of the kingdom come in your hearts by grace and the kingdom come in your lives as you live out that grace and the kingdom coming in the world around us as others are called into this relationship with God and the kingdom coming yet even more by the kingdom of God.
[4513.40 → 4520.40] that is your message that is your message that is your hope and that changes everything about how we live right now because it changes who you are.
[4520.40 → 4529.40] maybe for the first time in your life you know real humanity because you've met the real Jesus.
[4530.40 → 4543.40] waiting for Jesus fuels our mission right now and and and and
[4543.40 → 4544.78] Because you've met the real Jesus.
[4546.44 → 4550.90] Waiting for Jesus fuels our mission right now.
[4552.26 → 4557.58] So we wait with our eyes fixed on his return.
[4558.60 → 4562.44] But as we will see, our waiting is not idle.
[4563.52 → 4565.16] That is, we're not sitting still.
[4566.02 → 4567.12] We are sent.
[4567.52 → 4568.50] We are commissioned.
[4568.50 → 4574.54] We are called out with this message.
[4575.62 → 4580.66] And this message alone is what will transform the world.
[4581.92 → 4585.34] This is your message.

[4587.54 → 4588.46] Let's pray together.
[4588.46 → 4599.60] Lord Jesus, today you have reminded us who we are.
[4600.86 → 4607.38] And you've done that, Lord willing, by reminding us who you are.
[4608.06 → 4609.20] And what you have done.
[4609.44 → 4610.46] And what you will do.
[4611.10 → 4613.46] And, Lord God, what you are doing.
[4613.46 → 4624.60] So as we look back, as we look around, and as we look ahead, may we fix our eyes on you.
[4625.54 → 4629.46] May we wait for you, Lord Jesus.
