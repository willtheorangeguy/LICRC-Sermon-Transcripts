[0.00 → 13.80] I fall, His love is sure, for Christ has paid for every failing, I am here forevermore.
[13.80 → 14.80] Amen.
[43.80 → 53.54] But mine is peace that flows from heaven, and the strength in times of need.
[53.54 → 63.54] I know my pain will not be wasted, Christ completes His work in me.
[73.80 → 83.68] Mine are days here as a stranger, pilgrim on a narrow way.
[83.68 → 93.68] One with Christ I will encounter, I'm in hatred for His name.
[94.10 → 103.48] But mine is armour for this battle, strong enough to last a war.
[103.80 → 113.46] And He has said, He will deliver safely to the golden shore.
[113.46 → 123.54] And mine are keys to Zion City, where beside the King I walk.
[123.92 → 133.46] For there my heart has found its treasure, Christ is mine forevermore.
[133.80 → 158.68] Come rejoice now, O my soul.
[158.68 → 163.68] For His love is my reward.
[163.68 → 168.62] Fear is gone and hope is sure.
[168.62 → 173.74] Christ is mine forevermore.
[173.74 → 178.74] Come rejoice now, O my soul.
[178.74 → 179.74] For His love is my reward.
[179.74 → 183.74] For His love is my reward.
[183.74 → 184.74] Fear is gone and hope is sure.
[184.74 → 185.74] Fear is gone and hope is sure.
[185.74 → 186.74] Christ is mine forevermore.
[186.74 → 187.74] Come rejoice now, O my soul.
[187.74 → 188.74] Come rejoice now, O my soul.
[188.74 → 190.74] For His love is my reward.
[190.74 → 192.74] Fear is gone and hope is sure.
[192.74 → 193.74] Christ is mine forevermore.
[193.74 → 194.74] Come rejoice now, O my soul.
[194.74 → 195.74] Come rejoice now, O my soul.
[195.74 → 197.74] Come rejoice now, O my soul.
[197.74 → 199.74] For His love is my reward.
[199.74 → 200.74] Fear is gone and hope is my reward.
[200.74 → 201.74] For His love is my reward.
[201.74 → 206.74] Fear is gone and hope is sure.
[206.74 → 207.74] Christ is mine forevermore.
[207.74 → 208.74] Christ is mine forevermore.
[208.74 → 213.74] Christ is mine forevermore.
[213.74 → 215.74] And my love leaves to Zion City, where beside the King I walk.
[215.74 → 230.74] For there my heart has found its treasure.
[230.74 → 235.74] Christ is mine forevermore.
[235.74 → 237.74] Christ is mine forevermore.
[237.74 → 243.02] Christ is mine forevermore.
[243.02 → 244.86] Christ is mine forevermore.
[265.74 → 295.72] Thank you.
[295.74 → 325.72] Thank you.
[325.74 → 327.74] Thank you.
[355.74 → 357.74] Thank you.
[385.74 → 387.74] Thank you.
[415.74 → 417.74] Thank you.
[445.74 → 447.74] Thank you.
[475.74 → 477.74] Thank you.
[477.74 → 479.74] Thank you.
[479.74 → 481.74] Thank you.
[481.74 → 483.74] Thank you.
[483.74 → 485.74] Thank you.
[485.74 → 487.74] Thank you.
[487.74 → 489.74] Thank you.
[490.56 → 491.74] Thank you.
[495.74 → 497.74] Thank you.
[497.74 → 498.20] Thank you.
[499.74 → 501.74] Thank you.
[501.74 → 511.74] The roaring lion declared the grave as no claim on me.
[513.08 → 518.08] Jesus, yours is the victory.
[520.90 → 525.74] Oh, hallelujah.
[525.74 → 530.16] Praise the one who set me free.
[530.16 → 532.16] Hallelujah.
[533.84 → 536.78] Today's lost is great for me.
[537.08 → 540.16] You have broken every chain.
[540.54 → 542.34] This now makes sense.
[545.06 → 546.46] Good morning, everyone.
[547.62 → 548.62] Good morning.
[549.34 → 549.92] Good to hear you.
[550.40 → 555.02] Welcome to Emanuel Church this morning on this beautiful snowy Sunday morning.
[555.16 → 557.64] To those of us that brave the weather, it's good to see you all here.
[557.64 → 561.90] And it's good to be here together to worship our Lord this morning.
[563.06 → 564.26] I'm Ken Hogging.
[564.38 → 566.06] I'm an elder here at Emanuel Church.
[566.64 → 575.78] And just as we're opening up before the service starts here, I'd like to just check if anyone had any announcements that they wanted to make.
[575.78 → 578.30] Not seeing anyone running up here.
[578.36 → 578.50] Okay.
[578.84 → 579.92] I will make a couple.
[580.16 → 580.78] I'm just...
[581.94 → 582.44] Oh, hey.
[582.52 → 582.98] We got Brandon.
[583.10 → 583.30] Excellent.
[583.40 → 585.78] I was just going to make an announcement on his behalf, but...
[586.78 → 587.18] Okay.
[587.34 → 590.16] I'll go through a couple other things as Brandon's making his way up here.
[590.16 → 597.72] So, I'm sure he will talk about the Mexico mission and some upcoming things with that.
[598.12 → 607.90] There is the membership project going on where we're collecting information and contact and just updating the database of information about each of our members in the church.
[607.90 → 615.16] So, please check the e-bulletin for the link or the QR code to get into that and to fill in your entry.
[615.54 → 619.34] If you need any help with that, reach out to the church office, and they'll be happy to help.
[620.90 → 623.90] Coldest Night of the Year is coming up on February 22nd.
[624.68 → 627.96] Something our church has always participated in quite strongly.
[627.96 → 632.96] So, check out the e-bulletin, or you can probably talk to Nikki Robert for information about that.
[634.02 → 637.96] And there is a youth coffee today at...
[638.48 → 639.58] Let's see.
[639.68 → 640.92] That would be at Trudy Baumann's place.
[641.54 → 647.50] And information was emailed about that also in the e-bulletin if anyone's looking for details.
[648.86 → 650.42] I think that's it.
[650.50 → 652.72] If there's anything else you want to know about, check out the e-bulletin.
[652.80 → 653.56] There's lots of stuff in there.
[653.64 → 655.64] That's all I've got going for me right now as well.
[655.64 → 658.26] So, I'll turn it over to Brandon to talk about the Mexico mission.
[659.70 → 661.32] Yeah, just two announcements for Mexico.
[661.68 → 662.62] One is, yeah, the dinner.
[662.78 → 663.50] Reminder for that.
[663.76 → 667.32] The sign-up has gone out in the e-bulletin and the midweek memo.
[667.98 → 670.62] So, you sign up there, or you can sign up at the back on the window there.
[670.72 → 672.74] There's a paper sign-up for those who prefer that.
[673.54 → 675.60] It's beef brisket, smoked brisket, tacos.
[676.42 → 681.18] Doors open 530 and $30 a person, $15 for a kid under 12.
[681.18 → 686.36] And then for other kids or adults that you parents don't want to watch, we have childcare by donation as well.
[686.94 → 687.72] So, that's the first one.
[687.84 → 688.62] Second one as well.
[688.72 → 690.70] Today we'll start the Neufeld's fundraiser.
[691.28 → 695.88] I'll be sending out all the info to the youth and leaders that they can send to you today just after church.
[697.10 → 699.90] Just a couple of things on that aren't clear.
[700.00 → 700.30] Hey, hey.
[700.92 → 701.24] Founder.
[701.24 → 708.12] A couple of things for that one that's changed this year is, number one, you have to pay ahead of time.
[708.68 → 710.50] It used to be that you paid your youth and whatnot.
[710.96 → 712.98] Now, Neufeld's is collecting all the payment for us.
[713.52 → 718.14] That means when you do your order at the end, it'll go do a little confirmation screen, and you pay by visa there.
[718.76 → 719.98] It just makes it easier for us.
[720.04 → 721.14] It makes it easier for Neufeld's.
[721.18 → 722.66] Nobody's chasing funds and all that.
[722.92 → 724.52] Your order will not go through if you don't pay.
[724.52 → 728.94] So, if you show up to pick it up and there's no order, it means you didn't pay.
[729.84 → 731.84] But it'll do all that for you.
[732.38 → 734.70] And the second one is Neufeld's also has changed.
[735.10 → 736.98] Our youth used to deliver it to you guys.
[738.06 → 740.34] Neufeld's has changed that for us, I guess.
[740.46 → 742.26] They don't want that.
[742.34 → 745.42] They want you guys to actually come and pick it up from the truck here.
[746.20 → 750.78] So, when you buy it, they give you an email and all that that says, hey, 4.30, come pick it up.
[750.78 → 754.94] But maybe don't show up quite at 4.30, even though they say to, just because that's what the truck's setting up.
[755.44 → 760.16] Maybe, let's say, like 5 o'clock or so, you can come pick up your food.
[760.30 → 762.66] 4.45, 5 o'clock would be awesome.
[762.82 → 767.26] So, the pickup is February 28th, and the ordering will go up until basically then.
[768.42 → 768.66] And, yeah.
[768.92 → 774.28] The last thing is, too, I know a couple of people also would prefer, like, oh, can we store it in the fridge overnight?
[774.28 → 777.44] The church does not have large fridges, nor do they always work great.
[777.56 → 779.74] So, we cannot store your Neufeld's order here.
[780.78 → 783.60] But that's just kind of going to be a thing going forward for that.
[784.88 → 788.58] And then the last thing with that, too, I guess it's last, last, last thing.
[790.42 → 797.54] There's also, for those of you that I know some of you guys are like, oh, the youth never contacted me or the leaders never contacted me, but I'd like to order and support the trip.
[798.06 → 801.76] If you go to the sign-up, there is a little option for General Pot, it's called.
[801.76 → 810.06] And that goes to just our generic, our general ministry funds, like our building in Mexico, some of the VBS, the evangelism, things like that.
[810.06 → 814.54] All of that is fundraised separately from the kids as just a general pot.
[815.04 → 816.44] So, you can order from that as well.
[816.98 → 821.08] And what we'll do is we're going to give the kids, like, three, four days to kind of contact you guys first.
[821.44 → 822.98] And then we'll send it out in the midweek memo.
[823.36 → 826.30] And if you haven't been contacted, you're going to feel free to order from the general pot.
[826.30 → 831.58] Or if you prefer to, if you like one of the kids really a lot, but they didn't contact you, you can order from them as well.
[831.66 → 832.60] Just give them a heads-up.
[832.68 → 834.94] Otherwise, they may not know you ordered from them.
[835.12 → 837.58] So, yeah, that's basically it for Mexico.
[839.80 → 840.44] Thank you, Brandon.
[841.22 → 845.92] So, this morning we have a guest pastor that we're privileged to have leaded us in worship this morning.
[846.22 → 849.66] I'd like to introduce Sean Jung from New Life CRC.
[849.66 → 851.84] He will be leading us in worship this morning.
[852.20 → 854.82] And we're glad to hear from you and to worship with you, Sean.
[854.96 → 855.28] Welcome.
[856.30 → 863.12] Good morning.
[863.90 → 866.84] I invite you to stand for God's greeting this morning.
[868.68 → 873.44] God's greeting comes to us from 2 Thessalonians 1, verse 2.
[874.48 → 884.18] People of the triune God, grace and peace to you from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ and all God's people said, Amen.
[884.18 → 887.92] As God has greeted us, let us also greet one another.
[887.92 → 888.00] Amen.
[888.00 → 888.02] As God has greeted us, let us also greet one another.
[888.02 → 896.68] Well, thank you for their spirit.
[899.06 → 899.52] Amen.
[899.52 → 903.58] Good morning.
[903.66 → 905.82] Merry Christmas.
[905.82 → 906.20] Mr. Johnson.
[906.20 → 908.02] I wish to answer your question.
[908.82 → 910.92] How did we plan to address it?
[910.92 → 928.76] Psalm 95 says,
[928.76 → 931.24] Come, let us sing for joy to the Lord.
[931.56 → 933.86] Let us shout aloud to the rock of our salvation.
[934.68 → 936.60] Let us come before him with Thanksgiving
[936.60 → 939.52] and extol him with music and song.
[939.52 → 942.64] For the Lord is the great God,
[943.00 → 945.36] the great King above all gods.
[945.88 → 948.52] In his hands are the depths of the earth
[948.52 → 950.50] and the mountain peaks belong to him.
[951.14 → 953.44] The sea is his for he made it.
[953.98 → 956.42] His hands formed the dry land.
[957.06 → 958.70] Come, let us bow down in worship.
[959.32 → 961.44] Let us kneel before the Lord our maker
[961.44 → 963.18] for he is our God.
[969.52 → 978.52] Come, let us worship and bow down.
[978.52 → 984.08] Let us kneel before the Lord our God, our maker.
[984.08 → 992.50] Come, let us worship and bow down.
[993.08 → 998.06] Let us kneel before the Lord our God, our maker.
[1000.20 → 1004.80] Come, let us worship and bow down.
[1004.80 → 1010.42] Let us kneel before the Lord our God, our maker.
[1011.80 → 1016.80] For he is our God.
[1016.80 → 1023.26] And we are the people of his pasture.
[1023.26 → 1025.26] And we are the people of his hand.
[1025.26 → 1027.26] And we are the people of his hand.
[1027.26 → 1029.26] And we are the people of his hand.
[1029.26 → 1035.26] Let us kneel before the Lord our God, our maker.
[1035.26 → 1041.26] Come, let us worship and bow down.
[1041.26 → 1048.26] Let us kneel before the Lord our God, our maker.
[1048.26 → 1055.26] Come, let us worship and bow down.
[1055.26 → 1061.26] Let us kneel before the Lord our God, our maker.
[1061.26 → 1067.26] For he is our God.
[1067.26 → 1073.26] And we are the people of his pasture.
[1073.26 → 1088.26] And we are the people of his pasture.
[1088.26 → 1090.26] And the sheep of his hand.
[1090.26 → 1095.26] Just the sheep of his hand.
[1095.26 → 1097.10] God.
[1125.26 → 1127.26] God.
[1155.26 → 1157.26] God.
[1185.26 → 1187.26] God.
[1215.26 → 1217.26] God.
[1245.26 → 1247.26] God.
[1275.26 → 1279.26] Your name is the highest.
[1279.26 → 1282.26] Your name is the greatest.
[1282.26 → 1288.26] Your name stands above all.
[1288.26 → 1294.26] All flows and dominions, all bouts and positions.
[1294.26 → 1299.26] Your name stands above all.
[1299.26 → 1302.26] And the angels cry.
[1302.26 → 1308.26] Holy of the ancient times.
[1308.26 → 1314.26] Holy, you are lifted high.
[1314.26 → 1323.26] Holy, holy forever.
[1323.26 → 1327.26] May your people sing.
[1327.26 → 1333.26] Holy, to the King of King.
[1333.26 → 1339.26] Holy, you will always be.
[1339.26 → 1345.26] Holy, holy forever.
[1345.26 → 1351.26] You will always be.
[1351.26 → 1355.26] Holy, holy forever.
[1355.26 → 1357.26] You will always be.
[1357.26 → 1359.26] Holy, holy forever.
[1359.26 → 1361.26] Holy, holy forever.
[1361.26 → 1365.26] Holy, holy forever.
[1365.26 → 1372.26] Please join me in a prayer of confession as we pray the words of, oh, and you can sit down.
[1372.26 → 1373.26] Thank you.
[1373.26 → 1379.26] As we pray the words of Song 662 in the red hymn, Lift Your Hearts.
[1379.26 → 1384.26] This song is titled, In an Age of Twisted Values.
[1384.26 → 1385.26] Let's pray.
[1385.26 → 1393.26] Heavenly Father, in an age of twisted values, we have lost the truth we need.
[1393.26 → 1398.26] In sophisticated language, we have justified our greed.
[1398.26 → 1403.26] By our struggle for possessions, we have robbed the poor and weak.
[1403.26 → 1406.26] Hear our cry and heal our nation.
[1406.26 → 1409.26] Your forgiveness, Lord, we seek.
[1409.26 → 1414.26] We have built discrimination on our prejudice and fear.
[1414.26 → 1419.26] Hatred swiftly turns to cruelty if we hold resentment dear.
[1419.26 → 1427.26] For communities divided by the walls of class and race, hear our cry and heal our nation.
[1427.26 → 1432.26] Show us, Lord, your love and grace.
[1432.26 → 1437.26] When our families are broken, when our homes are full of strife,
[1437.26 → 1442.26] when our children are bewildered, when they lose their way in life.
[1442.26 → 1448.26] When we fail to give the aged all the care we know we should.
[1448.26 → 1454.26] Hear our cry and heal our nation with your tender fatherhood.
[1454.26 → 1459.26] We who hear your words so often choose so rarely to obey.
[1459.26 → 1464.26] Turn us from your wilful blood, from our wilful blindness.
[1464.26 → 1466.26] Give us truth to light our way.
[1466.26 → 1472.26] In the power of your spirit, come to cleanse us, make us new.
[1472.26 → 1475.26] Hear our cry and heal our nation.
[1475.26 → 1478.26] Till our nation honours you.
[1478.26 → 1481.26] In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[1481.26 → 1484.26] Please rise as you are able.
[1484.26 → 1491.26] As we sing of the insurance of forgiveness we have because of God's amazing love for us.
[1491.26 → 1492.26] Again.
[1492.26 → 1495.22] дерев it earthed
[1503.26 → 1510.26] As we understand the presence of their Coast.
[1510.26 → 1512.26] If.
[1512.26 → 1524.18] I'm forgiven because you are forsaken
[1524.18 → 1531.00] I'm accepted you were the dead
[1531.00 → 1537.46] I'm alive and well your spirit is in me
[1537.46 → 1541.92] Because you died and rose again
[1541.92 → 1550.04] I'm forgiven because you were forsaken
[1550.04 → 1557.48] I'm accepted you were the dead
[1557.48 → 1563.32] I'm alive and well your spirit is in me
[1563.32 → 1568.28] Because you died and rose again
[1568.28 → 1576.40] Waste of all I can be
[1576.40 → 1582.40] That you my King would die for me
[1582.40 → 1589.40] Waste of all I know is true
[1589.40 → 1594.52] It's my joy to honour you
[1594.52 → 1597.52] In all I do
[1597.52 → 1601.64] I honour you
[1601.64 → 1608.76] I'm forgiven because you were forsaken
[1608.76 → 1615.64] I'm accepted you were the dead
[1615.64 → 1621.64] I'm alive and well your spirit is in me
[1621.64 → 1627.76] Because you died and rose again
[1627.76 → 1635.88] Waste of all I can be
[1635.88 → 1642.00] That you my King would die for me
[1642.00 → 1647.84] Waste of all I know is true
[1647.84 → 1653.96] It's my joy to honour you
[1653.96 → 1655.96] In all I do
[1655.96 → 1662.08] I honour you
[1662.08 → 1666.08] You are my King
[1666.08 → 1672.08] You are my King
[1672.08 → 1680.20] Jesus you are my King
[1680.20 → 1686.20] Jesus you are my King
[1686.20 → 1692.32] Waste of all I know is true
[1692.32 → 1694.32] I'm alive and well your spirit is in me
[1694.32 → 1695.44] You are my King
[1695.44 → 1696.32] To my King
[1696.32 → 1700.44] I'm alive and well your spirit is in me
[1700.44 → 1706.56] Waste of all I know is true
[1706.56 → 1712.06] It's my joy to honour you
[1712.06 → 1715.06] In all I do
[1715.06 → 1718.44] I honour you
[1718.44 → 1722.02] In all I do
[1722.02 → 1725.44] I honour you
[1730.44 → 1756.24] I love you Lord
[1756.24 → 1762.00] Oh your mercy never fails me
[1762.00 → 1765.06] All my days
[1765.06 → 1768.98] I've been held in your hands
[1768.98 → 1772.58] From the moment that I wake up
[1772.58 → 1776.00] Until I lay my hand
[1776.00 → 1781.86] I will sing of the goodness of God
[1781.86 → 1786.42] All my life
[1786.42 → 1788.80] All my life you have been faithful
[1788.80 → 1797.94] All my life you have been so, so good
[1797.94 → 1802.40] The very breath that I am able
[1802.40 → 1808.86] I will sing of the goodness of God
[1808.86 → 1815.68] I love your voice
[1815.68 → 1820.46] You have led me through the fire
[1820.46 → 1823.62] The darkest night
[1823.62 → 1827.14] You were close like no other
[1827.14 → 1830.62] I know you as a father
[1830.62 → 1834.44] I know you as a friend
[1834.44 → 1835.44] I know you as a friend
[1835.44 → 1839.44] I have lived in the goodness of God
[1839.44 → 1844.26] All my life you have been faithful
[1844.26 → 1848.26] All my life you have been faithful
[1848.26 → 1855.26] All my life you have been so, so good
[1855.26 → 1861.26] Every breath that I am able
[1861.26 → 1868.08] I will sing of the goodness of God
[1868.08 → 1872.80] Your goodness is running out
[1872.80 → 1875.80] It's running out to me
[1875.80 → 1879.40] Your goodness is running out
[1879.40 → 1882.36] It's running out to me
[1882.36 → 1884.34] My life made down
[1884.34 → 1886.04] It's a red word now
[1886.04 → 1888.14] To give you everything
[1888.14 → 1892.94] your goodness is running out
[1892.94 → 1896.58] It's running out to me
[1896.68 → 1898.08] Your goodness is running out
[1898.08 → 1907.78] It's running out to me
[1907.78 → 1914.98] My life laid down, suspended now, I give you everything.
[1916.58 → 1922.78] Your goodness is running out, it's running out to me.
[1925.36 → 1929.08] Oh, my life you have been faithful.
[1931.18 → 1937.08] Oh, my life you have been so, so good.
[1937.78 → 1948.98] With every breath that I am able, I will sing of the goodness of God.
[1950.18 → 1955.62] I will sing of the goodness of God.
[1967.78 → 1972.74] Good morning.
[1973.16 → 1974.20] My name is Yap.
[1974.28 → 1975.76] I'm a deacon here at Langley-Emmanuel.
[1976.50 → 1980.76] This morning's offering will be for Union Gospel Mission.
[1980.76 → 1987.22] They are a faith-based organization that has been around for over 80 years, supporting
[1987.22 → 1992.38] people as they rebuild their lives through providing meals, supportive housing, addiction,
[1992.60 → 1993.46] recovery, and more.
[1994.52 → 1995.96] Please give as you're able.
[1996.20 → 2000.00] If you want to give to the general budget, you can use the envelopes that are in the seats
[2000.00 → 2000.46] in front of you.
[2000.46 → 2002.02] Thank you.
[2002.02 → 2002.10] Thank you.
[2002.10 → 2032.08] Thank you.
[2032.10 → 2062.08] Thank you.
[2062.10 → 2064.10] Thank you.
[2092.10 → 2094.10] Thank you.
[2122.10 → 2124.10] Thank you.
[2152.10 → 2154.10] Thank you.
[2182.10 → 2184.10] Thank you.
[2212.10 → 2214.10] Thank you.
[2214.10 → 2216.10] Thank you.
[2216.10 → 2218.10] Thank you.
[2218.10 → 2220.10] Thank you.
[2220.10 → 2222.10] Thank you.
[2222.10 → 2224.10] Thank you.
[2224.10 → 2226.10] Thank you.
[2226.10 → 2228.10] Thank you.
[2228.10 → 2230.10] Thank you.
[2230.10 → 2232.10] Thank you.
[2232.10 → 2235.88] My Saviour forever
[2235.88 → 2240.38] He sought me and fought me
[2240.38 → 2244.24] With His redeeming blood
[2244.24 → 2248.18] He loved me ere I knew Him
[2248.18 → 2252.04] And all my love is to Him
[2252.04 → 2255.68] He plunged me to victory
[2255.68 → 2259.90] Beneath a cleansing flood
[2259.90 → 2263.84] He loved me ere I knew Him
[2263.84 → 2267.76] And all my love is to Him
[2267.76 → 2271.42] He plunged me to victory
[2271.42 → 2275.32] Beneath a cleansing flood
[2275.32 → 2284.14] Good morning, my name is Mr. Mike
[2284.14 → 2286.12] and I would like to welcome all the kids up.
[2286.12 → 2289.92] We will do a little chat and have a children's blessing
[2289.92 → 2292.24] and then we'll head to children's worship time.
[2292.94 → 2294.22] So why don't you guys join me up front.
[2294.32 → 2295.54] Oh, it's great to see so many.
[2295.66 → 2298.78] I wasn't sure if the snow would stop a lot of you guys.
[2299.26 → 2300.78] Exciting, hey, to have so much snow?
[2301.62 → 2302.62] Oh, don't get too close.
[2302.68 → 2303.84] I need a little bit of space.
[2304.92 → 2305.32] Okay.
[2306.34 → 2308.12] So in children's worship time,
[2308.18 → 2311.06] do you guys remember what we're talking about?
[2311.06 → 2315.08] The theme is Jesus is, right?
[2315.30 → 2317.78] So we're learning all these things about Jesus,
[2318.20 → 2319.40] His names,
[2319.92 → 2321.42] all these things about His character
[2321.42 → 2323.74] that help us know who He is,
[2323.84 → 2326.30] but it also helps us know who we are, right?
[2326.36 → 2328.14] Because of who He has made us to be.
[2328.68 → 2330.66] So I have a question for you guys.
[2331.62 → 2333.34] We're going to learn a little bit more about Jesus today.
[2333.72 → 2334.78] Do you guys have tables?
[2335.70 → 2336.54] Do you have a table?
[2337.04 → 2339.12] You have like probably more than one table in your house.
[2339.12 → 2340.60] Do you guys eat dinner at the table?
[2341.04 → 2341.62] Oh, yeah?
[2344.38 → 2345.68] You have more than one table?
[2346.94 → 2348.68] Oh, there's even some inside and outside.
[2349.08 → 2351.42] And do you guys do like big dinners and stuff?
[2352.06 → 2352.42] Yeah?
[2352.56 → 2353.64] Did you have some at Christmas?
[2354.34 → 2355.66] Or when like there's like your birthday?
[2356.58 → 2357.36] You have a big table,
[2357.44 → 2359.32] lots of people come and join you at the table.
[2360.18 → 2361.92] Is anybody welcome at your table?
[2362.96 → 2364.64] Could I come for dinner sometime?
[2365.38 → 2365.60] Yeah?
[2365.84 → 2367.34] Maybe we'll sign a little sign-up sheet or something?
[2367.34 → 2373.06] What about if I came to dinner and I had my cell phone with me?
[2373.50 → 2375.12] And I was always busy on my cell phone.
[2375.18 → 2376.18] Can I still come for dinner?
[2377.80 → 2378.10] I know.
[2378.38 → 2379.20] Could I still come for dinner?
[2379.76 → 2380.66] You're thinking about it.
[2380.66 → 2380.84] No?
[2380.98 → 2381.16] Maybe?
[2381.26 → 2381.40] Okay.
[2381.68 → 2382.94] Well, what if I had my cell phone
[2382.94 → 2387.20] and I decided I had to wear this little Hawaiian lei?
[2387.34 → 2388.24] Could I still come for dinner?
[2388.90 → 2389.20] Yeah?
[2389.20 → 2392.86] What about if I had my lei and my cell phone was beeping
[2392.86 → 2395.86] and I brought my mints, and I'm chewing on my mints
[2395.86 → 2398.22] and I smell like a mint bush all night?
[2398.54 → 2399.34] Am I still welcome?
[2399.82 → 2400.22] Yeah?
[2400.34 → 2400.74] Oh, okay.
[2400.80 → 2401.28] Well, that's good.
[2401.66 → 2402.42] What if I thought,
[2402.48 → 2404.32] oh, I'm going to jazz myself up
[2404.32 → 2407.56] and I'm going to wear some Christmas garland.
[2408.84 → 2410.76] Could I still come for dinner?
[2410.98 → 2411.18] Yeah.
[2411.18 → 2412.38] Are you sure?
[2413.00 → 2413.28] Yeah?
[2413.54 → 2415.02] I hope the lights work on this thing
[2415.02 → 2415.72] because that would,
[2415.80 → 2416.54] oh, they fell out.
[2417.50 → 2417.88] Darn it.
[2418.04 → 2418.28] Okay.
[2418.96 → 2420.22] What about if I thought,
[2420.28 → 2420.88] oh, I'm going to,
[2421.08 → 2422.16] I'm going to really jazz myself.
[2422.28 → 2423.14] I got my cell phone,
[2423.26 → 2424.10] I got my mints,
[2424.16 → 2424.98] I'm crunching,
[2425.18 → 2426.50] I smell like a mint bush,
[2426.84 → 2427.82] I'm wearing my garland,
[2428.12 → 2428.94] and then I decided,
[2429.02 → 2430.90] oh, I'm just going to wear this basket on my head.
[2432.34 → 2433.86] Am I still welcome at dinner?
[2434.20 → 2434.52] No.
[2434.74 → 2435.02] Really?
[2435.22 → 2435.62] No?
[2435.96 → 2438.88] It's getting a little crazy.
[2439.88 → 2441.16] You can't use me.
[2442.04 → 2444.22] I can't even see what I would be eating.
[2444.68 → 2444.84] Right?
[2445.46 → 2447.96] Well, we are going to talk a little bit more today
[2447.96 → 2451.96] about the big table that God is preparing for us
[2451.96 → 2456.30] and the table that Jesus ultimately has for all of us.
[2456.38 → 2456.56] Okay?
[2457.12 → 2458.20] So we'll talk a little bit more about that
[2458.20 → 2459.10] in Children's Worship Time.
[2459.82 → 2460.90] But before we go,
[2461.06 → 2461.70] let's stand
[2461.70 → 2464.22] and we'll bless the grown-ups
[2464.22 → 2465.56] that are going to stay here
[2465.56 → 2466.62] and listen to the pastor
[2466.62 → 2469.34] and we will go off to Children's Worship Time.
[2469.34 → 2470.96] All right.
[2472.08 → 2474.36] The Lord be with you.
[2474.56 → 2476.04] And also with you.
[2476.14 → 2476.40] Okay.
[2476.40 → 2502.28] Good morning, everyone.
[2502.28 → 2504.50] Good morning, everyone.
[2504.50 → 2509.88] Before Ken prays here, I just have a few notes from Council this past week.
[2509.88 → 2516.82] We had a Council meeting on Tuesday, and just a summary of some of the things we discussed.
[2516.82 → 2521.34] One of the big points we discussed was our intent and desire to discern the calling of
[2521.34 → 2525.36] Kevin Robert as a Minister of the Word, as most of you know.
[2525.36 → 2530.58] He's been taking school, and he's pretty close to the end of that now, so we need to make
[2530.58 → 2532.10] some decisions there.
[2532.10 → 2537.18] So our Council will be, and admin Council will be hosting a roundtable evening sometime
[2537.18 → 2542.98] in the next few months, and so you'll hear more about that to discuss and discern there.
[2542.98 → 2549.38] We also had a draft update of our budget from last year versus our giving, and we're very
[2549.38 → 2553.64] happy to be in a surplus position.
[2553.64 → 2555.34] We exceeded our expenses last year.
[2555.34 → 2560.34] We didn't quite meet the budget amount, but we did exceed our expenses, and we have a surplus.
[2560.34 → 2565.00] In addition, with a lot of rental income the church received last year, we're in a good
[2565.00 → 2565.42] financial position.
[2565.42 → 2570.56] So the decision is how to use that money need to be made, and we're very thankful and blessed
[2570.56 → 2572.22] to be in this position.
[2572.22 → 2576.88] And thankful to the congregation for all your faithful giving last year.
[2576.88 → 2581.88] We also had a brief discussion about the future of the church library, so we would like to
[2581.88 → 2584.88] have a volunteer step up again to run that library.
[2584.88 → 2591.54] So if anyone feels they can be called to that position, come see a Council member.
[2591.54 → 2596.54] And we selected delegates for classes, so we had lots of people volunteering for that.
[2596.54 → 2601.54] And we had an update from Pastor Chris, Kevin, and Josh.
[2601.54 → 2604.20] And that was what we discussed on Tuesday.
[2604.20 → 2606.20] Thanks, and I'll add it to Kevin.
[2606.20 → 2607.20] Or, not to Kevin.
[2607.20 → 2608.20] Ken.
[2608.20 → 2609.20] Ken.
[2609.20 → 2611.20] My name is Ken, not Kevin.
[2611.20 → 2614.20] And yeah, I'll be leading us in prayer this morning.
[2614.20 → 2619.36] And before we pray, I just want to mention to that next week Sunday we will be partaking
[2619.36 → 2622.58] in communion, having Lord's Supper together.
[2622.58 → 2629.88] And so whether we're in times of joy or times of hurting or wherever we're at, we're called
[2629.88 → 2633.14] to gather together and participate together.
[2633.38 → 2637.04] Even if we have a basket on our head and garland, you're welcome around this table.
[2637.04 → 2639.00] And we look forward to that.
[2639.14 → 2642.32] So take time this week to prayerfully prepare for that.
[2643.46 → 2645.20] So now, yeah, let's gather together.
[2645.32 → 2648.38] For those of us here, let's lift our hearts together.
[2648.38 → 2653.32] And to those of us online who are worshipping with us as well as one body, let's lift
[2653.32 → 2655.86] our voices to God and reach out in prayer.
[2657.86 → 2661.56] Lord, our God, we exalt you and praise your name.
[2662.32 → 2666.68] For in perfect faithfulness, you have done wonderful things, things planned long ago.
[2667.80 → 2672.76] We know that you, Lord, our God, you are faithful, keeping your covenant love to a thousand
[2672.76 → 2675.86] generations of those who love you and keep your commandments.
[2676.80 → 2678.28] Great is your faithfulness, Lord.
[2678.38 → 2684.64] When we stop and reflect on your goodness and faithfulness and take time to count our blessings,
[2685.18 → 2686.98] we see your hand at work everywhere.
[2686.98 → 2692.94] In this church community, some of us are celebrating restored health, new faith, new
[2692.94 → 2694.30] children, answers to prayer.
[2694.96 → 2699.58] We praise you, Lord, for all the blessings you have poured out on us and for your unfailing
[2699.58 → 2701.08] love and hope in Jesus.
[2702.36 → 2706.72] We rejoice with the howling as they receive their new son, Jed Wolf Howling, last week.
[2706.72 → 2713.06] Bless and guide parents to help us raise children who know your ways and trust and follow you.
[2713.90 → 2716.18] You alone, Lord, are worthy of our praise.
[2717.18 → 2723.74] We also turn to those, we also turn to you, those who are carrying burdens, and we carry
[2723.74 → 2724.66] them to you together.
[2724.66 → 2737.52] We confess, Lord, that there are times, too, when we don't see the whole picture, and we struggle to find your will in hard times.
[2737.96 → 2740.08] But we know and confess that you are faithful.
[2740.08 → 2752.34] When we are seeking your will, help us to remember to rejoice always, to pray continually, and to give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for us in Christ Jesus.
[2753.54 → 2757.30] Lord, we lift those who are in times of sickness and mourning.
[2758.06 → 2764.54] Lord, we pray for the Vanderweel family, as Tony Vanderweel, a past member of this church, passed away last Sunday.
[2764.54 → 2769.96] Lord, we ask for your blessing on their family and your comfort in their time of mourning.
[2770.82 → 2782.04] And Lord, as his funeral is coming up on February 10th at Fleetwood, Lord, we pray for that to be a time of celebration of the life you've given to him and to each of us.
[2783.58 → 2790.94] And Lord, we also pray for Arnie Ellison from M2W2, as he's presently hospitalized with a brain tumour.
[2790.94 → 2795.28] Lord, we ask for your healing and for your grace on Arnie and his family.
[2796.60 → 2803.74] And Lord, we pray for all of those who are struggling with various struggles at this time.
[2804.40 → 2811.76] Lord, we pray for Elise Wagoner's dad, Doug Tendon, as he has just completed radiation and he's continuing on with chemotherapy.
[2811.76 → 2821.16] Lord, we ask for your healing hand on the treatments, that the results from the PET scan next Saturday would show the radiation was effective on the spinal tumour.
[2822.14 → 2829.94] Lord, we pray for Doug, that your spirit would encourage him as he adjusts to partial paralysis when he's so used to being physically fit and active.
[2830.52 → 2837.02] We pray for Doug's wife, Jerry, and for Aaron, Elise, Tits, and Marek, as they walk this difficult journey with Doug.
[2837.02 → 2844.92] Lord, some of us are battling depression, especially those dark winter months that we're in.
[2845.16 → 2847.10] And Lord, we pray for comfort and hope.
[2847.76 → 2852.16] Please lift us up out of the pit and settle our feet on Christ, the solid rock.
[2853.12 → 2859.22] And Lord, we pray for those of us who are struggling deeply with addictions and family and friends who are impacted by these addictions.
[2859.86 → 2864.36] We ask for you to guide those battling addictions to get the help they need to recover.
[2864.36 → 2870.54] We also pray for those who are shut in and unable to get out of their homes due to aging and ailments.
[2871.28 → 2875.56] Help us to be a unified, connected body, even when we are not gathered together, Lord.
[2875.98 → 2879.62] Each one of us here has cares on our hearts, and we need you.
[2880.58 → 2883.36] Lord, draw us to you as you call us, saying,
[2883.60 → 2886.96] Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
[2886.96 → 2896.02] Lord, we also pray for Tanya Tastemaker, as she is struggling deeply with pain from the cancer in her body and the medications that she's taking to stop the cancer.
[2896.78 → 2905.64] Lord, we pray for healing for Tanya and strength for the family, Claus, Amanda, and me, and the kids, and her sister Jocelyn, as we navigate this difficult journey.
[2905.64 → 2914.32] We pray for peace and assurance to know that it is well with my soul, even when it is not well with our bodies due to sickness or disease.
[2915.44 → 2920.46] Lord, you are our only comfort, our hope and comfort in life and in death.
[2921.20 → 2926.30] Help us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful.
[2926.30 → 2935.56] We pray for your grace to flood over our world and bring peace to us in places of war, political divisions, hunger, and devastation.
[2936.32 → 2944.06] We pray for those affected by the fires in California and elsewhere, Lord, and we pray for your grace in each of their lives.
[2944.90 → 2949.06] We pray for those who are impacted by the economic actions between countries.
[2949.84 → 2952.22] Help us follow your call to be good neighbours.
[2952.22 → 2962.86] Lord, we pray that you will use your church to be your hands and feet and bring healing and bring the gospel to a world so desperately in need of your salvation, Jesus.
[2963.72 → 2967.00] And as you speak to us this morning through the words of Pastor Sean,
[2967.26 → 2971.04] please open our hearts to see you and our ears to hear you.
[2971.38 → 2975.72] And help us not merely listen to the word, Lord, but help us to do what it says.
[2976.50 → 2979.76] We pray all this in the name of our Saviour, Jesus. Amen.
[2982.22 → 2999.40] Good morning once again.
[3000.08 → 3005.16] My name is Sean, and I'm from New Life CRC in Abbotsford.
[3005.16 → 3010.34] Just to give you a bit of an introduction, I have a wife.
[3010.62 → 3014.68] Her name is Ashley, and our son, KaiOS, is almost four.
[3015.18 → 3021.46] And they wanted to be here with me this morning, but I wasn't sure how the road conditions would be with the snow and everything.
[3021.60 → 3027.24] So I left early, which meant trying to get a toddler at four years, almost four years old,
[3027.94 → 3031.70] earlier on time is next to impossible early morning.
[3031.70 → 3035.66] So those of you who have young children know what I mean.
[3035.96 → 3040.48] But so sadly, it's just me that's here tonight, to this morning, and I'm glad to be here.
[3042.72 → 3047.74] I got to know Pastor Chris a little better because we went to Synod together last year.
[3047.90 → 3051.04] Before that, I knew of him, but I never got to meet him or talk to him.
[3051.38 → 3053.42] But going to Synod, we drove together.
[3053.58 → 3057.86] I met him at his house, and we drove to the airport on our way to Synod.
[3057.86 → 3064.28] And interestingly, that day, there were some major accidents on the bridge and through the tunnel.
[3064.60 → 3068.46] And so the Google Maps just took us like the most roundabout way to get to YVR.
[3068.76 → 3075.14] And it took us almost like two hours to get to the airport, which made for lots of good conversations and getting to know one another really well.
[3075.60 → 3078.98] So it was a good time just getting to know Pastor Chris.
[3078.98 → 3084.24] And it was also very assuring for me being a first-time delegate to Synod.
[3085.30 → 3087.92] And I think he's been there three or four times.
[3088.26 → 3096.82] And to sit at the same table with someone who's that experienced and who's quite keen on church polity and church order, if you know him,
[3097.24 → 3103.68] is very assuring for someone like me who's also keen in church order and polity, but first-time delegate at Synod.
[3103.68 → 3113.96] And so all that to say, yeah, I love Pastor Chris, and I'm glad to be here with you to lead you in worship and to share God's Word with you.
[3115.96 → 3121.12] Now, to share with you a little bit of a secret, lately it's been my practice.
[3121.68 → 3125.02] As I write the introduction of each sermon to ask myself the question,
[3126.36 → 3128.62] why should we pay attention to this message?
[3128.62 → 3132.60] Why should we pay attention to this passage?
[3133.78 → 3138.48] Why is it important that I, the preacher, and the congregation hear this message?
[3140.04 → 3142.58] I've asked the same question as I wrote this sermon also.
[3142.74 → 3147.18] Why should we, you, the congregation of Langley Emanuel CRC, and I,
[3147.60 → 3154.64] pay attention to this passage that Paul wrote to some people living in some ancient city almost 2,000 years ago?
[3154.64 → 3163.52] I believe we should pay attention to this passage because it teaches us how we as Christians should face persecutions
[3163.52 → 3166.80] when it comes to us because of our faith in Jesus Christ.
[3167.62 → 3172.12] As Paul bears his heart out for the believers in this ancient city of Thessalonica,
[3172.48 → 3174.80] which still exists today, by the way, in Greece,
[3175.56 → 3179.38] we're also taught how to face the trials that challenge our faith in the present
[3179.38 → 3183.42] as we wait for Jesus' future but imminent return.
[3184.64 → 3186.22] So let's read the passage together.
[3186.66 → 3192.50] Our passage today is from 1 Thessalonians 2, verses 17 to 3, verse 5.
[3193.56 → 3197.12] I'll be reading from the NIV, and the words will be up on the screen behind me.
[3197.12 → 3204.90] But brothers and sisters, when we were orphaned by being separated from you for a short time,
[3205.00 → 3206.40] in person, not in thought,
[3207.40 → 3210.94] out of our intense longing we made every effort to see you.
[3211.70 → 3215.36] For we wanted to come to you, certainly I, Paul, did again and again,
[3215.82 → 3217.28] but Satan blocked our way.
[3217.28 → 3224.54] For what is our hope, our joy, or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when He comes?
[3225.32 → 3226.14] Is it not you?
[3226.98 → 3229.20] Indeed, you are our glory and joy.
[3229.92 → 3234.56] So when we could stand no longer, we thought it's best to be left by ourselves in Athens.
[3235.46 → 3238.84] We sent Timothy, who is our brother and co-worker in God's service,
[3239.20 → 3240.72] in spreading the gospel of Christ,
[3240.72 → 3243.58] to strengthen and encourage you in your faith,
[3244.22 → 3247.12] so that no one would be unsettled by these trials.
[3248.26 → 3251.90] For you know quite well that we are destined for them.
[3252.76 → 3256.40] In fact, when we were with you, we kept telling you that we would be persecuted,
[3257.04 → 3259.26] and it turned out that way, as you well know.
[3260.40 → 3263.60] For this reason, when I could stand no longer,
[3263.78 → 3265.38] when I could stand no longer,
[3265.88 → 3267.76] I sent to find out about your faith.
[3267.76 → 3271.80] I was afraid that in some way the tempter had tempted you,
[3272.10 → 3274.64] and that our labours might have been in vain.
[3276.66 → 3278.14] Let's pray once again.
[3281.40 → 3282.86] Spirit of the living God,
[3283.68 → 3289.94] we ask that you would accomplish what you have purposed,
[3290.78 → 3293.60] your word to accomplish this morning.
[3294.46 → 3296.02] May it not return to your empty.
[3297.76 → 3300.90] As your word is being proclaimed in this place.
[3303.52 → 3305.86] Illuminate these words into our minds and our hearts.
[3306.64 → 3307.54] Help us understand.
[3308.20 → 3308.84] Teach us.
[3309.80 → 3313.48] And empower us to live in obedience to your word.
[3314.22 → 3314.98] In Jesus' name.
[3315.58 → 3315.82] Amen.
[3315.82 → 3320.90] Now, in chapter 2, verse 17,
[3321.08 → 3324.02] we read that Paul was separated from them in person.
[3324.82 → 3327.44] The reason for this is found in the story of Acts 17,
[3327.60 → 3330.32] where Paul and Silas were in Thessalonica,
[3330.88 → 3333.50] discussing with the Jews over three Sabbath days,
[3333.64 → 3334.52] over three weeks,
[3335.06 → 3337.80] and proving to them that Jesus is indeed the Messiah.
[3337.80 → 3342.22] Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas,
[3342.64 → 3347.64] along with a great number of the devout Gentiles and women of high standing in the city.
[3348.98 → 3350.96] Some Jews got jealous of this,
[3351.02 → 3352.34] so they stirred up a riot,
[3352.94 → 3353.82] forming a mob,
[3354.14 → 3355.26] and attacked Jason,
[3355.44 → 3357.46] whom they thought was hiding Paul and Silas.
[3358.26 → 3359.52] The mob couldn't find them,
[3359.52 → 3361.62] so they dragged Jason out of his house,
[3361.68 → 3362.92] along with other believers,
[3363.50 → 3365.94] and accused them before the city authorities,
[3366.14 → 3369.30] saying that Jason had received Paul and Silas,
[3369.66 → 3372.58] who have caused great trouble all over the world.
[3373.12 → 3373.72] In their words,
[3373.74 → 3376.22] who have turned this world upside down,
[3377.22 → 3378.78] and have now come to the city,
[3378.94 → 3382.12] leading people to go against Caesar's decrees,
[3382.12 → 3385.66] by saying that there is another king named Jesus.
[3387.08 → 3388.70] The city authorities were disturbed
[3388.70 → 3389.48] by this,
[3389.52 → 3391.36] so they punished Jason and the other believers
[3391.36 → 3392.84] by charging them a fine,
[3393.36 → 3395.56] and let them all go.
[3396.94 → 3398.52] It was because of this ordeal
[3398.52 → 3402.18] that Paul and Silas had to leave Thessalonica at night.
[3404.24 → 3406.12] It is with this as the backdrop
[3406.12 → 3408.86] where Paul's pastoral heart for the Thessalonians
[3408.86 → 3411.68] is shown in this passage that we've just read.
[3413.20 → 3415.46] Many of the converts to whom Paul was writing
[3415.46 → 3416.46] were new converts,
[3416.90 → 3418.68] because it wasn't long after they joined Paul
[3418.68 → 3420.84] and Silas that persecution broke out,
[3421.10 → 3423.04] and they were forced to leave the city.
[3424.64 → 3427.04] This is why Paul says that he was orphaned
[3427.04 → 3429.66] by being separated from them in verse 17.
[3430.38 → 3431.92] Now, unlike our modern usage,
[3432.04 → 3434.02] the Greek word used here
[3434.02 → 3436.88] could either refer to the child
[3436.88 → 3439.02] who has lost his or her parents,
[3439.42 → 3442.98] or the parents who were bereft of their child.
[3442.98 → 3447.50] So in this case, Paul is using it in the latter sense,
[3447.72 → 3450.02] where he feels as though he and Silas
[3450.02 → 3451.42] were separated from them,
[3451.46 → 3454.02] like parents forced to separate
[3454.02 → 3455.18] from their own children.
[3456.92 → 3458.22] Now, from the rest of the letter,
[3458.34 → 3459.66] Paul clearly thought of himself
[3459.66 → 3461.18] as their spiritual parent.
[3461.72 → 3464.08] In the preceding section just before our passage,
[3464.18 → 3464.54] he writes,
[3464.54 → 3467.50] just as a nursing mother cares for her children,
[3467.96 → 3469.26] so we cared for you.
[3469.98 → 3472.06] Because we loved you so much,
[3472.82 → 3474.60] we were delighted to share with you
[3474.60 → 3476.12] not only the gospel of God,
[3476.18 → 3477.62] but our lives as well.
[3478.68 → 3480.50] Also in 2, verse 11, he wrote,
[3480.76 → 3482.04] we dealt with each of you
[3482.04 → 3484.76] as a father deals with his own children,
[3485.14 → 3486.68] encouraging, comforting,
[3487.02 → 3489.90] and urging you to live lives worthy of God.
[3489.90 → 3493.84] Paul loved and cared for them
[3493.84 → 3496.48] as a parent loves his or her children.
[3498.14 → 3499.64] This is why it was so painful
[3499.64 → 3502.98] for Paul to be torn away from them,
[3503.26 → 3505.24] which made his longing to be with them
[3505.24 → 3508.08] in person all the more intense.
[3510.20 → 3512.58] This is also why Paul writes
[3512.58 → 3515.36] that although they're separated from him in person,
[3515.96 → 3518.62] they're not separated from him in thought.
[3518.62 → 3520.68] In other words, for Paul,
[3520.76 → 3521.96] the believers in Thessalonica
[3521.96 → 3523.76] may be out of his sight,
[3524.12 → 3525.34] absent from him physically,
[3525.94 → 3527.68] but not out of his mind.
[3529.18 → 3531.04] Aside from the forced separation,
[3532.04 → 3534.18] another reason why they were not out of his mind
[3534.18 → 3535.46] was because of the trials
[3535.46 → 3536.88] that they were experiencing.
[3537.08 → 3537.66] What trials?
[3539.46 → 3541.66] Given the circumstance of Paul and Silas'
[3541.82 → 3543.46] forced departure from Thessalonica,
[3543.90 → 3545.18] it is not unlikely
[3545.18 → 3547.44] that the believers in Thessalonica
[3547.44 → 3548.64] experienced the same,
[3548.78 → 3550.86] if not a similar kind of persecution
[3550.86 → 3552.12] in the city.
[3553.32 → 3555.40] Because the new converts following Jesus
[3555.40 → 3556.56] as their new king
[3556.56 → 3559.44] would have been seen as public enemies,
[3559.82 → 3562.26] those who disturbed the peace in the city
[3562.26 → 3564.94] as agitators of the status quo.
[3565.94 → 3566.84] Here's why.
[3566.84 → 3570.98] The city of Thessalonica
[3570.98 → 3573.50] was loyal to Caesar
[3573.50 → 3575.96] and showed its loyalty
[3575.96 → 3579.34] through the imperial cult,
[3580.18 → 3581.78] the worship of the emperor.
[3582.90 → 3584.58] This in turn allowed the city
[3584.58 → 3586.66] and its people to enjoy favour from Rome.
[3587.48 → 3588.60] And for this reason,
[3588.72 → 3590.66] it was crucial that they maintain
[3590.66 → 3592.26] good connection to Caesar
[3592.26 → 3595.06] so that they can continue to enjoy favour,
[3595.06 → 3598.48] which directly tied to their prosperity
[3598.48 → 3599.22] as a city.
[3600.82 → 3601.26] Therefore,
[3601.96 → 3603.82] to have a movement of people
[3603.82 → 3604.70] declaring Jesus
[3604.70 → 3606.36] as their Lord and Saviour
[3606.36 → 3607.80] was a problem.
[3609.26 → 3610.14] And it needed
[3610.14 → 3611.74] to be stomped out quickly
[3611.74 → 3613.70] to show the city's
[3613.70 → 3615.60] unwavering allegiance to Caesar.
[3615.60 → 3618.30] This is why the accusation
[3618.30 → 3619.56] against Paul and Silas
[3619.56 → 3620.52] along with Jason
[3620.52 → 3621.44] and the other believers
[3621.44 → 3623.32] disturbed the city authorities
[3623.32 → 3624.42] because they were accused
[3624.42 → 3626.24] of acting against
[3626.24 → 3627.66] the decrees of Caesar.
[3630.78 → 3631.42] Thus,
[3631.50 → 3632.10] the persecutions
[3632.10 → 3632.72] that the believers
[3632.72 → 3634.04] in Thessalonica faced
[3634.04 → 3636.42] may have affected them financially.
[3636.90 → 3638.10] Just like we see
[3638.10 → 3639.48] in Acts chapter 17
[3639.48 → 3640.84] where Jason is fined
[3640.84 → 3642.24] as a persecution
[3642.24 → 3643.72] or as punishment
[3643.72 → 3645.30] or socially
[3645.30 → 3647.06] being seen as those
[3647.06 → 3647.78] who are against
[3647.78 → 3648.86] the common good
[3648.86 → 3649.96] of the city and its people.
[3651.02 → 3651.70] In other words,
[3652.72 → 3653.58] Christians were viewed
[3653.58 → 3654.48] as obstacles
[3654.48 → 3655.86] to the flourishing
[3655.86 → 3656.78] of the city
[3656.78 → 3658.04] and the people
[3658.04 → 3659.28] of Thessalonica,
[3660.30 → 3661.54] thus needing
[3661.54 → 3662.80] to be silenced
[3662.80 → 3664.18] and punished
[3664.18 → 3665.50] if necessary
[3665.50 → 3667.34] for the common good
[3667.34 → 3668.52] of Thessalonica.
[3668.52 → 3675.16] We also
[3675.16 → 3677.48] live in a cultural climate
[3677.48 → 3678.74] that's not too far
[3678.74 → 3680.34] from the situation
[3680.34 → 3680.94] that the believers
[3680.94 → 3681.80] in Thessalonica
[3681.80 → 3683.04] have found themselves in.
[3684.28 → 3685.16] In his book,
[3685.42 → 3686.40] Live No Lies,
[3687.08 → 3687.90] John Markova writes
[3687.90 → 3689.06] that followers of Jesus
[3689.06 → 3690.30] are currently living
[3690.30 → 3691.44] through what he calls
[3691.44 → 3693.18] the three tectonic shifts
[3693.18 → 3694.22] in Western culture.
[3695.36 → 3696.08] The first shift
[3696.08 → 3697.34] is the movement
[3697.34 → 3698.08] from majority
[3698.08 → 3698.90] to minority.
[3699.90 → 3700.68] Although certainly
[3700.68 → 3701.46] not a minority
[3701.46 → 3702.06] in number,
[3702.72 → 3703.30] Christians are now
[3703.30 → 3704.06] considered to be
[3704.06 → 3705.04] what the sociologists
[3705.04 → 3706.96] call a cognitive minority.
[3708.20 → 3709.44] In today's society,
[3709.56 → 3710.34] Christian worldview
[3710.34 → 3711.40] and its value systems
[3711.40 → 3712.34] are increasingly
[3712.34 → 3713.06] at odds
[3713.06 → 3714.02] with the culture's
[3714.02 → 3714.50] practices
[3714.50 → 3715.90] and social norms.
[3717.12 → 3717.80] Christians today
[3717.80 → 3719.36] face constant pressure
[3719.36 → 3720.54] to assimilate
[3720.54 → 3721.32] and follow
[3721.32 → 3722.42] the rest of society
[3722.42 → 3723.54] much like the believers
[3723.54 → 3724.36] in Thessalonica
[3724.36 → 3725.60] who face pressures
[3725.60 → 3726.36] to assimilate
[3726.36 → 3727.30] and to conform
[3727.30 → 3728.36] to worshipping Caesar.
[3730.50 → 3731.62] The second
[3731.62 → 3732.54] tectonic shift
[3732.54 → 3733.96] is the movement
[3733.96 → 3735.94] from a place of honour
[3735.94 → 3737.96] to a place of shame.
[3739.56 → 3740.36] Christian faith
[3740.36 → 3741.88] no longer has a place
[3741.88 → 3742.38] of honour
[3742.38 → 3743.62] in the public square.
[3744.64 → 3745.60] With society's
[3745.60 → 3746.42] radical reversal
[3746.42 → 3747.10] around issues
[3747.10 → 3748.04] like human sexuality,
[3748.74 → 3749.06] gender,
[3749.56 → 3750.72] and life of the unborn,
[3750.90 → 3751.72] followers of Jesus
[3751.72 → 3752.64] are now seen
[3752.64 → 3753.94] as part of the problem.
[3754.36 → 3756.24] not as the solution.
[3757.68 → 3759.06] The biblical vision
[3759.06 → 3759.98] of human sexuality
[3759.98 → 3761.40] is taken as simply wrong
[3761.40 → 3762.86] and irrelevant
[3762.86 → 3765.14] by a large number
[3765.14 → 3766.22] of population.
[3767.06 → 3767.88] Because of this,
[3768.92 → 3769.94] Christians and their values
[3769.94 → 3770.96] are no longer held
[3770.96 → 3771.78] in high esteem
[3771.78 → 3772.58] in the public square,
[3773.58 → 3774.50] but as something
[3774.50 → 3775.56] to hide
[3775.56 → 3777.28] and to be ashamed of.
[3777.28 → 3781.14] So first movement,
[3781.88 → 3782.78] majority to minority,
[3783.36 → 3784.00] second movement,
[3784.16 → 3785.14] from a place of honour
[3785.14 → 3786.24] to a place of shame.
[3786.96 → 3788.08] Now the third shift
[3788.08 → 3789.20] is the movement
[3789.20 → 3790.84] from widespread tolerance
[3790.84 → 3793.32] to rising hostility,
[3793.96 → 3794.78] where Christians
[3794.78 → 3795.74] are now increasingly
[3795.74 → 3798.28] thought of as dangerous.
[3798.28 → 3801.32] the teachings of Jesus
[3801.32 → 3802.40] is now seen
[3802.40 → 3803.20] as a threat
[3803.20 → 3805.02] to secularism's
[3805.02 → 3805.90] alternative vision
[3805.90 → 3806.90] of human flourishing.
[3807.84 → 3808.74] While in the past,
[3808.84 → 3809.62] Christians were regarded
[3809.62 → 3811.00] as weird,
[3811.26 → 3812.16] but good people,
[3813.16 → 3814.92] today in Western society,
[3814.98 → 3815.68] Christians are regarded
[3815.68 → 3816.48] as bigots,
[3817.18 → 3817.46] haters,
[3817.90 → 3818.96] and homophobes.
[3818.96 → 3823.20] What are we to do
[3823.20 → 3824.62] in this cultural climate?
[3826.70 → 3828.24] How does our passage
[3828.24 → 3829.20] today
[3829.20 → 3831.44] teach us to live
[3831.44 → 3832.38] in this present
[3832.38 → 3833.22] cultural moment
[3833.22 → 3834.56] as we wait
[3834.56 → 3835.94] for Christ's return?
[3838.82 → 3839.42] First,
[3840.28 → 3842.38] it teaches us
[3842.38 → 3844.84] to live with the acceptance
[3844.84 → 3846.84] that Christians
[3846.84 → 3847.90] are destined
[3847.90 → 3849.32] for trials,
[3850.02 → 3850.68] we're destined
[3850.68 → 3851.58] for trials,
[3851.66 → 3852.44] as Paul reminded
[3852.44 → 3853.32] the Thessalonians.
[3854.38 → 3855.28] The believers
[3855.28 → 3856.00] in Thessalonica
[3856.00 → 3856.86] have seen Paul
[3856.86 → 3857.50] and Silas
[3857.50 → 3858.54] and their fellow believers
[3858.54 → 3859.40] face persecution,
[3859.94 → 3861.18] and they were told
[3861.18 → 3861.62] by Paul
[3861.62 → 3862.48] that they themselves
[3862.48 → 3863.24] would also
[3863.24 → 3864.30] experience persecution.
[3865.28 → 3865.86] And indeed,
[3866.02 → 3866.98] it has turned out
[3866.98 → 3867.40] that way,
[3867.56 → 3868.08] as Paul says
[3868.08 → 3868.66] in verse 4
[3868.66 → 3869.30] of chapter 3.
[3871.18 → 3871.70] Suffering
[3871.70 → 3872.92] and facing opposition
[3872.92 → 3874.12] for our faith
[3874.12 → 3875.62] is not unusual
[3875.62 → 3876.42] for followers
[3876.42 → 3877.00] of Jesus.
[3877.90 → 3878.74] After all,
[3878.86 → 3880.10] Jesus himself suffered,
[3880.70 → 3882.12] being falsely accused,
[3882.72 → 3883.16] shamed,
[3883.80 → 3884.40] beaten up,
[3884.90 → 3885.78] eventually nailed
[3885.78 → 3886.46] and impaled
[3886.46 → 3887.30] on a cross.
[3888.30 → 3889.68] He told his disciples
[3889.68 → 3890.26] that suffering
[3890.26 → 3891.00] is inevitable
[3891.00 → 3892.66] for his followers.
[3893.46 → 3894.12] He says in John
[3894.12 → 3894.78] chapter 15,
[3894.86 → 3895.98] if the world hates you,
[3896.36 → 3896.92] keep in mind
[3896.92 → 3898.32] that it hated me first.
[3899.28 → 3900.50] Remember what I told you,
[3900.70 → 3902.06] a servant is not greater
[3902.06 → 3902.82] than his master.
[3903.14 → 3904.42] If they persecuted me,
[3905.02 → 3906.52] they will persecute you also.
[3906.52 → 3911.32] For Christians,
[3912.52 → 3913.70] suffering persecution
[3913.70 → 3916.24] is part of the call
[3916.24 → 3917.88] to taking up the cross
[3917.88 → 3920.22] and following after Jesus.
[3923.64 → 3924.76] Persecution was not new
[3924.76 → 3925.72] for the followers of Jesus
[3925.72 → 3926.42] throughout history,
[3926.92 → 3928.06] and it certainly isn't new
[3928.06 → 3928.70] for us today.
[3929.68 → 3930.60] We see this
[3930.60 → 3931.78] in the letters of Paul
[3931.78 → 3933.02] as well as in 1 Peter
[3933.02 → 3933.52] where he says,
[3933.52 → 3934.34] Dear friends,
[3935.20 → 3936.56] do not be surprised
[3936.56 → 3938.34] at the fiery ordeal
[3938.34 → 3939.76] that has come on you
[3939.76 → 3940.94] to test you,
[3941.58 → 3942.90] as though something strange
[3942.90 → 3943.80] were happening to you.
[3946.04 → 3947.22] Don't be surprised
[3947.22 → 3948.14] by persecutions,
[3948.28 → 3948.80] Peter says.
[3949.72 → 3950.92] So what are we to do
[3950.92 → 3951.88] when faced with trials?
[3953.58 → 3954.52] Peter continues,
[3955.52 → 3956.22] Rejoice.
[3957.30 → 3958.72] Rejoice in as much
[3958.72 → 3959.68] as you participate
[3959.68 → 3961.66] in the sufferings of Christ.
[3961.66 → 3963.68] Rejoice because you're suffering.
[3964.06 → 3964.94] By your suffering,
[3965.04 → 3965.66] you're participating
[3965.66 → 3967.66] in the sufferings of Christ.
[3967.76 → 3968.88] You are joining in
[3968.88 → 3969.78] with Christ
[3969.78 → 3970.98] in his suffering.
[3971.60 → 3972.20] Rejoice.
[3974.78 → 3976.02] We are to rejoice
[3976.02 → 3976.98] in our trials.
[3977.80 → 3978.36] We rejoice
[3978.36 → 3979.30] because we're participating
[3979.30 → 3980.64] in Christ's suffering.
[3980.98 → 3982.08] Like those who have gone
[3982.08 → 3982.82] before us,
[3982.90 → 3983.44] we rejoice
[3983.44 → 3984.68] knowing that we're being
[3984.68 → 3985.62] counted worthy
[3985.62 → 3986.28] of suffering
[3986.28 → 3987.26] for Christ's name.
[3987.72 → 3988.52] We rejoice
[3988.52 → 3989.28] in our suffering
[3989.28 → 3990.62] because if we share
[3990.62 → 3991.36] in his suffering,
[3991.36 → 3992.92] we will also share
[3992.92 → 3993.84] in his glory
[3993.84 → 3994.68] when he returns.
[3995.78 → 3996.10] Furthermore,
[3996.34 → 3996.96] we rejoice
[3996.96 → 3998.28] knowing that when we suffer
[3998.28 → 3999.22] for Christ's sake,
[3999.52 → 4000.82] his return is near.
[4001.66 → 4002.64] As Jesus says
[4002.64 → 4003.78] in Matthew chapter 24,
[4004.22 → 4004.80] he says this,
[4004.96 → 4006.26] Then you will be handed over
[4006.26 → 4007.08] to be persecuted
[4007.08 → 4008.30] and put to death.
[4009.36 → 4010.54] And you will be hated
[4010.54 → 4011.42] by all nations
[4011.42 → 4012.20] because of me.
[4012.96 → 4013.56] But the one
[4013.56 → 4014.30] who stands firm
[4014.30 → 4014.78] to the end
[4014.78 → 4015.98] will be saved.
[4016.42 → 4017.22] And this gospel
[4017.22 → 4017.82] of the kingdom
[4017.82 → 4018.60] will be preached
[4018.60 → 4019.46] in the whole world
[4019.46 → 4020.16] as a testimony
[4020.16 → 4021.78] to all the nations.
[4021.78 → 4022.86] And then,
[4023.26 → 4024.88] the end will come.
[4027.64 → 4029.10] As such,
[4030.16 → 4031.12] Christian suffering
[4031.12 → 4032.54] has always
[4032.54 → 4034.30] had
[4034.30 → 4035.68] an eschatological
[4035.68 → 4036.60] perspective.
[4036.60 → 4039.30] We know that
[4039.30 → 4040.44] when suffering comes,
[4041.42 → 4042.20] we're reminded
[4042.20 → 4043.82] that his return
[4043.82 → 4045.16] is near
[4045.16 → 4046.70] as we wait
[4046.70 → 4048.34] for his return
[4048.34 → 4049.38] and share
[4049.38 → 4050.18] in his suffering.
[4055.28 → 4056.50] Not only that,
[4057.44 → 4058.42] we rejoice
[4058.42 → 4060.00] knowing that suffering
[4060.00 → 4061.82] produces perseverance.
[4062.92 → 4063.60] Perseverance,
[4063.92 → 4064.26] character,
[4064.26 → 4065.60] and character,
[4066.32 → 4066.62] hope.
[4067.72 → 4068.44] And no matter
[4068.44 → 4069.24] how much our faith
[4069.24 → 4070.08] may bring shame
[4070.08 → 4072.00] to us in the public square,
[4072.58 → 4073.40] in the grand scheme
[4073.40 → 4073.92] of things,
[4074.92 → 4075.64] the hope produced
[4075.64 → 4076.38] by suffering
[4076.38 → 4078.00] for and with Christ
[4078.00 → 4078.78] will never,
[4079.32 → 4080.04] never put us
[4080.04 → 4080.54] to shame
[4080.54 → 4082.44] because Jesus Christ
[4082.44 → 4083.70] who suffered
[4083.70 → 4085.02] has also
[4085.02 → 4086.40] overcome the world.
[4086.88 → 4087.20] Hallelujah.
[4089.54 → 4090.66] Can I get an amen?
[4090.66 → 4090.86] Amen.
[4090.86 → 4090.90] Amen.
[4090.90 → 4090.94] Amen.
[4090.94 → 4091.50] Amen.
[4091.50 → 4091.74] Amen.
[4091.74 → 4091.94] Amen.
[4091.94 → 4091.98] Amen.
[4094.64 → 4095.12] Personally,
[4096.74 → 4097.88] it teaches us
[4097.88 → 4098.80] to live
[4098.80 → 4100.22] with the assurance
[4100.22 → 4101.56] that we're not alone
[4101.56 → 4102.34] when we are faced
[4102.34 → 4103.54] with persecutions.
[4105.62 → 4106.52] We know that
[4106.52 → 4107.10] the circumstance
[4107.10 → 4107.86] that the Thessalonians
[4107.86 → 4108.74] found themselves in
[4108.74 → 4109.48] after putting
[4109.48 → 4110.54] their faith in Jesus
[4110.54 → 4111.74] was not
[4111.74 → 4113.04] a favourable one.
[4114.38 → 4115.00] We know this
[4115.00 → 4115.38] to be true
[4115.38 → 4116.14] because Paul writes
[4116.14 → 4116.76] in chapter 2,
[4116.82 → 4117.32] verse 14
[4117.32 → 4118.88] that the Thessalonian church
[4118.88 → 4119.98] became imitators
[4119.98 → 4121.00] of God's churches
[4121.00 → 4122.12] in Judea
[4122.12 → 4125.10] because they suffered from their own people.
[4126.02 → 4128.92] Paul writes that the Thessalonians suffered from their own people.
[4130.14 → 4134.28] The same kind of sufferings the churches in Judea received from the Jews.
[4136.32 → 4139.96] This is why Paul and Silas, out of their intense longing,
[4140.54 → 4142.58] made every effort to come see them.
[4143.42 → 4145.62] Their forced separation from the Thessalonian church
[4145.62 → 4148.30] not only intensified their longing to see them,
[4148.30 → 4151.64] it also intensified their concern for their new believers' faith,
[4151.64 → 4154.30] faith as they faced persecution.
[4157.06 → 4160.14] Paul and Silas worry that the believers in Thessalonica
[4160.14 → 4163.32] might be unsettled in their faith by these trials.
[4164.54 → 4168.38] Paul was also afraid that Satan may have tempted them from faith,
[4168.86 → 4170.76] thereby making their work be in vain.
[4172.40 → 4175.90] After all, Paul and Silas consider the believers in Thessalonica
[4175.90 → 4179.84] their hope, their joy, and the crown of glory.
[4179.84 → 4184.84] Much like loving parents whose pride and joy is their children.
[4188.50 → 4195.80] In writing this letter, Paul assures them that they are not alone in their trials.
[4196.64 → 4198.36] By the contents of the letter,
[4198.76 → 4203.28] we can see that Paul assures the Thessalonian church that they are not alone.
[4203.28 → 4208.44] From the start of the letter and the constant repetition of we throughout the letter,
[4208.94 → 4211.46] it is clear that it is not only Paul who is mindful of them,
[4211.54 → 4213.12] but also Silas and Timothy.
[4213.78 → 4216.62] All three of them pray for them continually.
[4217.16 → 4221.34] All three of them heard that the Thessalonian church suffered persecution from their own people.
[4221.34 → 4228.38] And for this reason, all three of them longed to be with them and have made every effort to see them.
[4228.92 → 4231.06] But when they could not return to Thessalonica,
[4231.50 → 4236.70] Paul and Silas sent Timothy to strengthen and encourage them in their faith
[4236.70 → 4242.32] so that none of them would be unsettled and tempted to turn away from their faith.
[4242.32 → 4250.54] This was Paul's assurance to the Thessalonian church that he has not abandoned them
[4250.54 → 4252.82] or has forgotten about them.
[4254.86 → 4260.46] Now the Greek word translated as unsettle in the NIV in verse 3 of chapter 3
[4260.46 → 4264.78] means to be moved from one place to another.
[4264.78 → 4271.14] Hence the English Standard Version translation writes moved
[4271.14 → 4274.50] so that you might not be moved by these trials.
[4276.18 → 4278.78] Paul and Silas' desire in sending Timothy
[4278.78 → 4282.54] is that they would be strengthened and encouraged in their faith
[4282.54 → 4285.78] so that the trials they were facing would not move them
[4285.78 → 4289.32] from following Christ back to following idols.
[4289.32 → 4294.84] Also the Greek word translated as tempt in the NIV
[4294.84 → 4298.36] and also in the ESV in 3 verse 5
[4298.36 → 4303.80] has the sense of being enticed, being lured into action.
[4306.12 → 4308.70] Paul was worried that Satan might use the persecution
[4308.70 → 4312.78] to entice the Thessalonian church to turn away from faith,
[4313.30 → 4315.58] thereby undoing the work of Paul and Silas
[4315.58 → 4317.94] in establishing the Thessalonian church.
[4319.32 → 4326.28] In the same way, the trials brought on by the three tectonic shifts in our culture,
[4326.82 → 4328.84] namely the shift from majority to minority,
[4329.42 → 4333.12] shift from honour to shame, shift from tolerance to hostility,
[4334.34 → 4342.06] these might unsettle us and tempt us to walk away from our faith
[4342.06 → 4346.60] instead of being steadfast as we wait for Jesus.
[4346.60 → 4350.82] The trials we face in our cultural moment,
[4351.06 → 4353.00] whether through shame or hostility,
[4353.56 → 4359.20] could move us from following Christ and His teachings
[4359.20 → 4364.64] to following an ideology or political party.
[4366.44 → 4371.28] We're faced with the constant pressure to conform to the way of cultural practices
[4371.28 → 4374.58] and social norms rather than the way of Jesus
[4374.58 → 4379.70] through social media, movies, and the shows we watch on various streaming platforms.
[4381.08 → 4385.24] Who thought peer pressure only lasts throughout middle school and high school?
[4385.24 → 4392.84] How easy it must be for Satan to entice us,
[4392.84 → 4398.28] to simply go with the flow of culture when we spend countless hours on our devices
[4398.28 → 4400.20] without much vigilance or resistance.
[4401.20 → 4403.98] All the while, the very Word of God that gives life
[4403.98 → 4407.98] sits on our desks or bookshelves collecting dust.
[4407.98 → 4414.54] Sadly, some Christians, much like the title of a book,
[4416.06 → 4417.30] amuse themselves to death.
[4422.44 → 4424.70] This is why it's important for us
[4424.70 → 4428.54] to be connected to our church community,
[4429.50 → 4433.48] especially as we face various trials of our time.
[4433.48 → 4438.68] God has given us people in our church like Paul,
[4439.22 → 4440.86] like Silas, and Timothy
[4440.86 → 4443.04] that remember us in prayer.
[4443.56 → 4444.78] People who not only pray,
[4444.88 → 4447.54] but also remind us of our identity in Christ
[4447.54 → 4450.32] and the awesome work that God has done in us.
[4450.44 → 4453.56] And that's not the job of only pastors or Christian leaders.
[4453.72 → 4456.30] That's the job of all of us as God's people.
[4457.10 → 4459.80] That's our accountability and responsibility to one another.
[4459.80 → 4466.04] People who instruct us to continue to live in a way
[4466.04 → 4467.92] that pleases God, to honour Him,
[4468.24 → 4471.50] by keeping us accountable to live lives that are holy unto God,
[4471.92 → 4473.06] faithful to Christ,
[4473.34 → 4477.04] and loving toward one another as we wait for our Lord's return.
[4478.64 → 4480.66] Just as God has used Paul and Silas
[4480.66 → 4483.44] to remind the Thessalonian church of who they are
[4483.44 → 4484.78] and how they are to live,
[4485.12 → 4487.48] God also uses people in our church,
[4488.08 → 4489.30] brothers and sisters in Christ,
[4489.30 → 4491.38] and co-workers in God's service
[4491.38 → 4493.22] to strengthen us
[4493.22 → 4496.24] and to encourage us when we face trials.
[4497.72 → 4500.40] This is why the writer of the book of Hebrews tells us,
[4500.50 → 4501.30] let us consider
[4501.30 → 4505.88] how we may spur one another on towards love and good deeds,
[4506.50 → 4509.44] not giving up on meeting together,
[4510.22 → 4512.00] as some are in the habit of doing,
[4512.68 → 4514.30] but encouraging one another,
[4514.30 → 4516.36] as we wait for the day of Christ's return.
[4516.36 → 4524.46] As we wait for the day of Christ's return,
[4525.42 → 4529.60] we're called to continue in gathering as God's people
[4529.60 → 4535.66] for mutual encouragement toward love and good deeds.
[4535.66 → 4540.64] And this is crucial for us as community,
[4540.86 → 4544.26] especially as we face trials in our own lives,
[4544.26 → 4546.66] in our current cultural moment.
[4546.66 → 4552.22] Now, in this sermon series,
[4552.30 → 4553.98] you've been learning about how Paul's letter
[4553.98 → 4556.20] to the Thessalonian church encourages them
[4556.20 → 4559.58] to live as Christians in the present day
[4559.58 → 4562.82] as they wait in hope for Christ's return.
[4564.50 → 4566.42] And in the specific passage we've looked at today,
[4566.52 → 4569.54] Paul expresses his heart for the believers in Thessalonica
[4569.54 → 4572.40] to say that they are not alone in their trials.
[4572.40 → 4575.82] In doing so, he also reminds us,
[4576.54 → 4580.66] sorry, in doing so, he also reminded them
[4580.66 → 4582.62] that suffering is part of their destiny
[4582.62 → 4583.94] as followers of Jesus.
[4585.02 → 4586.38] Likewise for us,
[4587.18 → 4589.24] facing opposition and even persecution
[4589.24 → 4590.82] in our current cultural climate
[4590.82 → 4594.00] is part of our destiny as we follow Jesus.
[4595.42 → 4597.56] Accepting it as part of our faith journey
[4597.56 → 4600.68] will not only help us to persevere in faith,
[4600.68 → 4604.18] but it would also lead us to rejoice,
[4604.90 → 4606.62] which would certainly lead those
[4606.62 → 4608.94] who don't know Christ to wonder.
[4613.78 → 4616.38] We can also be assured that we are not alone
[4616.38 → 4618.10] as we face various trials
[4618.10 → 4620.98] because God has given us the church,
[4621.54 → 4622.74] the community of faith
[4622.74 → 4625.24] with whom we're called to gather regularly
[4625.24 → 4626.94] to encourage one another.
[4626.94 → 4628.34] But ultimately,
[4629.16 → 4630.84] we do not face these trials alone
[4630.84 → 4633.02] because Jesus has assured us
[4633.02 → 4634.86] that he will be with us always
[4634.86 → 4637.22] to the very end of the age.
[4638.86 → 4641.26] Though he may be separated from us physically,
[4642.04 → 4643.48] it will only be a short time
[4643.48 → 4645.42] because he will come again soon.
[4646.70 → 4647.42] Not only that,
[4647.46 → 4648.50] he's with us in trials
[4648.50 → 4650.32] because he has given his spirit
[4650.32 → 4651.40] to dwell in us.
[4651.84 → 4653.16] The Holy Spirit is the very assurance
[4653.16 → 4655.94] that Jesus has not abandoned us
[4655.94 → 4657.70] or forgotten about us.
[4658.58 → 4659.94] So when we're faced with trials,
[4660.04 → 4661.90] he's with us through his spirit
[4661.90 → 4663.08] who teaches us
[4663.08 → 4666.56] and reminds us of all that Jesus has said.
[4669.06 → 4670.14] So may we,
[4671.60 → 4673.84] like many who stood firm in their faith
[4673.84 → 4675.94] when faced with trials,
[4675.94 → 4678.28] also stand firm,
[4679.18 → 4681.92] having our gaze fixed upon Christ
[4681.92 → 4683.40] until his return
[4683.40 → 4686.14] so that we may present ourselves
[4686.14 → 4688.56] blameless in his presence.
[4689.36 → 4689.64] Amen.
[4689.98 → 4690.44] Let's pray.
[4698.00 → 4698.98] Heavenly Father,
[4699.10 → 4700.20] we thank you for your word.
[4701.84 → 4703.72] We thank you for the assurance
[4703.72 → 4706.44] that we are not alone
[4706.44 → 4709.44] because of your son
[4709.44 → 4711.54] who is with us
[4711.54 → 4712.62] always
[4712.62 → 4715.02] to the very end of the age,
[4715.72 → 4717.50] because of your spirit
[4717.50 → 4718.72] who dwells in us,
[4719.50 → 4721.28] but also because of your people,
[4721.72 → 4722.28] the church.
[4723.72 → 4726.22] We're called to gather regularly
[4726.22 → 4727.82] to love
[4727.82 → 4729.22] and to encourage one another
[4729.22 → 4730.94] as we together face trials
[4730.94 → 4733.84] of trials of various kinds
[4733.84 → 4734.82] in our own lives.
[4737.48 → 4738.84] Father, strengthen us.
[4739.86 → 4740.96] Keep us steadfast
[4740.96 → 4742.24] in our faith
[4742.24 → 4744.42] as we wait
[4744.42 → 4745.84] for your son's return,
[4747.14 → 4747.82] bringing with him
[4747.82 → 4748.44] his kingdom
[4748.44 → 4750.60] and all those
[4750.60 → 4751.66] who have gone before us.
[4754.32 → 4755.82] This we pray in Jesus' name.
[4756.52 → 4756.72] Amen.
[4756.72 → 4756.82] Amen.
[4760.94 → 4766.66] Amen.
[4766.66 → 4766.74] Amen.
[4766.74 → 4768.02] Amen.
[4768.08 → 4769.38] Amen.
[4769.48 → 4769.92] Amen.
[4770.02 → 4770.40] Amen.
[4770.40 → 4770.48] Amen.
[4770.48 → 4770.76] Amen.
[4770.76 → 4770.98] Amen.
[4770.98 → 4771.44] Amen.
[4771.64 → 4771.88] Amen.
[4771.88 → 4771.98] Amen.
[4771.98 → 4772.02] Amen.
[4772.08 → 4772.84] Amen.
[4774.90 → 4780.86] Amen.
[4780.86 → 4782.92] Amen.
[4782.92 → 4782.96] Amen.
[4783.18 → 4783.46] Amen.
[4783.54 → 4784.02] Amen.
[4784.24 → 4784.34] Amen.
[4784.34 → 4784.70] Amen.
[4784.94 → 4785.22] Amen.
[4785.26 → 4786.64] Amen.
[4786.70 → 4787.04] Amen.
[4787.04 → 4788.50] Amen.
[4788.50 → 4789.54] Amen.
[4789.54 → 4790.08] Amen.
[4790.08 → 4798.98] But I think we'd see the hand of God
[4798.98 → 4805.20] In the light of creation's grand design
[4805.20 → 4812.32] In the lives of those who prove his faithfulness
[4812.32 → 4817.18] Who walk by faith and not by sight
[4817.18 → 4825.68] By faith our fathers roll the earth
[4825.68 → 4832.22] With the power of his promise in their hearts
[4832.22 → 4838.48] Of a holy city built by God's own man
[4838.48 → 4842.86] A place where peace and justice reign
[4842.86 → 4848.66] We will stand as children of the promise
[4848.66 → 4855.24] We will fix our eyes on him, our souls reward
[4855.24 → 4861.36] Till the race is finished, and the work is done
[4861.36 → 4867.16] We'll walk by faith and not by sight
[4867.16 → 4875.60] By faith the prophets saw a day
[4875.60 → 4881.32] When the long for desire would appear
[4881.32 → 4888.62] With the power to break the chains of sin and death
[4888.62 → 4893.70] And rise triumphant from the grave
[4893.70 → 4898.70] By faith the church was called to go
[4898.70 → 4905.88] In the power of the Spirit to the lost
[4905.88 → 4912.70] To deliver captives and to preach good news
[4912.70 → 4917.20] In every corner of the earth
[4917.20 → 4922.70] We will stand as children of the promise
[4922.70 → 4929.28] We will fix our eyes on him, our souls reward
[4929.28 → 4936.12] Till the race is finished, and the work is done
[4936.12 → 4941.40] We'll walk by faith and not by sight
[4941.40 → 4949.40] By faith the mountain shall be moved
[4949.40 → 4954.94] And the power of the gospel shall prevail
[4954.94 → 4961.68] For we know with Christ all things are possible
[4961.68 → 4967.52] For all who call upon his name
[4967.52 → 4972.52] We will stand as children of the promise
[4972.52 → 4979.72] We will fix our eyes on him, our souls reward
[4979.72 → 4986.64] Till the race is finished, and the work is done
[4986.64 → 4991.52] We'll walk by faith and not by sight
[4991.52 → 4996.52] We will stand as children of the promise
[4996.52 → 5002.52] We will fix our eyes on him, our souls reward
[5002.52 → 5009.52] Till the race is finished, and the work is done
[5009.52 → 5014.52] We'll walk by faith and not by sight
[5014.52 → 5028.44] People of God, receive God's blessing
[5028.44 → 5033.56] May God our Father and His Son Jesus Christ our Lord
[5033.56 → 5037.56] Strengthen your hearts in trial so that you will be blameless
[5037.56 → 5040.42] And holy in His presence when He returns
[5040.42 → 5044.42] And until that day, may God make your love increase
[5044.42 → 5046.62] And overflow for each other
[5046.62 → 5049.62] As you endure the trials together in community
[5049.62 → 5053.76] By the power of the Holy Spirit at work in you
[5053.76 → 5056.60] The one who calls you is faithful
[5056.60 → 5058.80] And He will do it
[5058.80 → 5059.58] Amen
[5059.82 → 5060.80] Amen
[5060.80 → 5062.60] Amen
[5062.60 → 5063.70] Amen
[5063.70 → 5064.74] Amen
[5064.74 → 5066.80] Amen
[5066.80 → 5069.38] Amen
[5069.38 → 5076.38] Amen
[5078.62 → 5079.82] Amen

[5084.84 → 5085.68] Amen
[5085.68 → 5088.30] Amen
[5088.30 → 5096.82] Praise Father, from whom all blessings flow.
[5097.82 → 5102.48] Praise Him, all creatures here below.
[5102.48 → 5108.48] Praise Him, above ye heavenly hosts.
[5109.70 → 5115.82] Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
[5118.30 → 5124.60] Let earth and heavenly saints proclaim
[5124.60 → 5130.60] The power and light of His reign.
[5130.60 → 5136.72] Let us exalt on bended knee.
[5137.14 → 5142.26] Praise God, the Holy Trinity.
[5142.26 → 5150.36] Praise God, praise God.
[5150.36 → 5154.76] Praise God, who saved our soul.
[5154.76 → 5158.56] Praise God, praise God.
[5158.56 → 5163.56] Praise God, from whom all blessings flow.
[5163.56 → 5171.86] Praise to the King, His throne transcends.
[5171.86 → 5177.56] His crown and kingdom never end.
[5177.56 → 5182.36] Now and throughout eternity.
[5182.36 → 5196.36] Praise God, praise God.
[5196.36 → 5200.66] Praise God, who saved our soul.
