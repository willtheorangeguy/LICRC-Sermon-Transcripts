[2689.00 --> 2700.40]  All my days, all my life, have it all
[2719.00 --> 2725.10]  Excellent. Let's everyone follow Dawson's example
[2725.10 --> 2731.58]  We're looking for kids preschool to kind of kindergarten aged
[2731.58 --> 2733.96]  And really anyone else who wants to come up
[2733.96 --> 2740.64]  We're going to do a blessing as those youngest among us head out to children's worship time
[2740.64 --> 2743.52]  And we're going to do that blessing together
[2743.52 --> 2746.34]  So I'm going to get you guys, Andy, do it, stay up here
[2746.34 --> 2750.62]  I'm going to get you guys right away, let's stand up together
[2750.62 --> 2754.82]  Come on up to the front, come this way and then everyone can see us
[2754.82 --> 2759.64]  Okay, we're going to stand, you guys may also stand as well
[2759.64 --> 2763.40]  We're going to together say the Lord be with you
[2763.40 --> 2767.06]  And then we'll invite you to respond by saying and also with you
[2767.06 --> 2774.42]  After we give the blessing, you guys can calmly and collectively walk down the aisle together to the back
[2774.42 --> 2777.44]  Ready? Together?
[2778.10 --> 2780.32]  The Lord be with you
[2780.32 --> 2782.18]  And also with you
[2782.18 --> 2782.54]  Amen
[2782.54 --> 2789.78]  That was
[2789.78 --> 2803.72]  Good morning
[2803.72 --> 2805.66]  My name is Ken
[2805.66 --> 2810.00]  I'm an elder at the end of my term here at Emanuel Church
[2810.00 --> 2815.00]  But I'll be doing the church family prayer and leading us in prayer this morning
[2815.00 --> 2818.60]  I just want to make a quick announcement for next week
[2818.60 --> 2821.38]  Our service next week will include communion
[2821.38 --> 2823.06]  We'll be gathering around the table together
[2823.06 --> 2829.40]  And I just encourage everyone to take a little time this week to think about and prepare your hearts for that
[2829.40 --> 2832.98]  Also, an announcement, it wasn't in the bulletin
[2832.98 --> 2838.16]  But we're excitedly anticipating with Alvin and Lisa their wedding this Friday
[2838.16 --> 2841.26]  They will be getting married this Friday in a private ceremony
[2841.26 --> 2848.14]  And we just pray for them and encourage them as they prepare for this and head into their marriage
[2848.14 --> 2849.32]  And we pray for that as well
[2849.32 --> 2852.70]  And yeah, before we go into our prayer
[2852.70 --> 2858.66]  I just want to draw a note to some of the content in this prayer
[2858.66 --> 2863.20]  We have the classes that we've been doing on the Heidelberg Catechism
[2863.20 --> 2866.54]  Kind of a reading discussion group while the youth were doing HCBC
[2866.54 --> 2872.24]  And it was a really good time of getting together and kind of pouring over and looking at the detail of some of the Heidelberg Catechism
[2872.24 --> 2877.14]  And the last 10 or so Lord's Days focus in on the Lord's Prayer
[2877.14 --> 2881.66]  And I found it really neat to kind of open up the hood and look inside the Lord's Prayer
[2881.66 --> 2885.18]  A little more slowly than we tend to as we roll through it
[2885.18 --> 2889.30]  And kind of study some of the detail of what's meant by the words of the Lord's Prayer
[2889.30 --> 2893.82]  So you'll hear that wrapped into and rolled into our prayer as we pray this morning
[2893.82 --> 2895.00]  Let us pray
[2895.00 --> 2900.20]  Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be your name
[2900.20 --> 2904.84]  You alone are worthy of all honor, glory, and praise
[2904.84 --> 2908.18]  We come to you this morning as your children
[2908.18 --> 2912.98]  Knowing, Father, that just as our parents do not refuse us the things of this life
[2912.98 --> 2917.62]  You most certainly will not refuse to give us what we ask for in true faith
[2917.62 --> 2921.04]  Help us to know you deeply, Lord
[2921.04 --> 2926.80]  And to see your almighty power, wisdom, kindness, justice, mercy, and truth
[2926.80 --> 2929.02]  Which shine through all your works
[2929.02 --> 2933.08]  Help us live lives that never blaspheme your name
[2933.08 --> 2937.00]  But may your name be honored and praised throughout our lives
[2937.00 --> 2939.60]  Lord, let your kingdom come
[2939.60 --> 2945.58]  Rule us by your word and spirit in such a way that more and more we submit to you
[2945.58 --> 2950.04]  We ask that you preserve your church and make it grow
[2950.04 --> 2952.18]  Destroy the devil's work
[2952.18 --> 2955.28]  Everything that does not follow you and your word
[2955.28 --> 2959.44]  Until your kingdom comes fully and you are all in all
[2959.44 --> 2963.64]  May your will be done on earth as it is in heaven
[2963.64 --> 2968.60]  Help us reject our own wills and obey your good will alone
[2968.60 --> 2973.84]  Help us willingly and faithfully carry out the work we are called to do
[2973.84 --> 2976.28]  We pray for Emmanuel Church
[2976.28 --> 2978.60]  That you would guide the ministries of this church
[2978.60 --> 2982.10]  And put your will for this church deeply rooted in our hearts
[2982.10 --> 2984.72]  We pray for the leaders of our church
[2984.72 --> 2987.86]  The pastors, ministry leaders, elders, and deacons
[2987.86 --> 2991.94]  That you would mold us like jars of clay to carry out your will
[2991.94 --> 2997.58]  We boldly pray that our mission to spread the gospel would extend beyond this church
[2997.58 --> 3000.68]  And that each of us here would faithfully answer the call
[3000.68 --> 3006.02]  To share the love of Christ with our neighbors, co-workers, and all who you put in our path
[3006.02 --> 3011.26]  Help us boldly profess our salvation in Christ alone
[3011.26 --> 3015.72]  We praise you, Lord, for the profession of faith of Alyssa this morning
[3015.72 --> 3018.68]  And the faith that you have given her as her savior
[3018.68 --> 3020.98]  Guide her with your truth
[3020.98 --> 3025.34]  And surround her with a community that encourages and supports her faith journey
[3025.34 --> 3028.82]  Give us this day, Lord, our daily bread
[3028.82 --> 3033.54]  Help us know that you are the only source of everything good
[3033.54 --> 3039.68]  And that neither our work and worry, nor your gifts, can do us any good without your blessing
[3039.68 --> 3042.92]  Help us trust in you alone, Lord
[3042.92 --> 3045.26]  We pray for our physical health
[3045.26 --> 3047.92]  Heal us from diseases in our bodies
[3047.92 --> 3050.80]  We lift up Tanya, who is in hospice
[3050.80 --> 3053.66]  Please continue to give her peace and strength
[3053.66 --> 3055.88]  And times of joy with loved ones
[3055.88 --> 3059.16]  Help her feel your nearness throughout this journey
[3059.16 --> 3062.58]  We pray for Doug, who continues to battle cancer
[3062.58 --> 3066.84]  Give him the strength to press on and all he stands in need of
[3066.84 --> 3070.02]  We pray for Tessa and rejoice with her
[3070.02 --> 3072.80]  As her chemo is complete and she is feeling better
[3072.80 --> 3077.56]  We pray that you give her patience as she waits for future scan results
[3077.56 --> 3081.90]  We are also grateful that Clary's sister Joan is feeling well
[3081.90 --> 3085.92]  And we pray for your healing hand on her throughout her cancer journey
[3085.92 --> 3089.90]  Lord, we also pray for your healing mercies
[3089.90 --> 3092.62]  As many of us deal with various mental health struggles
[3092.62 --> 3098.50]  Lord, carry us and our burdens of grief, depression, sadness, and addiction
[3098.50 --> 3101.66]  As we walk through the darkest valleys
[3101.66 --> 3107.70]  Replace our fear with the comfort that you are our good shepherd who never leaves us
[3107.70 --> 3110.52]  We pray for those who are underemployed
[3110.52 --> 3114.70]  That we would find opportunities to use the gifts you have given us
[3114.70 --> 3118.98]  We also lift up those who are taking vacations from their work this summer
[3118.98 --> 3122.36]  That you would give us safety, if it may be, with travel
[3122.36 --> 3126.28]  And rest from the routines of the regular rhythms of our work
[3126.28 --> 3131.08]  We pray for all who are attending Warm Beach Bible Camp this weekend
[3131.08 --> 3133.92]  May it be a time of deep spiritual growth
[3133.92 --> 3139.08]  With renewing hearts, building friendships, and drawing everyone closer to you, Lord
[3139.08 --> 3142.56]  Bless the leaders with wisdom and energy
[3142.56 --> 3146.56]  And the youth with open hearts to receive all you have for them
[3146.56 --> 3148.98]  Lord, we pray for our marriages
[3148.98 --> 3150.74]  That you would strengthen them
[3150.74 --> 3154.32]  And help us to model the love of Christ for the church
[3154.32 --> 3156.78]  And the love of the church for Christ
[3156.78 --> 3158.60]  With each other in our marriages
[3158.60 --> 3161.54]  Lord, we pray for Alvin and Lisa
[3161.54 --> 3163.40]  As they will be married this Friday
[3163.40 --> 3165.90]  And as they enter into their life of marriage
[3165.90 --> 3167.54]  Lord, would you bless them
[3167.54 --> 3168.66]  And be near to them
[3168.66 --> 3170.82]  And may their marriage be centered on you alone
[3170.82 --> 3173.56]  Lord, forgive us our debts
[3173.56 --> 3176.28]  As we also have forgiven our debtors
[3176.28 --> 3178.70]  Because of Christ's blood
[3178.70 --> 3180.52]  Do not hold against us
[3180.52 --> 3181.98]  Poor sinners that we are
[3181.98 --> 3184.06]  Any of the sins we do
[3184.06 --> 3187.08]  Or the evil that constantly clings to us
[3187.08 --> 3190.34]  Forgive us just as we are fully determined
[3190.34 --> 3191.68]  To forgive our neighbors
[3191.68 --> 3195.24]  Let the forgiveness we extend to our neighbors
[3195.24 --> 3197.88]  Be evidence of your grace in us
[3197.88 --> 3200.82]  And Lord, lead us not into temptation
[3200.82 --> 3203.04]  But deliver us from the evil one
[3203.04 --> 3206.60]  By ourselves, we are too weak to hold on our own
[3206.60 --> 3207.82]  Even for a moment
[3207.82 --> 3209.90]  And our sworn enemies
[3209.90 --> 3213.02]  Namely the devil, the world, and our own flesh
[3213.02 --> 3214.78]  Never stop attacking us
[3214.78 --> 3217.06]  And so, Lord, uphold us
[3217.06 --> 3218.20]  And make us strong
[3218.20 --> 3220.04]  With the strength of your Holy Spirit
[3220.04 --> 3222.66]  So that we may not go down to defeat
[3222.66 --> 3223.94]  In this spiritual struggle
[3223.94 --> 3226.32]  But we may firmly resist our enemies
[3226.32 --> 3229.02]  Until we finally win the complete victory
[3229.02 --> 3231.94]  Lord, we lift up your world
[3231.94 --> 3233.80]  As it groans with wars
[3233.80 --> 3235.96]  Famine, wildfire, floods
[3235.96 --> 3237.96]  Father, we acknowledge
[3237.96 --> 3239.78]  That all authority is yours
[3239.78 --> 3240.96]  And comes from you alone
[3240.96 --> 3242.84]  We pray for world leaders
[3242.84 --> 3244.82]  That when tensions rise
[3244.82 --> 3246.24]  Your truth withdraw them
[3246.24 --> 3247.38]  Toward your kingdom
[3247.38 --> 3250.24]  For the kingdom and the power
[3250.24 --> 3251.84]  And the glory are yours forever
[3251.84 --> 3254.86]  We have made all these petitions of you
[3254.86 --> 3257.78]  Because as our all-powerful king
[3257.78 --> 3259.80]  You are both willing and able
[3259.80 --> 3261.28]  To give us all that is good
[3261.28 --> 3263.80]  We do not deserve any recognition
[3263.80 --> 3265.12]  On our own merit, Lord
[3265.12 --> 3267.10]  But by your holy name
[3267.10 --> 3269.46]  You should receive all the praise forever
[3269.46 --> 3272.66]  As Pastor Chris brings us your message this morning
[3272.66 --> 3274.44]  Help us to hear your voice
[3274.44 --> 3275.34]  Your word
[3275.34 --> 3276.32]  And your truth
[3276.32 --> 3278.68]  Lord, truly and surely
[3278.68 --> 3280.08]  You listen to our prayers
[3280.08 --> 3282.74]  We recognize that it is even more sure
[3282.74 --> 3284.24]  That you listen to our prayers
[3284.24 --> 3286.38]  Than it is that we really desire
[3286.38 --> 3287.30]  What we pray for
[3287.30 --> 3290.42]  And so, in the name of Jesus Christ alone
[3290.42 --> 3291.74]  We pray all this
[3291.74 --> 3292.34]  Amen
[3292.34 --> 3315.84]  I know Ken said it before he started praying
[3315.84 --> 3316.26]  But
[3316.26 --> 3324.62]  What Ken just did in that prayer
[3324.62 --> 3326.62]  I want to note as we come to the word
[3326.62 --> 3331.82]  Ken took an almost 500-year-old expression
[3331.82 --> 3335.76]  Of an almost 2,000-year-old prayer
[3335.76 --> 3338.94]  And made it imminently present
[3338.94 --> 3343.14]  That's the church, friends
[3343.14 --> 3345.66]  That's the body of believers
[3345.66 --> 3348.68]  That's the living tradition
[3348.68 --> 3350.68]  Of a faith alive
[3350.68 --> 3353.62]  That's what we stand in
[3353.62 --> 3354.64]  When we gather for worship
[3354.64 --> 3358.10]  A deeply rooted
[3358.10 --> 3361.36]  And historical activity
[3361.36 --> 3363.34]  Of a living God
[3363.34 --> 3364.76]  Who draws us to himself
[3364.76 --> 3367.16]  And that living God
[3367.16 --> 3368.58]  Is still speaking to us
[3368.58 --> 3369.94]  And he does so through his word
[3369.94 --> 3373.66]  This morning, we're going to continue
[3373.66 --> 3376.72]  In our look at the gospel
[3376.72 --> 3377.86]  According to Matthew
[3377.86 --> 3380.26]  And we're doing this this summer
[3380.26 --> 3382.22]  Under a particular banner
[3382.22 --> 3384.00]  Of behold your king
[3384.00 --> 3386.98]  Because this is less about
[3386.98 --> 3388.80]  Learning something new
[3388.80 --> 3391.78]  And more about seeing Jesus
[3391.78 --> 3395.20]  I mean, I hope you learn something
[3395.20 --> 3398.12]  But I hope more than that
[3398.12 --> 3399.70]  That learning draws you
[3399.70 --> 3402.06]  Into the presence of our Savior
[3402.06 --> 3404.64]  And that by these words
[3404.64 --> 3406.12]  You might hear God's word
[3406.12 --> 3407.68]  And that in hearing God's word
[3407.68 --> 3409.88]  You might see his son
[3409.88 --> 3412.18]  Our Savior and king
[3412.18 --> 3414.80]  And so let's read this morning
[3414.80 --> 3416.40]  That Jesus might be revealed
[3416.40 --> 3417.32]  To our hearts
[3417.32 --> 3420.26]  As we look at the stories
[3420.26 --> 3421.40]  Of Jesus' baptism
[3421.40 --> 3423.70]  And his testing in the wilderness
[3423.70 --> 3425.60]  I'm going to read
[3425.60 --> 3426.82]  From chapter 3
[3426.82 --> 3428.14]  Starting at verse 13
[3428.14 --> 3429.70]  And we'll read through
[3429.70 --> 3431.68]  Chapter 4, verse 11
[3431.68 --> 3433.60]  Let's read together
[3433.60 --> 3437.86]  Then Jesus came from Galilee
[3437.86 --> 3438.70]  To the Jordan
[3438.70 --> 3440.20]  To be baptized by John
[3440.20 --> 3443.18]  But John tried to deter him
[3443.18 --> 3446.72]  Saying, I need to be baptized
[3446.72 --> 3447.70]  By you
[3447.70 --> 3449.82]  And do you come to me?
[3450.86 --> 3451.96]  And Jesus replied
[3451.96 --> 3453.66]  Let it be so now
[3453.66 --> 3456.02]  It is proper for us to do this
[3456.02 --> 3457.88]  To fulfill all righteousness
[3457.88 --> 3460.16]  Then John consented
[3460.16 --> 3463.62]  As soon as Jesus was baptized
[3463.62 --> 3465.52]  He went up out of the water
[3465.52 --> 3466.86]  And at that moment
[3466.86 --> 3468.12]  Heaven was opened
[3468.12 --> 3470.18]  And he saw the Spirit of God
[3470.18 --> 3471.92]  Descending like a dove
[3471.92 --> 3473.28]  And alighting on him
[3473.28 --> 3475.42]  And a voice from heaven said
[3475.42 --> 3477.50]  This is my Son
[3477.50 --> 3479.58]  Whom I love
[3479.58 --> 3481.30]  With him
[3481.30 --> 3483.58]  I am well pleased
[3483.58 --> 3487.40]  Then Jesus was led
[3487.40 --> 3488.12]  By the Spirit
[3488.12 --> 3489.14]  Into the wilderness
[3489.14 --> 3490.24]  To be tempted
[3490.24 --> 3492.80]  Tempted
[3492.80 --> 3493.76]  By the devil
[3493.76 --> 3496.92]  After fasting 40 days
[3496.92 --> 3498.02]  And 40 nights
[3498.02 --> 3498.92]  He was hungry
[3498.92 --> 3501.50]  The tempter came to him
[3501.50 --> 3502.10]  And said
[3502.10 --> 3504.68]  If you are the Son of God
[3504.68 --> 3506.08]  Tell these stones
[3506.08 --> 3507.00]  To become bread
[3507.00 --> 3509.62]  Jesus answered
[3509.62 --> 3511.00]  It is written
[3511.00 --> 3512.42]  Man shall not live
[3512.42 --> 3513.34]  On bread alone
[3513.34 --> 3514.74]  But on every word
[3514.74 --> 3515.66]  That comes
[3515.66 --> 3516.86]  From the mouth of God
[3516.86 --> 3519.60]  Then the devil
[3519.60 --> 3520.24]  Took him
[3520.24 --> 3521.84]  To the holy city
[3521.84 --> 3522.84]  And had him stand
[3522.84 --> 3523.88]  On the highest point
[3523.88 --> 3524.52]  Of the temple
[3524.52 --> 3526.70]  If you are the Son of God
[3526.70 --> 3527.16]  He said
[3527.16 --> 3528.56]  Throw yourself down
[3528.56 --> 3529.72]  For it is written
[3529.72 --> 3531.56]  But he will command
[3531.56 --> 3532.24]  His angels
[3532.24 --> 3533.22]  Concerning you
[3533.22 --> 3534.96]  And they will lift you up
[3534.96 --> 3535.72]  In their hands
[3535.72 --> 3537.44]  So that you will not
[3537.44 --> 3538.46]  Strike your foot
[3538.46 --> 3539.34]  Against a stone
[3539.34 --> 3541.88]  Jesus answered him
[3541.88 --> 3543.84]  It is also written
[3543.84 --> 3545.60]  Do not put the Lord
[3545.60 --> 3546.34]  Your God
[3546.34 --> 3547.22]  To the test
[3547.22 --> 3549.68]  Again
[3549.68 --> 3551.50]  The devil took him
[3551.50 --> 3552.58]  To a very high mountain
[3552.58 --> 3553.28]  And showed him
[3553.28 --> 3554.14]  All the kingdoms
[3554.14 --> 3555.32]  Of the world
[3555.32 --> 3556.54]  And their splendor
[3556.54 --> 3558.36]  All this
[3558.36 --> 3559.70]  I will give you
[3559.70 --> 3560.22]  He said
[3560.22 --> 3562.22]  If you bow down
[3562.22 --> 3563.92]  And worship me
[3563.92 --> 3567.20]  Jesus said to him
[3567.20 --> 3568.74]  Away from me
[3568.74 --> 3569.14]  Satan
[3569.14 --> 3570.52]  For it is written
[3570.52 --> 3571.58]  Worship the Lord
[3571.58 --> 3572.22]  Your God
[3572.22 --> 3573.46]  And serve him
[3573.46 --> 3574.48]  Only
[3574.48 --> 3576.50]  Then the devil
[3576.50 --> 3577.14]  Left him
[3577.14 --> 3578.64]  And angels came
[3578.64 --> 3580.10]  And attended him
[3580.10 --> 3581.60]  This is the word
[3581.60 --> 3582.06]  Of the Lord
[3582.06 --> 3590.82]  We are a people
[3590.82 --> 3592.94]  In search
[3592.94 --> 3595.46]  Of identity
[3595.46 --> 3597.82]  From the time
[3597.82 --> 3598.74]  We're young
[3598.74 --> 3599.48]  The littlest
[3599.48 --> 3600.28]  Among us
[3600.28 --> 3601.40]  Ask questions
[3601.40 --> 3602.28]  About ourselves
[3602.28 --> 3603.32]  Who am I
[3603.32 --> 3604.94]  But by the time
[3604.94 --> 3605.58]  We're older
[3605.58 --> 3606.80]  That question
[3606.80 --> 3607.86]  Often shifts
[3607.86 --> 3608.34]  To
[3608.34 --> 3609.48]  Am I enough
[3609.48 --> 3612.58]  We try to find
[3612.58 --> 3613.98]  A name
[3613.98 --> 3615.08]  Ourselves
[3615.08 --> 3616.62]  Through the things
[3616.62 --> 3617.28]  We do
[3617.28 --> 3618.50]  Through relationships
[3618.50 --> 3620.24]  Through performances
[3620.24 --> 3622.62]  We live in a world
[3622.62 --> 3623.40]  That promises
[3623.40 --> 3624.10]  Freedom
[3624.10 --> 3626.18]  Through self-expression
[3626.18 --> 3626.68]  But then
[3626.68 --> 3628.10]  Burdens us
[3628.10 --> 3629.14]  With the pressure
[3629.14 --> 3630.30]  Of self-definition
[3630.30 --> 3632.98]  And when you
[3632.98 --> 3633.76]  Are the only one
[3633.76 --> 3634.46]  Responsible
[3634.46 --> 3635.66]  For defining yourself
[3635.66 --> 3636.78]  It's only a matter
[3636.78 --> 3637.40]  Of time
[3637.40 --> 3638.42]  Before you feel
[3638.42 --> 3639.78]  Like you're failing
[3639.78 --> 3640.92]  At being you
[3640.92 --> 3644.04]  We long
[3644.04 --> 3644.64]  To hear
[3644.64 --> 3645.70]  Someone say
[3645.70 --> 3647.12]  I see you
[3647.12 --> 3648.92]  I know you
[3648.92 --> 3651.32]  I love you
[3651.32 --> 3653.26]  You belong
[3653.26 --> 3656.42]  But most of us
[3656.42 --> 3657.46]  In our ordinary lives
[3657.46 --> 3658.92]  Hear the opposite
[3658.92 --> 3659.80]  We hear voices
[3659.80 --> 3660.64]  That say
[3660.64 --> 3661.90]  We're not enough
[3661.90 --> 3662.42]  That we're not
[3662.42 --> 3663.42]  Successful enough
[3663.42 --> 3663.88]  That we're not
[3663.88 --> 3664.80]  Spiritual enough
[3664.80 --> 3665.22]  That we're not
[3665.22 --> 3665.84]  Good enough
[3665.84 --> 3666.30]  That we're not
[3666.30 --> 3667.50]  Worthy of love
[3667.50 --> 3669.02]  And for most of us
[3669.02 --> 3669.90]  That voice
[3669.90 --> 3670.98]  Is the loudest
[3670.98 --> 3671.94]  In our own heads
[3671.94 --> 3674.58]  But for some of us
[3674.58 --> 3675.82]  That voice
[3675.82 --> 3676.42]  Is confirmed
[3676.42 --> 3677.20]  By the people
[3677.20 --> 3678.70]  And the circumstances
[3678.70 --> 3679.52]  Around us
[3679.52 --> 3682.16]  And again
[3682.16 --> 3683.22]  Even kids
[3683.22 --> 3684.56]  Long for this
[3684.56 --> 3685.32]  Right
[3685.32 --> 3685.96]  Every kid
[3685.96 --> 3686.68]  Wants to hear
[3686.68 --> 3687.40]  Their parents
[3687.40 --> 3688.28]  Or a teacher
[3688.28 --> 3689.16]  Or a coach
[3689.16 --> 3689.62]  Say
[3689.62 --> 3690.80]  I'm proud of you
[3690.80 --> 3692.14]  I'm glad
[3692.14 --> 3692.90]  You're here
[3692.90 --> 3694.50]  Right
[3694.50 --> 3694.96]  That's not just
[3694.96 --> 3695.72]  A kid thing
[3695.72 --> 3696.52]  That's a people
[3696.52 --> 3696.92]  Thing
[3696.92 --> 3697.90]  That's a human
[3697.90 --> 3698.38]  Thing
[3698.38 --> 3699.14]  And that never
[3699.14 --> 3700.10]  Really goes away
[3700.10 --> 3703.10]  But when we
[3703.10 --> 3704.00]  Don't hear it
[3704.00 --> 3705.78]  We hide
[3705.78 --> 3708.44]  When we don't
[3708.44 --> 3708.78]  Hear it
[3708.78 --> 3709.70]  We perform
[3709.70 --> 3711.62]  And then
[3711.62 --> 3712.34]  We numb
[3712.34 --> 3713.14]  Ourselves
[3713.14 --> 3714.08]  Through various
[3714.08 --> 3715.04]  Means
[3715.04 --> 3717.24]  We scroll
[3717.24 --> 3718.50]  Ad nauseum
[3718.50 --> 3720.08]  We edit
[3720.08 --> 3720.68]  Our image
[3720.68 --> 3721.44]  Before we post
[3721.44 --> 3722.14]  It online
[3722.14 --> 3723.78]  We tell stories
[3723.78 --> 3724.62]  About ourselves
[3724.62 --> 3725.54]  That we hope
[3725.54 --> 3726.42]  Are true
[3726.42 --> 3727.30]  Or at least
[3727.30 --> 3727.76]  That we hope
[3727.76 --> 3728.22]  Other people
[3728.22 --> 3728.74]  Will believe
[3728.74 --> 3731.56]  And all the while
[3731.56 --> 3733.02]  There's this
[3733.02 --> 3733.94]  Ache
[3733.94 --> 3734.78]  In us
[3734.78 --> 3735.78]  This deep down
[3735.78 --> 3736.64]  Longing
[3736.64 --> 3737.52]  To be known
[3737.52 --> 3738.70]  And not rejected
[3738.70 --> 3739.98]  To be seen
[3739.98 --> 3741.20]  And not shamed
[3741.20 --> 3742.86]  To be claimed
[3742.86 --> 3743.86]  Without having
[3743.86 --> 3745.02]  To prove anything
[3745.02 --> 3746.48]  Right
[3746.48 --> 3747.08]  We ache
[3747.08 --> 3748.28]  For this
[3748.28 --> 3749.68]  Being named
[3749.68 --> 3750.66]  By someone
[3750.66 --> 3751.80]  Greater than us
[3751.80 --> 3752.80]  We ache
[3752.80 --> 3753.88]  For a voice
[3753.88 --> 3754.70]  That can say
[3754.70 --> 3755.60]  With authority
[3755.60 --> 3757.50]  You are mine
[3757.50 --> 3758.72]  I delight
[3758.72 --> 3759.72]  In you
[3759.72 --> 3762.38]  But in a world
[3762.38 --> 3763.36]  Where approval
[3763.36 --> 3764.26]  Is conditional
[3764.26 --> 3765.28]  And identity
[3765.28 --> 3766.22]  Is constantly
[3766.22 --> 3767.64]  Up for negotiation
[3767.64 --> 3769.10]  That kind of voice
[3769.10 --> 3770.12]  Just feels impossible
[3770.12 --> 3770.82]  To hear
[3770.82 --> 3772.56]  Right
[3772.56 --> 3773.48]  All we really know
[3773.48 --> 3774.20]  Is the hustle
[3774.20 --> 3775.22]  To earn it
[3775.22 --> 3777.38]  And the haunting
[3777.38 --> 3777.94]  Fear
[3777.94 --> 3779.04]  That will never
[3779.04 --> 3780.00]  Actually measure up
[3780.00 --> 3782.90]  We are a generation
[3782.90 --> 3783.90]  In the midst
[3783.90 --> 3785.20]  Of an identity crisis
[3785.20 --> 3786.64]  We're told
[3786.64 --> 3787.66]  To be yourself
[3787.66 --> 3788.44]  But we're given
[3788.44 --> 3788.96]  No direction
[3788.96 --> 3789.74]  For what that self
[3789.74 --> 3790.24]  Should be
[3790.24 --> 3791.86]  And we swing
[3791.86 --> 3792.76]  Between pride
[3792.76 --> 3793.90]  And despair
[3793.90 --> 3795.10]  Never quite certain
[3795.10 --> 3795.80]  Of who we are
[3795.80 --> 3797.18]  One day
[3797.18 --> 3798.30]  We feel okay
[3798.30 --> 3798.88]  Maybe
[3798.88 --> 3799.78]  The next
[3799.78 --> 3800.52]  We're not sure
[3800.52 --> 3801.18]  If anyone
[3801.18 --> 3802.50]  Will ever love us
[3802.50 --> 3803.90]  Right
[3803.90 --> 3804.34]  We long
[3804.34 --> 3805.14]  For a love
[3805.14 --> 3806.78]  That cannot be lost
[3806.78 --> 3807.40]  We long
[3807.40 --> 3808.84]  And wonder
[3808.84 --> 3809.68]  What it means
[3809.68 --> 3811.02]  To be a child
[3811.02 --> 3811.64]  Of God
[3811.64 --> 3813.50]  And all the while
[3813.50 --> 3814.72]  We're waiting
[3814.72 --> 3815.66]  Just waiting
[3815.66 --> 3817.02]  To hear that voice
[3817.02 --> 3819.88]  And then
[3819.88 --> 3822.48]  As we read
[3822.48 --> 3823.10]  This morning
[3823.10 --> 3825.18]  Jesus shows up
[3825.18 --> 3826.26]  Right
[3826.26 --> 3827.10]  And into all
[3827.10 --> 3828.26]  Our identity questions
[3828.26 --> 3829.50]  Into all our striving
[3829.50 --> 3830.72]  And all our shame
[3830.72 --> 3832.08]  He steps forward
[3832.08 --> 3833.04]  To stand
[3833.04 --> 3834.30]  Where I stand
[3834.30 --> 3835.08]  He steps forward
[3835.08 --> 3835.80]  To stand
[3835.80 --> 3836.96]  Where you stand
[3836.96 --> 3837.80]  He steps forward
[3837.80 --> 3838.70]  To stand
[3838.70 --> 3839.74]  Where sinners
[3839.74 --> 3840.60]  Stand
[3840.60 --> 3842.26]  That's what John saw
[3842.26 --> 3842.94]  When Jesus
[3842.94 --> 3843.54]  Stepped forward
[3843.54 --> 3844.08]  And that's why
[3844.08 --> 3845.02]  He was confused
[3845.02 --> 3845.82]  And he said
[3845.82 --> 3847.40]  I need to be baptized
[3847.40 --> 3848.04]  By you
[3848.04 --> 3848.92]  Why do you
[3848.92 --> 3849.58]  Come to me
[3849.58 --> 3851.92]  If you've ever
[3851.92 --> 3853.30]  Seen a baptism here
[3853.30 --> 3854.76]  Maybe you remember
[3854.76 --> 3855.46]  Your own
[3855.46 --> 3856.34]  Right
[3856.34 --> 3857.70]  It's not just
[3857.70 --> 3858.56]  About getting wet
[3858.56 --> 3860.90]  It's about God
[3860.90 --> 3861.80]  Saying to you
[3861.80 --> 3863.34]  You are mine
[3863.34 --> 3865.50]  And a profession
[3865.50 --> 3865.90]  Of faith
[3865.90 --> 3866.94]  Like we witnessed
[3866.94 --> 3867.60]  And participated
[3867.60 --> 3868.26]  This morning
[3868.26 --> 3869.42]  Whether it's a profession
[3869.42 --> 3869.82]  Of faith
[3869.82 --> 3870.82]  Tied to baptism
[3870.82 --> 3872.14]  Or it's 20 years later
[3872.14 --> 3873.46]  Is us saying
[3873.46 --> 3874.22]  Yeah
[3874.22 --> 3875.66]  I am yours
[3875.66 --> 3878.60]  And so why does
[3878.60 --> 3879.58]  John ask Jesus
[3879.58 --> 3880.72]  This question
[3880.72 --> 3881.60]  Why does John say
[3881.60 --> 3882.60]  I need to be baptized
[3882.60 --> 3883.32]  By you
[3883.32 --> 3884.64]  And you come to me
[3884.64 --> 3887.62]  If you have your
[3887.62 --> 3888.26]  Bibles open
[3888.26 --> 3888.82]  And of course
[3888.82 --> 3889.68]  Always encourage you
[3889.68 --> 3890.22]  To do that
[3890.22 --> 3891.50]  In the section
[3891.50 --> 3893.30]  Immediately before ours
[3893.30 --> 3893.78]  The beginning
[3893.78 --> 3894.82]  Of chapter 3
[3894.82 --> 3898.38]  John explains
[3898.38 --> 3899.10]  He says
[3899.10 --> 3901.84]  I baptize with water
[3901.84 --> 3902.72]  For repentance
[3902.72 --> 3905.22]  Now that word repentance
[3905.22 --> 3906.30]  Is a noun
[3906.30 --> 3906.76]  Meaning
[3906.76 --> 3908.70]  A comprehensive change
[3908.70 --> 3909.94]  Or the change
[3909.94 --> 3911.00]  Of state
[3911.00 --> 3911.68]  In any
[3911.68 --> 3912.52]  Or all
[3912.52 --> 3913.30]  Of the elements
[3913.30 --> 3914.02]  Of your life
[3914.02 --> 3914.80]  Your attitude
[3914.80 --> 3915.54]  Your thoughts
[3915.54 --> 3916.38]  Your actions
[3916.38 --> 3917.34]  You're turning
[3917.34 --> 3918.86]  Towards God's design
[3918.86 --> 3919.98]  For how you live
[3919.98 --> 3920.48]  Your life
[3920.48 --> 3921.90]  Genuine repentance
[3921.90 --> 3923.18]  Means more
[3923.18 --> 3924.06]  Than just saying
[3924.06 --> 3924.88]  I'm sorry
[3924.88 --> 3926.66]  It is a change
[3926.66 --> 3927.36]  Of being
[3927.36 --> 3928.20]  And a change
[3928.20 --> 3928.94]  Of doing
[3928.94 --> 3929.52]  Right
[3929.52 --> 3930.34]  Genuine repentance
[3930.34 --> 3931.04]  Is a change
[3931.04 --> 3931.70]  In your thinking
[3931.70 --> 3932.82]  And your feeling
[3932.82 --> 3935.06]  John says
[3935.06 --> 3936.26]  Earlier in that section
[3936.26 --> 3937.80]  Produce fruit
[3937.80 --> 3938.48]  In keeping
[3938.48 --> 3939.60]  With your repentance
[3939.60 --> 3942.86]  We read
[3942.86 --> 3943.22]  Actually
[3943.22 --> 3944.46]  In one of the
[3944.46 --> 3945.30]  Other gospels
[3945.30 --> 3946.00]  That when John
[3946.00 --> 3946.84]  Sees Jesus
[3946.84 --> 3947.82]  He says
[3947.82 --> 3948.72]  Look
[3948.72 --> 3950.04]  The Lamb of God
[3950.04 --> 3950.92]  Who takes away
[3950.92 --> 3951.90]  The sin of the world
[3951.90 --> 3953.48]  Right
[3953.48 --> 3954.30]  John knows
[3954.30 --> 3955.02]  That he
[3955.02 --> 3956.38]  Needs repentance
[3956.38 --> 3957.32]  He needs
[3957.32 --> 3958.10]  A whole life
[3958.10 --> 3958.94]  Transformation
[3958.94 --> 3959.72]  Not Jesus
[3959.72 --> 3961.44]  He knows
[3961.44 --> 3961.88]  That he
[3961.88 --> 3962.58]  Should be the one
[3962.58 --> 3963.74]  Receiving baptism
[3963.74 --> 3965.14]  From Jesus
[3965.14 --> 3967.62]  John also says
[3967.62 --> 3968.62]  In that same section
[3968.62 --> 3970.44]  Before our text
[3970.44 --> 3972.90]  Explaining to the Pharisees
[3972.90 --> 3973.32]  And the people
[3973.32 --> 3974.26]  Who come out to him
[3974.26 --> 3975.06]  He says
[3975.06 --> 3976.02]  After me
[3976.02 --> 3977.06]  Comes one
[3977.06 --> 3978.14]  Who is more powerful
[3978.14 --> 3978.78]  Than I
[3978.78 --> 3980.66]  He will baptize you
[3980.66 --> 3981.58]  With the Holy Spirit
[3981.58 --> 3982.72]  And fire
[3982.72 --> 3984.54]  John knows
[3984.54 --> 3985.18]  That he needs
[3985.18 --> 3985.74]  The baptism
[3985.74 --> 3986.58]  Of the Holy Spirit
[3986.58 --> 3987.84]  In order to escape
[3987.84 --> 3989.30]  The baptism by fire
[3989.30 --> 3990.30]  Right
[3990.30 --> 3991.16]  Which the next verse
[3991.16 --> 3991.94]  Tells us
[3991.94 --> 3992.98]  Is the judgment
[3992.98 --> 3993.50]  That comes
[3993.50 --> 3994.56]  From rejecting Jesus
[3994.56 --> 3995.44]  In verse 12
[3995.44 --> 3997.06]  He will clear
[3997.06 --> 3998.12]  His threshing floor
[3998.12 --> 3999.08]  Gathering his wheat
[3999.08 --> 3999.78]  Into the barn
[3999.78 --> 4000.76]  And burning up
[4000.76 --> 4001.48]  The chaff
[4001.48 --> 4002.62]  With unquenchable
[4002.62 --> 4003.44]  Fire
[4003.44 --> 4005.24]  Right
[4005.24 --> 4006.00]  Jesus comes
[4006.00 --> 4006.84]  To baptize
[4006.84 --> 4007.74]  With the Holy Spirit
[4007.74 --> 4008.82]  And bring salvation
[4008.82 --> 4009.96]  And he comes
[4009.96 --> 4010.90]  To bring judgment
[4010.90 --> 4012.30]  On those who reject him
[4012.30 --> 4012.96]  And on those
[4012.96 --> 4013.90]  Who've rejected God
[4013.90 --> 4015.28]  Those who haven't
[4015.28 --> 4016.10]  Produced fruit
[4016.10 --> 4017.32]  In keeping with repentance
[4017.32 --> 4017.96]  Because
[4017.96 --> 4019.14]  They're chaff
[4019.14 --> 4019.98]  It turns out
[4019.98 --> 4022.18]  Now hearing
[4022.18 --> 4022.90]  John's doubts
[4022.90 --> 4024.04]  And concerns
[4024.04 --> 4025.78]  Jesus says
[4025.78 --> 4027.76]  Let it be so now
[4027.76 --> 4029.64]  It's proper for us
[4029.64 --> 4030.26]  To do this
[4030.26 --> 4031.26]  To fulfill
[4031.26 --> 4032.48]  All righteousness
[4032.48 --> 4034.60]  Because
[4034.60 --> 4035.58]  John is right
[4035.58 --> 4036.90]  Jesus doesn't need
[4036.90 --> 4037.62]  To repent
[4037.62 --> 4038.60]  He doesn't need
[4038.60 --> 4039.42]  To confess
[4039.42 --> 4040.38]  Any way
[4040.38 --> 4041.22]  That his life
[4041.22 --> 4042.22]  Isn't perfectly
[4042.22 --> 4042.86]  In line
[4042.86 --> 4043.82]  With God's will
[4043.82 --> 4044.90]  Jesus' life
[4044.90 --> 4045.74]  Is perfectly
[4045.74 --> 4046.32]  Aligned
[4046.32 --> 4047.36]  With God's will
[4047.36 --> 4048.56]  He is already
[4048.56 --> 4049.30]  Perfectly
[4049.30 --> 4050.26]  Righteous
[4050.26 --> 4051.28]  And yet
[4051.28 --> 4052.20]  To use John's
[4052.20 --> 4053.32]  Own language
[4053.32 --> 4054.30]  That means
[4054.30 --> 4055.56]  He is producing
[4055.56 --> 4056.42]  The fruit
[4056.42 --> 4057.20]  In keeping
[4057.20 --> 4058.60]  With repentance
[4058.60 --> 4059.78]  He's living
[4059.78 --> 4060.68]  The fruit
[4060.68 --> 4061.96]  Of righteousness
[4061.96 --> 4062.96]  Right
[4062.96 --> 4063.42]  The fruit
[4063.42 --> 4064.22]  Of repentance
[4064.22 --> 4065.76]  Is righteousness
[4065.76 --> 4066.96]  Living obedient
[4066.96 --> 4067.84]  To God's will
[4067.84 --> 4069.62]  And to fulfill
[4069.62 --> 4070.66]  All righteousness
[4070.66 --> 4071.18]  Then
[4071.18 --> 4072.90]  Jesus demonstrates
[4072.90 --> 4073.98]  The connection
[4073.98 --> 4075.20]  Between baptism
[4075.20 --> 4076.66]  And obedience
[4076.66 --> 4078.28]  And then he invites
[4078.28 --> 4079.00]  Us all
[4079.00 --> 4080.34]  Into that same
[4080.34 --> 4082.14]  Baptismal obedience
[4082.14 --> 4083.82]  The contrast
[4083.82 --> 4084.80]  In this text
[4084.80 --> 4086.08]  Here isn't
[4086.08 --> 4087.02]  Between John's
[4087.02 --> 4087.60]  Baptism
[4087.60 --> 4088.48]  And Jesus'
[4088.66 --> 4089.18]  Baptism
[4089.18 --> 4089.92]  That's what
[4089.92 --> 4090.86]  Sometimes people
[4090.86 --> 4091.28]  Think
[4091.28 --> 4092.20]  The contrast
[4092.20 --> 4092.84]  Actually is
[4092.84 --> 4093.78]  Between John
[4093.78 --> 4094.64]  And Jesus
[4094.64 --> 4096.58]  Between servant
[4096.58 --> 4097.58]  And master
[4097.58 --> 4099.04]  Right
[4099.04 --> 4099.52]  Elsewhere
[4099.52 --> 4100.22]  John says
[4100.22 --> 4101.24]  He must become
[4101.24 --> 4101.66]  Greater
[4101.66 --> 4102.66]  I must become
[4102.66 --> 4103.06]  Less
[4103.06 --> 4104.32]  And this is
[4104.32 --> 4105.04]  The same idea
[4105.04 --> 4106.98]  The form of
[4106.98 --> 4108.50]  Baptism is the same
[4108.50 --> 4109.52]  Right
[4109.52 --> 4110.32]  John's baptism
[4110.32 --> 4111.16]  Was no dead
[4111.16 --> 4111.72]  Sign
[4111.72 --> 4113.78]  His was the role
[4113.78 --> 4114.78]  Of a minister
[4114.78 --> 4115.80]  Of an outward
[4115.80 --> 4116.36]  Sign
[4116.36 --> 4117.48]  Where Christ
[4117.48 --> 4118.66]  Is the author
[4118.66 --> 4120.42]  Of a spiritual
[4120.42 --> 4121.54]  Sign
[4121.54 --> 4122.74]  A spiritual act
[4122.74 --> 4123.34]  A spiritual
[4123.34 --> 4124.36]  Baptism
[4124.36 --> 4125.16]  Spiritual meaning
[4125.16 --> 4126.18]  Spirit filled
[4126.18 --> 4127.06]  And fueled
[4127.06 --> 4128.54]  Right
[4128.54 --> 4129.34]  It's the sign
[4129.34 --> 4130.22]  And the thing
[4130.22 --> 4131.38]  Signified
[4131.38 --> 4132.66]  Ministers
[4132.66 --> 4133.44]  Like John
[4133.44 --> 4134.28]  And like me
[4134.28 --> 4134.96]  For that matter
[4134.96 --> 4136.12]  Do the sign
[4136.12 --> 4137.80]  It is Christ
[4137.80 --> 4138.54]  Who brings
[4138.54 --> 4139.30]  The reality
[4139.30 --> 4140.74]  It is Christ
[4140.74 --> 4141.36]  Who brings
[4141.36 --> 4142.28]  The real
[4142.28 --> 4143.24]  By the spirit
[4143.24 --> 4145.56]  And in the same
[4145.56 --> 4145.98]  Way
[4145.98 --> 4146.94]  Christ was
[4146.94 --> 4147.74]  Baptized
[4147.74 --> 4148.94]  We are
[4148.94 --> 4149.94]  Baptized
[4149.94 --> 4151.10]  When enjoined
[4151.10 --> 4151.78]  To him
[4151.78 --> 4152.70]  By the spirit
[4152.70 --> 4155.12]  John Calvin
[4155.12 --> 4156.88]  Who's a
[4156.88 --> 4158.78]  16th century
[4158.78 --> 4159.98]  French pastor
[4159.98 --> 4160.72]  Who lived
[4160.72 --> 4161.16]  And worked
[4161.16 --> 4161.86]  Mostly in
[4161.86 --> 4162.52]  Geneva
[4162.52 --> 4163.16]  Switzerland
[4163.16 --> 4163.88]  He's really
[4163.88 --> 4164.38]  Beautiful
[4164.38 --> 4165.58]  In his
[4165.58 --> 4166.10]  Commentary
[4166.10 --> 4166.52]  On this
[4166.52 --> 4166.82]  Point
[4166.82 --> 4168.26]  He says
[4168.26 --> 4169.52]  He
[4169.52 --> 4170.38]  That is Christ
[4170.38 --> 4171.08]  Received
[4171.08 --> 4171.82]  The same
[4171.82 --> 4172.38]  Baptism
[4172.38 --> 4172.94]  With us
[4172.94 --> 4173.46]  In order
[4173.46 --> 4174.22]  To assure
[4174.22 --> 4174.94]  Believers
[4174.94 --> 4175.58]  That they
[4175.58 --> 4176.46]  Are grafted
[4176.46 --> 4177.08]  Into his
[4177.08 --> 4177.48]  Body
[4177.48 --> 4178.28]  And that
[4178.28 --> 4178.88]  They are
[4178.88 --> 4179.32]  And he's
[4179.32 --> 4179.84]  Quoting from
[4179.84 --> 4180.76]  Romans 6
[4180.76 --> 4181.30]  Verse 4
[4181.30 --> 4181.56]  Now
[4181.56 --> 4182.26]  They are
[4182.26 --> 4182.76]  Buried
[4182.76 --> 4183.16]  With him
[4183.16 --> 4183.76]  In baptism
[4183.76 --> 4184.54]  That they
[4184.54 --> 4185.20]  May rise
[4185.20 --> 4186.04]  To newness
[4186.04 --> 4187.10]  Of life
[4187.10 --> 4188.92]  Right
[4188.92 --> 4189.40]  Christ's
[4189.40 --> 4190.00]  Baptism
[4190.00 --> 4191.24]  To fulfill
[4191.24 --> 4192.10]  All righteousness
[4192.10 --> 4193.32]  Is to assure
[4193.32 --> 4193.78]  You
[4193.78 --> 4194.64]  In your
[4194.64 --> 4195.44]  Baptism
[4195.44 --> 4196.26]  In the
[4196.26 --> 4196.94]  Holy Spirit
[4196.94 --> 4197.88]  As a
[4197.88 --> 4198.26]  Fruit
[4198.26 --> 4199.02]  In keeping
[4199.02 --> 4199.86]  With repentance
[4199.86 --> 4201.62]  Again
[4201.62 --> 4202.38]  Calvin says
[4202.38 --> 4203.00]  It beautifully
[4203.00 --> 4203.48]  He says
[4203.48 --> 4204.50]  That the
[4204.50 --> 4205.50]  General reason
[4205.50 --> 4206.52]  Christ received
[4206.52 --> 4207.10]  Baptism
[4207.10 --> 4207.60]  Was that he
[4207.60 --> 4208.20]  Might render
[4208.20 --> 4209.12]  Full obedience
[4209.12 --> 4209.50]  To the
[4209.50 --> 4209.82]  Father
[4209.82 --> 4211.00]  And the
[4211.00 --> 4211.56]  Special
[4211.56 --> 4212.16]  Reason
[4212.16 --> 4213.08]  Was that he
[4213.08 --> 4214.14]  Might consecrate
[4214.14 --> 4215.14]  Baptism in his
[4215.14 --> 4215.84]  Own body
[4215.84 --> 4216.88]  That we might
[4216.88 --> 4217.54]  Have it in
[4217.54 --> 4218.24]  Common with
[4218.24 --> 4218.48]  Him
[4218.48 --> 4222.42]  And so
[4222.42 --> 4222.82]  Let's take
[4222.82 --> 4223.44]  This idea
[4223.44 --> 4225.44]  And tie it
[4225.44 --> 4225.78]  To what
[4225.78 --> 4226.92]  Actually happens
[4226.92 --> 4228.06]  When Jesus
[4228.06 --> 4228.86]  Is baptized
[4228.86 --> 4230.88]  Because when
[4230.88 --> 4231.48]  Jesus is
[4231.48 --> 4232.12]  Baptized
[4232.12 --> 4232.86]  Heaven opens
[4232.86 --> 4233.24]  Up
[4233.24 --> 4233.84]  And the
[4233.84 --> 4234.22]  Spirit
[4234.22 --> 4234.92]  Descends
[4234.92 --> 4235.44]  Like a
[4235.44 --> 4235.94]  Dove
[4235.94 --> 4236.52]  A
[4236.52 --> 4237.04]  Lighting
[4237.04 --> 4237.54]  On him
[4237.54 --> 4238.00]  We read
[4238.00 --> 4238.54]  And the
[4238.54 --> 4239.02]  Voice
[4239.02 --> 4239.84]  From the
[4239.84 --> 4240.28]  Father
[4240.28 --> 4241.00]  Speaks
[4241.00 --> 4241.60]  This
[4241.60 --> 4242.48]  Is my
[4242.48 --> 4243.14]  Son
[4243.14 --> 4243.80]  Whom
[4243.80 --> 4244.04]  I
[4244.04 --> 4244.48]  Love
[4244.48 --> 4244.92]  With
[4244.92 --> 4245.34]  Him
[4245.34 --> 4245.70]  I
[4245.70 --> 4246.00]  Am
[4246.00 --> 4246.30]  Well
[4246.30 --> 4246.84]  Pleased
[4246.84 --> 4248.76]  In a
[4248.76 --> 4249.24]  Special
[4249.24 --> 4249.64]  Way
[4249.64 --> 4249.96]  That
[4249.96 --> 4250.42]  Truth
[4250.42 --> 4250.96]  Belongs
[4250.96 --> 4251.22]  To
[4251.22 --> 4251.64]  Jesus
[4251.64 --> 4252.32]  He
[4252.32 --> 4252.96]  Is the
[4252.96 --> 4253.32]  Only
[4253.32 --> 4253.96]  Begotten
[4253.96 --> 4254.32]  Of the
[4254.32 --> 4254.62]  Father
[4254.62 --> 4255.18]  He
[4255.18 --> 4255.80]  Is the
[4255.80 --> 4256.08]  Son
[4256.08 --> 4256.56]  Of God
[4256.56 --> 4256.76]  Who
[4256.76 --> 4256.98]  Took
[4256.98 --> 4257.52]  On flesh
[4257.52 --> 4257.90]  And made
[4257.90 --> 4258.06]  His
[4258.06 --> 4258.38]  Dwelling
[4258.38 --> 4259.18]  Among us
[4259.18 --> 4259.72]  In him
[4259.72 --> 4260.26]  Alone
[4260.26 --> 4260.70]  Does the
[4260.70 --> 4261.12]  Fullness
[4261.12 --> 4261.82]  Of the
[4261.82 --> 4262.30]  Deity
[4262.30 --> 4262.76]  Dwell
[4262.76 --> 4263.38]  In a
[4263.38 --> 4263.72]  Special
[4263.72 --> 4264.08]  Way
[4264.08 --> 4264.54]  Jesus
[4264.54 --> 4265.32]  Is the
[4265.32 --> 4265.70]  Son
[4265.70 --> 4266.34]  Of
[4266.34 --> 4266.96]  God
[4266.96 --> 4267.12]  And
[4267.12 --> 4267.46]  Actually
[4267.46 --> 4267.84]  This
[4267.84 --> 4268.48]  Verse
[4268.48 --> 4269.16]  Is
[4269.16 --> 4269.78]  Essential
[4269.78 --> 4270.38]  In the
[4270.38 --> 4270.76]  History
[4270.76 --> 4271.16]  Of the
[4271.16 --> 4271.48]  Christian
[4271.48 --> 4271.88]  Church
[4271.88 --> 4272.36]  To
[4272.36 --> 4273.00]  Clarifying
[4273.00 --> 4273.48]  All sorts
[4273.48 --> 4273.62]  Of
[4273.62 --> 4274.26]  Disagreements
[4274.26 --> 4274.50]  And
[4274.50 --> 4275.08]  Heresies
[4275.08 --> 4275.48]  About the
[4275.48 --> 4275.64]  Two
[4275.64 --> 4275.94]  Natures
[4275.94 --> 4276.10]  Of

[4277.04 --> 4277.20]  The
[4277.20 --> 4277.44]  Trinity
[4277.44 --> 4277.88]  But
[4277.88 --> 4278.06]  We
[4278.06 --> 4278.20]  Don't
[4278.20 --> 4278.30]  Have
[4278.30 --> 4278.50]  Time

[4280.40 --> 4280.88]  Profound
[4280.88 --> 4282.54]  In a
[4282.54 --> 4282.84]  Special

[4283.16 --> 4283.62]  Jesus
[4283.62 --> 4284.14]  Is
[4284.14 --> 4284.34]  The
[4284.34 --> 4284.54]  Son
[4284.54 --> 4284.70]  Of
[4284.70 --> 4284.96]  God

[4288.64 --> 4288.82]  A
[4288.82 --> 4289.22]  General
[4289.22 --> 4289.66]  Way
[4289.66 --> 4290.20]  We
