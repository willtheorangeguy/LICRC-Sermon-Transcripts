[0.00 → 1.58] I know that we are.
[2.48 → 7.00] And God has just amazingly moved during the time of prayer and worship.
[7.74 → 13.50] And I think that's what some of the people in this room saw when they saw us play live.
[15.06 → 17.22] And just want to encourage us to do more of that.
[17.40 → 18.78] God is blessing something.
[20.10 → 21.34] Hey, let's grab onto it.
[21.92 → 23.40] This life is too short.
[23.58 → 29.16] It's too complicated for us to worry about things that we want to do.
[30.00 → 32.00] All we want to do is go out, my God.
[33.40 → 39.20] When Joey came to us about to do the Praise album, it was supposed to be his two or three song things.
[40.28 → 41.18] I thought that was cool.
[41.90 → 44.64] And then they had a meeting with Alan.
[44.84 → 48.74] Alan made some comments about, well, I'll do a ten song thing.
[48.80 → 49.38] I'll be into that.
[49.38 → 50.26] And then he came.
[50.84 → 51.46] Then he was excited.
[51.58 → 52.60] He called us up and decided about it.
[54.46 → 56.06] We thought they all lost it.
[56.06 → 61.84] We had a meeting before we went to go tea to meet to make sure we were all going to stand together and say no to the ten song.
[63.28 → 64.38] We had bars and nobles.
[64.52 → 66.68] And we were about to come be able to think about, guys, we've got to stick together on this.
[66.76 → 68.08] And they'll believe in what we're trying to do.
[68.18 → 70.70] They're just going to try to make some praise band and all this stuff.
[71.70 → 73.54] And God just flipped us upside down.
[73.54 → 83.72] And as a prelude, if tomorrow this whole album falls to pieces for some reason, at the very least, God has brought me back to a place where I was four years ago.
[83.80 → 84.92] I was excited about servanthood.
[85.42 → 87.10] I didn't care about where I was going in the world.
[87.76 → 90.08] At the very least, my marriage is stronger.
[90.54 → 91.60] My relationship with God is stronger.
[92.08 → 94.50] And if all this goes tomorrow, praise God.
[94.50 → 99.10] I'm so happy that you used whatever is happening right now in all our lives to bring me this point.
[124.50 → 148.50] There is a truth older than the ages.
[148.50 → 154.46] There is a promise of things yet to come.
[155.46 → 160.92] There is one born for our salvation.
[162.76 → 164.00] Jesus.
[167.26 → 173.42] There is a light that overwhelms the darkness.
[173.42 → 179.80] There is a kingdom that forever reigns.
[180.38 → 187.18] There is freedom from the chains that bind us.
[187.76 → 189.00] Jesus.
[190.92 → 192.08] Jesus.
[192.08 → 196.62] Who walks on the waters.
[196.62 → 199.62] Who speaks to the sea.
[200.00 → 205.22] Who stands in the fire beside me.
[206.10 → 208.98] He roars like a lion.
[209.26 → 212.12] He bled as the lamb.
[212.62 → 218.04] He carries my healing in His hands.
[218.04 → 220.16] Jesus
[220.16 → 229.56] There is a name I call in times of trouble
[229.56 → 235.78] There is a song that comforts in the night
[235.78 → 242.18] There is a voice that calms a storm that rages
[242.18 → 248.24] He is Jesus, Jesus
[248.24 → 255.72] Who walks on the waters, who speaks to the sea
[255.72 → 261.38] Who stands in the fire beside me
[261.38 → 268.24] He roars like a lion, He bread as a lamb
[268.24 → 273.82] He carries my healing in His name
[273.82 → 276.26] Jesus
[276.26 → 282.30] Messiah
[282.30 → 285.46] My Saviour
[285.46 → 292.18] There is power in Your name
[292.18 → 298.02] You're my rocket, my redeemer
[298.02 → 304.62] There is power in Your name
[304.62 → 307.34] In Your name
[307.34 → 314.90] You walk on the waters
[314.90 → 317.94] You speak to the sea
[317.94 → 323.48] You stand in the fire beside me
[323.48 → 327.38] You roar like a lion
[327.38 → 330.56] You blend as a lamb
[330.56 → 335.84] You carry my healing in Your hands
[335.84 → 339.86] God, You walk on the waters
[339.86 → 342.90] You speak to the sea
[342.90 → 348.44] You stand in the fire beside me
[348.44 → 352.30] You roar like a lion
[352.30 → 355.52] You lay as a lamb
[355.52 → 361.60] You carry my healing in Your hands
[361.60 → 363.46] Jesus
[363.46 → 363.50] Jesus
[363.50 → 368.70] There is no one like You
[368.70 → 369.82] Jesus
[369.82 → 375.38] There is no one like You
[375.38 → 379.82] Jesus
[379.82 → 381.82] Jesus
[381.82 → 391.58] There is no one like You
[391.58 → 392.28] Jesus
[392.28 → 410.80] Here we stand, here we are
[410.80 → 414.12] With all our wounds and battle scars
[414.12 → 417.84] From all the storms and all the wars
[417.84 → 422.32] together
[422.32 → 431.32] we had no way of knowing when
[431.32 → 434.72] we started way back there and then
[434.72 → 438.34] how the road would twist and turn and bend
[438.34 → 440.88] we just knew we belonged
[440.88 → 442.88] together
[447.84 → 454.84] and if it wasn't for god's mercy and his grace
[454.84 → 461.84] there's no way we would be standing in this place
[461.84 → 470.84] but because he has been faithful every step along the way
[470.84 → 475.84] here we are
[475.84 → 482.84] together
[482.84 → 485.84] we've climbed up mountains higher than
[485.84 → 489.84] we're ever in our hopes and plans
[489.84 → 492.84] we've held on to each other's hand
[492.84 → 496.84] watched miracles unfold
[496.84 → 503.84] together
[503.84 → 509.84] we've crawled on our hands and knees through valleys cold and dark and deep
[509.84 → 516.84] and we're not even sure if we can make it out alive together
[516.84 → 523.84] together
[523.84 → 529.84] and if it wasn't for god's mercy and his grace
[529.84 → 533.84] there's no way we would be standing in this place
[533.84 → 536.84] we're not even sure if we can make it out of this place
[536.84 → 540.84] but because he has been free for every step along the way
[540.84 → 541.84] step along the way
[541.84 → 547.84] here we are
[547.84 → 550.84] together
[550.84 → 555.84] together
[555.84 → 556.84] together
[556.84 → 558.84] together
[558.84 → 562.84] together
[562.84 → 565.84] together
[565.84 → 569.84] together
[569.84 → 570.84] together
[570.84 → 573.84] together
[573.84 → 575.84] together
[575.84 → 583.84] and
[583.84 → 590.84] Because he has been faithful every step along the way.
[590.84 → 597.84] Here be the Lord.
[597.84 → 604.84] Together.
[604.84 → 611.84] Together.
[613.84 → 615.84] Together.
[615.84 → 617.84] Together.
[625.84 → 635.84] In the last three of them.
[635.84 → 653.52] Let me take a look at what it is.
[653.52 → 660.52] So why would I let worries spill my breath?
[660.52 → 664.52] Even the roses
[664.52 → 669.52] You have clothed in brilliant red
[669.52 → 676.52] Still I'm the one you love more than this
[676.52 → 680.52] You give me everything
[680.52 → 684.52] You give me everything
[684.52 → 691.52] You give me everything I need

[702.52 → 706.52] You give me everything I need
[706.52 → 713.52] Even the oceans
[713.52 → 717.52] Push and pull at your command
[717.52 → 724.52] So you can still my heart with your head
[724.52 → 728.52] You tell the seasons
[728.52 → 733.52] When it's time for them to turn
[733.52 → 739.52] So I would trust you even when it hurts
[739.52 → 743.52] You give me everything
[743.52 → 747.52] You give me everything
[747.52 → 750.52] You give me everything
[750.52 → 751.52] You give me everything
[751.52 → 753.52] You give me everything
[754.52 → 755.52] You give me everything
[755.52 → 766.40] I need you give me everything you give me everything
[766.40 → 772.40] you give me everything
[774.64 → 784.80] when I can't see you lead me when I can't hear you show me when I can't stand
[784.80 → 787.52] you carry me
[790.96 → 799.68] when I'm lost you will find me when I'm with you are mighty

[862.96 → 867.68] you give me everything
[867.68 → 874.40] you give me everything

[878.40 → 880.40] you the way
[880.40 → 882.40] you give me everything
[882.40 → 884.40] You
[912.40 → 921.40] you are everything I know fails to compare to you and you alone
[921.40 → 933.40] taken by your majesty I am overcome by the power of what your hand has done
[933.40 → 940.40] yeah I can never quite express the beauty of your holiness
[940.40 → 945.40] you're the holy one
[945.40 → 951.40] I can never quite define the way you change this heart of mine
[951.40 → 956.40] you're the holy one
[956.40 → 961.40] you're the holy one
[961.40 → 965.40] you're the holy one
[970.40 → 978.40] there's no counting all the ways
[978.40 → 981.40] you and men so true
[981.40 → 983.40] faithful to the end
[983.40 → 986.40] you're faithful through and through
[986.40 → 989.40] you are more than wonderful
[989.40 → 992.40] you are everything
[992.40 → 994.40] you mean more than love
[994.40 → 998.40] more than life to me
[998.40 → 1000.40] yeah
[1000.40 → 1004.40] I can never quite express the beauty of your holiness
[1004.40 → 1005.40] you
[1005.40 → 1007.40] you
[1007.40 → 1009.40] you
[1009.40 → 1011.40] you
[1011.40 → 1014.40] you
[1014.40 → 1016.40] you
[1016.40 → 1018.40] you
[1018.40 → 1020.40] you
[1020.40 → 1022.40] you
[1022.40 → 1024.40] you
[1024.40 → 1026.40] you
[1026.40 → 1039.40] you
[1039.40 → 1041.40] you
[1041.40 → 1043.40] you
[1043.40 → 1058.40] you
[1073.40 → 1086.40] you
[1086.40 → 1088.40] you
[1103.40 → 1116.40] you
[1116.40 → 1117.40] you
[1117.40 → 1118.40] you
[1118.40 → 1120.40] you
[1120.40 → 1122.40] you
[1122.40 → 1124.40] you
[1124.40 → 1127.40] you
[1127.40 → 1143.40] you
[1143.40 → 1143.72] you
[1143.72 → 1146.40] you
[1146.40 → 1147.40] you
[1147.40 → 1153.82] to hear from our cadets and their counsellors and learn about what they've been up to in this past
[1153.82 → 1161.06] year and to share this service of celebration and worship with them. As we gather here for
[1161.06 → 1166.16] worship at Emanuel, we've got a couple announcements that we want to just put out in front of you.
[1167.06 → 1174.26] And so the first is just a big thank you to everyone who participated in the coldest night
[1174.26 → 1182.56] of the year walk yesterday or who donated in support of that. We are at Emanuel $600 away from
[1182.56 → 1189.94] our goal of $3,000 in fundraising for that. So if you are looking for an opportunity to fundraise
[1189.94 → 1196.72] for something, you can find the link to donate still open today and into next week in the e-bulletins
[1196.72 → 1205.96] and midweek memos and things like that. Also, tonight is 2020 for the youth in our youth program.
[1206.08 → 1210.12] If you have any questions about that, Pastor Kevin will happily address them for you.
[1211.22 → 1218.32] And then next Saturday is worship at Sun ridge. And so Sun ridge is a retirement to seniors living
[1218.32 → 1223.46] facility up the hill. We send a group there on the first Saturday of every month to worship with some
[1223.46 → 1229.34] of the residents there. That's happening this coming Saturday at 2 o'clock. And everyone is invited to
[1229.34 → 1238.34] join and to gather with those who worship there. And then lastly, Mexico mission team is looking for
[1238.34 → 1245.70] a few volunteers to drop off at the airport and then pick up 10 days later. And so if you're willing
[1245.70 → 1254.18] to drive to Seattle SeaT ac on the 15th, leaving here at 5 a.m., they would love that. And so would you.
[1255.98 → 1263.46] And if you're willing or some others of you are willing to drive on the 25th to Seattle SeaT ac for
[1263.46 → 1269.52] 5 p.m., that would be excellent. If you are willing to do that, you can either talk to myself or Kevin
[1269.52 → 1276.48] or Brandon, and we'll get you those details and particulars there. But think about that. It would be great
[1276.48 → 1284.36] if we could get, I think we're going to need two, probably even three vans this year going. So let's be mindful
[1284.36 → 1291.36] of that. I think that's it for announcements. I'm getting one nod saying that's it. So I'm going to invite you as you are
[1291.36 → 1299.02] able to stand, and we're going to come into God's presence in worship and in song, in prayer and in word this morning.
[1299.20 → 1305.96] And so I'm going to invite you to receive God's blessing as we meet him in this place together.
[1306.34 → 1308.64] Receive the blessing of our God this morning in worship.
[1310.08 → 1317.66] Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, Son, and our Saviour,
[1317.66 → 1321.90] through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[1322.42 → 1325.34] I'm going to invite you to turn to those around you and welcome them into worship this morning.
[1325.34 → 1325.38] Amen.
[1347.66 → 1365.62] Good morning. Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 92.
[1365.62 → 1374.94] It is good to praise the Lord and make music to your name, O Most High, proclaiming your love
[1374.94 → 1383.78] in the morning and your faithfulness at night. Cadets and all here and online, let us all join
[1383.78 → 1390.06] our voices with God's family here as we sing of his love and his faithfulness.
[1390.06 → 1420.04] In my wrestling and in my downfall,
[1420.04 → 1428.54] In my failure, you won't walk out. Your great love will lead me through.
[1429.32 → 1437.16] You are the peace in my troubled sea. You are the peace in my troubled sea.
[1439.94 → 1448.20] In the silence, you won't let go. In the questions, your truth will hold.
[1448.20 → 1456.64] Your great love will lead me through. You are the peace in my troubled sea.
[1456.64 → 1475.64] My lighthouse, my lighthouse, shining in the darkness. I will follow you, O My Lighthouse, My Lighthouse.
[1475.64 → 1481.64] I will trust the promise. You will carry me safe to shore.
[1481.64 → 1493.64] Safe to shore. Safe to shore. Safe to shore. Safe to shore.
[1493.64 → 1505.14] I won't fear. I won't fear what tomorrow brings. With each morning, I'll rise and sing.
[1505.14 → 1513.64] My God's love will lead me through. You are the peace in my troubled sea.
[1513.64 → 1525.64] My lighthouse, my lighthouse, my lighthouse. My lighthouse, my lighthouse.
[1525.64 → 1542.64] I will trust the promise. You will carry me safe to shore. Safe to shore.
[1542.64 → 1550.64] Safe to shore. Safe to shore. Safe to shore.
[1554.64 → 1562.64] Fire before us. You're the brightest. You will lead us through the storm.
[1562.64 → 1578.64] Fire before us. You will lead us through the storm.
[1578.64 → 1580.64] Fire before us. You're the brightest. You will lead us through the storm.
[1580.64 → 1590.64] Fire before us. You're the brightest. It is, O My Lighthouse.
[1590.64 → 1596.64] Fire before us. You are the brightest. You are the brightest.
[1596.64 → 1602.64] Fire before us. In the flowers.
[1602.64 → 1604.64] Fire before us.
[1604.64 → 1608.64] Fire before us.
[1608.64 → 1610.64] safe to show.
[1638.64 → 1652.24] My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[1654.24 → 1667.24] I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly trust in Jesus' name.
[1668.64 → 1684.74] My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[1684.74 → 1699.74] I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly trust in Jesus' name.
[1699.74 → 1701.74] Amen.
[1701.74 → 1716.74] Christ alone, cornerstone, weak made strong in the Saviour's love.
[1716.74 → 1728.74] Through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all.
[1728.74 → 1746.74] When darkness seems to hide His face, I rest on His unchanging grace.
[1746.74 → 1760.74] In every high and stormy game, my anger holds within the veil.
[1760.74 → 1768.74] My anger holds within the veil.
[1768.74 → 1783.74] Christ alone, cornerstone, weak made strong in the Saviour's love.
[1783.74 → 1795.74] Through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all.
[1795.74 → 1813.74] When He shall come with trumpet sound, O may I there in Him be found.
[1813.74 → 1820.74] Dressed in His righteousness alone,
[1820.74 → 1821.74] Dressed in His righteousness alone,
[1821.74 → 1828.74] Faultless stand before the throne.
[1828.74 → 1843.74] Christ alone, cornerstone, weak made strong in the Saviour's love.
[1843.74 → 1855.74] Through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all.
[1855.74 → 1870.74] Christ alone, cornerstone, weak made strong in the Saviour's love.
[1870.74 → 1883.74] Through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all.
[1883.74 → 1885.74] You may be seated.
[1885.74 → 1886.74] Invite Andrew up.
[1886.74 → 1888.74] Good morning.
[1888.74 → 1911.74] My name is Andrew Rucksack, and I'm the leader of the Cadet Group here at Langley Emanuel.
[1911.74 → 1917.74] I'm just going to start off this morning by sharing a little bit about what the Cadets have been up to this year.
[1917.74 → 1926.74] First off, this year our Cadet Group consists of 29 boys, with about half of those boys coming from outside our local church community.
[1926.74 → 1938.74] On a typical Cadet evening, we always start with our Cadet landmarks, which we'll be going through in a few moments with the boys, followed by a time of devotion, some games, and some sort of project.
[1938.74 → 1943.74] We end each meeting with singing Living for Jesus.
[1943.74 → 1948.74] Some of the special evenings that we've done this year so far, we did a pumpkin carving evening.
[1948.74 → 1955.74] We also went to an ice hockey game for Trinity Western, and we've got a few more things planned before the end of the year.
[1955.74 → 1965.74] Some of the projects the boys have been working on this year include propeller cars, a mini disc golf game, mousetrap cars, and they're currently working on a pencil box.
[1965.74 → 1972.74] In the coming weeks, we're also going to be making model rockets with the boys that we'll be launching off at the end of the year.
[1972.74 → 1977.74] If you're interested, you can check out some of these projects on the table in the foyer after the service.
[1977.74 → 1986.74] For devotions this year, we've been looking at our theme for Cadets, which is Lead the Way, which is based off of 1 Timothy 4, verse 12.
[1986.74 → 1987.74] That reads,
[1987.74 → 1996.74] Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity.
[1996.74 → 2003.74] So through our time of devotion, each meeting, the Cadets have been learning how to combine leading the way with their living for Jesus,
[2003.74 → 2006.74] by trying to set an example for others in all areas of their life.
[2006.74 → 2013.74] More specifically, we've been discussing how they can lead the way by setting an example in the words that they use,
[2013.74 → 2021.74] their actions towards others, showing love through service, being examples of faith, and by having hearts and minds that are kept pure.
[2021.74 → 2025.74] So that's just a little bit about what we've been up to this year.
[2025.74 → 2030.74] At this time, I'm going to be going through the landmarks with the Cadets.
[2030.74 → 2034.74] So I think I'm going to come down in front of you guys here.
[2034.74 → 2038.74] I'm going to ask the Cadets and the leaders to stand.
[2041.74 → 2043.74] All right, Cadets, attention.
[2043.74 → 2047.74] Cadets, what is your motto?
[2047.74 → 2051.74] Cadets, what is your verse?
[2051.74 → 2053.74] Cadets?
[2054.74 → 2058.74] Cadets, what is your noun?
[2058.74 → 2060.74] Cadets, what IS your code?
[2077.74 → 2080.74] Cadets, what IS your pledge?
[2080.74 → 2098.46] All right, thank you.
[2098.46 → 2099.24] You can have a seat.
[2099.24 → 2117.00] Next, I'll be leading everyone through a responsive reading, which should be up on the screen.
[2117.00 → 2119.00] Hopefully.
[2119.00 → 2122.66] Okay.
[2122.66 → 2124.62] This year's cadet theme is Lead the Way.
[2124.62 → 2128.82] The cadets are learning how God directs and trains them as leaders.
[2128.82 → 2150.58] Cadets must be an example in Christian speech.
[2150.58 → 2154.52] Cadets must be an example in their Christian conduct.

[2232.52 → 2234.52] Cadets must be an example of a Christian faith in all areas of life.
[2234.52 → 2254.52] Cadets must be an example of a Christian faith in all areas of life.
[2254.52 → 2258.44] I'll let any of the values that we've heard of.
[2259.06 → 2262.40] Let's set an example to the leaders in speech,
[2262.90 → 2266.56] honour, love, and faith, and truth.
[2266.56 → 2270.56] Let's set an example to the leaders in speech, honour, and love.
[2270.56 → 2285.86] Why don't we stand together and offer a few more songs to go.
[2300.56 → 2330.54] Let's set an example to the leaders in speech, honour, and faith, and truth.
[2330.56 → 2360.54] Let's set an example to the leaders in speech, honour, and faith, and truth.
[2360.54 → 2365.50] And in all I do bring you honour and faith.
[2365.82 → 2373.72] How I love you, great and mighty King.
[2373.72 → 2383.56] You are faithful through the ages you never changed.
[2383.56 → 2389.56] Be my guide for the road ahead.
[2389.72 → 2394.02] Should I feel this way, you are just and good.
[2395.02 → 2402.70] I want to trust in you, and in all I do bring you honour and faith.
[2402.70 → 2410.94] How I love you, great and mighty King.

[2466.86 → 2472.38] Over all the earth you reign on high
[2472.38 → 2476.84] Every mountain stream, every sunset sky
[2476.84 → 2482.20] But my one request, Lord my only aim
[2482.20 → 2485.76] Is that you reign in me again
[2485.76 → 2490.30] Lord reign in me, reign in your power
[2490.30 → 2494.84] Over all my dreams, in my darkest hour
[2494.84 → 2500.10] You are the Lord of all I am
[2500.10 → 2503.84] So won't you reign in me again
[2503.84 → 2517.22] Over every thought, over every word
[2517.22 → 2521.58] May my life reflect the beauty of my Lord
[2521.58 → 2526.84] Cause you mean more to me than any earthly thing
[2526.84 → 2530.42] So won't you reign in me again
[2530.42 → 2534.98] Lord reign in me, reign in your power
[2534.98 → 2538.84] Over all my dreams, in my darkest hour
[2539.40 → 2543.84] You are the Lord of all I am
[2544.60 → 2548.10] So won't you reign in me again
[2548.10 → 2552.62] Lord reign in me, reign in your power
[2552.62 → 2557.04] Over all my dreams, in my darkest hour
[2557.04 → 2562.26] You are the Lord of all I am
[2562.26 → 2565.90] So won't you reign in me again

[2578.36 → 2583.62] So won't you reign in me again
[2583.62 → 2585.26] So won't you reign in me again
[2585.36 → 2586.32] So won't you reign in me again
[2588.46 → 2591.48] One's Lord not only we Abu'r
[2591.48 → 2600.64] It is now time to continue our worship through the giving of our offerings.
[2601.60 → 2605.42] Today's offering is for the ministries of this church and also for the Calvinist Cadet Corps.
[2606.38 → 2610.74] The Calvinist Cadet Corps is the larger organization that our cadet club is part of.
[2611.38 → 2617.48] It includes cadet clubs across Canada, the United States, Ukraine, New Zealand, Australia,
[2617.70 → 2619.36] Kenya, Uganda, and South Sudan.
[2619.36 → 2627.84] The Calvinist Cadet Corps offers a structured program and resources specifically designed to help boys grow spiritually in all areas of their life.
[2628.46 → 2630.92] Devotional, mental, physical, and social.
[2631.46 → 2634.96] With their goal of encouraging them to live out the motto, Living for Jesus.
[2636.20 → 2640.90] As an independent ministry, the Calvinist Cadet Corps depends on your generous gifts and offerings
[2640.90 → 2644.68] to continue providing ministry materials for boys and for counsellors.
[2645.52 → 2647.36] Please give as the Lord has blessed you.
[2647.36 → 2655.78] And I think during the offering there will be a slideshow playing with some pictures from the past year from cadets.
[2655.78 → 2655.88] Thank you.
[2677.36 → 2686.66] The Lord has blessed you.
[2686.66 → 2690.74] Let all the earth rejoice.
[2690.74 → 2693.94] All the earth rejoice.
[2695.86 → 2700.10] He wraps Himself in light.
[2700.10 → 2709.10] And darkness strikes too high.
[2709.10 → 2709.32] And trembles at His voice.
[2709.40 → 2712.46] Trembles at His voice.
[2713.00 → 2718.36] How great is our God.
[2718.36 → 2724.62] Say with me how great is our God.
[2724.62 → 2727.92] And all will see how great.
[2727.92 → 2733.92] How great is our God.
[2733.92 → 2736.62] Age to age.
[2736.62 → 2742.62] Age to age He stands.
[2742.62 → 2743.62] Age to age He stands.
[2743.62 → 2749.62] Age to age He stands.
[2749.62 → 2751.42] And time is in His hands.
[2751.92 → 2753.50] Beginning and the end.
[2753.50 → 2755.04] Beginning and the end.
[2755.04 → 2757.46] And God hit three in one.
[2757.46 → 2761.68] God hit three in one.

[2923.52 → 2935.90] Good morning, everybody.
[2936.10 → 2941.58] Can I have preschool all the way up to grade four, but the cadets can stay seated?
[2942.78 → 2943.54] You were.
[2943.68 → 2944.10] Come on.
[2950.82 → 2951.60] You're okay.
[2953.52 → 2954.72] Perfect.
[2954.98 → 2955.26] Come on.
[2955.46 → 2956.10] It's okay.
[2956.40 → 2956.86] It's okay.
[2957.68 → 2958.00] Okay.
[2959.92 → 2961.44] I have a question for you guys.
[2961.44 → 2969.34] Have you ever wanted something so badly that you were so excited, and you talked about it
[2969.34 → 2977.44] for months and months and months on end for like maybe something like a special trip or
[2978.20 → 2981.02] a birthday or something.
[2981.22 → 2981.36] What?
[2982.06 → 2983.12] You had a birthday?
[2983.52 → 2989.56] And you thought about like a special gift where you wanted it so badly and you were
[2989.56 → 2991.22] excited about it?
[2991.60 → 2993.52] I put the flag at the tree.
[2993.76 → 2994.86] Oh, cool.
[2994.86 → 3001.22] So today in children's worship time, we are going to talk about things that we need and
[3001.22 → 3002.86] things that we want.
[3003.66 → 3013.50] And also we're going to talk about how sometimes certain drinks will quench our thirst with our
[3013.50 → 3014.64] needs and our wants.
[3014.64 → 3018.28] And Jesus will quench our thirst with everything.
[3018.28 → 3019.62] Okay, guys.
[3019.72 → 3020.62] So everybody stand up.
[3020.68 → 3024.74] We're going to go in more detail in children's worship time so you can tell your moms and dads
[3024.74 → 3025.34] after.
[3025.70 → 3027.52] So turn around and look at the congregation.
[3027.52 → 3030.78] Here we go.
[3030.78 → 3032.56] One, two, three.
[3032.56 → 3033.72] The Lord.
[3035.22 → 3037.00] And also with you.
[3037.00 → 3066.70] Good morning.
[3066.70 → 3067.70] I'm Eric here.
[3067.70 → 3069.16] I'm an elder at Emmanuel.
[3069.34 → 3071.58] I'll lead us in our church family prayer this morning.
[3071.58 → 3078.64] Lord Jesus, today we come to you on our family prayer on Cadet Sunday.
[3078.86 → 3082.92] We thank you for the leadership in our church from the men leading the cadet group.
[3083.22 → 3088.74] May they continue to provide the young men with leadership and continue to show us how
[3088.74 → 3092.12] it is to be leading the way with living for Jesus.
[3093.26 → 3094.20] Praise the Lord.
[3094.88 → 3096.42] Sing to the Lord a new song.
[3097.00 → 3099.22] Sing to the Lord all the years.
[3099.22 → 3102.22] Give thanks to the Lord for he is good.
[3102.50 → 3103.74] His love endures forever.
[3105.50 → 3108.68] Many people in our circles are still struggling with health concerns.
[3109.32 → 3114.60] We think of Lena as she's still continuing to be in the hospital with the hope of coming
[3114.60 → 3117.82] home soon with some sort of aid to help as needed.
[3117.82 → 3123.78] We pray for the rest of the family and friends as they deal with the ever-changing situation.
[3125.38 → 3128.94] Earlier this month, John V was diagnosed with bladder cancer.
[3129.38 → 3131.46] He will be starting his treatments later this week.
[3131.72 → 3134.22] We pray for a complete recovery.
[3134.22 → 3138.40] We pray for the family and friends as they support him in this journey.
[3139.40 → 3145.86] We also wanted to think of Tessa, daughter to Jerry, sister to Enema.
[3147.14 → 3151.92] We pray that she waits for the test results showing the mass in our lungs, and we pray for
[3151.92 → 3154.96] the healing and the treatment that may be required.
[3154.96 → 3162.54] At this time, we also think of Tim and Charity Johnson as they're no longer receiving support
[3162.54 → 3165.32] for their way ministries, which they've had since 2017.
[3165.96 → 3170.34] So there are uncertainties as to how they'll continue to serve the Native youth gathering
[3170.34 → 3172.30] in the Shushan area.
[3172.52 → 3175.82] We pray for your hand and leadership and guidance in this.
[3176.72 → 3182.08] Lord, we also think of Jermaine from Sun ridge as she's been worshipping with us for the last
[3182.08 → 3187.08] few years, but she's now moved to Abbotsford for further care, so she won't be amongst
[3187.08 → 3187.58] us anymore.
[3187.70 → 3192.28] We pray for finding a community to plug in and still be part of.
[3192.34 → 3194.32] Lord, thank you for the time she did have with us.
[3196.22 → 3200.16] This is the time of year when so many of us deal with all sorts of health concerns,
[3200.44 → 3203.54] some of us known to us, but many struggle in silence.
[3204.24 → 3206.68] We pray for your healing hand upon us.
[3206.68 → 3211.44] So do not fear, for I am with you.
[3211.76 → 3214.28] Do not be dismayed, for I am your God.
[3214.42 → 3215.46] I will strengthen you.
[3215.62 → 3216.44] I will help you.
[3216.82 → 3220.32] I will uphold you in my righteous right hand.
[3220.84 → 3221.08] Amen.
[3221.08 → 3222.08] Amen.
[3227.08 → 3228.24] Thank you.
[3228.24 → 3229.90] You're going to hop down.
[3247.90 → 3248.84] Morning, everybody.
[3249.90 → 3250.92] Morning, cadets.
[3251.88 → 3253.78] Welcome to Cadet Sunday, all.
[3254.10 → 3258.16] It's good to see so many of you boys sitting here in the front.
[3258.68 → 3261.06] Today's sermon's going to look just a little bit different.
[3261.20 → 3263.38] You can tell already because I'm down here on the floor.
[3264.36 → 3268.10] And I, church, I'm going to be addressing the cadets mostly.
[3268.78 → 3273.36] But as I direct this to the cadets, I hope and pray that all of you will be listening
[3273.36 → 3277.46] with active ears because this message that's going to the cadets is going to be true for
[3277.46 → 3278.46] all of us here today.
[3278.46 → 3284.76] And so that's your responsibility to be listening and applying this as we go through it.
[3284.80 → 3286.24] I'm also going to be preaching from the floor.
[3286.34 → 3287.24] So that's going to look different.
[3287.32 → 3290.68] And there are a few things happening around me that I'm going to need a few of your help
[3290.68 → 3291.02] with.
[3291.08 → 3291.84] Okay, guys?
[3291.94 → 3292.44] Is that okay?
[3292.44 → 3296.60] I have full-size chocolate bars for anybody who helps out and volunteers with me.
[3296.70 → 3298.40] If you want proof, Austin saw them.
[3298.44 → 3298.86] Right, Austin?
[3299.02 → 3300.04] He can vouch for me.
[3300.48 → 3300.76] All right?
[3300.96 → 3301.96] So there's your bribe.
[3302.10 → 3303.22] Bribery is alive and well.
[3303.94 → 3307.20] First things first, and most important things first.
[3307.32 → 3308.66] Austin's actually going to come up here.
[3308.70 → 3312.10] And he's going to read the text from this year.
[3312.10 → 3313.52] So I'm going to grab the microphone, Austin.
[3313.64 → 3317.98] You can stand right there at the front, too.
[3318.94 → 3319.88] There you are, sir.
[3319.88 → 3324.72] First Timothy 4, 12 to 14.
[3325.44 → 3330.86] Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers
[3330.86 → 3334.72] in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity.
[3335.30 → 3342.60] Until I come, devote yourselves to the public, reading of Scripture, to preaching, and to teaching.
[3342.60 → 3350.24] Do not neglect your gift, which was given you through prophecy when your body of elders laid their hands on you.
[3351.18 → 3351.74] Thank you.
[3355.18 → 3355.78] All right.
[3355.92 → 3357.46] Austin, thank you so much for doing that.
[3357.54 → 3359.32] The Word of the Lord.
[3360.52 → 3365.70] So, boys, when you read a passage like that, or any passage in the Bible, do you ever ask yourself,
[3365.96 → 3368.74] who wrote that, and who were they writing that to?
[3369.22 → 3369.72] Do you guys do that?
[3369.72 → 3372.02] That's an important question to ask when we open the Bible.
[3372.02 → 3373.90] It's always good to ask this sort of things.
[3374.04 → 3382.32] And so, here, in this case, the passage that we read was written by Paul, an apostle named Paul.
[3382.36 → 3384.10] And he wrote it to his friend named Timothy.
[3384.22 → 3385.38] That's why the book's called Timothy.
[3385.44 → 3386.20] That makes sense, right?
[3386.52 → 3390.00] But why was Paul writing to Timothy?
[3390.82 → 3396.34] I want to give you a little bit of a snapshot of who Timothy was and why Paul would be writing to him.
[3396.56 → 3397.76] And we're going to do that right now.
[3397.76 → 3401.16] So, it's time for True Stories with Pastor Kevin.
[3401.34 → 3401.66] All right?
[3402.02 → 3403.08] Here we go.
[3404.04 → 3405.32] The story of Timothy.
[3405.44 → 3406.64] The true story of Timothy.
[3406.74 → 3407.10] Are we ready?
[3408.10 → 3413.70] There once was a boy named Timothy who grew up in Lustra, a city where most people didn't follow God.
[3414.10 → 3421.78] His dad was Greek, but his mom, Eunice, that was her name, and his grandmother, Lois, were both Jewish.
[3421.78 → 3428.12] They both loved God, and they taught Timothy the scriptures from a young age and helped him grow strong in faith.
[3428.12 → 3433.50] Well, one day, Paul came to Lustra, and he noticed Timothy's great faith.
[3433.88 → 3436.38] He invited Timothy to join him on his missions' trips.
[3436.86 → 3438.92] So, naturally, Timothy said yes.
[3439.08 → 3445.50] And he travelled all over Asia with Paul, helping share the gospel and encouraging different churches wherever they went.
[3445.50 → 3451.06] Over time, Timothy became one of Paul's most trusted partners in ministry.
[3451.06 → 3455.60] And he helped Paul deliver important letters that helped strengthen churches.
[3455.74 → 3459.92] Letters like 1 Corinthians and 1 Thessalonians, which we've been hearing about lately, right?
[3459.92 → 3467.52] Eventually, Paul gave Timothy a huge job, leading a church in Ephesus.
[3468.10 → 3472.56] Now, this church was a tough place where false teachers were causing a lot of problems.
[3472.70 → 3478.04] So, to encourage him, Paul wrote Timothy letters like the one that we read today.
[3478.64 → 3481.48] And Timothy's favourite animal was bears.
[3481.96 → 3482.84] The end.
[3483.56 → 3484.92] I made up the last part.
[3485.02 → 3486.48] Everything else, though, was true.
[3486.86 → 3487.90] So, that's Timothy.
[3488.50 → 3489.58] That's who he is.
[3489.92 → 3494.64] And that's why Paul is writing to him, because he is this leader in this church in Ephesus.
[3495.16 → 3499.62] Now, even though that passage that Austin read was written specifically for Timothy,
[3499.92 → 3505.32] and specifically for his context, the message that he gives him is true for all of us here today.
[3505.94 → 3506.14] All right?
[3506.16 → 3512.74] No matter how young we are, we can set an example by how we speak, how we act, how we love,
[3512.80 → 3515.46] how we have faith, and how we stay pure.
[3515.88 → 3519.36] So, just like Timothy, we can make a difference in this world for Jesus.
[3519.36 → 3520.12] Right now.
[3520.96 → 3524.52] So, we read about this throughout, we can read about this story throughout the whole Bible.
[3524.68 → 3526.82] And we read about it in that little passage that we read today.
[3526.86 → 3531.16] And this is sort of the big idea that I want you all to take home with you today, is this.
[3531.84 → 3537.34] You are never too young to read your Bibles and be a godly example in this world.
[3537.40 → 3537.58] All right?
[3537.58 → 3543.90] You're not too young to read your Bibles and be a godly example in this world.
[3544.54 → 3548.10] So, in this passage today, which I know that you've looked at all year long,
[3548.24 → 3551.92] Paul tells Timothy to be a godly example as he leads this church.
[3551.98 → 3553.88] And he lists five ways here.
[3553.94 → 3555.32] Five ways that we can do that.
[3555.70 → 3562.38] He needs to be an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity.
[3562.38 → 3568.78] And like I said, that was specific to Timothy in this place, but it's also for us here today.
[3568.86 → 3569.52] It's true for us.
[3569.70 → 3572.98] We're supposed to be examples in our community in all five of those ways.
[3573.14 → 3576.72] So, we're going to look at all five of them really specifically together, okay?
[3577.20 → 3578.58] First, we're going to look at speech.
[3579.42 → 3581.28] How we talk to each other matters.
[3582.16 → 3583.28] But why do you think that is?
[3584.16 → 3587.34] Why are we supposed to be an example of how we speak to one another?
[3588.26 → 3590.60] What damage does our words actually do?
[3590.88 → 3591.70] Well, I'm going to need some help.
[3592.00 → 3593.86] First, this is where I need your help right away.
[3594.08 → 3595.62] I need four people to volunteer.
[3595.74 → 3596.22] Who's going to help?
[3597.16 → 3600.26] One, two, three, four.
[3600.34 → 3601.30] We'll get you guys later, okay?
[3601.32 → 3601.72] I promise.
[3601.84 → 3602.26] Okay, you four.
[3602.32 → 3602.74] Come up here.
[3602.76 → 3603.82] I need you to come around this table.
[3604.32 → 3604.88] Right here.
[3605.42 → 3607.20] You're going to go around here.
[3607.98 → 3609.56] One here, two in the middle, one in the end.
[3609.58 → 3609.94] Are you ready?
[3610.00 → 3610.64] Here's the big reveal.
[3610.64 → 3611.28] You have this end.
[3611.60 → 3612.94] Here, Lyndon, come this way.
[3613.28 → 3614.16] Come this way.
[3614.24 → 3614.72] There we go.
[3614.90 → 3616.08] And then Malachi, you can go on the end.
[3616.40 → 3617.32] One, two, three.
[3617.74 → 3618.82] Oh, it's toothpaste.
[3619.62 → 3620.76] Who would have thought?
[3621.46 → 3622.22] Toothpaste and plates.
[3622.34 → 3623.50] Okay, we're going to do a little bit of a race.
[3623.80 → 3624.28] This one's yours.
[3624.38 → 3624.92] This one's yours.
[3625.02 → 3625.50] This one's yours.
[3625.56 → 3626.02] This one's yours.
[3626.08 → 3626.48] Are you ready?
[3626.86 → 3630.22] We need you to get all of that toothpaste out onto the plate.
[3630.44 → 3634.32] Try to keep it on the plate, but it's kind of like soap, so it'll wash off.
[3635.24 → 3636.74] All right, so you guys can go.
[3636.90 → 3637.56] Get it on the plate.
[3638.12 → 3639.20] We need it all out.
[3639.40 → 3640.62] We need it all on your plate.
[3640.62 → 3641.96] Squeeze it out of that tube.
[3643.28 → 3644.02] Yeah, good job.
[3644.50 → 3645.06] Good work.
[3647.38 → 3648.86] Yeah, as much of it as you can.
[3648.94 → 3649.38] There you go.
[3650.36 → 3651.38] You can cheer them on, church.
[3651.46 → 3654.14] That might encourage them a little bit to, like, get them going.
[3657.38 → 3657.98] All right.
[3658.08 → 3659.34] I think you guys have done it.
[3660.10 → 3660.76] I think you guys have done it.
[3660.76 → 3661.64] I wasn't very clear.
[3661.88 → 3664.62] The race wasn't actually getting the toothpaste out of the tube.
[3665.46 → 3666.68] I just, we needed to get it out of the tube.
[3666.68 → 3667.26] Okay, are you ready?
[3667.34 → 3667.98] Here's the race.
[3668.62 → 3672.58] Whoever can put the toothpaste back in the tube the fastest wins.
[3672.82 → 3674.80] On your mark, get set, go!
[3674.80 → 3682.10] Is it working?
[3682.84 → 3683.50] How are we doing?
[3684.90 → 3685.18] Yeah?
[3686.80 → 3687.90] It doesn't work, does it?
[3688.20 → 3689.14] All right, you can put it down.
[3689.18 → 3690.44] You can just put it down, plop it down.
[3690.72 → 3692.78] That was a little bit of a red herring challenge.
[3692.98 → 3694.02] Just wipe it on your clothes.
[3694.12 → 3695.12] You'll smell like mint all day.
[3695.44 → 3696.50] All right, you can take a seat.
[3696.58 → 3697.70] Round of applause for their help.
[3698.64 → 3699.62] Good job, boys.
[3699.62 → 3703.76] All right, here's the thing, gentlemen.
[3704.48 → 3707.32] Our words are like that toothpaste.
[3708.56 → 3711.78] Once it comes out, you can't put them back in.
[3712.78 → 3716.30] Once we speak something, you can't take those words back.
[3716.36 → 3718.44] You can't pretend like you've never said them before.
[3719.12 → 3719.46] All right?
[3719.60 → 3721.70] That's why we have to be careful with our words.
[3721.78 → 3724.12] That's why we have to be an example of our speech.
[3724.44 → 3726.38] Proverbs 15, verse 1 says this.
[3726.38 → 3729.88] A gentle answer turns away wrath.
[3730.00 → 3730.76] That's like anger.
[3731.28 → 3734.64] But a harsh word stirs up anger.
[3735.04 → 3736.34] The book of James also talks about...
[3736.34 → 3737.20] Yeah, Linda, you go ahead.
[3737.40 → 3738.28] Wash your hands, buddy.
[3739.52 → 3739.84] They're...
[3739.84 → 3740.02] Yeah.
[3740.24 → 3741.22] They'll smell good, though.
[3741.94 → 3742.80] You guys can all go.
[3742.86 → 3743.90] If you need to go, just go quick.
[3744.02 → 3744.40] You're fine.
[3744.46 → 3744.82] You're fine.
[3744.90 → 3745.20] Okay, good.
[3746.02 → 3748.34] The book of James also talks about our words.
[3748.40 → 3749.42] You know what James talks about?
[3749.86 → 3752.88] James says that our words are like a spark,
[3753.36 → 3756.24] and they can light whole forests ablaze.
[3756.84 → 3758.94] And like the toothpaste, once we say something,
[3759.06 → 3760.64] it's impossible to put them back.
[3761.10 → 3763.70] We need to be such good examples of how we speak,
[3764.10 → 3767.14] because negative words can do a lot of damage.
[3767.54 → 3767.72] All right?
[3767.74 → 3770.46] We need to speak calmly and with respect,
[3770.80 → 3773.28] and not put each other down, but build each other up.
[3773.64 → 3775.52] Now, this is a message to all of us, though, right?
[3775.54 → 3776.70] Not just to these boys here.
[3776.98 → 3778.78] This includes all sorts of things,
[3778.86 → 3780.82] including our, for you adults out here,
[3780.82 → 3783.38] and maybe older cadets still, I'm talking to maybe youth as well,
[3783.38 → 3784.88] our online presence.
[3785.60 → 3789.86] What we say online also is part of this.
[3790.06 → 3791.46] What we post is seen forever.
[3791.58 → 3794.52] Even if you delete something, things have a tendency to linger,
[3794.64 → 3796.32] just like that classic Cranberry song.
[3797.08 → 3801.44] When you are commenting online, how are you speaking?
[3802.68 → 3805.34] Are you an example of right speech in your communities?
[3806.10 → 3808.20] When you're in a coffee shop or at a restaurant
[3808.20 → 3811.72] or at the grocery store, how are you speaking to one another?
[3812.38 → 3813.72] So, church, this is for all of us.
[3814.56 → 3816.12] But, cadets, you can do this now.
[3816.26 → 3817.92] You don't have to wait to get older
[3817.92 → 3819.94] to speak respectfully to each other,
[3820.00 → 3823.30] to be this example of right speech in our communities.
[3823.84 → 3824.02] All right?
[3824.08 → 3824.84] So that's the first one.
[3824.90 → 3827.02] Be an example of right speech.
[3827.94 → 3830.18] The second one is right conduct.
[3830.28 → 3832.08] How are we an example of right conduct?
[3832.22 → 3833.50] Okay, I want to talk to you guys about something.
[3833.50 → 3836.66] Who here watched a really awesome sports hockey game this week?
[3838.08 → 3839.36] You missed it?
[3839.68 → 3840.88] But have you heard about it?
[3841.04 → 3842.32] You heard about what happened?
[3842.42 → 3844.64] Yeah, you guys, everybody knows Canada beat the USA.
[3844.80 → 3845.96] We all know about that game, right?
[3846.16 → 3847.68] It was pretty awesome, wasn't it?
[3848.06 → 3849.04] It was a pretty great game.
[3849.46 → 3851.62] Now, here's something a little bit weird to think about maybe.
[3851.70 → 3853.44] I don't think we talk about this in sports too often.
[3854.46 → 3857.00] When you watched Canada versus the States this week,
[3857.38 → 3860.30] how many of you were watching the linesmen?
[3862.46 → 3862.86] Intentionally.
[3863.70 → 3864.52] Not really, right?
[3864.54 → 3865.08] Who does that?
[3865.26 → 3868.30] I mean, we don't really talk about the referees or the linesmen that often, do we?
[3868.84 → 3869.04] Right?
[3869.10 → 3869.98] They're just kind of there now.
[3870.04 → 3871.88] If they're making bad calls, maybe we do.
[3872.16 → 3873.68] Maybe then all of a sudden we notice them.
[3873.88 → 3876.20] But if they're not making bad calls, and they're just out there,
[3876.28 → 3878.58] like kind of that finals, we don't really ever notice them.
[3878.84 → 3881.52] Like, could any of you even tell me one of their names?
[3881.78 → 3884.12] There were two referees and two linesmen Thursday night.
[3884.22 → 3884.48] Anybody?
[3884.90 → 3885.60] What were their names?
[3886.22 → 3886.38] No?
[3886.46 → 3886.70] Anybody?
[3887.46 → 3888.36] What were their names?
[3890.26 → 3890.62] Yeah!
[3890.88 → 3891.82] Wow, we got one!
[3891.82 → 3893.02] Did we just look it up?
[3893.50 → 3894.52] I believe you.
[3894.76 → 3897.38] Good Dwyer and Chris Rooney were the referees.
[3897.48 → 3898.36] That is very impressive.
[3898.80 → 3901.44] That's one out of like 300, though, let me point out.
[3901.66 → 3902.68] My point still stands.
[3903.06 → 3905.88] The linesmen were Scott Sherry and Johnny Murray.
[3906.24 → 3909.02] I am certain most of us have never heard those names before.
[3909.68 → 3910.82] But why do I bring them up?
[3911.42 → 3912.08] Well, think about this.
[3912.18 → 3914.64] Can you imagine how that game would have gone if they weren't there?
[3914.64 → 3916.68] Just think about it.
[3916.70 → 3917.32] What would have happened?
[3919.08 → 3920.22] It would have been chaos.
[3920.66 → 3924.50] We would still be in like last week Saturday's game, the first nine seconds, I think.
[3924.84 → 3927.94] The referees and linesmen wouldn't have been able to...
[3927.94 → 3929.58] There would have been chaos everywhere.
[3929.70 → 3931.12] The players wouldn't have been able to play.
[3931.50 → 3936.44] Because what the referees and linesmen do is they make sure the game is played with proper conduct.
[3937.00 → 3939.88] They make sure that everybody's doing the things that they should be doing.
[3939.94 → 3940.66] They call penalties.
[3940.86 → 3943.54] They call icings and offsides and high sticks.
[3943.68 → 3946.68] They drop the pucks for face-offs and make sure the nets are secure.
[3947.08 → 3952.54] They ensure that proper hockey conduct is followed so that all of us can enjoy a game, right?
[3953.26 → 3957.32] For example, do you remember what happened right before Canada scored the overtime winner?
[3958.64 → 3959.02] Yeah.
[3959.44 → 3959.78] You remember?
[3959.94 → 3960.12] What?
[3961.12 → 3961.70] There was an icing.
[3961.70 → 3961.82] Nothing.
[3963.16 → 3964.18] America made a pass.
[3964.26 → 3964.68] It was missed.
[3964.74 → 3965.66] It went all the way down the ice.
[3965.74 → 3971.06] And Braden Point just beat out the American player to the red line to call an icing call.
[3971.16 → 3972.26] And the linesmen blew the whistle.
[3972.34 → 3975.64] If we didn't have a linesman, that whistle never happens.
[3975.78 → 3977.44] There's never a face-off in America's end.
[3977.54 → 3978.88] McDaid doesn't win that face-off.
[3978.98 → 3980.72] McCarry doesn't wrap it around the boards.
[3980.82 → 3981.98] Manner doesn't pass it to the slot.
[3982.24 → 3983.26] And McDaid doesn't bury it.
[3983.76 → 3985.20] Thank you, linesmen.
[3986.30 → 3986.70] Right?
[3987.14 → 3988.84] Right conduct matters.
[3988.84 → 3991.88] Right conduct helps us in life, too.
[3991.94 → 3994.62] It helps us live as God intends us to.
[3994.78 → 3999.34] Some people in this world, they like to kind of bend the rules a little bit or try to get
[3999.34 → 4001.04] away with as much as they can.
[4001.42 → 4005.24] But we're taught in God's Word to be an example of right conduct.
[4005.84 → 4010.20] We're called to live in a way that honours God, doing what's right even when no one is
[4010.20 → 4010.52] watching.
[4011.16 → 4012.30] That means being honest.
[4012.66 → 4013.44] It means not cheating.
[4013.66 → 4016.04] It means not seeing how much we can get away with.
[4016.04 → 4020.96] It means we should be working hard and treating people with respect and making a positive
[4020.96 → 4022.16] difference in our communities.
[4022.32 → 4022.44] Right?
[4022.84 → 4025.84] Our lives shouldn't be filled with chaos and selfishness.
[4026.24 → 4029.54] But we should show good character and integrity every day.
[4029.90 → 4032.34] That's what being an example of conduct means.
[4032.46 → 4032.94] That's speech.
[4033.14 → 4033.92] That's conduct.
[4034.98 → 4037.98] Now we're called to be examples of love.
[4038.26 → 4039.00] So what does that mean?
[4039.00 → 4045.32] Well, I have a story about a guy named Desmond Doss, and it's a true story.
[4045.40 → 4048.66] And so it's time for another segment of true stories with Pastor Kevin.
[4049.66 → 4050.02] All right.
[4050.26 → 4051.10] Desmond Doss.
[4051.16 → 4051.62] Are we ready?
[4052.54 → 4053.28] Here we go.
[4054.14 → 4060.88] Desmond Doss was a soldier who believed in fighting for his country, but he also believed
[4060.88 → 4063.68] that God called him to never harm another person.
[4064.46 → 4065.74] So how would he do that?
[4065.74 → 4069.70] Well, while other soldiers carried rifles, do you know what Doss carried?
[4070.46 → 4071.68] A medical kit.
[4072.82 → 4079.68] In World War II, during the Battle of Hacksaw Ridge in Okinawa, Japan, Desmond Doss's unit
[4079.68 → 4081.48] came under intense fire.
[4082.46 → 4085.14] Many soldiers were wounded and left on the battlefield.
[4086.00 → 4088.76] But instead of running away to safety, do you know what Desmond did?
[4089.16 → 4090.38] He stayed behind.
[4090.60 → 4092.34] And he stayed behind all alone.
[4092.34 → 4097.36] And he dragged and carried one wounded soldier after another to safety.
[4098.06 → 4100.48] And after each soldier, he prayed to God.
[4100.58 → 4103.16] He said, Lord, help me get one more.
[4104.30 → 4106.54] By the end of that battle, do you know how many soldiers he saved?
[4107.74 → 4108.62] Seventy-five.
[4109.84 → 4115.46] Seventy-five soldiers, including many who mocked him at the beginning because he didn't go to
[4115.46 → 4116.76] war with a gun in his hands.
[4117.40 → 4118.20] Isn't that something?
[4118.20 → 4120.68] And his favourite animal was flamingos.
[4122.40 → 4124.26] All right, the flamingos was a lie again.
[4124.34 → 4125.94] But the rest of that story is true.
[4126.60 → 4128.12] The rest of that story is true.
[4129.00 → 4133.20] That, boys, that is such a tremendous example of what love is.
[4133.54 → 4135.78] See, Doss is an example for love.
[4135.88 → 4139.60] And even though people mocked him for it, he went out and saved them.
[4140.16 → 4142.52] True love isn't just about saying you care.
[4142.60 → 4144.84] It's about putting others ahead of yourself, right?
[4144.84 → 4145.78] Even when it's hard.
[4146.42 → 4147.84] See, Doss didn't fight with weapons.
[4147.96 → 4154.68] He fought with love by risking his life 75 times to save as many people as he could.
[4156.38 → 4156.72] All right?
[4157.04 → 4159.18] By the end of the battle, he saved so many people.
[4159.42 → 4161.14] Again, even people who mocked him.
[4162.20 → 4162.74] It's amazing.
[4163.40 → 4164.52] So that's what love is.
[4164.66 → 4168.36] He was a perfect example of what Jesus says in John 15, 13.
[4168.46 → 4169.08] Jesus says this.
[4169.18 → 4172.60] He says, greater love has no one than this.
[4172.60 → 4175.26] That someone lay down his life for his friends.
[4175.96 → 4178.62] See, that's the kind of love that we're supposed to be an example of.
[4178.66 → 4181.94] The kind of love that puts others ahead of ourselves, right?
[4182.00 → 4187.46] Because no matter what you hear out in the world, in your schools, in the sports pitches,
[4187.82 → 4195.20] in any jobs you end up getting, no matter what you hear, you are not the main character of the story.
[4196.36 → 4198.68] You are not the main character in this world.
[4198.94 → 4200.94] And we're going to get to who is in just a minute, okay?
[4200.94 → 4200.98] Okay?
[4201.60 → 4204.20] So, we've looked at speech.
[4204.32 → 4204.94] We've looked at conduct.
[4205.06 → 4205.78] We've looked at love.
[4206.12 → 4208.18] Now we need to be examples of faith.
[4208.56 → 4209.38] What does this mean?
[4210.40 → 4210.70] All right?
[4210.74 → 4212.96] Well, it means putting our faith in the right place.
[4213.38 → 4216.40] I need a couple of cadet leaders first to help out.
[4216.48 → 4217.66] So we're going to get Alvin and Dave.
[4217.74 → 4218.44] You're going to come help me.
[4219.14 → 4219.36] All right?
[4219.42 → 4220.30] Alvin and Dave, come here.
[4220.34 → 4221.72] You're going to stand-off to the side here.
[4222.10 → 4224.34] And then I need two cadets, actually, this time.
[4224.60 → 4225.32] Two that haven't done it.
[4225.34 → 4227.26] If you were up here, okay, I'll do these two here.
[4227.56 → 4228.34] Sorry, boys in the back.
[4228.34 → 4229.02] You come see me later.
[4229.84 → 4231.20] These two right here are going to come.
[4231.42 → 4232.12] Unless you want to come.
[4232.18 → 4233.28] Yeah, Ty, I'll get you later.
[4233.90 → 4237.38] If you've all volunteered but didn't get picked, come see me afterwards too, okay?
[4237.68 → 4238.00] All right.
[4238.48 → 4240.30] We're going to talk about faith right now.
[4241.30 → 4243.18] Do you two trust these two guys?
[4244.60 → 4244.88] Mostly?
[4245.04 → 4245.16] Okay.
[4245.18 → 4245.82] Here's what I'm going to do.
[4245.98 → 4248.02] Can you two boys stand up on this chair right here?
[4248.06 → 4248.98] You can stand on this one.
[4249.18 → 4250.18] You can stand on this one.
[4250.48 → 4250.90] All right?
[4251.14 → 4252.58] You're going to face the crowd.
[4253.46 → 4255.32] And you're going to cross your arms like this.
[4256.26 → 4258.80] And these guys behind you are going to be right here.
[4258.98 → 4262.04] And all you're going to do is lean back, and they're going to catch you.
[4262.12 → 4263.50] So, Alvin, you guys can get nice and close.
[4263.68 → 4264.76] They don't need to lean too far.
[4265.14 → 4265.44] All right?
[4265.48 → 4266.64] Do you trust them to catch you?
[4266.74 → 4267.92] You can take a quick shoulder check.
[4268.30 → 4269.04] Do you see that they're there?
[4269.56 → 4272.32] When I say three, can we trust that they'll catch you?
[4272.94 → 4273.30] All right?
[4273.46 → 4275.12] One, two, three.
[4275.12 → 4275.52] Hey.
[4278.56 → 4279.14] Pretty good.
[4279.22 → 4279.80] They went for it.
[4279.84 → 4280.00] All right.
[4280.04 → 4280.50] That was good.
[4280.78 → 4281.68] That shows faith.
[4281.92 → 4282.76] Faith that they would be there.
[4283.02 → 4283.28] All right.
[4283.60 → 4285.56] Dave and Alvin, can you guys stand on the chairs?
[4285.90 → 4287.50] You guys are going to stand here now.
[4287.92 → 4288.26] Okay?
[4288.38 → 4291.62] So, you're going to catch Dave, and you're going to catch Alvin.
[4291.78 → 4292.02] All right?
[4292.10 → 4292.66] Hands up.
[4293.50 → 4294.06] Hands up.
[4294.64 → 4294.90] All right.
[4294.92 → 4295.88] I'm going to count to three.
[4295.98 → 4296.44] Are you ready?
[4297.36 → 4298.52] One, two.
[4298.56 → 4299.28] No, don't do it.
[4300.40 → 4301.66] That's terrifying, right?
[4302.58 → 4303.42] That's terrifying.
[4303.66 → 4303.78] Okay.
[4303.80 → 4304.50] You guys can all sit down.
[4304.50 → 4304.96] Round of applause.
[4304.96 → 4305.56] Round of applause.
[4310.72 → 4311.26] All right.
[4312.24 → 4313.58] This is why that matters.
[4314.52 → 4318.60] You cadets had faith that Dave and Alvin were going to catch you.
[4318.82 → 4319.80] And that was fair faith.
[4319.86 → 4320.56] That was good faith.
[4320.62 → 4322.62] You put faith that they would do it because you knew that they could.
[4323.52 → 4328.30] But what if, is it cadet leader, counsellor, Dave?
[4328.68 → 4330.86] Just Dave and just Alvin.
[4330.96 → 4332.64] Cadet leader, counsellor, Alvin, doesn't matter.
[4332.64 → 4335.86] What if Dave and Alvin trusted that you guys would catch them?
[4336.06 → 4336.76] What would have happened?
[4338.76 → 4340.60] They would squish you hard.
[4340.60 → 4342.96] You would have been just part of the carpet.
[4342.96 → 4343.08] Right?
[4343.08 → 4344.16] Right?
[4344.16 → 4349.38] Because sometimes, even if we have a lot of faith, if we put it in the wrong things, it
[4349.38 → 4350.36] doesn't do us any good.
[4350.36 → 4351.86] But in fact, it can do a lot of harm.
[4351.86 → 4355.34] So it's not actually the amount of faith that we have.
[4355.84 → 4357.84] It's what are we putting our faith in.
[4358.70 → 4363.84] See, sometimes in life, we're not as smart as you cadets were in not letting those leaders
[4363.84 → 4364.40] fall on you.
[4364.44 → 4366.40] We put our faith in the wrong things.
[4366.50 → 4367.68] Adults, we do this all the time.
[4368.24 → 4372.40] Adults, we put our trust in our savings accounts, our workplaces, our political platforms.
[4372.70 → 4374.10] I could list a hundred things.
[4375.12 → 4380.52] And we claim, either explicitly or implicitly, that those things will save us, that they will
[4380.52 → 4382.00] give us hope, that they will bring us peace.
[4382.72 → 4384.26] We put our faith in the wrong thing.
[4384.26 → 4388.00] And cadets, maybe you're trying to put your hope or your peace, if you're finding hope
[4388.00 → 4393.16] or peace in sports or in friends, or we think if we just try a little harder, we can save
[4393.16 → 4393.58] ourselves.
[4393.68 → 4396.66] But when we do that, we're putting our faith in the wrong thing.
[4397.92 → 4400.00] See, the object of the faith matters.
[4400.24 → 4404.60] Jesus is the only one that offers us grace and peace and hope.
[4404.62 → 4406.12] And we're going to talk about that in just a second.
[4406.18 → 4408.94] But we need to remember to put our faith in Jesus, okay?
[4409.24 → 4411.46] He is the true main character of this story.
[4412.00 → 4413.32] So he's who we need to remember.
[4413.32 → 4416.02] So we got speech, we got conduct, we got love, we got faith.
[4416.44 → 4417.90] And finally, purity.
[4418.44 → 4420.20] We need to be examples of purity.
[4420.38 → 4424.96] Now, I was going to do a pretty disgusting example for this.
[4425.18 → 4426.06] You know what I was thinking about doing?
[4426.14 → 4427.66] I was thinking of bringing a bucket in.
[4428.10 → 4431.68] And in the bucket was going to be a bunch of garbage and maybe a little bit of my dog's
[4431.68 → 4431.88] poop.
[4432.16 → 4433.46] And I was going to bring it in.
[4433.74 → 4435.12] And then I was going to show you a candy.
[4435.30 → 4437.04] And I was going to be like, who wants to eat this candy?
[4437.20 → 4438.32] And you all would be like, yeah.
[4438.44 → 4439.86] And I would be like, all right, plop.
[4440.16 → 4441.66] Now who wants to eat the candy?
[4442.56 → 4442.84] Right?
[4442.84 → 4444.52] And that's what I was worried about.
[4444.92 → 4446.02] I was worried.
[4446.86 → 4448.76] So I didn't do it for a few reasons.
[4449.10 → 4452.24] The first reason is I didn't really want to carry around a bunch of dog poop.
[4452.66 → 4456.90] The second reason is I was certain a few of you were going to say yes and eat the candy.
[4457.02 → 4459.60] And then we'd have a whole case of like septicemia on our hands.
[4459.60 → 4468.78] But third, and most importantly, the example actually, that example is not the best way to explain what purity is about.
[4468.88 → 4474.66] You see, purity, it isn't about us avoiding things that might make us dirty from the outside.
[4474.66 → 4479.42] It's not just about us staying away from the bad things out there.
[4479.42 → 4481.92] It's about what's inside our hearts.
[4481.92 → 4482.58] All right?
[4482.58 → 4487.44] So in Matthew, in chapter 15, verse 19, Jesus talks about this.
[4487.50 → 4487.98] And he says,
[4488.48 → 4492.42] For out of the heart come evil thoughts like murder and theft and slander.
[4493.64 → 4500.24] In other words, sin isn't just out there or outside of us that we have to avoid or run away from,
[4500.24 → 4502.52] even though we do have to do that sometimes.
[4502.78 → 4506.40] But it actually starts inside of us, in our thoughts and in our desires.
[4507.22 → 4510.34] That means purity isn't just about staying away from bad influences.
[4510.98 → 4516.50] It's about what we are or who we are and what we let control our hearts and minds.
[4517.20 → 4518.24] So then how do we stay pure?
[4519.42 → 4521.42] Well, it starts about what do we focus on.
[4521.68 → 4523.94] In 2 Corinthians 10, Paul says,
[4524.40 → 4527.10] Take every thought captive to obey Christ.
[4527.10 → 4530.40] That means when a wrong or sinful thought pops into our heads,
[4530.44 → 4532.94] whether it's jealousy or anger or pride or anything else,
[4533.76 → 4535.18] we don't just let it stay there.
[4536.24 → 4538.44] Instead, we bring it to God, and we ask him for help.
[4538.60 → 4541.52] And he helps shift our thoughts and shift our minds,
[4541.86 → 4543.36] the things that are good and right.
[4543.76 → 4546.94] So purity is more about filling our hearts and minds with good things.
[4547.04 → 4550.46] It's about making sure our thoughts and words and our actions reflect Jesus.
[4551.08 → 4551.20] Right?
[4551.52 → 4552.58] So that's the five things.
[4552.66 → 4554.12] Can you guys remember what were the five things?
[4554.20 → 4555.20] Can you repeat them back to me?
[4555.20 → 4558.24] Number one, you just shout them out.
[4558.30 → 4558.68] Speech?
[4559.28 → 4559.42] Yeah.
[4560.64 → 4561.12] Conduct?
[4561.20 → 4561.40] Good.
[4562.02 → 4562.42] Love?
[4562.56 → 4562.76] Yeah.
[4563.38 → 4563.74] Faith?
[4563.86 → 4564.08] Yeah.
[4564.72 → 4565.12] Purity?
[4565.32 → 4566.02] Pretty good.
[4566.62 → 4567.56] Pretty good.
[4568.36 → 4568.66] All right.
[4569.32 → 4571.56] I have one last, well, kind of two last things.
[4572.04 → 4572.82] Two last things.
[4572.90 → 4573.98] My first question is this.
[4575.12 → 4579.58] Where do we turn in order to understand what it means to be those examples?
[4579.72 → 4581.54] Where do we turn to help us be those examples?
[4581.96 → 4582.36] Any idea?
[4582.36 → 4582.44] Yeah.
[4583.32 → 4583.58] Yeah.
[4584.44 → 4584.78] God.
[4584.86 → 4585.54] That's a great answer.
[4585.58 → 4586.90] And where do we hear God's voice?
[4587.52 → 4588.06] The Bible.
[4588.56 → 4588.94] That's right.
[4589.00 → 4589.84] Remember our big idea?
[4590.16 → 4594.54] You're never too young to read your Bibles and be a godly example in this world.
[4594.80 → 4598.52] Have you guys ever thought about how amazing it is that we can read the Bible anytime we want?
[4599.22 → 4600.76] We have Bibles all over the place.
[4600.82 → 4601.78] We have Bibles in our homes.
[4601.96 → 4603.32] We have Bibles on our phones.
[4603.54 → 4604.68] We have Bibles at church.
[4604.78 → 4606.00] They're hanging out in the back there.
[4606.24 → 4607.64] We've got Bibles everywhere.
[4607.64 → 4613.64] But did you know that when Timothy was leading this church in Ephesus, people couldn't just
[4613.64 → 4614.92] read the Bible whenever they wanted?
[4615.56 → 4619.18] Most people didn't own copies of the Bible, and it wasn't even fully put together yet.
[4619.36 → 4620.50] Most people couldn't even read.
[4621.44 → 4624.40] Instead, they had to listen to it being read out loud in church.
[4624.68 → 4629.78] That's why the passage that Austin read talked about how Paul told Timothy to make sure that
[4629.78 → 4631.30] Scripture was read publicly.
[4631.30 → 4637.04] Timothy's job was to make sure God's Word was heard and preached and taught because it's powerful.
[4637.72 → 4639.52] It's not just about reading words.
[4639.64 → 4643.96] It's about letting God speak to His people because that's what the Bible is.
[4644.40 → 4648.40] See, we can open up our Bibles and read God's Word whenever we want, and that's an incredible
[4648.40 → 4648.70] gift.
[4648.80 → 4652.46] But I do think, and again, adults, listen to this carefully.
[4653.28 → 4658.92] Sometimes because we have such easy access to the Bible, we forget how amazing it truly is.
[4658.92 → 4661.38] Think about it.
[4661.40 → 4666.60] When we hear the Bible read, whether it's at church or at cadets or at home or by yourself,
[4667.24 → 4669.30] those are God's words to you.
[4669.98 → 4673.26] So when Austin read that passage, they weren't His words.
[4674.08 → 4678.16] If I read it, they're not my words or Pastor Chris's words or your cadet leader's words or
[4678.16 → 4679.32] your parents' words.
[4679.40 → 4680.40] They're God's words.
[4681.46 → 4683.34] That's why reading the Bible matters so much.
[4683.40 → 4687.58] It teaches us how to live, how to love, how to follow Jesus and be an example in this world
[4687.58 → 4689.48] because that's what God is telling us.
[4691.32 → 4693.46] But sometimes when we live, we mess up, don't we?
[4693.48 → 4693.88] We all do.
[4693.94 → 4694.74] We all fall short.
[4694.82 → 4695.96] We don't quite hit that bar.
[4696.46 → 4698.00] Maybe we say things that are wrong.
[4698.06 → 4699.12] Maybe we're not quite so loving.
[4699.22 → 4700.46] Maybe we think some bad things.
[4702.28 → 4705.54] And sometimes hearing what God wants from us can maybe feel a little bit overwhelming
[4705.54 → 4708.34] because we don't always get it right.
[4709.10 → 4710.36] But here's the best news.
[4710.68 → 4711.38] Are you ready for this?
[4711.52 → 4712.66] Here's the best news.
[4712.66 → 4715.74] Jesus got it right for us.
[4716.84 → 4720.16] See, Jesus doesn't just tell us how to live.
[4720.82 → 4723.60] Jesus actually lived it, and He lived it perfectly.
[4724.28 → 4726.92] When Jesus was tempted to sin, He didn't.
[4727.78 → 4729.06] In fact, He used the Bible.
[4729.18 → 4731.50] He used Scripture to help Him.
[4731.80 → 4732.96] His speech was godly.
[4733.04 → 4734.14] His conduct was perfect.
[4734.44 → 4735.70] His love was sacrificial.
[4735.88 → 4737.36] His faith never wavered.
[4737.60 → 4738.46] He was pure.
[4739.36 → 4741.90] And He was tempted just like us, but He never messed up.
[4742.90 → 4746.94] And yet, even though Jesus was perfect, He took the punishment that we deserved.
[4747.40 → 4751.78] He died on the cross for your sins and for my sins, but He didn't stay dead either.
[4752.56 → 4754.26] He rose again, and now He lives in heaven.
[4754.36 → 4758.52] Because of what Jesus did, we can be forgiven and saved.
[4758.90 → 4760.42] That's what the Bible teaches us.
[4760.68 → 4762.64] That's what we read about when we open Scripture.
[4764.10 → 4765.42] So what does this mean for you?
[4765.92 → 4768.74] And I'm ending here, so you can just stay with me for another minute or two, and then I'm done.
[4768.74 → 4769.38] I promise.
[4769.94 → 4770.20] All right?
[4770.20 → 4777.36] It means that because Jesus already saved us, we don't have to be perfect to earn God's love.
[4778.06 → 4783.56] Instead, we follow Jesus and try to be these examples because we love Him and because we
[4783.56 → 4784.52] are already saved.
[4785.28 → 4787.70] We are now Jesus' hands and feet in this world.
[4787.76 → 4791.52] And when we read the Bible, we remember who Jesus is and what He did for us.
[4791.52 → 4797.04] So as we grow in our faith, and we start to become more and more like Him, we know that
[4797.04 → 4800.96] it's not because we need to do that to be saved, because Jesus already saved us.
[4801.40 → 4805.72] But we do that because we love Him, and we want to live the way our Saviour calls us to.
[4806.46 → 4811.38] Now, you might think that maybe it's just this passage that talks about how we should speak
[4811.38 → 4817.10] and act and love and, man, you remember them better than I did, and be pure and the faith
[4817.10 → 4817.40] one.
[4817.68 → 4819.10] You remember those five things.
[4819.44 → 4821.52] And it's not just this passage that talks about this.
[4821.62 → 4824.82] The Bible is full of passages that call us to these.
[4824.96 → 4825.70] Take a look at the screen.
[4826.00 → 4826.52] There's going to be one.
[4826.52 → 4831.54] Those are just some of the Bible passages I found in like two minutes, all about those
[4831.54 → 4832.08] five things.
[4832.38 → 4840.14] The Bible is full of verses teaching us how to speak, teaching us how to act, how to love,
[4840.34 → 4843.02] how to have faith, how to live as examples of purity.
[4844.70 → 4846.26] And again, we don't do that to be saved.
[4846.34 → 4847.92] We do that because Jesus saves us.
[4848.00 → 4850.88] If we want to grow in our faith, we need to read our Bibles.
[4851.42 → 4856.40] And when we read about how Jesus speaks, how He lived, how He loved, how He trusted God,
[4856.52 → 4858.32] it shapes us to live that way too.
[4858.86 → 4861.18] The more we know Jesus, the more we'll want to follow Him.
[4861.24 → 4863.52] So here's my final challenge for you boys.
[4863.60 → 4863.98] Are you ready?
[4864.58 → 4865.30] Adults, listen up.
[4866.68 → 4871.38] My challenge to you that I actually want you to do is to read about Jesus.
[4872.20 → 4877.88] So cadets, with maybe it's a parent or a grandparent or an uncle or an aunt or a mentor or a friend
[4877.88 → 4882.26] or another adult in this world, read through the book of John.
[4883.16 → 4884.14] All right, just that one book.
[4884.46 → 4885.54] Read through the book of John.
[4885.54 → 4886.92] Take as long as you want.
[4887.24 → 4888.14] You can do it in a week.
[4888.20 → 4888.82] You can do it a month.
[4888.90 → 4889.68] You can do it after dinner.
[4889.76 → 4890.52] You can do it before bed.
[4890.58 → 4891.52] You can do it first thing in the morning.
[4891.58 → 4892.02] Doesn't matter.
[4892.50 → 4893.54] Take as long as you want.
[4894.08 → 4897.00] Read it as short or as long as you need.
[4897.40 → 4903.80] But read about how Jesus obeyed God, how He loved people like no one else, that no one
[4903.80 → 4904.46] else cared about.
[4904.92 → 4910.82] Pay attention to how He spoke, how He acted, how He loved, how He had faith, and how He lived.
[4910.82 → 4914.70] And if you don't have a Bible that's easy to understand, just ask for one.
[4914.96 → 4915.14] All right?
[4915.16 → 4916.04] I've got some in my office.
[4916.14 → 4917.96] If you want to come find me, I'll happily give one to you.
[4918.14 → 4921.58] You can get an Action Bible or an NLT or a Youth Bible, but read it.
[4922.28 → 4922.96] That's my challenge.
[4923.06 → 4923.86] Read the book of John.
[4923.94 → 4926.44] Take as long as you need, but read the book of John.
[4926.60 → 4928.98] And if you'd rather read Matthew or Mark or Luke, that's fine.
[4928.98 → 4931.34] But read one of the Gospels.
[4931.48 → 4932.92] Read about Jesus this week, church.
[4934.44 → 4935.16] Listening ears.
[4936.30 → 4937.50] God's Word is powerful.
[4938.54 → 4939.34] It teaches us.
[4939.42 → 4940.14] It changes us.
[4940.20 → 4941.54] It draws us closer to Jesus.
[4942.22 → 4946.22] So don't take the Bible for granted, but read it and listen to it and learn from it.
[4946.24 → 4950.06] And when you'll do, you'll see that God is speaking to you, and He's shaping you, and He's
[4950.06 → 4954.08] helping you become more like Him so that we can positively affect the world around us.
[4954.08 → 4959.92] Because, cadets, you are not too young to read your Bibles and be a godly example in this world.
[4960.32 → 4963.04] And that is how you can lead the way.
[4963.70 → 4963.94] Yeah?
[4964.38 → 4964.62] Amen?
[4965.10 → 4965.72] Can I pray?
[4966.02 → 4967.20] And then we're going to sing some songs, okay?
[4967.96 → 4968.52] Let's pray.
[4969.48 → 4973.58] Father in heaven, we are so grateful that you sent your Son to come into this world,
[4974.24 → 4977.92] come down from the throne of heaven, to be born here in this earth,
[4978.06 → 4981.32] to live the life that He did, to die a death we all deserved,
[4981.58 → 4983.78] and then rise again and that He has saved us.
[4983.78 → 4987.00] And if we believe that to be true, that we are saved.
[4987.86 → 4991.08] And so, God, because we know that, may we look to your Word
[4991.08 → 4994.26] and learn and know what it means to live for Jesus.
[4994.74 → 4998.24] May we learn how to speak well, to be examples in how we live,
[4998.84 → 5004.32] how we love each other, Lord, in the way we act, in the faith that we have.
[5004.48 → 5006.42] God, may we think pure thoughts as well.
[5006.54 → 5011.88] And God, may you continue to shape us in this world so that we seek you first in all things.
[5011.88 → 5013.30] I thank you for these boys.
[5013.30 → 5017.92] May they really understand that they are not too young to be an example for you in this world,
[5018.22 → 5023.90] whether that's in their schools, in their sports, God, in their extracurricular activities,
[5024.30 → 5027.28] wherever they find themselves, God, that they can love you.
[5027.42 → 5029.52] And may they learn to love you and follow you
[5029.52 → 5032.12] and open up those Bibles to learn what it means to follow you.
[5032.62 → 5034.84] God, we pray this in your Son's precious and holy name.
[5035.34 → 5035.56] Amen.
[5035.56 → 5035.68] Amen.
[5037.24 → 5037.78] Thanks, boys.
[5037.82 → 5038.54] We're going to sing now, okay?
[5039.90 → 5044.04] So, cadets, it's really cool that you're using God's Word to guide you.
[5044.24 → 5049.26] And this song is about that, about God's Word lighting our path.
[5049.46 → 5051.60] So why don't we just stand, and we'll sing these songs.
[5051.60 → 5081.18] Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet,
[5081.18 → 5087.08] And a light unto my path.
[5087.08 → 5093.28] My Word is a lamp unto my feet,
[5093.28 → 5099.40] And a light unto my path.
[5099.40 → 5102.82] When I feel afraid,
[5102.82 → 5105.74] Think I've lost my way,
[5105.74 → 5111.66] Still you're there right beside me.
[5112.00 → 5114.56] Nothing will I fear,
[5114.74 → 5117.62] As long as you are near,
[5118.30 → 5124.30] Please be near me to the end.
[5124.30 → 5132.20] Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet,
[5132.20 → 5138.28] And a light unto my path.
[5138.28 → 5144.20] Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet,
[5144.20 → 5149.90] And a light unto my path.
[5149.90 → 5155.22] I will not forget your love for me,
[5155.22 → 5161.58] And yet my heart forever is wandering.
[5162.80 → 5165.38] Jesus, be my God,
[5165.38 → 5168.48] And hold me to your side,
[5168.48 → 5174.72] And I will love you to the end.
[5174.72 → 5182.62] Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet,
[5182.62 → 5188.62] And a light unto my path.
[5188.62 → 5194.62] Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet,
[5194.62 → 5200.62] And a light unto my path.
[5200.62 → 5206.52] O God, you are my God,
[5206.52 → 5212.52] And I will ever praise you.
[5212.52 → 5218.52] O God, you are my God,
[5218.52 → 5224.52] And I will ever praise you.
[5224.52 → 5230.42] I will sing you in the morning,
[5230.42 → 5236.42] And I will learn to walk in your way,
[5236.42 → 5242.00] And step by step you'll lead me,
[5242.00 → 5248.12] And I will follow you all of my days.
[5248.12 → 5254.02] O God, you are my God,
[5254.02 → 5260.02] And I will ever praise you.
[5260.02 → 5266.02] O God, you are my God,
[5266.02 → 5272.02] And I will ever praise you.
[5272.02 → 5285.92] O God, you are my God,
[5285.92 → 5287.92] And I will ever praise you.
[5287.92 → 5289.92] O God, you are my God,
[5289.92 → 5294.92] And I will ever praise you all of my days.
[5294.92 → 5298.82] O God, you are my God,
[5298.82 → 5304.82] And I will praise you all of my days.
[5304.82 → 5306.82] O God, you are my God,
[5306.82 → 5308.82] You are my God,
[5308.82 → 5310.82] And I will praise you all of my days.
[5310.82 → 5312.72] You are a lamp unto my feet,
[5312.72 → 5318.72] And I will lie unto my path.
[5318.72 → 5326.72] You are the light unto my path.
[5326.72 → 5328.72] O God, you are my God,
[5328.72 → 5330.72] All right.
[5330.72 → 5332.62] So cadets, know that you are not too young
[5332.62 → 5335.02] To be that godly example in this world.
[5335.02 → 5337.02] And church, know the same is for all of us.
[5337.02 → 5340.52] That we are called to be a godly example in this world.
[5340.52 → 5342.52] And so as we go from this place,
[5342.52 → 5345.22] Know that you're not just being excused from this place.
[5345.22 → 5348.32] You're being sent to this place to be those examples
[5348.32 → 5349.82] As God has called us to live.
[5349.82 → 5353.52] And as we go, please hear these words from number six,
[5353.52 → 5355.02] The priestly blessing.
[5355.02 → 5358.32] The Lord bless you and keep you.
[5358.32 → 5362.42] The Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[5362.42 → 5366.42] The Lord turn his face towards you and give you his peace.
[5366.42 → 5369.42] And all of God's people said, Amen.
[5369.42 → 5374.42] Now we're singing the song for the cadets.
[5374.42 → 5377.42] And we just liked the very first verse in the chorus.
[5377.42 → 5381.42] If all the guys can sing and the ladies can enjoy our voices.
[5381.42 → 5384.42] And then we'll all join in after that.
[5384.42 → 5388.82] Oh, yeah.
[5388.82 → 5389.82] We were supposed to do that too.
[5389.82 → 5394.82] Hey, cadets, why don't you come up and help the church sing the song?
[5394.82 → 5395.82] So just come on up.
[5395.82 → 5398.82] Find a spot either on the stage here or in front of the stage.
[5398.82 → 5402.82] Be nice that everybody can see who you guys are.
[5402.82 → 5407.22] You can come up, up, high up here too if you want.
[5407.22 → 5412.22] So here's our cadet club.
[5412.22 → 5416.80] Lovely
[5416.80 → 5417.80] Amen.
[5446.80 → 5447.80] Amen.
[5476.80 → 5477.80] Amen.
[5506.80 → 5507.80] Amen.
[5536.80 → 5537.80] Amen.
[5566.80 → 5577.08] My life I give henceforth to live, O Christ, for you alone.
[5579.20 → 5595.80] Living for Jesus wherever I am, doing each duty in his holy name.
[5596.80 → 5604.84] Seeking the lost ones, he died to redeem.
[5606.16 → 5613.98] Bringing the weary to find rest in him.
[5614.64 → 5623.00] O Jesus, Lord and Saviour, I give myself to you.
[5623.00 → 5631.00] For you in your atonement did give myself for me.
[5632.36 → 5635.84] I owe no other master.
[5636.84 → 5640.00] My heart shall be our throne.
[5640.00 → 5652.00] My life I give henceforth to live, O Christ, for you alone.
[5652.00 → 5655.42] Have a good week.
[5655.42 → 5662.42] Thank you so much.
[5662.42 → 5664.78] Thank you so much.
[5664.78 → 5665.88] May body nice.
[5665.88 → 5669.78] May body nice.
[5669.78 → 5678.66] Hallelujah, to my Anatomist' future would be our family by calling myself mind maybe me or whether you're a father or the father or the father or father could not be Trafalgar as a father.
[5678.66 → 5683.78] Smart choices are not my and wish absolutely Raft and others unrest'll alive.
[5684.04 → 5685.80] It's horrifying.
[5685.80 → 5686.28] Come on Carrion, get horny.
[5686.32 → 5687.80] Several times a couple of hundred but still have other talents come from pi.
[5687.80 → 5717.78] Thank you.
[5717.80 → 5747.78] Thank you.
