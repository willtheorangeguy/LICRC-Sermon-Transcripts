[535.00 → 535.48] Good morning.
[536.20 → 537.30] Are we out there?
[537.38 → 538.08] There we go.
[538.18 → 539.08] Good morning, everyone.
[539.34 → 541.34] Welcome to church.
[541.56 → 545.30] A special welcome if you are a guest here with us this morning.
[545.30 → 546.30] My name is Chris.
[546.30 → 554.62] I'm one of the pastors here at Emanuel, and it's our privilege together to begin this Advent
[554.62 → 562.46] season, this season of waiting and expectation of hope, anticipation for Christmas in worship
[562.46 → 563.30] together.
[563.30 → 569.14] Before we begin our worship, we've got a couple announcements to make, actually a long list
[569.14 → 570.42] of announcements to make.
[570.92 → 572.80] And so I'm going to work through that.
[573.48 → 580.40] First, this evening is the HCBC and Canons of Dort classes.
[580.40 → 583.42] They're meeting here at 7 p.m.
[583.42 → 587.70] And so grades 9 through 12, you're here for HCBC.
[587.70 → 592.46] And then anyone else, you're welcome to join my group for the Canons of Dort class.
[592.58 → 594.60] We start at 7 o'clock together.
[594.60 → 603.42] Also, you'll have probably seen on your way in, the next instalment of the photo directory
[603.42 → 606.50] is in its final stages of preparation.
[606.86 → 613.02] And so if you are a member here, your information is likely in that photo directory.
[613.02 → 619.40] We just want you to verify that it is correct, that the right phone numbers and email is there,
[619.40 → 626.04] that there's a space in your postal code, for example, and that the picture that you
[626.04 → 629.18] have submitted is still the picture you want there.
[629.28 → 631.52] And we've got to follow that up really quickly.
[631.96 → 637.36] So please, Maria will be out there after the service if you have any questions.
[637.50 → 641.80] There are pens, and so just write down the correct information on that.
[642.86 → 647.08] This Wednesday, the Through the Bible group is going to be meeting again.
[647.08 → 651.18] We're working our way through the Bible in three years, and we're meeting on Wednesday
[651.18 → 652.88] to discuss the Book of Romans.
[653.68 → 660.26] So I encourage you to finish that up if you haven't yet, and then gather on Wednesday at 7 p.m. here.
[663.38 → 671.88] We have been, in the past little while, talking about the needs that Jody and Uriel have in Mexico,
[672.24 → 675.56] missionary families that we support there, one of our ministry partners,
[675.56 → 679.18] that we've been connected with for many, many, many, many, many years.
[679.64 → 683.98] They had a property emergency and are in need of some construction.
[684.44 → 688.56] You guys have done an awesome job and raised an incredible amount of support.
[689.66 → 696.02] And they have asked if Brandon might come down and connect with them in the process.
[696.02 → 699.72] And so we would love to send a small team with Brandon.
[700.62 → 707.20] And so if you are interested in seeing what we do in Mexico, it's not going to be a work trip
[707.20 → 711.28] because of labour rules and things like that.
[711.84 → 714.24] But you will connect with our ministry partners there.
[714.78 → 717.28] We would love to send a group of three or four.
[717.28 → 724.92] If you're interested in that, Brandon is going to be in the multipurpose room following the service today
[724.92 → 728.84] because we would like to do that when they're ready to do the work.
[729.36 → 731.34] And so that could be in two weeks.
[731.76 → 732.94] It could be in a month.
[733.52 → 735.84] So if you've got some flexibility and some interest,
[736.00 → 738.64] please connect with Brandon following worship.
[739.16 → 740.02] Grab your coffees.
[740.12 → 740.84] Make your connections.
[740.84 → 743.64] But then a little while after that, in the multipurpose room,
[743.72 → 745.82] Brandon will be there to answer any questions.
[748.96 → 749.48] Five.
[749.74 → 750.18] Five.
[750.32 → 753.38] We need a youth coffee host for next Sunday.
[754.04 → 760.08] So Pastor Kevin is looking for someone to host the youth coffee after church on Sunday.
[760.52 → 762.10] So Kevin, he's right there.
[762.20 → 764.44] He would love to connect with you after our service.
[765.92 → 767.94] Also, seniors lunch.
[767.94 → 771.88] Every year, the deacons host a lunch for the seniors.
[772.24 → 775.16] And I was told today, for people who want to hang out with the seniors.
[776.12 → 778.46] So if you're just looking for a free lunch and have time,
[778.84 → 781.96] on December, what did we say that was?
[782.76 → 783.20] 17.
[783.52 → 783.94] Thank you.
[784.42 → 789.60] December 17, there's a sign-up sheet that will be at the Connect booth at the back.
[790.74 → 793.42] Seniors and senior adjacent and friends.
[793.88 → 794.62] You're all welcome.
[795.10 → 796.44] Just sign up in advance.
[796.44 → 805.94] And last, nope, second to last, we are looking for some more people to sign up for the clean-up
[805.94 → 812.78] that's going to take place after the craft fair and bake sale on December 6th.
[812.78 → 815.06] So that will be in here on Saturday.
[815.32 → 817.70] All day long, different vendors and things like that.
[817.78 → 819.68] Many of you have signed up to participate in that.
[819.68 → 827.16] We need some people to clean up and reset the space so that we can worship well on Sunday.
[827.58 → 832.08] And so if you're interested in helping for the clean-up, please talk to Miriam De Winter.
[832.42 → 833.30] She's at the back.
[833.38 → 834.28] She's going to wave her hand.
[834.90 → 835.68] Miriam back there.
[836.02 → 836.76] It's also my mother.
[837.20 → 838.56] So make sure you talk to her well.
[839.42 → 841.06] She's serving coffee after church.
[841.12 → 842.82] So if you're looking for her, she'll be in the kitchen.
[842.82 → 848.96] And if you're able to help with chairs on December 6th in the evening, resetting those, please talk to Rob.
[849.42 → 850.98] He's around here somewhere too.
[852.24 → 852.92] He's in the back.
[853.12 → 854.12] Anyway, talk to Rob.
[854.20 → 855.48] He'll get you with the chairs.
[855.48 → 872.48] Lastly, we are hoping to have a bit of a concert band slash brass and woodwind instrument ensemble for Christmas Day.
[873.32 → 878.68] And so if you play a brass instrument or a woodwind instrument or a traditional concert band instrument,
[879.14 → 881.60] would you talk to Pastor Kevin after the service?
[881.60 → 889.00] And we can get your information down and put you on the list and get that ready for Christmas Day.
[889.24 → 891.76] We'd love to see that happening here as well.
[892.24 → 893.18] I think that's it.
[893.26 → 893.90] Kevin, am I right?
[894.66 → 894.90] Yep.
[895.08 → 895.36] All right.
[895.46 → 896.10] Linda, are you here?
[896.14 → 896.52] Am I right?
[897.40 → 898.02] Linda's not here?
[898.10 → 898.36] Perfect.
[898.54 → 898.70] Okay.
[899.44 → 905.32] Well then, let's stand and be ushered into God's presence together.
[905.32 → 916.28] Following God's greeting, I'm going to invite you to turn to those around you and welcome them in our worship.
[916.68 → 922.20] And then we will have Bert and Weak come up, and they'll lead us in the Advent candle lighting.
[922.64 → 924.54] Receive the greeting of our God.
[924.54 → 929.28] Grace, mercy, and peace to you.
[929.78 → 936.38] From God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, Son, and our Saviour, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[937.30 → 937.66] Amen.
[954.54 → 961.54] Okay.
[961.54 → 962.34] It's our big one.
[962.56 → 963.68] There's a big one in the middle.
[964.12 → 964.94] There's two in one in the middle.
[965.36 → 966.52] It's not the purple one?
[966.60 → 967.94] No, it's one of the purple ones.
[968.04 → 968.66] That's what I thought.
[968.88 → 969.02] Yeah.
[969.02 → 969.08] Yeah.
[969.16 → 969.90] The pink one.
[970.58 → 972.18] Yes, this is the first one.
[973.38 → 974.26] Where did you say that?
[974.66 → 974.92] No.
[975.42 → 975.60] No.
[976.92 → 977.60] It's purple.
[978.92 → 979.74] Yeah, we're purple.
[980.16 → 980.84] Yes, I know.
[980.94 → 981.24] And you.
[981.48 → 981.96] Okay.
[981.96 → 984.00] Okay.
[989.00 → 989.98] When do we start?
[990.38 → 990.74] Now.
[990.74 → 992.86] Whenever you want to do it.
[992.86 → 999.52] Today we light the candle of hope.
[1001.12 → 1008.92] Like Elizabeth, Zechariah, Simeon, and Anna, we wait with patience for God to keep his promises.
[1008.92 → 1014.46] We hope of the Lord, for his word is sure.
[1014.62 → 1015.50] Yeah, yeah, it's in there.
[1015.68 → 1016.26] Yeah, it's there.
[1019.14 → 1023.74] As this candle burns, we remember, our waiting is not in vain.
[1024.52 → 1025.50] Christ is our hope.
[1025.50 → 1037.78] And we options'll make yes.
[1037.78 → 1038.82] Phenomenal musically
[1038.82 → 1040.00] Situation
[1040.14 → 1040.84] Program
[1040.84 → 1070.82] O come, O come, Emmanuel, and ransom captive Israel.
[1070.84 → 1086.48] And mourns in lonely exile, until the Son of God appear.
[1086.48 → 1103.66] Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel, shall come to thee, O Israel.
[1103.66 → 1115.54] O come, O wisdom, come on earth.
[1115.54 → 1122.88] O Lord, all things are all right to lead.
[1123.52 → 1130.54] To us the path of knowledge show.
[1130.54 → 1138.46] And it shall see its ways to go.
[1139.18 → 1154.54] Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel, shall come to thee, O Israel.
[1154.54 → 1166.72] O come, thou branch of Jesse's stem.
[1166.72 → 1173.72] Come to thine own and rescue them.
[1175.16 → 1182.10] From depths of hell your people save.
[1182.10 → 1190.24] And give them victory o'er the grave.
[1191.24 → 1206.10] Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel, shall come to thee, O Israel.
[1206.10 → 1218.28] O come, O brightened morning star.
[1218.28 → 1225.28] And bring us comfort, Father, above all.
[1225.28 → 1233.28] Discount the shadows of the night.
[1233.28 → 1241.28] And turn our darkness into light.
[1241.28 → 1258.28] Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel, shall come to thee, O Israel.
[1258.28 → 1277.28] Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel, shall come to thee, O Israel.
[1277.28 → 1307.26] Rejoice, Emmanuel, shall come to thee, O Israel.
[1307.26 → 1314.26] All the earth make straight a pathway path for the Lord.
[1314.26 → 1320.26] Jesus is coming, Saviour.
[1320.26 → 1328.26] Call back the sinner, wake up the saint.
[1328.26 → 1333.26] Let every nation shout at your fame.
[1333.26 → 1335.26] Jesus is coming soon.
[1335.26 → 1340.26] Jesus is coming soon.
[1340.26 → 1347.26] Like a bride waiting forever.
[1347.26 → 1348.26] Amen.
[1348.26 → 1352.26] The Lord, we'll be a church ready for you.
[1352.26 → 1353.26] Every heart longing for our King.
[1353.26 → 1355.26] Peace sing.
[1355.26 → 1368.26] Even so come, Lord Jesus come.
[1368.26 → 1376.08] Even so come, Lord Jesus come
[1376.08 → 1384.16] There will be justice, all will be new
[1384.16 → 1388.68] Your name forever, faithful and true
[1388.68 → 1394.62] Jesus is coming soon
[1398.26 → 1403.18] Like a bride waiting for her
[1403.18 → 1409.56] We'll be a church ready for you every night
[1409.56 → 1415.06] Longing for our King, we sing
[1415.06 → 1422.56] Even so come, Lord Jesus come
[1422.56 → 1431.48] Even so come, Lord Jesus come
[1431.48 → 1458.18] So we wait, we wait for you
[1458.18 → 1467.02] But we wait, you're coming soon
[1467.02 → 1475.68] So we wait, we wait for you
[1475.68 → 1484.52] But we wait, you're coming soon
[1484.52 → 1493.18] So we wait, we wait for you
[1493.18 → 1502.02] But we wait, you're coming soon
[1502.02 → 1510.18] So we wait, we wait for you
[1510.18 → 1519.02] Don't we wait, we're coming soon
[1519.02 → 1527.86] Like a bride waiting for our King, we sing
[1527.86 → 1536.70] Like a bride waiting for our King, we sing
[1536.70 → 1545.54] We'll be a church ready for our King, we sing
[1545.54 → 1548.72] We'll be a church ready for you every night
[1548.72 → 1553.54] Longing for our King, we sing
[1553.54 → 1560.66] Even so come, Lord Jesus come
[1560.66 → 1569.50] Even so come, Lord Jesus come
[1569.50 → 1579.50] Even so come, Lord Jesus come
[1579.50 → 1581.56] I invite you to be seated
[1581.56 → 1590.84] In Psalm 130 we read
[1590.84 → 1595.00] Out of the depths I cry to you, Lord
[1595.00 → 1598.14] Lord, hear my voice
[1598.14 → 1602.42] Let your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy
[1602.42 → 1605.90] If you, Lord, kept a record of sins
[1605.90 → 1608.10] Lord, who could stand
[1608.10 → 1610.56] But with you there is forgiveness
[1610.56 → 1614.94] So that we can, with reverence, serve you
[1614.94 → 1633.76] Be still and know that I am God
[1633.76 → 1642.54] Be still and know that I am God
[1642.54 → 1651.28] Be still and know that I am God
[1651.28 → 1661.86] In Thee, O Lord, I put my trust
[1661.86 → 1670.36] In Thee, O Lord, I put my trust
[1670.36 → 1679.26] In Thee, O Lord, I put my trust
[1679.26 → 1689.10] Be still and know that I am God
[1689.10 → 1697.68] Be still and know that I am God
[1697.68 → 1706.42] Be still and know that I am God
[1706.42 → 1712.86] Let's stand to hear words of assurance
[1712.86 → 1715.46] As Psalm 130 continues
[1715.46 → 1722.00] I wait for the Lord
[1722.00 → 1724.20] My whole being waits
[1724.20 → 1727.72] And in His word I put my hope
[1727.72 → 1731.86] I wait for the Lord more than watchmen for the morning
[1731.86 → 1734.70] More than watchmen for the morning
[1734.70 → 1739.12] Church of Jesus Christ, let's put our hope in the Lord
[1739.12 → 1742.02] For with the Lord is unfailing love
[1742.02 → 1744.46] And with Him is full redemption
[1744.46 → 1748.76] He Himself has redeemed us from all our sins
[1748.76 → 1762.00] Out of the depths I cry to you
[1762.00 → 1776.14] Out of the depths I cry to you
[1776.14 → 1781.38] In darkest places I will call
[1781.38 → 1786.26] Incline your ear to me anew
[1786.26 → 1791.56] And hear my cry for mercy, Lord
[1791.56 → 1797.10] Were you to count my sinful ways
[1797.10 → 1801.88] How could I come before your throne
[1801.88 → 1807.42] Yet whole forgiveness meets my gaze
[1807.42 → 1812.02] I stand redeemed by grace alone
[1812.02 → 1815.16] I will wait for you
[1815.16 → 1817.66] I will wait for you
[1817.66 → 1819.74] On your word
[1819.74 → 1822.40] I will be alive
[1822.40 → 1825.38] I will wait for you
[1825.38 → 1827.80] Surely wait for you
[1827.80 → 1831.72] Till my soul is satisfied
[1831.72 → 1843.96] So put your hope in God alone
[1843.96 → 1849.20] Take courage in His power to save
[1849.20 → 1854.02] Completely and forever won
[1854.02 → 1859.18] By Christ emerging from the grave
[1859.18 → 1860.18] I will wait for you
[1860.18 → 1861.18] I will wait for you
[1861.18 → 1862.18] I will wait for you
[1862.18 → 1864.18] I will wait for you
[1864.18 → 1866.18] On your word
[1866.18 → 1869.18] I will be alive
[1869.18 → 1871.18] I will wait for you
[1871.18 → 1872.18] I will wait for you
[1872.18 → 1874.18] Only wait for you
[1874.18 → 1878.18] Till my soul is satisfied
[1878.18 → 1889.18] His steadfast love has made a way
[1889.18 → 1895.18] And God Himself has paid the price
[1895.18 → 1899.18] Let all who trust in Him today
[1899.18 → 1905.18] Find healing in His sacrifice
[1905.18 → 1906.18] I will wait for you
[1906.18 → 1908.18] I will wait for you
[1908.18 → 1910.18] I will wait for you
[1910.18 → 1912.18] Through the storm
[1912.18 → 1915.18] And through the night
[1915.18 → 1917.18] I will wait for you
[1917.18 → 1920.18] Surely wait for you
[1920.18 → 1924.18] For your love is my delight
[1924.18 → 1927.18] I will wait for you
[1927.18 → 1938.18] I will wait for you
[1938.18 → 1940.18] I will wait for you
[1940.18 → 1949.18] Heavens adore
[1949.18 → 1950.18] You
[1950.18 → 1960.76] Out of the depths I cry to you, in the darkest places I will call.
[1961.52 → 1971.76] Incline your ear to me anew, and hear my cry for mercy, Lord.
[1980.18 → 1981.18] Amen.
[2010.18 → 2012.18] Amen.
[2040.18 → 2042.18] Amen.
[2070.18 → 2072.18] Oh.
[2083.26 → 2085.26] Oh.
[2085.26 → 2090.00] How strong deliver
[2090.00 → 2096.54] You are the everlasting God
[2096.54 → 2100.62] The everlasting God
[2100.62 → 2104.58] Do not need to walk
[2104.58 → 2108.10] Only me
[2108.10 → 2112.62] But I'll defend my own for me
[2112.62 → 2116.66] You have the thousand weeks
[2116.66 → 2120.62] You lift us up on weight
[2120.62 → 2123.62] I feel lost
[2124.16 → 2128.62] You are the everlasting God
[2128.62 → 2132.62] The everlasting God
[2132.62 → 2136.58] You do not make you want
[2136.58 → 2139.62] Go with me
[2139.62 → 2143.62] You are the everlasting God
[2143.62 → 2145.62] You are the everlasting God
[2145.62 → 2147.62] You are the everlasting God
[2147.62 → 2149.62] You are the everlasting God
[2149.62 → 2151.62] You lift us up on weight
[2151.62 → 2155.62] I need God
[2155.62 → 2157.62] You are our everlasting God
[2157.62 → 2161.62] You are the everlasting God
[2161.62 → 2163.62] You are the everlasting God
[2163.62 → 2165.62] You are the everlasting God
[2165.62 → 2167.62] You are the everlasting God
[2167.62 → 2169.62] You are the everlasting God
[2169.62 → 2171.62] You are the everlasting God
[2171.62 → 2173.62] Good morning everyone. My name is Warren Heroes
[2173.62 → 2175.62] And I serve as a Deacon here at Langley Emanuel.
[2175.62 → 2179.62] At this time, we'll worship God through our gifts and offerings.
[2179.62 → 2186.72] And as we prepare to give, let's reflect on the text in the e-bulletin from Hebrews 13, verse 16,
[2187.48 → 2188.10] which reads,
[2188.26 → 2193.36] And do not forget to do good and share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.
[2193.86 → 2199.02] Our special offering for today is for Resonate, which is the official missions arm of the CRC.
[2199.84 → 2205.22] Resonate seeks the advancement of God's mission of spreading the gospel through the entire world.
[2205.22 → 2213.34] And it does so by church planting and missionary training and campus ministries and other leadership training.
[2213.76 → 2218.68] And it does so in 40 plus countries around the world, as well as here in Canada and even locally here in BC.
[2219.46 → 2224.42] You may also give to the general budget, which supports the various missions of this church.
[2225.16 → 2233.20] Just please ensure that all gifts for the general budget are marked as such as all unmarked gifts will be assigned to the special offering.
[2233.20 → 2235.82] Let's give as the Lord has blessed us. Thank you.
[2235.82 → 2236.82] Thank you.
[2263.20 → 2264.20] Thank you.
[2264.20 → 2265.20] Thank you.
[2265.48 → 2266.20] Thank you.
[2266.20 → 2267.20] Thank you.
[2267.20 → 2270.82] Are you hurting and broken within?
[2271.66 → 2275.60] Overwhelmed by the wake of your sin?
[2276.18 → 2278.24] Jesus is calling.
[2281.00 → 2285.62] Have you come to the end of the sound?
[2286.48 → 2290.22] Do you thirst for the drink from the breath?
[2290.22 → 2291.22] Jesus is calling.
[2291.22 → 2292.22] Jesus is calling.
[2292.22 → 2293.22] Jesus is calling.
[2293.22 → 2295.22] Oh, come to the altar.
[2295.22 → 2299.22] Oh, come to the altar.
[2299.22 → 2315.22] The Father's altar open while forgiveness was born with the precious one of Jesus Christ.
[2315.22 → 2316.22] Jesus is calling.
[2316.22 → 2320.22] Jesus is calling.
[2324.22 → 2326.22] Jesus is calling.
[2326.22 → 2329.58] Your regrets in the sigh tech
[2329.94 → 2333.76] Come, today, this is reason to wait
[2334.20 → 2337.96] Jesus is called to You
[2339.30 → 2343.70] In the sorrows who enjoyment joy
[2344.04 → 2348.18] Upon the ashes, youth among the war
[2348.52 → 2351.82] Jesus is called to You
[2351.82 → 2361.86] Come to the altar, the Father's arms are open wide
[2361.86 → 2370.82] Forgiveness, the Lord with the precious blood of Jesus Christ
[2371.50 → 2380.82] Come to the altar, the Father's arms are open wide
[2380.82 → 2390.82] Forgiveness, the Lord with the precious blood of Jesus Christ
[2390.82 → 2410.36] Oh, what a safe love, isn't He wonderful?
[2410.36 → 2418.36] Sing, hallelujah, Christ is risen
[2418.36 → 2428.36] God will be pardoned, glory and glory of God
[2428.36 → 2434.36] Sing, hallelujah, Christ is risen
[2434.36 → 2446.12] Oh, what a safe love, isn't He wonderful?
[2446.36 → 2452.36] Sing, hallelujah, Christ is risen
[2452.36 → 2462.36] Come on before Him, glory is God
[2462.36 → 2470.36] Sing, hallelujah, Christ is risen
[2470.36 → 2476.36] Come on before Him, glory is risen
[2476.36 → 2484.36] Come to the altar, the Father's eyes are open wide
[2484.36 → 2492.36] Forgiveness, the Lord with the precious blood of Jesus Christ
[2492.36 → 2513.36] Oh, come to the altar. The Father's arms are all divine. Forgiveness is poured within the precious blood of Jesus Christ.
[2513.36 → 2532.36] Hear your cross as you wait for the crown. Tell the world of the treasure you find.
[2543.36 → 2556.78] We are ready already. I would love to invite all the kids who are age 3 to grade 4 or anybody else to come up to the front right now.
[2556.78 → 2560.64] We're going to do some kids' corner before we head to children's worship time.
[2571.42 → 2572.68] Good morning, everybody.
[2573.80 → 2578.04] How's everybody doing today? Good? Guess what we're going to talk about today?
[2578.12 → 2587.20] We're going to talk about two different couples who had to wait for a long time for Jesus to come.
[2588.32 → 2593.38] But the promise that they were given came true because they were so patient and waited.
[2593.82 → 2598.08] And I have a friend who knows a little bit about waiting. Should we invite him out?
[2598.54 → 2600.26] Let's invite him out. Say, come on out, Hank!
[2600.26 → 2601.60] Come on, Hank!
[2602.64 → 2603.68] Come on, Hank!
[2605.02 → 2605.30] Oh!
[2606.86 → 2607.14] What?
[2609.14 → 2609.38] What?
[2609.94 → 2611.20] Who is that?
[2613.58 → 2614.62] I'm out of hands!
[2614.72 → 2615.62] Who is that?
[2617.02 → 2617.46] Henrietta?
[2619.22 → 2619.62] Henrietta?
[2619.70 → 2621.40] Henrietta, it's so good to see you!
[2621.60 → 2623.06] It's been a long time.
[2623.40 → 2625.30] I hope that I can see you!
[2625.30 → 2626.46] We'll have to go.
[2626.72 → 2628.52] Everybody stand up and look at Henrietta.
[2631.42 → 2634.06] Henrietta's my long-lost cousin, I think.
[2637.34 → 2639.58] I've been waiting so long to see her.
[2639.66 → 2641.24] It's so good to see you again.
[2643.26 → 2645.48] We'll catch up after church, okay?
[2646.32 → 2646.84] Okay.
[2647.20 → 2648.48] Good to see you, Henrietta.
[2649.42 → 2650.76] All right, sit down, sit down.
[2650.76 → 2656.56] Well, Hank, that is something.
[2656.72 → 2657.76] Henrietta, yeah!
[2658.10 → 2660.04] I haven't seen her in years!
[2660.38 → 2661.32] That's so exciting.
[2661.94 → 2663.80] I've also been waiting for something else.
[2663.90 → 2664.18] I know.
[2664.30 → 2665.32] You know what I did with Hank?
[2665.58 → 2667.54] He is an expert at waiting,
[2667.68 → 2670.64] because I've been making him wait for a treat.
[2670.94 → 2671.40] Yeah!
[2671.90 → 2672.90] A long time.
[2673.00 → 2674.48] Hank, how long have you been waiting for this treat?
[2675.50 → 2676.76] 47 minutes!
[2678.28 → 2678.76] 47 minutes!
[2678.76 → 2679.34] 47 minutes!
[2679.62 → 2682.32] Yeah, but that's like 47 in dog years!
[2682.92 → 2684.16] 47 years!
[2684.66 → 2685.38] I was like, well, maybe.
[2685.46 → 2686.96] I don't know how the puppet dog years work,
[2687.10 → 2688.24] but we can say, sure.
[2688.72 → 2690.70] What have you been waiting for?
[2690.88 → 2693.60] I was promised there would be a bone,
[2693.82 → 2695.46] but I'm an excellent waiter,
[2696.00 → 2697.90] not the kind of waiter who carries food.
[2697.96 → 2699.26] I spill that all the time.
[2699.50 → 2700.44] My hands don't work,
[2700.70 → 2702.66] but I'm perfect at waiting for things.
[2702.74 → 2703.08] Watch!
[2703.28 → 2704.26] All right, Hank, wait!
[2704.26 → 2704.32] Wait!
[2704.32 → 2704.36] Wait!
[2704.36 → 2704.40] Wait!
[2704.40 → 2704.42] Wait!
[2704.42 → 2704.44] Wait!
[2704.44 → 2704.48] Wait!
[2704.48 → 2704.52] Wait!
[2704.52 → 2706.40] Wait!
[2706.40 → 2706.44] Wait!
[2706.44 → 2708.74] Wait!
[2709.44 → 2710.36] Pretty good, right?
[2710.36 → 2711.76] Pretty good, isn't it?
[2711.88 → 2712.56] Hank, sit!
[2713.96 → 2715.66] Oh, that's good, too.
[2716.44 → 2717.26] Hank, speak!
[2717.48 → 2717.76] Okay!
[2718.22 → 2719.38] I can talk for a while.
[2719.72 → 2721.00] When I was little...
[2721.00 → 2721.48] Hank, that's good.
[2722.80 → 2725.56] I have a treat for you here on stage,
[2725.64 → 2727.12] but you haven't been able to find it yet,
[2727.18 → 2727.60] have you?
[2727.80 → 2728.22] No!
[2728.68 → 2729.66] Did you look really hard?
[2729.78 → 2731.72] I looked so hard!
[2732.06 → 2733.56] Should we walk to where the treat is, Hank?
[2733.68 → 2734.36] Yes, please!
[2734.36 → 2737.28] Now, Hank had to wait a long time for this treat,
[2737.60 → 2740.50] just like the people in the Bible stories that we're going to look at.
[2741.04 → 2745.28] Zachariah and Elizabeth and Anna and Simeon had to wait a long time for Jesus.
[2745.86 → 2748.72] And so, Hank, your treat is all the way over here.
[2751.10 → 2752.44] I think I found it!
[2752.74 → 2753.78] It's in the bag!
[2755.78 → 2756.96] Can you pull it out?
[2756.96 → 2757.04] Oops!
[2759.96 → 2760.20] Huh?
[2761.16 → 2762.26] A bone!
[2766.34 → 2767.08] Thank you!
[2768.38 → 2769.44] That is so good!
[2769.54 → 2770.20] So yummy!
[2770.60 → 2774.22] All right, we're going to go talk a little bit more about what it means to wait
[2774.22 → 2776.68] and have our promises answered by God.
[2777.48 → 2779.80] And so, we're going to go to children's worship time to do that, okay?
[2780.64 → 2781.70] All right, let's pray.
[2782.06 → 2784.74] Before we stand up, let's pray, and then we'll do the Lord's blessing, okay?
[2785.34 → 2785.84] Let's pray.
[2785.84 → 2786.78] Bow our heads, close our eyes.
[2787.14 → 2788.72] Dear God, thank you so much for this day.
[2788.82 → 2789.90] Thank you that we could come to church,
[2790.36 → 2792.50] and we could learn more about what it means to follow you.
[2792.84 → 2796.08] We pray that you'll be with us now as we're in children's worship time
[2796.08 → 2799.86] and be with the grown-ups as well as we learn about what it means to wait for you.
[2800.12 → 2801.06] We pray this in your name.
[2801.66 → 2802.02] Amen.
[2802.88 → 2803.64] All right, stand up.
[2803.70 → 2804.18] Don't run yet.
[2804.24 → 2804.80] Don't run yet.
[2806.08 → 2806.70] Stand up.
[2806.78 → 2807.26] Stand up.
[2808.40 → 2810.02] We're going to do the kids' blessings.
[2810.28 → 2812.44] So, we're going to say, the Lord be with you, okay?
[2812.50 → 2812.86] Are you ready?
[2813.46 → 2814.16] And go.
[2814.16 → 2816.46] The Lord be with you.
[2816.46 → 2818.34] And also be with you.
[2820.22 → 2821.56] I'll do my feet now.
[2827.56 → 2832.30] Parents, just so you know, your kids will be joining you back in the service right after the sermon
[2832.30 → 2833.72] or towards the end of the sermon.
[2833.86 → 2838.12] So, I'm just letting you know they'll be joining you for the last two songs today as well.
[2838.20 → 2841.00] So, that's anybody who's in grade one to four will be coming back to their seats.
[2841.00 → 2862.02] I'm going to read a book today.
[2862.02 → 2863.90] Is that okay?
[2863.90 → 2863.96] Okay?
[2863.96 → 2864.96] I'm joking.
[2864.96 → 2866.96] I'm joking.
[2866.96 → 2868.96] I'm joking.
[2868.96 → 2870.96] I'm joking.
[2870.96 → 2871.96] I'm joking.
[2871.96 → 2872.96] I'm joking.
[2872.96 → 2873.96] I'm joking.
[2873.96 → 2874.96] I'm joking.
[2874.96 → 2881.00] from Council. Thank you to everyone who came out Monday night to the fall general
[2881.00 → 2886.14] meeting. We had a strong turnout and are grateful for the support for our church
[2886.14 → 2891.80] family. We also had a lovely dinner together. I guess if you count soup as
[2891.80 → 2897.90] dinner that's okay. Had a lovely dinner together and a budget for 2026 was
[2897.90 → 2905.66] approved. I just want to make a comment about there's been two Wednesday night
[2905.66 → 2909.30] services already. I went to the first one I couldn't make the second one. The third
[2909.30 → 2913.96] one is on December the 10th. So the first time it was about 35 people, second time
[2913.96 → 2922.50] about 22, and we'll see the third. I absolutely enjoyed that service. Very
[2922.50 → 2928.80] informal, very participating with the speaker and whoever was praying or
[2928.80 → 2935.16] singing or whatever. It was awesome. If you need a midweek pick me up, there's your
[2935.16 → 2941.58] place. This morning it's my turn to pray. Actually it wasn't but somebody else
[2941.58 → 2947.24] couldn't make it so here you got me. I want to pray for the people that had
[2947.24 → 2952.32] surgeries and successful surgeries and that they get a further complete
[2952.32 → 2960.78] recovery. Also want to pray especially for the shut-ins. We have a few and yeah
[2960.78 → 2965.94] it's its it's got to be hard. And then praying for deal people that are dealing
[2965.94 → 2970.38] with other issues as well. And there's something else I got to do before I pray
[2970.38 → 2977.80] and it's apologize. We have a friend that comes here from Guatemala and I made
[2977.80 → 2981.60] some kind of arrangement to pick him up, and I thought because it was sunny today I
[2981.60 → 2987.12] just drove right past, and he's not here. So I apologize. I'll apologize to him when I
[2987.12 → 2997.20] see him. Let's pray. Father in heaven Lord, your Lord we ask you for your
[2997.20 → 3005.94] guidance. You give it and Lord do we comply? Do we, are ears open? Sometimes yes,
[3005.94 → 3012.36] sometimes no. Lord, we thank you that we can worship you this beautiful sunny
[3012.36 → 3019.20] morning. We pray will you be with each one of us Lord. We thank you for carrying us
[3019.20 → 3025.40] through this past week and whatever we experienced Lord whether it was an
[3025.40 → 3031.86] operation or a visit or whatever Lord. Lord, you know us. You know each one of us
[3031.86 → 3042.16] better than we know ourselves Lord. You know when we call out your name, and you know when we
[3042.16 → 3048.84] hide, and we don't do that. Lord, we thank you so much that we can celebrate Christmas again
[3048.84 → 3058.64] every year Lord and then comes Easter. Lord, we thank you for all you did. We think about the history,
[3058.64 → 3065.36] your history, our history, our history. We think about your word Lord. Furthermore, we think about this world and the
[3065.36 → 3071.02] the chaos that seems to be happening all around us, but that hasn't changed a lot Lord. Because when you
[3071.02 → 3077.42] brought the flood you saved just eight people and how many were not saved? Sodom and Gomorrah Lord you
[3077.42 → 3084.60] you just wiped them out. You haven't changed. Lord, we pray will you help us to wake up
[3084.60 → 3091.72] to know that you are in total control even though things don't go the way we would like it.
[3092.60 → 3100.26] Lord we pray will you help us this week maybe to spend some time talking with you Lord and listening
[3100.26 → 3106.50] and again this morning Lord. Pray will you help us to listen. Please be with Chris Lord. Please be with
[3106.50 → 3112.04] your word. Please help it to resonate with all of us. Thank you in Jesus name. Amen.
[3112.50 → 3113.50] Amen.
[3113.50 → 3143.26] This Advent and Christmas season we are going to be looking at what we're calling the
[3143.26 → 3148.94] cast of Christmas. That is the different people who are involved in the different stories
[3148.94 → 3157.28] around the first coming of our Lord Jesus. And so this morning we're going to focus on
[3157.28 → 3165.68] four people that are introduced to us in the Gospel of Luke. And so I'm going to invite you to turn
[3165.68 → 3174.38] in your Bibles or on your devices to Luke 1, and we're going to read verse 5 through 25, and then we're
[3174.38 → 3188.50] going to turn over to Luke 2 and read verses 25 to 38. Let's read Luke 1 starting at verse 5.
[3188.50 → 3199.42] In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah who belonged to the priestly
[3199.42 → 3207.66] division of Abijah. His wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron. Both of them were righteous
[3207.66 → 3215.36] in the sight of God observing all the Lord's commands and decrees blamelessly. But they were childless
[3215.36 → 3224.12] because Elizabeth was not able to conceive, and they were both very old. Once when Zechariah's
[3224.12 → 3231.02] division was on duty, and he was serving as priest before God he was chosen by lot according to the
[3231.02 → 3238.06] custom of the priesthood to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. And when the time for the
[3238.06 → 3245.34] burning of incense came all the assembled worshippers were praying outside. Then the angel of the Lord
[3245.34 → 3251.96] appeared to him standing on the right side of the altar of incense. When Zechariah saw him he was
[3251.96 → 3259.38] startled and was gripped with fear. But the angel said to him, do not be afraid Zechariah your prayer
[3259.38 → 3266.54] has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John. He will be a joy
[3266.54 → 3272.36] and delight to you and many will rejoice because of his birth for he will be great in the sight of the
[3272.36 → 3278.26] Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit
[3278.26 → 3284.04] even before he is born. He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God
[3284.04 → 3290.58] and he will go on before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the parents
[3290.58 → 3296.80] to their children and the disobedience to the wisdom of the righteous to make ready a people prepared
[3296.80 → 3305.40] for the Lord. Zechariah asked the angel, how can this, how can I be sure of this? I am an old man
[3305.40 → 3313.36] and my wife is well along in years. The angel said to him, I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God
[3313.36 → 3320.58] and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news. And now you will be silent and not
[3320.58 → 3326.96] able to speak until the day this happens because you did not believe my words which will come true
[3326.96 → 3334.10] at their appointed time. Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he had stayed
[3334.10 → 3340.84] so long in the temple and when he came out he could not speak to them. They realized that he had seen a
[3340.84 → 3348.36] vision in the temple for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak. When his time of
[3348.36 → 3356.08] service was completed he returned home and after this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five
[3356.08 → 3364.20] months remained in seclusion. The Lord has done this for me, she said. In these days he has shown his favour
[3364.20 → 3375.44] and taken away my disgrace among the people. And now we're going to turn to chapter 2 and starting at
[3375.44 → 3380.26] verse 25. Read through to 38.
[3385.26 → 3392.98] Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the
[3392.98 → 3399.90] consolation of Israel and the Holy Spirit was on him. It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that
[3399.90 → 3407.06] he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Messiah. Moved by the Spirit he went into the temple courts.
[3407.94 → 3414.54] When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what was custom, what the custom of the law
[3414.54 → 3422.16] required, Simeon took him in his arms and praised God saying, Sovereign Lord as you have promised you may now
[3422.16 → 3429.30] dismiss your servant in peace. For my eyes have seen your salvation which you have prepared in the sight
[3429.30 → 3435.72] of all nations, a light for revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of your people Israel.
[3437.12 → 3445.12] The child's father and mother marvelled at what was said about him. Then Simeon blessed them and said to
[3445.12 → 3452.64] marry his mother, this child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel and to be a
[3452.64 → 3459.92] sign that will be spoken against so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed, and a sword will
[3459.92 → 3469.30] pierce your own soul too. There was also a prophet, Anna, the daughter of Panel of the tribe of Asher.
[3469.30 → 3476.46] She was very old. She had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage and then was a widow
[3476.46 → 3483.66] until she was 84. She never left the temple but worshipped night and day, fasting and praying.
[3484.28 → 3489.96] Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who
[3489.96 → 3495.70] were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem. This is the word of the Lord.
[3499.30 → 3513.40] We often talk about Christmas as a season of hope and joy and excitement where we sing joy to the world
[3513.40 → 3526.16] but Advent is a season of waiting, of expectation, and I'm quite sure that in this season that some of us
[3526.16 → 3535.38] are crying out, how amazing is life? And some of us are crying out, how long is this season of life
[3535.38 → 3545.52] going to be? And maybe you're coming into this Advent season of waiting, carrying unanswered prayers.
[3546.30 → 3554.76] Maybe you've got unresolved questions. Maybe there's this idea or this wondering that has just been
[3554.76 → 3560.90] niggling in the back of your mind, and you keep fighting to tamp it down, but it's always there in the
[3560.90 → 3571.14] recesses of your mental space. Where is God? Has God forgotten me? Has he passed me by? Have I missed him?
[3572.40 → 3578.96] Now, of course, most of us here, especially if you're here regularly, like we know the right response in
[3578.96 → 3584.50] that moment, we know the right answer, the right posture. We know that God is always faithful, that he
[3584.50 → 3592.74] always keeps his promises, but then the years go by and nothing seems to change. In our homes, in our
[3592.74 → 3602.46] marriages, in our bodies, in our children, in our work, in our world. And in those moments, hope can start to feel
[3602.46 → 3612.60] like something for other people. That they get to have it, but I don't. That hope starts to feel like
[3612.60 → 3618.48] it's something for the lucky ones, the ones who have it all together, the families who show up and
[3618.48 → 3625.18] whose kids are perfectly dressed and have their ties nicely tightened around their neck. Not my family who
[3625.18 → 3630.56] has kids crawling all over the floor and running around and not listening to me, let alone to the person
[3630.56 → 3639.34] on stage. Hope is for them because they've got it all figured out. Right? Hope is for the ones that
[3639.34 → 3647.08] God seems to bless more regularly than he does for me. And maybe if you carry that into this season,
[3647.24 → 3654.08] you know the ache of feeling forgotten by God or feeling overlooked in his plan or like somehow you have
[3654.08 → 3663.64] missed out on something. And for you, this story matters. Right? God didn't start the first Christmas
[3663.64 → 3671.64] story with the impressive or influential people, with the loud and the powerful. He started with the
[3671.64 → 3678.74] overlooked and the forgotten, with the outcasts and the ignored. He started with those who had waited
[3678.74 → 3686.58] so long that they never expected for anything to happen. He started with people who carry this ache
[3686.58 → 3695.32] that some of us know all too well. And this morning we're going to dive into four of those stories of
[3695.32 → 3707.38] Zechariah, Elizabeth, Simeon, and Anna. Four quiet lives. Four faithful but wounded hearts. Four people who lived
[3707.38 → 3716.62] most of their story long before Jesus ever arrived on the scene. And each of these four embody a different
[3716.62 → 3727.12] shade or aspect of this same longing, this ache of waiting, a feeling forgotten or overlooked in his plan,
[3727.54 → 3735.76] just waiting a lifetime for something. Now these are not perfect people by any means,
[3735.76 → 3744.78] but they are faithful people. They're honest people. In the end, they're hopeful people, but it's a hope
[3744.78 → 3752.82] that is hard won in their lives. And in Advent, these are precisely the people that God lifts for us
[3752.82 → 3761.26] to see. Because their stories show us that waiting is not punishment, delay is not abandonment, and the years
[3761.26 → 3767.22] that feel wasted are so often the years that God is quietly preparing.
[3768.76 → 3771.00] And so let's start with Zechariah and Elizabeth.
[3772.06 → 3778.92] We read early on there that Zechariah is a priest in the temple, and that both he and his wife Elizabeth
[3778.92 → 3785.04] are descendants of Aaron, which means they're part of the Levitical class.
[3785.04 → 3795.06] And specifically within that, Zechariah is part of the priests in the Levitical class. They're in the line of Abijah,
[3795.38 → 3806.18] who we know was chosen by Lot from out of the Levites to serve with 24 other groups, clans of the
[3806.18 → 3812.36] descendants of Levi and Aaron, to serve in the sanctuary and in the presence of God.
[3812.36 → 3823.32] Now, by the time that Zechariah is serving, there are about 18,000 priests in this order of 24 clans.
[3824.22 → 3832.04] And each priest would serve two one-week periods every year in the temple.
[3832.04 → 3841.98] And then, if they had their lot drawn, they would only officiate the daily offering once in their life.
[3843.26 → 3847.34] And so once their lot was drawn, it would be removed from selection.
[3847.34 → 3858.86] That offering, that the perpetual offering, the incense offering, would be lit at nine in the morning and then at three in the afternoon.
[3859.60 → 3862.30] And it would be an offering of prayer and incense.
[3862.78 → 3871.30] If you have been part of our Through the Bible in a three years reading, you read about this in the book of Leviticus for our last gathering.
[3871.30 → 3880.50] Now, I think the point in emphasizing Elizabeth and Aaron, or Zechariah, sorry, as both coming from the line of Aaron,
[3880.74 → 3889.74] is to highlight, is to bring our attention to their set-apartness, their holiness unto the purposes of God.
[3890.06 → 3894.26] And this is actually confirmed for us in the text that we read in the next line.
[3894.26 → 3912.74] Now, let me be really clear, right, that this does not mean that they were perfect or that they were sinless.
[3913.46 → 3918.70] It does mean that they really loved God, and they tried to live in the ways that he calls him.
[3918.70 → 3927.66] And they did all the right works of atonement and forgiveness according to the law and to the rituals for purity that existed.
[3927.80 → 3931.22] Again, if you read the book of Leviticus with us, you know what that looks like.
[3931.74 → 3939.82] In short, though, it means that their lives matched their heart and their calling.
[3940.92 → 3945.60] To put it another way, their public life matched their private life.
[3945.60 → 3952.34] So not perfect, but living a loving devotion to God.
[3953.70 → 3962.14] Second, because they're called blameless here, I think it's really important for us to see that their childlessness,
[3962.70 → 3967.98] Elizabeth's inability to have a child, is not a punishment for their sin.
[3967.98 → 3975.82] Right, they're old, they're without children, and faithful to God's calling on their life.
[3976.94 → 3985.12] But still, of course, right, Elizabeth especially felt ashamed and heartache at her childlessness.
[3986.06 → 3992.68] Notice in verse 25 of chapter 1, how she talks about her disgrace being taken away.
[3992.68 → 3995.94] But there's a sense of disgrace that she carries.
[3996.06 → 4002.54] Now, there are all sorts of stories throughout the Bible about husbands and wives being unable to have children.
[4003.24 → 4007.38] Right, and the social disgrace that comes as a result of that.
[4007.46 → 4010.84] Part of that comes, we know, from the blessing that children are.
[4010.94 → 4013.80] You can read about that in Psalm 127, for example.
[4013.80 → 4021.80] Part of that comes from the fact that being fruitful and multiplying is tied to what it means to be human and creative,
[4021.80 → 4025.02] as God is a creator, and we are made in his image.
[4025.10 → 4026.58] It comes out of Genesis 1, 2.
[4027.88 → 4034.38] And yet, we also see all the patriarchs of the faith dealt with fertility issues.
[4035.42 → 4041.22] Right, we also see the story of Hannah and Elena as heartbreaking in this context.
[4041.22 → 4049.32] And actually, that story of Hannah and Elena in 1 Samuel seems to be behind the way Luke structures his telling of this story.
[4051.22 → 4058.04] And, honestly, if you've ever struggled with fertility or with an unfulfilled desire for children,
[4058.48 → 4061.84] you know the feeling that Elizabeth is holding in her heart.
[4061.84 → 4071.50] Now, Zechariah 2, for all his blamelessness, of course, still has his own doubts.
[4072.10 → 4074.68] Right, he asks when the angel appears to him, he says,
[4074.84 → 4076.12] How can I be sure of this?
[4076.60 → 4080.20] I'm an old man and my wife is well along in years.
[4080.66 → 4085.10] Now, the text doesn't tell us the tone that he used,
[4085.10 → 4089.58] but the way that Gabriel responds is telling.
[4090.74 → 4092.06] Right, Gabriel says, effectively,
[4092.46 → 4093.64] I am Gabriel.
[4094.06 → 4096.04] I stand in the presence of God.
[4096.20 → 4097.40] He sent me to you.
[4097.90 → 4099.76] It's not just my words you aren't believing.
[4099.88 → 4101.62] It's the ability of God you're doubting.
[4102.32 → 4105.40] And since you don't believe what I said,
[4105.54 → 4106.96] you won't be able to speak.
[4106.96 → 4113.38] Now, that kind of reaction is appropriate when the dismissal,
[4114.04 → 4118.56] when the doubt, when the disbelief from Zechariah is quick and haughty.
[4119.34 → 4121.82] So, again, I think Luke is doing this intentionally.
[4122.80 → 4125.92] It kind of reminds me of the story of Abraham and Sarah
[4125.92 → 4130.16] when God tells them that Sarah will become pregnant in her old age
[4130.16 → 4131.20] and Abraham, too.
[4131.26 → 4132.96] He questions and Sarah laughs.
[4132.96 → 4138.76] But still, even with all of that,
[4138.84 → 4140.78] as far as the characters here go,
[4140.90 → 4142.60] as far as Zechariah and Elizabeth go,
[4142.98 → 4146.00] we have two people who aren't perfect,
[4146.38 → 4148.22] but they are faithful.
[4149.10 → 4151.22] And they're committed to serving God,
[4151.44 → 4152.94] even when it's hard,
[4153.34 → 4155.60] even when their prayers go unanswered.
[4157.14 → 4159.54] Right, here are two people who don't have it all figured out.
[4159.54 → 4162.48] Far from it, but they're trying.
[4162.96 → 4163.70] And they're committed.
[4164.46 → 4166.84] They're committed to the call of God on their life
[4166.84 → 4170.20] and struggling to live it out faithfully.
[4173.48 → 4176.66] Next, we saw Simeon.
[4177.16 → 4181.12] Now, Simeon we know less about than we do Zechariah and Elizabeth.
[4181.72 → 4185.22] Of Simeon, one of the people I read this week
[4185.22 → 4188.52] describes him as an elderly man
[4188.52 → 4191.92] who now steps out of the darkness of the storyline of Scripture
[4191.92 → 4193.92] and onto the main stage.
[4194.82 → 4195.64] And then I would add,
[4195.90 → 4198.50] goes back into the darkness following this moment.
[4198.62 → 4200.30] He has one brief appearance.
[4201.10 → 4204.14] He has no station by which we come to know him.
[4204.22 → 4208.06] He has no place in the social order by which we should know him.
[4208.06 → 4212.94] And yet, we do know that he was righteous and devout.
[4213.06 → 4215.26] We do know that the Holy Spirit was on him
[4215.26 → 4217.74] and we know that he too was waiting.
[4218.48 → 4221.94] Waiting, he says, for the consolation of Israel.
[4222.08 → 4225.54] A phrase that we know means that he was waiting
[4225.54 → 4228.14] for the start of the age of the Messiah,
[4228.58 → 4229.88] the Lord's anointed,
[4230.32 → 4232.10] the one who would save the people.
[4232.20 → 4234.60] He was waiting for God to remember his people,
[4234.60 → 4237.96] to speak again for the age of salvation to become.
[4238.06 → 4242.04] And we read that he was told by the Holy Spirit
[4242.04 → 4244.64] that he would not die until,
[4244.98 → 4247.50] before seeing the Lord's Messiah.
[4248.08 → 4252.08] A promise of God's word that he took to heart
[4252.08 → 4255.44] and that then shaped how he waited.
[4257.42 → 4259.70] And after Simeon, we meet Anna.
[4260.62 → 4262.44] We know that she is a prophet.
[4262.44 → 4264.88] She's probably called a prophet
[4264.88 → 4267.60] because she's always in the temple
[4267.60 → 4270.96] and there she is praying and worshipping and speaking
[4270.96 → 4273.70] to those who we're looking forward to.
[4274.48 → 4277.66] Luke writes it as the redemption of Israel.
[4278.50 → 4282.12] And we're told that she too is very old.
[4282.60 → 4284.46] And we get a little bit more of her backstory.
[4285.58 → 4287.88] We're told that she was married for seven years
[4287.88 → 4289.26] when her husband died.
[4289.26 → 4292.96] And then in the Bible translation that we have,
[4293.04 → 4296.68] it says that she was a widow until she was 84 years old.
[4297.80 → 4300.34] In fact, though, the way that's written in Greek,
[4300.98 → 4303.62] it probably means not that she was a widow
[4303.62 → 4305.22] until she was 84 years old,
[4305.24 → 4307.86] but that she was a widow for 84 years.
[4309.08 → 4313.44] And so if like most women at that time in Judea,
[4313.44 → 4316.36] she was married at the age of 13 or so,
[4316.72 → 4320.30] her husband died sometime in her 21st year,
[4320.54 → 4323.28] and then 84 years had since passed,
[4323.74 → 4325.42] which means in all likelihood,
[4325.72 → 4327.90] she's probably 105 years old.
[4329.36 → 4332.90] Now, either way, whether it's 105 or 85 or 84,
[4333.46 → 4335.24] she's old.
[4335.24 → 4337.58] And in her old age, what does she do?
[4338.42 → 4340.72] She worships day and night,
[4341.16 → 4344.80] fasting and praying and speaking prophecy.
[4345.86 → 4348.06] In response to her tragedy,
[4348.60 → 4350.62] she focuses her life on God.
[4351.46 → 4354.58] She turned her trauma into a season
[4354.58 → 4356.58] and a lifetime of worship.
[4357.18 → 4359.08] And hear me carefully when I say that, right?
[4359.10 → 4361.26] Because sometimes when we hear the word worship,
[4361.40 → 4363.42] we think only happy and crappy.
[4363.42 → 4364.96] We think songs and dancing.
[4365.40 → 4366.68] Worship includes lament.
[4367.72 → 4369.36] Worship includes crying out.
[4369.80 → 4372.36] Worship includes weeping before the Lord.
[4373.54 → 4375.94] And so she carries her tragedy
[4375.94 → 4378.10] into a life of worship.
[4378.30 → 4381.02] Rather than tragedy pushing her away from God,
[4381.40 → 4384.78] tragedy actually seems to have driven her closer to God.
[4386.06 → 4387.22] And because of that,
[4387.34 → 4391.20] when the great moment of redemption of Israel was upon them,
[4391.20 → 4396.18] she had eyes to see what so many others around her missed.
[4398.72 → 4402.10] And so let's pull these four stories together, right?
[4402.14 → 4406.52] What do Zechariah, Elizabeth, Simeon, and Anna show us
[4406.52 → 4407.80] when we hold them together?
[4408.80 → 4410.90] Their stories, taken as a whole,
[4411.58 → 4414.56] lead us straight into the heart of Advent.
[4414.56 → 4417.82] Their stories, taken as a whole,
[4418.18 → 4421.98] lead us to the idea that God fulfills his promises
[4421.98 → 4423.54] in his perfect time.
[4424.06 → 4426.90] That our waiting is never wasted.
[4427.54 → 4430.98] And so we can have patience in the promises of God.
[4431.76 → 4435.02] That God fulfills his promises in his perfect time.
[4435.30 → 4437.82] Our waiting is never wasted.
[4438.70 → 4441.62] And so we can have patience in the promises of God.
[4441.62 → 4446.70] Each one of these stories is a model for us in this
[4446.70 → 4449.34] and in a distinct and beautiful way.
[4450.54 → 4452.62] When we look at Zechariah and Elizabeth,
[4453.20 → 4456.58] we see two people who are committed to the process,
[4456.94 → 4458.76] who are faithful in the ordinary,
[4459.32 → 4461.26] even as things don't go their way.
[4462.18 → 4462.40] Right?
[4462.42 → 4464.74] There's a consistency in their lives
[4464.74 → 4467.04] because of their faith.
[4467.04 → 4472.54] Archbishop William Temple,
[4473.44 → 4475.32] who was the Archbishop of Canterbury
[4475.32 → 4478.02] in the Church of England during World War II,
[4479.06 → 4482.08] from 1942 to 1944,
[4482.86 → 4484.22] he famously said,
[4484.38 → 4487.38] religion is what you do with your solitude.
[4488.78 → 4492.78] Tim Keller, a bit of a more contemporary preacher
[4492.78 → 4493.96] back in 2021,
[4494.62 → 4496.68] said a similar thing.
[4496.68 → 4499.84] The things we dream about most readily and instinctively
[4499.84 → 4501.86] when nothing else is occupying our thoughts
[4501.86 → 4505.06] reveal what we live for and serve.
[4507.14 → 4510.22] Zechariah and Elizabeth model for us
[4510.22 → 4514.86] just what it means to live for and serve the Lord
[4514.86 → 4518.56] even in the midst of our disappointments.
[4519.52 → 4523.42] Their life together matched their life in the world.
[4523.42 → 4527.76] There's a consistency between what they professed
[4527.76 → 4531.46] and what they professed as their religious commitments
[4531.46 → 4534.96] and the way that caused them to show up
[4534.96 → 4536.90] in the ordinary parts of life
[4536.90 → 4540.22] in the regular moments and years as they passed.
[4542.12 → 4544.32] When I was in my 20s,
[4545.14 → 4546.38] about 20 years ago,
[4546.76 → 4549.72] now there was a big study done in Canada.
[4549.72 → 4553.76] The results of that study were published
[4553.76 → 4556.64] in a study called Hemorrhaging Faith.
[4556.98 → 4558.38] It was published in 2011.
[4559.28 → 4561.24] The big concern at the time
[4561.24 → 4563.72] was about young adults leaving the church.
[4564.58 → 4565.94] At the same time,
[4566.06 → 4567.24] in tandem with this,
[4567.34 → 4568.12] the CRC,
[4568.34 → 4570.40] our denomination that we belong to,
[4570.74 → 4572.46] published some information
[4572.46 → 4575.30] that sort of verified that idea from within.
[4575.88 → 4576.54] It talked about
[4576.54 → 4579.84] that around 60% of people
[4579.84 → 4581.98] who were baptized in the 80s,
[4582.06 → 4583.38] which is when I was born,
[4583.72 → 4586.14] went on to do profession of faith in their 20s.
[4587.82 → 4589.02] Now one of the reasons
[4589.02 → 4591.42] that that was noted in there
[4591.42 → 4594.14] for that hemorrhaging of faith,
[4594.22 → 4595.54] for young adults leaving the church,
[4595.64 → 4596.58] for that disconnect
[4596.58 → 4600.04] was the disconnect
[4600.04 → 4601.82] between professed belief,
[4601.98 → 4603.24] what we said we believed,
[4603.54 → 4606.54] and the lived experience of faith.
[4608.12 → 4609.96] People told us
[4609.96 → 4611.34] when we were this age
[4611.34 → 4612.90] that this mattered
[4612.90 → 4614.76] and you had to believe these things.
[4615.54 → 4617.08] But then as we looked around
[4617.08 → 4618.24] at the lives of the people
[4618.24 → 4619.54] in our churches,
[4620.06 → 4621.94] there wasn't that much difference
[4621.94 → 4623.10] between them
[4623.10 → 4625.12] and the parents of the people
[4625.12 → 4626.18] we played sports with.
[4627.36 → 4629.40] There wasn't this significant impact
[4629.40 → 4631.32] on their lives
[4631.32 → 4632.00] of those people
[4632.00 → 4632.48] who were saying
[4632.48 → 4633.38] this really matters.
[4634.26 → 4635.80] But my non-Christian friends,
[4636.16 → 4636.72] their parents,
[4637.68 → 4638.78] did the same things,
[4638.90 → 4639.74] talked the same way,
[4639.86 → 4640.84] shopped the same way.
[4641.08 → 4642.34] The only difference was
[4642.34 → 4643.56] that hour and 15 minutes
[4643.56 → 4644.32] on Sunday morning
[4644.32 → 4645.48] when we were in church.
[4648.18 → 4650.60] Now, I love the fact that
[4650.60 → 4652.32] fast-forward to today,
[4653.46 → 4653.62] right,
[4653.62 → 4656.60] and there's new data
[4656.60 → 4657.52] out there,
[4658.16 → 4659.80] but young adults
[4659.80 → 4661.62] still want the exact same thing.
[4662.90 → 4664.14] The difference is,
[4664.20 → 4664.98] it seems to me,
[4665.72 → 4666.50] is that you guys
[4666.50 → 4667.84] are taking ownership of it.
[4669.44 → 4670.60] Right, you're not waiting
[4670.60 → 4671.80] for someone to show you,
[4672.52 → 4673.62] you're doing it.
[4674.20 → 4675.24] Right, based on most
[4675.24 → 4675.84] of the metrics
[4675.84 → 4676.74] that we have today,
[4677.00 → 4677.70] the fastest,
[4677.96 → 4678.54] and candidly,
[4678.54 → 4680.02] the only part
[4680.02 → 4680.84] of the Christian church
[4680.84 → 4681.34] in the West
[4681.34 → 4682.26] that is experiencing
[4682.26 → 4683.56] a net growth
[4683.56 → 4685.82] are the 20-somethings
[4685.82 → 4687.98] because they're taking
[4687.98 → 4688.78] ownership of it.
[4689.74 → 4690.66] And they want
[4690.66 → 4691.86] a rigorous faith
[4691.86 → 4694.00] with a rule of life.
[4694.82 → 4696.86] They want transformed living,
[4697.14 → 4698.74] something that might cost you,
[4699.54 → 4701.24] but something that's worth
[4701.24 → 4701.90] the cost.
[4701.90 → 4704.96] And I think that's beautiful
[4704.96 → 4706.18] and awesome.
[4707.88 → 4709.16] Like Zechariah
[4709.16 → 4709.82] and Elizabeth,
[4711.40 → 4712.02] you're waiting
[4712.02 → 4713.68] is not wasted,
[4714.44 → 4715.68] but it shapes
[4715.68 → 4717.14] and is shaped
[4717.14 → 4717.88] by the patience
[4717.88 → 4719.66] that you have
[4719.66 → 4720.50] in the promises
[4720.50 → 4721.84] of God.
[4723.20 → 4724.60] Now, the same is true
[4724.60 → 4726.06] of Simeon.
[4726.32 → 4728.26] Simeon, he waits patiently
[4728.26 → 4729.78] for the Lord's promise.
[4729.78 → 4730.98] He doesn't rush
[4730.98 → 4731.88] in its place
[4731.88 → 4732.84] he worships.
[4733.50 → 4734.24] One person
[4734.24 → 4735.44] that I read this week
[4735.44 → 4736.18] says,
[4736.48 → 4738.08] what captures your hearts
[4738.08 → 4739.86] we see
[4739.86 → 4741.00] with our eyes.
[4742.70 → 4743.22] And so, yes,
[4743.40 → 4744.74] Simeon received
[4744.74 → 4746.12] divine revelation,
[4746.68 → 4747.68] but his heart
[4747.68 → 4748.60] is tuned
[4748.60 → 4749.72] into Scripture.
[4749.90 → 4750.34] His heart
[4750.34 → 4751.20] is tuned
[4751.20 → 4752.64] into God's Word
[4752.64 → 4754.06] which prepares him
[4754.06 → 4755.20] to hear
[4755.20 → 4756.40] God's revelation.
[4756.82 → 4757.54] He can hear
[4757.54 → 4758.78] the voice of God
[4758.78 → 4760.28] because he recognizes
[4760.28 → 4761.24] its timbre
[4761.24 → 4762.46] and its vocal structure.
[4762.70 → 4763.58] It's familiar
[4763.58 → 4764.70] to his heart
[4764.70 → 4766.40] and so he can identify it.
[4768.84 → 4769.64] I remember
[4769.64 → 4770.90] when our kids
[4770.90 → 4771.42] were young,
[4772.36 → 4773.66] every summer
[4773.66 → 4774.52] we would hang out
[4774.52 → 4775.06] at the beach.
[4775.18 → 4775.52] We lived
[4775.52 → 4776.60] in a town
[4776.60 → 4777.64] on Lake Ontario
[4777.64 → 4778.44] where we had
[4778.44 → 4779.46] this excellent beach
[4779.46 → 4780.14] that we would go to.
[4780.26 → 4780.70] It was four minutes
[4780.70 → 4781.44] away from our house.
[4782.32 → 4783.26] And every summer
[4783.26 → 4784.02] in the evenings
[4784.02 → 4784.90] or on Saturdays
[4784.90 → 4785.48] and the afternoons
[4785.48 → 4786.16] or after church
[4786.16 → 4786.76] on Sunday,
[4786.76 → 4788.00] four or five
[4788.00 → 4788.72] other families
[4788.72 → 4789.30] would join us
[4789.30 → 4789.78] and we would go
[4789.78 → 4790.30] to the beach.
[4790.98 → 4791.88] And it would be loud.
[4792.14 → 4792.70] There would be kids
[4792.70 → 4794.06] playing all over the place.
[4794.46 → 4795.16] There would be adults
[4795.16 → 4796.10] talking over here.
[4796.22 → 4797.30] There are six games
[4797.30 → 4797.78] of volleyball
[4797.78 → 4799.02] going on over there.
[4799.08 → 4799.74] There's a radio
[4799.74 → 4801.26] blasting over there.
[4801.34 → 4801.88] There are waves
[4801.88 → 4802.64] crashing in
[4802.64 → 4803.22] on the shore.
[4803.64 → 4804.08] Generally,
[4804.36 → 4805.18] it was a cacophony
[4805.18 → 4805.76] of noises
[4805.76 → 4806.52] and voices.
[4807.24 → 4807.82] But then,
[4808.02 → 4808.82] one kid
[4808.82 → 4810.40] from some 15 feet away
[4810.40 → 4811.32] sitting in a circle
[4811.32 → 4812.42] of other kids
[4812.42 → 4812.90] would say,
[4813.02 → 4813.28] Mom,
[4813.44 → 4814.20] I need you.
[4814.20 → 4816.46] And the right mom
[4816.46 → 4817.48] who was sitting over here
[4817.48 → 4818.40] talking with her friends
[4818.40 → 4818.94] would stop,
[4819.50 → 4820.20] would say,
[4820.24 → 4820.78] I hear you, honey.
[4820.90 → 4821.64] I'll be right there.
[4821.82 → 4822.78] And she came over
[4822.78 → 4824.82] and would deal
[4824.82 → 4825.56] or address
[4825.56 → 4826.86] whatever needed
[4826.86 → 4827.72] to be addressed.
[4827.96 → 4829.42] Through all of that noise
[4829.42 → 4830.46] in the middle
[4830.46 → 4831.78] of 80 other things
[4831.78 → 4833.10] calling for our attention,
[4833.42 → 4835.30] she heard her child's voice.
[4836.00 → 4836.70] She was able
[4836.70 → 4837.46] to pick it out
[4837.46 → 4838.82] from all the other
[4838.82 → 4840.30] voices around her
[4840.30 → 4841.72] competing with it.
[4841.72 → 4844.42] The same is true
[4844.42 → 4845.80] when you know
[4845.80 → 4846.54] God's voice.
[4847.38 → 4848.30] When you love
[4848.30 → 4848.94] God's word,
[4849.68 → 4850.76] you can pick out
[4850.76 → 4851.56] what he is saying
[4851.56 → 4851.98] to you
[4851.98 → 4852.94] from among the many
[4852.94 → 4853.80] competing voices
[4853.80 → 4854.88] in your life.
[4856.24 → 4857.22] Jesus makes
[4857.22 → 4858.08] this same point
[4858.08 → 4858.90] when he describes
[4858.90 → 4860.26] himself as the good shepherd.
[4861.24 → 4862.40] Jesus in John 10
[4862.40 → 4862.68] says,
[4862.84 → 4864.04] I am the good shepherd.
[4864.66 → 4865.20] Then he goes on
[4865.20 → 4865.44] to say,
[4865.50 → 4866.42] the sheep listen
[4866.42 → 4867.98] to his voice.
[4868.18 → 4869.54] He calls his own sheep
[4869.54 → 4870.12] by name
[4870.12 → 4871.14] and leads them out.
[4871.14 → 4873.04] His sheep follow him
[4873.04 → 4874.32] because they know
[4874.32 → 4875.60] his voice.
[4876.92 → 4877.44] They will never
[4877.44 → 4878.30] follow a stranger.
[4879.02 → 4879.44] In fact,
[4879.52 → 4880.34] they will run away
[4880.34 → 4880.88] from him
[4880.88 → 4882.20] because they do not
[4882.20 → 4882.92] recognize
[4882.92 → 4884.78] a stranger's voice.
[4886.08 → 4887.68] The more familiar
[4887.68 → 4888.56] you are
[4888.56 → 4889.82] with God's word,
[4889.96 → 4891.62] the more you will hear
[4891.62 → 4892.60] God's voice
[4892.60 → 4893.48] in your heart.
[4894.48 → 4895.76] And the more you love
[4895.76 → 4896.32] God's,
[4896.68 → 4898.04] the more you love God
[4898.04 → 4899.14] with your whole heart,
[4899.14 → 4900.64] the more you will hear
[4900.64 → 4901.82] his word
[4901.82 → 4903.44] when he speaks to you.
[4904.96 → 4905.44] And look,
[4905.60 → 4905.94] of course,
[4906.10 → 4907.74] don't hear what I'm not saying.
[4908.14 → 4908.30] Right?
[4908.32 → 4909.60] I'm not trying to make this
[4909.60 → 4910.90] formulaic.
[4910.98 → 4912.06] I'm not trying to make this
[4912.06 → 4913.22] like a magic bullet
[4913.22 → 4914.44] or a magic spell
[4914.44 → 4915.28] whereby somehow
[4915.28 → 4916.64] if you do the right things,
[4916.92 → 4917.62] God owes you
[4917.62 → 4918.64] a speaking and a voice.
[4918.64 → 4918.86] Right?
[4918.92 → 4920.08] That kind of manipulation
[4920.08 → 4921.48] is actually a pagan
[4921.48 → 4922.90] approach to God.
[4922.90 → 4924.92] But,
[4925.24 → 4927.04] every relationship
[4927.04 → 4928.84] requires work.
[4929.68 → 4930.62] Every relationship
[4930.62 → 4932.20] requires investment.
[4933.00 → 4933.88] And your relationship
[4933.88 → 4934.32] to God,
[4934.52 → 4934.70] well,
[4934.76 → 4936.04] it's not formulaic.
[4936.08 → 4937.08] It does require
[4937.08 → 4937.76] discipline.
[4938.78 → 4938.92] Right?
[4939.04 → 4940.78] Spiritual discipline.
[4942.16 → 4942.46] Now,
[4942.52 → 4943.10] I hear people
[4943.10 → 4944.20] say this
[4944.20 → 4944.90] all the time.
[4944.98 → 4945.84] Something along
[4945.84 → 4946.46] the lines of,
[4946.72 → 4948.10] I don't read the Bible
[4948.10 → 4949.36] because I just don't
[4949.36 → 4950.32] get anything out of it.
[4950.32 → 4951.32] But,
[4951.32 → 4953.12] if that's true,
[4953.48 → 4954.64] it's also true
[4954.64 → 4955.84] that you don't
[4955.84 → 4956.88] get anything out of it
[4956.88 → 4957.78] because you don't
[4957.78 → 4958.24] read the Bible.
[4959.40 → 4959.70] Right?
[4959.72 → 4960.44] How can you expect
[4960.44 → 4961.36] to hear the voice
[4961.36 → 4961.88] of Jesus
[4961.88 → 4963.28] if you're not familiar
[4963.28 → 4963.94] with the voice
[4963.94 → 4964.42] of Jesus?
[4966.30 → 4966.78] Right?
[4966.80 → 4967.98] I also hear people
[4967.98 → 4969.22] say something like,
[4969.36 → 4970.24] I stopped going
[4970.24 → 4970.72] to church
[4970.72 → 4971.24] because I didn't
[4971.24 → 4972.14] feel anything
[4972.14 → 4973.18] when I was there.
[4974.20 → 4974.60] And so,
[4974.70 → 4975.38] I will ask them.
[4976.16 → 4976.94] And I do it
[4976.94 → 4978.06] more pastorally
[4978.06 → 4978.88] and more sensitively
[4978.88 → 4979.64] than I might right now.
[4979.72 → 4979.82] But,
[4980.32 → 4980.96] I will ask them,
[4981.02 → 4981.64] did it work?
[4983.24 → 4983.46] Right?
[4983.50 → 4984.04] Do you feel
[4984.04 → 4984.74] something now?
[4985.98 → 4986.82] And the answer
[4986.82 → 4987.34] generally
[4987.34 → 4988.90] is the same.
[4989.76 → 4989.98] Right?
[4990.02 → 4990.64] The answer generally
[4990.64 → 4990.98] is, well,
[4991.06 → 4991.30] no,
[4991.44 → 4992.00] not really.
[4992.52 → 4993.42] I just stopped
[4993.42 → 4993.88] trying.
[4995.00 → 4995.24] Right?
[4995.38 → 4996.16] If it's not going
[4996.16 → 4996.94] to make a difference,
[4997.94 → 4998.84] well,
[4998.84 → 4999.52] I do it different.
[5001.60 → 5002.76] Which sounds
[5002.76 → 5003.32] like the same
[5003.32 → 5003.98] old concern
[5003.98 → 5005.68] again and again.
[5005.76 → 5005.86] But,
[5006.32 → 5007.92] here's an idea
[5007.92 → 5009.68] that I think
[5009.68 → 5010.48] is deeply biblical
[5010.48 → 5010.94] but it's
[5010.94 → 5011.94] particular construction.
[5011.94 → 5012.74] I'm borrowing
[5012.74 → 5014.38] from systems theory,
[5014.54 → 5015.50] from change theory,
[5015.66 → 5016.76] from people like
[5016.76 → 5017.48] Brent Brown.
[5017.62 → 5018.14] Some of you are
[5018.14 → 5019.16] familiar with her work.
[5019.16 → 5021.58] your life
[5021.58 → 5023.70] is perfectly designed
[5023.70 → 5024.86] to get you
[5024.86 → 5025.54] the results
[5025.54 → 5026.34] you're currently
[5026.34 → 5026.68] getting.
[5027.62 → 5028.72] Let me say that again.
[5029.26 → 5030.04] Your life
[5030.04 → 5030.74] is perfectly
[5030.74 → 5031.34] designed
[5031.34 → 5032.62] to get the results
[5032.62 → 5033.54] that you are
[5033.54 → 5034.34] currently getting.
[5034.54 → 5035.38] If you want
[5035.38 → 5036.36] different results,
[5037.36 → 5038.34] you need to do
[5038.34 → 5039.22] things differently.
[5039.22 → 5041.88] And this calls
[5041.88 → 5042.64] for deep
[5042.64 → 5043.86] change.
[5044.66 → 5045.98] For life-altering
[5045.98 → 5046.88] change.
[5047.02 → 5047.76] If you made
[5047.76 → 5048.52] a change
[5048.52 → 5049.62] but the results
[5049.62 → 5050.18] are the same,
[5051.14 → 5052.08] the change
[5052.08 → 5052.72] wasn't deep
[5052.72 → 5053.10] enough.
[5054.38 → 5054.80] Right?
[5054.84 → 5055.38] To the person
[5055.38 → 5056.02] who stops
[5056.02 → 5056.94] coming to church
[5056.94 → 5057.76] because they don't
[5057.76 → 5058.76] feel anything
[5058.76 → 5059.92] but then discovers
[5059.92 → 5060.66] that they still
[5060.66 → 5061.84] don't feel anything
[5061.84 → 5062.54] that they thought
[5062.54 → 5063.16] they should,
[5063.66 → 5064.36] the change
[5064.36 → 5065.16] wasn't deep
[5065.16 → 5065.58] enough.
[5066.74 → 5067.20] Perhaps
[5067.20 → 5068.04] it was actually
[5068.04 → 5068.72] a change
[5068.72 → 5069.12] in the wrong
[5069.12 → 5069.64] direction.
[5070.54 → 5070.98] Right?
[5071.02 → 5071.48] To the person
[5071.48 → 5071.94] who stopped
[5071.94 → 5072.66] reading the Bible
[5072.66 → 5073.30] because they don't
[5073.30 → 5073.76] get anything
[5073.76 → 5074.22] out of it,
[5074.78 → 5075.68] you could say
[5075.68 → 5076.16] that you've
[5076.16 → 5077.14] made a change
[5077.14 → 5078.04] but you still
[5078.04 → 5078.60] aren't hearing
[5078.60 → 5079.02] the voice
[5079.02 → 5079.38] of the good
[5079.38 → 5079.68] shepherd.
[5080.34 → 5080.84] The change
[5080.84 → 5081.44] wasn't deep
[5081.44 → 5081.86] enough.
[5082.28 → 5082.68] It wasn't
[5082.68 → 5083.02] the right
[5083.02 → 5083.54] change.
[5083.92 → 5084.36] Instead,
[5085.06 → 5085.28] right,
[5085.34 → 5085.84] the change
[5085.84 → 5086.54] that we need
[5086.54 → 5087.02] is to go
[5087.02 → 5087.94] deeper with
[5087.94 → 5088.20] God,
[5088.26 → 5089.10] to draw closer
[5089.10 → 5090.06] to the shepherd.
[5090.30 → 5091.18] Like Simeon,
[5091.30 → 5091.80] to be filled
[5091.80 → 5092.30] with the Holy
[5092.30 → 5093.58] Spirit so that
[5093.58 → 5094.44] when we pray
[5094.44 → 5095.34] and praise,
[5095.74 → 5096.20] scripture
[5096.20 → 5097.24] comes out
[5097.24 → 5097.68] of us.
[5098.04 → 5099.06] If you had
[5099.06 → 5099.76] eyes to
[5099.76 → 5100.74] see it,
[5100.86 → 5102.46] when Simeon
[5102.46 → 5103.52] gives his
[5103.52 → 5104.84] speech here,
[5105.28 → 5106.06] when he
[5106.06 → 5107.96] speaks over
[5107.96 → 5109.36] the baby
[5109.36 → 5110.04] Jesus,
[5111.22 → 5112.26] the words
[5112.26 → 5112.98] that he says
[5112.98 → 5113.40] there
[5113.40 → 5115.88] sound like
[5115.88 → 5116.32] a scripture
[5116.32 → 5116.90] quote but
[5116.90 → 5117.42] they're not
[5117.42 → 5117.98] a direct
[5117.98 → 5118.52] quote.
[5118.96 → 5119.42] It's a
[5119.42 → 5120.02] paraphrasing
[5120.02 → 5120.40] of about
[5120.40 → 5121.32] three places
[5121.32 → 5122.30] in Isaiah
[5122.30 → 5122.94] that he pulls
[5122.94 → 5123.36] together.
[5123.94 → 5124.44] That's what
[5124.44 → 5124.94] happens when
[5124.94 → 5125.18] you know
[5125.18 → 5125.62] the voice
[5125.62 → 5126.40] of Jesus,
[5126.40 → 5126.76] when you're
[5126.76 → 5127.34] so familiar
[5127.34 → 5127.82] with God's
[5127.82 → 5127.98] word,
[5128.08 → 5128.54] that when
[5128.54 → 5129.26] you pray,
[5129.72 → 5130.36] it comes
[5130.36 → 5131.06] out in
[5131.06 → 5131.38] the voice
[5131.38 → 5131.82] of scripture,
[5131.98 → 5132.54] comes out
[5132.54 → 5132.82] in the
[5132.82 → 5133.84] voice of
[5133.84 → 5134.18] God.
[5135.76 → 5136.52] If your
[5136.52 → 5138.10] desire is
[5138.10 → 5138.64] to really
[5138.64 → 5139.12] encounter
[5139.12 → 5139.64] God,
[5140.24 → 5141.48] don't move
[5141.48 → 5142.44] away from
[5142.44 → 5143.46] the ways
[5143.46 → 5143.76] that he
[5143.76 → 5144.52] has promised
[5144.52 → 5144.98] to be
[5144.98 → 5145.50] present with
[5145.50 → 5146.00] his people
[5146.00 → 5147.48] by his
[5147.48 → 5147.80] word,
[5148.12 → 5148.72] in the
[5148.72 → 5149.26] sacraments,
[5149.60 → 5150.04] through the
[5150.04 → 5151.06] church community
[5151.06 → 5151.76] in worship
[5151.76 → 5152.96] and in life
[5152.96 → 5153.34] together.
[5153.34 → 5154.66] God's
[5154.66 → 5155.04] God's
[5155.04 → 5155.34] love.
[5155.34 → 5156.20] This is where
[5156.20 → 5157.22] Jesus speaks.
[5157.22 → 5157.38] If you're
[5157.38 → 5158.06] longing to
[5158.06 → 5159.08] hear Jesus
[5159.08 → 5159.82] speak,
[5160.22 → 5160.96] go to
[5160.96 → 5161.64] the places
[5161.64 → 5163.16] he speaks,
[5163.70 → 5164.34] not away
[5164.34 → 5164.76] from them.
[5166.24 → 5166.74] In fact,
[5166.82 → 5167.18] this is what
[5167.18 → 5167.50] we see,
[5167.56 → 5167.78] right,
[5167.90 → 5168.42] with Anna.
[5169.98 → 5170.36] Anna,
[5170.48 → 5170.72] in her
[5170.72 → 5171.16] tragedy,
[5171.54 → 5171.96] she chose
[5171.96 → 5172.28] to go
[5172.28 → 5172.68] deeper
[5172.68 → 5173.88] with God.
[5174.54 → 5175.22] At 84
[5175.22 → 5175.84] years old
[5175.84 → 5176.40] or 105
[5176.40 → 5177.50] years old,
[5177.78 → 5178.42] she still
[5178.42 → 5179.00] had something
[5179.00 → 5179.78] to contribute
[5179.78 → 5180.62] to the
[5180.62 → 5181.02] purposes
[5181.02 → 5182.10] of God.
[5183.24 → 5183.52] And I
[5183.52 → 5183.84] didn't want
[5183.84 → 5184.56] to spend
[5184.56 → 5184.94] too much
[5184.94 → 5185.36] time here
[5185.36 → 5185.80] this morning,
[5185.90 → 5186.58] but she's
[5186.58 → 5187.54] 105 years
[5187.54 → 5187.82] old.
[5188.32 → 5188.82] For those
[5188.82 → 5189.04] of you
[5189.04 → 5189.44] who think
[5189.44 → 5189.82] that being
[5189.82 → 5190.26] a senior
[5190.26 → 5190.66] means you
[5190.66 → 5190.96] don't have
[5190.96 → 5191.32] to serve
[5191.32 → 5191.54] in the
[5191.54 → 5191.74] church
[5191.74 → 5192.14] anymore,
[5193.10 → 5193.50] look at
[5193.50 → 5193.68] Anna.
[5194.80 → 5195.38] If you
[5195.38 → 5195.74] think there's
[5195.74 → 5196.26] retirement
[5196.26 → 5196.80] in the
[5196.80 → 5197.08] Christian
[5197.08 → 5197.54] faith,
[5198.18 → 5198.48] look at
[5198.48 → 5198.68] Anna.
[5200.66 → 5200.90] Right?
[5200.98 → 5201.78] We continue
[5201.78 → 5202.66] to serve
[5202.66 → 5203.42] our Lord
[5203.42 → 5203.84] and to be
[5203.84 → 5204.36] used by
[5204.36 → 5204.82] him even
[5204.82 → 5205.82] to 105
[5205.82 → 5207.42] years old.
[5207.64 → 5208.04] Amazing.
[5208.92 → 5209.36] But she
[5209.36 → 5210.36] shows us
[5210.36 → 5211.32] that waiting
[5211.32 → 5212.16] is never
[5212.16 → 5212.66] wasted
[5212.66 → 5213.30] when it's
[5213.30 → 5213.70] offered to
[5213.70 → 5213.94] God.
[5214.84 → 5215.44] She shows
[5215.44 → 5215.78] us that
[5215.78 → 5216.44] her decades
[5216.44 → 5216.98] of sorrow
[5216.98 → 5217.46] did not
[5217.46 → 5218.54] disqualify her,
[5218.80 → 5219.34] they shaped
[5219.34 → 5219.64] her.
[5220.14 → 5220.64] That her
[5220.64 → 5221.22] persistent
[5221.22 → 5222.30] presence in
[5222.30 → 5222.80] the temple
[5222.80 → 5223.38] day after
[5223.38 → 5223.68] day,
[5223.80 → 5224.60] prayer after
[5224.60 → 5224.94] prayer,
[5225.22 → 5225.84] became the
[5225.84 → 5226.74] very means
[5226.74 → 5227.26] by which
[5227.26 → 5227.76] she was
[5227.76 → 5228.40] able to
[5228.40 → 5228.98] recognize
[5228.98 → 5229.76] Jesus the
[5229.76 → 5230.62] moment that
[5230.62 → 5231.08] he appeared.
[5231.40 → 5231.74] And when
[5231.74 → 5232.30] she did,
[5232.40 → 5232.94] all those
[5232.94 → 5233.96] long years
[5233.96 → 5234.62] of patient
[5234.62 → 5235.56] faith turned
[5235.56 → 5236.08] into a
[5236.08 → 5237.10] testimony that
[5237.10 → 5237.86] she used to
[5237.86 → 5238.70] strengthen the
[5238.70 → 5239.14] hope of
[5239.14 → 5239.54] others,
[5239.98 → 5240.74] to strengthen
[5240.74 → 5241.28] the hope
[5241.28 → 5241.80] of all
[5241.80 → 5242.52] those who
[5242.52 → 5243.06] were waiting
[5243.06 → 5243.60] for the
[5243.60 → 5244.48] redemption
[5244.48 → 5245.82] of Jerusalem.
[5247.06 → 5248.18] Anna reminds
[5248.18 → 5249.16] us that
[5249.16 → 5250.28] God fulfills
[5250.28 → 5251.06] his promises
[5251.06 → 5251.92] in his
[5251.92 → 5253.20] perfect time
[5253.20 → 5253.70] and that
[5253.70 → 5254.26] the kind
[5254.26 → 5255.30] of waiting
[5255.30 → 5256.18] we give
[5256.18 → 5257.26] him becomes
[5257.26 → 5258.00] part of
[5258.00 → 5258.54] the way
[5258.54 → 5259.80] he fulfills
[5259.80 → 5260.60] those promises
[5260.60 → 5261.72] in us.
[5263.78 → 5264.16] And so
[5264.16 → 5264.66] specifically,
[5264.80 → 5265.26] this is her
[5265.26 → 5266.16] invitation to
[5266.16 → 5266.38] us,
[5266.38 → 5267.38] that even
[5267.38 → 5268.32] in grief
[5268.32 → 5269.86] we worship.
[5271.10 → 5271.82] Even in
[5271.82 → 5272.42] a lifetime
[5272.42 → 5273.22] of tragedy
[5273.22 → 5274.16] and hardship
[5274.16 → 5275.76] we press
[5275.76 → 5276.22] into whom
[5276.22 → 5276.74] God is
[5276.74 → 5277.30] and what
[5277.30 → 5277.64] God is
[5277.64 → 5277.96] doing.
[5278.86 → 5279.56] A life
[5279.56 → 5279.98] turned
[5279.98 → 5280.58] towards
[5280.58 → 5281.00] God
[5281.00 → 5281.24] through
[5281.24 → 5281.70] sorrow
[5281.70 → 5281.96] and
[5281.96 → 5282.42] questions
[5282.42 → 5282.68] and
[5282.68 → 5283.08] loss
[5283.08 → 5283.60] is
[5283.60 → 5284.14] still
[5284.14 → 5284.60] a
[5284.60 → 5284.86] life
[5284.86 → 5285.18] well
[5285.18 → 5285.62] lived
[5285.62 → 5286.06] because
[5286.06 → 5286.60] God
[5286.60 → 5287.34] is
[5287.34 → 5288.10] good.
[5289.70 → 5289.90] Anna
[5289.90 → 5290.36] shows
[5290.36 → 5290.66] us
[5290.66 → 5290.90] that
[5290.90 → 5291.62] faithfulness
[5291.62 → 5292.00] in the
[5292.00 → 5292.32] dark
[5292.32 → 5293.08] is often
[5293.08 → 5293.92] how God
[5293.92 → 5294.80] prepares us
[5294.80 → 5295.40] to see
[5295.40 → 5296.24] the light.
[5298.16 → 5298.94] And all
[5298.94 → 5299.46] of this
[5299.46 → 5300.70] brings us
[5300.70 → 5300.96] to the
[5300.96 → 5301.32] heart
[5301.32 → 5302.08] then
[5302.08 → 5302.44] of
[5302.44 → 5303.14] Advent's
[5303.14 → 5303.78] hope
[5303.78 → 5304.96] because
[5304.96 → 5305.50] ultimately
[5305.50 → 5306.30] Zechariah
[5306.30 → 5307.06] and Elizabeth
[5307.06 → 5307.74] didn't just
[5307.74 → 5308.52] wait for
[5308.52 → 5309.38] their child.
[5310.04 → 5310.32] Simeon
[5310.32 → 5310.78] didn't just
[5310.78 → 5311.28] wait for
[5311.28 → 5311.92] his moment
[5311.92 → 5312.28] in the
[5312.28 → 5312.54] temple.
[5312.68 → 5312.86] Anna
[5312.86 → 5313.34] didn't just
[5313.34 → 5313.74] wait for
[5313.74 → 5314.20] a flicker
[5314.20 → 5314.78] of comfort
[5314.78 → 5315.40] in her
[5315.40 → 5315.68] grief.
[5315.82 → 5316.22] They were
[5316.22 → 5316.90] all waiting
[5316.90 → 5317.38] for a
[5317.38 → 5317.86] person,
[5318.06 → 5318.76] for God
[5318.76 → 5319.28] to take
[5319.28 → 5319.90] on flesh
[5319.90 → 5320.44] and make
[5320.44 → 5321.06] his dwelling
[5321.06 → 5322.14] among us.
[5322.36 → 5323.14] And that
[5323.14 → 5323.62] is the
[5323.62 → 5324.00] miracle
[5324.00 → 5324.78] of this
[5324.78 → 5325.52] season.
[5325.82 → 5326.04] The
[5326.04 → 5326.40] God
[5326.40 → 5326.60] who
[5326.60 → 5327.06] seemed
[5327.06 → 5327.62] to be
[5327.62 → 5328.20] silent
[5328.20 → 5328.86] had not
[5328.86 → 5329.38] forgotten
[5329.38 → 5329.76] them,
[5330.36 → 5330.88] but his
[5330.88 → 5331.38] timing was
[5331.38 → 5331.84] perfect.
[5332.18 → 5332.30] The
[5332.30 → 5332.60] God
[5332.60 → 5332.84] who
[5332.84 → 5333.56] seemed
[5333.56 → 5334.12] slow
[5334.12 → 5334.48] was
[5334.48 → 5335.10] actually
[5335.10 → 5335.58] right
[5335.58 → 5336.10] on
[5336.10 → 5336.74] time.
[5337.50 → 5337.84] Every
[5337.84 → 5338.20] ache,
[5338.34 → 5338.62] every
[5338.62 → 5339.04] prayer,
[5339.20 → 5339.42] every
[5339.42 → 5339.86] tear,
[5340.18 → 5340.42] every
[5340.42 → 5340.82] year
[5340.82 → 5341.06] of
[5341.06 → 5341.84] obscurity
[5341.84 → 5342.40] was
[5342.40 → 5342.84] leading
[5342.84 → 5343.28] to
[5343.28 → 5343.76] this
[5343.76 → 5344.40] moment,
[5344.54 → 5344.74] this
[5344.74 → 5345.40] proclamation
[5345.40 → 5346.02] of good
[5346.02 → 5346.42] news,
[5346.52 → 5346.98] of great
[5346.98 → 5347.50] joy that
[5347.50 → 5347.74] will be
[5347.74 → 5348.22] for all
[5348.22 → 5348.60] people.
[5348.96 → 5349.34] Today
[5349.34 → 5349.76] in the
[5349.76 → 5350.04] town
[5350.04 → 5351.12] of David
[5351.12 → 5351.92] in Bethlehem
[5351.92 → 5352.22] a
[5352.22 → 5352.58] saviour
[5352.58 → 5353.64] has been
[5353.64 → 5354.24] born.
[5354.46 → 5354.84] This
[5354.84 → 5355.46] is the
[5355.46 → 5355.92] gospel,
[5356.24 → 5356.46] this
[5356.46 → 5356.82] is the
[5356.82 → 5357.30] hope of
[5357.30 → 5357.68] advent,
[5358.02 → 5358.40] that we
[5358.40 → 5358.80] will not
[5358.80 → 5359.68] finally get
[5359.68 → 5360.26] what we
[5360.26 → 5360.78] are waiting
[5360.78 → 5361.20] for,
[5361.30 → 5361.66] but that
[5361.66 → 5362.14] God
[5362.14 → 5362.88] himself
[5362.88 → 5364.38] has
[5364.38 → 5364.70] finally
[5364.70 → 5365.16] come
[5365.16 → 5366.38] into the
[5366.38 → 5366.68] world.
[5367.54 → 5368.38] He is the
[5368.38 → 5369.20] consolation
[5369.20 → 5370.14] that Simeon
[5370.14 → 5370.74] longed for,
[5370.84 → 5371.42] the redemption
[5371.42 → 5372.24] that Anna
[5372.24 → 5372.70] proclaimed,
[5372.86 → 5373.44] the mercy
[5373.44 → 5374.32] that Elizabeth
[5374.32 → 5375.10] rejoiced in,
[5375.16 → 5375.82] the salvation
[5375.82 → 5377.04] that Zechariah
[5377.04 → 5377.76] sang over.
[5378.08 → 5378.76] Everything
[5378.76 → 5379.54] they waited
[5379.54 → 5380.22] for is
[5380.22 → 5380.60] found
[5380.60 → 5381.18] in
[5381.18 → 5381.90] him.
[5383.70 → 5384.04] And this
[5384.04 → 5384.22] is the
[5384.22 → 5384.50] good news
[5384.50 → 5385.00] for us
[5385.00 → 5385.38] too.
[5386.22 → 5386.44] Right?
[5386.50 → 5387.04] Your life
[5387.04 → 5387.58] is not
[5387.58 → 5388.14] overlooked.
[5388.70 → 5388.96] Your
[5388.96 → 5389.36] waiting
[5389.36 → 5389.98] is not
[5389.98 → 5390.44] wasted.
[5390.86 → 5390.98] Your
[5390.98 → 5391.54] story
[5391.54 → 5392.14] is held
[5392.14 → 5392.50] in the
[5392.50 → 5392.92] hands
[5392.92 → 5393.52] of the
[5393.52 → 5393.82] one
[5393.82 → 5394.06] who
[5394.06 → 5394.48] stepped
[5394.48 → 5394.94] into
[5394.94 → 5395.34] our
[5395.34 → 5395.70] world
[5395.70 → 5395.92] and
[5395.92 → 5396.16] took
[5396.16 → 5396.40] on
[5396.40 → 5396.66] our
[5396.66 → 5396.98] flesh,
[5397.36 → 5397.64] bore
[5397.64 → 5398.00] our
[5398.00 → 5398.58] griefs,
[5398.58 → 5399.38] and rose
[5399.38 → 5399.98] to give
[5399.98 → 5400.40] us
[5400.40 → 5401.18] life.
[5401.78 → 5402.18] He
[5402.18 → 5402.64] is
[5402.64 → 5403.28] Emmanuel,
[5403.84 → 5404.16] God
[5404.16 → 5404.52] with
[5404.52 → 5405.02] us,
[5405.20 → 5405.54] God
[5405.54 → 5406.22] with
[5406.22 → 5406.82] you.
[5406.82 → 5408.98] So we
[5408.98 → 5409.46] enter this
[5409.46 → 5409.76] Advent
[5409.76 → 5410.30] season,
[5411.14 → 5413.96] we don't
[5413.96 → 5414.30] enter it
[5414.30 → 5414.60] alone.
[5415.74 → 5416.38] You
[5416.38 → 5416.86] don't
[5416.86 → 5417.20] wait
[5417.20 → 5418.22] alone.
[5419.02 → 5419.56] You
[5419.56 → 5419.72] wait
[5419.72 → 5419.86] with
[5419.86 → 5419.98] the
[5419.98 → 5420.30] church,
[5420.78 → 5420.98] you
[5420.98 → 5421.16] wait
[5421.16 → 5421.38] with
[5421.38 → 5421.70] these
[5421.70 → 5422.38] saints,
[5422.56 → 5422.72] these
[5422.72 → 5423.04] brothers
[5423.04 → 5423.40] and
[5423.40 → 5423.76] sisters
[5423.76 → 5424.02] in
[5424.02 → 5424.14] the
[5424.14 → 5424.34] Lord,
[5424.42 → 5424.54] and
[5424.54 → 5424.84] most
[5424.84 → 5425.02] of
[5425.02 → 5425.20] all,
[5425.54 → 5425.66] you
[5425.66 → 5426.02] wait
[5426.02 → 5426.32] with
[5426.32 → 5426.62] the
[5426.62 → 5426.92] Saviour
[5426.92 → 5427.22] who
[5427.22 → 5427.38] has
[5427.38 → 5427.88] already
[5427.88 → 5428.40] come
[5428.40 → 5428.92] and
[5428.92 → 5429.12] who
[5429.12 → 5429.44] will
[5429.44 → 5429.80] come
[5429.80 → 5430.22] again.
[5431.86 → 5432.26] So may
[5432.26 → 5432.66] you lift
[5432.66 → 5433.20] your eyes
[5433.20 → 5433.44] in
[5433.44 → 5433.74] hope.
[5434.44 → 5434.64] May
[5434.64 → 5434.80] you
[5434.80 → 5435.16] offer
[5435.16 → 5435.44] your
[5435.44 → 5435.82] waiting
[5435.82 → 5436.26] to
[5436.26 → 5436.64] God
[5436.64 → 5437.10] may
[5437.10 → 5437.30] you
[5437.30 → 5437.70] listen
[5437.70 → 5438.00] for
[5438.00 → 5438.32] his
[5438.32 → 5438.74] voice
[5438.74 → 5438.98] in
[5438.98 → 5439.14] the
[5439.14 → 5439.54] noise
[5439.54 → 5439.76] of
[5439.76 → 5439.98] these
[5439.98 → 5440.34] days.
[5441.14 → 5441.52] And
[5441.52 → 5441.64] may
[5441.64 → 5441.80] the
[5441.80 → 5442.14] God
[5442.14 → 5442.34] who
[5442.34 → 5442.74] fulfilled
[5442.74 → 5443.22] every
[5443.22 → 5443.72] promise
[5443.72 → 5443.94] in
[5443.94 → 5444.08] the
[5444.08 → 5444.32] birth
[5444.32 → 5444.50] of
[5444.50 → 5444.70] his
[5444.70 → 5444.98] son
[5444.98 → 5445.68] fill
[5445.68 → 5446.00] you
[5446.00 → 5446.28] with
[5446.28 → 5447.00] certainty
[5447.00 → 5447.66] that
[5447.66 → 5447.84] he
[5447.84 → 5448.06] has
[5448.06 → 5448.34] not
[5448.34 → 5448.84] forgotten
[5448.84 → 5449.18] you,
[5449.70 → 5450.52] that
[5450.52 → 5450.66] he
[5450.66 → 5450.84] is
[5450.84 → 5451.48] nearer
[5451.48 → 5451.68] than
[5451.68 → 5451.96] you
[5451.96 → 5452.34] think,
[5452.42 → 5452.54] that
[5452.54 → 5452.84] he
[5452.84 → 5453.20] is
[5453.20 → 5453.48] not
[5453.48 → 5453.84] done
[5453.84 → 5454.22] with
[5454.22 → 5454.74] your
[5454.74 → 5455.52] story.
[5456.34 → 5456.94] Because
[5456.94 → 5457.34] Christ
[5457.34 → 5457.62] has
[5457.62 → 5458.08] come,
[5458.26 → 5458.60] Christ
[5458.60 → 5459.08] is
[5459.08 → 5459.90] coming,
[5460.78 → 5461.26] and
[5461.26 → 5461.44] in
[5461.44 → 5461.84] him
[5461.84 → 5462.70] none,
[5463.30 → 5463.90] none,
[5464.06 → 5464.60] not one
[5464.60 → 5465.64] moment of
[5465.64 → 5465.84] your
[5465.84 → 5466.26] waiting,
[5466.64 → 5467.16] is
[5467.16 → 5467.54] wasted.
[5468.38 → 5468.68] Amen.
[5469.40 → 5469.82] Let's pray
[5469.82 → 5470.16] together.
[5476.72 → 5477.64] Lord Jesus,
[5477.76 → 5478.16] as we

[5512.84 → 5513.74] how old
[5513.74 → 5514.22] we are,
[5514.30 → 5514.68] whether we
[5514.68 → 5515.10] are in
[5515.10 → 5515.82] grade four
[5515.82 → 5516.62] or 104,

[5526.28 → 5527.10] seriously the
[5527.10 → 5527.58] call and
[5527.58 → 5528.22] the responsibility
[5528.22 → 5529.20] of faith,
[5529.86 → 5530.30] that we
[5530.30 → 5530.70] might take
[5530.70 → 5531.46] ownership for
[5531.46 → 5532.00] the gift
[5532.00 → 5532.74] that you
[5532.74 → 5533.20] have given
[5533.20 → 5533.68] us.
[5533.68 → 5536.68] God,
[5536.76 → 5536.98] as we
[5536.98 → 5537.32] go out
[5537.32 → 5537.76] into this
[5537.76 → 5538.08] world,
[5538.68 → 5539.04] may we
[5539.04 → 5539.74] be a
[5539.74 → 5540.52] people of
[5540.52 → 5542.02] sure hope,

[5552.16 → 5552.62] and our
[5552.62 → 5553.00] words,
[5553.46 → 5553.86] others
[5553.86 → 5554.58] might see
[5554.58 → 5555.72] and know,
[5555.82 → 5556.20] that others
[5556.20 → 5557.28] may wonder,
[5557.72 → 5558.34] what is
[5558.34 → 5559.12] this hope
[5559.12 → 5559.68] that you
[5559.68 → 5560.04] have?
[5561.84 → 5562.50] Give us
[5562.50 → 5563.24] an opportunity
[5563.24 → 5563.90] and give
[5563.90 → 5564.24] us the
[5564.24 → 5564.76] courage to
[5564.76 → 5565.26] take the
[5565.26 → 5565.78] opportunities
[5565.78 → 5566.72] to then
[5566.72 → 5568.00] tell your
[5568.00 → 5568.80] story,
[5569.56 → 5570.40] your story
[5570.40 → 5570.94] of being at
[5570.94 → 5571.42] work in the
[5571.42 → 5571.68] world,
[5571.74 → 5572.22] even now,
[5572.50 → 5572.98] even today,
[5573.12 → 5573.96] even in this
[5573.96 → 5574.70] darkness.
[5575.00 → 5575.38] May your
[5575.38 → 5576.32] light shine
[5576.32 → 5577.36] through us.
[5577.76 → 5578.30] In Jesus
[5578.30 → 5579.02] Christ we
[5579.02 → 5579.30] pray.
[5579.92 → 5580.28] Amen.
[5593.24 → 5612.12] Still, my soul, be
[5612.12 → 5614.50] still, and do not fear.
[5614.50 → 5620.40] Do not fear, the winds of change may rise to me.
[5620.40 → 5633.40] God, is that your Son no longer dread the fires of unexpected storm?
[5633.78 → 5644.40] Love, love, love, and I will trust in you and not be shaken.
[5644.50 → 5658.20] And all of this will be a stopless man within me to rise in you.
[5658.20 → 5668.20] Oh, still, my soul, be still.
[5668.20 → 5675.20] Do not fear, do not fear, the winds of change may rise to me.
[5675.20 → 5686.82] Oh, I will watch in his ways with shield of faith against sensations clean.
[5686.82 → 5698.82] Oh, God, you are my God, and I will trust in you and not be shaken.
[5698.82 → 5700.82] Lord, I will trust in you and not be shaken.
[5700.82 → 5704.82] Lord, I will trust in you and not be shaken.
[5704.82 → 5712.82] The stuff that's here and within me to rise in you alone.
[5712.82 → 5718.82] Oh, God, I will trust in you and not be shaken.
[5718.82 → 5722.82] Help, my soul, be still.
[5722.82 → 5729.82] Do not forsake the truth you learned in the beginning.
[5729.82 → 5737.82] Wake upon the Lord and hope will rise.
[5737.82 → 5739.82] The stars appear when days are coming.
[5739.82 → 5741.82] The stars appear when days are coming.
[5741.82 → 5753.82] God, you are my God, and I will trust in you and not be shaken.
[5753.82 → 5760.82] Lord, I will trust in you and not be shaken.
[5760.82 → 5774.82] Lord, I will trust in you and not be shaken.
[5774.82 → 5777.82] Lord, I will trust in you and not be shaken.
[5777.82 → 5781.82] Lord, I will peace renew.
[5781.82 → 5792.82] The sun has worn within me to rest in you alone.
[5804.82 → 5813.68] before we receive our sending blessing, just a quick encouragement. If you would like to meet
[5813.68 → 5819.34] someone for prayer, there'll be someone up here who'd love to connect with you and pray with you.
[5820.18 → 5825.14] And also, I was reminded of one announcement that I did forget at the beginning. That is,
[5825.14 → 5831.66] next Saturday, we have a worship service at Sun ridge Gardens at 2 p.m. And so,
[5831.66 → 5835.72] even though there's an event happening here, there'll be another event happening
[5835.72 → 5842.38] over at Sun ridge. If you want to sing some Christmas carols and hymns, join us there,
[5843.24 → 5847.72] 2 p.m. Sun ridge, up the hill. You can connect with me if you have any questions about that.
[5848.40 → 5857.56] Receive the blessing of our God. God go before you to lead you. God go behind you to protect you.
[5857.56 → 5864.74] God go beneath you to support you. And God goes beside you to befriend you. Do not be afraid.
[5865.26 → 5873.16] Let the blessing of God come upon you today. Do not be afraid, but go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
[5873.16 → 5874.58] Amen.
[5887.56 → 5901.02] Let the blessing of God.
[5901.02 → 5904.40] Lord.
[5904.40 → 5914.68] Let the blessing of God call you just a reminder here serving God unto you today.
[5914.68 → 5919.68] We hail the earth with hills of His word
[5919.68 → 5924.68] Join the hill of the highest heaven
[5924.68 → 5928.68] Long as the world falls to stone
[5928.68 → 5934.68] From the angels' veil, the music is found
[5934.68 → 5940.68] What a boring world, then hope brings our rise
[5940.68 → 5948.68] The shadows tonight, turn your heart to the call of glory
[5948.68 → 5954.68] Glory to God in the highest
[5954.68 → 5960.68] Peace to men on earth

[5978.68 → 5982.68] When all the time has been spent
[5982.68 → 5988.68] When the Lord returns, His song will repeat
[5988.68 → 5994.68] As heaven completes, promised peace
[5994.68 → 5996.68] That will fill the nations
[5996.68 → 6002.68] Glory to God in the highest
