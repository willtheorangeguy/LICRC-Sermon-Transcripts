[834.00 --> 842.00]  That way,
[842.00 --> 851.96]  this morning. God greets us with these words, grace and peace to you from him who is and who
[851.96 --> 858.08]  was and who is to come and from the seven spirits that are before his throne and from Jesus Christ
[858.08 --> 863.58]  who is the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead and the ruler of the kings of the earth.
[864.34 --> 868.26]  Amen. As God has greeted us this morning, please take a moment to greet those around you.
[872.00 --> 874.00]  Amen.
[902.00 --> 912.74]  Good morning.
[914.00 --> 921.44]  Our call to worship this morning comes from Romans 11 verses 33 to 36.
[921.44 --> 929.68]  Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God. How unsearchable his judgments
[929.68 --> 938.50]  and his paths beyond tracing out. Who has known the mind of the Lord or who has been his counsel?
[939.26 --> 947.52]  Who has ever given to God that God should repay them? For from him and through him and for him
[947.52 --> 952.20]  are all things. To him be the glory forever. Amen.
[952.20 --> 982.18]  Let us sing and honor, glory and power, be unto the ancient of days.
[982.18 --> 991.18]  From every nation, all of creation, bowed for the ancient of days.
[991.18 --> 1000.18]  Every time in heaven and earth shall bear your glory, every each of our children grow.
[1000.18 --> 1001.18]  In worship you will be the kingdom of the ancient of days.
[1001.18 --> 1005.18]  In worship you will be the ancient of days.
[1005.18 --> 1013.18]  And your kingdom shall not pass away, O ancient of days.
[1013.18 --> 1020.18]  Let us sing and honor, glory and power, be unto the ancient of days.
[1020.18 --> 1027.18]  From every nation, all of creation, bowed for the ancient of days.
[1027.18 --> 1033.18]  From every nation, all of creation, bowed for the ancient of days.
[1033.18 --> 1040.18]  Every time in heaven and earth shall declare your glory, every each of our children grow.
[1040.18 --> 1042.18]  Every nation, all of creation, bowed for the ancient of days.
[1042.18 --> 1043.18]  All of creation, bowed for the ancient of days.
[1043.18 --> 1044.18]  In worship you will be the ancient of days.
[1044.18 --> 1049.18]  In worship you will be the exalted, O God.
[1049.18 --> 1055.18]  And your kingdom shall not pass away, O ancient of days.
[1055.18 --> 1059.18]  Sing and honor, glory and power, be unto the ancient of days.
[1059.18 --> 1062.18]  In worship you will be the same, all of creation.
[1062.18 --> 1064.18]  Your kingdom shall bring over all the earth.
[1064.18 --> 1069.18]  Sing to the ancient of days.
[1069.18 --> 1074.18]  For none then compare to your ratchless blood.
[1074.18 --> 1079.18]  Sing unto the ancient of days.
[1079.18 --> 1083.18]  Every time in heaven and earth shall declare your glory,
[1083.18 --> 1086.56]  For the enemy shall bow at your throne.
[1086.94 --> 1091.52]  In worship you will be exalted, O God.
[1092.04 --> 1098.56]  And your kingdom shall now pass away, O ancient of days.
[1106.56 --> 1107.82]  Come on, come on.
[1108.24 --> 1108.70]  Yay!
[1113.18 --> 1141.70]  All my dear, O soul be God.
[1141.70 --> 1152.64]  Faithful through the ages, almighty, most holy Lord.
[1152.94 --> 1156.58]  Glorious, almighty God.
[1156.58 --> 1169.20]  The peace of the field, the birds of the air, are silent to call out your name.
[1169.20 --> 1174.48]  The air has no voice, and I have no choice.
[1174.74 --> 1179.00]  To thank Him, find God unashamed.
[1179.54 --> 1184.12]  Let the rocks be silent for one more day.
[1184.48 --> 1189.26]  Let the whole world sing out when the people sing.
[1189.26 --> 1196.26]  Almighty, most holy God.
[1196.26 --> 1207.26]  Faithful through the ages, almighty, most holy Lord.
[1207.26 --> 1212.26]  Glory is, almighty God.
[1212.26 --> 1213.26]  Lord, who is my god.
[1213.26 --> 1214.26]  Amen.
[1214.26 --> 1215.26]  Amen.
[1215.26 --> 1216.26]  Amen.
[1216.26 --> 1217.26]  Amen.
[1217.26 --> 1218.26]  Amen.
[1218.26 --> 1219.26]  Amen.
[1219.26 --> 1220.26]  Amen.
[1220.26 --> 1221.26]  Amen.
[1221.26 --> 1223.66]  The Lord will cover the earth.
[1224.18 --> 1228.82]  When His Spirit dwells, He's pleased in His wealth,
[1229.12 --> 1231.92]  and the hopeless and longer builder.
[1233.60 --> 1238.26]  He will break the leash of death, it will have no sin.
[1238.66 --> 1243.36]  The prisoners of free join the tents and sing.
[1245.74 --> 1250.92]  Almighty, most holy God,
[1251.26 --> 1256.50]  faithful to the angels, almighty,
[1257.36 --> 1261.26]  most holy Lord,
[1261.70 --> 1266.40]  glorious, almighty God.
[1268.50 --> 1273.68]  Please be seated as we come to a time of confession.
[1273.96 --> 1275.20]  And pray with me, please.
[1281.26 --> 1284.14]  Holy God, You see into our hearts.
[1285.14 --> 1286.12]  You see our sins.
[1287.12 --> 1288.72]  You see our true selves,
[1289.56 --> 1291.26]  our true thoughts and deeds,
[1291.38 --> 1292.98]  which we try to hide from others.
[1293.76 --> 1295.86]  Sins we might even think we can hide from You.
[1297.20 --> 1299.56]  There are sins we commit daily without even thinking,
[1299.76 --> 1302.78]  and are so ingrained in us that we can hardly name them.
[1303.62 --> 1304.46]  Lord, we need You.
[1305.12 --> 1306.22]  We need Your forgiveness,
[1306.62 --> 1309.40]  so we come to You now in a time of quiet,
[1309.56 --> 1311.06]  personal confession of our sins.
[1311.06 --> 1312.50]  Amen.
[1312.50 --> 1313.80]  Amen.
[1313.86 --> 1315.76] aster.
[1315.76 --> 1316.58]  Amen.
[1319.08 --> 1319.86]  Amen.
[1320.30 --> 1320.62]  Amen.
[1320.62 --> 1322.62]  Amen.
[1350.62 --> 1352.62]  Amen.
[1380.62 --> 1385.44]  Without you, I'm all alone.
[1387.20 --> 1393.44]  You're the one that guides my heart.
[1397.06 --> 1399.52]  Lord, I need you.
[1399.68 --> 1403.74]  Oh, I need you.
[1403.74 --> 1410.24]  Every hour I need you.
[1410.62 --> 1416.54]  My one defense, my righteousness.
[1417.54 --> 1422.00]  Oh, God, now I need you.
[1426.26 --> 1432.92]  When sin runs deep, your grace is full.
[1432.92 --> 1436.12]  Your grace is found.
[1436.62 --> 1439.64]  It's where you are.
[1439.64 --> 1441.64]  Where you are.
[1442.94 --> 1445.56]  Lord, I am free.
[1446.56 --> 1453.02]  Holiness is Christ in me.
[1453.02 --> 1454.56]  May God.
[1456.02 --> 1458.56]  Lord, I am free.
[1458.56 --> 1464.48]  Holiness is Christ in me.
[1464.48 --> 1470.40]  Lord, I need you.
[1470.40 --> 1471.40]  Lord, I need you.
[1471.40 --> 1475.40]  Oh, I need you.
[1475.40 --> 1481.40]  Every hour I need you.
[1481.40 --> 1485.32]  My one defense.
[1485.32 --> 1487.32]  My righteousness.
[1487.32 --> 1493.32]  Oh, God, now I need you.
[1493.32 --> 1502.24]  Teach my song to rise to you.
[1502.24 --> 1508.24]  When temptation comes my way.
[1508.24 --> 1510.16]  When I cannot stand.
[1510.16 --> 1511.16]  When I cannot stand.
[1511.16 --> 1513.16]  I'll fall on you.
[1513.16 --> 1519.16]  Jesus, you're my hope and stay.
[1519.16 --> 1522.42]  When I cannot stand.
[1522.42 --> 1524.16]  I'll fall on you.
[1524.16 --> 1530.16]  Jesus, you're my hope and stay.
[1530.16 --> 1533.08]  Lord, I need you.
[1533.08 --> 1535.08]  Oh, I need you.
[1535.08 --> 1537.08]  Oh, I need you.
[1537.08 --> 1541.08]  Oh, I need you.
[1541.08 --> 1547.08]  Every hour I need you.
[1547.08 --> 1550.28]  My one defense.
[1550.28 --> 1550.32]  My one defense.
[1550.32 --> 1553.20]  My righteousness.
[1553.20 --> 1558.28]  Oh, God, now I need you.
[1558.28 --> 1562.06]  Oh, I need you.
[1562.06 --> 1566.20]  Oh, I need you.
[1566.20 --> 1572.32]  Every hour I need you.
[1572.32 --> 1575.52]  My one defense.
[1575.52 --> 1578.52]  My righteousness.
[1578.52 --> 1584.52]  Oh, God, now I need you.
[1584.52 --> 1588.24]  You're my one defense.
[1588.24 --> 1591.32]  My righteousness.
[1591.32 --> 1596.56]  Oh, God, now I need you.
[1596.56 --> 1602.30]  You're my one defense.
[1602.32 --> 1605.52]  You're my one defense.
[1605.52 --> 1607.40]  These are your words of assurance.
[1608.12 --> 1614.94]  People of God, we find hope and assurance of the forgiveness of our sins in 1 John 1,
[1615.34 --> 1616.20]  where we read,
[1616.94 --> 1621.96]  If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
[1622.44 --> 1631.48]  But if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.
[1631.48 --> 1632.48]  Please stand.
[1632.48 --> 1633.48]  Please stand.
[1633.48 --> 1634.48]  Please stand.
[1635.48 --> 1636.48]  Please stand.
[1636.48 --> 1637.48]  Please stand.
[1637.48 --> 1638.48]  Please stand.
[1638.48 --> 1639.48]  Please stand.
[1639.48 --> 1640.48]  Please stand.
[1640.48 --> 1641.48]  Thank you.
[1641.48 --> 1643.48]  Amen.
[1671.48 --> 1683.58]  Heir of salvation, purchase of God, born of His Spirit, washing His blood.
[1683.58 --> 1695.36]  This is my story, this is my song, praising my Savior all that they long.
[1695.36 --> 1707.42]  This is my story, this is my song, praising my Savior all that they long.
[1710.42 --> 1722.00]  Perfect submission, perfect delight, visions of rapture and albers of my sight.
[1722.00 --> 1733.92]  Angels descending, bring from above, echoes of mercy, whispers of love.
[1734.40 --> 1745.50]  This is my story, this is my song, praising my Savior all that they long.
[1745.50 --> 1757.42]  This is my story, this is my song, praising my Savior all that they long.
[1757.42 --> 1766.34]  Perfect submission, always at rest.
[1766.88 --> 1772.24]  High in my Savior, I'm happy and blessed.
[1772.78 --> 1777.42]  Watching and waiting, looking above.
[1777.42 --> 1783.42]  Filled with His goodness, lost in His blood.
[1784.62 --> 1795.42]  This is my story, this is my song, praising my Savior all that they long.
[1795.42 --> 1819.20]  This is my story, this is my song, praising my Savior all that they long.
[1819.20 --> 1831.20]  This is my story, this is my song, praising my Savior all that they long.
[1831.20 --> 1861.18]  This is my song, praising my Savior all that they long.
[1861.18 --> 1863.68]  During those designated offerings, I would like to point out to you
[1863.68 --> 1865.60]  the email that was sent around this week,
[1866.22 --> 1869.64]  concerning what's befallen Jody and Ariel Gonzales,
[1869.64 --> 1871.58]  our missionary village family in Mexico.
[1871.62 --> 1873.36]  As you've probably read,
[1873.36 --> 1876.96]  they had bought a property that they were going to move their home on to.
[1877.14 --> 1881.28]  Before they could move, a severe rain storm brought down
[1881.28 --> 1885.42]  a retaining wall and filled their property with debris.
[1885.42 --> 1891.12]  debris. So Jody and Ariel are very thankful that they had not yet moved to that property
[1891.12 --> 1896.88]  and they're also thankful that the landlord that they have is currently willing to have
[1896.88 --> 1901.70]  them stay where they are. But of course this brings huge costs to Jody and Ariel. First
[1901.70 --> 1906.60]  of all now they have to pay two rents so to speak. One for their current property that
[1906.60 --> 1911.04]  they're still on and also then payments for the property that they bought. And then of
[1911.04 --> 1916.98]  course there's excavating fees, there's labor costs, there's building costs. So they
[1916.98 --> 1921.12]  figure that all of that to remediate everything and resettle is going to cost
[1921.12 --> 1927.12]  them about $30,000. And of course that's quite a bit of money for them. So if you
[1927.12 --> 1931.86]  could help out in any way that'd be great. The email that we sent to the
[1931.86 --> 1937.38]  membership has a way of sending via e-transfer. Make sure that when you send
[1937.38 --> 1940.92]  e-transfer that you actually send the money to the church and then on the
[1940.92 --> 1946.80]  memo put C10. C10 is the giving agency for Jody and Ariel. You can also put money
[1946.80 --> 1952.08]  in the offering bag. You can write a check and then make that check out to
[1952.08 --> 1957.58]  the church and then the memo line write down for C10. And of course there's
[1957.58 --> 1961.74]  always cash that you can give. Put that in an envelope. There's envelopes in the
[1961.74 --> 1967.14]  chairs in front of you and mark that C10 for Jody and Ariel. Our designated
[1967.14 --> 1972.02]  offerings today are for the budget and then also our special offering is for
[1972.02 --> 1977.04]  Gateway of Hope. So for the budget if you wish to give to that do the same thing as
[1977.04 --> 1982.56]  for Jody and Ariel. Write a check. Make sure it's written to Langley Emanuel and then
[1982.56 --> 1987.42]  mark it budget. Or if you use cash and then use the envelope setter and the chairs
[1987.42 --> 1993.80]  in front of you and mark it for the budget. Gateway of Hope is a community
[1993.80 --> 2000.56]  center run by the Salvation of Army here in Langley off the bypass and it is a
[2000.56 --> 2005.54]  community center for the vulnerable sector of our population here in Langley.
[2005.54 --> 2012.42]  Gateway of Hope provides shelter, food, counseling and most of all they provide hope.
[2012.42 --> 2018.72]  Okay and they do this all in the name of Jesus. So do give generously today even as
[2018.72 --> 2024.20]  we have all been generously blessed this past week. Thank you.

[2100.36 --> 2103.36]  a heart with problems
[2103.36 --> 2106.68]  such thunders raise
[2106.68 --> 2109.66]  the God of angels
[2109.66 --> 2112.38]  sent out from glory
[2112.38 --> 2114.98]  to bear my sin
[2114.98 --> 2118.18]  and bear my shame
[2118.18 --> 2121.10]  the cross has folded
[2121.10 --> 2124.10]  I am forgiven
[2124.10 --> 2126.98]  the King of kings
[2126.98 --> 2130.32]  calls me his home
[2130.32 --> 2133.16]  beautiful Savior
[2133.16 --> 2136.16]  I'm yours forever
[2136.16 --> 2139.04]  Jesus Christ
[2139.04 --> 2142.04]  my living hope
[2142.04 --> 2144.92]  hallelujah
[2144.92 --> 2145.92]  hallelujah
[2145.92 --> 2149.18]  praise the one who set me free
[2149.18 --> 2151.10]  hallelujah
[2151.10 --> 2155.10]  death has lost its grip on me
[2155.10 --> 2158.18]  you have broken every chain
[2158.18 --> 2161.12]  and salvation is not made
[2161.12 --> 2162.00]  Jesus Christ
[2162.00 --> 2166.00]  my living hope
[2166.00 --> 2168.00]  hallelujah
[2168.00 --> 2172.92]  praise the one who set me free
[2172.92 --> 2174.00]  hallelujah
[2174.00 --> 2178.80]  death has lost its grip on me
[2178.80 --> 2181.76]  you have broken every chain
[2181.76 --> 2184.68]  and salvation in your name
[2184.68 --> 2186.56]  Jesus Christ
[2186.56 --> 2189.56]  my living hope
[2189.56 --> 2190.56]  Jesus Christ
[2190.56 --> 2191.56]  my living hope
[2191.56 --> 2195.56]  then hear the morning
[2195.56 --> 2198.56]  that sealed the promise
[2198.56 --> 2201.56]  your very body
[2201.56 --> 2204.90]  began to breathe
[2204.90 --> 2207.78]  out of the silence
[2207.78 --> 2209.78]  the roaring lion
[2209.78 --> 2213.16]  declare the grave
[2213.16 --> 2216.78]  has no blame on me
[2216.78 --> 2219.78]  and with the morning
[2219.78 --> 2222.88]  that sealed the promise
[2222.88 --> 2225.54]  your very body
[2225.54 --> 2227.96]  began to breathe
[2227.96 --> 2229.84]  hallelujah
[2229.84 --> 2231.84]  death has lost its grip on me
[2231.84 --> 2232.84]  the Lord
[2232.84 --> 2233.84]  the roaring lion
[2233.84 --> 2236.92]  declare the grave
[2236.92 --> 2239.84]  has no blame on me
[2239.84 --> 2241.84]  Jesus
[2241.84 --> 2242.84]  yours
[2242.84 --> 2244.84]  is the victory
[2244.84 --> 2247.84]  hallelujah
[2247.84 --> 2249.84]  hallelujah
[2249.84 --> 2255.56]  praise the one who set me free
[2255.82 --> 2256.30]  hallelujah
[2256.30 --> 2257.68]  hallelujah
[2257.68 --> 2259.04]  death
[2259.04 --> 2261.34]  has lost its grip on me
[2261.34 --> 2264.30]  you have broken every chain
[2264.30 --> 2267.24]  and salvation in your name
[2267.24 --> 2267.76]  Jesus Christ
[2270.36 --> 2272.52]  my living hope
[2272.52 --> 2273.44]  hallelujah
[2273.44 --> 2278.72]  praise the one who set me free
[2278.72 --> 2280.48]  hallelujah
[2280.48 --> 2284.58]  death has lost its grip on me
[2284.58 --> 2287.46]  You have broken every chain
[2287.46 --> 2290.34]  There's salvation in your name
[2290.34 --> 2295.80]  Jesus Christ, my living hope
[2295.80 --> 2301.68]  Jesus Christ, my living hope
[2301.68 --> 2307.54]  Oh God, you are my living hope
[2314.58 --> 2320.74]  Good morning, everybody.
[2320.74 --> 2323.84]  Can I have the kids all the way from preschool
[2323.84 --> 2326.82]  all the way up to grade four come up to the front this morning?
[2334.50 --> 2335.60]  Just have a seat.
[2335.60 --> 2344.56]  Good morning.
[2345.12 --> 2348.40]  I would like you guys to put your thinking caps on this morning
[2348.40 --> 2352.00]  and think, if I gave you a big box
[2352.00 --> 2353.90]  that looked like a treasure chest
[2353.90 --> 2357.92]  what kind of things would you put inside of it?
[2359.80 --> 2361.22]  What kind of things?
[2361.58 --> 2364.22]  Just shout out some ideas, one at a time.
[2364.22 --> 2365.62]  Pardon me?
[2366.62 --> 2367.26]  Jewelry?
[2367.62 --> 2368.68]  Maybe a frog.
[2369.34 --> 2369.86]  Maybe.
[2369.96 --> 2370.98]  A frog, maybe.
[2372.10 --> 2373.16]  An orange?
[2374.08 --> 2374.62]  A tablet.
[2375.00 --> 2376.08]  Maybe a tablet?
[2379.14 --> 2380.18]  A TV.
[2380.46 --> 2381.20]  A TV?
[2382.48 --> 2386.12]  All these things that we're putting in this treasure chest
[2386.12 --> 2386.90]  Yes, Elizabeth.
[2388.08 --> 2388.64]  Gems.
[2388.88 --> 2391.58]  Yeah, all these things that we're putting in this treasure chest
[2391.58 --> 2394.22]  Do we absolutely need it?
[2395.50 --> 2395.90]  No?
[2396.10 --> 2397.26]  Does it make us happy?
[2398.82 --> 2399.76]  It can't?
[2399.84 --> 2400.08]  What?
[2401.74 --> 2402.14]  Yeah.
[2402.58 --> 2402.74]  Yeah.
[2405.12 --> 2405.98]  Could we...
[2405.98 --> 2406.80]  Pardon me?
[2407.54 --> 2408.72]  Yeah, you can put money in there.
[2408.78 --> 2408.92]  Okay.
[2409.54 --> 2411.28]  Could we live without it?
[2412.68 --> 2414.32]  All the things that we're putting in?
[2414.32 --> 2416.62]  Some of the stuff we can live without
[2416.62 --> 2420.86]  Some we can't, depending if we put our Bible in there
[2420.86 --> 2424.94]  If we put other things in there
[2424.94 --> 2426.32]  Maybe food
[2426.32 --> 2428.12]  Some things we can't live without
[2428.12 --> 2429.66]  But what we're going to learn today
[2429.66 --> 2431.60]  And I'm sure in congregation today
[2431.60 --> 2432.34]  We're going to learn
[2432.34 --> 2434.52]  That possessions
[2434.52 --> 2437.06]  Or items like a TV
[2437.06 --> 2438.42]  Chocolate
[2438.42 --> 2439.86]  Jewelry
[2439.86 --> 2441.60]  That we can live without
[2441.60 --> 2443.24]  But to make us happy
[2443.24 --> 2446.32]  Is we need to have Jesus in our hearts
[2446.32 --> 2447.44]  Right?
[2447.92 --> 2448.40]  Okay.
[2448.52 --> 2449.78]  Everybody stand up
[2449.78 --> 2453.62]  And we're going to face the congregation
[2453.62 --> 2456.20]  And ready?
[2456.52 --> 2457.30]  One, two, three
[2457.30 --> 2458.04]  The Lord
[2458.04 --> 2459.20]  We'll be with you
[2459.20 --> 2461.12]  We'll be with you
[2461.12 --> 2461.30]  We'll be with you
[2461.30 --> 2462.76]  We'll be with you
[2462.76 --> 2463.26]  Hi Mama
[2463.26 --> 2493.24]  Thank you.
[2493.26 --> 2523.24]  Thank you.
[2523.26 --> 2525.26]  Thank you.
[2553.26 --> 2555.26]  Thank you.
[2555.26 --> 2562.42]  We have allowed the world to affect our lives by its concerns, its fears, and its falsehood.
[2563.18 --> 2565.76]  Even our own hearts deceive us.
[2566.92 --> 2567.78]  Forgive us, Lord.
[2568.70 --> 2572.20]  Create in us clean hearts and a steadfast spirit.
[2573.54 --> 2578.36]  Renew our minds so that we can be effective ambassadors for Jesus Christ.
[2578.36 --> 2585.12]  Lord, we lift up to you members of our church family who are living with difficulties.
[2586.16 --> 2590.60]  We pray for the elderly and those with health and mobility concerns.
[2591.60 --> 2595.20]  Be with Clary's sister as she heals from a recent accident.
[2595.20 --> 2603.56]  Give her patience and hope and enable her to experience your hand at work in this situation.
[2603.56 --> 2612.28]  We pray for all the soon-to-be and all the new moms in our midst.
[2613.08 --> 2617.76]  We pray for good health and rest as they care for these little ones.
[2617.76 --> 2624.34]  Thank you, Lord, for families who are providing your love to those children that need love and support.
[2624.34 --> 2626.34]  We pray for them.
[2626.34 --> 2633.30]  We pray for Millie, infant daughter of James and Shana, as she undergoes surgery by your will this week.
[2634.26 --> 2640.20]  Calm their hearts and bless the good work of the doctors and nurses at Children's Hospital.
[2640.20 --> 2643.64]  We pray for those who are living with children and children, as she has been healing for their children.
[2643.64 --> 2647.42]  We pray for those persecuted for your name.
[2648.16 --> 2651.18]  We think of those in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa.
[2652.20 --> 2654.96]  Help them not to lose hope, but stand firm.
[2655.84 --> 2658.82]  Give them courage and zeal to stand up for your name.
[2660.36 --> 2664.26]  We give thanks for the ordination of Pastor Kevin this past week.
[2665.34 --> 2669.82]  Bless Pastor Kevin, Nikki, and their girls as they minister among us.
[2671.06 --> 2676.00]  And now, as Kevin brings your word to us, may we receive it in our hearts and our minds.
[2676.76 --> 2680.98]  And by your Spirit, live it out in our lives and by our actions.
[2681.98 --> 2683.16]  May your name be praised.
[2683.72 --> 2685.24]  We ask this in Jesus' name.
[2685.84 --> 2686.12]  Amen.
[2700.20 --> 2701.20]  Amen.
[2701.20 --> 2702.20]  Amen.
[2706.84 --> 2707.20]  Amen.
[2707.20 --> 2707.66]  Amen.
[2707.66 --> 2707.86]  Amen.
[2707.86 --> 2708.30]  Amen.
[2708.30 --> 2716.60]  I'm sure many of you have experienced the joy of playing Monopoly with family and friends, right?
[2717.58 --> 2721.20]  It always, the giggles in the room, you already know where we're going with this,
[2721.24 --> 2723.26]  because it always starts out innocent enough.
[2723.26 --> 2725.50]  We all agree we're going to have fun.
[2725.72 --> 2729.94]  We're going to count our pastel-colored money, and we're going to pretend that everyone's
[2729.94 --> 2730.94]  going to play fair.
[2731.42 --> 2737.56]  But give it 20 minutes, and suddenly Uncle Tim has three hotels locked up on boardwalk.
[2738.00 --> 2741.82]  Your sister, who barely knows the rules, owns all of the railroads.
[2742.24 --> 2747.82]  And you're stuck mortgaging Baltic Avenue just to survive another turn.
[2747.82 --> 2754.00]  And then the moment comes when someone realizes there's no catching up.
[2755.06 --> 2756.94]  You feel the injustice in the air.
[2757.10 --> 2761.34]  Someone's thimble isn't going to make it around the board, pass, go one more time.
[2761.46 --> 2764.24]  And they're just bitterly counting the pennies.
[2764.30 --> 2765.54]  And sure enough, it happens.
[2766.60 --> 2768.40]  A hand slams down on the board.
[2768.78 --> 2771.38]  The little greenhouses go flying everywhere.
[2772.22 --> 2775.68]  And the room, or the game story, doesn't end because someone won.
[2775.68 --> 2778.06]  It ends because someone snapped.
[2779.64 --> 2786.18]  In a game where the pursuit of wealth is the goal, I've heard many a Monopoly story ending
[2786.18 --> 2792.16]  with a board on the ground and a bunch of losers just sitting around a peace-filled room,
[2792.66 --> 2794.30]  wasting three hours of their life.
[2795.64 --> 2798.74]  Well, the pursuit of wealth today is the focus of the teachers.
[2798.90 --> 2801.72]  We continue our sermon series through Ecclesiastes.
[2801.72 --> 2806.76]  I'm going to invite you all to open up your Bibles, or if you've got a Bible app on your phone,
[2807.76 --> 2809.00]  feel free to open that as well.
[2809.30 --> 2813.90]  And keep that text open today as we kind of reference it throughout this message.
[2814.30 --> 2819.52]  We're going to look at Ecclesiastes 5, verses 10 to 20.
[2819.60 --> 2821.82]  So Ecclesiastes 5, verses 10 to 20.
[2822.46 --> 2823.52]  It says this.
[2823.52 --> 2827.80]  Whoever loves money never has enough.
[2828.76 --> 2832.40]  Whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with their income.
[2833.32 --> 2835.44]  This, too, is meaningless.
[2836.46 --> 2839.60]  As goods increase, so do those who consume them.
[2839.74 --> 2844.40]  And what benefit are they to the owners except to feast their eyes on them?
[2844.96 --> 2848.50]  The sleep of a laborer is sweet, whether they eat little or much.
[2848.50 --> 2852.56]  But as for the rich, their abundance permits them no sleep.
[2853.52 --> 2858.50]  I have seen grievous evil under the sun, wealth hoarded to the harm of its owners,
[2858.62 --> 2861.08]  or wealth lost through some misfortune,
[2861.64 --> 2864.72]  so that when they have children, there is nothing left for them to inherit.
[2865.66 --> 2867.96]  Everyone comes naked from their mother's womb,
[2868.04 --> 2871.22]  and everyone comes, as everyone comes, so they depart.
[2872.08 --> 2877.80]  They take nothing from their toil that they can carry in their hands.
[2878.16 --> 2880.02]  This, too, is a grievous evil.
[2880.14 --> 2882.00]  As everyone comes, so they depart.
[2882.00 --> 2884.72]  And what do they gain since they toil for the wind?
[2885.68 --> 2891.46]  All their days they eat in darkness with great frustration, affliction, and anger.
[2892.82 --> 2895.06]  This is what I have observed to be good.
[2895.96 --> 2899.66]  That it is appropriate for a person to eat, to drink, and to find satisfaction
[2899.66 --> 2906.06]  in their toilsome labor under the sun during the few days of life God has given them.
[2906.52 --> 2907.62]  For this is their lot.
[2907.62 --> 2913.34]  Moreover, when God gives someone wealth and possessions and the ability to enjoy them,
[2913.58 --> 2917.96]  to accept their lot and be happy in their toil, this is a gift of God.
[2918.96 --> 2925.58]  They seldom reflect on the days of their life because God keeps them occupied with gladness of heart.
[2926.14 --> 2927.38]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2927.38 --> 2932.06]  The pursuit of money.
[2932.06 --> 2932.10]  The pursuit of money.
[2933.10 --> 2936.00]  The accumulation of things.
[2936.84 --> 2938.74]  And the desire for legacy.
[2938.74 --> 2946.58]  We're going to look at three false gospels that the teacher highlights in this passage.
[2946.58 --> 2951.46]  Three false gospels that our current world still pushes today.
[2952.20 --> 2959.88]  And we're going to look at how these three false gospels actually hold us back from experiencing true joy.
[2959.88 --> 2963.46]  And so without further ado, false gospel number one.
[2963.86 --> 2965.50]  The pursuit of money.
[2966.24 --> 2970.04]  The pursuit of money will meet your needs.
[2971.40 --> 2978.08]  See, the pursuit of money is a false gospel because it's this ever-present whisper in your ear
[2978.08 --> 2985.98]  that just a little bit more will finally bring the security or the happiness or the comfort or the peace
[2985.98 --> 2988.86]  or the satisfaction that we're all craving.
[2988.86 --> 2995.68]  Just a little bit more money and I can finally afford to buy a more reliable car
[2995.68 --> 2997.86]  and then I don't have to deal with that rusty muffler anymore.
[2998.24 --> 3003.78]  Just a little bit more and I can afford to go on a vacation where I can finally relax.
[3004.44 --> 3009.68]  Just a little bit more money and I can pay off that student loan and then I can live a little easier.
[3010.46 --> 3015.84]  Just a little bit more money and I can finally convince the bank to give me enough money for a mortgage
[3015.84 --> 3018.50]  so I can enter into this crazy house market.
[3018.86 --> 3025.16]  Just a little bit more money and I can finally pay off that mortgage and finally live a little more freely.
[3026.40 --> 3031.62]  Just a little bit more money and I'll finally be confident enough in my retirement savings
[3031.62 --> 3034.86]  so that I can live out the rest of my days and maybe help out my kids.
[3034.86 --> 3035.86]  Just a little bit more.
[3035.86 --> 3038.02]  Just a little bit more.
[3038.02 --> 3040.08]  Just a little bit more.
[3040.08 --> 3048.90]  The idea that just a little bit more money would help still permeates all of our lives I think.
[3049.64 --> 3051.28]  We hear it from advertisement.
[3051.52 --> 3054.52]  Just make a little bit more money and you'll be a little bit more secure.
[3054.82 --> 3055.96]  We see it in our systems.
[3056.36 --> 3058.62]  It shows up in the long hours of our work weeks.
[3058.70 --> 3060.06]  The overtime that we work.
[3060.54 --> 3062.92]  The constant hustle to get things done.
[3062.92 --> 3069.88]  And we see it even how we define our success by our total incomes instead of our characters.
[3071.68 --> 3073.94]  And I know for me personally we feel it too.
[3074.04 --> 3075.50]  I feel it in my heart.
[3076.60 --> 3077.72]  I've said this before.
[3077.82 --> 3079.06]  Maybe I've said this to some of you.
[3079.34 --> 3081.88]  I don't actually desire to be filthy rich.
[3082.22 --> 3085.08]  Being filthy rich doesn't sound that appealing to me.
[3085.16 --> 3086.16]  It sounds like too much pressure.
[3086.16 --> 3090.30]  But I have said just a little bit more an awful lot in my life.
[3090.94 --> 3096.42]  If I had just a little bit more I could pay off my mortgage and that would be very handy.
[3096.52 --> 3098.44]  Then I could live out the rest of my days secure.
[3101.18 --> 3103.42]  That's crossed my mind more than I'd like to admit.
[3105.10 --> 3110.44]  Actually when I was going through this ordination process the first question the CRC candidacy committee
[3110.44 --> 3112.46]  asked me in my interview for the denomination.
[3112.80 --> 3114.60]  The first question they asked me was this.
[3114.60 --> 3118.26]  They said are you doing this for the pay raise and the pension?
[3120.16 --> 3122.50]  And at first that actually unsettled me a little bit.
[3122.92 --> 3125.62]  I felt like they didn't have the right to answer.
[3125.70 --> 3126.30]  Like who were they?
[3126.36 --> 3127.28]  They didn't know who I was.
[3127.34 --> 3128.68]  I didn't know who this person was.
[3129.86 --> 3132.02]  If it were true I would have gone this route a lot earlier.
[3132.16 --> 3132.88]  I'll tell you that.
[3135.64 --> 3137.94]  And yet everyone wants just a little bit more.
[3138.02 --> 3141.48]  And for me I actually needed to be asked and answer that question.
[3142.94 --> 3144.56]  Am I pursuing this?
[3144.60 --> 3146.40]  Am I pursuing the pay raise?
[3146.64 --> 3148.82]  Am I pursuing just a little bit more?
[3149.46 --> 3150.84]  Am I pursuing wealth?
[3153.32 --> 3154.98]  Ecclesiastes 5.10 says,
[3155.98 --> 3158.94]  Whoever loves money never has enough.
[3160.70 --> 3164.74]  See the teacher points out that the pursuit of money it never satisfies.
[3165.06 --> 3168.62]  The love of money leads to only more hunger for it.
[3168.62 --> 3172.82]  That's why the richest people in our world, they still push for more.
[3173.20 --> 3174.46]  They still want to make more.
[3174.52 --> 3177.66]  They still want to have more because you can always have a little bit more.
[3177.66 --> 3183.96]  And when people believe that the pursuit of money is going to meet all of their needs,
[3184.04 --> 3188.16]  they're chaining themselves to the idea that money actually solves the problems.
[3188.16 --> 3194.22]  But all it actually leads to is this endless cycle of greed and want.
[3194.22 --> 3201.60]  Studies have actually shown this, that after one reaches a certain income level, your happiness plateaus.
[3201.92 --> 3206.10]  Now there's a little bit of nuance to these studies and at the risk of oversimplifying it to make a point.
[3206.10 --> 3212.42]  Once you make enough money to eat food every day, to meet your basic needs, and to sleep without fear at night,
[3213.38 --> 3216.28]  added income actually doesn't increase your happiness anymore.
[3217.00 --> 3220.38]  It doesn't increase your joy, just your desire for more money.
[3221.38 --> 3224.28]  Again, just a little bit more, just a little bit more.
[3225.20 --> 3226.56]  And Paul warns us of this too.
[3226.78 --> 3228.68]  In 1 Timothy 6.10 it says this,
[3228.68 --> 3232.48]  For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.
[3232.48 --> 3238.48]  Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.
[3240.68 --> 3244.84]  Notice it's not money itself that's evil, it's the love of money.
[3245.92 --> 3249.56]  The constant pursuit of just a little bit more.
[3250.62 --> 3251.98]  As if that will fix our problems.
[3252.46 --> 3254.72]  That's the false gospel that grips us.
[3255.02 --> 3257.74]  That binds us up instead of freeing us to truly live.
[3259.70 --> 3262.46]  The second false gospel that our text highlights is this,
[3262.48 --> 3265.62]  The accumulation of things will bring you joy.
[3266.90 --> 3271.60]  The accumulation of things promises comfort and control.
[3272.46 --> 3276.58]  Now this false gospel tells us that owning more will make life easier or happier.
[3277.62 --> 3281.38]  In Western culture this shows up in constant upgrades, I think.
[3282.56 --> 3283.48]  In constant upgrades.
[3283.56 --> 3287.44]  We have newer phones, bigger houses, better cars, fuller closets.
[3287.44 --> 3292.42]  But every purchase simply feeds the hunger for the next one.
[3292.80 --> 3294.40]  We desire stuff, more stuff.
[3294.84 --> 3299.20]  And look, I know this is a message we've probably heard over and over again.
[3299.34 --> 3302.22]  But it bears repeating because this isn't changing.
[3303.42 --> 3309.24]  It's so prevalent in our world that now we don't just want more stuff ourselves.
[3309.24 --> 3317.06]  Our entertainment has even turned into watching people accumulate stuff.
[3317.06 --> 3325.30]  There are TikTokers out there making boatloads of money simply unboxing content.
[3326.26 --> 3330.62]  Literally opening boxes and being watched.
[3331.02 --> 3335.60]  There's YouTubers making a living by showing all the stuff they bought.
[3335.60 --> 3345.42]  There are hundreds of thousands of hours, maybe millions of hours, online of people videoing themselves opening boxes,
[3345.90 --> 3350.86]  revealing the world of the new toys, the new gifts, the new gadgets, the new products that they've watched.
[3351.12 --> 3353.16]  And people simply watch them accumulate.
[3354.16 --> 3358.56]  So people can live vicariously through the experience of obtaining more product.
[3358.56 --> 3364.56]  I found several videos online this week of people opening entire Amazon flats of spa products.
[3365.70 --> 3370.88]  I found a two-hour video of someone opening up thousands of unopened Squishmallows.
[3371.18 --> 3373.38]  And if you don't know what Squishmallows are, that's fine.
[3373.64 --> 3374.52]  You don't need to know.
[3374.74 --> 3375.82]  They're basically stuffies.
[3376.34 --> 3382.46]  There is a YouTube channel out there that's dedicated to opening boxes of the newest tech.
[3382.52 --> 3386.98]  And this channel has released, on its own, 2,400 videos.
[3386.98 --> 3390.56]  And that's just the stuff I found in 90 seconds.
[3391.18 --> 3392.40]  I've ruined my algorithm.
[3394.64 --> 3399.20]  And if you're wondering who's watching this, so many people.
[3401.16 --> 3407.44]  Unbox Therapy, that's the YouTube channel I just mentioned, it has over 24.8 million subscribers.
[3409.20 --> 3414.46]  iJustine, who opens up boxes of lifestyle gadgets and more, she has over 7 million followers on her own.
[3414.46 --> 3417.12]  And Ryan's World, which is actually stars a kid.
[3417.64 --> 3419.68]  Now, it does some other things on this channel as well.
[3419.90 --> 3423.20]  But he opens up a lot of toys and materials.
[3423.90 --> 3426.52]  He has over 35 million followers.
[3428.10 --> 3430.82]  And that's just three of thousands.
[3432.36 --> 3433.70]  We want things.
[3435.76 --> 3436.94]  We want things.
[3437.30 --> 3439.92]  If we can't get them, we want to see them.
[3440.04 --> 3442.58]  And we want to dream about what it would be like having them.
[3442.58 --> 3447.94]  This accumulation of things is thought to bring us joy.
[3448.34 --> 3452.52]  And maybe you're sitting here and you're hearing all of that and you're like, wow, that is bonkers.
[3453.36 --> 3455.44]  Who's wasting their time watching videos like this?
[3455.48 --> 3456.52]  This doesn't apply to me.
[3458.52 --> 3461.36]  But how many of you are happy with your current iPhone right now?
[3464.04 --> 3466.04]  Or the clothes that you wear every day?
[3466.04 --> 3469.70]  Or the vehicle that you drive?
[3470.70 --> 3473.08]  Or the camping trailer you've had for years?
[3474.46 --> 3477.04]  Or the kitchen that you have with the old-timey cabinets?
[3479.30 --> 3483.02]  How many of you saw a vacation that a friend went on and thought, ah, I could use that?
[3483.58 --> 3488.50]  Or saw a picture of a friend in their backyard saying, ah, I wish my yard looked like that?
[3488.50 --> 3492.14]  This mindset is widespread.
[3494.86 --> 3497.10]  In one of her books, Susan White says this.
[3497.16 --> 3498.58]  I've paraphrased it a little bit for length.
[3498.64 --> 3499.36]  But she says this.
[3499.70 --> 3504.04]  If there's an overarching story that explains reality in the late 20th century,
[3504.82 --> 3507.36]  it is surely the story of the free market economy.
[3507.92 --> 3512.48]  In the beginning of the story is the self-made, self-sufficient human being.
[3512.86 --> 3516.64]  And at the end of the story is the big house, the big car, and the expensive clothes.
[3516.64 --> 3524.56]  However, in the middle is the struggle for success, the greed, the getting and spending in a world
[3524.56 --> 3526.56]  where there is no such thing as a free lunch.
[3527.96 --> 3535.86]  Most of us have made this so thoroughly our story that we are hardly aware of its influence.
[3537.88 --> 3541.32]  This is only more true in the 21st century as well.
[3541.32 --> 3549.12]  This false gospel of accumulating more for our own good is embedded in the fabric of the world that we live in.
[3549.32 --> 3553.46]  And we wrap ourselves in it every day and maybe don't even realize it.
[3555.06 --> 3558.88]  But when we depend on the accumulation of things for our joy,
[3558.96 --> 3564.78]  this false gospel takes root in our hearts and starts confusing gratitude with greed.
[3564.78 --> 3570.58]  Our contentment then becomes dependent on the next Amazon box that ends up on our front porch.
[3572.50 --> 3575.34]  But Proverbs 23, 4 to 5 tell us a different truth.
[3575.44 --> 3576.36]  It warns us by saying,
[3576.74 --> 3578.76]  Do not wear yourself out to get rich.
[3579.12 --> 3581.54]  Riches sprout wings and fly off.
[3581.84 --> 3585.62]  Do not seek the material because the material is fleeting.
[3585.62 --> 3589.70]  The teacher knew this thousands of years ago,
[3590.00 --> 3595.94]  even before the idea of online shopping, instant purchasing, and Jeff Bezos even existed.
[3597.02 --> 3599.38]  In verses 11 and 12 of our text, he says this,
[3599.38 --> 3602.48]  As goods increase, so do those who consume them.
[3602.74 --> 3607.32]  And what benefit are they to the owners except to feast their eyes on them?
[3608.94 --> 3611.78]  The sleep of a laborer is sweet whether they eat little or much,
[3611.86 --> 3615.34]  but as for the rich, their abundance permits them no sleep.
[3616.62 --> 3618.64]  For those who keep accumulating,
[3619.06 --> 3622.30]  their only joy they have that the possessions brings them
[3622.30 --> 3625.62]  is the fleeting pleasure of looking at them.
[3626.82 --> 3627.88]  What a waste.
[3631.10 --> 3635.66]  The desire for more things actually increases our pressures and our stresses too.
[3635.74 --> 3638.16]  The teacher says with more wealth, with more possessions,
[3638.44 --> 3640.62]  comes more stress and less sleep.
[3640.88 --> 3642.04]  There's more bills to pay.
[3642.26 --> 3643.52]  There's more things to care for.
[3643.62 --> 3645.00]  There's more eyes on you.
[3645.00 --> 3646.72]  Looking at you with what you've got.
[3646.88 --> 3649.72]  There's more worry about losing what you have.
[3650.24 --> 3651.32]  We accomplish things.
[3651.42 --> 3652.48]  We accumulate stuff.
[3652.68 --> 3654.52]  And once we have what we thought we wanted,
[3654.68 --> 3657.72]  we need to work at keeping it and maintaining it,
[3657.72 --> 3659.08]  and then not losing it,
[3659.24 --> 3660.34]  and then updating it,
[3660.42 --> 3662.16]  and then eventually upgrading it.
[3662.16 --> 3664.08]  And the cycle keeps going.
[3666.08 --> 3670.28]  The comfort our stuff brings usually just leads us to more anxiety
[3670.28 --> 3672.50]  and an even greater desire for more,
[3672.88 --> 3675.54]  which does not sound like a promise of joy,
[3675.72 --> 3678.14]  but actually sounds like a promise that binds us.
[3678.14 --> 3685.52]  The third false gospel that the teacher brings to our attention is this.
[3685.86 --> 3689.38]  Your legacy is tied to what you leave behind.
[3689.38 --> 3694.26]  The desire for our own legacy is real.
[3694.60 --> 3698.74]  The desire promises us that we can outlive our own mortality
[3698.74 --> 3700.78]  by curating a bunch of stuff,
[3700.98 --> 3705.00]  be that possessions or successes or businesses or estates,
[3705.10 --> 3708.72]  that they will exist and point to us after we die.
[3708.72 --> 3711.48]  And our culture preaches the idea
[3711.48 --> 3713.54]  that we are called to leave a mark in this world.
[3713.88 --> 3714.44]  Leave a mark!
[3715.28 --> 3717.10]  And that the legacy we leave behind
[3717.10 --> 3720.58]  can be a permanent fixture in our little sphere of influence.
[3721.58 --> 3722.78]  Your legacy matters,
[3722.98 --> 3724.72]  so let's spend our time ensuring
[3725.30 --> 3728.92]  that what we leave behind will enshrine us forever.
[3730.54 --> 3733.12]  And this false gospel takes root in our hearts,
[3733.18 --> 3736.06]  and we start believing that our value is dependent
[3736.06 --> 3737.68]  on what we leave behind.
[3737.68 --> 3739.36]  And so we build up businesses
[3739.36 --> 3741.38]  that we hope will last the tail of time,
[3741.58 --> 3744.30]  only to have them sold off or bought out
[3744.30 --> 3745.86]  or absorbed by another company
[3745.86 --> 3747.26]  as soon as we relinquish control.
[3747.88 --> 3750.94]  We buy property in the hopes that generations of our family
[3750.94 --> 3753.90]  will live on this for generations to come,
[3753.98 --> 3757.20]  only to have housing markets and family dynamics
[3757.20 --> 3760.06]  shift in ways that makes handing those off impossible.
[3760.86 --> 3763.06]  We build up storehouses of goods,
[3763.50 --> 3765.90]  hoping to pass off our things to future generations,
[3765.90 --> 3769.16]  only to have those things get sorted through a thrift store
[3769.16 --> 3770.72]  and donated to Goodwill
[3770.72 --> 3773.44]  as they are replaced by the better and the newer.
[3776.32 --> 3778.04]  Some, though, try to buck this trend.
[3778.12 --> 3780.84]  Instead of passing off their legacies to other people,
[3780.92 --> 3782.42]  they realize maybe that won't work,
[3782.98 --> 3784.62]  so they try to cheat death themselves.
[3785.58 --> 3787.72]  There's a good example of this happening right now
[3787.72 --> 3788.70]  in Southern California,
[3788.70 --> 3790.32]  a man named Brian Johnson.
[3790.32 --> 3791.50]  He's a tech entrepreneur.
[3791.96 --> 3794.00]  He's made hundreds of millions of dollars
[3794.00 --> 3794.84]  with his tech company,
[3795.02 --> 3796.10]  and with his wealth,
[3796.30 --> 3798.10]  he has dedicated his life
[3798.10 --> 3800.86]  and poured millions and millions of dollars
[3800.86 --> 3803.00]  into a personal project called Blueprint,
[3803.42 --> 3805.12]  where he hopes to be the first person
[3805.12 --> 3806.50]  to live well beyond the age of 200.
[3807.52 --> 3809.40]  The guy takes over 100 pills a day.
[3810.38 --> 3812.80]  He follows a rigid diet and sleep routine.
[3812.80 --> 3816.04]  He undergoes a range of experimental treatments,
[3816.24 --> 3818.64]  all in an effort to extend his life
[3818.64 --> 3819.74]  a little bit longer.
[3821.84 --> 3822.46]  And this highlight,
[3823.24 --> 3824.38]  or this example, sorry,
[3824.48 --> 3826.38]  highlights a modern obsession
[3826.38 --> 3828.94]  that we have with control and immortality,
[3829.02 --> 3830.72]  the belief that with enough money
[3830.72 --> 3832.12]  and enough technology,
[3832.32 --> 3834.68]  we can outsmart even our own mortality,
[3835.24 --> 3837.80]  and we can actually be our own legacies.
[3837.80 --> 3841.22]  Now, obviously, I'm not saying
[3841.22 --> 3842.34]  we're all Brian Johnsons,
[3843.12 --> 3844.20]  but let's be honest.
[3844.76 --> 3846.60]  How many of us live for these legacies?
[3847.66 --> 3849.80]  How many of us hope that our businesses
[3849.80 --> 3851.62]  or our properties or our possessions
[3851.62 --> 3854.06]  will leave a mark in this world?
[3854.20 --> 3856.20]  Or maybe we fear aging so much
[3856.20 --> 3858.48]  that we pour a small fortune
[3858.48 --> 3860.00]  into what we call self-care,
[3860.84 --> 3863.50]  trying to hang on to some imagined state
[3863.50 --> 3865.18]  of physical prowess
[3865.18 --> 3866.62]  for just a little bit longer.
[3866.62 --> 3870.72]  But death and aging,
[3870.84 --> 3871.86]  they come for all of us,
[3871.90 --> 3873.26]  no matter how many pills we take,
[3873.46 --> 3875.14]  how many experiments we run,
[3875.34 --> 3876.72]  how many surgeries we seek,
[3876.94 --> 3878.46]  how much Botox we inject,
[3878.68 --> 3879.92]  how much money we spend.
[3882.60 --> 3886.10]  The marks that we try to leave on this world
[3886.10 --> 3887.40]  often fade away.
[3888.30 --> 3891.66]  And the marks we try to fade away on ourselves
[3891.66 --> 3892.96]  always come back.
[3894.14 --> 3895.98]  Because as the teacher says,
[3896.62 --> 3899.28]  everything is meaningless under the sun.
[3900.58 --> 3903.02]  Verse 14 and 15 of our passage tells us this.
[3903.40 --> 3903.52]  It says,
[3903.52 --> 3905.56]  I have seen grievous evil under the sun,
[3905.68 --> 3907.92]  wealth hoarded to the harm of its owners,
[3907.92 --> 3910.14]  or wealth lost through some misfortune,
[3910.50 --> 3911.74]  so that when they have children,
[3911.86 --> 3913.24]  there is nothing left for them to inherit.
[3913.84 --> 3915.84]  Everyone comes naked from their mother's wounds,
[3916.10 --> 3917.26]  and as everyone comes,
[3917.32 --> 3917.88]  so they depart.
[3918.16 --> 3919.64]  They take nothing from their toil
[3919.64 --> 3921.10]  that they can carry in their hands.
[3922.54 --> 3923.90]  The teacher is telling us
[3923.90 --> 3925.94]  that if we are spending too much of our time
[3925.94 --> 3928.00]  hoping that our wealth or our possessions
[3928.00 --> 3929.74]  or our efforts will leave behind
[3929.74 --> 3930.76]  some sort of legacy,
[3930.76 --> 3932.26]  we're actually mistaken.
[3933.20 --> 3935.26]  Because that pursuit ends in emptiness.
[3936.22 --> 3938.80]  The pursuit of money captures our will.
[3939.76 --> 3943.48]  Possession that we hoard just binds us
[3943.48 --> 3945.06]  and our hands.
[3946.42 --> 3949.20]  Legacy of materials chains us to toil.
[3949.20 --> 3953.20]  And yes, this has been a depressing sermon so far,
[3953.26 --> 3954.08]  but here's the shift.
[3955.44 --> 3957.20]  Because the teacher points us
[3957.20 --> 3959.14]  to where we can find our freedom.
[3961.22 --> 3963.90]  In the gift of joy
[3963.90 --> 3966.54]  that comes from our God.
[3968.26 --> 3969.86]  Verses 18 to 20
[3969.86 --> 3971.84]  point us to the gift of joy
[3971.84 --> 3972.98]  that can be found
[3972.98 --> 3974.04]  not in wealth,
[3974.58 --> 3975.56]  not in possessions,
[3975.92 --> 3977.24]  not in a future legacy,
[3977.24 --> 3979.32]  but in God himself.
[3980.52 --> 3981.22]  The teacher says,
[3981.72 --> 3982.90]  this is what I have observed
[3982.90 --> 3983.84]  to be good.
[3984.88 --> 3985.80]  That it is appropriate
[3985.80 --> 3987.12]  for a person to eat
[3987.12 --> 3987.98]  and drink
[3987.98 --> 3989.48]  and to find satisfaction
[3989.48 --> 3990.64]  in their toilsome labor
[3990.64 --> 3991.28]  under the sun
[3991.28 --> 3993.64]  during the few days of life
[3993.64 --> 3995.40]  God has given them.
[3996.38 --> 3997.36]  For this is their lot.
[3998.48 --> 3998.92]  Moreover,
[3999.52 --> 4000.82]  when God gives someone
[4000.82 --> 4001.74]  wealth and possessions,
[4002.32 --> 4002.86]  notice that,
[4003.06 --> 4004.18]  when God gives someone
[4004.18 --> 4004.98]  wealth and possessions
[4004.98 --> 4006.82]  and the ability to enjoy them,
[4007.04 --> 4007.94]  to accept their lot
[4007.94 --> 4008.96]  and be happy in their toil,
[4009.32 --> 4011.18]  this is a gift of God.
[4012.18 --> 4013.20]  They seldom reflect
[4013.20 --> 4014.22]  on the days of their life
[4014.22 --> 4016.06]  because God keeps them
[4016.06 --> 4017.66]  occupied with gladness
[4017.66 --> 4018.40]  of their hearts.
[4020.32 --> 4021.98]  Focus here is not on the fact
[4021.98 --> 4022.84]  that joy comes from
[4022.84 --> 4023.76]  the gifts we have,
[4023.84 --> 4025.08]  but that joy comes from
[4025.08 --> 4026.16]  God himself
[4026.16 --> 4027.08]  who gives gifts.
[4028.06 --> 4029.14]  We can find joy
[4029.14 --> 4030.14]  in any situation,
[4030.42 --> 4031.34]  whether we are rich
[4031.34 --> 4032.00]  or poor,
[4032.00 --> 4032.88]  whether we have little
[4032.88 --> 4033.68]  or lots,
[4033.74 --> 4035.58]  because joy is found
[4035.58 --> 4036.36]  in Christ.
[4037.34 --> 4038.44]  Not in what we have,
[4038.54 --> 4039.30]  not in what we possess,
[4039.72 --> 4040.38]  not in what we try
[4040.38 --> 4041.76]  to accumulate or earn,
[4041.96 --> 4042.86]  not in the legacy
[4042.86 --> 4043.96]  we're trying to leave behind.
[4046.12 --> 4046.90]  Paul, in his letter
[4046.90 --> 4047.60]  to the Philippians,
[4047.98 --> 4049.44]  just demonstrates this
[4049.44 --> 4050.76]  beautifully in his testimony.
[4051.26 --> 4052.20]  He says to the believers
[4052.20 --> 4053.20]  in Philippians there,
[4053.50 --> 4054.30]  in Philippians 4,
[4054.34 --> 4054.96]  11 to 13,
[4055.04 --> 4055.56]  he says this,
[4056.24 --> 4056.64]  Paul says,
[4056.74 --> 4057.88]  I am not saying this,
[4058.00 --> 4058.70]  and what he's not saying
[4058.70 --> 4059.54]  was what he had just written,
[4059.54 --> 4060.84]  I am not saying this
[4060.84 --> 4061.90]  because I am in need,
[4062.68 --> 4063.60]  for I have learned
[4063.60 --> 4064.72]  to be content
[4064.72 --> 4066.12]  wherever the circumstance.
[4067.10 --> 4068.42]  I know what it is like
[4068.42 --> 4069.00]  to be in need,
[4069.06 --> 4069.96]  and I know what it is like
[4069.96 --> 4070.86]  to have plenty.
[4071.16 --> 4072.28]  I have learned the secret
[4072.28 --> 4073.50]  of being content
[4073.50 --> 4075.96]  in every situation,
[4076.28 --> 4077.30]  whether well-fed
[4077.30 --> 4078.20]  or hungry,
[4078.50 --> 4079.56]  whether living in plenty
[4079.56 --> 4080.72]  or in want.
[4080.92 --> 4082.82]  I can do all this
[4082.82 --> 4083.86]  through him
[4083.86 --> 4085.20]  who gives me strength.
[4086.52 --> 4087.64]  And that's referencing
[4087.64 --> 4088.36]  Nehemiah
[4088.36 --> 4089.58]  in the Old Testament
[4089.58 --> 4090.54]  who was reminding
[4090.54 --> 4091.58]  God's people
[4091.58 --> 4092.52]  after exile
[4092.52 --> 4093.72]  that the joy
[4093.72 --> 4094.80]  of the Lord
[4094.80 --> 4096.12]  is their strength.
[4097.34 --> 4098.30]  The joy
[4098.30 --> 4099.20]  of the Lord
[4099.20 --> 4100.22]  is your strength.
[4102.86 --> 4103.62]  See, true joy
[4103.62 --> 4104.74]  is rooted in gratitude
[4104.74 --> 4105.36]  to Jesus
[4105.36 --> 4106.50]  and trust
[4106.50 --> 4107.38]  in his gospel.
[4108.40 --> 4109.28]  This should change
[4109.28 --> 4110.22]  how we view our money
[4110.22 --> 4111.22]  and our stuff
[4111.22 --> 4112.18]  and our legacies
[4112.18 --> 4113.66]  because when we release
[4113.66 --> 4114.90]  our grasp,
[4115.00 --> 4115.18]  sorry,
[4115.28 --> 4116.00]  when we release
[4116.00 --> 4116.92]  our grasp
[4116.92 --> 4117.88]  on our wealth,
[4118.36 --> 4119.28]  and we rest
[4119.28 --> 4120.20]  in God's care,
[4120.88 --> 4121.72]  we can enjoy
[4121.72 --> 4122.80]  what he gives us
[4122.80 --> 4124.26]  without being
[4124.26 --> 4125.82]  enslaved to it.
[4127.74 --> 4128.92]  If the pursuit
[4128.92 --> 4129.46]  of wealth
[4129.46 --> 4130.24]  binds us
[4130.24 --> 4131.00]  and possessions
[4131.00 --> 4131.98]  handcuff us
[4131.98 --> 4132.76]  and the pursuit
[4132.76 --> 4133.70]  of immortality
[4133.70 --> 4134.58]  chains us
[4134.58 --> 4135.08]  to a ball
[4135.08 --> 4136.18]  that cannot move,
[4137.84 --> 4138.20]  resting
[4138.20 --> 4140.08]  in God's care
[4140.08 --> 4141.16]  allows us
[4141.16 --> 4141.98]  to find joy
[4141.98 --> 4142.82]  in this world
[4142.82 --> 4143.72]  that does not
[4143.72 --> 4144.46]  enslave us
[4144.46 --> 4146.72]  because it's not
[4146.72 --> 4147.20]  the pursuit
[4147.20 --> 4147.64]  of wealth
[4147.64 --> 4148.18]  that will meet
[4148.18 --> 4148.66]  our needs.
[4148.74 --> 4149.30]  It's the pursuit
[4149.30 --> 4149.84]  of Christ.
[4150.86 --> 4151.66]  It is Jesus
[4151.66 --> 4152.86]  who came down
[4152.86 --> 4153.58]  into this earth
[4153.58 --> 4154.74]  as God incarnate
[4154.74 --> 4156.10]  and he made himself
[4156.10 --> 4156.58]  nothing,
[4156.94 --> 4158.14]  taking on human flesh.
[4158.38 --> 4159.74]  He lived the perfect life
[4159.74 --> 4160.38]  that you and I
[4160.38 --> 4161.04]  fail to live
[4161.04 --> 4162.18]  each and every day
[4162.18 --> 4163.16]  and then he died
[4163.16 --> 4163.54]  to death
[4163.54 --> 4164.56]  taking on the weight
[4164.56 --> 4165.22]  of sin
[4165.22 --> 4166.30]  on his shoulders.
[4166.30 --> 4169.46]  He died
[4169.46 --> 4171.22]  but death
[4171.22 --> 4172.10]  couldn't defeat him
[4172.10 --> 4173.42]  and three days later
[4173.42 --> 4174.22]  he rose again
[4174.22 --> 4174.86]  from the tomb
[4174.86 --> 4175.94]  defeating sin
[4175.94 --> 4177.16]  once and for all
[4177.16 --> 4178.00]  and salvation
[4178.00 --> 4178.98]  is found for you
[4178.98 --> 4179.98]  and for me
[4179.98 --> 4180.74]  because of what
[4180.74 --> 4181.66]  he did.
[4182.80 --> 4184.10]  Not by any amount
[4184.10 --> 4184.72]  you make
[4184.72 --> 4186.52]  or I make
[4186.52 --> 4188.32]  your eternal
[4188.32 --> 4189.28]  needs
[4189.28 --> 4190.44]  are found in him
[4190.44 --> 4192.82]  in the truth
[4192.82 --> 4193.64]  of Jesus Christ
[4193.64 --> 4195.38]  and it's not
[4195.38 --> 4196.04]  the accumulation
[4196.04 --> 4196.78]  of things
[4196.78 --> 4197.68]  that will bring us joy
[4197.68 --> 4198.42]  but the hope
[4198.42 --> 4199.26]  we have in Jesus
[4199.26 --> 4200.18]  that brings us joy.
[4200.48 --> 4201.30]  See true joy
[4201.30 --> 4201.68]  is knowing
[4201.68 --> 4202.28]  that we belong
[4202.28 --> 4202.74]  to him.
[4203.96 --> 4204.68]  He has paved
[4204.68 --> 4205.26]  a way forward
[4205.26 --> 4206.06]  that no amount
[4206.06 --> 4206.72]  of things
[4206.72 --> 4207.20]  could ever.
[4208.28 --> 4209.36]  The joy we chase
[4209.36 --> 4210.30]  in the emptiness
[4210.30 --> 4211.90]  of material goods
[4211.90 --> 4213.08]  can only be found
[4213.08 --> 4213.78]  eternally
[4213.78 --> 4215.06]  in the kingdom come
[4215.06 --> 4215.98]  and the kingdom coming
[4215.98 --> 4219.06]  of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[4220.96 --> 4221.92]  When we can see
[4221.92 --> 4222.66]  this clearly
[4222.66 --> 4224.72]  we'll stop clinging
[4224.72 --> 4225.40]  so tightly
[4225.40 --> 4226.44]  to our little toys
[4226.44 --> 4227.56]  and we'll remember
[4227.56 --> 4229.16]  the king of the cosmos
[4229.16 --> 4230.26]  is coming
[4230.26 --> 4232.00]  and we will reign
[4232.00 --> 4232.64]  with him
[4232.64 --> 4233.82]  for all eternity.
[4234.60 --> 4235.82]  That is joy.
[4237.42 --> 4238.72]  And knowing that
[4238.72 --> 4240.42]  it's not what we leave
[4240.42 --> 4240.94]  behind
[4240.94 --> 4241.78]  that's our legacy
[4241.78 --> 4243.72]  but our faith
[4243.72 --> 4244.60]  in Jesus
[4244.60 --> 4245.74]  allows us
[4245.74 --> 4247.16]  that legacy
[4247.16 --> 4247.88]  to live forever.
[4248.52 --> 4249.26]  We do not need
[4249.26 --> 4249.94]  to worry about
[4249.94 --> 4250.44]  our legacy
[4250.44 --> 4251.06]  here on earth
[4251.06 --> 4252.04]  if we live out
[4252.04 --> 4252.76]  the faith
[4252.76 --> 4253.54]  that God
[4253.54 --> 4254.28]  has secured
[4254.28 --> 4255.14]  for us in Jesus.
[4255.50 --> 4256.20]  The inheritance
[4256.20 --> 4256.98]  of the kingdom
[4256.98 --> 4257.68]  of God
[4257.68 --> 4258.28]  is given
[4258.28 --> 4259.24]  to all who believe.
[4260.20 --> 4260.82]  And when we live
[4260.82 --> 4261.60]  out that faith
[4261.60 --> 4262.62]  our legacy
[4262.62 --> 4263.34]  becomes part
[4263.34 --> 4264.00]  of the story
[4264.00 --> 4264.40]  that God
[4264.40 --> 4265.18]  has already written
[4265.18 --> 4266.74]  alongside the heroes
[4266.74 --> 4267.20]  of faith
[4267.20 --> 4268.06]  that we read about
[4268.06 --> 4269.14]  in Hebrews 11
[4269.14 --> 4270.06]  of Enoch
[4270.06 --> 4270.60]  and Noah
[4270.60 --> 4271.32]  and Abraham
[4271.32 --> 4272.04]  and Isaac
[4272.04 --> 4272.60]  Jacob
[4272.60 --> 4273.26]  Joseph
[4273.26 --> 4273.86]  Moses
[4273.86 --> 4274.56]  Rahab
[4274.56 --> 4275.20]  Gideon
[4275.20 --> 4275.80]  Samuel
[4275.80 --> 4276.34]  David
[4276.34 --> 4277.62]  the prophets
[4277.62 --> 4278.98]  they've all
[4278.98 --> 4279.86]  left this legacy
[4279.86 --> 4280.46]  of faith
[4280.46 --> 4282.00]  for believers
[4282.00 --> 4282.68]  throughout time
[4282.68 --> 4283.66]  and that's a legacy
[4283.66 --> 4285.18]  worth being a part of.
[4286.90 --> 4288.20]  And so our big idea
[4288.20 --> 4289.08]  today is this
[4289.08 --> 4291.60]  joy isn't found
[4291.60 --> 4292.68]  in what we gain
[4292.68 --> 4294.68]  but in the God
[4294.68 --> 4295.38]  we trust.
[4297.14 --> 4298.72]  Joy isn't found
[4298.72 --> 4299.74]  in what we gain
[4299.74 --> 4300.90]  but in the God
[4300.90 --> 4301.50]  we trust.
[4303.00 --> 4304.24]  So how do we live
[4304.24 --> 4306.60]  out this faith legacy
[4306.60 --> 4307.84]  in a culture
[4307.84 --> 4308.86]  that preaches
[4308.86 --> 4310.20]  these false gospels?
[4312.06 --> 4313.54]  When we trust God
[4313.54 --> 4314.70]  and we place our hope
[4314.70 --> 4316.24]  in the gospel truth
[4316.24 --> 4316.74]  of Jesus
[4316.74 --> 4318.58]  we stop chasing wealth
[4318.58 --> 4320.16]  we stop chasing possessions
[4320.16 --> 4321.38]  we stop chasing
[4321.38 --> 4322.06]  the legacies
[4322.06 --> 4323.20]  that can bog us down
[4323.20 --> 4323.96]  and instead
[4323.96 --> 4325.50]  we begin to live
[4325.50 --> 4326.34]  in ways
[4326.34 --> 4327.50]  that resist
[4327.50 --> 4328.36]  the gospels
[4328.36 --> 4329.00]  of our world.
[4330.54 --> 4331.56]  So we are called
[4331.56 --> 4332.10]  to develop
[4332.10 --> 4332.94]  these rhythms
[4332.94 --> 4333.82]  of resistance
[4333.82 --> 4335.80]  which help us
[4335.80 --> 4336.58]  counter the world's
[4336.58 --> 4337.30]  empty promises
[4337.30 --> 4338.20]  with a faithful
[4338.20 --> 4339.42]  and practical
[4339.42 --> 4340.50]  responses
[4340.50 --> 4341.58]  in our daily lives.
[4342.18 --> 4342.78]  Now these rhythms
[4342.78 --> 4343.48]  of resistance
[4343.48 --> 4344.84]  a term which was coined
[4344.84 --> 4345.32]  by a ministry
[4345.32 --> 4346.02]  called surge
[4346.02 --> 4347.16]  they're spiritual gifts
[4347.16 --> 4348.20]  sorry
[4348.20 --> 4349.20]  they're spiritual disciplines
[4349.20 --> 4351.04]  and these spiritual disciplines
[4351.04 --> 4352.10]  they combat
[4352.10 --> 4353.86]  these false gospels
[4353.86 --> 4355.24]  and redirect us
[4355.24 --> 4355.88]  to that joy
[4355.88 --> 4356.58]  that we find
[4356.58 --> 4357.34]  in Jesus.
[4358.24 --> 4359.04]  In a world
[4359.04 --> 4359.92]  as broken as ours
[4359.92 --> 4360.76]  these rhythms help.
[4362.22 --> 4363.28]  So for example
[4363.28 --> 4364.72]  in a consumeristic
[4364.72 --> 4366.08]  overfed
[4366.08 --> 4367.56]  never enough
[4367.56 --> 4368.80]  Amazon culture
[4368.80 --> 4370.00]  fasting
[4370.00 --> 4371.34]  is an act
[4371.34 --> 4371.86]  of resistance.
[4372.80 --> 4374.04]  In a loud
[4374.04 --> 4374.90]  noisy
[4374.90 --> 4376.00]  distracting
[4376.00 --> 4378.40]  economy culture
[4378.40 --> 4380.04]  silence
[4380.04 --> 4381.16]  and solitude
[4381.16 --> 4382.28]  is an act
[4382.28 --> 4382.80]  of resistance.
[4383.88 --> 4385.16]  In a quick
[4385.16 --> 4385.50]  fixed
[4385.50 --> 4385.98]  personal
[4385.98 --> 4386.54]  and polarized
[4386.54 --> 4387.18]  culture
[4387.18 --> 4387.88]  lament
[4387.88 --> 4388.84]  is an act
[4388.84 --> 4389.40]  of resistance.
[4389.56 --> 4390.92]  In a hyper
[4390.92 --> 4392.20]  individualistic
[4392.20 --> 4393.34]  self-love
[4393.34 --> 4394.24]  autonomous
[4394.24 --> 4394.86]  culture
[4394.86 --> 4395.74]  community
[4395.74 --> 4396.92]  is an act
[4396.92 --> 4397.78]  of resistance.
[4398.56 --> 4400.46]  In a nationalistic
[4400.46 --> 4401.64]  party over country
[4401.64 --> 4402.92]  politically
[4402.92 --> 4403.70]  aggressive
[4403.70 --> 4404.38]  culture
[4404.38 --> 4405.84]  worship
[4405.84 --> 4407.08]  is an act
[4407.08 --> 4407.78]  of resistance.
[4408.56 --> 4409.68]  In a power
[4409.68 --> 4410.10]  hungry
[4410.10 --> 4410.98]  success
[4410.98 --> 4411.64]  oriented
[4411.64 --> 4412.52]  appearance
[4412.52 --> 4412.84]  driven
[4412.84 --> 4413.44]  culture
[4413.44 --> 4414.56]  confession
[4414.56 --> 4415.74]  is an act
[4415.74 --> 4416.56]  of resistance.
[4417.56 --> 4419.12]  In a rationalistic
[4419.12 --> 4420.04]  data driven
[4420.04 --> 4420.90]  calculated
[4420.90 --> 4421.70]  culture
[4421.70 --> 4423.04]  prayer
[4423.04 --> 4424.44]  is an act
[4424.44 --> 4425.58]  of resistance.
[4426.88 --> 4428.18]  In a 24-7
[4428.18 --> 4428.82]  restless
[4428.82 --> 4429.66]  work addicted
[4429.66 --> 4430.60]  anxious
[4430.60 --> 4431.40]  presence
[4431.40 --> 4432.24]  culture
[4432.24 --> 4433.80]  Sabbath
[4433.80 --> 4435.80]  is an act
[4435.80 --> 4437.06]  of resistance.
[4438.70 --> 4439.94]  See in a culture
[4439.94 --> 4440.44]  that preaches
[4440.44 --> 4441.52]  so many false
[4441.52 --> 4441.98]  gospels
[4441.98 --> 4442.68]  we must
[4442.68 --> 4443.38]  practice
[4443.38 --> 4444.08]  these acts
[4444.08 --> 4445.10]  of resistance
[4445.10 --> 4445.64]  not because
[4445.64 --> 4445.94]  they will
[4445.94 --> 4446.48]  save us
[4446.48 --> 4447.34]  Jesus did
[4447.34 --> 4447.94]  that already
[4447.94 --> 4449.98]  but because
[4449.98 --> 4450.24]  they will
[4450.24 --> 4450.78]  help us
[4450.78 --> 4451.32]  cut through
[4451.32 --> 4452.06]  the noise
[4452.06 --> 4453.22]  they'll
[4453.22 --> 4454.04]  cut through
[4454.04 --> 4454.58]  the false
[4454.58 --> 4455.20]  gospels
[4455.20 --> 4456.06]  and point
[4456.06 --> 4456.36]  us to
[4456.36 --> 4456.82]  the only
[4456.82 --> 4457.10]  true
[4457.10 --> 4457.42]  gospel
[4457.42 --> 4458.12]  that exists
[4458.12 --> 4459.06]  Jesus
[4459.06 --> 4459.50]  Christ
[4459.50 --> 4460.28]  wealth
[4460.28 --> 4461.10]  status
[4461.10 --> 4461.74]  possessions
[4461.74 --> 4462.30]  legacies
[4462.30 --> 4463.30]  even life
[4463.30 --> 4463.78]  itself
[4463.78 --> 4465.14]  it all
[4465.14 --> 4465.54]  fades
[4465.54 --> 4467.34]  but the
[4467.34 --> 4467.80]  joy
[4467.80 --> 4468.52]  of the
[4468.52 --> 4468.94]  Lord
[4468.94 --> 4469.58]  is our
[4469.58 --> 4470.14]  strength
[4470.14 --> 4471.38]  and as
[4471.38 --> 4471.72]  we become
[4471.72 --> 4472.54]  more aware
[4472.54 --> 4473.00]  of these
[4473.00 --> 4473.30]  false
[4473.30 --> 4473.86]  gospels
[4473.86 --> 4474.14]  in our
[4474.14 --> 4474.44]  world
[4474.44 --> 4475.30]  may we
[4475.30 --> 4475.70]  truly
[4475.70 --> 4476.22]  come to
[4476.22 --> 4476.88]  understand
[4476.88 --> 4477.44]  more and
[4477.44 --> 4477.84]  more that
[4477.84 --> 4478.78]  joy is
[4478.78 --> 4479.48]  not found
[4479.48 --> 4479.78]  in what
[4479.78 --> 4480.42]  we gain
[4480.42 --> 4481.38]  but in
[4481.38 --> 4481.76]  the God
[4481.76 --> 4482.36]  we trust
[4482.36 --> 4484.12]  so may we
[4484.12 --> 4484.52]  think on
[4484.52 --> 4485.08]  those spiritual
[4485.08 --> 4485.50]  disciplines
[4485.50 --> 4487.50]  those acts
[4487.50 --> 4488.48]  and rhythms
[4488.48 --> 4489.12]  of resistance
[4489.12 --> 4489.88]  and ponder
[4489.88 --> 4490.60]  how we
[4490.60 --> 4491.98]  can continue
[4491.98 --> 4492.80]  to incorporate
[4492.80 --> 4493.52]  them into
[4493.52 --> 4494.18]  our daily
[4494.18 --> 4495.08]  lives
[4495.08 --> 4495.78]  using them
[4495.78 --> 4496.42]  both to
[4496.42 --> 4496.96]  resist the
[4496.96 --> 4497.24]  false
[4497.24 --> 4497.78]  gospels
[4497.78 --> 4498.22]  that are
[4498.22 --> 4498.64]  out there
[4498.64 --> 4499.36]  but also
[4499.36 --> 4500.00]  to disciple
[4500.00 --> 4500.62]  one another
[4500.62 --> 4502.04]  and point
[4502.04 --> 4503.04]  our world
[4503.04 --> 4504.38]  to what
[4504.38 --> 4504.78]  it means
[4504.78 --> 4505.22]  to be a
[4505.22 --> 4505.50]  follower
[4505.50 --> 4506.06]  of Christ
[4506.06 --> 4508.08]  life apart
[4508.08 --> 4508.50]  from God
[4508.50 --> 4508.98]  is meaningless
[4508.98 --> 4509.58]  but with
[4509.58 --> 4509.92]  him
[4509.92 --> 4510.66]  even in
[4510.66 --> 4511.00]  little
[4511.00 --> 4513.26]  life is
[4513.26 --> 4513.56]  full of
[4513.56 --> 4513.84]  joy
[4513.84 --> 4514.90]  amen
[4514.90 --> 4516.24]  let's
[4516.24 --> 4516.46]  pray
[4516.46 --> 4520.64]  our God
[4520.64 --> 4521.04]  in heaven
[4521.04 --> 4522.54]  Lord we
[4522.54 --> 4523.02]  live in a
[4523.02 --> 4523.38]  world
[4523.38 --> 4524.80]  that pushes
[4524.80 --> 4525.26]  so many
[4525.26 --> 4525.80]  things on
[4525.80 --> 4526.08]  us
[4526.08 --> 4527.32]  and God
[4527.32 --> 4527.74]  this is not
[4527.74 --> 4528.04]  a new
[4528.04 --> 4528.28]  thing
[4528.28 --> 4528.64]  even the
[4528.64 --> 4529.12]  teacher here
[4529.12 --> 4529.84]  in Ecclesiastes
[4529.84 --> 4530.50]  saw this
[4530.50 --> 4531.82]  the pursuit
[4531.82 --> 4532.38]  of wealth
[4532.38 --> 4533.52]  the desire
[4533.52 --> 4534.42]  to accumulate
[4534.42 --> 4535.16]  goods
[4535.16 --> 4538.08]  the hope
[4538.08 --> 4538.56]  to leave
[4538.56 --> 4539.28]  behind a
[4539.28 --> 4539.92]  legacy that
[4539.92 --> 4540.46]  will enshrine
[4540.46 --> 4540.96]  us forever
[4540.96 --> 4541.54]  are all
[4541.54 --> 4541.94]  things
[4541.94 --> 4544.08]  that still
[4544.08 --> 4545.12]  bind us
[4545.12 --> 4545.80]  here in
[4545.80 --> 4546.30]  this world
[4546.30 --> 4548.52]  but God
[4548.52 --> 4549.20]  we pray
[4549.20 --> 4551.06]  that we
[4551.06 --> 4551.28]  will be
[4551.28 --> 4551.76]  able to
[4551.76 --> 4553.76]  release
[4553.76 --> 4555.16]  ourselves
[4555.16 --> 4555.94]  from those
[4555.94 --> 4556.46]  gospels
[4556.46 --> 4556.74]  Lord
[4556.74 --> 4557.06]  that we
[4557.06 --> 4557.44]  will be
[4557.44 --> 4557.90]  able to
[4557.90 --> 4558.86]  find the
[4558.86 --> 4559.70]  joy in
[4559.70 --> 4559.98]  you
[4559.98 --> 4560.58]  in your
[4560.58 --> 4560.88]  life
[4560.88 --> 4561.12]  death
[4561.12 --> 4561.28]  and
[4561.28 --> 4561.72]  resurrection
[4561.72 --> 4562.30]  in the
[4562.30 --> 4562.76]  understanding
[4562.76 --> 4563.10]  that you
[4563.10 --> 4563.54]  will come
[4563.54 --> 4563.84]  again
[4563.84 --> 4564.44]  and that we
[4564.44 --> 4565.12]  are eternally
[4565.12 --> 4565.76]  saved and
[4565.76 --> 4566.22]  will reign
[4566.22 --> 4566.72]  with you
[4566.72 --> 4567.68]  over the
[4567.68 --> 4568.20]  new earth
[4568.20 --> 4568.62]  when you
[4568.62 --> 4569.18]  come again
[4569.18 --> 4571.00]  God
[4571.00 --> 4571.56]  may that
[4571.56 --> 4571.96]  be our
[4571.96 --> 4572.30]  focus
[4572.30 --> 4572.84]  may we
[4572.84 --> 4574.06]  practice
[4574.06 --> 4574.84]  rhythms of
[4574.84 --> 4575.30]  resistance
[4575.30 --> 4575.84]  to these
[4575.84 --> 4576.44]  gospels
[4576.44 --> 4577.78]  and regularly
[4577.78 --> 4578.66]  point and
[4578.66 --> 4579.18]  reorient
[4579.18 --> 4579.84]  ourselves back
[4579.84 --> 4580.24]  to you
[4580.24 --> 4581.98]  and God
[4581.98 --> 4582.38]  we pray
[4582.38 --> 4582.88]  that others
[4582.88 --> 4583.56]  will notice
[4583.56 --> 4585.06]  and come
[4585.06 --> 4585.36]  to you
[4585.36 --> 4585.78]  as well
[4585.78 --> 4587.70]  so God
[4587.70 --> 4588.26]  as we
[4588.26 --> 4589.90]  continue
[4589.90 --> 4590.48]  in worship
[4590.48 --> 4590.82]  today
[4590.82 --> 4591.28]  may that
[4591.28 --> 4591.80]  be another
[4591.80 --> 4592.36]  rhythm
[4592.36 --> 4593.02]  of resistance
[4593.02 --> 4593.58]  to the
[4593.58 --> 4593.96]  gospels
[4593.96 --> 4594.26]  of this
[4594.26 --> 4594.60]  world
[4594.60 --> 4595.48]  and may
[4595.48 --> 4595.86]  we worship
[4595.86 --> 4596.12]  you
[4596.12 --> 4596.80]  the only
[4596.80 --> 4597.64]  being
[4597.64 --> 4598.64]  worth
[4598.64 --> 4599.20]  worshiping
[4599.20 --> 4600.08]  we pray
[4600.08 --> 4600.34]  this in
[4600.34 --> 4600.70]  your name
[4600.70 --> 4601.36]  amen
[4601.36 --> 4613.06]  the joy
[4613.06 --> 4627.82]  of the
[4627.82 --> 4629.82]  the
[4629.82 --> 4630.58]  Lord
[4630.58 --> 4632.82]  will be
[4632.82 --> 4633.24]  my
[4633.24 --> 4634.40]  will
[4634.40 --> 4635.32]  not
[4635.32 --> 4636.06]  be
[4636.06 --> 4636.94]  he
[4636.94 --> 4637.50]  is
[4637.50 --> 4637.84]  my
[4637.84 --> 4638.48]  shepherd
[4638.48 --> 4639.14]  I
[4639.14 --> 4639.62]  am
[4639.62 --> 4640.14]  not
[4640.14 --> 4641.04]  afraid
[4641.04 --> 4641.62]  the
[4641.62 --> 4642.18]  joy
[4642.18 --> 4642.92]  of the
[4642.92 --> 4643.44]  Lord
[4643.44 --> 4643.88]  is
[4643.88 --> 4644.38]  my
[4644.38 --> 4645.94]  strength
[4645.94 --> 4646.74]  the
[4646.74 --> 4647.30]  joy
[4647.30 --> 4647.94]  of the
[4647.94 --> 4648.74]  Lord
[4648.74 --> 4649.20]  the
[4649.20 --> 4649.74]  joy
[4649.74 --> 4650.20]  of
[4650.20 --> 4650.50]  the
[4650.50 --> 4651.20]  Lord
[4651.20 --> 4651.72]  the
[4651.72 --> 4652.26]  joy
[4652.26 --> 4652.72]  of
[4652.72 --> 4653.00]  the
[4653.00 --> 4653.50]  Lord
[4653.50 --> 4653.96]  is
[4653.96 --> 4654.44]  my
[4654.44 --> 4655.32]  strength
[4655.32 --> 4659.12]  the
[4659.12 --> 4659.70]  joy
[4659.70 --> 4660.16]  of
[4660.16 --> 4660.48]  the
[4660.48 --> 4661.28]  Lord
[4661.28 --> 4662.12]  will
[4662.12 --> 4662.54]  be
[4662.54 --> 4662.94]  my
[4662.94 --> 4663.66]  strength
[4663.66 --> 4664.54]  he
[4664.54 --> 4665.14]  will
[4665.14 --> 4666.06]  uphold
[4666.06 --> 4666.72]  me
[4666.72 --> 4667.28]  all
[4667.28 --> 4667.66]  of
[4667.66 --> 4667.98]  my
[4667.98 --> 4668.88]  days
[4668.88 --> 4669.74]  I
[4669.74 --> 4670.18]  am
[4670.18 --> 4671.04]  surrounded
[4671.04 --> 4671.72]  by
[4671.72 --> 4672.40]  mercy
[4672.40 --> 4673.02]  and
[4673.02 --> 4673.70]  grace
[4673.70 --> 4674.28]  the
[4674.28 --> 4674.76]  joy
