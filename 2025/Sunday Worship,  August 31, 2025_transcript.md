[0.00 --> 5.10]  Where were you the day that I measured?
[6.02 --> 10.16]  Sung the bass and stretched the line over
[10.16 --> 15.88]  All the earth and carved out its cornerstone
[15.88 --> 25.60]  Where were you the day that I spoke and
[25.60 --> 30.26]  Told the sun to split the night open
[30.26 --> 35.92]  Called the morning dawn with its light to shore
[35.92 --> 45.70]  Who shot empty ocean with stone doors
[45.70 --> 50.70]  Marked the reach of tides on those new shores
[50.70 --> 55.86]  On the day the waves rose and first broke forth
[55.86 --> 64.94]  Have you seen the springs of that gray sea?
[65.42 --> 69.50]  Walked the caverns carved in the black sea
[69.50 --> 74.58]  Through the gates of darkness there on its floor
[74.58 --> 83.44]  Have you seen the armory I hold?
[83.74 --> 87.62]  Snow and hail are stacked up in silos
[87.62 --> 92.86]  For the times of trouble and war and strife
[92.86 --> 101.32]  Can you raise your voice to the storm cloud?
[101.32 --> 105.48]  Would the thunder answer and ring out?
[106.00 --> 110.48]  Does the lightning ask you where it should strike?
[114.48 --> 118.32]  Who has cleft a channel for torrents?
[119.04 --> 122.32]  Rain to sprout the desert with forest
[122.88 --> 127.76]  In the wilderness that my hand has filled
[127.76 --> 135.64]  Can you hunt the prey for young lions?
[135.64 --> 139.42]  Can you lose the cords of all riders?
[140.28 --> 142.92]  Is this whole world bending me?
[143.16 --> 144.60]  Need your will?
[147.10 --> 152.70]  I spoke of things I did not understand
[152.70 --> 158.14]  Things too wonderful for me
[158.14 --> 162.58]  Although I have no right to act
[162.58 --> 167.52]  My God knelt and answered me
[167.52 --> 167.86]  Amen
[167.86 --> 171.12]  What gift of grace should be
[171.34 --> 171.96]  God.
[173.80 --> 174.40]  Gracious go benefit.
[178.62 --> 180.74]  Thank you so much!
[180.90 --> 184.80]  Thank you so much for watching
[187.04 --> 188.24]  We're gonna ride and share a little heart
[188.24 --> 192.34]  Can you feel that I've seen on this Lös ineff wasn't
[192.54 --> 193.18]  Thy leg a newange
[193.18 --> 193.80]  I listen kiss
[193.80 --> 195.70]  husband I think what else do I want
[195.70 --> 198.70]  He is Jesus, my redeemer.
[199.62 --> 205.14]  There is no more for heaven now to give.
[206.32 --> 211.80]  He is my joy, my righteousness, and freedom.
[213.22 --> 218.54]  My steadfast love, my deep and balanced peace.
[219.40 --> 225.42]  To this I go, my hope is only Jesus.
[225.70 --> 231.52]  Oh, my love is holy down to me.
[231.52 --> 238.52]  Oh, how strange and divine I can see.
[238.52 --> 241.60]  All is one yet another.
[242.10 --> 244.74]  There's no Christ in me.
[255.70 --> 262.10]  The night is up, but I am not forsaken.
[262.10 --> 268.46]  For by my side, the Savior, He will save.
[269.42 --> 275.10]  I labor on in weakness and rejoicing.
[276.40 --> 281.54]  For in my need, His power is displayed.
[281.54 --> 289.26]  To this I hold, my shepherd will defend me.
[289.62 --> 295.16]  Through the deepest valley, He will lead.
[296.94 --> 303.48]  Oh, the night has been won, and I shall overcome.
[303.66 --> 308.30]  Yet not I, earth who crossed in me.
[311.54 --> 319.36]  I wish I could do Jesus.
[319.36 --> 320.96]  You know, faith is fine.
[320.96 --> 325.12]  I know I am ?
[325.12 --> 331.78]  The future's sure, the price has been paid.
[331.78 --> 338.80]  For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon
[338.80 --> 345.34]  And he was raised to all his foes of grace
[345.34 --> 352.08]  To this I hold my sin has been defeated
[352.08 --> 358.46]  Jesus now and ever is my plea
[358.46 --> 363.28]  Oh, the chains are released
[363.28 --> 366.76]  I can sing I am free
[366.76 --> 372.00]  And not I, but through Christ in me
[372.00 --> 388.44]  With every breath I long to follow Jesus
[388.46 --> 395.06]  For he has said that he will wait me home
[395.06 --> 402.76]  And day by day I know he will renew me
[402.76 --> 408.62]  Until I stand with joy before the Lord
[408.62 --> 416.16]  To this I hold my hope is only Jesus
[416.16 --> 421.78]  Oh, the glory evermore to me
[421.78 --> 426.60]  When the race is complete
[426.60 --> 430.18]  To my lips shall be defeated
[430.18 --> 435.00]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me
[435.00 --> 439.82]  When the race is complete
[439.82 --> 440.82]  To my lips shall be defeated
[440.82 --> 446.42]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me
[446.42 --> 453.02]  When the race is complete
[453.02 --> 457.56]  To my lips shall be defeated
[457.56 --> 461.62]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me
[461.62 --> 466.02]  When the race is complete
[466.02 --> 470.02]  To my lips shall be defeated
[470.02 --> 474.62]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me
[474.62 --> 480.22]  You've Got to do Christ in me
[480.22 --> 480.70]  hopes for unto the Lord
[480.70 --> 483.22]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me
[483.22 --> 484.34]  And I, but through Christ in me
[484.34 --> 484.62]  When the race is complete
[484.62 --> 485.32]  I believe we're defeated
[485.32 --> 485.88]  I believe we're defeated
[485.88 --> 487.98]  I believe we're defeated
[487.98 --> 488.92]  I believe we're defeated
[488.92 --> 489.52]  I believe we're defeated
[489.52 --> 489.62]  I believe we're defeated
[489.62 --> 490.22]  I believe we're defeated
[490.22 --> 490.64]  How about you?
[490.64 --> 491.16]  How about you?
[491.16 --> 492.36]  I believe I believe I believe
[492.36 --> 493.16]  How about you?
[493.16 --> 493.76]  How about you?
[493.76 --> 494.68]  Can that hit
[494.68 --> 495.22]  How about you?
[495.22 --> 495.50]  How about you?
[495.50 --> 496.24]  Now come here
[496.24 --> 497.08]  All along
[497.08 --> 498.10]  I believe in a lie
[498.10 --> 499.42]  His love
[499.42 --> 500.58]  It's a conseteenth
[500.58 --> 501.80]  A gim-ira
[501.80 --> 502.06] raft-course not a
[502.06 --> 514.74]  Good morning, everyone.
[516.10 --> 521.20]  Welcome once again to our particular experience of chaos in worship.
[521.20 --> 533.06]  I trust on the way in, you were given the clear instructions on how you're going to get your lyrics for your singing this morning.
[533.40 --> 539.98]  If you weren't, there's QR codes available at the back and on the back of the worship folder that got handed out.
[540.36 --> 543.42]  If you scan that with your phone, that'll take you to a page with the lyrics.
[544.04 --> 547.80]  If you don't have a phone or are unable to use your phone for whatever reason,
[547.80 --> 553.46]  there are a couple sheets available that we've printed that out on, so make sure you grab one of those
[553.46 --> 559.12]  as we persevere through our construction projects together around here.
[559.46 --> 564.64]  Before we begin, we have a couple announcements to make, and so I'm just going to run through those.
[565.56 --> 573.18]  First, today after our worship, we are going to shift the fun over to Topham Park.
[573.38 --> 575.42]  We're going to have a potluck picnic.
[575.42 --> 580.90]  I was instructed to remind you that it's a potluck picnic.
[581.76 --> 590.16]  So bring your own food and bring your own cutlery and whatever you would bring on a picnic to sit on or whatever the case may be.
[590.62 --> 594.64]  We are providing two shade tents and the opportunity.
[595.60 --> 596.78]  You are providing the rest.
[597.76 --> 599.88]  So that's going to happen at Topham Park.
[600.30 --> 602.84]  The information on how to get there is in the e-bulletin.
[602.84 --> 608.48]  If you don't have that but would like to come, you can grab myself or Pastor Kevin after worship,
[608.48 --> 610.90]  and we'll let you know where it is and how to get there.
[612.94 --> 616.00]  Next Sunday is Reactivate.
[616.64 --> 622.14]  So we've got a bunch of youth and leaders from all over B.C. coming here for the weekend.
[622.14 --> 626.50]  And so for our worship next Sunday, we're doing that all together.
[627.06 --> 630.76]  And so it's going to be nice and close quarters together.
[630.98 --> 636.04]  And we want to encourage you as regular worshipers here at Emanuel,
[636.24 --> 638.90]  and especially those of you who are able-bodied,
[639.36 --> 643.32]  to consider parking at the school next door or on the street somewhere
[643.32 --> 647.28]  so that we can allow those who need to park closer to do so,
[647.28 --> 651.46]  and for the fact that our parking lot is going to be full of other people's vehicles and the like.
[651.60 --> 652.98]  So be mindful of that.
[654.24 --> 657.44]  Connected to Reactivate also, just a really big thank you to you
[657.44 --> 659.26]  who have signed up for volunteering.
[659.86 --> 662.74]  A couple weeks ago, there was lots of empty spaces,
[662.74 --> 666.26]  and now there's only two or three volunteer spaces.
[666.38 --> 667.38]  So thank you for that.
[667.48 --> 668.96]  Thank you for stepping up.
[669.04 --> 671.52]  We know that it happens every year, and it's a beautiful testimony.
[671.52 --> 676.04]  If you're still looking for a place to plug in, there are two or three spots available,
[676.28 --> 677.32]  so check that out online.
[680.12 --> 687.08]  Also, we are beginning to ramp up and make plans
[687.08 --> 691.76]  for our regularly scheduled worship and programs here at Emanuel.
[691.98 --> 696.20]  And so over the next couple weeks, there's going to be lots of sign-up sheets
[696.20 --> 698.70]  and volunteer opportunity lists that are going out,
[698.76 --> 700.18]  so keep your eye open for that.
[700.18 --> 703.98]  This morning, I'm going to particularly highlight children's worship time,
[704.32 --> 706.44]  which is going to be starting up in a couple weeks.
[706.96 --> 708.60]  And so if you're able to sign up for that,
[708.66 --> 713.34]  again, you can talk to Pastor Kevin or Rachel Maloaney if she's around somewhere.
[713.68 --> 715.16]  Get plugged in in that regard.
[716.90 --> 723.62]  Next Saturday is also going to have worship at Sunridge Gardens.
[724.00 --> 726.74]  So there's a seniors living facility up the hill
[726.74 --> 730.22]  that we once a month go and lead in worship with them.
[730.88 --> 733.10]  That's beginning again because it's September,
[733.30 --> 735.88]  and so we're going to do that 2 o'clock next Saturday.
[736.08 --> 738.22]  If you're interested in joining, you may go there.
[739.58 --> 741.32]  And two more.
[741.88 --> 742.72]  Yes, two more.
[742.72 --> 746.94]  The backpack campaign is still going on,
[747.26 --> 750.52]  and some people are like, they delivered those backpacks this week.
[750.68 --> 751.74]  Why are we still giving?
[752.18 --> 753.86]  It's because they still have to pay for them.
[754.52 --> 757.06]  And so we've agreed to help them and partner with them
[757.06 --> 761.26]  in supplying the funds for those backpacks that have, yes, been delivered
[761.26 --> 762.96]  because school starts on Tuesday.
[763.60 --> 765.34]  But so that campaign is still happening,
[765.44 --> 768.46]  and so please consider how you might support that and give in that.
[768.46 --> 774.10]  And then lastly, draw your attention to, in October on the 4th,
[774.16 --> 776.96]  we are hosting a worship conference here.
[777.08 --> 778.60]  Information has gone out for that.
[778.94 --> 782.12]  We really want to encourage you to spread that invite around,
[782.56 --> 785.84]  people who you know might be interested in participating
[785.84 --> 788.06]  and coming together to think about
[788.06 --> 790.90]  and to worship through all of our emotions
[790.90 --> 794.80]  and inmost beings and struggles and hardships and joys and celebrations,
[795.02 --> 797.84]  how we might bring that all into the presence of God.
[797.84 --> 800.78]  There's more information for that in the e-bulletins
[800.78 --> 802.24]  and on our church website as well.
[803.04 --> 804.16]  I think that's it.
[804.78 --> 807.16]  If I've missed something, my apologies.
[807.84 --> 809.00]  Let's stand together,
[809.28 --> 812.64]  and we can be ushered into God's presence as we worship Him.
[813.22 --> 816.34]  I'm going to extend to you God's greeting,
[816.60 --> 819.32]  and then I invite you to spread that around,
[819.42 --> 821.62]  to share that around to the people around you
[821.62 --> 823.14]  by passing the peace of Christ
[823.14 --> 824.76]  or by saying the Lord be with you.
[824.76 --> 828.02]  Receive the greeting of our good God this morning.
[829.28 --> 832.72]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you
[832.72 --> 834.02]  from God our Father,
[834.14 --> 836.86]  from the Lord Jesus Christ, Son, and our Savior,
[837.36 --> 840.02]  through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[840.02 --> 841.42]  Amen.
[841.42 --> 841.48]  Amen.
[841.48 --> 841.52]  Amen.
[870.02 --> 885.56]  Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 9, verses 1 and 2.
[885.56 --> 905.98]  Let's sing together of God's love and goodness to us.
[905.98 --> 907.04]  Amen.
[907.04 --> 907.46]  Amen.
[907.46 --> 912.28]  Amen.
[912.32 --> 920.22]  Amen.
[920.28 --> 920.88]  Amen.
[920.96 --> 921.16]  Amen.
[921.46 --> 922.46]  Amen.
[922.46 --> 922.58]  Amen.
[922.58 --> 923.46]  Amen.
[924.02 --> 924.04]  Amen.
[924.08 --> 924.42]  Amen.
[924.42 --> 924.98]  Amen.
[925.12 --> 925.32]  Amen.
[925.32 --> 925.92]  Amen.
[926.00 --> 926.10]  Amen.
[926.10 --> 926.40]  Amen.
[926.40 --> 926.56]  Amen.
[926.56 --> 927.96]  Amen.
[930.14 --> 930.58]  Amen.
[932.38 --> 932.44]  Amen.
[932.44 --> 932.74]  Amen.
[932.86 --> 933.24]  Amen.
[933.32 --> 933.62]  Amen.
[933.62 --> 933.68]  Amen.
[933.70 --> 933.74]  Amen.
[933.84 --> 933.98]  Amen.
[933.98 --> 934.50]  Amen.
[934.50 --> 935.52]  Amen.
[935.52 --> 935.96]  Amen.
[935.96 --> 947.24]  I love you, Lord
[947.24 --> 953.46]  Oh, your mercy never fails me
[953.46 --> 961.72]  All my days I've been held in your hands
[961.72 --> 965.54]  From the moment that I wake up
[965.54 --> 969.64]  Until I lay my head
[969.64 --> 976.98]  I will sing of the goodness of God
[976.98 --> 984.10]  All my life you have been faithful
[984.10 --> 993.92]  All my life you have been so, so good
[993.92 --> 999.24]  The very breath that I am healed
[999.24 --> 1006.66]  I will sing of the goodness of God
[1006.66 --> 1011.36]  I love your voice
[1011.36 --> 1015.98]  You have led me through the fire
[1015.98 --> 1019.58]  In darkest night
[1019.58 --> 1023.48]  You are closer no other
[1023.48 --> 1027.32]  I've known you as a father
[1027.32 --> 1031.92]  I've known you as a friend
[1031.92 --> 1038.74]  I have lived in the goodness of God
[1038.74 --> 1045.92]  All my life you have been faithful
[1045.92 --> 1054.92]  All my life you have been so, so good
[1054.92 --> 1067.74]  I have lived in the goodness of God
[1067.74 --> 1073.74]  Your goodness is running after me
[1073.74 --> 1080.74]  It's running after me
[1080.74 --> 1084.74]  Your goodness is running after me
[1084.74 --> 1086.90]  With my life laid down
[1086.90 --> 1088.84]  Surrender now
[1088.84 --> 1091.56]  I give you everything
[1091.56 --> 1096.56]  Your goodness is running after me
[1096.56 --> 1099.56]  It's running after me
[1099.56 --> 1103.56]  Your goodness is running after me
[1103.56 --> 1107.56]  It's running after me
[1107.56 --> 1111.56]  Your goodness is running after me
[1111.56 --> 1113.56]  It's running after me
[1113.56 --> 1116.50]  With my life laid down
[1116.50 --> 1117.56]  Surrender now
[1117.56 --> 1120.56]  I give you everything
[1120.56 --> 1125.56]  Your goodness is running after me
[1125.56 --> 1126.56]  You're turning after me
[1126.56 --> 1132.56]  You're turning after me
[1132.56 --> 1139.56]  All my life you have been faithful
[1139.56 --> 1149.56]  All my life you have been so, so good
[1149.56 --> 1155.56]  With every breath that I am faithful
[1155.56 --> 1156.56]  I will sing
[1156.56 --> 1158.56]  I will sing
[1158.56 --> 1162.56]  Of the goodness of God
[1162.56 --> 1166.56]  I will sing
[1166.56 --> 1170.56]  Of the goodness of God
[1170.56 --> 1189.56]  You were the word at the beginning
[1189.56 --> 1197.56]  One with God, the Lord all time
[1197.56 --> 1204.56]  Your hidden glory in creation
[1204.56 --> 1210.56]  Now revealed in you are Christ
[1210.56 --> 1214.56]  What a beautiful name it is
[1214.56 --> 1218.56]  What a beautiful name it is
[1218.56 --> 1233.56]  Nothing compares to this
[1233.56 --> 1236.56]  What a beautiful name it is
[1236.56 --> 1237.56]  The name of Jesus
[1237.56 --> 1239.56]  The name of Jesus
[1239.56 --> 1243.56]  The name of Jesus
[1243.56 --> 1251.56]  You didn't want heaven without us
[1251.56 --> 1252.56]  So Jesus
[1252.56 --> 1254.56]  You brought heaven down
[1254.56 --> 1261.56]  You brought heaven down
[1261.56 --> 1264.56]  The sin was great, your love was greater
[1264.56 --> 1265.56]  What a beautiful name it is
[1265.56 --> 1266.56]  What a beautiful name it is
[1266.56 --> 1267.56]  What a beautiful name it is
[1267.56 --> 1279.56]  What a beautiful name it is
[1279.56 --> 1286.56]  The name of Jesus Christ I be
[1286.56 --> 1294.82]  What a wonderful name it is, that it comes to this.
[1294.82 --> 1301.66]  What a wonderful name it is, the name of Jesus.
[1302.26 --> 1308.92]  What a wonderful name it is, the name of Jesus.
[1316.56 --> 1344.84]  Death could not hold you, the veil tore before you.
[1344.84 --> 1351.56]  Silence the bones of sin and grave.
[1352.28 --> 1358.36]  The heavens are roaring, the praise of your glory.
[1359.20 --> 1364.60]  For you are raised to life again.
[1366.18 --> 1372.30]  You have no rival, you have no equal.
[1372.30 --> 1379.24]  Now and forever, God, you reign.
[1380.10 --> 1382.52]  Yours is the kingdom.
[1383.58 --> 1386.06]  Yours is the glory.
[1387.16 --> 1393.26]  Yours is the name above all things.
[1393.26 --> 1396.84]  What a powerful name it is.
[1396.84 --> 1400.34]  What a powerful name it is.
[1400.34 --> 1406.60]  The name of Jesus Christ, my King.
[1407.48 --> 1411.02]  What a powerful name it is.
[1411.70 --> 1414.50]  Nothing can stand the best.
[1414.50 --> 1417.82]  What a powerful name it is.
[1417.82 --> 1421.40]  The name of Jesus.
[1422.30 --> 1424.94]  You have no rival.
[1425.78 --> 1428.52]  You have no evil.
[1428.52 --> 1435.46]  Now and forever, God, you reign.
[1435.46 --> 1438.80]  Yours is the kingdom.
[1439.80 --> 1442.32]  Yours is the glory.
[1443.32 --> 1449.58]  Yours is the name above all things.
[1449.58 --> 1450.58]  What a powerful name it is.
[1450.58 --> 1453.06]  What a powerful name it is.
[1453.06 --> 1456.54]  What a powerful name it is.
[1456.54 --> 1462.80]  The name of Jesus Christ, my King.
[1463.80 --> 1467.40]  What a powerful name it is.
[1467.40 --> 1470.44]  Nothing can stand against.
[1470.44 --> 1473.74]  What a powerful name it is.
[1473.74 --> 1475.74]  The name of Jesus Christ, my King.
[1475.74 --> 1476.74]  What a wonderful name it is.
[1476.74 --> 1480.74]  What a wonderful name it is.
[1480.74 --> 1484.74]  The name of Jesus Christ, my King.
[1484.74 --> 1487.88]  What a beautiful name it is.
[1487.88 --> 1493.74]  The name of Jesus Christ, my King.
[1497.74 --> 1500.98]  In our time of confession and assurance this morning,
[1501.12 --> 1503.42]  we draw on the mystery of our faith.
[1503.74 --> 1507.96]  And a grace and love that cannot be undone by our sin.
[1508.68 --> 1514.26]  We trust in God's mercy and grace alone as we come to him in prayer.
[1514.76 --> 1516.32]  Please join me in prayer.
[1518.24 --> 1522.18]  Holy God, Lord of life, hear our prayer.
[1523.60 --> 1528.54]  Forgive us when we follow our own paths that lead us astray and away from you.
[1529.64 --> 1532.84]  Forgive us when we forget that you offer us life.
[1532.84 --> 1535.68]  Life that is abundant and eternal.
[1535.68 --> 1539.36]  Life that began at the creation of all things.
[1540.42 --> 1543.18]  Forgive us and turn our hearts to you.
[1544.06 --> 1548.92]  May your love and grace flow over us and in this world we live in.
[1549.86 --> 1554.32]  We pray this in the name of Jesus and for his sake alone.
[1554.32 --> 1555.48]  Amen.
[1555.48 --> 1555.52]  Amen.
[1558.90 --> 1559.56]  Amen.

[1578.42 --> 1578.58]  Amen.
[1578.58 --> 1579.12]  Amen.
[1579.12 --> 1579.44]  Amen.

[1581.74 --> 1582.20]  Amen.
[1582.20 --> 1584.04]  Amen.
[1584.04 --> 1606.00]  Amazing grace
[1606.00 --> 1610.84]  How sweet the sound
[1610.84 --> 1620.22]  That saved a wretch like me
[1620.22 --> 1625.72]  I once was lost
[1625.72 --> 1630.28]  But now am found
[1630.28 --> 1637.84]  Was blind but now I see
[1637.84 --> 1649.84]  T'was grace that taught my heart to fear
[1650.40 --> 1656.84]  And grace my fears relieved
[1656.84 --> 1668.84]  How precious did that grace appear
[1668.84 --> 1675.84]  The hour I first believed
[1675.84 --> 1681.84]  My dreams are gone
[1682.36 --> 1684.84]  I've been set free
[1684.84 --> 1687.84]  My God, my Savior
[1688.40 --> 1691.84]  Has ransomed me
[1691.84 --> 1694.84]  And like a flood
[1694.84 --> 1699.84]  His mercy reigns
[1699.84 --> 1702.84]  Unending love
[1702.84 --> 1706.84]  Amazing grace
[1706.84 --> 1723.84]  The Lord has promised good to me
[1723.84 --> 1729.84]  My spirit, my hope secures
[1729.84 --> 1737.84]  He will my shield and portion be
[1737.84 --> 1743.84]  As long as life can do
[1743.84 --> 1748.84]  Through many dangers
[1748.84 --> 1751.84]  Stores and snares
[1751.84 --> 1757.84]  I have already come
[1757.84 --> 1759.84]  His grace
[1759.84 --> 1760.84]  His grace
[1760.84 --> 1761.84]  His grace
[1761.84 --> 1764.84]  Has brought me safe thus far
[1764.84 --> 1766.84]  And grace
[1766.84 --> 1770.84]  Will lead me home
[1770.84 --> 1772.84]  My chains are gone
[1772.84 --> 1774.84]  My chains are gone
[1774.84 --> 1777.84]  I've been set free
[1777.84 --> 1780.84]  My God, my Savior
[1780.84 --> 1782.84]  Has ransomed me
[1782.84 --> 1784.84]  And like a flood
[1784.84 --> 1785.84]  His mercy reigns
[1785.84 --> 1786.84]  And like a flood
[1786.84 --> 1787.84]  His mercy reigns
[1787.84 --> 1791.84]  Unending love
[1791.84 --> 1797.84]  Amazing grace
[1797.84 --> 1814.84]  When we've been there
[1814.84 --> 1818.84]  Ten thousand years
[1818.84 --> 1824.84]  Bright shining as the sun
[1824.84 --> 1827.74]  We've been there
[1827.74 --> 1830.84]  We've known
[1830.84 --> 1833.84]  We've known
[1833.84 --> 1835.84]  We died
[1835.84 --> 1837.84]  We've known
[1837.84 --> 1838.84]  They've known
[1838.84 --> 1839.84]  We've known
[1839.84 --> 1840.84]  The Bridge
[1840.84 --> 1842.84]  Has nor
[1842.84 --> 1843.86]  avoir
[1843.86 --> 1845.84]  Has respite
[1845.84 --> 1848.84]  I've been set free
[1848.84 --> 1850.84]  My God, my Savior
[1850.84 --> 1853.84]  Has ransomed me
[1853.84 --> 1860.16]  And like a flood, His mercy brings.
[1860.60 --> 1867.08]  Unending love, amazing grace.
[1867.08 --> 1873.50]  My chains are gone, I've been set free.
[1874.60 --> 1881.32]  My God, my Savior, has resumed me.
[1881.32 --> 1888.70]  And like a flood, His mercy brings.
[1889.16 --> 1896.54]  Unending love, amazing grace.
[1911.32 --> 1936.48]  Let the King of my heart be the mountain where I run.
[1936.48 --> 1942.92]  The fountain I drink from, oh, He is my song.
[1943.74 --> 1950.32]  Let the King of my heart be the shadow where I hide.
[1950.74 --> 1956.74]  The ransom for my life, oh, He is my song.
[1956.74 --> 1962.74]  You are good, good, oh.
[1964.00 --> 1968.74]  You are good, good, oh.
[1968.74 --> 1975.46]  Oh, you are good, good, oh.
[1976.00 --> 1982.12]  You are good, good, oh.
[1982.12 --> 1994.02]  Let the King of my heart be the wind inside my sails.
[1994.38 --> 2000.12]  The anchor in my waves, oh, He is my song.
[2000.12 --> 2007.38]  Let the King of my heart be the fire inside my days.
[2007.38 --> 2013.38]  The echo of my days, oh, He is my song.
[2013.76 --> 2019.38]  You are good, good, oh.
[2019.38 --> 2025.38]  Oh, you are good, good, oh.
[2026.64 --> 2032.48]  You are good, good, oh.
[2032.48 --> 2039.48]  You are good, good, oh.
[2039.48 --> 2069.46]  You are good, oh, He is my song.
[2069.46 --> 2075.26]  God is holding on to me.
[2076.06 --> 2081.34]  God is holding on.
[2083.84 --> 2085.20]  Let me have a seat.
[2095.70 --> 2096.68]  Good morning.
[2096.68 --> 2103.18]  So a couple of months back in April, we took an offering, as we often do, for Life Water Canada.
[2103.76 --> 2109.50]  And Life Water Canada is a ministry that was introduced to our church by Pastor Bill Verstegg many years ago.
[2109.58 --> 2112.96]  He was involved with them, and so we've been supporting them ever since.
[2113.16 --> 2115.92]  So we have Linda here as a special guest.
[2116.14 --> 2121.10]  She's been traveling across the country in her vehicle and with her kitty, she told me.
[2121.10 --> 2128.30]  She's from Thunder Bay, and she's doing a big tour, just updating churches, sharing stories, and thanking for the support.
[2128.70 --> 2132.68]  So I'm going to ask Linda to join us and share a bit from Life Water Canada.
[2132.68 --> 2143.70]  Well, good morning.
[2143.70 --> 2148.80]  I just wanted to thank you so much for being able to come and share.
[2148.80 --> 2153.20]  I had lots of pictures.
[2153.20 --> 2164.02]  You can see some of them in the banners in the back, and feel free to take a newsletter there that has some more details about what it is that we do.
[2164.02 --> 2182.66]  You know, the bottom line of what motivates us, the passion that we, you know, really stir into a raging flame, is that it is not right that where you're born should determine whether you live or whether you die.
[2183.44 --> 2187.02]  A child here in our nation has a very good chance of survival.
[2187.52 --> 2190.52]  A child overseas, it's not the same story.
[2190.52 --> 2197.40]  Since we don't have pictures, I'm just going to kind of flip into a few stories, which is probably a good thing anyway.
[2198.90 --> 2202.20]  I was in Liberia, West Africa.
[2202.76 --> 2206.08]  You know, that's, you know, if you see Africa there, it's right there on the equator.
[2206.82 --> 2208.66]  I was teaching a health and hygiene workshop.
[2208.78 --> 2216.32]  I had about 20 men and women there, and it was a three-day workshop trying to impart just a little bit of basic knowledge.
[2216.32 --> 2230.76]  Washing hands, how disease was transmitted, how you could stop that transmission of disease that causes diarrhea, which is really the killer of infants, and just diminishes the potential that people can meet because they're chronically ill.
[2231.48 --> 2236.92]  On the third day, I looked at the back row, and there was a lady, an older lady, and she was quietly weeping.
[2236.92 --> 2238.88]  And this is my first trip in Liberia.
[2239.00 --> 2244.36]  I thought, oh, dear, I've stepped on some, you know, kind of tribal toes, and I did say something wrong.
[2244.58 --> 2253.20]  And anyway, I just carried on quietly, and I went home with her daughter, Fatou, and I said, Fatou, like, how come Elizabeth was crying in the workshop?
[2253.20 --> 2263.18]  And she explained to me that in her tribe, the baby was not even given a name until it got to be a month old.
[2263.36 --> 2268.46]  And at that point, they figured it had a good chance of survival, and so they would have a ceremony.
[2268.72 --> 2276.68]  They would name the child, and the grandma or grandpa would come and give them the first drink of water because water is life.
[2276.68 --> 2279.98]  Unfortunately, the water was not life-giving.
[2280.18 --> 2282.12]  It was a teaspoon of death.
[2282.74 --> 2294.98]  And Elizabeth at that point had learned that she had been instrumental in the demise of three of her grandchildren because shortly after that child had given the water, they had perished.
[2296.54 --> 2298.00]  I mean, horrific, right?
[2298.22 --> 2301.94]  I was, I mean, I can't imagine the pain she was feeling.
[2301.94 --> 2311.80]  I went back the next year, and I looked her up and see how she was doing, and she was bubbling over with joy, which was, like, good.
[2312.42 --> 2315.54]  And I said, like, you know, how are you feeling?
[2315.74 --> 2327.12]  And she said, my aunt, or no, my niece, way up country in Lofa, called her and said, my baby, an infant, was very ill, and she didn't know what to do.
[2327.12 --> 2332.68]  But Elizabeth, with those little seeds of knowledge, was able to say, make sure you keep the baby on the breast.
[2332.80 --> 2334.72]  Make sure you give her sterile water.
[2335.02 --> 2344.26]  So boil it for five minutes, and make sure you put a little salt and a little bit of banana or something in it, and that every time that baby had a diarrhea, then give her that.
[2344.62 --> 2346.04]  And that infant lived.
[2346.04 --> 2358.36]  So I was very grateful, you know, that there was fruit, good fruit from the workshop, but ongoing redemptive impact from that little tiny seed of knowledge.
[2359.32 --> 2363.28]  You know, the word says, my people die, perish for lack of knowledge.
[2363.92 --> 2366.86]  And it doesn't have to be, you know, a university degree.
[2367.02 --> 2369.10]  Sometimes it just needs to be a little seed.
[2369.10 --> 2374.98]  Because when kids are sick from contaminated water, they don't get to go to school.
[2375.32 --> 2376.06]  Adults are sick.
[2376.38 --> 2378.48]  They can't earn a living to provide for their families.
[2379.02 --> 2384.72]  You know, unsafe water prevents families, communities, entire regions from really reaching their potential.
[2385.00 --> 2386.78]  Because water is life.
[2387.68 --> 2388.90]  I mean, just take a minute and think.
[2388.98 --> 2390.48]  Where did you use water this morning?
[2391.20 --> 2392.08]  Had a cup of coffee?
[2392.28 --> 2393.00]  Brushed your teeth?
[2393.24 --> 2393.94]  Flushed your toilet?
[2394.94 --> 2396.06]  You know, had a shower?
[2396.06 --> 2398.38]  Like, we use it all the time.
[2398.92 --> 2399.92]  Without thought.
[2400.84 --> 2404.12]  But it is a privilege that we have in this nation.
[2404.32 --> 2405.76]  It is not the same overseas.
[2407.02 --> 2413.20]  The WHO stats, the World Health Organization, they say, you know, over 2 billion people don't have safe water to drink.
[2413.80 --> 2417.48]  And over 3 billion don't have safe sanitation.
[2418.74 --> 2421.16]  You know, the women carry the burden of water.
[2421.68 --> 2425.44]  They're the ones, the children, the women, they'll be walking long distances,
[2425.44 --> 2430.12]  often with a toddler on their back, a toddler on their side, in the dark,
[2430.30 --> 2433.02]  so that they can get to the water before the animals muddy it.
[2433.98 --> 2438.80]  It's exposing them to snakes, dangers, human danger.
[2439.76 --> 2442.90]  And for water, that's bad for them.
[2442.90 --> 2446.54]  And we are doing something impactful.
[2446.76 --> 2452.22]  To this point, we've given over 9.5 million people safe water and sanitation and education.
[2453.28 --> 2460.64]  We have drilled over 3,000 wells, repaired over 17,000 pumps.
[2460.64 --> 2464.64]  We repair everybody's pumps, not just what we put in.
[2464.96 --> 2471.82]  And we will continue to do so and continue to drill to try and keep the number of people on a pump low,
[2472.00 --> 2473.72]  so that that pump will last longer.
[2475.10 --> 2480.60]  We've also initiated a new component to the work that we do,
[2480.60 --> 2483.10]  and that's addressing period poverty.
[2484.24 --> 2488.40]  Girls miss a week of every month from school
[2488.40 --> 2491.40]  because they don't have something simple as sanitary pads.
[2492.02 --> 2495.46]  So a couple of years ago, it came to our attention that this was a factor.
[2495.80 --> 2500.02]  We started a small microenterprise in Kenya, had a bunch of single moms,
[2500.40 --> 2505.32]  because unfortunately, one of the ways that the Kenya women were dealing with this problem
[2505.32 --> 2509.26]  was they were exchanging sex for pads.
[2509.62 --> 2513.16]  And then, of course, you had unplanned pregnancies and infections, etc.
[2513.82 --> 2520.32]  So we've started this program, and we've done some studies since that time.
[2520.40 --> 2521.44]  It's been almost three years.
[2522.34 --> 2525.98]  And on-line pregnancies are none, right?
[2526.08 --> 2527.84]  That's dropped right off the radar.
[2528.48 --> 2531.38]  And Kenya keeps pretty good scores of educational components,
[2531.38 --> 2536.28]  and the girls' scores rose significantly because they were able to attend school
[2536.28 --> 2540.36]  four weeks out of every month, which for them was a privilege.
[2541.00 --> 2542.94]  How many kids are going back to school next week?
[2544.52 --> 2546.34]  Is it a privilege to go to school?
[2547.78 --> 2549.34]  Well, yes and no, right?
[2551.42 --> 2553.20]  But for them, it really is.
[2553.60 --> 2555.60]  We are still working in four nations,
[2556.60 --> 2560.52]  Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria, and in Haiti.
[2560.52 --> 2563.36]  All of these nations are very poor.
[2563.80 --> 2565.42]  They don't really have government support
[2565.42 --> 2570.64]  to be able to provide the water and sanitation on their own.
[2570.86 --> 2574.32]  So we are there to be able to stand alongside and help.
[2576.08 --> 2578.88]  We have multiple teams in each of those nations.
[2581.38 --> 2583.10]  We've been working now 30 years.
[2583.66 --> 2586.44]  And as Mike mentioned, I'm on a journey.
[2586.84 --> 2588.50]  It's called the Journey to 30.
[2588.50 --> 2591.46]  First well was drilled in March of 1995,
[2591.78 --> 2595.88]  and we were incorporated in 1997.
[2596.70 --> 2600.36]  And so I'll be traveling across Canada for the next couple of years just sharing.
[2600.86 --> 2603.88]  It's been just such a delight, at least to me.
[2604.02 --> 2605.10]  I'm not sure about my kitty.
[2605.78 --> 2609.94]  He's presently hiding behind the bed or under the covers.
[2609.94 --> 2621.38]  These 30 years has been, you know, solidly growing.
[2622.66 --> 2624.90]  The nonprofit has been solidly growing.
[2625.10 --> 2628.80]  We're about four times as big as we were in 2020.
[2628.80 --> 2634.18]  And part of that is because of members like yourselves.
[2634.90 --> 2643.28]  You know, I don't know if you realize that this church has provided over $72,000 of support.
[2643.28 --> 2650.98]  You've helped with 30 projects, including the two wells in Kenya that you just sponsored a few months ago.
[2651.78 --> 2654.08]  It is incredibly impactful.
[2654.52 --> 2656.72]  It's making life-changing differences.
[2656.72 --> 2664.50]  And, you know, our teams, they are positioned well to be able to, they're trained, they're equipped,
[2664.74 --> 2671.34]  they go into the local communities, they facilitate ownership and community involvement,
[2672.00 --> 2673.84]  but they can't do it on their own.
[2674.38 --> 2677.98]  You know, if they don't work for the day, their families don't eat.
[2678.48 --> 2682.38]  You know, to be a volunteer is something we're privileged with,
[2682.38 --> 2686.36]  but it's not something that somebody who earns a dollar a day can afford.
[2687.10 --> 2692.62]  And so your sponsorships and your facilitation has really enabled the continuation
[2692.62 --> 2696.86]  and the completeness of the circle to keep that water flowing to those that are in need.
[2700.70 --> 2704.04]  You know, in the early days, it was wartime in Liberia,
[2704.26 --> 2707.00]  and we came back from that trip thinking, you know,
[2707.02 --> 2709.46]  we need to do the easy ones first to reach the most people.
[2709.46 --> 2714.52]  So 30 years later, we're still doing that, but we've progressed a little bit further.
[2714.66 --> 2716.92]  We're trying to make the hard ones easy.
[2717.38 --> 2722.36]  And that means that we are working hard on new technologies and innovations
[2722.36 --> 2725.26]  so that we can get into the hinterlands, into the forgotten places.
[2725.62 --> 2727.30]  A rig requires a good road,
[2727.40 --> 2730.82]  and a lot of the places where the people are living don't have that.
[2731.24 --> 2737.68]  And so we've made an off-roading, kind of very maneuverable, narrow wheelbase truck-mounted rig
[2737.68 --> 2741.50]  that's now in all of our Africa communities.
[2742.14 --> 2747.10]  And on the sea sailing right now is a new adventure.
[2747.36 --> 2749.42]  It's actually a rig on a motorcycle.
[2750.26 --> 2756.76]  Three-wheeled motorcycle, big tires, and the mast folds over the driver.
[2756.76 --> 2761.70]  And it can still drill and rock about 300 feet, which is the max a pump can handle anyway.
[2762.34 --> 2763.52]  We're going to check it out.
[2763.66 --> 2767.50]  It's sailing here to Vancouver and then being shipped by rail to Lethbridge,
[2767.58 --> 2768.44]  where we can test it.
[2768.52 --> 2769.36]  It's made in China.
[2770.12 --> 2771.50]  So we'll see how it is.
[2771.64 --> 2775.40]  But the idea and the innovation is, like, so streamlined
[2775.40 --> 2778.04]  and so in keeping with making the hard ones easy.
[2778.04 --> 2782.24]  And this one will be shipped to Haiti.
[2783.14 --> 2787.24]  And they will start a brand-new drilling team because Haiti right now,
[2787.56 --> 2790.00]  as you may know, is in terrible turmoil.
[2790.16 --> 2791.08]  There is no government.
[2791.84 --> 2795.84]  Our team, because they are all local, are successfully drilling.
[2796.38 --> 2802.28]  I just got 89 repairs and six hand pumps, new wells drilled this month.
[2802.28 --> 2806.96]  So they are quietly under the radar going into where the need is.
[2807.50 --> 2810.30]  This rig will make it very helpful for them.
[2813.14 --> 2817.08]  Again, I wanted to just spend this time just to say thank you.
[2817.76 --> 2819.68]  We're really grateful for your support.
[2820.10 --> 2821.62]  We're really grateful for your prayers.
[2822.26 --> 2825.82]  If you would like, I do a monthly prayer update.
[2825.96 --> 2828.38]  There's a sign-up sheet at the back beside the posters.
[2828.64 --> 2831.86]  We are also hosting what we're calling a town hall.
[2832.28 --> 2834.22]  And so if you want to hear a little bit more, right,
[2834.30 --> 2838.22]  directly from our Nigeria program coordinator,
[2838.36 --> 2841.68]  who happens to be the dean of education and psychology
[2841.68 --> 2843.98]  in the Abuja University and our lead driller.
[2844.40 --> 2845.56]  He is very well-spoken.
[2845.84 --> 2848.44]  He has incredible stories to share of the impact
[2848.44 --> 2850.42]  that his team's been making in Nigeria
[2850.42 --> 2853.40]  and the expansion that he's anticipating to do
[2853.40 --> 2857.40]  to reach not only an Abuja area but down close to Lagos,
[2857.72 --> 2859.88]  very populated areas with nothing.
[2859.88 --> 2863.76]  So please feel free to sign up in the back
[2863.76 --> 2866.64]  and I'll be around there too if you wanted to talk
[2866.64 --> 2867.52]  or ask more questions.
[2867.96 --> 2868.92]  Thank you very much.
[2874.92 --> 2876.24]  Thank you very much, Linda.
[2876.70 --> 2877.96]  Yeah, she'll be at the back
[2877.96 --> 2879.72]  and you can always ask questions or sign up
[2879.72 --> 2880.68]  or hear more from her
[2880.68 --> 2883.00]  and the wonderful work Life Water's been doing.
[2883.54 --> 2884.64]  We're also going to take a moment now
[2884.64 --> 2888.16]  to give our own financial gifts in our offering.
[2888.68 --> 2891.60]  And today's offering is for Cascade Christian Counseling.
[2891.96 --> 2894.40]  So they have offices in Surrey and in Abbotsford,
[2894.90 --> 2896.66]  another ministry we've been supporting for many years.
[2896.82 --> 2898.82]  And what I love about them,
[2898.96 --> 2901.54]  especially in helping people in our own church,
[2901.62 --> 2902.98]  our own community with their mental health,
[2903.06 --> 2906.98]  is they have kind of a stepped way of paying for it.
[2906.98 --> 2909.12]  so they don't turn a lot of people away.
[2909.52 --> 2910.96]  And the donations we give today
[2910.96 --> 2912.06]  helps to support people
[2912.06 --> 2914.40]  who maybe can't afford counseling but could use it.
[2914.52 --> 2917.10]  So thank you so much for giving today.
[2917.10 --> 2917.18]  Thank you.
[2917.18 --> 2917.22]  Thank you.
[2917.22 --> 2918.04]  Thank you.
[2918.04 --> 2918.44]  Thank you.
[2918.44 --> 2919.14]  Thank you.
[2919.14 --> 2919.32]  Thank you.
[2919.32 --> 2919.88]  Thank you.
[2919.88 --> 2920.28]  Thank you.
[2920.28 --> 2928.52]  Thank you.
[2928.52 --> 2958.50]  Thank you.
[2958.52 --> 2988.50]  Thank you.
[2988.52 --> 3018.50]  Thank you.
[3018.52 --> 3019.52]  Thank you.
[3019.52 --> 3020.52]  Thank you.
[3020.52 --> 3048.50]  Thank you.
[3048.52 --> 3050.52]  Thank you.
[3050.52 --> 3051.52]  Thank you.
[3051.52 --> 3053.52]  Thank you.
[3053.52 --> 3064.40]  Thank you, O my Father, for giving us your song.
[3064.40 --> 3075.90]  And leaving your spirit till the work on earth is now.
[3075.90 --> 3088.64]  Thank you, O my Father, for giving us your song.
[3088.64 --> 3100.96]  And leaving your spirit till the work on earth is now.
[3105.90 --> 3110.90]  I would love to invite all of the kids to come forward.
[3110.90 --> 3118.90]  If you are three years old, going into kindergarten, maybe you're a little bit older and you want to come up, we're going to sit by this candle, I guess.
[3118.90 --> 3122.90]  Nice. We'll come sit over here, maybe. How about right over here? Is that a better spot?
[3122.90 --> 3126.90]  Yeah? Yeah, come on up. Come on up.
[3126.90 --> 3130.90]  Feel free. Oh, there's only a few of us today.
[3130.90 --> 3136.90]  How are we doing? We're good. Are we ready for children's worship time?
[3136.90 --> 3142.90]  I know. That's exciting. We're going to pray and then we're going to go children's worship time. Is that a good idea?
[3142.90 --> 3149.90]  Yeah? Well, let's pray, okay? Let's fold our hands and close our eyes and then we'll head on off.
[3149.90 --> 3153.90]  Dear God, thank you so much for this day. Thank you that we could be here in church today.
[3153.90 --> 3157.90]  We could sing worship songs to you and open up the Bible and learn more about you as well.
[3157.90 --> 3161.90]  Be with these kids as they go to children's worship time and us as well as we stay back here.
[3161.90 --> 3165.90]  Help us learn what it means to follow you in your name. Amen.
[3165.90 --> 3168.90]  Now, before we go, though, we have to do the children's blessing, right?
[3168.90 --> 3173.90]  So can we stand up? There's only four of us, so we're going to have to be a little bit loud again.
[3173.90 --> 3176.90]  But we're going to say the Lord be with you to everyone, okay?
[3176.90 --> 3181.90]  So can we do that with our hands? Are we ready? The Lord be with you on three. Ready?
[3181.90 --> 3183.90]  Nice and loud. One, two, three.
[3183.90 --> 3186.90]  Be with you.
[3186.90 --> 3188.90]  And also with you.
[3206.90 --> 3229.90]  Morning. My name is Dick. I am a member here. And it's time to come to our God in prayer. Just a couple of notes.
[3229.90 --> 3237.90]  Marguerite Cool's mother passed away on Friday. That is Rachel Malawani's grandmother.
[3237.90 --> 3246.90]  Her health was declining for quite some time. And she did pass away more quickly than what the family expected.
[3246.90 --> 3258.90]  And we also want to think about people missing loved ones. Most of us, if not all of us, at some time in the last short while, long while, whatever,
[3258.90 --> 3265.90]  have always had to say goodbye to somebody. Sometime it's expected. Lots of times it's not.
[3265.90 --> 3274.90]  I want to think about people dealing with illnesses, pain, shut-ins, etc. And then, of course, you've got school.
[3274.90 --> 3284.90]  I'm sure you're probably sick of hearing that already. I did a little question and answer session with some of my grandkids
[3284.90 --> 3290.90]  and I wanted to know if they were excited to go to school. Well, you can almost guess what the majority said.
[3290.90 --> 3303.90]  But there was some that were very excited. I said, you know, you got to see your friends, learn, because you won't believe this until you're way out of it.
[3303.90 --> 3310.90]  But school was actually pretty neat. I mean, a lot of people didn't work very hard, but they sure had to after school.
[3310.90 --> 3317.90]  So you got real work coming, folks. So enjoy it.
[3317.90 --> 3327.90]  I do want to mention that Kevin Lobert and Nikki have been with us for 16, 17 years, Kevin.
[3327.90 --> 3335.90]  And I have been there the whole time. And some of us have been here since actually this church started.
[3335.90 --> 3345.90]  And of all the pastors and associate pastors, Kevin is among the most humblest.
[3345.90 --> 3350.90]  That's my experience. Maybe he hides it well. I don't know. But that's been my experience.
[3350.90 --> 3363.90]  I've talked to Kevin many times for various number of reasons. And it's always been a very it's been a blessing.
[3363.90 --> 3372.90]  So, Kevin, I want you to know that we have a big deal coming up, a meeting talking about whether we want Kevin to stay or not.
[3372.90 --> 3380.90]  And obviously we want what God wants. And so let's come to God in prayer.
[3380.90 --> 3388.90]  Father, we're in heaven. Lord, thank you. Thank you that we can come here Sunday after Sunday after Sunday.
[3388.90 --> 3395.90]  Lord, most of us, Lord, we pray for the shut-ins right now that can't always join us.
[3395.90 --> 3403.90]  Lord, we pray for people we've had to say or that are dealing with saying goodbye to others.
[3403.90 --> 3412.90]  Lord, and especially those people who, if they miss a spouse, that they now are most of the time alone.
[3412.90 --> 3415.90]  They're not alone because you're there. That's obvious, Lord.
[3415.90 --> 3422.90]  But they've always had somebody side by side, maybe for five, ten, fifty, fifty years sometimes.
[3422.90 --> 3426.90]  Just, Lord, will you touch every single person?
[3426.90 --> 3436.90]  We help the rest of us to reach out because, Lord, we can always think of somebody who's had to deal with the loss of a loved one.
[3436.90 --> 3441.90]  Lord, we pray for kids. Thank you for kids. Thank you for grandkids.
[3441.90 --> 3445.90]  Lord, this coming week is a big week. We pray for teachers.
[3445.90 --> 3448.90]  We pray for anybody who works in the school system, Lord.
[3448.90 --> 3451.90]  We pray for a blessing on each one.
[3451.90 --> 3458.90]  We help the leaders to reach out to each other, to the kids.
[3458.90 --> 3461.90]  Then we pray, Lord, will you be with all those kids?
[3461.90 --> 3466.90]  We pray for transportation. We pray for the busyness of it all, Lord.
[3466.90 --> 3474.90]  But also the blessings. We pray, will you, if we go there, even as a student, Lord, that we reach out to the friends we know
[3474.90 --> 3490.90]  and the friends we want to know and also the lonely ones, Lord, who sometimes are missed in the sidelines or not given proper affection or care.
[3490.90 --> 3495.90]  And we pray, will you help us to reach out as you call us to do?
[3495.90 --> 3502.90]  Lord, we pray for Pastor Chris this morning, Lord, as he brings your word.
[3502.90 --> 3508.90]  Lord, as he shares with us what God has told him to share.
[3508.90 --> 3510.90]  Lord, we pray, will you bless each one of us?
[3510.90 --> 3514.90]  Will you help us also this week as we leave from here?
[3514.90 --> 3522.90]  We pray, will you be with us as we hear about other parts of the world, Lord, and sometimes it's just chaos.
[3522.90 --> 3528.90]  Lord, we help us to be a witness to whoever and wherever we can.
[3528.90 --> 3532.90]  Thank you, Lord, this morning that we heard about some parts of Africa.
[3532.90 --> 3539.90]  And there's so many more Christians, Lord, that we don't know about or we just hear about.
[3539.90 --> 3542.90]  And they don't have it near as good as what we do, Lord.
[3542.90 --> 3545.90]  Thank you for the blessings we do live with.
[3545.90 --> 3548.90]  Help us to share. Help us to be aware of that.
[3548.90 --> 3552.90]  Lord, we pray, will you bless us through your word this morning?
[3552.90 --> 3555.90]  Thank you in Jesus name. Amen.
[3555.90 --> 3581.90]  We are going to end our summer this weekend with the conclusion wrapping up our summer series,
[3581.90 --> 3589.90]  looking at Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew, a series that we've entitled Behold Your King.
[3589.90 --> 3596.90]  Today we're going to finish that looking at the death and resurrection of Jesus.
[3596.90 --> 3604.90]  So I'm going to read from Matthew 28, the first 10 verses, but we are going to kind of refer to that bigger section,
[3604.90 --> 3608.90]  starting in chapter 27 through to the end.
[3608.90 --> 3615.90]  And so as always, encourage you really to have a Bible in front of you, open that up or turn it on if it's a phone that you use for that.
[3615.90 --> 3619.90]  And keep that there so we can refer back throughout.
[3619.90 --> 3624.90]  Let's start by reading the first 10 verses of chapter 28 together.
[3624.90 --> 3636.90]  After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
[3636.90 --> 3646.90]  And there was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it.
[3646.90 --> 3657.90]  His appearance was like lightning and his clothes were white as snow, and the guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.
[3657.90 --> 3666.90]  The angel said to the women, do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
[3666.90 --> 3671.90]  He is not here. He has risen, just as he said.
[3671.90 --> 3679.90]  Come, see the place where he lay, and then go quickly and tell his disciples,
[3679.90 --> 3683.90]  he has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee.
[3683.90 --> 3687.90]  There you will see him. Now I have told you.
[3687.90 --> 3696.90]  So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
[3696.90 --> 3700.90]  And suddenly Jesus met them.
[3700.90 --> 3702.90]  Greetings, he said.
[3702.90 --> 3707.90]  They came to him, clasped his feet and worshipped him.
[3707.90 --> 3711.90]  And then Jesus said, do not be afraid.
[3711.90 --> 3718.90]  Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me.
[3718.90 --> 3720.90]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3720.90 --> 3722.90]  Amen.
[3726.90 --> 3730.90]  Think about the stories that we tell.
[3730.90 --> 3737.90]  Some of the most popular stories throughout the history of civilization, in fact,
[3737.90 --> 3742.90]  have circled around the same kinds of themes.
[3742.90 --> 3751.90]  One common theme in the history of storytelling is death and ideas how to defeat it.
[3752.90 --> 3759.90]  Draw your attention, if you would, to that great literary classic, Harry Potter.
[3760.90 --> 3763.90]  Specifically, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.
[3763.90 --> 3771.90]  Now at its heart, the Harry Potter story is not just about wands or spells or castles and magic.
[3771.90 --> 3775.90]  It's about the deepest human fear.
[3775.90 --> 3777.90]  Death itself.
[3778.90 --> 3782.90]  About loneliness in the face of it, or as a result of it.
[3783.90 --> 3788.90]  If you're familiar with that story, and I know some of you are, and some of you are just opposed, Kevin.
[3788.90 --> 3798.90]  But in that story, the Dark Lord Voldemort, I said his name, spends the whole story running from death.
[3798.90 --> 3799.90]  Right?
[3799.90 --> 3803.90]  He grasps after every dark power in order to avoid it.
[3803.90 --> 3811.90]  He splits his soul into horcruxes in an attempt to stave off the inevitability of it.
[3811.90 --> 3818.90]  He's obsessed with defeating death, and his obsession turns him into something less than human.
[3818.90 --> 3822.90]  And it becomes, in the end, a shell of a man.
[3823.90 --> 3828.90]  Powerful, sure, but enslaved by his fear of it.
[3829.90 --> 3838.90]  Now Harry, the protagonist, by contrast, triumphs in this story not by avoiding death, but actually by willingly going to face it.
[3838.90 --> 3846.90]  At the climax of the story, he walks into the forest, unarmed, and he offers himself for his friends.
[3847.90 --> 3854.90]  And in a twist that, if anyone has read the Bible before reading Harry Potter, they knew was coming,
[3854.90 --> 3863.90]  a twist that represents something much deeper than fantasy, he wins not by running from death, but by passing through it.
[3863.90 --> 3870.90]  In fact, his passing through death happens at the King's Cross, even, in the story.
[3870.90 --> 3879.90]  And what makes the story ring true for so many millions of us who have read it is not its clever plot,
[3879.90 --> 3890.90]  but that it touches on something that we all know and long for deep down, that somehow death does not have the last word.
[3890.90 --> 3896.90]  Now, of course, the author, J.K. Rowling, didn't invent this theme.
[3896.90 --> 3901.90]  Like we said, this has been storytelling forever, right?
[3901.90 --> 3907.90]  And it taps into something older and deeper, a truth embedded in every human heart.
[3907.90 --> 3914.90]  J.R.R. Tolkien, who wrote Lord of the Rings and who was inspirational to Rowling,
[3914.90 --> 3922.90]  Tolkien once wrote that the story of Jesus' resurrection is the eucatastrophe of the story of mankind,
[3922.90 --> 3926.90]  the happy ending that breaks into the tragedy.
[3926.90 --> 3933.90]  Tolkien loved to say, actually, that in Christ's resurrection, and C.S. Lewis echoes this too,
[3933.90 --> 3938.90]  everything sad is going to come untrue.
[3938.90 --> 3941.90]  And that's what we long for, right?
[3941.90 --> 3948.90]  Not just to delay death with medicine or technology or strange ideas of transhumanism,
[3948.90 --> 3955.90]  not just to distract ourselves from the shadow of mortality with busyness or with entertainment.
[3955.90 --> 3959.90]  We long for a victory over death itself.
[3959.90 --> 3964.90]  We long for the day when sadness will come undone.
[3964.90 --> 3968.90]  And here's the thing, right?
[3968.90 --> 3972.90]  This longing is not just in them out there.
[3972.90 --> 3977.90]  It's not just in fantasy novels or in philosophers debating the meaning of life.
[3977.90 --> 3980.90]  This longing is in us.
[3980.90 --> 3986.90]  It's in the way we avoid talking about death in polite conversation.
[3986.90 --> 3994.90]  It's in the way we throw everything of ourselves into diets or fitness routines or health trends
[3994.90 --> 4000.90]  just to stave off that feeling of inevitability.
[4000.90 --> 4004.90]  It's in the tears we shed at funerals.
[4004.90 --> 4007.90]  Even when the person lived a long life and a full life, right?
[4007.90 --> 4009.90]  Death feels wrong.
[4009.90 --> 4011.90]  It feels like an intruder.
[4011.90 --> 4014.90]  It feels like something that shouldn't be there.
[4014.90 --> 4019.90]  And again, contemporary philosophers and medical professionals can tell us it's natural.
[4019.90 --> 4024.90]  Biologists can remind us that it's just part of the circle of life.
[4024.90 --> 4027.90]  But our hearts know better in that moment, right?
[4027.90 --> 4030.90]  We don't just want a circle that goes round and round and round.
[4030.90 --> 4032.90]  We want a victory.
[4032.90 --> 4036.90]  We want an end to the pain and to the struggle and the hardship.
[4036.90 --> 4039.90]  We don't want a story that ends in darkness.
[4039.90 --> 4042.90]  We want a story that ends in light.
[4042.90 --> 4045.90]  This longing is universal.
[4045.90 --> 4047.90]  This longing is ancient.
[4047.90 --> 4050.90]  This longing is human.
[4050.90 --> 4057.90]  And that's exactly what the Gospel of Jesus addresses.
[4057.90 --> 4063.90]  The Bible never asks us to pretend that death is fine or that it's merely a natural step.
[4063.90 --> 4067.90]  The Bible refers to death as the last enemy.
[4067.90 --> 4078.90]  And yet, the Bible proclaims that in the death and resurrection of Jesus, death itself has been swallowed up in victory.
[4078.90 --> 4081.90]  That's what Matthew 28 is all about.
[4081.90 --> 4082.90]  Right?
[4082.90 --> 4087.90]  The women come to the tomb expecting death to have the last word.
[4087.90 --> 4090.90]  And instead, they meet a risen Christ.
[4090.90 --> 4095.90]  And in that moment, God stands there boldly before them and declares to the world,
[4095.90 --> 4098.90]  The ache is answered.
[4098.90 --> 4101.90]  The longing is fulfilled.
[4101.90 --> 4107.90]  Victory comes to you through the cross of Jesus.
[4107.90 --> 4122.90]  Our big idea this morning is just that, that the death and the resurrection of Jesus secure our salvation and then together send us out on mission.
[4122.90 --> 4126.90]  The death and resurrection of Jesus secure our salvation and send us out on mission.
[4126.90 --> 4128.90]  Now, I get it.
[4128.90 --> 4132.90]  From the outside, the crucifixion of Jesus looks like a failure.
[4132.90 --> 4133.90]  Right?
[4133.90 --> 4142.90]  A man who healed the sick, who calmed storms, who even raised the dead, is now powerless and mocked and dying on a Roman cross.
[4142.90 --> 4149.90]  There's a sign that hangs above his head that says, this is Jesus, the King of the Jews, and it's meant to ridicule him.
[4149.90 --> 4154.90]  The soldiers, scoffing, divide his clothes.
[4154.90 --> 4158.90]  The leaders sneer at him and his disciples scatter.
[4158.90 --> 4165.90]  To all appearances, in that moment, the cross is defeat.
[4165.90 --> 4168.90]  Death wins.
[4168.90 --> 4173.90]  But Matthew's gospel insists otherwise.
[4173.90 --> 4179.90]  The cross, it turns out, isn't defeat, but it's the very path to victory.
[4179.90 --> 4183.90]  And already in Matthew, we've seen this.
[4183.90 --> 4193.90]  Back in Matthew 16, verse 21, right after Peter confesses that Jesus is the Messiah, this is what Matthew records.
[4193.90 --> 4194.90]  He says,
[4194.90 --> 4213.90]  Notice the word there, right?
[4213.90 --> 4215.90]  It says, must.
[4215.90 --> 4220.90]  Jesus didn't say this might happen or that it was one possibility among others.
[4220.90 --> 4223.90]  He said it must happen.
[4223.90 --> 4227.90]  Again, in Matthew 20, verse 28, we read, Jesus declaring,
[4227.90 --> 4235.90]  The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many.
[4235.90 --> 4238.90]  Again, this was his mission, right?
[4238.90 --> 4242.90]  His death is not accidental, but intentional.
[4242.90 --> 4246.90]  It's not incidental, but essential.
[4246.90 --> 4248.90]  Why?
[4248.90 --> 4251.90]  Why is the cross necessary?
[4251.90 --> 4253.90]  That's the question at the heart of this, right?
[4253.90 --> 4258.90]  Couldn't God have just saved some other way?
[4258.90 --> 4267.90]  Interestingly, this is exactly the question that Anselm of Canterbury wrestled with almost a thousand years ago in his great work,
[4267.90 --> 4272.90]  Cordaeus Homo, why God became man.
[4272.90 --> 4277.90]  If you've been listening to our podcast this summer, you've heard of this individual.
[4277.90 --> 4279.90]  And he asked,
[4279.90 --> 4289.90]  If God is almighty, why could he not simply forgive by his word, without the humiliation of the incarnation or without the agony of the cross?
[4289.90 --> 4296.90]  And his answer is profound and continues to be profound for us today.
[4296.90 --> 4303.90]  The truth is, sin is not something that can simply be waved away.
[4303.90 --> 4309.90]  Sin is a debt of honor owed to God.
[4309.90 --> 4313.90]  An offense against his infinite majesty.
[4313.90 --> 4324.90]  And an offense against an infinite majesty cannot be paid by a finite human, a finite reality.
[4324.90 --> 4327.90]  A substitute is necessary.
[4327.90 --> 4344.90]  One who is truly human, that is one who ought to pay the penalty to stand in our place, but also one who is truly divine, who is fully God, so that he is himself of infinite worth to fill up that glory gap that we have taken.
[4344.90 --> 4352.90]  In other words, only Jesus Christ, who is fully God and fully man, could make this satisfaction for us.
[4352.90 --> 4364.90]  And so, Anselm concludes that the incarnation and the cross are not an arbitrary thing, but the only fitting way to make salvation.
[4364.90 --> 4371.90]  They are, given who God is and who we are, the only way salvation could be secured.
[4371.90 --> 4376.90]  And again, hear this, right?
[4376.90 --> 4379.90]  This isn't just theology on a page.
[4379.90 --> 4384.90]  Matthew shows us this same truth in the garden of Gethsemane.
[4384.90 --> 4390.90]  When Peter reaches for his sword in Gethsemane, Jesus stops him and he says,
[4390.90 --> 4401.90]  Do you think I cannot call on my Father and that at once he will put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels?
[4401.90 --> 4402.90]  And then he says,
[4402.90 --> 4411.90]  But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen this way?
[4411.90 --> 4415.90]  It's Matthew 26, starting at verse 53.
[4415.90 --> 4416.90]  Right?
[4416.90 --> 4418.90]  Jesus could have avoided the cross.
[4418.90 --> 4428.90]  He could have summoned angel armies, but then God's justice would be unsatisfied.
[4428.90 --> 4431.90]  And God's word would be unfulfilled.
[4431.90 --> 4435.90]  And God's covenant would be unkept.
[4435.90 --> 4437.90]  His promise would be broken.
[4437.90 --> 4445.90]  And at the same time, right, we read that the cross was not only necessary, but that it's also chosen.
[4445.90 --> 4446.90]  Right?
[4446.90 --> 4449.90]  In that same garden in Gethsemane, Jesus prays,
[4449.90 --> 4457.90]  My Father, if it's possible, take this cup from me, yet not as I will, but as you will.
[4457.90 --> 4458.90]  Right?
[4458.90 --> 4460.90]  Jesus chooses the will of his Father.
[4460.90 --> 4464.90]  He willingly chooses the cross.
[4464.90 --> 4465.90]  Right?
[4465.90 --> 4466.90]  Right?
[4466.90 --> 4467.90]  Here's the mystery of what's going on here.
[4467.90 --> 4474.90]  That necessity and choice are perfectly bound together in the person of Jesus.
[4474.90 --> 4480.90]  It had to be this way, and Jesus willingly walked this way.
[4480.90 --> 4485.90]  Out of a love for his Father and for us.
[4485.90 --> 4489.90]  This is why the covenant of redemption matters.
[4489.90 --> 4490.90]  Right?
[4490.90 --> 4495.90]  From before the foundation of the world, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit covenanted together.
[4495.90 --> 4500.90]  They made a promise together to save the people that they would create.
[4500.90 --> 4503.90]  And the Father sends, and the Son obeys, and the Spirit applies.
[4503.90 --> 4504.90]  Right?
[4504.90 --> 4506.90]  The cross is not an accident of history.
[4506.90 --> 4515.90]  It's the eternal plan of God, carried out in time and space for you and for me to his glory.
[4515.90 --> 4518.90]  And so when Jesus, on that cross, cries out,
[4518.90 --> 4521.90]  My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[4521.90 --> 4534.90]  He's not lost in despair so much as he is fulfilling the promise of Psalm 22, identifying himself with the righteous sufferer whose vindication is certain.
[4534.90 --> 4545.90]  When he breathes his last in Matthew 27, 50, he does so not in defeat, but in triumph, completing the mission that the Father has given him.
[4545.90 --> 4551.90]  And so again, here in this, right, not just theology, but a real pastoral comfort.
[4551.90 --> 4552.90]  Right?
[4552.90 --> 4556.90]  Your salvation doesn't rest on chance.
[4556.90 --> 4559.90]  It doesn't rest on your strength.
[4559.90 --> 4562.90]  It doesn't even rest on your faith being strong enough.
[4562.90 --> 4571.90]  It rests on what Jesus said must happen, and it rests on his choice to walk that road to the cross.
[4571.90 --> 4577.90]  The cross was necessary, but it was also freely embraced by Jesus.
[4577.90 --> 4584.90]  And that means your salvation is both secure and personal.
[4584.90 --> 4585.90]  Right?
[4585.90 --> 4592.90]  It's necessary so it cannot fail, and it's chosen so it's done in love.
[4592.90 --> 4599.90]  The justice of God demands it, and the love of Christ supplies it.
[4599.90 --> 4600.90]  Right?
[4600.90 --> 4608.90]  Which means that the cross, right, is not defeat, but actually the cross is the deepest victory of God.
[4608.90 --> 4615.90]  God's justice is satisfied, His mercy is poured out, and His people are saved.
[4615.90 --> 4624.90]  If the cross then was necessary, the resurrection is indispensable.
[4624.90 --> 4625.90]  Right?
[4625.90 --> 4629.90]  Without the resurrection, the cross would remain a tragedy.
[4629.90 --> 4633.90]  It would be noble, but ultimately a failure.
[4633.90 --> 4640.90]  But with the resurrection, with the resurrection, right, the cross is revealed as God's victory.
[4640.90 --> 4644.90]  As Paul puts it in Romans 4, he says,
[4644.90 --> 4651.90]  Jesus was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification.
[4651.90 --> 4654.90]  The two must go together.
[4654.90 --> 4658.90]  And Matthew's Gospel has made this plain over and over again.
[4658.90 --> 4675.90]  And here too, at the end of chapter 27, Pilate grants the request of the chief priests and the Pharisees to secure the tomb, to seal the stone, and to set a guard in front of it.
[4675.90 --> 4679.90]  Now this detail isn't incidental.
[4679.90 --> 4680.90]  Right?
[4680.90 --> 4685.90]  It underscores just how final death was supposed to be.
[4685.90 --> 4686.90]  Right?
[4686.90 --> 4692.90]  Human power and authority did everything to make sure that Jesus stayed in that grave.
[4692.90 --> 4700.90]  The stone, the seal, the soldiers, they're symbols in this story of death's dominion, of death's reign.
[4700.90 --> 4704.90]  And then, and then chapter 28 happens.
[4704.90 --> 4705.90]  Right?
[4705.90 --> 4709.90]  Chapter 28 breaks in with a holy disruption.
[4709.90 --> 4716.90]  We read that after the Sabbath at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look for the tomb.
[4716.90 --> 4725.90]  There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven, going to the tomb, rolled back, sat on the stone.
[4725.90 --> 4726.90]  Right?
[4726.90 --> 4733.90]  That angel sitting casually on the stone is almost there mocking death's supposed strength.
[4733.90 --> 4734.90]  Right?
[4734.90 --> 4738.90]  What the Romans have sealed, heaven has unsealed.
[4738.90 --> 4744.90]  What the guards have tried to enforce, God overthrows.
[4744.90 --> 4751.90]  Now, I get it that this sounds like fantasy to some of us.
[4751.90 --> 4754.90]  Just like Harry Potter, maybe.
[4754.90 --> 4757.90]  Maybe some of you are thinking, you know, that's beautiful.
[4757.90 --> 4758.90]  That sounds good.
[4758.90 --> 4759.90]  But is it true?
[4759.90 --> 4761.90]  Is this real?
[4761.90 --> 4762.90]  Right?
[4762.90 --> 4770.90]  After all, saying that death has been defeated is the most audacious claim that Christians make.
[4770.90 --> 4771.90]  Right?
[4771.90 --> 4774.90]  How can we know that this really happened?
[4774.90 --> 4776.90]  How can we know that this is real?
[4776.90 --> 4783.90]  Because every single one of us here has experienced death.
[4783.90 --> 4789.90]  But I don't know if any of us have experienced resurrection after death.
[4789.90 --> 4793.90]  Now, Matthew anticipates this question.
[4793.90 --> 4794.90]  Right?
[4794.90 --> 4797.90]  Notice in verse 11 through 15 of chapter 28.
[4797.90 --> 4798.90]  We didn't read it, but it's there.
[4798.90 --> 4800.90]  The very next verse is after our text.
[4800.90 --> 4807.90]  The guards are bribed in order to spread the story that the disciples stole the body.
[4807.90 --> 4808.90]  Right?
[4808.90 --> 4815.90]  In other words, Matthew is acknowledging that from the very beginning, people tried to explain away the resurrection story.
[4815.90 --> 4820.90]  And yet, the story of Jesus' resurrection cannot be silenced.
[4820.90 --> 4823.90]  And there's at least three reasons why.
[4823.90 --> 4826.90]  And we could go into more and we could go into deeper, but I will hit these quickly.
[4826.90 --> 4828.90]  We could talk more after.
[4828.90 --> 4835.90]  First of all, one of the ways we know this story to be true is because the witnesses were unlikely.
[4835.90 --> 4837.90]  The witnesses were unlikely.
[4837.90 --> 4842.90]  So, Matthew 28 says that the first eyewitnesses were women.
[4842.90 --> 4847.90]  Now, in that culture, their testimony was not even admissible in court.
[4847.90 --> 4848.90]  Right?
[4848.90 --> 4859.90]  In that culture, if you were inventing a story, you wouldn't make women the first eyewitnesses to that story.
[4859.90 --> 4861.90]  Because nobody would believe it.
[4861.90 --> 4870.90]  And so, the only reason to tell the story this way and to include these women as the first eyewitnesses is that that's actually what happened.
[4870.90 --> 4874.90]  And they're refusing to lie about it in order to strengthen the integrity of the claim.
[4874.90 --> 4876.90]  It's like, no, this is real.
[4876.90 --> 4878.90]  This happened this way.
[4878.90 --> 4887.90]  Another reason why we can know this to be true is we can look at how the disciples themselves and their lives are transformed.
[4887.90 --> 4888.90]  Right?
[4888.90 --> 4901.90]  These men went from frightened deserters in Matthew 26 to bold witnesses for Christ who, each one of them, were willing to die for their testimony.
[4901.90 --> 4909.90]  Now, people will die for lies that they believe to be true.
[4909.90 --> 4916.90]  But no one will die for a lie that they know to be a lie.
[4916.90 --> 4917.90]  Right?
[4917.90 --> 4921.90]  Their courage of the disciples to face death in the manner that many of them do.
[4921.90 --> 4924.90]  Peter himself, also crucified, but upside down.
[4924.90 --> 4925.90]  Right?
[4925.90 --> 4934.90]  The only way that that begins to make sense, the only way that we can understand their courage, is if they really saw a risen Jesus.
[4934.90 --> 4937.90]  And that changed everything for them.
[4937.90 --> 4948.90]  And then the third reason why, the movement of early Christianity gained nothing by telling this story.
[4948.90 --> 4951.90]  In fact, they only gained persecution.
[4951.90 --> 4952.90]  Right?
[4952.90 --> 4959.90]  In an ancient world like this one, Christians had no cultural power to protect.
[4959.90 --> 4962.90]  They had no status to lay hold of.
[4962.90 --> 4968.90]  And claiming that a crucified Jew had risen from the dead didn't earn them any influence.
[4968.90 --> 4970.90]  Didn't earn them any status.
[4970.90 --> 4974.90]  The only thing it earned them, like we said, was hostility.
[4974.90 --> 4984.90]  And if they were going to fabricate a story in order to secure their position of influence in society, this story would be the worst one to do.
[4984.90 --> 4986.90]  Doesn't make sense.
[4986.90 --> 4990.90]  And so, is it credible to believe in the resurrection?
[4990.90 --> 4991.90]  Yes!
[4991.90 --> 4993.90]  Absolutely it is!
[4993.90 --> 4995.90]  But more than credible, right?
[4995.90 --> 4997.90]  It's satisfying.
[4997.90 --> 5000.90]  It's existentially satisfying.
[5000.90 --> 5005.90]  Look, it's not just that Christianity and that the resurrection is true.
[5005.90 --> 5006.90]  Right?
[5006.90 --> 5011.90]  It's that Christianity is true, good, and beautiful.
[5011.90 --> 5012.90]  Right?
[5012.90 --> 5019.90]  If Jesus rose, then the deepest longings of the human heart, the longings for meaning and for justice,
[5019.90 --> 5026.90]  the longings for a love that is stronger than death, if Jesus rose, these things aren't illusions, they're fulfilled.
[5026.90 --> 5034.90]  Which means, then, that believing in the resurrection is not just wishful thinking.
[5034.90 --> 5043.90]  It's actually the most reasonable, most hopeful conclusion to the evidence that we see and to the ache that we feel.
[5043.90 --> 5050.90]  But again, Matthew is not just writing a defense here.
[5050.90 --> 5056.90]  He's not just putting a brief together in order to stand in the courtroom of your judgment about this matter.
[5056.90 --> 5059.90]  He is proclaiming good news.
[5059.90 --> 5063.90]  And the angel's words that we read are at the heart of it.
[5063.90 --> 5064.90]  Right?
[5064.90 --> 5073.90]  The angel announces to them, do not be afraid, he says, for I know that you are looking for Jesus.
[5073.90 --> 5075.90]  Jesus who was crucified.
[5075.90 --> 5076.90]  He is not here.
[5076.90 --> 5079.90]  He has risen just as he said.
[5079.90 --> 5082.90]  Come and see the place where he lay.
[5082.90 --> 5084.90]  Now, notice, again, the order.
[5084.90 --> 5088.90]  Jesus who was crucified, he has risen.
[5088.90 --> 5089.90]  Right?
[5089.90 --> 5094.90]  Matthew is binding the cross and resurrection together.
[5094.90 --> 5098.90]  Salvation doesn't come through one without the other.
[5098.90 --> 5103.90]  Jesus crucified without resurrection would mean payment without vindication.
[5103.90 --> 5109.90]  Jesus resurrected without crucifixion would mean triumph without atonement.
[5109.90 --> 5118.90]  But the two together, death and resurrection, mean that sin has been paid for and death itself has been defeated.
[5118.90 --> 5123.90]  And this is where, and these words are beautiful and true.
[5123.90 --> 5130.90]  They're from Peter Chrysologos, who's a fifth century church father, pastor.
[5130.90 --> 5133.90]  He was known for his eloquence in preaching.
[5133.90 --> 5138.90]  And he says, the order of things has changed.
[5138.90 --> 5142.90]  The tomb devours death and not the dead.
[5142.90 --> 5147.90]  The house of death becomes the mansion of life.
[5147.90 --> 5152.90]  The resurrection is the great reversal.
[5152.90 --> 5156.90]  The place of death has become the place of life.
[5156.90 --> 5165.90]  The very thing that swallowed up humanity from Adam onward is itself swallowed up by Christ.
[5165.90 --> 5166.90]  Okay.
[5168.90 --> 5169.90]  See it this way.
[5169.90 --> 5179.90]  In the Old Testament, and when you read the Old Testament, for a Jewish person to touch a corpse made you unclean.
[5179.90 --> 5180.90]  Right?
[5180.90 --> 5184.90]  Death contaminated everything it touched.
[5184.90 --> 5195.90]  But Jesus, Jesus is so holy, so full of divine life, that when he touches death, it's death itself that becomes cleansed.
[5195.90 --> 5196.90]  Right?
[5196.90 --> 5199.90]  The uncleanness of death doesn't reach into him and touch him.
[5199.90 --> 5203.90]  His perfect cleanliness reaches out and swallows up death.
[5203.90 --> 5204.90]  Death doesn't stain him.
[5204.90 --> 5206.90]  He sanctifies death.
[5206.90 --> 5211.90]  Death is swallowed up, not by its own power, but by his holiness.
[5211.90 --> 5212.90]  Right?
[5212.90 --> 5221.90]  That's why the Apostle Paul can exclaim in 1 Corinthians 15, these beautiful words where he shouts, death has been swallowed up in victory.
[5222.90 --> 5223.90]  Where, O death, is your victory?
[5223.90 --> 5225.90]  Where, O death, is your sting?
[5226.90 --> 5227.90]  Right?
[5227.90 --> 5233.90]  Matthew wants us to see that the resurrection transforms everything, even death.
[5233.90 --> 5234.90]  Right?
[5234.90 --> 5235.90]  Right?
[5235.90 --> 5237.90]  That's why he repeats that phrase, do not be afraid.
[5237.90 --> 5238.90]  Right?
[5238.90 --> 5247.90]  The resurrection means that the deepest human longing, the deepest human fear, death itself, no longer has that last word.
[5247.90 --> 5248.90]  Right?
[5248.90 --> 5250.90]  That final enemy is defeated.
[5250.90 --> 5254.90]  The worst thing that could ever happen has already happened in Christ.
[5254.90 --> 5255.90]  We died with him.
[5255.90 --> 5260.90]  And the best thing that could ever happen and will ever happen has already begun.
[5260.90 --> 5262.90]  We are raised with him.
[5263.90 --> 5267.90]  And think then how this answers our deepest ache.
[5267.90 --> 5268.90]  Right?
[5268.90 --> 5271.90]  This longing for victory over death.
[5271.90 --> 5272.90]  Right?
[5272.90 --> 5277.90]  The very thing that we try to distract ourselves from, to delay and to redefine.
[5277.90 --> 5279.90]  But only Jesus defeats it.
[5280.90 --> 5283.90]  Only Jesus steps into it and emerges victorious.
[5283.90 --> 5288.90]  Only Jesus transformed the tomb into the doorway of life.
[5289.90 --> 5293.90]  And again, this isn't abstract.
[5294.90 --> 5296.90]  This is deeply personal.
[5296.90 --> 5301.90]  The resurrection isn't just an event to admire.
[5301.90 --> 5304.90]  It's a reality that we share in.
[5304.90 --> 5307.90]  The Apostle Paul, again, in Colossians 3, says,
[5307.90 --> 5311.90]  Since then you have been raised with Christ.
[5311.90 --> 5316.90]  Set your hearts on things above where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.
[5317.90 --> 5318.90]  Right?
[5318.90 --> 5323.90]  Already now, in union with him, you are raised.
[5323.90 --> 5326.90]  Already, his life is yours.
[5326.90 --> 5333.90]  And that means, when you stand at the grave of someone you love.
[5333.90 --> 5338.90]  When you feel the decline of your own body.
[5338.90 --> 5344.90]  When you live in a moment of pain to pain to pain.
[5344.90 --> 5349.90]  When you are haunted by the shadow of mortality.
[5349.90 --> 5352.90]  You don't stand there alone.
[5352.90 --> 5355.90]  Jesus has gone before you.
[5355.90 --> 5359.90]  And he has turned the house of death into the mansion of life.
[5359.90 --> 5360.90]  Right?
[5360.90 --> 5363.90]  And the angel's command is still God's word to you.
[5363.90 --> 5365.90]  Do not be afraid.
[5365.90 --> 5366.90]  Right?
[5366.90 --> 5368.90]  Because Christ has risen.
[5368.90 --> 5370.90]  The last enemy is defeated.
[5370.90 --> 5375.90]  And the greatest hope that you could ever know and long for is secure in him.
[5375.90 --> 5380.90]  And if the resurrection is true, and boy, do I believe it is.
[5380.90 --> 5383.90]  If the resurrection is true, then what's next?
[5385.90 --> 5388.90]  If the resurrection is true, that can't remain a private thing.
[5388.90 --> 5395.90]  You can't just sit there like you are right now, honestly, passively, receiving this news going, hmm, yeah, okay.
[5395.90 --> 5397.90]  That's what he says every week.
[5397.90 --> 5399.90]  This has to be a public message.
[5399.90 --> 5400.90]  Right?
[5400.90 --> 5401.90]  Notice the angel's message.
[5401.90 --> 5404.90]  He says, go quickly and tell the disciples.
[5404.90 --> 5407.90]  Again, when Jesus meets them, he says, do not be afraid.
[5407.90 --> 5411.90]  Go tell my brothers to go to Galilee where they will see me.
[5411.90 --> 5419.90]  From the very first moment on that very first resurrection Sunday, resurrection faith has to become resurrection witness.
[5419.90 --> 5422.90]  And this message doesn't stop with the disciples.
[5422.90 --> 5433.90]  Right at the end of Matthew's Gospel, these last few words, Jesus now speaks the Great Commission, not only to them, but through them to each of us.
[5433.90 --> 5443.90]  All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me, therefore go and make disciples of all nations.
[5443.90 --> 5444.90]  Right?
[5444.90 --> 5446.90]  There is a clear logic here.
[5446.90 --> 5456.90]  Because Jesus is risen, because death and sin are conquered, because he reigns with all authority, therefore go.
[5456.90 --> 5457.90]  Right?
[5457.90 --> 5460.90]  The Gospel is not only the good news that your sins are forgiven.
[5460.90 --> 5465.90]  It's the good news that the entire cosmos is being remade.
[5465.90 --> 5466.90]  Right?
[5466.90 --> 5481.90]  Again, Paul in Colossians says that through Christ's blood shed on the cross, God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood.
[5481.90 --> 5482.90]  Right?
[5482.90 --> 5486.90]  The victory of God in Christ doesn't just stop with your heart.
[5486.90 --> 5489.90]  It stretches to the whole of creation.
[5489.90 --> 5490.90]  Right?
[5490.90 --> 5494.90]  The substitutionary death of Jesus secures cosmic renewal.
[5494.90 --> 5499.90]  And his resurrection is not just your hope for life after death.
[5499.90 --> 5502.90]  It's creation's hope for restoration.
[5502.90 --> 5509.90]  As Paul says in Romans 8, the whole creation is groaning, waiting for its liberation from decay.
[5509.90 --> 5516.90]  Resurrection Sunday is the dawn of that liberation.
[5516.90 --> 5519.90]  This is the moment we live in now.
[5519.90 --> 5521.90]  And that's huge.
[5521.90 --> 5522.90]  That's cosmic.
[5522.90 --> 5524.90]  That's eternal.
[5524.90 --> 5525.90]  That's world shaking.
[5525.90 --> 5530.90]  But it also comes close.
[5530.90 --> 5535.90]  Down to earth in the ordinary details of our lives together.
[5535.90 --> 5538.90]  Picture this.
[5538.90 --> 5541.90]  Imagine you are planting a garden.
[5541.90 --> 5542.90]  You're kneeling in the dirt.
[5542.90 --> 5545.90]  You're pressing seeds into the soil.
[5545.90 --> 5548.90]  And for a while, it looks like nothing.
[5548.90 --> 5552.90]  And for a while longer, it looks like nothing.
[5552.90 --> 5557.90]  And for a little while longer yet, it looks like nothing, especially if I'm gardening.
[5557.90 --> 5564.90]  But then, one day, in spite of myself and all my lack of effort, something breaks through.
[5564.90 --> 5565.90]  Right?
[5565.90 --> 5570.90]  That small green shoot that pops through is proof that winter is not forever.
[5570.90 --> 5571.90]  Right?
[5571.90 --> 5572.90]  That's what the resurrection is.
[5572.90 --> 5573.90]  Right?
[5573.90 --> 5578.90]  The first green shoot of new creation breaking through into the soil of a dying world.
[5578.90 --> 5584.90]  And whether you water the plants or whether you care for creation or whether you reconcile
[5584.90 --> 5589.90]  with a friend or restore a relationship to your parents, whether you share the gospel
[5589.90 --> 5594.90]  with your neighbor, whenever you do these things, you are participating in the cosmic renewal
[5594.90 --> 5597.90]  that began at the empty tomb.
[5597.90 --> 5601.90]  Because Jesus is risen, you must go and tell.
[5601.90 --> 5608.90]  Because Jesus is risen, you must live and love as those who belong to this world of new creation.
[5608.90 --> 5613.90]  And this, then, is how it's all fitting together.
[5613.90 --> 5614.90]  Right?
[5614.90 --> 5619.90]  Our deepest longing is victory over death.
[5619.90 --> 5623.90]  And what we begin to see is the cross is necessary for that.
[5623.90 --> 5629.90]  Not an accident, but the only way that God's justice and mercy could meet.
[5629.90 --> 5634.90]  And the resurrection is proof of this, that death is undone, that sin is defeated, and that
[5634.90 --> 5636.90]  life is secure.
[5636.90 --> 5646.90]  And because this is true, you are sent to proclaim it, to live as a witness to Jesus Christ, to
[5646.90 --> 5650.90]  live as a witness to this empty tomb.
[5650.90 --> 5653.90]  That's the logic of the gospel.
[5653.90 --> 5654.90]  Right?
[5654.90 --> 5661.90]  That the cross and the resurrection secure salvation and therefore send us out on mission.
[5661.90 --> 5664.90]  But here's my last word.
[5664.90 --> 5666.90]  This mission is not a burden.
[5666.90 --> 5668.90]  It's an invitation.
[5668.90 --> 5669.90]  Right?
[5669.90 --> 5674.90]  You are sent from this place with the words,
[5674.90 --> 5679.90]  Do not be afraid, not to earn anything, but to announce everything.
[5679.90 --> 5680.90]  Right?
[5680.90 --> 5685.90]  You are not sent on your own strength, but you are sent in His authority.
[5685.90 --> 5693.90]  And Jesus says, surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.
[5693.90 --> 5694.90]  This is the invitation.
[5694.90 --> 5695.90]  This is the invitation.
[5695.90 --> 5696.90]  Behold your King.
[5696.90 --> 5704.90]  See in Him and in His cross love and mercy meeting.
[5704.90 --> 5709.90]  See Him in His resurrection where death itself is swallowed up.
[5709.90 --> 5713.90]  See Him in His commission in sending us out to the nations.
[5713.90 --> 5720.90]  And as you behold your King, let your heart rise to worship.
[5720.90 --> 5728.90]  I want to invite the worship team to come up as we finish this time together.
[5728.90 --> 5735.90]  Because in the end, the resurrection is not only something to be explained, it's something
[5735.90 --> 5736.90]  to be adored.
[5736.90 --> 5739.90]  It's not just a truth to defend.
[5739.90 --> 5741.90]  It's a person to worship.
[5741.90 --> 5742.90]  Right?
[5742.90 --> 5747.90]  The one who was crucified is risen and now says to you, do not be afraid.
[5747.90 --> 5755.90]  I'm going to ask all of you, if you can, stand up.
[5755.90 --> 5762.90]  So come, weary heart, behold your King.
[5762.90 --> 5766.90]  Come, broken sinner, behold your King.
[5766.90 --> 5770.90]  Come, doubting disciple, fearful of death.
[5770.90 --> 5772.90]  Behold your King in this moment.
[5772.90 --> 5775.90]  The cross is not defeat.
[5775.90 --> 5776.90]  It is victory.
[5776.90 --> 5777.90]  The tomb is not the end.
[5777.90 --> 5778.90]  It is the beginning.
[5778.90 --> 5780.90]  Death is not the master.
[5780.90 --> 5781.90]  Christ is.
[5781.90 --> 5786.90]  And because He lives, you too will live.
[5786.90 --> 5788.90]  And so, lift up your eyes.
[5788.90 --> 5789.90]  Lift up your voice.
[5789.90 --> 5791.90]  Lift up your heart.
[5791.90 --> 5798.90]  Behold the crucified and risen Jesus, your Savior, your Lord, your King.
[5798.90 --> 5801.90]  Worship Him.
[5801.90 --> 5805.90]  Let's worship Him in song right now.
[5805.90 --> 5830.90]  Let's worship Him in song right now.
[5830.90 --> 5837.90]  See Him there, the great I am.
[5837.90 --> 5844.90]  The crown of gold upon His hand.
[5844.90 --> 5851.90]  The Father's heart displayed for us.
[5851.90 --> 5862.90]  Oh God, we thank you for the crown.
[5862.90 --> 5868.90]  Lifted up on Calvary's end.
[5868.90 --> 5872.90]  We curse your name.
[5872.90 --> 5878.90]  And we unstill you for our shame.
[5878.90 --> 5882.90]  And take the cross.
[5882.90 --> 5889.90]  Oh God, we thank you for the crown.
[5893.90 --> 5897.90]  Behold the Lamb.
[5897.90 --> 5903.90]  The story of redemption written on His hands.
[5903.90 --> 5907.90]  Jesus, you will reign forevermore.
[5908.90 --> 5912.90]  The victory is yours.
[5913.90 --> 5916.90]  We sing your praise.
[5917.90 --> 5922.90]  Endless hallelujahs to your holy name.
[5922.90 --> 5927.90]  Jesus, you will reign forevermore.
[5927.90 --> 5932.90]  The victory is yours.
[5932.90 --> 5941.90]  Offer up His sacrifice.
[5941.90 --> 5947.90]  For every sin our Savior done.
[5947.90 --> 5948.90]  The Lord of mine.
[5948.90 --> 5949.90]  The Lord of mine.
[5949.90 --> 5950.90]  The Lord of mine.
[5950.90 --> 5954.90]  His peace contains.
[5954.90 --> 5962.90]  Our God has risen from the grave.
[5962.90 --> 5968.90]  Oh, our God has risen from the grave.
[5968.90 --> 5971.90]  Oh, our God has risen from their feet.
[5971.90 --> 5985.90]  The Saviorunda does not.
[5985.90 --> 5989.90]  The glory of His grace.
[5989.90 --> 5999.58]  We sing your praise, endless hallelujahs to your holy name.
[5999.58 --> 6009.24]  Jesus, you will reign forevermore, the victory is yours.
[6009.24 --> 6025.54]  When the age of death is done, we'll see your face bright as the sun.
[6025.54 --> 6039.22]  We'll bow before the King of kings, O God, forever we will sing.
[6039.24 --> 6054.32]  We bow before the Lamb, the story of redemption is on its hands.
[6054.32 --> 6063.32]  Jesus, you will reign forevermore, the victory is yours.
[6063.32 --> 6073.60]  We sing your praise, endless hallelujahs to your holy name.
[6074.28 --> 6081.32]  Jesus, you will reign forevermore, the victory is yours.
[6081.32 --> 6087.52]  You will reign forevermore, the victory is yours.
[6087.52 --> 6094.32]  Jesus, you will reign forevermore, the victory is yours.
[6094.32 --> 6116.22]  You are sent in the power of God who has defeated death.
[6116.22 --> 6120.38]  You are sent in the power of resurrection.
