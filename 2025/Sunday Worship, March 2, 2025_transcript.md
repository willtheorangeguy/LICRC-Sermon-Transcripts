[312.00 --> 314.00]  Yeah.
[314.00 --> 316.00]  Happy days.

[328.00 --> 329.00]  Bye, my friend.
[330.00 --> 332.00]  This is only 60 nooit.
[332.00 --> 332.34]  Unfortunately,
[332.34 --> 334.34]  this is 50 o'clock.
[338.42 --> 340.46]  All right.
[341.00 --> 342.00]  Thank you very much.
[342.00 --> 344.38]  I need to do here.
[344.38 --> 346.38]  Thanks.
[346.38 --> 348.00]  I need them to do all this.
[348.00 --> 365.18]  I'm just explaining this to my wife.
[365.18 --> 367.68]  I didn't hear it to my parents.
[368.80 --> 371.18]  Parents twice made a school before parents.
[371.18 --> 372.74]  So she's a great person.
[372.74 --> 373.52]  She's a great person.
[373.52 --> 374.52]  She's a great person.
[374.52 --> 375.52]  She's a great person.
[375.52 --> 405.50]  She's a great person.
[405.52 --> 409.52]  She's a great person.
[409.52 --> 413.52]  She's a great person.
[413.52 --> 417.52]  She's a great person.
[417.52 --> 447.50]  Thank you.

[602.52 --> 603.88]  New
[603.88 --> 606.52]  двух
[606.52 --> 612.62]  With you, God, it all comes down to this.
[613.30 --> 617.16]  To be your hands and feet.
[618.52 --> 621.98]  Good news to all the world.
[622.78 --> 625.82]  Oh, the truth will set us.
[628.40 --> 629.78]  Good morning.
[630.96 --> 632.80]  Oh, I think we can do better than that.
[632.84 --> 633.42]  Good morning.
[634.42 --> 635.90]  Hey, much better.
[635.90 --> 637.72]  Welcome to church.
[638.18 --> 640.94]  Special welcome if you are a guest with us this morning.
[641.38 --> 646.14]  An extra special welcome if you are a guest with us this morning from Vernon,
[646.74 --> 651.04]  here for the Mexico Mission Team Commissioning Service.
[651.16 --> 654.54]  We are grateful to gather in worship this morning.
[654.88 --> 655.56]  My name is Chris.
[656.04 --> 661.02]  I'm one of the pastors here at Emanuel, and it's my blessing to lead along with a few others
[661.02 --> 663.84]  and some we haven't yet seen in our shared worship together.
[663.84 --> 668.54]  Before we begin in earnest, we've got a couple announcements that we want to make sure everyone
[668.54 --> 668.92]  hears.
[669.90 --> 674.54]  And so, first of all, as I've already mentioned, the Mexico Mission Team, we're still looking
[674.54 --> 678.04]  for drivers to get them to and from the airport.
[678.80 --> 683.94]  As I understand it, we have enough drivers except one for the way there.
[683.94 --> 689.64]  So, we need one more driver for the way there, and then we need, as I heard, a whole slew of
[689.64 --> 691.72]  drivers for the way back yet.
[692.16 --> 695.40]  And so, if you are able to do that, please talk to Brandon.
[695.58 --> 697.26]  He's over there after service.
[697.72 --> 701.26]  Or Pastor Kevin or myself will help coordinate and figure that out.
[701.26 --> 707.76]  After worship today, youth coffee is taking place at the Kuhl's house.
[708.00 --> 710.28]  And so, Kuhl's, raise your hands if you need directions.
[710.40 --> 710.86]  There you go.
[711.40 --> 714.40]  Pastor Kevin also can give information about what that means.
[714.48 --> 717.22]  That's for the youth involved in our youth ministry here.
[717.46 --> 721.08]  Go and have coffee and some lunch at their house today.
[721.08 --> 727.58]  And then, lastly, on Wednesday, the season of Lent is beginning.
[728.26 --> 736.06]  And so, the season of Lent is a time of introspection and reflection as we approach Good Friday and Easter Sunday.
[736.46 --> 743.00]  A time where we prepare our hearts and reflect on the truth of Jesus coming to live and to die in our place.
[743.40 --> 746.96]  And so, we begin that with an Ash Wednesday service.
[747.20 --> 749.68]  That's going to happen at 7 a.m.
[749.68 --> 751.50]  Hear that correctly?
[751.62 --> 760.10]  7 a.m. on Ash Wednesday so that we can enter that season in a sort of sunrise opportunity to begin it,
[760.36 --> 762.72]  reflecting on our own mortality and sin.
[763.12 --> 766.64]  And then, we'll be sent out into that day, into that season.
[767.36 --> 770.30]  The service is only about half an hour at 7 a.m.
[770.30 --> 773.00]  So, most of you will still make it to work on time.
[773.00 --> 780.52]  But we look forward to seeing as many of you as possible at our 7 a.m. Ash Wednesday service this coming week.
[781.32 --> 783.02]  That's it for our announcements this morning.
[783.18 --> 785.64]  And so, as you're able, and where you are, I'm going to invite you to stand.
[786.34 --> 788.56]  We can be gathered up into God's presence together.
[789.08 --> 791.22]  We mark that by receiving His greeting.
[791.22 --> 797.88]  And then, after we receive God's greeting, I invite you to turn to those around you and welcome them into worship.
[798.42 --> 800.68]  I don't have to remind you of this, but just a note.
[801.06 --> 806.16]  It's cold and cough season still, and so not everybody wants to shake hands or hug or the like.
[806.82 --> 811.42]  And so, just make sure you get some sort of, like, visual cue that a handshake is okay.
[812.80 --> 814.68]  Otherwise, you can head nod and just say,
[814.84 --> 815.22]  Good morning.
[815.36 --> 816.46]  Peace of Christ be with you.
[816.46 --> 820.02]  Receive the greeting of our God in worship this morning.
[821.30 --> 824.54]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you.
[824.94 --> 828.86]  From God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, His Son, and our Savior,
[829.30 --> 831.84]  through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[832.84 --> 833.28]  Amen.
[836.16 --> 837.26]  Morning. Peace of Christ.
[837.86 --> 839.00]  Morning. Peace of Christ.
[839.90 --> 841.80]  Kezia, morning. Peace of Christ.
[846.90 --> 847.34]  Morning.
[849.00 --> 850.40]  Morning, Ruby. Peace of Christ.
[850.64 --> 850.90]  Morning.
[852.20 --> 853.34]  Morning. Peace of Christ.
[853.54 --> 853.74]  Morning.
[853.94 --> 855.48]  I feel like my microphone is still on.
[856.14 --> 856.90]  Go ahead.
[856.90 --> 856.92]  Go ahead.
[856.92 --> 886.90]  Thank you.
[886.90 --> 893.54]  Good morning. Welcome to worship this morning. In Matthew 18 verse 20, Jesus says,
[893.90 --> 900.12]  For where two or three are gathered in my name, there I am with them. Today we gather
[900.12 --> 905.52]  together in the great name of Jesus, our hope and our strength. Let's worship him together.
[905.52 --> 927.52]  Jesus, hope of the nations. Jesus, come before all who bore. You are the source of heaven's
[927.52 --> 946.28]  light on earth. Jesus, light in the darkness. Jesus, through this circumstance. You are the source of heaven's light on earth.
[946.28 --> 955.28]  In history, you live in God. You are all the chains. You are all to die.
[956.28 --> 971.14]  You are the hope, living in us. You are the rock, living in us. You are the light, shining on all the world to see.
[971.14 --> 977.12]  You are the way, believing in us. You are theiri. Your heart, living in a establish M linearly.
[977.88 --> 995.14]  You are the advocate for law, and мясe is theесть. You are the devil, andét me as a passer.
[995.14 --> 1003.40]  Jesus, hope of the nations
[1003.40 --> 1009.06]  Jesus, conquer for all who are born
[1009.06 --> 1014.62]  You are the source of heaven's oil and fire
[1014.62 --> 1020.90]  Jesus, light in the darkness
[1020.90 --> 1025.66]  Jesus, in the eternal sense
[1025.66 --> 1032.28]  You are the source of heaven's light on earth
[1032.28 --> 1037.00]  In history, you live without
[1037.00 --> 1042.78]  You broke the chain to go to us
[1042.78 --> 1047.02]  You are the hope, you live in us
[1047.02 --> 1051.30]  You are the love, you will we trust
[1051.30 --> 1058.02]  You are the light, shining for all the world to see
[1058.02 --> 1064.08]  You are the source of death, conquer we fear
[1064.08 --> 1067.78]  Our friends of peace, drive us in
[1067.78 --> 1075.02]  Jesus, our hope, living for all the world to see
[1075.02 --> 1078.74]  Lord, we believe
[1078.74 --> 1082.84]  Lord, we believe
[1082.84 --> 1087.22]  Lord, we believe
[1087.22 --> 1092.98]  Lord, we believe
[1092.98 --> 1095.04]  Lord, we believe
[1095.04 --> 1097.04]  Lord, we believe
[1097.04 --> 1100.94]  Lord, we believe
[1100.94 --> 1114.70]  Lord, we believe
[1114.70 --> 1120.28]  It is a wonder of the King
[1120.28 --> 1126.46]  Gold in majesty
[1126.46 --> 1132.46]  All the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice
[1132.46 --> 1138.46]  In the essence of the night
[1138.46 --> 1143.46]  The darkness rise to life
[1143.46 --> 1149.46]  And trembles at His voice, trembles at His voice
[1149.46 --> 1160.46]  How great is our love, sing with me How great is our love
[1160.46 --> 1171.46]  In all the sea of rain, how great is our love
[1171.46 --> 1179.46]  From age to age He stands
[1179.46 --> 1183.46]  And time is in His hands
[1183.46 --> 1189.46]  Beginning and the end, beginning and the end
[1189.46 --> 1195.46]  But God agreed in one
[1195.46 --> 1200.46]  Falling spirit inside
[1200.46 --> 1203.46]  The lion at the end
[1203.46 --> 1207.46]  The lion at the end
[1207.46 --> 1217.46]  How great is our love, sing with me How great is our love
[1217.46 --> 1227.46]  You all will see how great, how great is our love
[1227.46 --> 1241.46]  The name above all names Worthy of all names
[1241.46 --> 1251.46]  My heart will sing with me How great is our love
[1251.46 --> 1264.46]  The name above all names Worthy of all praise
[1264.46 --> 1274.46]  I want to sing How great is our love
[1274.46 --> 1286.46]  How great is our love Sing with me how great is our love
[1286.46 --> 1288.46]  How great is our love
[1288.46 --> 1292.46]  How great is our love
[1292.46 --> 1296.46]  How great is our love
[1296.46 --> 1307.46]  Our confession and assurance today is this
[1307.46 --> 1310.46]  When we offer God our confession
[1310.46 --> 1314.46]  We enter the beautiful work of reconciliation
[1314.46 --> 1319.46]  Which begins with our confessing our sins and sinful nature to God
[1319.46 --> 1322.46]  And trusting in His grace
[1322.46 --> 1327.46]  Let us take a few moments now in time of personal silent prayer
[1344.46 --> 1345.46]  And loving the Lord
[1345.46 --> 1346.46]  How great is your love
[1346.46 --> 1349.46]  And the words of heart
[1349.46 --> 1351.46]  Let us ask whether your love
[1351.46 --> 1354.46]  Or what God rebounds
[1354.46 --> 1355.46]  Let us take my hand
[1355.46 --> 1356.46]  For each of our hearts
[1356.46 --> 1357.46]  Is there for you
[1357.46 --> 1359.44]  To this very people
[1359.44 --> 1359.46]  sev anything
[1359.46 --> 1364.46]  We pray
[1364.46 --> 1369.46]  Let us just work
[1369.46 --> 1370.46]  To theце
[1370.46 --> 1371.46]  The rebellion
[1371.46 --> 1373.46]  For none
[1373.46 --> 1376.80]  Gracious and loving God,
[1377.62 --> 1380.10]  we have opened our hearts
[1380.10 --> 1385.10]  so that we are able to admit to you the paradoxes of our lives,
[1385.94 --> 1387.98]  that which is beautiful and good
[1387.98 --> 1391.42]  and that which is hurtful and sinful.
[1392.76 --> 1397.24]  We confess that we do not imitate Jesus in all that we do.
[1398.24 --> 1399.80]  Forgive us, we pray.
[1399.80 --> 1408.50]  Forgive our sin and empower us to be imitators of Christ in love and service.
[1408.96 --> 1409.58]  Amen.
[1412.92 --> 1419.24]  Friends in Christ, we have our assurance in knowing this.
[1420.02 --> 1423.32]  The mercy of God is from everlasting to everlasting,
[1423.80 --> 1427.08]  and we are reminded of his unsurpassing grace.
[1427.08 --> 1430.96]  In Jesus Christ, we, we are forgiven.
[1430.96 --> 1457.46]  The love of God is greater far than tongue,
[1457.46 --> 1460.64]  nor can you never tell.
[1461.00 --> 1464.46]  It goes beyond the highest star
[1464.98 --> 1469.36]  and reaches to the lowest hell.
[1469.84 --> 1473.76]  What guilty pair bowed down with care,
[1474.16 --> 1477.46]  God gave his son to win.
[1477.46 --> 1482.58]  His erring child, he reconciled,
[1482.58 --> 1487.02]  and pardoned from his sin.
[1487.02 --> 1491.06]  Lamb of God, how rich and pure,
[1491.38 --> 1495.34]  how measureless and strong,
[1495.68 --> 1499.46]  he shall forevermore endure
[1499.46 --> 1504.08]  the saints and angels' song.
[1504.08 --> 1510.26]  When years of time shall pass away,
[1510.26 --> 1514.52]  and earthly thrones and kingdoms fall,
[1514.52 --> 1518.80]  when men who hear refuse to pray,
[1518.80 --> 1523.06]  on rocks and hills and mountains fall,
[1523.44 --> 1527.24]  God's love so sure shall endure,
[1527.62 --> 1531.58]  all measureless and strong,
[1531.58 --> 1538.58]  He shall forevermore endure,
[1538.58 --> 1539.96]  the saints and angels' song.
[1539.96 --> 1544.24]  O love of God, how rich and pure,
[1544.64 --> 1548.38]  how measureless and strong,
[1548.76 --> 1552.40]  he shall forevermore endure
[1552.40 --> 1557.50]  the saints and angels' song.
[1557.50 --> 1563.18]  Could we with ink the ocean fill,
[1563.18 --> 1567.64]  and were the skies of parchment made,
[1567.88 --> 1571.80]  where every stalk on earth a quail,
[1572.18 --> 1576.18]  and every man a scribe I drink,
[1576.56 --> 1580.56]  to write the love of God above,
[1580.88 --> 1584.78]  would drain the ocean dry,
[1584.78 --> 1587.22]  nor can the scroll,
[1587.22 --> 1589.04]  nor can the scroll continue hold,
[1589.04 --> 1589.10]  nor can the scroll continue hold,
[1589.10 --> 1589.12]  nor can the scroll continue hold,
[1589.12 --> 1593.32]  the stripes through sky to sky.
[1593.32 --> 1597.54]  O love of God, how rich and pure,
[1597.54 --> 1601.82]  how measureless and strong,
[1601.82 --> 1605.88]  he shall forevermore endure,
[1605.88 --> 1610.32]  the saints and angels' song.
[1610.32 --> 1627.84]  O love of God,��
[1628.00 --> 1637.22]  that you as a child draw,
[1637.22 --> 1667.20]  Thank you.
[1667.22 --> 1688.22]  I love you, Lord, and I lift my heart to worship you.
[1688.22 --> 1705.22]  All my soul rejoice, take joy, my King, in what you hear.
[1705.22 --> 1717.22]  Give me a sweet, sweet sound in your ear.
[1717.22 --> 1735.34]  I love you, Lord, and I lift my voice to worship you.
[1735.34 --> 1752.34]  All my soul rejoice, take joy, my King, in what you hear.
[1752.34 --> 1762.34]  Give me a sweet, sweet sound in your ear.
[1762.34 --> 1768.34]  I exalt Thee.
[1768.34 --> 1774.34]  I exalt Thee.
[1774.34 --> 1780.34]  I exalt Thee.
[1780.34 --> 1792.34]  I exalt Thee.
[1792.34 --> 1798.34]  I exalt Thee.
[1798.34 --> 1804.34]  I exalt Thee.
[1804.34 --> 1810.34]  Oh, Lord.
[1810.34 --> 1816.34]  I exalt Thee.
[1816.34 --> 1822.34]  I exalt Thee.
[1822.34 --> 1827.34]  I exalt Thee.
[1827.34 --> 1833.34]  Oh, Lord.
[1833.34 --> 1839.34]  I exalt Thee.
[1839.34 --> 1845.34]  I exalt Thee.
[1845.34 --> 1850.34]  I exalt Thee.
[1850.34 --> 1851.34]  I exalt Thee.
[1851.34 --> 1855.34]  Oh, Lord.
[1855.34 --> 1856.34]  I exalt Thee.
[1856.34 --> 1865.34]  I exalt Thee.
[1865.34 --> 1866.34]  I exalt Thee.
[1866.34 --> 1868.34]  I exalt Thee.
[1868.34 --> 1874.24]  This morning, as part of our worship, we have the chance to commission, and that means to send with
[1874.24 --> 1880.96]  a purpose in the power of the Holy Spirit, a group going to Mexico. Now, I'm going to take this
[1880.96 --> 1885.90]  opportunity and just invite that group to come forward. Just come up here, stand along the front
[1885.90 --> 1892.32]  here so that everyone can see you in a moment. We'll pray over you and commission you for this
[1892.32 --> 1902.54]  work together. So, leaders as well, everyone who's going, come on up. There's a lot of Langley people
[1902.54 --> 1911.50]  missing, figures. Way to represent, Vernon. They had five hours to get to church this morning, and they
[1911.50 --> 1924.70]  made it. Most of us here already know this, but if you don't, this church has a more than 25-year
[1924.70 --> 1934.24]  history of partnering with groups and people down in Tijuana and Rosarito, Mexico, for mission. So,
[1934.30 --> 1940.72]  we partner with Jody and Uriel in the work that they do in Rosarito in a men's ministry and a
[1940.72 --> 1947.44]  women's ministry out of their church. We partner with Pastor Abelino in the Iglesia de la Rection
[1947.44 --> 1955.94]  in East TJ and the work that they do there in the slums of Tijuana, meeting people there. And we have
[1955.94 --> 1961.34]  a long history of working with them, and it is a beautiful story of partnership and a beautiful
[1961.34 --> 1969.26]  picture, I believe, of the church spanning across the globe and how we have brothers and sisters,
[1969.26 --> 1977.10]  family of God in places like Tijuana and Rosarito. And we get to partner with them and serve them.
[1977.66 --> 1984.52]  And what's amazing about this is this has always been how God works. God has always used people and
[1984.52 --> 1992.02]  sent people around the world to proclaim his gospel message. The message of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[1992.02 --> 1998.52]  who lived, died, and was raised again. The message of the kingdom of God come and the kingdom of God
[1998.52 --> 2009.66]  coming. Today, we commission you guys with this mission, with this message. You are sent out with
[2009.66 --> 2018.34]  the gospel to make disciples everywhere and to be disciples everywhere. And for those of you heading to
[2018.34 --> 2026.50]  Tijuana and to Rosarito for this mission, go with the gospel. Go with the power of God in the Holy Spirit
[2026.50 --> 2034.32]  in you and through you. And may God bless your efforts. May he bless your relationships. And may you
[2034.32 --> 2041.36]  be blessed to see the fruits of your labors in this work. I'm going to invite Pastor Kevin to come
[2041.36 --> 2051.42]  forward. He's going to lead in a prayer. First of all, I'm going to invite you all to stand like about
[2051.42 --> 2057.32]  here. So take two big steps forward. And then I'm going to invite any family, friends, elders, anyone
[2057.32 --> 2062.26]  who wants to pray over this team to come on up. You can make your way right now. We're going to lay
[2062.26 --> 2067.00]  hands on them. If we fill up the front of the church, that is okay. So come on to the front. We're
[2067.00 --> 2070.56]  going to lay hands on this team and then we will send them off in prayer.
[2088.56 --> 2089.92]  Let us pray.
[2089.92 --> 2099.30]  Our Father in heaven, we are grateful for your gospel truth found in your Son, Jesus Christ's life,
[2099.40 --> 2106.56]  death, and resurrection. And Lord, as this team of youth, of adults, of young adults heads down to
[2106.56 --> 2112.18]  Tijuana in just under two weeks, Lord, we pray that you will be with them as they bring that gospel
[2112.18 --> 2118.70]  truth with them. May they be your hands and feet in that community. May they continue to work alongside
[2118.70 --> 2123.90]  our friends and family down there like Pastor Abilino, like Pastor Andrew, like Jody and Uriel,
[2124.28 --> 2129.36]  with so many other of our missionary friends and pastors, Lord. We pray that they are able to go down
[2129.36 --> 2136.60]  to connect to the communities down there and to bring your love and your message of truth to those
[2136.60 --> 2142.40]  people. Lord, we thank you for our friends down in Mexico and we pray that you'll continue to be with
[2142.40 --> 2146.66]  them as well. Be with this team. Give them what they need. We pray for safety on their travels.
[2146.66 --> 2154.10]  We pray for courage as they step out of their comfort zones. We pray for rest as they endure long days,
[2154.22 --> 2159.40]  Lord. And we just pray, God, that you continue to support them and walk alongside of them as they do
[2159.40 --> 2166.96]  this work. God, may this be a time that is glorifying to you. And we give this over to you in your
[2166.96 --> 2170.62]  son's precious and holy name. Amen. Amen.
[2170.62 --> 2170.72]  Amen.
[2196.96 --> 2206.70]  Good morning. My name is Mike and I am a deacon at this church and I'm also a part of the Mexico
[2206.70 --> 2212.12]  team. And today we have a chance to also give financially a little bit more to that trip. So
[2212.12 --> 2217.64]  first of all, thank you on behalf of the team for the way this church gives and gives and has
[2217.64 --> 2222.70]  supported this ministry for many, many years. And especially for a prayer that has been going on
[2222.70 --> 2228.14]  for weeks for this and even just now for that commissioning. And so you heard a little bit
[2228.14 --> 2234.54]  about what the team is doing and the makeup of the team. And this trip, one of the kind of bigger
[2234.54 --> 2239.44]  outreach projects that the team's going to undertake, there's a couple big ones. One is a kids festival
[2239.44 --> 2246.96]  that's going to take place as well as a bit of a Tijuana version of Reactivate. So we're helping host
[2246.96 --> 2254.36]  a bit of a conference on a weekend for local teens in a variety of, or from a few churches in the area.
[2254.84 --> 2259.04]  So those are kind of two big things we're doing as well as there is a missionary friend we've worked
[2259.04 --> 2264.26]  with for years. They are part of a church plant and we'll be doing some work with them upgrading
[2264.26 --> 2271.32]  their church facility. So we have that in our budget as kind of some of the ministry outreach stuff that
[2271.32 --> 2276.96]  we are still hoping to raise a couple thousand dollars for to facilitate that ministry. So that
[2276.96 --> 2282.72]  is what today's offering essentially will go to cover. So thank you for your generosity
[2282.72 --> 2285.12]  and thank you for giving with a joyful heart.
[2312.72 --> 2336.66]  a song from onslaught
[2336.66 --> 2338.66]  with me.
[2339.66 --> 2341.12]  The changes
[2341.12 --> 2343.12]  come in
[2343.12 --> 2344.78]  your passions
[2344.78 --> 2347.28]  they fail, Lord.
[2347.92 --> 2348.64]  As
[2348.64 --> 2350.66]  thou hast me
[2350.66 --> 2352.82]  thou forever
[2352.82 --> 2354.72]  will be.
[2356.16 --> 2356.90]  Where
[2356.90 --> 2358.66]  is thy faithfulness?
[2360.24 --> 2360.66]  Where
[2360.66 --> 2362.66]  is thy faithfulness?
[2364.42 --> 2364.66]  Lord,
[2364.66 --> 2366.66]  in thy morning
[2367.38 --> 2368.44]  new
[2368.44 --> 2370.52]  blessings I
[2370.52 --> 2371.52]  see.
[2372.52 --> 2374.66]  All I have
[2374.66 --> 2376.70]  near the
[2376.70 --> 2378.66]  earth and the
[2378.66 --> 2379.66]  fire,
[2380.86 --> 2382.28]  great is
[2382.28 --> 2384.66]  the faithfulness
[2384.66 --> 2386.66]  glory to
[2386.66 --> 2388.42]  me.

[2394.60 --> 2396.60]  and springtime
[2396.60 --> 2398.60]  and harvest

[2404.60 --> 2405.60]  of
[2405.60 --> 2406.60]  time.
[2406.60 --> 2408.60]  Join
[2408.60 --> 2409.60]  with all
[2409.60 --> 2410.60]  nature

[2513.60 --> 2514.60]  I

[2524.60 --> 2525.60]  thy

[2526.60 --> 2527.60]  brought
[2527.60 --> 2528.60]  unto
[2528.60 --> 2529.60]  me.
[2533.60 --> 2535.60]  I
[2535.60 --> 2537.60]  would
[2537.60 --> 2538.60]  love
[2538.60 --> 2539.60]  to invite
[2539.60 --> 2540.60]  all of the
[2540.60 --> 2541.60]  kids to come
[2541.60 --> 2542.60]  forward and join
[2542.60 --> 2543.60]  me up here at the
[2543.60 --> 2544.60]  front.
[2544.60 --> 2546.60]  That was fast.
[2546.60 --> 2548.60]  So fast.
[2553.60 --> 2554.60]  Good
[2554.60 --> 2555.60]  morning,
[2555.60 --> 2556.60]  everybody.
[2558.60 --> 2559.60]  Good morning,
[2559.60 --> 2560.60]  everyone.
[2560.60 --> 2561.60]  Good morning.
[2561.60 --> 2562.60]  How are we all doing?
[2562.60 --> 2563.60]  I
[2563.60 --> 2564.60]  have
[2564.60 --> 2565.60]  Hank with me,
[2565.60 --> 2566.60]  but he's off to the side.
[2566.60 --> 2567.60]  I think you need to shout,
[2567.60 --> 2569.60]  come on out, Hank,
[2569.60 --> 2570.60]  and then he might join us.
[2570.60 --> 2571.60]  Are you ready? One, two, three.
[2571.60 --> 2572.60]  Come out, Hank!
[2574.60 --> 2576.60]  I think it needs to be a little bit louder than that.
[2577.60 --> 2578.60]  One, two, three.
[2578.60 --> 2579.60]  Come out, Hank!
[2580.60 --> 2581.60]  Ah!
[2582.60 --> 2584.60]  Here he is.
[2584.60 --> 2585.60]  Hey, kids!
[2586.60 --> 2587.60]  Hi, Hank! Hi.
[2587.60 --> 2588.60]  Hank!
[2588.60 --> 2591.60]  It looks like you were chewing some sort of a sour sock this morning.
[2591.60 --> 2592.60]  What's wrong with you?
[2592.60 --> 2594.60]  I had a bit of a week.
[2594.60 --> 2595.60]  You did? What happened?
[2596.60 --> 2602.60]  Well, I was at the park, and there was three fun people over there hanging out.
[2602.60 --> 2606.60]  A cat, and a parrot, and a frog.
[2606.60 --> 2608.60]  And I went over to say hi.
[2608.60 --> 2609.60]  Oh, and then what happened?
[2610.60 --> 2613.60]  Well, they said they're part of a cool critter club.
[2613.60 --> 2615.60]  But I wasn't allowed.
[2615.60 --> 2616.60]  What?
[2616.60 --> 2617.60]  Yeah.
[2617.60 --> 2621.60]  The cat, whose name was Fergus, said,
[2621.60 --> 2623.60]  I can't jump high enough.
[2623.60 --> 2624.60]  Oh, really?
[2624.60 --> 2625.60]  Yeah.
[2625.60 --> 2628.60]  And the parrot, Wingston, said,
[2628.60 --> 2629.60]  I can't fly.
[2629.60 --> 2630.60]  Oh, no!
[2630.60 --> 2631.60]  Yeah!
[2631.60 --> 2635.60]  And the frog, Amphibionc, said,
[2635.60 --> 2638.60]  that I can't catch flies with my tongue.
[2638.60 --> 2639.60]  Oh, no!
[2639.60 --> 2640.60]  Yeah!
[2640.60 --> 2641.60]  It made me sad.
[2641.60 --> 2643.60]  But guess what happened next?
[2643.60 --> 2644.60]  What happened next?
[2644.60 --> 2653.60]  A squirrel named A. Cornelius lost his chestnut under a rock and asked for help.
[2653.60 --> 2656.60]  Well, did those other cats and frogs and parrots help?
[2656.60 --> 2657.60]  No.
[2657.60 --> 2660.60]  The cat said she didn't want to get her paws dirty.
[2660.60 --> 2663.60]  And the parrot said he flies and doesn't really dig.
[2663.60 --> 2671.60]  And the frog, Amphibionc, yeah, I remember, he, he, she said that he, she doesn't eat rocks and nuts.
[2671.60 --> 2672.60]  She just eats bugs.
[2672.60 --> 2673.60]  So what did happen?
[2673.60 --> 2682.60]  Well, I went, because I'm a dog, yeah, and I dug up the chestnut for the squirrel and saved the day.
[2682.60 --> 2683.60]  Wow, that's really cool.
[2683.60 --> 2685.60]  Yeah, and then guess what?
[2685.60 --> 2686.60]  What?
[2686.60 --> 2691.60]  Well, then the other three critters saw what I did and they wanted to hang out with me and the squirrel.
[2691.60 --> 2693.60]  Hank, that's so great.
[2693.60 --> 2694.60]  Yeah!
[2694.60 --> 2702.60]  You weren't invited into an area, but then you helped someone with kindness and then everyone was invited to hang out.
[2702.60 --> 2703.60]  Yeah!
[2703.60 --> 2709.60]  Well, in children's worship time, we're going to talk about how Jesus invites everyone to follow him.
[2709.60 --> 2710.60]  Wow!
[2710.60 --> 2714.60]  What a coincidence that those two stories line up!
[2714.60 --> 2715.60]  I know!
[2715.60 --> 2716.60]  That's so great!
[2716.60 --> 2721.60]  So we're going to take some time and go to children's worship time and talk more about Jesus, okay?
[2721.60 --> 2722.60]  Okay!
[2722.60 --> 2726.60]  But first, we're going to pray and then we're going to do the Lord's blessing, alright?
[2726.60 --> 2727.60]  Alright, let's pray.
[2727.60 --> 2729.60]  Father God, thank you so much for this day.
[2729.60 --> 2732.60]  Thank you that we could come to church and that we could learn more about you.
[2732.60 --> 2738.60]  And be with us as we go to children's worship time and the adults as they stay back here and listen to Pastor Chris.
[2738.60 --> 2742.60]  May we all learn more about what it means to follow you in this world.
[2742.60 --> 2743.60]  We pray this in your name.
[2743.60 --> 2744.60]  Amen.
[2744.60 --> 2745.60]  Alright, let's stand up.
[2745.60 --> 2746.60]  Oh, oh, oh!
[2746.60 --> 2747.60]  Not yet!
[2747.60 --> 2748.60]  Not yet!
[2748.60 --> 2749.60]  We have to do the blessing together.
[2749.60 --> 2752.60]  Okay, we're going to say the Lord be with you all at the same time.
[2752.60 --> 2753.60]  Are you ready?
[2753.60 --> 2754.60]  One, two, three.
[2754.60 --> 2756.60]  The Lord be with you.
[2756.60 --> 2758.60]  And also with you.
[2758.60 --> 2772.60]  Six years of seminary, ladies and gentlemen.
[2772.60 --> 2782.60]  Speaking of six years of seminary, I want to take a moment and invite a friend of mine,
[2782.60 --> 2785.60]  a colleague of mine, Susan, up to the front.
[2785.60 --> 2790.60]  Susan is the Director of Candidacy in the Christian Reformed Church.
[2790.60 --> 2794.60]  And she's here for a classist meeting that we have this coming week.
[2794.60 --> 2800.60]  Classist is the word that we use to refer to the regional group of Christian Reformed Churches.
[2800.60 --> 2801.60]  We have a meeting next week.
[2801.60 --> 2803.60]  Susan's going to help us run a session there.
[2803.60 --> 2812.60]  But I asked if she would join us in our worship this morning and then just give us a little bit about what she does and how that's connected to the broader work of our churches together.
[2812.60 --> 2814.60]  So, Susan, welcome.
[2814.60 --> 2815.60]  Thank you.
[2815.60 --> 2817.60]  It should be.
[2817.60 --> 2818.60]  Susan, welcome.
[2818.60 --> 2819.60]  Yeah.
[2819.60 --> 2820.60]  I can't believe I have to go after that.
[2820.60 --> 2825.60]  Like the best children's message ever with the best voices and the best puppet.
[2825.60 --> 2826.60]  I loved it.
[2826.60 --> 2829.60]  But my name is Susan LeClear, as Chris said.
[2829.60 --> 2832.60]  And I come to you from Canada's 11th province.
[2832.60 --> 2835.60]  I live in Michigan in the United States.
[2835.60 --> 2836.60]  And, yeah.
[2836.60 --> 2842.60]  I mean, I thought it was a pretty good burn.
[2842.60 --> 2844.60]  Deserved.
[2844.60 --> 2846.60]  Totally deserved.
[2846.60 --> 2851.60]  So, anyway, it's a hard time to be an American and an embarrassing time to be American.
[2851.60 --> 2852.60]  But anyway.
[2852.60 --> 2853.60]  But here I am.
[2853.60 --> 2860.60]  And I work with the, as the candidacy director, I work with the candidacy committee, which is nine people.
[2860.60 --> 2861.60]  All volunteer.
[2861.60 --> 2868.60]  Wonderful, amazing pastors from around the denomination, United States and Canada, are on this team.
[2868.60 --> 2874.60]  And what we do together is oversee the pathways to ordination in the Christian Reformed Church.
[2874.60 --> 2876.60]  And it's very fun work.
[2876.60 --> 2877.60]  I love my work.
[2877.60 --> 2881.60]  I get to show hospitality to new pastors that are coming in.
[2881.60 --> 2886.60]  I get to orient them to what the Christian Reformed Church is all about.
[2886.60 --> 2893.60]  Advise classist leaders and others about candidacy processes as they come in.
[2893.60 --> 2900.60]  And then what we're most known for, probably, is recommending emerging leaders who come through the processes.
[2900.60 --> 2902.60]  They finish their seminaries.
[2902.60 --> 2905.60]  And then we recommend them to synod for candidacy.
[2905.60 --> 2907.60]  So, that's what we do.
[2907.60 --> 2914.60]  But it's just the tip of the iceberg of what it means to be involved in the work of candidacy.
[2914.60 --> 2923.60]  Your pastor, Chris, is on the CMLT of your classes, which means he works with all these emerging leaders from your area.
[2923.60 --> 2930.60]  He helps support them financially and in all kinds of other ways as they come through.
[2930.60 --> 2934.60]  And we just so appreciate the work that classist leaders like Chris do.
[2934.60 --> 2943.60]  And actually, every single one of you probably is involved in the work of candidacy even more than I am.
[2943.60 --> 2947.60]  Because you are the most important part of the process.
[2947.60 --> 2959.60]  You're the ones that actually identify leaders and encourage them and pray for them and send them kind of on their way towards ministry in the Christian Reformed Church.
[2959.60 --> 2963.60]  So, you've raised up a candidate just recently, Kevin Lobert.
[2963.60 --> 2967.60]  We are so excited that he's almost at the end of his candidacy process.
[2967.60 --> 2972.60]  And he's almost, he's getting so close to ordination after I think it was eight years in the process.
[2972.60 --> 2975.60]  He told me, a long, long time.
[2975.60 --> 2981.60]  And so, I just want to see for a minute how many of you have been involved in the work of candidacy for Kevin.
[2981.60 --> 2988.60]  How many of you have prayed for him or encouraged him throughout that ten years or so that he's been in this process?
[2988.60 --> 2989.60]  Okay.
[2989.60 --> 2991.60]  How many of you have said, Kevin, you're really good at that.
[2991.60 --> 2993.60]  You should try doing some of this.
[2993.60 --> 2994.60]  Anyone?
[2994.60 --> 2995.60]  All right.
[2995.60 --> 2998.60]  How many of you are parents of Kevin?
[2998.60 --> 3002.60]  I had to say that because I sat by the parents of Kevin.
[3002.60 --> 3011.60]  So, all along his life and his wife and his kids that have been making big sacrifices for him to invest the time into his studies.
[3011.60 --> 3014.60]  So, much work even for the family of candidates.
[3014.60 --> 3016.60]  So, I appreciate that.
[3016.60 --> 3019.60]  So, you guys are the ones that have done this.
[3019.60 --> 3025.60]  And then Josh Chamberlain, I found out, is here also and is also working through his MDiv.
[3025.60 --> 3028.60]  And I just talked to his parents this morning, his mom who was up here.
[3028.60 --> 3036.60]  So, any of you who have encouraged Josh or identified gifts in Josh or just said, hey, you know what?
[3036.60 --> 3037.60]  You should get your MDiv.
[3037.60 --> 3043.60]  Any of you here that have done that as well, thank you for the amazing work that you've done in this process.
[3043.60 --> 3048.60]  The candidacy committee and me were just like the salt shaker.
[3048.60 --> 3051.60]  But you guys are the ones that put the salt in the shaker.
[3051.60 --> 3054.60]  And we're so, so thankful that you've done that work.
[3054.60 --> 3061.60]  Luke 10 verse 2 says that the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.
[3061.60 --> 3068.60]  And so, we're supposed to, Jesus said, pray for the Lord of the harvest to send laborers into his harvest field.
[3068.60 --> 3074.60]  And the laborers going into the harvest field, of course, are not just pastors.
[3074.60 --> 3077.60]  It's all of these that are going to Mexico.
[3077.60 --> 3083.60]  All of you, as you go into your jobs and you're a light and a witness for the kingdom, you're all laborers.
[3083.60 --> 3090.60]  But this particular role of laborer, the pastor who's supposed to equip and encourage everybody else,
[3090.60 --> 3094.60]  you guys have been really instrumental also in doing that.
[3094.60 --> 3101.60]  So, if you would mind joining me in prayer, the candidacy committee has been praying.
[3101.60 --> 3105.60]  We set our alarms on our phones for 10-02.
[3105.60 --> 3114.60]  And every 10-02 every day, we stop when the alarm goes and we pray for the Lord of the harvest to send laborers into his harvest field.
[3114.60 --> 3115.60]  Luke 10-02.
[3115.60 --> 3119.60]  So, if any of you want to do that, we would sure love it.
[3119.60 --> 3125.60]  And if you would also just continue what you're doing, investing in leaders, encouraging and blessing people.
[3125.60 --> 3130.60]  And also, thank you for the ministry shares that you give to the Christian Reformed Church.
[3130.60 --> 3141.60]  That's one way that your church can do broader work to equip and help and resource all the other churches that we're in covenant with together.
[3141.60 --> 3144.60]  So, thank you, thank you, thank you for your continued faithful support.
[3144.60 --> 3146.60]  I'm so thankful for that.
[3146.60 --> 3151.60]  Would you mind just joining me in prayer for a minute in that Luke 10-02 prayer?
[3151.60 --> 3155.60]  Lord Jesus, you are the Lord of the harvest.
[3155.60 --> 3161.60]  Lord, you know that throughout this world, there are people that you're drawing into your kingdom.
[3161.60 --> 3172.60]  There's people in our neighborhoods, in our workplaces, in our families, that desperately need to hear that you love them and that Christ has died for them.
[3172.60 --> 3175.60]  And that their sins can be forgiven, Lord.
[3175.60 --> 3180.60]  There's people just weighed down with the burden of their sin and not knowing what to do with it.
[3180.60 --> 3189.60]  So, we pray, Lord, that you would make us those laborers, that you'd open up conversations, help us to see ourselves as missionaries in every place we go.
[3189.60 --> 3207.60]  And Lord, we pray also that you'd raise up this specific kind of laborer, these ministers of the gospel that are willing to equip and teach and serve as pastors in churches and maybe plant churches or do other kinds of ministry, full-time ministry work.
[3207.60 --> 3210.60]  We do pray that you would continue to raise them up.
[3210.60 --> 3216.60]  And Lord, continue to use this congregation as you've been doing to raise up those laborers.
[3216.60 --> 3220.60]  I'm so, so thankful for the work that you're doing in them.
[3220.60 --> 3223.60]  And we pray all this in Jesus' name. Amen.
[3223.60 --> 3224.60]  Good morning.
[3224.60 --> 3225.60]  My name is Dave.
[3225.60 --> 3230.60]  I am one of the elders for this church.
[3230.60 --> 3247.60]  Two announcements before I begin in our church family prayer.
[3247.60 --> 3250.60]  Robin Bauman has asked us to announce.
[3250.60 --> 3255.60]  Some of us already know this news that Michaela Chamberlain is engaged.
[3255.60 --> 3259.60]  So, we'll pray for her and for Caden for many happy years together.
[3259.60 --> 3260.60]  And some news.
[3260.60 --> 3263.60]  We've been praying for Tessa for a while.
[3263.60 --> 3267.60]  She has gone through a battery of tests with more to come this week.
[3267.60 --> 3271.60]  B-cell lymphoma has been confirmed, but not the type.
[3271.60 --> 3274.60]  So much is yet unknown.
[3274.60 --> 3276.60]  We wait for further test results.
[3276.60 --> 3283.60]  So, we pray for her, for endurance, for patience, and understanding what the next steps are.
[3283.60 --> 3286.60]  Let us pray.
[3286.60 --> 3292.60]  The heavens declare the glory of God.
[3292.60 --> 3294.60]  The skies proclaim the work of his hands.
[3294.60 --> 3296.60]  Day after day, they pour forth speech.
[3296.60 --> 3299.60]  Night after night, they reveal knowledge.
[3299.60 --> 3300.60]  They have no speech.
[3300.60 --> 3301.60]  They use no words.
[3301.60 --> 3303.60]  No sound is heard from them.
[3303.60 --> 3305.60]  Yet their voice goes out into all the earth.
[3305.60 --> 3308.60]  Their words to the ends of the earth.
[3308.60 --> 3311.60]  Father, it is very good that we gather on this Lord's Day.
[3311.60 --> 3316.60]  It is a time that we join with the church everywhere and rejoice in your name.
[3316.60 --> 3321.60]  Father, we confess that even though we focus our thoughts on you each Sunday,
[3321.60 --> 3324.60]  our thoughts stray throughout the busyness of the week.
[3324.60 --> 3328.60]  We confess that there are things that we have done that we should not have,
[3328.60 --> 3331.60]  and things that we should have done but did not.
[3331.60 --> 3336.60]  We confess that there are things that we have said and things that we should have said.
[3336.60 --> 3340.60]  Father, we feel the same frustration as the Apostle Paul.
[3340.60 --> 3343.60]  I do not understand what I do.
[3343.60 --> 3346.60]  For what I want to do, I do not do.
[3346.60 --> 3348.60]  But what I hate, I do.
[3348.60 --> 3352.60]  Father, we thank you that we do not have to feel burdened by our sin.
[3352.60 --> 3357.60]  For it has been nailed to the cross, and we don't have to be burdened by it anymore.
[3357.60 --> 3361.60]  Father, we come to you because we have so many reasons to be thankful.
[3361.60 --> 3366.60]  Not long ago, we had a chance to experience some winter weather and to enjoy your creation.
[3366.60 --> 3369.60]  We thank you for the variety of seasons we get to experience.
[3369.60 --> 3372.60]  And like that first week of creation, it is very good.
[3372.60 --> 3375.60]  We thank you for this church family and everyone who has gathered here.
[3375.60 --> 3377.60]  We thank you for the leadership of this church.
[3377.60 --> 3389.60]  For Chris, for Kevin, for Josh, for members of council.
[3389.60 --> 3396.60]  We pray for Kevin as he is finishing off his work and completing the steps in need for candidacy.
[3396.60 --> 3400.60]  We pray that all of that will fall into place and go very well.
[3400.60 --> 3403.60]  We pray for the many ministries of this church.
[3403.60 --> 3409.60]  We ask that you bless the work that they do, that they may meet the spiritual and physical needs that we see around us.
[3409.60 --> 3413.60]  We thank you that we had the opportunity to commission our Mexico missions team.
[3413.60 --> 3417.60]  We thank you that so much organization and funding has fallen into place.
[3417.60 --> 3420.60]  We pray that everything about this trip will go very well.
[3420.60 --> 3426.60]  That they will be able to be an effective witness to the people around them.
[3426.60 --> 3431.60]  Father, as a church community, we thank you the joys and needs that we have.
[3431.60 --> 3435.60]  We pray for Ann Marie Van Muen who will have open heart surgery.
[3435.60 --> 3438.60]  Be with the healthcare professionals who will be taking care of her.
[3438.60 --> 3440.60]  And we pray for her recovery.
[3440.60 --> 3444.60]  We thank you that Lena Chepkama's health is improving.
[3444.60 --> 3447.60]  We pray that she will be able to go home soon.
[3447.60 --> 3455.60]  We pray for John Van Bergkijk who has been diagnosed with non-invasive bladder cancer and is expecting treatment soon.
[3455.60 --> 3458.60]  We pray for your healing and for your peace.
[3458.60 --> 3461.60]  Father, we pray for Tessa.
[3461.60 --> 3468.60]  We hear the news that she is experiencing B-cell lymphoma and there are more tests to come.
[3468.60 --> 3476.60]  Father, we pray that these tests will give more knowledge and more insight about her condition and what may happen next.
[3476.60 --> 3478.60]  We pray for patience.
[3478.60 --> 3480.60]  We pray for endurance.
[3480.60 --> 3485.60]  We pray for all of her family and her friends who must walk with her on this difficult journey.
[3485.60 --> 3494.60]  We pray for Amanda Hogawone's sister and Klaus Tessamacher's daughter, Tanya, who are experiencing stage 4 cancer.
[3494.60 --> 3501.60]  We pray that they, their families, may feel your comfort, peace, healing, and hope.
[3501.60 --> 3506.60]  We pray for those who are struggling with addictions, both physical and psychological.
[3506.60 --> 3512.60]  We pray for families who have been impacted, that they may be able to make good decisions and feel your strength.
[3512.60 --> 3517.60]  Father, we pray for those who struggle with their mental health and find winter difficult.
[3517.60 --> 3521.60]  We pray for those who need relief for their depression and anxiety.
[3521.60 --> 3525.60]  Father, we thank you for the good news about Michaela's engagement to Caden.
[3525.60 --> 3531.60]  We pray that with all the work and busyness of planning for our wedding, that it will be a good time to celebrate,
[3531.60 --> 3536.60]  but more importantly, that it will be a start to a very long and happy life together.
[3536.60 --> 3545.60]  And Father, we pray for Pastor Chris as he leads us again in the study of your word, as revealed to Paul's letter to the Thessalonians.
[3545.60 --> 3550.60]  We pray that the message of love and a quiet life is one that will reach each of us.
[3550.60 --> 3556.60]  Father, may these words of our mouths and the meditation of our hearts be pleasing in your sight.
[3556.60 --> 3559.60]  O Lord, our rock and our redeemer.
[3559.60 --> 3560.60]  Come Lord Jesus.
[3560.60 --> 3561.60]  Amen.
[3566.60 --> 3584.60]  We here at Emmanuel are in the middle of a series in the books of Thessalonians.
[3584.60 --> 3593.60]  We're going to continue our close look at Thessalonians this morning by reading together from 1 Thessalonians 4, verse 9 through 12.
[3593.60 --> 3596.60]  The first time through, it will be on the screen behind me.
[3596.60 --> 3604.60]  But of course, I encourage you to open up a Bible or have your device and your Bible app turned to 1 Thessalonians 4.
[3604.60 --> 3608.60]  If you'd like a Bible to hold on to, there's some at the back in the little ladder shelves there.
[3608.60 --> 3610.60]  You can grab one of those.
[3610.60 --> 3615.60]  Let's start by reading together this text from 1 Thessalonians 4.
[3615.60 --> 3618.60]  We'll begin at verse 9.
[3618.60 --> 3637.60]  In verses 10, verse 10 through 7, verse 10.
[3637.60 --> 3656.50]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3662.50 --> 3665.02]  So I wonder if you'll permit me.
[3665.02 --> 3670.32]  Let's do a little bit of a survey here, a question for you.
[3671.22 --> 3673.92]  And when I ask you a question, I'm inviting you to give a response.
[3674.50 --> 3677.74]  Okay, this is not one of those passive moments where the pastor talks at you.
[3678.58 --> 3678.96]  Together.
[3680.44 --> 3684.02]  Who is the backbone of the church?
[3686.84 --> 3687.24]  Jesus.
[3687.44 --> 3688.86]  I'm glad we started with that one.
[3688.94 --> 3692.04]  That's, of course, the absolutely right answer.
[3692.04 --> 3694.34]  But how does Jesus make himself known among us?
[3694.34 --> 3696.16]  Who's the backbone of the church?
[3698.10 --> 3698.62]  Sorry?
[3699.46 --> 3700.36]  His people.
[3700.56 --> 3700.80]  Okay.
[3701.36 --> 3703.40]  Let's get a little bit more specific.
[3705.76 --> 3708.68]  Without whom would the ministry of the church not happen?
[3709.82 --> 3710.90]  The Holy Spirit.
[3711.02 --> 3713.22]  Oh, see, you guys are even better than I thought.
[3713.28 --> 3713.54]  Okay.
[3714.08 --> 3714.58]  Keep going.
[3716.26 --> 3717.68]  Josh Chamberlain.
[3718.42 --> 3718.94]  Excellent.
[3718.94 --> 3719.22]  Excellent.
[3720.40 --> 3723.18]  Yeah, there's about 3% for whom that is true.
[3724.34 --> 3725.54]  Okay.
[3725.64 --> 3726.22]  Anyone else?
[3728.78 --> 3729.18]  Pastor.
[3729.34 --> 3729.76]  Thanks, Mom.
[3732.74 --> 3733.72]  Yeah, pastor.
[3733.90 --> 3734.84]  That's unanswered.
[3734.90 --> 3736.64]  But I don't think that's the answer I'm looking for.
[3737.76 --> 3738.52]  The people.
[3738.86 --> 3739.70]  What about the people?
[3741.16 --> 3741.32]  Sorry.
[3742.48 --> 3743.26]  Sheila, did you?
[3743.88 --> 3744.78]  No, not there.
[3744.94 --> 3745.82]  Someone back there then.
[3746.66 --> 3747.38]  Sheila was terrified.
[3747.52 --> 3748.06]  I called on her.
[3749.24 --> 3749.54]  Sorry?
[3749.54 --> 3749.62]  Sorry?
[3749.62 --> 3750.80]  The Bible study group.
[3750.80 --> 3752.48]  The Bible study group.
[3752.62 --> 3753.10]  All right.
[3753.16 --> 3753.42]  All right.
[3753.48 --> 3754.12]  We're getting there.
[3756.12 --> 3756.72]  Counsel.
[3757.62 --> 3758.74]  Oh, man.
[3758.82 --> 3760.76]  There's a guy who understands ecclesiology.
[3761.28 --> 3761.98]  But no.
[3763.42 --> 3764.40]  Each of us.
[3764.50 --> 3765.04]  Thank you.
[3765.94 --> 3766.78]  Each of us.
[3766.96 --> 3768.44]  Here's what I want to suggest to you.
[3768.44 --> 3777.72]  The backbone of this church and of any church are the people who quietly serve without title,
[3778.42 --> 3780.72]  without fanfare, without reward.
[3780.72 --> 3785.00]  I get thanked all the time.
[3786.00 --> 3787.44]  And I'm grateful for your gratitude.
[3788.90 --> 3792.92]  But it is the people who make coffee on Sunday.
[3794.42 --> 3795.54]  And sometimes it's okay.
[3797.32 --> 3799.12]  That feed the life of this church.
[3800.10 --> 3805.58]  It's the people who come in the middle of the week to tidy up a room without being asked.
[3805.58 --> 3811.22]  It's the people who serve on this committee or that committee, like the finance committee,
[3811.76 --> 3814.78]  and just do so for years and years and years.
[3815.74 --> 3821.66]  The people who quietly serve without any recognition or reward.
[3821.96 --> 3828.58]  Without them, this church wouldn't function at near the capacity it does.
[3829.38 --> 3831.16]  And so, yeah, Josh, he's awesome.
[3831.16 --> 3841.32]  But he needs all y'all to do the work of the church so that we can do and be who God is calling us to be.
[3843.20 --> 3848.00]  But it's really hard, isn't it, to be an unsung servant.
[3849.30 --> 3855.98]  It's really hard to quietly persist in the work that God has called you to do.
[3855.98 --> 3864.30]  And yet, some of the greatest testimonies of God's love for his church have been shown to me
[3864.30 --> 3868.26]  by the people who serve it without asking for a thank you.
[3869.12 --> 3874.62]  By the people who serve it without looking for recognition and who just do it.
[3875.82 --> 3878.76]  And so for you who serve, thank you.
[3879.40 --> 3884.64]  For you who live in this way and serve in this church and the broader church, thank you.
[3884.64 --> 3892.06]  You are an example for us of what I believe this text is showing us mission looks like.
[3893.18 --> 3898.58]  The banner that I want to operate under this morning, the big idea for us,
[3898.70 --> 3906.80]  is that loving others and living quietly are compelling acts of mission in the world.
[3906.80 --> 3912.74]  Now this is sort of a part two from a message that we began two weeks ago.
[3913.24 --> 3916.74]  Last week, Pastor Kevin led us in our Cadet Sunday service,
[3916.74 --> 3919.58]  so we took a little interlude from our look at Thessalonians.
[3919.88 --> 3925.68]  But we're picking up after the first part of chapter four, where we looked at verses one through eight.
[3926.26 --> 3929.78]  And if your Bibles are open, you'll see really quickly that in some sense,
[3929.78 --> 3935.54]  the first part presents a sort of negative example, something that we should avoid,
[3935.74 --> 3937.28]  something that we should flee from.
[3937.76 --> 3942.88]  And the second part, where we are today, is kind of a positive example.
[3943.00 --> 3944.56]  That is something we should run towards.
[3944.92 --> 3947.88]  A way of being in the world that we should strive after.
[3949.18 --> 3957.12]  Paul explains that striving towards the way we should be in the world as loving one another.
[3957.12 --> 3961.66]  Right? He says, you yourselves have been taught by God to love each other.
[3962.12 --> 3966.14]  And in fact, you love all of God's family throughout Macedonia.
[3967.36 --> 3973.02]  In this kind of love for one another, for Christians around the world,
[3973.14 --> 3979.14]  this kind of love for one another that we see on display here so often and so regularly,
[3979.40 --> 3981.90]  that's what we are called to grow in.
[3982.48 --> 3983.74]  Right? Paul says in verse 10,
[3983.74 --> 4000.36]  And if you recall, that more and more ties this section with the previous section that we looked at.
[4000.62 --> 4002.32]  Right? We looked at it two weeks ago.
[4002.42 --> 4003.68]  Verse one says,
[4003.68 --> 4021.62]  The first part that we looked at a couple weeks ago is our service and love and worship of God.
[4021.86 --> 4027.14]  And the second part, where we're looking today, is our service and love for others.
[4027.14 --> 4032.06]  And keep those two parts in mind because we'll return to that idea in a moment.
[4032.34 --> 4037.72]  To begin, I want to jump in and look at that phrase from the beginning there,
[4037.78 --> 4039.88]  that phrase, taught by God.
[4040.92 --> 4042.10]  Right? Paul says,
[4042.26 --> 4045.78]  You yourselves have been taught by God to love each other.
[4047.42 --> 4051.98]  That phrase, taught by God, is from the Old Testament prophets.
[4051.98 --> 4058.68]  And it was used to talk about the kingdom of God and the restoration of God's chosen people.
[4059.34 --> 4064.66]  For example, Isaiah writes some 800 years before Paul and before Jesus.
[4064.92 --> 4067.48]  He writes in Isaiah 54, 13,
[4068.16 --> 4072.66]  All your children will be taught by the Lord and great will be their peace.
[4073.72 --> 4077.90]  In the prophet Micah, this vision of the kingdom is expanded even further.
[4077.90 --> 4079.18]  Micah says,
[4079.18 --> 4081.30]  Many nations will come and will say,
[4081.80 --> 4086.00]  Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the temple of the God of Jacob.
[4086.28 --> 4091.26]  He will teach us his ways so that we may walk in his paths.
[4092.84 --> 4098.50]  Taught by God is a particular new covenant language.
[4099.18 --> 4106.36]  It's language that has been fueling the hope of redemption and salvation of God's people for centuries.
[4106.36 --> 4109.62]  That's what we mean when we say new covenant language.
[4109.96 --> 4113.12]  And Paul's use of it here is a way of saying,
[4113.62 --> 4114.48]  This is happening.
[4115.20 --> 4116.56]  This is being fulfilled.
[4117.56 --> 4118.02]  Right?
[4118.06 --> 4121.26]  You have this predominantly Greek church in Thessalonica
[4121.26 --> 4126.88]  being shown to be part of the fulfillment of God's covenant plan for the whole world.
[4128.20 --> 4131.06]  Now, that is already pretty cool, I think.
[4131.82 --> 4132.94]  But there's more.
[4132.94 --> 4137.94]  Because Jesus uses this same new covenant language.
[4138.94 --> 4139.16]  Right?
[4139.24 --> 4140.32]  Being taught by God.
[4140.70 --> 4143.10]  And he applies it to himself and to his teaching.
[4144.14 --> 4145.30]  Look at John 6.
[4146.06 --> 4146.88]  John 6.
[4147.58 --> 4148.38]  Jesus says,
[4148.54 --> 4149.86]  It's written in the prophets.
[4150.06 --> 4151.42]  They will be taught by God.
[4151.82 --> 4152.62]  Now, we can say,
[4152.74 --> 4153.72]  Yes, we know that.
[4153.80 --> 4154.58]  We heard that.
[4154.64 --> 4155.48]  We've seen it in Isaiah.
[4155.62 --> 4156.36]  We've seen it in Micah.
[4156.44 --> 4157.64]  It also appears in Jeremiah.
[4157.90 --> 4159.98]  For the keener students among us this morning.
[4159.98 --> 4162.08]  They will be taught by God.
[4162.30 --> 4162.86]  Jesus says,
[4163.26 --> 4167.24]  Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me.
[4168.16 --> 4171.34]  No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God.
[4171.68 --> 4173.68]  Only he has seen the Father.
[4174.96 --> 4177.04]  Effectively, Jesus is saying,
[4177.46 --> 4179.74]  God's teaching, the Father's teaching,
[4179.88 --> 4182.54]  and my teaching are one and the same thing.
[4182.54 --> 4185.38]  This is Jesus saying,
[4186.02 --> 4189.48]  If you are taught by me,
[4189.72 --> 4191.06]  you're taught by God.
[4191.86 --> 4195.38]  It's a similar thing to what Jesus says in John 10, verse 30,
[4195.58 --> 4196.16]  where he says,
[4196.26 --> 4197.86]  I and the Father are one.
[4199.54 --> 4202.06]  And so here in Thessalonians, in our letter,
[4202.20 --> 4207.12]  you have new covenant language about the redemption reality being for all people,
[4207.22 --> 4209.38]  for every tribe, tongue, and nation,
[4209.38 --> 4214.08]  because of the redemption reality of Jesus being God
[4214.08 --> 4218.56]  and showing us what the covenant of grace was always already about.
[4219.26 --> 4220.90]  Showing us, right,
[4221.02 --> 4224.58]  Jesus accomplishing in our place what we could never do.
[4225.96 --> 4227.84]  Not only because he is man,
[4228.00 --> 4231.26]  but precisely because he is God.
[4231.80 --> 4234.68]  The Father and I are one, says Jesus.
[4234.68 --> 4237.94]  Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.
[4238.40 --> 4241.84]  My teachings are the teachings of God.
[4243.08 --> 4246.68]  Which again, I think, is already so cool.
[4247.68 --> 4248.78]  But can you guess it?
[4249.86 --> 4251.00]  There's still more.
[4251.72 --> 4252.70]  This goes even further.
[4253.70 --> 4256.38]  In 1 John 2, verse 27, we read,
[4256.38 --> 4259.52]  His anointing teaches you about all things,
[4259.64 --> 4262.76]  and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit,
[4263.20 --> 4266.66]  just as he taught you, remain in him.
[4268.24 --> 4270.20]  So in context, right,
[4270.26 --> 4275.54]  his anointing refers to Jesus anointing those who would believe
[4275.54 --> 4278.12]  that he is the Christ and that he comes from the Father.
[4279.12 --> 4280.62]  The question remains, right,
[4280.62 --> 4285.96]  who or what is doing this anointing?
[4286.58 --> 4289.94]  Now that answer comes in verse 20 in 1 John,
[4290.10 --> 4290.84]  where we read,
[4291.02 --> 4294.00]  You have an anointing from the Holy One.
[4295.38 --> 4298.64]  The use of anointing language and Holy One
[4298.64 --> 4302.18]  tells us that John is referencing the work of the Holy Spirit.
[4303.82 --> 4306.24]  And so, to be taught by God,
[4306.70 --> 4309.02]  as Paul says the Thessalonians have been,
[4309.02 --> 4313.08]  is, one, the application of new covenant promises.
[4314.04 --> 4317.78]  It's, two, fulfilled in the person and work of Jesus Christ.
[4318.02 --> 4320.82]  And, three, it is applied by the Holy Spirit
[4320.82 --> 4324.94]  to those who genuinely believe and remain in him.
[4325.10 --> 4327.86]  In short, this is about who we are.
[4328.98 --> 4330.78]  That's why I think this is so cool,
[4331.38 --> 4332.64]  why this matters so much,
[4332.64 --> 4334.22]  because about who we are,
[4334.24 --> 4338.14]  and who we are is directly connected to who God is.
[4339.02 --> 4343.34]  Right, to be taught by God isn't just about ideas or ideals.
[4344.04 --> 4345.64]  Now, it includes that, to be sure,
[4345.72 --> 4346.66]  but there's so much more.
[4346.98 --> 4349.08]  To be taught by God is to be connected
[4349.08 --> 4352.06]  to the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[4352.68 --> 4354.70]  To be taught by God is to be part of
[4354.70 --> 4357.02]  his new covenant relationship to humanity
[4357.02 --> 4358.20]  and to the world.
[4358.28 --> 4361.12]  To be taught by God is about your union with Christ,
[4361.60 --> 4362.84]  transforming who you are
[4362.84 --> 4364.32]  and how you show up in the world.
[4364.32 --> 4366.48]  And that is really cool.
[4367.92 --> 4369.80]  That's just three words from our text.
[4369.90 --> 4371.60]  Can you imagine how long this sermon's going to be?
[4372.98 --> 4374.86]  Actually, in Greek, it's just one word.
[4376.86 --> 4377.38]  Theodidaktos.
[4378.02 --> 4378.92]  Taught by God.
[4380.44 --> 4381.52]  That's who you are.
[4381.52 --> 4385.40]  That's who you are.
[4387.30 --> 4388.50]  And this matters,
[4388.74 --> 4390.32]  not just because it's cool
[4390.32 --> 4392.12]  if you're a nerd word like I am.
[4392.70 --> 4394.74]  This matters because of what it means
[4394.74 --> 4396.64]  and what follows from it.
[4397.40 --> 4400.94]  What really has come before
[4400.94 --> 4402.58]  and transformed you,
[4402.88 --> 4404.34]  what has grounded you
[4404.34 --> 4407.58]  in your identity in Jesus Christ.
[4407.58 --> 4412.90]  Who you are transforms your very nature.
[4415.42 --> 4417.14]  The Bible tells us
[4417.14 --> 4418.72]  that in Christ,
[4419.12 --> 4420.62]  you are a new creation.
[4422.38 --> 4424.10]  And that the calls to obedience
[4424.10 --> 4426.72]  that we experience in this life
[4426.72 --> 4430.38]  aren't given in order to accomplish this new life,
[4430.48 --> 4433.18]  but because Christ has accomplished it for us.
[4433.58 --> 4434.56]  That order matters.
[4435.56 --> 4437.50]  We're not trying to achieve redemption.
[4438.04 --> 4441.68]  Rather, redemption is something we receive from God.
[4442.96 --> 4445.14]  A relationship with a living God
[4445.14 --> 4446.78]  by the life, death, resurrection,
[4446.92 --> 4448.06]  and exaltation of Jesus
[4448.06 --> 4449.34]  applied to you
[4449.34 --> 4450.92]  through the working of the Holy Spirit
[4450.92 --> 4453.34]  in your heart and through your life
[4453.34 --> 4455.72]  is the ground of your identity.
[4457.10 --> 4460.28]  A real, living covenant with God
[4460.28 --> 4462.26]  defines who you are.
[4463.54 --> 4464.16]  And hear this.
[4465.16 --> 4465.96]  This God,
[4466.56 --> 4467.74]  in classical terms,
[4467.82 --> 4468.56]  in theology terms,
[4468.64 --> 4469.48]  is immutable.
[4470.52 --> 4472.00]  It means he is unchanging.
[4472.42 --> 4473.60]  He does not change.
[4473.72 --> 4475.18]  Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[4475.36 --> 4476.76]  today, and forever.
[4478.20 --> 4480.54]  And because God is unchanging,
[4481.12 --> 4482.36]  that means, right,
[4482.46 --> 4483.14]  what you do
[4483.14 --> 4485.10]  and your relationship to him
[4485.10 --> 4487.44]  is ultimately unchangeable.
[4487.44 --> 4489.86]  as you have this security
[4489.86 --> 4492.50]  because it's rooted in the very character,
[4493.04 --> 4494.90]  the very being of who God is.
[4494.90 --> 4497.82]  What God has genuinely done in you
[4497.82 --> 4499.22]  cannot be undone.
[4501.22 --> 4501.86]  Now,
[4502.58 --> 4504.74]  this is where I need you to lean in
[4504.74 --> 4506.82]  and I need you to hear this.
[4506.82 --> 4510.08]  This is the beauty
[4510.08 --> 4511.76]  of the gospel reality.
[4514.00 --> 4514.76]  And especially,
[4515.04 --> 4515.26]  maybe,
[4515.46 --> 4516.74]  if you're young.
[4517.50 --> 4517.62]  Right?
[4517.66 --> 4519.36]  Maybe some of you are teenagers.
[4519.94 --> 4520.02]  Right?
[4520.06 --> 4521.52]  So much of your life right now
[4521.52 --> 4522.82]  is about figuring out
[4522.82 --> 4523.62]  who you are.
[4524.78 --> 4526.64]  About what it means to be you
[4526.64 --> 4527.74]  in this moment,
[4527.94 --> 4528.66]  in this life.
[4528.94 --> 4530.10]  And developmentally,
[4530.26 --> 4531.06]  that tracks.
[4531.58 --> 4531.72]  Right?
[4532.06 --> 4532.54]  Developmentally,
[4532.94 --> 4534.46]  teenagers are trying on
[4534.46 --> 4535.48]  different identities,
[4536.06 --> 4536.90]  different relationships
[4536.90 --> 4537.60]  to the world.
[4538.10 --> 4538.44]  That's why,
[4538.54 --> 4539.52]  if you parent a teenager,
[4539.68 --> 4540.36]  sometimes you're like,
[4540.46 --> 4541.20]  who are you?
[4541.44 --> 4542.62]  Who is this kid?
[4543.36 --> 4544.30]  Where's my nice,
[4544.58 --> 4546.16]  pleasant daughter?
[4546.94 --> 4547.10]  Well,
[4547.10 --> 4548.06]  she's trying on something new.
[4548.26 --> 4548.98]  I'm not talking about
[4548.98 --> 4549.80]  personal experience here,
[4549.86 --> 4550.02]  okay?
[4550.06 --> 4550.64]  Don't tell Nora.
[4552.32 --> 4553.36]  But this is normal.
[4553.46 --> 4554.66]  This is what happens.
[4555.04 --> 4555.16]  Right?
[4555.24 --> 4556.42]  You're trying to figure out
[4556.42 --> 4557.40]  who you are
[4557.40 --> 4558.44]  and what feels right.
[4559.48 --> 4560.14]  One week,
[4560.20 --> 4561.10]  you're really into anime.
[4561.44 --> 4562.20]  The next week,
[4562.26 --> 4563.72]  you want to be a river surfer.
[4565.18 --> 4565.44]  See,
[4565.50 --> 4566.68]  someone sees a logical connection
[4566.68 --> 4567.30]  between those two
[4567.30 --> 4567.94]  because I didn't.
[4569.38 --> 4569.54]  Right?
[4570.18 --> 4571.60]  Even as that's happening
[4571.60 --> 4572.32]  in your life,
[4572.42 --> 4574.38]  there's no more secure foundation
[4574.38 --> 4576.02]  for you to enter into
[4576.02 --> 4577.32]  that situation
[4577.32 --> 4578.44]  and to try to figure
[4578.44 --> 4579.22]  all that out
[4579.22 --> 4580.80]  than on the one
[4580.80 --> 4582.12]  that undergirds it all,
[4582.24 --> 4583.06]  Christ Jesus.
[4584.74 --> 4584.94]  Now,
[4585.00 --> 4585.64]  this is also true
[4585.64 --> 4586.20]  for those of us
[4586.20 --> 4587.04]  who are a little bit older.
[4587.78 --> 4587.98]  Right?
[4587.98 --> 4588.96]  Maybe in terms of
[4588.96 --> 4590.14]  a major transition
[4590.14 --> 4591.08]  in your life.
[4591.80 --> 4592.70]  Maybe you're finishing
[4592.70 --> 4593.24]  university
[4593.24 --> 4594.44]  and you're wondering
[4594.44 --> 4595.06]  what's next.
[4595.82 --> 4596.84]  Maybe you've decided
[4596.84 --> 4597.62]  to quit a job
[4597.62 --> 4598.10]  that you've had
[4598.10 --> 4598.82]  for 10 years
[4598.82 --> 4599.44]  or 20 years
[4599.44 --> 4600.44]  and you've got
[4600.44 --> 4601.08]  no idea
[4601.08 --> 4602.10]  what's coming up next.
[4603.42 --> 4603.78]  Right?
[4603.82 --> 4604.44]  You've got to reinvent
[4604.44 --> 4605.38]  your entire life,
[4606.04 --> 4606.88]  your social groups
[4606.88 --> 4608.02]  and the like.
[4609.08 --> 4610.62]  Maybe you're a little bit older
[4610.62 --> 4611.12]  and your kids
[4611.12 --> 4612.16]  are moving out this year
[4612.16 --> 4614.76]  and you have no idea
[4614.76 --> 4616.12]  how marriage
[4616.12 --> 4617.12]  to that man
[4617.12 --> 4617.82]  or that woman
[4617.82 --> 4618.76]  is going to be
[4618.76 --> 4619.64]  without a buffer
[4619.64 --> 4620.92]  of those teenagers
[4620.92 --> 4621.46]  in your house.
[4623.42 --> 4624.34]  Maybe retirement
[4624.34 --> 4624.96]  is approaching
[4624.96 --> 4626.50]  and you don't know
[4626.50 --> 4626.90]  what that's going
[4626.90 --> 4627.46]  to mean for you.
[4628.12 --> 4629.02]  Who are you
[4629.02 --> 4630.44]  apart from your work?
[4631.86 --> 4632.00]  Right?
[4632.00 --> 4632.96]  The same is true here.
[4633.84 --> 4635.28]  There is no stronger
[4635.28 --> 4636.06]  foundation
[4636.06 --> 4637.32]  into which
[4637.32 --> 4638.16]  we can enter
[4638.16 --> 4639.14]  the chaoses
[4639.14 --> 4640.34]  of these transitions
[4640.34 --> 4641.84]  than our fixed,
[4642.28 --> 4642.48]  rooted,
[4642.76 --> 4643.48]  and immutable
[4643.48 --> 4644.24]  identity
[4644.24 --> 4645.70]  in Jesus Christ.
[4646.70 --> 4647.70]  There is nothing
[4647.70 --> 4648.78]  that can separate you
[4648.78 --> 4649.70]  from the love of God
[4649.70 --> 4650.38]  that is available
[4650.38 --> 4651.54]  in Christ Jesus
[4651.54 --> 4652.06]  our Lord.
[4652.34 --> 4654.64]  This is who you are
[4654.64 --> 4655.58]  and someone needs
[4655.58 --> 4656.16]  to say amen.
[4658.00 --> 4659.48]  This is part of what it means
[4659.48 --> 4660.62]  to be taught by God.
[4662.86 --> 4663.98]  But at this point,
[4664.76 --> 4665.50]  it won't surprise you
[4665.50 --> 4665.86]  to learn
[4665.86 --> 4667.46]  there's still more.
[4668.56 --> 4669.70]  There's still more awesome
[4669.70 --> 4671.58]  in this text.
[4672.78 --> 4674.20]  The Old Testament prophets
[4674.20 --> 4675.76]  say of the new covenant
[4675.76 --> 4677.64]  that the law of God
[4677.64 --> 4678.24]  will be written
[4678.24 --> 4680.12]  on your hearts.
[4681.16 --> 4682.30]  Jesus says effectively
[4682.30 --> 4683.28]  the same thing, right?
[4683.32 --> 4684.64]  He summarizes the law
[4684.64 --> 4685.60]  by saying
[4685.60 --> 4686.72]  the first and greatest
[4686.72 --> 4687.58]  commandment is this,
[4687.66 --> 4688.88]  to love the Lord your God
[4688.88 --> 4689.42]  with all your heart,
[4689.50 --> 4689.94]  with all your soul,
[4690.02 --> 4690.54]  with all your mind,
[4690.58 --> 4691.26]  and with all your strength.
[4691.70 --> 4693.70]  And the second is like it,
[4693.76 --> 4694.84]  to love your neighbor
[4694.84 --> 4696.18]  as yourself.
[4699.00 --> 4699.96]  Jesus says again,
[4701.08 --> 4701.80]  a new command
[4701.80 --> 4703.20]  I give you
[4703.20 --> 4704.54]  that you love
[4704.54 --> 4705.56]  one another.
[4706.36 --> 4707.04]  By this,
[4707.48 --> 4708.40]  they will know
[4708.40 --> 4709.96]  that you are my disciples
[4709.96 --> 4710.92]  if you love
[4710.92 --> 4712.02]  one another.
[4713.56 --> 4713.94]  And again,
[4714.02 --> 4715.26]  in 1 John 3,
[4715.46 --> 4715.86]  we read,
[4716.22 --> 4717.06]  this is the message
[4717.06 --> 4718.06]  you heard from the beginning.
[4718.26 --> 4719.00]  We should love
[4719.00 --> 4719.90]  one another.
[4720.12 --> 4721.32]  This is the command
[4721.32 --> 4722.04]  to believe
[4722.04 --> 4722.76]  in the name
[4722.76 --> 4723.32]  of his Son,
[4723.40 --> 4723.98]  Jesus Christ,
[4724.12 --> 4725.02]  and to love
[4725.02 --> 4725.56]  one another
[4725.56 --> 4727.52]  as he had commanded us.
[4728.46 --> 4729.34]  This whole section
[4729.34 --> 4729.80]  of text
[4729.80 --> 4730.80]  is under the banner
[4730.80 --> 4731.52]  of loving
[4731.52 --> 4732.28]  one another.
[4732.36 --> 4732.80]  It begins,
[4732.94 --> 4733.10]  right?
[4733.16 --> 4733.66]  We look at it
[4733.66 --> 4734.16]  in verse 9,
[4734.44 --> 4735.64]  now about your love
[4735.64 --> 4736.52]  for one another.
[4737.72 --> 4738.26]  And in Greek,
[4738.36 --> 4738.82]  it's a little bit
[4738.82 --> 4740.36]  more particular there.
[4740.54 --> 4740.78]  It says,
[4741.08 --> 4742.46]  now about Philadelphia.
[4744.14 --> 4746.34]  Now about brotherly love.
[4748.14 --> 4748.76]  Now interestingly,
[4749.14 --> 4749.60]  that word,
[4749.74 --> 4750.20]  Philadelphia,
[4750.70 --> 4752.34]  is used only a handful
[4752.34 --> 4752.90]  of times
[4752.90 --> 4754.04]  outside of the Bible,
[4754.04 --> 4756.26]  but it is always used
[4756.26 --> 4757.64]  outside of the Bible
[4757.64 --> 4758.24]  in reference
[4758.24 --> 4759.20]  to families
[4759.20 --> 4761.52]  and the love
[4761.52 --> 4762.64]  that someone has
[4762.64 --> 4764.42]  for their family.
[4765.46 --> 4765.98]  Now family
[4765.98 --> 4767.14]  was defined
[4767.14 --> 4767.94]  a little bit bigger
[4767.94 --> 4768.90]  in the ancient world
[4768.90 --> 4770.28]  than our nuclear family
[4770.28 --> 4771.72]  with 2.3 kids.
[4772.32 --> 4773.38]  It included
[4773.38 --> 4774.62]  in-laws
[4774.62 --> 4775.52]  and out-laws
[4775.52 --> 4776.34]  and in some cases
[4776.34 --> 4777.32]  included slaves
[4777.32 --> 4778.04]  and the like.
[4778.82 --> 4779.62]  But the way
[4779.62 --> 4780.84]  Paul is using it
[4780.84 --> 4781.92]  is even bigger
[4781.92 --> 4782.52]  and broader
[4782.52 --> 4783.50]  than that.
[4784.56 --> 4785.32]  The gospel
[4785.32 --> 4787.64]  redefines family.
[4788.96 --> 4789.80]  Jesus asks,
[4790.00 --> 4790.84]  who are my mother
[4790.84 --> 4791.52]  and my brothers?
[4792.46 --> 4792.86]  And he says,
[4792.96 --> 4794.08]  those who do the will
[4794.08 --> 4795.40]  of my Father in heaven
[4795.40 --> 4796.64]  are my mother
[4796.64 --> 4797.68]  and brothers.
[4798.52 --> 4799.56]  And we read about it again
[4799.56 --> 4800.12]  over and over
[4800.12 --> 4800.58]  in Romans
[4800.58 --> 4801.44]  and in Galatians
[4801.44 --> 4802.34]  and in Ephesians.
[4802.78 --> 4803.72]  We hear about
[4803.72 --> 4804.40]  our adoption
[4804.40 --> 4806.04]  to sonship.
[4807.10 --> 4807.58]  Where we read
[4807.58 --> 4808.54]  that we are now
[4808.54 --> 4810.76]  all sons of God
[4810.76 --> 4812.42]  and if we're sons of God
[4812.42 --> 4812.94]  that means
[4812.94 --> 4813.58]  we are made
[4813.58 --> 4814.98]  brothers to each other
[4814.98 --> 4815.82]  and of course
[4815.82 --> 4817.68]  brothers includes
[4817.68 --> 4819.38]  and sons includes
[4819.38 --> 4820.66]  daughters and sisters.
[4821.40 --> 4822.94]  We are a new family
[4822.94 --> 4824.60]  because of this identity
[4824.60 --> 4826.40]  in Christ Jesus.
[4826.40 --> 4827.74]  It's the new body
[4827.74 --> 4829.14]  of Christ family
[4829.14 --> 4830.72]  that Paul is encouraging
[4830.72 --> 4831.76]  the Thessalonians
[4831.76 --> 4832.32]  to love
[4832.32 --> 4833.48]  more and more.
[4834.10 --> 4835.00]  And that encouragement
[4835.00 --> 4836.22]  continues down the line
[4836.22 --> 4836.98]  to us today.
[4836.98 --> 4839.34]  And just like
[4839.34 --> 4839.82]  the call
[4839.82 --> 4841.08]  to the Thessalonians
[4841.08 --> 4841.72]  to love
[4841.72 --> 4842.46]  more and more
[4842.46 --> 4843.52]  is based upon
[4843.52 --> 4844.84]  the new identity
[4844.84 --> 4845.82]  they have received
[4845.82 --> 4846.82]  as those taught
[4846.82 --> 4847.52]  by God.
[4847.88 --> 4848.52]  New identity
[4848.52 --> 4849.32]  we have received
[4849.32 --> 4850.48]  because of the gospel.
[4850.80 --> 4851.50]  We too
[4851.50 --> 4852.94]  love each other
[4852.94 --> 4854.28]  more and more
[4854.28 --> 4855.36]  because
[4855.36 --> 4857.38]  of who he is.
[4859.26 --> 4860.32]  And in fact
[4860.32 --> 4864.26]  in this redefined
[4864.26 --> 4865.10]  family
[4865.10 --> 4867.52]  we are closer
[4867.52 --> 4868.92]  with those
[4868.92 --> 4869.62]  who share
[4869.62 --> 4870.72]  the blood of Jesus
[4870.72 --> 4872.84]  than with those
[4872.84 --> 4873.88]  who share
[4873.88 --> 4875.86]  our particular DNA
[4875.86 --> 4877.74]  if they don't believe.
[4879.84 --> 4880.64]  Now I know
[4880.64 --> 4881.22]  that's not really
[4881.22 --> 4881.88]  a kosher thing
[4881.88 --> 4882.22]  to say.
[4882.22 --> 4885.26]  And of course
[4885.26 --> 4885.98]  we pray
[4885.98 --> 4886.64]  that our
[4886.64 --> 4887.76]  biological families
[4887.76 --> 4888.64]  are also part
[4888.64 --> 4889.44]  of the blood-bought
[4889.44 --> 4890.38]  family of God.
[4891.56 --> 4892.70]  But this reality
[4892.70 --> 4893.42]  is also why
[4893.42 --> 4894.18]  it's so hard
[4894.18 --> 4895.06]  in marriages
[4895.06 --> 4895.74]  where one
[4895.74 --> 4896.80]  partner
[4896.80 --> 4898.06]  is a believer
[4898.06 --> 4899.44]  and the other one
[4899.44 --> 4900.04]  even if they're
[4900.04 --> 4900.44]  supportive
[4900.44 --> 4900.98]  is not.
[4902.36 --> 4903.64]  It's just so hard.
[4905.28 --> 4906.16]  It's also why
[4906.16 --> 4907.08]  single people
[4907.08 --> 4908.00]  in the church
[4908.00 --> 4908.72]  sometimes
[4908.72 --> 4909.80]  have so much
[4909.80 --> 4910.26]  trouble.
[4911.56 --> 4911.84]  Whether
[4911.84 --> 4912.52]  you're single
[4912.52 --> 4913.20]  by choice
[4913.20 --> 4914.14]  or by calling
[4914.14 --> 4915.26]  or by circumstance
[4915.26 --> 4916.32]  what so many
[4916.32 --> 4917.26]  of them experience
[4917.26 --> 4918.70]  is a prioritization
[4918.70 --> 4919.72]  of the biological
[4919.72 --> 4920.82]  family
[4920.82 --> 4921.68]  when what
[4921.68 --> 4922.10]  scriptures
[4922.10 --> 4923.10]  are calling us
[4923.10 --> 4923.78]  to is a
[4923.78 --> 4924.78]  redefinition
[4924.78 --> 4925.96]  of the family.
[4927.58 --> 4928.46]  And it's beautiful
[4928.46 --> 4929.16]  to see
[4929.16 --> 4929.90]  villages
[4929.90 --> 4931.00]  raising kids.
[4932.34 --> 4933.16]  To put it bluntly
[4933.16 --> 4934.06]  you guys know
[4934.06 --> 4934.48]  my kids
[4934.48 --> 4935.06]  I'm dependent
[4935.06 --> 4935.82]  on all y'all.
[4936.64 --> 4937.30]  I can't do it
[4937.30 --> 4937.78]  without you.
[4940.52 --> 4941.30]  In fact
[4941.30 --> 4941.88]  as we talk
[4941.88 --> 4942.64]  about covenants
[4942.64 --> 4943.36]  and new covenant
[4943.36 --> 4944.22]  realities
[4944.22 --> 4945.16]  this is the promise
[4945.16 --> 4946.12]  we make at baptism
[4946.12 --> 4946.94]  isn't it?
[4947.64 --> 4948.52]  That we will all
[4948.52 --> 4949.76]  be spiritual parents
[4949.76 --> 4950.48]  to each other's
[4950.48 --> 4950.82]  kids
[4950.82 --> 4951.66]  mentors
[4951.66 --> 4952.66]  and disciples
[4952.66 --> 4955.38]  you are
[4955.38 --> 4956.24]  sanctified
[4956.24 --> 4957.16]  you are set
[4957.16 --> 4957.68]  apart
[4957.68 --> 4958.54]  to love
[4958.54 --> 4959.10]  your new
[4959.10 --> 4959.68]  family
[4959.68 --> 4960.42]  and so
[4960.42 --> 4961.48]  here's the question
[4961.48 --> 4962.90]  how are you
[4962.90 --> 4963.40]  doing at that?
[4963.40 --> 4966.88]  how are you
[4966.88 --> 4967.72]  loving this church?
[4969.26 --> 4970.12]  Sometimes loving
[4970.12 --> 4971.20]  looks like serving
[4971.20 --> 4971.78]  right?
[4971.90 --> 4972.84]  Sometimes love
[4972.84 --> 4973.94]  looks like trusting
[4973.94 --> 4975.14]  trusting
[4975.14 --> 4976.12]  someone with
[4976.12 --> 4976.80]  your hardship
[4976.80 --> 4978.30]  with your brokenness
[4978.30 --> 4978.82]  with the
[4978.82 --> 4979.36]  chaoses
[4979.36 --> 4981.56]  sometimes love
[4981.56 --> 4981.96]  looks like
[4981.96 --> 4982.54]  vulnerability
[4982.54 --> 4985.58]  your love
[4985.58 --> 4986.32]  can look like
[4986.32 --> 4987.16]  a willingness
[4987.16 --> 4988.16]  to be honest
[4988.16 --> 4989.16]  about the
[4989.16 --> 4989.58]  hardships
[4989.58 --> 4991.12]  and the garbage
[4991.12 --> 4991.96]  you're going
[4991.96 --> 4992.28]  through
[4992.28 --> 4994.98]  and your love
[4994.98 --> 4996.24]  can look like
[4996.24 --> 4997.24]  meeting someone
[4997.24 --> 4998.68]  in that place
[4998.68 --> 5000.08]  and sitting
[5000.08 --> 5000.68]  with them
[5000.68 --> 5002.08]  in the brokenness
[5002.08 --> 5003.52]  and encouraging
[5003.52 --> 5004.06]  them
[5004.06 --> 5005.04]  as their heart
[5005.04 --> 5005.56]  falters
[5005.56 --> 5010.08]  but not just
[5010.08 --> 5011.16]  here
[5011.16 --> 5011.78]  right?
[5012.50 --> 5013.32]  Because Paul
[5013.32 --> 5013.84]  says that
[5013.84 --> 5014.54]  this is what
[5014.54 --> 5015.22]  they have been
[5015.22 --> 5015.60]  doing
[5015.60 --> 5016.66]  not only in
[5016.66 --> 5017.20]  their own church
[5017.20 --> 5017.78]  but throughout
[5017.78 --> 5018.58]  Macedonia
[5018.58 --> 5019.50]  there's a sense
[5019.50 --> 5020.10]  in which that
[5020.10 --> 5020.94]  love functioning
[5020.94 --> 5022.00]  here sort of
[5022.00 --> 5022.72]  bubbles up
[5022.72 --> 5023.52]  and spills
[5023.52 --> 5024.04]  over
[5024.04 --> 5024.74]  it blossoms
[5024.74 --> 5025.98]  up to include
[5025.98 --> 5026.78]  Christians
[5026.78 --> 5027.80]  everywhere
[5027.80 --> 5029.76]  brothers and
[5029.76 --> 5030.42]  sisters in
[5030.42 --> 5030.88]  Langley
[5030.88 --> 5031.62]  and in
[5031.62 --> 5032.04]  Canada
[5032.04 --> 5032.94]  and yes
[5032.94 --> 5033.42]  even in
[5033.42 --> 5033.76]  Michigan
[5033.76 --> 5035.80]  throughout
[5035.80 --> 5036.44]  the world
[5036.44 --> 5039.50]  so let me
[5039.50 --> 5040.20]  ask you this
[5040.20 --> 5041.68]  at a time
[5041.68 --> 5042.36]  such as
[5042.36 --> 5042.82]  this
[5042.82 --> 5044.82]  when things
[5044.82 --> 5045.62]  are incredibly
[5045.62 --> 5046.78]  polarized
[5046.78 --> 5048.12]  divided
[5048.12 --> 5049.54]  divisive
[5049.54 --> 5050.22]  not just
[5050.22 --> 5050.76]  in online
[5050.76 --> 5051.24]  spaces
[5051.24 --> 5051.76]  but in
[5051.76 --> 5052.14]  life
[5052.14 --> 5052.86]  spaces
[5052.86 --> 5056.36]  is this
[5056.36 --> 5056.68]  how you're
[5056.68 --> 5057.14]  showing up?
[5058.60 --> 5059.42]  Is this
[5059.42 --> 5060.00]  the love
[5060.00 --> 5060.44]  you're bringing
[5060.44 --> 5060.84]  to your
[5060.84 --> 5061.32]  brothers and
[5061.32 --> 5061.64]  sisters
[5061.64 --> 5062.10]  who maybe
[5062.10 --> 5062.74]  disagree with
[5062.74 --> 5062.90]  you?
[5063.64 --> 5064.38]  Is this
[5064.38 --> 5064.94]  the love
[5064.94 --> 5065.38]  you're bringing
[5065.38 --> 5066.16]  to brothers
[5066.16 --> 5066.58]  and sisters
[5066.58 --> 5067.16]  who are going
[5067.16 --> 5067.98]  through something
[5067.98 --> 5068.60]  right now
[5068.60 --> 5068.90]  that you
[5068.90 --> 5069.62]  maybe only
[5069.62 --> 5070.04]  know a little
[5070.04 --> 5070.42]  bit of
[5070.42 --> 5070.92]  but probably
[5070.92 --> 5071.34]  don't know
[5071.34 --> 5072.00]  near enough
[5072.00 --> 5072.34]  of?
[5073.00 --> 5073.68]  Is this
[5073.68 --> 5074.16]  the love
[5074.16 --> 5074.92]  that's defining
[5074.92 --> 5075.94]  your relationships
[5075.94 --> 5076.86]  with everyone
[5076.86 --> 5077.52]  around here
[5077.52 --> 5077.80]  and with
[5077.80 --> 5078.40]  everyone else
[5078.40 --> 5079.00]  in your
[5079.00 --> 5079.34]  life?
[5083.34 --> 5084.12]  Is this
[5084.12 --> 5084.52]  the kind
[5084.52 --> 5084.90]  of love
[5084.90 --> 5085.24]  that the
[5085.24 --> 5085.58]  church
[5085.58 --> 5086.30]  in the
[5086.30 --> 5086.56]  world
[5086.56 --> 5087.08]  is known
[5087.08 --> 5087.44]  for?
[5090.18 --> 5090.82]  And if
[5090.82 --> 5091.34]  it's not
[5091.34 --> 5093.66]  what can
[5093.66 --> 5094.20]  we do
[5094.20 --> 5095.96]  to paint
[5095.96 --> 5096.22]  a new
[5096.22 --> 5096.58]  picture?
[5097.54 --> 5098.20]  What can
[5098.20 --> 5098.82]  we do
[5098.82 --> 5099.58]  to cast
[5099.58 --> 5099.90]  a new
[5099.90 --> 5100.24]  vision?
[5101.42 --> 5101.76]  And hear
[5101.76 --> 5102.22]  that carefully
[5102.22 --> 5102.44]  right?
[5102.46 --> 5102.76]  I say
[5102.76 --> 5103.18]  we
[5103.18 --> 5104.22]  right?
[5104.30 --> 5104.86]  In verse
[5104.86 --> 5105.44]  11 and
[5105.44 --> 5105.86]  12
[5105.86 --> 5106.86]  make it
[5106.86 --> 5107.24]  your
[5107.24 --> 5107.76]  ambition
[5107.76 --> 5108.22]  to lead
[5108.22 --> 5108.64]  a quiet
[5108.64 --> 5108.98]  life
[5108.98 --> 5109.28]  you should
[5109.28 --> 5109.54]  mind
[5109.54 --> 5109.90]  your own
[5109.90 --> 5110.20]  business
[5110.20 --> 5110.58]  and work
[5110.58 --> 5110.82]  with your
[5110.82 --> 5111.08]  hands
[5111.08 --> 5111.54]  just as we
[5111.54 --> 5112.02]  told you
[5112.02 --> 5112.54]  so that
[5112.54 --> 5113.14]  your daily
[5113.14 --> 5113.76]  life may
[5113.76 --> 5114.12]  win the
[5114.12 --> 5114.68]  respect of
[5114.68 --> 5115.14]  outsiders
[5115.14 --> 5115.62]  and so that
[5115.62 --> 5115.98]  you will
[5115.98 --> 5116.38]  not be
[5116.38 --> 5116.74]  dependent
[5116.74 --> 5117.70]  on anyone
[5117.70 --> 5118.64]  that you
[5118.64 --> 5119.46]  that your
[5119.46 --> 5120.34]  is plural
[5120.34 --> 5122.02]  right?
[5122.08 --> 5122.40]  And so that
[5122.40 --> 5123.08]  turns it from
[5123.08 --> 5123.82]  a mind
[5123.82 --> 5124.42]  your business
[5124.42 --> 5125.20]  to mind
[5125.20 --> 5125.86]  all y'all's
[5125.86 --> 5126.28]  businesses
[5126.28 --> 5126.84]  together
[5126.84 --> 5128.48]  right?
[5128.54 --> 5128.82]  So that
[5128.82 --> 5129.36]  you're not
[5129.36 --> 5129.90]  dependent
[5129.90 --> 5131.40]  because you're
[5131.40 --> 5132.58]  not alone
[5132.58 --> 5135.00]  we're all
[5135.00 --> 5135.88]  in this
[5135.88 --> 5137.04]  together
[5137.04 --> 5138.80]  and is our
[5138.80 --> 5139.42]  love
[5139.42 --> 5140.02]  together
[5140.02 --> 5140.54]  telling
[5140.54 --> 5141.54]  that kind
[5141.54 --> 5142.64]  of story
[5142.64 --> 5143.54]  right?
[5143.58 --> 5144.24]  That mission
[5144.24 --> 5145.14]  that might
[5145.14 --> 5146.16]  daily win
[5146.16 --> 5146.96]  the respect
[5146.96 --> 5148.74]  of outsiders
[5148.74 --> 5148.92]  matters.
[5151.72 --> 5152.92]  It strikes me
[5152.92 --> 5153.78]  right now
[5153.78 --> 5155.04]  that that
[5155.04 --> 5155.80]  word daily
[5155.80 --> 5157.44]  matters.
[5159.48 --> 5160.04]  Daily
[5160.04 --> 5160.80]  win the
[5160.80 --> 5161.34]  respect.
[5162.20 --> 5162.56]  Not just
[5162.56 --> 5162.94]  every once
[5162.94 --> 5163.28]  in a while.
[5163.86 --> 5164.28]  Not just
[5164.28 --> 5164.58]  when you're
[5164.58 --> 5165.12]  feeling like
[5165.12 --> 5165.50]  your best
[5165.50 --> 5165.90]  self.
[5166.30 --> 5166.60]  Not when
[5166.60 --> 5166.96]  you've got
[5166.96 --> 5168.16]  your patience
[5168.16 --> 5168.74]  all figured
[5168.74 --> 5169.18]  out and
[5169.18 --> 5169.62]  your children
[5169.62 --> 5170.18]  all nice
[5170.18 --> 5170.74]  dressed and
[5170.74 --> 5171.24]  pressed and
[5171.24 --> 5171.54]  in their
[5171.54 --> 5172.16]  ties ready
[5172.16 --> 5172.56]  to go.
[5173.12 --> 5173.68]  Daily
[5173.68 --> 5175.80]  this is
[5175.80 --> 5176.74]  our
[5176.74 --> 5177.74]  call.
[5178.74 --> 5181.20]  And lastly
[5181.20 --> 5181.60]  I think
[5181.60 --> 5181.94]  this is
[5181.94 --> 5182.30]  bigger than
[5182.30 --> 5182.58]  we have
[5182.58 --> 5183.06]  time for
[5183.06 --> 5183.58]  this morning
[5183.58 --> 5185.44]  but I
[5185.44 --> 5185.86]  wonder
[5185.86 --> 5188.22]  is
[5188.22 --> 5189.18]  your
[5189.18 --> 5189.92]  ambition
[5189.92 --> 5190.86]  as a
[5190.86 --> 5191.22]  Christian
[5191.22 --> 5191.80]  missionary
[5191.80 --> 5193.32]  to lead
[5193.32 --> 5193.80]  a quiet
[5193.80 --> 5194.30]  life?
[5196.58 --> 5197.30]  Or
[5197.30 --> 5197.76]  do you
[5197.76 --> 5198.20]  think
[5198.20 --> 5198.78]  you have
[5198.78 --> 5198.90]  the
[5198.90 --> 5199.38]  responsibility
[5199.38 --> 5200.08]  to be
[5200.08 --> 5200.68]  the loudest
[5200.68 --> 5201.02]  voice
[5201.02 --> 5201.32]  because
[5201.32 --> 5201.54]  you're
[5201.54 --> 5201.66]  the
[5201.66 --> 5202.06]  rightest
[5202.06 --> 5202.42]  voice?
[5203.92 --> 5204.80]  Do you
[5204.80 --> 5205.22]  think
[5205.22 --> 5205.42]  that
[5205.42 --> 5206.20]  you have
[5206.20 --> 5206.34]  a
[5206.34 --> 5206.76]  responsibility
[5206.76 --> 5207.28]  to
[5207.28 --> 5207.98]  change
[5207.98 --> 5208.20]  the
[5208.20 --> 5208.58]  entire
[5208.58 --> 5209.26]  system
[5209.26 --> 5210.00]  and to
[5210.00 --> 5210.46]  do so
[5210.46 --> 5211.00]  by any
[5211.00 --> 5211.24]  means
