[2657.78 → 2659.58] And then we'll give you the gift of music.
[2660.80 → 2662.68] I'm going to invite Jesus to come forward.
[2662.80 → 2666.84] He's an elder in our church, and there's a gift here to mark this occasion
[2666.84 → 2668.78] and to celebrate this day.
[2672.30 → 2673.18] Lord bless you.
[2673.18 → 2675.36] Let's stand and sing together.
[2676.42 → 2706.40] Let's stand and sing together.
[2706.40 → 2714.40] Oh my soul, worship His holy name.
[2715.40 → 2718.40] Sing like never before.
[2719.92 → 2726.40] Oh my soul, I worship Your holy name.
[2726.40 → 2734.40] The sun comes up.
[2734.40 → 2738.40] It's a new day dawning.
[2738.40 → 2744.40] It's time to sing Your song again.
[2744.40 → 2752.40] Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me.
[2752.40 → 2758.40] Let me be singing when the evening comes.
[2758.40 → 2759.40] Let's stand and sing together.
[2759.40 → 2760.40] Let's stand and sing together.
[2760.40 → 2764.40] Let's stand and sing together.
[2764.40 → 2768.40] Lord, oh my soul, oh my soul, oh my soul.
[2768.40 → 2773.40] Oh my soul, worship His holy name.
[2773.40 → 2774.40] Sing like never before.
[2774.40 → 2775.40] Oh my soul, oh my soul.
[2775.40 → 2777.40] Oh my soul, I worship Your holy name.
[2777.40 → 2778.40] Oh my soul, oh my soul.
[2778.40 → 2779.40] Oh my soul, oh my soul.
[2779.40 → 2780.40] Oh my soul, oh my soul.
[2780.40 → 2784.40] Oh my soul, I worship Your holy name.
[2784.40 → 2790.40] Oh my soul, oh my soul, oh my soul.
[2790.40 → 2796.40] Your rich in love and Your soul to anger.
[2796.40 → 2802.40] Your need is great, and your heart is bright
[2803.40 → 2809.40] For all your goodness I will keep on singing
[2810.40 → 2817.40] Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find
[2817.40 → 2827.40] Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul
[2828.40 → 2832.40] Worship His holy name
[2833.40 → 2839.40] Sing like ever before, O my soul
[2840.40 → 2845.40] I'll worship Your holy name
[2847.40 → 2855.40] And on that day when my strength is failing
[2856.40 → 2861.40] The end draws near and my time has come
[2862.40 → 2868.40] Still my soul will sing Your praise unending
[2868.40 → 2877.40] Ten thousand years and then forevermore
[2878.40 → 2885.40] Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul
[2885.40 → 2890.40] Worship His holy name
[2891.40 → 2897.40] Sing like ever before, O my soul
[2897.40 → 2900.40] I'll worship Your holy name
[2900.40 → 2907.40] Sing like ever before, O my soul
[2907.40 → 2910.40] Sing like ever before, O my soul
[2910.40 → 2916.40] I'll worship Your holy name
[2916.40 → 2922.40] Sing like ever before, O my soul
[2922.40 → 2925.40] I'll worship Your holy name
[2925.40 → 2928.40] I'll worship Your holy name
[2928.40 → 2933.40] I'll worship Your holy name
[2933.40 → 2942.40] Lord, I'll worship Your holy name
[2942.40 → 2943.40] I'll worship your holy name
[2944.40 → 2945.40] My name is Pete, and I'm a deacon here at Emmanuel
[2945.40 → 2954.40] and first I'd like to
[2954.40 → 2966.00] I was afraid I'd have to try to turn this thing on, but thanks.
[2966.72 → 2967.54] My name is Pete.
[2967.66 → 2968.94] I'm a deacon here at Emanuel.
[2969.62 → 2977.14] And first, I'd like to let you know that next week's offering is going to be a reverse offering.
[2977.14 → 2982.86] So that will be, there'll be gift certificates in the bags or in the I don't know if it's
[2982.86 → 2985.80] going to be a bag or a basket, but you'll see gift certificates.
[2986.68 → 2996.66] So as the Lord puts people on your hearts this week that may need some help, we just have
[2996.66 → 3001.30] them in mind as the baskets go by and take out the ones that you would like to give.
[3001.30 → 3006.86] So this week's offering is for Wagner Hills.
[3006.86 → 3013.78] And they're a ministry based in Langley itself.
[3013.78 → 3023.02] They minister to men and women that have problems with addictions, and they offer classes.
[3023.02 → 3025.10] They offer counselling.
[3025.68 → 3027.26] It's a year-long program.
[3027.26 → 3035.62] They also have groups that go out and work in the community and just so that they can
[3035.62 → 3037.42] get back into regular life.
[3037.42 → 3041.04] I think it's a real worthwhile cause to support.
[3041.22 → 3044.80] It's a Christian-based service with them.
[3045.36 → 3051.42] Also, if you're interested in giving to the budget of the church, it'd be best to ear tag
[3051.42 → 3055.30] it or to use the envelopes in the rows.
[3056.06 → 3059.36] Or you can do it by, there are three different ways there.
[3059.56 → 3064.30] You can do it on email or one of those kind of things.
[3064.42 → 3065.84] I'm terrible at technology.
[3066.04 → 3068.68] So it's like, I'm sure you can read those.
[3069.46 → 3069.74] All right.
[3069.90 → 3073.12] So just give as the Lord has blessed.
[3073.50 → 3073.88] Thanks.
[3073.88 → 3092.74] All right.
[3092.74 → 3096.66] Bethlehem appeared to start
[3096.66 → 3102.34] All angels sang to lowly shepherds
[3102.34 → 3107.04] Three wise men seeking truth
[3107.04 → 3110.18] Travelled from above
[3110.18 → 3115.30] Hoping to find a child from heaven
[3115.30 → 3119.20] Falling away
[3119.20 → 3126.88] Thou before the humble Prince of Kings
[3126.88 → 3133.58] We bring an offering of worship to our King
[3133.58 → 3140.06] No one on earth deserves the praises that we sing
[3140.06 → 3146.54] Jesus, may you receive the honour that you're due
[3146.54 → 3153.22] Oh Lord, we bring an offering to you
[3153.22 → 3160.22] We bring an offering to you
[3160.22 → 3172.10] The Son cannot prepare to the glory of your love
[3172.10 → 3177.90] There is no shadow in your presence
[3177.90 → 3185.58] No mortal man would dare to stand before your throne
[3185.58 → 3190.58] Before the Holy One of Heaven
[3190.58 → 3195.58] It's only by your love
[3195.58 → 3198.58] It's only through your mercy
[3198.58 → 3207.26] O Lord, I bring an offering to you
[3207.26 → 3215.94] I bring an offering to you
[3215.94 → 3221.62] Jesus, may you receive the honour that you're due
[3221.62 → 3228.30] O Lord, I bring an offering to you
[3228.30 → 3232.30] I bring an offering to you
[3232.30 → 3234.30] I bring an offering to you
[3234.30 → 3246.98] O Lord, I bring an offering to you
[3246.98 → 3259.66] O Lord, I bring an offering to you
[3259.66 → 3263.66] O Lord, I bring an offering to you
[3263.66 → 3281.34] O Lord, I encourage you
[3281.34 → 3286.34] O Lord, I bring an offering to you
[3286.34 → 3295.82] Good morning, everybody. Can I have the preschool all the way up to grade four come on up to
[3295.82 → 3312.46] the front today? Can anybody in this group, some of you are new, so you might not have
[3312.46 → 3317.12] been here last week. Can anybody in this group remember two main characters that we
[3317.12 → 3329.18] talked about last week? No? Yeah? Yeah, we talked about Elizabeth and Zachariah and
[3329.18 → 3335.06] they heard some news. Yeah? And this week, you're right, Mateo, this week we're going
[3335.06 → 3340.30] to talk about Mary and Joseph and how they got some unexpected news from a
[3340.30 → 3345.96] messenger and how they had to change their plans and how they felt about it.
[3345.96 → 3356.40] So I have, I've been going over a new devotional in, at home, and it goes through
[3356.40 → 3360.88] songs. So we're going to say, we're going to do a little prayer. So can everybody close
[3360.88 → 3367.82] their eyes, fold their hands? God of order, in all my disorder, in the middle of my
[3367.82 → 3374.90] uncertainty, you are certain. You are sure, you are faithful, you are good. Even as Mary
[3374.90 → 3380.26] and Joseph were experiencing moments both holy and traumatic, not too far away were
[3380.26 → 3384.82] shepherds tending their flocks. Shepherds whom you would lead to come see the newborn
[3384.82 → 3389.98] Saviour. You're already working in the midst of this couple's upheaval, moving in their
[3389.98 → 3396.28] mayhem, tender in their turmoil, divine in their disorder. You are the God of great and
[3396.28 → 3401.58] perfect plans. Even in the messiness of life this season, you might well be leading me
[3401.58 → 3407.38] to be to the miraculous, and I will trust you. Amen.
[3408.44 → 3412.58] So in church's worship time, we're going to learn a little bit more on how we can trust
[3412.58 → 3419.36] in God when our plans are not the way that we think they should be. So lets everybody
[3419.36 → 3429.36] stand up. Let's look at the congregation. And we're going to go one, two, three. The Lord
[3429.36 → 3432.14] is in the womb and also with you.
[3449.36 → 3466.58] Hi, my name is Paul, and I'm an elder here at this church. Before we go to prayer, it's
[3466.58 → 3473.36] my privilege to lead us in prayer this morning. We have a couple of updates and council announcements.
[3473.36 → 3482.36] And we want to thank everybody who made the craft fair and bake sale yesterday a huge success.
[3482.36 → 3488.60] Thanks for all that came out and those that participated. A special thank you to the leaders
[3488.60 → 3496.36] and those who helped and set up and clean up. And it was great to have that happen here yesterday.
[3496.36 → 3506.36] As the end of the year approaches, we'd like to thank everybody for your faithful support
[3506.36 → 3513.36] and giving throughout the year. At the end of November, we find ourselves only 11% behind.
[3513.36 → 3520.36] So we're, praise God for that. By the end of the year, we're required to make our budget.
[3520.36 → 3531.36] So we ask that you will consider helping us finish strong. I want to also remind you that next Sunday
[3531.36 → 3540.36] is Lord's Supper. We encourage you to spend this week preparing your hearts and to be met by Christ
[3540.36 → 3553.36] at the table next week. If you have kids, we encourage that you will talk to them about what this means as we gather.
[3553.36 → 3560.36] And one thing that hasn't been in the bulletin that I want to bring before you is, as many of you may know,
[3560.36 → 3570.36] Leo and Debbie Benny, their son, Lane, the youngest, is very sick. He has stomach cancer.
[3570.36 → 3582.36] And we want to bring him before the Lord. As well, we want to, what has been in the bulletin is the passing away
[3582.36 → 3593.36] of Corrine Muller's father, Cor Bolt. We want you to know that this funeral will be held next week, or this week,
[3593.36 → 3606.36] sorry, Friday, at Maple Ridge Christian Forum Church. The time will be probably in the midweek bulletin.
[3606.36 → 3619.36] Let's go to our God in prayer.
[3619.36 → 3627.36] Father in heaven, once again we come before you with a sense of awe.
[3627.36 → 3634.36] Especially in this season of Advent, we can only start to grasp how great you are.
[3636.36 → 3643.36] From the tiniest neuron to the vastness of space, you created it all.
[3643.36 → 3650.36] All you had to do was to speak it, and it was there. And still, you chose to make us part of it all,
[3650.36 → 3654.36] and call us your children.
[3654.36 → 3661.36] In this season, we remember and celebrate how you came to be with us.
[3661.36 → 3669.36] And we sing, you stepped down from heaven, humbly you came, God of all creation, here with us,
[3669.36 → 3676.36] in a starlit manger, Emmanuel, God with us.
[3676.36 → 3679.36] How unexpected.
[3679.36 → 3681.36] Then and now.
[3681.36 → 3684.36] Help us to see you for who you are.
[3684.36 → 3691.36] Help us to be part of your plan as a church community, as well as each one of us, personally.
[3691.36 → 3697.36] Thank you, Father, for all you do for us here as a church community.
[3697.36 → 3701.36] Thank you for all the ministries that do your work here.
[3701.36 → 3706.36] Thank you for bringing us all here together again this morning.
[3706.36 → 3712.36] We pray you will accept our worship here and in our daily lives.
[3712.36 → 3713.36] We pray for you, God.
[3713.36 → 3714.36] We pray for you, God.
[3714.36 → 3719.36] Because we know who you are, we can also come to you with our petitions.
[3719.36 → 3726.36] We pray for the Muller and Bolt families as they grieve the loss of Cor Bolt,
[3726.36 → 3732.36] Father to Corrine and Grandfather to Brianna, Matthew and Anthony,
[3732.36 → 3736.36] who passed away this past Wednesday morning.
[3736.36 → 3743.36] May God grant them peace, comfort and strength as they walk through this time.
[3743.36 → 3747.36] We thank you for the gift of baptism of Ruth.
[3747.36 → 3755.36] We ask for your blessing over her life, that she may grow in faith and joy and wisdom.
[3755.36 → 3762.36] We pray for Haley and Nate as they guide and nurture her in God's love.
[3762.36 → 3768.36] May this special day mark the beginning of a lifetime walking with you.
[3768.36 → 3775.36] We give thanks to God and celebrate the arrival of the baby boy, John Peter,
[3775.36 → 3780.36] born to Josh and Rachel and the big sister, Elizabeth.
[3780.36 → 3787.36] We pray God will give them a...
[3787.36 → 3796.36] We thank you for safe delivery, and we pray that you will continue to give health and strength from mom and baby.
[3796.36 → 3799.36] We pray that you will continue to bless them.
[3799.36 → 3806.36] Lord, we pray for Lane Benny.
[3806.36 → 3808.36] Lord, we ask for healing.
[3808.36 → 3815.36] We ask that you will give strength and peace as he deals with this illness.
[3815.36 → 3829.36] As we enter this winter season, we lift all who are homebound and unable to get out.
[3829.36 → 3835.36] We pray for comfort and companionship and strength for all who are at home.
[3835.36 → 3840.36] Lord, we pray that you will hold them close.
[3840.36 → 3844.36] We pray for those who struggle with mental health at this time of the year.
[3844.36 → 3847.36] We ask that you will give them your peace and light.
[3847.36 → 3854.36] Lord, we pray for the persecuted church all around the world.
[3854.36 → 3859.36] Those who stand and praise your name, Lord.
[3859.36 → 3865.36] Lord, we ask that you will give them the strength that they need.
[3865.36 → 3870.36] Lord, we ask that you will continue to help this church to gather in your name,
[3870.36 → 3875.36] to grow in the knowledge that you are with us and saved us from our sins.
[3875.36 → 3881.36] Help us to go out into the community around us and be a light.
[3881.36 → 3884.36] Father, we pray here us.
[3884.36 → 3890.36] Look at the list of our concerns.
[3890.36 → 3894.36] We know that you knew it before we wrote it down.
[3895.16 → 3897.16] We know that you know better than us
[3897.16 → 3899.70] what must be prayed in each of these circumstances.
[3900.68 → 3903.74] We ask that your Holy Spirit completes it.
[3906.12 → 3908.34] As we hear your word for us this morning,
[3908.48 → 3909.64] preached by Pastor Chris,
[3909.64 → 3914.30] fill us with your will and purpose.
[3916.76 → 3918.54] Guide us by your Holy Spirit
[3918.54 → 3921.24] so that your kingdom will advance through us
[3921.24 → 3923.50] and your holy name is glorified
[3923.50 → 3926.76] the story of amazing love,
[3927.88 → 3929.96] the light of the world given for us.
[3931.08 → 3934.50] We pray that our eyes will be fixed on Jesus.
[3935.22 → 3936.72] We pray that by your Spirit,
[3936.72 → 3939.04] you will bring it in our hearts to believe
[3939.04 → 3940.26] and to trust in you.
[3941.18 → 3944.56] We ask all these things because of your holy name.
[3945.38 → 3945.66] Amen.
[3953.50 → 3966.60] This Advent and Christmas,
[3966.60 → 3973.70] we are here at Emanuel going through a preaching series
[3973.70 → 3976.22] and we've called The Cast of Christmas,
[3976.22 → 3979.64] looking at different characters in this story.
[3979.64 → 3983.32] And today, we're going to be looking more closely
[3983.32 → 3987.40] at Mary and Joseph and who they are
[3987.40 → 3989.50] and their story for us.
[3989.58 → 3992.16] And so we're going to do that by reading from two places.
[3992.16 → 3996.46] We're going to read from Luke 1, verse 26 to 38.
[3996.70 → 4001.18] And then we will read from Matthew 1, 18 to 25.
[4001.68 → 4005.68] We'll start with Luke 1, 26 to 38.
[4006.02 → 4006.36] Luke 1, 26 to 38.
[4006.36 → 4009.62] Luke 1, 26 to 38.
[4009.64 → 4014.76] In the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy,
[4015.34 → 4018.06] God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth,
[4018.20 → 4019.30] a town in Galilee,
[4019.84 → 4023.24] to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph,
[4023.50 → 4024.62] a descendant of David.
[4025.34 → 4027.48] The virgin's name was Mary.
[4028.16 → 4029.96] The angel went to her and said,
[4030.30 → 4032.94] greetings, you who are highly favoured.
[4033.36 → 4034.64] The Lord is with you.
[4035.94 → 4038.18] Mary was greatly troubled at his words
[4038.18 → 4041.26] and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.
[4042.10 → 4043.72] But the angel said to her,
[4043.72 → 4045.56] do not be afraid, Mary.
[4046.14 → 4047.86] You have found favour with God.
[4048.52 → 4050.98] You will conceive and give birth to a son
[4050.98 → 4053.26] and you are to call him Jesus.
[4054.20 → 4057.56] He will be great and will be called the son of the most high.
[4058.04 → 4061.12] The Lord God will give him the throne of his father, David,
[4061.12 → 4064.52] and he will reign over Jacob's descendants forever.
[4065.00 → 4066.92] His kingdom will never end.
[4066.92 → 4069.46] How can this be?
[4069.46 → 4072.64] Mary asked the angel, since I am a virgin.
[4073.80 → 4075.22] The angel answered,
[4076.26 → 4078.30] the Holy Spirit will come on you
[4078.30 → 4081.36] and the power of the most high will overshadow you.
[4081.76 → 4085.76] So the holy one to be born will be called the son of God.
[4086.54 → 4088.30] Even Elizabeth, your relative,
[4088.30 → 4090.62] is going to have a child in her old age
[4090.62 → 4093.48] and she who was said to be unable to conceive
[4093.48 → 4095.14] is in her sixth month.
[4095.14 → 4099.76] For no word from God will ever fail.
[4101.24 → 4103.78] I am the Lord's servant, Mary answered.
[4104.44 → 4106.56] May your word to me be fulfilled.
[4107.40 → 4108.66] Then the angel left her.
[4111.12 → 4116.44] Now we will read from the beginning of Matthew's gospel account,
[4116.60 → 4119.52] Matthew chapter 1, starting at verse 18.
[4125.14 → 4129.56] This is how the birth of Jesus, the Messiah, came about.
[4130.04 → 4133.90] His mother, Mary, was pledged to be married to Joseph,
[4134.40 → 4136.30] but before they came together,
[4136.54 → 4139.04] she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit.
[4139.92 → 4143.06] Because Joseph, her husband, was faithful to the law
[4143.06 → 4146.82] and yet did not want to expose her to public disgrace,
[4146.82 → 4150.00] he had in mind to divorce her quietly.
[4151.84 → 4153.82] But after he had considered this,
[4153.88 → 4156.18] an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream
[4156.18 → 4156.66] and said,
[4156.82 → 4158.44] Joseph, son of David,
[4159.00 → 4162.48] do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife
[4162.48 → 4166.40] because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
[4167.28 → 4168.96] She will give birth to a son
[4168.96 → 4171.22] and you are to give him the name Jesus
[4171.22 → 4174.62] because he will save his people from their sins.
[4176.32 → 4178.32] All this took place to fulfill
[4178.32 → 4180.20] what the Lord had said through the prophet.
[4180.94 → 4183.62] The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son
[4183.62 → 4185.34] and they will call him Emmanuel,
[4185.86 → 4187.34] which means God with us.
[4189.30 → 4191.04] When Joseph woke up,
[4191.14 → 4193.76] he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him
[4193.76 → 4195.62] and took Mary home as his wife.
[4196.48 → 4198.38] But he did not consummate their marriage
[4198.38 → 4200.18] until she gave birth to a son
[4200.18 → 4203.30] and he gave him the name Jesus.
[4203.98 → 4205.18] This is the word of the Lord.
[4211.90 → 4214.80] When I was a kid at Christmastime
[4214.80 → 4216.84] and actually probably in October,
[4217.50 → 4220.88] the Toys R Us catalogue would come out.
[4222.00 → 4223.64] If you're older than I am,
[4223.74 → 4226.38] maybe it's the Sears catalogue that you remember.
[4226.38 → 4230.88] And my brothers and I would get this Toys R Us catalogue
[4230.88 → 4232.04] and we would sit there
[4232.04 → 4233.86] and we would just flip through it
[4233.86 → 4235.48] with a pen or a pencil
[4235.48 → 4238.24] and then just circle everything that we wanted.
[4238.46 → 4239.64] I want this circle.
[4239.78 → 4240.82] I want that circle.
[4241.14 → 4242.66] Oh, I better get this.
[4242.76 → 4243.60] Three circles.
[4244.90 → 4247.44] And then as we were doing that
[4247.44 → 4249.18] and the TV would be on,
[4249.30 → 4251.88] we would also hear a commercial on TV
[4251.88 → 4252.50] and we'd go,
[4252.58 → 4253.94] Mom, buy me that for Christmas.
[4255.76 → 4256.14] Right?
[4256.26 → 4260.26] And with this TV commercial
[4260.26 → 4263.58] would come the news
[4263.58 → 4267.80] that this is the best Nerf gun ever made.
[4267.94 → 4270.96] Shoot farther than you've ever been able to shoot before.
[4271.18 → 4271.94] And I would say,
[4272.02 → 4272.76] I want that
[4272.76 → 4275.08] because I want to shoot you from across the street.
[4275.08 → 4282.78] Now, we see this perhaps most particularly at Christmas,
[4282.88 → 4284.20] but this is true year round, right?
[4284.46 → 4287.58] Here is how advertising works.
[4289.16 → 4290.40] Because these companies,
[4290.84 → 4291.82] in those commercials
[4291.82 → 4293.46] and in those magazines,
[4293.58 → 4295.78] aren't really selling you a product.
[4296.04 → 4296.76] Now, to be clear,
[4297.14 → 4299.16] they want you to buy their product,
[4299.16 → 4301.70] but they do it by selling you a story.
[4303.34 → 4303.74] Right?
[4303.80 → 4305.16] The product is a symbol.
[4305.98 → 4308.48] It's a foil for a way of life,
[4308.98 → 4310.74] for an experience of joy
[4310.74 → 4312.20] that would be unmatched
[4312.20 → 4313.42] and unparalleled
[4313.42 → 4314.98] but for this thing.
[4316.28 → 4318.22] It's never said outright,
[4319.00 → 4322.28] but car marketing is never really about the car,
[4322.44 → 4324.28] even when they list all the features
[4324.28 → 4325.98] and the fuel mileage that you can get.
[4326.16 → 4328.16] The real pitch is the story.
[4328.16 → 4330.56] The real pitch is the open road.
[4331.50 → 4332.02] Right?
[4332.10 → 4334.38] The beautiful driving up to Whistler
[4334.38 → 4336.38] with no other cars on the streets.
[4336.52 → 4337.22] Have you ever seen that?
[4338.28 → 4339.42] But there it is.
[4339.54 → 4340.68] That's what they're selling you.
[4341.48 → 4341.74] Right?
[4341.84 → 4345.18] The pitch is the beautiful night sky
[4345.18 → 4347.54] with stars that you can't normally see,
[4347.64 → 4349.22] but somehow you can see them
[4349.22 → 4351.70] through the moon roof of this car
[4351.70 → 4353.10] and the partner beside you
[4353.10 → 4354.74] is much more beautiful than you deserve.
[4355.66 → 4356.08] Right?
[4356.12 → 4357.38] They're selling you a story.
[4358.16 → 4359.84] Not just a vehicle.
[4360.28 → 4362.00] They're selling you a vision for life.
[4362.42 → 4363.50] The car or the thing
[4363.50 → 4364.92] just becomes a symbol for that.
[4366.78 → 4368.02] And here's the thing.
[4369.58 → 4372.00] Because the same has become true
[4372.00 → 4373.04] at Christmas.
[4374.94 → 4375.42] Right?
[4375.54 → 4376.72] Each week at Christmas
[4376.72 → 4377.86] in the season of Advent,
[4378.10 → 4380.78] we move through hope, joy, love,
[4380.78 → 4382.58] and today, peace.
[4383.16 → 4386.42] And we're being sold an idea
[4386.42 → 4389.90] of what peace is by the world.
[4390.64 → 4390.74] Right?
[4390.74 → 4393.64] The world around us wants to sell peace,
[4393.64 → 4399.28] but only if you buy a certain way of life with it.
[4400.28 → 4400.70] Right?
[4400.74 → 4402.26] The world around us whispers
[4402.26 → 4404.38] and maybe sometimes shouts,
[4404.38 → 4407.90] you can have peace if you just change this.
[4409.04 → 4411.46] If you just chase the right thing.
[4411.54 → 4414.76] And so we end up chasing these ethereal ideas
[4414.76 → 4416.76] that end in a story,
[4416.90 → 4418.96] in a picture of the good life.
[4419.34 → 4420.44] To put it another way,
[4421.16 → 4425.24] our culture has packaged peace as a product
[4425.24 → 4428.50] and put it in a catalogue that we can choose from
[4428.50 → 4430.90] as we circle our particular ideas of it.
[4430.90 → 4432.72] So for example,
[4432.80 → 4433.68] let me illustrate this.
[4434.02 → 4435.08] Maybe you've heard this,
[4435.16 → 4435.98] maybe you've believed it,
[4436.04 → 4437.04] maybe you are sitting here
[4437.04 → 4438.52] hoping that it's true.
[4440.44 → 4442.00] But peace will come
[4442.00 → 4444.62] when you just get a little bit of an escape.
[4445.94 → 4446.34] Right?
[4446.40 → 4447.98] This is the idea of peace that comes
[4447.98 → 4449.64] as we get away from it all.
[4450.30 → 4450.58] Right?
[4450.62 → 4451.66] The promise goes like this.
[4451.78 → 4453.60] If we can just step away
[4453.60 → 4455.82] from the chaos of lifelong enough,
[4456.34 → 4457.90] I'll come back renewed.
[4459.54 → 4459.94] Right?
[4459.94 → 4461.24] Seven days in Mexico,
[4461.44 → 4462.58] not quite going to do it.
[4462.78 → 4463.18] Nine,
[4463.36 → 4464.30] that's my target.
[4465.56 → 4465.90] Right?
[4465.96 → 4466.80] And in that picture,
[4466.96 → 4468.78] peace is somewhere out there.
[4468.90 → 4470.64] It's on the other side of a plane ticket,
[4470.92 → 4471.74] a weekend alone.
[4471.92 → 4473.80] It's on the other side of a strategic
[4473.80 → 4475.22] shutting out other people
[4475.22 → 4476.34] and the demands of life.
[4476.54 → 4478.08] The sales pitch that we're hearing
[4478.08 → 4478.96] goes like this.
[4479.04 → 4480.30] Get far away enough
[4480.30 → 4481.94] from your ordinary responsibilities
[4481.94 → 4483.50] and peace will catch up to you.
[4484.72 → 4485.74] Peace will come
[4485.74 → 4487.14] when you silence the noise
[4487.14 → 4488.98] by removing yourself from it.
[4488.98 → 4490.24] Treat yourself
[4490.24 → 4492.28] is the modern liturgy
[4492.28 → 4493.50] of self-salvation,
[4494.42 → 4495.56] of finding your own peace.
[4496.24 → 4497.46] Or another way that peace
[4497.46 → 4499.14] is marketed to us
[4499.14 → 4500.94] is we hear things like,
[4501.28 → 4502.32] what I really need to do
[4502.32 → 4504.24] is just find myself
[4504.24 → 4505.42] within myself.
[4506.16 → 4507.34] This is the peace
[4507.34 → 4509.86] of becoming fully yourself.
[4510.28 → 4511.88] And please,
[4511.96 → 4512.70] I want to be really clear.
[4512.90 → 4513.02] Right?
[4513.08 → 4514.94] Don't hear what I'm not saying.
[4514.94 → 4515.94] I do, like,
[4516.20 → 4517.40] we want everyone
[4517.40 → 4519.38] to genuinely feel like
[4519.38 → 4520.88] they don't need to put on a mask,
[4520.92 → 4522.08] like you don't need to pretend
[4522.08 → 4523.78] to be who you are,
[4523.86 → 4525.70] to conform to certain standards
[4525.70 → 4526.86] or social conventions.
[4528.30 → 4529.98] But we also want to be wise.
[4530.94 → 4531.16] Right?
[4531.20 → 4531.96] Because the promise here
[4531.96 → 4532.68] goes like this.
[4533.24 → 4535.64] If you can just discover yourself,
[4535.90 → 4536.92] express yourself,
[4537.06 → 4538.20] be your true self,
[4538.36 → 4540.04] then you will finally
[4540.04 → 4541.68] be settled within.
[4543.68 → 4545.88] The cultural script says,
[4546.16 → 4546.68] look inward,
[4546.92 → 4548.70] identify your truest you,
[4549.06 → 4550.80] throw off external expectations
[4550.80 → 4551.72] and constraint
[4551.72 → 4552.98] that are constraining
[4552.98 → 4554.34] your authentic expression.
[4554.74 → 4556.16] Live out your inner truth
[4556.16 → 4557.02] without apology
[4557.02 → 4558.58] and then peace will bloom.
[4560.06 → 4560.48] But again,
[4560.54 → 4561.64] here's where we have to be wise.
[4561.92 → 4562.10] Right?
[4562.18 → 4564.06] Because a peace like that
[4564.06 → 4564.98] is fragile.
[4565.98 → 4567.40] And it's always moving
[4567.40 → 4568.18] and shifting.
[4568.18 → 4570.30] And it depends entirely
[4570.30 → 4572.04] on maintaining a sense of self
[4572.04 → 4573.64] that is constantly changing.
[4574.36 → 4575.68] It requires affirmation
[4575.68 → 4576.16] from others
[4576.16 → 4577.08] in order to survive
[4577.08 → 4578.50] even as it claims
[4578.50 → 4580.04] to be independent of others.
[4582.12 → 4583.20] And lastly,
[4583.44 → 4584.70] and one of the other,
[4584.98 → 4586.54] perhaps most common ways
[4586.54 → 4589.38] that we are sold ideas of peace
[4589.38 → 4593.02] is we say things like,
[4593.64 → 4595.90] I just need to slow down.
[4595.90 → 4598.62] This is the promise
[4598.62 → 4600.48] that peace will come
[4600.48 → 4604.06] when life finally slows down.
[4604.14 → 4604.88] The promise here
[4604.88 → 4605.52] is the idea
[4605.52 → 4608.10] that if life would become easier,
[4608.66 → 4610.58] then I'll be able to breathe.
[4611.74 → 4613.70] And so peace becomes imagined
[4613.70 → 4615.08] as the reward
[4615.08 → 4619.06] for a perfectly organized calendar,
[4619.86 → 4622.08] a beautifully balanced workload
[4622.08 → 4623.60] and good health
[4623.60 → 4625.16] and proper gym schedules,
[4625.56 → 4627.04] cooperative children,
[4628.00 → 4629.16] stable finances,
[4630.30 → 4630.84] retirement.
[4632.48 → 4632.68] Right?
[4632.70 → 4633.60] The vision offered
[4633.60 → 4634.00] is that
[4634.00 → 4636.46] when things finally calm down,
[4636.58 → 4638.18] then I will have peace.
[4638.68 → 4640.46] When the chaos finally lifts,
[4640.74 → 4642.28] then your soul can rest.
[4642.36 → 4643.54] When your schedule slows
[4643.54 → 4644.92] or the seasons change,
[4645.04 → 4646.66] then you can finally feel
[4646.66 → 4647.92] like yourself again.
[4647.92 → 4650.32] But this kind of peace
[4650.32 → 4652.12] is always peace deferred.
[4652.94 → 4653.40] Right?
[4653.46 → 4654.28] Because even when
[4654.28 → 4655.10] the current thing
[4655.10 → 4655.88] that is upsetting
[4655.88 → 4657.54] your peace concludes,
[4657.64 → 4658.26] something else
[4658.26 → 4659.04] is going to come along.
[4660.14 → 4660.32] Right?
[4660.78 → 4661.88] Here's an illustration
[4661.88 → 4662.64] that's apropos
[4662.64 → 4663.24] for this moment.
[4663.60 → 4664.58] If you believe
[4664.58 → 4665.52] that peace will come
[4665.52 → 4666.24] when you finally
[4666.24 → 4667.60] are able to buy a house,
[4668.38 → 4669.02] within a year
[4669.02 → 4669.82] of buying a house,
[4669.88 → 4671.02] your furnace is going to break
[4671.02 → 4671.58] and you're going to need
[4671.58 → 4672.10] a new roof.
[4672.54 → 4673.44] Ask me how I know.
[4673.44 → 4677.68] So here's the question
[4677.68 → 4678.52] for us this Advent.
[4680.12 → 4681.46] What does it look like
[4681.46 → 4683.26] to have peace
[4683.26 → 4685.88] when the furnace breaks?
[4686.76 → 4687.92] Not after it's fixed.
[4689.62 → 4690.58] What does it look like
[4690.58 → 4691.42] to have peace
[4691.42 → 4692.62] that isn't dependent
[4692.62 → 4694.14] upon my feelings
[4694.14 → 4695.06] about myself
[4695.06 → 4695.96] or a peace
[4695.96 → 4696.82] that doesn't change
[4696.82 → 4697.66] with my moods
[4697.66 → 4698.82] or with the affirmation
[4698.82 → 4699.32] of others?
[4699.74 → 4700.68] What does it look like
[4700.68 → 4701.50] to have a peace
[4701.50 → 4702.90] that we can have
[4702.90 → 4703.94] and live in the midst
[4703.94 → 4705.10] of right now?
[4705.22 → 4705.88] In the midst
[4705.88 → 4707.08] of all the responsibilities
[4707.08 → 4707.82] of life?
[4707.88 → 4708.26] In the midst
[4708.26 → 4709.24] of all the noise
[4709.24 → 4710.58] that's going on around us?
[4710.62 → 4711.04] In the midst
[4711.04 → 4711.72] of the chaos
[4711.72 → 4712.90] that's even bouncing
[4712.90 → 4714.06] in my own brain?
[4714.58 → 4715.72] Is there a peace
[4715.72 → 4718.56] that can be present there?
[4721.38 → 4722.36] If the peace
[4722.36 → 4723.56] we long for
[4723.56 → 4725.44] keeps falling apart
[4725.44 → 4726.38] the moment
[4726.38 → 4728.10] our plans fall apart,
[4728.26 → 4729.60] then something is wrong
[4729.60 → 4730.72] with the kind of peace
[4730.72 → 4731.58] we are chasing.
[4732.90 → 4734.22] We don't need a peace
[4734.22 → 4734.92] that only works
[4734.92 → 4736.32] when life cooperates.
[4736.54 → 4737.46] We need a peace
[4737.46 → 4738.30] strong enough
[4738.30 → 4739.40] to hold
[4739.40 → 4741.14] when life doesn't cooperate.
[4741.78 → 4742.62] If peace
[4742.62 → 4743.58] can only exist
[4743.58 → 4744.82] when life slows down
[4744.82 → 4746.16] or after we find ourselves
[4746.16 → 4747.04] or after we escape
[4747.04 → 4747.54] the pressure,
[4747.74 → 4748.40] then peace
[4748.40 → 4749.90] is always out of reach.
[4751.04 → 4752.08] But scripture
[4752.08 → 4753.50] keeps pointing us
[4753.50 → 4755.68] to a different reality.
[4756.88 → 4756.96] Right?
[4757.04 → 4757.66] God keeps
[4757.66 → 4759.32] bringing peace
[4759.32 → 4759.90] to people
[4759.90 → 4761.06] not by protecting
[4761.06 → 4762.24] our plans
[4762.24 → 4763.56] but by interrupting
[4763.56 → 4763.98] them,
[4764.20 → 4765.40] by redirecting
[4765.40 → 4765.62] them,
[4765.64 → 4766.66] and by reshaping
[4766.66 → 4766.98] them.
[4768.50 → 4769.12] The theme
[4769.12 → 4769.74] that I want us
[4769.74 → 4770.54] to see this morning
[4770.54 → 4771.38] in the stories
[4771.38 → 4772.34] of Joseph and Mary
[4772.34 → 4773.44] as examples
[4773.44 → 4773.92] of this
[4773.92 → 4775.04] is that true
[4775.04 → 4776.06] peace comes
[4776.06 → 4777.54] when we yield
[4777.54 → 4778.18] ourselves
[4778.18 → 4779.34] to God's will,
[4780.04 → 4780.78] even
[4780.78 → 4782.26] when it disrupts
[4782.26 → 4782.78] our plans.
[4784.12 → 4784.74] True peace
[4784.74 → 4785.50] comes when we
[4785.50 → 4786.44] yield ourselves
[4786.44 → 4787.82] to God's will.
[4787.82 → 4789.34] This is the story
[4789.34 → 4789.88] of Mary
[4789.88 → 4790.98] and Joseph.
[4791.94 → 4792.68] Nothing really
[4792.68 → 4793.38] goes according
[4793.38 → 4794.20] to their plans
[4794.20 → 4796.10] yet everything
[4796.10 → 4797.24] unfolds
[4797.24 → 4797.78] according to
[4797.78 → 4798.62] God's will.
[4799.98 → 4800.72] Their peace
[4800.72 → 4801.56] is not
[4801.56 → 4802.12] the peace
[4802.12 → 4802.96] of control,
[4803.32 → 4804.28] it is the peace
[4804.28 → 4805.18] of trust.
[4806.14 → 4807.16] Of trust
[4807.16 → 4807.76] when there is
[4807.76 → 4808.70] no control.
[4809.64 → 4810.24] When we step
[4810.24 → 4811.00] into the world
[4811.00 → 4811.58] of Mary
[4811.58 → 4812.72] and Joseph
[4812.72 → 4813.52] we have to
[4813.52 → 4814.22] remember
[4814.22 → 4815.32] that their lives
[4815.32 → 4815.86] and their world
[4815.86 → 4816.56] look very different
[4816.56 → 4817.00] than ours.
[4817.00 → 4819.38] a betrothal
[4819.38 → 4820.20] in their day,
[4820.30 → 4821.04] a wedding engagement
[4821.04 → 4821.72] in their day
[4821.72 → 4822.58] does not look
[4822.58 → 4823.72] like a modern day
[4823.72 → 4824.34] engagement.
[4825.96 → 4827.08] The practice
[4827.08 → 4827.88] in their day
[4827.88 → 4828.44] begins
[4828.44 → 4829.72] with a formal
[4829.72 → 4830.32] arrangement
[4830.32 → 4831.28] between two
[4831.28 → 4831.96] families.
[4832.76 → 4833.82] One promising
[4833.82 → 4834.78] their son
[4834.78 → 4835.86] and the other
[4835.86 → 4836.72] their daughter
[4836.72 → 4837.54] in marriage.
[4838.88 → 4839.46] And once
[4839.46 → 4840.30] this agreement
[4840.30 → 4841.74] is made
[4841.74 → 4842.54] and sealed
[4842.54 → 4843.70] with a bride
[4843.70 → 4844.28] price
[4844.28 → 4845.90] it was considered
[4845.90 → 4846.46] binding.
[4847.00 → 4848.58] so binding
[4848.58 → 4849.34] actually
[4849.34 → 4850.10] that the only
[4850.10 → 4851.24] way to break
[4851.24 → 4852.18] the betrothal
[4852.18 → 4853.02] was through
[4853.02 → 4853.48] death
[4853.48 → 4854.94] or divorce.
[4856.26 → 4856.74] Right?
[4856.80 → 4857.52] The bride price
[4857.52 → 4858.12] would be paid
[4858.12 → 4858.84] by the groom's
[4858.84 → 4859.18] family
[4859.18 → 4860.00] and from that
[4860.00 → 4860.80] moment on
[4860.80 → 4861.84] the young woman
[4861.84 → 4862.64] is legally
[4862.64 → 4863.36] regarded
[4863.36 → 4865.00] as his wife
[4865.00 → 4865.80] even if they
[4865.80 → 4866.32] haven't yet
[4866.32 → 4867.14] consummated
[4867.14 → 4868.00] the marriage
[4868.00 → 4868.84] even actually
[4868.84 → 4869.46] if they haven't
[4869.46 → 4870.30] yet started
[4870.30 → 4871.18] living together.
[4871.18 → 4871.26] together.
[4872.26 → 4873.02] So the betrothal
[4873.02 → 4873.54] would happen
[4873.54 → 4874.44] and the couple
[4874.44 → 4875.34] would live apart
[4875.34 → 4876.84] for about a year
[4876.84 → 4878.60] before they would
[4878.60 → 4879.44] come together.
[4881.60 → 4882.44] They would live
[4882.44 → 4883.16] for about a year
[4883.16 → 4884.00] in their parents'
[4884.50 → 4884.76] houses
[4884.76 → 4885.54] and then they
[4885.54 → 4885.94] wouldn't
[4885.94 → 4886.92] consummate the
[4886.92 → 4887.16] marriage
[4887.16 → 4887.86] until after
[4887.86 → 4888.96] the ceremony.
[4889.08 → 4889.40] Now Luke
[4889.40 → 4890.22] doesn't tell us
[4890.22 → 4890.62] this
[4890.62 → 4892.34] doesn't tell us
[4892.34 → 4893.26] Mary's age
[4893.26 → 4894.68] but it wasn't
[4894.68 → 4895.14] uncommon
[4895.14 → 4895.90] for girls
[4895.90 → 4897.36] at that time
[4897.36 → 4898.32] to enter
[4898.32 → 4899.74] the betrothal
[4899.74 → 4900.18] period
[4900.18 → 4901.18] as young
[4901.18 → 4901.92] as 12
[4901.92 → 4902.60] or 13.
[4904.90 → 4905.36] Now this
[4905.36 → 4907.16] is the world
[4907.16 → 4907.86] that Mary
[4907.86 → 4909.14] is living in
[4909.14 → 4910.58] betrothed
[4910.58 → 4911.24] but not yet
[4911.24 → 4911.66] moved out
[4911.66 → 4912.22] of her parents'
[4912.36 → 4912.64] house
[4912.64 → 4913.80] when the angel
[4913.80 → 4914.68] appears to her.
[4915.50 → 4916.36] A young woman
[4916.36 → 4917.60] still in her parents'
[4918.08 → 4918.70] house
[4918.70 → 4919.78] still under their
[4919.78 → 4920.06] roof
[4920.06 → 4921.24] but in a legally
[4921.24 → 4922.38] binding marriage
[4922.38 → 4922.88] agreement
[4922.88 → 4924.04] with a ceremony
[4924.04 → 4924.72] yet to come.
[4925.50 → 4926.36] She has a path
[4926.36 → 4927.08] before her
[4927.08 → 4928.18] she has a plan
[4928.18 → 4928.92] and a timeline
[4928.92 → 4929.48] and there are
[4929.48 → 4930.10] expectations
[4930.10 → 4931.34] for herself
[4931.34 → 4931.92] and from her
[4931.92 → 4932.30] family
[4932.30 → 4933.30] from Joseph's
[4933.30 → 4933.62] family
[4933.62 → 4934.24] about how
[4934.24 → 4934.72] everything
[4934.72 → 4935.88] would unfold
[4935.88 → 4936.52] and then
[4936.52 → 4938.26] God interrupts.
[4940.16 → 4940.90] The angel
[4940.90 → 4941.60] comes and
[4941.60 → 4942.22] announces
[4942.22 → 4943.34] a calling
[4943.34 → 4943.90] that will
[4943.90 → 4944.48] turn her
[4944.48 → 4945.26] world upside
[4945.26 → 4945.70] down.
[4946.54 → 4947.30] Her reputation
[4947.30 → 4947.84] will be
[4947.84 → 4948.28] questioned
[4948.28 → 4949.08] Joseph
[4949.08 → 4949.66] will be
[4949.66 → 4950.24] confused
[4950.24 → 4951.06] her future
[4951.06 → 4951.66] will not
[4951.66 → 4952.24] unfold
[4952.24 → 4953.74] in any way
[4953.74 → 4954.22] near
[4954.22 → 4954.90] what the
[4954.90 → 4955.82] first century
[4955.82 → 4956.20] Jewish
[4956.20 → 4956.76] family
[4956.76 → 4957.20] would have
[4957.20 → 4957.80] mapped out
[4957.80 → 4958.26] for her
[4958.26 → 4958.88] in that
[4958.88 → 4959.22] time.
[4960.52 → 4961.20] And how
[4961.20 → 4961.56] does Mary
[4961.56 → 4962.14] respond?
[4964.40 → 4965.06] Luke tells
[4965.06 → 4965.44] us
[4965.44 → 4966.50] that she
[4966.50 → 4967.10] receives
[4967.10 → 4968.30] the angel's
[4968.30 → 4968.68] word
[4968.68 → 4969.68] with a
[4969.68 → 4970.34] wholehearted
[4970.34 → 4970.92] willingness
[4970.92 → 4971.76] to serve
[4971.76 → 4972.72] God.
[4973.72 → 4974.30] Right?
[4974.40 → 4975.26] She steps
[4975.26 → 4976.16] into God's
[4976.16 → 4976.60] plan
[4976.60 → 4977.58] without hesitation.
[4977.82 → 4978.60] She asks
[4978.60 → 4979.22] a question
[4979.22 → 4980.02] of clarification
[4980.02 → 4981.00] and then she
[4981.00 → 4981.60] doesn't bargain
[4981.60 → 4982.40] or stall
[4982.40 → 4983.04] or ask for
[4983.04 → 4983.50] more time
[4983.50 → 4983.94] to think
[4983.94 → 4983.96] to think.
[4983.96 → 4984.44] She
[4984.44 → 4985.06] yields
[4985.06 → 4987.24] and in
[4987.24 → 4987.90] so doing
[4987.90 → 4988.98] she embodies
[4988.98 → 4989.86] the posture
[4989.86 → 4990.76] of a true
[4990.76 → 4991.32] disciple.
[4992.22 → 4992.32] Right?
[4992.38 → 4993.48] An unreserved
[4993.48 → 4994.18] willingness
[4994.18 → 4995.16] to be
[4995.16 → 4996.20] the Lord's
[4996.20 → 4996.90] servant.
[4998.26 → 4998.92] Her peace
[4998.92 → 4999.62] doesn't come
[4999.62 → 5000.02] from
[5000.02 → 5001.20] predictability
[5001.20 → 5002.16] or from
[5002.16 → 5002.94] staying in
[5002.94 → 5003.70] control of
[5003.70 → 5004.12] how her
[5004.12 → 5005.26] life unfolds
[5005.26 → 5006.12] or from
[5006.12 → 5007.12] her circumstances
[5007.12 → 5007.72] aligning
[5007.72 → 5008.24] with her
[5008.24 → 5008.90] expectations.
[5009.36 → 5009.94] Her peace
[5009.94 → 5010.92] comes from
[5010.92 → 5011.90] her saying
[5011.90 → 5013.04] let it be
[5013.04 → 5013.68] to me
[5013.68 → 5014.26] according
[5014.26 → 5015.18] to your
[5015.18 → 5015.86] word.
[5017.46 → 5018.76] Her plans
[5018.76 → 5019.36] change
[5019.36 → 5020.88] but she
[5020.88 → 5021.54] remains
[5021.54 → 5022.40] held.
[5023.70 → 5024.70] Her ideas
[5024.70 → 5025.98] are transformed
[5025.98 → 5027.48] but God's
[5027.48 → 5027.92] word
[5027.92 → 5028.80] is sure.
[5030.66 → 5031.38] Mary shows
[5031.38 → 5031.94] us the
[5031.94 → 5032.58] shape of
[5032.58 → 5033.08] advent
[5033.08 → 5033.74] peace.
[5034.12 → 5034.22] Right?
[5034.28 → 5034.64] Not the
[5034.64 → 5035.64] quiet life
[5035.64 → 5037.22] the quiet
[5037.22 → 5037.80] of a life
[5037.80 → 5038.50] untroubled
[5038.50 → 5039.34] but the
[5039.34 → 5039.74] deep
[5039.74 → 5040.90] steadfast
[5040.90 → 5042.08] of a
[5042.08 → 5042.46] life
[5042.46 → 5043.22] surrendered.
[5045.92 → 5046.80] Now if
[5046.80 → 5047.40] Mary shows
[5047.40 → 5048.02] us what
[5048.02 → 5048.48] surrender
[5048.48 → 5049.20] looks like
[5049.20 → 5050.02] from within
[5050.02 → 5050.70] the disruption
[5050.70 → 5052.02] Joseph
[5052.02 → 5054.08] shows us
[5054.08 → 5054.54] what
[5054.54 → 5055.06] surrender
[5055.06 → 5055.98] looks like
[5055.98 → 5056.94] from outside
[5056.94 → 5057.42] of it
[5057.42 → 5058.28] from the
[5058.28 → 5058.96] place of
[5058.96 → 5059.46] confusion
[5059.46 → 5060.32] and hurt
[5060.32 → 5061.26] and uncertainty.
[5062.36 → 5063.06] Matthew
[5063.06 → 5064.06] now he's
[5064.06 → 5064.38] telling
[5064.38 → 5065.26] Joseph's
[5065.26 → 5065.76] side of
[5065.76 → 5066.24] the story
[5066.24 → 5066.54] and he
[5066.54 → 5066.88] does so
[5066.88 → 5067.28] with a
[5067.28 → 5067.76] remarkable
[5067.76 → 5068.54] restraint.
[5069.66 → 5070.02] Joseph
[5070.02 → 5070.52] and Mary
[5070.52 → 5071.36] again are
[5071.36 → 5071.96] already
[5071.96 → 5072.56] legally
[5072.56 → 5073.10] bound
[5073.10 → 5073.60] in
[5073.60 → 5074.44] betrothal
[5074.44 → 5075.36] and from
[5075.36 → 5075.78] his
[5075.78 → 5076.48] perspective
[5076.48 → 5076.82] from
[5076.82 → 5077.34] Joseph's
[5077.34 → 5077.74] perspective
[5077.74 → 5078.28] the path
[5078.28 → 5078.76] is clear.
[5079.28 → 5079.72] There's a
[5079.72 → 5080.46] wedding ceremony
[5080.46 → 5080.92] ahead.
[5081.26 → 5081.58] There is a
[5081.58 → 5082.04] home to
[5082.04 → 5082.42] prepare
[5082.42 → 5083.28] a future
[5083.28 → 5083.90] to build.
[5084.04 → 5084.30] Joseph
[5084.30 → 5084.82] at this
[5084.82 → 5085.32] time is
[5085.32 → 5085.82] probably
[5085.82 → 5086.92] building out
[5086.92 → 5087.38] the furniture
[5087.38 → 5087.84] he needs
[5087.84 → 5088.16] for his
[5088.16 → 5088.46] own
[5088.46 → 5089.36] family
[5089.36 → 5090.14] and life
[5090.14 → 5091.40] and then
[5091.40 → 5092.48] he learns
[5092.48 → 5093.20] that Mary
[5093.20 → 5094.00] is pregnant
[5094.00 → 5096.08] and he
[5096.08 → 5096.50] knows that
[5096.50 → 5096.80] he's not
[5096.80 → 5097.24] the father.
[5098.90 → 5099.38] Everything
[5099.38 → 5099.98] he thought
[5099.98 → 5100.72] he understood
[5100.72 → 5101.64] about life
[5101.64 → 5102.32] in that
[5102.32 → 5102.74] moment
[5102.74 → 5103.52] collapses.
[5105.66 → 5106.14] Now again
[5106.14 → 5106.78] under the
[5106.78 → 5107.16] law
[5107.16 → 5107.64] Joseph
[5107.64 → 5108.12] has
[5108.12 → 5109.24] options
[5109.24 → 5109.78] and these
[5109.78 → 5110.14] options
[5110.14 → 5110.60] include
[5110.60 → 5111.00] public
[5111.00 → 5111.82] accusation
[5111.82 → 5112.36] they include
[5112.36 → 5112.72] legal
[5112.72 → 5113.42] consequences
[5113.42 → 5114.44] they include
[5114.44 → 5114.98] the full
[5114.98 → 5115.58] weight of
[5115.58 → 5116.22] the community
[5116.22 → 5116.68] brought
[5116.68 → 5117.18] against
[5117.18 → 5117.88] Mary
[5117.88 → 5119.68] but Matthew
[5119.68 → 5120.20] describes
[5120.20 → 5120.60] Joseph
[5120.60 → 5121.58] as a
[5121.58 → 5121.94] righteous
[5121.94 → 5122.74] man
[5122.74 → 5123.00] whose
[5123.00 → 5123.54] instinct
[5123.54 → 5123.90] isn't
[5123.90 → 5124.64] to shame
[5124.64 → 5125.30] but to
[5125.30 → 5125.84] protect
[5125.84 → 5127.34] and he
[5127.34 → 5128.20] resolves
[5128.20 → 5128.60] to then
[5128.60 → 5129.48] dissolve
[5129.48 → 5130.60] the betrothal
[5130.60 → 5131.22] quietly
[5131.22 → 5131.88] to divorce
[5131.88 → 5132.56] her quietly
[5132.56 → 5133.50] to shoulder
[5133.50 → 5134.32] the confusion
[5134.32 → 5134.94] himself
[5134.94 → 5135.78] and to
[5135.78 → 5137.90] spare her
[5137.90 → 5138.48] as much
[5138.48 → 5138.78] of the
[5138.78 → 5139.30] disgrace
[5139.30 → 5139.78] as he
[5139.78 → 5140.00] can
[5140.00 → 5141.62] but then
[5141.62 → 5142.28] God
[5142.28 → 5143.08] interrupts
[5143.08 → 5143.48] him
[5143.48 → 5144.12] too
[5144.12 → 5145.98] an angel
[5145.98 → 5146.46] appears to
[5146.46 → 5147.08] him in a
[5147.08 → 5147.46] dream
[5147.46 → 5148.26] and tells
[5148.26 → 5148.50] him
[5148.50 → 5148.90] what he
[5148.90 → 5149.34] cannot
[5149.34 → 5149.98] possibly
[5149.98 → 5150.28] have
[5150.28 → 5150.60] guessed
[5150.60 → 5150.80] that
[5150.80 → 5151.22] this
[5151.22 → 5151.66] child
[5151.66 → 5151.90] is
[5151.90 → 5152.04] from
[5152.04 → 5152.18] the
[5152.18 → 5152.38] Holy
[5152.38 → 5152.88] Spirit
[5152.88 → 5153.52] that
[5153.52 → 5153.80] Mary
[5153.80 → 5154.20] has
[5154.20 → 5154.44] been
[5154.44 → 5154.94] faithful
[5154.94 → 5155.36] and
[5155.36 → 5155.54] that
[5155.54 → 5155.86] Joseph
[5155.86 → 5156.14] is
[5156.14 → 5156.40] being
[5156.40 → 5156.74] called
[5156.74 → 5157.02] into
[5157.02 → 5157.28] a
[5157.28 → 5157.60] story
[5157.60 → 5158.36] far
[5158.36 → 5158.94] greater
[5158.94 → 5159.28] and
[5159.28 → 5159.72] larger
[5159.72 → 5160.22] than
[5160.22 → 5160.34] he
[5160.34 → 5160.50] could
[5160.50 → 5160.88] imagine
[5160.88 → 5162.16] and it's
[5162.16 → 5162.66] a call
[5162.66 → 5163.76] that will
[5163.76 → 5164.24] reshape
[5164.24 → 5165.06] his life
[5165.06 → 5166.42] even as
[5166.42 → 5167.20] it reshapes
[5167.20 → 5167.90] Mary's
[5167.90 → 5168.56] a call
[5168.56 → 5169.86] to take
[5169.86 → 5170.28] Mary
[5170.28 → 5170.74] as his
[5170.74 → 5171.06] wife
[5171.06 → 5171.42] and to
[5171.42 → 5171.84] embrace
[5171.84 → 5172.44] the child
[5172.44 → 5172.78] that she
[5172.78 → 5173.18] carries
[5173.18 → 5173.82] to name
[5173.82 → 5174.08] him
[5174.08 → 5174.60] Jesus
[5174.60 → 5175.82] the one
[5175.82 → 5176.26] who will
[5176.26 → 5176.58] save
[5176.58 → 5177.26] his people
[5177.26 → 5177.78] from
[5177.78 → 5178.00] their
[5178.00 → 5178.36] sins
[5178.36 → 5180.40] now
[5180.40 → 5180.76] again
[5180.76 → 5181.12] I think
[5181.12 → 5181.28] it's
[5181.28 → 5181.50] really
[5181.50 → 5182.00] important
[5182.00 → 5182.44] for us
[5182.44 → 5182.68] to
[5182.68 → 5183.32] to
[5183.32 → 5183.66] wrestle
[5183.66 → 5184.22] with
[5184.22 → 5184.66] how
[5184.66 → 5185.44] costly
[5185.44 → 5186.22] this
[5186.22 → 5186.76] obedience
[5186.76 → 5187.50] is
[5187.50 → 5189.76] by taking
[5189.76 → 5190.22] Mary
[5190.22 → 5190.72] as his
[5190.72 → 5191.16] wife
[5191.16 → 5191.58] Joseph
[5191.58 → 5191.98] is
[5191.98 → 5192.70] publicly
[5192.70 → 5193.36] accepting
[5193.36 → 5194.28] the shame
[5194.28 → 5195.16] that others
[5195.16 → 5195.92] will assume
[5195.92 → 5196.38] belongs
[5196.38 → 5196.80] to him
[5196.80 → 5198.60] he's
[5198.60 → 5198.86] stepping
[5198.86 → 5199.40] into a
[5199.40 → 5199.78] lifetime
[5199.78 → 5200.88] of sideways
[5200.88 → 5201.90] glances
[5201.90 → 5203.14] of whispered
[5203.14 → 5203.68] judgments
[5203.68 → 5204.48] and questions
[5204.48 → 5205.24] that he
[5205.24 → 5205.54] cannot
[5205.54 → 5205.94] answer
[5205.94 → 5208.26] and we
[5208.26 → 5208.80] know that
[5208.80 → 5209.34] this shame
[5209.34 → 5210.20] didn't simply
[5210.20 → 5211.06] hover over
[5211.06 → 5211.50] Joseph
[5211.50 → 5212.12] it also
[5212.12 → 5212.46] hovered
[5212.46 → 5212.70] over
[5212.70 → 5213.14] Mary
[5213.14 → 5214.06] and
[5214.06 → 5214.88] in fact
[5214.88 → 5215.60] it follows
[5215.60 → 5216.06] Jesus
[5216.06 → 5216.64] into
[5216.64 → 5217.30] adulthood
[5217.30 → 5219.18] the gospel
[5219.18 → 5219.78] of John
[5219.78 → 5220.42] records a
[5220.42 → 5220.76] story
[5220.76 → 5221.96] and in
[5221.96 → 5222.62] that moment
[5222.62 → 5223.26] Jesus
[5223.26 → 5224.16] is confronted
[5224.16 → 5224.70] by a
[5224.70 → 5225.08] hostile
[5225.08 → 5225.74] crowd
[5225.74 → 5226.92] and they
[5226.92 → 5227.54] say to
[5227.54 → 5227.92] Jesus
[5227.92 → 5228.64] as part
[5228.64 → 5228.90] of their
[5228.90 → 5229.40] exchange
[5229.40 → 5230.20] we are
[5230.20 → 5230.52] not
[5230.52 → 5231.26] illegitimate
[5231.26 → 5231.72] children
[5231.72 → 5233.72] this is
[5233.72 → 5233.96] John
[5233.96 → 5234.28] 8
[5234.28 → 5234.74] 41
[5234.74 → 5236.00] and so
[5236.00 → 5236.36] this is
[5236.36 → 5237.00] more than
[5237.00 → 5238.16] a theological
[5238.16 → 5239.00] posturing
[5239.00 → 5239.98] it is a
[5239.98 → 5240.34] pointed
[5240.34 → 5240.94] reminder
[5240.94 → 5241.70] to Jesus
[5241.70 → 5242.70] about the
[5242.70 → 5243.04] rumours
[5243.04 → 5244.02] that have
[5244.02 → 5244.74] gone around
[5244.74 → 5245.42] surrounding
[5245.42 → 5246.02] his birth
[5246.02 → 5247.18] right
[5247.18 → 5247.88] the suspicion
[5247.88 → 5248.58] that Joseph
[5248.58 → 5249.14] feared
[5249.14 → 5249.72] the whispers
[5249.72 → 5250.08] that he
[5250.08 → 5250.52] absorbed
[5250.52 → 5251.14] into himself
[5251.14 → 5251.72] so that
[5251.72 → 5252.20] Mary would
[5252.20 → 5252.54] not bear
[5252.54 → 5253.04] them alone
[5253.04 → 5253.68] the shadows
[5253.68 → 5254.60] cast over
[5254.60 → 5255.12] his family
[5255.12 → 5255.98] all of it
[5255.98 → 5256.64] resurfaces
[5256.64 → 5256.98] here
[5256.98 → 5257.70] decades
[5257.70 → 5258.10] later
[5258.10 → 5258.60] and an
[5258.60 → 5259.08] insult
[5259.08 → 5259.62] aimed at
[5259.62 → 5260.02] Jesus
[5260.02 → 5262.04] Joseph's
[5262.04 → 5262.46] anxiety
[5262.46 → 5262.82] in this
[5262.82 → 5263.12] moment
[5263.12 → 5263.66] is not
[5263.66 → 5264.26] imaginary
[5264.26 → 5265.30] the social
[5265.30 → 5265.86] cost
[5265.86 → 5266.60] is real
[5266.60 → 5267.14] and it
[5267.14 → 5267.72] lands not
[5267.72 → 5268.28] only on
[5268.28 → 5268.62] him
[5268.62 → 5269.16] but also
[5269.16 → 5269.50] on the
[5269.50 → 5269.96] child
[5269.96 → 5270.50] that he
[5270.50 → 5270.66] is
[5270.66 → 5270.98] commanded
[5270.98 → 5271.48] to raise
[5271.48 → 5273.62] Joseph's
[5273.62 → 5274.14] obedience
[5274.14 → 5275.18] just like
[5275.18 → 5275.74] Mary's
[5275.74 → 5275.98] means
[5275.98 → 5276.50] willingly
[5276.50 → 5277.04] stepping
[5277.04 → 5277.38] into
[5277.38 → 5278.18] a story
[5278.18 → 5279.12] that others
[5279.12 → 5279.40] would
[5279.40 → 5280.48] weaponize
[5280.48 → 5280.86] against
[5280.86 → 5281.52] his family
[5281.52 → 5282.46] for years
[5282.46 → 5284.46] and Jesus
[5284.46 → 5284.98] himself
[5284.98 → 5285.80] as an
[5285.80 → 5286.24] adult
[5286.24 → 5287.32] bore
[5287.32 → 5288.20] the echo
[5288.20 → 5288.86] of the
[5288.86 → 5289.40] shame
[5289.40 → 5289.86] Joseph
[5289.86 → 5290.20] had
[5290.20 → 5290.72] absorbed
[5290.72 → 5291.08] and
[5291.08 → 5291.64] protected
[5291.64 → 5292.64] Mary
[5292.64 → 5293.00] from
[5293.00 → 5294.50] and yet
[5294.50 → 5295.00] Joseph
[5295.00 → 5296.24] obeys
[5296.24 → 5297.24] anyway
[5297.24 → 5300.28] Matthew
[5300.28 → 5300.62] writes
[5300.62 → 5300.96] that when
[5300.96 → 5301.42] Joseph
[5301.42 → 5301.78] wakes
[5301.78 → 5301.98] from
[5301.98 → 5302.14] the
[5302.14 → 5302.44] dream
[5302.44 → 5302.74] he
[5302.74 → 5302.92] does
[5302.92 → 5303.36] exactly
[5303.36 → 5303.64] as
[5303.64 → 5303.80] the
[5303.80 → 5304.08] angel
[5304.08 → 5304.62] commands
[5304.62 → 5305.16] no
[5305.16 → 5305.64] delays
[5305.64 → 5305.98] no
[5305.98 → 5306.44] hedging
[5306.44 → 5306.92] no
[5306.92 → 5307.28] attempt
[5307.28 → 5307.52] to
[5307.52 → 5307.88] preserve
[5307.88 → 5308.12] his
[5308.12 → 5308.44] image
[5308.44 → 5308.82] he
[5308.82 → 5309.34] receives
[5309.34 → 5309.80] God's
[5309.80 → 5310.08] will
[5310.08 → 5310.36] as
[5310.36 → 5310.52] the
[5310.52 → 5310.74] new
[5310.74 → 5311.10] shape
[5311.10 → 5311.34] of
[5311.34 → 5311.58] his
[5311.58 → 5312.00] life
[5312.00 → 5313.52] Joseph
[5313.52 → 5313.76] is
[5313.76 → 5313.98] showing
[5313.98 → 5314.18] us
[5314.18 → 5314.42] another
[5314.42 → 5314.94] face
[5314.94 → 5315.30] of
[5315.30 → 5315.78] advent
[5315.78 → 5316.40] peace
[5316.40 → 5316.92] right
[5316.92 → 5317.20] it's
[5317.20 → 5317.36] not
[5317.36 → 5317.80] the peace
[5317.80 → 5317.94] of
[5317.94 → 5318.58] understanding
[5318.58 → 5319.20] everything
[5319.20 → 5319.82] that God
[5319.82 → 5320.56] is doing
[5320.56 → 5320.78] it's
[5320.78 → 5320.92] not
[5320.92 → 5321.32] the peace
[5321.32 → 5321.72] of having
[5321.72 → 5322.14] all your
[5322.14 → 5322.54] questions
[5322.54 → 5322.96] resolved
[5322.96 → 5323.50] it's
[5323.50 → 5323.94] the peace
[5323.94 → 5324.70] of trust
[5324.70 → 5325.46] entrusting
[5325.46 → 5326.12] your name
[5326.12 → 5326.50] and your
[5326.50 → 5326.90] future
[5326.90 → 5327.30] and your
[5327.30 → 5327.64] place
[5327.64 → 5328.02] in the
[5328.02 → 5328.32] world
[5328.32 → 5329.12] to the
[5329.12 → 5329.50] God
[5329.50 → 5329.80] whose
[5329.80 → 5330.36] wisdom
[5330.36 → 5331.14] exceeds
[5331.14 → 5331.60] our
[5331.60 → 5332.44] understanding
[5332.44 → 5334.38] Mary
[5334.38 → 5334.96] yields
[5334.96 → 5335.24] with
[5335.24 → 5335.58] open
[5335.58 → 5336.00] hands
[5336.00 → 5336.56] and
[5336.56 → 5337.06] Joseph
[5337.06 → 5338.08] yields
[5338.08 → 5338.38] with
[5338.38 → 5338.78] wounded
[5338.78 → 5339.16] but
[5339.16 → 5339.64] obedient
[5339.64 → 5340.46] trust
[5340.46 → 5340.72] and
[5340.72 → 5341.14] together
[5341.14 → 5341.90] they
[5341.90 → 5342.20] show
[5342.20 → 5342.62] us
[5342.62 → 5343.84] that
[5343.84 → 5344.12] true
[5344.12 → 5344.58] peace
[5344.58 → 5344.98] comes
[5344.98 → 5345.22] not
[5345.22 → 5345.40] from
[5345.40 → 5345.64] having
[5345.64 → 5345.84] our
[5345.84 → 5346.16] plans
[5346.16 → 5346.64] confirmed
[5346.64 → 5347.48] but
[5347.48 → 5347.76] from
[5347.76 → 5348.10] having
[5348.10 → 5348.38] our
[5348.38 → 5348.76] lives
[5348.76 → 5349.62] reordered
[5349.62 → 5349.92] by
[5349.92 → 5350.14] the
[5350.14 → 5350.44] will
[5350.44 → 5351.18] of
[5351.18 → 5351.52] God
[5351.52 → 5353.94] now
[5353.94 → 5355.76] when
[5355.76 → 5356.06] we look
[5356.06 → 5356.16] at
[5356.16 → 5356.36] Mary
[5356.36 → 5356.54] and
[5356.54 → 5356.88] Joseph
[5356.88 → 5358.00] it's
[5358.00 → 5358.76] tempting
[5358.76 → 5359.16] to
[5359.16 → 5359.56] admire
[5359.56 → 5360.00] them
[5360.00 → 5360.68] from
[5360.68 → 5360.86] a
[5360.86 → 5361.28] distance
[5361.28 → 5361.52] to
[5361.52 → 5361.80] see
[5361.80 → 5362.14] them
[5362.14 → 5362.36] as
[5362.36 → 5363.12] unusually
[5363.12 → 5363.68] brave
[5363.68 → 5364.36] unusually
[5364.36 → 5364.92] faithful
[5364.92 → 5365.58] and
[5365.58 → 5366.04] uniquely
[5366.04 → 5366.72] prepared
[5366.72 → 5367.20] for
[5367.20 → 5367.42] this
[5367.42 → 5367.84] moment
[5367.84 → 5368.80] and
[5368.80 → 5368.96] to
[5368.96 → 5369.16] be
[5369.16 → 5369.58] clear
[5369.58 → 5370.12] Mary
[5370.12 → 5370.32] is
[5370.32 → 5370.72] introduced
[5370.72 → 5371.02] to
[5371.02 → 5371.18] us
[5371.18 → 5371.32] as
[5371.32 → 5371.52] one
[5371.52 → 5371.72] who
[5371.72 → 5371.94] is
[5371.94 → 5372.56] highly
[5372.56 → 5373.48] favoured
[5373.48 → 5374.52] by
[5374.52 → 5374.92] God
[5374.92 → 5377.98] but
[5377.98 → 5379.20] the
[5379.20 → 5379.54] question
[5379.54 → 5380.10] becomes
[5380.10 → 5380.36] did
[5380.36 → 5380.54] she
[5380.54 → 5380.96] merit
[5380.96 → 5381.28] that
[5381.28 → 5381.64] favour
[5381.64 → 5381.90] or
[5381.90 → 5382.06] did
[5382.06 → 5382.18] she
[5382.18 → 5382.44] just
[5382.44 → 5382.90] receive
[5382.90 → 5383.20] it
[5383.20 → 5385.04] right
[5385.04 → 5385.32] because
[5385.32 → 5385.56] to
[5385.56 → 5386.04] think
[5386.04 → 5386.30] that
[5386.30 → 5386.64] they
[5386.64 → 5387.38] are
[5387.38 → 5387.92] anything
[5387.92 → 5388.42] other
[5388.42 → 5388.70] than
[5388.70 → 5389.26] ordinary
[5389.26 → 5389.78] people
[5389.78 → 5390.30] who
[5390.30 → 5390.50] are
[5390.50 → 5390.94] yielding
[5390.94 → 5391.30] themselves
[5391.30 → 5391.48] to
[5391.48 → 5391.62] an
[5391.62 → 5392.04] extraordinary
[5392.04 → 5392.54] God
[5392.54 → 5393.16] is
[5393.16 → 5393.42] to
[5393.42 → 5393.96] mistake
[5393.96 → 5394.16] the
[5394.16 → 5394.38] point
[5394.38 → 5394.48] of
[5394.48 → 5394.60] the
[5394.60 → 5395.00] story
[5395.00 → 5396.04] right
[5396.04 → 5396.24] Mary
[5396.24 → 5396.42] and
[5396.42 → 5396.64] Joseph
[5396.64 → 5396.90] are
[5396.90 → 5397.10] not
[5397.10 → 5397.46] super
[5397.46 → 5397.78] human
[5397.78 → 5398.10] Mary
[5398.10 → 5398.58] is
[5398.58 → 5398.78] an
[5398.78 → 5399.22] ordinary
[5399.22 → 5399.62] woman
[5399.62 → 5399.84] who
[5399.84 → 5400.00] is
[5400.00 → 5400.68] extraordinarily
[5400.68 → 5401.44] blessed
[5401.44 → 5401.90] to
[5401.90 → 5402.24] become
[5402.24 → 5402.48] the
[5402.48 → 5402.70] mother
[5402.70 → 5402.96] of
[5402.96 → 5403.32] God
[5403.32 → 5404.14] and
[5404.14 → 5404.42] Mary
[5404.42 → 5404.60] and
[5404.60 → 5404.88] Joseph
[5404.88 → 5405.10] are
[5405.10 → 5405.44] ordinary
[5405.44 → 5405.90] people
[5405.90 → 5406.14] whose
[5406.14 → 5406.54] lives
[5406.54 → 5406.72] are
[5406.72 → 5407.20] upended
[5407.20 → 5407.48] by
[5407.48 → 5407.84] God's
[5407.84 → 5408.16] call
[5408.16 → 5408.40] and
[5408.40 → 5408.60] who
[5408.60 → 5408.96] yet
[5408.96 → 5409.74] trust
[5409.74 → 5410.16] him
[5410.16 → 5410.76] enough
[5410.76 → 5411.04] to
[5411.04 → 5411.42] yield
[5411.42 → 5411.96] themselves
[5411.96 → 5412.54] to
[5412.54 → 5412.76] his
[5412.76 → 5413.02] will
[5413.02 → 5413.84] right
[5413.84 → 5414.08] their
[5414.08 → 5414.50] obedience
[5414.50 → 5414.86] is
[5414.86 → 5415.06] not
[5415.06 → 5415.26] the
[5415.26 → 5415.72] cause
[5415.72 → 5416.02] of
[5416.02 → 5416.40] God's
[5416.40 → 5416.66] peace
[5416.66 → 5416.86] in
[5416.86 → 5416.98] their
[5416.98 → 5417.22] lives
[5417.22 → 5417.36] it
[5417.36 → 5417.48] is
[5417.48 → 5417.68] the
[5417.68 → 5418.08] fruit
[5418.08 → 5418.52] of
[5418.52 → 5418.88] knowing
[5418.88 → 5419.44] God
[5419.44 → 5419.88] and
[5419.88 → 5420.16] knowing
[5420.16 → 5420.38] the
[5420.38 → 5420.72] God
[5420.72 → 5420.90] who
[5420.90 → 5421.50] holds
[5421.50 → 5421.88] them
[5421.88 → 5422.20] in
[5422.20 → 5422.60] his
[5422.60 → 5423.18] hands
[5423.18 → 5424.50] right
[5424.50 → 5424.84] underneath
[5424.84 → 5425.26] their
[5425.26 → 5425.80] surrender
[5425.80 → 5426.16] is
[5426.16 → 5426.54] something
[5426.54 → 5427.74] deeper
[5427.74 → 5428.88] underneath
[5428.88 → 5429.18] their
[5429.18 → 5429.64] surrender
[5429.64 → 5429.92] is
[5429.92 → 5430.14] the
[5430.14 → 5430.46] love
[5430.46 → 5430.70] of
[5430.70 → 5431.14] God
[5431.14 → 5431.36] that
[5431.36 → 5431.50] is
[5431.50 → 5431.84] moving
[5431.84 → 5432.46] towards
[5434.42 → 5434.90] their
[5434.90 → 5435.64] understanding
[5435.64 → 5436.46] a love
[5436.46 → 5436.58] that
[5436.58 → 5436.84] doesn't
[5436.84 → 5437.20] depend
[5437.20 → 5437.44] on
[5437.44 → 5437.60] their
[5437.60 → 5438.00] strength
[5438.00 → 5438.20] it's
[5438.20 → 5438.56] a love
[5438.56 → 5438.76] that
[5438.76 → 5439.20] steps

[5491.14 → 5491.66] costs
[5491.66 → 5492.06] him
[5492.06 → 5493.02] everything

[5627.36 → 5628.86] I
[5628.86 → 5629.26] was
[5629.26 → 5629.56] at
[5629.56 → 5629.98] a
[5629.98 → 5630.28] prayer
[5630.28 → 5630.86] gathering
[5630.86 → 5632.04] for
[5632.04 → 5632.46] Langley
[5632.46 → 5632.84] area
[5632.84 → 5633.30] pastors
[5633.30 → 5636.34] I
[5636.34 → 5636.48] had
[5636.48 → 5636.66] just
[5636.66 → 5636.90] come
[5636.90 → 5637.32] through
[5637.32 → 5637.92] a
[5637.92 → 5638.22] really
[5638.22 → 5638.70] hectic
[5638.70 → 5639.36] three
[5639.36 → 5639.74] months
[5639.74 → 5640.06] of
[5640.06 → 5640.46] life
[5640.46 → 5641.26] which
[5641.26 → 5641.70] followed
[5641.70 → 5642.06] on the
[5642.06 → 5642.40] heels
[5642.40 → 5642.70] of
[5642.70 → 5642.88] a
[5642.88 → 5643.22] summer
[5643.22 → 5643.80] of
[5643.80 → 5644.22] lots
[5644.22 → 5644.48] and
[5644.48 → 5644.82] lots
[5644.82 → 5645.06] and
[5645.06 → 5645.42] lots
[5645.42 → 5645.66] of
[5645.66 → 5646.08] things
[5646.08 → 5646.76] and
[5646.76 → 5646.90] a
[5646.90 → 5647.48] busyness
[5647.48 → 5649.26] that
[5649.26 → 5649.58] in
[5649.58 → 5649.88] my
[5649.88 → 5650.54] experience
[5650.54 → 5650.92] was
[5650.92 → 5652.04] very
[5652.04 → 5652.40] heightened
[5652.40 → 5652.74] was
[5652.74 → 5653.04] perhaps
[5653.04 → 5653.74] incomparable
[5653.74 → 5655.48] that
[5655.48 → 5655.78] was
[5655.78 → 5655.92] a
[5655.92 → 5656.16] summer
[5656.16 → 5656.46] of
[5656.46 → 5656.76] no
[5656.76 → 5657.42] real
[5657.42 → 5658.06] long
[5658.06 → 5658.44] term
[5658.44 → 5659.14] rest
[5659.14 → 5660.70] I
[5660.70 → 5660.84] was
[5660.84 → 5661.14] tired
[5661.14 → 5663.48] and
[5663.48 → 5663.74] now
[5663.74 → 5663.98] it
[5663.98 → 5664.14] was
[5664.14 → 5664.54] November
[5664.54 → 5666.22] I
[5666.22 → 5666.34] had
[5666.34 → 5666.54] made
[5666.54 → 5666.68] it
[5666.68 → 5666.90] through
[5666.90 → 5667.10] the
[5667.10 → 5667.42] calendar
[5667.42 → 5667.64] of
[5667.64 → 5668.20] chaos
[5668.20 → 5669.32] and
[5669.32 → 5669.42] I
[5669.42 → 5669.56] had
[5669.56 → 5669.74] just
[5669.74 → 5669.94] been
[5669.94 → 5670.22] telling
[5670.22 → 5670.74] myself
[5670.74 → 5671.14] for
[5671.14 → 5671.48] six
[5671.48 → 5671.84] months
[5671.84 → 5672.38] if
[5672.38 → 5672.54] I
[5672.54 → 5672.70] can
[5672.70 → 5672.92] just
[5672.92 → 5673.16] make
[5673.16 → 5673.28] it
[5673.28 → 5673.44] to
[5673.44 → 5673.78] November
[5673.78 → 5674.22] 12
[5674.22 → 5675.30] things
[5675.30 → 5675.48] will
[5675.48 → 5675.70] settle
[5675.70 → 5675.98] down
[5675.98 → 5676.24] after
[5676.24 → 5676.56] that
[5676.56 → 5678.50] maybe
[5678.50 → 5678.82] then
[5678.82 → 5679.00] I'll
[5679.00 → 5679.16] have
[5679.16 → 5679.38] some
[5679.38 → 5679.74] peace
[5679.74 → 5682.44] but
[5682.44 → 5682.62] that
[5682.62 → 5683.08] Wednesday
[5683.08 → 5684.54] at
[5684.54 → 5684.74] that

[5685.22 → 5685.44] prayer
[5685.44 → 5685.86] meeting
[5685.86 → 5689.08] I
[5689.08 → 5689.28] felt
[5689.28 → 5689.44] the
[5689.44 → 5689.60] Holy
[5689.60 → 5689.96] Spirit
[5689.96 → 5690.42] convict
[5690.42 → 5690.58] me
[5690.58 → 5690.74] of
[5690.74 → 5691.06] something
[5691.06 → 5691.94] that
[5691.94 → 5692.80] my
[5692.80 → 5693.18] wife
[5693.18 → 5693.64] had
[5693.64 → 5694.06] already
[5694.06 → 5694.26] been

[5697.12 → 5697.28] you
[5697.28 → 5697.58] husbands
[5697.58 → 5697.84] out
[5697.84 → 5698.06] there
[5698.06 → 5698.54] this
[5698.54 → 5698.68] is
[5698.68 → 5698.82] the
[5698.82 → 5699.02] normal
[5699.02 → 5699.34] pattern
[5699.34 → 5699.52] of
[5699.52 → 5699.80] things
[5699.80 → 5701.50] your
[5701.50 → 5701.70] wife
[5701.70 → 5701.84] has
[5701.84 → 5701.94] been
[5701.94 → 5702.20] telling
[5702.20 → 5702.52] you
[5702.52 → 5703.28] and
[5703.28 → 5703.40] you
[5703.40 → 5703.56] only
[5703.56 → 5703.80] listen
[5703.80 → 5703.94] when
[5703.94 → 5704.04] the
[5704.04 → 5704.16] Holy
[5704.16 → 5704.40] Spirit
[5704.40 → 5704.66] does

[5707.56 → 5707.74] Spirit
[5707.74 → 5708.16] convict
[5708.16 → 5708.42] me
[5708.42 → 5708.64] that
[5708.64 → 5708.82] the
[5708.82 → 5709.26] cost
[5709.26 → 5709.50] of
[5709.50 → 5709.74] my
[5709.74 → 5710.52] busyness
[5710.52 → 5712.02] was
[5712.02 → 5712.30] not
[5712.30 → 5712.70] born
[5712.70 → 5713.00] by

[5722.62 → 5725.22] they
[5725.22 → 5725.52] feel
[5725.52 → 5725.68] the
[5725.68 → 5725.86] weight
[5725.86 → 5726.00] of
[5726.00 → 5726.26] that
[5726.26 → 5728.46] they

[5734.44 → 5734.78] to
[5734.78 → 5735.10] rest
[5735.10 → 5735.70] trickles
[5735.70 → 5736.10] out
[5736.10 → 5737.04] to
[5737.04 → 5737.34] them

[5754.98 → 5755.42] this
[5755.42 → 5756.04] truth
[5756.04 → 5758.34] the
[5758.34 → 5758.80] truth
[5758.80 → 5759.76] that
[5759.76 → 5760.22] my
[5760.22 → 5760.88] restless

[5762.80 → 5763.44] answered
[5763.44 → 5764.30] only
[5764.30 → 5765.02] by
[5765.02 → 5765.52] Jesus
[5765.52 → 5766.38] willing
[5766.38 → 5767.30] surrender
[5767.30 → 5769.48] that
[5769.48 → 5769.96] his
[5769.96 → 5770.60] obedience
[5770.60 → 5771.52] is
[5771.52 → 5771.76] the
[5771.76 → 5772.24] peace
[5772.24 → 5772.78] that
[5772.78 → 5773.10] I
[5773.10 → 5773.40] keep
[5773.40 → 5773.76] trying
[5773.76 → 5773.98] to
[5773.98 → 5774.56] manufacture
[5774.56 → 5778.92] when
[5778.92 → 5779.10] I
[5779.10 → 5779.30] keep
[5779.30 → 5779.68] trying
[5779.68 → 5779.92] to
[5779.92 → 5780.22] push
[5780.22 → 5780.48] for
[5780.48 → 5780.82] peace
[5780.82 → 5781.06] by
[5781.06 → 5781.50] controlling
[5781.50 → 5781.80] my
[5781.80 → 5782.26] time
[5782.26 → 5782.66] my
[5782.66 → 5783.00] energy
[5783.00 → 5783.24] my

[5783.66 → 5783.92] my
[5783.92 → 5784.42] outcomes
[5784.42 → 5784.88] what
[5784.88 → 5785.02] I'm
[5785.02 → 5785.38] really
[5785.38 → 5785.68] trying
[5785.68 → 5785.84] to
[5785.84 → 5786.06] do
[5786.06 → 5786.32] is
[5786.32 → 5786.78] manufacture
[5786.78 → 5787.44] something
[5787.44 → 5787.98] that
[5787.98 → 5788.32] only
[5788.32 → 5788.66] Jesus
[5788.66 → 5788.90] can
[5788.90 → 5789.20] give
[5789.20 → 5791.70] and
[5791.70 → 5791.86] this
[5791.86 → 5791.98] is
[5791.98 → 5792.12] where
[5792.12 → 5792.26] the
[5792.26 → 5792.68] gospel
[5792.68 → 5793.34] moves
[5793.34 → 5793.78] for
[5793.78 → 5794.16] me
[5794.16 → 5794.64] from
[5794.64 → 5794.82] a
[5794.82 → 5795.22] doctrine
[5795.22 → 5795.52] that
[5795.52 → 5795.68] I
[5795.68 → 5796.14] preach
[5796.14 → 5796.64] to
[5796.64 → 5796.82] a
[5796.82 → 5797.44] reality
[5797.44 → 5797.80] that
[5797.80 → 5797.92] I
[5797.92 → 5798.08] can
[5798.08 → 5798.48] rest
[5798.48 → 5798.86] in
[5798.86 → 5800.54] right
[5800.54 → 5800.82] Jesus
[5800.82 → 5801.18] didn't
[5801.18 → 5801.46] come
[5801.46 → 5801.98] simply
[5801.98 → 5802.30] to
[5802.30 → 5802.88] stop
[5802.88 → 5803.20] me
[5803.20 → 5803.62] from
[5803.62 → 5804.16] striving
[5804.16 → 5804.52] he
[5804.52 → 5804.82] came
[5804.82 → 5805.04] to
[5805.04 → 5805.60] replace
[5805.60 → 5806.00] my
[5806.00 → 5806.50] striving
[5806.50 → 5807.32] with
[5807.32 → 5807.82] his
[5807.82 → 5808.46] surrender
[5808.46 → 5810.74] right
[5810.74 → 5811.00] he
[5811.00 → 5811.64] obeyed
[5811.64 → 5811.84] where
[5811.84 → 5812.16] I
[5812.16 → 5812.66] grasp
[5812.66 → 5813.14] he
[5813.14 → 5813.78] yielded
[5813.78 → 5813.94] where
[5813.94 → 5814.16] I
[5814.16 → 5814.50] tighten
[5814.50 → 5814.76] my
[5814.76 → 5815.18] fists
[5815.18 → 5815.60] he
[5815.60 → 5816.00] trusted
[5816.00 → 5816.22] the
[5816.22 → 5816.50] father
[5816.50 → 5816.78] where
[5816.78 → 5816.96] I
[5816.96 → 5817.24] tried
[5817.24 → 5817.42] to
[5817.42 → 5817.72] hold
[5817.72 → 5818.32] everything
[5818.32 → 5818.76] together
[5818.76 → 5819.22] on
[5819.22 → 5819.40] my
[5819.40 → 5819.64] own
[5819.64 → 5820.08] strength
[5820.08 → 5820.56] and
[5820.56 → 5820.90] because
[5820.90 → 5821.64] I
[5821.64 → 5821.90] am
[5821.90 → 5822.36] united
[5822.36 → 5822.92] to
[5822.92 → 5823.30] him
[5823.30 → 5823.96] his
[5823.96 → 5824.54] obedience
[5824.54 → 5824.92] is
[5824.92 → 5825.12] not
[5825.12 → 5825.36] just
[5825.36 → 5825.52] an
[5825.52 → 5826.10] example
[5826.10 → 5826.50] set
[5826.50 → 5826.94] before
[5826.94 → 5827.24] me
[5827.24 → 5828.48] that's
[5828.48 → 5828.62] the
[5828.62 → 5829.02] difference
[5829.02 → 5829.34] between
[5829.34 → 5829.76] Jesus
[5829.76 → 5830.52] and

[5833.02 → 5833.24] are
[5833.24 → 5833.38] an
[5833.38 → 5833.76] example
[5833.76 → 5834.00] to
[5834.00 → 5834.28] me
[5834.28 → 5835.00] Jesus
[5835.00 → 5836.02] is
[5836.02 → 5837.00] to
[5837.00 → 5837.30] me
[5837.30 → 5838.94] it
[5838.94 → 5839.08] is
[5839.08 → 5839.30] a
[5839.30 → 5839.58] gift
[5839.58 → 5839.94] given
[5839.94 → 5840.18] to
[5840.18 → 5840.40] me
[5840.40 → 5840.58] and
[5840.58 → 5840.74] a
[5840.74 → 5841.04] peace
[5841.04 → 5841.26] that
[5841.26 → 5841.68] flows
[5841.68 → 5842.38] into
[5842.38 → 5842.72] me
[5842.72 → 5843.16] I
[5843.16 → 5843.38] don't
[5843.38 → 5843.70] gain
[5843.70 → 5844.10] peace
[5844.10 → 5844.32] by
[5844.32 → 5844.72] managing
[5844.72 → 5845.00] my
[5845.00 → 5845.40] world
[5845.40 → 5845.60] but

[5845.80 → 5846.16] belonging
[5846.16 → 5846.38] to
[5846.38 → 5846.54] the
[5846.54 → 5846.76] one
[5846.76 → 5847.02] who's
[5847.02 → 5847.40] already
[5848.32 → 5848.44] through
[5848.44 → 5848.62] his

[5859.60 → 5859.74] you
[5859.74 → 5859.98] this

[5860.58 → 5860.94] still
[5860.94 → 5861.38] learning
[5861.38 → 5863.24] I
[5863.24 → 5863.36] don't
[5863.36 → 5863.52] have
[5863.52 → 5863.60] it
[5863.60 → 5863.76] all
[5863.76 → 5864.00] figured
[5864.00 → 5864.28] out
[5864.28 → 5864.56] far
[5864.56 → 5864.88] from
[5864.88 → 5865.12] it
[5865.12 → 5867.42] but

[5867.52 → 5867.84] trying
[5867.84 → 5869.84] I'm
[5869.84 → 5870.00] talking
[5870.00 → 5870.18] to my
[5870.18 → 5870.42] wife
[5870.42 → 5870.66] about
[5870.66 → 5870.86] what

[5888.96 → 5890.00] peace
[5890.00 → 5890.80] that
[5890.80 → 5891.18] I
[5891.18 → 5891.42] am

[5899.30 → 5899.42] to
[5899.42 → 5899.54] get
[5899.54 → 5899.66] it
[5899.66 → 5900.00] together
[5900.00 → 5901.20] he
[5901.20 → 5901.56] meets
[5901.56 → 5901.78] me
[5901.78 → 5902.10] right
[5902.10 → 5902.26] in
[5902.26 → 5902.42] the
[5902.42 → 5902.90] chaos
[5902.90 → 5903.10] that
[5903.10 → 5903.30] I
[5903.30 → 5903.46] have
[5903.46 → 5903.92] created
[5903.92 → 5904.36] and
[5904.36 → 5904.50] he
[5904.50 → 5904.82] gives
[5904.82 → 5905.02] me
[5905.02 → 5905.54] himself
[5905.54 → 5908.26] and

[5917.56 → 5917.76] that
[5917.76 → 5917.94] I
[5917.94 → 5918.20] cannot
[5918.20 → 5918.78] generate
[5918.78 → 5919.06] is
[5919.06 → 5919.40] available
[5919.40 → 5919.82] because
[5919.82 → 5920.40] I
[5920.40 → 5920.88] belong
[5920.88 → 5921.10] to

[5921.24 → 5921.54] one
[5921.54 → 5922.08] who
[5922.08 → 5922.72] faithfully
[5922.72 → 5922.98] and
[5922.98 → 5923.10] in
[5923.10 → 5923.30] all
[5923.30 → 5923.44] the
[5923.44 → 5923.74] places
[5923.74 → 5923.96] where
[5923.96 → 5924.14] I
[5924.14 → 5924.38] live
[5924.38 → 5925.12] frantically
[5925.12 → 5925.98] he
[5925.98 → 5926.96] lived
[5926.96 → 5928.34] surrendered
[5928.34 → 5931.56] the
[5931.56 → 5931.86] story
[5931.86 → 5932.02] of
[5932.02 → 5932.20] Mary
[5932.20 → 5932.38] and
[5932.38 → 5932.80] Joseph
[5932.80 → 5933.62] the
[5933.62 → 5933.96] gospel
[5933.96 → 5934.22] of
[5934.22 → 5934.54] Jesus
[5934.54 → 5935.52] is
[5935.52 → 5935.74] an
[5935.74 → 5936.58] invitation
[5936.58 → 5937.48] for
[5937.48 → 5937.84] you
[5937.84 → 5938.38] into
[5938.38 → 5938.86] this
[5938.86 → 5939.34] truth
[5939.34 → 5940.28] that
[5940.28 → 5940.62] true
[5940.62 → 5941.06] peace
[5941.06 → 5941.56] comes
[5941.56 → 5941.80] when
[5941.80 → 5942.00] we
[5942.00 → 5942.46] yield
[5942.46 → 5943.40] ourselves
[5943.40 → 5943.74] to
[5943.74 → 5944.22] God's
[5944.22 → 5944.64] will
[5944.64 → 5945.14] even
[5945.14 → 5945.58] when
[5945.58 → 5946.16] especially
[5946.16 → 5946.86] when
[5946.86 → 5947.10] it
[5947.10 → 5947.58] disrupts
[5947.58 → 5947.76] our
[5947.76 → 5948.10] plans
[5948.10 → 5948.40] because
[5948.40 → 5948.64] the
[5948.64 → 5949.32] disruption
[5949.32 → 5950.20] may
[5950.20 → 5950.54] in
[5950.54 → 5950.82] fact
[5950.82 → 5951.04] be
[5951.04 → 5951.26] the
[5951.26 → 5951.54] source
[5951.54 → 5951.84] of
[5951.84 → 5952.26] peace
[5952.26 → 5953.50] peace
[5953.50 → 5953.66] is
[5953.66 → 5953.82] not
[5953.82 → 5954.16] found
[5954.16 → 5954.34] in
[5954.34 → 5954.80] controlling
[5954.80 → 5955.08] our
[5955.08 → 5955.72] circumstances
[5955.72 → 5956.30] or escaping
[5956.30 → 5956.98] responsibilities
[5956.98 → 5957.92] or endlessly
[5957.92 → 5958.52] trying to
[5958.52 → 5958.86] become
[5958.86 → 5959.36] the right
[5959.36 → 5959.78] version
[5959.78 → 5960.08] of
[5960.08 → 5960.58] ourselves
[5960.58 → 5961.32] peace
[5961.32 → 5961.66] is
[5961.66 → 5962.12] found
[5962.12 → 5962.60] in
[5962.60 → 5963.08] union
[5963.08 → 5963.70] with
[5963.70 → 5964.48] Christ
[5964.48 → 5964.72] in
[5964.72 → 5964.90] letting
[5964.90 → 5965.24] his
[5965.24 → 5965.78] obedience
[5965.78 → 5966.08] his
[5966.08 → 5966.46] trust
[5966.46 → 5966.58] and
[5966.58 → 5966.80] his
[5966.80 → 5967.12] willing
[5967.12 → 5967.70] surrender
[5967.70 → 5969.48] become
[5969.48 → 5971.18] the rhythm
[5971.18 → 5972.30] of our
[5972.30 → 5973.04] lives
[5973.04 → 5975.02] this
[5975.02 → 5975.56] advent
[5975.56 → 5976.82] because our
[5976.82 → 5977.22] union
[5977.22 → 5977.58] with
[5977.58 → 5978.04] Christ
[5978.04 → 5978.66] we can
[5978.66 → 5979.60] choose
[5979.60 → 5980.24] to let
[5980.24 → 5980.88] Christ's
[5980.88 → 5981.12] willing
[5981.12 → 5981.70] surrender
[5981.70 → 5982.26] become
[5982.26 → 5982.68] our
[5982.68 → 5983.52] rest
[5983.52 → 5983.60] God
[5983.60 → 5985.70] I want
[5985.70 → 5985.80] to
[5985.80 → 5986.06] end
[5986.06 → 5987.40] with
[5987.40 → 5987.66] three
[5987.66 → 5988.06] ways
[5988.06 → 5988.74] that
[5988.74 → 5988.86] you
[5988.86 → 5989.10] can
[5989.10 → 5990.00] make
[5990.00 → 5990.34] your
[5990.34 → 5990.74] advent
[5990.74 → 5991.04] and
[5991.04 → 5991.44] Christmas
[5991.44 → 5991.86] look
[5991.86 → 5992.48] different
[5992.48 → 5993.18] based
[5993.18 → 5993.36] on
[5993.36 → 5993.58] this
[5993.58 → 5993.86] call
[5993.86 → 5995.60] first
[5995.60 → 5996.16] one
[5996.16 → 5997.56] yield
[5997.56 → 5997.88] your
[5997.88 → 5998.32] calendar
[5998.32 → 6000.56] take
[6000.56 → 6001.00] a moment
[6001.00 → 6001.42] to
[6001.42 → 6001.88] pause
[6001.88 → 6002.24] and to
[6002.24 → 6002.54] ask
[6002.54 → 6003.04] what
[6003.04 → 6003.20] am
[6003.20 → 6003.52] I
[6003.52 → 6004.42] holding
[6004.42 → 6004.88] on
[6004.88 → 6005.12] to
[6005.12 → 6005.44] that
[6005.44 → 6005.58] I
[6005.58 → 6005.74] need
[6005.74 → 6005.94] to
[6005.94 → 6006.12] lay
[6006.12 → 6006.44] before
[6006.44 → 6006.88] Christ
[6006.88 → 6008.68] it
[6008.68 → 6008.80] might
[6008.80 → 6008.92] be
[6008.92 → 6009.20] work
[6009.20 → 6009.42] it
[6009.42 → 6009.54] might
[6009.54 → 6009.66] be
[6009.66 → 6010.00] school
[6010.00 → 6010.14] it
[6010.14 → 6010.26] might
[6010.26 → 6010.40] be
[6010.40 → 6016.40] commitments that keep you restless. Write them down and pray over them as an act of surrender,
[6016.88 → 6023.90] saying, Jesus, you are Lord of this schedule, not me. Now hear very clearly what I said there, right?
[6024.60 → 6030.90] I said write them down, not necessarily lay them down, because there are things you have to do.
[6031.74 → 6036.48] There are things that need to get done, but how you do them and the heart you take into them
[6036.48 → 6043.62] is what we're after here. And so pray them to God. And maybe God will answer your praying by saying,
[6044.18 → 6048.54] not this, not that. Maybe there is something you need to lay down,
[6049.46 → 6057.16] but pray it to God. Give him your calendar. Two, rest in word and in prayer. And here,
[6057.16 → 6063.28] spend intentional time in the word, not to fix your peace, but to receive it.
[6063.28 → 6071.00] Right? Maybe commit this season to a slow reading of the Gospel of Luke,
[6072.00 → 6078.82] right? Time it out so that you finish it over your Christmas break. And then with that,
[6079.04 → 6083.96] change your approach to prayer, right? Prayer is not just asking for relief,
[6083.96 → 6091.92] right? What happens if we change our prayer from, God, remove this from me, to an in prayer,
[6091.92 → 6102.66] receiving Christ's presence where our striving cannot reach. And then lastly, give God your every day.
[6103.94 → 6109.86] Right? Yielding doesn't always mean dramatic changes. It can look like responding patiently
[6109.86 → 6114.42] to a family member. Some of us will be tested in that over the next few weeks.
[6114.42 → 6120.22] It can look like giving a difficult task to God instead of trying to control it yourself.
[6121.22 → 6130.24] It can look like speaking grace when frustration rises. Right? These acts of trust can cultivate peace
[6130.24 → 6141.12] in real time. Advent invites us to live like Mary and Joseph because Jesus has lived for us.
[6141.12 → 6148.42] To say, let it be to me according to your word. To obey and trust even when the future is uncertain.
[6149.26 → 6154.96] And because Jesus has already walked perfectly in our shoes, obeying and surrendering where we fail,
[6155.04 → 6163.52] his peace, right, is not distant or theoretical. It is here. It is now. Furthermore, it is every day. Furthermore, it is in the ordinary.
[6163.52 → 6174.32] And so this is my prayer for you. May the peace of Christ be with you all. In the name of the Father,
[6174.88 → 6180.72] and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Let's pray together.
[6180.72 → 6194.88] Holy God. May we today, a little more deeply, a little more comprehensively,
[6195.50 → 6204.98] grasp this reality of peace. May we today see Jesus just a little bit more clearly
[6204.98 → 6211.52] in why he has come and in what his coming to us brings.
[6216.96 → 6222.28] Lord Jesus, you have promised us that in this world we would have trouble.
[6223.62 → 6230.38] But you have also shown us that you have overcome the world. That you have come into this world to
[6230.38 → 6235.82] bring peace and to give us peace. And so, Lord God,
[6237.58 → 6239.90] convicted, may we confess.
[6241.24 → 6244.78] And confessing, may we receive assurance
[6244.78 → 6248.90] that you are a God who forgives.
[6249.18 → 6252.38] That you are a God who has granted us peace.
[6253.24 → 6255.80] And so may we taste that today.
[6255.80 → 6262.22] And may we go forward living in the peace that only Christ provides.
[6262.92 → 6265.22] In your name we pray. Amen.
[6266.14 → 6266.56] Amen.
[6285.80 → 6291.42] Behold the star, and lift the head.
[6291.42 → 6298.38] The word of God has become flesh.
[6298.38 → 6311.88] Unto us a child is born, the Saviour of this broken world.
[6311.88 → 6318.70] O hear the angel voices.
[6318.70 → 6325.94] Sing, come, let us adore him.
[6325.94 → 6335.80] Peace has come, for our King is with us.
[6335.80 → 6337.80] Peace has come, for our King is with us.
[6337.80 → 6338.80] Peace has come, for our King is with us.
[6338.80 → 6344.80] Holy God, holy man, holy man,
[6344.80 → 6351.24] He comes for all with open hands.
[6351.24 → 6357.86] He rules with love on David's throne.
[6357.86 → 6363.98] The grace he longs to Christ alone.
[6363.98 → 6370.98] O hear the angel voices.
[6370.98 → 6377.98] Say, come, let us adore him.
[6377.98 → 6387.98] Peace has come, for our King is with us.
[6387.98 → 6389.98] Amen.
[6389.98 → 6419.96] Peace has come, for our King is with us.
[6419.96 → 6426.96] Oh, come, let us adore him.
[6426.96 → 6428.96] A, come, let us adore him.
[6428.96 → 6439.96] A, come, let us adore him.
[6439.96 → 6441.96] Oh
[6469.96 → 6471.96] Oh
[6499.96 → 6501.96] Oh

[6505.96 → 6507.96] Oh
[6507.96 → 6509.96] Oh
[6515.96 → 6521.96] As we go into this week, we go as those with whom our good God goes.
[6521.96 → 6529.96] He goes with us. He goes before us and so receive his blessing for the journey of life and faith ahead.
[6531.96 → 6533.96] God go before you to lead you.
[6533.96 → 6536.96] God go behind you to protect you.
[6537.96 → 6542.96] God go beneath you to support you and God go beside you to befriend you.
[6542.96 → 6544.96] Do not be afraid.
[6545.96 → 6547.96] Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[6547.96 → 6554.96] Do not be afraid but go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
[6555.96 → 6556.96] Amen.
[6577.96 → 6587.96] Father of life, draw me closer.
[6587.96 → 6593.96] Lord, my heart is still on you.
[6593.96 → 6597.96] Let me run the race of time.
[6597.96 → 6601.96] Let your heart hold in mind.
[6601.96 → 6607.96] And let the tears of God let it rain.
[6607.96 → 6609.96] Oh
[6609.96 → 6613.96] Oh
[6613.96 → 6619.96] Strengthen me, hold my head up high.
[6619.96 → 6623.96] And I'll stand upon your truth.
[6623.96 → 6625.96] Bringing glory unto you.
[6625.96 → 6631.96] And let me feel so glad that it rain.
[6631.96 → 6633.96] Oh
[6633.96 → 6634.96] Oh
[6634.96 → 6638.96] Lord, I hunger for more of you.

[6768.96 → 6770.96] Can you imagine this for maybe some days?
[6770.96 → 6774.96] No one to do, not no one to let my soul leave.
