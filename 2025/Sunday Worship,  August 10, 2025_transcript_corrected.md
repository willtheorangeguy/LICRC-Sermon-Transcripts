[1242.50 → 1246.82] And do not forget to do good and to share with others,
[1247.12 → 1250.36] for with such sacrifices God is pleased.

[1255.10 → 1256.44] the Lamb upon the throne.
[1257.14 → 1258.88] Like the generations before us,
[1258.88 → 1262.72] let us offer up a sacrifice of praise as we lift his name.

[1586.16 → 1588.16] them all
[1588.16 → 1590.16] all thrones
[1590.16 → 1592.16] and dominions
[1592.16 → 1594.16] all power

[1596.16 → 1598.16] your name
[1598.16 → 1600.16] stands above
[1600.16 → 1602.16] them all

[1606.16 → 1608.16] holy
[1608.16 → 1610.16] you are lifted
[1610.16 → 1612.16] high
[1612.16 → 1614.16] holy
[1614.16 → 1616.16] holy
[1616.16 → 1618.16] forever
[1618.16 → 1620.16] we
[1620.16 → 1622.16] hear people sing
[1622.16 → 1624.16] holy
[1624.16 → 1626.16] to the
[1626.16 → 1628.16] key of
[1628.16 → 1630.16] me
[1630.16 → 1632.16] holy
[1632.16 → 1634.16] you will always be
[1634.16 → 1636.16] holy
[1636.16 → 1638.16] holy
[1638.16 → 1640.16] holy
[1640.16 → 1642.16] forever
[1642.16 → 1644.16] you will always be
[1644.16 → 1646.16] holy
[1646.16 → 1648.16] holy
[1648.16 → 1650.16] forever
[1650.16 → 1652.16] forever
[1656.16 → 1658.16] I invite you to be seated
[1658.16 → 1660.16] we
[1660.16 → 1662.16] we
[1662.16 → 1664.16] started off this
[1664.16 → 1666.16] morning in the end of the call to worship
[1666.16 → 1668.16] reading
[1668.16 → 1670.16] Hebrews 13 verse 16, and it says
[1670.16 → 1674.16] do not forget to do good and to share with others
[1674.16 → 1678.16] for with such sacrifices God is pleased
[1678.16 → 1680.16] I think
[1680.16 → 1682.16] I think for me anyway I can get pretty focused on my own life
[1682.16 → 1684.16] my own needs
[1684.16 → 1688.16] and I sometimes forget the things that please God like he's
[1688.16 → 1692.16] saying here that this kind of sacrifices please him
[1692.16 → 1694.16] and
[1694.16 → 1698.16] and to do good and to share with others it just sounds so simple but
[1698.16 → 1716.16] it can be hard to make that a lifestyle I can do it for a season but to make that a lifestyle is something that only I think the spirit of God living in your heart and renewing you daily helps your kind of keep that in your mind and in your heart, and so I just want to offer a prayer this with power heads
[1716.16 → 1728.16] father
[1728.16 → 1734.16] will you continue to renew our hearts
[1734.16 → 1738.16] and teach us to trust you
[1738.16 → 1744.16] will you place your love in our hearts and help us to build our lives on your love
[1744.16 → 1746.16] forgive us
[1746.16 → 1748.16] forgive us when we miss your promptings
[1748.16 → 1752.16] when we choose our comforts over helping others
[1752.16 → 1756.16] and lord may you Jesus
[1756.16 → 1758.16] be the centre of our hearts and in our lives
[1758.16 → 1760.16] and we ask this in your name
[1760.16 → 1762.16] amen
[1764.16 → 1766.16] rise and join us again
[1766.16 → 1768.16] in
[1768.16 → 1778.16] we
[1778.16 → 1780.16] we
[1780.16 → 1782.16] we
[1782.16 → 1784.16] we
[1784.16 → 1786.16] we
[1786.16 → 1788.16] we
[1788.16 → 1790.16] we
[1790.16 → 1792.16] we

[1794.16 → 1796.16] we
[1796.16 → 1808.16] we

[1846.16 → 1848.16] we
[1848.16 → 1850.16] we
[1850.16 → 1852.98] around me.
[1866.54 → 1870.80] Jesus, the name above every other name.
[1872.78 → 1877.40] Jesus, the only one who could ever sing.
[1877.40 → 1883.50] We will heal every breath, we could ever breathe.
[1883.62 → 1885.32] We live for you.
[1886.50 → 1888.44] We live for you.
[1890.70 → 1895.12] Holy, there is no one like you.
[1895.32 → 1898.26] There is none beside you.
[1898.66 → 1902.54] Open up my eyes in wonder.
[1902.54 → 1909.02] Show me who you are and fill me with your heart.
[1909.26 → 1915.36] And lead me in love to those around me.
[1915.36 → 1922.36] I will build my life upon your love.
[1922.36 → 1929.36] I will build my life upon your love.
[1929.36 → 1945.58] I will build my life upon your love.
[1945.58 → 1950.44] It is a firm foundation.
[1950.44 → 1957.48] I will build my life upon your love.
[1957.48 → 1962.30] And I will not be shaken.
[1962.30 → 1969.28] And I will build my life upon your love.
[1969.28 → 1974.16] It is a firm foundation.
[1974.82 → 1981.28] I will build my life upon your love.
[1981.28 → 1986.18] And I will not be shaken.
[1986.18 → 1991.26] Holy, there is no one like you.
[1991.26 → 1994.52] There is none beside you.
[1995.00 → 1998.80] Open up my eyes in wonder.
[1999.18 → 2005.16] And show me who you are and fill me with your heart.
[2005.16 → 2008.10] And leave me with your heart.
[2008.36 → 2009.22] If you know who you are,
[2009.22 → 2011.46] around me.
[2025.92 → 2027.94] Amen.
[2027.94 → 2057.92] piano plays softly
[2057.92 → 2087.90] piano plays softly
[2087.92 → 2117.90] piano plays softly
[2117.90 → 2119.90] piano plays softly
[2119.90 → 2122.94] With all creation I sing
[2122.94 → 2125.90] Praise to you, King of kings
[2125.90 → 2127.90] You are my everything
[2128.46 → 2131.90] And I will adore you
[2131.90 → 2149.90] Clothed in rainbows of living colour
[2149.90 → 2153.90] Flashes of lightning, rolls of thunder
[2153.90 → 2159.90] Blessing and honour, strength and glory
[2159.90 → 2167.90] Empower me to you, the only wise king
[2167.90 → 2171.90] Holy, holy, holy
[2171.90 → 2173.90] Is the Lord God Almighty
[2173.90 → 2177.90] Who was and is and is to come
[2177.90 → 2183.90] With all creation I sing
[2183.90 → 2185.90] Praise to the King of peace

[2188.90 → 2193.90] And I will adore you
[2193.90 → 2206.90] Filled with wonder
[2206.90 → 2210.90] Awestruck wonder
[2210.90 → 2216.90] At the mention of your name
[2216.90 → 2219.90] Filled with wonder
[2219.90 → 2222.90] Awestruck wonder
[2222.90 → 2228.90] At the mention of your name
[2228.90 → 2232.90] Jesus, your name is power
[2232.90 → 2234.90] Breath of the Lord
[2234.90 → 2236.90] Breath of the Lord
[2236.90 → 2238.90] Such a marvellous mystery
[2238.90 → 2244.90] Holy, holy, holy
[2244.90 → 2246.90] Holy, holy
[2246.90 → 2248.90] Is the Lord God Almighty
[2248.90 → 2252.90] Who was and is and is to come
[2252.90 → 2254.90] With all creation I sing
[2254.90 → 2256.90] With all creation I sing
[2256.90 → 2258.90] Praise to the King of kings
[2258.90 → 2260.90] You are my everything
[2260.90 → 2264.90] And I will adore you
[2264.90 → 2266.90] Holy, holy, holy
[2266.90 → 2270.90] Is the Lord God Almighty
[2270.90 → 2274.90] Who was and is and is to come
[2274.90 → 2280.90] With all creation I sing
[2280.90 → 2282.90] Praise to the King of kings
[2282.90 → 2284.90] You are my everything
[2284.90 → 2288.90] And I will adore you
[2288.90 → 2306.90] May we see you
[2306.90 → 2322.90] Good morning my name is Pearl
[2322.90 → 2324.90] I'm one of the deacons here
[2324.90 → 2326.90] At Langley Emanuel, and we continue worship
[2326.90 → 2328.90] By having an offering and our offering
[2328.90 → 2330.90] Today is for the budget
[2330.90 → 2332.90] Which is for the ministries of this church
[2332.90 → 2334.90] And if you wish to give to that then please
[2334.90 → 2336.90] Mark it as such you can use the envelopes
[2336.90 → 2338.90] That are in the chairs in front of you
[2338.90 → 2340.90] And then any other offerings
[2340.90 → 2342.90] That are not marked are going to be going
[2342.90 → 2348.90] To the CRC BC Refugee Chaplain Ministry
[2348.90 → 2354.90] And this ministry is currently run by Dina Nikolai
[2354.90 → 2358.90] And she works out of the Welcome Centre in Vancouver
[2358.90 → 2362.90] And her mission is to provide a welcoming face
[2362.90 → 2366.90] To all immigrants and visitors that are
[2366.90 → 2370.90] Come to Canada that are seeking a place to live here
[2370.90 → 2374.90] And so she provides support in the way of pointing them
[2374.90 → 2376.90] Into housing, pointing them to
[2376.90 → 2378.90] Pointing them to English language
[2378.90 → 2382.90] What all these things that refugees need
[2382.90 → 2384.90] So it's a very important ministry that's happening
[2384.90 → 2386.90] In downtown Vancouver
[2386.90 → 2388.90] Very interesting
[2388.90 → 2390.90] The verse that I picked
[2390.90 → 2392.90] To kind of sort of wrap this up
[2392.90 → 2394.90] Is the same verse
[2394.90 → 2396.90] Do not forget to do good
[2396.90 → 2398.90] And share with others
[2398.90 → 2400.90] For with such sacrifices God is pleased
[2400.90 → 2402.90] So now you've heard it three times
[2402.90 → 2404.90] Thank you
[2432.90 → 2438.90] For the gift of grace is my Redeemer
[2438.90 → 2444.90] There is no more for heaven now to give
[2444.90 → 2450.90] He is my joy, my righteousness and freedom
[2450.90 → 2456.90] My steadfast love, my deep and balanced peace
[2456.90 → 2458.90] To this I hold
[2458.90 → 2462.90] My hope is only Jesus
[2462.90 → 2468.90] For my life is holy, and who is
[2468.90 → 2472.90] Oh how strange and divine
[2472.90 → 2475.90] I can see all is mine
[2475.90 → 2480.90] Yet not I, but through Christ in me
[2480.90 → 2486.90] The night is dark
[2486.90 → 2490.90] But I am not forsaken
[2490.90 → 2492.90] For by my side
[2492.90 → 2496.90] My Saviour he will stay
[2496.90 → 2498.90] I labour on
[2498.90 → 2502.90] In weakness and rejoicing
[2502.90 → 2504.90] For in my need
[2504.90 → 2508.90] His power is displayed
[2508.90 → 2510.90] His power is filled
[2510.90 → 2512.90] My shepherd will defend me
[2512.90 → 2516.90] Through the deepest valleys
[2516.90 → 2518.90] He will lead
[2518.90 → 2522.90] Oh the night has been won
[2522.90 → 2524.90] And I shall overcome
[2524.90 → 2528.90] Yet not I, but through Christ in me
[2528.90 → 2540.90] Christ in me
[2540.90 → 2542.90] No fate I dread
[2542.90 → 2546.90] I know I am forgiven
[2546.90 → 2548.90] The future sure
[2548.90 → 2552.90] The price it has been paid
[2552.90 → 2554.90] For Jesus bled
[2554.90 → 2556.90] And suffered for my pardon
[2556.90 → 2560.90] And He was raised
[2560.90 → 2562.90] To overflow the grave
[2562.90 → 2566.90] To this I hold
[2566.90 → 2568.90] My sin has been defeated
[2568.90 → 2572.90] Jesus now and ever is my King
[2572.90 → 2574.90] Now and ever is my King
[2574.90 → 2576.90] Now and ever is my King
[2576.90 → 2578.90] Hold a chain down in least
[2578.90 → 2580.90] I can sing
[2580.90 → 2582.90] I am free
[2582.90 → 2586.90] And not I, but through Christ in me
[2586.90 → 2598.90] With every breath
[2598.90 → 2600.90] I long to follow Jesus
[2600.90 → 2604.90] For He has said
[2604.90 → 2608.90] That He will bring me home
[2608.90 → 2610.90] And day by day
[2610.90 → 2614.90] I know He will renew me
[2614.90 → 2616.90] Until I stand
[2616.90 → 2620.90] With joy before the door
[2620.90 → 2622.90] To this I hold
[2622.90 → 2626.90] My hope is only Jesus
[2626.90 → 2632.90] All but glory evermore to Him
[2632.90 → 2634.90] When the race is complete
[2634.90 → 2638.90] Still my lips shall repeat
[2638.90 → 2644.90] And not I, but through Christ in me
[2644.90 → 2646.90] To this I hold
[2646.90 → 2650.90] My hope is only Jesus
[2650.90 → 2656.90] All but glory evermore to Him
[2656.90 → 2658.90] When the race is complete
[2658.90 → 2662.90] Still my lips shall repeat
[2662.90 → 2668.90] Yet not I, but through Christ in me
[2668.90 → 2672.90] When the race is complete
[2672.90 → 2674.90] Still my lips shall repeat
[2674.90 → 2680.90] Yet not I, but through Christ in me
[2680.90 → 2686.90] Yet not I, but through Christ in me
[2700.90 → 2704.90] I would love to invite any kids age 3
[2704.90 → 2706.90] to kindergarten or older if you want
[2706.90 → 2708.90] You can come up here
[2708.90 → 2712.90] And join me for the children's blessing
[2715.90 → 2718.90] Alright, here comes some
[2718.90 → 2720.90] Look at us today
[2723.90 → 2724.90] Good morning everyone
[2727.90 → 2729.90] Good morning everyone
[2729.90 → 2730.90] Good morning
[2730.90 → 2731.90] Good morning
[2731.90 → 2732.90] How's your summer been?
[2732.90 → 2734.90] Are you playing outside a lot?
[2734.90 → 2735.90] Yeah
[2735.90 → 2737.90] I was playing inside
[2737.90 → 2738.90] Not very much
[2738.90 → 2739.90] No, not very much
[2739.90 → 2740.90] Yeah, inside not very much
[2740.90 → 2741.90] Outside a lot?
[2742.90 → 2743.90] No?
[2744.90 → 2745.90] Well
[2745.90 → 2748.90] Good, lots of running is good
[2748.90 → 2750.90] We're going to go to children's worship time
[2750.90 → 2752.90] But before we go, can I pray?
[2752.90 → 2753.90] And then we're going to do the children's blessing
[2754.90 → 2756.90] But we're going to have to be extra loud today I think
[2756.90 → 2757.90] Are we ready for that?
[2757.90 → 2758.90] Let's pray first, okay?
[2758.90 → 2759.90] Alright, let's pray
[2759.90 → 2761.90] Dear God, thank you so much for this day
[2761.90 → 2763.90] Thank you that we could come to church this morning
[2763.90 → 2765.90] That we could learn more about you
[2765.90 → 2767.90] Be with us as we go to children's worship time
[2767.90 → 2769.90] And the grown-ups as we stay back here
[2769.90 → 2772.90] And as we all learn what it means to follow you in this world
[2772.90 → 2774.90] We pray this in your name
[2774.90 → 2775.90] Amen
[2775.90 → 2776.90] Amen
[2776.90 → 2777.90] Okay, let's stand up
[2777.90 → 2778.90] Everybody else is going to stand up too?
[2778.90 → 2780.90] There's only four of you
[2780.90 → 2781.90] Five of you
[2781.90 → 2782.90] So we're going to have to say
[2782.90 → 2784.90] The Lord be with you
[2784.90 → 2786.90] Really loudly, okay?
[2786.90 → 2787.90] Can we do that really loud?
[2787.90 → 2788.90] On the count of three
[2788.90 → 2789.90] On the count of three
[2789.90 → 2790.90] Are you ready?
[2790.90 → 2791.90] One
[2791.90 → 2792.90] Two
[2792.90 → 2793.90] Three
[2793.90 → 2795.90] The Lord be with you
[2795.90 → 2797.90] And also with you
[2797.90 → 2798.90] Good job
[2798.90 → 2800.90] Have fun in children's worship time
[2818.90 → 2839.90] How about now?
[2839.90 → 2840.90] There you go
[2840.90 → 2843.90] Some of my favourite sounds in church
[2843.90 → 2845.90] Are the noises of children
[2845.90 → 2847.90] Not Kevin
[2852.90 → 2856.90] It's my privilege to lead in our church family prayer this morning
[2856.90 → 2860.90] I'm going to do that shaped by the words of Psalm 86
[2860.90 → 2864.90] And so you'll hear some of those throughout our prayer
[2864.90 → 2869.90] And then some of what I pray is also made note of in the e-bulletin
[2869.90 → 2872.90] That many of you have received already
[2873.90 → 2876.90] And if you have not received the e-bulletin
[2876.90 → 2878.90] Or don't receive that every week and would like to
[2878.90 → 2880.90] Please just send a note to the church office
[2880.90 → 2882.90] You can talk to me after on how to do that
[2882.90 → 2884.90] And I'd love to get you set up in that way
[2885.90 → 2887.90] Let's come to God in prayer together
[2887.90 → 2894.90] Hear me, Lord, and answer me
[2894.90 → 2899.90] For I am poor and needy
[2900.90 → 2904.90] Hear my prayer, Lord, and listen to my cry for mercy
[2904.90 → 2908.90] When I am in distress, I call out to you
[2908.90 → 2915.90] Hear the prayers, God, of your saints who gather in this place
[2915.90 → 2922.90] Some of us are here this morning out of habit and ritual
[2922.90 → 2924.90] And that's great
[2925.90 → 2929.90] Some of us are here this morning because we have reason to celebrate
[2929.90 → 2930.90] And joy to give
[2930.90 → 2934.90] And we want to lay that at the throne of your majesty and power
[2934.90 → 2936.90] And that is great
[2937.90 → 2942.90] And some of us are here this morning because we are crying out for help
[2942.90 → 2949.90] In our life and circumstances, it seems as if we have nowhere else to go
[2950.90 → 2953.90] For some of us, this is the last resort
[2956.90 → 2958.90] And that's great that we're here
[2959.90 → 2962.90] Hear our cry for mercy
[2963.90 → 2965.90] And Lord, listen to our plea
[2965.90 → 2966.90] For you are great
[2966.90 → 2968.90] And do marvellous deeds
[2968.90 → 2971.90] For you alone are God
[2972.90 → 2976.90] Because of who you are, Lord, we join our voice with the psalmist who says
[2976.90 → 2980.90] I will praise you, Lord, my God, with all my heart
[2980.90 → 2984.90] I will glorify your name forever
[2984.90 → 2987.90] I will glorify your name forever
[2989.90 → 2994.90] We have so many reasons to give thanks and praise to who you are
[2994.90 → 2996.90] And for what you have done
[2997.90 → 2999.90] We marvel at the majesty of your name
[2999.90 → 3002.90] We marvel at the truth of your being
[3003.90 → 3004.90] And we are amazed
[3005.90 → 3010.90] Even as our eyes catch only a small glimpse of your power
[3010.90 → 3014.90] But when we see that, Lord God
[3015.90 → 3017.90] May our hearts be stilled
[3018.90 → 3021.90] May our lips be full of praise
[3022.90 → 3025.90] And may we present ourselves to you
[3026.90 → 3028.90] Holy and pleasing sacrifice
[3029.90 → 3034.90] God, this week we give you thanks for celebrations
[3034.90 → 3037.90] For celebrations, for particularly wedding celebrations
[3038.90 → 3041.90] We celebrate with Ava and Jared
[3042.90 → 3043.90] Their marriage on Friday
[3044.90 → 3045.90] And with Kaylee and Willem
[3046.90 → 3047.90] Their marriage on Saturday
[3048.90 → 3050.90] What a beautiful testimony of your faithfulness
[3051.90 → 3052.90] And a beautiful testament
[3053.90 → 3057.90] Of you raising up a new generation of believers
[3058.90 → 3061.90] A young generation of people committed to you
[3061.90 → 3064.90] To walk in life and faith together
[3065.90 → 3067.90] We thank you for that incredible celebration
[3068.90 → 3071.90] And that time to be present with them
[3072.90 → 3073.90] In the midst of their joy
[3074.90 → 3077.90] We pray that you would bless their marriage
[3078.90 → 3083.90] That you would cause them to find in that
[3084.90 → 3086.90] The foundation of Christ alone
[3086.90 → 3089.90] And that they might build their life together
[3090.90 → 3092.90] In faithful obedience to your word
[3093.90 → 3096.90] As they discern where it is that you are calling them to go
[3097.90 → 3100.90] And how it is that you are calling them to get there
[3101.90 → 3104.90] Father God, we praise your name
[3104.90 → 3105.90] Amen
[3111.90 → 3113.90] But even as we praise
[3114.90 → 3116.90] We offer you our distress
[3117.90 → 3125.90] Even as we sing songs of hope and joy
[3126.90 → 3132.90] We know that life often feels as though arrogant foes are attacking us, O God
[3132.90 → 3139.90] That ruthless people, circumstances, powers, and principalities are trying to kill us
[3140.90 → 3141.90] And they have no regard for you
[3142.90 → 3146.90] Save us in the midst of this
[3147.90 → 3151.90] Help us in our grieving
[3152.90 → 3156.90] As we have joined with the Tessa Maker and Hogawoning families
[3156.90 → 3159.90] In their grief, the passing of Tanya
[3159.90 → 3163.90] As we have celebrated her life together this past week as well
[3164.90 → 3167.90] We pray for your hand of blessing on them
[3168.90 → 3171.90] Going forward into the next days and weeks and months
[3172.90 → 3175.90] That they might draw hope and courage from you
[3176.90 → 3179.90] But also that they might lay their hearts bare before you
[3180.90 → 3182.90] In the hurt and in the pain
[3182.90 → 3186.90] Father God, we join also with Gary this morning
[3187.90 → 3190.90] As he is mourning the sudden and unexpected loss of a friend
[3191.90 → 3192.90] Be near to him
[3193.90 → 3194.90] In this time
[3195.90 → 3197.90] As he searches for answers
[3198.90 → 3202.90] And for ways to walk through this valley of the shadow of death
[3203.90 → 3204.90] We pray that you would draw near to him
[3205.90 → 3207.90] And that you would help him
[3207.90 → 3208.90] Father God, we pray that
[3208.90 → 3210.90] Father God, we pray that
[3210.90 → 3212.90] Father God, we pray that
[3213.90 → 3215.90] In this time you would
[3216.90 → 3218.90] Teach me your way, O Lord
[3219.90 → 3220.90] That I may rely on your faithfulness
[3221.90 → 3222.90] Give me an undivided heart
[3223.90 → 3225.90] That I may fear your name
[3226.90 → 3228.90] So we pray, God, that you would
[3229.90 → 3233.90] Draw those who are walking hard roads to you
[3233.90 → 3238.90] Help us on this hard journey to focus on you
[3239.90 → 3242.90] We continue to pray for Doug
[3243.90 → 3244.90] Asking that you would be near to him
[3245.90 → 3246.90] As he struggles with cancer
[3247.90 → 3249.90] We continue to pray, God, for our brothers and sisters
[3250.90 → 3253.90] Our family and friends who are walking a not dissimilar journey
[3253.90 → 3257.90] We thank you for news like that of Clary's sister
[3258.90 → 3260.90] Who has journeyed this road
[3261.90 → 3263.90] And at this point seems to be responding well
[3264.90 → 3267.90] And we pray that you would stir hope in those
[3268.90 → 3270.90] For whom that news has not yet come
[3271.90 → 3274.90] In this time, O God
[3275.90 → 3279.90] May we confess that you are my God
[3279.90 → 3281.90] We cry out to you saying
[3282.90 → 3283.90] Have mercy on me, O Lord
[3284.90 → 3287.90] And in that crying, may we hear the psalmist say
[3288.90 → 3291.90] But you, Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God
[3292.90 → 3295.90] Slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness
[3296.90 → 3297.90] Turn to me
[3298.90 → 3299.90] Have mercy on me
[3300.90 → 3302.90] Show your strength in behalf of your servant
[3303.90 → 3307.90] And so strengthen our lives of faith, we pray
[3307.90 → 3308.90] We pray
[3309.90 → 3312.90] We give you thanks, God, for new babies
[3313.90 → 3316.90] And pray that you would grow them strong and healthy
[3317.90 → 3319.90] We give you thanks for new parents
[3320.90 → 3322.90] Whether it's the first-time new parents
[3323.90 → 3324.90] Or the third-time parent
[3325.90 → 3328.90] We pray for strength for them as well
[3329.90 → 3331.90] God, in these summer months we pray as well
[3332.90 → 3333.90] For pregnant women
[3333.90 → 3338.90] Who are feeling in extra measure the heat and the warmth
[3339.90 → 3342.90] And who are anticipating the birth of their child
[3343.90 → 3346.90] Father God, we pray as well
[3347.90 → 3349.90] For those who are struggling to become pregnant
[3350.90 → 3353.90] We pray for those who long to be parents
[3354.90 → 3355.90] And yet, for one reason or another
[3356.90 → 3358.90] Have not yet had that longing satisfied
[3358.90 → 3362.90] And so be near to them as well
[3363.90 → 3367.90] And God, we pray for the unique family situations
[3368.90 → 3370.90] That we know about and have in our midst
[3371.90 → 3374.90] We pray for those who are transitioning into new care
[3375.90 → 3376.90] And those who are looking for care
[3376.90 → 3378.90] God, you are good
[3379.90 → 3382.90] And we trust in your goodness to us
[3383.90 → 3385.90] Draw us to yourself
[3386.90 → 3390.90] God, as we come now to your word
[3391.90 → 3393.90] We pray that you would, in spirit power
[3394.90 → 3395.90] Descend on Kevin
[3396.90 → 3397.90] That he might bring it to us boldly
[3398.90 → 3400.90] And so we pray with the psalmist
[3401.90 → 3402.90] In this time, through your word
[3402.90 → 3404.90] Give me a sign of your goodness
[3405.90 → 3406.90] That my enemies may see it
[3407.90 → 3408.90] And be put to shame
[3409.90 → 3410.90] For you, Lord, have helped me
[3411.90 → 3412.90] And comforted me
[3413.90 → 3414.90] God, by your word today
[3415.90 → 3416.90] Help us
[3417.90 → 3418.90] And comfort us
[3419.90 → 3420.90] By your word today
[3421.90 → 3422.90] Discomfort our apathy
[3423.90 → 3425.90] And sustain our faith
[3426.90 → 3429.90] We pray this, Jesus, in your most holy name
[3429.90 → 3430.90] Amen
[3446.90 → 3447.90] I turned mine on, Dave
[3448.90 → 3449.90] So, we're good
[3453.90 → 3454.90] Good morning, everyone
[3455.90 → 3456.90] Kids
[3457.90 → 3458.90] If you're still in here
[3458.90 → 3459.90] I know there's some of you in here
[3459.90 → 3460.90] I've got a story that I want to tell
[3460.90 → 3462.90] Which I hope gives a little bit of an example
[3463.90 → 3464.90] Of what we're going to talk about today
[3465.90 → 3466.90] It's a true story
[3466.90 → 3467.90] I've changed the names
[3468.90 → 3469.90] There was once this elementary student
[3470.90 → 3471.90] Elementary school student
[3471.90 → 3472.90] Let's call him Ethan
[3473.90 → 3474.90] Ethan had a little bit of a reputation
[3475.90 → 3476.90] He was a sharp kid
[3477.90 → 3478.90] He always had the right answer
[3478.90 → 3479.90] He knew how to win an argument
[3480.90 → 3481.90] He was confident in that
[3481.90 → 3483.90] Like I always read the instruction manuals kind of way
[3484.90 → 3486.90] Anyway, one day during recess
[3486.90 → 3487.90] Or free time
[3487.90 → 3488.90] Or something like that
[3488.90 → 3490.90] Ethan got into a bit of a heated discussion
[3491.90 → 3492.90] With a friend of his
[3492.90 → 3493.90] Let's call him Tommy
[3494.90 → 3496.90] This discussion was about Pokémon cards
[3497.90 → 3498.90] Who here knows about Pokémon cards?
[3499.90 → 3500.90] Yeah? Kids?
[3500.90 → 3501.90] Hands up? Adults?
[3502.90 → 3503.90] Any of you too?
[3504.90 → 3505.90] Yeah? Oh, a lot of hands went up
[3505.90 → 3507.90] I don't know much, so forgive me if this story doesn't make sense
[3507.90 → 3509.90] I'm remembering it as best as I could
[3509.90 → 3511.90] I know they're about these like monsters
[3511.90 → 3513.90] And some of them are like fire breathing
[3513.90 → 3514.90] And some live in trees
[3514.90 → 3516.90] And some of them are like psychic turtles
[3516.90 → 3517.90] And I don't know
[3517.90 → 3518.90] But anyway, these two kids
[3518.90 → 3519.90] Ethan and Tommy
[3519.90 → 3520.90] They were fighting over them
[3521.90 → 3524.90] Ethan was saying that Charizard V-Max
[3525.90 → 3528.90] Which I gather is a big orange fire breathing lizard of sorts
[3529.90 → 3530.90] He is unbeatable
[3531.90 → 3533.90] Tommy, however, pointed out that
[3533.90 → 3536.90] That no, actually Kyogre X could wipe it out
[3536.90 → 3538.90] He's some sort of fish, I think
[3539.90 → 3541.90] Anyway, I don't recall what was going on
[3542.90 → 3545.90] I just remember there were dragons and winged fish being talked about
[3545.90 → 3547.90] And both boys were not backing down
[3548.90 → 3549.90] Alright? Not only that actually
[3549.90 → 3551.90] As the conversation got more and more heated
[3552.90 → 3553.90] Tommy actually started to make
[3554.90 → 3555.90] Or sorry, Ethan started to make fun of Tommy
[3556.90 → 3558.90] He started to mock him pretty good actually
[3558.90 → 3559.90] It wasn't very cool
[3560.90 → 3561.90] Now here's the twist
[3561.90 → 3562.90] Later that day
[3563.90 → 3565.90] Ethan realized that Tommy was actually right
[3566.90 → 3569.90] Based on like type advantages or retreat costs
[3570.90 → 3571.90] Again, no idea what that means
[3571.90 → 3573.90] But it turned out that Ethan was wrong
[3574.90 → 3575.90] Tommy was right
[3575.90 → 3576.90] The giant winged orca thing
[3576.90 → 3578.90] Could beat the orange fire breathing lizard thing
[3581.90 → 3582.90] Ethan was embarrassed
[3582.90 → 3583.90] Like really embarrassed
[3583.90 → 3585.90] But instead of pretending like it didn't just happen
[3586.90 → 3588.90] Ethan did something actually pretty cool
[3588.90 → 3590.90] After lunch, before the teacher started up class again
[3591.90 → 3592.90] Ethan actually stood up on his chair
[3593.90 → 3594.90] And announced to the class
[3595.90 → 3596.90] He said, I thought I was right
[3597.90 → 3598.90] But I was wrong
[3598.90 → 3599.90] Tommy was
[3600.90 → 3601.90] I'm sorry for being rude, Tommy
[3602.90 → 3603.90] Tommy just kind of nodded
[3604.90 → 3605.90] Nobody really made a big deal
[3606.90 → 3607.90] And the class moved on
[3608.90 → 3609.90] Now I don't know what a Mew two is
[3610.90 → 3611.90] Or what Snorlax does
[3611.90 → 3613.90] But I do know that what Ethan did there
[3613.90 → 3615.90] Showed a lot of strength that day
[3615.90 → 3617.90] Because humility can be hard
[3618.90 → 3619.90] Right?
[3619.90 → 3620.90] Now that's a simple story
[3621.90 → 3622.90] That happened
[3622.90 → 3623.90] But the truths of that story
[3623.90 → 3624.90] The truths of humbling ourselves
[3625.90 → 3626.90] The truths of forgiveness
[3626.90 → 3627.90] They're going to be highlighted today
[3627.90 → 3628.90] In our text
[3629.90 → 3630.90] Humility and forgiveness
[3630.90 → 3632.90] They're both so important in God's kingdom
[3633.90 → 3635.90] So we're going to look at Matthew chapter 18 today
[3635.90 → 3636.90] And we're going to do something
[3637.90 → 3638.90] We're going to split it up a little bit
[3638.90 → 3640.90] We're going to read the first five verses
[3640.90 → 3641.90] Of Matthew 18
[3641.90 → 3642.90] And then skip a little bit
[3642.90 → 3643.90] And read a parable found
[3644.90 → 3645.90] At verse 21
[3645.90 → 3646.90] So we're going to read
[3646.90 → 3647.90] 1 to 5
[3647.90 → 3648.90] And then 21 to 35 together
[3649.90 → 3650.90] Alright?
[3650.90 → 3651.90] As always I encourage you
[3651.90 → 3652.90] Please have your Bibles open
[3652.90 → 3653.90] You can use your apps as well
[3654.90 → 3655.90] Follow along
[3655.90 → 3656.90] Have those at the ready
[3656.90 → 3657.90] So we can reference them as we go
[3658.90 → 3660.90] Matthew 18, 1 to 5
[3660.90 → 3661.90] And then 21 to 35
[3661.90 → 3662.90] Say this
[3663.90 → 3664.90] At that time
[3664.90 → 3665.90] The disciples came to Jesus
[3665.90 → 3666.90] And asked
[3666.90 → 3667.90] Who then is the greatest
[3667.90 → 3669.90] In the kingdom of heaven
[3670.90 → 3671.90] He, Jesus
[3671.90 → 3672.90] Called a little child to him
[3672.90 → 3673.90] And placed the child among them
[3673.90 → 3674.90] And he said
[3674.90 → 3675.90] Truly I tell you
[3676.90 → 3677.90] Unless you change
[3677.90 → 3678.90] And become like little children
[3679.90 → 3680.90] You will never enter
[3681.90 → 3682.90] The kingdom of heaven
[3682.90 → 3683.90] Therefore, oh
[3683.90 → 3684.90] Whoever takes
[3684.90 → 3685.90] The lowly position of this child
[3686.90 → 3687.90] Is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
[3688.90 → 3689.90] And whoever welcomes
[3690.90 → 3691.90] One such child in my name
[3692.90 → 3693.90] Welcomes me
[3694.90 → 3696.90] I'll skip ahead to verse 21 now
[3696.90 → 3698.90] Then Peter came up to Jesus
[3698.90 → 3699.90] And asked
[3699.90 → 3700.90] Lord, how many times
[3700.90 → 3701.90] Shall I forgive my brother
[3701.90 → 3702.90] Or sister
[3702.90 → 3703.90] Who sins against me?
[3703.90 → 3705.90] Up to seven times?
[3706.90 → 3707.90] Jesus answered
[3707.90 → 3708.90] I tell you
[3708.90 → 3709.90] Not seven times
[3709.90 → 3710.90] But seventy-seven times
[3710.90 → 3711.90] Therefore the kingdom of heaven
[3711.90 → 3712.90] Is like a king
[3713.90 → 3714.90] Who wanted to settle
[3714.90 → 3715.90] Accounts with his servants
[3716.90 → 3717.90] He began the settlement
[3718.90 → 3719.90] A man who owed him
[3719.90 → 3720.90] Ten thousand bags of gold
[3720.90 → 3721.90] Or talents
[3721.90 → 3722.90] As some translations say
[3722.90 → 3723.90] Was brought to him
[3723.90 → 3725.90] Since he was not able to pay
[3725.90 → 3726.90] The master ordered
[3726.90 → 3727.90] That he and his wife
[3727.90 → 3728.90] And his children
[3728.90 → 3729.90] And all that he had
[3729.90 → 3730.90] Be sold
[3730.90 → 3731.90] To repay the debt
[3732.90 → 3733.90] Let this
[3733.90 → 3734.90] The servant fell on his knees
[3734.90 → 3735.90] Before him
[3735.90 → 3736.90] Be patient with me
[3736.90 → 3737.90] He begged
[3737.90 → 3738.90] And I will pay back everything
[3739.90 → 3740.90] The servant's master
[3740.90 → 3741.90] Took pity on him
[3741.90 → 3742.90] Cancelled the debt
[3742.90 → 3743.90] And let him go
[3744.90 → 3745.90] But when that servant went out
[3745.90 → 3747.90] He found one of his fellow servants
[3747.90 → 3749.90] Who owed him a hundred silver coins
[3749.90 → 3750.90] He grabbed him
[3750.90 → 3751.90] And began to choke him
[3751.90 → 3752.90] Pay back what you owe me
[3752.90 → 3753.90] He demanded
[3753.90 → 3754.90] His fellow servant
[3754.90 → 3755.90] Fell to his knees
[3755.90 → 3756.90] And begged him
[3756.90 → 3757.90] Be patient with me
[3757.90 → 3759.90] And I will pay it back
[3760.90 → 3761.90] But he refused
[3762.90 → 3763.90] Instead he went off
[3763.90 → 3764.90] And had the man
[3764.90 → 3765.90] Thrown into prison
[3765.90 → 3766.90] Until he could pay the debt
[3767.90 → 3768.90] When the other servants
[3768.90 → 3769.90] Saw what had happened
[3769.90 → 3770.90] They were outraged
[3770.90 → 3771.90] And went and told their master
[3771.90 → 3772.90] Everything that had happened
[3772.90 → 3774.90] The master called the servant in
[3774.90 → 3776.90] You wicked servant
[3776.90 → 3777.90] He said
[3777.90 → 3779.90] I cancelled all that debt of yours
[3779.90 → 3780.90] Because you begged me
[3780.90 → 3781.90] Shouldn't you
[3781.90 → 3782.90] Have had mercy
[3782.90 → 3783.90] On your fellow servant
[3783.90 → 3785.90] Just as I had on you
[3785.90 → 3786.90] In anger
[3786.90 → 3787.90] His master
[3787.90 → 3788.90] Handed him over to the jailers
[3788.90 → 3789.90] To be tortured
[3789.90 → 3790.90] Until he should pay back
[3790.90 → 3791.90] All he owed
[3791.90 → 3793.90] This is how my heavenly father
[3793.90 → 3794.90] Will treat each of you
[3794.90 → 3796.90] Unless you forgive your brother
[3796.90 → 3797.90] Or sister
[3797.90 → 3798.90] From your heart
[3799.90 → 3800.90] The word of the Lord
[3802.90 → 3803.90] One chapter
[3803.90 → 3804.90] Two sections
[3804.90 → 3805.90] Two questions
[3805.90 → 3806.90] Two answers
[3806.90 → 3808.90] That's our text today
[3808.90 → 3809.90] And in these two stories
[3809.90 → 3811.90] In these two answers
[3811.90 → 3812.90] We are given a picture
[3812.90 → 3814.90] Of what life is like
[3814.90 → 3816.90] In the kingdom of God
[3817.90 → 3819.90] Jesus gives us that picture
[3819.90 → 3821.90] We behold our king
[3821.90 → 3823.90] Who describes the kingdom
[3823.90 → 3825.90] His kingdom
[3826.90 → 3828.90] And so the big idea today
[3828.90 → 3831.90] Is the answers that Jesus gave his disciples
[3831.90 → 3833.90] Life in Jesus' kingdom
[3833.90 → 3834.90] The kingdom
[3834.90 → 3835.90] Is marked with humility
[3835.90 → 3836.90] And forgiveness
[3836.90 → 3838.90] That's it
[3838.90 → 3839.90] Life in Jesus' kingdom
[3839.90 → 3841.90] Is marked with humility
[3841.90 → 3843.90] And forgiveness
[3844.90 → 3846.90] So in the beginning of Matthew 18
[3846.90 → 3848.90] The disciples are arguing about status
[3848.90 → 3849.90] In the kingdom
[3849.90 → 3850.90] Who will be the greatest?
[3850.90 → 3851.90] They ask
[3851.90 → 3852.90] Now on the surface
[3852.90 → 3853.90] Maybe we read that
[3853.90 → 3854.90] And we think
[3854.90 → 3855.90] Well that's a silly question
[3856.90 → 3858.90] But it makes a little bit more sense
[3858.90 → 3859.90] In that culture
[3859.90 → 3861.90] Hierarchy in the ancient Near East mattered
[3861.90 → 3863.90] And the disciples were trying to just figure out
[3863.90 → 3866.90] Some sense of where they would fit
[3866.90 → 3867.90] Into that hierarchy
[3867.90 → 3868.90] If the kingdom of heaven
[3868.90 → 3871.90] Resembled the world that they knew
[3871.90 → 3873.90] There would be some sort of hierarchy
[3873.90 → 3875.90] There would be some who were greater in status
[3875.90 → 3876.90] Than others
[3876.90 → 3878.90] And the disciples were just trying to put their finger
[3878.90 → 3879.90] On that new reality
[3880.90 → 3882.90] Jesus though brings in a child
[3882.90 → 3883.90] Into the circle
[3883.90 → 3884.90] And he basically says
[3884.90 → 3885.90] This kid will be
[3885.90 → 3886.90] I mean not really
[3886.90 → 3887.90] It was a little bit more nuanced than that
[3887.90 → 3888.90] But he says
[3888.90 → 3890.90] To be the greatest in the kingdom
[3890.90 → 3892.90] You must be like this child
[3894.90 → 3895.90] Now children back then
[3895.90 → 3896.90] Had no status
[3896.90 → 3897.90] And no rights
[3897.90 → 3900.90] They were the bottom of the totem pole
[3900.90 → 3901.90] Sorry kids
[3902.90 → 3903.90] More than that
[3903.90 → 3904.90] Children were
[3904.90 → 3905.90] And still are
[3906.90 → 3907.90] Completely dependent
[3907.90 → 3908.90] On their parents
[3908.90 → 3910.90] And the communities in which they live
[3910.90 → 3911.90] To sustain them
[3912.90 → 3913.90] For Jesus
[3913.90 → 3914.90] To become childlike
[3914.90 → 3917.90] Was to become completely dependent
[3917.90 → 3919.90] That was the posture Jesus lifts
[3920.90 → 3921.90] As the starting point for greatness
[3922.90 → 3923.90] In God's kingdom
[3923.90 → 3924.90] Not self-sufficiency
[3925.90 → 3927.90] But trust and dependence
[3928.90 → 3930.90] Now it's important to note real quick
[3930.90 → 3932.90] That Jesus is not calling us to be childish
[3933.90 → 3935.90] Childishness is marked by immaturity
[3935.90 → 3936.90] Or a lack of wisdom
[3936.90 → 3938.90] Or a perspective that still needs to grow
[3939.90 → 3940.90] Paul actually talks about this
[3940.90 → 3942.90] In 1 Corinthians 3 verse 2
[3942.90 → 3943.90] When he says
[3943.90 → 3944.90] He gave the early Christians
[3945.90 → 3946.90] Spiritual milk
[3946.90 → 3947.90] Because they weren't ready
[3948.90 → 3949.90] For solid food yet
[3949.90 → 3951.90] People who were young Christians
[3951.90 → 3952.90] Still needed to grow
[3952.90 → 3953.90] They needed to mature
[3953.90 → 3956.90] We aren't to remain childish in our faith
[3957.90 → 3959.90] We're called to grow in knowledge and maturity
[3960.90 → 3963.90] But being childlike is different
[3964.90 → 3966.90] To be childlike is to acknowledge
[3966.90 → 3967.90] That we are not in control
[3967.90 → 3970.90] It's to live with unabashed trust
[3970.90 → 3971.90] In our Father
[3972.90 → 3973.90] Not because we're naive
[3974.90 → 3975.90] But because we've come to know
[3976.90 → 3978.90] That his care is better
[3979.90 → 3980.90] Than our independence
[3981.90 → 3983.90] This is a call to humility
[3985.90 → 3986.90] But this call to humility
[3987.90 → 3989.90] Runs counter to what the world teaches us
[3990.90 → 3991.90] We're taught to look within ourselves
[3992.90 → 3993.90] To believe in ourselves
[3993.90 → 3995.90] To take control of our own destiny
[3995.90 → 3997.90] To rise up in greatness
[3998.90 → 3999.90] There's a perfect example of this
[4000.90 → 4002.90] It comes from our celebrity world
[4003.90 → 4004.90] There is an actor
[4005.90 → 4006.90] Nisi Nash Beats
[4007.90 → 4008.90] For example
[4008.90 → 4009.90] She won an Emmy recently
[4010.90 → 4011.90] For her role in the Netflix documentary
[4012.90 → 4013.90] Or crime drama Dahmer
[4014.90 → 4015.90] When she won the award
[4016.90 → 4017.90] She got up on stage like they do
[4018.90 → 4021.90] And in a classic award acceptance speech dribble
[4021.90 → 4023.90] She first gave thanks to the Most High
[4024.90 → 4025.90] For this divine moment
[4026.90 → 4027.90] Which calling an award ceremony
[4027.90 → 4029.90] A divine moment is a little cringeworthy enough
[4030.90 → 4031.90] And then after a few very quick thank yous
[4032.90 → 4033.90] To three people she knew
[4034.90 → 4035.90] She paused
[4035.90 → 4036.90] And she slowed down
[4037.90 → 4038.90] She centred herself on stage
[4039.90 → 4040.90] And she enunciated
[4041.90 → 4042.90] And she said this
[4043.90 → 4044.90] And you know who I want to thank?
[4045.90 → 4046.90] I want to thank me
[4047.90 → 4048.90] For believing in me
[4049.90 → 4050.90] And doing what they said I could not do
[4051.90 → 4052.90] And I want to say to myself
[4053.90 → 4054.90] In front of all of you people
[4054.90 → 4055.90] Go on girl
[4055.90 → 4056.90] You did that
[4057.90 → 4058.90] After the ceremony she was interviewed again
[4059.90 → 4060.90] Where she continued this
[4061.90 → 4063.90] She said I'm the only one who knows what it cost me
[4064.90 → 4066.90] How many nights I cried because I couldn't be seen
[4067.90 → 4069.90] I'm proud that I did something people said I could not do
[4070.90 → 4072.90] Because I believed in me
[4072.90 → 4076.90] I hope that this serves as a delicious invitation
[4077.90 → 4078.90] For people to do just that
[4079.90 → 4080.90] Believe in yourself
[4081.90 → 4082.90] And congratulate yourself
[4083.90 → 4085.90] You hear that?
[4086.90 → 4087.90] That's the message
[4088.90 → 4089.90] That speech is a microcosm of the message
[4090.90 → 4091.90] That our world is pumping out to us all the time
[4092.90 → 4093.90] Congratulate yourself
[4094.90 → 4095.90] Treat yourself
[4095.90 → 4096.90] Elevate yourself
[4096.90 → 4097.90] You're worth it
[4097.90 → 4098.90] Believe in you
[4098.90 → 4099.90] And when you do that
[4099.90 → 4101.90] Greatness is around the corner
[4104.90 → 4105.90] That's not what Jesus is saying
[4106.90 → 4108.90] Jesus is saying true greatness
[4109.90 → 4111.90] Doesn't start with congratulations and control
[4112.90 → 4113.90] It starts with surrender
[4114.90 → 4115.90] It doesn't start with you
[4116.90 → 4117.90] It starts with him
[4118.90 → 4119.90] It doesn't start with self-elevation
[4120.90 → 4121.90] But with humility and dependence
[4122.90 → 4123.90] We need to humble ourselves
[4124.90 → 4125.90] And realize that we need God
[4126.90 → 4127.90] Not I need me
[4127.90 → 4132.90] Instead of trying to congratulate yourself
[4133.90 → 4134.90] Or elevate yourself
[4134.90 → 4136.90] Or believe in the power of you
[4137.90 → 4139.90] Jesus calls us to humility
[4140.90 → 4141.90] To dependence
[4142.90 → 4144.90] And to believe in the power of him
[4146.90 → 4147.90] But what is humility then?
[4148.90 → 4149.90] C.S. Lewis has a great quote
[4150.90 → 4151.90] He always seems to
[4151.90 → 4152.90] He says this
[4152.90 → 4154.90] Humility isn't thinking less of yourself
[4155.90 → 4157.90] But thinking of yourself less
[4158.90 → 4159.90] See that's important
[4160.90 → 4161.90] This is not self-depreciating
[4162.90 → 4164.90] It's self-evaluating
[4165.90 → 4167.90] And recognizing we need more than ourselves
[4168.90 → 4169.90] We need Jesus
[4170.90 → 4171.90] We need to think of ourselves less
[4171.90 → 4172.90] And understand we need Jesus completely
[4173.90 → 4174.90] We depend on him
[4175.90 → 4176.90] We humbly acknowledge
[4176.90 → 4177.90] Yet not I but Christ through me
[4177.90 → 4178.90] We just sang that
[4178.90 → 4179.90] Humility matters
[4180.90 → 4181.90] And it's tied completely
[4182.90 → 4183.90] With the second part of our text today
[4184.90 → 4185.90] Forgiveness
[4186.90 → 4188.90] Because we cannot truly forgive
[4189.90 → 4191.90] Until we fully realize
[4192.90 → 4194.90] How utterly dependent on God we are
[4195.90 → 4196.90] Forgiveness cannot happen
[4197.90 → 4198.90] Until we get ourselves out of the way
[4199.90 → 4200.90] Forgiveness only happens
[4201.90 → 4202.90] When we humble ourselves
[4203.90 → 4205.90] When we think of ourselves less
[4205.90 → 4206.90] But we are jumping ahead
[4206.90 → 4207.90] Just a touch
[4208.90 → 4209.90] In the second part of our text today
[4209.90 → 4210.90] Peter asks a question
[4211.90 → 4212.90] Peter asks
[4213.90 → 4214.90] What is the right number of times
[4215.90 → 4216.90] We should forgive someone?
[4217.90 → 4218.90] And then answering his own question
[4218.90 → 4219.90] He says seven times?
[4220.90 → 4222.90] Now it was a common rabbinic teaching
[4223.90 → 4224.90] Back then to forgive someone
[4225.90 → 4226.90] Up to three times
[4227.90 → 4228.90] After that you could stop
[4229.90 → 4230.90] So here Peter is actually trying
[4231.90 → 4232.90] To be super generous
[4232.90 → 4233.90] He says seven times
[4233.90 → 4235.90] Four more than the most righteous rabbi
[4236.90 → 4237.90] But Jesus replies
[4238.90 → 4239.90] He says no Peter
[4240.90 → 4241.90] Not seven times
[4242.90 → 4243.90] Seventy-seven times
[4244.90 → 4245.90] Or as some translations say
[4246.90 → 4247.90] Seventy times seven
[4247.90 → 4248.90] It doesn't matter what the translations say
[4249.90 → 4250.90] Either way
[4250.90 → 4251.90] Jesus is saying
[4252.90 → 4253.90] Forgiveness is not a number
[4254.90 → 4255.90] Forgiveness in his kingdom
[4255.90 → 4256.90] Is not about keeping score
[4257.90 → 4258.90] It's about living out grace
[4258.90 → 4260.90] Jesus tells Peter
[4261.90 → 4262.90] There's no number
[4262.90 → 4263.90] Just forgive
[4263.90 → 4264.90] Be gracious
[4264.90 → 4265.90] Humble yourself
[4265.90 → 4266.90] And forgive others
[4267.90 → 4268.90] He then tells
[4268.90 → 4269.90] What I think is possibly
[4269.90 → 4270.90] The most extreme
[4270.90 → 4272.90] And the most dramatic parable
[4273.90 → 4274.90] That he tells
[4274.90 → 4275.90] So there's a servant
[4275.90 → 4276.90] Who owes
[4277.90 → 4278.90] Ten thousand talents
[4279.90 → 4280.90] To a king
[4281.90 → 4282.90] Now the talent
[4282.90 → 4284.90] Was the largest sum of money
[4284.90 → 4286.90] Or the largest form of currency around
[4286.90 → 4287.90] And ten thousand
[4287.90 → 4288.90] And ten thousand
[4288.90 → 4289.90] Was the largest number
[4289.90 → 4290.90] The Greek language
[4290.90 → 4291.90] Could communicate
[4291.90 → 4292.90] Back then
[4292.90 → 4293.90] So he owed literally
[4293.90 → 4294.90] As much money
[4294.90 → 4296.90] As Jesus could articulate
[4297.90 → 4298.90] To the man
[4298.90 → 4299.90] To the disciples
[4300.90 → 4301.90] He owed literally
[4301.90 → 4302.90] As much as Jesus
[4302.90 → 4303.90] Could fathomable communicate
[4304.90 → 4305.90] A modern day equivalent
[4305.90 → 4306.90] Of ten thousand talents
[4306.90 → 4307.90] Is somewhere in the
[4307.90 → 4308.90] One hundred millions
[4308.90 → 4309.90] To billions
[4310.90 → 4311.90] Alright
[4311.90 → 4312.90] There is no way
[4312.90 → 4313.90] That this servant
[4313.90 → 4314.90] Could repay the king
[4314.90 → 4315.90] The only way
[4315.90 → 4316.90] He could give a fraction
[4316.90 → 4317.90] Of it back
[4317.90 → 4318.90] Was to give the king
[4318.90 → 4319.90] Every asset he had
[4319.90 → 4320.90] And for himself
[4320.90 → 4321.90] His wife and his children
[4321.90 → 4322.90] To be sold to him
[4322.90 → 4323.90] As slaves
[4326.90 → 4327.90] Now this
[4328.90 → 4329.90] Debt
[4330.90 → 4331.90] Represents our debt
[4331.90 → 4332.90] Of sin
[4332.90 → 4333.90] Before a holy God
[4334.90 → 4335.90] The debt of sin
[4336.90 → 4337.90] That we accumulate
[4338.90 → 4340.90] Is so comically high
[4341.90 → 4342.90] Compared to the holiness
[4342.90 → 4343.90] Of the holiness
[4343.90 → 4344.90] Of our God
[4344.90 → 4345.90] That there is no real way
[4345.90 → 4347.90] To actually articulate
[4347.90 → 4348.90] Or communicate it
[4349.90 → 4350.90] It is incomprehensible
[4351.90 → 4352.90] It is innumerable
[4352.90 → 4353.90] And the weight
[4353.90 → 4354.90] Of the debt
[4354.90 → 4355.90] Of our sin
[4355.90 → 4356.90] Is immeasurable
[4358.90 → 4359.90] But in the parable
[4360.90 → 4361.90] The king takes pity
[4361.90 → 4362.90] On the servant
[4362.90 → 4363.90] And forgives the debt
[4363.90 → 4364.90] Wipes it away
[4364.90 → 4365.90] It doesn't exist
[4365.90 → 4366.90] The word here used
[4366.90 → 4367.90] Is actually
[4367.90 → 4368.90] He took pity
[4368.90 → 4369.90] And it's the same word
[4369.90 → 4370.90] In the Greek
[4370.90 → 4372.90] That is used to describe
[4372.90 → 4373.90] Jesus' compassion
[4373.90 → 4374.90] Or his mercy
[4375.90 → 4376.90] The king showed mercy
[4376.90 → 4377.90] Showed compassion
[4377.90 → 4378.90] He forgave the debt
[4379.90 → 4380.90] He took it actually
[4380.90 → 4381.90] Upon himself
[4383.90 → 4384.90] Just like Jesus
[4384.90 → 4385.90] Shows mercy
[4386.90 → 4387.90] And again
[4387.90 → 4388.90] The debt of sin
[4388.90 → 4389.90] That we have been forgiven
[4389.90 → 4390.90] Is the same
[4390.90 → 4391.90] It's gone
[4391.90 → 4392.90] It's been wiped away
[4392.90 → 4393.90] It's been abolished
[4393.90 → 4395.90] Jesus took that on himself
[4395.90 → 4397.90] With his life, death, and resurrection
[4397.90 → 4399.90] Our debt has been paid
[4399.90 → 4400.90] We have been shown mercy
[4400.90 → 4402.90] We have been shown compassion
[4402.90 → 4403.90] Brothers and sisters
[4403.90 → 4404.90] At Emmanuel
[4404.90 → 4406.90] We are this servant
[4407.90 → 4409.90] We have to see that
[4410.90 → 4411.90] Our debt
[4412.90 → 4413.90] Which is far too great
[4413.90 → 4414.90] To measure
[4414.90 → 4415.90] Was utterly
[4415.90 → 4416.90] And completely forgiven
[4416.90 → 4417.90] By Jesus
[4417.90 → 4418.90] At the foot of the cross
[4418.90 → 4419.90] And at the empty tomb
[4419.90 → 4421.90] We are forgiven
[4422.90 → 4423.90] Our debt is paid
[4423.90 → 4426.90] We are coming back to this
[4426.90 → 4428.90] But the story continues
[4428.90 → 4430.90] That same servant
[4430.90 → 4432.90] The one who had a debt
[4432.90 → 4433.90] That he could never repay
[4433.90 → 4436.90] He refuses to show
[4436.90 → 4437.90] That same forgiveness
[4437.90 → 4438.90] To another
[4438.90 → 4439.90] Who owed him
[4439.90 → 4440.90] Only 100 silver coins
[4440.90 → 4441.90] Which is about
[4441.90 → 4442.90] A thousand bucks
[4442.90 → 4443.90] Alright?
[4443.90 → 4444.90] Now a thousand dollars
[4444.90 → 4445.90] Is not insignificant
[4445.90 → 4447.90] But in relation
[4447.90 → 4449.90] To what he was just forgiven
[4449.90 → 4451.90] It is a minuscule amount
[4452.90 → 4453.90] Not only does he refuse
[4455.90 → 4456.90] To forgive
[4456.90 → 4458.90] He shows no mercy
[4458.90 → 4459.90] He chokes the man
[4459.90 → 4461.90] And he throws him in jail
[4462.90 → 4463.90] Well the king finds out
[4463.90 → 4464.90] And the unforgiving
[4464.90 → 4465.90] Servant's future
[4465.90 → 4467.90] Is as bleak as it gets
[4467.90 → 4468.90] He's thrown in jail
[4468.90 → 4469.90] And tortured
[4469.90 → 4471.90] Until the debt can be paid
[4471.90 → 4472.90] Which we know
[4472.90 → 4473.90] Will be never
[4473.90 → 4480.90] Are we still that servant?
[4480.90 → 4484.90] What thousand dollar grudge
[4484.90 → 4486.90] Are we refusing to forgive?
[4486.90 → 4487.90] What bitterness
[4487.90 → 4489.90] Are we holding on to right now?
[4489.90 → 4491.90] Maybe it's not small
[4492.90 → 4493.90] This grudge
[4493.90 → 4494.90] This wrongdoing
[4494.90 → 4496.90] Maybe it's not insignificant
[4496.90 → 4498.90] Maybe it's not even undeserved
[4500.90 → 4502.90] But in light of the weight of sin
[4502.90 → 4503.90] That we've been forgiven
[4503.90 → 4504.90] That grudge
[4504.90 → 4505.90] That bitterness
[4505.90 → 4506.90] Is minimal
[4506.90 → 4507.90] Beyond comparison
[4507.90 → 4509.90] So what bitterness
[4509.90 → 4510.90] Are we clinging to?
[4510.90 → 4512.90] What are we elevating
[4512.90 → 4513.90] More than it needs to?
[4513.90 → 4514.90] What bitterness
[4514.90 → 4516.90] Are we letting take control
[4517.90 → 4518.90] Of who we are?
[4519.90 → 4520.90] What grudge is grown
[4520.90 → 4521.90] In our hearts so large
[4521.90 → 4522.90] That we are unwilling
[4522.90 → 4523.90] To let it go?
[4524.90 → 4526.90] We know that we are
[4526.90 → 4527.90] That servant
[4527.90 → 4528.90] Who has been forgiven
[4528.90 → 4529.90] And praise God for that
[4529.90 → 4530.90] Amen?
[4530.90 → 4533.90] But are we the same servant
[4533.90 → 4535.90] Who refuses to forgive?
[4535.90 → 4539.90] See this parable
[4539.90 → 4540.90] Which is both
[4540.90 → 4541.90] Very extreme
[4542.90 → 4543.90] Yet also parallels
[4544.90 → 4546.90] Our lives so closely
[4547.90 → 4548.90] It highlights something
[4549.90 → 4550.90] Very heavy
[4550.90 → 4552.90] And it needs to sit on us
[4552.90 → 4553.90] With that same kind of weight
[4553.90 → 4555.90] If we are unwilling
[4555.90 → 4556.90] To forgive others
[4556.90 → 4558.90] If we are unwilling
[4558.90 → 4559.90] To forgive
[4559.90 → 4561.90] Those who have wronged us
[4562.90 → 4564.90] We are not actually living out
[4565.90 → 4567.90] The forgiveness that God has granted us
[4567.90 → 4569.90] If we are so stubborn
[4569.90 → 4570.90] That we cannot forgive others
[4570.90 → 4571.90] We are that servant
[4572.90 → 4574.90] Shaking someone over a thousand dollars
[4574.90 → 4576.90] Even though we have been forgiven a billion
[4576.90 → 4577.90] Even though we have been forgiven a billion
[4579.90 → 4580.90] We are forgiven
[4581.90 → 4583.90] Forgiven people must extend forgiveness
[4584.90 → 4585.90] Even if it is hard
[4587.90 → 4589.90] Because that is the truth too, right?
[4590.90 → 4591.90] Like forgiveness is hard
[4592.90 → 4593.90] We can't just blow past that
[4594.90 → 4596.90] It wouldn't be responsible or right of me
[4597.90 → 4600.90] To minimize how difficult forgiveness can be
[4600.90 → 4602.90] How hurt we can become
[4603.90 → 4604.90] People have hurt us
[4605.90 → 4606.90] We have been harmed
[4607.90 → 4609.90] Some of us are hurting immensely
[4610.90 → 4612.90] Forgiveness isn't easy
[4613.90 → 4615.90] It is extremely difficult
[4616.90 → 4618.90] Sometimes it doesn't even seem natural
[4619.90 → 4621.90] And again, I think that is because it isn't
[4622.90 → 4623.90] We want justice
[4624.90 → 4626.90] We want for things to be equal
[4627.90 → 4629.90] The thing is sometimes
[4629.90 → 4631.90] Sometimes we often think we are after justice
[4632.90 → 4634.90] But in reality it is really more like revenge
[4635.90 → 4636.90] We want the scales to be balanced
[4637.90 → 4638.90] We want people to get what they deserve
[4639.90 → 4641.90] That is sort of the default in our fallibility
[4642.90 → 4643.90] But that posture
[4644.90 → 4645.90] This always keeping score
[4646.90 → 4647.90] Always needing payback
[4648.90 → 4649.90] It leads us away from grace
[4650.90 → 4651.90] Not towards it
[4652.90 → 4653.90] We want to see what was wrong brought right
[4654.90 → 4655.90] We want the hurt to be felt
[4656.90 → 4658.90] We want equilibrium in the world around us
[4658.90 → 4659.90] We want
[4660.90 → 4661.90] We want
[4662.90 → 4663.90] We want
[4664.90 → 4666.90] That is not humility, is it?
[4667.90 → 4669.90] That is not thinking of ourselves less
[4670.90 → 4675.90] I have had the opportunity to take a bunch of counselling courses in my school
[4676.90 → 4677.90] And I know others have as well
[4677.90 → 4678.90] So this
[4678.90 → 4680.90] Possibly you can affirm this with me afterwards
[4680.90 → 4683.90] One thing that came to light quite regularly in this class is this
[4683.90 → 4692.90] Is that counsellors often find that forgiveness lies at the heart of many deep personal struggles
[4692.90 → 4696.90] It's forgiveness that's at the root of a lot of people's hardships
[4697.90 → 4699.90] It causes pain and frustration
[4700.90 → 4704.90] And more than that, we start to lose sight of what God says we should be focusing on
[4705.90 → 4708.90] See, when we hold back forgiveness from those who have hurt us
[4708.90 → 4714.90] We often lose sight of just how much we have actually been forgiven by our God
[4715.90 → 4719.90] See, the grace God has poured out is immeasurable
[4720.90 → 4723.90] Because of that, forgiveness must be our response
[4724.90 → 4729.90] An intentional, a wilful choice to live out that grace in real and sometimes very difficult ways
[4729.90 → 4732.90] Grace begets grace which begets grace
[4732.90 → 4737.90] This doesn't mean forgetting the pain or pretending it doesn't matter
[4738.90 → 4741.90] But it does mean recognizing that our own debt was far greater
[4742.90 → 4745.90] And yet it was wiped away by our merciful King
[4746.90 → 4752.90] Now fortunately for us, Jesus not only just tells us that we need to forgive
[4753.90 → 4755.90] He has shown us how to forgive
[4755.90 → 4761.90] See, one of the reasons forgiveness is so hard is that it requires sacrifice and humility
[4762.90 → 4764.90] That's the gospel, sacrifice and humility
[4765.90 → 4768.90] Jesus humbled himself, and he made himself of no reputation
[4769.90 → 4772.90] He came down into this broken world as God incarnate
[4773.90 → 4778.90] And then he lived a perfect life that you and I, that we all fail to live each and every day
[4779.90 → 4782.90] Dying an unbelievably gruesome death on the cross
[4782.90 → 4786.90] Bearing the burden of the weight of the sin of all of humanity on his shoulders
[4787.90 → 4789.90] As our sacrifice
[4790.90 → 4793.90] So that we may be spared judgment and have our sins forgiven
[4794.90 → 4795.90] But death couldn't hold him
[4796.90 → 4799.90] And so three days later he rose from the dead, defeating sin and death
[4800.90 → 4803.90] Forgiving all who call upon his name as Saviour
[4803.90 → 4805.90] For us to be forgiven
[4806.90 → 4807.90] Our God had to stoop
[4808.90 → 4809.90] So low
[4810.90 → 4811.90] So low
[4812.90 → 4813.90] So low that he became one of us
[4814.90 → 4815.90] He humbled himself
[4816.90 → 4817.90] He brought himself into our broken world
[4818.90 → 4819.90] Not as a king in power
[4820.90 → 4821.90] But as a servant in pain
[4822.90 → 4824.90] And he bore the hurt
[4824.90 → 4825.90] The rejection
[4825.90 → 4826.90] The mockery
[4826.90 → 4827.90] The beatings
[4827.90 → 4828.90] The betrayal
[4828.90 → 4829.90] He bore all of it
[4829.90 → 4830.90] And he did so in silence
[4831.90 → 4835.90] Even though just the faintest whisper from his lips
[4836.90 → 4837.90] Could have summoned heaven's armies
[4838.90 → 4839.90] In revenge
[4840.90 → 4841.90] But to forgive us
[4842.90 → 4843.90] Jesus just didn't give up his pride
[4844.90 → 4845.90] He didn't just swallow his righteous anger
[4846.90 → 4847.90] He gave up everything
[4848.90 → 4849.90] He gave up his life
[4849.90 → 4850.90] He held nothing back
[4851.90 → 4854.90] Because that's what forgiveness required
[4855.90 → 4857.90] And he did it for you
[4858.90 → 4859.90] And he did it for me
[4860.90 → 4862.90] Jesus sacrificed himself
[4863.90 → 4864.90] He sacrificed his whole self
[4865.90 → 4866.90] To forgive us
[4867.90 → 4869.90] So yes, forgiveness requires sacrifice
[4870.90 → 4871.90] Forgiveness
[4872.90 → 4873.90] To forgive someone is to lay something down
[4874.90 → 4875.90] Our pride, our stubborn will
[4876.90 → 4877.90] Our right to be angry
[4877.90 → 4880.90] Our grip on whatever it is we think they owe us
[4881.90 → 4882.90] Sometimes it means
[4883.90 → 4884.90] Releasing the ache that feels justified
[4885.90 → 4887.90] Or the fear that seems reasonable
[4888.90 → 4890.90] Or the wound that is still so raw
[4891.90 → 4893.90] But grace should never cling
[4894.90 → 4895.90] It's given
[4896.90 → 4897.90] It's laid down for someone to receive
[4898.90 → 4899.90] Just as Christ laid down his life for us
[4900.90 → 4904.90] See, Jesus showed us in his life, death and resurrection
[4904.90 → 4906.90] That true forgiveness comes from humbling ourselves
[4907.90 → 4908.90] From depending on God
[4909.90 → 4910.90] And ultimately from sacrificing ourselves
[4911.90 → 4915.90] A true disciple of Christ will show forgiveness to others
[4916.90 → 4919.90] As an example of fruit from receiving the gospel
[4920.90 → 4922.90] No hidden agendas, no selfish motivation
[4923.90 → 4927.90] Just forgiveness born out of sacrifice and gospel truth
[4927.90 → 4933.90] Forgiveness is the fruit of a gospel life lived
[4934.90 → 4936.90] Right? You know the carrot and the stick?
[4937.90 → 4938.90] That's the carrot
[4939.90 → 4940.90] If you're a carrot person, if you need positive motivation
[4941.90 → 4942.90] That's that, please hear that
[4943.90 → 4945.90] Forgiveness is the fruit of a gospel life lived
[4946.90 → 4947.90] If you're more of a stick person
[4947.90 → 4949.90] If you need a little harsher motivation, then hear this
[4950.90 → 4953.90] This passage teaches us that independence and forgiveness
[4953.90 → 4954.90] Cannot be part of God's kingdom
[4955.90 → 4956.90] Independence and forgiveness
[4957.90 → 4960.90] Go so completely against the character and nature of our king
[4961.90 → 4962.90] That it can't be there
[4963.90 → 4964.90] If we're to behold our king
[4965.90 → 4966.90] Those characteristics cannot happen
[4967.90 → 4968.90] They cannot be present
[4970.90 → 4971.90] So yeah, forgiveness is hard
[4972.90 → 4974.90] It is sacrificial
[4974.90 → 4977.90] And it's a daily act of will
[4978.90 → 4980.90] And all of that reflects Jesus Christ in this world
[4981.90 → 4983.90] To forgive someone is to humble oneself
[4984.90 → 4987.90] To forgive someone is to reflect Jesus to that person
[4988.90 → 4992.90] Some of you have heard of the person
[4993.90 → 4994.90] Cary Ten Boom
[4995.90 → 4996.90] Sorry, Cory, Cory Ten Boom
[4997.90 → 4998.90] Cary, got it wrong
[4999.90 → 5000.90] Cory Ten Boom
[5001.90 → 5002.90] Cory was a Christian in Holland
[5002.90 → 5004.90] That helped hide Jews during World War II
[5005.90 → 5006.90] Sadly, Cory was eventually captured
[5007.90 → 5009.90] And imprisoned in a concentration camp
[5010.90 → 5011.90] She survived though
[5012.90 → 5013.90] And years later after the war
[5014.90 → 5015.90] She was speaking about forgiveness in a church in Germany
[5016.90 → 5017.90] Believe it or not
[5018.90 → 5020.90] When a former SS guard approached her
[5021.90 → 5023.90] Someone who helped run concentration camps under Hitler
[5024.90 → 5026.90] This guard approached her and didn't recognize her
[5027.90 → 5028.90] Or who she was
[5028.90 → 5030.90] But she recognized him
[5031.90 → 5032.90] As one who had imprisoned her
[5033.90 → 5035.90] This guard approached Cory
[5036.90 → 5037.90] Extended his hand
[5038.90 → 5039.90] And he earnestly asked her
[5040.90 → 5041.90] Will you forgive me?
[5042.90 → 5045.90] Now Cory writes that she couldn't in her heart
[5046.90 → 5048.90] But at that moment she prayed silently
[5049.90 → 5050.90] And asked God for the strength
[5051.90 → 5052.90] She said she chose to raise her hand
[5053.90 → 5055.90] And when she did, she felt God's love and forgiveness
[5055.90 → 5056.90] And she did love and forgiveness flow through her
[5056.90 → 5058.90] And she forgave this man
[5058.90 → 5061.90] She's quoted as saying this profound line
[5062.90 → 5064.90] Forgiveness is not an emotion
[5065.90 → 5068.90] Forgiveness is an act of the will
[5069.90 → 5070.90] And the will can function
[5071.90 → 5073.90] Regardless of the temperature of the heart
[5074.90 → 5078.90] Forgiveness is an act of will
[5079.90 → 5083.90] Which functions regardless of the temperature of the heart
[5083.90 → 5085.90] It must be
[5086.90 → 5087.90] Because forgiveness requires sacrifice
[5088.90 → 5092.90] And at its core it is done when we completely depend on God
[5093.90 → 5097.90] Do we truly know what God has done for us?
[5098.90 → 5102.90] Do we understand the debt, the weight of the debt of sin
[5103.90 → 5105.90] That we have been forgiven?
[5105.90 → 5106.90] That we have been forgiven
[5108.90 → 5110.90] Because if we do our response can only be one thing
[5111.90 → 5115.90] Let us be a community that is marked by radical
[5116.90 → 5119.90] Undeserved, kingdom-shaped forgiveness
[5120.90 → 5123.90] And as we come to the table here today in just a moment
[5124.90 → 5126.90] When we enter into the presence of God
[5127.90 → 5128.90] And remember what he has done for us
[5129.90 → 5130.90] Let us also remember these two things
[5131.90 → 5133.90] That humility means fully depending on God
[5133.90 → 5135.90] For everything
[5136.90 → 5142.90] And that forgiveness means freely extending grace to others
[5143.90 → 5146.90] The same grace that we have received from Jesus Christ
[5147.90 → 5148.90] Amen?
[5149.90 → 5151.90] I'm going to pray, and then Pastor Chris is going to lead us in communion today
[5152.90 → 5153.90] Bow your heads with me
[5153.90 → 5154.90] Father God
[5154.90 → 5161.90] The call to humility is easy to hear but hard to execute
[5162.90 → 5164.90] Lord, around us over and over again we are taught
[5165.90 → 5166.90] To look within ourselves
[5167.90 → 5168.90] To rely on ourselves
[5168.90 → 5169.90] That we are important
[5170.90 → 5172.90] And so pushing away that noise can be difficult
[5173.90 → 5175.90] But Lord, we pray that you will stir in our hearts
[5176.90 → 5180.90] And give us the humility that we need to depend on you for all things
[5180.90 → 5183.90] And as we take that posture, Lord
[5184.90 → 5186.90] May we be able to forgive
[5187.90 → 5189.90] Lord, so many of us have been hurt by people
[5190.90 → 5192.90] Lord, this fallen world
[5193.90 → 5194.90] Sin runs rampant still
[5195.90 → 5196.90] And people hurt us
[5197.90 → 5198.90] And they harm us
[5199.90 → 5201.90] And sometimes it can be so hard to humble ourselves and forgive
[5202.90 → 5204.90] And Lord, I don't want to sugar coat this
[5204.90 → 5206.90] Or make this sound so easy
[5207.90 → 5208.90] But God, will you give us the courage, the strength
[5209.90 → 5211.90] May we depend on you for whatever we need
[5212.90 → 5215.90] To be able to extend the grace that you have extended to us
[5216.90 → 5220.90] Lord, may we be sacrificial as we forgive
[5221.90 → 5223.90] May we show radical forgiveness for those who have hurt us
[5224.90 → 5228.90] Lord, and may we trust in you for all we need to do that well
[5228.90 → 5233.90] Lord, you are our God
[5234.90 → 5235.90] You love us more than we will ever know
[5236.90 → 5237.90] And we love you
[5238.90 → 5241.90] We lay this all down at your feet
[5242.90 → 5243.90] And pray this in your name
[5244.90 → 5245.90] Amen
[5245.90 → 5252.90] As Kevin said, forgiveness is hard
[5253.90 → 5256.90] And in today's world, especially perhaps
[5257.90 → 5259.90] Humility is counterintuitive
[5260.90 → 5263.90] But Jesus promises to strengthen us
[5264.90 → 5265.90] For that journey of life and faith
[5266.90 → 5267.90] At this table
[5268.90 → 5271.90] Kevin said, grace begets grace
[5271.90 → 5275.90] The grace of the word begets the grace of the table
[5276.90 → 5281.90] Which begets grace in your life lived in response to the gospel
[5282.90 → 5284.90] So as we come to the table today
[5285.90 → 5289.90] May all of that be true in your hearts and in your imagination
[5290.90 → 5294.90] As you come and receive the bread and the juice
[5294.90 → 5302.90] May your imaginations be stirred for what is possible in the power of God
[5303.90 → 5305.90] As he meets you here
[5306.90 → 5307.90] God meets us at this table
[5308.90 → 5310.90] We mark that with liturgy and prayer
[5311.90 → 5315.90] And, so I invite you to speak the words that are for you on the screen behind me
[5316.90 → 5319.90] We come because Christ welcomes us here
[5320.90 → 5321.90] And so lift your hearts
[5321.90 → 5326.90] Let us give thanks to the Lord our God
[5327.90 → 5330.90] Let's pray together
[5331.90 → 5336.90] With joy we praise you, gracious God
[5337.90 → 5339.90] For you have created heaven and earth
[5340.90 → 5342.90] You have made us in your image and kept covenant with us
[5343.90 → 5344.90] Even when we fell into sin
[5345.90 → 5348.90] We give you thanks for Jesus Christ
[5348.90 → 5350.90] Who by his life, death and resurrection
[5351.90 → 5354.90] Opened to us the way of everlasting life
[5355.90 → 5356.90] Amen
[5360.90 → 5363.90] Our Lord Jesus, before he suffered
[5364.90 → 5368.90] Gave us this memorial of his sacrifice until he comes again
[5369.90 → 5372.90] And the Lord Jesus on the night that he was betrayed
[5373.90 → 5374.90] Took bread
[5374.90 → 5375.90] And when he had given thanks
[5375.90 → 5377.90] He broke it and said
[5377.90 → 5379.90] This is my body
[5380.90 → 5381.90] Which is for you
[5382.90 → 5385.90] Do this in remembrance of me
[5386.90 → 5388.90] And in the same way
[5389.90 → 5391.90] He took the cup after supper
[5392.90 → 5395.90] Saying this cup is the new covenant in my blood
[5395.90 → 5396.90] Do this whenever you drink it
[5396.90 → 5398.90] Do this whenever you drink it
[5399.90 → 5400.90] In remembrance of me
[5401.90 → 5405.90] For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup
[5406.90 → 5410.90] You proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again
[5411.90 → 5415.90] This is the mystery of our faith
[5415.90 → 5418.90] Your death, O Christ
[5418.90 → 5419.90] Your death, O Christ, we proclaim
[5420.90 → 5422.90] Your resurrection we affirm with joy
[5423.90 → 5425.90] You're coming we await with hope
[5426.90 → 5428.90] Glory be to you, Lord Jesus
[5429.90 → 5430.90] Church family
[5431.90 → 5434.90] The Lord has prepared his table for all who love him
[5435.90 → 5437.90] For all who trust in him alone for their salvation
[5437.90 → 5439.90] And so come to this table
[5440.90 → 5442.90] You who have much faith
[5443.90 → 5445.90] And you who would like to have more
[5446.90 → 5447.90] Come to this table
[5448.90 → 5449.90] You who have been to the sacrament often
[5450.90 → 5452.90] And you who have not been for a long time
[5453.90 → 5454.90] Come to this table
[5455.90 → 5456.90] You who have tried to follow Jesus
[5457.90 → 5460.90] And come you who have failed
[5461.90 → 5462.90] Come to this table
[5462.90 → 5463.90] Come to this table
[5464.90 → 5466.90] Because Jesus Christ is raised
[5467.90 → 5469.90] Because Jesus Christ is king
[5470.90 → 5472.90] This is his banquet feast
[5473.90 → 5475.90] For you and for me
[5476.90 → 5477.90] Come, if you are here
[5478.90 → 5479.90] Or if you are joining us online
[5480.90 → 5482.90] Come, because it is Christ
[5483.90 → 5484.90] Who meets us here
[5485.90 → 5486.90] These are the gifts of God
[5487.90 → 5488.90] For the people of God
[5489.90 → 5492.90] As we come forward to the table
[5493.90 → 5495.90] We will do so in groups
[5496.90 → 5497.90] And the
[5498.90 → 5499.90] We have a couple elders
[5500.90 → 5501.90] Who will indicate when it is time for you to come up to the front
[5502.90 → 5503.90] As you come up
[5503.90 → 5505.90] We will gather in a circle together around the table
[5506.90 → 5507.90] And then we will pass each other
[5508.90 → 5509.90] We will serve each other
[5510.90 → 5511.90] The bread and the juice
[5512.90 → 5513.90] As you pass the bread to the person
[5514.90 → 5515.90] To your left or right
[5515.90 → 5516.90] Please do so by saying
[5516.90 → 5517.90] The body of Christ
[5518.90 → 5519.90] Given for you
[5519.90 → 5520.90] And then as you pass the juice
[5521.90 → 5522.90] Please do so by saying
[5522.90 → 5523.90] The blood of Christ
[5524.90 → 5525.90] Shed for you
[5526.90 → 5528.90] If you are unable to come up to the front
[5529.90 → 5531.90] Please indicate that to the serving elder
[5532.90 → 5533.90] Or the ushers
[5534.90 → 5535.90] They will serve you in your tables
[5536.90 → 5537.90] By saying the same words
[5537.90 → 5538.90] And speaking that over you
[5539.90 → 5540.90] And if you require gluten-free
[5541.90 → 5542.90] There is that available in the trays
[5543.90 → 5544.90] As they go around in those little centre cups
[5546.90 → 5548.90] At this point I would like to invite the worship leaders
[5549.90 → 5550.90] And the back of house people
[5551.90 → 5552.90] The elders who are helping us serve to come forward
[5553.90 → 5554.90] That we might serve them in the first table
[5555.90 → 5556.90] And then they will facilitate our singing
[5557.90 → 5559.90] As we go through this time together
[5559.90 → 5562.90] Let's close the circle
[5563.90 → 5564.90] Yeah
[5565.90 → 5566.90] John come on over
[5567.90 → 5569.90] Body of Christ given for you

[5623.90 → 5624.90] And remember
[5624.90 → 5625.90] dying
[5625.90 → 5627.16] Happy
[5627.90 → 5629.96] Never
[5634.96 → 5635.22] Board of Christ
[5635.22 → 5635.90] God
[5635.90 → 5644.48] Blood of Christ shed for you
[5644.48 → 5646.14] The blood of Christ shed for you.
[5674.48 → 5682.68] It's also for you.
[5688.68 → 5691.28] Drink and believe.
[5697.28 → 5698.16] Amen.
[5698.16 → 5698.30] Amen.
[5698.30 → 5708.94] As people are making their way back from this first group, I forgot to mention, but if
[5708.94 → 5713.82] you would like to pray with someone or meet someone for prayer in lieu of coming to the
[5713.82 → 5719.20] table or before coming to the table or after coming to the table, there are people in the
[5719.20 → 5721.82] foyer there with yellow name tags on that would meet you for that.
[5728.30 → 5730.30] Hey.
[5730.30 → 5732.30] Good morning.
[5732.30 → 5734.30] Hey, brother.
[5734.30 → 5736.30] How we're doing?
[5736.30 → 5738.30] Where's your sister?
[5738.30 → 5739.30] Good morning, buddy.
[5739.30 → 5740.30] My son is kinda amazing.
[5740.30 → 5742.30] Thank you so much for watching.
[5742.30 → 5743.30] My goodness.
[5743.30 → 5745.30] He has a Beethoven cell hands.
[5745.30 → 5747.30] a phoenix.
[5747.30 → 5748.94] 6 us or a green number 2.
[5748.94 → 5751.94] And then if your friend's fit, we swipe to the table.
[5751.94 → 5752.94] That's right.
[5752.94 → 5755.82] 100%, what's the same name?
[5755.82 → 5756.72] That's right.
[5756.72 → 5758.26] We're looking in here.
[5758.26 → 5764.54] And then there are people
[5764.56 → 5766.24] in front of the table.
[5766.24 → 5776.08] Have thine own way, Lord, have thine own way.
[5777.12 → 5782.76] Thou art the potter, I am the clay.
[5783.42 → 5790.52] Hold me and make me after thy will.
[5790.52 → 5797.08] While I am waiting, yielded and still.
[5799.46 → 5805.00] Have thine own way, Lord, have thine own way.
[5806.32 → 5812.08] Search me and try me, Master, today.
[5813.42 → 5819.46] Wonder than snow, Lord, wash me just now.
[5819.46 → 5826.02] As in thy presence, humbly I bow.
[5828.20 → 5834.02] Have thine own way, Lord, have thine own way.
[5835.48 → 5840.70] Wounded and weary, help me, I pray.
[5840.70 → 5848.52] Power, oh power, surely is thine.
[5849.12 → 5854.70] Touch me and heal me, Saviour divine.
[5857.06 → 5863.26] Have thine own way, Lord, have thine own way.
[5863.26 → 5869.88] Hold o'er my being, absolute sway.
[5871.24 → 5877.82] Filled with thy Spirit, till all shall see.
[5878.82 → 5884.88] Christ only, always living in me.
[5884.88 → 5914.86] How great the chasm that lay between us.
[5914.86 → 5921.52] How high the mountain, I could not climb.
[5921.52 → 5927.48] In desperation, I turned to heaven.
[5927.48 → 5934.20] And spoke your name into the night.
[5934.20 → 5940.20] Then through the darkness, your loving kindness.
[5940.20 → 5946.20] Torn through the shadows of my soul.
[5946.20 → 5950.26] The work is finished.
[5950.26 → 5952.80] The end is written.
[5952.80 → 5959.20] Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[5959.20 → 5968.58] Who could imagine so great a mercy?
[5968.58 → 5975.08] What heart could fathom such boundless grace?
[5975.08 → 5981.08] The God of ages stepped down from glory
[5981.08 → 5987.08] To wear my sin and bear my shame.
[5987.08 → 5990.08] The cross has spoken.
[5990.08 → 5993.16] I am forgiven.
[5993.16 → 5999.08] The King of kings calls me his own.
[5999.08 → 6006.08] Beautiful Saviour, I'm yours forever.
[6006.08 → 6012.08] Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[6012.08 → 6013.08] Alleluia.
[6013.08 → 6015.08] Alleluia.
[6015.08 → 6018.08] Praise the one who set me free.
[6018.08 → 6019.08] Alleluia.
[6019.08 → 6020.08] Alleluia.
[6020.08 → 6021.08] Alleluia.
[6021.08 → 6022.08] Alleluia.
[6022.08 → 6023.08] Alleluia.
[6023.08 → 6024.08] Alleluia.
[6024.08 → 6025.08] Alleluia.
[6025.08 → 6028.08] As you have broken every chain.
[6028.08 → 6030.16] There's salvation in your name.
[6030.16 → 6031.16] Alleluia.
[6031.16 → 6038.90] Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[6038.90 → 6043.40] And came the mourning that sealed the promise.
[6043.40 → 6051.20] Your buried body began to breathe out of the silence.
[6051.20 → 6056.26] Out of the silence, the roaring lion
[6056.26 → 6062.48] declared the grave has no claim on me.
[6062.48 → 6068.86] Then came the morning that sealed the promise.
[6069.26 → 6074.00] Your buried body began to breathe.
[6074.00 → 6080.26] Out of the silence, the roaring lion
[6080.26 → 6086.46] declared the grave has no claim on me.
[6087.04 → 6091.26] Jesus, yours is the victory.
[6095.78 → 6101.64] Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free.
[6101.64 → 6107.40] Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me.
[6107.40 → 6113.06] You have broken every chain, his salvation in your name.
[6113.36 → 6118.44] Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[6120.62 → 6124.36] Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free.
[6126.36 → 6129.96] Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me.
[6129.96 → 6135.72] You have broken every chain, his salvation in your name.
[6135.72 → 6140.46] Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[6141.20 → 6145.72] Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[6146.76 → 6151.72] Oh God, you are my living hope.
[6151.72 → 6165.52] And I love you.
[6165.52 → 6184.20] In the darkness we were waiting, without hope, without light,
[6184.20 → 6190.72] till from heaven you came running, there was mercy in your eyes.
[6190.72 → 6196.90] We held the law and prophets to a virgin king the world,
[6197.16 → 6203.44] from a throne of endless glory to a cradle in the dirt.
[6208.40 → 6220.16] Praise the Father, praise the Son, praise the Spirit, three in one.
[6220.16 → 6232.28] God of glory, majesty, praise forever to the King of kings.
[6232.28 → 6242.68] To reveal the kingdom coming, and to reconcile the lost,
[6242.68 → 6248.88] to redeem the whole creation, you did not despise the cross.
[6249.36 → 6254.90] For even in your suffering, you sought to the other side,
[6254.90 → 6261.24] knowing this was your salvation, Jesus, for our sake, you died.
[6261.24 → 6277.24] Praise the Father, praise the Son, praise the Spirit, three in one.
[6277.24 → 6290.24] God of glory, majesty, praise forever to the King of kings.
[6290.24 → 6300.08] And the morning that you rose, all heaven held its breath,
[6300.08 → 6306.66] till that stone was moved for good, for the Lamb had conquered death.
[6307.10 → 6312.90] And the dead rose from the tombs, and the angels stood in awe,
[6312.90 → 6319.04] for the souls of all who come, to the Father are your soul.
[6319.04 → 6325.02] And the church of Christ was born, then the Spirit lit the flame.
[6325.30 → 6330.96] Now this gospel truth of all shall not heal, shall not faint.
[6331.32 → 6336.66] By his blood and in his name, in his freedom I am free.
[6336.66 → 6342.80] For the love of Jesus Christ, who has resurrected you.
[6347.80 → 6359.30] Praise the Father, praise the Son, praise the Spirit, three in one.
[6359.30 → 6382.94] God of glory, majesty, praise the Spirit, three in one.
[6382.94 → 6394.98] God of glory, majesty, praise forever to the King of kings.
[6394.98 → 6402.30] Praise forever to the King of kings.
[6412.94 → 6426.92] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
[6431.40 → 6432.00] Amen.
[6432.00 → 6451.06] Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul,
[6451.06 → 6455.62] Worship His holy name.
[6455.62 → 6462.50] Sing like never before, O my soul,
[6462.92 → 6467.56] I'll worship Your holy name.
[6470.36 → 6477.48] The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning,
[6477.48 → 6482.66] It's time to sing Your song again.
[6482.66 → 6489.54] Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me,
[6490.90 → 6496.70] Let me be singing when the evening comes.
[6499.10 → 6505.92] Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul,
[6505.92 → 6510.16] Worship His holy name.
[6511.16 → 6517.24] Sing like never before, O my soul,
[6517.24 → 6521.48] I'll worship His holy name.
[6521.48 → 6531.72] You're rich in love, and you're slow to anger.
[6531.72 → 6536.96] Your name is great, and your heart is kind.
[6537.62 → 6543.14] For all your goodness I will keep on singing.
[6543.14 → 6551.38] Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.
[6551.38 → 6559.46] Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul,
[6559.46 → 6563.46] Worship His holy name.
[6563.46 → 6570.64] Sing like never before, O my soul,
[6570.64 → 6574.78] I'll worship Your holy name.
[6574.78 → 6583.92] Sing like never before, O my soul,
[6583.92 → 6603.54] And on that day when my strength is failing,
[6603.54 → 6608.92] The end draws near, and my time has come.
[6608.92 → 6614.98] Still my soul will sing Your praise unending.
[6614.98 → 6623.86] Ten thousand years and then forevermore.
[6623.86 → 6630.86] Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul,
[6630.86 → 6635.30] Worship His holy name.
[6635.30 → 6640.24] Sing like never before, O my soul,
[6640.24 → 6645.30] Worship His holy name.
[6645.30 → 6651.24] Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul,
[6651.24 → 6655.86] Worship His holy name.
[6655.86 → 6659.36] Sing like never before,
[6659.36 → 6662.74] O my soul, O my soul,
[6662.74 → 6665.74] Worship His holy name.
[6665.74 → 6671.74] Sing like never before, O my soul,
[6671.74 → 6676.74] Worship His holy name.
[6676.74 → 6681.74] Sing like never before, O my soul,
[6681.74 → 6687.12] I'll worship His holy name.
[6687.12 → 6691.12] I'll worship His holy name.
[6691.12 → 6696.12] Worship your holy name.
[6696.12 → 6701.12] I'll worship your holy name.
[6701.12 → 6731.12] 
[6731.12 → 6736.68] time together. I'm going to invite you to stand that we might receive God's blessing for the
[6736.68 → 6744.92] journey of life and faith ahead, a journey that the Spirit moves in us to walk humbly
[6744.92 → 6753.70] and full of forgiveness. But God goes with us to enable us to do so, and so I invite you to
[6753.70 → 6761.00] open your heart, maybe even your hands, and receive the blessing of our God.
[6761.12 → 6771.34] God, go before you to lead you. God, go behind you to protect you. God, go beneath you to support you.
[6771.72 → 6778.64] God, go beside you to befriend you. Do not be afraid. Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[6778.64 → 6787.06] Do not be afraid, but go in peace to love and serve the Lord. Amen.
[6791.12 → 6793.12] You're the Lion of Judah, the Lamb who was slain. You descended to heaven and evermore will reign. At the end of the age when the earth you reclaim, you will gather the nations before you.
[6793.12 → 6795.12] You will gather the nations before you.
[6795.12 → 6797.12] And the eyes of all men nearly fixed.
[6797.12 → 6798.12] You will gather the nations before you.
[6798.12 → 6801.12] And the eyes of all men nearly fixed.
[6801.12 → 6802.12] You will gather the nations before you.
[6802.12 → 6803.12] You will gather the nations before you.
[6803.12 → 6804.12] You will gather the nations before you.
[6804.12 → 6809.12] You will gather the nations before you.
[6809.12 → 6812.12] And the Lamb who was crucified.
[6812.12 → 6816.12] You will gather the nations before you.
[6816.12 → 6821.12] You will gather the nations before you.
[6821.12 → 6826.12] And the eyes of all men nearly fixed on the lam who was crucified.
[6826.12 → 6837.88] who was crucified with wisdom and mercy and justice you'll reign at your father's side
[6837.88 → 6842.92] and the angels will cry hail the lamb
[6845.64 → 6847.56] who was slain for the world
[6847.56 → 6858.20] rule in power and the earth will reply you shall reign
[6860.92 → 6864.92] as the king of all kings and the lord of all lords
[6872.44 → 6876.20] there's a shield in our hand and a sword at our side
[6876.20 → 6880.20] there's a fire in our spirits that cannot be denied
[6880.20 → 6886.92] as the father has told us for these you have died for the nations that gathered before you
[6887.88 → 6895.56] and the years of all men need to hear of the lamb who was crucified
[6895.56 → 6902.20] who descended to hell yet was raised up to reign and his father's son
[6902.20 → 6912.20] who was slain for the world
[6912.20 → 6914.20] who was slain for the world
[6914.20 → 6916.20] rule in power
[6916.20 → 6920.20] and the earth will reply
[6920.20 → 6924.20] you shall reign
[6924.20 → 6930.20] as the king of all kings and the lord of all lords
[6930.20 → 6932.20] and the angels will cry
[6932.20 → 6934.20] hail the lamb
[6934.20 → 6938.20] who was slain for the world
[6938.20 → 6940.20] rule in power
[6940.20 → 6942.20] rule in power
[6942.20 → 6944.20] and the earth will reply
[6944.20 → 6946.20] and the earth will reply
[6946.20 → 6948.20] you shall reign
[6948.20 → 6950.20] you shall reign
[6950.20 → 6954.20] as the king of all kings and the lord of all lords
[6954.20 → 6958.20] as the king of all kings and the lord of all lords
[6958.20 → 6974.20] who was slain for the world
[6974.20 → 6978.20] as the king of all kings and the bold world
[6978.20 → 6980.20] where the land of all nations
[6980.20 → 6984.20] out there was even the queue part
[6984.20 → 6986.20] of Israel
