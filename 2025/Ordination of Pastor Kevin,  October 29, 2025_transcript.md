[646.32 --> 647.32]  The drum will sound
[647.32 --> 649.32]  The angels will sing
[649.32 --> 650.32]  Hallelujah
[650.32 --> 651.32]  Hallelujah
[651.32 --> 652.32]  Hallelujah
[652.32 --> 656.32]  I am going home
[656.32 --> 659.32]  Where the streets are golden
[659.32 --> 662.12]  Every chain is broken
[662.12 --> 664.92]  Oh, I want to go
[664.92 --> 668.32]  Oh, I want to go home
[668.32 --> 670.72]  Every fear is gone
[670.72 --> 673.88]  I'm in your open arms
[673.88 --> 676.76]  Where I belong
[676.76 --> 682.68]  Where I belong
[682.68 --> 689.80]  I'm going home
[689.80 --> 695.12]  I'm going home
[695.12 --> 701.16]  I'm on my way home
[701.16 --> 706.36]  I'm going home
[706.36 --> 707.16]  I'm going home
[707.16 --> 711.16]  I'm on my way home
[711.16 --> 720.16]  I'm going home
[720.16 --> 744.12]  I'm going home
[744.12 --> 748.28]  I've seen the king of glory
[748.28 --> 752.46]  Coming on the clouds
[752.46 --> 754.02]  With fire
[754.02 --> 757.10]  The whole earth shakes
[757.10 --> 760.78]  The whole earth shakes
[760.78 --> 765.82]  I see his love and mercy
[765.82 --> 771.64]  Washing over all our sin
[771.64 --> 774.68]  The people sing
[774.68 --> 778.52]  The people sing
[778.52 --> 780.94]  Hosanna
[780.94 --> 783.88]  Hosanna
[783.88 --> 788.38]  Hosanna in the highest
[788.38 --> 792.64]  Hosanna
[792.64 --> 794.24]  Hosanna
[794.24 --> 795.50]  Hosanna
[796.64 --> 797.96]  Good evening
[797.96 --> 799.14]  Everyone
[799.14 --> 799.94]  And
[799.94 --> 801.12]  Thank you
[801.12 --> 802.30]  For joining us
[802.30 --> 803.04]  Here at
[803.04 --> 803.94]  Langley
[803.94 --> 804.46]  Emanuel
[804.46 --> 805.84]  A special welcome
[805.84 --> 807.14]  If you are
[807.14 --> 808.14]  A guest here
[808.14 --> 810.08]  If you are
[810.08 --> 810.66]  Visiting
[810.66 --> 811.66]  And representing
[811.66 --> 812.62]  Someone
[812.62 --> 813.48]  Or a group
[813.48 --> 814.76]  We are really excited
[814.76 --> 815.44]  That you are here
[815.44 --> 816.82]  To participate
[816.82 --> 817.66]  In this
[817.66 --> 818.60]  The ordination
[818.60 --> 819.54]  Of
[819.54 --> 820.30]  Kevin Lobert
[820.30 --> 821.70]  As a minister of the word
[821.70 --> 823.04]  In the Christian reformed church
[823.62 --> 828.82]  Later on in our service together, we'll have an opportunity to hear from special guests
[828.82 --> 830.66]  and dignitaries on behalf of Kevin.
[830.94 --> 833.32]  They will be introduced at that point.
[833.98 --> 840.92]  I want to begin with a further invitation, and that's an invitation for after our service
[840.92 --> 845.74]  this evening to hang out in fellowship in the back, and in here there'll be a bit of
[845.74 --> 850.08]  a standing reception where you can all maul Kevin and encourage him with your love and
[850.08 --> 856.42]  support and bless him as he continues to bless us here at Emmanuel.
[857.08 --> 869.52]  We gather tonight for a significant and important purpose in the work of God in the world.
[870.20 --> 878.04]  Today we rejoice in Christ's special care and love for his church since we together have
[878.04 --> 885.18]  the privilege of ordaining Kevin to the ministry of the word in this church and in our denomination.
[885.98 --> 892.32]  Because he has accepted the call of this church, we will now proceed with his ordination and
[892.32 --> 898.14]  installation, and this act tonight is both worshipful and prayerful.
[898.14 --> 905.22]  It is an act of joy, and it is a recognition of God's solemn purposes for the leadership of his church.
[905.64 --> 913.00]  And for that, we give thanks to God, and in that, we know that God is here among us in the power of his spirit.
[913.80 --> 917.22]  We mark that, of course, by receiving God's greeting.
[917.66 --> 923.18]  And so as you're able, I'm going to invite you to stand, and maybe if it's in you to do so,
[923.18 --> 928.86]  to take a posture of receipt, just open your hands, open your hearts, and receive God's welcome
[928.86 --> 931.68]  into this evening and this worship together.
[933.38 --> 942.18]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, Son, and our Savior,
[942.84 --> 945.44]  through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[946.74 --> 947.04]  Amen.
[947.04 --> 953.42]  It's normal in our church, after the greeting is given, to turn and welcome those who are here this evening,
[953.50 --> 958.58]  and so I'm going to invite you to do that as if it were Sunday, because we are in the presence of God and his people.
[958.58 --> 958.78]  Amen.
[958.78 --> 959.22]  Amen.
[959.22 --> 959.78]  Amen.
[959.78 --> 960.22]  Amen.
[960.22 --> 960.32]  Amen.
[960.32 --> 960.72]  Amen.
[960.72 --> 961.22]  Amen.
[961.22 --> 961.86]  Amen.
[961.86 --> 961.94]  Amen.
[961.94 --> 962.00]  Amen.
[962.00 --> 962.50]  Amen.
[962.50 --> 963.00]  Amen.
[963.00 --> 964.00]  Amen.
[964.00 --> 964.08]  Amen.
[964.08 --> 965.00]  Amen.
[965.00 --> 965.08]  Amen.
[965.08 --> 965.14]  Amen.
[965.14 --> 965.18]  Amen.
[965.18 --> 965.24]  Amen.
[977.04 --> 995.18]  Amen.
[995.18 --> 1005.32]  In Psalm 145, the Lord invites us to see, great is the Lord and most worthy of praise.
[1005.32 --> 1008.20]  His greatness no one can fathom.
[1009.20 --> 1014.92]  And he invites us to hear, one generation commends your work to another.
[1015.66 --> 1018.08]  They tell of your mighty acts.
[1018.90 --> 1024.54]  And he invites us to sing, my mouth will speak in praise of the Lord.
[1025.22 --> 1029.16]  Let every creature praise his holy name forever and ever.
[1029.16 --> 1029.22]  Amen.
[1035.32 --> 1057.24]  I will worship, I will worship, I will worship, with all of my heart, with all of my heart.
[1057.24 --> 1065.16]  I will praise you, I will praise you, with all of my strength.
[1065.16 --> 1067.08]  All of my strength.
[1067.08 --> 1075.04]  I will seek you, I will seek you, all of my name.
[1075.04 --> 1077.38]  All of my name.
[1077.48 --> 1084.24]  I will follow, I will follow, all of your way.
[1084.24 --> 1087.66]  All of your praise.
[1087.66 --> 1091.88]  I will give you all my worship.
[1092.96 --> 1097.72]  I will give you all my praise.
[1097.72 --> 1101.96]  You alone, I long to worship.
[1103.08 --> 1107.44]  You alone are worthy of my name.
[1107.44 --> 1109.94]  I will bow down.
[1109.94 --> 1109.96]  I will bow down.
[1109.96 --> 1112.02]  I will bow down.
[1112.02 --> 1114.54]  And hail you as king.
[1114.54 --> 1116.74]  And hail you as king.
[1116.74 --> 1119.70]  I will serve you.
[1119.70 --> 1121.56]  I will serve you.
[1121.56 --> 1123.58]  Give you everything.
[1124.58 --> 1126.88]  Give you everything.
[1127.12 --> 1129.62]  I will lift up.
[1129.62 --> 1131.78]  I will lift up.
[1131.78 --> 1134.20]  My eyes to your throne.
[1134.20 --> 1136.36]  My eyes to your throne.
[1136.36 --> 1139.46]  I will trust you.
[1139.46 --> 1141.62]  I will trust you.
[1141.62 --> 1143.46]  I will trust you alone.
[1144.26 --> 1147.20]  Trust in you alone.
[1147.46 --> 1151.42]  I will give you all my worship.
[1152.50 --> 1157.04]  I will give you all my praise.
[1157.04 --> 1161.26]  You alone, I long to worship.
[1161.26 --> 1166.72]  You alone are worthy of mine.
[1166.72 --> 1171.10]  I will give you all my worship.
[1172.10 --> 1176.56]  I will give you all my praise.
[1176.56 --> 1180.88]  You alone, I long to worship.
[1181.96 --> 1186.64]  You alone are worthy of mine.
[1187.04 --> 1191.42]  You alone, I long to worship.
[1192.72 --> 1196.58]  You alone are worthy of His name.
[1197.26 --> 1200.50]  Now of course there be enough guy.
[1200.50 --> 1201.56]  The beauty of His kind umam.
[1201.56 --> 1205.20]  Most of you and his life dev also of Him is all yours.
[1205.20 --> 1210.58]  Stakes of your church doing great.
[1212.58 --> 1213.64]  Your gift.
[1213.64 --> 1243.62]  Thank you.
[1243.64 --> 1273.62]  Thank you.
[1273.64 --> 1287.82]  Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you, is what it says in Matthew 28.
[1287.82 --> 1317.82] 
[1317.82 --> 1347.82] 
[1347.82 --> 1349.28]  He is a steward in the household of God.
[1349.62 --> 1352.28]  He is a teacher to explain the mystery of the gospel.
[1352.84 --> 1354.86]  He is a shepherd who cares for the flock.
[1355.32 --> 1360.54]  He is an ambassador and a herald to his king, proclaiming the message of reconciliation.
[1361.56 --> 1364.22]  The preaching of the word is one of the ministers' chief tasks.
[1364.82 --> 1372.14]  Such proclamation must faithfully reflect the word of God and relate its needs of the listeners.
[1372.92 --> 1382.24]  Paul stresses the demands when he wrote in 2 Timothy 4 to preach the word, be prepared in season and out of season, correct, rebuke, and encourage.
[1382.24 --> 1392.86]  And because the sacraments are closely related to the preaching of the word, the minister has the privilege of administering holy baptism in the Lord's Supper.
[1393.34 --> 1399.02]  Since the minister has the responsibility to preach the word and to administer the sacraments in public worship,
[1399.02 --> 1406.02]  it is his task to conduct the worship service in such a manner that God receives glory in the congregations edified.
[1408.90 --> 1415.04]  When Jesus said to Peter, feed my lambs, he entrusted the office bearers with special care for the young.
[1415.54 --> 1420.96]  The minister must instruct the baptized members of the congregation in the way of salvation,
[1420.96 --> 1425.60]  and he must also encourage and assist those who teach with him.
[1425.60 --> 1433.08]  Kevin, as a pastor, the minister visits the members of the congregation.
[1433.78 --> 1435.42]  He calls on the sick and suffering.
[1435.80 --> 1437.40]  He comforts those who mourn.
[1437.88 --> 1440.08]  He admonishes those who stray.
[1440.60 --> 1442.94]  He counsels those in need of guidance.
[1443.54 --> 1448.26]  He holds in trust those matters confided to him in counsel or confession.
[1448.92 --> 1451.00]  And he encourages the weak.
[1451.00 --> 1456.00]  He rejoices with those who rejoice and weeps with those who weep.
[1459.00 --> 1464.12]  Yet the minister is called not only to serve those who already are members of the Church of Christ,
[1464.28 --> 1468.02]  but also to engage in and to promote the work of evangelism.
[1468.44 --> 1472.70]  As a true disciple of his master, he should show that the Church exists also for the world
[1472.70 --> 1477.14]  and that the missionary task of the Church forms an essential part of its calling.
[1480.68 --> 1486.32]  As a servant of Christ, the minister must help and encourage the people of God
[1486.32 --> 1494.64]  as they care for the hungry, the thirsty, the strangers, the naked, the sick, and those in prison.
[1494.64 --> 1504.68]  In all his work, the minister proclaims, explains, and applies Holy Scripture
[1504.68 --> 1510.48]  in order to gather in and build up the members of the Church of Jesus Christ.
[1511.34 --> 1515.92]  For this work, the minister devotes himself to the ministry of prayer,
[1516.70 --> 1523.02]  joining all Christians in confession, intercession, thanksgiving, and praise.
[1524.64 --> 1554.62]  For this work, the minister will be a part of the Church of Jesus Christ.
[1554.64 --> 1584.62]  I am a part of the Church of Jesus Christ.
[1584.62 --> 1591.40]  The wisdom will stand and you'll never do.
[1593.16 --> 1599.98]  So I throw up my hands, praise you again and again.
[1599.98 --> 1610.98]  Cause all that I have is a hallelujah, hallelujah.
[1610.98 --> 1618.02]  I know it's not much, but nothing else did for me.
[1618.02 --> 1630.44]  Except for our singing hallelujah, hallelujah.
[1630.44 --> 1636.44]  I've got one response.
[1638.48 --> 1641.44]  I've got just one move.
[1641.44 --> 1650.44]  When my arms stretch wide, I will worship you.
[1651.58 --> 1657.44]  So I throw up my hands, praise you again and again.
[1657.44 --> 1669.44]  Cause all that I have is a hallelujah, hallelujah.
[1669.44 --> 1676.28]  I know it's not much, but nothing else did for me.
[1676.84 --> 1686.44]  Except for our singing hallelujah, hallelujah.
[1686.44 --> 1699.20]  Come on, my soul.
[1699.48 --> 1703.82]  Oh, don't you get shy on me, live another song.
[1703.82 --> 1708.52]  Cause you've got a lion inside of those lungs.
[1709.02 --> 1712.42]  Get up and praise the Lord.
[1712.42 --> 1717.46]  Come on, my soul.
[1717.46 --> 1721.96]  Oh, don't you get shy on me, live another song.
[1721.96 --> 1726.68]  Cause you've got a lion inside of those lungs.
[1726.68 --> 1730.24]  Get up and praise the Lord.
[1733.24 --> 1735.40]  Come on, my soul.
[1735.76 --> 1739.96]  Oh, don't you get shy on me, live another song.
[1739.96 --> 1744.58]  Cause you've got a lion inside of those lungs.
[1744.58 --> 1748.34]  Get up and praise the Lord.
[1748.34 --> 1750.60]  Come on, Road찜, dost you, Jesus.
[1750.60 --> 1752.70]  Yeah.

[1755.28 --> 1755.96]  we recib a psst.
[1755.96 --> 1757.78]  We facing terapevally, live another song.
[1757.78 --> 1759.06]  Everyone was inspired by surrender of your life.
[1759.60 --> 1760.58]  You've got a look, Lord, wife and Taxi,
[1760.58 --> 1761.40]  the Lord.
[1761.40 --> 1773.28]  Oh, don't you.
[1773.28 --> 1783.70]  So I throw my hands, praise you again and again.
[1784.26 --> 1794.70]  All that I have is a hallelujah, hallelujah.
[1796.22 --> 1801.66]  And I know it's not much, but nothing else did for a king.
[1803.28 --> 1814.00]  Except for a heart singing hallelujah, hallelujah.
[1814.00 --> 1816.00]  Hallelujah.
[1816.00 --> 1816.64]  Hallelujah.
[1816.64 --> 1817.20]  Hallelujah.
[1817.20 --> 1817.76]  Hallelujah.
[1817.76 --> 1818.40]  Hallelujah.
[1830.58 --> 1834.20]  My name is Dave Gruen and I serve as a pastor at Hope Community Church.
[1834.20 --> 1837.86]  And I've known Kevin for a long time.
[1838.80 --> 1841.18]  Almost, I don't know, 25 years now.
[1841.52 --> 1843.20]  We studied at Redeemer with Chris.
[1843.54 --> 1846.08]  All the good pastors moved from the east to the west, by the way.
[1846.94 --> 1849.72]  And then we served in eight years in youth ministry.
[1849.80 --> 1851.30]  And I thought I served for a long time.
[1851.38 --> 1855.20]  And then Kevin just showed me up big time by serving for 17 years in youth ministry.
[1855.20 --> 1862.52]  And it is a real privilege, Kev, to be part of your ordination and for me to have you share your ordination vows.
[1862.62 --> 1864.18]  So at this time, I want to invite you up on the stage.
[1868.12 --> 1871.48]  And I think all of us should be stunned at how well Kevin is dressed.
[1872.28 --> 1873.66]  Am I allowed to name that?
[1875.42 --> 1876.00]  It's true.
[1876.00 --> 1879.54]  I figured I wasn't the only one who thought it.
[1881.48 --> 1884.38]  One of the things that we learn in ministry is the importance of vows.
[1884.84 --> 1886.90]  It's actually a very rare thing to witness them.
[1887.52 --> 1890.54]  You will only really see them at weddings between husbands and wives.
[1890.74 --> 1894.00]  And the other situation you'll see them is in churches with office bearers.
[1894.00 --> 1902.38]  And today, we witness the significance of a vow that Kev is making to serving the Church of Jesus Christ faithfully with the gifts that God has given you.
[1902.38 --> 1909.00]  And I've heard from pastors who've served for many years, one of whom is almost at 50 years in ministry, Martin Cantant, this month,
[1909.12 --> 1912.22]  who have said that there's many seasons where you return to the vow.
[1913.18 --> 1915.00]  Seasons where it's no longer easy to pastor.
[1915.80 --> 1920.64]  And I hope that this vow holds weight to you and to your church in years ahead.
[1921.06 --> 1922.52]  So Kev, I'm going to ask you four questions.
[1923.08 --> 1926.20]  And after those four questions, I'm going to ask you to respond appropriately.
[1927.22 --> 1929.66]  Yes, hopefully that answer is, I do, God helping me.
[1929.66 --> 1940.46]  So first and foremost, Kev, do you believe that this call of a manual Christian reformed church is actually a call from God himself into the ministry in this congregation?
[1941.78 --> 1944.82]  Secondly, do you believe that the Old and New Testament are the word of God?
[1945.60 --> 1949.30]  They are the only infallible rule of faith and of life.
[1950.36 --> 1957.04]  Third, do you ascribe to the doctrinal standards of this church, rejecting all the teaching which contradicts them?
[1957.04 --> 1964.48]  And fourth, do you promise to be a faithful minister, to conduct yourself in a manner worthy of your calling,
[1964.84 --> 1968.86]  and to submit to the government and the discipline of the church?
[1969.84 --> 1971.26]  Kevin Loebert, what is your answer?
[1972.06 --> 1973.10]  I do, with God's help.
[1973.90 --> 1974.16]  Amen.
[1975.38 --> 1979.60]  At this time, I think I'm going to invite the officiating pastor to lead us in a time of prayer.
[1979.66 --> 1980.40]  Do you want me to do that?
[1980.98 --> 1982.00]  You want me to do that?
[1983.54 --> 1984.46]  That's perfect.
[1984.46 --> 1991.86]  At this time, I'm going to invite the elders and the deacons, as well as pastors who are locally here to pray for Kev.
[1991.90 --> 1992.30]  Come on up.
[1992.32 --> 1993.20]  We're going to lay hands on him.
[1993.56 --> 1994.42]  I'm going to pray for him.
[1998.82 --> 1999.26]  Absolutely.
[1999.82 --> 2001.18]  Family is more than welcome.
[2001.18 --> 2015.86]  I'm going to allow people to pray, and I'm going to call on...
[2015.86 --> 2018.38]  I'm looking for Justin Roekema to lead this prayer.
[2018.44 --> 2021.50]  You can just pass the mic around, and Justin, you're going to start this prayer.
[2022.62 --> 2024.36]  You want me to start and then others...
[2024.36 --> 2026.12]  Pass it around and I'll close the prayer.
[2026.12 --> 2027.16]  Okay.
[2027.34 --> 2027.98]  Thanks, Dave.
[2031.70 --> 2032.42]  Let's pray.
[2035.02 --> 2037.64]  Almighty God, we're so thankful to you for Kevin.
[2037.82 --> 2039.86]  We're so thankful for the gifts that you've given him.
[2040.62 --> 2043.26]  For all the ways that you've blessed him through years of ministry.
[2043.62 --> 2049.34]  For the blessing that he's been on this church, but also fellow pastors.
[2049.52 --> 2051.28]  The gift he's been to fellow pastors as well.
[2051.28 --> 2061.16]  We're thankful for this day to think about the way in which you've poured your spirit out on him.
[2061.54 --> 2065.62]  And we're thankful for that gift in Kevin's life and ministry.
[2065.72 --> 2068.56]  And we pray that you continue to bless him in that way.
[2072.06 --> 2076.00]  Living God, we thank you for the gift that Kevin has been to so many who are in this space.
[2076.28 --> 2077.36]  And so many who aren't here.
[2077.74 --> 2079.86]  Lord, the impact that you have had through him.
[2079.86 --> 2085.16]  And we pray, Lord, now that as he enters into a new chapter of ministry,
[2085.66 --> 2092.00]  walking in step with you and seeking to walk on his knees, to walk in prayer with you,
[2092.56 --> 2097.54]  to step forward into what your will is for him in this role here at Emmanuel.
[2098.02 --> 2101.58]  Lord, we ask that your spirit would go with him in powerful and in mighty ways,
[2101.72 --> 2105.92]  that he may know that your spirit is his constant companion
[2105.92 --> 2109.80]  and that you have led him here for such a time as this.
[2122.80 --> 2129.32]  Heavenly Father, even as our hands settle on Kevin's shoulders,
[2129.32 --> 2135.76]  may the mantle of service to your church settle there on him as well.
[2137.12 --> 2146.26]  May the authority that comes with this ordination be one that he wears well and with integrity,
[2146.62 --> 2149.10]  with purpose and devotion.
[2149.10 --> 2160.02]  And Jesus, just as you have invited us all to take your yoke upon our shoulders,
[2160.68 --> 2163.68]  may Kevin take this responsibility on his,
[2164.12 --> 2168.04]  knowing that he is taking on your calling and your equipping.
[2168.04 --> 2173.26]  clothe him so completely with yourself, Lord Christ,
[2173.34 --> 2178.56]  that whenever anyone sees him or hears him, they see and hear you.
[2178.56 --> 2189.76]  God, right now, I want to bring Nikki to you as well.
[2190.16 --> 2194.70]  God, I thank you for her and I thank you for the support that she has been to Kev through his entire ministry.
[2195.36 --> 2201.32]  I pray that you give her what she stands in need of as they enter this new role together as a couple and as a family.
[2201.32 --> 2201.44]  Amen.
[2208.56 --> 2212.96]  Father, we praise you that before Kevin was even born, your hand was on his life.
[2214.14 --> 2218.38]  You knew every day that he would walk and you knew, Lord, that he would serve in this role.
[2218.46 --> 2221.64]  And we praise you that you will equip him to be faithful in this role.
[2222.46 --> 2229.20]  We thank you for the gifts he has, for his humility, his shepherd's heart, his love for your church,
[2229.60 --> 2231.98]  his laughter, his joy in ministry.
[2232.76 --> 2234.14]  Lord, would you protect these gifts?
[2234.88 --> 2236.18]  Would you use these gifts?
[2236.18 --> 2240.00]  Would you give him spiritual authority to lead as a servant of Jesus?
[2240.44 --> 2244.48]  And we do pray that the season ahead in this church, in this congregation,
[2244.48 --> 2248.06]  would be filled with kingdom fruit, would be filled with joy,
[2248.50 --> 2250.62]  where Kevin would see you leading him.
[2251.20 --> 2255.28]  And I pray that you give him the confidence to know that there is no place he walks in ministry.
[2255.88 --> 2261.14]  There is no situation he enters into where you do not walk with him as the Lord of the church.
[2261.40 --> 2262.84]  And it is your name we pray.
[2263.22 --> 2263.50]  Amen.
[2263.50 --> 2263.60]  Amen.
[2265.00 --> 2265.44]  Amen.
[2266.18 --> 2268.18]  Amen.
[2284.38 --> 2286.12]  Chris, who's leading the vows of the congregation?
[2287.70 --> 2288.02]  What?
[2288.74 --> 2291.28]  When it says officiating minister, that's you.
[2291.28 --> 2291.38]  Amen.
[2291.38 --> 2296.84]  Yeah, come on up.
[2296.92 --> 2297.48]  Come on up, Kev.
[2299.32 --> 2300.02]  Hi, everyone.
[2300.10 --> 2301.14]  My name is Jenna Fabiano.
[2301.68 --> 2303.28]  I'm a pastor over at Willoughby Church.
[2303.72 --> 2307.44]  And I've had the joy of knowing Kevin for the last seven years, I think.
[2307.78 --> 2312.64]  Ever since a mutual friend of ours gathered a few of us pastors to regularly have lunch together,
[2313.14 --> 2319.14]  it's been a joy to get to know Kevin, to learn from you and your many, many, many years of ministry.
[2319.14 --> 2327.90]  But more importantly, to see how the spirit of Jesus Christ is so clearly at work in you.
[2328.10 --> 2329.30]  So it's a real privilege to be here.
[2329.58 --> 2329.96]  Thank you.
[2331.24 --> 2334.60]  Members of the congregation, I'm going to invite you to stand right now.
[2335.06 --> 2337.22]  You are going to make a vow to Kevin.
[2337.22 --> 2343.64]  And I will invite you to respond at the end with what we do with God's help.
[2343.64 --> 2353.12]  Church family of Langley Emmanuel, do you, in the name of the Lord, welcome Kevin as your minister and pastor?
[2354.00 --> 2358.18]  Do you promise to take to heart the word of God as he proclaims it?
[2358.84 --> 2363.26]  Do you promise to pray for him, to share with him in the work of his ministry,
[2363.78 --> 2366.40]  to encourage him in the exercise of his tasks,
[2366.40 --> 2371.58]  and to respond to his work with obedience, love, and respect?
[2372.26 --> 2373.76]  Church family, what is your answer?
[2374.46 --> 2377.66]  Thank goodness.
[2378.02 --> 2379.50]  All right, you can have a seat.
[2380.72 --> 2381.58]  No, no.
[2381.58 --> 2389.86]  I now have the wonderful privilege of being able to offer a commission and a congratulations to both you and to your church family.
[2389.86 --> 2394.62]  Kevin, dear brother and fellow servant of Christ,
[2395.30 --> 2399.50]  we rejoice with you on this day that after years of preparation,
[2400.20 --> 2403.10]  you have been ordained to the ministry of the word.
[2404.22 --> 2407.86]  May you experience much joy in fulfilling your calling.
[2408.86 --> 2412.12]  As you exercise the authority of the office entrusted to you,
[2412.46 --> 2414.64]  may you always remain a humble servant.
[2414.64 --> 2418.28]  Look faithfully after the whole flock,
[2418.84 --> 2420.26]  the old and the young,
[2420.88 --> 2423.00]  the faithful and the unfaithful,
[2423.48 --> 2424.84]  the healthy and the sick,
[2425.42 --> 2426.64]  the strong and the weak.
[2427.88 --> 2429.36]  Rejoice with those who rejoice,
[2429.66 --> 2431.02]  and suffer with those who suffer.
[2432.32 --> 2435.58]  Use all your talents to the utmost of your ability,
[2435.96 --> 2438.64]  and do not neglect any of your gifts.
[2439.64 --> 2443.06]  And one day, our chief shepherd will give you the crown of glory,
[2443.06 --> 2445.54]  saying, well done, good and faithful servant.
[2446.86 --> 2448.96]  And to you, dear fellow Christians,
[2449.30 --> 2450.58]  congratulations also.
[2451.34 --> 2453.56]  This is truly the day which the Lord has made.
[2454.04 --> 2455.72]  Let us rejoice and be glad in it.
[2457.20 --> 2459.64]  Congregation, keep your vows.
[2460.90 --> 2463.44]  Receive your minister as a gift of God.
[2464.64 --> 2467.34]  Listen to him with all the respect due his office.
[2468.30 --> 2469.96]  Encourage him when he needs strength,
[2469.96 --> 2472.18]  and pray for him daily.
[2473.50 --> 2476.04]  Anyone who receives a prophet because he is a prophet
[2476.04 --> 2477.80]  will receive a prophet's reward.
[2478.98 --> 2481.90]  May you, as pastor and congregation,
[2482.74 --> 2486.00]  live as the bride longing for the coming of our heavenly bridegroom,
[2486.54 --> 2488.92]  praying, come, Lord Jesus, come.
[2490.06 --> 2490.38]  Amen.
[2491.54 --> 2492.72]  Let's continue in worship.
[2492.72 --> 2492.90]  Amen.
[2492.90 --> 2492.92]  Let's continue in worship.
[2492.92 --> 2492.96]  Amen.
[2499.96 --> 2509.12]  Amen.
[2523.50 --> 2524.06]  Amen.
[2524.06 --> 2524.48]  Amen.
[2524.48 --> 2524.80]  Amen.
[2524.82 --> 2524.98]  Amen.
[2524.98 --> 2527.98]  Amen.
[2541.42 --> 2546.10]  All of the creation, all of the earth,
[2546.10 --> 2550.64]  Make straight highway, path for the Lord.
[2550.64 --> 2556.98]  Jesus is coming soon.
[2558.54 --> 2563.36]  All that sinner, wake up the saint,
[2563.82 --> 2567.86]  Then every nation shall help the faith.
[2568.94 --> 2573.36]  Jesus is coming soon.
[2573.36 --> 2581.74]  Like a ride waiting for her room,
[2582.04 --> 2587.20]  We'll be a church ready for you every heart.
[2587.62 --> 2592.64]  Longing for our King, we sing.
[2592.64 --> 2599.32]  Even so, run for Jesus, come.
[2600.82 --> 2607.98]  Even so, run for Jesus, come.
[2610.36 --> 2615.02]  There will be justice, all will be you.
[2615.02 --> 2619.58]  Your name forever, faithful and true.
[2620.90 --> 2625.44]  Jesus is coming soon.
[2628.24 --> 2633.84]  Like a ride waiting for her room,
[2634.24 --> 2639.30]  We'll be a church ready for you every heart.
[2639.30 --> 2644.80]  Longing for our King, we sing.
[2645.18 --> 2647.48]  Even so, come.
[2647.98 --> 2651.72]  For Jesus, come.
[2653.56 --> 2656.04]  Even so, come.
[2656.56 --> 2660.26]  For Jesus, come.
[2660.26 --> 2685.86]  So we wait, we wait for you.
[2685.86 --> 2691.26]  God, we wait for you.
[2691.26 --> 2693.42]  God, we wait for you.
[2693.42 --> 2695.54]  You're coming soon.
[2695.54 --> 2704.42]  So we wait, we wait for you.
[2704.42 --> 2709.42]  God, we wait for you.
[2709.42 --> 2713.42]  You're coming soon.
[2713.42 --> 2743.40]  So we wait, we wait for you.
[2743.40 --> 2750.40]  You're coming soon.
[2750.40 --> 2755.82]  Like a ride waiting for her room,
[2755.82 --> 2761.18]  We'll be a church ready for you every heart.
[2761.18 --> 2766.48]  Longing for our King, we sing.
[2767.68 --> 2772.66]  Like a ride waiting for her room,
[2772.66 --> 2774.66]  We'll be a church ready for you every heart.
[2774.66 --> 2777.66]  We'll be a church ready for you every heart.
[2777.66 --> 2782.66]  Longing for our King, we sing.
[2782.66 --> 2784.66]  Even so, come.
[2784.66 --> 2788.44]  Even so, come.
[2788.44 --> 2790.62]  Even so, come.
[2790.66 --> 2794.14]  For Jesus, come.
[2794.14 --> 2795.50]  Even so, come.
[2795.50 --> 2799.54]  Lord Jesus, come.
[2801.68 --> 2804.34]  Be this hope, come.
[2804.34 --> 2808.94]  Lord Jesus, come.
[2825.50 --> 2830.84]  Good evening.
[2830.84 --> 2833.40]  Congratulations, Kevin.
[2833.40 --> 2841.54]  As clerk of council, it's my pleasure to introduce our guests for,
[2841.54 --> 2845.86]  they're going to be saying a few words this evening.
[2845.86 --> 2849.66]  But first, I do also have a letter from Eric Woodward,
[2849.66 --> 2851.26]  the mayor of the township of Langley.
[2851.26 --> 2853.40]  I'll just read that out loud here for everyone.
[2853.40 --> 2857.50]  Dear members of Langley Christian Reformed Church,
[2857.50 --> 2861.54]  on behalf of township council and the residents of Langley,
[2861.54 --> 2865.94]  it's my honor to extend heartfelt congratulations on the ordination of Mr.
[2865.94 --> 2869.04]  Kevin Lobert to the office of Minister of the Word
[2869.04 --> 2871.88]  in the Christian Reformed Church in North America.
[2872.56 --> 2877.06]  The township of Langley deeply values the presence and contributions
[2877.06 --> 2881.12]  of faith communities such as Langley Emanuel Christian Reformed Church,
[2881.12 --> 2884.76]  your ongoing commitments to spiritual guidance, social support,
[2884.76 --> 2888.16]  and community well-being enriches the lives of many across our community,
[2888.16 --> 2889.26]  our municipality.
[2889.26 --> 2893.66]  Please accept our sincere congratulations and best wishes
[2893.66 --> 2896.06]  as you celebrate this joyful occasion.
[2896.06 --> 2897.98]  Sincerely, Eric Woodward.
[2897.98 --> 2908.02]  Our first guest here is Joe Ladum, consistency,
[2908.02 --> 2914.22]  my words are not coming out right here, assistant for MLA, Harmon Mungu.
[2914.22 --> 2922.76]  Good evening, everyone.
[2922.76 --> 2927.86]  Good evening, everybody.
[2927.86 --> 2931.68]  My name is Joe Ladum, and I'm MLA Harmon Mungu's constituency assistant.
[2931.68 --> 2934.14]  Unfortunately, MLA Mungu is in Victoria,
[2934.14 --> 2936.38]  but he asked me to say a few words on his behalf.
[2936.38 --> 2939.34]  Today we gather to celebrate a truly special moment,
[2939.34 --> 2940.88]  the ordination of Kevin Lobert.
[2940.88 --> 2943.52]  Kevin, this is not just a milestone in your life,
[2943.52 --> 2946.32]  but a powerful testimony of your faith, your calling,
[2946.32 --> 2948.12]  and your dedication to serving others.
[2948.12 --> 2951.32]  Throughout your journey, you've shown humility, compassion,
[2951.32 --> 2953.52]  and a steadfast commitment to God's word.
[2953.52 --> 2956.32]  You've inspired those around you with your integrity,
[2956.32 --> 2958.84]  your kindness, and your willingness to lead by example.
[2958.84 --> 2961.44]  As you step into this new chapter of ministry,
[2961.44 --> 2964.60]  may you continue to be a vessel of grace, a voice of hope,
[2964.60 --> 2966.40]  and a shepherd to all who seek guidance.
[2966.40 --> 2970.04]  Through your leadership, many lives will be touched and hearts renewed.
[2970.04 --> 2970.88]  Congratulations.
[2970.88 --> 2971.88]  Thank you.
[2971.88 --> 2972.88]  Thank you.
[2972.88 --> 2985.52]  Next, I'll call for Reverend Wout Brower on behalf of MP Teiko Venpapta.
[2985.52 --> 2996.88]  Kevin, it's my honour to be here tonight on behalf of our member of parliament, Teiko Venpapta.
[2996.88 --> 3003.88]  Parliament is in session, so he's in Ottawa, and he asked me to be here representing him.
[3003.88 --> 3011.52]  And so on behalf of Mr. Venpapta and the government of Canada, I want to wish you congratulations
[3011.52 --> 3015.16]  and thank you for your support and God's rich blessings on your ministry.
[3015.16 --> 3019.52]  I have a memento here for you to mark the occasion.
[3019.52 --> 3020.52]  And I want you to stay there.
[3020.52 --> 3026.16]  I would like to congratulate you.
[3026.16 --> 3032.16]  But also, as a fellow minister of the word, I want to pass on my personal congratulations,
[3032.16 --> 3040.80]  and I pray that in the words of Jesus, you might bear much fruit with great joy as you serve Christ in his church and his kingdom,
[3040.80 --> 3045.80]  and that God's richest blessing would rest upon not only you but your family.
[3045.80 --> 3047.80]  Congratulations.
[3047.80 --> 3048.80]  Thank you.
[3048.80 --> 3049.80]  Thank you.
[3049.80 --> 3054.80]  Thank you.
[3054.80 --> 3064.80]  Next up, we have a Reverend Stephen Birkenpass of Living Hope CRC on behalf of classes BC Southeast.
[3064.80 --> 3065.80]  All right.
[3065.80 --> 3083.80]  Well, my name is Stephen Birkenpass, as he mentioned, and for those of you at Emanuel, I'm the youngest of Pete and Doreen.
[3083.80 --> 3091.80]  And this means they've been here a long time, and I've grown up here just looking at these fans.
[3091.80 --> 3097.80]  I have lots of memories staring at those fans as the pastors talked about stuff.
[3097.80 --> 3110.80]  But this also is a place where I got to learn about who God is and how God calls us into ministry where my imagination got to grow.
[3110.80 --> 3114.80]  And a big part of that was through the ministers that served here.
[3114.80 --> 3124.80]  And as they depended on Christ to guide, now there's this new opportunity for you to step into that in a new way.
[3124.80 --> 3140.80]  So on behalf of BC Southeast and classes, I just want to give a note of our excitement to see how you are going to kind of step into that same legacy of pastors that have gone before you.
[3140.80 --> 3148.80]  And showing Christ that people can grow in who they are, that they can see God working in their lives in new ways.
[3148.80 --> 3161.80]  And also that as you step into this, that you're going to have new ways in which you can lean into your faith and where Christ can sustain you and where you can see Christ going ahead of you.
[3161.80 --> 3162.80]  So blessings.
[3162.80 --> 3163.80]  Thank you.
[3163.80 --> 3165.80]  Thank you.
[3165.80 --> 3176.80]  And our last guest here is Reverend Gord Schultz, Mountain View Alliance on behalf of Langley Aerial Ministerial.
[3176.80 --> 3177.80]  Thank you.
[3177.80 --> 3178.80]  Thank you.
[3178.80 --> 3179.80]  Thank you.
[3179.80 --> 3180.80]  Thank you.
[3180.80 --> 3181.80]  Thank you.
[3181.80 --> 3187.80]  Such a joy to be here with you whenever the guy, the pastor comes up with a folder and paper.
[3187.80 --> 3189.80]  It's never a good sign, but don't worry.
[3189.80 --> 3190.80]  It's one page.
[3190.80 --> 3191.80]  It's not even a full page.
[3191.80 --> 3200.80]  I have known Kevin now for about 30 minutes actually.
[3200.80 --> 3203.80]  So this is, it's been a pleasure.
[3203.80 --> 3210.80]  I actually did, I think we did meet at TWU so we have a similar heart of love for the students.
[3210.80 --> 3217.92]  I'm Pastor Gord and I am from Mountain View and I am representing the Langley Ministerial
[3217.92 --> 3225.18]  and this is a group that meets once a month and we we just gather in prayer we pray for one another
[3225.18 --> 3232.32]  and we pray for our city and I just want to offer an encouragement to you Kevin twofold
[3232.32 --> 3239.86]  as I've thought about this moment I'm thrilled simply that there is another pastor being ordained
[3239.86 --> 3248.64]  because we need more pastors in Canada as many of you probably know there is a growing shortage
[3248.64 --> 3256.90]  actually of pastors right now they say statistically Canada will need 325 new pastors for every year
[3256.90 --> 3264.28]  for the next 12 years just to replace those who are retiring right now so I just want to personally
[3264.28 --> 3268.72]  and on behalf of the ministerial bless you in this step of faith and following God's calling in your
[3268.72 --> 3277.42]  life but then the other second encouragement is that you Kevin are stepping into this precious
[3277.42 --> 3282.92]  and glorious role of being a minister of God's Word and though I'm from a different denomination
[3282.92 --> 3290.38]  I as we began the service my heart was already just linked to everyone here because I could sense your
[3290.38 --> 3297.20]  passion for the Word your love of worship and the joy of the ministry of the Holy Spirit that's just
[3297.20 --> 3304.76]  common spiritual DNA that we share it's a it's a gift friends in a day of ideological confusion
[3304.76 --> 3311.50]  progressivism and relativism we need now more than ever men who are proclaim biblical truth with
[3311.50 --> 3318.44]  conviction and boldness flowing out of a heart of love for Christ as 2nd Timothy 4 1 and 2 says in the
[3318.44 --> 3324.86]  presence of God and of Christ Jesus I give you this charge preach the word be prepared in season
[3324.86 --> 3331.44]  and out of season correct encourage rebuke with great patience and careful instructions be encouraged
[3331.44 --> 3334.06]  and be blessed today as you enter into ordination
[3334.06 --> 3338.14]  thank you
[3338.14 --> 3358.52]  please join us as we sing the song ancient of days
[3358.52 --> 3367.64]  yeah
[3367.64 --> 3377.42]  yeah
[3377.42 --> 3379.86]  yeah
[3379.86 --> 3381.84]  yeah
[3381.84 --> 3397.02]  He builds rise and fall. There is still one King reigning over all.
[3397.02 --> 3414.02]  So I will not fear, for this truth remains, that my God is the Ancient of Days.
[3414.02 --> 3432.02]  None above Him, none before Him, all the time in His hands, for His throne it shall remain and ever stand.
[3432.02 --> 3450.02]  All the power, all the glory, I will trust in His name, for my God is the Ancient of Days.
[3450.02 --> 3472.02]  O the dread of night overwhelms my soul. He is here with me, I am not alone.
[3472.02 --> 3490.02]  O His love is sure, and He knows my name, for my God is the Ancient of Days.
[3490.02 --> 3507.02]  None above Him, none before Him, all the time in His hands, for His throne it shall remain and ever stand.
[3507.02 --> 3524.02]  All the power, all the glory, I will trust in His name, for my God is the Ancient of Days.
[3524.02 --> 3541.02]  All the glory, all the glory, I will trust in His name, for my God is the Ancient of Days.
[3541.02 --> 3549.02]  Noah燈
[3549.02 --> 3550.02]  ji
[3550.02 --> 3552.02]  O hoes
[3552.02 --> 3561.70]  You may not see What the future brings
[3562.02 --> 3566.00]  I will watch and wait,
[3566.00 --> 3574.04]  For the Savior King, and my joy come free,
[3574.04 --> 3586.72]  standing face to face in the presence of the Ancient of Kings.
[3587.34 --> 3595.04]  None above Him, none before Him, all of time in His hands.
[3596.00 --> 3603.40]  For His rodents shall remain and ever stand.
[3604.12 --> 3612.90]  All the power, all the glory, I will trust in His name.
[3613.46 --> 3619.44]  For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[3619.44 --> 3628.84]  For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[3628.84 --> 3635.84]  For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[3635.84 --> 3643.24]  For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[3643.24 --> 3645.24]  For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[3645.24 --> 3649.24]  For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[3649.24 --> 3653.64]  Good evening.
[3653.64 --> 3654.64]  I'm Peter Van Heusen.
[3654.64 --> 3656.64]  I'm a member of this church.
[3656.64 --> 3659.64]  I've been here since 1995.
[3659.64 --> 3665.04]  And I remember 17 years ago, Kevin showed up here.
[3665.04 --> 3670.04]  He was just out of Redeemer, fresh out.
[3670.04 --> 3674.04]  And I remember looking him in the eye and I'm saying,
[3674.04 --> 3676.04]  you know what the stats are on people like you?
[3676.04 --> 3679.04]  They last...
[3679.04 --> 3686.04]  In our denomination, there was an article that wrote about how long youth pastors generally
[3686.04 --> 3687.44]  survived in a church.
[3687.44 --> 3688.44]  And it was three years.
[3688.44 --> 3693.44]  And I said, Kevin, you need to know that the stats are three years.
[3693.44 --> 3697.44]  And you said, you had this innocent look about you.
[3697.44 --> 3701.64]  And you said, yeah, I'll take it on even if it's three years.
[3701.64 --> 3703.64]  I think something to that effect.
[3703.64 --> 3707.64]  But look at here, 17 years later, and look what's happened.
[3707.64 --> 3711.64]  And Nikki, you know, you've been a big support to Kevin.
[3711.64 --> 3713.44]  And I know that in...
[3713.44 --> 3714.44]  When...
[3714.44 --> 3718.84]  For pastors, Jackie's dad was a pastor.
[3718.84 --> 3722.74]  So I know a little bit about what happens to pastor's families.
[3722.74 --> 3728.34]  And it can be an awesome job, but they're also difficult times.
[3728.34 --> 3735.64]  And I know it's very important that you have the support of Nikki and your three girls.
[3735.64 --> 3739.54]  I notice already at Sunday school, they're already active.
[3739.54 --> 3740.84]  It's awesome.
[3740.84 --> 3743.04]  But we give God the praise for you, Kevin.
[3743.04 --> 3745.44]  You know you're loved in this congregation.
[3745.44 --> 3748.64]  And yeah, we entrust you to God's care.
[3748.64 --> 3752.64]  And I'm going to leave the congregation in prayer.
[3752.64 --> 3757.24]  Thank you, Lord, on this day for your many blessings.
[3757.24 --> 3759.54]  Thank you for your church.
[3759.54 --> 3765.54]  Elect from every nation, yet one or all the earth.
[3765.54 --> 3772.14]  Thank you for giving your church the task of calling others to your saving grace in Jesus Christ.
[3772.14 --> 3775.74]  And to the fellowship of the covenant community.
[3775.74 --> 3782.64]  Today, we thank you in particular for giving the church the special office of the minister of the word.
[3782.64 --> 3788.64]  We rejoice that we as a congregation have received this new pastor to work among us.
[3788.64 --> 3794.54]  We pray that you will bless him as a servant of Christ and the church.
[3794.54 --> 3799.54]  Help him to be an inspired ambassador for his king.
[3799.54 --> 3804.54]  Bringing the message of salvation and reconciliation to us all.
[3804.54 --> 3814.44]  Bless him as a pastor and a counselor.
[3814.44 --> 3819.44]  May he prove himself a faithful steward in the household of God.
[3819.44 --> 3826.44]  Enable us as a congregation to listen gladly and attentively to him.
[3826.44 --> 3831.34]  Recognizing in his words the voice of the good shepherd.
[3831.34 --> 3840.84]  Strengthen us all in the work of the ministry so that we may be the salt of the earth and the light of the world.
[3840.84 --> 3849.44]  Help us, congregation and pastor, to endure the heat of the day and the darkness of the night.
[3849.44 --> 3853.34]  Sustain by your healing and guiding presence.
[3853.34 --> 3857.84]  As we come again to your word, open our ears to hear you.
[3857.84 --> 3860.14]  Open our minds to understand you.
[3860.14 --> 3864.14]  And open our lives to live for the glory of your name.
[3864.14 --> 3868.14]  All this we ask with thankful hearts.
[3868.14 --> 3872.14]  In the name of your dear son, our Lord and Savior.
[3872.14 --> 3873.14]  Amen.
[3879.44 --> 3902.94]  Sometimes, in moments like these, it's important to pause and reflect and remember.
[3902.94 --> 3911.14]  Because what we have just participated in together, and especially in the laying on of hands,
[3911.14 --> 3919.46]  the Church of Jesus Christ has done for 2,000 years to men and women called to serve in Jesus' name.
[3919.46 --> 3930.28]  The authority of God himself, of the calling and equipping of Jesus Christ, is passed in the laying on of hands.
[3930.28 --> 3938.48]  The authority of Jesus Christ is acknowledged in the elders of the Church surrounding the one who is called and placing their hands.
[3938.48 --> 3953.48]  Kevin, tonight, the calling of God in you has been confirmed and the work of God through you has been passed.
[3953.48 --> 3964.08]  In a long line of church history, from the apostles to the first generation of leaders and the second and the third,
[3964.08 --> 3967.18]  and however many it's been since then, you do the math.
[3968.48 --> 3969.92]  But God is still working.
[3970.98 --> 3972.02]  God is still active.
[3972.02 --> 3973.76]  God is still faithful to his church.
[3973.76 --> 3977.26]  And this is a mark of God's faithfulness.
[3978.76 --> 3981.50]  I remember my ordination.
[3981.50 --> 3983.96]  I remember that moment.
[3983.96 --> 3986.30]  I remember the sermon that was preached.
[3986.30 --> 3991.06]  I recall it almost weekly as I do this work.
[3992.84 --> 3997.98]  And so, much of what I say, Kevin, is going to be just for you.
[3998.76 --> 4004.38]  The other ministers of the Word here will resonate with a bunch of it, I am sure.
[4005.16 --> 4007.88]  The rest of you, I guess, like Steve said, can watch the fans.
[4007.88 --> 4012.34]  No, I'll turn to you as well.
[4016.34 --> 4028.46]  But we know that the authority of Jesus comes to those he calls first and foremost in the working of the Spirit and the application of the Word.
[4029.54 --> 4033.88]  And so we ground ourselves in God's Word tonight and in this moment.
[4033.88 --> 4042.60]  And to do that, I want to read with you a story from 1 Kings 22.
[4043.90 --> 4047.50]  A story about a prophet and a king.
[4047.94 --> 4051.40]  And so if you have a Bible, I encourage you, you can open it up, you can read along.
[4051.68 --> 4055.74]  It will be on the screen the first time through, but you may want to keep it in front of you.
[4056.46 --> 4058.80]  But here, for us, the Word of the Lord.
[4058.80 --> 4065.64]  For three years, there was no war between Aram and Israel.
[4066.66 --> 4075.50]  But in the third year of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, went down to see the king of Israel.
[4076.40 --> 4078.62]  The king of Israel had said to his officials,
[4079.48 --> 4087.22]  Don't you know that Ramoth-Gilead belongs to us, and yet we are doing nothing to retake it from the king of Aram?
[4087.22 --> 4090.58]  So he asked Jehoshaphat,
[4091.18 --> 4094.54]  Will you go with me to fight against Ramoth-Gilead?
[4096.16 --> 4098.58]  Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel,
[4099.14 --> 4104.24]  I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.
[4105.32 --> 4107.44]  But Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel,
[4107.86 --> 4111.06]  First, seek the counsel of the Lord.
[4111.06 --> 4118.44]  So the king of Israel brought together the prophets, about 400 men.
[4119.56 --> 4120.32]  And he asked them,
[4120.66 --> 4124.72]  Shall I go to war against Ramoth-Gilead, or shall I refrain?
[4125.78 --> 4130.56]  Go, they answered, for the Lord will give it into the king's hands.
[4132.20 --> 4133.48]  But Jehoshaphat asked,
[4134.06 --> 4138.66]  Is there no longer a prophet of the Lord here whom we can inquire of?
[4138.66 --> 4142.42]  The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat,
[4142.94 --> 4148.30]  There is still one prophet through whom we can inquire of the Lord,
[4148.74 --> 4153.76]  but I hate him, because he never prophesies anything good about me, and always bad.
[4156.12 --> 4158.64]  He is Micaiah, son of Imlah.
[4160.34 --> 4163.44]  Well, the king should not say such a thing, Jehoshaphat replied.
[4163.44 --> 4169.08]  So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said,
[4169.46 --> 4171.56]  Bring Micaiah, son of Imlah, at once.
[4173.74 --> 4175.88]  Dressed in their royal robes,
[4176.40 --> 4179.12]  the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, king of Judah,
[4179.46 --> 4182.00]  were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor
[4182.00 --> 4184.26]  by the entrance of the gate of Samaria,
[4184.74 --> 4187.52]  with all the prophets prophesying before them.
[4187.52 --> 4192.78]  Now Zedekiah, son of Canaanite, had made iron horns,
[4192.94 --> 4194.00]  and he declared,
[4194.40 --> 4195.90]  This is what the Lord says,
[4196.02 --> 4200.82]  With these you will gore the Arameans until they are destroyed.
[4201.70 --> 4204.88]  All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing.
[4205.20 --> 4208.42]  Attack Ramoth-Gilead and be victorious, they said,
[4208.56 --> 4211.14]  for the Lord will give it into the king's hand.
[4211.14 --> 4216.36]  The messenger, who had gone to summon Micaiah, said to him,
[4216.98 --> 4219.98]  Look, the other prophets, without exception,
[4220.22 --> 4221.98]  are predicting success for the king.
[4222.76 --> 4226.54]  Let your word agree with theirs and speak favorably.
[4228.42 --> 4229.92]  But Micaiah said,
[4230.92 --> 4233.02]  As surely as the Lord lives,
[4234.18 --> 4239.58]  I can tell him only what the Lord tells me.
[4241.14 --> 4242.10]  This is the word of the Lord.
[4246.44 --> 4253.02]  Now we live in an age of endless words.
[4254.56 --> 4256.90]  And if you are a regular worshiper here,
[4257.04 --> 4258.22]  you know that that's true.
[4260.16 --> 4262.98]  Everyone is saying something.
[4264.72 --> 4268.54]  Scroll long enough and you'll find a sermon for every desire.
[4268.74 --> 4270.62]  You'll find a gospel for every appetite.
[4271.14 --> 4275.46]  Some promise meaning through achievement,
[4275.76 --> 4278.22]  others through self-discovery or belonging.
[4278.64 --> 4281.08]  And in the midst of all of that noise,
[4281.62 --> 4285.04]  it becomes really hard to tell the difference
[4285.04 --> 4287.58]  between the truth and opinion.
[4288.44 --> 4290.04]  Between the word of God
[4290.04 --> 4293.52]  and the cacophony of this present moment.
[4293.52 --> 4296.44]  Now to be sure,
[4297.46 --> 4300.34]  the danger is not that God has stopped speaking,
[4301.04 --> 4305.16]  but that we have stopped wanting to hear him.
[4306.94 --> 4308.12]  Now this isn't new.
[4308.26 --> 4309.28]  In every generation,
[4309.64 --> 4311.58]  the people of God face the same temptation
[4311.58 --> 4315.14]  to prefer pleasant words over true ones,
[4315.30 --> 4318.34]  to gather prophets who say what we already believe.
[4318.34 --> 4321.86]  A great threat to the church has never been silence,
[4322.50 --> 4323.48]  but flattery.
[4324.80 --> 4328.64]  When prophets learn to say what the king wants to hear,
[4329.00 --> 4332.78]  when preachers learn to soothe rather than to speak,
[4333.16 --> 4335.98]  when congregations learn to crave comfort
[4335.98 --> 4337.98]  instead of craving the truth.
[4337.98 --> 4342.12]  But the word of God still lives.
[4343.00 --> 4344.82]  And the word of God, active as it is,
[4345.06 --> 4350.02]  still calls his servants to say only what he says
[4350.02 --> 4353.00]  and his people to love nothing less
[4353.00 --> 4355.48]  than the truth that God gives.
[4356.78 --> 4358.88]  That's what I hope that we can see tonight.
[4359.72 --> 4361.02]  First, Kevin, for you,
[4361.02 --> 4366.32]  God calls his ministers to speak only his word.
[4367.66 --> 4369.74]  And then second, for all of us, church,
[4370.10 --> 4373.08]  that God calls his people to want nothing less
[4373.08 --> 4375.36]  than that from their ministers
[4375.36 --> 4377.42]  and in your lives of faith.
[4379.40 --> 4381.54]  As we read the story,
[4381.74 --> 4383.92]  part of what we read is Jehoshaphat
[4383.92 --> 4385.98]  telling the king of Israel
[4385.98 --> 4388.66]  to seek the counsel of the Lord.
[4388.66 --> 4390.46]  And if you read it in your Bibles,
[4390.88 --> 4393.28]  if you read it in a similar translation to mine,
[4393.44 --> 4395.74]  you might have noticed that the word,
[4395.90 --> 4397.10]  that time it appears,
[4397.24 --> 4398.62]  is in small caps.
[4399.52 --> 4401.76]  That means it's the Hebrew word Yahweh.
[4403.02 --> 4403.86]  And then so Ahab,
[4404.12 --> 4406.68]  hearing the request of Jehoshaphat
[4406.68 --> 4408.02]  to seek the counsel of the Lord,
[4408.16 --> 4410.30]  Ahab, who's the king in Israel,
[4410.50 --> 4411.72]  grabs the prophets,
[4412.00 --> 4413.46]  about 400 of them,
[4413.70 --> 4415.16]  and they say,
[4415.66 --> 4417.16]  go for the Lord,
[4417.16 --> 4418.60]  and the Hebrew word there
[4418.60 --> 4420.66]  is in regular font.
[4421.56 --> 4422.34]  It's Adonai.
[4423.50 --> 4425.50]  Go for the Lord will give it to the king.
[4426.58 --> 4428.26]  I want to suggest this is already
[4428.26 --> 4430.30]  a textual hint
[4430.30 --> 4432.28]  to see what's going on
[4432.28 --> 4434.88]  and what's going to happen in this story.
[4436.28 --> 4439.16]  Now, I for one find it really interesting
[4439.16 --> 4446.38]  that when Jehoshaphat asks for a prophet,
[4446.60 --> 4446.98]  he says,
[4447.10 --> 4448.60]  is there not one of whom
[4448.60 --> 4450.88]  we can inquire of the Lord,
[4451.04 --> 4451.82]  of Yahweh?
[4452.18 --> 4454.18]  And Ahab, the king of Israel,
[4454.34 --> 4454.80]  responds,
[4454.96 --> 4455.26]  he says,
[4455.32 --> 4456.68]  well, there is one
[4456.68 --> 4459.90]  of whom we can inquire of the Lord.
[4460.36 --> 4461.32]  And I make this point
[4461.32 --> 4462.84]  because I think it's interesting
[4462.84 --> 4464.34]  that he knows
[4464.34 --> 4466.04]  his prophets
[4466.04 --> 4467.40]  are not
[4467.40 --> 4469.34]  inquiring of the Lord.
[4470.44 --> 4472.60]  He knows there is one who is,
[4473.08 --> 4474.14]  but the ones he likes
[4474.14 --> 4474.96]  are not.
[4476.96 --> 4478.50]  But if not of the Lord,
[4479.28 --> 4480.24]  then what?
[4481.24 --> 4481.96]  Or then who?
[4481.96 --> 4485.56]  Now, he also admits
[4485.56 --> 4487.72]  that he doesn't like Micaiah
[4487.72 --> 4490.04]  because Micaiah never says
[4490.04 --> 4491.80]  good things about the king.
[4491.92 --> 4493.64]  He never prophesies blessing
[4493.64 --> 4495.82]  or success or prosperity.
[4496.18 --> 4498.76]  And so, Ahab has surrounded himself
[4498.76 --> 4500.02]  with 400 prophets
[4500.02 --> 4502.24]  who tell him what he wants to hear
[4502.24 --> 4503.82]  and he's pushed away
[4503.82 --> 4505.56]  the one who tells him
[4505.56 --> 4506.54]  what the Lord says.
[4509.26 --> 4510.76]  But in comes Micaiah
[4510.76 --> 4512.16]  to this scene
[4512.16 --> 4513.06]  of great pomp
[4513.06 --> 4514.10]  and circumstance,
[4514.68 --> 4515.64]  the two kings
[4515.64 --> 4517.56]  are dressed in their royal robes.
[4517.68 --> 4519.00]  They're sitting on their thrones
[4519.00 --> 4520.52]  in front of the assembly
[4520.52 --> 4521.32]  of prophets
[4521.32 --> 4522.14]  who have gathered.
[4522.56 --> 4523.46]  One of the prophets
[4523.46 --> 4524.46]  even has props
[4524.46 --> 4525.76]  to make his point.
[4526.18 --> 4526.34]  Right?
[4526.40 --> 4527.54]  They're all saying things.
[4527.70 --> 4528.16]  Do it!
[4528.36 --> 4529.76]  The Lord has given it to you.
[4529.78 --> 4530.06]  And again,
[4530.12 --> 4531.22]  if you're looking in your Bibles,
[4532.30 --> 4533.08]  that word Lord
[4533.08 --> 4535.60]  is now in small caps.
[4538.50 --> 4539.44]  They've returned
[4539.44 --> 4541.66]  to using the word Lord
[4541.66 --> 4542.66]  or Yahweh
[4542.66 --> 4543.86]  in these messages.
[4544.00 --> 4544.30]  Now,
[4544.40 --> 4546.14]  they're using the right words
[4546.14 --> 4548.56]  even if they're giving
[4548.56 --> 4550.18]  a false message.
[4551.24 --> 4552.36]  They're using
[4552.36 --> 4552.84]  the shibboleths
[4552.84 --> 4554.80]  of a cultural moment,
[4555.14 --> 4556.12]  a dog whistle
[4556.12 --> 4556.78]  to maintain
[4556.78 --> 4557.90]  their influence
[4557.90 --> 4559.22]  and their power
[4559.22 --> 4560.36]  in front of the king.
[4560.36 --> 4564.14]  The servant,
[4564.56 --> 4565.24]  hearing all of this,
[4565.32 --> 4565.88]  seeing all this,
[4565.98 --> 4566.90]  turns to Micaiah
[4566.90 --> 4568.24]  whom he's ushered in
[4568.24 --> 4569.16]  and he says to them,
[4569.48 --> 4570.54]  say what they're saying.
[4571.30 --> 4572.48]  Speak favorably.
[4573.44 --> 4574.08]  In Hebrew,
[4574.24 --> 4574.40]  again,
[4574.46 --> 4575.08]  the word there
[4575.08 --> 4575.96]  is repeated.
[4576.50 --> 4576.82]  It says,
[4577.22 --> 4579.10]  they are predicting success.
[4579.22 --> 4579.44]  Literally,
[4579.60 --> 4579.82]  it says,
[4579.92 --> 4581.26]  they are saying good words.
[4581.64 --> 4582.84]  Your words should agree.
[4583.24 --> 4584.58]  Also predict success.
[4584.58 --> 4585.70]  Say good words.
[4585.70 --> 4590.70]  Can we just recognize
[4590.70 --> 4592.72]  that when you tell a prophet
[4592.72 --> 4593.70]  what to predict,
[4594.86 --> 4596.12]  they're no longer a prophet
[4596.12 --> 4598.02]  but a puppet.
[4600.10 --> 4601.54]  And this is the first point
[4601.54 --> 4602.94]  for tonight.
[4604.80 --> 4606.78]  There will always be
[4606.78 --> 4609.32]  an external temptation
[4609.32 --> 4612.04]  to say the kinds of things
[4612.04 --> 4613.72]  that people want to hear.
[4613.72 --> 4616.84]  This isn't unique to Israel.
[4618.14 --> 4619.68]  Paul says the same thing
[4619.68 --> 4620.22]  to Timothy
[4620.22 --> 4622.24]  in the early church.
[4622.32 --> 4623.34]  In his final charge,
[4623.40 --> 4623.96]  we've already read
[4623.96 --> 4624.82]  part of it tonight,
[4625.34 --> 4626.58]  Paul says to Timothy,
[4626.78 --> 4627.50]  preach the word,
[4627.66 --> 4628.26]  be prepared,
[4628.42 --> 4629.84]  in season and out of season,
[4630.00 --> 4630.40]  correct,
[4630.80 --> 4631.16]  rebuke,
[4631.28 --> 4631.74]  and encourage
[4631.74 --> 4633.02]  with great patience
[4633.02 --> 4634.48]  and careful instruction.
[4634.60 --> 4635.42]  But then he continues,
[4636.80 --> 4638.64]  for a time will come
[4638.64 --> 4641.02]  when people will not put up
[4641.02 --> 4642.16]  with sound doctrine,
[4642.16 --> 4644.14]  instead to suit
[4644.14 --> 4645.18]  their own desires,
[4645.54 --> 4646.76]  they will gather around them
[4646.76 --> 4648.00]  a great number of teachers
[4648.00 --> 4650.20]  to say what their itching ears
[4650.20 --> 4651.34]  want to hear.
[4653.84 --> 4655.14]  I believe now,
[4655.72 --> 4656.80]  more than ever,
[4657.46 --> 4659.02]  is that time.
[4660.70 --> 4661.58]  With social media,
[4662.00 --> 4662.68]  with YouTube,
[4663.04 --> 4663.94]  with Reddit forums
[4663.94 --> 4665.10]  and Discord groups,
[4665.10 --> 4666.84]  it is so easy
[4666.84 --> 4668.88]  to get our ears scratched.
[4670.26 --> 4671.62]  It is so easy
[4671.62 --> 4672.66]  to find messages
[4672.66 --> 4673.40]  that confirm
[4673.40 --> 4674.72]  what we already believe,
[4675.72 --> 4677.54]  to only be challenged
[4677.54 --> 4680.34]  to go into greater extremes
[4680.34 --> 4682.38]  of our particular perspectives,
[4682.94 --> 4685.22]  to only be challenged
[4685.22 --> 4686.94]  to affirm
[4686.94 --> 4689.22]  what we've already said.
[4689.22 --> 4690.62]  socially,
[4691.20 --> 4692.68]  like gathers unto like,
[4693.00 --> 4694.16]  and technologically,
[4694.72 --> 4695.66]  as algorithms
[4695.66 --> 4697.42]  remove contrasting choices
[4697.42 --> 4698.14]  and replace it
[4698.14 --> 4698.98]  with echo chambers,
[4699.30 --> 4700.32]  sometimes without even
[4700.32 --> 4701.34]  our knowing it's happening,
[4701.62 --> 4703.10]  we curate the messages
[4703.10 --> 4704.04]  we receive,
[4704.44 --> 4706.10]  and curating all of that,
[4706.18 --> 4706.96]  either on our own
[4706.96 --> 4708.34]  or on our behalf,
[4708.68 --> 4709.70]  ends up shaping
[4709.70 --> 4711.60]  our experience of reality,
[4711.86 --> 4713.04]  such that we don't see
[4713.04 --> 4714.42]  the same world anymore
[4714.42 --> 4715.42]  if we have different
[4715.42 --> 4716.36]  political opinions.
[4716.36 --> 4719.78]  which just drives us
[4719.78 --> 4720.42]  further down
[4720.42 --> 4721.26]  the rabbit hole
[4721.26 --> 4722.26]  of the wonderland
[4722.26 --> 4723.46]  of our own making
[4723.46 --> 4724.64]  and our prophets,
[4724.76 --> 4725.74]  our Cheshire cats
[4725.74 --> 4727.16]  created in our own image,
[4728.22 --> 4729.40]  caroling the same tune,
[4730.16 --> 4731.04]  always familiar,
[4731.88 --> 4732.60]  already queen
[4732.60 --> 4733.24]  in our hearts.
[4739.16 --> 4740.06]  But perhaps
[4740.06 --> 4741.16]  the greater temptation
[4741.16 --> 4746.50]  is the one
[4746.50 --> 4746.84]  in the heart
[4746.84 --> 4747.36]  of the preacher.
[4754.04 --> 4755.00]  I can tell them
[4755.00 --> 4755.98]  what they want to hear
[4755.98 --> 4758.10]  and they will like me.
[4760.70 --> 4761.80]  I know exactly
[4761.80 --> 4762.98]  what I have to do
[4762.98 --> 4764.44]  to exceed
[4764.44 --> 4765.44]  their expectations
[4765.44 --> 4766.76]  and to hit
[4766.76 --> 4767.62]  all the measures
[4767.62 --> 4768.56]  of success
[4768.56 --> 4769.54]  in the work
[4769.54 --> 4770.36]  that they've given me.
[4771.16 --> 4772.06]  and they will
[4772.06 --> 4772.98]  pay me for it.
[4778.60 --> 4779.74]  I have a penchant
[4779.74 --> 4780.44]  for the dramatic.
[4781.90 --> 4783.38]  I can make them cry,
[4784.42 --> 4785.82]  I can make them laugh,
[4786.40 --> 4788.28]  and I can make them feel
[4788.28 --> 4789.40]  like the Holy Spirit
[4789.40 --> 4790.34]  is in the room
[4790.34 --> 4792.70]  and they will love me
[4792.70 --> 4793.48]  for it.
[4793.48 --> 4799.04]  A careful person
[4799.04 --> 4800.00]  can stand here,
[4800.84 --> 4801.32]  week in
[4801.32 --> 4802.30]  and week out,
[4802.70 --> 4803.90]  and itch your ears.
[4805.90 --> 4807.14]  And you will thank God
[4807.14 --> 4807.50]  for them.
[4811.08 --> 4811.52]  Look,
[4812.30 --> 4813.22]  the other prophets
[4813.22 --> 4814.08]  without exception
[4814.08 --> 4815.32]  are predicting success.
[4816.76 --> 4818.10]  They make me feel good.
[4818.70 --> 4819.58]  He makes me laugh.
[4819.64 --> 4820.58]  He keeps my attention.
[4820.58 --> 4822.16]  The fans are doing alright.
[4823.98 --> 4824.82]  Let your word
[4824.82 --> 4826.24]  agree with theirs.
[4827.12 --> 4828.46]  Predict my success.
[4829.08 --> 4830.22]  Scratch my ears.
[4834.12 --> 4835.28]  And so what are we to do?
[4838.28 --> 4839.32]  Verse 14,
[4839.32 --> 4842.74]  but Micaiah said,
[4844.22 --> 4844.82]  as surely
[4844.82 --> 4846.54]  as the Lord
[4846.54 --> 4847.98]  lives,
[4848.76 --> 4850.20]  I can tell him
[4850.20 --> 4850.78]  only
[4850.78 --> 4851.84]  what the Lord
[4851.84 --> 4853.78]  tells me.
[4855.92 --> 4857.32]  Preach the word.
[4858.32 --> 4858.96]  Correct.
[4859.64 --> 4860.24]  Rebuke.
[4860.76 --> 4861.36]  Encourage.
[4861.36 --> 4863.88]  It's interesting to me
[4863.88 --> 4864.48]  that Paul
[4864.48 --> 4865.46]  in that text
[4865.46 --> 4866.20]  to Timothy
[4866.20 --> 4867.58]  contrasts
[4867.58 --> 4868.52]  things that
[4868.52 --> 4869.78]  itch people's ears
[4869.78 --> 4871.44]  with sound doctrine.
[4872.58 --> 4873.90]  Paul contradicts
[4873.90 --> 4874.62]  itching ears
[4874.62 --> 4875.88]  with sound doctrine
[4875.88 --> 4876.82]  and the phrase there,
[4876.96 --> 4877.64]  sound doctrine,
[4877.88 --> 4878.70]  literally means
[4878.70 --> 4879.90]  healthy teaching.
[4880.90 --> 4882.46]  It's the kind of truth
[4882.46 --> 4883.84]  that nourishes the soul,
[4884.42 --> 4886.10]  that strengthens the church,
[4886.36 --> 4887.62]  and that keeps faith alive.
[4887.62 --> 4890.28]  But just like medicine,
[4891.08 --> 4891.84]  healthy teaching
[4891.84 --> 4893.04]  isn't always pleasant.
[4894.04 --> 4894.96]  It doesn't always
[4894.96 --> 4896.42]  go down easy.
[4897.84 --> 4898.58]  But that's why
[4898.58 --> 4899.34]  Micaiah's words
[4899.34 --> 4900.38]  matter so much.
[4901.18 --> 4901.78]  As surely
[4901.78 --> 4902.82]  as the Lord lives,
[4902.88 --> 4903.84]  I can only tell him
[4903.84 --> 4904.32]  what the Lord
[4904.32 --> 4904.92]  tells me.
[4905.20 --> 4906.52]  To be a faithful preacher
[4906.52 --> 4907.28]  means
[4907.28 --> 4908.62]  you do not
[4908.62 --> 4909.54]  edit God.
[4911.56 --> 4912.52]  You do not
[4912.52 --> 4913.02]  sand down
[4913.02 --> 4913.74]  the rough edges
[4913.74 --> 4914.70]  of his word
[4914.70 --> 4916.20]  to make it fit
[4916.20 --> 4917.42]  our modern sensibilities.
[4918.24 --> 4919.18]  You do not trade
[4919.18 --> 4919.74]  the language
[4919.74 --> 4920.96]  of sin and grace
[4920.96 --> 4922.16]  for the softer tones
[4922.16 --> 4923.56]  of self-help.
[4923.82 --> 4924.92]  You do not hide
[4924.92 --> 4925.58]  the scandal
[4925.58 --> 4926.28]  of the cross
[4926.28 --> 4927.86]  behind the polish
[4927.86 --> 4928.70]  of relevance.
[4931.40 --> 4932.40]  One of the
[4932.40 --> 4933.34]  Bible translations
[4933.34 --> 4935.02]  that I like
[4935.02 --> 4935.56]  translates
[4935.56 --> 4936.94]  that Greek idiom
[4936.94 --> 4937.88]  itching ears
[4937.88 --> 4939.00]  as
[4939.00 --> 4939.86]  they have
[4939.86 --> 4940.92]  an insatiable
[4940.92 --> 4941.72]  curiosity
[4941.72 --> 4942.52]  to hear
[4942.52 --> 4943.52]  new things.
[4945.24 --> 4946.06]  So the contrast
[4946.06 --> 4946.96]  is between
[4946.96 --> 4948.32]  new things
[4948.32 --> 4949.42]  and sound
[4949.42 --> 4950.20]  doctrine.
[4951.74 --> 4952.72]  The moment
[4952.72 --> 4953.44]  we soften
[4953.44 --> 4954.06]  the doctrines
[4954.06 --> 4954.82]  of our faith
[4954.82 --> 4956.12]  for new things,
[4956.48 --> 4956.62]  right,
[4956.68 --> 4957.88]  when the holiness
[4957.88 --> 4958.52]  of God
[4958.52 --> 4959.12]  is replaced
[4959.12 --> 4959.84]  with the happiness
[4959.84 --> 4960.54]  of people,
[4960.74 --> 4961.60]  when the sinfulness
[4961.60 --> 4962.36]  of humanity
[4962.36 --> 4963.08]  is replaced
[4963.08 --> 4964.08]  with the self-esteem
[4964.08 --> 4964.90]  of the individual,
[4965.30 --> 4966.38]  when the exclusivity
[4966.38 --> 4966.96]  of Christ
[4966.96 --> 4967.52]  is replaced
[4967.52 --> 4968.18]  with the value
[4968.18 --> 4968.76]  of tolerance,
[4969.12 --> 4969.82]  when the necessity
[4969.82 --> 4970.52]  of redemption
[4970.52 --> 4971.32]  is replaced
[4971.32 --> 4972.18]  with the celebration
[4972.18 --> 4973.04]  of vice,
[4973.04 --> 4974.40]  when the authority
[4974.40 --> 4975.12]  of Scripture
[4975.12 --> 4975.84]  is replaced
[4975.84 --> 4976.64]  with the autonomy
[4976.64 --> 4977.40]  of self,
[4977.60 --> 4978.50]  we have ceased
[4978.50 --> 4980.08]  to speak from God
[4980.08 --> 4981.36]  and we have begun
[4981.36 --> 4982.58]  speaking in place
[4982.58 --> 4983.22]  of God.
[4985.88 --> 4987.36]  Sound doctrine
[4987.36 --> 4989.28]  is not
[4989.28 --> 4990.82]  called dogma.
[4991.98 --> 4992.70]  Sound doctrine
[4992.70 --> 4994.18]  is the living truth
[4994.18 --> 4995.66]  about a living God,
[4995.86 --> 4997.00]  a truth that heals
[4997.00 --> 4998.10]  and restores
[4998.10 --> 4999.16]  and corrects
[4999.16 --> 5000.72]  and brings to life
[5000.72 --> 5002.22]  the people of God.
[5004.44 --> 5005.16]  That's why
[5005.16 --> 5005.78]  the preacher
[5005.78 --> 5007.24]  must say
[5007.24 --> 5008.24]  what the Lord
[5008.24 --> 5009.18]  says.
[5011.82 --> 5013.12]  Because God's people
[5013.12 --> 5015.74]  cannot live
[5015.74 --> 5017.20]  on opinions.
[5018.68 --> 5019.20]  God's people
[5019.20 --> 5020.04]  cannot survive
[5020.04 --> 5021.02]  on entertainment
[5021.02 --> 5022.84]  or on positive thinking.
[5023.32 --> 5024.12]  We live
[5024.12 --> 5025.36]  on every word
[5025.36 --> 5025.96]  that comes
[5025.96 --> 5026.64]  from the mouth
[5026.64 --> 5027.64]  of the Lord.
[5030.72 --> 5031.88]  But again,
[5032.96 --> 5033.80]  sound doctrine
[5033.80 --> 5035.08]  is never
[5035.08 --> 5036.10]  just a set
[5036.10 --> 5037.32]  of right ideas.
[5037.56 --> 5038.32]  It's not merely
[5038.32 --> 5039.58]  believing the correct
[5039.58 --> 5040.66]  things about God.
[5040.80 --> 5041.96]  It is belonging
[5041.96 --> 5043.02]  to the living God
[5043.02 --> 5043.50]  himself.
[5045.52 --> 5046.48]  True doctrine
[5046.48 --> 5048.28]  always leads
[5048.28 --> 5049.94]  to lived
[5049.94 --> 5050.94]  discipleship.
[5053.00 --> 5054.42]  Because at the
[5054.42 --> 5055.22]  center of
[5055.22 --> 5056.44]  our doctrine
[5056.44 --> 5058.32]  is not a system
[5058.32 --> 5060.00]  but a savior.
[5060.72 --> 5062.70]  the word
[5062.70 --> 5063.48]  we preach
[5063.48 --> 5064.56]  is not abstract.
[5065.62 --> 5066.58]  It is incarnate.
[5067.78 --> 5068.18]  Truth
[5068.18 --> 5069.10]  has a name
[5069.10 --> 5070.02]  and a face
[5070.02 --> 5071.04]  and we call him
[5071.04 --> 5071.96]  Jesus Christ.
[5072.20 --> 5072.80]  The word
[5072.80 --> 5073.88]  made flesh.
[5075.26 --> 5076.06]  There's an
[5076.06 --> 5077.10]  incredible story
[5077.10 --> 5077.66]  of Jesus
[5077.66 --> 5079.72]  who had just
[5079.72 --> 5081.10]  spent some time
[5081.10 --> 5082.50]  teaching his followers
[5082.50 --> 5084.14]  a really hard truth.
[5084.26 --> 5084.88]  He told them
[5084.88 --> 5085.90]  unless you eat
[5085.90 --> 5086.66]  my flesh
[5086.66 --> 5087.58]  and drink my blood
[5087.58 --> 5088.30]  you cannot enter
[5088.30 --> 5088.70]  the kingdom
[5088.70 --> 5089.54]  of heaven
[5089.54 --> 5090.16]  and they're like
[5090.16 --> 5091.34]  whoa this is weird.
[5092.14 --> 5092.94]  I'm out.
[5093.62 --> 5094.46]  And they left.
[5094.90 --> 5095.62]  They ran away
[5095.62 --> 5096.46]  and Jesus turns
[5096.46 --> 5097.24]  to his disciples
[5097.24 --> 5098.04]  and he says
[5098.04 --> 5099.42]  will you
[5099.42 --> 5100.82]  run away too?
[5101.96 --> 5102.90]  Do you also
[5102.90 --> 5103.60]  want to leave?
[5104.60 --> 5105.28]  And Peter says
[5105.28 --> 5105.64]  to him
[5105.64 --> 5106.72]  Lord
[5106.72 --> 5108.10]  to whom
[5108.10 --> 5108.92]  shall we go?
[5109.60 --> 5110.24]  For you
[5110.24 --> 5111.48]  have the words
[5111.48 --> 5112.38]  of eternal
[5112.38 --> 5113.46]  life.
[5114.66 --> 5115.58]  To whom
[5115.58 --> 5116.46]  shall we go?
[5116.46 --> 5118.00]  for you
[5118.00 --> 5118.80]  have the words
[5118.80 --> 5119.96]  of eternal life.
[5120.04 --> 5120.86]  Peter understood
[5120.86 --> 5121.98]  that truth
[5121.98 --> 5122.98]  isn't just about
[5122.98 --> 5124.18]  what Jesus says
[5124.18 --> 5124.94]  it's about
[5124.94 --> 5125.70]  who Jesus
[5125.70 --> 5126.28]  is
[5126.28 --> 5128.26]  and his words
[5128.26 --> 5128.94]  give life
[5128.94 --> 5129.76]  because he
[5129.76 --> 5131.00]  is life.
[5132.64 --> 5133.14]  And to cling
[5133.14 --> 5134.10]  to sound doctrine
[5134.10 --> 5134.98]  then is to cling
[5134.98 --> 5135.70]  to Christ
[5135.70 --> 5137.56]  and none other.
[5138.42 --> 5139.16]  To preach
[5139.16 --> 5139.84]  sound doctrine
[5139.84 --> 5140.76]  is to call people
[5140.76 --> 5141.64]  into relationship
[5141.64 --> 5142.64]  with the living
[5142.64 --> 5143.34]  word
[5143.34 --> 5144.98]  whose words
[5144.98 --> 5145.96]  both wound
[5145.96 --> 5146.98]  and heal
[5146.98 --> 5148.42]  convict
[5148.42 --> 5149.68]  and comfort
[5149.68 --> 5151.04]  both slay
[5151.04 --> 5152.44]  and make alive.
[5154.04 --> 5154.82]  That's why
[5154.82 --> 5155.34]  we dare not
[5155.34 --> 5156.48]  soften what he says.
[5156.84 --> 5157.78]  His hard words
[5157.78 --> 5159.08]  are merciful words
[5159.08 --> 5160.26]  because they lead
[5160.26 --> 5161.22]  to eternal life.
[5162.58 --> 5163.44]  The preacher's task
[5163.44 --> 5164.44]  is not to make
[5164.44 --> 5165.32]  that truth
[5165.32 --> 5166.10]  easier
[5166.10 --> 5166.94]  but to make it
[5166.94 --> 5167.48]  heard.
[5168.52 --> 5169.12]  To proclaim
[5169.12 --> 5169.64]  Christ
[5169.64 --> 5170.34]  until hearts
[5170.34 --> 5170.76]  burn
[5170.76 --> 5171.92]  and the disciples
[5171.92 --> 5173.06]  say again
[5173.06 --> 5173.42]  Lord
[5173.42 --> 5173.96]  to whom
[5173.96 --> 5174.80]  shall we go?
[5177.14 --> 5178.24]  Or as you have
[5178.24 --> 5179.86]  said and heard
[5179.86 --> 5180.70]  from people
[5180.70 --> 5181.42]  wiser than me
[5181.42 --> 5182.54]  preach grace
[5182.54 --> 5183.34]  until they get it.
[5185.82 --> 5186.90]  The true prophet
[5186.90 --> 5187.92]  not only says
[5187.92 --> 5189.68]  but shows.
[5191.18 --> 5192.18]  The preacher's task
[5192.18 --> 5192.56]  then
[5192.56 --> 5193.28]  is to make
[5193.28 --> 5193.78]  the truth
[5193.78 --> 5194.70]  of God's word
[5194.70 --> 5195.86]  and the transformation
[5195.86 --> 5197.08]  that comes from it
[5197.08 --> 5198.00]  visible.
[5200.74 --> 5201.58]  John Owen
[5201.58 --> 5202.62]  is a
[5202.62 --> 5204.82]  17th century
[5204.82 --> 5205.72]  pastor
[5205.72 --> 5207.70]  and he says
[5207.70 --> 5208.98]  that the pastor's
[5208.98 --> 5209.46]  life
[5209.46 --> 5210.38]  should be
[5210.38 --> 5210.98]  vocal.
[5212.16 --> 5212.58]  Sermons
[5212.58 --> 5213.30]  must be
[5213.30 --> 5214.02]  practiced
[5214.02 --> 5215.24]  as well as
[5215.24 --> 5215.60]  preached.
[5219.04 --> 5220.16]  Now lastly
[5220.16 --> 5222.34]  and I'll bring us
[5222.34 --> 5222.92]  to a close
[5222.92 --> 5223.40]  with this.
[5224.48 --> 5225.14]  What about us?
[5226.14 --> 5226.94]  What about you?
[5227.62 --> 5228.26]  The people
[5228.26 --> 5228.94]  who listen
[5228.94 --> 5229.62]  week in
[5229.62 --> 5230.10]  and week out
[5230.10 --> 5230.64]  who gather
[5230.64 --> 5231.92]  under the word.
[5233.30 --> 5234.58]  If Micaiah's
[5234.58 --> 5235.24]  courage
[5235.24 --> 5236.10]  speaks to the
[5236.10 --> 5236.48]  preacher
[5236.48 --> 5238.10]  it also
[5238.10 --> 5238.74]  speaks to the
[5238.74 --> 5239.12]  people.
[5240.86 --> 5242.08]  Every church
[5242.08 --> 5243.58]  shapes its own
[5243.58 --> 5244.40]  prophets.
[5245.68 --> 5246.50]  Congregations
[5246.50 --> 5247.06]  gather
[5247.06 --> 5247.96]  teachers
[5247.96 --> 5249.22]  to scratch
[5249.22 --> 5250.22]  their ears
[5250.22 --> 5251.42]  or
[5251.42 --> 5253.52]  in hunger
[5253.52 --> 5255.04]  for the truth
[5255.04 --> 5255.84]  of God
[5255.84 --> 5257.06]  however hard
[5257.06 --> 5258.12]  it may be.
[5260.62 --> 5261.02]  And the
[5261.02 --> 5261.48]  health
[5261.48 --> 5262.34]  of the
[5262.34 --> 5262.84]  pulpit
[5262.84 --> 5263.72]  directly
[5263.72 --> 5264.50]  corresponds
[5264.50 --> 5265.58]  to the
[5265.58 --> 5266.00]  hunger
[5266.00 --> 5266.96]  in the
[5266.96 --> 5267.22]  pew.
[5268.58 --> 5269.52]  So let me
[5269.52 --> 5269.88]  ask
[5269.88 --> 5272.20]  only if it
[5272.20 --> 5273.02]  makes us
[5273.02 --> 5273.94]  feel good
[5273.94 --> 5274.68]  or
[5274.68 --> 5275.60]  do we
[5275.60 --> 5275.98]  come to
[5275.98 --> 5276.32]  worship
[5276.32 --> 5277.20]  expecting
[5277.20 --> 5277.96]  a good
[5277.96 --> 5278.60]  and service
[5278.60 --> 5279.42]  to consume
[5279.42 --> 5280.36]  or
[5280.36 --> 5280.84]  do we
[5280.84 --> 5281.20]  come
[5281.20 --> 5281.86]  expecting
[5281.86 --> 5282.86]  that here
[5282.86 --> 5283.28]  in this
[5283.28 --> 5283.60]  moment
[5283.60 --> 5283.98]  and in
[5283.98 --> 5284.50]  these words
[5284.50 --> 5285.16]  we will
[5285.16 --> 5285.86]  meet the
[5285.86 --> 5286.20]  living
[5286.20 --> 5286.66]  Jesus
[5286.66 --> 5288.42]  and that
[5288.42 --> 5289.04]  his word
[5289.04 --> 5289.80]  will speak
[5289.80 --> 5290.66]  directly to
[5290.66 --> 5291.26]  our hearts
[5291.26 --> 5292.90]  and transform
[5292.90 --> 5293.58]  our lives.
[5295.82 --> 5296.66]  And so for
[5296.66 --> 5296.96]  all of you
[5296.96 --> 5297.80]  pray for us
[5297.80 --> 5298.72]  pray for your
[5298.72 --> 5299.12]  pastors
[5299.12 --> 5300.10]  pray for the
[5300.10 --> 5300.54]  people who
[5300.54 --> 5301.38]  stand up
[5301.38 --> 5301.66]  here
[5301.66 --> 5302.54]  that we
[5302.54 --> 5302.90]  would have
[5302.90 --> 5303.44]  the courage
[5303.44 --> 5304.54]  to speak
[5304.54 --> 5305.00]  what the
[5305.00 --> 5305.70]  Lord says
[5305.70 --> 5306.34]  no matter
[5306.34 --> 5306.74]  what
[5306.74 --> 5308.64]  and to
[5308.64 --> 5310.34]  study the
[5310.34 --> 5310.66]  word
[5310.66 --> 5311.36]  yourselves
[5311.36 --> 5312.56]  so that
[5312.56 --> 5313.28]  you can
[5313.28 --> 5313.72]  test
[5313.72 --> 5314.40]  everything
[5314.40 --> 5314.88]  that is
[5314.88 --> 5315.10]  said
[5315.10 --> 5315.78]  from up
[5315.78 --> 5315.96]  here
[5315.96 --> 5316.32]  so that
[5316.32 --> 5316.84]  you can
[5316.84 --> 5317.36]  hold us
[5317.36 --> 5317.92]  accountable
[5317.92 --> 5318.68]  to the
[5318.68 --> 5319.00]  word
[5319.00 --> 5319.72]  of God.
[5321.06 --> 5321.86]  Encourage
[5321.86 --> 5323.18]  faithfulness
[5323.18 --> 5323.92]  in your
[5323.92 --> 5324.44]  pastors
[5324.44 --> 5325.58]  more than
[5325.58 --> 5326.56]  eloquence.
[5326.72 --> 5327.10]  Encourage
[5327.10 --> 5327.60]  depth
[5327.60 --> 5328.44]  more than
[5328.44 --> 5329.12]  novelty
[5329.12 --> 5330.00]  obedience
[5330.00 --> 5331.34]  more than
[5331.34 --> 5332.46]  entertainment.
[5332.46 --> 5335.56]  And when
[5335.56 --> 5335.94]  the word
[5335.94 --> 5336.38]  of God
[5336.38 --> 5337.32]  cuts you
[5337.32 --> 5338.06]  to the
[5338.06 --> 5338.36]  quick
[5338.36 --> 5340.52]  don't run
[5340.52 --> 5341.04]  from it
[5341.04 --> 5342.56]  but let
[5342.56 --> 5343.00]  it heal
[5343.00 --> 5343.36]  you

[5344.76 --> 5345.28]  restore
[5345.28 --> 5345.68]  you
[5345.68 --> 5346.76]  let it
[5346.76 --> 5347.54]  fill your
[5347.54 --> 5347.96]  heart
[5347.96 --> 5348.64]  and your
[5348.64 --> 5349.10]  life
[5349.10 --> 5350.78]  because those
[5350.78 --> 5351.54]  who hunger
[5351.54 --> 5352.30]  for the
[5352.30 --> 5352.86]  truth
[5352.86 --> 5353.50]  will be
[5353.50 --> 5354.00]  filled
[5354.00 --> 5354.84]  with
[5354.84 --> 5355.74]  life.
[5357.00 --> 5357.22]  And a
[5357.22 --> 5357.68]  church
[5357.68 --> 5359.48]  that wants
[5359.48 --> 5360.00]  the word
[5360.00 --> 5360.58]  of God
[5360.58 --> 5361.42]  will hear
[5361.42 --> 5362.10]  the voice
[5362.10 --> 5362.88]  of the
[5362.88 --> 5363.18]  Lord.
[5363.82 --> 5364.16]  Jesus
[5364.16 --> 5365.40]  has the
[5365.40 --> 5365.82]  words
[5365.82 --> 5366.48]  and is
[5366.48 --> 5367.12]  the word
[5367.12 --> 5367.72]  of
[5367.72 --> 5368.34]  eternal
[5368.34 --> 5369.56]  life.
[5371.56 --> 5372.34]  And in
[5372.34 --> 5372.88]  his name
[5372.88 --> 5374.08]  all God's
[5374.08 --> 5374.60]  people said
[5374.60 --> 5375.72]  amen.

[5377.36 --> 5377.54]  me.
[5384.98 --> 5385.58]  Holy
[5385.58 --> 5386.82]  God

[5394.00 --> 5394.18]  might
[5394.18 --> 5394.78]  transform
[5394.78 --> 5395.12]  our

[5566.36 --> 5574.32]  Thou in me dwelling, and I with thee one.

[5650.04 --> 5671.72]  What a night.
[5671.72 --> 5675.86]  Thank you all for being here tonight.
[5676.24 --> 5677.00]  This is on, right?
[5677.14 --> 5677.60]  Did I turn it on?
[5677.74 --> 5678.52]  No, did I turn it on?
[5678.66 --> 5679.54]  Did I turn it on now?
[5679.66 --> 5680.28]  There it is.
[5681.24 --> 5682.66]  Thank you all for being here tonight.
[5682.94 --> 5687.14]  What an honor it is to be able to be in this moment right now,
[5687.18 --> 5688.50]  and to be amongst all of you all.
[5688.50 --> 5689.90]  I am so, so grateful.
[5690.46 --> 5694.56]  I was told this is the right time for me to give a bunch of thank yous,
[5694.66 --> 5696.32]  so just bear with me for a minute.
[5697.26 --> 5700.46]  I want to thank my family for, I want to thank Nikki and my girls.
[5700.46 --> 5702.90]  They have been very patient with me,
[5703.16 --> 5706.70]  especially for the last seven years as I've gone through this education process
[5706.70 --> 5709.96]  and haven't always been the pinnacle of patience myself,
[5710.22 --> 5712.86]  and so I'm so grateful for them, for their love, for their support,
[5712.98 --> 5715.12]  and for them being with me through this.
[5715.16 --> 5716.50]  And thank you for my family as well.
[5716.60 --> 5718.40]  They came all the way from Edmonton to be here tonight.
[5718.78 --> 5722.24]  They have also been a huge encouragement to me as well.
[5722.84 --> 5728.10]  I want to thank the staff here for Chris and for Josh for always being present
[5728.10 --> 5732.48]  and be able to wrestle through what it means to be a minister,
[5732.68 --> 5737.74]  to be a pastor, to be someone who works in this church
[5737.74 --> 5740.14]  and does this calling of God in this way.
[5740.22 --> 5743.94]  So thank you to you both and to Maria and Marilyn and Basma as well
[5743.94 --> 5749.48]  for the whole staff who is there have supported me this whole process too.
[5749.96 --> 5751.08]  As well as former staff.
[5751.30 --> 5752.28]  I see Elsa in the back.
[5752.56 --> 5754.32]  Elsa was one of the first people to tell me,
[5754.32 --> 5756.52]  you should really go to get your MDiv.
[5756.60 --> 5758.68]  She told me that very, very, very early on,
[5758.70 --> 5760.12]  and I said, no.
[5761.02 --> 5761.94]  And here we are.
[5762.14 --> 5764.96]  So I've worked with many pastors over the years
[5764.96 --> 5766.98]  and many staff as well, and I'm grateful for all of you.
[5767.68 --> 5768.28]  Friends too.
[5768.36 --> 5769.46]  I see friends have come out here.
[5769.52 --> 5771.72]  They've always been encouraging and supporting me in this too,
[5772.10 --> 5773.22]  and I know I can go to them.
[5773.62 --> 5774.80]  So many pastors are here.
[5774.96 --> 5776.70]  Colleagues of mine, you saw lots of them.
[5776.74 --> 5777.52]  They prayed too.
[5777.92 --> 5778.86]  They're sitting amongst.
[5780.50 --> 5781.92]  We have a really good classes.
[5781.92 --> 5784.96]  We have a lot of good pastors here in BC Southeast,
[5785.76 --> 5790.30]  and it is a joy to have served with them for so long as well.
[5791.36 --> 5792.46]  And so I thank you for that.
[5792.56 --> 5795.36]  I thank you for your love and your support and for your camaraderie
[5795.36 --> 5798.12]  and to be able to laugh and cry and pray together.
[5798.42 --> 5799.42]  It's a blessing too.
[5800.18 --> 5802.54]  And finally, I want to thank the church.
[5803.62 --> 5806.12]  Elsa said it years and years ago, 16 years ago,
[5806.42 --> 5809.92]  I wouldn't be here today if a good handful of you
[5809.92 --> 5812.24]  didn't come up and tap me on the shoulder and say,
[5812.36 --> 5814.18]  Kevin, go and do this.
[5814.68 --> 5816.66]  I ignored a lot of you for a long time,
[5816.70 --> 5819.78]  and then finally I started listening to God speak through you
[5819.78 --> 5821.30]  and encouraged me to do this.
[5821.44 --> 5824.22]  And so the body of Christ here at Emmanuel
[5824.22 --> 5828.22]  is a huge reason why we have a day and a service
[5828.22 --> 5829.30]  and this moment like this.
[5829.38 --> 5831.74]  And so thank you for, again, your love, your encouragement,
[5831.92 --> 5832.42]  your support.
[5832.52 --> 5834.72]  This church has taken care of me for a long time,
[5834.72 --> 5836.82]  and I hope it continues to do so
[5836.82 --> 5840.44]  as I do my best to love and care for you as well.
[5842.04 --> 5845.60]  Now, it is my privilege to lead you
[5845.60 --> 5847.92]  in God's blessing here tonight.
[5848.00 --> 5850.82]  So please open your arms and receive this blessing.
[5851.58 --> 5854.18]  The Lord bless you and keep you.
[5854.68 --> 5856.86]  The Lord make his face shine upon you
[5856.86 --> 5858.08]  and be gracious to you.
[5858.66 --> 5860.56]  The Lord turn his face toward you
[5860.56 --> 5862.04]  and give you his peace.
