[0.00 --> 2.00]  Woah!
[6.12 --> 8.44]  Oh, thank you so much.
[8.54 --> 11.54]  I'd like to see you in the next video.
[11.66 --> 15.50]  Simon Prince, Wow!
[17.46 --> 20.00]  Massage!
[20.00 --> 22.46]  Yeah!
[22.46 --> 24.92]  That was done!
[24.92 --> 54.90]  Thank you.
[54.92 --> 84.90]  Thank you.
[84.92 --> 114.90]  Thank you.
[114.92 --> 144.90]  Thank you.
[144.92 --> 174.90]  Thank you.
[174.92 --> 204.90]  Thank you.
[204.92 --> 234.90]  Thank you.
[234.92 --> 264.90]  Thank you.
[264.92 --> 294.90]  Thank you.
[294.92 --> 324.90]  Thank you.
[324.92 --> 354.90]  Thank you.
[354.92 --> 384.90]  Thank you.
[384.90 --> 414.88]  Thank you.
[414.90 --> 444.88]  Thank you.
[444.88 --> 474.86]  Thank you.
[474.88 --> 504.86]  Thank you.
[504.88 --> 534.86]  Thank you.
[534.86 --> 564.84]  Thank you.
[564.88 --> 594.84]  Thank you.
[594.84 --> 624.82]  Thank you.
[624.84 --> 654.82]  Thank you.
[654.84 --> 656.84]  Thank you.
[684.84 --> 714.82]  Thank you.
[714.82 --> 744.80]  Thank you.
[744.80 --> 774.78]  Thank you.
[774.78 --> 804.76]  Thank you.
[804.78 --> 834.76]  Thank you.
[834.78 --> 864.76]  Thank you.
[864.78 --> 894.76]  Thank you.
[894.78 --> 924.76]  Thank you.
[924.78 --> 954.76]  Thank you.
[954.78 --> 984.76]  Thank you.
[984.78 --> 1014.76]  Thank you.
[1014.78 --> 1044.76]  Thank you.
[1044.76 --> 1044.78]  Thank you.
[1074.76 --> 1104.74]  Thank you.
[1104.76 --> 1134.74]  Thank you.
[1134.76 --> 1164.74]  Thank you.
[1164.76 --> 1194.74]  Thank you.
[1194.76 --> 1224.74]  Thank you.
[1224.76 --> 1254.74]  Thank you.
[1254.74 --> 1284.72]  Thank you.
[1284.74 --> 1314.72]  Thank you.
[1314.74 --> 1344.72]  Thank you.
[1344.74 --> 1374.72]  Thank you.
[1374.74 --> 1404.72]  Thank you.
[1404.74 --> 1434.72]  Thank you.
[1434.74 --> 1464.72]  Thank you.
[1464.74 --> 1494.72]  Thank you.
[1494.74 --> 1524.74]  Thank you.
[1524.74 --> 1554.72]  Thank you.
[1554.74 --> 1584.72]  Thank you.
[1584.74 --> 1614.72]  Thank you.
[1614.74 --> 1644.72]  Thank you.
[1644.72 --> 1674.72]  Thank you.
[1674.72 --> 1704.70]  Thank you.
[1704.72 --> 1734.70]  Thank you.
[1734.70 --> 1764.70]  Thank you.
[1764.70 --> 1794.68]  Thank you.
[1794.68 --> 1824.66]  Thank you.
[1824.68 --> 1854.66]  Thank you.
[1854.66 --> 1884.66]  Thank you.
[1884.66 --> 1914.66]  Thank you.
[1914.66 --> 1944.64]  Thank you.
[1944.64 --> 1974.64]  Thank you.
[1974.64 --> 2004.64]  Thank you.
[2004.64 --> 2034.62]  Thank you.
[2034.64 --> 2064.62]  Thank you.
[2064.64 --> 2094.62]  Thank you.
[2094.64 --> 2124.62]  Thank you.
[2124.64 --> 2154.62]  Thank you.
[2154.64 --> 2184.62]  Thank you.
[2184.64 --> 2214.62]  Thank you.
[2214.62 --> 2244.60]  Good morning.
[2244.60 --> 2274.60]  Thank you.
[2274.60 --> 2304.58]  We're in the
[2304.58 --> 2334.58]  joyful.
[2334.60 --> 2364.56]  And we're going to do
[2364.56 --> 2394.54]  and you're going to say,
[2394.56 --> 2424.54]  be with you.
[2424.56 --> 2454.54]  Good morning.
[2454.54 --> 2484.52]  Heavenly Father,
[2484.52 --> 2514.52]  and we're going to do,
[2514.52 --> 2544.50]  we're filled with you.
[2544.50 --> 2574.48]  and we're going to do,
[2574.48 --> 2604.48]  and we're with you, we're going to do,
[2604.48 --> 2634.48]  we're going to do,
[2634.48 --> 2664.46]  we're going to do, we're going to need you, and we're going to do, and we're going to do,
[2664.46 --> 2673.46]  the poor, the marginalized, the divorced, the elderly, the unborn, the sick, the lonely,
[2673.46 --> 2682.46]  the unemployed, the addicts, the enslaved, those grieving.
[2682.46 --> 2687.46]  Father, help us to be just to all your image bearers, wherever they are,
[2687.46 --> 2691.46]  and whatever situation they are in.
[2691.46 --> 2698.46]  Equip our leaders to be caring people that declare our world belongs to you.
[2698.46 --> 2704.46]  Forgive us our sins as we also forgive those who have sinned against us.
[2704.46 --> 2714.46]  Keep us from greed, overconsumption, pride, envy, anger, lust, and laziness.
[2714.46 --> 2729.46]  It's easy to overeat or drink, to ignore the needs of others, to compare gifts, to be in conflict with family.
[2729.46 --> 2732.46]  Lord, forgive us.
[2732.46 --> 2740.46]  Help us to share what we have to help each other and be gentle and kind with everyone we meet this Advent season,
[2740.46 --> 2744.46]  reflecting your love to the world.
[2744.46 --> 2751.46]  Lord, let us be quick to enter into the pain of those around us and see life from their perspective,
[2751.46 --> 2754.46]  to imagine their pain is ours.
[2754.46 --> 2763.46]  Lord, we thank you, Father, that Jesus knows our pain, that he lived, suffered, and died for each one of us,
[2763.46 --> 2771.46]  so that we never have to be alone, and that he felt our temptations, pains, sadness, and afflictions.
[2771.46 --> 2778.46]  He was tempted as we are, yet without sin.
[2778.46 --> 2784.46]  Let the Savior's majesty give us the confidence to boldly approach your throne of grace,
[2784.46 --> 2790.46]  as we offer comfort and seek it ourselves.
[2790.46 --> 2796.46]  We pray at this time for Elaine Benny, who is battling stomach cancer.
[2796.46 --> 2802.46]  Grant him strength, Lord, and healing during this time of trial.
[2802.46 --> 2808.46]  Also support his parents by giving them peace and courage.
[2808.46 --> 2814.46]  We pray for Lina Cepkema and her husband Wes.
[2814.46 --> 2820.46]  As Lina had a fall and ended up in hospital for a number of days,
[2820.46 --> 2826.46]  we pray that you will provide and grant her full healing.
[2826.46 --> 2829.46]  And she's at home now.
[2829.46 --> 2836.46]  We pray for John Kuypers, who also needs the blessing of patience in his trying time,
[2836.46 --> 2839.46]  of very demanding health concerns.
[2839.46 --> 2845.46]  Give that the surgeon has clear plans for tackling his concerns,
[2845.46 --> 2850.46]  and that he can follow a path that will lead to healing and restoration.
[2850.46 --> 2854.46]  Bless John with peace in a time of anxiety.
[2854.46 --> 2862.46]  Bless the Muller and Bolt families, as they grieve the loss of Corr Bolt,
[2862.46 --> 2868.46]  father to Corinne Muller and grandfather to Brianne, Matthew, and Anthony.
[2868.46 --> 2874.46]  We also thank you, Father, with Frank and Sylvia Welfing,
[2874.46 --> 2878.46]  for the birth of their granddaughter, Hazel Josephine.
[2878.46 --> 2883.46]  Thank you that all is well with mother and child.
[2887.46 --> 2892.46]  And so, Lord, in this Advent season, as we see brokenness and despair,
[2892.46 --> 2895.46]  we wait for the promised King.
[2895.46 --> 2898.46]  Help us to hold on to hope and joy,
[2898.46 --> 2904.46]  knowing that Christ's rule has begun and his spirit is renewing creation.
[2904.46 --> 2907.46]  Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[2907.46 --> 2912.46]  Fully establish and restore this kingdom on earth as it is in heaven.
[2912.46 --> 2915.46]  Bring justice where there is oppression,
[2915.46 --> 2917.46]  peace where there is conflict,
[2917.46 --> 2920.46]  and healing where there is suffering.
[2920.46 --> 2923.46]  May your glory dwell in our land,
[2923.46 --> 2927.46]  and your light shine in the darkness.
[2927.46 --> 2933.46]  Make our joy complete in anticipation of Christ's full return and rule.
[2935.46 --> 2937.46]  You keep covenant forever, O God.
[2937.46 --> 2941.46]  You come to us now in your people and your spirit,
[2941.46 --> 2943.46]  and you will come again in glory.
[2943.46 --> 2949.46]  We await you, the God who comes with expectant hearts.
[2949.46 --> 2953.46]  In Jesus' name, Amen.
[2953.46 --> 2955.46]  Amen.
[2968.46 --> 2969.46]  Okay.
[2970.46 --> 2972.46]  Thank you, Pim, for praying.
[2973.46 --> 2974.46]  Good morning, everybody.
[2974.46 --> 2978.46]  We are reading from two passages today, as we've been doing in Advent.
[2978.46 --> 2983.46]  We are reading from Luke 2, verses 8 to 20,
[2983.46 --> 2986.46]  and Matthew 2, verses 1 to 12.
[2986.46 --> 2989.46]  I encourage you to go get a Bible or open up your phones.
[2990.46 --> 2992.46]  While you're doing that,
[2992.46 --> 2997.46]  on Wednesdays and Thursdays, I've been working at Gateway Christian Reformed Church
[2997.46 --> 3001.46]  just for the interim while they can find a youth pastor for a permanent position.
[3001.46 --> 3007.46]  While I'm there, I have to give a short message in front of about a hundred youth both nights.
[3008.46 --> 3009.46]  Gateway's too big of a church.
[3010.46 --> 3015.46]  And that has really made this way less nerve-wracking.
[3018.46 --> 3020.46]  They're a much harder crowd.
[3021.46 --> 3025.46]  That being said, I'm going to quickly pray, and then we're going to read the Bible today.
[3025.46 --> 3026.46]  Dear Lord, thank you for this day.
[3026.46 --> 3030.46]  Thank you for a chance to preach, and thank you for a chance to hear your word.
[3030.46 --> 3033.46]  I pray, Lord, that the words that come out of my mouth are not my own, but yours.
[3034.46 --> 3039.46]  And I pray, Lord, that we would be blessed by these stories about the shepherds and the Magi,
[3040.46 --> 3041.46]  and most importantly, Christ.
[3042.46 --> 3044.46]  In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[3045.46 --> 3046.46]  Okay.
[3047.46 --> 3049.46]  Luke 2, verse 8.
[3049.46 --> 3056.46]  And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night.
[3056.46 --> 3061.46]  An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.
[3062.46 --> 3064.46]  But the angel said to them,
[3064.46 --> 3065.46]  Do not be afraid.
[3068.46 --> 3072.46]  I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people.
[3072.46 --> 3077.46]  Today, in the town of David, a Savior has been born to you.
[3077.46 --> 3080.46]  He is the Messiah, the Lord.
[3081.46 --> 3082.46]  This will be a sign to you.
[3082.46 --> 3086.46]  You will find a baby, wrapped in clothes and lying in a manger.
[3087.46 --> 3091.46]  And suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel,
[3092.46 --> 3093.46]  praising God and saying,
[3093.46 --> 3097.46]  Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.
[3097.46 --> 3103.46]  When the angels left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another,
[3104.46 --> 3108.46]  Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.
[3109.46 --> 3113.46]  So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and the baby, who was lying in a manger.
[3114.46 --> 3118.46]  When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told of them about this child.
[3119.46 --> 3123.46]  And all who heard of it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.
[3123.46 --> 3127.46]  But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.
[3128.46 --> 3132.46]  The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen,
[3133.46 --> 3135.46]  which were just as they had been told.
[3137.46 --> 3139.46]  And now Matthew 2, verses 1-12.
[3139.46 --> 3145.46]  After Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in Judea, during the time of King Herod,
[3146.46 --> 3149.46]  Magi from the east came to Jerusalem and asked,
[3150.46 --> 3152.46]  Where is the one who has been born King of the Jews?
[3153.46 --> 3156.46]  We saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.
[3158.46 --> 3162.46]  When King Herod heard this, he was disturbed, and all of Jerusalem with him.
[3162.46 --> 3167.46]  When he had called together all the people's chief priests and the teachers of the law,
[3167.46 --> 3169.46]  he asked them where the Messiah was to be born.
[3170.46 --> 3173.46]  In Bethlehem, in Judea, they replied.
[3174.46 --> 3175.46]  For this is what the prophet has written.
[3176.46 --> 3184.46]  For you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judea, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah.
[3184.46 --> 3190.46]  For out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.
[3191.46 --> 3197.46]  Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.
[3198.46 --> 3200.46]  He sent them to Bethlehem and said,
[3201.46 --> 3202.46]  Go and search carefully for the child.
[3203.46 --> 3207.46]  As soon as you find him, report to me so that I too may go and worship him.
[3208.46 --> 3211.46]  After they had heard the king, they went on their way,
[3211.46 --> 3214.46]  and the star that they had seen when it arose went ahead of them
[3214.46 --> 3216.46]  until it stopped over the place where the child was.
[3217.46 --> 3220.46]  When they saw the star, they were overjoyed.
[3221.46 --> 3225.46]  On coming to the house, they saw that the child was with his mother,
[3225.46 --> 3227.46]  and they bowed down and worshipped him.
[3228.46 --> 3234.46]  Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
[3234.46 --> 3237.46]  And having been warned in a dream not to go back to here,
[3237.46 --> 3240.46]  they returned to their country by another route.
[3241.46 --> 3242.46]  The word of the Lord.
[3246.46 --> 3253.46]  The Christmas season is often a time where people can be either more frustrated and crazed and angry than usual
[3254.46 --> 3257.46]  because of shopping or expectations or road conditions.
[3258.46 --> 3263.46]  Or for others, it can be a place where people are more lonely due to the focus on family and community.
[3263.46 --> 3268.46]  And there could be a real, very real pain there.
[3268.46 --> 3278.46]  It can also be a time where people are happier due to the lights and the music that exude a sense of comfort and warmth amidst the dreary winter weather.
[3278.46 --> 3282.46]  Christmas is my favorite holiday.
[3282.46 --> 3289.46]  The candles we fill our churches and homes with and lights that line the streets and the stores at night.
[3289.46 --> 3293.46]  Their warm light gives off a general sense of comfort that is beautiful.
[3293.46 --> 3300.46]  The stores and malls are decorated in colors and trees that fill us with nostalgia of our favorite Christmas movies and memories.
[3300.46 --> 3306.46]  I love family gatherings, work parties, and gift exchanges.
[3306.46 --> 3308.46]  I love how it makes me feel.
[3308.46 --> 3319.46]  I like walking at night and seeing that glow in the sky when the lights are reflecting off the clouds from the city.
[3319.46 --> 3322.46]  It's a beautiful, wonderful time of year.
[3322.46 --> 3327.46]  I wish our cities and our neighborhoods can be like this the rest of the time.
[3327.46 --> 3336.46]  Why can't we be living this happiness, this general sense of kindness for more than just a month at a time?
[3336.46 --> 3343.46]  But when writing this, I noticed not once did I mention Jesus when I described why I like Christmas.
[3343.46 --> 3350.46]  But I guess that answers my question on why we can't keep this Christmas happiness all year round.
[3350.46 --> 3359.46]  We can't because the happiness I described, though good and pleasant, is not rooted in the one who can give us a joy that never ends.
[3359.46 --> 3367.46]  This general sense of happiness is rooted in things like lights and songs and commercials and movies and stores.
[3367.46 --> 3369.46]  These things fade.
[3369.46 --> 3373.46]  And we even sense that with every passing Christmas.
[3373.46 --> 3376.46]  The store's decorations become less elaborate.
[3376.46 --> 3380.46]  New, good, Christmas music is harder to find.
[3380.46 --> 3384.46]  And everything is becoming more and more corporate and manufactured.
[3384.46 --> 3389.46]  These things are temporal and they constantly shift and change.
[3389.46 --> 3393.46]  They are not fit to be the root of our joy.
[3393.46 --> 3402.46]  I devote myself to that vision of a nostalgic dream that I deem to be real Christmas.
[3402.46 --> 3408.46]  A dream that when those lights and decorations and songs arrive, it means Christmas is finally here.
[3408.46 --> 3410.46]  But that's not true.
[3410.46 --> 3415.46]  I'm always left a little wanting when lights and decorations leave.
[3415.46 --> 3419.46]  I always want more when Boxing Day comes around.
[3419.46 --> 3426.46]  They can't satisfy me because they are fleeting.
[3426.46 --> 3428.46]  They're impermanent.
[3428.46 --> 3431.46]  And I need to be reminded of this every single year.
[3431.46 --> 3436.46]  And this sermon has been one of the best reminders for me of this.
[3436.46 --> 3444.46]  Jesus is the only source that is unshaking and unlimited, no matter the time or circumstance.
[3444.46 --> 3448.46]  But that joy requires us to see who he is.
[3448.46 --> 3453.46]  If we let our vision of Christmas be determined by ourselves or corporate interest in commercials,
[3453.46 --> 3459.46]  then we won't be able to see this season of Advent and the awaiting of Christ properly.
[3459.46 --> 3465.46]  We won't be able to see him for who he is, and we won't be able to worship him as we ought to.
[3465.46 --> 3469.46]  And that's our big idea today in this third week of Advent.
[3469.46 --> 3475.46]  Joy breaks in when we see Christ for who he is and give him our worship.
[3475.46 --> 3484.46]  Only when we see Christ for who he is and worship him can we have a proper sense of Christmas joy.
[3484.46 --> 3490.46]  And responding in worship which is the only natural outflow of a proper joy found in Christ.
[3490.46 --> 3496.46]  The proper joy doesn't stop from finding these decorations and songs and lights beautiful and pleasing.
[3496.46 --> 3499.46]  Joy isn't a limited source.
[3499.46 --> 3505.46]  But if we desire them over him, then we will never find him joyful.
[3505.46 --> 3513.46]  We will only see him as a distraction and a threat to our vision of Christmas and life.
[3513.46 --> 3520.46]  Jesus wants to invade every aspect of our life and transform it.
[3520.46 --> 3522.46]  He wants to shape our visions of joy.
[3522.46 --> 3528.46]  He wants to reorient our source of joy to himself where it ought to be.
[3528.46 --> 3535.46]  And if we hold these things above him, as I often do, then we will not have room for him.
[3535.46 --> 3539.46]  But with him at the top, we can always regard these things with joy.
[3539.46 --> 3544.46]  We need to make sure that Christ is our source of joy and our greatest joy.
[3544.46 --> 3548.46]  And we are going to see how that is possible in the lives of the shepherds and the magi.
[3548.46 --> 3553.46]  And lastly, we will see how it is not true in the case of Herod the Great.
[3553.46 --> 3555.46]  First, let's talk about the shepherds.
[3555.46 --> 3562.46]  The shepherds that the angels come to are tending their flocks at night and keeping thieves and wolves away.
[3562.46 --> 3565.46]  These men are dirty, humble, lowly.
[3565.46 --> 3568.46]  In history, these are forgettable people.
[3568.46 --> 3575.46]  Their job was necessary for Israel's survival, both physical and spiritual, for both food and sacrifice.
[3575.46 --> 3581.46]  And even notable characters in the Bible, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, were all shepherds.
[3581.46 --> 3585.46]  Jesus himself calls himself the great shepherd.
[3585.46 --> 3590.46]  The prophecy in Matthew that we read called him a shepherd.
[3590.46 --> 3594.46]  And later in the New Testament, the church's leaders would be called shepherds.
[3594.46 --> 3598.46]  The word pastor in Greek is the word poimen, which means shepherd.
[3598.46 --> 3601.46]  And yet many Israelites looked down on shepherds.
[3601.46 --> 3608.46]  Religious elite looked down on them because they were ritually unclean and would not partake in many of the religious activities.
[3608.46 --> 3614.46]  Pastor Chris mentioned in previous years at Advent that shepherds' witness in court was not counted.
[3614.46 --> 3621.46]  A Jewish midrash, a type of rabbinic literature, that also has this to say about shepherds.
[3621.46 --> 3627.46]  In the whole world, you will find no occupation more despised than that of the shepherd.
[3627.46 --> 3629.46]  That was what they thought.
[3629.46 --> 3635.46]  But God chose shepherds to be the ones who got a visit from the choir of heaven.
[3635.46 --> 3642.46]  These shepherds, despite their humble status, poor, and maybe even lonely lives,
[3642.46 --> 3648.46]  they were overjoyed because they, the thing that they had been waiting for,
[3648.46 --> 3651.46]  the person they had been waiting for, had finally arrived.
[3651.46 --> 3657.46]  And as the angel said, the Messiah has been born to them.
[3657.46 --> 3660.46]  They saw Jesus for who he was.
[3660.46 --> 3664.46]  And when they did, joy broke into their hearts and lives.
[3664.46 --> 3670.46]  They got to see the Savior, the Messiah, the Lord, born into the world.
[3670.46 --> 3675.46]  The promises and prophecies of the Lord had come true.
[3675.46 --> 3681.46]  The God who promised freedom and redemption from every power and evil had arrived.
[3681.46 --> 3685.46]  And when they saw him, they were filled with joy.
[3685.46 --> 3688.46]  They hurried off and spread the news of what they had seen.
[3688.46 --> 3692.46]  They needed to tell people, it says.
[3692.46 --> 3698.46]  The joy of seeing Christ led them to worship him and to speak about him and to praise him.
[3698.46 --> 3702.46]  Remember this, they needed to tell people about him.
[3703.46 --> 3705.46]  Let's jump to the Magi.
[3705.46 --> 3710.46]  The Magi that came to Jesus' birth are a very mysterious group of characters.
[3710.46 --> 3715.46]  We talk so much about their gifts, about how many there were that visited Jesus.
[3715.46 --> 3720.46]  We sometimes call them wise men or kings, depending on the song or Bible translation.
[3720.46 --> 3725.46]  And we constantly discuss when they gave their gifts to Mary or where they came from.
[3725.46 --> 3730.46]  Much of this mystery is due to Magi being from a completely different context
[3730.46 --> 3733.46]  than to the one we grew up here in Canada.
[3733.46 --> 3740.46]  To see who these mysterious fears are, I want to guide us through some areas of the Bible that will be key to seeing that.
[3740.46 --> 3746.46]  And why it is so amazing that such people like the Magi came to Jesus' birth at all.
[3746.46 --> 3750.46]  And why such men would be overjoyed at the birth of the Messiah.
[3750.46 --> 3755.46]  I promise you that as we go through these passages, they will tie in to the theme of Advent.
[3755.46 --> 3758.46]  I'm just going to nerd out for a bit and you're all going to join me.
[3758.46 --> 3762.46]  I might hold you hostage for a few minutes, but that's okay.
[3762.46 --> 3772.46]  In the Old Testament, there are many places where magic and sorcery, divination, astrology, necromancy, and the like are outlawed by God.
[3772.46 --> 3774.46]  Punishable by death.
[3774.46 --> 3782.46]  God strictly outlaws the seeking out of power, abilities, and blessings from anything or anyone other than Him.
[3782.46 --> 3785.46]  Deuteronomy 18, 10-11 says,
[3785.46 --> 3789.46]  Let no one be found among you who sacrifices their son or daughter in the fire,
[3789.46 --> 3795.46]  who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, or casts spells,
[3795.46 --> 3799.46]  or who is a medium, a spiritist, or who consults the dead.
[3799.46 --> 3806.46]  All of these practices are seeking something God gives, but through other avenues.
[3806.46 --> 3811.46]  Like Adam and Eve who sought God's power by becoming like Him rather than seeking Him.
[3811.46 --> 3815.46]  But the one specifically that we will focus on today is divination.
[3815.46 --> 3826.46]  Divination seeks the knowledge of the future through many methods including dreams, stars, natural omens like eclipses, planetary movements,
[3826.46 --> 3830.46]  hoping to understand the will of the gods who control fate and time.
[3830.46 --> 3833.46]  To help people make decisions.
[3833.46 --> 3835.46]  To help people navigate the future.
[3835.46 --> 3837.46]  To help people get what they want.
[3837.46 --> 3845.46]  You don't have to read very far in the Bible to find places where God's people use such practices against His will.
[3845.46 --> 3852.46]  And God responds as He promised He would if His people failed to destroy such people and practices amongst them.
[3852.46 --> 3854.46]  He would do it Himself.
[3854.46 --> 3855.46]  In Isaiah 2-6,
[3855.46 --> 3859.46]  You, Lord, have abandoned your people, the descendants of Jacob.
[3859.46 --> 3862.46]  They are full of superstitions from the East.
[3862.46 --> 3866.46]  They practice divination like the Philistines and embrace pagan customs.
[3866.46 --> 3869.46]  And in Isaiah 47, 12-15,
[3869.46 --> 3875.46]  Keep on then with your magic spells and with your many sorceries, which you have labored at since childhood.
[3875.46 --> 3878.46]  Perhaps you will succeed or perhaps you will cause terror.
[3878.46 --> 3883.46]  All the counsel you have received has only worn you out.
[3883.46 --> 3888.46]  Let your astrologers come forward, those stargazers who make predictions month by month.
[3888.46 --> 3890.46]  Let them save you from what is coming upon you.
[3890.46 --> 3894.46]  Surely they are like stubble. The fire will burn them up.
[3894.46 --> 3900.46]  Surely they cannot even save themselves from the power of the flame.
[3900.46 --> 3903.46]  These are not coals for warmth.
[3903.46 --> 3906.46]  This is not a fire to sit by.
[3906.46 --> 3908.46]  This is all they are to you.
[3908.46 --> 3912.46]  These you have dealt with and labored with since childhood.
[3912.46 --> 3914.46]  All of them go on in their error.
[3914.46 --> 3917.46]  There is not one that can save you.
[3917.46 --> 3921.46]  God is not just outlying it because he doesn't think it is beneficial.
[3921.46 --> 3931.46]  He disdains the practice because it promises that it can be a source of meaning and an answer and a giver of joy without God.
[3931.46 --> 3936.46]  And the Israelites are going to do things that God already promised them.
[3936.46 --> 3939.46]  They are trying to get things that God already promised them.
[3939.46 --> 3946.46]  But now they are caught in their sin and they are crying out to astrology and divination to escape the judgment of God.
[3946.46 --> 3948.46]  Something that could never do that in the first place.
[3948.46 --> 3954.46]  God is reminding them that things like astrology and divination and magic have no power over him.
[3954.46 --> 3957.46]  It has power over nothing.
[3957.46 --> 3959.46]  He is the Lord.
[3959.46 --> 3961.46]  He will decide the future.
[3961.46 --> 3964.46]  They want their dream of the world to come true.
[3964.46 --> 3966.46]  They don't want his dream to come true.
[3966.46 --> 3969.46]  They want to find joy in a world that they can shape.
[3969.46 --> 3971.46]  That they can master.
[3971.46 --> 3973.46]  That they can control.
[3973.46 --> 3980.46]  They are devoting their whole being to finding joy in their dreams rather than devoting themselves to God.
[3980.46 --> 3987.46]  And yet God also chose such people to show that he is Lord over those practices.
[3987.46 --> 3992.46]  In the story of Balaam and his talking donkey found in Numbers 20-25,
[3992.46 --> 3997.46]  Balaam is a seer or a pagan prophet for hire.
[3997.46 --> 4003.46]  He is hired by the king of Moab named Balak to curse Israel with prophetic power.
[4003.46 --> 4012.46]  He wants to cast omens, use witchcraft, sorcery, power to prevent Israel from walking over them as they make their way to the promised land.
[4012.46 --> 4017.46]  But in the story, Balaam is confronted by God before he gets to Moab.
[4017.46 --> 4021.46]  And God tells him to only prophesy what he tells him to.
[4021.46 --> 4022.46]  Remember this.
[4022.46 --> 4025.46]  We are going to come back to those prophecies.
[4025.46 --> 4032.46]  We are now going to jump a thousand years from the story of Balaam to the story of the Exodus.
[4032.46 --> 4033.46]  From...
[4033.46 --> 4035.46]  I am starting over.
[4035.46 --> 4036.46]  I am starting over.
[4036.46 --> 4046.46]  We are now going to jump a thousand years from the story of Balaam and the Exodus in 1500 BC to the story of Daniel in 562 BC.
[4046.46 --> 4047.46]  Okay.
[4047.46 --> 4049.46]  I said it right that time.
[4049.46 --> 4055.46]  Daniel the prophet, as a young boy, is taken by the army of Nebuchadnezzar.
[4055.46 --> 4059.46]  When Babylon takes over the kingdom of Judah, they slaughter most of the people.
[4059.46 --> 4070.46]  But it was also common for them to take slaves as well to take young, fit, intelligent, trainable men who could then become members of their court.
[4070.46 --> 4073.46]  Daniel and his three friends are such people who are taken.
[4073.46 --> 4083.46]  And it's Daniel who becomes a prophet of God who is trained in the pagan arts in Nebuchadnezzar's court by his magi and sorcerers.
[4083.46 --> 4086.46]  And we read this in Daniel 1, 17-20.
[4086.46 --> 4092.46]  To these four young men, God gave knowledge and understanding of all kinds of literature and learning.
[4092.46 --> 4096.46]  And Daniel could understand visions and dreams of all kinds.
[4096.46 --> 4104.46]  At the end of the time, set by the king to bring him into his service, the chief official presented them to Nebuchadnezzar.
[4104.46 --> 4111.46]  The king talked with them and he found none equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, or Azariah.
[4111.46 --> 4114.46]  So they entered the king's service.
[4114.46 --> 4118.46]  In every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king questioned them,
[4118.46 --> 4123.46]  he found them ten times better than all of the magicians and enchanters in his whole kingdom.
[4123.46 --> 4129.46]  You probably know Hananiah and Mishael and Azariah as Meshach, Shadrach, and Abednego.
[4129.46 --> 4132.46]  That is their Babylonian names when they're taken over.
[4132.46 --> 4138.46]  When we read the whole book of Daniel, we find he is constantly confronting these magicians and enchanters.
[4138.46 --> 4140.46]  He is thrown into a pit of lions by them.
[4140.46 --> 4143.46]  He even rules over them later.
[4143.46 --> 4147.46]  But the point remains is that Daniel lives amongst these magi.
[4147.46 --> 4148.46]  They are his people.
[4148.46 --> 4149.46]  He knows their arts.
[4149.46 --> 4152.46]  He may have even practiced them.
[4152.46 --> 4156.46]  But like Balaam did so under God's command.
[4156.46 --> 4164.46]  Magi in Babylon were used to understand dreams and celestial star signs to see if kings would die or be born.
[4164.46 --> 4167.46]  And Daniel did this many times.
[4167.46 --> 4170.46]  He was called to see the writing on the wall more than once.
[4170.46 --> 4174.46]  Daniel was a Magi.
[4174.46 --> 4176.46]  Except he wasn't pagan.
[4176.46 --> 4178.46]  His guide was the Lord.
[4178.46 --> 4183.46]  And he sought answers from none other than him.
[4183.46 --> 4187.46]  Nothing else was his source of visions and dreams.
[4187.46 --> 4191.46]  The spirit was why he could interpret those dreams.
[4191.46 --> 4195.46]  And angels were the ones who would give him his visions.
[4195.46 --> 4198.46]  Believe it or not, this is where we get back to Jesus.
[4198.46 --> 4203.46]  The Magi that visit Jesus, like I mentioned, are a mysterious group.
[4203.46 --> 4208.46]  And reading this story, it looks like they come out of nowhere.
[4208.46 --> 4210.46]  Why are the Magi here?
[4210.46 --> 4215.46]  Well, Magi at the time were very common across the Middle East and the Roman Empire.
[4215.46 --> 4222.46]  The Magi of Jesus' time were astrologers who would mark astrological signs in the sky like shooting stars.
[4222.46 --> 4226.46]  And they would track the movements of planets to determine future events.
[4226.46 --> 4231.46]  If you're thinking right now this sounds like horoscope readers in the Coffee News or on TikTok,
[4231.46 --> 4233.46]  that's exactly the same thing.
[4233.46 --> 4239.46]  That practice that we have today in Coffee News comes from these guys.
[4239.46 --> 4242.46]  This is the original.
[4242.46 --> 4246.46]  Kings would have them in their courts.
[4246.46 --> 4251.46]  They would hire them to see if new kings would be born or if current kings would die.
[4251.46 --> 4252.46]  Some examples.
[4252.46 --> 4261.46]  Nero, the dreaded Roman Emperor, during his reign heard that a star sign was seen and that a ruler would die.
[4261.46 --> 4266.46]  And so to make sure that it wasn't him, he killed a bunch of nobles hoping that that would satisfy the sign.
[4266.46 --> 4278.46]  Or, when other kings were born or chosen, the astrologers would try and find star signs that matched their birth to legitimize their ascendancy to the throne.
[4278.46 --> 4281.46]  And the best Magi always came from the East.
[4281.46 --> 4283.46]  Everyone at that time knew it.
[4283.46 --> 4285.46]  Everyone wanted astronomers from the East in their courts.
[4285.46 --> 4289.46]  And by the East at that time, that means the areas of Babylon and Persia.
[4289.46 --> 4298.46]  That all being said, these guys are just the latest version of those same pagan diviners and magicians that God outlawed in Deuteronomy.
[4298.46 --> 4300.46]  These men are like Balaam.
[4300.46 --> 4305.46]  They could be hired out by kings and these Magi are stated to have come from the East,
[4305.46 --> 4310.46]  meaning that these are the premium Magi that everyone knows and wants.
[4310.46 --> 4322.46]  The Magi that came to Jesus' worship, that came to Jesus to worship him, are the same Magi that God outlawed punishable by death.
[4322.46 --> 4331.46]  The same Magi that Daniel served with and over and probably even from the very same court and school.
[4331.46 --> 4337.46]  In fact, that's probably how they came to know about Jesus' prophecies at all.
[4337.46 --> 4341.46]  That's probably how they came to know that that star was about Jesus.
[4341.46 --> 4350.46]  These Magi probably have in their libraries copy of scripture left by Daniel and all the prophecies of the coming Messiah that were left at the exile.
[4350.46 --> 4356.46]  But what prophecy would these astrologers be following that involves stars about the Messiah?
[4356.46 --> 4363.46]  Now I can't be certain, but there are many hints and clues that lead me to think that if those prophecies about Balaam,
[4363.46 --> 4369.46]  written all the way back before Israel was even a kingdom in Israel, had led them to Jesus, written by Balaam.
[4369.46 --> 4377.46]  Balaam, a fellow pagan diviner like them, commanded by God, prophesied this in Numbers 24, 17-19.
[4377.46 --> 4389.46]  I see him, but not now. I behold him, but not near. A star will come out of Jacob. A scepter will rise out of Israel.
[4389.46 --> 4393.46]  He will crush the foreheads of Moab and the skulls of all the people of Shef.
[4393.46 --> 4396.46]  Edom will be conquered. Remember that line.
[4396.46 --> 4404.46]  Seir, his enemy, will be conquered. But Israel will grow strong. A ruler will come out of Jacob and destroy the survivors of the city.
[4404.46 --> 4413.46]  In this one prophecy from God, spoken by a pagan prophet for hire, we find a prophecy of a future ruler of Israel,
[4413.46 --> 4418.46]  who will conquer the kingdom of Edom, and it mentions that a star will rise out of Jacob.
[4418.46 --> 4424.46]  This prophecy is exactly the sort of thing that these magi would be looking for.
[4424.46 --> 4430.46]  And along with all the other prophecies of Isaiah and Daniel about a coming Messiah to be born in Bethlehem,
[4430.46 --> 4434.46]  these magi have everything they need to find Jesus.
[4434.46 --> 4444.46]  The magi that come to Jesus, pagan astrologers, the very people God outlawed for seeking knowledge and power and control in any other path than God,
[4444.46 --> 4451.46]  these magi are the magicians that got Daniel thrown into the lion's den that served him when he was in Babylon.
[4451.46 --> 4454.46]  These magi are not God's people.
[4454.46 --> 4456.46]  They are not Jewish.
[4456.46 --> 4459.46]  They are the best of the best pagan sinners.
[4459.46 --> 4465.46]  And yet it's those Gentile pagans who when they see the star rise out of Israel,
[4465.46 --> 4468.46]  they see what Israel and their king don't.
[4468.46 --> 4472.46]  They see that the Messiah has been born in Bethlehem.
[4472.46 --> 4474.46]  The king is not Herod.
[4474.46 --> 4476.46]  The king is not a Roman emperor.
[4476.46 --> 4479.46]  The king is a baby born in Bethlehem.
[4479.46 --> 4488.46]  And these pagans, these outlawed criminal pagans, want to worship the God that disdains their practices.
[4488.46 --> 4492.46]  They are overjoyed when they see him.
[4492.46 --> 4495.46]  The stars literally aligned.
[4495.46 --> 4499.46]  God guided them across deserts.
[4499.46 --> 4504.46]  Their pagan astrology matched up with biblical prophecy.
[4504.46 --> 4513.46]  And again, not a single priest, not a single scribe, not a Pharisee, not a Sadducee or rabbi to be seen.
[4513.46 --> 4518.46]  None of the people who had the books, the scriptures or the words handed down from God.
[4518.46 --> 4523.46]  None of them saw Jesus for who he was and came to worship him.
[4523.46 --> 4529.46]  Just some dispossessed shepherds who needed to tell people about what they saw.
[4529.46 --> 4534.46]  And the pagan magi from another empire needed to give him gifts and worship him.
[4534.46 --> 4537.46]  But none of the people that should have been there.
[4537.46 --> 4539.46]  None of the priests.
[4539.46 --> 4541.46]  None of the people.
[4541.46 --> 4548.46]  Instead, the people at the hearing of the Messiah has been born are disturbed.
[4548.46 --> 4550.46]  They are shocked.
[4550.46 --> 4553.46]  They don't immediately rush to find the Messiah that they've been waiting for.
[4553.46 --> 4554.46]  No.
[4554.46 --> 4558.46]  All of Jerusalem is disturbed with its king.
[4558.46 --> 4561.46]  And that king is our next character, Herod.
[4561.46 --> 4564.46]  All of Jerusalem doesn't rush to find the promised king.
[4564.46 --> 4571.46]  They sit in their disturbance and they go to Herod, the puppet king, placed by the Roman conquerors.
[4571.46 --> 4577.46]  And as a result of this disturbing news, the king, Herod, seeks out the magi to speak to them secretly.
[4577.46 --> 4584.46]  He seeks them and asks them to find the child and report to him so that he may worship them too.
[4584.46 --> 4590.46]  But when they find Jesus, they receive a dream that warns them not to tell Herod, so they go home another route.
[4590.46 --> 4603.46]  Initially, they may have believed Herod, but after that dream they received, they knew that this Herod was seeking their expertise as magi for the same paranoid and tyrannical reason that Nero had his nobles murdered.
[4603.46 --> 4606.46]  Herod had no intention of worshiping this child.
[4606.46 --> 4615.46]  And as we learn by reading the story, Herod sends men to the city and kills every child under the age of two to stop this Messiah from becoming king.
[4615.46 --> 4621.46]  Herod was not overjoyed at the birth of Jesus, the way the shepherd or the magi were.
[4621.46 --> 4622.46]  No.
[4622.46 --> 4626.46]  Herod's power was going to suddenly come to an end.
[4626.46 --> 4628.46]  The real king had arrived.
[4628.46 --> 4632.46]  Herod knew he was a puppet, placed by the Roman government.
[4632.46 --> 4640.46]  He knew his power relied on brutalistic murder of relatives and playing political games to get religious elite in his pocket.
[4640.46 --> 4645.46]  Never mind the fact that he wasn't even an Israelite.
[4645.46 --> 4647.46]  No, Herod was an Edomite.
[4647.46 --> 4649.46]  He's from Edom.
[4649.46 --> 4653.46]  Herod was a descendant of Esau, not Jacob.
[4653.46 --> 4662.46]  And as we read in Numbers 24, when that star rises out of Israel, the king would conquer Edom.
[4662.46 --> 4665.46]  Herod knows the story of Esau and Jacob.
[4665.46 --> 4669.46]  And Jacob's trick to take the blessing from Esau's grasp.
[4669.46 --> 4674.46]  This new king would not take his kingdom from his grasp.
[4674.46 --> 4675.46]  No.
[4675.46 --> 4679.46]  Finally, Herod, Esau's descendant, was king.
[4679.46 --> 4685.46]  He was king of God's people, God's land, and God's promise that was his, not Jacob's.
[4685.46 --> 4690.46]  No one, no Israelite was going to take that power that was rightfully his.
[4690.46 --> 4694.46]  No one would take that from him, especially if that promised king was dead.
[4694.46 --> 4700.46]  Joy is not the word I would use to describe Herod's reaction at the news of the birth of Jesus.
[4700.46 --> 4701.46]  No.
[4701.46 --> 4707.46]  Herod was afraid, angry, anything but joyful.
[4707.46 --> 4711.46]  Something had interrupted his finely crafted world.
[4711.46 --> 4716.46]  Something was interrupting and threatening his vision of his life.
[4716.46 --> 4718.46]  Jesus entered into Herod's life.
[4718.46 --> 4721.46]  Jesus was interrupting Herod's self-made kingdom.
[4721.46 --> 4725.46]  Herod sought joy in power and making himself king.
[4725.46 --> 4728.46]  He couldn't let Jesus be king.
[4728.46 --> 4730.46]  And this is the difference.
[4730.46 --> 4735.46]  Where the Magi and the shepherds see that the king of Israel was a baby born in Bethlehem,
[4735.46 --> 4737.46]  Herod only sees a threat.
[4737.46 --> 4739.46]  Another problem he needs to solve.
[4739.46 --> 4743.46]  A hurdle preventing his vision of a perfect life coming true.
[4744.46 --> 4746.46]  They see him for who he is.
[4746.46 --> 4752.46]  And they are overjoyed at the prospect and rushed to travel long distances to find him and worship him.
[4752.46 --> 4758.46]  The shepherds left their sheep and traveled in the night to find Jesus at the witness of the choir of heaven.
[4758.46 --> 4769.46]  The Magi left their homes and traveled far distances, probably taking weeks if not months to bring wealth and gifts to a baby and worship him.
[4769.46 --> 4779.46]  Herod sent an army to slaughter, not just the boy, but every boy in the town to keep what he had.
[4779.46 --> 4792.46]  The joy of Advent is not found in our perfect snowy Christmas morning with Christmas trees and presents and family dinners, though that is beautiful, and good, and should be enjoyed.
[4792.46 --> 4799.84]  dream. The joy of Advent is not found in our perfect snowy Christmas morning with Christmas
[4799.84 --> 4805.88]  trees and presents and family dinners, though that is beautiful and good and should be enjoyed.
[4806.42 --> 4813.10]  The joy of Advent is seeing that our Savior, our Messiah, the Lord, was born in Bethlehem,
[4813.66 --> 4820.38]  worshipped by the humble and lowly shepherds and the pagan and mysterious magi. He grew up,
[4820.38 --> 4824.86]  he lived the perfect life that we should have lived, died the death we should have died. He
[4824.86 --> 4830.24]  rose on the third day. He ascended with the promise of his return that we faithfully await.
[4831.12 --> 4838.94]  Our joy of Advent is knowing that our faithful Savior, our Messiah, our Lord, lived and died for
[4838.94 --> 4850.04]  us so that we can live with him. Joy breaks in when we see Christ for who he is and give him our worship.
[4851.38 --> 4857.22]  We can't let the voices of culture and advertisement be the last word on what Christmas ought to be like.
[4857.72 --> 4864.00]  We also can't let our dreams and visions of the future shape what Christmas ought to be like.
[4864.38 --> 4871.76]  We need to let Christ be the one that shapes this Advent. We need to let Christ be the one
[4871.76 --> 4878.08]  that shapes our vision of joy. And here's some ways we can do that. There's three ways. One,
[4878.08 --> 4884.40]  we need to tell the world about the joy we have in Jesus. Because of the joy the shepherds received
[4884.40 --> 4891.72]  from seeing Christ, they needed to tell people. Let's let the joy of this Christmas cause us to need
[4891.72 --> 4900.66]  to tell people about Jesus. We all know those people who we want to share Christ to. We just might feel
[4900.66 --> 4906.00]  uncomfortable in doing it or we're worried about how that relationship will be affected by that
[4906.00 --> 4916.64]  conversation. We need to let the joy of Christmas help us fuel that desire to tell them. Second, we need to
[4916.64 --> 4922.42]  worship the Lord and give everything like the Magi. Like the Magi who were overjoyed at seeing Christ
[4922.42 --> 4928.28]  and were compelled to worship Jesus and bring gifts. The joy of Advent needs to be our source
[4928.28 --> 4934.12]  of worship to him. The joy of Advent needs to be the source of worship to Christ.
[4934.12 --> 4942.48]  Let that joy that only comes from Christ push us to more. To forgive that person who hurt us. Make
[4942.48 --> 4947.66]  meals for those in need. Spending time with those who find themselves lonely this season. Inviting them
[4947.66 --> 4956.06]  to dinner and maybe even Christmas morning. Showing love to an enemy. Lastly, let's give our visions
[4956.06 --> 4963.96]  and dreams of what Christmas ought to be to Christ. Unlike Herod, who held close to his vision of what
[4963.96 --> 4969.14]  his life and joy needed to be, we need to give all our assumptions and sources of joy this season to
[4969.14 --> 4975.44]  him and place them under Jesus. We need to submit everything under him. I need to submit my material
[4975.44 --> 4982.92]  vision of joy that I got from corporate Christmas under Christ. If there are songs or food or traditions
[4982.92 --> 4988.84]  that are your image of what Christmas is or my image of what Christmas is, they need to be placed under
[4988.84 --> 4995.64]  Christ and his vision. If there are things we do at Christmas that get in our way or if there's people
[4995.64 --> 5004.48]  that their presence ruins our sense of Christmas, we need to let Christ's presence change that. We need
[5004.48 --> 5009.74]  to let Christ's presence fill us with joy so that we can love them and be around them the same way he was
[5009.74 --> 5019.40]  around us. Let's see Jesus for who he is and worship him and have that joy this Christmas. Let's pray.
[5021.32 --> 5027.72]  Dear Lord, thank you for this wonderful day. All the rain and all the weather. Thank you for this time
[5027.72 --> 5033.30]  of year where we get to reflect on the waiting of your coming again. I pray, Lord, that as we
[5033.30 --> 5039.52]  as we go from this place, Lord, we would be fueled by the joy of you breaking into our lives,
[5040.34 --> 5045.82]  that we would have feel the need to tell people about you, that we would feel the need to worship
[5045.82 --> 5051.32]  you wherever we are with everything we are, and that we would submit every vision and dream of what
[5051.32 --> 5056.50]  Christmas or life ought to be like under your vision. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[5063.30 --> 5071.46]  The joy of meeting Christ in worship, the joy of being met by Christ in the word,
[5071.80 --> 5078.98]  is the joy that we now continue to encounter here at the table. As we come to the table of our Lord,
[5079.04 --> 5084.40]  we're going to move through some liturgy together. You'll see on the screen behind me places for you to
[5084.40 --> 5091.94]  speak and participate. As we come to this moment together, let's come to God in prayer.
[5093.30 --> 5104.52]  You, God, are holy. You are a God of majesty, and blessed is Jesus Christ, your Son, our Lord.
[5105.12 --> 5111.24]  You sent him into this world to satisfy the longings of your people for a Savior,
[5111.46 --> 5117.54]  to bring freedom to the captives of sin, and to establish justice for the oppressed.
[5117.54 --> 5127.16]  He came among us as one of us, taking the lot of the poor and sharing in human suffering.
[5128.52 --> 5137.16]  We rejoice that in your death, Lord Jesus, and in your rising again, you set before us the sure promise
[5137.16 --> 5145.00]  of new life, the certain hope of a heavenly home where we will sit at table with Christ,
[5145.00 --> 5150.86]  our host, our host forever. In his name we pray. Amen.
[5154.26 --> 5159.92]  As the word became flesh, born of a woman on that night long ago,
[5160.36 --> 5166.56]  so on the night in which he gave himself up for us, he took bread.
[5166.56 --> 5173.88]  He gave thanks to God, he broke the bread, and he gave it to his disciples, and he said,
[5174.12 --> 5182.86]  take, eat, this is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.
[5184.24 --> 5191.44]  And when the supper was over, he took the cup, and he gave thanks to God, he gave it to his disciples,
[5191.44 --> 5200.40]  and again, he said, drink from this, all of you. This is my blood of the new covenant poured out
[5200.40 --> 5208.38]  for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.
[5208.38 --> 5219.52]  And so, in living remembrance of Jesus, in living remembrance of these mighty acts of Jesus,
[5219.84 --> 5228.02]  we offer ourselves in praise and thanksgiving as a holy and living sacrifice. In union with Christ's
[5228.02 --> 5237.68]  offering for us, we proclaim the mystery of our faith. Your death, O Christ, we proclaim.
[5237.68 --> 5247.10]  Your resurrection, we affirm with joy. Your coming, we await with hope. Glory be to you, Lord Jesus.
[5248.64 --> 5256.12]  Church family, in this Advent season, we come to the Lord's table, prepared for all who love him and
[5256.12 --> 5265.30]  trust in him alone for salvation. And so come to this table, you who wait in hope and you who long for
[5265.30 --> 5272.76]  more. Come to this table, you who have been here often and you who have been away. You who follow
[5272.76 --> 5283.96]  faithfully and those of us who stumble and fall. Come, for Christ has come and Christ will come again.
[5284.62 --> 5292.08]  Whether you are here in person or joining us from home, come. It is Christ himself who invites us to
[5292.08 --> 5298.94]  meet him at this table. These are the gifts of God for the people of God.
[5299.94 --> 5305.46]  As we come forward to this table, we will do so in groups. We will have some ushers indicating
[5305.46 --> 5312.26]  how you or when you may come forward. We will gather in a circle around this table and we will pass
[5312.26 --> 5317.02]  the elements to our left or to our right. As you pass the bread, we invite you to say,
[5317.02 --> 5323.52]  the body of Christ given for you. As you pass the juice, we invite you to say, the blood of Christ
[5323.52 --> 5330.32]  shed for you. And then we will receive that. We will all eat together in our groups here and then
[5330.32 --> 5338.20]  the next group will come forward. On each tray of bread are some gluten-free bread pieces. Please
[5338.20 --> 5343.88]  take that if you need. And if you are unable to come to the front, please indicate that to the
[5343.88 --> 5351.02]  usher elder and they will meet you at your seat and serve you there with individual service as well.
[5351.66 --> 5356.66]  Throughout our coming to the table, we will have the worship team up front. They'll lead us in singing
[5356.66 --> 5361.56]  and there will be some people in the foyer if you would like to meet them for prayer. They'd love to
[5361.56 --> 5367.58]  meet you and pray with you during that time. I want to invite the worship team up and the back of
[5367.58 --> 5373.52]  house and the elders who will serve to the first table and that way they can help us and
[5373.52 --> 5376.16]  facilitate our service for the remaining tables.
[5403.52 --> 5404.52]  Thank you.
[5404.52 --> 5405.52]  Thank you.
[5433.52 --> 5434.02]  Thank you.
[5434.18 --> 5434.52]  Thank you.
[5434.52 --> 5434.76]  Thank you.
[5463.52 --> 5493.50]  Thank you.
[5493.52 --> 5523.50]  Thank you.
[5523.52 --> 5553.50]  Thank you.
[5553.52 --> 5583.50]  Thank you.

[5643.52 --> 5645.52]  Thank you.
[5673.52 --> 5675.52]  Thank you.
[5675.52 --> 5677.52]  Thank you.

[5690.52 --> 5693.52]  Alleluia.
[5693.52 --> 5700.52]  Jesus is my life.
[5700.52 --> 5724.52]  Now, Lord, I would be yours alone and live so all might see. The strength to follow your commands could never come from me.
[5724.52 --> 5734.52]  Oh, Father, use my ransom life in any way you choose.
[5734.52 --> 5746.52]  And let my song forever be my only boast in truth.
[5746.52 --> 5748.52]  Alleluia.

[5782.00 --> 5787.68]  Alleluia
[5787.68 --> 5794.08]  Jesus is my life
[5805.52 --> 5814.80]  Father everlasting
[5814.80 --> 5819.76]  The Uncreating One
[5819.76 --> 5823.22]  God Almighty
[5823.22 --> 5829.78]  Through your Holy Spirit
[5829.78 --> 5834.64]  Conceiving Christ our Son

[5862.40 --> 5869.62]  For I believe in the name of Jesus
[5869.62 --> 5887.06]  Our judge and our defender
[5887.06 --> 5890.68]  Suffered and crucified
[5890.68 --> 5895.90]  For forgiveness is in you
[5895.90 --> 5901.94]  Descended into darkness
[5901.94 --> 5905.90]  You rose in glorious light
[5905.90 --> 5909.90]  Forever seeing I
[5909.90 --> 5915.12]  I believe in God our Father
[5915.12 --> 5919.12]  I believe in Christ the Son
[5919.12 --> 5923.00]  I believe in the Holy Spirit

[5982.88 --> 5994.18]  I believe that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[5999.06 --> 6003.56]  I believe in life eternal.
[6004.38 --> 6006.88]  I believe in the virgin birth.
[6006.88 --> 6014.86]  I believe in the saints communion and in your holy church.
[6015.00 --> 6021.64]  I believe in the resurrection when Jesus comes again.
[6022.12 --> 6027.92]  For I believe in the name of Jesus.
[6027.92 --> 6031.96]  I believe in God our Father.
[6032.58 --> 6034.92]  I believe in Christ the Son.
[6036.12 --> 6038.98]  I believe in the Holy Spirit.
[6039.68 --> 6042.68]  Our God is three in one.

[6093.54 --> 6123.52]  I believe in the name of Jesus.
[6123.52 --> 6125.52]  I believe in the name of Jesus.
[6125.52 --> 6127.60]  I believe in the name of Jesus.
[6127.60 --> 6129.64]  I believe in the name of Jesus.
[6129.64 --> 6135.44]  I believe in the presence of Jesus the Nazarene.
[6135.44 --> 6142.44]  And wonder how we could call thee.
[6142.44 --> 6147.44]  A circled and unclean.
[6147.44 --> 6149.82]  We're singing.
[6149.82 --> 6152.74]  How marvelous.
[6153.68 --> 6155.44]  How wonderful.
[6157.44 --> 6162.44]  And my song shall ever be.
[6162.44 --> 6164.44]  How marvelous.
[6164.44 --> 6165.44]  How marvelous.
[6165.44 --> 6169.44]  How wonderful.
[6169.44 --> 6176.44]  Is my Savior's love for me.
[6176.44 --> 6176.88]  He took my sins and my sorrow.
[6176.88 --> 6193.44]  He made them his very own.
[6193.44 --> 6207.56]  And He bore the blood into Calvary, and suffered and died no more.
[6207.56 --> 6221.74]  We're singing, how marvelous, how wonderful, and my song shall ever be.
[6221.74 --> 6235.74]  How marvelous, how wonderful, and my Savior's home for me.
[6235.74 --> 6257.74]  And with the ransomed in glory, His face I at last shall see.
[6257.74 --> 6271.74]  It will be my joy through the ages, to sing of His love for me.
[6271.74 --> 6285.74]  We're singing, how marvelous, how wonderful, and my song shall ever be.
[6285.74 --> 6299.74]  How marvelous, how wonderful, and my Savior's home for me.
[6299.74 --> 6314.74]  We're singing, how marvelous, how wonderful, and my song shall ever be.
[6314.74 --> 6329.74]  How marvelous, how wonderful, and my Savior's love for me.

[6453.08 --> 6468.08]  A praise to God, O unsanified, the Son of God, here for me.
[6468.08 --> 6481.08]  My daddy raised and my daddy dies, that I, I live.

[6575.08 --> 6593.82]  From the scholar of a borrowed stable
[6593.82 --> 6600.34]  By the spirit and a virgin's faith
[6600.34 --> 6605.78]  To the anguish and the shade of scandal
[6605.78 --> 6612.16]  Came the Savior of the human race
[6612.16 --> 6618.98]  But the skies were filled with the praise of Lamb
[6618.98 --> 6624.10]  Shepherds listened as the angels tell
[6624.10 --> 6630.10]  Of the gift of God come down to man
[6630.64 --> 6635.58]  At the dawning of Emmanuel
[6635.58 --> 6647.54]  King of heaven, now the friend of sinners
[6647.54 --> 6653.36]  Humble servant in the Father's land
[6653.36 --> 6659.48]  Filled with power and the Holy Spirit
[6659.48 --> 6665.54]  Filled with mercy for the broken man
[6666.08 --> 6672.54]  Yes, He walked my road and He felt my faith
[6672.54 --> 6678.76]  Joys and sorrows that I know so
[6678.76 --> 6685.94]  Yet His righteousness give me hope again
[6685.94 --> 6691.20]  I will follow my Emmanuel
[6691.20 --> 6702.94]  Through the kisses of a friend's betrayal
[6702.94 --> 6709.84]  He was lifted on a cruel cross
[6709.84 --> 6716.26]  He was punished for a world's transgressions
[6716.26 --> 6722.54]  He was suffering to save the lost
[6722.54 --> 6726.20]  He fights for breath
[6726.20 --> 6730.06]  He fights for me
[6730.06 --> 6735.70]  Losing sinners from the claims of God
[6735.70 --> 6742.08]  And with a shout our souls are free
[6742.08 --> 6747.62]  Death defeated by Emmanuel
[6747.62 --> 6759.82]  Now be standing in the face of honor
[6759.82 --> 6765.94]  Ground with glory on the highest throne
[6765.94 --> 6766.94]  In the face of God
[6766.94 --> 6767.94]  In the face of God
[6767.94 --> 6771.68]  Interceding for His own beloved
[6771.68 --> 6777.94]  Till His Father calls to bring Him over
[6777.94 --> 6782.14]  Then the skies will part
[6782.14 --> 6785.84]  As the trumpet sounds
[6785.84 --> 6791.22]  Hope of heaven or the fear of hell
[6791.22 --> 6794.22]  But the pride will run
[6794.22 --> 6798.22]  To the Lord's heart
[6798.22 --> 6799.22]  But the pride will run
[6799.22 --> 6802.22]  But the pride will run
[6802.22 --> 6803.22]  To the Father's heart
[6803.22 --> 6804.22]  But the pride will run
[6804.22 --> 6805.22]  To the Father's heart
[6805.22 --> 6807.22]  And the skies will run
[6807.22 --> 6808.22]  And the skies will run
[6808.22 --> 6811.22]  As the trumpet sounds
[6811.22 --> 6816.22]  Hope of heaven or the fear of hell
[6816.22 --> 6817.22]  But the pride will run
[6817.22 --> 6820.22]  But the pride will run
[6820.22 --> 6821.22]  To the Lord's heart
[6821.22 --> 6822.22]  But the pride will run
[6822.22 --> 6823.22]  To the Lord's heart
[6823.22 --> 6829.22]  Giving glory to Emmanuel
[6829.22 --> 6844.22]  As we go out in the joy of Christ
[6844.22 --> 6846.22]  Go with this blessing
[6846.22 --> 6850.22]  The Lord bless you and keep you
[6850.22 --> 6852.22]  The Lord make His face shine on you
[6852.22 --> 6854.22]  And be gracious to you
[6854.22 --> 6856.22]  The Lord turn His face towards you
[6856.22 --> 6857.22]  And give you peace
[6857.22 --> 6858.22]  Amen
[6874.22 --> 6876.22]  Come all you weary

[6896.22 --> 6897.22]  Come find His mercy
[6897.22 --> 6899.22]  Come to the table
[6899.22 --> 6901.22]  He will satisfy
[6901.22 --> 6902.22]  Taste of His goodness
