[0.00 --> 6.72]  Announcement for Pastor Kevin, just about youth. Youth is meeting tonight for 2020. That's here.
[6.82 --> 11.46]  If you have any questions, you can talk to Kevin or your leaders. And then also on Tuesday,
[12.54 --> 18.14]  the Langley churches, a number of churches from the Langley area are gathering their youth groups
[18.14 --> 23.66]  together for a special worship night that's being hosted at Living Waters. If you are part of the
[23.66 --> 28.10]  youth program, you or your parents or guardians have gotten an email about that. But anyways,
[28.10 --> 34.68]  you can check with Kevin again if you've got questions there as well. Leanne, why don't you go?
[35.08 --> 40.76]  Perfect. Thank you. This is on behalf of the Women's Committee. Today is the last day to sign up for our
[40.76 --> 45.28]  Friday Women's Christmas event. We have a lot of attendees who are coming from outside of our
[45.28 --> 49.06]  church, which is amazing. So we do ask the congregants who are coming from our church,
[49.14 --> 54.02]  so please bear that in mind when you're planning what appy, dessert or both that you want to bring.
[54.02 --> 58.70]  Today we are also looking for a couple more decorators. So if you feel inclined to decorate
[58.70 --> 63.14]  a table, just come let us know at the back of the church that that interests you, or you can still
[63.14 --> 69.02]  sign up online today. Men, we have no cutoff date for you though. We will always take you to come help
[69.02 --> 73.98]  with the clean up. So please come and join us if you would like to help move some tables. Thanks.
[79.74 --> 88.70]  Two more quick announcements. This coming Wednesday is the midweek worship night. We invite you to come
[88.70 --> 96.42]  out for that. This was our second gathering. We gather at 6 30 for a time of social and fellowship
[96.42 --> 102.94]  beforehand, and then at 7 worship begins in earnest. And so I encourage you to come out on Wednesday
[102.94 --> 110.04]  night for midweek worship. And then lastly, children's worship time is looking for one more helper.
[110.94 --> 116.16]  And so that helper can be anyone in grade six or older. Children's worship time is looking for one
[116.16 --> 122.14]  more helper. So you can get either Rachel or myself or Pastor Kevin for that. We'd love to help you,
[122.26 --> 128.08]  plug you in with that. That's it for announcements. So I'm going to ask if you're able, if you might stand
[128.08 --> 136.96]  up together, and we can come into the presence of our God. Following the greeting of God, I invite you
[136.96 --> 141.86]  to turn to those around you and welcome them into our worship together. Receive God's greeting.
[141.86 --> 150.08]  grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son,
[150.42 --> 155.38]  and our Savior, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[171.86 --> 185.06]  Baptist Joachim Masional Church
[185.06 --> 206.58]  This morning, we are invited into worship with the words of the psalmist, who said,
[206.58 --> 216.22]  I will remember the deeds of the Lord. Even as we gather to remember, we know the Lord remembers his covenant forever.
[217.02 --> 226.88]  And the Lord remembers us and will bless us. Together, let us exalt the Lord our God and worship at his footstool. He is holy.
[236.58 --> 237.58]  Amen.
[266.58 --> 268.58]  Holy God.
[270.14 --> 290.58]  What other beauty demands such praises? What other splendor outshines the sun? What other majesty rules with justice? Only a holy God.
[290.58 --> 312.12]  Come and behold him, the one and the only. Cry out, sing holy. Forever a holy God. Come and worship the holy God.
[320.58 --> 340.58]  What other glory consumes like fire? What other power can raise the dead? What other name remains undefeated? Only a holy God.
[340.58 --> 361.56]  Come and behold him, the one and the only. Cry out, sing holy. Forever a holy God. Come and worship the holy God.
[361.56 --> 391.54]  Come and worship the holy God.
[391.56 --> 393.56]  Come and worship the holy God.
[393.56 --> 398.56]  Come and worship the holy God. Come and worship the holy God.
[398.56 --> 403.56]  Come and worship the holy God. Come and worship the holy God.
[403.56 --> 413.56]  Who else can rescue me from my failings? Who else could offer his only Son?
[413.56 --> 422.56]  Who else can worship the holy God? Who else invite me to call him Father? Only a holy God.
[422.56 --> 427.56]  Only a holy God. Only my holy God. Come and behold him, the one and the only. Cry out, sing holy. Forever a holy God.
[427.56 --> 436.10]  Come and behold Him, the one and the only.
[436.72 --> 443.58]  Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[443.58 --> 447.68]  Come and worship the holy God.
[447.86 --> 451.80]  Come and worship the holy God.
[457.56 --> 476.72]  Come and behold Him, the one and the only.
[476.72 --> 484.86]  Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[484.86 --> 489.86]  Come and worship the holy God.
[489.86 --> 496.86]  Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[496.86 --> 503.86]  Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[503.86 --> 511.86]  Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[511.86 --> 517.08]  You give life, you are love.
[517.28 --> 521.32]  You bring light to the darkness.
[521.70 --> 529.72]  You give hope, you restore every heart that is broken.
[529.72 --> 536.72]  And great are you, Lord.
[536.72 --> 542.04]  It's your breath in our mouths.
[542.04 --> 544.76]  So we pour out our praise.
[545.04 --> 546.58]  Pour out our praise.
[546.66 --> 550.14]  It's your breath in our mouths.
[550.46 --> 554.42]  So we pour out our praise to you only.
[554.42 --> 566.26]  You give life, you are love.
[566.26 --> 570.44]  You bring light to the darkness.
[570.44 --> 578.56]  You give hope, you restore every heart that is broken.
[578.56 --> 580.56]  You give life, you are love.
[580.56 --> 581.56]  You give faith, you are love.
[581.56 --> 585.54]  And great are you, Lord.
[585.54 --> 590.56]  It's your breath in our mouths.
[590.56 --> 593.00]  So we pour out our praise.
[593.00 --> 594.72]  Pour out our praise.
[594.72 --> 597.56]  It's your breath in our mouths.
[597.56 --> 601.56]  So we pour out our praise to you only.
[601.56 --> 618.56]  It's your breath in our lungs, so we pour out our praise, pour out our praise. It's your breath in our lungs, so we pour out our praise to you only.
[631.56 --> 649.56]  And all the earth will shout your praise, our hearts will cry, these bones will sing, great are you Lord.
[649.56 --> 664.56]  And all the earth will shout your praise, our hearts will cry, these bones will sing, great are you Lord.
[664.56 --> 678.56]  And all the earth will shout your praise, our hearts will cry, these bones will sing, great are you Lord.
[678.56 --> 687.56]  It's your breath in our lungs, so we pour out our praise, pour out our praise.
[687.56 --> 694.56]  It's your breath in our lungs, so we pour out our praise to you only.
[694.56 --> 699.56]  You may be seated.
[699.56 --> 723.56]  You may be seated.
[723.56 --> 738.56]  Our confession this morning is based on an Augustine confession from the 14th century.
[738.56 --> 741.56]  Please pray with me.
[741.56 --> 743.56]  Lord hear my prayer.
[743.56 --> 748.56]  Do not let my soul grow weary under your loving discipline.
[748.56 --> 753.56]  And do not let me lose heart as I confess your mercies.
[753.56 --> 759.56]  You have drawn me out of destructive paths and turned my heart toward you,
[759.56 --> 766.56]  so that you have become my delight above every lesser thing I once chased.
[766.56 --> 773.56]  Help me to love you with my whole heart, and to cling to you with all my affection.
[773.56 --> 780.56]  Rescue me from every temptation, and keep me in your care to the very end.
[780.56 --> 790.56]  O Lord, my King and my God, take whatever gifts I learned in my youth, and use them in your service.
[790.56 --> 796.56]  My speaking, my reading, my writing, my learning.
[796.56 --> 801.56]  You trained me even when I was pursuing what was empty.
[801.56 --> 805.56]  And you have forgiven me for taking pleasure in what was vain.
[805.56 --> 813.56]  You taught me many useful things, yet there is a better and safer path for our steps,
[813.56 --> 817.56]  to learn all things in the light of your truth.
[817.56 --> 824.56]  Lord have mercy on us. Amen.
[824.56 --> 826.56]  I invite you to rise while we sing this song.
[826.56 --> 847.56]  When I fear my faith will fail, Christ will hold me fast.
[847.56 --> 855.56]  When the tempter would prevail, He will hold me fast.
[855.56 --> 863.56]  I could never keep my hold through life's faithful love.
[863.56 --> 872.56]  For my love is often cold, He will hold me fast.
[872.56 --> 873.56]  He will hold me fast.
[873.56 --> 876.56]  He will hold me fast.
[876.56 --> 880.56]  He will hold me fast.
[880.56 --> 884.56]  For my Savior loves me so.
[884.56 --> 889.56]  He will hold me fast.
[889.56 --> 897.56]  He will hold me fast.
[897.56 --> 901.56]  Those He saves are His delight.
[901.56 --> 904.56]  Christ will hold me fast.
[904.56 --> 912.56]  Precious in His holy sight, He will hold me fast.
[912.56 --> 916.56]  He'll not let my soul be lost.
[916.56 --> 920.56]  His promises shall last.
[920.56 --> 929.56]  But by Him at such a cost, He will hold me fast.
[929.56 --> 936.56]  One of the most beautiful descriptions of God, repeated in the Bible, is,
[936.56 --> 940.56]  you are a forgiving God.
[940.56 --> 945.56]  You are a forgiving God, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, and abounding in love.
[945.56 --> 948.56]  He holds us fast because He forgives us.
[948.56 --> 953.56]  He forgives us because He is gracious and compassionate.
[953.56 --> 960.56]  God is gracious and compassionate because He is abounding in love.
[960.56 --> 965.56]  He will hold me fast.
[965.56 --> 968.56]  He will hold me fast.
[968.56 --> 972.56]  For my Savior loves me so.
[972.56 --> 985.56]  He will hold me fast.
[985.56 --> 989.56]  For my life He bled and died.
[989.56 --> 992.56]  Christ will hold me fast.
[992.56 --> 997.56]  Justice has been satisfied.
[997.56 --> 999.56]  He will hold me fast.
[999.56 --> 1000.56]  He will hold me fast.
[1000.56 --> 1004.56]  Raised with Him to endless life.
[1004.56 --> 1008.56]  He will hold me fast.
[1008.56 --> 1013.56]  Till our faith is turned to sight.
[1013.56 --> 1018.56]  When He comes at last.
[1018.56 --> 1021.56]  He will hold me fast.
[1021.56 --> 1024.56]  He will hold me fast.
[1024.56 --> 1028.56]  For my Savior loves me so.
[1028.56 --> 1029.56]  He will hold me fast.
[1029.56 --> 1030.56]  He will hold me fast.
[1030.56 --> 1035.56]  He will hold me fast.
[1035.56 --> 1041.56]  He will hold me fast.
[1041.56 --> 1045.56]  For my Savior loves me so.
[1045.56 --> 1050.56]  He will hold me fast.
[1058.56 --> 1059.56]  Good morning.
[1059.56 --> 1066.56]  My name is Mike and I serve on the Deacon team here for Langley Emanuel.
[1066.56 --> 1072.56]  And before we highlight the offering this morning, I just want to give an update on behalf of Jody and Uriel Gonzalez.
[1072.56 --> 1076.56]  They are our missionaries in the Tijuana area of Mexico.
[1076.56 --> 1082.56]  And they serve with some ladies ministries and with a rehab center for men.
[1082.56 --> 1086.56]  Anyway, as many of you know, they had a bit of a washout of their property.
[1086.56 --> 1090.56]  So our church has been helping them with some of the finances to restore that.
[1090.56 --> 1092.56]  So things are on their way.
[1092.56 --> 1094.56]  And they recently had a lot of rain again.
[1094.56 --> 1095.56]  And the property has held up.
[1095.56 --> 1096.56]  So that's great.
[1096.56 --> 1098.56]  And the excavation has been done.
[1098.56 --> 1105.56]  And they've been able to buy some rebar and other supplies to get going on this pretty big wall that will help maintain the property.
[1105.56 --> 1109.56]  So just a huge thank you on behalf of the deacons for the generosity of this church.
[1109.56 --> 1115.56]  And we'll try to get some photos and maybe a little update from Jody and Uriel themselves.
[1115.56 --> 1117.56]  In an upcoming email.
[1117.56 --> 1119.56]  So stay tuned for that.
[1119.56 --> 1124.56]  So this morning we're going to take a moment to give of the gifts that God has given us financially.
[1124.56 --> 1128.56]  And of course you can always give to the budget of the church and its ministries.
[1128.56 --> 1131.56]  And if you want to do that this morning, just make sure you designate it as such.
[1131.56 --> 1136.56]  Either with the little envelopes or mark it as such when you send an e-transfer or whatever.
[1136.56 --> 1141.56]  Otherwise, all other donations this morning will go towards the Seafarers Ministry.
[1141.56 --> 1149.56]  And the Seafarers Ministry is a quiet but powerful little ministry that operates out of the two ports here in Vancouver.
[1149.56 --> 1155.56]  It was started in 1970 by the CRC church and there's a strong partnership with the Anglican church now.
[1155.56 --> 1167.56]  But what happens is there's some chaplains and pastors who are employed by the ministry and they visit the hundreds of seafaring people that work on a lot of the ships that come in and out of the ports.
[1167.56 --> 1170.56]  And they actually spend a lot of their time going on to the boats.
[1170.56 --> 1173.56]  They'll go up to the, I think their website was saying up to about 40 a month.
[1173.56 --> 1179.56]  They'll visit to have services, counselling, give an encouraging word.
[1179.56 --> 1189.56]  They also operate a couple of centres where some of these seas faring folk can come out and take a break and have some wifi and connect with people and have coffee and whatever.
[1189.56 --> 1195.56]  So it's a strong ministry and there's a great need there for some of these people that live on these boats months on end.
[1195.56 --> 1199.56]  So thank you for giving of your gifts towards that ministry this morning.
[1225.56 --> 1227.56]  Thank you for opening your wish.
[1227.56 --> 1229.56]  All to Jesus the sermonispuffs.
[1229.56 --> 1236.56]  All to Jesus I surrender, all to Him I freely give.
[1236.56 --> 1247.06]  I will never love and trust Him in His presence daily live.
[1247.06 --> 1267.22]  I surrender all, I surrender all, all to thee my blessed Savior, I surrender all.
[1267.22 --> 1288.12]  All to Jesus I surrender, only at his feet I bow, worldly pleasures all forsaken, take me Jesus, take me now.
[1288.12 --> 1307.12]  I surrender all, I surrender all, all to thee my blessed Savior, I surrender all.
[1307.12 --> 1329.18]  All to Jesus I surrender, make me Savior, holy thine, let me feel thy Holy Spirit, truly know that thou art mine.
[1329.18 --> 1338.18]  I surrender all, I surrender all.
[1339.18 --> 1348.18]  All to thee my blessed Savior, I surrender all.
[1348.18 --> 1358.18]  I surrender all, I surrender all.
[1358.18 --> 1368.18]  All to thee my blessed Savior, I surrender all.
[1378.18 --> 1384.04]  Okay, can we have all the kids up here for children's worship or kids' corner?
[1384.34 --> 1385.04]  Come on up.
[1400.18 --> 1403.06]  You think I can get a loud good morning out of you guys?
[1403.20 --> 1403.62]  How about it?
[1403.78 --> 1404.32]  Good morning.
[1404.64 --> 1406.18]  Good morning.
[1406.18 --> 1406.54]  Good morning.
[1406.66 --> 1407.32]  That's pretty good.
[1407.36 --> 1408.04]  How's things going?
[1408.10 --> 1409.66]  How's life going for you guys?
[1409.78 --> 1410.08]  Good?
[1411.46 --> 1413.88]  Is life pretty tough being a kid or not?
[1414.88 --> 1415.34]  Sometimes?
[1415.34 --> 1415.54]  Sometimes?
[1415.94 --> 1423.02]  Do you think that if you just listen to your parents, obey your parents and follow the rules,
[1423.12 --> 1425.64]  everything goes pretty slick, pretty good at home?
[1426.96 --> 1427.34]  Yeah?
[1427.56 --> 1433.24]  Some head nods, some aren't very sure, some don't really follow those expectations maybe.
[1433.24 --> 1439.24]  Today, is it Pastor Chris or Kevin this morning?
[1439.56 --> 1444.42]  Pastor Chris is going to continue, I think it's the last passage of Ecclesiastes.
[1444.62 --> 1446.86]  Now, I was going to do this with you guys last time.
[1447.52 --> 1450.70]  This is like one of the most difficult books in the Bible to say the word.
[1450.76 --> 1453.04]  Can everybody in this group here say Ecclesiastes?
[1455.38 --> 1458.60]  Wow, the education system is doing real good here in BC.
[1458.60 --> 1459.52]  That's great.
[1461.54 --> 1465.82]  What we're going to talk about today, has anything ever happened in your life that you thought,
[1465.90 --> 1469.64]  oh, I was super excited about, but afterwards it wasn't really that big of a deal?
[1470.22 --> 1471.30]  Can you think of anything?
[1472.10 --> 1472.56]  Maybe?
[1473.50 --> 1478.74]  How about like you're really, really excited about the Canucks to win, but then the next
[1478.74 --> 1480.44]  day it was no big deal?
[1481.50 --> 1481.82]  Yeah?
[1482.16 --> 1482.42]  Yeah.
[1482.42 --> 1485.22]  How about when the Blue Jays were playing?
[1485.32 --> 1487.50]  Did anybody, didn't you guys watch the Blue Jays, the baseball?
[1487.68 --> 1488.64]  Yeah, was that pretty cool?
[1488.74 --> 1492.86]  We were super excited about wanting them to win, but then the next day was it, it was okay,
[1492.94 --> 1493.92]  we kind of got over it.
[1494.04 --> 1494.60]  Was that good?
[1494.64 --> 1496.48]  Or some people not over it yet.
[1497.50 --> 1497.86]  Chris?
[1499.58 --> 1500.40]  Still hurts.
[1500.40 --> 1505.90]  So basically what we're going to talk about today in children's worship time, there's
[1505.90 --> 1509.98]  a lot of things that happen in life, but most, everything is pretty much not that important
[1509.98 --> 1511.86]  as long as we trust and obey God.
[1512.40 --> 1515.60]  And what we're going to do in children's worship time is we're going to use a little bit of
[1515.60 --> 1517.92]  analogy, we're going to have some fun with bubbles back there.
[1518.00 --> 1519.06]  Do you guys know what bubbles are?
[1519.16 --> 1520.42]  You know, little bubbles?
[1520.48 --> 1521.02]  I'm sure you do.
[1522.02 --> 1522.36]  Okay.
[1524.60 --> 1526.04]  Let's stand up and do the blessing.
[1526.04 --> 1526.72]  Shall we do that?
[1530.40 --> 1531.20]  This way.
[1531.80 --> 1532.26]  You guys ready?
[1532.94 --> 1533.30]  Love.
[1533.76 --> 1534.94]  All in the world.
[1535.32 --> 1536.10]  All in the world.
[1536.18 --> 1537.52]  And also with you.
[1537.52 --> 1566.38]  So today, I think, or around this time, marks five years that Pastor Chris and Rachel and
[1566.38 --> 1568.28]  family have been with us.
[1569.32 --> 1571.44]  So I'd like to ask them to come up.
[1577.00 --> 1578.12]  Kids are coming up too.
[1578.24 --> 1578.40]  Good.
[1586.82 --> 1592.82]  So I'm going to do this off the cuff, which is dangerous, because that's why I always write
[1592.82 --> 1595.90]  out all my prayers, because I'm not very good at that.
[1596.04 --> 1600.10]  But we want to thank you for being here.
[1602.10 --> 1607.68]  It's evident, I think, that God has put you here.
[1607.68 --> 1616.12]  Times like this, I guess it's tempting to praise the pastor.
[1617.50 --> 1625.46]  But we know that the Spirit is with you, and your leading here is much appreciated.
[1628.90 --> 1630.06]  That's a little token.
[1630.06 --> 1643.24]  Romans 10 says, everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
[1645.08 --> 1650.00]  Now then, can they call on the one that they have not believed in?
[1650.00 --> 1656.28]  And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard?
[1657.76 --> 1661.14]  And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?
[1662.58 --> 1666.04]  And how can anyone preach unless they are sent?
[1667.32 --> 1671.46]  As it is written, how beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news.
[1671.46 --> 1672.46]  Amen.
[1674.66 --> 1675.44]  All right.
[1676.98 --> 1677.60]  Thank you.
[1678.68 --> 1679.98]  I always knew I had beautiful feet.
[1683.68 --> 1689.12]  I'd like the council to come up and surround them as we pray.
[1701.46 --> 1715.32]  Heavenly Father, we praise your name, and we humbly stand here before you
[1715.32 --> 1724.02]  to thank you for our pastor, knowing that you walk beside him day by day.
[1724.24 --> 1728.40]  Lord, we ask that you continue to strengthen him, Rachel, and his family.
[1728.40 --> 1737.16]  Lord, we ask that you bless them in their work so that we, together, as a family, as Emmanuel CRC,
[1737.36 --> 1741.96]  can stand as a light to this world around us.
[1742.94 --> 1745.32]  We pray these things in your heavenly name.
[1745.66 --> 1745.92]  Amen.
[1745.92 --> 1746.04]  Amen.
[1752.10 --> 1756.24]  Afterwards, after church, will be cake.
[1756.24 --> 1760.26]  So please join us in the celebration.
[1767.26 --> 1769.86]  Good morning.
[1770.34 --> 1772.80]  I'm Frank, one of the pastoral elders here.
[1773.30 --> 1776.86]  This morning, I have the privilege to lead us in a congregational prayer.
[1777.52 --> 1782.94]  Of course, all of us have heard that we have our annual fall budget meeting tomorrow evening.
[1782.94 --> 1786.92]  And also, there is the Tri Soup Tournament.
[1787.92 --> 1791.28]  This is a potluck soup dinner, which you are all welcome to attend.
[1792.02 --> 1796.24]  I know there are a few competitors that are very much vying to win this,
[1796.32 --> 1798.18]  and there's great competition between them.
[1798.68 --> 1802.44]  That starts at 6 o'clock, and the meeting starts at 7.
[1802.44 --> 1806.38]  Let us go before God in prayer.
[1808.90 --> 1816.96]  Heavenly Father, our Creator, Jesus, our Redeemer, Holy Spirit, our Sustainer,
[1817.46 --> 1822.06]  we come before you this day to thank you and praise you,
[1822.06 --> 1831.36]  also to bring our thanks and concerns, troubles and sorrows that are here in our community and abroad.
[1832.28 --> 1838.04]  As we are entering this winter season of celebration of Christmas,
[1839.08 --> 1844.68]  we ask that we keep it in the perspective of what it is and what it's all about,
[1844.68 --> 1849.84]  and not all about commercialism that a lot of the world makes of it.
[1851.26 --> 1854.48]  Let us rejoice in the coming of Jesus to this world
[1854.48 --> 1859.80]  to sacrifice himself so the relationship that mankind destroyed
[1859.80 --> 1862.58]  is able to be restored.
[1864.42 --> 1869.20]  Father, as we hear the world news of wars, conflicts,
[1869.68 --> 1872.58]  and the greed for control and power,
[1872.58 --> 1875.52]  as it seems to be getting worse every day.
[1876.76 --> 1879.82]  Father, change the hearts and minds of the world leaders
[1879.82 --> 1884.18]  to realize where their power and strength comes from.
[1885.64 --> 1888.54]  Lord, also be with all the victims of these conflicts
[1888.54 --> 1891.70]  and grant them healing and peace.
[1892.42 --> 1893.72]  Lord, hear our prayer.
[1895.46 --> 1898.54]  Lord, in this community of Emmanuel there are many blessings.
[1898.54 --> 1902.70]  We thank you for being with Pastor Chris, Rachel, Nora, and Malachi
[1902.70 --> 1906.00]  for the five years they have already served here.
[1907.08 --> 1911.12]  Continue to bless them as family and also in Chris's ministry.
[1912.36 --> 1916.44]  Father, we are thankful for the gifts of servant leadership here at Emmanuel.
[1917.58 --> 1920.12]  Bless these efforts of everyone involved.
[1921.12 --> 1923.66]  Be with those that are still looking for their place here
[1923.66 --> 1928.28]  of where they can be helping hands with the gifts you have given them.
[1929.30 --> 1930.96]  Nourish them with your spirit.
[1932.66 --> 1936.44]  Lord, we bring before you Andy Emmons, who had eye surgery this past week.
[1937.32 --> 1940.90]  We pray for a complete healing of his eye, which may take a bit of time.
[1941.48 --> 1942.90]  Grant patience and peace.
[1942.90 --> 1948.46]  Be with Joanne Miles, who will have thyroid surgery tomorrow morning.
[1949.34 --> 1952.44]  Bless these skills of the surgeon and grant a successful surgery
[1952.44 --> 1953.72]  and a time of recovery.
[1955.16 --> 1957.74]  Father, be with the families that are expecting children
[1957.74 --> 1959.62]  in the next number of months.
[1960.72 --> 1962.64]  Bless these pregnancies with healthy children.
[1964.30 --> 1968.06]  Lord, nourish all the families with your spirit that we have.
[1968.68 --> 1970.28]  May they live in harmony with you.
[1970.28 --> 1975.42]  Where there are struggles or broken relationships,
[1975.84 --> 1978.24]  please, Father, grant healing and peace.
[1979.50 --> 1982.14]  Be with everyone who suffers from seasonal depression
[1982.14 --> 1983.62]  or spiritual struggles.
[1984.92 --> 1987.28]  Grant a good measure of your spirit in their lives
[1987.28 --> 1989.34]  so that they are able to have peace again.
[1991.10 --> 1994.98]  Father, be with John Kuypers as he is still waiting for answers for his condition.
[1995.84 --> 1997.60]  Bless John with patience and peace,
[1997.70 --> 1999.50]  knowing everything is in God's timing.
[2000.28 --> 2003.54]  Father, we ask for a blessing for our aging membership.
[2004.44 --> 2006.08]  Bless them in this time of their life.
[2007.30 --> 2009.96]  Help them with the physical or other struggles that can appear.
[2010.54 --> 2013.60]  As they age, bless them and also be with their caregivers.
[2014.56 --> 2016.86]  Grant them all with what they are in need of.
[2018.02 --> 2019.66]  Lord, as we look around us,
[2019.72 --> 2021.74]  we are witnessing a lot more homelessness.
[2021.74 --> 2028.10]  And those in need stir in us the desire to be the helping hands that these children of yours need.
[2029.60 --> 2032.82]  We ask, Father, for a good congregational meeting tomorrow night.
[2033.54 --> 2035.84]  Let every member be able to attend this meeting
[2035.84 --> 2038.82]  and see they're responsible for these matters of this church.
[2038.82 --> 2043.18]  Father, we ask for a blessing for the seafarers' ministry.
[2043.18 --> 2049.06]  Let this be a helping hand in all the lives of those that work on these ships that travel the world.
[2049.92 --> 2052.40]  Help all these workers stay close to you
[2052.40 --> 2057.42]  and true to their families when they are separated from loved ones for extended periods of time.
[2058.62 --> 2061.10]  Lord, bless the message of Pastor Chris this morning.
[2061.34 --> 2064.32]  Open our hearts and minds to the understanding of your words,
[2064.62 --> 2065.48]  which we will hear.
[2065.48 --> 2069.04]  Father, we ask you to hear our prayer.
[2069.28 --> 2070.48]  In Jesus' name, amen.
[2090.48 --> 2094.14]  Before I open the word for us,
[2094.14 --> 2097.88]  let me just say thank you for that, Paul,
[2098.02 --> 2102.24]  and council and members for those words of encouragement.
[2102.88 --> 2104.76]  As I reflect back on five years here,
[2104.86 --> 2107.86]  sometimes I think about those COVID years and I go,
[2108.00 --> 2110.88]  man, that felt like five years in itself.
[2111.72 --> 2114.62]  And then I think now it's been five years and it feels like yesterday.
[2115.30 --> 2121.20]  And I want to thank you for your constant support and encouragement and prayers.
[2121.74 --> 2123.58]  And I know this is true not just for myself,
[2123.58 --> 2126.40]  but for the other staff, for Josh and for Kevin.
[2126.92 --> 2129.88]  We feel very encouraged in the work that we get to do.
[2129.96 --> 2132.78]  And it is a distinct privilege to serve you.
[2132.92 --> 2134.88]  And so thank you for allowing us that privilege
[2134.88 --> 2136.80]  and supporting us with your prayers.
[2138.40 --> 2141.62]  Here's to five and many more years, the Lord willing.
[2141.62 --> 2148.48]  We're going to read this morning from Ecclesiastes 12.
[2148.96 --> 2155.28]  This is the last message in our series through the book of Ecclesiastes.
[2155.46 --> 2157.60]  I'm going to read the first eight verses.
[2158.38 --> 2160.68]  I encourage you to have that open in front of you
[2160.68 --> 2164.68]  and then to keep it open as we will refer back later.
[2164.68 --> 2167.48]  From Ecclesiastes 12.
[2170.02 --> 2173.58]  Remember your creator in the days of your youth.
[2174.60 --> 2178.16]  Before the days of trouble come and the years approach
[2178.16 --> 2180.92]  when you will say, I find no pleasure in them.
[2182.20 --> 2185.84]  Before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars grow dark
[2185.84 --> 2188.52]  and the clouds return after the rain.
[2188.52 --> 2193.32]  When the keepers of the house tremble and the strong men stoop.
[2194.44 --> 2196.98]  When the grinders cease because they are few
[2196.98 --> 2200.40]  and those looking through the windows grow dim.
[2201.18 --> 2205.04]  When the doors to the street are closed and the sound of grinding fades.
[2205.30 --> 2208.14]  When the people rise up at the sound of the birds,
[2208.42 --> 2210.16]  but all their songs grow faint.
[2210.96 --> 2214.14]  When people are afraid of heights and of dangers in the streets.
[2214.14 --> 2218.34]  When the almond tree blossoms and the grasshopper drags itself along.
[2218.52 --> 2220.94]  And desire no longer is stirred.
[2221.44 --> 2225.86]  Then people go to their eternal home and mourners go about the streets.
[2227.18 --> 2232.38]  Remember him before the silver cord is severed and the golden bowl is broken.
[2232.68 --> 2237.80]  Before the pitcher is shattered at the spring and the wheel broken at the well.
[2238.22 --> 2241.62]  And the dust returns to the ground it came from.
[2241.62 --> 2245.20]  And the spirit returns to God who gave it.
[2245.20 --> 2246.20]  Meaningless.
[2246.20 --> 2246.88]  Meaningless.
[2246.88 --> 2247.20]  Meaningless.
[2247.20 --> 2248.20]  Meaningless.
[2248.20 --> 2249.20]  Meaningless.
[2249.20 --> 2249.96]  Says the teacher.
[2249.96 --> 2253.76]  Everything is meaningless.
[2253.76 --> 2256.30]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2256.30 --> 2266.18]  I know that this has happened in my house and in my family.
[2266.18 --> 2269.06]  I know it happened when I was a kid as well.
[2269.06 --> 2275.92]  But have you ever watched a child open a present on their birthday or at Christmas?
[2276.56 --> 2278.16]  They tear off the paper.
[2278.72 --> 2280.82]  They lift the lid of the box.
[2281.64 --> 2284.50]  And then they dump it out and spend the next 20 minutes playing with the box.
[2286.36 --> 2286.74]  Right?
[2286.80 --> 2290.22]  There's this shiny new toy that you have searched for.
[2290.80 --> 2291.96]  That you have saved.
[2292.06 --> 2294.60]  That you have wrapped with care and love.
[2294.60 --> 2299.26]  And then they toss it to the side because the box is going to make a better target for your bow and arrow.
[2300.78 --> 2301.86]  That one's personal.
[2305.12 --> 2305.54]  Right?
[2305.60 --> 2306.34]  It's funny.
[2306.50 --> 2307.20]  It's innocent.
[2307.54 --> 2308.86]  But it's also familiar.
[2310.50 --> 2318.44]  I want to suggest to you that as adults, we just get better at making the box look more sophisticated.
[2318.44 --> 2320.66]  But we do the same thing.
[2321.82 --> 2322.26]  Right?
[2322.30 --> 2327.86]  We take the gifts of youth, whether it's energy or opportunity or beauty, strength or freedom,
[2327.86 --> 2331.12]  and we fix our hearts on the box.
[2331.28 --> 2332.58]  We chase the wrapping.
[2333.08 --> 2337.62]  We cling to the stuff that was never meant to hold the weight of our joy.
[2339.44 --> 2345.54]  But then, every now and again, something happens that shakes us awake.
[2345.54 --> 2354.32]  A moment when the light in the room shifts and we see for just a second how fragile everything is.
[2354.74 --> 2359.46]  How tentatively held together the careful life that we have crafted.
[2359.76 --> 2360.74]  That can be a diagnosis.
[2361.28 --> 2363.66]  It can be a sudden change in someone you love.
[2363.76 --> 2369.38]  It can be a conversation that you've had that reminds you that time is slipping away faster than you thought.
[2369.46 --> 2372.08]  It can be an anniversary celebration when you look back and go,
[2372.18 --> 2372.44]  Really?
[2372.92 --> 2373.60]  Five years?
[2373.60 --> 2373.68]  Five years?
[2374.20 --> 2379.76]  It's a moment that you wish you could freeze because you know that you won't get it back.
[2381.18 --> 2387.34]  And it's exactly this collision, the innocence of the cardboard box joy,
[2387.56 --> 2396.32]  and the ache of life's fading light that Ecclesiastes 12 is setting before us this morning.
[2396.32 --> 2403.08]  Youth and delight on one side and shadows lengthening at the other.
[2403.78 --> 2408.92]  A picture of the world where rejoicing is real but temporary.
[2408.92 --> 2413.84]  Where life is beautiful but breakable.
[2415.38 --> 2418.56]  And into that tension, the teacher says,
[2419.36 --> 2424.10]  Before the box falls apart, before the house crumbles, before the doors swing shut,
[2424.46 --> 2429.82]  the sound of life grows faint, remember your creator.
[2429.82 --> 2436.48]  When we move past the cardboard box simplicity of childhood,
[2436.48 --> 2441.26]  or when we look at the ways that we get really good at dressing up the box,
[2442.08 --> 2443.96]  pretending it's something else,
[2444.32 --> 2447.82]  we discover, I pray, beneath that and in that,
[2447.90 --> 2453.88]  a deep ache that is humming under the surface of our lives.
[2453.88 --> 2456.70]  Ecclesiastes names it for us,
[2456.80 --> 2462.26]  that we are creatures who long for what we cannot hold.
[2463.78 --> 2466.98]  And so we long to stay young, right?
[2467.00 --> 2469.46]  Even if we don't say it out loud, we feel it.
[2470.16 --> 2473.54]  We feel it when we see an old photo and we whisper,
[2474.00 --> 2475.30]  What happened to my hairline?
[2476.70 --> 2478.60]  We see it when we look in the mirror,
[2478.60 --> 2483.94]  or when someone we love suddenly looks older than when we remember.
[2485.30 --> 2488.96]  Something inside of us pushes back and says,
[2489.06 --> 2490.30]  I'm not ready for this yet.
[2491.46 --> 2494.88]  And our world wants to rush into that ache,
[2495.14 --> 2498.62]  into that realization to soothe it and to calm it.
[2498.84 --> 2500.94]  And so we have anti-aging everything.
[2501.68 --> 2503.82]  I turned 40 two years ago.
[2503.96 --> 2506.68]  My Instagram feed shifted immediately.
[2506.68 --> 2510.40]  So you're a man over 40 who wants to lose 30 pounds.
[2511.06 --> 2511.30]  What?
[2511.82 --> 2512.76]  How did you know that?
[2513.88 --> 2515.80]  So your hairline has been receding.
[2516.12 --> 2516.62]  Come on!
[2517.90 --> 2518.12]  Right?
[2518.34 --> 2521.44]  Everything shifted to push back against this.
[2521.56 --> 2523.32]  Wellness rituals, fitness apps,
[2523.66 --> 2526.76]  procedures and products to deny the passage of time.
[2527.00 --> 2529.70]  And beneath it all is this quiet fear.
[2530.64 --> 2532.64]  What if I can't hang on to what I had?
[2532.64 --> 2536.70]  At the same time,
[2536.78 --> 2540.78]  we long for a joy that doesn't collapse under the weight of reality.
[2541.76 --> 2541.86]  Right?
[2541.90 --> 2542.98]  We chase moments,
[2543.18 --> 2545.12]  entertainment and pleasure and vacations,
[2545.32 --> 2546.46]  and the next distraction,
[2546.76 --> 2550.28]  just hoping to stay ahead of the sadness or to outrun the anxiety.
[2551.64 --> 2553.74]  Our culture tells us, of course,
[2553.86 --> 2557.40]  that joy is something that we can achieve
[2557.40 --> 2560.50]  by carefully arranging our circumstances.
[2561.50 --> 2561.64]  Right?
[2561.74 --> 2562.90]  Keep the mood light.
[2563.32 --> 2564.62]  Keep the news off.
[2565.18 --> 2566.74]  Keep the schedule full.
[2567.16 --> 2568.68]  Keep the relationships shallow,
[2568.68 --> 2570.02]  because then you won't get hurt.
[2571.22 --> 2573.34]  But Ecclesiastes doesn't let us pretend.
[2574.78 --> 2574.94]  Right?
[2574.96 --> 2575.64]  It tells the truth.
[2575.72 --> 2576.54]  It says explicitly,
[2576.54 --> 2578.90]  there will be days without pleasure.
[2579.62 --> 2581.56]  Days when distraction fails,
[2581.70 --> 2582.92]  when joy feels thin,
[2583.12 --> 2588.40]  when we realize just how much our happiness is built on things that we cannot control.
[2589.04 --> 2592.50]  Things that can be taken away without any warning.
[2593.72 --> 2598.54]  And we live and long for security in a world that we cannot control.
[2598.54 --> 2603.84]  So we plan, we save, we insure, and we build,
[2604.02 --> 2609.46]  and we do everything we can to construct lives that are safe and predictable.
[2611.30 --> 2613.06]  But then something happens.
[2614.28 --> 2616.96]  Anything, actually, really happens.
[2617.14 --> 2618.28]  The house shakes.
[2618.42 --> 2621.46]  The things that we thought were solid begin to rock.
[2621.66 --> 2625.48]  And suddenly, the limits of our control are exposed.
[2625.48 --> 2628.62]  And our carefully curated construction
[2628.62 --> 2632.30]  that simply doesn't feel secure anymore.
[2633.02 --> 2634.06]  And let me be really clear, right?
[2634.08 --> 2636.32]  Because it's not that planning is wrong.
[2638.22 --> 2640.04]  It just can't protect us
[2640.04 --> 2644.46]  from the fragility that Ecclesiastes is describing.
[2648.28 --> 2652.30]  And here's what I know
[2652.30 --> 2655.34]  and what I think the teacher wants us to see this morning in particular.
[2655.48 --> 2661.92]  That these longings find a particular and a poignant expression
[2661.92 --> 2663.46]  when you are young.
[2664.64 --> 2668.18]  And so here I'm thinking of teenagers and early 20-somethings.
[2668.78 --> 2669.22]  Right?
[2669.30 --> 2673.76]  This poignancy comes precisely because when you're young,
[2673.90 --> 2678.48]  we don't even realize we're operating out of these ideas and assumptions.
[2678.48 --> 2683.80]  A young person doesn't so much long to stay young
[2683.80 --> 2685.54]  as much as they assume they will.
[2687.54 --> 2688.14]  Right?
[2688.26 --> 2690.04]  Psychologists have a word for this.
[2690.16 --> 2692.82]  It's called the invulnerability impulse.
[2693.42 --> 2695.94]  Sometimes it's referred to as the invulnerability complex.
[2695.94 --> 2700.54]  But it's the quiet belief that when you're young,
[2700.80 --> 2702.94]  these bad things happen to other people.
[2703.46 --> 2706.52]  Sickness, loss, limits, even death won't happen to me.
[2707.02 --> 2707.10]  Right?
[2707.38 --> 2709.56]  Youth doesn't imagine fragility.
[2710.10 --> 2712.42]  Youth assumes permanence.
[2712.42 --> 2718.14]  And with that, there's this kind of built-in optimism.
[2719.22 --> 2723.50]  And it's not that young hearts long for a joy that reality can't crush.
[2723.92 --> 2726.84]  For many, reality hasn't crushed that joy.
[2728.30 --> 2731.80]  Life still feels open and full and expandable.
[2732.16 --> 2734.50]  Joy seems natural and not threatened.
[2734.50 --> 2738.58]  The future looks like something that you can seize and shape.
[2740.00 --> 2745.00]  And the same is true when you're in this time of life with security.
[2745.38 --> 2745.50]  Right?
[2745.54 --> 2748.36]  When you're young, you don't lie awake at night
[2748.36 --> 2750.70]  longing for something to protect you from the world.
[2750.92 --> 2755.36]  You assume that you can go out and secure it and shape it and build it.
[2755.98 --> 2758.54]  And if something goes wrong, well, we'll fix it.
[2759.30 --> 2761.58]  If something breaks, we'll rebuild it.
[2761.86 --> 2763.36]  Or maybe we'll replace it.
[2764.50 --> 2767.10]  If a door closes when you're 15,
[2767.46 --> 2769.46]  you'll just find another one to kick open.
[2770.24 --> 2771.26]  That's the way it works.
[2773.16 --> 2774.64]  Now, let me be really clear.
[2775.86 --> 2780.00]  These longings are not themselves foolish.
[2781.48 --> 2781.98]  Right?
[2782.06 --> 2783.98]  They're deeply human.
[2785.10 --> 2787.82]  And when you're young, when you're in this age,
[2788.40 --> 2792.44]  it's developmentally appropriate and necessary.
[2792.44 --> 2793.08]  Right?
[2793.40 --> 2795.48]  We want youth to last.
[2795.58 --> 2796.82]  We want joy to endure.
[2797.26 --> 2799.96]  We want security that doesn't evaporate overnight.
[2801.76 --> 2804.18]  But here's the truth of Ecclesiastes for us.
[2805.18 --> 2806.60]  And every solution,
[2807.40 --> 2808.98]  every fulfillment,
[2809.54 --> 2812.06]  every idea that the world hands us
[2812.06 --> 2814.36]  to solve this, fill this,
[2814.46 --> 2815.96]  to provide meaning,
[2815.96 --> 2817.38]  proves temporary
[2817.38 --> 2819.60]  and thin
[2819.60 --> 2822.14]  and ultimately powerless
[2822.14 --> 2825.00]  to stop the troubles of life from coming.
[2826.32 --> 2828.34]  And there's a particular danger here,
[2828.42 --> 2830.12]  especially when you're young,
[2830.20 --> 2833.96]  when very few bad things have actually happened to you,
[2834.02 --> 2835.80]  when your youth feels endless,
[2836.02 --> 2837.54]  when your joy feels automatic,
[2837.70 --> 2839.92]  when control feels certain,
[2839.92 --> 2842.30]  when you think and feel that way,
[2842.78 --> 2845.46]  God becomes optional.
[2847.00 --> 2848.46]  Not so much rejected,
[2849.36 --> 2850.64]  it's just kind of postponed.
[2852.62 --> 2852.78]  Right?
[2852.90 --> 2855.04]  Faith quietly gets pushed to the edges
[2855.04 --> 2856.72]  of our experience.
[2856.90 --> 2858.30]  Not because we hate God,
[2858.38 --> 2860.28]  not even because we disagree with him,
[2860.38 --> 2863.02]  but because we can't actually imagine needing him.
[2864.38 --> 2864.74]  Right?
[2864.74 --> 2866.28]  When your life feels manageable,
[2867.22 --> 2869.18]  why seek wisdom?
[2870.30 --> 2874.48]  When everything seems to be working
[2874.48 --> 2876.38]  because of your instinct,
[2877.22 --> 2878.42]  why ask for advice?
[2881.34 --> 2883.32]  Why remember your creator
[2883.32 --> 2886.88]  when it feels like you're creating your own life just fine?
[2889.10 --> 2889.30]  Right?
[2889.38 --> 2890.30]  Forgetting God,
[2890.64 --> 2892.30]  especially in our youth,
[2892.42 --> 2894.20]  doesn't always look like rebellion.
[2894.74 --> 2897.24]  It usually looks like distraction.
[2898.90 --> 2899.38]  Right?
[2899.42 --> 2901.66]  It looks like a heart that assumes
[2901.66 --> 2903.42]  there will be time for this later.
[2904.20 --> 2904.64]  Right?
[2904.66 --> 2906.44]  A time to be serious later.
[2906.56 --> 2908.28]  A time to be faithful later.
[2908.40 --> 2911.36]  A time to deal with the big questions of life later.
[2911.46 --> 2913.50]  A time to return to church later.
[2913.62 --> 2916.12]  A time to straighten things out later.
[2917.34 --> 2918.80]  It sounds like,
[2919.32 --> 2920.88]  I'll think about God when I'm older.
[2920.88 --> 2923.50]  Or I'll come back to that
[2923.50 --> 2924.86]  when my life settles down.
[2925.92 --> 2926.78]  And someday,
[2927.06 --> 2928.46]  I'll get serious about faith.
[2931.34 --> 2932.76]  But later
[2932.76 --> 2937.70]  is the most spiritually dangerous word
[2937.70 --> 2940.14]  in your walk with God.
[2940.14 --> 2944.48]  The teacher knows how quickly
[2944.48 --> 2946.28]  habits of remembering
[2946.28 --> 2947.28]  can wither
[2947.28 --> 2948.88]  and dry out.
[2949.60 --> 2951.14]  How easily joy
[2951.14 --> 2952.30]  can latch on
[2952.30 --> 2953.28]  to the gifts
[2953.28 --> 2954.48]  instead of the giver
[2954.48 --> 2955.42]  or to the box
[2955.42 --> 2956.10]  that they come in.
[2956.60 --> 2957.46]  How quietly
[2957.46 --> 2958.78]  pride can take root
[2958.78 --> 2960.52]  when life seems to be working out.
[2960.52 --> 2962.04]  And how the slow drift
[2962.04 --> 2962.96]  of forgetting God
[2962.96 --> 2964.36]  doesn't feel like a crisis,
[2964.72 --> 2966.34]  just feels like normal life.
[2966.34 --> 2968.70]  which is why
[2968.70 --> 2969.92]  precisely
[2969.92 --> 2970.94]  Ecclesiastes
[2970.94 --> 2971.98]  and the teacher here
[2971.98 --> 2974.36]  interrupts this moment
[2974.36 --> 2975.86]  with urgency.
[2976.76 --> 2977.96]  Not with fear,
[2978.44 --> 2979.50]  but with urgency.
[2980.32 --> 2981.66]  A sense of right now.
[2982.44 --> 2984.14]  Remember your creator
[2984.14 --> 2985.18]  before.
[2985.84 --> 2987.44]  Before the illusions fade.
[2987.58 --> 2988.60]  Before the days change.
[2988.72 --> 2989.80]  Before life grows harder
[2989.80 --> 2990.58]  than you expect.
[2990.92 --> 2992.00]  Before the moment passes
[2992.00 --> 2993.32]  and doesn't come back again.
[2993.32 --> 2996.80]  Because forgetting God
[2996.80 --> 2997.68]  is easy,
[2998.56 --> 2999.66]  remembering him
[2999.66 --> 3000.84]  must be learned.
[3002.54 --> 3003.24]  And that's exactly
[3003.24 --> 3003.98]  where the teacher
[3003.98 --> 3005.36]  turns our attention.
[3006.78 --> 3008.24]  He doesn't shame youth.
[3008.86 --> 3009.62]  He doesn't scold
[3009.62 --> 3010.46]  our longings
[3010.46 --> 3011.32]  for joy
[3011.32 --> 3012.12]  or for security.
[3012.48 --> 3013.24]  He simply
[3013.24 --> 3014.50]  tells us the truth
[3014.50 --> 3015.52]  about life
[3015.52 --> 3016.40]  under the sun.
[3017.34 --> 3018.36]  And then he gives
[3018.36 --> 3019.44]  the only response
[3019.44 --> 3020.10]  that can actually
[3020.10 --> 3021.00]  bear the weight
[3021.00 --> 3022.32]  of our longings.
[3023.32 --> 3024.58]  If forgetting God
[3024.58 --> 3025.34]  is easy,
[3025.76 --> 3027.22]  then remembering him
[3027.22 --> 3029.06]  must become intentional.
[3029.74 --> 3030.82]  It must become
[3030.82 --> 3031.78]  the very shape
[3031.78 --> 3033.30]  of our lives.
[3034.72 --> 3035.94]  And so the teacher
[3035.94 --> 3037.48]  draws a line
[3037.48 --> 3038.08]  in the sand
[3038.08 --> 3039.34]  and he says,
[3039.58 --> 3040.58]  let me show you
[3040.58 --> 3041.74]  what remembering
[3041.74 --> 3042.60]  your creator
[3042.60 --> 3043.80]  really means.
[3044.48 --> 3045.04]  And why it's
[3045.04 --> 3045.92]  the only way
[3045.92 --> 3047.08]  to live wisely
[3047.08 --> 3049.06]  before life fades.
[3049.92 --> 3050.96]  And the command
[3050.96 --> 3051.52]  is simple,
[3051.68 --> 3052.16]  but the weight
[3052.16 --> 3052.84]  behind it
[3052.84 --> 3053.72]  is enormous.
[3054.46 --> 3054.58]  Right?
[3054.66 --> 3056.06]  Remember your creator
[3056.06 --> 3057.18]  in the days
[3057.18 --> 3058.26]  of your youth.
[3058.74 --> 3059.22]  And like we said,
[3059.28 --> 3059.92]  he repeats it
[3059.92 --> 3060.62]  with urgency.
[3061.10 --> 3061.78]  Remember him
[3061.78 --> 3063.08]  when and when
[3063.08 --> 3063.66]  and when.
[3063.82 --> 3064.58]  Remember him
[3064.58 --> 3066.10]  before and before
[3066.10 --> 3067.04]  and before.
[3068.64 --> 3070.32]  And let me be
[3070.32 --> 3071.36]  really clear with you.
[3072.08 --> 3073.06]  To remember
[3073.06 --> 3074.58]  in the Bible
[3074.58 --> 3076.24]  is more than
[3076.24 --> 3077.42]  just a call
[3077.42 --> 3078.12]  to mind.
[3078.74 --> 3079.82]  It's more than
[3079.82 --> 3081.16]  just a looking back.
[3081.16 --> 3082.12]  In the Bible
[3082.12 --> 3082.94]  to remember
[3082.94 --> 3084.50]  is covenantal.
[3084.76 --> 3085.24]  And what that means
[3085.24 --> 3086.64]  is it's relationship
[3086.64 --> 3088.84]  and worship filled.
[3089.72 --> 3090.28]  To remember
[3090.28 --> 3091.32]  is the movement
[3091.32 --> 3092.02]  of heart
[3092.02 --> 3092.88]  of your heart
[3092.88 --> 3094.16]  towards God
[3094.16 --> 3094.94]  in trust
[3094.94 --> 3096.02]  and faith.
[3096.46 --> 3097.06]  To remember
[3097.06 --> 3098.94]  is living daily
[3098.94 --> 3100.00]  with God
[3100.00 --> 3100.86]  at the center
[3100.86 --> 3101.92]  rather than
[3101.92 --> 3102.60]  at the margins.
[3103.26 --> 3104.10]  To remember
[3104.10 --> 3106.10]  is not looking
[3106.10 --> 3107.14]  to the past
[3107.14 --> 3107.74]  so much
[3107.74 --> 3108.36]  as it is
[3108.36 --> 3109.60]  faith in action
[3109.60 --> 3110.52]  now
[3110.52 --> 3112.00]  for the future
[3112.00 --> 3112.82]  because
[3112.82 --> 3114.76]  of the past.
[3115.84 --> 3116.90]  The teacher
[3116.90 --> 3117.90]  is saying to you
[3117.90 --> 3119.20]  and especially
[3119.20 --> 3120.26]  if you are young
[3120.26 --> 3122.16]  live your life
[3122.16 --> 3122.86]  now
[3122.86 --> 3124.36]  while you're still
[3124.36 --> 3124.98]  strong
[3124.98 --> 3125.72]  and full
[3125.72 --> 3126.56]  and capable
[3126.56 --> 3127.58]  and there's so much
[3127.58 --> 3128.06]  promise.
[3128.44 --> 3129.18]  Live your life
[3129.18 --> 3129.72]  now
[3129.72 --> 3131.10]  in the reality
[3131.10 --> 3131.94]  that you
[3131.94 --> 3133.46]  are created
[3133.46 --> 3134.70]  and you
[3134.70 --> 3136.10]  are living
[3136.10 --> 3137.04]  before
[3137.04 --> 3138.30]  a good
[3138.30 --> 3139.64]  and sovereign
[3139.64 --> 3140.64]  creator.
[3143.42 --> 3144.12]  Now why?
[3144.42 --> 3145.34]  Why does this
[3145.34 --> 3146.62]  matter?
[3146.62 --> 3155.34]  Everything else
[3155.34 --> 3156.94]  in this chapter
[3156.94 --> 3159.86]  is a slow
[3159.86 --> 3161.38]  and poetic
[3161.38 --> 3163.20]  unraveling
[3163.20 --> 3164.72]  of the illusion
[3164.72 --> 3165.98]  that we can
[3165.98 --> 3167.04]  hold on to life
[3167.04 --> 3167.96]  on our own terms.
[3169.04 --> 3170.08]  The house trembles
[3170.08 --> 3171.16]  the keepers shake
[3171.16 --> 3172.22]  the grinders stop
[3172.22 --> 3173.22]  the windows darken
[3173.22 --> 3174.02]  the doors close
[3174.02 --> 3174.98]  the light fades
[3174.98 --> 3176.24]  the body bends
[3176.24 --> 3176.92]  and the breath
[3176.92 --> 3178.02]  returns to the God
[3178.02 --> 3179.20]  who gave it.
[3179.96 --> 3180.56]  Ecclesiastes
[3180.56 --> 3181.70]  throughout this whole book
[3181.70 --> 3182.70]  hasn't been
[3182.70 --> 3184.22]  painting this picture
[3184.22 --> 3185.40]  hasn't been opening
[3185.40 --> 3186.84]  our eyes to this reality
[3186.84 --> 3188.62]  to depress us
[3188.62 --> 3189.78]  but instead
[3189.78 --> 3191.50]  to wake us up.
[3192.96 --> 3193.88]  The teacher
[3193.88 --> 3195.00]  wants us to see
[3195.00 --> 3195.70]  that youth
[3195.70 --> 3196.38]  and joy
[3196.38 --> 3197.14]  and security
[3197.14 --> 3198.46]  cannot bear
[3198.46 --> 3199.16]  the weight
[3199.16 --> 3200.48]  that we put on them
[3200.48 --> 3202.08]  and not because
[3202.08 --> 3203.06]  they're bad gifts
[3203.06 --> 3205.08]  but because
[3205.08 --> 3205.86]  they're temporary.
[3206.24 --> 3208.12]  And anything
[3208.12 --> 3208.74]  temporary
[3208.74 --> 3209.90]  will eventually
[3209.90 --> 3210.88]  let you down
[3210.88 --> 3211.92]  if you treat it
[3211.92 --> 3212.40]  as ultimate.
[3214.26 --> 3214.64]  And so
[3214.64 --> 3215.12]  really
[3215.12 --> 3215.72]  the biblical
[3215.72 --> 3216.38]  contrast
[3216.38 --> 3217.50]  looks like
[3217.50 --> 3218.24]  this.
[3219.06 --> 3220.16]  On the one hand
[3220.16 --> 3221.20]  the world says
[3221.20 --> 3222.56]  build a life
[3222.56 --> 3223.08]  that keeps
[3223.08 --> 3223.86]  the hard things
[3223.86 --> 3224.30]  away.
[3225.26 --> 3226.04]  The teacher
[3226.04 --> 3226.56]  says
[3226.56 --> 3227.98]  remember
[3227.98 --> 3228.82]  the God
[3228.82 --> 3229.30]  who will be
[3229.30 --> 3229.82]  with you
[3229.82 --> 3230.58]  when they come.
[3230.58 --> 3232.66]  the world
[3232.66 --> 3233.14]  says
[3233.14 --> 3234.26]  look inward
[3234.26 --> 3235.64]  find your truth
[3235.64 --> 3236.42]  your strength
[3236.42 --> 3237.22]  and your meaning
[3237.22 --> 3238.20]  the teacher
[3238.20 --> 3238.66]  says
[3238.66 --> 3239.36]  look upward
[3239.36 --> 3241.34]  find the one
[3241.34 --> 3242.32]  who made you
[3242.32 --> 3243.84]  and sustains you
[3243.84 --> 3245.80]  the world
[3245.80 --> 3246.18]  says
[3246.18 --> 3247.46]  secure your life
[3247.46 --> 3248.50]  through effort
[3248.50 --> 3249.44]  find meaning
[3249.44 --> 3250.42]  in what you do
[3250.42 --> 3250.96]  the teacher
[3250.96 --> 3251.48]  says
[3251.48 --> 3252.68]  secure your life
[3252.68 --> 3253.70]  by entrusting it
[3253.70 --> 3254.68]  to your creator
[3254.68 --> 3256.94]  the world
[3256.94 --> 3257.32]  says
[3257.32 --> 3258.22]  especially if you
[3258.22 --> 3258.66]  are young
[3258.66 --> 3260.08]  you have
[3260.08 --> 3260.66]  time
[3260.66 --> 3262.70]  and the teacher
[3262.70 --> 3263.10]  says
[3263.10 --> 3264.76]  you don't know
[3264.76 --> 3265.22]  how much time
[3265.22 --> 3265.64]  you have
[3265.64 --> 3267.12]  remember
[3267.12 --> 3267.88]  him
[3267.88 --> 3268.74]  now
[3268.74 --> 3270.80]  and this is
[3270.80 --> 3271.18]  the heart
[3271.18 --> 3271.72]  of wisdom
[3271.72 --> 3273.06]  in ecclesiastes
[3273.06 --> 3273.92]  that you
[3273.92 --> 3274.92]  cannot live
[3274.92 --> 3275.50]  well
[3275.50 --> 3276.66]  if you forget
[3276.66 --> 3277.30]  the one
[3277.30 --> 3278.14]  who gave you
[3278.14 --> 3278.58]  life
[3278.58 --> 3279.42]  you cannot
[3279.42 --> 3280.00]  rejoice
[3280.00 --> 3280.68]  rightly
[3280.68 --> 3281.98]  if you detach
[3281.98 --> 3282.72]  the gift
[3282.72 --> 3283.84]  from the giver
[3283.84 --> 3284.60]  you cannot
[3284.60 --> 3285.76]  face the limits
[3285.76 --> 3286.52]  of life
[3286.52 --> 3287.20]  if you try
[3287.20 --> 3287.78]  to build
[3287.78 --> 3288.30]  a life
[3288.30 --> 3288.66]  without
[3288.66 --> 3289.44]  the God
[3289.44 --> 3290.18]  who stands
[3290.18 --> 3290.88]  outside of
[3290.88 --> 3291.48]  those limits
[3291.48 --> 3293.06]  and again
[3293.06 --> 3293.46]  the teacher
[3293.46 --> 3293.92]  isn't trying
[3293.92 --> 3294.44]  to crush
[3294.44 --> 3295.50]  our joy
[3295.50 --> 3296.10]  he's trying
[3296.10 --> 3296.74]  rather to
[3296.74 --> 3297.54]  anchor it
[3297.54 --> 3299.16]  and the only
[3299.16 --> 3300.06]  anchor deep
[3300.06 --> 3300.54]  enough
[3300.54 --> 3301.94]  to secure
[3301.94 --> 3302.46]  this
[3302.46 --> 3303.36]  is our
[3303.36 --> 3303.82]  creator
[3303.82 --> 3304.40]  himself
[3304.40 --> 3311.90]  all of
[3311.90 --> 3312.26]  this
[3312.26 --> 3315.08]  became
[3315.08 --> 3316.28]  abundantly
[3316.28 --> 3316.88]  real for
[3316.88 --> 3317.18]  me
[3317.18 --> 3318.90]  on June
[3318.90 --> 3319.54]  28
[3319.54 --> 3321.04]  2007
[3321.04 --> 3323.40]  two months
[3323.40 --> 3323.78]  before
[3323.78 --> 3324.54]  June 28
[3324.54 --> 3326.06]  Rachel and
[3326.06 --> 3326.44]  I had just
[3326.44 --> 3326.94]  gotten married
[3326.94 --> 3329.94]  a month
[3329.94 --> 3330.42]  after we got
[3330.42 --> 3330.72]  married
[3330.72 --> 3332.18]  we graduated
[3332.18 --> 3332.82]  university
[3332.82 --> 3334.32]  Rachel with
[3334.32 --> 3334.94]  distinction and
[3334.94 --> 3335.22]  honors
[3335.22 --> 3335.96]  I was just
[3335.96 --> 3336.18]  there
[3336.18 --> 3339.98]  I was 24
[3339.98 --> 3341.78]  and I was
[3341.78 --> 3342.76]  firmly living
[3342.76 --> 3343.42]  out of the
[3343.42 --> 3344.54]  invulnerability
[3344.54 --> 3345.22]  impulse
[3345.22 --> 3346.94]  the world
[3346.94 --> 3347.78]  was mine
[3347.78 --> 3348.10]  for the
[3348.10 --> 3348.46]  taking
[3348.46 --> 3350.64]  but on
[3350.64 --> 3351.28]  June 28
[3351.28 --> 3353.14]  that changed
[3353.14 --> 3355.80]  June 28
[3355.80 --> 3356.20]  we got a
[3356.20 --> 3356.72]  phone call
[3356.72 --> 3358.08]  that a
[3358.08 --> 3358.46]  friend of
[3358.46 --> 3358.80]  mine
[3358.80 --> 3359.40]  and actually
[3359.40 --> 3359.76]  there's a
[3359.76 --> 3360.30]  few of us
[3360.30 --> 3360.96]  here who
[3360.96 --> 3361.64]  knew him
[3361.64 --> 3362.00]  that a
[3362.00 --> 3362.28]  friend of

[3363.96 --> 3364.58]  years old

[3365.82 --> 3366.50]  in a car
[3366.50 --> 3366.86]  crash
[3366.86 --> 3369.82]  I'd lived
[3369.82 --> 3370.24]  with him for
[3370.24 --> 3370.82]  two years
[3370.82 --> 3372.28]  he was a
[3372.28 --> 3372.80]  great friend
[3372.80 --> 3378.06]  and on
[3378.06 --> 3378.56]  that day
[3378.56 --> 3381.08]  car crossed
[3381.08 --> 3381.48]  the center
[3381.48 --> 3381.82]  line
[3381.82 --> 3382.38]  while he
[3382.38 --> 3382.86]  was driving

[3443.58 --> 3443.78]  that
[3443.78 --> 3443.90]  we
[3443.90 --> 3444.08]  were

[3456.90 --> 3457.26]  also
[3457.26 --> 3457.80]  knows
[3457.80 --> 3458.80]  that

[3466.20 --> 3466.82]  lasting
[3466.82 --> 3467.48]  delight
[3467.48 --> 3468.24]  and
[3468.24 --> 3468.44]  yet
[3468.44 --> 3468.90]  keeps
[3468.90 --> 3469.64]  grasping

[3693.70 --> 3693.88]  that
[3693.88 --> 3694.00]  you
[3694.00 --> 3694.14]  were
[3694.14 --> 3694.42]  made

[3767.36 --> 3767.72]  question
[3767.72 --> 3768.16]  as we

[3770.36 --> 3770.70]  this
[3770.70 --> 3771.50]  series
[3771.50 --> 3771.80]  is
[3771.80 --> 3772.08]  how
[3772.08 --> 3772.36]  do
[3772.36 --> 3772.66]  we
[3772.66 --> 3773.34]  actually

[3776.52 --> 3777.18]  take
[3777.18 --> 3777.62]  this
[3777.62 --> 3778.06]  big
[3778.06 --> 3778.66]  idea
[3778.66 --> 3779.74]  from

[3786.70 --> 3789.34]  ecclesiastes
[3789.34 --> 3790.00]  doesn't
[3790.00 --> 3790.68]  leave us
[3790.68 --> 3790.92]  with
[3790.92 --> 3791.64]  abstract
[3791.64 --> 3792.36]  wisdom
[3792.36 --> 3792.62]  in

[3793.54 --> 3794.00]  sense
[3794.00 --> 3794.90]  abstract
[3794.90 --> 3795.44]  wisdom
[3795.44 --> 3796.22]  is an
[3796.22 --> 3796.98]  oxymoron
[3796.98 --> 3797.88]  wisdom
[3797.88 --> 3798.68]  is always
[3798.68 --> 3799.26]  lived and
[3799.26 --> 3799.72]  practical
[3799.72 --> 3800.50]  there's
[3800.50 --> 3800.78]  nothing
[3800.78 --> 3801.18]  abstract

[3802.20 --> 3803.58]  in
[3803.58 --> 3804.22]  ecclesiastes
[3804.22 --> 3804.66]  we are
[3804.66 --> 3805.02]  pointed
[3805.02 --> 3805.42]  towards
[3805.42 --> 3805.88]  habits
[3805.88 --> 3806.16]  and
[3806.16 --> 3806.60]  practices
[3806.60 --> 3806.92]  and
[3806.92 --> 3807.36]  rhythms
[3807.36 --> 3807.68]  that
[3807.68 --> 3808.06]  shape
[3808.06 --> 3808.56]  our
[3808.56 --> 3809.34]  hearts
[3809.34 --> 3810.16]  and
[3810.16 --> 3810.30]  so
[3810.30 --> 3810.52]  here
[3810.52 --> 3810.64]  are
[3810.64 --> 3810.86]  three
[3810.86 --> 3811.30]  ways
[3811.30 --> 3811.48]  that
[3811.48 --> 3811.58]  we
[3811.58 --> 3811.74]  can
[3811.74 --> 3812.14]  live
[3812.14 --> 3813.04]  as

[3820.06 --> 3820.78]  reflection
[3820.78 --> 3821.60]  and
[3821.60 --> 3822.10]  gratitude
[3822.10 --> 3824.46]  memory
[3824.46 --> 3825.20]  shapes

[3825.74 --> 3827.20]  and
[3827.20 --> 3827.34]  so
[3827.34 --> 3827.58]  take
[3827.58 --> 3828.02]  time
[3828.02 --> 3828.42]  to
[3828.42 --> 3828.80]  recall
[3828.80 --> 3829.22]  what
[3829.22 --> 3829.46]  God
[3829.46 --> 3829.64]  has
[3829.64 --> 3829.84]  done
[3829.84 --> 3830.08]  for
[3830.08 --> 3830.30]  you
[3830.30 --> 3831.36]  in

[3832.82 --> 3833.58]  and
[3833.58 --> 3834.04]  most
[3834.04 --> 3834.70]  profoundly
[3834.70 --> 3835.08]  in
[3835.08 --> 3835.50]  Christ
[3835.50 --> 3837.14]  and

[3842.36 --> 3842.80]  each
[3842.80 --> 3843.26]  day
[3843.26 --> 3844.24]  in
[3844.24 --> 3844.38]  a
[3844.38 --> 3844.64]  way
[3844.64 --> 3844.92]  that
[3844.92 --> 3845.54]  says
[3845.54 --> 3846.64]  God
[3846.64 --> 3847.22]  you
[3847.22 --> 3847.62]  are
[3847.62 --> 3848.32]  good
[3848.32 --> 3849.02]  in
[3849.02 --> 3849.20]  a way
[3849.20 --> 3849.38]  that
[3849.38 --> 3849.84]  notices
[3849.84 --> 3850.24]  his
[3850.24 --> 3850.70]  gifts
[3850.70 --> 3851.22]  and

[3852.38 --> 3853.04]  gratitude
[3853.04 --> 3853.58]  is
[3853.58 --> 3853.80]  the
[3853.80 --> 3854.30]  natural
[3854.30 --> 3855.34]  response
[3855.34 --> 3856.20]  of a

[3858.58 --> 3859.14]  towards
[3859.14 --> 3859.68]  God
[3859.68 --> 3860.42]  and

[3860.56 --> 3860.88]  ask
[3860.88 --> 3861.36]  yourself
[3861.36 --> 3862.40]  what

[3874.38 --> 3875.32]  strengthened
[3875.32 --> 3876.08]  when it
[3876.08 --> 3876.44]  becomes
[3876.44 --> 3877.02]  a regular

[3877.54 --> 3878.16]  of life

[3889.30 --> 3889.46]  we
[3889.46 --> 3890.22]  practice
[3890.22 --> 3891.04]  remembering

[3895.24 --> 3895.72]  to

[3897.52 --> 3898.24]  or
[3898.24 --> 3898.90]  especially
[3898.90 --> 3899.40]  when
[3899.40 --> 3899.70]  life
[3899.70 --> 3900.08]  feels
[3900.08 --> 3900.80]  ordinary

[3901.72 --> 3902.18]  chaotic
[3902.18 --> 3903.36]  and
[3903.36 --> 3903.48]  the

[3903.68 --> 3903.94]  often
[3903.94 --> 3904.14]  we
[3904.14 --> 3904.56]  practice
[3904.56 --> 3904.98]  the

[3905.28 --> 3906.34]  automatic

[3907.74 --> 3908.62]  becomes
[3908.62 --> 3910.00]  and
[3910.00 --> 3910.10]  when
[3910.10 --> 3910.38]  these
[3910.38 --> 3911.36]  practices
[3911.36 --> 3911.96]  become
[3911.96 --> 3912.52]  automatic
[3912.52 --> 3913.24]  whether
[3913.24 --> 3913.52]  the

[3913.94 --> 3914.50]  comes
[3914.50 --> 3914.80]  or

[3917.86 --> 3918.26]  moments
[3918.26 --> 3918.58]  is
[3918.58 --> 3918.80]  our
[3918.80 --> 3919.20]  first
[3919.20 --> 3919.76]  instinct
[3919.76 --> 3920.66]  instead
[3920.66 --> 3920.80]  of
[3920.80 --> 3920.92]  our
[3920.92 --> 3921.20]  last
[3921.20 --> 3921.54]  resort
[3921.54 --> 3923.08]  and
[3923.08 --> 3923.20]  so
[3923.20 --> 3923.48]  ask
[3923.48 --> 3923.82]  yourself
[3923.82 --> 3924.98]  how do
[3924.98 --> 3925.28]  I put
[3925.28 --> 3925.62]  myself
[3925.62 --> 3925.82]  in
[3925.82 --> 3926.14]  places
[3926.14 --> 3926.42]  to
[3926.42 --> 3926.64]  make

[3927.24 --> 3928.44]  easier
[3928.44 --> 3930.82]  and
[3930.82 --> 3931.02]  maybe
[3931.02 --> 3931.42]  reflect
[3931.42 --> 3931.72]  do I
[3931.72 --> 3931.86]  need
[3931.86 --> 3932.00]  to
[3932.00 --> 3932.36]  join
[3932.36 --> 3933.32]  a
[3933.32 --> 3933.60]  worship
[3933.60 --> 3933.98]  night
[3933.98 --> 3934.84]  a

[3936.62 --> 3937.86]  community
[3937.86 --> 3938.20]  of
[3938.20 --> 3938.52]  faith
[3938.52 --> 3939.34]  that
[3939.34 --> 3939.50]  will
[3939.50 --> 3939.90]  help
[3939.90 --> 3940.50]  me
[3940.50 --> 3941.64]  strengthen
[3941.64 --> 3942.58]  my
[3942.58 --> 3943.06]  remembering
[3943.06 --> 3944.48]  and
[3944.48 --> 3944.64]  then
[3944.64 --> 3944.92]  third
[3944.92 --> 3946.92]  actualize
[3946.92 --> 3947.20]  make
[3947.20 --> 3947.76]  real
[3947.76 --> 3948.38]  your

[3949.56 --> 3950.14]  everyday
[3950.14 --> 3951.30]  choices
[3951.30 --> 3952.26]  right
[3952.26 --> 3952.56]  we said
[3952.56 --> 3952.72]  this
[3952.72 --> 3953.14]  remembering
[3953.14 --> 3953.76]  is not
[3953.76 --> 3954.08]  just
[3954.08 --> 3954.90]  reflective
[3954.90 --> 3955.84]  it
[3955.84 --> 3956.22]  shapes
[3956.22 --> 3956.46]  how
[3956.46 --> 3956.68]  we
[3956.68 --> 3956.98]  live
[3956.98 --> 3958.44]  and
[3958.44 --> 3958.56]  so
[3958.56 --> 3958.86]  ask
[3958.86 --> 3959.12]  how
[3959.12 --> 3959.28]  do
[3959.28 --> 3959.54]  my
[3959.54 --> 3960.32]  words
[3960.32 --> 3960.72]  my

[3962.36 --> 3963.16]  reflect
[3963.16 --> 3963.40]  the
[3963.40 --> 3963.84]  God
[3963.84 --> 3964.30]  I
[3964.30 --> 3964.66]  remember
[3964.66 --> 3964.88]  and
[3964.88 --> 3965.18]  here's
[3965.18 --> 3965.28]  what
[3965.28 --> 3965.36]  I
[3965.36 --> 3965.46]  mean
[3965.46 --> 3965.60]  with
[3965.60 --> 3965.78]  that
[3965.78 --> 3967.02]  maybe
[3967.02 --> 3968.06]  instead
[3968.06 --> 3968.44]  of
[3968.44 --> 3969.06]  looking
[3969.06 --> 3969.52]  to

[3970.26 --> 3971.06]  protection
[3971.06 --> 3971.60]  or

[3973.30 --> 3973.52]  or
[3973.52 --> 3973.88]  whatever
[3973.88 --> 3974.42]  language
[3974.42 --> 3974.64]  you
[3974.64 --> 3974.82]  want
[3974.82 --> 3974.92]  to
[3974.92 --> 3975.30]  use
[3975.30 --> 3976.02]  maybe
[3976.02 --> 3977.12]  adopt
[3977.12 --> 3978.16]  generosity
[3978.16 --> 3981.36]  what
[3981.36 --> 3981.46]  does
[3981.46 --> 3981.56]  it
[3981.56 --> 3981.72]  look
[3981.72 --> 3981.98]  like
[3981.98 --> 3982.28]  to
[3982.28 --> 3983.08]  practice
[3983.08 --> 3983.92]  patience
[3983.92 --> 3985.28]  in the

[3985.50 --> 3985.62]  of
[3985.62 --> 3986.12]  anxiety
[3986.12 --> 3987.82]  what
[3987.82 --> 3987.94]  does
[3987.94 --> 3988.04]  it
[3988.04 --> 3988.18]  look
[3988.18 --> 3988.32]  like
[3988.32 --> 3988.50]  to
[3988.50 --> 3988.92]  praise
[3988.92 --> 3989.38]  God
[3989.38 --> 3990.48]  rather
[3990.48 --> 3990.66]  than
[3990.66 --> 3990.84]  to
[3990.84 --> 3991.30]  complain
[3991.30 --> 3993.22]  living
[3993.22 --> 3993.52]  with
[3993.52 --> 3993.86]  God
[3993.86 --> 3994.00]  at
[3994.00 --> 3994.14]  the

[3994.46 --> 3995.24]  transforms
[3995.24 --> 3995.60]  our

[3997.98 --> 3998.22]  of
[3998.22 --> 3999.06]  worship
[3999.06 --> 3999.64]  that's
[3999.64 --> 3999.78]  how
[3999.78 --> 4000.32]  remembering
[4000.32 --> 4000.84]  becomes
[4000.84 --> 4001.86]  actualized
[4001.86 --> 4002.02]  we
[4002.02 --> 4002.28]  take
[4002.28 --> 4002.50]  the

[4063.44 --> 4064.68]  we
[4064.68 --> 4064.88]  all

[4065.74 --> 4066.04]  cannot
[4066.04 --> 4066.68]  satisfy

[4068.58 --> 4069.06]  now
[4069.06 --> 4069.70]  maybe
[4069.70 --> 4070.78]  we

[4535.38 --> 4539.74]  Open up my eyes in wonder
[4539.74 --> 4543.16]  And show me who you are
[4543.16 --> 4546.30]  And fill me with your heart
[4546.30 --> 4549.28]  And lead me in your love
[4549.28 --> 4553.06]  To those around me
[4553.06 --> 4566.24]  Amen
[4566.24 --> 4571.24]  Before we go, just a reminder
[4571.24 --> 4572.76]  Maybe a word of encouragement
[4572.76 --> 4574.82]  If you are looking to pray with someone
[4574.82 --> 4575.96]  There will be someone up here
[4575.96 --> 4577.36]  With a yellow name tag on
[4577.36 --> 4578.30]  They would love to meet you
[4578.30 --> 4580.98]  And pray with you as well
[4580.98 --> 4583.70]  If you have been worshipping with us
[4583.70 --> 4585.50]  For some time as a guest
[4585.50 --> 4586.52]  And are wondering about
[4586.52 --> 4587.78]  What it looks like to connect
[4587.78 --> 4589.22]  More intentionally
[4589.22 --> 4591.28]  And to wonder about membership
[4591.28 --> 4594.18]  I am going to be at the connect booth there
[4594.18 --> 4595.76]  You can come talk to me
[4595.76 --> 4596.92]  Following the service
[4596.92 --> 4599.34]  And we can talk about
[4599.34 --> 4601.30]  What that might look like for you
[4601.30 --> 4603.14]  As you go, receive the blessing
[4603.14 --> 4604.42]  Of our good God
[4604.42 --> 4610.02]  God, go before you
[4610.02 --> 4611.10]  To lead you
[4611.10 --> 4612.94]  God, go behind you
[4612.94 --> 4614.06]  To protect you
[4614.06 --> 4616.62]  God, go beneath you
[4616.62 --> 4617.64]  To support you
[4617.64 --> 4619.42]  God, go beside you
[4619.42 --> 4620.56]  To befriend you
[4620.56 --> 4622.60]  Do not be afraid
[4622.60 --> 4624.16]  Let the blessing of God
[4624.16 --> 4625.08]  Come upon you today
[4625.08 --> 4626.84]  Do not be afraid
[4626.84 --> 4629.38]  But go in peace
[4629.38 --> 4631.46]  To remember your creator
[4631.46 --> 4633.52]  In the days of your youth
[4633.52 --> 4634.76]  Amen
[4634.76 --> 4654.08]  In the darkness we were waiting
[4654.08 --> 4657.40]  Without hope and without light
[4657.40 --> 4660.62]  Till from heaven you came running
[4660.62 --> 4664.40]  There was mercy in your eyes
[4664.40 --> 4667.30]  To fulfill the law and prophets
[4667.30 --> 4669.14]  To affirm to me
[4669.14 --> 4670.14]  The Lord
[4670.14 --> 4673.96]  The throne of endless glory
[4673.96 --> 4677.82]  To a cradle in the dirt
[4677.82 --> 4678.82]  Praise the Lord
[4678.82 --> 4684.50]  Praise the Father
[4684.50 --> 4686.50]  Praise the Son
[4686.50 --> 4687.50]  Praise the Spirit
[4687.50 --> 4691.50]  Praise the Spirit
[4691.50 --> 4694.50]  Three in one
[4694.50 --> 4697.34]  God of glory
[4697.34 --> 4699.34]  Glory of majesty
[4699.34 --> 4700.02]  Praise the Lord
[4700.02 --> 4705.02]  Praise the Lord
[4705.02 --> 4714.94]  To reveal the kingdom coming
[4714.94 --> 4718.32]  And to recognize the lost
[4718.32 --> 4721.40]  To redeem the whole creation
[4721.40 --> 4724.90]  You did not despise the cross
[4724.90 --> 4727.86]  For even in your suffering
[4727.86 --> 4731.08]  You saw to the other side
[4731.08 --> 4734.10]  Knowing this was our salvation
[4734.10 --> 4737.92]  Jesus, for our sake you died
[4737.92 --> 4748.36]  Praise the Father, praise the Son
[4748.36 --> 4754.64]  Praise the Spirit, free in love
[4754.64 --> 4760.68]  God of glory, mountain sea
[4760.68 --> 4767.58]  Praise forever to the King of kings
[4767.58 --> 4773.88]  In the morning that you rose
[4773.88 --> 4777.00]  All of heaven held its breath
[4777.00 --> 4780.18]  Till a stone was moved for good
[4780.18 --> 4783.36]  For the Lamb had conquered death
[4783.36 --> 4786.62]  And the dead rose from their tombs
[4786.62 --> 4789.68]  And the angels stood in awe
[4789.68 --> 4792.76]  For the souls of all who come
[4792.76 --> 4795.60]  To the Father are restored
[4795.60 --> 4799.14]  And the Church of Christ was born
[4799.14 --> 4802.10]  Then the Spirit lived on faith
[4802.10 --> 4805.12]  Now this gospel through the whole
[4805.12 --> 4808.32]  Shall I kneel, shall I faint
[4808.32 --> 4811.22]  By His blood, by His name
[4811.22 --> 4814.20]  In His freedom I am free
[4814.20 --> 4817.38]  For the love of Jesus Christ
[4817.38 --> 4820.56]  Who has resurrected me
[4820.56 --> 4830.18]  Praise the Father, praise the Son
[4830.18 --> 4836.74]  Praise the Spirit, free in one
[4836.74 --> 4841.92]  God of glory, majesty
[4841.92 --> 4844.24]  Praise forever to the King of kings
[4844.24 --> 4849.24]  Praise forever to the King of kings
[4849.24 --> 4853.86]  Praise the Father, praise the Son
[4853.86 --> 4859.24]  Praise the Spirit, three in one
[4859.24 --> 4860.54]  God of glory, majesty
[4860.54 --> 4868.72]  Praise the Father, praise the Son
[4868.72 --> 4872.92]  Praise forever to the King of kings
[4872.92 --> 4875.86]  Praise forever to the King of kings
[4875.86 --> 4879.92]  Praise forever to the King of kings
[4879.92 --> 4880.92]  Amen.
[4909.92 --> 4910.92]  Amen.
[4939.92 --> 4940.92]  Amen.
[4969.92 --> 4970.92]  Amen.
