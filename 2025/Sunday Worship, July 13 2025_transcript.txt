[1054.00 --> 1056.84]  Is pleasing in our Father's sight
[1056.84 --> 1061.20]  We pray that the words we speak show a heart
[1061.20 --> 1062.70]  That has been reborn
[1062.70 --> 1065.82]  That in him we are a new creation
[1065.82 --> 1069.40]  Speaking in a way that communicates his love
[1069.40 --> 1071.40]  That's power heads
[1071.40 --> 1076.94]  Father, our heart's desire is to please you
[1076.94 --> 1080.00]  Continue to fill us with your spirit
[1080.00 --> 1084.10]  And purify our desires to fall in step with you
[1084.10 --> 1090.58]  Forgive us when we let our old nature influence what we say
[1090.58 --> 1094.26]  And control what our hearts long for
[1094.26 --> 1097.36]  May the words we speak
[1097.36 --> 1099.66]  And the things we meditate on
[1099.66 --> 1101.66]  Be pleasing to you

[1133.88 --> 1137.98]  Now in here
[1137.98 --> 1141.60]  I find my rest

[1468.36 --> 1470.44]  You invite to be seated.
[1481.04 --> 1484.38]  Good morning. My name is Brenda and I'm one of the deacons here at Emanuel.
[1484.94 --> 1489.32]  We have the pleasure of continuing our worship with the giving of our gifts.
[1489.32 --> 1497.84]  To the budget which covers the ministry and mission of our church and also our special offering today is for the Langley Food Bank.
[1497.84 --> 1508.16]  The Langley Food Bank exists in our community to offer support and in tangible ways help for those who are in need.
[1508.82 --> 1518.52]  And I get to say a great big thank you to this congregation, this church family, who once again stepped up in these last weeks.
[1518.52 --> 1525.48]  And we were able to have our food bank drive and festival yesterday.
[1525.48 --> 1531.00]  And you can see the results here.
[1531.00 --> 1537.00]  We were able to pass out bags, grocery bags within our Murrayville community here.
[1537.00 --> 1541.96]  And yesterday there was opportunity for people to bring those bags back.
[1541.96 --> 1552.32]  We enjoyed pancake breakfast and sausages and some games and conversation with those in our community who came to join us yesterday.
[1552.32 --> 1554.84]  So thank you.
[1554.84 --> 1555.84]  Thank you.
[1555.84 --> 1561.64]  On behalf of the deacons, thank you for helping us and for helping our community.
[1561.64 --> 1564.84]  We pray that this will be a blessing.
[1564.84 --> 1571.84]  I know that Josh from the Food Bank, when he comes to pick this up this week, will be overwhelmed once again by what has been gathered here.
[1571.84 --> 1576.36]  Some questions sometimes have come up as to why we do this in July.
[1576.36 --> 1583.60]  Because a lot of people are on holidays and would we get more support and more people participating in this.
[1583.60 --> 1594.60]  And the simple answer to that has come directly from the Food Bank that July is the month that they receive the least amount of stuff.
[1594.60 --> 1603.60]  And so we have, as deacons have decided, that we will, that continuing to do this in July is a benefit for our community.
[1603.60 --> 1626.60]  So thank you for being a blessing.
[1626.60 --> 1656.58]  Thank you.
[1656.60 --> 1673.60]  I will proclaim
[1673.60 --> 1680.60]  The glory of the risen Lord
[1680.60 --> 1685.60]  Who once was slain
[1686.60 --> 1692.60]  To reconcile men to God
[1692.60 --> 1697.60]  Forever He will be
[1697.60 --> 1703.60]  The Lamb upon the throne
[1703.60 --> 1709.60]  And gladly bow my knee
[1709.60 --> 1714.60]  And worship Him alone
[1714.60 --> 1720.60]  Forever You will be
[1720.60 --> 1725.60]  The Lamb upon the throne
[1725.60 --> 1731.60]  I gladly bow my knee
[1731.60 --> 1737.60]  And worship You alone
[1737.60 --> 1739.60]  Or there be some love
[1739.60 --> 1744.60]  Only oneeron P bridge
[1744.60 --> 1746.60]  My heart is dying
[1746.60 --> 1748.60]  The Lord for equal Familial
[1748.60 --> 1750.60]  Die table
[1750.60 --> 1753.60]  From alleœurs free
[1753.60 --> 1758.60]  Then pray down and ما
[1758.60 --> 1759.60]  Thank you.
[1788.60 --> 1818.58]  Thank you.
[1818.60 --> 1848.58]  Thank you.
[1848.60 --> 1878.58]  Thank you.
[1878.58 --> 1880.58]  Thank you.
[1908.58 --> 1909.58]  Thank you.
[1909.58 --> 1910.58]  God is awesome.
[1910.58 --> 1918.58]  Before we pray this morning, Clem's mom passed away Friday.
[1918.58 --> 1948.58] 
[1948.58 --> 1958.58]  We want to continue to pray for Tanya Tessemaker, who most Sundays joins us here, and they are both dealing with cancer.
[1958.58 --> 1966.58]  Also, we want to continue to pray for Clary's sister, who is also dealing with stuff.
[1966.58 --> 1976.58]  What I want to do this morning before I pray is just recite one of my favorite songs, hymns, and I won't do the whole thing, just one of the first verses.
[1976.58 --> 1981.58]  And that is, have thine own way, Lord, have thine own way.
[1981.58 --> 1984.58]  You are the potter, and we are the clay.
[1984.58 --> 1987.58]  Mold us and make us after your will.
[1987.58 --> 1989.58]  While we are waiting, yielded and still.
[1989.58 --> 1991.58]  While we are waiting, yielded and still.
[1991.58 --> 1997.58]  And the part that's not a part of this song is, Lord, help us to be waiting, yielded and still.
[1997.58 --> 1999.58]  That's a, that's a hard.
[1999.58 --> 2001.58]  Join me in prayer, please.
[2001.58 --> 2005.58]  Our Father in Heaven, Lord, thank you.
[2005.58 --> 2009.58]  Lord, thank you for where we live, how we live.
[2009.58 --> 2011.58]  Lord, thank you for new babies.
[2011.58 --> 2013.58]  Thank you for marriages.
[2013.58 --> 2021.58]  Lord, we pray for people who are dealing with, again today, the Molenkamps, Lord, with passing of Clemsum.
[2021.58 --> 2029.58]  Lord, we also pray for everybody else who, in the last while, has had to deal with somebody's passing, Lord.
[2029.58 --> 2039.58]  Lord, we pray will you give us grace, will you give us wisdom, will you give us insight, will you, will you help us to also reach out to people who are hurting that way.
[2039.58 --> 2046.58]  Lord, and then we want to thank the people who are dealing with cancer or, or something other, health problem.
[2046.58 --> 2049.58]  Lord, we pray for each one.
[2049.58 --> 2052.58]  Lord, we pray for new parents.
[2052.58 --> 2055.58]  We pray for parents that have children, have new children.
[2055.58 --> 2062.58]  Lord, we pray will you help us as parents to raise those little ones, and the little ones tend to get bigger, Lord.
[2062.58 --> 2074.58]  And we ask you also that, as adults, we may not only tell our kids what to do, but lead by example.
[2074.58 --> 2079.58]  Lord, because they're, they're probably going to watch us more than they listen.
[2079.58 --> 2080.58]  Lord, we pray for kids.
[2080.58 --> 2085.58]  Lord, we pray for preschoolers who are now worshiping with their leaders.
[2085.58 --> 2089.58]  Lord, we thank you for the praise team this morning and all mornings, Lord.
[2089.58 --> 2094.58]  Lord, we thank you for anybody who does any kind of a role in this church.
[2094.58 --> 2096.58]  We pray we bless them, Lord.
[2096.58 --> 2100.58]  We pray will you be with us this summer as some take a break.
[2100.58 --> 2102.58]  We pray will you be with teachers, Lord.
[2102.58 --> 2105.58]  Give them an awesome break, and kids as well, Lord.
[2105.58 --> 2111.58]  We pray for kids who are looking to go into a new grade next year, maybe even a new school.
[2111.58 --> 2120.58]  And instead of being the little kids in the big school or the big kids in the little school, Lord, help them to do that transition.
[2120.58 --> 2129.58]  Lord, we pray for older children who have, young adults who have gone off to college and back again for a while,
[2129.58 --> 2131.58]  and are in the midst of their studies, Lord.
[2131.58 --> 2133.58]  Will you help each one of them?
[2133.58 --> 2141.58]  Thank you for all the opportunities, not only in school for education, but also for trips people have made or are making, Lord.
[2141.58 --> 2144.58]  We pray will you be with people who travel.
[2144.58 --> 2152.58]  We pray will you be with each of us, Lord, and all the things we are dealing with, some known, some unknown.
[2152.58 --> 2155.58]  Lord, we ask you to help and guide us.
[2155.58 --> 2159.58]  Lord, we live in a different world, Lord.
[2159.58 --> 2164.58]  So many things going on, so many not good things, and yet you are in control.
[2164.58 --> 2168.58]  We know that, but, Lord, it's something we just don't understand.
[2168.58 --> 2171.58]  Help us to trust and obey, Lord.
[2171.58 --> 2175.58]  Lord, this morning we ask for a blessing on Grant as he brings your word.
[2175.58 --> 2180.58]  Will you help us to listen, to pay attention?
[2180.58 --> 2183.58]  Will you give him your spirit?
[2183.58 --> 2191.58]  Lord, will you help us to be part of that learning while we trust and obey?
[2191.58 --> 2193.58]  Thank you in Jesus' name. Amen.
[2193.58 --> 2205.58]  Amen.
[2205.58 --> 2214.58]  What is the one area in your life where Satan could blow you out of the water?
[2214.58 --> 2224.58]  This is a question my mentor, Martin Quintant, asked me every time as a pastor for the first five years after I started ministry.
[2224.58 --> 2227.58]  Why did he ask a question like that?
[2227.58 --> 2231.58]  Because sin is tricky.
[2231.58 --> 2239.58]  Sin is tricky, and it has an incredible ability to blow our lives wide open.
[2239.58 --> 2244.58]  And so, Scripture is very clear about sin and about life.
[2244.58 --> 2248.58]  You'll either live in the light or you'll live in the dark.
[2248.58 --> 2253.58]  Proverbs, you'll either be a fool or you'll live in the wisdom.
[2253.58 --> 2256.58]  You'll be righteous or wicked.
[2256.58 --> 2259.58]  God wants us to live in the light.
[2259.58 --> 2268.58]  So today we're going to talk about one of the most incredible gifts that God gives a Christian community
[2268.58 --> 2271.58]  and gives us personally the gift of accountability.
[2271.58 --> 2277.58]  It's also one of the most difficult things because no one really loves accountability.
[2277.58 --> 2279.58]  I remember doing some marriage counseling.
[2279.58 --> 2287.58]  I was a pastor and we were talking about how, you know, sometimes you've got to call your spouse on stuff.
[2287.58 --> 2297.58]  And invariably, one of the people we are counseling saying, well, I don't really like being called out on my stuff.
[2297.58 --> 2299.58]  Yeah, well, duh.
[2299.58 --> 2300.58]  No one does.
[2300.58 --> 2302.58]  But that's accountability.
[2302.58 --> 2309.58]  Accountability is the grace to be called on our stuff so that we can live in the light.
[2309.58 --> 2319.58]  And so today we're going to look at a question, the very first question that God asks, where are you?
[2319.58 --> 2321.58]  So we're going to look at that this morning.
[2321.58 --> 2327.58]  And my hope today is not to smack you guys down with, oh, you should be better and you should be better people
[2327.58 --> 2332.58]  and you shouldn't sin so much, but rather that you might hear the heart of God this morning.
[2332.58 --> 2339.58]  That he is a God who wants us to have the life, but he also wants us to live in the light.
[2339.58 --> 2342.58]  So let's open our Bibles this morning to Genesis 3.
[2342.58 --> 2346.58]  I'll try to cruise along because it definitely isn't the coolest place.
[2346.58 --> 2350.58]  I mean, it is cool, but it's not cool if you know what I mean.
[2350.58 --> 2353.58]  So we will try to go at a pretty good clip.
[2353.58 --> 2358.58]  It's kind of like you don't want to go too fast, but you don't also want to go too slow.
[2358.58 --> 2362.58]  Because my kid's learning how to drive right now, so we were a little bit late to church.
[2362.58 --> 2366.58]  So it's kind of like I want you to go fast, but I don't want to go too fast.
[2366.58 --> 2369.58]  But we got here. Anyways, I digress.
[2369.58 --> 2374.58]  Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord God had made.
[2374.58 --> 2380.58]  And he said to the woman, did God really say you must not eat from any tree in the garden?
[2380.58 --> 2384.58]  Well, the woman said to the serpent, we may eat from the trees in the garden,
[2384.58 --> 2388.58]  but God did say you must not eat from the tree that is in the middle of the garden,
[2388.58 --> 2391.58]  and you must not touch it or you will die.
[2391.58 --> 2394.58]  You will not surely die, the serpent said to the woman.
[2394.58 --> 2398.58]  Huh! For God knows that when you eat of it, your eyes will be opened,
[2398.58 --> 2401.58]  and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.
[2401.58 --> 2406.58]  Well, when the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye,
[2406.58 --> 2410.58]  and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it.
[2410.58 --> 2414.58]  She also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate it.
[2414.58 --> 2418.58]  Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked.
[2418.58 --> 2422.58]  So they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.
[2422.58 --> 2425.58]  Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God
[2425.58 --> 2428.58]  as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day,
[2428.58 --> 2431.58]  and they hid from the Lord.
[2431.58 --> 2433.58]  They hid from the Lord God among the trees of the garden,
[2433.58 --> 2436.58]  but the Lord God called to the man,
[2436.58 --> 2438.58]  Where? Let's say it all together.
[2438.58 --> 2440.58]  Where are you?
[2440.58 --> 2441.58]  He answered,
[2441.58 --> 2445.58]  Well, I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid.
[2445.58 --> 2447.58]  And he said,
[2447.58 --> 2448.58]  Another question.
[2448.58 --> 2450.58]  Who told you that you were naked?
[2450.58 --> 2453.58]  Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?
[2453.58 --> 2455.58]  That's the third question.
[2455.58 --> 2456.58]  Well, the man said,
[2456.58 --> 2460.58]  Well, the woman you put me here.
[2460.58 --> 2462.58]  What a guy.
[2462.58 --> 2466.58]  She gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.
[2466.58 --> 2468.58]  Well, then the Lord said to the woman,
[2468.58 --> 2470.58]  What is this you've done?
[2470.58 --> 2471.58]  The woman said,
[2471.58 --> 2473.58]  Well, the serpent deceived me, and I ate.
[2473.58 --> 2475.58]  So the Lord God said to the serpent,
[2475.58 --> 2477.58]  Because you have done this,
[2477.58 --> 2480.58]  Cursed are you above all livestock and all the wild animals.
[2480.58 --> 2481.58]  You'll crawl on your belly.
[2481.58 --> 2484.58]  You will eat dust all the days of your life.
[2484.58 --> 2486.58]  I'll put enmity between you and the woman,
[2486.58 --> 2488.58]  and between your offspring and hers.
[2488.58 --> 2491.58]  He'll crush your head, and you will strike his heel.
[2491.58 --> 2492.58]  To the woman he said,
[2492.58 --> 2495.58]  I'll greatly increase your pains and childbearing.
[2495.58 --> 2497.58]  With pain you'll give birth to children.
[2497.58 --> 2500.58]  Your desire will be for your husband, and he'll rule over you.
[2500.58 --> 2501.58]  And to Adam he said,
[2501.58 --> 2505.58]  Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you,
[2505.58 --> 2507.58]  You must not eat of it.
[2507.58 --> 2509.58]  Cursed is the ground because of you.
[2509.58 --> 2513.58]  Through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.
[2513.58 --> 2517.58]  It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.
[2517.58 --> 2521.58]  By the sweat of your brow you'll eat your food until you return to the ground.
[2521.58 --> 2526.58]  Since from it you were taken, for dust you are, and to dust you will return.
[2526.58 --> 2528.58]  This is where we're going to stop.
[2528.58 --> 2531.58]  Now let's get over to James 5.
[2531.58 --> 2534.58]  This is a letter for an early church.
[2535.58 --> 2538.58]  And we'll read 13 to 20.
[2538.58 --> 2540.58]  Is any of you in trouble? He should pray.
[2540.58 --> 2543.58]  Is anyone happy? Let him sing songs of praise.
[2543.58 --> 2545.58]  Is anyone of you sick? He should call the elders of the church
[2545.58 --> 2549.58]  To pray over him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord.
[2549.58 --> 2553.58]  And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well.
[2553.58 --> 2556.58]  The Lord will raise him up. If he has sinned, he'll be forgiven.
[2556.58 --> 2561.58]  Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed.
[2561.58 --> 2564.58]  The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.
[2564.58 --> 2566.58]  Elijah was a man just like us.
[2566.58 --> 2571.58]  He prayed earnestly that it wouldn't rain, and it didn't rain on the land for three and a half years.
[2571.58 --> 2575.58]  Again he prayed, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth produced its crops.
[2575.58 --> 2580.58]  My brothers, if one of you should wander from the truth, and someone should bring him back, remember this.
[2580.58 --> 2587.58]  Whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way will save him from death and cover over a multitude of sins.
[2587.58 --> 2591.58]  This is the word of God for us this morning. Praise be to God.
[2591.58 --> 2597.58]  So I want to make a little bit of a case for accountability this morning.
[2597.58 --> 2604.58]  So you've just seen, and for many of us we've read the story so many times.
[2604.58 --> 2610.58]  We've been reminded of the stark reality of sin in our lives.
[2610.58 --> 2613.58]  And how it breaks everything.
[2613.58 --> 2617.58]  In the first story it breaks the relationship with God.
[2617.58 --> 2621.58]  And it breaks the relationship between man and woman.
[2621.58 --> 2623.58]  Right? They start blaming each other.
[2623.58 --> 2627.58]  And it also breaks the relationship that Adam and Eve would have with creation.
[2627.58 --> 2632.58]  There would be toil, and thorns and thistles, and all that.
[2632.58 --> 2647.58]  And what we remember is that when it comes to sin, no matter how big our sin is, big or small, sin results in incredible isolation, alienation, and shame.
[2647.58 --> 2655.58]  We're going to have the elements this morning, the Lord's Supper, and we're reminded that Jesus came to save us from our sins.
[2655.58 --> 2660.58]  So sin is a big deal. It's always been a big deal, no matter how much we poo-poo it, and oh, it's not that bad.
[2660.58 --> 2662.58]  It's a big deal. It's the biggest deal.
[2662.58 --> 2665.58]  Otherwise we wouldn't have needed a savior.
[2665.58 --> 2672.58]  But when we look at this story, we see what happens to this first couple when they sin.
[2672.58 --> 2674.58]  Almost instantaneously.
[2674.58 --> 2679.58]  What happens? They sin, and all of a sudden they realize they're naked.
[2679.58 --> 2681.58]  They make clothes.
[2681.58 --> 2683.58]  They cover up.
[2683.58 --> 2686.58]  Then what do they do?
[2686.58 --> 2688.58]  They go hide away in the trees.
[2688.58 --> 2695.58]  And so the first thing we see, or the big thing we see about sin, is that sin forces us under cover.
[2695.58 --> 2701.58]  Now remember, one of the beauties of the garden, maybe the most beautiful thing, is that you could live out in the open.
[2701.58 --> 2703.58]  You could bear all.
[2703.58 --> 2706.58]  You know, as kids, we always used to remember, oh, they were naked.
[2706.58 --> 2708.58]  It's funny they're naked.
[2708.58 --> 2711.58]  Well, naked is also symbolic.
[2711.58 --> 2713.58]  They could bear all.
[2713.58 --> 2714.58]  They didn't have to hide.
[2714.58 --> 2716.58]  They could be who they were.
[2716.58 --> 2720.58]  No pretending, no masks, no cover-ups, no insecurities.
[2720.58 --> 2722.58]  They could just be.
[2722.58 --> 2723.58]  No shame.
[2723.58 --> 2724.58]  It was amazing.
[2724.58 --> 2725.58]  They could just be who they were.
[2725.58 --> 2728.58]  And they could be who God designed them to be.
[2728.58 --> 2732.58]  The first thing that comes, when sin comes, is they hide.
[2732.58 --> 2733.58]  They cover up.
[2733.58 --> 2735.58]  They layer up.
[2735.58 --> 2742.58]  Now you're here today, probably, one of the reasons you're here today, because you know you need God.
[2742.58 --> 2744.58]  You know you're a sinner.
[2744.58 --> 2747.58]  You know you need the saving grace of God.
[2747.58 --> 2754.58]  But what you should also know about sin is, sin and shame are inseparable.
[2754.58 --> 2759.58]  And the more we sin, the more we hide.
[2759.58 --> 2763.58]  And the more we hide, the less we become.
[2763.58 --> 2771.58]  To the point that when all the layers keep coming on, the more we start unbecoming who God designed us to be.
[2771.58 --> 2774.58]  I think of the great time traveler, Marty McFly.
[2774.58 --> 2776.58]  Remember Marty McFly?
[2776.58 --> 2780.58]  Now I'm going to probably reveal the plot here.
[2780.58 --> 2782.58]  It's 40 years old, the movie.
[2782.58 --> 2783.58]  So I don't feel bad.
[2783.58 --> 2789.58]  If you haven't seen it yet, Marty McFly goes back into the future.
[2789.58 --> 2790.58]  He goes back into the past.
[2790.58 --> 2793.58]  He kind of messes up his parents' destiny.
[2793.58 --> 2796.58]  And then he's got to kind of put everything back on the rails.
[2796.58 --> 2799.58]  But the problem is, he's got to face a big bully.
[2799.58 --> 2801.58]  He's got to orchestrate this whole thing.
[2801.58 --> 2803.58]  And he's losing courage.
[2803.58 --> 2804.58]  And remember, he has this picture.
[2804.58 --> 2807.58]  And he's looking at this picture of his family.
[2807.58 --> 2813.58]  And whenever his courage wanes and he feels like he can't pull this off, all the members of his family disappear.
[2813.58 --> 2821.58]  But then, when he starts having courage to be able to put this thing back together, all the family members come back.
[2821.58 --> 2823.58]  Right? They become.
[2823.58 --> 2825.58]  This is what sin does.
[2825.58 --> 2828.58]  Sin unbecomes us.
[2828.58 --> 2830.58]  Sin steals our humanity.
[2830.58 --> 2832.58]  It unravels us.
[2832.58 --> 2836.58]  It takes away who God designs us to be.
[2836.58 --> 2840.58]  And so the need for accountability.
[2840.58 --> 2846.58]  We need the question, where are you?
[2846.58 --> 2848.58]  Now isn't that interesting?
[2848.58 --> 2850.58]  That's the first question that God asks.
[2850.58 --> 2852.58]  Do you think God was perplexed?
[2852.58 --> 2854.58]  Oh, I wonder where they were.
[2854.58 --> 2855.58]  Where are those two people?
[2855.58 --> 2857.58]  Only two people on the planet.
[2857.58 --> 2859.58]  I created everything.
[2859.58 --> 2860.58]  No.
[2860.58 --> 2861.58]  God knows where they are.
[2861.58 --> 2863.58]  This is a question of grace.
[2863.58 --> 2868.58]  God wants them back in the open.
[2868.58 --> 2869.58]  They open.
[2869.58 --> 2872.58]  And so he says, hey.
[2872.58 --> 2874.58]  He's coming to them.
[2874.58 --> 2876.58]  Hey, where are you guys?
[2876.58 --> 2878.58]  I want you back.
[2878.58 --> 2881.58]  And so it's an awesome question to ask.
[2881.58 --> 2882.58]  Where are you?
[2882.58 --> 2884.58]  Where are you at?
[2884.58 --> 2887.58]  Where are you at in your life?
[2887.58 --> 2889.58]  Where are you at in your relationship with God?
[2889.58 --> 2892.58]  Sometimes we ask, where are you at in your finances?
[2892.58 --> 2896.58]  Sometimes we ask, where are you at with your steps?
[2896.58 --> 2900.58]  We have stupid watches that even tell us to stand up now.
[2900.58 --> 2902.58]  It's time to stand, you lazy blank.
[2902.58 --> 2908.58]  Even our watches do that.
[2908.58 --> 2911.58]  But the question is a question of grace.
[2911.58 --> 2915.58]  It's an invitation to live out in the open.
[2915.58 --> 2918.58]  It's an invitation to not live in the shadows.
[2918.58 --> 2919.58]  Because let's face it.
[2919.58 --> 2922.58]  Just because you're a Christian, that doesn't mean that you don't tamper.
[2922.58 --> 2924.58]  That sin doesn't get you.
[2924.58 --> 2927.58]  That sin doesn't get you in your clutches.
[2927.58 --> 2929.58]  You hide things.
[2929.58 --> 2931.58]  You live in the secret.
[2931.58 --> 2932.58]  In the secrets.
[2932.58 --> 2938.58]  And so the question of accountability, or the thing that this question gets to,
[2938.58 --> 2943.58]  is the heart of God that says, people of God, I want you to live out in the open.
[2945.58 --> 2946.58]  I don't want you pretending.
[2946.58 --> 2948.58]  I don't want you in shame.
[2950.58 --> 2954.58]  And so even for maybe some of you this morning, you're like, is it even possible?
[2954.58 --> 2955.58]  Like, I got this secret.
[2955.58 --> 2957.58]  I got this sin in my life.
[2957.58 --> 2958.58]  Yes!
[2958.58 --> 2960.58]  It's why Jesus came.
[2960.58 --> 2963.58]  Oh, Jesus came only to bring us to heaven.
[2963.58 --> 2964.58]  No!
[2964.58 --> 2966.58]  Jesus came to give you life.
[2966.58 --> 2968.58]  And life in the full.
[2968.58 --> 2970.58]  John 8, 12.
[2970.58 --> 2973.58]  I am the light of the world.
[2973.58 --> 2978.58]  Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.
[2979.58 --> 2981.58]  He wants us in the light.
[2981.58 --> 2983.58]  Isn't that awesome?
[2983.58 --> 2984.58]  Isn't that awesome?
[2984.58 --> 2987.58]  So even today, you're like, man, I'm so stuck right now in my sin.
[2987.58 --> 2988.58]  I don't know what to do.
[2988.58 --> 2990.58]  I do this stupid thing over again.
[2990.58 --> 2993.58]  Jesus says, okay.
[2993.58 --> 2994.58]  Where are you at?
[2994.58 --> 2999.58]  So, that's the case for accountability.
[2999.58 --> 3001.58]  We want to live in the light.
[3001.58 --> 3003.58]  What exactly is accountability?
[3003.58 --> 3007.58]  Now, there's a couple definitions of what accountability is.
[3007.58 --> 3012.58]  But ultimately, accountability is being answerable to someone else.
[3012.58 --> 3013.58]  Okay?
[3013.58 --> 3016.58]  So, you've heard this question before, if you're a married person probably.
[3016.58 --> 3019.58]  Honey, where are we at with the MasterCard?
[3019.58 --> 3022.58]  Hate that question.
[3022.58 --> 3023.58]  Silence.
[3023.58 --> 3024.58]  Silence.
[3024.58 --> 3030.58]  Or, we ask our kids, where's your report card?
[3030.58 --> 3033.58]  Now, as kids, we hid it under the waterbed mattress.
[3036.58 --> 3038.58]  Or, your kids, where's your phone?
[3038.58 --> 3041.58]  Because parents, you should be looking at their phones.
[3041.58 --> 3046.58]  Sometimes in my house, it's my wife asks me, where did all the cinnamon buns go?
[3048.58 --> 3053.58]  Ultimately, accountability is being answerable to someone.
[3053.58 --> 3056.58]  To God, to a friend, to accountability partner.
[3060.58 --> 3062.58]  Often, it creates tension.
[3063.58 --> 3067.58]  Because you've got to, on your side, when you answer the question,
[3067.58 --> 3069.58]  you've kind of got to lay yourself bare.
[3069.58 --> 3071.58]  Or, you could lie, which isn't cool.
[3071.58 --> 3072.58]  And that won't get you anywhere.
[3074.58 --> 3075.58]  And so, yeah, it can be tense.
[3075.58 --> 3077.58]  The MasterCard, that's overdue.
[3077.58 --> 3078.58]  We should probably get caught up.
[3078.58 --> 3080.58]  Ah, my report card, I think it's under the mattress.
[3080.58 --> 3083.58]  And, well, the cinnamon buns, the dog ate those again.
[3087.58 --> 3091.58]  But the reality is, with accountability, is, you've got to own up to the question.
[3095.58 --> 3099.58]  Ultimately, accountability is the process and the commitment
[3099.58 --> 3102.58]  of getting ourselves out in the open as much as we can.
[3102.58 --> 3106.58]  This is what Paul says in 2 Corinthians 4.2.
[3106.58 --> 3111.58]  Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways.
[3111.58 --> 3113.58]  We don't use deception.
[3113.58 --> 3114.58]  We don't live in that life anymore.
[3114.58 --> 3115.58]  That's not the life.
[3115.58 --> 3116.58]  That's the dark life.
[3116.58 --> 3118.58]  We're called to the light life.
[3118.58 --> 3121.58]  And so, we live out in the open as hard as that can be.
[3121.58 --> 3124.58]  As hard as those questions can be.
[3124.58 --> 3129.58]  And the more we live out in the open, the better we live and the more we flourish.
[3131.58 --> 3135.58]  The alternative question is, what happens when we don't live with accountability?
[3136.58 --> 3137.58]  So, I'll ask you this.
[3137.58 --> 3139.58]  What happens when the government isn't held accountable?
[3139.58 --> 3144.58]  You can mutter about yourselves.
[3144.58 --> 3145.58]  About that one.
[3146.58 --> 3149.58]  What happens when students in the classroom aren't held accountable?
[3149.58 --> 3152.58]  You know, we have this debate right now in our province.
[3152.58 --> 3153.58]  I don't know another.
[3153.58 --> 3156.58]  But kids don't get grades until like grade 10.
[3156.58 --> 3160.58]  And I was talking to a nursing professor at a school in British Columbia.
[3160.58 --> 3166.58]  And she said, literally, when some of these kids are getting into the nursing school,
[3166.58 --> 3169.58]  it's the first time that they can get a pass-fail grade.
[3169.58 --> 3172.58]  Now, I don't know about you, but I kind of want to, if I may have a nurse,
[3172.58 --> 3175.58]  I kind of want to know that they passed or failed something.
[3175.58 --> 3176.58]  Right?
[3176.58 --> 3183.58]  And this person said that there's almost a crisis of anxiety now for a lot of these people
[3183.58 --> 3188.58]  who come into nursing school because they've never passed or had to pass or fail anything.
[3188.58 --> 3192.58]  And she said, in some of these kids, it brings them to near suicide.
[3192.58 --> 3197.58]  I mean, no life of accountability?
[3197.58 --> 3201.58]  What happens when we don't hold ourselves financially accountable?
[3201.58 --> 3206.58]  Then we end up on a Sands & Associates commercial or whatever that's called, right?
[3206.58 --> 3209.58]  I mean, ultimately, you've got to pay the piper.
[3209.58 --> 3212.58]  What happens when we don't hold our kids accountable?
[3212.58 --> 3217.58]  Well, with all of those instances, everything goes to hell.
[3217.58 --> 3222.58]  Now, remember the setting of our story.
[3222.58 --> 3223.58]  It's a garden.
[3223.58 --> 3225.58]  Who here is a gardener?
[3225.58 --> 3226.58]  Anybody is a gardener here?
[3226.58 --> 3228.58]  You like garden?
[3228.58 --> 3229.58]  Yeah, yeah.
[3229.58 --> 3230.58]  Oh, yes, you're a big gardener.
[3230.58 --> 3231.58]  Yeah.
[3231.58 --> 3236.58]  I, the other day, I left my hose out on the lawn for a week.
[3236.58 --> 3239.58]  Not on, but like on and on.
[3239.58 --> 3240.58]  It has a timer on it.
[3240.58 --> 3243.58]  And then, you know what happened when I pulled the hose away?
[3243.58 --> 3247.58]  There's a big line of death, right?
[3247.58 --> 3251.58]  So a garden is all about light.
[3251.58 --> 3255.58]  Most plants, the more light you give them, the better they do.
[3255.58 --> 3258.58]  That's what accountability is.
[3258.58 --> 3263.58]  Accountability, even in the case of the hose, where all the grass is now alive again because it got back into the light.
[3263.58 --> 3266.58]  The whole point of accountability is you living in the light.
[3266.58 --> 3272.58]  And so the question this morning for you, it's very personal.
[3272.58 --> 3274.58]  I can ask it because I'm not your pastor.
[3274.58 --> 3276.58]  Where are you?
[3276.58 --> 3278.58]  Where are you in your life?
[3278.58 --> 3280.58]  Where are you in your marriage?
[3280.58 --> 3282.58]  Where are you in your sexuality?
[3282.58 --> 3286.58]  Where are you with your secrets?
[3286.58 --> 3292.58]  What are you hiding?
[3292.58 --> 3296.58]  Now maybe it's something that happened to you as a child.
[3296.58 --> 3298.58]  Or maybe it's a certain trauma that you had.
[3298.58 --> 3300.58]  Or maybe it's a trauma you gave someone out and the guilt has you.
[3300.58 --> 3302.58]  It grips you.
[3302.58 --> 3307.58]  Do you know that you don't have to have that in your life anymore?
[3307.58 --> 3309.58]  Do you know that's why Jesus came?
[3309.58 --> 3311.58]  So that you could live in the light?
[3311.58 --> 3315.58]  So that you could know the light and the life?
[3315.58 --> 3318.58]  Maybe you're loneliness.
[3318.58 --> 3321.58]  Maybe you're lonely and loneliness has you.
[3321.58 --> 3325.58]  And you feel so stupid telling people, I feel lonely.
[3325.58 --> 3328.58]  God wants us to live out in the open.
[3328.58 --> 3329.58]  And the cross proves it.
[3329.58 --> 3331.58]  You know, it's very interesting.
[3331.58 --> 3334.58]  Adam and Eve, they go hide under the trees.
[3334.58 --> 3337.58]  Jesus bears himself on a tree.
[3337.58 --> 3340.58]  So that we could live out in the open.
[3340.58 --> 3343.58]  So that we could live.
[3343.58 --> 3350.58]  He became sin who knew no sin that we might become the righteousness of God.
[3350.58 --> 3354.58]  So again, the case for accountability, what it is.
[3354.58 --> 3357.58]  Now I'm going to land the plane here and hopefully we're not too hot.
[3357.58 --> 3359.58]  What does Christian accountability look like?
[3359.58 --> 3364.58]  So James says this.
[3364.58 --> 3369.58]  Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed.
[3369.58 --> 3373.58]  First of all, and I don't have a PowerPoint, so just imagine it's there.
[3373.58 --> 3378.58]  First of all, Christian accountability looks like being personally accountable.
[3382.58 --> 3384.58]  As Reformed Christians, we talk a lot about grace.
[3384.58 --> 3385.58]  Oh, it's all grace.
[3385.58 --> 3386.58]  It's all grace.
[3386.58 --> 3387.58]  It's all grace.
[3387.58 --> 3388.58]  It is.
[3388.58 --> 3389.58]  It's all grace.
[3389.58 --> 3392.58]  But that doesn't mean it's cheap grace.
[3392.58 --> 3396.58]  Christianity is about taking responsibility for your own faith.
[3396.58 --> 3398.58]  Isn't that interesting?
[3398.58 --> 3400.58]  God gives us the keys.
[3400.58 --> 3403.58]  He says, he calls us to steward our own faith.
[3403.58 --> 3406.58]  I remember talking to a guy one time when I was a pastor and he says,
[3406.58 --> 3407.58]  Oh, I don't worry about faith.
[3407.58 --> 3409.58]  My grandpa was a pastor.
[3409.58 --> 3411.58]  Okay, cool.
[3411.58 --> 3412.58]  I don't even know what to do with that.
[3412.58 --> 3413.58]  Okay, see ya.
[3413.58 --> 3415.58]  I don't know what to do with that.
[3415.58 --> 3420.58]  It's not about your husband or your wife dragging you to church, praying for you.
[3420.58 --> 3422.58]  It's not about your mom taking you to church.
[3422.58 --> 3427.58]  At some point, if you confess in Jesus Christ, you become the steward of your faith.
[3427.58 --> 3431.58]  And Paul says it in Ephesians.
[3431.58 --> 3432.58]  Right?
[3432.58 --> 3435.58]  He says, work out your salvation with fear and trembling.
[3437.58 --> 3439.58]  James says, confess your sins.
[3439.58 --> 3441.58]  Not someone else's sins.
[3441.58 --> 3442.58]  That's gossip.
[3442.58 --> 3444.58]  Confess your sins.
[3444.58 --> 3453.58]  And so it's understanding that we have in our own hands our faith life.
[3453.58 --> 3457.58]  Secondly, it looks like being communally accountable.
[3457.58 --> 3461.58]  So as we see in this story, the sin was committed in community, really.
[3461.58 --> 3462.58]  Oh, hey, you want some?
[3462.58 --> 3463.58]  Okay.
[3463.58 --> 3468.58]  Accountability works best in community.
[3468.58 --> 3472.58]  After Adam and Eve, come the people of Israel.
[3472.58 --> 3474.58]  Long time after, come the people of Israel.
[3474.58 --> 3476.58]  And they have something called the law.
[3476.58 --> 3477.58]  Right?
[3477.58 --> 3478.58]  And people are confused.
[3478.58 --> 3479.58]  Is the law good?
[3479.58 --> 3480.58]  Is the law bad?
[3480.58 --> 3481.58]  We're Christians.
[3481.58 --> 3482.58]  Do we obey the law?
[3482.58 --> 3483.58]  Is it good or it's bad?
[3483.58 --> 3484.58]  It's good.
[3484.58 --> 3486.58]  Because the law tells you where you are.
[3486.58 --> 3491.58]  If you read the Ten Commandments, and if you realize everybody obeyed those things,
[3491.58 --> 3493.58]  we live in a pretty good world.
[3493.58 --> 3495.58]  And so the law is good.
[3495.58 --> 3497.58]  The problem is, without the Spirit, we can't obey the law.
[3497.58 --> 3503.58]  But in the Old Testament system, the law told everybody where they were.
[3503.58 --> 3504.58]  Hey, you did that.
[3504.58 --> 3505.58]  Oh yeah, I know I did that.
[3505.58 --> 3506.58]  Sorry, pray for me.
[3506.58 --> 3507.58]  Yes.
[3507.58 --> 3509.58]  That's where the sacrificial system was.
[3509.58 --> 3516.58]  You brought in little Lammy to the temple, put your hand on his head, and that accounted
[3516.58 --> 3517.58]  for your sin.
[3517.58 --> 3519.58]  Because your sin was a big deal.
[3519.58 --> 3522.58]  But it was done in community.
[3522.58 --> 3525.58]  And so, we do it in community.
[3525.58 --> 3531.58]  And I think one of the simple ways to do accountability is just come to church on a Sunday morning.
[3531.58 --> 3533.58]  There's just something about coming to church.
[3533.58 --> 3537.58]  And realizing that you sit under someone else's authority.
[3537.58 --> 3544.58]  Just coming, I remember so often as a pastor, if someone wouldn't come to church for a couple weeks,
[3544.58 --> 3548.58]  and he'd be like, hey pastor, I want to know where I was the last couple weeks.
[3548.58 --> 3549.58]  No.
[3549.58 --> 3554.58]  But there was this innate desire to say, hey, this is where we were.
[3554.58 --> 3555.58]  But this is where I am.
[3555.58 --> 3557.58]  I think that's good, by the way.
[3557.58 --> 3558.58]  That's good.
[3560.58 --> 3564.58]  And I mean, you do know why people in our times don't go to church, right?
[3564.58 --> 3566.58]  It's not schedule problems.
[3566.58 --> 3569.58]  It's not, aw, they're all just a bunch of hypocrites.
[3569.58 --> 3570.58]  It's accountability.
[3570.58 --> 3573.58]  People don't want to be held accountable.
[3573.58 --> 3577.58]  People are believing the gospel of, I am my own person.
[3577.58 --> 3579.58]  And I make my own decisions.
[3579.58 --> 3581.58]  And my right is my right.
[3581.58 --> 3583.58]  And your right is your right.
[3583.58 --> 3585.58]  They want to be held accountable.
[3585.58 --> 3589.58]  So simply committing to church is accountability.
[3589.58 --> 3592.58]  Secondly, though, it goes deeper.
[3592.58 --> 3597.58]  To be in more intimate accountability relationships.
[3597.58 --> 3600.58]  You do know that it was 12 guys that changed the world, right?
[3600.58 --> 3603.58]  And when you read the gospels,
[3603.58 --> 3607.58]  when you read the gospels, you see a lot of accountability going on.
[3607.58 --> 3610.58]  Jesus is not afraid to rebuke the disciples.
[3610.58 --> 3617.58]  And after Jesus leaves, these guys form a union, except for Judas, so 11 and then 12.
[3617.58 --> 3622.58]  They form a union and they create a culture of accountability.
[3622.58 --> 3623.58]  You even see it in the New Testament.
[3623.58 --> 3629.58]  There's a time when Paul holds Peter accountable.
[3629.58 --> 3633.58]  There's accountability, even in this small letter of James.
[3633.58 --> 3635.58]  Confess your sins to each other.
[3635.58 --> 3636.58]  Open up.
[3636.58 --> 3639.58]  And so it's a small group thing too.
[3639.58 --> 3640.58]  And I don't know if your church does small groups.
[3640.58 --> 3642.58]  I know our church did it for a little while.
[3642.58 --> 3643.58]  We struggled.
[3643.58 --> 3645.58]  But the whole point is to have people in our lives to say,
[3645.58 --> 3647.58]  Hey, where are you at?
[3647.58 --> 3649.58]  How can I pray for you?
[3649.58 --> 3654.58]  Lastly, lastly, so you'd be accountable to yourself.
[3654.58 --> 3656.58]  Because you steward your faith.
[3656.58 --> 3658.58]  You're accountable together.
[3658.58 --> 3659.58]  So small groups is good.
[3659.58 --> 3661.58]  Sign up if you have small groups.
[3661.58 --> 3664.58]  But lastly, it's being accountable to God.
[3664.58 --> 3668.58]  Are you open to the spirit working in your life?
[3668.58 --> 3671.58]  Oh, I'm just so busy though.
[3671.58 --> 3673.58]  So busy.
[3673.58 --> 3675.58]  And I'd have people say to me,
[3675.58 --> 3677.58]  Oh, I'm not a reader.
[3677.58 --> 3679.58]  Oh, okay.
[3679.58 --> 3681.58]  Well, that's a great excuse.
[3681.58 --> 3682.58]  I'm not a reader.
[3682.58 --> 3683.58]  No, it's not.
[3683.58 --> 3684.58]  It's not a good excuse.
[3684.58 --> 3687.58]  We're in relationship with God.
[3687.58 --> 3690.58]  And so, do you know when the spirit speaks?
[3690.58 --> 3693.58]  So for instance, when you're reading the Bible in the morning.
[3693.58 --> 3694.58]  By the way, I like Dick's idea.
[3694.58 --> 3695.58]  I do this every morning.
[3695.58 --> 3697.58]  I have my Bible and my coffee every morning.
[3697.58 --> 3700.58]  One thing I love and one thing that's really hard.
[3700.58 --> 3704.58]  And I open the Bible and as soon as something jumps out of the page,
[3704.58 --> 3706.58]  It's like, I think God spoke to me today.
[3706.58 --> 3708.58]  I should probably do that.
[3708.58 --> 3710.58]  Or if you're in a situation where you're like,
[3710.58 --> 3712.58]  I just said something stupid.
[3712.58 --> 3714.58]  That's probably the Holy Spirit speaking.
[3714.58 --> 3716.58]  Or maybe your wife.
[3716.58 --> 3717.58]  Right?
[3717.58 --> 3719.58]  But are you open?
[3719.58 --> 3722.58]  Are you open to the fact that God is with you?
[3722.58 --> 3724.58]  And he's speaking all the time.
[3724.58 --> 3725.58]  Through the radio station.
[3725.58 --> 3726.58]  Through friends.
[3726.58 --> 3727.58]  Through the preacher.
[3727.58 --> 3729.58]  Through your devotional times.
[3729.58 --> 3731.58]  And are you able to say, God, you're right?
[3733.58 --> 3735.58]  So in close this morning,
[3737.58 --> 3739.58]  Couple questions.
[3739.58 --> 3740.58]  That you can go home with.
[3740.58 --> 3743.58]  Maybe have lunch and talk about it with your friends or whatever.
[3743.58 --> 3748.58]  Are you at this moment in your life living more in the light?
[3748.58 --> 3750.58]  Or more in the dark?
[3754.58 --> 3759.58]  Who is one person in your life you feel like you can be totally open with?
[3759.58 --> 3762.58]  And,
[3762.58 --> 3768.58]  How can you make your church a place of openness and accountability?
[3769.58 --> 3771.58]  Will you join with me in prayer?
[3773.58 --> 3775.58]  God, we thank you so much for your grace.
[3778.58 --> 3780.58]  And we have this picture, Lord.
[3780.58 --> 3790.58]  We're reminded of this picture that these two people, our forerunners, our oldest parents.
[3791.58 --> 3795.58]  They sin, they cover up, and they hide.
[3796.58 --> 3799.58]  And we have the picture of a cross of a Savior who is naked.
[3799.58 --> 3804.58]  And all out in the open on a rugged cross.
[3807.58 --> 3813.58]  So that we too might live out in the open and know your love and your life and your light.
[3814.58 --> 3817.58]  All of us in this room struggle, Lord.
[3817.58 --> 3818.58]  We struggle with our sin.
[3819.58 --> 3820.58]  We struggle with shame.
[3820.58 --> 3834.58]  And we ask, Lord, by your Spirit that you might help us and call us to a place where we can have a friend in our life or a pastor or something so that we too can live in such a place where we can live with life and light.
[3835.58 --> 3836.58]  We thank you, Lord.
[3837.58 --> 3838.58]  In your name.
[3839.58 --> 3840.58]  Amen.
[3840.58 --> 3841.58]  Amen.
[3841.58 --> 3842.58]  Amen.
[3842.58 --> 3843.58]  Amen.
[3843.58 --> 3844.58]  Amen.
[3846.58 --> 3847.58]  Turn a little pitch.
[3848.58 --> 3849.58]  Amen.
[3849.58 --> 3850.58]  Amen.
[3850.58 --> 3852.58]  Amen.
[3852.58 --> 3854.58]  Amen.
[3854.58 --> 3855.58]  Amen.
[3855.58 --> 3857.58]  Amen.
[3857.58 --> 3861.58]  Amen.
[3861.58 --> 3864.58]  Amen.
[3864.58 --> 3865.58]  Amen.
[3865.58 --> 3866.58]  Amen.
[3866.58 --> 3869.58]  Amen.
[3869.58 --> 3870.58]  Amen.
[3870.58 --> 3874.26]  whether it's lunch, whether it's a donut from Tim Hortons,
[3874.28 --> 3875.14]  which is my preference,
[3876.36 --> 3878.88]  whenever you sit down and eat with someone,
[3878.98 --> 3881.08]  you're telling them one profound thing.
[3882.08 --> 3884.00]  I want you to live.
[3885.58 --> 3887.00]  Now, I think it's kind of cool today.
[3887.66 --> 3889.88]  I've been tempted to look through a couple of these bags
[3889.88 --> 3891.36]  to see what kind of snacks we have.
[3892.24 --> 3895.32]  But I think it's very cool that your church is communicating
[3895.32 --> 3898.32]  to your culture and to your community
[3898.32 --> 3900.56]  that you very much want them to live.
[3900.58 --> 3904.30]  Well, that's what this meal is all about.
[3906.68 --> 3908.78]  You know, when the disciples came with Jesus
[3908.78 --> 3912.00]  and they sat down to the last meal,
[3912.16 --> 3913.98]  remember, they were thinking revolution, right?
[3914.36 --> 3917.10]  They were thinking, this guy's going to be the king
[3917.10 --> 3918.60]  who's going to topple the empire.
[3920.68 --> 3922.18]  So they were ready for conquest.
[3922.42 --> 3923.68]  They were so excited.
[3924.72 --> 3927.00]  But Jesus didn't want them just to have that life.
[3927.10 --> 3929.82]  He wanted them to have the real life, the true life.
[3930.58 --> 3932.52]  And what he was about to go through
[3932.52 --> 3934.08]  was going to make sure that happened.
[3935.46 --> 3937.46]  And so on the night that Jesus was betrayed,
[3937.60 --> 3938.68]  he took bread.
[3939.98 --> 3941.60]  And after he had given thanks,
[3941.66 --> 3942.82]  which always blows my mind,
[3942.88 --> 3944.14]  he knows he's about to go die,
[3944.60 --> 3946.02]  but after he had given thanks,
[3946.10 --> 3947.02]  he broke it and said,
[3947.12 --> 3948.66]  this is my body which is for you.
[3948.66 --> 3956.00]  And then he took what was then wine,
[3956.16 --> 3957.76]  which this is probably grape juice,
[3958.12 --> 3959.86]  and then he took the cup,
[3960.82 --> 3961.98]  and he said,
[3962.22 --> 3962.84]  this is the cup
[3962.84 --> 3967.68]  that signifies the new covenant in my blood.
[3970.08 --> 3970.66]  He says,
[3970.66 --> 3979.62]  And so,
[3979.62 --> 3981.98]  as you come up
[3981.98 --> 3983.36]  and you receive the elements,
[3984.80 --> 3985.74]  may you remember
[3985.74 --> 3988.76]  that God is the one
[3988.76 --> 3989.64]  who wants you to live,
[3990.46 --> 3991.36]  really live.
[3992.84 --> 3994.06]  How cool is that?
[3994.06 --> 3997.88]  Let's come up
[3997.88 --> 3999.24]  and have Lord's Supper together.
[3999.24 --> 4000.24]  Let's go.
[4021.24 --> 4021.60]  Oops,
[4021.80 --> 4022.24]  wrong one.
[4024.54 --> 4025.66]  How do I just give it to you?
[4027.54 --> 4027.92]  Sure.
[4027.92 --> 4029.64]  And then do I give it that one too?
[4029.78 --> 4031.08]  There's also gluten-free here.
[4031.68 --> 4032.90]  And then I pass it this way
[4032.90 --> 4033.44]  for you guys.
[4034.08 --> 4035.16]  This is the body of Christ
[4035.16 --> 4036.34]  broken for you
[4036.34 --> 4037.68]  for the forgiveness of your sins.
[4037.82 --> 4038.10]  Take,
[4038.52 --> 4038.72]  eat,
[4038.86 --> 4039.12]  remember,
[4039.18 --> 4039.58]  and believe.
[4039.68 --> 4040.02]  Go ahead.
[4047.24 --> 4047.60]  Okay.
[4047.60 --> 4047.72]  Okay.
[4048.22 --> 4048.38]  Okay.
[4057.92 --> 4068.80]  I can take that.
[4074.48 --> 4075.62]  The body of Christ
[4075.62 --> 4076.28]  shed for you.
[4077.00 --> 4077.24]  Take,
[4077.44 --> 4077.58]  eat,
[4077.64 --> 4078.02]  and believe.
[4078.02 --> 4091.88]  the blood of Christ.
[4108.02 --> 4130.18]  This is the blood of Christ poured out for you.
[4130.82 --> 4133.94]  Take, drink, remember, and believe.
[4133.94 --> 4134.40]  Go ahead.
[4138.02 --> 4145.92]  You may go in peace.
[4145.92 --> 4153.82]  Go ahead.
[4153.82 --> 4161.72]  Go ahead.
[4161.72 --> 4169.62]  Go ahead.
[4169.62 --> 4177.52]  Go ahead.
[4177.52 --> 4185.42]  Go ahead.
[4185.42 --> 4187.42]  Go ahead.
[4187.42 --> 4195.32]  Go ahead.
[4195.32 --> 4203.22]  Go ahead.
[4203.22 --> 4213.12]  Go ahead.
[4213.12 --> 4215.12]  Go ahead.
[4215.12 --> 4225.02]  Go ahead.
[4225.02 --> 4227.02]  Go ahead.
[4227.02 --> 4229.02]  Go ahead.
[4229.02 --> 4238.92]  Go ahead.
[4238.92 --> 4246.82]  Go ahead.
[4246.82 --> 4254.72]  Go ahead.
[4254.72 --> 4262.62]  Go ahead.
[4262.62 --> 4264.62]  Go ahead.
[4264.62 --> 4266.52]  Go ahead.
[4266.52 --> 4272.52]  Go ahead.
[4272.52 --> 4274.42]  Go ahead.
[4274.42 --> 4280.42]  Go ahead.
[4280.42 --> 4282.32]  Go ahead.
[4282.32 --> 4284.32]  Go ahead.
[4284.32 --> 4288.32]  Go ahead.
[4288.32 --> 4298.22]  Go ahead.
[4298.22 --> 4300.12]  Go ahead.
[4300.12 --> 4302.12]  пока.
[4302.12 --> 4305.44]  To hide His face
[4305.44 --> 4311.48]  I rest on His unchanging grace
[4311.48 --> 4317.72]  In every hide and stormy hail
[4317.72 --> 4322.88]  My anchor holds again the veil
[4322.88 --> 4329.04]  My anchor holds again the veil
[4329.04 --> 4338.08]  Christ alone, cornerstone
[4338.08 --> 4341.18]  Weak made strong
[4341.18 --> 4344.24]  Through the Savior's come
[4344.24 --> 4347.14]  Through the storm
[4347.14 --> 4354.44]  He is Lord, Lord of all
[4354.44 --> 4363.48]  When the door shall come with trumpet sound
[4363.48 --> 4369.34]  Oh, may I then in Him be found
[4369.34 --> 4375.58]  Rest in His righteousness alone
[4375.58 --> 4381.62]  Of this stand before the throne
[4381.62 --> 4390.66]  Christ alone, cornerstone
[4390.66 --> 4399.70]  Christ alone, cornerstone
[4399.70 --> 4403.70]  Weak made strong
[4403.70 --> 4404.98]  In the Savior's love
[4404.98 --> 4411.70]  Christ alone, cornerstone
[4411.70 --> 4412.74]  Weak made strong
[4412.74 --> 4415.74]  Weak made strong
[4415.74 --> 4418.96]  In the Savior's love
[4418.96 --> 4421.74]  Through the storm
[4421.74 --> 4428.74]  He is Lord, Lord of all
[4428.74 --> 4435.74]  Christ alone, cornerstone
[4435.74 --> 4436.78]  Weak made strong
[4436.78 --> 4438.78]  Weak made strong
[4438.78 --> 4439.78]  Weak made strong
[4439.78 --> 4441.78]  In the Savior's love
[4441.78 --> 4444.78]  Through the storm
[4444.78 --> 4451.78]  He is Lord, Lord of all
[4451.78 --> 4460.82]  He is Lord, Lord of all
[4460.82 --> 4463.82]  He is Lord, Lord of all
[4463.82 --> 4493.80]  Thank you.
[4493.82 --> 4514.70]  Your only Son, no sin to hide, but you have sent Him from your side to walk upon this guilty song and to become the Lamb of God.
[4514.70 --> 4523.70]  O Lamb of God, sweet Lamb of God, I love the Holy Lamb of God.
[4523.70 --> 4534.08]  O wash me in His precious blood, my Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God.
[4534.08 --> 4564.08] 
[4564.08 --> 4575.08]  O wash me in His precious blood, my Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God.
[4575.08 --> 4597.08]  I was so lost, I should have died, but you have brought me to your side to be led by your staff and brought, and to be called the Lamb of God.
[4597.08 --> 4607.28]  O Lamb of God, sweet Lamb of God, I love the Holy Lamb of God.
[4607.28 --> 4616.72]  O wash me in His precious blood, my Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God.
[4616.72 --> 4626.40]  O Lamb of God, sweet Lamb of God, I love the Holy Lamb of God.
[4626.40 --> 4636.40]  O wash me in His precious blood, my Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God.
[4636.40 --> 4643.40]  O wash me in His precious blood, my God.
[4643.40 --> 4647.40]  O wash me in His precious blood, my God.
[4647.40 --> 4653.40]  O wash me in His precious blood, my God.
[4653.40 --> 4670.40]  O wash me in His precious blood, my God.
[4670.40 --> 4674.40]  O wash me in His precious blood, my God.
[4674.40 --> 4678.40]  O wash me in His precious blood, my God.
[4678.40 --> 4700.40]  O wash me in His wise blood, my P clothing, my God.
[4700.40 --> 4722.16]  How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful is the body of Christ.
[4722.16 --> 4739.16]  How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful the heart that fled, that took all my sin and bore it instead.
[4739.16 --> 4752.16]  How beautiful, how beautiful the tender eyes that chose to forgive and never despise.
[4752.16 --> 4774.88]  How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful is the body of Christ.
[4774.88 --> 4786.88]  And as He laid down His life, we offer this sacrifice.
[4788.08 --> 4799.16]  That we will live just as He died, willing to pay the price.
[4799.16 --> 4805.16]  Willing to pay the price.
[4808.16 --> 4821.16]  How beautiful, the rage and pride, who waits for her groom with His light in her eyes.
[4821.16 --> 4828.38]  How beautiful, the new Lord's ear.
[4828.90 --> 4834.48]  The fruit of your eyes, so that others may live.
[4834.48 --> 4855.48]  How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful is the body of Christ.
[4855.48 --> 4869.26]  How beautiful, the heat that bring, the sound of good news and the love of the King.
[4869.26 --> 4876.26]  How beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful.
[4876.26 --> 4890.26]  How beautiful, how beautiful.
[4890.26 --> 4903.26]  How beautiful, how beautiful is the body of Christ.
[4903.26 --> 4905.92]  Praise the name.
[4905.92 --> 4906.92]  I'm God.
[4906.92 --> 4907.92]  You're a great friend.
[4907.92 --> 4909.92]  I'm going to pray.
[4909.92 --> 4910.92]  I'm going to pray.
[4910.92 --> 4911.92]  We're going to pray.
[4911.92 --> 4912.92]  Take me.
[4912.92 --> 4914.92]  Tara, we're going to go again.
[4914.92 --> 4916.92]  Amen.
[4944.92 --> 4946.92]  Amen.
[4946.92 --> 4948.92]  Amen.
[4948.92 --> 4950.92]  Amen.

[4956.92 --> 4958.92]  Amen.
[4958.92 --> 4960.92]  Amen.
[4960.92 --> 4973.92]  I cast my mind to Calvary, where Jesus blessed and died for me.
[4973.92 --> 4989.92]  I see His wounds, His hands, His feet, my Savior on that cursed tree.
[4989.92 --> 5003.92]  His body bound and drenched in tears, they laid Him down in Joseph's tomb.
[5003.92 --> 5017.92]  The entrance sealed by heavy stone, Messiah still and all alone.
[5017.92 --> 5019.92]  Amen.
[5019.92 --> 5026.92]  Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God.
[5026.92 --> 5032.92]  Oh, praise His name forevermore.
[5032.92 --> 5039.92]  For endless days we will sing Your praise.
[5039.92 --> 5045.92]  Oh, Lord, oh, Lord our God.
[5045.92 --> 5046.92]  Amen.
[5046.92 --> 5048.92]  Amen.
[5048.92 --> 5060.92]  Then on the third, at break of dawn, the Son of Heaven rose again.
[5060.92 --> 5067.92]  Oh, Trapped of Death, where is your sting?
[5067.92 --> 5073.92]  The angels roar for Christ the King.
[5073.92 --> 5083.92]  Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God.
[5083.92 --> 5089.92]  Oh, praise His name forevermore.
[5089.92 --> 5096.92]  For endless days we will sing Your praise.
[5096.92 --> 5102.92]  Oh, Lord, oh, Lord our God.
[5102.92 --> 5105.92]  Oh, praise His name forevermore.
[5105.92 --> 5111.92]  We shall return in robes of wine.
[5111.92 --> 5117.92]  The blazing sun shall pierce the night.
[5117.92 --> 5123.92]  And I will rise among the saints,
[5123.92 --> 5131.32]  my gaze transfixed on Jesus' face.
[5153.92 --> 5171.92]  O praise the name of the Lord our God, O praise His name forevermore.
[5171.92 --> 5182.92]  For endless days we will sing Your praise, O Lord, O Lord our God.
[5183.92 --> 5195.92]  O praise the name of the Lord our God, O praise His name forevermore.
[5195.92 --> 5206.92]  For endless days we will sing Your praise, O Lord, O Lord our God.
[5207.92 --> 5212.92]  O Lord, O Lord our God.
[5213.92 --> 5219.92]  O Lord, O Lord our God.
[5219.92 --> 5233.92]  And now may a dying Savior's love, a risen Savior's power, an ascended Savior's prayer, and a returning Savior's glory be with you and all whom you hold dear.
[5234.92 --> 5235.92]  Go in peace. Amen.
[5235.92 --> 5237.92]  Amen.
[5237.92 --> 5265.24]  Now unto the King eternal, unto the King immortal, unto the King immortal.
[5265.24 --> 5284.24]  The only wise God, the only wise God.
[5284.24 --> 5304.24]  The only wise God, the only wise God.
[5304.24 --> 5319.24]  invisible the only wise God the only wise God
[5319.24 --> 5334.24]  Oh unto the King be glory and honor unto the King forever
[5334.24 --> 5344.24]  unto the King be glory and honor forever
[5344.24 --> 5351.24]  and ever
[5351.24 --> 5355.24]  Amen
[5355.24 --> 5359.24]  Amen
[5359.24 --> 5363.24]  Amen
[5363.24 --> 5365.24]  Amen
[5374.24 --> 5385.24]  Amen
[5385.24 --> 5387.24]  Amen
[5387.24 --> 5417.22]  Thank you.
[5417.24 --> 5447.22]  Thank you.
[5447.24 --> 5477.22]  Thank you.
[5477.24 --> 5479.24]  Thank you.
[5507.24 --> 5509.24]  Thank you.
[5537.24 --> 5539.24]  Thank you.
[5567.24 --> 5569.24]  Thank you.
