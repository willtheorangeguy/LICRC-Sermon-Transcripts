[1940.00 --> 1946.38]  Open up my eyes in wonder and show me
[1946.38 --> 1952.74]  Who you are and fill me with your heart and lead me
[1952.74 --> 1958.10]  In your love to those around me
[1970.00 --> 1989.46]  I will build my life upon your love
[1989.46 --> 1993.84]  It is a firm foundation
[1993.84 --> 2001.84]  I will put my trust in you alone
[2001.84 --> 2006.98]  And I will not be shaken
[2006.98 --> 2015.36]  And I will build my life upon your love
[2015.36 --> 2019.36]  It is a firm foundation
[2019.36 --> 2025.74]  I will put my trust in you alone
[2025.74 --> 2031.58]  And I will not be shaken
[2031.58 --> 2036.74]  Holy, there is no one like you
[2036.74 --> 2040.02]  There is none beside you
[2040.02 --> 2046.40]  Open up my eyes in wonder and show me
[2046.40 --> 2052.46]  Who you are and fill me with your heart and lead me
[2052.46 --> 2057.40]  Give your love to those around me
[2057.40 --> 2074.86]  Good morning, my name is Mike and I'm a deacon here at this church
[2074.86 --> 2077.88]  And we're going to take a moment in our time of worship
[2077.88 --> 2081.32]  To give back as God has given so much to us
[2081.32 --> 2086.42]  So our offerings today are of course for the ministries and missions of this church
[2086.42 --> 2089.48]  So anything that you would like to give there
[2089.48 --> 2092.06]  You want to designate it or write it as such in your donation
[2092.06 --> 2095.16]  And then anything else that goes in the collection bags
[2095.16 --> 2096.64]  Is for Reframe today
[2096.64 --> 2099.78]  So Reframe Ministries is over 80 years old
[2099.78 --> 2102.20]  It's a ministry of the Christian Reformed Church
[2102.20 --> 2105.04]  And it started as the Back to God Hour
[2105.04 --> 2108.56]  And they actually rebranded as Reframe a number of years ago
[2108.56 --> 2112.22]  Their mission is to see the gospel translated
[2112.22 --> 2115.76]  And brought to as many languages and culture people as possible
[2115.76 --> 2117.76]  So they started as radio
[2117.76 --> 2120.18]  And they've since grown into all kinds of different media
[2120.18 --> 2121.66]  Training resources
[2121.66 --> 2123.90]  And they've grown into quite a powerful ministry
[2123.90 --> 2127.38]  So thank you for giving generously to Reframe today
[2127.38 --> 2146.56]  And many of our 해주 verdure
[2146.56 --> 2147.56]  Amen.
[2176.56 --> 2177.56]  Amen.
[2206.56 --> 2207.56]  Amen.
[2236.56 --> 2237.56]  Amen.
[2266.56 --> 2279.78]  All I have within me, I give you praise.
[2279.78 --> 2287.88]  All that I adore is in you.
[2287.88 --> 2298.88]  Lord, I give you my heart, I give you my soul.
[2298.88 --> 2309.48]  I'll live for you alone, every breath that I take, every moment I'm awake.
[2309.48 --> 2339.46]  Lord, have your way in me.
[2339.48 --> 2369.46]  Lord, have your way in me.
[2369.48 --> 2370.48]  Lord, have your way in me.
[2370.48 --> 2371.48]  Hi.
[2371.48 --> 2372.48]  Hi.
[2372.48 --> 2373.48]  Hey, I have a quick question before we go back there.
[2373.48 --> 2375.48]  Do you guys have nicknames?
[2375.48 --> 2378.48]  Does anybody have a nickname?
[2378.48 --> 2379.48]  Care Bear?
[2379.48 --> 2380.48]  That's cute.
[2380.48 --> 2381.48]  Hales?
[2381.48 --> 2382.48]  Mia?
[2382.48 --> 2385.48]  Do you have a nickname?
[2385.48 --> 2386.48]  Josie?
[2386.48 --> 2388.48]  I think that's your name.
[2388.48 --> 2389.48]  Yeah?
[2389.48 --> 2390.48]  Do you have a nickname?
[2390.48 --> 2391.48]  What's your nickname?
[2391.48 --> 2392.48]  Beanie?
[2392.48 --> 2393.48]  Oh, good one.
[2393.48 --> 2394.48]  Do you have a nickname?
[2394.48 --> 2395.48]  Thinking about it?
[2395.48 --> 2396.48]  What's your nickname?
[2396.48 --> 2397.48]  Eyeball?
[2397.48 --> 2398.48]  I think you maybe made that up.
[2398.48 --> 2399.48]  What's that?
[2399.48 --> 2400.48]  Addie?
[2400.48 --> 2401.48]  Yeah.
[2401.48 --> 2413.48]  Sometimes our nickname is just a short version of our name, but sometimes it's like a different
[2413.48 --> 2414.48]  name.
[2414.48 --> 2417.48]  Do you have a nickname to sometimes your dads or moms or grandparents or your loved ones,
[2417.48 --> 2421.48]  do they even have other names for you guys?
[2421.48 --> 2424.48]  Like your little goofballs?
[2424.48 --> 2425.48]  Or your rascals?
[2425.48 --> 2427.48]  Or your silly guys?
[2427.48 --> 2428.48]  Yeah?
[2428.48 --> 2431.96]  Yeah, some of you are nodding. I know I've used those words before.
[2432.16 --> 2434.76]  We always have lots of names for ourselves, right?
[2434.84 --> 2437.24]  People give us other names. We get nicknames.
[2438.12 --> 2439.50]  We get cute names.
[2439.74 --> 2442.86]  So we're going to talk in Children's Worship Time this month
[2442.86 --> 2447.86]  about all the different names that Jesus has in the Bible
[2447.86 --> 2453.52]  and how some of those names mean a lot for the names we get to have as followers of Jesus.
[2453.90 --> 2454.70]  Yeah, sound good?
[2454.70 --> 2459.88]  So today we're going to talk a big one about Jesus as the Lamb of God.
[2460.66 --> 2465.98]  Okay? Okay, let's stand and bless the adults that are staying back here,
[2466.14 --> 2468.72]  and then we will go and enjoy some time in Children's Worship Time.
[2470.86 --> 2473.04]  The Lord be with you.
[2473.46 --> 2474.98]  And also with you.
[2484.70 --> 2512.10]  It's on. Good.
[2512.10 --> 2513.90]  Happy New Year.
[2514.72 --> 2517.48]  We weren't here last week, so I can say it now.
[2517.86 --> 2520.68]  It's a whole lot easier saying it from up here to everybody.
[2521.44 --> 2522.64]  It's like everybody's covered.
[2526.08 --> 2527.92]  I have a little list here.
[2528.86 --> 2530.36]  My wife is in the nursery.
[2531.04 --> 2532.78]  This is actually her shopping list,
[2532.78 --> 2537.76]  and sometimes it goes missing along with the pen.
[2539.16 --> 2540.14]  Don't tell her.
[2542.00 --> 2545.08]  We want to remember Elise Wagner's father.
[2546.30 --> 2547.76]  We want to remember Tanya.
[2548.98 --> 2550.40]  We want to remember Lena,
[2550.40 --> 2551.94]  and there are others as well,
[2552.08 --> 2555.48]  but we focused on these three ladies for a while.
[2555.48 --> 2561.74]  And then sometimes my sleep is sporadic.
[2563.32 --> 2564.46]  So last night,
[2566.60 --> 2574.00]  what I do when I get the bulletin every Saturday morning
[2574.00 --> 2576.00]  is I look up the scripture.
[2577.14 --> 2577.84]  And that's what I do.
[2577.94 --> 2578.50]  That's what I did.
[2579.08 --> 2582.04]  I also found out yesterday was my turn to pray.
[2582.04 --> 2586.36]  It takes me longer than a day to get out of it.
[2586.88 --> 2588.14]  Anyway, so here I am.
[2590.54 --> 2594.38]  The scripture is Thessalonians 1,
[2595.18 --> 2597.14]  and I want to read verse 4.
[2598.88 --> 2601.52]  For we know, brothers and sisters,
[2601.52 --> 2602.58]  that means everybody,
[2603.98 --> 2605.84]  loved by God.
[2606.08 --> 2606.66]  Imagine that.
[2606.76 --> 2607.70]  Loved by God.
[2608.70 --> 2611.06]  That he has chosen you.
[2612.04 --> 2614.74]  You know, we should just read that over and over and over.
[2614.84 --> 2615.92]  The world is so crazy.
[2616.66 --> 2618.56]  We should just read that over and over.
[2618.98 --> 2619.84]  Anyway, let's pray.
[2621.68 --> 2623.02]  Father, Lord, in heaven, Lord,
[2623.68 --> 2624.32]  thank you.
[2625.12 --> 2626.58]  Thank you that we can come together.
[2626.84 --> 2628.74]  Thank you that we can hear your word.
[2628.92 --> 2630.36]  Thank you that we can read your word.
[2630.90 --> 2632.48]  Thank you that we can share your word.
[2633.54 --> 2636.58]  Help us to do that more and more and more, Lord.
[2636.58 --> 2639.24]  Help us to focus on that daily, weekly.
[2639.24 --> 2641.62]  Help us to get on our knees, Lord.
[2641.88 --> 2642.98]  Nobody needs to know.
[2643.62 --> 2644.38]  Go to your room.
[2644.96 --> 2645.58]  Bow yourself.
[2646.54 --> 2647.12]  And just pray.
[2648.50 --> 2649.76]  Lord, and if we don't know how,
[2649.82 --> 2650.60]  just ask for help.
[2650.80 --> 2651.32]  Lord, help.
[2651.94 --> 2652.54]  And you will.
[2652.74 --> 2653.08]  You do.
[2653.74 --> 2654.34]  Thank you.
[2656.04 --> 2657.42]  Lord, we bring before you
[2657.42 --> 2659.14]  some of our members who
[2659.14 --> 2661.08]  are recovering.
[2662.00 --> 2663.54]  Some of them are in the midst of
[2663.54 --> 2666.74]  stuff being treated
[2666.74 --> 2667.86]  or surgery
[2667.86 --> 2669.10]  or whatever, Lord.
[2669.18 --> 2669.84]  You know everyone.
[2671.02 --> 2672.68]  We prefer everyone that has
[2672.68 --> 2674.48]  issues to deal with
[2674.48 --> 2676.08]  and that from time to time
[2676.08 --> 2676.98]  is most of us, Lord.
[2678.70 --> 2680.38]  Lord, we thank you for this new year.
[2680.82 --> 2682.08]  Lord, there's so much happening
[2682.08 --> 2685.10]  and yet you are always in charge.
[2685.10 --> 2686.56]  You always love us
[2686.56 --> 2688.68]  and you have called
[2688.68 --> 2689.78]  each one of us, Lord.
[2691.80 --> 2693.28]  Lord, as we deal with that
[2693.28 --> 2694.42]  from day to day,
[2694.56 --> 2695.42]  whatever we do,
[2695.72 --> 2696.14]  school,
[2697.06 --> 2697.48]  teaching,
[2698.32 --> 2699.12]  working anywhere,
[2701.02 --> 2701.46]  preaching,
[2702.68 --> 2704.16]  running a congregation, Lord,
[2705.60 --> 2707.00]  Lord, will you lead and guide us?
[2707.00 --> 2710.16]  Will you send us
[2710.16 --> 2713.58]  to people who need your help?
[2713.58 --> 2715.36]  Will you send people to us
[2715.36 --> 2716.64]  when we need help, Lord,
[2717.04 --> 2717.74]  and to share?
[2719.72 --> 2720.88]  Lord, thank you that
[2720.88 --> 2722.26]  we can be called Emmanuel.
[2723.86 --> 2725.34]  Thank you that we can be
[2725.34 --> 2727.22]  servants in your world, Lord.
[2727.92 --> 2729.86]  Give us the strength
[2729.86 --> 2730.60]  and the power
[2730.60 --> 2731.24]  and the wisdom
[2731.24 --> 2732.44]  and the light
[2732.44 --> 2734.84]  to dare to share, Lord.
[2736.28 --> 2737.10]  Lord, we pray
[2737.10 --> 2738.48]  will you be with Kevin this morning
[2738.48 --> 2740.06]  as he shares your word, Lord.
[2740.62 --> 2741.62]  Will you be with each of us
[2741.62 --> 2743.18]  to not only listen
[2743.18 --> 2744.82]  but to go home
[2744.82 --> 2747.80]  and look up that scripture
[2747.80 --> 2748.54]  a little bit more,
[2748.88 --> 2749.86]  study it some more,
[2751.16 --> 2752.20]  and then share
[2752.20 --> 2753.92]  when we have the opportunity, Lord.
[2753.96 --> 2754.68]  It doesn't have to be
[2754.68 --> 2755.26]  a big sermon.
[2755.42 --> 2756.14]  It doesn't have to be
[2756.14 --> 2758.34]  a big spiel or whatever, Lord.
[2758.42 --> 2760.66]  Just that we love you
[2760.66 --> 2761.92]  and that people know that
[2761.92 --> 2762.90]  and see that, Lord.
[2763.04 --> 2764.00]  That's why we're here.
[2764.68 --> 2765.86]  Thank you in Jesus' name.
[2765.96 --> 2766.18]  Amen.
[2773.18 --> 2776.24]  Very, very much.
[2776.24 --> 2776.88]  Thank you.
[2776.88 --> 2777.10]  Thank you.
[2777.10 --> 2795.14]  Several times over the past few years, I've had this cool opportunity to lead a workshop
[2795.14 --> 2799.78]  at various youth conferences entitled Compelling Christianity.
[2800.72 --> 2804.94]  Youth, if you're here still, we've talked about this a bunch over like youth ministry
[2804.94 --> 2807.34]  last couple years, so you can just zone out for like a whole minute.
[2807.46 --> 2809.06]  I'll call you back when I'm ready for you, right?
[2809.18 --> 2813.44]  So Compelling Christianity, it focuses on Romans 3.
[2814.04 --> 2820.16]  And we looked at what separates Christianity from every other religion and worldview out there.
[2820.28 --> 2821.16]  It's a big claim.
[2821.92 --> 2825.36]  But to ruin the whole entire workshop and all of the lead up to it,
[2825.36 --> 2828.84]  what's so compelling about Christianity is that with Jesus,
[2828.84 --> 2835.04]  your salvation is not dependent on you or your works.
[2835.80 --> 2842.02]  Your salvation, your pathway to forgiveness, mercy, and eternal life is, was, and always has been
[2842.02 --> 2845.32]  dependent on Jesus and what he did.
[2845.88 --> 2846.96]  Not you, but him.
[2847.16 --> 2853.04]  In every other religion, in every other worldview, the belief is that your morals, your accomplishments,
[2853.04 --> 2860.06]  your spiritual records, what you do affects the outcome, affects your present and your future.
[2860.24 --> 2864.28]  If your performance, your actions, or your accomplishments are good enough,
[2864.62 --> 2869.54]  you go to heaven, or you go to a place called jhana, or you attain nirvana or enlightenment,
[2870.04 --> 2872.38]  or you become a sovereign over a planet,
[2872.74 --> 2877.08]  or you end up creating a positive legacy for yourself and then simply cease to be.
[2878.28 --> 2880.54]  Now, I'm summing up a whole workshop here in a paragraph,
[2880.54 --> 2882.68]  so this is a little bit oversimplified, but it's true.
[2883.04 --> 2889.38]  Everywhere else, your eternity, your salvation, or whatever you call it, however you dress it up,
[2889.70 --> 2891.38]  depends on you.
[2892.80 --> 2897.16]  However, with Christianity, with Jesus, God intervenes.
[2897.76 --> 2899.04]  Jesus came to us.
[2899.64 --> 2902.66]  Righteousness is given apart from what we do.
[2902.96 --> 2904.28]  No other place offers this.
[2904.64 --> 2909.14]  Outside of the gospel, we must deliver our own righteousness to earn our way to glory.
[2909.14 --> 2910.88]  But Christ's gospel is different.
[2910.88 --> 2916.30]  It says that we have developed a perfect righteousness, or God, sorry, has developed a perfect righteousness,
[2916.52 --> 2917.68]  and he offers it to you.
[2918.54 --> 2921.94]  And by what Christ did, we are accepted.
[2922.74 --> 2924.98]  That's the uniqueness of the Christian gospel.
[2925.06 --> 2929.10]  Now, we preach this all the time here because this is the gospel truth found in Jesus.
[2929.10 --> 2933.74]  Now, what's cool is when I do this workshop with youth, most people listen,
[2933.94 --> 2936.10]  and there's generally pretty good engagement, which is nice,
[2936.16 --> 2939.92]  but then as it ends, most youth sort of filter out the back, and that's totally fine and normal.
[2940.10 --> 2945.06]  But every time I've done it, at least one, and oftentimes several youths come up to me afterwards,
[2945.56 --> 2947.30]  very intrigued, very excited.
[2947.66 --> 2950.64]  They've said that they've never heard this before or presented in this way,
[2950.64 --> 2955.02]  and they become just a little bit more interested in what this gospel of Jesus is saying.
[2956.62 --> 2958.28]  Because this is compelling.
[2959.82 --> 2961.20]  It's not up to you.
[2961.40 --> 2962.28]  It's because of him.
[2963.54 --> 2964.38]  All right, youth, now time over.
[2964.46 --> 2965.02]  You can come back now.
[2966.92 --> 2972.94]  Now, this very compelling truth does open up a curious question, though.
[2972.94 --> 2980.02]  If our salvation is not dependent on us, if we don't have to do anything to earn salvation,
[2980.16 --> 2984.38]  if salvation is completely and utterly because of what Christ accomplished,
[2985.38 --> 2989.92]  if salvation is all grace, why bother doing anything?
[2991.84 --> 2994.68]  See, if we don't have to do anything for our salvation,
[2995.40 --> 2998.02]  and we could just repent of our sin and be saved,
[2998.02 --> 3003.14]  why not just do whatever we want and then give it to Jesus later?
[3004.62 --> 3008.70]  See, in reformed circles, I've heard this called covenant child syndrome.
[3009.92 --> 3012.08]  In other circles, I've heard it called cheap grace.
[3013.08 --> 3018.16]  But this sort of misplaced and unethical idea is that if we're saved by faith in Jesus,
[3018.74 --> 3022.12]  and it's not by our own works, and he forgives you anyways,
[3023.32 --> 3026.66]  just do whatever you want, have faith, and repent on your deathbed.
[3026.66 --> 3030.12]  You get no rules, no requirements, all the glory, eternal life.
[3030.20 --> 3031.12]  Boom, loophole.
[3032.60 --> 3033.50]  It's a win-win.
[3035.88 --> 3039.42]  Well, as we continue our sermon series today on the letters to the church in Thessalonica,
[3039.78 --> 3045.08]  we'll see that this text that we're about to read dispels the idea of cheap grace
[3045.08 --> 3046.64]  or covenant child syndrome.
[3047.42 --> 3050.86]  Paul celebrates the faith of this church in Thessalonica
[3050.86 --> 3054.02]  and praises them for a faith that works.
[3054.86 --> 3056.42]  They have a faith that works.
[3056.66 --> 3058.20]  So we're going to dig into that today.
[3058.44 --> 3062.80]  We'll be reading 1 Thessalonians 1, verses 2 to 10 together.
[3062.92 --> 3065.18]  And as always, I invite you to have your Bibles open.
[3065.26 --> 3066.44]  There's some in the back if you need.
[3066.68 --> 3068.80]  You can even have your Bible apps on your phone open.
[3068.86 --> 3072.06]  That's great, because we're going to be referencing this passage over and over again today.
[3073.36 --> 3077.24]  But 1 Thessalonians 1, verses 2 to 10 says this.
[3077.24 --> 3107.24] 
[3107.24 --> 3115.66]  You know how we lived among you for your sake.
[3115.66 --> 3122.60]  You became imitators of us and of the Lord, for you welcomed the message in the midst of severe suffering
[3122.60 --> 3126.50]  with the joy given by the Holy Spirit.
[3126.50 --> 3132.04]  And so you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.
[3132.04 --> 3137.42]  The Lord's message rang out from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia.
[3137.50 --> 3140.38]  Your faith in God has become known everywhere.
[3141.54 --> 3143.76]  Therefore, we do not need to say anything about it,
[3143.80 --> 3147.34]  for they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us.
[3147.34 --> 3154.04]  They tell how you turn to God from idols to serve the living and true God
[3154.04 --> 3157.58]  and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead,
[3157.98 --> 3160.90]  Jesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath.
[3161.92 --> 3162.96]  The word of the Lord.
[3164.60 --> 3167.26]  It's fun preaching a very positive text, isn't it?
[3167.28 --> 3169.42]  This is a very positive text.
[3171.20 --> 3174.16]  And the heart of this text is what we talked about off the beginning.
[3174.16 --> 3178.92]  The big idea today is that transforming faith is a faith that works.
[3180.24 --> 3182.80]  Transforming faith is faith that works.
[3183.70 --> 3186.82]  See, Paul and Timothy and Silas, in our text today,
[3186.92 --> 3192.16]  they unabashedly celebrate this church in Thessalonica for their faith that is working.
[3193.32 --> 3197.52]  And when I say working, I mean like physically and visibly working.
[3197.64 --> 3201.64]  A faith that does, not just simply is.
[3201.64 --> 3204.56]  Look at the first two verses of our text.
[3204.70 --> 3210.96]  See how Paul, Timothy, and Silas just praise this church for their actionable faith.
[3211.88 --> 3216.40]  But do notice, they aren't simply boasting.
[3217.14 --> 3218.88]  They're boasting in the Lord.
[3219.78 --> 3221.94]  They always thank God for them.
[3222.00 --> 3224.74]  They remember them before God and before their Father.
[3224.86 --> 3227.56]  They praise their faith, their labor of love, and their endurance.
[3227.56 --> 3233.14]  But not just their endurance, but their endurance that they have because of their hope in Jesus Christ.
[3234.62 --> 3242.76]  They praise God for their brothers and sisters who are worthy of encouraging because of their praise and dedication to God.
[3243.72 --> 3244.82]  See, it's God first.
[3246.04 --> 3253.06]  And then what flows from God is this spirit-driven work done by this church in Thessalonica because of their faith.
[3253.06 --> 3257.04]  Paul then goes on to describe this working faith.
[3257.68 --> 3261.36]  In verses 4 and 5, it speaks about how God has chosen them.
[3261.64 --> 3263.02]  Dick just highlighted this.
[3263.40 --> 3263.76]  He says,
[3264.12 --> 3268.50]  For we know, brothers and sisters, loved by God, that he has chosen you.
[3269.10 --> 3273.34]  Because our gospel came to you, not simply with words, but also with power.
[3273.74 --> 3275.60]  With the Holy Spirit and a deep conviction.
[3277.44 --> 3279.04]  See, God had chosen them.
[3279.04 --> 3282.56]  And the gospel came to them with power from the Spirit.
[3282.80 --> 3284.78]  Again, this is God's directive.
[3286.18 --> 3286.28]  Right?
[3286.36 --> 3290.60]  The fact that God chose them reminds us, it doubles down on the truth,
[3291.00 --> 3295.54]  that salvation is not something that's earned by human effort, not earned by what you do.
[3296.50 --> 3299.86]  Instead, it's rooted in God's loving grace.
[3300.72 --> 3307.24]  This church in Thessalonica was not chosen by God, though, because they worked on their faith.
[3307.24 --> 3315.08]  Rather, this church in Thessalonica, because they were chosen, they had a faith that worked.
[3317.02 --> 3319.84]  See, God's choosing precedes faith.
[3319.94 --> 3324.54]  And faith, in turn, produces visible results in the lives of these believers.
[3325.78 --> 3326.92]  Faith is transformative.
[3328.08 --> 3332.26]  And true faith is evidenced by a life that works in response to this grace.
[3332.26 --> 3337.54]  Beyond that, our faith comes from the power of the Holy Spirit.
[3337.62 --> 3344.22]  According to verse 5 of our text, the Thessalonians' faith, it came through a deep conviction in the work of the Holy Spirit in their hearts.
[3344.94 --> 3349.80]  Now, if you remember last week, Pastor Chris talked about this church's context and where they were situated.
[3350.16 --> 3354.84]  They didn't rationally follow Jesus because it was convenient for them.
[3355.26 --> 3358.04]  This wasn't like a step up for them socially.
[3358.04 --> 3362.14]  In fact, they weren't getting any advantages at all by following Christ.
[3362.40 --> 3367.44]  Choosing to follow Christ subjected them to all sorts of persecution and suffering.
[3367.84 --> 3372.68]  It would have affected them personally, financially, socially, economically, and culturally.
[3374.46 --> 3383.24]  And yet, Paul notes in verse 6 that they welcomed the truth of the gospel in the midst of severe suffering.
[3383.24 --> 3389.84]  Their faith was not merely of belief or some sort of surface level commitment.
[3390.92 --> 3396.44]  It was a spirit-empowered conviction that led them to transformation.
[3398.84 --> 3402.00]  This faith in Jesus produces tangible and visible results.
[3402.08 --> 3403.32]  We see this elsewhere in Scripture, too.
[3403.40 --> 3405.80]  This isn't just found in this text here.
[3405.86 --> 3410.76]  The book of James is famous for saying that the faith without works is dead.
[3410.76 --> 3413.64]  Similarly, Ephesians 2 verse 10 says this.
[3414.16 --> 3418.20]  It says that we are God's workmanship created in Jesus Christ for good works.
[3418.60 --> 3422.92]  Which, and hear this, God prepared in advance for us to do.
[3424.68 --> 3426.92]  When God saves us, we have work to do.
[3427.54 --> 3430.34]  Not to stay saved, but because we are saved.
[3432.42 --> 3434.62]  See, faith is rooted in Jesus Christ.
[3435.46 --> 3436.50]  It's not hidden.
[3437.20 --> 3438.62]  It's not simply belief.
[3438.70 --> 3439.88]  It cannot be inactive.
[3439.88 --> 3442.68]  It manifests in our daily life.
[3442.98 --> 3444.30]  And it shapes the way we live.
[3444.52 --> 3444.92]  In everything.
[3445.06 --> 3446.12]  It shapes the way we talk.
[3446.38 --> 3448.50]  It shapes the way we gather together as community.
[3448.82 --> 3450.40]  It shapes the way we spend our money.
[3450.78 --> 3452.84]  It shapes the way we work in our communities.
[3453.20 --> 3453.64]  Everything.
[3455.12 --> 3459.40]  That is the transformative power of faith in the gospel truth of Jesus Christ.
[3460.00 --> 3464.02]  And that's what this church in Thessalonica is being praised for.
[3464.20 --> 3465.70]  They had a faith that works.
[3465.70 --> 3469.80]  And so it raises a good question for us.
[3469.80 --> 3482.30]  If someone were to follow me around for a week, would there be enough evidence in my life, in the way that I handle my day-to-day living, for them to accuse me of being a Christian?
[3482.30 --> 3493.96]  If someone were to follow you around for a week, would there be enough evidence in the ways that you handle your day-to-day living, for them to accuse you of being a Christian?
[3495.44 --> 3498.80]  Would our lives clearly show who we follow?
[3498.80 --> 3498.82]  Would our lives clearly show who we follow?
[3498.82 --> 3528.80]  Would our lives clearly show who we follow?
[3528.82 --> 3531.46]  With one another because of their hope in Jesus Christ.
[3534.32 --> 3547.52]  One of the reasons we are doing this sermon series throughout the books, these two books of Thessalonians, is that both Pastor Chris and I see, and what we pray is that many of you will see as well, that God is doing some very cool things here at Emmanuel.
[3547.52 --> 3553.98]  Now, obviously, the context is different, and the joys and the sorrows experienced by these two churches don't directly correlate.
[3553.98 --> 3559.10]  But what God is doing in our midst seems to have some similarities with this Thessalonian church.
[3560.20 --> 3565.80]  When Pastor Chris and I were discussing that this week in our office, Pastor Chris brought up the image of an overhead projector.
[3565.90 --> 3567.74]  Remember those with the transparency sheets?
[3568.18 --> 3574.12]  And he was like, if you put, like, a transparency sheet of our church and a transparency sheet of the Thessalonian church, you could see some similarities.
[3574.12 --> 3579.40]  I'm not going to use that example because Chris is a dinosaur, and I don't think anybody actually knows what he's talking about.
[3579.78 --> 3589.26]  But if we wanted to modern it up a little bit, if we utilized advanced document comparison algorithms or leveraged image editing software with overlay functionalities,
[3589.26 --> 3594.66]  whether you displayed that on a smart board or by the precision layering tools of a graphic tablet,
[3594.90 --> 3603.18]  you could systematically analyze the similarities that see that our church does, in fact, reflect the church described in our text today.
[3603.48 --> 3605.38]  Overhead projectors, Chris, seriously.
[3607.94 --> 3612.46]  What we're getting at is that there are parallels here.
[3613.60 --> 3615.44]  And as Josh would say, we think that's awesome.
[3616.94 --> 3618.10]  Look at verse 3 again.
[3618.10 --> 3622.64]  The Thessalonian church was commended because their works were produced by faith.
[3623.92 --> 3630.76]  When I look here and I see the discipleship ministries whose work produces faith in the lives of our congregation, it's here as well.
[3631.30 --> 3636.84]  Ministries like cadets and gems and coffee break and story hour and children's worship time.
[3637.02 --> 3639.04]  And it's not just the ministries of this church.
[3639.28 --> 3643.06]  There are teams of people here doing hard work behind the scenes,
[3643.06 --> 3647.66]  making sure that we are able to gather together and grow in faith with one another.
[3648.10 --> 3652.70]  Teams like the kitchen team and board of stewards, sound of media, sound and media, sorry,
[3652.70 --> 3659.34]  counting committee, communion prep here today, liturgical arts, worship ministry, all of these groups,
[3660.06 --> 3665.50]  and many more do such good work, which allows us to gather and grow in faith together.
[3665.50 --> 3671.50]  Now, this Thessalonian church was acclaimed because their labor was also prompted by love.
[3671.58 --> 3680.64]  And again, I look around this congregation and I see so many people in ministries laboring in love for the community around us.
[3680.64 --> 3688.16]  People are involved in night shift, at Gateway of Hope, organizing and participating in missions trips.
[3688.58 --> 3690.60]  They're serving breakfast at HD Stafford.
[3690.86 --> 3695.88]  There's the work of the refugee team and various local service opportunities like hamper ministry,
[3696.40 --> 3700.32]  food drives, meal trains, kettle campaigners, school supply deliveries,
[3700.86 --> 3703.16]  and of course, the work of the deacons and many other people.
[3703.16 --> 3713.06]  And finally, this Thessalonian church is encouraged because they endured with one another due to their hope in Jesus Christ.
[3713.16 --> 3715.82]  And again, there's so much compassion care happening in this church.
[3717.12 --> 3721.90]  You see it in mentorship ministries and pastoral care work and women's and men's ministry,
[3722.08 --> 3725.04]  seniors ministry, prayer ministry, the work of our elders,
[3725.58 --> 3730.78]  and then the unseen cards and prayers and visiting from those in our community here,
[3730.78 --> 3735.38]  which does not always get recognized because it's happening in the background all the time.
[3735.92 --> 3738.94]  That is what faith that works looks like.
[3740.44 --> 3741.58]  Praise God for that.
[3744.16 --> 3752.90]  Commentator Mark Howell notes that the transforming work of Christ decisively and completely reoriented the lives of the Thessalonians.
[3753.38 --> 3757.36]  So apparent was their break from past pursuits that others took notice of their transformation.
[3758.40 --> 3760.52]  Others took notice of them.
[3760.78 --> 3765.78]  One of the reasons I listed all those ministries is not to brag necessarily,
[3766.24 --> 3772.76]  but it's to highlight something that Chris and I do all the time.
[3772.86 --> 3775.96]  We boast in the Lord about this place, about this church, about you.
[3776.50 --> 3779.96]  The work and the time and the effort that goes on by so many of you.
[3780.70 --> 3781.84]  We notice you.
[3782.00 --> 3782.88]  We thank you.
[3783.50 --> 3784.54]  Thank you for your work.
[3784.54 --> 3788.46]  Thank you for being faithful to God in that way
[3788.46 --> 3790.52]  and for being a part of this community.
[3791.52 --> 3795.66]  And maybe some of you are new here or considering different ways of what that could look like for you.
[3795.72 --> 3797.94]  We'd love to have you involved in any of these ways.
[3798.32 --> 3800.54]  God is doing some amazing things here.
[3800.82 --> 3801.86]  Come be a part of that.
[3802.78 --> 3804.22]  And church, celebrate this.
[3806.16 --> 3808.28]  God is doing his good work through you.
[3808.92 --> 3809.72]  Praise God.
[3809.72 --> 3810.72]  God is doing some amazing things here.
[3810.72 --> 3811.72]  We're not done.
[3811.72 --> 3813.00]  We're not done.
[3814.00 --> 3819.06]  See, our text here concludes with two verses that provide an example to follow
[3819.06 --> 3822.62]  and help us prepare for what lies ahead in the rest of this letter
[3822.62 --> 3824.88]  that we're going to be looking at for the next little while.
[3825.14 --> 3827.46]  Look at verse 9 here right now.
[3828.24 --> 3829.06]  Verse 9 says this.
[3829.12 --> 3829.36]  It says,
[3829.36 --> 3841.24]  This church turned to God.
[3842.08 --> 3844.06]  They repented and they served.
[3846.56 --> 3847.96]  That was their faith in action.
[3848.08 --> 3850.02]  That was their transformative formula.
[3850.44 --> 3851.58]  Their faith that works.
[3851.94 --> 3852.84]  They turned to God.
[3853.14 --> 3854.78]  They repented and they served.
[3855.80 --> 3858.60]  And again, this should be our rhythm of faith as well.
[3858.60 --> 3861.40]  We should be turning to God first.
[3862.36 --> 3865.40]  Now for those of you out there who call Jesus as your Lord and Savior,
[3865.52 --> 3867.06]  this is something that we do regularly.
[3867.56 --> 3870.26]  And we can do this because he's already got us.
[3871.26 --> 3872.84]  We belong to him.
[3873.76 --> 3874.84]  He is not distant.
[3875.14 --> 3875.92]  He is near.
[3876.00 --> 3877.78]  He might seem far away at times.
[3877.96 --> 3880.38]  And things might certainly be hard for us here and there.
[3880.58 --> 3882.16]  We can certainly find trouble.
[3882.16 --> 3888.16]  But we can always turn to God because we belong to him.
[3888.60 --> 3890.82]  And we can trust that he is with us always.
[3892.60 --> 3897.38]  No matter what we go through, there is this comfort of knowing that God is with us.
[3897.40 --> 3900.10]  And that brings a peace that can pass our understanding.
[3900.10 --> 3908.48]  And for those of us here today that might not know him yet, this is a call to faith in this text.
[3909.56 --> 3912.58]  A challenge for us to press in a little.
[3913.64 --> 3917.08]  An invitation to be brought into this text, actually.
[3917.50 --> 3921.54]  This is a letter written to a specific church who confessed that Jesus is Lord.
[3921.54 --> 3925.98]  And this here, Emmanuel CRC, is also a church who's confessing the same thing.
[3926.62 --> 3929.12]  But it is possible maybe you haven't made this confession yet.
[3930.18 --> 3934.86]  But if you're compelled by the grace offered to you by the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.
[3934.92 --> 3939.62]  If you're curious about this working faith that we're talking about.
[3939.76 --> 3946.38]  About how you're not saved by your actions, but your lives are transformed because of the gospel truth of Jesus Christ.
[3946.38 --> 3951.18]  If you're wondering how Jesus lived the life that we've been called to live but fail.
[3951.46 --> 3954.72]  And that Jesus then died a death that I deserve, that you deserve.
[3954.86 --> 3957.36]  Only to raise up from the dead three days later.
[3957.60 --> 3959.28]  Defeating sin and death forever.
[3959.36 --> 3960.80]  If you're curious about that.
[3961.66 --> 3963.38]  If that intrigues you just a little.
[3963.56 --> 3964.82]  Press in.
[3965.86 --> 3967.00]  Invite him in.
[3967.08 --> 3969.54]  Be a part of this text today.
[3969.68 --> 3971.32]  This church today.
[3971.42 --> 3972.08]  This body.
[3972.08 --> 3974.98]  And by this body I don't mean Emmanuel CRC.
[3975.08 --> 3977.02]  Although please do come back and be a part of this.
[3977.56 --> 3979.00]  I mean Christ's church.
[3979.80 --> 3983.44]  The one whom he lived and died and rose again for.
[3983.50 --> 3987.32]  The one whom he redeemed and saved and rules over.
[3987.74 --> 3994.92]  Now the church who has been empowered by the Holy Spirit to transform the lives of billions of people throughout history.
[3996.32 --> 3997.16]  Press in.
[3997.82 --> 3998.66]  Come learn more.
[3998.66 --> 4003.74]  We are called to turn to God.
[4005.18 --> 4007.02]  And then notice we're called to repent.
[4008.78 --> 4012.00]  Turn away from idols or the things that so easily entangle us.
[4012.34 --> 4013.26]  Idols are tricky though.
[4013.58 --> 4015.30]  Idols are tricky because they can be anything.
[4016.62 --> 4017.26]  They can be anything.
[4017.36 --> 4019.22]  They can be things we know that are pinning us down.
[4019.42 --> 4020.66]  Things that we're very aware of.
[4020.92 --> 4025.10]  Things like vices or addictions or things that draw us away from God and community.
[4025.10 --> 4029.90]  But they can also be good things actually.
[4030.06 --> 4034.32]  Good things that have taken root in our hearts and have become maybe ultimate things.
[4034.96 --> 4037.12]  Things that we've elevated in place of God.
[4037.20 --> 4040.68]  Things that we actually worship more than God himself.
[4041.54 --> 4045.62]  Things like work or play or even people like family and friends.
[4046.30 --> 4049.44]  See idols are the things that we place above our God.
[4049.44 --> 4051.16]  And they entrap us.
[4051.24 --> 4051.98]  Sometimes quickly.
[4052.14 --> 4052.88]  Sometimes slowly.
[4053.10 --> 4054.18]  But they take our time.
[4054.28 --> 4055.06]  They take our energy.
[4055.18 --> 4056.52]  They take ourselves.
[4057.86 --> 4060.04]  And we allow them to run our lives.
[4061.34 --> 4064.04]  And I think often times we don't even realize it.
[4065.74 --> 4069.54]  The Thessalonians, they were admired for turning away from those idols.
[4071.54 --> 4074.36]  Turning away from those things of the world that were entangling them.
[4074.36 --> 4076.00]  And then turning to God.
[4077.28 --> 4079.80]  And so for us, what's at the forefront of our minds?
[4079.92 --> 4080.84]  Is it our savior?
[4080.98 --> 4084.26]  Is it his work in our life or in the lives of the community around it?
[4084.64 --> 4088.08]  Is it stewarding his gifts well here on earth?
[4088.84 --> 4090.18]  Or is it something else?
[4091.40 --> 4094.38]  I think this is a question we can ask every single day.
[4094.68 --> 4096.22]  What are our idols?
[4096.38 --> 4097.98]  What are we turning to today?
[4098.52 --> 4100.62]  Is it God or is it something else?
[4100.62 --> 4106.00]  Finally, the Thessalonians.
[4106.22 --> 4109.20]  This is going to be a problem throughout this whole sermon series, I think.
[4109.76 --> 4111.56]  The Thessalonians served.
[4112.50 --> 4113.82]  And we've talked about this.
[4115.26 --> 4116.36]  The Thessalonians served.
[4116.60 --> 4118.52]  They had a faith that worked.
[4119.06 --> 4120.34]  They labored in love.
[4120.64 --> 4123.32]  They endured because of the hope that they found in Jesus.
[4124.36 --> 4127.06]  Emmanuel CRC, may we do the same.
[4127.06 --> 4139.58]  Finally, our text concludes in verse 10, where Paul highlights how that hope that we seek is found in the eventual return of our King Jesus Christ.
[4140.62 --> 4144.62]  Now, this actually becomes a bit of a theme that we see throughout the entire letter.
[4144.70 --> 4146.18]  Both letters, actually, of Thessalonians.
[4146.18 --> 4154.00]  Paul challenges this church to view their present circumstances through the lens of God's eternal promises.
[4154.00 --> 4159.96]  See, the letters of 1 and 2 Thessalonians focus heavily on eschatology.
[4160.08 --> 4162.08]  That's the study of the end times.
[4162.44 --> 4164.82]  Especially, of course, on the final coming of Christ.
[4165.98 --> 4171.32]  Notice, though, Paul doesn't aim to answer when Christ will return.
[4172.32 --> 4176.48]  But he emphasizes the certainty that it will happen.
[4176.66 --> 4178.26]  That Christ will come again.
[4178.44 --> 4179.68]  That distinction is crucial.
[4179.68 --> 4184.64]  See, the promise of Jesus' return is not a matter of, like, human calculations.
[4185.24 --> 4191.78]  But for us, this promise is a divine certainty that actually shapes how we should live today.
[4193.76 --> 4200.86]  Do you remember back in 2012, after, like, 5,000 years of history, the Mayan calendar was coming to an end?
[4201.10 --> 4201.64]  You remember that?
[4202.16 --> 4203.92]  December 21st, 2012.
[4204.62 --> 4207.68]  It actually became known as the 2012 phenomenon.
[4207.68 --> 4210.88]  So many people thought the world was going to come to an end there.
[4210.96 --> 4213.16]  I'm sure you heard about it back then, if you were around.
[4214.00 --> 4214.84]  But it was everywhere.
[4214.94 --> 4215.64]  It was a big deal.
[4216.18 --> 4219.14]  Like, people had circled the date on their calendars.
[4219.24 --> 4221.00]  People quit their jobs beforehand.
[4221.24 --> 4223.34]  They gathered in parks at night the night before.
[4224.52 --> 4225.18]  It's crazy.
[4225.60 --> 4228.12]  The world was definitely ending December 12th.
[4228.14 --> 4229.74]  Or, sorry, yeah, December 21, 2012.
[4231.42 --> 4232.96]  My favorite part was the next day.
[4232.96 --> 4236.56]  You know, the day after the world didn't end?
[4237.10 --> 4240.90]  Actually, there's a billboard that popped up in a town somewhere in the States.
[4241.76 --> 4242.82]  It was awesome.
[4245.78 --> 4249.38]  But about that day or hour when Jesus returns, no one knows.
[4249.50 --> 4253.34]  Not even the angels in heaven nor the sun, but only the Father.
[4253.34 --> 4260.10]  We get trapped sometimes trying to figure out when Christ will come again.
[4260.70 --> 4262.34]  Or even how it will go down.
[4263.54 --> 4267.12]  But Paul's not worried about how this will happen or when this will happen.
[4268.22 --> 4271.80]  He's just reminding people here that it will happen.
[4271.80 --> 4277.56]  We don't need to concern ourselves of when or if or how long it will take for Jesus to turn.
[4277.60 --> 4284.34]  But we can sure rest in the hope and knowledge that Christ will come again.
[4286.54 --> 4290.44]  And for Paul, this wasn't just some, like, theological idea.
[4291.54 --> 4298.06]  But it actually was this practical way of life that shaped how the Thessalonian church engaged with their present challenges.
[4298.06 --> 4304.80]  It is in this truth that Paul directs all of us, actually.
[4304.92 --> 4307.22]  The Thessalonians and the Emmanuelites.
[4308.02 --> 4309.62]  Paul urges us all to look up.
[4310.38 --> 4311.56]  I mean, figuratively look up.
[4311.58 --> 4314.32]  But we could look up with anticipation for our king.
[4315.68 --> 4318.86]  See, this gaze, this upward gaze is not, it's not passive waiting.
[4319.12 --> 4320.36]  It's not just an ideology.
[4320.60 --> 4322.14]  It's an active faith.
[4322.14 --> 4328.70]  It reflects a life lived in anticipation for Christ's reign and the fulfillment of all of God's promises.
[4329.60 --> 4339.80]  So when chaos or uncertainty surrounds us, our response should not be one of looking around in fear or confusion.
[4340.58 --> 4346.94]  But we can plant ourselves and look upward in confident hope.
[4346.94 --> 4353.62]  And this perspective shift is not simply about us enduring difficult times together,
[4353.72 --> 4359.20]  but it's about us reorienting our lives around the promise of Christ's return.
[4361.08 --> 4371.48]  See, faith in Jesus and hope in his kingdom come gives us a foundation that allows us to face present challenges with resilience and with purpose.
[4371.48 --> 4380.60]  But more than that, it's a reminder that the story of our lives is part of a much greater narrative.
[4382.54 --> 4385.82]  One where God's promises always are fulfilled.
[4386.52 --> 4394.72]  And as we wait, and as we look up with anticipation, we're called to live with the faith that works.
[4394.72 --> 4410.04]  This letter is going to get to what that looks like and how that faith and works plays itself out.
[4410.60 --> 4419.62]  But this faith, which is exemplified by this church, gives us hope because it comes from, is sustained by,
[4419.62 --> 4423.96]  and is fixed upon the giver of eternal life, Jesus Christ.
[4425.02 --> 4431.54]  This eternal hope reorients our perspectives here and now, as well as tomorrow and beyond.
[4431.72 --> 4431.90]  Amen?
[4433.14 --> 4437.62]  I'm going to pray, and then following the prayer, Pastor Chris is going to come forward and lead us in the Lord's Supper,
[4437.70 --> 4445.40]  which not only reorients our lives, but it grounds us in that reality that Jesus came to save us all from the clutches of sin and death,
[4445.52 --> 4448.78]  and will come again to usher in us into eternal glory.
[4449.36 --> 4449.90]  So let's pray.
[4449.90 --> 4458.10]  Our Father in heaven, God, we praise you for this church in Thessalonica, for this letter to these people, Lord.
[4458.30 --> 4464.90]  We praise you for this church as well, for the work that you are doing in and amongst the members here at Emanuel CRC, God.
[4465.12 --> 4471.54]  And as we partake in Lord's Supper in a moment, as we go out into our third places today,
[4471.54 --> 4475.34]  may we live this life with faith that works.
[4475.84 --> 4479.74]  God, may others in our life notice who it is we serve and follow.
[4480.14 --> 4487.60]  May we work in our communities, in the way we talk, in the way we work, in the way we spend our money,
[4487.68 --> 4492.50]  in the way we gather with one another, in the fun we have, in the joys we have, in the sorrows we experience.
[4492.50 --> 4494.16]  May all of it be to your glory.
[4496.70 --> 4502.42]  And so God, may that truth infuse itself into our hearts and lives.
[4503.94 --> 4506.18]  Be with us now as we celebrate this supper.
[4506.82 --> 4508.42]  We pray this in your name. Amen.
[4522.50 --> 4527.98]  My name is Chris, and apparently I'm a dinosaur in this church.
[4530.26 --> 4537.90]  We are going to come to the table, and as Kevin has just so beautifully said for us,
[4538.38 --> 4546.00]  this supper is a means of connecting us not only to God in Jesus Christ as we receive him here,
[4546.22 --> 4551.88]  but connecting us to each other as the body of Christ as we together take that in.
[4552.50 --> 4559.72]  And so we show that in a couple ways here at Emanuel, not least of which is the liturgy we use,
[4559.78 --> 4560.94]  the words that we use.
[4561.62 --> 4566.84]  And some of the words that I'm going to invite you to speak and participate as we come to this table
[4566.84 --> 4570.84]  are almost 2,000 years old.
[4571.62 --> 4575.92]  And so not only are we connecting ourselves to the body of Christ here at Langley Emanuel,
[4575.92 --> 4581.82]  but we are connecting ourselves to the Christian church throughout time and space.
[4582.50 --> 4585.00]  As those who belong to Jesus.
[4586.00 --> 4592.48]  Jesus is really present here at this table, and we receive him as his body.
[4593.10 --> 4597.92]  And so as we move through this liturgy, I invite you to speak words that appear on the screen
[4597.92 --> 4603.16]  that are indicated for you as a way of connecting to him, connecting to each other,
[4603.16 --> 4606.48]  and connecting to the church throughout time and space.
[4607.14 --> 4609.96]  And so congregation of Jesus Christ, lift up your hearts.
[4610.80 --> 4612.36]  Give them up to the Lord.
[4612.70 --> 4614.86]  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
[4615.42 --> 4617.60]  It is right for us to give thanks.
[4617.84 --> 4618.80]  Let us pray together.
[4618.80 --> 4623.62]  With joy, we praise you, gracious God.
[4624.34 --> 4626.46]  For you have created heaven and earth.
[4627.36 --> 4633.40]  You have made us in your image and kept covenant with us, even when we fell into sin.
[4634.14 --> 4640.68]  We give you thanks for Jesus Christ, who by his life, death, and resurrection opened for us
[4640.68 --> 4643.54]  the way of everlasting life.
[4643.54 --> 4645.50]  In his name we pray.
[4646.30 --> 4646.64]  Amen.
[4650.26 --> 4652.00]  Congregation of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[4652.52 --> 4660.00]  Our Lord Jesus, before he suffered, gave us this memorial of his sacrifice until he comes again.
[4660.96 --> 4664.46]  And the Lord Jesus, on the night that he was betrayed, took bread.
[4664.46 --> 4668.20]  And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[4668.56 --> 4671.30]  This is my body, which is for you.
[4672.12 --> 4674.92]  Do this in remembrance of me.
[4675.70 --> 4679.10]  And in the same way, he took the cup after supper,
[4680.02 --> 4683.68]  saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[4684.82 --> 4689.28]  Do this whenever you drink it in remembrance of me.
[4689.28 --> 4694.16]  For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup,
[4694.36 --> 4698.98]  you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.
[4700.08 --> 4703.90]  This is the mystery of our faith.
[4705.36 --> 4707.70]  Your death, O Christ, we proclaim.
[4708.42 --> 4710.96]  Your resurrection we affirm with joy.
[4711.64 --> 4713.84]  And your coming we await with hope.
[4714.64 --> 4716.68]  Glory be to you, Lord Jesus.
[4716.68 --> 4716.84]  Jesus.
[4718.84 --> 4723.58]  Church family, the Lord has prepared his table for all who love him,
[4723.66 --> 4726.84]  for all who trust in him alone for their salvation.
[4727.72 --> 4731.48]  And so, come to this table, you who have much faith.
[4731.86 --> 4734.28]  Come to this table, you who would like to have more.
[4735.18 --> 4738.28]  Come to this table, you who have been to the sacrament often,
[4738.54 --> 4740.88]  and you who have not been for a long time.
[4741.20 --> 4744.08]  Come to this table, you who have tried to follow Jesus,
[4744.08 --> 4747.42]  and come to this table, you who have failed.
[4747.42 --> 4751.92]  Come to this table, because Jesus Christ is raised.
[4753.06 --> 4754.48]  Come to this table.
[4754.64 --> 4756.26]  If you are here with us this morning,
[4756.48 --> 4758.72]  or if you are joining us at home,
[4758.76 --> 4761.44]  and you are part of this body together,
[4761.64 --> 4766.40]  come to this table, because it is Christ who welcomes us here.
[4766.40 --> 4772.70]  These are indeed the gifts of God for the people of God.
[4774.66 --> 4776.90]  As I mentioned, as we come to this table,
[4777.06 --> 4778.86]  we will do so in groups.
[4779.12 --> 4783.14]  We will have elders who will indicate when it's time for you to come to the front.
[4783.42 --> 4785.86]  We'll gather in a circle in one group,
[4785.92 --> 4789.30]  and then you will be past the bread or the juice.
[4789.48 --> 4792.14]  As you pass the bread to the person beside you,
[4792.14 --> 4796.18]  we invite you to say, this is the body of Christ given for you.
[4796.76 --> 4799.06]  As you pass the juice to the person beside you,
[4799.12 --> 4802.18]  we invite you to say, the blood of Christ shed for you.
[4802.60 --> 4804.42]  And then we will go around in that way.
[4804.50 --> 4807.14]  We will all take together, and then you will return to your seats,
[4807.20 --> 4811.34]  and then the next group of 20 to 30 or so people
[4811.34 --> 4814.22]  will come up to the front and be served in that way.
[4814.92 --> 4816.08]  Two notes about that.
[4816.08 --> 4817.92]  If you are unable to come to the front,
[4817.92 --> 4820.78]  but would like to receive the supper,
[4821.00 --> 4822.70]  please indicate that to the elder,
[4822.84 --> 4825.56]  and they will serve you in your seat where you are
[4825.56 --> 4829.18]  with the same words spoken so that you participate in that way.
[4829.62 --> 4831.16]  And throughout this time together,
[4831.16 --> 4834.90]  we'll be led in worship sung by the worship team.
[4835.56 --> 4837.46]  There's also people available for prayer.
[4837.88 --> 4839.86]  And so if you would like to meet with someone to pray,
[4840.36 --> 4842.98]  there'll be a couple people in the foyer at the back.
[4842.98 --> 4844.74]  They would love to meet you and pray with you
[4844.74 --> 4846.24]  either before you come to the front
[4846.24 --> 4847.42]  or after you come to the front
[4847.42 --> 4848.94]  or in lieu of your coming to the front.
[4849.52 --> 4851.78]  However it is that you want to meet them,
[4851.92 --> 4853.78]  they will be there for you in that regard.
[4854.46 --> 4855.86]  To help us facilitate that,
[4855.90 --> 4857.74]  we're going to have the first group come up,
[4857.82 --> 4859.44]  be those who are on the worship team
[4859.44 --> 4860.78]  who are serving back of house,
[4860.86 --> 4862.60]  who are going to be in the back praying
[4862.60 --> 4864.00]  so that we can serve them
[4864.00 --> 4867.78]  and then they can serve us in their task tether.
[4867.88 --> 4870.24]  So I'd like to invite those worship volunteers
[4870.24 --> 4872.84]  and other leaders up to the front at this point.
[4876.24 --> 4877.24]  Amen.
[4877.24 --> 4878.24]  Amen.
[4878.24 --> 4878.66]  Amen.
[4878.66 --> 4878.74]  Amen.
[4878.74 --> 4879.24]  Amen.
[4879.24 --> 4879.74]  Amen.
[4879.74 --> 4880.24]  Amen.
[4900.24 --> 4902.02]  The body of Christ given for you.
[4904.24 --> 4905.86]  The body of Christ given for you.
[4905.86 --> 4926.66]  The body of Christ given for you.
[4926.66 --> 4935.02]  The body of Christ given for you.
[4935.02 --> 4945.62]  eat and remember.
[4959.62 --> 4961.20]  Blood of Christ shed for you.
[4963.16 --> 4964.70]  Blood of Christ shed for you.
[4965.02 --> 4972.18]  Blood of Christ shed for you.
[4973.62 --> 4974.94]  Blood of Christ shed for you.
[4974.94 --> 4998.10]  Blood of Christ shed for you.
[4998.10 --> 5006.50]  Drink and believe.
[5006.50 --> 5014.10]  Amen.
[5014.10 --> 5023.70]  Blood of Christ shed for you.
[5023.70 --> 5053.68]  Thank you.
[5053.70 --> 5083.68]  Thank you.
[5083.70 --> 5113.68]  Thank you.
[5113.70 --> 5115.70]  Thank you.
[5143.70 --> 5145.70]  Thank you.
[5173.70 --> 5175.70]  Thank you.
[5203.70 --> 5205.70]  Thank you.
[5233.70 --> 5247.70]  Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down, here I am to say that you're my call.
[5247.70 --> 5260.70]  You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy, altogether wonderful to me.
[5260.70 --> 5262.70]  Thank you.
[5262.70 --> 5264.70]  Thank you.
[5264.70 --> 5266.70]  Thank you.
[5266.70 --> 5268.70]  Thank you.
[5268.70 --> 5270.70]  Thank you.
[5270.70 --> 5272.70]  Thank you.
[5272.70 --> 5274.70]  Thank you.
[5274.70 --> 5276.70]  Thank you.
[5276.70 --> 5278.70]  Thank you.
[5278.70 --> 5280.70]  Thank you.
[5280.70 --> 5282.70]  Thank you.
[5282.70 --> 5284.70]  Thank you.
[5284.70 --> 5286.70]  Thank you.
[5286.70 --> 5288.70]  All of you.
[5288.86 --> 5291.04]  Thank you.
[5294.70 --> 5296.70]  Thank you.
[5296.70 --> 5298.70]  Thank you.
[5298.70 --> 5300.70]  That is a question and thats end.
[5300.70 --> 5306.50]  Here I am to say that you're my God.
