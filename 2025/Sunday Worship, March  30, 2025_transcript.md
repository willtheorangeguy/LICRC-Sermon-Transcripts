[0.00 --> 6.84]  Let all that you have made bring glory to your name.
[7.14 --> 10.38]  When we fall, you are the Savior.
[10.88 --> 14.24]  When we call, you are the answer.
[14.74 --> 17.58]  There is power in your name.
[18.22 --> 21.48]  There is power in your name.
[21.90 --> 28.92]  In the name of Jesus, there is life and healing.
[28.92 --> 34.78]  Chains are broken in your name.
[36.60 --> 44.72]  Every knee will bow down and our hearts will cry out.
[45.18 --> 49.50]  Songs of freedom in your name.
[50.94 --> 53.04]  Oh, in your name.
[53.04 --> 60.64]  Every chain broken away.
[60.64 --> 64.10]  In your name.

[140.66 --> 141.50]  Oh, in your name.
[141.50 --> 144.66]  There is power.
[146.66 --> 154.30]  There is power in your name.
[168.66 --> 170.66]  There is power in your name.
[170.66 --> 171.66]  There is power in your name.
[171.66 --> 172.66]  There is power in your name.
[172.66 --> 174.06]  There is power in your name.
[174.06 --> 175.82]  Mark, please come back.
[175.82 --> 179.64]  Mark, please come back.
[179.64 --> 184.82]  And put your shoes back on, please.
[184.82 --> 194.54]  Precious cornstone, sure foundation.
[194.54 --> 202.34]  You are faithful to Him.
[202.34 --> 210.04]  We are waiting on You, Jesus.
[210.04 --> 217.04]  We believe You're all to Him.
[217.04 --> 218.04]  Max!

[219.04 --> 220.04]  Max!
[220.04 --> 221.04]  Max!
[221.04 --> 229.04]  Precious cornerstone, sure foundation.
[229.04 --> 237.04]  You are faithful to the end.
[237.04 --> 245.04]  We are waiting on You, Jesus.
[245.04 --> 251.04]  We believe You're all to us.
[251.04 --> 253.04]  Amen.
[253.04 --> 255.04]  Amen.
[255.04 --> 263.04]  Let the glory of Your name be the passion of the church.

[493.22 --> 518.22]  Jesus, you are the Lord, Jesus, you are the Lord, you are the Lord, you are the Lord,
[518.22 --> 523.22]  and forever we will worship you.
[523.22 --> 527.22]  Everything to us.
[548.22 --> 553.22]  We will worship you.
[553.22 --> 556.22]  We will worship you.
[557.22 --> 559.22]  We will worship you.
[559.22 --> 562.22]  We will worship you.
[562.22 --> 565.22]  Faithful.
[565.22 --> 569.22]  Forever you are faithful.
[569.22 --> 576.22]  Father to the Fatherland.
[576.22 --> 584.22]  You uphold the one who feels forsaken.
[586.22 --> 588.22]  Good morning.
[588.22 --> 590.22]  Welcome to worship.
[590.22 --> 591.22]  Worship.
[591.22 --> 593.22]  A special welcome if you are visiting with us today.
[593.22 --> 594.22]  My name is Chris.
[594.22 --> 598.22]  It is our privilege this morning in our worship to welcome Curtis Malista.
[598.22 --> 600.22]  He is going to preach for us later.
[600.22 --> 604.22]  Curtis is a seminary student at Calvin Theological Seminary.
[604.22 --> 610.22]  He used to be one of the pastors at a church here in town and then since moved away and focused on his studies.
[610.22 --> 614.22]  So we are grateful for having Curtis later on in our service show up.
[614.22 --> 620.22]  We have a couple of announcements before we begin our service and the first announcement is going to be a video.
[620.22 --> 622.22]  And so we are going to jump to that right now.
[644.22 --> 664.22]  Let's go to the beach.
[664.22 --> 666.22]  Yeah, okay.
[666.22 --> 668.22]  Where's Josh?
[668.22 --> 669.22]  He's in Mexico.
[669.22 --> 670.22]  He'll meet us at the beach.
[670.22 --> 671.22]  Good for him.
[671.22 --> 674.22]  Getting away before the rush of tree tag.
[674.22 --> 675.22]  Tree tag!
[675.22 --> 678.22]  Kevin, you're looking kind of burnt.
[678.22 --> 681.22]  Like, you're really red.
[681.22 --> 685.22]  Chris, you're not looking burnt but you are looking kind of jaundice.
[685.22 --> 687.22]  I think we should switch spots.
[687.22 --> 690.22]  I thought you said Josh was supposed to be here.
[691.22 --> 695.22]  Swimming, swimming in the ocean blue.
[695.22 --> 697.22]  It's that time of year again.
[697.22 --> 699.22]  Tree tag is back.
[699.22 --> 704.22]  During the month of April, we encourage you to drop off treats of all sorts.
[704.22 --> 705.22]  Like all sorts?
[705.22 --> 706.22]  Yes.
[706.22 --> 709.22]  Treats of all kinds to our church community.
[709.22 --> 712.22]  Whether candies, cards, compliments, or corn chips.
[712.22 --> 719.22]  Drop off a treat tag in someone's church mailbox, at their door, or in some other creative and fun way.
[719.22 --> 726.22]  And remember, if you get tagged, you then have to pass it off to one or six others.
[728.22 --> 730.22]  And so on, and so on.
[730.22 --> 732.22]  It's the game that keeps on giving.
[732.22 --> 737.22]  And try to tag people you don't know yet.
[737.22 --> 739.22]  And remember to include everybody.
[739.22 --> 751.22]  Until then, let's just enjoy the smell of the ocean and the beautiful, restful, absolutely not dangerous, relaxing, peaceful, calming vistas.
[751.22 --> 753.22]  I'm gonna have an app.
[770.22 --> 771.22]  Wanna go fishing?
[771.22 --> 777.94]  Oh, you cut it early.
[778.08 --> 779.26]  The best part was coming.
[779.76 --> 781.00]  You're going to have to watch it online.
[784.42 --> 786.40]  There is a note at the end that says,
[786.48 --> 788.66]  no Joshes were harmed in the making of this short film.
[788.86 --> 790.98]  So you have to go figure out how he gets rescued
[790.98 --> 793.14]  as you check that video out online.
[793.92 --> 795.66]  So the point of that, it's treat tag.
[795.66 --> 797.76]  If you have no idea what that means,
[797.76 --> 801.54]  talk to Pastor Kevin or to myself after the service.
[801.82 --> 803.28]  If you know what that means,
[803.32 --> 804.28]  this is something we've been doing
[804.28 --> 806.42]  for the last four or five years.
[806.88 --> 809.14]  Now, it's just an opportunity to bless one another
[809.14 --> 812.20]  with some treats of some sort and in some way.
[812.32 --> 814.86]  We let you creatively figure that out together.
[815.56 --> 817.76]  So April is the month we do that every year.
[817.90 --> 820.36]  And so we encourage you to start participating in that
[820.36 --> 822.32]  when April starts right away.
[822.72 --> 824.14]  A couple other announcements.
[824.50 --> 826.38]  First of all, worship teams.
[826.38 --> 830.40]  You're having a worship session after church today
[830.40 --> 831.54]  that includes lunch.
[832.10 --> 833.34]  And so if you're on a worship team,
[833.44 --> 836.00]  please stick around after our worship this morning.
[836.16 --> 837.94]  You'll have some time together, some fellowship,
[838.28 --> 842.74]  and work on some emerging worship songs in our midst.
[843.52 --> 846.52]  And then also want to note
[846.52 --> 849.14]  that youth camp registration ends today.
[849.72 --> 851.74]  And so if you haven't registered your youth
[851.74 --> 853.58]  or if you are a youth who hasn't yet registered
[853.58 --> 855.86]  for youth camp, please do that today.
[855.86 --> 857.88]  If you have any questions, again, Pastor Kevin
[857.88 --> 859.20]  will deal with those.
[859.42 --> 861.38]  And then tonight for the youth,
[861.88 --> 864.54]  2020 is happening here at church.
[864.80 --> 867.44]  And that begins at 6.30.
[867.50 --> 867.94]  Thank you.
[868.36 --> 871.52]  And tonight's topic for 2020 is hell.
[873.14 --> 874.52]  So it should be pretty interesting.
[875.40 --> 877.54]  Come on out and have,
[877.70 --> 879.66]  I'm not going to say enjoy a discussion on hell,
[879.66 --> 882.84]  but have a discussion on the reality of hell
[882.84 --> 886.10]  and how we can think about that biblically.
[887.12 --> 888.66]  I think that's it for announcements.
[888.90 --> 889.78]  And so I'm going to invite you,
[889.88 --> 891.18]  as you're able, to stand.
[891.68 --> 894.72]  We can be welcomed into the presence of our God together.
[897.10 --> 899.50]  Following the receiving of God's greeting,
[899.60 --> 901.42]  I'm going to invite you to turn to those around you
[901.42 --> 904.04]  and welcome them in our shared worship this morning
[904.04 --> 905.68]  by passing the peace of Christ.
[905.68 --> 907.08]  So you can say the Lord be with you
[907.08 --> 909.30]  or the peace of Christ be with you,
[909.30 --> 910.56]  or you can just say good morning
[910.56 --> 912.34]  and shake a hand or give a fist bump.
[912.60 --> 914.50]  Receive the blessing of our God.
[916.34 --> 919.50]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you
[919.50 --> 920.60]  from God our Father,
[920.92 --> 922.14]  from the Lord Jesus Christ,
[922.24 --> 923.70]  Son and our Savior,
[924.10 --> 925.24]  through the presence and power
[925.24 --> 926.54]  of the Holy Spirit.
[927.54 --> 927.86]  Amen.
[935.68 --> 936.68]  Amen.
[965.68 --> 972.56]  Good morning.
[973.68 --> 977.30]  Our call to worship this morning is Psalm 13,
[977.46 --> 979.86]  Psalm 13, verses 5 and 6.
[980.60 --> 982.74]  But I trust in your unfailing love.
[983.06 --> 985.32]  My heart rejoices in your salvation.
[986.02 --> 987.74]  I will sing the Lord's praises,
[987.98 --> 989.48]  for he has been good to me.
[990.16 --> 991.54]  Let's worship him together.
[991.54 --> 991.62]  Amen.
[995.68 --> 1024.92]  It begs to the Lord, our God and King,
[1024.92 --> 1027.92]  His love and jones forever.
[1029.12 --> 1032.96]  For he is good, he is a final face,
[1033.26 --> 1035.92]  His love and jones forever.
[1037.02 --> 1042.92]  Sing praise, sing praise.
[1045.06 --> 1048.92]  With a mighty hand and an outstretched arm,
[1048.92 --> 1051.92]  His love and jones forever.
[1051.92 --> 1055.92]  For the life that's been reborn,
[1055.92 --> 1059.92]  His love and jones forever.
[1059.92 --> 1066.92]  Sing praise, sing praise.
[1066.92 --> 1073.92]  Sing praise, sing praise.
[1073.92 --> 1074.92]  For the life that's been made.
[1074.92 --> 1075.92]  For the life that's been made.
[1075.92 --> 1079.92]  Forever God is faithful.
[1079.92 --> 1083.92]  Forever God is strong.
[1083.92 --> 1087.92]  Forever God is with us.
[1087.92 --> 1088.92]  Forever.

[1095.92 --> 1096.92]  Forever.
[1096.92 --> 1097.92]  Forever.
[1097.92 --> 1099.92]  Rising to the setting sun,
[1099.92 --> 1101.92]  His love endures forever.
[1101.92 --> 1102.92]  Forever.
[1102.92 --> 1103.92]  Forever.

[1129.06 --> 1141.92]  Forever God is faithful, forever God is strong, forever God is with us, forever.
[1141.92 --> 1158.00]  Forever you are faithful, forever you are strong, forever you are with us, forever.

[1171.92 --> 1173.92]  Forever.

[1195.92 --> 1197.92]  Forever.
[1197.92 --> 1199.92]  Forever.
[1199.92 --> 1205.92]  You stood before creation, eternity in your heart.
[1205.92 --> 1221.92]  You stood before creation, my soul now to stand.
[1221.92 --> 1233.92]  I stood before my failure, and carried the cross for my shame.
[1233.92 --> 1239.92]  I stood before your shoulder, and my soul now to stand.
[1239.92 --> 1243.92]  I stood before your shoulder, and my soul now to stand.
[1243.92 --> 1249.92]  So what can I say?
[1249.92 --> 1255.92]  And what can I do?
[1255.92 --> 1265.92]  But offer this heart, oh God, completely to you.
[1265.92 --> 1266.92]  You stood before your shoulder, and my soul now to stand.
[1266.92 --> 1267.92]  So what can I say?
[1267.92 --> 1268.92]  I'm not going to stand before your shoulder, and my soul now to stand.
[1268.92 --> 1269.92]  So what can I say?
[1269.92 --> 1270.92]  And what can I do?
[1270.92 --> 1271.92]  And what can I do?
[1271.92 --> 1273.92]  I'm not going to stand before your shoulder, and my soul now to stand.
[1273.92 --> 1274.92]  So what can I say?
[1274.92 --> 1275.92]  And what can I do?
[1275.92 --> 1276.92]  But I'll move in.
[1276.92 --> 1277.92]  I'll move in.
[1277.92 --> 1278.92]  And I'll move in.
[1278.92 --> 1284.80]  I'd like to declare your promise
[1284.80 --> 1288.28]  My soul now to stand
[1288.28 --> 1293.68]  So what can I say?
[1296.44 --> 1299.56]  And what can I do?
[1302.22 --> 1307.30]  But I'll move this far, oh God
[1307.30 --> 1311.26]  Don't we need you?
[1313.96 --> 1316.86]  So what can I say?
[1319.58 --> 1322.62]  And what can I do?
[1325.36 --> 1330.26]  But I'll move this far, oh God
[1330.26 --> 1334.46]  Don't we need you?
[1337.30 --> 1350.48]  So I'll stand with arms high and heart out there
[1350.48 --> 1356.94]  In awe of the one who gave it all
[1356.94 --> 1372.12]  I'll stand with arms high and heart out there
[1372.12 --> 1379.12]  In awe of the one who gave it all
[1379.12 --> 1385.30]  I'll stand with arms high and heart out there
[1385.30 --> 1390.30]  In awe of the one who gave it all
[1390.30 --> 1394.30]  I'll stand with arms high and heart out there
[1394.30 --> 1400.30]  In awe of the one who gave it all
[1400.30 --> 1402.30]  Who gave it all
[1402.30 --> 1405.30]  I'll stand with my soul
[1405.30 --> 1407.30]  Lord, to you surrender
[1407.30 --> 1409.30]  All I am
[1409.30 --> 1413.30]  It's yours all
[1413.30 --> 1415.30]  I am
[1415.30 --> 1417.30]  It's yours all
[1417.30 --> 1424.30]  You may be seated
[1424.30 --> 1429.86]  Please join me in prayer
[1429.86 --> 1434.34]  Gracious and merciful God
[1434.34 --> 1436.86]  We humbly confess our sins
[1436.86 --> 1441.14]  Sins we have committed when we have strayed from your path
[1441.14 --> 1441.98]  In our thoughts
[1441.98 --> 1443.16]  In our words
[1443.16 --> 1444.46]  And in our actions
[1444.46 --> 1447.76]  In the next moment of silent confession
[1447.76 --> 1450.36]  We acknowledge our failures and shortcomings
[1450.36 --> 1453.42]  We seek your forgiveness and healing

[1895.56 --> 1914.50]  The joy of the Lord is my strength.
[1914.50 --> 1922.70]  of the deacons here at Emanuel. Our offerings this morning are first for our budget, which gives to
[1922.70 --> 1928.60]  the ministries and such of this church. If you would like to donate to that, you can use the
[1928.60 --> 1935.08]  envelopes and label it. The envelopes are in your front, should be in the chairs in front of you.
[1935.88 --> 1941.26]  Our second offering this morning is for C10, which is Commissioned to Every Nation.
[1941.26 --> 1948.38]  C10 is a servant organization which helps missionaries to fulfill the vision that God
[1948.38 --> 1954.74]  has given them. Through the administrative support, they provide accountability and they help the
[1954.74 --> 1960.46]  missionaries get to the field. Through their pastoral care, they help the missionaries remain
[1960.46 --> 1968.68]  effective and healthy while they are there. Our church has supported Jody and Uriel Gonzalez
[1968.68 --> 1979.40]  through C10 for a number of years. That's what our offering is for this morning. I have a
[1979.40 --> 1987.30]  letter, note, whatever, directly from Jody. I'm just going to read that to you this morning.
[1988.16 --> 1990.00]  She says, or they do,
[1990.00 --> 1997.36]  Good morning, Emanuel family. As we go through some team withdrawal after having a fabulous time
[1997.36 --> 2004.42]  with them here, we first want to say a great big thank you. Thank you for faithfully sending a group
[2004.42 --> 2010.58]  to our area of the world. Having church family come and work here for a time truly keeps us motivated.
[2010.58 --> 2019.66]  Even though the team has returned home, the work here continues. 18 men are currently living at Alfaro
[2019.66 --> 2027.02]  men's home. A quick story. There was a gentleman who was found on the side of the road near death. He was
[2027.02 --> 2033.36]  brought to a local rehab and stayed there for a few months. They contacted Uriel to see if we had a bed
[2033.36 --> 2041.06]  for him. He came with nothing. He was clean and sober, but he was empty and lost. He knew the Lord,
[2041.30 --> 2049.42]  but had walked away. He's now going to church and he starts a new job on Monday. God is working in him.
[2049.96 --> 2057.04]  This is just one of the many lives that are changing here at Alfaro. I, Jody, have started a women's group
[2057.04 --> 2063.38]  called Interwoven. Two Saturdays a month, a group of ladies get together to knit, crochet, latch hook,
[2063.54 --> 2068.98]  sew, whatever. I have a sewing machine, but don't know how to use it. A lady asked if she could use
[2068.98 --> 2075.30]  it during our interwoven time to make curtains for her home. Yes. Another lady has offered to teach us
[2075.30 --> 2082.20]  how to sew. We have 17 regular ladies, Spanish and English speaking, who come during our drop-in times.
[2082.20 --> 2088.28]  This is a new type of outreach ministry that is opening up doors of opportunity in our area.
[2089.16 --> 2094.94]  Emmanuel family, thank you for your continued support. Your faithfulness in praying for us
[2094.94 --> 2101.98]  and giving of your finances makes this possible. God is using you to help us help others.
[2102.54 --> 2107.12]  Jody, Uriel, Jonathan, and Antonio. Let's give as God has given to us.
[2112.20 --> 2134.08]  Suosda, the FROM THE BRUS mismo called
[2134.08 --> 2143.46]  Man of Soros have gone by his own betrayal.
[2143.46 --> 2155.70]  The sin of Man of Atta gone has killed Jesus' name.
[2155.70 --> 2168.70]  Silent as he stood accused, beaten, rocked, and stoned.
[2168.70 --> 2180.70]  Fowing to the Father's will, he took the crown of thorns.
[2180.70 --> 2192.84]  O that rugged cross, my salvation, with your love poured out over me.
[2192.84 --> 2203.74]  Now my soul cries out, hallelujah, praise and honor of Jesus.
[2203.74 --> 2216.74]  Set a heaven God's own Son to purchase and redeem.
[2216.74 --> 2227.74]  And red and solidary ones who nailed him to the tree.
[2227.74 --> 2238.74]  Hold that rugged cross, my salvation, with your love poured out over me.
[2238.74 --> 2248.74]  Now my soul cries out, hallelujah, praise and honor of Jesus.
[2248.74 --> 2259.08]  Now my debt is paid, it is paid in full.
[2259.08 --> 2264.66]  By the precious blood that my Jesus built.
[2265.00 --> 2270.16]  Now the curse of sin has no hold on me.
[2270.44 --> 2275.34]  When the Son stands free, always free indeed.
[2275.34 --> 2302.80]  Oh that rugged cross, my salvation.
[2302.80 --> 2308.80]  When the Son stands free, always free indeed.
[2308.80 --> 2318.80]  Now my soul cries out, hallelujah, praise and honor unto thee.
[2318.80 --> 2327.80]  See the stone is rolled away.
[2327.80 --> 2332.80]  Behold the empty tomb.
[2332.80 --> 2334.80]  Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise and honor unto thee.
[2334.80 --> 2339.80]  Hallelujah, God be praised, he's risen from the grave.
[2339.80 --> 2343.80]  He's risen from the grave.
[2343.80 --> 2353.80]  Oh my rugged cross, my salvation, with your love poured out over me.
[2353.80 --> 2365.80]  And my soul cries out, hallelujah, praise and honor unto thee.
[2365.80 --> 2371.80]  Praise and honor unto thee.
[2371.80 --> 2381.80]  Good morning.
[2381.80 --> 2382.80]  Good morning.
[2382.80 --> 2387.80]  My name is Mr. Mike and I'd like to invite all the four-year-olds up to grade four to come up for Kids Corner
[2387.80 --> 2390.80]  before we head off to Children's Worship Time.
[2390.80 --> 2392.80]  Oh boy, you can't get any closer.
[2392.80 --> 2393.80]  Ooh.
[2394.80 --> 2395.80]  Come on up.
[2398.80 --> 2400.80]  Okay, oh, oh.
[2400.80 --> 2403.80]  Okay guys, it's pretty nice out.
[2403.80 --> 2406.80]  I'm feeling pretty good about myself today.
[2406.80 --> 2408.80]  How are you guys feeling?
[2408.80 --> 2409.80]  Good?
[2409.80 --> 2410.80]  Oh, oh boy.
[2410.80 --> 2412.80]  Okay, this might go in my direction.
[2412.80 --> 2416.80]  I'm feeling so good about myself, I kind of think I'm better than you guys.
[2416.80 --> 2417.80]  Huh?
[2417.80 --> 2419.80]  What do you guys think?
[2419.80 --> 2421.80]  Oh, not so sure, eh?
[2421.80 --> 2425.80]  Okay, well, let's have a little competition then, shall we?
[2425.80 --> 2430.80]  Have their brave soul who thinks they want to come up against me for who's better?
[2430.80 --> 2431.80]  Huh?
[2431.80 --> 2433.80]  How about we have these two girls come on up.
[2433.80 --> 2434.80]  Okay.
[2434.80 --> 2438.80]  All right, first up, I think I'm better because I'm taller.
[2438.80 --> 2440.80]  Let's see, back to back.
[2440.80 --> 2441.80]  Who's taller?
[2441.80 --> 2442.80]  Who's taller?
[2442.80 --> 2443.80]  Me?
[2443.80 --> 2446.80]  Oh, okay, well, thank you.
[2446.80 --> 2448.80]  Does that make me better?
[2448.80 --> 2449.80]  Oh.
[2449.80 --> 2451.80]  Okay, all right, I'll try again.
[2451.80 --> 2452.80]  Let's see.
[2452.80 --> 2453.80]  Oh, what's this?
[2453.80 --> 2454.80]  Oh.
[2454.80 --> 2457.80]  I know how to drive.
[2457.80 --> 2460.80]  Do you know how to drive?
[2460.80 --> 2461.80]  No.
[2461.80 --> 2462.80]  Oh.
[2462.80 --> 2464.80]  Maybe that makes me better.
[2464.80 --> 2465.80]  No.
[2465.80 --> 2466.80]  What?
[2466.80 --> 2469.80]  Oh, every parent knows how to drive, she says.
[2469.80 --> 2470.80]  Sure, sure.
[2470.80 --> 2473.80]  Okay, all right, I'll try again.
[2473.80 --> 2476.80]  How much money you got?
[2476.80 --> 2481.80]  We're not going to sense my sense of balance, that's for sure.
[2481.80 --> 2482.80]  60 million.
[2482.80 --> 2483.80]  You, what?
[2483.80 --> 2484.80]  Oh, look at this.
[2484.80 --> 2485.80]  Look at this.
[2485.80 --> 2486.80]  Thousand.
[2486.80 --> 2492.80]  How do you, how do you guys, oh, okay, well, paper.
[2492.80 --> 2493.80]  Okay, all right, all right.
[2493.80 --> 2495.80]  Maybe that didn't work.
[2495.80 --> 2496.80]  Maybe that didn't work.
[2496.80 --> 2499.80]  Oh, someone's, you got American money?
[2499.80 --> 2501.80]  Oh, my goodness.
[2501.80 --> 2502.80]  All right, all right.
[2502.80 --> 2504.80]  Take that one off the list.
[2504.80 --> 2511.80]  How about, all right, you guys, I think you got a nice dress on, do you?
[2511.80 --> 2513.80]  Let's see.
[2513.80 --> 2524.80]  This makes me better, eh?
[2524.80 --> 2529.80]  No, oh, oh, a little heckling from the audience.
[2529.80 --> 2531.80]  All right, it always works in my favor.
[2531.80 --> 2534.80]  All right, well, I got the last piece de resistance.
[2534.80 --> 2537.80]  This is gonna top it off.
[2537.80 --> 2538.80]  All right.
[2538.80 --> 2540.80]  We all saw the game last night, huh?
[2540.80 --> 2541.80]  Huh?
[2541.80 --> 2543.80]  I am wearing the blood, though.
[2543.80 --> 2545.80]  But are you a fan of these guys, huh?
[2545.80 --> 2547.80]  Does that make you better, make me better?
[2547.80 --> 2548.80]  No.
[2548.80 --> 2549.80]  What?
[2549.80 --> 2550.80]  No?
[2550.80 --> 2552.80]  Oh, okay, all right.
[2552.80 --> 2554.80]  All right, I'm struggling.
[2554.80 --> 2557.80]  Well, we've been talking about the Book of Mark.
[2557.80 --> 2563.80]  Thank you, ladies, for your brave efforts coming up against me.
[2563.80 --> 2566.80]  We've been talking about the Book of Mark in Children's Bershive Time, right?
[2566.80 --> 2573.80]  And all about the different things that make us who we are and our identity in Jesus.
[2573.80 --> 2580.80]  And a big one is none of us is better than the other person because we're all children of God.
[2580.80 --> 2582.80]  So we're gonna talk more about that today, okay?
[2582.80 --> 2585.80]  So let's do that in Children's Bershive Time.
[2585.80 --> 2591.80]  But before then, let's stand and we'll bless the congregation that's gonna stay here and learn from Pastor Chris.
[2591.80 --> 2594.80]  And we are gonna learn a little bit more.
[2594.80 --> 2595.80]  Oh, Curtis.
[2595.80 --> 2596.80]  That's right.
[2596.80 --> 2598.80]  Pastor Curtis is here today.
[2598.80 --> 2600.80]  All right, let's do this together.
[2600.80 --> 2601.80]  Arms up.
[2601.80 --> 2621.80]  Good morning.
[2621.80 --> 2622.80]  My name is Ken.
[2622.80 --> 2626.80]  I just have one quick announcement before Steve has some announcements from Council.
[2626.80 --> 2635.80]  Every first Saturday of the month, our church gathers with folks up the hill at the retirement community, Sunridge Gardens.
[2635.80 --> 2637.80]  And we have a church service at 2 p.m.
[2637.80 --> 2638.80]  So that's coming up this Saturday.
[2638.80 --> 2643.80]  And for anyone who's been wondering what that's about, it's kind of a small, intimate setting.
[2643.80 --> 2646.80]  We're sitting around on chairs kind of in a circle sort of set up around a piano.
[2646.80 --> 2651.80]  We sing some of the old classic hymns and songs and then have a small message.
[2651.80 --> 2656.80]  And we sit together and share story and life with folks up there.
[2656.80 --> 2659.80]  And there's a number of our church members who are residents at Sunridge as well.
[2659.80 --> 2664.80]  So if you've ever been thinking about coming out or if you're wondering a bit more about it, please reach out to me.
[2664.80 --> 2667.80]  And I can give you a little more info.
[2667.80 --> 2669.80]  And Saturday at 2 p.m. we'll be meeting there.
[2669.80 --> 2673.80]  So we'd love to see more of you there. Thanks.
[2673.80 --> 2674.80]  Thanks.
[2674.80 --> 2675.80]  I'm up here.
[2675.80 --> 2679.80]  Steve is an elder to announce a few reminders.
[2679.80 --> 2687.80]  Next week, Tuesday, I think it is, April 8th, we have a town hall to discuss the job description for a second pastor.
[2687.80 --> 2694.80]  And the other announcements we've got, we're in the nomination process for pastoral elders and deacons.
[2694.80 --> 2698.80]  So there's details in the bulletin about that. And yeah, so check that out.
[2698.80 --> 2701.80]  And I'll hand it off to Sarah here.
[2701.80 --> 2706.80]  Good morning.
[2706.80 --> 2713.80]  Before we dive into, people usually introduce themselves up here.
[2713.80 --> 2720.80]  My name is Sarah. I am one of your sisters in Christ here at Emanuel.
[2720.80 --> 2728.80]  And just a note of change to one of the prayer request items.
[2728.80 --> 2733.80]  And Tessa, Jerry Jansen's daughter and Enochalas' sister.
[2733.80 --> 2739.80]  She had some surgery to remove a tumor.
[2739.80 --> 2745.80]  She's regaining some strength but still has some more treatment ahead.
[2745.80 --> 2748.80]  So just an adjustment to what was written there.
[2748.80 --> 2756.80]  And then Joan, Clary Klosterhof's sister, has stage 3 cancer and is starting treatment.
[2756.80 --> 2761.80]  So we'll keep them in our prayers along with the list we have here.
[2761.80 --> 2764.80]  Join me in prayer.
[2768.80 --> 2774.80]  Heavenly Father, we come to you in prayer, lifting up our community.
[2774.80 --> 2782.80]  We thank you for each person sitting here and those who cannot be here with us.
[2782.80 --> 2789.80]  Lord, we think especially of those who have sickness who can't be with us.
[2789.80 --> 2793.80]  Those who have mobility issues who can't be with us.
[2793.80 --> 2797.80]  Those who aren't feeling well who are at home.
[2797.80 --> 2802.80]  And we pray that they would feel your arm around them.
[2802.80 --> 2806.80]  And the extension of community in whatever space they're in.
[2809.80 --> 2811.80]  Lord, we thank you that you hear our prayers.
[2813.80 --> 2816.80]  And we first want to bring our thanksgiving before you.
[2816.80 --> 2823.80]  Our thanksgiving for the Mexico team who went down during spring break.
[2823.80 --> 2831.80]  Lord, the bountiful of experiences, of joys, of connection.
[2831.80 --> 2836.80]  Lord, there was a youth conference that our team hosted.
[2836.80 --> 2839.80]  A children's festival.
[2839.80 --> 2844.80]  And they engaged with the church that were connected there.
[2844.80 --> 2847.80]  And the Gonzales family, Lord, and their ministry.
[2847.80 --> 2857.80]  Lord, we thank you for those connections and the family that has been developed over the years.
[2857.80 --> 2861.80]  Over 30 years, Lord, we thank you for that.
[2861.80 --> 2864.80]  Your goodness in those relationships.
[2864.80 --> 2870.80]  And for the experiences for the team and for the people who live there, Lord.
[2871.80 --> 2874.80]  Also thinking about spring break.
[2874.80 --> 2880.80]  We thank you for the rest that some have been able to have, Lord.
[2880.80 --> 2883.80]  And the travel and family time.
[2883.80 --> 2885.80]  Lord, we thank you for that.
[2885.80 --> 2890.80]  And we pray for everyone heading back into school.
[2890.80 --> 2896.80]  We pray for parents as maybe they get back into their work routine.
[2896.80 --> 2899.80]  For kids as they get back into their school routine.
[2899.80 --> 2901.80]  Transitions can be hard.
[2901.80 --> 2907.80]  And we pray that you give us each a generous measure of patience for each other.
[2907.80 --> 2916.80]  Lord, we also bring up in thanksgiving for the successful surgeries.
[2916.80 --> 2920.80]  Hip replacement for Emily Klingelting and Judy Versteg.
[2920.80 --> 2924.80]  Lord, both of them had smooth procedures.
[2924.80 --> 2929.80]  And we thank you so much that those went well.
[2929.80 --> 2931.80]  And we pray for the recovery process.
[2931.80 --> 2933.80]  Lord, it can be long.
[2933.80 --> 2934.80]  It can be slow.
[2934.80 --> 2936.80]  It can be challenging.
[2936.80 --> 2940.80]  And so I pray that you would give them patience.
[2940.80 --> 2947.80]  And that their community and family would surround them as they regain their strength.
[2947.80 --> 2960.80]  Lord, we turn to you asking for your strength for those who are struggling with health issues.
[2960.80 --> 2965.80]  We first lift up those with mental health challenges.
[2965.80 --> 2970.80]  Lord, this can be really hard.
[2970.80 --> 2974.80]  We have all been touched by it.
[2974.80 --> 2977.80]  Whether ourselves or knowing someone.
[2977.80 --> 2981.80]  Or maybe even we don't know the person beside us.
[2981.80 --> 2983.80]  What they're struggling with.
[2983.80 --> 2985.80]  Sometimes it can be hidden.
[2985.80 --> 2989.80]  Sometimes it can be right in front of our face, Lord.
[2989.80 --> 2995.80]  And sometimes we don't know how to deal with it.
[2996.80 --> 3000.80]  And maybe sometimes it's something that can't be dealt with.
[3000.80 --> 3003.80]  And we just need to sit in that.
[3003.80 --> 3017.80]  Lord, give us the patience and the grace and the love that we need to sit with people as they walk hard, dark roads.
[3017.80 --> 3024.80]  May your peace and comfort and healing surround those who are struggling with mental health challenges.
[3024.80 --> 3029.80]  And we pray for strength.
[3029.80 --> 3034.80]  Lord, we also want to lift up those who are having physical challenges.
[3034.80 --> 3038.80]  We think especially of Tara and her family.
[3038.80 --> 3040.80]  Her husband.
[3040.80 --> 3046.80]  He's been suffering from a disintegrating disc disease.
[3046.80 --> 3052.80]  For those of us who don't have or haven't had back pain.
[3052.80 --> 3060.80]  We probably don't even know the measure of pain that he has experienced and is continuing to experience.
[3061.80 --> 3064.80]  Lord, we pray for strength in that.
[3065.80 --> 3067.80]  We pray for healing.
[3068.80 --> 3071.80]  We pray that the right treatments would come along.
[3072.80 --> 3077.80]  We give wisdom to the doctors who are involved in his care.
[3077.80 --> 3087.80]  Lord, we also think of Tara's brother-in-law who's in the hospital after suffering two strokes.
[3089.80 --> 3098.80]  This wild change of life is hard for him and is hard for the family around him.
[3098.80 --> 3101.80]  It's a long road, Lord.
[3101.80 --> 3103.80]  A lot of changes.
[3103.80 --> 3106.80]  We pray for patience.
[3107.80 --> 3114.80]  We pray that that slow progression would bring a sense of comfort for them.
[3115.80 --> 3117.80]  But we know that it can be hard.
[3117.80 --> 3120.80]  It can be really hard, the changes in life that that brings.
[3120.80 --> 3127.80]  And so we pray that you would be with him in those moments.
[3130.80 --> 3133.80]  We also want to lift up Lena.
[3134.80 --> 3138.80]  Lena is back in the hospital after having a fall.
[3141.80 --> 3144.80]  Lord, we pray for whatever pain that she's experiencing.
[3144.80 --> 3152.80]  And we pray that things would move along so that they can determine what needs to be done for her.
[3153.80 --> 3154.80]  Lord.
[3159.80 --> 3164.80]  We also pray for the parents in our midst with sick children.
[3165.80 --> 3167.80]  The children who keep getting sick.
[3167.80 --> 3173.80]  Who seem to recover for maybe a day, maybe a week, and then get sick again and bring it home.
[3173.80 --> 3176.80]  And then the parents get sick, Lord.
[3176.80 --> 3179.80]  This can be a very frustrating cycle.
[3180.80 --> 3187.80]  Especially with plans and life going on, having to cancel, having to move things around, having to be flexible.
[3188.80 --> 3191.80]  And Lord, the toll of having to take care of sick children.
[3192.80 --> 3197.80]  It can be hard to have patience in those moments.
[3197.80 --> 3199.80]  And maybe hard to have strength.
[3199.80 --> 3203.80]  Lord, I pray that you would bring healing.
[3203.80 --> 3205.80]  We thank you for this warm weather.
[3206.80 --> 3209.80]  That we can all go outside and enjoy it.
[3209.80 --> 3211.80]  And we pray for more sun.
[3212.80 --> 3216.80]  And pray that that would boost our health, Lord.
[3218.80 --> 3220.80]  But we know that sickness comes around.
[3220.80 --> 3224.80]  And so we pray for those that are continuing to struggle with that, that you would walk with them.
[3226.80 --> 3228.80]  Lord, we also pray for Tessa.
[3229.80 --> 3233.80]  As we learned that she had surgery to remove a tumor.
[3234.80 --> 3239.80]  And she's regaining strength, which is good and encouraging, but she has a road ahead of her still.
[3239.80 --> 3262.80]  Lord, this, for some of us, for those especially close to her, can be really hard to watch the process of treatment and hope for healing, but not knowing the future.
[3262.80 --> 3277.80]  Lord, we also pray for Doug, Elise Wagner's dad, Tanya, Amanda Hogawoning's sister and class test maker's daughter.
[3277.80 --> 3284.80]  These are all people in our communities who are struggling with cancer.
[3285.80 --> 3289.80]  As well as Joan, Clary's sister.
[3293.80 --> 3295.80]  Sometimes we don't understand it.
[3295.80 --> 3300.80]  And that's really hard.
[3301.80 --> 3302.80]  We don't understand the why.
[3304.80 --> 3308.80]  We don't necessarily see the hope.
[3309.80 --> 3311.80]  But we hold on to that glimmer of hope.
[3312.80 --> 3314.80]  That you are our God.
[3317.80 --> 3320.80]  And that you hold everything and everyone in your hands.
[3320.80 --> 3324.80]  Which sometimes can make us angry.
[3326.80 --> 3327.80]  In the why.
[3328.80 --> 3334.80]  We pray that you would soften our hearts and open us to your love.
[3335.80 --> 3337.80]  And hear your voice.
[3337.80 --> 3338.80]  I hear you.
[3339.80 --> 3340.80]  I see you.
[3341.80 --> 3342.80]  In the tears by the hospital beds.
[3343.80 --> 3347.80]  In the hard times when life is changing.
[3347.80 --> 3348.80]  Be with us, Lord.
[3350.80 --> 3352.80]  Thank you for listening to our prayers.
[3355.80 --> 3356.80]  We pray.
[3357.80 --> 3361.80]  As we turn to your message, Lord.
[3362.80 --> 3363.80]  That you would be with Curtis.
[3364.80 --> 3368.80]  And that you would open our hearts and our eyes to see you and hear your word.
[3369.80 --> 3370.80]  In your name we pray.
[3370.80 --> 3371.80]  Amen.
[3371.80 --> 3372.80]  Good morning.
[3373.80 --> 3374.80]  Good morning.
[3374.80 --> 3376.80]  It's good to be here.
[3376.80 --> 3378.80]  See some familiar faces.
[3378.80 --> 3391.58]  Good morning.
[3393.10 --> 3396.26]  It's good to be here, see some familiar faces.
[3397.32 --> 3399.52]  For those of you who don't know me, my name is Curtis Maliefsta.
[3400.10 --> 3404.68]  I'm a member at Cornerstone Christian Reformed Church in Salmon Arm, and so I bring greetings
[3404.68 --> 3406.78]  from your sister church up in the interior.
[3406.78 --> 3413.08]  And I know this building, this church family has a special place in the hearts of some
[3413.08 --> 3417.16]  of us because of Reactivate, and many of our youth look forward to coming here every year,
[3417.26 --> 3417.90]  as do I.
[3418.88 --> 3423.98]  So I would invite you to turn in your Bibles to Colossians chapter 1 with me.
[3424.68 --> 3430.58]  We're going to read the first 14 verses, and we're going to focus on the last few, verses
[3430.58 --> 3431.42]  9 to 14.
[3436.78 --> 3442.08]  Colossians chapter 1, verse 1, Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God and Timothy,
[3442.24 --> 3447.74]  our brother, to the saints and faithful brothers in Christ at Colossae, grace to you and peace
[3447.74 --> 3448.78]  from God our Father.
[3448.78 --> 3454.16]  We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you, since we
[3454.16 --> 3459.46]  heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all the saints because
[3459.46 --> 3461.30]  of the hope laid up for you in heaven.
[3461.96 --> 3466.58]  Of this you have heard before in the word of truth, the gospel, which has come to you
[3466.58 --> 3471.72]  as indeed in the whole world that is bearing fruit and increasing as it also does among
[3471.72 --> 3477.16]  you since the day you heard it and understood the grace of God in truth, just as you learned
[3477.16 --> 3480.26]  it from Epaphras, our fellow beloved servant.
[3480.96 --> 3486.32]  He is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf and has made known to us your love in
[3486.32 --> 3486.68]  the Spirit.
[3487.80 --> 3492.66]  And so, from the day we heard, we have not ceased to pray for you, asking that you may
[3492.66 --> 3497.98]  be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, so
[3497.98 --> 3504.12]  as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him, bearing fruit in every
[3504.12 --> 3510.88]  good work and increasing in the knowledge of God, being strengthened with all power, according
[3510.88 --> 3516.32]  to his glorious might for all endurance and patience with joy, giving thanks to the Father
[3516.32 --> 3521.24]  who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in light.
[3521.84 --> 3527.48]  He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his
[3527.48 --> 3532.54]  beloved Son in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
[3533.04 --> 3534.16]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3534.88 --> 3535.90]  Thanks be to God.
[3536.38 --> 3537.44]  Let's pray together.
[3538.58 --> 3543.58]  Our Father in heaven, we come before your throne this morning and we ask now that you would
[3543.58 --> 3548.62]  give us ears to hear, that you might anoint the preaching of your word by your Holy Spirit
[3548.62 --> 3554.44]  to sound forth with great power and authority, and that you might do a work in our hearts,
[3554.44 --> 3557.12]  just what each one of us needs to hear.
[3557.78 --> 3559.26]  We pray this in Jesus' name.
[3559.44 --> 3559.68]  Amen.
[3562.36 --> 3567.02]  You've likely heard the phrase, walk the walk, don't just talk the talk.
[3567.46 --> 3569.78]  This is a common phrase, pregnant with meaning.
[3569.90 --> 3570.66]  It gets thrown about.
[3570.80 --> 3576.14]  I remember hearing it in elementary school, and I don't know how much it gets used today,
[3576.14 --> 3581.78]  but it's funny that this is still a common phrase, and yet we hear an echo of it in the
[3581.78 --> 3586.72]  text in Colossians where Paul talks about walking in a manner worthy of the Lord.
[3587.66 --> 3590.22]  What we do regularly and what Paul is doing is the same thing.
[3590.22 --> 3598.60]  He's drawing on ancient wisdom literature to say that the path of life often is exemplified
[3598.60 --> 3599.48]  in this pathway.
[3599.66 --> 3601.26]  We can walk in a manner worthy of the Lord.
[3601.26 --> 3607.72]  We can choose two paths, two paths diverge in a yellow wood, as Robert Frost has said.
[3609.42 --> 3613.40]  And so I was wondering when I came across this passage, well, what does Paul really mean
[3613.40 --> 3615.08]  when he says walk in a manner worthy of the Lord?
[3615.10 --> 3620.82]  Because embedded within this Thanksgiving section of Paul is some encouragement and some advice
[3620.82 --> 3627.00]  from Paul to the church in Colossae, and now from God through Paul to us today, this morning.
[3627.00 --> 3632.04]  And so the question that we have is what is in there for us?
[3632.08 --> 3634.84]  Because the Bible is not written to us, it's written for us.
[3634.88 --> 3639.44]  So when Paul says to the church, walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, we should know what
[3639.44 --> 3643.68]  that means generally, and maybe we should think a little bit more specifically about that.
[3643.80 --> 3644.80]  And so that's what we're going to look at.
[3646.30 --> 3651.68]  The words that God has given to the church in Colossae and indeed for us this morning is
[3651.68 --> 3656.18]  fitting for us today because of the hope laid up in heaven that Paul mentions in verse
[3656.18 --> 3663.22]  five, which is the good news that Christ conquers, has conquered sin and reigns victorious on
[3663.22 --> 3665.62]  the earth, and that is indeed good news.
[3666.08 --> 3669.40]  Because brothers and sisters, what really could be better news than that?
[3669.46 --> 3674.38]  The same God that paid the price for you, the same God that rules over all creation, the
[3674.38 --> 3681.84]  same God that has created it, the same God who's created and fashioned you, desires you,
[3682.30 --> 3684.08]  wants to rescue you, wants to redeem you.
[3684.08 --> 3689.12]  And indeed he has done that on the cross and he wants to walk with you and talk with you.
[3690.34 --> 3695.86]  And so from this passage, we are to be encouraged in our walk with Christ.
[3696.38 --> 3703.70]  We are to be empowered in our walk with Christ and we can be emboldened in our walk with Christ.
[3704.00 --> 3706.48]  Encouraged, empowered, and emboldened.
[3706.48 --> 3713.86]  Paul tends to write his letters in a similar style and this letter to the church in Colossae
[3713.86 --> 3715.38]  is no different.
[3716.00 --> 3720.18]  He greets the church always, you're probably familiar with that, and then he enters into
[3720.18 --> 3724.52]  a little section of thanksgiving where he thanks the church for the things that they
[3724.52 --> 3729.04]  are doing and he reminds them of what Paul is thankful for.
[3729.04 --> 3733.56]  And there's a few notable moments in this particular thanksgiving section.
[3734.20 --> 3738.12]  The preceding verses, not part of our focus, but the context is important.
[3739.18 --> 3742.84]  Paul's thankful for the love of the saints for their fellow Christians.
[3743.56 --> 3746.32]  He's thankful for the work of God among them.
[3746.88 --> 3750.98]  And he is thankful for Epaphras, this fellow beloved minister.
[3750.98 --> 3754.68]  But in verse 9, the tone of the thanksgiving shifts.
[3755.66 --> 3758.96]  The and so indicates that there's a shift in the tone.
[3759.02 --> 3762.80]  And this isn't just because Paul wants to make another list, it's because he's doing
[3762.80 --> 3763.74]  something else.
[3764.38 --> 3770.30]  As Pastor Chris probably remembers from New Testament class with Dr. Wyma, Paul is a very
[3770.30 --> 3771.06]  good letter writer.
[3771.90 --> 3776.30]  And when he makes shifts in the way he writes, we should pay attention because he doesn't do
[3776.30 --> 3778.68]  these things by accident.
[3778.68 --> 3785.64]  And so, Paul makes this shift and he brings out this idiom of walking through life.
[3786.12 --> 3788.78]  And this is Paul's encouragement to the Colossians.
[3789.70 --> 3794.30]  It might be similar if I came here and I said, thank you, Langley, Emmanuel, Christian
[3794.30 --> 3796.34]  Form Church for welcoming me into your pulpit.
[3796.62 --> 3801.22]  I've heard from my good friend Kevin that you guys are all very good at listening to sermons.
[3802.06 --> 3803.16]  And you might think, oh, that's very nice.
[3803.24 --> 3804.24]  Kevin said that about us.
[3804.48 --> 3805.44]  I know Curtis affirmed it.
[3805.44 --> 3810.60]  But what's really going on is I'm encouraging you to continue in that way, that you would
[3810.60 --> 3811.50]  be more inclined.
[3811.54 --> 3812.74]  We do this with our kids all the time.
[3813.28 --> 3815.08]  My kids do something good and I say, oh, good job.
[3815.12 --> 3816.12]  That's really good that you did that.
[3816.30 --> 3820.12]  It's not because I just want to thank them for doing it, because I want to encourage them
[3820.12 --> 3821.58]  to do more of that good thing.
[3822.26 --> 3823.66]  And so, Paul does the same thing.
[3823.66 --> 3830.46]  And so, he does this by saying that he's praying for them to be filled with the knowledge of
[3830.46 --> 3835.42]  God's will, to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to bear good fruit, and to increase
[3835.42 --> 3836.44]  in the knowledge of God.
[3836.86 --> 3841.04]  These are things that the Colossians have been doing through the work of Epaphras and through
[3841.04 --> 3841.82]  the work of the Holy Spirit.
[3842.26 --> 3844.30]  And Paul wants them to do more of it.
[3844.30 --> 3850.26]  And so, we know what they're doing because of Epaphras, and Paul wants to encourage them
[3850.26 --> 3851.52]  in those ways.
[3851.64 --> 3853.00]  But why does he want to do that?
[3853.60 --> 3856.48]  Because these are things that the church in Colossae struggled with.
[3856.62 --> 3862.26]  Colossae was on a significant trade route in Asia Minor, which meant like many cities
[3862.26 --> 3867.38]  of their day, they were pressured by many different worldviews and religions.
[3867.38 --> 3874.52]  And so, in this particular city, there was significant worship of Zeus, of Apollo, of Artemis, and
[3874.52 --> 3878.98]  of course, the imperial cult where everybody was called to worship the Caesar.
[3880.60 --> 3887.02]  And so, Paul is encouraging these Christians to be different than the world around them and
[3887.02 --> 3890.64]  to live in according to their understanding of Christ.
[3891.56 --> 3897.30]  He encourages them in four ways to exemplify this lifestyle, bearing fruit, growing, being
[3897.30 --> 3898.74]  empowered, and giving thanks.
[3899.38 --> 3904.24]  And according to the Scriptures, these are aspects of the Christian life that make Christian
[3904.24 --> 3907.96]  living unique compared to other ways of life.
[3909.08 --> 3914.34]  And what's important to notice here in that by the way of Paul's writing, he's encouraging
[3914.34 --> 3920.32]  the church in Colossae and indeed encouraging us today to increase in these areas of life because
[3920.32 --> 3923.32]  that is what God desires for His disciples.
[3923.32 --> 3929.50]  These features of the Christian life and of the Colossian Christians should increase in them.
[3930.88 --> 3931.88]  What are they bearing fruit?
[3932.30 --> 3935.20]  Growing in the knowledge of Christ, being empowered, and giving thanks.
[3936.98 --> 3939.70]  But Paul doesn't leave the Colossians without hope.
[3939.76 --> 3942.36]  He doesn't just say, do more of that, and then he leaves them there.
[3942.76 --> 3947.84]  Because we know, probably quite intimately, if we examine our own hearts and our own souls,
[3947.84 --> 3951.30]  that sometimes this feels like a futile effort.
[3952.10 --> 3956.54]  The best laid plans are often abandoned when it comes to Christian discipleship.
[3956.60 --> 3962.30]  Who's already given up on their 2025 Bible reading plan because they fell too far behind?
[3962.72 --> 3968.18]  Why do we have a litany of confession and assurance every single week in our Sunday worship?
[3968.28 --> 3973.58]  It's because we know we come into this place having failed at what we've desired to do around
[3973.58 --> 3974.94]  Christian living.
[3976.88 --> 3982.84]  For the Colossian Christians in the first century, to be a Christian was a monumental task.
[3983.32 --> 3986.40]  Having to resist the cultural and political pressures at every turn.
[3986.66 --> 3989.38]  It's not really unlike our world today.
[3990.24 --> 3992.16]  Consider this reality for a moment.
[3992.28 --> 3997.52]  It wasn't long ago that the invention of radio and television transformed our world.
[3998.52 --> 4000.36]  Some people might even remember that still.
[4000.36 --> 4006.76]  And then the TV arrived and the internet arrived and the smartphone arrived and it changed our world even more.
[4008.28 --> 4014.20]  If you could imagine for a moment, or maybe you can remember, being raised in a Christian home
[4014.20 --> 4016.82]  before the advent of radio, television, and the internet,
[4016.82 --> 4025.48]  it was easy as parents to have control over what messages your children received or what messages you received.
[4025.48 --> 4030.56]  And there's times in the world where we have to recede, we have to retreat from the world,
[4030.62 --> 4031.54]  and now is the time to do that.
[4031.58 --> 4035.78]  We come into the sanctuary on Sunday morning to worship God and hear the Word and be fed.
[4036.70 --> 4038.32]  But there's also times to engage with the world.
[4038.44 --> 4041.70]  I don't want to say that, you know, we should run from the world all the time.
[4042.04 --> 4043.22]  We have to engage with the world.
[4043.28 --> 4046.08]  We have to do groceries and do our civic duties and whatnot.
[4046.08 --> 4051.10]  But we live in a world now, very similar to the Colossian world,
[4051.48 --> 4058.34]  where the line between the haven of our homes and the danger of the world out there can be very blurred.
[4059.04 --> 4063.02]  Most of us have giant TV screens in our living room,
[4063.42 --> 4065.82]  and what rolls across those TV screens regularly?
[4066.36 --> 4068.50]  Advertisements and worldly messaging.
[4068.50 --> 4074.98]  And so, these messages are coming at every turn.
[4075.12 --> 4080.50]  Our access to bad content, and we could define bad in a variety of ways,
[4080.60 --> 4083.94]  to downright evil things we shouldn't do and just things that are maybe less bad.
[4084.56 --> 4088.04]  But our access to bad content is unlimited.
[4088.84 --> 4090.88]  So, we're not that different from the Colossian church.
[4090.98 --> 4096.26]  We too, like them, have to resist worldly and cultural pressures at every turn.
[4096.26 --> 4099.78]  And this is not a small thing to do.
[4100.04 --> 4103.10]  Maybe some of you have experienced this where you wake up in the morning,
[4103.24 --> 4107.54]  and you look at your phone, and you see the Bible app notification for the verse of the day,
[4107.58 --> 4108.44]  and you go to open it.
[4108.48 --> 4111.72]  But before you open it, another notification pops up that you click on.
[4112.10 --> 4116.24]  And before you know it, you've not read your Bible verse of the day
[4116.24 --> 4117.68]  because you saw that it was in Leviticus,
[4117.80 --> 4120.32]  and you didn't really want to deal with Leviticus at 6 o'clock in the morning.
[4122.62 --> 4123.78]  But we end up wayward.
[4123.78 --> 4127.48]  But our fingers lead us astray on our smartphones all the time or on our computers.
[4129.24 --> 4130.28]  This is not so different.
[4130.82 --> 4133.02]  The Colossians are not so different from our modern context.
[4133.64 --> 4136.78]  The Western world now, depending on who you listen to,
[4136.86 --> 4139.30]  is going into a post- or anti-Christian state.
[4139.56 --> 4144.56]  And while we might remember or we can think about romantically
[4144.56 --> 4149.48]  this idea of a general Christian ethic in the world where things are safe for our children,
[4150.06 --> 4151.20]  the world's not quite the same.
[4151.20 --> 4154.90]  When I was a kid, if it said rated PG, it was fine to watch.
[4154.94 --> 4158.06]  And now we might think of those things with a little more skepticism.
[4159.18 --> 4164.46]  Our children, we even as adults, engage in a catechesis of the world.
[4164.98 --> 4169.16]  And our use of the TV, internet, and iPhones allow that catechesis,
[4169.24 --> 4175.04]  that teaching to us, happen at a rate unrivaled by any previous era.
[4175.04 --> 4178.30]  It's almost enough to lose hope.
[4179.42 --> 4184.34]  It's enough to think that we cannot gain enough knowledge or truth
[4184.34 --> 4188.24]  or do enough good work to resist the world's temptations for ourselves
[4188.24 --> 4191.20]  or for our children or for our grandchildren.
[4192.74 --> 4198.12]  Indeed, you likely, like me, have seen relatives, neighbors, friends, siblings
[4198.12 --> 4203.34]  fall from a place of Christian understanding into a place of unbelief.
[4203.88 --> 4204.56]  It's tragic.
[4205.62 --> 4208.56]  We wonder, you might wonder where God is in all of this.
[4209.28 --> 4211.64]  Our life is so pressured by these other messages.
[4212.16 --> 4213.64]  We want to do better.
[4213.74 --> 4214.96]  We want to be better Christians.
[4215.08 --> 4217.52]  We want to grow in our knowledge and our affections of God.
[4217.66 --> 4221.18]  And yet, we don't seem to be able to do it.
[4221.18 --> 4226.78]  And God, through Paul, gives us hope.
[4227.36 --> 4231.22]  We are not left to increase in our Christian walk,
[4231.66 --> 4234.60]  to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord by ourselves.
[4235.30 --> 4237.84]  Rather, we are empowered to do it.
[4238.40 --> 4241.10]  We're empowered to walk with God through prayer,
[4241.96 --> 4243.96]  through the knowledge, and through the fact of salvation.
[4245.00 --> 4248.62]  Recall for a moment, the text of Focus this morning comes
[4248.62 --> 4251.42]  after Paul thanks the Colossians for their faith in Christ.
[4252.02 --> 4255.56]  When he says in verse 9 that he has not ceased to pray for them,
[4256.22 --> 4258.06]  this is not an empty promise.
[4258.74 --> 4261.18]  The earlier statement in verse 3 qualifies them.
[4261.94 --> 4264.12]  He even says something similar to the church in Philippi,
[4264.54 --> 4265.84]  but God has begun in them.
[4265.94 --> 4268.42]  He will continue to complete that work.
[4269.82 --> 4272.74]  I think of a quote from one of my favorite theologians, John Webster,
[4273.22 --> 4274.20]  who says,
[4274.20 --> 4276.60]  the ability to do these things,
[4276.70 --> 4279.40]  the ability to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord,
[4279.92 --> 4282.64]  is given to us by God the Spirit.
[4284.08 --> 4286.00]  We can hang our hats on that promise.
[4286.12 --> 4288.24]  Our job, as Christians,
[4288.38 --> 4291.46]  is just to cooperate with the work that God is already doing.
[4293.92 --> 4295.76]  Part of my studies at Calvin Seminary
[4295.76 --> 4298.82]  means I go to Grand Rapids once a semester,
[4299.30 --> 4300.54]  in October and in February.
[4300.54 --> 4302.16]  And while we're there,
[4302.26 --> 4305.56]  we often spend one evening as classmates and faculty in a pub
[4305.56 --> 4307.52]  and enjoying some good conversation,
[4307.66 --> 4308.92]  a lively conversation.
[4309.42 --> 4310.82]  You might imagine what would happen
[4310.82 --> 4314.60]  when seminary professors and seminary students get together.
[4315.02 --> 4316.72]  It doesn't always sound like a discussion,
[4316.82 --> 4317.76]  maybe more of an argument,
[4317.90 --> 4319.30]  but I assure you they are discussions.
[4321.10 --> 4323.20]  And there was a question that was tabled
[4323.20 --> 4326.22]  with our systematic theology professor, Dr. Vandenberg,
[4326.22 --> 4327.14]  saying,
[4327.80 --> 4328.94]  is sanctification,
[4329.80 --> 4330.92]  monergistic or synergistic,
[4331.00 --> 4331.28]  big words,
[4331.34 --> 4332.04]  don't worry about it,
[4332.82 --> 4333.48]  is sanctification,
[4333.58 --> 4334.46]  the work of God
[4334.46 --> 4336.72]  growing us to be more like Christ,
[4336.80 --> 4338.98]  is that something that God does without us
[4338.98 --> 4340.74]  or something that we do with God?
[4342.22 --> 4343.44]  And it's something that we do with God.
[4343.56 --> 4344.74]  God is doing that work in us
[4344.74 --> 4347.24]  and we just cooperate with God in that work.
[4347.78 --> 4348.48]  So our job,
[4348.56 --> 4350.92]  when we think of our walk with Christ,
[4350.92 --> 4354.08]  is not to retreat from God
[4354.08 --> 4356.70]  and just pull ourselves up by our bootstraps
[4356.70 --> 4358.92]  and try to read our Bible more
[4358.92 --> 4360.66]  and get more involved in church
[4360.66 --> 4362.94]  and just do these things from our own sheer will,
[4363.40 --> 4365.82]  but rather our job is to surrender
[4365.82 --> 4368.84]  to the work that God is already doing in our life
[4368.84 --> 4370.18]  and run to Him,
[4371.32 --> 4373.48]  to have a posture of receipt from Him.
[4374.50 --> 4375.68]  We don't need to think,
[4375.76 --> 4378.30]  we shouldn't think that we need to get our lives in order
[4378.30 --> 4380.52]  before we can go be better Christians.
[4381.14 --> 4383.22]  In fact, we need to realize that we're a mess
[4383.22 --> 4384.92]  and we need to run to Christ
[4384.92 --> 4387.44]  and He will do that work with us.
[4389.48 --> 4391.10]  And so when it comes to Paul saying,
[4391.28 --> 4392.20]  I will pray for you
[4392.20 --> 4393.74]  and I won't cease to pray for you,
[4394.32 --> 4395.56]  this is not an empty promise.
[4395.74 --> 4397.38]  This is the work that God is doing
[4397.38 --> 4399.34]  in the church at Colossae
[4399.34 --> 4401.48]  and indeed the work that God is doing
[4401.48 --> 4402.50]  in our own lives,
[4402.72 --> 4403.56]  in your lives,
[4403.62 --> 4405.20]  in the life of this church.
[4405.20 --> 4408.36]  It's not just a simple statement about prayer
[4408.36 --> 4410.60]  and the promise that God hears our prayer.
[4411.58 --> 4413.62]  Paul is doing a more significant work
[4413.62 --> 4416.04]  in the text to tell the Christians in Colossae
[4416.04 --> 4418.80]  that God is at work among them
[4418.80 --> 4421.24]  and so they can know that the Spirit
[4421.24 --> 4424.32]  empowers them to continue walking with God.
[4425.12 --> 4425.82]  Paul doesn't say,
[4426.18 --> 4427.18]  go do these things more,
[4427.64 --> 4428.14]  have fun,
[4428.32 --> 4428.94]  you're on your own.
[4429.04 --> 4429.34]  He says,
[4429.40 --> 4429.54]  no,
[4429.62 --> 4430.40]  I will pray for you
[4430.40 --> 4432.58]  and God will do it with you.
[4432.58 --> 4437.20]  The second part of Paul's Thanksgiving section
[4437.20 --> 4438.88]  shares many parallels with the first.
[4439.00 --> 4440.72]  He's repeating a lot of these things
[4440.72 --> 4442.88]  and this connects with the earlier section
[4442.88 --> 4444.96]  that encourages the Colossians
[4444.96 --> 4446.90]  to continue in these various ways
[4446.90 --> 4447.70]  of Christian living.
[4448.58 --> 4448.92]  Furthermore,
[4449.16 --> 4450.88]  Paul's emphasis on empowerment
[4450.88 --> 4453.10]  in these expectations of Christian living
[4453.10 --> 4454.44]  comes from verse 9
[4454.44 --> 4455.80]  when he says,
[4455.80 --> 4457.48]  that you may be filled
[4457.48 --> 4458.92]  with the knowledge of His will
[4458.92 --> 4460.88]  in all spiritual wisdom and understanding.
[4460.88 --> 4463.60]  What does it mean to be filled with knowledge?
[4464.04 --> 4465.36]  I mentioned just a moment ago,
[4465.42 --> 4466.38]  it's not about just
[4466.38 --> 4468.46]  out of our own sheer will and determination
[4468.46 --> 4470.24]  to open up our Bibles more often.
[4471.44 --> 4474.30]  Rather, it's a surrender to God
[4474.30 --> 4477.76]  because the way that Paul writes this
[4477.76 --> 4479.42]  is that somebody else
[4479.42 --> 4480.56]  needs to be doing the filling.
[4481.70 --> 4483.04]  We are the passive recipients
[4483.04 --> 4485.10]  of God filling us with His knowledge.
[4486.80 --> 4487.58]  And we might think,
[4487.66 --> 4488.32]  well, how does that work?
[4488.38 --> 4489.94]  How does God fill us with knowledge?
[4489.94 --> 4491.54]  One way,
[4491.86 --> 4493.78]  Belgic Confession Article 2 says
[4493.78 --> 4495.98]  that God makes Himself known to us
[4495.98 --> 4497.82]  more clearly by His holy and divine Word
[4497.82 --> 4499.68]  as much as we need in this life
[4499.68 --> 4501.24]  for God's glory and for our salvation.
[4501.80 --> 4504.04]  So yes, there is practical elements
[4504.04 --> 4505.48]  to our Christian living
[4505.48 --> 4507.52]  where we should be more diligent
[4507.52 --> 4508.92]  in our discipleship
[4508.92 --> 4509.84]  and in our Bible reading
[4509.84 --> 4510.62]  and our church attendance
[4510.62 --> 4512.96]  and going to Bible studies and so on.
[4513.00 --> 4513.82]  The life of the church
[4513.82 --> 4516.50]  is critically important in this way.
[4516.50 --> 4519.54]  But recall that this is not exactly
[4519.54 --> 4520.82]  our own sheer will and determination.
[4520.96 --> 4522.08]  It's a matter of surrendering
[4522.08 --> 4522.96]  to the work of God
[4522.96 --> 4524.06]  in our lives already
[4524.06 --> 4525.94]  and have that posture
[4525.94 --> 4527.66]  of receiving from God.
[4529.26 --> 4530.88]  Congregation, this is a great hope
[4530.88 --> 4532.50]  and comfort for the Colossian church
[4532.50 --> 4534.04]  and indeed a great hope
[4534.04 --> 4535.58]  and comfort for us today
[4535.58 --> 4538.98]  because God is at work in His church
[4538.98 --> 4540.88]  and He will continue
[4540.88 --> 4542.04]  to help us grow
[4542.04 --> 4544.14]  more and more like Christ.
[4544.14 --> 4546.64]  So hopefully at this point
[4546.64 --> 4547.84]  you're feeling maybe
[4547.84 --> 4549.06]  like the Colossians felt.
[4549.62 --> 4550.60]  Saying, yeah, I'm encouraged.
[4550.74 --> 4551.90]  I'm feeling encouraged to do this
[4551.90 --> 4553.06]  and I'm feeling empowered.
[4553.50 --> 4555.56]  But sometimes that's not enough
[4555.56 --> 4556.66]  because we could wake up
[4556.66 --> 4557.14]  in the morning
[4557.14 --> 4558.80]  and we can walk out that door.
[4558.90 --> 4559.44]  We could walk out
[4559.44 --> 4560.42]  of the sanctuary today
[4560.42 --> 4563.36]  with all sorts of gumption
[4563.36 --> 4564.50]  ready to do it.
[4564.60 --> 4566.20]  But then as soon as something
[4566.20 --> 4566.82]  comes our way
[4566.82 --> 4568.28]  we lose all of that courage
[4568.28 --> 4569.56]  and we shrink back
[4569.56 --> 4571.50]  to our old sinful selves
[4571.50 --> 4572.42]  that is kind of the way
[4572.42 --> 4573.18]  we're used to being.
[4573.18 --> 4575.36]  And so Paul doesn't leave them
[4575.36 --> 4576.46]  with just encouragement
[4576.46 --> 4578.22]  and empowerment.
[4578.68 --> 4579.82]  He also encourages them
[4579.82 --> 4581.34]  to be bold in their faith.
[4582.56 --> 4583.84]  There's a reason why Paul
[4583.84 --> 4584.78]  structures this section
[4584.78 --> 4585.84]  of Scripture in this way.
[4586.16 --> 4587.74]  He knows that there will be trials.
[4588.22 --> 4588.30]  Right?
[4588.36 --> 4589.30]  The Colossian church
[4589.30 --> 4591.92]  faces all sorts of pressures
[4591.92 --> 4593.44]  against their way of life
[4593.44 --> 4594.58]  and their worldview
[4594.58 --> 4596.18]  very much like ours.
[4597.18 --> 4599.12]  There are constant worldly pressures
[4599.12 --> 4600.98]  that cause us to doubt our faith
[4600.98 --> 4602.96]  or to stray from the path
[4602.96 --> 4605.60]  and there's more existential threats.
[4605.84 --> 4606.20]  What do we do
[4606.20 --> 4607.54]  with our own questions of doubt?
[4608.24 --> 4608.86]  What do we do
[4608.86 --> 4609.66]  when we see God
[4609.66 --> 4610.68]  acting in the world
[4610.68 --> 4613.18]  in ways that don't make sense to us?
[4614.02 --> 4615.00]  When we hear about
[4615.00 --> 4615.84]  brothers and sisters
[4615.84 --> 4617.32]  who are suffering terribly
[4617.32 --> 4619.08]  because of illness
[4619.08 --> 4619.94]  or disability
[4619.94 --> 4621.46]  or mental health
[4621.46 --> 4622.48]  and we don't think
[4622.48 --> 4624.04]  we don't seem to find an answer
[4624.04 --> 4625.04]  as to why God
[4625.04 --> 4626.64]  is allowing that to happen.
[4626.64 --> 4628.92]  When it seems like
[4628.92 --> 4631.26]  our own battle against sin
[4631.26 --> 4631.88]  in our lives
[4631.88 --> 4632.66]  is futile.
[4633.34 --> 4634.08]  You've been struggling
[4634.08 --> 4635.48]  with the specific sin
[4635.48 --> 4636.54]  in your life for years
[4636.54 --> 4637.30]  decades
[4637.30 --> 4638.70]  and it does not go away.
[4640.76 --> 4641.74]  What do we do?
[4642.72 --> 4644.54]  God has a reminder for us.
[4645.68 --> 4646.56]  Paul reminded
[4646.56 --> 4647.86]  the Colossians
[4647.86 --> 4648.74]  of a simple fact
[4648.74 --> 4649.74]  that we cannot deny
[4649.74 --> 4650.82]  when we look
[4650.82 --> 4652.06]  at the work of Christ
[4652.06 --> 4653.36]  as summarized
[4653.36 --> 4654.80]  in verses 13 and 14
[4654.80 --> 4656.18]  when he says
[4656.18 --> 4657.68]  that He has transferred us
[4657.68 --> 4659.10]  from the domain of darkness
[4659.10 --> 4659.88]  and into the kingdom
[4659.88 --> 4661.22]  of His beloved Son.
[4662.26 --> 4663.64]  Paul's using language
[4663.64 --> 4666.64]  similar to Exodus chapter 6
[4666.64 --> 4667.88]  when Paul says
[4667.88 --> 4669.18]  that God has delivered us,
[4669.24 --> 4670.10]  He's transferred us,
[4670.14 --> 4671.04]  He's redeemed us,
[4671.44 --> 4672.54]  He's forgiven us.
[4673.06 --> 4674.06]  This is the same motif
[4674.06 --> 4674.68]  that he's drawing
[4674.68 --> 4675.32]  out of the Israelites
[4675.32 --> 4676.30]  coming out of Egypt
[4676.30 --> 4678.36]  and into what eventually
[4678.36 --> 4679.58]  will be the promised land.
[4680.24 --> 4681.36]  And so we can easily
[4681.36 --> 4682.34]  see these connections.
[4682.34 --> 4685.06]  Paul makes this statement
[4685.06 --> 4685.78]  with this allusion
[4685.78 --> 4687.36]  because it reminds us
[4687.36 --> 4688.56]  of God's handiwork,
[4688.76 --> 4689.52]  God's victory,
[4689.74 --> 4692.16]  God's reigning over His world.
[4693.54 --> 4694.14]  These would have been
[4694.14 --> 4695.08]  familiar stories
[4695.08 --> 4695.92]  to Jewish,
[4696.14 --> 4697.04]  former Jewish Christians
[4697.04 --> 4698.46]  and they know
[4698.46 --> 4699.32]  these stories well
[4699.32 --> 4700.40]  just like many of us
[4700.40 --> 4700.98]  know the story
[4700.98 --> 4702.52]  of the Exodus well.
[4703.14 --> 4703.52]  And we know
[4703.52 --> 4704.40]  that there's many layers
[4704.40 --> 4705.08]  of significance
[4705.08 --> 4705.76]  and meaning
[4705.76 --> 4707.50]  to the story of Exodus
[4707.50 --> 4708.54]  but we also know
[4708.54 --> 4709.64]  that it is simply
[4709.64 --> 4710.64]  a historical fact
[4710.64 --> 4712.36]  that God rescued
[4712.36 --> 4714.38]  His people from Egypt.
[4715.60 --> 4716.46]  But to kind of illustrate
[4716.46 --> 4717.36]  this idea of being
[4717.36 --> 4718.56]  emboldened by the work
[4718.56 --> 4718.92]  of God,
[4719.02 --> 4720.08]  let me draw out
[4720.08 --> 4721.78]  a little motif
[4721.78 --> 4722.92]  from the later chapters
[4722.92 --> 4723.36]  of Exodus.
[4724.44 --> 4724.74]  The Israelites
[4724.74 --> 4725.58]  come out of Egypt,
[4725.88 --> 4727.08]  they go to Mount Sinai
[4727.08 --> 4728.12]  and Moses ascends
[4728.12 --> 4728.60]  to the top
[4728.60 --> 4729.94]  to receive the tablets
[4729.94 --> 4730.48]  of the law
[4730.48 --> 4731.82]  and in Exodus 32
[4731.82 --> 4732.78]  he descends
[4732.78 --> 4733.44]  from the mountain.
[4734.40 --> 4735.64]  These rescued people
[4735.64 --> 4736.84]  from slavery
[4736.84 --> 4737.90]  and what does
[4737.90 --> 4738.94]  He find them doing?
[4739.66 --> 4740.10]  Worshipping
[4740.10 --> 4741.94]  the golden calf.
[4742.96 --> 4743.82]  Worldly pressures
[4743.82 --> 4744.50]  got to them
[4744.50 --> 4746.06]  and they succumbed.
[4746.94 --> 4747.48]  Aaron offers
[4747.48 --> 4748.16]  some excuses
[4748.16 --> 4749.28]  and Moses is angry.
[4750.60 --> 4752.26]  But in Exodus 35
[4752.26 --> 4755.22]  Moses starts teaching
[4755.22 --> 4755.98]  about how God
[4755.98 --> 4756.54]  wants them to build
[4756.54 --> 4757.22]  their tabernacle
[4757.22 --> 4758.22]  and He puts a call
[4758.22 --> 4758.82]  to them
[4758.82 --> 4761.08]  to donate
[4761.08 --> 4761.84]  their riches
[4761.84 --> 4763.26]  to build
[4763.26 --> 4764.06]  the tabernacle.
[4764.14 --> 4764.44]  Now remember
[4764.44 --> 4765.42]  they had donated already
[4765.42 --> 4765.96]  a whole bunch
[4765.96 --> 4766.46]  of their plunder
[4766.46 --> 4767.04]  from the Egyptians
[4767.04 --> 4767.42]  to build
[4767.42 --> 4768.18]  the golden calf
[4768.18 --> 4769.72]  and Moses ground it up,
[4769.78 --> 4770.14]  put it in the water
[4770.14 --> 4770.56]  and they drank
[4770.56 --> 4771.36]  and he wasted it
[4771.36 --> 4772.30]  but they still have
[4772.30 --> 4774.14]  more to give.
[4775.56 --> 4776.32]  And so the Israelites
[4776.32 --> 4777.12]  donate their plunder,
[4777.24 --> 4777.94]  God calls them
[4777.94 --> 4778.46]  into worship,
[4778.68 --> 4779.48]  Moses teaches them
[4779.48 --> 4780.18]  about the law
[4780.18 --> 4782.08]  and says this is
[4782.08 --> 4783.08]  how you can respond
[4783.08 --> 4784.38]  is by giving your gifts
[4784.38 --> 4785.34]  to build the tabernacle
[4785.34 --> 4786.24]  and they do.
[4787.14 --> 4787.84]  And while the Israelites
[4787.84 --> 4788.74]  are not always
[4788.74 --> 4789.74]  the best examples
[4789.74 --> 4790.92]  of the Christian life,
[4791.92 --> 4792.68]  in this case
[4792.68 --> 4793.34]  this is a moment
[4793.34 --> 4793.80]  where they were
[4793.80 --> 4794.86]  emboldened by
[4794.86 --> 4795.80]  their faith
[4795.80 --> 4796.60]  in God
[4796.60 --> 4797.36]  to trust
[4797.36 --> 4798.54]  in God
[4798.54 --> 4800.20]  and that in many
[4800.20 --> 4800.82]  circumstances
[4800.82 --> 4801.56]  God would never
[4801.56 --> 4802.20]  forsake them,
[4802.56 --> 4803.52]  never abandon them
[4803.52 --> 4804.60]  and that He will
[4804.60 --> 4805.18]  always seek
[4805.18 --> 4806.10]  to embolden them
[4806.10 --> 4806.90]  in their faith.
[4807.62 --> 4808.88]  Paul is calling us
[4808.88 --> 4809.72]  to be emboldened
[4809.72 --> 4811.66]  not because we have
[4811.66 --> 4812.26]  the sheer will
[4812.26 --> 4812.88]  and determination
[4812.88 --> 4813.52]  the ability
[4813.52 --> 4814.12]  to be bold
[4814.12 --> 4814.68]  in our faith
[4814.68 --> 4816.18]  but because God
[4816.18 --> 4817.54]  has already done
[4817.54 --> 4818.20]  that work
[4818.20 --> 4819.28]  and we can just
[4819.28 --> 4820.42]  boast in that work
[4820.42 --> 4820.82]  that God
[4820.82 --> 4821.50]  has already done.
[4821.88 --> 4822.58]  He has already
[4822.58 --> 4823.42]  transferred you
[4823.42 --> 4824.10]  from the kingdom
[4824.10 --> 4824.64]  of darkness
[4824.64 --> 4825.82]  into the kingdom
[4825.82 --> 4827.50]  of His beloved Son.
[4828.22 --> 4829.10]  So to be emboldened
[4829.10 --> 4830.26]  is to live by faith,
[4830.62 --> 4831.90]  to live with a trust
[4831.90 --> 4832.52]  in God
[4832.52 --> 4834.36]  and so we ought not
[4834.36 --> 4836.14]  fear the world
[4836.14 --> 4837.98]  but be bold
[4837.98 --> 4838.96]  in our faith.
[4840.46 --> 4841.58]  God has not
[4841.58 --> 4842.86]  abandoned you
[4842.86 --> 4844.38]  to try and live
[4844.38 --> 4845.46]  a godly life alone.
[4845.52 --> 4846.70]  He does not call you
[4846.70 --> 4847.72]  into relationship
[4847.72 --> 4848.28]  with Him
[4848.28 --> 4849.12]  and then say
[4849.12 --> 4849.82]  here's my Bible
[4849.82 --> 4850.42]  off you run
[4850.42 --> 4851.16]  have a good time
[4851.16 --> 4852.06]  figure it out
[4852.06 --> 4852.52]  on your own.
[4853.80 --> 4854.92]  He doesn't leave you
[4854.92 --> 4856.26]  without hope
[4856.26 --> 4858.14]  even though He knows
[4858.14 --> 4859.08]  that you will face
[4859.08 --> 4859.90]  many trials
[4859.90 --> 4861.84]  and exist in a world
[4861.84 --> 4862.74]  that does not look
[4862.74 --> 4863.48]  favorably
[4863.48 --> 4864.74]  on Christianity
[4864.74 --> 4866.50]  but we can find
[4866.50 --> 4867.34]  hope and comfort
[4867.34 --> 4868.14]  in a God
[4868.14 --> 4869.22]  who ministers
[4869.22 --> 4869.92]  to us
[4869.92 --> 4870.80]  in those moments
[4870.80 --> 4871.48]  of fear,
[4872.30 --> 4872.64]  doubt,
[4873.20 --> 4874.00]  and despair.
[4875.26 --> 4876.10]  In closing,
[4876.32 --> 4877.10]  think of it this way.
[4877.72 --> 4878.76]  Paul writes this letter
[4878.76 --> 4879.28]  to the church
[4879.28 --> 4879.84]  in Colossae
[4879.84 --> 4882.24]  while he is in prison.
[4883.18 --> 4883.96]  We might have
[4883.96 --> 4884.94]  a romantic view
[4884.94 --> 4886.92]  of first century prisons
[4886.92 --> 4888.20]  from our children's Bibles
[4888.20 --> 4889.86]  where there's big smiles
[4889.86 --> 4890.68]  on their faces
[4890.68 --> 4892.20]  and it looks all wonderful
[4892.20 --> 4893.04]  and maybe there's a plate
[4893.04 --> 4894.32]  of bread for them
[4894.32 --> 4895.58]  but we should probably
[4895.58 --> 4896.26]  get rid of those.
[4896.80 --> 4897.56]  First century prisons
[4897.56 --> 4898.74]  were one of the worst places
[4898.74 --> 4899.90]  you could ever possibly
[4899.90 --> 4900.98]  find yourself.
[4901.12 --> 4901.88]  Dark, dingy,
[4902.34 --> 4902.92]  disease-ridden,
[4903.06 --> 4903.60]  infested,
[4904.24 --> 4905.70]  disgusting places.
[4906.60 --> 4907.68]  Maybe the closest place
[4907.68 --> 4908.40]  that you might think
[4908.40 --> 4909.30]  you could find hell
[4909.30 --> 4909.80]  on earth.
[4911.02 --> 4911.90]  But what is the tone
[4911.90 --> 4912.66]  of Paul's letter?
[4914.10 --> 4915.50]  Does Paul let that
[4915.50 --> 4916.84]  dark, dingy,
[4917.10 --> 4918.26]  despairing attitude
[4918.26 --> 4918.92]  around him
[4918.92 --> 4920.18]  seep into his
[4920.18 --> 4921.08]  letter writing?
[4922.20 --> 4922.94]  No, his tone
[4922.94 --> 4923.70]  of letter writing
[4923.70 --> 4924.74]  is thanksgiving
[4924.74 --> 4925.44]  and gratitude
[4925.44 --> 4926.56]  for what God
[4926.56 --> 4927.26]  has done
[4927.26 --> 4927.66]  in the church
[4927.66 --> 4928.28]  of Colossae
[4928.28 --> 4929.48]  and will continue
[4929.48 --> 4929.96]  to do
[4929.96 --> 4930.56]  in the church
[4930.56 --> 4931.66]  of Colossae.
[4932.62 --> 4933.64]  Paul hearkens back
[4933.64 --> 4934.56]  to the Exodus story
[4934.56 --> 4935.56]  as an encouragement
[4935.56 --> 4936.94]  for the salvation
[4936.94 --> 4937.72]  that is secured
[4937.72 --> 4938.74]  in Christ.
[4939.60 --> 4940.06]  And we,
[4940.28 --> 4941.04]  as Christians today,
[4941.54 --> 4942.32]  we can be reminded
[4942.32 --> 4943.00]  of that moment
[4943.00 --> 4944.16]  of Exodus.
[4944.30 --> 4945.02]  We can be reminded
[4945.02 --> 4945.58]  of this moment
[4945.58 --> 4945.96]  in the church
[4945.96 --> 4946.64]  of Colossae
[4946.64 --> 4947.74]  where God
[4947.74 --> 4948.76]  was at work
[4948.76 --> 4949.86]  through Paul
[4949.86 --> 4950.34]  to them
[4950.34 --> 4951.62]  and be reminded
[4951.62 --> 4952.38]  that God
[4952.38 --> 4953.28]  is indeed
[4953.28 --> 4954.46]  at work today
[4954.46 --> 4955.58]  in the midst
[4955.58 --> 4956.28]  of this church
[4956.28 --> 4956.86]  as well,
[4956.90 --> 4957.20]  in the midst
[4957.20 --> 4958.04]  of your life.
[4958.76 --> 4959.46]  So people of God,
[4959.54 --> 4960.54]  it is our joy,
[4961.46 --> 4962.08]  it is our joy
[4962.08 --> 4962.68]  to walk
[4962.68 --> 4963.70]  in a manner
[4963.70 --> 4965.34]  pleasing to God.
[4967.96 --> 4968.80]  It's our joy
[4968.80 --> 4969.56]  to walk that way.
[4969.68 --> 4970.94]  It's a gracious response
[4970.94 --> 4972.20]  to the completed work
[4972.20 --> 4973.20]  of Christ
[4973.20 --> 4974.46]  which was done
[4974.46 --> 4975.30]  for our salvation.
[4975.46 --> 4976.32]  We have the pleasure
[4976.32 --> 4977.56]  of living
[4977.56 --> 4978.30]  to bear fruit,
[4978.40 --> 4978.96]  to grow empowered
[4978.96 --> 4979.70]  and to give thanks
[4979.70 --> 4980.52]  because God
[4980.52 --> 4981.74]  is doing it with us.
[4982.12 --> 4983.96]  This is a relational task.
[4984.06 --> 4984.74]  We're not doing it
[4984.74 --> 4985.34]  on our own.
[4986.42 --> 4987.36]  God will increase
[4987.36 --> 4988.18]  this in us
[4988.18 --> 4989.56]  and we will bear
[4989.56 --> 4990.52]  the fruit of the Spirit.
[4991.26 --> 4991.90]  We will grow
[4991.90 --> 4992.72]  in our knowledge
[4992.72 --> 4993.54]  and love of Christ
[4993.54 --> 4994.82]  and we will be empowered
[4994.82 --> 4996.32]  by God the Spirit
[4996.32 --> 4996.98]  to live
[4996.98 --> 4998.28]  in a godly manner
[4998.28 --> 4999.52]  that harbors
[4999.52 --> 5000.46]  the spirit of gratitude.
[5001.68 --> 5002.70]  Brothers and sisters,
[5003.66 --> 5004.88]  God is at work
[5004.88 --> 5005.58]  among us.
[5005.80 --> 5006.38]  He's at work
[5006.38 --> 5007.38]  in you
[5007.38 --> 5008.18]  encouraging,
[5008.96 --> 5009.42]  empowering,
[5010.10 --> 5011.14]  and emboldening you
[5011.14 --> 5011.82]  to walk
[5011.82 --> 5013.04]  the walk of faith
[5013.04 --> 5014.38]  in Jesus Christ.
[5015.00 --> 5015.36]  Amen.
[5016.04 --> 5016.70]  Let me pray.
[5018.56 --> 5019.40]  Father in heaven,
[5019.48 --> 5020.16]  we thank you
[5020.16 --> 5021.24]  for your word
[5021.24 --> 5021.80]  to us today.
[5022.66 --> 5023.30]  We marvel
[5023.30 --> 5024.64]  at the way
[5024.64 --> 5026.60]  that these events
[5026.60 --> 5028.22]  happened so many years ago.
[5028.58 --> 5029.26]  Paul in prison,
[5029.38 --> 5030.20]  writing to a church
[5030.20 --> 5030.88]  in Colossae
[5030.88 --> 5032.60]  and that these documents
[5032.60 --> 5033.50]  were saved
[5033.50 --> 5034.86]  and preserved
[5034.86 --> 5035.84]  for our benefit today
[5035.84 --> 5036.44]  and that you
[5036.44 --> 5037.76]  are at work in them.
[5038.68 --> 5038.88]  So Lord,
[5038.92 --> 5039.66]  I pray that you would
[5039.66 --> 5041.02]  continue this work
[5041.02 --> 5041.68]  in our lives,
[5042.28 --> 5042.68]  that you would
[5042.68 --> 5043.50]  encourage us,
[5043.68 --> 5044.22]  empower us,
[5044.24 --> 5045.00]  and embolden us
[5045.00 --> 5046.14]  to be Christians
[5046.14 --> 5046.86]  as we go into
[5046.86 --> 5047.76]  our workplaces,
[5047.92 --> 5048.58]  into our communities,
[5048.72 --> 5049.54]  into our families.
[5049.54 --> 5050.84]  And Lord,
[5050.90 --> 5051.48]  that your kingdom
[5051.48 --> 5052.64]  would come
[5052.64 --> 5053.32]  and the people
[5053.32 --> 5053.74]  around us
[5053.74 --> 5054.48]  would see a glimpse
[5054.48 --> 5055.14]  of your goodness.
[5055.80 --> 5056.26]  We pray this
[5056.26 --> 5056.70]  in your name.
[5056.96 --> 5057.20]  Amen.
[5059.70 --> 5060.62]  I think we'll stand
[5060.62 --> 5061.10]  and sing
[5061.10 --> 5062.16]  one more song
[5062.16 --> 5063.00]  or two more songs.
[5063.90 --> 5064.90]  One of my favorite songs
[5064.90 --> 5065.44]  we'll sing is
[5065.44 --> 5066.28]  Yet Not I,
[5066.34 --> 5067.26]  But Through Christ and Me.
[5067.84 --> 5068.48]  A good reminder
[5068.48 --> 5070.96]  that the great hymn writers
[5070.96 --> 5071.60]  aren't all dead.
[5071.68 --> 5072.08]  There are still
[5072.08 --> 5072.72]  great hymn writers
[5072.72 --> 5073.28]  alive today
[5073.28 --> 5074.00]  writing good,
[5074.38 --> 5074.92]  biblical hymns
[5074.92 --> 5075.62]  that we get to sing.
[5075.62 --> 5075.72]  Amen.
[5075.72 --> 5075.92]  Amen.
[5104.92 --> 5107.00]  Grace is Jesus,
[5107.24 --> 5109.10]  my Redeemer.
[5109.96 --> 5112.38]  There is no more
[5112.38 --> 5115.82]  for heaven now to give.
[5116.54 --> 5118.90]  He is my joy,
[5119.08 --> 5120.24]  my righteousness,
[5120.24 --> 5122.08]  and freedom,
[5123.14 --> 5125.52]  my steadfast love,
[5125.64 --> 5129.24]  my deep and boundless kiss.
[5129.24 --> 5132.14]  To this I hope,
[5132.24 --> 5135.24]  my hope is only Jesus,
[5136.56 --> 5142.36]  for my life is wholly bound to His.
[5143.04 --> 5146.04]  Oh, how strange and divine
[5146.04 --> 5147.86]  I can see,
[5148.16 --> 5149.80]  all is mine,
[5149.90 --> 5151.36]  yet not I,
[5151.56 --> 5154.56]  but through Christ in me.
[5159.24 --> 5171.20]  The night is dark,
[5171.20 --> 5174.20]  but I am not forsaken,
[5175.20 --> 5177.66]  for by my side
[5177.66 --> 5180.98]  the Savior He will stay.
[5181.74 --> 5185.26]  I labor on in weakness
[5185.26 --> 5187.50]  and rejoicing,
[5187.50 --> 5190.38]  for in my need
[5190.38 --> 5193.46]  His power is displayed.
[5194.82 --> 5196.46]  To this I hope,
[5197.32 --> 5200.46]  my shepherd will defend me,
[5201.46 --> 5204.74]  through the deepest valley
[5204.74 --> 5207.04]  He will lead.
[5208.14 --> 5211.16]  Oh, the night has been won,
[5211.42 --> 5214.00]  and I shall overcome,
[5214.00 --> 5215.68]  long yet not I,
[5215.68 --> 5220.74]  but through Christ in me.
[5232.62 --> 5235.28]  No fate I dread,
[5235.96 --> 5238.38]  I know I am forgiven,
[5238.38 --> 5245.38]  The future's sure, the price it has been paid
[5246.06 --> 5252.04]  For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon
[5252.04 --> 5258.38]  And he was raised to overthrow the grave
[5258.38 --> 5264.38]  To this I hold, my sin has been forgiven
[5264.38 --> 5271.38]  Jesus now and ever is my plea
[5271.38 --> 5278.38]  Oh, the chains are released, I can sing, I am free
[5278.38 --> 5284.38]  Yet not I, come through Christ with me
[5294.38 --> 5303.38]  With every breath I long to follow Jesus
[5303.38 --> 5310.38]  For he has said that he will bring me home
[5310.38 --> 5317.38]  And day by day I know he will renew me
[5317.38 --> 5323.38]  Until I stand with joy before the throne
[5323.38 --> 5330.38]  To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus
[5330.38 --> 5336.38]  All the glory evermore to him
[5336.38 --> 5343.38]  When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat
[5343.38 --> 5350.38]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me
[5350.38 --> 5356.38]  When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat
[5356.38 --> 5362.38]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me
[5362.38 --> 5370.38]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me
[5370.38 --> 5380.88]  People of God, God has called us into worship this morning
[5380.88 --> 5384.32]  We've been reconciled to him through confession
[5384.32 --> 5386.48]  And through the victorious death of Christ
[5386.48 --> 5389.30]  And he has fed us from his preached word
[5389.30 --> 5393.24]  Now, people of God, go from this place into the world
[5393.24 --> 5395.84]  Into your homes, workplaces, and neighborhoods
[5395.84 --> 5399.52]  With this blessing from God's word in Romans chapter 15
[5399.52 --> 5403.12]  May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace
[5403.12 --> 5404.42]  As you trust in him
[5404.42 --> 5407.00]  So that you may overflow with hope
[5407.00 --> 5409.26]  By the power of the Holy Spirit
[5409.26 --> 5410.12]  Amen
[5410.46 --> 5414.82]  Amen
[5414.82 --> 5418.44]  The tomb of my holy Spirit
[5418.44 --> 5441.88]  It's my only comfort in my life and in my death
[5441.88 --> 5447.72]  You have fully paid for all my sins and all my men
[5447.72 --> 5451.72]  Even when I struggle to believe
[5451.72 --> 5457.16]  With your precious blood you set me free
[5457.16 --> 5468.36]  I am not my own, but give up body and soul
[5468.36 --> 5474.08]  In my life and in death
[5474.08 --> 5480.72]  To you, Lord Christ my Lord
[5480.72 --> 5486.08]  You've reserved my life in such a way that without you
[5486.08 --> 5491.76]  Not a hair can fall from me, I bless you with it too
[5491.76 --> 5495.76]  Even when I'm lost in desperation
[5495.76 --> 5502.08]  All things work together for my salvation
[5502.08 --> 5512.08]  I am not my own, but give up body and soul
[5512.08 --> 5518.08]  In my life and in death
[5518.08 --> 5524.72]  To you, Lord Christ my Lord
[5524.72 --> 5538.72]  Always by your holy spirit, you wish you were made
[5538.72 --> 5552.72]  Always by your holy spirit, you wish you were made
[5552.72 --> 5556.72]  Of eternal life and make me willing and ready
[5556.72 --> 5558.72]  Even when I'm lost in desperation
[5558.72 --> 5560.72]  Even when I'm lost in desperation
[5560.72 --> 5562.72]  Even when I'm lost in desperation
[5562.72 --> 5566.72]  I am not my own, but give up body and soul
[5566.72 --> 5578.72]  I am not my own, but give up body and soul
[5578.72 --> 5580.72]  In my life and in death
[5580.72 --> 5584.72]  In my life and in death
[5584.72 --> 5586.72]  In my life and in death
[5586.72 --> 5592.72]  To you, Lord Christ my Lord
[5592.72 --> 5598.72]  I am not my own, but give up body and soul
[5598.72 --> 5600.72]  In my life and death
[5600.72 --> 5604.72]  In my life and in death
[5604.72 --> 5606.72]  In my life and soul
[5606.72 --> 5610.72]  In my life and in death
[5610.72 --> 5613.92]  I am not my own, but give up body and soul
[5613.92 --> 5616.72]  In my life and in death
[5616.72 --> 5618.42]  In my life and death
[5618.72 --> 5620.72]  In my life and death
[5620.72 --> 5622.72]  Oh
[5650.72 --> 5652.72]  Oh
[5680.72 --> 5682.72]  Oh
[5710.72 --> 5712.72]  Oh

[5762.72 --> 5764.72]  Oh
[5764.72 --> 5767.00]  Eh
[5767.00 --> 5768.94]  Eh
[5770.14 --> 5770.56]  Oh
[5770.56 --> 5800.54]  Thank you.
[5800.56 --> 5830.54]  Thank you.
[5830.56 --> 5860.54]  Thank you.
[5860.56 --> 5890.54]  Thank you.
[5890.56 --> 5920.54]  Thank you.
[5920.56 --> 5950.54]  Thank you.
[5950.56 --> 5980.54]  Thank you.
[5980.56 --> 6010.54]  Thank you.
[6010.56 --> 6040.54]  Thank you.

[6100.56 --> 6130.54]  Thank you.
[6130.56 --> 6160.54]  Thank you.
