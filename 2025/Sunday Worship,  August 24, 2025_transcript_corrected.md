[3437.74 → 3438.74] Thank you.
[3438.74 → 3440.74] Thank you.
[3440.74 → 3444.64] We, on the other hand, are so limited in those attributes.
[3445.22 → 3448.46] We think we know everything and completely miss our own ignorance.
[3449.20 → 3453.68] We think we control everything, but our plans are just so easily blown off course.
[3454.70 → 3457.84] We think we can do all things, but we neglect your ways.
[3459.50 → 3463.20] We ask for your forgiveness for these wrongs.
[3464.10 → 3469.00] We pray that you reveal our shortcomings to us so that we may be cleansed from our wrongs.
[3469.00 → 3474.12] Reveal our wayward ways so we can follow yours with the Spirit's guidance.
[3475.52 → 3480.14] We regret the time that your name is tarnished as a result of our actions.
[3480.74 → 3485.22] Rather, we pray, God, that instead of people being turned off by Christians,
[3485.36 → 3487.58] that they may be attracted to you through us.
[3488.82 → 3493.74] Father, we pray for the many needs and things going on in our congregation.
[3493.74 → 3499.52] Father, we pray for John as he continues to navigate his health.
[3499.88 → 3503.46] We pray for Pastor Abolish anticipating the surgery.
[3503.68 → 3507.74] We pray that that blood sugar will get under control.
[3508.84 → 3514.10] Father, we pray, too, for Doug and his continuing battle with cancer.
[3515.08 → 3517.42] And we thank you for Ava and Lisa.
[3517.42 → 3523.54] We pray that you bless them, and we thank you for the blessing that they have already been to our congregation.
[3524.88 → 3529.34] And we think of those who are beginning a new phase in their life.
[3530.96 → 3540.48] We pray for Imani and Mania and Nathan and Allie McKinley, Maria, Joey, and Matthias.
[3540.48 → 3545.02] We pray that you bless them as they navigate a new season of life.
[3548.82 → 3552.98] Father, we thank you for the many blessings in our congregation.
[3553.56 → 3560.50] Thank you for the people who make up our church, your body, for the things that they do and the faith that they exemplify.
[3561.00 → 3565.36] Father, we thank you for the seniors, whether they are new to worshipping with us
[3565.36 → 3569.16] or perhaps even founding members of this congregation so many years ago.
[3569.16 → 3575.14] We cherish their presence, and we pray that they may continually remind us of your faithfulness.
[3576.28 → 3582.38] Thank you for those babies and toddlers bringing absolute delight, noise, and promise to us.
[3582.52 → 3585.48] Thank you for the blessings that they bring.
[3586.56 → 3590.80] Father, we thank you for the many ministries in our midst that support all the functions of our church.
[3591.46 → 3597.94] We think of those who are taking care of the reconstruction, and we pray that that will go well.
[3597.94 → 3605.10] And we thank you that things can extend beyond the walls of this congregation.
[3605.86 → 3611.82] We think of Tim and Charity Johnson and the work that they do, for Jody and Uriel and the work that they do.
[3612.48 → 3616.30] We pray, too, for the Reactivate conference that we're able to host.
[3616.30 → 3624.68] Lord, we pray that those plans and preparations will come together, and we pray for those leading it,
[3624.74 → 3629.00] that you will give them wisdom and eyes to see what you would have them do.
[3630.06 → 3635.76] We thank you for the work of the deacons as they reach out to people in the community, people in our congregation,
[3636.42 → 3638.14] things that we're not even aware of.
[3638.14 → 3647.14] Thank you for those who walk alongside someone who's in need, for those who do things like giving others a ride,
[3647.38 → 3654.02] for those who share a timely word of encouragement, and we have no idea how meaningful those words can be.
[3654.54 → 3659.62] We pray that you give us eyes to see those that we can support and the courage to speak.
[3659.62 → 3668.38] Thank you for your word that is faithfully preached, for the blessing of the preachers that we have here that challenge us with your word.
[3668.98 → 3672.16] Thank you for a big idea each and every Sunday.
[3673.50 → 3678.60] And thank you that we can take the time to pour over Matthew and for the passage today.
[3680.18 → 3687.84] We pray that through our worship today that we may sense that you are all-knowing, all-powerful, and present everywhere.
[3687.84 → 3693.84] Give us an eternal perspective and a hope that rests in you.
[3695.10 → 3699.16] O the depths of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God,
[3699.66 → 3704.04] for from him and through him and for him are all things.
[3704.84 → 3707.28] To him be the glory forever and ever.
[3707.82 → 3708.12] Amen.
[3708.12 → 3708.24] Amen.
[3717.84 → 3733.68] Rob just prayed a prayer of thanksgiving for preachers who challenge us.
[3734.54 → 3738.80] And so I'm grateful for that prayer, because today's text might be a challenge
[3738.80 → 3743.88] as we wrestle with what is happening in the Lord's Supper.
[3743.88 → 3753.54] If you're a guest with us, we have been this summer looking at Jesus as shown to us, revealed to us in the Gospel of Matthew.
[3754.12 → 3757.10] Our series has been titled, Behold Your King.
[3757.18 → 3765.14] And we've made our way taking snapshots that we might fix our eyes on the majesty of Jesus.
[3765.14 → 3770.20] We continue that series this morning in Matthew 26.
[3770.60 → 3776.42] And we're going to read verses 26 through 30 to the end there.
[3776.80 → 3779.38] The first time through, it will be on the screen behind me.
[3779.76 → 3782.90] But of course, I encourage you, if you have a Bible with you, open that up.
[3783.14 → 3784.06] Follow along there.
[3784.48 → 3786.90] Or turn on your Bible app.
[3787.02 → 3787.60] Open that up.
[3787.70 → 3788.46] Follow along there.
[3788.56 → 3791.58] Keep that in front of you as we go through this together.
[3791.58 → 3799.30] Let's read through Matthew 26, starting at verse 26.
[3801.94 → 3805.36] While they were eating, Jesus took bread.
[3805.78 → 3810.60] And when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying,
[3811.24 → 3812.66] Take and eat.
[3813.14 → 3814.86] This is my body.
[3814.86 → 3817.68] And then he took a cup.
[3817.98 → 3820.68] And when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying,
[3821.20 → 3822.90] Drink from it, all of you.
[3823.26 → 3829.94] This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
[3830.82 → 3841.50] I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.
[3841.50 → 3846.98] And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
[3847.62 → 3848.98] This is the word of the Lord.
[3854.40 → 3865.68] Have you ever had that feeling or that experience where you have sat down for an excellent meal, eaten and eaten and eaten,
[3865.68 → 3876.94] and then like 10 minutes later, you're starving again?
[3876.94 → 3887.26] My son, who never stops moving, has this every single night.
[3888.10 → 3893.54] He will eat his fill at a dinner, and then within half an hour, he's starving.
[3894.30 → 3895.76] And then we have to feed him again.
[3896.10 → 3899.84] And then five minutes before bed, he's starving one more time.
[3900.18 → 3901.00] We have to feed him again.
[3901.00 → 3907.22] But it's also not just in literal food, right?
[3907.36 → 3918.34] But metaphorically, maybe you are a parent who works late every night, every night, every night,
[3918.34 → 3922.22] only to find out that you're missing time with your kids.
[3922.22 → 3927.20] Or maybe you're endlessly scrolling social media.
[3928.38 → 3936.12] Someone will like back what you have liked or will leave a comment for you so that you finally feel seen.
[3936.42 → 3941.46] No matter how long, how many times you try, you just get missed.
[3942.14 → 3945.12] Or it feels like you are being missed.
[3945.12 → 3955.10] Perhaps it's in celebrating a big promotion to realize that this new thing doesn't fill that ache inside of you.
[3955.82 → 3965.50] We all know this kind of hunger, and we try to satiate snacks and with small victories that in the end never truly satisfied.
[3967.58 → 3973.48] When my kids were young, one of their favourite books was actually The Very Hungry Caterpillar.
[3973.56 → 3974.66] How many people know this book?
[3975.12 → 3976.40] All right.
[3977.18 → 3988.82] In the book, Caterpillar eats and eats and eats, and he eats fruit and chocolate cake and candies, and then eventually leaves,
[3988.90 → 3992.12] and he just keeps eating and eating and eating, and he isn't full.
[3992.46 → 4000.58] It's only at the end, when he gets the right food, at the right time, does he finally grow and transform.
[4000.58 → 4006.96] Now, the story is really simple, but it's an excellent mirror for us in our lives.
[4007.48 → 4012.52] All the temporary things that we try to feed on, all the junk food that we go after,
[4012.86 → 4018.92] leaves us empty until, at the right moment, true food is offered.
[4018.92 → 4023.18] This is the question for us this morning.
[4024.98 → 4032.88] How are we chasing things that we thought would satisfy, only to realize they're leaving us empty?
[4032.88 → 4039.28] Or what are the things that we try to fill our lives with that never truly satisfy?
[4039.28 → 4047.50] It could be that the hunger you feel is pointing you to something greater than what the world has to offer.
[4047.50 → 4055.62] My contention this morning is that when Jesus takes the bread and the bread at the last supper,
[4055.90 → 4063.50] he is offering something extraordinary, something we cannot manufacture on our own,
[4064.34 → 4071.86] but something that our bodies, our very souls, in fact, long for.
[4071.86 → 4083.32] The big idea this morning is that the hunger in every human heart can only be satisfied at the king's table,
[4083.92 → 4091.22] where Jesus offers himself in covenant fellowship as the true and better feast.
[4093.00 → 4099.40] The only way to satisfy that hunger is to come to Jesus.
[4101.86 → 4109.88] We read that Jesus, at this supper, takes bread, he blesses it, he breaks it,
[4109.94 → 4112.72] and he gives it to his disciples, saying,
[4112.92 → 4116.76] Take, eat, this is my body.
[4117.32 → 4118.88] And then he takes the cup, and he says,
[4119.26 → 4125.60] This is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
[4125.60 → 4133.22] Now, the Jewish men who make up Jesus' disciples reclining around this table,
[4133.78 → 4138.64] and many of the first audience of Matthew's telling this story,
[4139.02 → 4143.58] would hear in those words a very particular echo.
[4145.46 → 4153.16] These words call back to Moses' words in the covenant meal that takes place in Exodus 24.
[4153.16 → 4158.22] In Exodus 24, Moses sprinkled blood on the people,
[4158.42 → 4160.92] and then he says to them, in verse 8,
[4161.26 → 4165.34] This is the blood of the covenant that the Lord has made with you.
[4165.62 → 4167.50] And then, we read later on,
[4167.56 → 4170.84] that he ate and drank with the elders in God's presence.
[4172.38 → 4176.64] Now, in Exodus, this covenant meal takes place in the context
[4176.64 → 4180.66] of Moses explaining fellowship offerings.
[4180.90 → 4182.66] These are sometimes called peace offerings,
[4183.14 → 4187.52] which were meant to consecrate a meal before God
[4187.52 → 4193.12] and to share fellowship with him and a brother or sister in the community.
[4194.00 → 4197.00] Fellowship offerings have been called by others,
[4197.34 → 4199.08] sharing a meal with God.
[4199.08 → 4203.46] And by using these words, blood of the covenant,
[4203.98 → 4209.08] Jesus is showing us both the continuity from the old
[4209.08 → 4213.54] and the discontinuity in his doing a new thing, right?
[4213.60 → 4216.10] In fulfilling the first covenant era
[4216.10 → 4220.90] and in filling the new covenant era with new meaning,
[4221.68 → 4224.56] a new meaning that flows from the old.
[4224.56 → 4231.20] Jesus, in short, is the true and better Moses.
[4232.20 → 4235.94] This meal is the true and better meal.
[4236.96 → 4239.46] The blood that ratifies this covenant
[4239.46 → 4243.10] is not the blood of animals, but the blood of Jesus.
[4243.94 → 4248.30] And the covenant that he establishes at this moment is unbreakable,
[4248.48 → 4250.68] and there's something different about it
[4250.68 → 4252.42] in that, as we read elsewhere,
[4252.42 → 4257.08] it's written on the hearts of those who hear it
[4257.08 → 4259.00] and who receive it.
[4259.80 → 4264.50] And those hearts are transformed from stone into flesh.
[4265.42 → 4268.44] This is a fulfilling of what Jeremiah promises,
[4269.04 → 4271.00] or what God promises through Jeremiah
[4271.00 → 4274.26] in the promise of a new covenant in Jeremiah 31.
[4275.02 → 4278.10] This meal is the meal of the new covenant.
[4278.10 → 4282.62] That's what Jesus is instituting here at this moment.
[4283.40 → 4285.98] And for 2,000 years since then,
[4286.40 → 4290.74] the church has been hosting and having this meal together.
[4291.74 → 4294.98] Now, sometimes we call it the Eucharist,
[4295.32 → 4298.00] which comes from the Greek word Eucharist,
[4298.22 → 4299.40] which means to give thanks,
[4300.22 → 4302.96] because it's the Thanksgiving feast of the church.
[4302.96 → 4305.18] Sometimes it's called the Lord's Supper,
[4305.94 → 4307.52] because Jesus is the host.
[4307.90 → 4309.22] The Lord is the host,
[4309.32 → 4311.24] and he invites us to join his table.
[4311.92 → 4314.52] Sometimes it's referred to as the table.
[4315.32 → 4316.88] Sometimes it's called communion,
[4317.12 → 4319.00] again, because in this meal,
[4319.18 → 4321.08] we fellowship with God.
[4321.22 → 4323.78] We share a meal with him and with each other.
[4323.90 → 4325.70] We commune together.
[4325.70 → 4330.62] And Jesus gives us this meal,
[4330.84 → 4332.60] and in giving it to us,
[4332.62 → 4337.34] it's important to see that the direction is downward.
[4337.66 → 4339.98] It's from him to us.
[4340.12 → 4341.82] It's outward, as it were.
[4343.00 → 4345.52] It's a meal he gives to us.
[4346.24 → 4350.24] Even as the word of Jesus is outward,
[4350.70 → 4351.78] it's for us,
[4351.78 → 4356.38] this meal is from him to us.
[4356.46 → 4358.88] One scholar, Dale Brunei,
[4359.40 → 4360.72] he puts it this way.
[4361.46 → 4361.86] He says,
[4362.32 → 4363.24] in his word,
[4363.70 → 4365.62] Jesus talks to us spiritually.
[4366.38 → 4367.46] In his supper,
[4368.06 → 4369.94] Jesus touches us physically.
[4370.72 → 4371.38] And he goes on,
[4371.84 → 4373.76] Jesus gives his body to us
[4373.76 → 4375.54] in the bread and wine
[4375.54 → 4376.44] in a real,
[4376.88 → 4379.86] but not a carnal way.
[4381.78 → 4383.08] I want to acknowledge,
[4383.54 → 4384.14] it's right here,
[4385.08 → 4387.76] that I'm going to probably generate questions.
[4388.50 → 4390.16] And I'm happy to field your questions,
[4390.30 → 4392.26], but please know that I'm going away for three days.
[4392.84 → 4393.98] So if you email me,
[4394.24 → 4395.62] I'll get to it at the end of the week.
[4398.18 → 4400.24] The Bible itself, though,
[4401.08 → 4404.06] insists that the Lord's Supper
[4404.06 → 4406.44] is more than a memorial.
[4406.44 → 4411.42] Paul writes to the Corinthians,
[4412.12 → 4412.84] and he says,
[4413.20 → 4414.80] anyone who eats and drinks,
[4414.94 → 4416.42] that participates in this supper,
[4416.76 → 4418.22] without discerning the body,
[4418.40 → 4420.60] eats and drinks judgment on himself.
[4421.14 → 4421.78] He goes on,
[4421.86 → 4424.76] that is why many among you are weak and sick,
[4425.14 → 4427.40] and a number of you have fallen asleep.
[4427.40 → 4433.26] If the supper were only a reminder,
[4434.82 → 4437.12] how could there be real-life consequences,
[4437.80 → 4440.38] like sickness and death?
[4441.80 → 4443.94] Most people I have ever met
[4443.94 → 4446.34] don't get sick from misremembering.
[4447.62 → 4448.16] Right?
[4448.18 → 4449.52] You don't fall under judgment
[4449.52 → 4451.22] because of a faulty metaphor.
[4452.96 → 4455.16] Something more is happening here.
[4455.16 → 4457.22] Right?
[4457.26 → 4458.46] It's my contention
[4458.46 → 4460.08] that the living Christ
[4460.08 → 4462.84] is really present among His people
[4462.84 → 4464.42] when we come to the table.
[4465.62 → 4469.24] Present to bless those who receive in faith
[4469.24 → 4470.96] and who are present,
[4471.28 → 4473.58] and He is present then to judge
[4473.58 → 4477.62] those who mock and despise His gift.
[4478.90 → 4480.46] And I suggest to you, again,
[4480.58 → 4482.30] that this is the only way
[4482.30 → 4484.70] to make sense of Jesus' own words
[4484.70 → 4485.94] in John 6,
[4486.72 → 4487.68] where He says,
[4488.00 → 4489.42] unless you eat the flesh
[4489.42 → 4490.42] of the Son of Man
[4490.42 → 4491.48] and drink His blood,
[4491.60 → 4493.40] you have no life in you.
[4493.94 → 4494.98] And when He says that,
[4495.06 → 4497.32] the crowd are scandalized.
[4498.50 → 4498.80] Right?
[4498.84 → 4500.54] They understood that Jesus
[4500.54 → 4502.38] is going beyond metaphor,
[4503.06 → 4506.24] that He's pressing into something essential,
[4506.62 → 4507.94] even existential.
[4507.94 → 4509.60] right?
[4509.60 → 4512.36] He's speaking of a participation
[4512.36 → 4515.04] in His very life,
[4515.14 → 4516.80] a communion with Him
[4516.80 → 4519.22] that goes deeper than words alone,
[4519.34 → 4521.58] deeper than memory alone.
[4522.24 → 4524.02] And many people turn back from Him
[4524.02 → 4524.72] at this point
[4524.72 → 4526.04] because they couldn't handle it,
[4526.10 → 4528.02] they couldn't wrap their minds around it.
[4529.00 → 4530.20] But Peter stays.
[4531.32 → 4531.74] Right?
[4531.84 → 4532.44] Peter stays,
[4532.54 → 4532.98] and he says,
[4532.98 → 4533.54] Lord,
[4533.54 → 4533.56] Lord,
[4534.00 → 4535.48] to whom shall we go?
[4536.02 → 4538.28] You have the words of eternal life.
[4539.82 → 4540.44] And in there,
[4540.88 → 4542.28] we won't spend too much time on it,
[4542.32 → 4543.64] but note,
[4543.96 → 4546.48] the Bible makes a straight line connection
[4546.48 → 4548.54] between the words of eternal life
[4548.54 → 4550.70] and eating and drinking
[4550.70 → 4553.56] the flesh and blood of Jesus.
[4553.56 → 4556.20] So,
[4556.48 → 4557.94] when we come to the table,
[4558.78 → 4560.48] we aren't just recalling
[4560.48 → 4562.50] what Jesus did long ago.
[4563.20 → 4564.28] Memory matters,
[4564.42 → 4564.94] absolutely,
[4565.76 → 4567.64] but more is going on.
[4568.98 → 4569.56] Here,
[4569.80 → 4571.78] Christ Himself meets us
[4571.78 → 4573.00] in covenant fellowship.
[4573.98 → 4574.44] Here,
[4574.72 → 4576.68] as John Calvin said
[4576.68 → 4578.16] years ago,
[4578.36 → 4580.38] the sacred mystery of the supper
[4580.38 → 4582.20] consists in two things,
[4582.20 → 4583.94] the corporeal signs,
[4584.06 → 4585.54] which are set before our eyes,
[4585.68 → 4587.40] and the spiritual truth,
[4587.76 → 4589.34] which is at the same time
[4589.34 → 4591.40] represented and exhibited
[4591.40 → 4592.90] through them,
[4593.52 → 4595.00] through the corporeal signs.
[4595.78 → 4596.64] In other words,
[4596.90 → 4598.94] it's a real participation,
[4599.38 → 4600.60] a true encounter,
[4600.98 → 4601.84] a covenant meal
[4601.84 → 4603.70] where the king feeds his people
[4603.70 → 4605.18] with his own life.
[4606.42 → 4607.14] And again,
[4607.24 → 4608.38] as we draw this out
[4608.38 → 4610.80] and we go back in church history,
[4610.80 → 4612.46] the church of the second
[4612.46 → 4613.86] and third centuries
[4613.86 → 4615.56] understood this.
[4616.54 → 4618.06] The challenge of this
[4618.06 → 4619.12] actually worked out
[4619.12 → 4620.24] in their persecution.
[4622.52 → 4623.38] Early Christians
[4623.38 → 4625.00] were charged,
[4625.48 → 4627.00] among other things,
[4627.06 → 4628.28] with cannibalism
[4628.28 → 4629.82] and some other
[4629.82 → 4631.54] really abhorrent ideas.
[4631.68 → 4632.12] For example,
[4632.26 → 4633.54] one of the charges
[4633.54 → 4634.68] that was levelled
[4634.68 → 4635.64] against early Christians
[4635.64 → 4637.04] was that they would
[4637.04 → 4638.84] eat infants
[4638.84 → 4640.60] that were baked in dough
[4640.60 → 4643.08] and that they would drink,
[4643.30 → 4643.56] quote,
[4643.68 → 4645.42] loaves steeped in blood.
[4647.00 → 4647.68] Now,
[4647.84 → 4648.62] it's clear
[4648.62 → 4649.94] that these charges
[4649.94 → 4651.42] come from a misunderstanding
[4651.42 → 4653.10] of the Eucharist
[4653.10 → 4654.70] because the church
[4654.70 → 4655.84] has always used
[4655.84 → 4657.46] such realistic language
[4657.46 → 4658.60] to describe
[4658.60 → 4659.44] what's going on here.
[4660.58 → 4661.32] And likewise,
[4661.50 → 4662.88] the earliest church
[4662.88 → 4664.04] after the apostles
[4664.04 → 4665.28] understood
[4665.28 → 4666.42] that Jesus
[4666.42 → 4667.40] is present
[4667.40 → 4668.10] in the bread
[4668.10 → 4668.92] and in the wine
[4668.92 → 4669.98] in more than
[4669.98 → 4671.24] a symbolic way.
[4672.50 → 4674.04] But what they didn't do,
[4674.34 → 4675.28] and here it is important
[4675.28 → 4676.16] to continue with me,
[4676.24 → 4677.18] what they didn't do
[4677.18 → 4678.04] is attempt
[4678.04 → 4678.84] to describe
[4678.84 → 4679.84] the process
[4679.84 → 4681.34] or the change
[4681.34 → 4682.14] by which
[4682.14 → 4683.26] he is present.
[4685.02 → 4686.12] At the early church,
[4686.84 → 4687.60] in line with
[4687.60 → 4688.62] how the Bible itself
[4688.62 → 4689.52] talks about
[4689.52 → 4690.94] this holy meal,
[4691.40 → 4692.30] understood it
[4692.30 → 4693.92] as a holy mystery.
[4693.92 → 4697.18] Ignatius of Antioch
[4697.18 → 4697.68] called it
[4697.68 → 4698.36] the medicine
[4698.36 → 4699.92] of immortality.
[4701.10 → 4701.86] Justin Martyr
[4701.86 → 4702.92] said that
[4702.92 → 4703.92] we do not receive
[4703.92 → 4704.86] these as common
[4704.86 → 4705.74] bread and drink
[4705.74 → 4706.96] but as Jesus Christ,
[4707.06 → 4707.52] our Saviour,
[4707.72 → 4709.10] being made flesh.
[4709.78 → 4710.40] Grenades
[4710.40 → 4712.50] said the bread,
[4712.76 → 4713.54] receiving the word
[4713.54 → 4714.04] of God,
[4714.18 → 4715.60] becomes the Eucharist,
[4715.74 → 4716.70] the body of Christ.
[4717.30 → 4717.80] These are all
[4717.80 → 4718.72] second century
[4718.72 → 4719.80] church fathers.
[4720.60 → 4721.40] Years later,
[4721.58 → 4722.24] John Calvin,
[4722.70 → 4723.44] who's one of
[4723.44 → 4725.24] the magisterial reformers,
[4725.78 → 4726.98] John Calvin said
[4726.98 → 4727.98] of the supper,
[4728.42 → 4729.28] it's a mystery
[4729.28 → 4730.28] too lofty
[4730.28 → 4731.42] for either my mind
[4731.42 → 4732.06] to comprehend
[4732.06 → 4732.96] or my words
[4732.96 → 4733.54] to declare.
[4733.82 → 4735.40] I rather experience
[4735.40 → 4737.22] than understand it.
[4738.58 → 4739.18] Point is,
[4739.54 → 4740.78] the presence of God
[4740.78 → 4741.82] in the supper
[4741.82 → 4743.02] is not a puzzle
[4743.02 → 4743.96] to solve.
[4744.30 → 4745.90] It's the king's feast
[4745.90 → 4747.42] where covenant fellowship
[4747.42 → 4748.46] meets the deepest
[4748.46 → 4749.80] longings of the human heart.
[4749.80 → 4752.08] And so,
[4752.22 → 4753.54] we see the story
[4753.54 → 4754.68] of the king
[4754.68 → 4756.16] filling out
[4756.16 → 4756.86] or as it were,
[4756.96 → 4758.08] fleshing out
[4758.08 → 4759.54] a feast prepared
[4759.54 → 4760.84] not with tokens
[4760.84 → 4761.78] or symbols
[4761.78 → 4764.52] but with his very self.
[4765.86 → 4765.96] Right?
[4766.02 → 4766.46] That the heart
[4766.46 → 4767.28] of the heart
[4767.28 → 4767.78] of the heart
[4767.78 → 4768.44] the ache
[4768.44 → 4769.08] for love
[4769.08 → 4769.92] and for acceptance
[4769.92 → 4770.78] and for meaning
[4770.78 → 4771.74] is not met
[4771.74 → 4772.42] with snacks
[4772.42 → 4773.72] or temporary fixes
[4773.72 → 4775.18] but with covenant fellowship
[4775.18 → 4776.56] with Christ himself.
[4777.22 → 4778.98] The king sets his table
[4778.98 → 4780.28] in the bread
[4780.28 → 4781.12] and in the cup
[4781.12 → 4781.78] in the blood
[4781.78 → 4782.38] of the covenant.
[4782.52 → 4783.90] He offers something greater
[4783.90 → 4785.58] than we could ever imagine.
[4786.74 → 4787.60] His presence,
[4788.18 → 4788.96] his life,
[4789.24 → 4789.88] a promise
[4789.88 → 4790.72] that satisfies
[4790.72 → 4792.12] the deepest longings
[4792.12 → 4792.98] of our hearts.
[4792.98 → 4794.60] this is the feast
[4794.60 → 4796.40] we were made for.
[4796.90 → 4798.86] The true banquet of God
[4798.86 → 4801.14] and every taste of it
[4801.14 → 4803.52] points to the eternal joy
[4803.52 → 4804.54] that will one day
[4804.54 → 4806.16] be fully revealed.
[4807.96 → 4809.14] Now, after Jesus
[4809.14 → 4809.92] takes the bread
[4809.92 → 4810.54] and the cup,
[4810.62 → 4811.26] he declares,
[4811.74 → 4812.92] this is my body
[4812.92 → 4814.42] and this is my blood
[4814.42 → 4815.60] of the covenant.
[4817.00 → 4817.38] And again,
[4817.46 → 4818.30] in doing this,
[4818.36 → 4819.46] he's not setting
[4819.46 → 4820.06] the table
[4820.06 → 4821.16] of mere bread
[4821.16 → 4822.46] and mere wine
[4822.46 → 4824.40] but of himself.
[4825.72 → 4826.16] Now, Matthew
[4826.16 → 4827.12] is intentionally
[4827.12 → 4829.18] echoing Exodus 24
[4829.18 → 4830.72] where we already saw
[4830.72 → 4831.98] Moses ratified
[4831.98 → 4832.84] the covenant
[4832.84 → 4833.40] with the blood
[4833.40 → 4834.08] of sacrifice
[4834.08 → 4834.98] and ate with elders
[4834.98 → 4836.40] and we're here seeing,
[4836.56 → 4836.80] again,
[4836.96 → 4838.00] Matthew underscoring
[4838.00 → 4839.10] a point he has made
[4839.10 → 4840.02] for us over
[4840.02 → 4841.12] and over and over
[4841.12 → 4842.66] that Jesus
[4842.66 → 4843.38] is the true
[4843.38 → 4844.68] and better Moses
[4844.68 → 4845.82] and that the blood
[4845.82 → 4847.18] that seals his covenant
[4847.18 → 4848.02] is his own
[4848.02 → 4848.90] and that the fellowship
[4848.90 → 4849.76] that he offers
[4849.76 → 4851.26] is unbreakable.
[4852.38 → 4853.60] Every bite of bread,
[4853.70 → 4854.86] every sip of wine
[4854.86 → 4856.74] points to covenant life
[4856.74 → 4858.14] with the king himself,
[4858.30 → 4859.36] life that satisfies
[4859.36 → 4861.22] what nothing else can do.
[4862.08 → 4862.36] And again,
[4862.42 → 4863.44] this isn't about rituals
[4863.44 → 4864.28] or tokens,
[4864.28 → 4865.66] it's about presence
[4865.66 → 4866.28] and relationship
[4866.84 → 4867.92] and invitation
[4867.92 → 4869.44] into the reality
[4869.44 → 4870.68] of God's kingdom,
[4871.44 → 4872.10] a reality
[4872.10 → 4873.42] that he is inviting you
[4873.42 → 4875.12] to take into yourself.
[4875.12 → 4879.98] And again,
[4880.28 → 4881.64] for centuries,
[4882.70 → 4883.72] Christians have wrestled
[4883.72 → 4885.08] with how to explain
[4885.08 → 4886.32] Christ's presence
[4886.32 → 4887.10] in the supper.
[4889.40 → 4890.98] And as I dig in here
[4890.98 → 4891.70] a little more,
[4892.52 → 4893.60] I want to be really careful
[4893.60 → 4894.84] with my language
[4894.84 → 4897.14] because I don't ordinarily
[4897.14 → 4898.00] like to stand
[4898.00 → 4898.62] in the pulpit
[4898.62 → 4900.58] and call out divisions
[4900.58 → 4902.20] in the church
[4902.20 → 4904.02] because I really do believe
[4904.02 → 4904.88] that we are living
[4904.88 → 4905.52] in a time
[4905.52 → 4906.14] and a place
[4906.14 → 4907.26] where the church
[4907.26 → 4908.40] is set in opposition
[4908.40 → 4909.08] to culture
[4909.08 → 4910.30] and the best response
[4910.30 → 4911.04] that we can give
[4911.04 → 4911.48] in that
[4911.48 → 4913.08] is a united church.
[4914.50 → 4915.64] But I do have to address
[4915.64 → 4916.34] part of that
[4916.34 → 4917.16] in our conversation
[4917.16 → 4917.68] this morning
[4917.68 → 4920.66] because as the church
[4920.66 → 4921.76] continued to wrestle
[4921.76 → 4922.78] with this idea,
[4923.72 → 4924.44] theologians
[4924.44 → 4925.40] in the Middle Ages
[4925.40 → 4926.40] in the sort of
[4926.40 → 4928.44] 10th to 13th century,
[4928.98 → 4930.58] drawing on
[4930.58 → 4931.92] a rediscovery
[4931.92 → 4932.92] of the philosophy
[4932.92 → 4933.92] of Aristotle,
[4934.72 → 4935.66] developed what has
[4935.66 → 4936.56] become known
[4936.56 → 4937.38] in the Roman
[4937.38 → 4937.96] Christian
[4937.96 → 4939.70] as the doctrine
[4939.70 → 4941.22] of transubstantiation.
[4942.62 → 4943.80] Now, really quickly,
[4944.64 → 4945.32] the doctrine
[4945.32 → 4946.52] of transubstantiation
[4946.52 → 4949.00] was codified,
[4949.12 → 4949.94] was affirmed
[4949.94 → 4952.36] in 1215
[4952.36 → 4954.24] at the Fourth Lateran Council.
[4954.60 → 4955.04] But here,
[4955.18 → 4956.86] that's 12 centuries
[4956.86 → 4960.18] after the text
[4960.18 → 4960.72] of Scripture
[4960.72 → 4961.72] was written.
[4962.26 → 4962.70] Later,
[4963.24 → 4964.20] the Council of Trent,
[4964.30 → 4964.76] which happened
[4964.76 → 4965.78] after the Reformation
[4965.78 → 4966.44] in response
[4966.44 → 4967.26] to the Reformation,
[4967.78 → 4968.76] took it even further
[4968.76 → 4970.20] and elevated
[4970.20 → 4971.14] the doctrine
[4971.14 → 4972.56] of transubstantiation
[4972.56 → 4973.88] and pronounced
[4973.88 → 4974.98] an anathema
[4974.98 → 4976.06] on anyone
[4976.06 → 4976.88] who denied it.
[4977.52 → 4978.34] Now, an anathema
[4978.34 → 4980.24] in Roman Catholic doctrine
[4980.24 → 4981.60] is a formal
[4981.60 → 4982.82] excommunication.
[4983.82 → 4984.78] What that means
[4984.78 → 4985.16] is people
[4985.16 → 4986.20] who don't believe it
[4986.20 → 4987.22] are declared
[4987.22 → 4988.68] to be not Christian.
[4991.36 → 4992.78] Now, as we dig in,
[4993.12 → 4993.68] it's important
[4993.68 → 4994.44] for me to say
[4994.44 → 4996.38] that this doctrine
[4996.38 → 4997.72] of transubstantiation
[4997.72 → 4999.00] is not invented
[4999.00 → 4999.84] from nothing.
[5000.74 → 5001.12] That is,
[5001.18 → 5002.20] it's an explanation
[5002.20 → 5003.44] of a faith
[5003.44 → 5004.56] that was already held,
[5004.94 → 5006.86] but it did represent
[5006.86 → 5007.64] a shift.
[5009.26 → 5009.58] Right?
[5009.64 → 5010.34] What had once
[5010.34 → 5011.56] been a mystery
[5011.56 → 5013.22] embraced in worship
[5013.22 → 5015.22] became a mechanism
[5015.22 → 5017.76] explained in philosophy.
[5019.30 → 5020.08] Now, again,
[5020.50 → 5021.36] let me be really clear.
[5021.46 → 5022.22] There's nothing wrong
[5022.22 → 5023.80] with faith-seeking
[5023.80 → 5024.52] understanding.
[5024.90 → 5025.56] There's nothing wrong
[5025.56 → 5026.44] with philosophy.
[5026.84 → 5028.02] My undergraduate degree
[5028.02 → 5029.38] is a minor in philosophy.
[5029.96 → 5031.22] But what happened here
[5031.22 → 5031.86] and what I think
[5031.86 → 5032.92] the problem here
[5032.92 → 5034.18] is the church
[5034.18 → 5036.10] made this particular
[5036.10 → 5038.20] philosophical explanation
[5038.20 → 5039.52] binding
[5039.52 → 5041.54] on all consciences.
[5041.54 → 5042.98] Right?
[5043.02 → 5043.96] The Council of Trent
[5043.96 → 5045.46] elevated a human
[5045.46 → 5046.28] explanation
[5046.28 → 5047.98] of the difference
[5047.98 → 5048.78] between substance
[5048.78 → 5049.78] and accidents,
[5049.88 → 5051.02] which gets into Aristotle.
[5051.28 → 5052.28] They elevated that
[5052.28 → 5053.00] to the level
[5053.00 → 5054.50] of necessary dogma.
[5055.60 → 5056.16] What had been
[5056.16 → 5057.76] a mystery of faith
[5057.76 → 5058.24] became,
[5058.68 → 5059.04] for them,
[5059.12 → 5060.50] a test of orthodoxy.
[5061.70 → 5062.48] And instead of
[5062.48 → 5063.42] uniting the church
[5063.42 → 5064.56] in a biblical confession
[5064.56 → 5065.54] and doxology,
[5065.98 → 5067.48] it narrowed the church
[5067.48 → 5069.32] around Aristotelian
[5069.32 → 5069.96] categories.
[5069.96 → 5073.60] And I hope you're seeing
[5073.60 → 5074.86] that at the heart
[5074.86 → 5076.38] of the problem here
[5076.38 → 5077.88] is that the supper
[5077.88 → 5080.12] is not first about mechanics
[5080.12 → 5081.48] or about philosophy.
[5082.04 → 5083.54] It's about the king
[5083.54 → 5084.58] offering himself
[5084.58 → 5085.38] to his people.
[5086.64 → 5088.06] And when the explanation
[5088.06 → 5089.56] of how that happened
[5089.56 → 5090.98] becomes the measure
[5090.98 → 5092.30] of faith,
[5092.66 → 5094.66] it risks eclipsing
[5094.66 → 5096.14] the very Christ
[5096.14 → 5098.90] intended to be seen.
[5098.90 → 5100.28] the very gift
[5100.28 → 5101.30] intended to be given,
[5101.40 → 5102.46] that of covenant life,
[5102.60 → 5103.50] of satisfaction
[5103.50 → 5104.70] for the soul
[5104.70 → 5105.42] and of fellowship
[5105.42 → 5106.40] with God.
[5107.48 → 5107.86] And again,
[5107.92 → 5109.06] the earliest church
[5109.06 → 5110.02] understood this.
[5110.48 → 5111.60] And it's my contention
[5111.60 → 5112.62] that the Reformation
[5112.62 → 5113.98] reclaimed this.
[5114.90 → 5115.10] Right?
[5115.12 → 5115.78] That the Reformed
[5115.78 → 5116.44] understanding
[5116.44 → 5118.10] is actually more in line
[5118.10 → 5119.04] with the church fathers
[5119.04 → 5120.90] and also more in line
[5120.90 → 5121.72] with the mystery
[5121.72 → 5122.80] of the Bible
[5122.80 → 5124.12] as it talks about
[5124.12 → 5125.22] the supper for us.
[5126.32 → 5126.52] Right?
[5126.52 → 5128.90] The supper is the king's feast,
[5129.00 → 5129.84] a covenant meal
[5129.84 → 5131.48] where the deepest longings
[5131.48 → 5132.18] of our heart
[5132.18 → 5134.06] are met by Christ's presence
[5134.06 → 5136.30] in real, relational,
[5136.66 → 5138.46] and transformative ways.
[5139.34 → 5140.06] But how?
[5141.18 → 5143.04] I dare not speak that mystery.
[5146.04 → 5147.72] Now, Jesus closes this meal
[5147.72 → 5149.44] with a promise.
[5149.44 → 5151.52] He says,
[5151.66 → 5152.88] I will not drink again
[5152.88 → 5154.28] of this fruit of the vine
[5154.28 → 5155.20] until that day
[5155.20 → 5156.14] when I drink it new
[5156.14 → 5157.00] with you
[5157.00 → 5158.18] in my Father's kingdom.
[5159.30 → 5160.54] The covenant meal
[5160.54 → 5162.06] points forward
[5162.06 → 5164.24] to that final banquet,
[5164.40 → 5165.98] to that wedding feast
[5165.98 → 5166.56] of the Lamb
[5166.56 → 5167.26] that we read about
[5167.26 → 5168.46] in Revelation 19.
[5169.04 → 5170.94] What began at Sinai,
[5171.12 → 5172.00] anticipated through
[5172.00 → 5173.24] the blood of sacrifice,
[5173.58 → 5174.48] what is fulfilled
[5174.48 → 5175.70] in Christ Jesus,
[5175.88 → 5177.26] now draws us
[5177.26 → 5178.96] to covenant fellowship
[5178.96 → 5180.58] and foreshadowing
[5180.58 → 5182.18] that eternal joy
[5182.18 → 5184.30] of that fully realized
[5184.30 → 5186.44] final kingdom of God
[5186.44 → 5187.14] in the restoration
[5187.14 → 5188.54] of all things.
[5189.26 → 5190.40] Every celebration
[5190.40 → 5192.10] of this meal
[5192.10 → 5193.68] invites us
[5193.68 → 5195.52] to taste and see
[5195.52 → 5197.16] the king's presence
[5197.16 → 5198.70] and reminds us
[5198.70 → 5199.38] that the hunger
[5199.38 → 5200.26] of the meal
[5200.26 → 5201.44] in this life
[5201.44 → 5202.64] is not meaningless,
[5203.06 → 5203.88] but rather it is
[5203.88 → 5204.50] a pointer
[5204.50 → 5205.64] to the feast
[5205.64 → 5206.86] that God has prepared,
[5207.40 → 5208.24] a promise
[5208.24 → 5209.46] that one day
[5209.46 → 5211.46] will be fully realized.
[5213.54 → 5214.78] So here we are
[5214.78 → 5217.00] in the story
[5217.00 → 5220.26] striving to behold
[5220.26 → 5221.66] our king.
[5223.24 → 5225.00] We all carry a hunger.
[5226.18 → 5227.66] We all chase comfort
[5227.66 → 5228.70] and approval.
[5229.12 → 5229.84] We all long
[5229.84 → 5230.58] for success
[5230.58 → 5231.50] or connection,
[5231.98 → 5233.22] hoping that one bite
[5233.22 → 5234.34] or one achievement
[5234.34 → 5235.88] will finally satisfy.
[5237.08 → 5237.92] And like the parent
[5237.92 → 5239.12] who works long hours
[5239.12 → 5241.00] yet still feels lonely,
[5241.14 → 5241.92] like the young adult
[5241.92 → 5242.90] who's scrolling
[5242.90 → 5243.92] for validation,
[5244.42 → 5246.02] like even the caterpillar
[5246.02 → 5246.94] who's moving
[5246.94 → 5247.72] from one thing
[5247.72 → 5248.32] to the next,
[5248.66 → 5249.32] eating more
[5249.32 → 5250.10] and eating more
[5250.10 → 5251.68] and still feeling empty,
[5251.82 → 5252.76] our lives
[5252.76 → 5254.16] are full of snacks
[5254.16 → 5256.54] that never truly feed us.
[5257.80 → 5258.70] But Jesus,
[5259.36 → 5259.84] Jesus,
[5260.48 → 5261.50] in his word
[5261.50 → 5263.22] and at his table,
[5263.22 → 5264.52] meets us
[5264.52 → 5265.50] with a feast
[5265.50 → 5267.06] unlike anything
[5267.06 → 5268.56] the world can offer.
[5270.34 → 5272.24] And at that last supper,
[5272.54 → 5273.64] he offers us
[5273.64 → 5275.20] his very self,
[5275.34 → 5276.34] bread and wine
[5276.34 → 5278.36] made covenant blood
[5278.36 → 5279.32] that secures
[5279.32 → 5280.84] unbreakable fellowship
[5280.84 → 5281.92] with God,
[5282.56 → 5283.38] a presence
[5283.38 → 5284.58] that satisfies
[5284.58 → 5286.20] the deepest longings
[5286.20 → 5287.24] of our heart.
[5287.24 → 5288.24] God,
[5288.24 → 5293.62] the king has set
[5293.62 → 5294.28] his table
[5294.28 → 5296.30] not just for a moment
[5296.30 → 5298.26] but for eternity.
[5299.64 → 5300.60] The church
[5300.60 → 5301.42] has called it
[5301.42 → 5303.22] a holy mystery.
[5304.02 → 5304.86] Calvin called it
[5304.86 → 5306.00] something to be
[5306.00 → 5307.06] received
[5307.06 → 5308.46] rather than solved.
[5309.06 → 5309.70] And the scriptures
[5309.70 → 5310.38] show us
[5310.38 → 5311.84] that this covenant meal
[5311.84 → 5313.20] points us towards
[5313.20 → 5314.66] the eternal banquet
[5314.66 → 5315.68] of the Lamb.
[5315.68 → 5318.06] all of our longing,
[5318.66 → 5320.24] all of our unquenched hunger,
[5320.42 → 5321.94] all the empty feasts
[5321.94 → 5322.88] that we have tried
[5322.88 → 5324.52] to fill ourselves with,
[5324.60 → 5325.84] all of those things
[5325.84 → 5327.58] find their answer
[5327.58 → 5329.56] in Christ alone.
[5331.14 → 5332.64] Like that little caterpillar,
[5332.80 → 5334.22] our endless snacking
[5334.22 → 5335.80] never transforms us.
[5336.02 → 5337.12] Only when we come
[5337.12 → 5338.00] to the right food
[5338.00 → 5338.78] at the right time,
[5338.84 → 5339.84] to the true food,
[5340.14 → 5341.64] to Jesus Christ himself,
[5341.78 → 5343.02] are we changed
[5343.02 → 5344.70] into what we are meant
[5344.70 → 5345.58] to be.
[5346.30 → 5347.66] The ache in our hearts,
[5348.44 → 5349.20] the yearning
[5349.20 → 5349.88] that we have felt
[5349.88 → 5350.76] our whole lives
[5350.76 → 5351.96] is not a mistake
[5351.96 → 5353.18] nor is it a weakness.
[5353.48 → 5354.12] It is God
[5354.12 → 5355.84] pointing to himself
[5355.84 → 5357.58] in us.
[5358.66 → 5359.60] The king has set
[5359.60 → 5360.28] his table
[5360.28 → 5361.74] and in his presence
[5361.74 → 5362.86] the hunger is met,
[5363.32 → 5364.70] the longing is answered,
[5364.96 → 5366.08] and the promise
[5366.08 → 5366.76] of life
[5366.76 → 5368.18] is made real.
[5368.18 → 5371.90] And so we leave
[5371.90 → 5372.68] this story
[5372.68 → 5374.92] not really with a question
[5374.92 → 5376.88] about what we still lack,
[5377.88 → 5380.04] but I pray in an awe
[5380.04 → 5381.98] and with a sense
[5381.98 → 5383.12] of mystery
[5383.12 → 5384.68] about what we have
[5384.68 → 5385.24] been given.
[5386.72 → 5387.96] The hunger in your heart
[5387.96 → 5388.66] is not a call
[5388.66 → 5389.28] to desperation,
[5389.28 → 5390.54] it is an invitation
[5390.54 → 5391.68] to your king.
[5392.38 → 5393.18] Every ache
[5393.18 → 5394.00] and every longing,
[5394.18 → 5395.34] every unfulfilled desire
[5395.34 → 5396.84] points to the feast
[5396.84 → 5398.16] that he prepares for you.
[5399.26 → 5400.26] The king's table
[5400.26 → 5400.76] is ready.
[5401.84 → 5402.40] The feast
[5402.40 → 5403.16] is for you.
[5403.52 → 5403.98] The hunger
[5403.98 → 5404.68] in your heart,
[5404.76 → 5405.72] the one that no promotion
[5405.72 → 5406.44] or relationship
[5406.44 → 5407.12] or scrolling
[5407.12 → 5407.82] can ever fill,
[5408.16 → 5409.82] finds its feast
[5409.82 → 5411.30] at the king's table
[5411.30 → 5413.24] where Jesus himself
[5413.24 → 5413.96] is the bread
[5413.96 → 5414.74] that satisfies
[5414.74 → 5416.14] and the presence
[5416.14 → 5417.10] that transforms.
[5418.26 → 5418.84] The king
[5418.84 → 5420.20] has set his table
[5420.20 → 5422.02] and in his presence
[5422.02 → 5423.12] every longing
[5423.12 → 5424.78] finds its feast,
[5425.00 → 5425.66] every ache,
[5425.66 → 5426.72] its answer
[5426.72 → 5428.04] and every heart
[5428.04 → 5429.90] its home.
[5430.92 → 5431.22] Amen.
[5432.12 → 5433.20] Let's pray together.
[5440.08 → 5441.48] Lord Jesus,
[5442.14 → 5444.00] by your Holy Spirit
[5444.00 → 5445.00] and the power
[5445.00 → 5445.72] of your word,
[5446.24 → 5447.68] both captivate
[5447.68 → 5448.74] and transform
[5448.74 → 5450.44] our imaginations
[5450.44 → 5451.50] today.
[5451.50 → 5455.56] help us to
[5455.56 → 5457.20] get a little bit
[5457.20 → 5457.88] of a glimpse
[5457.88 → 5459.08] into the mystery
[5459.08 → 5460.60] of the supper,
[5461.18 → 5462.20] into the mystery
[5462.20 → 5463.48] of your word,
[5463.66 → 5464.54] into the mystery
[5464.54 → 5465.66] of how you make
[5465.66 → 5466.58] yourself known
[5466.58 → 5467.60] to us.
[5469.28 → 5470.42] And as we go
[5470.42 → 5471.40] from this place,
[5472.08 → 5473.08] may our longing
[5473.08 → 5474.12] for that great
[5474.12 → 5475.78] and final feast
[5475.78 → 5476.50] be grown.
[5476.50 → 5477.62] grown.
[5478.82 → 5479.72] May our longing
[5479.72 → 5480.58] for that great
[5480.58 → 5482.12] day of the Lord,
[5482.22 → 5482.70] that day
[5482.70 → 5483.88] of your return
[5483.88 → 5485.40] be drawn
[5485.40 → 5486.14] forward
[5486.14 → 5488.90] and draw out
[5488.90 → 5489.50] of us
[5489.50 → 5490.46] at this moment
[5490.46 → 5491.26] and in the days
[5491.26 → 5491.70] and weeks
[5491.70 → 5492.28] and moments
[5492.28 → 5492.90] to come
[5492.90 → 5494.12] a heart
[5494.12 → 5495.56] that worships
[5495.56 → 5496.76] and marvels
[5496.76 → 5497.64] at the mystery
[5497.64 → 5499.12] of our faith.
[5499.12 → 5502.62] Lord Jesus,
[5503.12 → 5504.48] as we have
[5504.48 → 5505.22] heard you,
[5506.18 → 5506.96] as we have
[5506.96 → 5507.68] seen you,
[5508.36 → 5509.22] and as we long
[5509.22 → 5510.00] to see more
[5510.00 → 5510.44] of you,
[5511.36 → 5512.20] send us out
[5512.20 → 5513.00] in the power
[5513.00 → 5514.20] of your Holy Spirit
[5514.20 → 5514.72] now.
[5515.22 → 5516.40] In Jesus' name,
[5517.40 → 5517.74] Amen.
[5517.74 → 5517.84] Amen.
[5529.12 → 5529.66] Amen.
[5535.84 → 5536.26] Amen.
[5541.76 → 5541.92] Amen.
[5546.28 → 5548.16] Amen.
[5549.46 → 5549.78] You stood
[5549.78 → 5552.82] before creation
[5552.82 → 5556.14] eternity
[5556.14 → 5558.36] in your hand
[5559.12 → 5565.30] You spoke the earth into motion
[5565.30 → 5570.16] My soul now to stand
[5570.16 → 5578.10] You stood before my failure
[5578.10 → 5585.14] And carried the cross for my shame
[5585.14 → 5591.02] My sin weighed upon your shoulders
[5591.02 → 5594.60] My soul now to stand
[5594.60 → 5600.84] So what can I say?
[5602.98 → 5607.26] What can I do?
[5607.26 → 5615.72] I offer this heart, O God
[5615.72 → 5621.72] Completely to you
[5621.72 → 5628.76] Walk upon salvation
[5628.76 → 5635.54] Your spirit alive in me
[5635.54 → 5641.36] My life to declare your promise
[5641.36 → 5644.94] My soul now to stand
[5644.94 → 5650.96] So what can I say?
[5650.96 → 5656.84] What can I do?
[5659.42 → 5664.42] But offer this heart, O God
[5664.42 → 5670.42] Completely to you
[5670.42 → 5675.88] So what can I say?
[5675.88 → 5681.88] What can I do?
[5681.88 → 5689.88] But offer this heart, O God
[5689.88 → 5694.88] Completely to you
[5694.88 → 5707.34] So I'll stand
[5707.34 → 5711.42] With arms high and heart abandoned
[5711.42 → 5718.34] In awe of the one who gave it all
[5718.34 → 5719.80] I'll stand
[5719.80 → 5720.30] I'll stand
[5720.30 → 5722.36] My soul, Lord
[5722.36 → 5722.90] To you
[5722.90 → 5723.80] Surrender
[5723.80 → 5728.26] All I am is yours
[5728.26 → 5732.26] I'll stand
[5732.26 → 5736.26] With arms high and heart abandoned
[5736.26 → 5742.86] In awe of the one who gave it all
[5742.86 → 5744.26] I'll stand
[5744.26 → 5746.26] My soul, Lord
[5746.26 → 5747.26] To you
[5747.26 → 5748.34] Surrender
[5748.34 → 5752.80] All I am is yours
[5752.80 → 5756.80] I'll stand
[5756.80 → 5760.80] With arms high and heart abandoned
[5760.80 → 5766.80] In awe of the one who gave it all
[5766.80 → 5768.80] I'll stand
[5768.80 → 5770.80] My soul, Lord
[5770.80 → 5772.30] To you
[5772.30 → 5772.80] Surrender
[5772.80 → 5776.80] All I am is yours
[5776.80 → 5797.34] Together we stand
[5797.34 → 5799.64] And together we are sent
[5799.64 → 5806.12] Commissioned to minister the presence of Jesus to the world
[5806.12 → 5808.92] And so God himself goes with us
[5808.92 → 5811.54] Receive the blessing of our God
[5811.54 → 5812.70] As we go
[5812.70 → 5815.74] God go before you
[5815.74 → 5816.84] To lead you
[5816.84 → 5818.82] God go behind you
[5818.82 → 5819.96] To protect you
[5819.96 → 5821.76] God go beneath you
[5821.76 → 5822.76] To support you
[5822.76 → 5824.52] And God go beside you
[5824.52 → 5825.66] To befriend you
[5825.66 → 5828.34] Do not be afraid
[5828.34 → 5831.10] Let the blessing of God come upon you today
[5831.10 → 5832.76] Do not be afraid
[5832.76 → 5833.98] But go
[5833.98 → 5835.28] In peace
[5835.28 → 5836.12] To love
[5836.12 → 5837.06] And serve
[5837.06 → 5837.84] The Lord
[5837.84 → 5839.38] Amen
[5839.38 → 5862.80] What can wash away my sin?
[5862.80 → 5866.80] Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[5866.80 → 5871.26] What can make me whole again?
[5871.26 → 5874.76] Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[5874.76 → 5879.10] Oh, precious is the flow
[5879.10 → 5883.04] That makes me white as snow
[5883.04 → 5884.34] All you
[5884.34 → 5887.04] No longer felt I know
[5887.04 → 5890.58] Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[5890.58 → 5897.92] For my pardon this I see
[5897.92 → 5901.54] Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[5901.54 → 5905.84] For my cleansing this I flee
