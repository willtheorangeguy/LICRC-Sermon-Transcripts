[673.42 → 676.48] So may that be something that we remember and cherish this day as well.
[676.86 → 677.96] My name is Kevin Robert.
[678.00 → 680.40] I'm the youth pastor here at Langley Emanuel CRC.
[680.74 → 682.14] It's good to see you all here today.
[682.38 → 684.36] Just a couple of announcements before we begin.
[684.36 → 689.24] I'm actually going to invite right now, Josh Chamberlain's going to make his way forward.
[689.30 → 690.82] But I'm also going to invite Jared Obama.
[691.44 → 693.10] And Sarah's on the piano.
[693.16 → 693.94] You're going to stand up, Sarah.
[694.02 → 695.26] And I'm not sure if McKelvy made it in.
[695.26 → 696.08] I know she had a cold.
[696.82 → 697.58] Did she make it back?
[697.64 → 697.78] No.
[697.86 → 698.64] She's homesick.
[698.64 → 705.76] But these three just landed back in the country last night from the Philippines.
[705.98 → 706.90] They were there for two weeks.
[707.48 → 708.76] And so we welcome them back.
[709.34 → 711.36] We welcome McKelvy back too.
[712.34 → 714.58] And then they've got an announcement for us as well.
[715.38 → 715.98] Hello.
[716.34 → 719.66] So normally we only do missions trips to Mexico.
[719.90 → 723.42] And after that we have a little luncheon.
[723.42 → 727.96] And then everybody gets to hear all the great stories from the youth that went to Mexico.
[728.64 → 730.78] Well, there's no youth and there's no Mexico.
[730.78 → 736.86] But you can still come hear our stories at a pancake breakfast on the 29th of June.
[737.28 → 739.94] At about 7.30 the doors will be open.
[740.18 → 741.18] We'll have pancakes ready.
[741.66 → 745.62] And then we'll, after everybody's eaten, we'll share the stories before church.
[746.36 → 747.88] So please come join us.
[748.06 → 750.64] Also it's a fundraiser because we had to do our fundraising after the fact.
[752.42 → 754.08] Because Mexico takes precedent.
[754.54 → 757.48] So bring your loonies.
[758.64 → 759.76] All right.
[760.02 → 760.66] Thank you, Mexico.
[760.76 → 761.74] Another round of applause for them.
[761.80 → 763.54] We'll get to hear about their trip soon.
[765.52 → 767.28] Just a few more announcements right now.
[767.36 → 768.80] On Tuesday we've got a council meeting.
[768.90 → 773.36] So if you're a council member, Elder Deacon, please come on out to that Tuesday night.
[773.78 → 775.30] We will look forward to seeing you there.
[776.20 → 776.94] Reactivate sign up.
[776.94 → 782.38] We are hosting Reactivate once again, technically the second weekend in September.
[782.50 → 783.94] September 5, 6, and 7.
[784.48 → 786.68] The volunteer sign up has come out.
[786.94 → 788.86] And it has already started filling out, which is lovely.
[788.96 → 792.22] But there are lots of places that are looking for some volunteers.
[792.44 → 797.10] So if that's something that you're interested in, we need a lot of people to come make that weekend possible.
[797.10 → 801.06] We are hearing of at least two new churches coming.
[801.20 → 806.36] So that will bring the total up to over a dozen churches from BC coming this way with their youth.
[806.44 → 807.24] So that's really exciting.
[807.34 → 809.98] So please consider volunteering for that weekend as well.
[809.98 → 821.24] And then finally, a save the date on Sunday, July 12th, we will be doing a food drive and community sort of fun day here at the church.
[821.24 → 825.72] So that's Sunday, July 12th, in the morning, I believe.
[825.86 → 829.52] So keep your eyes on the bulletin for more details to come about that.
[829.86 → 835.52] And we look forward to that weekend as well where we invite the whole neighbourhood here to bring in food for the food bank.
[836.00 → 837.90] That's all the announcements this morning.
[837.90 → 842.30] I'm going to invite Pastor Chris forward, and he's going to do God's greeting for us today.
[847.06 → 847.92] Thanks, Kevin.
[848.58 → 854.10] Why don't we stand together as we usher into the presence of God today?
[856.46 → 861.40] We gather in his presence, and we mark that presence by receiving his greeting.
[861.40 → 869.96] So I invite you to open your heart, take a posture of receipt, and allow God's Spirit to wash over us in worship together.
[871.32 → 874.60] Grace, mercy, and peace to you.
[875.08 → 881.46] From God, our Father, from Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Saviour, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[882.32 → 882.62] Amen.

[1802.96 → 1809.60] Let your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy.
[1809.60 → 1817.38] If you, Lord, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand?
[1817.38 → 1824.90] But with you there is forgiveness, so that we can, with reverence, serve you.
[1824.90 → 1826.76] I wait for the Lord.
[1826.76 → 1831.64] My whole being waits, and in his word I put my hope.
[1831.64 → 1834.98] I wait for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning.
[1835.98 → 1838.18] More than watchmen wait for the morning.
[1839.28 → 1842.04] Israel, put your hope in the Lord.
[1843.24 → 1848.86] For with the Lord is unfailing love, and with him is full redemption.
[1848.86 → 1858.50] He himself will redeem Israel from all their sins.
[1858.50 → 1865.26] Our faithful Father, eternal God, was the same to the psalmist as he is to us today.
[1865.26 → 1872.66] Know that you are not alone, no matter your situation, your pain, your sin.
[1872.66 → 1877.96] He walks with you and beacons you to call on him.
[1877.96 → 1879.78] Let's sing.
[1879.78 → 1880.68] Bye.
[1880.84 → 1883.20] Bye.
[1901.16 → 1902.00] Oh
[1902.00 → 1911.20] I'm calling on the God of Jacob
[1911.20 → 1917.32] His love endures to generations
[1917.32 → 1924.36] I know that He will keep your covenant
[1924.36 → 1930.00] I'm calling on the God of Moses
[1930.00 → 1936.56] The one who opened up the ocean
[1936.56 → 1945.00] I need you now to do the same thing for me
[1945.00 → 1954.44] Oh God, my God, I need you
[1954.44 → 1958.00] Oh God, my God, I need you now
[1958.00 → 1962.00] How I need you now
[1962.00 → 1966.56] Oh rock, oh rock of ages
[1966.56 → 1972.56] I'm standing on your faithfulness
[1972.56 → 1981.12] I'm calling on the God of Mary
[1981.12 → 1987.68] Whose favour rests upon the lowly
[1987.68 → 1994.16] I know with you all things are possible
[1994.16 → 2000.72] I'm calling on the God of David
[2000.72 → 2005.84] Who made a shepherd, what courageous
[2005.84 → 2011.04] I may not miss the lion
[2011.04 → 2013.72] But I got my own giant
[2013.72 → 2017.72] Oh God, my God, I need you
[2017.72 → 2020.28] Oh God, my God, I need you
[2020.28 → 2023.72] Now, now I need you
[2023.72 → 2026.28] Now, now I need you
[2026.28 → 2029.72] Oh rock, oh rock of ages
[2029.72 → 2034.28] I'm standing on your faithfulness
[2034.28 → 2040.28] You hurt your children then
[2040.28 → 2044.28] You hear your children now
[2044.28 → 2058.84] You are the same God
[2058.84 → 2062.28] You are the same God
[2062.28 → 2064.84] You answered your prayers back then
[2064.84 → 2066.84] And you will answer now
[2066.84 → 2068.84] And you will answer now
[2068.84 → 2070.84] You are the same God
[2070.84 → 2072.84] You are the same God
[2072.84 → 2074.84] You were the same God
[2074.84 → 2076.84] You were providing then
[2076.84 → 2078.84] You are providing now
[2078.84 → 2080.84] You are the same God
[2080.84 → 2092.84] You are the same God
[2092.84 → 2094.84] You are the same God
[2094.84 → 2098.84] You were a healer then
[2098.84 → 2102.84] You are a healer now
[2102.84 → 2106.84] You are a healer now
[2106.84 → 2108.84] Oh
[2136.84 → 2138.84] Oh
[2166.84 → 2168.84] Oh
[2196.84 → 2198.84] Oh
[2226.84 → 2228.84] Oh
[2228.84 → 2256.82] Good morning my name is Mike and I serve as a deacon here at the church, and we are going to take some time now to also worship through our giving, and we'll hand around some bags and such through the aisles or through the rows and if anything is undesignated in the bag that goes to the ministries of this church, but our special offering today is for resonate and that is the outreach arm of the CRS
[2256.82 → 2286.80] church, but we're actually going to do a special need that resonate has expressed we're going to give towards that today, so a couple of weeks ago pastor Chris shared about meeting Reverend Moses from the CRC Sierra Leone which is in West Africa, and he was here visiting a few of the pastors and I think we might have a few photos that Linda could put up of them meeting some of the pastors here in BC meeting Reverend Moses, and he expressed a need that the church there is experiencing so apparently the CRC church
[2286.80 → 2316.78] in Sierra Leone is one of the fastest growing churches in their country and CRC Sierra Leone spends a lot of time going out to some of the more remote committees schools churches that are growing in that area so they have a special need for a new land cruiser something that's four before they can get out to these spots and I guess some of their vehicles are a little worse for wear so someone here in the lower mainland committed I believe someone from out here committed to a $40,000 grant to help
[2316.78 → 2329.78] get them towards their $80,000 goal, so today's offering is going to go towards that need towards a new vehicle for the CRC in Sierra Leone, so thank you for giving to that need this morning
[2329.78 → 2332.20] we go to today's graduation
[2348.64 → 2352.94] we'll
[2354.28 → 2354.78] we
[2354.78 → 2356.78] in
[2356.78 → 2369.02] Here I am
[2369.02 → 2374.72] From the ends of the earth
[2374.72 → 2376.62] I'll be
