[460.82 → 462.78] Good morning, everyone.
[464.30 → 466.88] Happy Thanksgiving to everyone today.
[467.60 → 468.86] Oh, thank you.
[468.92 → 469.78] That's so kind.
[470.48 → 471.16] Thank you, Judy.
[471.80 → 477.68] It is good to be together here in this place today to worship God, to give thanks to him
[477.68 → 478.24] for all things.
[478.54 → 479.68] My name is Kevin Robert.
[479.68 → 485.86] I'm the youth pastor here at Langley Emanuel CRC. It's my pleasure, along with this worship team
[485.86 → 492.84] here behind me and others as well, to take part in this service as well. Before we get into the
[492.84 → 497.48] service, just a couple of announcements. There are a couple of dates to circle in your heads or
[497.48 → 504.26] your calendars. If you are a ministry leader or a leader of a care group, we are having a ministry
[504.26 → 510.24] and missions table meeting this coming Wednesday, starting at 7 p.m. So that information has come
[510.24 → 514.88] out. You should have received emails about that. If you've got any questions about that night, you
[514.88 → 520.20] can chat with Chris or me. We can give you more, but we will be meeting here on Wednesday at 7 p.m.
[520.20 → 527.00] for that. And then as well, not tomorrow, but the following Tuesday, October 20th, we'll be having our
[527.00 → 532.00] second Safe Church Training Day night. It'll be at night, so it's not really a day. It's just a couple
[532.00 → 537.68] hours, too, so I don't want to overhype this thing. But if you are in need of doing Safe Church
[537.68 → 543.14] Training, that is happening on Tuesday, October 20th, again, starting at 7 p.m., so please do
[543.14 → 547.74] come out for that. If you need more information, again, you can talk to either Chris or myself or
[547.74 → 553.94] Rachel here in the front. She can give you some more information about that. I'm going to invite
[553.94 → 563.44] you all to rise now and receive God's greeting this morning. God's greeting this morning comes
[563.44 → 567.50] from Revelation, where he says this,
[568.08 → 575.24] Grace and peace to you from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven
[575.24 → 580.38] spirits that are before his throne, and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness,
[580.38 → 586.48] the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth, and all of God's people
[586.48 → 591.08] said. As God has greeted us this morning, please take a moment to greet those around you.
[610.38 → 637.20] Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 148.
[637.20 → 646.48] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord from the heavens. Praise him in the heights above. Praise him,
[646.72 → 654.20] all his angels. Praise him, all his heavenly hosts. Praise him, sun and moon. Praise him,
[654.30 → 662.00] all you shining stars. Praise him, you highest heavens and you waters above the skies. Let them
[662.00 → 668.06] praise the name of the Lord. For at his command they were created, and he established them forever
[668.06 → 676.12] and ever. He issued a decree that will never pass away. Praise the Lord from the earth, you great sea
[676.12 → 683.34] creatures and all ocean depths, lightning and hail, snow and clouds, stormy winds that do his bidding.
[683.34 → 692.28] You mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars, wild animals and all cattle, small creatures and flying birds,
[693.04 → 701.22] kings of the earth and all nations, you princes and all rulers on earth, young men and women, old men and children.
[702.34 → 706.50] Let them praise the name of the Lord, for his name alone is exalted.
[706.50 → 713.04] His splendour is above the earth and the heavens. And he raised up for his people a horn,
[713.68 → 720.50] the praise of all his faithful servants of Israel, the people close to his heart. Praise the Lord.

[1131.78 → 1132.78] Amen
[1132.78 → 1150.42] Please read responsibly with me for our confession and assurance.
[1150.42 → 1155.54] What is your only comfort in life and in death?
[1155.54 → 1166.54] That I am not my home, but the Lamb of mighty and soul, in life and in death, to my faithful Saviour Jesus Christ.
[1166.54 → 1171.54] What must you know to live and die in the joy of this comfort?
[1171.54 → 1173.54] Three things.
[1173.54 → 1177.54] First, how great my sin and misery are.
[1177.54 → 1182.54] Second, how I am set free from all my sins and misery.
[1182.54 → 1189.54] Third, how I am to thank God for such deliverance.
[1189.54 → 1203.54] Faithful Lord, His mercy is more.
[1203.54 → 1207.54] Stronger the darkness, new and more.
[1207.54 → 1214.54] Our sins they are many, His mercy is more.
[1214.54 → 1226.54] What love could remember no wrongs we have done.
[1226.54 → 1231.54] All nations all knowing He has not their song.
[1231.54 → 1236.54] Thrown into a sea with a bottom or shore.
[1236.54 → 1238.54] Our sins they are many, His mercy is more.
[1238.54 → 1243.54] Our sins they are many, His mercy is more.
[1243.54 → 1255.54] What patience would wait as we constantly roam.
[1255.54 → 1260.54] What promise no tender is calling us home.
[1260.54 → 1261.54] He is the weak, His mercy is more.
[1261.54 → 1262.54] He is the weak, His mercy is more.
[1262.54 → 1267.54] Our sins they are many, His mercy is more.
[1267.54 → 1272.54] Our sins they are many, His mercy is more.
[1272.54 → 1274.54] Praise the Lord, His mercy is more.
[1274.54 → 1279.54] Praise the Lord, His mercy is more.
[1279.54 → 1284.54] Stronger the darkness, new and more.
[1284.54 → 1285.54] Our sins they are many, His mercy is more.
[1285.54 → 1291.54] Our sins they are many, His mercy is more.
[1291.54 → 1292.54] For the riches of kindness He lavished on us.
[1292.54 → 1298.54] His blood was the payment, His blood was the cost.
[1298.54 → 1299.54] We stood in the debt we could never afford.
[1299.54 → 1300.54] Our sins they are many, His mercy is more.
[1300.54 → 1301.54] Praise the Lord, His mercy is more.
[1301.54 → 1302.54] Praise the Lord, His mercy is more.
[1302.54 → 1303.54] His mercy is more.
[1303.54 → 1304.54] His mercy is more.
[1304.54 → 1307.54] His mercy is more.
[1307.54 → 1321.54] Our sins they are many, His mercy is more.
[1321.54 → 1325.54] Praise the Lord, His mercy is more.
[1325.54 → 1330.20] His mercy is more
[1330.20 → 1335.50] Stronger the darkness
[1335.50 → 1337.70] Through and before
[1337.70 → 1340.36] Our sins and our baby
[1340.36 → 1342.54] His mercy is more
[1342.54 → 1345.88] Praise the Lord
[1345.88 → 1349.62] His mercy is more
[1349.62 → 1355.00] Stronger the darkness
[1355.00 → 1357.36] New every morn
[1357.36 → 1360.10] Our sins they are heavy
[1360.10 → 1362.62] His mercy is more
[1362.62 → 1365.42] Our sins they are many
[1365.42 → 1369.22] His mercy is more
[1369.22 → 1372.26] I'm glad you can be seated
[1385.00 → 1394.34] Good morning my name is Mike, and I'm a deacon here, and we're going to take some time now to give our
[1394.34 → 1401.36] Thanks and give back in many of the ways God has given us so we'll take a moment to give of our financial offering right now and
[1401.36 → 1412.20] Just one way is of course you can give to the ministries of this church and if you want to do so there are some envelopes in the seats in front of you, or you can send an e-transfer and support the ministry there
[1412.20 → 1418.72] Anything undesignated that you give in some baskets or little bags that will go around today go towards the Langley Food Bank
[1418.72 → 1425.88] You can also give that way through e-transfer and other ways and designate it as such in like the notes or the memo
[1425.88 → 1430.58] But the Langley Food Bank is something this church has passionately partnered with for many years
[1430.72 → 1434.72] There are quite a few members of this church who volunteer there as well as we host
[1435.42 → 1440.22] We help host the annual Durbanville food bank in the summer and of course support it throughout the year
[1440.22 → 1443.88] So thank you in advance for that. So if you had brought any groceries
[1443.88 → 1450.84] It's been a bit of a tradition here on Thanksgiving weekend to bring those forward too and otherwise if you ever want to give to the food bank
[1450.84 → 1455.88] We do keep a box in the foyer that you can put your non-perishable donations in
[1456.28 → 1458.82] So thank you so much for giving to the Langley Food Bank
[1458.82 → 1464.70] They work very hard to try and supply any families or customers that come in with two days worth of groceries
[1464.70 → 1469.74] And then they also try to build relationship and bridge people into relationship with local churches
[1469.74 → 1474.32] So they are a wonderful ministry just in downtown Langley. So thank you for giving as you are able
[1474.32 → 1476.32] Oh
[1496.32 → 1498.24] My words fall
[1498.24 → 1499.24] I'm sure
[1499.24 → 1503.24] I've got nothing new
[1503.24 → 1508.24] How could I express
[1508.24 → 1512.24] All my gratitude
[1512.24 → 1516.24] I could sing these songs
[1516.24 → 1518.24] As I often do
[1518.24 → 1520.24] Every song must end
[1520.24 → 1522.24] Every song must end
[1522.24 → 1524.24] I could sing these songs
[1524.24 → 1525.24] Every song must end
[1525.24 → 1526.24] Every song must end
[1526.24 → 1527.24] Every song must end
[1527.24 → 1531.24] And you never do
[1531.24 → 1536.24] So I throw up my hands
[1536.24 → 1540.24] And praise you again and again
[1540.24 → 1543.24] All that I have
[1543.24 → 1544.24] All I have is
[1544.24 → 1545.24] All that I have is
[1545.24 → 1546.24] Hallelujah
[1547.24 → 1548.24] Hallelujah
[1548.24 → 1550.24] Hallelujah
[1550.24 → 1553.24] Hallelujah
[1553.24 → 1554.24] I know it's not much
[1554.24 → 1568.24] is
[1568.24 → 1582.24] is
[1586.00 → 1588.24] with my arms
[1598.24 → 1602.24] praising again and again
[1602.24 → 1604.24] the child that I have
[1604.24 → 1606.24] is a sign
[1606.24 → 1608.24] in
[1608.24 → 1610.24] you and I
[1610.24 → 1612.24] hallelujah
[1612.24 → 1614.24] hallelujah
[1614.24 → 1616.24] my door is not much
[1616.24 → 1618.24] but I'm nothing else
[1618.24 → 1620.24] before a key
[1620.24 → 1622.24] the second
[1622.24 → 1624.24] Lord I see
[1624.24 → 1626.24] the hallelujah
[1626.24 → 1630.24] hallelujah
[1630.24 → 1634.24] hallelujah
[1644.24 → 1646.24] my soul
[1646.24 → 1648.24] don't you get shone
[1648.24 → 1650.24] or leave your heart
[1650.24 → 1652.24] you brought a lot
[1652.24 → 1654.24] inside those lungs
[1654.24 → 1664.14] Come on, my soul.
[1664.14 → 1666.40] Come on, don't you get shy?
[1666.40 → 1668.82] I'm hearing of your song.
[1669.36 → 1673.64] Stay right by the inside of all is love.
[1674.12 → 1677.18] Come on, praise the Lord.
[1680.74 → 1682.86] Come on, my soul.
[1682.86 → 1687.46] Come to get a shine on the image of your song
[1687.46 → 1692.34] You've got a body inside those clouds
[1692.34 → 1697.54] And I pray and pray for those
[1697.54 → 1705.60] I know how the peace of the time is for the end of the day
[1705.60 → 1717.84] For the help is our Alleluia, Alleluia
[1717.84 → 1724.30] And there's not much of nothing else before He
[1724.30 → 1735.58] Except for a heart singing Alleluia, Alleluia
[1735.60 → 1744.88] I'm glad you're listening
[1744.88 → 1758.16] Good morning, everyone. If you are age three up to grade four, I'd like to invite you to come on up.
[1758.16 → 1762.78] We are going to have a little chat up here, and then we have children's worship time.
[1762.78 → 1766.38] For those, if you're visiting, you're welcome to join us as well.
[1766.38 → 1771.26] The grade one to grade fours will be coming back in time for Lord's Supper
[1771.26 → 1774.46] And the preschool and kindergartens will stay in their class the whole time.
[1774.46 → 1779.34] All right. I don't know where I'm going to sit here, I guess.
[1779.98 → 1782.06] Okay. Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.
[1782.46 → 1786.80] We're going to just do a short kids' corner today because we kind of have a busy service
[1786.80 → 1789.88] And we've got lots of stuff planned together out in children's worship time.
[1790.36 → 1794.88] We're going to be talking about what it means to give thanks to God no matter where we are.
[1794.88 → 1799.44] So, and I'm sure you can help me give some ideas of things you're thankful for.
[1799.68 → 1802.94] And we're going to learn about a man called Jeremiah in the Bible.
[1803.68 → 1806.04] So let's just stand up. We're going to get started right away.
[1806.36 → 1809.06] And we'll do our blessing and put it in our hands.
[1809.06 → 1812.88] And I'll invite the whole church to join us to give and receive a blessing as well.
[1812.88 → 1842.86] Thank you.
[1842.88 → 1851.42] Good morning, everyone.
[1852.52 → 1854.02] I'm Steve. I'm an elder here.
[1854.14 → 1857.08] And I have the honour of leading us in prayer this morning.
[1859.96 → 1862.54] Faithful God, creator of heaven and earth,
[1863.18 → 1866.26] you are the giver of every good and perfect gift.
[1866.82 → 1871.68] Today, as we gather in gratitude, we lift our hearts to you in Thanksgiving and praise.
[1871.68 → 1875.44] Lord, we thank you for the abundance of your creation,
[1876.04 → 1879.12] for the harvest gathered from the fields,
[1879.38 → 1881.24] for the beauty of the changing seasons,
[1881.64 → 1883.68] for the food that nourishes our bodies,
[1884.20 → 1887.02] and for the fellowship that nourishes our soul.
[1888.16 → 1891.44] You have been generous beyond measure,
[1891.70 → 1894.84] and we acknowledge that all we have comes from you.
[1894.84 → 1897.94] We thank you for the gift of community,
[1898.54 → 1901.14] for family and friends, for neighbours and coworkers,
[1901.64 → 1905.04] for this church family where we can worship, learn, and serve together.
[1905.04 → 1908.70] Thank you for the joy of belonging to the body of Christ,
[1908.90 → 1910.88] and for the love that binds us together.
[1912.30 → 1915.38] Gracious Father, we also bring before you the needs of our world.
[1915.98 → 1919.10] Where there is hunger, bring daily bread and lasting justice.
[1919.74 → 1921.58] Where there is conflict, bring peace.
[1921.90 → 1923.96] Where there is loneliness, bring comfort.
[1923.96 → 1926.76] And where our hearts are heavy with grief or worry,
[1927.26 → 1933.76] remind us of your promise that nothing can separate us from the love of Jesus Christ.
[1934.48 → 1938.30] We remember today those who cannot join us
[1938.30 → 1941.62] in celebrating those who are ill, those who mourn,
[1941.86 → 1943.62] those who struggle to find work or shelter.
[1944.38 → 1946.48] May our gratitude move us to compassion,
[1946.80 → 1949.12] and our Thanksgiving lead us to generosity,
[1949.12 → 1952.28] so that others may see your goodness through us.
[1954.58 → 1958.14] Lord Jesus, we thank you most of all for the gift of salvation,
[1958.54 → 1959.80] for your death and resurrection,
[1960.36 → 1962.48] that we all have given us a new life.
[1962.94 → 1965.20] Thank you for the hope that endures beyond seasons,
[1965.40 → 1968.10] and the joy of knowing that we belong, body and soul,
[1968.32 → 1971.16] in life and death, to our faithful Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[1973.34 → 1976.98] At this time, we bring before you the requests of our local church family.
[1976.98 → 1980.58] We lift to you, Rick and Sam Walters,
[1980.72 → 1983.20] and their family as they grieve the loss of Rick's niece,
[1983.34 → 1984.94] Steph, who was killed in a car accident.
[1985.70 → 1990.02] Comfort them, Lord, and especially be near Steph's five children.
[1991.14 → 1994.94] May the peace of Christ be tangible for all those who mourn her loss.
[1996.26 → 1999.16] We pray for Clary Hysteroid's sister, Carolyn,
[1999.24 → 2002.04] who was in a serious collision several weeks ago in Florida.
[2003.18 → 2005.54] Father, lay your healing hand upon her body
[2005.54 → 2007.36] and bring her full recovery and restoration.
[2009.28 → 2011.26] We continue to pray for John Buyers.
[2011.68 → 2013.40] Thank you for the care he has received,
[2013.66 → 2015.48] and we ask for clarity for his doctors.
[2016.06 → 2020.30] Grant John and Greta patients strength and hope as they await answers.
[2020.70 → 2023.56] May the treatments bring full restoration of John's health.
[2024.44 → 2025.80] And we bring before you Tessa,
[2026.04 → 2028.56] Jerry Jansen's daughter and Enema Law's sister,
[2028.68 → 2030.74] who underwent surgery this past week
[2030.74 → 2032.30] to remove cancer from her colon.
[2033.32 → 2035.58] Lord, bless her with healing and renewed strength.
[2038.28 → 2040.76] Be with Pastor Kevin as he leads us this morning,
[2040.86 → 2042.92] and we ask you to bless him and his message.
[2044.12 → 2046.78] God, accept our thanks, our praise, and our requests,
[2047.14 → 2049.62] for you are good, and your love endures forever.
[2050.16 → 2052.40] We pray this all in the name of Jesus Christ,
[2052.74 → 2055.06] your Son, and our Lord and Saviour.
[2055.52 → 2055.78] Amen.
[2055.78 → 2055.92] Amen.
[2078.92 → 2080.94] Good morning once again, everyone.
[2081.84 → 2084.10] Happy Thanksgiving to everyone here.
[2084.10 → 2089.28] We are going to be looking at a little bit of a non-traditional wedding,
[2089.48 → 2091.24] or wedding, Thanksgiving text.
[2091.50 → 2094.26] It's actually a very non-traditional wedding text as well,
[2094.42 → 2095.40] to be honest with you,
[2095.48 → 2099.20] but also a non-traditional Thanksgiving text this morning.
[2099.46 → 2102.86] And part of the reason for that is because during this sermon,
[2102.98 → 2104.82] I'm actually being evaluated by classes.
[2105.24 → 2107.84] So right now, there are three people, two people in the room,
[2107.90 → 2111.34] evaluating me, making sure I am equipped to do this type of work.
[2111.34 → 2114.20] And so classes has given me this passage to preach on,
[2114.32 → 2117.00] not knowing that I was going to be preaching on Thanksgiving Sunday.
[2117.30 → 2121.42] But God is good, because I truly, truly believe
[2121.42 → 2126.92] that even though this isn't a traditional Thanksgiving Bible text,
[2127.10 → 2129.86] it does point us, all of God's people,
[2130.36 → 2134.24] to what it means to be grateful in all circumstances.
[2135.00 → 2137.92] But before we get into this text that we're going to find in Jeremiah,
[2138.14 → 2140.46] I've got a bit of a folk tale for you.
[2140.46 → 2141.78] Now, it's not a Christian folk tale,
[2141.84 → 2144.24] but it does kind of lay a little bit of the groundwork for this sermon.
[2144.42 → 2145.86] So, some of you have heard it before.
[2146.00 → 2148.18] It's not uncommon, but it goes like this.
[2149.00 → 2152.12] There was once a farmer whose horse ran away.
[2153.14 → 2155.06] And the neighbour saw that and came out and said,
[2155.16 → 2156.98] Ah, what such bad luck.
[2157.64 → 2159.34] And the farmer shrugged his shoulders and said,
[2160.04 → 2160.34] Maybe.
[2161.42 → 2163.16] Well, three days later, the horse returned,
[2163.46 → 2166.24] and with it, he came with three wild horses as well.
[2166.24 → 2167.92] And the neighbours came out and said,
[2168.04 → 2169.64] Wow, that's amazing.
[2169.74 → 2170.44] What good luck.
[2171.36 → 2173.04] And the farmer shrugged his shoulders and said,
[2173.12 → 2173.88] Well, maybe.
[2175.14 → 2178.00] Well, then, the next day, the farmer's son was out
[2178.00 → 2180.54] trying to tame one of the wild horses that had come,
[2180.86 → 2182.76] and he fell off the horse and broke his leg.
[2183.52 → 2185.28] So the neighbours came out and rushed out and said,
[2185.36 → 2186.36] Wow, that's crazy.
[2186.46 → 2187.46] That is so unfortunate.
[2187.58 → 2188.34] What bad luck.
[2189.06 → 2191.06] And the farmer shrugged his shoulders and said,
[2191.12 → 2191.78] Well, maybe.
[2191.78 → 2191.90] Maybe.
[2193.58 → 2196.28] Later that week, soldiers came to the farm,
[2196.36 → 2199.18] and they were enlisting all the young, able-bodied men.
[2199.42 → 2201.84] They were drafting all the able-bodied young men
[2201.84 → 2204.20] to take part in a war that was happening that moment.
[2204.68 → 2208.40] And the farmer's son was disqualified because of his injury.
[2209.04 → 2210.38] So the neighbours came out and said,
[2210.48 → 2211.32] That's amazing.
[2211.46 → 2212.44] What good luck.
[2213.32 → 2214.98] And the farmer shrugged his shoulders and said,
[2215.18 → 2215.72] Maybe.
[2216.82 → 2217.72] You get the point.
[2219.24 → 2220.68] We don't see the full picture.
[2220.68 → 2226.74] We often cannot tell if our circumstances are good or bad.
[2226.86 → 2229.84] We don't have the gift of retrospect at the moment
[2229.84 → 2234.42] to see how events in our lives will actually shape our future.
[2235.76 → 2236.88] But God does.
[2238.26 → 2240.40] And today we're going to look at a text from Jeremiah
[2240.40 → 2243.20] and learn that not only does God see the whole picture,
[2244.04 → 2245.50] He ordains it.
[2246.26 → 2248.40] He has ultimate authority over it,
[2248.40 → 2252.08] and He rules over it because we believe in a big God.
[2252.70 → 2256.14] A big God whose purposes never hinge
[2256.14 → 2260.10] on luck or coincidence or a reaction.
[2261.12 → 2264.64] That's the God Jeremiah is going to call us to remember today.
[2264.78 → 2266.46] That we don't worship a bigger God
[2266.46 → 2270.32] who tries to fix or work within the context that we find ourselves,
[2270.32 → 2272.34] but we worship a big God
[2272.34 → 2275.14] who ordains and rules over every moment,
[2275.78 → 2277.76] who carries His people into exile,
[2278.06 → 2280.14] through exile, and home again.
[2280.20 → 2281.56] So let's read our passage this morning.
[2281.82 → 2285.06] We're going to look at Jeremiah 29, verses 1 to 7.
[2285.50 → 2287.14] I encourage you, as always,
[2287.20 → 2288.60] if you have a Bible with you,
[2289.02 → 2291.02] open it up and follow along.
[2291.10 → 2291.84] I also encourage you,
[2291.88 → 2292.90] if you've got a Bible app,
[2292.94 → 2293.70] that works as well.
[2293.76 → 2295.00] So just have those open with you
[2295.00 → 2296.78] because we're going to be looking back at this text
[2296.78 → 2298.92] and then elsewhere throughout this message.
[2299.82 → 2303.28] So Jeremiah 29, verses 1 to 7 says this.
[2303.78 → 2306.14] This is the text of the letter
[2306.14 → 2308.56] that the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem
[2308.56 → 2311.48] to the surviving elders among the exiles
[2311.48 → 2312.34] and to the priests,
[2312.84 → 2313.38] the prophets,
[2313.82 → 2315.70] and all the people Nebuchadnezzar
[2315.70 → 2317.98] had carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.
[2318.90 → 2322.42] This was after King Joachim and the Queen Mother,
[2322.60 → 2323.28] the court officials,
[2323.48 → 2325.06] and the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem,
[2325.06 → 2327.12] the skilled workers and the artisans
[2327.12 → 2328.80] had gone into exile from Jerusalem.
[2329.56 → 2331.98] He entrusted the letter to Elisha,
[2332.18 → 2333.04] son of Shaft,
[2333.68 → 2336.12] and to Jemima, son of William,
[2336.32 → 2337.68] whom Zedekiah, king of Judah,
[2337.82 → 2339.92] sent to King Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon.
[2340.84 → 2341.40] And it said,
[2342.06 → 2344.42] This is what the Lord Almighty,
[2344.58 → 2345.46] the God of Israel,
[2345.58 → 2347.72] says to all those I carried into exile
[2347.72 → 2349.04] from Jerusalem to Babylon.
[2349.42 → 2351.48] Build houses and settle down.
[2351.96 → 2353.88] Plant gardens and eat what they produce.
[2353.88 → 2355.78] Marry and have sons and daughters.
[2356.16 → 2357.82] Find wives for your sons
[2357.82 → 2359.62] and give your daughters in marriage
[2359.62 → 2362.06] so they too may have sons and daughters.
[2362.74 → 2363.94] Increase in number there.
[2364.50 → 2365.54] Do not decrease.
[2366.42 → 2369.06] Also seek the peace and prosperity of the city
[2369.06 → 2371.32] to which I have carried you into exile.
[2371.92 → 2373.20] Pray to the Lord for it
[2373.20 → 2374.56] because if it prospers,
[2375.02 → 2376.80] you too will prosper.
[2377.54 → 2378.92] This is the word of the Lord.
[2378.92 → 2383.24] So what's happening here?
[2384.24 → 2386.04] Well, this letter that Jeremiah wrote
[2386.04 → 2389.04] was likely written around 597 BC,
[2389.32 → 2391.64] which was shortly after God's people,
[2391.90 → 2393.62] the people living in the land of Judah,
[2394.14 → 2396.60] were taken over by the nation of Babylon.
[2397.54 → 2399.56] All right, this was after the first wave
[2399.56 → 2402.74] of Jewish exiles from Judah to Babylon took place.
[2402.74 → 2405.52] And so Jeremiah is writing this letter
[2405.52 → 2408.36] to a people who are now living in a foreign land
[2408.36 → 2411.34] under the rule of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon.
[2411.58 → 2412.96] They're far away from home.
[2413.70 → 2415.16] They're living under foreign rule.
[2415.26 → 2416.42] They're in a distant land
[2416.42 → 2419.36] and God gets Jeremiah to reach out.
[2420.76 → 2425.04] This letter was God's word to his people in exile.
[2425.04 → 2427.80] And this Thanksgiving Sunday,
[2427.90 → 2429.28] the big idea from this message,
[2429.38 → 2431.76] the big idea comes straight out of this letter
[2431.76 → 2432.92] that God spoke through Jeremiah.
[2433.08 → 2434.20] And that big idea is this,
[2434.74 → 2438.42] that God's people are strangers and foreigners
[2438.42 → 2440.92] who are called to settle in
[2440.92 → 2443.06] and be thankful where we are.
[2443.76 → 2445.90] God's people are strangers and foreigners
[2445.90 → 2447.62] who are called to settle in
[2447.62 → 2450.32] and be thankful wherever we are.
[2452.08 → 2453.92] God speaks this through this word.
[2453.92 → 2454.82] Make no mistake,
[2455.12 → 2456.78] this letter that Jeremiah writes,
[2456.84 → 2459.06] this is God's word to his people.
[2459.46 → 2461.74] Jeremiah makes that abundantly clear in verse four
[2461.74 → 2462.30] where it says,
[2462.86 → 2464.08] this is what the Lord Almighty,
[2464.20 → 2465.30] the God of Israel says.
[2467.30 → 2468.62] Now again, God's people were captured.
[2468.94 → 2470.14] They were taken from their homes.
[2470.52 → 2473.08] God's temple back in Jerusalem was destroyed.
[2473.48 → 2475.00] They were in an unfamiliar land.
[2475.10 → 2477.46] They were 800 miles away
[2477.46 → 2479.48] with more questions about
[2479.48 → 2480.94] what was going to be happening next.
[2482.08 → 2483.56] Things were not looking good.
[2483.92 → 2487.92] Some of them likely thought that God had abandoned them
[2487.92 → 2489.92] or maybe had even died along with his temple.
[2491.82 → 2494.20] But then God speaks to them through this letter.
[2495.60 → 2496.68] God was not dead.
[2496.78 → 2498.30] He was not distant or left behind.
[2498.42 → 2499.78] God was not far away.
[2500.12 → 2501.02] He was with them.
[2502.16 → 2504.74] He was right there speaking to them.
[2504.80 → 2505.38] He was present.
[2505.38 → 2508.06] This letter from Jeremiah,
[2508.06 → 2510.60] this word of God was huge for God's people
[2510.60 → 2513.36] because even though they were in exile,
[2513.88 → 2516.38] God was not some distant idea
[2516.38 → 2520.02] off in Jerusalem waiting for them to return.
[2521.22 → 2522.44] He was there.
[2522.68 → 2523.58] He was with them,
[2523.90 → 2524.64] speaking to them,
[2524.80 → 2526.90] revealing himself to them.
[2526.90 → 2530.76] And that same word of God
[2530.76 → 2534.10] is the word that we have access to every day.
[2534.66 → 2536.56] That same word that we open here
[2536.56 → 2537.86] every Sunday in church.
[2538.18 → 2540.36] That same word that Josh tells us to read
[2540.36 → 2541.96] every week on the podcast.
[2542.48 → 2544.86] That same word that a number of us
[2544.86 → 2545.64] in this congregation
[2545.64 → 2547.18] are reading through together
[2547.18 → 2548.50] for the next three years.
[2548.50 → 2552.74] God reveals himself in it.
[2553.40 → 2554.74] He is active, not distant.
[2554.84 → 2555.48] He is speaking.
[2555.62 → 2556.46] He's not silent.
[2556.70 → 2558.82] He is present no matter where we are.
[2561.80 → 2562.92] Sometimes I hear people say,
[2562.96 → 2564.44] and maybe you have heard this too,
[2564.74 → 2566.94] that the Bible is not necessarily relevant
[2566.94 → 2568.02] to us anymore,
[2568.16 → 2570.12] at least not as relevant to us anymore
[2570.12 → 2572.06] because it was written so long ago.
[2574.26 → 2576.54] But just like God's people here in Jeremiah,
[2576.54 → 2579.22] distance does not separate us from God.
[2579.58 → 2580.44] God's people, yes,
[2580.52 → 2582.56] they were 800 miles away from their home,
[2582.70 → 2583.70] but God was with them.
[2583.96 → 2586.06] Yes, we are 2,000 years away
[2586.06 → 2588.24] from when Jesus walked and lived on this earth,
[2588.78 → 2590.94] but he is still active and speaking
[2590.94 → 2592.24] and present with us
[2592.24 → 2594.50] because his word speaks.
[2594.84 → 2596.06] God's word speaks.
[2596.40 → 2597.50] He is right here.
[2598.72 → 2600.04] He is right here.
[2601.16 → 2602.52] This is the foundation
[2602.52 → 2604.28] and the authority of our lives.
[2604.36 → 2605.88] And when we dig into this book,
[2606.54 → 2608.38] when we read its words,
[2609.18 → 2611.68] we allow the metanarrative
[2611.68 → 2613.10] of God's redemption story
[2613.10 → 2614.42] to take root in our hearts
[2614.42 → 2616.38] and then we start to realize
[2616.38 → 2618.54] how much of God's story
[2618.54 → 2620.98] continues on with us,
[2621.08 → 2622.44] with me, with you.
[2623.54 → 2624.94] It forms us.
[2625.02 → 2626.00] It challenges us.
[2626.08 → 2626.86] It shapes us.
[2627.02 → 2628.52] And it points us right back to him.
[2628.52 → 2632.52] That's what Jeremiah's letter was doing
[2632.52 → 2634.56] for God's people in Babylon.
[2635.48 → 2637.40] It was getting them to understand
[2637.40 → 2638.90] that he was still with them
[2638.90 → 2641.06] even in trying times.
[2643.50 → 2645.52] But it was more than that, actually.
[2647.38 → 2648.66] Take a close look here
[2648.66 → 2649.86] at verse 4 with me again.
[2651.22 → 2652.04] It says this,
[2652.04 → 2653.48] this is what the Lord Almighty,
[2653.60 → 2654.38] the God of Israel,
[2654.52 → 2654.90] says,
[2655.62 → 2657.44] to all those I carried
[2657.44 → 2658.32] into exile
[2658.32 → 2660.20] from Jerusalem to Babylon.
[2660.74 → 2661.38] Did you catch that?
[2662.02 → 2663.12] Look at verse 7 as well.
[2664.18 → 2664.62] Also,
[2665.46 → 2666.28] seek the peace
[2666.28 → 2666.98] and prosperity
[2666.98 → 2667.78] of the city.
[2667.96 → 2668.90] I just moved.
[2669.38 → 2670.58] Also, seek the peace
[2670.58 → 2671.26] and prosperity
[2671.26 → 2671.92] of the city
[2671.92 → 2674.28] to which I have carried
[2674.28 → 2675.62] you into exile.
[2675.62 → 2679.24] All those I carried
[2679.24 → 2679.98] to exile
[2679.98 → 2682.86] to which I have carried
[2682.86 → 2684.58] you to exile.
[2686.20 → 2688.54] See, in God's redemption story,
[2688.90 → 2689.96] the story that you and I
[2689.96 → 2690.82] are a part of,
[2692.04 → 2693.58] his plans often carry
[2693.58 → 2694.72] times of turmoil.
[2696.38 → 2696.84] But here,
[2696.98 → 2697.80] God's authority
[2697.80 → 2700.16] and rule over his people
[2700.16 → 2702.40] included exile.
[2703.34 → 2704.90] I carried you
[2704.90 → 2706.24] into exile
[2706.24 → 2707.90] is what it says.
[2709.14 → 2709.90] God's sovereignty,
[2710.08 → 2711.20] his absolute right
[2711.20 → 2711.70] and power
[2711.70 → 2713.10] to rule over the cosmos
[2713.10 → 2715.08] ordained this exile
[2715.08 → 2715.94] to happen.
[2716.12 → 2716.98] Let that sink in
[2716.98 → 2717.60] for a second.
[2720.38 → 2720.86] I know it's not
[2720.86 → 2721.76] our usual cozy
[2721.76 → 2723.18] Thanksgiving sermon point here,
[2723.26 → 2724.94] but God ordained
[2724.94 → 2726.56] this trying time
[2726.56 → 2727.64] for his people.
[2728.64 → 2729.60] He ordained it.
[2729.66 → 2730.44] He appointed it.
[2730.50 → 2731.44] He arranged it
[2731.44 → 2732.24] to happen.
[2733.44 → 2734.02] And this is not
[2734.02 → 2735.04] an isolated incident
[2735.04 → 2735.60] in scripture.
[2735.74 → 2736.68] Just like God
[2736.68 → 2738.02] ordained the Israelites
[2738.02 → 2739.04] to wander the desert
[2739.04 → 2739.82] for 40 years
[2739.82 → 2740.22] in Exodus.
[2740.60 → 2741.56] Just like God
[2741.56 → 2742.98] ordained the suffering
[2742.98 → 2743.50] of Job
[2743.50 → 2744.18] in the entirety
[2744.18 → 2744.76] of his book.
[2745.02 → 2746.14] Just like God
[2746.14 → 2747.54] ordained the famine
[2747.54 → 2748.86] that drove Jacob
[2748.86 → 2749.52] and his family
[2749.52 → 2750.22] to Egypt
[2750.22 → 2751.12] to escape.
[2751.36 → 2752.34] And just like God
[2752.34 → 2753.98] ordained in that same story
[2753.98 → 2755.24] all the suffering
[2755.24 → 2756.26] and turmoil
[2756.26 → 2757.74] that Joseph went to
[2757.74 → 2760.42] to get where he was at
[2760.42 → 2762.08] as an outcast
[2762.08 → 2762.82] and a slave
[2762.82 → 2763.68] and a prisoner.
[2764.72 → 2766.10] God ordained it all.
[2767.56 → 2768.70] And so much more
[2768.70 → 2769.20] in scripture.
[2769.96 → 2770.66] And yet we can learn
[2770.66 → 2771.28] from that story
[2771.28 → 2773.10] in Genesis as well
[2773.10 → 2773.80] about Joseph.
[2774.02 → 2775.84] In Genesis 50 verse 20,
[2776.14 → 2777.00] despite the suffering,
[2777.14 → 2778.22] despite all the turmoil
[2778.22 → 2779.56] that Joseph went through,
[2780.88 → 2781.86] he meets his brothers
[2781.86 → 2783.30] who sold him into slavery
[2783.30 → 2784.58] towards the end
[2784.58 → 2784.92] of his life
[2784.92 → 2785.64] and he says this,
[2785.64 → 2786.74] what you intended
[2786.74 → 2787.42] for evil,
[2788.42 → 2790.00] God intended
[2790.00 → 2790.64] for good
[2790.64 → 2791.30] to accomplish
[2791.30 → 2792.46] what is now being done,
[2792.76 → 2793.24] the saving
[2793.24 → 2794.08] of many lives.
[2796.74 → 2797.86] God works
[2797.86 → 2799.00] through everything
[2799.00 → 2799.84] he ordains
[2799.84 → 2801.58] and he ordains
[2801.58 → 2802.16] everything.
[2805.04 → 2806.42] His revelation
[2806.42 → 2807.36] throughout scripture
[2807.36 → 2808.18] points us
[2808.18 → 2809.00] to this sovereignty,
[2809.22 → 2810.16] his ruling
[2810.16 → 2811.34] over all things.
[2811.66 → 2812.46] This is big
[2812.46 → 2813.94] God theology.
[2814.62 → 2815.38] Like we talked about
[2815.38 → 2815.94] in the opening.
[2816.96 → 2818.08] God isn't just working
[2818.08 → 2819.96] within the exile
[2819.96 → 2821.86] or using the exile
[2821.86 → 2823.42] that just so happened
[2823.42 → 2824.94] to be thrust upon
[2824.94 → 2825.62] his people
[2825.62 → 2827.08] for his kingdom purposes.
[2827.46 → 2828.60] God wasn't simply
[2828.60 → 2829.70] just bigger
[2829.70 → 2831.04] than the exile
[2831.04 → 2833.36] or able to use
[2833.36 → 2834.02] the exile
[2834.02 → 2834.88] that so happened
[2834.88 → 2836.34] for his kingdom purposes.
[2837.38 → 2838.60] The exile
[2838.60 → 2839.62] was his purpose.
[2840.08 → 2841.26] The exile itself
[2841.26 → 2842.40] was purposed by him.
[2842.48 → 2843.28] He ordained it
[2843.28 → 2844.56] and he utilized it
[2844.56 → 2845.58] for his kingdom purposes.
[2847.32 → 2848.30] That's the shift.
[2849.94 → 2850.40] Now,
[2850.60 → 2851.26] put yourself
[2851.26 → 2852.32] in the shoes
[2852.32 → 2852.98] of the Israelites
[2852.98 → 2853.60] for just a minute.
[2853.82 → 2854.66] You've just been taken
[2854.66 → 2855.34] from your home.
[2855.64 → 2856.36] You've just marched
[2856.36 → 2857.74] miles away.
[2858.38 → 2859.10] You've been dropped
[2859.10 → 2859.88] in a foreign land.
[2859.98 → 2860.82] You've been surrounded
[2860.82 → 2861.92] by pagan idols
[2861.92 → 2862.90] and strange customs.
[2863.46 → 2864.46] Everything in you
[2864.46 → 2865.42] would want to try
[2865.42 → 2866.08] to fight back
[2866.08 → 2866.74] against this.
[2868.30 → 2869.18] To resist.
[2870.40 → 2871.04] To say,
[2871.04 → 2871.52] no way.
[2872.36 → 2873.58] This can't be part
[2873.58 → 2874.10] of the plan.
[2874.92 → 2875.84] There is no way
[2875.84 → 2877.14] God wants this for me.
[2879.88 → 2880.52] And yet,
[2880.60 → 2881.36] Jeremiah's letter
[2881.36 → 2882.28] tells them otherwise.
[2884.20 → 2885.16] Jeremiah tells them
[2885.16 → 2886.20] something shocking,
[2886.34 → 2886.62] actually.
[2886.68 → 2887.28] He says this.
[2887.34 → 2887.68] He says,
[2888.20 → 2888.80] settle in.
[2889.94 → 2890.78] Build houses.
[2891.52 → 2892.24] Plant gardens.
[2892.42 → 2893.20] Raise families.
[2893.66 → 2894.84] Seek the peace
[2894.84 → 2895.82] of the city.
[2895.82 → 2898.06] Now,
[2898.10 → 2898.54] that's likely
[2898.54 → 2899.50] not what God's people
[2899.50 → 2900.18] wanted to hear.
[2901.36 → 2902.60] Their natural instinct
[2902.60 → 2903.02] would have been
[2903.02 → 2904.02] to start an uprising,
[2904.16 → 2905.12] to try and escape.
[2905.20 → 2905.80] And if you read
[2905.80 → 2906.74] later on in the story,
[2907.00 → 2907.74] you see that's actually
[2907.74 → 2908.54] what ends up happening.
[2909.04 → 2909.98] But Jeremiah says,
[2910.08 → 2910.20] no.
[2910.84 → 2911.78] Don't fight it.
[2913.26 → 2913.94] God's the one
[2913.94 → 2914.78] who carried you here.
[2914.86 → 2915.86] This is his plan.
[2916.36 → 2917.14] And you're going
[2917.14 → 2918.02] to be here a while.
[2918.76 → 2919.58] So settle in.
[2920.84 → 2921.46] Settle in
[2921.46 → 2922.00] where you are.
[2922.82 → 2923.06] You see,
[2923.14 → 2924.12] to resist Babylon
[2924.12 → 2924.84] here was going
[2924.84 → 2925.60] to be resisting
[2925.60 → 2926.42] God.
[2927.76 → 2928.74] Jeremiah 27,
[2928.88 → 2929.66] Ezekiel 17,
[2929.78 → 2930.44] elsewhere say
[2930.44 → 2931.02] the same thing.
[2931.10 → 2931.68] This exile
[2931.68 → 2932.52] wasn't a mistake.
[2935.08 → 2935.98] It was something,
[2936.80 → 2937.04] sorry,
[2937.12 → 2938.06] it wasn't something
[2938.06 → 2938.74] unexpected
[2938.74 → 2939.70] that God then
[2939.70 → 2940.56] had to try to fix.
[2941.50 → 2942.64] It was God's plan
[2942.64 → 2943.26] the whole time.
[2945.52 → 2946.00] Now,
[2946.00 → 2946.80] we here
[2946.80 → 2948.02] aren't in exile
[2948.02 → 2949.80] like Israel was.
[2950.82 → 2951.88] But we do
[2951.88 → 2952.74] often
[2952.74 → 2953.42] go through
[2953.42 → 2953.84] hardship
[2953.84 → 2954.58] and injustice
[2954.58 → 2955.56] and confusion
[2955.56 → 2956.42] and despair.
[2956.56 → 2956.98] We hurt
[2956.98 → 2958.00] and we mourn
[2958.00 → 2958.82] and we grieve
[2958.82 → 2959.30] and we just
[2959.30 → 2960.08] prayed for a whole
[2960.08 → 2961.00] handful of things
[2961.00 → 2962.18] that we all struggle
[2962.18 → 2963.08] with and there was
[2963.08 → 2963.90] a lot of things
[2963.90 → 2964.80] we couldn't pray for
[2964.80 → 2965.70] because they're unknown
[2965.70 → 2967.10] that we know we deal with.
[2969.54 → 2970.68] We want to fix things.
[2970.76 → 2971.40] We want to escape.
[2971.54 → 2972.20] We want to rebel.
[2972.34 → 2973.36] We want to take control.
[2973.56 → 2974.26] We grieve
[2974.26 → 2975.00] and we mourn
[2975.00 → 2975.72] and there are times
[2975.72 → 2976.56] that we assume
[2976.56 → 2977.56] God couldn't have
[2977.56 → 2978.64] purposely orchestrated.
[2979.16 → 2980.04] Times that we might
[2980.04 → 2980.76] assume
[2980.76 → 2982.24] that surprised God
[2982.24 → 2983.12] just as much
[2983.12 → 2984.18] as they surprised us.
[2986.58 → 2987.86] And that makes sense
[2987.86 → 2990.56] because times are hard
[2990.56 → 2992.14] and times hurt.
[2994.36 → 2995.36] But also,
[2995.52 → 2996.50] when we start
[2996.50 → 2997.40] thinking that way,
[2998.42 → 2999.78] that the hard times
[2999.78 → 3000.96] that we are experiencing
[3000.96 → 3002.64] are surprising God
[3002.64 → 3003.48] as much as they're
[3003.48 → 3004.48] surprising us,
[3005.16 → 3007.84] even when we ask God
[3007.84 → 3008.80] to get us out of them,
[3008.80 → 3011.36] we are thinking of a God
[3011.36 → 3012.20] that is merely bigger
[3012.20 → 3013.22] than our circumstances,
[3014.06 → 3015.68] not a big God
[3015.68 → 3016.34] who is sovereign
[3016.34 → 3017.48] and ruling over them all.
[3019.10 → 3020.52] See, bigger God theology
[3020.52 → 3021.36] means we think God
[3021.36 → 3021.92] can overcome
[3021.92 → 3023.28] the circumstances we're in,
[3023.42 → 3024.06] but that's not
[3024.06 → 3024.82] the God of Scripture.
[3025.22 → 3025.96] The God of Scripture
[3025.96 → 3027.04] is a big God
[3027.04 → 3028.74] and big God theology
[3028.74 → 3030.28] means we understand
[3030.28 → 3031.74] that God ordains
[3031.74 → 3033.12] all of our circumstances
[3033.12 → 3034.44] and uses them
[3034.44 → 3035.48] for His glory.
[3036.24 → 3037.02] Do you see the difference?
[3038.80 → 3041.00] Many of you have heard
[3041.00 → 3041.88] this story before,
[3042.06 → 3043.16] but when I was in grade 12,
[3043.28 → 3044.66] I was in a school bus accident.
[3045.44 → 3047.24] We were going down Highway 1
[3047.24 → 3048.40] and we rolled into the ditch
[3048.40 → 3049.64] and spun around a little bit
[3049.64 → 3051.12] and those buses
[3051.12 → 3051.84] don't have seat bolts,
[3051.94 → 3052.42] so it was quite
[3052.42 → 3053.46] the tumbling situation.
[3054.10 → 3055.44] I ended up with tissue damage
[3055.44 → 3056.84] in my back and shoulders
[3056.84 → 3057.88] and my soccer season
[3057.88 → 3059.44] ended right then and there
[3059.44 → 3060.96] and it halted any chance
[3060.96 → 3061.44] that I had
[3061.44 → 3062.26] at getting a scholarship
[3062.26 → 3063.20] for any university
[3063.20 → 3064.70] that was checking out
[3064.70 → 3065.32] what I was doing.
[3065.74 → 3066.48] At the time,
[3066.54 → 3067.58] I was furious with God.
[3068.80 → 3069.24] At the time,
[3069.28 → 3069.56] I was like,
[3069.60 → 3070.54] God, what are you doing here?
[3071.18 → 3072.32] How could you let this happen?
[3072.44 → 3073.06] How are you going to
[3073.06 → 3073.90] get me through this?
[3076.04 → 3076.70] But I didn't get
[3076.70 → 3077.20] any scholarship,
[3077.44 → 3078.08] so I didn't get to go
[3078.08 → 3078.80] to a university
[3078.80 → 3079.70] that was seeking me out.
[3079.90 → 3080.96] I struggled in Edmonton
[3080.96 → 3081.82] for a whole gap year
[3081.82 → 3082.52] because of that
[3082.52 → 3083.32] and then on a whim,
[3083.42 → 3084.06] I went to Redeemer
[3084.06 → 3085.86] where I met my wife,
[3086.50 → 3087.08] where I got interested
[3087.08 → 3087.64] in theology,
[3088.36 → 3088.96] where God started
[3088.96 → 3090.02] pulling me into youth ministry,
[3090.46 → 3091.42] where now I have this job
[3091.42 → 3092.40] and I'm standing before you.
[3092.82 → 3093.60] That doesn't happen
[3093.60 → 3094.56] without that bus crash.
[3094.56 → 3097.72] We don't know
[3097.72 → 3098.50] what God is doing.
[3102.68 → 3103.62] Now, I have the gift
[3103.62 → 3104.18] of retrospect
[3104.18 → 3105.08] and God has blessed me
[3105.08 → 3106.00] with that story to tell,
[3106.06 → 3107.42] but not all of our suffering
[3107.42 → 3108.84] gets those gifts
[3108.84 → 3109.84] and I understand that.
[3110.50 → 3112.82] But can we trust God
[3112.82 → 3113.82] with what we are going
[3113.82 → 3114.36] through anyway?
[3114.36 → 3116.58] Do we have
[3116.58 → 3118.56] big God theology
[3118.56 → 3120.84] or just bigger
[3120.84 → 3122.02] God theology?
[3123.86 → 3125.00] Romans 8, 28
[3125.00 → 3125.58] reminds us,
[3125.66 → 3126.26] in all things,
[3126.36 → 3127.12] God works for the good
[3127.12 → 3127.90] of those who love Him.
[3128.34 → 3129.26] And James 1 says
[3129.26 → 3131.44] to consider it pure joy
[3131.44 → 3132.78] when you face trials
[3132.78 → 3134.16] because those very trials
[3134.16 → 3135.44] produce perseverance
[3135.44 → 3137.58] and maturity in us.
[3137.62 → 3138.08] In other words,
[3138.34 → 3139.18] God doesn't just work
[3139.18 → 3140.64] around the hard times.
[3141.48 → 3142.70] He's working by
[3142.70 → 3143.68] the hard times
[3143.68 → 3144.84] because of them.
[3145.60 → 3146.12] He's doing that
[3146.12 → 3147.20] for us and for Him.
[3147.20 → 3148.86] That's what it means
[3148.86 → 3150.52] to believe in big God,
[3150.68 → 3151.46] the kind of God
[3151.46 → 3152.30] who reigns over
[3152.30 → 3154.08] both blessings and exile,
[3154.42 → 3156.08] both comfort and suffering.
[3156.28 → 3156.88] He is using
[3156.88 → 3158.80] every single bit of it
[3158.80 → 3160.14] to shape His people
[3160.14 → 3161.16] for His glory.
[3161.92 → 3163.12] And we are to trust
[3163.12 → 3164.76] and give thanks to Him
[3164.76 → 3165.72] because we know
[3165.72 → 3166.92] He loves us
[3166.92 → 3168.08] more than we'll ever understand.
[3170.00 → 3171.26] We can thank Him
[3171.26 → 3172.22] for everything,
[3173.72 → 3174.74] even the stuff
[3174.74 → 3175.82] we can't really imagine.
[3177.20 → 3178.12] like our suffering,
[3179.04 → 3180.26] like our loneliness,
[3180.52 → 3181.14] like our grief.
[3181.46 → 3182.72] Can you believe
[3182.72 → 3184.14] in a God that big?
[3185.56 → 3186.94] Can you give thanks
[3186.94 → 3189.02] to a God that big?
[3193.08 → 3194.28] So what are we to do?
[3194.96 → 3195.46] Well, once again,
[3195.52 → 3198.60] look at verses 5, 6, and 7
[3198.60 → 3199.18] with me,
[3199.24 → 3199.98] and everyone all at once.
[3200.04 → 3200.78] 6, 7.
[3201.00 → 3201.92] Ben, don't write that down
[3201.92 → 3202.50] in your evaluation.
[3202.50 → 3208.00] Let's look at verses 5 to 7
[3208.00 → 3209.20] with me here of our text.
[3210.76 → 3213.44] Build houses and settle down.
[3214.58 → 3215.50] Plant gardens
[3215.50 → 3217.16] and eat what they produce.
[3218.28 → 3220.50] Marry and have sons and daughters.
[3220.74 → 3222.26] Find wives for your sons
[3222.26 → 3223.20] and give your daughters
[3223.20 → 3223.76] in marriage
[3223.76 → 3224.92] so that they too
[3224.92 → 3226.14] may have sons and daughters.
[3226.62 → 3228.12] Increase in number there.
[3228.48 → 3229.52] Do not decrease.
[3229.52 → 3231.76] Also, seek the peace
[3231.76 → 3233.26] and prosperity of the city
[3233.26 → 3234.98] because if it prospers,
[3235.34 → 3236.42] you too will prosper.
[3237.36 → 3238.66] See, in our text today,
[3239.40 → 3240.76] God's people were foreigners.
[3240.94 → 3242.02] They're exiled in Babylon,
[3242.22 → 3242.74] and yet,
[3243.18 → 3244.12] they are called
[3244.12 → 3245.44] to live fully.
[3246.92 → 3248.36] They were to build houses
[3248.36 → 3249.54] and plant gardens.
[3250.34 → 3251.70] They were to marry each other
[3251.70 → 3252.90] and raise up a family
[3252.90 → 3253.64] and contribute
[3253.64 → 3256.00] to the Babylonian society.
[3256.00 → 3258.54] According to God,
[3258.60 → 3259.80] they were going to be there a while,
[3260.00 → 3261.26] and so while they were there,
[3261.34 → 3262.74] they were to roll up their sleeves,
[3263.16 → 3264.00] live their life,
[3264.66 → 3265.42] fill the earth,
[3265.52 → 3266.38] grow in number,
[3266.46 → 3267.70] and work for the good of creation
[3267.70 → 3268.30] and for Babylon.
[3268.58 → 3269.64] And in many ways,
[3270.56 → 3272.00] God is calling his people
[3272.00 → 3272.52] right here
[3272.52 → 3273.98] back to the very first command
[3273.98 → 3274.44] and blessing
[3274.44 → 3274.96] that he gave
[3274.96 → 3275.80] way back in Genesis.
[3276.58 → 3278.26] In Genesis 1, verse 28,
[3278.58 → 3280.30] after he creates male and female
[3280.30 → 3281.24] in his own image,
[3281.24 → 3283.20] he says to Adam and Eve this.
[3283.34 → 3283.56] He says,
[3283.80 → 3284.84] Be fruitful and multiply
[3284.84 → 3286.08] and fill the earth
[3286.08 → 3286.68] and subdue it
[3286.68 → 3287.64] and have dominion
[3287.64 → 3288.70] over the fish of the sea
[3288.70 → 3289.60] and over the birds
[3289.60 → 3290.18] of the heavens
[3290.18 → 3291.68] and over every living thing
[3291.68 → 3292.52] that moves on earth.
[3293.76 → 3295.64] See, right after creation,
[3295.76 → 3296.96] God says to Adam and Eve,
[3297.36 → 3298.40] Be fruitful and multiply.
[3299.80 → 3300.32] Get married,
[3300.42 → 3300.88] have kids,
[3301.00 → 3301.70] plant gardens,
[3301.86 → 3302.56] have dominion
[3302.56 → 3303.30] over the earth.
[3304.36 → 3304.84] Contribute.
[3306.62 → 3308.28] And the core of this Genesis text
[3308.28 → 3309.54] is what we Reformed folks
[3309.54 → 3310.12] like to call
[3310.12 → 3311.56] the creational mandate.
[3312.74 → 3314.24] It's about creating
[3314.24 → 3315.68] and cultivating
[3315.68 → 3317.32] and ruling over creation
[3317.32 → 3318.56] under God's authority.
[3318.80 → 3319.90] Not to abuse it,
[3320.56 → 3321.62] but to care for it
[3321.62 → 3323.80] and to cultivate creation
[3323.80 → 3325.00] and to participate
[3325.00 → 3325.82] in the culture
[3325.82 → 3326.80] that we are part of
[3326.80 → 3327.48] and to reflect
[3327.48 → 3328.90] God's reign
[3328.90 → 3330.34] over all things
[3330.34 → 3331.42] and lives
[3331.42 → 3332.42] here on earth.
[3334.22 → 3335.20] Now this pattern
[3335.20 → 3335.92] actually continues
[3335.92 → 3336.60] through Genesis.
[3336.80 → 3337.50] God tells Noah
[3337.50 → 3338.14] after the flood
[3338.14 → 3339.54] in Genesis 9, 1
[3339.54 → 3340.10] to be fruitful
[3340.10 → 3340.70] and multiply
[3340.70 → 3341.94] and fill the earth,
[3341.94 → 3342.48] calling him
[3342.48 → 3344.28] to preserve life
[3344.28 → 3344.90] in this world.
[3345.46 → 3346.80] Later in Genesis 12
[3346.80 → 3347.58] with Abraham,
[3347.92 → 3348.92] God promises Abraham
[3348.92 → 3349.78] that his descendants
[3349.78 → 3350.46] are going to grow
[3350.46 → 3351.68] and they will be a blessing
[3351.68 → 3352.86] to all nations.
[3353.24 → 3353.88] So with Adam,
[3353.98 → 3354.54] they're to create
[3354.54 → 3355.34] and have dominion.
[3355.80 → 3356.38] With Noah,
[3356.50 → 3357.86] they're to preserve life
[3357.86 → 3358.74] and enact justice.
[3359.00 → 3359.88] And with Abraham,
[3360.66 → 3361.46] they're to be a blessing
[3361.46 → 3362.48] to all nations.
[3363.82 → 3365.12] And here with Jeremiah,
[3365.28 → 3366.16] God is reminding
[3366.16 → 3367.16] his people
[3367.16 → 3368.54] that that is still
[3368.54 → 3369.00] the plan.
[3369.00 → 3370.94] even with them
[3370.94 → 3371.54] in exile.
[3372.62 → 3373.20] And actually,
[3373.34 → 3374.32] perhaps especially
[3374.32 → 3375.36] when they're in exile.
[3376.70 → 3378.20] Because they were displaced,
[3378.52 → 3379.24] they were to remember
[3379.24 → 3380.52] who rules over them
[3380.52 → 3382.16] and what God
[3382.16 → 3382.84] had called them
[3382.84 → 3383.80] to do from the beginning,
[3384.60 → 3386.20] which was settled in,
[3387.02 → 3387.76] plant gardens,
[3388.22 → 3389.50] contribute to society,
[3389.74 → 3390.72] and grow in number.
[3393.70 → 3395.14] Maybe you're sitting here today
[3395.14 → 3397.04] and you're asking yourself,
[3397.14 → 3397.60] okay, so what?
[3397.60 → 3399.06] What does this have to do
[3399.06 → 3400.80] with Langley Emanuel CRC
[3400.80 → 3403.30] on Thanksgiving Sunday 2025?
[3405.70 → 3406.46] Well, God's word
[3406.46 → 3407.44] makes it very clear
[3407.44 → 3409.32] that this has everything
[3409.32 → 3410.36] to do with us.
[3411.34 → 3412.66] Because we too,
[3412.96 → 3414.38] everyone here in this room,
[3415.32 → 3416.86] are foreigners on this earth.
[3418.58 → 3419.90] So God's people,
[3420.10 → 3421.16] right now the church,
[3422.00 → 3422.40] us,
[3422.56 → 3423.42] we are citizens
[3423.42 → 3425.96] of the kingdom of heaven.
[3425.96 → 3428.72] New Testament
[3428.72 → 3429.80] gives us lots of examples.
[3429.96 → 3430.76] Philippians 3,
[3430.90 → 3432.22] 20 to 21 says,
[3432.22 → 3433.56] but our citizenship
[3433.56 → 3434.74] is in heaven
[3434.74 → 3436.72] and we eagerly await
[3436.72 → 3437.84] a saviour from there,
[3438.08 → 3438.80] the Lord Jesus,
[3438.98 → 3439.64] who by the power
[3439.64 → 3440.40] that enables him
[3440.40 → 3441.36] to bring everything
[3441.36 → 3442.24] under his control
[3442.24 → 3443.36] will transform
[3443.36 → 3444.28] our lowly bodies
[3444.28 → 3445.54] so that they will be
[3445.54 → 3446.90] like his glorious body.
[3447.70 → 3448.88] As citizens in heaven,
[3449.00 → 3449.88] we are foreigners here.
[3450.20 → 3451.62] 1 Peter 2, 11 to 12 says,
[3451.62 → 3452.22] Dear friends,
[3452.46 → 3453.22] I urge you,
[3453.60 → 3455.68] as foreigners and exiles,
[3456.44 → 3457.98] to abstain from sinful desires
[3457.98 → 3458.92] which wage war
[3458.92 → 3459.86] against your soul.
[3460.22 → 3461.54] Live such good lives
[3461.54 → 3462.36] among the pagans
[3462.36 → 3463.78] that they may see
[3463.78 → 3464.68] your good deeds
[3464.68 → 3466.46] and glorify God
[3466.46 → 3468.00] on the day he visits.
[3468.30 → 3469.26] And then Hebrews 11,
[3469.42 → 3470.36] 13 to 16,
[3470.70 → 3471.66] links people,
[3471.80 → 3472.40] God's people,
[3472.46 → 3473.68] across all history
[3473.68 → 3474.58] and it says,
[3474.86 → 3475.92] All these people
[3475.92 → 3477.26] were still living by faith
[3477.26 → 3477.84] when they died.
[3478.12 → 3479.10] They did not receive
[3479.10 → 3480.12] the things they promised,
[3480.12 → 3481.64] admitting that they were
[3481.64 → 3483.48] foreigners and strangers
[3483.48 → 3484.58] on earth.
[3484.98 → 3485.76] They were longing
[3485.76 → 3486.80] for a better country,
[3487.10 → 3487.90] a heavenly one.
[3488.30 → 3488.62] Therefore,
[3489.20 → 3491.36] God is not ashamed
[3491.36 → 3492.52] to be called their God
[3492.52 → 3494.42] for he has prepared
[3494.42 → 3495.60] a city for them.
[3497.72 → 3500.04] Exile is the template
[3500.04 → 3501.14] for the church.
[3502.50 → 3504.10] That's our parallel here.
[3505.06 → 3506.60] We are in exile.
[3506.80 → 3508.80] We are ambassadors of Christ
[3508.80 → 3510.92] as 2 Corinthians 5 says.
[3511.16 → 3512.60] We are living here on earth
[3512.60 → 3515.24] as citizens of a different kingdom.
[3515.76 → 3516.66] God's kingdom.
[3517.94 → 3519.62] So we live in exile,
[3520.52 → 3522.28] fully present where we are,
[3523.32 → 3524.96] yet always knowing
[3524.96 → 3526.24] where our citizenship lies.
[3527.22 → 3528.60] We're to plant gardens,
[3529.10 → 3530.62] to fill the world,
[3530.72 → 3531.36] to subdue it,
[3531.40 → 3532.14] and to contribute
[3532.14 → 3533.50] to this culture.
[3533.62 → 3535.26] We're called to help shape
[3535.26 → 3536.42] this world
[3536.42 → 3538.24] that we are foreigners in,
[3538.78 → 3540.16] to give thanks to God
[3540.16 → 3541.92] wherever we are
[3541.92 → 3544.98] as foreigners and exiles
[3544.98 → 3546.92] in this city.
[3549.12 → 3550.40] And that kind of tracks
[3550.40 → 3551.12] a little bit, right?
[3552.06 → 3552.96] Because our world
[3552.96 → 3554.32] does kind of seem foreign
[3554.32 → 3555.66] to us every once in a while,
[3555.74 → 3556.22] doesn't it?
[3557.70 → 3559.02] Because I think as Christians,
[3559.42 → 3562.26] and you can call me on this later
[3562.26 → 3563.28] if you think I'm wrong,
[3563.28 → 3564.48] but I think as Christians,
[3564.60 → 3565.36] we can look around
[3565.36 → 3566.62] the world that we're in
[3566.62 → 3567.72] and we can think things like this.
[3567.96 → 3569.76] This world is far too left for me.
[3570.02 → 3571.80] Or culture has gone far too right
[3571.80 → 3572.46] in my opinion.
[3572.80 → 3573.92] Or maybe we feel things
[3573.92 → 3575.52] are too liberal nowadays
[3575.52 → 3576.48] or too conservative
[3576.48 → 3577.70] or too hostile
[3577.70 → 3578.94] or maybe too docile.
[3579.56 → 3580.54] Maybe too distant
[3580.54 → 3581.30] or too busy
[3581.30 → 3582.78] or too distracting
[3582.78 → 3584.56] or maybe too lonely.
[3587.32 → 3589.46] We can add a bunch of words
[3589.46 → 3590.54] that we would describe
[3590.54 → 3591.46] our culture with there.
[3593.28 → 3594.30] Maybe some of that
[3594.30 → 3595.12] or any of that
[3595.12 → 3596.04] is true with you
[3596.04 → 3596.64] where you sit.
[3596.70 → 3597.62] But here's the thing.
[3598.46 → 3599.30] Whatever culture
[3599.30 → 3600.42] is too much of,
[3601.08 → 3602.06] in your opinion,
[3602.86 → 3604.38] it's actually not
[3604.38 → 3605.24] the real problem.
[3607.04 → 3607.74] See, the problem
[3607.74 → 3608.82] isn't that our culture
[3608.82 → 3610.42] fails to match
[3610.42 → 3611.72] what Scripture describes.
[3613.00 → 3615.38] It's that we make God small
[3615.38 → 3617.28] and forget that He knew
[3617.28 → 3618.86] exactly what our world
[3618.86 → 3619.40] would become.
[3619.40 → 3623.70] God is big, right?
[3624.76 → 3625.60] He's not just bigger
[3625.60 → 3628.18] than the political tensions
[3628.18 → 3628.90] of this world
[3628.90 → 3630.34] or the cultural chaos
[3630.34 → 3631.46] that we find ourselves in
[3631.46 → 3632.48] or the cracks
[3632.48 → 3633.40] in the world systems
[3633.40 → 3634.56] that we see.
[3637.56 → 3638.54] He's reigning
[3638.54 → 3639.28] and ruling
[3639.28 → 3640.24] over all of it.
[3641.70 → 3642.86] As foreigners here,
[3642.94 → 3643.98] we're not here
[3643.98 → 3645.24] to make our faith
[3645.24 → 3646.74] fit our politics
[3646.74 → 3647.88] or our preferences
[3647.88 → 3649.32] or our echo chambers,
[3649.52 → 3650.40] but we are here
[3650.40 → 3651.20] to let Jesus
[3651.20 → 3652.28] shape the way
[3652.28 → 3653.08] that we live
[3653.08 → 3654.18] in all of that.
[3654.70 → 3656.04] Live within the world
[3656.04 → 3658.10] for His kingdom purposes.
[3659.66 → 3661.04] See, the kingdom of God,
[3661.30 → 3661.96] even though it's not
[3661.96 → 3662.90] fully here yet,
[3663.00 → 3664.06] God is still to come.
[3664.68 → 3666.14] Jesus is still to return again
[3666.14 → 3666.96] at the end of time.
[3667.74 → 3669.06] But the kingdom of God,
[3669.18 → 3669.90] even though it's not
[3669.90 → 3670.68] fully here yet,
[3670.72 → 3671.76] is already political.
[3672.56 → 3672.96] Meaning,
[3673.12 → 3674.20] it already has a king.
[3675.08 → 3676.36] It already has a way
[3676.36 → 3678.68] and it already has a road map.
[3679.60 → 3680.88] So if we start thinking
[3680.88 → 3681.80] that the kingdom of God
[3681.80 → 3682.64] is more liberal
[3682.64 → 3683.84] or more conservative
[3683.84 → 3685.36] or more right-leaning
[3685.36 → 3686.26] or more left-leaning,
[3686.42 → 3687.50] if we try to squeeze
[3687.50 → 3688.68] our own personal
[3688.68 → 3690.02] or national ideologies
[3690.02 → 3691.00] into God's kingdom,
[3691.40 → 3692.14] then we don't have
[3692.14 → 3693.22] a big God anymore.
[3693.56 → 3695.10] We have a very malleable one.
[3697.16 → 3698.38] We have a God,
[3698.68 → 3699.34] small g,
[3699.34 → 3700.38] who bends
[3700.38 → 3701.84] to fit our opinions
[3701.84 → 3703.84] instead of a God
[3703.84 → 3705.10] who reigns over all things.
[3706.02 → 3707.98] Even the very culture
[3707.98 → 3710.18] that we're in right now.
[3712.06 → 3713.44] Because our God,
[3713.54 → 3714.46] our big God,
[3714.56 → 3716.26] reigns over everything.
[3717.18 → 3718.14] Our politics,
[3718.52 → 3719.66] our worldviews,
[3720.32 → 3720.90] our culture.
[3721.48 → 3722.80] He's not threatened by them.
[3723.62 → 3725.24] He's not surprised by them.
[3725.92 → 3727.24] And He's not working
[3727.24 → 3728.36] despite them.
[3729.06 → 3731.42] He rules over them.
[3734.50 → 3735.88] In the Heidelberg Catechism,
[3735.96 → 3736.88] which is a confession
[3736.88 → 3737.50] that this church
[3737.50 → 3738.94] and Christian Reformed churches
[3738.94 → 3740.30] confess are true,
[3740.56 → 3741.68] it asks this question
[3741.68 → 3742.56] in Lord's Day 10.
[3743.04 → 3743.56] It asks,
[3743.98 → 3744.76] why is it good
[3744.76 → 3745.64] for us to know
[3745.64 → 3746.46] that God has created
[3746.46 → 3747.10] all things
[3747.10 → 3748.42] and still upholds them
[3748.42 → 3749.22] by His providence?
[3750.28 → 3751.22] And the answer is beautiful.
[3752.02 → 3752.88] The answer to question
[3752.88 → 3754.78] in answer 28,
[3754.88 → 3755.40] Lord's Day 10,
[3755.46 → 3755.86] says this.
[3755.86 → 3757.90] We can be patient
[3757.90 → 3758.64] in adversity,
[3759.56 → 3761.02] thankful in prosperity,
[3761.52 → 3762.36] and with a view
[3762.36 → 3763.02] to the future,
[3763.14 → 3764.58] we can have a firm confidence
[3764.58 → 3765.78] in our faithful God
[3765.78 → 3766.26] and Father
[3766.26 → 3767.48] that no creature
[3767.48 → 3768.50] shall separate us
[3768.50 → 3770.32] from His love.
[3771.32 → 3772.30] For all creatures
[3772.30 → 3773.78] are so completely
[3773.78 → 3775.20] in His hand
[3775.20 → 3776.82] that without His will,
[3777.26 → 3777.80] they cannot
[3777.80 → 3780.02] so much as move.
[3780.02 → 3782.78] we can be patient
[3782.78 → 3784.38] and confident
[3784.38 → 3785.84] and thankful
[3785.84 → 3787.28] wherever we are
[3787.28 → 3788.74] because our God,
[3788.90 → 3790.14] this big God,
[3790.20 → 3791.26] is the one ordaining
[3791.26 → 3792.04] both the good
[3792.04 → 3793.18] and the bad,
[3793.28 → 3794.36] the good things we enjoy
[3794.36 → 3795.68] and the hardships we endure.
[3795.96 → 3797.76] He is present in both.
[3797.98 → 3799.56] He is more than present in both.
[3799.76 → 3801.18] He is ruling over both.
[3801.18 → 3802.94] He is Lord over both.
[3803.76 → 3804.50] So again,
[3804.58 → 3805.80] the question is asked,
[3805.90 → 3806.72] do you believe
[3806.72 → 3807.60] in a God
[3807.60 → 3808.70] who is big enough
[3808.70 → 3809.30] to do that?
[3810.70 → 3811.80] A God who is big enough
[3811.80 → 3812.74] to hold your blessings
[3812.74 → 3813.46] and your burdens,
[3813.74 → 3814.36] your comforts
[3814.36 → 3815.16] and your chaos
[3815.16 → 3816.28] and be in control
[3816.28 → 3817.00] the whole time
[3817.00 → 3818.36] because that's the God
[3818.36 → 3819.24] that Jeremiah
[3819.24 → 3820.78] is pointing his people to.
[3825.62 → 3826.96] And so to help us
[3826.96 → 3828.74] see the answer
[3828.74 → 3830.00] as yes to that question,
[3830.40 → 3831.42] we must look ahead.
[3831.52 → 3832.10] That's what Jeremiah
[3832.10 → 3833.14] does in his book too.
[3833.94 → 3834.82] Our text today,
[3834.90 → 3836.10] those seven verses we read,
[3836.22 → 3837.50] is just a little sniff
[3837.50 → 3839.56] of Jeremiah's overarching point.
[3840.06 → 3841.38] Later in this letter actually,
[3841.44 → 3842.90] we get one of the most popular
[3842.90 → 3844.06] verses in all Scripture,
[3844.48 → 3845.34] not just this book,
[3845.54 → 3847.08] where God says this to his people.
[3847.72 → 3848.66] You guys can probably
[3848.66 → 3849.50] recite it with me,
[3849.52 → 3850.44] at least many of you could.
[3850.50 → 3852.06] For I know the plans
[3852.06 → 3852.82] I have for you,
[3852.92 → 3853.68] declares the Lord.
[3854.02 → 3855.32] Plans to prosper you
[3855.32 → 3856.22] and not to harm you.
[3856.52 → 3857.58] Plans to give you hope
[3857.58 → 3858.50] and a future.
[3859.06 → 3860.02] We love this verse
[3860.02 → 3860.60] as Christians.
[3861.22 → 3861.92] Jeremiah 29.
[3862.04 → 3863.36] We love applying this verse
[3863.36 → 3863.94] to our lives,
[3863.98 → 3864.34] don't we?
[3864.34 → 3865.78] We do.
[3865.86 → 3866.52] We think it has to do
[3866.52 → 3867.90] with our future job opportunities
[3867.90 → 3869.02] or potential scholarships
[3869.02 → 3869.72] we might get
[3869.72 → 3871.68] or our future relationships maybe
[3871.68 → 3873.18] or if we're lucky,
[3873.26 → 3874.94] the next drink we're going to get
[3874.94 → 3876.34] at the Starbucks down the road
[3876.34 → 3877.82] because it's pumpkin spice season
[3877.82 → 3878.38] and we're like,
[3878.44 → 3879.38] oh, maybe that's in the works
[3879.38 → 3879.96] for us today.
[3880.22 → 3881.36] It's street culture time.
[3882.24 → 3883.38] Those things taste like feet.
[3883.44 → 3884.30] I think they're so gross.
[3886.44 → 3887.56] But we do that, right?
[3887.70 → 3888.34] We do that.
[3889.02 → 3890.12] We apply this verse
[3890.12 → 3891.02] to our future.
[3893.14 → 3894.60] And while we're hearing today
[3894.60 → 3895.06] that yes,
[3895.16 → 3896.36] God reigns over everything,
[3897.84 → 3898.92] this text,
[3900.00 → 3901.14] Jeremiah 29.11,
[3902.10 → 3903.30] is not about your job
[3903.30 → 3904.66] or your scholarships
[3904.66 → 3905.90] or your relationships
[3905.90 → 3908.62] or your future cold brews.
[3909.12 → 3910.02] It is about
[3910.02 → 3912.12] this specific group
[3912.12 → 3913.34] of people
[3913.34 → 3915.22] returning home from exile
[3915.22 → 3916.14] in Babylon
[3916.14 → 3918.04] and awaiting the arrival
[3918.04 → 3918.72] of a Messiah,
[3919.28 → 3920.42] giving them hope
[3920.42 → 3921.50] for their future,
[3921.72 → 3922.50] looking ahead
[3922.50 → 3925.08] down their story.
[3926.20 → 3927.32] Israel was to recognize
[3927.32 → 3928.46] that while they would be
[3928.46 → 3929.80] in Babylon for a while,
[3930.06 → 3931.34] while they were to settle in,
[3931.60 → 3932.64] their future was secure.
[3934.00 → 3935.54] They would one day return home.
[3935.66 → 3936.28] They would one day
[3936.28 → 3937.24] build that temple again
[3937.24 → 3938.32] and they would one day
[3938.32 → 3939.20] meet the Messiah.
[3941.24 → 3942.62] And then that future happened.
[3943.72 → 3944.48] We read in Ezra
[3944.48 → 3945.48] that they did return home.
[3946.46 → 3947.04] We read in Ezra
[3947.04 → 3947.92] that they did rebuild.
[3948.04 → 3948.40] The temple.
[3949.38 → 3950.64] And then 400 years later,
[3950.72 → 3951.80] their Messiah was born
[3951.80 → 3953.50] in a manger in Bethlehem.
[3953.58 → 3954.76] Our Messiah.
[3956.14 → 3957.72] See, Jesus came down
[3957.72 → 3958.68] from his throne in heaven.
[3958.80 → 3960.00] He made himself nothing
[3960.00 → 3961.76] and became man,
[3961.98 → 3963.20] fully God and fully man,
[3963.28 → 3963.94] born in a manger.
[3964.20 → 3965.92] And he lived a perfect life
[3965.92 → 3967.18] that you and I fail to live
[3967.18 → 3968.40] each and every day.
[3970.46 → 3971.54] And then he died
[3971.54 → 3974.50] an excruciating death
[3974.50 → 3976.48] that we all deserved.
[3977.92 → 3979.70] Bearing the weight of human sin
[3979.70 → 3980.64] throughout history
[3980.64 → 3981.32] on his shoulders.
[3981.78 → 3983.36] Suffering more than we will ever know.
[3985.36 → 3988.06] Suffering more than we will ever know.
[3989.72 → 3991.12] Hanging from a piece of wood.
[3994.12 → 3994.92] He died.
[3994.92 → 3998.06] And then three days later,
[3998.06 → 3999.40] he rose again from the dead.
[4002.20 → 4003.68] Jesus rose from the dead.
[4005.28 → 4006.32] He ascended to heaven.
[4006.32 → 4007.68] And now he rules
[4007.68 → 4009.14] the right hand of God,
[4009.56 → 4011.06] intermediating on our behalf
[4011.06 → 4012.76] until he comes again
[4012.76 → 4013.38] in the future
[4013.38 → 4014.50] to usher in his kingdom,
[4014.62 → 4015.50] the new heaven and the new earth
[4015.50 → 4016.20] once and for all.
[4017.48 → 4019.58] That will happen.
[4020.32 → 4021.60] And we, the church,
[4021.72 → 4023.18] can look ahead to that
[4023.18 → 4025.72] knowing that our future
[4025.72 → 4028.00] is secure in Jesus' hands.
[4028.98 → 4030.22] We live on this side
[4030.22 → 4030.74] of the cross,
[4030.84 → 4032.14] on this side of the empty tomb,
[4032.34 → 4033.62] on this side of the ascension.
[4033.92 → 4035.00] Our hope is assured.
[4035.52 → 4036.44] And because of that,
[4036.88 → 4038.72] we can find joy
[4038.72 → 4040.64] in our suffering.
[4041.40 → 4042.66] Not because it's easy,
[4042.90 → 4044.28] not because pain feels good,
[4044.42 → 4046.02] but because the word of God,
[4046.02 → 4048.64] the authority that our life sits on,
[4049.00 → 4049.70] tells us so,
[4049.82 → 4051.30] reveals that truth to us.
[4052.00 → 4054.08] Jesus himself said in Matthew 5,
[4054.46 → 4055.24] blessed are you
[4055.24 → 4056.52] when others persecute you.
[4057.38 → 4058.52] James reminds us
[4058.52 → 4060.00] in James 1, 2-4
[4060.00 → 4061.66] to consider it pure joy
[4061.66 → 4063.00] when we face trials.
[4064.12 → 4064.80] Paul says that
[4064.80 → 4066.22] when we suffer with Christ,
[4066.42 → 4068.30] we'll also be glorified with him
[4068.30 → 4068.98] in Romans 8.
[4069.30 → 4070.20] And Peter tells us
[4070.20 → 4071.42] not to be surprised
[4071.42 → 4072.44] by the fiery trials
[4072.44 → 4073.10] that come our way.
[4073.10 → 4074.20] They're evidence
[4074.20 → 4077.06] that we belong to Christ.
[4077.76 → 4079.30] That we belong to him.
[4081.06 → 4082.24] See, the joy of suffering
[4082.24 → 4083.04] is not the pain
[4083.04 → 4083.86] that we are going through.
[4083.94 → 4085.14] It's in what it points to.
[4085.56 → 4086.50] Suffering is a marker
[4086.50 → 4089.68] of union with our Lord
[4089.68 → 4090.96] and Saviour Jesus Christ.
[4091.06 → 4091.44] And church,
[4091.66 → 4092.84] there is nothing better
[4092.84 → 4093.54] in this world
[4093.54 → 4096.08] than being united with Christ.
[4097.32 → 4098.38] Even in hardship,
[4099.86 → 4100.90] even when we suffer,
[4102.10 → 4102.84] or we mourn,
[4102.88 → 4103.52] or we struggle,
[4103.68 → 4105.58] we are united with him,
[4105.92 → 4107.80] our suffering Saviour.
[4110.24 → 4111.08] So yes,
[4111.74 → 4113.40] on this Thanksgiving Sunday,
[4113.40 → 4114.82] let's thank God.
[4114.82 → 4116.34] Let's thank our big God.
[4116.68 → 4117.60] Not just for the good
[4117.60 → 4118.32] and lovely gifts,
[4118.40 → 4119.32] though we can thank him
[4119.32 → 4120.06] and should thank him
[4120.06 → 4120.70] for those too,
[4122.26 → 4123.20] but for the joys
[4123.20 → 4124.24] that he brings us
[4124.24 → 4125.38] even through the suffering
[4125.38 → 4126.74] that he's ordained for us.
[4126.86 → 4128.32] Because in that suffering,
[4128.64 → 4130.82] we find his presence.
[4131.96 → 4133.68] We find his power.
[4134.56 → 4136.16] We find his promises.
[4137.68 → 4138.24] Paul tells us
[4138.24 → 4139.40] in 1 Thessalonians 5,
[4139.40 → 4140.64] 16 to 18,
[4140.64 → 4141.78] that we are to rejoice
[4141.78 → 4142.92] always.
[4143.86 → 4144.82] We're to pray
[4144.82 → 4145.68] without ceasing.
[4146.62 → 4148.14] And we are to give thanks
[4148.14 → 4149.94] in all circumstances,
[4150.16 → 4151.00] not just the good ones,
[4151.86 → 4153.08] for this is God's will
[4153.08 → 4155.02] for us in Christ Jesus.
[4155.28 → 4156.10] So that's what we do.
[4156.78 → 4158.34] We always rejoice,
[4158.46 → 4159.56] no matter our situation.
[4160.08 → 4161.52] We pray in the good
[4161.52 → 4162.26] and the bad.
[4162.34 → 4163.00] We give thanks
[4163.00 → 4164.26] in all circumstances,
[4164.68 → 4165.70] even in our exile,
[4166.02 → 4166.90] even in our suffering.
[4166.90 → 4169.82] And we settle in
[4169.82 → 4170.84] to this world,
[4170.98 → 4172.08] this foreign world
[4172.08 → 4173.30] that we find ourselves in.
[4173.32 → 4174.56] And we roll up our sleeves.
[4174.86 → 4175.92] We get our hands dirty.
[4176.04 → 4177.10] We plant gardens.
[4177.24 → 4177.94] We raise families.
[4178.08 → 4178.92] We bless our communities.
[4179.16 → 4179.84] We contribute
[4179.84 → 4180.90] to the culture
[4180.90 → 4182.48] that we find ourselves in.
[4182.60 → 4183.82] And we live with purpose
[4183.82 → 4184.54] right here
[4184.54 → 4186.30] where God has placed us.
[4186.44 → 4187.38] And through it all,
[4188.14 → 4189.52] we follow God
[4189.52 → 4191.22] and remember who he is.
[4192.32 → 4193.32] He's bigger than you
[4193.32 → 4194.50] could ever imagine him to be.
[4194.50 → 4197.34] And he's ruling over everything,
[4197.48 → 4198.10] even the things
[4198.10 → 4198.82] you don't understand.
[4200.20 → 4201.06] And he's at work
[4201.06 → 4202.46] in places you've never expected,
[4202.66 → 4203.34] even here,
[4203.84 → 4204.48] even now.
[4205.22 → 4206.40] So let's give thanks to him
[4206.40 → 4207.56] no matter where we are.
[4207.66 → 4207.88] Amen?
[4208.84 → 4209.78] Let's pray together.
[4209.88 → 4210.60] In a moment, actually,
[4210.64 → 4211.38] we're going to take part
[4211.38 → 4212.78] in the Lord's Supper together,
[4212.88 → 4213.74] which is a meal
[4213.74 → 4215.50] that reminds us
[4215.50 → 4216.26] of his magnitude
[4216.26 → 4217.92] and his grace for us all.
[4217.94 → 4219.60] A meal that he is present with
[4219.60 → 4220.98] every time we take it.
[4221.46 → 4222.26] Present with us
[4222.26 → 4223.14] around this table.
[4223.14 → 4224.34] Pastor Chris is going to
[4224.34 → 4225.08] lead us through that.
[4225.34 → 4226.12] But before we do that,
[4226.30 → 4227.40] please bow your heads with me.
[4229.74 → 4230.58] Father in heaven,
[4231.52 → 4233.04] you are a big God.
[4233.28 → 4234.22] Not merely bigger
[4234.22 → 4234.94] than the situations
[4234.94 → 4236.04] we find ourselves in,
[4236.10 → 4237.04] but a big God
[4237.04 → 4239.18] ruling over everything.
[4240.76 → 4241.86] God, may you
[4241.86 → 4244.10] somehow shape our minds
[4244.10 → 4244.62] and our hearts
[4244.62 → 4246.40] to understand your magnitude.
[4247.88 → 4249.16] And in that, Lord,
[4249.64 → 4250.90] on this Thanksgiving Day,
[4250.90 → 4251.70] God, we thank you
[4251.70 → 4253.12] for everything you have given us.
[4253.72 → 4255.50] We thank you for people,
[4255.64 → 4256.26] for community,
[4256.52 → 4258.98] for the joys of living
[4258.98 → 4260.18] here in Canada,
[4260.72 → 4262.40] for all the blessings
[4262.40 → 4262.94] that we have
[4262.94 → 4263.68] each and every day.
[4264.64 → 4266.60] And we thank you
[4266.60 → 4267.28] for our suffering.
[4268.54 → 4269.42] And God, you rule
[4269.42 → 4270.24] over all of that.
[4270.78 → 4271.68] You know what everybody
[4271.68 → 4272.38] is going through.
[4272.46 → 4273.52] You know what is on our hearts.
[4273.98 → 4275.40] May we be drawn closer to you
[4275.40 → 4277.40] and be united to you
[4277.40 → 4278.92] through those times as well.
[4279.88 → 4281.10] And so this Thanksgiving Sunday,
[4281.22 → 4281.88] may we be thankful
[4281.88 → 4282.66] for all of it.
[4283.42 → 4284.52] May we be thankful for you,
[4284.62 → 4285.20] for your son,
[4285.30 → 4286.06] for his life, death,
[4286.10 → 4286.54] and resurrection,
[4286.84 → 4287.68] for the grace and mercy
[4287.68 → 4288.40] that are found
[4288.40 → 4290.62] in the gospel truth of Jesus.
[4291.64 → 4292.40] And we thank you
[4292.40 → 4293.00] for this future
[4293.00 → 4294.60] that is secure and assured,
[4295.64 → 4296.62] the hope that we can
[4296.62 → 4297.46] only find in him.
[4298.44 → 4299.84] May all of that rest
[4299.84 → 4300.86] in our hearts today.
[4301.58 → 4302.50] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[4302.72 → 4303.70] We pray this in your name.
[4304.06 → 4304.28] Amen.
[4304.28 → 4304.38] Amen.
[4308.92 → 4314.06] God's word is sure.
[4315.38 → 4318.12] And the God his word reveals
[4318.12 → 4319.70] is true.
[4321.88 → 4324.48] And so even as we have met God
[4324.48 → 4325.40] in his word,
[4326.14 → 4327.30] he now invites us
[4327.30 → 4329.32] to meet him at his table.
[4330.46 → 4331.92] The grace that was offered
[4331.92 → 4332.88] in God's word
[4332.88 → 4334.46] is the grace that is present
[4334.46 → 4335.94] in this table.
[4335.94 → 4339.70] God knew that as foreigners
[4339.70 → 4341.32] and exiles,
[4341.68 → 4343.52] we would need something
[4343.52 → 4345.00] to sustain us
[4345.00 → 4346.18] in this journey of faith.
[4347.20 → 4348.42] And so he gave us
[4348.42 → 4349.70] this banquet,
[4350.26 → 4352.14] not only as a reminder
[4352.14 → 4353.72] of his ultimate victory,
[4354.08 → 4356.44] but as a sure sign
[4356.44 → 4358.46] of his presence with us.
[4359.40 → 4361.78] This is the feast table
[4361.78 → 4363.02] of the king.
[4363.02 → 4365.42] And so we come to him
[4365.42 → 4367.10] as his people,
[4367.30 → 4368.24] as strangers
[4368.24 → 4369.70] and exiles,
[4369.86 → 4370.84] we come to him
[4370.84 → 4372.20] to be nourished
[4372.20 → 4373.42] by his word
[4373.42 → 4374.78] and by his spirit
[4374.78 → 4376.30] that together
[4376.30 → 4377.16] we might taste
[4377.16 → 4377.74] and see
[4377.74 → 4378.92] that the Lord is good.
[4379.66 → 4380.54] So I invite you
[4380.54 → 4382.78] to come to the table
[4382.78 → 4384.18] of our Lord
[4384.18 → 4385.30] to speak the liturgy
[4385.30 → 4386.54] that we walk through
[4386.54 → 4387.16] and to,
[4387.58 → 4388.50] at this moment,
[4388.92 → 4390.94] meet your God.
[4390.94 → 4392.72] congregation
[4392.72 → 4394.28] of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[4394.78 → 4397.04] lift your hearts.
[4399.88 → 4401.22] Let us give thanks
[4401.22 → 4402.58] to the Lord our God.
[4403.26 → 4404.64] It is time for us
[4404.64 → 4405.54] to give thanks.
[4406.00 → 4406.84] Let's pray together.
[4406.84 → 4409.54] With joy,
[4409.78 → 4411.12] we praise you,
[4411.48 → 4412.58] gracious God.
[4413.52 → 4414.58] For you have created
[4414.58 → 4415.66] heaven and earth.
[4415.76 → 4416.42] You have made us
[4416.42 → 4417.06] in your image.
[4417.42 → 4418.42] You have kept covenant
[4418.42 → 4419.04] with us
[4419.04 → 4420.44] even when we fell
[4420.44 → 4421.04] into sin.
[4421.90 → 4423.18] We give you thanks
[4423.18 → 4424.26] for Jesus Christ
[4424.26 → 4425.28] who by his life,
[4425.70 → 4425.92] death,
[4426.10 → 4426.72] and resurrection
[4426.72 → 4428.14] opened to us
[4428.14 → 4428.84] the way
[4428.84 → 4431.32] of everlasting life.
[4432.46 → 4433.78] Meet us here,
[4434.26 → 4434.72] we pray,
[4434.72 → 4435.82] in Jesus' name.
[4436.60 → 4436.88] Amen.
[4440.70 → 4441.92] Now our Lord Jesus,
[4442.30 → 4443.76] before he suffered,
[4444.10 → 4444.96] gave us
[4444.96 → 4446.26] this memorial
[4446.26 → 4447.68] of his sacrifice
[4447.68 → 4449.12] until he comes again.
[4450.22 → 4450.96] And the Lord Jesus,
[4451.22 → 4451.82] on the night
[4451.82 → 4453.54] that he was betrayed,
[4453.80 → 4454.36] took bread.
[4454.70 → 4455.98] And when he had given thanks,
[4456.16 → 4457.22] he broke it
[4457.22 → 4457.82] and said,
[4458.16 → 4459.34] this is my body
[4459.34 → 4460.42] which is for you.
[4461.02 → 4461.78] Do this
[4461.78 → 4462.62] in remembrance
[4462.62 → 4463.46] of me.
[4464.72 → 4465.86] And in the same way,
[4466.38 → 4467.14] he took the cup
[4467.14 → 4468.34] after supper,
[4468.78 → 4469.04] saying,
[4469.16 → 4469.78] this cup
[4469.78 → 4471.06] is the new covenant
[4471.06 → 4472.42] in my blood.
[4473.14 → 4473.80] Do this
[4473.80 → 4475.24] whenever you drink it
[4475.24 → 4476.32] in remembrance
[4476.32 → 4477.52] of me.
[4478.08 → 4478.68] For whenever
[4478.68 → 4479.90] you eat this bread
[4479.90 → 4480.72] and drink
[4480.72 → 4481.60] this cup,
[4481.80 → 4482.70] you proclaim
[4482.70 → 4483.78] the Lord's death
[4483.78 → 4485.92] until he comes again.
[4486.70 → 4488.68] This is the mystery
[4488.68 → 4490.70] of our faith.
[4490.70 → 4492.84] your death,
[4493.02 → 4493.54] O Christ,
[4493.68 → 4494.36] we proclaim.
[4494.90 → 4496.10] Your resurrection
[4496.10 → 4497.02] we affirm
[4497.02 → 4497.74] with joy.
[4498.42 → 4499.16] You're coming
[4499.16 → 4499.92] we await
[4499.92 → 4500.54] with hope.
[4501.38 → 4502.70] Glory be to you,
[4502.86 → 4503.46] Lord Jesus.
[4505.36 → 4506.36] Church family,
[4506.76 → 4508.22] the Lord has prepared
[4508.22 → 4509.04] his table
[4509.04 → 4509.76] for all
[4509.76 → 4510.86] who love him
[4510.86 → 4512.00] and who trust in him
[4512.00 → 4512.56] alone
[4512.56 → 4513.82] for their salvation.
[4513.82 → 4515.80] And so,
[4516.04 → 4517.64] come to this table,
[4518.08 → 4519.00] you who have
[4519.00 → 4519.88] much faith
[4519.88 → 4521.14] and you
[4521.14 → 4522.34] who would have
[4522.34 → 4522.64] more.
[4524.28 → 4525.08] Come to
[4525.08 → 4526.70] this table,
[4527.02 → 4527.60] you who have
[4527.60 → 4528.32] been to this
[4528.32 → 4529.32] sacrament often
[4529.32 → 4530.36] and you who have
[4530.36 → 4531.28] not been for
[4531.28 → 4532.12] a long time.
[4533.02 → 4534.08] Come to this table,
[4534.26 → 4534.80] you who have
[4534.80 → 4535.82] tried to follow
[4535.82 → 4536.26] Jesus
[4536.26 → 4537.48] and
[4537.48 → 4539.52] we who have
[4539.52 → 4539.88] failed.
[4539.88 → 4542.58] come to this
[4542.58 → 4543.00] table
[4543.00 → 4544.70] because Jesus
[4544.70 → 4545.36] Christ
[4545.36 → 4546.48] is
[4546.48 → 4547.52] raised
[4547.52 → 4548.64] and he speaks
[4548.64 → 4549.32] to your heart
[4549.32 → 4550.40] now and says
[4550.40 → 4551.32] come.
[4552.54 → 4553.06] These are the
[4553.06 → 4553.80] gifts of God
[4553.80 → 4555.04] for the people
[4555.04 → 4556.00] of God.
[4557.50 → 4558.56] As we come
[4558.56 → 4559.24] to this table
[4559.24 → 4560.14] together,
[4560.58 → 4561.14] it is our
[4561.14 → 4561.96] practice here
[4561.96 → 4563.32] to come forward
[4563.32 → 4564.12] in groups
[4564.12 → 4564.76] and we will
[4564.76 → 4565.42] make a
[4565.42 → 4566.62] small circle
[4566.62 → 4567.58] around the
[4567.58 → 4567.96] table
[4567.96 → 4569.44] and we
[4569.44 → 4569.68] will
[4569.68 → 4570.58] pass the
[4570.58 → 4571.12] elements
[4571.12 → 4571.68] serving
[4571.68 → 4572.38] each other.
[4572.98 → 4573.24] And so,
[4573.34 → 4573.68] when you
[4573.68 → 4574.44] pass the
[4574.44 → 4574.80] bread
[4574.80 → 4575.22] to the
[4575.22 → 4575.48] person
[4575.48 → 4575.82] beside
[4575.82 → 4576.16] you,
[4576.28 → 4576.40] we
[4576.40 → 4576.78] invite
[4576.78 → 4576.94] you
[4576.94 → 4577.14] to
[4577.14 → 4577.46] say
[4577.46 → 4577.94] the
[4577.94 → 4578.24] body
[4578.24 → 4578.44] of
[4578.44 → 4578.78] Christ
[4578.78 → 4579.10] given
[4579.10 → 4579.32] for
[4579.32 → 4579.50] you.
[4579.90 → 4580.22] When you
[4580.22 → 4580.70] pass the
[4580.70 → 4581.02] juice
[4581.02 → 4581.70] to the
[4581.70 → 4581.98] person
[4581.98 → 4582.42] beside
[4582.42 → 4582.62] you,
[4582.72 → 4582.82] we
[4582.82 → 4583.10] invite
[4583.10 → 4583.28] you
[4583.28 → 4583.46] to
[4583.46 → 4583.70] say
[4583.70 → 4583.94] the

[5880.16 → 5909.16] Above all power, above all key, above all nature and all created things.
[5910.16 → 5923.16] Above all wisdom and all the ways of men, you were here before the world began.
[5924.16 → 5937.16] Above all kingdoms, above all the pros, above all wonders the world would never know.
[5937.16 → 5951.16] Above all wisdom and the treasures of the earth, there's no place that you want your world.
[5951.16 → 5967.16] You crucified, lay behind the stone, you lived to die, rejected and alone by the rose.
[5967.16 → 5974.16] Trampled on the ground, it's worth the fall.
[5974.16 → 5992.16] Above all wisdom and the world, above all wisdom and all created things.
[5992.16 → 6001.16] Above all kings, above all nature and all created things.
[6001.16 → 6014.16] Above all wisdom and all the ways of men, you were here before the world began.

[6042.16 → 6044.16] Above all worlds, above all worlds, above all.
[6044.16 → 6058.16] You crucified, lay behind the stone, you lived to die, rejected and alone by the rose.
[6058.16 → 6060.16] You travelled on the ground, you took the fall.
[6060.16 → 6065.16] You travelled on the ground, you took the fall.
[6065.16 → 6066.16] You travelled on the ground, you took the fall.
[6066.16 → 6073.16] You thought of me, you fell on the ground.
[6073.16 → 6087.16] You crucified, lay behind the stone, you lived to die, rejected and alone by the rose.
[6087.16 → 6089.16] Trampled on the ground, you took the fall.
[6089.16 → 6094.16] You took the fall, you took the fall.
[6094.16 → 6097.16] You took the fall, you took the fall.
[6097.16 → 6106.16] I am weak, above all.
[6110.16 → 6115.16] And so as we go from this place on this Thanksgiving Sunday, let's remember two things.
[6115.16 → 6119.16] We are not going into a world where we are a part of the world.
[6119.16 → 6120.16] We are foreigners in this world.
[6120.16 → 6128.16] So let us dig in, settle in, roll up our sleeves and remember where we are citizens from.
[6128.16 → 6137.16] And may we give thanks this Thanksgiving Day, not just for the blessings that we get, but if we can, vocalize the suffering that we're in.
[6137.16 → 6144.16] In our hearts, let's surrender that to Jesus too, knowing that we are united with him in even the suffering that we experience today.
[6144.16 → 6147.16] Please go from this place with this blessing.
[6147.16 → 6150.16] From number six, the priestly blessing.
[6150.16 → 6153.16] The Lord bless you and keep you.
[6153.16 → 6157.16] The Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[6157.16 → 6163.16] The Lord turn his face toward you and give you his peace.
[6163.16 → 6166.16] And all of God's people said, Amen.
[6166.16 → 6167.16] Amen.
[6167.16 → 6168.16] Amen.
[6168.16 → 6169.16] Amen.
