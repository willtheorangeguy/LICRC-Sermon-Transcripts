[3128.02 → 3134.26] father it is very important that we remember to confess our many sins before you in the words of
[3134.26 → 3140.50] king David for day and night your hand was heavy on me my strength was sapped as in the heat of summer
[3141.06 → 3147.30] then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity I said I will confess my transgressions
[3147.30 → 3153.78] to the lord, and you forgave the guilt of my sin father we know that we need to confess that we are sinful
[3153.78 → 3160.82] people it is because of human sin and human rebellion that we need to be reconciled to you and that Jesus needed to come down
[3161.38 → 3162.98] thank you for that gift of love
[3164.42 → 3167.38] father we come to you because we have many reasons to be thankful

[3175.70 → 3179.22] graduation is a milestone life event that is worthy of celebrating
[3179.22 → 3188.66] we pray for all of them as they enter the next chapter of their lives whether it is work or more schooling we pray that all of them will be assured that they face the future with you
[3189.86 → 3192.74] we thank you for the changing seasons in the beginning of summer
[3193.06 → 3198.02] it is an opportunity for all of us to spend some time outdoors and to experience the beauty of your creation
[3198.66 → 3204.02] some of us will work some of us will travel and all of us will use the opportunity to be with friends and family

[3224.26 → 3230.10] bless these ministries and the work that they do may they meet the spiritual and physical needs that we see around us
[3230.10 → 3235.86] in particular we thank you for another group of graduates the grade fours who just finished children's
[3235.86 → 3242.66] worship time as they grow they'll be part of other ministries gems cadets youth young adults and then

[3261.54 → 3268.42] those they were interacting with father we think of the joys and the needs that we have as a Christian
[3268.42 → 3275.14] community we think about the needs of the world we pray again for conflicts in Ukraine and Russia
[3275.14 → 3281.30] in Israel and Gaza and now the tense situation we have in Iran, but those are just the conflicts that we see
[3281.30 → 3288.18] so often in the news it is easy not to notice conflicts in Sudan Myanmar Somalia Yemen and other
[3288.18 → 3294.90] places we pray for all leaders on both sides of every conflict that they may see the value of living
[3294.90 → 3300.98] next to each other as neighbours and use that as a basis for achieving a meaningful and lasting peace
[3302.10 → 3308.58] we also think about the needs of this congregation we pray again for peace and comfort for Tanya test

[3315.38 → 3322.58] family will experience your peace we continue to pray for Doug tendon as he is being treated for cancer

[3328.58 → 3334.90] chemotherapy and is feeling much better we think about clary's sister Joan as well who has finished
[3334.90 → 3339.86] radiation treatment for cancer we thank you that both of them seem to be in good health for now we
[3339.86 → 3347.30] pray that you continue to be with them as uh as they consider their treatment we pray for pastor
[3347.30 → 3352.50] Chris as he begins a study of your word as revealed in the gospel according to Matthew even though it is
[3352.50 → 3359.14] not advent or Christmastime we always celebrate the coming of Emmanuel god with us, we pray that the
[3359.14 → 3365.62] message of Jesus the fulfillment of promise is one that will reach each of us oh come let us sing unto
[3365.62 → 3380.58] the lord let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation amen
[3380.58 → 3397.46] as Dave beautifully prayed we are indeed going to start a summer series through the gospel according
[3397.46 → 3404.98] to Matthew each week we will read a particular text from the Gospel of Matthew, but we'll sort of
[3404.98 → 3413.14] live in the story of a chapter or two surrounding that text and so it will be very important if you're
[3413.14 → 3420.18] not an ordinary uh bible reader as we come to this time that you maybe bring your bible from home
[3421.30 → 3427.30] or have it on your device open it up because we'll read a section one time through, but then we'll look at
[3427.30 → 3434.10] other parts around there if you are looking for bibles there's some at the back we're also mindful that
[3434.10 → 3440.90] during the summer the youngest kids among us join us for worship, and so we want to include you in our
[3440.90 → 3447.70] conversation and in our time together there are some colouring clipboards and the like that are
[3447.70 → 3451.94] available, although it seems from my vantage point now that they've already all been dispersed and
[3451.94 → 3458.82] collected and so excellent job there whoever men that booth or takes care of that booth in the morning
[3458.82 → 3463.94] if you find that there aren't enough please let myself or maria know, and we'll make sure there's more
[3464.10 → 3473.14] for the following week we're going to begin this morning by reading in some sense what we normally read
[3473.14 → 3479.78] around Christmas starting at the beginning of the Gospel of Matthew and so with the parts of the story of
[3479.78 → 3491.70] the birth of Jesus and particularly the announcement to Joseph of Jesus impending birth so I'm going to begin in
[3491.70 → 3500.02] chapter 1 starting at verse 18 and I'll read through the end of verse 23 in this first time through together
[3502.42 → 3511.14] this is how the birth of Jesus the messiah came about his mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph
[3511.78 → 3516.58] but before they came together she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit
[3516.58 → 3524.74] because Joseph her husband was faithful to the law and yet did not want to expose her to public disgrace
[3524.74 → 3526.82] he had in mind to divorce her quietly
[3526.82 → 3535.62] but after he had considered this an angel of the lord appeared to him in a dream and said Joseph son of
[3535.62 → 3543.22] David do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife because what is conceived in her is from the holy
[3543.22 → 3551.94] spirit she will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus because he will save his people
[3551.94 → 3561.14] from their sins all this took place to fulfill what the lord had said through the prophet the virgin
[3561.14 → 3569.70] will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Emmanuel which means god with us this is the
[3569.70 → 3581.62] word of the lord I want to begin by telling you a story that you probably already know even if you've
[3581.62 → 3587.62] only heard it in cartoons or read about it in books I bet you know this kind of story
[3589.70 → 3597.38] kids have you ever read a story where the bad guy is on the throne, but the good king is somewhere out
[3597.38 → 3604.98] there, and we're all waiting for him to come back this is that kind of story once upon a time in a
[3604.98 → 3613.22] distant kingdom the true king was gone and in absence of the true king the people lived in fear
[3614.42 → 3623.70] an imposter sat on the throne cruel and power hungry and constantly paranoid under his rule the land felt
[3623.70 → 3634.74] like it was under a dark cloud, but rumours began to spread the rightful king was still alive and one day
[3634.74 → 3644.42] this king would return, and he would come quietly humbly but when he did come everything would change
[3645.22 → 3652.26] right the darkness would lift justice would roll like a river and the kingdom would rejoice
[3653.94 → 3660.42] now the story or a version of it sounds like the Lion King or Robin Hood or king Arthur or maybe the
[3660.42 → 3667.78] lion the witch in the wardrobe if you have the eyes to see it, but this story is deeper than a fairy tale
[3669.46 → 3679.30] these stories move us because they echo something true in us and we long for a good story we long for a
[3679.30 → 3686.82] good leader for a good king one who doesn't lie or manipulate one who doesn't use his people but lays down his
[3686.82 → 3693.86] life for them one who doesn't disappoint who doesn't grow corrupt who doesn't abandon us in our time of
[3693.86 → 3703.06] need to overlay the story of Jesus we live in a world full of heroes right leaders who cling to power with
[3703.06 → 3712.26] cleansed fits to who build their empires on fear and on blood and in a world like that you and I are left
[3712.26 → 3722.34] wondering is anyone really in charge here can anyone really be trusted at this moment will justice ever be
[3722.34 → 3729.86] done we live in a world and in a time and a place that feels increasingly out of control
[3732.10 → 3740.34] and maybe you felt that right the noise and the spin and the constant stream of bad news one moment
[3740.34 → 3748.90] it's wildfires and the next it's wars political leaders fail and fall short celebrities disappoint time
[3748.90 → 3755.54] and time again institutions that we once trusted collapse under the weight of scandal or compromise
[3757.06 → 3765.22] and we scroll we sigh we shake our heads because it all feels like too much
[3765.22 → 3774.90] and we wonder is anyone actually in control is anyone actually worthy of our celebration
[3776.42 → 3782.42] but also it's not just out there right it's really easy to assume that it's out there, but it's in here
[3782.42 → 3791.22] too isn't it most of us if we're honest spend our lives trying to rule our own little kingdoms at the
[3791.22 → 3797.86] kingdom of career the kingdom of school or soccer the kingdom of family the kingdom of comfort or
[3797.86 → 3806.58] control we carefully curate our lives how we present ourselves online how we decorate our homes how we
[3806.58 → 3813.78] schedule our days just to keep the illusion going that we are in control we protect our reputations
[3813.78 → 3821.94] we plan our futures we trace we chase dreams that we are told will fill us full, but it's exhausting
[3824.74 → 3829.62] what we see over and over again or at least what I see in this right is that the more we try to hold
[3829.62 → 3837.78] it all together the more we feel it unravel around us anxiety creeps in disappointment lingers and what we
[3837.78 → 3845.62] thought was a modicum of control slips through our fingers like a vapour the world doesn't bend to our
[3845.62 → 3856.02] will, and it turns out neither does our own heart deep down in those quiet moments of disappointment
[3857.14 → 3859.70] our hearts whisper a longing
[3859.70 → 3872.74] if only there was a good king if only there was a true king one who sees me who saves me one who reigns
[3872.74 → 3875.30] not for power but in love
[3878.26 → 3884.34] even the littlest among us this morning have this prayer right have you ever wish that someone could just
[3884.34 → 3894.02] fix everything take all the wrong stuff away help you feel safe and seen help you feel loved that's
[3894.02 → 3904.42] what our hearts are longing for and that's exactly what the Gospel of Matthew declares for us, we are
[3904.42 → 3913.54] calling this summer series behold your king because we don't just want to learn about Jesus we want you to
[3913.54 → 3922.26] see him we want you to encounter the living Jesus in these moments together to let the Holy Spirit open
[3922.26 → 3929.22] our eyes and soften our hearts so that through the word we're not just informed, but we are being transformed
[3930.82 → 3939.62] right this is more than a story about the past we want to see Jesus stepping into your present right now
[3939.62 → 3947.14] right here god entering your imagination the spirit inviting you to let go of your little kingdom
[3947.14 → 3954.98] and receive the joy and security and freedom of Jesus kingdom and so in these moments together
[3955.78 → 3963.78] it is my prayer that we might carve out a sacred space and that this would actually be
[3963.78 → 3971.62] a sort of liminal moment where heaven touches your heart and the king draws you near
[3974.18 → 3986.42] this morning we will see this through the first couple two chapters of Matthew where we see that Jesus is the
[3986.42 → 3995.94] true promised king the goal of god's covenant story the hope of the world and the lord who calls you to
[3995.94 → 4003.38] belong to him that's our big idea this morning that Jesus is the true promised king the goal of god's
[4003.38 → 4011.94] covenant story the hope of the world and the lord who calls you to belong to him and like I said we read
[4011.94 → 4017.62] specific verses, but we're going to look at the whole couple chapters and so it will be great if you have a
[4017.62 → 4027.06] bible in front of you to do that with if you do you will see that the first line of the Gospel of Matthew
[4027.06 → 4036.98] in chapter 1 verse 1 says this is the genealogy of Jesus the messiah the son of David the son of Abraham
[4036.98 → 4048.02] now in some ways this line is an echo of the first line of the bible right all the way back in genesis
[4048.02 → 4058.34] the first book of the bible the very first words of genesis 1 say in the beginning god created the
[4058.34 → 4071.38] the heavens and the earth in Matthew the word that's translated genealogy is the Greek word genesis
[4072.98 → 4084.10] which means origin or beginning the arrival of Jesus the messiah marks a new beginning for humanity
[4084.10 → 4091.38] right this is the continuation of the story that started all the way back in the garden that moved
[4091.38 → 4098.34] through Abraham and David and exile and silence and this is where it's all been headed
[4099.94 → 4105.46] even in the moments of god's hiddenness this has been moving through history
[4105.46 → 4114.42] and Jesus doesn't arrive on the scene out of nowhere as we read this we're building an anticipation he is
[4114.42 → 4120.18] the long expected one but even more than that what we begin to see is that he's the point of it all
[4120.74 → 4128.02] right every promise every covenant every longing every deliverance every prophet's cry throughout history
[4128.02 → 4138.02] all flows towards him and from the moment humanity fell in our relationship to god has been moving
[4138.02 → 4146.26] history towards healing towards reconciliation with him from the moment death entered the world god has
[4146.26 → 4154.10] been working resurrection into the plan and when Jesus comes onto the scene we don't just get a new chapter
[4154.10 → 4159.78] we get the central character we get the climax of it all the one who fulfills it the one who literally
[4159.78 → 4166.66] embodies it incarnates it in our midst the one who completes it, and he's not just another person in the
[4166.66 → 4175.06] story he is the goal of the story Jesus is what god has been doing from the beginning and so when we read
[4175.06 → 4183.38] the genealogy right we're not just reading a family tree we are witnessing the faithfulness of god across
[4183.38 → 4191.78] generations of god weaving a plan of grace through broken people and battered hopes until the day
[4191.78 → 4197.38] that heaven finally breaks open, and the king is born, and the angels sing
[4201.46 → 4209.30] now there's another thing to see in this genealogy we don't have time to get into all the particulars but
[4209.30 → 4220.42] we're going to read it quickly Jesus comes for all people and this is already conveyed in the genealogy Jew
[4220.42 → 4227.62] gentile moral immoral significant insignificant people of influence and people on the margins in fact
[4227.62 → 4232.34] especially for people who are insignificant by society's standards and on the margins
[4232.34 → 4241.14] as you read through this story you might see there that the story of Judah and Tamar for instance is
[4241.14 → 4252.58] incredibly salacious and like 14a maybe 18 plus right even by today's standards
[4254.42 → 4257.78] before coming to know the lord rehab was a prostitute
[4257.78 → 4266.34] many of the kings on this list in the genealogy did incredibly awful things Ahaz sacrificed his son
[4267.14 → 4274.82] Manasseh sacrificed his son but also practiced sorcery, and we read in second kings 21 filled Jerusalem
[4274.82 → 4275.94] with the blood of innocence
[4275.94 → 4280.74] this family tree
[4281.62 → 4282.74] is pretty ugly
[4285.22 → 4293.46] now you may think then as you sit here this morning that your past excludes you from the kingdom
[4294.50 → 4299.38] maybe you think that your family background rules you out maybe you think you're just not good enough
[4299.38 → 4308.82] or smart enough or well enough the kingdom of Jesus though will encompass many more people than you can
[4308.82 → 4314.58] imagine in fact someone once said and I tried to figure out this week, but it turns out it's one of
[4314.58 → 4318.82] those quotes that just live in the ether, and so we can't attribute it to any one person anymore
[4319.62 → 4325.14] but someone said that when you get to heaven you'll be surprised who you don't see there who you thought
[4325.14 → 4331.38] you probably would, and you'll be even more surprised by who you do see there who you thought you never
[4331.38 → 4341.46] should that's what's going on in this story right the beginning of the Gospel of Matthew is showing
[4341.46 → 4352.18] us just how broad and wide and deep is the love of god made available in Christ Jesus big enough for you
[4352.18 → 4361.62] even you no matter your past or your history at the beginning of Matthew is also at pains to show us
[4361.62 → 4369.22] something about Jesus and how the messiah is connected to the line of David right and the point here
[4369.94 → 4379.06] I believe is to underscore the royal lineage of Jesus that he is the true king that Jesus is the son
[4379.06 → 4389.14] of David Matthew uses the title son of David nine times for Jesus god promised David that one of his
[4389.14 → 4397.70] descendants would be established on a throne forever you can read that in second Samuel 7 and this promise
[4397.70 → 4406.02] shapes the longings of Israel for generations and generations both through and after the exile
[4406.02 → 4412.90] and the genealogy together with the story of the visit from the magi which comes after what we read
[4413.94 → 4420.26] who were searching for the king of the Jews tying that to Palm Sunday narrative where people shout
[4420.26 → 4428.18] hosanna to the son of David all of these point to the fact that Jesus is the true and better king he's the
[4428.18 → 4437.22] long-expected king and this is a major theme for Matthew in this story all of Israel's longings all the
[4437.22 → 4445.54] anticipations of god's people for a messiah king a new anointed ruler are fulfilled in Jesus
[4447.06 → 4455.94] and the rest of the gospel story shows us just what kind of king he will be and what it means to live in his kingdom
[4458.18 → 4466.10] this shows us early what kind of king Jesus is right not one who seizes power but one who descends in
[4466.10 → 4478.98] humility and when Herod hears from the magi of this child king he responds with violence and fear
[4478.98 → 4490.82] but Jesus comes not with swords but for suffering right and from that cradle in the manger to the
[4490.82 → 4500.18] cross the kingship of Jesus confounds expectations right he doesn't rule from a throne but joins his
[4500.18 → 4510.26] people in a manger and later demonstrates his rule from a tree this is the king who conquers by being
[4510.26 → 4522.90] conquered right whose crown is not made of gold but of thorns and from the beginning we can see that god is
[4522.90 → 4533.06] faithful to his faithful to his promises that god can be trusted to keep his promises right in the genealogy
[4533.06 → 4542.10] in the story to the angel to Joseph and in the visit of the magi we see right beginning with god's promise
[4542.10 → 4548.42] to abraham is a huge figure in the Old Testament he's the first of the three great patriarchs
[4548.42 → 4558.58] Abraham Isaac and Jacob and god promised Abram in genesis 12 both a land and a seed and god promised
[4558.58 → 4566.18] that through his descendants he would be a blessing to the nations and in the genealogy of Jesus we see
[4566.18 → 4573.78] that he is the seed of Abraham and being united to Christ by believing in him that's what makes us now heirs
[4573.78 → 4581.54] of Abraham and that's why the bible calls Abraham the father of all who believe in Romans 4 11.
[4583.06 → 4589.14] see the story of Abraham and there is the story of Jesus through him is not just about one family in
[4589.14 → 4596.50] one land it's about blessing all nations that's why Jesus will end the Gospel of Matthew with a global
[4596.50 → 4605.22] commission right to go into all nations and make disciples the promise of Abraham and the mission
[4605.22 → 4612.74] of the church are two sides of the same coin Jesus is not only the fulfillment of the promise he is the
[4612.74 → 4615.78] expansion of the promise to the ends of the earth
[4615.78 → 4618.50] the promise of the ancient city of Abraham and in the first place in the first place in the first place
[4618.50 → 4629.14] and I think this last idea here is connected to the idea that we get in Jesus name Jesus means
[4629.14 → 4639.22] he will save his people from their sins the Hebrew name there is Jeshua modern day is Joshua the Greek
[4639.22 → 4649.14] version is Jesus, from which we get Jesus. Jeshua means Yahweh saves. And we're also told that in
[4649.14 → 4653.96] this part of the story, he will also be called Emmanuel, which is another Hebrew word meaning
[4653.96 → 4660.10] God with us. That's why this church is named Emmanuel, because God is with us here and now.
[4661.76 → 4668.24] And introducing this name, especially this last one, is a refrain that will be repeated
[4668.24 → 4676.50] throughout this opening section of Matthew. All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said
[4676.50 → 4682.48] through the prophet. Now, a version of this shows up four more times in this section.
[4683.12 → 4689.52] Once about where he would be born in Bethlehem, once about his fleeing to Egypt to escape Herod,
[4689.76 → 4695.36] another time about all the weeping in the land after Herod killed the baby boys two years old and
[4695.36 → 4702.14] younger. And then lastly, in his move to Nazareth, fulfilling what the prophets would say about him
[4702.14 → 4712.90] being a Nazarene. That's in chapter 2, verse 23. The point of all of this, that Jesus is the long-expected
[4712.90 → 4723.60] Messiah King. He is the promised fulfillment of God's work in the world. And he fulfills God's
[4723.60 → 4732.94] promises not only by arriving, but by laying down his life. This is the gospel at the heart of Jesus'
[4732.94 → 4740.00] story. And I pray that it turns out to be the answer to the ache in our own story.
[4741.16 → 4747.96] Even though we are more sinful than we could ever dare admit or acknowledge, we are more loved by God
[4747.96 → 4756.06] than we could ever imagine possible. And out of that love, Jesus came into the world and lived the
[4756.06 → 4761.46] life that we should have lived, fulfilling the demands of God's law with perfect righteousness.
[4762.18 → 4769.08] And he died the death that we deserve, taking the punishment for our sin upon his shoulders on the
[4769.08 → 4778.08] cross. This is the kind of king that Jesus is. Not just righteous for his own sake, but righteous for
[4778.08 → 4786.86] ours. Not just bearing a crown of glory, but wearing a crown of thorns. Jesus is the king who trades places
[4786.86 → 4794.62] with his people. He saves not by domination, but by substitution. He reigns not by taking life, but by giving
[4794.62 → 4804.80] his own. And that's why he's the answer to our deepest longings for forgiveness, for justice, for peace,
[4804.80 → 4814.16] for a love that will never end, a love that will never let us go. Each fulfillment of these opening
[4814.16 → 4823.80] chapters is more than a prediction. It's a declaration. A declaration that says God is still speaking.
[4823.80 → 4832.40] God is still acting. God is still with us. The scriptures are not just an ancient record. They are the
[4832.40 → 4839.86] living voice of God, tracing the providence of God through history and teaching his people his voice to
[4839.86 → 4847.82] know him more. Matthew doesn't just want us to see what God did. He wants us to see and hear, to know, and to
[4847.82 → 4857.12] believe, to believe, to witness, and to be a part of what God is doing in Jesus even now, today, in this place.
[4861.88 → 4863.86] Now, the way I do this in my own life
[4863.86 → 4871.82] is to constantly, prayerfully, be on the lookout for God's activity around me,
[4871.82 → 4880.10] God's activity in me and through me. One of my favourite questions to ask people is, is how have you
[4880.10 → 4888.42] seen God show up lately? Right? I think we need to get better at seeing God at work. And one of the ways
[4888.42 → 4895.70] that we do that is by asking others how they see God at work. How have you seen God at work in your life?
[4895.70 → 4903.98] Equally important, where do you need to see Jesus at work in your life right now?
[4906.40 → 4911.96] Next, I want to do something a little bit out of the ordinary, but I want to just take a moment,
[4913.14 → 4919.48] and I want you to do that. Just reflect in your heart, in your imagination right now,
[4919.48 → 4926.70] on how you've seen God at work. And then maybe, if you're willing, pray a prayer that says,
[4926.82 → 4932.96] Jesus, I need you to show up here. And so reflect in your heart, how have you seen God at work?
[4933.66 → 4935.52] Where do you need him to show? Do that right now.
[4935.52 → 4935.56] Do that right now.
[4949.48 → 4972.58] Hold that question.
[4975.16 → 4976.26] Hold that prayer.
[4976.26 → 5006.24] Hold that prayer.
[5006.26 → 5007.90] End quote.
[5009.66 → 5016.74] The moment that you say Jesus is God, you are saying that what the Bible says is true.
[5018.20 → 5022.64] You are saying that what Jesus says about himself is true.
[5023.86 → 5030.66] And if what Jesus has said about himself is true, then it is also true that there is no other person
[5030.66 → 5034.86] by whom we can be made right with God except Jesus.
[5034.86 → 5043.46] And so asking, who is Jesus, actually, for us this morning, turns into a pleading.
[5044.14 → 5048.18] A pleading. Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as your Saviour.
[5048.68 → 5052.86] Love him as your brother and serve him as your Messiah King.
[5052.86 → 5059.18] You see, if Jesus is God, then by his word you were created.
[5060.32 → 5069.32] If Jesus is God, because of him, everything that he has done in this world makes him alone worthy of our love
[5069.32 → 5071.46] and our devotion and our worship.
[5071.46 → 5076.22] He alone is worthy of our faithful obedience.
[5076.22 → 5090.50] And so with eyes of faith, behold your King.
[5090.50 → 5093.20] Look to him.
[5094.40 → 5098.02] In fact, right now, again, look in your own heart.
[5098.42 → 5099.96] Think in your own imaginations.
[5100.34 → 5102.28] Is Jesus your King?
[5103.18 → 5108.46] And hear him say this morning, you are mine.
[5108.46 → 5112.40] You are mine.
[5112.40 → 5117.06] You belong to me, body and soul, in life and in death.
[5118.52 → 5120.70] This is who Jesus is.
[5121.64 → 5124.56] He is the true and promised King.
[5124.70 → 5126.76] The goal of God's covenant story.
[5126.86 → 5127.96] The hope of the world.
[5128.34 → 5131.46] And the Lord who calls you to belong to him.
[5132.98 → 5134.60] Let me be abundantly clear.
[5134.96 → 5137.14] Jesus isn't just the King of the grown-ups.
[5138.46 → 5139.88] Kids, he's your King.
[5140.20 → 5141.18] He sees you.
[5141.64 → 5142.64] He knows your name.
[5142.76 → 5144.66] He loves it when you talk to him.
[5144.76 → 5148.32] And he loves you more than you could ever imagine possible.
[5149.86 → 5153.10] Jesus doesn't come to seize power but to give life.
[5153.10 → 5156.86] He doesn't come to reign from a palace but from a manger and a cross.
[5157.32 → 5159.14] Jesus doesn't just want your attention.
[5159.38 → 5160.42] He wants your heart.
[5161.98 → 5162.92] So trust him.
[5164.56 → 5165.86] Worship him.
[5167.00 → 5168.30] Follow him.
[5168.46 → 5170.80] Emmanuel.
[5170.80 → 5170.88] Emmanuel.
[5171.58 → 5173.52] God with us.
[5174.34 → 5177.04] Behold your King.
[5178.32 → 5178.92] Amen.
[5179.60 → 5180.74] Let's pray together.
[5180.74 → 5194.12] Lord Jesus, help us today at this moment to fix our eyes on you.
[5197.80 → 5204.26] Help us to no longer conform to the pattern of this world but to be transformed by the renewing of our minds.
[5204.26 → 5204.36] Help us.
[5208.04 → 5213.40] Help us to come to you because you have the words of eternal life.
[5217.72 → 5221.48] Help us to see you today.
[5221.48 → 5227.22] In Jesus' name we pray.
[5227.22 → 5227.28] Amen.
[5228.62 → 5228.98] Amen.
[5228.98 → 5244.02] Why don't we all rise and offer these words together?
[5258.98 → 5273.98] By faith we see the hand of God in the light of creation's grand design,
[5273.98 → 5283.44] in the lives of those who prove His faithfulness,
[5283.44 → 5288.76] who walk by faith and not by sight.
[5290.48 → 5295.54] By faith our fathers roam the earth,
[5295.54 → 5303.22] with the power of His promise in their hearts.
[5303.98 → 5311.02] Of a holy city built by God's own heaven,
[5311.02 → 5316.30] a place where peace and justice reign.
[5317.22 → 5322.70] We will stand as children of the promise,
[5324.06 → 5330.66] we will fix our eyes on Him, our souls reward,
[5330.66 → 5337.70] till the race is finished, and the work is done.
[5337.70 → 5343.54] He'll walk by faith and not by sight.
[5343.54 → 5354.58] By faith the prophets saw a day,
[5354.58 → 5360.58] when the longed for Messiah would appear,
[5360.58 → 5369.30] with the power to break the chains of sin and death,
[5369.30 → 5374.74] and rise triumphant from the grave.
[5374.74 → 5380.90] By faith the church was called to go,
[5380.90 → 5388.90] in the power of the Spirit to the lost,
[5388.90 → 5396.50] to deliver captives and to preach good news,
[5396.50 → 5401.72] in every corner of the earth.
[5401.72 → 5408.76] We will stand as children of the promise,
[5408.76 → 5415.70] we will fix our eyes on Him, our souls reward,
[5415.70 → 5422.76] till the race is finished, and the work is done.
[5422.76 → 5429.80] We will walk by faith and not by sight.
[5429.80 → 5439.80] By faith the mountain shall be moved,
[5439.80 → 5446.84] and the power of the gospel shall prevail.
[5446.84 → 5452.84] For we know in Christ all things are possible,
[5452.84 → 5458.84] for all who call upon His name.
[5458.84 → 5465.88] We will stand as children of the promise,
[5465.88 → 5472.88] we will fix our eyes on Him, our souls reward,
[5472.88 → 5480.88] till the race is finished, and the work is done.
[5480.88 → 5485.88] We will walk by faith and not by sight.
[5485.88 → 5505.32] In just a moment, you are sent out, commissioned by God,
[5505.32 → 5508.12] to proclaim Jesus to the world,
[5508.12 → 5510.84] and God goes with us in His blessing.
[5510.84 → 5515.12] I invite you to connect with a couple of the deacons
