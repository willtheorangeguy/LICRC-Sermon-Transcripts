• Introduction to a new series based on 1st and 2nd Thessalonians
• The Thessalonian church's hope for Jesus' return was a central part of their faith
• This hope gave them courage, shaped their priorities, and motivated their actions
• Paul's letters to the Thessalonians explore how this hope should transform everyday life
• Christians are often criticized for being apathetic towards the world due to a misconception about their belief in Jesus' return
• In reality, faith in Jesus' resurrection and future return empowers believers to care about the world and its people
• The city of Thessalonica was a major seaport in ancient Macedonia with a diverse population, including Jews and Greeks.
• Paul's preaching in the synagogue for three weeks had a significant impact, converting some Jews and many God-fearing Greeks and prominent women.
• A group of Jews caused trouble, charging believers with saying there is a king other than Caesar, leading to Paul and Silas leaving Thessalonica.
• Timothy was sent back to Thessalonica to check on the believers, and his encouraging report from Corinth led to the writing of 1st Thessalonians.
• 2nd Thessalonians was written in response to worsening persecution and hardship for the church.
• Both letters emphasize the importance of staying strong and enduring through faith in Jesus Christ's return.
• Paul uses the hope of Christ's return as a means of grace to sustain believers in the present.
• The importance of following God's way and persevering in the narrow path
• The concept of identity in Christ and how it differs from modern self-discovery
• Jesus' approach to transforming individuals, rather than helping them become their best selves
• The idea that our identities are defined by our relationship with God, not through individualism or self-discovery
• The offence of the gospel and its potential to challenge cultural assumptions about identity and self
• Whether one's identity is in themselves or in Christ
• The significance of greetings and addresses in letters as a way of defining relationships and identities.
• The definition of "church" and its significance in identity
• Paul's greetings in his letters as a representation of relationships
• Identity as the bride of Christ and being set apart for God's purposes
• Church as an all-inclusive, plural community and body
• Belonging to one another and the local church
• The expression of the Catholic Church in local churches
• Being Christian requires belonging to a local church
• Connection to a church marks connection to God through Jesus
• The gift of God is grace alone, and it's the truth of the gospel that Jesus Christ, God himself, came into the world to live the life we should have lived and died for our sins.
• The result of grace is peace, and living in peace is made alive in us by more grace being manifested in the hope of Christ's return.
• The gospel transforms people and cities, and those who gather as the church are sent out to transform others through their message of hope in Jesus.
• Waiting for Jesus fuels our mission, and our waiting is not idle, but we are commissioned to share this message with others.
• This message alone has the power to transform the world.
• We go into this week and year knowing that God goes with us, with his church, and with the prayers of the saints.
