[869.92 --> 899.90]  Thank you.
[899.90 --> 929.88]  Love and purity.
[929.88 --> 959.86]  Holy, holy, holy,
[959.86 --> 978.62]  O Lord, my rock and my redeemer,
[978.62 --> 986.26]  greatest treasure of my longing soul,
[986.26 --> 994.06]  my God, like you there is no other,
[995.32 --> 1001.50]  true delight is found in you alone.
[1002.16 --> 1009.38]  Your grace, a well too deep to fathom,
[1009.38 --> 1016.38]  your love exceeds the heaven's reed,
[1017.88 --> 1023.70]  your truth, a fount of perfect wisdom,
[1024.92 --> 1031.86]  my highest good and my unending need.
[1031.86 --> 1042.60]  O Lord, my rock and my redeemer,
[1043.54 --> 1049.86]  strong defender of my weary heart,
[1051.60 --> 1057.26]  my sword to fight the cruel deceiver,
[1057.26 --> 1065.46]  and my shield against its equal eyes.
[1066.32 --> 1072.26]  My song when enemies surround me,
[1073.20 --> 1079.26]  my hope when times of sorrow thrive,
[1079.26 --> 1086.38]  my joy when trials are abounding,
[1086.94 --> 1094.26]  your faithfulness, my refuge in the night.
[1098.26 --> 1104.26]  O Lord, my rock and my redeemer,
[1104.26 --> 1112.26]  gracious Savior of my ruined life,
[1112.26 --> 1119.26]  my guilt and cross laid on your shoulders,
[1119.26 --> 1126.26]  in my place you suffered, let and die.
[1126.26 --> 1134.26]  You rose, the grave and never conquered.
[1134.26 --> 1141.26]  You broke my bonds of sin and shame.
[1141.26 --> 1148.26]  You rose, the grave and never conquered.
[1148.26 --> 1149.26]  You rose, the grave and never conquered.
[1149.26 --> 1150.26]  You rose, the grave and never conquered.
[1150.26 --> 1155.26]  You rose, my bonds of sin and shame.
[1155.26 --> 1162.26]  O Lord, my rock and my redeemer,
[1162.26 --> 1167.26]  may all my days be glory to your name.
[1167.26 --> 1171.26]  Glory to your name.
[1185.26 --> 1188.10]  I invite you to have a seat for a moment.
[1188.10 --> 1189.10]  Amen.
[1189.10 --> 1190.10]  Amen.
[1190.10 --> 1193.10]  We have a unique opportunity this morning,
[1193.10 --> 1196.10]  and so we're going to break away
[1196.10 --> 1199.10]  from our normal rhythms of worship
[1199.10 --> 1203.10]  to acknowledge a thing that God has been doing among us
[1203.10 --> 1205.10]  and that God continues to do among us
[1205.10 --> 1209.10]  and to cover that over in prayer.
[1209.10 --> 1218.10]  This morning we have a chance to pray over Liam and Matt and Nicole
[1218.10 --> 1221.10]  and Rob and Brenda and all of their families
[1221.10 --> 1227.10]  as Matt and Nicole are becoming guardians for Liam
[1227.10 --> 1230.10]  and are going to take on the joy and the responsibility,
[1230.10 --> 1235.10]  the heartache and the burden and the celebration of raising him.
[1235.10 --> 1240.10]  And we are blessed to have gotten to know and love Liam
[1240.10 --> 1243.10]  as a foster child to Rob and Brenda,
[1243.10 --> 1248.10]  and we are blessed that Matt and Nicole are no longer of this congregation
[1248.10 --> 1250.10]  but they're of our family, right?
[1250.10 --> 1252.10]  And so we celebrate with you guys
[1252.10 --> 1255.10]  and want to cover this moment in prayer.
[1256.10 --> 1258.10]  I'm going to invite Rob and Brenda
[1258.10 --> 1261.10]  and whoever else in the Alkema family who wants to come up,
[1261.10 --> 1263.10]  and Matt and Nicole and whoever else in your family
[1263.10 --> 1267.10]  wants to come up to the front here,
[1267.10 --> 1269.10]  and we're going to gather around you
[1269.10 --> 1272.10]  and lay hands on in worship.
[1272.10 --> 1286.10]  Move to the middle, because people are going to surround you in a moment.
[1286.10 --> 1294.10]  First of all, Rob and Brenda and the Alkema family wanted you all to know
[1294.10 --> 1298.10]  how grateful they are for you as church family
[1298.10 --> 1302.10]  and for the way that you have supported them and encouraged them
[1302.10 --> 1306.10]  and welcomed and loved Liam into this family.
[1307.10 --> 1311.10]  The way that you have helped to provide an incredibly stable,
[1311.10 --> 1314.10]  most of the time, community for him.
[1317.10 --> 1320.10]  And, as well, Matt and Nicole,
[1321.10 --> 1323.10]  we wanted to take this time
[1324.10 --> 1328.10]  and to cover over you in prayer
[1329.10 --> 1332.10]  as you embody the gospel for Liam now.
[1333.10 --> 1336.10]  As sons and daughters of this church family,
[1336.10 --> 1340.10]  we love that you have been called by God to this task.
[1341.10 --> 1342.10]  And we want to acknowledge that
[1342.10 --> 1344.10]  and encourage that with prayer.
[1345.10 --> 1346.10]  And so, as you guys are up here,
[1346.10 --> 1349.10]  elders, family members, supporters,
[1349.10 --> 1350.10]  come on up.
[1351.10 --> 1353.10]  We're going to lay our hands on them at this time.
[1354.10 --> 1355.10]  And so, maybe take a couple steps forward
[1355.10 --> 1357.10]  so people can get around behind.
[1357.10 --> 1366.10]  Yeah, Kevin's not wrong.
[1366.10 --> 1367.10]  There's going to be a lot of people,
[1367.10 --> 1368.10]  so make lots of room.
[1378.10 --> 1380.10]  If you're not here at the front,
[1380.10 --> 1381.10]  we encourage you, of course,
[1381.10 --> 1386.10]  just to hold your hand out as a mark of you also extending this blessing in prayer.
[1387.10 --> 1388.10]  Let's pray together.
[1391.10 --> 1395.10]  Father God, this morning we pray the words of the psalmist in Psalm 103.
[1396.10 --> 1398.10]  Bless the Lord, O my soul.
[1399.10 --> 1403.10]  All that is within me, bless his holy name.
[1404.10 --> 1407.10]  Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits,
[1408.10 --> 1409.10]  who forgives all your iniquity,
[1410.10 --> 1411.10]  who heals all your diseases,
[1411.10 --> 1413.10]  who redeems your life from the pit,
[1413.10 --> 1416.10]  who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy,
[1416.10 --> 1421.10]  who satisfies you with good so that your youth is renewed like the eagles.
[1421.10 --> 1424.10]  Bless the Lord, O my soul.
[1425.10 --> 1429.10]  Lord God, our souls bless you today.
[1430.10 --> 1435.10]  We bless you for the gift that is Liam to us as a church family
[1435.10 --> 1441.10]  and to Matt and Nicole as they take increasing responsibility for his guardianship.
[1442.10 --> 1444.10]  And we pray that you would bless them.
[1445.10 --> 1454.10]  That the love that Liam has known and grown in here would just grow even more over these next days, weeks, months, and years.
[1454.10 --> 1461.10]  We thank you, God, for the privilege of walking with him, of loving him.
[1461.10 --> 1464.10]  And even as that changes for us here at Emmanuel,
[1464.10 --> 1469.10]  we know that it is your love that persists and goes with him.
[1469.10 --> 1477.10]  We thank you for Rob and Brenda and all the Alcuma family and what they have been as a gift to Liam
[1478.10 --> 1480.10]  and how they have modeled the gospel to him.
[1481.10 --> 1483.10]  And as that mantle now falls to Matt and Nicole,
[1483.10 --> 1487.10]  we pray that you would cause your face to shine upon them,
[1487.10 --> 1490.10]  that you would give them your grace and your peace,
[1490.10 --> 1497.10]  and that in all things they too would model and live this gospel of Jesus Christ.
[1498.10 --> 1502.10]  Father God, we celebrate your work among us
[1502.10 --> 1508.10]  and we ask for your spirit to continue to guide, lead, and shape this story
[1508.10 --> 1511.10]  in ways that are glorifying to you
[1512.10 --> 1515.10]  and in ways that just cause us to say,
[1515.10 --> 1518.10]  Bless the Lord, O my soul.
[1518.10 --> 1521.10]  Bless his holy name.
[1521.10 --> 1524.10]  All God's people said, Amen.
[1525.10 --> 1526.10]  Amen.
[1538.10 --> 1551.10]  Would you stand and join us in singing our next song?
[1551.10 --> 1572.10]  Restoring me the joy of my salvation.
[1572.10 --> 1579.10]  Restoring me the joy of my salvation.
[1579.10 --> 1582.10]  Take me back to where it all began.
[1582.10 --> 1587.10]  Take me back to where it all began.
[1587.10 --> 1600.10]  For all I ever wanted was your presence.
[1601.10 --> 1607.10]  How I long to be there once again.
[1607.10 --> 1616.10]  Like a fire that the world can burn out and play.
[1616.10 --> 1620.10]  Till nothing between us remains.
[1620.10 --> 1626.10]  My life is an altar to you.
[1626.10 --> 1628.10]  Renewing me a pure and willing spirit.
[1628.10 --> 1645.46]  Breathe in care, all the efforts that burn in my heart, a love taken back to the start, my life is an altar to you.
[1645.46 --> 1671.42]  Renewing me a pure and willing spirit, take me back to where it all began, before it all became so complicated.
[1675.46 --> 1701.10]  How I long to be there once again, like fire that the world can burn up and flame, till nothing between us reigns, my life is an altar to you.
[1701.10 --> 1719.10]  Breathe in care, all the efforts that burn in my heart, a love taken back to the start, my life is an altar to you.
[1719.10 --> 1738.10]  Now I'm sorry, please forgive me, for when I've gone cold, Lord I need you.
[1738.10 --> 1764.10]  How I need you, how I need you, to awake my soul, my heart, that the world can burn up and flame, till nothing between us reigns, my life is an altar to you.
[1764.10 --> 1782.10]  Breathe in care, all the efforts that burn in my heart, a love taken back to the start, my life is an altar to you.
[1782.10 --> 1811.10]  All the earth will shout your praise, our hearts will cry.
[1811.10 --> 1814.10]  These bones will cry, these bones will sing.
[1814.10 --> 1821.10]  Great are you, Lord.
[1821.10 --> 1832.10]  And all the earth will shout your praise, our hearts will cry, these bones will sing.
[1832.10 --> 1833.10]  Great are you, Lord.
[1833.10 --> 1834.10]  Great are you, Lord.
[1834.10 --> 1839.10]  Great are you, Lord.
[1839.10 --> 1847.10]  And all the earth will shout your praise, our hearts will cry, these bones will sing.
[1847.10 --> 1851.10]  Great are you, Lord.
[1851.10 --> 1852.10]  Great are you, Lord.
[1852.10 --> 1853.10]  Great are you, Lord.
[1853.10 --> 1858.10]  Great are you, Lord.
[1858.10 --> 1859.10]  Great are you, Lord.
[1859.10 --> 1860.10]  You're your grace, your love, so we pour out our praise, your hope.
[1860.10 --> 1861.10]  You're your grace, your love, so we pour out our praise, your hope.
[1861.10 --> 1863.10]  Oh
[1891.10 --> 1893.10]  Oh
[1921.10 --> 1940.34]  Join us together in speaking the truth through the Apostles Creed
[1940.34 --> 1947.60]  I believe in God, Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth
[1947.60 --> 1952.44]  I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord
[1952.44 --> 1957.58]  Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary
[1957.58 --> 1963.60]  He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried
[1963.60 --> 1965.62]  He descended to hell
[1965.62 --> 1968.92]  The third day he rose again from the dead
[1968.92 --> 1974.96]  He ascended to heaven and is seated at the bright hand of God the Father Almighty
[1974.96 --> 1979.12]  From there he will come to judge the living and the dead
[1979.12 --> 1984.40]  I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church
[1984.40 --> 1988.52]  The communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins
[1988.52 --> 1992.74]  The resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting
[1992.74 --> 1993.96]  Amen
[1993.96 --> 2016.04]  In this time of desperation
[2016.04 --> 2024.24]  When all we know is doubt and fear
[2024.24 --> 2030.78]  There is only one foundation
[2030.78 --> 2033.78]  We believe
[2033.78 --> 2037.78]  We believe
[2037.78 --> 2038.78]  We believe
[2038.78 --> 2045.12]  In this broken generation
[2045.12 --> 2052.78]  When all is dark you help us see
[2052.78 --> 2059.78]  There is only one foundation
[2059.78 --> 2060.78]  There is only one salvation
[2060.78 --> 2061.78]  There is only one salvation
[2061.78 --> 2062.78]  We believe
[2062.78 --> 2063.78]  We believe
[2063.78 --> 2065.78]  We believe
[2065.78 --> 2067.78]  We believe
[2067.78 --> 2069.78]  We believe
[2069.78 --> 2070.78]  We believe
[2070.78 --> 2071.78]  In God the Father
[2071.78 --> 2072.78]  We believe
[2072.78 --> 2073.78]  We believe
[2073.78 --> 2074.78]  In Jesus Christ
[2074.78 --> 2076.78]  We believe
[2076.78 --> 2078.78]  In the Holy Spirit
[2078.78 --> 2082.78]  And he's giving us new life
[2082.78 --> 2083.78]  We believe
[2083.78 --> 2085.78]  In the crucifixion
[2085.78 --> 2086.78]  We believe
[2086.78 --> 2089.78]  That he comforted death
[2089.78 --> 2090.78]  We believe
[2090.78 --> 2091.78]  We believe
[2091.78 --> 2092.78]  We believe
[2092.78 --> 2094.78]  We believe
[2094.78 --> 2095.78]  We believe
[2095.78 --> 2096.78]  In the resurrection
[2096.78 --> 2097.78]  And he's coming back again
[2097.78 --> 2100.78]  We believe
[2100.78 --> 2101.78]  We believe
[2101.78 --> 2102.78]  We believe
[2103.78 --> 2116.78]  So let our faith be more than that God
[2116.78 --> 2130.78]  we believe
[2133.82 --> 2142.78]  we believe in jesus
[2146.78 --> 2151.74]  we believe
[2153.50 --> 2159.78] ане
[2159.78 --> 2168.32]  Let the lost be found and the dead be raised in the here and now.
[2168.32 --> 2171.88]  Let the blood in vain, let the church live out.
[2172.12 --> 2176.66]  Our God will say we believe, we believe.
[2176.86 --> 2180.44]  And the gates of hell will not prevail.
[2180.60 --> 2184.04]  For the power of God has torn the veil.
[2184.14 --> 2187.56]  Though we know your love will never fail.
[2187.56 --> 2194.30]  We believe, we believe, we believe in God the Father.
[2194.30 --> 2197.30]  We believe in Jesus Christ.
[2198.14 --> 2201.42]  We believe in the Holy Spirit.
[2202.20 --> 2205.30]  And He's given us new lives.
[2205.62 --> 2208.30]  We believe in the crucifixion.
[2208.96 --> 2211.30]  We believe that He conquered death.
[2212.48 --> 2215.48]  We believe in the resurrection.
[2215.48 --> 2218.04]  Today He's coming back.
[2218.38 --> 2220.44]  He's coming back again.
[2225.22 --> 2228.46]  He's coming back again.
[2230.22 --> 2235.08]  We believe, we believe.
[2235.08 --> 2235.68]  We believe.
[2245.48 --> 2258.96]  Good morning.
[2258.96 --> 2259.02]  Good morning.
[2260.22 --> 2267.38]  As part of our process for elders and deacons,
[2267.38 --> 2278.54]  this morning, we have the opportunity to place an X beside all those people that we affirm
[2278.54 --> 2283.28]  for the office of elder and deacon.
[2284.34 --> 2287.12]  This vote is actually required.
[2287.12 --> 2289.60]  So that's why we're going through this process.
[2289.60 --> 2293.98]  But it's not the vote to install either one.
[2294.08 --> 2296.76]  So you just put an X beside every name,
[2296.90 --> 2302.86]  unless you feel that you have to say no for one reason or another.
[2304.48 --> 2307.18]  A couple of elders are going to come up front here, please.
[2307.18 --> 2309.68]  And hand out these ballots.
[2311.04 --> 2316.12]  And then we have some just before we do that, before the offering this morning.
[2317.88 --> 2319.12]  Dick is here already.
[2319.34 --> 2322.16]  Can we, Dave, you want to come up front and clarity, please?
[2322.16 --> 2336.62]  So once you've filled out the ballot, fold it in half, please,
[2336.68 --> 2339.28]  and put it in the offering bag as it comes by.
[2340.38 --> 2341.94]  And then that way they'll be collected.
[2342.54 --> 2348.18]  And then a couple of elders will afterwards sort them out and count everything.
[2348.18 --> 2355.30]  Next week will be the drawing of the lots of the names.
[2355.40 --> 2357.34]  So we put the names in a bag.
[2358.20 --> 2363.46]  And then because we have more than one person for each position that needed,
[2364.78 --> 2369.06]  those names will be drawn next week during the service.
[2378.18 --> 2393.40]  Who's ever coming up for the deacons now can come up and give that announcement.
[2396.24 --> 2396.68]  Pearl?
[2396.68 --> 2396.74]  Pearl?
[2401.74 --> 2402.46]  Yeah, yeah.
[2402.64 --> 2407.68]  The fold up the ballot and place it in the bags, the offering bag, as it comes by.
[2408.18 --> 2408.68]  Okay.
[2421.18 --> 2421.50]  Okay.
[2421.68 --> 2425.02]  So while we're doing that, we'll also introduce the offering.
[2426.50 --> 2430.30]  First of all, a reminder that we are participating in the Baby Bottle Campaign,
[2430.68 --> 2436.62]  which is in coordination with the Hope for Women Pregnancy Center.
[2436.62 --> 2439.10]  And we're about halfway through that campaign.
[2439.20 --> 2442.34]  It started Mother's Day, will end on Father's Day.
[2442.46 --> 2449.70]  And if you haven't yet joined in this campaign, then you can pick up a baby bottle that's in the back on the booth in the foyer.
[2449.70 --> 2456.70]  And the idea is that you fill it with loonies, toonies, paper, money, bills, checks.
[2457.22 --> 2459.94]  And then they are returned on Father's Day.
[2460.46 --> 2464.52]  And then the deacons will see to it that it gets to the Hope for Women's Pregnancy Center.
[2464.52 --> 2474.28]  This center is a place where women who are experiencing unexpected, unplanned, troublesome pregnancies can go for counseling,
[2474.28 --> 2478.48]  for support, and for some practical aid as well.
[2478.48 --> 2484.46]  And this center supports until the children that are born are about two years of age.
[2484.46 --> 2488.02]  So it's a great way to support life.
[2488.46 --> 2499.10]  And also it's a way of dealing with all those loonies and toonies that have a way of collecting in various pockets and purses and bowls and whatnot in our homes
[2499.10 --> 2502.50]  that you can actually then just give them away to the pregnancy center.
[2502.62 --> 2511.28]  And all the bottles will be recorded by who gave them so that you can get a tax receipt for them as well.
[2511.28 --> 2522.40]  So, and then the offering today, not only in the bags do we place our vote, but today's offering today is for the budget.
[2522.96 --> 2524.82]  So this is called Budget Sunday.
[2525.48 --> 2533.60]  We're not quite halfway through the fiscal year, but it's a good time to pause and reflect how we're doing.
[2533.88 --> 2540.98]  And in communication with Marilyn this past week, we're doing pretty good, but we are about 15% behind in our giving.
[2541.28 --> 2547.44]  So if we do the math, that means by November, which is when you get all these annoying announcements,
[2547.44 --> 2553.86]  if you keep up this trend, then by November we'll be behind by 30%.
[2553.86 --> 2558.54]  So think of ways that you can top up your giving now.
[2559.00 --> 2565.58]  And also, especially since the summer months tend to be a little leaner in donations as we're all on vacation and whatnot.
[2565.58 --> 2574.50]  So reminder that the budget is for the ministries of this church and also for the greater church ministries through our ministry shares.
[2574.50 --> 2604.48]  Thank you.
[2604.50 --> 2632.88]  Thank you.
[2632.88 --> 2634.88]  I want to see you.
[2636.22 --> 2639.88]  Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[2640.76 --> 2643.68]  Open the eyes of my heart.
[2644.14 --> 2646.88]  I want to see you.
[2648.22 --> 2651.24]  I want to see you.
[2652.36 --> 2656.50]  See you, Father, and stand it up.
[2658.20 --> 2660.92]  Shining in the light of your glory.
[2660.92 --> 2662.92]  Shining in the light of your glory.
[2662.92 --> 2665.16]  Throw out your power and love.
[2665.56 --> 2669.48]  As we sing holy, holy, holy.
[2673.34 --> 2676.46]  Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[2677.68 --> 2679.92]  Open the eyes of my heart.
[2680.94 --> 2683.64]  I want to see you.
[2685.02 --> 2687.98]  I want to see you.
[2687.98 --> 2693.98]  Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[2694.94 --> 2697.64]  Open the eyes of my heart.
[2698.22 --> 2700.98]  I want to see you.
[2702.14 --> 2705.26]  I want to see you.
[2706.30 --> 2709.98]  See you, Father, and stand it up.
[2709.98 --> 2713.48]  I want to see you.
[2713.48 --> 2713.90] í
[2714.06 --> 2728.28]  enjoy it's the idea you know and Tout
[2728.28 --> 2732.26]  this is where you dream come true.
[2732.26 --> 2741.26]  Holy, Holy, Holy
[2741.26 --> 2747.26]  Holy, Holy, Holy
[2747.26 --> 2752.26]  Holy, Holy, Holy
[2752.26 --> 2756.26]  Holy, Holy, Holy
[2756.26 --> 2760.26]  I want to see you
[2762.26 --> 2766.26]  Holy, Holy, Holy
[2766.26 --> 2770.26]  Holy, Holy, Holy
[2770.26 --> 2774.26]  Holy, Holy, Holy
[2774.26 --> 2778.26]  I want to see you
[2792.26 --> 2810.26]  Good morning, everyone. If you are a child, age three up to grade four. I'd like to invite you to come on up to the front for kids corner before we head off to children's worship time.
[2810.26 --> 2816.50]  I know we're going to be missing a few people because it's cadet camp this weekend, right?
[2816.56 --> 2819.16]  So some of the boys, the older boys are gone.
[2823.90 --> 2824.78]  All right.
[2825.48 --> 2830.50]  So we started talking last week about something called training.
[2830.64 --> 2832.42]  Does anyone know what training is?
[2832.46 --> 2834.42]  What does it mean if you're training for something?
[2836.16 --> 2837.14]  What do you think, Ruby?
[2838.40 --> 2839.72]  You're getting ready for something.
[2839.72 --> 2843.08]  It's like when you practice for something so that you get better and better at it.
[2843.62 --> 2844.50]  Okay, another question.
[2845.04 --> 2846.96]  Can anyone tell me what muscles are?
[2847.86 --> 2850.26]  Not the food, the other kind of muscles.
[2850.68 --> 2851.06]  Karis.
[2852.66 --> 2853.84]  Something that makes you strong.
[2853.92 --> 2854.14]  Exactly.
[2854.24 --> 2856.54]  They're a part of your body that we can't see, but they're underneath.
[2856.70 --> 2858.80]  They're all over our body, and they help make us strong.
[2858.92 --> 2863.34]  And did you know you can make your muscles stronger by training, by practicing?
[2863.62 --> 2865.94]  So do you guys know what a sit-up is?
[2866.58 --> 2866.94]  Yeah.
[2867.02 --> 2867.98]  Can you do a sit-up?
[2868.38 --> 2868.60]  No.
[2868.60 --> 2869.98]  Can anyone do a sit-up?
[2870.74 --> 2871.82]  Okay, show me a sit-up.
[2871.86 --> 2873.46]  If you think you can do a sit-up, do a sit-up.
[2874.40 --> 2875.94]  Anybody can do this, just saying.
[2877.62 --> 2877.90]  Awesome.
[2878.10 --> 2878.56]  Yeah, see, look.
[2878.60 --> 2879.26]  Some of them can do a sit-up.
[2879.32 --> 2880.18]  How about a push-up?
[2880.62 --> 2881.34]  That's a little harder.
[2881.44 --> 2882.24]  Can anyone do a push-up?
[2882.30 --> 2882.64]  Try it.
[2882.68 --> 2882.98]  Show me.
[2883.12 --> 2884.10]  If you think you can do it.
[2884.64 --> 2886.56]  Again, anyone is welcome to do this.
[2887.06 --> 2887.98]  So there's some push-ups.
[2888.92 --> 2889.84]  Exercise time in the middle.
[2889.92 --> 2890.74]  Okay, awesome.
[2890.74 --> 2890.86]  Awesome.
[2891.22 --> 2893.08]  Which one's harder, a push-up or a sit-up?
[2894.74 --> 2895.84]  Some people think push-up.
[2895.84 --> 2897.76]  I think, I mean, I think a push-up's pretty hard.
[2898.32 --> 2901.58]  If you couldn't do a push-up, you know, if you practice doing push-ups every day, that
[2901.58 --> 2904.94]  you would get better and better, and you could do more and more push-ups, right?
[2904.94 --> 2909.48]  So we're going to be talking about how we can strengthen our faith today.
[2909.62 --> 2913.78]  So we can strengthen our muscles, but we can also strengthen our faith so that when we
[2913.78 --> 2919.42]  go through hard times, that our faith is strong, and how God can use those hard times to make
[2919.42 --> 2922.30]  our faith even stronger, kind of like training our muscles.
[2922.78 --> 2928.48]  So let's all stand up, and we'll do the blessing, and then we're going to head off to continue
[2928.48 --> 2928.90]  our learning.
[2928.90 --> 2929.20]  All right.
[2929.20 --> 2933.28]  All right.
[2934.06 --> 2936.10]  The Lord be with you.
[2936.32 --> 2938.12]  And also with you.
[2955.44 --> 2956.22]  Good morning.
[2956.22 --> 2961.34]  My name is Seth, and I am a pastoral elder here at our church, and I am not going to
[2961.34 --> 2964.74]  make you stand up and do jumping jacks or push-ups or anything.
[2965.10 --> 2968.30]  And I'm thankful that Nikki didn't extend that invitation to all of us for the other
[2968.30 --> 2969.00]  exercise, too.
[2969.64 --> 2973.58]  But we are going to approach God as one way of strengthening our faith.
[2973.68 --> 2975.58]  So please join me in our congregational prayer.
[2978.86 --> 2981.06]  Father in heaven, we thank you for this day.
[2981.70 --> 2985.90]  Thank you for the opportunity to gather together as your body to worship you.
[2985.90 --> 2987.58]  And magnify your holy name.
[2988.46 --> 2993.34]  Thank you for the reminder in Psalm 5 that by your great love, we can come into your house,
[2993.52 --> 2996.54]  and in reverence we can bow down toward your holy temple.
[2997.66 --> 3000.86]  We are grateful for all that you have done and continue to do.
[3001.34 --> 3004.48]  And each week as we gather, we remember together your goodness.
[3004.48 --> 3011.04]  We also remember and stand in awe of your power and faithfulness, claiming hold of the promise
[3011.04 --> 3014.74]  made in Psalm 5 that in the morning, Lord, you hear my voice.
[3015.38 --> 3018.94]  In the morning I lay my requests before you and wait expectantly.
[3019.70 --> 3022.02]  And we humbly bring these requests to you now.
[3022.02 --> 3026.22]  We pray for your blessing on the new marriage of Ben and Leanna Walsher.
[3026.84 --> 3031.04]  We pray that you will allow them to grow in their love for each other and for you.
[3032.02 --> 3036.30]  We also lift up all of the marriages in our church, and we ask that you will bless each
[3036.30 --> 3039.76]  and every one of them through whatever challenges or struggles they may be facing.
[3040.62 --> 3043.26]  May they find joy in loving you and each other.
[3043.26 --> 3048.76]  Father, we also pray for your continued blessing on the ministries of this church.
[3049.60 --> 3054.20]  Today we specifically lift up the cadets' ministry to you in thankfulness for another great year,
[3054.64 --> 3058.44]  and ask that you will continue to provide ways for the young boys of this church
[3058.44 --> 3060.90]  to learn about living lives of service for you.
[3062.24 --> 3064.64]  We also pray for a blessing on our church leadership.
[3065.32 --> 3068.66]  As we enter a time of changing season with our leadership,
[3069.00 --> 3071.28]  we thank you for providing a new slate of leaders.
[3071.28 --> 3074.24]  We ask for a blessing on that process moving forward,
[3074.52 --> 3077.48]  and that the new leadership will follow your guiding.
[3078.52 --> 3081.20]  We also pray for a blessing moving forward with Kevin,
[3081.42 --> 3085.30]  as we discern as a church our response to your call.
[3086.08 --> 3087.92]  Give us wisdom in that light as well.
[3089.86 --> 3092.36]  Lord Jesus, we ask that you will use your healing power
[3092.36 --> 3095.16]  in the lives of those who struggle with physical and mental health.
[3096.00 --> 3097.88]  We lift up Doug and Tessa,
[3098.12 --> 3100.56]  and ask that you will give them strength and endurance
[3100.56 --> 3102.44]  in their respective battles with cancer.
[3103.64 --> 3105.00]  We also pray for Tanya,
[3105.42 --> 3107.86]  and ask that you will allow her to experience joy
[3107.86 --> 3109.78]  in the knowledge of your faithful goodness
[3109.78 --> 3111.12]  in the midst of her struggle.
[3113.34 --> 3115.26]  We also pray for your healing power
[3115.26 --> 3117.02]  to reach into the hearts of all of us
[3117.02 --> 3118.66]  who struggle with our spiritual health.
[3119.40 --> 3121.40]  We pray again, like the psalmist,
[3121.40 --> 3123.02]  that you would lead us, Lord,
[3123.18 --> 3125.52]  in your righteousness because of our enemies.
[3126.12 --> 3127.94]  Make your way straight before us.
[3129.30 --> 3130.80]  Guide us so that we are not deceived,
[3131.24 --> 3132.52]  but that we may love the truth.
[3134.44 --> 3135.52]  And Lord, this morning,
[3135.66 --> 3137.12]  we ask for your comfort and peace
[3137.12 --> 3139.46]  for all of those who mourn the loss of loved ones.
[3139.46 --> 3142.90]  We especially pray for the Skipper and Whistlink families,
[3143.24 --> 3144.48]  that you will be very near to them
[3144.48 --> 3146.90]  during this difficult time after Rachel's loss.
[3147.82 --> 3151.44]  We thank you that your promises reach beyond the grave
[3151.44 --> 3154.16]  and give us the assurance of eternity with Christ.
[3155.10 --> 3156.64]  May we hold on to these promises
[3156.64 --> 3158.80]  as faithfully as you hold on to us.
[3158.80 --> 3162.00]  As the psalmist again writes,
[3162.62 --> 3164.74]  Let all who take refuge in you be glad.
[3165.42 --> 3166.76]  Let them ever sing for joy.
[3167.62 --> 3169.12]  Spread your protection over them,
[3169.30 --> 3172.10]  that those who love your name may rejoice in you.
[3172.90 --> 3174.70]  Surely, Lord, you bless the righteous.
[3175.24 --> 3177.70]  You surround them with your favor as with a shield.
[3179.36 --> 3181.10]  Bless us all as we are about to hear
[3181.10 --> 3182.22]  the preaching of your word.
[3182.82 --> 3185.06]  May we listen well to what your spirit tells us,
[3185.46 --> 3187.56]  love the truth, and so be saved.
[3188.80 --> 3191.64]  All this we humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ,
[3191.86 --> 3192.86]  our Lord and Savior.
[3193.66 --> 3193.96]  Amen.
[3214.74 --> 3217.04]  I know I've said this a number of times before,
[3217.04 --> 3220.24]  but it is so good to be with you.
[3220.32 --> 3224.06]  It is so good to gather and to worship our God.
[3224.76 --> 3228.28]  Our weekly worship together really does refresh my soul,
[3228.52 --> 3233.10]  and after weeks of anxiety and sharing concerns
[3233.10 --> 3238.58]  and hardship, after troubles and celebrations
[3238.58 --> 3241.26]  and entering into hard things,
[3241.26 --> 3245.34]  it is just a gift to gather and to worship our God
[3245.34 --> 3248.40]  and to sit in his presence and to hear from him.
[3249.18 --> 3251.02]  We're going to hear from God this morning
[3251.02 --> 3254.42]  as he speaks to us from 2 Thessalonians.
[3254.56 --> 3257.90]  We've been in a series through the books of Thessalonians.
[3258.74 --> 3260.96]  And at the off, I just want to warn you
[3260.96 --> 3262.56]  that this is one of those texts
[3262.56 --> 3265.84]  that probably isn't preached on a lot,
[3265.84 --> 3268.72]  but is speculated about a whole bunch.
[3269.52 --> 3271.06]  And there's some weird things in here.
[3271.48 --> 3273.52]  We're not going to cover over all of them.
[3273.64 --> 3276.70]  We just can't do that in our time together this morning.
[3277.42 --> 3280.22]  But I do want to encourage you to open up your Bible,
[3280.40 --> 3282.48]  to follow along, to have that there.
[3282.58 --> 3284.68]  And so if you don't have a Bible in hand,
[3285.04 --> 3286.18]  there's a few at the back.
[3286.26 --> 3287.02]  You can grab there,
[3287.02 --> 3291.14]  or you can turn your device and find the text there.
[3291.34 --> 3292.54]  The first time through,
[3292.68 --> 3294.48]  it will be on the screen behind me.
[3295.32 --> 3296.68]  But otherwise, I'm going to encourage you
[3296.68 --> 3298.44]  to have that in front of you as we go.
[3300.40 --> 3303.26]  We're going to read 2 Thessalonians 2,
[3303.70 --> 3304.80]  starting at verse 1,
[3304.84 --> 3306.52]  and we'll read through verse 12.
[3309.20 --> 3312.32]  Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[3312.32 --> 3314.66]  and our being gathered to him,
[3314.66 --> 3317.28]  we ask you, brothers and sisters,
[3317.74 --> 3320.66]  not to become easily unsettled or alarmed
[3321.24 --> 3324.08]  by the teaching allegedly from us,
[3324.44 --> 3327.50]  whether by a prophecy or by word of mouth or by letter,
[3328.08 --> 3331.62]  asserting that the day of the Lord has already come.
[3333.34 --> 3336.42]  Don't let anyone deceive you in any way,
[3337.02 --> 3340.50]  for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs
[3340.50 --> 3343.70]  and the man of lawlessness is revealed,
[3343.70 --> 3345.88]  the man doomed to destruction.
[3347.20 --> 3349.96]  He will oppose and will exalt himself
[3349.96 --> 3353.22]  over everything that is called God and is worshipped
[3353.22 --> 3356.74]  so that he sets himself up in God's temple,
[3357.20 --> 3359.22]  proclaiming himself to be God.
[3360.70 --> 3364.26]  Don't you remember that when I was with you,
[3364.34 --> 3365.96]  I used to tell you these things?
[3365.96 --> 3370.28]  And now you know what is holding him back
[3370.28 --> 3373.10]  so that he may be revealed at the proper time.
[3373.76 --> 3377.92]  For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work,
[3378.08 --> 3380.16]  but the one who now holds it back
[3380.16 --> 3383.92]  will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way.
[3384.68 --> 3387.72]  And then the lawless one will be revealed,
[3388.16 --> 3391.98]  whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth
[3391.98 --> 3394.68]  and destroy by the splendor of his coming.
[3395.86 --> 3399.98]  The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works.
[3400.78 --> 3404.82]  He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders
[3404.82 --> 3410.24]  that serve the lie and all the ways that wickedness deceives those who are perishing.
[3410.24 --> 3415.44]  They perish because they refuse to love the truth and so be saved.
[3416.44 --> 3419.86]  For this reason, God sends them a powerful delusion
[3419.86 --> 3421.92]  so that they will believe the lie
[3421.92 --> 3424.34]  and so that all will be condemned
[3424.34 --> 3429.16]  who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.
[3430.22 --> 3431.80]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3434.06 --> 3437.92]  I think for many of us, thanks be to God in that moment is,
[3438.36 --> 3439.26]  that's weird.
[3440.24 --> 3440.96]  Right?
[3441.04 --> 3442.70]  This is one of those texts, like I've said.
[3444.80 --> 3449.60]  Now, what if all of this,
[3450.90 --> 3453.34]  by this I mean everything we're doing here this morning,
[3453.88 --> 3456.62]  right, the singing, the praying, the longing for,
[3456.72 --> 3457.98]  the laying on of hands,
[3458.34 --> 3462.22]  what if all of this isn't true?
[3464.52 --> 3467.74]  What if this Jesus thing isn't real?
[3470.24 --> 3471.28]  What if this isn't true?
[3471.28 --> 3471.62]  Right?
[3471.66 --> 3472.32]  What we're doing here?
[3473.60 --> 3474.74]  Are we wasting our time?
[3477.02 --> 3478.24]  I mean, if it's not true, yeah.
[3479.08 --> 3479.48]  Absolutely.
[3480.18 --> 3480.30]  Right?
[3480.34 --> 3484.06]  The Apostle Paul says that if the resurrection of Jesus isn't true,
[3484.18 --> 3486.24]  which is foundational, core to what it means to be Christian,
[3486.52 --> 3488.58]  then Christians are most of all to be pitied.
[3488.58 --> 3492.32]  What if we missed something?
[3493.82 --> 3494.96]  What if we got it wrong?
[3496.76 --> 3496.96]  Right?
[3497.00 --> 3499.34]  And I'm not just talking about regular doubts here.
[3499.56 --> 3501.80]  I'm not just talking about questions that we might have.
[3502.04 --> 3504.08]  I mean, what if this isn't real?
[3504.08 --> 3510.20]  If this isn't real, we've all been lied to.
[3511.26 --> 3514.26]  If this isn't real, you pay me to lie to you.
[3518.38 --> 3521.80]  If this isn't real, we've missed something.
[3522.74 --> 3524.62]  And I don't know about you, but if this isn't real,
[3524.68 --> 3526.10]  my anxiety starts spiking.
[3526.10 --> 3532.12]  Now, there's all sorts of ways that we're told in our world, right,
[3532.16 --> 3534.02]  that we can bring down our anxiety.
[3534.24 --> 3537.98]  There's all sorts of ways that we can limit the impact of our worry.
[3538.20 --> 3540.20]  We can breathe deeply.
[3540.88 --> 3544.48]  We can practice intention or meditation.
[3544.88 --> 3546.98]  We can reevaluate our priorities.
[3547.40 --> 3548.98]  We can reeducate ourselves.
[3549.94 --> 3552.26]  And if it's not this, well,
[3552.26 --> 3555.64]  then maybe we better get on the right side of history
[3555.64 --> 3557.24]  and find a better answer.
[3559.16 --> 3560.98]  Now, whether you've wondered this
[3560.98 --> 3564.14]  or whether you've wondered something else that gives you anxiety,
[3564.70 --> 3566.86]  the question for all of us is,
[3567.16 --> 3568.30]  how do we handle it?
[3569.32 --> 3571.42]  How do we find out what's really real?
[3571.92 --> 3573.02]  What's really true?
[3575.54 --> 3578.96]  That question and its related impact
[3578.96 --> 3581.32]  is behind what we read about this morning.
[3582.44 --> 3585.36]  And if you look at the first couple verses that we read,
[3585.64 --> 3590.82]  it seems that either after Paul's first teaching on the matter
[3590.82 --> 3593.20]  or before even his first letter,
[3593.72 --> 3596.04]  other people, other teachers,
[3596.60 --> 3600.24]  had risen up in the community of the church of Thessalonians,
[3600.36 --> 3601.34]  of the Thessalonians,
[3601.34 --> 3605.60]  and have said that the return of Jesus has already taken place.
[3605.60 --> 3609.92]  You might remember from the first letter,
[3610.70 --> 3613.62]  in 1 Thessalonians 4, verse 16,
[3614.08 --> 3614.92]  we read that,
[3614.92 --> 3618.54]  the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a loud command,
[3618.66 --> 3619.92]  with the voice of the archangel,
[3620.02 --> 3621.20]  the trumpet call of God,
[3621.32 --> 3624.24]  and the dead in Christ will rise first.
[3625.20 --> 3626.26]  Now, notice there,
[3626.34 --> 3628.34]  and we made this point when we were looking at that text,
[3628.66 --> 3630.34]  the return of Jesus is visible,
[3630.60 --> 3631.28]  it is loud,
[3631.42 --> 3632.70]  and it is unmistakable.
[3632.70 --> 3634.50]  It won't be missed, right?
[3634.56 --> 3636.58]  Even the dead will rise when he comes.
[3636.82 --> 3638.12]  Point is, you won't miss it.
[3638.20 --> 3639.34]  It cannot be missed.
[3639.92 --> 3642.04]  And anyone who tries to tell you otherwise,
[3643.42 --> 3645.74]  right, anyone who tries to tell you that it's already happened,
[3646.62 --> 3647.86]  you can say,
[3648.24 --> 3648.40]  no.
[3649.38 --> 3650.34]  That's impossible.
[3650.84 --> 3652.00]  Because we would know.
[3652.80 --> 3654.70]  There's no secret to it.
[3654.70 --> 3656.94]  But,
[3657.18 --> 3658.36]  missing it
[3658.36 --> 3660.42]  is their anxiety.
[3662.36 --> 3663.92]  Being wrong about it
[3663.92 --> 3665.76]  is their fear.
[3666.62 --> 3666.72]  Right?
[3666.80 --> 3667.92]  What if we missed it?
[3668.58 --> 3669.94]  What if we're wrong?
[3670.20 --> 3671.06]  What if Paul lied?
[3671.32 --> 3672.66]  What if this isn't true?
[3673.76 --> 3674.86]  You see how that line works?
[3675.72 --> 3676.66]  That's their longing.
[3677.30 --> 3679.52]  That's the aching of their heart.
[3679.52 --> 3684.12]  What if all this Jesus thing isn't true?
[3685.82 --> 3687.02]  That's what Paul's addressing.
[3688.10 --> 3689.26]  And he gets at it right away.
[3689.54 --> 3692.52]  He gives us another reason why we can see that it's true.
[3692.96 --> 3695.08]  Verse 3 and 4, if you're looking at it.
[3695.38 --> 3695.44]  Right?
[3696.00 --> 3700.92]  This shows us another reason why the challenge to God's truthfulness can be overcome.
[3701.78 --> 3704.48]  He tells us what must happen first.
[3705.40 --> 3705.60]  Right?
[3705.64 --> 3708.62]  What must happen before the return of Jesus.
[3708.62 --> 3709.26]  He says,
[3709.68 --> 3712.02]  For that day will not come until...
[3712.02 --> 3713.80]  And then he lists two things.
[3714.70 --> 3714.84]  Right?
[3714.98 --> 3716.18]  The rebellion occurs
[3716.18 --> 3719.68]  and the man of lawlessness is revealed
[3719.68 --> 3722.66]  and sets himself up to be worshipped.
[3723.52 --> 3724.70]  Paul is saying,
[3725.56 --> 3727.30]  As you are discerning the truth,
[3727.76 --> 3728.88]  know this truth.
[3729.66 --> 3729.90]  Right?
[3729.96 --> 3732.18]  There are some things that have to yet happen
[3732.18 --> 3736.26]  before we can say this is taking place.
[3736.34 --> 3737.26]  There are some truths
[3737.26 --> 3738.42]  that you have to know
[3738.42 --> 3741.36]  that will help you make sense of this whole thing.
[3741.36 --> 3746.48]  That will help you understand the greater truth of this whole world
[3746.48 --> 3748.30]  and where history is heading.
[3749.36 --> 3752.86]  And one of the warning signs that Paul says
[3752.86 --> 3756.64]  is to be on the lookout for that rebellion.
[3756.64 --> 3758.22]  Now,
[3758.98 --> 3761.48]  that might be a strange word to you,
[3761.56 --> 3762.94]  especially in this context,
[3763.04 --> 3767.98]  as you know that the Christians are being persecuted by the Roman Empire.
[3768.66 --> 3770.78]  And if you are a Star Wars fan,
[3770.88 --> 3772.64]  you know that empire is bad
[3772.64 --> 3774.34]  and the rebellion is good.
[3776.04 --> 3777.58]  But that's not true in this text.
[3778.10 --> 3780.82]  The rebellion is not good.
[3780.82 --> 3782.54]  The word rebellion here
[3782.54 --> 3786.98]  is the word from where we get the word for apostasy.
[3787.88 --> 3788.10]  Right?
[3788.12 --> 3789.96]  It's the word that's used in the Bible
[3789.96 --> 3793.14]  to tell of a religious crisis
[3793.14 --> 3795.90]  that will face God's people.
[3796.76 --> 3800.58]  Apostasy is falling away into unbelief.
[3801.70 --> 3801.84]  Right?
[3801.84 --> 3802.82]  And so there's a crisis.
[3803.10 --> 3805.12]  This rebellion will be an apostasy
[3805.12 --> 3807.34]  of a whole slew of people
[3807.34 --> 3809.78]  who everyone thought were Christians.
[3810.38 --> 3811.26]  But turns out,
[3811.94 --> 3812.92]  they've fallen away.
[3813.48 --> 3814.12]  They don't believe.
[3814.88 --> 3817.28]  Jesus actually talks about this same thing
[3817.28 --> 3818.72]  in Matthew 24.
[3819.42 --> 3820.38]  Jesus says,
[3820.72 --> 3823.22]  when he's discussing the end times and last days,
[3823.76 --> 3824.86]  at that time,
[3825.22 --> 3827.50]  many will turn away from the faith
[3827.50 --> 3830.12]  and will betray and hate each other.
[3830.12 --> 3830.84]  Right?
[3832.04 --> 3833.06]  At some point,
[3833.76 --> 3835.96]  there will be a mass
[3835.96 --> 3840.28]  and noticeable turn away from true belief.
[3841.30 --> 3842.00]  Right?
[3842.02 --> 3843.28]  That's one of the markers
[3843.28 --> 3846.12]  that the return of Christ is coming.
[3847.10 --> 3847.50]  Right?
[3847.54 --> 3850.86]  A turn from true faith to a false faith.
[3851.76 --> 3852.20]  Right?
[3852.26 --> 3855.48]  From a true Messiah to a false Messiah.
[3856.80 --> 3858.44]  Now here's the tricky thing.
[3860.12 --> 3861.92]  Throughout church history,
[3862.48 --> 3867.56]  no apostate ever thought they were apostate.
[3869.02 --> 3869.74]  Right?
[3869.80 --> 3871.00]  The people who believe
[3871.00 --> 3873.86]  and who will follow this false Christ
[3873.86 --> 3874.78]  will likely,
[3875.16 --> 3876.64]  especially at first,
[3877.06 --> 3879.06]  think they're following the true Christ.
[3880.32 --> 3882.40]  They'll say things like,
[3882.90 --> 3886.74]  this is what real faith looks like
[3886.74 --> 3887.90]  in this hard moment.
[3887.90 --> 3891.48]  This is what it really means
[3891.48 --> 3892.62]  to be Christian
[3892.62 --> 3894.26]  in the world right now.
[3895.38 --> 3896.72]  They will say things like,
[3896.94 --> 3898.36]  for such a time as this,
[3898.54 --> 3899.54]  we have to do that.
[3901.42 --> 3901.94]  Right?
[3901.98 --> 3902.74]  They'll say things like,
[3902.90 --> 3903.98]  it may not be
[3903.98 --> 3905.66]  the best option,
[3906.18 --> 3907.66]  but it's the only one
[3907.66 --> 3908.36]  we really have.
[3910.28 --> 3910.80]  Now,
[3911.14 --> 3911.90]  a remnant,
[3912.12 --> 3912.52]  right,
[3912.58 --> 3913.68]  will not be deceived
[3913.68 --> 3915.32]  and they will know the truth,
[3915.96 --> 3918.18]  but especially at first,
[3919.28 --> 3920.40]  the apostates
[3920.40 --> 3922.32]  won't realize it.
[3923.04 --> 3924.74]  Those who fall to the rebellion
[3924.74 --> 3925.60]  won't know
[3925.60 --> 3927.20]  that's what is happening.
[3927.72 --> 3928.86]  And eventually,
[3929.70 --> 3932.34]  even if they figure it out,
[3932.90 --> 3934.08]  they won't care.
[3936.08 --> 3936.72]  Right?
[3936.72 --> 3937.04]  Now,
[3937.08 --> 3937.92]  the apostasy,
[3938.34 --> 3939.00]  this rebellion,
[3939.22 --> 3940.78]  will either coincide with,
[3940.90 --> 3941.68]  Paul says,
[3941.84 --> 3943.64]  or will most likely
[3943.64 --> 3944.90]  be caused by
[3944.90 --> 3946.16]  the revealing
[3946.16 --> 3947.46]  of the man
[3947.46 --> 3948.62]  of lawlessness.
[3949.66 --> 3949.88]  Now,
[3949.96 --> 3951.10]  some translations
[3951.10 --> 3951.76]  of the Bible,
[3951.88 --> 3952.26]  if you're reading
[3952.26 --> 3952.82]  a different one
[3952.82 --> 3953.68]  than what we have here,
[3954.04 --> 3955.08]  might say the man
[3955.08 --> 3955.44]  of lawlessness
[3955.44 --> 3956.30]  there.
[3957.58 --> 3958.52]  Bible scholars
[3958.52 --> 3959.30]  will tell you
[3959.30 --> 3960.86]  that this is
[3960.86 --> 3961.58]  probably
[3961.58 --> 3962.78]  the only
[3962.78 --> 3964.10]  explicit reference
[3964.10 --> 3965.88]  in Paul's writing
[3965.88 --> 3966.70]  to
[3966.70 --> 3968.38]  what you might know
[3968.38 --> 3969.04]  by the name
[3969.04 --> 3970.08]  Antichrist.
[3971.56 --> 3972.20]  Antichrist
[3972.20 --> 3972.92]  is a figure
[3972.92 --> 3974.40]  that's talked about
[3974.40 --> 3976.02]  more in John's writing,
[3976.10 --> 3977.00]  the Apostles John,
[3977.38 --> 3978.56]  both as a type,
[3978.74 --> 3979.62]  and so in the three
[3979.62 --> 3980.78]  letters of John,
[3981.14 --> 3981.98]  we hear about
[3981.98 --> 3983.26]  Antichrists,
[3983.80 --> 3984.88]  and Antichrists
[3984.88 --> 3985.92]  are anyone
[3985.92 --> 3987.32]  who actively,
[3987.90 --> 3989.14]  usually forcibly,
[3989.52 --> 3990.72]  oppose the teaching
[3990.72 --> 3991.82]  and the transformation
[3991.82 --> 3993.60]  and the exalting
[3993.60 --> 3994.54]  of Jesus.
[3995.94 --> 3997.02]  And as a sort of
[3997.02 --> 3998.34]  archetype,
[3998.64 --> 3999.54]  as a sort of
[3999.54 --> 4000.92]  ultimate revealing
[4000.92 --> 4001.60]  of that,
[4001.70 --> 4002.04]  there is
[4002.04 --> 4003.70]  an ultimate
[4003.70 --> 4004.88]  Antichrist,
[4005.74 --> 4006.42]  an individual
[4006.42 --> 4008.06]  who is this
[4008.06 --> 4008.90]  man of
[4008.90 --> 4009.80]  lawlessness.
[4010.08 --> 4011.32]  The book of Revelation
[4011.32 --> 4012.58]  paints a picture
[4012.58 --> 4013.68]  of an Antichrist
[4013.68 --> 4014.62]  into which
[4014.62 --> 4015.36]  all of these
[4015.36 --> 4016.36]  other ideas
[4016.36 --> 4017.58]  are poured
[4017.58 --> 4018.88]  into one person.
[4018.88 --> 4021.88]  And that's why,
[4022.00 --> 4023.28]  Paul is saying,
[4023.72 --> 4024.78]  knowing the truth,
[4025.18 --> 4025.98]  why knowing
[4025.98 --> 4027.30]  this is true
[4027.30 --> 4028.22]  matters.
[4029.26 --> 4030.68]  Because the singular
[4030.68 --> 4031.70]  responsibility
[4031.70 --> 4033.04]  and task of Satan,
[4033.30 --> 4033.82]  if we were to
[4033.82 --> 4034.62]  boil it all down,
[4034.84 --> 4035.94]  is to deceive,
[4037.86 --> 4038.52]  is to trick,
[4039.02 --> 4039.76]  to lie.
[4040.56 --> 4041.88]  And he wants you
[4041.88 --> 4042.82]  to fall
[4042.82 --> 4043.84]  away
[4043.84 --> 4045.06]  by this
[4045.06 --> 4046.24]  counterfeit.
[4046.24 --> 4048.06]  Now notice
[4048.06 --> 4049.48]  in chapter 1,
[4050.00 --> 4050.92]  verse 7,
[4051.52 --> 4052.42]  we read,
[4052.78 --> 4053.76]  this will happen
[4053.76 --> 4054.70]  when the Lord
[4054.70 --> 4056.08]  Jesus is revealed.
[4057.34 --> 4057.56]  Right?
[4057.70 --> 4058.20]  Revealed
[4058.20 --> 4059.12]  is the word
[4059.12 --> 4059.72]  apocalypse.
[4060.06 --> 4060.40]  Josh,
[4060.54 --> 4061.12]  last week,
[4061.42 --> 4062.40]  talked about that
[4062.40 --> 4063.14]  for us
[4063.14 --> 4063.66]  and we dove
[4063.66 --> 4064.50]  deep into that.
[4064.62 --> 4065.08]  Apocalypse
[4065.08 --> 4066.68]  means revelation.
[4067.64 --> 4067.96]  Jesus
[4067.96 --> 4069.20]  is the apocalypse
[4069.20 --> 4070.32]  of God.
[4070.42 --> 4071.30]  He is the true
[4071.30 --> 4072.00]  and full
[4072.00 --> 4072.80]  revelation.
[4073.16 --> 4074.04]  We know him
[4074.04 --> 4075.42]  through the revelation
[4075.42 --> 4076.68]  of the word
[4076.68 --> 4078.30]  eternally made
[4078.30 --> 4079.20]  known to us
[4079.20 --> 4080.64]  through the apostolic
[4080.64 --> 4081.30]  word.
[4082.60 --> 4083.02]  And now,
[4083.16 --> 4083.64]  notice,
[4083.88 --> 4084.86]  in our text,
[4085.66 --> 4086.50]  in verse 3,
[4087.06 --> 4088.32]  the man of lawlessness
[4088.32 --> 4089.46]  will also
[4089.46 --> 4090.60]  be revealed.
[4091.74 --> 4093.04]  And then in verse 6,
[4093.14 --> 4093.46]  we read,
[4093.74 --> 4094.56]  so that he may be
[4094.56 --> 4095.70]  revealed at the
[4095.70 --> 4096.42]  proper time.
[4096.70 --> 4097.10]  And again,
[4097.18 --> 4097.72]  in verse 8,
[4097.92 --> 4098.84]  the lawless one
[4098.84 --> 4100.08]  will be revealed.
[4100.30 --> 4101.24]  There's that word again.
[4102.40 --> 4102.54]  Right?
[4102.54 --> 4103.76]  The antichrist
[4103.76 --> 4105.98]  is an antirevelation.
[4105.98 --> 4107.66]  It's a counterfeit
[4107.66 --> 4110.10]  designed to deceive
[4110.10 --> 4111.78]  and steal away
[4111.78 --> 4112.80]  those who believe.
[4114.20 --> 4115.08]  Verse 9 and 10
[4115.08 --> 4115.62]  say that
[4115.62 --> 4116.30]  he,
[4116.62 --> 4117.58]  the man of lawlessness,
[4117.88 --> 4120.22]  this antirevelation,
[4120.66 --> 4122.14]  will use all sorts
[4122.14 --> 4122.80]  of displays
[4122.80 --> 4123.66]  of power
[4123.66 --> 4124.84]  through signs
[4124.84 --> 4125.56]  and wonders
[4125.56 --> 4126.82]  that serve the lie
[4126.82 --> 4128.10]  and all the ways
[4128.10 --> 4128.96]  that wickedness
[4128.96 --> 4130.12]  deceives those
[4130.12 --> 4132.10]  who are perishing.
[4138.28 --> 4139.04]  Maybe,
[4139.30 --> 4141.30]  maybe,
[4141.46 --> 4142.46]  one of the ways
[4142.46 --> 4144.08]  that wickedness
[4144.08 --> 4145.12]  deceives those
[4145.12 --> 4146.16]  who are perishing
[4146.16 --> 4149.18]  is by giving you
[4149.18 --> 4150.42]  everything you thought
[4150.42 --> 4150.90]  you wanted.
[4154.50 --> 4155.26]  Maybe,
[4155.68 --> 4157.24]  one of the ways
[4157.24 --> 4158.06]  that wickedness
[4158.06 --> 4158.80]  deceives
[4158.80 --> 4160.32]  is by surrounding
[4160.32 --> 4161.94]  you with a culture
[4161.94 --> 4162.78]  that says,
[4163.02 --> 4163.70]  this is normal.
[4164.68 --> 4165.88]  This is no big deal.
[4166.78 --> 4167.92]  Stop caring so much
[4167.92 --> 4168.58]  about those silly
[4168.58 --> 4169.36]  little things.
[4170.48 --> 4170.58]  Right?
[4170.62 --> 4171.64]  Get on the right side.
[4173.72 --> 4174.28]  Or,
[4174.46 --> 4174.78]  maybe,
[4175.14 --> 4176.38]  wickedness deceives
[4176.38 --> 4177.66]  by making you think
[4177.66 --> 4178.48]  that wicked
[4178.48 --> 4180.22]  doesn't actually exist.
[4181.34 --> 4182.68]  That moral
[4182.68 --> 4183.88]  and morality
[4183.88 --> 4185.18]  isn't real
[4185.18 --> 4186.34]  but a social construct.
[4186.34 --> 4186.46]  corrupt.
[4187.54 --> 4188.10]  Or,
[4188.26 --> 4189.62]  even more perniciously,
[4189.70 --> 4190.08]  I think,
[4190.16 --> 4191.28]  for us here
[4191.28 --> 4191.86]  this morning,
[4192.36 --> 4192.92]  maybe,
[4192.92 --> 4195.00]  wickedness deceives
[4195.00 --> 4196.26]  by saying
[4196.26 --> 4197.08]  that moral
[4197.08 --> 4198.38]  is all there is.
[4199.90 --> 4201.02]  That morality
[4201.02 --> 4202.06]  is all that matters.
[4202.48 --> 4202.76]  Good,
[4203.02 --> 4203.34]  bad,
[4203.48 --> 4204.18]  you judge
[4204.18 --> 4205.02]  that fiercely.
[4206.14 --> 4207.20]  Cancel quickly
[4207.20 --> 4208.40]  and write them off
[4208.40 --> 4208.96]  absolutely.
[4208.96 --> 4212.12]  Maybe that's
[4212.12 --> 4212.84]  the pernicious
[4212.84 --> 4214.04]  effect of wickedness.
[4215.74 --> 4216.64]  Paul writes,
[4216.74 --> 4217.26]  they perish
[4217.26 --> 4218.22]  because they refuse
[4218.22 --> 4219.66]  to love the truth
[4219.66 --> 4221.10]  and so be saved.
[4222.24 --> 4223.24]  And so for us,
[4223.36 --> 4224.56]  that means only one thing.
[4225.36 --> 4226.32]  Love the truth.
[4227.66 --> 4228.66]  Love the revelation
[4228.66 --> 4229.34]  of God
[4229.34 --> 4230.38]  who is Jesus.
[4230.58 --> 4231.30]  Love Jesus
[4231.30 --> 4232.58]  with all your heart
[4232.58 --> 4233.38]  and soul
[4233.38 --> 4233.96]  and mind
[4233.96 --> 4234.56]  and strength.
[4234.90 --> 4235.88]  Love His word
[4235.88 --> 4236.92]  and then
[4236.92 --> 4238.10]  in so loving
[4238.10 --> 4239.46]  and in so receiving
[4239.46 --> 4240.16]  and being,
[4240.52 --> 4242.12]  you will not be deceived.
[4243.90 --> 4244.10]  Right?
[4244.14 --> 4244.78]  That's the point
[4244.78 --> 4245.74]  of all of this.
[4246.60 --> 4246.82]  Right?
[4246.86 --> 4247.72]  When you ask
[4247.72 --> 4248.92]  what is true,
[4249.16 --> 4250.06]  when you wrestle with
[4250.06 --> 4251.10]  is this true,
[4251.48 --> 4252.96]  God stands in front of you
[4252.96 --> 4253.40]  and He says,
[4253.58 --> 4254.00]  yes!
[4254.48 --> 4255.96]  I am the way,
[4256.26 --> 4256.84]  the truth,
[4256.92 --> 4257.86]  and the life.
[4259.26 --> 4260.56]  When you are wondering
[4260.56 --> 4262.08]  is this really true,
[4262.48 --> 4263.50]  go to the one
[4263.50 --> 4265.04]  who defines reality.
[4265.04 --> 4267.28]  Right?
[4267.32 --> 4268.64]  That's the only way
[4268.64 --> 4269.38]  to know
[4269.38 --> 4270.80]  what is really true.
[4272.12 --> 4272.98]  And when you are anxious
[4272.98 --> 4274.06]  and when you are worried
[4274.06 --> 4274.98]  about what is next
[4274.98 --> 4276.08]  or what is coming,
[4276.46 --> 4277.28]  go to the one
[4277.28 --> 4278.46]  who directs history.
[4279.92 --> 4280.48]  Right?
[4280.50 --> 4281.14]  That's the point
[4281.14 --> 4281.88]  of this text.
[4282.46 --> 4282.68]  Right?
[4282.70 --> 4283.98]  That's the big idea here.
[4284.22 --> 4284.32]  Right?
[4284.34 --> 4285.16]  That God,
[4285.40 --> 4286.82]  in His grace,
[4287.30 --> 4288.28]  tells believers
[4288.28 --> 4289.74]  what to expect
[4289.74 --> 4291.02]  so that you won't
[4291.02 --> 4291.62]  be deceived
[4291.62 --> 4293.00]  and so that you
[4293.00 --> 4293.66]  can live
[4293.66 --> 4294.34]  with eyes
[4294.34 --> 4295.00]  wide,
[4295.30 --> 4295.74]  open.
[4297.74 --> 4297.96]  Right?
[4298.02 --> 4298.32]  God,
[4298.48 --> 4299.48]  in His grace,
[4299.90 --> 4301.08]  is telling you
[4301.08 --> 4301.86]  the truth
[4301.86 --> 4304.02]  so that you can see
[4304.02 --> 4304.62]  clearly
[4304.62 --> 4306.28]  what is true.
[4308.68 --> 4309.26]  Now,
[4309.28 --> 4309.94]  notice this
[4309.94 --> 4311.32]  carefully.
[4313.70 --> 4315.00]  This warning,
[4316.18 --> 4316.48]  right,
[4316.54 --> 4317.40]  this truth,
[4317.76 --> 4319.12]  can't be
[4319.12 --> 4320.00]  for those
[4320.00 --> 4321.06]  who are perishing.
[4321.06 --> 4322.68]  right?
[4322.68 --> 4323.72]  To use Paul's language.
[4324.66 --> 4325.32]  This warning
[4325.32 --> 4326.62]  is for those
[4326.62 --> 4327.46]  who believe
[4327.46 --> 4328.66]  so that we will
[4328.66 --> 4329.42]  not perish.
[4330.14 --> 4330.22]  Right?
[4330.28 --> 4330.94]  This warning
[4330.94 --> 4332.32]  is a means
[4332.32 --> 4333.40]  of perseverance.
[4334.06 --> 4334.68]  It's a means
[4334.68 --> 4335.68]  of keeping you
[4335.68 --> 4336.28]  connected
[4336.28 --> 4337.48]  to the truth.
[4337.78 --> 4338.36]  The warning
[4338.36 --> 4338.94]  itself
[4338.94 --> 4339.96]  is a grace
[4339.96 --> 4340.94]  of God
[4340.94 --> 4341.54]  and God,
[4341.66 --> 4342.26]  in His grace,
[4342.34 --> 4343.38]  is saying to you
[4343.38 --> 4344.24]  and He's saying
[4344.24 --> 4344.70]  to me,
[4345.00 --> 4346.04]  open your eyes,
[4346.82 --> 4347.94]  open your mind,
[4347.94 --> 4349.14]  open your heart
[4349.14 --> 4350.12]  and know
[4350.12 --> 4351.08]  that I
[4351.08 --> 4352.52]  am God.
[4352.64 --> 4353.56]  There is no other
[4353.56 --> 4354.82]  like me.
[4356.40 --> 4357.30]  And here's the thing,
[4357.58 --> 4357.74]  right?
[4358.84 --> 4359.48]  Sometimes,
[4359.74 --> 4360.84]  sometimes,
[4361.02 --> 4362.06]  we believe
[4362.06 --> 4362.96]  or we're guilty
[4362.96 --> 4363.60]  of thinking
[4363.60 --> 4364.80]  that in order
[4364.80 --> 4365.58]  to believe,
[4366.26 --> 4366.88]  I have to shut
[4366.88 --> 4367.60]  my brain off.
[4368.88 --> 4369.62]  That faith
[4369.62 --> 4370.90]  is how the opposite
[4370.90 --> 4371.72]  of truth
[4371.72 --> 4372.62]  or the opposite
[4372.62 --> 4373.56]  of what can be
[4373.56 --> 4374.40]  rationally
[4374.40 --> 4375.22]  understood
[4375.22 --> 4376.28]  and discerned.
[4376.34 --> 4377.04]  And absolutely,
[4377.22 --> 4377.98]  there is a mystery
[4377.98 --> 4379.10]  beyond comprehension
[4379.10 --> 4380.16]  in relationship
[4380.16 --> 4380.70]  to God.
[4381.86 --> 4382.16]  Right?
[4382.42 --> 4383.32]  But the impact
[4383.32 --> 4384.26]  of that way
[4384.26 --> 4384.74]  of thinking
[4384.74 --> 4385.18]  sometimes
[4385.18 --> 4386.28]  is when we
[4386.28 --> 4386.92]  struggle with
[4386.92 --> 4387.92]  questions like,
[4388.02 --> 4388.78]  is it true?
[4388.86 --> 4390.02]  Is any of this true?
[4390.40 --> 4391.22]  We kind of tell
[4391.22 --> 4391.98]  ourselves we've got
[4391.98 --> 4392.68]  to shut our brain
[4392.68 --> 4393.30]  down and just
[4393.30 --> 4394.00]  believe harder.
[4397.38 --> 4398.30]  But hear me say
[4398.30 --> 4399.02]  this very clearly.
[4400.28 --> 4400.88]  Christianity,
[4401.74 --> 4402.60]  the gospel,
[4402.82 --> 4403.34]  God's word,
[4403.92 --> 4404.52]  God Himself,
[4404.52 --> 4406.36]  is not afraid
[4406.36 --> 4407.40]  of your questions.
[4410.40 --> 4410.52]  Right?
[4410.60 --> 4411.60]  Use your doubts
[4411.60 --> 4412.56]  to go deeper
[4412.56 --> 4413.66]  into faith.
[4414.46 --> 4415.24]  God can handle
[4415.24 --> 4415.80]  your fear.
[4416.84 --> 4417.84]  Jesus Himself
[4417.84 --> 4419.48]  prays in John 17,
[4419.92 --> 4420.90]  sanctify them
[4420.90 --> 4421.94]  by your truth.
[4422.34 --> 4423.14]  Your word
[4423.14 --> 4424.44]  is truth.
[4426.56 --> 4426.90]  And so,
[4427.02 --> 4427.64]  hear Jesus
[4427.64 --> 4428.70]  standing in front
[4428.70 --> 4429.58]  of you this morning,
[4429.92 --> 4430.80]  right now,
[4431.02 --> 4431.84]  saying to
[4431.84 --> 4432.88]  those of you,
[4433.02 --> 4433.94]  to anyone
[4433.94 --> 4435.40]  who has ever said,
[4435.72 --> 4436.26]  what if this
[4436.26 --> 4436.88]  Jesus thing
[4436.88 --> 4437.56]  isn't true?
[4438.38 --> 4439.78]  Jesus is saying,
[4439.98 --> 4441.04]  I am the way.
[4441.80 --> 4444.08]  I am truth.
[4444.94 --> 4446.10]  Come to me
[4446.10 --> 4447.78]  with all your anxieties,
[4447.78 --> 4448.96]  with all your worries.
[4449.10 --> 4449.66]  Come to me
[4449.66 --> 4450.44]  with your tears
[4450.44 --> 4451.42]  and your fears
[4451.42 --> 4452.38]  and your loneliness.
[4452.62 --> 4453.12]  Come to me
[4453.12 --> 4454.06]  with your heartache
[4454.06 --> 4454.98]  and your hurt.
[4454.98 --> 4457.00]  And I will give you
[4457.00 --> 4458.20]  rest.
[4460.20 --> 4462.74]  To all of your questions,
[4463.94 --> 4465.86]  Jesus is the answer.
[4466.66 --> 4468.86]  To all of your doubts,
[4469.38 --> 4471.18]  Jesus is the truth.
[4472.14 --> 4473.92]  And to all of your wondering,
[4474.88 --> 4476.52]  Jesus has the words
[4476.52 --> 4478.50]  of eternal life.
[4479.00 --> 4481.36]  Come to Him.
[4481.36 --> 4483.92]  even
[4483.92 --> 4485.48]  to the questions
[4485.48 --> 4486.32]  about the end
[4486.32 --> 4487.36]  of all of this.
[4488.42 --> 4489.40]  Even questions
[4489.40 --> 4490.30]  about what the end
[4490.30 --> 4491.22]  will be like
[4491.22 --> 4492.82]  at and in
[4492.82 --> 4493.54]  and through
[4493.54 --> 4494.40]  and after
[4494.40 --> 4495.94]  the return of Jesus.
[4496.46 --> 4497.44]  God tells us
[4497.44 --> 4498.56]  what to expect
[4498.56 --> 4500.06]  and what to
[4500.06 --> 4501.98]  project
[4501.98 --> 4502.90]  and protect
[4502.90 --> 4503.98]  so that
[4503.98 --> 4505.24]  you aren't
[4505.24 --> 4505.90]  deceived.
[4506.80 --> 4507.54]  So that you
[4507.54 --> 4508.12]  aren't tricked
[4508.12 --> 4508.90]  into following
[4508.90 --> 4509.88]  some counterfeit
[4509.88 --> 4510.74]  Christ,
[4511.26 --> 4511.88]  deceived
[4511.88 --> 4512.80]  by the promises
[4512.80 --> 4513.56]  of a false
[4513.56 --> 4514.36]  kingdom.
[4515.80 --> 4516.88]  And until that day,
[4517.32 --> 4518.34]  until that end,
[4518.50 --> 4519.74]  Paul provides
[4519.74 --> 4520.22]  for us
[4520.22 --> 4521.14]  another comfort
[4521.14 --> 4522.52]  and we'll start
[4522.52 --> 4523.52]  wrapping up here.
[4524.64 --> 4525.94]  In verse 5
[4525.94 --> 4526.64]  through 8,
[4527.32 --> 4528.32]  he effectively
[4528.32 --> 4529.42]  tells them,
[4529.84 --> 4530.94]  I've already
[4530.94 --> 4531.74]  told you this.
[4532.58 --> 4533.76]  You should know this.
[4534.52 --> 4535.44]  And then he adds,
[4535.84 --> 4537.02]  and now you know
[4537.02 --> 4538.42]  what is holding him back.
[4538.42 --> 4539.88]  Somehow,
[4540.48 --> 4541.44]  in some way,
[4541.62 --> 4542.70]  the man of lawlessness
[4542.70 --> 4544.16]  and the rebellion
[4544.16 --> 4545.90]  is being restrained
[4545.90 --> 4546.66]  right now.
[4547.56 --> 4548.14]  Paul says,
[4548.52 --> 4550.26]  the one who holds it back
[4550.26 --> 4551.84]  will continue to do so
[4551.84 --> 4552.52]  until he
[4552.52 --> 4553.76]  is taken away.
[4555.24 --> 4556.36]  Paul tells them,
[4556.60 --> 4557.38]  you know what
[4557.38 --> 4558.68]  and you know who.
[4560.62 --> 4560.88]  Now,
[4561.42 --> 4563.46]  the problem is
[4563.46 --> 4565.24]  that they might know that,
[4565.86 --> 4566.78]  but we don't.
[4566.78 --> 4569.24]  scholars suggest
[4569.24 --> 4570.40]  that Paul
[4570.40 --> 4571.22]  is referring
[4571.22 --> 4572.24]  to something
[4572.24 --> 4573.24]  that he told them
[4573.24 --> 4574.10]  while he was with them.
[4574.96 --> 4575.78]  To a teaching
[4575.78 --> 4576.62]  that he gave them
[4576.62 --> 4577.62]  that isn't written down
[4577.62 --> 4578.54]  for us.
[4578.70 --> 4579.04]  And so,
[4579.34 --> 4580.50]  we have to figure it out.
[4580.58 --> 4581.24]  We have to discern.
[4581.98 --> 4582.78]  And I want to be candid
[4582.78 --> 4583.10]  with you,
[4583.18 --> 4584.22]  there is a huge debate
[4584.22 --> 4585.64]  throughout church history
[4585.64 --> 4586.50]  and in scholarship
[4586.50 --> 4588.18]  and in contemporary preaching
[4588.18 --> 4589.38]  about just exactly
[4589.38 --> 4590.52]  what is going on here.
[4590.96 --> 4591.32]  And so,
[4591.38 --> 4592.34]  I'm going to give to you
[4592.34 --> 4592.86]  what I think
[4592.86 --> 4593.66]  is the best
[4593.66 --> 4595.22]  approximation of it,
[4595.22 --> 4595.80]  but I would love
[4595.80 --> 4596.62]  to hear your ideas
[4596.62 --> 4597.86]  and I'm sure
[4597.86 --> 4599.06]  that when we record
[4599.06 --> 4600.30]  a podcast later this week,
[4600.60 --> 4601.60]  it will be very interesting
[4601.60 --> 4602.56]  as we bounce it around.
[4605.58 --> 4606.10]  But,
[4606.44 --> 4609.68]  as we have the question
[4609.68 --> 4611.56]  of who is
[4611.56 --> 4613.02]  the true thing
[4613.02 --> 4614.36]  or the true one
[4614.36 --> 4616.22]  that is holding back
[4616.22 --> 4617.66]  the power of lawlessness
[4617.66 --> 4619.22]  already at work,
[4619.30 --> 4620.18]  we ask ourselves,
[4620.18 --> 4621.94]  which or what
[4621.94 --> 4623.62]  is this person
[4623.62 --> 4625.16]  that is now
[4625.16 --> 4625.90]  currently
[4625.90 --> 4628.22]  holding that back?
[4629.44 --> 4630.04]  And again,
[4630.10 --> 4630.52]  I think that
[4630.52 --> 4631.74]  the best answer
[4631.74 --> 4633.46]  is an approximation
[4633.46 --> 4634.70]  from three different
[4634.70 --> 4636.24]  places in Scripture.
[4636.44 --> 4636.62]  And so,
[4636.72 --> 4637.50]  let me tie those
[4637.50 --> 4638.58]  all together for you.
[4639.36 --> 4639.90]  First,
[4640.48 --> 4641.70]  in Matthew 16,
[4642.26 --> 4643.22]  Jesus says
[4643.22 --> 4644.20]  to Peter,
[4644.40 --> 4645.48]  I tell you
[4645.48 --> 4646.76]  that you are Peter
[4646.76 --> 4648.42]  and on this rock
[4648.42 --> 4649.58]  I will build
[4649.58 --> 4650.32]  my church
[4650.32 --> 4651.38]  and the gates
[4651.38 --> 4652.20]  of Hades
[4652.20 --> 4653.86]  will not overcome it.
[4655.86 --> 4657.52]  The power of Hades,
[4657.76 --> 4658.56]  the gates of Hades,
[4658.68 --> 4659.64]  the work of Satan
[4659.64 --> 4661.48]  will not overcome
[4661.48 --> 4662.72]  the church.
[4664.58 --> 4665.60]  The church.
[4666.80 --> 4667.40]  Second,
[4667.74 --> 4669.26]  in Mark 13,
[4669.40 --> 4669.84]  10,
[4670.60 --> 4671.62]  when Jesus
[4671.62 --> 4672.66]  is discussing
[4672.66 --> 4674.42]  when the end
[4674.42 --> 4675.18]  will come,
[4675.50 --> 4676.18]  he says
[4676.18 --> 4677.38]  to his disciples
[4677.38 --> 4679.00]  that the gospel
[4679.00 --> 4680.70]  must first be preached
[4680.70 --> 4681.98]  to all nations.
[4684.22 --> 4684.48]  So,
[4684.56 --> 4685.24]  right now,
[4685.62 --> 4686.50]  the gospel
[4686.50 --> 4688.38]  is being preached
[4688.38 --> 4690.44]  and it's holding back
[4690.44 --> 4691.58]  the deceiver
[4691.58 --> 4692.98]  because it hasn't yet
[4692.98 --> 4694.44]  reached all nations.
[4694.58 --> 4695.82]  The truth of Jesus
[4695.82 --> 4696.94]  being proclaimed
[4696.94 --> 4698.44]  in the world
[4698.44 --> 4701.18]  and part of its effect
[4701.18 --> 4703.54]  is restraining evil,
[4703.76 --> 4704.44]  holding back
[4704.44 --> 4705.10]  the power
[4705.10 --> 4706.28]  of lawlessness
[4706.28 --> 4707.42]  because the gospel
[4707.42 --> 4709.14]  reveals truth.
[4710.92 --> 4711.46]  And then third,
[4712.40 --> 4714.44]  in Revelation 20,
[4714.64 --> 4715.90]  verse 1 and 3,
[4716.64 --> 4717.58]  we read,
[4718.60 --> 4719.68]  I saw an angel
[4719.68 --> 4720.44]  coming down
[4720.44 --> 4721.08]  out of heaven
[4721.08 --> 4722.06]  having the keys
[4722.06 --> 4723.18]  to the abyss
[4723.18 --> 4724.62]  and holding in his hand
[4724.62 --> 4725.64]  a great chain.
[4726.04 --> 4727.70]  He seized the dragon,
[4727.90 --> 4728.96]  that ancient serpent
[4728.96 --> 4730.06]  who is the devil
[4730.06 --> 4730.94]  or Satan,
[4730.94 --> 4732.06]  and bound him
[4732.06 --> 4733.20]  for a thousand years
[4733.20 --> 4734.14]  and threw him
[4734.14 --> 4735.24]  into the abyss
[4735.24 --> 4735.92]  and locked
[4735.92 --> 4737.40]  and sealed it over him
[4737.40 --> 4738.32]  to keep him
[4738.32 --> 4739.22]  from deceiving
[4739.22 --> 4740.58]  the nations anymore
[4740.58 --> 4742.16]  until the thousand years
[4742.16 --> 4742.64]  were ended.
[4743.32 --> 4744.02]  After that,
[4744.10 --> 4745.26]  he must be set free
[4745.26 --> 4746.52]  for a short time.
[4748.90 --> 4749.22]  And so,
[4749.92 --> 4751.26]  maybe the angel
[4751.26 --> 4752.86]  of Revelation 20
[4752.86 --> 4753.78]  is the one
[4753.78 --> 4754.74]  holding back
[4754.74 --> 4756.12]  along with the church
[4756.12 --> 4757.28]  and the gospel.
[4757.82 --> 4758.08]  And now,
[4758.16 --> 4759.32]  I can also add
[4759.32 --> 4760.20]  that some people
[4760.20 --> 4760.90]  understand
[4760.90 --> 4762.50]  the angel here
[4762.50 --> 4764.90]  to be a literary device
[4764.90 --> 4766.48]  consistent in the long line
[4766.48 --> 4767.54]  of literary devices
[4767.54 --> 4768.76]  in the book of Revelation
[4768.76 --> 4769.88]  as a reference
[4769.88 --> 4772.56]  to the active providence
[4772.56 --> 4773.26]  of God.
[4774.44 --> 4775.52]  Point is,
[4776.24 --> 4777.22]  God himself,
[4777.84 --> 4779.20]  either through his active
[4779.20 --> 4780.42]  providential will
[4780.42 --> 4782.00]  or through his armies
[4782.00 --> 4782.68]  of angels,
[4783.16 --> 4784.32]  has the dragon
[4784.32 --> 4785.20]  restrained.
[4785.20 --> 4787.36]  And so,
[4787.44 --> 4788.18]  there's three things
[4788.18 --> 4789.40]  there that we pull together.
[4790.06 --> 4790.52]  The church,
[4791.08 --> 4792.40]  the preaching of the gospel,
[4792.86 --> 4793.56]  and the power
[4793.56 --> 4795.12]  and protection of God
[4795.12 --> 4796.78]  by his providence
[4796.78 --> 4797.74]  is how,
[4797.90 --> 4798.86]  right now,
[4799.00 --> 4800.38]  evil is restrained
[4800.38 --> 4801.02]  and how,
[4801.18 --> 4801.74]  right now,
[4801.92 --> 4803.20]  Satan is bound.
[4804.70 --> 4805.32]  And so,
[4805.68 --> 4806.00]  church,
[4806.54 --> 4808.54]  this is your mission.
[4809.88 --> 4811.16]  This is your purpose.
[4811.30 --> 4812.52]  This is what you get to do.
[4812.52 --> 4813.28]  Right?
[4813.34 --> 4814.20]  To be the church
[4814.20 --> 4815.46]  is to preach the gospel
[4815.46 --> 4817.48]  in a way that transforms lives
[4817.48 --> 4818.98]  and transforms the world.
[4820.16 --> 4820.40]  Right?
[4820.46 --> 4821.40]  Your message
[4821.40 --> 4822.48]  literally
[4822.48 --> 4823.62]  binds
[4823.62 --> 4824.38]  evil.
[4826.02 --> 4827.28]  Do you hear that?
[4828.56 --> 4830.44]  And as you go
[4830.44 --> 4831.18]  to declare
[4831.18 --> 4832.62]  this message
[4832.62 --> 4833.80]  into the world,
[4834.12 --> 4835.34]  know that you go
[4835.34 --> 4836.10]  in
[4836.10 --> 4836.90]  and with
[4836.90 --> 4837.92]  and full of
[4837.92 --> 4838.64]  the power
[4838.64 --> 4839.78]  and protection
[4839.78 --> 4840.58]  of God.
[4840.58 --> 4840.62]  God,
[4841.14 --> 4843.24]  this is what
[4843.24 --> 4844.68]  you now do
[4844.68 --> 4845.90]  because this is now
[4845.90 --> 4847.04]  what God is doing
[4847.04 --> 4848.44]  through you.
[4849.76 --> 4850.30]  Nothing
[4850.30 --> 4851.36]  surprises
[4851.36 --> 4852.48]  God
[4852.48 --> 4853.06]  and you
[4853.06 --> 4853.88]  are held
[4853.88 --> 4854.68]  in his
[4854.68 --> 4855.38]  will.
[4855.54 --> 4856.44]  That's what providence
[4856.44 --> 4856.84]  means.
[4858.16 --> 4859.50]  That's your confidence.
[4861.00 --> 4861.12]  Right?
[4861.20 --> 4862.00]  This is your
[4862.00 --> 4862.74]  truth
[4862.74 --> 4863.36]  and it's nothing
[4863.36 --> 4864.18]  short of the truth
[4864.18 --> 4865.18]  of the whole world.
[4866.46 --> 4867.40]  How do we know
[4867.40 --> 4868.30]  that this is true?
[4869.26 --> 4869.74]  Well,
[4869.76 --> 4870.40]  Jesus is true.
[4870.92 --> 4871.66]  We trust him.
[4872.60 --> 4873.28]  How do we know
[4873.28 --> 4873.92]  that this is true?
[4874.22 --> 4874.38]  Well,
[4874.44 --> 4875.28]  God has told us
[4875.28 --> 4875.96]  it's true
[4875.96 --> 4877.56]  and we rely on that.
[4878.24 --> 4879.00]  And how do we know
[4879.00 --> 4879.60]  that this is true?
[4879.86 --> 4880.06]  Well,
[4880.12 --> 4880.86]  we live
[4880.86 --> 4881.82]  in this
[4881.82 --> 4882.54]  truth.
[4883.26 --> 4884.22]  Our lives
[4884.22 --> 4885.28]  are transformed
[4885.28 --> 4886.42]  by it.
[4887.88 --> 4889.10]  Open your eyes
[4889.10 --> 4889.90]  wide
[4889.90 --> 4890.98]  and do not
[4890.98 --> 4891.70]  be deceived
[4891.70 --> 4893.22]  but go.
[4893.94 --> 4894.30]  Go.
[4894.86 --> 4895.34]  Knowing
[4895.34 --> 4896.82]  what to expect
[4896.82 --> 4897.84]  and knowing
[4897.84 --> 4898.66]  that you
[4898.66 --> 4899.38]  go with
[4899.38 --> 4899.94]  God.
[4900.40 --> 4900.94]  Come what
[4900.94 --> 4901.30]  may,
[4902.08 --> 4902.32]  you
[4902.32 --> 4903.36]  go with
[4903.36 --> 4903.76]  God.
[4904.22 --> 4904.46]  Amen?
[4905.46 --> 4905.86]  Amen.
[4906.10 --> 4906.80]  Let's pray together.
[4913.48 --> 4913.90]  God,
[4913.98 --> 4914.74]  we do not know
[4914.74 --> 4915.30]  the day
[4915.30 --> 4916.58]  or the hour
[4916.58 --> 4917.78]  of your return.
[4918.70 --> 4919.56]  Only you do.
[4919.56 --> 4920.06]  God,
[4920.06 --> 4920.90]  we do not know
[4920.90 --> 4921.70]  that this is true.
[4921.70 --> 4922.62]  But you have told us
[4922.62 --> 4923.76]  what to watch out for.
[4924.76 --> 4925.86]  And you have told us
[4925.86 --> 4926.06]  what,
[4926.32 --> 4928.12]  before that happens,
[4928.22 --> 4929.60]  will have to happen.
[4929.60 --> 4931.70]  And so,
[4931.94 --> 4932.32]  now,
[4932.56 --> 4932.86]  God,
[4933.46 --> 4934.34]  we stand

[4935.00 --> 4935.52]  sure
[4935.52 --> 4936.44]  truth.
[4937.50 --> 4938.58]  We stand
[4938.58 --> 4939.22]  in this
[4939.22 --> 4939.74]  sure
[4939.74 --> 4940.72]  reality.
[4941.40 --> 4942.06]  We stand
[4942.06 --> 4943.02]  in the confidence
[4943.02 --> 4944.64]  of the gospel,
[4945.02 --> 4945.62]  the confidence
[4945.62 --> 4946.72]  of the truth
[4946.72 --> 4948.00]  that your church
[4948.00 --> 4948.86]  will never
[4948.86 --> 4950.18]  be overcome
[4950.18 --> 4951.46]  and that you
[4951.46 --> 4952.46]  are working
[4952.46 --> 4953.72]  in the world
[4953.72 --> 4954.46]  right now,
[4954.74 --> 4955.44]  right here,
[4955.82 --> 4956.52]  through us.
[4956.52 --> 4958.68]  And so,
[4958.80 --> 4959.20]  embolden
[4959.20 --> 4960.32]  our hearts,
[4960.82 --> 4961.20]  strengthen
[4961.20 --> 4962.58]  our faith,
[4962.74 --> 4963.50]  and send us
[4963.50 --> 4964.60]  out with this
[4964.60 --> 4965.46]  message of hope
[4965.46 --> 4966.50]  and love
[4966.50 --> 4967.32]  that by it
[4967.32 --> 4968.70]  the whole world
[4968.70 --> 4969.36]  may know
[4969.36 --> 4970.46]  that you
[4970.46 --> 4972.16]  are God.
[4973.00 --> 4973.96]  To the glory
[4973.96 --> 4974.88]  of your name,
[4975.04 --> 4975.54]  we pray,
[4975.88 --> 4976.58]  in the power
[4976.58 --> 4977.26]  of Jesus'
