[0.00 --> 3.14]  ...and I learned the same with people, really, but I'm eating it.
[3.40 --> 8.16]  I'm thinking, well, in I don't know if you can have been a little other for people to do that, but Jesus.
[8.58 --> 9.26]  That's right.
[9.52 --> 9.70]  Yeah.
[10.52 --> 11.86]  It's like three to three.
[11.86 --> 12.18]  ...
[12.18 --> 12.86]  ...
[12.86 --> 13.86]  ...
[13.86 --> 16.86]  ...
[16.86 --> 17.86]  ...
[17.86 --> 19.86]  ...
[19.86 --> 20.86]  ...
[20.86 --> 21.86]  ...
[21.86 --> 22.86]  ...
[22.86 --> 23.86]  ...
[23.86 --> 24.86]  ...
[24.86 --> 25.86]  ...
[25.86 --> 27.86]  ...
[27.86 --> 29.86]  ...
[29.86 --> 46.36]  ...
[54.06 --> 57.94]  ...
[57.94 --> 59.66]  ...
[59.66 --> 65.14]  The Lion of Judah is roaring with power
[65.14 --> 67.98]  And fighting our battles
[67.98 --> 72.94]  And every knee will bow before Him
[72.94 --> 76.02]  Our God in the Lamb
[76.02 --> 78.86]  The Lamb that was slain
[78.86 --> 81.50]  And the sinner of the world
[81.50 --> 84.26]  His blood breaks the chains
[84.26 --> 89.66]  And every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb
[89.66 --> 95.62]  Oh, every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb
[95.62 --> 97.70]  Oh, Jesus, oh
[97.70 --> 99.82]  Oh, Jesus, oh
[99.82 --> 101.26]  Oh, Jesus, oh
[101.26 --> 103.26]  Oh, Jesus, oh
[103.26 --> 105.26]  Oh, Jesus, oh
[105.26 --> 107.54]  So open up the gates
[107.54 --> 112.36]  Make way before the King of Kings
[112.36 --> 118.46]  Our God who calls the slave
[118.46 --> 122.52]  Is here to set the captives free
[122.52 --> 126.66]  But who can stop the Lord Almighty
[126.66 --> 130.52]  Our God is the Lion
[130.52 --> 133.20]  The Lion of Judah
[133.20 --> 136.02]  He's roaring with power
[136.02 --> 138.84]  And fighting our battles
[138.84 --> 143.94]  And every knee will bow before Him
[143.94 --> 146.94]  Our God is the Lamb
[146.94 --> 149.78]  The Lamb that was slain
[149.78 --> 152.38]  For the sin of the world
[152.38 --> 155.18]  His blood breaks the chains
[155.18 --> 160.58]  And every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb
[160.58 --> 166.84]  Oh, every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb
[166.84 --> 180.84]  Who can stop the Lord Almighty
[180.84 --> 184.66]  Who can stop the Lord Almighty
[184.66 --> 212.36]  I've got a canh
[212.36 --> 218.36]  Almighty, who can stop the love?
[221.06 --> 226.02]  Our God is the lion, the lion of Judah.
[226.02 --> 231.72]  He's roaring with power and fighting the battles.
[232.32 --> 236.40]  Every knee will bow before Him.
[236.40 --> 242.46]  Our God is the lamb, the lamb that was slain.
[242.90 --> 247.92]  For the sin of the world, His blood breaks the chains.
[247.92 --> 253.30]  And every knee will bow before the lion is the lamb.
[253.78 --> 260.42]  Every knee will bow before the lion is the lamb.
[260.42 --> 270.42]  Oh, and every knee will bow before the lion is the lamb.
[271.42 --> 281.42]  Oh, and every knee will bow before the lion is the lamb.
[281.42 --> 298.42]  Oh, and every knee will bow before the lion is the lamb.
[298.42 --> 302.42]  Oh, and every knee will bow before the lion is the lamb.
[302.42 --> 303.42]  That sounds good.
[332.42 --> 333.42]  That sounds good.
[362.42 --> 392.40]  That sounds good.
[392.42 --> 422.40]  That sounds good.
[422.42 --> 427.42]  That sounds good.
[427.42 --> 432.42]  That sounds good.
[432.42 --> 437.42]  That sounds good.
[437.42 --> 442.42]  That sounds good.
[442.42 --> 446.42]  That sounds good.
[446.42 --> 451.42]  That sounds good.
[451.42 --> 456.42]  That sounds good.
[456.42 --> 461.42]  That sounds good.
[461.42 --> 466.42]  That sounds good.
[466.42 --> 470.42]  That sounds good.
[470.42 --> 471.42]  That sounds good.
[471.42 --> 472.42]  That sounds good.
[472.42 --> 474.42]  That sounds good.
[474.42 --> 475.42]  That sounds good.
[475.42 --> 477.58] port.tip to a festival.
[481.70 --> 483.50]  Do we want meet or analyses?
[488.38 --> 490.78]  Married aettahh support family.
[505.42 --> 525.60]  Oh, you make beautiful things, you make beautiful things out of the world.
[527.08 --> 534.90]  Oh, you make beautiful things, you make beautiful things.
[535.42 --> 544.90]  Good morning, everyone.
[548.08 --> 548.96]  It's good, it's good.
[549.02 --> 549.56]  It's good enough.
[549.64 --> 550.08]  Good enough.
[550.56 --> 551.16]  Rough start.
[551.28 --> 551.84]  It's fine.
[551.94 --> 552.40]  It's raining.
[552.56 --> 553.02]  It's August.
[553.02 --> 559.08]  It's still so good to be joining here together on this Sunday morning as God's people.
[559.18 --> 560.70]  I've got a few announcements this morning.
[560.88 --> 562.10]  My name is Kevin Lobert.
[562.16 --> 563.32]  I'm the youth pastor here.
[563.32 --> 567.40]  And I want to make mention of just a few things before we kind of start in earnest.
[568.08 --> 572.42]  The first thing is after the service, there's going to be a table out in the foyer.
[572.66 --> 575.28]  And on that table are going to be a whole bunch of books.
[576.00 --> 581.86]  We have a few people, Warren and Janet, are going through our library and are zhuzhing
[581.86 --> 582.48]  it up a bit.
[582.54 --> 583.38]  They're cleaning it out.
[583.98 --> 586.58]  They are making it a little bit more accessible for everyone.
[586.58 --> 591.02]  And by doing that, we're emptying it out a little bit.
[591.12 --> 592.76]  And so there's going to be a lot of books on the table.
[592.88 --> 594.02]  Those are free for the taking.
[594.56 --> 598.46]  So I was told to make mention that those are there for you to take home and to have.
[598.92 --> 600.64]  And hopefully people take lots.
[601.08 --> 601.90]  That's what I was told.
[601.90 --> 604.38]  So please do check that out after the service.
[604.92 --> 607.82]  You'll also notice in the foyer we have backpacks on a table.
[607.94 --> 610.24]  We are doing a backpack drive for Gateway of Hope.
[610.78 --> 616.10]  Gateway of Hope supplies about 700 to 900 backpacks for low-income families all through
[616.10 --> 617.10]  the Langley area.
[617.58 --> 621.92]  And they are looking to raise about $5,000 to purchase those backpacks.
[622.00 --> 622.84]  They have a supplier.
[623.08 --> 625.16]  So they don't want backpacks donated.
[625.60 --> 627.80]  They're just looking for money so that they can purchase those.
[627.80 --> 631.36]  So we are looking to raise $5,000 before Labor Day.
[631.82 --> 636.44]  If you are willing to donate to that, you can do so through the church by e-transferring
[636.44 --> 638.74]  admin at licrc.ca.
[639.24 --> 646.10]  Or you can put checks or money that is specially labeled into the offering bags as they come
[646.10 --> 646.42]  around.
[646.82 --> 649.48]  So please do consider if that's a way that you can give as well.
[649.88 --> 651.54]  Finally, a big thank you again.
[652.02 --> 653.20]  Reactivate is coming up.
[653.28 --> 657.00]  That's a big youth conference happening first weekend, full weekend in September.
[657.00 --> 658.84]  September 5, 6, and 7.
[659.22 --> 661.90]  The volunteer list is filling out, and we're grateful for that.
[661.98 --> 663.22]  There are still some spots available.
[663.38 --> 666.70]  So please do think about helping out in that way.
[667.14 --> 671.54]  We look forward to that weekend very much as that comes soon.
[671.76 --> 673.40]  I'm going to invite Brandon up to the front.
[673.50 --> 675.56]  He's got an announcement about Mexico.
[676.42 --> 679.16]  And then I will have one more as well after he is done.
[679.16 --> 680.16]  Yeah.
[680.16 --> 687.50]  So it's pretty obvious when I'm up here what time of the year it is in the season.
[688.16 --> 689.50]  It is Mexico sign-up.
[690.14 --> 693.86]  We started earlier again, just like last year, just because everything books up so fast.
[693.86 --> 698.50]  So this will be kind of the longer announcement where we have a bit of the details.
[698.64 --> 700.42]  And after that, you guys don't have to listen to me talk as much.
[700.48 --> 701.62]  We'll just make a little bit of the announcements.
[702.70 --> 706.16]  So the dates for the trip this year are March 14 to 24.
[706.58 --> 710.00]  Always that last day is a little bit fickle depending on what the flights actually are.
[710.16 --> 713.00]  But that's what it will be, just be over spring break like normal.
[713.80 --> 717.08]  Vernon and Emmanuel will be doing it together again, which is awesome to see.
[717.80 --> 721.62]  Vernon even thought it was so important that they sent a representative today.
[721.62 --> 723.38]  So Shane Vanderhoek is actually here.
[724.00 --> 727.62]  If you have any questions about what Vernon feels like with that, just find the guy that
[727.62 --> 728.34]  looks like a Vanderhoek.
[728.42 --> 729.08]  They all look the same.
[729.26 --> 730.52]  So real easy.
[732.26 --> 735.06]  The trip this year, unfortunately, is going up in cost.
[735.30 --> 737.28]  It is going to $1,300 this year.
[737.50 --> 741.80]  We try to keep it at $1,150 for, I think, ever since I was a youth.
[741.90 --> 743.08]  So like a lot of years ago.
[744.30 --> 747.44]  But it's just the dollar and cost, everything's going up.
[747.48 --> 748.96]  So we are raising the price of the trip.
[748.96 --> 752.50]  And hopefully we can kind of offset that with fundraisers.
[752.64 --> 754.04]  But it will be $1,300 a person.
[755.06 --> 755.68]  And then the last thing.
[755.84 --> 759.42]  So again, this trip is youth leaders, everybody.
[759.58 --> 760.78]  But adults are also welcome.
[761.12 --> 763.88]  We're also kind of doing a special plea for more adults this year.
[764.58 --> 768.12]  The reason being is we do, like Kevin was saying, we do reactivate down here.
[768.18 --> 769.36]  We also do it in Mexico.
[770.18 --> 772.38]  In Mexico, it's a little bit different.
[772.44 --> 773.92]  We did it for the first time last year.
[773.92 --> 780.22]  And I guess you could put it in Langley kind of, I don't know how to say this without being mean to us.
[780.30 --> 780.98]  But it's fine.
[782.42 --> 786.24]  In Mexico, they really follow, like they dream big.
[786.86 --> 788.88]  And they kind of go to God with that.
[788.94 --> 789.92]  And we do as well here.
[789.96 --> 794.42]  But I find often we kind of, we put God into like a realistic box.
[794.42 --> 795.86]  And say, you know, God can do whatever.
[796.04 --> 796.84]  And he can do everything.
[797.22 --> 799.92]  But, you know, realistically, there's only going to be 50 people that come to us or whatever.
[800.00 --> 802.00]  And that's what we thought with reactivate in Mexico too.
[802.68 --> 804.28]  But Abilino's like, nah, nah, nah, nah.
[804.34 --> 805.04]  You got to dream big.
[805.10 --> 806.40]  There's going to be over 100 people coming.
[806.56 --> 811.42]  So our first year, we had 150 people come to reactivate in Mexico, which was crazy.
[811.66 --> 814.10]  And God really did show up for us.
[815.12 --> 819.20]  But that being said, Abilino's dream for this year is over 300 people.
[820.08 --> 822.18]  And, you know, that's a lot of people.
[822.18 --> 827.42]  And we kind of come to trust that Abilino's wild dreams and wild ideas do come true.
[828.20 --> 832.60]  In that case, we need a lot more adults to help lead the reactivate weekend.
[832.88 --> 835.50]  As we do for our youth are not leaders for that.
[835.58 --> 839.12]  We let them go as kind of participants in the trip.
[839.18 --> 840.22]  So it's all done by leaders.
[840.50 --> 841.68]  It's all done by adults.
[842.16 --> 843.86]  The organization that set up the prep.
[844.10 --> 847.02]  And then the actual facilitating of the reactivate.
[847.22 --> 850.16]  So we would prefer to have a little bit more people there.
[850.24 --> 852.80]  And I think that's Vernon's focus too is to get a little bit more adults as well.
[852.80 --> 855.92]  But I know every year adults talk about coming and they never do.
[856.06 --> 857.12]  This is the year to come.
[857.40 --> 859.14]  So we'll call you out on that.
[859.22 --> 861.72]  And we'll call out all the people that always say they want to come.
[862.42 --> 863.92]  But beyond that, that's kind of everything.
[864.16 --> 866.50]  We will start meeting in kind of like last year.
[866.56 --> 868.58]  The end of October will be our first meeting or so.
[869.12 --> 871.66]  And we meet every kind of two to three weeks after that.
[872.02 --> 873.92]  Of course, holidays we don't and stuff like that.
[874.64 --> 877.90]  But we will meet from then until the trip to do prepping, planning.
[877.90 --> 882.02]  And just prepping you guys for the culture and all that fun stuff.
[882.18 --> 883.40]  So that's about it.
[883.92 --> 884.88]  That's the long one.
[885.04 --> 886.60]  After that, it'll just be a reminder to sign up.
[886.70 --> 888.80]  The sign up will be online only this year.
[889.20 --> 893.16]  And it'll go out in the bulletin and the midweek memo.
[893.50 --> 895.16]  Starting on Wednesday, I believe that is, right?
[895.32 --> 896.42]  Yeah, Wednesday is the midweek memo.
[896.50 --> 897.62]  So it'll be in there.
[897.70 --> 898.24]  There'll be a link.
[898.40 --> 899.98]  You sign up, fill out all your info real quick.
[900.44 --> 903.54]  Then it gets sent off to the leaders of the trip to review.
[903.86 --> 905.20]  So yeah, thank you.
[905.20 --> 910.58]  And then finally, one more piggybacking that announcement.
[910.74 --> 914.80]  Some of you may have read in the bulletin that Abilino, the pastor down there that we work so close with,
[915.04 --> 919.54]  that's planning on 300 kids coming to his conference there in September.
[919.54 --> 921.24]  He had a bad accident this week.
[921.96 --> 924.04]  His hand met a table saw.
[925.24 --> 929.86]  And down there, just the health plan and the way things work are a little bit dicey.
[929.86 --> 935.90]  He needs to have surgery, and he needs to have surgery soon to get full mobility back in his hand.
[936.44 --> 938.06]  But surgery costs money.
[938.56 --> 941.88]  And they down in Mexico don't do surgery unless you pay up the money.
[941.98 --> 943.84]  And so there is a GoFundMe available.
[944.04 --> 948.58]  If Abilino is someone that's close to your heart, please do check out those links in the bulletin.
[948.96 --> 951.50]  You can donate to that cause through there.
[951.88 --> 953.58]  And he's hoping to have surgery soon.
[953.58 --> 956.36]  So if that's something that's on your heart, you can do that.
[956.62 --> 963.76]  Beyond the money, though, of course, we do ask for prayers more than anything as he sort of battles that accident
[963.76 --> 966.48]  and sees how that can affect his ministry down there.
[967.44 --> 967.94]  All right.
[968.58 --> 969.60]  Those are all the announcements.
[969.92 --> 970.92]  We're only seven minutes in.
[970.96 --> 971.86]  That was pretty good today.
[971.96 --> 975.88]  Let's all stand right now and receive God's greeting this morning.
[975.88 --> 997.46]  God's greeting comes to us today from Revelation chapter 1, where God greets us with these words,
[997.46 --> 1003.02]  grace and peace to you from him who is and who was and who is to come,
[1003.30 --> 1006.00]  and from the seven spirits that are before his throne,
[1006.20 --> 1009.32]  and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness,
[1009.78 --> 1013.82]  the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth,
[1013.82 --> 1015.34]  and all of God's people said.
[1016.38 --> 1018.34]  Please take a moment now to greet one another.
[1027.46 --> 1053.50]  Our call to worship this morning is Psalm 93.
[1053.50 --> 1059.02]  The Lord reigns.
[1059.02 --> 1060.26]  Should I start again?
[1060.50 --> 1060.60]  Yeah.
[1061.66 --> 1062.88]  The Lord reigns.
[1063.36 --> 1064.58]  He is robed in majesty.
[1065.10 --> 1068.78]  The Lord is robed in majesty and armed with strength.
[1069.78 --> 1073.02]  Indeed, the world is established, firm and secure.
[1073.76 --> 1075.66]  Your throne was established long ago.
[1076.28 --> 1078.12]  You are from all eternity.
[1079.18 --> 1081.30]  Your statutes, Lord, stand firm.
[1081.30 --> 1085.10]  Holiness adorns your house for endless days.
[1085.76 --> 1086.30]  Let's worship.
[1086.30 --> 1086.38]  Let's worship.
[1086.38 --> 1086.46]  Let's worship.
[1086.46 --> 1090.52]  Let's worship.
[1090.52 --> 1106.46]  Let's worship.
[1106.46 --> 1111.52]  be M Analytic.
[1113.14 --> 1119.78]  Mloop for Pearl
[1119.78 --> 1121.10]  in majesty.
[1124.52 --> 1126.08]  Mloop for RUSSIA
[1127.46 --> 1132.42]  In the Lord at thee.
[1132.42 --> 1146.02]  is
[1151.86 --> 1156.18]  foreign
[1160.42 --> 1161.30]  달
[1162.42 --> 1166.72]  Worship His majesty
[1166.72 --> 1170.98]  Jesus who died
[1170.98 --> 1173.06]  Now glorified
[1173.06 --> 1176.42]  King of all kings
[1176.42 --> 1180.60]  Worship His majesty
[1180.60 --> 1185.46]  Worship His majesty
[1185.46 --> 1189.72]  Unto Jesus
[1189.72 --> 1196.16]  Heal glory, honor, and praise
[1196.16 --> 1198.98]  Majesty
[1198.98 --> 1203.82]  King of all kings
[1203.82 --> 1207.64]  Above His throne
[1207.64 --> 1209.96]  Unto His own
[1209.96 --> 1212.82]  Is at the grave
[1212.82 --> 1216.82]  So exalted
[1216.82 --> 1218.92]  Lift up on fire
[1218.92 --> 1222.08]  The name of Jesus
[1222.08 --> 1226.08]  Make Him find
[1226.08 --> 1231.26]  Glorify Christ Jesus the King
[1231.26 --> 1235.26]  Majesty
[1235.26 --> 1240.08]  Worship His majesty
[1240.08 --> 1244.46]  Jesus who died
[1244.46 --> 1246.62]  Now glorified
[1246.62 --> 1249.34]  King of all kings
[1249.34 --> 1252.52]  Jesus who died
[1252.52 --> 1258.52]  Now glorified
[1258.52 --> 1267.78]  I see the King of glory
[1267.78 --> 1280.78]  I see the King of glory
[1280.78 --> 1284.94]  Coming on a fountain
[1284.94 --> 1289.04]  The polar chains
[1289.04 --> 1293.04]  The polar chains
[1293.04 --> 1299.04]  The seas on earth's sea
[1299.04 --> 1303.04]  Launching over all our sin
[1303.04 --> 1306.58]  The people sing
[1306.58 --> 1309.30]  The people sing
[1309.30 --> 1312.30]  Hosanna
[1312.30 --> 1314.30]  Hosanna
[1314.30 --> 1315.30]  Hosanna

[1317.30 --> 1319.30]  In the highest
[1319.30 --> 1321.30]  Hosanna
[1321.30 --> 1324.30]  Hosanna
[1324.30 --> 1325.30]  Hosanna
[1325.30 --> 1327.30]  Hosanna
[1328.02 --> 1329.24]  Hosanna
[1329.24 --> 1330.06]  Hosanna

[1330.34 --> 1332.12]  In the highest
[1332.12 --> 1332.34]  Hosanna
[1332.34 --> 1333.12]  Hosanna
[1333.30 --> 1333.98]  Hosanna
[1333.98 --> 1336.38]  Hosanna
[1336.38 --> 1337.52]  Hosanna
[1338.62 --> 1339.56]  Hosanna
[1339.56 --> 1341.80]  Hosanna
[1341.80 --> 1342.56]  Hosanna
[1342.56 --> 1343.78]  Hosanna
[1343.78 --> 1344.52]  Hosanna
[1344.52 --> 1345.50]  Hosanna
[1345.54 --> 1345.90]  fodара
[1345.90 --> 1346.52]  In the highest
[1346.52 --> 1348.08]  Hosanna
[1348.08 --> 1348.50]  Hosanna
[1348.50 --> 1349.24]  Hosanna
[1349.24 --> 1349.68]  Hosanna
[1349.68 --> 1349.72]  Hosanna
[1349.72 --> 1350.14]  Hosanna
[1350.14 --> 1355.14]  this selfless day
[1355.14 --> 1359.58]  I see a near revival
[1359.58 --> 1365.50]  staring as we pray and sing
[1365.50 --> 1368.62]  we're on our knees
[1368.62 --> 1372.50]  we're on our knees
[1372.50 --> 1377.78]  Hosanna, Hosanna
[1377.78 --> 1382.26]  Hosanna in the highest
[1382.26 --> 1389.66]  Hosanna, Hosanna
[1389.66 --> 1394.46]  Hosanna in the highest
[1394.46 --> 1410.34]  Fill my heart and make it clear
[1410.34 --> 1416.72]  Open up my eyes to the things I see
[1416.72 --> 1421.20]  Show me how to love like you
[1421.20 --> 1425.32]  And love me
[1425.32 --> 1434.46]  Break my heart for our grace yours
[1434.46 --> 1438.78]  Everything I am for your kingdom
[1438.78 --> 1446.94]  As I walk the earth into eternity
[1446.94 --> 1457.34]  Hosanna, Hosanna
[1457.34 --> 1466.82]  Hosanna, Hosanna
[1466.82 --> 1469.22]  Hosanna, Hosanna
[1469.22 --> 1473.82]  Hosanna in the highest
[1473.82 --> 1480.22]  Hosanna, Hosanna
[1480.22 --> 1496.10]  Hosanna, Hosanna
[1496.10 --> 1498.70]  Hosanna in the highest
[1498.70 --> 1502.70]  Hosanna in the highest
[1502.70 --> 1504.70]  Hosanna in the highest
[1504.70 --> 1509.24]  Hosanna in the highest
[1509.24 --> 1510.84]  I invite you to be seated
[1510.84 --> 1515.08]  And pray with me
[1515.08 --> 1518.74]  Sovereign God
[1518.74 --> 1523.30]  We confess that although we willingly say
[1523.30 --> 1524.84]  Jesus is King
[1524.84 --> 1527.32]  Singing His praises
[1527.32 --> 1530.98]  We often fail to bow our knees before Him
[1530.98 --> 1533.30]  And open our hearts to Him
[1533.30 --> 1538.14]  Instead we grant our allegiances to the relationships
[1538.14 --> 1540.52]  And material goods of this world
[1540.52 --> 1542.82]  In your mercy
[1542.82 --> 1545.26]  Hear our prayer of confession
[1545.26 --> 1566.04]  Lord
[1566.04 --> 1568.66]  Forgive us for the gods we have created
[1568.66 --> 1571.92]  Grant us the humility to bow before You
[1571.92 --> 1573.68]  The ruler of all the nations
[1573.68 --> 1576.28]  So that we may be your loyal servants
[1576.28 --> 1577.28]  In your kingdom
[1577.28 --> 1579.66]  Remind us of your grace
[1579.66 --> 1580.96]  Through your Son
[1580.96 --> 1582.26]  The King of Kings
[1582.26 --> 1583.46]  And the Lord of Lords
[1583.46 --> 1584.50]  Amen
[1584.50 --> 1588.28]  Let's pray for the Lord of Us
[1588.28 --> 1589.28]  Amen.
[1618.28 --> 1641.28]  Only by grace can we enter, only by grace can we stand, not by our human endeavor, but by the blood of the Lamb.
[1641.28 --> 1663.94]  Into your presence you call us, you call us to come, into your presence you draw us, and now by your grace we come.
[1663.94 --> 1670.94]  Now by your grace we come.
[1670.94 --> 1682.94]  Lord, if you mark our transgressions, who was dead?
[1682.94 --> 1694.94]  Thanks to your grace we are cleansed by the blood of the Lamb.
[1694.94 --> 1706.94]  Lord, if you mark our transgressions, who was dead?
[1706.94 --> 1719.94]  Thanks to your grace we are cleansed by the blood of the Lamb.
[1719.94 --> 1746.94]  Only by grace can we enter, only by grace can we stand, not by our human endeavor, but by the blood of the Lamb.
[1746.94 --> 1757.94]  Into your presence you call us, you call us to come.
[1758.94 --> 1768.94]  Into your presence you draw us, and now by your grace we come.
[1768.94 --> 1775.94]  Now by your grace we come.
[1775.94 --> 1778.94]  You call us, and now by your grace we come.
[1778.94 --> 1780.94]  And now by your grace we come.
[1780.94 --> 1781.44]  Thank you.
[1781.44 --> 1789.94]  .
[1789.94 --> 1817.94]  We praise thee, O God, for the Son of our love.
[1817.94 --> 1825.20]  For Jesus who died and is now God of earth.
[1825.62 --> 1828.50]  Hallelujah, find the glory.
[1828.88 --> 1831.24]  Hallelujah, amen.
[1832.16 --> 1835.18]  Hallelujah, find the glory.
[1835.58 --> 1838.38]  Revive us again.
[1840.46 --> 1846.42]  Praise thee, O God, for the Spirit of life.
[1846.42 --> 1852.92]  Who has shown us our Savior and scattered our eyes.
[1853.44 --> 1856.18]  Hallelujah, find the glory.
[1856.68 --> 1858.98]  Hallelujah, amen.
[1859.86 --> 1862.70]  Hallelujah, find the glory.
[1863.24 --> 1865.42]  Revive us again.
[1865.42 --> 1865.84]  Amen.
[1867.84 --> 1874.06]  Oh, glory and praise to the Lamb that was slain.
[1874.42 --> 1880.24]  Who has borne all our sins and has spent every stain.
[1880.70 --> 1883.52]  Hallelujah, find the glory.
[1883.94 --> 1886.18]  Hallelujah, amen.
[1886.18 --> 1890.00]  Hallelujah, find the glory.
[1890.36 --> 1892.68]  Revive us again.
[1895.18 --> 1897.94]  Revive us again.
[1897.94 --> 1901.28]  Fill this heart with my love.
[1901.68 --> 1907.68]  Each soul be repindled with fire from the earth.
[1907.68 --> 1910.40]  Hallelujah, find the glory.
[1910.40 --> 1913.62]  Hallelujah, amen.
[1914.38 --> 1917.40]  Hallelujah, find the glory.
[1918.06 --> 1920.12]  Revive us again.
[1921.12 --> 1923.82]  Hallelujah, find the glory.
[1924.28 --> 1926.56]  Hallelujah, amen.
[1927.42 --> 1930.42]  Hallelujah, find the glory.
[1930.42 --> 1934.70]  Revive us again
[1960.42 --> 1973.06]  Hello, my name is Allison and I am one of the deacons here at Langley Emanuel.
[1973.78 --> 1985.98]  This morning, the offerings, the first one, as normal, is for the LACRC, our own church ministry and missions budget.
[1985.98 --> 1993.32]  The second one, the special offering today, is for Sanctuary Mental Health Ministries.
[1993.82 --> 1995.78]  And let me just read what they say.
[1996.44 --> 2002.14]  Sanctuary Mental Health Ministries equips the church to support mental health and well-being.
[2003.12 --> 2008.76]  They provide resources that meaningfully engage the topics of faith and mental health.
[2008.76 --> 2020.10]  Our content is developed in collaboration with theologians, mental health professionals, and people with lived experience of mental health challenges.
[2020.78 --> 2033.18]  These resources prepare communities of faith around the world to raise awareness, reduce stigma, support mental health, and promote mental well-being.
[2033.18 --> 2038.74]  So these two things are very important in our community.
[2039.32 --> 2054.64]  So please give as the Lord has prospered you, either online or through the offerings in the envelopes in the chairs in front of you, or by check.
[2055.10 --> 2056.40]  Thank you very much.
[2056.40 --> 2086.38]  Thank you.
[2086.40 --> 2116.38]  Thank you.
[2116.38 --> 2118.38]  Thank you.
[2118.38 --> 2122.38]  Thank you.
[2122.48 --> 2124.38]  Thank you.
[2124.38 --> 2128.38]  Thank you.
[2128.38 --> 2135.78]  Open the eyes of my heart, Lord
[2135.78 --> 2139.28]  Open the eyes of my heart
[2139.28 --> 2142.62]  I want to see you
[2142.62 --> 2147.38]  I want to see you
[2147.38 --> 2153.88]  Open the eyes of my heart, Lord
[2153.88 --> 2157.28]  Open the eyes of my heart
[2157.28 --> 2161.28]  I want to see you
[2161.28 --> 2166.28]  I want to see you
[2166.28 --> 2171.28]  See you high and lifted up
[2171.28 --> 2176.28]  Shining in the light of your glory
[2176.28 --> 2179.28]  Pour out your power and love
[2179.28 --> 2184.28]  As we sing holy, holy, holy
[2184.28 --> 2188.28]  Holy, holy, holy
[2188.28 --> 2193.28]  Holy, holy, holy
[2193.28 --> 2197.28]  Holy, holy, holy
[2197.28 --> 2202.28]  Holy, holy, holy
[2202.28 --> 2209.36]  Holy, holy, holy
[2209.36 --> 2213.94]  Holy, holy, holy
[2213.94 --> 2218.42]  Holy, holy, holy
[2218.42 --> 2221.94]  I want to see you
[2223.66 --> 2227.58]  Holy, holy, holy
[2227.58 --> 2232.18]  Holy, holy, holy
[2232.18 --> 2236.78]  Holy, holy, holy
[2236.78 --> 2240.48]  I want to see you
[2251.82 --> 2255.26]  I would love to invite all of the kids to come up front right now.
[2255.26 --> 2265.14]  If you are three years old or up to kindergarten or maybe a little bit older than that or maybe a lot older than that and you want to come up front, you are welcome to do so right now.
[2272.66 --> 2274.38]  Good morning, everyone.
[2274.86 --> 2275.68]  Do you want to come sit?
[2276.08 --> 2277.02]  Do you want to come sit right here?
[2277.62 --> 2278.80]  How are you all doing?
[2279.92 --> 2281.78]  Did you get outside in the rain this weekend?
[2283.00 --> 2284.20]  You lost a tooth.
[2285.26 --> 2286.80]  You lost a tooth too?
[2287.02 --> 2288.12]  Well, where did you lose it?
[2288.24 --> 2289.20]  In the New York.
[2289.68 --> 2291.46]  Oh, look at that.
[2291.52 --> 2292.84]  There's so many holes in your mouths.
[2295.68 --> 2296.12]  Yeah?
[2297.76 --> 2298.72]  Oh, you did too?
[2298.90 --> 2299.06]  Yeah?
[2299.06 --> 2300.42]  I don't know.
[2304.02 --> 2306.88]  Oh, yeah?
[2306.88 --> 2311.62]  This will just take a second.
[2314.54 --> 2315.42]  Very cool.
[2316.58 --> 2316.94]  Yeah?
[2317.22 --> 2319.72]  Well, let's talk more about this in the back room.
[2319.76 --> 2320.28]  What do you think?
[2320.54 --> 2323.86]  I'm sure today's lesson has all to do with losing teeth.
[2325.86 --> 2326.26]  No?
[2326.26 --> 2328.40]  I'm wondering what to do.
[2328.40 --> 2328.44]  I'm wondering what to do.
[2328.44 --> 2328.52]  I'm wondering what to do.
[2328.52 --> 2329.30]  I'm wondering what to do.
[2329.30 --> 2330.82]  What we're going to do.
[2331.16 --> 2332.60]  Okay, one more comment.
[2332.78 --> 2332.92]  Yep?
[2333.68 --> 2335.98]  It's my baby's birthday today.
[2335.98 --> 2337.30]  It's your baby's birthday today.
[2337.80 --> 2339.44]  It's me 22.
[2340.02 --> 2341.56]  She's two years old.
[2342.02 --> 2343.76]  Wow, that is so exciting.
[2344.68 --> 2346.20]  We should celebrate.
[2346.60 --> 2347.02]  We should celebrate.
[2347.80 --> 2348.10]  Yeah?
[2348.30 --> 2349.08]  That's great.
[2349.58 --> 2354.18]  What we're going to do now is we'll celebrate a children's worship time and we'll pray before
[2354.18 --> 2355.46]  we go and then we'll do the blessing.
[2355.56 --> 2356.20]  Does that sound good?
[2356.64 --> 2356.86]  Yeah?
[2357.20 --> 2357.46]  All right.
[2357.50 --> 2359.76]  Let's pray and then we'll do the blessing together.
[2359.84 --> 2360.02]  Deal?
[2360.74 --> 2360.96]  All right.
[2360.98 --> 2362.28]  Let's fold our hands, close our eyes, and we're going to pray.
[2362.34 --> 2362.64]  We're going to pray.
[2362.70 --> 2363.08]  We're going to pray.
[2363.18 --> 2363.56]  We're going to pray.
[2363.90 --> 2365.42]  Dear God, thank you so much for this day.
[2365.74 --> 2368.76]  Thank you that we could come to church today, that we could go to children's worship time,
[2368.82 --> 2369.98]  that we could learn more about you.
[2370.38 --> 2374.50]  Be with us now as we go to children's worship time, as the adults stay here and open up
[2374.50 --> 2374.94]  the Bible.
[2375.38 --> 2377.10]  Help us learn what it means to follow you.
[2377.14 --> 2377.50]  In your name.
[2377.80 --> 2378.00]  Amen.
[2378.44 --> 2379.98]  Okay, before we go, let's stand up.
[2380.02 --> 2380.98]  No, come back, come back, come back.
[2380.98 --> 2385.64]  We're going to all stand up and we're going to say really loudly, the Lord be with you.
[2385.70 --> 2385.98]  Okay?
[2386.08 --> 2386.76]  On the count of three.
[2386.84 --> 2387.60]  Are you ready, kids?
[2387.84 --> 2389.34]  One, two, three.
[2389.52 --> 2391.92]  The Lord be with you.
[2392.22 --> 2394.04]  And also with you.
[2410.98 --> 2439.40]  Good morning.
[2439.40 --> 2441.70]  My name is Clary Closteroff.
[2441.84 --> 2445.04]  I am an elder here at Emmanuel.
[2445.70 --> 2451.18]  And I'm going to lead us or walk us through our congregational prayer.
[2452.06 --> 2455.40]  But before I do that, I have another announcement.
[2455.40 --> 2465.52]  On Tuesday, September the 16th, we are going to be having a special general meeting on calling
[2465.52 --> 2468.86]  Pastor Kevin Lobert as a minister of the word.
[2470.06 --> 2479.40]  This Thursday, members over the age of 18 are going to receive a copy of the agenda for
[2479.40 --> 2481.04]  that evening.
[2481.04 --> 2490.96]  The copy that you receive is going to have the motion and the proposed job description.
[2491.96 --> 2501.20]  We encourage everyone to prayerfully prepare and reflect on our past discussions, town halls,
[2501.48 --> 2503.10]  and information packages.
[2503.10 --> 2512.20]  If you have any questions, please talk with any members of admin council or an elder.
[2512.98 --> 2524.82]  Keep your eyes on your inbox for the email this coming Thursday, August 21, around 4 p.m.
[2524.82 --> 2533.78]  And of course, if you would like to have a paper copy, you're more than welcome to.
[2534.26 --> 2541.18]  Just call the office or come and ask the office for a copy and they'll happily provide one for you.
[2541.18 --> 2553.68]  So, now let's kind of switch gears and come before our maker in prayer.
[2553.68 --> 2568.56]  Our most merciful and gracious Father in heaven, we want to say thank you to you for another day.
[2568.56 --> 2578.90]  And we especially want to thank you, Lord, that we begin our work week by putting away our work,
[2579.64 --> 2586.16]  putting away our calendars and schedules and resting.
[2586.16 --> 2594.74]  And we begin this day of rest with the opportunity to corporately gather together,
[2595.24 --> 2604.34]  sing praises to you, reflect on the week, seek pardon and confession,
[2604.34 --> 2608.08]  and be fed from your word.
[2608.94 --> 2611.90]  Thank you for all of this.
[2612.44 --> 2614.20]  Thank you that it's so easy.
[2614.96 --> 2619.02]  We do not have to face a particular direction.
[2619.02 --> 2629.58]  We do not have to go through mandated and ordered phrases.
[2630.38 --> 2636.20]  But we come to you with our hearts, which is what you most want from us.
[2636.84 --> 2640.08]  And we can worship you.
[2641.00 --> 2641.90]  Thank you for this.
[2641.90 --> 2648.68]  And forgive us, Lord, when I think even for some of us olders in the room,
[2648.90 --> 2651.04]  this can become quite a mechanical practice.
[2651.54 --> 2656.04]  And we might even not engage with it.
[2656.76 --> 2659.84]  Help us to have hearts that are soft and pliable
[2659.84 --> 2668.16]  and wanting your spirit and your word to be at work in us.
[2669.44 --> 2672.14]  This morning, Lord, for our church family prayer,
[2672.80 --> 2677.80]  I think one of the bigger things for the planet that we want to remember
[2677.80 --> 2680.52]  is the war in Ukraine.
[2682.76 --> 2688.78]  Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump met, I think, on Friday.
[2688.78 --> 2691.12]  It's the first time since this war began
[2691.12 --> 2694.96]  where it looks like serious people are talking about peace.
[2695.10 --> 2697.16]  We ask that this may actually be the case
[2697.16 --> 2702.36]  and that you can bring peace to the devastation
[2702.36 --> 2710.26]  that has been unleashed with all of our engineering imagination
[2710.26 --> 2711.88]  and capacity and capability.
[2714.76 --> 2717.00]  Of course, this is not the only place in the world
[2717.00 --> 2718.12]  where there is violence, Lord,
[2718.12 --> 2721.44]  but we ask that peace may come.
[2723.00 --> 2725.20]  Now, looking more locally,
[2725.92 --> 2729.38]  Father, we want to ask that you continue to bring healing
[2729.38 --> 2732.80]  to Pastor Abelino
[2732.80 --> 2735.60]  as his hand heals
[2735.60 --> 2738.48]  and time is of the essence for surgery.
[2738.48 --> 2741.78]  We ask that he may be healed
[2741.78 --> 2751.94]  and that he may continue to use his gifts and talents
[2751.94 --> 2754.18]  to further your kingdom in his community.
[2754.18 --> 2760.52]  We want to lift up Doug Kendon, the father of Elise Wagener,
[2760.86 --> 2763.64]  as he continues dealing with cancer.
[2765.78 --> 2771.26]  And we ask or we want to give thanks that John Kuypers is okay.
[2771.50 --> 2779.00]  He was in some distress recently because of some of his medications reacting poorly with each other,
[2779.00 --> 2780.54]  but now he's on the mend.
[2780.54 --> 2787.02]  Thank you for so many skilled people who are able to focus their attention on him.
[2788.32 --> 2795.10]  Father, we ask for continued safety for fire and rescue services right here in Langley
[2795.10 --> 2801.30]  as they are, I think, finishing off putting out a fire in a new construction building.
[2801.30 --> 2805.52]  Thank you that so far there have been no reported injuries,
[2805.68 --> 2807.68]  but we ask for that continued blessing.
[2810.02 --> 2811.36]  We give you thanks, Lord, too,
[2811.52 --> 2815.94]  that we are in the middle or in the back end of the middle of summer
[2815.94 --> 2821.90]  and many of us have a chance for a change of pace
[2821.90 --> 2825.80]  and for getting together with friends and family.
[2827.48 --> 2828.98]  We thank you for all of this, Lord,
[2828.98 --> 2835.30]  and we are reminded that we live in a very, very wealthy part of the world.
[2836.18 --> 2841.10]  We ask that all of the additional traveling and vacationing that we can do,
[2841.78 --> 2845.24]  that in these things we can remember materially
[2845.24 --> 2849.58]  the gifts that we have that enable this
[2849.58 --> 2852.84]  and help us, too, to remember
[2852.84 --> 2855.92]  that with material blessings,
[2855.92 --> 2862.36]  there are greater expectations that you have of us for our own generosity.
[2863.04 --> 2864.34]  And we ask, too,
[2865.62 --> 2866.82]  that we can remember
[2866.82 --> 2869.72]  not to coast.
[2870.98 --> 2872.20]  As we look through Scripture,
[2872.38 --> 2874.78]  we see one of the big risks
[2874.78 --> 2876.74]  for people who love you
[2876.74 --> 2878.62]  is that when life becomes easy,
[2879.32 --> 2880.50]  we tend to think
[2880.50 --> 2883.16]  it's the work of our own hands.
[2883.16 --> 2885.38]  So help us to be mindful of that
[2885.38 --> 2889.00]  and to stay focused on you.
[2894.52 --> 2895.28]  Thank you, Lord,
[2895.64 --> 2896.92]  that here in our congregation
[2896.92 --> 2899.70]  we've had a number of weddings lately.
[2900.14 --> 2902.22]  We think of Jared Alkema,
[2902.92 --> 2903.70]  Ava Griffune,
[2904.48 --> 2905.74]  and Willem Casey,
[2906.06 --> 2906.84]  and Kaylee Spohr,
[2906.92 --> 2909.18]  who have been married in the last couple weeks.
[2909.18 --> 2911.48]  And we want to give you
[2911.48 --> 2914.72]  maybe a special offering of gratitude
[2914.72 --> 2919.56]  for the family of Steve and Linda Rook
[2919.56 --> 2922.76]  as they've had quite a month.
[2923.32 --> 2924.62]  Their daughter, Emily Rook,
[2924.66 --> 2927.52]  was married to Matt Siebert in July.
[2928.22 --> 2929.38]  Just a couple days ago,
[2929.48 --> 2931.96]  Matthew Rook and Bethany Hitchman
[2931.96 --> 2933.40]  were married.
[2933.40 --> 2935.24]  And Nicole and Matt Woods
[2935.24 --> 2939.06]  are now legal guardians for Liam.
[2939.70 --> 2944.76]  And this is all tremendous good news.
[2945.30 --> 2946.92]  And this past Monday,
[2947.02 --> 2947.98]  Steve and Linda celebrated
[2947.98 --> 2949.76]  their 35th anniversary.
[2950.02 --> 2951.82]  So we thank you, Father,
[2952.00 --> 2957.10]  for your steadfastness in their story.
[2957.10 --> 2964.42]  And Lord, we know too that here,
[2965.14 --> 2966.52]  outside of the things
[2966.52 --> 2968.10]  that I just mentioned briefly,
[2968.66 --> 2970.12]  we know that in our congregation
[2970.12 --> 2972.96]  we have so many other things
[2972.96 --> 2974.72]  for which people are very, very grateful.
[2975.34 --> 2977.24]  But we also are mindful
[2977.24 --> 2981.72]  that there are a lot of unspoken griefs.
[2981.94 --> 2983.68]  And we ask that your spirit,
[2984.06 --> 2986.86]  especially in our private griefs,
[2986.86 --> 2990.76]  that your spirit may continue ministering to us,
[2990.86 --> 2993.48]  but that we as a body of believers
[2993.48 --> 2996.86]  may seek to be a hand and foot
[2996.86 --> 2999.16]  in holding each other up
[2999.16 --> 3002.14]  with deeds and with prayers and words.
[3003.82 --> 3004.34]  Amen.
[3016.86 --> 3025.62]  Good morning, everyone.
[3026.96 --> 3031.80]  It is awesome to see some new faces this Sunday.
[3032.80 --> 3034.92]  I'm glad you can join us for worship.
[3036.86 --> 3038.76]  We're going to be looking at Matthew 21,
[3038.90 --> 3041.10]  verses 1 to 17 today in our series,
[3041.20 --> 3041.90]  Behold Our King.
[3042.68 --> 3043.76]  So I ask you,
[3043.80 --> 3045.40]  get out your Bibles or your devices.
[3046.10 --> 3047.84]  Get ready as we read out the passage.
[3048.48 --> 3050.62]  But as we read out the passage,
[3051.10 --> 3053.22]  notice how much of this passage
[3053.22 --> 3055.28]  is about Jesus' identity.
[3056.28 --> 3058.04]  And I don't mean what his name is.
[3058.86 --> 3060.46]  I mean who he is as a whole.
[3061.28 --> 3061.98]  Is he a king?
[3062.06 --> 3062.72]  Is he a prophet?
[3062.88 --> 3063.56]  Is he a priest?
[3063.90 --> 3064.62]  Is he more?
[3064.62 --> 3067.40]  Pay attention.
[3067.62 --> 3069.22]  Because when we see who Jesus is,
[3069.48 --> 3071.46]  we get a glimpse at who we are.
[3071.92 --> 3073.58]  And so understanding who he is is key.
[3077.48 --> 3078.26]  Let us read.
[3078.26 --> 3082.38]  As they approached Jerusalem
[3082.38 --> 3084.56]  and came to Bethpage,
[3084.88 --> 3085.86]  on the Mount of Olives,
[3086.04 --> 3087.78]  Jesus sent two disciples,
[3088.54 --> 3089.16]  saying to them,
[3089.32 --> 3090.92]  Go to the village ahead of you.
[3091.82 --> 3093.92]  And at once you will find a donkey tied there
[3093.92 --> 3094.98]  with her colt by her.
[3095.68 --> 3097.18]  Untie them and bring them to me.
[3097.74 --> 3099.46]  If anyone says anything to you,
[3099.60 --> 3101.18]  say that the Lord needs them,
[3101.64 --> 3103.30]  and he will send them right away.
[3104.36 --> 3105.98]  This took place to fulfill
[3105.98 --> 3107.48]  what was spoken through the prophet.
[3108.62 --> 3109.84]  Say to daughter Zion,
[3110.14 --> 3111.86]  See, your king comes to you.
[3112.94 --> 3114.78]  Gentle and riding on a donkey,
[3115.04 --> 3117.08]  and on a colt the foal of a donkey.
[3117.96 --> 3120.08]  The disciple went and did
[3120.08 --> 3121.52]  as Jesus had instructed them.
[3121.82 --> 3123.26]  They brought the donkey and the colt
[3123.26 --> 3124.66]  and placed their cloaks on them
[3124.66 --> 3126.12]  for Jesus to sit on.
[3126.94 --> 3128.74]  A very large crowd
[3128.74 --> 3130.86]  spread their cloaks on the road,
[3131.14 --> 3133.00]  while others cut branches from trees
[3133.00 --> 3134.06]  and spread them on the road.
[3136.14 --> 3137.78]  The crowds that went ahead of him
[3137.78 --> 3139.56]  and those that followed shouted,
[3139.68 --> 3141.22]  Hosanna to the son of David!
[3141.86 --> 3144.38]  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
[3145.10 --> 3146.82]  Hosanna in the highest heavens!
[3148.76 --> 3150.46]  When Jesus entered Jerusalem,
[3150.66 --> 3152.58]  the whole city was stirred and asked,
[3152.96 --> 3153.78]  Who is this?
[3153.78 --> 3156.32]  The crowd answered,
[3156.72 --> 3157.42]  This is Jesus,
[3157.60 --> 3158.96]  the prophet from Nazareth
[3158.96 --> 3160.24]  in Galilee.
[3162.44 --> 3164.12]  Jesus entered the temple courts
[3164.12 --> 3165.92]  and drove out all who were buying
[3165.92 --> 3167.08]  and selling there.
[3167.30 --> 3168.30]  He overturned the tables
[3168.30 --> 3169.10]  of the money changers
[3169.10 --> 3169.72]  and the benches
[3169.72 --> 3170.94]  of those selling doves.
[3171.66 --> 3172.36]  It is written,
[3172.48 --> 3173.74]  he said to them,
[3174.10 --> 3174.98]  My house will be called
[3174.98 --> 3175.68]  a house of prayer,
[3175.80 --> 3176.70]  but you are making it
[3176.70 --> 3177.82]  a den of robbers.
[3177.82 --> 3180.50]  The blind and the lame
[3180.50 --> 3181.60]  came to him at the temple
[3181.60 --> 3182.44]  and he healed them.
[3183.14 --> 3184.16]  But when the chief priests
[3184.16 --> 3185.14]  and the teachers of the law
[3185.14 --> 3186.54]  saw the wonderful things he did
[3186.54 --> 3187.44]  and the children shouting
[3187.44 --> 3188.36]  in the temple courts,
[3188.76 --> 3190.10]  Hosanna to the son of David!
[3190.60 --> 3191.60]  They were indignant.
[3191.60 --> 3194.68]  Do you hear what these children
[3194.68 --> 3195.70]  are saying?
[3195.84 --> 3196.72]  They asked him.
[3198.02 --> 3199.36]  Yes, Jesus replied.
[3199.84 --> 3200.72]  Have you never read?
[3201.56 --> 3202.72]  From the lips of the children
[3202.72 --> 3204.08]  and infants,
[3204.42 --> 3204.96]  you, Lord,
[3204.96 --> 3206.48]  have called forth your praise.
[3207.34 --> 3208.38]  And he left them
[3208.38 --> 3209.70]  and went out of the city
[3209.70 --> 3210.32]  to Bethany
[3210.32 --> 3211.82]  where he spent the night.
[3212.94 --> 3213.82]  The word of the Lord.
[3219.82 --> 3220.26]  Normally,
[3220.86 --> 3223.62]  we keep this passage to Easter.
[3224.70 --> 3225.56]  But sometimes,
[3225.68 --> 3226.70]  it's good to look at passages
[3226.70 --> 3228.48]  without the obvious message
[3228.48 --> 3229.92]  that gets associated with them.
[3230.88 --> 3231.36]  Sometimes,
[3231.50 --> 3232.56]  when we read certain passages
[3232.56 --> 3233.52]  with the same light
[3233.52 --> 3234.50]  and the same focus,
[3234.96 --> 3236.24]  it can cloud our minds
[3236.24 --> 3238.24]  to the rest of what's in the passage.
[3239.86 --> 3241.40]  Following the triumphal entry,
[3242.08 --> 3243.60]  we read Matthew's account
[3243.60 --> 3244.48]  of the temple cleansing
[3244.48 --> 3245.64]  by Jesus.
[3246.54 --> 3246.82]  Now,
[3247.02 --> 3248.44]  when I think of the temple cleansing,
[3248.96 --> 3251.00]  I think normally of John's account,
[3251.32 --> 3253.00]  which is where Jesus fashions a whip
[3253.00 --> 3254.52]  and he pushes the animals
[3254.52 --> 3255.02]  and the merchants
[3255.02 --> 3256.88]  to leave in a more violent fashion
[3256.88 --> 3258.06]  than Matthew records.
[3259.44 --> 3259.84]  However,
[3260.36 --> 3261.20]  Matthew's account
[3261.20 --> 3263.40]  highlights some key themes
[3263.40 --> 3264.60]  that John's doesn't.
[3265.26 --> 3265.76]  And together,
[3265.96 --> 3266.96]  the triumphal entry,
[3267.52 --> 3268.76]  followed by the temple cleansing,
[3269.28 --> 3271.68]  tell us something about our king.
[3271.78 --> 3272.74]  It gives us clarity
[3272.74 --> 3274.38]  about who he is.
[3275.34 --> 3277.12]  But it will also help us see
[3277.12 --> 3280.32]  that Jesus is not merely a king.
[3280.98 --> 3282.88]  We must behold Jesus
[3282.88 --> 3283.90]  as our king,
[3283.90 --> 3285.80]  but we cannot behold him
[3285.80 --> 3287.32]  as merely a king.
[3288.68 --> 3289.12]  Jesus,
[3289.36 --> 3290.58]  in this passage we are reading,
[3291.24 --> 3292.34]  is not just a man,
[3292.98 --> 3294.66]  nor is he just a king.
[3295.30 --> 3295.98]  And we get to see
[3295.98 --> 3297.54]  how Matthew is showing us
[3297.54 --> 3299.50]  that Jesus is so much more
[3299.50 --> 3300.70]  than we can imagine.
[3301.18 --> 3303.32]  And the fact that he is so much more
[3303.32 --> 3303.98]  than we can imagine
[3303.98 --> 3304.84]  is part of the reason
[3304.84 --> 3306.20]  it's sometimes hard
[3306.20 --> 3307.36]  to grasp him at all.
[3307.36 --> 3310.26]  He's not like everyone else
[3310.26 --> 3310.74]  in the Bible
[3310.74 --> 3312.00]  that plays a role,
[3312.90 --> 3314.26]  like David the king,
[3314.80 --> 3315.88]  Moses the prophet,
[3316.40 --> 3317.42]  Aaron the priest.
[3318.22 --> 3320.32]  These men played their parts well.
[3321.34 --> 3322.94]  They played their characters well.
[3323.64 --> 3325.48]  But Jesus does not look like David,
[3326.08 --> 3327.30]  though, as we will read,
[3327.40 --> 3328.66]  he is called the son of David
[3328.66 --> 3330.12]  and is prophesied
[3330.12 --> 3331.96]  to be the son of David
[3331.96 --> 3333.58]  who would reign forever
[3333.58 --> 3334.16]  on the throne.
[3334.16 --> 3335.82]  But when we see him
[3335.82 --> 3336.74]  perform miracles
[3336.74 --> 3338.16]  and preach God
[3338.16 --> 3339.04]  to God's people
[3339.04 --> 3340.66]  and deal with their stubbornness
[3340.66 --> 3341.52]  when they go,
[3341.70 --> 3342.80]  and when he goes away
[3342.80 --> 3343.78]  for periods of time
[3343.78 --> 3344.80]  to talk with his father,
[3345.56 --> 3347.12]  and even in his transfiguration,
[3347.82 --> 3348.70]  we see glimpses
[3348.70 --> 3349.70]  of Moses the prophet.
[3351.06 --> 3351.94]  And we even see
[3351.94 --> 3353.38]  a little bit of Aaron the priest
[3353.38 --> 3354.54]  when Jesus cleanses
[3354.54 --> 3355.42]  the temple of sin
[3355.42 --> 3356.48]  and impurity
[3356.48 --> 3357.94]  on the part of the merchants
[3357.94 --> 3358.60]  and the market.
[3360.94 --> 3362.36]  The duty of the priest
[3362.36 --> 3363.30]  is to consecrate
[3363.30 --> 3364.48]  and cleanse the temple
[3364.48 --> 3365.42]  and its implements
[3365.42 --> 3367.56]  and to keep them holy.
[3368.82 --> 3370.42]  But even knowing this,
[3370.60 --> 3371.52]  when we look at Jesus,
[3371.70 --> 3373.50]  we are still filled with wonder
[3373.50 --> 3375.18]  and we can do nothing
[3375.18 --> 3376.10]  but behold him.
[3377.52 --> 3378.50]  So we need to see
[3378.50 --> 3379.92]  what Matthew is pointing out to us.
[3380.54 --> 3381.30]  And so we're going to trace
[3381.30 --> 3381.94]  through the passages
[3381.94 --> 3383.10]  and a few others
[3383.10 --> 3385.74]  to see what Christ being king,
[3386.26 --> 3387.14]  prophet, and priest
[3387.14 --> 3388.04]  means to us.
[3388.04 --> 3392.88]  So as I mentioned,
[3392.96 --> 3393.48]  we're going to go through
[3393.48 --> 3394.12]  those passages.
[3394.48 --> 3395.36]  And we're going to start
[3395.36 --> 3397.12]  with him being king.
[3398.32 --> 3399.80]  We see Jesus as king
[3399.80 --> 3400.92]  in the triumphal entry
[3400.92 --> 3401.94]  as we cover
[3401.94 --> 3403.06]  every Easter service
[3403.06 --> 3404.18]  in verses 1 to 11.
[3405.06 --> 3406.38]  These passages start out
[3406.38 --> 3407.26]  with Jesus commanding
[3407.26 --> 3408.10]  two of his disciples
[3408.10 --> 3409.54]  to go to a specific house
[3409.54 --> 3410.44]  and grab a donkey
[3410.44 --> 3411.22]  and it's full
[3411.22 --> 3412.62]  because the Lord
[3412.62 --> 3413.50]  has need of it.
[3414.16 --> 3415.08]  And when he arrives
[3415.08 --> 3416.46]  to ride in Jerusalem,
[3416.46 --> 3417.50]  there is a crowd
[3417.50 --> 3418.24]  that is formed
[3418.24 --> 3419.64]  and people are laying down
[3419.64 --> 3420.94]  their cloaks and branches
[3420.94 --> 3422.62]  for him to ride on.
[3423.36 --> 3424.50]  As Matthew shows,
[3424.64 --> 3426.58]  this fulfills the prophecy
[3426.58 --> 3427.48]  in chapter 9
[3427.48 --> 3428.86]  and verse 9 of Zechariah.
[3429.66 --> 3430.64]  The same prophecy
[3430.64 --> 3431.84]  that states this king
[3431.84 --> 3433.00]  would rule to the ends
[3433.00 --> 3433.52]  of the earth
[3433.52 --> 3434.74]  and bring peace
[3434.74 --> 3435.42]  to the nations
[3435.42 --> 3436.36]  and salvation
[3436.36 --> 3437.20]  and righteousness.
[3438.42 --> 3440.80]  The way Jesus enters Jerusalem
[3440.80 --> 3442.14]  is very similar
[3442.14 --> 3444.28]  to the way conquering emperors
[3444.28 --> 3445.26]  would arrive in a city
[3445.26 --> 3445.96]  when they won.
[3446.46 --> 3447.94]  When they entered,
[3448.10 --> 3448.74]  they would immediately
[3448.74 --> 3449.54]  go to the temple
[3449.54 --> 3450.24]  as stated
[3450.24 --> 3451.90]  because their God
[3451.90 --> 3452.62]  was the reason
[3452.62 --> 3453.68]  that they were successful
[3453.68 --> 3455.02]  and they would desecrate
[3455.02 --> 3455.94]  the sanctuaries
[3455.94 --> 3456.72]  of the God
[3456.72 --> 3457.50]  that the people
[3457.50 --> 3458.18]  that they conquered.
[3459.64 --> 3460.74]  Israel had seen
[3460.74 --> 3461.82]  this happen a lot
[3461.82 --> 3462.68]  in its history.
[3463.54 --> 3464.84]  In 167 BC,
[3465.02 --> 3466.30]  Antiochus Epiphanes
[3466.30 --> 3467.68]  conquered Jerusalem
[3467.68 --> 3469.04]  and sacrificed a pig
[3469.04 --> 3469.66]  on the altar
[3469.66 --> 3470.80]  and raised a banner
[3470.80 --> 3471.42]  to Zeus
[3471.42 --> 3472.60]  in that very temple.
[3472.60 --> 3474.72]  in 63 BC,
[3475.08 --> 3476.60]  General Pompey of Rome
[3476.60 --> 3477.52]  conquered Jerusalem
[3477.52 --> 3478.52]  and entered
[3478.52 --> 3480.02]  the Holy of Holies
[3480.02 --> 3481.40]  where no man
[3481.40 --> 3482.38]  should enter and live
[3482.38 --> 3483.74]  and yet he lived
[3483.74 --> 3484.58]  to tell the tale.
[3486.04 --> 3487.14]  And in 70 AD,
[3487.70 --> 3488.94]  General Titus of Rome
[3488.94 --> 3490.16]  sieged Jerusalem
[3490.16 --> 3491.40]  and destroyed the temple
[3491.40 --> 3492.98]  until this current day.
[3492.98 --> 3495.52]  But those emperors
[3495.52 --> 3496.10]  and generals
[3496.10 --> 3497.34]  would enter
[3497.34 --> 3498.14]  on white horses
[3498.14 --> 3499.04]  with pride
[3499.04 --> 3499.78]  and power
[3499.78 --> 3501.00]  and grandeur.
[3501.90 --> 3502.90]  And Jesus is stated
[3502.90 --> 3503.94]  to enter on a donkey
[3503.94 --> 3505.12]  and is described
[3505.12 --> 3505.70]  as gentle
[3505.70 --> 3506.38]  and humble.
[3507.86 --> 3508.88]  And Jesus doesn't enter
[3508.88 --> 3509.74]  to desecrate
[3509.74 --> 3510.32]  the temple
[3510.32 --> 3512.04]  of his father.
[3512.60 --> 3512.90]  Rather,
[3512.98 --> 3513.82]  he cleanses it.
[3514.46 --> 3515.70]  Or in another way
[3515.70 --> 3516.50]  we can look at it,
[3516.64 --> 3516.96]  the temple
[3516.96 --> 3518.40]  is already desecrated
[3518.40 --> 3518.80]  because,
[3519.06 --> 3519.72]  as we will read,
[3519.72 --> 3520.54]  they're worshipping
[3520.54 --> 3521.32]  something else
[3521.32 --> 3522.26]  in his temple.
[3523.84 --> 3524.70]  They're worshipping
[3524.70 --> 3526.06]  money and legalism
[3526.06 --> 3527.92]  in their merchant system
[3527.92 --> 3529.18]  to supply sacrifices
[3529.18 --> 3529.64]  to people
[3529.64 --> 3530.88]  to satisfy God
[3530.88 --> 3531.96]  by legally obeying
[3531.96 --> 3532.40]  the law
[3532.40 --> 3535.28]  instead of obeying God
[3535.28 --> 3536.36]  in the way he desired
[3536.36 --> 3537.36]  in Micah 6.8.
[3538.06 --> 3538.88]  Seek justice,
[3539.10 --> 3539.62]  love mercy,
[3539.82 --> 3540.50]  and walk humbly
[3540.50 --> 3541.10]  with your God.
[3542.20 --> 3543.26]  We also see him
[3543.26 --> 3543.84]  as king
[3543.84 --> 3544.82]  when he's riding in
[3544.82 --> 3545.40]  and the crowds
[3545.40 --> 3546.78]  are shouting
[3546.78 --> 3547.40]  Hosanna
[3547.40 --> 3548.44]  to the Son of David.
[3548.96 --> 3549.42]  And again,
[3549.48 --> 3549.94]  he's called
[3549.94 --> 3550.98]  Son of David
[3550.98 --> 3551.70]  by the children
[3551.70 --> 3552.64]  quoting the prophetic
[3552.64 --> 3553.24]  Psalms
[3553.24 --> 3554.56]  when he's in the temple
[3554.56 --> 3555.34]  in verse 15.
[3556.30 --> 3557.16]  The Son of David
[3557.16 --> 3558.46]  throughout the Old Testament
[3558.46 --> 3559.54]  in the Psalms
[3559.54 --> 3560.48]  and the prophets
[3560.48 --> 3561.76]  was the son
[3561.76 --> 3562.66]  who would succeed
[3562.66 --> 3563.82]  David as king
[3563.82 --> 3564.82]  and who would have
[3564.82 --> 3565.28]  the kingdom
[3565.28 --> 3566.36]  that would never end.
[3567.36 --> 3568.30]  We see this idea
[3568.30 --> 3569.96]  start by God
[3569.96 --> 3570.64]  in God's covenant
[3570.64 --> 3571.46]  with David
[3571.46 --> 3574.42]  in 2 Samuel 7,
[3574.54 --> 3575.72]  12-16.
[3576.86 --> 3577.98]  The Lord declares
[3577.98 --> 3578.46]  to you
[3578.46 --> 3579.44]  that the Lord himself
[3579.44 --> 3580.06]  will establish
[3580.06 --> 3580.84]  a house for you.
[3581.32 --> 3581.98]  When your days
[3581.98 --> 3582.36]  are over
[3582.36 --> 3582.94]  and you rest
[3582.94 --> 3583.78]  with your ancestors,
[3584.28 --> 3585.06]  I will raise up
[3585.06 --> 3585.56]  your offspring
[3585.56 --> 3586.54]  to succeed you,
[3587.16 --> 3588.28]  your own flesh and blood
[3588.28 --> 3589.08]  and I will establish
[3589.08 --> 3589.58]  his kingdom.
[3590.48 --> 3591.36]  He is the one
[3591.36 --> 3591.82]  who will build
[3591.82 --> 3592.90]  a house for my name
[3592.90 --> 3594.12]  and I will establish
[3594.12 --> 3594.64]  the throne
[3594.64 --> 3595.58]  of his kingdom forever.
[3596.16 --> 3597.32]  I will be his father
[3597.32 --> 3598.60]  and he will be my son.
[3599.38 --> 3600.34]  When he does wrong,
[3600.42 --> 3601.06]  I will punish him
[3601.06 --> 3601.62]  with the rod
[3601.62 --> 3602.54]  wielded by men
[3602.54 --> 3603.56]  and with floggings
[3603.56 --> 3604.86]  afflicted by human hands.
[3604.86 --> 3606.56]  But my love
[3606.56 --> 3607.38]  will never be taken
[3607.38 --> 3608.02]  away from him
[3608.02 --> 3609.42]  as I took it away
[3609.42 --> 3609.90]  from Saul.
[3610.98 --> 3611.66]  When I removed
[3611.66 --> 3612.42]  from before you,
[3612.50 --> 3613.38]  your house and your kingdom
[3613.38 --> 3614.16]  will endure forever
[3614.16 --> 3614.70]  before me
[3614.70 --> 3615.66]  and your throne
[3615.66 --> 3616.42]  will be established
[3616.42 --> 3616.94]  forever.
[3619.02 --> 3619.84]  God stated
[3619.84 --> 3620.56]  that the future
[3620.56 --> 3621.46]  descendants of David
[3621.46 --> 3622.38]  would be king forever
[3622.38 --> 3623.30]  and that he would have
[3623.30 --> 3624.66]  a father-son relationship
[3624.66 --> 3626.32]  with God himself
[3626.32 --> 3628.40]  and that he would be
[3628.40 --> 3629.50]  inflicted by human
[3629.50 --> 3630.16]  punishments
[3630.16 --> 3631.54]  for his sins.
[3632.16 --> 3632.52]  Now,
[3633.04 --> 3633.30]  Jesus
[3633.30 --> 3634.44]  doesn't sin,
[3635.08 --> 3636.46]  but he does
[3636.46 --> 3637.62]  take our sins
[3637.62 --> 3638.38]  and is punished
[3638.38 --> 3640.48]  as if he did.
[3641.98 --> 3643.58]  He took those punishments
[3643.58 --> 3644.66]  from men
[3644.66 --> 3646.38]  and despite that punishment,
[3646.56 --> 3647.12]  God's love
[3647.12 --> 3648.36]  never departed
[3648.36 --> 3648.84]  from him.
[3650.02 --> 3650.62]  This king
[3650.62 --> 3651.52]  is the one
[3651.52 --> 3652.98]  they see in Jesus,
[3653.60 --> 3654.60]  the one that would
[3654.60 --> 3655.50]  end Israel's
[3655.50 --> 3656.62]  constant cycle
[3656.62 --> 3657.48]  of defeats
[3657.48 --> 3659.70]  and bring with him
[3659.70 --> 3660.26]  salvation
[3660.26 --> 3661.06]  and righteousness
[3661.06 --> 3661.88]  and peace.
[3663.30 --> 3664.42]  Jesus is the true
[3664.42 --> 3665.30]  and better king.
[3666.78 --> 3667.22]  Now,
[3667.26 --> 3667.60]  let's look at
[3667.60 --> 3668.52]  Jesus' prophet.
[3669.72 --> 3670.58]  At the beginning,
[3670.94 --> 3671.62]  we see Jesus
[3671.62 --> 3672.66]  in verse 1 to 3
[3672.66 --> 3673.40]  where Jesus tells
[3673.40 --> 3674.34]  the disciples again
[3674.34 --> 3675.76]  to grab the donkey
[3675.76 --> 3676.66]  and the foal
[3676.66 --> 3677.16]  from a man.
[3677.90 --> 3678.78]  He also tells them
[3678.78 --> 3679.64]  that when they say
[3679.64 --> 3680.54]  the Lord needs it,
[3680.86 --> 3681.58]  the owner will give it
[3681.58 --> 3681.84]  to them.
[3683.00 --> 3683.66]  Jesus is able
[3683.66 --> 3684.14]  to tell them
[3684.14 --> 3684.76]  this will occur
[3684.76 --> 3686.40]  because of divine knowledge,
[3687.08 --> 3689.16]  because he is a prophet
[3689.16 --> 3690.26]  and he knows
[3690.26 --> 3690.76]  God's will
[3690.76 --> 3691.32]  for the moment
[3691.32 --> 3692.58]  and that it will happen
[3692.58 --> 3693.86]  according to the prophecy
[3693.86 --> 3695.06]  and God's will.
[3696.00 --> 3696.46]  Again,
[3696.68 --> 3698.04]  like the son of David
[3698.04 --> 3698.46]  comment,
[3698.92 --> 3699.48]  the crowds
[3699.48 --> 3700.00]  at the end
[3700.00 --> 3701.04]  of the triumphal entry
[3701.04 --> 3704.44]  see him
[3704.44 --> 3705.28]  and stir
[3705.28 --> 3705.70]  and ask,
[3705.84 --> 3706.62]  who is this?
[3707.72 --> 3708.96]  And the others answer,
[3709.32 --> 3710.14]  this is Jesus,
[3710.62 --> 3711.26]  the prophet
[3711.26 --> 3712.32]  from Nazareth
[3712.32 --> 3713.08]  in Galilee.
[3714.12 --> 3714.96]  These people
[3714.96 --> 3716.68]  see what he is.
[3716.68 --> 3718.00]  They see him
[3718.00 --> 3718.76]  teach from the law
[3718.76 --> 3719.46]  with authority
[3719.46 --> 3720.62]  the ways
[3720.62 --> 3722.66]  people are befuddled by.
[3723.26 --> 3723.94]  They see him
[3723.94 --> 3724.72]  perform signs
[3724.72 --> 3725.38]  and wonders
[3725.38 --> 3726.32]  just like Moses,
[3726.54 --> 3727.00]  Elijah,
[3727.20 --> 3727.70]  Elisha,
[3728.08 --> 3729.24]  even healing the sick,
[3729.36 --> 3729.70]  the mute,
[3729.80 --> 3730.26]  the blind,
[3730.34 --> 3731.00]  and the crippled.
[3731.64 --> 3732.52]  They see him
[3732.52 --> 3733.22]  as prophet
[3733.22 --> 3734.40]  and know
[3734.40 --> 3735.24]  they are confronted
[3735.24 --> 3735.70]  with him
[3735.70 --> 3736.48]  and now they are
[3736.48 --> 3737.24]  confronted with him
[3737.24 --> 3737.92]  as a king
[3737.92 --> 3739.66]  and they're confused.
[3741.22 --> 3741.96]  Why are they
[3741.96 --> 3742.76]  confused though?
[3743.96 --> 3744.94]  They're confused
[3744.94 --> 3745.62]  because they have
[3745.62 --> 3746.62]  simply never
[3746.62 --> 3747.42]  seen this.
[3748.34 --> 3749.16]  In Israel's past
[3749.16 --> 3749.66]  there have been
[3749.66 --> 3750.60]  prophets who lead
[3750.60 --> 3752.14]  and kings who prophesy
[3752.14 --> 3753.00]  and even prophets
[3753.00 --> 3753.86]  who do priestly work
[3753.86 --> 3755.18]  and priests who prophesy
[3755.18 --> 3756.98]  but there has never
[3756.98 --> 3757.84]  been a king
[3757.84 --> 3758.82]  who was also
[3758.82 --> 3759.46]  a prophet.
[3761.36 --> 3761.62]  Jesus
[3761.62 --> 3762.78]  is undeniably
[3762.78 --> 3763.28]  presented
[3763.28 --> 3764.36]  and witnessed
[3764.36 --> 3765.48]  as both
[3765.48 --> 3766.50]  in this passage
[3766.50 --> 3768.40]  and in John's
[3768.40 --> 3768.90]  account of the
[3768.90 --> 3769.48]  temple cleansing
[3769.48 --> 3770.60]  in chapter 2
[3770.60 --> 3771.56]  13 to 17
[3771.56 --> 3772.58]  Jesus shows
[3772.58 --> 3773.94]  his prophetic work
[3773.94 --> 3775.10]  when he's challenged
[3775.10 --> 3775.64]  by the Jews
[3775.64 --> 3776.58]  to perform a sign
[3776.58 --> 3777.86]  something which
[3777.86 --> 3778.64]  would be required
[3778.64 --> 3779.36]  of an Old Testament
[3779.36 --> 3779.80]  prophet.
[3781.16 --> 3782.34]  The sign that Jesus
[3782.34 --> 3783.12]  offers is the
[3783.12 --> 3784.06]  destruction and the
[3784.06 --> 3784.78]  rebuilding of the
[3784.78 --> 3785.78]  temple in three days.
[3786.58 --> 3787.28]  He means his
[3787.28 --> 3788.06]  actual body
[3788.06 --> 3789.90]  and Jesus
[3789.90 --> 3791.18]  accurately performs
[3791.18 --> 3792.60]  this sign
[3792.60 --> 3794.28]  when he dies
[3794.28 --> 3794.92]  on the cross
[3794.92 --> 3796.16]  and resurrects.
[3797.06 --> 3797.84]  Jesus is the
[3797.84 --> 3798.68]  true and better
[3798.68 --> 3799.10]  prophet.
[3800.46 --> 3800.90]  And finally
[3800.90 --> 3801.46]  let us look
[3801.46 --> 3801.92]  how Jesus
[3801.92 --> 3803.04]  is priest.
[3804.18 --> 3804.78]  The priest
[3804.78 --> 3805.44]  had a very
[3805.44 --> 3807.20]  specific
[3807.20 --> 3808.42]  set of jobs
[3808.42 --> 3810.28]  and we see
[3810.28 --> 3811.20]  Jesus do those
[3811.20 --> 3811.68]  throughout his
[3811.68 --> 3812.08]  ministry.
[3813.64 --> 3814.16]  Priests would be
[3814.16 --> 3815.10]  required to teach
[3815.10 --> 3815.70]  the law to the
[3815.70 --> 3816.52]  people and lead
[3816.52 --> 3816.98]  the community
[3816.98 --> 3817.68]  in praise to
[3817.68 --> 3817.90]  God.
[3818.54 --> 3818.82]  They would
[3818.82 --> 3819.48]  function as a
[3819.48 --> 3820.18]  judicial system
[3820.18 --> 3820.66]  for issues
[3820.66 --> 3821.18]  related to
[3821.18 --> 3821.88]  rituals and
[3821.88 --> 3822.24]  purity.
[3822.72 --> 3823.02]  They would
[3823.02 --> 3823.60]  assess the
[3823.60 --> 3824.12]  sick when it
[3824.12 --> 3824.70]  relates to
[3824.70 --> 3825.38]  ritual purity.
[3825.94 --> 3826.30]  They would
[3826.30 --> 3827.18]  offer sacrifices
[3827.18 --> 3827.76]  on behalf of
[3827.76 --> 3828.46]  the people as
[3828.46 --> 3828.84]  well as the
[3828.84 --> 3829.66]  major sacrifices
[3829.66 --> 3830.20]  for the whole
[3830.20 --> 3831.40]  community and
[3831.40 --> 3831.58]  they would
[3831.58 --> 3832.26]  perform purity
[3832.26 --> 3835.02]  rituals and
[3835.02 --> 3835.76]  cleansing practices
[3835.76 --> 3836.68]  for the temple
[3836.68 --> 3837.42]  and the people.
[3838.64 --> 3839.12]  And Jesus does
[3839.12 --> 3839.70]  all of these.
[3840.46 --> 3841.24]  Not necessarily
[3841.24 --> 3841.94]  in the temple
[3841.94 --> 3843.54]  but as we
[3843.54 --> 3844.34]  established earlier
[3844.34 --> 3845.64]  he is the
[3845.64 --> 3845.90]  temple.
[3846.80 --> 3847.64]  We see Jesus
[3847.64 --> 3848.92]  in this story
[3848.92 --> 3849.60]  throw out the
[3849.60 --> 3850.20]  money changers
[3850.20 --> 3850.74]  and the merchants
[3850.74 --> 3851.54]  to cleanse the
[3851.54 --> 3851.78]  temple.
[3852.36 --> 3853.00]  We see him
[3853.00 --> 3853.80]  teach the law
[3853.80 --> 3854.68]  most famously
[3854.68 --> 3855.52]  in his sermon
[3855.52 --> 3856.02]  on the mount
[3856.02 --> 3856.98]  earlier in Matthew.
[3857.56 --> 3858.30]  We see him
[3858.30 --> 3859.16]  healing the blind
[3859.16 --> 3859.76]  and the lame
[3859.76 --> 3860.90]  in verse 14
[3860.90 --> 3861.82]  and we see
[3861.82 --> 3862.62]  children with
[3862.62 --> 3863.54]  him praise God
[3863.54 --> 3864.24]  in the temple.
[3865.04 --> 3865.66]  We see him
[3865.66 --> 3866.40]  also function
[3866.40 --> 3867.16]  as a judicial
[3867.16 --> 3868.18]  role when the
[3868.18 --> 3868.82]  religious leaders
[3868.82 --> 3870.10]  constantly question
[3870.10 --> 3871.06]  him about the
[3871.06 --> 3872.00]  temple, civil
[3872.00 --> 3873.14]  taxes, Sabbath
[3873.14 --> 3873.88]  laws, and
[3873.88 --> 3874.42]  healings.
[3875.20 --> 3875.92]  And lastly we
[3875.92 --> 3876.42]  see Jesus
[3876.42 --> 3877.02]  offer the
[3877.02 --> 3878.04]  ultimate sacrifice
[3878.04 --> 3878.62]  of atonement
[3878.62 --> 3879.52]  on the cross.
[3880.78 --> 3881.52]  Jesus is the
[3881.52 --> 3882.44]  true and better
[3882.44 --> 3883.06]  priest.
[3884.76 --> 3885.56]  Now this is
[3885.56 --> 3885.90]  where we go
[3885.90 --> 3886.24]  deeper.
[3889.16 --> 3889.80]  And we see
[3889.80 --> 3890.16]  that Jesus
[3890.16 --> 3890.82]  is more
[3890.82 --> 3891.72]  than just
[3891.72 --> 3892.76]  merely a
[3892.76 --> 3892.98]  king.
[3893.70 --> 3894.28]  He's not
[3894.28 --> 3894.96]  even merely
[3894.96 --> 3895.68]  a combination
[3895.68 --> 3896.52]  of these
[3896.52 --> 3897.30]  three offices.
[3898.24 --> 3898.94]  He's not
[3898.94 --> 3899.80]  just a king
[3899.80 --> 3900.56]  and a prophet
[3900.56 --> 3901.38]  and a priest.
[3902.40 --> 3903.32]  Jesus is also
[3903.32 --> 3904.14]  a servant,
[3904.70 --> 3905.28]  the prophecy,
[3905.64 --> 3905.92]  and the
[3905.92 --> 3906.50]  sacrifice.
[3908.02 --> 3908.62]  Jesus is the
[3908.62 --> 3909.28]  sacrifice that
[3909.28 --> 3909.80]  he brings
[3909.80 --> 3910.64]  as priest
[3910.64 --> 3912.78]  to atone
[3912.78 --> 3913.20]  for his
[3913.20 --> 3913.54]  people.
[3914.20 --> 3914.84]  His righteousness
[3914.84 --> 3915.64]  is what saves
[3915.64 --> 3915.84]  us.
[3915.96 --> 3916.54]  He is the
[3916.54 --> 3917.08]  pure and
[3917.08 --> 3917.58]  spotless
[3917.58 --> 3917.92]  lamb.
[3917.92 --> 3919.54]  Jesus is
[3919.54 --> 3920.16]  the prophecy.
[3920.68 --> 3921.26]  He is the
[3921.26 --> 3921.80]  word of God
[3921.80 --> 3922.72]  sent to teach,
[3923.04 --> 3923.40]  warn, and
[3923.40 --> 3924.06]  provide for
[3924.06 --> 3924.56]  his people.
[3925.58 --> 3926.26]  Jesus is
[3926.26 --> 3926.84]  the servant.
[3927.20 --> 3927.72]  He's humble
[3927.72 --> 3928.36]  and gentle,
[3928.84 --> 3929.38]  a carpenter
[3929.38 --> 3929.88]  building a
[3929.88 --> 3930.38]  house for
[3930.38 --> 3931.12]  everyone else,
[3931.66 --> 3932.30]  washing feet
[3932.30 --> 3932.80]  and providing
[3932.80 --> 3933.46]  food for
[3933.46 --> 3933.88]  thousands.
[3935.32 --> 3935.90]  Jesus is not
[3935.90 --> 3936.64]  merely a king.
[3937.38 --> 3938.38]  He's so much
[3938.38 --> 3939.46]  more than we
[3939.46 --> 3940.00]  can imagine.
[3940.00 --> 3943.74]  in our
[3943.74 --> 3944.52]  modern world,
[3944.72 --> 3945.78]  we are filling
[3945.78 --> 3946.58]  a void that
[3946.58 --> 3947.14]  is infinite
[3947.14 --> 3947.90]  with finite
[3947.90 --> 3948.50]  things.
[3949.30 --> 3949.96]  In this
[3949.96 --> 3950.76]  modern world,
[3950.88 --> 3951.98]  identity is a
[3951.98 --> 3952.50]  wild,
[3953.30 --> 3953.68]  panicked
[3953.68 --> 3954.48]  frenzy of
[3954.48 --> 3955.06]  self-made
[3955.06 --> 3955.78]  image and
[3955.78 --> 3956.26]  appearance
[3956.26 --> 3956.82]  crafting,
[3957.30 --> 3957.80]  both in the
[3957.80 --> 3958.50]  material world
[3958.50 --> 3958.90]  and on the
[3958.90 --> 3959.20]  internet.
[3959.96 --> 3960.84]  We shape
[3960.84 --> 3961.38]  and design
[3961.38 --> 3962.36]  every aspect
[3962.36 --> 3963.04]  of who we
[3963.04 --> 3963.32]  are.
[3964.08 --> 3964.52]  And I'm not
[3964.52 --> 3965.28]  just speaking
[3965.28 --> 3965.98]  about appearances,
[3966.42 --> 3967.04]  but how we
[3967.04 --> 3967.78]  talk and are
[3967.78 --> 3968.54]  perceived by
[3968.54 --> 3968.98]  those around
[3968.98 --> 3969.32]  us.
[3969.88 --> 3970.62]  We want
[3970.62 --> 3971.28]  them to see
[3971.28 --> 3971.74]  that we are
[3971.74 --> 3972.42]  a specific
[3972.42 --> 3973.38]  kind of
[3973.38 --> 3973.78]  person.
[3974.60 --> 3975.32]  We're trying
[3975.32 --> 3976.24]  to find hope
[3976.24 --> 3976.96]  in presidents
[3976.96 --> 3977.60]  and prime
[3977.60 --> 3977.96]  ministers,
[3978.50 --> 3979.22]  new leaders
[3979.22 --> 3980.70]  and revolutions
[3980.70 --> 3981.28]  that will
[3981.28 --> 3981.90]  this time,
[3982.40 --> 3983.04]  maybe this
[3983.04 --> 3983.38]  time,
[3983.70 --> 3984.64]  work and
[3984.64 --> 3985.34]  set everything
[3985.34 --> 3985.76]  right,
[3986.54 --> 3987.32]  the way it
[3987.32 --> 3987.90]  should be.
[3989.08 --> 3990.18]  Or we
[3990.18 --> 3991.42]  find no good
[3991.42 --> 3992.18]  in any leader
[3992.18 --> 3992.74]  and find
[3992.74 --> 3993.74]  ourselves opposing
[3993.74 --> 3994.58]  all authority
[3994.58 --> 3995.40]  in our lives,
[3995.94 --> 3996.50]  demanding we
[3996.50 --> 3997.10]  have the final
[3997.10 --> 3997.68]  say over
[3997.68 --> 3998.26]  everything
[3998.26 --> 3998.98]  that happens.
[4000.34 --> 4001.22]  We align
[4001.22 --> 4001.90]  ourselves with
[4001.90 --> 4002.22]  those who
[4002.22 --> 4002.62]  claim to
[4002.62 --> 4003.14]  have secret
[4003.14 --> 4003.90]  knowledge or
[4003.90 --> 4004.70]  hidden paths,
[4005.58 --> 4006.24]  the one who
[4006.24 --> 4007.04]  knows how it
[4007.04 --> 4007.40]  works.
[4008.38 --> 4009.40]  We need the
[4009.40 --> 4010.18]  guidance because
[4010.18 --> 4010.90]  we are so
[4010.90 --> 4012.28]  overwhelmed by
[4012.28 --> 4012.88]  this world
[4012.88 --> 4013.90]  that we live
[4013.90 --> 4014.14]  in.
[4015.08 --> 4016.14]  Or we don't
[4016.14 --> 4016.52]  want to be
[4016.52 --> 4017.14]  left out of
[4017.14 --> 4017.52]  the group
[4017.52 --> 4018.10]  that was
[4018.10 --> 4018.46]  right.
[4019.68 --> 4020.64]  We regiment
[4020.64 --> 4021.46]  every minute
[4021.46 --> 4022.20]  of our lives
[4022.20 --> 4022.90]  with routines,
[4023.20 --> 4023.62]  protocols,
[4023.88 --> 4024.92]  and systems.
[4024.92 --> 4027.12]  But these
[4027.12 --> 4027.66]  leaders are
[4027.66 --> 4028.66]  just kings.
[4029.66 --> 4030.48]  Those people
[4030.48 --> 4031.22]  are just
[4031.22 --> 4032.06]  false prophets.
[4032.72 --> 4033.20]  And those
[4033.20 --> 4034.06]  routines are
[4034.06 --> 4034.78]  just rituals
[4034.78 --> 4035.58]  and sacrifices
[4035.58 --> 4036.12]  that don't
[4036.12 --> 4036.50]  atone.
[4037.56 --> 4038.12]  And in our
[4038.12 --> 4039.02]  sin, we are
[4039.02 --> 4040.06]  supplementing kings
[4040.06 --> 4040.68]  for lesser
[4040.68 --> 4041.10]  princes,
[4041.80 --> 4042.56]  our prophets
[4042.56 --> 4043.62]  for soothsayers,
[4043.88 --> 4044.80]  and our priests
[4044.80 --> 4045.64]  for pagans.
[4046.38 --> 4047.48]  They are simply
[4047.48 --> 4048.40]  those things.
[4049.06 --> 4050.04]  But Christ
[4050.04 --> 4051.20]  is so much
[4051.20 --> 4051.64]  more.
[4051.64 --> 4053.32]  because He
[4053.32 --> 4054.52]  is so much
[4054.52 --> 4055.42]  more, we need
[4055.42 --> 4056.06]  to see what
[4056.06 --> 4056.64]  that means for
[4056.64 --> 4056.98]  us.
[4058.04 --> 4058.66]  Like I said,
[4058.86 --> 4059.54]  all this stuff
[4059.54 --> 4060.08]  about Jesus,
[4060.90 --> 4061.62]  His identity
[4061.62 --> 4062.62]  comes back to
[4062.62 --> 4063.02]  us.
[4064.20 --> 4064.84]  Jesus being
[4064.84 --> 4065.44]  not just
[4065.44 --> 4066.30]  merely a king,
[4066.96 --> 4067.88]  but so much
[4067.88 --> 4070.02]  more means
[4070.02 --> 4070.82]  that we who
[4070.82 --> 4071.76]  are His body
[4071.76 --> 4073.02]  are so much
[4073.02 --> 4073.70]  more than we
[4073.70 --> 4074.28]  can imagine.
[4075.44 --> 4076.30]  As people
[4076.30 --> 4077.08]  who are united
[4077.08 --> 4077.80]  to Christ
[4077.80 --> 4078.74]  by grace
[4078.74 --> 4079.66]  through faith,
[4079.96 --> 4080.98]  we die with
[4080.98 --> 4081.58]  our Christ,
[4081.64 --> 4082.22]  and will be
[4082.22 --> 4082.80]  raised with
[4082.80 --> 4083.92]  Christ.
[4084.22 --> 4084.86]  We are united
[4084.86 --> 4085.44]  to Him and
[4085.44 --> 4086.00]  gain the
[4086.00 --> 4086.38]  righteousness
[4086.38 --> 4087.20]  that is His.
[4088.38 --> 4089.00]  Paul says
[4089.00 --> 4089.70]  in Romans 8,
[4089.76 --> 4090.26]  17,
[4090.84 --> 4091.34]  Now if we
[4091.34 --> 4091.88]  are children,
[4092.20 --> 4092.56]  then we are
[4092.56 --> 4092.96]  heirs,
[4093.22 --> 4094.04]  heirs of God,
[4094.42 --> 4095.08]  and co-heirs
[4095.08 --> 4095.70]  with Christ.
[4096.40 --> 4096.96]  Indeed, we
[4096.96 --> 4097.48]  share in His
[4097.48 --> 4098.20]  sufferings in
[4098.20 --> 4098.62]  order that we
[4098.62 --> 4099.34]  may also share
[4099.34 --> 4100.02]  in His glory.
[4100.74 --> 4101.76]  We share in
[4101.76 --> 4102.42]  the kingship
[4102.42 --> 4103.06]  of Christ,
[4103.48 --> 4103.92]  which means
[4103.92 --> 4104.32]  that we,
[4104.50 --> 4104.78]  like Him,
[4104.90 --> 4105.60]  cannot be like
[4105.60 --> 4106.10]  the kings
[4106.10 --> 4106.90]  of this world
[4106.90 --> 4108.78]  who rule
[4108.78 --> 4109.56]  with grandeur
[4109.56 --> 4110.16]  and pomp
[4110.16 --> 4110.84]  and arrogance.
[4110.84 --> 4112.32]  and pride,
[4113.00 --> 4113.84]  but rather
[4113.84 --> 4114.46]  with humility
[4114.46 --> 4115.50]  and gentleness,
[4116.18 --> 4116.94]  serving others
[4116.94 --> 4117.62]  so that they
[4117.62 --> 4118.20]  may receive
[4118.20 --> 4118.48]  honor.
[4120.16 --> 4121.14]  In 1 Peter 2,
[4121.20 --> 4121.50]  9,
[4121.92 --> 4122.62]  we read,
[4122.62 --> 4123.22]  but you are
[4123.22 --> 4124.02]  a chosen people,
[4124.22 --> 4125.44]  a royal priesthood,
[4125.72 --> 4126.58]  a holy nation,
[4126.74 --> 4127.62]  God's special
[4127.62 --> 4128.10]  possession,
[4128.40 --> 4128.98]  that you may
[4128.98 --> 4129.58]  declare the
[4129.58 --> 4130.32]  praises of Him
[4130.32 --> 4130.92]  who called you
[4130.92 --> 4131.42]  out of darkness
[4131.42 --> 4132.22]  into His wonderful
[4132.22 --> 4132.56]  light.
[4133.78 --> 4134.84]  We are also
[4134.84 --> 4136.10]  priests sharing
[4136.10 --> 4136.80]  in the work
[4136.80 --> 4137.28]  of Christ,
[4137.62 --> 4138.66]  not in the one
[4138.66 --> 4139.66]  perfect sacrifice.
[4140.08 --> 4140.60]  He's completed
[4140.60 --> 4140.96]  that.
[4141.96 --> 4142.68]  But like Him,
[4142.76 --> 4143.50]  we can sacrifice
[4143.50 --> 4144.56]  our very lives
[4144.56 --> 4146.06]  to teach others
[4146.06 --> 4146.72]  the Word of God
[4146.72 --> 4147.38]  and to make sure
[4147.38 --> 4147.98]  His temple,
[4148.46 --> 4148.92]  ourselves,
[4148.92 --> 4150.86]  is holy
[4150.86 --> 4152.52]  and that His
[4152.52 --> 4152.94]  people
[4152.94 --> 4154.28]  and the rest
[4154.28 --> 4154.80]  of the world
[4154.80 --> 4155.48]  can know
[4155.48 --> 4156.10]  how to worship
[4156.10 --> 4156.98]  God properly
[4156.98 --> 4158.48]  and not
[4158.48 --> 4159.26]  with legalism.
[4160.48 --> 4161.22]  And in Acts 2,
[4161.30 --> 4161.76]  38,
[4161.88 --> 4162.34]  Peter says,
[4162.46 --> 4163.46]  repent and be baptized,
[4163.68 --> 4164.30]  every one of you,
[4164.58 --> 4165.74]  in the name of Jesus Christ
[4165.74 --> 4166.32]  for the forgiveness
[4166.32 --> 4167.30]  of your sins
[4167.30 --> 4169.10]  and you will receive
[4169.10 --> 4169.60]  the gift
[4169.60 --> 4170.48]  of the Holy Spirit.
[4171.44 --> 4172.48]  Peter here is preaching
[4172.48 --> 4173.26]  to the crowds
[4173.26 --> 4174.48]  gathered at Pentecost,
[4174.88 --> 4176.04]  watching as the disciples
[4176.04 --> 4177.28]  have the Holy Spirit
[4177.28 --> 4178.10]  fall upon them.
[4179.18 --> 4179.86]  He tells them
[4179.86 --> 4180.54]  that with belief
[4180.54 --> 4181.52]  in Christ,
[4181.74 --> 4182.42]  the Holy Spirit
[4182.42 --> 4183.20]  is received.
[4183.88 --> 4184.88]  The same Spirit
[4184.88 --> 4186.08]  that brought the Word
[4186.08 --> 4186.86]  through Joseph
[4186.86 --> 4187.60]  and Moses
[4187.60 --> 4188.72]  and the minor prophets
[4188.72 --> 4190.24]  and performed signs
[4190.24 --> 4190.88]  and wonders
[4190.88 --> 4191.64]  through Samson,
[4191.86 --> 4192.18]  Elijah,
[4192.38 --> 4193.00]  and Elisha.
[4193.46 --> 4194.84]  That same Spirit
[4194.84 --> 4196.90]  that made those prophets
[4196.90 --> 4197.78]  is in us.
[4199.26 --> 4199.66]  Yes,
[4199.86 --> 4200.98]  we are sons of God
[4200.98 --> 4201.90]  and a nation
[4201.90 --> 4202.44]  of priests
[4202.44 --> 4203.28]  and prophets,
[4203.88 --> 4205.42]  but just like our King,
[4205.42 --> 4206.86]  prophet and priest,
[4207.22 --> 4208.24]  we must also
[4208.24 --> 4209.38]  be servants,
[4209.90 --> 4210.56]  sacrifices,
[4211.64 --> 4212.82]  and in doing so,
[4213.10 --> 4213.88]  we, like Jesus,
[4214.00 --> 4214.78]  will be the fulfillment
[4214.78 --> 4215.98]  of a past prophecy
[4215.98 --> 4217.12]  rising with Him
[4217.12 --> 4218.06]  on the last day.
[4221.26 --> 4222.34]  Our catechism,
[4222.42 --> 4223.20]  the Heidelberg Catechism,
[4223.36 --> 4225.00]  summarizes this neatly as well.
[4225.90 --> 4226.86]  In question and answer,
[4227.22 --> 4227.72]  32,
[4228.62 --> 4229.62]  why are you called
[4229.62 --> 4230.26]  a Christian?
[4230.94 --> 4231.74]  The answer is,
[4231.82 --> 4232.72]  because I am a member
[4232.72 --> 4233.90]  of Christ by faith
[4233.90 --> 4235.38]  and thus share
[4235.38 --> 4236.22]  in His anointing
[4236.22 --> 4237.54]  so that I may,
[4237.76 --> 4238.44]  as prophet,
[4238.82 --> 4239.72]  confess His name,
[4240.48 --> 4241.08]  so that I,
[4241.22 --> 4242.50]  as priest,
[4242.94 --> 4243.86]  present myself,
[4244.28 --> 4245.24]  a living sacrifice
[4245.24 --> 4245.96]  of thanksgiving,
[4246.52 --> 4247.76]  thankfulness to Him,
[4248.18 --> 4248.94]  and as king,
[4249.46 --> 4250.28]  fight with a free
[4250.28 --> 4251.06]  and good conscience
[4251.06 --> 4252.00]  against sin
[4252.00 --> 4252.90]  and the devil
[4252.90 --> 4253.64]  in this life
[4253.64 --> 4254.78]  and the hereafter
[4254.78 --> 4255.40]  reign with Him
[4255.40 --> 4256.86]  eternally over all creatures.
[4256.86 --> 4259.42]  We, as prophets,
[4260.08 --> 4261.04]  confess His name
[4261.04 --> 4262.40]  every time we talk
[4262.40 --> 4262.96]  about Jesus
[4262.96 --> 4264.78]  to those who are not believers.
[4265.62 --> 4267.08]  We confess His name
[4267.08 --> 4268.34]  every time we obey
[4268.34 --> 4269.48]  rather than sin.
[4269.90 --> 4271.02]  We confess His name
[4271.02 --> 4271.76]  to our friends
[4271.76 --> 4272.54]  and families
[4272.54 --> 4273.44]  when we hold
[4273.44 --> 4274.36]  each other accountable.
[4275.16 --> 4276.14]  We confess His name
[4276.14 --> 4277.22]  every time we repent
[4277.22 --> 4278.60]  and with a full heart
[4278.60 --> 4279.32]  for God
[4279.32 --> 4280.86]  and desire to turn to Him.
[4281.54 --> 4282.90]  We, as priests,
[4283.30 --> 4283.96]  present ourselves
[4283.96 --> 4285.22]  as living sacrifices
[4285.22 --> 4286.26]  of thanksgiving to Him
[4286.26 --> 4287.92]  every time we worship Him
[4287.92 --> 4288.76]  and serve each other.
[4289.94 --> 4291.48]  Every act of hospitality,
[4291.76 --> 4293.18]  every prayer for others,
[4293.64 --> 4294.26]  every moment
[4294.26 --> 4295.06]  where we choose
[4295.06 --> 4295.82]  to obey God
[4295.82 --> 4296.70]  rather than sin,
[4297.06 --> 4297.84]  or every time
[4297.84 --> 4298.72]  we read our Bibles
[4298.72 --> 4300.04]  and grow in our understanding
[4300.04 --> 4300.58]  of the Lord,
[4301.86 --> 4303.00]  listening to what He
[4303.00 --> 4304.00]  is teaching to us.
[4304.60 --> 4305.90]  Every time we dedicate
[4305.90 --> 4306.94]  ourselves to live
[4306.94 --> 4308.44]  wholly for Him
[4308.44 --> 4310.16]  and listen to the word preached,
[4310.36 --> 4311.66]  we live as priests.
[4313.38 --> 4314.70]  And we live as kings
[4314.70 --> 4316.30]  who are co-heirs with Christ
[4316.30 --> 4317.56]  when we lead others
[4317.56 --> 4318.58]  into faithfulness
[4318.58 --> 4319.90]  and away from sin.
[4320.30 --> 4321.96]  Every time we defend the weak
[4321.96 --> 4323.14]  and do whatever we do
[4323.14 --> 4324.28]  in our work
[4324.28 --> 4325.32]  for the glory of God,
[4326.16 --> 4327.30]  every act of service
[4327.30 --> 4328.12]  to God's body
[4328.12 --> 4328.84]  and to the world
[4328.84 --> 4330.06]  in which He died for,
[4331.50 --> 4332.80]  we fulfill our tasks
[4332.80 --> 4334.20]  as kings and stewards
[4334.20 --> 4334.96]  of creation
[4334.96 --> 4336.24]  into God's glory.
[4337.30 --> 4338.60]  So do these things.
[4339.28 --> 4340.68]  This is why we are here.
[4341.24 --> 4342.32]  These are His commands.
[4342.32 --> 4345.14]  We are not merely disciples.
[4346.12 --> 4347.02]  We are co-heirs
[4347.02 --> 4348.08]  to Christ's throne,
[4348.60 --> 4349.36]  fellow priests
[4349.36 --> 4350.58]  and minor prophets.
[4351.40 --> 4352.00]  Follow Him
[4352.00 --> 4353.24]  and do His work.
[4357.36 --> 4358.52]  When I was watching
[4358.52 --> 4359.50]  the recent elections
[4359.50 --> 4361.32]  a few couple months ago,
[4362.08 --> 4362.90]  I was disappointed
[4362.90 --> 4364.24]  for a myriad of reasons.
[4364.86 --> 4365.96]  I put my hope
[4365.96 --> 4366.90]  in someone else.
[4367.56 --> 4368.80]  I wanted to determine
[4368.80 --> 4369.32]  the outcome
[4369.32 --> 4370.22]  rather than God.
[4370.22 --> 4371.56]  I got lost
[4371.56 --> 4372.78]  in listening to podcasts.
[4373.18 --> 4374.60]  I spent so much time
[4374.60 --> 4375.42]  letting the voices
[4375.42 --> 4376.00]  on the internet
[4376.00 --> 4376.86]  guide my life
[4376.86 --> 4378.20]  that it gets in the way
[4378.20 --> 4379.70]  of how much I let
[4379.70 --> 4380.78]  and listen to God.
[4381.82 --> 4383.02]  And I'm constantly
[4383.02 --> 4384.04]  trying to fill my head
[4384.04 --> 4384.72]  with information
[4384.72 --> 4386.08]  so that I can live up
[4386.08 --> 4386.54]  to the image
[4386.54 --> 4387.42]  of the smart person
[4387.42 --> 4388.52]  people say I am.
[4390.50 --> 4391.46]  But these things
[4391.46 --> 4392.44]  weigh me down.
[4393.44 --> 4394.36]  And this burden,
[4394.84 --> 4395.42]  His burden,
[4395.96 --> 4397.16]  is so much lighter.
[4397.16 --> 4399.00]  And I've seen
[4399.00 --> 4399.78]  the weight lift
[4399.78 --> 4400.52]  off my shoulders
[4400.52 --> 4401.42]  when I go to Him.
[4401.90 --> 4403.10]  When I trust Him
[4403.10 --> 4404.64]  rather than presidents
[4404.64 --> 4405.78]  and follow Him
[4405.78 --> 4406.62]  rather than some
[4406.62 --> 4407.84]  40-year-old guru
[4407.84 --> 4408.98]  who is selling
[4408.98 --> 4409.86]  some green paste
[4409.86 --> 4410.38]  on the internet.
[4411.56 --> 4413.00]  And when I read His word,
[4413.12 --> 4414.26]  I am amazed
[4414.26 --> 4415.16]  at His wisdom.
[4416.04 --> 4416.82]  How could I,
[4417.28 --> 4418.30]  how could we
[4418.30 --> 4420.66]  ever think
[4420.66 --> 4421.60]  that we could craft
[4421.60 --> 4422.82]  a better image
[4422.82 --> 4423.16]  for ourselves
[4423.68 --> 4425.48]  than He who has said
[4425.48 --> 4426.52]  we're made in His?
[4427.16 --> 4430.48]  But you hear that?
[4431.26 --> 4432.16]  It's Him
[4432.16 --> 4433.14]  who made us
[4433.14 --> 4433.86]  in His image.
[4434.82 --> 4435.72]  We need to stop
[4435.72 --> 4436.58]  crafting ourselves
[4436.58 --> 4437.56]  into false idols
[4437.56 --> 4438.98]  and must remember
[4438.98 --> 4439.68]  that it is because
[4439.68 --> 4440.46]  of our unity
[4440.46 --> 4441.44]  with Christ
[4441.44 --> 4443.04]  which He died for.
[4444.40 --> 4445.36]  Through that unity
[4445.36 --> 4446.50]  He has made us
[4446.50 --> 4447.20]  so much more
[4447.20 --> 4448.34]  than we can imagine.
[4449.56 --> 4450.82]  And with our unity
[4450.82 --> 4451.96]  must come humility
[4451.96 --> 4453.26]  and gentleness
[4453.26 --> 4454.16]  that is found
[4454.16 --> 4454.90]  in our Creator.
[4454.90 --> 4458.68]  Jesus is so much more
[4458.68 --> 4459.62]  than we can imagine.
[4460.66 --> 4461.84]  He is God after all.
[4462.68 --> 4463.46]  And because of that
[4463.46 --> 4464.46]  we can do nothing
[4464.46 --> 4465.86]  but behold our King.
[4466.48 --> 4467.68]  He's so much more.
[4468.84 --> 4469.48]  Let's pray.
[4472.90 --> 4473.68]  Dear Lord,
[4474.10 --> 4475.76]  thank You for who You are.
[4476.70 --> 4477.92]  Open our minds.
[4478.98 --> 4480.44]  Continue to show us
