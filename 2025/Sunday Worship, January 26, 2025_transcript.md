[0.00 --> 2.12]  Who we made you to be
[2.12 --> 5.00]  And live like you're loved
[5.00 --> 9.18]  Live like you're loved
[10.26 --> 12.26]  Live like you're loved
[12.26 --> 17.26]  Live like you're loved
[18.26 --> 20.12]  Live like you're loved
[20.12 --> 22.14]  Walk like you're free
[22.14 --> 23.94]  Stay like you know
[23.94 --> 26.08]  Who we made you to be
[26.08 --> 28.10]  Live like you're loved
[28.10 --> 29.90]  Like you're alive
[29.90 --> 34.12]  His love is all that you'll ever need
[34.12 --> 37.28]  So go ahead and live like you're left
[37.28 --> 45.32]  His love has made you more than enough
[45.32 --> 53.28]  So go ahead and live like you're left
[53.28 --> 57.92]  It's okay to act like you've been set free
[57.92 --> 61.62]  His love has made you more than enough
[61.62 --> 66.14]  So go ahead and be who he made you to be
[66.14 --> 68.02]  And live like you're left
[68.02 --> 72.10]  Live like you're left
[72.10 --> 76.08]  Live like you're left
[76.08 --> 80.24]  Live like you're left
[80.24 --> 84.16]  Live like you're left
[84.16 --> 86.08]  Walk like you're free
[86.08 --> 90.10]  Stare like you know who he made you to be
[90.10 --> 92.22]  Live like you're left
[92.22 --> 94.18]  Like you believe
[94.18 --> 98.14]  His love is all that you'll ever need
[98.14 --> 100.08]  Live like you're left
[100.08 --> 110.04]  When you're at the end of the road
[110.04 --> 114.14]  And it's not the one that you would have chosen
[114.14 --> 118.20]  When you're at the end of the road
[118.20 --> 120.28]  When you're at the end of the road
[120.28 --> 122.20]  When you're at the end of the road
[122.20 --> 126.20]  And it's not the one that you would have chosen
[126.20 --> 128.20]  When you're at the end of your road
[128.20 --> 130.20]  And you're holding on
[130.20 --> 132.20]  But feel like you're falling
[132.20 --> 134.20]  With every option exhausted
[134.20 --> 142.16]  You tried everything you know
[142.16 --> 146.16]  You saw light then you lost it
[146.16 --> 149.20]  But there is still hope
[149.20 --> 153.20]  Like the fire in the night
[153.20 --> 157.20]  Like the ocean parted wide
[157.20 --> 161.20]  Like the grave empty inside
[161.20 --> 163.20]  You will see
[163.20 --> 165.20]  He still does
[165.20 --> 167.20]  You will see
[167.20 --> 168.20]  Miracles
[168.20 --> 169.20]  Miracles
[169.20 --> 170.20]  Miracles
[170.20 --> 171.20]  Miracles
[171.20 --> 173.20]  Miracles
[173.20 --> 177.20]  Even if you don't see it now
[177.20 --> 179.20]  Without a doubt
[179.20 --> 181.20]  He's already moving
[181.20 --> 183.20]  There's not a pain that you hold
[183.20 --> 185.20]  He doesn't know
[185.20 --> 186.20]  He doesn't know
[186.20 --> 189.20]  And he isn't using
[189.20 --> 192.20]  With every option exhausted
[192.20 --> 196.20]  You tried everything you know
[196.20 --> 199.20]  So reach for something beyond it
[199.20 --> 202.20]  Cause he is our hope
[202.20 --> 206.20]  Like the fire in the night
[206.20 --> 209.20]  Like the ocean parted wide
[209.20 --> 211.20]  Like the grave empty inside
[211.20 --> 213.20]  You will see
[213.20 --> 215.20]  He still does
[215.20 --> 217.20]  Miracles
[217.20 --> 219.20]  Miracles
[219.20 --> 221.20]  Miracles
[221.20 --> 223.20]  Miracles
[223.20 --> 225.20]  Miracles
[225.20 --> 227.20]  Miracles
[227.20 --> 229.20]  Miracles
[229.20 --> 231.20]  Miracles
[231.20 --> 233.20]  Miracles
[233.20 --> 235.20]  Miracles
[235.20 --> 237.20]  Miracles
[237.20 --> 239.20]  A broken heart can be restored
[239.20 --> 241.20]  A broken soul can be reborn
[241.20 --> 242.20]  A broken soul can be reborn
[242.20 --> 243.20]  A broken soul can be reborn
[243.20 --> 244.20]  A broken soul can be reborn
[245.20 --> 248.20]  And greater things are still in store
[248.20 --> 249.20]  For us
[249.20 --> 250.20]  For us
[250.20 --> 257.20]  Like the fire in the night
[257.20 --> 261.20]  Like the ocean parted wide
[261.20 --> 264.20]  Like the grave empty inside
[264.20 --> 267.20]  You will see
[267.20 --> 274.20]  He still does miracles
[274.20 --> 284.20]  He still does
[284.20 --> 289.20]  You're the broken dead dream
[289.20 --> 293.20]  More than you ever see
[293.20 --> 298.20]  Destin-a, destin-a
[298.20 --> 302.20]  Miracles
[323.20 --> 332.20]  I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I'm not enough
[332.20 --> 341.20]  Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
[341.20 --> 347.20]  Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
[347.20 --> 356.20]  Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
[356.20 --> 362.20]  Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low
[362.20 --> 371.20]  Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low
[374.20 --> 383.20]  Remind me once again just who I am because I need to know
[383.20 --> 386.20]  Ooh, oh
[386.20 --> 392.20]  You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
[392.20 --> 398.20]  You say I am strong when I think I am weak
[398.20 --> 404.20]  And you say I am held when I am falling short
[405.20 --> 411.20]  And when I don't belong, oh, you say I am yours
[412.20 --> 414.20]  And I believe
[414.20 --> 415.20]  I
[415.20 --> 417.20]  Oh, I believe
[417.20 --> 418.20]  I
[418.20 --> 419.20]  I
[419.20 --> 421.20]  What you say of me
[421.20 --> 422.20]  I
[422.20 --> 423.20]  I
[423.20 --> 424.20]  I believe
[424.20 --> 431.20]  The only thing that matters now is everything you think of me
[431.20 --> 434.20]  You
[434.20 --> 435.20]  And
[435.20 --> 442.20]  You
[442.20 --> 443.20]  You
[443.20 --> 444.20]  I
[444.20 --> 445.20]  You
[445.20 --> 446.20]  You
[446.20 --> 447.20]  I
[447.20 --> 448.20]  I
[448.20 --> 449.20]  You
[449.20 --> 450.20]  I
[450.20 --> 451.20]  I
[451.20 --> 452.20]  I
[452.20 --> 454.20]  I
[454.20 --> 455.20]  My
[455.20 --> 456.20]  I
[456.20 --> 457.20]  I
[457.20 --> 458.20]  I
[458.20 --> 463.20]  You say I am strong when I think I am weak.
[464.20 --> 469.20]  And you say I am held when I am falling short.
[470.20 --> 473.20]  When I don't belong.
[474.20 --> 476.20]  Oh, you say I am yours.
[477.20 --> 486.20]  And I believe, oh, I believe what you say of me.
[486.20 --> 489.20]  Oh, I believe.
[494.20 --> 503.20]  Taking all I have and now I'm laying it at your feet.
[507.20 --> 514.20]  You'll have every failure, God. You'll have every victory.
[516.20 --> 524.20]  Oh, you say I am loved when I can't feel a thing.
[525.20 --> 531.20]  You say I am strong when I think I am weak.
[532.20 --> 537.20]  You say I am held when I am falling short.
[537.20 --> 541.20]  You say I am good when I don't belong.
[541.20 --> 544.20]  Oh, you say I am yours.
[545.20 --> 547.20]  And I believe.
[547.20 --> 550.20]  Good morning.
[553.20 --> 555.20]  Welcome to church this morning.
[555.20 --> 559.20]  A special welcome if you are a guest here.
[560.20 --> 562.20]  We are really grateful to have you here with us.
[562.20 --> 563.20]  My name is Chris.
[563.20 --> 565.20]  I am one of the pastors here at Emanuel.
[565.20 --> 572.20]  And it's my privilege to lead in our shared worship this morning along with these others that you see on stage.
[572.20 --> 575.20]  Before we begin this morning, we've got a couple of announcements to make.
[575.20 --> 578.20]  And so I'm going to invite Brandon up to the front.
[578.20 --> 580.20]  He's going to make one for Mexico Mission.
[581.20 --> 592.20]  And while he's on his way up, just want to remind you that after worship today, we are sticking around and everyone is invited to soup fellowship lunch.
[592.20 --> 594.20]  And so that's going to happen here.
[594.20 --> 604.20]  And so at some point as we are transitioning from coffee to soup, it would be really grateful if these two sections of chairs could be just cleaned up and kind of pushed to the side.
[604.20 --> 607.20]  And that way we could put tables out here for people to sit at.
[607.20 --> 609.20]  But we think this will be enough.
[610.20 --> 614.20]  And so the reconstruction after will be easy if we limit ourselves to here.
[614.20 --> 618.20]  So anyways, please stick around for that following our worship today.
[618.20 --> 619.20]  Soup and some buns and the like.
[619.20 --> 620.20]  Brandon, go ahead.
[620.20 --> 624.20]  So yeah, just an announcement again for the Mexico dinner.
[624.20 --> 627.20]  Sign up went out, I believe it was yesterday for the e-sign up.
[627.20 --> 630.20]  We'll have a paper sign up at the back desk there as well.
[630.20 --> 634.20]  Cost is $30 for an adult, $15 for a kid 12 and under.
[634.20 --> 637.20]  Even though now I have my own kids, I realize they eat more than adults.
[637.20 --> 639.20]  Probably should charge double.
[639.20 --> 642.20]  Beyond that, doors open at 5.30.
[642.20 --> 647.20]  There will be dessert auction as well as a mystery auction that I think you guys will like as well.
[647.20 --> 651.20]  And then we also knew this year we kind of want to just go over is childcare.
[651.20 --> 652.20]  We are going to offer childcare.
[652.20 --> 655.20]  I know a lot of you guys have to get babysitters to come.
[655.20 --> 660.20]  Instead of paying your babysitter, just you can pay us, which would be great.
[660.20 --> 661.20]  There's a couple caveats of that.
[661.20 --> 665.20]  So it will be operating off kind of like nursery rules like diapers, things like that.
[665.20 --> 666.20]  We won't do.
[666.20 --> 667.20]  We'll come get you guys for.
[667.20 --> 672.20]  The other thing is, again, having my own kids and friends with kids realizing everybody eats something different.
[672.20 --> 679.20]  If your kid is not going to eat the dinner itself and you would like them to eat something else, you must bring that.
[679.20 --> 684.20]  We're not going to make a separate meal for little kids like this and stuff like that.
[684.20 --> 686.20]  We will feed it to them if you like.
[686.20 --> 691.20]  Again, we would take no responsibility if they end up with more of the dinner on them than they ate.
[691.20 --> 694.20]  But that is, we will take care of that if you do bring that dinner.
[694.20 --> 697.20]  If not, they're free to come in here and eat dinner with you guys and then you're sick of them after that.
[697.20 --> 700.20]  You can send them to us, whatever you kind of like.
[700.20 --> 702.20]  And there's no age limit on it.
[702.20 --> 705.20]  So if you want to get rid of your 21-year-old kid, we'll take them as well.
[705.20 --> 708.20]  So yeah, that's about it for that.
[708.20 --> 712.20]  And the last thing is just we also have the Neufelds fundraiser starting the week after.
[712.20 --> 717.20]  So for all you guys that hoard a whole lot of chicken, stuff like that, wait to buy that, buy it from us.
[717.20 --> 720.20]  Neufelds is great prices, helps the kids, helps the trip.
[720.20 --> 724.20]  Especially this year, we kind of want to emphasize, unfortunately, the dollar sucks.
[724.20 --> 726.20]  I think it's like a 10-year low.
[726.20 --> 728.20]  It means this trip is going to be really expensive this year.
[728.20 --> 734.20]  We kind of got to put fundraising efforts on the double, just even for the general pot for what we're doing down there.
[734.20 --> 737.20]  So definitely come out for the dinner.
[737.20 --> 738.20]  It's going to be a great time.
[738.20 --> 739.20]  It's going to be a great auction.
[739.20 --> 742.20]  Someone's going to come home with a beautiful prize that you're going to love.
[742.20 --> 745.20]  And the Neufelds is great for just your everyday food.
[745.20 --> 747.20]  So keep an eye on that.
[747.20 --> 750.20]  Those will all be sent out in emails and things like that as well.
[750.20 --> 754.20]  And then kids will be contacting you and bugging you nonstop for it.
[754.20 --> 756.20]  So yeah, that's it.
[756.20 --> 758.20]  Thanks, Brandon.
[758.20 --> 765.20]  Also following worship today, not only will Brandon be at the back with the sign up for Mexico,
[765.20 --> 772.20]  but Kevin will be at the back to help you with the membership project that's going on.
[772.20 --> 774.20]  And so you may have heard from the office.
[774.20 --> 782.20]  We've been trying to consolidate our various databases and clarify some internal systems.
[782.20 --> 788.20]  Anyway, to do that and facilitate that, we've created this membership survey just to gather some information.
[788.20 --> 795.20]  Kevin will be at the back desk or at the connect booth back there to help you through that if you need assistance with that.
[795.20 --> 798.20]  There's also some QR codes back there that you can just scan with your phone.
[798.20 --> 800.20]  It'll take you right to the form.
[800.20 --> 803.20]  But if you need help with that, Kevin will be there.
[803.20 --> 811.20]  HCBC and Adult Education Heidelberg Catechism Reading Group are after lunch today.
[811.20 --> 814.20]  And so we're going to roll straight into that.
[814.20 --> 820.20]  Next Saturday is our chance to lead worship at Sunridge Gardens up the hill.
[820.20 --> 822.20]  And so that's 2 p.m. on Saturday.
[822.20 --> 824.20]  If you want to join, you're invited to join.
[824.20 --> 827.20]  You can talk to me for details on that.
[827.20 --> 830.20]  And then lastly, February 22nd.
[830.20 --> 835.20]  Now, I know that's a while off yet, but that's the coldest night of the year walk.
[835.20 --> 839.20]  And so a number of us have participated in this in the past.
[839.20 --> 842.20]  This is an excellent opportunity for young families.
[842.20 --> 845.20]  There's a 2-kilometer and a 5-kilometer walk.
[845.20 --> 851.20]  We start at Gateway of Hope over on the bypass and just kind of walk through the downtown neighborhood
[851.20 --> 855.20]  and come back to Gateway of Hope and have dinner with a group of people there.
[855.20 --> 858.20]  We will be putting a team together for that again.
[858.20 --> 861.20]  And so you can join the team or you can sponsor the team.
[861.20 --> 863.20]  We would love to have you participate.
[863.20 --> 867.20]  Details for that will be in the midweek memo as we go into this week as well.
[867.20 --> 870.20]  As far as announcements go, I think that's it.
[870.20 --> 877.20]  So I'm going to invite you to stand as you're able as we are gathered together in the presence of our good God.
[877.20 --> 889.20]  We gather in God's presence and so we receive his greeting and then we pass that greeting on to those around us.
[889.20 --> 895.20]  And so after I give you God's greeting, I invite you to turn to those around you and extend that greeting to them
[895.20 --> 900.20]  by passing the peace of Christ or by saying the Lord be with you as we gather in worship together.
[900.20 --> 902.20]  Receive the greeting of our God.
[902.20 --> 911.20]  Grace, mercy, peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, Son and our Savior,
[911.20 --> 914.20]  through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[914.20 --> 916.20]  Amen.
[919.20 --> 920.20]  Amen.
[949.20 --> 968.20]  Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 24, verses 7 through 10.
[968.20 --> 969.20]  The Lord is the Lord Almighty.
[969.20 --> 971.20]  Lift up your heads, you gates.
[971.20 --> 976.20]  Be lifted up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in.
[976.20 --> 978.20]  Who is the King of glory?
[978.20 --> 982.20]  The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.
[982.20 --> 984.20]  Lift up your heads, you gates.
[984.20 --> 989.20]  Lift them up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in.
[989.20 --> 991.20]  Who is this King of glory?
[991.20 --> 993.20]  The Lord Almighty.
[993.20 --> 995.20]  He is the King of glory.
[995.20 --> 996.20]  The King of glory.
[996.20 --> 1002.20]  The King of glory.
[1002.20 --> 1005.20]  The King of glory.
[1005.20 --> 1007.20]  My work.
[1007.20 --> 1008.20]  Why, Father seen Him dull.
[1008.20 --> 1011.20]  The King of glory it that He has made some joy.
[1011.20 --> 1012.20]  Why, Father O Es Bit.
[1012.20 --> 1013.20]  While those who Johns could worship Him.
[1013.20 --> 1014.20]  The King of glory.
[1014.20 --> 1016.20]  The King of glory.
[1016.20 --> 1019.20]  weather like my world.
[1019.20 --> 1020.20]  Yeah.
[1020.20 --> 1023.20]  The King of glory, the King of glory.
[1023.20 --> 1034.30]  There's a melody of ceaseless praise, as you wait, just the moon is all the good and stronger.
[1037.18 --> 1045.30]  There's a throne beneath the name of names, there is seated on it one who reigns,
[1045.30 --> 1052.80]  and His kingdom now is here and getting closer.
[1056.46 --> 1070.64]  Praise Him like we're there in glory, here and now He's just as holy, Jesus, He's so worthy of it all.
[1070.64 --> 1082.84]  He exists in everlasting light, so on heaven's streets there is no night.
[1083.38 --> 1089.88]  Every tear is wiped away, we'll know no sorrow.
[1089.88 --> 1100.88]  Worship Him with joyful sound, sing until your voice gives out.
[1101.72 --> 1107.88]  No matter where, or who's around, release your worship.
[1107.88 --> 1125.88]  Praise Him like we're there in glory, here and now He's just as holy, Jesus, He's so worthy of it all.
[1125.88 --> 1144.76]  Bring your song, He loves to hear it, bring Him every prayer so clear it, Jesus, He's so worthy of it all.
[1144.76 --> 1156.76]  The one who was, the one who is, the one who is to come.
[1156.76 --> 1175.76]  The one who was, the one who is, the one who is to come.
[1175.76 --> 1184.76]  The one who was, the one who is to come.
[1185.76 --> 1199.76]  Praise Him like we're there in glory, here and now He's just as holy, Jesus, He's so worthy of it all.
[1199.76 --> 1229.74]  The one who was, the one who is, the one who is to come.
[1229.74 --> 1239.74]  The one who was, the one who is, the one who is to come.
[1239.74 --> 1246.74]  The one who was, the one who was, the one who is to come.
[1246.74 --> 1258.74]  The one who was, the one who was, the one who was to come.
[1258.74 --> 1263.74]  The one who is, the one who is to come.
[1263.74 --> 1267.74]  The one who was, the one who was to come.
[1267.74 --> 1268.74]  The one who was, the one who is to come.
[1268.74 --> 1270.74]  Amen.
[1298.74 --> 1300.74]  Amen.
[1328.74 --> 1330.74]  Amen.
[1358.74 --> 1360.74]  Amen.
[1388.74 --> 1389.74]  Amen.
[1418.74 --> 1420.74]  Amen.
[1448.74 --> 1450.74]  Amen.
[1450.74 --> 1452.74]  Amen.
[1452.74 --> 1454.74]  Amen.
[1454.74 --> 1456.74]  Amen.
[1456.74 --> 1458.74]  Amen.
[1458.74 --> 1460.74]  Amen.
[1460.74 --> 1462.74]  Amen.
[1462.74 --> 1464.74]  Amen.
[1464.74 --> 1470.74]  Who else could rescue me from my failing?
[1470.74 --> 1476.74]  Who else would offer his only son?
[1476.74 --> 1482.74]  Who else invites me to call him Father?
[1482.74 --> 1486.74]  Only a holy God.
[1486.74 --> 1492.74]  Only my holy God.
[1492.74 --> 1501.74]  Come and behold him, the one and the only.
[1501.74 --> 1509.74]  Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[1509.74 --> 1513.74]  And worship the holy God.
[1513.74 --> 1523.74]  Come and behold him, the one and the only.
[1523.74 --> 1531.74]  Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[1531.74 --> 1535.74]  Come and worship the holy God.
[1535.74 --> 1537.74]  Amen.
[1537.74 --> 1547.74]  You may have a seat.
[1547.74 --> 1553.74]  Pastor Chris will be preaching on transformation this morning.
[1553.74 --> 1565.74]  And while reflecting on that this week as I worked through planning this service, I wondered what hinders us from being fully transformed as believers.
[1565.74 --> 1571.74]  What holds us back from truly living in the abundant life that he has for us?
[1571.74 --> 1575.74]  For some of us, it might be guilt.
[1575.74 --> 1576.74]  For some it might be shame.
[1576.74 --> 1579.74]  It might be addiction, selfishness.
[1579.74 --> 1583.74]  For me, I've come to realize that it's fear.
[1583.74 --> 1596.74]  Three weeks after Eric and I got married, we tragically lost a dear friend of ours, Kirk, who was the best man in our wedding.
[1596.74 --> 1602.74]  And many of you here remember that loss and we all grieved together.
[1602.74 --> 1609.74]  It was an incredibly difficult time and one that knocked us off our feet.
[1609.74 --> 1611.74]  And we asked God why.
[1611.74 --> 1615.74]  And it really tested us as a recently married couple.
[1615.74 --> 1618.74]  And it was an even truer test of our faith.
[1618.74 --> 1629.74]  But I've realized that experiencing these types of unexpected circumstances over the years has caused me to live in the fear of bad news.
[1629.74 --> 1638.74]  I still have moments of feeling paralyzed by fear and the lack of control over what will happen in my life or in the lives of those I love.
[1638.74 --> 1644.74]  And I often think about these things and how life has been relatively good these last number of years.
[1644.74 --> 1650.74]  And so I almost expect a sudden loss or a heartache to come our way again.
[1650.74 --> 1655.74]  But living in fear is not what God desires for us.
[1655.74 --> 1665.74]  Nor does he want any of us to be stuck in guilt or shame or anxiety or selfishness, whatever that is for you.
[1665.74 --> 1673.74]  God calls us to trust in his unfailing love as the Psalms remind us again and again.
[1673.74 --> 1678.74]  And this is when transformation can begin.
[1678.74 --> 1686.74]  So please stand with us as we confess this together by singing the song, Lord Have Mercy.
[1686.74 --> 1707.74]  Let's pray.
[1707.74 --> 1716.24]  Jesus, I've forgotten the words that you have spoken.
[1717.54 --> 1723.76]  Promises that burn within my heart of Calvary.
[1723.76 --> 1733.60]  With a doubting heart I follow the paths of earthly wisdom.
[1733.60 --> 1742.94]  Give me for my unbelief, renew the fire again.
[1744.94 --> 1752.72]  Lord, have mercy, Christ have mercy.
[1752.72 --> 1760.72]  Lord, have mercy on Thee.
[1760.72 --> 1769.06]  Lord, have mercy, Christ have mercy.
[1769.06 --> 1777.50]  Lord, have mercy on Thee.
[1777.50 --> 1787.84]  I have built an altar where I worship things of them.
[1787.84 --> 1795.90]  I have taken journeys that have drawn me far from You.
[1797.18 --> 1804.56]  Now I am returning to Your mercies ever-flowing.
[1805.92 --> 1812.84]  Pardon my transgressions, help me love You again.
[1812.84 --> 1822.18]  Lord, have mercy, Christ have mercy.
[1822.18 --> 1830.52]  Lord, have mercy on Thee.
[1830.52 --> 1839.10]  Lord, have mercy, Christ have mercy.
[1839.10 --> 1846.74]  Lord, have mercy on Thee.
[1846.74 --> 1853.08]  I have longed to know You.
[1853.08 --> 1865.02]  And all Your tender mercies, like a river of forgiveness, ever flowing without end.
[1865.02 --> 1869.36]  So I bow my heart before You.
[1869.36 --> 1873.36]  In the goodness of Your presence.
[1873.36 --> 1881.70]  The grace of grace, the grace forever shining, like a beacon in the night.
[1881.70 --> 1888.04]  Lord, have mercy on Thee.
[1888.04 --> 1890.04]  Lord, have mercy on Thee.
[1890.04 --> 1896.04]  Lord, have mercy on Thee.
[1896.04 --> 1904.38]  Lord, have mercy on Thee.
[1904.38 --> 1908.38]  Lord, have mercy on Thee.
[1908.38 --> 1916.46]  Lord, have mercy on Thee.
[1916.46 --> 1928.80]  Lord, have mercy on Thee.
[1928.80 --> 1938.14]  Lord, have mercy on Thee.
[1938.14 --> 1943.14]  Lord, have mercy on Thee.
[1943.14 --> 1951.22]  Lord, have mercy on Thee.
[1951.22 --> 1954.56]  Lord, have mercy on Thee.
[1954.56 --> 1960.52]  Our assurance this morning comes from Romans 8, 35 to 39, which is the passage that Pastor
[1960.52 --> 1963.50]  Ed at the time preached at Kirk's funeral.
[1963.50 --> 1966.28]  And so we can find comfort and assurance in these words.
[1967.64 --> 1971.38]  Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[1971.88 --> 1977.10]  Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?
[1977.10 --> 1982.00]  Lord, as it is written, for Your sake we face death all day long.
[1982.00 --> 1985.00]  We are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.
[1985.00 --> 1989.88]  Knowing all these things, we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.
[1989.88 --> 1994.72]  For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the
[1994.72 --> 2000.22]  present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in creation
[2000.22 --> 2007.30]  will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[2007.30 --> 2011.88]  with His word.
[2011.90 --> 2024.64]  myślę
[2028.52 --> 2030.96]  Your word of hepatitis
[2030.96 --> 2037.78]  The mighty rock on which we build
[2037.78 --> 2042.96]  In every line that truth is found
[2042.96 --> 2048.96]  And every page with glory filled
[2048.96 --> 2055.82]  Through faith alone we come to you
[2055.82 --> 2061.34]  We have no merit we can claim
[2061.34 --> 2066.56]  Sure that your promises are true
[2066.56 --> 2072.12]  We place our hope in Jesus' name
[2072.12 --> 2076.18]  Gloria, Gloria
[2076.18 --> 2082.12]  Glory to God alone
[2082.12 --> 2086.50]  Gloria, Gloria
[2086.50 --> 2092.44]  Glory to God alone
[2092.44 --> 2104.92]  In Christ alone we're justified
[2104.92 --> 2110.46]  His righteousness is all our plea
[2110.46 --> 2115.98]  Your lofty lands are satisfied
[2115.98 --> 2120.84]  His perfect word has set us free
[2120.84 --> 2125.48]  Gloria, Gloria
[2125.48 --> 2130.84]  Glory to God alone
[2130.84 --> 2136.24]  Gloria, Gloria
[2136.24 --> 2141.22]  Glory to God alone
[2141.22 --> 2155.08]  By grace alone we have been saved
[2155.08 --> 2160.20]  All that we are has come from you
[2160.20 --> 2165.92]  Hearts that were once by sin enslaved
[2165.92 --> 2170.86]  Now by your power have been anew
[2170.86 --> 2180.86]  Gloria, Gloria, glory to God alone
[2180.86 --> 2190.86]  Gloria, Gloria, glory to God alone
[2190.86 --> 2200.86]  Gloria, Gloria, glory to God alone
[2200.86 --> 2212.86]  Gloria, Gloria, glory to God alone
[2212.86 --> 2237.26]  Good morning, everyone.
[2237.26 --> 2241.26]  My name is Allison and I am one of the deacons here at the church.
[2241.26 --> 2247.26]  This morning's special offering is for Gateway
[2247.26 --> 2250.26]  just down the road and it was mentioned earlier today.
[2250.26 --> 2254.26]  So it would be a great opportunity to check out what it's all about
[2254.26 --> 2262.26]  to actually be part of the dinner that's going on after coldest night of the year.
[2262.26 --> 2266.26]  They also do scheduled tours if you're interested in finding out more
[2266.26 --> 2274.26]  about the many, many, many people and the things that they do for people who are on the street,
[2274.26 --> 2279.26]  who need food, who need shelter, and general help.
[2279.26 --> 2283.26]  They do an awful lot in our community for some very precious people.
[2283.26 --> 2288.26]  So that is what we're supporting this morning.
[2288.26 --> 2290.26]  There are many ways to give.
[2290.26 --> 2297.26]  Check, cash, check out our website for electronic ways to give as well.
[2297.26 --> 2298.26]  Thank you.
[2298.26 --> 2299.26]  Thank you.
[2299.26 --> 2304.26]  Thank you.
[2304.26 --> 2324.26]  Thank you.
[2324.26 --> 2334.64]  He is able, He will never fail, He is almighty God.
[2335.64 --> 2346.26]  Greater than all we see, greater than all we ask, He has done great things.
[2346.26 --> 2357.96]  Lifted up, He defeated the grave, Raised to life, our God is able.
[2359.06 --> 2369.84]  In His name we overcome, For our Lord, our God is able.
[2376.26 --> 2393.74]  God is with us, God is on our side, He will make the way.
[2393.74 --> 2405.74]  For above all we know, For above all we hope, He has done great things.
[2406.68 --> 2416.74]  Lifted up, He defeated the grave, Raised to life, our God is able.
[2416.74 --> 2428.74]  In His name we overcome, For the Lord, our God is able.
[2428.74 --> 2446.74]  For the Lord, our God is with us, He will go before.
[2446.74 --> 2452.78]  He will never leave us, He will never leave us.
[2453.00 --> 2460.74]  God is for us, He has opened us, He will never fail us.
[2461.58 --> 2465.96]  He will never fail us, He lifted up.
[2466.74 --> 2475.16]  He defeated the grave, Raised to life, our God is able.
[2475.16 --> 2505.14]  In His name we overcome.
[2505.14 --> 2509.50]  For the Lord, our God is able.
[2509.50 --> 2515.22]  For the Lord, our God is able.
[2515.22 --> 2521.04]  For the Lord, our God is able.
[2521.04 --> 2535.62]  All right.
[2535.68 --> 2539.80]  I would love to invite all of the kids to come down and join me up here at the front
[2539.80 --> 2541.68]  before we head off into children's worship time.
[2541.68 --> 2543.86]  So come on forward.
[2543.86 --> 2543.92]  Here everyone comes.
[2543.92 --> 2555.76]  Here everyone comes.
[2555.76 --> 2555.92]  Here everyone comes.
[2555.92 --> 2558.52]  Good morning, everybody.
[2558.52 --> 2560.76]  How's everybody doing?
[2560.76 --> 2563.38]  Where is Hank?
[2564.38 --> 2565.92]  I think, you know what I think you need to do?
[2565.98 --> 2566.72]  I don't think so.
[2567.90 --> 2568.16]  Nope.
[2568.16 --> 2572.78]  I think if you all said, Hank, where are you?
[2572.78 --> 2573.98]  He might show up.
[2573.98 --> 2575.00]  Do you think that's true?
[2575.66 --> 2576.00]  All right.
[2576.20 --> 2577.22]  You have to do it nice and loud.
[2577.28 --> 2577.66]  Are you ready?
[2578.16 --> 2579.72]  One, two, three.
[2579.72 --> 2585.72]  Here he is.
[2586.54 --> 2588.04]  What a rush.
[2589.00 --> 2589.48]  Wow.
[2589.76 --> 2592.46]  What an exciting entrance that was logistically.
[2593.86 --> 2594.58]  All right.
[2595.20 --> 2598.98]  We are going to talk about something pretty cool today in children's worship time, Hank.
[2599.08 --> 2599.96]  What is that?
[2599.96 --> 2604.54]  Well, I have a question, and this is a little bit of a silly question.
[2605.42 --> 2607.18]  How many of you have ever had wine?
[2609.12 --> 2610.14]  No, that's good.
[2610.18 --> 2611.64]  I don't want to out any of your parents.
[2612.02 --> 2613.14]  That's an adult drink.
[2613.24 --> 2614.80]  Yeah, I'm not even allowed it.
[2614.90 --> 2615.40]  You're not?
[2615.70 --> 2615.98]  Nope.
[2616.22 --> 2617.18]  Allergic to grapes.
[2617.54 --> 2617.92]  Oh, yeah.
[2617.96 --> 2618.86]  That's true, I guess, eh?
[2619.04 --> 2619.36]  Mm-hmm.
[2620.18 --> 2626.76]  Well, we are going to hear a story about a wedding that Jesus went to where he turned water,
[2626.76 --> 2629.60]  Mm-hmm, water, into wine.
[2629.98 --> 2630.54]  Blech.
[2632.50 --> 2633.76]  Does that sound kind of fun?
[2634.50 --> 2634.94]  Yeah?
[2635.44 --> 2636.62]  Is that all you got?
[2636.92 --> 2637.44]  What do you mean?
[2637.74 --> 2639.02]  Usually you talk longer.
[2639.44 --> 2640.66]  That's all I have today, Hank.
[2641.22 --> 2641.56]  Hmm.
[2641.82 --> 2644.44]  You know what they say, when life gives you lemons, make lemonade.
[2644.92 --> 2646.42]  I'm not allowed lemonade either.
[2647.16 --> 2647.44]  Oh.
[2647.76 --> 2648.60]  Too much sugar.
[2649.12 --> 2650.08]  I'm a dog.
[2650.88 --> 2651.30]  All right.
[2653.22 --> 2655.64]  I am watching the stickball team still.
[2655.64 --> 2659.22]  So we're going to pray, and then we're going to go off to children's worship time, okay?
[2659.38 --> 2659.78]  Are you ready?
[2659.88 --> 2660.26]  Let's pray.
[2660.62 --> 2661.82]  Dear God, thank you so much for this day.
[2661.90 --> 2665.72]  Thank you that we could gather together here in this place, and that we could worship you.
[2665.88 --> 2668.90]  And we pray now, God, as we head off to children's worship time, and as the adults
[2668.90 --> 2672.64]  stay back here for church, Lord, and listen to Pastor Chris, we pray that we will learn
[2672.64 --> 2674.64]  more about you and your kingdom today.
[2674.78 --> 2675.72]  We pray this in your name.
[2676.20 --> 2676.52]  Amen.
[2676.74 --> 2677.44]  Okay, let's stand up.
[2677.48 --> 2678.20]  We're going to do the blessing.
[2678.84 --> 2679.90]  All right, so turn around.
[2681.14 --> 2683.18]  On the count of three, we're going to say, the Lord be with you.
[2683.18 --> 2683.64]  Are you ready?
[2683.64 --> 2685.14]  One, two, three.
[2685.14 --> 2687.40]  The Lord be with you.
[2688.00 --> 2688.40]  Amen.
[2708.50 --> 2708.98]  Hello.
[2709.36 --> 2713.22]  My name is Allie Stam, and I'm going to be leading us in our church family prayer today.
[2713.70 --> 2715.54]  Before we pray, I have an announcement.
[2716.32 --> 2719.22]  Daniel and Ismay Howling had their baby Saturday morning.
[2720.10 --> 2723.16]  Jed Wolf Howling was born weighing eight pounds and ten ounces.
[2723.62 --> 2727.98]  Mom and everyone are doing really well, and there will be a meal train link for people
[2727.98 --> 2729.94]  to provide meals for them coming soon.
[2730.28 --> 2732.60]  Look in the e-bulletin or on the Facebook group for that.
[2733.24 --> 2733.84]  Let's pray.
[2733.84 --> 2738.96]  Dear Lord, thank you for bringing us all here today.
[2739.30 --> 2741.48]  Thank you that we can gather together as a community.
[2741.96 --> 2746.30]  We often take for granted that we are able to meet together and celebrate our faith as
[2746.30 --> 2747.00]  often as we do.
[2747.70 --> 2752.74]  I pray that we continue to celebrate our faith in whatever way we are able to make fit for
[2752.74 --> 2753.20]  our lives.
[2753.20 --> 2758.06]  As we meet together, I want to pray for all the members of our church community.
[2758.66 --> 2763.44]  Specifically, I want to pray for the Wagener family, Elise Wagener's dad, who has been diagnosed
[2763.44 --> 2764.96]  with stage four prostate cancer.
[2765.50 --> 2770.28]  We pray that all treatments go well and pray that you stay near to him and his family through
[2770.28 --> 2770.70]  this time.
[2770.70 --> 2776.62]  We also pray for Amanda Hoguewoning's sister, Tanya, as she has been diagnosed with stage
[2776.62 --> 2778.94]  four breast cancer and it has spread to other areas.
[2779.56 --> 2784.20]  We pray for strength during this time as she starts new meds, and we pray those meds can
[2784.20 --> 2786.06]  help her and that the side effects are minimal.
[2788.06 --> 2793.42]  Lord, we lift up those who are battling with depression, anxiety, and addiction, asking for
[2793.42 --> 2795.30]  your healing, touch, and peace to surround them.
[2795.98 --> 2798.04]  Please be near to them and show them your love.
[2798.04 --> 2802.86]  We pray that they find the strength in you, Lord, to seek the help and support they need.
[2803.48 --> 2807.34]  May your light shine on them and show them a new path of your grace and love.
[2808.02 --> 2812.78]  We thank you for the birth of Jed Wolfe Howling and that he is healthy and that mom is doing
[2812.78 --> 2813.06]  well.
[2813.84 --> 2817.20]  We pray for Pastor Chris as he comes up to preach and give us the word.
[2817.84 --> 2820.00]  May we have the ears to hear and the hearts to listen.
[2821.02 --> 2825.68]  We want to thank you, Lord, for the countless blessings you have given to us, seen and unseen.
[2825.68 --> 2829.84]  We are grateful for your constant love and guidance through our lives.
[2830.20 --> 2833.60]  May we continue to walk in your grace and share your light with others.
[2834.12 --> 2837.44]  We pray this all in your son's name, who died on the cross for all our sins.
[2837.72 --> 2837.94]  Amen.
[2837.94 --> 2838.04]  Amen.
[2838.04 --> 2860.36]  We are going to spend the next little while looking together at the next section in our
[2860.36 --> 2862.54]  Thessalonians series.
[2862.54 --> 2868.98]  We are going to read 1 Thessalonians 2, 13 through 16.
[2870.30 --> 2879.14]  Before we do that, I want to start off this morning just by simply acknowledging that there
[2879.14 --> 2887.56]  is possibly no greater critic of preaching than preachers.
[2887.56 --> 2896.82]  And so I want to confess to you that when I go to other churches or when I have the opportunity
[2896.82 --> 2906.62]  to sit down under the preaching of other people, some of my default posture is, oh, that's not
[2906.62 --> 2907.60]  how I would have done that.
[2908.26 --> 2911.88]  Or that's not what I think the main point is here.
[2911.88 --> 2917.28]  And I can become rather critical.
[2918.98 --> 2922.02]  Now, I never do that with Josh and Kevin when they preach here.
[2923.88 --> 2927.20]  But that's because by the time they preach here, I've gone through it three or four times
[2927.20 --> 2927.54]  with them.
[2927.60 --> 2929.26]  So they're already saying what I want them to say.
[2931.58 --> 2931.98]  Kidding.
[2933.78 --> 2934.68]  Sort of.
[2934.68 --> 2946.68]  And I will also confess to you that there's no greater critic of my preaching than me.
[2948.46 --> 2950.30]  And so say what you want.
[2950.48 --> 2951.88]  I've already said it to myself.
[2952.84 --> 2954.26]  Come at me however you want.
[2954.32 --> 2956.18]  I've already come at myself in that regard.
[2957.70 --> 2959.32]  Now, why am I starting this way?
[2959.56 --> 2963.56]  Not because I want to tip the scales in favor of you saying, oh, pastor, that was an awesome
[2963.56 --> 2963.88]  sermon.
[2964.06 --> 2964.80]  Thank you for that.
[2965.26 --> 2967.06]  Quite the opposite, actually.
[2971.94 --> 2983.46]  I have been trying to learn how to comprehensively and more intentionally hear the voice of God
[2983.46 --> 2985.54]  in preaching.
[2985.54 --> 2997.50]  Because there's something going on in this moment right now that speaks the voice of God.
[3000.12 --> 3006.62]  And I need to humble myself to not be so arrogant as to determine what God is saying, but rather
[3006.62 --> 3010.10]  to receive what he is saying.
[3010.10 --> 3017.04]  And so as we come into God's word this morning, I wonder if maybe that is a helpful posture
[3017.04 --> 3018.34]  to adopt.
[3018.48 --> 3028.20]  How can we receive in this moment the word of God as a word of grace and hope and encouragement?
[3030.06 --> 3036.80]  Let's read together from 1 Thessalonians 2, starting at verse 13.
[3036.80 --> 3046.68]  And we also thank God continually, because when you received the word of God, which you heard
[3046.68 --> 3053.90]  from us, you accepted it not as a human word, but as it actually is the word of God, which
[3053.90 --> 3056.26]  is indeed at work in you who believe.
[3057.12 --> 3063.84]  For you, brothers and sisters, became imitators of God's churches in Judea, which are in Christ
[3063.84 --> 3064.84]  Jesus.
[3064.84 --> 3070.80]  You suffered from your own people the same things those churches suffered from the Jews
[3070.80 --> 3074.00]  who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets who drove us out.
[3075.06 --> 3080.20]  They displeased God and are hostile to everyone in their effort to keep us from speaking to
[3080.20 --> 3082.22]  the Gentiles so that they may be saved.
[3082.80 --> 3086.12]  In this way, they also heap up their sins to the limit.
[3086.80 --> 3090.12]  The wrath of God has come upon them at last.
[3090.12 --> 3092.18]  The word of the Lord.
[3097.86 --> 3109.34]  What I hope we can begin to see together this morning from these words of Paul is the idea,
[3110.16 --> 3120.06]  the truth that God's word preached is the source of transformation for those who receive it.
[3120.12 --> 3130.32]  That's the preaching of God's word that has a power to change hearts, lives, and minds.
[3130.32 --> 3138.96]  Now, Paul begins this section kind of continuing in a line and theme that he has been on from
[3138.96 --> 3139.38]  the beginning.
[3140.18 --> 3145.12]  He begins by saying, we also thank God continually, right?
[3145.18 --> 3150.40]  That language is a callback to verse 2 of chapter 1.
[3150.40 --> 3160.02]  Remember, Paul is encouraged by the testimony of the Thessalonian church, and so he's grateful
[3160.02 --> 3166.54]  for the ways that they have remained faithful to the gospel that he first proclaimed and preached
[3166.54 --> 3167.70]  to them when he came.
[3168.20 --> 3175.42]  His gratitude to God for the Thessalonian church abounds in this moment and in this letter.
[3175.42 --> 3181.76]  He celebrates their faith that works, to use the language that Kevin led us in, their love
[3181.76 --> 3187.58]  that labors, and their hope that holds fast in trials.
[3187.76 --> 3189.60]  That's verse 3 of chapter 1.
[3190.50 --> 3200.78]  And now he celebrates the truth that they accepted, they heard the word of God as the word of God,
[3200.78 --> 3202.60]  not merely as human words.
[3202.68 --> 3207.42]  It's the word of God, Paul says, that's at work in you who believe.
[3208.20 --> 3209.68]  And that's what he's grateful for.
[3211.32 --> 3219.14]  Paul's gratitude for the way the word of God has transformed the lives of the church in Thessalonica
[3219.14 --> 3220.88]  is profound.
[3220.88 --> 3234.50]  And I wonder, by way of example, how often are you in your lives giving thanks to God for
[3234.50 --> 3240.84]  the way you see him at work through the word in the lives of those around you?
[3242.50 --> 3242.70]  Right?
[3242.78 --> 3250.44]  Have you prayed, Jesus, I thank you for the work that you are doing in their life?
[3250.88 --> 3257.08]  I thank you for the work that you are doing in the lives of those in my church, in my small
[3257.08 --> 3257.44]  group.
[3258.62 --> 3265.10]  Jesus, I thank you for the way your word is changing the people around me.
[3266.44 --> 3272.18]  I'll be honest with you, that's a regular part of my prayers and my prayers of gratitude
[3272.18 --> 3275.06]  because we see that at this church.
[3275.06 --> 3278.26]  It's a regular part of our praying as staff together.
[3279.56 --> 3285.36]  And it's a regular part of the elders' meetings that we have and the elders praying through
[3285.36 --> 3287.06]  the work that we get to do.
[3287.80 --> 3295.54]  It seems clear to those of us with eyes to see who look at this regularly that God is doing
[3295.54 --> 3297.60]  something in our midst.
[3297.60 --> 3303.46]  And I'm really grateful to be able to see that and to be part of that and I give thanks to God
[3303.46 --> 3304.54]  for it.
[3304.62 --> 3314.44]  The encouraging thing that we get to see and that we get to share with you is that God's
[3314.44 --> 3317.84]  word is doing something in our midst.
[3317.84 --> 3321.22]  God's word is doing something in our midst.
[3321.22 --> 3326.88]  This past week, we had the opportunity to gather with a group of about 30 or so small
[3326.88 --> 3336.52]  group leaders and ministry teachers from those who lead the littlest among us to youth leaders,
[3336.84 --> 3343.64]  care group leaders, to those who are leading in the sort of retired and senior ministries around
[3343.64 --> 3350.58]  here, and we gathered all to sort of discuss and to be encouraged and to be equipped on how
[3350.58 --> 3358.98]  what we do is used by God to make disciples, how what we do is used by God to take his word and to
[3358.98 --> 3365.90]  apply it into the lives of those he has given us here, how what we do is used by God to raise up
[3365.90 --> 3373.58]  and encourage the next generation of those who will believe. And at that evening, I'm so great
[3373.58 --> 3379.70]  for the stories we got to share and for the difficulties that we could support each other in.
[3382.18 --> 3387.96]  And throughout all of that, and with all of that in mind, there's a principle,
[3388.96 --> 3395.84]  a principle of gratitude that I want to pull out for a moment with you. And that principle,
[3395.84 --> 3403.82]  I'll state it this way. Practicing gratitude is the antidote to a grumbling attitude.
[3405.72 --> 3411.34]  Practicing gratitude is the antidote to a grumbling attitude. And so I just want to do a quick straw
[3411.34 --> 3418.34]  poll for a minute. How many of you know somebody with a grumbling attitude? Raise your hand.
[3418.34 --> 3424.24]  All right. How many of you know somebody with a propensity for complaining? Don't be afraid. Hold
[3424.24 --> 3431.76]  your hand up. Now, we were timid here. But if you looked around, and if we weren't lying,
[3432.18 --> 3438.86]  you would see that at least half of our hands went up. Now, here's what I want you to think about that.
[3438.86 --> 3449.38]  Okay? That means there's a 50% chance or higher that you are the grumbler that somebody knows.
[3451.80 --> 3458.54]  Are we following that? Now, look, this doesn't surprise us, right? Because we know ourselves,
[3459.16 --> 3465.44]  and we know that our churches are full of sinners now called saints who struggle with sin. And so all
[3465.44 --> 3474.70]  of us do grumble-worthy things. But the command of God, right, is to not grumble even when they do
[3474.70 --> 3481.74]  grumble-worthy things, even when we face grumble-worthy circumstances. Right? In 1 Corinthians,
[3482.20 --> 3489.38]  Paul uses the story of Israel wandering in the wilderness, and he holds them up as a negative example,
[3489.38 --> 3495.42]  and he says, don't be like them, right? Don't be idolaters, he says in 1 Corinthians 10, 7. He says,
[3495.44 --> 3505.56]  don't test Christ, and then he says, do not grumble. James, in his epistle, like the Apostle Paul here in
[3505.56 --> 3515.42]  Thessalonians, he looks to Jesus' return as the impetus, the ground for patience and for faithfulness.
[3515.88 --> 3524.34]  And he says, be patient and stand firm because the Lord's coming is near. Do not grumble against one
[3524.34 --> 3534.66]  another, brothers and sisters, or you will be judged. And so, how is it that we don't grumble?
[3536.24 --> 3542.92]  Well, by doing what Paul does in our text, right? We have gratitude to God for the way that he is
[3542.92 --> 3550.10]  working in the lives around us, right? Gratitude transforms your imaginations from being captive
[3550.10 --> 3557.36]  to the immediate and opens your minds to what is possible in the transcendent, right? Gratitude
[3557.36 --> 3565.16]  changes the way you see your present circumstances because you're training yourself to see God at work.
[3566.40 --> 3573.86]  And if you can see God at work over here in this mess, right? And if you can see God at work over here
[3573.86 --> 3582.20]  in this circumstance, right? You can have faith that he will do something similar over here. And you can
[3582.20 --> 3591.86]  have patience for when he comes to do it. Or you can have faith that if he doesn't do that, he's doing
[3591.86 --> 3600.48]  something even greater for his glory, something different for his and your good. You just can't yet see it.
[3600.48 --> 3609.80]  Right? A heart of gratitude is training to accept a God of goodness even when he is hidden.
[3611.20 --> 3617.76]  A heart filled with gratitude for the ways in which God is at work doesn't dwell on the ways in which
[3617.76 --> 3628.64]  other people are or aren't working in ways that frustrate you. If we don't focus on gratitude to God,
[3628.64 --> 3640.94]  grumbling is the sort of default response. Gratitude is the grace-filled supernatural response.
[3642.56 --> 3649.30]  So as we are applying this principle, think for a minute, the next time that you are tempted to grumble,
[3649.68 --> 3652.64]  try asking yourself, I wonder how God is working here.
[3652.64 --> 3661.60]  Or try asking yourself, is God asking me to be part of a story of gratitude for his working right now?
[3663.60 --> 3670.66]  And as you go today, ask, how are you in your words and in your attitudes,
[3670.66 --> 3677.74]  how are you contributing to a culture here of gratitude over grumbling?
[3681.30 --> 3688.56]  And maybe the next time someone grumbles to you, you might have the courage to stop them
[3688.56 --> 3692.30]  and just ask, where are you seeing God right now?
[3692.30 --> 3697.24]  How is God at work in your life right now?
[3697.72 --> 3699.00]  Where is God showing up?
[3699.68 --> 3701.42]  Or where do you need him to show up?
[3702.60 --> 3708.16]  And if you are seeing him over here, maybe, maybe you can wait for him over here.
[3709.08 --> 3713.12]  And maybe that is something we need to pray about rather than grumble about.
[3715.12 --> 3719.66]  Practicing gratitude is the antidote for a grumbling attitude.
[3722.30 --> 3725.24]  Now hold that in your brain for a moment.
[3726.82 --> 3732.80]  So let's notice next exactly what it is that Paul is grateful for.
[3732.90 --> 3737.04]  He says, we thank God because when you received the word of God,
[3737.04 --> 3741.78]  which you heard from us, you accepted it not as a human word,
[3741.94 --> 3746.38]  but as it actually is the word of God.
[3746.38 --> 3753.62]  So Paul is grateful for the way the Thessalonian church has received the word of God.
[3753.90 --> 3759.36]  But notice here, right, a characteristic of the word of God that they received that he is grateful for.
[3760.66 --> 3761.94]  They heard it.
[3763.54 --> 3769.16]  Paul is talking about the way they heard the word of God preached.
[3769.16 --> 3776.32]  Paul came to them and he preached in the Spirit and the Spirit used his preaching to transform their lives.
[3777.50 --> 3780.98]  We read in Romans 10 that this is actually the normal pattern.
[3781.48 --> 3783.16]  Romans 10 verse 17 says,
[3783.56 --> 3790.00]  Faith comes from hearing the message and the message heard is through the word about Christ.
[3790.00 --> 3795.18]  You received the word of God which you heard from us not as a human word,
[3795.26 --> 3800.50]  but as it actually is a word of God.
[3801.58 --> 3811.10]  In 1 Peter 1, 23 to 25, there's a long section there and a continuous thought that starts
[3811.10 --> 3818.66]  and it says that the living and enduring word of God is the word that was preached to you.
[3820.00 --> 3821.66]  So here's what I want us to be hearing, right?
[3821.72 --> 3826.72]  That somehow, somehow in the economy of God's work in the world,
[3826.88 --> 3832.34]  the preached word is the means by which he brings salvation and faith to people.
[3833.22 --> 3838.46]  Such that when the preacher stands up and opens the word of God and begins to preach,
[3838.82 --> 3845.26]  insofar as he is faithful to the message, it is God's voice through him to you.
[3846.94 --> 3848.36]  Now this means a couple things.
[3848.36 --> 3857.24]  First, for those of us who preach, it means we better take this task and responsibility seriously.
[3858.76 --> 3864.26]  It means we better make our hearts willing and subservient to the will of God.
[3865.22 --> 3865.58]  Right?
[3865.62 --> 3870.18]  I want to be a humble and willing tool in the hands of God.
[3870.18 --> 3875.24]  So that it might be his voice that comes through me.
[3876.96 --> 3879.46]  But it also changes the way you listen.
[3880.54 --> 3885.28]  Because it means that even the most average preachers,
[3885.44 --> 3887.92]  even the most mediocre preachers like myself,
[3888.08 --> 3892.14]  are used by God to speak his voice.
[3892.14 --> 3895.62]  God is faithful.
[3896.74 --> 3902.26]  And that means there's always, always something here for you.
[3902.94 --> 3906.78]  There's always a word of God for your heart.
[3908.70 --> 3913.38]  There's always a word of God for your faith.
[3913.38 --> 3919.84]  Now, you may not be entertained,
[3920.84 --> 3923.26]  but God is still speaking.
[3923.26 --> 3927.76]  The preacher may not be the most riveting,
[3928.56 --> 3931.50]  but God is still speaking.
[3931.50 --> 3943.38]  And look, lest you think that this is an attempt to platform myself or Kevin or Josh for our own words,
[3943.76 --> 3948.86]  this has been the understanding of the Christian church from its beginning.
[3950.54 --> 3955.50]  A preached word of God is the word of God.
[3955.50 --> 3956.70]  Let me give you a couple examples.
[3957.90 --> 3961.22]  We'll move out of this era to make this point.
[3961.64 --> 3965.70]  In the 1560s, okay, almost 500 years ago,
[3966.72 --> 3970.16]  the Second Helvetic Confession was written.
[3971.42 --> 3977.24]  This is a lesser-known Reformed Confession written by Henry Bollinger.
[3977.72 --> 3979.48]  He's a Swiss theologian.
[3980.42 --> 3983.32]  This confession became popular in the Swiss Reformed churches.
[3983.32 --> 3986.82]  And there, in the middle of that confession,
[3987.42 --> 3988.06]  it reads,
[3988.40 --> 3992.78]  the preaching of the word is the word of God.
[3994.12 --> 3996.60]  This idea is worked out in our own tradition,
[3996.86 --> 3998.24]  in the Heidelberg Catechism.
[3998.58 --> 4000.60]  Question and answer 83 through 85
[4000.60 --> 4004.52]  explains what it is we believe Jesus means
[4004.52 --> 4007.42]  when he talks about the keys of the kingdom
[4007.42 --> 4009.42]  that are given to the church.
[4010.34 --> 4012.54]  Preaching is one of the keys of the kingdom
[4012.54 --> 4015.48]  whereby heaven is open to those who believe
[4015.48 --> 4018.74]  by grace through faith and close to those who don't.
[4020.52 --> 4022.36]  John Calvin is a French theologian
[4022.36 --> 4024.94]  from this same time period in the 16th century.
[4025.84 --> 4027.70]  In the Institutes of the Christian Religion,
[4028.24 --> 4028.92]  he writes this,
[4029.04 --> 4030.74]  and I think these are just beautiful words.
[4031.74 --> 4032.14]  He writes,
[4032.14 --> 4053.60]  Now, lest you think this is a Protestant truth,
[4053.96 --> 4055.30]  let me keep going even further.
[4055.30 --> 4059.70]  In his sermon for the Feast of Pentecost,
[4059.86 --> 4063.02]  Aquinas, one of the greatest theologians
[4063.02 --> 4066.70]  in the history of the church in the 12th century,
[4067.24 --> 4069.24]  emphasizes the transformative power
[4069.82 --> 4072.22]  of the Holy Spirit in preaching.
[4072.36 --> 4074.02]  And I'm going to summarize one of the main points
[4074.02 --> 4075.46]  in that sermon that he gives,
[4075.52 --> 4078.20]  is that the Holy Spirit makes the tongue
[4078.20 --> 4080.44]  of the preacher efficacious,
[4080.44 --> 4082.70]  that is, it gives it power and effective,
[4083.28 --> 4086.06]  so that the preacher can worthily
[4086.06 --> 4089.30]  and fruitfully set forth the Word of God.
[4091.08 --> 4092.98]  And we can keep going back further, right?
[4093.04 --> 4095.24]  Because again, this is the history of the church.
[4095.70 --> 4097.94]  Augustine, a 4th century church father,
[4098.16 --> 4099.48]  now from North Africa,
[4100.68 --> 4101.70]  he says that,
[4101.70 --> 4105.00]  We should not find it surprising
[4105.00 --> 4107.58]  that to meet our weakness,
[4107.78 --> 4111.34]  Christ descended to the discreet sounds
[4111.34 --> 4112.38]  that we use.
[4113.76 --> 4115.84]  He goes on to say,
[4117.12 --> 4120.86]  I feed you on what I feed on myself.
[4122.44 --> 4122.90]  Right?
[4122.96 --> 4124.16]  So I feed you the Word
[4124.16 --> 4125.74]  as I feed on it myself.
[4126.02 --> 4127.20]  I am just a waiter.
[4127.36 --> 4128.62]  I am not a master of the house.
[4128.62 --> 4131.00]  I set before you from the pantry
[4131.00 --> 4133.24]  which I too live on.
[4133.96 --> 4134.80]  And I'll be honest with you,
[4135.00 --> 4135.84]  I could keep going.
[4137.22 --> 4138.68]  Yesterday I was in my study
[4138.68 --> 4140.50]  trying to put some final touches
[4140.50 --> 4141.32]  on these things
[4141.32 --> 4143.16]  and Rachel called me at 4 o'clock
[4143.16 --> 4143.88]  and she said,
[4143.94 --> 4144.80]  Hey, are you coming home?
[4145.74 --> 4146.04]  And I said,
[4146.08 --> 4146.74]  What time is it?
[4147.46 --> 4149.04]  She pulled me out of this deep dive
[4149.04 --> 4150.60]  that I was doing in the midst of this.
[4150.98 --> 4152.94]  I spent like an hour and a half
[4152.94 --> 4154.00]  reading Irenaeus,
[4154.08 --> 4155.88]  who's a second century church father
[4155.88 --> 4159.10]  who argues from the apostolic tradition
[4159.10 --> 4161.32]  that preaching is the means
[4161.32 --> 4162.78]  by which the gospel continues
[4162.78 --> 4163.46]  to be affirmed.
[4163.66 --> 4164.60]  Point is,
[4164.96 --> 4166.52]  this is how the church
[4166.52 --> 4168.26]  has always understood
[4168.26 --> 4170.66]  the way God speaks to His people.
[4172.26 --> 4172.48]  Right?
[4172.52 --> 4174.68]  The Word of God starts actually
[4174.68 --> 4176.48]  as an oral reality
[4176.48 --> 4177.38]  of God Himself
[4177.38 --> 4180.70]  speaking creation into being.
[4181.24 --> 4182.86]  Of speaking to Adam and Eve
[4182.86 --> 4183.42]  in the garden
[4183.42 --> 4184.40]  as He walks with Him
[4184.40 --> 4185.68]  in the cool of the day.
[4186.20 --> 4187.40]  Speaking through angels.
[4187.40 --> 4189.44]  The Word of God continues orally
[4189.44 --> 4190.38]  and is memorized
[4190.38 --> 4191.76]  in tradition
[4191.76 --> 4192.82]  and in family.
[4193.00 --> 4194.60]  It's spoken by the patriarchs
[4194.60 --> 4195.74]  and by the storytellers
[4195.74 --> 4196.76]  of the community.
[4197.06 --> 4198.00]  It's written
[4198.00 --> 4199.70]  and collected
[4199.70 --> 4200.58]  by Moses
[4200.58 --> 4201.52]  all the while
[4201.52 --> 4202.16]  continuing
[4202.16 --> 4203.48]  in its oral form
[4203.48 --> 4203.92]  and speech
[4203.92 --> 4204.96]  as God is progressively
[4204.96 --> 4206.04]  revealing Himself
[4206.04 --> 4206.70]  more and more
[4206.70 --> 4207.44]  through the prophets.
[4208.56 --> 4209.20]  And then
[4209.20 --> 4210.88]  in the most amazing
[4210.88 --> 4211.94]  of all miracles
[4211.94 --> 4214.00]  the Word of God
[4214.00 --> 4215.40]  took on flesh.
[4215.40 --> 4217.68]  In John 1
[4217.68 --> 4218.48]  we read that
[4218.48 --> 4219.02]  in the beginning
[4219.02 --> 4219.68]  was the Word
[4219.68 --> 4220.54]  and the Word was God
[4220.54 --> 4221.28]  and the Word was with God
[4221.28 --> 4222.30]  He was God in the beginning
[4222.30 --> 4223.88]  and then in John 1.14
[4223.88 --> 4225.78]  the Word took on flesh
[4225.78 --> 4227.22]  and made His dwelling among us.
[4227.52 --> 4228.88]  And so God has always
[4228.88 --> 4230.20]  communicated Himself
[4230.20 --> 4231.80]  mediated Himself
[4231.80 --> 4233.18]  through the Word
[4233.18 --> 4234.10]  and that Word
[4234.10 --> 4235.20]  has taken on flesh
[4235.20 --> 4236.56]  in the person of Jesus Christ
[4236.56 --> 4237.94]  and now we continue
[4237.94 --> 4239.26]  to hear the voice
[4239.26 --> 4240.88]  of that same Jesus
[4240.88 --> 4243.06]  in the preached Word.
[4243.06 --> 4245.54]  This is the miracle
[4245.54 --> 4246.86]  of our faith
[4246.86 --> 4248.08]  and it is a miracle
[4248.08 --> 4248.74]  of incarnation
[4248.74 --> 4249.92]  that continues
[4249.92 --> 4250.90]  to be worked out
[4250.90 --> 4252.48]  week in and week out
[4252.48 --> 4253.66]  as we gather together
[4253.66 --> 4254.92]  under the Word.
[4255.60 --> 4256.26]  This is the point
[4256.26 --> 4256.90]  that Paul makes
[4256.90 --> 4257.76]  when he commissions
[4257.76 --> 4259.24]  the next generation
[4259.24 --> 4260.22]  of apostles
[4260.22 --> 4261.16]  just as Christ
[4261.16 --> 4262.18]  commissioned the apostles
[4262.18 --> 4262.96]  to preach the Word
[4262.96 --> 4264.06]  Paul commissions
[4264.06 --> 4265.68]  Timothy and Titus
[4265.68 --> 4267.40]  to hold out
[4267.40 --> 4268.46]  the Word of life.
[4269.46 --> 4270.34]  And it's at this point
[4270.34 --> 4272.12]  that the early church
[4272.12 --> 4273.48]  expressing through
[4273.48 --> 4274.44]  written forms
[4274.44 --> 4275.40]  what had been
[4275.40 --> 4276.40]  the teaching
[4276.40 --> 4277.12]  and tradition
[4277.12 --> 4278.04]  of the apostles
[4278.04 --> 4278.90]  throughout
[4278.90 --> 4279.76]  and we note it
[4279.76 --> 4280.74]  in the letters
[4280.74 --> 4281.70]  that Paul has written
[4281.70 --> 4283.76]  we notice in the letters
[4283.76 --> 4284.94]  that John and Peter
[4284.94 --> 4285.60]  James
[4285.60 --> 4287.10]  the letter to the Hebrews
[4287.10 --> 4287.70]  Revelation
[4287.70 --> 4291.10]  in all these things
[4291.10 --> 4293.68]  the Word of God
[4293.68 --> 4294.40]  first taught
[4294.40 --> 4295.20]  and expressed
[4295.20 --> 4296.16]  orally
[4296.16 --> 4297.12]  and then
[4297.12 --> 4298.30]  which was written down
[4298.30 --> 4300.78]  all of that
[4300.78 --> 4301.84]  right
[4301.84 --> 4302.74]  is the Word
[4302.74 --> 4303.72]  of God
[4303.72 --> 4305.70]  and this oral ministry
[4305.70 --> 4306.58]  of the Word of God
[4306.58 --> 4307.32]  continues
[4307.32 --> 4308.36]  throughout
[4308.36 --> 4309.98]  ministers and theologians
[4309.98 --> 4310.74]  today.
[4312.06 --> 4312.28]  Now
[4312.28 --> 4313.58]  at this point
[4313.58 --> 4314.06]  we need to
[4314.06 --> 4315.84]  slow down for a minute
[4315.84 --> 4318.06]  because this is really
[4318.06 --> 4318.90]  important for me to say
[4318.90 --> 4322.04]  the only way
[4322.04 --> 4323.44]  the only way
[4323.44 --> 4324.64]  that you can know
[4324.64 --> 4325.90]  the Word of God
[4325.90 --> 4327.44]  spoken orally
[4327.44 --> 4329.32]  is by testing it
[4329.32 --> 4330.28]  against the record
[4330.28 --> 4330.84]  of Scripture
[4330.84 --> 4332.52]  in its written form.
[4333.48 --> 4334.82]  The written Word
[4334.82 --> 4335.34]  of God
[4335.34 --> 4336.22]  is the only
[4336.22 --> 4337.36]  infallible rule
[4337.36 --> 4338.32]  for life and faith
[4338.32 --> 4339.56]  by which we must
[4339.56 --> 4340.66]  test the spoken
[4340.66 --> 4342.42]  words of God
[4342.42 --> 4342.76]  and so
[4342.76 --> 4343.76]  every Sunday
[4343.76 --> 4344.44]  when I'm up here
[4344.44 --> 4344.80]  preaching
[4344.80 --> 4345.64]  proclaiming to you
[4345.64 --> 4346.24]  what I believe
[4346.24 --> 4346.74]  faithfully
[4346.74 --> 4347.76]  to be the Word of God
[4347.76 --> 4349.00]  you need to know
[4349.00 --> 4349.62]  the Scriptures
[4349.62 --> 4351.34]  to test it
[4351.34 --> 4353.26]  and see that it is true.
[4353.26 --> 4356.14]  This must be
[4356.14 --> 4357.82]  part of our
[4357.82 --> 4358.78]  work
[4358.78 --> 4359.96]  together.
[4361.00 --> 4361.98]  The Word of God
[4361.98 --> 4362.92]  spoken orally
[4362.92 --> 4364.16]  must be tested
[4364.16 --> 4365.78]  against the Word of God
[4365.78 --> 4367.06]  written infallibly
[4367.06 --> 4367.94]  in order for us
[4367.94 --> 4368.46]  to know
[4368.46 --> 4369.12]  that it
[4369.12 --> 4370.32]  is true.
[4371.88 --> 4373.02]  Because the Scriptures
[4373.02 --> 4374.28]  are the infallible
[4374.28 --> 4375.26]  rule of God
[4375.26 --> 4376.16]  the Scriptures
[4376.16 --> 4377.58]  are the revelation
[4377.58 --> 4378.64]  of the God
[4378.64 --> 4379.54]  who speaks, right?
[4379.60 --> 4380.42]  The infallibility
[4380.42 --> 4381.02]  of the Scripture
[4381.02 --> 4381.74]  is connected
[4381.74 --> 4382.70]  to the character
[4382.70 --> 4383.36]  of the God
[4383.36 --> 4384.14]  who speaks them.
[4385.42 --> 4385.96]  So if you've ever
[4385.96 --> 4386.44]  wondered why
[4386.44 --> 4387.40]  we trust the Bible
[4387.40 --> 4389.02]  it's because God
[4389.02 --> 4389.66]  is trustworthy
[4389.66 --> 4391.68]  and so when He speaks
[4391.68 --> 4393.46]  He speaks only truth.
[4395.90 --> 4396.84]  But that's how
[4396.84 --> 4397.80]  we can identify
[4397.80 --> 4399.58]  what the early
[4399.58 --> 4400.30]  church fathers
[4400.30 --> 4401.30]  called the
[4401.30 --> 4402.48]  viva vox dei
[4402.48 --> 4404.18]  the living voice
[4404.18 --> 4404.84]  of God.
[4406.48 --> 4407.52]  My job
[4407.52 --> 4408.82]  and anyone
[4408.82 --> 4409.38]  who stands
[4409.38 --> 4410.28]  on this stage
[4410.28 --> 4410.78]  and opens
[4410.78 --> 4411.28]  the Scriptures
[4411.28 --> 4411.94]  for you
[4411.94 --> 4413.72]  is to be
[4413.72 --> 4414.66]  a mouthpiece
[4414.66 --> 4415.82]  for the living
[4415.82 --> 4417.60]  voice of God.
[4418.70 --> 4419.98]  I must decrease
[4419.98 --> 4420.64]  so that He
[4420.64 --> 4421.66]  may increase
[4421.66 --> 4422.60]  and when you
[4422.60 --> 4423.74]  receive the Word
[4423.74 --> 4424.20]  of God
[4424.20 --> 4425.16]  that you hear
[4425.16 --> 4425.78]  from me
[4425.78 --> 4426.46]  the question
[4426.46 --> 4427.78]  on your hearts
[4427.78 --> 4429.30]  must be
[4429.30 --> 4430.64]  do you hear
[4430.64 --> 4431.36]  this
[4431.36 --> 4432.10]  as
[4432.10 --> 4433.96]  it is
[4433.96 --> 4435.80]  as a word
[4435.80 --> 4437.24]  from God?
[4437.24 --> 4442.24]  how do we know
[4442.24 --> 4442.62]  it's a word
[4442.62 --> 4443.08]  from God?
[4444.70 --> 4445.22]  One
[4445.22 --> 4446.88]  it's confirmed
[4446.88 --> 4447.64]  by the Scriptures
[4447.64 --> 4449.26]  right?
[4449.32 --> 4449.86]  We test
[4449.86 --> 4450.50]  the Spirit
[4450.50 --> 4451.62]  and we see
[4451.62 --> 4452.74]  that it is true
[4452.74 --> 4453.78]  that the two
[4453.78 --> 4454.24]  accord
[4454.24 --> 4455.46]  because the Spirit
[4455.46 --> 4456.00]  will speak
[4456.00 --> 4457.32]  with one voice.
[4458.20 --> 4458.72]  Two
[4458.72 --> 4459.62]  we know
[4459.62 --> 4460.04]  that it is
[4460.04 --> 4460.88]  the Word of God
[4460.88 --> 4462.06]  because lives
[4462.06 --> 4463.30]  are transformed
[4463.30 --> 4464.62]  right?
[4464.62 --> 4464.90]  we know
[4464.90 --> 4465.20]  that it's
[4465.20 --> 4465.44]  the Word
[4465.44 --> 4465.72]  of God
[4465.72 --> 4466.48]  because by it
[4466.48 --> 4467.22]  you become
[4467.22 --> 4468.28]  imitators
[4468.28 --> 4469.74]  imitators
[4469.74 --> 4470.40]  of Christ
[4470.40 --> 4471.28]  imitators
[4471.28 --> 4471.72]  of other
[4471.72 --> 4472.10]  mature
[4472.10 --> 4472.76]  disciples
[4472.76 --> 4473.76]  imitators
[4473.76 --> 4474.12]  of those
[4474.12 --> 4474.58]  examples
[4474.58 --> 4475.12]  of faith
[4475.12 --> 4475.82]  and godliness
[4475.82 --> 4476.50]  that He
[4476.50 --> 4476.92]  has set
[4476.92 --> 4477.46]  before you
[4477.46 --> 4478.28]  imitators
[4478.28 --> 4478.92]  of God's
[4478.92 --> 4479.28]  church
[4479.28 --> 4480.04]  that's what
[4480.04 --> 4481.08]  Paul grounds
[4481.08 --> 4481.74]  his argument
[4481.74 --> 4482.20]  in here
[4482.20 --> 4482.54]  he says
[4482.54 --> 4483.14]  you received
[4483.14 --> 4483.48]  the Word
[4483.48 --> 4483.88]  of God
[4483.88 --> 4484.28]  and so
[4484.28 --> 4484.80]  by it
[4484.80 --> 4485.68]  you became
[4485.68 --> 4486.38]  imitators
[4486.38 --> 4486.94]  of the churches
[4486.94 --> 4487.66]  in Judea
[4487.66 --> 4488.82]  and in that
[4488.82 --> 4490.82]  point of comparison
[4490.82 --> 4491.58]  that Paul is
[4491.58 --> 4491.88]  making
[4491.88 --> 4492.18]  he says
[4492.18 --> 4493.44]  those Christians
[4493.44 --> 4494.14]  those early
[4494.14 --> 4494.52]  Christians
[4494.52 --> 4495.18]  in Judea
[4495.18 --> 4496.66]  also suffered
[4496.66 --> 4497.30]  from their
[4497.30 --> 4497.84]  own people
[4497.84 --> 4498.54]  in the same
[4498.54 --> 4499.38]  way that you
[4499.38 --> 4500.12]  have suffered
[4500.12 --> 4500.98]  from your
[4500.98 --> 4501.50]  own people
[4501.50 --> 4501.92]  remember
[4501.92 --> 4502.56]  when the
[4502.56 --> 4502.90]  believers
[4502.90 --> 4503.96]  first became
[4503.96 --> 4504.36]  Christian
[4504.36 --> 4505.18]  in Thessalonica
[4505.18 --> 4506.48]  they were
[4506.48 --> 4507.14]  challenged
[4507.14 --> 4508.08]  and persecuted
[4508.08 --> 4509.18]  and they
[4509.18 --> 4509.94]  were arrested
[4509.94 --> 4511.18]  they suffered
[4511.18 --> 4512.30]  from their
[4512.30 --> 4513.38]  own people
[4513.38 --> 4514.52]  and Paul
[4514.52 --> 4514.80]  is saying
[4514.80 --> 4515.56]  this is
[4515.56 --> 4515.84]  what
[4515.84 --> 4517.26]  discipleship
[4517.26 --> 4518.44]  looks like
[4518.44 --> 4519.64]  in fact
[4519.64 --> 4521.96]  suffering
[4521.96 --> 4523.56]  for the
[4523.56 --> 4524.00]  gospel
[4524.00 --> 4525.80]  is confirmation
[4525.80 --> 4527.38]  of transformation
[4527.38 --> 4528.52]  by the
[4528.52 --> 4528.92]  gospel
[4528.92 --> 4530.34]  or to put it
[4530.34 --> 4530.84]  another way
[4530.84 --> 4532.56]  peculiarity
[4532.56 --> 4533.28]  for those of
[4533.28 --> 4533.96]  us who believe
[4533.96 --> 4536.00]  is a
[4536.00 --> 4536.64]  proof
[4536.64 --> 4538.30]  that it's
[4538.30 --> 4539.54]  true
[4539.54 --> 4540.36]  in your
[4540.36 --> 4540.68]  heart
[4540.68 --> 4541.86]  and in
[4541.86 --> 4542.38]  your lives
[4542.38 --> 4545.88]  and so
[4545.88 --> 4548.10]  when someone
[4548.10 --> 4548.92]  calls you
[4548.92 --> 4549.66]  strange
[4549.66 --> 4551.12]  or weird
[4551.12 --> 4552.20]  because of
[4552.20 --> 4552.74]  your Christian
[4552.74 --> 4553.28]  faith
[4553.28 --> 4555.68]  do what we
[4555.68 --> 4556.08]  read in the
[4556.08 --> 4556.44]  scriptures
[4556.44 --> 4557.38]  rejoice
[4557.38 --> 4558.80]  because you
[4558.80 --> 4559.38]  get to suffer
[4559.38 --> 4560.64]  for that name
[4560.64 --> 4562.08]  because it
[4562.08 --> 4562.86]  means God's
[4562.86 --> 4563.58]  work is
[4563.58 --> 4564.66]  really working
[4564.66 --> 4565.46]  his voice
[4565.46 --> 4566.10]  is really
[4566.10 --> 4567.08]  real and
[4567.08 --> 4567.82]  it is really
[4567.82 --> 4568.80]  speaking to
[4568.80 --> 4569.96]  you in
[4569.96 --> 4570.74]  your
[4570.74 --> 4571.94]  life
[4571.94 --> 4573.62]  God's
[4573.62 --> 4573.92]  word
[4573.92 --> 4574.50]  preached
[4574.50 --> 4575.28]  is the
[4575.28 --> 4575.70]  source
[4575.70 --> 4576.04]  of
[4576.04 --> 4576.68]  transformation
[4576.68 --> 4578.00]  for those
[4578.00 --> 4578.78]  who
[4578.78 --> 4580.02]  receive it
[4580.02 --> 4581.86]  and so
[4581.86 --> 4582.50]  really quickly
[4582.50 --> 4583.72]  I want to
[4583.72 --> 4584.26]  land this
[4584.26 --> 4584.78]  plane
[4584.78 --> 4586.16]  with some
[4586.16 --> 4586.78]  ideas
[4586.78 --> 4587.72]  and practical
[4587.72 --> 4588.64]  steps of
[4588.64 --> 4589.22]  application
[4589.22 --> 4590.20]  for you
[4590.20 --> 4591.18]  to transform
[4591.18 --> 4592.16]  your hearing
[4592.16 --> 4592.94]  so that you
[4592.94 --> 4593.32]  can be
[4593.32 --> 4593.84]  transformed
[4593.84 --> 4594.70]  by hearing
[4594.70 --> 4596.08]  first of all
[4596.08 --> 4597.20]  what's one
[4597.20 --> 4597.76]  thing that you
[4597.76 --> 4598.40]  can do
[4598.40 --> 4599.28]  to hear
[4599.28 --> 4599.74]  the voice
[4599.74 --> 4600.12]  of God
[4600.12 --> 4600.78]  well pray
[4600.78 --> 4602.04]  pray
[4602.04 --> 4602.86]  pray before

[4606.38 --> 4607.06]  and on Sunday
[4607.06 --> 4607.44]  morning
[4607.44 --> 4608.38]  that in this
[4608.38 --> 4608.78]  moment
[4608.78 --> 4609.88]  through this
[4609.88 --> 4610.94]  feeble attempt
[4610.94 --> 4611.50]  of mine
[4611.50 --> 4612.56]  you might hear
[4612.56 --> 4613.56]  the infallible
[4613.56 --> 4614.82]  word of God
[4614.82 --> 4616.22]  that you might
[4616.22 --> 4617.24]  hear the voice
[4617.24 --> 4618.10]  of the living
[4618.10 --> 4618.98]  God
[4618.98 --> 4620.44]  pray that
[4620.44 --> 4621.40]  what you need
[4621.40 --> 4622.16]  to hear from
[4622.16 --> 4622.92]  God would not
[4622.92 --> 4623.58]  only be the
[4623.58 --> 4624.50]  truth of God
[4624.50 --> 4625.24]  but would be
[4625.24 --> 4626.40]  what your heart
[4626.40 --> 4627.50]  is crying out
[4627.50 --> 4627.86]  for
[4627.86 --> 4628.96]  what your soul
[4628.96 --> 4629.98]  is longing for
[4629.98 --> 4630.42]  so that you

[4631.30 --> 4632.00]  and rest
[4632.00 --> 4633.16]  in the words
[4633.16 --> 4634.50]  of Jesus
[4634.50 --> 4636.28]  and then
[4636.28 --> 4637.40]  after praying
[4637.40 --> 4638.30]  and hearing
[4638.30 --> 4639.64]  I suggest

[4647.10 --> 4647.90]  be hearers
[4647.90 --> 4648.48]  of the word

[4654.92 --> 4655.64]  of practice
[4655.64 --> 4656.32]  is also

[4671.68 --> 4672.40]  what the Lord
[4672.40 --> 4673.02]  is calling

[4844.04 --> 4844.56]  hear
[4844.56 --> 4845.62]  the living
[4845.62 --> 4846.86]  voice

[4895.50 --> 4895.90]  you would
[4895.90 --> 4896.44]  take these

[5346.90 --> 5348.90]  If you would like to meet someone for prayer
[5348.90 --> 5350.90]  There will be someone here up at the front
[5350.90 --> 5351.90]  With a tag on
[5351.90 --> 5353.90]  They'd love to meet you and pray with you
[5353.90 --> 5355.10]  Over whatever it is
[5355.10 --> 5356.70]  Whether in celebration
[5356.70 --> 5358.50]  Or in crying out
[5358.50 --> 5361.10]  To meet you and pray with you
[5361.10 --> 5365.04]  Second, as we stick around afterwards for fellowship
[5365.04 --> 5369.10]  And maybe even extending into lunch and soup together
[5369.10 --> 5372.52]  Just encourage you in your groups or tables
[5372.52 --> 5374.58]  To ask each other the question
[5374.58 --> 5376.78]  Where have you seen God at work?
[5377.62 --> 5380.44]  What are you grateful for that God is doing in your life?
[5380.44 --> 5385.30]  And then maybe if you're so willing and have the courage
[5385.30 --> 5388.38]  Invite someone and share with someone
[5388.38 --> 5391.74]  Where you need to see God at work
[5391.74 --> 5395.72]  Where you long for him to show up and be present with you
[5395.72 --> 5400.44]  Receive the blessing of our God as we go this week

[5405.16 --> 5408.14]  Sanctify you through and through
[5408.14 --> 5411.24]  May your whole spirit, body, and soul
[5411.24 --> 5414.94]  Be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[5414.94 --> 5417.54]  The one who calls you is faithful

[5420.38 --> 5421.62]  Amen
[5421.62 --> 5443.42]  We praise thee, O God

[5524.70 --> 5528.14]  Revive us again.
[5529.94 --> 5533.54]  Revive us again.
[5533.54 --> 5537.26]  Fill each heart with thy love.

[5544.56 --> 5547.60]  Hallelujah, thine the glory.
