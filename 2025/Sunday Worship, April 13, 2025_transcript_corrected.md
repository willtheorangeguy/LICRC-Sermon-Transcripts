[1529.90 → 1559.88] Thank you.
[1559.88 → 1589.86] Hosanna, Hosanna.
[1589.86 → 1594.86] Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[1596.86 → 1606.86] Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[1608.86 → 1611.86] Hosanna in the highest.
[1619.86 → 1622.86] I invite you all to take a seat.
[1638.86 → 1642.86] I'll be reading The King by Tanner Olson.
[1643.86 → 1646.86] You've done things differently, and you've never failed.
[1646.86 → 1654.86] Like the time you turned water to wine, or like you rubbed mud on the blind man's eyes so he could see.
[1655.86 → 1659.86] Or when you healed the paralyzed man because his friends truly believed.
[1660.86 → 1664.86] Or when you healed the paralyzed man because, sorry, truly believed.
[1665.86 → 1669.86] And like the time you entered Jerusalem, riding on the back of a colt, and they asked who is this,
[1670.86 → 1673.86] and they along with the rest of the world would soon know.
[1673.86 → 1676.86] They knew you as the one who healed the sick and fed the poor.
[1677.86 → 1681.86] The one who turned lives inside out and upside down.
[1682.86 → 1690.86] The one who had 12 close friends, raised a man named Lazarus from the dead, and told the cripple to get out of bed.
[1690.86 → 1692.86] But soon he would see you.
[1692.86 → 1695.86] Soon they would see you.
[1695.86 → 1698.86] More than anyone had come before.
[1698.86 → 1700.86] Just in time, hope had arrived.
[1700.86 → 1705.86] Some cheered and cried, Hosanna, save us, save us now, please save us.
[1706.86 → 1711.86] They waved palm branches and laid them down so they wouldn't have to touch the ground.
[1711.86 → 1717.86] Children sat at the shoulders of parents, and they pointed to the one they had been waiting for.
[1718.86 → 1724.86] Echoes of Jesus, Lord, filled the city as you moved forward the beginning of the end.
[1724.86 → 1728.86] And we thought that the king was coming to take his crown.
[1728.86 → 1735.86] But you knew the king was coming to be buried in the ground, to bring us from lost to found.
[1736.86 → 1745.86] Good arrives only to die, only to rise, only for the world to realize you are who you say you are, the king.
[1745.86 → 1752.86] Please stand and join us as we sing the Lion and the Lamb.
[1752.86 → 1755.86] The King of the Lamb's Prince, King of the Lamb's Prince, King of the Lamb's Prince.
[1755.86 → 1772.86] He's coming on the clouds, kings and kingdoms will bow down.
[1772.86 → 1777.86] He to kingdoms without doubt
[1777.86 → 1784.34] And every chain will break
[1784.34 → 1787.86] As broken hearts declare His praise
[1788.58 → 1792.60] For who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[1794.18 → 1799.18] Our God is a lion, the lion of Judah
[1799.18 → 1805.14] He is roaring with power and fighting our battles
[1805.14 → 1809.74] And every knee will bow before Him
[1809.74 → 1815.18] Our God is a lamb, the lamb that was slain
[1815.94 → 1821.54] For the sins of the Lord His blood breaks the chains
[1821.54 → 1827.10] And every knee will bow before the lion and the man
[1827.10 → 1831.94] And every knee will bow before Him
[1831.94 → 1845.24] So open up the gates
[1845.24 → 1849.10] Make way before the King of kings
[1849.10 → 1856.32] The God who comes to save
[1856.32 → 1860.26] Is here to set the captives free
[1860.26 → 1864.50] Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[1865.94 → 1871.10] Our God is a lion, the lion of Judah
[1871.10 → 1876.94] He is roaring with power and fighting our battles
[1876.94 → 1881.66] And every knee will bow before Him
[1881.66 → 1887.82] Our God is a lamb, the lamb that was slain
[1887.82 → 1893.10] For the sins of the Lord His blood breaks the chains
[1893.10 → 1897.94] And every knee will bow before Him
[1897.94 → 1901.94] And every knee will bow before Him
[1901.94 → 1903.44] And every knee will bow before Him
[1903.44 → 1926.28] Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[1926.28 → 1934.96] Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[1934.96 → 1936.04] Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[1936.04 → 1937.60] Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[1937.60 → 1943.40] Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[1943.40 → 1947.78] Who can stop the Lord?
[1947.78 → 1956.18] Our God is the Lion, the Lion of Judah
[1956.18 → 1961.82] He is roaring with power and fighting our battle
[1961.82 → 1966.58] Every knee will bow before Him
[1966.58 → 1972.58] Our God is the Lamb, the Lamb that will slay
[1972.58 → 1978.12] For the sins of the world, His blood breaks the chains
[1978.12 → 1983.62] Every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb
[1983.62 → 1988.40] Every knee will bow before Him
[2002.58 → 2016.58] Good morning, my name is Yap, I'm a deacon here at Langley Emanuel
[2016.58 → 2020.24] This morning's offering will be for the Langley Food Bank
[2020.24 → 2023.88] They're a non-profit organization
[2023.88 → 2029.82] Which is entirely funded through the support of local churches, businesses, and individuals
[2029.82 → 2032.88] Your donations are much appreciated
[2032.88 → 2034.68] If you want to give to the general budget
[2034.68 → 2038.90] You can use the envelopes in the seat in front of you
[2038.90 → 2040.16] Thank you
[2059.82 → 2072.76] There's a reason why the curse of sin is broken
[2072.76 → 2079.28] There's a reason why the darkness runs from light
[2079.28 → 2084.66] There's a reason why we stand here now forgiven
[2084.66 → 2087.36] Jesus is alive
[2087.36 → 2097.06] There's a reason why we are unovertaken
[2097.06 → 2102.82] There's a reason why we sing on through the night
[2102.82 → 2108.80] There's a reason why our hope remains eternal
[2108.80 → 2111.50] Jesus is alive
[2111.50 → 2123.20] Praise the King, He is risen
[2123.20 → 2126.96] Praise the King, He's alive
[2126.96 → 2135.20] Praise the King, destiny, heaven
[2135.20 → 2139.20] Hallelujah, He's alive
[2139.20 → 2142.86] Hallelujah, He's alive
[2142.86 → 2145.06] Hallelujah, He's alive
[2145.06 → 2150.90] There's a reason why our hearts can be released
[2150.90 → 2156.90] There's a reason why the dead are made alive
[2156.90 → 2162.90] There's a reason why we share His resurrection
[2162.90 → 2164.60] Jesus is alive
[2164.60 → 2172.60] Praise the King, He is risen
[2172.60 → 2174.60] Praise the King, He is risen
[2174.60 → 2176.60] Praise the King, He's alive
[2176.60 → 2180.60] Praise the King, He's alive
[2180.60 → 2183.60] Praise the King, death's defeated
[2183.60 → 2189.46] Praise the King, death's defeated
[2189.46 → 2193.30] Hallelujah, He is alive
[2193.30 → 2195.30] Hallelujah, He is alive
[2195.30 → 2199.30] Hallelujah, He is alive
[2199.30 → 2213.00] Praise the King, death's defeated
[2213.00 → 2215.94] The grave could not ignore it
[2215.94 → 2218.94] When all of heaven's roaring
[2218.94 → 2221.74] Now where is your victory?
[2222.22 → 2224.72] Death, where is your sting?
[2225.08 → 2227.88] The world could not ignore it
[2227.88 → 2231.08] When all the saints are roaring
[2231.08 → 2233.52] Now where is your victory?
[2233.52 → 2236.02] Death, where is your sting?
[2236.48 → 2239.74] The grave could not ignore it
[2239.74 → 2242.58] When all of heaven's roaring
[2242.58 → 2245.58] Hell, where is your victory?
[2246.06 → 2248.14] Death, where is your sting?
[2248.80 → 2251.68] The world cannot ignore it
[2251.68 → 2254.40] When all the saints are roaring
[2254.40 → 2257.30] Now where is your victory?
[2257.30 → 2261.14] death where is your sting
[2261.14 → 2267.46] praise the king
[2267.46 → 2270.48] he is risen
[2270.48 → 2272.78] praise the king
[2272.78 → 2274.52] he's alive
[2274.52 → 2278.94] praise the king
[2278.94 → 2281.70] death's defeated
[2281.70 → 2284.36] hallelujah
[2284.36 → 2286.40] he's alive
[2286.40 → 2290.00] hallelujah
[2290.00 → 2291.58] he's alive
[2291.58 → 2295.76] hallelujah
[2295.76 → 2297.84] he's alive
[2297.84 → 2312.38] good morning everyone
[2312.38 → 2314.64] I'd like to invite any of the kids to come up
[2314.64 → 2317.44] if you're age 3 all the way up to grade 4
[2317.44 → 2319.94] we're going to head off for children's worship time
[2319.94 → 2324.38] and then the K24s will come back to celebrate Lord's Supper
[2324.38 → 2343.26] so last week in children's worship time with Pastor Kevin you guys actually talked about Palm Sunday
[2343.26 → 2354.36] so with children's worship time every year for the grown-ups here we always run into this problem where there's a lot of content and not as many Sundays so we usually talk about Good Friday on Palm Sunday
[2354.36 → 2384.34] so that we can go over that important holiday and then next week we can focus on Easter Resurrection Sunday so they are well-prepared for Palm Sunday today I could see that thank you for helping show us what that would have looked like on back in Jesus's time waving all those branches, and today we're going to talk a little about how Jesus had to die first so that's going to be our topic today about how Jesus is our Saviour and that's before he died before he rose he died so
[2384.36 → 2395.70] because I have lots planned over there I just didn't plan a lot here today so we're going to just stand up right away and do the blessing, and then we'll have enough time to get everything done before we come back so standing up
[2395.70 → 2403.68] and do the plan
[2404.40 → 2406.50] and Trется
[2408.70 → 2413.42] and Long
[2415.56 → 2416.40] and
[2416.40 → 2416.68] and
[2416.68 → 2418.22] move
[2418.50 → 2418.80] all
[2418.80 → 2419.56] and
[2419.56 → 2447.10] Good morning.
[2447.10 → 2456.30] My name is Clary, and I'm an elder here, and it's my privilege to lead us in our congregational
[2456.30 → 2457.58] family prayer.
[2457.90 → 2460.58] So will you please join me in prayer?
[2462.56 → 2470.56] Father in heaven, it is once again perfect to be here gathered together.
[2470.56 → 2473.24] Father, thank you.
[2473.48 → 2482.14] Thank you for the beauty of this day, and thank you that we can celebrate Palm Sunday together
[2482.14 → 2488.66] and remember your story and our part in it.
[2488.66 → 2498.10] And today, Lord, like we always do, because it is good, we want to bring the concerns of
[2498.10 → 2499.62] our congregation to you.
[2500.08 → 2505.94] And of course, I've got a short list of six or seven things here, but we know with all
[2505.94 → 2512.32] of us here, seriously, we could come up with hundreds and hundreds of petitions.
[2513.18 → 2520.16] But right now, at this moment, we want to bring these, maybe our biggest praises and concerns
[2520.16 → 2521.36] to you.
[2522.44 → 2530.12] Father, we want to ask that you are with us as a congregation as we are going through our
[2530.12 → 2531.78] council nomination process.
[2531.78 → 2538.86] This is a thing we do every year, so on the one hand, it's kind of old news because it's
[2538.86 → 2547.50] not long ago we did last year's, but we ask, Father, that we may prayerfully consider those
[2547.50 → 2553.00] people in our congregation who have gifts and talents that would serve us well.
[2553.06 → 2558.78] And if we are one of those people who's asked, may we prayerfully consider.
[2558.78 → 2565.86] We want to give you thanks, Lord, that Matt Sharp underwent successful knee replacement
[2565.86 → 2568.70] surgery and is much improved.
[2569.08 → 2577.54] Father, we thank you for the gift of surgeons and the technology and the system that has so
[2577.54 → 2578.14] helped him out.
[2579.64 → 2586.36] We want to remember those members of our congregation, Lord, who are struggling with mental health
[2586.36 → 2586.96] challenges.
[2586.96 → 2598.00] We ask that you will surround them and, where it's fitting, use us, Lord, to bring peace,
[2599.20 → 2601.18] comfort, and healing.
[2602.26 → 2608.12] And we ask, Lord, that you will give them the confidence they need to hold tight to you,
[2608.12 → 2614.76] particularly those who have struggles every single day that may last for years.
[2614.76 → 2622.26] It can be exhausting and be with them.
[2623.50 → 2629.52] And, again, enable them to believe and hold tight.
[2629.52 → 2638.16] We thank you that Tessa is home from the hospital and seems to be responding well to treatments.
[2638.16 → 2642.90] Please grant her strength and endurance.
[2642.90 → 2654.34] And we ask, Lord, that you will continue to strengthen Doug and Tanya as they wrestle and
[2654.34 → 2656.24] endure stage four cancer.
[2656.24 → 2664.60] Will you continue to encourage and strengthen my sister, Joan, as she is in her fourth week
[2664.60 → 2667.34] of radiation for her cancer treatment?
[2667.88 → 2675.86] In these three cases, Lord, may the spring weather bring some revitalization to them.
[2676.58 → 2683.24] But may these three lean heavily in their confidence in you.
[2683.24 → 2691.64] For all of those, Lord, who struggle with private and unknown addictions in our midst, give them courage.
[2692.10 → 2694.02] Courage to talk to you.
[2695.12 → 2703.82] And, in particular, courage if their struggles are totally private, that they may talk to somebody
[2703.82 → 2705.52] and reach out and seek help.
[2705.52 → 2716.50] Finally, Lord, we know that so many of us gathered here this morning has experienced the pain of loss
[2716.50 → 2719.34] because of the death of someone we love.
[2720.18 → 2730.66] And we know that this morning here there will be many of us who feel the pain, feel the grief acutely.
[2730.66 → 2742.08] Will you please comfort them and encourage them with the promise and the confidence in the resurrection?
[2743.44 → 2744.12] Amen.
[2744.12 → 2744.22] Amen.
[2760.66 → 2777.54] Before I read our text for this morning, I just want to share with you, maybe, perhaps,
[2777.68 → 2785.52] the text that we're about to read is one of my favourite stories in the gospel accounts.
[2785.52 → 2788.80] And there are a number of reasons why that is the case.
[2789.02 → 2796.06] But, in particular, the line, even the stones would cry out.
[2797.24 → 2801.70] And I remember, I must have been in grade three or five or something.
[2802.34 → 2803.54] I was very young.
[2803.86 → 2805.26] I was at a Christian school.
[2805.62 → 2808.28] And in the Easter season, we did an assembly.
[2808.28 → 2812.72] And somebody read one of the teachers or someone, I don't even remember who,
[2812.80 → 2820.22] but somebody read a poem that was Palm Sunday from the perspective of the stone that would cry out.
[2820.78 → 2825.86] And ever since then, that text has come alive to me.
[2825.96 → 2829.28] This story has been experienced differently.
[2829.82 → 2831.98] And I share that with you for a couple of reasons.
[2831.98 → 2838.42] One, I hope you'll see that excitement, and you'll catch some of that in our time together this morning.
[2838.52 → 2845.52] But two, if you're a teacher, whether it's in school or in children's worship time or something like that,
[2845.80 → 2847.82] I hope you hear that as an encouragement.
[2848.80 → 2852.98] Because there was a season of my life where if you had looked at it, you would not have thought,
[2853.10 → 2856.86] man, that guy's a Christian, let alone he's going to be a pastor later on.
[2856.86 → 2864.04] But that moment, however old you are in grade three, it was nine, something like that,
[2864.26 → 2866.24] that moment stuck with me forever.
[2867.10 → 2868.36] So the work you do is really important.
[2869.02 → 2872.80] And so I just want to thank you for doing that work and for being faithful in that.
[2873.50 → 2880.52] And hopefully, somewhere, someone has a similar story because of what you have done in their life.
[2880.84 → 2884.68] And, so please be encouraged as we come into this text.
[2884.68 → 2891.78] And then for all of us, hopefully, you can be excited and see what we are going to share.
[2892.24 → 2895.90] Now, I'm going to read this story.
[2896.14 → 2900.16] And I think on the screen behind me, we're going to pick it up at verse 40.
[2900.44 → 2904.74] But I'm going to start at verse 37 just to give us context in there.
[2904.92 → 2908.22] And so, Tara, when I hit verse 40, then we can go through.
[2908.22 → 2915.96] So this is from Luke 19, starting at verse 37.
[2915.96 → 2941.60] And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus,
[2941.60 → 2962.12] And as he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it and said,
[2962.12 → 2968.28] If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace,
[2968.70 → 2970.64] but now it is hidden from your eyes.
[2971.24 → 2975.48] The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you
[2975.48 → 2978.52] and encircle you and hem you in on every side.
[2978.80 → 2982.88] They will dash you to the ground and you and the children within your walls.
[2983.24 → 2986.08] They will not leave one stone on another
[2986.08 → 2991.22] because you did not recognize the time of God's coming to you.
[2992.16 → 2993.60] This is the word of the Lord.
[2997.78 → 3003.24] So why don't you want us to dig into this juxtaposition in the text?
[3003.74 → 3003.98] Right?
[3004.02 → 3006.32] You've got stones that would cry out,
[3007.38 → 3010.08] but then the people didn't realize,
[3010.88 → 3015.52] Jerusalem doesn't realize who it is in front of them.
[3016.08 → 3017.74] And so Jesus weeps.
[3018.66 → 3021.06] You have a group of disciples who are singing his praises
[3021.06 → 3024.72] and who are recognizing something about this man,
[3025.30 → 3027.74] but what is it that they're longing for,
[3027.82 → 3030.76] that they're clinging to, that they're hoping for?
[3031.48 → 3036.62] And then you have a whole generation of people who just didn't get it.
[3038.24 → 3041.98] Our big idea this morning is that even the stones would cry out,
[3041.98 → 3045.60] but the people didn't recognize who was in front of them.
[3046.08 → 3048.72] And then the application,
[3049.22 → 3051.40] let's not make the same mistake.
[3053.40 → 3054.80] Now this is a story,
[3055.04 → 3057.04] we've already mentioned it this morning,
[3057.38 → 3060.06] that's often called the triumphal entry.
[3060.48 → 3060.80] Right?
[3060.84 → 3062.66] Because of the procession of Jesus
[3062.66 → 3065.46] and the crowds of people heralding his coming.
[3065.80 → 3065.92] Right?
[3065.98 → 3066.32] They say,
[3066.42 → 3069.68] blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord.
[3069.68 → 3072.14] which we know,
[3072.40 → 3075.00] and Jackie used it as our call to worship this morning,
[3075.00 → 3080.08] is a quote that comes from Psalm 118, verse 26.
[3081.36 → 3084.32] Now Psalm 118 also says,
[3084.32 → 3088.52] the stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.
[3089.58 → 3092.06] Psalm 118 also says,
[3092.42 → 3097.20] the Lord is God, and he has made his light shine on us with bows in hand,
[3097.60 → 3101.28] join the festal procession up to the horns of the altar.
[3101.28 → 3104.26] And what you can hear in that,
[3104.32 → 3104.90] I hope,
[3105.00 → 3105.62] and see,
[3105.96 → 3106.78] Lord willing,
[3106.92 → 3111.32] very clearly that this is a kingship psalm.
[3111.54 → 3113.90] It's a sort of inauguration hymn.
[3114.62 → 3116.26] When the king comes to town,
[3116.42 → 3118.02] this is what is played.
[3118.92 → 3119.64] And in fact,
[3120.02 → 3120.62] Luke,
[3120.74 → 3123.42] when he quotes this psalm in our text,
[3123.42 → 3126.02] in verse 38,
[3126.32 → 3127.76] when he quotes this psalm,
[3127.84 → 3130.96] he adds the word king in his quote
[3130.96 → 3136.54] in order to make sure that the primarily Greek readers of his gospel,
[3136.82 → 3140.68] who might not know Psalm 118 as an inauguration hymn,
[3140.78 → 3142.26] as a kingship psalm,
[3142.48 → 3144.02] that they don't miss that point.
[3144.74 → 3147.52] That this is the king coming to his people.
[3147.60 → 3149.30] This is the rightful king.
[3149.30 → 3150.96] In fact,
[3151.12 → 3153.58] when Matthew and Mark tell this story,
[3154.26 → 3156.60] they remember the people shouting,
[3157.00 → 3158.70] Hosanna to the son of David.
[3159.30 → 3161.02] They remember the people shouting,
[3161.24 → 3164.86] Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father, David.
[3165.92 → 3168.02] If you are familiar with the Bible story,
[3168.16 → 3171.06] David is the great king of Israel,
[3171.24 → 3173.38] from whose line the Messiah king,
[3173.50 → 3174.36] the last king,
[3174.66 → 3176.62] the true and better king would come.
[3176.62 → 3179.50] He was promised an everlasting kingdom.
[3181.40 → 3181.92] And so,
[3182.26 → 3183.22] to be sure,
[3183.52 → 3187.46] for the people to be proclaiming this of Jesus
[3187.46 → 3190.68] as he marches into Jerusalem,
[3191.20 → 3194.50] don't miss how controversial this is.
[3195.60 → 3198.50] This is actually insurrection language.
[3199.84 → 3203.88] This is a people who are under the rule and reign of Rome,
[3203.88 → 3204.58] saying,
[3204.58 → 3205.70] not Caesar,
[3206.12 → 3207.24] but our guy.
[3209.50 → 3213.18] This is a people hoping that Jesus might gather armies
[3213.18 → 3216.34] and that he might somehow topple Roman oppression.
[3217.88 → 3220.34] And the Pharisees in this story,
[3220.72 → 3221.90] give them a little bit of credit.
[3222.08 → 3223.08] They knew what it meant.
[3224.82 → 3225.28] Remember,
[3226.06 → 3227.10] the Pharisees,
[3227.28 → 3228.94] along with the Sadducee's,
[3229.04 → 3230.22] which is their sort of counterpart,
[3230.94 → 3231.36] together,
[3231.36 → 3233.26] they make up the Sanhedrin.
[3233.26 → 3234.20] Now,
[3234.24 → 3238.98] the Sanhedrin is sort of a tenuously cobbled together
[3238.98 → 3240.86] religion-political alliance
[3241.52 → 3243.88] of leaders within the Jewish people.
[3244.62 → 3247.70] And they have a carefully crafted agreement
[3247.70 → 3249.18] with Rome,
[3249.32 → 3251.36] through her governors and proconsuls,
[3251.46 → 3252.58] and through her puppet kings,
[3252.84 → 3253.88] like Herod Agrippa.
[3253.88 → 3255.48] Right?
[3255.54 → 3257.66] And it's a carefully grafted,
[3257.86 → 3258.84] tenuous agreement
[3258.84 → 3263.00] that's really balanced on the tip of a ladies,
[3263.20 → 3264.68] a Roman soldier's sword.
[3264.68 → 3268.96] And this agreement allows them the opportunity
[3268.96 → 3270.68] to keep worshipping in the way
[3270.68 → 3272.68] that they had historically and previously,
[3272.68 → 3274.32] to have their own temple mount,
[3274.40 → 3276.02] and to not have temples
[3276.02 → 3279.56] and temples to other gods
[3279.56 → 3282.18] or to Caesar within the city of Jerusalem.
[3282.90 → 3286.34] But the Pharisees hear what these people are saying,
[3286.78 → 3288.28] and they hiss at Jesus,
[3288.28 → 3289.06] Jesus, teacher,
[3289.42 → 3290.42] shut them up!
[3291.46 → 3292.86] You're going to get us killed!
[3294.12 → 3294.42] Right?
[3294.46 → 3296.56] This isn't just going to upset the status quo.
[3296.86 → 3298.50] This is going to topple the piece,
[3298.84 → 3301.54] this carefully crafted arrangement that we have.
[3303.60 → 3305.08] But they're missing something.
[3305.46 → 3305.72] Right?
[3306.30 → 3308.16] They're missing something about Jesus,
[3308.40 → 3310.88] missing something about the nature of His kingdom.
[3310.88 → 3314.20] And this is the part that I want us to see for a moment.
[3314.86 → 3316.42] To see it, we have to go back.
[3318.18 → 3323.58] There's a story that's told in 1 Kings 1.
[3324.22 → 3327.30] It's a story about the transition of power
[3327.30 → 3330.68] from King David to one of his sons, Solomon.
[3331.96 → 3335.88] David tells the priest and the prophet
[3335.88 → 3340.22] to take Solomon outside the city of Jerusalem,
[3340.22 → 3342.40] down to the Gijon Spring.
[3343.42 → 3345.64] Now, the Gijon Spring is in the valley
[3345.64 → 3347.90] that sits between the Mount of Olives
[3347.90 → 3349.84] and the mount where the Jerusalem is on,
[3350.34 → 3352.50] down below there,
[3352.62 → 3354.84] outside the old city of David in Jerusalem.
[3355.90 → 3358.94] And David says to the priest and to the prophet,
[3359.32 → 3363.56] anoint my son and have him ride a donkey
[3363.56 → 3366.30] to come back into the city.
[3367.10 → 3368.62] Blow the horn and shout,
[3368.62 → 3370.42] long live King Solomon.
[3371.44 → 3373.00] And as the story goes, as you read it,
[3373.04 → 3373.76] that's what happens.
[3374.18 → 3376.06] Solomon rides in on a donkey
[3376.06 → 3378.46] and the people shout his praises.
[3379.44 → 3380.58] Now, this is important.
[3381.32 → 3383.98] For those of you who have been around for a little while,
[3384.24 → 3387.12] what is David known for as king?
[3388.50 → 3390.98] What's the refrain that makes David so popular?
[3393.22 → 3393.70] Sorry?
[3394.90 → 3395.82] Heart after God.
[3395.82 → 3396.98] A man after God's own heart.
[3397.06 → 3397.46] Thank you.
[3397.96 → 3399.38] I think I heard someone say 10,000.
[3399.48 → 3400.72] We'll come back to that in just a second.
[3402.02 → 3402.26] Right?
[3402.28 → 3403.96] This is a man after God's own heart.
[3404.16 → 3407.48] And yes, God promised him an everlasting kingdom.
[3408.02 → 3408.14] Right?
[3408.18 → 3410.64] But maybe you also remember the refrain,
[3411.10 → 3413.42] Saul killed his thousands and David his...
[3413.42 → 3413.64] Ken?
[3414.56 → 3415.50] Tens of thousands.
[3415.64 → 3416.12] That's right.
[3417.28 → 3417.44] Right?
[3417.44 → 3419.08] In 2 Samuel 12,
[3419.20 → 3420.90] the prophet Nathan tells David,
[3421.26 → 3423.44] the sword will never depart from you.
[3425.22 → 3426.82] And so for all the good things
[3426.82 → 3427.80] that we know about David,
[3428.70 → 3430.44] he was known for his sword.
[3431.76 → 3431.96] Right?
[3432.00 → 3432.42] That phrase,
[3432.52 → 3433.46] those who live by the sword
[3433.46 → 3434.36] will die by the sword,
[3434.40 → 3435.90] that comes from the story of David.
[3437.12 → 3438.08] Now, what about Solomon?
[3438.18 → 3439.16] What do we know about Solomon?
[3440.16 → 3440.58] Anyone?
[3441.94 → 3442.38] Wives.
[3442.60 → 3443.06] That's right.
[3443.44 → 3445.42] We remember some pretty bad things about Solomon.
[3445.42 → 3448.76] And he had over 700 wives, 300 concubines.
[3448.86 → 3449.42] In that way,
[3449.50 → 3450.84] he was exactly the same
[3450.84 → 3453.30] as the king of every other nation around them.
[3453.32 → 3455.00] And Israel was supposed to be different.
[3456.30 → 3456.66] Right?
[3456.78 → 3457.12] God said,
[3457.26 → 3458.64] do not be like the other nations.
[3458.70 → 3460.16] And that's why he didn't want them to have a king.
[3460.22 → 3461.20] But then he gave in to them.
[3461.42 → 3462.76] And then they ended up having kings
[3462.76 → 3465.40] that were just like all the other kings.
[3466.44 → 3467.70] Now, Solomon's also remembered
[3467.70 → 3469.44] for worshipping the wives,
[3469.70 → 3471.80] or worshipping the gods of his wives.
[3472.24 → 3473.22] Probably his wives too.
[3473.22 → 3475.90] One of the gods that we read
[3475.90 → 3476.64] that he worshipped
[3476.64 → 3477.76] was Ashtoreth,
[3477.88 → 3478.90] which is a Phoenician
[3478.90 → 3481.20] and Canaanite fertility goddess.
[3482.84 → 3484.26] There are some scholars
[3484.26 → 3486.04] who say that the Greek analog
[3486.04 → 3487.56] that you might know is Aphrodite,
[3488.00 → 3490.54] so goddess of promiscuity and the like.
[3491.96 → 3494.64] We also know that Solomon worshipped Moloch,
[3495.14 → 3496.54] which is an Ammonite god
[3496.54 → 3498.22] associated with child sacrifice.
[3498.22 → 3503.14] But Solomon's also known
[3503.14 → 3504.94] for his humility
[3504.94 → 3506.80] and his wisdom.
[3508.02 → 3508.42] Right?
[3508.48 → 3509.72] The beginning of Solomon's story
[3509.72 → 3511.66] is that the Lord gave him a chance
[3511.66 → 3512.84] to ask for anything.
[3513.50 → 3513.64] He said,
[3513.72 → 3514.40] ask me anything
[3514.40 → 3515.50] and I will give it to you.
[3515.78 → 3517.14] Riches, power, whatever.
[3517.66 → 3521.06] And Solomon asked for wisdom.
[3521.70 → 3523.56] He asked for godly wisdom.
[3523.56 → 3525.68] When the opportunity to serve
[3525.68 → 3527.08] and to lead was in front of him,
[3527.36 → 3527.82] he said,
[3527.94 → 3529.16] I can't do this.
[3529.60 → 3530.92] I need God's help.
[3532.08 → 3533.12] So he humbled himself
[3533.12 → 3533.66] and he said,
[3534.16 → 3535.06] give me your wisdom.
[3537.42 → 3539.02] Wisdom and humility
[3539.02 → 3542.52] are a mark of Solomon's rule.
[3543.16 → 3544.72] Now, in this story
[3544.72 → 3546.08] from 1 Kings 1
[3546.08 → 3548.26] about Solomon entering the city
[3548.26 → 3549.84] after he is anointed king,
[3549.84 → 3551.86] the people walk before him
[3551.86 → 3552.66] and around him
[3552.66 → 3553.42] and behind him.
[3553.52 → 3554.06] They're shouting.
[3554.22 → 3555.24] They're blowing trumpets.
[3555.64 → 3556.76] They're playing pipes,
[3556.98 → 3557.34] we read.
[3557.56 → 3558.08] And they say,
[3558.18 → 3559.12] long live the king.
[3560.00 → 3561.96] They're singing joyfully
[3561.96 → 3563.20] and rejoicing
[3563.20 → 3565.74] that their new king has come.
[3565.84 → 3567.84] And then in 1 Kings 1 verse 40,
[3567.98 → 3568.38] we read,
[3568.78 → 3569.96] they're so loud
[3569.96 → 3572.06] that the ground shook
[3572.06 → 3573.12] with the sound.
[3574.86 → 3576.92] The ground shook with the sound.
[3577.84 → 3578.04] Now,
[3578.04 → 3579.60] here's something cool,
[3579.72 → 3579.88] okay?
[3580.22 → 3581.50] The Greek translation
[3581.50 → 3582.64] of the Old Testament,
[3583.18 → 3584.52] which is called the Septuagint,
[3584.60 → 3585.24] it's the Bible
[3585.24 → 3587.08] that most of the Jews
[3587.08 → 3587.94] of Jesus' day
[3587.94 → 3589.36] would have been familiar with.
[3589.78 → 3590.84] The Greek translation
[3590.84 → 3591.84] of the Old Testament
[3591.84 → 3594.18] translates 1 Kings 1 verse 40
[3594.18 → 3595.16] by saying,
[3595.54 → 3597.08] the ground broke forth
[3597.08 → 3598.22] with its voice.
[3602.02 → 3603.88] Even the stones
[3603.88 → 3605.54] will cry out.
[3605.54 → 3609.76] Riding into the city
[3609.76 → 3610.52] on a donkey
[3610.52 → 3611.42] like Solomon
[3611.42 → 3612.66] makes Jesus
[3612.66 → 3613.82] and his kingdom
[3613.82 → 3615.20] more about humility
[3615.20 → 3616.30] and wisdom
[3616.30 → 3617.50] than the sword.
[3618.54 → 3619.68] He's a different kind
[3619.68 → 3620.56] of king.
[3620.88 → 3621.82] And Jesus is coming
[3621.82 → 3622.30] as king,
[3622.40 → 3622.90] to be sure,
[3623.00 → 3623.96] but not as a king
[3623.96 → 3625.32] interested in the things
[3625.32 → 3625.86] of Rome.
[3626.72 → 3628.64] This isn't a triumphal entry
[3628.64 → 3629.98] of a warrior king.
[3629.98 → 3631.14] This is a kingdom
[3631.14 → 3631.90] that is marked
[3631.90 → 3632.68] by humility
[3632.68 → 3633.98] and wisdom.
[3634.96 → 3636.16] One Bible scholar
[3636.16 → 3637.28] named Brent Kinsman
[3637.28 → 3639.54] actually calls this story
[3639.54 → 3641.10] not the triumphal entry,
[3641.56 → 3641.98] but the
[3641.98 → 3643.64] ah-triumphal entry.
[3644.34 → 3644.78] Right?
[3644.84 → 3646.08] Using the alpha privative
[3646.08 → 3646.92] because it's an
[3646.92 → 3648.14] atypical example
[3648.14 → 3650.32] of what goes on here.
[3651.32 → 3651.86] Right?
[3651.88 → 3652.98] An ah-triumphal entry
[3653.62 → 3654.92] because it's revealing
[3654.92 → 3656.86] exactly the kind
[3656.86 → 3657.38] of king
[3657.38 → 3658.32] that Jesus
[3658.32 → 3659.34] is.
[3660.66 → 3661.40] And some people
[3661.40 → 3661.96] saw it.
[3662.76 → 3663.62] Maybe even some
[3663.62 → 3664.36] understood it.
[3664.84 → 3665.96] But many didn't.
[3666.74 → 3667.76] Many didn't see it.
[3668.38 → 3668.96] They didn't get
[3668.96 → 3669.82] what was going on.
[3670.04 → 3670.72] And some of them
[3670.72 → 3671.82] just downright
[3671.82 → 3673.12] rejected it.
[3674.46 → 3675.68] The Pharisees,
[3675.72 → 3676.68] who knew their Bibles
[3676.68 → 3677.96] better than anyone else,
[3678.48 → 3679.58] didn't see it.
[3680.34 → 3681.50] They didn't see Jesus
[3681.50 → 3682.38] for who he is.
[3683.70 → 3684.46] And what about people
[3684.46 → 3685.56] who don't read their Bibles?
[3686.42 → 3687.38] How will they see it?
[3687.68 → 3689.08] How will they hear of him?
[3689.40 → 3691.10] How will people know
[3691.10 → 3692.74] who this man is?
[3694.72 → 3694.92] Right?
[3695.12 → 3696.98] People look at Jesus
[3696.98 → 3698.58] and they think they know.
[3699.70 → 3700.66] But do they?
[3704.18 → 3705.14] And that question
[3705.14 → 3706.42] is worth asking today.
[3707.28 → 3707.76] Right?
[3708.44 → 3709.34] Because people continue
[3709.34 → 3710.18] to look at Jesus
[3710.18 → 3711.42] and think they know.
[3712.50 → 3713.46] But do they?
[3714.48 → 3715.48] We're living in a time
[3715.48 → 3715.98] and place
[3715.98 → 3716.94] that is very much
[3716.94 → 3717.74] the same.
[3719.38 → 3720.70] People look at Jesus
[3720.70 → 3722.10] and they think they know.
[3722.26 → 3723.70] Or people look at Jesus
[3723.70 → 3724.84] and they see a stranger.
[3725.40 → 3726.44] They've got no idea.
[3728.62 → 3729.14] Quickly,
[3729.26 → 3730.04] I want to paint
[3730.04 → 3730.60] a picture
[3730.60 → 3731.80] for you here.
[3733.42 → 3735.38] There's a research
[3735.38 → 3736.18] institution
[3736.18 → 3737.86] in Hamilton,
[3738.60 → 3739.10] Ontario.
[3739.30 → 3739.68] I'm sorry,
[3739.80 → 3740.44] it's from Ontario.
[3740.60 → 3741.32] They're not all bad.
[3741.50 → 3743.64] but named
[3743.64 → 3744.28] Cards.
[3745.36 → 3746.14] They're a research
[3746.14 → 3746.68] institution
[3746.68 → 3747.80] and a think tank
[3747.80 → 3748.80] run by
[3748.80 → 3750.86] a Christian group
[3750.86 → 3752.52] and they published
[3752.52 → 3753.18] a study
[3753.18 → 3754.16] recently
[3754.16 → 3755.30] on religious
[3755.30 → 3756.20] identity
[3756.20 → 3757.18] in Canada.
[3757.18 → 3757.30] Canada.
[3758.30 → 3759.06] And I want to note
[3759.06 → 3759.88] some of the findings
[3759.88 → 3760.74] that they have there.
[3762.10 → 3763.14] In 2018,
[3764.18 → 3765.34] 24%
[3765.34 → 3766.42] of Canadians
[3766.42 → 3767.36] attended
[3767.36 → 3768.86] religious services
[3768.86 → 3770.18] once a month.
[3771.18 → 3772.02] And that's not
[3772.02 → 3772.68] counting weddings
[3772.68 → 3773.42] and funerals.
[3774.46 → 3775.38] But that is
[3775.38 → 3776.48] religious services
[3776.48 → 3777.26] so it's not just
[3777.26 → 3777.70] Christian.
[3778.30 → 3778.92] So hear that.
[3778.92 → 3781.06] in 2022,
[3781.70 → 3782.62] that number
[3782.62 → 3784.34] is down to 15%.
[3784.34 → 3786.38] From 24
[3786.38 → 3787.54] to 15.
[3788.62 → 3789.50] In 2022,
[3789.88 → 3790.80] of those who identify
[3790.80 → 3791.76] as Christian,
[3792.48 → 3792.76] now,
[3792.94 → 3794.00] so focusing in
[3794.00 → 3795.20] on our group,
[3795.56 → 3795.94] 2022,
[3796.26 → 3797.00] of those who identify
[3797.00 → 3797.60] as Christian,
[3797.84 → 3799.74] only 15%
[3799.74 → 3801.56] attend weekly worship.
[3801.56 → 3804.34] or to put it
[3804.34 → 3804.74] another way,
[3804.82 → 3805.74] of those who identify
[3805.74 → 3806.34] as Christian,
[3806.76 → 3808.32] only 18%
[3808.32 → 3809.78] read their Bibles
[3809.78 → 3811.46] at least once a month.
[3814.04 → 3814.88] Less than
[3814.88 → 3816.30] one in five people
[3816.30 → 3817.04] in Canada
[3817.04 → 3818.48] who say they are Christian
[3818.48 → 3819.70] read their Bibles
[3819.70 → 3820.56] and go to church
[3820.56 → 3821.10] regularly.
[3823.30 → 3824.62] People look at Jesus
[3824.62 → 3825.44] and they think
[3825.44 → 3825.92] they know.
[3827.28 → 3828.38] But how can they?
[3830.80 → 3831.00] Right?
[3831.00 → 3832.08] Even the Christians
[3832.08 → 3833.98] barely seem to know.
[3835.12 → 3836.02] Even the Christians
[3836.02 → 3838.50] barely seem to open
[3838.50 → 3839.70] our own book
[3839.70 → 3840.44] and attend
[3840.44 → 3841.68] our own worship
[3841.68 → 3842.84] and know
[3842.84 → 3843.88] who this
[3843.88 → 3845.12] Jesus is.
[3847.96 → 3849.02] And yet,
[3849.42 → 3851.42] and yet,
[3851.78 → 3852.08] Jesus
[3852.08 → 3853.54] will be
[3853.54 → 3854.70] worshipped.
[3855.96 → 3856.92] Jesus will be
[3856.92 → 3857.54] acknowledged.
[3857.66 → 3858.56] Look back at the story.
[3858.98 → 3859.64] The Pharisees
[3859.64 → 3860.16] complain
[3860.16 → 3861.42] and tell Jesus
[3861.42 → 3862.06] to quiet
[3862.06 → 3862.86] his disciples
[3862.86 → 3864.12] and he responds
[3864.12 → 3864.58] with the most
[3864.58 → 3865.40] beautiful phrase
[3865.40 → 3866.10] and this is the one
[3866.10 → 3866.64] that has stuck
[3866.64 → 3867.28] with me forever.
[3867.62 → 3868.18] I tell you,
[3868.30 → 3869.34] if they keep quiet,
[3869.60 → 3870.48] the stones
[3870.48 → 3871.68] will cry out.
[3872.68 → 3873.30] The ground
[3873.30 → 3874.58] will burst forth
[3874.58 → 3875.52] with its voice.
[3876.08 → 3876.38] Jesus
[3876.38 → 3877.44] will be praised.
[3877.58 → 3878.28] All creation
[3878.28 → 3879.20] proclaims your
[3879.20 → 3879.76] handiwork.
[3879.88 → 3880.68] Day after day,
[3881.02 → 3881.76] night after night,
[3881.82 → 3882.82] it pours forth
[3882.82 → 3883.46] speech
[3883.46 → 3884.32] and reveals
[3884.32 → 3885.72] its creator.
[3886.36 → 3887.10] If the people
[3887.10 → 3887.62] don't,
[3888.22 → 3888.76] the rocks
[3888.76 → 3889.10] will.
[3892.78 → 3893.44] But are you
[3893.44 → 3893.76] going to let
[3893.76 → 3894.34] rocks steal
[3894.34 → 3895.16] your purpose?
[3896.86 → 3897.20] Are you going
[3897.20 → 3898.08] to give to a rock
[3898.08 → 3898.62] what you were
[3898.62 → 3899.50] created to do?
[3900.00 → 3901.10] You were meant
[3901.10 → 3901.80] to sing
[3901.80 → 3902.46] his praises.
[3902.62 → 3903.36] You were made
[3903.36 → 3904.46] to worship God.
[3904.56 → 3905.38] You were created
[3905.38 → 3906.34] to pour forth
[3906.34 → 3907.16] praise
[3907.16 → 3908.52] of this Jesus.
[3908.52 → 3913.36] Let me say it
[3913.36 → 3913.66] again.
[3914.66 → 3915.32] People look
[3915.32 → 3915.80] at Jesus
[3915.80 → 3916.86] and they think
[3916.86 → 3917.46] they know.
[3918.86 → 3919.84] How many of you
[3919.84 → 3921.18] have kind of
[3921.18 → 3922.06] felt meh
[3922.06 → 3923.30] when it comes
[3923.30 → 3923.74] to Jesus?
[3925.76 → 3926.98] How many of you
[3926.98 → 3927.76] know people
[3927.76 → 3928.68] or perhaps you
[3928.68 → 3929.90] are here today
[3929.90 → 3931.22] who haven't
[3931.22 → 3931.88] really ever
[3931.88 → 3932.52] given Jesus
[3932.52 → 3933.26] a second thought
[3933.26 → 3934.20] before this moment
[3934.20 → 3934.64] right now
[3934.64 → 3935.48] when I'm asking you?
[3936.90 → 3937.50] Or how many
[3937.50 → 3938.48] people do you know
[3938.48 → 3938.84] and again
[3938.84 → 3939.38] perhaps you're
[3939.38 → 3940.10] sitting here today
[3940.10 → 3941.38] who know
[3941.38 → 3942.70] about Jesus
[3942.70 → 3943.80] but who don't
[3943.80 → 3944.70] know Jesus?
[3944.98 → 3945.32] You know the
[3945.32 → 3945.94] distinction I'm
[3945.94 → 3946.42] making there?
[3947.48 → 3947.72] Right?
[3947.76 → 3948.22] When you've got
[3948.22 → 3948.78] an awareness
[3948.78 → 3949.58] a head knowledge
[3949.58 → 3950.10] of something
[3950.10 → 3950.54] but you don't
[3950.54 → 3952.28] hold it
[3952.28 → 3953.56] you don't feel it
[3953.56 → 3954.06] it doesn't mean
[3954.06 → 3954.46] anything
[3954.46 → 3955.68] it's just an idea
[3955.68 → 3956.32] that you carry
[3956.32 → 3956.92] like you would
[3956.92 → 3957.66] that two plus two
[3957.66 → 3958.34] equals four
[3958.34 → 3961.48] takes a special
[3961.48 → 3962.62] person to get joy
[3962.62 → 3963.54] out of two plus two
[3963.54 → 3964.20] equals four
[3964.20 → 3966.14] but dig deep
[3966.14 → 3967.72] into the complications
[3967.72 → 3968.50] and the beauty
[3968.50 → 3969.20] and the majesty
[3969.20 → 3969.74] of math
[3969.74 → 3970.08] and all of a sudden
[3970.08 → 3970.92] you start to find joy
[3970.92 → 3972.38] same thing with Jesus
[3972.38 → 3973.28] you can kind of
[3973.28 → 3973.60] know him
[3973.60 → 3973.96] and be like
[3973.96 → 3974.38] yeah alright
[3974.38 → 3975.62] but dig deep
[3975.62 → 3976.52] go down
[3976.52 → 3977.64] go further in
[3977.64 → 3978.44] and see
[3978.44 → 3979.38] what it is
[3979.38 → 3979.92] that you were
[3979.92 → 3981.84] created for
[3981.84 → 3984.60] Jesus longs
[3984.60 → 3985.74] to be known
[3985.74 → 3987.18] and the fact
[3987.18 → 3988.20] that so many people
[3988.20 → 3989.42] think they know him
[3989.42 → 3990.72] but don't actually
[3990.72 → 3991.42] know him
[3991.42 → 3992.82] makes him
[3992.82 → 3993.74] weep
[3993.74 → 3996.70] as he approached
[3996.70 → 3997.40] Jerusalem
[3997.40 → 3999.34] he saw the city
[3999.34 → 4000.98] and he wept
[4000.98 → 4002.52] over it
[4002.52 → 4005.30] looking at the city
[4005.30 → 4005.90] and through
[4005.90 → 4007.22] his tears
[4007.22 → 4008.20] Jesus says
[4008.20 → 4009.94] if you
[4009.94 → 4011.68] even you
[4011.68 → 4012.64] had only
[4012.64 → 4013.24] known
[4013.24 → 4015.18] that on this day
[4015.18 → 4015.88] what it is
[4015.88 → 4016.62] that would bring you
[4016.62 → 4017.06] peace
[4017.06 → 4018.54] who would bring you
[4018.54 → 4019.04] peace
[4019.04 → 4020.88] but now it's
[4020.88 → 4021.70] hidden from your eyes
[4021.70 → 4024.02] so the days
[4024.02 → 4024.66] will come
[4024.66 → 4026.68] will come upon you
[4026.68 → 4027.38] when your enemies
[4027.38 → 4028.60] will build an embankment
[4028.60 → 4029.24] against you
[4029.24 → 4030.30] and encircle you
[4030.30 → 4031.08] and hem you in
[4031.08 → 4031.88] on every side
[4031.88 → 4033.02] and they will dash you
[4033.02 → 4033.68] to the ground
[4033.68 → 4035.04] and you and the children
[4035.04 → 4035.76] within your walls
[4035.76 → 4036.76] and they will not leave
[4036.76 → 4038.10] one stone on another
[4038.10 → 4039.10] because you did not
[4039.10 → 4040.34] recognize the time
[4040.34 → 4041.62] of God's coming
[4041.62 → 4042.68] to you
[4042.68 → 4045.50] if you had only known
[4045.50 → 4047.14] if you'd only known
[4047.14 → 4048.22] what would bring you peace
[4048.22 → 4048.94] and then Jesus
[4048.94 → 4050.14] goes on to describe
[4050.14 → 4051.30] an event
[4051.30 → 4052.42] that is likely
[4052.42 → 4053.48] fulfilled in
[4053.48 → 4054.52] AD 70
[4054.52 → 4056.14] by the destruction
[4056.14 → 4056.96] of Jerusalem
[4056.96 → 4057.74] at the hands
[4057.74 → 4058.34] of the Romans
[4058.34 → 4060.74] now this destruction
[4060.74 → 4061.46] of Jerusalem
[4061.46 → 4063.18] is described
[4063.18 → 4065.52] by historians
[4065.52 → 4066.66] Josephus
[4066.66 → 4067.44] and Tacitus
[4067.44 → 4068.34] and Suetonius
[4068.34 → 4069.60] the last two
[4069.60 → 4070.52] Roman historians
[4070.52 → 4071.20] the first one
[4071.20 → 4071.98] a Jewish historian
[4071.98 → 4073.62] who worked for Rome
[4073.62 → 4074.58] they describe
[4074.58 → 4075.46] the destruction
[4075.46 → 4076.20] of Jerusalem
[4076.20 → 4077.96] as raising
[4077.96 → 4078.94] a mountaintop
[4078.94 → 4079.44] flat
[4079.44 → 4081.46] Josephus
[4081.46 → 4082.04] says that their
[4082.04 → 4082.50] destruction
[4082.50 → 4083.66] was so thorough
[4083.66 → 4084.78] that the people
[4084.78 → 4085.86] who came to the city
[4085.86 → 4086.84] in the generations
[4086.84 → 4087.40] afterwards
[4087.40 → 4088.56] were unable to tell
[4088.56 → 4088.94] that anyone
[4088.94 → 4089.68] had lived there
[4089.68 → 4091.68] in fact
[4091.68 → 4092.42] as Suetonius
[4092.42 → 4093.02] describes it
[4093.02 → 4093.56] the only thing
[4093.56 → 4094.22] left was a
[4094.22 → 4095.08] garrison tower
[4095.08 → 4096.62] and it was probably
[4096.62 → 4097.60] left as a marker
[4097.60 → 4098.82] of the absolute
[4098.82 → 4099.42] destruction
[4099.42 → 4101.44] they will not
[4101.44 → 4102.60] leave one stone
[4102.60 → 4103.36] on another
[4103.36 → 4104.08] said Jesus
[4104.08 → 4104.76] because you
[4104.76 → 4105.72] did not recognize
[4105.72 → 4106.42] the time
[4106.42 → 4107.44] of God's coming
[4107.44 → 4107.90] to you
[4107.90 → 4109.38] that's what
[4109.38 → 4109.84] happened
[4109.84 → 4116.52] in 2018
[4116.52 → 4118.50] I went
[4118.50 → 4119.38] to
[4119.38 → 4120.40] Egypt
[4120.40 → 4121.12] and Israel
[4121.12 → 4122.20] and Jordan
[4122.20 → 4123.94] and on one day
[4123.94 → 4124.66] I think I've told
[4124.66 → 4125.12] some of you
[4125.12 → 4126.08] this story before
[4126.08 → 4127.32] one day
[4127.32 → 4127.82] we were
[4127.82 → 4129.30] standing on top
[4129.30 → 4129.82] of the Mount
[4129.82 → 4130.36] of Olives
[4130.36 → 4132.12] which is now
[4132.12 → 4133.26] a cemetery
[4133.26 → 4134.90] a Muslim cemetery
[4134.90 → 4135.62] there's a small
[4135.62 → 4136.36] Jewish quarter
[4136.36 → 4137.72] for graves
[4137.72 → 4138.62] there
[4138.62 → 4139.86] we got special
[4139.86 → 4140.24] permission
[4140.24 → 4141.24] from the gardener
[4141.24 → 4142.56] to let us come in
[4142.56 → 4143.54] and stand on top
[4143.54 → 4144.16] of the mount
[4144.16 → 4144.94] and you can see
[4144.94 → 4145.50] from the Mount
[4145.50 → 4145.90] of Olives
[4145.90 → 4147.34] over the Temple
[4147.34 → 4147.68] Mount
[4147.68 → 4148.72] and to Jerusalem
[4148.72 → 4150.50] and we did this
[4150.50 → 4151.12] teaching
[4151.12 → 4151.92] this story
[4151.92 → 4153.52] standing on the top
[4153.52 → 4154.24] of Mount of Olives
[4154.24 → 4155.04] and then we marched
[4155.04 → 4156.16] down the road
[4156.16 → 4157.94] following the path
[4157.94 → 4158.70] that likely
[4158.70 → 4159.56] Jesus would have
[4159.56 → 4159.92] followed
[4159.92 → 4161.52] into the valley
[4161.52 → 4162.42] past the Garden
[4162.42 → 4163.14] of Gethsemane
[4163.14 → 4163.96] and then up
[4163.96 → 4165.74] into Jerusalem
[4165.74 → 4166.62] walking this
[4166.62 → 4168.12] very journey
[4168.12 → 4169.22] about halfway
[4169.22 → 4169.62] down
[4169.62 → 4171.18] we stopped
[4171.18 → 4172.32] under a tree
[4172.32 → 4173.78] and we read
[4173.78 → 4174.40] this story
[4174.40 → 4176.86] and I
[4176.86 → 4178.12] started
[4178.12 → 4179.62] bawling
[4179.62 → 4181.68] weeping
[4181.68 → 4183.34] for the moment
[4183.34 → 4184.78] of standing there
[4184.78 → 4185.50] looking out
[4185.50 → 4186.38] over the city
[4186.38 → 4187.48] and mapping
[4187.48 → 4188.28] over top
[4188.28 → 4189.14] of the Temple
[4189.14 → 4189.52] Mount
[4189.52 → 4190.44] these ancient
[4190.44 → 4191.02] people who
[4191.02 → 4192.10] Jesus cried for
[4192.10 → 4192.78] with the modern
[4192.78 → 4193.94] people who don't
[4193.94 → 4194.42] know him
[4194.42 → 4195.06] and with all the
[4195.06 → 4196.02] people in my life
[4196.02 → 4197.08] who don't know him
[4197.08 → 4197.62] all the people
[4197.62 → 4198.66] that I haven't yet
[4198.66 → 4199.36] met who don't
[4199.36 → 4199.74] know him
[4199.74 → 4200.40] and it just
[4200.40 → 4201.94] weighed on me
[4201.94 → 4202.70] and I wept
[4202.70 → 4203.96] I joined Jesus
[4203.96 → 4204.96] in weeping
[4204.96 → 4205.78] for those people
[4205.78 → 4206.34] who think
[4206.34 → 4207.22] they know him
[4207.22 → 4210.32] but are missing
[4210.32 → 4210.70] what's right
[4210.70 → 4211.28] in front of them
[4211.28 → 4215.56] how will they know
[4215.56 → 4217.74] how will I
[4217.74 → 4218.58] make him known
[4218.58 → 4222.20] moved by
[4222.20 → 4222.98] compassion
[4222.98 → 4223.72] for
[4223.72 → 4225.10] helping people
[4225.10 → 4225.66] to see
[4225.66 → 4226.16] or
[4226.16 → 4230.44] is there a
[4230.44 → 4230.78] sense of
[4230.78 → 4231.44] superiority
[4231.44 → 4233.12] in having it
[4233.12 → 4233.74] figured out
[4233.74 → 4234.90] knowing all
[4234.90 → 4235.56] the answers
[4235.56 → 4237.20] making sure
[4237.20 → 4237.66] other people
[4237.66 → 4238.16] know that I
[4238.16 → 4238.48] know all
[4238.48 → 4238.98] the answers
[4238.98 → 4240.92] what is it
[4240.92 → 4241.52] that moves
[4241.52 → 4242.08] us
[4242.08 → 4245.64] in our
[4245.64 → 4246.10] time and
[4246.10 → 4246.48] place
[4246.48 → 4246.98] in our
[4246.98 → 4247.42] culture
[4247.42 → 4249.16] there is a
[4249.16 → 4250.08] story that
[4250.08 → 4250.86] was told
[4250.86 → 4251.28] that was
[4251.28 → 4251.86] started being
[4251.86 → 4252.24] told
[4252.24 → 4253.60] hundreds of
[4253.60 → 4254.18] years ago
[4254.18 → 4255.00] and has
[4255.00 → 4255.86] continued to
[4255.86 → 4256.42] be told
[4256.42 → 4258.14] that God
[4258.14 → 4258.80] is not
[4258.80 → 4259.28] real
[4259.28 → 4259.96] that God
[4259.96 → 4260.66] is dead
[4260.66 → 4261.10] and we have
[4261.10 → 4261.62] killed him
[4261.62 → 4262.92] but they've
[4262.92 → 4263.66] been connecting
[4263.66 → 4264.42] it in what's
[4264.42 → 4265.04] now come to
[4265.04 → 4265.58] be known as
[4265.58 → 4266.18] the secular
[4266.18 → 4266.64] gospel
[4266.64 → 4267.20] the secular
[4267.20 → 4267.80] myth that
[4267.80 → 4268.06] says
[4268.06 → 4270.04] don't worry
[4270.04 → 4270.70] don't have
[4270.70 → 4271.22] anxiety
[4271.22 → 4272.00] don't carry
[4272.00 → 4272.60] guilt or
[4272.60 → 4272.92] shame
[4272.92 → 4273.64] because God's
[4273.64 → 4274.08] not real
[4274.08 → 4274.62] and so go
[4274.62 → 4275.08] just do what
[4275.08 → 4275.40] you want to
[4275.40 → 4275.60] do
[4275.60 → 4277.42] that's the
[4277.42 → 4278.06] message that
[4278.06 → 4278.72] has become so
[4278.72 → 4279.66] popular in
[4279.66 → 4280.22] Europe and
[4280.22 → 4280.76] in Canada
[4280.76 → 4281.56] and around
[4281.56 → 4281.98] the world
[4281.98 → 4283.92] God's not
[4283.92 → 4285.18] real so just
[4285.18 → 4285.60] go and have
[4285.60 → 4285.88] fun
[4285.88 → 4289.14] but that
[4289.14 → 4290.92] message in
[4290.92 → 4291.48] the last
[4291.48 → 4292.60] five to ten
[4292.60 → 4293.20] years
[4293.20 → 4294.32] especially
[4294.32 → 4294.34] especially
[4294.34 → 4294.92] among young
[4294.92 → 4295.34] people
[4295.34 → 4296.54] has proved
[4296.54 → 4296.90] to be
[4296.90 → 4297.28] empty
[4297.28 → 4298.50] and vapid
[4298.50 → 4299.64] it's proved
[4299.64 → 4300.10] to be
[4300.10 → 4300.70] anemic
[4300.70 → 4301.58] and devoid
[4301.58 → 4302.08] of any
[4302.08 → 4303.22] real meaning
[4303.22 → 4304.52] and it's
[4304.52 → 4305.40] leaving people
[4305.40 → 4305.98] in this
[4305.98 → 4306.52] time and
[4306.52 → 4307.02] place where
[4307.02 → 4308.18] anxiety is
[4308.18 → 4308.78] spiking
[4308.78 → 4312.12] and here
[4312.12 → 4312.68] we are
[4312.68 → 4313.90] a church
[4313.90 → 4314.46] of people
[4314.46 → 4315.56] who see
[4315.56 → 4316.14] Jesus
[4316.14 → 4317.02] Lord willing
[4317.02 → 4317.50] as he
[4317.50 → 4318.18] really is
[4318.18 → 4319.70] with a
[4319.70 → 4320.40] message for
[4320.40 → 4320.92] those who
[4320.92 → 4321.50] do not
[4321.50 → 4324.64] now
[4324.64 → 4325.38] I quoted
[4325.38 → 4326.08] some statistics
[4326.08 → 4326.56] earlier
[4326.56 → 4327.72] I want to
[4327.72 → 4328.18] return to
[4328.18 → 4329.12] that and
[4329.12 → 4329.52] tell the
[4329.52 → 4329.94] continued
[4329.94 → 4330.72] story because
[4330.72 → 4331.26] it's actually
[4331.26 → 4332.34] kind of
[4332.34 → 4332.82] encouraging
[4332.82 → 4334.86] right in
[4334.86 → 4335.28] this same
[4335.28 → 4335.88] study that
[4335.88 → 4336.74] Cards did
[4336.74 → 4337.68] they noticed
[4337.68 → 4339.02] that there's
[4339.02 → 4339.40] been an
[4339.40 → 4340.56] increase in
[4340.56 → 4341.46] men under
[4341.46 → 4342.02] the age of
[4342.02 → 4343.52] 35 attending
[4343.52 → 4344.42] religious services
[4344.42 → 4345.04] at least once
[4345.04 → 4345.40] a month
[4345.40 → 4348.18] right that
[4348.18 → 4349.72] up to
[4349.72 → 4351.14] 22%
[4351.14 → 4352.96] in April
[4352.96 → 4353.92] of 2022
[4353.92 → 4354.86] which is up
[4354.86 → 4356.04] from 14%
[4356.04 → 4357.42] six years
[4357.42 → 4357.96] before that
[4357.96 → 4359.86] now this
[4359.86 → 4360.66] trend they
[4360.66 → 4361.14] note in the
[4361.14 → 4361.64] study is
[4361.64 → 4362.86] representative of
[4362.86 → 4363.68] something that
[4363.68 → 4364.98] permeates the
[4364.98 → 4365.50] report
[4365.50 → 4366.48] right younger
[4366.48 → 4367.58] Canadians are
[4367.58 → 4368.56] more likely to
[4368.56 → 4369.14] be attending
[4369.14 → 4370.24] religious services
[4370.24 → 4371.10] at least once
[4371.10 → 4371.50] a month
[4371.50 → 4373.12] right 20%
[4373.12 → 4373.72] of younger
[4373.72 → 4374.18] Canadians
[4374.18 → 4374.86] compared to
[4374.86 → 4375.62] 13%
[4375.62 → 4376.32] of people
[4376.32 → 4377.10] over 35
[4377.10 → 4379.62] in fact
[4379.62 → 4380.92] it's younger
[4380.92 → 4381.44] Canadians
[4381.44 → 4382.32] under 35
[4382.32 → 4383.42] that is the
[4383.42 → 4383.90] only
[4383.90 → 4386.36] group to
[4386.36 → 4387.06] see an
[4387.06 → 4387.84] increase
[4387.84 → 4389.34] in commitment
[4389.34 → 4390.12] and religious
[4390.12 → 4390.64] involvement
[4390.64 → 4393.12] younger Canadians
[4393.12 → 4394.00] age 35
[4394.00 → 4395.00] and younger
[4395.00 → 4395.62] who identify
[4395.62 → 4396.36] as Christian
[4396.36 → 4397.18] are twice
[4397.18 → 4398.08] as likely
[4398.08 → 4399.38] to attend
[4399.38 → 4400.46] religious services
[4400.46 → 4401.06] more than
[4401.06 → 4401.66] any other
[4401.66 → 4401.98] group
[4401.98 → 4402.80] a whole
[4402.80 → 4403.36] one-third
[4403.36 → 4403.82] of that
[4403.82 → 4404.40] population
[4404.40 → 4405.52] is likely
[4405.52 → 4405.88] to do
[4405.88 → 4406.12] that
[4406.12 → 4407.18] you know
[4407.18 → 4407.38] what the
[4407.38 → 4408.00] second largest
[4408.00 → 4408.70] group is
[4408.70 → 4410.54] immigrants
[4410.54 → 4411.50] who identify
[4411.50 → 4412.06] as Canadian
[4412.06 → 4416.60] this week
[4416.60 → 4417.24] I was listening
[4417.24 → 4418.48] to an
[4418.48 → 4418.94] incredible
[4418.94 → 4420.84] discussion
[4420.84 → 4421.44] about a
[4421.44 → 4422.06] report that
[4422.06 → 4422.52] was just
[4422.52 → 4423.06] released
[4423.06 → 4424.12] in the
[4424.12 → 4424.54] UK
[4424.54 → 4426.42] tracking the
[4426.42 → 4426.62] same
[4426.62 → 4427.66] statistics
[4427.66 → 4429.04] from
[4429.04 → 4429.68] from 2018
[4429.68 → 4430.66] to 2024
[4430.66 → 4431.54] in Britain
[4431.54 → 4432.44] the Bible
[4432.44 → 4433.06] Society
[4433.06 → 4433.86] dug into
[4433.86 → 4434.28] these
[4434.28 → 4435.32] things
[4435.32 → 4435.60] and they
[4435.60 → 4436.02] published
[4436.02 → 4436.76] just published
[4436.76 → 4437.28] a report
[4437.28 → 4437.64] and that
[4437.64 → 4438.28] report is
[4438.28 → 4438.64] called
[4438.64 → 4439.32] the quiet
[4439.32 → 4440.06] revival
[4440.06 → 4440.12] revival
[4440.12 → 4441.90] and Glenn
[4441.90 → 4442.68] Scrivener
[4442.68 → 4443.24] has a
[4443.24 → 4443.70] discussion
[4443.70 → 4444.66] on the
[4444.66 → 4444.98] quiet
[4444.98 → 4445.60] revival
[4445.60 → 4446.48] where he
[4446.48 → 4446.86] notes
[4446.86 → 4447.24] that from
[4447.24 → 4447.74] 2018
[4447.74 → 4448.60] to 2024
[4448.60 → 4449.42] in the
[4449.42 → 4449.72] UK
[4449.72 → 4451.76] regular
[4451.76 → 4452.36] church
[4452.36 → 4452.88] attenders
[4452.88 → 4453.12] that's
[4453.12 → 4453.52] monthly
[4453.52 → 4453.88] church
[4453.88 → 4454.32] attenders
[4454.32 → 4454.72] has gone
[4454.72 → 4454.94] from
[4454.94 → 4455.72] 8%
[4455.72 → 4456.90] to 12%
[4456.90 → 4459.10] among
[4459.10 → 4459.96] 18 to
[4459.96 → 4460.76] 24 year
[4460.76 → 4461.02] olds
[4461.02 → 4461.30] though
[4461.30 → 4461.78] it's gone
[4461.78 → 4462.00] from
[4462.00 → 4462.86] 4%
[4462.86 → 4463.36] to
[4463.36 → 4464.60] 16%
[4464.60 → 4466.86] and it
[4466.86 → 4467.26] works out
[4467.26 → 4467.54] in the
[4467.54 → 4467.76] UK
[4467.76 → 4468.08] that a
[4468.08 → 4468.24] whole
[4468.24 → 4468.80] one-third
[4468.80 → 4469.28] of adult
[4469.28 → 4469.54] church
[4469.54 → 4469.90] goers
[4469.90 → 4470.44] are now
[4470.44 → 4471.02] 18 to
[4471.02 → 4471.52] 30 years
[4471.52 → 4471.80] old
[4471.80 → 4472.40] 18 to
[4472.40 → 4472.98] 34 years
[4472.98 → 4473.20] old
[4473.20 → 4474.18] that's up
[4474.18 → 4475.18] from 14%
[4475.18 → 4475.88] that's a
[4475.88 → 4476.54] parallel number
[4476.54 → 4477.04] to what is
[4477.04 → 4477.54] experienced
[4477.54 → 4477.90] here in
[4477.90 → 4478.18] Canada
[4478.18 → 4480.88] and again
[4480.88 → 4481.72] among
[4481.72 → 4482.90] the under
[4482.90 → 4483.48] 55
[4483.48 → 4484.10] church
[4484.10 → 4484.66] goers
[4484.66 → 4485.64] 32%
[4485.64 → 4486.14] of them
[4486.14 → 4486.62] in Britain
[4486.62 → 4487.52] are immigrants
[4487.52 → 4487.98] which is
[4487.98 → 4488.30] another
[4488.30 → 4488.70] parallel
[4488.70 → 4489.06] to what
[4489.06 → 4489.16] we're
[4489.16 → 4489.48] seeing
[4489.48 → 4490.24] here in
[4490.24 → 4490.60] Canada
[4490.60 → 4493.44] and when
[4493.44 → 4494.92] Glenn
[4494.92 → 4495.48] Scrivener
[4495.48 → 4495.98] digs into
[4495.98 → 4496.58] these numbers
[4496.58 → 4497.66] there's one
[4497.66 → 4498.06] thing that I
[4498.06 → 4498.30] want to
[4498.30 → 4499.40] share with
[4499.40 → 4500.02] you and
[4500.02 → 4500.54] note and I
[4500.54 → 4500.90] encourage you
[4500.90 → 4501.36] to go check
[4501.36 → 4501.62] out the
[4501.62 → 4502.04] video I
[4502.04 → 4502.58] can share
[4502.58 → 4502.84] with you
[4502.84 → 4503.16] the link
[4503.16 → 4503.58] afterwards
[4503.58 → 4503.88] you can
[4503.88 → 4504.66] watch it
[4504.66 → 4507.22] but in
[4507.22 → 4507.82] relation to
[4507.82 → 4508.46] our idea
[4508.46 → 4509.58] of people
[4509.58 → 4510.18] think they
[4510.18 → 4510.58] know
[4510.58 → 4513.54] but he
[4513.54 → 4514.02] talks about
[4514.02 → 4514.78] this shift
[4514.78 → 4515.66] that's taking
[4515.66 → 4516.48] place from
[4516.48 → 4517.46] nominalism
[4517.46 → 4519.36] to practicing
[4519.36 → 4520.18] to a deep
[4520.18 → 4521.00] rootedness
[4521.00 → 4521.70] from being
[4521.70 → 4522.36] Christian only
[4522.36 → 4522.92] in name
[4522.92 → 4523.68] to actually
[4523.68 → 4524.62] living it
[4524.62 → 4525.52] and sharing
[4525.52 → 4525.78] it
[4525.78 → 4526.36] and he
[4526.36 → 4526.76] says that
[4526.76 → 4527.00] if you
[4527.00 → 4527.86] identify as
[4527.86 → 4528.42] a Christian
[4528.42 → 4529.34] but you
[4529.34 → 4529.78] don't go
[4529.78 → 4530.28] to church
[4530.28 → 4530.88] what the
[4530.88 → 4531.38] statistics
[4531.38 → 4532.18] actually are
[4532.18 → 4532.72] bearing out
[4532.72 → 4533.12] is that you
[4533.12 → 4533.66] have higher
[4533.66 → 4534.38] anxiety
[4534.38 → 4535.38] and less
[4535.38 → 4535.86] hope for
[4535.86 → 4536.38] the world
[4536.38 → 4537.42] than even
[4537.42 → 4538.64] our non-Christian
[4538.64 → 4539.82] neighbours
[4539.82 → 4542.16] right you've
[4542.16 → 4542.60] got much
[4542.60 → 4544.58] less self-reporting
[4544.58 → 4545.16] about your
[4545.16 → 4546.10] own well-being
[4546.10 → 4547.56] right to
[4547.56 → 4549.02] simply name
[4549.02 → 4549.60] the name
[4549.60 → 4550.50] of Christianity
[4550.50 → 4551.90] without engaging
[4551.90 → 4552.62] in the church
[4552.62 → 4553.60] actually seems
[4553.60 → 4554.20] to be bad
[4554.20 → 4554.66] for you
[4554.66 → 4556.72] I'll give
[4556.72 → 4557.00] you he
[4557.00 → 4557.40] says
[4557.40 → 4558.76] directly
[4558.76 → 4559.04] he says
[4559.04 → 4559.66] going to
[4559.66 → 4559.98] church
[4559.98 → 4560.76] is incredibly
[4560.76 → 4561.28] good for
[4561.28 → 4561.50] you
[4561.50 → 4562.14] but what
[4562.14 → 4562.88] is absolutely
[4562.88 → 4563.66] worse for
[4563.66 → 4564.10] you are
[4564.10 → 4564.74] claiming to
[4564.74 → 4565.36] be Christian
[4565.36 → 4565.96] and not
[4565.96 → 4566.58] showing up
[4566.58 → 4567.82] not engaging
[4567.82 → 4568.14] in the
[4568.14 → 4568.60] practices
[4568.60 → 4571.06] and so as
[4571.06 → 4571.54] we sit here
[4571.54 → 4572.14] and we wonder
[4572.14 → 4573.44] about ourselves
[4573.44 → 4574.36] and as we
[4574.36 → 4574.90] look at our
[4574.90 → 4575.66] own lives
[4575.66 → 4576.94] as we ask
[4576.94 → 4577.60] the question
[4577.60 → 4578.92] about those
[4578.92 → 4580.24] who think
[4580.24 → 4580.84] they know
[4580.84 → 4583.16] but maybe
[4583.16 → 4584.18] are missing
[4584.18 → 4585.34] something
[4585.34 → 4587.24] as we wonder
[4587.24 → 4588.20] about how it
[4588.20 → 4588.86] is that the
[4588.86 → 4589.88] stones will
[4589.88 → 4590.74] cry out
[4590.74 → 4591.80] but the people
[4591.80 → 4592.80] don't recognize
[4592.80 → 4593.34] him
[4593.34 → 4594.84] as we ensure
[4594.84 → 4595.50] that we're not
[4595.50 → 4596.48] making the same
[4596.48 → 4597.76] mistake
[4597.76 → 4599.76] I invite you
[4599.76 → 4601.02] to reflect
[4601.02 → 4602.74] and to wonder
[4602.74 → 4604.72] discussing
[4604.72 → 4605.68] this trend
[4605.68 → 4606.54] in the UK
[4606.54 → 4607.86] Gavin Portland
[4607.86 → 4609.20] says
[4609.20 → 4610.32] wouldn't it
[4610.32 → 4611.02] be just
[4611.02 → 4611.92] like God
[4611.92 → 4612.50] to bring
[4612.50 → 4613.10] about a
[4613.10 → 4614.32] quiet revival
[4614.32 → 4615.34] in an age
[4615.34 → 4615.92] filled with
[4615.92 → 4616.52] blustering
[4616.52 → 4617.94] and grandstanding
[4617.94 → 4619.10] and polarities
[4619.10 → 4620.14] and arguing
[4620.14 → 4620.98] for God
[4620.98 → 4621.48] just to do
[4621.48 → 4622.08] his thing
[4622.08 → 4623.08] quietly
[4623.08 → 4626.26] earlier we
[4626.26 → 4626.84] sang a song
[4626.84 → 4627.38] I see a
[4627.38 → 4627.90] generation
[4627.90 → 4628.86] rising up
[4628.86 → 4629.32] to take
[4629.32 → 4630.00] their place
[4630.00 → 4632.70] I think
[4632.70 → 4633.24] God's doing
[4633.24 → 4633.72] something
[4633.72 → 4635.14] in our
[4635.14 → 4635.52] midst
[4635.52 → 4636.54] I think
[4636.54 → 4637.04] God's doing
[4637.04 → 4637.42] something
[4637.42 → 4638.02] in our
[4638.02 → 4638.56] time
[4638.56 → 4639.22] and it's
[4639.22 → 4639.78] our privilege
[4639.78 → 4640.10] and our
[4640.10 → 4640.48] joy
[4640.48 → 4641.66] to partner
[4641.66 → 4642.16] with him
[4642.16 → 4642.82] to cooperate
[4642.82 → 4643.52] with the
[4643.52 → 4644.10] Holy Spirit
[4644.10 → 4644.80] in what
[4644.80 → 4645.34] God is
[4645.34 → 4645.66] doing
[4645.66 → 4646.36] and maybe
[4646.36 → 4647.54] this quiet
[4647.54 → 4648.06] revival
[4648.06 → 4648.58] gets just
[4648.58 → 4649.06] a little bit
[4649.06 → 4649.76] louder for a
[4649.76 → 4650.02] day
[4650.02 → 4650.76] on Palm
[4650.76 → 4651.10] Sunday
[4651.10 → 4652.82] maybe
[4652.82 → 4654.08] we see
[4654.08 → 4654.48] Jesus
[4654.48 → 4655.18] for whom
[4655.18 → 4656.26] he really
[4656.26 → 4657.40] is
[4657.40 → 4659.12] and may
[4659.12 → 4659.54] I say
[4659.54 → 4660.04] that's also
[4660.04 → 4660.34] why we
[4660.34 → 4660.60] come to
[4660.60 → 4660.78] this
[4660.78 → 4661.08] table
[4661.08 → 4662.54] so that
[4662.54 → 4662.76] we can
[4662.76 → 4662.96] see
[4662.96 → 4663.30] Jesus
[4663.30 → 4663.82] for whom
[4663.82 → 4664.10] he
[4664.10 → 4664.88] really
[4664.88 → 4665.58] is
[4665.58 → 4665.84] so that
[4665.84 → 4666.10] we can
[4666.10 → 4666.60] meet him
[4666.60 → 4667.04] here
[4667.04 → 4667.64] in the
[4667.64 → 4667.92] word
[4667.92 → 4668.22] and in
[4668.22 → 4668.36] our
[4668.36 → 4668.68] worship
[4668.68 → 4669.08] and then
[4669.08 → 4669.34] we can
[4669.34 → 4669.82] take him
[4669.82 → 4670.24] in
[4670.24 → 4670.88] in the
[4670.88 → 4671.20] bread
[4671.20 → 4672.32] and the
[4672.32 → 4672.68] juice
[4672.68 → 4674.70] God
[4674.70 → 4675.40] is up
[4675.40 → 4675.66] to
[4675.66 → 4676.32] something
[4676.32 → 4677.50] amen
[4677.50 → 4679.40] let's
[4679.40 → 4679.80] join him
[4679.80 → 4680.12] in that
[4680.12 → 4680.38] work
[4680.38 → 4680.84] let's
[4680.84 → 4680.98] pray
[4680.98 → 4681.34] together
[4681.34 → 4687.34] God
[4687.34 → 4687.60] you
[4687.60 → 4688.08] are
[4688.08 → 4688.82] so
[4688.82 → 4689.84] good
[4689.84 → 4691.30] it's
[4691.30 → 4691.74] magnificent
[4691.74 → 4692.66] to see
[4692.66 → 4692.98] you
[4692.98 → 4693.56] at work
[4693.56 → 4693.90] in our
[4693.90 → 4694.22] midst
[4694.22 → 4694.50] and in
[4694.50 → 4694.60] the
[4694.60 → 4694.90] world
[4694.90 → 4696.00] we
[4696.00 → 4696.46] thank you
[4696.46 → 4696.74] for the
[4696.74 → 4697.10] privilege
[4697.10 → 4697.48] now
[4697.48 → 4698.06] of coming
[4698.06 → 4698.48] to
[4698.48 → 4699.34] this
[4699.34 → 4699.96] table
[4699.96 → 4700.98] for the
[4700.98 → 4701.56] truth
[4701.56 → 4701.86] that you

[5792.40 → 5797.40] My name is written on his heart
[5797.40 → 5803.40] I know that while in heaven he stands
[5803.40 → 5809.40] No tongue can bid me thence depart

[5813.40 → 5817.40] No tongue can bid me thence depart
[5817.40 → 5827.40] When Satan tempts me to despair
[5827.40 → 5832.40] And tells me of the guilt within
[5832.40 → 5837.40] But would I look and see him there
[5837.40 → 5843.40] Who made an end of all my sin
[5843.40 → 5848.40] Because the sinless Saviour died
[5848.40 → 5852.40] My sinful soul is counted free
[5852.40 → 5858.40] For God the justice satisfied
[5858.40 → 5863.40] To look on him and pardon me
[5863.40 → 5869.40] To look on him and pardon me
[5869.40 → 5881.40] Be bold in there the risen Lamb
[5881.40 → 5886.40] My perfect spotless righteousness
[5886.40 → 5891.40] The great unchangeable I am

[5897.40 → 5902.40] One with himself I cannot die

[5965.40 → 5967.40] Of our continuing to worship
[5967.40 → 5972.40] So as we go this week we go with God
[5972.40 → 5975.40] And not only with him, but he goes before us
[5975.40 → 5978.40] Preparing a way for us to go
[5978.40 → 5981.40] And so we walk with him
[5982.40 → 5984.40] Before we receive God's blessing
[5984.40 → 5987.40] Just one quick reminder and invitation
[5987.40 → 5991.40] We have the Mexico mission recap lunch here
[5991.40 → 5993.40] We're going to aim to start that at noon
[5993.40 → 5996.40] And, so please hang out enjoy your fellowship
[5996.40 → 6000.40] Have coffee and together and stick around
[6000.40 → 6002.40] And we'll transform this space
[6002.40 → 6004.40] If you are able to help to transform the space
[6004.40 → 6008.40] Closer to noon that would be helpful and wonderful
[6008.40 → 6012.40] And then we'll hear from them and their time there
[6012.40 → 6016.40] As you go then receive the blessing of our God
[6016.40 → 6022.40] May God go before you to lead you
[6022.40 → 6025.40] May God go behind you to protect you
[6026.40 → 6029.40] May God go beneath you to support you
[6029.40 → 6032.40] And may God go beside you to befriend you
[6032.40 → 6034.40] Do not be afraid
[6034.40 → 6037.40] Let the blessing of God come upon you today
[6037.40 → 6040.40] Do not be afraid but go in peace
[6040.40 → 6044.40] To love and serve our King
