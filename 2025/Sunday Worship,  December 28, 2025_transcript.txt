[0.00 --> 19.10]  How great the chasm that lay between us
[19.10 --> 24.94]  How high the mountain I could not climb
[24.94 --> 31.96]  In desperation I turned to heaven
[31.96 --> 38.22]  And spoke your name into the night
[38.22 --> 45.58]  Then through the darkness your loving kindness
[45.58 --> 51.36]  Tore through the shadows of my soul
[51.36 --> 58.48]  The work is finished The end is written
[58.48 --> 64.92]  Jesus Christ my living hope
[64.92 --> 75.18]  Who could imagine So great a mercy
[75.18 --> 82.30]  What heart could fathom Such boundless grace
[82.30 --> 88.30]  The God of ages Stepped down from glory
[88.30 --> 95.42]  To wear my sin And bear my shame
[95.42 --> 102.54]  The cross has spoken I am forgiven
[102.54 --> 109.66]  The King of kings Called me his own
[109.66 --> 116.78]  Beautiful Savior I'm yours forever
[116.78 --> 122.78]  Jesus Christ my living hope
[122.78 --> 125.90]  Hallelujah
[125.90 --> 129.90]  Praise the one who set me free
[129.90 --> 133.02]  Hallelujah
[133.02 --> 136.34]  Death has lost its grip on me
[136.34 --> 139.74]  You have broken every chain
[139.74 --> 143.02]  This self is shed in your name
[143.02 --> 150.14]  Jesus Christ my living hope
[150.14 --> 152.14]  Jesus Christ my living hope
[152.14 --> 154.14]  Hallelujah
[154.14 --> 161.26]  Then came the morning That sealed the price
[161.26 --> 163.26]  And the Lord of kings
[163.26 --> 164.18]  And the Lord of kings
[164.18 --> 165.26]  I am the one who set me free
[165.26 --> 166.26]  Hallelujah
[166.26 --> 169.26]  Death has lost its grip on me

[173.26 --> 177.26]  Jesus Christ my living hope
[177.26 --> 178.38]  Jesus Christ my living hope
[178.38 --> 184.38]  Then came the morning That sealed the promise
[184.38 --> 190.38]  Your buried body Began to breathe
[190.38 --> 196.38]  Out of the silence The roaring lion
[196.38 --> 202.38]  Declared the grave Has no claim on me
[202.38 --> 203.50]  Has no claim on me
[203.50 --> 205.50]  Has no claim on me
[205.50 --> 209.50]  Then came the morning That sealed the promise
[209.50 --> 211.50]  Your buried body Began to breathe
[211.50 --> 215.50]  Out of the silence The roaring lion
[215.50 --> 219.50]  Declared the grave Has no claim on me
[219.50 --> 221.50]  Out of the silence The roaring lion
[221.50 --> 225.50]  Declared the grave Has no claim on me
[225.50 --> 227.50]  Has no claim on me

[254.62 --> 258.62]  You have broken every chain
[258.62 --> 262.86]  This now we say in your name
[262.86 --> 267.74]  Jesus Christ my living hope
[267.74 --> 271.74]  Hallelujah
[278.70 --> 279.42]  Good morning
[281.18 --> 282.86]  Welcome to church
[282.86 --> 286.30]  A special welcome if you are a guest with us this morning
[286.30 --> 293.82]  My name is Chris one of the pastors here and it's my privilege to lead us in our shared worship together this morning
[294.14 --> 298.46]  Before we begin I just have a few announcements two of them actually
[299.58 --> 303.42]  First on January 1st New Year's Day
[304.06 --> 310.22]  We have the opportunity to gather as a church family and do some skating together
[310.22 --> 315.42]  And so January 1st at 1230 at Canland Arena
[316.06 --> 320.38]  Sometimes called Twin Rinks Arena just a little ways over there
[321.10 --> 323.10]  We have the ice sheet for an hour
[323.74 --> 329.74]  We can skate following that we've got the upstairs room where there'll be some hot chocolates and refreshments and the like
[329.74 --> 338.30]  I was talking earlier with someone and I said I was going to encourage people to bring any leftover baking that you might have
[338.94 --> 340.94]  And then someone looked at me and said leftover
[342.30 --> 343.90]  So if you have any extra baking
[344.62 --> 348.14]  Please go ahead and bring that with you on January 1st
[348.14 --> 350.14]  As we gather for skating
[350.86 --> 353.50]  The second announcement is more of
[354.62 --> 357.18]  An invitation to consider
[358.54 --> 364.54]  This past week the president of the Trinity Western University Student Association
[365.10 --> 368.14]  emailed me and said we want to
[368.78 --> 370.78]  Start running a shuttle from
[371.42 --> 372.86]  Trinity to your church
[373.58 --> 375.26]  every week
[375.26 --> 380.38]  But you need to provide the shuttle and you need to staff it and you need to schedule it
[383.50 --> 387.34]  To which I said that sounds like a great problem for you guys
[388.22 --> 393.82]  To figure out how to solve and so he has invited us to consider this opportunity
[394.46 --> 398.62]  We're going to try to run it for an as an experiment for a month or so
[399.26 --> 401.98]  Lord willing beginning on January 25
[401.98 --> 407.10]  And so the end of january we would love to see this and so i'm putting this to you
[407.98 --> 409.02]  wondering
[409.02 --> 414.94]  How might the lord move us to solve this problem or to meet this request and so
[415.50 --> 416.70]  If you have some ideas
[417.90 --> 421.66]  We would probably need to start with at least a 15 person vehicle
[424.06 --> 427.82]  And so if you have some ideas on how to solve that or address that please talk to me
[427.82 --> 433.02]  Uh, either today or any time in the next week or so we'd love to get that moving
[434.54 --> 435.82]  That's all I have for announcements
[437.82 --> 439.26]  Sunridge gardens
[439.26 --> 440.94]  Thanks ken it's good thing you're here

[448.62 --> 454.38]  Uh at 2 p.m. We have a group that leads worship at sunridge seniors living facility up the hill

[461.74 --> 466.30]  Perfect let's stand together we can be welcomed by god in his presence
[466.30 --> 475.50]  After I speak god's greeting to us this morning
[475.50 --> 479.34]  I invite you to turn to those around you and to extend that greeting
[480.06 --> 481.50]  By welcoming those
[481.50 --> 487.90]  Beside you and behind you in front of you in worship by passing the peace of christ or by saying the lord be with you
[488.46 --> 492.14]  Welcoming them together receive the greeting of our good god

[568.62 --> 573.66]  In all their distress. He too was distressed and the angel of his presence saved them
[574.30 --> 580.46]  In his love and mercy he redeemed them. He lifted them up and carried them all the days of old
[580.46 --> 582.78]  and led them all the days of the lord

[1676.72 --> 1678.72]  Christ the Lord upon the tree.
[1678.72 --> 1681.72]  But no grave could e'er restrain Him.
[1681.72 --> 1686.72]  Praise the Lord, He is alive.
[1686.72 --> 1691.72]  What a foretaste of deliverance.
[1691.72 --> 1696.72]  How unwavering our hope.
[1696.72 --> 1700.72]  Christ in power resurrected.
[1700.72 --> 1702.72]  As we will be when He comes.
[1702.72 --> 1704.72]  As we will be when He comes.
[1704.72 --> 1707.72]  What a foretaste of deliverance.
[1707.72 --> 1709.72]  How unwavering our hope.
[1709.72 --> 1710.72]  Christ in power resurrected.
[1710.72 --> 1715.72]  As we will be when He comes.
[1715.72 --> 1720.72]  Christ in power resurrected.
[1720.72 --> 1725.72]  As we will be when He comes.
[1725.72 --> 1726.72]  Christ in power resurrected.
[1726.72 --> 1727.72]  We will be when He comes.
[1727.72 --> 1728.72]  Christ in power resurrected.
[1728.72 --> 1729.72]  We will be when He comes.
[1729.72 --> 1730.72]  We will be when He comes.
[1730.72 --> 1731.72]  You know how unwavering our hopegeldium
[1731.72 --> 1732.72]  whose testament to us.
[1732.72 --> 1733.72]  As we will be when He up and our life Countries.
[1733.72 --> 1736.72]  YourDidius here is a miraclesabe kind.
[1736.72 --> 1739.72]  The biblical chaos and destiny are built.
[1739.72 --> 1756.80]  Good morning.
[1756.80 --> 1760.78]  My name is Brenda and I'm one of the deacons here at Emanuel.
[1760.78 --> 1764.96]  This is the last Sunday of 2025.
[1764.96 --> 1768.50]  How did we get here?
[1768.50 --> 1775.18]  Our offerings this morning are for the budget.
[1775.18 --> 1781.82]  This is the last opportunity, or up until the 31st, I guess, to give to the budget of our
[1781.82 --> 1783.94]  church here.
[1783.94 --> 1786.70]  And there's various ways that you can give as well.
[1786.70 --> 1791.70]  Please make sure that anything that goes into the bags today is designated.
[1791.70 --> 1795.98]  If you want it to go for budget, you label it as such.
[1795.98 --> 1798.94]  And I know it says Benevolence up there.
[1798.94 --> 1800.66]  Our special offering today is not for Benevolence.
[1800.66 --> 1806.72]  It actually is for NAME, North American Indigenous Ministries.
[1806.72 --> 1812.58]  NAME is committed to the growth and maturity of the First Nations Church, resulting in vibrant
[1812.58 --> 1815.54]  ministry to its community and beyond.
[1815.54 --> 1821.72]  A desire to see strong, healthy First Nations Native American believers connected to strong,
[1821.72 --> 1824.22]  healthy local churches.
[1824.22 --> 1828.22]  In some areas, the local church will have a distinct First Nations identity.
[1828.22 --> 1832.22]  In other locations, the identity may be more multicultural.
[1832.22 --> 1837.22]  Equipping and supporting First Nations people to engage in ministry near and far is very important
[1837.22 --> 1839.40]  to NAME.
[1839.40 --> 1847.30]  Through NAME, Tim and Charity Johnson and their family, Katie, Jessie, Mayan, Bo, work with the
[1847.30 --> 1852.66]  Shushwap First Nations to develop relationships with youth and young families there.
[1852.66 --> 1856.22]  Our church has supported them for many years.
[1856.22 --> 1861.70]  And they are working towards a grounded and strong identity and understanding of who the creator
[1861.70 --> 1865.62]  is and the love that he has for all people.
[1865.62 --> 1871.02]  And we would like to bless them with an offering today as well to help them in the ministry that
[1871.02 --> 1873.16]  they do in the Shushwap.
[1873.16 --> 1875.16]  Let's give as God has given to us.
[1891.70 --> 1906.02]  For this is the day you've given your servant.
[1906.02 --> 1918.02]  I will rejoice and be glad for the strength I have to live and breathe.
[1918.02 --> 1923.34]  For each skill your grace has given me.
[1923.34 --> 1934.34]  For the needs and opportunities that will glorify your great name.
[1934.34 --> 1944.66]  For each skill your grace has given me.
[1944.66 --> 1955.66]  Before you I kneel and ask for your goodness To cover the work of my hands
[1955.66 --> 1964.32]  For patience and peace to shape all my labor Your grace for me
[1964.32 --> 1972.64]  For your thoughts and my path Flow with me like a living stream
[1972.64 --> 1983.64]  Wear away the stones of pride and green Till your dweys are dwelling deep in me
[1983.64 --> 1988.64]  And a harvest of life is grown
[1988.64 --> 2013.62]  Before you we kneel our Master and Maker Establish the work of our hands And order our steps to be
[2013.62 --> 2020.62]  To seek first your kingdom In every small and great task May we live the gospel of your grace Serve your purpose in our fleeting days Then our lives will bring eternal praise And glory to your great name
[2020.62 --> 2039.54]  Have Your great name And all glory to your great name
[2039.54 --> 2044.36]  And all glory to your great name.
[2045.14 --> 2050.66]  And all glory to your great name.
[2050.66 --> 2080.64]  And all glory to your great name.
[2081.40 --> 2083.36]  I haven't seen you guys in a while.
[2083.48 --> 2085.80]  So can I still say Merry Christmas to you guys?
[2085.84 --> 2086.70]  Is that still possible?
[2087.20 --> 2088.76]  Even though it's a couple days late?
[2089.54 --> 2091.74]  Can you guys say it back to me and everybody else here?
[2091.80 --> 2092.44]  Nice and loud?
[2094.94 --> 2095.46]  Right on.
[2095.52 --> 2097.92]  Well today I wore my special sweater for you guys.
[2098.00 --> 2098.40]  You see this?
[2098.44 --> 2099.72]  I wear it every Christmas.
[2100.00 --> 2100.66]  Is it kind of cool?
[2102.64 --> 2103.92]  You not sure it's a nice sweater?
[2105.66 --> 2107.60]  Well your dad says I don't have a nice sweater.
[2107.68 --> 2109.38]  Well I'm going to have to talk to your dad after this.
[2109.38 --> 2111.44]  The one thing about this sweater though.
[2111.50 --> 2112.76]  Every year I put it on.
[2113.02 --> 2114.42]  It gets tighter and tighter.
[2114.54 --> 2117.18]  It's probably getting shrinking in the wash right?
[2117.32 --> 2118.30]  Is that probably what's happening?
[2118.82 --> 2119.12]  Okay.
[2119.12 --> 2121.26]  I'm getting bigger.
[2121.38 --> 2121.82]  Thanks buddy.
[2123.60 --> 2126.78]  I got a couple questions about Christmas I'd like to ask you guys though.
[2127.32 --> 2129.28]  We're going to talk a lot more in the back about it.
[2129.32 --> 2130.30]  But I got some questions.
[2130.40 --> 2134.72]  How many of you guys got to spend some time over Christmas with some cousins you haven't
[2134.72 --> 2135.52]  seen in a while?
[2135.52 --> 2136.70]  Oh right on.
[2136.88 --> 2137.14]  Good.
[2137.74 --> 2139.22]  How about grandparents?
[2139.52 --> 2141.08]  Did everybody get to see some grandparents?
[2142.02 --> 2142.42]  Yeah?
[2143.00 --> 2143.62]  That's good.
[2144.30 --> 2147.62]  How about did anybody do anything fun and exciting?
[2147.78 --> 2150.02]  Like did anybody go up to where there's like snow?
[2150.16 --> 2152.28]  Did anybody get a chance to go anywhere near snow?
[2153.08 --> 2153.82]  A little bit.
[2154.64 --> 2155.18]  Right on.
[2155.36 --> 2159.06]  How about is everybody happy about not being in school right now?
[2159.46 --> 2159.76]  Yeah.
[2160.50 --> 2162.10]  Is that one of the best parts about it?
[2162.10 --> 2168.10]  Well now that Christmas is over we got to kind of get back to the regular life.
[2168.38 --> 2170.46]  Parents maybe are going back to work tomorrow maybe.
[2171.66 --> 2174.32]  And we got to maybe we're going to start thinking we'll get back to school.
[2174.44 --> 2177.86]  So that's what we're going to talk about in children's worship time is the time after
[2177.86 --> 2179.54]  the shepherds saw baby Jesus.
[2179.66 --> 2183.94]  We're going to talk a bit about that and what we do after Jesus is born.
[2184.38 --> 2184.90]  Sound good?
[2185.82 --> 2188.34]  Let's get everybody to stand up and we're going to do the blessing.
[2192.10 --> 2195.00]  Let the Lord be with you.
[2195.18 --> 2196.80]  And also with you.
[2222.10 --> 2223.80]  Let the Lord be with you.
[2223.80 --> 2224.10]  Let the Lord be with you.
[2224.10 --> 2225.10]  Let the Lord be with you.
[2225.10 --> 2226.10]  Let the Lord be with you.
[2226.10 --> 2228.02]  My name is Clary.
[2228.22 --> 2237.04]  I'm an elder here and it is my privilege to lead us in our family congregational prayer
[2237.04 --> 2237.54]  this morning.
[2238.38 --> 2245.16]  Before doing that just two announcements from council.
[2245.16 --> 2256.68]  Just a note of gratitude to the congregation for all the support prayer and finances for
[2256.68 --> 2259.72]  the work and the ministry of this church over the last year.
[2259.72 --> 2276.92]  As of this week we're around 7% behind in our budget and we ask you prayerfully consider that
[2276.92 --> 2277.18]  number.
[2278.24 --> 2281.70]  And also Linda Rook with her husband Neil.
[2282.00 --> 2284.56]  Want to thank everyone for your prayers and support.
[2284.56 --> 2293.84]  Linda has a CT scan this morning to find out the scope of her bone cancer and we pray obviously
[2293.84 --> 2298.86]  for good results and for a good plan going forward.
[2299.86 --> 2305.36]  And we will pray that the Lord bring healing, strength and patience.
[2308.02 --> 2310.50]  So please join me as we pray.
[2310.50 --> 2310.56]  Amen.
[2314.56 --> 2325.50]  Our gracious Father in heaven and here among us we want to say thank you to you for this
[2325.50 --> 2326.26]  new day.
[2326.58 --> 2336.56]  This first day of the week where yet again as you yourself have done and continue to do
[2336.56 --> 2349.34]  we are able to rest and put away our concerns and our work and begin a new week stepping out
[2349.34 --> 2356.44]  in faith and not scurrying and hurrying and stockpiling for the future.
[2356.44 --> 2357.44]  And we are going to pray with you for this world.
[2357.44 --> 2357.74]  And we are going to show you for this moment.
[2357.74 --> 2358.44]  We are going to ask you for this moment.
[2358.44 --> 2359.44]  Thank you.
[2359.44 --> 2360.44]  I want to ask you for this moment.
[2360.44 --> 2361.44]  And I'm to ask you for this moment.
[2361.44 --> 2370.24]  You invite us to gather together to praise you and cast aside the urgency and often legitimate
[2370.24 --> 2373.06]  urgency of the demands of life.
[2374.00 --> 2384.26]  And in a sense we can reset our compass, reset our hearts and be reminded of your lavish love
[2384.26 --> 2386.62]  and your great gift of yourself.
[2387.16 --> 2393.08]  And particularly in this season of remembering your incarnation,
[2393.94 --> 2400.94]  Father, we want to say thank you to you for living among us
[2400.94 --> 2413.98]  and for becoming a visible friend and companion and savior
[2413.98 --> 2420.38]  not an abstraction but real, flesh and blood.
[2421.54 --> 2426.98]  This is a gift beyond our wildest dreams
[2426.98 --> 2433.76]  and even for those of us who have loved you as long as we have memory,
[2434.36 --> 2435.82]  this is a great mystery.
[2437.20 --> 2441.26]  But just because we don't understand it doesn't mean it's any less important.
[2441.26 --> 2445.78]  So thank you, Father, for making your dwelling among us.
[2446.58 --> 2456.64]  And we ask that today and through this week we may have glimpses of just how amazing this is
[2456.64 --> 2464.44]  and that our hearts may rejoice at your friendship and your love.
[2464.44 --> 2473.74]  This morning, Lord, we have a number of praises and petitions and concerns
[2473.74 --> 2476.24]  that we want to lift up to you.
[2476.64 --> 2481.88]  Again, not because we're worried you forgot that is not the case
[2481.88 --> 2490.72]  but so that we may collectively remember and beseech you and praise you
[2490.72 --> 2495.00]  for we are creatures who so quickly forget.
[2495.96 --> 2502.70]  So, Father, we ask that starting this morning already
[2502.70 --> 2506.38]  that you can use this church family that you have knit together
[2506.38 --> 2510.98]  to reflect your grace here in our communities.
[2512.40 --> 2517.50]  In the advent of cell phones
[2517.50 --> 2521.66]  and the planet being stitched together and connected,
[2522.38 --> 2529.34]  it's easy to have a focus that is everywhere else
[2529.34 --> 2532.38]  but at our own dinner tables and in our own communities.
[2532.38 --> 2537.82]  So, help us remember, Lord, that you have placed us in this time
[2537.82 --> 2543.96]  and in this place to be an agent of your grace and reconciliation
[2543.96 --> 2548.44]  here among us and where we live.
[2550.38 --> 2555.50]  We lift up the praises of Wes and Lena Chepkema
[2555.50 --> 2560.54]  as they adjust to their new reality for the food, for the cards,
[2561.18 --> 2564.52]  for the visits, and for the prayers they have received.
[2565.14 --> 2565.80]  Thank you, Lord.
[2566.98 --> 2568.96]  Continue to bless them.
[2571.88 --> 2575.08]  We also ask, Lord, that you continue to fortify
[2575.08 --> 2577.02]  Neil and Linda Rook
[2577.02 --> 2580.62]  in the light of her recent diagnosis of bone cancer
[2580.62 --> 2583.94]  and we give you praise that this morning
[2583.94 --> 2588.02]  they are finding more answers.
[2589.22 --> 2592.18]  Strengthen and encourage them
[2592.18 --> 2594.96]  and may your grace abound.
[2596.56 --> 2598.02]  In the same light, Lord,
[2598.22 --> 2602.36]  we grant peace, patience, and perseverance
[2602.36 --> 2604.86]  to John and Greta Kuypers
[2604.86 --> 2607.16]  as they await surgery for John.
[2607.16 --> 2611.42]  Please, Lord, enable John to begin healing
[2611.42 --> 2615.36]  and to begin a journey of restoration.
[2617.12 --> 2619.16]  We want to remember, Lord, too,
[2619.26 --> 2621.80]  that Lane Benny has stomach cancer.
[2622.22 --> 2624.82]  Please surround him with strength,
[2625.20 --> 2627.96]  with comfort, and with healing.
[2628.82 --> 2630.88]  And Father, to Leo and Debbie,
[2631.20 --> 2634.96]  please provide a great grace of peace,
[2634.96 --> 2637.50]  guidance, and courage
[2637.50 --> 2639.18]  as they support Lane
[2639.18 --> 2640.52]  through his treatments.
[2642.58 --> 2643.66]  And finally, Lord,
[2643.82 --> 2648.06]  we know that this Christmas season,
[2648.86 --> 2652.12]  while it is a delight and a joy
[2652.12 --> 2653.66]  and we behold you in wonder,
[2654.30 --> 2656.22]  we also know that in a lot of families
[2656.22 --> 2658.68]  it brings up,
[2659.84 --> 2661.20]  it can be a hard season.
[2661.20 --> 2664.62]  So, on the one hand,
[2664.74 --> 2668.60]  thank you that we can celebrate this season
[2668.60 --> 2672.82]  and for those families that have difficulty,
[2673.28 --> 2675.64]  thank you for your grace
[2675.64 --> 2678.66]  that has carried them through this year.
[2679.04 --> 2681.94]  And we ask that where there are broken relationships,
[2682.52 --> 2685.20]  that there may be seeds of healing
[2685.20 --> 2691.78]  and conversations and words of love.
[2693.62 --> 2694.06]  Finally,
[2695.06 --> 2697.72]  we know that gathered here among us,
[2698.42 --> 2700.96]  there are a lot of unspoken needs and concerns,
[2701.74 --> 2704.18]  and we want to lift those up to you, Lord.
[2704.74 --> 2706.76]  And particularly for those of us
[2706.76 --> 2709.00]  who would be struggling with sin,
[2709.00 --> 2713.06]  where we have a hard time turning to you
[2713.06 --> 2714.40]  because we're scared
[2714.40 --> 2719.42]  or downcast and discouraged,
[2720.28 --> 2722.74]  do not let our hearts grow cold.
[2723.48 --> 2726.38]  Continue to work in us
[2726.38 --> 2729.78]  and enable us to have the confidence
[2729.78 --> 2732.10]  in your promises
[2732.10 --> 2733.84]  and in your forgiveness.
[2735.36 --> 2735.68]  Amen.
[2739.00 --> 2768.16]  If you have a Bible
[2768.16 --> 2769.58]  or a device,
[2769.68 --> 2770.88]  I want to invite you to turn
[2770.88 --> 2772.86]  to Luke 2.
[2775.24 --> 2777.54]  Our text this morning is just one verse,
[2777.70 --> 2779.64]  but we'll get to that in a second.
[2782.00 --> 2783.20]  This Sunday,
[2783.62 --> 2785.96]  the Sunday after Christmas,
[2786.96 --> 2788.20]  kind of finds us
[2788.20 --> 2791.20]  in this in-between place.
[2792.12 --> 2794.62]  This sort of moment in the middle, right?
[2795.12 --> 2797.38]  Christmas isn't yet finished,
[2797.38 --> 2801.22]  and I know some of you still have family plans
[2801.22 --> 2803.00]  and things going on even today,
[2803.20 --> 2805.86]  but the high point has passed.
[2806.90 --> 2808.48]  The lights are still glowing,
[2808.80 --> 2810.78]  maybe your decorations are still up,
[2810.86 --> 2811.90]  but you've started thinking,
[2812.06 --> 2813.86]  when is it time to take them down?
[2816.84 --> 2817.76]  And yet,
[2818.34 --> 2821.74]  I know that there are some of us as well
[2821.74 --> 2823.68]  for whom right now,
[2823.68 --> 2827.16]  the quiet feels heavier.
[2828.52 --> 2830.80]  Some of us come after Christmas
[2830.80 --> 2832.90]  feeling full and grateful,
[2833.52 --> 2835.66]  and others come feeling tired
[2835.66 --> 2837.08]  and overwhelmed,
[2838.08 --> 2840.78]  maybe even a little disappointed
[2840.78 --> 2842.64]  and let down.
[2843.10 --> 2845.56]  Things didn't go the way we wanted them to.
[2845.56 --> 2848.20]  And if that's you,
[2848.78 --> 2850.94]  or if you have a sense
[2850.94 --> 2852.66]  that that might become you,
[2853.10 --> 2856.42]  I want to speak gently to you this morning.
[2857.52 --> 2858.00]  Right?
[2858.10 --> 2859.78]  For some of us in this moment,
[2859.96 --> 2862.76]  Christmas is a reminder of sadness.
[2863.60 --> 2865.40]  It's a reminder of who's missing.
[2866.38 --> 2869.22]  And it's a feeling that really doesn't fade
[2869.22 --> 2871.10]  just because people have started
[2871.10 --> 2872.50]  making New Year's Eve plans,
[2872.50 --> 2874.22]  and they're moving to the next party,
[2874.46 --> 2875.32]  and there you are.
[2877.60 --> 2879.54]  Christmas can stir up grief
[2879.54 --> 2880.64]  and absence
[2880.64 --> 2882.96]  and this deep sense of loneliness.
[2884.82 --> 2886.20]  And beneath it all
[2886.20 --> 2887.40]  is a question
[2887.40 --> 2889.66]  that every one of us
[2889.66 --> 2891.88]  kind of has to answer,
[2892.08 --> 2894.04]  but rarely asks out loud.
[2894.30 --> 2896.36]  We all kind of feel it in this moment.
[2897.32 --> 2898.00]  Now what?
[2899.86 --> 2902.36]  What has Christmas actually changed?
[2903.48 --> 2905.66]  Is anything really different now?
[2907.14 --> 2907.36]  Right?
[2907.40 --> 2909.38]  Everyone's going back to the same routines,
[2909.60 --> 2910.62]  the same responsibilities,
[2910.92 --> 2911.76]  the same pressures.
[2912.28 --> 2915.12]  Is that really all that happens after Christmas?
[2916.88 --> 2919.56]  Or has something deeper
[2919.56 --> 2921.32]  actually taken place?
[2922.16 --> 2923.82]  Something that doesn't disappear
[2923.82 --> 2924.94]  when the music fades
[2924.94 --> 2927.32]  or when the decorations go down?
[2927.32 --> 2929.38]  This morning,
[2929.68 --> 2931.56]  I want to look for us
[2931.56 --> 2932.66]  and with us
[2932.66 --> 2934.32]  at a short verse,
[2934.42 --> 2935.54]  actually a phrase
[2935.54 --> 2937.92]  within that short verse.
[2939.14 --> 2939.98]  Luke 2,
[2940.36 --> 2941.68]  as many of you
[2941.68 --> 2942.76]  no doubt are aware,
[2942.90 --> 2943.78]  is the story
[2943.78 --> 2945.58]  of the birth of Jesus.
[2945.58 --> 2948.26]  Because of the census,
[2948.68 --> 2949.88]  Joseph took his family
[2949.88 --> 2950.82]  to Bethlehem.
[2951.24 --> 2951.86]  While there,
[2952.06 --> 2953.16]  the baby is born
[2953.16 --> 2954.52]  and there are shepherds
[2954.52 --> 2956.00]  out in a field nearby
[2956.00 --> 2957.56]  and a host of angels
[2957.56 --> 2958.60]  appear to them,
[2958.98 --> 2960.04]  tell them about the birth
[2960.04 --> 2960.64]  of the Savior,
[2960.84 --> 2961.64]  about the Messiah.
[2961.96 --> 2962.82]  They rush off
[2962.82 --> 2963.66]  to find him
[2963.66 --> 2964.42]  and his parents
[2964.42 --> 2965.62]  just as they were told
[2965.62 --> 2967.20]  laying in a manger.
[2967.44 --> 2968.44]  And then they left
[2968.44 --> 2969.54]  telling everyone
[2969.54 --> 2970.66]  what they had heard
[2970.66 --> 2971.28]  and seen.
[2971.28 --> 2971.96]  And we read
[2971.96 --> 2973.04]  that Mary treasured
[2973.04 --> 2973.96]  up all these things
[2973.96 --> 2974.60]  in her heart.
[2974.74 --> 2975.24]  And then,
[2975.72 --> 2976.40]  verse 20,
[2977.76 --> 2979.18]  the shepherds returned,
[2980.32 --> 2982.10]  glorifying and praising God
[2982.10 --> 2983.22]  for all the things
[2983.22 --> 2984.48]  that they had heard
[2984.48 --> 2985.38]  and seen,
[2985.76 --> 2986.70]  which was just
[2986.70 --> 2988.52]  as they had been told.
[2989.96 --> 2990.62]  This is the word
[2990.62 --> 2991.04]  of the Lord.
[2993.64 --> 2994.62]  Luke 2,
[2994.84 --> 2995.48]  20,
[2996.06 --> 2996.70]  answers
[2996.70 --> 2998.08]  the now what
[2998.08 --> 2998.80]  question,
[2999.38 --> 3000.44]  the after Christmas
[3000.44 --> 3001.30]  question,
[3001.54 --> 3002.60]  with a single
[3002.60 --> 3004.84]  unassuming word.
[3006.06 --> 3007.00]  The shepherds
[3007.00 --> 3008.66]  returned.
[3010.56 --> 3011.56]  They returned.
[3012.94 --> 3013.96]  Now, Luke doesn't tell us
[3013.96 --> 3014.60]  how they felt.
[3015.76 --> 3016.56]  He doesn't tell us
[3016.56 --> 3017.88]  how long the wonder
[3017.88 --> 3018.68]  lasted
[3018.68 --> 3020.52]  or whether the whole night
[3020.52 --> 3021.82]  stayed magical.
[3022.20 --> 3023.10]  All he tells us
[3023.10 --> 3024.12]  is that they returned.
[3025.48 --> 3026.90]  And in that small
[3026.90 --> 3028.54]  unassuming word,
[3028.84 --> 3029.94]  Luke shows us,
[3029.94 --> 3030.64]  I think,
[3030.72 --> 3031.78]  what comes next
[3031.78 --> 3033.26]  after God shows up.
[3034.46 --> 3035.88]  That single word,
[3036.16 --> 3036.54]  returned,
[3036.86 --> 3038.46]  carries an incredible
[3038.46 --> 3039.56]  amount of weight.
[3040.60 --> 3041.78]  And it teaches us
[3041.78 --> 3042.62]  that the good news
[3042.62 --> 3043.18]  of Christmas
[3043.18 --> 3044.08]  does not end
[3044.08 --> 3045.72]  with everything stable,
[3046.10 --> 3047.60]  but in returning
[3047.60 --> 3048.42]  to the ordinary.
[3050.00 --> 3050.92]  What I would like
[3050.92 --> 3052.00]  to do with you
[3052.00 --> 3052.60]  this Sunday
[3052.60 --> 3053.52]  after Christmas
[3053.52 --> 3055.12]  is to plumb
[3055.12 --> 3055.88]  the depths
[3055.88 --> 3057.50]  of that little phrase,
[3057.50 --> 3058.74]  the shepherds
[3058.74 --> 3059.26]  returned,
[3060.06 --> 3061.24]  and to see
[3061.24 --> 3062.42]  how it reshapes
[3062.42 --> 3063.18]  our understanding
[3063.18 --> 3063.72]  of faith
[3063.72 --> 3064.74]  and worship
[3064.74 --> 3066.32]  and even ordinary life
[3066.32 --> 3067.60]  after God
[3067.60 --> 3068.36]  has come near.
[3069.70 --> 3070.62]  Let's start
[3070.62 --> 3071.72]  with our first
[3071.72 --> 3072.78]  idea.
[3073.34 --> 3073.92]  The first idea
[3073.92 --> 3074.62]  is that Christmas
[3074.62 --> 3076.06]  doesn't end
[3076.06 --> 3077.16]  with everything
[3077.16 --> 3078.28]  stable.
[3079.64 --> 3081.10]  Christmas doesn't end
[3081.10 --> 3081.82]  with everything
[3081.82 --> 3082.36]  stable,
[3082.48 --> 3083.54]  and this is
[3083.54 --> 3084.22]  good news.
[3084.22 --> 3086.58]  Luke tells us
[3086.58 --> 3087.28]  that the shepherds
[3087.28 --> 3087.72]  returned,
[3088.38 --> 3089.64]  and honestly,
[3090.00 --> 3091.22]  maybe that's
[3091.22 --> 3091.96]  a little disappointing
[3091.96 --> 3092.60]  to you.
[3093.78 --> 3094.88]  After the angels,
[3095.04 --> 3095.76]  after the glory,
[3095.90 --> 3096.72]  after the good news
[3096.72 --> 3097.40]  of great joy,
[3097.54 --> 3098.20]  after standing
[3098.20 --> 3099.56]  before the Christ child,
[3100.62 --> 3101.36]  maybe we want
[3101.36 --> 3102.08]  a little bit more.
[3103.56 --> 3104.12]  But Luke doesn't
[3104.12 --> 3104.70]  give us that.
[3105.38 --> 3106.16]  He doesn't tell us
[3106.16 --> 3106.92]  that the shepherds
[3106.92 --> 3107.94]  escaped their
[3107.94 --> 3109.00]  ordinary lives,
[3109.14 --> 3110.00]  that they went on
[3110.00 --> 3110.98]  to do great things
[3110.98 --> 3112.06]  and become great people.
[3112.30 --> 3113.04]  He tells us
[3113.04 --> 3114.00]  that they went back
[3114.00 --> 3115.28]  to their ordinary
[3115.28 --> 3115.76]  lives.
[3116.72 --> 3117.52]  They return
[3117.52 --> 3118.42]  to the same fields,
[3118.60 --> 3119.64]  to the same night air,
[3119.74 --> 3120.52]  to the same work,
[3120.68 --> 3122.28]  to the same responsibilities.
[3122.44 --> 3123.46]  There's no indication
[3123.46 --> 3125.30]  that their circumstances
[3125.30 --> 3126.10]  changed.
[3127.54 --> 3128.44]  There's no promotion.
[3129.06 --> 3130.06]  There's no relief
[3130.06 --> 3130.88]  from the hardship
[3130.88 --> 3131.66]  of their life.
[3131.86 --> 3132.80]  There's no permanent
[3132.80 --> 3133.80]  spiritual high
[3133.80 --> 3134.48]  that lifts them
[3134.48 --> 3135.48]  above the realities
[3135.48 --> 3136.76]  of life beyond
[3136.76 --> 3137.28]  the moment
[3137.28 --> 3137.74]  that they have
[3137.74 --> 3138.40]  just witnessed.
[3138.80 --> 3140.10]  Christmas doesn't
[3140.10 --> 3141.06]  rescue them
[3141.06 --> 3142.38]  from ordinary
[3142.38 --> 3143.48]  existence.
[3144.00 --> 3147.30]  And that,
[3147.72 --> 3148.72]  Luke suggests,
[3149.54 --> 3151.06]  is not the failure
[3151.06 --> 3152.30]  of the story.
[3153.20 --> 3154.24]  It's the point
[3154.24 --> 3154.84]  of the story.
[3156.48 --> 3157.68]  Because if Christmas
[3157.68 --> 3158.80]  only mattered
[3158.80 --> 3160.02]  in the stable,
[3160.42 --> 3161.64]  if it only worked
[3161.64 --> 3162.88]  in moments of wonder
[3162.88 --> 3163.98]  and of holiness,
[3164.26 --> 3165.62]  then it would collapse
[3165.62 --> 3166.86]  the moment we step
[3166.86 --> 3167.90]  back into real life.
[3167.90 --> 3169.82]  If the gospel
[3169.82 --> 3171.38]  required sustained
[3171.38 --> 3172.68]  emotional intensity
[3172.68 --> 3174.70]  and uninterrupted peace
[3174.70 --> 3175.62]  and dramatically
[3175.62 --> 3177.02]  changed circumstances,
[3177.02 --> 3178.72]  it would be unbearable
[3178.72 --> 3179.88]  for most of us.
[3180.72 --> 3181.88]  But especially
[3181.88 --> 3182.58]  for those of us
[3182.58 --> 3183.52]  who are carrying grief,
[3184.66 --> 3185.68]  especially for those
[3185.68 --> 3186.36]  of us who are living
[3186.36 --> 3187.04]  in disappointment
[3187.04 --> 3188.48]  and exhaustion,
[3189.60 --> 3190.56]  Luke instead
[3190.56 --> 3191.62]  shows us
[3191.62 --> 3192.66]  something stronger,
[3193.42 --> 3194.54]  something sturdier.
[3194.54 --> 3196.04]  Christmas doesn't
[3196.04 --> 3197.60]  remove the shepherds
[3197.60 --> 3198.60]  from reality.
[3198.92 --> 3199.36]  Christmas
[3199.36 --> 3200.72]  reinterprets
[3200.72 --> 3201.44]  reality.
[3202.40 --> 3202.94]  The fields
[3202.94 --> 3203.72]  don't disappear,
[3204.22 --> 3205.34]  they are returned
[3205.34 --> 3205.70]  to,
[3205.80 --> 3206.68]  and they are returned
[3206.68 --> 3208.30]  to with a new
[3208.30 --> 3209.04]  orientation,
[3209.26 --> 3210.34]  a new perspective,
[3210.48 --> 3211.22]  a new weight
[3211.22 --> 3212.02]  of meaning
[3212.02 --> 3213.52]  because God
[3213.52 --> 3214.58]  has come near.
[3214.58 --> 3217.22]  This is good news
[3217.22 --> 3217.72]  for us.
[3217.84 --> 3218.54]  It means that
[3218.54 --> 3219.96]  the truth of Christmas
[3219.96 --> 3220.90]  doesn't depend
[3220.90 --> 3221.88]  on how long
[3221.88 --> 3223.12]  the music lasts
[3223.12 --> 3224.50]  or how strong
[3224.50 --> 3225.28]  your feelings
[3225.28 --> 3226.56]  about it might be,
[3226.86 --> 3227.04]  right,
[3227.06 --> 3227.72]  or how quickly
[3227.72 --> 3228.94]  your life improves.
[3229.94 --> 3230.78]  It means that
[3230.78 --> 3231.26]  when the lights
[3231.26 --> 3231.88]  come down
[3231.88 --> 3232.64]  and the routines
[3232.64 --> 3233.52]  return,
[3233.82 --> 3234.44]  that Christmas
[3234.44 --> 3235.44]  hasn't failed
[3235.44 --> 3236.84]  but has begun
[3236.84 --> 3238.50]  a deeper work.
[3239.72 --> 3240.46]  The gospel
[3240.46 --> 3241.20]  doesn't promise
[3241.20 --> 3242.18]  escape from
[3242.18 --> 3243.28]  ordinary life,
[3243.30 --> 3243.96]  it promises
[3243.96 --> 3245.12]  God's presence
[3245.12 --> 3246.10]  in the midst
[3246.10 --> 3247.22]  of ordinary life.
[3250.46 --> 3251.52]  Most of us
[3251.52 --> 3252.30]  might know
[3252.30 --> 3252.80]  the feeling
[3252.80 --> 3253.72]  of coming home
[3253.72 --> 3255.84]  after a good trip,
[3256.10 --> 3257.44]  an excellent vacation.
[3258.10 --> 3258.72]  The bags
[3258.72 --> 3259.26]  are still
[3259.26 --> 3260.00]  by the door,
[3260.18 --> 3260.66]  the pictures
[3260.66 --> 3261.26]  are still
[3261.26 --> 3261.98]  on our phones,
[3262.08 --> 3262.56]  we haven't even
[3262.56 --> 3263.04]  had a chance
[3263.04 --> 3263.98]  to upload them
[3263.98 --> 3265.34]  to Instagram yet,
[3265.50 --> 3267.42]  but the alarm
[3267.42 --> 3267.98]  is set
[3267.98 --> 3269.38]  for tomorrow morning
[3269.38 --> 3271.12]  and you've already
[3271.12 --> 3271.86]  glimpsed at your
[3271.86 --> 3273.00]  work emails
[3273.00 --> 3273.56]  and you know
[3273.56 --> 3274.18]  that your inbox
[3274.18 --> 3274.64]  is full.
[3276.18 --> 3277.10]  A good vacation
[3277.10 --> 3278.22]  can refresh you
[3278.22 --> 3279.34]  but it can't
[3279.34 --> 3280.40]  replace your life.
[3282.14 --> 3282.58]  Christmas,
[3282.86 --> 3283.66]  if we misunderstand
[3283.66 --> 3284.32]  it,
[3284.36 --> 3285.28]  can feel like that.
[3285.32 --> 3286.42]  A beautiful interruption
[3286.42 --> 3287.36]  that we enjoy
[3287.36 --> 3288.48]  and then we have
[3288.48 --> 3289.16]  to leave behind.
[3291.34 --> 3292.20]  But Christmas,
[3292.52 --> 3293.06]  the way Luke
[3293.06 --> 3294.00]  is describing it here,
[3294.20 --> 3295.32]  isn't a getaway.
[3295.58 --> 3296.24]  The shepherds
[3296.24 --> 3297.26]  do not return
[3297.26 --> 3298.24]  because the magic
[3298.24 --> 3299.04]  wore off,
[3299.20 --> 3299.90]  the shepherds
[3299.90 --> 3300.64]  return because
[3300.64 --> 3301.94]  God has met them
[3301.94 --> 3302.76]  in a way
[3302.76 --> 3303.72]  that they now
[3303.72 --> 3305.04]  carry with them.
[3306.24 --> 3306.88]  Christmas isn't
[3306.88 --> 3307.40]  this break
[3307.40 --> 3308.32]  from reality.
[3308.90 --> 3309.48]  God breaking
[3309.48 --> 3310.50]  into the world
[3310.50 --> 3311.52]  isn't a pause
[3311.52 --> 3312.32]  on what's happening
[3312.32 --> 3313.14]  but it is
[3313.14 --> 3314.06]  what's happening.
[3314.16 --> 3314.74]  It's the moment
[3314.74 --> 3315.50]  that reality
[3315.50 --> 3316.80]  begins to be told
[3316.80 --> 3318.30]  with a new truth.
[3319.20 --> 3319.60]  Christmas
[3319.60 --> 3320.62]  transforms
[3320.62 --> 3322.46]  your reality.
[3324.52 --> 3325.40]  Which then
[3325.40 --> 3326.06]  takes us
[3326.06 --> 3327.80]  to the second point,
[3327.88 --> 3328.02]  right?
[3328.02 --> 3328.62]  The shepherds
[3328.62 --> 3329.88]  returned to their fields,
[3329.98 --> 3331.22]  to their ordinary life
[3331.22 --> 3332.78]  with a new song
[3332.78 --> 3333.60]  on their hearts.
[3334.26 --> 3335.40]  They returned
[3335.40 --> 3336.50]  glorifying
[3336.50 --> 3337.76]  and praising
[3337.76 --> 3338.78]  God.
[3339.84 --> 3340.76]  Now that matters
[3340.76 --> 3342.80]  because praise
[3342.80 --> 3344.42]  in this moment
[3344.42 --> 3345.76]  is not denial
[3345.76 --> 3347.32]  and it's not
[3347.32 --> 3347.96]  distraction,
[3348.32 --> 3349.34]  right?
[3349.38 --> 3349.94]  The shepherds
[3349.94 --> 3351.14]  aren't praising God
[3351.14 --> 3352.54]  because their fields
[3352.54 --> 3353.80]  have become easier,
[3354.18 --> 3354.90]  the sheep
[3354.90 --> 3355.94]  are getting lost
[3355.94 --> 3356.94]  less often,
[3356.94 --> 3357.70]  the work
[3357.70 --> 3358.76]  has not disappeared.
[3359.22 --> 3359.58]  They're not
[3359.58 --> 3360.44]  praising God
[3360.44 --> 3361.28]  because the world
[3361.28 --> 3362.28]  suddenly feels
[3362.28 --> 3363.86]  safe and predictable,
[3364.26 --> 3365.16]  they're praising
[3365.16 --> 3366.34]  God
[3366.34 --> 3367.26]  because they have
[3367.26 --> 3368.78]  seen their God,
[3368.88 --> 3369.52]  they have met
[3369.52 --> 3370.56]  their Messiah
[3370.56 --> 3371.64]  and their Savior.
[3372.12 --> 3373.36]  Praising and glorifying
[3373.36 --> 3374.48]  is a new way
[3374.48 --> 3375.28]  of inhabiting
[3375.28 --> 3376.06]  the same
[3376.06 --> 3377.52]  ordinary life.
[3378.58 --> 3379.22]  The fields
[3379.22 --> 3379.96]  are still dark,
[3380.06 --> 3380.42]  the work
[3380.42 --> 3381.22]  is still hard,
[3381.50 --> 3382.12]  the world
[3382.12 --> 3382.90]  in this moment
[3382.90 --> 3383.72]  is still ruled
[3383.72 --> 3384.40]  by Rome,
[3384.58 --> 3385.52]  Herod is still
[3385.52 --> 3386.90]  raging on his
[3386.90 --> 3388.52]  throne in Judea,
[3388.72 --> 3389.58]  nothing about
[3389.58 --> 3390.26]  the external
[3390.26 --> 3391.72]  situation has changed
[3391.72 --> 3392.44]  and yet
[3392.44 --> 3393.24]  everything
[3393.24 --> 3394.64]  has changed
[3394.64 --> 3396.46]  because God
[3396.46 --> 3397.04]  has shown up,
[3397.76 --> 3398.48]  God has shown
[3398.48 --> 3399.08]  himself to be
[3399.08 --> 3399.44]  faithful,
[3400.20 --> 3401.26]  God has proved
[3401.26 --> 3402.14]  his promises
[3402.14 --> 3403.08]  true,
[3403.22 --> 3403.96]  he has kept
[3403.96 --> 3404.62]  his word,
[3404.72 --> 3405.36]  he's promised
[3405.36 --> 3406.72]  and he has done
[3406.72 --> 3408.04]  exactly what
[3408.04 --> 3409.06]  he promised.
[3410.48 --> 3411.48]  This is the
[3411.48 --> 3412.40]  difference between
[3412.40 --> 3413.50]  what we can call
[3413.50 --> 3414.60]  Christmas praise
[3414.60 --> 3416.24]  and mere
[3416.24 --> 3416.92]  optimism.
[3418.28 --> 3418.38]  Right,
[3418.50 --> 3419.64]  optimism depends
[3419.64 --> 3420.40]  on your
[3420.40 --> 3421.18]  circumstances
[3421.18 --> 3421.94]  improving.
[3423.54 --> 3424.68]  Praise rests
[3424.68 --> 3425.56]  on God
[3425.56 --> 3426.36]  revealing himself
[3426.36 --> 3427.06]  to be trustworthy
[3427.06 --> 3429.68]  and the shepherds
[3429.68 --> 3431.02]  praise and glorify
[3431.02 --> 3432.08]  not because their
[3432.08 --> 3432.98]  lives are easier
[3432.98 --> 3433.78]  but because their
[3433.78 --> 3434.78]  lives now make
[3434.78 --> 3436.20]  a new sense
[3436.20 --> 3438.36]  in light of
[3438.36 --> 3438.82]  what God
[3438.82 --> 3439.46]  has done
[3439.46 --> 3440.90]  in this moment
[3440.90 --> 3442.02]  and this praise
[3442.02 --> 3443.10]  doesn't float
[3443.10 --> 3444.62]  above reality
[3444.62 --> 3445.96]  disconnected to it,
[3446.00 --> 3447.10]  it settles into it.
[3447.52 --> 3447.84]  Right,
[3447.88 --> 3448.78]  it doesn't erase
[3448.78 --> 3450.44]  sorrow or fatigue
[3450.44 --> 3451.34]  or fear,
[3451.54 --> 3452.78]  it doesn't take away
[3452.78 --> 3453.78]  grief but rather
[3453.78 --> 3454.72]  it carries
[3454.72 --> 3455.46]  them.
[3456.38 --> 3457.26]  It gives weight
[3457.26 --> 3458.32]  and meaning
[3458.32 --> 3459.64]  in the presence
[3459.64 --> 3460.34]  of a faithful
[3460.34 --> 3460.78]  God.
[3461.98 --> 3462.88]  In your grief,
[3463.28 --> 3464.00]  praise.
[3465.00 --> 3466.36]  In your wonder,
[3466.92 --> 3467.40]  glorify.
[3467.62 --> 3468.46]  In your questioning,
[3469.04 --> 3469.32]  worship.
[3469.32 --> 3470.76]  In your deconstruction,
[3471.16 --> 3471.42]  pray.
[3471.62 --> 3472.44]  In your work
[3472.44 --> 3473.76]  and in your worry,
[3473.96 --> 3474.68]  sing praises
[3474.68 --> 3475.46]  to God.
[3475.60 --> 3476.42]  Worship is not
[3476.42 --> 3477.04]  what happens
[3477.04 --> 3477.92]  only in that
[3477.92 --> 3479.00]  moment of
[3479.00 --> 3479.60]  revelation
[3479.60 --> 3481.22]  or only here
[3481.22 --> 3482.04]  on Sundays.
[3482.54 --> 3483.42]  Worship follows
[3483.42 --> 3484.02]  us back
[3484.02 --> 3484.94]  into ordinary
[3484.94 --> 3485.72]  life
[3485.72 --> 3487.14]  once God
[3487.14 --> 3487.72]  has made
[3487.72 --> 3488.48]  himself known.
[3489.30 --> 3490.46]  All of life
[3490.46 --> 3491.86]  becomes worship
[3491.86 --> 3493.18]  because God
[3493.18 --> 3493.84]  has entered
[3493.84 --> 3494.80]  into all
[3494.80 --> 3495.40]  of life.
[3497.70 --> 3498.66]  Which then is
[3498.66 --> 3499.84]  the third step
[3499.84 --> 3500.32]  of this
[3500.32 --> 3501.32]  argument
[3501.32 --> 3501.84]  that I'm
[3501.84 --> 3502.80]  building for you.
[3502.88 --> 3503.38]  The shepherds
[3503.38 --> 3504.54]  returned glorifying
[3504.54 --> 3505.02]  and praising
[3505.02 --> 3505.46]  God
[3505.46 --> 3506.28]  for all
[3506.28 --> 3506.62]  that they
[3506.62 --> 3507.18]  had seen
[3507.18 --> 3508.12]  just as
[3508.12 --> 3508.74]  they had
[3508.74 --> 3509.58]  been told.
[3510.80 --> 3511.30]  Returning
[3511.30 --> 3512.42]  to the
[3512.42 --> 3513.02]  ordinary
[3513.02 --> 3513.90]  rests
[3513.90 --> 3514.94]  on the
[3514.94 --> 3515.46]  reliability
[3515.46 --> 3517.18]  of God.
[3519.58 --> 3520.90]  That phrase
[3520.90 --> 3522.26]  just as
[3522.26 --> 3522.62]  they had
[3522.62 --> 3523.36]  been told
[3523.36 --> 3524.38]  tells us
[3524.38 --> 3524.94]  where the
[3524.94 --> 3525.80]  weight
[3525.80 --> 3526.62]  of their
[3526.62 --> 3527.52]  praise
[3527.52 --> 3528.32]  actually
[3528.32 --> 3529.62]  rests.
[3531.50 --> 3531.74]  Their
[3531.74 --> 3532.12]  worship
[3532.12 --> 3532.60]  isn't
[3532.60 --> 3532.94]  grounded
[3532.94 --> 3533.78]  in novelty.
[3535.02 --> 3535.26]  Their
[3535.26 --> 3535.60]  worship
[3535.60 --> 3536.00]  isn't
[3536.00 --> 3536.64]  sustained
[3536.64 --> 3537.12]  by
[3537.12 --> 3537.66]  a
[3537.66 --> 3537.98]  peaked
[3537.98 --> 3538.62]  emotion.
[3539.74 --> 3539.88]  Their
[3539.88 --> 3540.24]  worship
[3540.24 --> 3540.72]  isn't
[3540.72 --> 3541.24]  dependent
[3541.24 --> 3541.90]  upon
[3541.90 --> 3542.36]  a
[3542.36 --> 3542.84]  particular
[3542.84 --> 3543.56]  atmosphere.
[3544.26 --> 3544.40]  Their
[3544.40 --> 3544.82]  worship
[3544.82 --> 3546.64]  is
[3546.64 --> 3547.50]  built
[3547.50 --> 3548.14]  on
[3548.14 --> 3548.60]  and
[3548.60 --> 3549.06]  comes
[3549.06 --> 3549.48]  out
[3549.48 --> 3550.08]  of
[3550.08 --> 3550.66]  the
[3550.66 --> 3551.38]  reliability
[3551.38 --> 3552.66]  of
[3552.66 --> 3553.36]  God.
[3554.12 --> 3554.48]  The
[3554.48 --> 3555.44]  immutability
[3555.44 --> 3556.16]  of God.
[3556.26 --> 3556.40]  The
[3556.40 --> 3557.32]  unchanging
[3557.32 --> 3558.84]  faithfulness
[3558.84 --> 3559.24]  of
[3559.24 --> 3559.94]  God.
[3560.04 --> 3560.36]  His
[3560.36 --> 3560.90]  covenant
[3560.90 --> 3561.60]  loyalty
[3561.60 --> 3562.16]  to
[3562.16 --> 3562.74]  his
[3562.74 --> 3563.20]  people
[3563.20 --> 3563.56]  and
[3563.56 --> 3563.90]  his
[3563.90 --> 3564.48]  promises
[3564.48 --> 3565.30]  as an
[3565.30 --> 3565.68]  expression
[3565.68 --> 3566.42]  of his
[3566.42 --> 3567.12]  faithfulness
[3567.12 --> 3567.52]  to his
[3567.52 --> 3567.90]  own
[3567.90 --> 3568.74]  identity
[3568.74 --> 3569.40]  and
[3569.40 --> 3569.76]  being.
[3570.60 --> 3570.88]  The
[3570.88 --> 3571.32]  shepherds
[3571.32 --> 3571.70]  praised
[3571.70 --> 3572.14]  God
[3572.14 --> 3572.46]  because
[3572.46 --> 3573.14]  what they
[3573.14 --> 3573.34]  were
[3573.34 --> 3573.86]  promised
[3573.86 --> 3574.34]  turns
[3574.34 --> 3574.58]  out
[3574.58 --> 3574.88]  to be
[3574.88 --> 3575.18]  true.
[3576.14 --> 3576.36]  God
[3576.36 --> 3576.94]  spoke
[3576.94 --> 3577.28]  and
[3577.28 --> 3577.54]  God
[3577.54 --> 3578.04]  acted.
[3578.40 --> 3578.50]  What
[3578.50 --> 3578.68]  the
[3578.68 --> 3579.22]  angels
[3579.22 --> 3579.78]  announced
[3579.78 --> 3580.24]  was not
[3580.24 --> 3580.52]  just
[3580.52 --> 3580.88]  some
[3580.88 --> 3581.50]  symbolic
[3581.50 --> 3582.22]  reality
[3582.22 --> 3582.64]  or
[3582.64 --> 3582.88]  some
[3582.88 --> 3583.82]  aspirational
[3583.82 --> 3584.56]  goal.
[3584.78 --> 3585.02]  It
[3585.02 --> 3585.98]  corresponded
[3585.98 --> 3586.30]  to
[3586.30 --> 3586.86]  the
[3586.86 --> 3587.50]  created
[3587.50 --> 3588.06]  order.
[3588.60 --> 3588.76]  The
[3588.76 --> 3589.12]  child
[3589.12 --> 3589.52]  was
[3589.52 --> 3589.86]  there.
[3589.98 --> 3590.08]  The
[3590.08 --> 3590.48]  promise
[3590.48 --> 3591.08]  was
[3591.08 --> 3591.44]  kept.
[3591.56 --> 3591.78]  This
[3591.78 --> 3592.10]  is
[3592.10 --> 3592.88]  real
[3592.88 --> 3593.34]  and
[3593.34 --> 3593.84]  that's
[3593.84 --> 3594.12]  why
[3594.12 --> 3594.40]  their
[3594.40 --> 3595.04]  praise
[3595.04 --> 3595.30]  can
[3595.30 --> 3595.68]  follow
[3595.68 --> 3595.92]  them
[3595.92 --> 3596.18]  back
[3596.18 --> 3596.38]  to
[3596.38 --> 3596.56]  the
[3596.56 --> 3597.02]  fields.
[3598.74 --> 3599.40]  It
[3599.40 --> 3599.68]  doesn't
[3599.68 --> 3600.18]  require
[3600.18 --> 3600.94]  angels
[3600.94 --> 3601.58]  to
[3601.58 --> 3601.98]  remain.
[3602.44 --> 3602.78]  It
[3602.78 --> 3603.00]  doesn't
[3603.00 --> 3603.40]  require
[3603.40 --> 3603.64]  the
[3603.64 --> 3603.88]  night
[3603.88 --> 3604.10]  to
[3604.10 --> 3604.34]  stay
[3604.34 --> 3604.62]  lit
[3604.62 --> 3604.88]  up
[3604.88 --> 3605.44]  with
[3605.44 --> 3605.68]  the
[3605.68 --> 3606.08]  stars.
[3606.30 --> 3606.38]  It
[3606.38 --> 3606.66]  doesn't
[3606.66 --> 3606.84]  even
[3606.84 --> 3607.38]  require
[3607.38 --> 3607.72]  your
[3607.72 --> 3608.20]  feelings
[3608.20 --> 3608.42]  to
[3608.42 --> 3608.68]  stay
[3608.68 --> 3609.54]  elevated.
[3609.54 --> 3610.18]  Praise
[3610.18 --> 3610.94]  endures
[3610.94 --> 3611.26]  because
[3611.26 --> 3611.70]  God
[3611.70 --> 3612.40]  himself
[3612.40 --> 3613.72]  is
[3613.72 --> 3614.14]  faithful.
[3615.48 --> 3616.14]  This
[3616.14 --> 3616.44]  is the
[3616.44 --> 3617.14]  reality
[3617.14 --> 3617.82]  defining
[3617.82 --> 3618.48]  grace
[3618.48 --> 3619.20]  that we
[3619.20 --> 3619.76]  are in
[3619.76 --> 3619.92]  the
[3619.92 --> 3620.14]  midst
[3620.14 --> 3620.44]  of.
[3620.54 --> 3620.82]  Christmas
[3620.82 --> 3621.30]  isn't
[3621.30 --> 3621.68]  simply
[3621.68 --> 3621.96]  a
[3621.96 --> 3622.42]  story
[3622.42 --> 3622.72]  that
[3622.72 --> 3623.12]  moves
[3623.12 --> 3623.44]  our
[3623.44 --> 3623.90]  hearts.
[3624.24 --> 3624.52]  It's
[3624.52 --> 3624.66]  a
[3624.66 --> 3625.10]  divine
[3625.10 --> 3625.56]  act
[3625.56 --> 3625.82]  of
[3625.82 --> 3626.22]  God
[3626.22 --> 3626.64]  that
[3626.64 --> 3627.12]  confirms
[3627.12 --> 3627.36]  a
[3627.36 --> 3627.72]  permanent
[3627.72 --> 3628.18]  truth
[3628.18 --> 3628.76]  about
[3628.76 --> 3628.94]  the
[3628.94 --> 3629.16]  world.
[3629.26 --> 3629.38]  That
[3629.38 --> 3629.76]  God
[3629.76 --> 3630.20]  keeps
[3630.20 --> 3630.56]  his
[3630.56 --> 3631.00]  word.
[3631.36 --> 3631.44]  That
[3631.44 --> 3631.78]  God
[3631.78 --> 3632.14]  enters
[3632.14 --> 3632.64]  history.
[3632.82 --> 3632.90]  That
[3632.90 --> 3633.20]  God
[3633.20 --> 3633.66]  saves
[3633.66 --> 3633.96]  his
[3633.96 --> 3634.70]  people.
[3634.90 --> 3635.00]  And
[3635.00 --> 3635.34]  since
[3635.34 --> 3635.70]  that
[3635.70 --> 3635.92]  is
[3635.92 --> 3636.36]  true,
[3636.36 --> 3637.46]  everything
[3637.46 --> 3638.00]  else,
[3638.26 --> 3638.96]  everything
[3638.96 --> 3639.80]  else must
[3639.80 --> 3640.50]  be interpreted
[3640.50 --> 3641.54]  by that
[3641.54 --> 3642.24]  truth.
[3643.20 --> 3643.38]  The
[3643.38 --> 3643.82]  shepherds'
[3643.90 --> 3644.28]  lives are
[3644.28 --> 3644.86]  not suddenly
[3644.86 --> 3645.54]  easier,
[3645.76 --> 3646.44]  but their
[3646.44 --> 3646.98]  lives are
[3646.98 --> 3647.42]  newly
[3647.42 --> 3648.06]  anchored.
[3649.12 --> 3649.48]  The
[3649.48 --> 3649.80]  world
[3649.80 --> 3650.28]  remains
[3650.28 --> 3650.66]  as it
[3650.66 --> 3651.02]  was,
[3651.14 --> 3651.66]  but God
[3651.66 --> 3652.10]  is now
[3652.10 --> 3653.16]  known as
[3653.16 --> 3653.74]  faithful
[3653.74 --> 3654.18]  within
[3654.18 --> 3654.44]  it.
[3655.90 --> 3656.50]  That's
[3656.50 --> 3657.06]  why our
[3657.06 --> 3657.48]  worship
[3657.48 --> 3657.90]  isn't
[3657.90 --> 3658.34]  fragile.
[3659.30 --> 3659.70]  It
[3659.70 --> 3659.98]  doesn't
[3659.98 --> 3660.52]  collapse
[3660.52 --> 3660.98]  when the
[3660.98 --> 3661.28]  feelings
[3661.28 --> 3661.84]  fade or
[3661.84 --> 3662.34]  when the
[3662.34 --> 3662.92]  circumstances
[3662.92 --> 3663.90]  disappointment
[3663.90 --> 3664.50]  because it's
[3664.50 --> 3665.18]  grounded in
[3665.18 --> 3665.74]  who God
[3665.74 --> 3666.72]  is and
[3666.72 --> 3667.08]  what God
[3667.08 --> 3667.52]  has done.
[3668.54 --> 3669.02]  Our
[3669.02 --> 3669.42]  praise
[3669.42 --> 3670.58]  moves us
[3670.58 --> 3670.88]  from
[3670.88 --> 3671.60]  needing
[3671.60 --> 3672.26]  the right
[3672.26 --> 3672.80]  mood
[3672.80 --> 3673.96]  to having
[3673.96 --> 3674.44]  the right
[3674.44 --> 3675.16]  metaphysics.
[3675.76 --> 3676.44]  Or to put it
[3676.44 --> 3676.86]  another way,
[3676.98 --> 3678.42]  from feeling
[3678.42 --> 3680.00]  to reality
[3680.00 --> 3680.90]  itself
[3680.90 --> 3681.54]  being
[3681.54 --> 3682.48]  redefined
[3682.48 --> 3683.08]  by God's
[3683.08 --> 3683.48]  actions.
[3686.62 --> 3686.96]  So,
[3687.66 --> 3690.40]  as we
[3690.40 --> 3690.80]  dig into
[3690.80 --> 3691.46]  this word
[3691.46 --> 3692.26]  returned,
[3692.90 --> 3693.44]  we've been
[3693.44 --> 3694.14]  forming a
[3694.14 --> 3694.66]  sort of
[3694.66 --> 3695.84]  three-step
[3695.84 --> 3696.66]  argument,
[3696.86 --> 3697.00]  right?
[3697.12 --> 3697.46]  God's
[3697.46 --> 3698.00]  coming
[3698.00 --> 3698.42]  doesn't
[3698.42 --> 3699.04]  necessarily
[3699.04 --> 3699.74]  mean our
[3699.74 --> 3700.42]  circumstances
[3700.42 --> 3700.96]  change.
[3701.38 --> 3701.86]  Ordinary
[3701.86 --> 3702.44]  life
[3702.44 --> 3703.36]  remains,
[3703.54 --> 3703.92]  but it
[3703.92 --> 3704.30]  remains
[3704.30 --> 3704.86]  with hope.
[3705.96 --> 3706.18]  The
[3706.18 --> 3706.52]  shepherds
[3706.52 --> 3707.00]  went back
[3707.00 --> 3707.36]  to
[3707.36 --> 3708.20]  routine,
[3708.44 --> 3708.66]  yet,
[3708.80 --> 3708.90]  in
[3708.90 --> 3709.52]  encountering
[3709.52 --> 3709.68]  their
[3709.68 --> 3710.10]  Messiah
[3710.10 --> 3710.36]  and
[3710.36 --> 3710.66]  Savior,
[3710.80 --> 3710.92]  in
[3710.92 --> 3711.28]  seeing
[3711.28 --> 3711.76]  God's
[3711.76 --> 3712.24]  nearness,
[3712.84 --> 3713.36]  that
[3713.36 --> 3714.24]  transformed
[3714.24 --> 3715.20]  how they
[3715.20 --> 3715.96]  see the
[3715.96 --> 3716.60]  ordinary.
[3716.84 --> 3716.92]  They
[3716.92 --> 3717.78]  glorified
[3717.78 --> 3718.56]  and praised,
[3718.94 --> 3719.28]  and that
[3719.28 --> 3720.18]  this praise
[3720.18 --> 3721.08]  now is
[3721.08 --> 3721.84]  anchored
[3721.84 --> 3722.34]  in
[3722.34 --> 3723.00]  God's
[3723.00 --> 3723.72]  character
[3723.72 --> 3724.64]  and his
[3724.64 --> 3725.28]  faithfulness,
[3725.36 --> 3725.72]  just as
[3725.72 --> 3725.84]  they
[3725.84 --> 3726.22]  have been
[3726.22 --> 3726.52]  told,
[3726.66 --> 3727.06]  not in
[3727.06 --> 3727.38]  fleeting
[3727.38 --> 3727.90]  feelings
[3727.90 --> 3728.30]  or in
[3728.30 --> 3728.64]  changed
[3728.64 --> 3729.32]  circumstances.
[3729.88 --> 3730.06]  Now,
[3730.08 --> 3730.26]  if we
[3730.26 --> 3730.72]  take all
[3730.72 --> 3731.10]  of those
[3731.10 --> 3731.44]  things
[3731.44 --> 3732.00]  together,
[3732.80 --> 3733.98]  that means
[3733.98 --> 3734.38]  that the
[3734.38 --> 3735.04]  good news
[3735.04 --> 3735.66]  of Christmas
[3735.66 --> 3736.46]  doesn't end
[3736.46 --> 3737.04]  with everything
[3737.04 --> 3737.66]  stable,
[3737.96 --> 3738.48]  but in
[3738.48 --> 3738.92]  returning
[3738.92 --> 3739.40]  to the
[3739.40 --> 3739.94]  ordinary,
[3740.62 --> 3741.28]  now
[3741.28 --> 3742.08]  turned
[3742.08 --> 3742.96]  extraordinary.
[3744.46 --> 3744.76]  That's
[3744.76 --> 3745.14]  the point
[3745.14 --> 3745.62]  of this.
[3746.22 --> 3746.56]  The
[3746.56 --> 3746.98]  good news
[3746.98 --> 3747.50]  of Christmas
[3747.50 --> 3748.14]  does not
[3748.14 --> 3748.60]  end with
[3748.60 --> 3748.98]  everything
[3748.98 --> 3749.58]  stable,
[3749.90 --> 3750.40]  but in
[3750.40 --> 3750.88]  returning
[3750.88 --> 3751.50]  to the
[3751.50 --> 3752.04]  ordinary,
[3752.04 --> 3752.96]  now
[3752.96 --> 3753.54]  turned
[3753.54 --> 3754.50]  extraordinary.
[3756.90 --> 3757.48]  Let me
[3757.48 --> 3757.72]  see if I
[3757.72 --> 3758.10]  can illustrate
[3758.10 --> 3758.50]  this.
[3761.00 --> 3761.56]  Consider,
[3762.26 --> 3762.70]  if you
[3762.70 --> 3763.04]  would,
[3763.32 --> 3764.10]  a simple
[3764.10 --> 3764.54]  morning
[3764.54 --> 3765.06]  routine.
[3765.22 --> 3765.60]  Maybe this
[3765.60 --> 3766.10]  is familiar
[3766.10 --> 3766.60]  to you.
[3767.30 --> 3767.88]  A cup
[3767.88 --> 3768.46]  of coffee
[3768.46 --> 3770.04]  and a few
[3770.04 --> 3770.98]  quiet moments
[3770.98 --> 3771.68]  with your
[3771.68 --> 3772.48]  Bible before
[3772.48 --> 3772.96]  the rest
[3772.96 --> 3773.18]  of the
[3773.18 --> 3773.78]  house wakes
[3773.78 --> 3774.04]  up.
[3775.44 --> 3775.92]  Now,
[3776.00 --> 3776.22]  on the
[3776.22 --> 3776.66]  surface,
[3776.82 --> 3777.02]  nothing
[3777.02 --> 3777.64]  has changed.
[3778.36 --> 3778.78]  Right?
[3778.78 --> 3779.12]  It's the
[3779.12 --> 3779.34]  same
[3779.34 --> 3779.72]  chair,
[3779.86 --> 3780.14]  it's the
[3780.14 --> 3780.32]  same
[3780.32 --> 3780.78]  spot
[3780.78 --> 3781.40]  at the
[3781.40 --> 3781.64]  kitchen
[3781.64 --> 3782.06]  table,
[3782.18 --> 3782.54]  it's the
[3782.54 --> 3782.82]  same
[3782.82 --> 3783.60]  well-loved
[3783.60 --> 3784.66]  Bible for
[3784.66 --> 3785.10]  the last
[3785.10 --> 3785.78]  five years
[3785.78 --> 3786.14]  of your
[3786.14 --> 3786.52]  life.
[3788.06 --> 3788.98]  But last
[3788.98 --> 3789.34]  night,
[3789.90 --> 3791.62]  your doctor
[3791.62 --> 3793.40]  called and
[3793.40 --> 3793.74]  said the
[3793.74 --> 3794.46]  test came
[3794.46 --> 3794.98]  back all
[3794.98 --> 3795.28]  clear.
[3797.04 --> 3797.84]  Or yesterday,
[3798.32 --> 3799.04]  your daughter
[3799.04 --> 3799.82]  called and
[3799.82 --> 3800.32]  said your
[3800.32 --> 3801.10]  grandson is
[3801.10 --> 3801.88]  coming home
[3801.88 --> 3802.70]  for Christmas
[3802.70 --> 3803.32]  and wants to
[3803.32 --> 3803.78]  talk to you
[3803.78 --> 3804.12]  about his
[3804.12 --> 3804.50]  newfound
[3804.50 --> 3804.92]  faith in
[3804.92 --> 3805.22]  Jesus.
[3805.22 --> 3805.36]  Jesus,
[3806.08 --> 3807.72]  suddenly that
[3807.72 --> 3808.62]  ordinary
[3808.62 --> 3809.50]  everyday
[3809.50 --> 3811.14]  routine feels
[3811.14 --> 3812.02]  charged with
[3812.02 --> 3812.74]  new meaning
[3812.74 --> 3813.44]  and new
[3813.44 --> 3813.92]  purpose.
[3815.32 --> 3815.64]  Suddenly,
[3815.86 --> 3816.46]  every sip
[3816.46 --> 3817.18]  of coffee,
[3817.32 --> 3817.86]  every line
[3817.86 --> 3818.26]  of scripture
[3818.26 --> 3818.92]  you read
[3818.92 --> 3819.96]  is imbued
[3819.96 --> 3820.72]  with awe
[3820.72 --> 3821.48]  and gratitude,
[3821.68 --> 3822.12]  is imbued
[3822.12 --> 3822.44]  with this
[3822.44 --> 3823.62]  longing to
[3823.62 --> 3824.08]  worship.
[3825.04 --> 3825.80]  The same
[3825.80 --> 3826.26]  sort of
[3826.26 --> 3827.02]  dynamic is
[3827.02 --> 3827.44]  at work
[3827.44 --> 3828.34]  this morning.
[3829.18 --> 3829.30]  Right?
[3829.34 --> 3829.92]  The shepherds
[3829.92 --> 3830.82]  return to
[3830.82 --> 3831.38]  the fields
[3831.38 --> 3832.30]  that haven't
[3832.30 --> 3832.86]  changed,
[3832.86 --> 3835.90]  but in
[3835.90 --> 3836.54]  the presence
[3836.54 --> 3837.10]  of God
[3837.10 --> 3837.80]  in Christ
[3837.80 --> 3838.36]  which has
[3838.36 --> 3839.48]  redefined
[3839.48 --> 3840.68]  their experience
[3840.68 --> 3840.98]  of the
[3840.98 --> 3841.36]  ordinary.
[3842.32 --> 3843.12]  Their work,
[3843.30 --> 3843.80]  their night
[3843.80 --> 3844.14]  watch,
[3844.24 --> 3844.96]  their surroundings
[3844.96 --> 3845.98]  are now seen
[3845.98 --> 3846.50]  through the
[3846.50 --> 3847.16]  lens of
[3847.16 --> 3847.62]  God's
[3847.62 --> 3848.36]  faithfulness.
[3849.24 --> 3849.86]  Life
[3849.86 --> 3850.84]  itself isn't
[3850.84 --> 3851.30]  magically
[3851.30 --> 3852.06]  easier,
[3852.90 --> 3853.52]  but it's
[3853.52 --> 3854.24]  transformed
[3854.24 --> 3855.14]  in
[3855.14 --> 3855.90]  significance.
[3856.94 --> 3857.40]  Ordinary
[3857.40 --> 3858.12]  things are
[3858.12 --> 3859.16]  now seen
[3859.16 --> 3860.16]  through
[3860.16 --> 3860.96]  extraordinary
[3860.96 --> 3862.36]  ways because
[3862.36 --> 3863.60]  God has
[3863.60 --> 3864.68]  come near
[3864.68 --> 3867.16]  because we
[3867.16 --> 3867.56]  have seen
[3867.56 --> 3868.24]  his glory,
[3868.74 --> 3869.52]  the glory
[3869.52 --> 3869.78]  of the
[3869.78 --> 3870.04]  one and
[3870.04 --> 3870.50]  only Son
[3870.50 --> 3871.00]  come from
[3871.00 --> 3871.42]  the Father
[3871.42 --> 3872.38]  full of
[3872.38 --> 3873.22]  grace and
[3873.22 --> 3873.58]  truth.
[3875.86 --> 3876.12]  Now,
[3876.44 --> 3878.36]  what does
[3878.36 --> 3878.64]  this mean
[3878.64 --> 3878.94]  for who
[3878.94 --> 3879.54]  God is
[3879.54 --> 3879.98]  and what
[3879.98 --> 3880.44]  God has
[3880.44 --> 3880.76]  done?
[3882.50 --> 3882.88]  It means
[3882.88 --> 3883.26]  that God
[3883.26 --> 3884.04]  doesn't merely
[3884.04 --> 3884.90]  visit the
[3884.90 --> 3885.60]  extraordinary,
[3886.18 --> 3886.70]  he meets
[3886.70 --> 3887.48]  the ordinary
[3887.48 --> 3889.06]  and in
[3889.06 --> 3889.50]  meeting the
[3889.50 --> 3889.84]  ordinary,
[3890.18 --> 3891.38]  he sanctifies
[3891.38 --> 3892.12]  it by
[3892.12 --> 3892.82]  his presence.
[3893.76 --> 3894.58]  The shepherds
[3894.58 --> 3895.76]  returned changed
[3895.76 --> 3896.32]  because the
[3896.32 --> 3897.02]  child they
[3897.02 --> 3897.74]  saw would
[3897.74 --> 3898.68]  one day
[3898.68 --> 3899.36]  walk those
[3899.36 --> 3900.18]  same ordinary
[3900.18 --> 3900.86]  roads that
[3900.86 --> 3901.30]  they walked.
[3901.36 --> 3901.60]  He would
[3901.60 --> 3902.08]  one day
[3902.08 --> 3903.20]  return again
[3903.20 --> 3903.66]  and again
[3903.66 --> 3904.04]  to these
[3904.04 --> 3904.96]  same ordinary
[3904.96 --> 3905.74]  places and
[3905.74 --> 3906.94]  finally he
[3906.94 --> 3907.54]  would end
[3907.54 --> 3908.32]  his life
[3908.32 --> 3909.14]  on a cross.
[3910.64 --> 3911.46]  Jesus doesn't
[3911.46 --> 3912.36]  simply share
[3912.36 --> 3913.06]  our life,
[3913.16 --> 3913.72]  he takes
[3913.72 --> 3914.64]  our place.
[3915.90 --> 3916.26]  The same
[3916.26 --> 3917.00]  Christ who
[3917.00 --> 3918.20]  lies in a
[3918.20 --> 3918.78]  manger would
[3918.78 --> 3919.22]  one day
[3919.22 --> 3919.94]  return to
[3919.94 --> 3920.72]  Jerusalem not
[3920.72 --> 3921.58]  to be praised
[3921.58 --> 3922.28]  but to be
[3922.28 --> 3923.22]  rejected so
[3923.22 --> 3923.78]  that ordinary
[3923.78 --> 3924.46]  sinners like
[3924.46 --> 3925.08]  you and me
[3925.08 --> 3925.46]  could be
[3925.46 --> 3926.70]  justified by
[3926.70 --> 3927.42]  God's grace.
[3928.06 --> 3928.82]  God enters
[3928.82 --> 3929.40]  the world
[3929.40 --> 3930.12]  at Christmas
[3930.12 --> 3931.42]  so that he
[3931.42 --> 3932.04]  could do
[3932.04 --> 3932.66]  what we
[3932.66 --> 3933.12]  can't.
[3934.06 --> 3934.90]  Jesus lives
[3934.90 --> 3935.62]  the life I
[3935.62 --> 3935.94]  should have
[3935.94 --> 3936.48]  lived and he
[3936.48 --> 3937.04]  dies the
[3937.04 --> 3937.74]  death that
[3937.74 --> 3938.28]  I deserved.
[3938.42 --> 3939.08]  Our ordinary
[3939.08 --> 3939.84]  is turned
[3939.84 --> 3940.44]  extraordinary
[3940.44 --> 3941.74]  because of
[3941.74 --> 3942.68]  the extraordinary
[3942.68 --> 3943.96]  grace of
[3943.96 --> 3944.30]  God.
[3945.40 --> 3946.02]  The good
[3946.02 --> 3946.96]  news of
[3946.96 --> 3948.40]  after Christmas
[3948.40 --> 3950.14]  meets us
[3950.14 --> 3951.06]  in the
[3951.06 --> 3952.00]  ordinary
[3952.00 --> 3953.90]  things and
[3953.90 --> 3954.68]  ways of
[3954.68 --> 3955.48]  life and
[3955.48 --> 3957.12]  secures our
[3957.12 --> 3958.10]  worship in
[3958.10 --> 3958.84]  those moments
[3958.84 --> 3959.84]  not in
[3959.84 --> 3961.04]  sentiment or
[3961.04 --> 3961.82]  in nostalgia
[3961.82 --> 3963.70]  but in the
[3963.70 --> 3964.70]  finished and
[3964.70 --> 3965.92]  completed work
[3965.92 --> 3966.68]  of Christ.
[3967.94 --> 3968.52]  Worship
[3968.52 --> 3969.38]  becomes the
[3969.38 --> 3970.34]  natural response
[3970.34 --> 3970.94]  of hearts
[3970.94 --> 3972.30]  anchored in
[3972.30 --> 3972.68]  God's
[3972.68 --> 3973.46]  faithfulness
[3973.46 --> 3974.38]  moving from
[3974.38 --> 3975.10]  these fleeting
[3975.10 --> 3976.04]  feelings to a
[3976.04 --> 3977.20]  reality of
[3977.20 --> 3977.62]  what God
[3977.62 --> 3978.28]  has accomplished
[3978.28 --> 3979.70]  for us in
[3979.70 --> 3980.82]  Jesus Christ.
[3982.66 --> 3983.48]  So as we
[3983.48 --> 3983.80]  think about
[3983.80 --> 3984.16]  what comes
[3984.16 --> 3985.14]  next I
[3985.14 --> 3985.44]  want to
[3985.44 --> 3986.18]  invite you
[3986.18 --> 3986.84]  for a
[3986.84 --> 3987.32]  moment to
[3987.32 --> 3988.42]  reflect quietly
[3988.42 --> 3988.90]  in your own
[3988.90 --> 3989.24]  heart.
[3991.14 --> 3991.74]  What does
[3991.74 --> 3993.08]  returning look
[3993.08 --> 3994.20]  like in
[3994.20 --> 3994.80]  your life
[3994.80 --> 3995.34]  this next
[3995.34 --> 3995.62]  week?
[3997.32 --> 3998.14]  Where are
[3998.14 --> 3998.72]  you being
[3998.72 --> 3999.44]  sent to
[3999.44 --> 4000.44]  the ordinary
[4000.44 --> 4001.26]  and how
[4001.26 --> 4001.80]  might God
[4001.80 --> 4002.38]  be present
[4002.38 --> 4002.68]  there?
[4004.18 --> 4005.14]  Or to put
[4005.14 --> 4005.44]  a different
[4005.44 --> 4006.02]  spin on it
[4006.02 --> 4006.78]  what have
[4006.78 --> 4007.12]  you been
[4007.12 --> 4007.58]  hoping
[4007.58 --> 4008.06]  Christmas
[4008.06 --> 4008.96]  would fix
[4008.96 --> 4010.34]  that it
[4010.34 --> 4010.74]  turns out
[4010.74 --> 4011.34]  only Christ
[4011.34 --> 4011.98]  can carry?
[4014.12 --> 4014.48]  Or where
[4014.48 --> 4014.72]  are you
[4014.72 --> 4015.28]  tempted to
[4015.28 --> 4016.10]  measure God's
[4016.10 --> 4016.74]  faithfulness
[4016.74 --> 4017.28]  by how you
[4017.28 --> 4018.44]  feel rather
[4018.44 --> 4019.08]  than by what
[4019.08 --> 4019.72]  he has done?
[4021.16 --> 4021.90]  Take these
[4021.90 --> 4022.66]  questions and
[4022.66 --> 4023.62]  prayerfully
[4023.62 --> 4025.42]  bring them
[4025.42 --> 4026.86]  before the
[4026.86 --> 4027.08]  Lord.
[4028.36 --> 4029.10]  Notice where
[4029.10 --> 4029.82]  you are weary,
[4030.98 --> 4031.66]  notice where you
[4031.66 --> 4032.36]  are resistant,
[4033.14 --> 4033.60]  where you are
[4033.60 --> 4034.48]  hesitant to
[4034.48 --> 4035.40]  press in,
[4035.68 --> 4036.44]  and then take
[4036.44 --> 4037.12]  note of where
[4037.12 --> 4037.92]  there is a
[4037.92 --> 4038.96]  persistent hope
[4038.96 --> 4040.06]  in you.
[4041.66 --> 4042.32]  I'm not going
[4042.32 --> 4042.82]  to give you
[4042.82 --> 4043.92]  answers here,
[4044.24 --> 4044.96]  I simply want
[4044.96 --> 4045.46]  to show you
[4045.46 --> 4045.92]  this door.
[4047.02 --> 4047.70]  How you choose
[4047.70 --> 4048.32]  to walk through
[4048.32 --> 4049.06]  it this next
[4049.06 --> 4050.02]  week is up
[4050.02 --> 4050.34]  to you and
[4050.34 --> 4050.60]  God.
[4051.64 --> 4052.52]  But if you
[4052.52 --> 4053.00]  choose to
[4053.00 --> 4053.46]  walk through
[4053.46 --> 4054.72]  it, I want
[4054.72 --> 4055.00]  to give you
[4055.00 --> 4055.60]  some tools
[4055.60 --> 4056.24]  for how to
[4056.24 --> 4056.78]  sustain it.
[4057.64 --> 4058.42]  The shepherds
[4058.42 --> 4059.10]  return to their
[4059.10 --> 4060.08]  fields and you
[4060.08 --> 4060.68]  too are being
[4060.68 --> 4061.38]  sent back to
[4061.38 --> 4061.84]  your ordinary
[4061.84 --> 4062.86]  life, God
[4062.86 --> 4063.58]  is not asking
[4063.58 --> 4064.20]  you to take
[4064.20 --> 4064.66]  on new
[4064.66 --> 4065.88]  burdens, he's
[4065.88 --> 4066.88]  inviting you to
[4066.88 --> 4067.22]  a new
[4067.22 --> 4068.06]  attentiveness.
[4069.82 --> 4071.56]  So, I'm
[4071.56 --> 4071.84]  going to give
[4071.84 --> 4072.88]  you four
[4072.88 --> 4074.52]  quick ways
[4074.52 --> 4075.18]  you can
[4075.18 --> 4076.02]  return
[4076.02 --> 4076.92]  yourself.
[4078.28 --> 4078.88]  First,
[4079.10 --> 4079.66]  return
[4079.66 --> 4080.94]  prayerfully.
[4082.62 --> 4083.10]  What would
[4083.10 --> 4083.80]  it look like
[4083.80 --> 4084.60]  to pray
[4084.60 --> 4085.24]  through your
[4085.24 --> 4086.24]  work, through
[4086.24 --> 4087.00]  your routines,
[4087.26 --> 4087.62]  through your
[4087.62 --> 4088.74]  responsibilities each
[4088.74 --> 4088.98]  day?
[4090.04 --> 4090.64]  Take a
[4090.64 --> 4091.34]  moment to
[4091.34 --> 4091.90]  name not
[4091.90 --> 4092.56]  only what is
[4092.56 --> 4093.60]  happening but
[4093.60 --> 4094.96]  also what you
[4094.96 --> 4095.88]  are afraid of.
[4096.64 --> 4097.04]  Take a
[4097.04 --> 4097.54]  moment to
[4097.54 --> 4098.14]  pray through
[4098.14 --> 4098.52]  what you
[4098.52 --> 4099.22]  hope for.
[4100.86 --> 4101.42]  Return
[4101.42 --> 4102.48]  attentively.
[4103.88 --> 4104.50]  Ask yourself
[4104.50 --> 4105.00]  in prayer,
[4105.18 --> 4105.66]  where might
[4105.66 --> 4106.16]  God be
[4106.16 --> 4106.78]  present in
[4106.78 --> 4107.24]  the ordinary
[4107.24 --> 4107.88]  moments of
[4107.88 --> 4108.26]  your day?
[4108.94 --> 4109.50]  In your
[4109.50 --> 4110.12]  meals, in
[4110.12 --> 4110.26]  your
[4110.26 --> 4110.82]  conversations,
[4111.10 --> 4111.40]  in your
[4111.40 --> 4112.08]  commutes, in
[4112.08 --> 4112.58]  your quiet
[4112.58 --> 4113.50]  corners of
[4113.50 --> 4114.04]  your home,
[4114.32 --> 4114.86]  and how
[4114.86 --> 4115.86]  could noticing
[4115.86 --> 4117.00]  his presence
[4117.00 --> 4118.58]  reshape the
[4118.58 --> 4119.52]  way you move
[4119.52 --> 4120.08]  through these
[4120.08 --> 4120.50]  routines?
[4121.34 --> 4124.88]  return in
[4124.88 --> 4125.66]  community.
[4126.94 --> 4127.20]  And so
[4127.20 --> 4128.18]  who in
[4128.18 --> 4128.62]  the body
[4128.62 --> 4129.22]  of Christ,
[4129.28 --> 4129.84]  whether this
[4129.84 --> 4130.64]  one here or
[4130.64 --> 4131.26]  one that you
[4131.26 --> 4131.76]  are connected
[4131.76 --> 4132.38]  to outside
[4132.38 --> 4133.10]  of here,
[4133.46 --> 4133.88]  who in
[4133.88 --> 4134.20]  the body
[4134.20 --> 4134.62]  of Christ
[4134.62 --> 4135.48]  might God
[4135.48 --> 4136.04]  be asking
[4136.04 --> 4136.44]  you to
[4136.44 --> 4137.24]  connect with
[4137.24 --> 4137.96]  this week,
[4138.38 --> 4139.58]  even if
[4139.58 --> 4140.06]  your energy
[4140.06 --> 4140.62]  is low,
[4141.82 --> 4142.38]  even if
[4142.38 --> 4143.02]  your enthusiasm
[4143.02 --> 4143.80]  is fleeting?
[4144.64 --> 4145.28]  How can
[4145.28 --> 4145.84]  you share
[4145.84 --> 4146.82]  ordinary life
[4146.82 --> 4147.48]  together so
[4147.48 --> 4147.94]  that faith
[4147.94 --> 4148.68]  and encouragement
[4148.68 --> 4149.96]  are mutual?
[4151.90 --> 4152.30]  Would you
[4152.30 --> 4152.70]  take the
[4152.70 --> 4154.34]  risk of
[4154.34 --> 4154.90]  vulnerability
[4154.90 --> 4156.38]  in this
[4156.38 --> 4157.82]  moment because
[4157.82 --> 4158.14]  of the
[4158.14 --> 4159.90]  security of
[4159.90 --> 4160.24]  who God
[4160.24 --> 4160.50]  is?
[4161.80 --> 4162.38]  And then
[4162.38 --> 4162.78]  lastly,
[4163.02 --> 4164.12]  return with
[4164.12 --> 4165.06]  a new or
[4165.06 --> 4165.72]  renewed
[4165.72 --> 4166.66]  purpose.
[4167.96 --> 4168.26]  And how
[4168.26 --> 4169.00]  does remembering
[4169.00 --> 4169.94]  that God has
[4169.94 --> 4170.36]  kept his
[4170.36 --> 4170.96]  promises in
[4170.96 --> 4171.76]  Christ change
[4171.76 --> 4172.66]  the way you
[4172.66 --> 4173.24]  approach your
[4173.24 --> 4174.26]  ordinary tasks,
[4174.66 --> 4175.46]  your relationships,
[4175.80 --> 4176.50]  or your week
[4176.50 --> 4176.76]  ahead?
[4176.76 --> 4177.58]  And what
[4177.58 --> 4178.44]  is one way
[4178.44 --> 4178.88]  that you
[4178.88 --> 4179.44]  can carry
[4179.44 --> 4180.18]  this renewed
[4180.18 --> 4180.76]  perspective
[4180.76 --> 4181.80]  into your
[4181.80 --> 4182.44]  daily life?
[4185.74 --> 4186.80]  This is not
[4186.80 --> 4187.56]  about keeping
[4187.56 --> 4188.54]  the Christmas
[4188.54 --> 4189.60]  glow alive,
[4190.00 --> 4190.38]  all right?
[4191.76 --> 4192.82]  This is about
[4192.82 --> 4193.84]  trusting that
[4193.84 --> 4194.42]  the incarnation
[4194.42 --> 4195.18]  of Jesus
[4195.18 --> 4196.42]  has already
[4196.42 --> 4197.74]  changed everything.
[4198.88 --> 4200.04]  Your routines,
[4200.78 --> 4201.54]  your ordinary
[4201.54 --> 4202.14]  spaces,
[4202.66 --> 4203.38]  your work,
[4204.00 --> 4204.74]  your relationships,
[4204.74 --> 4204.86]  relationships,
[4205.24 --> 4206.34]  they are now
[4206.34 --> 4207.78]  all imbued
[4207.78 --> 4208.64]  with this
[4208.64 --> 4209.70]  new meaning
[4209.70 --> 4210.70]  because God
[4210.70 --> 4211.34]  has come
[4211.34 --> 4212.48]  near to
[4212.48 --> 4212.78]  you.
[4214.22 --> 4214.72]  And so,
[4214.78 --> 4215.00]  yes,
[4215.06 --> 4215.66]  it's after
[4215.66 --> 4216.12]  Christmas,
[4216.12 --> 4217.28]  it's time
[4217.28 --> 4217.90]  to return
[4217.90 --> 4218.32]  to the
[4218.32 --> 4218.82]  ordinary,
[4219.38 --> 4220.42]  but now
[4220.42 --> 4221.14]  we do
[4221.14 --> 4222.28]  so in
[4222.28 --> 4222.56]  the
[4222.56 --> 4223.36]  extraordinary
[4223.36 --> 4224.70]  reality
[4224.70 --> 4225.54]  defining
[4225.54 --> 4226.90]  truth of
[4226.90 --> 4227.26]  God's
[4227.26 --> 4227.74]  presence
[4227.74 --> 4229.38]  and his
[4229.38 --> 4229.88]  promise.
[4229.88 --> 4232.64]  and that
[4232.64 --> 4233.04]  will change
[4233.04 --> 4233.32]  what your
[4233.32 --> 4233.78]  week looks
[4233.78 --> 4234.08]  like.
[4235.24 --> 4235.96]  Let's pray
[4235.96 --> 4236.32]  together.
[4245.20 --> 4246.00]  Lord Jesus,
[4246.14 --> 4246.62]  we know
[4246.62 --> 4247.10]  that you
[4247.10 --> 4247.72]  are here.
[4250.80 --> 4251.70]  We know
[4251.70 --> 4252.24]  that you
[4252.24 --> 4253.42]  have come
[4253.42 --> 4254.06]  into this
[4254.06 --> 4254.46]  world,
[4255.12 --> 4255.58]  that you
[4255.58 --> 4256.02]  have taken
[4256.02 --> 4256.78]  on flesh,
[4256.78 --> 4258.02]  and we
[4258.02 --> 4258.34]  know
[4258.34 --> 4259.74]  that even
[4259.74 --> 4260.28]  though you
[4260.28 --> 4261.30]  have lived
[4261.30 --> 4262.08]  and died
[4262.08 --> 4262.52]  in our
[4262.52 --> 4262.92]  place,
[4263.02 --> 4263.60]  that even
[4263.60 --> 4264.00]  though you
[4264.00 --> 4264.68]  have ascended
[4264.68 --> 4265.48]  now to the
[4265.48 --> 4266.04]  right hand
[4266.04 --> 4266.36]  of the
[4266.36 --> 4266.64]  Father,
[4266.78 --> 4267.08]  that you
[4267.08 --> 4267.52]  have sent
[4267.52 --> 4268.24]  your Spirit
[4268.24 --> 4269.54]  to be with
[4269.54 --> 4270.16]  us and
[4270.16 --> 4270.62]  to draw
[4270.62 --> 4271.16]  us near
[4271.16 --> 4271.62]  to you.
[4272.60 --> 4272.96]  And we
[4272.96 --> 4273.56]  know that
[4273.56 --> 4274.66]  in worship
[4274.66 --> 4275.58]  our hearts
[4275.58 --> 4276.80]  and imaginations
[4276.80 --> 4278.18]  ascend into
[4278.18 --> 4278.78]  the highest
[4278.78 --> 4279.78]  heavens that
[4279.78 --> 4280.32]  we might be
[4280.32 --> 4280.88]  once again
[4280.88 --> 4281.32]  in your
[4281.32 --> 4282.00]  presence by
[4282.00 --> 4282.50]  the same
[4282.50 --> 4283.12]  work of
[4283.12 --> 4283.74]  that Spirit.
[4285.18 --> 4285.74]  And so
[4285.74 --> 4286.60]  transform
[4286.60 --> 4287.16]  our
[4287.16 --> 4288.96]  imaginations,
[4289.18 --> 4289.58]  transform
[4289.58 --> 4290.36]  the way
[4290.36 --> 4291.30]  we see
[4291.30 --> 4291.94]  the world
[4291.94 --> 4293.02]  right now.
[4297.60 --> 4298.48]  Help us
[4298.48 --> 4298.98]  to know,
[4299.24 --> 4299.64]  Lord God,
[4300.20 --> 4300.74]  that in the
[4300.74 --> 4301.28]  ordinary
[4301.28 --> 4302.54]  movements
[4302.54 --> 4303.52]  of our
[4303.52 --> 4304.12]  lives,
[4304.26 --> 4305.60]  you are
[4305.60 --> 4305.92]  doing
[4305.92 --> 4306.78]  extraordinary
[4306.78 --> 4307.56]  things,
[4308.56 --> 4309.60]  and that
[4309.60 --> 4310.36]  your presence
[4310.36 --> 4311.82]  is with
[4311.82 --> 4312.26]  us.
[4314.70 --> 4315.50]  No matter
[4315.50 --> 4316.18]  how heavy
[4316.18 --> 4317.08]  life may
[4317.08 --> 4317.50]  feel,
[4318.70 --> 4319.64]  may we
[4319.64 --> 4320.10]  rely on
[4320.10 --> 4320.68]  your strength.
[4322.08 --> 4322.76]  No matter
[4322.76 --> 4323.46]  how dark
[4323.46 --> 4324.32]  the moments
[4324.32 --> 4325.16]  may seem,
[4326.38 --> 4326.96]  may we
[4326.96 --> 4327.68]  look to
[4327.68 --> 4328.44]  you for
[4328.44 --> 4328.86]  light.
[4330.54 --> 4331.20]  And no matter
[4331.20 --> 4332.66]  how confused
[4332.66 --> 4333.40]  the world
[4333.40 --> 4334.08]  may seem,
[4335.14 --> 4335.88]  may we
[4335.88 --> 4336.30]  turn to
[4336.30 --> 4337.32]  you for
[4337.32 --> 4337.74]  truth.
[4339.14 --> 4339.82]  Jesus,
[4339.96 --> 4340.56]  we pray this
[4340.64 --> 4341.04]  in your
[4341.04 --> 4341.60]  holy
[4341.60 --> 4342.14]  name.
[4343.28 --> 4343.70]  Amen.
[4345.22 --> 4345.74]  Amen.
[4359.82 --> 4360.68]  Amen.
[4360.68 --> 4372.16]  Take my life and let it be
[4372.16 --> 4378.58]  Consecrated, Lord, to Thee
[4378.58 --> 4385.12]  Take my hand and let them rule
[4385.12 --> 4391.58]  Have the impulse of Thy love
[4391.58 --> 4398.30]  Have the impulse of Thy love
[4398.30 --> 4408.32]  Take my feet and let them be
[4408.32 --> 4414.12]  Swift and beautiful for Thee
[4415.12 --> 4421.58]  Take my voice and let me sing
[4421.58 --> 4428.12]  Always, only for my King
[4428.12 --> 4435.58]  Always, only for my King
[4435.58 --> 4446.04]  Take my silver and my gold
[4446.04 --> 4452.04]  Not of my blood I withhold
[4452.04 --> 4458.50]  Take my moments and my days
[4458.50 --> 4464.50]  Let them flow in ceaseless praise
[4464.50 --> 4470.96]  Let them flow in ceaseless praise
[4470.96 --> 4481.42]  Take my will and make it Thine
[4481.42 --> 4491.88]  Take my will and make it Thine
[4491.88 --> 4502.34]  It shall be no longer mine
[4502.34 --> 4504.34]  Take my heart, it is Thine
[4504.34 --> 4514.80]  It shall be Thy royal throne
[4514.80 --> 4520.80]  It shall be Thy royal throne
[4520.80 --> 4527.26]  It shall be Thy royal throne
[4527.26 --> 4537.72]  Take my will and make it Thine
[4537.72 --> 4550.18]  Take my will and make it Thine
[4550.18 --> 4553.18]  Take my will and make it Thine
[4553.18 --> 4560.18]  It shall be no longer mine
[4560.18 --> 4566.64]  Take my heart, it is Thine
[4566.64 --> 4577.10]  It shall be Thy royal throne
[4577.10 --> 4581.10]  It shall be Thy royal throne
[4581.10 --> 4594.56]  Before you go this week
[4594.56 --> 4596.72]  If you would like to meet someone for prayer
[4596.72 --> 4599.14]  There will be someone up here after the service
[4599.14 --> 4600.66]  who would love to connect with you
[4600.66 --> 4602.06]  and to pray with you
[4602.06 --> 4605.24]  I am also very mindful of the fact
[4605.24 --> 4606.96]  that there are a number of people out there
[4606.96 --> 4608.28]  in your rows beside you
[4608.28 --> 4609.40]  who would also do the same
[4609.40 --> 4612.34]  and so turn to those around you
[4612.34 --> 4614.82]  and see how you might pray for them
[4614.82 --> 4616.74]  as well as we go into this week
[4616.74 --> 4619.38]  Lastly, just a quick reminder
[4619.38 --> 4622.34]  hope to see many of you on New Year's Day
[4622.34 --> 4625.96]  at 12.30 for our skating together
[4625.96 --> 4631.00]  Go then with the blessing of our God
[4631.00 --> 4635.48]  God, go before you to lead you
[4635.48 --> 4638.22]  God, go behind you to protect you
[4638.22 --> 4640.68]  God, go beneath you to support you
[4640.68 --> 4643.56]  and God, go beside you to befriend you
[4643.56 --> 4646.18]  Do not be afraid
[4646.18 --> 4648.74]  Let the blessing of God come upon you today
[4648.74 --> 4650.44]  Do not be afraid
[4650.44 --> 4655.30]  but go in peace to love and serve the Lord
[4655.30 --> 4656.74]  Amen
[4661.00 --> 4668.76]  Set your rule and reign in our hearts again
[4668.76 --> 4672.88]  In peace in us we pray
[4672.88 --> 4676.96]  Avail why we're made
[4676.96 --> 4681.42]  Come set our hearts ablaze with hope
[4681.42 --> 4685.52]  Like a cloud file in our very souls
[4685.52 --> 4692.00]  Holy Spirit come invade us now
[4692.00 --> 4697.10]  We are your church
[4697.10 --> 4703.90]  We need your power in us
[4703.90 --> 4712.72]  We need your kingdom first
[4712.72 --> 4716.68]  We hunger and we thirst
[4716.68 --> 4720.72]  Refuse to waste our lives
[4720.72 --> 4724.66]  For you're our joy and prize
[4724.66 --> 4728.86]  To see the captive hearts released
[4728.86 --> 4732.84]  The hurt, the sick, the poor and meek
[4732.84 --> 4739.34]  We lay down our lives for heaven's souls
[4739.34 --> 4744.38]  We are your church
[4744.38 --> 4750.86]  We pray revive this earth
[4750.86 --> 4756.80]  We are your kingdom first
[4756.80 --> 4758.68]  We are your kingdom first
[4758.68 --> 4759.26]  We are your kingdom first
[4759.26 --> 4763.12]  Let the darkness fear
[4763.12 --> 4767.06]  Show your mighty hand
[4767.06 --> 4770.96]  Fill our streets at last
[4770.96 --> 4774.70]  Set your church on fire
[4774.70 --> 4778.44]  With the station back
[4778.44 --> 4780.44]  Change the atmosphere
[4780.44 --> 4781.44]  Change the atmosphere
[4781.44 --> 4782.44]  Change the atmosphere
[4782.44 --> 4784.44]  Build your kingdom
[4784.44 --> 4785.44]  We are we pray
[4785.44 --> 4786.44]  Build your kingdom
[4786.44 --> 4788.44]  We are we pray
[4788.44 --> 4798.44]  Unleash your kingdom's power
[4798.44 --> 4801.44]  Reach in the near and far
[4801.44 --> 4805.44]  No more smell can song
[4805.44 --> 4809.44]  Your beauty changing heart
[4809.44 --> 4814.44]  You've made us for much more than this
[4814.44 --> 4817.44]  Awake the kingdom seed in us
[4817.44 --> 4820.44]  Fill with earth the strength
[4820.44 --> 4824.44]  And love of Christ
[4824.44 --> 4828.44]  We are your church
[4828.44 --> 4835.44]  We are the home on earth
[4835.44 --> 4837.44]  We are the home on earth
[4837.44 --> 4843.44]  Build your kingdom here
[4843.44 --> 4847.44]  Let the darkness fear
[4847.44 --> 4849.44]  Show your mighty hand
[4849.44 --> 4851.44]  Fill our streets and lands
[4851.44 --> 4852.44]  Send your church on fire
[4852.44 --> 4853.44]  Fill our streets and lands
[4853.44 --> 4855.44]  Fill our streets and lands
[4855.44 --> 4856.44]  Fill our streets and lands
[4856.44 --> 4858.44]  Send your church on fire
[4858.44 --> 4859.44]  Send your church on fire
[4859.44 --> 4860.44]  With the station back
[4860.44 --> 4862.44]  With the station back

[4866.44 --> 4868.44]  Build your kingdom
[4868.44 --> 4870.44]  Fill your kingdom
[4870.44 --> 4875.44]  We are we pray
[4875.44 --> 4905.42]  Thank you.

[4935.44 --> 4965.42]  Thank you.
[4965.44 --> 4995.42]  Thank you.
