[0.00 → 13.64] Out of the shadows, found for the gallows, a dead man walking, till love came calling.
[14.72 → 19.40] Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up.
[19.52 → 27.90] Six feet under, I thought it was over, and answered a prayer, the voice of a saviour.
[27.90 → 34.00] Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up.
[34.48 → 49.90] Fall in once, I came alive, this beating on, these open eyes, the ground let go, the darkness should have known.
[49.90 → 58.90] Oh, you're still rolling, you're still rolling, you're still rolling, you're still rolling, you're still rolling, you're still rolling.
[62.90 → 69.12] Now that you saved me, I think cause you gave me a song of revival.
[69.12 → 71.64] I put it on vinyl
[71.64 → 73.98] Rise up
[73.98 → 76.38] Rise up
[76.38 → 77.50] Rise up
[77.50 → 79.50] I once was blinded
[79.50 → 81.90] But now I see it
[81.90 → 83.80] I heard about the power
[83.80 → 86.88] And now I believe it
[86.88 → 88.52] Rise up
[88.52 → 89.64] Rise up
[89.64 → 92.14] Rise up
[92.14 → 94.48] All at once
[94.48 → 96.82] I came alive
[96.82 → 99.34] This bitter night
[99.34 → 101.72] These open eyes
[101.72 → 104.08] They're going to go
[104.08 → 109.86] The darkness should have known
[109.86 → 112.88] You're still Rolling Stones
[112.88 → 117.80] You're still Rolling Stones
[117.80 → 125.48] I thought that I was too far gone
[125.48 → 130.84] For everything I've done wrong
[130.84 → 135.48] Yeah, I'm the one who dug this grave
[135.48 → 138.70] But you called my name
[138.70 → 141.60] You called my name
[141.60 → 145.54] I thought that I was too far gone
[145.54 → 150.88] For everything I've done wrong
[150.88 → 155.68] Yeah, I'm the one who dug this grave
[155.68 → 158.72] But you called my name
[158.72 → 162.76] You called my name
[162.76 → 166.22] All at once
[166.22 → 167.76] I came alive
[167.76 → 170.98] This bitter night
[170.98 → 172.76] These open eyes
[172.76 → 175.80] They're going to go
[175.80 → 180.76] The darkness should have known
[180.76 → 183.76] You're still rolling stone
[183.76 → 185.54] He's still rolling
[185.54 → 201.08] Oh, you're still rolling
[201.08 → 206.02] Rolling
[206.02 → 206.80] Rolling
[206.80 → 207.74] You're still rolling
[207.74 → 208.32] Strong
[208.32 → 238.30] Sitsang with Moon
[238.32 → 263.56] Test one, two, test, check, test, test, test, hello, everybody.
[263.56 → 269.24] Test one, two, testing, testing, are we live, are we live?
[269.46 → 270.96] Seems to be bouncing up there, so.
[293.56 → 300.32] The angels went, the Father looked away.
[303.20 → 309.92] The final breath, He bowed His hand.
[310.56 → 313.56] The Lamb of God was slain.
[313.56 → 319.68] By His wounds I am set free
[319.68 → 326.56] By His blood I've been redeemed
[326.56 → 332.56] The great divide He crossed for me
[332.56 → 338.88] Oh, praise the God of Calvary
[338.88 → 355.20] On the hill of Calvary
[355.20 → 359.30] Into the Father's hands
[359.30 → 363.66] A holy surrender
[363.66 → 368.26] A borrowed tomb
[368.26 → 371.56] His mother wept
[371.56 → 374.98] And there His body lay
[374.98 → 381.20] But the stone was moved
[381.20 → 384.54] He conquered death
[384.54 → 386.12] And rose
[398.26 → 413.56] Christ is risen
[413.56 → 425.50] Christ is risen
[425.50 → 428.90] Christ is risen
[428.90 → 433.86] Christ is risen
[433.86 → 438.94] Amen and amen
[438.94 → 442.74] Welcome to worship on this Resurrection Sunday
[442.74 → 445.70] A special welcome if you are a guest among us
[445.70 → 448.28] My name is Chris, I'm one of the pastors here
[448.28 → 454.62] And it's our privilege to gather together and to worship our risen Saviour today
[454.62 → 460.78] Before we begin in earnest we have a couple announcements to remind you of and throw it in front of you
[460.78 → 467.58] First, in May, beginning in May, we will be running a pastor's class
[467.58 → 476.56] And so that's a class for people, primarily young people, often who have found their way through our youth program
[476.56 → 479.24] And who are interested in doing profession of faith
[479.24 → 483.02] Interested in standing up and saying, yes, this I believe
[483.02 → 486.20] And I want to share that with this family of God
[486.20 → 489.94] And so if you are interested in making a public profession of faith
[489.94 → 492.56] Talk to me or to Pastor Kevin
[492.56 → 494.46] After our worship together
[494.46 → 497.28] And we'll explain to you what pastor's class looks like
[497.28 → 499.94] And when that will get started in earnest
[499.94 → 507.48] Secondly, we want to remind you or inform you that next Sunday here at Emmanuel is Gems Sunday
[507.48 → 510.68] And so we're going to be celebrating and lifting the Gems ministry
[510.68 → 514.52] It's a young girls ministry that happens here every other week
[514.52 → 520.32] We'll hear stories from them, see what God has been up to in the midst of that work together
[520.32 → 526.76] And then lastly, April is the month when we also celebrate and practice treat tag
[526.76 → 535.52] I'll give you another chance at the end of the announcement, be ready
[535.52 → 540.22] And so if you don't know, treat tag
[540.22 → 541.56] Treat tag
[541.56 → 545.36] Is one of the things we do around here where we just bless one another
[545.36 → 548.94] By sharing a small treat, a goodie of some sort
[548.94 → 553.00] Either here at church on our Sunday worship
[553.00 → 555.60] Or throughout the week dropping it on people's porches
[555.60 → 558.28] Or sneaking it to them in some way
[558.28 → 560.52] I encourage you to continue that
[560.52 → 563.16] And keep that going through the end of the month
[563.16 → 566.14] As we have the opportunity to do so
[566.14 → 567.08] Treat tag
[567.08 → 571.44] We're losing vigour
[571.44 → 577.84] As we come together, we do so in the presence of our good God
[577.84 → 580.48] And, so I'm going to invite you as you're able to stand together
[580.48 → 584.74] God will welcome us in his presence with his greeting
[584.74 → 589.20] Following the greeting of God, I invite you to turn to those around you
[589.20 → 591.72] And welcome them in worship together
[591.72 → 595.28] Welcome them by passing the peace, saying the peace of Christ be with you
[595.28 → 596.66] Or the Lord be with you
[596.66 → 601.42] Welcome them into our worship this amazing Resurrection Sunday
[601.42 → 603.86] Receive the blessing of our God
[603.86 → 608.22] Grace, mercy, and peace to you
[608.22 → 609.38] From God our Father
[609.38 → 612.42] From the risen Jesus Christ, his Son and our Saviour
[612.42 → 615.26] Through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit
[615.26 → 616.50] Amen
[616.50 → 616.58] Amen
[616.58 → 618.58] Amen

[654.58 → 656.24] Luke 24
[656.24 → 660.20] They found the stone rolled away from the tomb
[660.20 → 663.84] But when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord
[663.84 → 664.42] Jesus
[664.42 → 670.68] While they were wondering about this, suddenly men in clothes that gleamed like lightning
[670.68 → 672.32] stood beside them
[672.32 → 677.48] In their fright, the women bowed down with their faces to the ground
[677.48 → 682.16] But the men said to them, why do you look for the living among the dead?
[682.64 → 688.54] He is not here. He has risen. Remember how he told you
[688.54 → 690.60] While he was still in Galilee
[690.60 → 695.40] That the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men
[695.40 → 696.82] And be crucified
[696.82 → 699.48] And on the third day, rise
[699.48 → 704.14] Let's open our Easter morning worship together
[704.14 → 705.38] In a word of prayer
[705.38 → 712.88] Almighty God, on this Easter Sunday, we celebrate with joy and thankfulness
[712.88 → 715.60] For the sacrificial love of Jesus
[715.60 → 719.36] And the redemption that we have in his death and resurrection
[719.36 → 722.84] Thank you for the gift of salvation
[722.84 → 726.08] And the promise of eternal life with you
[726.08 → 729.74] As we enter into this time of worship
[729.74 → 733.98] May our hearts overflow with gratitude and praise
[733.98 → 735.12] Amen
[735.12 → 739.06] Some of you brought flowers this morning
[739.06 → 742.64] And some of you got a few flowers on your way in
[742.64 → 746.88] So we encourage you in these first two songs of worship this morning
[746.88 → 749.12] To come and pick a vase and put them in there
[749.12 → 770.44] Christ the Lord is risen today

[886.44 → 887.44] He is not dead
[887.44 → 888.44] He is alive
[888.44 → 890.44] He is alive
[890.44 → 892.44] He has this hope

[901.44 → 903.44] He has this hope
[903.44 → 905.44] In Jesus Christ
[905.44 → 919.44] us

[1181.90 → 1183.90] Amen.
[1211.90 → 1219.94] Let's join together with our hearts and our voices in confessing what we believe through
[1219.94 → 1221.16] the Apostles' Creed.
[1223.24 → 1232.00] I believe in God the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and Jesus Christ, His
[1232.00 → 1240.56] only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary, suffered
[1240.56 → 1247.74] under Pontius Pilate, who was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended into heaven.
[1248.26 → 1255.08] The third day He rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven and stood at the right
[1255.08 → 1261.78] hand of God the Father Almighty. From there He shall come to judge the living and the dead.
[1262.60 → 1270.30] I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness
[1270.30 → 1276.64] of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.
[1276.64 → 1276.72] Amen.

[1352.18 → 1364.42] bowing to the Father's will, he took the crown of thorns.
[1364.42 → 1377.36] O that broken cross, my salvation, where your love poured out over me,
[1377.36 → 1389.98] now my soul cries out, Alleluia, praise and honour unto thee.
[1394.42 → 1404.82] Sent of heaven, God's own Son, to purchase and redeem,

[1757.38 → 1760.08] Worthy of all our praises.
[1761.38 → 1767.42] Hosanna, Hosanna.
[1767.42 → 1770.42] Hosanna, Hosanna.
[1770.42 → 1774.86] We welcome you here, Lord Jesus.
[1776.12 → 1782.18] Hosanna, Hosanna.
[1782.18 → 1786.48] You are the God who saves us.
[1787.02 → 1789.70] Worthy of all our praises.
[1789.70 → 1794.82] Hosanna, Hosanna.
[1794.82 → 1796.84] Hosanna, Hosanna.
[1798.10 → 1801.26] Come have your way among us.
[1801.26 → 1804.60] You welcome you here, Lord Jesus.
[1819.70 → 1829.24] Good morning. Blessed Easter to all of you.
[1830.74 → 1837.44] We continue worship by giving our offerings, a thank offering for what God has done for us.
[1838.18 → 1842.56] Today's offering is for the budget, which is the ministries of this church.
[1842.56 → 1846.68] If you wish to give to that, then kindly designate it as such.
[1846.68 → 1850.66] You can use the envelopes that are in the pockets of the chairs in front of you.
[1851.54 → 1857.70] And our other offering in the undesignated monies then will be today for Life Water Canada.
[1858.68 → 1866.80] Life Water Canada was an organization that was dear to our former pastor, Pastor Bill Vestige.
[1866.80 → 1875.56] And some of you might recall that he actually invented a gizmo using old telephone receivers to detect money.
[1875.56 → 1876.68] Sorry, money.
[1877.06 → 1881.56] To detect water in wells.
[1882.46 → 1889.18] Life Water Canada was founded in 1987 by two men from Thunder Bay, Ontario.
[1889.80 → 1894.50] One was a hydrologist, and he was actually challenged to work out his faith.
[1894.50 → 1896.12] And so what does he know best?
[1896.12 → 1897.12] He knows water best.
[1897.12 → 1908.36] So he headed off to Liberia where many wells were contaminated because of civil war and started digging wells there and founded Life Water Canada with another fellow from Thunder Bay.
[1908.36 → 1916.36] And now the projects have extended into Libya, into Kenya, and also into Haiti.
[1916.36 → 1923.86] And when wells are dug in those villages in those countries, it's life-changing for those villages.
[1923.86 → 1927.24] The infant mortality rate goes down.
[1927.60 → 1929.50] Kids aren't walking around with tummy aches anymore.
[1930.00 → 1933.16] And the girls' time now is freed up so that they can go to school.
[1934.22 → 1936.06] So each well costs about $5,000.
[1937.22 → 1939.30] And so, yeah.
[1940.52 → 1944.26] Scripture, we hear that when Jesus was on earth, he said,
[1944.68 → 1946.82] I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink.
[1946.82 → 1950.98] So today, let's be the hands and feet of Jesus and give generously.
[1950.98 → 1974.44] I know he rescued my soul.
[1974.44 → 1978.84] His blood has covered my sin, I believe.
[1978.84 → 1981.84] I believe.
[1981.84 → 1982.40] I believe.
[1985.40 → 1988.44] My shame is taken away.
[1989.44 → 1992.08] My pain is healing his name.
[1992.16 → 1993.28] I believe.
[1995.56 → 1996.84] I believe.
[2000.10 → 2002.36] I'll raise a banner.
[2004.08 → 2006.86] My Lord has come to the grave.
[2006.86 → 2008.48] My Redeemer.
[2008.84 → 2009.94] My Redeemer is.
[2009.94 → 2010.96] My Redeemer is.
[2010.96 → 2013.90] My Redeemer is.
[2013.90 → 2016.90] My Redeemer is.
[2016.90 → 2017.24] My Redeemer is.
[2017.24 → 2022.28] My Redeemer is.
[2023.60 → 2029.06] I know he rescued my soul.
[2029.62 → 2032.92] His blood has covered my sin, I believe.
[2032.92 → 2034.30] I know he dongs a Ramadan.
[2034.30 → 2034.86] My fatigue is, I believe.
[2034.86 → 2036.30] My государ is.
[2036.30 → 2037.26] I understand is that!
[2037.26 → 2037.54] My name is not her name.
[2037.54 → 2039.20] My sin is this day, this day—R968.
[2039.26 → 2039.84] I know he protected my sin.
[2040.88 → 2041.06] I know he brings us.
[2041.06 → 2041.18] My Breeder would tail chis, O society of co-лушerry.
[2041.18 → 2049.16] This is all you want tonight
[2049.16 → 2051.16] I believe
[2051.16 → 2056.84] I'll raise a banner
[2056.84 → 2061.34] My Lord has conquered the grave
[2061.34 → 2064.58] My Redeemer is
[2064.58 → 2068.24] My Redeemer is
[2068.24 → 2071.84] My Redeemer is
[2071.84 → 2076.16] My Redeemer is
[2076.16 → 2080.90] You lift my burdens
[2080.90 → 2084.30] I'll rise in You
[2084.30 → 2088.62] I'm dancing on this fountain top
[2088.62 → 2092.26] To see Your kingdom come
[2092.26 → 2097.28] My Redeemer is
[2097.28 → 2100.80] My Redeemer is
[2100.80 → 2104.38] My Redeemer is
[2104.38 → 2111.32] My Redeemer is
[2111.32 → 2114.70] My Redeemer is
[2114.70 → 2118.60] My Redeemer is
[2118.60 → 2123.78] My Redeemer is
[2123.78 → 2144.54] Good morning, everybody.
[2144.54 → 2150.18] Can I have the kids from preschool all the way up to grade four?
[2153.78 → 2162.78] Can anybody tell me what special day it is?
[2162.78 → 2165.78] Sunday, but what else?
[2165.78 → 2166.78] Easter.
[2166.78 → 2170.78] How do you guys celebrate Easter in your families?
[2170.78 → 2172.78] Easter eggs.
[2172.78 → 2174.78] How else do you celebrate?
[2174.78 → 2181.78] Yep, we celebrate Jesus raising from the dead.
[2181.78 → 2182.78] Yep.
[2182.78 → 2184.78] Sometimes Easter bunny comes.
[2184.78 → 2185.78] Sometimes Easter bunny comes, yep.
[2185.78 → 2191.78] But today we are talking about Jesus raising from the dead and taking all our sins away
[2191.78 → 2195.78] and how excited we are to share it with other people.
[2195.78 → 2200.78] So today in Chillers Worship Time, we're going to go back, and we're going to do some activities
[2200.78 → 2209.78] that we are going to learn a fun way to share Jesus' story and his hope that he gives us to others.
[2209.78 → 2213.78] Can everybody stand up?
[2213.78 → 2216.78] Yeah, I'll get your question and then, okay?
[2216.78 → 2220.78] And today is Easter Sunday.
[2220.78 → 2222.78] Yeah, it's Easter Sunday.
[2222.78 → 2225.78] Okay, everybody look at the congregation.
[2225.78 → 2226.78] One, two, three.
[2226.78 → 2227.78] The Lord.
[2227.78 → 2228.78] Be with you.
[2228.78 → 2230.78] And also with you.
[2231.78 → 2232.78] Steelers W spreadsheet hair heaven switch over,
[2232.78 → 2242.74] don't связь with you is to get the anchor
[2242.78 → 2246.78] of his, tourer his, to terms of earth Richards.
[2246.78 → 2264.00] Good morning, I'm Eric here, an elder at Emmanuel.
[2264.52 → 2268.98] Today I just wanted to bring one prayer note before we come and join each other in our family prayer.
[2269.96 → 2274.02] Tuesday is the last day of our nomination for pastoral elders and deacons in the office.
[2274.02 → 2277.22] There are forms in the e-bulletins by the church office.
[2277.74 → 2284.64] Please prayerfully consider who God has in mind for calling to serve our church family in this way.
[2287.34 → 2288.96] I want a word of prayer this morning.
[2290.64 → 2292.94] This is the day in which the Lord has made.
[2293.22 → 2295.46] We will rejoice and be glad in it.
[2295.74 → 2303.74] May the glory of Jesus' resurrection remind us that with you nothing is impossible or without hope.
[2304.78 → 2307.50] At this time of year, so many of us struggle in silence.
[2308.24 → 2312.80] We struggle with all sorts of health issues, whether physical or mental illness.
[2313.38 → 2318.68] We pray that you, God, will surround us with your peace, comfort, and healing.
[2318.68 → 2326.88] This morning we want to pray for Mina Vein, mother to Joanne Miles, great-grandmother to Megan.
[2327.76 → 2333.58] She finds herself struggling with health issues and that she wants to go to eternal home.
[2334.16 → 2339.36] We pray that she may have a peaceful passing into glory soon.
[2339.36 → 2347.02] Today, we praise you for successful surgery on Matt Sharp as he had knee constructive surgery.
[2347.34 → 2351.32] Comfort him in his healing process that everything will go back to normal soon.
[2351.32 → 2360.00] We also want to think of Emily Lingering as she as well went through knee surgery and that the healing process is working there as well, Lord.
[2360.78 → 2366.60] Lord, we want to pray this morning for the students as many of them are in their home stretch,
[2366.72 → 2371.76] in particular the university and college students as they write their final exams and finish their final projects.
[2372.14 → 2376.56] Comfort, calm their nerves and protect them in their travels.
[2376.56 → 2380.82] Today, we pray for council nomination process.
[2381.22 → 2384.74] We pray that the Holy Spirit will guide and inspire those being nominated,
[2385.20 → 2390.14] lead them to step into the roles in their hearts and serve and love.
[2390.84 → 2395.98] Lord, today we celebrate with the Lingerings as Austin Nichols Sills,
[2396.40 → 2401.82] number 13th grandchild, was given this week to Liz and Gary.
[2403.08 → 2405.80] Lord, we thank you for so many different blessings in this church.
[2406.56 → 2410.78] Lord, we give thanks to you for he is good, his love endures forever.
[2411.40 → 2411.68] Amen.
[2411.68 → 2411.80] Amen.
[2411.80 → 2439.52] We're going to spend some time together in God's word, looking at the story of the resurrection as it's told to us in the Gospel of Luke.
[2439.52 → 2446.44] So we're going to read from Luke 24, the first 12 verses of that chapter.
[2447.06 → 2451.16] I invite you to open that up in a Bible, in your hands or on your devices.
[2451.36 → 2454.32] There's a couple at the back if you'd like to grab one to read along there.
[2456.10 → 2459.52] The first time we go through it will be on the screen behind me.
[2459.52 → 2466.06] From Luke 24.
[2466.06 → 2474.90] On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb.
[2475.72 → 2482.10] They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
[2482.10 → 2490.46] While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them.
[2491.26 → 2495.46] In their fright, the women bowed down with their faces to the ground.
[2495.80 → 2497.06] But the men said to them,
[2497.06 → 2517.68] Then they remembered his words.
[2517.68 → 2544.42] Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb.
[2544.42 → 2554.88] This is the word of the Lord.
[2560.42 → 2566.20] Now, I'll start with a trigger warning for some of you.
[2566.20 → 2568.82] I'm going to talk about the election.
[2571.60 → 2573.96] I don't know if you know, but we're in an election season.
[2575.50 → 2582.22] Part of what that means is that you have the different political parties talking about their platforms
[2582.22 → 2585.38] and what they think will be good for our country going forward.
[2585.46 → 2588.62] Now, I am not going to weigh in one way or the other on that.
[2589.26 → 2591.58] If you want my personal opinion, we can talk after church.
[2591.58 → 2599.60] But this week, parties have released or are about to release their costed platforms.
[2600.64 → 2604.58] Part of that discussion includes looking at our national debt.
[2605.92 → 2608.42] I don't know if any of you have ever thought about our national debt,
[2608.90 → 2612.66] but currently Canada sits in debt at about $3 trillion.
[2615.30 → 2616.68] Now, why do I bring this up?
[2616.68 → 2620.10] Because honestly, that number means nothing to me.
[2621.04 → 2622.90] Like, that's a nonsense number.
[2623.72 → 2627.96] I cannot begin to wrap my head around the quantity, the amount.
[2628.34 → 2630.72] It's functionally meaningless.
[2632.12 → 2635.10] And so when everyone talks about how important it is, candidly,
[2635.64 → 2637.34] like, I just don't get it.
[2637.42 → 2640.98] Because that number doesn't make sense to me.
[2640.98 → 2646.82] Now, the reason I bring this up, because I think it's a modern analog
[2646.82 → 2654.40] to how the disciples and the people around him felt and first experienced the resurrection.
[2655.32 → 2656.90] It doesn't make sense.
[2657.36 → 2659.20] It's a nonsense reality.
[2661.50 → 2663.24] And that's what I want us to look at this morning.
[2664.22 → 2669.16] My theme for today comes from verse 11 of the text we read,
[2669.16 → 2670.46] where we read,
[2670.62 → 2676.38] they did not believe the women because their words seemed to them like nonsense.
[2679.46 → 2687.88] What does it mean to have resurrection faith in an age of nonsense?
[2689.36 → 2693.92] Or to have faith in nonsense when nonsense seems to be the norm?
[2693.92 → 2699.76] Now, here's the thing before we start.
[2700.74 → 2703.72] We say this, or a version of this, all the time.
[2704.22 → 2706.88] If you listen to the Narthex podcast,
[2707.04 → 2710.14] Josh has made this refrain famous.
[2710.66 → 2713.96] The truth is, the Bible was not written to you.
[2714.12 → 2715.86] It was written for you.
[2717.16 → 2720.52] And part of what that means is that the world and the culture of the Bible
[2720.52 → 2724.94] are different from our own, and that is important to recognize
[2724.94 → 2727.28] if you're going to read the Bible correctly.
[2728.90 → 2729.12] Right?
[2730.08 → 2733.90] There's a wrong way to read the Bible.
[2733.90 → 2744.38] And sometimes we come at stories like this from the perspective of,
[2744.86 → 2747.70] well, you know, now we know better.
[2748.64 → 2751.24] Now we understand the world better.
[2752.24 → 2752.46] Right?
[2752.50 → 2757.36] Now we've understood that how things like this happen naturally.
[2757.36 → 2764.92] There's a sort of, like, prideful privileging of the contemporary perspective
[2764.92 → 2769.14] that kind of assumes that people were, back then,
[2769.34 → 2774.48] perhaps not less intelligent, but they knew less about the world.
[2775.56 → 2778.68] And therefore, because they knew less, there were more gaps,
[2778.86 → 2780.36] and they had to believe more.
[2781.22 → 2784.74] They made sense of the world through myths and gods
[2784.74 → 2786.30] and things like the spiritual.
[2786.92 → 2790.78] And while those things still sort of exist in some way,
[2791.10 → 2794.52] what we know is that we make better sense of the world now.
[2795.62 → 2796.12] Right?
[2796.16 → 2799.10] We have better means or other means.
[2799.96 → 2804.06] Now, I don't have time to parse all of that out this morning,
[2804.46 → 2807.60] but I do want us to notice something about the resurrection.
[2808.04 → 2808.18] Okay?
[2809.24 → 2813.00] The resurrection didn't make sense to the disciples.
[2813.00 → 2813.40] Right?
[2814.66 → 2818.24] Their words seemed to them like nonsense.
[2819.50 → 2822.28] And so even though sometimes we look at the Bible, and we think,
[2822.36 → 2824.92] oh, we know better today, and we think differently now,
[2825.06 → 2826.86] I don't want you to come at this story,
[2826.94 → 2829.82] the story of the resurrection, from that place.
[2829.84 → 2833.38] Because resurrection doesn't make sense in the ancient world either.
[2835.06 → 2835.54] Right?
[2835.56 → 2839.34] It doesn't make any more sense than as it does now.
[2840.22 → 2840.70] Right?
[2840.70 → 2844.72] Resurrection was just as nonsense sounding then as it was today.
[2845.84 → 2846.76] And here's the point.
[2847.46 → 2848.70] An interesting point in this.
[2849.04 → 2852.68] The word that Luke uses that means nonsense,
[2852.90 → 2854.46] it's the Greek word zeros,
[2854.90 → 2857.44] it's only used here in the Bible.
[2858.58 → 2861.00] But it's actually an old Greek word,
[2861.14 → 2862.16] an Attic Greek word,
[2862.26 → 2864.70] so predating the Greek that was used during this time.
[2864.70 → 2870.22] And it's a word that shows up in what's called the Hippocratic Corpus.
[2870.76 → 2875.00] Now, the Hippocratic Corpus is like the WebMD of the ancient world.
[2876.28 → 2876.90] Right?
[2876.94 → 2881.48] It's a collection of medical writings from the school of Hippocrates.
[2882.16 → 2884.96] Maybe you've heard of the phrase the Hippocratic Oath.
[2885.34 → 2885.52] Right?
[2885.62 → 2886.34] Do no harm.
[2886.34 → 2891.88] So Hippocrates was a 4th century BC physician and philosopher.
[2892.24 → 2896.76] And his school around him collected all of these medical documents
[2896.76 → 2899.96] and writings about health and well-being.
[2900.74 → 2905.24] And in the collection of writings associated with Hippocrates,
[2905.24 → 2910.16] the word zeros is used to describe irrational speech,
[2910.66 → 2912.74] hallucinations, and delirium
[2912.74 → 2916.50] that's associated with illness or really high fevers.
[2917.52 → 2919.20] You have ever seen someone with a really high fever
[2919.20 → 2920.68] and they start to say nonsense?
[2920.98 → 2922.42] That's how this word is used.
[2923.84 → 2927.58] Point is, the disciples are more likely to believe
[2927.58 → 2930.54] the women are delirious, are hallucinating,
[2931.04 → 2932.54] than that Jesus was raised.
[2932.54 → 2937.86] That's not really that different from today.
[2939.56 → 2941.64] So to be clear and sure, right,
[2941.72 → 2944.36] that the resurrection doesn't make sense.
[2944.80 → 2947.26] Not because it's irrational,
[2947.86 → 2951.60] but because it doesn't fit into the existing framework
[2951.60 → 2954.78] of perception and expectation and meaning.
[2957.82 → 2962.34] That is the world and work of sense-making.
[2963.16 → 2965.64] Perception, expectation, and meaning
[2965.64 → 2969.04] is the area of focus and thought
[2969.04 → 2971.98] where we make sense of the world.
[2972.78 → 2974.74] I want to play with that word a little bit this morning.
[2975.82 → 2981.10] The word sense has kind of two meanings with us, right?
[2981.10 → 2986.00] We use the word sense in reference to our physical perception.
[2986.00 → 2991.32] What do we call sight, touch, taste, smell, and hearing?
[2991.50 → 2994.46] Our five senses, exactly.
[2995.72 → 3000.74] But sense also has always included comprehension
[3000.74 → 3003.34] or even emotional aspects.
[3004.42 → 3008.78] Think about when a math problem clicks for the very first time.
[3009.72 → 3010.72] You go, that makes sense.
[3010.72 → 3011.36] Right?
[3012.30 → 3012.92] It adds up.
[3013.28 → 3014.10] It lines up.
[3014.26 → 3018.70] Or think about when you empathize with someone after a loss, right?
[3018.72 → 3020.40] And they're explaining their hurt, and you say,
[3020.74 → 3022.34] yeah, that makes sense.
[3023.94 → 3024.42] Right?
[3024.44 → 3027.10] It's not that you can touch, taste, see, or smell
[3027.10 → 3028.82] what it is that they're feeling,
[3029.38 → 3030.14] but it fits.
[3030.56 → 3033.36] It accords with what we know to be true.
[3033.36 → 3040.00] And so nonsense, right, is the thing or the lack of a thing
[3040.00 → 3042.82] with a lack of meaning or a lack of coherence
[3042.82 → 3046.90] or a lack of a correspondence to reality as we understand it.
[3047.68 → 3049.58] And again, in the world of the disciples
[3049.58 → 3051.10] and in the world of today,
[3051.36 → 3054.86] we can see how the resurrection doesn't make sense
[3054.86 → 3056.58] because it doesn't cohere,
[3056.84 → 3061.50] it doesn't line up with what we ordinarily experience as reality.
[3061.50 → 3063.42] We can't make sense of it.
[3065.06 → 3066.38] But here's the thing.
[3069.82 → 3072.06] As we talk about sense-making,
[3073.58 → 3078.66] people in our day and age
[3078.66 → 3085.28] have lost the sense to make sense of the world.
[3086.44 → 3087.40] Now, here's what I mean, right?
[3087.40 → 3089.94] And you can experience this all over social media,
[3090.16 → 3091.84] in Discord servers, on YouTube,
[3092.34 → 3094.58] in your coffee shops, and around.
[3094.72 → 3097.90] People are trying to make sense of the world.
[3098.88 → 3098.96] Right?
[3099.10 → 3102.18] Sense-making and sense and meaning-making
[3102.18 → 3103.30] are two terms,
[3103.70 → 3106.52] for those of you who are interested in this sort of thing,
[3106.84 → 3109.40] two terms that have skyrocketed
[3109.94 → 3112.58] in their use in SEO key terms.
[3112.90 → 3115.60] For those of you who know internet sleuthing,
[3115.60 → 3119.36] SEO key terms are things that you put sort of behind the main page.
[3119.44 → 3122.02] You write it into the code of your website
[3122.02 → 3123.80] so that when people are searching terms,
[3123.94 → 3125.10] yours comes up on top.
[3125.66 → 3127.38] Sense-making and meaning-making are terms
[3127.38 → 3130.42] that have been coded into SEO algorithms
[3130.42 → 3133.12] in order to drive traffic to these conversations
[3133.12 → 3134.98] because this is what people are talking about.
[3136.56 → 3138.54] Now, this idea of sense-making,
[3139.02 → 3141.18] I've been doing a bit of a deep dive into this,
[3141.18 → 3146.04] originally comes in the 60s in organizational psychology,
[3146.04 → 3150.44] and it's come to mean something of the development
[3150.44 → 3154.30] of plausible images and structures and stories
[3154.30 → 3157.06] to explain, to make sense of,
[3157.56 → 3161.76] what people do and how we exist in the world.
[3161.76 → 3167.30] Now, I trust that many of you have experienced
[3167.30 → 3172.42] that over the last 50, 30, and 10 years,
[3172.82 → 3177.14] we've seen a shift in how people make sense of the world.
[3178.48 → 3179.60] In the past,
[3179.78 → 3182.08] and some of us still see the world this way,
[3182.94 → 3184.18] but in the past,
[3184.30 → 3186.76] making sense of the world required measurements,
[3187.60 → 3189.82] it required reason and observation,
[3189.82 → 3191.20] and nothing else.
[3191.88 → 3195.08] What is real is what can be sensed
[3195.08 → 3196.32] through our five senses,
[3196.48 → 3198.14] through the material sense.
[3198.46 → 3199.32] I have to touch it,
[3199.36 → 3200.04] I have to taste it,
[3200.06 → 3200.66] I have to see it,
[3200.68 → 3201.34] I have to smell it,
[3201.48 → 3202.46] I have to hear it.
[3203.70 → 3206.52] And that ended up creating this gap,
[3206.68 → 3208.68] this missing room.
[3208.82 → 3211.44] There was no room left for transcendence
[3211.44 → 3213.92] or for mystery or for enchantment.
[3215.06 → 3216.30] In that frame,
[3216.30 → 3219.28] religion became the nonsense
[3219.28 → 3221.82] of secular rationalism.
[3222.46 → 3225.42] And the goal of this sort of secular frame
[3225.42 → 3227.78] was to disenchant the world.
[3228.74 → 3230.74] The Enlightenment project aimed
[3230.74 → 3232.00] to make sense of the world
[3232.00 → 3233.48] by demystifying it.
[3234.34 → 3235.44] And in so doing,
[3235.56 → 3238.96] it made certain kinds of sense-making impossible.
[3240.34 → 3240.98] Now again,
[3241.04 → 3242.24] we've seen shifts, right?
[3242.24 → 3242.98] In large part,
[3242.98 → 3245.40] in reaction to the extremes of that.
[3245.80 → 3246.54] In large part,
[3246.64 → 3248.86] recognition of the anemic void
[3248.86 → 3250.06] that that left behind
[3250.06 → 3251.90] when half of what it means to be human,
[3252.00 → 3252.90] because as humans,
[3253.04 → 3254.88] we are both body and soul,
[3255.08 → 3257.74] we are material and spiritual,
[3258.14 → 3259.78] and when half of that is cut off
[3259.78 → 3260.84] from being real,
[3261.18 → 3261.98] there's a reaction.
[3262.42 → 3263.90] And so postmodernism
[3263.90 → 3266.12] sort of deconstructs the notion
[3266.12 → 3268.76] of a unified and objective sense
[3268.76 → 3270.36] of the world.
[3271.16 → 3272.30] And in that move,
[3272.74 → 3272.90] right,
[3273.00 → 3274.68] grand narratives collapse
[3274.68 → 3278.16] and now exists multiple truths,
[3278.40 → 3280.00] each a sort of sense
[3280.00 → 3281.82] from within a community
[3281.82 → 3283.18] or within a story.
[3284.32 → 3285.56] But this too
[3285.56 → 3287.82] has kind of led to an exhaustion.
[3289.52 → 3289.70] Right?
[3289.80 → 3291.86] If everything is interpretation,
[3292.36 → 3293.46] which is what the French
[3293.46 → 3294.74] postmodern philosopher
[3294.74 → 3296.00] Jacques Derrida said,
[3296.00 → 3297.88] if everything is interpretation,
[3298.32 → 3299.40] can anything be true?
[3301.60 → 3302.80] Turns out,
[3303.12 → 3304.86] postmodernism didn't kill truth.
[3305.32 → 3306.54] It just revealed to us
[3306.54 → 3307.44] how much we need it.
[3308.72 → 3309.88] But now,
[3310.06 → 3311.24] we're living in this
[3311.24 → 3312.48] new,
[3312.68 → 3314.10] yet third
[3314.10 → 3315.84] sort of way.
[3316.02 → 3318.02] And people are calling this time
[3318.02 → 3319.64] various different names.
[3320.06 → 3321.00] Post-postmodernism,
[3321.82 → 3323.06] post-secularism
[3323.06 → 3323.80] is one.
[3323.80 → 3324.70] A new one
[3324.70 → 3325.72] that I recently learned
[3325.72 → 3327.30] is metamodernity.
[3329.56 → 3330.08] Metamodern
[3330.08 → 3330.68] is a term
[3330.68 → 3331.62] that I just learned
[3331.62 → 3332.18] at a lecture
[3332.18 → 3333.78] at TWU.
[3334.34 → 3335.06] It was the inaugural
[3335.06 → 3336.72] lecture for the chair
[3336.72 → 3337.88] of New Testament Studies,
[3338.04 → 3338.94] Dr. Kent Clark.
[3340.24 → 3340.98] And since then,
[3341.02 → 3341.62] I've been doing
[3341.62 → 3342.32] a deep dive
[3342.32 → 3343.86] into this sort of thing.
[3343.96 → 3344.18] And so,
[3344.26 → 3345.04] bear with me
[3345.04 → 3345.74] for a moment
[3345.74 → 3347.66] because I'm in a nerd out
[3347.66 → 3348.72] and I hope you can come along
[3348.72 → 3349.26] for the journey.
[3349.58 → 3350.34] But I think the payoff
[3350.34 → 3350.84] is great.
[3350.84 → 3352.92] And so,
[3353.02 → 3353.58] there are two
[3353.58 → 3354.34] contemporary
[3354.34 → 3356.30] cultural theorists
[3356.30 → 3358.16] by the name of
[3358.16 → 3359.08] Vermillion and
[3359.08 → 3359.70] Vandenacker
[3359.70 → 3361.84] who define
[3361.84 → 3363.30] metamodernism for us.
[3363.34 → 3363.84] And I'm going to share
[3363.84 → 3364.46] this with you.
[3366.46 → 3367.10] Metamodernism
[3367.10 → 3368.16] oscillates
[3368.16 → 3369.30] between the modern
[3369.30 → 3370.50] and the postmodern.
[3370.96 → 3371.90] It oscillates
[3371.90 → 3372.78] between a modern
[3372.78 → 3373.54] enthusiasm
[3373.54 → 3374.86] and a postmodern
[3374.86 → 3375.46] irony,
[3375.88 → 3376.78] between hope
[3376.78 → 3378.70] and melancholy,
[3378.70 → 3379.84] between naïveté
[3379.84 → 3381.16] and knowingness,
[3381.56 → 3381.92] empathy
[3381.92 → 3382.94] and apathy,
[3383.20 → 3383.48] unity
[3383.48 → 3384.54] and plurality,
[3384.70 → 3385.24] totality
[3385.24 → 3386.24] and fragmentation,
[3386.68 → 3386.98] purity
[3386.98 → 3388.02] and ambiguity.
[3391.72 → 3392.88] I don't know
[3392.88 → 3394.86] how you
[3394.86 → 3395.42] have been
[3395.42 → 3395.94] experiencing
[3395.94 → 3396.94] life lately,
[3397.66 → 3398.72] but for the people
[3398.72 → 3399.60] that I talk to
[3399.60 → 3400.10] and honestly,
[3400.22 → 3400.86] especially those
[3400.86 → 3401.52] under 35,
[3402.00 → 3402.82] this is it.
[3404.76 → 3405.94] Vermillion goes on
[3405.94 → 3406.40] and he says,
[3406.40 → 3407.58] grand narratives
[3407.58 → 3409.10] are as necessary
[3409.10 → 3410.26] as they are problematic.
[3411.42 → 3412.60] Hope is not simply
[3412.60 → 3413.90] something to distrust.
[3414.36 → 3415.62] Love is not necessarily
[3415.62 → 3417.08] something to be ridiculed.
[3418.74 → 3419.38] And all of this
[3419.38 → 3420.12] kind of echoes
[3420.12 → 3421.38] what Charles Taylor
[3421.38 → 3423.02] describes,
[3423.44 → 3423.70] I think,
[3423.80 → 3424.34] perfectly
[3424.34 → 3425.68] the way of
[3425.68 → 3426.60] sense-making
[3426.60 → 3427.64] for people today.
[3428.14 → 3428.46] And again,
[3428.52 → 3428.88] like I said,
[3428.94 → 3429.68] especially for those
[3429.68 → 3430.70] who are younger than I am.
[3431.16 → 3432.02] We live in this
[3432.02 → 3433.34] post-secular age
[3433.34 → 3434.40] not because
[3434.40 → 3435.76] everyone believes,
[3435.76 → 3436.74] but because
[3436.74 → 3437.94] everyone is feeling
[3437.94 → 3439.24] the pull of belief
[3439.24 → 3440.00] in some way.
[3441.22 → 3441.74] One writer
[3441.74 → 3442.36] described it
[3442.36 → 3442.66] and said,
[3442.98 → 3443.96] as much as it
[3443.96 → 3444.88] seemed real,
[3445.64 → 3446.46] it also appeared
[3446.46 → 3446.94] foolish.
[3447.88 → 3448.88] As much as he
[3448.88 → 3449.62] believed it,
[3450.14 → 3450.90] he doubted it.
[3452.72 → 3453.30] Our
[3453.30 → 3453.94] meta-modern
[3453.94 → 3454.44] world,
[3454.64 → 3455.28] the context
[3455.28 → 3455.94] where we now
[3455.94 → 3456.58] believe,
[3456.90 → 3458.38] is cut through
[3458.38 → 3460.08] with the cross-pressures
[3460.08 → 3461.12] of secular life
[3461.12 → 3462.60] denying transcendence
[3462.60 → 3463.32] and the spiritual
[3463.32 → 3464.94] and that is also
[3464.94 → 3466.34] permeated with the
[3466.34 → 3467.26] constant haunting
[3467.26 → 3468.16] of our souls
[3468.16 → 3469.34] longing for there
[3469.34 → 3470.10] to be more than
[3470.10 → 3471.36] what my eyes can see,
[3471.78 → 3472.52] longing for the
[3472.52 → 3473.48] transcendent and the
[3473.48 → 3475.06] spiritual to return
[3475.06 → 3476.56] knowing that it is
[3476.56 → 3476.84] real.
[3478.58 → 3479.74] The only thing
[3479.74 → 3480.72] that makes sense
[3480.72 → 3482.02] in the world today
[3482.02 → 3482.86] is that certain
[3482.86 → 3483.74] things won't make
[3483.74 → 3485.42] sense and I
[3485.42 → 3486.28] still believe them.
[3488.28 → 3489.52] Doubt and faith
[3489.52 → 3490.60] come as one
[3490.60 → 3491.60] in the world
[3491.60 → 3491.92] today.
[3493.56 → 3494.40] And as much
[3494.40 → 3495.12] as we believe
[3495.12 → 3496.30] and are convinced,
[3497.04 → 3497.64] doubt makes us
[3497.64 → 3497.96] wonder.
[3498.88 → 3499.62] And as much
[3499.62 → 3500.26] as we wonder
[3500.26 → 3500.94] and doubt,
[3501.20 → 3502.08] we also know
[3502.08 → 3502.80] with a personal
[3502.80 → 3504.12] certainty that
[3504.12 → 3505.06] this is the only
[3505.06 → 3505.68] thing that makes
[3505.68 → 3506.04] sense.
[3507.20 → 3508.36] At exactly the
[3508.36 → 3508.90] same time,
[3508.96 → 3509.68] I know this
[3509.68 → 3510.36] to be true
[3510.36 → 3511.24] and I
[3511.24 → 3512.58] can't imagine
[3512.58 → 3513.92] how this works.
[3515.78 → 3516.70] And I think
[3516.70 → 3518.52] that what God
[3518.52 → 3519.14] is drawing
[3519.14 → 3520.34] out for us
[3520.34 → 3521.18] to see this
[3521.18 → 3522.34] Resurrection Sunday
[3522.34 → 3523.60] 2,000 years
[3523.60 → 3524.62] later in a
[3524.62 → 3525.46] now meta-modern
[3525.46 → 3526.28] world as we're
[3526.28 → 3526.90] trying to make
[3526.90 → 3527.62] sense of this
[3527.62 → 3528.94] story is that
[3528.94 → 3529.92] yes, the
[3529.92 → 3531.00] resurrection does
[3531.00 → 3532.40] not fit their
[3532.40 → 3532.96] world.
[3533.80 → 3534.52] That's why the
[3534.52 → 3535.32] women's message
[3535.32 → 3536.10] seemed like
[3536.10 → 3536.68] nonsense.
[3537.88 → 3538.74] But the reality
[3538.74 → 3539.38] for us, the
[3539.38 → 3540.28] greater reality,
[3540.60 → 3541.14] the truer
[3541.14 → 3542.90] reality is that
[3542.90 → 3544.82] Jesus and his
[3544.82 → 3545.64] resurrection
[3545.64 → 3547.38] isn't
[3547.38 → 3548.38] nonsense,
[3549.14 → 3550.14] it's the
[3550.14 → 3551.28] start of a
[3551.28 → 3552.16] new sense,
[3552.80 → 3554.00] a new sense
[3554.00 → 3554.96] of seeing the
[3554.96 → 3555.88] world, a new
[3555.88 → 3556.50] sense of
[3556.50 → 3557.30] understanding the
[3557.30 → 3557.90] world, a new
[3557.90 → 3559.10] creation, a new
[3559.10 → 3559.60] cosmos.
[3560.18 → 3560.60] Resurrection
[3560.60 → 3561.60] faith is not
[3561.60 → 3563.18] irrational, it's
[3563.18 → 3564.50] supra-rational,
[3564.76 → 3565.96] it remakes the
[3565.96 → 3566.62] imagination.
[3567.44 → 3568.06] The resurrection
[3568.06 → 3569.94] redefines what is
[3569.94 → 3571.10] possible and so
[3571.10 → 3571.72] the resurrection
[3571.72 → 3573.26] offers for us a
[3573.26 → 3574.48] new sense of
[3574.48 → 3575.52] what makes sense.
[3577.16 → 3577.86] And here's the
[3577.86 → 3578.24] thing.
[3579.94 → 3581.60] Faith, faith
[3581.60 → 3582.96] involves a
[3582.96 → 3583.98] commitment to a
[3583.98 → 3585.32] particular way of
[3585.32 → 3586.84] understanding the
[3586.84 → 3589.06] world, which
[3589.06 → 3590.80] itself becomes a
[3590.80 → 3592.24] lens through which
[3592.24 → 3593.74] evidence is
[3593.74 → 3594.32] interpreted.
[3595.66 → 3596.66] And so faith is
[3596.66 → 3598.16] not belief in spite
[3598.16 → 3600.22] of evidence, faith
[3600.22 → 3601.76] is belief in a new
[3601.76 → 3602.90] kind of evidence.
[3603.72 → 3604.48] That's what the
[3604.48 → 3605.38] resurrection does.
[3605.38 → 3606.94] And in fact, I
[3606.94 → 3607.78] think as Christians,
[3608.02 → 3608.94] we want to go even
[3608.94 → 3609.40] further.
[3610.80 → 3611.46] The resurrection
[3611.46 → 3612.72] provides not just a
[3612.72 → 3614.30] new, but the
[3614.30 → 3615.92] necessary framework
[3615.92 → 3617.52] for making sense of
[3617.52 → 3617.94] the world.
[3618.66 → 3619.48] And without the
[3619.48 → 3620.94] resurrection, actually,
[3621.26 → 3622.30] the world lacks
[3622.30 → 3623.08] coherence.
[3624.62 → 3625.86] It's without the
[3625.86 → 3626.80] resurrection that the
[3626.80 → 3627.52] world doesn't make
[3627.52 → 3627.90] sense.
[3628.38 → 3629.42] It turns out that the
[3629.42 → 3630.96] resurrection is not
[3630.96 → 3631.60] nonsense.
[3632.06 → 3633.18] The world without the
[3633.18 → 3634.40] resurrection is
[3634.40 → 3635.02] nonsense.
[3637.82 → 3638.84] Make no mistake
[3638.84 → 3639.38] about it.
[3640.20 → 3641.82] The sense-making
[3641.82 → 3643.24] crisis that's
[3643.24 → 3643.92] happening in the
[3643.92 → 3644.46] world today, this
[3644.46 → 3645.28] meaning-making
[3645.28 → 3646.38] crisis that we find
[3646.38 → 3647.50] ourselves living in
[3647.50 → 3648.88] the midst of, is a
[3648.88 → 3649.96] spiritual crisis.
[3650.20 → 3651.06] It's perhaps the
[3651.06 → 3652.78] spiritual crisis of
[3652.78 → 3653.36] our age.
[3653.36 → 3655.64] And in an age of
[3655.64 → 3657.34] information overload and
[3657.34 → 3659.20] meaning fragmentation, we
[3659.20 → 3660.18] don't lack data.
[3660.96 → 3662.20] We lack sense.
[3663.06 → 3664.16] We lack the thing that
[3664.16 → 3664.96] holds it together.
[3665.08 → 3666.12] We lack something that
[3666.12 → 3667.40] pulls it all together to
[3667.40 → 3668.42] give it meaning and
[3668.42 → 3670.00] purpose and truth and
[3670.00 → 3670.70] reality.
[3671.60 → 3673.88] The resurrection speaks
[3673.88 → 3675.36] into that crisis.
[3675.90 → 3677.64] Not as one more
[3677.64 → 3679.20] competing narrative in a
[3679.20 → 3679.82] list of other
[3679.82 → 3680.74] narratives, but the
[3680.74 → 3681.94] resurrection is actually
[3681.94 → 3683.68] the one true story that
[3683.68 → 3684.80] reorders all other
[3684.80 → 3685.42] stories.
[3686.52 → 3687.86] Turns out the cross and
[3687.86 → 3688.68] the resurrection of
[3688.68 → 3689.96] Jesus are not just
[3689.96 → 3691.18] events within the
[3691.18 → 3691.52] world.
[3691.80 → 3692.58] The cross and the
[3692.58 → 3693.48] resurrection of Jesus
[3693.48 → 3695.30] are events upon which
[3695.30 → 3697.74] the world hinges, on
[3697.74 → 3698.76] which the world turns.
[3699.28 → 3701.06] Everything changes with
[3701.06 → 3701.86] the resurrection of
[3701.86 → 3702.28] Jesus.
[3704.00 → 3704.64] Because of the
[3704.64 → 3705.76] resurrection, Jeremy
[3705.76 → 3707.80] Treat says, because of
[3707.80 → 3709.04] the resurrection, the
[3709.04 → 3710.80] cross becomes not only the
[3710.80 → 3711.86] centre of redemptive
[3711.86 → 3713.36] history, but also the
[3713.36 → 3714.46] fulcrum upon which the
[3714.46 → 3715.76] logic of the world is
[3715.76 → 3716.98] turned upside down.
[3717.84 → 3719.16] Shame is transformed into
[3719.16 → 3720.86] glory, foolishness into
[3720.86 → 3722.80] wisdom, humiliation into
[3722.80 → 3723.70] exaltation.
[3725.06 → 3727.38] In fact, it's only by the
[3727.38 → 3728.54] resurrection and the
[3728.54 → 3729.80] power of the resurrection
[3729.80 → 3731.36] can some of the most
[3731.36 → 3733.56] awful things begin to make
[3733.56 → 3734.00] sense.
[3734.74 → 3737.12] Now carefully, don't hear
[3737.12 → 3737.84] what I'm not saying.
[3737.84 → 3740.28] Okay, I'm not trying to
[3740.28 → 3741.48] pretend that your trauma
[3741.48 → 3742.70] is reasonable.
[3744.28 → 3744.74] Right?
[3744.76 → 3745.66] I'm not trying to say that
[3745.66 → 3746.70] the death of your child
[3746.70 → 3747.98] adds up to something
[3747.98 → 3748.42] greater.
[3749.72 → 3750.22] Right?
[3750.28 → 3750.98] Don't hear that.
[3751.84 → 3753.82] What I'm saying is that
[3753.82 → 3755.62] only if the resurrection
[3755.62 → 3757.52] is real can the most
[3757.52 → 3759.16] awful parts of your life
[3759.16 → 3760.12] be redeemed.
[3761.24 → 3761.74] Right?
[3761.78 → 3762.98] If the resurrection isn't
[3762.98 → 3764.20] real, we are most of all
[3764.20 → 3765.64] to be pitied because we are
[3765.64 → 3766.82] stuck in this pointless
[3766.82 → 3767.34] trauma.
[3767.54 → 3768.96] We are stuck in pointless
[3768.96 → 3770.12] trauma after pointless
[3770.12 → 3770.54] trauma.
[3770.84 → 3772.32] And that, that's what
[3772.32 → 3773.22] doesn't make sense.
[3774.74 → 3776.50] The resurrection is not
[3776.50 → 3777.26] nonsense.
[3777.52 → 3778.84] The resurrection is a new
[3778.84 → 3779.54] sense.
[3779.66 → 3781.74] It is a call to reorient our
[3781.74 → 3783.38] entire interpretive framework
[3783.38 → 3784.86] towards resurrection.
[3786.26 → 3786.38] Right?
[3786.46 → 3788.76] Life only makes sense in
[3788.76 → 3789.96] light of the resurrection.
[3790.46 → 3791.90] Without the resurrection,
[3792.28 → 3793.90] death has the last word.
[3794.30 → 3796.06] Death is the only thing in the
[3796.06 → 3797.30] end that makes sense if the
[3797.30 → 3798.44] resurrection is not real.
[3800.58 → 3802.02] And can I be candid with you?
[3802.86 → 3804.38] Because even if you're not
[3804.38 → 3806.54] yet a Christian, notice my
[3806.54 → 3807.04] language there.
[3807.80 → 3809.12] Even if you're not yet a
[3809.12 → 3811.20] Christian, you intuit this.
[3811.20 → 3811.76] You know this.
[3812.44 → 3814.54] You know this in your soul,
[3814.70 → 3816.48] even if you can't make sense of
[3816.48 → 3817.18] it in your brain.
[3817.98 → 3818.14] Right?
[3818.24 → 3819.48] Death isn't the end.
[3820.02 → 3820.82] Death is defeated.
[3821.70 → 3823.30] Resurrection redefines your
[3823.30 → 3825.20] experience of death, and it
[3825.20 → 3827.12] redefines your experience of life
[3827.12 → 3827.88] now.
[3829.02 → 3830.96] Jesus' resurrection means that by
[3830.96 → 3833.64] his power, we too are raised to
[3833.64 → 3835.04] a new life.
[3835.94 → 3837.56] Jesus' resurrection means that in
[3837.56 → 3840.40] this life, right now, we live
[3840.40 → 3841.22] resurrection.
[3841.62 → 3843.52] We practice resurrection.
[3843.78 → 3845.82] We live resurrection now.
[3846.64 → 3848.74] To believe in the resurrection is to
[3848.74 → 3851.30] believe that God has interrupted the
[3851.30 → 3853.42] nonsense of death with a deeper
[3853.42 → 3854.50] logic of love.
[3857.00 → 3860.18] Eugene Peterson, talking about the
[3860.18 → 3862.92] practice of resurrection, says the
[3862.92 → 3863.22] following.
[3863.34 → 3863.68] He says,
[3863.68 → 3865.70] The practice of resurrection is an
[3865.70 → 3868.40] intentional, deliberate decision to
[3868.40 → 3870.04] believe and participate in
[3870.04 → 3871.10] resurrection life.
[3871.38 → 3872.50] Life out of death.
[3872.70 → 3874.20] Life that trumps death.
[3874.36 → 3875.72] Life that is the last word.
[3875.90 → 3877.02] Jesus' life.
[3877.88 → 3879.76] This practice is not a vague wish
[3879.76 → 3882.00] upwards, but comprises a number of
[3882.00 → 3884.38] discreet and interlocking acts that
[3884.38 → 3886.94] maintain a credible and faithful way of
[3886.94 → 3887.34] life.
[3887.74 → 3890.90] Real life in a world preoccupied with
[3890.90 → 3892.56] death and the devil.
[3893.68 → 3897.48] Resurrection life means faith in an
[3897.48 → 3898.52] age of nonsense.
[3899.00 → 3901.12] It means hope in a hopeless world.
[3901.94 → 3904.04] It means deep feeling when everyone
[3904.04 → 3905.08] else is apathetic.
[3905.74 → 3907.96] It means fighting for justice when the
[3907.96 → 3908.92] battle seems lost.
[3909.52 → 3912.14] It means loving those who persecute
[3912.14 → 3912.32] you.
[3912.54 → 3914.10] It means praying for your enemies.
[3914.26 → 3916.20] It means feeding the hungry, healing
[3916.20 → 3916.66] the sick.
[3916.74 → 3918.84] It means remembering the forgotten.
[3918.84 → 3923.02] Listen, in an age of nonsense, people
[3923.02 → 3926.00] will see what you are doing as you
[3926.00 → 3928.60] practice resurrection and Lord willing,
[3928.80 → 3930.52] it will finally click for them.
[3931.74 → 3933.50] That makes sense.
[3934.44 → 3935.16] They will see.
[3937.30 → 3940.12] Justin Brier ley in his book, The
[3940.12 → 3942.70] Surprising Rebirth of Belief in God.
[3942.70 → 3944.74] And this is the subtitle of the book.
[3944.82 → 3946.58] This is why I picked it up in the first
[3946.58 → 3946.84] place.
[3946.90 → 3950.72] The subtitle, why new atheism grew old and
[3950.72 → 3952.24] secular thinkers are considering
[3952.24 → 3953.24] Christianity again.
[3954.36 → 3957.70] In that book, he concludes saying, the
[3957.70 → 3960.42] most fruitful way we can introduce people
[3960.42 → 3962.96] to the Christian story is through the realm
[3962.96 → 3965.26] of the imagination rather than the
[3965.26 → 3965.78] intellect.
[3965.78 → 3968.34] And we do that, and here's what I want
[3968.34 → 3970.36] us to hear, we do that by making people
[3970.36 → 3973.20] want Christianity to be true in the
[3973.20 → 3976.36] first place, by showing what it means in
[3976.36 → 3978.72] our deepest instincts about what matters
[3978.72 → 3979.28] most.
[3980.34 → 3984.40] Only then can apologetics work, the work of
[3984.40 → 3987.24] showing them why it's true, be of any
[3987.24 → 3987.56] use.
[3990.80 → 3993.06] We do that by making people want
[3993.06 → 3995.24] Christianity to be true in the first
[3995.24 → 3998.06] place, by showing how it meets our deepest
[3998.06 → 4000.58] instincts about what matters most.
[4001.20 → 4002.82] This is what the resurrection does.
[4004.62 → 4005.76] And this is something that I have been
[4005.76 → 4007.98] thinking about actively for about 10
[4007.98 → 4008.72] years, right?
[4009.70 → 4011.40] Imagination as engagement.
[4012.38 → 4014.32] Aesthetics as apologetics.
[4014.38 → 4016.12] And that's one of the reasons why I love
[4016.12 → 4017.60] art, to the chagrin of my wife.
[4017.64 → 4019.18] When we go on a trip, and we go to an art
[4019.18 → 4021.78] museum, she sits somewhere by herself and I
[4021.78 → 4022.98] spend hours looking around.
[4022.98 → 4024.92] That's one of the reasons why I love
[4024.92 → 4025.42] poetry.
[4027.10 → 4031.84] And to that end, as we come to the table, I
[4031.84 → 4035.62] want to end with a poem from Malcolm
[4035.62 → 4035.98] Get.
[4037.08 → 4040.94] We began Easter Friday, or Good Friday, with
[4040.94 → 4043.14] a poem from Melting Get.
[4043.14 → 4045.20] And I'd like to end, to transition to the
[4045.20 → 4047.84] table, with another poem from Get.
[4048.00 → 4051.64] A poem that exemplifies resurrection faith and
[4051.64 → 4054.00] doubt in an age of nonsense.
[4055.24 → 4056.78] So this will not be on the screen.
[4057.34 → 4059.32] This poetry needs to be heard.
[4059.32 → 4069.74] As though some heavy stone were rolled away, you find an open door where all was closed,
[4069.98 → 4072.60] wide as an empty tomb on Easter day.
[4074.48 → 4080.28] Lost in your own dark wood, alone astray, you pause.
[4080.68 → 4085.22] As though some secret was disclosed, as though some heavy stone were rolled away.
[4085.22 → 4093.74] You glimpse the sky above you, wane and gray, wide as though those shadowed branches interposed,
[4093.88 → 4097.04] wide as an empty tomb on Easter day.
[4097.94 → 4101.56] Perhaps there's light enough to find your way.
[4101.70 → 4106.98] For now the tangled wood feels less enclosed, as though some heavy stone were rolled away.
[4106.98 → 4116.84] You lift your feet out of the miry clay and seek the light in which you once reposed wide as an empty tomb on Easter day.
[4117.36 → 4120.44] And then love calls your name.
[4121.18 → 4128.46] You hear him say, the way is open, death has been deposed, as though some heavy stone were rolled away.
[4128.64 → 4134.02] And you are free at last on Easter day.
[4135.06 → 4135.62] Amen.
[4135.62 → 4135.82] Amen.
[4136.72 → 4137.66] Let's pray together.
[4145.10 → 4151.24] Father God, speak to our hearts now.
[4151.36 → 4154.04] Speak to our imaginations now.
[4154.40 → 4159.98] Help us to make a new sense of the world by the truth of your resurrection.
[4159.98 → 4175.38] Father God, for so many of us this morning, the certainty of this truth and the impossibility of it live side by side in our everyday ordinary experiences.
[4175.38 → 4182.18] And so we pray that you would bring about a new creation.
[4182.18 → 4186.74] Allow us to see the world in this new sense.
[4186.74 → 4197.94] May this resurrection go from a story that someone tells me at church to the story that makes sense of the whole world as I go from this place.
[4197.94 → 4203.68] Transform us, Lord Jesus, by your word and by the work of your spirit.
[4203.68 → 4206.74] Transform us now as we come to your table.
[4206.74 → 4210.94] Father, that what we have heard, that what we have heard we might take in.
[4211.70 → 4219.54] And that as bread and juice nourish the body, that we might be nourished by your presence among us.
[4219.54 → 4228.08] Father, it is only because the resurrection is real that we meet you here at this table.
[4228.90 → 4235.54] And so make that truth even more real to us today, we pray, in the name of Jesus Christ.
[4236.20 → 4238.42] All God's people said, Amen.
[4238.42 → 4251.68] As we come to the table, of course, there's an Easter liturgy that will shape our encounter here.
[4252.34 → 4256.24] And so I'm going to invite you, as you see the words appear on the screen behind me,
[4256.28 → 4263.46] to speak those that are marked for you as we gather in the presence of our King together.
[4264.20 → 4266.94] I invite you to join in the following prayer.
[4268.42 → 4272.90] This is the feast of victory for our God.
[4273.50 → 4276.80] Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[4277.64 → 4280.74] Worthy is Christ, the Lamb who was slain.
[4281.46 → 4289.06] Worthy is Christ, the Lamb who was slain, whose blood set us free to be people of God.
[4290.28 → 4293.62] This is the victory, victory for our God.
[4294.30 → 4296.90] Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[4296.90 → 4300.76] Worthy is Christ, the Lamb who was slain.
[4300.76 → 4307.22] Power, riches, wisdom, and strength, and honour, and blessing, and glory are His.
[4308.56 → 4311.82] This is the feast of victory for our God.
[4312.56 → 4315.22] Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[4316.18 → 4319.06] Worthy is Christ, the Lamb who was slain.
[4320.18 → 4325.04] Sing with all the people of God and join in the hymn of all creation.
[4325.04 → 4328.04] This is the feast of victory for our God.
[4328.34 → 4330.54] Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[4332.10 → 4335.24] Worthy is Christ, the Lamb who was slain.
[4336.10 → 4342.18] Blessing, honour, and glory, and might be to God and to the Lamb forever.
[4342.84 → 4343.20] Amen.
[4343.20 → 4343.32] Amen.
[4344.54 → 4350.78] We celebrate this feast in obedience to Christ's example and mandate.
[4351.82 → 4356.36] The Lord Jesus, on the night that He was betrayed, took bread.
[4357.16 → 4360.08] And when He had given thanks, He broke it and said,
[4360.44 → 4362.82] This is my body, which is for you.
[4363.46 → 4365.90] Do this in remembrance of me.
[4365.90 → 4371.40] And in the same way, He took the cup after supper, saying,
[4372.22 → 4375.18] This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[4375.80 → 4380.78] Do this whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.
[4381.28 → 4383.72] For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup,
[4383.84 → 4388.04] you proclaim the Lord's death until He comes again.
[4389.38 → 4392.32] Come then, for all is ready.
[4393.08 → 4395.00] Christ was raised to life.
[4395.00 → 4396.60] Death is swallowed up.
[4396.70 → 4397.80] Victory is won.
[4398.14 → 4398.58] Hallelujah.
[4399.14 → 4401.82] Therefore, let us keep the feast.
[4402.44 → 4402.84] Hallelujah.
[4404.54 → 4406.00] Come to this table.
[4406.72 → 4411.02] If you're filled with faith, and if your faith is mixed with doubt,
[4411.80 → 4416.18] if you haven't come and been a regular to this feast,
[4416.60 → 4420.34] you are invited to come and taste faith.
[4420.88 → 4424.06] If you have tried to follow Jesus, and if you have failed,
[4424.06 → 4425.84] come to this table, come to this table,
[4425.84 → 4429.64] because Jesus Christ is raised.
[4430.32 → 4434.94] Come, because it is Christ Jesus who welcomes you here.
[4436.48 → 4439.44] The gifts of God for the people of God.
[4440.04 → 4444.06] The feast of God for the people of God.
[4444.82 → 4445.14] Amen.
[4445.14 → 4451.28] As we come to this table together, we're going to do so in groups.
[4451.28 → 4455.16] We'll come up in our rows, and we'll form a circle here around the table.
[4455.68 → 4459.52] You will be given the tray of bread, and as it's passed to you,
[4459.64 → 4460.82] the person will say,
[4460.82 → 4463.78] the body of Christ given for you, and then as you pass it,
[4463.84 → 4465.22] you are invited to say the same.
[4465.68 → 4468.64] Likewise, with the juice that comes around, as it's passed to you,
[4468.82 → 4471.12] you will hear the blood of Christ shed for you,
[4471.16 → 4473.22] and you're invited to say the same.
[4473.92 → 4478.96] In the middle of each of the trays of bread is a little cup with gluten-free bread
[4478.96 → 4481.42] that you can take if you are required for that, too.
[4482.18 → 4485.72] We will have ushers who will indicate when it's your time to come up to the front.
[4486.34 → 4488.24] If you are unable to come up to the front,
[4488.32 → 4490.74] but would still like to receive the elements,
[4490.90 → 4492.44] please indicate that to the ushers,
[4492.56 → 4494.18] and they will meet you where you are at,
[4494.24 → 4496.96] and they will serve you in your seat in the same way.
[4497.84 → 4501.26] To begin, I'd like to invite the serving elders and the worship leaders
[4501.26 → 4504.98] to come up to the front, that they can have the first table,
[4504.98 → 4508.74] and then they'll lead us in singing and song as the rest of us go through.
[4509.46 → 4513.14] Likewise, as you are waiting to come or in lieu of coming,
[4513.22 → 4514.84] if you'd like to meet someone for prayer,
[4514.84 → 4517.20] there will be people in the foyer at the back
[4517.20 → 4519.40] who would love to meet you and pray with you.
[4519.68 → 4522.50] I invite the worship leaders and elders
[4522.50 → 4524.30] and those helping us serve to the front.
[4524.46 → 4525.46] Thank you.

[6006.62 → 6007.62] Amen.
[6007.62 → 6032.88] SDM
[6032.88 → 6037.32] At the end of our story from this morning,
[6038.40 → 6039.26] we read,
[6039.26 → 6041.60] Peter got up and ran to the tomb, bending over.
[6041.76 → 6044.22] He saw the strips of linen lying by themselves,
[6044.46 → 6048.68] and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.
[6050.56 → 6053.04] That's my prayer for you this morning,
[6053.70 → 6057.40] that you go away wondering what had happened.
[6058.44 → 6060.86] Whether you go away in the full conviction
[6060.86 → 6063.48] of the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
[6063.54 → 6066.86] or you go away full of wondering and doubt,
[6067.42 → 6070.74] know that it is God who goes with you,
[6071.10 → 6072.62] that you do not go alone.
[6072.72 → 6074.76] So I'm going to invite you, as you're able to stand,
[6075.42 → 6079.66] we'll receive the blessing of God this resurrection Sunday,
[6080.02 → 6083.34] and then we will conclude by singing together with one voice,
[6083.96 → 6084.80] My Redeemer Lives.
[6085.76 → 6088.72] Receive the blessing of our God.
[6090.86 → 6094.32] God, go before you to lead you.
[6095.02 → 6097.36] God, go behind you to protect you.
[6098.26 → 6100.78] God, go beneath you to support you.
[6101.14 → 6103.76] And God, go beside you to befriend you.
[6104.26 → 6106.34] Do not be afraid.
[6107.30 → 6110.32] The tomb is empty, and so you have no reason to fear.
[6110.64 → 6112.50] Do not be afraid.
[6112.50 → 6116.66] But go to practice resurrection.
[6116.98 → 6117.96] In Jesus' name.
[6118.60 → 6118.92] Amen.
[6118.92 → 6119.06] Amen.
[6119.06 → 6119.10] Amen.
[6119.10 → 6119.14] Amen.
[6119.14 → 6119.64] Amen.
[6142.10 → 6143.74] Amen.
[6143.82 → 6144.66] Amen.
[6144.66 → 6167.96] I cast my mind to Calvary
[6167.96 → 6176.46] Where Jesus bled and died for me
[6176.46 → 6183.46] I see His wounds, His hands, His feet
[6183.46 → 6190.84] My Saviour on that cursed tree
[6190.84 → 6202.94] His body bound and drenched in tears
[6202.94 → 6209.84] They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb
[6209.84 → 6217.84] The entrance sealed by heavy storm
[6217.84 → 6224.84] Messiah still and all alone
[6224.84 → 6237.14] Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God
[6237.14 → 6243.84] Oh, praise His name forevermore
[6243.84 → 6250.84] For endless days we will sing Your praise
[6250.84 → 6257.84] Oh, Lord, O Lord our God
[6257.84 → 6267.84] And on the third at break of dawn
[6267.84 → 6274.84] The Son of Heaven rose again
[6274.84 → 6278.84] Oh, trampled death
[6278.84 → 6281.84] Where is Your sting?
[6281.84 → 6289.84] The angels roar for Christ the King
[6289.84 → 6299.84] Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God
[6299.84 → 6306.84] Oh, praise His name forevermore
[6306.84 → 6313.84] For endless days we will sing Your praise
[6313.84 → 6320.84] Oh, Lord, O Lord our God
[6320.84 → 6331.84] He shall return in robes of white
[6331.84 → 6338.84] The blazing sun shall pierce the night
[6338.84 → 6345.84] And I will rise among the saints
[6345.84 → 6352.84] My gaze transmits on Jesus' face
[6352.84 → 6355.84] The name of the Lord our God
[6355.84 → 6359.84] Oh, praise His name forevermore
[6359.84 → 6360.84] O praise His name forevermore
[6360.84 → 6361.84] Oh, praise His name forevermore
[6361.84 → 6362.84] O praise His name forevermore
[6362.84 → 6364.84] O praise His name forevermore
[6364.84 → 6365.84] O praise His name forevermore
[6365.84 → 6369.84] O praise His name forevermore
[6369.84 → 6372.84] O praise His name forevermore
[6372.84 → 6384.84] O praise His name forevermore
[6384.84 → 6386.84] O praise His name
[6386.84 → 6393.08] Praise the name of the Lord our God.
[6393.08 → 6399.92] Oh, praise His name forevermore.
[6400.12 → 6406.08] For endless days we will sing Your praise.
[6407.06 → 6412.08] Oh, Lord, oh, Lord our God.
[6412.08 → 6420.34] Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God.
[6420.34 → 6427.22] Oh, praise His name forevermore.
[6427.52 → 6433.84] For endless days we will sing Your praise.
[6434.26 → 6439.28] Oh, Lord, oh, Lord our God.
[6439.28 → 6445.60] Oh, Lord, oh, Lord our God.
[6447.68 → 6453.44] Oh, Lord, oh, Lord our God.
[6453.44 → 6483.42] Oh, Lord our God.
[6483.44 → 6513.42] Oh, Lord our God.
[6513.44 → 6543.42] Oh, Lord our God.
[6543.44 → 6545.44] Oh, Lord our God.
[6545.44 → 6545.94] Oh, Lord our God.
[6545.94 → 6547.68] Oh, Lord our God.
[6547.68 → 6549.44] Oh, Lord our God.
[6562.10 → 6565.18] Oh, Lord our God.
[6565.18 → 6567.18] Tower

[6625.18 → 6627.18] Thank you
[6655.18 → 6685.16] Thank you
