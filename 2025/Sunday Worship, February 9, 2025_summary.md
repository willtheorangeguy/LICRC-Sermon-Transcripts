• Stories of faith are seen as fueling and shaping prayers for the saints to stand firm
• The text from 1 Thessalonians 3 is discussed, with a focus on Paul's longing and writing
• Paul was preaching in Thessalonica with Silas and Timothy
• Some Jews became jealous and started a riot, blaming the early Christians for causing trouble
• Jason and other early Christians were fined and likely put under watch
• The believers sent Paul, Silas, and Timothy to Berea, where they also stirred up trouble
• The Christians in Berea sent Paul down the coast to Athens, while Silas and Timothy stayed back
• Silas and Timothy eventually joined Paul in Corinth, where he stayed for a year and a half
• Timothy returned to Thessalonica and brought news of the church's faithfulness to Paul
• Paul wrote a letter of thanksgiving and encouragement to the church in Thessalonica around A.D. 50-51
• The Greek word "euangelizomai" is often translated as gospel or good news about Jesus' life, death, and resurrection.
• Paul treats perseverance in faith as a form of proclaiming the gospel.
• Perseverance in hard things of faith is a result of God's preservation by His grace.
• Standing firm to the end is part of proclaiming the gospel.
• The idea that perseverance is due to God's preservation by His grace has two key reasons why it matters for believers:
  • It means that whatever trial or hardship they face, God is working to preserve them through it.
  • This truth gives hope and encouragement in difficult times.
• The gospel can be proclaimed in and through life and story, even in times of overwhelming trial or death.
• Death and facing death is an opportunity to proclaim the truth of the gospel.
• A story from a person on their deathbed illustrates how dying can be a chance to declare one's faith.
• 1 Corinthians 15:54-57 teaches that death has been swallowed up in victory through Christ's resurrection, giving us victory over sin and death.
• Perseverance in faith and standing firm in the face of death
• The gospel as a source of victory over sin and death
• The preservation of believers through God's promise
• The implicit promise of God's love available to those who have accepted the truth of the gospel by faith
• The importance of doing God's will and trusting in His sovereignty
• The promise that none of those given to God will be lost, but raised up on the last day
• The truth that all things must work together for God's glory and good
• The foundation of confidence that comes from knowing God is preserving us through trials
• Persevering in trial and suffering as a lived message of God preserving us
• Despair and persecution are not inevitable outcomes of suffering
• Suffering can be a means of carrying the death of Jesus in one's body, allowing the life of Jesus to be manifested in others
• Being afflicted but not crushed is part of being a Christian
• Persecution and exclusion from certain groups or individuals may occur, but God will not forsake or forget those who suffer for their faith
• Suffering can tell the story of the gospel and proclaim Jesus Christ crucified
• Learning to suffer well as Christians is necessary
• The gospel is revealed through suffering and trials
• God's sovereignty is at work in our suffering, giving us confidence despite perplexing circumstances
• Gospel confidence shows up in humility, submission, service to others, and loving everyone around you
• True gospel confidence means trusting God's will and way, submitting to it, and acknowledging His right to decide what's best for us
• The importance of faithfulness in trials
• Stories about one's own and others' faith can fuel or strengthen their own faith
• Telling these stories is part of what God does to preserve us in our trials
• Sharing one's story can come back to help someone else when they need it, and hearing stories of God at work can encourage one's heart that God is working in their situation
• No matter how small or incomplete a person's story may seem, it can be used by God to change a life
• How you tell these stories matters, and telling them in a way that makes Jesus the hero is important
• Experiencing challenges and struggles
• Finding hope and faith in God's presence
• The importance of perseverance and trust in God's sovereignty
• Telling stories about God's involvement in life, using biblical support
• Integrating Scripture into personal narratives to reveal God's love and character.
• Testing one's understanding of God's work in the world through Scripture
• The importance of aligning personal stories with biblical truth and God's nature
• Not needing a "good" or "fixed" ending to share a story of God at work
• Embracing unresolved situations as opportunities for sharing God's story
• Recognizing that one's story can be used by God regardless of circumstances
• God's stories are meant to draw us towards the grand ending of His story, not a fake good ending
• The grand ending is the return of Jesus Christ and the consummation of all history
• Fixing our eyes on the great ending helps us tell our story in a way that proclaims the gospel
• By telling our story within the Bible's story, we can see God at work and how He will use it to preserve others
• The ultimate goal is to see God face-to-face again and have our love for Him increase.
• The Lord Jesus prays for the saints to endure suffering and be blameless and holy.
• He doesn't pray for an easy life, but for their love for each other to increase.
