[0.00 --> 3.92]  What are you doing? Where are you going?
[5.66 --> 7.88]  This is who?
[8.88 --> 9.68]  This is Mark's.
[9.68 --> 11.50]  Why do you find this is Mark's?
[11.50 --> 13.90]  Okay, that's good.
[13.90 --> 15.84]  Thank you.
[19.80 --> 28.00]  Here and now I'm in the fire and above my head.
[30.00 --> 37.20]  Being held under the pressure, don't know what'll be left.
[40.16 --> 48.92]  But it's here in the ashes, I'm finding treasures.
[50.44 --> 54.54]  He's making diamonds, diamonds.
[55.18 --> 58.92]  Making diamonds out of dust.
[58.92 --> 61.40]  He is reviving.
[61.98 --> 68.12]  And in his timing, he's making diamonds out of us.
[68.12 --> 73.32]  I'll surrender to the power of being crushed by love.
[77.32 --> 82.86]  Till the beauty that was hidden isn't covered up.
[82.86 --> 90.06]  Oh, it's not what I hoped for.
[90.06 --> 94.06]  It's something much better.
[94.06 --> 95.26]  He's making diamonds.
[95.26 --> 97.26]  He's making diamonds.
[97.26 --> 103.26]  He's making diamonds out of dust.
[103.26 --> 105.26]  He is reviving.
[105.26 --> 107.26]  And in his timing, he's making diamonds out of us.
[107.26 --> 114.46]  And in his timing, he's making diamonds out of us.
[114.46 --> 115.66]  Oh, the joy of the Lord.
[115.66 --> 119.04]  Oh, the joy of the Lord.
[119.04 --> 120.86]  It will be my strength.
[120.86 --> 122.06]  When the pressure is on.
[122.06 --> 123.06]  When the pressure is on.
[123.06 --> 124.06]  He's making diamonds.
[124.06 --> 126.06]  Oh, the joy of the Lord.
[126.06 --> 128.06]  It will be my strength.
[128.06 --> 129.26]  When the pressure is on.
[129.26 --> 130.26]  He's making diamonds.
[130.26 --> 131.26]  Oh, the joy of the Lord.
[131.26 --> 132.26]  It will be my strength.
[132.26 --> 133.26]  When the pressure is on.
[133.26 --> 134.26]  He's making diamonds.
[134.26 --> 137.26]  Oh, the joy of the Lord.
[137.26 --> 138.26]  Oh, the joy of the Lord.
[138.26 --> 139.46]  It will be my strength.
[139.46 --> 140.46]  Oh, the joy of the Lord.
[140.46 --> 141.46]  Oh, the joy of the Lord.
[141.46 --> 148.46]  And in his timing, he's making diamonds out of dust.
[148.46 --> 154.46]  Making diamonds out of dust.
[154.46 --> 164.46]  Oh, the joy of the Lord.
[164.46 --> 176.66]  Thank you.
[176.66 --> 181.66]  Thank you.
[181.66 --> 183.66]  Thank you.
[183.66 --> 195.66]  Thank you.
[195.66 --> 204.86]  I want you as you are, not as you ought to be.
[204.86 --> 218.06]  Won't you lay down your guard and come to me?
[218.06 --> 224.06]  The shame that grips you now is crippling.
[224.06 --> 229.06]  It breaks my heart to see your suffering.
[229.06 --> 232.26]  Cause I am for you.
[232.26 --> 236.26]  I'm not against you.
[236.26 --> 240.26]  If you want to know how far my love can go.
[240.26 --> 244.26]  Just how deep, just how wide.
[244.26 --> 247.86]  If you want to see how much you mean to me.
[247.86 --> 251.26]  Look at my hands, look at my side.
[251.26 --> 256.46]  Cause you can count the times that say you are forgiven.
[256.46 --> 260.46]  It's more than the drops in the ocean.
[260.46 --> 272.46]  Don't think you need to settle for a substitute.
[272.46 --> 277.66]  When I'm the only love that changes you.
[277.66 --> 281.66]  And I am for you.
[281.66 --> 285.66]  I'm not against you.
[285.66 --> 289.66]  I am for you.
[289.66 --> 293.66]  I'm not against you.
[293.66 --> 296.86]  If you want to know how far my love can go.
[296.86 --> 300.86]  Just how deep, just how wide.
[300.86 --> 304.46]  If you want to see how much you mean to me.
[304.46 --> 308.26]  Look at my hands, look at my side.
[308.26 --> 313.86]  If you can count the times that say you are forgiven.
[313.86 --> 324.06]  It's more than the drops in the ocean.
[324.06 --> 325.86]  Open your heart.
[325.86 --> 329.06]  It's time that we start again.
[329.06 --> 333.06]  Open your heart.
[333.06 --> 336.06]  It's time that we start again.
[336.06 --> 342.06]  If you want to know how far my love can go.
[342.06 --> 346.06]  Just how deep, just how wide.
[346.06 --> 349.26]  If you want to see how much you mean to me.
[349.26 --> 352.26]  Look at my hands, look at my side.
[352.26 --> 358.26]  So you can count the times that say you are forgiven.
[358.26 --> 363.26]  It's more than the drops in the ocean.
[363.26 --> 369.26]  The drops in the ocean.
[369.26 --> 373.46]  The drops in the ocean.
[373.46 --> 376.46]  The drops in the ocean.
[376.46 --> 379.46]  I am for you.
[379.46 --> 383.46]  I'm not against you.
[383.46 --> 387.46]  I am for you.
[387.46 --> 391.46]  I'm not against you.
[391.46 --> 401.06]  I am I
[401.06 --> 404.86]  This is clean for you.
[404.86 --> 434.06]  Good morning, everyone.
[434.86 --> 438.74]  Welcome to church this morning.
[438.74 --> 440.56]  An extra special welcome.
[440.56 --> 444.84]  If you are a guest with us this morning, we are grateful that you are here.
[445.16 --> 445.82]  My name is Chris.
[446.02 --> 451.20]  I'm one of the pastors here at Emanuel, and it's my privilege, along with these others,
[451.30 --> 453.22]  to lead in our worship this morning.
[453.30 --> 457.28]  Before we begin, in earnest, we have a couple announcements that we would like to make and
[457.28 --> 458.56]  just throw out to you.
[458.56 --> 459.56]  Thank you.
[459.56 --> 466.40]  First of all, as she's walking in, we want to congratulate Lisa and the Saints on winning
[466.40 --> 470.56]  the Langley Slow Pitch B Division.
[470.56 --> 476.98]  They defeated us, the Isotopes, yesterday in the tournament, and then went on to win.
[476.98 --> 479.56]  So congratulations, Lisa.
[479.56 --> 490.02]  But in all seriousness, on behalf of the Isotope team, thank you to all of you who came out
[490.02 --> 491.54]  and cheered us on.
[492.14 --> 496.76]  We have a reputation in this league as the best supported team.
[497.62 --> 499.16]  And so that's our fans who come out.
[499.24 --> 504.04]  So thank you to family and friends and people who'd use this as an opportunity for community.
[504.04 --> 505.86]  It's a real blessing for all of us.
[506.30 --> 508.08]  And we have a lot of fun while doing it as well.
[509.18 --> 511.04]  Also wanted to draw your attention.
[511.50 --> 515.30]  Maybe you saw it in the pre-service slideshow or in the e-bulletin that went out.
[515.44 --> 520.76]  But this past week, the Synod of the Christian Reformed Church was meeting.
[520.98 --> 528.64]  And so that's when elders, deacons, and pastors from all the different area churches come together
[528.64 --> 532.54]  for an annual meeting to discuss theology and the life of the church.
[532.54 --> 535.72]  That happened at Redeemer University in Hamilton.
[536.50 --> 541.50]  And I'm going to just walk through a quick recap of the decisions and the things that
[541.50 --> 542.94]  came out of that meeting.
[543.26 --> 546.48]  I was not there, but I did follow along and participate.
[546.78 --> 548.22]  And I spoke to some people who were.
[548.90 --> 552.76]  And so every year we do this in the multi-purpose room, following worship.
[553.46 --> 556.86]  Grab your coffee, hang out with your friends, fellowship for a little while, and eventually
[556.86 --> 560.70]  we'll move in there and I'll just kind of walk you through what took place.
[560.70 --> 568.12]  And then also on behalf of the deacons, just a reminder and encouragement that on July 12,
[568.36 --> 573.66]  we're having a food drive and pancake breakfast here where we invite the community and the
[573.66 --> 579.36]  neighborhood to come and bring bags full of food that we will then donate to the Langley
[579.36 --> 579.90]  Food Bank.
[580.04 --> 584.82]  And so please, there's a sign-up sheet for that, both in the preparing and distributing
[584.82 --> 589.00]  of bags as well as participating on that Saturday in different ways.
[589.06 --> 590.64]  So find that in the e-bulletin.
[590.84 --> 596.22]  If you have any questions, you can talk to any of myself or Pastor Kevin or any of the
[596.22 --> 598.90]  deacons and they would love to help get that together.
[599.68 --> 601.56]  I think that's it as far as announcements go.
[601.78 --> 603.80]  And so I'm going to invite you as you're able to stand.
[605.10 --> 609.58]  We together as a family of God can be welcomed into his presence.
[609.58 --> 614.32]  Following the receiving of God's greeting, I'm going to invite you to turn to those around
[614.32 --> 617.56]  you and then welcome them into our shared worship this morning.
[617.96 --> 619.38]  Receive the greeting of our God.
[620.80 --> 628.06]  Grace, mercy, peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son and our Savior,
[628.52 --> 630.76]  through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[631.58 --> 631.92]  Amen.
[639.58 --> 641.06]  Thank you.
[641.12 --> 641.32]  Amen.
[667.62 --> 668.02]  Thank you.
[668.02 --> 668.44]  Amen.
[668.44 --> 669.52]  Amen.
[669.58 --> 672.36]  Psalm 150 says,
[699.58 --> 705.20]  Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.
[706.02 --> 706.92]  Praise the Lord.
[729.58 --> 737.58]  To follow you today, I choose.
[739.26 --> 746.02]  To hear my yes to you today, I choose.
[747.64 --> 754.34]  To hear your voice today, I choose.

[837.88 --> 846.16]  As for me and my house, we will stand the light on you.
[846.16 --> 864.90]  As for me and my house, we will stand our eyes on you.
[864.90 --> 866.90]  To follow you today.
[870.64 --> 877.52]  Wonderful Counselor, everlasting Father.
[878.82 --> 885.60]  Eternal King, Lord of Hosts, willingly we follow.

[915.60 --> 916.60]  Today I choose.
[916.60 --> 917.60]  Today I choose.

[924.60 --> 926.60]  Today I choose.
[926.60 --> 930.60]  To hear your voice today, I live today.

[936.60 --> 937.60]  free.
[937.60 --> 939.60]  Today I choose.
[939.60 --> 948.88]  Today I choose.
[948.88 --> 953.60]  Adding a mystery.
[953.60 --> 956.60]  To mermaid.
[956.60 --> 986.58]  Thank you.
[986.60 --> 997.78]  I will worship with all of my heart.
[997.78 --> 1008.32]  I will praise you with all of my strength.
[1008.32 --> 1017.50]  I will seek you all of my name.
[1017.50 --> 1028.50]  I will follow all of your ways.
[1028.50 --> 1036.68]  I will give you all my worship.
[1037.68 --> 1042.50]  I will give you all my praise.
[1043.78 --> 1048.22]  You, Lord, I love to worship.
[1048.22 --> 1054.50]  You, Lord, I'm not worthy of my name.
[1054.50 --> 1057.40]  I will bow down.
[1057.40 --> 1059.82]  I will bow down.
[1059.82 --> 1062.22]  And hail you as King.
[1063.00 --> 1065.42]  Hail you as King.
[1065.42 --> 1068.60]  I will serve you.
[1068.60 --> 1071.00]  I will serve you.
[1071.00 --> 1073.14]  Give you everything.
[1074.06 --> 1076.60]  Give you everything.
[1076.88 --> 1079.60]  I will lift up.
[1079.66 --> 1081.42]  I will lift up.
[1082.10 --> 1084.42]  My eyes to your throne.
[1084.42 --> 1087.42]  My eyes to your throne.
[1087.42 --> 1090.42]  I will trust you.
[1090.42 --> 1092.42]  I will trust you.
[1092.42 --> 1095.42]  I will trust you, Lord.
[1095.42 --> 1098.42]  Trust in you, Lord.
[1098.42 --> 1104.42]  I will give you all my worship.
[1104.42 --> 1110.60]  I will give you all my praise.
[1110.60 --> 1115.60]  You, Lord, I love to worship.
[1115.60 --> 1121.80]  You, Lord, I'm worthy of my praise.
[1121.80 --> 1126.60]  I will give you all my worship.
[1126.60 --> 1132.70]  I will give you all my praise.
[1132.70 --> 1137.60]  You, Lord, I love to worship.
[1137.60 --> 1144.78]  You, Lord, I'm worthy of my praise.
[1150.96 --> 1156.08]  The words of Psalm 142 are our prayer of confession this morning.
[1156.42 --> 1157.62]  Join me in prayer.
[1160.18 --> 1162.06]  I cry aloud to the Lord.
[1162.40 --> 1165.14]  I lift up my voice to the Lord for mercy.
[1165.14 --> 1168.14]  I pour out before him my complaint.
[1168.14 --> 1171.14]  Before him I tell my trouble.
[1171.14 --> 1174.14]  When my spirit grows faint within me,
[1174.14 --> 1177.14]  it is you who watch over my way.
[1177.14 --> 1181.14]  In the path where I walk, people have hidden a snare for me.
[1181.14 --> 1182.14]  Look and see.
[1182.14 --> 1185.14]  There is no one at my right hand.
[1185.14 --> 1187.14]  No one is concerned for me.
[1187.14 --> 1189.14]  I have no refuge.
[1189.14 --> 1191.14]  No one cares for my life.
[1191.14 --> 1194.14]  No one cares for my life.
[1194.14 --> 1196.14]  I cry to the Lord.
[1196.14 --> 1202.14]  I say, you are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.
[1202.14 --> 1206.14]  Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need.
[1206.14 --> 1212.14]  Rescue me from those who pursue me, for they are too strong for me.
[1212.14 --> 1218.14]  Set me free from my prison, that I may praise your name.
[1218.14 --> 1223.14]  Then the righteous will gather about me because of your goodness to me.
[1223.14 --> 1241.14]  What gift of grace is Jesus my Redeemer?
[1241.14 --> 1249.14]  There is no more for heaven now to Him.
[1249.14 --> 1256.14]  He is my joy, my righteousness and freedom.
[1256.14 --> 1264.14]  My steadfast love, my deep and boundless peace.
[1264.14 --> 1272.14]  Through this I hold, my hope is only Jesus.
[1272.14 --> 1279.14]  For my life is wholly bound to His.
[1279.14 --> 1285.14]  Oh, how strange and divine I can see.
[1285.14 --> 1292.14]  All is mine, yet not I, but through Christ's name.
[1292.14 --> 1311.14]  The night is dark, but I am not forsaken.
[1311.14 --> 1319.14]  For by my side, the Savior He will stay.
[1319.14 --> 1326.14]  I later on, in weakness and rejoicing.
[1326.14 --> 1333.14]  For in my need, His power is misplaced.
[1333.14 --> 1341.14]  To this I hold, my shepherd will defend He.
[1341.14 --> 1348.14]  Through the deepest valley He will lead.
[1348.14 --> 1349.14]  Through the deepest valley of faith in me.
[1349.14 --> 1355.14]  All the light has been won, and I shall overcome.
[1355.14 --> 1363.14]  Yet not I, but through Christ's name.
[1363.14 --> 1379.52]  No fate I dread, I know I am forgiven
[1379.52 --> 1387.52]  The future's sure, the price it has been paid
[1387.52 --> 1393.92]  For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon
[1393.92 --> 1401.64]  And He was raised to overthrow the grave
[1401.64 --> 1408.02]  To this I hold, my sin has been defeated
[1408.02 --> 1415.52]  Jesus now and ever is my sin
[1415.52 --> 1419.72]  For the chains are released
[1419.72 --> 1423.42]  I can see I am free
[1423.42 --> 1428.22]  And God I, but through Christ is free
[1428.22 --> 1447.20]  With every breath I long to follow Jesus
[1447.20 --> 1454.52]  For He has said that He will bring me home
[1454.52 --> 1462.42]  And day by day I know He will renew me
[1462.42 --> 1468.72]  Until I stand with joy before the throne
[1468.72 --> 1476.62]  To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus
[1476.62 --> 1483.72]  All the glory evermore to live
[1483.72 --> 1490.62]  When the race is foundly, still my lips shall repeat
[1490.62 --> 1498.52]  Yet not I, but through Christ is free
[1498.52 --> 1504.52]  To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus
[1504.52 --> 1512.42]  All the glory evermore to Him
[1512.42 --> 1520.22]  When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat
[1520.22 --> 1526.42]  Yet not I, but through Christ will be
[1526.42 --> 1534.32]  Yet not I, but through Christ will be
[1534.32 --> 1556.12]  Lord's Day 32, question and answer 86
[1556.12 --> 1559.00]  Are the words that remind us of our assurance
[1559.00 --> 1561.30]  And our response to it
[1561.30 --> 1564.06]  Please read the answer with me
[1564.06 --> 1565.26]  The question
[1565.26 --> 1569.38]  Since we have been delivered by our misery by grace
[1569.38 --> 1572.30]  Through Christ without any merit of our own
[1572.30 --> 1575.10]  Why then should we do good works?
[1575.10 --> 1577.10]  Because Christ
[1577.10 --> 1577.60]  Because Christ
[1577.60 --> 1580.38]  Having redeemed us by His blood
[1580.38 --> 1583.78]  Is also restoring us by His spirit
[1583.78 --> 1585.40]  And He's in His image
[1585.40 --> 1587.98]  God has our whole lives
[1587.98 --> 1591.24]  He may show that we are thankful to God
[1591.24 --> 1596.08]  So that He may be raised for us
[1596.08 --> 1599.32]  So that we may be sure that our faith
[1599.32 --> 1600.32]  I am free
[1600.32 --> 1602.88]  And so that I have a body
[1602.88 --> 1620.26]  I stand amazed in the presence
[1620.26 --> 1626.26]  Of Jesus the Nazarene
[1626.26 --> 1635.26]  And wonder how He could love me
[1635.26 --> 1641.26]  Of sin and condemned and we
[1641.26 --> 1646.26]  We're singing
[1646.26 --> 1649.26]  How marvelous
[1649.26 --> 1653.26]  How marvelous
[1653.26 --> 1656.26]  And my song
[1656.26 --> 1660.26]  Shall ever be
[1660.26 --> 1663.26]  How marvelous
[1663.26 --> 1664.26]  How marvelous
[1664.26 --> 1665.26]  How marvelous
[1665.26 --> 1666.26]  How marvelous
[1666.26 --> 1667.26]  How marvelous
[1667.26 --> 1668.26]  How marvelous
[1668.26 --> 1671.26]  Is my Savior
[1671.26 --> 1672.26]  Is my Savior
[1672.26 --> 1673.26]  For glory
[1673.26 --> 1683.26]  He took my sins
[1683.26 --> 1684.26]  And my soul
[1684.26 --> 1692.50]  So old, he made them his very own.
[1692.50 --> 1707.22]  And he owed a burden to Calvary, and suffered and died of old.
[1707.22 --> 1721.22]  How marvelous, how wonderful, and my song shall ever be.
[1721.22 --> 1735.38]  How marvelous, how wonderful is my Savior's love for all of you.
[1737.22 --> 1753.22]  With the ransomed in glory, His face I am blessed as He.
[1753.22 --> 1767.22]  It will be my joy through the ages, to sing of His love for me.
[1767.22 --> 1784.22]  How marvelous, how wonderful, and my song shall ever be.
[1784.22 --> 1798.22]  How marvelous, how wonderful is my Savior's love for all of you.
[1798.22 --> 1800.22]  We're singing.
[1800.22 --> 1813.22]  How marvelous, how wonderful, and my song shall ever be.
[1813.22 --> 1828.22]  How marvelous, how wonderful is my Savior's love for all of you.
[1828.22 --> 1844.22]  How marvelous, how wonderful is my Savior's love for all of you.
[1844.22 --> 1847.22]  I'm going to bring up a few people to the front.
[1847.22 --> 1850.22]  I'm going to list them off, and I'm hoping you can just come up and join me here.
[1850.22 --> 1853.22]  First of all, I'd love for Rachel Malawaney.
[1853.22 --> 1854.22]  She's going to come for it.
[1854.22 --> 1855.22]  Malawaney, Malawani.
[1855.22 --> 1858.22]  I always say it wrong first, and then I get it right the second time.
[1858.22 --> 1859.22]  Malawani.
[1859.22 --> 1861.22]  Rachel has been our Children's Worship Time Coordinator this year,
[1861.22 --> 1864.22]  and so she stepped into the role in September, has done an excellent job.
[1864.22 --> 1869.22]  And she's here to help me introduce a few of our Grade 4 students.
[1869.22 --> 1879.22]  So I would like to invite up Alia Verkaik, Karis Nordum, Tyus Wind, Joel Klein-Geltink, Malachi De Winter, and Luca Vartstra.
[1879.22 --> 1881.22]  If you can come up to the front.
[1881.22 --> 1883.22]  Here they all come.
[1883.22 --> 1885.22]  They're all from the same side of the church.
[1885.22 --> 1886.22]  That's it. Here, come on this side of me.
[1886.22 --> 1887.22]  Let's go right here.
[1887.22 --> 1889.22]  You can stand right in front.
[1889.22 --> 1892.22]  There, we'll wait for everybody to come forward.
[1892.22 --> 1893.22]  There we go.
[1893.22 --> 1903.22]  Now these fine young folks here are about to go to their last Children's Worship Time ever as students.
[1903.22 --> 1904.22]  Hopefully they come back as leaders.
[1904.22 --> 1906.22]  But this is their last one.
[1906.22 --> 1908.22]  And so we wanted to acknowledge that.
[1908.22 --> 1910.22]  We're going to pray for them in a second.
[1910.22 --> 1913.22]  And we wanted to actually just give them a round of applause.
[1913.22 --> 1914.22]  So let's just give them...
[1914.22 --> 1922.22]  I'd also like to highlight, if I can, they've been in Children's Worship Time since they were in preschool,
[1922.22 --> 1925.22]  and I didn't do the math, but I think that's about seven-ish years.
[1925.22 --> 1929.22]  If you've been a Children's Worship Time teacher in the last seven years...
[1929.22 --> 1930.22]  So just think about it.
[1930.22 --> 1932.22]  Sit with that for a second.
[1932.22 --> 1936.22]  If you've been a Children's Worship Time teacher at all in the last seven years, can you stand up for a moment?
[1936.22 --> 1938.22]  Right now. Here we go.
[1938.22 --> 1939.22]  Whoop!
[1939.22 --> 1940.22]  I think there's more.
[1940.22 --> 1941.22]  I think there's more.
[1941.22 --> 1946.22]  But these are all people that have been in their lives over the last seven years as well.
[1946.22 --> 1950.22]  And so I think it's a really good, beautiful picture of the church at work.
[1950.22 --> 1954.22]  As we've had baptism stuff, we always promise to encourage and teach.
[1954.22 --> 1957.22]  And so we thank you all for being a part of their lives as well.
[1957.22 --> 1959.22]  We give them a round of applause too.
[1959.22 --> 1960.22]  Now...
[1963.22 --> 1967.22]  We have some Bibles. Rachel's going to help pass them out.
[1967.22 --> 1970.22]  Who do we have first here?
[1970.22 --> 1973.22]  This will take just but a minute.
[1973.22 --> 1976.22]  Alright, Luca. This is for you, my man.
[1976.22 --> 1978.22]  There you go. Congratulations to you.
[1978.22 --> 1982.22]  This Bible is for you to take to church as you listen to Pastor Chris preach.
[1982.22 --> 1984.22]  So as he's preaching, you can read your Bibles.
[1984.22 --> 1987.22]  We have Aaliyah. Aaliyah. Congratulations.
[1987.22 --> 1988.22]  This is for you.
[1988.22 --> 1990.22]  And then we've got...
[1992.22 --> 1994.22]  Tyus. Where's Tyus? There he is.
[1994.22 --> 1996.22]  Tyus. Congratulations, buddy.
[1996.22 --> 1998.22]  There we go.
[1998.22 --> 2000.22]  Next up.
[2000.22 --> 2002.22]  Joel. Where's Joel?
[2002.22 --> 2003.22]  Here he is.
[2003.22 --> 2005.22]  Joel. Congratulations.
[2005.22 --> 2006.22]  For you.
[2006.22 --> 2008.22]  And two left.
[2008.22 --> 2011.22]  This is in no particular order, everybody.
[2011.22 --> 2012.22]  No particular order.
[2012.22 --> 2013.22]  They just ended up in the bag.
[2013.22 --> 2015.22]  Malachi, you're next.
[2015.22 --> 2018.22]  Which of course leaves Charis.
[2018.22 --> 2019.22]  Congratulations for you too.
[2019.22 --> 2021.22]  Now what I'd love for you to do...
[2021.22 --> 2023.22]  Can you guys stand like right here in a row?
[2023.22 --> 2028.22]  And I'm going to invite up any family, any children's worship time teachers,
[2028.22 --> 2030.22]  or anybody at all who wants to come and lay...
[2030.22 --> 2031.22]  Any kids who want to do this?
[2031.22 --> 2032.22]  You can come up here.
[2032.22 --> 2035.22]  We're going to lay hands on these six young folks.
[2035.22 --> 2037.22]  We're just going to pray over them right now.
[2037.22 --> 2040.22]  So please make your way to the front and we'll do that right now.
[2040.22 --> 2041.22]  All right.
[2041.22 --> 2042.22]  All right.
[2042.22 --> 2043.22]  All right.
[2043.22 --> 2044.22]  All right.
[2044.22 --> 2046.22]  Church, let's bow our heads in prayer.
[2046.22 --> 2059.22]  Father God, we are so grateful that we have the opportunity to have children's worship time in this church.
[2059.22 --> 2060.22]  For all of the kids in this congregation, Lord.
[2060.22 --> 2061.22]  We thank you for them.
[2061.22 --> 2065.22]  We thank you for the life and the energy that they bring and for their desire to know you better, Lord.
[2065.22 --> 2071.22]  And we think especially of these six grade four students who have been a part of children's worship time for a long time.
[2071.22 --> 2072.22]  We're going to pray for them.
[2072.22 --> 2073.22]  We're going to pray for them.
[2073.22 --> 2078.22]  We thank you for the life and the energy that they bring and for their desire to know you better, Lord.
[2078.22 --> 2087.22]  And we think especially of these six grade four students who have been a part of children's worship time for a long time, who are going to their last children's worship time today.
[2087.22 --> 2100.22]  And God, as they conclude this part of their church life and as they join the rest of us in the greater body of Christ here on a Sunday mornings, God, we just pray that you continue to work in their hearts.
[2100.22 --> 2107.22]  May they continue to seek you and may the word of God that they are holding today, may that become ever more true to them as well.
[2107.22 --> 2109.22]  And so we thank you so much for them, Lord.
[2109.22 --> 2117.22]  May they be encouraged today and may you continue to put people in their lives to mentor them and shape them and may they seek you first in all things.
[2117.22 --> 2121.22]  And so God, we lift up these six to you in your name.
[2121.22 --> 2122.22]  Amen.
[2122.22 --> 2123.22]  All right.
[2123.22 --> 2124.22]  Thank you, everyone.
[2124.22 --> 2126.22]  You can make your way back to your seats.
[2126.22 --> 2136.22]  We're now going to have time for our offering.
[2136.22 --> 2139.22]  So I'm going to invite up whoever's coming forward to share that.
[2139.22 --> 2140.22]  Here.
[2148.22 --> 2149.22]  Good morning.
[2149.22 --> 2150.22]  My name is Yap.
[2150.22 --> 2152.22]  I'm a deacon here at Langley Emanuel.
[2152.22 --> 2156.22]  Before we do the offering here, I'd like to just introduce Phil from Advocate.
[2156.22 --> 2163.22]  He's going to come up and say a few words.
[2163.22 --> 2169.22]  Thank you.
[2169.22 --> 2172.22]  Good morning, Emanuel.
[2172.22 --> 2174.22]  Good to see you.
[2174.22 --> 2179.22]  This is, I must say, coming in here today.
[2179.22 --> 2184.22]  I feel like I'm being taken to my deep past.
[2184.22 --> 2193.22]  More than 1998, my wife and I moved to Langley and we were moved on to 205 A Street.
[2193.22 --> 2200.48]  Street and I was out in the yard cleaning up and moving our possessions
[2200.48 --> 2207.50]  into our home and this fellow came along who was a neighbor not too far away and
[2207.50 --> 2213.32]  he said he questioned me as to who I was and what I was doing and what my
[2213.32 --> 2222.78]  business was there and eventually the conversation turned to theology and he
[2222.78 --> 2234.36]  said oh by the way my name is Bert and and I'm so glad to see him here almost 30
[2234.36 --> 2242.64]  years ago today I work for advocate and I'm here for the purpose today to simply
[2242.64 --> 2249.78]  say thank you God bless you for being involved in our baby bottle campaign I
[2249.78 --> 2256.44]  have the privilege of connecting with churches on behalf of advocate and have
[2256.44 --> 2264.96]  the unbounded pleasure of coming and being with you and saying thank you for
[2264.96 --> 2272.36]  the difference you make many of you have probably taken a bottle home and filled
[2272.36 --> 2279.42]  filled it up with coins or paper as you have seen fit and you might be asking
[2279.42 --> 2290.64]  what difference does this really make is this just simply a symbol of support I
[2290.64 --> 2297.26]  thought of how I might explain that to you how I might define it for you today and I
[2297.26 --> 2302.38]  thought of statistics I thought of telling you about all the things we do as an
[2302.38 --> 2313.22]  organization but I thought perhaps a story might be best and I'll make it quick in
[2313.22 --> 2320.54]  February a young woman came into one of our centers as you know we have centers in
[2320.54 --> 2329.66]  Langley and Abbotsford and Prince George and she came in and met with one of our staff and said could
[2329.66 --> 2341.20]  you give me a pregnancy test and they said yes of course so after some conversation a pregnancy test
[2341.20 --> 2352.20]  occurred and then she was asked would you like to have an ultrasound and the young woman said yes I'd like
[2352.20 --> 2363.20]  that very much so our staff met with her and they gave her an ultrasound and it turned out that she was very
[2363.20 --> 2378.20]  very far along in pregnancy as the probe went over her abdomen and they looked they could see the outline of a child in utero
[2378.20 --> 2393.18]  this kid put on a show arms legs he might have even sort of been waving to say hello
[2393.18 --> 2403.34]  it was that good the show was outstanding and the woman looked at the screen and tears welled up in her eyes and she said
[2403.34 --> 2408.94]  how do I get rid of it
[2408.94 --> 2418.98]  and so she said please direct me to the nearest facility where this can happen
[2418.98 --> 2422.46]  our staff talked with her
[2422.46 --> 2426.26]  and eventually she went on her way
[2426.26 --> 2429.04]  two days later
[2429.04 --> 2432.14]  a text comes in
[2432.14 --> 2434.30]  and it's her
[2434.30 --> 2436.76]  and she says
[2436.76 --> 2440.56]  could I come back for another ultrasound
[2440.56 --> 2442.58]  could I come back
[2442.58 --> 2443.82]  with my boyfriend
[2443.82 --> 2447.58]  they came into the center
[2447.58 --> 2452.12]  they had the ultrasound
[2452.12 --> 2456.44]  the young man sat in his chair watching the ultrasound
[2456.44 --> 2458.22]  and he
[2458.22 --> 2461.12]  saw everything that was occurring
[2461.12 --> 2462.92]  but he was quite
[2462.92 --> 2464.86]  emotionally turned off
[2464.86 --> 2467.06]  until
[2467.06 --> 2468.88]  that child
[2468.88 --> 2472.96]  then put on an even better display
[2472.96 --> 2475.76]  than a couple of days before
[2475.76 --> 2479.30]  and all of the sudden
[2479.30 --> 2482.30]  this young man
[2482.30 --> 2484.40]  rises from his chair
[2484.40 --> 2485.58]  and says
[2485.58 --> 2487.32]  hold it
[2487.32 --> 2489.62]  is that happening
[2489.62 --> 2490.88]  right now
[2490.88 --> 2492.00]  inside of her
[2492.00 --> 2496.54]  and our staff members said
[2496.54 --> 2496.98]  yes
[2496.98 --> 2498.56]  indeed
[2498.56 --> 2501.62]  quite a show
[2501.62 --> 2502.16]  isn't it
[2502.16 --> 2505.76]  the young man stopped
[2505.76 --> 2506.32]  and said
[2506.32 --> 2509.14]  I'm not religious
[2509.14 --> 2511.90]  but I know
[2511.90 --> 2513.38]  that God
[2513.38 --> 2514.12]  did
[2514.12 --> 2515.10]  that
[2515.10 --> 2520.60]  the young woman
[2520.60 --> 2521.50]  turned her head
[2521.50 --> 2522.36]  from the wall
[2522.36 --> 2523.66]  toward
[2523.66 --> 2525.74]  her boyfriend
[2525.74 --> 2528.76]  tears by this point
[2528.76 --> 2529.68]  streaming down
[2529.68 --> 2530.34]  her cheeks
[2530.34 --> 2530.64]  smiling
[2530.64 --> 2534.88]  and he says
[2534.88 --> 2539.54]  this is our child
[2539.54 --> 2541.30]  we are keeping
[2541.30 --> 2542.58]  this
[2542.58 --> 2543.70]  baby
[2543.70 --> 2548.16]  the cost
[2548.16 --> 2549.72]  of an ultrasound
[2549.72 --> 2552.68]  is found
[2552.68 --> 2554.66]  in one of those bottles
[2554.66 --> 2557.24]  so
[2557.24 --> 2558.86]  if you're tempted to think
[2558.86 --> 2559.68]  if this bottle
[2559.68 --> 2561.08]  is just a
[2561.08 --> 2561.68]  symbol
[2561.68 --> 2564.18]  it's much more than that
[2564.18 --> 2566.12]  it is life
[2566.12 --> 2568.00]  the Bible
[2568.00 --> 2568.76]  tells us
[2568.76 --> 2570.50]  in the words of Jesus
[2570.50 --> 2572.70]  the evil one
[2572.70 --> 2573.52]  comes to
[2573.52 --> 2574.42]  seek
[2574.42 --> 2575.34]  to
[2575.34 --> 2576.98]  excuse me
[2576.98 --> 2578.38]  to destroy
[2578.38 --> 2579.56]  and lie
[2579.56 --> 2582.10]  I have come
[2582.10 --> 2583.94]  that they might have life
[2583.94 --> 2585.16]  and have it
[2585.16 --> 2587.36]  abundant
[2587.36 --> 2589.14]  God bless you
[2589.14 --> 2590.66]  thank you so much
[2590.66 --> 2591.86]  for the chance
[2591.86 --> 2592.72]  to be with you
[2592.72 --> 2593.72]  here today
[2593.72 --> 2603.00]  thank you
[2603.00 --> 2603.22]  Phil
[2603.22 --> 2604.00]  for that
[2604.00 --> 2607.32]  our offering
[2607.32 --> 2607.82]  this morning
[2607.82 --> 2608.54]  will be for
[2608.54 --> 2609.62]  New Ground
[2609.62 --> 2610.14]  which was
[2610.14 --> 2610.58]  formerly
[2610.58 --> 2611.82]  Operation Manna

[2627.48 --> 2628.64]  through community
[2628.64 --> 2629.88]  opportunity scans
[2629.88 --> 2634.90]  they provide

[2645.64 --> 2646.70]  as you're able to

[2648.26 --> 2649.16]  or any other ministry
[2649.16 --> 2649.82]  you can use
[2649.82 --> 2651.02]  the envelopes
[2651.02 --> 2651.84]  and the seats
[2651.84 --> 2652.78]  in front of you
[2652.78 --> 2653.50]  thank you
[2653.50 --> 2653.52]  thank you
[2653.52 --> 2654.32]  please
[2654.32 --> 2655.78]  expand this
[2655.78 --> 2657.24]  next time
[2657.24 --> 2665.52]  to the
[2665.52 --> 2666.14]  gathering
[2666.14 --> 2667.02]  about us
[2667.02 --> 2668.86]  we have to
[2669.10 --> 2671.64]  to put
[2671.64 --> 2672.30]  our
[2672.30 --> 2674.56]  narcissistic
[2674.56 --> 2689.44]  This is my desire to honor you
[2689.44 --> 2698.26]  Night without my heart I worship you
[2698.26 --> 2714.50]  All I have within me I give you praise
[2714.50 --> 2722.76]  All that I adore is in you
[2728.26 --> 2737.26]  Lord, I give you my heart I give you my soul
[2737.26 --> 2745.26]  I live for you alone Every breath that I take
[2745.26 --> 2756.26]  And love it my way I have your way in me
[2756.26 --> 2771.26]  This is my desire to honor you
[2771.26 --> 2781.26]  Night without my heart I worship you
[2781.26 --> 2798.26]  All I have within me I give you praise
[2798.26 --> 2805.26]  All that I adore is in you
[2805.26 --> 2820.26]  Lord, I give you my heart I give you my soul
[2820.26 --> 2828.26]  I live for you alone Every breath that I take
[2828.26 --> 2837.26]  And love it my way I have your way in me
[2837.26 --> 2846.26]  Lord, I give you my heart I give you my soul
[2846.26 --> 2854.26]  I live for you alone Every breath that I take
[2854.26 --> 2864.26]  And love it my way I have your way in me
[2864.26 --> 2879.26]  I give you my heart I give you my heart I give you my heart
[2879.26 --> 2884.26]  Good morning, I want to invite all the kids up to the front
[2884.26 --> 2891.26]  Preschool to grade four We'll have a quick chat and then we'll head off to children's worship time
[2891.26 --> 2899.26]  Come on up Last week Miss Amy introduced
[2899.26 --> 2903.26]  Miss Amy introduced a new verse that we're focused on for a couple of Sundays
[2903.26 --> 2909.26]  You guys remember what verse that is We only just started working on the memory verse
[2909.26 --> 2910.26]  Shall I read it again?
[2910.26 --> 2913.26]  It's from 1 Timothy
[2913.26 --> 2916.26]  We're learning about Timothy and it's 1 Timothy 4
[2916.26 --> 2919.26]  It's one that probably a lot of us in the room know
[2919.26 --> 2921.26]  Oh boy
[2921.26 --> 2925.26]  Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young
[2925.26 --> 2931.26]  But set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith, and in purity
[2931.26 --> 2934.26]  So last week you guys remember what it was that we learned about?
[2934.26 --> 2937.26]  What's a good way to set an example even though we're really young?
[2937.26 --> 2939.26]  It was?
[2939.26 --> 2942.26]  Yeah, we can pray for anyone
[2942.26 --> 2944.26]  Even though we're young we can pray for anyone, right?
[2944.26 --> 2946.26]  That was last week's lesson
[2946.26 --> 2951.26]  So this week we're gonna switch a little bit over to a different topic
[2951.26 --> 2954.26]  And that is being leaders
[2954.26 --> 2957.26]  Oh boy, that sounds like a big topic
[2957.26 --> 2958.26]  So let me ask you something
[2958.26 --> 2959.26]  Is there...
[2959.26 --> 2962.26]  I can think of a game that's sort of like being a leader
[2962.26 --> 2965.26]  It's called Simon Says
[2965.26 --> 2967.26]  Do you guys know how that game works?
[2967.26 --> 2969.26]  Yeah? How does it work?
[2969.26 --> 2971.26]  What is Simon Says?
[2971.26 --> 2973.26]  I can't do a lot of things
[2973.26 --> 2974.26]  I can't do a lot of things
[2974.26 --> 2976.26]  Oh, yeah, so there's all these rules
[2976.26 --> 2977.26]  If Simon Says you do it
[2977.26 --> 2978.26]  And if he doesn't
[2978.26 --> 2980.26]  If you don't say Simon Says
[2980.26 --> 2981.26]  And then you're out
[2981.26 --> 2982.26]  Yikes
[2982.26 --> 2984.26]  Well guess what I was thinking about this
[2984.26 --> 2985.26]  As an example
[2985.26 --> 2987.26]  Like oh maybe we should play this game
[2987.26 --> 2989.26]  Maybe we should play it up in front of the church
[2989.26 --> 2993.26]  Maybe we should make the whole congregation play Simon Says with us
[2993.26 --> 2994.26]  No
[2994.26 --> 2996.26]  But then I thought actually
[2996.26 --> 3000.26]  Simon Says isn't really on point with what we're talking about
[3000.26 --> 3002.26]  As being examples of being leaders
[3002.26 --> 3004.26]  Because Simon Says it's a fun game
[3004.26 --> 3007.26]  But it's maybe a little bit bossy
[3007.26 --> 3008.26]  Right?
[3008.26 --> 3011.26]  Like as a leader you just tell everybody what to do
[3011.26 --> 3013.26]  And then if they don't do it right
[3013.26 --> 3014.26]  Or you don't do it right
[3014.26 --> 3015.26]  You're out
[3015.26 --> 3016.26]  I don't know
[3016.26 --> 3018.26]  I don't think that's quite what we're focused on
[3018.26 --> 3020.26]  With this Bible verse
[3020.26 --> 3021.26]  Right?
[3021.26 --> 3022.26]  We can still play that game
[3022.26 --> 3025.26]  But that's not quite the example we're gonna talk about today
[3025.26 --> 3026.26]  In children's worship time
[3026.26 --> 3028.26]  We do have another game though
[3028.26 --> 3030.26]  That we're gonna play in children's worship time
[3030.26 --> 3032.26]  To try and kind of learn the lesson a little bit more
[3032.26 --> 3035.26]  But how about we bless the congregation
[3035.26 --> 3037.26]  Before we head out
[3037.26 --> 3039.26]  And they I think will probably bless us in return
[3039.26 --> 3040.26]  So let's stand together
[3043.26 --> 3044.26]  Alright
[3044.26 --> 3045.26]  With our arms up
[3045.26 --> 3048.26]  The Lord be with you
[3048.26 --> 3050.26]  And also with you
[3050.26 --> 3051.26]  Good morning my name is Clary
[3051.26 --> 3052.26]  I'm an elder here at Emmanuel
[3052.26 --> 3053.26]  We had a
[3053.26 --> 3054.26]  Elder's council meeting this week
[3054.26 --> 3055.26]  And I just wanted to talk about this
[3055.26 --> 3056.26]  And I just wanted to show you
[3056.26 --> 3057.76]  I'd like to ask you
[3057.76 --> 3060.26]  good morning my name is Clary
[3060.26 --> 3063.26]  I'm an elder here at Emmanuel
[3063.26 --> 3082.26]  Good morning, my name is Clary. I'm an elder here at Emanuel. We had an elders council
[3082.26 --> 3087.82]  meeting this week and I just want to give you just an update of what we talked about.
[3087.82 --> 3095.70]  We reviewed the minutes of the spring AGM. We reviewed and accepted the retirement notice
[3095.70 --> 3104.44]  from our church custodian of Grace VanderDean effective August 29, 2025. We discussed the
[3104.44 --> 3111.88]  process of calling Kevin Lobert and we discussed if another town hall should be held. Council
[3111.88 --> 3119.60]  agreed that another town hall meeting to discuss Kevin's calling would not be scheduled. Council
[3119.60 --> 3126.48]  strongly encourages members to contact their elder if they wish to provide further feedback
[3126.48 --> 3134.62]  or have questions. Council is hoping to schedule a meeting in mid-September to formally put forward
[3134.62 --> 3141.92]  to the congregation a vote to call Kevin. And finally, we received an update from Pastor
[3141.92 --> 3153.62]  Chris and Pastor Kevin. It was noted that Pastor Kevin is now eligible for call in the CRC.
[3153.62 --> 3174.50]  Council is now eligible for call in the CRC. I'm Eric, an elder here at Emanuel, and I'll
[3174.50 --> 3183.60]  lead you in our church family prayer. Lord Jesus, we come in our family church prayer.
[3183.60 --> 3190.78]  to praise you. Clap your hands, all you nations. Shout to the Lord with cries of joy. For the Lord
[3190.78 --> 3196.84]  most high is awesome and the great over all the earth. May God be gracious to us and bless us.
[3197.06 --> 3202.90]  Make us face shine upon us so that your ways be known on earth, your salvation among the nations.
[3204.04 --> 3209.96]  May the people praise you, God. May all the people praise you. This week, we praise you for the
[3209.96 --> 3217.18]  marriage of Jenna Spoor and Lake Borasset. This past Friday, they were blessed in their marriage.
[3217.42 --> 3222.38]  May you bless them with love and grace. May they both be deepened in their faith with you
[3222.38 --> 3225.38]  as they begin their next chapter of life as a married couple.
[3225.38 --> 3232.64]  May the people bless you. This is the time of year where most of our students, whether completing
[3232.64 --> 3239.52]  their studies now or next week, some of us is graduation, whether from elementary, grade four,
[3240.02 --> 3246.38]  high school, or even college and university. These are new stages and can be sometimes overwhelming.
[3246.56 --> 3251.84]  Bless all the students in this summer in all their work, their holidays, and their life planning.
[3252.60 --> 3256.06]  Show them that your way, Lord, teach them your path.
[3257.28 --> 3260.76]  Synod affirmed the ministry for Kevin, for the ministry of the word,
[3260.76 --> 3266.56]  and we thank you and praise you for that opportunity for Kevin to preach and worship amongst us.
[3267.24 --> 3271.62]  We also think of Tanya Tessemaker as she continues to deal with her cancer in hospice.
[3271.76 --> 3276.14]  We pray for peace and strength for her and her whole family during this difficult time.
[3276.96 --> 3281.04]  We also think of Doug and Tessa as they also continue to deal with fighting of cancer.
[3281.04 --> 3287.38]  May you comfort everyone on their journey and pray for healing and comfort, Lord.
[3288.76 --> 3292.26]  Lord, at this time we also think of the changes the church has gone through
[3292.26 --> 3297.98]  with Grace having served here for many years here, Lord, in her retirement,
[3298.16 --> 3302.66]  and we think of also the elders and deacons that have changed over in the last month.
[3302.78 --> 3307.66]  May you bless the newcomers and the outgoing people, Lord, and bless them in their journey.
[3307.66 --> 3315.54]  Lord, we bless you as we go through our week and keep us grounded and rooted in your word.
[3315.94 --> 3317.86]  In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[3317.86 --> 3317.98]  Amen.
[3317.98 --> 3339.18]  I want to encourage you to grab a Bible or open up the Bible that you have with you.
[3339.18 --> 3346.56]  And we're going to finish the second letter to the Thessalonians today
[3346.56 --> 3354.28]  and then finish our series looking at these two letters together.
[3354.44 --> 3359.56]  And so we're going to read from 2 Thessalonians 3 starting at verse 6
[3359.56 --> 3362.46]  and we'll read through to the end.
[3362.46 --> 3367.46]  If you would like a Bible, you can grab some from the back if you don't have one with you
[3367.46 --> 3369.38]  or on a device for you there.
[3371.50 --> 3373.14]  Let's read this together.
[3375.66 --> 3380.50]  In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we command you, brothers and sisters,
[3380.50 --> 3385.60]  to keep away from every believer who is idle and disruptive
[3385.60 --> 3389.54]  and does not live according to the teaching you received from us.
[3389.54 --> 3395.38]  For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example.
[3396.68 --> 3399.26]  We were not idle when we were with you,
[3399.64 --> 3402.56]  nor did we eat anyone's food without paying for it.
[3402.96 --> 3406.40]  On the contrary, we worked night and day, laboring and toiling,
[3406.58 --> 3408.84]  so that we would not be a burden to any of you.
[3409.86 --> 3414.28]  We did this not because we do not have the right to such help,
[3414.32 --> 3417.80]  but in order to offer ourselves as a model for you to imitate.
[3417.80 --> 3422.18]  For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule,
[3422.72 --> 3425.62]  the one who is unwilling to work shall not eat.
[3426.92 --> 3430.48]  We hear that some among you are idle and disruptive.
[3431.24 --> 3433.76]  They are not busy, they are busy bodies.
[3435.12 --> 3438.20]  Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ
[3438.20 --> 3440.78]  to settle down and earn the food they eat.
[3440.78 --> 3445.84]  And as for you, brothers and sisters, never tire of doing what is good.
[3447.38 --> 3452.22]  Take special note of anyone who does not obey our instruction in this letter.
[3453.50 --> 3456.88]  Do not associate with them in order that they may feel ashamed.
[3457.72 --> 3462.60]  Yet do not regard them as an enemy, but warn them as you would a fellow believer.
[3462.60 --> 3471.20]  And now, may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way.
[3471.92 --> 3474.00]  The Lord be with all of you.
[3475.14 --> 3477.80]  I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand,
[3478.08 --> 3480.52]  which is the distinguishing mark in all my letters.
[3480.70 --> 3481.90]  This is how I write.
[3482.50 --> 3486.04]  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
[3486.72 --> 3487.82]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3487.82 --> 3501.56]  It seems to me that we live in a culture that is kind of caught between two poles.
[3502.42 --> 3506.38]  On the one hand is the pull of productivity,
[3507.12 --> 3511.20]  and on the other is the value of rest and healthy boundaries.
[3512.66 --> 3515.62]  On the one hand, we want to be generous,
[3515.62 --> 3518.66]  but we also fear being played.
[3520.44 --> 3522.20]  Right, on one side, we're told to hustle,
[3522.58 --> 3525.50]  to grind, to build, to perform, to produce,
[3526.04 --> 3530.78]  and to make something of ourselves.
[3531.56 --> 3533.76]  Productivity becomes not just a virtue,
[3534.18 --> 3535.50]  but a source of identity.
[3536.38 --> 3537.94]  You are what you accomplish.
[3538.90 --> 3540.88]  Rest is something you earn,
[3540.88 --> 3543.24]  but only after you've proven your worth.
[3543.24 --> 3546.48]  And the result for many of us
[3546.48 --> 3548.30]  is that we are exhausted
[3548.30 --> 3552.56]  physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
[3554.40 --> 3555.74]  And on the other side,
[3555.98 --> 3558.80]  there's a deep and growing cynicism
[3558.80 --> 3563.14]  that permeates towards need and those in need.
[3563.70 --> 3565.28]  Right, we've seen too many headlines
[3565.28 --> 3567.42]  about people gaming the system,
[3567.72 --> 3568.88]  too many stories,
[3568.98 --> 3569.80]  some of them true,
[3569.90 --> 3571.16]  but honestly, most of them not,
[3571.16 --> 3574.42]  about fraud or laziness or entitlement.
[3575.68 --> 3577.28]  And so, what happens, right,
[3577.32 --> 3578.80]  is we tighten our fists,
[3579.08 --> 3579.98]  we get suspicious,
[3580.46 --> 3581.58]  and we start asking,
[3581.82 --> 3583.20]  are they really even trying?
[3584.32 --> 3585.58]  The implication being,
[3585.94 --> 3587.02]  do they deserve my help?
[3588.16 --> 3590.94]  And we put up these emotional and relational walls
[3590.94 --> 3592.62]  to protect ourselves
[3592.62 --> 3595.10]  from being taken advantage of,
[3595.12 --> 3596.24]  or at least feeling like
[3596.24 --> 3597.64]  we're being taken advantage of.
[3597.64 --> 3600.46]  And in the middle of all of this,
[3600.80 --> 3602.12]  we try to,
[3602.22 --> 3603.80]  or at least we say we want to,
[3603.96 --> 3605.00]  live generously,
[3606.10 --> 3607.76]  but we keep the receipts.
[3609.34 --> 3613.28]  We track whether people are doing their part,
[3614.14 --> 3615.76]  or are they doing the right thing
[3615.76 --> 3618.16]  with the generosity that I have given them.
[3619.32 --> 3620.88]  We start drawing lines,
[3621.02 --> 3622.52]  consciously or unconsciously,
[3622.74 --> 3625.52]  between the worthy and the unworthy.
[3625.52 --> 3627.84]  And then again,
[3627.96 --> 3628.30]  eventually,
[3628.50 --> 3629.96]  we start to feel the weight
[3629.96 --> 3630.94]  of our own effort,
[3631.90 --> 3634.00]  of getting tired,
[3634.40 --> 3636.98]  and we get tired
[3636.98 --> 3638.50]  of doing good
[3638.50 --> 3640.00]  when it feels like
[3640.00 --> 3641.54]  no one else is trying to do the same.
[3643.28 --> 3644.52]  And so we pull back.
[3646.22 --> 3647.48]  Not because we're selfish,
[3648.32 --> 3650.26]  but because we're disillusioned.
[3650.26 --> 3653.00]  And the problem,
[3653.14 --> 3653.46]  of course,
[3653.56 --> 3653.70]  right,
[3653.72 --> 3656.16]  is that neither one of these approaches works.
[3656.68 --> 3658.78]  Hustle can't satisfy the soul,
[3658.94 --> 3660.04]  it only burns you out.
[3661.16 --> 3663.30]  And cynicism doesn't protect you,
[3663.38 --> 3664.98]  it just isolates you
[3664.98 --> 3666.02]  and makes you cold.
[3667.70 --> 3671.62]  We try to manage the risks of generosity,
[3671.96 --> 3672.96]  but in doing so,
[3673.06 --> 3674.60]  we lose the joy of grace.
[3674.60 --> 3677.56]  We try to create fairness,
[3677.88 --> 3679.04]  but what ends up happening
[3679.04 --> 3680.40]  is we forfeit mercy.
[3682.64 --> 3683.94]  We need a better way.
[3684.90 --> 3687.06]  A way that takes work
[3687.06 --> 3689.06]  and working seriously
[3689.06 --> 3690.82]  without turning it into an idol.
[3691.98 --> 3694.18]  And a way that embraces generosity
[3694.18 --> 3695.36]  without being naive.
[3696.04 --> 3698.12]  And a way that holds people accountable
[3698.12 --> 3699.92]  without giving up on them.
[3699.92 --> 3705.24]  In a community shaped by grace,
[3705.92 --> 3707.34]  what we will see here
[3707.34 --> 3709.50]  in this last chapter
[3709.50 --> 3711.76]  is that work is a gift,
[3712.64 --> 3714.68]  that generosity is a calling,
[3715.06 --> 3715.90]  and that accountability
[3715.90 --> 3717.76]  is an act of love.
[3719.04 --> 3720.58]  That's our big idea this morning,
[3720.66 --> 3722.50]  that in a community shaped by grace,
[3722.72 --> 3723.70]  work is a gift,
[3724.14 --> 3725.54]  generosity is a calling,
[3725.92 --> 3728.26]  and accountability is an act of love.
[3728.26 --> 3731.04]  That is exactly what Paul is offering here
[3731.04 --> 3733.42]  in 2 Thessalonians 3.
[3734.90 --> 3736.54]  This chapter confronts
[3736.54 --> 3738.50]  both of these ditches.
[3738.72 --> 3739.50]  On the one hand,
[3739.58 --> 3740.62]  the pull of productivity,
[3740.92 --> 3741.36]  and on the other,
[3741.44 --> 3743.26]  the fear of being played.
[3743.38 --> 3746.26]  This chapter doesn't glorify busyness
[3746.26 --> 3748.36]  like our culture tends to do,
[3748.64 --> 3752.30]  but it calls us to a quiet faithfulness.
[3753.48 --> 3755.44]  It doesn't excuse idleness,
[3755.44 --> 3756.86]  but it roots discipline
[3756.86 --> 3759.48]  in a community of mutual love.
[3760.34 --> 3762.22]  And it doesn't shame generosity,
[3762.70 --> 3764.08]  it calls for wisdom
[3764.08 --> 3765.98]  without cynicism.
[3767.64 --> 3769.18]  Now at the off here,
[3769.28 --> 3770.70]  it's worth noting
[3770.70 --> 3772.54]  that Paul,
[3773.28 --> 3775.40]  in this second letter especially,
[3775.90 --> 3777.78]  spends just as much time
[3777.78 --> 3778.96]  warning Christians
[3778.96 --> 3780.36]  who are idle
[3780.36 --> 3781.58]  as he does
[3781.58 --> 3783.80]  talking about the second coming of Jesus.
[3783.80 --> 3786.80]  I want you to note that.
[3787.78 --> 3788.00]  Right?
[3788.04 --> 3789.58]  This is no small matter
[3789.58 --> 3790.54]  to be dismissed.
[3792.82 --> 3794.38]  And you probably heard it
[3794.38 --> 3795.70]  when we read through it,
[3795.80 --> 3798.18]  he uses pretty strong language here.
[3799.18 --> 3799.66]  Right?
[3799.68 --> 3800.72]  He's not just warning
[3800.72 --> 3801.80]  those who are idle
[3801.80 --> 3802.50]  and disruptive
[3802.50 --> 3804.16]  to stop being idle,
[3804.44 --> 3806.28]  he's telling other Christians
[3806.28 --> 3808.00]  to keep away from them.
[3808.00 --> 3812.06]  Now,
[3812.84 --> 3815.20]  part of the response
[3815.20 --> 3817.92]  that Paul is seeming to address here
[3817.92 --> 3819.20]  is that there are people
[3819.20 --> 3820.12]  in the community
[3820.12 --> 3821.56]  who are being idle
[3821.56 --> 3823.54]  and they connect that
[3823.54 --> 3824.52]  to the idea
[3824.52 --> 3826.12]  that they were apparently
[3826.12 --> 3829.76]  anticipating Jesus' return
[3829.76 --> 3830.78]  imminently,
[3831.06 --> 3832.54]  like that he would come quickly.
[3832.92 --> 3834.10]  And so because he would
[3834.10 --> 3835.48]  come back quickly,
[3835.48 --> 3837.30]  maybe they quit their jobs
[3837.30 --> 3838.28]  or something like that
[3838.28 --> 3839.64]  or they just stopped providing
[3839.64 --> 3840.88]  for themselves
[3840.88 --> 3843.22]  when they could have continued
[3843.22 --> 3844.06]  because they thought,
[3844.18 --> 3844.90]  well, it's all going to end
[3844.90 --> 3846.50]  in a moment's notice anyway.
[3848.20 --> 3848.72]  Now,
[3849.48 --> 3850.84]  if you've been around
[3850.84 --> 3852.06]  a church
[3852.06 --> 3853.30]  for a period of time
[3853.30 --> 3854.34]  or you've looked into
[3854.34 --> 3855.66]  the early church
[3855.66 --> 3856.16]  and the makeup
[3856.16 --> 3857.20]  of the early church,
[3857.80 --> 3858.56]  we know
[3858.56 --> 3859.88]  that the early church
[3859.88 --> 3861.34]  shared their possessions
[3861.34 --> 3861.96]  in common.
[3862.56 --> 3863.14]  We know
[3863.14 --> 3864.38]  that they would sell things
[3864.38 --> 3865.38]  in order to provide
[3865.38 --> 3866.36]  for the needs of others.
[3866.66 --> 3867.20]  We know
[3867.20 --> 3868.88]  that the early leadership
[3868.88 --> 3869.72]  of the church
[3869.72 --> 3871.24]  established elders
[3871.24 --> 3872.44]  and deacons
[3872.44 --> 3873.56]  in order that
[3873.56 --> 3874.82]  the ministry of the word
[3874.82 --> 3875.98]  might not be neglected
[3875.98 --> 3877.30]  and to ensure
[3877.30 --> 3878.80]  that those on the margins
[3878.80 --> 3879.80]  would be cared for.
[3880.88 --> 3881.70]  The church
[3881.70 --> 3882.84]  was a community
[3882.84 --> 3884.74]  and is a community
[3884.74 --> 3886.44]  that cares for one another.
[3888.68 --> 3891.12]  And whenever you are willing
[3891.12 --> 3892.88]  to care for one another,
[3892.88 --> 3894.72]  whenever you are willing
[3894.72 --> 3895.66]  to sacrifice
[3895.66 --> 3897.32]  your own well-being
[3897.32 --> 3898.16]  for the well-being
[3898.16 --> 3899.28]  of those around you,
[3899.64 --> 3901.14]  you run the risk
[3901.14 --> 3903.00]  of being taken advantage of.
[3905.34 --> 3906.62]  And in a community
[3906.62 --> 3907.70]  where grace abounds,
[3907.90 --> 3909.44]  I think that's a risk
[3909.44 --> 3910.24]  that we must
[3910.24 --> 3911.44]  willingly take.
[3912.58 --> 3912.98]  Right?
[3913.04 --> 3914.44]  The church's generosity,
[3915.00 --> 3916.22]  the diaconal ministry
[3916.22 --> 3917.02]  of the church,
[3917.02 --> 3919.82]  the church's benevolence
[3919.82 --> 3921.06]  must be
[3921.06 --> 3922.86]  incredible to behold.
[3923.00 --> 3924.16]  It must be prodigious
[3924.16 --> 3925.16]  and liberal
[3925.16 --> 3926.18]  and amazing
[3926.18 --> 3927.04]  for all to see.
[3928.00 --> 3929.38]  And when that happens,
[3930.34 --> 3931.88]  you might get suckered.
[3934.00 --> 3935.40]  There's actually a story
[3935.40 --> 3936.50]  from the early church.
[3937.38 --> 3938.44]  I've shared this
[3938.44 --> 3939.70]  in other contexts before
[3939.70 --> 3941.96]  that brings this tension
[3941.96 --> 3942.58]  to life.
[3942.58 --> 3945.70]  Lucian of Samosata,
[3946.08 --> 3947.78]  who's a Greek satirist
[3947.78 --> 3948.56]  and he's writing
[3948.56 --> 3949.54]  nearing the end
[3949.54 --> 3950.70]  of the second century,
[3951.44 --> 3952.58]  he tells the story
[3952.58 --> 3954.46]  of a man named
[3954.46 --> 3955.78]  Peregrinus.
[3956.70 --> 3957.56]  And now this story,
[3957.70 --> 3958.16]  it's debated
[3958.16 --> 3959.24]  if this is
[3959.24 --> 3960.56]  a historical account
[3960.56 --> 3962.60]  or it's a satirical account,
[3963.08 --> 3964.24]  but it's offered
[3964.24 --> 3965.82]  to make this compelling point.
[3967.52 --> 3968.16]  Peregrinus,
[3968.38 --> 3969.58]  Lucian says,
[3969.92 --> 3971.34]  faked a conversion
[3971.34 --> 3972.32]  to Christianity
[3972.32 --> 3974.02]  in order to gain
[3974.02 --> 3975.16]  influence
[3975.16 --> 3976.24]  in certain
[3976.24 --> 3977.44]  Christian circles.
[3978.48 --> 3979.62]  And at one point,
[3979.96 --> 3981.66]  Peregrinus is arrested
[3981.66 --> 3983.32]  and the local Christians,
[3983.64 --> 3984.56]  thinking that he might
[3984.56 --> 3985.30]  be martyred,
[3985.68 --> 3986.78]  start to bring him food.
[3987.50 --> 3988.44]  They start to bring him money.
[3988.80 --> 3990.68]  They even try to bribe
[3990.68 --> 3991.38]  the guards
[3991.38 --> 3992.06]  in order to make
[3992.06 --> 3993.72]  his prison stay easier.
[3994.78 --> 3995.58]  But eventually,
[3995.72 --> 3996.86]  the governor of the region
[3996.86 --> 3997.80]  releases him
[3997.80 --> 3998.64]  because he doesn't want
[3998.64 --> 3999.50]  to make him a martyr
[3999.50 --> 4001.18]  and Peregrinus
[4001.18 --> 4002.60]  goes to travel
[4002.60 --> 4003.46]  the empire,
[4004.02 --> 4004.68]  living off
[4004.68 --> 4005.86]  Christian hospitality,
[4006.54 --> 4007.78]  telling this story.
[4009.60 --> 4011.12]  The way that Lucian
[4011.12 --> 4011.90]  writes it,
[4011.98 --> 4012.82]  he sneers
[4012.82 --> 4014.12]  at the church's compassion.
[4014.66 --> 4015.30]  He says,
[4015.34 --> 4016.24]  and I'm going to quote here,
[4016.78 --> 4017.38]  he says,
[4017.48 --> 4017.94]  essentially,
[4018.32 --> 4019.32]  these people
[4019.32 --> 4021.06]  believe they're all brothers,
[4021.64 --> 4022.40]  so that's Christians,
[4023.48 --> 4024.30]  and that all things
[4024.30 --> 4025.22]  are held in common,
[4025.22 --> 4027.38]  so if a clever trickster
[4027.38 --> 4028.24]  comes along,
[4028.38 --> 4029.38]  he can get rich
[4029.38 --> 4030.74]  off of their simplicity.
[4032.48 --> 4033.04]  In short,
[4033.70 --> 4034.54]  these are a gullible
[4034.54 --> 4035.30]  bunch of people,
[4035.62 --> 4036.72]  take advantage of them,
[4036.78 --> 4037.72]  and get all their money.
[4039.34 --> 4039.90]  And whether or not
[4039.90 --> 4040.56]  it's true,
[4041.32 --> 4043.10]  Lucian is recounting
[4043.10 --> 4045.04]  a story of what Paul saw,
[4045.20 --> 4045.38]  right?
[4045.48 --> 4047.20]  Where grace flows
[4047.20 --> 4048.62]  freely and readily,
[4049.18 --> 4050.14]  someone will try
[4050.14 --> 4050.98]  to exploit it.
[4050.98 --> 4053.04]  And yet,
[4053.46 --> 4054.92]  Paul doesn't shut down
[4054.92 --> 4056.12]  that flowing of grace.
[4056.44 --> 4057.10]  He doesn't say,
[4057.50 --> 4058.26]  stop being generous.
[4058.76 --> 4059.08]  Instead,
[4059.24 --> 4059.60]  effectively,
[4059.76 --> 4060.08]  he says,
[4060.42 --> 4061.08]  be wise.
[4063.00 --> 4064.36]  I think the point here
[4064.36 --> 4064.76]  is that,
[4064.80 --> 4064.90]  yeah,
[4065.02 --> 4066.16]  you might get suckered,
[4066.78 --> 4067.94]  but don't be a sucker.
[4068.94 --> 4069.82]  Do you notice the difference?
[4070.84 --> 4072.04]  Jesus will say
[4072.04 --> 4072.80]  in Matthew 10,
[4073.44 --> 4073.70]  he says,
[4073.82 --> 4075.00]  I am sending you out
[4075.00 --> 4076.82]  like sheep among wolves.
[4077.40 --> 4077.74]  Therefore,
[4078.14 --> 4079.10]  be as shrewd
[4079.10 --> 4079.82]  as snakes
[4079.82 --> 4081.34]  and as innocent
[4081.34 --> 4082.16]  as doves.
[4083.48 --> 4084.42]  I think this is
[4084.42 --> 4085.50]  the same kind of idea.
[4086.46 --> 4086.64]  Yeah,
[4086.72 --> 4087.68]  you might get taken
[4087.68 --> 4088.54]  advantage of.
[4088.72 --> 4089.64]  That comes with
[4089.64 --> 4090.48]  the territory,
[4091.06 --> 4092.34]  but notice,
[4093.10 --> 4093.40]  right,
[4093.44 --> 4094.28]  there's an important thing
[4094.28 --> 4095.08]  that's going on
[4095.08 --> 4097.00]  in this text.
[4098.78 --> 4100.34]  Paul says here
[4100.34 --> 4101.66]  to keep away
[4101.66 --> 4103.64]  from every believer
[4103.64 --> 4104.88]  who is idle.
[4105.58 --> 4106.32]  He says,
[4106.42 --> 4107.72]  we hear that some of you,
[4108.26 --> 4109.04]  and he's writing
[4109.04 --> 4109.72]  to the church,
[4109.82 --> 4110.68]  our idol.
[4111.44 --> 4112.72]  He has this memorable line
[4112.72 --> 4113.04]  that says,
[4113.16 --> 4114.08]  they're not busy,
[4114.22 --> 4115.20]  they're busy bodies,
[4115.54 --> 4116.78]  and then in verse 15,
[4116.88 --> 4117.20]  he says,
[4117.42 --> 4118.06]  don't regard them
[4118.06 --> 4118.80]  as an enemy,
[4119.06 --> 4119.88]  but warn them
[4119.88 --> 4120.68]  as you would
[4120.68 --> 4122.22]  a fellow believer.
[4123.56 --> 4124.36]  The point is,
[4124.46 --> 4125.28]  Paul is talking
[4125.28 --> 4125.96]  to people
[4125.96 --> 4126.58]  who identify
[4126.58 --> 4127.56]  as Christian,
[4127.66 --> 4128.54]  who are part
[4128.54 --> 4129.38]  of the system
[4129.38 --> 4130.80]  of the emerging church
[4130.80 --> 4132.36]  of the Thessalonians.
[4133.74 --> 4135.30]  His hard word here
[4135.30 --> 4136.40]  is for brothers
[4136.40 --> 4137.06]  and sisters.
[4137.96 --> 4138.54]  He's talking
[4138.54 --> 4139.50]  about insiders,
[4139.60 --> 4140.04]  he's talking
[4140.04 --> 4141.06]  to insiders
[4141.06 --> 4142.32]  about insiders.
[4143.46 --> 4144.66]  He says in verse 10,
[4145.80 --> 4146.82]  they have this rule
[4146.82 --> 4147.36]  that if you're not
[4147.36 --> 4148.10]  willing to work,
[4148.18 --> 4148.96]  you shall not eat.
[4149.80 --> 4150.68]  And he urges them
[4150.68 --> 4151.74]  to settle down
[4151.74 --> 4153.12]  and earn the food
[4153.12 --> 4153.74]  that they eat.
[4154.42 --> 4155.02]  Now, it's interesting
[4155.02 --> 4156.44]  that, at least to me,
[4156.54 --> 4157.16]  someone who enjoys
[4157.16 --> 4157.68]  these things,
[4158.04 --> 4159.40]  that word pair
[4159.40 --> 4160.52]  that's translated
[4160.52 --> 4161.50]  settle down
[4161.50 --> 4163.42]  means work
[4163.42 --> 4164.32]  a quiet life.
[4165.56 --> 4166.58]  It's an echo
[4166.58 --> 4167.86]  of an earlier call
[4167.86 --> 4168.88]  that we saw
[4168.88 --> 4170.18]  back in the first letter.
[4170.60 --> 4172.00]  In 1 Thessalonians 4,
[4172.64 --> 4173.68]  Paul writes,
[4173.80 --> 4174.78]  make it your ambition
[4174.78 --> 4176.48]  to lead a quiet life.
[4176.88 --> 4177.42]  You should mind
[4177.42 --> 4178.04]  your own business
[4178.04 --> 4179.02]  and work with your hands
[4179.02 --> 4179.94]  so that you will not
[4179.94 --> 4181.16]  be dependent on anybody.
[4182.26 --> 4183.38]  In another place,
[4183.48 --> 4183.96]  in Timothy,
[4184.24 --> 4185.92]  Paul reminds Timothy
[4185.92 --> 4192.78]  to pray for those
[4192.78 --> 4193.40]  in authority
[4193.40 --> 4194.74]  that Christians
[4194.74 --> 4195.42]  might be able
[4195.42 --> 4196.84]  to live peaceful
[4196.84 --> 4198.36]  and quiet lives
[4198.36 --> 4199.80]  in godliness
[4199.80 --> 4200.76]  and holiness.
[4201.84 --> 4202.48]  Similarly,
[4202.64 --> 4203.52]  he urges Titus
[4203.52 --> 4204.52]  that our people
[4204.52 --> 4205.12]  must learn
[4205.12 --> 4206.10]  to devote themselves
[4206.10 --> 4207.36]  to doing what is good
[4207.36 --> 4208.42]  and not live
[4208.42 --> 4210.02]  unproductive lives.
[4210.92 --> 4211.84]  And it seems
[4211.84 --> 4212.74]  pretty clear
[4212.74 --> 4213.32]  that behind
[4213.32 --> 4214.68]  all of this idea
[4214.68 --> 4216.84]  is a contrast
[4216.84 --> 4218.54]  that runs out
[4218.54 --> 4220.04]  of the wisdom literature
[4220.04 --> 4221.46]  of the Old Testament.
[4221.62 --> 4223.42]  That deep in the wisdom
[4223.42 --> 4224.90]  of the book of Proverbs,
[4225.10 --> 4226.78]  there's a clear contrast
[4226.78 --> 4228.82]  between being diligent
[4228.82 --> 4230.72]  and being lazy.
[4230.94 --> 4231.36]  And the one
[4231.36 --> 4232.78]  who works steadily
[4232.78 --> 4234.10]  and plans ahead
[4234.10 --> 4235.30]  is considered wise,
[4235.64 --> 4236.16]  while the one
[4236.16 --> 4237.32]  who refuses to work
[4237.32 --> 4238.48]  and who delays action
[4238.48 --> 4239.10]  is portrayed
[4239.10 --> 4240.00]  as the fool.
[4241.48 --> 4242.16]  In short,
[4242.50 --> 4243.20]  the biblical principle
[4243.20 --> 4244.16]  is that hard work
[4244.16 --> 4245.02]  is wisdom
[4245.02 --> 4246.28]  and idleness
[4246.28 --> 4247.56]  is folly.
[4249.26 --> 4250.08]  And so for our time
[4250.08 --> 4250.72]  that remains,
[4251.46 --> 4252.38]  I want to spend
[4252.38 --> 4253.80]  just a few minutes
[4253.80 --> 4255.36]  pulling out
[4255.36 --> 4256.34]  a few principles
[4256.34 --> 4257.80]  for application
[4257.80 --> 4259.72]  as a sort of beginning
[4259.72 --> 4261.02]  of a theology
[4261.02 --> 4261.70]  of work
[4261.70 --> 4262.90]  for us.
[4265.70 --> 4266.82]  Now it's interesting
[4266.82 --> 4267.38]  to me
[4267.38 --> 4269.14]  that in verse 6,
[4269.86 --> 4271.14]  Paul says
[4271.14 --> 4271.64]  that we need
[4271.64 --> 4272.22]  to warn
[4272.22 --> 4273.38]  every believer
[4273.38 --> 4274.20]  who is idle
[4274.20 --> 4275.02]  and disruptive,
[4275.56 --> 4276.22]  who does not live
[4276.22 --> 4277.76]  according to the teaching
[4277.76 --> 4278.92]  that you have received
[4278.92 --> 4279.58]  from us.
[4280.44 --> 4281.48]  Maybe the Bible
[4281.48 --> 4282.00]  you're reading
[4282.00 --> 4283.40]  has a footnote there
[4283.40 --> 4284.86]  and if you go down
[4284.86 --> 4285.92]  it says traditions
[4285.92 --> 4287.08]  or tradition
[4287.08 --> 4288.22]  in the place
[4288.22 --> 4289.44]  of the word teaching.
[4290.12 --> 4291.14]  I would suggest
[4291.14 --> 4291.86]  that a more accurate
[4291.86 --> 4293.10]  translation of that word
[4293.10 --> 4294.90]  is actually tradition.
[4294.90 --> 4295.36]  tradition
[4295.36 --> 4299.02]  is the lived
[4299.02 --> 4299.82]  teaching.
[4301.16 --> 4301.72]  Tradition
[4301.72 --> 4302.60]  is teaching
[4302.60 --> 4303.94]  put into practice.
[4305.08 --> 4305.66]  And I think
[4305.66 --> 4306.66]  the point here
[4306.66 --> 4307.78]  is that it's not
[4307.78 --> 4308.62]  just words
[4308.62 --> 4309.18]  that have been
[4309.18 --> 4309.92]  handed down,
[4310.04 --> 4311.04]  not just commands,
[4311.36 --> 4312.36]  but it's the lived
[4312.36 --> 4313.48]  expression of that.
[4315.08 --> 4316.34]  And so we know
[4316.34 --> 4316.94]  that faith
[4316.94 --> 4317.84]  comes from hearing
[4317.84 --> 4318.46]  the gospel.
[4318.92 --> 4319.68]  Faith comes from
[4319.68 --> 4321.04]  believing that Jesus Christ
[4321.04 --> 4321.72]  lived the life
[4321.72 --> 4322.44]  I should have lived
[4322.44 --> 4323.50]  and died the death
[4323.50 --> 4324.18]  that I deserved.
[4324.36 --> 4325.18]  We know that that
[4325.18 --> 4326.28]  is the kind of faith
[4326.28 --> 4327.52]  that saves
[4327.52 --> 4328.42]  and that believing
[4328.42 --> 4329.36]  that is all
[4329.36 --> 4330.42]  we have to do.
[4332.28 --> 4333.98]  But the point here
[4333.98 --> 4335.68]  is believing that
[4335.68 --> 4337.06]  changes everything
[4337.06 --> 4337.92]  you do.
[4339.70 --> 4340.28]  And so yes,
[4340.38 --> 4341.84]  by grace through faith
[4341.84 --> 4342.80]  we are saved
[4342.80 --> 4343.80]  and that's all
[4343.80 --> 4345.36]  we have to do
[4345.36 --> 4346.38]  but coming out
[4346.38 --> 4347.80]  of this new reality
[4347.80 --> 4348.44]  for us
[4348.44 --> 4349.92]  everything we do
[4349.92 --> 4351.10]  is transformed.
[4351.10 --> 4353.02]  saying yes
[4353.02 --> 4353.84]  I believe
[4353.84 --> 4354.94]  in the teaching
[4354.94 --> 4356.54]  means accepting
[4356.54 --> 4357.36]  and living
[4357.36 --> 4358.14]  the tradition.
[4359.52 --> 4360.52]  It's the modeled
[4360.52 --> 4361.90]  example of Paul
[4361.90 --> 4362.72]  and of the other
[4362.72 --> 4363.26]  disciples.
[4363.76 --> 4364.76]  It's the lived
[4364.76 --> 4365.44]  expression
[4365.44 --> 4366.98]  of Christians
[4366.98 --> 4368.70]  that as the Bible
[4368.70 --> 4369.46]  affirms
[4369.46 --> 4370.02]  work
[4370.02 --> 4370.98]  is
[4370.98 --> 4371.84]  good.
[4373.28 --> 4374.26]  And as we're
[4374.26 --> 4375.32]  developing a theology
[4375.32 --> 4376.34]  of work
[4376.34 --> 4377.16]  that's the first
[4377.16 --> 4378.02]  principle.
[4378.96 --> 4380.18]  Work is good
[4380.18 --> 4381.28]  and so
[4381.28 --> 4382.30]  work hard.
[4384.06 --> 4385.02]  As Christians
[4385.02 --> 4385.96]  we know that
[4385.96 --> 4387.10]  humanity
[4387.10 --> 4388.12]  fulfills
[4388.12 --> 4389.02]  the creation
[4389.02 --> 4389.84]  mandate
[4389.84 --> 4391.76]  through working
[4391.76 --> 4393.02]  and keeping
[4393.02 --> 4393.96]  what God
[4393.96 --> 4394.76]  has given us.
[4395.64 --> 4396.78]  This is Genesis 1
[4396.78 --> 4397.74]  and Genesis 2
[4397.74 --> 4398.52]  stuff.
[4398.68 --> 4399.80]  And even in this
[4399.80 --> 4400.70]  fallen world
[4400.70 --> 4401.54]  where work
[4401.54 --> 4402.66]  becomes toilsome
[4402.66 --> 4404.18]  it still retains
[4404.82 --> 4405.68]  part of its
[4405.68 --> 4406.00]  goodness.
[4406.00 --> 4406.20]  righteousness.
[4407.20 --> 4408.54]  It is biblical
[4408.54 --> 4409.66]  to work
[4409.66 --> 4410.42]  hard.
[4411.36 --> 4412.66]  In Colossians 3
[4412.66 --> 4413.16]  23
[4413.16 --> 4413.94]  Paul says
[4413.94 --> 4415.58]  whatever you do
[4415.58 --> 4416.60]  work at it
[4416.60 --> 4417.14]  with all your
[4417.14 --> 4417.60]  heart
[4417.60 --> 4418.36]  as working
[4418.36 --> 4419.34]  for the
[4419.34 --> 4419.62]  Lord.
[4421.70 --> 4422.70]  Now practically
[4422.70 --> 4424.02]  I've often
[4424.02 --> 4424.42]  said
[4424.42 --> 4425.60]  that Christian
[4425.60 --> 4426.14]  bosses
[4426.14 --> 4427.00]  should be
[4427.00 --> 4427.46]  the best
[4427.46 --> 4427.86]  bosses
[4427.86 --> 4428.40]  that people
[4428.40 --> 4429.02]  ever have.
[4430.50 --> 4430.72]  Right?
[4430.84 --> 4431.26]  Bosses who
[4431.26 --> 4431.64]  are full
[4431.64 --> 4432.18]  of grace
[4432.18 --> 4433.26]  and encouragement
[4433.26 --> 4434.12]  generous
[4434.12 --> 4434.76]  in your
[4434.76 --> 4435.48]  compensation
[4435.48 --> 4436.34]  of your
[4436.34 --> 4436.92]  employees
[4436.92 --> 4437.34]  generous
[4437.34 --> 4438.20]  with your
[4438.20 --> 4438.64]  time
[4438.64 --> 4439.28]  and availability
[4439.28 --> 4440.12]  for them
[4440.12 --> 4441.76]  but it's
[4441.76 --> 4442.60]  also true
[4442.60 --> 4444.32]  that Christian
[4444.32 --> 4445.18]  employees
[4445.18 --> 4446.84]  should be
[4446.84 --> 4447.48]  among the
[4447.48 --> 4448.00]  most hard
[4448.00 --> 4448.34]  working
[4448.34 --> 4449.10]  and diligent
[4449.10 --> 4450.06]  employees
[4450.06 --> 4451.08]  anyone has
[4451.08 --> 4451.54]  ever had
[4451.54 --> 4453.08]  because we
[4453.08 --> 4453.48]  work for
[4453.48 --> 4453.90]  the Lord.
[4454.62 --> 4455.02]  We work
[4455.02 --> 4455.28]  for the
[4455.28 --> 4456.04]  glory of
[4456.04 --> 4456.36]  God
[4456.36 --> 4456.68]  and for
[4456.68 --> 4456.90]  his
[4456.90 --> 4457.38]  purposes.
[4458.30 --> 4458.74]  Everything
[4458.74 --> 4459.52]  we do
[4459.52 --> 4460.14]  we do
[4460.14 --> 4461.34]  in front
[4461.34 --> 4461.90]  of his
[4461.90 --> 4462.62]  face
[4462.62 --> 4463.10]  as an
[4463.10 --> 4463.68]  act of
[4463.68 --> 4464.34]  worship
[4464.34 --> 4464.86]  for what
[4464.86 --> 4465.50]  he is
[4465.50 --> 4465.76]  doing
[4465.76 --> 4466.10]  in our
[4466.10 --> 4466.38]  midst.
[4467.08 --> 4467.22]  Now
[4467.22 --> 4469.84]  don't hear
[4469.84 --> 4470.14]  what I'm
[4470.14 --> 4470.66]  not saying
[4470.66 --> 4472.48]  because there's
[4472.48 --> 4472.80]  a whole
[4472.80 --> 4473.32]  generation
[4473.32 --> 4474.06]  of people
[4474.06 --> 4475.26]  who have
[4475.26 --> 4475.84]  taken that
[4475.84 --> 4476.34]  idea
[4476.34 --> 4478.08]  and turned
[4478.08 --> 4480.08]  the call
[4480.08 --> 4480.68]  to work
[4480.68 --> 4481.24]  hard
[4481.24 --> 4482.04]  into the
[4482.04 --> 4482.74]  idolatry
[4482.74 --> 4483.54]  of busyness.
[4484.18 --> 4484.76]  Right?
[4484.78 --> 4485.24]  We have to
[4485.24 --> 4485.80]  have the
[4485.80 --> 4486.90]  right attitude
[4486.90 --> 4489.02]  and we
[4489.02 --> 4489.54]  shouldn't
[4489.54 --> 4490.16]  make more
[4490.16 --> 4490.82]  of work
[4490.82 --> 4491.40]  than we
[4491.40 --> 4491.86]  ought to
[4491.86 --> 4492.26]  because that
[4492.26 --> 4492.92]  turns work
[4492.92 --> 4493.74]  into an
[4493.74 --> 4494.02]  idol.
[4494.22 --> 4494.56]  You shouldn't
[4494.56 --> 4495.06]  make more
[4495.06 --> 4495.62]  of work
[4495.62 --> 4496.10]  than you
[4496.10 --> 4496.48]  ought to
[4496.48 --> 4497.00]  because then
[4497.00 --> 4497.50]  that's all
[4497.50 --> 4497.86]  you are
[4497.86 --> 4498.70]  ever known
[4498.70 --> 4499.24]  by or
[4499.24 --> 4499.86]  know yourself
[4499.86 --> 4500.26]  by.
[4501.70 --> 4502.52]  But neither
[4502.52 --> 4502.94]  should we
[4502.94 --> 4503.48]  slide into
[4503.48 --> 4503.90]  idleness.
[4506.06 --> 4506.78]  Work hard
[4506.78 --> 4507.48]  to glorify
[4507.48 --> 4508.50]  God and
[4508.50 --> 4509.20]  ensure that
[4509.20 --> 4509.78]  we don't
[4509.78 --> 4510.98]  unnecessarily
[4510.98 --> 4511.48]  burden
[4511.48 --> 4512.40]  others.
[4513.88 --> 4514.64]  Work is
[4514.64 --> 4516.22]  good and
[4516.22 --> 4516.64]  so work
[4516.64 --> 4517.02]  hard.
[4517.02 --> 4517.06]  God.
[4518.66 --> 4519.24]  The second
[4519.24 --> 4519.74]  principle
[4519.74 --> 4520.94]  in our
[4520.94 --> 4521.40]  theology
[4521.40 --> 4521.94]  of work
[4521.94 --> 4522.68]  comes from
[4522.68 --> 4524.14]  verse 13
[4524.14 --> 4526.64]  where Paul
[4526.64 --> 4527.06]  says,
[4527.34 --> 4527.82]  As for you,
[4527.92 --> 4528.40]  brothers and
[4528.40 --> 4528.76]  sisters,
[4528.96 --> 4529.92]  never tire
[4529.92 --> 4531.60]  of doing
[4531.60 --> 4532.60]  what is
[4532.60 --> 4533.28]  good.
[4535.16 --> 4536.02]  I've already
[4536.02 --> 4536.86]  indicated this,
[4536.96 --> 4537.66]  but it can be
[4537.66 --> 4539.08]  really easy,
[4539.62 --> 4541.38]  especially if
[4541.38 --> 4541.80]  you've been
[4541.80 --> 4542.52]  taken advantage
[4542.52 --> 4544.00]  of, but it
[4544.00 --> 4544.54]  can be really
[4544.54 --> 4545.60]  easy to become
[4545.60 --> 4547.48]  apathetic and
[4547.48 --> 4548.42]  to stop being
[4548.42 --> 4549.02]  generous.
[4550.72 --> 4551.76]  I can imagine
[4551.76 --> 4552.40]  that for the
[4552.40 --> 4552.92]  church of
[4552.92 --> 4553.58]  Thessalonica,
[4553.84 --> 4554.58]  it was really
[4554.58 --> 4555.30]  easy for them
[4555.30 --> 4555.82]  to look at
[4555.82 --> 4556.28]  these brothers
[4556.28 --> 4556.98]  and sisters
[4556.98 --> 4558.04]  who were just
[4558.04 --> 4558.82]  lazing around
[4558.82 --> 4559.48]  and not doing
[4559.48 --> 4560.34]  anything and
[4560.34 --> 4560.50]  say,
[4560.56 --> 4560.94]  What's the
[4560.94 --> 4561.26]  point?
[4562.52 --> 4563.50]  Why should I
[4563.50 --> 4563.92]  give up
[4563.92 --> 4565.10]  everything just
[4565.10 --> 4565.66]  so they can
[4565.66 --> 4566.36]  have it easy?
[4567.78 --> 4568.64]  Or to put a
[4568.64 --> 4569.50]  finer point on
[4569.50 --> 4571.80]  it, why
[4571.80 --> 4572.46]  should I keep
[4572.46 --> 4573.02]  giving to the
[4573.02 --> 4573.98]  benevolence fund
[4573.98 --> 4575.48]  if those people
[4575.48 --> 4576.02]  can't figure
[4576.02 --> 4576.48]  their stuff
[4576.48 --> 4576.76]  out?
[4579.40 --> 4579.98]  Or why
[4579.98 --> 4580.48]  should I keep
[4580.48 --> 4581.00]  giving to the
[4581.00 --> 4582.06]  food bank if
[4582.06 --> 4582.56]  those people
[4582.56 --> 4583.34]  aren't just
[4583.34 --> 4583.66]  going to go
[4583.66 --> 4584.18]  get a job?
[4586.12 --> 4586.82]  Now, to be
[4586.82 --> 4588.90]  clear, this
[4588.90 --> 4589.48]  time hear what
[4589.48 --> 4589.92]  I'm saying,
[4590.58 --> 4591.44]  that is an
[4591.44 --> 4593.32]  unjust, unfair,
[4593.50 --> 4594.22]  and definitely
[4594.22 --> 4595.16]  ungracious
[4595.16 --> 4596.34]  assumption to
[4596.34 --> 4596.84]  make and to
[4596.84 --> 4597.28]  paint with such
[4597.28 --> 4597.90]  a broad stroke.
[4599.84 --> 4600.44]  But I know
[4600.44 --> 4600.86]  you've thought
[4600.86 --> 4602.58]  it, or let me
[4602.58 --> 4603.22]  be more candid,
[4603.62 --> 4604.30]  I know I've
[4604.30 --> 4604.66]  thought it.
[4605.48 --> 4607.64]  And you
[4607.64 --> 4607.94]  know what's
[4607.94 --> 4608.72]  really heartbreaking
[4608.72 --> 4609.52]  to me about
[4609.52 --> 4609.80]  this?
[4610.08 --> 4610.72]  I've thought
[4610.72 --> 4611.48]  that even
[4611.48 --> 4612.06]  though there
[4612.06 --> 4612.62]  was a time
[4612.62 --> 4613.34]  in my life
[4613.34 --> 4614.04]  where I
[4614.04 --> 4614.64]  used a food
[4614.64 --> 4616.32]  bank, where
[4616.32 --> 4617.06]  I was dependent
[4617.06 --> 4618.10]  upon a clothing
[4618.10 --> 4619.24]  exchange so
[4619.24 --> 4619.62]  that I could
[4619.62 --> 4620.66]  have a tie to
[4620.66 --> 4621.06]  the first
[4621.06 --> 4621.92]  interview I
[4621.92 --> 4622.16]  had.
[4623.28 --> 4623.94]  I should
[4623.94 --> 4624.46]  know better.
[4626.34 --> 4627.12]  But we can
[4627.12 --> 4628.00]  grow weary
[4628.00 --> 4628.94]  of doing good
[4628.94 --> 4629.54]  when it feels
[4629.54 --> 4629.98]  like we're the
[4629.98 --> 4630.64]  only ones doing
[4630.64 --> 4631.88]  it, or when
[4631.88 --> 4632.32]  it feels like
[4632.32 --> 4632.94]  no one else is
[4632.94 --> 4634.10]  willing to work
[4634.10 --> 4635.22]  at it, and
[4635.22 --> 4635.70]  when you look
[4635.70 --> 4636.36]  around and
[4636.36 --> 4637.04]  that's all you
[4637.04 --> 4638.88]  see, it makes
[4638.88 --> 4639.58]  you cynical,
[4640.66 --> 4642.94]  bitter, or
[4642.94 --> 4643.80]  even perhaps
[4643.80 --> 4644.68]  worse, it makes
[4644.68 --> 4645.14]  you proud.
[4646.72 --> 4647.74]  And when those
[4647.74 --> 4648.68]  kinds of thoughts
[4648.68 --> 4650.42]  creep in, the
[4650.42 --> 4651.24]  question of why
[4651.24 --> 4652.98]  bother quickly
[4652.98 --> 4653.78]  follows on its
[4653.78 --> 4654.02]  heels.
[4655.72 --> 4656.50]  And what Paul is
[4656.50 --> 4657.28]  saying here is
[4657.28 --> 4658.54]  don't listen to
[4658.54 --> 4659.28]  that voice.
[4660.40 --> 4661.02]  Don't be
[4661.02 --> 4661.80]  distracted by
[4661.80 --> 4662.70]  other people's
[4662.70 --> 4663.52]  wrongdoings.
[4663.62 --> 4664.54]  Instead, focus
[4664.54 --> 4665.14]  on your
[4665.14 --> 4666.12]  pursuit of
[4666.12 --> 4666.52]  holiness.
[4667.70 --> 4668.24]  What someone
[4668.24 --> 4669.02]  else does with
[4669.02 --> 4670.14]  your grace, with
[4670.14 --> 4670.96]  your generosity,
[4671.14 --> 4671.72]  isn't your
[4671.72 --> 4672.46]  responsibility.
[4672.90 --> 4673.60]  Your responsibility
[4673.60 --> 4674.72]  is to simply be
[4674.72 --> 4675.80]  gracious and be
[4675.80 --> 4676.28]  generous.
[4677.20 --> 4678.16]  Do not weary
[4678.16 --> 4679.90]  in doing good.
[4683.16 --> 4684.00]  Lastly, the
[4684.00 --> 4685.08]  third principle
[4685.08 --> 4688.80]  here recognizes
[4688.80 --> 4689.94]  that we need
[4689.94 --> 4691.62]  help, and we
[4691.62 --> 4691.94]  need to be
[4691.94 --> 4693.14]  reminded, and
[4693.14 --> 4693.52]  we need to be
[4693.52 --> 4694.04]  encouraged.
[4694.30 --> 4694.62]  The third
[4694.62 --> 4695.54]  principle here is
[4695.54 --> 4697.50]  a willingness to
[4697.50 --> 4698.64]  offer and
[4698.64 --> 4700.06]  receive mutual
[4700.06 --> 4700.64]  accountability.
[4702.34 --> 4703.12]  Now, this is a
[4703.12 --> 4704.92]  hard one, and
[4704.92 --> 4705.68]  understandably, it's
[4705.68 --> 4706.20]  not a popular
[4706.20 --> 4707.10]  one, perhaps
[4707.10 --> 4707.98]  especially in
[4707.98 --> 4708.62]  today's culture.
[4710.08 --> 4710.90]  But he's saying
[4710.90 --> 4712.06]  that as part of
[4712.06 --> 4712.92]  your obedience,
[4713.62 --> 4714.56]  take note of the
[4714.56 --> 4715.38]  people who aren't
[4715.38 --> 4715.90]  obeying.
[4718.02 --> 4718.14]  Right?
[4718.14 --> 4719.28]  Silence in
[4719.28 --> 4720.80]  disobedience is a
[4720.80 --> 4722.04]  passive condoning or
[4722.04 --> 4723.22]  approval of that
[4723.22 --> 4723.56]  action.
[4725.06 --> 4725.48]  And Paul says,
[4725.62 --> 4726.32]  don't associate with
[4726.32 --> 4727.54]  them, that they
[4727.54 --> 4728.42]  might feel ashamed,
[4728.54 --> 4729.08]  that they might be
[4729.08 --> 4730.30]  made aware of what's
[4730.30 --> 4730.54]  going on.
[4730.58 --> 4731.72]  He wants them to
[4731.72 --> 4733.38]  see their disobeying
[4733.38 --> 4734.26]  and to repent.
[4735.54 --> 4736.36]  And the whole
[4736.36 --> 4738.34]  church has a part
[4738.34 --> 4739.60]  to play in helping
[4739.60 --> 4740.52]  one another see
[4740.52 --> 4741.22]  this truth.
[4744.32 --> 4745.38]  I'll never forget
[4745.38 --> 4746.90]  when I had a group
[4746.90 --> 4748.98]  of friends who
[4748.98 --> 4749.82]  came out to
[4749.82 --> 4751.22]  visit me in
[4751.22 --> 4751.98]  order to sit me
[4751.98 --> 4752.92]  down and have
[4752.92 --> 4753.64]  what we in our
[4753.64 --> 4754.64]  family call a
[4754.64 --> 4755.14]  come-to-Jesus
[4755.14 --> 4755.78]  conversation.
[4757.58 --> 4758.64]  They came out to
[4758.64 --> 4759.30]  hold me accountable.
[4760.58 --> 4761.48]  And through their
[4761.48 --> 4762.64]  concerns and through
[4762.64 --> 4764.10]  their tears and out
[4764.10 --> 4764.74]  of their mutual
[4764.74 --> 4765.70]  love for me, they
[4765.70 --> 4766.32]  had some hard
[4766.32 --> 4767.08]  things to say.
[4768.36 --> 4769.06]  And then God
[4769.06 --> 4770.20]  used that to
[4770.20 --> 4771.74]  help me hear and
[4771.74 --> 4772.66]  see what had been
[4772.66 --> 4774.64]  a blind spot and
[4774.64 --> 4775.02]  to make some
[4775.02 --> 4775.36]  changes.
[4775.36 --> 4777.22]  that's what this
[4777.22 --> 4777.70]  is about.
[4779.84 --> 4781.14]  And despite Paul's
[4781.14 --> 4782.26]  firmness and his
[4782.26 --> 4783.38]  frustration, or
[4783.38 --> 4784.64]  perhaps exactly in
[4784.64 --> 4785.48]  it and because of
[4785.48 --> 4786.88]  it, he's being
[4786.88 --> 4787.76]  pastoral.
[4788.78 --> 4790.30]  He longs for these
[4790.30 --> 4791.44]  brothers and sisters
[4791.44 --> 4793.62]  as just that, as
[4793.62 --> 4794.66]  family members in
[4794.66 --> 4795.04]  the Lord.
[4795.52 --> 4796.44]  He desires
[4796.44 --> 4797.88]  restoration and
[4797.88 --> 4798.60]  faithfulness.
[4798.72 --> 4799.60]  He desires their
[4799.60 --> 4801.16]  obedience as the
[4801.16 --> 4802.32]  only right way to
[4802.32 --> 4803.12]  respond to the
[4803.12 --> 4804.00]  grace of God given
[4804.00 --> 4804.94]  to us in the
[4804.94 --> 4805.30]  gospel.
[4806.62 --> 4807.40]  And as a
[4807.40 --> 4808.96]  community shaped by
[4808.96 --> 4810.40]  grace, we need to
[4810.40 --> 4811.94]  see work not as a
[4811.94 --> 4813.16]  burden, but as a
[4813.16 --> 4813.52]  gift.
[4814.82 --> 4815.96]  As something we do
[4815.96 --> 4817.34]  to honor God and to
[4817.34 --> 4818.16]  care for those
[4818.16 --> 4818.98]  around us.
[4818.98 --> 4819.66]  As something that
[4819.66 --> 4821.58]  God uses in his
[4821.58 --> 4823.06]  providential rule of
[4823.06 --> 4824.56]  the world to care for
[4824.56 --> 4825.64]  his people and to
[4825.64 --> 4826.54]  provide for them.
[4827.56 --> 4827.68]  Right?
[4827.74 --> 4828.88]  Generosity isn't just a
[4828.88 --> 4829.70]  nice idea.
[4830.12 --> 4831.48]  It's a calling to give
[4831.48 --> 4833.44]  freely and sacrificially,
[4833.98 --> 4835.94]  especially when it's
[4835.94 --> 4837.16]  not easy or
[4837.16 --> 4837.66]  convenient.
[4839.74 --> 4840.72]  And accountability in
[4840.72 --> 4841.74]  these moments isn't
[4841.74 --> 4843.42]  just about judging or
[4843.42 --> 4844.56]  shaming each other.
[4845.38 --> 4846.92]  It's an act of love
[4846.92 --> 4848.84]  that helps us stay
[4848.84 --> 4851.10]  faithful and grow
[4851.10 --> 4852.20]  together.
[4852.20 --> 4852.26]  together.
[4855.26 --> 4858.50]  And so this morning, as
[4858.50 --> 4861.78]  we go from here, whether
[4861.78 --> 4862.94]  it's into the ordinary
[4862.94 --> 4864.72]  kinds of work that you
[4864.72 --> 4865.76]  have to do or the
[4865.76 --> 4866.98]  extraordinary kinds of
[4866.98 --> 4868.34]  work that the Lord calls
[4868.34 --> 4869.38]  you to, it's in the
[4869.38 --> 4871.64]  everyday rhythms and
[4871.64 --> 4873.66]  movements of your life.
[4873.68 --> 4875.38]  As we go from here, it
[4875.38 --> 4877.76]  is my prayer that we
[4877.76 --> 4880.08]  might commit to living
[4880.08 --> 4882.14]  out this truth
[4882.14 --> 4882.92]  better.
[4883.42 --> 4884.48]  That we might work
[4884.48 --> 4886.28]  diligently and give
[4886.28 --> 4887.78]  generously and that we
[4887.78 --> 4889.00]  might hold one another
[4889.00 --> 4891.38]  gently but firmly to the
[4891.38 --> 4892.42]  standards of
[4892.42 --> 4893.32]  faithfulness.
[4894.94 --> 4896.50]  And so that might mean
[4896.50 --> 4898.22]  asking yourself today,
[4898.92 --> 4902.06]  how am I contributing to
[4902.06 --> 4903.78]  the health of our
[4903.78 --> 4904.58]  community?
[4906.26 --> 4907.68]  It might mean asking
[4907.68 --> 4908.76]  yourself today, if you
[4908.76 --> 4911.38]  are willing, how am I
[4911.38 --> 4913.74]  obstructing the health
[4913.74 --> 4915.10]  of our community?
[4917.58 --> 4919.00]  But for sure it means
[4919.00 --> 4921.10]  asking yourself, where
[4921.10 --> 4921.92]  can I step up?
[4922.40 --> 4923.40]  Where can I step up in
[4923.40 --> 4923.74]  work?
[4924.04 --> 4925.04]  Where can I step up in
[4925.04 --> 4925.52]  generosity?
[4925.92 --> 4927.02]  And where can I step up
[4927.02 --> 4928.52]  in loving accountability?
[4929.84 --> 4930.94]  It's my prayer that
[4930.94 --> 4932.66]  together we would be a
[4932.66 --> 4933.76]  church that is known for
[4933.76 --> 4935.06]  all three of these.
[4936.36 --> 4938.16]  Not one to the exclusion of
[4938.16 --> 4939.84]  the other or two to the
[4939.84 --> 4941.56]  exclusion of a third, but
[4941.56 --> 4943.72]  that in all three ways we
[4943.72 --> 4945.76]  might genuinely believe that
[4945.76 --> 4948.00]  work is good and work hard.
[4948.10 --> 4950.04]  We might genuinely practice a
[4950.04 --> 4951.54]  generosity that is
[4951.54 --> 4953.62]  prodigious and unyielding in
[4953.62 --> 4955.44]  the face of bitterness and
[4955.44 --> 4955.96]  criticism.
[4957.14 --> 4960.44]  And that we might lovingly hold
[4960.44 --> 4962.22]  one another accountable to
[4962.22 --> 4964.22]  this kind of gospel-saturated
[4965.06 --> 4966.56]  life together.
[4967.36 --> 4969.04]  That, I think, is a
[4969.04 --> 4971.54]  beautiful story worth telling.
[4972.26 --> 4972.52]  Amen?
[4973.32 --> 4974.34]  Let's pray together.
[4979.62 --> 4982.70]  Holy God, as we come before
[4982.70 --> 4990.04]  you, we confess that idleness,
[4992.20 --> 4995.80]  laziness, sloth are easy
[4995.80 --> 4997.90]  realities at certain times.
[4998.98 --> 5003.68]  We confess that cynicism,
[5004.86 --> 5009.02]  bitterness, and apathy creep in
[5009.02 --> 5010.22]  at times.
[5012.04 --> 5013.68]  And we confess that we,
[5015.84 --> 5017.86]  in fear of how others might
[5017.86 --> 5022.74]  respond, don't always lay the
[5022.74 --> 5024.48]  burdens that you, the Holy
[5024.48 --> 5025.88]  Spirit, put on our hearts for
[5025.88 --> 5026.20]  them.
[5026.82 --> 5027.98]  We don't always express them.
[5029.66 --> 5031.32]  And we confess that we don't
[5031.32 --> 5034.16]  always receive accountability as
[5034.16 --> 5036.26]  your means of grace to us.
[5036.26 --> 5039.68]  And so in this confession, Lord
[5039.68 --> 5041.26]  Jesus, hear our prayer and
[5042.00 --> 5043.52]  remind us again of the gospel
[5043.52 --> 5046.26]  truth that you love us and
[5046.96 --> 5048.76]  that out of that deep love for
[5048.76 --> 5050.56]  us, you came into the world in
[5050.56 --> 5052.60]  Christ Jesus and you demonstrated
[5052.60 --> 5054.56]  that love in perfectly keeping
[5054.56 --> 5056.58]  all the commands of the law and
[5056.58 --> 5058.64]  in perfectly expressing what it
[5058.64 --> 5061.24]  means to be a lavishly loved
[5061.24 --> 5062.46]  child of the Father.
[5062.46 --> 5067.12]  and that though innocent, you
[5067.12 --> 5069.78]  died for us, sinners.
[5073.98 --> 5077.42]  May we see that cross of mercy
[5077.42 --> 5078.14]  and grace.
[5079.30 --> 5081.30]  May we see the truth of the
[5081.30 --> 5083.76]  empty tomb and may we be raised in
[5083.76 --> 5085.76]  newness of life by the power of your
[5085.76 --> 5088.60]  Spirit to live compelling lives where
[5088.60 --> 5092.94]  work is good, where generosity is
[5092.94 --> 5096.04]  abundant, and where we walk
[5096.04 --> 5098.24]  together being transformed into
[5098.24 --> 5099.96]  the image of your Son, Jesus
[5099.96 --> 5102.46]  Christ, our Savior, in whose name
[5102.46 --> 5103.04]  we pray.
[5103.96 --> 5104.36]  Amen.
[5104.36 --> 5104.42]  Amen.
[5105.42 --> 5105.90]  Amen.
[5118.60 --> 5124.56]  For you I hail my master and maker
[5124.56 --> 5129.46]  To honor the work of my hands
[5129.46 --> 5133.64]  For this is the day you've given your
[5133.64 --> 5134.24]  soul
[5134.24 --> 5139.44]  I will rejoice and be glad
[5139.44 --> 5143.62]  For all the strength I have to live and
[5143.62 --> 5144.48]  bring
[5144.48 --> 5149.40]  For each day your grace has given me
[5149.40 --> 5153.84]  For the needs and opportunities
[5153.84 --> 5157.70]  That will glorify your grace
[5157.70 --> 5172.72]  Before you I kneel and ask for your goodness
[5172.72 --> 5177.54]  To cover the work of my hands
[5177.54 --> 5179.94]  For patience and peace
[5179.94 --> 5182.68]  To shame all my labor
[5182.68 --> 5187.72]  Your grace for the words in my hand
[5187.72 --> 5192.70]  For all will give me like a living stream
[5192.70 --> 5197.58]  Wear away the soul to thine and be
[5197.58 --> 5202.46]  Till your ways are dwelling deep in me
[5202.46 --> 5207.28]  And a harvest of life is grown
[5207.28 --> 5207.98]  Woman heaven in me
[5207.98 --> 5208.90]  with the burden on the shining
[5208.90 --> 5211.04]  Thin fellow
[5211.04 --> 5212.42]  God
[5212.42 --> 5213.58]  солн��ral
[5213.58 --> 5214.14]  God

[5216.90 --> 5217.18] eg
[5217.18 --> 5247.16]  Thank you.
[5247.18 --> 5277.16]  Thank you.
[5277.18 --> 5286.78]  In every small and great task, may we lift the gospel of your grace.
[5287.28 --> 5291.64]  Serve your purpose as our fleeting days.
[5292.30 --> 5296.56]  Then our lives will bring eternal grace.
[5296.56 --> 5300.42]  And our glory to your release.
[5301.52 --> 5305.56]  And our glory to your release.
[5305.56 --> 5334.30]  As we end today and go into this week, I'm going to pronounce over us again the blessing from Paul at the end of 2 Thessalonians.
[5334.30 --> 5340.08]  Thessalonians. Before we go, just an encouragement, stick around after our service for some fellowship
[5340.08 --> 5344.74]  and some gathering time together as well. If you're looking to pray with someone or to meet
[5344.74 --> 5348.76]  with someone, there will be someone up here with a yellow name tag on who would love to meet you
[5348.76 --> 5355.12]  and pray with you. You can also find one of the elders in our church. Many of them should be
[5355.12 --> 5361.36]  wearing name tags as well, or you can grab me in the foyer afterwards as well. Receive the blessing
[5361.36 --> 5364.72]  of God for the week ahead.
[5367.64 --> 5377.46]  Now, may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with all
[5377.46 --> 5383.54]  of you. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
[5391.36 --> 5421.34]  There is a Redeemer, Jesus God and Son. Precious and Son of God.
[5421.34 --> 5422.34]  Amen.
[5422.34 --> 5423.34]  Amen.
[5423.34 --> 5424.34]  Amen.
[5424.34 --> 5451.32]  Thank you all my Father for giving us your Son and leaving your Spirit till the world on earth is done.

[5503.60 --> 5509.04]  I will see His face,
[5509.04 --> 5513.94]  May I serve my King forever,
[5514.94 --> 5519.04]  In that holy name.
[5520.76 --> 5525.62]  Thank you, my Father,
