[719.98 --> 749.96]  Thank you.
[749.98 --> 779.96]  Thank you.
[779.98 --> 809.96]  Thank you.
[809.96 --> 816.40]  Thank you.
[839.96 --> 841.76]  that ministry fair seems to be winding down.
[841.94 --> 843.94]  So just poke your head in that room
[843.94 --> 845.40]  every once in a while and we'll see when we get started.
[845.70 --> 847.50]  I'm going to invite out Pastor Chris now
[847.50 --> 849.56]  and he's got a few more announcements for us today.
[869.96 --> 875.60]  How about now? Yeah?
[876.50 --> 877.74]  There? Are we getting it?
[877.74 --> 879.32]  Wrong mic.
[879.68 --> 881.56]  Oh, Peyton.
[885.30 --> 887.40]  Try to get someone new back there.
[890.46 --> 891.62]  Welcome to church
[891.62 --> 894.52]  where everybody makes mistakes
[894.52 --> 896.06]  and we laugh at them.
[897.12 --> 898.24]  My name is Chris.
[898.38 --> 899.54]  I'm one of the pastors here
[899.54 --> 901.78]  and it's my privilege to welcome you
[901.78 --> 903.28]  to worship this morning
[903.28 --> 905.64]  especially as we celebrate the beginning
[905.64 --> 909.54]  of our 2025-2026 ministry year.
[910.08 --> 912.32]  There's a ministry fair happening at the back
[912.32 --> 913.22]  after service.
[913.34 --> 914.86]  Really encourage you to check that out
[914.86 --> 916.92]  to find a place to connect
[916.92 --> 920.32]  to sign up for different classes
[920.32 --> 922.34]  and opportunities to serve.
[922.70 --> 924.50]  That's all at the back, all afterwards
[924.50 --> 925.76]  and so please check that out.
[926.18 --> 927.20]  Stick around and connect.
[927.76 --> 929.18]  We have a couple more announcements.
[929.54 --> 931.74]  Next Saturday,
[932.28 --> 935.32]  we are sending a group of worship leaders
[935.32 --> 936.88]  to Sunridge Gardens,
[937.08 --> 939.26]  which is a retirement living facility up the hill.
[939.48 --> 942.42]  That's one week earlier than we normally do
[942.42 --> 944.28]  because on October 4,
[944.28 --> 946.12]  we're hosting a worship conference
[946.12 --> 948.28]  here at Emmanuel
[948.28 --> 951.44]  with Brian Dirksen, Joshua Leventhal,
[951.44 --> 952.98]  and Caitlin Rose Leventhal.
[954.06 --> 955.30]  And so we wanted to make sure
[955.30 --> 957.56]  that we could still serve the Sunridge community
[957.56 --> 958.70]  in a particular way
[958.70 --> 960.98]  and also this community in our worship conference.
[961.10 --> 963.02]  And so next Saturday at Sunridge,
[963.16 --> 965.26]  please, everyone's invited to join there.
[965.60 --> 967.94]  And then the following Saturday on the 4th
[967.94 --> 969.30]  for the worship conference,
[969.30 --> 970.74]  all of the details for that
[970.74 --> 972.00]  can be found in the e-bulletin.
[972.16 --> 973.26]  You can talk to me afterwards.
[974.64 --> 976.04]  As well, this week,
[976.10 --> 977.86]  as part of our kickoff and launch,
[977.96 --> 980.72]  we have a three-year
[980.72 --> 983.24]  read through the Bible group
[983.24 --> 985.98]  that's starting this coming Wednesday night.
[986.68 --> 988.08]  And so this Wednesday night
[988.08 --> 989.58]  is our first meeting
[989.58 --> 991.20]  and we're going to gather together
[991.20 --> 993.32]  having already read the book of Genesis
[993.32 --> 995.44]  and then we're going to discuss Genesis
[995.44 --> 997.32]  and then we'll keep rolling through.
[997.44 --> 998.68]  If you have any questions about that
[998.68 --> 1000.76]  or you would like to sign up for the information,
[1001.26 --> 1002.74]  again, you can grab me at the back.
[1002.98 --> 1004.84]  I'll give you that information there.
[1005.38 --> 1006.24]  And then lastly,
[1006.66 --> 1008.64]  many of you have probably already seen
[1008.64 --> 1010.60]  that the Mexico mission trip
[1010.60 --> 1012.44]  sign-up sheet has gone out.
[1012.92 --> 1015.68]  This is a trip, grade 10s,
[1016.20 --> 1017.82]  to however old you want
[1017.82 --> 1019.94]  that happens during March break.
[1020.02 --> 1021.60]  So March 14 to 24,
[1021.88 --> 1023.08]  that sign-up is now live
[1023.08 --> 1024.42]  and Brandon is here.
[1024.42 --> 1026.04]  Brandon's going to put his hand up even higher.
[1026.46 --> 1027.06]  There he is.
[1027.60 --> 1028.42]  If you have any questions,
[1028.50 --> 1030.48]  you can grab him after our service.
[1031.68 --> 1032.74]  I think that's it.
[1033.44 --> 1033.60]  Yeah?
[1034.72 --> 1036.66]  Look to Kevin for all the information.
[1037.60 --> 1038.54]  Let's stand together
[1038.54 --> 1041.32]  that we might be welcomed by God.
[1044.20 --> 1045.26]  Louise Condos.
[1046.44 --> 1047.42]  Thank you, Louise.
[1048.08 --> 1049.12]  Thursday night, see?
[1049.38 --> 1049.94]  Look to Kevin
[1049.94 --> 1051.66]  and he sees other people at the back.
[1052.12 --> 1053.46]  Nikki, even better.
[1053.46 --> 1054.64]  All right.
[1054.78 --> 1055.50]  Thursday night.
[1055.58 --> 1056.76]  This Thursday night,
[1056.92 --> 1060.08]  we are hosting a prayer gathering.
[1060.82 --> 1062.44]  And so that's just for anyone
[1062.44 --> 1064.22]  who wants to come together and pray.
[1064.62 --> 1066.10]  We know that there are so many things
[1066.10 --> 1067.46]  happening in our world
[1067.46 --> 1068.48]  and in our hearts.
[1068.96 --> 1070.56]  And our first response
[1070.56 --> 1071.48]  should be to pray
[1071.48 --> 1072.64]  when that is true.
[1072.76 --> 1073.74]  And so Thursday night
[1073.74 --> 1075.40]  at 7 p.m.,
[1075.40 --> 1076.84]  we're going to gather here
[1076.84 --> 1077.68]  somewhere
[1077.68 --> 1079.80]  for a time of prayer.
[1079.92 --> 1081.24]  And so mark that on your calendars.
[1081.24 --> 1082.46]  Please make a point of coming
[1082.46 --> 1083.32]  for that.
[1083.68 --> 1084.34]  Thank you, Louise.
[1085.82 --> 1087.06]  Now I think we're ready to go.
[1087.14 --> 1088.26]  Let's receive God's blessing
[1088.26 --> 1089.76]  as we come together
[1089.76 --> 1090.24]  and worship.
[1092.60 --> 1093.00]  Grace,
[1094.08 --> 1094.48]  mercy,
[1095.10 --> 1095.96]  and peace to you
[1095.96 --> 1097.14]  from God our Father,
[1097.58 --> 1098.64]  from the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1098.74 --> 1099.18]  His Son,
[1099.64 --> 1100.28]  and our Savior,
[1100.84 --> 1102.06]  through the presence and power
[1102.06 --> 1103.38]  of the Holy Spirit.
[1104.32 --> 1104.60]  Amen.
[1104.60 --> 1106.36]  I'm going to invite you
[1106.36 --> 1107.34]  to welcome those around you
[1107.34 --> 1108.32]  into our shared worship
[1108.32 --> 1108.74]  this morning.
[1110.96 --> 1111.22]  Yeah.
[1111.62 --> 1112.14]  Peace to Christ.
[1134.60 --> 1143.66]  Psalm 24.
[1144.66 --> 1146.30]  Who may climb the mountain
[1146.30 --> 1147.18]  of the Lord?
[1147.82 --> 1149.04]  Who may stand
[1149.04 --> 1150.44]  in His holy place?
[1151.24 --> 1152.10]  Only those
[1152.10 --> 1153.50]  whose hands and hearts
[1153.50 --> 1154.12]  are pure,
[1154.56 --> 1156.10]  who do not worship idols
[1156.10 --> 1157.62]  and never tell lies.
[1158.24 --> 1159.26]  They will receive
[1159.26 --> 1160.16]  the Lord's blessing
[1160.16 --> 1161.74]  and have a right relationship
[1161.74 --> 1163.08]  with God their Savior.
[1163.08 --> 1165.40]  such people may seek you
[1165.40 --> 1167.38]  and worship in your presence,
[1168.00 --> 1168.98]  O God of Jacob.
[1189.74 --> 1191.40]  There is singing
[1191.40 --> 1192.98]  at the ancient
[1192.98 --> 1193.98]  gates.
[1193.98 --> 1195.98]  There is a melody
[1196.56 --> 1199.12]  of ceaseless praise.
[1199.54 --> 1201.32]  Age to age,
[1201.42 --> 1202.28]  the sound
[1202.28 --> 1206.14]  is only growing stronger.
[1209.14 --> 1210.68]  There is a throne
[1210.68 --> 1214.00]  beneath the name of names.
[1214.52 --> 1215.58]  There is seated
[1215.58 --> 1218.20]  on it one who raises,
[1218.20 --> 1220.20]  and His kingdom
[1220.20 --> 1220.58]  and His kingdom
[1220.58 --> 1222.20]  now is here
[1222.20 --> 1225.20]  and getting closer.
[1228.70 --> 1230.18]  Praise Him
[1230.18 --> 1233.38]  like we're there in glory.
[1233.38 --> 1235.52]  Here and now
[1235.52 --> 1238.06]  He's just as holy.
[1238.56 --> 1239.26]  Jesus,
[1239.76 --> 1241.68]  He's so worthy
[1241.68 --> 1243.66]  of it all.
[1243.66 --> 1250.66]  He exists in everlasting light.
[1250.66 --> 1251.66]  He exists in everlasting light.
[1251.66 --> 1253.90]  So on heaven's streets
[1253.90 --> 1256.24]  there is no night.
[1256.66 --> 1260.44]  Every tear is wiped away.
[1260.98 --> 1263.06]  We'll know no sorrow.
[1263.06 --> 1264.58] 龙 mira
[1264.58 --> 1265.18]  in everlasting light.
[1266.06 --> 1267.04]  Lord,
[1267.12 --> 1267.84]  Lord,
[1267.84 --> 1268.36]  Jesus,
[1268.36 --> 1268.98]  Dios,
[1269.10 --> 1271.20]  the end here was
[1271.20 --> 1272.76]  as faithful and
[1272.76 --> 1273.56]  of Jesus.
[1273.56 --> 1274.26]  The grace of His love
[1274.26 --> 1274.82]  is awesome.
[1275.06 --> 1275.64]  Facebook Earth
[1275.64 --> 1276.52]  that we've been

[1276.90 --> 1277.22]  widing light.

[1694.46 --> 1709.36]  I will put my trust in you alone. And I will not be shaken.
[1710.20 --> 1719.20]  Holy, there is no one like you. There is none beside you.
[1719.20 --> 1732.34]  Open up my eyes in wonder. Show me who you are and fill me with your heart.
[1732.68 --> 1740.10]  And lead me in your love to those around me.
[1743.10 --> 1744.88]  You may have a seat.
[1749.20 --> 1755.84]  There are many examples in this world of life being uncertain.
[1756.84 --> 1762.62]  Even again in these last few weeks, we have been reminded of how fleeting life is.
[1763.16 --> 1766.88]  How there is trouble and hardship, war and violence.
[1767.40 --> 1770.78]  And they continue to surround us and permeate our lives.
[1770.78 --> 1775.46]  Exodus 14 verse 14 says,
[1776.34 --> 1780.72]  The Lord will fight for you. You need only to be still.
[1781.76 --> 1784.70]  Psalm 37 verse 7 says,
[1785.50 --> 1790.00]  Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him.
[1791.00 --> 1793.06]  Mark 4 verse 39 says,
[1793.06 --> 1815.94]  Let's take a moment now this morning to give our turmoil both in this world and in our personal lives to Jesus.
[1815.94 --> 1816.38]  Matthew 24 says,
[1816.38 --> 1816.62]  no care.
[1842.44 --> 1842.98]  It's okay.
[1842.98 --> 1869.36]  Still, my soul, be still, and do not fear.
[1869.36 --> 1880.36]  Though winds of change may rage tomorrow, God is at your side.
[1881.50 --> 1889.54]  No longer dread the fires of unexpected sorrow.
[1889.54 --> 1903.04]  God, you are my God, and I will trust in you and not be shaken.
[1903.04 --> 1920.04]  Lord of peace, renew my steadfast spirit within me to rest in you alone.
[1920.04 --> 1943.28]  Still, my soul, be still, and do not be moved by lesser lights and fleeting shadows.
[1943.28 --> 1957.48]  Hold on to his ways with shield of faith against temptations, flaming arrows.
[1957.98 --> 1970.52]  God, you are my God, and I will trust in you and not be shaken.
[1970.52 --> 1987.40]  Lord of peace, renew a steadfast spirit within me to rest in you alone.
[1987.40 --> 2009.40]  Still, my soul, be still, do not forsake the truth you learned in the beginning.
[2009.40 --> 2023.40]  Wait upon the Lord, and hope will rise as stars appear when day is dimming.
[2024.40 --> 2037.06]  God, you are my God, and I will trust in you and not be shaken.
[2037.06 --> 2051.96]  Lord of peace, renew a steadfast spirit within me to rest in you.
[2051.96 --> 2064.16]  God, you are my God, and I will trust in you and not be shaken.
[2064.16 --> 2080.16]  Lord of peace, renew a steadfast spirit within me to rest in you alone.
[2080.16 --> 2088.96]  Please stand and hear these words of assurance this morning.
[2089.76 --> 2091.82]  From Ephesians chapter 6.
[2091.82 --> 2096.28]  Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.
[2097.14 --> 2101.72]  Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.
[2102.30 --> 2108.74]  For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities,
[2109.26 --> 2115.60]  against the powers of this dark world, and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.
[2115.60 --> 2123.70]  Therefore, put on the full armor of God so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground,
[2124.14 --> 2126.92]  and after you have done everything, to stand.
[2127.92 --> 2131.80]  Stand firm then with the belt of truth buckled around your waist,
[2132.20 --> 2139.62]  with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.
[2139.62 --> 2148.78]  In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
[2149.52 --> 2155.50]  Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
[2155.50 --> 2180.22]  This is my prayer in the desert, when all that's within me feels dry.
[2180.22 --> 2185.04]  This is my prayer in my hunger and need.
[2185.30 --> 2188.04]  My God is the God who provides.
[2189.66 --> 2192.40]  This is my prayer in the fire.
[2193.62 --> 2196.78]  In weakness or trial or pain.
[2198.06 --> 2201.80]  There is a faith to the more worth than gold.
[2202.12 --> 2205.02]  So refine me, Lord, through the pain.
[2205.50 --> 2207.50]  I will bring praise.
[2207.64 --> 2209.46]  I will bring praise.
[2209.46 --> 2213.02]  No weapon form against me shall remain.
[2213.84 --> 2215.50]  I will rejoice.
[2216.04 --> 2217.34]  I will declare.
[2218.18 --> 2221.84]  God is my victory and He is here.
[2229.10 --> 2232.42]  This is my prayer in the battle.
[2233.42 --> 2236.60]  When triumph is still on its way.
[2236.60 --> 2238.92]  I am a conqueror.
[2238.92 --> 2241.50]  I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ.
[2241.50 --> 2244.92]  So fire on His promise I'll stand.
[2244.92 --> 2247.00]  I will bring praise.
[2247.20 --> 2249.06]  I will bring praise.
[2249.06 --> 2252.92]  No weapon form against me shall remain.
[2252.98 --> 2255.12]  I will rejoice.
[2255.12 --> 2256.92]  I will declare.
[2256.92 --> 2261.30]  God is my victory and He is here.
[2261.36 --> 2264.78]  This is my prayer in the battle.
[2264.78 --> 2265.78]  You will bring praise.
[2265.78 --> 2267.66]  Lord, for thejoies will have been great.
[2268.62 --> 2269.58]  Let'swan terms and heal.
[2270.30 --> 2271.68]  Everything for mercy and He is here.
[2271.68 --> 2273.78]  Very camp to endure.
[2273.78 --> 2284.20]  All of my life in every season,
[2284.26 --> 2285.30]  You are still God.
[2285.30 --> 2298.30]  you are still God I have a reason to say I have a reason to worship
[2298.30 --> 2302.30]  Oh
[2315.30 --> 2331.30]  I have a reason to say I have a reason to worship
[2331.30 --> 2335.30]  I will bring praise
[2335.30 --> 2340.30]  I will
[2340.30 --> 2350.30]  I will rejoice I will declare God is my victory and I will bring praise I will bring praise
[2350.30 --> 2354.30]  no one who has been formed against me shall remain
[2354.30 --> 2363.30]  I will rejoice I will declare God is my victory and He is here
[2370.30 --> 2387.30]  this is my prayer in the harvest when favor and providence flow
[2387.30 --> 2399.30]  I know I feel to be emptied again the seed I received I will sow
[2399.30 --> 2416.30]  I will glory in my Redeemer who is proud of me
[2416.30 --> 2433.30]  I will glory in my Redeemer whose priceless blood has ransomed me
[2433.30 --> 2443.30]  mine was the seed that drove the bitter nail and hung him on that judgment tree
[2443.30 --> 2452.30]  I will glory in my Redeemer who crushed the power of sin and death
[2452.30 --> 2459.30]  my holy Savior before the holy John
[2459.30 --> 2463.30]  the man who is my righteous man
[2463.30 --> 2467.30]  the man who is my righteous man
[2467.30 --> 2477.30]  I will glory in my Redeemer
[2477.30 --> 2480.30]  I will glory in my Redeemer
[2480.30 --> 2485.30]  my life be God my love be old
[2485.30 --> 2490.30]  I have no longings for another
[2490.30 --> 2493.30]  I am satisfied in Him alone
[2493.30 --> 2500.30]  I will glory in my Redeemer
[2500.30 --> 2505.30]  His faithfulness my standing place
[2505.30 --> 2511.30]  Lord, falls on my knee and rush upon me
[2511.30 --> 2515.30]  My feet are firm held by His grace
[2515.30 --> 2520.30]  My feet are firm held by His grace
[2520.30 --> 2529.30]  My feet are firm held by His grace
[2529.30 --> 2537.30]  I will glory in my Redeemer who carries me on eagles' ways
[2537.30 --> 2542.30]  He crowns my arm with love and high best
[2542.30 --> 2559.20]  and
[2562.20 --> 2572.24]  of
[2572.24 --> 2582.56]  By the glory and my Redeemer, who waits for me at gates of gold.
[2582.56 --> 2588.56]  And when He calls me, it will be paradise.
[2589.90 --> 2594.02]  His face forever to behold.
[2595.10 --> 2599.34]  His face forever to behold.
[2602.24 --> 2606.00]  You may have a seat.
[2624.94 --> 2625.86]  Good morning.
[2626.42 --> 2627.40]  My name is Pearl.
[2627.56 --> 2629.40]  I'm one of the deacons here at Langley Emanuel.
[2629.40 --> 2632.28]  And we continue worship by having an offering.
[2633.14 --> 2635.18]  Today's offerings are first for the budget.
[2635.80 --> 2638.58]  And on the screen, you can see ways to give.
[2638.58 --> 2644.44]  If you give via the bags that are passed around, then do mark your offering as such.
[2644.86 --> 2647.60]  You can use the envelopes that are in the chairs in front of you.
[2648.50 --> 2654.68]  And our other offering today is for NAME, which stands for North American Indigenous Ministries.
[2654.68 --> 2664.40]  And our offerings specifically go to Tim and Charity Johnson, who serve in the Kamloops area with the Kamloops Indigenous bands.
[2665.34 --> 2668.56]  NAME has other places where they work at.
[2668.56 --> 2678.18]  They have places in Alberta, in Saskatchewan, and also in Washington State and Montana and in New Mexico.
[2679.24 --> 2695.38]  And their mission is to spread the gospel of Jesus to Indigenous people through cultural activities and through one-to-one relationships and also through reconciliation.
[2695.38 --> 2701.28]  So as the bags are being passed around today, we also have a special treat.
[2701.50 --> 2704.14]  We have a thank you video that will be shown.
[2704.82 --> 2709.92]  You might remember that this church, we had a surplus in our budget.
[2709.92 --> 2722.18]  And we agreed as a congregation to give some of that surplus to ministry shares, which meant that we actually gave beyond our pledge to ministry shares.
[2722.62 --> 2733.50]  And the head office in Burlington, the Canadian division of the CRC Church, was just so grateful, so thankful, so surprised that they have sent us this thank you video.
[2734.12 --> 2737.76]  So do enjoy this video as the bags are being passed around.
[2737.76 --> 2738.92]  And do give generously.
[2739.42 --> 2739.82]  Thank you.
[2739.92 --> 2769.90]  Thank you.
[2769.90 --> 2770.38]  Thank you.
[2770.48 --> 2771.90]  Thank you.
[2771.90 --> 2772.16]  Thank you.
[2772.40 --> 2772.90]  Thank you.
[2773.00 --> 2773.40]  Thank you.
[2773.60 --> 2774.90]  Thank you.
[2775.38 --> 2775.90]  Thank you.
[2776.42 --> 2776.80]  Thank you.
[2776.80 --> 2790.68]  Thank you, everybody.
[2791.16 --> 2793.72]  Thank you.
[2793.72 --> 2795.36]  coming year.
[2795.36 --> 2801.28]  Reframe is a media ministry of the CRC that is proclaiming the gospel, discipling believers,
[2801.28 --> 2805.72]  and strengthening the church worldwide in 10 major languages.
[2805.72 --> 2810.32]  One of those is in Burkina Faso, where the French language ministry is reaching new people
[2810.32 --> 2816.38]  for Christ and the church is growing faster than the ministry can even seem to keep up.
[2816.38 --> 2821.78]  Thrive is helping churches like yours with encouragement, connections, and tools.
[2821.78 --> 2827.74]  This year Thrive staff have provided over 350 unique consultations to churches, helping
[2827.74 --> 2833.14]  them to address needs and opportunities within their own local ministry contexts.
[2833.14 --> 2838.90]  Calvin Seminary is offering some new creative approaches to raising up new leaders, including
[2838.90 --> 2844.42]  Empower, a creative mentor-based method for obtaining a ministry degree happening right
[2844.42 --> 2846.24]  here in Canada.
[2846.24 --> 2851.34]  We also have Canadian-specific justice ministries, such as our Indigenous ministry which has
[2851.34 --> 2857.00]  continued the journey toward reconciliation with over 500 people across Canada through
[2857.00 --> 2858.80]  Hearts Exchanged.
[2858.80 --> 2864.06]  Our intercultural ministry has walked alongside 13 churches last year as they seek to be healthy
[2864.06 --> 2867.18]  multicultural expressions of the gospel.
[2867.18 --> 2872.42]  The Center for Public Dialogue continues to equip churches to engage as faithful participants
[2872.42 --> 2874.82]  in our national community.
[2874.82 --> 2880.08]  And as always, the denominational offices are ready to answer your questions about church
[2880.08 --> 2884.38]  benefit plans, pension funds, insurance, and plan giving.
[2884.38 --> 2886.66]  All of those interesting things.
[2886.66 --> 2892.58]  The One Click, One Call team answered over 12,900 of your phone calls this year.
[2892.58 --> 2898.06]  Thank you for your financial support that helps your church be poised to share the gospel and
[2898.06 --> 2904.72]  for the ways that we collaborate together for Kingdom Impact.
[2904.72 --> 2919.66]  Wonderful update from the office in Burlington.
[2920.26 --> 2925.12]  At this time, I'm going to invite the kids, I think anywhere from age three up to grade four,
[2925.12 --> 2927.90]  but really kids of any age, you're welcome to join me at the front.
[2928.38 --> 2932.20]  We have a little Kids Corner message before we go to children's worship time.
[2932.20 --> 2939.20]  Come on up.
[2939.20 --> 2942.34]  It's been a few weeks since I've had a chance to hang out with you guys.
[2942.34 --> 2944.34]  How's everyone doing?
[2944.34 --> 2945.34]  Good?
[2945.34 --> 2946.34]  Good.
[2946.34 --> 2947.96]  You seem a little distri...
[2947.96 --> 2948.96]  Oh, hi, Kev.
[2948.96 --> 2949.46]  Hi.
[2949.46 --> 2950.46]  Oh, you're just checking something?
[2950.46 --> 2951.46]  Yeah, just looking at...
[2951.46 --> 2952.46]  Okay, yeah.
[2952.46 --> 2953.46]  Oh, anyway, you guys...
[2953.46 --> 2954.46]  Okay.
[2954.46 --> 2955.46]  We'll just keep focusing here.
[2955.46 --> 2957.46]  So, we have a tricky message to...
[2957.46 --> 2958.46]  Oh, hey.
[2958.46 --> 2959.46]  Sorry.
[2959.46 --> 2960.46]  Sorry, you have a nice shirt.
[2960.46 --> 2961.46]  Oh, thanks.
[2961.46 --> 2962.46]  Sorry, you have a nice shirt.
[2962.46 --> 2963.46]  Sorry, you have a nice shirt.
[2963.46 --> 2964.46]  Oh, thanks.
[2964.46 --> 2965.46]  Yeah?
[2965.46 --> 2966.46]  Okay.
[2966.46 --> 2970.46]  Anyway, we're going to talk about a special message today.
[2970.46 --> 2974.46]  I feel like we're not focused here, guys.
[2974.46 --> 2976.46]  Oh, okay.
[2976.46 --> 2977.46]  Oof.
[2977.46 --> 2978.46]  Okay.
[2978.46 --> 2987.90]  Today, we're going to try and talk about a Bible verse from the book of Philippians.
[2987.90 --> 2989.66]  What just happened there with Kev?
[2989.66 --> 2993.00]  Were we paying attention with Pastor Kevin?
[2993.00 --> 2996.78]  Is it hard sometimes to, like, really focus on stuff?
[2996.78 --> 3000.66]  Sometimes there's so many distractions that pull us upside.
[3000.66 --> 3002.14]  He was sneaking up on me.
[3002.14 --> 3003.14]  What?
[3003.14 --> 3006.88]  I think sometimes there's lots of things in our lives that sneak up on us when we're
[3006.88 --> 3009.00]  supposed to be focusing on other things.
[3009.00 --> 3014.52]  So we're going to talk about a verse in Philippians today on how to help us focus on
[3014.52 --> 3019.06]  the things God wants us to focus on and try and try and not be so distracted and try to
[3019.06 --> 3021.86]  help one another focus on those things.
[3021.86 --> 3023.52]  So don't worry.
[3023.52 --> 3025.34]  Pastor Kevin's really not that crazy.
[3025.34 --> 3027.40]  He was just put up to it by me.
[3027.40 --> 3028.40]  So, okay.
[3028.40 --> 3032.06]  We're going to talk more about that and talk about ways to help live through some of those
[3032.06 --> 3033.46]  distractions and support one another.
[3033.46 --> 3038.84]  But before that, we're going to bless the congregation as they stay and also talk about
[3038.84 --> 3040.70]  a verse in the book of Philippians.
[3040.70 --> 3042.92]  And we will also do the same in children's worship time.
[3042.92 --> 3046.88]  So let's stand together with the congregation and we'll bless them and I think they will
[3046.88 --> 3047.94]  bless us in return.
[3047.94 --> 3048.94]  Ready?
[3048.94 --> 3053.94]  The Lord be with you.
[3053.94 --> 3055.74]  And also with you.
[3070.70 --> 3082.94]  Hi.
[3082.94 --> 3084.94]  My name is Paul.
[3084.94 --> 3088.94]  I'm privileged to be an elder here at this church.
[3088.94 --> 3098.64]  And once I get everything set up here, it's my privilege to lead us in family prayer.
[3099.18 --> 3102.66]  Before that, a couple of notes from council.
[3104.26 --> 3108.88]  We're very grateful for all the people that came out this week to the special general meeting
[3108.88 --> 3117.42]  and for the overwhelming positive response to the motion that was put forward to extend
[3117.42 --> 3125.88]  the call to Kevin and move forward his process there to becoming a full ordained pastor in
[3125.88 --> 3126.52]  the Word of God.
[3126.52 --> 3136.38]  As well as yesterday, a number of us from council, both elders and deacons, were able to go to
[3136.38 --> 3144.28]  a leadership conference in Abbotsford at New Life Church where we learned a lot of things
[3144.28 --> 3148.68]  and were inspired for this new season coming forward.
[3151.46 --> 3153.12]  Let's go to our Father in Heaven.
[3156.52 --> 3168.16]  Father in Heaven, we come to you this morning here in this place as your people to seek you.
[3169.10 --> 3173.34]  And because of your spirit that you sent down to be in us.
[3175.54 --> 3181.26]  And because of that spirit, we see that you made the earth on which we stand.
[3181.26 --> 3187.26]  You made the air which we breathe and the beauty in the sky we stand beneath.
[3187.90 --> 3191.52]  And how awesome and vast your creation is.
[3192.96 --> 3198.60]  How immeasurable is the delicate balance and the detail that we see.
[3198.60 --> 3205.98]  And yet, you chase after us like a shepherd watches his sheep.
[3207.48 --> 3212.10]  You know us by name and pour out grace through your redeeming love.
[3212.10 --> 3218.94]  We sang this morning about your throne beneath the name of names.
[3219.72 --> 3220.98]  That's where you're seated.
[3222.40 --> 3228.34]  Your kingdom is here and the time is getting closer to when you will be revealed to all nations.
[3228.34 --> 3234.62]  It's in that knowledge and it's in knowing you.
[3235.92 --> 3240.56]  And knowing that you are in control of all things that we can have comfort.
[3242.32 --> 3243.20]  Help us.
[3244.58 --> 3251.38]  Help us to put on the full armor of God so that we can take our stand against the devil's schemes.
[3251.38 --> 3259.18]  For our struggle isn't against the flesh and blood, but against rulers and against authorities,
[3259.40 --> 3266.08]  against powers of this dark world, and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.
[3268.84 --> 3274.02]  We can stand here in this place knowing that you are here with us.
[3274.02 --> 3284.32]  Do a great work in each of us by your spirit to make us each day more and more like your son, Jesus Christ.
[3287.28 --> 3292.14]  Thank you for your mercy and grace, for always being there when we need you.
[3293.90 --> 3297.18]  We all come here with individual and personal needs.
[3298.12 --> 3301.10]  Needs that we may not have shared with anyone else.
[3301.10 --> 3315.82]  We thank you for your faithfulness and guidance during our special meeting this week, this past week.
[3316.04 --> 3325.64]  And we thank you for leading our church family to approve the motion of calling Kevin as a pastor of the word.
[3325.64 --> 3333.52]  Lord, we pray you will bless Kevin with wisdom and humility and strength as he moves forward.
[3336.58 --> 3339.94]  We pray for John and the medical attention he's getting.
[3341.40 --> 3345.08]  It can be a long process working to receive the right treatments.
[3345.86 --> 3348.70]  And we pray for strength and patience for John and Greta.
[3349.64 --> 3352.28]  And return to health for John.
[3352.28 --> 3358.94]  We pray once again for Tessa, Jerry's daughter and Eneka's sister.
[3360.40 --> 3363.78]  We thank you for the good news that her lymphoma is in remission.
[3364.84 --> 3369.04]  But now she's found out she will have to go for surgery for a spot on her colon.
[3370.80 --> 3374.46]  Please give Tessa and the family patience and peace during this time.
[3374.46 --> 3381.58]  We also pray for Judy, who needs surgery to remove kidney stones.
[3381.74 --> 3385.64]  We pray that that will go well and she will recover quickly.
[3388.30 --> 3392.48]  We also pray for Ellen and the treatment that she receives for her knees.
[3393.44 --> 3395.44]  We pray that it will be successful.
[3395.44 --> 3402.22]  We thank you for the blessing of marriage.
[3403.16 --> 3406.60]  For Michaela and Caden, the daughter of Harry and Robin.
[3407.02 --> 3410.50]  Lord, we ask that you will bless them in their new life together.
[3414.68 --> 3417.18]  Father, we also pray for this world.
[3417.18 --> 3447.16]  We pray for peace.
[3447.18 --> 3450.78]  Help us to see that you are in control.
[3451.40 --> 3457.18]  And help us to be a light in this dark world so that your kingdom will come soon.
[3459.70 --> 3463.06]  As we begin a new season of ministry at our church,
[3463.76 --> 3471.06]  we ask for your prayers over every ministry, every volunteer and leader.
[3471.06 --> 3476.44]  We pray that you would guide each step.
[3476.44 --> 3481.62]  Strengthen those who serve and open hearts for those who will participate.
[3482.82 --> 3491.14]  May all we do bring glory to your name and build up the body of Christ in love and unity.
[3491.14 --> 3501.80]  We ask that you will now bless the word we are about to hear and pray that you will pour out your spirit on Pastor Chris as he preaches your word here today.
[3503.46 --> 3506.54]  Father, we pray that our eyes would be fixed on Jesus.
[3506.54 --> 3513.02]  We pray that by your spirit, you will bring it into our hearts to believe and to trust in you.
[3514.24 --> 3519.44]  And for all these things, we pray not because we are worthy, but in Jesus' name alone.
[3520.20 --> 3520.54]  Amen.
[3536.54 --> 3545.76]  As we begin this ministry year and season together,
[3546.34 --> 3553.10]  as we reflect really on all the things that God has done among us and is doing among us,
[3553.10 --> 3556.64]  as we anticipate what God might do in our midst,
[3556.64 --> 3559.96]  together and prayerfully,
[3560.32 --> 3568.04]  we wondered about how it is that we might step with confidence and conviction into that future.
[3568.48 --> 3572.90]  And to help us with that and to see that a little bit more clearly,
[3572.90 --> 3575.48]  we're going to read from Philippians 1.
[3576.66 --> 3580.86]  I'm going to read from 27 to 30,
[3581.06 --> 3585.20]  although we'll focus on a couple of the verses in there in particular.
[3586.64 --> 3590.28]  You may have also noted, as Mike was up here talking,
[3590.68 --> 3593.08]  the Children's Worship Time kids are doing the same thing.
[3593.60 --> 3595.48]  And so for this ministry season,
[3596.04 --> 3598.66]  Children's Worship Time coordinators and teachers
[3598.66 --> 3604.32]  are going to be matching in their class and in their work what we talk about here.
[3605.16 --> 3608.12]  And so families, no matter how old you are,
[3608.20 --> 3610.90]  you can take these conversations home with you
[3610.90 --> 3613.84]  and over lunch or dinner or whatever throughout the week,
[3613.84 --> 3618.08]  ask how it is that they were learning the same things that you are,
[3618.16 --> 3619.68]  that we are when we stay here.
[3619.96 --> 3623.34]  And so I really encourage that and thank you to the Children's Worship Time people
[3623.34 --> 3625.70]  who have taken that on and made that a priority.
[3626.54 --> 3629.90]  Let's read together from Philippians 1.
[3630.44 --> 3631.78]  I'll start at verse 27.
[3631.78 --> 3640.00]  Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ.
[3641.06 --> 3646.18]  Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence,
[3646.54 --> 3650.50]  I will know that you stand firm in the one Spirit,
[3651.36 --> 3654.88]  striving together as one for the faith of the gospel,
[3655.38 --> 3658.78]  without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you.
[3658.78 --> 3664.18]  This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed,
[3664.66 --> 3668.52]  but that you will be saved, and that by God.
[3669.46 --> 3673.54]  For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ,
[3673.64 --> 3678.76]  not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him.
[3679.90 --> 3683.16]  Since you are going through the same struggles you saw I had,
[3683.42 --> 3686.66]  and now hear that I still have.
[3686.66 --> 3688.74]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3693.38 --> 3697.64]  I don't know if this happens in your world as well,
[3697.74 --> 3704.00]  but a few months ago, kind of in the end of July season of life,
[3704.34 --> 3705.90]  on social media,
[3706.50 --> 3714.40]  the same sort of messaging starts to circulate and come through everywhere.
[3714.40 --> 3718.28]  And I remember, I don't know if it was on Instagram or YouTube or wherever it was,
[3718.36 --> 3719.72]  but there was a clip,
[3720.28 --> 3726.56]  or there was a video showing a bunch of clips of high school commencement addresses.
[3728.34 --> 3733.52]  And every valedictorian or class historian or whomever,
[3733.96 --> 3736.80]  just one after the other, it was clipped together
[3736.80 --> 3738.82]  with words like,
[3739.02 --> 3740.06]  do what you love.
[3741.02 --> 3742.48]  Don't settle for the mediocre.
[3743.12 --> 3744.12]  Make your own meaning.
[3744.62 --> 3745.84]  Find your own way.
[3746.12 --> 3747.68]  And then over and over and over again,
[3747.82 --> 3750.64]  find your purpose.
[3752.16 --> 3753.70]  Find your purpose.
[3753.70 --> 3759.78]  As I was reflecting in preparation for this week,
[3760.68 --> 3765.64]  I came across an article that was written in August this past year
[3765.64 --> 3767.48]  by Alina Tuggan.
[3767.62 --> 3769.52]  It was written for the Associated Press.
[3770.16 --> 3771.34]  And the article was called,
[3771.84 --> 3776.56]  Why the Search for Meaning Can Cause Purpose Anxiety.
[3776.56 --> 3783.16]  In that article, she writes that the word purpose has become so weighty,
[3783.54 --> 3785.04]  so ubiquitous,
[3785.24 --> 3789.22]  from valedictorian addresses all the way through to our social media feeds,
[3789.52 --> 3794.70]  that it's become so weighty that it can be actually a source of angst.
[3796.44 --> 3797.46]  And in her article,
[3797.62 --> 3803.22]  she went on to talk about how psychologists actually have developed a term for this angst.
[3803.68 --> 3805.66]  It's called purpose anxiety.
[3807.52 --> 3810.10]  Part of the problem that was noted in the article
[3810.10 --> 3815.88]  is that a lot of the places that we have historically gone to find meaning
[3815.88 --> 3817.20]  are falling away.
[3818.84 --> 3821.34]  It used to be the case that for many people,
[3821.52 --> 3825.94]  religion and religious connection was a source of meaning.
[3826.32 --> 3830.46]  But in the Western world, anyway, those numbers are dropping.
[3831.76 --> 3836.04]  It used to be the case that people would traditionally find meaning
[3836.04 --> 3841.94]  or purpose in ensuring that their children had a better life than they did.
[3843.08 --> 3845.48]  But two competing realities here.
[3845.58 --> 3848.66]  One, people are having fewer and fewer children
[3848.66 --> 3850.68]  or not having any children at all.
[3850.90 --> 3855.64]  And those children, for the first time in like 200 years,
[3856.06 --> 3858.50]  this generation that's coming up doesn't actually believe
[3858.50 --> 3861.44]  that they will have a better life than their parents did.
[3862.04 --> 3865.28]  That changes the dynamic.
[3865.28 --> 3867.32]  Right?
[3867.36 --> 3871.80]  And as these traditional sources of purpose and meaning wane,
[3872.20 --> 3876.54]  anxiety rises among a population that's trying to figure it out.
[3877.98 --> 3881.30]  One psychologist quoted in the article says,
[3881.30 --> 3885.96]  Now we're stuck trying to do the harder thing,
[3886.34 --> 3888.18]  which is one by one,
[3888.52 --> 3890.58]  figure out everything in the universe
[3890.58 --> 3892.18]  and how we fit in it.
[3893.78 --> 3894.32]  Right?
[3894.36 --> 3896.90]  That's the pressure people are living in.
[3897.48 --> 3898.72]  We have to figure it out.
[3898.84 --> 3900.42]  One by one by one,
[3900.42 --> 3903.56]  every man, woman and other for themselves.
[3904.44 --> 3905.70]  We have to figure out everything.
[3906.88 --> 3911.16]  And we have to decide how it is that we uniquely fit in this place.
[3912.38 --> 3914.50]  And really, I don't know if you feel it,
[3914.66 --> 3915.28]  I feel it,
[3915.50 --> 3920.56]  the deck is stacked against us.
[3921.20 --> 3923.68]  Even language is stacked against us at this point.
[3924.78 --> 3926.28]  And I'm sure you feel it.
[3926.66 --> 3926.80]  Right?
[3926.86 --> 3929.32]  Whether it's through social media algorithms
[3929.32 --> 3931.86]  deepening the doom spiral scrolling.
[3931.86 --> 3933.68]  Right?
[3933.72 --> 3935.80]  Whether it's the powers and principalities
[3935.80 --> 3937.72]  or the state of the world.
[3937.86 --> 3940.66]  Whether it's the unseen spiritual warfare
[3940.66 --> 3942.46]  that we are in the midst of.
[3942.54 --> 3944.28]  And I'm going to be candid and bold with you.
[3944.50 --> 3946.52]  It is actually all three of those things
[3946.52 --> 3947.74]  happening at the same time.
[3949.08 --> 3949.52]  Right?
[3949.60 --> 3952.26]  There's algorithms that are dictating what you see.
[3952.78 --> 3954.38]  There are powers and principalities
[3954.38 --> 3956.50]  and states of the world that are against us.
[3956.58 --> 3958.42]  And there is a spiritual war
[3958.42 --> 3959.72]  that is going on for your hearts,
[3960.12 --> 3961.30]  minds, and imaginations.
[3961.86 --> 3964.76]  And in the midst of that,
[3964.86 --> 3966.62]  we keep hearing the same message.
[3968.14 --> 3970.06]  Find meaning in things.
[3970.50 --> 3972.36]  Find purpose in titles.
[3972.84 --> 3976.02]  Find it in likes and in clicks.
[3976.48 --> 3978.74]  Find meaning in money or in toys
[3978.74 --> 3980.60]  or in status or influence.
[3980.60 --> 3984.34]  And if you can't find what you're looking for
[3984.34 --> 3985.64]  in those things,
[3986.76 --> 3991.68]  well, we are given a palpable distraction
[3991.68 --> 3993.82]  to numb the anxiety,
[3994.08 --> 3995.48]  to quiet the loss,
[3995.70 --> 3996.76]  and to soften the hurt.
[3996.76 --> 4003.88]  If the message isn't the rat race of go, do, do, do,
[4003.88 --> 4006.56]  it's a distraction buffet
[4006.56 --> 4009.60]  where we get to choose from a number
[4009.60 --> 4013.08]  of platters of numbing agents
[4013.08 --> 4017.32]  that the growing void in our hearts and minds
[4017.32 --> 4018.14]  try to fill.
[4018.14 --> 4021.56]  Or to put it another way,
[4021.56 --> 4026.00]  comfort, autonomy, and peace of mind
[4026.00 --> 4028.34]  are the gods of this age.
[4028.34 --> 4031.64]  And they're calling for our attention.
[4031.64 --> 4035.74]  But what if,
[4036.24 --> 4041.12]  what if the longing that's underneath all of that,
[4042.00 --> 4044.74]  right, the truth that purpose anxiety
[4044.74 --> 4046.06]  actually exposes,
[4046.64 --> 4048.30]  is the sense,
[4048.86 --> 4049.60]  the reality,
[4049.60 --> 4052.04]  that we were made for something more.
[4053.04 --> 4054.26]  Something eternal.
[4054.26 --> 4055.52]  Right?
[4055.62 --> 4057.68]  That something beyond us
[4057.68 --> 4060.36]  is necessary for the meaning
[4060.36 --> 4061.98]  that comes out of us
[4061.98 --> 4064.24]  and is found around us.
[4064.58 --> 4066.38]  Something that will not disappoint.
[4066.72 --> 4069.60]  Something that our souls are made to connect with.
[4070.00 --> 4073.96]  What if the call to strive together
[4073.96 --> 4076.54]  as one for the faith of the gospel,
[4077.20 --> 4079.82]  what if the call to conduct ourselves
[4079.82 --> 4081.74]  in a manner worthy of Christ's name,
[4081.98 --> 4083.62]  even when it costs us,
[4083.62 --> 4085.84]  is our purpose?
[4087.50 --> 4090.20]  What if there is the meaning and purpose
[4090.20 --> 4093.38]  that we find in striving and suffering
[4093.38 --> 4095.60]  with Christ
[4095.60 --> 4099.48]  is actually where you can find wholeness?
[4100.32 --> 4102.94]  What if that's the point of all of this?
[4104.32 --> 4105.84]  And if that's true,
[4108.42 --> 4111.94]  what if we've settled for distractions
[4111.94 --> 4113.82]  in place of it?
[4116.70 --> 4118.56]  Today, as we kick off this
[4118.56 --> 4120.04]  ministry and mission year,
[4120.20 --> 4121.48]  I want us to look fresh
[4121.48 --> 4122.44]  at what it means
[4122.44 --> 4125.70]  to live a life worthy of the gospel,
[4125.94 --> 4127.42]  to stand firm
[4127.42 --> 4130.06]  and to be undetured by opposition,
[4130.32 --> 4133.22]  to find meaning in Christ
[4133.22 --> 4134.94]  and to find there the meaning
[4134.94 --> 4137.38]  that our hearts long for.
[4137.38 --> 4141.80]  Our big idea, as it were, this morning,
[4142.20 --> 4143.82]  our theme, the banner under which
[4143.82 --> 4145.36]  we're going to dig today
[4145.36 --> 4146.84]  is that in Christ
[4146.84 --> 4149.66]  is the meaning our hearts long for.
[4150.72 --> 4151.60]  It's that simple.
[4152.02 --> 4153.30]  In Christ is the meaning
[4153.30 --> 4154.64]  that our hearts long for.
[4154.76 --> 4157.20]  That's why and how we live a life
[4157.20 --> 4158.46]  worthy of the gospel.
[4158.60 --> 4160.92]  How and why we stand firm together
[4160.92 --> 4162.40]  in the face of opposition
[4162.40 --> 4164.00]  and challenge from the world
[4164.00 --> 4166.26]  and, honestly, challenge from our own hearts.
[4166.26 --> 4172.28]  Now, we're not the first people
[4172.28 --> 4173.82]  to feel this kind of pressure,
[4173.96 --> 4175.26]  although perhaps we feel it uniquely
[4175.26 --> 4177.08]  in our world today, right?
[4177.12 --> 4178.26]  To feel pulled by a hundred
[4178.26 --> 4179.04]  different directions
[4179.04 --> 4180.16]  of competing voices,
[4180.58 --> 4181.90]  promising meaning and comfort
[4181.90 --> 4182.68]  and identity.
[4183.20 --> 4185.40]  The Philippians knew this as well.
[4186.88 --> 4187.90]  The Philippian church
[4187.90 --> 4190.26]  is a small-ish group of Christians
[4190.80 --> 4192.28]  living in community
[4192.28 --> 4194.94]  in the proud Roman colony
[4194.94 --> 4196.28]  of Philippi.
[4197.76 --> 4198.58]  Now, Philippi
[4198.58 --> 4200.24]  is a city
[4200.24 --> 4202.02]  established
[4202.02 --> 4204.04]  and populated
[4204.04 --> 4206.46]  by retired soldiers
[4206.46 --> 4208.28]  and people
[4208.28 --> 4209.42]  who have been granted
[4209.42 --> 4210.78]  Roman citizenship
[4210.78 --> 4212.16]  as a reward
[4212.16 --> 4214.12]  for their loyalty to Caesar.
[4215.28 --> 4216.28]  Roman culture
[4216.80 --> 4218.72]  offers its own version
[4218.72 --> 4219.64]  of the good life,
[4219.74 --> 4221.14]  about what peace is,
[4221.14 --> 4222.92]  of how to get prosperity
[4222.92 --> 4224.16]  and security
[4224.16 --> 4226.16]  under the lordship
[4226.16 --> 4227.26]  of Caesar.
[4227.26 --> 4231.64]  and those promises
[4231.64 --> 4232.88]  and realities
[4232.88 --> 4234.02]  weren't available
[4234.02 --> 4234.84]  to everyone.
[4237.04 --> 4237.66]  Right?
[4237.70 --> 4238.64]  The Roman Empire,
[4239.12 --> 4241.22]  by its grace,
[4241.50 --> 4242.58]  dispensed that
[4242.58 --> 4243.68]  to citizens
[4243.68 --> 4244.78]  who had earned it
[4244.78 --> 4246.12]  and Philippi
[4246.12 --> 4246.96]  is a colony
[4246.96 --> 4248.40]  made up of those.
[4248.82 --> 4249.18]  And,
[4249.24 --> 4250.34]  in the Roman Empire,
[4250.76 --> 4252.08]  when you didn't quite
[4252.08 --> 4253.10]  get that,
[4253.18 --> 4254.04]  when you didn't have
[4254.04 --> 4254.78]  that reward,
[4254.78 --> 4256.40]  the Roman Empire
[4256.40 --> 4257.58]  was expert
[4257.58 --> 4259.16]  at distraction
[4259.16 --> 4260.74]  and spectacle
[4260.74 --> 4262.00]  to turn your eyes
[4262.00 --> 4262.62]  away from it.
[4264.24 --> 4265.26]  And it's into
[4265.26 --> 4266.26]  that particular
[4266.26 --> 4268.74]  cultural pressure cooker,
[4269.18 --> 4269.42]  right,
[4269.46 --> 4270.44]  with its conflicting
[4270.44 --> 4271.30]  loyalties
[4271.30 --> 4272.70]  and public opposition
[4272.70 --> 4273.88]  that Paul
[4273.88 --> 4275.02]  writes to the church.
[4276.32 --> 4277.46]  And it's worth noting
[4277.46 --> 4278.08]  that Paul
[4278.08 --> 4279.32]  writes this letter
[4279.32 --> 4280.26]  while he himself
[4280.26 --> 4281.78]  is in a Roman prison.
[4281.78 --> 4284.60]  And he says,
[4284.74 --> 4285.58]  whatever happens,
[4285.80 --> 4286.66]  conduct yourselves
[4286.66 --> 4287.28]  in a manner
[4287.28 --> 4288.60]  worthy of the gospel
[4288.60 --> 4289.20]  of Christ.
[4289.74 --> 4289.96]  Then,
[4290.06 --> 4290.80]  whether I come
[4290.80 --> 4291.78]  and see you
[4291.78 --> 4292.86]  or only hear about you
[4292.86 --> 4293.46]  in my absence,
[4293.62 --> 4294.60]  I will know
[4294.60 --> 4295.58]  that you stand
[4295.58 --> 4297.24]  firm in the one spirit,
[4297.92 --> 4298.94]  striving together,
[4299.44 --> 4301.86]  striving together
[4301.86 --> 4302.40]  as one
[4302.40 --> 4303.02]  for the faith
[4303.02 --> 4303.72]  of the gospel
[4303.72 --> 4305.16]  without being frightened
[4305.16 --> 4306.30]  in any way
[4306.30 --> 4307.96]  by those who oppose you.
[4309.48 --> 4310.36]  If you were to start
[4310.36 --> 4310.94]  at the beginning
[4310.94 --> 4311.62]  of Philippians
[4311.62 --> 4312.24]  and read
[4312.24 --> 4314.26]  into our text,
[4314.40 --> 4314.84]  you would see
[4314.84 --> 4315.42]  that this
[4315.42 --> 4317.56]  is the first command
[4317.56 --> 4318.94]  in the whole letter.
[4320.36 --> 4321.34]  And the key phrase
[4321.34 --> 4322.08]  in it is right
[4322.08 --> 4322.66]  at the start.
[4323.50 --> 4324.70]  Conduct yourselves.
[4326.30 --> 4326.50]  Now,
[4326.54 --> 4326.96]  in Greek,
[4327.08 --> 4327.86]  the word that Paul
[4327.86 --> 4328.66]  is using here
[4328.66 --> 4329.70]  literally means
[4329.70 --> 4331.46]  live as citizens.
[4333.18 --> 4333.48]  Again,
[4333.88 --> 4334.04]  right,
[4334.08 --> 4334.60]  that word
[4334.60 --> 4335.36]  would have landed
[4335.36 --> 4336.44]  with a very particular
[4336.44 --> 4337.30]  force
[4337.30 --> 4338.52]  for people
[4338.52 --> 4339.28]  in Philippi.
[4340.24 --> 4340.44]  Right,
[4340.44 --> 4341.56]  their whole identity
[4341.56 --> 4342.84]  is bound up
[4342.84 --> 4343.60]  with the privilege
[4343.60 --> 4344.64]  of being
[4344.64 --> 4345.78]  a Roman colony.
[4346.58 --> 4347.14]  Bound up
[4347.14 --> 4348.18]  with the privilege
[4348.18 --> 4349.80]  of Roman citizenship
[4349.80 --> 4351.02]  that means security
[4351.02 --> 4351.74]  and status
[4351.74 --> 4352.30]  and a sense
[4352.30 --> 4352.90]  of belonging
[4352.90 --> 4353.60]  into something
[4353.60 --> 4355.04]  bigger than you are.
[4355.16 --> 4355.90]  Paul turns that
[4355.90 --> 4356.38]  on his head
[4356.38 --> 4357.52]  in these first words.
[4359.26 --> 4359.74]  Right,
[4359.78 --> 4360.12]  he says,
[4360.24 --> 4360.60]  in effect,
[4360.96 --> 4362.42]  your truest citizenship
[4362.42 --> 4363.54]  isn't Rome,
[4364.06 --> 4364.82]  it's the kingdom
[4364.82 --> 4365.28]  of heaven.
[4366.46 --> 4367.58]  And so live like it.
[4367.58 --> 4369.96]  Let your public life
[4369.96 --> 4370.88]  as a community
[4370.88 --> 4372.50]  reflect the gospel,
[4373.22 --> 4374.92]  not the empire.
[4376.12 --> 4377.80]  Later in this same letter,
[4377.92 --> 4378.56]  in chapter 3,
[4378.60 --> 4379.04]  verse 20,
[4379.26 --> 4380.26]  he says it explicitly.
[4380.42 --> 4380.66]  He says,
[4380.74 --> 4381.42]  our citizenship
[4381.42 --> 4383.24]  is in heaven.
[4384.64 --> 4385.84]  So it begs the question
[4385.84 --> 4386.48]  for us, right,
[4386.54 --> 4387.64]  what does a life
[4387.64 --> 4389.24]  worthy of the gospel,
[4389.44 --> 4390.74]  what does it look like
[4390.74 --> 4392.64]  to live as citizens
[4392.64 --> 4394.40]  in the kingdom of heaven?
[4394.40 --> 4396.32]  Paul gives us
[4396.32 --> 4397.58]  three marks
[4397.58 --> 4398.42]  right here
[4398.42 --> 4399.84]  in these verses.
[4400.76 --> 4401.40]  First,
[4402.24 --> 4403.40]  it looks like
[4403.40 --> 4404.88]  standing firm
[4404.88 --> 4406.42]  in the one spirit.
[4407.84 --> 4409.32]  Now that standing firm
[4409.32 --> 4411.80]  is a military image
[4411.80 --> 4413.44]  of soldiers
[4413.44 --> 4415.22]  standing together
[4415.22 --> 4416.28]  in one line,
[4416.84 --> 4417.94]  of holding the line.
[4419.40 --> 4419.98]  Right,
[4420.02 --> 4421.34]  and then it also looks
[4421.34 --> 4423.04]  like striving together
[4423.04 --> 4424.70]  as one for the faith
[4424.70 --> 4425.32]  of the gospel.
[4425.60 --> 4426.74]  And that Greek word there
[4426.74 --> 4427.94]  for striving together
[4427.94 --> 4429.50]  is athletic language.
[4429.98 --> 4431.16]  It's like teammates
[4431.16 --> 4431.98]  contending
[4431.98 --> 4433.42]  for the same victory,
[4433.54 --> 4434.54]  for the same prize.
[4435.94 --> 4436.62]  And then third,
[4437.04 --> 4438.14]  it looks like living
[4438.14 --> 4439.58]  without being frightened
[4439.58 --> 4440.66]  in any way.
[4441.44 --> 4442.12]  Now that word,
[4442.46 --> 4442.72]  frightened,
[4443.08 --> 4443.90]  is used
[4443.90 --> 4445.00]  to refer to
[4445.00 --> 4445.76]  a horse
[4445.76 --> 4446.70]  that is startled
[4446.70 --> 4448.32]  and bolts in fear.
[4449.32 --> 4449.42]  Right,
[4449.44 --> 4450.80]  and so gospel-shaped
[4450.80 --> 4451.66]  citizenship
[4451.66 --> 4453.22]  means unity,
[4454.22 --> 4454.70]  courage,
[4455.14 --> 4456.04]  and perseverance
[4456.04 --> 4457.74]  in the face of pressure.
[4458.66 --> 4459.58]  And like athletes
[4459.58 --> 4460.68]  on the same team
[4460.68 --> 4461.36]  or soldiers
[4461.36 --> 4463.00]  who are locking shields,
[4463.36 --> 4464.26]  this isn't about
[4464.26 --> 4465.60]  individual heroics,
[4465.74 --> 4467.84]  this is together language.
[4468.90 --> 4469.02]  Right,
[4469.04 --> 4470.06]  the gospel isn't
[4470.06 --> 4471.14]  being advanced
[4471.14 --> 4472.50]  by isolated believers
[4472.50 --> 4473.28]  chasing after
[4473.28 --> 4474.20]  a private spirituality,
[4474.58 --> 4475.70]  but by a church
[4475.70 --> 4477.20]  standing united,
[4477.76 --> 4478.22]  striving,
[4478.22 --> 4479.62]  and suffering
[4479.62 --> 4480.60]  together.
[4483.68 --> 4484.68]  You can probably
[4484.68 --> 4485.60]  already sense this,
[4486.54 --> 4488.22]  but that kind of unity,
[4488.82 --> 4489.92]  that kind of togetherness
[4489.92 --> 4491.78]  doesn't come naturally.
[4493.66 --> 4493.80]  Right,
[4493.88 --> 4495.08]  in Philippians 4,
[4495.16 --> 4495.98]  at the end of the letter,
[4496.12 --> 4497.92]  Paul actually calls out
[4497.92 --> 4498.66]  two leaders
[4498.66 --> 4499.80]  in the community,
[4500.24 --> 4501.70]  Euodia and Synecdoche,
[4502.28 --> 4503.36]  and these two women
[4503.36 --> 4504.08]  were serving
[4504.08 --> 4504.58]  as leaders
[4504.58 --> 4505.30]  in the community,
[4505.30 --> 4506.80]  and he pleads with them
[4506.80 --> 4508.86]  to be of the same mind
[4508.86 --> 4509.84]  as the Lord.
[4511.06 --> 4511.40]  Again,
[4511.50 --> 4511.84]  like I said,
[4511.88 --> 4513.52]  these aren't fringe figures,
[4513.92 --> 4514.06]  right,
[4514.16 --> 4515.40]  Paul describes them
[4515.40 --> 4516.32]  as contending
[4516.32 --> 4517.34]  at his side
[4517.34 --> 4517.98]  in the cause
[4517.98 --> 4518.56]  of the gospel.
[4518.90 --> 4520.36]  The issue that divides them
[4520.36 --> 4521.18]  isn't trivial,
[4521.64 --> 4522.88]  it's about how to
[4522.88 --> 4523.82]  live a life
[4523.82 --> 4524.74]  worthy of the gospel,
[4524.86 --> 4526.00]  how to conduct yourselves
[4526.00 --> 4526.66]  in a manner
[4526.66 --> 4527.58]  worthy of Christ.
[4527.68 --> 4529.06]  It's about how to contend
[4529.06 --> 4530.16]  for the gospel
[4530.16 --> 4531.70]  in a place like Philippi.
[4531.70 --> 4533.92]  The gospel work
[4533.92 --> 4535.40]  was being hijacked
[4535.40 --> 4536.32]  by distraction
[4536.32 --> 4537.72]  and disagreement.
[4547.56 --> 4548.30]  I've been doing
[4548.30 --> 4549.04]  a lot of reflecting
[4549.04 --> 4549.58]  this summer
[4549.58 --> 4552.40]  on what this means.
[4554.52 --> 4555.32]  Because this sounds
[4555.32 --> 4556.12]  familiar to me.
[4557.66 --> 4558.90]  It can be so easy
[4558.90 --> 4559.52]  for church,
[4560.16 --> 4561.12]  for Christians,
[4561.12 --> 4562.34]  for counsel,
[4562.64 --> 4563.98]  or for denominational
[4563.98 --> 4564.84]  conversations,
[4565.44 --> 4565.56]  right,
[4565.56 --> 4566.66]  it can be so easy
[4566.66 --> 4569.10]  for our work together
[4569.10 --> 4570.98]  to get sidetracked
[4570.98 --> 4572.48]  by lesser agendas.
[4574.04 --> 4574.60]  Right?
[4574.74 --> 4575.94]  And maybe for a time
[4575.94 --> 4576.62]  they're important
[4576.62 --> 4577.90]  and necessary,
[4578.38 --> 4579.62]  but in continuing
[4579.62 --> 4580.44]  to come back
[4580.44 --> 4581.18]  over and over
[4581.18 --> 4581.88]  and over again
[4581.88 --> 4582.38]  to these things,
[4582.54 --> 4583.18]  we're no longer
[4583.18 --> 4584.24]  serving to advance
[4584.24 --> 4584.86]  the gospel,
[4585.20 --> 4586.12]  but we're on our own
[4586.12 --> 4586.88]  hobby horse,
[4587.12 --> 4587.82]  pet project,
[4587.92 --> 4588.58]  or soapbox.
[4588.58 --> 4591.00]  This summer,
[4591.36 --> 4592.86]  I had the chance
[4592.86 --> 4593.98]  to preach
[4593.98 --> 4594.76]  to a group
[4594.76 --> 4596.04]  of CRC pastors
[4596.04 --> 4597.50]  at a convention
[4597.50 --> 4598.56]  that was held
[4598.56 --> 4599.18]  in Ontario.
[4600.16 --> 4600.74]  And to this group
[4600.74 --> 4601.74]  of CRC pastors,
[4602.14 --> 4603.64]  I asked this question.
[4605.52 --> 4606.22]  I said,
[4606.32 --> 4607.44]  what if conversations
[4607.44 --> 4608.74]  about church order
[4608.74 --> 4609.74]  or procedure
[4609.74 --> 4611.46]  or national identity,
[4611.92 --> 4613.06]  for all of their importance,
[4613.30 --> 4614.80]  have become red herrings
[4614.80 --> 4615.70]  pulling us away
[4615.70 --> 4616.68]  from the central mission
[4616.68 --> 4617.22]  of the gospel?
[4618.42 --> 4619.90]  What might it look like
[4619.90 --> 4620.64]  for our churches
[4620.64 --> 4622.12]  to not only be
[4622.12 --> 4623.38]  dogmatically committed
[4623.38 --> 4624.26]  to the content
[4624.26 --> 4625.20]  of the gospel,
[4625.56 --> 4627.72]  but also doggedly committed
[4627.72 --> 4629.06]  to the agenda
[4629.06 --> 4630.26]  of the gospel,
[4630.40 --> 4631.32]  to see lives
[4631.32 --> 4632.10]  and neighborhoods
[4632.10 --> 4634.08]  transformed by Christ?
[4635.52 --> 4636.92]  And that same question
[4636.92 --> 4637.88]  can be asked right here,
[4638.36 --> 4638.82]  right now.
[4640.42 --> 4641.84]  What if we are settling
[4641.84 --> 4643.02]  for distractions
[4643.02 --> 4644.42]  when we should be running
[4644.42 --> 4645.72]  after what the Holy Spirit
[4645.72 --> 4646.20]  is doing?
[4647.88 --> 4648.96]  What if we are settling
[4648.96 --> 4650.76]  for something secondary
[4650.76 --> 4652.22]  when we should be living
[4652.22 --> 4653.18]  a life worthy
[4653.18 --> 4654.34]  of the gospel
[4654.34 --> 4656.64]  as our very contending
[4656.64 --> 4658.22]  for the gospel?
[4660.96 --> 4662.54]  Now, this isn't a new problem.
[4663.32 --> 4664.18]  Very clearly,
[4664.44 --> 4665.24]  Paul's addressing it.
[4666.38 --> 4667.76]  In the second century,
[4668.12 --> 4669.04]  there's a church father.
[4669.18 --> 4670.28]  His name is Irenaeus.
[4670.28 --> 4672.24]  He would actually go on
[4672.24 --> 4673.16]  to argue
[4673.16 --> 4674.58]  that the moral
[4674.58 --> 4676.32]  and spiritual character
[4676.32 --> 4678.24]  of Christian leaders
[4678.24 --> 4680.66]  become itself
[4680.66 --> 4681.70]  unapologetic
[4681.70 --> 4682.60]  for the truth
[4682.60 --> 4683.20]  of the gospel.
[4684.06 --> 4685.46]  He says that
[4685.46 --> 4686.24]  ultimately,
[4686.52 --> 4687.84]  it is holiness,
[4688.30 --> 4689.82]  not head knowledge,
[4690.24 --> 4691.88]  that is the truest test
[4691.88 --> 4692.70]  of Christian belief.
[4692.70 --> 4697.72]  That one cuts me
[4697.72 --> 4698.24]  a little bit.
[4699.92 --> 4700.60]  Holiness,
[4700.92 --> 4701.90]  not head knowledge.
[4702.60 --> 4703.68]  That's the truest test
[4703.68 --> 4704.50]  of Christian belief.
[4707.54 --> 4708.52]  John Owen,
[4708.86 --> 4711.40]  he's a 17th century pastor.
[4712.08 --> 4713.44]  He continues to speak
[4713.44 --> 4714.60]  to pastors.
[4715.32 --> 4715.90]  He says,
[4716.02 --> 4717.16]  a pastor's life
[4717.16 --> 4718.16]  should be vocal.
[4719.26 --> 4720.76]  Sermons must be practiced
[4720.76 --> 4721.92]  as well as preached.
[4722.70 --> 4725.22]  So I share that with you
[4725.22 --> 4726.16]  because I'm putting myself
[4726.16 --> 4726.84]  on blast,
[4726.92 --> 4728.22]  as they say here.
[4729.18 --> 4730.02]  But also,
[4730.18 --> 4730.52]  elders,
[4731.28 --> 4732.70]  deacons in this church,
[4733.04 --> 4733.66]  you are called
[4733.66 --> 4734.98]  to be an example.
[4736.06 --> 4737.46]  As the Apostle Paul says,
[4737.58 --> 4739.02]  follow my example
[4739.02 --> 4739.78]  as I follow
[4739.78 --> 4740.84]  the example of Christ.
[4741.94 --> 4742.82]  To be a leader
[4742.82 --> 4745.26]  is to lead in
[4745.26 --> 4747.42]  living a life
[4747.42 --> 4749.06]  worthy of the calling.
[4749.22 --> 4750.34]  To lead in
[4750.34 --> 4751.00]  contending
[4751.00 --> 4752.34]  for the gospel.
[4752.70 --> 4757.08]  division
[4757.08 --> 4760.02]  and hypocrisy
[4760.02 --> 4762.86]  and mission drift
[4762.86 --> 4765.12]  undermine
[4765.12 --> 4766.72]  the witness
[4766.72 --> 4768.16]  of the gospel
[4768.16 --> 4770.18]  just as much
[4770.18 --> 4771.82]  as false teaching does.
[4771.82 --> 4777.84]  So Paul calls us back.
[4779.14 --> 4780.04]  He calls us back
[4780.04 --> 4780.38]  and he says,
[4780.80 --> 4781.30]  stand firm,
[4781.98 --> 4782.94]  strive together
[4782.94 --> 4784.02]  side by side,
[4784.40 --> 4785.54]  refuse to be
[4785.54 --> 4786.18]  frightened
[4786.18 --> 4787.34]  into silence
[4787.34 --> 4788.60]  or splintered
[4788.60 --> 4789.46]  into factions.
[4789.46 --> 4791.96]  the church's unity
[4791.96 --> 4793.78]  is not a sentimental
[4793.78 --> 4794.68]  extra,
[4795.04 --> 4796.10]  an add-on
[4796.10 --> 4796.78]  that makes us
[4796.78 --> 4797.44]  feel good.
[4797.54 --> 4798.84]  It's part of the witness.
[4800.42 --> 4801.48]  Jesus prayed this
[4801.48 --> 4802.40]  in John 17.
[4802.58 --> 4802.98]  He prayed
[4802.98 --> 4804.16]  and said that
[4804.16 --> 4805.08]  our oneness
[4805.08 --> 4805.74]  in him
[4805.74 --> 4806.52]  was given
[4806.52 --> 4808.12]  so that the world
[4808.12 --> 4809.12]  may believe.
[4809.12 --> 4812.28]  when we contend
[4812.28 --> 4813.16]  together
[4813.16 --> 4814.04]  rather than
[4814.04 --> 4815.32]  against each other
[4815.32 --> 4816.30]  the gospel
[4816.30 --> 4817.22]  shines with
[4817.22 --> 4817.74]  credibility
[4817.74 --> 4819.04]  and power.
[4821.28 --> 4822.08]  Paul isn't just
[4822.08 --> 4823.60]  calling the Philippians
[4823.60 --> 4824.28]  to unity,
[4824.28 --> 4825.04]  right?
[4825.08 --> 4825.80]  He's calling them
[4825.80 --> 4826.62]  to unity
[4826.62 --> 4829.00]  with courage.
[4829.00 --> 4830.56]  They are to
[4830.56 --> 4831.34]  stand firm
[4831.34 --> 4832.34]  in the one spirit
[4832.34 --> 4833.34]  striving together
[4833.34 --> 4834.36]  as one for the
[4834.36 --> 4835.06]  faith of the gospel
[4835.06 --> 4836.18]  without being frightened
[4836.18 --> 4837.58]  in any way
[4837.58 --> 4838.56]  by those who
[4838.56 --> 4839.18]  oppose you.
[4840.54 --> 4841.04]  That phrase,
[4841.12 --> 4841.52]  like we said,
[4841.58 --> 4842.30]  without being frightened
[4842.30 --> 4844.14]  is vivid.
[4845.64 --> 4846.00]  Paul says,
[4846.22 --> 4846.98]  don't be like that.
[4847.18 --> 4848.12]  Don't let opposition
[4848.12 --> 4849.26]  or slander
[4849.26 --> 4850.26]  or suffering
[4850.26 --> 4851.50]  make you scatter,
[4851.82 --> 4852.48]  make you bolt.
[4855.64 --> 4856.94]  The Philippians knew
[4856.94 --> 4858.28]  what this kind of courage
[4858.28 --> 4858.96]  looked like.
[4859.88 --> 4861.50]  Their very first glimpse
[4861.50 --> 4862.02]  of it,
[4862.32 --> 4863.32]  of the gospel
[4863.32 --> 4865.50]  came when Paul
[4865.50 --> 4866.42]  and Silas
[4866.42 --> 4867.06]  were being,
[4868.24 --> 4869.40]  they came as
[4869.40 --> 4870.30]  missionaries there.
[4870.36 --> 4871.04]  You can read about it
[4871.04 --> 4871.88]  in Acts 16
[4871.88 --> 4873.42]  and by the work
[4873.42 --> 4874.24]  that they were doing
[4874.24 --> 4875.20]  they were beaten
[4875.20 --> 4876.46]  and arrested
[4876.46 --> 4877.34]  and thrown
[4877.34 --> 4878.52]  into prison
[4878.52 --> 4879.40]  in Philippi.
[4881.50 --> 4882.56]  And as we read
[4882.56 --> 4883.32]  that story,
[4884.68 --> 4885.66]  Paul and Silas
[4885.66 --> 4886.40]  in prison
[4886.40 --> 4887.96]  at midnight
[4887.96 --> 4890.96]  are singing songs.
[4891.98 --> 4893.52]  They're singing hymns.
[4894.32 --> 4894.96]  They're praying.
[4895.42 --> 4896.62]  They're bearing witness
[4896.62 --> 4897.50]  with joy
[4897.50 --> 4898.98]  and in their doing that
[4898.98 --> 4900.32]  an earthquake happens
[4900.32 --> 4901.68]  and the doors
[4901.68 --> 4902.90]  are thrown open
[4902.90 --> 4904.34]  and the jailer
[4904.34 --> 4905.60]  and his whole household
[4905.60 --> 4906.64]  as a result of this
[4906.64 --> 4907.62]  come to faith
[4907.62 --> 4909.34]  because of the courage
[4909.34 --> 4910.40]  and the joy
[4910.40 --> 4911.50]  that he saw
[4911.50 --> 4912.96]  in these two men
[4912.96 --> 4913.90]  that the empire
[4913.90 --> 4915.28]  just couldn't explain.
[4916.08 --> 4917.28]  That didn't make sense
[4917.28 --> 4918.16]  to his frame
[4918.16 --> 4919.04]  of reference
[4919.04 --> 4919.90]  and seeing the world.
[4920.54 --> 4921.38]  And Paul is writing
[4921.38 --> 4922.16]  out of the same
[4922.16 --> 4922.74]  conviction
[4922.74 --> 4923.54]  now.
[4924.96 --> 4925.26]  That's why
[4925.26 --> 4926.00]  Philippians
[4926.00 --> 4927.18]  is often called
[4927.18 --> 4928.46]  the joy letter
[4928.46 --> 4929.54]  or the rejoicing
[4929.54 --> 4930.22]  letter.
[4931.32 --> 4932.02]  Carl Barth,
[4932.22 --> 4933.06]  the theologian
[4933.06 --> 4934.34]  from the 20th century,
[4934.34 --> 4935.00]  he once said
[4935.00 --> 4936.18]  that joy
[4936.18 --> 4937.40]  in Philippians
[4937.40 --> 4939.06]  is the defiant
[4939.06 --> 4939.82]  nevertheless.
[4941.08 --> 4942.48]  It's a full stop
[4942.48 --> 4943.80]  against the Philippians
[4943.80 --> 4944.70]  anxiety.
[4945.40 --> 4946.66]  That's what we see
[4946.66 --> 4948.16]  in Paul and Silas.
[4948.26 --> 4949.86]  A defiant joy.
[4950.28 --> 4952.28]  A nevertheless joy
[4952.28 --> 4953.32]  even when they're
[4953.32 --> 4954.02]  being bruised
[4954.02 --> 4954.82]  and beaten
[4954.82 --> 4955.78]  and bleeding.
[4956.76 --> 4957.46]  And Paul tells
[4957.46 --> 4958.18]  the Philippians
[4958.18 --> 4959.34]  and he tells us
[4959.86 --> 4962.64]  that this is
[4962.64 --> 4963.56]  for you.
[4964.52 --> 4964.68]  Well,
[4964.98 --> 4965.56]  and then he adds
[4965.56 --> 4966.88]  for it has been
[4966.88 --> 4968.00]  granted to you
[4968.00 --> 4969.14]  on behalf of Christ
[4969.14 --> 4970.30]  not only to believe
[4970.30 --> 4971.06]  in him
[4971.06 --> 4973.34]  but also to suffer
[4973.34 --> 4974.70]  for him.
[4976.16 --> 4976.50]  Did you catch
[4976.50 --> 4977.14]  the language there?
[4977.24 --> 4977.92]  It's really strange.
[4979.04 --> 4980.20]  Granted to you.
[4981.04 --> 4981.92]  It has been granted
[4981.92 --> 4982.72]  to you.
[4983.10 --> 4984.18]  That's gifting
[4984.18 --> 4985.10]  language.
[4986.56 --> 4986.66]  Right?
[4986.72 --> 4987.36]  Paul treats
[4987.36 --> 4988.58]  suffering for Christ
[4988.58 --> 4989.50]  not as a curse,
[4990.32 --> 4991.42]  not as an interruption
[4991.42 --> 4992.46]  to the Christian life,
[4992.64 --> 4994.04]  but as part of the package
[4994.04 --> 4995.52]  for belonging to Jesus.
[4996.36 --> 4997.24]  As a privilege
[4997.24 --> 4999.06]  for being seen
[4999.06 --> 4999.82]  in fellowship
[4999.82 --> 5001.16]  and with the same eyes
[5001.16 --> 5001.84]  that he was seen.
[5002.58 --> 5003.64]  Faith and suffering
[5003.64 --> 5004.76]  come together
[5004.76 --> 5005.98]  because the cross
[5005.98 --> 5007.00]  and resurrection
[5007.00 --> 5008.28]  belong together.
[5010.44 --> 5011.78]  And this is the heartbeat
[5011.78 --> 5013.62]  of the early church
[5013.62 --> 5014.32]  and it's my prayer
[5014.32 --> 5014.80]  that it might
[5014.80 --> 5015.50]  once again
[5015.50 --> 5016.34]  become the heartbeat
[5016.34 --> 5017.94]  of the western church.
[5018.30 --> 5020.04]  Of this church.
[5020.04 --> 5026.82]  early Christians
[5026.82 --> 5028.52]  didn't chase
[5028.52 --> 5029.64]  after suffering
[5029.64 --> 5031.66]  but it came
[5031.66 --> 5032.12]  for them
[5032.12 --> 5033.56]  and when it did
[5033.56 --> 5034.74]  they understood
[5034.74 --> 5036.28]  that this is how
[5036.28 --> 5037.54]  the gospel advances.
[5038.02 --> 5038.56]  This is how
[5038.56 --> 5039.48]  Christ is made
[5039.48 --> 5040.24]  visible
[5040.24 --> 5041.28]  how our lives
[5041.28 --> 5042.24]  are conformed
[5042.24 --> 5042.96]  to his.
[5044.36 --> 5044.70]  And again
[5044.70 --> 5045.86]  if we're honest
[5045.86 --> 5046.36]  right
[5046.36 --> 5046.82]  and I hope
[5046.82 --> 5047.82]  we have the eyes
[5047.82 --> 5048.32]  to see it
[5048.32 --> 5049.20]  this cuts
[5049.20 --> 5050.36]  against the grain
[5050.36 --> 5051.38]  of our culture.
[5053.20 --> 5053.42]  Right?
[5053.46 --> 5053.84]  What did we say
[5053.84 --> 5054.24]  at the beginning?
[5054.70 --> 5054.82]  Right?
[5054.88 --> 5055.60]  That comfort
[5055.60 --> 5056.62]  and safety
[5056.62 --> 5057.82]  and peace of mind
[5057.82 --> 5058.50]  are the idols
[5058.50 --> 5059.64]  of our age.
[5060.22 --> 5060.34]  Right?
[5060.34 --> 5060.90]  That meaning
[5060.90 --> 5061.74]  comes from
[5061.74 --> 5062.64]  control
[5062.64 --> 5063.40]  to ensure
[5063.40 --> 5063.82]  that we
[5063.82 --> 5064.88]  have peace
[5064.88 --> 5065.94]  and security
[5065.94 --> 5067.22]  and that everything
[5067.22 --> 5068.94]  is good.
[5068.94 --> 5071.26]  the gospel
[5071.26 --> 5072.26]  says
[5072.26 --> 5072.84]  there is
[5072.84 --> 5074.12]  real meaning
[5074.12 --> 5075.52]  there's real joy
[5075.52 --> 5077.16]  in losing comfort
[5077.16 --> 5078.90]  in risking safety
[5078.90 --> 5080.74]  in surrendering control
[5080.74 --> 5081.96]  for the sake of Christ
[5081.96 --> 5082.80]  and for his kingdom.
[5083.80 --> 5083.88]  Right?
[5083.90 --> 5084.62]  That's why the apostle
[5084.62 --> 5085.70]  Paul says
[5085.70 --> 5086.88]  we need courage.
[5087.88 --> 5087.96]  Right?
[5088.00 --> 5089.04]  Not because the opposition
[5089.04 --> 5089.90]  isn't real
[5089.90 --> 5091.04]  but because Jesus
[5091.04 --> 5092.04]  is risen
[5092.04 --> 5093.48]  because the tomb
[5093.48 --> 5094.02]  is empty
[5094.02 --> 5094.96]  because his kingdom
[5094.96 --> 5096.12]  is unshakable
[5096.12 --> 5097.54]  and so you can go
[5097.54 --> 5098.68]  with courage.
[5102.68 --> 5103.44]  Now this
[5103.44 --> 5104.80]  call to unity
[5104.80 --> 5106.54]  and courage
[5106.54 --> 5108.22]  they aren't ends
[5108.22 --> 5108.98]  in themselves.
[5110.34 --> 5110.44]  Right?
[5110.48 --> 5111.08]  They exist
[5111.08 --> 5111.74]  together
[5111.74 --> 5112.30]  in the life
[5112.30 --> 5112.78]  of the believer
[5112.78 --> 5113.64]  for something bigger.
[5114.92 --> 5115.12]  Right?
[5115.14 --> 5116.04]  To advance
[5116.04 --> 5116.94]  the gospel.
[5117.50 --> 5117.96]  Paul says
[5117.96 --> 5118.96]  that we are to strive
[5118.96 --> 5119.98]  for the faith
[5119.98 --> 5121.20]  of the gospel.
[5121.40 --> 5121.92]  Everything
[5121.92 --> 5123.28]  in this passage
[5123.28 --> 5124.76]  points us
[5124.76 --> 5125.42]  outward
[5125.42 --> 5126.92]  to mission
[5126.92 --> 5128.24]  to witness
[5128.24 --> 5129.30]  to the world
[5129.30 --> 5130.80]  that God so loves.
[5132.12 --> 5133.16]  Paul models this
[5133.16 --> 5133.38]  right?
[5133.46 --> 5134.64]  Throughout the whole letter.
[5135.08 --> 5135.70]  In chapter 1
[5135.70 --> 5136.42]  he describes
[5136.42 --> 5137.82]  how his imprisonment
[5137.82 --> 5139.26]  has actually served
[5139.26 --> 5140.46]  to advance the gospel.
[5140.60 --> 5141.32]  That's in verse 12.
[5141.78 --> 5142.70]  He goes on to say
[5142.70 --> 5143.84]  that some preach Christ
[5143.84 --> 5144.48]  out of envy
[5144.48 --> 5145.64]  others out of goodwill
[5145.64 --> 5146.58]  but either way
[5146.58 --> 5147.58]  Paul rejoices
[5147.58 --> 5148.34]  because Christ
[5148.34 --> 5149.18]  is being proclaimed.
[5150.18 --> 5150.34]  Right?
[5150.38 --> 5150.94]  He doesn't care
[5150.94 --> 5151.82]  about reputation
[5151.82 --> 5153.12]  he cares about
[5153.12 --> 5154.16]  the gospel's reach.
[5154.16 --> 5156.66]  And later
[5156.66 --> 5157.18]  in the letter
[5157.18 --> 5158.60]  he thanks
[5158.60 --> 5159.40]  the Philippians
[5159.40 --> 5160.82]  for their partnership
[5160.82 --> 5162.70]  in this mission.
[5163.40 --> 5164.04]  Chapter 4
[5164.04 --> 5164.86]  he says
[5164.86 --> 5166.48]  they shared
[5166.48 --> 5167.06]  with me
[5167.06 --> 5167.62]  in the matter
[5167.62 --> 5168.08]  of giving
[5168.08 --> 5168.84]  and receiving
[5168.84 --> 5171.36]  you sent me
[5171.36 --> 5171.78]  aid
[5171.78 --> 5172.32]  again
[5172.32 --> 5173.00]  and again
[5173.00 --> 5173.76]  when I was
[5173.76 --> 5174.12]  in need.
[5174.96 --> 5176.22]  This is remarkable.
[5177.00 --> 5177.90]  A small
[5177.90 --> 5178.66]  persecuted
[5178.66 --> 5179.24]  church
[5179.24 --> 5180.26]  in Philippi
[5180.26 --> 5180.92]  becomes
[5180.92 --> 5181.80]  a hub
[5181.80 --> 5183.12]  of global mission
[5183.12 --> 5184.54]  through its prayers
[5184.54 --> 5185.62]  and generosity
[5185.62 --> 5186.66]  and sending.
[5188.62 --> 5189.22]  So in line
[5189.22 --> 5190.28]  with this same thing
[5190.28 --> 5191.04]  I have a really
[5191.04 --> 5192.38]  important question
[5192.38 --> 5192.88]  for you.
[5194.48 --> 5194.96]  Especially
[5194.96 --> 5196.62]  if you're a young person
[5196.62 --> 5197.70]  here this morning.
[5198.74 --> 5199.36]  Especially if you are
[5199.36 --> 5200.02]  in high school
[5200.02 --> 5200.74]  or if you're
[5200.74 --> 5201.34]  in university
[5201.34 --> 5203.18]  or if you're
[5203.18 --> 5203.84]  in college
[5203.84 --> 5205.54]  or if you're
[5205.54 --> 5206.26]  in a gap year
[5206.26 --> 5207.72]  I want to gather
[5207.72 --> 5208.42]  all of you up
[5208.42 --> 5209.20]  into this question.
[5209.56 --> 5211.16]  Is God calling you
[5211.16 --> 5212.94]  to global mission?
[5216.18 --> 5216.92]  Is he putting
[5216.92 --> 5217.76]  something on your heart
[5217.76 --> 5218.48]  that says
[5218.48 --> 5219.68]  you must go?
[5221.76 --> 5222.64]  Or is God
[5222.64 --> 5223.42]  calling you
[5223.42 --> 5224.86]  to be a pastor?
[5228.62 --> 5229.48]  Is he laying
[5229.48 --> 5230.22]  on your heart
[5230.22 --> 5232.64]  a desire
[5232.64 --> 5234.14]  and a push
[5234.14 --> 5235.66]  and an idea
[5235.66 --> 5236.30]  that you just
[5236.30 --> 5237.16]  can't shake?
[5237.16 --> 5240.14]  you need
[5240.14 --> 5240.78]  to declare
[5240.78 --> 5241.90]  his goodness
[5241.90 --> 5242.98]  to the world.
[5245.26 --> 5245.82]  Now
[5245.82 --> 5247.76]  for all of you
[5247.76 --> 5248.58]  everyone
[5248.58 --> 5249.26]  and I don't
[5249.26 --> 5250.08]  this point
[5250.08 --> 5250.60]  it doesn't matter
[5250.60 --> 5251.64]  how old you are
[5251.64 --> 5252.86]  it matters
[5252.86 --> 5253.74]  that you're here
[5253.74 --> 5256.12]  God
[5256.12 --> 5257.48]  is calling you
[5257.48 --> 5258.66]  to be
[5258.66 --> 5259.64]  a missionary.
[5260.90 --> 5261.58]  Maybe not
[5261.58 --> 5262.22]  a global missionary
[5262.22 --> 5262.74]  and maybe not
[5262.74 --> 5263.36]  a vocational
[5263.36 --> 5264.10]  pastor
[5264.10 --> 5265.04]  but you
[5265.04 --> 5266.78]  as a Christian
[5266.78 --> 5268.04]  are being called
[5268.04 --> 5268.70]  to be
[5268.70 --> 5269.48]  a missionary
[5269.48 --> 5270.72]  a missionary
[5270.72 --> 5271.70]  to your family
[5271.70 --> 5273.00]  if they don't believe
[5273.00 --> 5273.52]  a missionary
[5273.52 --> 5274.42]  to your neighbors
[5274.42 --> 5275.76]  to your co-workers
[5275.76 --> 5277.02]  to your teammates
[5277.02 --> 5278.54]  every single one
[5278.54 --> 5279.14]  of us
[5279.14 --> 5280.26]  is called
[5280.26 --> 5281.40]  to go
[5281.40 --> 5282.34]  with the gospel.
[5282.34 --> 5284.70]  That captures
[5284.70 --> 5285.68]  Paul's heartbeat
[5285.68 --> 5286.88]  in this
[5286.88 --> 5287.76]  passage.
[5289.06 --> 5289.98]  A gospel
[5289.98 --> 5291.16]  first church
[5291.16 --> 5291.98]  is always
[5291.98 --> 5293.38]  looking outward
[5293.38 --> 5295.36]  always discipling
[5295.36 --> 5296.46]  new leaders
[5296.46 --> 5297.38]  sending out
[5297.38 --> 5298.02]  new workers
[5298.02 --> 5299.20]  planting new churches
[5299.20 --> 5299.94]  translating
[5299.94 --> 5300.66]  scriptures
[5300.66 --> 5301.94]  supporting missionaries
[5301.94 --> 5302.46]  locally
[5302.46 --> 5303.36]  globally
[5303.36 --> 5304.48]  anywhere
[5304.48 --> 5306.72]  notice then
[5306.72 --> 5307.40]  the connection
[5307.40 --> 5308.76]  the unity
[5308.76 --> 5309.52]  of the church
[5309.52 --> 5310.18]  and the courage
[5310.18 --> 5310.86]  of the church
[5310.86 --> 5311.92]  fuel
[5311.92 --> 5313.26]  that mission
[5313.26 --> 5316.00]  churches
[5316.00 --> 5316.64]  that get
[5316.64 --> 5317.20]  distracted
[5317.20 --> 5318.06]  by internal
[5318.06 --> 5318.70]  squabbles
[5318.70 --> 5319.34]  lose sight
[5319.34 --> 5320.04]  of the harvest
[5320.04 --> 5322.64]  churches
[5322.64 --> 5324.02]  gripped by fear
[5324.02 --> 5325.38]  hide behind
[5325.38 --> 5326.14]  their walls
[5326.14 --> 5328.74]  churches
[5328.74 --> 5329.44]  that strive
[5329.44 --> 5329.94]  together
[5329.94 --> 5330.70]  as one
[5330.70 --> 5331.56]  unafraid
[5331.56 --> 5332.28]  of opposition
[5332.28 --> 5333.02]  churches
[5333.02 --> 5333.76]  like this
[5333.76 --> 5335.02]  become gospel
[5335.02 --> 5336.30]  outposts
[5336.30 --> 5337.04]  embassies
[5337.04 --> 5337.92]  for the kingdom
[5337.92 --> 5338.64]  of heaven
[5338.64 --> 5339.18]  colonies
[5339.18 --> 5339.80]  of heaven
[5339.80 --> 5340.48]  in a world
[5340.48 --> 5341.18]  longing
[5341.18 --> 5341.80]  for hope
[5341.80 --> 5344.42]  and again
[5344.42 --> 5346.06]  we've seen
[5346.06 --> 5346.98]  this in our
[5346.98 --> 5347.56]  history
[5347.56 --> 5349.02]  as Christians
[5349.02 --> 5350.14]  right
[5350.14 --> 5351.18]  despite persecution
[5351.18 --> 5352.02]  and slander
[5352.02 --> 5353.08]  despite poverty
[5353.08 --> 5354.42]  early Christians
[5354.42 --> 5355.02]  and Christians
[5355.02 --> 5355.76]  around the world
[5355.76 --> 5356.44]  today still
[5356.44 --> 5357.42]  keep sending
[5357.42 --> 5358.12]  missionaries
[5358.12 --> 5358.78]  keep planting
[5358.78 --> 5359.22]  churches
[5359.22 --> 5360.26]  keep copying
[5360.26 --> 5360.82]  scriptures
[5360.82 --> 5361.56]  keep caring
[5361.56 --> 5362.20]  for the sick
[5362.20 --> 5363.02]  rescuing
[5363.02 --> 5363.56]  abandoned
[5363.56 --> 5364.20]  children
[5364.20 --> 5365.10]  welcoming
[5365.10 --> 5366.06]  outsiders
[5366.06 --> 5368.44]  in the age
[5368.44 --> 5369.20]  of the
[5369.20 --> 5369.98]  Philippian
[5369.98 --> 5370.52]  church
[5370.52 --> 5371.22]  pagan
[5371.22 --> 5372.22]  empires
[5372.22 --> 5373.14]  or pagan
[5373.14 --> 5373.82]  emperors
[5373.82 --> 5375.04]  are baffled
[5375.04 --> 5376.12]  by Christian
[5376.12 --> 5376.82]  generosity
[5376.82 --> 5377.98]  and Christian
[5377.98 --> 5378.56]  courage
[5378.56 --> 5380.14]  it doesn't
[5380.14 --> 5380.66]  make sense
[5380.66 --> 5381.12]  to them
[5381.12 --> 5382.56]  but it's
[5382.56 --> 5382.82]  there
[5382.82 --> 5385.86]  and so
[5385.86 --> 5386.34]  Paul is
[5386.34 --> 5386.82]  calling
[5386.82 --> 5387.80]  us
[5387.80 --> 5388.92]  to a
[5388.92 --> 5389.48]  gospel
[5389.48 --> 5390.26]  first
[5390.26 --> 5391.04]  life
[5391.04 --> 5391.68]  together
[5391.68 --> 5394.12]  built on
[5394.12 --> 5394.56]  unity
[5394.56 --> 5395.20]  that keeps
[5395.20 --> 5395.74]  the main
[5395.74 --> 5396.10]  thing
[5396.10 --> 5396.56]  the main
[5396.56 --> 5397.00]  thing
[5397.00 --> 5398.62]  built on
[5398.62 --> 5399.18]  courage
[5399.18 --> 5400.26]  that defies
[5400.26 --> 5400.72]  fear
[5400.72 --> 5401.46]  and opposition
[5401.46 --> 5402.68]  and mission
[5402.68 --> 5403.86]  that turns
[5403.86 --> 5404.46]  outward
[5404.46 --> 5405.86]  with sacrificial
[5405.86 --> 5406.86]  generosity
[5406.86 --> 5408.10]  and witness
[5408.10 --> 5409.32]  because the
[5409.32 --> 5410.10]  gospel isn't
[5410.10 --> 5410.64]  just something
[5410.64 --> 5411.52]  we believe
[5411.52 --> 5412.44]  in here
[5412.44 --> 5413.22]  it's something
[5413.22 --> 5413.98]  we live
[5413.98 --> 5414.70]  and proclaim
[5414.70 --> 5415.48]  together
[5415.48 --> 5416.56]  until the
[5416.56 --> 5417.30]  day of Christ's
[5417.30 --> 5417.64]  return
[5417.64 --> 5421.32]  and to be
[5421.32 --> 5421.74]  sure
[5421.74 --> 5424.38]  this is
[5424.38 --> 5424.96]  spiritual
[5424.96 --> 5425.54]  warfare
[5425.54 --> 5428.44]  but our
[5428.44 --> 5428.98]  weapons
[5428.98 --> 5430.18]  aren't the
[5430.18 --> 5430.66]  weapons of
[5430.66 --> 5431.08]  the world
[5431.08 --> 5433.84]  our truth
[5433.84 --> 5435.00]  isn't
[5435.00 --> 5435.84]  told
[5435.84 --> 5436.60]  and proclaimed
[5436.60 --> 5437.30]  in the same
[5437.30 --> 5438.02]  way that the
[5438.02 --> 5438.84]  world might
[5438.84 --> 5439.56]  do it
[5439.56 --> 5442.18]  the gospel
[5442.18 --> 5443.00]  itself
[5443.00 --> 5444.30]  is offensive
[5444.30 --> 5445.42]  to Greeks
[5445.42 --> 5446.28]  and a stumbling
[5446.28 --> 5446.68]  block
[5446.68 --> 5447.50]  to the Jews
[5447.50 --> 5448.00]  we read
[5448.00 --> 5448.70]  in Corinthians
[5448.70 --> 5449.42]  the gospel
[5449.42 --> 5450.76]  is already
[5450.76 --> 5451.34]  offensive
[5451.34 --> 5452.10]  and so
[5452.10 --> 5453.22]  our lives
[5453.22 --> 5454.52]  should be
[5454.52 --> 5455.12]  sweetness
[5455.12 --> 5458.48]  let the truth
[5458.48 --> 5459.24]  of who Jesus
[5459.24 --> 5459.88]  is and what
[5459.88 --> 5460.60]  he has done
[5460.60 --> 5461.12]  convict
[5461.12 --> 5461.74]  hearts
[5461.74 --> 5462.22]  and let
[5462.22 --> 5463.74]  your life
[5463.74 --> 5465.58]  be sweet
[5465.58 --> 5467.58]  Paul has
[5467.58 --> 5468.10]  called us
[5468.10 --> 5468.56]  to live
[5468.56 --> 5469.08]  a life
[5469.08 --> 5469.62]  worthy
[5469.62 --> 5470.46]  of the
[5470.46 --> 5470.86]  gospel
[5470.86 --> 5471.12]  but
[5471.12 --> 5472.66]  lastly
[5472.66 --> 5473.78]  let's be
[5473.78 --> 5474.10]  clear
[5474.10 --> 5476.00]  this
[5476.00 --> 5476.22]  isn't
[5476.22 --> 5476.44]  about
[5476.44 --> 5476.90]  proving
[5476.90 --> 5477.32]  our
[5477.32 --> 5477.72]  worth
[5477.72 --> 5478.78]  to God
[5478.78 --> 5480.18]  this
[5480.18 --> 5480.40]  isn't
[5480.40 --> 5480.68]  about
[5480.68 --> 5481.78]  this
[5481.78 --> 5482.12]  is
[5482.12 --> 5482.52]  about
[5482.52 --> 5483.00]  living
[5483.00 --> 5483.70]  in a
[5483.70 --> 5484.04]  way
[5484.04 --> 5484.36]  that
[5484.36 --> 5484.96]  fits
[5484.96 --> 5485.86]  in a
[5485.86 --> 5485.98]  way
[5485.98 --> 5486.18]  that
[5486.18 --> 5486.76]  lines
[5486.76 --> 5487.16]  up
[5487.16 --> 5487.48]  in a
[5487.48 --> 5487.62]  way
[5487.62 --> 5487.82]  that
[5487.82 --> 5488.36]  matches
[5488.36 --> 5489.02]  the
[5489.02 --> 5489.38]  gospel
[5489.38 --> 5489.76]  we have
[5489.76 --> 5490.32]  received
[5490.32 --> 5491.02]  with the
[5491.02 --> 5491.46]  Christ
[5491.46 --> 5492.00]  who has
[5492.00 --> 5492.40]  claimed
[5492.40 --> 5492.74]  us
[5492.74 --> 5493.32]  as his
[5493.32 --> 5493.72]  own
[5493.72 --> 5494.88]  right
[5494.88 --> 5495.28]  because the
[5495.28 --> 5495.50]  heart
[5495.50 --> 5495.66]  of
[5495.66 --> 5496.18]  Philippians
[5496.18 --> 5496.62]  isn't
[5496.62 --> 5497.08]  just a
[5497.08 --> 5497.26]  set
[5497.26 --> 5497.50]  of
[5497.50 --> 5498.08]  commands
[5498.08 --> 5498.66]  the
[5498.66 --> 5498.90]  heart
[5498.90 --> 5499.02]  of
[5499.02 --> 5499.10]  the
[5499.10 --> 5499.26]  book
[5499.26 --> 5499.42]  of
[5499.42 --> 5499.90]  Philippians
[5499.90 --> 5500.12]  the
[5500.12 --> 5500.32]  heart
[5500.32 --> 5500.48]  of
[5500.48 --> 5500.82]  all
[5500.82 --> 5501.00]  of
[5501.00 --> 5501.28]  scripture
[5501.28 --> 5501.50]  the
[5501.50 --> 5501.76]  heart
[5501.76 --> 5501.92]  of
[5501.92 --> 5502.06]  the
[5502.06 --> 5502.40]  gospel
[5502.40 --> 5502.58]  the
[5502.58 --> 5502.76]  heart
[5502.76 --> 5502.86]  of
[5502.86 --> 5502.98]  a
[5502.98 --> 5503.28]  Christian
[5503.28 --> 5504.08]  is
[5504.08 --> 5504.62]  a
[5504.62 --> 5505.30]  person
[5505.30 --> 5507.12]  is
[5507.12 --> 5507.52]  Christ
[5507.52 --> 5508.12]  himself
[5508.12 --> 5512.02]  just one
[5512.02 --> 5512.38]  chapter
[5512.38 --> 5513.70]  later
[5513.70 --> 5515.00]  in
[5515.00 --> 5515.50]  Philippians
[5515.50 --> 5515.88]  2
[5515.88 --> 5516.72]  Paul
[5516.72 --> 5517.40]  sings
[5517.40 --> 5517.98]  what
[5517.98 --> 5518.20]  many
[5518.20 --> 5518.42]  have
[5518.42 --> 5518.78]  called
[5518.78 --> 5519.02]  the
[5519.02 --> 5519.34]  great
[5519.34 --> 5519.68]  hymn
[5519.68 --> 5519.92]  of
[5519.92 --> 5520.36]  Christ
[5520.36 --> 5521.44]  and
[5521.44 --> 5521.76]  these
[5521.76 --> 5522.12]  are
[5522.12 --> 5522.74]  perhaps
[5522.74 --> 5523.58]  some
[5523.58 --> 5524.00]  of my
[5524.00 --> 5524.44]  favorite
[5524.44 --> 5524.88]  words
[5524.88 --> 5525.46]  in all
[5525.46 --> 5526.18]  of
[5526.18 --> 5526.54]  scripture
[5526.54 --> 5527.98]  and so
[5527.98 --> 5528.22]  here are
[5528.22 --> 5528.38]  these
[5528.38 --> 5528.72]  words
[5528.72 --> 5530.56]  in your
[5530.56 --> 5531.14]  relationships
[5531.14 --> 5531.74]  with one
[5531.74 --> 5532.06]  another
[5532.06 --> 5532.62]  have the
[5532.62 --> 5533.02]  same
[5533.02 --> 5533.60]  mindset
[5533.60 --> 5533.98]  as
[5533.98 --> 5534.38]  Christ
[5534.38 --> 5534.86]  Jesus
[5534.86 --> 5535.36]  and here's
[5535.36 --> 5535.66]  the hymn
[5535.66 --> 5536.46]  who
[5536.46 --> 5537.86]  being in
[5537.86 --> 5538.22]  very
[5538.22 --> 5538.80]  nature
[5538.80 --> 5539.72]  God
[5539.72 --> 5540.20]  did not
[5540.20 --> 5540.64]  consider
[5540.64 --> 5541.20]  equality
[5541.20 --> 5541.94]  with God
[5541.94 --> 5542.36]  something
[5542.36 --> 5543.04]  to be
[5543.04 --> 5543.38]  used
[5543.38 --> 5543.68]  to his
[5543.68 --> 5544.00]  own
[5544.00 --> 5544.52]  advantage
[5544.52 --> 5545.16]  rather
[5545.16 --> 5545.92]  he made
[5545.92 --> 5546.44]  himself
[5546.44 --> 5546.96]  nothing
[5546.96 --> 5547.84]  by taking
[5547.84 --> 5548.14]  on the
[5548.14 --> 5548.32]  very
[5548.32 --> 5548.80]  nature
[5548.80 --> 5549.48]  of a
[5549.48 --> 5549.76]  servant
[5549.76 --> 5550.18]  being
[5550.18 --> 5550.72]  made
[5550.72 --> 5551.08]  in
[5551.08 --> 5551.64]  human
[5551.64 --> 5552.80]  likeness
[5552.80 --> 5554.34]  and being
[5554.34 --> 5554.74]  found
[5554.74 --> 5555.26]  in appearance
[5555.26 --> 5555.64]  as a
[5555.64 --> 5555.90]  man
[5555.90 --> 5556.70]  he humbled
[5556.70 --> 5557.36]  himself
[5557.36 --> 5558.34]  and became
[5558.34 --> 5559.08]  obedient
[5559.08 --> 5560.32]  to death
[5560.32 --> 5561.04]  even
[5561.04 --> 5561.84]  death
[5561.84 --> 5562.48]  on a
[5562.48 --> 5562.94]  cross
[5562.94 --> 5565.48]  therefore
[5565.48 --> 5567.90]  therefore
[5567.90 --> 5568.56]  God
[5568.56 --> 5569.16]  exalted
[5569.16 --> 5569.66]  him to
[5569.66 --> 5570.12]  the highest
[5570.12 --> 5570.56]  place
[5570.56 --> 5570.98]  and gave
[5570.98 --> 5571.36]  him the
[5571.36 --> 5571.62]  name
[5571.62 --> 5571.94]  that is
[5571.94 --> 5572.24]  above

[5574.28 --> 5574.60]  Jesus
[5574.60 --> 5575.00]  every
[5575.00 --> 5575.34]  knee
[5575.34 --> 5575.74]  should
