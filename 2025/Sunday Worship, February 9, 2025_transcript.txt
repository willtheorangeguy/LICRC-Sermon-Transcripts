[0.00 --> 4.44]  I don't need the money
[4.44 --> 8.64]  I don't want the fame
[8.64 --> 13.76]  I don't want what I can't save with me
[13.76 --> 15.92]  In the rain
[15.92 --> 18.58]  Oh and I don't want to lose my soul
[18.58 --> 21.88]  Chasing out the things that don't leave me
[21.88 --> 24.08]  The journey to you is
[24.08 --> 28.12]  Oh I'm lost in a feeling
[28.12 --> 35.66]  Oh I came from this world
[35.66 --> 39.16]  I go back and eat it
[39.16 --> 41.08]  Ain't gonna be easy
[41.08 --> 43.68]  But at least be true
[43.68 --> 47.04]  I don't want to lose my soul
[47.04 --> 54.92]  I don't want to lose my soul
[54.92 --> 58.10]  Chasing out the things that don't leave me
[58.10 --> 62.26]  I don't want to lose my gaze
[62.26 --> 64.06]  When I meet you face to face
[64.06 --> 65.02]  Well done
[65.02 --> 68.64]  Now I'm running over
[68.64 --> 71.56]  Like the prodigal
[71.56 --> 76.44]  Oh I'm lost in a feeling
[76.44 --> 86.98]  Oh I'm lost in a feeling
[86.98 --> 90.52]  Oh I'm lost in a feeling
[90.52 --> 92.48]  I don't want to lose my soul
[92.48 --> 94.48]  And I'm running over
[94.48 --> 98.64]  Like the particle
[98.64 --> 100.10]  Oh I'm lost in a feeling
[100.10 --> 102.02]  I'm lost in a feeling
[102.02 --> 103.54]  Oh I'm lost in a feeling
[103.54 --> 105.02]  Oh I'm lost in a feel
[105.02 --> 109.34]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, came from this world.
[110.68 --> 112.98]  We're going back to eat it.
[113.20 --> 114.90]  Ain't going to be easy.
[115.78 --> 118.26]  No, please be straight to you.
[118.64 --> 119.92]  I'm going to move.
[122.02 --> 123.18]  Like the particle.
[126.98 --> 128.48]  It is what it is.
[132.52 --> 133.66]  Good morning.
[133.66 --> 135.72]  Good morning, everyone.
[137.02 --> 139.82]  Welcome to worship this morning.
[139.90 --> 142.74]  A special welcome if you are a guest with us.
[142.90 --> 143.68]  My name is Chris.
[144.22 --> 149.52]  And I need to tell you that this morning I woke up and I went to go to my front door.
[149.52 --> 153.18]  And there was this massive chair in front of my front door.
[153.34 --> 154.76]  And I was blocked in.
[155.06 --> 156.60]  And I didn't know what to do.
[159.12 --> 162.36]  And so to explain what that's all about, I'm going to invite Josh to the front.
[162.36 --> 164.42]  And he's going to give you a little thank you.
[164.42 --> 166.08]  Yes.
[169.24 --> 173.68]  So thank you all for supporting the Mexico team at the Mexico dinner.
[174.20 --> 178.98]  We had record profit this year, which was awesome because the desserts were so well.
[179.02 --> 184.06]  And you guys bought, pay way too much for those kind of things.
[184.06 --> 188.58]  I would not buy $400 for a cake that I could just make for free.
[190.90 --> 194.08]  But yes, thank you on behalf of the team for supporting us so well.
[194.60 --> 195.80]  We thank you in our prayers.
[196.70 --> 199.50]  And Chris, it's a really comfortable chair.
[199.50 --> 202.06]  Still hideous though.
[202.34 --> 202.68]  Yes.
[203.64 --> 204.82]  Still hideous though.
[205.08 --> 205.68]  I was, yeah.
[206.86 --> 210.32]  Well, I'll enjoy it for a few days, but then someone's going to get it.
[211.32 --> 214.34]  So if you need a chair, talk to me after service.
[216.10 --> 219.46]  Just a couple more announcements before we get into our worship.
[219.46 --> 231.74]  Following our service together this morning, we are going to, excuse me, we are going to have HCBC and the Heidelberg Catechism Reading Group.
[231.74 --> 236.94]  And so we'll start that around noon-ish, although we'll see how it goes.
[237.28 --> 240.42]  If you're sticking around for that, there is lunch this afternoon.
[240.58 --> 242.74]  And so be mindful of that.
[242.82 --> 247.76]  We'll have some soup and buns and then we'll get in our classes together to go through that.
[249.02 --> 261.02]  On Tuesday night, so this coming Tuesday, February 11, we're hosting what we're calling it a foster family support information evening.
[261.02 --> 276.28]  And so we've got a couple social workers from MCFD and some families who are currently fostering, who are going to share a little bit of stories and circumstances about how we as a community can support people who are doing that.
[276.64 --> 277.50]  So I want to be really clear.
[277.60 --> 284.02]  This isn't necessarily about asking you to become a foster parent, although if you have questions about that, please ask.
[284.34 --> 290.02]  But it's really about how can we support those in our midst who are currently fostering.
[291.02 --> 299.54]  And how can we surround them with community and provide the kinds of things that their families need to do that work well and to the glory of God.
[299.64 --> 304.28]  And so that's on February 11, Tuesday night, here beginning at 730.
[304.28 --> 310.48]  If you have any questions, you can talk to me about that after service or Brenda will also take your questions there.
[310.48 --> 335.50]  And then lastly, just a quick note that on February 22, that's coldest night of the year where we're going to have a group of people get together and walk with Gateway of Hope in support of the homeless and addicted populations that need help and support, especially during these cold winter and wet seasons of life.
[335.50 --> 339.76]  And so if you want to participate in that, you can sign up to join the team.
[340.04 --> 342.78]  That information is available online and in the e-bulletins.
[344.46 --> 345.16]  Excuse me.
[345.28 --> 352.84]  And if you would like to support that work, you can also find a link in the e-bulletin there and you can make a donation in support of that work together.
[353.30 --> 357.10]  If you have any questions about that, you can talk to myself or Nikki.
[357.24 --> 359.32]  We'll gladly answer those questions for you too.
[359.32 --> 366.44]  Let's stand together and we might be ushered into God's presence this morning for worship.
[370.78 --> 375.72]  After the greeting of God, invite you to turn to those around you and to welcome them.
[376.18 --> 377.90]  You can hear it in my voice.
[378.02 --> 381.04]  It's cough and cold season and so maybe people don't want to shake hands.
[381.94 --> 385.00]  Maybe they definitely don't want to hug or greet each other with a holy kiss.
[385.46 --> 386.44]  And so a head nod is good.
[386.96 --> 387.60]  Words are better.
[387.60 --> 392.46]  But just welcome each other into the presence of God after we receive his greeting together.
[392.58 --> 394.18]  Receive the greeting of our God.
[395.48 --> 399.90]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father.
[400.28 --> 402.74]  From the Lord Jesus Christ, Son and our Savior.
[403.40 --> 405.86]  Through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[406.74 --> 407.18]  Amen.
[407.18 --> 407.26]  Amen.
[417.60 --> 446.24]  Our call to worship this morning is Psalm 100.
[446.24 --> 450.54]  Shout with joy to the Lord, all the earth.
[451.22 --> 452.66]  Worship the Lord with gladness.
[453.02 --> 454.82]  Come before him singing with joy.
[455.82 --> 457.64]  Acknowledge that the Lord is God.
[457.98 --> 459.70]  He made us and we are his.
[460.26 --> 462.60]  We are his people, the sheep of his pasture.
[463.34 --> 466.14]  Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise.
[466.14 --> 469.02]  Give thanks to him and praise his name.
[469.58 --> 470.44]  For the Lord is good.
[470.94 --> 473.28]  His unfailing love continues forever.
[473.70 --> 476.70]  And his faithfulness continues to each generation.
[477.42 --> 481.34]  And with this joy and in this next song, please get your clapping hands ready.
[482.12 --> 484.70]  And if you don't know when to clap, Aaron will let you know.
[484.70 --> 506.88]  We want to see Jesus lifted high.
[506.88 --> 510.60]  A banner that flies across this land.
[510.60 --> 514.26]  That all men might see the truth and know.
[514.88 --> 517.30]  He is the way to heaven.
[517.30 --> 547.08]  He is the way to heaven.
[547.30 --> 555.00]  We want to see, we want to see, we want to see Jesus lifted high.
[555.18 --> 562.38]  We want to see, we want to see, we want to see Jesus lifted high.
[562.82 --> 569.62]  Step by step we're moving forward, little by little we're making ground.
[569.62 --> 579.90]  Every prayer a powerful weapon, strongholds come, tumbling down and down and down and down.
[580.76 --> 587.72]  We want to see, we want to see, we want to see Jesus lifted high.
[588.00 --> 595.06]  We want to see, we want to see, we want to see Jesus lifted high.
[595.06 --> 602.24]  We want to see, we want to see, we want to see Jesus lifted high.
[602.48 --> 608.86]  We want to see, we want to see, we want to see Jesus lifted high.
[608.86 --> 610.08]  My Heart
[638.86 --> 652.10]  Blessed be your name in the land that is plentiful, where the streams of abundance flow.
[652.10 --> 654.64]  Blessed be your name.
[657.08 --> 667.64]  Blessed be your name when you're found in the desert place, when you walk through the wilderness.
[667.64 --> 670.34]  Blessed be your name.
[672.52 --> 679.42]  Every blessing you pour out, I'll turn back to praise.
[680.90 --> 687.02]  When the darkness closes in, Lord, still I will say,
[687.02 --> 690.02]  Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[690.94 --> 693.58]  Blessed be your name.
[693.58 --> 695.58]  Blessed be your name.
[695.58 --> 697.58]  Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[697.58 --> 701.58]  Blessed be your glorious name.
[701.58 --> 703.58]  Blessed be your name.
[703.58 --> 704.58]  Blessed be your name.
[704.58 --> 707.58]  When the sun's shining down on me.
[707.58 --> 709.58]  For the world's all that it should be.
[709.58 --> 710.58]  Blessed be your name.
[710.58 --> 711.58]  Blessed be your name.
[711.58 --> 712.58]  Blessed be your name.
[712.58 --> 715.58]  For the world's all that it should be.
[715.58 --> 717.58]  Blessed be your name.
[717.58 --> 719.58]  Blessed be your name.
[719.58 --> 720.58]  Blessed be your name.
[720.58 --> 722.58]  On the road mark, blessed I'll bring.
[722.58 --> 724.58]  Blessed be your name.
[724.58 --> 726.58]  On the road mark, blessed I'll bring.
[726.58 --> 728.58]  So there's a name in the offering.
[728.58 --> 729.58]  Blessed be your name.
[729.58 --> 731.58]  the offering
[731.58 --> 733.58]  blessed be your name
[734.14 --> 737.80]  every blessing
[737.80 --> 739.66]  you pour out
[739.66 --> 741.88]  I'll turn back to
[741.88 --> 743.66]  praise
[743.66 --> 745.68]  when the darkness
[745.68 --> 747.72]  closes in the Lord
[747.72 --> 749.58]  still I will say
[750.34 --> 751.58]  blessed be the name
[752.22 --> 753.82]  of the Lord
[753.82 --> 755.58]  blessed be your name
[757.18 --> 759.56]  blessed be the name
[759.56 --> 761.42]  of the Lord
[761.42 --> 763.78]  blessed be your glory
[763.78 --> 765.56]  our name
[766.20 --> 769.46]  forgive and
[769.46 --> 771.14]  take away
[771.14 --> 774.02]  forgive and take
[774.02 --> 774.56]  away
[774.56 --> 777.72]  my heart will choose
[777.72 --> 778.76]  to stay
[778.76 --> 781.76]  blessed be your
[781.76 --> 782.88]  reign
[782.88 --> 785.98]  forgive and take away
[785.98 --> 789.54]  forgive and take away
[789.54 --> 792.60]  my heart will choose
[792.60 --> 793.70]  to stay
[793.70 --> 797.54]  blessed be your name
[797.54 --> 802.66]  blessed be the name of the Lord
[802.66 --> 805.54]  blessed be your name
[805.54 --> 810.02]  blessed be the name of the Lord
[810.02 --> 813.44]  blessed be your glorious name
[813.44 --> 817.50]  blessed be your name
[817.50 --> 819.44]  blessed be your name
[819.44 --> 820.44]  blessed be your name
[820.44 --> 825.24]  blessed be the name of the Lord
[825.24 --> 829.44]  blessed be your glorious name
[829.44 --> 844.52]  free and autour of the Lord
[844.52 --> 846.90]  and the Lord
[846.90 --> 847.78]  which you can sit
[847.78 --> 848.88]  if you would like
[848.88 --> 850.84]  it's gonna be a little bit of time
[850.84 --> 861.58]  I had the privilege of going to the Calvin worship symposium at Calvin University in Grand Rapids, Michigan this week.
[862.32 --> 867.86]  And it was beautiful and wonderful to sing with so many incredible people.
[869.68 --> 877.68]  And something that was really beautiful was this song that we were going to sing through our Confession Assurance was sung.
[877.68 --> 882.52]  And I'd already put it in our service and I thought, oh, that's so cool.
[882.62 --> 883.18]  I love that.
[883.54 --> 891.84]  And the way that they did it is we're going to reflect that a little bit in how we engage in this song.
[892.02 --> 901.24]  And so I'm going to do some prayer and then we're going to respond with the song, Lord, listen to your children praying.
[902.16 --> 905.80]  So you can stay with your eyes closed and listen along.
[905.80 --> 907.98]  It's familiar for a lot of us.
[908.40 --> 915.52]  You can open your eyes or just keep along and follow along with us and let us lead.
[916.70 --> 917.56]  Pray with me.
[922.54 --> 923.14]  Lord.
[927.52 --> 930.52]  Gracious God, thank you for who you are.
[931.44 --> 932.92]  We want to see you.
[932.92 --> 938.62]  We want to see your gifts of grace in plenty.
[939.88 --> 948.32]  We want to see and recognize how you have blessed us and look around and see your beautiful creation.
[948.52 --> 951.78]  Open our eyes to your wonder.
[953.78 --> 960.16]  We want to feel you when we walk in the desert place, knowing that you are with us.
[960.16 --> 966.84]  We sing your praises and assure our souls with who you are.
[967.78 --> 969.46]  Open our eyes to your word.
[970.00 --> 971.62]  Open our hearts to your love.
[974.76 --> 975.76]  Lord, listen.
[977.26 --> 979.00]  Listen to us as we pray.
[979.00 --> 990.06]  Lord, listen to your children praying.
[992.74 --> 999.24]  Lord, send your spirit in this place.
[999.24 --> 1005.94]  Lord, listen to your children praying.
[1007.94 --> 1009.84]  Send us love.
[1010.02 --> 1011.74]  Send us power.
[1012.02 --> 1013.94]  Send us grace.
[1013.94 --> 1021.56]  Lord, forgive us.
[1022.56 --> 1024.46]  Forgive us for our sins.
[1027.76 --> 1031.26]  Forgive us for our empty prayers.
[1032.26 --> 1037.26]  When we pray for you to take our sins away, but we don't really mean it.
[1037.26 --> 1038.80]  Forgive us for our sins away.
[1038.80 --> 1039.24]  Forgive us for our sins away.
[1039.24 --> 1039.34]  Forgive us for our sins away.
[1039.34 --> 1041.64]  Forgive us when we lean deeper into the darkness.
[1044.52 --> 1047.02]  It's familiar and easy to hide from you.
[1048.44 --> 1051.08]  We come to church and we praise you.
[1051.86 --> 1054.82]  And we confess our sins communally.
[1055.28 --> 1057.70]  And then we're assured by your presence, Lord.
[1057.70 --> 1061.58]  And then we walk out the doors and go back.
[1062.44 --> 1063.60]  Back into life.
[1064.06 --> 1065.58]  Into our secular living, God.
[1066.94 --> 1068.22]  Forgive us for that.
[1069.12 --> 1070.46]  Forgive us for forgetting you.
[1072.90 --> 1078.68]  We fool ourselves so often that we've got it under control.
[1081.04 --> 1082.34]  But you see us.
[1083.06 --> 1085.80]  You see us in those vulnerable moments, Lord.
[1087.70 --> 1090.48]  And you're calling us back to you.
[1092.40 --> 1094.50]  Lord, listen to us as we pray.
[1094.90 --> 1098.40]  Listen to the yearning in our hearts to surrender to you, Lord.
[1109.40 --> 1113.86]  Lord, listen to your children praying.
[1113.86 --> 1129.56]  Lord, listen to your children praying.
[1129.56 --> 1137.56]  Send us love, send us power, send us grace.
[1137.56 --> 1139.56]  Lord, listen to your children praying.
[1143.56 --> 1147.12]  Lord, forgive us when we forget each other.
[1148.50 --> 1154.40]  Forgive us for being self-centered and only seeing what's right in front of us.
[1157.06 --> 1160.28]  Lord, open our eyes to the people around us.
[1160.66 --> 1163.38]  This community of faith that you have put us in.
[1163.38 --> 1165.38]  Lord, open our hearts.
[1165.38 --> 1166.38]  Lord, open our hearts.
[1166.38 --> 1167.38]  Lord, open our hearts.
[1167.38 --> 1169.68]  Put on our hearts the needs.
[1170.38 --> 1177.48]  Put on our hearts to pray for each other, for our faith, that we may grow and that we may flourish.
[1178.54 --> 1183.60]  Pray that we may see that in each other and encourage and grow each other.
[1183.60 --> 1185.60]  Lord, help us to pray for each other.
[1185.60 --> 1190.40]  Lord, help us look to the world.
[1192.04 --> 1196.50]  Help us see our brothers and sisters in Christ across the globe.
[1198.10 --> 1204.38]  And remind us to pray that we join in unity in worshiping you, Lord.
[1207.46 --> 1209.22]  Hear us as we pray, Lord.
[1209.22 --> 1211.22]  Lord, listen to your children praying.
[1211.22 --> 1228.22]  Lord, send your spirit in this place.
[1228.22 --> 1235.22]  Lord, listen to your children praying.
[1235.22 --> 1265.20]  Lord, listen to your children praying.
[1265.20 --> 1275.20]  Send us love, send us power, send us grace.
[1281.20 --> 1283.96]  Please rise if you are able and sing our assurance.
[1283.96 --> 1284.96]  Amen.
[1286.96 --> 1287.10]  Amen.
[1287.10 --> 1306.80]  I long to breathe the air of heaven
[1306.80 --> 1313.96]  Where pain is gone and mercy kills the streets
[1313.96 --> 1321.46]  To love the God, the one who pled to save me
[1321.46 --> 1326.98]  And walk with him for all eternity
[1326.98 --> 1337.96]  There will be a day when all the love accorded
[1337.96 --> 1345.46]  There will be a day when death will be no more
[1345.46 --> 1353.96]  Standing face to face with he who died and rose again
[1353.96 --> 1359.96]  Holy, holy is our Lord
[1359.96 --> 1369.46]  Every prayer we pray in desperation
[1369.46 --> 1376.96]  A song of faith we sang through doubt and fear
[1376.96 --> 1384.46]  And in the end we'll see that it was worth it
[1384.46 --> 1391.96]  When he returns to wipe away our tears
[1391.96 --> 1400.46]  There will be a day when all will bow before him
[1400.46 --> 1406.96]  There will be a day when death will be no more
[1406.96 --> 1415.46]  Standing face to face with he who died and rose again
[1415.46 --> 1421.46]  Holy, holy is our Lord
[1421.46 --> 1430.46]  And on that day we join the resurrection
[1430.46 --> 1438.46]  And stand beside the heroes of the faith
[1438.46 --> 1444.46]  With one voice a thousand generations
[1444.46 --> 1451.46]  Sing worthy is the Lamb who was played
[1451.46 --> 1458.46]  And on that day we join the resurrection
[1458.46 --> 1465.46]  And stand beside the heroes of the faith
[1465.46 --> 1466.46]  And stand beside the heroes of the faith
[1466.46 --> 1467.46]  And stand beside the heroes of the faith
[1467.46 --> 1469.46]  And stand beside the heroes of the faith
[1469.46 --> 1474.46]  And stand beside the heroes of the命令
[1474.46 --> 1477.46]  Children of the faith
[1477.46 --> 1478.06]  And stand beside the heroes of the faith
[1479.46 --> 1481.46]  And all пап Af'n源
[1486.46 --> 1487.46]  The was you everywhere
[1487.46 --> 1490.46]  That Christ is the earth
[1490.46 --> 1491.46]  And all biblical40ga
[1491.46 --> 1493.46]  And all gods will be no more
[1493.46 --> 1495.32]  For Him
[1495.32 --> 1498.32]  There will be a day
[1498.32 --> 1501.06]  When death will be gone
[1501.06 --> 1504.94]  Standing face to face
[1504.94 --> 1509.84]  With He who I am rose again
[1509.84 --> 1515.56]  Holy, holy is the Lord
[1515.56 --> 1517.72]  Let it be today
[1517.72 --> 1521.06]  We shall live forever
[1521.06 --> 1524.54]  With angels and her saints
[1524.54 --> 1528.20]  Give grace and mighty glory
[1528.20 --> 1531.20]  Glory to our God
[1531.20 --> 1536.18]  Who gave us life beyond the grave
[1536.18 --> 1541.82]  Holy, holy is the Lord
[1541.82 --> 1549.32]  Holy, holy is the Lord
[1549.32 --> 1556.00]  Holy, holy is the Lord
[1556.00 --> 1561.48]  Holy, holy is the Lord
[1561.48 --> 1580.46]  Good morning, my name is Pearl
[1580.46 --> 1582.60]  I'm one of the deacons here at Langley Emanuel
[1582.60 --> 1586.00]  And it's time to continue our worship with our offerings
[1586.00 --> 1588.44]  Today's offering is first for the budget
[1588.44 --> 1590.46]  Which is for the ministries of this church
[1590.46 --> 1591.94]  And if you wish to give to that
[1591.94 --> 1594.70]  Then do it in a marked envelope
[1594.70 --> 1596.74]  Or use the envelopes that are in front of you
[1596.74 --> 1597.88]  And the chairs in front of you
[1597.88 --> 1601.58]  And our other offering for any money that's not designated
[1601.58 --> 1604.22]  Will be for Night Shift Ministries
[1604.22 --> 1610.20]  Night Shift Ministries is a ministry that serves primarily the street people
[1610.20 --> 1614.96]  And they have location, one in the city of Langley
[1614.96 --> 1619.10]  And then also one off of King George Boulevard in Surrey
[1619.10 --> 1623.74]  And in both locations we have teams from this church here that go
[1623.74 --> 1629.98]  The one in Langley, it's a couple of nights a week that there's food being served
[1629.98 --> 1632.42]  And there's volunteers from this church that help serve that
[1632.42 --> 1637.52]  And then the one in Surrey is 365 days of the year
[1637.52 --> 1643.12]  And there not only is there food served on the street there in the parking lot
[1643.12 --> 1646.20]  There's also counselling available there
[1646.20 --> 1649.00]  There's also a clothing truck
[1649.00 --> 1653.00]  There's also prayer that's being offered there
[1653.00 --> 1654.98]  It's a faith-based ministry
[1654.98 --> 1657.74]  It's 100% operated by donations
[1657.74 --> 1659.58]  There's no government funding whatsoever
[1659.58 --> 1667.28]  And as most of you know, I happen to be on the team that is a part of the Surrey group
[1667.28 --> 1670.12]  And so just to give you a bit of a snapshot of what happens there
[1670.12 --> 1671.76]  We were there this past Thursday
[1671.76 --> 1674.46]  And we served, I think it was 89 people
[1674.46 --> 1676.80]  There's always a report that we get through our emails
[1676.80 --> 1682.30]  And I think I read this morning that there were 89 people that we served on the streets of Surrey
[1682.30 --> 1683.84]  This past Thursday
[1683.84 --> 1686.68]  And these people, some of them are homeless
[1686.68 --> 1688.30]  Some of them live in shelters
[1688.30 --> 1689.84]  Some of them have jobs
[1689.84 --> 1693.92]  But just can't afford to both put a roof over their head and feed themselves
[1693.92 --> 1695.68]  So everybody's welcome there
[1695.68 --> 1697.02]  There's no questions asked
[1697.02 --> 1699.88]  And then we made three pots of chili
[1699.88 --> 1701.88]  We always make hot food
[1701.88 --> 1704.88]  So we made three pots of chili and did nine loaves of bread
[1704.88 --> 1708.42]  And all that food is donated by people from this congregation
[1708.42 --> 1712.12]  And then, yeah, we start serving at 7
[1712.12 --> 1713.10]  We prepare it there
[1713.10 --> 1714.18]  We start serving at 7
[1714.18 --> 1715.80]  And then by 8 o'clock it was all gone
[1715.80 --> 1718.54]  And, but that one hour then
[1718.54 --> 1720.64]  There's a lot of fellowship that happens on the streets
[1720.64 --> 1722.18]  So there's a lot of community
[1722.18 --> 1726.28]  A lot of networking amongst the people that are eating together
[1726.28 --> 1728.38]  So it's a real community time
[1728.38 --> 1732.76]  And it's a real ministry that Night Shift offers for all of these people
[1732.76 --> 1734.28]  So do give generously
[1734.28 --> 1738.68]  Even as we've been blessed with such warm homes this week
[1738.68 --> 1740.76]  The people on the streets, of course, are cold
[1740.76 --> 1742.66]  So do give generously this week
[1742.66 --> 1749.00]  And remember their, the Bible verse that Night Shift Ministry operates under is
[1749.00 --> 1750.68]  I was hungry, you gave me food
[1750.68 --> 1752.18]  I was thirsty, you gave me drink
[1752.18 --> 1753.56]  I was naked and you clothed me
[1753.56 --> 1754.30]  Thank you
[1754.30 --> 1778.22]  Holy Spirit, living breath of God
[1778.22 --> 1791.36]  Let the presence of the risen Lord
[1791.36 --> 1797.06]  Come renew my heart and make me old
[1797.06 --> 1804.90]  Cause your word to call the life in me
[1804.90 --> 1811.28]  Give me faith for what I cannot see
[1811.28 --> 1817.08]  Give me passion for your purity
[1817.08 --> 1822.72]  Holy Spirit, bring you my faith
[1822.72 --> 1830.48]  Holy Spirit, come abide with me
[1830.48 --> 1836.48]  May your joy be seen in all I do
[1836.48 --> 1843.40]  Love enough to cover every sin
[1843.40 --> 1848.20]  In each thought and deed and attitude
[1848.20 --> 1856.86]  Kindness to the greatest and the least
[1856.86 --> 1863.20]  Gentleness, bless those, the path of peace
[1863.20 --> 1869.10]  Turn my strides into words of grace
[1869.10 --> 1874.86]  Breath of God, show Christ in all I do
[1874.86 --> 1882.12]  Holy Spirit, from creation's birth
[1882.12 --> 1888.12]  Giving life to all that God has made
[1888.12 --> 1895.16]  Show your power once again on earth
[1895.16 --> 1901.12]  Ask your church to hunger for your grace
[1901.12 --> 1908.56]  Let the great grace of our prayers arise
[1908.56 --> 1914.42]  Lead us on the road of sacrifice
[1914.42 --> 1914.50]  Lead us on the road of sacrifice
[1914.50 --> 1915.28]  Lead us on the road of sacrifice
[1915.28 --> 1920.78]  That in humanity the face of Christ
[1920.78 --> 1926.44]  May be clear for all the world to see
[1926.44 --> 1933.28]  Let the fragrance of our prayers arise
[1933.28 --> 1948.28]  rise, lead us on the road of sacrifice, that in unity the place of Christ may be clear
[1948.28 --> 1953.28]  for all the world to see.
[1963.28 --> 1970.54]  Good morning everyone, I'd like to invite any kids up to the front, age three, up to grade
[1970.54 --> 1976.40]  four, and have a little chat before we head off to our classes for children's worship
[1976.40 --> 1976.78]  today.
[1984.28 --> 1989.46]  I'm wondering if you guys know why you celebrate your birthday.
[1989.46 --> 1994.18]  Why do we celebrate our birthday?
[1994.18 --> 1995.18]  Where does that come from?
[1995.18 --> 2003.48]  What do you think, Mateo?
[2003.48 --> 2007.58]  You might have a cake at your birthday party, you might have like some fun games and some
[2007.58 --> 2011.82]  friends over, but how do you know when to celebrate your birthday?
[2011.82 --> 2015.12]  You just pick your favorite day of the year when it seems like it would be good?
[2015.12 --> 2016.12]  How do you know?
[2016.12 --> 2017.12]  What do you think, Hayley?
[2017.12 --> 2019.56]  Yeah, it's about when you were born, the day you were born.
[2019.56 --> 2023.16]  You probably don't remember the day you were born, but when you were born, you're a little
[2023.16 --> 2026.38]  tiny baby, exactly.
[2026.38 --> 2028.38]  And what do babies do?
[2028.38 --> 2029.38]  Cry.
[2029.38 --> 2030.38]  Cry.
[2030.38 --> 2031.38]  Crawl.
[2031.38 --> 2032.38]  Crawl.
[2032.38 --> 2033.38]  Poop.
[2033.38 --> 2034.38]  Yeah.
[2034.38 --> 2040.44]  They make you go and laugh, but they can't do too much, right?
[2040.44 --> 2044.14]  I'm sure there's things you can think of that you can do now that when you were a baby, you
[2044.14 --> 2051.12]  just couldn't do that yet, like ride a bike or go for a run or play soccer or paint beautiful
[2051.12 --> 2051.52]  pictures.
[2051.52 --> 2057.16]  So today what we're going to talk about is in the Bible, Jesus talks about being born
[2057.16 --> 2057.76]  again.
[2058.18 --> 2062.06]  We were already born when we were a baby, but what does it mean to be born again?
[2062.32 --> 2065.76]  And what does it mean to have the Holy Spirit living in our hearts?
[2065.76 --> 2067.90]  So that's going to be our theme today.
[2068.90 --> 2072.16]  And before we go though, I'd like to invite you to stand or everyone to stand and we'll
[2072.16 --> 2076.00]  do our blessing and receive our blessing and then we'll head off.
[2076.00 --> 2082.14]  The Lord be with you.
[2082.34 --> 2083.92]  And also with you.
[2095.76 --> 2125.74]  Good morning, my friends.
[2125.74 --> 2127.90]  My name is Clary Klosterhof.
[2129.08 --> 2131.14]  I don't know if I'm allowed to use last names.
[2132.14 --> 2133.22]  That's my last name.
[2134.28 --> 2141.76]  And I'm an elder here and I'm going to lead us in our family prayer this morning.
[2143.94 --> 2147.18]  A couple announcements though that won't be in the prayer.
[2147.18 --> 2158.08]  First of all, donation receipts are going to be in your church mailboxes EOD Tuesday, which
[2158.08 --> 2160.96]  apparently is an acronym that stands for end of day.
[2161.52 --> 2166.00]  So end of day Tuesday, your donation receipts are available.
[2166.00 --> 2172.98]  Please contact the church office if you have any questions or need yours mailed out.
[2173.86 --> 2181.96]  And then just as a council, as a congregation, we want to give thanks for the many ways in
[2181.96 --> 2185.90]  which our church family is loving and taking care of each other.
[2185.90 --> 2196.36]  Whether in meals, cards, rides, visits, and prayers, we see God at work among us in our love for each other.
[2196.98 --> 2198.80]  And that's wonderful.
[2198.80 --> 2206.38]  So please join me, join with me as we come to the Father in congregational prayer.
[2208.56 --> 2214.34]  Gracious Father in heaven, again, we want to say thank you for a new day.
[2214.34 --> 2220.98]  And we want to give you thanks that we can begin our work weeks with a day of rest.
[2221.62 --> 2237.86]  And we can put away maybe the mundane details of making a living and being busy and begin the week with an act of faith
[2237.86 --> 2249.46]  where we don't work and we can begin our day all together glorifying you, being blessed by your presence,
[2249.80 --> 2253.08]  and this morning celebrating the feast of your table.
[2254.36 --> 2255.58]  Thank you for this.
[2257.22 --> 2261.58]  And thank you that it is so easy to talk to you.
[2262.38 --> 2266.74]  We don't have to face a particular direction.
[2266.74 --> 2270.24]  We don't have to assume a specific posture.
[2272.66 --> 2273.56]  You are here.
[2274.16 --> 2276.78]  And thank you for that.
[2277.58 --> 2288.72]  So this morning, Lord, we want to raise up prayers, petitions, gratitude, and concerns to you.
[2289.74 --> 2291.20]  And we ask that you hear our prayers.
[2291.20 --> 2297.88]  Father, we want to ask that you will be with the family of Tony Vanderweel.
[2298.88 --> 2302.10]  He died recently and his funeral is going to be this week.
[2302.10 --> 2307.66]  Thank you for his life and the testimony of his life.
[2308.62 --> 2315.66]  But please provide your peace and comfort to those who mourn his loss.
[2315.66 --> 2328.84]  Father, we want to ask that you help those who struggle daily with addictions to alcohol, drugs, pornography.
[2328.84 --> 2337.44]  We are so good at making idols out of basically anything that you have created.
[2337.44 --> 2343.24]  And some of our brothers and sisters really, really struggle.
[2343.24 --> 2352.36]  So, Father, in particular, we ask that you will grant those who struggle courage to reach out for help.
[2352.36 --> 2368.06]  But also, will you, with all of us who may be available to help, make us or keep us humble
[2368.06 --> 2381.64]  and make this a safe place so that people can be vulnerable and take the risk of asking for help.
[2383.30 --> 2389.30]  Father, we want to lift up all of those who struggle with depression and with anxiety.
[2389.30 --> 2397.04]  Sometimes these challenges are harder in the winter because it's darker.
[2397.36 --> 2398.80]  We're inside a lot more.
[2400.40 --> 2409.66]  Father, give peace to these people and give courage and encouragement.
[2409.66 --> 2419.20]  And then for their friends, family, and loved ones, help them to be good listeners, encouragers.
[2419.30 --> 2426.88]  And help all of us not to give advice unless it's asked.
[2427.98 --> 2434.66]  We want to pray for Elise Wagoner's father, Doug Hendon.
[2435.00 --> 2438.46]  He is struggling with stage 4 cancer.
[2439.00 --> 2443.40]  We want to lift up to you Amanda Hogan-Wonings' sister, Tanya.
[2444.02 --> 2447.74]  She's also struggling with stage 4 cancer.
[2447.74 --> 2454.70]  In these two cases, Lord, please give courage, good cheer, strength, and healing.
[2455.80 --> 2464.44]  We also want to lift up Jared Jensen's daughter, Tessa, who is going for tests just in a couple of days on Tuesday
[2464.44 --> 2468.28]  to determine a course of action for a mass in her lungs.
[2469.10 --> 2474.64]  Father, also give her courage, healing, and good news.
[2474.64 --> 2489.18]  We also want to lift up all of those people in our congregation who are shut-ins because of a host of reasons
[2489.18 --> 2491.74]  are not able to physically be here.
[2492.68 --> 2497.26]  Give them a full measure of your presence and keep them encouraged.
[2497.26 --> 2502.76]  Again, in these dark days of winter to be housebound.
[2503.72 --> 2504.40]  It's hard.
[2505.92 --> 2512.08]  So in all these things, Lord, we know that you can work miracles and you can do anything.
[2513.08 --> 2516.36]  But you have called us to be your hands and feet.
[2516.36 --> 2521.22]  So as we think about all the people we've just prayed for,
[2521.90 --> 2529.56]  help us to remember and think of ways that we can be the hands and feet in the presence of Jesus Christ.
[2530.64 --> 2531.10]  Amen.
[2546.36 --> 2559.58]  We're going to continue in our close reading of the book of Thessalonians.
[2559.78 --> 2563.54]  We're in 1 Thessalonians right now, chapter 3.
[2564.12 --> 2569.96]  We're going to read together from verse 6 through to the end of the chapter, verse 6 through 13.
[2569.96 --> 2578.46]  As always, I encourage you, if you have a Bible, open it up and keep it open or turn it on and find our text and leave that there.
[2578.50 --> 2582.54]  If you're looking for some Bibles, there's a couple at the back that you're welcome to grab.
[2583.86 --> 2589.10]  It will be on the screen the first time we go through, but it will be helpful for you as we refer back throughout.
[2590.74 --> 2593.68]  Let's read together from 1 Thessalonians 3.
[2593.68 --> 2603.66]  But Timothy has just now come to us from you and has brought good news about your faith and love.
[2604.50 --> 2613.32]  He has told us that you have always have pleasant memories of us and that you long to see us just as we also long to see you.
[2614.38 --> 2622.38]  Therefore, brothers and sisters, in all our distress and persecution, we were encouraged about you because of your faith.
[2622.38 --> 2628.22]  For now we really live, since you are standing firm in the Lord.
[2629.10 --> 2636.10]  How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy we have in the presence of our God because of you?
[2637.06 --> 2643.68]  Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may seek you again and supply what is lacking in your faith.
[2645.20 --> 2651.12]  Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus clear the way for us to come to you.
[2651.12 --> 2660.34]  And may the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else, just as ours does for you.
[2661.24 --> 2667.24]  May he strengthen your hearts so that you will be blameless and holy in the presence of our God and Father
[2667.24 --> 2671.74]  when our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy ones.
[2672.24 --> 2673.42]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2673.42 --> 2684.14]  If you have been following along the Narthex podcast for the last couple of weeks,
[2684.70 --> 2689.96]  which is something that Kevin and Josh and myself do every week and we reflect on the sermon,
[2690.56 --> 2698.58]  in that Josh has had the gall to call Kevin and I old by making particular cultural references
[2698.58 --> 2702.26]  to certain movies of a particular age.
[2703.50 --> 2707.36]  And so instead of fighting against Josh, I'm just going to embrace it.
[2707.96 --> 2712.50]  And so this is going to mean absolutely nothing to probably 80% of you.
[2712.80 --> 2716.32]  But if you were born in the six-year window that I was born in,
[2716.50 --> 2718.70]  how many of you are familiar with the movie Iron Eagle?
[2720.16 --> 2720.52]  Yeah!
[2721.46 --> 2722.28]  We got one.
[2722.48 --> 2723.50]  Oh, my dad at the back.
[2723.58 --> 2723.76]  Yep.
[2723.86 --> 2724.12]  Ken.
[2724.36 --> 2724.88]  Very good.
[2724.96 --> 2726.66]  Ken, you're almost outside that six-year window.
[2726.80 --> 2727.18]  Good job.
[2727.18 --> 2732.34]  So the movie Iron Eagle is about a young man, teenager,
[2732.88 --> 2737.92]  who is in the Air Force cadet program in the United States.
[2738.02 --> 2741.48]  His father is an Air Force captain and fighter pilot
[2741.48 --> 2746.28]  who goes on a mission to some Middle Eastern country.
[2746.40 --> 2749.48]  They're very careful to not actually tell you what country it is,
[2749.86 --> 2754.20]  being politically correct at the time in the early to mid-80s.
[2754.20 --> 2757.48]  And he is shot down and captured.
[2758.42 --> 2761.76]  And so the plot of the movie is this young man and his friends
[2761.76 --> 2765.62]  coming up with a plan for how they're going to steal some fighter jets
[2765.62 --> 2767.40]  from the Air Force base that they live on,
[2767.70 --> 2769.34]  fly halfway around the world,
[2769.74 --> 2771.68]  somehow manage to land their planes,
[2771.88 --> 2773.06]  rescue dad from prison,
[2773.16 --> 2774.60]  get back in their fighter jets,
[2774.72 --> 2778.14]  and fly all the way back to the United States Air Force base.
[2778.14 --> 2780.10]  It's highly improbable,
[2780.60 --> 2783.98]  but watching that movie changed about four years of my life.
[2784.80 --> 2786.42]  Because after watching that movie,
[2786.80 --> 2788.08]  after hearing that story,
[2788.20 --> 2791.30]  after seeing that story like a thousand times when I was a kid,
[2791.48 --> 2794.06]  all I wanted to do was be a fighter pilot.
[2795.34 --> 2797.74]  Now, unfortunately, my father wasn't in the Air Force,
[2797.84 --> 2798.84]  and so he didn't get kidnapped,
[2798.94 --> 2800.52]  and I had no opportunity to do that.
[2800.52 --> 2803.26]  It was clearly his fault that that never happened.
[2806.10 --> 2812.14]  But that story changed the way I saw my own story in my own life.
[2813.16 --> 2816.54]  Made me want to live a particular way and do a particular thing.
[2818.92 --> 2820.56]  Maybe this one's a bit more accessible,
[2820.90 --> 2822.04]  but still from my age.
[2822.18 --> 2823.72]  How many of you know the movie The Three Ninjas?
[2825.16 --> 2826.06]  My mom hated it.
[2826.08 --> 2827.00]  Yeah, Daryl knows that one.
[2827.04 --> 2828.92]  My mom hated that movie because we watched that,
[2828.92 --> 2830.50]  and then we all decided we wanted to be ninjas,
[2830.58 --> 2831.64]  and then me and my three brothers
[2831.64 --> 2834.20]  just ended up beating each other up for the next four hours.
[2835.54 --> 2838.10]  But that story shaped what we did
[2838.10 --> 2839.58]  and how we wanted to live.
[2840.84 --> 2841.62]  Here's my point.
[2842.40 --> 2844.48]  Stories shape how you see the world.
[2845.56 --> 2848.58]  Stories have an impact on your imagination
[2848.58 --> 2851.30]  for how you want to be in the world.
[2852.50 --> 2854.80]  What Paul is doing in Thessalonians
[2854.80 --> 2856.94]  is highlighting stories
[2856.94 --> 2861.18]  that shape our experience in the world
[2861.18 --> 2863.18]  and our understanding of reality
[2863.18 --> 2867.28]  and how we might see God at work in those stories
[2867.28 --> 2869.50]  in order to spur us
[2869.50 --> 2871.98]  in the midst of our particular stories
[2871.98 --> 2875.10]  of trial and struggle and hardship.
[2875.94 --> 2878.80]  Really, the big idea that I hope we can see together...
[2878.80 --> 2882.64]  The big idea that I hope we can see together this morning
[2882.64 --> 2884.96]  is that stories of faith
[2884.96 --> 2889.72]  are fueling and shaping our prayers of faith
[2889.72 --> 2892.52]  for the saints to stand firm.
[2893.46 --> 2895.18]  So there's sort of three moves in there
[2895.18 --> 2896.26]  that I want us to see.
[2896.38 --> 2899.78]  First, stories of faith fueling and shaping us
[2899.78 --> 2903.40]  and stories of faith directing our prayers
[2903.40 --> 2904.54]  in a particular way
[2904.54 --> 2907.18]  and stories of faith and prayers
[2907.18 --> 2910.26]  being used by God
[2910.26 --> 2915.28]  to make the saints, the church, stand firm.
[2916.46 --> 2919.18]  Now, the part of the text that we read here
[2919.18 --> 2921.78]  in 1 Thessalonians 3
[2921.78 --> 2924.22]  kind of jumps right into the middle
[2924.22 --> 2926.08]  of Paul's longing and writing.
[2926.22 --> 2927.74]  And if you were here last week,
[2927.84 --> 2929.72]  Pastor Sean did an excellent job
[2929.72 --> 2932.78]  of carrying us into this story.
[2932.78 --> 2935.52]  And in verse 6, where we picked up,
[2935.60 --> 2936.00]  he says,
[2936.50 --> 2940.26]  Timothy has just now come to us from you.
[2941.54 --> 2943.92]  And so remember, if you will,
[2944.00 --> 2944.64]  what happened
[2944.64 --> 2948.74]  while Paul was in Thessalonica.
[2949.60 --> 2951.50]  You can read about it in Acts 17.
[2951.60 --> 2953.38]  If you want to flip to it in your Bibles,
[2953.46 --> 2954.10]  you can do that.
[2954.38 --> 2956.56]  But let me just recap that story quickly for us.
[2957.28 --> 2959.42]  Paul and his missionary partners,
[2959.62 --> 2960.74]  Silas and Timothy,
[2960.74 --> 2963.08]  arrived in Thessalonica
[2963.08 --> 2965.52]  after spending time in Philippi.
[2966.16 --> 2967.54]  When they get to Thessalonica,
[2967.70 --> 2969.36]  they stay there for three weeks
[2969.36 --> 2972.52]  preaching the gospel each Sabbath day,
[2972.62 --> 2973.28]  which is Saturday.
[2974.24 --> 2976.06]  And Paul would go to the synagogue
[2976.06 --> 2977.24]  in Thessalonica,
[2977.34 --> 2978.12]  and he would preach
[2978.12 --> 2979.76]  that Jesus is the Messiah.
[2980.58 --> 2982.32]  And as a result of this preaching ministry
[2982.32 --> 2983.68]  there in Thessalonica,
[2983.80 --> 2985.00]  some of the Jews believed,
[2985.00 --> 2987.08]  we read in Acts 17, verse 4,
[2987.56 --> 2988.96]  so did a number of Greeks,
[2989.38 --> 2992.44]  and so did quite a few prominent women,
[2992.72 --> 2993.16]  Paul writes,
[2994.02 --> 2995.32]  or Luke writes in Acts.
[2996.58 --> 3000.46]  Now, because of this ministry success there,
[3000.80 --> 3002.78]  some of the other Jews became jealous,
[3002.78 --> 3005.28]  and they started a riot in the city.
[3005.42 --> 3007.32]  And they blamed that riot
[3007.32 --> 3008.56]  on the early Christians.
[3008.56 --> 3011.80]  And then this mob goes to Jason's house,
[3012.04 --> 3013.72]  where Paul, Silas, and Timothy
[3013.72 --> 3014.76]  were likely staying,
[3015.34 --> 3016.60]  and they take Jason
[3016.60 --> 3018.34]  and some other of the early Christians
[3018.34 --> 3020.04]  before the city officials,
[3020.42 --> 3022.28]  accusing them of sedition
[3022.28 --> 3024.72]  and causing trouble all over the world.
[3024.98 --> 3026.66]  That's in Acts 17, 6, and 7.
[3027.22 --> 3028.58]  And Jason and the others
[3028.58 --> 3031.74]  are fined and likely put under watch.
[3032.08 --> 3032.92]  That is, there's somebody
[3032.92 --> 3034.26]  probably watching their house.
[3034.26 --> 3036.60]  Now, that same night,
[3037.12 --> 3039.62]  the believers send Paul
[3039.62 --> 3041.06]  and Silas and Timothy
[3041.06 --> 3043.10]  to the next city over,
[3043.26 --> 3044.54]  to the city of Berea.
[3046.42 --> 3049.00]  Now, when the Jewish leaders found out,
[3049.08 --> 3050.58]  the Jewish leaders in Thessalonica
[3050.58 --> 3052.76]  hear that Paul and Silas and Timothy
[3052.76 --> 3054.36]  have made their way to Berea,
[3054.62 --> 3056.20]  a group of the Jewish leaders
[3056.20 --> 3057.98]  from Thessalonica follow Paul
[3057.98 --> 3059.44]  to Berea,
[3059.56 --> 3061.22]  and they stir up trouble there
[3061.22 --> 3062.24]  for them as well.
[3062.66 --> 3064.10]  And so the Christians in Berea
[3064.10 --> 3066.10]  send Paul down the coast
[3066.10 --> 3067.36]  towards Athens,
[3067.64 --> 3070.42]  and we read that Silas and Timothy
[3070.42 --> 3072.36]  stayed back in Berea.
[3073.72 --> 3076.48]  From Athens, Paul goes to Corinth,
[3076.74 --> 3078.00]  where he ends up staying
[3078.00 --> 3079.22]  for a year and a half.
[3080.20 --> 3081.62]  And probably early on
[3081.62 --> 3083.72]  in his stay in Corinth,
[3083.92 --> 3086.12]  Silas and Timothy join him again,
[3086.50 --> 3088.52]  we read in Acts 18, 5,
[3088.78 --> 3089.82]  from Macedonia.
[3090.22 --> 3092.18]  And so that's where Thessalonica is.
[3092.18 --> 3094.24]  So Timothy has gone back
[3094.24 --> 3095.84]  to the churches
[3095.84 --> 3098.40]  and the church in Thessalonica
[3098.40 --> 3101.12]  and now comes back to Paul
[3101.12 --> 3103.74]  while he is in the city of Corinth.
[3104.24 --> 3106.60]  And this is where Paul writes the letter.
[3106.74 --> 3107.38]  And so Paul,
[3107.60 --> 3109.24]  hearing this message from Timothy
[3109.24 --> 3110.52]  about the faithfulness
[3110.52 --> 3112.50]  of the Christians in Thessalonica,
[3113.22 --> 3115.52]  when he and Silas join him,
[3116.22 --> 3118.64]  he writes this letter of thanksgiving
[3118.64 --> 3121.30]  and encouragement to the church there,
[3121.44 --> 3123.10]  sometime around A.D. 50,
[3123.30 --> 3124.38]  maybe A.D. 51.
[3125.36 --> 3126.82]  And Paul is so excited
[3126.82 --> 3128.62]  and so grateful for the news
[3128.62 --> 3131.64]  that he hears about their faith and love.
[3132.64 --> 3135.48]  In fact, the way Paul reflects that here
[3135.48 --> 3136.72]  is really interesting.
[3137.28 --> 3137.88]  Paul writes,
[3138.40 --> 3140.08]  Timothy has brought us,
[3140.14 --> 3141.02]  and you can see it there
[3141.02 --> 3142.28]  at the end of,
[3142.52 --> 3143.54]  in the middle of verse 6,
[3143.64 --> 3144.64]  brought us good news
[3144.64 --> 3147.56]  news about your faith and love.
[3148.46 --> 3150.44]  That word that Paul uses there
[3150.44 --> 3151.96]  that's translated good news
[3151.96 --> 3154.66]  is euangelizomai,
[3155.02 --> 3156.54]  which is the Greek word
[3156.54 --> 3158.24]  that's most often,
[3158.36 --> 3160.02]  actually in every other case,
[3160.48 --> 3161.90]  translated as gospel
[3161.90 --> 3164.44]  or translated as the good news
[3164.44 --> 3165.66]  about Jesus' life,
[3165.96 --> 3166.18]  death,
[3166.64 --> 3167.32]  and resurrection.
[3167.32 --> 3170.62]  Now, I think there's something beautiful
[3170.62 --> 3171.80]  going on
[3171.80 --> 3174.62]  in the use of this word choice here
[3174.62 --> 3175.70]  for Paul, right?
[3175.78 --> 3178.18]  Writing in the power of the Holy Spirit,
[3178.44 --> 3179.86]  there's something magnificent
[3179.86 --> 3181.42]  and compelling for us
[3181.42 --> 3182.72]  in this language.
[3183.78 --> 3185.28]  What I want to suggest to you
[3185.28 --> 3186.02]  is that Paul
[3186.02 --> 3188.76]  is treating their perseverance
[3188.76 --> 3190.48]  in the faith
[3190.48 --> 3192.58]  as gospel.
[3193.94 --> 3194.26]  Right?
[3194.38 --> 3195.18]  Their standing
[3195.18 --> 3196.48]  is confirmation
[3196.48 --> 3198.38]  of the goodness
[3198.38 --> 3199.98]  and the truth
[3199.98 --> 3201.18]  of the gospel.
[3202.02 --> 3203.54]  Their standing firm
[3203.54 --> 3205.68]  as those who have received it
[3205.68 --> 3206.44]  is confirmation
[3206.44 --> 3208.36]  that the gospel message
[3208.36 --> 3209.28]  is effective
[3209.28 --> 3210.60]  in their life.
[3211.52 --> 3211.74]  Right?
[3211.82 --> 3213.10]  Their life and faith
[3213.10 --> 3214.70]  through the struggle,
[3214.98 --> 3216.00]  through the suffering,
[3216.44 --> 3217.30]  through the trial,
[3217.50 --> 3218.36]  through the hardship
[3218.36 --> 3219.58]  is,
[3220.50 --> 3221.32]  for Paul,
[3221.32 --> 3223.32]  a form of proclaiming
[3224.16 --> 3225.10]  the gospel.
[3225.18 --> 3228.46]  So here's what I want us
[3228.46 --> 3229.24]  to hear.
[3230.64 --> 3231.64]  There is a sense,
[3232.14 --> 3234.48]  there is a sense
[3234.48 --> 3234.98]  in which
[3234.98 --> 3236.68]  your perseverance
[3236.68 --> 3238.38]  in hard things
[3238.38 --> 3239.56]  of faith
[3239.56 --> 3240.96]  is because
[3240.96 --> 3242.46]  of God's
[3242.46 --> 3243.24]  preservation
[3243.24 --> 3245.68]  of your faith
[3245.68 --> 3246.88]  by His grace.
[3249.02 --> 3250.44]  Let me say that again.
[3251.18 --> 3252.42]  Your perseverance,
[3253.06 --> 3254.52]  that is your stick-to-itiveness,
[3254.52 --> 3255.90]  in faith,
[3255.90 --> 3257.16]  in the hard things
[3257.16 --> 3257.68]  of life
[3257.68 --> 3258.28]  and of faith
[3258.28 --> 3259.18]  is because
[3259.18 --> 3262.48]  God is preserving you,
[3262.60 --> 3264.68]  He is holding you fast
[3264.68 --> 3266.28]  by His grace.
[3267.40 --> 3268.74]  Standing firm
[3268.74 --> 3269.60]  to the end
[3269.60 --> 3271.48]  is part of
[3271.48 --> 3272.46]  proclaiming
[3272.46 --> 3273.34]  the gospel
[3273.34 --> 3274.18]  and part of
[3274.18 --> 3274.94]  proclaiming
[3274.94 --> 3275.78]  the gospel
[3275.78 --> 3277.08]  is proclaiming
[3277.08 --> 3277.72]  the truth
[3277.72 --> 3279.00]  of standing firm
[3279.00 --> 3279.68]  to the end
[3279.68 --> 3280.94]  based on
[3280.94 --> 3281.68]  God's
[3281.68 --> 3283.12]  preservation
[3283.12 --> 3284.52]  by His grace.
[3285.14 --> 3285.36]  Now,
[3286.12 --> 3286.98]  I understand
[3286.98 --> 3288.52]  maybe it's too early
[3288.52 --> 3289.06]  in the morning
[3289.06 --> 3290.12]  for this kind
[3290.12 --> 3290.62]  of doctrine,
[3291.06 --> 3292.76]  but I want to give you
[3292.76 --> 3293.86]  at least two reasons
[3293.86 --> 3295.16]  why this idea
[3295.16 --> 3296.72]  is so crucial
[3296.72 --> 3298.14]  and why this matters
[3298.14 --> 3298.66]  for us.
[3299.54 --> 3300.16]  One,
[3301.26 --> 3303.78]  this truth,
[3304.02 --> 3304.94]  this reality
[3304.94 --> 3307.08]  that we persevere
[3307.08 --> 3308.02]  in hard things
[3308.02 --> 3308.64]  because God
[3308.64 --> 3309.86]  is preserving us
[3309.86 --> 3310.78]  by His grace,
[3311.36 --> 3312.16]  this truth
[3312.16 --> 3313.46]  matters for us
[3313.46 --> 3314.24]  because it means
[3314.24 --> 3315.80]  that whatever trial
[3315.80 --> 3316.96]  you are facing
[3316.96 --> 3318.46]  or may one day face,
[3319.74 --> 3320.52]  whatever hardship
[3320.52 --> 3321.64]  you are going through
[3321.64 --> 3322.48]  or may one day
[3322.48 --> 3323.20]  go through,
[3323.26 --> 3324.00]  whatever struggle
[3324.00 --> 3325.24]  you are currently
[3325.24 --> 3326.18]  in the midst of,
[3326.24 --> 3327.64]  and even if it is
[3327.64 --> 3328.84]  feeling absolutely
[3328.84 --> 3330.52]  and utterly overwhelming,
[3330.52 --> 3333.82]  whatever it is,
[3334.82 --> 3335.92]  it is a chance
[3335.92 --> 3336.96]  to proclaim
[3336.96 --> 3338.30]  the gospel
[3338.30 --> 3340.32]  or for the gospel
[3340.32 --> 3341.38]  to be proclaimed
[3341.38 --> 3342.76]  in and through
[3342.76 --> 3343.68]  your life
[3343.68 --> 3344.40]  and story.
[3345.40 --> 3346.24]  In fact,
[3346.78 --> 3348.40]  even if
[3348.40 --> 3349.64]  that trial
[3349.64 --> 3351.52]  goes unto death,
[3352.34 --> 3353.20]  this is a chance
[3353.20 --> 3353.90]  to proclaim
[3353.90 --> 3355.22]  the gospel.
[3358.10 --> 3359.40]  I have a friend
[3359.40 --> 3360.60]  who,
[3361.22 --> 3362.52]  excuse me,
[3362.54 --> 3363.28]  who this week
[3363.28 --> 3364.80]  is walking
[3364.80 --> 3365.40]  through
[3365.40 --> 3367.06]  three deaths
[3367.06 --> 3368.50]  and three funerals
[3368.50 --> 3369.42]  in his community
[3369.42 --> 3372.10]  and he relayed
[3372.10 --> 3372.62]  to us
[3372.62 --> 3373.32]  a story
[3373.32 --> 3375.04]  from someone
[3375.04 --> 3375.78]  that he was
[3375.78 --> 3376.60]  ministering to
[3376.60 --> 3377.42]  while she was
[3377.42 --> 3378.14]  on her deathbed.
[3379.20 --> 3380.10]  And as he was
[3380.10 --> 3380.82]  talking to her,
[3380.90 --> 3381.24]  he said,
[3381.66 --> 3381.84]  you know,
[3381.90 --> 3382.48]  all of this
[3382.48 --> 3383.10]  must be really
[3383.10 --> 3383.88]  hard to face.
[3385.62 --> 3386.44]  And she looked
[3386.44 --> 3387.16]  him in the eyes,
[3387.96 --> 3388.42]  bless her
[3388.42 --> 3389.56]  93-year-old
[3389.56 --> 3390.30]  saintly heart
[3390.30 --> 3391.64]  and said,
[3391.84 --> 3392.56]  don't worry
[3392.56 --> 3393.12]  about me,
[3393.68 --> 3394.84]  it's only death.
[3396.34 --> 3397.70]  It's only death.
[3399.74 --> 3400.68]  That's the kind
[3400.68 --> 3401.26]  of story
[3401.26 --> 3402.64]  that proclaims
[3402.64 --> 3403.20]  the gospel.
[3404.90 --> 3405.10]  Right?
[3405.12 --> 3405.54]  And I've seen
[3405.54 --> 3406.34]  it so many times,
[3406.44 --> 3407.24]  not just from
[3407.24 --> 3408.44]  93-year-old seasoned
[3408.44 --> 3408.80]  saints,
[3408.92 --> 3410.04]  but from 30-year-olds
[3410.04 --> 3411.30]  diagnosed with cancer,
[3412.00 --> 3413.26]  from 50-year-olds
[3413.26 --> 3414.56]  with ALS.
[3414.56 --> 3416.36]  Right?
[3416.58 --> 3417.56]  Even death
[3417.56 --> 3418.64]  and facing death
[3418.64 --> 3419.28]  is a chance
[3419.28 --> 3420.08]  to proclaim
[3420.08 --> 3420.72]  the truth
[3420.72 --> 3421.38]  of the gospel,
[3421.88 --> 3422.54]  especially
[3422.54 --> 3424.22]  as we read it
[3424.22 --> 3424.96]  in light of
[3424.96 --> 3426.42]  1 Corinthians 15.
[3427.40 --> 3428.14]  This is worth
[3428.14 --> 3428.64]  looking at,
[3428.68 --> 3429.02]  and so we're
[3429.02 --> 3429.42]  going to put it
[3429.42 --> 3429.96]  on the screen
[3429.96 --> 3431.50]  behind us.
[3431.98 --> 3432.72]  Starting in
[3432.72 --> 3433.54]  verse 54,
[3434.50 --> 3435.18]  Paul says,
[3435.70 --> 3436.90]  death has been
[3436.90 --> 3437.66]  swallowed up
[3437.66 --> 3438.36]  in victory.
[3438.98 --> 3439.52]  Where,
[3439.70 --> 3440.12]  O death,
[3440.12 --> 3441.02]  is your victory?
[3441.20 --> 3441.46]  Where,
[3441.56 --> 3441.98]  O death,
[3442.06 --> 3442.86]  is your sting?
[3442.86 --> 3444.54]  The sting of death
[3444.54 --> 3445.26]  is sin,
[3445.38 --> 3446.00]  and the power
[3446.00 --> 3446.48]  of sin
[3446.48 --> 3447.22]  is the law,
[3447.62 --> 3448.66]  but thanks be
[3448.66 --> 3449.36]  to God,
[3449.46 --> 3450.30]  he gives us
[3450.30 --> 3450.86]  the victory
[3450.86 --> 3451.80]  through our Lord
[3451.80 --> 3453.00]  Jesus Christ.
[3453.10 --> 3453.90]  That's the gospel.
[3455.70 --> 3456.76]  Death has died
[3456.76 --> 3457.42]  by the death
[3457.42 --> 3458.04]  of Christ.
[3458.64 --> 3459.58]  Victory is ours
[3459.58 --> 3460.36]  by the resurrection
[3460.36 --> 3460.94]  of Christ.
[3461.32 --> 3462.48]  Victory over death
[3462.48 --> 3463.38]  and victory
[3463.38 --> 3464.48]  over the sting
[3464.48 --> 3465.22]  of death,
[3465.38 --> 3466.24]  which is sin.
[3468.22 --> 3469.42]  That's the gospel.
[3470.64 --> 3471.28]  And then listen
[3471.28 --> 3472.26]  to what Paul says
[3472.26 --> 3473.16]  immediately after.
[3474.48 --> 3475.32]  He gives this
[3475.32 --> 3476.38]  gospel presentation
[3476.38 --> 3477.66]  about life
[3477.66 --> 3478.34]  in the face
[3478.34 --> 3479.00]  of death
[3479.00 --> 3480.26]  and gospel
[3480.26 --> 3481.12]  in the face
[3481.12 --> 3482.10]  of death
[3482.10 --> 3482.68]  and the gospel
[3482.68 --> 3483.40]  of victory
[3483.40 --> 3484.44]  over sin
[3484.44 --> 3484.94]  and death,
[3485.06 --> 3485.74]  and then he says,
[3486.22 --> 3486.56]  therefore,
[3487.20 --> 3488.16]  my dear brothers
[3488.16 --> 3489.44]  and sisters,
[3490.10 --> 3491.36]  stand firm.
[3492.20 --> 3493.50]  Let nothing
[3493.50 --> 3494.80]  move you.
[3496.48 --> 3497.56]  Stand firm.
[3497.70 --> 3498.38]  Let nothing
[3498.38 --> 3499.02]  move you,
[3499.06 --> 3499.58]  or the language
[3499.58 --> 3500.02]  of Paul
[3500.02 --> 3501.36]  from last time,
[3501.48 --> 3502.44]  or let nothing
[3502.44 --> 3503.70]  unsettle you.
[3504.54 --> 3504.76]  Right?
[3504.78 --> 3505.96]  It's the same language
[3505.96 --> 3507.18]  in 1 Corinthians
[3507.18 --> 3507.98]  that Paul has been
[3507.98 --> 3508.48]  using here
[3508.48 --> 3509.22]  in Thessalonians.
[3510.22 --> 3511.32]  And what does it
[3511.32 --> 3511.96]  mean in summary?
[3512.68 --> 3513.22]  Don't worry
[3513.22 --> 3513.78]  about me.
[3514.44 --> 3515.44]  It's only death.
[3517.04 --> 3517.80]  Don't worry
[3517.80 --> 3518.34]  about me.
[3519.00 --> 3521.16]  It's only death.
[3523.04 --> 3523.60]  Imagine,
[3523.60 --> 3526.92]  imagine it,
[3527.92 --> 3529.22]  your faith
[3529.22 --> 3532.04]  proclaims the gospel
[3532.04 --> 3534.24]  in every trial
[3534.24 --> 3535.22]  you face,
[3535.62 --> 3536.82]  every temptation
[3536.82 --> 3537.90]  that you endure,
[3538.06 --> 3538.98]  every victory
[3538.98 --> 3539.74]  over sin
[3539.74 --> 3540.70]  that you experience,
[3540.78 --> 3542.26]  you give testimony to,
[3542.44 --> 3543.32]  and you proclaim
[3543.32 --> 3544.16]  the gospel
[3544.16 --> 3545.64]  by persevering,
[3546.04 --> 3546.98]  by having this
[3546.98 --> 3547.76]  victory,
[3548.44 --> 3549.66]  by living transformed.
[3549.66 --> 3551.54]  You proclaim
[3551.54 --> 3552.10]  the gospel
[3552.10 --> 3553.66]  by not being moved,
[3554.06 --> 3554.88]  by remaining
[3554.88 --> 3556.62]  settled in your faith
[3556.62 --> 3557.74]  and in your love,
[3558.54 --> 3560.02]  by standing firm
[3560.02 --> 3561.44]  for the truth
[3561.44 --> 3563.64]  and in love.
[3566.22 --> 3567.32]  That's why
[3567.32 --> 3569.06]  this matters.
[3569.06 --> 3574.00]  And two,
[3575.26 --> 3576.16]  second reason
[3576.16 --> 3577.02]  why this doctrine
[3577.02 --> 3578.24]  matters,
[3578.44 --> 3578.80]  that we
[3578.80 --> 3580.12]  persevere
[3580.12 --> 3581.50]  because of God's
[3581.50 --> 3582.86]  preservation.
[3584.14 --> 3585.32]  This matters
[3585.32 --> 3586.40]  because
[3586.40 --> 3587.96]  what we're beginning
[3587.96 --> 3588.70]  to see
[3588.70 --> 3590.50]  is the implicit
[3590.50 --> 3591.58]  promise of God
[3591.58 --> 3593.04]  given in the gospel
[3593.04 --> 3594.82]  made explicit
[3594.82 --> 3596.42]  by our living
[3596.42 --> 3597.60]  in response
[3597.60 --> 3598.18]  to it.
[3599.06 --> 3600.48]  If you believe
[3600.48 --> 3601.40]  and have faith,
[3601.48 --> 3602.36]  if you have accepted
[3602.36 --> 3603.04]  the truth
[3603.04 --> 3604.08]  of the gospel
[3604.08 --> 3604.82]  by faith
[3604.82 --> 3606.40]  and have received
[3606.40 --> 3607.58]  God's love,
[3607.96 --> 3608.96]  the truth is
[3608.96 --> 3609.70]  there is now
[3609.70 --> 3610.24]  nothing
[3610.24 --> 3611.56]  that can separate
[3611.56 --> 3612.46]  you from the love
[3612.46 --> 3612.82]  of God
[3612.82 --> 3613.48]  that is available
[3613.48 --> 3614.34]  in Christ Jesus.
[3615.76 --> 3616.64]  Jesus says
[3616.64 --> 3617.20]  in the gospel
[3617.20 --> 3617.70]  of John
[3617.70 --> 3618.42]  in John 6,
[3619.34 --> 3620.18]  he says,
[3620.78 --> 3621.58]  all those
[3621.58 --> 3622.88]  the Father gives me
[3622.88 --> 3623.98]  will come to me
[3623.98 --> 3624.54]  and whoever
[3624.54 --> 3625.64]  comes to me
[3625.64 --> 3626.46]  I will never
[3626.46 --> 3627.22]  drive away
[3627.22 --> 3628.76]  for I have
[3628.76 --> 3629.26]  come down
[3629.26 --> 3629.74]  from heaven
[3629.74 --> 3630.34]  not to do
[3630.34 --> 3631.00]  my will
[3631.00 --> 3631.54]  but to do
[3631.54 --> 3631.94]  the will
[3631.94 --> 3632.32]  of him
[3632.32 --> 3633.02]  who sent me
[3633.02 --> 3633.98]  and this
[3633.98 --> 3634.94]  is the will
[3634.94 --> 3635.42]  of him
[3635.42 --> 3636.24]  who sent me
[3636.24 --> 3637.24]  that I
[3637.24 --> 3638.10]  shall lose
[3638.10 --> 3638.70]  none
[3638.70 --> 3639.68]  of all
[3639.68 --> 3640.14]  those
[3640.14 --> 3640.66]  he has
[3640.66 --> 3641.42]  given me
[3641.42 --> 3642.64]  but raise
[3642.64 --> 3643.46]  them up
[3643.46 --> 3644.82]  on the last
[3644.82 --> 3645.14]  day.
[3646.14 --> 3647.14]  I shall
[3647.14 --> 3648.06]  lose none
[3648.06 --> 3649.52]  of all
[3649.52 --> 3649.84]  those
[3649.84 --> 3650.20]  he has
[3650.20 --> 3650.76]  given me.
[3651.30 --> 3652.22]  This too
[3652.22 --> 3653.70]  is the gospel.
[3653.70 --> 3655.94]  You can
[3655.94 --> 3656.74]  persevere
[3656.74 --> 3657.38]  because you
[3657.38 --> 3657.88]  are being
[3657.88 --> 3658.40]  preserved
[3658.40 --> 3659.46]  by God.
[3660.30 --> 3660.92]  Your right
[3660.92 --> 3661.72]  now trial
[3661.72 --> 3662.66]  can be faced
[3662.66 --> 3663.40]  with the kind
[3663.40 --> 3664.08]  of sovereign
[3664.08 --> 3665.04]  God confidence
[3665.04 --> 3665.86]  that comes
[3665.86 --> 3666.26]  from this
[3666.26 --> 3666.68]  truth.
[3667.62 --> 3668.04]  The truth
[3668.04 --> 3668.46]  that not a
[3668.46 --> 3668.92]  hair can
[3668.92 --> 3669.38]  fall from
[3669.38 --> 3669.78]  your head
[3669.78 --> 3670.36]  without the
[3670.36 --> 3671.26]  will of
[3671.26 --> 3671.94]  our God
[3671.94 --> 3672.38]  in heaven.
[3672.54 --> 3673.04]  That kind
[3673.04 --> 3673.68]  of confidence
[3673.68 --> 3674.56]  undergirds
[3674.56 --> 3675.32]  your facing
[3675.32 --> 3675.80]  trials.
[3676.50 --> 3677.04]  The truth
[3677.04 --> 3677.38]  that all
[3677.38 --> 3678.22]  things must
[3678.22 --> 3678.84]  work together
[3678.84 --> 3679.26]  for his
[3679.26 --> 3679.82]  glory and
[3679.82 --> 3680.24]  for your
[3680.24 --> 3680.56]  good.
[3680.90 --> 3681.36]  That kind
[3681.36 --> 3681.94]  of confidence
[3681.94 --> 3682.64]  is the
[3682.64 --> 3683.14]  foundation
[3683.14 --> 3684.06]  onto which
[3684.06 --> 3684.82]  you step
[3684.82 --> 3685.60]  forward
[3685.60 --> 3687.32]  into whatever
[3687.32 --> 3688.18]  it is
[3688.18 --> 3689.32]  that God
[3689.32 --> 3689.86]  calls you.
[3690.70 --> 3690.98]  Your
[3690.98 --> 3692.00]  persevering
[3692.00 --> 3692.70]  in trial
[3692.70 --> 3693.70]  and suffering
[3693.70 --> 3695.12]  is gospel
[3695.12 --> 3695.86]  because it
[3695.86 --> 3696.60]  is a
[3696.60 --> 3697.56]  lived message
[3697.56 --> 3698.32]  of God
[3698.32 --> 3698.94]  preserving
[3698.94 --> 3699.44]  you.
[3699.90 --> 3700.12]  No matter
[3700.12 --> 3700.74]  what trial
[3700.74 --> 3701.44]  you face,
[3701.70 --> 3701.86]  no matter
[3701.86 --> 3702.44]  what struggle
[3702.44 --> 3702.98]  you find
[3702.98 --> 3703.48]  yourself in,
[3703.56 --> 3704.08]  God is
[3704.08 --> 3704.72]  with you
[3704.72 --> 3705.32]  and he
[3705.32 --> 3705.88]  is telling
[3705.88 --> 3706.58]  the story
[3706.58 --> 3707.08]  of his
[3707.08 --> 3707.54]  gospel
[3707.54 --> 3708.26]  through
[3708.26 --> 3709.28]  your story
[3709.28 --> 3710.90]  that he
[3710.90 --> 3711.26]  will not
[3711.26 --> 3711.52]  lose
[3711.52 --> 3712.16]  any
[3712.16 --> 3713.22]  the
[3713.22 --> 3713.46]  father
[3713.46 --> 3713.68]  has
[3713.68 --> 3713.90]  given
[3713.90 --> 3714.20]  him.
[3715.70 --> 3715.98]  Or to
[3715.98 --> 3716.32]  put it
[3716.32 --> 3717.48]  like Paul
[3717.48 --> 3717.84]  does in
[3717.84 --> 3719.92]  2 Corinthians
[3719.92 --> 3722.14]  we are
[3722.14 --> 3722.86]  afflicted
[3722.86 --> 3723.50]  in every
[3723.50 --> 3723.88]  way
[3723.88 --> 3724.28]  but not
[3724.28 --> 3724.66]  crushed,
[3725.90 --> 3726.66]  perplexed
[3726.66 --> 3727.16]  but not
[3727.16 --> 3727.56]  driven to
[3727.56 --> 3727.98]  despair,
[3728.74 --> 3729.28]  persecuted
[3729.28 --> 3729.76]  but not
[3729.76 --> 3730.24]  forsaken,
[3730.62 --> 3731.18]  struck down
[3731.18 --> 3731.58]  but not
[3731.58 --> 3732.08]  destroyed,
[3732.46 --> 3733.38]  always carrying
[3733.38 --> 3733.82]  in the
[3733.82 --> 3734.32]  body the
[3734.32 --> 3734.76]  death of
[3734.76 --> 3735.34]  Jesus so
[3735.34 --> 3735.68]  that the
[3735.68 --> 3736.24]  life of
[3736.24 --> 3737.16]  Jesus may
[3737.16 --> 3737.74]  also be
[3737.74 --> 3738.36]  manifested
[3738.36 --> 3739.22]  in our
[3739.22 --> 3740.14]  bodies.
[3741.26 --> 3742.86]  what's
[3742.86 --> 3743.42]  the story?
[3744.42 --> 3745.00]  Are you
[3745.00 --> 3745.58]  afflicted
[3745.58 --> 3747.38]  in every
[3747.38 --> 3747.68]  way
[3747.68 --> 3749.14]  but not
[3749.14 --> 3749.56]  crushed?
[3750.86 --> 3751.50]  Are you
[3751.50 --> 3752.12]  perplexed
[3752.12 --> 3752.68]  and confused
[3752.68 --> 3753.40]  and unsure
[3753.40 --> 3753.90]  of why
[3753.90 --> 3754.26]  this is
[3754.26 --> 3754.60]  happening?
[3755.16 --> 3755.62]  Absolutely
[3755.62 --> 3756.38]  but I'm
[3756.38 --> 3756.80]  not driven
[3756.80 --> 3757.46]  to despair
[3757.46 --> 3758.40]  because of
[3758.40 --> 3758.76]  who God
[3758.76 --> 3759.06]  is.
[3759.98 --> 3760.60]  Are you
[3760.60 --> 3761.14]  persecuted?
[3761.28 --> 3761.44]  Are you
[3761.44 --> 3761.82]  cut off
[3761.82 --> 3762.26]  from certain
[3762.26 --> 3762.62]  places?
[3762.76 --> 3762.94]  Are you
[3762.94 --> 3763.36]  excluded
[3763.36 --> 3763.80]  from others?
[3763.90 --> 3764.06]  Are you
[3764.06 --> 3764.50]  made fun
[3764.50 --> 3764.98]  of for
[3764.98 --> 3765.38]  the faith
[3765.38 --> 3765.60]  that you
[3765.60 --> 3765.88]  have?
[3766.34 --> 3766.72]  Sure
[3766.72 --> 3767.76]  absolutely
[3767.76 --> 3768.22]  but I
[3768.22 --> 3768.84]  am never
[3768.84 --> 3769.42]  forsaken
[3769.42 --> 3770.24]  and never
[3770.24 --> 3770.72]  forgotten.
[3772.58 --> 3773.28]  Are you
[3773.28 --> 3773.86]  knocked down
[3773.86 --> 3774.38]  every once
[3774.38 --> 3774.92]  in a while?
[3775.42 --> 3775.82]  Yes
[3775.82 --> 3777.22]  but never
[3777.22 --> 3778.40]  destroyed
[3778.40 --> 3779.26]  never
[3779.26 --> 3780.18]  out.
[3781.62 --> 3782.24]  Your
[3782.24 --> 3782.88]  suffering
[3782.88 --> 3784.08]  tells the
[3784.08 --> 3784.70]  story
[3784.70 --> 3785.60]  of the
[3785.60 --> 3786.06]  gospel.
[3786.50 --> 3786.68]  Your
[3786.68 --> 3787.80]  persevering
[3787.80 --> 3788.58]  tells the
[3788.58 --> 3789.06]  story
[3789.06 --> 3790.06]  of Jesus
[3790.06 --> 3791.18]  always
[3791.18 --> 3791.90]  carrying
[3791.90 --> 3792.46]  in the
[3792.46 --> 3792.86]  body
[3792.86 --> 3793.42]  the death
[3793.42 --> 3794.10]  of Jesus
[3794.10 --> 3797.68]  so that
[3797.68 --> 3798.18]  the life
[3798.18 --> 3798.92]  of Jesus
[3798.92 --> 3799.98]  may also
[3799.98 --> 3800.56]  be manifest
[3800.56 --> 3801.88]  in our
[3801.88 --> 3802.28]  bodies.
[3804.68 --> 3805.52]  This
[3805.52 --> 3805.98]  matters
[3805.98 --> 3808.20]  because your
[3808.20 --> 3808.84]  suffering
[3808.84 --> 3810.32]  matters.
[3811.40 --> 3811.94]  Your
[3811.94 --> 3812.44]  suffering
[3812.44 --> 3812.82]  your
[3812.82 --> 3813.30]  trials
[3813.30 --> 3813.52]  your
[3813.52 --> 3814.02]  hardship
[3814.02 --> 3815.18]  tell
[3815.18 --> 3815.72]  the
[3815.72 --> 3816.16]  gospel.
[3816.72 --> 3816.86]  Your
[3816.86 --> 3817.34]  suffering
[3817.34 --> 3818.22]  proclaims
[3818.22 --> 3818.60]  Jesus
[3818.60 --> 3819.12]  Christ
[3819.12 --> 3819.54]  and him
[3819.54 --> 3820.28]  crucified
[3820.28 --> 3820.82]  and as
[3820.82 --> 3821.24]  Christians
[3821.24 --> 3822.12]  we need
[3822.12 --> 3822.64]  to learn
[3822.64 --> 3823.04]  how to
[3823.04 --> 3823.36]  suffer
[3823.36 --> 3823.82]  well.
[3824.10 --> 3825.30]  We need
[3825.30 --> 3825.70]  to learn
[3825.70 --> 3826.08]  how to
[3826.08 --> 3826.44]  suffer
[3826.44 --> 3827.40]  for the
[3827.40 --> 3827.84]  gospel.
[3829.40 --> 3829.88]  And part
[3829.88 --> 3830.22]  of how
[3830.22 --> 3830.76]  we do
[3830.76 --> 3831.32]  that is
[3831.32 --> 3831.70]  learning
[3831.70 --> 3832.34]  that our
[3832.34 --> 3832.78]  suffering
[3832.78 --> 3834.08]  tells the
[3834.08 --> 3834.48]  gospel.
[3835.56 --> 3836.32]  There is a
[3836.32 --> 3836.86]  confidence
[3836.86 --> 3837.82]  that comes
[3837.82 --> 3838.34]  to us
[3838.34 --> 3839.26]  here and
[3839.26 --> 3840.08]  now because
[3840.08 --> 3840.52]  our
[3840.52 --> 3841.32]  suffering
[3841.32 --> 3842.16]  our
[3842.16 --> 3843.12]  trials
[3843.12 --> 3844.42]  perplexing
[3844.42 --> 3844.84]  though they
[3844.84 --> 3845.48]  may be
[3845.48 --> 3846.58]  are always
[3846.58 --> 3847.34]  in the
[3847.34 --> 3847.92]  hands of
[3847.92 --> 3848.40]  a sovereign
[3848.40 --> 3848.86]  God.
[3848.86 --> 3849.32]  God
[3849.32 --> 3855.62]  now let
[3855.62 --> 3855.80]  me be
[3855.80 --> 3856.04]  really
[3856.04 --> 3856.44]  clear
[3856.44 --> 3858.78]  that
[3858.78 --> 3859.24]  sort
[3859.24 --> 3859.40]  of
[3859.40 --> 3859.80]  gospel
[3859.80 --> 3860.50]  confidence
[3860.50 --> 3861.90]  shows up
[3861.90 --> 3862.30]  in your
[3862.30 --> 3862.72]  life
[3862.72 --> 3863.50]  in so
[3863.50 --> 3863.72]  many
[3863.72 --> 3864.12]  ways
[3864.12 --> 3866.64]  but that
[3866.64 --> 3866.94]  sort of
[3866.94 --> 3867.28]  gospel
[3867.28 --> 3868.10]  confidence
[3868.10 --> 3869.22]  ought to
[3869.22 --> 3870.06]  never show
[3870.06 --> 3871.24]  up as
[3871.24 --> 3871.70]  arrogance
[3871.70 --> 3872.66]  or
[3872.66 --> 3873.36]  haughtiness
[3873.36 --> 3875.60]  instead our
[3875.60 --> 3876.56]  gospel confidence
[3876.56 --> 3877.36]  shows up in
[3877.36 --> 3877.92]  humility
[3877.92 --> 3879.40]  and in
[3879.40 --> 3879.88]  submission.
[3881.92 --> 3882.32]  Gospel
[3882.32 --> 3882.94]  confidence
[3882.94 --> 3884.14]  manifests in
[3884.14 --> 3885.20]  your humble
[3885.20 --> 3886.36]  service of
[3886.36 --> 3887.06]  others and
[3887.06 --> 3887.84]  your loving
[3887.84 --> 3889.04]  of everyone
[3889.04 --> 3889.78]  around you
[3889.78 --> 3890.76]  putting them
[3890.76 --> 3891.24]  first.
[3892.28 --> 3892.58]  Gospel
[3892.58 --> 3893.22]  confidence
[3893.22 --> 3893.90]  shows up
[3893.90 --> 3894.58]  it manifests
[3894.58 --> 3894.98]  in your
[3894.98 --> 3896.14]  submission to
[3896.14 --> 3896.98]  God's will
[3896.98 --> 3897.60]  and to
[3897.60 --> 3898.24]  God's way.
[3898.24 --> 3898.26]  way.
[3899.52 --> 3899.76]  And that
[3899.76 --> 3900.12]  means he
[3900.12 --> 3900.52]  gets to
[3900.52 --> 3901.28]  decide what's
[3901.28 --> 3901.74]  right for
[3901.74 --> 3902.30]  you and he
[3902.30 --> 3902.66]  gets to
[3902.66 --> 3903.60]  decide how
[3903.60 --> 3904.02]  we should
[3904.02 --> 3904.90]  live and
[3904.90 --> 3905.44]  we get to
[3905.44 --> 3905.90]  say thank
[3905.90 --> 3906.10]  you.
[3907.12 --> 3907.64]  We get to
[3907.64 --> 3907.94]  worship.
[3911.06 --> 3911.70]  And now
[3911.70 --> 3912.16]  it's these
[3912.16 --> 3913.26]  two ideas
[3913.26 --> 3914.80]  coming together
[3914.80 --> 3916.24]  that motivates
[3916.24 --> 3917.70]  and encourages
[3917.70 --> 3918.82]  Paul as he
[3918.82 --> 3919.56]  sees God at
[3919.56 --> 3919.82]  work.
[3920.46 --> 3920.58]  Right?
[3920.64 --> 3921.02]  He says
[3921.02 --> 3922.78]  therefore
[3922.78 --> 3923.44]  brothers and
[3923.44 --> 3924.00]  sisters in
[3924.00 --> 3924.48]  all our
[3924.48 --> 3925.38]  distress and
[3925.38 --> 3926.32]  persecution we
[3926.32 --> 3927.48]  were encouraged
[3927.48 --> 3928.56]  about you
[3928.56 --> 3929.60]  because of
[3929.60 --> 3930.98]  your faith.
[3931.80 --> 3932.16]  Right?
[3932.20 --> 3932.76]  In the face
[3932.76 --> 3933.32]  of Paul's
[3933.32 --> 3934.18]  own trials
[3934.18 --> 3935.30]  in the face
[3935.30 --> 3935.80]  of his own
[3935.80 --> 3936.40]  suffering and
[3936.40 --> 3937.40]  persecution he
[3937.40 --> 3938.14]  is encouraged
[3938.14 --> 3939.68]  by the stories
[3939.68 --> 3940.42]  of their
[3940.42 --> 3941.24]  faithfulness
[3941.24 --> 3942.06]  in trial.
[3943.28 --> 3943.50]  Right?
[3943.54 --> 3944.12]  Here's the thing
[3944.12 --> 3944.46]  from that.
[3944.52 --> 3944.86]  This is what
[3944.86 --> 3945.12]  we've been
[3945.12 --> 3945.58]  saying that
[3945.58 --> 3946.60]  stories about
[3946.60 --> 3947.42]  your faith
[3947.42 --> 3948.48]  fuels my
[3948.48 --> 3948.88]  faith.
[3949.92 --> 3950.44]  And stories
[3950.44 --> 3951.06]  about his
[3951.06 --> 3951.86]  faith fuels
[3951.86 --> 3952.52]  her faith.
[3954.10 --> 3954.34]  Right?
[3954.38 --> 3954.76]  And stories
[3954.76 --> 3955.34]  about their
[3955.34 --> 3956.08]  faith fuel
[3956.08 --> 3956.88]  our faith.
[3957.48 --> 3958.38]  Telling
[3958.38 --> 3959.12]  these stories
[3959.12 --> 3959.64]  is part
[3959.64 --> 3959.98]  of what
[3959.98 --> 3961.02]  God does
[3961.02 --> 3961.52]  and uses
[3961.52 --> 3962.54]  to preserve
[3962.54 --> 3963.22]  us in
[3963.22 --> 3963.56]  our own
[3963.56 --> 3964.00]  trials.
[3965.28 --> 3965.66]  How many
[3965.66 --> 3968.20]  times has
[3968.20 --> 3969.58]  sharing your
[3969.58 --> 3970.62]  story come
[3970.62 --> 3971.62]  back to you
[3971.62 --> 3972.86]  as something
[3972.86 --> 3973.38]  that has
[3973.38 --> 3973.86]  helped another
[3973.86 --> 3974.58]  person right
[3974.58 --> 3974.86]  when they
[3974.86 --> 3975.30]  needed it?
[3976.40 --> 3976.82]  Or when
[3976.82 --> 3977.74]  hearing stories
[3977.74 --> 3978.48]  of God at
[3978.48 --> 3978.86]  work in
[3978.86 --> 3979.28]  some other
[3979.28 --> 3979.98]  situation
[3979.98 --> 3981.86]  can be used
[3981.86 --> 3982.54]  by God to
[3982.54 --> 3983.32]  encourage your
[3983.32 --> 3983.84]  heart that
[3983.84 --> 3984.48]  he's at work
[3984.48 --> 3984.94]  in your
[3984.94 --> 3985.54]  situation?
[3985.54 --> 3990.12]  Now with
[3990.12 --> 3991.14]  that, here's
[3991.14 --> 3991.60]  what I hope
[3991.60 --> 3992.84]  you can hear.
[3994.42 --> 3994.90]  Right?
[3994.96 --> 3995.70]  These stories
[3995.70 --> 3996.38]  matter.
[3997.54 --> 3998.46]  Your story
[3998.46 --> 3999.28]  matters.
[3999.82 --> 4000.22]  No matter
[4000.22 --> 4001.26]  how minuscule
[4001.26 --> 4002.18]  it seems
[4002.18 --> 4002.64]  in the
[4002.64 --> 4003.00]  moment,
[4003.38 --> 4003.88]  God can
[4003.88 --> 4004.50]  use your
[4004.50 --> 4005.18]  story to
[4005.18 --> 4005.70]  change a
[4005.70 --> 4006.04]  life.
[4007.26 --> 4007.52]  And no
[4007.52 --> 4007.96]  matter how
[4007.96 --> 4008.62]  much of a
[4008.62 --> 4009.26]  story in
[4009.26 --> 4010.48]  progress you
[4010.48 --> 4010.92]  might be
[4010.92 --> 4011.32]  or how much
[4011.32 --> 4011.84]  of a work
[4011.84 --> 4012.50]  in progress
[4012.50 --> 4013.20]  your life
[4013.20 --> 4014.68]  of discipleship
[4014.68 --> 4015.42]  might be,
[4015.54 --> 4016.30]  your story
[4016.30 --> 4017.12]  can be used
[4017.12 --> 4017.74]  by a sovereign
[4017.74 --> 4018.18]  God to
[4018.18 --> 4019.42]  encourage someone
[4019.42 --> 4020.06]  in the midst
[4020.06 --> 4020.40]  of their
[4020.40 --> 4020.86]  story.
[4022.78 --> 4023.66]  And so,
[4023.86 --> 4024.36]  really,
[4024.82 --> 4025.32]  practically,
[4026.62 --> 4027.34]  how you
[4027.34 --> 4028.02]  tell these
[4028.02 --> 4028.70]  stories
[4028.70 --> 4029.64]  matters.
[4031.74 --> 4032.46]  How you
[4032.46 --> 4032.94]  tell these
[4032.94 --> 4033.38]  stories
[4033.38 --> 4034.20]  matters.
[4034.38 --> 4034.78]  When you
[4034.78 --> 4035.28]  tell the
[4035.28 --> 4035.86]  stories of
[4035.86 --> 4036.26]  God at
[4036.26 --> 4036.66]  work in
[4036.66 --> 4037.08]  your life,
[4037.96 --> 4038.42]  tell them
[4038.42 --> 4038.94]  in a way
[4038.94 --> 4039.42]  that makes
[4039.42 --> 4040.06]  Jesus the
[4040.06 --> 4040.38]  hero.
[4040.38 --> 4040.48]  So,
[4040.48 --> 4043.64]  let me
[4043.64 --> 4043.84]  give you
[4043.84 --> 4044.14]  an example.
[4044.24 --> 4044.70]  It sounds
[4044.70 --> 4045.48]  like two
[4045.48 --> 4046.32]  very different
[4046.32 --> 4047.34]  things to
[4047.34 --> 4047.66]  say,
[4048.12 --> 4048.46]  man,
[4048.58 --> 4049.06]  that was
[4049.06 --> 4049.84]  so hard.
[4050.06 --> 4050.78]  We barely
[4050.78 --> 4051.28]  made it
[4051.28 --> 4051.56]  through.
[4051.82 --> 4052.14]  There were
[4052.14 --> 4052.54]  so many
[4052.54 --> 4053.06]  times where
[4053.06 --> 4053.46]  I thought
[4053.46 --> 4053.98]  we were
[4053.98 --> 4054.26]  just going
[4054.26 --> 4054.60]  to give
[4054.60 --> 4054.86]  up,
[4055.48 --> 4055.80]  but I
[4055.80 --> 4056.24]  figured it
[4056.24 --> 4056.90]  out and
[4056.90 --> 4057.24]  we got
[4057.24 --> 4057.54]  there.
[4059.24 --> 4059.68]  Versus,
[4060.56 --> 4060.96]  man,
[4061.06 --> 4061.46]  that was
[4061.46 --> 4062.32]  so hard.
[4062.52 --> 4063.02]  I didn't
[4063.02 --> 4063.40]  think we
[4063.40 --> 4063.76]  would make
[4063.76 --> 4064.10]  it through.
[4064.20 --> 4064.44]  There were
[4064.44 --> 4064.94]  so many
[4064.94 --> 4065.80]  times that
[4065.80 --> 4066.20]  I wanted
[4066.20 --> 4066.60]  to give
[4066.60 --> 4066.78]  up.
[4066.84 --> 4067.08]  But you
[4067.08 --> 4067.42]  know who
[4067.42 --> 4067.92]  never gave
[4067.92 --> 4068.10]  up?
[4068.42 --> 4069.08]  Jesus never
[4069.08 --> 4069.52]  gave up.
[4069.80 --> 4070.32]  God never
[4070.32 --> 4070.74]  let go
[4070.74 --> 4071.04]  of me.
[4071.30 --> 4071.58]  Even
[4071.58 --> 4072.00]  when I
[4072.00 --> 4072.34]  couldn't
[4072.34 --> 4073.04]  feel him,
[4073.12 --> 4073.72]  I know
[4073.72 --> 4074.12]  in my
[4074.12 --> 4074.60]  heart of
[4074.60 --> 4075.26]  faith that
[4075.26 --> 4075.54]  I was
[4075.54 --> 4075.84]  in his
[4075.84 --> 4076.16]  hands.
[4077.30 --> 4077.88]  That's a
[4077.88 --> 4078.66]  different story.
[4079.84 --> 4080.26]  And I
[4080.26 --> 4080.68]  think some
[4080.68 --> 4081.16]  of us are
[4081.16 --> 4081.86]  scared to
[4081.86 --> 4082.28]  talk that
[4082.28 --> 4082.50]  way.
[4084.98 --> 4085.80]  But maybe
[4085.80 --> 4087.68]  we should
[4087.68 --> 4088.06]  be more
[4088.06 --> 4089.28]  scared to
[4089.28 --> 4089.66]  not see
[4089.66 --> 4090.16]  God act
[4090.16 --> 4090.62]  that way.
[4091.86 --> 4092.48]  Maybe we
[4092.48 --> 4092.72]  should be
[4092.72 --> 4093.48]  more concerned
[4093.48 --> 4094.32]  to reveal
[4094.32 --> 4094.96]  God in the
[4094.96 --> 4095.30]  midst of
[4095.30 --> 4095.74]  these kinds
[4095.74 --> 4096.26]  of moments.
[4096.26 --> 4097.26]  God's
[4097.26 --> 4097.42]  love.
[4097.42 --> 4097.82]  This is
[4097.82 --> 4098.26]  where the
[4098.26 --> 4098.90]  good
[4098.90 --> 4099.46]  doctrine
[4099.46 --> 4100.60]  of our
[4100.60 --> 4101.54]  perseverance
[4101.54 --> 4103.42]  because of
[4103.42 --> 4103.70]  God's
[4103.70 --> 4104.20]  preservation,
[4104.54 --> 4104.88]  where the
[4104.88 --> 4105.44]  good doctrine
[4105.44 --> 4105.86]  of that
[4105.86 --> 4106.56]  hits the
[4106.56 --> 4107.08]  hard mat
[4107.08 --> 4107.60]  of life.
[4108.32 --> 4108.74]  Where the
[4108.74 --> 4109.22]  rubber of
[4109.22 --> 4109.68]  the doctrine
[4109.68 --> 4110.16]  of God's
[4110.16 --> 4110.52]  sovereignty
[4110.52 --> 4111.04]  hits the
[4111.04 --> 4111.32]  road.
[4112.26 --> 4112.46]  Make
[4112.46 --> 4113.20]  Jesus the
[4113.20 --> 4113.78]  hero of
[4113.78 --> 4113.94]  your
[4113.94 --> 4114.44]  stories.
[4116.20 --> 4116.56]  Second,
[4116.74 --> 4117.00]  when you
[4117.00 --> 4117.70]  tell these
[4117.70 --> 4118.62]  stories,
[4119.78 --> 4120.82]  support your
[4120.82 --> 4121.66]  stories and
[4121.66 --> 4122.32]  your claims
[4122.32 --> 4123.36]  about God
[4123.36 --> 4124.22]  from the
[4124.22 --> 4124.50]  Bible.
[4125.52 --> 4126.26]  Tell your
[4126.26 --> 4127.16]  story within
[4127.16 --> 4128.08]  the Bible's
[4128.08 --> 4128.86]  own story.
[4129.36 --> 4129.66]  Weave
[4129.66 --> 4130.64]  Scripture into
[4130.64 --> 4131.56]  your stories in
[4131.56 --> 4132.32]  such a way that
[4132.32 --> 4133.54]  your voice and
[4133.54 --> 4134.14]  the voice of
[4134.14 --> 4135.00]  God stitch
[4135.00 --> 4135.72]  together in
[4135.72 --> 4136.76]  beautiful and
[4136.76 --> 4137.58]  compelling ways.
[4138.88 --> 4139.70]  That way you're
[4139.70 --> 4141.20]  also testing your
[4141.20 --> 4142.28]  own understanding
[4142.28 --> 4143.86]  of God at work
[4143.86 --> 4144.44]  in the world
[4144.44 --> 4145.24]  through God's
[4145.24 --> 4146.20]  own revelation
[4146.20 --> 4147.08]  of his work
[4147.08 --> 4147.66]  in the world.
[4148.96 --> 4149.82]  Testing that
[4149.82 --> 4150.54]  truth against
[4150.54 --> 4151.70]  Scripture actually
[4151.70 --> 4152.44]  seeks to
[4152.44 --> 4153.06]  heighten
[4153.06 --> 4154.58]  your confidence
[4154.58 --> 4155.48]  in the truth
[4155.48 --> 4156.26]  of how God
[4156.26 --> 4156.94]  uses your
[4156.94 --> 4157.64]  story to
[4157.64 --> 4158.22]  proclaim the
[4158.22 --> 4158.62]  gospel.
[4160.66 --> 4161.56]  God will
[4161.56 --> 4162.44]  not contradict
[4162.44 --> 4163.10]  himself.
[4164.00 --> 4164.62]  He can't.
[4165.24 --> 4165.62]  It goes
[4165.62 --> 4166.12]  against his
[4166.12 --> 4166.46]  nature.
[4167.64 --> 4168.12]  And so when
[4168.12 --> 4168.82]  your telling
[4168.82 --> 4169.68]  of God's
[4169.68 --> 4170.42]  work in the
[4170.42 --> 4171.84]  world aligns
[4171.84 --> 4172.50]  with what God
[4172.50 --> 4173.00]  has said
[4173.00 --> 4174.30]  about himself,
[4174.52 --> 4175.22]  you can be
[4175.22 --> 4175.98]  even more
[4175.98 --> 4177.06]  sure that
[4177.06 --> 4177.78]  God is
[4177.78 --> 4178.42]  with you.
[4179.98 --> 4181.00]  Make Jesus
[4181.00 --> 4181.74]  the hero of
[4181.74 --> 4182.34]  your stories
[4182.34 --> 4183.18]  and then tell
[4183.18 --> 4183.86]  your story
[4183.86 --> 4184.60]  from within
[4184.60 --> 4185.18]  the Bible
[4185.18 --> 4185.70]  story.
[4187.02 --> 4187.26]  And then
[4187.26 --> 4187.64]  lastly,
[4187.80 --> 4188.22]  and here's a
[4188.22 --> 4188.88]  really important
[4188.88 --> 4189.48]  one for some
[4189.48 --> 4189.88]  of you this
[4189.88 --> 4190.16]  morning,
[4191.42 --> 4191.98]  you don't
[4191.98 --> 4192.44]  need to
[4192.44 --> 4193.04]  fake a good
[4193.04 --> 4193.36]  ending.
[4195.78 --> 4196.78]  A story in
[4196.78 --> 4198.52]  progress is
[4198.52 --> 4199.10]  the story we
[4199.10 --> 4199.54]  need to hear.
[4201.30 --> 4202.14]  A work of
[4202.14 --> 4202.64]  God in
[4202.64 --> 4203.42]  progress is a
[4203.42 --> 4204.22]  great story.
[4205.38 --> 4205.88]  And part of
[4205.88 --> 4206.34]  what that means
[4206.34 --> 4206.98]  is that your
[4206.98 --> 4207.76]  story, even
[4207.76 --> 4208.50]  your work in
[4208.50 --> 4209.48]  progress story,
[4209.48 --> 4210.18]  even your
[4210.18 --> 4211.06]  unresolved,
[4211.48 --> 4212.02]  still in the
[4212.02 --> 4212.82]  midst of turmoil
[4212.82 --> 4214.34]  situation, is
[4214.34 --> 4216.32]  a story that
[4216.32 --> 4218.06]  we need to
[4218.06 --> 4218.32]  hear.
[4220.02 --> 4221.02]  In fact, this
[4221.02 --> 4221.68]  leaves us without
[4221.68 --> 4222.64]  any excuse,
[4222.88 --> 4223.66]  really, for not
[4223.66 --> 4224.52]  telling your story
[4224.52 --> 4225.70]  of God at work
[4225.70 --> 4226.62]  and of God
[4226.62 --> 4227.92]  working or of
[4227.92 --> 4228.68]  where you need
[4228.68 --> 4229.70]  God to be at
[4229.70 --> 4230.00]  work.
[4231.00 --> 4231.30]  Right?
[4231.34 --> 4231.88]  Your story
[4231.88 --> 4232.48]  doesn't have to
[4232.48 --> 4233.70]  be over or
[4233.70 --> 4234.36]  your situation
[4234.36 --> 4234.94]  doesn't have to
[4234.94 --> 4236.16]  be fixed for
[4236.16 --> 4236.94]  it to be used
[4236.94 --> 4237.52]  by God.
[4237.52 --> 4238.68]  And I think
[4238.68 --> 4239.52]  sometimes we
[4239.52 --> 4240.18]  get the idea
[4240.18 --> 4240.94]  that until we
[4240.94 --> 4241.40]  have it all
[4241.40 --> 4242.10]  figured out,
[4242.34 --> 4242.98]  until we've
[4242.98 --> 4243.52]  put ourselves
[4243.52 --> 4244.30]  back together,
[4244.50 --> 4245.30]  dusted ourselves
[4245.30 --> 4246.28]  off, and until
[4246.28 --> 4247.02]  we look prim
[4247.02 --> 4247.94]  and proper again,
[4248.18 --> 4249.18]  then we can't
[4249.18 --> 4250.26]  share this story.
[4251.44 --> 4252.66]  But that idea,
[4252.90 --> 4253.72]  entirely common
[4253.72 --> 4254.40]  as it is,
[4254.60 --> 4255.72]  is completely
[4255.72 --> 4257.10]  contradictory to
[4257.10 --> 4257.86]  the very reason
[4257.86 --> 4258.78]  why God uses
[4258.78 --> 4259.62]  these stories.
[4260.66 --> 4260.76]  Right?
[4260.80 --> 4261.30]  Instead of
[4261.30 --> 4262.14]  faking a good
[4262.14 --> 4263.38]  ending, fix
[4263.38 --> 4264.06]  your eyes on
[4264.06 --> 4264.66]  the grand
[4264.66 --> 4265.10]  ending.
[4265.94 --> 4266.04]  Right?
[4266.08 --> 4266.90]  Allow your
[4266.90 --> 4268.06]  story, incomplete
[4268.06 --> 4268.82]  as it is,
[4268.88 --> 4269.48]  to draw your
[4269.48 --> 4270.16]  eyes of faith
[4270.16 --> 4270.64]  and your hearts
[4270.64 --> 4271.16]  of love for
[4271.16 --> 4271.94]  God towards
[4271.94 --> 4272.72]  the end of
[4272.72 --> 4273.52]  His story,
[4273.88 --> 4274.36]  towards the
[4274.36 --> 4274.98]  return of
[4274.98 --> 4275.64]  Jesus Christ,
[4275.76 --> 4276.18]  towards the
[4276.18 --> 4277.46]  consummation of
[4277.46 --> 4278.40]  all that is,
[4278.46 --> 4279.14]  of all of
[4279.14 --> 4279.56]  history.
[4280.00 --> 4280.60]  Let the end
[4280.60 --> 4281.68]  of His story,
[4282.00 --> 4282.78]  His work in
[4282.78 --> 4283.20]  the world,
[4283.34 --> 4284.22]  be that which
[4284.22 --> 4284.94]  draws you
[4284.94 --> 4285.76]  towards the
[4285.76 --> 4286.34]  same end.
[4287.48 --> 4287.68]  Right?
[4287.74 --> 4288.42]  Don't fake a
[4288.42 --> 4288.96]  good ending,
[4289.14 --> 4289.84]  but fix your
[4289.84 --> 4290.44]  eyes on the
[4290.44 --> 4291.20]  great ending.
[4292.36 --> 4293.28]  Make Jesus
[4293.28 --> 4293.92]  the hero.
[4294.92 --> 4295.36]  Tell your
[4295.36 --> 4296.06]  story from
[4296.06 --> 4296.92]  within the
[4296.92 --> 4297.84]  Bible's story
[4297.84 --> 4298.80]  and fix your
[4298.80 --> 4299.88]  eyes on God's
[4299.88 --> 4301.26]  great ending.
[4303.10 --> 4303.90]  That's how you
[4303.90 --> 4304.44]  can tell your
[4304.44 --> 4305.70]  story in such
[4305.70 --> 4306.56]  a way that the
[4306.56 --> 4307.76]  gospel is
[4307.76 --> 4308.34]  proclaimed.
[4309.26 --> 4309.98]  That's how you
[4309.98 --> 4310.48]  can tell your
[4310.48 --> 4311.26]  story in such
[4311.26 --> 4312.36]  a way that it
[4312.36 --> 4313.64]  is easy for us
[4313.64 --> 4314.98]  to see God
[4314.98 --> 4315.62]  at work and
[4315.62 --> 4316.38]  how He is
[4316.38 --> 4316.98]  going to use
[4316.98 --> 4317.96]  it to preserve
[4317.96 --> 4318.88]  others.
[4320.60 --> 4321.26]  And then
[4321.26 --> 4321.64]  finally,
[4321.94 --> 4322.48]  lastly, and
[4322.48 --> 4323.48]  we'll land here
[4323.48 --> 4324.12]  this morning,
[4324.90 --> 4326.72]  all of this
[4326.72 --> 4328.66]  and all of
[4328.66 --> 4330.52]  this is
[4330.52 --> 4331.06]  what we pray
[4331.06 --> 4331.38]  for.
[4332.38 --> 4332.92]  Look at
[4332.92 --> 4333.34]  verse 10.
[4336.06 --> 4336.80]  Night and
[4336.80 --> 4337.66]  day we pray
[4337.66 --> 4338.86]  most earnestly
[4338.86 --> 4339.82]  that we may
[4339.82 --> 4340.68]  see you again
[4340.68 --> 4341.34]  and supply
[4341.34 --> 4342.32]  what is lacking
[4342.32 --> 4343.68]  in your faith.
[4343.80 --> 4344.12]  And then
[4344.12 --> 4344.52]  Paul,
[4346.24 --> 4347.16]  majestically,
[4348.48 --> 4349.04]  musically
[4349.04 --> 4349.74]  even,
[4350.16 --> 4350.84]  writes out
[4350.84 --> 4351.46]  his prayer.
[4352.82 --> 4353.56]  Now may
[4353.56 --> 4354.16]  our God
[4354.16 --> 4354.72]  and Father
[4354.72 --> 4355.50]  Himself and
[4355.50 --> 4355.98]  our Lord
[4355.98 --> 4356.84]  Jesus clear
[4356.84 --> 4357.68]  the way for
[4357.68 --> 4358.50]  us to come
[4358.50 --> 4358.98]  to you.
[4359.66 --> 4360.10]  And may
[4360.10 --> 4360.54]  the Lord
[4360.54 --> 4361.06]  make your
[4361.06 --> 4362.10]  love increase
[4362.10 --> 4363.00]  and overflow
[4363.00 --> 4363.72]  for each
[4363.72 --> 4364.20]  other and
[4364.20 --> 4364.92]  for everyone
[4364.92 --> 4365.56]  else just
[4365.56 --> 4366.14]  as ours
[4366.14 --> 4367.06]  does for
[4367.06 --> 4367.34]  you.
[4367.86 --> 4368.36]  And may
[4368.36 --> 4369.02]  He strengthen
[4369.02 --> 4369.62]  your hearts
[4369.62 --> 4370.38]  so that you
[4370.38 --> 4370.68]  will be
[4370.68 --> 4371.76]  blameless and
[4371.76 --> 4372.98]  holy in the
[4372.98 --> 4373.60]  presence of
[4373.60 --> 4374.24]  our God
[4374.24 --> 4374.80]  and Father
[4374.80 --> 4375.36]  when our
[4375.36 --> 4375.94]  Lord Jesus
[4375.94 --> 4377.02]  comes with
[4377.02 --> 4378.16]  all His
[4378.16 --> 4379.80]  holy ones.
[4380.84 --> 4382.66]  Now notice
[4382.66 --> 4384.34]  He doesn't
[4384.34 --> 4386.12]  pray that
[4386.12 --> 4386.56]  He might
[4386.56 --> 4387.10]  find a
[4387.10 --> 4388.16]  solution for
[4388.16 --> 4389.14]  His situation.
[4390.50 --> 4391.40]  He prays
[4391.40 --> 4391.74]  that God
[4391.74 --> 4392.28]  might provide
[4392.28 --> 4392.50]  one.
[4394.24 --> 4394.70]  And notice
[4394.70 --> 4395.16]  He doesn't
[4395.16 --> 4396.10]  pray for
[4396.10 --> 4396.78]  their suffering
[4396.78 --> 4397.48]  to end.
[4397.88 --> 4398.24]  Instead,
[4398.54 --> 4399.04]  He prays
[4399.04 --> 4399.28]  that they
[4399.28 --> 4399.80]  will endure.
[4401.50 --> 4402.06]  Right?
[4402.08 --> 4402.48]  He doesn't
[4402.48 --> 4403.06]  pray that
[4403.06 --> 4403.58]  their comfort
[4403.58 --> 4404.42]  would increase.
[4404.68 --> 4405.28]  He prays
[4405.28 --> 4405.56]  that their
[4405.56 --> 4406.42]  love for
[4406.42 --> 4406.86]  each other
[4406.86 --> 4407.56]  would increase.
[4408.58 --> 4409.20]  He doesn't
[4409.20 --> 4409.70]  pray that
[4409.70 --> 4410.28]  their lives
[4410.28 --> 4410.66]  would be
[4410.66 --> 4411.24]  easy.
[4411.68 --> 4411.98]  Instead,
[4412.18 --> 4412.72]  He prays
[4412.72 --> 4412.94]  that they
[4412.94 --> 4413.24]  would be
[4413.24 --> 4414.02]  blameless
[4414.02 --> 4415.30]  and holy.
[4417.40 --> 4418.44]  Stories of
[4418.44 --> 4418.88]  faith
[4418.88 --> 4419.86]  fueling
[4419.86 --> 4420.52]  and shaping
[4420.52 --> 4421.46]  our prayers
[4421.46 --> 4422.10]  of faith
[4422.10 --> 4423.82]  for the
[4423.82 --> 4424.16]  saints
[4424.16 --> 4425.08]  to stand
[4425.08 --> 4425.98]  firm.
[4427.00 --> 4427.90]  The stories
[4427.90 --> 4428.44]  that we
[4428.44 --> 4428.98]  tell of
[4428.98 --> 4429.40]  God at
[4429.40 --> 4430.02]  work in
[4430.02 --> 4430.44]  and through
[4430.44 --> 4431.14]  our trials
[4431.14 --> 4432.62]  even into
[4432.62 --> 4433.58]  the face
[4433.58 --> 4434.18]  of death
[4434.18 --> 4435.30]  are the
[4435.30 --> 4436.26]  stories that
[4436.26 --> 4437.04]  fuel our
[4437.04 --> 4437.50]  prayers
[4437.50 --> 4438.66]  and shape
[4438.66 --> 4438.68]  and shape
[4438.68 --> 4439.30]  what we
[4439.30 --> 4439.78]  ought to
[4439.78 --> 4440.38]  be praying
[4440.38 --> 4440.82]  for.
[4441.62 --> 4442.22]  So that
[4442.22 --> 4443.10]  God might
[4443.10 --> 4444.34]  preserve us
[4444.34 --> 4445.12]  to the end
[4445.12 --> 4446.02]  and we
[4446.02 --> 4446.50]  can be
[4446.50 --> 4447.30]  confident
[4447.30 --> 4449.96]  in our
[4449.96 --> 4451.00]  preservation
[4451.00 --> 4452.12]  and our
[4452.12 --> 4452.78]  perseverance
[4452.78 --> 4453.84]  that comes
[4453.84 --> 4454.28]  from it.
[4455.14 --> 4455.90]  Stories like
[4455.90 --> 4456.64]  this make
[4456.64 --> 4457.28]  the story
[4457.28 --> 4457.70]  of the
[4457.70 --> 4458.12]  gospel
[4458.12 --> 4459.36]  more real.
[4460.20 --> 4461.14]  Your story
[4461.14 --> 4461.86]  of faith
[4461.86 --> 4462.40]  even in
[4462.40 --> 4462.72]  trial,
[4462.84 --> 4463.54]  maybe especially
[4463.54 --> 4464.14]  in trial,
[4464.56 --> 4465.06]  makes the
[4465.06 --> 4465.84]  story of the
[4465.84 --> 4466.94]  gospel more
[4466.94 --> 4467.40]  real.
[4468.38 --> 4469.20]  And that
[4469.20 --> 4470.06]  is exactly
[4470.06 --> 4470.62]  what happens
[4470.62 --> 4470.96]  at this
[4470.96 --> 4471.26]  table.
[4472.50 --> 4473.56]  The story
[4473.56 --> 4474.14]  of faith
[4474.14 --> 4475.42]  made real.
[4475.80 --> 4476.22]  The story
[4476.22 --> 4476.86]  of the gospel
[4476.86 --> 4477.96]  comes to us
[4477.96 --> 4478.96]  in a form
[4478.96 --> 4479.46]  that we can
[4479.46 --> 4480.44]  taste and
[4480.44 --> 4480.84]  that we can
[4480.84 --> 4481.80]  see and
[4481.80 --> 4482.36]  the real
[4482.36 --> 4483.18]  presence of
[4483.18 --> 4484.24]  Jesus is
[4484.24 --> 4485.02]  here.
[4486.08 --> 4486.58]  So as we
[4486.58 --> 4487.06]  come to
[4487.06 --> 4487.66]  this table,
[4488.38 --> 4489.12]  I invite
[4489.12 --> 4490.06]  you to
[4490.06 --> 4491.38]  come hungry
[4491.38 --> 4493.02]  for Jesus.
[4494.12 --> 4494.72]  I invite
[4494.72 --> 4494.96]  you to
[4494.96 --> 4495.64]  come with
[4495.64 --> 4496.76]  your story
[4496.76 --> 4497.78]  ready to
[4497.78 --> 4498.46]  be shaped
[4498.46 --> 4499.24]  by God
[4499.24 --> 4499.86]  in this
[4499.86 --> 4500.42]  moment.
[4501.10 --> 4501.84]  That from
[4501.84 --> 4502.84]  him you
[4502.84 --> 4503.78]  might receive
[4503.78 --> 4505.90]  real grace
[4505.90 --> 4507.00]  and mercy.
[4507.14 --> 4507.60]  That from
[4507.60 --> 4508.14]  him you
[4508.14 --> 4509.24]  might receive
[4509.24 --> 4510.20]  the power
[4510.20 --> 4510.66]  of his
[4510.66 --> 4511.78]  spirit to
[4511.78 --> 4512.78]  persevere
[4512.78 --> 4514.06]  in whatever
[4514.06 --> 4515.36]  trial the
[4515.36 --> 4516.20]  Lord is
[4516.20 --> 4517.10]  calling you
[4517.10 --> 4517.68]  to.
[4517.80 --> 4518.76]  Because he
[4518.76 --> 4520.66]  is faithful
[4520.66 --> 4522.58]  and he
[4522.58 --> 4522.94]  will do
[4522.94 --> 4523.16]  it.
[4524.16 --> 4524.80]  Let me
[4524.80 --> 4525.16]  pray with
[4525.16 --> 4525.66]  you as
[4525.66 --> 4525.78]  we
[4525.78 --> 4526.00]  prepare
[4526.00 --> 4526.20]  our
[4526.20 --> 4526.40]  hearts
[4526.40 --> 4526.70]  to come
[4526.70 --> 4526.98]  to this
[4526.98 --> 4527.24]  table.
[4531.24 --> 4531.92]  Holy,
[4533.42 --> 4534.00]  majestic,
[4535.32 --> 4535.60]  mighty,
[4536.00 --> 4536.76]  and sovereign
[4536.76 --> 4537.58]  God,
[4538.28 --> 4541.20]  each one
[4541.20 --> 4541.60]  of us
[4541.60 --> 4542.88]  here you
[4542.88 --> 4543.64]  have carried
[4543.64 --> 4544.32]  to this
[4544.32 --> 4546.10]  place for
[4546.10 --> 4546.74]  a purpose
[4546.74 --> 4548.08]  to this
[4548.08 --> 4549.12]  moment that
[4549.12 --> 4549.64]  we might
[4549.64 --> 4550.56]  receive from
[4550.56 --> 4551.12]  you the
[4551.12 --> 4551.76]  grace of
[4551.76 --> 4552.24]  your word.
[4552.24 --> 4552.28]  God,
[4552.68 --> 4554.28]  we pray
[4554.28 --> 4554.74]  now that
[4554.74 --> 4554.98]  you would
[4554.98 --> 4555.46]  take the
[4555.46 --> 4556.00]  grace of
[4556.00 --> 4556.48]  your word
[4556.48 --> 4556.78]  and that
[4556.78 --> 4557.04]  you would
[4557.04 --> 4558.10]  transform it
[4558.10 --> 4558.72]  by the
[4558.72 --> 4559.28]  bread and
[4559.28 --> 4559.70]  the juice
[4559.70 --> 4560.06]  that we
[4560.06 --> 4560.60]  are about
[4560.60 --> 4560.94]  to eat,
[4561.02 --> 4561.64]  that in
[4561.64 --> 4561.92]  it we
[4561.92 --> 4562.86]  might experience
[4562.86 --> 4563.56]  the real
[4563.56 --> 4564.46]  presence of
[4564.46 --> 4565.12]  our Lord
[4565.12 --> 4566.24]  Jesus Christ.
[4566.36 --> 4567.18]  Meet us
[4567.18 --> 4567.94]  here, we
[4567.94 --> 4568.94]  pray, by
[4568.94 --> 4569.92]  grace through
[4569.92 --> 4570.74]  faith.
[4572.40 --> 4573.20]  May we
[4573.20 --> 4574.18]  receive from
[4574.18 --> 4576.02]  you sustaining
[4576.02 --> 4576.92]  power.
[4576.92 --> 4576.98]  power.
[4577.86 --> 4578.66]  May we
[4578.66 --> 4579.42]  receive from
[4579.42 --> 4581.58]  you preserving
[4581.58 --> 4584.40]  power that
[4584.40 --> 4584.82]  we might
[4584.82 --> 4586.64]  persevere into
[4586.64 --> 4587.26]  whatever dark
[4587.26 --> 4587.72]  night of the
[4587.72 --> 4588.66]  soul we face,
[4589.18 --> 4589.68]  into whatever
[4589.68 --> 4590.98]  moment of
[4590.98 --> 4591.68]  death we are
[4591.68 --> 4592.24]  looking down
[4592.24 --> 4592.88]  upon, into
[4592.88 --> 4593.70]  whatever abyss
[4593.70 --> 4594.56]  we stare, to
[4594.56 --> 4595.28]  whatever trial
[4595.28 --> 4596.22]  and persecution
[4596.22 --> 4597.52]  you call us to
[4597.52 --> 4598.84]  go in this
[4598.84 --> 4599.48]  moment.
[4601.20 --> 4602.20]  Preserve us
[4602.20 --> 4605.56]  that we
[4605.56 --> 4606.38]  might persevere
[4606.38 --> 4607.74]  to the end.
[4609.28 --> 4610.06]  May this
[4610.06 --> 4610.94]  feast be for
[4610.94 --> 4611.88]  us a glimpse
[4611.88 --> 4612.92]  of your great
[4612.92 --> 4614.22]  feast to come,
[4614.32 --> 4614.94]  that heavenly
[4614.94 --> 4616.02]  banquet at the
[4616.02 --> 4616.88]  end of time
[4616.88 --> 4618.32]  that draws us
[4618.32 --> 4619.36]  forward in
[4619.36 --> 4620.72]  obedience to
[4620.72 --> 4621.28]  your word,
[4621.94 --> 4623.30]  to your will,
[4624.36 --> 4624.94]  that we might
[4624.94 --> 4625.58]  be disciples
[4625.58 --> 4626.54]  who follow in
[4626.54 --> 4627.62]  the way of
[4627.62 --> 4627.94]  Jesus,
[4628.84 --> 4630.92]  that we might
[4630.92 --> 4631.40]  bear in our
[4631.40 --> 4632.18]  bodies the
[4632.18 --> 4632.92]  death of
[4632.92 --> 4634.64]  Jesus, that
[4634.64 --> 4635.20]  we might also
[4635.20 --> 4635.68]  bear in our
[4635.68 --> 4636.36]  bodies his
[4636.36 --> 4637.22]  resurrecting
[4637.22 --> 4637.92]  power.
[4639.46 --> 4640.42]  We pray this
[4640.42 --> 4641.00]  Jesus in your
[4641.00 --> 4641.68]  holy name.
[4642.44 --> 4642.72]  Amen.
[4644.34 --> 4644.74]  Amen.
[4650.08 --> 4651.12]  As we come
[4651.12 --> 4652.30]  to this table
[4652.30 --> 4653.76]  together, we
[4653.76 --> 4654.68]  have opportunity
[4654.68 --> 4656.94]  to stand in
[4656.94 --> 4658.14]  the 2,000
[4658.14 --> 4659.10]  year history
[4659.10 --> 4659.74]  of the
[4659.74 --> 4660.70]  Christian church
[4660.70 --> 4662.26]  to live
[4662.26 --> 4663.20]  out this
[4663.20 --> 4664.06]  feast of
[4664.06 --> 4664.86]  anticipation.
[4665.82 --> 4666.30]  And so part
[4666.30 --> 4666.98]  of the words
[4666.98 --> 4667.46]  that we are
[4667.46 --> 4668.04]  invited to
[4668.04 --> 4668.68]  say here
[4668.68 --> 4669.94]  connect us
[4669.94 --> 4670.66]  back all
[4670.66 --> 4671.66]  the way to
[4671.66 --> 4671.96]  the very
[4671.96 --> 4673.08]  institution of
[4673.08 --> 4673.88]  this meal in
[4673.88 --> 4674.54]  our Lord Jesus
[4674.54 --> 4675.24]  Christ, to the
[4675.24 --> 4676.08]  very practice of
[4676.08 --> 4677.00]  it in the early
[4677.00 --> 4677.74]  church, and to
[4677.74 --> 4678.48]  the very words
[4678.48 --> 4679.42]  spoken by the
[4679.42 --> 4680.10]  church throughout
[4680.10 --> 4681.22]  the ages.
[4681.72 --> 4682.54]  And so together
[4682.54 --> 4683.64]  with one voice,
[4684.12 --> 4684.76]  lift up your
[4684.76 --> 4685.16]  hearts.
[4685.16 --> 4688.60]  let us give
[4688.60 --> 4689.30]  thanks to the
[4689.30 --> 4689.76]  Lord our
[4689.76 --> 4690.10]  God.
[4692.96 --> 4693.62]  Let's pray
[4693.62 --> 4694.02]  together.
[4695.70 --> 4696.84]  With joy we
[4696.84 --> 4697.62]  praise you,
[4697.80 --> 4698.52]  gracious God,
[4698.58 --> 4699.12]  for you have
[4699.12 --> 4699.92]  created heaven
[4699.92 --> 4700.56]  and earth.
[4701.10 --> 4701.52]  You have made
[4701.52 --> 4702.02]  us in your
[4702.02 --> 4702.76]  image and kept
[4702.76 --> 4703.50]  covenant with
[4703.50 --> 4704.48]  us even when
[4704.48 --> 4705.26]  we fell into
[4705.26 --> 4705.58]  sin.
[4706.44 --> 4707.06]  We give you
[4707.06 --> 4707.60]  thanks for
[4707.60 --> 4708.36]  Jesus Christ,
[4708.48 --> 4708.96]  who by his
[4708.96 --> 4709.72]  life, death,
[4709.80 --> 4710.40]  and resurrection
[4710.40 --> 4711.84]  opened to us
[4711.84 --> 4712.70]  the way of
[4712.70 --> 4713.92]  life everlasting.
[4713.92 --> 4715.26]  Amen.
[4718.02 --> 4718.98]  Now our Lord
[4718.98 --> 4720.62]  Jesus, before
[4720.62 --> 4722.24]  he suffered, gave
[4722.24 --> 4723.52]  us this memorial
[4723.52 --> 4724.80]  of his sacrifice
[4724.80 --> 4725.70]  until he comes
[4725.70 --> 4726.04]  again.
[4727.02 --> 4727.86]  The Lord Jesus,
[4728.16 --> 4728.76]  on the night
[4728.76 --> 4730.12]  that he was
[4730.12 --> 4731.10]  betrayed, he
[4731.10 --> 4732.48]  took bread, and
[4732.48 --> 4732.82]  when he had
[4732.82 --> 4733.94]  given thanks, he
[4733.94 --> 4735.58]  broke it, and
[4735.58 --> 4736.90]  he said, this
[4736.90 --> 4738.40]  is my body,
[4738.92 --> 4739.74]  which is for
[4739.74 --> 4740.00]  you.
[4740.64 --> 4741.82]  Do this in
[4741.82 --> 4743.28]  remembrance of
[4743.28 --> 4743.54]  me.
[4743.92 --> 4745.90]  And in the
[4745.90 --> 4747.26]  same way, after
[4747.26 --> 4747.88]  supper, he
[4747.88 --> 4748.64]  took the cup
[4748.64 --> 4749.72]  and said, this
[4749.72 --> 4750.74]  cup is the
[4750.74 --> 4751.38]  new covenant
[4751.38 --> 4752.82]  in my blood.
[4753.74 --> 4754.52]  Do this
[4754.52 --> 4755.48]  whenever you
[4755.48 --> 4756.54]  drink it in
[4756.54 --> 4757.96]  remembrance of
[4757.96 --> 4758.24]  me.
[4758.80 --> 4759.70]  For whenever you
[4759.70 --> 4760.66]  eat this bread
[4760.66 --> 4761.84]  and drink this
[4761.84 --> 4762.74]  cup, you
[4762.74 --> 4763.86]  proclaim the
[4763.86 --> 4764.70]  Lord's death
[4764.70 --> 4766.12]  until he
[4766.12 --> 4767.32]  comes again.
[4768.02 --> 4769.44]  This is the
[4769.44 --> 4770.58]  mystery of
[4770.58 --> 4771.28]  our faith.
[4771.28 --> 4773.96]  your death, O
[4773.96 --> 4774.74]  Christ, we
[4774.74 --> 4775.24]  proclaim.
[4776.06 --> 4777.00]  Your resurrection
[4777.00 --> 4778.24]  we affirm with
[4778.24 --> 4778.60]  joy.
[4779.36 --> 4780.32]  Your coming we
[4780.32 --> 4781.32]  await with hope.
[4782.10 --> 4783.14]  Glory be to
[4783.14 --> 4784.28]  you, Lord Jesus.
[4785.74 --> 4787.34]  Church family, the
[4787.34 --> 4788.20]  Lord has prepared
[4788.20 --> 4789.82]  his table for all
[4789.82 --> 4790.84]  who love him and
[4790.84 --> 4791.82]  for all who trust in
[4791.82 --> 4793.36]  him alone for their
[4793.36 --> 4793.84]  salvation.
[4794.02 --> 4795.04]  And so, come to
[4795.04 --> 4796.40]  this table, you who
[4796.40 --> 4797.98]  have much faith and
[4797.98 --> 4798.86]  you who would like to
[4798.86 --> 4799.38]  have more.
[4799.38 --> 4800.86]  Come to this table,
[4801.00 --> 4801.84]  you who have been
[4801.84 --> 4803.36]  here often and
[4803.36 --> 4804.32]  you who have not
[4804.32 --> 4805.88]  been for a long
[4805.88 --> 4806.46]  time.
[4807.30 --> 4808.32]  Come to this table,
[4808.46 --> 4809.38]  you who have tried
[4809.38 --> 4810.80]  to follow Jesus and
[4810.80 --> 4811.88]  you who have failed.
[4812.28 --> 4813.34]  Come to this table
[4813.34 --> 4814.86]  because Jesus Christ
[4814.86 --> 4816.36]  is raised.
[4817.20 --> 4818.00]  We invite you to
[4818.00 --> 4818.94]  come if you are here
[4818.94 --> 4819.98]  with us or if you
[4819.98 --> 4820.80]  are joining us
[4820.80 --> 4821.48]  online.
[4821.84 --> 4822.82]  Come because it is
[4822.82 --> 4823.88]  Christ who meets
[4823.88 --> 4825.52]  his gathered body
[4825.52 --> 4826.40]  here.
[4827.24 --> 4828.48]  The gifts of God
[4828.48 --> 4829.46]  for the people
[4829.46 --> 4830.42]  of God.
[4831.98 --> 4832.86]  As we come to
[4832.86 --> 4833.82]  this table here
[4833.82 --> 4835.20]  at Emmanuel, we
[4835.20 --> 4836.24]  have a particular
[4836.24 --> 4836.98]  way that we do
[4836.98 --> 4837.62]  that and so there
[4837.62 --> 4838.52]  will be some elders
[4838.52 --> 4839.48]  up here who will
[4839.48 --> 4840.82]  help serve as you
[4840.82 --> 4841.74]  are invited to the
[4841.74 --> 4842.00]  front.
[4842.16 --> 4842.80]  We will gather in
[4842.80 --> 4843.80]  a circle together
[4843.80 --> 4844.96]  and we will pass
[4844.96 --> 4845.94]  the elements around.
[4846.12 --> 4847.06]  As you pass the
[4847.06 --> 4848.06]  bread, we encourage
[4848.06 --> 4848.86]  you to say the
[4848.86 --> 4849.72]  body of Christ
[4849.72 --> 4850.52]  given for you.
[4851.18 --> 4852.14]  On the tray of
[4852.14 --> 4852.76]  bread in the
[4852.76 --> 4854.42]  center is a little
[4854.42 --> 4855.64]  tin of gluten-free
[4855.64 --> 4855.98]  bread.
[4856.06 --> 4856.70]  We encourage you if
[4856.70 --> 4857.26]  you need that to
[4857.26 --> 4857.64]  take that.
[4857.64 --> 4858.68]  We have some
[4858.68 --> 4859.38]  gluten-free bread
[4859.38 --> 4859.92]  that is also
[4859.92 --> 4861.04]  completely separated
[4861.04 --> 4861.60]  up here.
[4861.70 --> 4862.36]  If you need that,
[4862.42 --> 4863.12]  please just indicate
[4863.12 --> 4863.74]  and we will give
[4863.74 --> 4864.08]  you there.
[4864.76 --> 4865.68]  As you pass the
[4865.68 --> 4866.62]  juice, we invite
[4866.62 --> 4868.08]  you to say the
[4868.08 --> 4868.96]  blood of Christ
[4868.96 --> 4870.06]  shed for you.
[4871.12 --> 4872.24]  In this way, we
[4872.24 --> 4873.46]  are met by Jesus
[4873.46 --> 4874.88]  in his body
[4874.88 --> 4875.78]  together.
[4877.22 --> 4878.98]  Before we invite
[4878.98 --> 4879.74]  everyone to come
[4879.74 --> 4880.22]  up, I am going to
[4880.22 --> 4880.98]  invite those who
[4880.98 --> 4881.94]  will help facilitate
[4881.94 --> 4882.88]  and help serve.
[4883.02 --> 4883.90]  The worship team
[4883.90 --> 4884.48]  and the serving
[4884.48 --> 4886.02]  elders, people at
[4886.02 --> 4886.46]  the back of the
[4886.46 --> 4887.72]  house who can
[4887.72 --> 4888.58]  come up and
[4888.58 --> 4889.62]  they will receive
[4889.62 --> 4890.76]  first so that they
[4890.76 --> 4891.44]  can lead us in
[4891.44 --> 4892.60]  singing as the
[4892.60 --> 4894.08]  rest of you come
[4894.08 --> 4894.42]  forward.
[4894.72 --> 4895.46]  If you are looking
[4895.46 --> 4896.24]  for someone to pray
[4896.24 --> 4897.66]  with you before
[4897.66 --> 4898.28]  coming to the
[4898.28 --> 4899.12]  front or in space
[4899.12 --> 4899.70]  of coming to the
[4899.70 --> 4900.24]  front, there will be
[4900.24 --> 4901.46]  people in the foyer
[4901.46 --> 4902.64]  at the back as well.
[4903.30 --> 4904.20]  Invite the leaders to
[4904.20 --> 4904.82]  come up to the front
[4904.82 --> 4905.26]  of the front.
[4926.44 --> 4927.30]  Close the gap.

[4932.70 --> 4933.32]  given for you.
[4936.08 --> 4936.84]  Body of Christ
[4936.84 --> 4937.40]  given for you.

[4938.58 --> 4939.52]  given for you.
[4939.52 --> 4968.58]  Thank you.
[4968.58 --> 4975.72]  Eat and remember.

[4987.38 --> 4987.98]  shed for you.
[4991.22 --> 4992.02]  Blood of Christ

[5190.98 --> 5201.98]  We will say together, we will feast and weep no more.
[5201.98 --> 5224.68]  In the dark of night before the dawn, my soul be not afraid for the promised morning of how long.
