[1711.58 → 1717.58] Please forgive me.
[1717.58 → 1721.58] Oh, when I can't go.
[1721.58 → 1726.10] Lord, I need you.
[1726.10 → 1730.10] How I need you.
[1730.10 → 1736.10] To awake my soul.
[1736.10 → 1756.62] Let's stand as we hear words of assurance from God this morning.
[1756.62 → 1759.80] They come from Psalm 103.
[1759.80 → 1761.80] Psalm 103.
[1761.80 → 1765.80] The Lord is compassionate and gracious.
[1765.80 → 1769.38] Slow to anger, abounding in love.
[1769.38 → 1774.38] He will not always accuse, nor will he harbour his anger forever.
[1774.38 → 1780.38] He does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities.
[1780.38 → 1787.76] For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him.
[1787.76 → 1794.76] As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.
[1817.76 → 1822.76] Only by grace can we enter.
[1822.76 → 1827.76] Only by grace can we stand.
[1827.76 → 1837.76] Not by our human endeavour, but by the blood of the Lamb.
[1837.76 → 1846.76] Into your presence you call us, you call us to come.
[1846.76 → 1851.76] Into your presence we draw.
[1851.76 → 1856.76] Now by your grace we come.
[1856.76 → 1861.76] Now by your grace we come.
[1861.76 → 1873.76] Lord, if you mark our transgressions, who would stand?
[1873.76 → 1880.76] f centre the hand, Fenn.
[1880.76 → 1884.76] May we pray to your grace in Him, EE office, but by the blood of the Lamb.
[1884.76 → 1898.76] Now by grace God bless you,
[1898.76 → 1901.58] the blood of the Lamb.
[1905.72 → 1909.44] Only by grace can we enter.
[1910.80 → 1914.00] Only by grace can we stand.
[1915.84 → 1919.54] Not by our human endeavour,
[1919.54 → 1925.38] but by the blood of the Lamb.
[1925.38 → 1930.36] Into your presence you call us,
[1930.56 → 1934.26] you call us to come.
[1935.84 → 1940.62] Into your presence you draw us,
[1940.62 → 1944.68] now by your grace we come.
[1946.06 → 1950.10] Now by your grace we come.
[1955.38 → 1963.38] How see
[1963.38 → 1965.10] closed
[1965.10 → 1967.68] in
[1967.68 → 1996.38] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
[1996.38 → 2002.20] Has saved a wretch like me
[2002.20 → 2008.14] I was once lost, but now I'm found
[2008.14 → 2013.88] Was blind, but now I see
[2013.88 → 2022.56] T'was grace that taught my heart to fear
[2022.56 → 2027.56] And grace my fears relieved
[2027.56 → 2034.02] From precious years and days of fear
[2034.02 → 2037.56] And now I've heard me
[2037.56 → 2044.70] My chains are gone, I feel set free
[2044.70 → 2049.70] But now I see, Lord, I shall stop me
[2049.70 → 2053.70] And now I've heard me
[2053.70 → 2058.70] I've heard me, Lord, I'm found
[2058.70 → 2061.70] Amazing grace
[2061.70 → 2075.70] The Lord has promised good to me
[2075.70 → 2080.70] His word my hopes and yours
[2080.70 → 2085.70] He will my shield and fortune
[2085.70 → 2091.70] As long as I endure
[2091.70 → 2100.70] Through many dangers, toils and snails
[2100.70 → 2105.70] I have a weapon, Lord
[2105.70 → 2111.70] Till the waves of God be saved will start
[2111.70 → 2116.70] And grace will lead me home
[2116.70 → 2121.70] My chains are gone, I feel set free
[2121.70 → 2128.70] My God, my Saviour, my chains are gone, I feel free
[2128.70 → 2133.70] And my God's love is most delayed
[2133.70 → 2140.70] I am the love of amazing grace
[2140.70 → 2154.70] And deep in there ten thousand years
[2154.70 → 2159.70] They're shining as a star
[2159.70 → 2165.70] We know the saints will see the praise
[2165.70 → 2170.70] And when we hear the words begun
[2170.70 → 2176.70] My chains are gone, I feel set free
[2176.70 → 2181.70] My God, my Saviour, my Saviour, my Son free
[2181.70 → 2187.70] And like a flood, there's mercy made
[2187.70 → 2192.70] And an ending of amazing grace
[2192.70 → 2201.70] The Lord has promised good to me
[2201.70 → 2203.70] And if you are not the king
[2203.70 → 2206.70] I am the love of amazing grace
[2206.70 → 2209.70] And like a flood, there's mercy made
[2209.70 → 2213.70] And an ending of amazing grace
[2213.70 → 2216.70] This is my soul.
[2239.92 → 2240.60] Good morning.
[2240.76 → 2242.62] My name is Brenda, and I'm one of the deacons here.
[2242.62 → 2246.48] It is time for our offering this morning.
[2247.16 → 2251.58] Before that, I just want to actually give a plug for next week's offering.
[2252.04 → 2256.08] Our offering next week for Thanksgiving Sunday is for the food bank,
[2256.56 → 2263.16] and as this congregation has been an amazing support for our local Langley food bank,
[2263.68 → 2266.82] and next week we have opportunity to give of our gifts
[2266.82 → 2274.48] and also to bring non-perishable food items and such that you can bring up front next Sunday.
[2275.20 → 2281.00] For today, our offerings are for our ministry, the ministries of this church,
[2281.24 → 2284.76] and also for C10, which is commissioned to every nation.
[2284.76 → 2290.68] And I have a message here for you from Jody and Uriel.
[2291.62 → 2295.46] This morning the offering is for C10, Uriel and Jody Gonzalez.
[2296.16 → 2301.70] C10 is a missionary sending organization which helps missionaries like Uriel and myself
[2301.70 → 2304.84] fulfill the unique vision that God has given them.
[2305.44 → 2308.16] Through administrative support, they provide accountability
[2308.16 → 2311.44] and help the missionary actually get to the field.
[2312.08 → 2315.44] Through pastoral care, they help us remain effective and healthy.
[2316.10 → 2319.92] We are in contact with our pastoral care couple on a regular basis
[2319.92 → 2323.70] as they pray for us and make sure that we have what we need
[2323.70 → 2325.90] to do the ministry that we have been called to.
[2326.86 → 2332.10] Uriel and I have been on the mission field here in Rosarito, Mexico, for 13 years.
[2332.46 → 2333.38] It's a long time.
[2333.38 → 2336.90] You might be wondering what we do all the way over here in Mexico.
[2338.04 → 2341.78] Uriel runs a men's clean and sober living home called El Faro.
[2342.32 → 2348.06] El Faro Men's Home continues to be a place where men struggling to get back into society
[2348.06 → 2351.74] can come and receive the help and the discipline that they need.
[2352.42 → 2359.88] We have men who work for a security company, as a call centre agent, or as a mobile mechanic.
[2359.88 → 2366.44] Without a home like El Faro, these men would not have an address to give their potential employer.
[2367.14 → 2370.44] Without a physical address, you will not be hired here.
[2371.16 → 2376.02] Life isn't always easy at El Faro, but in the end, we all realize that it is a blessing
[2376.02 → 2378.76] to have the doors open and a bed available when needed.
[2379.70 → 2381.70] Uriel also works as a security guard.
[2382.14 → 2386.54] This is to show the men that it is important to work, to go to church,
[2386.62 → 2388.22] and to be present with your family.
[2388.22 → 2393.48] I, Jody, am the English Women's Ministry Leader at Calvary Chapel Rosarito.
[2393.96 → 2395.74] I teach a Bible study on Friday mornings.
[2396.20 → 2401.34] I am a Connections House breakfast cook and have started a crafting ministry called Interwoven.
[2401.84 → 2405.50] We are also raising two young men, Jonathan and Antonio,
[2405.88 → 2411.32] who are bilingual and are available to help when teams staying at Connections House need translators.
[2411.86 → 2413.88] I've been told that they're a joy to be around.
[2413.88 → 2420.02] Your financial support through the offering today is a huge blessing to our family.
[2420.76 → 2425.28] It allows us to serve freely in the ministry areas that God has called us to be in.
[2425.58 → 2426.04] Thank you.
[2426.50 → 2429.52] We cherish your support through your prayers and your finances.
[2430.06 → 2433.06] In Christ, Uriel, Jody, Jonathan and Antonio.
[2433.06 → 2433.86] Just rise very well.
[2433.90 → 2434.20] Thank you, sure, able.
[2439.40 → 2441.26] We're still one of our small projects that we've done so much.
[2441.26 → 2446.06] Thank you, everyone.
[2446.58 → 2447.62] We're talking about some of our small projects that we've shown in many chapters.
[2447.62 → 2449.94] We're listening.
[2450.10 → 2451.38] jot the Kelly Consumer status ridden and justness of the world to be around Ms.
[2453.52 → 2454.44] Taylor's.
[2454.52 → 2455.54] What about vacuuming and audiologist?
[2455.64 → 2456.46] Can you really ask me here?
[2456.58 → 2457.46] Let's feel free to give hope
[2457.56 → 2458.20] and have to hear CD out.
[2458.26 → 2458.94] Every ship of you and our small You began круг.
[2459.02 → 2460.10] And make a video available today and there is part badgers across.
[2460.10 → 2461.02] And serving them.
[2461.12 → 2462.04] There is an Organization that they can help anything to be around.
[2462.04 → 2475.70] Let the Lord, O my soul, O my soul, worship His holy name.
[2475.70 → 2486.98] Sing my gala before, O my soul, I'll worship your holy name.
[2486.98 → 2496.58] The sun comes up, it's a new day, darling.
[2496.58 → 2501.88] It's time to sing your song again.
[2502.40 → 2508.54] Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me,
[2509.68 → 2515.52] let me be singing where the evening comes.
[2515.52 → 2528.32] Let the Lord, O my soul, O my soul, worship His holy name.
[2528.32 → 2540.32] Sing my gala before, O my soul, worship His holy name.
[2540.32 → 2554.52] Your rich in love and your soul, O my soul, your name is great, and your heart is mine.
[2554.52 → 2560.26] For all your goodness, I will keep on singing.
[2560.26 → 2567.26] Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.
[2567.26 → 2581.26] Let the Lord, O my soul, O my soul, worship His holy name.
[2581.26 → 2591.26] Sing my gala before, O my soul, my worship His holy name.
[2591.26 → 2601.26] And on that day when my strength is failing,
[2601.26 → 2606.26] The end broke here and my time has gone.
[2606.26 → 2620.26] Till my soul, O my soul, O my soul, O my soul, worship His holy name.
[2620.26 → 2632.26] Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul, worship His holy name.
[2632.26 → 2642.26] Sing my gala before, O my soul, O my soul, worship His holy name.
[2642.26 → 2654.26] Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul, worship His holy name.
[2654.26 → 2665.26] Sing my gala before, O my soul, I'll worship His holy name.
[2665.26 → 2690.26] Sing my gala before, O my soul, worship His holy name.
[2690.26 → 2691.26] Good morning, everybody.
[2691.26 → 2697.26] Can I have the preschoolers age three all the way up to grade four come up to the front today?
[2697.26 → 2707.26] Good morning.
[2707.26 → 2710.26] Oh, a few stragglers.
[2710.26 → 2711.26] Perfect.
[2711.26 → 2715.26] I have a question for you guys.
[2715.26 → 2722.26] Can you give me an example of something that you waited for a long time for, and you got it
[2722.26 → 2727.26] and it wasn't as exciting as you thought it would be?
[2727.26 → 2728.26] What do you think?
[2728.26 → 2732.26] A certain kind of candy.
[2732.26 → 2738.26] I know sometimes I have a candy and then the gum flavour doesn't last as long as you thought it would be.
[2738.26 → 2741.26] No candy.
[2741.26 → 2742.26] No candy.
[2742.26 → 2743.26] No candy.
[2743.26 → 2754.26] Or a certain kind of clothing that you, I know that sometimes you get clothing, and then it shrinks in the laundry so you don't have to have it as long as you want it to be.
[2754.26 → 2755.26] Right?
[2755.26 → 2764.26] So today in children's worship time we're going to talk about Solomon in Ecclesiastes and how he asked for some wisdom.
[2764.26 → 2770.26] And there are certain things he asked for that he thought would make him happy, but it didn't.
[2770.26 → 2775.26] So we're going to have a few things in children's worship time with bubbles and other things.
[2775.26 → 2777.26] So you'll have to tell your parents about that later.
[2777.26 → 2779.26] So can everybody stand up?
[2781.26 → 2783.26] And look towards the congregation.
[2783.26 → 2785.26] We're going to give the blessing.
[2785.26 → 2787.26] On one, two, three.
[2787.26 → 2788.26] The Lord.
[2788.26 → 2790.26] The Lord is with you.
[2790.26 → 2791.26] The Lord is with you.
[2800.26 → 2825.26] And we're going to in raised the Periods of Nurse and Lesions remotely, and we're going follow journal.
[2825.26 → 2826.26] Good morning.
[2826.26 → 2830.34] My name is PIM. I'm a pastoral elder here at Langley Emanuel.
[2831.40 → 2836.80] And as a liaison between council and the Safe Ministries team,
[2837.64 → 2840.76] just before the prayer, I have a short announcement from them
[2840.76 → 2845.04] about abuse prevention night with Kim Prince.
[2846.32 → 2849.86] All volunteers who work with vulnerable members of our church family
[2849.86 → 2852.78] are required to have this training every three years.
[2852.78 → 2857.60] And training will be happening on the 7th and the 21st.
[2858.90 → 2861.34] So please ensure that you are up-to-date,
[2861.52 → 2865.42] or especially if you're a new volunteer in our church family,
[2865.74 → 2868.76] be sure to attend on one of these days.
[2875.90 → 2881.60] Since 2025 is the 1700th birth year
[2881.60 → 2883.58] of one of our most important creeds,
[2883.88 → 2887.84] that is the Nicene Creed from 325 AD,
[2888.84 → 2893.66] I will structure our church family prayer for today after this creed.
[2895.86 → 2897.80] Just for some brief background,
[2898.04 → 2903.68] the creed matters because it solidifies our core beliefs in a Trinitarian God.
[2903.68 → 2912.00] Christ is fully divine with the Father and a fully divine Holy Spirit.
[2913.36 → 2919.16] So we don't sing hymns or pray to a creature named Jesus.
[2919.16 → 2925.02] No, we confess that he is one with the Father,
[2925.76 → 2928.16] God from God, light from light,
[2928.98 → 2930.90] true God from true God,
[2931.82 → 2933.78] begotten, not made.
[2935.44 → 2938.40] The creed, then, is a spiritual anchor
[2938.40 → 2943.16] for Catholics, Orthodox Christians, and Protestants alike.
[2943.16 → 2946.90] And it unites the church of all times and places
[2946.90 → 2949.06] in the truth and foundational role
[2949.06 → 2953.24] of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection.
[2954.26 → 2955.28] Let us pray.
[2958.44 → 2959.72] Heavenly Father,
[2960.28 → 2962.96] we are grateful that on this Sunday morning
[2962.96 → 2965.46] we may come before you in our family prayer.
[2965.46 → 2967.68] first,
[2968.46 → 2970.88] to praise you as our Father Almighty,
[2972.04 → 2973.34] maker of heaven and earth,
[2974.14 → 2976.58] and of all things visible and invisible.
[2978.46 → 2982.16] We thank you for your reign over all existence,
[2983.14 → 2986.70] both the material world and the spiritual realm,
[2987.40 → 2992.88] with its unseen thrones, dominions, rulers, and authorities.
[2992.88 → 2997.58] All is under your eternal care and providence,
[2997.92 → 3001.16] and we rest secure in that assurance.
[3003.34 → 3008.10] Thank you for everything you have graciously bestowed upon us this past week.
[3009.16 → 3009.78] Food,
[3010.98 → 3012.48] family and church community,
[3013.54 → 3013.90] shelter,
[3014.90 → 3015.52] work,
[3016.38 → 3016.74] health,
[3017.74 → 3018.32] peace,
[3019.60 → 3020.02] order,
[3021.30 → 3022.60] rain and sunshine,
[3022.88 → 3024.34] forgiveness,
[3025.02 → 3025.72] restoration,
[3027.02 → 3029.10] freedom from fear and anxiety.
[3029.80 → 3030.12] Indeed,
[3030.50 → 3031.64] our very adoption
[3031.64 → 3033.72] as your sons and daughters.
[3036.10 → 3036.78] And yet, Lord,
[3036.88 → 3038.78] as we thank you for all these blessings
[3038.78 → 3040.36] and many more,
[3041.74 → 3043.10] we also realize that
[3043.10 → 3044.96] countless our neighbours at home
[3044.96 → 3045.80] and abroad
[3045.80 → 3048.06] do not experience
[3048.06 → 3049.66] such a full flourishing
[3049.66 → 3050.62] of all your blessings.
[3050.62 → 3054.58] and so we pray for the homeless,
[3055.08 → 3056.30] the addicted,
[3057.14 → 3059.10] the orphans and the widows,
[3059.76 → 3061.64] the warmongers
[3061.64 → 3064.44] and the prisoners of war,
[3065.08 → 3067.14] the oppressors and the oppressed,
[3068.14 → 3069.98] the hungry and the thirsty,
[3070.98 → 3072.84] the mentally distressed
[3072.84 → 3075.22] and the physically ailing,
[3075.22 → 3078.70] the elderly and the unborn,
[3078.70 → 3082.10] the weak and the strong.
[3082.10 → 3085.46] Lord,
[3085.52 → 3087.02] it doesn't take much to realize
[3087.02 → 3088.48] we live in a broken world.
[3089.74 → 3090.18] Continue,
[3090.58 → 3091.10] we pray,
[3091.28 → 3091.94] to heal
[3091.94 → 3092.76] and restore
[3092.76 → 3093.66] your creation.
[3095.94 → 3097.44] We pray especially
[3097.44 → 3098.40] for Tessa,
[3099.50 → 3101.00] sister to Erica Last
[3101.00 → 3102.90] and daughter to Jerry Jansen.
[3102.90 → 3106.22] She will be operated on
[3106.22 → 3107.28] for colon cancer
[3107.28 → 3108.24] in about a week.
[3109.22 → 3110.32] Bring her full healing,
[3110.62 → 3110.82] Lord.
[3113.04 → 3114.14] We pray for
[3114.14 → 3115.26] Clary Klosterhoff's
[3115.26 → 3115.94] younger sister,
[3116.12 → 3116.44] Carolyn,
[3116.82 → 3119.10] who was in a dramatic
[3119.10 → 3120.22] head-on collision
[3120.22 → 3121.96] and finds herself
[3121.96 → 3123.04] on a long road
[3123.04 → 3123.76] to recovery
[3123.76 → 3126.02] from broken vertebrae
[3126.02 → 3128.20] and a serious head injury.
[3129.70 → 3130.94] We are grateful
[3130.94 → 3132.68] that there is no paralysis.
[3135.24 → 3137.30] Please restore her fully, Lord.
[3139.94 → 3141.78] We pray for John Buyers,
[3141.96 → 3143.30] who underwent a successful
[3143.30 → 3144.22] but painful
[3144.22 → 3145.92] scope procedure.
[3147.30 → 3148.52] Lord, bless him
[3148.52 → 3150.54] with a favourable diagnosis
[3150.54 → 3152.54] and much hope
[3152.54 → 3153.24] and courage
[3153.24 → 3154.28] in the days to come.
[3156.02 → 3159.18] Bless the many ministries
[3159.18 → 3159.82] at Emanuel
[3159.82 → 3161.32] in the new ministry season.
[3162.38 → 3163.70] We think especially
[3163.70 → 3165.30] of the Safe Ministries team,
[3165.68 → 3166.82] the ushers' ministry,
[3168.12 → 3169.62] the Bible reading class,
[3170.20 → 3170.62] cadets,
[3170.86 → 3171.20] gems,
[3171.96 → 3172.90] children's ministry,
[3173.14 → 3173.88] coffee break,
[3174.40 → 3175.34] the prayer hour,
[3176.20 → 3177.02] youth coffee,
[3177.38 → 3178.62] the nursery volunteers,
[3179.26 → 3180.58] the men's Bible study
[3180.58 → 3182.22] and our various
[3182.22 → 3183.48] care groups.
[3186.02 → 3190.48] Lord, you have blessed us richly
[3190.48 → 3191.90] and you continue
[3191.90 → 3193.18] to do so faithfully.
[3193.82 → 3194.72] We bring you
[3194.72 → 3196.34] our praise and gratitude.
[3199.18 → 3200.80] Together with you, Father,
[3200.96 → 3202.68] we also believe in one Lord,
[3202.96 → 3203.74] Jesus Christ,
[3204.56 → 3206.36] your only-begotten Son,
[3207.94 → 3209.02] begotten of you
[3209.02 → 3211.22] before all worlds,
[3211.22 → 3213.46] God of God,
[3213.66 → 3214.56] light of light,
[3215.16 → 3217.26] very God of very God,
[3218.30 → 3219.74] begotten, not made,
[3220.08 → 3221.32] being of one substance
[3221.32 → 3222.84] with you, Father,
[3223.40 → 3224.70] by whom all things
[3224.70 → 3225.44] were made,
[3227.14 → 3228.66] who, for us
[3228.66 → 3230.00] and for our salvation,
[3230.24 → 3231.30] came down from heaven
[3231.30 → 3233.20] and was incarnate
[3233.20 → 3234.46] by the Holy Spirit
[3234.46 → 3236.94] of the Virgin Mary
[3236.94 → 3239.62] and was made man
[3239.62 → 3242.46] and was crucified
[3242.46 → 3244.60] also for us
[3244.60 → 3247.12] under Pontius Pilate.
[3249.12 → 3250.08] He suffered
[3250.08 → 3250.86] and was buried
[3250.86 → 3251.78] and the third day
[3251.78 → 3252.66] he rose again
[3252.66 → 3253.82] according to the scriptures
[3253.82 → 3256.00] and ascended into heaven
[3256.00 → 3257.88] and sits on the right hand
[3257.88 → 3258.54] of the Father
[3258.54 → 3261.02] and he shall come again
[3261.02 → 3262.34] with glory
[3262.34 → 3263.42] to judge the living
[3263.42 → 3264.02] and the dead
[3264.02 → 3266.64] whose kingdom
[3266.64 → 3267.84] shall have no end.
[3270.12 → 3271.36] You, Lord Jesus,
[3271.50 → 3272.48] became incarnate
[3272.48 → 3273.38] and came to earth
[3273.38 → 3274.30] to save us
[3274.30 → 3275.16] from our sin
[3275.16 → 3276.68] and its consequences.
[3277.56 → 3278.94] We praise you
[3278.94 → 3280.58] for providing the rescue
[3280.58 → 3282.10] that we so clearly
[3282.10 → 3283.02] are incapable
[3283.02 → 3283.90] of achieving
[3283.90 → 3284.86] on our own
[3284.86 → 3286.96] and for offering
[3286.96 → 3287.58] forgiveness
[3287.58 → 3289.02] and the path
[3289.02 → 3290.08] to eternal life.
[3291.40 → 3293.16] Your double cure,
[3294.58 → 3295.16] that is,
[3295.70 → 3296.92] deliverance from sin
[3296.92 → 3299.46] and the transformative power
[3299.46 → 3300.34] to live a life
[3300.34 → 3302.12] free from sin's influence,
[3303.12 → 3304.90] makes us eternally grateful
[3304.90 → 3305.48] and humble.
[3307.16 → 3308.80] You came to seek
[3308.80 → 3309.46] and save
[3309.46 → 3310.80] that which was lost.
[3312.02 → 3313.86] Praise be to your holy name.
[3313.86 → 3317.88] Continue, we pray,
[3318.02 → 3319.26] to shepherd your flock
[3319.26 → 3320.18] with your strong
[3320.18 → 3321.12] and perfect plea.
[3323.36 → 3324.36] We praise you
[3324.36 → 3325.48] for having our names
[3325.48 → 3326.86] graven on your hands
[3326.86 → 3328.54] and written on your heart.
[3329.74 → 3331.00] Bless us with your work
[3331.00 → 3332.86] as our great high priest
[3332.86 → 3333.80] and advocate.
[3337.62 → 3338.78] Together with the Father
[3338.78 → 3339.38] and the Son,
[3339.48 → 3340.62] we also believe in you,
[3340.74 → 3341.50] Holy Spirit,
[3341.50 → 3343.84] Lord and giver of life.
[3345.12 → 3346.40] You proceed
[3346.40 → 3347.30] from the Father
[3347.30 → 3348.14] and the Son
[3348.14 → 3350.20] and with the Father
[3350.20 → 3351.18] and the Son together
[3351.18 → 3352.56] you are worshipped
[3352.56 → 3353.72] and glorified.
[3354.70 → 3355.42] You spoke
[3355.42 → 3356.26] by the prophets.
[3358.56 → 3359.80] We thank you,
[3360.38 → 3360.98] third person
[3360.98 → 3361.62] of the Trinity,
[3361.96 → 3362.84] for your spirit
[3362.84 → 3364.08] as the giver of life,
[3364.50 → 3366.12] for your active,
[3366.54 → 3367.00] personal,
[3367.62 → 3368.42] and fully
[3368.42 → 3369.62] divine
[3369.62 → 3370.72] presence.
[3371.50 → 3372.86] enabling us
[3372.86 → 3373.80] through conviction
[3373.80 → 3374.76] of our sin,
[3375.72 → 3376.24] renewal,
[3376.56 → 3377.50] and purification
[3377.50 → 3378.52] to live a life
[3378.52 → 3379.94] glorifying the Father
[3379.94 → 3381.06] and the Son.
[3383.92 → 3385.20] We also believe
[3385.20 → 3386.02] in one holy,
[3386.82 → 3387.40] universal,
[3387.84 → 3389.12] and apostolic church.
[3390.12 → 3391.36] We acknowledge
[3391.36 → 3392.48] one baptism
[3392.48 → 3393.66] for the remission
[3393.66 → 3394.34] of sins
[3394.34 → 3396.26] and we look
[3396.26 → 3396.98] for the resurrection
[3396.98 → 3397.72] of the dead
[3397.72 → 3399.06] and the life
[3399.06 → 3399.74] of the world
[3399.74 → 3400.48] to come.
[3400.92 → 3401.76] Amen.
[3401.76 → 3402.02] Amen.
[3402.02 → 3428.96] I want to invite you, as you have the capacity,
[3428.96 → 3432.06] to open your Bible, turn on your device.
[3432.34 → 3435.42] If you would like a Bible in hand, there's a couple at the back.
[3435.52 → 3437.46] I encourage you to grab one.
[3437.92 → 3441.54] We're going to continue our look at the book of Ecclesiastes
[3441.54 → 3445.62] by going now to the first chapter and the first verses.
[3446.34 → 3451.00] Last week, we began this series by looking at the end
[3451.00 → 3453.14] in order to understand where we were going.
[3453.28 → 3455.36] Now we're coming back to the beginning.
[3456.34 → 3459.72] If you missed last week and would like to recap it,
[3459.86 → 3461.58] you can find it on the church website.
[3462.28 → 3465.76] You can also every week listen to the podcast that we put out
[3465.76 → 3469.62] as a way of digging deep into some of these things a little bit more.
[3470.42 → 3473.18] I'm sure we will do the same again in the weeks to come.
[3474.66 → 3478.96] With that in mind, let's read together Ecclesiastes 1,
[3478.96 → 3481.32] the first 11 verses there.
[3481.32 → 3489.94] The words of the teacher, son of David, king in Jerusalem.
[3491.48 → 3494.66] Meaningless, meaningless, says the teacher.
[3495.70 → 3497.58] Utterly meaningless.
[3498.52 → 3501.20] Everything is meaningless.
[3501.20 → 3508.32] What do people gain from all their labours at which they toil under the sun?
[3509.70 → 3512.78] Generations come and generations go,
[3513.18 → 3516.02] but the earth remains forever.
[3517.24 → 3519.82] The sun rises and the sun sets,
[3520.18 → 3522.50] and it hurries back to where it rises.
[3523.50 → 3526.58] The wind blows to the south and turns to the north.
[3526.58 → 3528.74] Round and round it goes,
[3529.34 → 3531.48] ever returning on its course.
[3533.26 → 3535.64] All streams flow into the sea,
[3535.98 → 3537.50] yet the sea is never full.
[3538.50 → 3540.70] To the place the streams come from,
[3541.32 → 3543.28] there they return again.
[3545.30 → 3547.62] All things are wearisome,
[3547.70 → 3549.30] more than one can say.
[3549.30 → 3552.18] The eye never has enough of seeing,
[3552.38 → 3554.96] or the ear its fill of hearing.
[3555.34 → 3557.46] What has been will be again.
[3558.24 → 3560.98] What has been done will be done again.
[3561.76 → 3564.34] There is nothing new under the sun.
[3565.94 → 3568.26] Is there anything of which one can say,
[3568.42 → 3570.36] look, this is something new.
[3571.04 → 3572.96] It was here already long ago.
[3572.96 → 3575.38] It was here before our time.
[3576.66 → 3579.30] No one remembers the former generations,
[3579.78 → 3582.08] and even those yet to come
[3582.08 → 3585.70] will not be remembered by those who follow them.
[3587.00 → 3588.42] This is the word of the Lord.
[3590.44 → 3593.28] I wondered if that would be a little bit quieter this morning.
[3597.34 → 3600.14] Because it's hard to say thanks be to God after reading that.
[3600.14 → 3602.52] And just a warning,
[3603.52 → 3605.94] the first part of this message
[3605.94 → 3607.66] is going to be depressing.
[3610.74 → 3612.86] But stick with me, please,
[3612.92 → 3613.82] to the second part.
[3616.06 → 3619.40] The first part looks for meaning
[3619.40 → 3622.32] in a meaningless world.
[3623.84 → 3627.20] And I have to admit and share with you,
[3627.34 → 3628.64] hopefully for commiseration,
[3628.64 → 3631.76] in preparation for this message,
[3632.04 → 3633.18] I spent some time
[3633.18 → 3636.00] in the dark corners of Reddit
[3636.00 → 3638.26] this past week,
[3639.66 → 3642.00] looking for conversations on meaning
[3642.00 → 3644.14] and how people find meaning
[3644.14 → 3646.52] and the struggles that they have.
[3646.66 → 3647.90] And may I just say
[3647.90 → 3650.84] that the armchair philosophers of this age
[3650.84 → 3652.36] make me cry.
[3652.36 → 3657.62] Like we live in a particular cultural moment
[3657.62 → 3661.62] where we know that the traditional sort of moorings
[3661.62 → 3663.24] of meaning and purpose,
[3663.36 → 3666.12] those things that we have once grounded ourselves in,
[3666.38 → 3667.46] have kind of faded away,
[3667.62 → 3668.70] or they've been rejected,
[3669.10 → 3670.36] they've been cast off
[3670.36 → 3672.34] in the hopes of something,
[3673.22 → 3674.38] I don't even want to say better,
[3674.80 → 3675.64] but really other.
[3675.64 → 3679.42] in a sense,
[3679.98 → 3683.04] the philosophical structures
[3683.04 → 3687.24] of someone like Friedrich Nietzsche,
[3688.28 → 3692.02] 19th century German philosopher,
[3692.26 → 3693.92] father of nihilism,
[3694.28 → 3696.68] that has finally trickled down
[3696.68 → 3699.38] to become the dominant worldview
[3699.38 → 3701.18] of so many people floundering
[3701.18 → 3702.76] in today's society,
[3703.10 → 3704.62] especially in places like Reddit.
[3704.62 → 3708.76] When we don't inherit a meaning
[3708.76 → 3710.46] or receive a meaning,
[3710.72 → 3712.90] we try to invent meanings
[3712.90 → 3714.96] or we try to say
[3714.96 → 3717.54] that meanings are meaningless,
[3718.18 → 3719.22] that they're unnecessary.
[3720.42 → 3723.16] We try to cast off all-purpose.
[3724.20 → 3727.70] Now, I want to lay this foundation well,
[3727.86 → 3732.00] and so I'm going to read to you
[3732.00 → 3734.48] two quotes from Nietzsche,
[3734.62 → 3737.52] and then I'll balance that out
[3737.52 → 3739.02] with some more modern articulations,
[3739.10 → 3739.30] okay?
[3739.46 → 3741.14] But I think this is helpful for us
[3741.14 → 3743.40] to get the sense of it.
[3744.82 → 3745.22] And so,
[3745.58 → 3746.14] Nietzsche,
[3746.42 → 3748.74] in his famous writing,
[3748.88 → 3749.90] The Will to Power,
[3750.76 → 3751.36] says,
[3751.36 → 3755.30] A nihilist is a man who judges
[3755.30 → 3758.12] of the world as it is
[3758.12 → 3759.86] that it ought not to be,
[3760.94 → 3764.18] and of the world as it ought to be
[3764.18 → 3766.06] that it does not exist.
[3767.96 → 3769.36] According to this view,
[3769.52 → 3770.14] he goes on,
[3770.20 → 3771.14] our existence,
[3771.40 → 3771.74] action,
[3771.90 → 3772.26] suffering,
[3772.42 → 3772.62] willing,
[3772.82 → 3773.16] feeling,
[3773.36 → 3774.66] has no meaning.
[3774.66 → 3776.66] then he says,
[3777.06 → 3778.88] the pathos of in vain
[3778.88 → 3782.28] is the nihilist's pathos.
[3783.68 → 3785.54] Now, he doubles down on this idea
[3785.54 → 3787.48] in The Twilight of Idols,
[3787.68 → 3788.86] which is also called
[3788.86 → 3790.64] of the Antichrist,
[3790.88 → 3792.00] so you can probably anticipate
[3792.00 → 3792.70] where this is going.
[3793.14 → 3793.92] He says,
[3793.92 → 3796.52] No one is accountable
[3796.52 → 3798.06] for existing at all,
[3798.96 → 3800.38] or for being constituted
[3800.38 → 3801.30] as he is,
[3801.48 → 3802.48] or for living
[3802.48 → 3803.50] in the circumstances
[3803.50 → 3804.22] and surroundings
[3804.22 → 3805.20] in which he lives.
[3805.56 → 3807.58] The fatality of his nature
[3807.58 → 3809.24] cannot be disentangled
[3809.24 → 3810.56] from the fatality
[3810.56 → 3812.54] of all that which has been
[3812.54 → 3813.44] and will be.
[3814.66 → 3816.24] He is not the result
[3816.24 → 3817.30] of special design,
[3817.94 → 3818.34] a will,
[3818.76 → 3819.34] a purpose.
[3819.78 → 3820.84] He is not the subject
[3820.84 → 3821.60] of an attempt
[3821.60 → 3823.42] to attain an ideal of man
[3823.42 → 3824.64] or an ideal of happiness
[3824.64 → 3826.40] or an ideal of mortality.
[3826.96 → 3827.98] It is absurd
[3827.98 → 3829.66] to want to hand over
[3829.66 → 3830.22] his nature
[3830.22 → 3831.54] to some purpose or other.
[3832.80 → 3834.70] We invented the concept
[3834.70 → 3835.48] purpose.
[3836.86 → 3837.98] In reality,
[3838.72 → 3839.72] purpose is lacking.
[3844.16 → 3845.52] Now, that would be
[3845.52 → 3849.20] laughable
[3849.20 → 3851.96] were it not so heartbreaking.
[3853.42 → 3855.88] And the reality
[3855.88 → 3857.00] that people
[3857.00 → 3858.36] see life
[3858.36 → 3859.62] and live life
[3859.62 → 3861.04] in this way
[3861.04 → 3862.12] is
[3862.12 → 3864.34] pervasive
[3864.34 → 3868.26] and heartbreaking.
[3870.64 → 3871.48] Now, I said there were
[3871.48 → 3872.34] some modern expressions
[3872.34 → 3872.78] of that.
[3874.54 → 3875.56] In good conscience,
[3875.66 → 3876.76] I cannot recommend
[3876.76 → 3877.36] this show,
[3877.86 → 3878.62] but how many of you
[3878.62 → 3879.16] are familiar with
[3879.16 → 3879.84] Rick and Morty?
[3879.84 → 3881.84] Some of you
[3881.84 → 3882.24] who laughed
[3882.24 → 3882.54] are like,
[3882.60 → 3883.02] yep, I know
[3883.02 → 3883.56] why you can't
[3883.56 → 3884.32] recommend that show.
[3885.22 → 3886.28] Rick and Morty.
[3887.38 → 3887.82] Morty,
[3888.30 → 3889.16] at one point,
[3889.26 → 3889.64] says,
[3890.06 → 3891.02] nobody exists
[3891.02 → 3891.82] on purpose.
[3892.76 → 3893.66] Nobody belongs
[3893.66 → 3894.14] anywhere.
[3895.14 → 3895.58] Everybody's
[3895.58 → 3896.22] going to die.
[3896.76 → 3897.60] Come watch TV.
[3900.90 → 3902.42] In the same way,
[3903.34 → 3903.96] Rust
[3903.96 → 3904.90] Cole,
[3905.50 → 3906.42] who is
[3906.42 → 3906.86] played,
[3906.86 → 3907.48] is a character
[3907.48 → 3908.08] played by
[3908.08 → 3909.10] Matthew McConaughey
[3909.10 → 3909.86] in what I think
[3909.86 → 3910.56] might be his
[3910.56 → 3911.50] the best role ever
[3911.50 → 3913.12] in season one
[3913.12 → 3913.62] of a show
[3913.62 → 3914.78] called The True Detective.
[3916.48 → 3917.46] And he says,
[3918.44 → 3919.38] I think human
[3919.38 → 3920.02] consciousness
[3920.02 → 3921.08] is a tragic
[3921.08 → 3921.70] misstep
[3921.70 → 3922.44] in evolution.
[3925.32 → 3926.12] This is the way
[3926.12 → 3926.50] people are
[3926.50 → 3927.36] functioning and living
[3927.36 → 3928.10] and walking
[3928.10 → 3928.86] and being
[3928.86 → 3930.00] in the world.
[3930.10 → 3931.66] And it doesn't
[3931.66 → 3932.40] actually sound
[3932.40 → 3933.22] all that different
[3933.22 → 3934.84] than the teacher
[3934.84 → 3935.80] in Ecclesiastes.
[3935.80 → 3937.58] Right?
[3937.70 → 3938.30] Meaningless.
[3938.48 → 3939.02] Meaningless.
[3939.14 → 3940.24] Everything is
[3940.24 → 3941.02] meaningless.
[3942.46 → 3943.00] Havel.
[3943.14 → 3943.66] Havel.
[3943.78 → 3944.40] Javelin.
[3944.66 → 3945.78] Hall Havel.
[3946.62 → 3947.20] Vapid.
[3947.76 → 3948.38] Vapid.
[3948.84 → 3949.40] Vapour.
[3949.86 → 3950.54] Everything
[3950.54 → 3951.54] is
[3951.54 → 3952.70] vapidity.
[3954.58 → 3955.08] Enigma.
[3956.02 → 3956.60] Enigma.
[3957.08 → 3957.18] Right?
[3957.24 → 3957.82] Elusive.
[3958.58 → 3959.08] We talked
[3959.08 → 3959.68] last week
[3959.68 → 3960.46] of one of the
[3960.46 → 3961.20] ways of defining
[3961.20 → 3961.70] that is
[3961.70 → 3962.10] just a
[3962.10 → 3964.92] trying to
[3964.92 → 3965.76] grasp onto
[3965.76 → 3966.48] something that
[3966.48 → 3967.00] just blows
[3967.00 → 3967.46] away.
[3968.40 → 3968.84] And then,
[3969.40 → 3970.00] right,
[3971.00 → 3971.78] everything is
[3971.78 → 3972.14] meaningless.
[3972.28 → 3972.72] It's utterly
[3972.72 → 3973.60] meaningless.
[3973.78 → 3974.64] Hall Havel.
[3975.30 → 3975.88] What do
[3975.88 → 3976.80] people gain
[3976.80 → 3977.48] from all
[3977.48 → 3978.26] their labours
[3978.26 → 3978.88] at which
[3978.88 → 3979.64] they toil
[3979.64 → 3981.52] under the sun?
[3983.28 → 3983.86] Now,
[3984.26 → 3984.60] if you have
[3984.60 → 3985.04] a Bible
[3985.04 → 3986.28] and you're
[3986.28 → 3987.12] a person
[3987.12 → 3987.48] who writes
[3987.48 → 3987.98] in your Bibles,
[3988.22 → 3988.76] maybe like
[3988.76 → 3989.52] underline
[3989.52 → 3989.94] that little
[3989.94 → 3990.40] phrase
[3990.40 → 3991.34] under the sun.
[3992.34 → 3992.46] Right?
[3992.52 → 3993.08] Highlight that
[3993.08 → 3993.78] little phrase.
[3994.28 → 3994.92] I'm going to
[3994.92 → 3995.80] return to that
[3995.80 → 3996.20] because it's
[3996.20 → 3996.90] a key concept
[3996.90 → 3997.62] for understanding
[3997.62 → 3998.16] the teacher's
[3998.16 → 3998.82] exploration.
[4000.14 → 4000.30] So,
[4000.40 → 4000.94] park that.
[4001.24 → 4001.70] Hold on to
[4001.70 → 4002.24] that idea.
[4003.34 → 4004.24] But here,
[4004.46 → 4005.08] the teacher
[4005.08 → 4005.82] begins
[4005.82 → 4007.20] what will be
[4007.20 → 4007.80] an argument
[4007.80 → 4008.46] that is going
[4008.46 → 4009.08] to unfold
[4009.08 → 4009.88] over the next
[4009.88 → 4010.44] few verses
[4010.44 → 4011.02] and over the
[4011.02 → 4011.40] next few
[4011.40 → 4011.90] chapters
[4011.90 → 4013.26] showing
[4013.26 → 4014.46] here in
[4014.46 → 4015.12] this text
[4015.12 → 4016.20] how it is
[4016.20 → 4016.72] that the
[4016.72 → 4017.90] earth itself
[4017.90 → 4018.88] remains
[4018.88 → 4019.94] exactly the
[4019.94 → 4020.36] same
[4020.36 → 4021.02] throughout
[4021.02 → 4021.40] all the
[4021.40 → 4021.78] ages.
[4022.64 → 4022.86] Right?
[4022.92 → 4023.52] In verse 4,
[4023.98 → 4024.30] we read
[4024.30 → 4024.82] generations
[4024.82 → 4025.38] come
[4025.38 → 4026.28] and generations
[4026.28 → 4026.82] go
[4026.82 → 4027.52] but the
[4027.52 → 4027.82] earth
[4027.82 → 4028.46] remains
[4028.46 → 4028.94] forever.
[4030.00 → 4030.26] And in
[4030.26 → 4030.64] Hebrew,
[4030.88 → 4031.12] actually,
[4031.20 → 4031.68] the phrasing
[4031.68 → 4032.04] there is
[4032.04 → 4032.54] reversed.
[4033.12 → 4033.40] It says
[4033.40 → 4034.18] goes a
[4034.18 → 4034.70] generation
[4034.70 → 4035.60] and comes
[4035.60 → 4036.32] a generation.
[4037.52 → 4038.60] As if to
[4038.60 → 4039.12] emphasize
[4039.12 → 4039.98] and underscore
[4039.98 → 4041.46] the fleeting
[4041.46 → 4042.80] and replaceable
[4042.80 → 4043.28] rhythms
[4043.28 → 4044.18] of human
[4044.18 → 4044.56] life.
[4044.88 → 4045.68] One generation
[4045.68 → 4046.54] fades away,
[4046.68 → 4047.26] another takes
[4047.26 → 4047.78] its place,
[4047.78 → 4048.06] and the
[4048.06 → 4048.32] cycle
[4048.32 → 4048.94] continues
[4048.94 → 4049.74] on and
[4049.74 → 4050.24] on it
[4050.24 → 4050.58] goes
[4050.58 → 4050.96] without
[4050.96 → 4051.54] pause
[4051.54 → 4052.22] or without
[4052.22 → 4052.82] any real
[4052.82 → 4053.28] semblance
[4053.28 → 4054.14] of permanence
[4054.14 → 4055.10] or purpose.
[4056.14 → 4056.56] This,
[4056.78 → 4057.14] the teacher
[4057.14 → 4057.62] says,
[4057.84 → 4058.46] is why
[4058.46 → 4059.08] the earth
[4059.08 → 4059.72] remains
[4059.72 → 4060.18] forever.
[4061.64 → 4062.42] Because humanity
[4062.42 → 4063.12] comes and
[4063.12 → 4063.66] goes or
[4063.66 → 4064.26] goes and
[4064.26 → 4064.94] comes and
[4064.94 → 4065.28] nothing
[4065.28 → 4066.92] is gained.
[4067.94 → 4068.28] There's no
[4068.28 → 4069.06] lasting mark.
[4069.74 → 4070.16] The earth
[4070.16 → 4070.98] endures,
[4071.40 → 4072.48] unmoved by
[4072.48 → 4073.78] our striving,
[4074.12 → 4074.80] all our
[4074.80 → 4075.58] labours,
[4076.20 → 4076.60] or as
[4076.60 → 4076.84] Nietzsche
[4076.84 → 4077.20] said,
[4077.28 → 4077.94] the fatality
[4077.94 → 4078.60] of his
[4078.60 → 4079.10] nature
[4079.10 → 4079.70] cannot be
[4079.70 → 4080.36] disentangled
[4080.36 → 4080.82] from the
[4080.82 → 4081.40] fatality
[4081.40 → 4082.40] of all
[4082.40 → 4083.26] that which
[4083.26 → 4084.00] has been
[4084.00 → 4084.72] and will
[4084.72 → 4085.28] be.
[4087.10 → 4087.90] And then
[4087.90 → 4088.58] in verse 5,
[4088.66 → 4088.92] the teacher
[4088.92 → 4089.42] looks up.
[4090.70 → 4091.14] The sun
[4091.14 → 4091.94] rises and
[4091.94 → 4092.34] the sun
[4092.34 → 4092.82] sets,
[4093.18 → 4093.38] and it
[4093.38 → 4094.16] hurries back
[4094.16 → 4094.74] to where
[4094.74 → 4095.22] it rises.
[4096.52 → 4096.78] Again,
[4096.92 → 4097.54] the word
[4097.54 → 4098.28] in Hebrew
[4098.28 → 4098.74] there that
[4098.74 → 4099.32] is translated
[4099.32 → 4099.82] hurries
[4099.82 → 4100.98] literally means
[4100.98 → 4101.70] pants,
[4102.12 → 4102.48] like an
[4102.48 → 4103.00] exhausted
[4103.00 → 4103.38] runner,
[4104.74 → 4105.40] struggling
[4105.40 → 4105.92] to keep
[4105.92 → 4106.36] pace,
[4106.84 → 4107.64] and it's
[4107.64 → 4108.26] an image
[4108.26 → 4108.82] of this
[4108.82 → 4110.16] drudging
[4110.16 → 4111.74] repetition.
[4112.86 → 4113.42] The sun
[4113.42 → 4114.36] strains to
[4114.36 → 4115.06] complete its
[4115.06 → 4115.42] circuit,
[4115.66 → 4116.28] only to
[4116.28 → 4117.12] strain again
[4117.12 → 4117.86] doing it
[4117.86 → 4118.28] all over.
[4118.90 → 4119.36] There's no
[4119.36 → 4119.84] advancement,
[4120.18 → 4120.58] there's no
[4120.58 → 4121.04] profit,
[4121.32 → 4121.78] there's no
[4121.78 → 4122.98] true progress.
[4123.10 → 4123.56] The sun
[4123.56 → 4124.52] gains nothing
[4124.52 → 4125.28] from all
[4125.28 → 4125.70] of its
[4125.70 → 4126.56] labours.
[4127.76 → 4127.96] And then
[4127.96 → 4128.54] in verse 6,
[4128.66 → 4128.98] we keep
[4128.98 → 4130.12] digging deep
[4130.12 → 4130.78] into this
[4130.78 → 4131.12] pit.
[4131.28 → 4131.60] The teacher
[4131.60 → 4132.20] turns to
[4132.20 → 4132.66] the wind.
[4132.66 → 4133.76] The wind
[4133.76 → 4134.34] blows to
[4134.34 → 4134.84] the south,
[4134.96 → 4135.40] it turns
[4135.40 → 4136.06] to the north,
[4136.16 → 4136.62] round and
[4136.62 → 4137.04] round it
[4137.04 → 4137.34] goes,
[4137.44 → 4138.16] ever returning
[4138.16 → 4139.06] on its
[4139.06 → 4139.68] course.
[4141.00 → 4141.52] To our
[4141.52 → 4141.98] eyes,
[4142.78 → 4143.44] the wind
[4143.44 → 4144.70] seems free
[4144.70 → 4145.86] and unpredictable,
[4146.42 → 4147.32] blowing wherever
[4147.32 → 4148.34] it pleases,
[4148.64 → 4149.08] and yet,
[4149.20 → 4149.68] what the teacher
[4149.68 → 4150.22] is saying,
[4150.52 → 4151.30] it too is
[4151.30 → 4151.94] trapped in
[4151.94 → 4152.66] this endless
[4152.66 → 4153.58] repetition.
[4154.12 → 4154.56] The wind
[4154.56 → 4155.48] too gains
[4155.48 → 4156.76] nothing from
[4156.76 → 4157.34] all its
[4157.34 → 4158.32] moving about.
[4158.32 → 4160.94] and then
[4160.94 → 4161.42] dig even
[4161.42 → 4161.76] deeper.
[4161.92 → 4162.40] Verse 7,
[4162.50 → 4162.88] he points
[4162.88 → 4163.20] to the
[4163.20 → 4163.60] waters.
[4164.68 → 4165.48] All streams
[4165.48 → 4166.28] flow into
[4166.28 → 4166.78] the sea,
[4166.92 → 4167.26] yet the
[4167.26 → 4167.98] sea is
[4167.98 → 4168.66] never
[4168.66 → 4169.52] full.
[4170.92 → 4171.32] Despite
[4171.32 → 4172.20] this constant
[4172.20 → 4172.88] motion,
[4173.42 → 4173.92] the rivers
[4173.92 → 4174.92] never achieve
[4174.92 → 4175.62] their purpose,
[4175.80 → 4176.50] the sea is
[4176.50 → 4177.74] never satisfied,
[4177.96 → 4178.52] all of that
[4178.52 → 4178.96] activity,
[4179.18 → 4179.68] all of that
[4179.68 → 4180.28] energy,
[4180.48 → 4181.06] all of that
[4181.06 → 4181.52] movement,
[4182.38 → 4183.28] no result.
[4185.82 → 4186.42] Sidney
[4186.42 → 4187.54] Adonis is
[4187.54 → 4189.44] a now
[4189.44 → 4190.12] retired
[4190.12 → 4190.96] professor
[4190.96 → 4191.96] from Calvin
[4191.96 → 4192.50] Seminary,
[4193.40 → 4194.16] and has
[4194.16 → 4194.64] written
[4194.64 → 4196.04] a beautiful
[4196.04 → 4196.54] book on
[4196.54 → 4196.86] preaching
[4196.86 → 4197.46] Christ from
[4197.46 → 4198.22] Ecclesiastes,
[4198.44 → 4198.92] and in that
[4198.92 → 4199.36] book he
[4199.36 → 4200.18] says that
[4200.18 → 4201.72] all this
[4201.72 → 4202.36] activity
[4202.36 → 4203.46] shows no
[4203.46 → 4204.18] results.
[4205.02 → 4205.34] There is
[4205.34 → 4205.92] no gain.
[4207.28 → 4207.78] The teacher
[4207.78 → 4208.60] has surveyed
[4208.60 → 4209.10] the natural
[4209.10 → 4209.74] world and
[4209.74 → 4210.38] he finds
[4210.38 → 4211.02] in it a
[4211.02 → 4211.62] picture of
[4211.62 → 4212.40] futility,
[4213.62 → 4214.16] creation
[4214.16 → 4214.80] itself,
[4215.08 → 4215.86] mirroring
[4215.86 → 4216.98] humanity's
[4216.98 → 4217.52] restless
[4217.52 → 4218.52] striving,
[4219.22 → 4219.98] unceasing,
[4220.82 → 4221.46] exhausting,
[4222.52 → 4223.16] fruitless.
[4225.34 → 4226.08] And the
[4226.08 → 4226.76] teacher then
[4226.76 → 4228.30] turns his
[4228.30 → 4229.50] gaze from
[4229.50 → 4231.46] nature to
[4231.46 → 4231.96] humanity,
[4232.48 → 4233.10] and his
[4233.10 → 4233.68] conclusion is
[4233.68 → 4234.06] the same.
[4234.94 → 4235.58] There is no
[4235.58 → 4235.92] gain.
[4237.42 → 4238.06] Verse 9,
[4238.16 → 4238.60] what has
[4238.60 → 4239.14] been will
[4239.14 → 4239.72] be again,
[4239.86 → 4240.12] what has
[4240.12 → 4240.62] been done
[4240.62 → 4240.92] will be
[4240.92 → 4241.54] done again.
[4241.70 → 4242.08] There is
[4242.08 → 4243.28] nothing new
[4243.28 → 4243.94] under the
[4243.94 → 4244.20] sun.
[4244.30 → 4244.70] The human
[4244.70 → 4245.46] story is
[4245.46 → 4245.98] caught in
[4245.98 → 4246.56] the same
[4246.56 → 4247.24] weary
[4247.24 → 4247.92] repetition.
[4248.42 → 4248.96] We talk
[4248.96 → 4249.62] endlessly,
[4249.96 → 4250.50] we seek
[4250.50 → 4251.32] endlessly,
[4251.60 → 4252.52] we consume
[4252.52 → 4253.40] endlessly,
[4253.66 → 4254.32] we're desperate
[4254.32 → 4255.48] to see and
[4255.48 → 4256.16] to hear and
[4256.16 → 4256.74] to know,
[4256.92 → 4257.76] to be seen
[4257.76 → 4258.36] and to be
[4258.36 → 4258.86] heard and
[4258.86 → 4259.58] to be known,
[4259.68 → 4260.70] to experience
[4260.70 → 4261.42] it all.
[4261.76 → 4262.24] We chase
[4262.24 → 4263.66] after novelty
[4263.66 → 4264.60] and we call it
[4264.60 → 4265.26] progress,
[4265.50 → 4266.40] but the teacher
[4266.40 → 4267.40] says there's
[4267.40 → 4268.16] nothing new
[4268.16 → 4269.42] under the
[4269.42 → 4269.64] sun.
[4270.28 → 4270.90] All our
[4270.90 → 4271.68] striving is
[4271.68 → 4272.28] this same
[4272.28 → 4273.46] old story.
[4275.18 → 4276.44] We live
[4276.44 → 4278.02] in this
[4278.02 → 4278.64] sort of
[4278.64 → 4279.86] experiential
[4279.86 → 4280.92] cultural
[4280.92 → 4281.86] moment
[4281.86 → 4283.78] where we've
[4283.78 → 4284.46] built an
[4284.46 → 4285.34] entire way
[4285.34 → 4285.98] of being
[4285.98 → 4286.36] in the
[4286.36 → 4286.82] world and
[4286.82 → 4287.36] of seeing
[4287.36 → 4288.04] the world
[4288.04 → 4289.22] around the
[4289.22 → 4289.88] idea of
[4289.88 → 4290.34] gain,
[4290.88 → 4291.38] around the
[4291.38 → 4292.08] belief that
[4292.08 → 4292.88] meaning and
[4292.88 → 4293.56] satisfaction
[4293.56 → 4294.40] can be
[4294.40 → 4294.94] found if
[4294.94 → 4295.32] we just
[4295.32 → 4296.12] achieve the
[4296.12 → 4296.66] right thing,
[4296.76 → 4297.12] if we just
[4297.12 → 4298.42] experience the
[4298.42 → 4299.02] right thing,
[4299.10 → 4299.50] if we just
[4299.50 → 4300.42] go to the
[4300.42 → 4301.16] right place
[4301.16 → 4302.32] or see the
[4302.32 → 4303.04] right people,
[4303.28 → 4303.76] we think if
[4303.76 → 4304.34] I could just
[4304.34 → 4304.86] make this
[4304.86 → 4305.90] team or if
[4305.90 → 4306.32] I could just
[4306.32 → 4306.80] get this
[4306.80 → 4307.30] job,
[4307.60 → 4307.90] if I could
[4307.90 → 4308.38] just have
[4308.38 → 4309.16] that house
[4309.16 → 4309.88] or that
[4309.88 → 4310.52] boat or
[4310.52 → 4311.36] that vacation
[4311.36 → 4312.02] or that
[4312.02 → 4313.10] video game,
[4313.40 → 4313.98] honestly it
[4313.98 → 4314.56] doesn't matter,
[4314.66 → 4315.12] it's always
[4315.12 → 4316.14] just something.
[4317.48 → 4317.92] Then,
[4318.38 → 4320.28] then I
[4320.28 → 4320.96] can rest.
[4321.60 → 4322.22] Then I
[4322.22 → 4322.60] can have
[4322.60 → 4323.02] peace.
[4323.46 → 4323.96] Then I
[4323.96 → 4324.44] can feel
[4324.44 → 4325.16] like I've
[4325.16 → 4325.54] made it.
[4325.66 → 4326.18] Then I
[4326.18 → 4326.60] can have
[4326.60 → 4327.36] purpose.
[4330.42 → 4331.56] But the
[4331.56 → 4332.14] teacher stands
[4332.14 → 4332.38] in the
[4332.38 → 4332.76] middle of
[4332.76 → 4333.14] all that
[4333.14 → 4336.44] striving and
[4336.44 → 4336.92] he whispers
[4336.92 → 4337.70] the question
[4337.70 → 4339.26] that we
[4339.26 → 4339.84] try not to
[4339.84 → 4340.54] ask ourselves.
[4342.50 → 4343.22] What have
[4343.22 → 4343.56] we really
[4343.56 → 4345.50] gained in
[4345.50 → 4345.94] all of that
[4345.94 → 4346.32] striving?
[4347.68 → 4348.46] What have I
[4348.46 → 4349.30] really accomplished
[4349.30 → 4350.28] in all of
[4350.28 → 4350.86] that purposing?
[4350.86 → 4350.96] you?
[4354.00 → 4354.58] When I
[4354.58 → 4354.86] was a
[4354.86 → 4355.74] kid, I
[4355.74 → 4357.12] read a
[4357.12 → 4358.12] book in
[4358.12 → 4358.76] high school
[4358.76 → 4360.70] by Mordecai
[4360.70 → 4361.20] Richer,
[4361.34 → 4361.76] Canadian
[4361.76 → 4362.70] author.
[4363.06 → 4363.36] The book
[4363.36 → 4363.66] is called
[4363.66 → 4364.58] The Apprenticeship
[4364.58 → 4365.04] of Buddy
[4365.04 → 4365.58] Gravity.
[4366.38 → 4366.84] If you're
[4366.84 → 4367.40] my age,
[4367.48 → 4367.84] you maybe
[4367.84 → 4368.32] read it.
[4368.38 → 4368.64] I don't
[4368.64 → 4368.98] think they
[4368.98 → 4369.36] read that
[4369.36 → 4369.70] book in
[4369.70 → 4370.34] schools anymore.
[4371.00 → 4371.70] Not sure
[4371.70 → 4372.18] why, but
[4372.18 → 4373.34] this book
[4373.34 → 4375.20] painted this
[4375.20 → 4376.34] vivid picture
[4376.34 → 4377.00] of the
[4377.00 → 4377.86] futility of
[4377.86 → 4378.66] this pursuit
[4378.66 → 4379.20] for me
[4379.20 → 4379.98] that has
[4379.98 → 4380.42] been with
[4380.42 → 4380.76] me ever
[4380.76 → 4381.08] since.
[4382.02 → 4382.64] The young
[4382.64 → 4383.80] Buddy grows
[4383.80 → 4384.38] up in
[4384.38 → 4384.98] Montreal,
[4385.38 → 4385.86] and early
[4385.86 → 4386.22] in his
[4386.22 → 4386.90] life, he's
[4386.90 → 4388.82] told that
[4388.82 → 4389.38] a man
[4389.38 → 4390.36] without land
[4390.36 → 4391.16] is no
[4391.16 → 4391.52] one.
[4393.02 → 4393.46] And those
[4393.46 → 4394.38] words take
[4394.38 → 4395.54] root in the
[4395.54 → 4396.06] core of his
[4396.06 → 4396.74] being, and
[4396.74 → 4397.34] they drive
[4397.34 → 4398.44] everything he
[4398.44 → 4398.84] does.
[4399.46 → 4399.78] And from
[4399.78 → 4400.20] that moment
[4400.20 → 4400.80] on, he
[4400.80 → 4401.92] becomes obsessed
[4401.92 → 4402.92] with acquiring
[4402.92 → 4404.90] land, convinced
[4404.90 → 4405.72] that owning
[4405.72 → 4406.70] property will
[4406.70 → 4407.30] give him
[4407.30 → 4408.80] identity and
[4408.80 → 4409.70] worth and
[4409.70 → 4410.06] meaning.
[4410.42 → 4411.64] along the
[4411.64 → 4412.24] way, he
[4412.24 → 4412.74] meets a
[4412.74 → 4413.40] woman named
[4413.40 → 4413.76] Yvette
[4413.76 → 4415.42] Durrell, one
[4415.42 → 4415.94] of the few
[4415.94 → 4416.54] people in
[4416.54 → 4417.18] that story
[4417.18 → 4417.60] that it
[4417.60 → 4418.30] seems that
[4418.30 → 4418.90] he shares
[4418.90 → 4419.58] a genuine
[4419.58 → 4420.18] relationship
[4420.18 → 4420.56] with.
[4421.78 → 4422.46] But as
[4422.46 → 4423.10] his ambition
[4423.10 → 4424.04] grows throughout
[4424.04 → 4424.70] the story,
[4425.52 → 4425.84] and Buddy
[4425.84 → 4426.90] begins to
[4426.90 → 4427.60] use people
[4427.60 → 4427.88] and to
[4427.88 → 4428.50] take advantage
[4428.50 → 4428.88] of them
[4428.88 → 4429.22] and to
[4429.22 → 4429.98] deceive
[4429.98 → 4430.58] them, and
[4430.58 → 4431.62] even stealing
[4431.62 → 4432.20] from his
[4432.20 → 4432.86] uncle, who
[4432.86 → 4433.76] is another
[4433.76 → 4434.22] one of the
[4434.22 → 4434.74] people who
[4434.74 → 4435.70] have provided
[4435.70 → 4436.26] for him and
[4436.26 → 4436.70] been with
[4436.70 → 4437.66] him, just
[4437.66 → 4438.20] so he can
[4438.20 → 4438.60] get this
[4438.60 → 4438.98] goal.
[4440.60 → 4440.96] And in
[4440.96 → 4443.12] the end, the
[4443.12 → 4444.26] last scenes of
[4444.26 → 4445.26] the book, he
[4445.26 → 4447.60] has his land, and
[4447.60 → 4448.40] it's beautiful and
[4448.40 → 4448.92] sprawling.
[4449.02 → 4449.36] He gets
[4449.36 → 4450.46] everything he
[4450.46 → 4452.50] wanted, but at a
[4452.50 → 4453.22] terrible cost.
[4454.20 → 4455.92] He loses Yvette,
[4456.70 → 4457.66] he alienates all
[4457.66 → 4458.66] his friends and
[4458.66 → 4459.84] his family, and
[4459.84 → 4461.40] he stands alone
[4461.40 → 4463.06] on the property
[4463.06 → 4464.26] that was supposed
[4464.26 → 4464.94] to make him
[4464.94 → 4465.40] someone.
[4467.68 → 4468.36] So the
[4468.36 → 4469.88] question can
[4469.88 → 4470.36] be asked,
[4470.52 → 4470.66] right?
[4470.76 → 4471.78] Buddy Gravity
[4471.78 → 4472.66] begs the same
[4472.66 → 4473.14] question.
[4473.46 → 4473.88] What does a
[4473.88 → 4474.62] man gain from
[4474.62 → 4475.40] all his labour
[4475.40 → 4476.00] at which he
[4476.00 → 4476.58] toils under
[4476.58 → 4477.02] the sun?
[4477.98 → 4478.24] And the
[4478.24 → 4479.08] answer is that
[4479.08 → 4479.70] he gains
[4479.70 → 4480.04] nothing.
[4480.16 → 4480.66] Buddy gained
[4480.66 → 4481.28] nothing.
[4481.62 → 4482.12] All of his
[4482.12 → 4482.88] striving left
[4482.88 → 4483.52] him empty
[4483.52 → 4484.58] and alone.
[4484.70 → 4485.10] All of his
[4485.10 → 4485.80] work and his
[4485.80 → 4486.44] ambition and
[4486.44 → 4486.92] his endless
[4486.92 → 4487.62] pursuit of
[4487.62 → 4488.66] profit, all
[4488.66 → 4489.20] of it was
[4489.20 → 4489.70] vanity.
[4490.24 → 4490.80] All of it
[4490.80 → 4493.16] was because
[4493.16 → 4493.80] it disappeared.
[4494.26 → 4494.94] the moment
[4494.94 → 4495.44] he had it.
[4498.70 → 4499.34] Now let's
[4499.34 → 4501.08] go back to
[4501.08 → 4501.54] that first
[4501.54 → 4502.10] question.
[4503.46 → 4503.80] What do
[4503.80 → 4504.52] people gain
[4504.52 → 4505.54] from all of
[4505.54 → 4506.66] their labour,
[4507.02 → 4507.76] all of their
[4507.76 → 4509.10] toil, at
[4509.10 → 4509.68] which they
[4509.68 → 4510.94] toil, under
[4510.94 → 4512.34] the sun?
[4513.56 → 4514.24] Now that
[4514.24 → 4515.20] phrase, under
[4515.20 → 4516.76] the sun, is
[4516.76 → 4517.54] crucial.
[4517.80 → 4518.28] It is a
[4518.28 → 4519.84] major qualifier
[4519.84 → 4521.00] for the
[4521.00 → 4521.56] teacher in
[4521.56 → 4521.98] the book of
[4521.98 → 4522.68] Ecclesiastes.
[4523.04 → 4523.76] The teacher
[4523.76 → 4525.14] is deliberately
[4525.14 → 4526.84] describing human
[4526.84 → 4528.44] life viewed
[4528.44 → 4530.12] apart from
[4530.12 → 4530.88] God.
[4532.12 → 4533.14] The teacher
[4533.14 → 4534.00] is setting up
[4534.00 → 4534.64] his argument
[4534.64 → 4535.52] from what we
[4535.52 → 4536.04] would today
[4536.04 → 4536.98] call a secular
[4536.98 → 4537.60] perspective.
[4538.40 → 4539.42] He's looking at
[4539.42 → 4540.18] the world from
[4540.18 → 4541.32] the ground up,
[4541.32 → 4542.24] from human
[4542.24 → 4543.16] experience and
[4543.16 → 4543.70] observation,
[4543.70 → 4545.30] without the lens
[4545.30 → 4546.12] of divine
[4546.12 → 4546.78] revelation.
[4547.24 → 4547.54] And his
[4547.54 → 4548.84] conclusion in
[4548.84 → 4549.96] that frame is
[4549.96 → 4550.40] that it's all
[4550.40 → 4550.72] meaningless.
[4551.92 → 4552.74] And it
[4552.74 → 4553.82] stands as a
[4553.82 → 4554.54] warning for
[4554.54 → 4555.86] Israel and
[4555.86 → 4556.56] for us,
[4556.86 → 4557.48] that apart
[4557.48 → 4558.24] from God,
[4558.40 → 4559.12] we will not
[4559.12 → 4559.94] gain anything
[4559.94 → 4560.88] from all of
[4560.88 → 4561.36] our toil.
[4561.70 → 4562.84] Life lived
[4562.84 → 4563.68] under the
[4563.68 → 4565.12] sun is a
[4565.12 → 4566.34] life without
[4566.34 → 4567.32] reference to
[4567.32 → 4567.92] the creator.
[4568.34 → 4568.82] And when you
[4568.82 → 4569.86] leave God out
[4569.86 → 4570.60] of the picture,
[4571.00 → 4571.96] everything else
[4571.96 → 4572.74] loses its
[4572.74 → 4573.04] meaning.
[4573.04 → 4578.42] Now, let's
[4578.42 → 4578.94] dig into the
[4578.94 → 4580.66] context and
[4580.66 → 4581.14] set up the
[4581.14 → 4581.70] kind of cultural
[4581.70 → 4582.56] moment just so
[4582.56 → 4583.62] we can see just
[4583.62 → 4584.24] how profound
[4584.24 → 4584.76] this is.
[4584.84 → 4585.34] Verse 1
[4585.34 → 4586.60] started by
[4586.60 → 4586.88] saying,
[4587.02 → 4587.66] the words of
[4587.66 → 4588.20] the teacher,
[4588.36 → 4589.30] son of David,
[4589.52 → 4590.62] king in
[4590.62 → 4591.18] Jerusalem.
[4592.84 → 4593.18] Now, what's
[4593.18 → 4593.78] up with this?
[4595.48 → 4596.38] For a long
[4596.38 → 4597.38] time, and we
[4597.38 → 4598.22] already heard it
[4598.22 → 4599.32] here this
[4599.32 → 4600.46] morning, people
[4600.46 → 4601.36] thought that
[4601.36 → 4602.12] Ecclesiastes
[4602.12 → 4603.14] was written by
[4603.14 → 4603.58] Solomon.
[4604.92 → 4605.72] Because when we
[4605.72 → 4606.94] think of wise
[4606.94 → 4608.06] people in the
[4608.06 → 4608.78] Bible, we think
[4608.78 → 4609.28] of Solomon,
[4609.72 → 4610.68] who asked God
[4610.68 → 4611.40] for wisdom, who
[4611.40 → 4611.88] wrote the book
[4611.88 → 4612.96] of Proverbs, and
[4612.96 → 4613.72] this seems to be
[4613.72 → 4614.94] an extension of
[4614.94 → 4615.74] that kind of
[4615.74 → 4616.40] writing.
[4617.16 → 4617.68] And for sure,
[4617.86 → 4618.36] this opening
[4618.36 → 4620.10] line, the son
[4620.10 → 4621.02] of David, king
[4621.02 → 4621.90] in Jerusalem,
[4622.48 → 4623.62] lends itself
[4623.62 → 4624.64] naturally to that
[4624.64 → 4625.28] understanding.
[4627.18 → 4628.04] And I think on
[4628.04 → 4628.48] purpose.
[4629.64 → 4630.06] And like I said,
[4630.10 → 4631.06] for a long time,
[4631.20 → 4631.68] this was the
[4631.68 → 4632.46] dominant assumption
[4632.46 → 4634.18] that Solomon was
[4634.18 → 4635.10] writing this.
[4635.44 → 4636.90] Although, already
[4636.90 → 4637.78] in the time of
[4637.78 → 4639.16] Martin Luther, in
[4639.16 → 4640.08] the 16th century,
[4640.22 → 4640.86] there began to be
[4640.86 → 4642.02] challenges to this
[4642.02 → 4642.46] assumption.
[4643.54 → 4644.46] Luther argues that
[4644.46 → 4645.30] it was composed by
[4645.30 → 4646.24] Sirach around the
[4646.24 → 4646.64] time of the
[4646.64 → 4647.52] Maccabees, which is
[4647.52 → 4648.68] like 180 BC.
[4650.06 → 4651.66] In the 17th century,
[4651.80 → 4652.78] there's a Dutch
[4652.78 → 4653.70] scholar named
[4653.70 → 4654.72] Hugo Grotius.
[4655.12 → 4656.22] He's the first to
[4656.22 → 4658.00] make a case for a
[4658.00 → 4659.24] later authorship based
[4659.24 → 4660.02] on the Hebrew
[4660.02 → 4661.44] structure of the
[4661.44 → 4662.36] book of Ecclesiastes.
[4662.80 → 4663.72] We'll get into this
[4663.72 → 4664.76] in the podcast, so
[4664.76 → 4665.22] we don't have to
[4665.22 → 4666.06] waste our time here
[4666.06 → 4666.46] for that.
[4667.52 → 4668.90] Point being, it
[4668.90 → 4670.50] seems more likely
[4670.50 → 4672.24] that Ecclesiastes is
[4672.24 → 4673.84] written sometime in
[4673.84 → 4675.22] the late 3rd century,
[4675.72 → 4678.04] around 230 BC or so,
[4678.38 → 4680.40] but certainly between
[4680.40 → 4681.56] the 3rd and the 5th
[4681.56 → 4682.02] century.
[4683.12 → 4684.12] Now, clearly, the
[4684.12 → 4685.90] intent is to make the
[4685.90 → 4686.88] reader think of
[4686.88 → 4688.76] Solomon, right, and
[4688.76 → 4690.10] to identify the
[4690.10 → 4691.32] teacher with that
[4691.32 → 4692.40] kind of person,
[4692.70 → 4693.48] someone whose known
[4693.48 → 4694.82] for wisdom and for
[4694.82 → 4695.26] wealth.
[4696.22 → 4697.00] And chapter 12,
[4697.10 → 4697.72] where we started
[4697.72 → 4699.20] last time, right,
[4699.38 → 4701.28] also reads in a way
[4701.28 → 4703.26] that seems to make
[4703.26 → 4704.20] the conclusion that
[4704.20 → 4705.72] this person was a
[4705.72 → 4707.20] historical person,
[4707.26 → 4708.20] that he was a real
[4708.20 → 4709.98] teacher and not a
[4709.98 → 4711.10] literary construct,
[4711.22 → 4712.28] not a plot device
[4712.28 → 4712.96] used to make a
[4712.96 → 4713.26] point.
[4713.26 → 4714.60] And so I think,
[4715.38 → 4716.70] with many others,
[4716.84 → 4717.90] that the point is to
[4717.90 → 4719.64] understand that the
[4719.64 → 4722.02] teacher is a person
[4722.02 → 4723.96] of capability and
[4723.96 → 4725.86] status and means,
[4726.24 → 4727.74] and one who goes on
[4727.74 → 4729.04] an intellectual journey
[4729.04 → 4730.52] of discovery and
[4730.52 → 4732.28] investigation, and who
[4732.28 → 4733.68] has the means to do
[4733.68 → 4734.04] so.
[4735.82 → 4737.92] In short, in an age of
[4737.92 → 4739.54] competing voices and of
[4739.54 → 4740.96] attention vacuums and
[4740.96 → 4743.02] time sinks, here is a
[4743.02 → 4743.94] teacher worth listening
[4743.94 → 4744.22] to.
[4746.40 → 4747.62] Now, at the same time
[4747.62 → 4749.46] as this, the Greek
[4749.46 → 4750.90] empire is expanding,
[4751.52 → 4752.86] and it expands to
[4752.86 → 4754.98] include the region of
[4754.98 → 4756.52] Israel and Judea.
[4757.28 → 4759.40] And with that comes now
[4759.40 → 4761.56] global opportunities for
[4761.56 → 4763.26] trade and commerce.
[4764.18 → 4765.52] With that, right into
[4765.52 → 4767.98] this region moves
[4767.98 → 4769.94] cultures and customs
[4769.94 → 4771.96] from across the world.
[4773.26 → 4774.56] Israel is at a
[4774.56 → 4777.20] crossroads, both in
[4777.20 → 4779.28] geography and in its
[4779.28 → 4780.60] intellectual history.
[4781.02 → 4781.14] Right?
[4781.16 → 4782.62] In geography and
[4782.62 → 4783.74] history, they're no
[4783.74 → 4785.14] longer an agrarian
[4785.14 → 4786.76] society, but they are
[4786.76 → 4788.00] the gateway between
[4788.00 → 4789.70] Africa and Asia,
[4789.84 → 4790.56] between the Middle
[4790.56 → 4791.90] East and the Greek
[4791.90 → 4792.38] empire.
[4793.38 → 4795.44] And all of these ideas
[4795.44 → 4796.86] and people are moving
[4796.86 → 4798.82] through this time and
[4798.82 → 4799.74] this place.
[4800.80 → 4802.32] And this is a huge
[4802.32 → 4804.18] opportunity for
[4804.18 → 4805.84] economic and cultural
[4805.84 → 4806.88] and religious
[4806.88 → 4807.62] diversity.
[4809.02 → 4810.56] And so the people
[4810.56 → 4811.70] have a choice to
[4811.70 → 4811.98] make.
[4813.90 → 4815.98] And the teacher of
[4815.98 → 4817.76] Ecclesiastes is
[4817.76 → 4819.22] pointing out what that
[4819.22 → 4821.08] choice might look like.
[4821.08 → 4824.22] in an age of competing
[4824.22 → 4826.82] visions for life, in an
[4826.82 → 4827.52] age when there's all
[4827.52 → 4829.38] sorts of distractions to
[4829.38 → 4830.66] numb the meaninglessness
[4830.66 → 4833.44] of it all, here, he
[4833.44 → 4834.92] says, is a message worth
[4834.92 → 4835.64] knowing.
[4836.60 → 4837.56] The teacher is
[4837.56 → 4838.76] intentionally setting up a
[4838.76 → 4840.56] contrast and is asking,
[4840.90 → 4841.80] what's more compelling?
[4841.80 → 4846.02] And I hope you can see it,
[4847.26 → 4849.42] but we live in a moment of
[4849.42 → 4850.48] precisely the same
[4850.48 → 4852.92] contrasts, precisely the
[4852.92 → 4854.00] same questions.
[4854.40 → 4856.28] There are more voices now
[4856.28 → 4857.54] competing for our
[4857.54 → 4859.00] attention than ever
[4859.00 → 4859.42] before.
[4860.14 → 4862.12] There are more ideas about
[4862.12 → 4863.64] what is good and about what
[4863.64 → 4865.10] is evil than there has
[4865.10 → 4866.52] ever been, and they're
[4866.52 → 4867.80] being sourced from all
[4867.80 → 4868.50] over the world.
[4868.50 → 4870.44] There are currently more
[4870.44 → 4872.88] distractions to numb us
[4872.88 → 4874.88] from the impact of what
[4874.88 → 4876.38] we are now calling choice
[4876.38 → 4877.84] fatigue and executive
[4877.84 → 4878.38] dysfunction.
[4881.26 → 4882.44] What will you choose?
[4884.36 → 4885.48] Or maybe you'll choose not
[4885.48 → 4885.90] to choose.
[4886.90 → 4888.26] How will you see the world?
[4889.42 → 4890.24] Or maybe you'll choose to
[4890.24 → 4891.04] bury your head in the sand.
[4891.96 → 4893.02] Who will you listen to?
[4893.68 → 4894.52] Or maybe you'll listen to
[4894.52 → 4895.40] everyone and not make a
[4895.40 → 4896.14] decision for yourself.
[4896.14 → 4900.16] The teacher in this book
[4900.16 → 4901.68] pulls no punches.
[4902.10 → 4903.92] The Word of God pulls no
[4903.92 → 4904.58] punches.
[4905.10 → 4905.54] It says,
[4906.08 → 4907.32] Life under the sun is
[4907.32 → 4909.08] fleeting and elusive and
[4909.08 → 4910.48] repetitive like chasing
[4910.48 → 4913.22] vapour if you try it without
[4913.22 → 4913.66] God.
[4914.94 → 4916.08] That's the big idea.
[4916.72 → 4918.26] Life without God is
[4918.26 → 4920.48] fleeting, elusive and
[4920.48 → 4922.42] repetitive like chasing
[4922.42 → 4923.62] after a vapour.
[4923.72 → 4924.88] Like I said, there's no
[4924.88 → 4925.62] punches pulled.
[4926.14 → 4928.62] It is really only God who
[4928.62 → 4930.12] makes meaning out of the
[4930.12 → 4931.54] moments of our life because
[4931.54 → 4932.76] God gives life.
[4933.98 → 4936.10] And so, of course it is
[4936.10 → 4937.74] that life without God is
[4937.74 → 4939.10] ultimately a life without
[4939.10 → 4939.60] meaning.
[4942.60 → 4943.24] Now,
[4943.24 → 4953.82] I know that someone will want to
[4953.82 → 4954.78] challenge this idea.
[4956.92 → 4958.00] And honestly, good.
[4958.72 → 4959.38] You should.
[4960.52 → 4962.28] You should challenge this idea.
[4963.88 → 4966.28] Ecclesiastes is an exercise of
[4966.28 → 4969.22] challenging ideas, of testing their
[4969.22 → 4971.50] veracity, of seeing if it fits.
[4971.50 → 4972.60] And we can continue that
[4972.60 → 4972.98] practice.
[4973.10 → 4974.54] And we can be a space and a
[4974.54 → 4975.88] community where those kinds of
[4975.88 → 4977.32] hard questions are welcomed.
[4978.86 → 4981.32] And in truth, right, in reality,
[4981.88 → 4985.28] few of us live like Morty said was
[4985.28 → 4985.58] true.
[4986.86 → 4987.06] Right?
[4987.12 → 4989.90] Few of us live or love like
[4989.90 → 4991.46] Nietzsche was right.
[4991.46 → 4991.82] Right?
[4991.82 → 4995.70] Most people go about life making
[4995.70 → 4997.38] meaning of the things that we do
[4997.38 → 4998.44] and the life that we live.
[4998.78 → 5001.66] We are meaning-making beings.
[5002.14 → 5003.46] And in our brains and in our
[5003.46 → 5005.28] hearts, we make things have
[5005.28 → 5007.16] meaning so that we can feel like
[5007.16 → 5008.00] they're worth doing.
[5008.00 → 5013.14] The question that remains is, do
[5013.14 → 5016.32] those meanings rise to the level of
[5016.32 → 5019.24] universal or, more categorically, does
[5019.24 → 5023.34] any meaning rise to the level of being
[5023.34 → 5024.84] common to all?
[5026.74 → 5028.94] That's where we need to press.
[5031.16 → 5032.44] Let me illustrate this.
[5032.44 → 5035.08] Think about a chair.
[5035.50 → 5035.64] Right?
[5035.68 → 5036.64] A chair like this.
[5037.26 → 5037.42] Right?
[5037.76 → 5038.94] Here are chairs.
[5039.06 → 5040.40] If you look in the foyer, there are
[5040.40 → 5042.56] people sitting in other chairs out
[5042.56 → 5042.90] there.
[5043.34 → 5045.44] If you go into my study around the
[5045.44 → 5047.54] corner, there's another chair over
[5047.54 → 5047.94] there.
[5048.04 → 5050.00] But we can look at all three of those
[5050.00 → 5051.40] chairs, even though they're different
[5051.40 → 5053.32] and unique and particular, and say
[5053.32 → 5053.96] chair.
[5055.38 → 5055.90] Right?
[5055.90 → 5058.98] There's something of an idea of chair
[5058.98 → 5061.34] that transcends the particular
[5061.34 → 5063.96] instances of chair.
[5065.36 → 5067.54] Now, I get that that part makes sense
[5067.54 → 5070.06] because a chair is a concrete thing.
[5070.36 → 5071.90] It's something that we sit on and we
[5071.90 → 5072.56] can touch it.
[5072.86 → 5074.12] But what about something a little bit
[5074.12 → 5074.94] more enigmatic?
[5075.94 → 5076.06] Right?
[5076.08 → 5078.36] What about meaning in suffering?
[5079.72 → 5081.94] What about purposes in pain?
[5083.28 → 5085.40] What about the famous question, what is
[5085.40 → 5086.30] the meaning of life?
[5087.68 → 5088.82] And if you want a more compelling
[5088.82 → 5092.20] answer than 42, you have to look for
[5092.20 → 5094.02] something that transcends life.
[5094.90 → 5096.56] Something that can tie it all together.
[5097.48 → 5099.16] Something that is over and above the
[5099.16 → 5101.90] particular instances of our days and
[5101.90 → 5102.52] our moments.
[5103.30 → 5105.20] To have a meaningful answer to the
[5105.20 → 5107.38] question, why is there something
[5107.38 → 5109.96] rather than nothing, there has to be
[5109.96 → 5113.18] something or someone over all the
[5113.18 → 5114.12] other something's.
[5115.40 → 5120.24] Turns out, this is the only way to make
[5120.24 → 5124.78] meaningful sense of everything and
[5124.78 → 5127.60] therefore meaningful sense of anything.
[5127.60 → 5132.76] This is precisely what Jesus means in
[5132.76 → 5135.10] Matthew 16 when he says,
[5136.26 → 5138.94] For whoever wants to save his life will
[5138.94 → 5142.06] lose it, but whoever loses his life for me
[5142.06 → 5143.16] will find it.
[5143.60 → 5146.40] What good will it be for a man if he gains
[5146.40 → 5150.06] the whole world, yet forfeits his soul?
[5150.06 → 5154.40] Jesus is echoing the teacher's question.
[5156.22 → 5158.56] You can gain everything under the sun.
[5158.88 → 5161.56] Wealth, pleasure, status, even the whole
[5161.56 → 5161.96] world.
[5162.22 → 5165.92] But if it's apart from God, there's no gain
[5165.92 → 5166.22] at all.
[5167.30 → 5169.30] There's no goodness in it.
[5169.66 → 5173.08] Gaining good things, but being without God
[5173.08 → 5174.62] isn't good at all.
[5174.72 → 5175.68] It's meaningless.
[5175.68 → 5177.20] It's enigmatic.
[5177.34 → 5180.00] It's a vapour that vanishes as soon as you try to
[5180.00 → 5181.18] lay hold of it.
[5182.32 → 5187.12] Any gain apart from God is no gain at all.
[5188.40 → 5191.34] And the teacher is pressing us to see that our
[5191.34 → 5194.72] striving for profit, that our endless attempts at
[5194.72 → 5199.06] self-made meaning all collapse when they're cut off
[5199.06 → 5199.76] from our Creator.
[5201.28 → 5204.20] But the good news is, the good news, the gospel
[5204.20 → 5207.98] is that it is only in God through Christ that we
[5207.98 → 5211.78] find meaning and that our labour gains not just a
[5211.78 → 5218.42] momentary purpose, but an eternal weight and purpose.
[5219.24 → 5224.02] I love this line from 2 Corinthians 4, verse 17.
[5224.02 → 5225.12] It says,
[5225.66 → 5230.00] For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us
[5230.00 → 5234.96] an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison.
[5236.66 → 5240.84] Suffering has purpose because God is God.
[5241.14 → 5242.90] And without God, there's no purpose.
[5243.06 → 5243.88] There's only guesswork.
[5245.26 → 5247.18] And that's the thing.
[5248.32 → 5251.88] Jesus, living the life I should have lived and dying the
[5251.88 → 5255.04] death that I deserve is more than just an example for my
[5255.04 → 5255.32] life.
[5255.56 → 5256.82] It is my life.
[5257.94 → 5260.54] Jesus dying means that you are free.
[5260.94 → 5264.94] And Jesus' resurrection means that you are raised to life.
[5265.16 → 5266.20] Real life.
[5266.86 → 5268.50] Meaningful life.
[5270.58 → 5275.54] The Belgic Confession, which is a statement of faith in the
[5275.54 → 5278.02] Reformed tradition that comes from the 16th century, in
[5278.02 → 5280.76] article 12, says this beautifully.
[5280.76 → 5286.88] It says that God has given all creatures their being, form, and
[5286.88 → 5291.16] appearance, and their various functions for serving their
[5291.16 → 5291.84] creator.
[5293.36 → 5296.92] That's the answer to one of the oldest and deepest questions.
[5297.44 → 5298.26] Why am I here?
[5299.46 → 5304.94] The confession answer is for serving our God and creator.
[5306.36 → 5308.74] The Westminster Shorter Catechism puts it the same way.
[5308.74 → 5310.48] What is the chief end of man?
[5310.58 → 5313.58] To glorify God and enjoy Him forever.
[5314.86 → 5315.88] There it is.
[5316.98 → 5322.20] The search for gain, for profit, for meaning ends here.
[5323.34 → 5328.98] It lands here in worship and in serving God.
[5328.98 → 5333.94] Under the sun, apart from God, all of our labour, all of our lives are
[5333.94 → 5334.60] without meaning.
[5334.80 → 5339.82] But, listen to how the Apostle Paul inverts this in 1 Corinthians 15.
[5339.98 → 5340.22] He says,
[5340.64 → 5345.52] Therefore, my beloved, be steadfast, immovable, and always excelling in
[5345.52 → 5350.06] the work in the Lord, because you know that in the Lord your labour is not in
[5350.06 → 5350.34] vain.
[5351.10 → 5352.14] That's the contrast.
[5352.62 → 5353.78] That's the difference, right?
[5353.78 → 5356.02] Under the sun, all is vanity.
[5357.40 → 5361.48] But in the Lord, your labour is not in vain.
[5362.32 → 5364.30] That's the reversal of the gospel.
[5365.38 → 5369.18] What Christ redeems, He gives back with purpose.
[5370.04 → 5377.26] Your life, your work, your service, they matter eternally when they are done in Him and for
[5377.26 → 5377.94] Him.
[5377.94 → 5383.14] And so, if you're looking for meaning, if you're looking for purpose, if you're looking
[5383.14 → 5387.22] for answers to the fundamental questions of life, look here.
[5388.04 → 5389.34] Look to God's Word.
[5389.58 → 5394.70] Look to the person of Jesus Christ in His life, in His death, and in His resurrection.
[5395.04 → 5397.04] Look to the cross of God's grace.
[5398.08 → 5401.92] The teacher said that apart from God, there is nothing new under the sun.
[5401.92 → 5408.48] But God, through Jesus Christ, who lived and died for you, that says there is something
[5408.48 → 5408.92] new.
[5409.84 → 5409.96] Right?
[5410.04 → 5411.96] Paul says this in 2 Corinthians again.
[5412.06 → 5416.08] If anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation.
[5416.96 → 5418.40] The old is passed away.
[5419.28 → 5421.38] The new has come.
[5422.68 → 5424.32] Under the sun, there's nothing new.
[5424.72 → 5427.92] But in the sun, you are made new.
[5427.92 → 5428.20] Right?
[5429.46 → 5435.50] The futility of life lived under the sun is replaced by a joy of resurrection life in
[5435.50 → 5436.04] the sun.
[5436.40 → 5442.44] Our labours are not in vain because in Him, eternity breaks into our every day.
[5443.84 → 5445.66] And that changes how we live.
[5445.78 → 5447.02] It changes how we see.
[5447.48 → 5450.88] And I pray, oh man, do I pray that this changes the corners of Reddit.
[5450.88 → 5451.52] Right?
[5451.52 → 5452.32] Right?
[5452.40 → 5457.18] When days seem to drudge on, when one day bleeds into the next and everything feels like
[5457.18 → 5464.74] endless repetition, remember Christ who gives purpose and joy even in the ordinary.
[5465.74 → 5469.60] Who actually has promised to meet you in the ordinary.
[5469.60 → 5478.14] And when the temptation rises in you to believe that you are in control, that gain and profit
[5478.14 → 5485.22] and purpose depend on our effort, recall the teacher's words, apart from God, there is
[5485.22 → 5486.92] no meaning or purpose.
[5487.08 → 5492.36] But in Him, in Him, our joy is made complete.
[5492.36 → 5498.92] And so may this truth settle deeply in us.
[5500.26 → 5506.92] And under the sun, all is vanity, but in the sun, nothing is in vain.
[5507.58 → 5513.02] Your life has meaning and purpose because of Jesus.
[5513.48 → 5520.68] And so live your life for the purposes of Jesus.
[5521.50 → 5521.76] Amen?
[5522.36 → 5523.80] Let's pray together.
[5527.50 → 5532.82] Lord Jesus, open our eyes to your purposes.
[5534.34 → 5542.20] Move in us today that we might live our lives built on you and your word as the foundation.
[5543.42 → 5548.10] May you, Lord Jesus, become for us the only cornerstone.
[5548.10 → 5554.10] The firm foundation on which we can live and move.
[5554.24 → 5557.02] In you, we have our being.
[5558.56 → 5562.22] And so today, inspire our hearts.
[5562.22 → 5572.46] Today, give us new Holy Spirit imaginations that we might see the very drudgeries of life,
[5572.56 → 5580.68] the very repetitions of the ordinary, the very meaninglessness of these moments as actually,
[5581.68 → 5583.82] only for you.
[5583.82 → 5584.82] And in being for you.
[5584.82 → 5587.00] And in being for you.
[5587.00 → 5590.22] In living life before the face of God.
[5590.22 → 5594.50] In living to worship and enjoy you.
[5594.50 → 5598.30] In serving our God and creator.
[5598.30 → 5606.72] May we know a purpose and a wholeness that transcends every moment.
[5606.72 → 5610.34] that fills up every struggle.
[5611.66 → 5617.26] And that encourages and holds every tear.
[5618.38 → 5619.66] Every point of pain.
[5621.44 → 5625.04] May we know that you are with us.
[5625.04 → 5627.50] In Jesus' name we pray.
[5628.14 → 5628.48] Amen.
[5628.48 → 5628.58] Amen.
[5655.04 → 5662.62] You're built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[5664.80 → 5669.10] I dare not trust the sweetest grace,
[5670.62 → 5675.46] but holy trust in Jesus' name.
[5675.46 → 5689.02] I'm still on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[5691.02 → 5701.86] I dare not trust the sweetest praise, but only trust in Jesus' name.
[5701.86 → 5717.98] Christ alone, born as born, He made strong, Saviour's love through the storm.
[5717.98 → 5725.06] He is Lord, Lord of all.
[5725.06 → 5740.06] When darkness seems to hide His face, I rest on His unchanging grace.
[5740.06 → 5752.06] In every high and stormy day, my anchor holds within the veil.
[5752.06 → 5758.06] My anchor holds within the veil.
[5759.06 → 5767.06] Christ alone, born as born, He made strong.
[5767.06 → 5779.06] In Saviour's love through the storm, He is born for a long.
[5779.06 → 5788.06] He shall come with trumpet sound.
[5788.06 → 5794.06] O may I then in Him be found.
[5794.06 → 5800.06] Dressed in His righteousness alone.
[5800.06 → 5807.06] Father, stand before the Lord.
[5807.06 → 5828.06] Christ alone, born as born, He made strong.
[5828.06 → 5835.06] Christ alone, born as born, He made strong.
[5835.06 → 5843.06] He made strong, Saviour's love through the storm.
[5843.06 → 5850.06] He is Lord, Lord of all.
[5850.06 → 5857.06] Christ alone, born as born, He made strong.
[5857.06 → 5860.06] Christ alone, born as born, He made strong.
[5860.06 → 5871.06] In Saviour's love through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all.
[5871.06 → 5885.06] Christ alone, born as born, He made strong.
[5885.06 → 5892.06] As you go into this week, go as those who know your labours in the Lord are not in vain,
[5892.06 → 5896.06] and so go to labour for the Lord.
[5896.06 → 5905.06] Go as those who know God goes with you, and so receive His blessing for the journey of faith ahead.
[5905.06 → 5907.06] God, go before you to lead you.
[5907.06 → 5910.06] God, go behind you to protect you.
[5910.06 → 5913.06] God, go beneath you to support you.
[5913.06 → 5916.06] And God, go beside you to befriend you.
[5916.06 → 5918.06] Do not be afraid.
[5918.06 → 5920.06] Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[5920.06 → 5927.06] Do not be afraid, but go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
[5927.06 → 5928.06] Amen.
[5950.06 → 5959.06] You are the only comfort in my life and in my death.
[5959.06 → 5965.06] You have fully paid for all my sins and all my debt.
[5965.06 → 5971.06] Even when I struggle to believe,
[5971.06 → 5977.06] With compassion I do believe.
[5977.06 → 6000.30] I am not my own, I belong, but in soul, in my life and in prayer, to you, Lord Christ, my Lord.
[6007.06 → 6018.42] You've preserved my life in such a way that I love you, not a hair can pull from me unless you will with you.
[6018.42 → 6029.26] Even when I'm lost in desperation, all things work together for my salvation.
[6029.26 → 6053.04] I am not my own, I belong, but in soul, in my life and in prayer, to you, Lord Christ, my Lord.
[6059.26 → 6089.24] I am not my own, I belong, but in soul, in my life and in prayer, to you, Lord Christ, my Lord.
[6089.24 → 6099.24] Even when I can't see my way through, from now on to always with you.
[6099.24 → 6123.48] I am not my own, I belong, but in soul, in my life and in prayer, to you, Lord Christ, my Lord.
[6123.48 → 6146.48] I am not my own, I belong, but in prayer, to you, Lord Christ, my Lord.
[6146.48 → 6169.48] I am not my own, I belong, but in soul, in my life and in prayer, to you, Lord Christ, my Lord.
[6176.48 → 6178.48] I am not my own, I belong, but in soul, in my life and in prayer, to you, Lord Christ, my Lord.
[6178.48 → 6182.48] I am not my own, I belong, but in soul, in my life and in prayer, to you, Lord Christ, my Lord.
[6182.48 → 6188.48] I am not my own, I belong, but in soul, in my life and in prayer, to you, Lord Christ, my Lord.
[6188.48 → 6192.48] I am not my own, I belong, but in soul, in my life and in prayer, to you, Lord Christ, my Lord.
[6192.48 → 6222.46] I am not my own, I belong, but in soul, in my life and in prayer, to you, Lord Christ, my Lord.
[6222.46 → 6252.44] I am not my own, I belong, but in soul, in my life and in prayer, to you, Lord Christ, my Lord.
[6252.46 → 6257.46] I am not my own, I belong, but in soul, in my life and in prayer, to you, Lord Christ, my Lord.
[6282.46 → 6284.46] Thank you.
[6312.46 → 6342.44] Thank you.
[6342.46 → 6372.44] Thank you.
[6372.46 → 6402.44] Thank you.
[6402.46 → 6432.44] Thank you.
[6432.46 → 6462.44] Thank you.
[6462.46 → 6492.44] Thank you.
[6492.46 → 6522.44] Thank you.
[6522.46 → 6552.44] Thank you.
