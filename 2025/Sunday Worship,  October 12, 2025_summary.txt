• Jeremiah's letter to the exiles in Babylon, written around 597 BC, contains instructions for them to settle down, plant gardens, marry, and increase in number
• The letter encourages the exiles to seek the peace and prosperity of their new city and pray for it because if it prospers, they will prosper as well
• God's people are strangers and foreigners in a foreign land, but God is with them and guides them through exile

• God uses all things, including hard times, to shape His people for His glory.
• Believers are called to trust and give thanks to a big God who loves them more than they can understand.
• God's people are to live fully, contributing to society, growing in number, and working for the good of creation.
• This is in line with God's original command in Genesis 1:28 to be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, subdue it, and have dominion over all living things.
• The creational mandate in Genesis is about creating, cultivating, and ruling over creation under God's authority.
• This pattern of responsibility continues through the Bible with Adam, Noah, and Abraham, who are called to create, preserve life, and be a blessing to others.
• Jeremiah reminds his people that this plan still applies even when they are in exile, and especially during difficult times.
• As followers of God today, we are also foreigners on earth and citizens of the kingdom of heaven, awaiting Jesus' return to transform our lives.
• Our responsibilities as believers include contributing to society, growing in number, and remembering who rules over us.
• Exiles and foreigners in a foreign land, living by faith
• The church is in exile, with citizens belonging to God's kingdom
• Christians should live fully present in their current location while knowing their true citizenship lies elsewhere
• The world can be seen as foreign or unrecognizable at times
• The real problem is not the culture itself, but making God small and forgetting His sovereignty over the world
• The importance of not making faith fit personal politics or preferences
• The kingdom of God is already political with its own king, way, and road map
• Trying to squeeze human ideologies into God's kingdom results in a small, malleable God
• God reigns over all things, including culture and worldviews
• Understanding God's sovereignty brings patience, thankfulness, and confidence in adversity
• God's presence and power over all things, including blessings and hardships
• Jeremiah's book and its message of hope for the people of Israel in exile
• The specific passage from Jeremiah 29.11 about God's plans for a prosperous future
