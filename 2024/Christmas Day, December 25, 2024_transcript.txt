[72.20 --> 82.92]  And although I know it's a long road back

[339.16 --> 349.34]  My baby, heaven sent you to me.
[349.34 --> 355.48]  All the world's been praying.
[357.10 --> 362.34]  Who will save?
[362.34 --> 392.32]  But who am I that here tonight I hold the one who'll bring this light?
[392.34 --> 398.26]  Hallelujah, we've been found.
[398.68 --> 405.84]  A child is born to save us now, Jesus.
[407.10 --> 411.82]  Hallelujah, light has come.
[412.24 --> 418.36]  A Savior who will set us free.
[418.36 --> 426.28]  The promise for those who believe.
[426.28 --> 446.28]  Do you hear the angels sing for you, my baby?
[446.28 --> 460.28]  Men and kings have come to bow to you.
[460.28 --> 474.62]  But here in my arms, so close to me.
[474.62 --> 480.62]  The Son of God.
[482.54 --> 488.12]  Now all can see.
[488.12 --> 496.04]  Hallelujah, we've been found.
[496.04 --> 503.96]  A child is born to save us now, Jesus.
[504.96 --> 509.48]  Hallelujah, light has come.

[527.04 --> 531.64]  So praise to God on high.
[531.64 --> 536.66]  He has heard our cry.
[536.66 --> 539.58]  He has heard our cry.
[543.32 --> 553.42]  Hallelujah, we've been found.
[553.42 --> 555.42]  Amen.
[583.42 --> 586.46]  Set us free.

[602.22 --> 604.22]  Amen.
[604.22 --> 605.22]  Amen.
[609.22 --> 610.06]  Good.
[611.68 --> 613.26]  We'll wait for that to land.
[613.26 --> 614.18]  Good morning.
[615.36 --> 616.60]  Merry Christmas.
[617.80 --> 620.52]  Welcome to church this morning.
[620.72 --> 622.14]  A very special welcome.
[622.14 --> 625.92]  If you are a guest with us, we are so glad that you are here.
[626.30 --> 630.50]  As you can see, people are looking for places and spaces to sit.
[631.10 --> 633.80]  And so there is a few empty seats up here,
[633.88 --> 636.50]  although I think the Alchemists have put seat chairs down there.
[636.72 --> 638.96]  But I want to encourage you, if you can,
[638.96 --> 643.18]  maybe move to the middle of your row so that,
[643.42 --> 644.20]  oh, the Alchemists are there.
[644.28 --> 644.96]  Whose coat is that?
[646.56 --> 647.20]  Oh, there.
[647.32 --> 647.76]  There you go.
[648.34 --> 649.40]  We're figuring it out.
[649.70 --> 650.78]  If you can move to the middle,
[650.88 --> 654.34]  that helps everybody come in and find a space together.
[654.34 --> 662.12]  We are excited to share in this Christmas worship with you this morning.
[662.12 --> 666.82]  Before we begin, just one reminder that on Saturday,
[667.10 --> 669.86]  this coming Saturday at 1.15,
[670.22 --> 674.92]  we have booked the ice sheet at Canlan Arena,
[675.80 --> 677.10]  formerly Twin Rinks.
[677.10 --> 681.34]  And so if you want to come and join us for a church family skate,
[681.42 --> 682.74]  we would love to see you there.
[682.96 --> 684.84]  They have some rentals there,
[684.98 --> 686.42]  and so you can keep that in mind.
[686.52 --> 689.90]  But if you would like to guarantee that you can get on the ice,
[690.16 --> 691.00]  bring your own skates.
[691.16 --> 693.72]  That will help facilitate that.
[694.22 --> 697.12]  At about 2 o'clock until about 3 o'clock,
[697.22 --> 699.18]  we have the room there booked as well,
[699.20 --> 703.06]  so we can have some hot chocolate afterwards and hang out in that time.
[703.08 --> 704.44]  If you have any questions about that,
[704.44 --> 707.68]  there's a poster on the door on the way out,
[707.76 --> 710.70]  and in the screen, the rolling announcements as well.
[710.80 --> 711.62]  There are details there,
[711.70 --> 714.30]  or you can grab me or Pastor Kevin or someone else
[714.30 --> 715.46]  who looks like they know what they're doing,
[715.56 --> 716.34]  and they'll answer you.
[717.72 --> 721.48]  We're going to gather this morning in song and in prayer and in word
[721.48 --> 724.20]  in the presence of our God.
[724.28 --> 726.56]  And so I'm going to invite you, as you are able to stand,
[728.06 --> 730.00]  we're going to receive God's greeting together.
[730.00 --> 733.74]  So I invite you to take a posture of receipt
[733.74 --> 735.96]  as God welcomes us into this place.
[736.44 --> 739.26]  And following that, I'm just going to invite you to turn to those around you,
[739.40 --> 741.16]  welcome them into worship.
[742.18 --> 744.62]  After we have welcomed each other in worship,
[744.62 --> 746.84]  I invite you just to take a seat for a moment,
[746.84 --> 749.44]  and we will light the Christmas candle together.
[750.06 --> 752.78]  Receive the greeting of our God this morning.
[752.78 --> 758.28]  The Lord bless you and keep you.
[759.10 --> 762.60]  The Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[763.54 --> 768.58]  The Lord turn his face toward you and give you his peace.
[769.66 --> 769.98]  Amen.

[844.80 --> 848.92]  we may be found ready like shiny lamps prepared for his arrival.

[853.66 --> 858.30]  dispelling the darkness of sin and bringing the gift of eternal life.

[1696.28 --> 1704.92]  To the peace of, to the peace of, who God delights in.
[1704.92 --> 1714.44]  To the peace of, who God delights in, who God delights in.
[1714.44 --> 1731.58]  Glory to God, glory to God, in the highest, in the highest, in the highest.
[1731.58 --> 1751.66]  Praise the honor, praise the honor, to the peace of, who God delights in.
[1751.66 --> 1755.86]  Amen.
[1757.86 --> 1761.42]  Amen.
[1761.58 --> 1762.58]  Amen.
[1762.58 --> 1764.58]  Amen.
[1779.40 --> 1782.58]  Good morning and Merry Christmas to everybody.
[1782.72 --> 1783.94]  Merry Christmas from the Deacons.
[1784.08 --> 1791.06]  This morning we are having our offering and it will be for the budget as well as for benevolence.
[1791.06 --> 1797.86]  And we thank this congregation for the generous donations that have been given throughout this year.
[1798.42 --> 1803.06]  We pray that, we know that God has blessed us and we pray that that will continue.
[1803.66 --> 1805.50]  Please give as God has given to you.
[1805.50 --> 1813.68]  all fine with us and we pray that the Lord has done and must be no means of blessing God.
[1813.68 --> 1817.64]  We pray that Godは破綻.
[1817.64 --> 1835.72]  Over the skies of Bethlehem appeared a star
[1835.72 --> 1842.24]  While angels sent to holy shepherds
[1842.24 --> 1850.00]  Realizement seeking truth traveled from afar
[1850.00 --> 1856.14]  Hoping to find the child from heaven
[1856.14 --> 1861.28]  Following on at ease
[1861.28 --> 1868.88]  They bow before the humble Prince of Peace
[1868.88 --> 1874.88]  We bring an offering of worship to our King
[1874.88 --> 1881.88]  No one on earth deserves the praises that we sing
[1882.44 --> 1888.88]  Jesus, may you receive the honor that you're due
[1889.44 --> 1896.88]  O Lord, we bring an offering to you
[1898.88 --> 1916.64]  The sun cannot compare to the glory of your love
[1916.64 --> 1921.88]  There is no shadow in your presence
[1921.88 --> 1929.88]  No more to let we dare to stand before your throne
[1929.88 --> 1935.88]  We know you're the Holy One of Heaven
[1935.88 --> 1941.88]  It's only by your blood
[1941.88 --> 1945.88]  And it's only through your mercy
[1945.88 --> 1949.88]  Lord, I come
[1949.88 --> 1955.88]  I bring an offering of worship to my King
[1955.88 --> 1961.88]  No one on earth deserves the praises that I sing
[1961.88 --> 1969.88]  Jesus, may you receive the honor that you're due
[1969.88 --> 1975.88]  O Lord, I bring an offering to you
[1975.88 --> 1976.88]  O Lord, I bring an offering to you
[1976.88 --> 1981.88]  I bring an offering of worship to my King
[1981.88 --> 1987.88]  No one on earth deserves the praises that I sing
[1987.88 --> 1997.88]  Jesus, may you receive the honor that you're due
[1997.88 --> 2001.88]  O Lord, I bring an offering to you
[2001.88 --> 2005.88]  O Lord, I bring an offering to you
[2005.88 --> 2012.88]  O Lord, I bring an offering to you
[2012.88 --> 2030.88]  O Lord, I bring an offering to you
[2030.88 --> 2046.56]  I would love to invite all the kids to come forward if you are willing.
[2046.92 --> 2048.44]  Come meet me up here just for a minute.
[2049.04 --> 2050.98]  We'll have a quick chat here for a second.
[2050.98 --> 2055.44]  On this Christmas day, here comes a bunch.
[2060.88 --> 2070.08]  Merry Christmas, everyone.
[2070.08 --> 2073.18]  Oh, you know what?
[2073.22 --> 2075.94]  You guys are way louder when I have a dog puppet up here.
[2077.02 --> 2078.42]  Merry Christmas, everyone.
[2079.10 --> 2080.18]  Merry Christmas.
[2080.70 --> 2082.38]  Now, I have a quick question for you all.
[2084.56 --> 2086.96]  Did any of you open any presents this morning?
[2087.72 --> 2087.94]  Yeah?
[2088.14 --> 2089.80]  How many of you opened presents already?
[2089.80 --> 2092.56]  How many of you are going to open presents soon?
[2093.60 --> 2095.70]  Now, why do we open presents on Christmas?
[2096.20 --> 2099.42]  That's a normal thing, but why do we do that?
[2109.78 --> 2110.18]  Yeah?
[2111.58 --> 2113.02]  Oh, we're going to get a whole rundown.
[2114.24 --> 2115.18]  Oh, wow.
[2115.40 --> 2116.18]  That's exciting.
[2117.60 --> 2118.16]  I know.
[2118.16 --> 2120.22]  Oh, so some people open at Christmas, presents Christmas Eve.
[2120.28 --> 2121.16]  Some open Christmas Day.
[2121.36 --> 2122.52]  Why do we open them at all?
[2124.28 --> 2126.32]  Because, oh, you are so good, Haley.
[2126.50 --> 2131.02]  We open presents because Christmas is the day that we got the gift of Jesus.
[2131.66 --> 2133.82]  Do you remember some of you were in children's worship time on Sunday,
[2133.88 --> 2136.78]  and we talked about how Jesus is our forever king.
[2137.26 --> 2138.20]  Do you know what Jesus did?
[2139.20 --> 2140.34]  Jesus came.
[2140.46 --> 2142.66]  He was already our king before he was born.
[2142.66 --> 2147.22]  He came down from a throne in heaven, the Bible says, to become a baby.
[2147.94 --> 2148.72]  Isn't that something?
[2148.80 --> 2150.92]  And he did that to save us all from our sins.
[2151.12 --> 2155.40]  So he was a king, and then he came down to earth to be a baby king.
[2155.96 --> 2160.64]  And then he died on the cross and rose again and went back to heaven to continue to be our king.
[2160.94 --> 2163.04]  So he's not just our forever king going forward.
[2163.14 --> 2164.44]  He was our forever king forever.
[2164.44 --> 2168.50]  And then he came, and he became a baby for us.
[2168.54 --> 2169.22]  Isn't that something?
[2169.98 --> 2170.54]  Isn't that something?
[2170.64 --> 2175.32]  So that's what we're celebrating today, and that's what we're going to hear Pastor Chris talk about in his message.
[2175.40 --> 2178.48]  So I'm going to pray, and then today we're going to sit back with our parents,
[2178.56 --> 2182.30]  and we're going to listen to Pastor Chris talk about the meaning of Christmas for us today, okay?
[2182.48 --> 2186.50]  If you didn't, there are some activities at the children's worship time booth that you can do.
[2186.70 --> 2188.32]  I think there's some stickers and stuff like that.
[2188.38 --> 2191.40]  So you can go grab those as well after we pray if you want, okay?
[2191.78 --> 2192.30]  Let me pray.
[2192.30 --> 2194.56]  Dear God, thank you so much for this day.
[2194.66 --> 2199.68]  Thank you that we could be here today on Christmas Day, so excited to celebrate your birth, God.
[2199.72 --> 2203.22]  And we just, we pray that you'll help us remember that you are our forever king,
[2203.28 --> 2206.30]  that you came down from the throne of heaven to become a baby for us,
[2206.78 --> 2212.70]  to eventually grow up to a man, to die on the cross, and to rise again for all of our sins.
[2212.80 --> 2216.42]  And God, may we remember that this is the day that you are the greatest gift that we could receive.
[2216.76 --> 2217.78]  We pray this in your name.
[2218.44 --> 2218.80]  Amen.
[2218.80 --> 2219.00]  Amen.
[2219.66 --> 2220.08]  All right.
[2220.74 --> 2221.28]  You know what?
[2221.38 --> 2221.80]  Let's do it.
[2221.80 --> 2223.48]  We do this at our church all the time.
[2223.56 --> 2224.14]  Let's do it anyways.
[2224.20 --> 2225.78]  We're not going anywhere, but let's all stand up.
[2225.86 --> 2229.06]  We're going to do the blessing because there's some guests here that I think need to be blessed by the kids.
[2229.54 --> 2230.78]  So we're going to stand here.
[2230.86 --> 2233.08]  We're going to put our hands like this, and I'm going to count to three,
[2233.14 --> 2235.64]  and we're going to say together, the Lord be with you, okay?
[2235.74 --> 2236.22]  Are you ready?
[2236.52 --> 2237.64]  We're going to say this to the church.
[2237.92 --> 2239.10]  One, two, three.
[2239.48 --> 2241.46]  The Lord be with you.
[2242.18 --> 2243.50]  All right.
[2243.50 --> 2244.78]  You can go back to your parents' seats.
[2244.78 --> 2246.38]  All right.
[2251.80 --> 2264.28]  Good morning.
[2264.82 --> 2265.36]  Good morning.
[2265.48 --> 2266.18]  My name is Dave.
[2267.14 --> 2271.54]  I am an elder at this church, and I get to lead you in our church family prayer.
[2271.54 --> 2272.96]  Will you pray with me?
[2272.96 --> 2281.70]  Father, it is with great joy that we gather on this Christmas day.
[2282.10 --> 2285.72]  It is a time that we join with Christians of all times and of all ages,
[2285.96 --> 2288.40]  and we celebrate the profound importance of this day,
[2288.90 --> 2292.96]  that Jesus chose to take on human form, taking on the very nature of a servant.
[2292.96 --> 2298.50]  It is a marvelous thought that the word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.
[2299.18 --> 2301.38]  Like the shepherds, we hear the message from the angels.
[2301.74 --> 2304.70]  I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people.
[2305.22 --> 2307.76]  Today in the town of David, a Savior has been born to you.
[2308.12 --> 2309.36]  He is Christ the Lord.
[2310.26 --> 2313.26]  And because of this good news, we sing with the angels,
[2313.84 --> 2318.22]  glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.
[2318.22 --> 2323.68]  Father, even with the joy of Christmas, we need to confess that we are sinful people.
[2324.48 --> 2328.84]  It is because of human sin and human rebellion that we need to be reconciled to you,
[2329.18 --> 2330.94]  and that Jesus needed to come down,
[2331.50 --> 2336.74]  and that the child in the manger needed to grow, live a humble life, and die on a cross.
[2337.66 --> 2342.82]  We confess that we get caught up in the many distractions and the excess of this season.
[2343.54 --> 2345.56]  Help us to remember the real purpose of Christmas,
[2345.56 --> 2349.36]  to celebrate the very humble beginnings of our faith in a stable.
[2350.66 --> 2353.64]  Father, we come to you because we have many reasons to be thankful.
[2354.22 --> 2358.06]  We thank you for the joy and celebration that we felt in this time of Advent.
[2358.72 --> 2362.08]  We thank you for this church family and everyone who has gathered here.
[2362.86 --> 2364.82]  We thank you for the leadership of this church,
[2365.10 --> 2368.54]  with Pastor Chris, Pastor Kevin, and Josh.
[2368.84 --> 2370.36]  We thank you for members of the council.
[2370.36 --> 2376.70]  We pray for wisdom for them, that they may provide good leadership and decisions for us.
[2377.22 --> 2379.60]  We thank you for the many ministries of this church,
[2379.98 --> 2384.66]  the nursery, children's worship time, gems, cadets, youth, young adults,
[2384.98 --> 2388.58]  the Mexico team, coffee break, care groups, seniors ministry.
[2389.14 --> 2391.12]  We ask that you bless the work that they do,
[2391.36 --> 2395.42]  that they may meet the spiritual and physical needs that we see around us.
[2395.42 --> 2401.70]  Father, as a church community, we think of the joys and needs that we have as a Christian community.
[2402.24 --> 2405.54]  We pray for those who use this time to travel, to be with extended family.
[2406.02 --> 2408.42]  We pray for safe travels and a meaningful time together.
[2409.90 --> 2412.12]  Father, in the midst of all the joy and celebration,
[2412.38 --> 2414.70]  we realize that this may be a time that is difficult.
[2415.36 --> 2417.80]  We pray for those who experience hardship or loneliness,
[2418.28 --> 2420.38]  and for those who grieve the loss of a loved one.
[2420.80 --> 2424.28]  We pray that they may feel your comfort, your peace, and your presence.
[2424.28 --> 2428.22]  And we pray that all of us may be a source of light and compassion.
[2429.10 --> 2432.74]  We pray for Elise Wagenau's father, Doug, as he continues his health struggles
[2432.74 --> 2434.56]  and the news of a tumor on his spine.
[2435.08 --> 2438.50]  We pray for patience and strength as the family takes this journey together.
[2439.16 --> 2443.04]  We pray for Amanda Hogan's sister and Klaus Tessamacher's daughter, Tanya,
[2443.58 --> 2446.62]  who is experiencing stage 4 breast cancer that has spread.
[2447.24 --> 2449.20]  We pray for her and her family,
[2449.54 --> 2453.40]  that they may feel your comfort, peace, healing, and hope.
[2453.40 --> 2460.18]  And Father, we pray for Pastor Chris as he leads us again in the study of our word
[2460.18 --> 2462.62]  as revealed to the prophet Isaiah.
[2463.26 --> 2467.94]  We thank you that, unlike Isaiah, we don't have to wait for the coming of the Messiah
[2467.94 --> 2473.62]  because he has already come, the word made flesh, Emmanuel, God with us.
[2474.40 --> 2477.28]  May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God
[2477.28 --> 2480.28]  and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with us all.
[2481.04 --> 2481.30]  Amen.
[2481.30 --> 2481.38]  Amen.
[2483.40 --> 2513.36]  As we begin this morning here in a reflection on God's word on Christmas Day,
[2513.36 --> 2516.50]  I just want to take a moment right at the outset
[2516.50 --> 2519.94]  and acknowledge something with you this morning.
[2520.02 --> 2523.84]  Something strange, weird, and mysterious.
[2523.84 --> 2529.34]  Because when you get right down to it, Christmas is weird.
[2530.58 --> 2531.64]  Christmas is strange.
[2532.70 --> 2537.54]  Honestly, pull back all the 21st century dressings,
[2537.54 --> 2539.68]  the music and the malls and the parties,
[2539.68 --> 2542.20]  the lights and the turkey dinners.
[2542.20 --> 2545.52]  Most of the time, good things, depending on who's cooking.
[2546.32 --> 2548.06]  Pull all of that back, right?
[2548.14 --> 2551.58]  Pull the history of Christian cultural influence.
[2552.08 --> 2557.74]  Pull back pop Christmas music and music specials, Christmas specials.
[2558.00 --> 2560.96]  Pull back the sleigh bells and the Christmas trees.
[2560.96 --> 2564.10]  Look behind that curtain of cultural Christmas.
[2564.10 --> 2568.10]  And Christmas should be impossible.
[2568.10 --> 2568.66]  Impossible.
[2568.66 --> 2577.70]  Now, very aware of the fact that enough of you here this morning
[2577.70 --> 2582.74]  have grown up in the church or are at least church adjacent.
[2582.74 --> 2587.56]  And what I mean by that is that we have family or friends
[2587.56 --> 2590.06]  who invited us to come here this morning
[2590.06 --> 2591.98]  and we came because we love them
[2591.98 --> 2596.30]  or because it was a condition for opening presents later on in the day
[2596.30 --> 2598.64]  or for eating Christmas dinner, and so we're here.
[2600.32 --> 2604.94]  Most of us here this morning have been around long enough
[2604.94 --> 2608.48]  for this truth that Christmas is strange
[2608.48 --> 2611.12]  is easy to miss.
[2612.66 --> 2617.22]  It's easy to miss the impossible nature of this day.
[2617.52 --> 2619.68]  We can become numb to the miracle
[2619.68 --> 2624.02]  or we can take for granted the majesty of this mystery.
[2625.82 --> 2631.94]  Or maybe you're not even sure what you believe about this Jesus guy,
[2632.12 --> 2635.24]  but you still like Christmas, right?
[2635.24 --> 2639.02]  For so many people today, Christmas has become a reason
[2639.02 --> 2640.76]  to take a few days off of work,
[2641.08 --> 2644.58]  to give a couple presents, maybe even to give one or two.
[2645.02 --> 2648.14]  Christmas has become a time where you can go up the mountains
[2648.14 --> 2649.78]  to ski or snowboard,
[2649.86 --> 2653.28]  or maybe you're lucky enough to go off to Mexico or to Hawaii.
[2654.92 --> 2658.12]  Christmas, for so many, is about family traditions,
[2658.34 --> 2660.62]  about peppermint lattes and eggnog.
[2660.98 --> 2663.06]  It's about palm dauphine if you're French
[2663.06 --> 2665.48]  or malva pudding if you're from South Africa
[2665.48 --> 2667.36]  or panettone if you're Italian
[2667.36 --> 2670.08]  or peppernotin if you're Dutch.
[2671.56 --> 2673.78]  For so many of us, Christmas isn't spiritual,
[2674.06 --> 2674.72]  it's physical.
[2675.48 --> 2677.60]  It's about good food and good rest.
[2679.78 --> 2682.92]  Now, I suspect that if you're here this morning,
[2683.58 --> 2688.42]  you're somewhere in the middle of this range of possibilities.
[2688.42 --> 2688.98]  Right?
[2690.50 --> 2692.74]  Christmas comes, and we love it,
[2693.32 --> 2696.06]  but life goes on to the next thing.
[2697.42 --> 2698.24]  All right, after today,
[2698.34 --> 2701.06]  we're pretty quickly counting down to New Year's Eve parties,
[2701.46 --> 2704.20]  and then it's back to school or back to work,
[2704.92 --> 2707.64]  back to life as usual.
[2708.60 --> 2710.64]  Life as it was a few weeks ago
[2710.64 --> 2712.86]  and as it will be a few weeks from now.
[2712.86 --> 2716.48]  Christmas, the impossibility of it all,
[2716.88 --> 2719.66]  can easily be missed.
[2721.60 --> 2724.34]  And it's easy to miss in the midst of all that.
[2726.70 --> 2730.46]  We haven't even talked about the very real circumstances
[2730.46 --> 2732.34]  that some of you are in, right?
[2732.36 --> 2733.54]  Of disease and death.
[2734.56 --> 2736.00]  Of worry and work.
[2736.94 --> 2738.76]  Of what if and how come.
[2738.76 --> 2740.76]  And in the midst of all of that,
[2740.88 --> 2743.48]  this easily just becomes another season,
[2743.66 --> 2744.68]  another day, another week
[2744.68 --> 2746.18]  that we just need to get through.
[2749.64 --> 2751.00]  And if you're anywhere
[2751.00 --> 2755.32]  in those ranges of possibilities this morning,
[2755.90 --> 2758.58]  I want to take just a few minutes of our time
[2758.58 --> 2763.54]  and stoke the marvel of Christmas Day.
[2764.78 --> 2766.42]  All right, let's pause for a moment
[2766.42 --> 2769.22]  and to gander at the impossible,
[2770.00 --> 2774.08]  to lift the veil and to peer into the mystery.
[2775.34 --> 2777.90]  Now to do that, let me set the stage for you this morning.
[2778.70 --> 2781.04]  Whether or not you've been with us throughout Advent,
[2781.54 --> 2783.64]  that's the season leading up to Christmas,
[2784.20 --> 2787.02]  it won't matter as I'll give you the context here.
[2787.82 --> 2791.10]  We have been looking at the book of Isaiah,
[2791.30 --> 2792.84]  waiting with Isaiah.
[2792.84 --> 2793.24]  Isaiah.
[2793.92 --> 2798.86]  Now Isaiah is a prophet in the Jewish tradition
[2798.86 --> 2800.94]  to the people of Judah
[2800.94 --> 2804.86]  in the 8th century before Christ.
[2805.78 --> 2808.32]  He speaks the word of God to kings
[2808.32 --> 2809.78]  who have forgotten God.
[2810.42 --> 2813.52]  He speaks of the expectation of the Messiah,
[2813.94 --> 2815.34]  which means the anointed one,
[2815.44 --> 2816.88]  the true king, right?
[2816.92 --> 2819.14]  He brings a word from God to people
[2819.14 --> 2821.88]  as a division reigns in the land,
[2821.88 --> 2823.72]  as exile approaches,
[2823.72 --> 2826.50]  and as two major nation states
[2826.50 --> 2829.34]  loom large over Israel and Judah,
[2829.48 --> 2832.72]  the empire of Assyria and eventually Babylon.
[2833.78 --> 2835.66]  And where I want us to look this morning
[2835.66 --> 2838.64]  with Isaiah is in Isaiah 7.
[2839.70 --> 2841.68]  And we're going to jump into the story
[2841.68 --> 2844.04]  as King Ahaz,
[2844.36 --> 2845.98]  who's the king of Judah,
[2845.98 --> 2847.50]  has a choice to make.
[2848.72 --> 2850.30]  The background to this story
[2850.30 --> 2852.18]  is recorded for us in the Bible
[2852.18 --> 2853.92]  in 2 Kings 16.
[2855.18 --> 2858.00]  Northern Israel and Aram
[2858.00 --> 2861.80]  are threatening Judah and King Ahaz.
[2862.34 --> 2864.60]  They both want to pull Ahaz,
[2865.00 --> 2866.04]  the king of Judah,
[2866.20 --> 2867.60]  into an alliance
[2867.60 --> 2870.90]  because of the nearing and looming threat
[2870.90 --> 2872.32]  of the Assyrian Empire.
[2872.32 --> 2875.46]  Short of pulling him into an alliance,
[2876.00 --> 2877.98]  they could also topple the kingdom
[2877.98 --> 2880.26]  and annex it back.
[2881.52 --> 2884.14]  Now Ahaz instead decides
[2884.14 --> 2885.52]  he's going to approach
[2885.52 --> 2888.12]  the king of the Assyrian Empire
[2888.12 --> 2889.66]  and make a deal with him.
[2890.90 --> 2893.28]  Now, read between the lines
[2893.28 --> 2894.36]  in this story.
[2895.52 --> 2895.64]  Right?
[2895.78 --> 2896.52]  Simply put,
[2896.92 --> 2899.40]  Ahaz has a choice to make,
[2899.40 --> 2901.36]  and that choice isn't between
[2901.36 --> 2903.64]  Assyria on the one hand
[2903.64 --> 2905.88]  or Israel and Aram on the other.
[2906.14 --> 2908.70]  It's a choice between trusting God
[2908.70 --> 2910.10]  or not.
[2912.26 --> 2913.70]  And going to Assyria
[2913.70 --> 2915.04]  and making a deal with them,
[2915.14 --> 2917.32]  he took matters into his own hands
[2917.32 --> 2920.18]  and he ends up picking sides
[2920.18 --> 2921.94]  with what becomes an even greater threat
[2921.94 --> 2923.06]  to their destruction.
[2924.52 --> 2925.64]  Here's the problem
[2925.64 --> 2926.92]  that we step into.
[2926.92 --> 2931.44]  Ahaz is letting his perspective
[2931.44 --> 2934.36]  dictate reality.
[2935.80 --> 2937.66]  Ahaz is letting his perspective
[2937.66 --> 2938.98]  dictate reality.
[2939.14 --> 2940.54]  And from his point of view,
[2941.02 --> 2943.22]  the northern Israel and Aram
[2943.22 --> 2944.84]  are the major threat.
[2945.70 --> 2947.18]  But from God's point of view,
[2947.48 --> 2948.22]  those are nothing.
[2948.64 --> 2949.46]  It's not them.
[2949.60 --> 2950.70]  It's actually him.
[2950.92 --> 2952.46]  It's his heart.
[2953.82 --> 2956.86]  Ahaz missed the deeper reality
[2956.86 --> 2958.48]  of what was going on.
[2959.56 --> 2960.68]  Does that sound familiar?
[2963.16 --> 2964.36]  John Oswalt,
[2964.48 --> 2966.30]  who is a Bible scholar,
[2967.04 --> 2968.62]  is part of the translation team
[2968.62 --> 2970.24]  for the Bible version
[2970.24 --> 2972.20]  that we read here at Emmanuel.
[2972.88 --> 2973.76]  He writes,
[2974.84 --> 2975.42]  he says,
[2975.54 --> 2977.10]  we are always in danger
[2977.10 --> 2978.64]  of paying too much attention
[2978.64 --> 2979.64]  to the passing
[2979.64 --> 2981.96]  and paying too little attention
[2981.96 --> 2983.52]  to the significant.
[2987.10 --> 2988.42]  Paying too much attention
[2988.42 --> 2989.20]  to the passing
[2989.20 --> 2991.28]  and paying too little attention
[2991.28 --> 2992.92]  to the significant.
[2994.38 --> 2996.52]  If all you ever focus on
[2996.52 --> 2998.74]  is that thing right in front of you,
[2998.74 --> 3001.18]  you might miss the important thing
[3001.18 --> 3002.74]  going on around you.
[3005.22 --> 3006.08]  Ahaz's choice
[3006.08 --> 3007.64]  between trusting God
[3007.64 --> 3009.56]  or trusting himself
[3009.56 --> 3011.74]  has impacts down the line
[3011.74 --> 3012.52]  for his life
[3012.52 --> 3013.64]  and for his rule.
[3014.40 --> 3015.98]  And unless he gets to a point
[3015.98 --> 3016.94]  where he can trust
[3016.94 --> 3018.20]  in a sovereign God
[3018.20 --> 3019.06]  who is good,
[3019.38 --> 3021.16]  unless he can give himself up
[3021.16 --> 3022.26]  to God's rule
[3022.26 --> 3023.42]  and reign in his life,
[3023.86 --> 3024.92]  he will continue
[3024.92 --> 3026.10]  to be stuck
[3026.10 --> 3027.36]  in this loop
[3027.36 --> 3028.26]  of panic,
[3028.72 --> 3029.08]  fear,
[3029.38 --> 3029.90]  poor decision,
[3030.28 --> 3030.72]  consequence.
[3031.42 --> 3031.92]  Panic,
[3032.28 --> 3032.60]  fear,
[3032.94 --> 3033.40]  poor decision,
[3033.72 --> 3034.14]  consequence.
[3034.14 --> 3039.06]  It's a loop,
[3039.12 --> 3039.76]  I can keep going.
[3042.68 --> 3043.02]  Right?
[3043.06 --> 3044.38]  It's only entrusting
[3044.38 --> 3046.32]  in the real present
[3046.32 --> 3048.26]  and really present
[3048.26 --> 3049.90]  ultimate truthfulness
[3049.90 --> 3051.26]  and ultimate truth
[3051.26 --> 3052.28]  of God.
[3052.52 --> 3054.42]  Is there any real security
[3054.42 --> 3055.66]  for him
[3055.66 --> 3057.46]  in this present life?
[3057.62 --> 3059.66]  The only trusting in God
[3059.66 --> 3061.14]  breaks that loop.
[3062.60 --> 3063.80]  And so Isaiah comes
[3063.80 --> 3066.18]  and issues a challenge
[3066.18 --> 3067.14]  to Ahaz.
[3067.52 --> 3068.40]  He comes
[3068.40 --> 3069.02]  and he says
[3069.02 --> 3070.06]  to ask God
[3070.06 --> 3070.82]  for a sign.
[3070.94 --> 3072.16]  Let's look at Isaiah 10
[3072.16 --> 3073.28]  together.
[3075.44 --> 3076.00]  Again,
[3076.20 --> 3077.24]  the Lord spoke
[3077.24 --> 3078.22]  to Ahaz.
[3080.60 --> 3081.74]  Ask the Lord
[3081.74 --> 3082.28]  your God
[3082.28 --> 3083.02]  for a sign,
[3083.66 --> 3085.32]  whether in the deepest depths
[3085.32 --> 3087.38]  or in the highest heights.
[3088.80 --> 3090.26]  Ask him for anything
[3090.26 --> 3091.96]  is what Isaiah is saying.
[3092.10 --> 3093.08]  Ask for a sign
[3093.08 --> 3093.90]  to prove
[3093.90 --> 3095.24]  that your decision
[3095.24 --> 3096.64]  was a good one.
[3097.96 --> 3098.84]  But Ahaz
[3098.84 --> 3099.66]  doesn't want
[3099.66 --> 3100.40]  to be found out.
[3101.74 --> 3102.26]  Or,
[3102.46 --> 3103.84]  maybe at this point,
[3104.40 --> 3105.22]  he's choosing
[3105.22 --> 3107.08]  willful ignorance.
[3108.30 --> 3108.88]  Do you know
[3108.88 --> 3109.54]  what I mean by that?
[3110.54 --> 3110.80]  Right?
[3110.88 --> 3112.38]  He's committed himself
[3112.38 --> 3113.24]  to this course
[3113.24 --> 3113.90]  of action
[3113.90 --> 3115.14]  and he refuses
[3115.14 --> 3116.30]  to be dissuaded
[3116.30 --> 3117.64]  because that would mean
[3117.64 --> 3118.80]  admitting a mistake
[3118.80 --> 3119.62]  or admitting
[3119.62 --> 3120.58]  that he did something
[3120.58 --> 3121.20]  wrong
[3121.20 --> 3122.34]  or said something wrong.
[3122.52 --> 3122.78]  Right?
[3122.82 --> 3123.60]  You've never done that.
[3124.34 --> 3125.26]  You've never stuck
[3125.26 --> 3126.10]  to a story
[3126.10 --> 3127.06]  because you've already
[3127.06 --> 3128.44]  argued for 10 minutes straight
[3128.44 --> 3129.14]  even though
[3129.14 --> 3129.96]  eight minutes ago
[3129.96 --> 3130.78]  in your heart of hearts
[3130.78 --> 3131.34]  you admitted
[3131.34 --> 3132.12]  that you were wrong
[3132.12 --> 3132.82]  but you're not going
[3132.82 --> 3133.46]  to give in
[3133.46 --> 3134.26]  because you're not
[3134.26 --> 3134.80]  going to give her
[3134.80 --> 3135.48]  the satisfaction
[3135.48 --> 3136.26]  of knowing
[3136.26 --> 3136.98]  that she was right.
[3137.08 --> 3137.56]  You don't do that,
[3137.60 --> 3137.72]  right?
[3138.86 --> 3139.46]  Just me?
[3140.18 --> 3141.12]  Pronouns are intentional
[3141.12 --> 3141.64]  there, folks.
[3141.64 --> 3148.36]  Instead, Ahaz's response
[3148.36 --> 3150.80]  is feigned piety.
[3151.00 --> 3151.88]  Let's continue
[3151.88 --> 3153.22]  in that text.
[3154.00 --> 3154.64]  Verse 12,
[3154.78 --> 3155.56]  Ahaz said,
[3156.24 --> 3157.12]  I will not ask,
[3157.56 --> 3158.30]  I will not put
[3158.30 --> 3159.80]  the Lord to the test.
[3161.82 --> 3162.80]  Isaiah's challenge
[3162.80 --> 3163.52]  to him is
[3163.52 --> 3164.56]  ask for evidence
[3164.56 --> 3167.00]  and Ahaz's response
[3167.00 --> 3168.44]  is to bury his head
[3168.44 --> 3169.10]  in the sand
[3169.10 --> 3169.92]  into clouded
[3169.92 --> 3171.06]  and spiritual language.
[3171.64 --> 3173.24]  Now look,
[3173.80 --> 3176.40]  at this point,
[3177.64 --> 3178.90]  even the most
[3178.90 --> 3180.20]  compelling evidence
[3180.20 --> 3182.26]  will be dismissed
[3182.26 --> 3184.12]  and explained away.
[3187.38 --> 3187.60]  Okay,
[3188.60 --> 3189.36]  zoom out
[3189.36 --> 3190.14]  for a moment.
[3192.56 --> 3193.50]  Evidence
[3193.50 --> 3195.20]  does not
[3195.20 --> 3196.20]  create
[3196.20 --> 3197.22]  faith.
[3199.96 --> 3200.52]  Right?
[3200.52 --> 3201.00]  Isaiah
[3201.00 --> 3201.96]  wouldn't be able
[3201.96 --> 3202.68]  to argue
[3202.68 --> 3203.36]  Ahaz
[3203.36 --> 3204.08]  into right
[3204.08 --> 3204.54]  belief.
[3205.66 --> 3206.66]  Just like
[3206.66 --> 3207.72]  you can't argue
[3207.72 --> 3208.40]  your friend
[3208.40 --> 3209.10]  into right
[3209.10 --> 3209.50]  belief,
[3209.54 --> 3210.02]  no matter
[3210.02 --> 3210.58]  how hard
[3210.58 --> 3211.18]  you try.
[3212.02 --> 3212.34]  But,
[3213.08 --> 3213.84]  evidence
[3213.84 --> 3215.10]  confirms
[3215.10 --> 3216.20]  faith.
[3217.48 --> 3218.36]  That is,
[3218.42 --> 3218.94]  if you have
[3218.94 --> 3219.64]  the eyes
[3219.64 --> 3220.48]  to see it,
[3221.20 --> 3222.30]  you will get it.
[3222.70 --> 3223.86]  And it will be
[3223.86 --> 3224.52]  a confirmation
[3224.52 --> 3225.98]  for you.
[3226.84 --> 3227.24]  Right?
[3227.24 --> 3227.70]  where there
[3227.70 --> 3228.86]  is no faith,
[3229.12 --> 3229.54]  at least
[3229.54 --> 3230.26]  not faith
[3230.26 --> 3231.02]  in God
[3231.02 --> 3231.80]  and his word
[3231.80 --> 3232.34]  to us,
[3232.34 --> 3232.96]  where there
[3232.96 --> 3233.68]  is no faith,
[3234.02 --> 3234.38]  evidence
[3234.38 --> 3235.12]  will just
[3235.12 --> 3235.72]  have to be
[3235.72 --> 3236.68]  explained away.
[3237.78 --> 3238.34]  Evidence
[3238.34 --> 3239.06]  isn't welcome
[3239.06 --> 3241.16]  and therefore,
[3241.80 --> 3242.10]  evidence
[3242.10 --> 3243.06]  isn't seen.
[3245.68 --> 3246.38]  That's why
[3246.38 --> 3246.88]  some of you
[3246.88 --> 3247.82]  get so frustrated
[3247.82 --> 3248.92]  trying to convince
[3248.92 --> 3249.42]  your kids
[3249.42 --> 3249.94]  to believe
[3249.94 --> 3250.60]  like you do.
[3250.60 --> 3253.66]  because without
[3253.66 --> 3254.16]  the shared
[3254.16 --> 3254.64]  faith,
[3254.82 --> 3255.66]  it's really
[3255.66 --> 3256.24]  easy to
[3256.24 --> 3256.88]  explain that
[3256.88 --> 3257.62]  evidence away.
[3258.34 --> 3258.62]  One,
[3258.82 --> 3259.76]  because it's
[3259.76 --> 3260.70]  necessary to
[3260.70 --> 3261.32]  explain that
[3261.32 --> 3262.02]  evidence away
[3262.02 --> 3263.56]  and two,
[3264.28 --> 3265.08]  the evidence
[3265.08 --> 3266.38]  requires faith
[3266.38 --> 3267.24]  to make sense
[3267.24 --> 3267.58]  of it.
[3268.70 --> 3269.30]  Let's flip the
[3269.30 --> 3269.96]  coin for a second,
[3270.04 --> 3270.14]  right?
[3270.38 --> 3271.44]  The very same
[3271.44 --> 3273.14]  reason a strict
[3273.14 --> 3274.40]  naturalist finds
[3274.40 --> 3274.92]  it impossible
[3274.92 --> 3275.78]  to believe
[3275.78 --> 3276.86]  in a creation
[3276.86 --> 3278.34]  account is
[3278.34 --> 3279.40]  why you find
[3279.40 --> 3280.02]  it impossible
[3280.02 --> 3280.96]  not to believe
[3280.96 --> 3281.36]  in one.
[3282.88 --> 3283.44]  Or to put it
[3283.44 --> 3283.94]  another way,
[3284.28 --> 3285.08]  the very same
[3285.08 --> 3285.92]  reason so many
[3285.92 --> 3286.70]  people miss
[3286.70 --> 3288.02]  the impossibility
[3288.02 --> 3288.70]  of Christmas
[3288.70 --> 3289.82]  is precisely
[3289.82 --> 3290.50]  the reason
[3290.50 --> 3291.84]  why you can't
[3291.84 --> 3292.82]  help but see
[3292.82 --> 3293.54]  it sitting here
[3293.54 --> 3294.06]  this morning.
[3295.00 --> 3295.42]  At least,
[3295.76 --> 3296.50]  I hope you see
[3296.50 --> 3297.62]  it or you're
[3297.62 --> 3298.32]  beginning to see
[3298.32 --> 3298.54]  it.
[3298.86 --> 3299.18]  You're getting
[3299.18 --> 3299.68]  a glimpse
[3299.68 --> 3300.88]  of it.
[3302.06 --> 3302.46]  And I know
[3302.46 --> 3302.82]  it seems
[3302.82 --> 3303.92]  convoluted
[3303.92 --> 3304.24]  perhaps.
[3304.38 --> 3305.18]  Let's try it
[3305.18 --> 3306.14]  this way.
[3308.44 --> 3309.34]  Where you
[3309.34 --> 3310.56]  start with
[3310.56 --> 3311.18]  your faith,
[3311.34 --> 3311.74]  where you
[3311.74 --> 3312.28]  are starting
[3312.28 --> 3312.86]  from,
[3313.48 --> 3313.94]  determines
[3313.94 --> 3315.28]  where you
[3315.28 --> 3315.68]  will end
[3315.68 --> 3316.00]  at.
[3317.76 --> 3317.98]  Right?
[3318.02 --> 3318.34]  If you
[3318.34 --> 3319.06]  believe in
[3319.06 --> 3319.44]  a God
[3319.44 --> 3320.00]  who says
[3320.00 --> 3320.92]  something like,
[3321.32 --> 3321.88]  with man
[3321.88 --> 3322.36]  this is
[3322.36 --> 3322.84]  impossible,
[3323.30 --> 3323.70]  but with
[3323.70 --> 3324.48]  God all
[3324.48 --> 3325.38]  things are
[3325.38 --> 3325.86]  possible.
[3326.98 --> 3327.24]  If you
[3327.24 --> 3327.56]  believe in
[3327.56 --> 3327.82]  a God
[3327.82 --> 3328.20]  who says
[3328.20 --> 3328.58]  that,
[3328.86 --> 3329.40]  then what
[3329.40 --> 3330.40]  you assume
[3330.40 --> 3331.18]  to be true
[3331.18 --> 3332.16]  will be
[3332.16 --> 3332.62]  changed,
[3332.90 --> 3333.28]  will be
[3333.28 --> 3333.78]  transformed.
[3335.22 --> 3335.64]  If you
[3335.64 --> 3336.20]  don't yet
[3336.20 --> 3336.82]  believe in
[3336.82 --> 3337.32]  this kind
[3337.32 --> 3337.78]  of God,
[3338.32 --> 3338.84]  then it
[3338.84 --> 3339.14]  remains
[3339.14 --> 3339.66]  impossible.
[3340.60 --> 3340.90]  And in
[3340.90 --> 3341.18]  a sense,
[3341.26 --> 3341.46]  you're not
[3341.46 --> 3341.72]  wrong,
[3341.80 --> 3342.56]  because for
[3342.56 --> 3342.88]  you,
[3342.96 --> 3343.62]  from your
[3343.62 --> 3344.16]  perspective,
[3345.16 --> 3345.74]  it is
[3345.74 --> 3346.62]  impossible.
[3349.02 --> 3349.38]  But,
[3349.88 --> 3351.70]  but,
[3351.76 --> 3352.32]  look at
[3352.32 --> 3353.72]  how Isaiah
[3353.72 --> 3355.00]  responds.
[3358.52 --> 3359.54]  Verse 13,
[3360.92 --> 3361.94]  Isaiah said,
[3361.94 --> 3363.10]  here,
[3363.10 --> 3363.12]  here,
[3363.52 --> 3364.06]  now,
[3364.36 --> 3364.60]  you,
[3364.86 --> 3365.78]  house of
[3365.78 --> 3366.22]  David,
[3366.36 --> 3366.86]  is it not
[3366.86 --> 3367.46]  enough to
[3367.46 --> 3367.94]  try the
[3367.94 --> 3368.46]  patience of
[3368.46 --> 3368.84]  humans?
[3369.26 --> 3369.68]  Will you
[3369.68 --> 3370.32]  try the
[3370.32 --> 3371.12]  patience of
[3371.12 --> 3371.84]  my God
[3371.84 --> 3372.54]  also?
[3373.42 --> 3373.74]  Now,
[3373.86 --> 3374.50]  don't sleep
[3374.50 --> 3375.02]  on that
[3375.02 --> 3375.62]  my God
[3375.62 --> 3376.40]  line there.
[3377.12 --> 3377.26]  Right?
[3377.36 --> 3378.02]  Isaiah is
[3378.02 --> 3379.00]  saying that
[3379.00 --> 3380.02]  God isn't
[3380.02 --> 3381.16]  Ahaz's God
[3381.16 --> 3381.70]  anymore.
[3381.92 --> 3382.52]  Ahaz has
[3382.52 --> 3383.70]  chosen something
[3383.70 --> 3384.18]  different.
[3384.32 --> 3384.86]  His face,
[3385.24 --> 3385.90]  his faith
[3385.90 --> 3387.10]  is elsewhere,
[3387.10 --> 3388.10]  and because of
[3388.10 --> 3388.24]  that,
[3388.28 --> 3388.90]  he's burying
[3388.90 --> 3389.50]  his face
[3389.50 --> 3390.30]  into the
[3390.30 --> 3390.58]  sand.
[3390.58 --> 3391.38]  He's hiding
[3391.38 --> 3392.76]  the reality
[3392.76 --> 3393.50]  of his
[3393.50 --> 3394.02]  lack of
[3394.02 --> 3394.86]  faith behind
[3394.86 --> 3395.56]  a false
[3395.56 --> 3396.20]  sense of
[3396.20 --> 3396.64]  piety.
[3398.56 --> 3398.88]  And so
[3398.88 --> 3399.32]  Isaiah
[3399.32 --> 3401.00]  says,
[3401.70 --> 3402.04]  therefore,
[3402.96 --> 3403.74]  the Lord
[3403.74 --> 3404.84]  himself will
[3404.84 --> 3405.42]  give you
[3405.42 --> 3406.20]  a sign.
[3406.74 --> 3407.40]  The virgin
[3407.40 --> 3408.30]  will conceive
[3408.30 --> 3408.88]  and give
[3408.88 --> 3409.78]  birth to a
[3409.78 --> 3410.72]  son and
[3410.72 --> 3412.12]  will call
[3412.12 --> 3412.66]  him
[3412.66 --> 3414.04]  Emmanuel.
[3418.10 --> 3419.06]  That's the
[3419.06 --> 3419.86]  impossibility
[3419.86 --> 3420.50]  of Christmas.
[3420.58 --> 3422.92]  Now,
[3422.96 --> 3423.14]  look,
[3423.20 --> 3423.56]  some of you
[3423.56 --> 3424.06]  heard me
[3424.06 --> 3424.56]  say that,
[3424.64 --> 3424.88]  and you're
[3424.88 --> 3425.18]  thinking,
[3425.32 --> 3425.50]  yep,
[3425.76 --> 3426.32]  the virgin
[3426.32 --> 3426.90]  will conceive
[3426.90 --> 3427.26]  and give
[3427.26 --> 3427.70]  birth to
[3427.70 --> 3428.08]  a son.
[3428.28 --> 3428.72]  That's
[3428.72 --> 3429.24]  impossible.
[3429.86 --> 3430.26]  And yeah,
[3430.42 --> 3430.90]  you're right,
[3431.04 --> 3431.58]  that's an
[3431.58 --> 3432.64]  impossibility
[3432.64 --> 3433.68]  in this
[3433.68 --> 3434.06]  text.
[3434.46 --> 3435.20]  We know
[3435.20 --> 3436.00]  better now,
[3436.14 --> 3436.50]  virgins
[3436.50 --> 3437.16]  don't have
[3437.16 --> 3437.92]  babies,
[3438.22 --> 3438.64]  unless,
[3438.76 --> 3439.28]  of course,
[3440.44 --> 3441.38]  unless you
[3441.38 --> 3442.24]  believe in
[3442.24 --> 3443.08]  a God who
[3443.08 --> 3443.86]  looks at the
[3443.86 --> 3444.62]  impossible and
[3444.62 --> 3444.80]  says,
[3444.90 --> 3445.16]  boom,
[3445.32 --> 3445.68]  possible.
[3446.90 --> 3447.30]  Unless,
[3447.44 --> 3447.70]  of course,
[3447.76 --> 3448.38]  you believe in
[3448.38 --> 3448.94]  a God who
[3448.94 --> 3449.98]  could create
[3449.98 --> 3450.98]  everything that
[3450.98 --> 3452.36]  you see out
[3452.36 --> 3453.12]  of nothing with
[3453.12 --> 3453.76]  just a word,
[3454.02 --> 3454.56]  a God who
[3454.56 --> 3454.80]  said,
[3455.02 --> 3455.38]  let there be
[3455.38 --> 3455.68]  light,
[3455.76 --> 3456.52]  and then bang,
[3456.68 --> 3457.28]  there's an
[3457.28 --> 3458.08]  explosion of
[3458.08 --> 3458.38]  light.
[3459.42 --> 3459.84]  And if that's
[3459.84 --> 3460.06]  what you
[3460.06 --> 3460.52]  believe,
[3460.72 --> 3461.38]  the only
[3461.38 --> 3461.94]  reasonable
[3461.94 --> 3463.06]  conclusion is
[3463.06 --> 3463.72]  that God
[3463.72 --> 3464.44]  who formed
[3464.44 --> 3465.62]  man out of
[3465.62 --> 3466.44]  dust and dirt
[3466.44 --> 3467.20]  and breathed
[3467.20 --> 3467.86]  life into
[3467.86 --> 3468.16]  them,
[3468.40 --> 3468.94]  the only
[3468.94 --> 3469.44]  reasonable
[3469.44 --> 3470.24]  conclusion that
[3470.24 --> 3470.80]  God who
[3470.80 --> 3472.20]  raised a man
[3472.20 --> 3473.00]  from the dead,
[3473.00 --> 3473.84]  the only
[3473.84 --> 3474.30]  reasonable
[3474.30 --> 3475.12]  conclusion is
[3475.12 --> 3475.60]  that God
[3475.60 --> 3476.00]  can do
[3476.00 --> 3477.02]  anything in
[3477.02 --> 3477.52]  this physical
[3477.52 --> 3477.92]  world.
[3479.20 --> 3479.38]  Right?
[3479.40 --> 3479.80]  If you have
[3479.80 --> 3480.46]  the eyes of
[3480.46 --> 3481.26]  faith to see
[3481.26 --> 3481.46]  it,
[3482.02 --> 3482.74]  it's just
[3482.74 --> 3483.92]  another evidence
[3483.92 --> 3484.92]  of God's
[3484.92 --> 3486.12]  sovereign rule
[3486.12 --> 3486.90]  that only
[3486.90 --> 3487.58]  makes sense,
[3487.86 --> 3488.38]  that speaks
[3488.38 --> 3489.76]  cogently to
[3489.76 --> 3490.30]  your heart.
[3491.66 --> 3492.50]  And if you
[3492.50 --> 3492.86]  don't,
[3494.00 --> 3494.48]  well,
[3494.50 --> 3494.68]  then it
[3494.68 --> 3495.00]  doesn't.
[3497.56 --> 3498.26]  And you
[3498.26 --> 3498.52]  need to
[3498.52 --> 3498.96]  explain it
[3498.96 --> 3499.22]  away.
[3500.82 --> 3501.66]  You need to
[3501.66 --> 3502.40]  find a reason,
[3502.84 --> 3503.08]  right,
[3503.14 --> 3503.88]  why all of
[3503.88 --> 3504.78]  these rational,
[3505.34 --> 3505.86]  reasonable,
[3506.44 --> 3506.94]  averagely
[3506.94 --> 3507.98]  intelligent people
[3507.98 --> 3509.04]  and billions
[3509.04 --> 3510.06]  throughout the
[3510.06 --> 3510.66]  world and
[3510.66 --> 3511.40]  throughout history
[3511.40 --> 3512.22]  believe this
[3512.22 --> 3512.80]  to be true.
[3514.80 --> 3515.38]  Right?
[3515.42 --> 3516.02]  When you try to
[3516.02 --> 3516.74]  explain that
[3516.74 --> 3517.12]  away,
[3517.36 --> 3518.00]  don't just
[3518.00 --> 3518.62]  bury your head
[3518.62 --> 3519.20]  in the sand
[3519.20 --> 3520.10]  and feign some
[3520.10 --> 3520.74]  sense of
[3520.74 --> 3521.52]  piety,
[3522.24 --> 3522.88]  assuming that
[3522.88 --> 3523.34]  you know
[3523.34 --> 3524.18]  best.
[3526.52 --> 3526.72]  Right?
[3526.76 --> 3527.16]  The virgin
[3527.16 --> 3528.46]  birth is
[3528.46 --> 3530.26]  an impossibility
[3530.26 --> 3531.66]  made possible
[3531.66 --> 3532.36]  at Christmas.
[3532.52 --> 3533.08]  Don't miss
[3533.08 --> 3533.42]  that.
[3533.88 --> 3534.58]  Instead,
[3535.58 --> 3536.72]  marvel at
[3536.72 --> 3536.94]  it.
[3538.16 --> 3539.28]  But that's
[3539.28 --> 3539.80]  not the
[3539.80 --> 3540.32]  impossible
[3540.32 --> 3540.92]  Christmas
[3540.92 --> 3541.68]  that I'm
[3541.68 --> 3542.22]  talking about.
[3543.60 --> 3544.52]  That's just
[3544.52 --> 3545.00]  step one.
[3546.32 --> 3547.22]  To get
[3547.22 --> 3547.40]  there,
[3547.50 --> 3548.08]  let's read
[3548.08 --> 3549.86]  Matthew 1,
[3550.20 --> 3551.36]  18 to
[3551.36 --> 3551.90]  23
[3551.90 --> 3553.06]  together.
[3555.66 --> 3556.42]  This
[3556.42 --> 3557.38]  is how
[3557.38 --> 3557.84]  the birth
[3557.84 --> 3558.40]  of Jesus,
[3558.56 --> 3559.04]  the Messiah,
[3559.18 --> 3559.64]  came about.
[3559.64 --> 3561.70]  his mother
[3561.70 --> 3562.40]  Mary was
[3562.40 --> 3563.04]  pledged to
[3563.04 --> 3563.50]  be married
[3563.50 --> 3564.12]  to Joseph,
[3564.12 --> 3565.08]  but before
[3565.08 --> 3565.66]  they came
[3565.66 --> 3566.18]  together,
[3566.58 --> 3566.94]  she was
[3566.94 --> 3567.38]  found to
[3567.38 --> 3567.86]  be pregnant
[3567.86 --> 3568.30]  through the
[3568.30 --> 3568.98]  Holy Spirit.
[3569.86 --> 3570.36]  Because
[3570.36 --> 3570.80]  Joseph,
[3570.92 --> 3571.36]  her husband,
[3571.48 --> 3572.06]  was faithful
[3572.06 --> 3572.72]  to the law
[3572.72 --> 3573.36]  and yet did
[3573.36 --> 3573.90]  not want to
[3573.90 --> 3574.72]  expose her to
[3574.72 --> 3575.60]  public disgrace,
[3575.98 --> 3576.68]  he had in
[3576.68 --> 3577.28]  mind to
[3577.28 --> 3577.92]  divorce her
[3577.92 --> 3578.34]  quietly.
[3578.34 --> 3580.30]  But after
[3580.30 --> 3580.64]  he had
[3580.64 --> 3581.02]  considered
[3581.02 --> 3581.42]  this,
[3581.50 --> 3582.00]  an angel
[3582.00 --> 3582.30]  of the
[3582.30 --> 3582.92]  Lord appeared
[3582.92 --> 3583.30]  to him
[3583.30 --> 3583.82]  in a dream
[3583.82 --> 3584.24]  and said,
[3584.38 --> 3584.70]  Joseph,
[3585.18 --> 3585.86]  son of
[3585.86 --> 3586.22]  David,
[3586.38 --> 3587.00]  do not be
[3587.00 --> 3587.66]  afraid to
[3587.66 --> 3588.20]  take Mary
[3588.20 --> 3588.76]  home as
[3588.76 --> 3589.16]  your wife,
[3589.52 --> 3590.06]  because what
[3590.06 --> 3590.72]  is conceived
[3590.72 --> 3591.86]  in her is
[3591.86 --> 3592.40]  from the
[3592.40 --> 3593.16]  Holy Spirit.
[3593.72 --> 3594.20]  She will
[3594.20 --> 3594.72]  give birth
[3594.72 --> 3595.44]  to a son
[3595.44 --> 3595.96]  and you
[3595.96 --> 3596.38]  are to
[3596.38 --> 3596.80]  give him
[3596.80 --> 3597.30]  the name
[3597.30 --> 3597.90]  Jesus,
[3597.90 --> 3598.76]  because he
[3598.76 --> 3599.42]  will save
[3599.42 --> 3600.30]  his people
[3600.30 --> 3601.00]  from all
[3601.00 --> 3602.20]  their sins.
[3602.20 --> 3603.96]  all this
[3603.96 --> 3604.68]  took place
[3604.68 --> 3605.34]  to fulfill
[3605.34 --> 3605.74]  what the
[3605.74 --> 3606.24]  Lord had
[3606.24 --> 3606.84]  said through
[3606.84 --> 3607.40]  the prophet.
[3608.30 --> 3608.82]  The virgin
[3608.82 --> 3609.62]  will conceive
[3609.62 --> 3610.22]  and give
[3610.22 --> 3611.16]  birth to
[3611.16 --> 3611.68]  a son
[3611.68 --> 3612.80]  and they
[3612.80 --> 3613.42]  will call
[3613.42 --> 3613.80]  him
[3613.80 --> 3614.90]  Emmanuel,
[3615.50 --> 3616.44]  which means
[3616.44 --> 3617.46]  God
[3617.46 --> 3619.04]  with us.
[3622.04 --> 3622.96]  This is
[3622.96 --> 3623.52]  how the
[3623.52 --> 3624.14]  birth of
[3624.14 --> 3624.82]  Jesus the
[3624.82 --> 3625.32]  Messiah
[3625.32 --> 3626.60]  came about,
[3626.70 --> 3626.84]  right?
[3626.88 --> 3627.52]  The anointed
[3627.52 --> 3628.00]  one,
[3628.36 --> 3628.94]  the servant
[3628.94 --> 3629.88]  who is king,
[3630.00 --> 3630.58]  the servant
[3630.58 --> 3631.68]  who is God's
[3631.68 --> 3632.30]  son,
[3632.46 --> 3633.12]  the servant
[3633.12 --> 3634.78]  who is God.
[3636.32 --> 3637.04]  She was
[3637.04 --> 3637.80]  found to be
[3637.80 --> 3638.88]  pregnant through
[3638.88 --> 3640.04]  the Holy Spirit.
[3640.18 --> 3640.80]  What is
[3640.80 --> 3641.76]  conceived in
[3641.76 --> 3642.86]  her is from
[3642.86 --> 3643.94]  the Holy Spirit.
[3644.24 --> 3644.58]  God,
[3644.64 --> 3645.56]  God the Spirit
[3645.56 --> 3646.74]  causes Mary
[3646.74 --> 3647.98]  to be with
[3647.98 --> 3648.60]  child.
[3648.78 --> 3649.58]  God is
[3649.58 --> 3650.78]  his father.
[3650.94 --> 3651.50]  This ain't
[3651.50 --> 3652.30]  no ordinary
[3652.30 --> 3652.88]  son.
[3653.14 --> 3654.06]  Don't miss
[3654.06 --> 3654.42]  that.
[3655.56 --> 3656.10]  She will
[3656.10 --> 3656.58]  give birth
[3656.58 --> 3657.26]  to a son
[3657.26 --> 3657.82]  and you are
[3657.82 --> 3658.36]  to give him
[3658.36 --> 3658.78]  the name
[3658.78 --> 3659.46]  Jesus,
[3659.64 --> 3660.06]  because he
[3660.06 --> 3660.60]  will save
[3660.60 --> 3661.14]  his people
[3661.14 --> 3661.60]  from their
[3661.60 --> 3662.00]  sins.
[3662.48 --> 3663.06]  Jesus,
[3663.38 --> 3663.88]  Yeshua,
[3664.30 --> 3665.18]  means the
[3665.18 --> 3666.14]  Lord saves.
[3667.68 --> 3668.14]  And all
[3668.14 --> 3668.52]  of this
[3668.52 --> 3669.12]  took place
[3669.12 --> 3669.68]  to fulfill
[3669.68 --> 3670.04]  what the
[3670.04 --> 3670.46]  Lord had
[3670.46 --> 3670.88]  said through
[3670.88 --> 3671.36]  the prophet.
[3672.10 --> 3672.66]  The virgin
[3672.66 --> 3673.34]  will conceive
[3673.34 --> 3673.86]  and give
[3673.86 --> 3674.38]  birth to
[3674.38 --> 3674.90]  a son
[3674.90 --> 3675.68]  and they
[3675.68 --> 3676.26]  will call
[3676.26 --> 3676.54]  him
[3676.54 --> 3677.26]  Emmanuel,
[3677.76 --> 3678.48]  which means
[3678.48 --> 3679.16]  God
[3679.16 --> 3680.70]  with us.
[3681.98 --> 3682.58]  God
[3682.58 --> 3683.54]  with
[3683.54 --> 3684.74]  us.
[3685.92 --> 3686.56]  That
[3686.56 --> 3687.48]  is the
[3687.48 --> 3688.50]  impossibility
[3688.50 --> 3689.70]  of Christmas.
[3689.70 --> 3690.56]  God
[3690.56 --> 3691.62]  with us.
[3692.28 --> 3693.20]  The eternal
[3693.20 --> 3693.88]  enters
[3693.88 --> 3694.42]  time.
[3695.82 --> 3696.46]  The infinite
[3696.46 --> 3697.52]  limits himself
[3697.52 --> 3698.30]  into the
[3698.30 --> 3698.68]  finite.
[3699.06 --> 3699.98]  The transcendent
[3699.98 --> 3700.84]  condescends
[3700.84 --> 3701.52]  and becomes
[3701.52 --> 3702.14]  imminent.
[3702.52 --> 3702.74]  In the
[3702.74 --> 3703.16]  Christ
[3703.16 --> 3703.64]  child,
[3703.76 --> 3704.30]  the fullness
[3704.30 --> 3705.48]  of God
[3705.48 --> 3706.40]  dwells.
[3707.48 --> 3707.84]  Oh man,
[3707.94 --> 3708.44]  don't be
[3708.44 --> 3708.98]  numb
[3708.98 --> 3709.78]  to this
[3709.78 --> 3710.30]  miracle
[3710.30 --> 3711.04]  or take
[3711.04 --> 3711.60]  for granted
[3711.60 --> 3712.48]  the majesty
[3712.48 --> 3713.14]  of this
[3713.14 --> 3713.82]  mystery.
[3713.96 --> 3714.32]  This is
[3714.32 --> 3714.70]  Christmas.
[3714.70 --> 3716.70]  right?
[3716.76 --> 3716.94]  And you
[3716.94 --> 3717.58]  can choose
[3717.58 --> 3718.06]  to bury
[3718.06 --> 3718.46]  your head
[3718.46 --> 3718.78]  in the
[3718.78 --> 3719.08]  sand
[3719.08 --> 3719.60]  and explain
[3719.60 --> 3719.96]  it away.
[3721.16 --> 3721.60]  But
[3721.60 --> 3721.92]  instead,
[3723.02 --> 3724.74]  instead I
[3724.74 --> 3725.22]  hope you
[3725.22 --> 3725.94]  begin to
[3725.94 --> 3726.40]  wonder.
[3727.48 --> 3727.80]  And I
[3727.80 --> 3728.18]  pray,
[3728.28 --> 3728.72]  I pray
[3728.72 --> 3729.08]  that your
[3729.08 --> 3729.58]  wonder
[3729.58 --> 3731.16]  turns to
[3731.16 --> 3731.60]  worship
[3731.60 --> 3732.76]  as you
[3732.76 --> 3733.28]  approach
[3733.28 --> 3733.68]  this
[3733.68 --> 3734.48]  Christ
[3734.48 --> 3734.82]  child.
[3735.72 --> 3736.18]  Don't be
[3736.18 --> 3736.74]  distracted
[3736.74 --> 3737.28]  by the
[3737.28 --> 3737.76]  busyness
[3737.76 --> 3738.12]  of the
[3738.12 --> 3738.50]  season
[3738.50 --> 3738.86]  around.
[3739.32 --> 3739.98]  Don't let
[3739.98 --> 3740.34]  what is
[3740.34 --> 3740.78]  right in
[3740.78 --> 3741.28]  front of
[3741.28 --> 3742.26]  you rob
[3742.26 --> 3743.28]  you of
[3743.28 --> 3743.98]  the God
[3743.98 --> 3744.30]  who's
[3744.30 --> 3744.60]  all
[3744.60 --> 3745.06]  around
[3745.06 --> 3745.30]  you,
[3745.40 --> 3745.84]  the God
[3745.84 --> 3746.48]  who came
[3746.48 --> 3747.40]  into the
[3747.40 --> 3747.88]  world to
[3747.88 --> 3748.34]  live the
[3748.34 --> 3748.74]  life I
[3748.74 --> 3749.04]  should have
[3749.04 --> 3749.38]  lived and
[3749.38 --> 3750.08]  who died
[3750.08 --> 3750.54]  the death
[3750.54 --> 3750.96]  that I
[3750.96 --> 3751.74]  deserved.
[3752.28 --> 3753.02]  That's the
[3753.02 --> 3753.86]  impossibility
[3753.86 --> 3754.54]  of Christmas
[3754.54 --> 3755.52]  made possible
[3755.52 --> 3756.84]  by Emmanuel,
[3757.24 --> 3758.20]  God with
[3758.20 --> 3758.68]  us.
[3759.08 --> 3759.74]  And seeing
[3759.74 --> 3760.36]  the world
[3760.36 --> 3761.00]  in this
[3761.00 --> 3761.92]  way changes
[3761.92 --> 3762.86]  everything
[3762.86 --> 3764.24]  about the
[3764.24 --> 3764.56]  world.
[3767.06 --> 3768.22]  So now,
[3769.00 --> 3769.58]  no matter
[3769.58 --> 3770.48]  what you
[3770.48 --> 3771.80]  are facing,
[3772.92 --> 3773.40]  no matter
[3773.40 --> 3774.42]  how deep
[3774.42 --> 3775.54]  the darkness
[3775.54 --> 3776.18]  and the
[3776.18 --> 3776.80]  depths of
[3776.80 --> 3777.40]  despair
[3777.40 --> 3778.86]  might feel,
[3780.48 --> 3782.56]  God is
[3782.56 --> 3784.38]  with us.
[3785.42 --> 3786.40]  No matter
[3786.40 --> 3787.52]  how impossible
[3787.52 --> 3788.88]  your circumstance
[3788.88 --> 3790.20]  might seem,
[3790.38 --> 3791.36]  God is
[3791.36 --> 3792.38]  with us.
[3792.96 --> 3793.44]  No matter
[3793.44 --> 3794.06]  how great
[3794.06 --> 3795.08]  or successful
[3795.08 --> 3796.06]  you think
[3796.06 --> 3796.84]  yourself to
[3796.84 --> 3797.48]  have been
[3797.48 --> 3798.18]  and become,
[3798.52 --> 3799.34]  God is
[3799.34 --> 3800.28]  with us
[3800.28 --> 3800.64]  and it's
[3800.64 --> 3801.28]  from him
[3801.28 --> 3801.62]  and him
[3801.62 --> 3802.06]  alone
[3802.06 --> 3802.86]  that all
[3802.86 --> 3803.70]  good gifts
[3803.70 --> 3804.26]  come.
[3806.86 --> 3807.90]  And all
[3807.90 --> 3808.60]  of this,
[3809.44 --> 3811.00]  all of
[3811.00 --> 3811.52]  this
[3811.52 --> 3812.84]  comes
[3812.84 --> 3814.24]  with the
[3814.24 --> 3814.86]  eyes of
[3814.86 --> 3815.24]  faith
[3815.24 --> 3816.66]  to see it.
[3818.30 --> 3819.22]  I pray
[3819.22 --> 3819.62]  that this
[3819.62 --> 3820.04]  Christmas
[3820.04 --> 3821.84]  you share
[3821.84 --> 3822.60]  those eyes
[3822.60 --> 3823.80]  of faith
[3823.80 --> 3824.96]  with me.
[3824.96 --> 3827.86]  and so
[3827.86 --> 3828.62]  this
[3828.62 --> 3829.22]  Christmas
[3829.22 --> 3830.70]  marveling
[3830.70 --> 3830.96]  at the
[3830.96 --> 3831.38]  majesty
[3831.38 --> 3832.12]  of God
[3832.12 --> 3833.22]  with us,
[3833.52 --> 3834.22]  all of
[3834.22 --> 3835.02]  those gathered
[3835.02 --> 3835.76]  here who
[3835.76 --> 3836.56]  have these
[3836.56 --> 3837.30]  eyes of
[3837.30 --> 3837.66]  faith
[3837.66 --> 3838.46]  together
[3838.46 --> 3839.06]  said,
[3840.14 --> 3840.44]  amen.
[3841.44 --> 3842.02]  Let's
[3842.02 --> 3842.22]  pray.
[3842.22 --> 3848.78]  Lord
[3848.78 --> 3850.12]  Jesus
[3850.12 --> 3851.50]  Christ,
[3853.72 --> 3854.30]  Yeshua
[3854.30 --> 3855.64]  Messiah,
[3856.26 --> 3856.62]  Jesus
[3856.62 --> 3858.04]  Messiah,
[3861.38 --> 3861.86]  Jesus
[3861.86 --> 3863.56]  Christos,
[3865.50 --> 3865.94]  you
[3865.94 --> 3866.62]  are
[3866.62 --> 3867.28]  God
[3867.28 --> 3868.58]  with us,
[3868.58 --> 3869.24]  Emmanuel.
[3869.24 --> 3873.64]  may this
[3873.64 --> 3874.56]  truth
[3874.56 --> 3875.88]  transform
[3875.88 --> 3876.90]  how we
[3876.90 --> 3877.56]  see
[3877.56 --> 3878.46]  the world.
[3880.84 --> 3881.66]  Give
[3881.66 --> 3882.20]  us
[3882.20 --> 3882.80]  today
[3882.80 --> 3883.40]  these
[3883.40 --> 3884.04]  eyes
[3884.04 --> 3885.12]  of faith
[3885.12 --> 3885.88]  that in
[3885.88 --> 3886.32]  you,
[3886.60 --> 3887.34]  from you,
[3887.42 --> 3888.02]  and with
[3888.02 --> 3888.38]  you,
[3888.54 --> 3889.24]  we might
[3889.24 --> 3889.88]  see
[3889.88 --> 3890.66]  you.
[3892.98 --> 3894.14]  Draw us
[3894.14 --> 3894.50]  near
[3894.50 --> 3895.38]  to you,
[3895.58 --> 3896.14]  we pray
[3896.14 --> 3896.94]  today,
[3896.94 --> 3899.06]  that we
[3899.06 --> 3899.32]  might
[3899.32 --> 3899.78]  marvel
[3899.78 --> 3900.64]  at the
[3900.64 --> 3901.12]  mystery
[3901.12 --> 3902.20]  of the
[3902.20 --> 3902.80]  incarnation.
[3903.84 --> 3904.32]  In
[3904.32 --> 3904.62]  Jesus'
[3904.80 --> 3905.20]  name we
[3905.20 --> 3905.50]  pray.
[3906.36 --> 3906.80]  Amen.
[3907.82 --> 3908.22]  Amen.
[3908.22 --> 3908.28]  Amen.
[3918.34 --> 3918.60]  Amen.
[3918.60 --> 3919.26]  Amen.
[3919.26 --> 3919.38]  Amen.
[3919.38 --> 3919.76]  Amen.
[3919.76 --> 3919.86]  Amen.
