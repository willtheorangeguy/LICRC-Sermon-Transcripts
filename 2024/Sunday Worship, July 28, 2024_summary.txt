• Peter and John heal a lame man in the name of Jesus Christ
• The apostles are challenged by temple officials about their authority
• Peter gives a speech defending his actions, stating that healing was done through Jesus' name
• The rulers and elders question the apostles but can't deny the miracle
• They command Peter and John to stop preaching in Jesus' name
• Peter and John refuse, citing that they cannot help speaking about what they've seen and heard
• The rulers release them after further threats due to public pressure
• The disciples face potential persecution for their actions, but continue to boldly proclaim the gospel.
• Jesus commands his disciples to listen to him and obey everything he has commanded
• The command to obey is rooted in a moral obligation to God, but also comes with a cost as they will face opposition and persecution
• Disciples are willing to pay this price and choose obedience despite the risks
• In modern times, Christians may face government restrictions or persecution for sharing the gospel or calling for conversion
• The desire to obey is fueled by a deeper commitment to worshiping and magnifying Jesus
• The miraculous healing of a lame man from birth through faith in Jesus' name
• Peter explains the healing as the result of Jesus' name and the faith that comes through him
• The Holy Spirit's power and Jesus' name are the keys to understanding the healing
• The act of proclaiming Jesus' name is an expression of worship and magnification of His glories
• Human nature tends to proclaim and share amazing things, especially when they believe them to be magnificent
• The importance of magnifying or proclaiming something that is magnificent and miraculous
• The resurrection of Jesus as a miraculous reason for boldly proclaiming the gospel
• The experience of being touched by God in worship or seeing an unexpected answer to prayer
• Sharing personal stories of transformation and changed lives
• The mercy reason: salvation through no other name but Jesus Christ
• The Son of God is necessary for eternal life
• Jesus is the only way to the Father and salvation
• Exclusivity is inherent in any truth or claim
• The Bible teaches that salvation comes through faith in Christ, not through other means or methods
• The message of Christ's exclusivity is often misunderstood as arrogant, but it is simply a statement of fact based on God's Word
• Polycarp, the bishop of Smyrna, is arrested by Roman soldiers
• He welcomes his arrest calmly and asks for time to pray before going with them willingly
• At his trial, Quintus, the proconsul, urges him to renounce his faith and swear by Caesar's fortune to save his life
• Polycarp refuses to renounce his faith and responds that he has served Christ for 86 years and cannot blaspheme his king and savior
• He steadfastly refuses to renounce his faith despite being urged by Quintus
• Polycarp is being pressured by the proconsul to abandon his faith
• Polycarp remains unshaken and says the fire of judgment will be eternal for the ungodly, not temporary as threatened
• The crowd demands Polycarp be burned alive
• Polycarp prays while being lit on fire and miraculously is not harmed by it
• A Roman guard eventually kills Polycarp with a sword
• This story is used to illustrate the legacy of faith and the continued cost of proclaiming one's Christian beliefs
• A modern example of this is Pastor Andrew Bunsen, who was arrested in Turkey in 2016 on espionage and terrorism charges for his Christian beliefs
• The story of John Chow, a missionary who attempted to evangelize the Sentinelese people on North Sentinel Island
• Contrast between the two main interpretations: Chow as a colonizer or as someone faithful to God's call to preach the gospel
• Discussion of whether mercy, magnify, and moral reasons for not preaching are legitimate
• The importance of proclaiming Jesus Christ as the only name by which men must be saved
• Command from God to make disciples and teach others to obey in Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth (including remote islands)
• The importance of proclaiming the gospel
• Being bold in sharing one's faith, even with those who disagree or mock
