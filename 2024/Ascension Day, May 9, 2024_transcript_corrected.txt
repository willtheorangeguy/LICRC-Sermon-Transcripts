[0.00 → 8.60] In my opinion, the day of the day, the sun will be me, and I'm just going to be me.
[8.60 → 14.20] You know what, then I would suggest you go back there. I will never go back.
[14.80 → 15.86] You said it for a while.
[15.86 → 17.60] I'm sure that I'm going to go back.
[19.74 → 22.54] The truth you get, some people are going to be everywhere.
[22.54 → 25.52] You're sucking the bass every month I read in the book.
[25.52 → 26.76] It's right. You're not a friend.
[26.92 → 27.66] It's a total thing.
[27.66 → 28.80] I'm just paying thanks for everything.
[28.80 → 30.80] In my opinion, the other person was
[30.80 → 32.12] executive secretary is on top of the board.
[32.12 → 33.96] So if I let the horn out, we'll end up here.
[33.96 → 34.66] I need a memory.

[36.72 → 38.10] No pictures of their heads.
[38.10 → 40.10] It broke me, so I don't believe it.
[40.10 → 41.02] It's a beautiful north.
[41.02 → 43.22] To it…
[48.58 → 49.80] Thank you and everyone.
[49.80 → 52.46] When you're in Example,

[55.18 → 56.58] 복 years to help.
[56.58 → 58.58] Is that what it looks like?
[58.58 → 60.58] It's a bird cloud.
[60.58 → 62.58] Yeah, you can see it.
[62.58 → 64.58] Oh, there's one hiding.
[64.58 → 66.58] Oh, yeah, there's one hiding.

[118.58 → 120.58] .
[120.58 → 122.58] They used it.
[122.58 → 124.58] .
[124.58 → 126.58] Yeah, I'm just getting.
[126.58 → 156.56] Thank you.
[156.58 → 186.56] Thank you.
[186.58 → 216.56] Thank you.
[216.58 → 218.58] Thank you.
[246.58 → 248.58] Thank you.
[276.58 → 278.58] Thank you.
[306.58 → 308.58] Thank you.
[336.58 → 338.58] Thank you.
[366.58 → 368.58] Thank you.
[396.58 → 398.58] Thank you.
[426.58 → 428.58] Thank you.
[456.58 → 458.58] Thank you.
[486.58 → 488.58] Thank you.
[488.58 → 490.58] Thank you.
[490.58 → 492.58] Thank you.
[492.58 → 522.56] Thank you.
[522.58 → 552.56] Thank you.
[552.58 → 582.56] Thank you.
[582.58 → 584.58] Thank you.
[584.58 → 588.80] and also welcome if you are joining us online.
[589.94 → 593.30] Tonight, as I trust you've seen, our format is a little bit different.
[594.44 → 597.40] It's always interesting to me that when you make changes,
[597.62 → 600.68] old habits die hard and the first people here sit in the back.
[601.80 → 603.06] Yeah, mom and dad, that was you.
[605.70 → 609.48] So the reason we wanted to gather in this more intimate way,
[609.80 → 612.44] in part is because we knew there would be fewer of us here,
[612.44 → 622.96] but also because we wanted to try and live into our rehearsing of the story of Ascension differently.
[623.40 → 626.06] And so we're unplugging our worship.
[626.42 → 630.38] There's no amplification for any of the musicians, just your voices.
[630.84 → 633.26] Your voices are the amplification.
[634.28 → 637.88] And so Karis, I'm requiring you to sing extra loud tonight.
[639.78 → 641.54] And we have no screen.
[641.54 → 645.42] And so we're going to move through the liturgy in the book that you have,
[645.54 → 647.22] and it's going to go page by page.
[647.94 → 652.48] And so if you didn't get one, there's many more available at the back.
[653.16 → 655.64] So go ahead and grab one of those.
[657.24 → 659.82] And then as we go, we will move.
[660.98 → 664.78] Pretty much the only announcement will be turning your page.
[664.78 → 671.60] And so follow along as we go in our worship this evening together.
[672.10 → 673.76] I'm going to invite you to stand.
[674.40 → 678.42] And we're going to begin our worship with a communal call.
[680.06 → 684.86] Following the call, I will welcome us in God's name.
[684.86 → 692.32] As mentioned, we are rehearsing together the story of the Ascension of Jesus.
[692.50 → 697.78] And so we start as our call with the story of the Ascension,
[698.22 → 700.48] recorded by Luke in the book of Acts.
[700.48 → 730.46] And after he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes,
[730.48 → 733.74] and a cloud hid him from their sight.
[735.06 → 737.52] Receive the greeting of our God.
[738.84 → 745.52] Grace and peace to you from him who is and who was and who is to come,
[745.88 → 748.26] and from the seven spirits before his throne,
[748.40 → 751.34] and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness,
[751.52 → 755.72] the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth.
[756.16 → 758.38] And all God's people said, amen.
[758.38 → 762.62] I invite you to welcome those around you in worship by saying,
[762.70 → 766.06] the Lord be with you, and then respond with and also with you.
[766.06 → 781.28] I'll just go let you say it first.

[1002.54 → 1007.94] Jesus, our Saviour, tonight as we celebrate your Ascension to heaven where you are seated
[1007.94 → 1014.94] in all your glory on the throne of thrones, advocating on our behalf to our Heavenly Father,
[1014.94 → 1017.94] we can do nothing but give you glory.
[1017.94 → 1024.30] May we be affirmed tonight that we are your people and that one day we will be with you
[1024.30 → 1026.30] as co-heirs to all your kingdom.
[1026.30 → 1032.10] Christ, our King, send your Spirit here tonight to be with us and press on our hearts the things
[1032.10 → 1035.30] that are not of this world but are of your kingdom.
[1035.30 → 1038.30] Draw us closer to you, Christ, our King.
[1038.30 → 1039.30] We pray.

[1084.06 → 1099.06] Bring forth the royal diadem and crown him Lord of all.

[1364.14 → 1368.14] King of kings, who is crowned in glory, we praise Your name.
[1368.14 → 1373.14] So often, though, Lord, we put other things ahead of You.
[1373.14 → 1380.14] We worship idols of our own making, Of our own following, of our own desiring.
[1380.14 → 1385.14] As we humbly come before You, Lord, we pray for forgiveness.
[1385.14 → 1390.14] May we come to know and serve and love You more, Lord Jesus our King.

[1476.14 → 1487.14] I want to be like You, Jesus, To have this heart in me.
[1487.14 → 1500.14] You are the God of the humble, You are the humble King.
[1500.14 → 1512.14] O kneel me down again, Here at Your feet.
[1512.14 → 1523.14] Show me how much You love, Humility.

[1632.32 → 1637.24] I've got nothing new
[1637.24 → 1640.64] How could I express
[1640.64 → 1645.04] All my gratitude
[1645.04 → 1650.64] I could sing these songs
[1650.64 → 1654.64] As I often do
[1654.64 → 1659.84] Every song I stand
[1659.84 → 1664.24] And you never hear
[1664.24 → 1668.42] So I throw up my hands
[1668.42 → 1670.52] Praise you again
[1670.52 → 1675.42] All that I have is
[1675.42 → 1679.70] Alleluia
[1679.70 → 1683.94] Alleluia
[1683.94 → 1686.18] And the noise of us

[1687.90 → 1689.14] We've got nothing new
[1689.14 → 1692.82] Stand for our hearts
[1692.82 → 1693.54] Singing
[1693.54 → 1697.54] Alleluia
[1697.54 → 1702.74] Alleluia
[1702.74 → 1709.94] I've got one response
[1709.94 → 1713.46] I've got just one proof
[1713.46 → 1717.94] With my arms stretched wide
[1717.94 → 1722.42] I will worship you
[1722.42 → 1725.66] So I throw up my hands
[1725.66 → 1729.90] Praise you again and again
[1729.90 → 1733.14] So I throw up my hands
[1733.14 → 1737.36] Alleluia

[1743.16 → 1743.78] I know it's not flashed
[1743.78 → 1744.10] I know it's notes
[1744.10 → 1746.18] I know it's Dock
[1746.18 → 1746.96] Can I possibly ask for a key
[1746.96 → 1750.26] Step for our hearts
[1750.26 → 1750.38] Singing
[1750.38 → 1752.38] in

[1824.38 → 1826.38] so I've brought my hands
[1826.38 → 1830.38] and praised you again and again
[1830.38 → 1834.38] cause all that I have is a
[1834.38 → 1836.38] hallelujah
[1836.38 → 1840.38] hallelujah
[1840.38 → 1844.38] and I know it's not much
[1844.38 → 1846.38] but I'm nothing else
[1846.38 → 1848.38] before me
[1848.38 → 1852.38] except for a heart singing
[1852.38 → 1854.38] hallelujah
[1854.38 → 1858.38] hallelujah
[1858.38 → 1860.38] hallelujah

[1876.38 → 1891.94] Jesus, you are our king.
[1893.76 → 1897.00] And so with humble hearts, we offer you all that we can.
[1897.00 → 1902.76] And maybe right now, all that that is, is hallelujah.
[1906.38 → 1920.36] Maybe right now, all that that is, is our presence here with you.
[1924.86 → 1935.78] Maybe right now, all that that is, is a crying heart longing to see more of you.
[1936.38 → 1942.70] So as we come to your word, may we hear your voice.
[1943.90 → 1949.54] As we come to these eternal truths, may we see in them your face.
[1949.54 → 1961.22] And as we reflect on the story of your ascension, as we reflect on the truth of your kingship,
[1963.06 → 1967.88] may our hearts be stirred to give you a more profound hallelujah.
[1968.82 → 1975.56] May our hearts be stirred to give you greater and more comprehensive praise in all that we do.
[1975.56 → 1984.16] May our hearts be stirred that our tears of sorrow might be turned to tears of joy.
[1985.12 → 1991.20] Because tonight we see you, Lord Jesus, on the throne of your grace as king.
[1991.20 → 2000.74] Speak now, we pray, Lord Jesus, directly to our hearts.
[2002.30 → 2007.70] That it might be applicable directly to our lives.
[2008.58 → 2010.16] In your name we pray.
[2011.06 → 2011.44] Amen.
[2011.44 → 2011.54] Amen.
[2011.54 → 2024.14] I don't know if you remember Easter or Palm Sunday or Good Friday, in between those two.
[2024.74 → 2030.56] But when we were here, every one of those services, we were looking at the story of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew.
[2030.56 → 2034.74] And we said that we were rehearsing the narrative.
[2035.50 → 2038.64] We were rehearsing the truths of Palm Sunday.
[2038.86 → 2043.84] And so when crowds of people walked with palm branches in our midst, they lived that out.
[2044.36 → 2051.76] On Good Friday, when we came, and we spent time in silence and in that dark night of the soul in worship,
[2051.76 → 2056.50] we were rehearsing those who cried out at the death of Jesus.
[2056.50 → 2063.98] And on Easter Sunday, when we came, hundreds upon hundreds of voices joyfully singing praise to the Lord,
[2064.04 → 2068.42] we were shouting the empty tomb like those first disciples did.
[2070.02 → 2076.96] And tonight, we continue that act of rehearsing in our worship and for our worship
[2076.96 → 2082.38] in the themes and ideas of the ascension of Jesus.
[2082.38 → 2098.18] Now, Ascension Day in the Christian church isn't new, but very clearly, it's not as popular as Easter.
[2099.44 → 2102.08] It's not as well attended as Good Friday.
[2102.94 → 2105.80] And maybe it pales in comparison to Christmas.
[2106.94 → 2108.32] But why is that?
[2108.92 → 2111.76] And more importantly, should it?
[2112.38 → 2125.50] The Reformed Church has always held up Ascension Day as the day.
[2126.18 → 2131.10] On par, maybe even greater than Easter itself.
[2132.58 → 2138.16] What I want to do is just going to give you a quick little history of theology for a few seconds.
[2138.16 → 2142.38] But the reason I do that is because I'm going to quote from a few people here.
[2142.48 → 2148.96] But as I do that, please note that I get further and further back in history with these people that I talk about.
[2150.16 → 2155.16] And so, the first is a theologian named Herman Back.
[2155.84 → 2158.64] He's a Dutch theologian in the late 19th century.
[2158.64 → 2160.64] And he said,
[2160.64 → 2178.34] And that idea of the humiliation of Jesus, the condescending of Jesus, the coming down in the incarnation,
[2178.70 → 2184.02] and his learning obedience, and his death on the cross being the road to his exaltation,
[2184.02 → 2188.26] is the theme that's going to run right through everything you hear from me tonight.
[2189.70 → 2197.02] Let's jump back 400 years before Herman Back to a theologian named John Calvin,
[2197.82 → 2202.38] a Frenchman who lived and pastored in Geneva at the time of the Reformation.
[2202.38 → 2211.60] He says that our redemption was fully complete and finished then when Christ did ascend unto his Father.
[2215.02 → 2222.58] Without the ascension, our redemption, according to Calvin at least, is not yet fully complete and finished.
[2224.04 → 2229.10] And Calvin actually, he goes on in quite a voluminous manner to give us three reasons
[2229.10 → 2235.82] why the ascension of Jesus is vital for our Christian faith and for our life together.
[2236.48 → 2238.98] He says in his Institutes,
[2239.10 → 2241.24] Having entered the temple not made with hands,
[2241.34 → 2246.34] he constantly appears as our advocate and intercessor in the presence of the Father.
[2247.32 → 2251.74] So, if Jesus did not leave, we would not have a constant intercessor,
[2252.22 → 2253.38] like the book of Hebrews says.
[2253.38 → 2254.38] Right?
[2255.18 → 2260.80] We have a constant advocate in the presence of God our Father.
[2261.88 → 2262.06] Right?
[2262.08 → 2265.30] That the wrath of God for my sin is turned away
[2265.30 → 2270.18] because Jesus, right now in heaven, is standing front of the Father saying,
[2270.58 → 2272.18] Don't look at him, look at me.
[2273.36 → 2275.56] See me when you see her.
[2276.70 → 2279.96] See me and my perfection when you see his sin.
[2280.86 → 2282.26] That's what Jesus is doing.
[2283.38 → 2286.30] On your behalf, in front of the Father,
[2287.10 → 2289.66] with you on his mind and you in his heart,
[2290.64 → 2293.64] saying, Look at my perfection,
[2294.40 → 2296.78] not at their sin.
[2297.92 → 2299.14] Calvin goes on, and he says,
[2299.56 → 2303.26] By his ascension, Jesus opened up access to the heavenly kingdom,
[2303.78 → 2305.14] which Adam had shut.
[2306.12 → 2308.34] And what Calvin means there, as he goes on to explain,
[2308.34 → 2313.10] is that Jesus is in heaven as a man.
[2313.60 → 2313.86] Right?
[2313.94 → 2314.96] As a human.
[2315.24 → 2316.16] Fully human.
[2316.16 → 2316.70] Right?
[2316.78 → 2320.38] We, as humans, people here and now on this earth and in this life,
[2320.74 → 2323.02] don't only have the hope of heaven,
[2323.18 → 2327.62] but in some way, part of us is already in heaven.
[2327.94 → 2330.66] Because if we belong to Jesus, we are part of his body.
[2330.66 → 2334.22] And as you know, Jesus is the head of the body.
[2334.38 → 2338.12] And so already now, your head is in heaven.
[2339.30 → 2344.72] Already now, a piece of who you are is in heaven.
[2344.72 → 2350.00] Without the ascension, that doesn't happen.
[2351.16 → 2352.30] That's not possible.
[2353.80 → 2357.30] Calvin goes on to say, he paraphrases Ephesians 4,
[2357.66 → 2358.02] he says,
[2358.22 → 2361.50] When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive.
[2362.48 → 2364.24] And I love that phrase.
[2364.34 → 2366.36] He led captivity captive.
[2366.80 → 2367.00] Right?
[2367.08 → 2368.74] Because Christ has ascended,
[2369.24 → 2370.72] we have been redeemed,
[2370.72 → 2375.70] and death has been given victory over,
[2375.70 → 2378.16] and he, by the Holy Spirit,
[2378.30 → 2380.38] now makes us alive.
[2381.64 → 2386.16] And so captivity, our slavery and deathliness in sin,
[2386.52 → 2389.70] has been made captive, has been killed.
[2389.92 → 2393.02] Death is dead because Jesus ascended.
[2393.26 → 2395.28] The Spirit is able to come,
[2395.36 → 2397.50] and we are made alive.
[2397.50 → 2400.98] Jesus himself says,
[2401.72 → 2405.24] Unless I go, I cannot send the Spirit.
[2406.36 → 2407.66] So your faith,
[2408.22 → 2410.36] any modicum of faith that you have
[2410.36 → 2412.00] as a gift from God
[2412.00 → 2414.34] is granted to you by the Holy Spirit
[2414.34 → 2418.04] that came precisely and only because
[2418.04 → 2420.76] Jesus was ascended.
[2420.76 → 2425.84] This actually perfectly paraphrases
[2425.84 → 2428.60] the teaching of the Heidelberg Catechism.
[2429.12 → 2430.74] And so when Kevin prayed earlier,
[2430.86 → 2432.06] you saw it in your booklets.
[2432.72 → 2435.32] Heidelberg Catechism question and answer 49
[2435.32 → 2440.48] says that the reason the ascension benefits us
[2440.48 → 2443.20] is because we have an advocate in heaven
[2443.20 → 2444.44] in the presence of our Father.
[2445.44 → 2446.78] It's exactly what Calvin taught.
[2447.42 → 2449.32] Second, we have our own flesh in heaven
[2449.32 → 2451.30] as a sure pledge that Christ, our head,
[2451.38 → 2454.04] will also take us, his members, up to himself.
[2454.34 → 2456.78] And third, he sends his Spirit to us on earth
[2456.78 → 2458.16] as a corresponding pledge.
[2458.52 → 2460.30] By the Spirit's power,
[2460.46 → 2461.96] we seek not earthly things,
[2462.24 → 2463.20] but the things above,
[2463.32 → 2464.38] where Christ is,
[2464.82 → 2466.70] seated at the right hand of God.
[2466.70 → 2474.98] Now, go a thousand years further back in history,
[2475.66 → 2477.52] into the fifth century,
[2478.04 → 2481.08] and you have a church father by the name of Augustine.
[2481.66 → 2483.94] Augustine is a church father from North Africa.
[2484.92 → 2486.50] He's named Bishop of Hippo,
[2486.92 → 2489.58] which is near the Mediterranean coast,
[2489.68 → 2492.88] a little bit west of Alexandria or Egypt.
[2492.88 → 2500.06] Augustine, in a sermon on Ascension Day,
[2500.14 → 2501.90] in one of his Ascension Day sermons,
[2502.08 → 2502.38] said,
[2502.76 → 2504.70] He, while he is there,
[2504.84 → 2506.06] is also with us,
[2506.14 → 2507.76] and we, while we are here,
[2508.16 → 2509.68] are also with him.
[2510.72 → 2513.10] And again, that's that beautiful exchange.
[2513.94 → 2515.88] That Jesus, though he is there,
[2515.98 → 2517.62] is here with us by the Spirit,
[2517.62 → 2519.82] and that we, though we are here,
[2520.14 → 2520.86] are with him,
[2521.00 → 2522.56] because as our head,
[2522.92 → 2525.44] he gathers us up into himself
[2525.44 → 2530.28] and brings us into the heavenly places.
[2532.38 → 2535.70] And go back even 500 years before that,
[2536.38 → 2538.34] and Jesus himself says,
[2538.88 → 2540.62] I must go.
[2541.14 → 2543.24] It is for your good, he says,
[2543.44 → 2544.38] that I go.
[2547.62 → 2550.64] So we've gone all the way back to Jesus.
[2551.94 → 2553.24] In preparing for this,
[2553.38 → 2556.00] I spent a little while
[2556.00 → 2557.74] digging through sermons
[2557.74 → 2560.62] from the third century on Ascension Day.
[2561.66 → 2563.04] And the reason I do that,
[2563.08 → 2564.54] and the reason I name that here,
[2565.10 → 2566.72] is because that means
[2566.72 → 2570.16] for at least 1,800 years,
[2571.00 → 2572.16] the Christian church
[2572.16 → 2574.16] has been gathering on this day,
[2574.16 → 2576.20] marking this truth
[2576.20 → 2577.92] of who Jesus is.
[2579.44 → 2580.90] What we do here
[2580.90 → 2582.18] is no small thing.
[2583.38 → 2584.60] What we do here
[2584.60 → 2585.58] is participating
[2585.58 → 2587.84] in the line of faith
[2587.84 → 2589.18] that has come before us,
[2589.26 → 2590.38] that great cloud of witnesses,
[2590.74 → 2592.48] and standing on that
[2592.48 → 2594.66] practice and truth.
[2596.02 → 2597.32] What we do here
[2597.32 → 2598.92] is not only rehearse
[2598.92 → 2600.66] the story of Jesus' life,
[2600.66 → 2602.48] but we participate
[2602.48 → 2604.04] in the rehearsing
[2604.04 → 2606.08] of the church's history.
[2608.18 → 2610.82] Make no small thing about it.
[2610.82 → 2614.90] This is a practice
[2614.90 → 2616.20] of the church
[2616.20 → 2618.22] that is deeply rooted
[2618.22 → 2620.04] and purposeful,
[2620.56 → 2623.06] and so gives us roots
[2623.06 → 2625.34] and purpose in life,
[2625.54 → 2626.94] especially in a time
[2626.94 → 2628.32] and a place in the world
[2628.32 → 2629.68] where everything is shaky.
[2629.68 → 2630.76] Right?
[2630.80 → 2632.26] Where the ground beneath us
[2632.26 → 2633.44] seems to move
[2633.44 → 2634.40] and flutter
[2634.40 → 2635.46] and shift
[2635.46 → 2637.04] even as we try to stand.
[2637.28 → 2638.30] Where we try to reach out
[2638.30 → 2638.94] and grab hold
[2638.94 → 2639.78] of something firm
[2639.78 → 2641.12] only to open our hands
[2641.12 → 2642.04] and like the teacher says
[2642.04 → 2642.72] in Ecclesiastes,
[2642.94 → 2643.70] to realize
[2643.70 → 2645.02] it's a chasing after the wind.
[2646.90 → 2647.42] This,
[2647.82 → 2648.92] what you do,
[2649.28 → 2649.76] here,
[2650.64 → 2652.66] is an established
[2652.66 → 2654.48] history.
[2655.56 → 2656.18] And my prayer
[2656.18 → 2657.72] is that it is part of God
[2657.72 → 2658.62] establishing
[2658.62 → 2658.64] establishing
[2658.64 → 2660.50] your faith.
[2661.62 → 2662.60] This is no
[2662.60 → 2664.22] small thing.
[2664.88 → 2665.68] And as we rehearse
[2665.68 → 2666.34] this story,
[2666.70 → 2667.16] know that
[2667.16 → 2668.18] in the incarnation
[2668.18 → 2669.60] and in Christmas,
[2669.88 → 2670.10] right,
[2670.18 → 2670.90] we proclaim
[2670.90 → 2671.98] that God has
[2671.98 → 2673.32] remembered his people,
[2673.64 → 2674.42] he has remembered
[2674.42 → 2675.18] his promise,
[2675.38 → 2676.14] and God,
[2676.22 → 2676.82] Emmanuel,
[2677.36 → 2678.48] has now come
[2678.48 → 2679.88] to be with us.
[2680.84 → 2681.68] And in the life
[2681.68 → 2682.30] of Jesus,
[2682.30 → 2683.54] we rehearse the story
[2683.54 → 2684.80] and we proclaim
[2684.80 → 2685.96] with Jesus
[2685.96 → 2686.90] that he is
[2686.90 → 2688.10] the obedient one,
[2688.22 → 2689.90] he is the perfectly
[2689.90 → 2691.18] righteous one,
[2691.24 → 2692.26] and that he is
[2692.26 → 2692.86] the fulfilling
[2692.86 → 2693.96] of the law
[2693.96 → 2694.98] that we could never
[2694.98 → 2695.74] keep.
[2696.68 → 2697.72] And in the death
[2697.72 → 2698.40] of Jesus,
[2698.78 → 2699.86] he proclaims,
[2700.00 → 2701.08] I have paid
[2701.08 → 2701.70] the penalty
[2701.70 → 2703.18] for all of your failings.
[2703.40 → 2704.22] I have lived
[2704.22 → 2705.46] the life you should have lived
[2705.46 → 2706.34] and died the death
[2706.34 → 2707.28] that you deserved.
[2707.50 → 2708.34] I have paid
[2708.34 → 2709.68] for your rebellion.
[2709.82 → 2710.34] The punishment
[2710.34 → 2711.54] that brought you peace
[2711.54 → 2712.72] is on my shoulders.
[2712.72 → 2715.76] And in the resurrection,
[2716.08 → 2717.20] Jesus proclaims,
[2717.56 → 2718.50] I have won.
[2719.10 → 2720.38] Death is dead.
[2720.56 → 2721.88] God is victorious.
[2722.16 → 2722.80] And then tonight,
[2723.20 → 2724.06] in the ascension,
[2724.22 → 2725.56] this same Jesus says,
[2726.02 → 2727.64] I am king.
[2728.68 → 2730.18] Come to me,
[2730.56 → 2731.66] all who are weary
[2731.66 → 2732.44] and heavy laden,
[2732.48 → 2733.90] and I will give you rest.
[2734.28 → 2734.80] Jesus says,
[2734.92 → 2735.92] I am king.
[2736.06 → 2736.94] All authority
[2736.94 → 2737.86] in heaven
[2737.86 → 2738.38] and on earth
[2738.38 → 2739.48] has been given to me.
[2739.88 → 2741.06] Jesus proclaims
[2741.06 → 2741.76] in the ascension,
[2741.76 → 2743.14] mine is the name
[2743.14 → 2744.20] above all names.
[2744.56 → 2745.52] Jesus proclaims
[2745.52 → 2746.10] in the ascension,
[2746.28 → 2747.20] I am the one
[2747.20 → 2748.56] to whom every knee
[2748.56 → 2749.08] will bow
[2749.08 → 2750.00] and tongue confess
[2750.00 → 2750.46] in heaven
[2750.46 → 2751.00] and on earth
[2751.00 → 2751.84] and under the earth
[2751.84 → 2756.18] that I am the one
[2756.18 → 2758.16] to the glory
[2758.16 → 2760.30] of God the Father.
[2762.08 → 2763.42] There is a road
[2763.42 → 2764.80] for each
[2764.80 → 2766.74] and we rehearse those
[2766.74 → 2768.08] in the lives of faith,
[2768.20 → 2769.20] firmly rooting ourselves
[2769.20 → 2769.88] in the history
[2769.88 → 2771.12] of the church.
[2771.76 → 2774.98] But what we have
[2774.98 → 2776.38] to see tonight
[2776.38 → 2779.94] is that there is
[2779.94 → 2780.60] a road
[2780.60 → 2781.92] for each
[2781.92 → 2784.14] that cannot be
[2784.14 → 2785.26] shortcut.
[2787.14 → 2788.78] So in Matthew 4,
[2789.02 → 2789.88] it's in your books,
[2790.72 → 2792.76] Jesus has gone
[2792.76 → 2793.48] into the wilderness
[2793.48 → 2794.72] after the baptism
[2794.72 → 2796.18] and he is tempted
[2796.18 → 2797.32] by the devil.
[2797.32 → 2799.20] right?
[2799.26 → 2800.18] The devil tempts him
[2800.18 → 2800.64] twice
[2800.64 → 2801.46] and in the third
[2801.46 → 2802.10] temptation
[2802.10 → 2803.22] we read
[2803.22 → 2804.14] in verses 8
[2804.14 → 2804.92] and 9,
[2804.92 → 2805.92] again,
[2810.06 → 2810.90] the devil took him
[2810.90 → 2812.06] to a very high mountain
[2812.06 → 2812.78] and showed him
[2812.78 → 2813.62] all the kingdoms
[2813.62 → 2814.66] of the world
[2814.66 → 2815.72] and their splendour.
[2816.22 → 2816.82] All this
[2816.82 → 2817.68] I will give you,
[2817.74 → 2818.24] he said,
[2818.32 → 2819.82] if you bow down
[2819.82 → 2821.16] and worship
[2821.16 → 2822.42] me.
[2822.42 → 2826.28] today,
[2826.64 → 2828.96] I had the chance
[2828.96 → 2829.84] to go with
[2829.84 → 2830.62] a friend of mine
[2830.62 → 2831.10] who's visiting
[2831.10 → 2831.76] from Ontario
[2831.76 → 2834.54] to Seymour Mountain
[2834.54 → 2836.44] and then took the trail
[2836.44 → 2837.56] to the Dog Mountain
[2837.56 → 2837.94] lookout.
[2838.50 → 2839.12] I don't know if any
[2839.12 → 2839.68] of you have ever
[2839.68 → 2841.08] done that trail,
[2841.54 → 2842.64] but as you stand
[2842.64 → 2843.40] on the Dog Mountain
[2843.40 → 2843.74] lookout,
[2843.88 → 2844.86] you're north of Vancouver
[2844.86 → 2845.80] looking south
[2845.80 → 2847.26] and you can see
[2847.26 → 2848.78] today was crystal clear.
[2848.92 → 2849.68] We could see
[2849.68 → 2851.18] the Olympic
[2851.18 → 2852.80] Peninsula Mountains
[2852.80 → 2854.30] as far
[2854.30 → 2855.32] as that
[2855.32 → 2856.28] and so we could see
[2856.28 → 2857.16] everything
[2857.16 → 2858.88] and we could see
[2858.88 → 2859.38] Vancouver
[2859.38 → 2860.72] laid out before us.
[2861.42 → 2862.34] Knowing that I was
[2862.34 → 2863.40] preaching on this text,
[2863.48 → 2863.98] I kind of thought
[2863.98 → 2865.12] this is what Jesus
[2865.12 → 2865.98] would have experienced.
[2866.12 → 2866.56] He stood
[2866.56 → 2867.66] at the high place
[2867.66 → 2868.58] and he saw
[2868.58 → 2869.30] the kingdoms
[2869.30 → 2869.94] laid out
[2869.94 → 2871.00] before him
[2871.00 → 2873.08] and the devil said,
[2873.38 → 2873.86] all this
[2873.86 → 2874.76] I will give you
[2874.76 → 2876.42] if you bow down
[2876.42 → 2877.12] and worship me.
[2878.10 → 2879.24] But Jesus knows,
[2879.98 → 2880.32] right?
[2880.38 → 2881.04] He knows.
[2881.24 → 2881.92] He knows
[2881.92 → 2883.00] that he will get there,
[2883.48 → 2884.24] right?
[2884.26 → 2885.12] We've already heard it
[2885.12 → 2885.98] from Matthew 28,
[2886.10 → 2886.80] all authority
[2886.80 → 2887.72] in heaven and on earth
[2887.72 → 2888.74] has been given to me,
[2889.12 → 2891.12] but Jesus knows
[2891.12 → 2892.26] there is a road
[2892.26 → 2893.36] for each.
[2894.58 → 2896.20] There is a right path
[2896.20 → 2897.58] to get there.
[2898.54 → 2899.42] The second text
[2899.42 → 2900.22] that's in your books,
[2900.42 → 2901.08] Hebrews 1,
[2901.86 → 2902.20] says,
[2902.32 → 2902.50] again,
[2902.64 → 2903.36] he will get there.
[2903.46 → 2903.92] The sun
[2903.92 → 2904.92] is the radiance
[2904.92 → 2905.84] of God's glory
[2905.84 → 2906.62] and the exact
[2906.62 → 2907.16] representation
[2907.16 → 2908.12] of his being,
[2908.26 → 2909.52] sustaining all things
[2909.52 → 2910.74] by his powerful word.
[2911.64 → 2913.12] And after he had provided
[2913.12 → 2914.92] purification for sins,
[2915.02 → 2915.98] he sat down
[2915.98 → 2916.96] at the right hand
[2916.96 → 2918.02] of the majesty
[2918.02 → 2918.96] in heaven.
[2919.74 → 2920.70] And so he became
[2920.70 → 2921.52] much superior
[2921.52 → 2922.30] to the angels
[2922.30 → 2922.92] as the name
[2922.92 → 2923.90] he has inherited
[2923.90 → 2924.98] is superior
[2924.98 → 2926.06] to theirs.
[2927.96 → 2928.48] Right?
[2928.52 → 2929.22] He gets there,
[2929.88 → 2931.82] but there's a road
[2931.82 → 2933.12] for each.
[2933.12 → 2935.46] And after he provided
[2935.46 → 2936.16] purification
[2936.16 → 2937.08] for sins,
[2937.22 → 2938.10] he sat down
[2938.10 → 2939.36] at the right hand
[2939.36 → 2940.34] of the Father.
[2941.20 → 2942.36] I don't think
[2942.36 → 2943.26] the author of Hebrews
[2943.26 → 2944.80] has only in mind
[2944.80 → 2945.16] there
[2945.16 → 2946.28] a chronology
[2946.28 → 2947.12] of events.
[2948.02 → 2949.44] I think the author
[2949.44 → 2949.96] of Hebrews
[2949.96 → 2951.16] has a necessary
[2951.16 → 2951.82] order
[2951.82 → 2953.28] in mind.
[2954.28 → 2955.26] Such that
[2955.26 → 2956.02] the road
[2956.02 → 2957.80] to heaven,
[2958.40 → 2959.36] the road
[2959.36 → 2960.28] to the right hand
[2960.28 → 2960.96] of the Father,
[2961.28 → 2961.72] the road
[2961.72 → 2962.26] for Jesus
[2962.26 → 2963.14] to that throne
[2963.14 → 2964.28] above all thrones,
[2964.62 → 2965.12] the road
[2965.12 → 2965.58] for Jesus
[2965.58 → 2966.70] to all authority
[2966.70 → 2968.18] in heaven
[2968.18 → 2968.84] and on earth
[2968.84 → 2970.12] had to go
[2970.12 → 2971.88] through the cross.
[2974.78 → 2975.72] What the devil
[2975.72 → 2976.36] offered him
[2976.36 → 2976.84] as he stood
[2976.84 → 2977.50] on that peak
[2977.50 → 2978.20] and looked out
[2978.20 → 2979.80] over the world
[2979.80 → 2981.34] was his.
[2982.56 → 2982.78] Right?
[2982.82 → 2983.64] The irony is that
[2983.64 → 2984.50] not only did
[2984.50 → 2986.26] he creates it,
[2986.72 → 2987.00] right,
[2987.12 → 2988.20] for by him
[2988.20 → 2988.90] and through him
[2988.90 → 2990.10] are all things,
[2990.26 → 2991.62] like by the word
[2991.62 → 2992.26] of Jesus
[2992.26 → 2992.96] all things
[2992.96 → 2993.60] are created.
[2993.74 → 2994.52] The devil says
[2994.52 → 2995.28] to the one
[2995.28 → 2996.04] who created it,
[2996.24 → 2996.60] hey man,
[2996.64 → 2997.52] I'll give you this
[2997.52 → 2999.38] if you worship me
[2999.38 → 3001.42] and I can't imagine,
[3001.90 → 3002.96] I can only imagine
[3002.96 → 3003.62] Jesus going,
[3004.20 → 3005.14] you know I spoke
[3005.14 → 3006.04] this into being,
[3006.58 → 3006.92] right?
[3009.74 → 3011.22] But Jesus knows
[3011.22 → 3013.40] that the way
[3013.40 → 3014.80] to this
[3014.80 → 3016.52] all authority
[3016.52 → 3017.82] to this throne
[3017.82 → 3019.20] has to be
[3019.20 → 3021.28] through the cross.
[3022.92 → 3023.58] Kingship
[3023.58 → 3025.20] rightly belongs
[3025.20 → 3025.76] to Jesus.
[3026.22 → 3027.14] That's what we proclaim
[3027.14 → 3028.00] on Ascension Day,
[3028.12 → 3030.08] that Jesus is king,
[3030.22 → 3031.50] but the means
[3031.50 → 3032.54] of his being
[3032.54 → 3033.14] exalted
[3033.14 → 3033.98] and named
[3033.98 → 3034.90] as king
[3034.90 → 3036.72] cannot be
[3036.72 → 3037.46] cut short
[3037.46 → 3038.32] or shortcut.
[3040.64 → 3042.00] It has to go
[3042.00 → 3042.72] through the cross.
[3042.72 → 3045.36] And so,
[3045.74 → 3047.06] as we have seen
[3047.06 → 3048.40] and as the history
[3048.40 → 3049.06] of the church
[3049.06 → 3049.86] has affirmed
[3049.86 → 3050.66] and as the very
[3050.66 → 3051.84] liturgical practices
[3051.84 → 3053.04] that we have lived
[3053.04 → 3054.54] into and rehearsed
[3054.54 → 3054.94] tonight
[3054.94 → 3056.34] say over and over
[3056.34 → 3056.72] again,
[3057.02 → 3058.28] the Ascension of Jesus
[3058.28 → 3059.84] is a deep hope
[3059.84 → 3060.66] for you
[3060.66 → 3061.58] and for me.
[3061.82 → 3062.76] The Ascension of Jesus
[3062.76 → 3063.82] is a necessary,
[3064.28 → 3064.80] beautiful,
[3064.94 → 3065.90] gospel reality
[3065.90 → 3067.34] available to us.
[3067.34 → 3070.22] but I want to suggest
[3070.22 → 3071.84] that the Ascension
[3071.84 → 3072.34] of Jesus
[3072.34 → 3073.30] is also
[3073.30 → 3074.26] a pattern
[3074.26 → 3075.76] for us.
[3080.40 → 3081.24] Here's the promise
[3081.24 → 3081.74] of God
[3081.74 → 3082.50] for those of us
[3082.50 → 3082.98] who believe.
[3084.16 → 3084.72] That you will be
[3084.72 → 3085.30] granted heaven,
[3085.86 → 3086.72] that you will be
[3086.72 → 3087.52] given a reward
[3087.52 → 3088.76] and that you will know
[3088.76 → 3090.60] amazing glory
[3090.60 → 3091.78] and the infinite
[3091.78 → 3092.84] beauty of God
[3092.84 → 3093.48] our Father.
[3094.82 → 3095.72] In 1 Peter,
[3095.72 → 3096.30] we are told
[3096.30 → 3097.58] that we will receive
[3097.58 → 3098.92] a crown of glory
[3098.92 → 3100.22] that will never fade away.
[3101.36 → 3102.64] In Revelation 2,
[3102.72 → 3103.24] verse 10,
[3103.50 → 3104.44] the letter to the church,
[3104.84 → 3105.90] they are praised
[3105.90 → 3107.14] and they are promised
[3107.14 → 3108.28] that if they are faithful
[3108.28 → 3108.90] to the end,
[3108.98 → 3109.76] they will receive
[3109.76 → 3111.00] the victor's crown.
[3112.08 → 3112.48] James,
[3112.64 → 3113.66] talking about the same thing,
[3113.74 → 3115.30] calls it the crown of life.
[3115.66 → 3116.72] Timothy refers to this
[3116.72 → 3118.22] as the crown of righteousness.
[3119.74 → 3121.34] The truth of the gospel
[3121.34 → 3122.30] and the truth
[3122.30 → 3123.46] of what Jesus has done
[3123.46 → 3123.94] and the truth
[3123.94 → 3124.64] of his ascension
[3124.64 → 3126.40] is as 2 Timothy 2 says,
[3126.68 → 3127.72] if we died with him,
[3127.78 → 3128.94] we will also live with him.
[3129.14 → 3130.00] If we endure,
[3130.40 → 3132.14] we will also reign
[3132.14 → 3133.42] with him.
[3135.02 → 3136.12] The Bible ends,
[3136.16 → 3136.68] for those of you
[3136.68 → 3137.22] who haven't got
[3137.22 → 3137.98] to the end yet,
[3138.24 → 3138.96] the Bible ends
[3138.96 → 3140.06] in Revelation 20,
[3140.12 → 3141.02] 21, and 22
[3141.02 → 3143.00] with all of those
[3143.00 → 3143.56] who believe,
[3143.66 → 3144.54] the bride of Christ,
[3144.82 → 3145.28] it says,
[3145.48 → 3146.94] reigning with Christ
[3146.94 → 3147.92] forever.
[3150.56 → 3151.64] The ascension
[3151.64 → 3153.16] is a guarantee
[3153.16 → 3155.24] of that future reality.
[3155.24 → 3156.38] The ascension
[3156.38 → 3157.18] is a guarantee
[3157.18 → 3158.88] of that crown of glory.
[3159.24 → 3159.76] The ascension
[3159.76 → 3160.54] is a guarantee
[3160.54 → 3162.96] of that promised future.
[3165.28 → 3166.74] But there is a road
[3166.74 → 3168.36] for each.
[3169.96 → 3171.00] And so even as
[3171.00 → 3171.96] the ascension of Jesus
[3171.96 → 3173.44] is a guarantee for us,
[3173.44 → 3175.66] we also have to see
[3175.66 → 3177.36] that just like for Jesus,
[3177.36 → 3181.00] we have to go through
[3181.00 → 3182.72] the cross.
[3184.10 → 3185.52] Jesus himself promised
[3185.52 → 3186.44] that in this world
[3186.44 → 3187.40] you will have trouble.
[3189.38 → 3189.74] Jesus,
[3190.14 → 3191.74] or 1 Peter says,
[3192.14 → 3192.68] dear friends,
[3192.82 → 3193.92] do not be surprised
[3193.92 → 3195.24] at the fiery ordeal
[3195.24 → 3196.10] that has come on you
[3196.10 → 3196.90] to test you
[3196.90 → 3197.98] as though something strange
[3197.98 → 3198.86] were happening to you.
[3199.66 → 3200.48] Peter's point there
[3200.48 → 3201.68] is this is normal.
[3202.40 → 3203.72] Don't be surprised.
[3204.60 → 3205.46] Over and over again,
[3205.52 → 3205.88] the Bible says,
[3205.88 → 3206.74] anyone who wants
[3206.74 → 3208.18] to follow after God
[3208.18 → 3209.74] is going to face opposition.
[3209.96 → 3210.50] Anyone who wants
[3210.50 → 3211.18] to be holy
[3211.18 → 3212.70] is going to face persecution.
[3213.60 → 3214.28] This is the truth
[3214.28 → 3214.90] of what it means
[3214.90 → 3216.48] to be a disciple of Jesus.
[3216.66 → 3217.90] Jesus himself said
[3217.90 → 3218.58] in Luke 9,
[3218.70 → 3219.34] whoever wants
[3219.34 → 3220.26] to be my disciple
[3220.26 → 3221.82] must deny themselves,
[3222.04 → 3223.68] take up their cross daily
[3223.68 → 3225.32] and follow me.
[3225.44 → 3225.88] Whoever wants
[3225.88 → 3226.92] to save their lives
[3226.92 → 3227.46] will lose it,
[3227.54 → 3228.32] but whoever loses
[3228.32 → 3230.14] his life for my sake
[3230.14 → 3231.86] will save it.
[3231.86 → 3236.20] the end of the journey
[3236.20 → 3237.20] for the Christian
[3237.20 → 3239.66] is reigning in glory
[3239.66 → 3240.80] with Jesus.
[3242.48 → 3243.74] But the way there
[3243.74 → 3245.86] is to daily take up
[3245.86 → 3246.44] your cross
[3246.44 → 3248.26] and follow him.
[3250.20 → 3251.68] And so don't be surprised
[3251.68 → 3253.48] when this world
[3253.48 → 3254.74] challenges you
[3254.74 → 3256.20] or don't be surprised
[3256.20 → 3257.64] when this world
[3257.64 → 3258.74] offers you
[3258.74 → 3259.76] a way to shortcut
[3259.76 → 3261.76] that hardship.
[3263.06 → 3264.28] But it won't do.
[3265.44 → 3266.38] It can't do.
[3267.30 → 3268.66] The way to the crown
[3268.66 → 3269.26] of glory
[3269.26 → 3270.04] is only
[3270.04 → 3271.98] through the cruciform
[3271.98 → 3272.92] life.
[3273.82 → 3274.86] It's only through
[3274.86 → 3275.62] the dying
[3275.62 → 3276.70] to self
[3276.70 → 3278.02] and the daily
[3278.02 → 3278.68] rising
[3278.68 → 3281.02] with Jesus Christ.
[3281.02 → 3283.20] we live in a world
[3283.20 → 3284.14] and we live in a place
[3284.14 → 3285.38] where the two
[3285.38 → 3286.82] seemingly greatest
[3286.82 → 3287.74] temptations
[3287.74 → 3289.24] are comfort
[3289.24 → 3291.82] and power.
[3293.32 → 3294.08] Now those might
[3294.08 → 3294.60] look differently
[3294.60 → 3295.04] for you.
[3295.14 → 3295.54] You might have
[3295.54 → 3296.26] a different definition
[3296.26 → 3296.82] of comfort
[3296.82 → 3297.88] than is over here
[3297.88 → 3298.42] and you might have
[3298.42 → 3299.44] a definition of power
[3299.44 → 3300.14] or accomplishment
[3300.14 → 3300.76] or status
[3300.76 → 3301.94] than what's over here
[3301.94 → 3302.82] but ultimately
[3302.82 → 3304.16] comfort and power
[3304.16 → 3305.02] are on offer
[3305.02 → 3306.46] and Jesus says
[3306.46 → 3308.84] I will make you
[3308.84 → 3309.52] uncomfortable
[3309.52 → 3313.40] and Jesus says
[3313.40 → 3314.16] power isn't
[3314.16 → 3314.74] what you think
[3314.74 → 3315.20] it is.
[3315.92 → 3316.74] It doesn't look
[3316.74 → 3317.68] like what you
[3317.68 → 3318.74] think it looks like.
[3321.10 → 3322.10] My power
[3322.10 → 3322.88] is made perfect
[3322.88 → 3323.72] in weakness
[3323.72 → 3325.30] says God.
[3326.30 → 3327.22] The greatest
[3327.22 → 3328.10] of these
[3328.10 → 3329.10] must become
[3329.10 → 3329.72] the least
[3329.72 → 3331.16] says Jesus.
[3333.56 → 3334.60] My prayer
[3334.60 → 3335.68] for us all
[3335.68 → 3337.18] as we rehearse
[3337.18 → 3338.10] this story
[3338.10 → 3339.16] is that we will
[3339.16 → 3341.08] see that crown
[3341.08 → 3341.82] of glory
[3341.82 → 3342.80] and that we will
[3342.80 → 3343.68] see the Lord
[3343.68 → 3344.48] Jesus Christ
[3344.48 → 3345.20] that risen
[3345.20 → 3345.96] lamb
[3345.96 → 3347.18] and we will
[3347.18 → 3348.74] press towards him
[3348.74 → 3349.78] come what may
[3349.78 → 3350.98] as we daily
[3350.98 → 3352.34] take up our
[3352.34 → 3353.12] cross
[3353.12 → 3353.82] and follow
[3353.82 → 3354.74] him.
[3356.42 → 3356.96] Kingship
[3356.96 → 3358.04] rightly belongs
[3358.04 → 3359.00] to Jesus
[3359.00 → 3361.52] but having Jesus
[3361.52 → 3362.20] as your king
[3362.20 → 3363.64] means your life
[3363.64 → 3364.24] is going to look
[3364.24 → 3365.14] a little bit different
[3365.14 → 3366.78] than everyone else
[3366.78 → 3368.10] who doesn't
[3368.10 → 3368.60] yet know
[3368.60 → 3369.46] who Jesus
[3369.46 → 3369.88] is.
[3370.92 → 3371.50] And that's
[3371.50 → 3372.30] why we enter
[3372.30 → 3373.28] into this
[3373.28 → 3374.04] story
[3374.04 → 3374.88] again
[3374.88 → 3375.82] and again
[3375.82 → 3376.68] and again
[3376.68 → 3377.94] so that we
[3377.94 → 3378.74] can be grounded
[3378.74 → 3379.96] in the truth
[3379.96 → 3381.30] and in the person
[3381.30 → 3382.08] of Jesus
[3382.08 → 3382.96] and so that we
[3382.96 → 3383.90] together can be
[3383.90 → 3385.30] filled with his
[3385.30 → 3386.04] Holy Spirit
[3386.04 → 3386.86] so that we
[3386.86 → 3388.34] may endure.
[3389.40 → 3390.34] I pray
[3390.34 → 3391.04] that you
[3391.04 → 3392.20] will endure
[3392.20 → 3393.24] together.
[3393.98 → 3394.26] Amen?
[3394.26 → 3394.40] Amen.
[3396.32 → 3396.92] Let's stand
[3396.92 → 3397.70] as we pray.
[3402.34 → 3403.38] Lord Jesus
[3403.38 → 3405.06] move in
[3405.06 → 3405.60] us
[3405.60 → 3406.38] by your
[3406.38 → 3406.86] spirit.
[3407.98 → 3408.94] Move in
[3408.94 → 3409.34] us
[3409.34 → 3409.70] with
[3409.70 → 3410.58] your
[3410.58 → 3411.44] Holy Spirit
[3411.44 → 3412.10] power
[3412.10 → 3413.06] comforting
[3413.06 → 3413.84] us
[3413.84 → 3415.14] even as
[3415.14 → 3415.58] you make
[3415.58 → 3415.82] us
[3415.82 → 3416.46] uncomfortable.
[3418.86 → 3419.58] Move
[3419.58 → 3420.48] in us
[3420.48 → 3421.80] with a
[3421.80 → 3422.32] newness
[3422.32 → 3423.04] of life
[3423.04 → 3424.06] even as
[3424.06 → 3425.36] we face
[3425.36 → 3426.04] death
[3426.04 → 3427.10] all day.
[3428.60 → 3429.18] Move in
[3429.18 → 3429.54] us
[3429.54 → 3430.02] with a
[3430.02 → 3430.86] power
[3430.86 → 3432.08] unimaginable
[3432.08 → 3432.70] and a
[3432.70 → 3433.18] love
[3433.18 → 3434.40] incomprehensible
[3434.40 → 3436.26] so that as
[3436.26 → 3436.90] we go
[3436.90 → 3437.94] from this
[3437.94 → 3438.42] place
[3438.42 → 3439.04] we might
[3439.04 → 3439.46] go
[3439.46 → 3440.70] nourished
[3440.70 → 3441.44] and sustained
[3441.44 → 3441.90] that we
[3441.90 → 3442.42] might go
[3442.42 → 3443.24] buoyed
[3443.24 → 3443.82] in our
[3443.82 → 3444.38] lives
[3444.38 → 3444.96] of faith
[3444.96 → 3446.30] that we
[3446.30 → 3446.86] might go
[3446.86 → 3447.56] such that
[3447.56 → 3447.98] we can
[3447.98 → 3448.42] daily
[3448.42 → 3449.08] take up
[3449.08 → 3449.74] our cross
[3449.74 → 3450.62] and follow
[3450.62 → 3451.70] after you.
[3453.04 → 3455.16] if we
[3455.16 → 3455.52] endure
[3455.52 → 3456.10] with him
[3456.10 → 3456.94] we will
[3456.94 → 3457.38] also
[3457.38 → 3457.98] reign
[3457.98 → 3458.76] with him.
[3460.46 → 3461.20] And so
[3461.20 → 3461.76] Lord Jesus
[3461.76 → 3463.58] draw us
[3463.58 → 3464.48] to your
[3464.48 → 3465.54] Victor's
[3465.54 → 3466.12] crown.
[3466.12 → 3467.62] Amen.
[3483.04 → 3495.20] death
[3495.20 → 3496.62] and
[3496.62 → 3499.04] remember
[3499.04 → 3499.38] I
[3499.38 → 3507.38] I've spent the day with the presence of Jesus as a ring.
[3507.38 → 3517.38] And wonder how he could love me, a sinner that loved me.
[3517.38 → 3527.38] Sing, how marvellous, how wonderful that my song shall ever be.
[3527.38 → 3538.38] How marvellous, how wonderful is my Saviour's love for me.
[3538.38 → 3550.38] He took my sins and my sorrows, He made them very whole.
[3550.38 → 3560.38] And he poured the word into Calvary, Unbuffered and died alone.
[3560.38 → 3570.38] Sing, how marvellous, how wonderful that my song shall ever be.
[3570.38 → 3581.38] How marvellous, how wonderful is my Saviour's love for me.
[3581.38 → 3593.38] And in the ransomed in glory, His face that I shall see.
[3593.38 → 3602.38] And will be my Lord in the angels to sing of His love for me.
[3602.38 → 3612.38] Sing, how marvellous, how wonderful that my song shall ever be.
[3612.38 → 3621.38] Sing, how marvellous, how wonderful is my Saviour's love for me.
[3621.38 → 3633.38] Sing, how marvellous, how wonderful that my song shall ever be.
[3633.38 → 3645.38] How marvellous, how wonderful is my Saviour's love for me.
[3651.38 → 3661.38] They were looking up intently into the sky as He was going,
[3661.38 → 3665.38] when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them.
[3665.38 → 3669.38] Men of Galilee, they said, why do you stand here looking into the sky?
[3669.38 → 3675.38] This same Jesus who has been taken from you into heaven will come back
[3675.38 → 3680.38] in the same way that you have seen Him go into heaven.
[3680.38 → 3685.38] This is our greatest hope yet.
[3685.38 → 3689.38] That this same Jesus will come back.
[3689.38 → 3695.38] Until that day we go from here with God and so receive His blessing.
[3695.38 → 3699.38] May God go before you to prepare a way for you.
[3699.38 → 3701.38] May God go behind you to protect you.
[3701.38 → 3704.38] May God go beneath you to support you.
[3704.38 → 3707.38] And may God go beside you to befriend you.
[3707.38 → 3709.38] Do not be afraid.
[3709.38 → 3711.38] Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[3711.38 → 3713.38] Do not be afraid.
[3713.38 → 3718.38] Go in peace to love and serve your King.
[3718.38 → 3720.38] All God's people said, Amen.
[3720.38 → 3721.38] Amen.
[3721.38 → 3722.38] Amen.
[3722.38 → 3723.38] Amen.
[3723.38 → 3736.38] Amen.
[3736.38 → 3761.38] Unto the King eternal, unto the King immortal, unto the King invisible, the only white child.
[3761.38 → 3768.38] The only white child.
[3771.38 → 3789.38] Now unto the King eternal, unto the King immortal, unto the King immortal, unto the King invisible,
[3789.38 → 3796.38] the only white child.
[3796.38 → 3802.38] The only white child.
[3802.38 → 3817.38] Now unto the King, be glory and honour, unto the King forever.
[3817.38 → 3824.38] Unto the King be glory and honour forever.
[3824.38 → 3826.38] Amen.
[3826.38 → 3827.38] Amen.
[3827.38 → 3829.38] Amen.
[3829.38 → 3839.38] Amen.
[3839.38 → 3844.38] Amen.
[3844.38 → 3849.38] Amen.
[3849.38 → 3852.18] Amen.
[3879.38 → 3880.38] Yes.
[3909.38 → 3910.38] Amen.
