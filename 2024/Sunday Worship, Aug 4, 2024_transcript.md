[76.84 --> 81.80]  I know that while in heaven he stands
[81.80 --> 86.48]  No tongue can bid me this deep heart
[86.48 --> 91.36]  No tongue can bid me this deep heart
[91.36 --> 96.08]  When Satan tempts me to despair
[96.08 --> 100.92]  And tells me of the guilt within
[100.92 --> 105.92]  Upwards I look and see and then
[105.92 --> 110.76]  Who made an end of all my sin

[197.60 --> 202.48]  With Christ my Savior and my God
[213.10 --> 221.26]  One with His Savior and his Lord
[221.26 --> 224.26]  I am so happy to be saved
[224.26 --> 231.00]  My grace was my Savior and my Savior
[231.00 --> 247.14]  Where's your heart at?
[248.96 --> 251.76]  Is it gripped by idols?
[253.42 --> 255.64]  Where's your head at?
[255.64 --> 261.02]  Is it lost in foolish strife?
[261.74 --> 263.54]  Where'd your lips speak?
[265.54 --> 268.50]  Do they praise and curse at the same time?
[273.38 --> 275.32]  Good morning.
[276.90 --> 279.14]  Welcome to worship.
[279.38 --> 282.86]  A special welcome if you are a guest with us this morning.
[283.04 --> 283.82]  My name is Chris.
[284.50 --> 286.30]  I'm one of the pastors here.
[286.82 --> 289.70]  And in fact, this is the last time you'll see me on stage this morning.
[289.80 --> 291.82]  Because Pastor Kevin is going to lead us in preaching.
[292.44 --> 294.60]  And others are up here leading as well.
[294.78 --> 302.22]  So if you are here this morning and wondering about what it is that you can sign up for and volunteer.
[302.54 --> 303.66]  Because that's at least one of you.
[304.38 --> 306.14]  Do we have an announcement for you?
[307.28 --> 311.22]  Coming in September, we're hosting Reactivate, which is a youth conference.
[311.22 --> 318.20]  We get youth from Christian Reformed churches all over BC who descend into our space here.
[318.60 --> 322.86]  And about 200 of them come for the weekend to worship and to learn.
[323.42 --> 324.32]  And we host them.
[324.68 --> 326.48]  And to do that, we need a bunch of volunteers.
[326.82 --> 330.24]  And so we've had a volunteer list out for quite some time.
[330.86 --> 331.96]  It's in the e-bulletin.
[332.46 --> 336.54]  There are 40 vacancies that still need to be filled.
[336.54 --> 339.52]  So 40 volunteer slots that need to plug in.
[339.64 --> 344.20]  So even if you've signed up for one already, maybe go back and check if you've got another spot in you.
[344.58 --> 346.06]  So we can round that out together.
[347.50 --> 352.48]  That being said, it is an amazing weekend and a wonderful time.
[352.58 --> 355.30]  So I really encourage you to check that out and to connect there.
[355.94 --> 361.12]  As far as announcements go for me, just the last one is more of a prayerful announcement.
[361.12 --> 366.86]  And that's next week, Sunday, when we gather for worship, we're going to participate in Lord's Supper together.
[367.56 --> 372.80]  And so we encourage you to use this week to prepare your hearts and to talk with your families, if you have them,
[373.26 --> 377.04]  about what it means to come to the table, be ushered into the presence of God,
[377.10 --> 379.86]  and to taste and see that the Lord is good.
[380.86 --> 385.54]  With those two things out of the way, I'm going to invite you to stand, if you are able, and as you are able.
[385.74 --> 387.86]  And we're going to be welcomed into God's presence.
[387.86 --> 392.64]  Following the greeting of God, I invite you to turn to those around you and welcome them into worship.
[393.16 --> 395.60]  You can do that by passing the peace of Christ, saying,
[395.68 --> 397.40]  The Lord be with you, peace of Christ.
[397.98 --> 402.50]  Or you can shake a hand, you can do a fist bump, you can nod your head,
[402.64 --> 406.30]  you can look glaringly at the person beside you who forgot to put deodorant on.
[406.74 --> 409.66]  Whatever the case may be, welcome them in the Lord.
[410.10 --> 411.40]  Receive God's greeting.
[411.40 --> 420.94]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Savior,
[421.40 --> 423.76]  through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[424.36 --> 424.62]  Amen.
[424.62 --> 424.74]  Amen.
[424.74 --> 424.78]  Amen.
[441.40 --> 458.70]  Good morning, everyone.

[1633.78 --> 1634.78]  A big river.
[1634.78 --> 1636.78]  Well we're going to spend...
[1636.78 --> 1637.78]  Oh.
[1637.78 --> 1638.78]  Really?
[1638.78 --> 1641.78]  That is very exciting.
[1641.78 --> 1643.78]  Well we're going to do something else very exciting right now.
[1643.78 --> 1644.78]  Do you know what we're going to do?
[1644.78 --> 1647.78]  We're going to pray and then we're going to go to children's worship time.
[1647.78 --> 1648.78]  Does that sound fun?
[1648.78 --> 1649.78]  Yeah?
[1649.78 --> 1651.78]  Okay, so let's pray, let's fold our hands and close our eyes,
[1651.78 --> 1654.78]  and then we're going to do the Lord's blessing or the children's blessing.
[1654.78 --> 1655.78]  Okay?
[1655.78 --> 1656.78]  All right, let's pray.
[1656.78 --> 1659.78]  Dear God, thank you so much that we could come to church today
[1659.78 --> 1662.78]  and we pray for the kids now as they go to children's worship time
[1662.78 --> 1664.78]  and the grown-ups as we stay back here.
[1664.78 --> 1666.78]  May we all learn a little bit more about you today.
[1666.78 --> 1668.78]  We pray this in your name.
[1668.78 --> 1669.78]  Amen.
[1669.78 --> 1672.78]  Okay, before you run off, let's everybody stand up
[1672.78 --> 1675.78]  and then we're going to say the Lord be with you at the same time.
[1675.78 --> 1676.78]  Are you ready?
[1676.78 --> 1677.78]  Let's say it together.
[1677.78 --> 1679.78]  God the Lord.
[1679.78 --> 1682.78]  And also with you.
[1682.78 --> 1685.78]  Come with me, Naomi.
[1707.78 --> 1715.00]  Hi, my name is Courtney and it is my privilege to lead us all in the congregational prayer.
[1715.38 --> 1716.36]  Please bow your heads with me.
[1718.06 --> 1722.36]  Dear Heavenly Foddler, thank you for the opportunity for us to gather together this morning.
[1722.90 --> 1725.58]  We praise you for the healing that you have brought to Everly Varshtra.
[1726.06 --> 1729.96]  Thank you that everything came back clear from the surgery site and lymph node biopsy.
[1730.96 --> 1739.68]  Give Stephen and Karen strength and patience as they are waiting on the results from her MRI and her gene sequencing test to determine the next steps.
[1740.28 --> 1742.40]  Please bring continued healing in Everly's body.
[1743.52 --> 1747.78]  Be near to Emo and Benita Smid as Emo goes in for open heart surgery.
[1748.44 --> 1750.78]  Give him patience as his surgery has been postponed.
[1751.70 --> 1753.70]  Give them your peace and strength during this time.
[1753.70 --> 1761.62]  Be with Tanya, sister to Amanda Hogan-Wonning, who is currently in the hospital undergoing tests for spots seen on her lungs.
[1762.22 --> 1765.14]  Give her strength and comfort as she waits for the test results.
[1767.12 --> 1773.02]  We ask that you be with Nick Kolein and Kelsey Craddock as they plan to be married in Fort Langley this week.
[1773.44 --> 1775.74]  Grant them your blessing as they begin their new life together.
[1776.84 --> 1780.30]  Thank you for summer and for a time of relaxation and travel.
[1780.80 --> 1782.04]  Help us to feel refreshed.
[1782.04 --> 1785.14]  Give all those who are traveling your traveling mercies.
[1785.78 --> 1789.92]  We thank you for every blessing you have poured into our lives, seen and unseen.
[1790.38 --> 1793.42]  Your handiwork is evident in all aspects of our existence.
[1794.26 --> 1799.86]  We are grateful for the many ways you enrich our journey, often beyond what we recognize or request.
[1800.82 --> 1803.64]  We lift up those who are facing challenges within their families.
[1804.24 --> 1809.42]  Bring healing to strained relationships, understanding where there is conflict, and love where there is hurt.
[1809.42 --> 1813.62]  Guide each family member in navigating their difficulties with grace and empathy.
[1815.08 --> 1817.52]  Be with Kevin as he delivers us your word today.
[1817.82 --> 1818.60]  Bless the message.
[1818.78 --> 1820.70]  May it be your word spoken through him.
[1821.18 --> 1823.08]  Give us open hearts to receive the message.
[1823.74 --> 1825.80]  We pray this all in Jesus' most holy name.
[1825.80 --> 1826.14]  Amen.
[1826.14 --> 1826.26]  Amen.
[1826.26 --> 1853.96]  So, since September of 2018, I have had the opportunity and the privilege,
[1853.96 --> 1861.48]  and probably about 85% of the time, the joy of going to seminary to receive my Master's of Divinity.
[1862.48 --> 1868.58]  I'm about 28 and three quarters of the way through, and I've got three and a quarter left.
[1869.28 --> 1873.10]  And at first, I thought I was going there, and when I was done and getting my Master's of Divinity,
[1873.18 --> 1874.08]  I could become a wizard.
[1874.34 --> 1878.72]  But I found out a few years in that it's actually become a pastor, which is also pretty neat.
[1878.72 --> 1886.64]  Now, I tell you this because one of the coolest parts of seminary are the people that I get to take classes with.
[1887.30 --> 1893.24]  For example, I just finished a course on the Reformed creeds and confessions with 10 other students.
[1893.36 --> 1894.42]  There was 11 of us total.
[1894.52 --> 1897.04]  And in that class, the students were from all over the world.
[1897.78 --> 1903.06]  There was a student from China, from Korea, from Belize, from Uganda, even Michigan.
[1903.06 --> 1908.52]  In another class that I'm still just kind of wrapping up, it's a similar situation.
[1908.60 --> 1911.86]  There's only nine of us in that class, but again, there's students from all over the world.
[1911.94 --> 1919.96]  There's a student from the Philippines, from Korea, from Nigeria, from Uganda, and from White Horse Yukon.
[1921.40 --> 1926.70]  Now that school's sort of done online by most people, attending classes with people from all over the world
[1926.70 --> 1929.40]  has become kind of the norm, at least in my experience.
[1929.40 --> 1935.30]  And I've had the privilege to learn alongside these Christians who are gaining the same education that I am,
[1935.46 --> 1939.46]  but they're applying it to contexts and cultures that are so much different than mine.
[1940.02 --> 1944.78]  So in these churches found in Africa or Asia or South America, the challenges that they face
[1944.78 --> 1950.08]  are just different than the challenges I face in my church, and it's fascinating discussing that with them.
[1950.72 --> 1955.06]  A hot-button doctrines that we are finding here in Canada are not even debated overseas,
[1955.66 --> 1957.98]  but things that they are challenged with we don't even think about.
[1957.98 --> 1963.64]  I love hearing their stories, and they love hearing about what's happening here,
[1963.68 --> 1965.68]  and it's been very beneficial for me to take in.
[1966.72 --> 1970.36]  Well, today we're going to look at a couple of stories in the book of Acts
[1970.36 --> 1976.00]  that tie into this idea of sort of believers beyond borders, which sounds like a reality TV show.
[1976.56 --> 1982.76]  The hope is that we were going to come to realize just how the kingdom of God that Jesus illustrates
[1982.76 --> 1986.20]  in the Bible is one of unity in diversity.
[1986.70 --> 1989.70]  And so turn with me now, please, to Acts chapter 10.
[1990.24 --> 1993.14]  We're going to read verses 23 through 48.
[1993.48 --> 1994.56]  Please use your Bibles.
[1994.62 --> 1997.04]  If you've brought them along, you can grab a Bible in the back.
[1997.12 --> 1997.96]  There's plenty there.
[1998.18 --> 2002.56]  You can also open up your phone, use your apps, but please do have those Bibles in front of you
[2002.56 --> 2006.02]  because we're going to be kind of hopping around all over the New Testament today
[2006.02 --> 2008.02]  and around Acts specifically.
[2009.28 --> 2012.74]  We're going to go over the events leading up to verse 23 in our text,
[2012.84 --> 2015.34]  but just as a quick one-sentence summary of what's going on here,
[2015.86 --> 2020.38]  Peter has just had a vision of a bunch of animals that he's now allowed to eat,
[2020.44 --> 2024.60]  which confuses him, and now he's heading to Cornelius' house,
[2024.68 --> 2028.92]  who is a Roman centurion and a Gentile whom God has arranged for him to meet.
[2029.72 --> 2033.62]  All right, so Peter's on the way to meet this man when our text picks up today.
[2033.62 --> 2034.96]  So join me in reading Acts 10.
[2035.16 --> 2038.42]  We're going to start verse 23, and we're going to read through 48.
[2038.58 --> 2041.70]  We're actually starting halfway through 23, but if you read it, you'll see that there.
[2043.30 --> 2044.40]  There we read this.
[2045.22 --> 2050.40]  The next day Peter started out with them, and some of the believers from Joppa went along.
[2051.22 --> 2053.62]  The following day he arrived in Caesarea.
[2054.24 --> 2058.04]  Cornelius was expecting him and had called together his relatives and close friends.
[2058.04 --> 2063.80]  As Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence.
[2064.16 --> 2065.30]  But Peter made him get up.
[2065.74 --> 2066.64]  Stand up, he said.
[2066.68 --> 2067.80]  I'm only a man myself.
[2068.84 --> 2072.72]  While talking with him, Peter went inside and found a large gathering of people.
[2073.00 --> 2073.66]  He said to them,
[2073.66 --> 2081.08]  You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with or visit a Gentile.
[2081.74 --> 2085.66]  But God has shown me that I should not call anyone impure or unclean.
[2085.84 --> 2089.22]  So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection.
[2090.14 --> 2093.02]  May I ask why you sent for me?
[2094.30 --> 2095.20]  Cornelius answered,
[2095.20 --> 2098.24]  Three days ago I was in my house praying at this hour.
[2098.60 --> 2105.08]  At three in the afternoon, suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me and said,
[2105.62 --> 2109.94]  Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor.
[2110.54 --> 2112.84]  Send to Joppa for Simon who was called Peter.
[2113.18 --> 2116.66]  He is a guest in the home of Simon the Tanner who lives by the sea.
[2117.38 --> 2119.88]  So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come.
[2119.88 --> 2125.48]  Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us.
[2126.64 --> 2128.76]  Then Peter began to speak.
[2129.92 --> 2134.90]  I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism,
[2135.20 --> 2138.66]  but accepts from every nation the one who fears him and does what is right.
[2138.92 --> 2141.60]  You know the message God sent to the people of Israel,
[2141.92 --> 2145.70]  announcing the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is the Lord of all.
[2145.70 --> 2148.78]  You know what has happened throughout the province of Judea,
[2149.16 --> 2152.18]  beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached,
[2153.08 --> 2156.56]  how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power,
[2156.96 --> 2161.84]  and how he went along doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil
[2161.84 --> 2163.88]  because God was with him.
[2164.94 --> 2169.06]  We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem.
[2169.26 --> 2171.20]  They killed him by hanging him on a cross,
[2171.20 --> 2175.32]  but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen.
[2175.70 --> 2180.92]  He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen,
[2181.30 --> 2184.18]  by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.
[2184.88 --> 2190.70]  He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed
[2190.70 --> 2192.02]  as judge of the living and the dead.
[2192.42 --> 2194.36]  All the prophets testify about him,
[2194.60 --> 2198.88]  that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.
[2198.88 --> 2201.36]  While Peter was still speaking these words,
[2201.48 --> 2203.82]  the Holy Spirit came down on all who heard the message.
[2204.16 --> 2207.78]  The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished
[2207.78 --> 2214.70]  that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on Gentiles,
[2215.58 --> 2219.76]  for they had heard them speaking in tongues and praising God.
[2219.76 --> 2222.04]  Then Peter said,
[2222.04 --> 2227.92]  Surely no one can stand in the way of their being baptized with water.
[2228.34 --> 2231.68]  They have received the Holy Spirit just like we have.
[2232.42 --> 2235.38]  So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2235.96 --> 2238.56]  Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.
[2239.04 --> 2240.12]  The word of the Lord.
[2240.12 --> 2245.40]  Now, kids here today, as always,
[2245.88 --> 2250.66]  if you want to draw a picture of something that has to do with what I'm saying up here,
[2250.70 --> 2252.54]  that has to do with the sermon, please go for it
[2252.54 --> 2256.10]  and hand it in to myself or Pastor Chris afterwards
[2256.10 --> 2258.44]  because he is starting a bit of a collection.
[2259.04 --> 2260.06]  And I haven't told him this yet,
[2260.10 --> 2261.88]  but I'm going to encourage him at the end of the summer
[2261.88 --> 2265.94]  to make some sort of a presentation or a video of all the pictures he receives.
[2266.12 --> 2268.48]  But he needs to get quite a few for that to be any good.
[2268.48 --> 2271.98]  So please write those up and you can give them to me if you can.
[2272.04 --> 2277.24]  As a hint, today's sermon is going to be about how Christians all over the world
[2277.24 --> 2280.04]  worship God together
[2280.04 --> 2283.00]  and how we are all united because of Jesus.
[2283.42 --> 2283.60]  All right?
[2283.64 --> 2285.50]  So please keep listening, but that's a gist.
[2286.20 --> 2288.82]  For you non-kids out there who stopped listening for a paragraph,
[2289.30 --> 2292.06]  in other words, the big idea is this,
[2293.12 --> 2296.66]  that God's love breaks down dividing barriers,
[2296.66 --> 2299.96]  creating a new unity as God's people.
[2300.28 --> 2303.34]  That God's love breaks down dividing barriers,
[2303.72 --> 2306.66]  creating a new unity, there's a tongue twister,
[2306.96 --> 2308.72]  as God's people.
[2309.50 --> 2309.72]  All right?
[2309.76 --> 2310.86]  So let's dig into this text.
[2311.22 --> 2313.04]  Now, the events leading up to this passage,
[2313.14 --> 2314.32]  like I summed up in one sentence,
[2314.38 --> 2315.26]  they're very fascinating.
[2315.80 --> 2316.06]  All right?
[2316.06 --> 2319.46]  The first 22 and a half verses of Acts 10
[2319.46 --> 2321.06]  tell us that Cornelius,
[2321.48 --> 2323.06]  this Gentile Roman centurion,
[2323.74 --> 2325.10]  he's not a Jew, that's important,
[2325.54 --> 2326.30]  he's praying.
[2326.80 --> 2329.40]  When he gets a vision of an angel
[2329.40 --> 2331.58]  who tells him that his prayers have been heard by God,
[2332.86 --> 2334.26]  and that angel tells Cornelius
[2334.26 --> 2335.92]  to send for Simon Peter,
[2336.02 --> 2336.76]  who is in Joppa,
[2337.16 --> 2338.08]  to come to him.
[2338.74 --> 2340.32]  Meanwhile, while that's happening,
[2340.44 --> 2341.12]  in Joppa,
[2341.54 --> 2343.24]  Peter goes up on the roof to pray,
[2343.24 --> 2346.32]  and he falls into a bit of a trance himself,
[2346.48 --> 2347.74]  and he sees a vision as well.
[2347.96 --> 2351.22]  He sees this large sheet come down from heaven,
[2351.54 --> 2353.88]  and it's filled with a bunch of different animals,
[2354.00 --> 2356.18]  a bunch of reptiles and a bunch of birds,
[2356.28 --> 2358.06]  and this voice from heaven says to Peter,
[2358.78 --> 2359.64]  kill and eat.
[2361.10 --> 2361.96]  But Peter refuses.
[2363.10 --> 2364.80]  He says the animals are unclean
[2364.80 --> 2366.02]  according to the Jewish law,
[2366.02 --> 2367.98]  but the voice then responds and says,
[2368.54 --> 2370.86]  do not call anything impure
[2370.86 --> 2372.66]  that God has made clean.
[2374.24 --> 2375.18]  Now, admittedly,
[2375.24 --> 2376.38]  if you read that part of the text,
[2376.50 --> 2377.96]  Peter's downright confused.
[2378.78 --> 2380.84]  But immediately after the vision,
[2380.96 --> 2382.28]  he's informed by the Holy Spirit
[2382.28 --> 2383.50]  that there are three men
[2383.50 --> 2385.30]  that are seeking him at his door.
[2385.90 --> 2387.30]  And these three men are the men
[2387.30 --> 2388.46]  that Cornelius has sent.
[2388.54 --> 2389.28]  And so they arrive,
[2389.36 --> 2391.42]  and Peter goes to accompany them
[2391.42 --> 2393.18]  to Cornelius' house.
[2393.72 --> 2396.20]  We then read our passage that we read today
[2396.20 --> 2397.76]  about how Peter,
[2397.88 --> 2398.68]  through the work of the Spirit,
[2398.84 --> 2400.22]  realizes that Gentiles
[2400.22 --> 2402.70]  are a part of God's kingdom as well.
[2403.24 --> 2404.58]  There's some very cool,
[2404.96 --> 2406.82]  but a little bit of strange things happening here.
[2406.90 --> 2408.10]  So what's with the animal vision?
[2408.34 --> 2409.72]  Why is it centered on food?
[2409.90 --> 2411.78]  And why is Peter so initially confused
[2411.78 --> 2412.90]  about what's going on here?
[2413.94 --> 2415.58]  Well, it's important for us to remember
[2415.58 --> 2417.60]  that God's people were commanded
[2417.60 --> 2418.62]  in the Old Testament
[2418.62 --> 2421.24]  not to eat any of the animals
[2421.24 --> 2422.46]  that Peter saw in that vision.
[2423.10 --> 2425.04]  And it's not just like kind of mentioned.
[2425.28 --> 2427.24]  If you read all of Leviticus 11,
[2427.40 --> 2428.44]  it's a long chapter,
[2428.64 --> 2430.06]  the whole chapter is about that.
[2430.06 --> 2431.78]  And if you read Deuteronomy 14,
[2432.10 --> 2433.48]  three-quarters of that chapter
[2433.48 --> 2434.28]  are about this as well.
[2434.50 --> 2435.66]  There's 68 verses
[2435.66 --> 2437.14]  in those two chapters alone
[2437.14 --> 2438.94]  explaining that God's people
[2438.94 --> 2440.58]  aren't allowed to eat things like camels
[2440.58 --> 2441.72]  or rock badgers
[2441.72 --> 2442.54]  or shellfish
[2442.54 --> 2443.32]  or rats
[2443.32 --> 2444.14]  or weasels
[2444.14 --> 2444.74]  or geckos
[2444.74 --> 2445.26]  or vultures
[2445.26 --> 2445.74]  or rabbits
[2445.74 --> 2446.48]  or chameleons
[2446.48 --> 2448.02]  or any kind of owl
[2448.02 --> 2448.80]  that you can think of.
[2448.84 --> 2449.88]  There's a bunch listed there.
[2450.10 --> 2451.32]  And even pigs,
[2451.56 --> 2452.60]  along with a ton of others.
[2453.72 --> 2454.82]  The point is,
[2455.36 --> 2456.08]  the Old Testament
[2456.08 --> 2457.16]  it's very clear
[2457.16 --> 2458.58]  that they were not allowed
[2458.58 --> 2459.42]  to eat those animals.
[2462.36 --> 2464.14]  Now these laws were given
[2464.14 --> 2465.96]  to define God's people.
[2467.26 --> 2467.46]  All right?
[2467.50 --> 2468.18]  In the Old Testament
[2468.18 --> 2469.12]  these laws were given
[2469.12 --> 2470.84]  to set God's people apart
[2470.84 --> 2471.96]  from the surrounding nations.
[2472.32 --> 2473.22]  God had called them
[2473.22 --> 2474.08]  to be different
[2474.08 --> 2475.28]  from the surrounding nations.
[2475.80 --> 2477.10]  Defined differently.
[2477.50 --> 2478.74]  They were not to worship idols.
[2479.26 --> 2480.38]  They were not to sacrifice
[2480.38 --> 2481.20]  their children
[2481.20 --> 2482.70]  to the false gods around them.
[2482.96 --> 2483.78]  They were not to work
[2483.78 --> 2484.36]  on the Sabbath
[2484.36 --> 2485.60]  and they were not to eat
[2485.60 --> 2486.72]  these kinds of animals.
[2488.24 --> 2489.80]  Peter was Jewish
[2489.80 --> 2491.54]  and these laws
[2491.54 --> 2493.08]  were a part of who he was.
[2493.88 --> 2494.86]  It helped him.
[2495.00 --> 2496.14]  It helped form his identity.
[2496.32 --> 2497.00]  It rooted him
[2497.00 --> 2497.92]  in his heritage.
[2498.46 --> 2500.12]  He was proud to be Jewish.
[2500.86 --> 2501.56]  He was proud
[2501.56 --> 2502.82]  to uphold these laws
[2502.82 --> 2504.26]  that were laid out from him
[2504.26 --> 2506.60]  generations upon generations ago.
[2508.10 --> 2509.46]  So having a vision
[2509.46 --> 2511.02]  telling him to kill
[2511.02 --> 2512.26]  and eat those animals
[2512.26 --> 2513.40]  would have graded
[2513.40 --> 2514.42]  against the very core
[2514.42 --> 2515.20]  of who he was.
[2517.38 --> 2518.40]  It would have graded
[2518.40 --> 2519.22]  against his heritage.
[2519.44 --> 2520.20]  It would have graded
[2520.20 --> 2521.46]  against his traditions,
[2521.60 --> 2522.10]  his values.
[2522.20 --> 2522.68]  This would have been
[2522.68 --> 2524.22]  a very difficult thing
[2524.22 --> 2525.86]  for Peter to wrap his head around.
[2528.94 --> 2530.10]  But the problem was
[2530.10 --> 2531.10]  while these laws
[2531.66 --> 2532.48]  were implemented
[2532.48 --> 2534.06]  in Old Testament Israel
[2534.06 --> 2535.72]  to define God's people,
[2536.62 --> 2537.50]  what was happening
[2537.50 --> 2538.78]  was these same laws
[2538.78 --> 2539.26]  were starting
[2539.26 --> 2540.58]  to divide God's people.
[2540.58 --> 2543.60]  The defining things
[2543.60 --> 2544.04]  were turning
[2544.04 --> 2545.40]  into dividing things.
[2546.64 --> 2547.72]  Those laws
[2547.72 --> 2548.88]  were implemented
[2548.88 --> 2550.16]  to keep God's people
[2550.16 --> 2550.60]  humble
[2550.60 --> 2552.08]  and focused on him
[2552.08 --> 2553.00]  and separate
[2553.00 --> 2555.90]  from the nations
[2555.90 --> 2556.70]  around him.
[2556.76 --> 2558.14]  But there was a humility
[2558.14 --> 2559.72]  intended by those laws
[2559.72 --> 2560.92]  that God set
[2560.92 --> 2561.76]  those people apart.
[2562.76 --> 2564.38]  But as history unfolded,
[2564.54 --> 2566.12]  what was meant
[2566.12 --> 2567.06]  to help people
[2567.06 --> 2568.10]  humbly follow
[2568.10 --> 2570.00]  turned into something
[2570.00 --> 2570.56]  that people
[2570.56 --> 2571.94]  pridefully flaunted.
[2573.28 --> 2574.18]  And so humility
[2574.18 --> 2575.62]  intended to set
[2575.62 --> 2576.64]  God's people apart
[2576.64 --> 2578.24]  turned into a pride
[2578.24 --> 2579.48]  which set
[2579.48 --> 2580.52]  God's people
[2580.52 --> 2581.16]  against.
[2583.24 --> 2584.34]  Now Jesus saw
[2584.34 --> 2584.88]  this happening
[2584.88 --> 2585.26]  as well
[2585.26 --> 2585.96]  in his ministry.
[2586.10 --> 2586.90]  In Matthew 15,
[2587.28 --> 2588.62]  if you turn to that now,
[2588.70 --> 2589.20]  the Pharisees
[2589.20 --> 2590.04]  accuse him
[2590.04 --> 2590.62]  and the disciples
[2590.62 --> 2591.96]  of not following
[2591.96 --> 2592.86]  the Mosaic law.
[2593.26 --> 2593.88]  And he responds
[2593.88 --> 2595.12]  in Matthew 15
[2595.12 --> 2595.92]  verses 10 and 11
[2595.92 --> 2596.42]  by saying,
[2596.84 --> 2597.78]  listen and understand.
[2598.82 --> 2599.68]  What goes into
[2599.68 --> 2600.40]  someone's mouth
[2600.40 --> 2601.82]  does not defile him,
[2602.06 --> 2603.26]  but what comes out
[2603.26 --> 2604.02]  of their mouth,
[2604.28 --> 2605.58]  that is what
[2605.58 --> 2606.38]  defiles them.
[2607.74 --> 2608.42]  See, the shift
[2608.42 --> 2609.36]  was happening already
[2609.36 --> 2610.06]  with Jesus
[2610.06 --> 2611.58]  and now it's trickled
[2611.58 --> 2612.26]  down to Peter.
[2613.58 --> 2614.34]  Now this matters
[2614.34 --> 2615.14]  because this whole
[2615.14 --> 2616.32]  conversation is centered
[2616.32 --> 2616.82]  on food,
[2617.10 --> 2617.76]  but what our text
[2617.76 --> 2619.00]  today is actually about
[2619.00 --> 2620.50]  is the kingdom of God.
[2621.08 --> 2622.62]  Who is allowed
[2622.62 --> 2623.68]  to sit at the table?
[2624.52 --> 2625.46]  Who can be a part
[2625.46 --> 2626.26]  of God's people?
[2626.26 --> 2629.86]  What once was defined
[2629.86 --> 2630.70]  by borders
[2630.70 --> 2631.50]  was now,
[2631.68 --> 2632.16]  through Christ,
[2632.52 --> 2633.88]  defined by belief.
[2635.06 --> 2636.68]  The new defining thing
[2636.68 --> 2638.54]  was not the culinary rules
[2638.54 --> 2639.38]  that were set out for you,
[2639.42 --> 2640.54]  but the understanding
[2640.54 --> 2641.26]  that you are
[2641.26 --> 2642.36]  in desperate need
[2642.36 --> 2643.42]  of the death
[2643.42 --> 2644.42]  or the life
[2644.42 --> 2644.90]  and the death
[2644.90 --> 2645.52]  and the resurrection
[2645.52 --> 2646.48]  of Jesus Christ.
[2646.48 --> 2650.66]  to the story again.
[2650.74 --> 2651.24]  Peter, though,
[2651.32 --> 2652.40]  after a lot of confusion,
[2652.52 --> 2653.34]  to his credit,
[2654.28 --> 2655.32]  he goes along
[2655.32 --> 2656.06]  with the Holy Spirit.
[2656.18 --> 2656.76]  He follows
[2656.76 --> 2658.50]  what he is being led to
[2658.50 --> 2659.08]  and he is able
[2659.08 --> 2660.22]  to realize this
[2660.22 --> 2661.04]  in our text today
[2661.04 --> 2661.52]  when he says
[2661.52 --> 2662.92]  in verses 34 and 35,
[2663.04 --> 2663.54]  he says this,
[2663.88 --> 2664.14]  he says,
[2664.22 --> 2665.52]  I now realize
[2665.52 --> 2666.84]  how true it is
[2666.84 --> 2668.08]  that God does not
[2668.08 --> 2668.98]  show favoritism,
[2669.66 --> 2670.42]  but accepts
[2670.42 --> 2671.38]  from every nation
[2671.38 --> 2672.60]  the one who fears him
[2672.60 --> 2673.42]  and does what is right.
[2673.42 --> 2675.54]  And he follows that up
[2675.54 --> 2676.26]  a little bit later
[2676.26 --> 2677.24]  in verse 43
[2677.24 --> 2678.00]  with the words,
[2678.58 --> 2679.12]  everyone,
[2680.14 --> 2680.72]  everyone
[2680.72 --> 2682.66]  who believes in him
[2682.66 --> 2683.40]  receives forgiveness
[2683.40 --> 2684.70]  of sins
[2684.70 --> 2685.72]  through his name.
[2687.64 --> 2689.38]  A Gentile like Cornelius
[2689.38 --> 2690.18]  was now welcome
[2690.18 --> 2691.10]  into the fold.
[2691.68 --> 2693.06]  God's covenant children
[2693.06 --> 2693.82]  now expanded
[2693.82 --> 2695.56]  beyond the Jewish people,
[2695.68 --> 2696.86]  beyond traditions,
[2697.28 --> 2698.58]  defining markers
[2698.58 --> 2700.92]  were redrawn
[2700.92 --> 2701.78]  and all nations
[2701.78 --> 2702.60]  were being welcomed
[2702.60 --> 2703.74]  into the mix.
[2704.04 --> 2704.98]  This is one
[2704.98 --> 2706.34]  of the primary stories
[2706.34 --> 2707.28]  of the kingdom of God
[2707.28 --> 2708.28]  expanding beyond
[2708.28 --> 2709.92]  the people of Israel.
[2710.82 --> 2711.52]  But the story
[2711.52 --> 2712.20]  in Acts 10
[2712.20 --> 2713.92]  is just a microcosm
[2713.92 --> 2714.64]  of what's to come.
[2715.92 --> 2716.94]  Five chapters later
[2716.94 --> 2717.84]  in Exodus 15,
[2718.08 --> 2718.72]  we hear another
[2718.72 --> 2719.60]  beautiful story
[2719.60 --> 2720.70]  of the unity found
[2720.70 --> 2721.70]  in the diversity
[2721.70 --> 2722.72]  of the body of Christ.
[2723.04 --> 2723.58]  I encourage you
[2723.58 --> 2724.44]  to read it this week.
[2724.52 --> 2725.10]  Acts 15,
[2725.20 --> 2725.96]  read the whole chapter.
[2726.28 --> 2727.30]  I'll summarize it for now.
[2727.66 --> 2728.38]  In Acts 15,
[2728.48 --> 2729.12]  the early church,
[2729.22 --> 2729.86]  they were once again
[2729.86 --> 2730.44]  debating
[2730.44 --> 2732.28]  whether Gentiles
[2732.28 --> 2733.22]  needed to follow
[2733.22 --> 2734.24]  Jewish customs
[2734.24 --> 2735.92]  in order to be included
[2735.92 --> 2736.78]  with God's people.
[2737.16 --> 2737.86]  Except this time
[2737.86 --> 2739.52]  the debate wasn't on food,
[2739.84 --> 2740.90]  it was on circumcision.
[2741.70 --> 2742.58]  Some argued
[2742.58 --> 2743.62]  that Gentiles
[2743.62 --> 2744.88]  must be circumcised
[2744.88 --> 2745.58]  to be saved,
[2745.90 --> 2746.40]  which caused
[2746.40 --> 2747.36]  a little bit of a stir
[2747.36 --> 2748.60]  for the Gentile men.
[2748.88 --> 2750.46]  I think we can all understand
[2750.46 --> 2751.36]  why that would be true.
[2752.72 --> 2753.84]  Well, Paul and Barnabas,
[2754.00 --> 2755.52]  they were sent to Jerusalem
[2755.52 --> 2756.18]  to consult
[2756.18 --> 2756.92]  with the apostles
[2756.92 --> 2757.64]  and the elders.
[2757.78 --> 2759.42]  People like James
[2759.42 --> 2760.02]  and Peter
[2760.02 --> 2761.14]  were there as well.
[2761.94 --> 2762.40]  And so you've got
[2762.40 --> 2763.50]  James and Peter
[2763.50 --> 2765.30]  and Paul and Barnabas
[2765.30 --> 2766.54]  to be a fly on the wall
[2766.54 --> 2767.08]  of that room
[2767.08 --> 2768.06]  would have been fascinating.
[2768.96 --> 2769.22]  There,
[2769.30 --> 2770.70]  after a bunch of discussion
[2770.70 --> 2771.60]  in verse 15,
[2772.04 --> 2772.72]  Peter speaks,
[2773.00 --> 2774.14]  no doubt remembering
[2774.14 --> 2775.06]  what had just happened
[2775.06 --> 2776.38]  with him at Cornelius' house
[2776.38 --> 2778.24]  five chapters earlier,
[2778.44 --> 2779.60]  and he emphasizes
[2779.60 --> 2780.82]  that God shows
[2780.82 --> 2781.52]  no distinction
[2781.52 --> 2782.76]  between Jews and Gentiles.
[2782.98 --> 2784.16]  He gives the Holy Spirit
[2784.16 --> 2784.64]  to both.
[2784.64 --> 2786.50]  He argued that salvation
[2786.50 --> 2787.42]  is through the grace
[2787.42 --> 2788.78]  of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2788.78 --> 2790.10]  and not through the law.
[2791.28 --> 2792.34]  James supported this
[2792.34 --> 2793.04]  as well from Peter,
[2793.12 --> 2793.82]  and he actually quotes
[2793.82 --> 2795.24]  Amos 9 by saying,
[2795.64 --> 2796.54]  the rest of mankind
[2796.54 --> 2797.70]  may seek the Lord,
[2798.12 --> 2799.86]  even all the Gentiles
[2799.86 --> 2801.48]  who bear God's name.
[2802.74 --> 2804.04]  So this council then,
[2804.14 --> 2805.04]  after debating this
[2805.04 --> 2805.50]  for a while,
[2805.80 --> 2806.50]  decides that,
[2806.58 --> 2806.66]  yeah,
[2806.74 --> 2807.80]  the Gentiles don't need
[2807.80 --> 2808.74]  to be circumcised,
[2809.20 --> 2810.88]  but there are some things
[2810.88 --> 2811.56]  they do need to do.
[2811.62 --> 2812.48]  They need to abstain
[2812.48 --> 2814.06]  from sexual immorality,
[2814.06 --> 2815.32]  and other forms
[2815.32 --> 2816.18]  of idolatry.
[2816.76 --> 2817.24]  In other words,
[2817.32 --> 2818.76]  the things that defined them
[2818.76 --> 2819.36]  were changing,
[2820.16 --> 2821.14]  but there was still
[2821.14 --> 2821.98]  this bar of holiness
[2821.98 --> 2822.62]  that we were called
[2822.62 --> 2824.46]  to live and strive towards.
[2825.54 --> 2826.56]  Now, this decision
[2826.56 --> 2827.82]  was met with a ton
[2827.82 --> 2828.40]  of encouragement
[2828.40 --> 2829.88]  and joy by the early church,
[2830.00 --> 2830.66]  and it marked
[2830.66 --> 2831.90]  another pivotal moment
[2831.90 --> 2832.90]  in the early church,
[2833.30 --> 2834.54]  affirming that Gentiles
[2834.54 --> 2835.78]  were now fully part
[2835.78 --> 2836.84]  of the Christian community
[2836.84 --> 2837.76]  without needing
[2837.76 --> 2838.46]  to adopt all
[2838.46 --> 2839.50]  of the Jewish customs
[2839.50 --> 2840.86]  like circumcision
[2840.86 --> 2842.12]  or not eating bacon.
[2845.04 --> 2846.68]  So there's two stories,
[2847.22 --> 2849.06]  five chapters apart
[2849.06 --> 2849.68]  in Acts,
[2850.04 --> 2851.22]  about how being a part
[2851.22 --> 2852.02]  of God's kingdom
[2852.02 --> 2853.16]  is not about
[2853.16 --> 2854.90]  the full sort of burden
[2854.90 --> 2856.32]  of the Mosaic law,
[2856.76 --> 2857.92]  but about abstaining
[2857.92 --> 2858.78]  from idolatry
[2858.78 --> 2860.60]  and worshiping God alone.
[2860.70 --> 2861.44]  No matter what
[2861.44 --> 2862.80]  your nationality,
[2862.92 --> 2863.50]  if you want to use
[2863.50 --> 2863.94]  that word,
[2865.28 --> 2866.46]  unity was now centered
[2866.46 --> 2867.24]  on one truth,
[2868.02 --> 2868.70]  that Jesus,
[2869.24 --> 2869.80]  the Redeemer,
[2869.94 --> 2871.70]  Savior for all,
[2873.36 --> 2874.10]  needs to be a part
[2874.10 --> 2874.68]  of our lives
[2874.68 --> 2876.24]  and that God alone
[2876.24 --> 2877.34]  is to be worshiped.
[2879.20 --> 2880.64]  So in light of all of that,
[2880.88 --> 2882.32]  in light of those two stories,
[2883.00 --> 2884.32]  I'd like to suggest
[2884.32 --> 2885.06]  three things
[2885.06 --> 2886.12]  that we can take from this.
[2886.90 --> 2887.84]  The first is this,
[2888.16 --> 2890.06]  that unity is rooted
[2890.06 --> 2891.62]  in Jesus Christ.
[2892.52 --> 2892.68]  All right,
[2892.72 --> 2894.00]  the early church debated
[2894.00 --> 2895.86]  what the unifying measures
[2895.86 --> 2896.74]  of church were
[2896.74 --> 2897.90]  and when they focused
[2897.90 --> 2899.84]  on laws or customs,
[2899.94 --> 2901.10]  such as what food
[2901.10 --> 2901.98]  people had to eat
[2901.98 --> 2903.38]  or how much of their manhood
[2903.38 --> 2904.38]  needed to be lopped off,
[2904.44 --> 2905.72]  there started to become arguments.
[2907.34 --> 2908.52]  Now, it's not the rules,
[2908.72 --> 2909.18]  regulations,
[2909.32 --> 2909.98]  or traditions
[2909.98 --> 2911.10]  that we keep
[2911.10 --> 2911.84]  that unite us
[2911.84 --> 2912.62]  as God's people,
[2912.80 --> 2913.40]  but the fact
[2913.40 --> 2914.30]  that we are united
[2914.30 --> 2916.30]  in Christ that does.
[2917.40 --> 2918.28]  Now, please hear this.
[2918.34 --> 2919.32]  In the words
[2919.32 --> 2920.86]  of a wise pastor
[2920.86 --> 2922.16]  that I know pretty well,
[2922.16 --> 2924.68]  don't hear
[2924.68 --> 2926.08]  what I'm not saying.
[2927.70 --> 2929.36]  I am not saying
[2929.36 --> 2930.86]  that all the rules
[2930.86 --> 2931.92]  are now abolished
[2931.92 --> 2932.94]  and that there are
[2932.94 --> 2933.74]  no laws
[2933.74 --> 2934.66]  that we must follow.
[2935.16 --> 2936.14]  The story we read
[2936.14 --> 2936.84]  in Acts 15
[2936.84 --> 2937.64]  spells this out
[2937.64 --> 2938.40]  very clearly,
[2938.76 --> 2939.70]  that all believers,
[2939.82 --> 2940.48]  no matter if they were
[2940.48 --> 2941.42]  Jew or Gentile,
[2941.68 --> 2942.38]  they're still called
[2942.38 --> 2943.80]  to abstain from idolatry.
[2944.02 --> 2944.72]  They're still called
[2944.72 --> 2945.46]  to abstain from
[2945.46 --> 2946.38]  sexual immorality.
[2946.68 --> 2947.26]  It's not that there's
[2947.26 --> 2948.62]  no bar of holiness anymore.
[2948.62 --> 2950.62]  It's just that
[2950.62 --> 2952.22]  the customs that once
[2952.22 --> 2953.66]  defined God's people
[2953.66 --> 2955.52]  are no longer
[2955.52 --> 2956.70]  defining God's people.
[2957.80 --> 2959.00]  Instead, it's Jesus
[2959.00 --> 2960.68]  who defines God's people.
[2961.02 --> 2961.78]  Unity comes
[2961.78 --> 2963.20]  when we as God's people
[2963.20 --> 2964.46]  are grafted
[2964.46 --> 2964.98]  and planted
[2964.98 --> 2965.52]  and rooted
[2965.52 --> 2966.72]  in the gospel truth
[2966.72 --> 2967.52]  of Jesus Christ.
[2969.30 --> 2970.28]  There's a quote
[2970.28 --> 2974.08]  from an early church father
[2974.08 --> 2975.48]  named Siberian.
[2976.24 --> 2977.02]  He was born
[2977.02 --> 2978.50]  and he lived in North Africa
[2978.50 --> 2979.10]  in the beginning
[2979.10 --> 2979.98]  of the third century.
[2980.10 --> 2980.66]  So this is like,
[2980.72 --> 2981.70]  this is a pretty old quote.
[2982.24 --> 2983.36]  And this quote
[2983.36 --> 2984.58]  paints just this
[2984.58 --> 2985.54]  beautiful picture
[2985.54 --> 2987.78]  of what being believers
[2987.78 --> 2989.34]  across the globe,
[2989.50 --> 2990.48]  united everywhere means.
[2991.42 --> 2992.72]  It's not the practices
[2992.72 --> 2993.56]  that we perform
[2993.56 --> 2994.24]  or the heritage
[2994.24 --> 2994.96]  that we have,
[2995.02 --> 2996.14]  but it's the Savior
[2996.14 --> 2997.24]  that we are all rooted in.
[2997.58 --> 2998.74]  The quote's a little bit long,
[2999.00 --> 2999.66]  but it's too good
[2999.66 --> 3000.44]  not to read the whole thing.
[3000.60 --> 3001.84]  So it'll be on the screen
[3001.84 --> 3002.28]  behind me.
[3002.58 --> 3003.50]  Siberian says this,
[3004.08 --> 3005.72]  the church also is one
[3005.72 --> 3007.46]  which is spread abroad
[3007.46 --> 3008.70]  far and wide
[3008.70 --> 3009.72]  into a multitude
[3009.72 --> 3011.10]  by an increase
[3011.10 --> 3011.80]  of fruitfulness.
[3012.52 --> 3013.76]  As there are many rays
[3013.76 --> 3014.30]  of the sun
[3014.30 --> 3014.98]  but one light
[3014.98 --> 3016.16]  and many branches
[3016.16 --> 3016.72]  of a tree
[3016.72 --> 3017.64]  but one strength
[3017.64 --> 3019.56]  based in its tenacious root.
[3020.14 --> 3021.58]  And since from one spring
[3021.58 --> 3023.06]  flow many streams,
[3023.60 --> 3024.62]  although the multiplicity
[3024.62 --> 3025.42]  seems diffused
[3025.42 --> 3026.22]  in the liberality
[3026.22 --> 3027.80]  of an overflowing abundance,
[3028.94 --> 3029.66]  yet the unity
[3029.66 --> 3031.00]  is still preserved
[3031.00 --> 3031.84]  in the source.
[3033.32 --> 3034.08]  Separate a ray
[3034.08 --> 3034.70]  from the sun
[3034.70 --> 3035.76]  and its body of light,
[3036.04 --> 3036.52]  its unity
[3036.52 --> 3037.32]  does not allow
[3037.32 --> 3038.24]  a division of light.
[3038.46 --> 3039.20]  Break a branch
[3039.20 --> 3039.76]  from a tree
[3039.76 --> 3040.36]  when broken,
[3040.72 --> 3041.52]  it will not be able
[3041.52 --> 3041.94]  to bud.
[3042.54 --> 3043.50]  Cut off the stream
[3043.50 --> 3044.30]  from its fountain
[3044.30 --> 3045.72]  and that which is cut off
[3045.72 --> 3046.24]  dries up.
[3047.36 --> 3048.86]  Thus is also the church,
[3049.60 --> 3050.42]  shone over
[3050.42 --> 3051.04]  with the light
[3051.04 --> 3051.56]  of the Lord,
[3051.98 --> 3053.18]  sheds forth her rays
[3053.18 --> 3054.20]  over the whole world,
[3055.12 --> 3056.84]  yet is one light
[3056.84 --> 3058.50]  which is everywhere diffused.
[3059.22 --> 3060.12]  Nor is the unity
[3060.12 --> 3060.90]  of the body
[3060.90 --> 3061.68]  separated.
[3061.68 --> 3063.96]  Her fruitful abundance
[3063.96 --> 3065.36]  spreads her branches
[3065.36 --> 3066.24]  over the whole world.
[3066.38 --> 3068.04]  She broadly expands
[3068.04 --> 3068.56]  her rivers,
[3068.98 --> 3070.00]  liberally flowing,
[3070.60 --> 3071.46]  yet her head is one,
[3071.98 --> 3073.62]  her source is one,
[3073.74 --> 3074.78]  and she is one mother
[3074.78 --> 3076.22]  plentiful in the results
[3076.22 --> 3076.88]  of fruitfulness.
[3077.44 --> 3078.12]  From her womb
[3078.12 --> 3078.78]  we are born,
[3078.90 --> 3079.50]  by her milk
[3079.50 --> 3080.14]  we are nourished,
[3080.30 --> 3081.08]  by her spirit
[3081.08 --> 3082.08]  we are animated.
[3085.04 --> 3085.84]  As believers,
[3086.00 --> 3087.06]  we cannot be separated
[3087.06 --> 3087.82]  from Jesus,
[3088.02 --> 3088.90]  the source of life.
[3088.96 --> 3089.70]  It is Jesus
[3089.70 --> 3091.36]  who unites us.
[3091.36 --> 3092.56]  It is the reality
[3092.56 --> 3093.48]  that Jesus lived
[3093.48 --> 3094.54]  a perfect life
[3094.54 --> 3095.24]  that you and I
[3095.24 --> 3096.54]  have failed to live
[3096.54 --> 3097.42]  and the reality
[3097.42 --> 3098.90]  that he died a death
[3098.90 --> 3099.90]  that you and I
[3099.90 --> 3101.34]  deserve to die,
[3101.92 --> 3102.74]  taking the weight
[3102.74 --> 3103.78]  of sin and misery
[3103.78 --> 3104.46]  on his shoulders
[3104.46 --> 3105.22]  to the grave.
[3106.52 --> 3107.00]  But it's also
[3107.00 --> 3107.64]  the understanding
[3107.64 --> 3108.44]  that after three days
[3108.44 --> 3109.38]  Jesus rose again
[3109.38 --> 3110.34]  from the dead
[3110.34 --> 3111.64]  and after he was witnessed
[3111.64 --> 3113.08]  by about 500 people
[3113.08 --> 3113.60]  or more,
[3113.66 --> 3114.52]  he ascended to heaven
[3114.52 --> 3115.20]  and is now seated
[3115.20 --> 3116.34]  at the right hand
[3116.34 --> 3117.62]  of God the Father
[3117.62 --> 3118.22]  Almighty,
[3118.46 --> 3119.88]  interceding on our behalf.
[3119.88 --> 3121.74]  Now,
[3122.26 --> 3123.26]  his people
[3123.26 --> 3124.80]  are defined
[3124.80 --> 3125.64]  differently.
[3126.52 --> 3127.26]  There is neither
[3127.26 --> 3128.84]  Jew nor Greek,
[3129.22 --> 3129.64]  there is neither
[3129.64 --> 3130.70]  slave nor free,
[3130.82 --> 3131.24]  there is neither
[3131.24 --> 3132.26]  male nor female,
[3132.42 --> 3133.22]  for all
[3133.22 --> 3134.24]  of us
[3134.24 --> 3135.14]  are united
[3135.14 --> 3135.92]  as one
[3135.92 --> 3136.94]  in Christ
[3136.94 --> 3137.70]  Jesus.
[3141.26 --> 3142.24]  Our source
[3142.24 --> 3142.72]  is Jesus.
[3143.82 --> 3144.20]  Unity
[3144.20 --> 3144.72]  is found
[3144.72 --> 3145.16]  in him.
[3145.16 --> 3146.78]  That is why
[3146.78 --> 3147.16]  when Jesus
[3147.16 --> 3147.76]  comes again
[3147.76 --> 3148.10]  we're given
[3148.10 --> 3149.18]  this picture
[3149.18 --> 3149.92]  of eternity
[3149.92 --> 3150.58]  that we read
[3150.58 --> 3151.56]  in Revelation 7
[3151.56 --> 3152.82]  where it says,
[3153.08 --> 3153.62]  after I looked,
[3153.68 --> 3154.68]  this is John's vision
[3154.68 --> 3155.70]  but it's for all of us,
[3155.94 --> 3157.40]  after this I looked
[3157.40 --> 3158.78]  and there before me
[3158.78 --> 3159.70]  was a great multitude
[3159.70 --> 3160.98]  that no one could count
[3160.98 --> 3163.10]  from every nation,
[3163.84 --> 3164.42]  tribe,
[3164.84 --> 3165.26]  people,
[3165.50 --> 3166.34]  and language
[3166.34 --> 3168.10]  standing before the throne
[3168.10 --> 3169.18]  and before the Lamb.
[3169.84 --> 3170.48]  They were wearing
[3170.48 --> 3171.18]  white robes
[3171.18 --> 3171.64]  and were holding
[3171.64 --> 3172.40]  palm branches
[3172.40 --> 3172.92]  in their hand
[3172.92 --> 3173.60]  and they cried out
[3173.60 --> 3174.36]  in a loud voice,
[3174.76 --> 3176.42]  salvation belongs
[3176.42 --> 3177.52]  to our God
[3177.52 --> 3179.02]  who sits on the throne
[3179.02 --> 3180.48]  and to the Lamb.
[3181.68 --> 3181.94]  See,
[3182.34 --> 3183.34]  much like this vision
[3183.34 --> 3184.14]  that Peter had
[3184.14 --> 3184.76]  with the sheep
[3184.76 --> 3185.60]  and the animals
[3185.60 --> 3186.64]  in Acts 10,
[3186.96 --> 3187.96]  Revelation 7
[3187.96 --> 3189.02]  is our vision.
[3190.58 --> 3191.62]  That's the vision
[3191.62 --> 3192.20]  for us.
[3192.98 --> 3193.92]  This positive
[3193.92 --> 3195.04]  theological vision
[3195.04 --> 3195.80]  of life together
[3195.80 --> 3197.08]  is that all people
[3197.08 --> 3198.48]  from every tribe
[3198.48 --> 3199.10]  and nation
[3199.10 --> 3200.00]  and tongue
[3200.00 --> 3201.10]  will join together
[3201.10 --> 3202.34]  and worship God
[3202.34 --> 3203.72]  and that's
[3203.72 --> 3204.56]  the second point
[3204.56 --> 3206.70]  that this unity
[3206.70 --> 3207.24]  in Christ
[3207.24 --> 3208.16]  is for all people,
[3208.76 --> 3209.66]  for all nations.
[3210.48 --> 3210.82]  In Acts,
[3210.90 --> 3211.62]  the story is about
[3211.62 --> 3212.36]  Jew and Gentile
[3212.36 --> 3212.76]  but remember,
[3212.88 --> 3213.52]  Gentile is just
[3213.52 --> 3214.40]  everyone who's not a Jew.
[3215.36 --> 3215.88]  So the story
[3215.88 --> 3216.58]  of Jesus' life,
[3216.68 --> 3216.80]  death,
[3216.84 --> 3217.36]  and resurrection
[3217.36 --> 3219.06]  is not an isolated gospel.
[3219.62 --> 3220.12]  It's meant
[3220.12 --> 3220.96]  for all the world.
[3222.54 --> 3223.14]  In Acts 10,
[3223.24 --> 3223.76]  Peter asks,
[3224.02 --> 3224.72]  is this true
[3224.72 --> 3225.58]  for Gentiles?
[3226.14 --> 3226.80]  And he finds out,
[3226.86 --> 3227.52]  yeah, it is.
[3228.14 --> 3229.14]  And then in Acts 15,
[3229.20 --> 3229.70]  they're still kind of
[3229.70 --> 3230.28]  figuring it out.
[3230.34 --> 3230.52]  They're like,
[3230.56 --> 3230.68]  okay,
[3230.72 --> 3231.60]  it's for the Gentiles,
[3231.60 --> 3231.92]  sure,
[3232.28 --> 3232.98]  but they have to be
[3232.98 --> 3233.70]  like us, right?
[3234.72 --> 3235.60]  And then as they discuss,
[3235.70 --> 3236.08]  they conclude,
[3236.16 --> 3236.88]  no, they don't.
[3237.40 --> 3237.68]  Actually,
[3237.76 --> 3238.20]  God's people
[3238.20 --> 3239.28]  are defined differently now.
[3239.82 --> 3240.62]  And then in Revelation
[3240.62 --> 3241.52]  and John's vision,
[3241.82 --> 3242.68]  it highlights for us
[3242.68 --> 3245.50]  that this is for everyone.
[3245.94 --> 3246.82]  We know that salvation
[3246.82 --> 3247.80]  is for every race,
[3248.06 --> 3248.66]  every nation,
[3248.80 --> 3249.32]  every tongue,
[3249.62 --> 3250.38]  every tribe.
[3251.56 --> 3252.60]  Like I said off the top,
[3252.84 --> 3254.54]  I am seeing this in seminary.
[3255.12 --> 3256.34]  It's a beautiful picture.
[3256.46 --> 3257.96]  People from all over the world
[3257.96 --> 3260.12]  studying and worshiping together
[3260.12 --> 3261.76]  and theologizing,
[3261.92 --> 3263.04]  which I learned is a real word,
[3263.14 --> 3263.82]  in seminary,
[3263.94 --> 3264.58]  so it's working.
[3265.62 --> 3267.12]  Being the church of God
[3267.12 --> 3268.70]  in all corners of the world
[3268.70 --> 3269.90]  is happening.
[3270.94 --> 3272.66]  It's a beautiful picture
[3272.66 --> 3273.48]  of God's people
[3273.48 --> 3274.58]  rooted in Christ
[3274.58 --> 3276.28]  from across the globe.
[3279.86 --> 3281.02]  Now, I've heard this said,
[3281.06 --> 3281.84]  and some will say,
[3281.90 --> 3282.98]  that the church is united
[3282.98 --> 3284.60]  despite its diversity.
[3284.60 --> 3286.40]  But it's not true.
[3287.68 --> 3289.02]  No, the church is united
[3289.02 --> 3290.50]  because of its diversity.
[3292.52 --> 3294.30]  And because that's the reality
[3294.30 --> 3294.86]  of the church
[3294.86 --> 3295.38]  that's painted
[3295.38 --> 3296.30]  in the word of God,
[3297.30 --> 3298.68]  churches thrive
[3298.68 --> 3300.08]  when they are made up
[3300.08 --> 3300.76]  of all nations.
[3302.84 --> 3304.06]  So then the question becomes,
[3304.16 --> 3304.80]  what about the church
[3304.80 --> 3305.34]  in Langley
[3305.34 --> 3307.74]  in Canada in 2024?
[3307.90 --> 3308.40]  Or more honed in,
[3308.42 --> 3309.26]  what does it mean for here?
[3309.26 --> 3309.50]  Now,
[3311.90 --> 3313.86]  I'm going to invite you
[3313.86 --> 3315.10]  to bring your guard down
[3315.10 --> 3315.96]  for just a second.
[3316.76 --> 3316.96]  All right?
[3317.00 --> 3317.64]  It's possible
[3317.64 --> 3318.58]  what I'm about to say
[3318.58 --> 3319.64]  might bristle a touch,
[3320.22 --> 3320.80]  but I'm praying
[3320.80 --> 3321.52]  for the Holy Spirit
[3321.52 --> 3322.48]  to massage our hearts
[3322.48 --> 3323.30]  and really hear
[3323.30 --> 3324.56]  what He is trying to say
[3324.56 --> 3325.44]  to us today here.
[3325.62 --> 3326.94]  So just prayerfully
[3326.94 --> 3328.24]  give the following
[3328.24 --> 3328.80]  some thought.
[3329.98 --> 3330.18]  All right?
[3330.22 --> 3331.58]  The CRC as a whole
[3331.58 --> 3332.60]  is often viewed
[3332.60 --> 3333.22]  or described
[3333.22 --> 3334.74]  as a Dutch church.
[3335.36 --> 3336.60]  There's very good reasons
[3336.60 --> 3337.12]  for this.
[3337.12 --> 3338.76]  Because the CRC
[3338.76 --> 3339.52]  in North America
[3339.52 --> 3340.24]  was started
[3340.24 --> 3341.26]  by Dutch immigrants.
[3342.00 --> 3342.46]  Last year,
[3342.50 --> 3344.64]  I took a course CRC history
[3344.64 --> 3345.36]  and the stories
[3345.36 --> 3346.28]  of the Dutch immigrants
[3346.28 --> 3347.40]  and how they started
[3347.40 --> 3348.46]  this church are amazing.
[3348.58 --> 3349.28]  It's fascinating.
[3349.38 --> 3350.46]  The history is worth
[3350.46 --> 3351.52]  digging into.
[3351.66 --> 3353.12]  People like Van Ralt
[3353.12 --> 3354.04]  and Hahn
[3354.04 --> 3354.96]  and Boer
[3354.96 --> 3355.90]  and many others
[3355.90 --> 3357.34]  did some amazing things.
[3358.52 --> 3359.56]  And we can remember
[3359.56 --> 3360.74]  and celebrate
[3360.74 --> 3361.82]  our history
[3361.82 --> 3363.28]  and what defined
[3363.28 --> 3364.40]  the denomination.
[3364.40 --> 3367.08]  but remember
[3367.08 --> 3368.64]  what defines us,
[3368.80 --> 3369.64]  what we celebrate
[3369.64 --> 3371.06]  that defines us
[3371.06 --> 3373.32]  cannot divide us.
[3374.50 --> 3375.14]  So yes,
[3375.26 --> 3376.26]  the history of the CRC
[3376.26 --> 3376.68]  was started
[3376.68 --> 3377.50]  by Dutch immigrants
[3377.50 --> 3379.32]  but we're not
[3379.32 --> 3380.20]  a Dutch church.
[3381.66 --> 3383.18]  We are the church.
[3383.96 --> 3385.32]  The church universal.
[3386.00 --> 3386.66]  When we speak
[3386.66 --> 3387.56]  the Apostles' Creed
[3387.56 --> 3388.84]  we say we believe
[3388.84 --> 3390.14]  in one holy Catholic church
[3390.14 --> 3391.48]  not one Dutch denomination.
[3391.48 --> 3395.74]  it's one universal church.
[3396.32 --> 3397.54]  We cannot operate
[3397.54 --> 3398.62]  with the assumption
[3398.62 --> 3400.04]  that we are a Dutch church
[3400.04 --> 3401.28]  because the reality is
[3401.28 --> 3402.58]  the CRCNA,
[3402.72 --> 3404.26]  the CRC Church of North America
[3404.26 --> 3405.06]  has expanded
[3405.06 --> 3406.18]  far beyond the Netherlands.
[3407.46 --> 3408.70]  My seminary experience
[3408.70 --> 3409.10]  is proof.
[3409.38 --> 3410.26]  Korean, Nigerian,
[3410.36 --> 3410.78]  Guatemalan,
[3410.90 --> 3411.62]  Brazilian, Chinese,
[3411.74 --> 3413.06]  the CRC is growing
[3413.06 --> 3413.88]  and that's wonderful.
[3415.50 --> 3416.40]  But it's growing
[3416.40 --> 3418.26]  because of its diversity.
[3418.26 --> 3420.80]  not despite it.
[3423.22 --> 3424.00]  And so can we remember
[3424.00 --> 3425.14]  and celebrate our history
[3425.14 --> 3426.04]  that defines us?
[3426.14 --> 3427.56]  Yeah, of course we can.
[3428.18 --> 3429.48]  But we should never
[3429.48 --> 3431.84]  let the Dutchness
[3431.84 --> 3433.58]  of our denomination
[3433.58 --> 3434.28]  become something
[3434.28 --> 3435.44]  that divides us
[3435.44 --> 3436.24]  from others
[3436.24 --> 3437.14]  especially guests
[3437.14 --> 3437.58]  or others
[3437.58 --> 3439.22]  entering into the fold.
[3439.34 --> 3440.20]  That's what was happening
[3440.20 --> 3440.88]  in our text.
[3441.82 --> 3442.84]  The rules of food
[3442.84 --> 3443.64]  and circumcision
[3443.64 --> 3444.80]  once defined a people
[3444.80 --> 3446.18]  but it was dividing them now.
[3447.00 --> 3448.86]  The Dutchness of the CRC
[3448.86 --> 3450.48]  once defines us
[3450.48 --> 3452.38]  but it cannot divide us.
[3453.26 --> 3454.34]  We can celebrate
[3454.34 --> 3455.52]  but we cannot flaunt.
[3457.38 --> 3458.18]  I know a lot of us
[3458.18 --> 3458.76]  have heard the phrase
[3458.76 --> 3459.38]  if you ain't Dutch
[3459.38 --> 3459.96]  you ain't much.
[3460.42 --> 3462.14]  That should never be spoken
[3462.14 --> 3462.72]  in a church.
[3463.74 --> 3464.22]  Ever.
[3465.60 --> 3466.48]  And honestly
[3466.48 --> 3467.02]  I'd be careful
[3467.02 --> 3467.78]  using that anywhere
[3467.78 --> 3468.70]  to be honest with you
[3468.70 --> 3470.60]  because words
[3470.60 --> 3471.72]  even in jest
[3471.72 --> 3473.44]  divide
[3473.44 --> 3475.24]  and they separate
[3475.24 --> 3476.84]  they polarize.
[3478.44 --> 3479.58]  And maybe it's more than that.
[3479.64 --> 3480.50]  The songs we sing
[3480.50 --> 3481.48]  the prayers we pray
[3481.48 --> 3482.32]  the events we do
[3482.32 --> 3482.90]  the hospitality
[3482.90 --> 3484.12]  that we show
[3484.12 --> 3484.98]  we cannot fall
[3484.98 --> 3486.26]  into a trap
[3486.26 --> 3487.94]  that we see in our text today
[3487.94 --> 3488.18]  and think
[3488.18 --> 3489.44]  we have to do things this way
[3489.44 --> 3491.04]  because we're a Dutch church
[3491.04 --> 3493.52]  or a Canadian church
[3493.52 --> 3495.68]  or pick whatever word
[3495.68 --> 3496.30]  you want to use
[3496.30 --> 3496.72]  church.
[3497.60 --> 3498.76]  No, we're the church.
[3501.38 --> 3502.34]  We've got to be careful
[3502.34 --> 3504.12]  with our national pride
[3504.12 --> 3505.98]  when it comes to God's kingdom.
[3507.82 --> 3509.24]  We are God's church
[3509.24 --> 3509.96]  full stop.
[3512.32 --> 3513.84]  So how do we as a church
[3513.84 --> 3514.92]  here in Langley, B.C.
[3515.32 --> 3516.46]  grow into the picture
[3516.46 --> 3517.36]  of God's kingdom
[3517.36 --> 3519.42]  that's found in Revelation 7?
[3519.74 --> 3520.60]  The picture painted
[3520.60 --> 3521.38]  by Peter
[3521.38 --> 3522.92]  or by the story of Peter
[3522.92 --> 3523.74]  here in Acts 10.
[3525.18 --> 3526.18]  Well that's a question
[3526.18 --> 3527.14]  that I'm going to invite you
[3527.14 --> 3527.98]  to take home with you
[3527.98 --> 3529.54]  and discuss around your tables
[3529.54 --> 3530.48]  today after church.
[3530.48 --> 3532.50]  And then speaking
[3532.50 --> 3533.24]  of those tables
[3533.24 --> 3534.16]  that's the third point.
[3535.50 --> 3536.72]  Who is at your table?
[3539.50 --> 3541.04]  Acts 10 focuses on food
[3541.04 --> 3542.58]  and hospitality throughout
[3542.58 --> 3544.40]  and so we'll end
[3544.40 --> 3545.10]  with this question.
[3545.74 --> 3547.98]  Who sits at your table?
[3549.82 --> 3550.54]  See our world
[3550.54 --> 3551.60]  likes to create boxes
[3551.60 --> 3553.36]  and divide people
[3553.36 --> 3554.34]  into categories.
[3554.56 --> 3555.90]  Political lines
[3555.90 --> 3556.68]  are drawn now
[3556.68 --> 3558.22]  with thicker and thicker ink
[3558.22 --> 3558.86]  these days
[3558.86 --> 3560.70]  and social media algorithms.
[3561.22 --> 3562.26]  They start sending us
[3562.26 --> 3563.78]  to other like-minded people.
[3564.10 --> 3565.44]  Echo chambers are formed
[3565.44 --> 3566.34]  oftentimes without
[3566.34 --> 3567.52]  us even realizing it
[3567.52 --> 3568.40]  and we start hearing
[3568.40 --> 3569.16]  the same messages,
[3569.38 --> 3570.08]  the same opinions,
[3570.24 --> 3571.10]  the same platforms
[3571.10 --> 3572.86]  that we mostly align with
[3572.86 --> 3573.80]  and then we start hearing
[3573.80 --> 3574.30]  those messages
[3574.30 --> 3575.10]  over and over again
[3575.10 --> 3575.82]  louder and louder.
[3576.68 --> 3577.82]  We're defined
[3577.82 --> 3578.98]  and we're divided
[3578.98 --> 3580.64]  into pockets of people
[3580.64 --> 3581.96]  who think and act the same.
[3581.96 --> 3583.80]  Ironically,
[3584.46 --> 3585.48]  individualism,
[3585.60 --> 3586.44]  the pursuit
[3586.44 --> 3587.60]  and celebration
[3587.60 --> 3588.46]  of what makes you,
[3588.58 --> 3588.90]  you,
[3589.70 --> 3590.70]  and echo chambers,
[3590.88 --> 3592.02]  places where individuals
[3592.02 --> 3593.10]  like you are just joined
[3593.10 --> 3593.88]  with other individuals
[3593.88 --> 3594.78]  like you,
[3595.46 --> 3596.32]  work in tandem
[3596.32 --> 3598.54]  to define who you are.
[3599.60 --> 3600.80]  And it affects a lot of things,
[3600.84 --> 3601.92]  even how you read
[3601.92 --> 3602.82]  and apply the Bible.
[3604.98 --> 3606.48]  There's an African pastor
[3606.48 --> 3607.96]  named Conrad Mbuie
[3607.96 --> 3609.60]  and he says this
[3609.60 --> 3611.04]  regarding bringing the word
[3611.04 --> 3612.86]  to his church in Africa.
[3613.54 --> 3614.26]  He says,
[3614.54 --> 3616.60]  I'm not trying to make
[3616.60 --> 3617.64]  the Bible more African.
[3618.66 --> 3619.70]  I'm trying to get
[3619.70 --> 3620.60]  the church in Africa
[3620.60 --> 3621.92]  to be more biblical.
[3623.46 --> 3624.18]  Our unity
[3624.18 --> 3626.28]  as God's family,
[3626.40 --> 3626.82]  the church,
[3626.96 --> 3628.16]  is our greatest witness
[3628.16 --> 3628.96]  to unbelievers.
[3631.10 --> 3632.06]  North American churches
[3632.06 --> 3632.58]  should be preaching
[3632.58 --> 3633.36]  the same message,
[3633.82 --> 3635.02]  becoming more biblical,
[3635.96 --> 3637.16]  not more Canadian biblical
[3637.16 --> 3638.32]  or more Dutch biblical,
[3638.62 --> 3639.76]  but becoming more biblical
[3639.76 --> 3642.44]  unites us all
[3642.44 --> 3643.70]  because the church,
[3644.68 --> 3645.48]  man, the church,
[3645.80 --> 3646.80]  the church is different.
[3647.66 --> 3649.60]  It's diverse yet unified
[3649.60 --> 3650.34]  under Christ.
[3650.48 --> 3651.38]  We disagree,
[3651.94 --> 3653.16]  but we worship together.
[3653.74 --> 3655.44]  We discuss and debate
[3655.44 --> 3656.36]  and hold councils
[3656.36 --> 3657.62]  and synods and meetings
[3657.62 --> 3658.96]  and we don't always agree,
[3659.70 --> 3661.06]  but we read the same word
[3661.06 --> 3662.18]  and we pray together
[3662.18 --> 3663.66]  and we pray to the same God
[3663.66 --> 3664.90]  and we are unified
[3664.90 --> 3665.86]  despite our differences.
[3665.86 --> 3667.12]  It's fascinating
[3667.12 --> 3668.42]  what the church is.
[3669.30 --> 3669.72]  Look around.
[3669.84 --> 3670.60]  Look around right now
[3670.60 --> 3671.02]  at the sanctuary.
[3671.14 --> 3671.74]  Look at other people.
[3671.84 --> 3672.40]  Make some awkward
[3672.40 --> 3673.26]  eye contact here.
[3673.74 --> 3674.70]  There are young people
[3674.70 --> 3675.56]  and old people here.
[3675.92 --> 3676.82]  There are people you know
[3676.82 --> 3677.68]  and people you don't.
[3677.98 --> 3679.30]  There are new Christians here
[3679.30 --> 3680.70]  and there are lifelong believers
[3680.70 --> 3681.88]  here in this room.
[3682.12 --> 3683.90]  There's politically conservative people
[3683.90 --> 3685.08]  and politically liberal.
[3685.36 --> 3686.10]  There's traditional
[3686.10 --> 3687.48]  and there's contemporary.
[3687.70 --> 3688.72]  There's Oilers fans
[3688.72 --> 3689.88]  and there's Canucks fans.
[3690.00 --> 3690.74]  We're all here.
[3690.74 --> 3694.68]  You're listening right now
[3694.68 --> 3696.88]  to the same flawed youth pastor
[3696.88 --> 3698.40]  yammer on up here
[3698.40 --> 3700.20]  no matter how your last week went.
[3701.34 --> 3702.42]  We're all singing
[3702.42 --> 3703.86]  the same worship songs
[3703.86 --> 3705.62]  no matter what our opinions are
[3705.62 --> 3706.68]  on the various political
[3706.68 --> 3707.88]  electoral things
[3707.88 --> 3708.54]  that are coming up.
[3709.64 --> 3710.66]  We're all going to go drink
[3710.66 --> 3712.58]  the same old coffee
[3712.58 --> 3714.62]  and enjoy some good old fashioned
[3714.62 --> 3715.20]  koinonia,
[3715.52 --> 3716.52]  shout out to an old sermon,
[3716.84 --> 3718.88]  no matter what our heritage is,
[3718.88 --> 3721.66]  no matter what our Sunday traditions are.
[3722.58 --> 3723.22]  Look around.
[3724.58 --> 3725.18]  Do it.
[3725.22 --> 3725.66]  Look around.
[3726.66 --> 3728.18]  We all have different stories.
[3728.94 --> 3730.34]  We all have different stories
[3730.34 --> 3731.22]  of why we're here.
[3732.60 --> 3733.00]  And yet,
[3733.28 --> 3735.00]  within those different stories,
[3735.48 --> 3736.66]  we are connected
[3736.66 --> 3739.34]  to the one true story.
[3740.14 --> 3742.50]  The one true redemption story
[3742.50 --> 3744.02]  that God has been authoring
[3744.02 --> 3745.80]  and directing since the dawn of time.
[3747.16 --> 3748.00]  Different stories
[3748.00 --> 3749.44]  gets grafted into one story.
[3750.20 --> 3751.76]  We're united in our diversity.
[3752.76 --> 3754.70]  What's compelling about the church,
[3754.78 --> 3756.36]  what's so compelling about the church
[3756.36 --> 3758.44]  is that we are all different people
[3758.44 --> 3759.54]  with different stories
[3759.54 --> 3760.54]  and different ideas
[3760.54 --> 3761.60]  and different perspectives
[3761.60 --> 3762.66]  on different things.
[3763.34 --> 3763.66]  And yet,
[3763.76 --> 3764.86]  despite all of the different,
[3765.70 --> 3769.20]  we are united in Christ.
[3770.50 --> 3772.58]  We can praise God for that truth.
[3772.58 --> 3775.82]  And so as you go from this place,
[3776.34 --> 3778.58]  who comes to your table?
[3778.64 --> 3779.36]  Who's at your table?
[3780.46 --> 3781.58]  Does the company we keep
[3781.58 --> 3783.36]  represent the kingdom of God
[3783.36 --> 3784.32]  as laid out for us
[3784.32 --> 3785.10]  in Acts 10,
[3785.80 --> 3786.62]  in Acts 15,
[3786.94 --> 3787.92]  in Revelation 7?
[3788.44 --> 3791.06]  We're united in Christ.
[3791.94 --> 3793.32]  Let's be united in Christ.
[3793.62 --> 3793.82]  Amen?
[3795.08 --> 3795.68]  Let's pray.
[3795.68 --> 3800.88]  Father in heaven,
[3802.02 --> 3802.92]  Savior in spirit,
[3803.12 --> 3803.30]  God,
[3803.66 --> 3805.16]  we come to you today
[3805.16 --> 3808.38]  as the church,
[3809.58 --> 3811.32]  united under the truth
[3811.32 --> 3812.14]  of Jesus,
[3812.28 --> 3812.68]  your life,
[3812.78 --> 3813.10]  your death,
[3813.18 --> 3813.86]  your resurrection,
[3814.00 --> 3814.96]  your ascension into heaven.
[3817.36 --> 3817.62]  And Lord,
[3817.68 --> 3818.44]  the world we live in
[3818.44 --> 3819.14]  is not united.
[3819.64 --> 3819.78]  God,
[3819.82 --> 3821.66]  we live in a very polarized world.
[3822.54 --> 3823.76]  Opinions fly around,
[3823.76 --> 3825.36]  arguments happen everywhere,
[3825.68 --> 3826.54]  in person,
[3826.82 --> 3827.36]  online,
[3827.48 --> 3828.38]  all over the place.
[3828.56 --> 3829.94]  And it is easy to slip
[3829.94 --> 3832.28]  into a polarized culture
[3832.28 --> 3833.48]  that exists around us.
[3834.02 --> 3834.58]  But God,
[3835.56 --> 3836.78]  you unite.
[3838.96 --> 3841.12]  Every race,
[3842.28 --> 3844.68]  every person
[3844.68 --> 3847.06]  can come to know you
[3847.06 --> 3848.96]  through the power of your spirit.
[3849.66 --> 3850.04]  And so God,
[3850.10 --> 3852.18]  we pray for the church global.
[3852.18 --> 3853.24]  We pray for the churches
[3853.24 --> 3854.58]  in Africa,
[3854.76 --> 3855.56]  in South America,
[3855.72 --> 3856.30]  in Asia,
[3856.46 --> 3856.66]  God,
[3856.70 --> 3857.70]  all over the world
[3857.70 --> 3860.38]  in all the work
[3860.38 --> 3860.96]  that they're doing.
[3861.40 --> 3861.52]  Lord,
[3861.54 --> 3862.86]  may we join with them.
[3863.12 --> 3863.20]  Lord,
[3863.26 --> 3863.88]  today's offering
[3863.88 --> 3865.92]  was for our refugee chaplain
[3865.92 --> 3867.20]  who's doing that kind of work
[3867.20 --> 3867.98]  all over the world,
[3868.10 --> 3868.20]  Lord.
[3868.40 --> 3869.76]  We think of those missionaries
[3869.76 --> 3870.74]  that we know and support.
[3871.26 --> 3871.46]  God,
[3871.56 --> 3873.34]  we are your hands and feet
[3873.34 --> 3874.12]  all over the world.
[3875.36 --> 3876.56]  May we live
[3876.56 --> 3877.68]  how you call us to live
[3877.68 --> 3878.42]  here in Langley
[3878.42 --> 3880.14]  and may we open our doors
[3880.14 --> 3881.10]  to the world.
[3881.10 --> 3884.38]  and preach this good news
[3884.38 --> 3886.02]  to those around us.
[3886.16 --> 3886.32]  Lord,
[3886.38 --> 3887.12]  we live in a culture
[3887.12 --> 3888.54]  where you call us
[3888.54 --> 3889.42]  to go to all nations,
[3889.56 --> 3889.64]  Lord,
[3889.68 --> 3890.34]  but we live in a culture
[3890.34 --> 3890.88]  where all nations
[3890.88 --> 3891.54]  are coming to us.
[3893.16 --> 3894.08]  May we be bold
[3894.08 --> 3895.98]  in proclaiming your name
[3895.98 --> 3896.50]  as Lord.
[3897.84 --> 3898.58]  We pray this
[3898.58 --> 3899.16]  in your name.
[3899.76 --> 3899.96]  Amen.
[3899.96 --> 3900.06]  Amen.
[3904.64 --> 3905.26]  Please rise
[3905.26 --> 3906.12]  as we respond in song.
[3906.12 --> 3923.58]  A church's one foundation
[3923.58 --> 3926.40]  is Jesus Christ,
[3926.40 --> 3928.08]  our Lord.
[3928.08 --> 3928.82]  Lord,
[3928.82 --> 3932.44]  He is His new creation
[3932.44 --> 3936.90]  by water and the word.
[3937.50 --> 3939.90]  From Him He came
[3939.90 --> 3941.94]  and sought her
[3941.94 --> 3946.04]  to be His holy bride.
[3946.60 --> 3948.98]  With His own blood
[3948.98 --> 3951.04]  He bought her
[3951.04 --> 3955.94]  and for her life He died.
[3955.94 --> 3961.68]  He left from every nation
[3961.68 --> 3966.14]  yet one o'er all the earth
[3966.14 --> 3970.80]  her charge of salvation
[3970.80 --> 3972.60]  one Lord,
[3972.72 --> 3973.74]  one faith,
[3973.86 --> 3975.70]  one birth
[3975.70 --> 3978.64]  one holy name
[3978.64 --> 3980.98]  She blesses
[3980.98 --> 3982.48]  partakes
[3982.48 --> 3985.18]  one holy food
[3985.18 --> 3988.14]  and to an hope
[3988.14 --> 3990.10]  she presses
[3990.10 --> 3993.34]  with every grace
[3993.34 --> 3995.38]  and hope
[3995.38 --> 4001.34]  His God and tribulation
[4001.34 --> 4006.22]  and tumult of her war
[4006.22 --> 4011.14]  She wakes the consummation
[4011.14 --> 4012.66]  of peace
[4012.66 --> 4015.22]  forevermore
[4015.22 --> 4020.22]  Till His vision glorious
[4020.22 --> 4025.48]  and all in eyes are blessed
[4025.48 --> 4030.46]  Then the great church victorious
[4030.46 --> 4033.82]  shall be the church
[4033.82 --> 4035.62]  and rest
[4035.62 --> 4037.84]  shall be the church
[4037.84 --> 4038.62]  and rest

[4045.06 --> 4045.54]  in the church
[4045.54 --> 4046.10]  he's going to hate
[4046.10 --> 4046.78]  that I'm doing this
[4046.78 --> 4047.96]  but we have a guitar player
[4047.96 --> 4049.04]  who just played the piano
[4049.04 --> 4049.90]  in a church service
[4049.90 --> 4050.60]  for the first time
[4050.60 --> 4051.92]  since he was in grade 6
[4051.92 --> 4053.38]  Isn't that something?
[4054.76 --> 4055.46]  Look at that
[4055.46 --> 4057.94]  If you go from this place
[4057.94 --> 4058.76]  please enjoy some
[4058.76 --> 4059.92]  koinonia in the foyer

[4062.64 --> 4063.66]  and let's remember
[4063.66 --> 4064.36]  that this church
[4064.36 --> 4065.16]  that we are a part of

[4068.14 --> 4068.98]  of a global
