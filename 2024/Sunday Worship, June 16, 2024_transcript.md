[0.00 --> 5.00]  Making diamonds out of dust
[5.00 --> 8.00]  I won't be afraid to shine
[8.00 --> 13.00]  I won't be afraid to shine
[13.00 --> 16.00]  I won't be afraid to shine
[16.84 --> 21.32]  Cause he's making diamonds out of dust
[21.32 --> 26.06]  Making diamonds out of dust
[30.00 --> 35.00]  Making diamonds out of dust
[35.00 --> 50.00]  I want you as you are, not as you ought to be
[50.00 --> 55.00]  Won't you lay down your guard and come to me
[55.00 --> 60.00]  The shame that grips you now is crippling
[60.00 --> 66.00]  It breaks my heart to see you suffering
[66.00 --> 69.00]  Cause I am for you
[69.00 --> 73.00]  I'm not against you
[73.00 --> 78.00]  If you wanna know how far my love can go
[78.00 --> 82.00]  Just how deep, just how wide
[82.00 --> 86.00]  If you wanna see how much you mean to me
[86.00 --> 89.00]  Look at my hands, look at my side
[89.00 --> 95.00]  If you could count the times and say you are forgiven
[95.00 --> 99.00]  It's more than the drops in the ocean
[106.00 --> 111.00]  Don't think you need to settle for a substitute
[112.00 --> 116.00]  When I'm the only love that changes you
[116.00 --> 117.00]  And I am for you
[117.00 --> 118.00]  And I am for you
[118.00 --> 119.00]  And I am for you
[120.00 --> 122.00]  I'm not against you
[123.00 --> 126.00]  I am for you
[127.00 --> 129.00]  I'm not against you
[129.00 --> 135.00]  If you wanna know how far my love can go
[135.00 --> 137.00]  Just how deep, just how wide
[137.00 --> 138.00]  Just how wide
[138.00 --> 139.00]  Just how wide
[139.00 --> 142.00]  If you wanna see how much you mean to me
[142.00 --> 144.00]  Look at my hands, look at my side
[144.00 --> 148.00]  If you could count the times and say you are forgiven
[148.00 --> 150.00]  It's more than the drops in the ocean
[150.00 --> 154.00]  Drops in the ocean
[154.00 --> 158.00]  Drops in the ocean
[158.00 --> 164.00]  Open your heart
[164.00 --> 167.00]  It's time that we start again
[167.00 --> 171.00]  Open your heart
[171.00 --> 174.00]  It's time that we start again
[174.00 --> 175.00]  Open your heart
[175.00 --> 177.00]  It's time that we start again
[178.00 --> 180.00]  If you wanna know how far my love can go
[180.00 --> 184.00]  Just how deep, just how wide
[184.00 --> 188.48]  If you want to see how much you mean to me
[188.48 --> 191.78]  Look at my hands, look at my side
[191.78 --> 197.48]  If you could count the times that day you are forgiven
[197.48 --> 200.94]  It's more than the drops in the ocean
[200.94 --> 208.32]  The drops in the ocean
[214.00 --> 221.26]  I am for you, I'm not against you
[221.26 --> 228.86]  I am for you, I'm not against you
[244.00 --> 250.76]  You're not the only one who feels like this
[250.76 --> 254.52]  Feeling like you lose more than you win
[254.52 --> 258.64]  Like life is just an endless hill you climb
[258.64 --> 263.02]  You try and try, but never arrive
[263.02 --> 266.04]  I'm telling you something
[266.04 --> 268.04]  This racing, this running
[268.04 --> 270.78]  Oh, you're working way too hard
[270.78 --> 274.02]  And this perfection you're chasing
[274.02 --> 276.14]  It's just energy wasted
[276.14 --> 278.82]  Cause he loves you like you are
[278.82 --> 282.26]  So go ahead and live like you're loved
[282.26 --> 286.84]  It's okay to act like you've been set free
[286.84 --> 290.30]  His love has made you more than enough
[290.30 --> 295.06]  So go ahead and be who he made you to be
[295.06 --> 297.78]  And live like you're loved
[297.78 --> 303.24]  Live like you're loved
[303.24 --> 307.24]  Live like you're loved
[307.24 --> 310.04]  Live like you're loved
[310.04 --> 314.10]  And live like you know you're valuable
[314.10 --> 318.60]  Like you know the one that holds your soul
[318.60 --> 322.78]  Cause mercy has called you by your name
[322.78 --> 327.08]  Don't be afraid to live in that grace
[327.08 --> 330.02]  Oh, I'm telling you something
[330.02 --> 332.24]  This God we believe in
[332.24 --> 334.74]  Yeah, he changed everything
[334.74 --> 337.88]  No more guilt, no more shame
[337.88 --> 339.86]  He took all that away
[339.86 --> 343.06]  Gave us a reason to sing
[343.06 --> 346.24]  So go ahead and live like you're loved
[346.24 --> 350.84]  It's okay to act like you've been set free
[350.84 --> 354.30]  His love has made you more than enough
[354.30 --> 359.06]  So go ahead and be who he made you to be
[359.06 --> 362.70]  And live like you're loved
[362.70 --> 365.70]  Live like you're loved
[365.70 --> 371.16]  Live like you're loved
[371.16 --> 375.16]  Live like you're loved
[375.16 --> 377.16]  Live like you're loved
[377.16 --> 379.04]  Walk like you're free
[379.04 --> 383.06]  Stand like you know who he made you to be
[383.06 --> 385.16]  Live like you're loved
[385.16 --> 387.04]  Like you believe
[387.04 --> 391.08]  His love is all that you'll ever need
[391.08 --> 394.26]  So go ahead and live like you're loved
[394.26 --> 402.30]  His love has made you more than enough
[402.30 --> 410.24]  So go ahead and live like you're loved
[410.24 --> 414.92]  It's okay to act like you've been set free
[414.92 --> 418.58]  His love has made you more than enough
[418.58 --> 423.12]  So go ahead and be who he made you to be
[423.12 --> 426.12]  And live like you're loved
[426.12 --> 427.10]  And live like you're loved
[427.10 --> 431.10]  Live like you're loved
[431.10 --> 439.74]  Live like you're loved
[439.74 --> 441.16]  Live like you're loved
[441.16 --> 443.06]  Walk like you're free
[443.06 --> 447.04]  Stand like you know who he made you to be
[447.04 --> 449.16]  Live like you're loved
[449.16 --> 455.10]  Like you believe, his love is all that you'll ever need
[455.10 --> 457.34]  A man like your love
[457.34 --> 487.32]  A man like your love
[487.34 --> 489.38]  And you're holding on
[489.38 --> 492.12]  But feel like you're falling
[492.12 --> 495.56]  With every option exhausted
[495.56 --> 499.70]  You tried everything you know
[499.70 --> 504.22]  You saw light then you lost it
[504.22 --> 507.34]  But there is still hope
[507.34 --> 511.26]  Like the fire in the night
[511.26 --> 515.20]  Like the ocean parted wide
[515.20 --> 519.02]  Like the grave empty inside
[519.02 --> 523.04]  You will see he's still dead
[523.04 --> 524.52]  Miracles
[524.52 --> 526.52]  Miracles
[526.52 --> 528.34]  Miracles
[528.34 --> 530.34]  Miracles
[530.34 --> 534.54]  Even if you don't see it now
[534.54 --> 536.24]  Without a doubt
[536.24 --> 538.94]  He's already moving
[538.94 --> 542.46]  There's not a pain that you hold
[542.46 --> 544.06]  He doesn't know
[544.06 --> 546.78]  And he isn't using
[546.78 --> 550.20]  With every option exhausted
[550.20 --> 554.44]  You tried everything you know
[554.44 --> 559.04]  So reach for something beyond it
[559.04 --> 561.96]  Cause he is our hope
[561.96 --> 565.88]  Like the fire in the night
[565.88 --> 569.82]  Like the ocean parted wide
[569.82 --> 573.64]  Like the grave empty inside
[573.64 --> 577.62]  You will see he's still dead
[577.62 --> 579.14]  Miracles
[579.14 --> 581.48]  Miracles

[620.78 --> 621.14]  Miracles
[621.14 --> 622.08]  Miracles
[622.08 --> 629.08]  You will see he still does miracles
[629.08 --> 639.08]  He still does
[639.08 --> 642.08]  He still does
[642.08 --> 646.08]  You're the new can't I dream
[646.08 --> 650.08]  More than you have nothing
[650.08 --> 654.08]  Destination
[654.08 --> 656.08]  Destination
[656.08 --> 660.08]  Miracle
[680.08 --> 690.08]  Destination
[690.08 --> 700.08]  I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I'm not enough
[700.08 --> 710.08]  Every single lie that tells me I will never measure
[710.08 --> 720.08]  Love
[720.08 --> 724.08]  Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low
[724.08 --> 738.08]  Remind me once again just who I am because I need to know
[738.08 --> 748.08]  You say I'm loved when I can't feel a thing
[748.08 --> 756.08]  You say I'm strong when I think I'm weak
[756.08 --> 762.08]  Good morning everyone
[762.08 --> 766.08]  Welcome to Langley Emanuel CRC this morning
[766.08 --> 769.08]  It's good to see that this section showed up today
[769.08 --> 772.08]  We'll see if the other sections come too
[772.08 --> 775.08]  Happy Father's Day to everyone out there
[775.08 --> 779.08]  We are so grateful and thankful for all of you dads out there
[779.08 --> 781.08]  So a special Father's Day to you
[781.08 --> 784.08]  We know that this is a very exciting day and a fun day for so many
[784.08 --> 788.08]  We also pray alongside of many of you where this is a difficult day
[788.08 --> 792.08]  We know that Father's Day brings a lot of different contexts with families
[792.08 --> 794.08]  There are people who have lost dads
[794.08 --> 795.08]  There's dads who have lost kids
[795.08 --> 799.08]  There's people who have strained relationships with their fathers as well
[799.08 --> 800.08]  And we are praying for you
[800.08 --> 801.08]  We are here for you as well
[801.08 --> 807.08]  We pray that today is a day that God our Father brings you a sense of peace as well
[808.08 --> 811.08]  I'm going to go through a couple of announcements this morning
[811.08 --> 813.08]  I'm going to invite Brenda Elkema up for it
[813.08 --> 815.08]  She's got an announcement or two as well
[815.08 --> 817.08]  Before you get to my announcements
[817.08 --> 821.08]  Pastor Chris is not here today because he is at Synod
[821.08 --> 823.08]  At Synod this week
[823.08 --> 825.08]  And so he is in Grand Rapids doing that
[825.08 --> 829.08]  And so my name if I didn't introduce myself is Kevin
[829.08 --> 832.08]  I'm the youth pastor here and that's why I am up here right now
[832.08 --> 834.08]  So I'm going to throw it over to Brenda Elkema
[834.08 --> 838.08]  And she's going to have a couple of announcements on behalf of the Deacons
[839.08 --> 841.08]  Good morning and welcome here
[841.08 --> 844.08]  Yes, I have a couple of announcements from the Deacons
[844.08 --> 850.08]  One is today is sort of officially our last day for the Baby Bottle Campaign
[850.08 --> 852.08]  For the Hope for Women
[852.08 --> 856.08]  You can return them if you have them with you
[856.08 --> 858.08]  You can return them to me
[858.08 --> 861.08]  I'll be in the back at the Connect booth after the service
[861.08 --> 865.08]  If you forgot or anything like that, that's fine
[865.08 --> 866.08]  We've got next week
[866.08 --> 871.08]  If you'd still like to take a bottle today and fill it and return it next week
[871.08 --> 872.08]  That's possible too
[872.08 --> 874.08]  So come and see me afterwards
[874.08 --> 879.08]  The other announcement I have has to do with our annual
[879.08 --> 881.08]  It's become an annual
[881.08 --> 886.08]  Food Bank Drive that we've done the last couple of years in July
[886.08 --> 890.08]  It's a time for the Food Bank that they can really use our support
[890.08 --> 892.08]  They've really appreciated it
[892.08 --> 898.08]  And we've set the date this year for July the 7th
[898.08 --> 907.08]  Sunday July the 7th will be the day that we go out and we hand out grocery bags to our neighborhood
[907.08 --> 909.08]  Around here in Murrayville
[909.08 --> 913.08]  There will be routes, maps, all of that sort of thing
[913.08 --> 918.08]  You will be, maybe should be contacted by your elder
[918.08 --> 920.08]  I know all the elders don't know that yet
[920.08 --> 922.08]  But you're getting an email too
[922.08 --> 929.08]  To just gather some of those from your district to be able to hand out the grocery bags
[929.08 --> 932.08]  Then on July the 13th, the following Saturday
[932.08 --> 936.08]  We will have our community event
[936.08 --> 940.08]  Where people can bring back their filled grocery bags
[940.08 --> 944.08]  And we'll have a pancake breakfast and activity stations
[944.08 --> 946.08]  That's where you all come in
[946.08 --> 954.08]  I have and will have in the back church a sign up for you to put your name and phone number
[954.08 --> 960.08]  For any event, any part of that event that you would be able to help out with
[960.08 --> 967.08]  There's set up, there's clean up, there's pancake flippers that we need
[967.08 --> 969.08]  There's a welcome booth
[969.08 --> 974.08]  We need some people to drive, like to pick up the bouncy castle
[974.08 --> 977.08]  And then there's activity stations as well
[977.08 --> 979.08]  So if you're able to help out, that would be great
[979.08 --> 981.08]  I'll put these at the Connect booth as well
[981.08 --> 982.08]  Thanks
[982.08 --> 988.08]  A couple more announcements this morning
[988.08 --> 991.08]  Next week Sunday, the 23rd
[991.08 --> 994.08]  You're all invited to stay following the AM service
[994.08 --> 997.08]  We're going to have a very brief, I've seen the agenda
[997.08 --> 998.08]  Congregational meeting
[998.08 --> 1001.08]  And then a very exciting barbecue as well
[1001.08 --> 1003.08]  So come stay for a barbecue lunch
[1003.08 --> 1004.08]  Stay for a congregational meeting
[1004.08 --> 1006.08]  We've got to give the thumbs up to some finances
[1006.08 --> 1008.08]  That should be a fun Sunday as well
[1008.08 --> 1010.08]  So please stick around for that
[1010.08 --> 1013.08]  Finally, on behalf of Children's Worship Time
[1013.08 --> 1015.08]  We are looking for a little bit of help
[1015.08 --> 1019.08]  The final Sunday of our regular schedule for Children's Worship Time on Sunday
[1019.08 --> 1021.08]  Is coming to an end in a couple weeks
[1021.08 --> 1023.08]  And then we're going to hit summer mode
[1023.08 --> 1025.08]  And in order for summer Children's Worship Time to happen
[1025.08 --> 1027.08]  For our younger kids
[1027.08 --> 1030.08]  We're looking for a number of teachers out there as well
[1030.08 --> 1033.08]  I think we're still in need of like 13 people to sign up for a Sunday
[1033.08 --> 1035.08]  So if you can do that, that's all found online
[1035.08 --> 1037.08]  It's also at the back at the Children's Worship booth
[1037.08 --> 1039.08]  Or you can talk to me, or you can talk to Amy
[1039.08 --> 1040.08]  Or you can talk to Amy
[1040.08 --> 1041.08]  She's waving through the glass
[1041.08 --> 1043.08]  If you all turned around, you can see her
[1043.08 --> 1044.08]  She's waving at everyone
[1044.08 --> 1045.08]  It's all very exciting
[1045.08 --> 1047.08]  Go talk to her as well
[1047.08 --> 1048.08]  Finally, about Amy
[1048.08 --> 1051.08]  Amy has been coordinating Children's Worship Time for the past three years
[1051.08 --> 1055.08]  But she is looking to step away from the Children's Coordinator position
[1055.08 --> 1057.08]  Starting in September
[1057.08 --> 1060.08]  And so we are looking for one or two or three people
[1060.08 --> 1063.08]  To help coordinate that Children's Worship Time ministry
[1063.08 --> 1066.08]  As an added bonus, you get to work with me a little bit
[1066.08 --> 1067.08]  So that's fun
[1067.08 --> 1073.08]  But we are looking for that to get set up for Sundays in September
[1073.08 --> 1075.08]  Amy is happy to help out with some scheduling
[1075.08 --> 1077.08]  And do a little bit of a transition with that
[1077.08 --> 1080.08]  But if that is an area that you are interested in helping out with
[1080.08 --> 1083.08]  Please come speak to me or to Amy
[1083.08 --> 1087.08]  And we'd love to have that rolling sooner than later as well
[1087.08 --> 1090.08]  I'm going to invite you now to please rise
[1090.08 --> 1095.08]  And hear God's greeting for us this Sunday morning
[1095.08 --> 1102.08]  God's greeting this morning comes from Revelation chapter 1
[1102.08 --> 1103.08]  Where it says

[1174.08 --> 1176.08]  And who is the rock except our God

[1337.08 --> 1344.08]  In your presence all our fears are washed away
[1345.08 --> 1348.08]  Washed away

[1379.08 --> 1385.08]  Hosanna, Hosanna
[1385.08 --> 1389.08]  You are the God who saved us

[1405.08 --> 1408.08]  We love you in fear, Lord Jesus
[1408.08 --> 1410.08]  Hosanna
[1411.08 --> 1414.08]  Hosanna, Hosanna
[1415.08 --> 1417.08]  As a God of all our spirits

[1431.08 --> 1460.08]  From the depths of the sea, from the heights of the heaven, your name be praised.
[1460.08 --> 1481.08]  From the hearts of the weak, from the shouts of the strong, from the lips of all people, this song we raise on.
[1481.08 --> 1493.08]  Throughout the endless ages, you will be crowned with praises, Lord, most high.
[1493.08 --> 1509.08]  Exalted in every nation, sovereign of all creation, Lord, most highly mankind.
[1509.08 --> 1531.08]  From the depths of the sea, from the depths of the sea, from the heights of heaven, your name be praised.
[1531.08 --> 1550.08]  From the hearts of the weak, from the shouts of the strong, from the lips of all people, this song we raise, Lord.
[1550.08 --> 1562.08]  Throughout the endless ages, you will be crowned with praises, Lord, most high.
[1562.08 --> 1576.08]  Exalted in every nation, sovereign of all creation, Lord, most high.
[1576.08 --> 1578.08]  Be magnified.
[1578.08 --> 1580.08]  Be magnified.
[1580.08 --> 1582.08]  Be magnified.
[1582.08 --> 1589.08]  You may have a seat.
[1589.08 --> 1601.08]  In 1 Peter 2, there are words of various sins that each of us can commit at any given time.
[1601.08 --> 1611.08]  Deceit, hypocrisy, envy, slander are just a few that are mentioned there.
[1611.08 --> 1620.08]  And if we think through our week, I'm sure each of us can be aware of at least one, if not more, that we have committed this week.
[1620.08 --> 1622.08]  I know I have.
[1622.08 --> 1625.08]  But 1 Peter 2 continues when it says,
[1625.08 --> 1636.08]  Like newborn babies crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation, now that you have tasted that the Lord is good.
[1636.08 --> 1657.08]  As you come to him, the living stone, rejected by humans, but chosen by God and precious to him, you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
[1657.08 --> 1660.08]  For in Scripture it says,
[1660.08 --> 1670.08]  See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.
[1670.08 --> 1674.08]  Now to you who believe, this stone is precious.
[1674.08 --> 1686.08]  But to those who do not believe, the stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone, and a stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall.
[1686.08 --> 1693.08]  They stumble because they disobey the message, which is also what they were destined for.
[1693.08 --> 1700.08]  Pure and by my heart, let me be a soul.
[1700.08 --> 1707.08]  Pure and by my heart, let me be a soul.
[1707.08 --> 1713.58]  Pure and by my heart, let me be a soul.
[1713.58 --> 1716.08]  Pure and by my heart, let me be a soul.
[1716.08 --> 1723.48]  Precious silver, purify my heart.
[1723.48 --> 1732.28]  Let me be as gold, pure gold.
[1732.82 --> 1736.90]  Reef my dear smile.
[1736.90 --> 1750.80]  My heart's one desire is to be holy.
[1752.02 --> 1763.82]  Set apart for you, Lord, I choose to be holy.
[1763.82 --> 1776.88]  Set apart for you, my Master, ready to do your will.
[1776.88 --> 1786.88]  Purify my heart.
[1787.48 --> 1789.88]  Cleanse me from within.
[1791.98 --> 1795.10]  And make me holy.
[1795.84 --> 1798.88]  Purify my heart.
[1798.88 --> 1803.88]  Cleanse me from my sin.
[1804.88 --> 1807.88]  Deep within.
[1808.88 --> 1812.88]  Reef my dear smile.
[1814.88 --> 1825.88]  My heart's one desire is to be holy.
[1825.88 --> 1838.88]  Set apart for you, Lord, I choose to be holy.
[1838.88 --> 1850.88]  Set apart for you, my Master, ready to do your will.
[1850.88 --> 1863.70]  Please stand with us together as we continue to hear words from 1 Peter 2.
[1863.70 --> 1867.50]  Where he goes on and says,
[1867.70 --> 1875.18]  But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession,
[1875.56 --> 1881.50]  that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.
[1882.38 --> 1886.78]  Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God.
[1886.78 --> 1892.40]  Once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
[1892.40 --> 1897.40]  Lord, yes, is your life in me, making me queen through your love.
[1897.40 --> 1921.40]  Holiness is your fire in me, making me queen through your love.
[1921.40 --> 1931.40]  Holiness is your fire in me, perfect in my heart like a flower.
[1931.40 --> 1941.40]  I know you are perfect in holiness.
[1941.40 --> 1948.40]  Holiness is your life in yours,citoeness is your life in me.
[1948.40 --> 1952.40]  Living твоему, С его ими любит меня.
[1952.40 --> 1959.40]  Только ты лай на газ� в Фурусную господио crippс bacterial пinta.
[1959.40 --> 1966.40] ilty
[1989.40 --> 1998.24]  Making me holy, holy the blood of Jesus.
[2002.44 --> 2010.62]  Holiness is your light in me, making me clean through your blood.
[2010.62 --> 2019.92]  Holiness is your fire in me, purging my heart like a flood.
[2022.32 --> 2030.12]  I know you are perfect in holiness.
[2030.12 --> 2040.42]  Holiness is your light in me, setting me free, making me holy.
[2041.64 --> 2048.36]  Holiness is your blood of Jesus, covered all of my sins.
[2050.36 --> 2059.20]  Holiness is your blood of Jesus, renews me from within.
[2060.12 --> 2068.12]  Your blood is enough, your mercy complete.
[2070.04 --> 2078.12]  Your worth of atonement, gave all my debts, making me holy.
[2080.12 --> 2084.86]  Holy the blood of Jesus.
[2090.12 --> 2102.00]  Good morning again.
[2102.00 --> 2103.00]  Thank you.
[2103.00 --> 2104.00]  Thank you.
[2104.00 --> 2110.24]  This morning we continue our worship with the giving of our gifts and for the budget of
[2110.24 --> 2111.22]  Emanuel Church here.
[2111.22 --> 2117.60]  Our special offering today is for World Renew, the refugee sponsorship and resettlement.
[2118.60 --> 2124.40]  Just to make a clarification, there is the World Renew refugee sponsorship and resettlement,
[2124.66 --> 2130.52]  and there is also a Langley Emanuel refugee sponsorship.
[2130.52 --> 2134.62]  This is for the World Renew, just to be clear there.
[2135.62 --> 2142.50]  Since 1979, World Renew has partnered with churches, other faith-based organizations and sponsoring groups
[2142.50 --> 2148.54]  to respond to the needs of refugees around the world and has successfully sponsored and resettled
[2148.54 --> 2151.14]  more than 11,000 refugees to Canada.
[2151.14 --> 2154.14]  No one is a refugee by choice.
[2154.74 --> 2160.28]  Inspired by scripture and God's love for all, World Renew is committed to helping families
[2160.28 --> 2162.00]  rebuild their lives with dignity.
[2162.96 --> 2168.32]  Sponsorship and resettlement provides refugees with protection and a hope for the future.
[2169.08 --> 2174.80]  It's a way of putting faith into action that can change lives, those of refugees and those
[2174.80 --> 2176.02]  who advocate for them.
[2176.02 --> 2182.10]  We are thankful that our church continues to be an active partner with World Renew in bringing
[2182.10 --> 2183.88]  hope and love to these families.
[2184.34 --> 2186.14]  Let's give as God has blessed us.
[2198.14 --> 2203.84]  Your word alone is solid ground
[2203.84 --> 2209.72]  The mighty rock on which we build
[2209.72 --> 2214.92]  In every line the truth is found
[2214.92 --> 2220.80]  And every page where glory fails
[2220.80 --> 2228.38]  Through faithful Lord we come to you
[2228.38 --> 2234.00]  We have no marriage we can claim
[2234.00 --> 2239.46]  Sure that your promise is all true
[2239.46 --> 2245.14]  We place our hope in tears of pain
[2245.14 --> 2249.70]  Gloria, Gloria
[2249.70 --> 2255.46]  Glory to God alone
[2255.46 --> 2258.46]  Gloria, Gloria
[2258.46 --> 2260.46]  Gloria, Gloria
[2260.46 --> 2266.94]  Gloria to God alone
[2266.94 --> 2279.46]  In Christ alone we're justified
[2279.46 --> 2281.46]  His righteousness is all our cheat
[2281.46 --> 2287.26]  His righteousness is all our keep
[2287.26 --> 2288.46]  Your lost amen
[2288.46 --> 2289.50]  Our satisfied
[2289.50 --> 2290.44]  His righteousness is all our keep
[2290.44 --> 2293.98]  Your lofty man is all our keep
[2293.98 --> 2294.54]  Your lostery man is all our start is wide
[2294.54 --> 2296.58]  His perfect work has set us free
[2296.58 --> 2307.58]  Gloria, Gloria, glory to God alone.
[2308.80 --> 2318.18]  Gloria, Gloria, glory to God alone.
[2326.58 --> 2332.44]  By grace alone we have been saved.
[2332.96 --> 2337.72]  All that we are has come from you.
[2338.68 --> 2343.68]  Hearts that were once by sin enslaved,
[2344.14 --> 2348.78]  now by your power has been made new.
[2348.78 --> 2355.78]  Gloria, Gloria, glory to God alone.
[2356.58 --> 2369.58]  Gloria, Gloria, glory to God alone.
[2369.58 --> 2380.58]  Gloria, Gloria, glory to God alone.
[2380.58 --> 2392.58]  Gloria, Gloria, glory to God alone.
[2392.58 --> 2404.90]  Good morning.
[2405.22 --> 2408.64]  My name is Mrs. Nikki, and I'd like to welcome all the kids to come forward,
[2408.78 --> 2411.58]  age three all the way up to grade four.
[2411.58 --> 2421.84]  There's just a few of us here right now.
[2422.92 --> 2424.72]  You guys get to be extra talkative.
[2425.90 --> 2426.48]  Sound good?
[2427.36 --> 2429.70]  Before we head off to children's worship time,
[2429.82 --> 2432.58]  I wanted to talk a little bit about hiking.
[2433.42 --> 2434.88]  Has anyone ever been on a hike?
[2435.68 --> 2436.04]  Yeah?
[2436.18 --> 2437.28]  A bunch of you have been on a hike?
[2437.28 --> 2437.80]  What do you do?
[2437.90 --> 2438.88]  What is a hike?
[2438.94 --> 2441.32]  In case maybe there are some people who don't know what a hike is.
[2441.74 --> 2442.08]  Karis?
[2443.26 --> 2445.10]  When you climb up a mountain, yeah?
[2445.28 --> 2447.06]  Yes, when you walk in a forest.
[2447.28 --> 2448.28]  You walk in a forest?
[2448.82 --> 2449.00]  Yeah?
[2449.74 --> 2449.98]  Yes.
[2450.34 --> 2451.24]  And you bag.
[2451.44 --> 2452.98]  You might take a bag, that's right.
[2453.08 --> 2455.20]  My dad wants to go down mountain.
[2455.92 --> 2458.34]  Oh, yeah, that's kind of like hiking except on a bike,
[2458.52 --> 2459.86]  the same area, Malachi?
[2459.86 --> 2459.96]  Malachi?
[2459.96 --> 2461.44]  You can hike?
[2461.52 --> 2463.96]  Well, there's definitely lots of trees in the forest where you're hiking.
[2464.56 --> 2467.56]  When you're hiking, usually trying to make it up to, like,
[2467.62 --> 2470.06]  maybe the top of a mountain where there's a beautiful view
[2470.06 --> 2473.82]  or maybe up to a lake where you can take a little swim
[2473.82 --> 2477.96]  or you might just want to enjoy the surroundings as you're going up.
[2479.08 --> 2481.62]  When you go hiking, something that's really important
[2481.62 --> 2484.16]  is that you stay on the path, right?
[2484.42 --> 2486.18]  There's usually a path that you have to follow.
[2486.18 --> 2487.90]  Why might you have to stay on the path?
[2489.32 --> 2490.28]  Why do we think?
[2490.80 --> 2491.06]  Levi?
[2491.06 --> 2491.18]  Levi?
[2493.96 --> 2502.62]  Oh, because there might be, that's right,
[2502.68 --> 2504.94]  there's lots of wild animals that live in the forest.
[2505.00 --> 2506.14]  We don't want to run into them.
[2506.32 --> 2507.20]  Everly, what do you think?
[2508.20 --> 2509.60]  To be safe, definitely.
[2510.24 --> 2510.64]  Karis?
[2512.82 --> 2514.78]  Yeah, so you go up to the right place in the end.
[2514.84 --> 2516.56]  So it's really important to stay on the path.
[2517.12 --> 2519.62]  So, yeah, sometimes there is.
[2519.62 --> 2521.42]  So as long as you're on the marked path,
[2521.46 --> 2523.96]  sometimes there's little, like, little diamonds on the trees
[2523.96 --> 2524.88]  so you know where you're going.
[2525.32 --> 2527.94]  So in children's worship today, we're going to talk about Jesus
[2527.94 --> 2533.08]  and how he is our path, how he is the way, the truth, and the life,
[2533.08 --> 2536.74]  and how we need to follow Jesus and stay on his path.
[2536.98 --> 2538.78]  So that's going to be our theme today.
[2539.30 --> 2542.56]  Before we go, we're going to just stand up and do our blessing,
[2542.56 --> 2544.86]  and then we're going to continue our worship.
[2572.56 --> 2576.92]  My name is Paul, and I'm an elder here,
[2577.16 --> 2580.92]  and I'd like to lead you in our family prayer.
[2585.44 --> 2587.64]  I better put my reading glasses on.
[2591.88 --> 2593.00]  Let's go to our Father.
[2593.00 --> 2593.04]  Father.
[2596.56 --> 2599.84]  Holy Father in heaven, we praise your name.
[2599.84 --> 2603.48]  We exalt you above all the earth.
[2604.68 --> 2605.60]  Holy is your name.
[2606.54 --> 2608.62]  We lift your name above all things
[2608.62 --> 2611.76]  because you have created everything that we see.
[2613.46 --> 2616.80]  Lord, we have the privilege to live in this beautiful place.
[2618.58 --> 2621.50]  We only have to look around us to see your handiwork.
[2622.36 --> 2625.66]  We give thanks for all this world and its immense beauty,
[2626.20 --> 2627.84]  its heights, its depths,
[2627.84 --> 2631.26]  the breath of it beyond our knowing.
[2632.36 --> 2634.30]  And yet you know it,
[2634.90 --> 2636.42]  and you know us.
[2637.38 --> 2638.90]  You have made yourself known.
[2640.22 --> 2643.00]  For the abundance of the gifts you give us,
[2643.08 --> 2643.70]  we thank you.
[2644.52 --> 2648.28]  For the sun and the rains that allow the land to flourish,
[2648.44 --> 2649.10]  we thank you.
[2650.26 --> 2653.82]  Your blessings are poured out on each and every one of us,
[2653.90 --> 2657.20]  regardless of what we do and how we live our lives.
[2657.84 --> 2662.42]  We thank you that also in times of disappointments and failures
[2662.42 --> 2667.20]  that lead us to acknowledge our dependence on you alone.
[2667.20 --> 2673.58]  And especially we thank you for your saving grace that you've shown us through your son,
[2673.74 --> 2674.52]  Jesus Christ.
[2675.78 --> 2679.52]  Open our hearts so that we allow your spirit to lead us,
[2679.72 --> 2682.68]  so that we may walk in your ways.
[2682.68 --> 2685.06]  With your spirit,
[2685.06 --> 2685.98]  help us to pray,
[2685.98 --> 2688.78]  because we don't know how to pray what we should,
[2689.84 --> 2693.28]  but intercede for us with sighs too deep for words.
[2695.04 --> 2697.66]  So, Lord, we come to you now with these petitions.
[2697.66 --> 2701.40]  It's Father's Day,
[2701.40 --> 2704.94]  and we thank God for the many wonderful dads in our midst.
[2705.72 --> 2706.80]  We thank you,
[2707.52 --> 2712.72]  and we ask you to bless them for continued strength and faith and health and joy.
[2712.72 --> 2717.16]  We also pray for those who struggle with absence,
[2717.68 --> 2718.08]  loss,
[2718.26 --> 2720.44]  or strained relationships with their fathers.
[2721.44 --> 2724.36]  Comfort them in their grief and loneliness.
[2725.50 --> 2731.26]  We ask that you will help them remember that you are our perfect father
[2731.26 --> 2733.96]  that has unending love and presence.
[2733.96 --> 2740.98]  We pray for the DeGroote family as they navigate this weekend without their husband,
[2741.22 --> 2741.62]  father,
[2741.82 --> 2742.46]  and grandfather,
[2742.64 --> 2742.94]  Dennis.
[2743.84 --> 2747.12]  We ask you to be near to them during this time of grief.
[2749.52 --> 2751.28]  We pray for Faye Shonit,
[2752.22 --> 2755.44]  who was in a serious car accident this past Tuesday evening.
[2756.18 --> 2758.68]  We thank you that she was not seriously injured
[2758.68 --> 2761.46]  and was able to be discharged from the hospital quickly.
[2761.46 --> 2764.92]  We ask for complete healing for Faye.
[2767.30 --> 2770.92]  We thank you that Kobe DeBorsap is doing quite well
[2770.92 --> 2772.84]  considering all that she's been through.
[2773.82 --> 2777.20]  We pray that when her chemo treatments are done,
[2777.54 --> 2779.30]  that she can go home soon.
[2781.04 --> 2784.78]  We pray that the new stem cells will truly help her body.
[2786.62 --> 2790.14]  We're thankful, along with Kern and Stephen Varsha,
[2790.14 --> 2792.58]  for some good news that they received this week.
[2793.58 --> 2797.18]  We praise you that the news of Everly scans have come back clear,
[2797.94 --> 2802.80]  and we pray for continued clear scans and the upcoming surgery,
[2803.10 --> 2806.60]  for strength on this journey and wisdom for the doctors.
[2806.60 --> 2812.34]  We thank you for the opportunities and blessings that you have provided
[2812.34 --> 2814.22]  throughout this past school year.
[2814.22 --> 2817.96]  As we approach the end of the academic year,
[2818.06 --> 2822.60]  we pray for our teachers and students that they may finish well.
[2824.10 --> 2828.00]  We also bring before you the meetings of Synod in Grand Rapids, Michigan,
[2828.00 --> 2831.94]  where many things are being discussed and decisions are being made
[2831.94 --> 2834.16]  for our denomination in North America.
[2834.16 --> 2837.96]  We pray for our pastor Chris,
[2838.10 --> 2841.90]  as he is doing the work of being a delegate for Synod this year.
[2844.74 --> 2848.18]  We ask you for your protection for this church family.
[2849.28 --> 2853.16]  We pray you will continue to bless the ongoing ministries of this church,
[2854.54 --> 2855.98]  sustain us in the present,
[2856.46 --> 2857.88]  and guide us into the future
[2857.88 --> 2861.78]  as we hear your will for us this morning
[2861.78 --> 2864.18]  through the word preached by Pastor Kevin.
[2865.00 --> 2866.90]  Bind us together in Christ.
[2868.44 --> 2870.70]  Keep us focused on our purpose
[2870.70 --> 2873.44]  and fill us with the Holy Spirit.
[2874.72 --> 2878.12]  We pray that we will grow in love and truth
[2878.12 --> 2880.66]  and righteousness and peace,
[2881.48 --> 2882.52]  hope and faith.
[2882.52 --> 2886.44]  Help us to grow in Jesus
[2886.44 --> 2889.18]  that we may become more and more like him
[2889.18 --> 2890.70]  in character and soul.
[2892.94 --> 2895.82]  Fulfill your will and purposes among us.
[2896.90 --> 2898.48]  Advance your kingdom through us
[2898.48 --> 2900.96]  so that your holy name is glorified.
[2903.24 --> 2905.62]  Who are we that we should share
[2905.62 --> 2907.58]  in your love and tender care,
[2907.90 --> 2909.50]  raised to an exalted height
[2909.50 --> 2912.48]  and crowned with honor in your sight?
[2913.48 --> 2915.06]  How great is your name!
[2916.08 --> 2917.08]  Come quickly, Lord,
[2917.24 --> 2921.32]  and bring our redemption to completeness.
[2922.96 --> 2924.92]  Gloria, Gloria,
[2925.92 --> 2927.60]  glory to God alone.
[2928.82 --> 2931.94]  We pray for all these things in your holy name.
[2932.64 --> 2932.92]  Amen.
[2942.52 --> 2954.78]  Well, last week,
[2954.96 --> 2957.38]  we finished our sermon series
[2957.38 --> 2958.64]  on the book of Romans.
[2959.20 --> 2960.94]  It only took two years,
[2961.34 --> 2962.38]  39 sermons,
[2962.52 --> 2963.26]  and a few breaks
[2963.26 --> 2964.48]  sort of scattered about.
[2965.16 --> 2966.00]  But it was good, right?
[2966.00 --> 2972.96]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, good, good, good. Because it's been a long time since, like,
[2973.00 --> 2977.66]  the schedule didn't dictate what text we were looking at, but I thought people liked it so
[2977.66 --> 2982.62]  much. If it ain't broke, why fix it? We're just going to go back to Romans 1 today and just start
[2982.62 --> 2987.58]  all over again. But then Chris said we can't do the same series twice in a row. That's not allowed.
[2987.66 --> 2992.64]  And so I thought I'd check the lectionary then on what text we should be looking at today. And
[2992.64 --> 2998.26]  there's a handful of Bible passages, but one of them was Ezekiel chapter 17. And after reading it,
[2998.30 --> 3002.06]  I thought, well, that's a pretty cool passage, and it's a little bit different than the letter
[3002.06 --> 3007.52]  writing of Paul. So we're going to look at this passage from Ezekiel this morning because I thought
[3007.52 --> 3013.14]  it was cool, and it was in the lectionary. Plus, it's Father's Day, and this passage has eagles in
[3013.14 --> 3017.98]  it, and my dad loves birds, and especially eagles, and so I thought it was fitting in that way too.
[3017.98 --> 3024.76]  So please grab your Bibles. There are some in the back as well if you need to get up and grab those.
[3025.14 --> 3032.44]  You can also open your Bible apps on your phones. That works well too. And turn to chapter 17 of
[3032.44 --> 3037.78]  Ezekiel this morning. As always, and especially today, please have that open throughout the
[3037.78 --> 3041.94]  passages. We're going to be going back to this regularly, and it's not always going to be on
[3041.94 --> 3047.26]  the screen. So to start, though, Ezekiel 17 will be up there, but I invite you to flip to that,
[3047.46 --> 3054.18]  chapter 17, and we're going to read the whole chapter this morning. So Ezekiel chapter 17.
[3055.30 --> 3062.86]  The word of the Lord came to me. Son of man, set forth an allegory and tell it to the Israelites as
[3062.86 --> 3071.50]  a parable. Say to them, this is what the sovereign Lord says. A great eagle with powerful wings, long
[3071.50 --> 3078.52]  feathers, and full plumage of varied colors came to Lebanon. Taking hold of the top of a cedar, he broke
[3078.52 --> 3084.94]  off its topmost shoot and carried it away to a land of merchants, where he planted it in a city of
[3084.94 --> 3091.92]  traders. He took one of the seedlings of the land and put it in fertile soil. He planted it like a willow
[3091.92 --> 3099.24]  by abundant water, and it sprouted and became a low-spreading vine. Its branches turned towards
[3099.24 --> 3105.96]  him, but its roots remained under it. So it became a vine and produced branches and put out leafy bows.
[3107.48 --> 3113.26]  But there was another great eagle with powerful wings and full plumage. The vine now sent out its
[3113.26 --> 3119.04]  roots toward him from the plot where it was planted and stretched out its branches to him for water.
[3119.04 --> 3124.80]  It had been planted in good soil by abundant water so that it would produce branches, bear fruit, and
[3124.80 --> 3132.28]  become a splendid vine. Say to them, this is what the sovereign Lord says, will it thrive? Will it not
[3132.28 --> 3137.24]  be uprooted and stripped of its fruit so that it withers? All its new growth will wither. It will not
[3137.24 --> 3142.80]  take a strong arm or many people to pull it by the roots. It has been planted, but will it thrive?
[3142.80 --> 3148.88]  Will it not wither completely when the east wind strikes it? Wither away in the plot where it grew.
[3150.72 --> 3154.94]  Then the word of the Lord came to me, say this to the rebellious people, do you not know what these
[3154.94 --> 3160.48]  things mean? Say to them, the king of Babylon went to Jerusalem and carried off her king and her nobles,
[3160.84 --> 3165.70]  bringing them back with him to Babylon. Then he took a member of the royal family and made a treaty with
[3165.70 --> 3170.86]  him, putting him under oath. He also carried away the leading men of the land so that the kingdom
[3170.86 --> 3179.02]  would be brought low, unable to rise again, surviving only by keeping his treaty. But the king rebelled
[3179.02 --> 3185.40]  against him by sending his envoys to Egypt to get horses and a large army. Will he succeed?
[3186.86 --> 3195.32]  Will he who does such things escape? Will he break the treaty and yet escape? As surely as I live,
[3195.38 --> 3200.44]  declares the sovereign Lord, he shall die in Babylon, in the land of the king who put him on the throne,
[3200.44 --> 3205.86]  whose oath he despised and whose treaty he broke. Pharaoh with his mighty army and great horde will
[3205.86 --> 3212.20]  be of no help to him in war. When ramps are built and siege works erected to destroy many lives,
[3212.92 --> 3218.08]  he despised the oath by breaking the covenant because he had given his hand in pledge and yet
[3218.08 --> 3224.10]  did all these things, he shall not escape. Therefore, this is what the sovereign Lord says,
[3224.18 --> 3230.30]  as surely as I live, I will repay him for despising my oath and breaking my covenant. I will spread my net
[3230.30 --> 3237.66]  for him and he will be caught in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon and execute judgment on him
[3237.66 --> 3242.90]  there because he was unfaithful to me. All his choice troops will fall by the sword and the
[3242.90 --> 3247.68]  survivors will be scattered to the winds. Then you will know that I, the Lord, have spoken.
[3249.26 --> 3255.10]  This is what the sovereign Lord says, I myself will take a shoot from the very top of a cedar and plant it.
[3255.10 --> 3261.74]  I will break off a tender sprig from its topmost shoots and plant it on a high lofty mountain. On
[3261.74 --> 3266.86]  the mountain heights of Israel, I will plant it. It will produce branches and bear fruit and become a
[3266.86 --> 3272.76]  splendid cedar. Birds of every kind will nest in it. They will find their shelter in the shade of its
[3272.76 --> 3277.98]  branches. All the trees of the forest will know that I, the Lord, bring down the tall tree and make
[3277.98 --> 3286.88]  the low tree grow tall. I dry up the green tree and I make the dry tree flourish. I, the Lord, have spoken
[3286.88 --> 3297.48]  and I will do it. The word of the Lord. I told you it was kind of a cool passage. So what's going on here?
[3297.48 --> 3306.66]  What is happening that Ezekiel writes this passage and that God tells Ezekiel to tell this parable?
[3307.56 --> 3312.74]  So a little bit of Bible history here before we get too far. Just stick with me while we lay down a
[3312.74 --> 3319.32]  little bit of a foundation. So at this point in time, the people of Israel are in a bit of a mess.
[3320.34 --> 3327.34]  About 330 years earlier, the nation of Israel split into two nations, Israel and Judah.
[3327.48 --> 3333.40]  Israel made up the 10 tribes to the north and Judah made up two tribes to the south. It's kind of like
[3333.40 --> 3338.22]  Langley City and Langley Township. They both had their own residents, their own systems, their own
[3338.22 --> 3347.04]  kings. We call them mayors. The 10 tribes to the north, called the nation of Israel, they had an awful
[3347.04 --> 3352.50]  run. They never had a faithful king. They were terrible. They were disobedient. They were all very
[3352.50 --> 3360.84]  sinful. And eventually in 721 BC, Assyria just comes sweeping through and takes them out. They're
[3360.84 --> 3366.28]  either wiped out, they're integrated into Assyrian culture, and we don't hear from them again. That's
[3366.28 --> 3375.20]  the end of their story. The two southern tribes though, Judah, they were still pretty terrible. But at least
[3375.20 --> 3383.84]  they had a few good and faithful kings. And so they survived a little bit longer. But in 597 BC, Babylon
[3383.84 --> 3390.90]  comes to Nakan and overtakes them as well. And the people of Judah are taken captive to Babylon. Now they
[3390.90 --> 3398.88]  aren't wiped out completely like Israel was, but they're in exile to the Babylonians. Ezekiel, the prophet
[3398.88 --> 3405.48]  whose passage we just read today, Ezekiel is a prophet to God's people during this time, during this time
[3405.48 --> 3411.34]  in exile. And now one last thing that's important to this text. While this passage today was written
[3411.34 --> 3417.20]  to God's people who are already in captivity, they were already in exile, and life wasn't looking great,
[3417.86 --> 3425.16]  it also wasn't as bad as it was going to get. They were still in somewhat of a soft exile, if you can
[3425.16 --> 3433.04]  call it that. The worst was still to come. And in fact, today's passage is about Ezekiel warning God's
[3433.04 --> 3440.38]  people of exactly that. See, Ezekiel writes this passage, this parable is told in order to tell God's
[3440.38 --> 3447.66]  people that Babylon, that their very exile that they're in, was being used as an instrument of God's
[3447.66 --> 3455.04]  plan, promise, and judgment for their sins. Ezekiel is warning them that all of this punishment is
[3455.04 --> 3462.44]  God's plan. So trying to circumvent any of it won't work. Because of their unfaithfulness, because of
[3462.44 --> 3469.10]  their wickedness, because they followed and worshiped other gods over the one true God, Judah needed to be
[3469.10 --> 3482.60]  in exile to the Babylonians. Exile was the plan. Exile was God's plan. Now in many ways, Ezekiel, if you read
[3482.60 --> 3489.02]  his whole book, it's long, but it's fascinating, Ezekiel throughout his book is actually pro-Babylon,
[3489.20 --> 3494.18]  which sounds weird, but he says throughout the book over and over again that the Babylonians are an
[3494.18 --> 3502.60]  instrument in which God was bringing judgment, and that judgment could not be stopped. But, but,
[3502.60 --> 3511.42]  God was also working in and through the exile of his people to bring forward his redemption plan.
[3512.56 --> 3522.10]  The big idea from our text is that God's plan always plays out. God's plan always plays out.
[3524.40 --> 3529.22]  Today's text both foreshadows the judgment that was always going to come about and tells of a
[3529.22 --> 3534.42]  redemption plan that was already in the works. So let's look at this text then. Let's take a look
[3534.42 --> 3540.28]  at what we just read from Ezekiel 17. It's actually very conveniently broken into three parts for us,
[3540.40 --> 3547.22]  which is handy. So verses 3 to 10 is the parable that God tells Ezekiel to bring to the people.
[3547.92 --> 3555.50]  Verses 11 to 21 is an explanation of that parable. And verses 22 to 24 is a promise for all people.
[3555.50 --> 3559.34]  So we're going to look at the parable first. We'll do this in order. That makes good sense.
[3559.60 --> 3565.04]  Take a look at verses 3 to 10 with me again. So here's the parable. An eagle comes, a big,
[3565.40 --> 3571.98]  beautiful eagle, colorful plumage, long feathers, powerful wings, and this eagle heads into Lebanon,
[3572.40 --> 3578.16]  which was a part of Israel at the time. And it takes the topmost shoot of a cedar in its beak.
[3578.16 --> 3586.08]  He flies back and plants it into fertile soil ground by running water. Now the shoot that it
[3586.08 --> 3592.22]  plants, it sprouts, and it turns into this low spreading vine with branches. Now that vine grows,
[3592.66 --> 3600.28]  and it grows low, and it reaches towards the eagle that planted it. All right, it didn't grow tall,
[3600.78 --> 3606.70]  but it did grow low to the ground, and it produced roots and leafy bows and reaches to the eagle that
[3606.70 --> 3615.04]  planted it. But there was another eagle, which lets me use that very popular saying that we've been
[3615.04 --> 3621.90]  using for millennia, there's always another eagle. Hasn't been used. I'm making it up today. We're
[3621.90 --> 3629.12]  going to let it stick. It's going to take off. I know it. Well, this other eagle, it was also great.
[3629.50 --> 3633.84]  It had powerful wings. It had full plumage. But look at the text. Notice in verse 7,
[3633.84 --> 3640.80]  the eagle actually doesn't do anything. It really doesn't do much. This eagle just sits there.
[3641.90 --> 3648.64]  But that vine that was planted starts to reach out and grow towards this other eagle.
[3649.36 --> 3655.42]  There's always another eagle. This vine starts sending its roots towards this other eagle, and the
[3655.42 --> 3662.44]  vine starts to weaken. The Lord then asks Israel in verses 9 and 10, what's going to happen to that vine?
[3662.44 --> 3668.66]  It's not going to thrive. In fact, it's going to wither. Its new growth and its fruit will be
[3668.66 --> 3673.90]  stripped, and it wouldn't even take a strong arm or many people to pull it out of the ground and
[3673.90 --> 3680.40]  destroy it. All because that vine started looking towards another eagle. There's always another eagle.
[3681.82 --> 3688.00]  So because it looked towards that other eagle, the vine would be destroyed. So that's the parable
[3688.00 --> 3693.88]  that's told in verses 3 to 10. But what does it mean? Well, again, fortunately for us,
[3694.50 --> 3700.82]  this parable gets explained to us in the next 10, 11 verses. Verses 11 to 21, explain it for us. You
[3700.82 --> 3705.76]  can take a peek with me. Follow along there, starting in verse 11. So the two eagles in this story,
[3705.96 --> 3712.78]  they represent two nations, all right? Babylon and Egypt, or Nebuchadnezzar, which is Babylon's king,
[3712.78 --> 3720.70]  and Pharaoh, which is Egypt's king. Now the first eagle, Babylon, went into Lebanon and made its way
[3720.70 --> 3726.86]  towards Jerusalem, which is represented by this giant cedar tree. So Jerusalem is the giant cedar tree.
[3727.30 --> 3733.06]  Babylon then, or sorry, yeah, Babylon then took the topmost shoot of the cedar, the topmost shoot
[3733.06 --> 3740.56]  of Jerusalem, which our text in verse 12 says is the king and all of its noble people. Takes them from
[3740.56 --> 3746.88]  Judah, and the eagle brings them back to Babylon to the fertile ground. Now this eagle, you'll see in
[3746.88 --> 3754.20]  verse 5 of our text, he takes this seedling from this shoot. And in this case, it's referring to a
[3754.20 --> 3761.58]  king named Zedekiah, all right? And he plants that king, he plants that seedling in fertile ground. So in
[3761.58 --> 3767.66]  essence, this is what Babylon did. This is what they did, was they went to Jerusalem, and they brought all
[3767.66 --> 3773.20]  its kings, all its leaders, all its nobles back with them to Babylon, and then put a guy named Zedekiah
[3773.20 --> 3780.56]  in charge of Judah, with no power, no military, and a sworn oath or treaty that they were going to lead
[3780.56 --> 3787.82]  and follow Nebuchadnezzar. And that's what happened. That's the context of the people of God that they
[3787.82 --> 3791.64]  found themselves in. They had been captured by Babylon, and they were living under the thumb of
[3791.64 --> 3798.06]  Nebuchadnezzar, but they were still like ruled, giant air quotes, by Zedekiah, even though he had
[3798.06 --> 3804.98]  no power, no military, no political sway. He was a puppet king. He was in charge, but with no power. He
[3804.98 --> 3810.64]  could only operate under the command of the puppet master of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar.
[3811.72 --> 3818.16]  Now the parable tells us how the kingdom of Judah could still grow. The Babylonian soil was rich,
[3818.16 --> 3823.14]  but it was never going to be able to rise. It could only function by keeping the treaty with
[3823.14 --> 3828.12]  Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. It could function as long as it looked towards Babylon, as long as it looked
[3828.12 --> 3834.08]  towards Babylon for support, for everything. And all of that is explained in verses 12 to 14 of our text.
[3835.60 --> 3843.92]  But there's always another eagle. Now this other eagle, Egypt, doesn't do anything. Egypt just sits
[3843.92 --> 3852.12]  there, but it's beautiful, and it's powerful, and it's alluring to this vine, Zedekiah, this puppet king.
[3852.44 --> 3858.14]  This puppet king starts to look towards Egypt, starts to reach towards Egypt, looking for some help,
[3858.64 --> 3862.36]  looking for some help from this other nation in order to rebel against Babylon.
[3863.12 --> 3868.06]  It didn't have a military to rebel itself, so they started looking to Egypt for help.
[3868.06 --> 3873.16]  And that's the end of the story. That's the end of the explanation of the parable.
[3873.86 --> 3878.00]  The end of the story hasn't happened yet, but the question then shows up in our text again in verse
[3878.00 --> 3884.84]  14. Will he succeed? Will he be able to find help from Egypt and overthrow Babylon? What's going to
[3884.84 --> 3892.40]  happen to the vine? And again, God answers these questions. Just like the vine in the parable will
[3892.40 --> 3900.60]  wither up and die, because it spread its roots towards another eagle, there's always another
[3900.60 --> 3908.96]  eagle. Just like the vine withers up, so too this king will be destroyed. God exclaims. Look at verse
[3908.96 --> 3915.04]  16 and 17 of our text today. As surely as I live, declares the Lord, he, that is Zedekiah,
[3915.64 --> 3920.90]  shall die in Babylon in the land of the king who put him on the throne, whose oath he despised,
[3920.90 --> 3927.86]  and whose treaty he broke. Pharaoh with his mighty army and great horde will be of no help to him in
[3927.86 --> 3936.30]  war when ramps are built and siege works erected to destroy many lives. So God, through Ezekiel,
[3936.36 --> 3943.08]  is warning Zedekiah and warning all of the people of Israel that Babylon was being used as an
[3943.08 --> 3949.10]  instrument of God's plan, promise, and judgment for their sins. This exile was not meant to be
[3949.10 --> 3954.72]  circumvented, and any attempts to do so, any attempts to look anywhere else for help, was going to be
[3954.72 --> 3960.98]  met with destruction. If Zedekiah was going to look to Egypt to help him out in this exile,
[3961.38 --> 3969.54]  he was going to fail, and it was going to be bad. So what happened? Like in real life, what happened,
[3969.54 --> 3977.58]  you may be asking. So today's text, this Ezekiel 17 passage, was likely written around 591 or 590 BC,
[3977.58 --> 3984.18]  the sixth or seventh year of exile in Babylon. We know that because in Ezekiel chapter 8,
[3984.90 --> 3989.80]  so nine chapters earlier, it says that they were in the sixth year of exile, and then in Ezekiel
[3989.80 --> 3994.74]  chapter 20, which is three chapters after this text, they are in their seventh year of exile,
[3994.86 --> 3999.32]  it says. And then this text falls in between that, so we can know that to be true. We also know that
[3999.32 --> 4006.28]  exile started in 597 BC because history tells us that. Both the Babylonian Nebuchadnezzar
[4006.28 --> 4010.94]  Chronicle, which is a tablet that was discovered that had Babylonian history written on it,
[4011.10 --> 4017.80]  as well as the Bible in 2 Kings 24, 10 to 16, they teach us that. Those dates align. So the dates
[4017.80 --> 4023.72]  align, and it's known historically to be true. So this parable is written and spoken in about 590-ish BC,
[4023.88 --> 4030.24]  which is right around the time when King Zedekiah, that puppet king in Judah, starts looking to Egypt
[4030.24 --> 4037.22]  for help. Well, historically, despite the warnings in this parable, Zedekiah keeps looking towards Egypt,
[4037.56 --> 4044.48]  and he gets nothing from them. Worse than that, Nebuchadnezzar finds out that Zedekiah was looking
[4044.48 --> 4052.88]  towards Egypt for help, and you can read a very rough, very aggressive story in 2 Kings 25, verses 1 to 7,
[4053.06 --> 4059.08]  that details the demise of Zedekiah for doing that. Feel free to read it, though if this was a movie,
[4059.08 --> 4067.18]  it would likely come with an 18A rating. Basically, I'll sum it up, for two years, Babylon surrounds the
[4067.18 --> 4071.96]  city of Jerusalem with their siege weaponry, which again, check verse 17 of our text today,
[4072.22 --> 4077.78]  says it would happen. They surround Jerusalem with their siege weaponry and cause a major famine
[4077.78 --> 4083.40]  and drought in the city. Eventually, with Jerusalem cut off from the outside world, from all food and
[4083.40 --> 4088.76]  water, the Babylonians enter and take over the city. All of Zedekiah's army and family were either
[4088.76 --> 4093.46]  killed or scattered, and Zedekiah, for his disobedience to God and his disobedience to
[4093.46 --> 4101.12]  Nebuchadnezzar, was tortured and killed. This all comes to fruition in 587 BC, which is three years
[4101.12 --> 4113.48]  after this Ezekiel 17 text. Now, in many ways, this is a very hard parable to hear, to read, especially
[4113.48 --> 4118.52]  because the warnings that were dished out in the parable were not heeded, and the exile only got
[4118.52 --> 4126.74]  worse and worse for God's people. But remember all along that God was telling his people that Babylon
[4126.74 --> 4135.02]  was being used as an instrument for his plan. God's plan always plays out.
[4137.34 --> 4146.04]  Also, at the end of our text, we hear about this glorious promise. Verses 22 to 24 of our text
[4146.04 --> 4153.28]  details that promise. It says this, this is God speaking, he says, I myself will take a shoot from
[4153.28 --> 4158.90]  the very top of a cedar and plant it. I will break off a tender sprig from its topmost shoots and
[4158.90 --> 4164.56]  plant it on a high and lofty mountain. On the mountain heights of Israel, I will plant it. It
[4164.56 --> 4171.40]  will produce branches and bear fruit and become a splendid cedar. Birds of every kind will nest in it.
[4172.26 --> 4176.82]  They will find shelter in the shade of its branches. All the trees of the forest will know that I,
[4176.96 --> 4183.16]  the Lord, bring down the tall cedar and make the low tree grow tall. I dry up the green tree and make
[4183.16 --> 4192.98]  the dry tree flourish. I myself, the Lord says, I myself will take a shoot. He's using the same
[4192.98 --> 4197.48]  imagery here as he used in the parable, except instead of an eagle swooping in and planting it,
[4197.56 --> 4203.78]  he's going to do it. God's going to do it. He will plant a tender sprig on a mountain and it will turn
[4203.78 --> 4211.44]  into a new cedar, a new city. It will be so magnificent, so tall, so beautiful that birds of
[4211.44 --> 4220.74]  every kind will nest in its branches. God loves to use tree and vine imagery in his word. And
[4220.74 --> 4226.24]  throughout scripture, we see it everywhere. In the Old Testament, if you read 1 Kings 4, verses 25,
[4226.34 --> 4232.04]  it talks about how all of Israel and Judah lived in the safety under their own vines and their own
[4232.04 --> 4238.48]  fig trees, at least for a while. In Hosea 10, verse 1, it speaks of Israel again and it says,
[4238.48 --> 4244.28]  Israel was spreading the vine and it brought forth fruit for himself. Again, at least for a little
[4244.28 --> 4250.06]  while. Ezekiel 19, verses 10 and 11, just two chapters after the text that we read today, speaks
[4250.06 --> 4255.40]  of branches and vines again when it describes Israel as a vine in your vineyard planted by the water.
[4255.64 --> 4261.86]  It was fruitful, full of branches because of abundant water. Its branches were strong, fit for a rule
[4261.86 --> 4269.98]  scepter. Once again, at least for a little while. See, in each of those verses, Israel starts off as the
[4269.98 --> 4275.42]  vine and the branches that were healthy and strong, but eventually they turn away from God and they start
[4275.42 --> 4282.24]  bearing no fruit. They were uprooted, they were destroyed. But the branch and vine imagery changes a
[4282.24 --> 4287.42]  little bit in the New Testament. See, it's no longer Israel that's the vine, it's Jesus that becomes the
[4287.42 --> 4294.66]  ultimate vine that never weakens. John 15, 1 to 4, I am the vine, I am the true vine, and my Father is the
[4294.66 --> 4301.24]  gardener. Remain in me as I remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself, it must remain in the vine.
[4301.58 --> 4308.84]  Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me. In the promise of Ezekiel 17, Jesus is the tender
[4308.84 --> 4316.24]  sprig that gets planted on the high hill. He is the true vine, the only one that never gets uprooted. It is
[4316.24 --> 4322.32]  only when we remain in Him that the vine, in that vine, that we produce good fruit.
[4324.10 --> 4330.24]  The kingdom of God also gets described as branches. We read in Matthew 13, 31 to 32,
[4330.24 --> 4336.04]  the kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and planted in its field. Though it is the
[4336.04 --> 4340.92]  smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree
[4340.92 --> 4348.30]  so that the birds come and perch in its branches. So this kingdom of God becomes this massive tree
[4348.30 --> 4353.92]  that the birds come and nest. This is a direct correlation to this parable that we read of in
[4353.92 --> 4362.10]  Ezekiel. The tender sprig, Jesus came down and was planted in this world. He lived this perfect life
[4362.10 --> 4368.94]  that you and I fail to live each and every day. And then Jesus died a death that you and I deserved.
[4368.94 --> 4374.32]  But three days later, He rose again from the grave. He defeated sin and death forever. And now,
[4374.56 --> 4379.76]  whoever calls on His name as the Savior and Redeemer of the world can rest in His branches
[4379.76 --> 4386.32]  and know that they are saved forevermore. And more than that, when we remain in Him,
[4386.48 --> 4391.54]  we have purpose in this world too, to bear His fruit and never wither and never die.
[4391.54 --> 4402.36]  Our identities are rooted in Him. Our purpose is found in Him. Our hope is Him. He is the mighty vine
[4402.36 --> 4409.60]  which we can root ourselves in. He is the mighty tree who welcomes the birds of all kinds,
[4409.92 --> 4416.90]  people of every nation's into. See, this is the glorious promise that is found at the end of Ezekiel 17.
[4416.90 --> 4422.72]  And this is the glorious promise that came to fruition already in Jesus' life, death, and resurrection.
[4423.34 --> 4427.28]  We have the privilege here today of living on the other side of that promise.
[4429.02 --> 4435.02]  We know that Jesus lives. We know that He reigns and we know that we are united in Him,
[4435.34 --> 4441.94]  grafted into His vine, bearing fruit in His name. The root has been planted. The vine has extended.
[4441.94 --> 4448.30]  The birds have been invited. The victory has been won. God's plan always plays out.
[4451.30 --> 4454.42]  However, we are not Israel here.
[4457.22 --> 4462.46]  I think oftentimes when we read a text like Ezekiel 17 and we try to apply it to our lives,
[4462.52 --> 4469.04]  we think, oh, how am I in exile? How is God using this exile as an instrument of His plan like He did
[4469.04 --> 4475.20]  for Israel? How is He using my exile? How is He using my burdens? What are my burdens? And how is
[4475.20 --> 4484.82]  God judging me for wandering from His plan? But that's the wrong question. We aren't in exile like
[4484.82 --> 4491.74]  Israel was, at least not in the same sense. The Israelites' exile in Babylon was contextual and
[4491.74 --> 4497.68]  historically unique to them. God isn't punishing His people here in Langley as part of His plan to
[4497.68 --> 4505.42]  redeem us like He was Israel. He's already redeemed us. That's happened already. Christ has already
[4505.42 --> 4512.80]  come. Redemption is already here. See, the promise in Ezekiel has already been fulfilled,
[4513.42 --> 4517.94]  and it's going to be fulfilled in its completion when Christ comes back again to bring in the new
[4517.94 --> 4526.26]  heaven and the new earth. We don't have to fear judgment because Christ already paid the penalty.
[4526.26 --> 4537.08]  The judge took the judgment. The Israelites in this text today were trying to circumvent God's judgment
[4537.08 --> 4543.60]  to escape exile. The wonderful news for us today is that we don't have to circumvent judgment because
[4543.60 --> 4551.12]  there's no judgment to circumvent for believers. Christ took the punishment. Christ bore the judgment.
[4551.12 --> 4565.68]  But here's the unique rub here. Because of that, we choose exile. We choose to live in exile.
[4566.90 --> 4571.40]  We choose to live in exile? Wait, what? That can't be right. The Israelites didn't choose their exile.
[4571.56 --> 4575.64]  God chose that for them, and it was a punishment. It was a judgment. I thought we were free from judgment.
[4575.64 --> 4582.34]  Yes, but remember, our context is different than Israel. We're on the other side of this promise.
[4586.00 --> 4590.32]  We're going to read a little bit from 1 Peter today. I loved it because we used it as our assurance
[4590.32 --> 4595.50]  this morning, at least parts of it, but look at 1 Peter chapters 1 and 2 for me today. Right out of
[4595.50 --> 4602.52]  the gate, 1 Peter 1 verse 1, to God's elect, exiles scattered throughout the provinces who have been
[4602.52 --> 4607.52]  chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father to be obedient to Jesus Christ and sprinkled
[4607.52 --> 4612.64]  with His blood. Grace and peace be yours in abundance. We are addressed as exiles right out
[4612.64 --> 4618.56]  of the gate. A little bit later, verses 17 and 18. Since you are called on a father, or since you call
[4618.56 --> 4624.72]  on a father who judges each person's work importantly, live out your time as foreigners here, can be
[4624.72 --> 4630.90]  translated as exiles, in reverent fear. For you know that it was not with perishable things such as gold or
[4630.90 --> 4635.92]  silver that you were redeemed from the empty way of life, handed down to you from your ancestors,
[4636.46 --> 4644.16]  but with the precious blood of Jesus Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect. And then one more
[4644.16 --> 4650.40]  chunk, just a little bit later, over in chapter 2, verses 11 and 12. Dear friends, I urge you as
[4650.40 --> 4658.62]  foreigners and exiles to abstain from sinful desires which wage war against your soul. Live such good lives
[4658.62 --> 4664.04]  among the pagans that though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify
[4664.04 --> 4672.58]  God on the day He visits us. Peter is telling us that we are called to live our lives as exiles here
[4672.58 --> 4679.32]  on earth, not trusting in perishable things such as gold or silver, but abstaining from the comforts
[4679.32 --> 4685.72]  of this world and living such model lives, both in word and deed, so that those who do not call Christ
[4685.72 --> 4691.54]  as their Savior will have nothing bad to say about us and will come to desire the life-giving source
[4691.54 --> 4702.88]  of the vine. We do not fear judgment, but we do choose exile, exile from the comforts of the world,
[4703.56 --> 4715.20]  remaining in His branches. We abide in Him as fruit-bearing branches. We don't abide in the world,
[4715.20 --> 4722.82]  we abide in the word, and that makes us exiles, strangers, ambassadors for the kingdom of God.
[4723.62 --> 4730.54]  See, there's many, many who desire to reach out, to lean into, to grow towards the comforts and
[4730.54 --> 4739.20]  distractions of this world. For them, there's always another eagle, but the world offers this comfort
[4739.20 --> 4747.44]  that's false and idols and distractions that are so compelling to reach towards. But Jesus changes
[4747.44 --> 4755.96]  everything. Once we know the true power of salvation that comes from the gospel truth of Jesus' life,
[4756.10 --> 4761.18]  death, and resurrection, we don't have to fear death. We don't have to fear judgment.
[4761.18 --> 4771.76]  We get to live for eternal glory, and we choose exile. We choose to be grafted into Jesus, not grafted
[4771.76 --> 4778.88]  into the world anymore. And so may we abide in the life-giving branches of our Lord, attached to the
[4778.88 --> 4786.80]  promise that He is the vine. We remain in Him. We are united with Him, and we fear no judgment. We choose
[4786.80 --> 4796.90]  exile with Jesus instead of the eagles of this world. Because the root's been planted, the vine has
[4796.90 --> 4803.00]  extended, the birds have been invited, and the victory over sin and death has been won. In our case,
[4803.12 --> 4810.66]  church, there is no other eagle. If you know that Jesus' life, death, and resurrection has changed
[4810.66 --> 4819.54]  everything, then you can rest assured knowing that you are part of God's eternal kingdom plan all along.
[4820.40 --> 4829.20]  And that's the greatest news ever, because God's plan always plays out. Amen? Let's pray.
[4833.54 --> 4840.34]  Father in heaven, God, we know that you are a sovereign God ruling over all things.
[4841.06 --> 4847.44]  We know that you have had a plan all along to save and redeem creation. We know that that plan
[4847.44 --> 4854.34]  started with Abraham and moved through a nation, became this nation of Israel, and led us to Jesus,
[4855.34 --> 4861.06]  who lived and died and rose again, ascended to heaven, and now seated, intermediating on our behalf.
[4862.50 --> 4867.22]  Lord, that plan is always played out, and we know that you will come again to bring in the new heaven
[4867.22 --> 4872.44]  and the new earth. Lord, we know that if we believe that, if we believe in your Son,
[4873.26 --> 4878.76]  that we are saved, that we are grafted into the vine, and we bear fruit in his name.
[4879.94 --> 4887.78]  Lord, thank you for that plan. And God, in our day to day, as we go from this place into our weeks,
[4887.78 --> 4893.22]  whether that's to work, to school, in our homes, on our soccer fields, or baseball diamonds,
[4893.48 --> 4901.16]  wherever we find ourselves, Lord, may we know that we are a part of that plan.
[4901.16 --> 4910.70]  And may we respond in obedience. May we respond in grateful obedience to how you call us to live
[4910.70 --> 4918.60]  our lives, not to save us, but because we are saved. And may the world around us know that you
[4918.60 --> 4925.82]  are God by what we say and what we do, and may they be drawn to you, the vine, as well. Lord,
[4925.82 --> 4928.86]  we pray this in your Son's precious and holy name. Amen.
[4928.86 --> 4928.96]  Amen.
[4928.96 --> 4928.98]  Amen.
[4955.82 --> 4956.56]  Amen.
[4985.82 --> 4992.44]  My sin weighed upon your shoulders
[4992.44 --> 4997.14]  My soul now to stand
[4997.14 --> 5004.00]  So what can I say?
[5006.14 --> 5010.50]  And what can I do?
[5010.50 --> 5019.96]  I offer this heart, O God
[5019.96 --> 5025.50]  Completely to you
[5026.14 --> 5034.48]  So I'll walk upon salvation
[5034.48 --> 5041.80]  Your spirit alive in me
[5041.80 --> 5047.94]  My life to declare your promise
[5047.94 --> 5051.58]  My soul now to stand
[5051.58 --> 5057.04]  So what can I say?
[5061.04 --> 5064.04]  And what can I do?
[5064.04 --> 5073.50]  I offer this heart, O God
[5073.50 --> 5078.50]  Completely to you
[5078.50 --> 5083.50]  So what can I say?
[5083.50 --> 5089.96]  What can I do?
[5092.96 --> 5097.96]  I offer this heart, O God
[5097.96 --> 5102.96]  Completely to you
[5102.96 --> 5117.16]  So I'll stand
[5117.16 --> 5120.96]  With heart's high and heart abandoned
[5120.96 --> 5127.42]  In awe of the one who gave it all
[5127.42 --> 5132.12]  I'll stand, my soul, Lord
[5132.12 --> 5134.46]  To you surrendered all
[5134.46 --> 5136.88]  My hand is yours
[5136.88 --> 5142.70]  And I'll stand
[5142.70 --> 5146.42]  With heart's high and heart abandoned
[5146.42 --> 5153.26]  In awe of the one who gave it all

[5337.60 --> 5341.56]  His gift of love and righteousness
[5341.56 --> 5347.32]  Scored by the ones He gave to save
[5347.32 --> 5352.34]  Till on their cross as Jesus died
[5352.34 --> 5357.40]  No wrath of God was satisfied
[5357.40 --> 5362.70]  For every sin on Him was laid
[5362.70 --> 5368.40]  Here in the death of Christ I live
[5368.40 --> 5382.40]  There in the ground His body lay
[5382.40 --> 5387.46]  Light of the world by darkness slain
[5387.46 --> 5392.64]  Then bursting forth in glorious day
[5392.64 --> 5396.40]  Up from the pretty rose again
[5396.40 --> 5401.46]  And as He stands in victory
[5401.46 --> 5406.40]  Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
[5407.16 --> 5412.40]  For I am His and He is mine
[5412.40 --> 5417.72]  Father, the precious blood of Christ
[5417.72 --> 5432.48]  No guilt in life, no fear in death

[5452.88 --> 5457.86]  In ever love He brought His hand
[5457.86 --> 5462.78]  To leave His hand for those below
[5462.78 --> 5467.72]  Here in the power of Christ I stand

[5473.60 --> 5478.72]  Can ever block me from His hand
[5478.72 --> 5484.72]  Till He returns or calls me home
[5484.72 --> 5490.72]  Here in the power of Christ I stand
