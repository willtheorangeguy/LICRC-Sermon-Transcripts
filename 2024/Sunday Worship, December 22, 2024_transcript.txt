[2249.76 --> 2279.74]  Thank you.
[2279.76 --> 2309.74]  Thank you.
[2309.76 --> 2339.76]  Christ.
[2339.76 --> 2369.74]  Thank you.
[2369.76 --> 2399.74]  Thank you.
[2399.76 --> 2429.74]  Thank you.
[2429.76 --> 2459.74]  Thank you.
[2459.74 --> 2489.72]  Hi, everyone.
[2489.72 --> 2519.70]  Thank you.
[2519.70 --> 2549.68]  Thank you.
[2549.68 --> 2579.66]  That's King, that's King,
[2579.66 --> 2609.64]  Oh, isn't that you, yeah.
[2609.64 --> 2639.62]  Yeah, all that work.
[2639.62 --> 2669.62]  Thank you.
[2669.62 --> 2699.60]  Thank you.
[2699.62 --> 2729.60]  Thank you.
[2729.62 --> 2759.62]  Thank you.
[2759.64 --> 2789.60]  Thank you.
[2789.60 --> 2819.60]  Thank you.
[2819.60 --> 2849.58]  Thank you.
[2849.60 --> 2879.60]  So, I need to ask you, I need to ask you, I'm going to ask you, I need to ask you, I need to ask you,
[2879.60 --> 2909.60] 
[2909.60 --> 2919.60]  ourselves there, but you're not here.
[2919.60 --> 2926.26]  No, there is always more that can be said about love and especially the love of God.
[2927.14 --> 2932.14]  And specifically, we will be narrowing down to one aspect of God's love,
[2932.36 --> 2937.10]  something that blends this passage of Isaiah today into our modern context and into our lives.
[2937.78 --> 2940.00]  The main point of today's sermon is this.
[2940.94 --> 2946.74]  The love the Father has for his Son is the love God has for you.
[2946.74 --> 2953.96]  The same love of God for his Son is the same love of God for you.
[2955.58 --> 2962.44]  And how that idea relates to the passage today from Isaiah and Matthew won't be obvious at the beginning,
[2962.76 --> 2965.38]  but it will start to become clear as we dive in.
[2965.78 --> 2968.76]  And so I ask you to follow me as we go on a bit of an adventure.
[2970.74 --> 2976.04]  Today, we will be learning about love from Isaiah 42, verses 1 to 9.
[2976.04 --> 2979.68]  And Matthew 12, verses 15 to 21.
[2980.04 --> 2981.70]  But we will get to Matthew later.
[2982.26 --> 2985.32]  So open up your Bibles, your devices to Isaiah 42, 1 to 9,
[2985.52 --> 2988.96]  and we will begin another Advent sermon on love.
[2988.96 --> 2997.56]  Here is my servant whom I uphold, my chosen one in whom I delight.
[2998.26 --> 3002.04]  I will put my spirit on him, and he will bring justice to the nations.
[3002.64 --> 3006.48]  He will not shout or cry out or raise his voice in the streets.
[3007.18 --> 3011.56]  A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out.
[3011.56 --> 3015.20]  In faithfulness, he will bring forth justice.
[3015.72 --> 3020.32]  He will not falter or be discouraged till he establishes justice on the earth.
[3021.12 --> 3023.78]  In his teachings, the islands will put their hope.
[3024.68 --> 3027.86]  This is what God, the Lord, says, the creator of heavens and earth,
[3028.36 --> 3033.88]  who stretches them out, who spreads out the earth with all that springs from it,
[3034.04 --> 3039.62]  who gives breath to its people, and of life to those who walk on it.
[3039.62 --> 3042.42]  I, the Lord, have called you in righteousness.
[3043.02 --> 3044.92]  I will take hold of your hand.
[3045.38 --> 3048.54]  I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people
[3048.54 --> 3052.36]  and a light for the Gentiles, to open the eyes that are blind,
[3052.70 --> 3057.60]  to free captives from prison, and to release from the dungeon those who sit in darkness.
[3058.44 --> 3060.60]  I am the Lord, that is my name.
[3060.86 --> 3064.86]  I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols.
[3065.50 --> 3068.88]  See, the former things have taken place and new things I declare.
[3068.88 --> 3072.88]  Before they spring up into being, I announce them to you.
[3073.88 --> 3074.94]  The word of the Lord.
[3078.48 --> 3082.80]  When reading this passage, it's important to note that there are two sections.
[3083.36 --> 3087.98]  The first section is verses 1 to 4, where God is describing his servant
[3087.98 --> 3090.44]  and what his character is like and what he will be like.
[3090.92 --> 3094.56]  Here is my servant whom I uphold, my chosen one in whom I delight.
[3094.56 --> 3101.30]  In the second section, verses 5 to 9, God is speaking about his relationship with this servant
[3101.30 --> 3104.00]  and what he will do for and with him.
[3104.10 --> 3105.84]  He's speaking to the servant.
[3106.78 --> 3110.84]  I, the Lord, have called you in righteousness, and I will take hold of your hand.
[3110.84 --> 3116.34]  So, in the first section, God starts off by introducing this figure
[3116.34 --> 3119.82]  and introducing him as someone who he upholds and delights.
[3120.50 --> 3124.68]  This servant, this chosen one, is an individual who God takes pleasure in
[3124.68 --> 3129.20]  and who God actively makes sure that he accomplishes the thing for which he sent him.
[3129.20 --> 3134.00]  God is the source of this man's strength and good character.
[3134.50 --> 3137.32]  And it goes on to add that God will put his spirit upon him.
[3137.84 --> 3139.20]  And what will he do?
[3139.66 --> 3141.86]  He will bring justice to the nations.
[3143.06 --> 3147.22]  Now, if you're an Israelite from that time in which Isaiah is writing,
[3147.86 --> 3150.04]  it means that your prayers have been answered.
[3150.68 --> 3152.24]  The line of David has arrived.
[3152.46 --> 3154.50]  Israel is going to be a kingdom again.
[3155.08 --> 3158.42]  You are going to be free and rid of those nations that have surrounded you,
[3158.42 --> 3160.82]  particularly Babylon and Assyria,
[3161.34 --> 3165.74]  who have been slaughtering your people or politically pushing you around.
[3166.40 --> 3168.58]  Finally, Israel is going to be on top.
[3168.92 --> 3172.48]  Your enemies will finally get what they deserve for the evil things they did to you
[3172.48 --> 3174.58]  and to God.
[3175.32 --> 3179.76]  If you are an Israelite, then when you hear about God's justice,
[3179.76 --> 3181.98]  you might be thinking about God's judgment.
[3183.42 --> 3186.04]  And this idea is not a far leap of logic.
[3186.04 --> 3190.18]  In 1 Samuel, chapters 9 to 11,
[3190.64 --> 3193.64]  it details the rise of King Saul,
[3193.76 --> 3195.40]  the first king of Israel,
[3195.52 --> 3197.80]  which takes place hundreds of years
[3197.80 --> 3201.12]  before the prophet Isaiah ever wrote Isaiah.
[3203.82 --> 3207.30]  It tells us how a prophet Samuel is told by God
[3207.30 --> 3209.36]  that a man named Saul will be king.
[3209.92 --> 3211.18]  And as part of being king,
[3211.32 --> 3212.80]  he goes through a series of events
[3212.80 --> 3214.80]  like what happens in Isaiah 42.
[3214.80 --> 3218.48]  And it's one of the passages that would set up the Israelites
[3218.48 --> 3221.44]  for believing in judgment rather than justice
[3221.44 --> 3223.86]  given to all nations.
[3224.50 --> 3226.54]  1 Samuel 9, 15 to 17,
[3226.82 --> 3230.16]  God introduces Saul to Samuel, the prophet.
[3230.34 --> 3231.34]  And this is what we read.
[3232.20 --> 3234.32]  Now, the day before Saul came,
[3234.52 --> 3236.50]  the Lord had revealed this to Samuel.
[3236.50 --> 3238.54]  About this time tomorrow,
[3238.96 --> 3241.46]  I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin.
[3242.28 --> 3244.34]  Anoint him ruler over my people Israel.
[3244.54 --> 3247.02]  He will deliver them from the hand of the Philistines.
[3247.72 --> 3248.90]  I have looked on my people,
[3249.08 --> 3250.58]  for their cry has reached me.
[3251.50 --> 3253.64]  When Samuel caught sight of Saul,
[3253.78 --> 3254.62]  the Lord said to him,
[3254.74 --> 3256.78]  this is the man I spoke to you about.
[3257.24 --> 3258.84]  He will govern my people.
[3258.84 --> 3263.22]  And so the prophet Isaiah is told by God
[3263.22 --> 3266.34]  that he will send someone whom God has chosen,
[3266.62 --> 3267.94]  and this person will bring justice
[3267.94 --> 3269.54]  and save God's people.
[3270.14 --> 3271.76]  And in the case of 1 Samuel,
[3271.90 --> 3273.34]  the prophet Samuel is told
[3273.34 --> 3275.32]  about a person whom God has chosen,
[3275.68 --> 3277.12]  and he will rule God's people.
[3278.48 --> 3279.90]  The next point of similarity
[3279.90 --> 3282.72]  is that the Lord will pour out his spirit
[3282.72 --> 3284.68]  on his servant in Isaiah 42,
[3284.68 --> 3287.14]  and he will bring justice to the nations
[3287.14 --> 3290.14]  in verse 1 of Isaiah 42.
[3290.64 --> 3291.34]  And in two places,
[3291.48 --> 3292.86]  this happens to Saul.
[3293.82 --> 3296.28]  1 Samuel 10, 10 says,
[3296.74 --> 3298.82]  when he and his servant arrived at Gibeah,
[3299.22 --> 3300.64]  a procession of prophets met him,
[3300.78 --> 3303.12]  and the spirit of God came powerfully upon him,
[3303.44 --> 3305.28]  and he joined them in their prophesying.
[3306.86 --> 3309.98]  And later, after Saul had been inaugurated publicly
[3309.98 --> 3313.04]  as king before the prophet in chapter 10,
[3313.04 --> 3315.20]  there is an invasion of Ammonites
[3315.20 --> 3318.56]  who are led by a king named Nachash,
[3318.94 --> 3320.90]  whose name means serpent.
[3321.82 --> 3322.98]  Now, a quick notice.
[3323.40 --> 3324.86]  The name truly does mean serpent,
[3325.30 --> 3327.90]  but I'm going to say snake from now on
[3327.90 --> 3329.20]  for the rest of the sermon,
[3329.44 --> 3332.30]  because I mixed up saying serpent and servant
[3332.30 --> 3334.94]  too many times practicing with Kevin and Chris,
[3335.12 --> 3337.82]  and I accidentally called Jesus the serpent of God,
[3337.88 --> 3339.38]  which is not true.
[3339.38 --> 3343.62]  And so, we will be saying snake today,
[3343.90 --> 3345.92]  but for the note takers, serpent.
[3348.08 --> 3350.06]  And that's going to come important later on.
[3350.86 --> 3351.56]  Back to Saul.
[3352.44 --> 3354.06]  When Saul hears of this evasion
[3354.06 --> 3356.32]  as the now king of Israel,
[3357.84 --> 3360.24]  it states in 1 Samuel 11, 6,
[3360.48 --> 3362.10]  when Saul heard their words,
[3362.34 --> 3364.44]  the spirit of God powerfully came upon him,
[3364.68 --> 3366.26]  and he burned with anger.
[3366.26 --> 3369.26]  Saul then goes on to fight Nachash,
[3370.00 --> 3372.02]  and this is what happens in chapter 11, verse 11.
[3372.74 --> 3374.66]  The next day, Saul separated his men
[3374.66 --> 3375.68]  into three divisions.
[3376.44 --> 3377.80]  During the last watch of the night,
[3377.90 --> 3379.42]  they broke into the camp of the Ammonites
[3379.42 --> 3381.46]  and slaughtered them all
[3381.46 --> 3383.18]  until the heat of the day.
[3383.92 --> 3385.56]  Those who survived were scattered
[3385.56 --> 3387.94]  so that no two of them were left together.
[3390.48 --> 3393.42]  You can see how their expectations could be shaped.
[3393.42 --> 3396.84]  This is a pattern set by the writing of 1 Samuel
[3396.84 --> 3398.96]  that God in the prophecy of Isaiah
[3398.96 --> 3400.68]  is using to tell Israel
[3400.68 --> 3402.90]  about the servant of the Lord
[3402.90 --> 3406.54]  and how he will arrive like the king Saul.
[3407.66 --> 3411.20]  And so, when Israel expects a warrior
[3411.20 --> 3413.54]  who will come and slaughter their oppressors,
[3414.24 --> 3415.58]  first the Babylonians,
[3415.78 --> 3416.94]  when Isaiah is writing this,
[3417.04 --> 3418.02]  and then later the Greeks,
[3418.12 --> 3420.08]  and then the Romans when Jesus arrives,
[3420.08 --> 3425.18]  and do it in the same manner as the Ammonites,
[3425.52 --> 3427.16]  their expectations, though wrong,
[3427.96 --> 3429.30]  are not unfounded.
[3430.64 --> 3432.26]  But with that idea in mind,
[3432.76 --> 3434.86]  the contrasting character of this servant
[3434.86 --> 3437.12]  in comparison with Saul's character,
[3438.12 --> 3440.48]  specifically Saul's character later on in his life,
[3440.52 --> 3441.10]  is shocking.
[3441.94 --> 3443.58]  These two men are nothing alike.
[3444.60 --> 3446.94]  What does Isaiah say about the servant of the Lord?
[3446.94 --> 3450.70]  God's servant will not shout out or cry out.
[3450.98 --> 3452.86]  He will not raise his voice in the streets.
[3453.52 --> 3453.92]  What?
[3455.64 --> 3457.82]  He will not bruise a broken reed
[3457.82 --> 3459.40]  or put out a smoldering wick.
[3459.82 --> 3460.08]  What?
[3460.62 --> 3463.30]  Isaiah means that he's careful to help the downtrodden,
[3463.66 --> 3464.86]  the broken, the weak,
[3465.04 --> 3466.60]  those who are barely holding on,
[3467.22 --> 3468.28]  those with weak faith,
[3468.52 --> 3470.48]  who feel it failing and tested
[3470.48 --> 3472.18]  at every constant struggle.
[3472.18 --> 3475.84]  He will not falter or be discouraged
[3475.84 --> 3479.14]  till he establishes justice on the whole earth.
[3480.26 --> 3482.68]  In faithfulness, he will bring forth justice.
[3483.00 --> 3486.80]  In his teachings, the islands or nations will find hope.
[3487.50 --> 3488.06]  What?
[3488.88 --> 3492.06]  This is nothing like the liar or the tyrant
[3492.06 --> 3495.50]  or the foolish Saul or Israel's expectations.
[3496.42 --> 3497.48]  Where's the war?
[3498.40 --> 3500.36]  Where's the part where God sends this guy
[3500.36 --> 3501.76]  to kill his people's enemies?
[3502.76 --> 3505.36]  Where's the part where this guy brings the wrath of God
[3505.36 --> 3506.62]  to the people I hate?
[3508.00 --> 3509.26]  That hurt me.
[3509.72 --> 3511.50]  Where's the part where God destroys everything
[3511.50 --> 3513.14]  that has made my life hard?
[3514.80 --> 3516.58]  No, not yet.
[3517.08 --> 3517.70]  Not now.
[3519.44 --> 3522.40]  No, this servant of God, this Messiah,
[3522.84 --> 3524.18]  the chosen one of God,
[3524.44 --> 3526.90]  is meek and humble.
[3527.60 --> 3530.20]  He will not shout or cry out or raise his voice.
[3530.20 --> 3533.02]  He is the measure of self-control.
[3533.66 --> 3536.44]  He is a teacher whose words bring hope.
[3537.26 --> 3538.54]  Who when he comes from,
[3538.92 --> 3541.34]  when he comes across the broken or the weakened faith,
[3541.42 --> 3543.74]  he picks them up and breathes life back
[3543.74 --> 3546.64]  into their weak flame and makes them into a fire again.
[3547.60 --> 3549.40]  This man is unable to be discouraged,
[3549.64 --> 3551.26]  unable to fail in weakness.
[3551.26 --> 3554.56]  And in these ways, he will bring justice.
[3555.14 --> 3556.50]  And not just to Israel,
[3557.08 --> 3559.38]  but to every nation,
[3560.18 --> 3561.96]  the whole world even.
[3561.96 --> 3567.24]  God goes on to speak about this servant
[3567.24 --> 3568.84]  in the second section I mentioned earlier.
[3569.46 --> 3570.78]  But first in verse 5,
[3571.02 --> 3573.40]  God describes his own character
[3573.40 --> 3575.76]  and himself giving a foundation
[3575.76 --> 3576.98]  for this servant's mission.
[3577.68 --> 3578.90]  And what God will say in this
[3578.90 --> 3581.06]  to his servant in verses 6 to 9.
[3581.58 --> 3583.40]  God describes himself as the Lord,
[3584.00 --> 3586.24]  the covenant name he gives to Moses,
[3586.74 --> 3588.80]  the name by which Israel calls to be saved
[3588.80 --> 3592.12]  from every calamity and enemy.
[3592.46 --> 3594.98]  The name that their salvation is found in,
[3595.06 --> 3596.26]  the name that is the foundation
[3596.26 --> 3597.94]  of the covenant and the law.
[3598.54 --> 3599.86]  This God describes himself
[3599.86 --> 3601.38]  as the one who created the heavens
[3601.38 --> 3603.10]  and stretches them over the earth
[3603.10 --> 3604.94]  and spreads out the earth
[3604.94 --> 3606.60]  with everything that springs from it.
[3607.68 --> 3609.14]  God is the one who gives breath
[3609.14 --> 3610.58]  to every being and life
[3610.58 --> 3612.08]  to everything that walks.
[3613.14 --> 3615.46]  This description does more than just tell us
[3615.46 --> 3618.12]  how cool or awesome God is.
[3618.12 --> 3620.00]  This passage is telling us
[3620.00 --> 3622.40]  why he is sending this servant
[3622.40 --> 3623.64]  to bring justice,
[3624.00 --> 3625.00]  not just to Israel,
[3625.20 --> 3626.50]  but to all nations.
[3627.18 --> 3628.54]  Because as much as Israel
[3628.54 --> 3630.52]  would not want to hear it at the time,
[3631.88 --> 3633.90]  the Lord, though has chosen Israel,
[3634.20 --> 3636.42]  has a plan for the rest as well.
[3637.60 --> 3639.16]  God's heart is for his people
[3639.16 --> 3640.66]  wherever they are found.
[3641.16 --> 3642.08]  He made them all.
[3643.18 --> 3644.46]  He gives them all breath
[3644.46 --> 3646.26]  and he intends to give them
[3646.26 --> 3648.54]  all justice as well.
[3650.24 --> 3651.98]  And it is the Lord's servant
[3651.98 --> 3653.36]  who will accomplish it.
[3654.36 --> 3656.42]  Look back on verses 6 to 9
[3656.42 --> 3657.16]  in your Bibles
[3657.16 --> 3658.44]  and look what the Lord says
[3658.44 --> 3659.30]  about his servant.
[3659.30 --> 3662.16]  The Lord has called him
[3662.16 --> 3662.90]  in righteousness.
[3663.30 --> 3664.68]  He will take hold of his hand.
[3664.80 --> 3665.64]  He will keep him.
[3665.98 --> 3666.98]  He will make him a covenant
[3666.98 --> 3667.68]  to the people.
[3668.12 --> 3669.14]  He will make him a light
[3669.14 --> 3670.00]  to the Gentiles.
[3670.08 --> 3671.10]  He will open the eyes
[3671.10 --> 3671.80]  of the blind.
[3672.18 --> 3673.66]  He will free the captives
[3673.66 --> 3674.80]  and bring light
[3674.80 --> 3676.26]  to those who are in the dark.
[3679.82 --> 3681.58]  This is what you can expect.
[3683.42 --> 3684.64]  And now we get to read
[3684.64 --> 3686.02]  our other passage today.
[3686.02 --> 3688.88]  Matthew 12, 15 to 21.
[3689.66 --> 3690.84]  So follow along.
[3692.92 --> 3693.88]  Aware of this,
[3694.06 --> 3695.82]  Jesus withdrew from that place.
[3696.50 --> 3698.06]  A large crowd followed him
[3698.06 --> 3699.52]  and he healed all who were ill.
[3700.04 --> 3700.88]  He warned them
[3700.88 --> 3702.62]  not to tell others about him.
[3703.14 --> 3704.12]  This was to fulfill
[3704.12 --> 3704.94]  what was spoken
[3704.94 --> 3706.54]  through the prophet Isaiah.
[3707.26 --> 3708.36]  Here is my servant
[3708.36 --> 3709.28]  whom I have chosen,
[3709.84 --> 3711.16]  the one whom I love,
[3711.84 --> 3713.12]  the one in whom I delight.
[3713.40 --> 3714.90]  I will put my spirit on him
[3714.90 --> 3715.98]  and he will proclaim justice
[3715.98 --> 3716.70]  to the nations.
[3717.56 --> 3718.54]  He will not quarrel
[3718.54 --> 3719.28]  or cry out.
[3719.70 --> 3721.06]  No one will hear his voice
[3721.06 --> 3721.68]  in the streets.
[3722.38 --> 3724.02]  No, a bruised weed,
[3724.22 --> 3725.18]  a bruised reed,
[3725.44 --> 3726.18]  he will not break.
[3726.46 --> 3727.28]  And a smoldering wick,
[3727.74 --> 3728.82]  he will not stuff out.
[3729.06 --> 3730.22]  Till he has brought justice
[3730.22 --> 3731.12]  through to victory.
[3731.50 --> 3732.16]  In his name,
[3732.26 --> 3733.42]  the nations will put their hope.
[3735.48 --> 3736.58]  Matthew quotes
[3736.58 --> 3738.62]  the Isaiah passage from today
[3738.62 --> 3739.70]  as proof
[3739.70 --> 3741.46]  that Jesus is the Messiah.
[3742.34 --> 3743.34]  Matthew is writing here
[3743.34 --> 3745.42]  that Jesus is the servant
[3745.42 --> 3747.30]  spoken of in Isaiah 42.
[3747.94 --> 3748.86]  And he's highlighting
[3748.86 --> 3750.68]  how when Jesus heals the crowd,
[3751.40 --> 3753.98]  he doesn't want them
[3753.98 --> 3754.76]  to tell people.
[3756.24 --> 3756.84]  Why?
[3758.00 --> 3759.56]  Because like the character
[3759.56 --> 3760.98]  of the servant described,
[3761.78 --> 3762.42]  he's humble.
[3763.20 --> 3764.02]  He's meek.
[3764.70 --> 3766.18]  He's not looking to gloat
[3766.18 --> 3768.46]  or present himself as great.
[3769.20 --> 3770.16]  He was quiet,
[3771.04 --> 3771.52]  intentional.
[3772.80 --> 3774.08]  And in keeping them quiet,
[3774.20 --> 3775.26]  Jesus is showing us
[3775.26 --> 3775.94]  and them,
[3776.22 --> 3777.38]  it's not about the fame
[3777.38 --> 3778.34]  or the prestige
[3778.34 --> 3779.72]  or about being lauded
[3779.72 --> 3780.62]  as some hero.
[3781.28 --> 3782.92]  As it says in Philippians 2,
[3783.04 --> 3783.64]  6 to 8,
[3784.34 --> 3786.48]  who being in the very nature God,
[3786.66 --> 3788.46]  did not consider equality with God
[3788.46 --> 3789.86]  something to be used
[3789.86 --> 3791.14]  for his own advantage.
[3791.74 --> 3792.08]  Rather,
[3792.20 --> 3793.16]  he made himself nothing
[3793.16 --> 3794.74]  by taking on the very nature
[3794.74 --> 3796.22]  of a servant.
[3796.22 --> 3799.36]  Being made in human likeness
[3799.36 --> 3800.10]  and being found
[3800.10 --> 3801.20]  in an appearance as a man,
[3801.66 --> 3802.56]  he humbled himself
[3802.56 --> 3804.46]  by becoming obedient to death,
[3804.62 --> 3806.08]  even death on a cross.
[3807.84 --> 3810.32]  Jesus came to be a servant
[3810.32 --> 3812.16]  and not just any servant,
[3812.62 --> 3815.18]  but the servant of the Lord
[3815.18 --> 3816.26]  in Isaiah 42.
[3817.70 --> 3819.44]  And when studying for this passage,
[3819.58 --> 3820.10]  the realization
[3820.10 --> 3822.24]  that just blew me away
[3822.24 --> 3824.50]  was that when Jesus was a child
[3824.50 --> 3826.16]  and learning from the Torah
[3826.16 --> 3827.08]  and the prophets,
[3827.46 --> 3828.14]  as it says,
[3828.22 --> 3829.38]  he learned and grew in wisdom,
[3830.12 --> 3830.90]  that when this,
[3831.12 --> 3832.38]  when he read this passage
[3832.38 --> 3832.92]  in Isaiah,
[3833.60 --> 3834.96]  he knew it was his father
[3834.96 --> 3835.82]  speaking to him.
[3839.56 --> 3840.84]  So that when he goes
[3840.84 --> 3841.44]  to the temple
[3841.44 --> 3842.34]  when he's 12
[3842.34 --> 3843.54]  and when his parents
[3843.54 --> 3844.46]  are looking for him,
[3844.52 --> 3845.54]  he's referring to God
[3845.54 --> 3846.22]  as his father.
[3847.00 --> 3847.84]  And the fact
[3847.84 --> 3849.20]  that it's specifically written
[3849.20 --> 3850.08]  as God speaking
[3850.08 --> 3851.12]  to his servant
[3851.12 --> 3852.72]  just makes that
[3852.72 --> 3853.96]  so much more powerful.
[3855.84 --> 3856.72]  Jesus knew
[3856.72 --> 3857.50]  that this is why
[3857.50 --> 3858.06]  he was here,
[3858.30 --> 3859.22]  why he was born.
[3860.54 --> 3862.32]  But knowing he was God,
[3862.68 --> 3863.14]  did not,
[3863.44 --> 3864.52]  he did not consider
[3864.52 --> 3865.06]  that something
[3865.06 --> 3866.30]  to be taken advantage of.
[3866.80 --> 3867.20]  Instead,
[3867.36 --> 3869.46]  he lived a humble life,
[3870.00 --> 3871.12]  just like the servant
[3871.12 --> 3872.10]  is described to.
[3875.34 --> 3876.86]  And so when Jesus grew up
[3876.86 --> 3877.84]  and eventually went
[3877.84 --> 3878.64]  to the Jordan River
[3878.64 --> 3879.32]  to be baptized,
[3879.32 --> 3881.30]  we see again
[3881.30 --> 3883.22]  a similar series of events
[3883.22 --> 3885.28]  as Saul's rise to king.
[3886.20 --> 3887.06]  And we start
[3887.06 --> 3888.14]  to see connections
[3888.14 --> 3888.86]  between the passage
[3888.86 --> 3890.18]  Kevin preached last Sunday
[3890.18 --> 3891.78]  in chapter 3 of Matthew.
[3892.82 --> 3894.78]  We read in verses 2 to 3,
[3895.32 --> 3895.90]  in those days,
[3896.02 --> 3896.96]  John the Baptist came
[3896.96 --> 3897.84]  preaching in the wilderness
[3897.84 --> 3898.44]  of Judea
[3898.44 --> 3898.84]  and said,
[3898.98 --> 3899.88]  repent for the kingdom
[3899.88 --> 3901.38]  of heaven has come near.
[3902.16 --> 3903.56]  This is who was spoken of
[3903.56 --> 3904.48]  through the prophet Isaiah,
[3904.68 --> 3905.78]  a voice of the one
[3905.78 --> 3906.72]  calling through the wilderness.
[3907.34 --> 3907.82]  Prepare the way
[3907.82 --> 3908.26]  for the Lord,
[3908.36 --> 3909.30]  make straight paths
[3909.30 --> 3909.72]  for him.
[3911.16 --> 3911.92]  Matthew quotes
[3911.92 --> 3912.76]  from Isaiah 40,
[3912.86 --> 3913.52]  the same passage
[3913.52 --> 3915.32]  Kevin preached last Sunday
[3915.32 --> 3915.98]  about the hope
[3915.98 --> 3916.80]  we have in God.
[3917.62 --> 3918.24]  John the Baptist
[3918.24 --> 3919.74]  then tells the Pharisees
[3919.74 --> 3920.54]  and the Sadducees
[3920.54 --> 3921.60]  that one is coming
[3921.60 --> 3923.12]  who will baptize
[3923.12 --> 3923.86]  with the Holy Spirit
[3923.86 --> 3924.32]  and fire
[3924.32 --> 3926.04]  and who with his winnowing fork
[3926.04 --> 3927.10]  will separate the wheat
[3927.10 --> 3927.94]  and the chaff.
[3928.56 --> 3929.48]  John is telling them
[3929.48 --> 3930.54]  that this man
[3930.54 --> 3931.76]  will come to judge.
[3933.08 --> 3934.32]  Jesus then arrives
[3934.32 --> 3935.00]  on the Jordan River
[3935.00 --> 3936.74]  and goes to John the Baptist.
[3936.74 --> 3938.24]  John the Baptist
[3938.24 --> 3939.62]  doesn't want to baptize Jesus
[3939.62 --> 3940.44]  because he doesn't see
[3940.44 --> 3941.20]  himself as worthy.
[3941.46 --> 3941.78]  Instead,
[3942.06 --> 3943.50]  Jesus should be baptizing him.
[3945.04 --> 3945.68]  Jesus tells him
[3945.68 --> 3946.30]  he has to.
[3947.08 --> 3947.52]  And when Jesus
[3947.52 --> 3949.88]  rises out of the water,
[3950.58 --> 3951.28]  the Holy Spirit
[3951.28 --> 3952.56]  descends on him
[3952.56 --> 3953.32]  as a dove
[3953.32 --> 3954.96]  and God says,
[3955.34 --> 3956.46]  this is my son
[3956.46 --> 3957.68]  in whom I love.
[3958.02 --> 3958.58]  With him,
[3958.68 --> 3959.66]  I am well pleased.
[3959.66 --> 3959.78]  Jesus.
[3961.34 --> 3962.32]  This declaration
[3962.32 --> 3963.14]  from God
[3963.14 --> 3964.74]  is very similar
[3964.74 --> 3965.84]  to verses 1 and 2
[3965.84 --> 3966.86]  of Isaiah 42.
[3968.32 --> 3969.18]  And so what we see
[3969.18 --> 3970.48]  in this series of events
[3970.48 --> 3972.26]  in 1 Samuel,
[3972.50 --> 3973.06]  in Isaiah,
[3973.22 --> 3974.42]  and the Gospel of Matthew,
[3974.74 --> 3976.70]  they all share similarities
[3976.70 --> 3978.68]  about a chosen one of God
[3978.68 --> 3980.06]  either being a king
[3980.06 --> 3980.74]  or a servant
[3980.74 --> 3981.58]  and in this case,
[3981.76 --> 3982.04]  Jesus.
[3983.40 --> 3984.62]  The first connection
[3984.62 --> 3986.04]  is that in all three stories
[3986.04 --> 3986.90]  there is a prophet
[3986.90 --> 3988.30]  who receives word
[3988.30 --> 3990.12]  that a man God has chosen
[3990.12 --> 3991.28]  is going to arrive
[3991.28 --> 3993.02]  and that he is going
[3993.02 --> 3994.10]  to lead God's people
[3994.10 --> 3995.26]  and bring justice
[3995.26 --> 3996.44]  or judgment.
[3997.36 --> 3997.84]  Second,
[3998.10 --> 3999.22]  in all three stories,
[3999.36 --> 4000.72]  this man has the Holy Spirit
[4000.72 --> 4001.70]  poured out on him
[4001.70 --> 4003.80]  as a visible sign
[4003.80 --> 4005.02]  that this is God's man
[4005.02 --> 4005.88]  and that he's empowered
[4005.88 --> 4006.82]  to do the task.
[4007.90 --> 4008.42]  And third,
[4008.52 --> 4009.42]  in all stories,
[4009.52 --> 4010.26]  there is a declaration
[4010.26 --> 4011.00]  from God
[4011.00 --> 4012.68]  that this man,
[4013.28 --> 4015.02]  that this man was sent.
[4015.54 --> 4016.30]  This is the one
[4016.30 --> 4017.20]  who I promised.
[4017.20 --> 4019.66]  And the last point
[4019.66 --> 4020.10]  of connection
[4020.10 --> 4022.02]  of which I find
[4022.02 --> 4023.02]  utterly surprising
[4023.02 --> 4024.36]  is that Jesus,
[4024.82 --> 4025.56]  is what Jesus does
[4025.56 --> 4027.44]  after this public declaration,
[4027.66 --> 4029.16]  after he's baptized,
[4030.16 --> 4032.30]  is he goes into the wilderness
[4032.30 --> 4034.02]  and he fights a snake.
[4035.72 --> 4037.08]  Led by the Holy Spirit,
[4037.18 --> 4037.76]  like Saul,
[4037.86 --> 4038.46]  who was empowered
[4038.46 --> 4039.14]  by the Spirit,
[4039.82 --> 4040.86]  he goes and faces
[4040.86 --> 4041.76]  the temptations
[4041.76 --> 4042.46]  of the devil.
[4043.34 --> 4044.16]  And like Saul,
[4044.28 --> 4044.94]  who attacked
[4044.94 --> 4046.24]  with three divisions
[4046.24 --> 4046.82]  of his army,
[4047.10 --> 4048.22]  Jesus defends himself
[4048.22 --> 4049.50]  with the word
[4049.50 --> 4050.60]  three times
[4050.60 --> 4051.30]  from attacks
[4051.30 --> 4052.16]  from the snake
[4052.16 --> 4053.38]  who was the one
[4053.38 --> 4054.06]  in the garden
[4054.06 --> 4056.10]  who deceived Adam and Eve
[4056.10 --> 4057.58]  who started this whole mess.
[4059.46 --> 4060.44]  Just like Saul,
[4060.54 --> 4061.42]  after being declared
[4061.42 --> 4062.58]  by God
[4062.58 --> 4063.96]  to be his chosen one,
[4064.14 --> 4065.54]  he goes and fights
[4065.54 --> 4066.50]  God's enemy
[4066.50 --> 4068.74]  and the enemy
[4068.74 --> 4069.70]  of God's people
[4069.70 --> 4071.22]  and is victorious,
[4072.18 --> 4073.04]  proving himself
[4073.04 --> 4074.00]  to be the king
[4074.00 --> 4074.48]  of Israel.
[4077.36 --> 4078.38]  But let us go back
[4078.38 --> 4078.92]  to how God
[4078.92 --> 4080.66]  introduces his servant,
[4081.02 --> 4081.22]  Jesus,
[4081.50 --> 4082.32]  in Matthew 3.
[4083.54 --> 4084.80]  God has declared
[4084.80 --> 4085.30]  that Jesus
[4085.30 --> 4086.38]  is his servant,
[4086.86 --> 4087.46]  this man
[4087.46 --> 4088.50]  in whom he loves.
[4088.98 --> 4089.58]  But we get
[4089.58 --> 4090.78]  one more piece
[4090.78 --> 4091.40]  of information.
[4092.54 --> 4093.26]  God's servant
[4093.26 --> 4094.74]  is his son.
[4095.66 --> 4097.00]  The son of God
[4097.00 --> 4098.30]  is the servant
[4098.30 --> 4099.14]  who will bring justice
[4099.14 --> 4099.82]  to the nations.
[4099.82 --> 4101.42]  The son of God
[4101.42 --> 4102.20]  is the servant
[4102.20 --> 4103.44]  who will be the light
[4103.44 --> 4104.22]  to the world.
[4104.80 --> 4105.64]  The son of God
[4105.64 --> 4106.14]  is the one
[4106.14 --> 4106.76]  who gives sight
[4106.76 --> 4107.30]  to the blind
[4107.30 --> 4108.64]  and frees the captives.
[4109.28 --> 4111.22]  The servant of God
[4111.22 --> 4113.06]  is God.
[4114.34 --> 4115.54]  The same God
[4115.54 --> 4116.52]  who in verse 5
[4116.52 --> 4117.48]  of Isaiah 42
[4117.48 --> 4118.60]  is the one
[4118.60 --> 4119.58]  who made the heavens
[4119.58 --> 4120.48]  and stretched them
[4120.48 --> 4121.10]  over the earth.
[4121.46 --> 4122.48]  The one who gives life
[4122.48 --> 4123.32]  to every man
[4123.32 --> 4124.00]  and breath
[4124.00 --> 4125.52]  to everything that walks.
[4125.94 --> 4127.38]  The Lord God
[4127.38 --> 4128.98]  of all the earth
[4128.98 --> 4131.60]  is the very same
[4131.60 --> 4132.64]  humble,
[4133.10 --> 4133.42]  meek,
[4133.94 --> 4134.46]  quiet,
[4135.12 --> 4135.94]  self-controlled,
[4136.74 --> 4138.12]  not crying out,
[4138.56 --> 4140.14]  careful for the bruised reed
[4140.14 --> 4141.22]  and smoldering wick.
[4141.78 --> 4142.44]  That God
[4142.44 --> 4143.62]  is a servant
[4143.62 --> 4144.24]  at heart.
[4145.34 --> 4146.34]  Jesus himself
[4146.34 --> 4146.84]  declares
[4146.84 --> 4147.78]  in Matthew 11
[4147.78 --> 4150.04]  that he is meek
[4150.04 --> 4150.92]  and lowly
[4150.92 --> 4151.58]  at heart.
[4153.20 --> 4154.10]  A servant
[4154.10 --> 4155.22]  who did not consider
[4155.22 --> 4156.48]  equality with God
[4156.48 --> 4157.34]  worth advantage,
[4157.34 --> 4159.96]  but rather humbled himself
[4159.96 --> 4160.80]  to be obedient
[4160.80 --> 4161.66]  to death,
[4161.78 --> 4162.86]  even death on a cross.
[4163.32 --> 4164.56]  Who lived the life
[4164.56 --> 4165.38]  we should have lived,
[4165.46 --> 4166.46]  who died the death
[4166.46 --> 4167.76]  we should have died.
[4168.00 --> 4169.16]  The phrase we have said
[4169.16 --> 4170.30]  for every sermon
[4170.30 --> 4171.38]  for years
[4171.38 --> 4172.80]  is the justice
[4172.80 --> 4173.84]  and judgment
[4173.84 --> 4174.84]  of God
[4174.84 --> 4176.24]  given to all nations
[4176.24 --> 4176.94]  brought there
[4176.94 --> 4178.84]  by God's servant.
[4178.84 --> 4178.96]  judgment.
[4181.46 --> 4182.58]  But there's more.
[4183.14 --> 4184.34]  We still have to get
[4184.34 --> 4185.86]  to the big idea.
[4186.84 --> 4187.76]  The love God has
[4187.76 --> 4188.54]  for his son
[4188.54 --> 4189.66]  is the love God
[4189.66 --> 4190.76]  has for you.
[4191.62 --> 4192.20]  Romans 8,
[4192.38 --> 4193.46]  14 to 17
[4193.46 --> 4194.12]  gives us
[4194.12 --> 4195.24]  that final piece
[4195.24 --> 4195.70]  of the puzzle
[4195.70 --> 4196.66]  that locks all this
[4196.66 --> 4197.16]  in place
[4197.16 --> 4198.20]  and helps us
[4198.20 --> 4199.42]  understand Isaiah 42.
[4200.46 --> 4201.70]  For those who are led
[4201.70 --> 4202.64]  by the spirit of God
[4202.64 --> 4204.64]  are children of God.
[4204.84 --> 4206.46]  The spirit you received
[4206.46 --> 4208.06]  does not make you slaves,
[4208.06 --> 4209.28]  so that you live
[4209.28 --> 4209.98]  in fear again.
[4210.18 --> 4210.48]  Rather,
[4210.98 --> 4212.28]  the spirit you received
[4212.28 --> 4213.84]  brought about your adoption
[4213.84 --> 4214.84]  to sonship
[4214.84 --> 4216.72]  and by him we cry
[4216.72 --> 4217.40]  Abba Father.
[4217.98 --> 4219.04]  The spirit himself
[4219.04 --> 4220.32]  testifies with our spirit
[4220.32 --> 4221.62]  that we are God's children.
[4222.32 --> 4223.28]  Now if we are children
[4223.28 --> 4224.18]  then we are heirs,
[4224.34 --> 4225.02]  heirs of God
[4225.02 --> 4226.30]  and co-heirs with Christ.
[4226.76 --> 4227.90]  If indeed we share
[4227.90 --> 4228.82]  in his sufferings
[4228.82 --> 4229.90]  in order that we may
[4229.90 --> 4231.24]  also share in his glory.
[4232.20 --> 4233.44]  Paul in Romans 8
[4233.44 --> 4234.74]  is telling us
[4234.74 --> 4235.86]  that those with the spirit
[4235.86 --> 4237.60]  are adopted into sonship.
[4238.06 --> 4239.12]  under the father
[4239.12 --> 4240.14]  and that we become
[4240.14 --> 4241.34]  more like Christ.
[4241.72 --> 4242.28]  Meaning,
[4242.54 --> 4243.48]  that since the servant
[4243.48 --> 4244.20]  is Christ
[4244.20 --> 4244.84]  and the character
[4244.84 --> 4245.34]  of the servant
[4245.34 --> 4246.70]  is listed in Isaiah
[4246.70 --> 4247.92]  is the character
[4247.92 --> 4248.72]  of Christ
[4248.72 --> 4250.24]  that we will become
[4250.24 --> 4251.14]  more like that.
[4253.00 --> 4254.36]  We will put aside
[4254.36 --> 4255.40]  our evil ways
[4255.40 --> 4256.66]  and become meek
[4256.66 --> 4257.50]  and lowly
[4257.50 --> 4258.82]  and desire to bring
[4258.82 --> 4260.18]  justice to all nations.
[4261.02 --> 4262.30]  And not only that,
[4262.88 --> 4264.30]  what Romans is telling us
[4264.30 --> 4265.76]  is that we as Christians
[4265.76 --> 4267.16]  who have been baptized,
[4267.82 --> 4269.06]  have been given the spirit,
[4269.36 --> 4271.34]  gain the same relationship
[4271.34 --> 4272.74]  with the father
[4272.74 --> 4273.74]  as Jesus has.
[4274.52 --> 4275.86]  We become co-heirs
[4275.86 --> 4276.38]  with Christ
[4276.38 --> 4276.98]  to the father.
[4277.46 --> 4278.26]  That means that
[4278.26 --> 4279.22]  in Isaiah 42
[4279.22 --> 4280.72]  when God is speaking
[4280.72 --> 4281.62]  to his servant
[4281.62 --> 4282.42]  directly,
[4282.98 --> 4284.34]  he's speaking to you
[4284.34 --> 4288.28]  and me
[4288.28 --> 4289.76]  through Christ.
[4289.76 --> 4291.52]  we as sons of God
[4291.52 --> 4292.50]  are not the same
[4292.50 --> 4294.10]  as the one true
[4294.10 --> 4294.88]  son of God,
[4295.42 --> 4296.60]  but through unity
[4296.60 --> 4297.36]  with Christ,
[4298.24 --> 4299.60]  with the Holy Spirit,
[4300.98 --> 4305.56]  we have the same love
[4305.56 --> 4306.54]  that the father
[4306.54 --> 4307.48]  has for the son
[4307.48 --> 4309.90]  the father has for us.
[4309.90 --> 4314.16]  all those promises
[4314.16 --> 4317.40]  given from the father
[4317.40 --> 4318.44]  to his son,
[4318.52 --> 4319.14]  that servant,
[4319.46 --> 4320.48]  are given to you,
[4321.04 --> 4322.84]  which also means
[4322.84 --> 4324.00]  he has sent you
[4324.00 --> 4326.06]  on the same mission
[4326.06 --> 4327.88]  that God has called you
[4327.88 --> 4328.66]  out of righteousness
[4328.66 --> 4329.68]  to bring justice
[4329.68 --> 4330.68]  to all nations,
[4331.52 --> 4333.50]  to live as Christ did
[4333.50 --> 4335.30]  and to die if necessary.
[4336.18 --> 4337.56]  And not that your death
[4337.56 --> 4338.84]  will be a death like his,
[4338.84 --> 4340.10]  but that your death
[4340.10 --> 4340.86]  is your sharing
[4340.86 --> 4342.00]  in his suffering
[4342.00 --> 4343.34]  and that you may also
[4343.34 --> 4344.46]  share in his glory.
[4345.28 --> 4346.80]  That same love
[4346.80 --> 4347.66]  that the father
[4347.66 --> 4348.48]  has for the son,
[4348.84 --> 4350.44]  he has for you.
[4350.86 --> 4351.86]  And the same love
[4351.86 --> 4352.86]  that God has for you,
[4353.02 --> 4354.38]  he also has for everyone
[4354.38 --> 4355.32]  in this church.
[4356.78 --> 4357.60]  And because the church
[4357.60 --> 4358.64]  is the body of Christ,
[4358.94 --> 4360.00]  you get to have
[4360.00 --> 4362.22]  what every other person
[4362.22 --> 4363.10]  in this church has
[4363.10 --> 4364.44]  and everyone in this church
[4364.44 --> 4365.04]  loves you
[4365.04 --> 4366.28]  the way you love them.
[4367.30 --> 4368.72]  It's the same love
[4368.72 --> 4370.04]  the same love
[4370.04 --> 4370.54]  that the Trinity
[4370.54 --> 4371.58]  has had for eternity
[4371.58 --> 4373.92]  and will have for eternity.
[4374.16 --> 4375.44]  That same perfect,
[4375.80 --> 4376.82]  self-sacrificing,
[4377.02 --> 4377.72]  ever-giving,
[4378.08 --> 4379.14]  never-ending love
[4379.14 --> 4380.68]  is the very same love
[4380.68 --> 4381.80]  that courses through
[4381.80 --> 4382.52]  this church.
[4384.28 --> 4385.72]  That same love
[4385.72 --> 4387.54]  in all those verses
[4387.54 --> 4388.30]  that we opened up
[4388.30 --> 4389.10]  this sermon with
[4389.10 --> 4390.74]  is the very same love
[4390.74 --> 4391.30]  that the father
[4391.30 --> 4392.16]  has for the son
[4392.16 --> 4394.02]  and the father
[4394.02 --> 4395.28]  has for you.
[4395.28 --> 4398.00]  So when we as the church,
[4398.32 --> 4399.64]  as co-heirs of Christ,
[4400.40 --> 4402.36]  sons of the Lord God,
[4403.16 --> 4404.78]  go out into the world,
[4405.62 --> 4406.50]  let us not go out
[4406.50 --> 4407.56]  holding on to being
[4407.56 --> 4408.32]  sons of God
[4408.32 --> 4408.72]  as something
[4408.72 --> 4409.80]  to take advantage of,
[4410.22 --> 4411.08]  but rather live
[4411.08 --> 4411.60]  as servants
[4411.60 --> 4412.78]  of the Lord God,
[4413.32 --> 4414.36]  bringing justice
[4414.36 --> 4415.54]  to the whole world
[4415.54 --> 4417.18]  like Christ.
[4417.84 --> 4418.74]  And like Christ,
[4418.94 --> 4420.14]  who was humbly willing
[4420.14 --> 4420.60]  to die
[4420.60 --> 4421.32]  because of the love
[4421.32 --> 4421.96]  of his father
[4421.96 --> 4422.86]  and the love
[4422.86 --> 4423.52]  for his people,
[4423.90 --> 4424.68]  let us go out
[4424.68 --> 4426.40]  and love as he loves.
[4427.92 --> 4428.32]  Amen.
[4429.76 --> 4430.46]  Let us pray.
[4434.90 --> 4435.30]  Father,
[4436.02 --> 4437.64]  thank you for this day.
[4437.90 --> 4439.02]  Thank you for this church.
[4439.74 --> 4440.66]  Thank you, Lord,
[4440.74 --> 4441.86]  for the same love
[4441.86 --> 4443.92]  that you have loved us with,
[4443.96 --> 4445.44]  that you loved your son with.
[4446.42 --> 4447.14]  I pray, Lord,
[4447.22 --> 4447.98]  that as we go out
[4447.98 --> 4448.62]  from this place,
[4448.72 --> 4449.64]  that we as your church,
[4449.68 --> 4450.32]  as your body,
[4450.80 --> 4451.94]  can love as Christ did.
[4452.52 --> 4453.38]  And that your spirit
[4453.38 --> 4454.74]  will pour on us
[4454.74 --> 4456.74]  and empower us to do so.
[4457.94 --> 4459.14]  The spirit came upon us
[4459.14 --> 4460.06]  at our baptisms, Lord,
[4460.16 --> 4461.64]  and just like Christ,
[4461.80 --> 4462.86]  we get to go out
[4462.86 --> 4463.72]  and do your work
[4463.72 --> 4464.70]  and serve you.
[4465.24 --> 4465.86]  And I pray, Lord,
[4465.90 --> 4466.78]  that we would do so
[4466.78 --> 4468.80]  with joy and humility
[4468.80 --> 4470.24]  and meekness.
[4471.08 --> 4471.32]  Amen.
[4471.32 --> 4471.42]  Amen.
[4478.02 --> 4479.28]  I invite you to rise
[4479.28 --> 4479.92]  as we sing.
[4481.96 --> 4485.90]  You may try to quote you
[4485.90 --> 4503.50]  Over the skies of Bethlehem were cleared as dark
[4503.50 --> 4509.90]  While angels sang to lowly shepherds
[4509.90 --> 4517.90]  Three wise men seeking truth traveled from afar
[4517.90 --> 4523.90]  Hoping to find the child of heaven
[4523.90 --> 4527.90]  Falling on at ease
[4527.90 --> 4535.90]  They bowed before the humble Prince of Peace
[4535.90 --> 4542.90]  Might bring an offering of worship to our King
[4542.90 --> 4549.90]  No one on earth deserves the praises that we sing
[4549.90 --> 4557.90]  Jesus, do you receive the honor that you're due
[4557.90 --> 4564.90]  Call the Lord, I bring an offering to you
[4564.90 --> 4575.90]  The sun cannot compare to the glory of your love
[4575.90 --> 4582.90]  There is no shadow in your presence
[4582.90 --> 4590.90]  No mortal man can dare to stand before your throne
[4590.90 --> 4596.90]  Before the Holy One of Heaven
[4596.90 --> 4599.90]  And it's only by your blood
[4599.90 --> 4603.90]  And it's only through your mercy
[4603.90 --> 4607.90]  Lord, I come
[4607.90 --> 4613.90]  I bring an offering of worship to my King
[4613.90 --> 4620.90]  No one on earth deserves the praises that we sing
[4620.90 --> 4628.90]  Jesus, do you receive the honor that you're due
[4628.90 --> 4629.90]  Oh, Lord, I bring an offering to you
[4629.90 --> 4635.90]  Oh, Lord, I bring an offering to you
[4635.90 --> 4639.90]  I bring an offering of worship to my King
[4639.90 --> 4645.90]  No one on earth deserves the praises that we sing
[4645.90 --> 4649.90]  Jesus, may you receive the honor that you're due
[4649.90 --> 4656.90]  Jesus, may you receive the honor that you're due
[4656.90 --> 4663.90]  Oh, Lord, I bring an offering to you
[4663.90 --> 4670.90]  Oh, Lord, I bring an offering to you
[4670.90 --> 4682.90]  The Lord's blessing
[4682.90 --> 4684.90]  The Lord bless you and keep you
[4684.90 --> 4687.90]  The Lord make his face shine on you and be gracious to you
[4687.90 --> 4691.90]  The Lord turn his face towards you and give you peace
[4691.90 --> 4693.90]  Amen
[4700.90 --> 4724.90]  Angels we have heard on high
[4724.90 --> 4728.90]  Sweetly singing o'er the plains
[4728.90 --> 4732.90]  And the mountains in reply
[4732.90 --> 4736.90]  Echoing their joyous dreams
[4736.90 --> 4740.90]  Gloria
[4740.90 --> 4744.90]  In excelsis Deo

[4758.90 --> 4760.90]  Shepherds, why this jubilee
[4760.90 --> 4764.90]  Why your joyous strains prolong
[4764.90 --> 4766.90]  What glad gladsome tidings be
[4766.90 --> 4768.90]  Which inspire your heavenly song
[4768.90 --> 4769.90]  Gloria
[4769.90 --> 4770.90]  In excelsis Deo

[4775.90 --> 4776.90]  Why your joyous strains prolong
[4776.90 --> 4778.90]  To the psalmist, why this jubilee
[4778.90 --> 4780.90]  Why your joyous winds come along

[4813.10 --> 4816.50]  Let whose birth the angels sing.
[4816.50 --> 4820.40]  Come adore on plent of thee.
[4820.56 --> 4824.26]  Christ the Lord, the newborn King.
