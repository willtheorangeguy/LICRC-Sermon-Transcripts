[0.00 → 29.98] Thank you.
[30.00 → 59.98] Thank you.
[60.00 → 89.98] Thank you.
[90.00 → 119.98] Thank you.
[120.00 → 122.00] Thank you.
[150.00 → 152.00] Thank you.
[180.00 → 182.00] Thank you.
[210.00 → 212.00] Thank you.
[240.00 → 242.00] Thank you.
[242.00 → 244.00] Thank you.
[244.00 → 246.00] Thank you.
[274.00 → 276.00] Thank you.
[304.64 → 306.00] Thank you.
[306.00 → 308.00] Thank you.
[308.00 → 316.00] Holy, holy is the Lord.
[316.00 → 323.00] Holy, holy is the Lord.
[323.00 → 329.00] Holy, holy is the Lord.
[338.00 → 345.00] Good morning.
[345.00 → 348.00] Good morning.
[348.00 → 352.00] I realize everyone's kind of making their way in yet, and that's great.
[352.00 → 356.00] I want to just take a moment and welcome you to worship here at Emanuel Church.
[356.00 → 361.00] My name is Chris. I'm one of the pastors here at Emanuel.
[361.00 → 366.00] And this week, actually, this is the last time you'll see me for the rest of the service.
[366.00 → 368.00] Well, I'll be sitting over there, so if you look there, I'll be there.
[368.00 → 373.00] But we have the privilege this morning of welcoming Jonathan Wang to the pulpit.
[373.00 → 381.00] He is one of the pastors at Hope Community Church, a sister Christian reform church out in Clayton Heights.
[381.00 → 387.00] And so we're really privileged to have Jonathan here with us this morning and leading us.
[387.00 → 390.00] Before we begin our worship together, we've got a bunch of announcements.
[390.00 → 394.00] And so I'm going to invite Leanne and Brandon to make their way up here
[394.00 → 397.00] because they're going to have announcements for us.
[397.00 → 403.00] And as they're making their way up here, let me say one announcement.
[403.00 → 408.00] This is from my mother, so I'm going to read it to make sure I get it right.
[408.00 → 415.00] So this week, before the craft and bake sale, where 35 vendors are going to be selling their products
[415.00 → 420.00] and raising funds for the Mexico mission trip, the refugee fund, and some kitchen updates,
[420.00 → 425.00] in order to make that day successful, which is on this coming Saturday, they need some help.
[425.00 → 429.00] And that's going to be helping with setup and takedown.
[429.00 → 436.00] And so on Wednesday night at 7 p.m., they need a team to take the chairs out of the sanctuary.
[436.00 → 441.00] And on Saturday at 5.30 p.m., we need a team to put the chairs back.
[441.00 → 444.00] I'm going to keep doing this.
[444.00 → 450.00] If you're available for either of those dates or to clean up generally at 4.30 on Saturday,
[450.00 → 452.00] that would be greatly appreciated.
[452.00 → 456.00] If you're able to help out, please contact Rob Alchemy, who's not here this morning.
[456.00 → 460.00] But if you need to know details of that, you can just grab me after service.
[460.00 → 465.00] We are excited to open our doors to the community, and we invite all of you to spread the word
[465.00 → 467.00] and to be part of this day.
[467.00 → 474.00] We hope to see you here on Saturday at the Community Christmas Craft and Bake Sale.
[474.00 → 477.00] I think that's the official title.
[477.00 → 482.00] And then we're also looking to add some baking to a church table.
[482.00 → 486.00] And so if you're able to do some baking or provide something in that regard,
[486.00 → 492.00] please connect with Miriam De Winter or Pastor Kevin, and they'll figure that out together.
[492.00 → 494.00] I think that's it.
[494.00 → 495.00] Mom is online.
[495.00 → 497.00] She can text me if I missed something.
[497.00 → 499.00] Leanne, why don't we go to you?
[499.00 → 502.00] So I'm making an announcement for the Women's Ministry.
[502.00 → 507.00] We're going to be doing our Women's Christmas event, November 29th, here at the church.
[507.00 → 512.00] The sign-up sheets are linked in the midweek memo, but you can also see myself,
[512.00 → 517.00] and I'm not sure which other member of the committee, but we'll be at the back table to help if you need sign-up,
[517.00 → 519.00] just with a good old-fashioned pen and paper.
[519.00 → 523.00] There are two sign-up sheets, one to attend, and please bring your friends and your neighbours with you.
[523.00 → 527.00] And there's also a sign-up sheet if you'd like to decorate a table.
[527.00 → 531.00] Food is really important at these events, so we do ask that you bring a hot food,
[531.00 → 534.00] dish or dessert to share with the group.
[534.00 → 537.00] And men, we don't want you to feel left out entirely from the ladies' event.
[537.00 → 542.00] So there's also a sign-up at the back if you'd like to come at the end of the evening to help us reset the sanctuary.
[542.00 → 546.00] There may or may not be food left over for you, depending on the ladies.
[546.00 → 548.00] Thanks.
[548.00 → 555.00] All right, so we got an announcement for...
[555.00 → 559.00] She wanted to say it, but...
[559.00 → 562.00] Mexico, this will be the final announcement for sign-up.
[562.00 → 564.00] Sign-up is going to be due today.
[564.00 → 568.00] We have paper copies back there, electronic copies online.
[568.00 → 571.00] We also have an update in terms of trip dates.
[571.00 → 574.00] God opened some doors and kind of made the decision for us.
[574.00 → 580.00] So the trip dates will be March 15 to the 24th, 25th, depending on flight prices.
[580.00 → 583.00] We will be staying at Connections for the entire time now.
[583.00 → 586.00] Another youth pastor's mistake opened the doors for us.
[586.00 → 588.00] So thankfully for that.
[588.00 → 590.00] Unfortunate for that church, I guess.
[590.00 → 593.00] But we do have a place to stay now, so those will be the dates.
[593.00 → 597.00] We are going to also just have a meeting directly after the service.
[597.00 → 600.00] Let's say like 50 minutes after the service ends or noon or whatever.
[600.00 → 601.00] Just in the multimedia room.
[601.00 → 604.00] Just, I would like to get numbers of who's coming on the trip.
[604.00 → 606.00] I need that finalized today because I've got to book vans.
[606.00 → 608.00] And I've got to book some other stuff.
[608.00 → 611.00] So even if you have not filled out the form like you were supposed to...
[611.00 → 613.00] Oh, good morning.
[613.00 → 615.00] Just call you out.
[615.00 → 617.00] Come to that meeting.
[617.00 → 620.00] That way I can get those finalized numbers and figure that out.
[620.00 → 623.00] That's adults, youth, anybody who's coming.
[623.00 → 625.00] Parents, if you want to come just to hear about it too.
[625.00 → 627.00] We'll just do like a five, ten-minute meeting.
[627.00 → 630.00] Go over the schedule for the rest of the year and what we're kind of doing.
[630.00 → 631.00] So yeah.
[631.00 → 633.00] Thank you very much.
[638.00 → 640.00] Okay.
[640.00 → 644.00] Also, I want to make this announcement.
[644.00 → 645.00] And this one's from my wife.
[645.00 → 648.00] So I'm also going to read it to make sure that I get it correct.
[648.00 → 655.00] The Safe Ministries team has added a third night for training on Wednesday, November 19.
[655.00 → 665.00] And so if you haven't completed the Safe Ministries training, the abuse recognition and prevention training, you will hear from Rachel in this coming week to confirm your attendance.
[665.00 → 672.00] Please note that this training is required for anyone working with vulnerable populations or children under 19.
[672.00 → 676.00] So this includes worship team members and ushers.
[676.00 → 683.00] Council members, we will receive a special and separate training sometime in the bearish future.
[683.00 → 695.00] And for Safe Ministries team, if you have completed the forms that were handed out to you, please don't forget to return those to the mailbox out by the church office there.
[695.00 → 704.00] Lastly, after worship this morning is Youth Coffee being hosted at John and Fran Skipper's house.
[704.00 → 705.00] John and Fran, hands up.
[705.00 → 709.00] If you have questions on how to get there, you can talk to them or any of the youth leaders have the address.
[709.00 → 711.00] They can get you there.
[711.00 → 714.00] I think that's all the announcements.
[714.00 → 716.00] Ken, am I wrong?
[716.00 → 718.00] You're all-knowing.
[718.00 → 722.00] That was an inside joke.
[722.00 → 723.00] Sorry, that was unfair.
[723.00 → 729.00] Let's stand up together as we are welcomed by God into worship this morning.
[729.00 → 739.00] I'm going to extend to you God's greeting, and then I invite you to turn to those around you and continue extending that greeting by saying,
[739.00 → 744.00] May the peace of Christ be with you or the Lord be with you in our worship together.
[744.00 → 746.00] Receive the greeting of our God.
[746.00 → 757.00] Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, Son, and our Saviour, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[757.00 → 758.00] Amen.
[769.00 → 771.00] Please join us for today'migration.
[771.00 → 773.00] Good to see you again.
[773.00 → 774.00] We'reerecting.

[801.18 → 804.34] through our call to worship from 1 Peter 1, verse 3.
[804.96 → 808.26] Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[808.78 → 811.42] In his great mercy, he has given us new birth
[811.42 → 813.50] into a living hope through the resurrection
[813.50 → 815.34] of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[825.00 → 827.00] Amen.
[835.00 → 844.38] Come, people of the risen King, who delight to bring Him praise.
[844.66 → 853.00] Come all into your hearts to sing to the morning star of grace.
[853.00 → 862.00] From the shifting shadows of the earth, we will lift our eyes to Him.
[863.36 → 871.00] Where steady arms of mercy reach to never children in.
[873.24 → 881.00] Rejoice, rejoice, let every tongue rejoice.
[881.00 → 886.28] One heart, one voice.
[886.56 → 890.00] O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[890.00 → 906.00] Come on those who destroy His morning sun and those weeping through the night.
[906.00 → 916.16] Come on those who tell of battles won and O Roll in the fight.
[916.16 → 921.28] For His perfect love will never change.
[921.72 → 925.16] And His mercies never cease.
[925.16 → 930.72] But follow us through all our days.
[930.72 → 934.16] The surge in hope of He.
[934.16 → 943.72] Rejoice, rejoice, let every tongue rejoice.
[943.72 → 948.72] One heart, one voice.
[949.28 → 952.72] O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[952.72 → 973.72] O Church of Christ, O Church of poor, let every tongue see the blood will grow.
[973.72 → 979.20] Empty hands find the riches of His grace.
[979.20 → 984.12] Over all the world His people see,
[984.40 → 988.44] Shore to shore we hear them call.
[988.84 → 993.56] The truth that rhymes through every inch,
[993.72 → 997.64] Our God is all in all.
[999.28 → 1002.48] Rejoice, rejoice,
[1002.48 → 1006.48] Let every tongue rejoice,
[1007.48 → 1011.60] One heart, one voice,
[1012.08 → 1015.58] O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[1017.32 → 1020.74] Rejoice, rejoice,
[1021.22 → 1024.48] Let every tongue rejoice,
[1025.80 → 1029.48] One heart, one voice,

[1052.70 → 1079.62] O God, you are my God, and I will ever praise you.

[1089.94 → 1099.76] I will seek you in the morning, and I will learn to walk in your ways.
[1099.76 → 1108.76] And step by step you'll lead me, and I will follow you all of my days.

[1180.60 → 1182.18] What is God's first?
[1182.60 → 1185.40] Some days it may have been even hard to tell that I'm a Christian.
[1185.40 → 1190.60] O God, you will hear me today.
[1190.60 → 1193.54] because he wants you to be assured by his spirit.
[1194.48 → 1195.28] Hear this truth.
[1196.04 → 1198.88] You are no longer a slave, but God's child.
[1199.28 → 1202.22] And since you are his child, God has made you his heir.

[1259.96 → 1264.60] A deliverance from my enemies.
[1266.00 → 1270.54] Till all my fears are gone.

[1368.98 → 1374.98] I am a child of God.
[1384.98 → 1395.98] Swift the sea so I could walk right through it. My fears were drowned in perfect love.
[1395.98 → 1406.98] You rescued me so I could stand and sing. I am a child of God.
[1407.98 → 1418.98] You split the sea so I could walk right through it. My fears were drowned in perfect love.
[1418.98 → 1430.98] You rescued me so I could stand and sing. I am a child of God. I am a child of God.

[1469.98 → 1481.98] I am a child of God. I am a child of God.
[1481.98 → 1504.04] For the days that God has numbered, I was made to walk with Him.
[1504.04 → 1513.04] Yet I look for worldly treasure, and forsake the King of kings.
[1513.38 → 1522.00] But my new soul is my Redeemer, though I'm warm, His love is sure.
[1522.52 → 1530.92] For Christ has made for every failing, I am His forevermore.
[1534.04 → 1536.04] Amen.
[1564.04 → 1594.04] 
[1594.04 → 1624.04] 
[1624.04 → 1632.76] Namaste, I pray that I have learned from His Η scholar in Thine's 1860s.

[1850.30 → 1855.30] And I will trust in you alone.
[1856.30 → 1861.30] And I will trust in you alone.
[1861.30 → 1868.30] For your endless mercy follows me.
[1868.30 → 1873.30] Your goodness will lead me home.
[1873.30 → 1888.30] And though I walk the darkest path, I will not fear the evil one.
[1888.30 → 1900.30] For you are with me and your rod and staff are the comfort I need to know.
[1900.30 → 1905.30] And I will trust in you alone.
[1905.30 → 1911.30] And I will trust in you alone.
[1911.30 → 1918.30] For your endless mercy follows me.
[1918.30 → 1923.30] Your goodness will lead me home.
[1923.30 → 1929.30] And I will trust in you alone.
[1929.30 → 1935.30] And I will trust in you alone.
[1935.30 → 1942.30] For your endless mercy follows me.
[1942.30 → 1947.30] Your goodness will lead me home.
[1947.30 → 1968.30] And I will trust in you alone.
[1968.30 → 1969.30] Good morning.
[1969.30 → 1970.30] My name is Yap.
[1970.30 → 1972.30] I am a deacon here at Langley Emanuel.
[1972.30 → 1977.30] This morning's offering will be for Wellspring BCO Chaplain.
[1977.30 → 1979.30] Please give as you are able to.
[1979.30 → 1980.30] Thank you.
[1980.30 → 1981.30] Thank you.
[1981.30 → 1982.30] Thank you.
[1982.30 → 1987.30] Thank you.
[1987.30 → 1992.30] Thank you.
[1992.30 → 1997.30] Thank you.
[1997.30 → 2002.30] Thank you.
[2002.30 → 2004.30] Thank you.
[2004.30 → 2027.30] And to my вас standing left c's and three bodies once again.
[2027.30 → 2030.30] And to my new creation.
[2030.30 → 2038.54] My life now yielded to my King
[2038.54 → 2043.04] My will to Him surrender
[2043.04 → 2049.80] I'm broken open at Your feet
[2049.80 → 2054.32] Your presence is a treasure
[2054.32 → 2059.92] It's You alone I treasure
[2059.92 → 2068.92] Holy, worthy
[2068.92 → 2075.92] You have no end
[2076.46 → 2081.92] Holy, worthy
[2081.92 → 2088.92] Please sing Amen
[2088.92 → 2090.92] Amen
[2090.92 → 2098.92] Let every knee on earth can flow
[2098.92 → 2104.92] And join the host of heaven
[2104.92 → 2110.92] To Him who sits upon the throne
[2110.92 → 2115.92] Give praise and adoration
[2115.92 → 2121.92] The days of hell are overgrown
[2121.92 → 2126.92] The yoke of slavery shatter
[2126.92 → 2132.92] For Christ our King He reigns alone
[2132.92 → 2137.92] Now and forever after
[2137.92 → 2143.92] Now and forever after
[2143.92 → 2151.92] Holy, worthy
[2151.92 → 2158.92] You have no end
[2158.92 → 2164.92] Holy, worthy
[2164.92 → 2170.92] We sing Amen
[2170.92 → 2171.92] Amen
[2171.92 → 2177.92] Holy, worthy
[2177.92 → 2182.92] You have no end
[2182.92 → 2183.92] Holy, worthy
[2183.92 → 2198.92] We sing Amen
[2198.92 → 2200.92] Amen
[2200.92 → 2209.92] The centre of all history
[2209.92 → 2215.92] Your cross and resurrection
[2215.92 → 2234.92] Good morning everybody
[2234.92 → 2243.92] Good morning everybody
[2243.92 → 2245.92] It looks like a lot of the kids have come up
[2245.92 → 2247.92] But if there's anybody else who would like to come up
[2247.92 → 2249.92] From preschool to grade four
[2249.92 → 2251.92] Come on up
[2251.92 → 2258.92] Okay this morning
[2258.92 → 2264.92] What have we been studying the last number of weeks in children's worship time?
[2264.92 → 2265.92] Just shout it out
[2265.92 → 2266.92] Joseph
[2266.92 → 2269.92] Can you guys tell me some of the characteristics?
[2269.92 → 2272.92] This is going to be like a little quiz almost
[2272.92 → 2274.92] What is one of the weeks that we studied?
[2274.92 → 2275.92] What we studied?
[2285.92 → 2289.92] Yep, Joseph getting his rainbow coat and his brothers took it from him
[2289.92 → 2290.92] Yep
[2296.92 → 2299.92] Yep, Joseph interpreting the dreams
[2299.92 → 2301.92] Yep, anybody else?
[2301.92 → 2306.92] Mm-hmm
[2306.92 → 2311.92] So we talked about Joseph's two dreams
[2311.92 → 2315.92] When he gives us a dream we will see through
[2315.92 → 2319.92] And then we also talked about his jacket taken away
[2319.92 → 2321.92] And another time we talked about Joseph
[2321.92 → 2324.92] I know last week we talked about him being in prison
[2324.92 → 2327.92] So basically we have been going through Joseph's life
[2327.92 → 2331.92] And I found on when I was looking stuff up
[2331.92 → 2333.92] I found on the internet
[2333.92 → 2335.92] Where it says
[2335.92 → 2338.92] Talking about Joseph's like an apple
[2338.92 → 2341.92] So with an apple think about what we do with an apple
[2341.92 → 2343.92] With an apple we drop apples
[2343.92 → 2345.92] We peel apples
[2345.92 → 2346.92] We kick apples
[2346.92 → 2347.92] Just a second Mateo
[2347.92 → 2349.92] And we cut them into pieces
[2349.92 → 2352.92] So when Joseph looks back on his life
[2352.92 → 2354.92] He sees God through everything
[2354.92 → 2356.92] Because all those things
[2356.92 → 2357.92] Where you drop it
[2357.92 → 2358.92] You get a bruise
[2358.92 → 2359.92] You peel it
[2359.92 → 2360.92] There could be a bruise
[2360.92 → 2362.92] Or the peels aren't so good
[2362.92 → 2363.92] When you kick it
[2363.92 → 2364.92] You can feel hurt
[2364.92 → 2366.92] And then you cut it into pieces
[2366.92 → 2367.92] To put it in a pie
[2367.92 → 2369.92] Well through all of that
[2369.92 → 2370.92] Eventually
[2370.92 → 2372.92] Joseph sees God
[2372.92 → 2373.92] Used in all this way
[2373.92 → 2375.92] When we make applesauce
[2375.92 → 2378.92] Because we put everything into applesauce
[2378.92 → 2381.92] And he puts every part of us
[2381.92 → 2383.92] God is with us
[2383.92 → 2384.92] Protecting us
[2384.92 → 2386.92] So today what we're going to learn about
[2386.92 → 2387.92] Is we're going to learn about
[2387.92 → 2389.92] Joseph the ruler
[2389.92 → 2393.92] As he is the ruler of Egypt
[2393.92 → 2395.92] And our big idea today is
[2395.92 → 2397.92] God helps us forgive those who have hurt us
[2397.92 → 2399.92] So think about that
[2399.92 → 2400.92] Because I'm going to ask you a question
[2400.92 → 2401.92] In children's worship time
[2401.92 → 2403.92] On how we feel
[2403.92 → 2405.92] When someone has hurt us
[2405.92 → 2407.92] Or we have an argument
[2407.92 → 2408.92] Okay
[2408.92 → 2409.92] Can everybody stand up?
[2409.92 → 2414.92] And look at the congregation
[2414.92 → 2415.92] Or your parents
[2415.92 → 2417.92] Okay
[2417.92 → 2419.92] One, two, three
[2419.92 → 2420.92] Here we go
[2420.92 → 2422.92] The Lord be with us
[2422.92 → 2424.92] Also with you
[2437.92 → 2438.92] To join us
[2438.92 → 2439.92] Our church family
[2439.92 → 2449.92] Thank you
[2449.92 → 2451.92] Hi, my name's Paul, and I'm an elder here
[2451.92 → 2466.92] And I'd invite you to join me as I pray for this church family
[2466.92 → 2481.22] Gracious Heavenly Father, you are our sovereign God who created all things for your pleasure
[2481.22 → 2485.86] and who gives us all life and breath and every good thing.
[2485.86 → 2491.30] Thank you for the world you created in which we live, Lord.
[2491.98 → 2495.08] We have the privilege to live in this beautiful place.
[2495.08 → 2501.92] We only have to look around us to see your handiwork.
[2501.92 → 2508.76] We give thanks for all of this world in its immense beauty beyond our knowing.
[2508.76 → 2516.78] You know it and you know us and you make yourself known through the creation we see around us.
[2516.78 → 2522.18] We thank you for the abundance of the gifts you give us.
[2522.18 → 2527.82] We thank you for the sun and the rains that allow the land to flourish.
[2527.82 → 2534.86] Your blessings are poured out on each one of us regardless of what we do and how we live our lives.
[2534.86 → 2543.54] We thank you also in times of disappointments and failures that lead us to acknowledge our dependence on you alone.
[2543.54 → 2551.88] We especially thank you for your saving grace that you've shown us through your son, Jesus Christ.
[2551.88 → 2560.58] Open our hearts so that we allow your spirit to lead us so that we may walk in your ways.
[2560.58 → 2566.92] With your spirit, help us to pray because we don't know how to pray as we should.
[2568.04 → 2573.60] We ask that you intercede for us with sighs too deep for words.
[2573.60 → 2582.54] Father, we give you thanks for bringing us together as a church.
[2582.54 → 2588.28] We pray that you will bless us in our worship, bless us in our fellowship.
[2588.28 → 2594.76] We give you thanks for this place to meet that has been provided for us.
[2594.76 → 2603.86] We thank you, O God, for Christ's church as we know it and see it throughout the world and pray for your blessings on it.
[2604.92 → 2610.12] We ask that you would be with those that are persecuted for your namesake.
[2612.34 → 2617.10] Thank you for your mercy and grace, for always being there when we need you.
[2617.10 → 2623.88] When the days are long and our troubles heavy, you are there to walk beside us.
[2625.18 → 2631.78] We've all come with individual and personal needs, needs that may not have been shared with anyone else.
[2632.84 → 2636.38] But you know us and the struggles and the burdens we're facing.
[2639.58 → 2645.24] We're grateful that Judy Verse's surgery went well and that she is able to go home.
[2645.24 → 2650.44] We pray for patience and continued healing for Judy.
[2653.00 → 2660.68] We praise you, God, for the quick healing of Louise's face after her Bell's palsy diagnosis.
[2662.68 → 2666.64] We continue to pray for Ashley as she is continuing chemo treatment.
[2667.64 → 2672.32] We pray for Ashley, her husband, and her kids as they navigate this journey.
[2672.32 → 2675.82] We ask for strength and complete healing.
[2678.66 → 2683.40] We remember the shut-ins and those that cannot physically join us each Sunday.
[2684.12 → 2689.62] We pray that they can feel God's presence in their lives and the sense of community from a distance.
[2692.00 → 2695.72] We pray for all our leaders, both locally and around the world.
[2695.72 → 2700.74] We pray that above all, they will be guided by your spirit.
[2701.88 → 2706.76] We pray that your hand be present in the ongoing conflicts around the world.
[2709.40 → 2714.30] We pray that through all the special events that are happening at Emmanuel over the next few weeks,
[2714.44 → 2719.28] that our church family can be Christ's light to all those who attend.
[2719.28 → 2723.50] And that we will fill all the volunteer spots needed.
[2724.54 → 2729.38] We pray you will continue to bless all the ongoing ministries of this church.
[2731.88 → 2735.92] As we hear your will for us this morning,
[2736.66 → 2739.14] through the word preached by Pastor Jonathan,
[2740.62 → 2742.44] bind us together in Christ.
[2742.44 → 2745.94] Keep us focused on your purpose.
[2746.68 → 2748.46] And fill us with the Holy Spirit.
[2749.78 → 2752.98] We pray that we will grow in love and truth,
[2754.12 → 2755.90] righteousness and peace,
[2756.34 → 2757.64] hope and faith.
[2758.92 → 2760.50] Help us to grow in Jesus,
[2760.70 → 2763.64] that we may become more and more like him,
[2763.88 → 2765.86] in character and soul.
[2767.54 → 2770.60] Fulfill your will and purposes among us,
[2770.60 → 2772.12] so that we can go out.
[2773.62 → 2776.18] Your kingdom will advance through us,
[2776.34 → 2778.92] and your holy name is glorified.
[2781.26 → 2785.64] Who are we that we would share in your love and tender care,
[2785.90 → 2788.06] raised to an exalted height,
[2788.72 → 2791.48] and crowned with honour in your sight?
[2792.28 → 2794.84] How great is your name.
[2794.84 → 2798.36] We pray that you will come quickly, Lord,
[2798.46 → 2801.28] and bring our redemption to completeness.
[2802.66 → 2805.56] We pray all these things in your holy name.
[2806.26 → 2806.62] Amen.
[2806.62 → 2806.72] Amen.
[2820.72 → 2822.34] Good morning.
[2822.34 → 2826.06] I think you can hear me.
[2826.36 → 2826.64] Yes?
[2828.76 → 2832.54] It is a gift and a privilege to worship with you again,
[2832.74 → 2834.08] and to bring you God's word.
[2835.02 → 2837.56] And as Elder Paul just prayed for us,
[2838.02 → 2842.38] for us to be Christ's light for the world is our calling,
[2842.98 → 2844.72] our baptismal identity,
[2844.86 → 2845.42] the salvation,
[2845.74 → 2847.76] the gift that we receive from Christ,
[2848.30 → 2851.08] is so that we reflect it for the world,
[2851.08 → 2853.12] to be a blessing for the world.
[2853.28 → 2855.98] That's what it means to be disciples of Christ.
[2856.16 → 2856.44] Yes?
[2856.90 → 2859.90] And we are all called to be disciples of Christ,
[2860.12 → 2863.04] which means that we are called to walk step by step
[2863.04 → 2865.84] with our Saviour every day of our lives,
[2865.88 → 2867.22] not just on Sunday mornings.
[2867.56 → 2868.82] As a gift as it is,
[2869.08 → 2872.34] it is to be here together as brothers and sisters in Christ,
[2872.74 → 2876.22] we are also sent to be a light for the world.
[2876.22 → 2878.76] And as I was preparing for today,
[2878.90 → 2881.50] and what I wanted to share with Emmanuel here,
[2882.06 → 2885.76] was maybe a focus on what it means to be a light,
[2886.00 → 2887.34] yes, to be disciples,
[2887.84 → 2889.60] but especially in our workplaces.
[2890.66 → 2894.48] And what more appropriate image is there
[2894.48 → 2896.68] for to be a blessing in a workplace
[2896.68 → 2899.90] than to take on a work equipment,
[2900.80 → 2903.02] the yoke of Christ, Jesus says.
[2903.02 → 2904.88] Because when you think of it,
[2905.38 → 2906.56] you could ask,
[2906.68 → 2909.12] why did Jesus use a yoke image
[2909.12 → 2913.48] to teach us what it means to be his followers?
[2914.20 → 2916.16] And so that's what we want to look at,
[2916.38 → 2918.44] to take on Jesus' yoke,
[2919.10 → 2921.58] which is light, and his burden is easy.
[2922.80 → 2924.38] Does it always feel that way?
[2924.78 → 2925.66] Not to sure,
[2925.78 → 2928.84] but that's the wrestling that we get to do together
[2928.84 → 2929.80] with God's word.
[2929.80 → 2931.62] This is good news for us.
[2931.70 → 2933.02] And I want to invite you
[2933.02 → 2937.00] to receive Jesus' yoke as good news.
[2937.20 → 2938.84] Not as an extra burden,
[2939.04 → 2941.56] oh, it means that we have to do this as Christians,
[2941.68 → 2942.56] we have to do that.
[2942.92 → 2948.64] No, it is to be truly rested in Christ's presence.
[2948.88 → 2950.46] That's what it means to take on his yoke.
[2950.68 → 2952.20] And that is good news for us.
[2952.48 → 2953.66] So with that in mind,
[2953.90 → 2955.60] I would like for us to see
[2955.60 → 2957.66] what an actual yoke looks like.
[2957.66 → 2959.50] If we can see it on the screen,
[2959.64 → 2960.22] there we go.
[2960.58 → 2962.78] So, I mean, if you're not familiar with it,
[2962.88 → 2964.58] obviously I didn't grow up on a farm,
[2964.74 → 2967.20] and so I had to remind myself what a yoke is.
[2967.58 → 2968.78] This will come up again.
[2968.90 → 2971.30] So I invite you to keep this image in your head,
[2971.94 → 2974.06] just this image of a yoke.
[2974.14 → 2976.14] This is what a stereotypical yoke looks like.
[2976.78 → 2979.58] And so when you think about work,
[2980.04 → 2981.24] you know, in your workplaces
[2981.24 → 2984.20] or whatever you think of when you think of work,
[2985.48 → 2987.76] when you actually do the hard work,
[2987.88 → 2989.90] the right way to do something,
[2989.96 → 2991.06] instead of taking shortcuts,
[2991.84 → 2993.70] can you try to think of the times
[2993.70 → 2995.92] when it was so fulfilling to do that hard work?
[2996.68 → 2996.84] Right?
[2996.92 → 2998.32] Not taking shortcuts, right?
[2998.36 → 3000.68] Doing the actual hard work of doing it the right way,
[3000.94 → 3003.68] and how fulfilling it was afterwards.
[3004.52 → 3004.76] You know?
[3005.46 → 3007.12] I know this doesn't really count as work
[3007.12 → 3010.10] because it's not necessarily what I do as a vocation,
[3010.48 → 3011.66] but I grew up as a drummer.
[3012.30 → 3013.64] I've drummed my whole,
[3013.90 → 3015.04] I can't say whole life,
[3015.16 → 3016.96] I've drummed more than half of my life,
[3016.98 → 3017.48] I'll just say.
[3018.02 → 3019.84] I've served on worship teams,
[3020.10 → 3021.66] from my memory,
[3021.84 → 3023.28] almost ever since I was youth,
[3023.52 → 3025.52] I've never stopped until maybe adulthood.
[3026.24 → 3026.78] But anyway,
[3027.34 → 3029.36] when I recall the countless hours
[3029.36 → 3030.98] that I tormented my family,
[3031.14 → 3033.82] playing and practicing the drums in my home,
[3033.82 → 3036.28] that's when I think of doing it the right way,
[3036.38 → 3037.34] like doing hard work.
[3037.90 → 3038.98] Like if you know the movie,
[3039.54 → 3041.66] like think of me like that guy in Whiplash,
[3042.06 → 3042.28] right?
[3042.34 → 3043.94] Where he's just working on his craft,
[3044.10 → 3045.48] like he's getting sweaty and bloody,
[3045.88 → 3046.84] like in his hands I mean,
[3047.14 → 3048.52] and he's just trying to work
[3048.52 → 3050.70] so that he can hone his craft.
[3051.40 → 3052.90] Now I didn't go to that extreme,
[3053.00 → 3053.38] and again,
[3053.46 → 3054.58] I'm not a professional drummer,
[3054.98 → 3056.92] but instead of taking shortcuts
[3056.92 → 3058.92] and just spinning sticks and showing off,
[3059.12 → 3060.58] I did the hard work
[3060.58 → 3062.74] and it was freeing and rewarding
[3062.74 → 3065.36] when playing with the rest of the worship band.
[3066.40 → 3068.10] And I think this is the sort of image
[3068.10 → 3070.12] of what our passage that we're going to look at
[3070.12 → 3071.26] is trying to teach us,
[3071.54 → 3073.22] what Jesus is trying to teach us.
[3073.32 → 3077.12] Because Jesus offers us the way to true rest,
[3077.88 → 3079.52] which is true life,
[3079.64 → 3081.94] to flourish and to live the way
[3081.94 → 3084.56] God intended for us from the beginning.
[3084.98 → 3087.26] It is hard work in some ways,
[3087.26 → 3089.80] but it's the right way to live.
[3090.06 → 3092.04] And Jesus offers the flourishing,
[3092.26 → 3094.98] freeing gift of real life.
[3095.98 → 3097.42] And I think that's the tough part
[3097.42 → 3098.22] of the passage today.
[3098.74 → 3099.96] It is hard work,
[3100.30 → 3101.40] doing the right thing,
[3101.48 → 3102.44] not taking shortcuts,
[3102.64 → 3104.38] living with Jesus in the way of blessing.
[3104.64 → 3106.70] It may not always feel easy
[3106.70 → 3108.64] and light all the time,
[3109.12 → 3110.66] especially, I suggest,
[3110.72 → 3111.60] in our workplaces.
[3112.22 → 3114.42] But this hard work is made easy
[3114.42 → 3117.70] because it is the Lord of creation
[3117.70 → 3119.16] who comforts,
[3119.52 → 3120.42] and more importantly,
[3120.70 → 3123.84] who equips us for this right way of living.
[3124.82 → 3126.48] And so if you have your Bibles with you,
[3126.90 → 3129.46] or if you can take a look on the screen,
[3129.86 → 3131.10] we read from God's Word
[3131.10 → 3132.56] from the Gospel of Matthew.
[3133.54 → 3136.00] In chapter 11, we read from verse 25.
[3136.00 → 3139.64] At that time, Jesus said,
[3139.64 → 3141.06] I praise you, Father,
[3141.18 → 3142.80] Lord of heaven and earth,
[3142.92 → 3145.04] because you have hidden these things
[3145.04 → 3146.16] from the wise and learned
[3146.16 → 3148.28] and revealed them to little children.
[3149.08 → 3149.70] Yes, Father,
[3149.84 → 3151.96] for this is what you were pleased to do.
[3152.48 → 3154.80] All things have been committed to me
[3154.80 → 3155.94] by my Father.
[3156.32 → 3158.68] No one knows the Son except the Father,
[3158.76 → 3161.30] and no one knows the Father except the Son,
[3161.38 → 3164.28] and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him.
[3164.84 → 3166.18] So come to me,
[3166.36 → 3168.54] all you who are weary and burdened,
[3168.54 → 3170.24] and I will give you rest.
[3171.20 → 3173.96] Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,
[3174.06 → 3176.68] for I am gentle and humble in heart,
[3176.80 → 3179.50] and you will find rest for your souls.
[3180.40 → 3181.32] For my yoke,
[3181.92 → 3184.94] my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
[3185.48 → 3186.80] This is the Word of the Lord.
[3188.84 → 3191.12] And so upon my reading and reflecting,
[3191.92 → 3193.44] I thought of four questions
[3193.44 → 3194.94] that helped me think a little deeper
[3194.94 → 3196.26] about the passage
[3196.26 → 3198.04] and about Jesus' tough teaching here.
[3198.54 → 3199.68] So these four questions
[3199.68 → 3201.18] will be up on the screen for you.
[3201.42 → 3202.00] First,
[3202.34 → 3203.96] who is Jesus talking about
[3203.96 → 3205.74] when He says the wise and learned?
[3205.86 → 3206.22] He says,
[3206.60 → 3208.42] you have kept these things
[3208.42 → 3209.84] from the wise and learned.
[3210.52 → 3211.14] Wise and learned,
[3211.22 → 3211.70] who are they?
[3212.12 → 3212.44] Second,
[3212.68 → 3213.98] who are the little children then?
[3214.20 → 3214.68] He says,
[3215.00 → 3216.32] the Father kept these things
[3216.32 → 3217.62] from the wise and learned,
[3217.70 → 3219.76] but revealed them to little children.
[3220.10 → 3221.46] So who are the little children?
[3221.98 → 3222.30] Third,
[3222.30 → 3224.06] who is Jesus claiming to be
[3224.06 → 3224.84] in this passage?
[3225.34 → 3226.44] Because I suggest
[3226.44 → 3228.50] it was a very scandalous message,
[3228.90 → 3230.64] especially to those Jews,
[3230.94 → 3231.80] first century Jews,
[3231.92 → 3233.48] receiving this message from Him.
[3234.26 → 3235.02] And then lastly,
[3235.62 → 3237.06] why or how
[3237.06 → 3238.86] is wearing Jesus' yoke
[3238.86 → 3240.24] easy for our lives?
[3240.36 → 3240.70] Again,
[3240.98 → 3241.74] what I suggested,
[3241.86 → 3242.78] this is good news.
[3243.10 → 3245.00] This is good news for us.
[3245.68 → 3246.66] And so these questions
[3246.66 → 3248.00] sort of outline our whole passage.
[3248.00 → 3249.04] So let's tackle
[3249.04 → 3250.04] the first two questions.
[3250.62 → 3251.00] For that,
[3251.12 → 3251.76] we need to look at
[3251.76 → 3252.84] the actual context.
[3253.34 → 3255.54] Because in the immediate context
[3255.54 → 3257.66] of Jesus speaking these words,
[3258.28 → 3259.64] the verses right before it,
[3260.12 → 3261.54] Jesus is speaking judgment
[3261.54 → 3263.78] against the unrepentant cities
[3263.78 → 3265.28] and towns that He ministered in.
[3265.70 → 3266.98] So He goes and shares
[3266.98 → 3268.04] the good news of the kingdom,
[3268.20 → 3269.40] but these cities and towns
[3269.40 → 3270.32] do not receive them.
[3271.16 → 3272.46] And then from that,
[3272.60 → 3273.98] after calling judgment
[3273.98 → 3275.12] and woes on those
[3275.12 → 3276.00] unrepentant cities,
[3276.68 → 3277.94] Jesus right away
[3277.94 → 3279.60] turns and then praises
[3279.60 → 3280.28] the Father.
[3281.22 → 3282.38] It's a bit of a weird image
[3282.38 → 3283.34] if you think about it.
[3284.28 → 3285.22] Because right after,
[3286.16 → 3287.38] again, like I said,
[3287.54 → 3289.46] right after speaking judgment,
[3289.66 → 3291.00] He praises the Father.
[3291.16 → 3291.92] And you can ask,
[3292.62 → 3293.44] and technically,
[3293.60 → 3295.04] you can ask Jesus and say,
[3295.40 → 3295.66] Jesus,
[3296.08 → 3297.42] I thought you were
[3297.42 → 3300.20] like bringing God's kingdom
[3300.20 → 3300.86] on earth
[3300.86 → 3302.12] and that your miracles
[3302.12 → 3303.14] and your ministries
[3303.14 → 3304.74] would convince everyone
[3304.74 → 3305.86] to become your disciples.
[3305.86 → 3308.46] How come they did not repent
[3308.46 → 3309.98] and they did not follow you?
[3311.38 → 3312.44] Isn't that a failure?
[3313.50 → 3314.88] But now you're turning to God
[3314.88 → 3315.82] and you're praising Him?
[3316.62 → 3317.20] For what?
[3317.92 → 3318.16] Right?
[3319.24 → 3320.84] Well, Jesus gives thanks,
[3321.10 → 3321.78] and specifically,
[3322.02 → 3322.66] He gives thanks
[3322.66 → 3323.66] and praises the Father
[3323.66 → 3325.44] for not revealing the kingdom
[3325.44 → 3327.56] to the wise and learned.
[3327.80 → 3329.02] Hence, our first question.
[3329.58 → 3331.08] Who are the wise and learned?
[3331.08 → 3334.52] Jesus can't simply be talking about
[3334.52 → 3335.80] like smart people, can He?
[3336.36 → 3337.16] Like the scholars
[3337.16 → 3337.94] and those people
[3337.94 → 3338.90] who thought they were smart?
[3339.46 → 3341.56] Wouldn't that be a problem
[3341.56 → 3342.70] for us today as well?
[3343.20 → 3344.60] If God just hates
[3344.60 → 3345.80] or God does not reveal
[3345.80 → 3347.12] His kingdom to smart people,
[3347.58 → 3348.24] I mean, who thinks
[3348.24 → 3348.92] they're smart here?
[3349.56 → 3350.46] If you raise your hand,
[3350.52 → 3352.10] then the kingdom is not yours.
[3353.10 → 3355.22] It can't be as simple as that, can it?
[3356.84 → 3358.10] Obviously, that's not
[3358.10 → 3359.22] what Jesus is getting at.
[3359.22 → 3361.34] What Jesus is speaking into,
[3361.48 → 3362.56] it's a common theme
[3362.56 → 3363.46] that's found throughout
[3363.46 → 3364.84] the whole biblical story.
[3365.54 → 3366.90] See, Jesus is giving thanks
[3366.90 → 3368.62] to the Father for His love
[3368.62 → 3370.56] for the lowly and oppressed.
[3371.54 → 3371.72] Right?
[3372.14 → 3373.76] That's what Jesus is talking about.
[3373.86 → 3374.52] Throughout the Bible,
[3374.60 → 3376.42] we can see that our God,
[3376.68 → 3377.82] our Father in Heaven,
[3378.24 → 3379.60] loves and has mercy
[3379.60 → 3380.82] on those that are vulnerable
[3380.82 → 3381.88] and are in need.
[3382.26 → 3384.52] Just to pull out a couple of verses
[3384.52 → 3385.42] from the Old Testament,
[3385.80 → 3387.50] in Isaiah 66, we read,
[3387.50 → 3389.24] Has not my hand made
[3389.24 → 3390.04] all these things,
[3390.12 → 3391.54] and so they come into being,
[3392.08 → 3392.90] declares the Lord.
[3393.30 → 3394.36] These are the ones
[3394.36 → 3395.80] I look on with favour.
[3396.42 → 3397.56] Those who are humble
[3397.56 → 3399.00] and contrite in spirit
[3399.00 → 3401.04] and who tremble at my word.
[3401.82 → 3403.26] The humble and the lowly.
[3403.62 → 3405.24] Even Proverbs 3, it says,
[3405.66 → 3406.26] He mocks.
[3406.32 → 3408.42] So God mocks proud mockers,
[3408.54 → 3409.90] but shows favour
[3409.90 → 3411.66] to the humble and oppressed.
[3412.78 → 3414.22] That's the Father's heart.
[3414.22 → 3415.98] And that's what Jesus is reflecting
[3415.98 → 3417.42] as well as He teaches us.
[3418.14 → 3419.82] So this theme of humbling the proud
[3419.82 → 3421.16] and exalting the humble
[3421.16 → 3423.58] can be found in books like Job
[3423.58 → 3425.18] and Proverbs as we saw,
[3425.52 → 3426.22] in the prophet Ezekiel
[3426.84 → 3428.04] or in the Gospel of Matthew
[3428.04 → 3428.78] or even Luke.
[3429.16 → 3429.68] And arguably,
[3430.04 → 3431.42] it's traced all throughout
[3431.42 → 3432.76] in both Testaments.
[3434.08 → 3435.08] So it's safe to say
[3435.08 → 3437.28] that Jesus is not simply saying
[3437.28 → 3438.44] that the Father hates
[3438.44 → 3439.22] and hides the kingdom
[3439.22 → 3440.16] from smart people.
[3440.60 → 3441.64] He is saying that
[3441.64 → 3443.72] our God opposes the proud.
[3444.22 → 3447.20] In other words,
[3447.36 → 3449.22] Jesus is speaking against those
[3449.22 → 3450.42] who have the temptation
[3450.42 → 3451.22] to think either,
[3451.30 → 3452.04] on the one hand,
[3452.44 → 3455.16] that we can overcome anything
[3455.16 → 3457.10] by our own wisdom and strength,
[3457.52 → 3459.32] where we sit on God's throne
[3459.32 → 3461.18] and we try to rule our own lives.
[3461.68 → 3462.62] That sort of pride.
[3463.22 → 3464.54] Or, on the other hand,
[3464.84 → 3465.82] those who think
[3465.82 → 3466.92] that more knowledge
[3466.92 → 3469.30] and close work with God's word
[3469.30 → 3472.20] must make us especially privileged
[3472.20 → 3473.62] and closer to God,
[3473.98 → 3476.64] as if there are holy vocations
[3476.64 → 3479.28] versus secular jobs.
[3481.34 → 3482.80] And speaking of that,
[3482.94 → 3484.58] it's a sad reality in history
[3484.58 → 3485.96] and part of our Christianity,
[3486.16 → 3486.54] isn't it?
[3487.58 → 3487.84] Right?
[3487.94 → 3489.68] Whether intentionally or not,
[3489.92 → 3491.50] many Christians throughout history
[3491.50 → 3493.22] have so commonly set up
[3493.22 → 3494.42] hierarchies of jobs,
[3494.54 → 3496.38] thinking that only if you work
[3496.38 → 3497.06] for the church
[3497.06 → 3498.30] or a mission organization,
[3498.30 → 3499.72] you are holier
[3499.72 → 3501.14] or you are better Christian.
[3502.50 → 3503.88] And that's what Jesus
[3503.88 → 3505.10] is speaking against here
[3505.10 → 3506.12] in this passage as well,
[3506.42 → 3508.00] against those religious elites,
[3508.38 → 3509.46] against the Pharisees
[3509.46 → 3510.58] and the teachers of the law
[3510.58 → 3511.86] who thought they were better
[3511.86 → 3512.96] just because they worked
[3512.96 → 3514.26] close to God.
[3514.72 → 3515.46] Close to God.
[3516.80 → 3517.92] That's the pride
[3517.92 → 3518.92] that God opposes.
[3518.92 → 3522.62] because all of our workplaces
[3522.62 → 3524.20] and all of our vocations
[3524.20 → 3525.16] is the word we say,
[3525.62 → 3527.18] can reflect God's goodness
[3527.18 → 3528.66] and His redemptive plans
[3528.66 → 3529.36] and His kingdom
[3529.36 → 3530.42] for all creation.
[3531.14 → 3532.08] So whether you work
[3532.08 → 3532.62] for a church
[3532.62 → 3533.94] or for the local supermarket,
[3534.48 → 3535.78] our calling is to be
[3535.78 → 3536.88] disciples of Jesus
[3536.88 → 3537.80] every day
[3537.80 → 3539.22] and every step of our lives.
[3541.20 → 3542.32] And so just like
[3542.32 → 3543.18] the Sermon on the Mount
[3543.18 → 3544.86] where Jesus rebukes
[3544.86 → 3545.42] the Pharisees
[3545.42 → 3547.46] and the religiously proud,
[3547.46 → 3548.96] Jesus here
[3548.96 → 3549.96] is speaking to the heart.
[3550.34 → 3551.82] He's speaking against the pride
[3551.82 → 3553.26] that we are all tempted with
[3553.26 → 3554.48] even in our own hearts.
[3555.34 → 3556.04] And Dale Brunei,
[3556.16 → 3556.86] this commentator
[3556.86 → 3557.72] of this passage
[3557.72 → 3558.98] in the Gospel of Matthew,
[3559.36 → 3560.46] he captures the essence
[3560.46 → 3561.62] of this little part here.
[3561.94 → 3562.56] And he says,
[3562.92 → 3563.92] those who feel
[3563.92 → 3565.50] their spiritual brilliance
[3565.50 → 3566.98] and are sorry for those
[3566.98 → 3568.90] who fall so far beneath them,
[3569.26 → 3572.48] who bask in self-importance
[3572.48 → 3574.26] and feel God is lucky
[3574.26 → 3575.10] to have them,
[3575.10 → 3578.06] these find in Jesus' Father
[3578.06 → 3578.62] a back.
[3579.68 → 3581.66] But those who feel their sin
[3581.66 → 3583.02] are sorry for it
[3583.02 → 3584.86] and come asking for help,
[3585.30 → 3587.42] these find in Jesus' Father
[3587.42 → 3588.28] open arms.
[3590.04 → 3591.52] And these latter people,
[3592.20 → 3593.26] the people who come
[3593.26 → 3594.72] humbly before the Father,
[3595.20 → 3596.28] those who know
[3596.28 → 3597.44] that they are in need
[3597.44 → 3598.14] of a Saviour,
[3599.18 → 3601.00] these people,
[3601.14 → 3601.64] I should say,
[3601.96 → 3603.34] are the little children
[3603.34 → 3605.10] that Jesus is talking about.
[3605.18 → 3606.24] Hence our second question,
[3606.52 → 3607.82] who are the little children?
[3609.62 → 3611.22] These people
[3611.22 → 3612.94] that are like real children,
[3613.40 → 3615.98] that are real disciples of Christ,
[3616.96 → 3618.66] they are the ones
[3618.66 → 3619.82] that are called disciples
[3619.82 → 3621.78] as opposed to the crowd.
[3622.40 → 3623.44] You have to think of it, right?
[3623.66 → 3625.50] Whenever Jesus goes to a town
[3625.50 → 3627.14] or wherever he teaches,
[3627.62 → 3628.90] there are hundreds
[3628.90 → 3630.40] or even thousands of people
[3630.40 → 3631.22] that gather to him
[3631.22 → 3632.16] to try and hear
[3632.16 → 3633.08] what he has to say
[3633.08 → 3634.78] because he was known
[3634.78 → 3635.88] as a wise prophet,
[3636.02 → 3636.72] a good teacher.
[3637.50 → 3639.40] But then only those
[3639.40 → 3640.72] that were called disciples,
[3641.48 → 3642.56] they were the ones
[3642.56 → 3644.18] who came close to Jesus
[3644.18 → 3645.76] and tried to follow him
[3645.76 → 3646.54] in his ways
[3646.54 → 3648.38] because they are the ones
[3648.38 → 3650.58] that were not necessarily smarter.
[3651.14 → 3651.92] You have to think,
[3651.98 → 3653.96] even Jesus' original 12 disciples,
[3654.34 → 3655.32] they were not necessarily
[3655.32 → 3656.28] smarter people.
[3656.28 → 3658.94] They were just the people
[3658.94 → 3659.58] who knew
[3659.58 → 3661.36] that Jesus was their Saviour
[3661.36 → 3663.32] and that they were
[3663.32 → 3664.56] in total dependence
[3664.56 → 3665.44] and need of him.
[3666.50 → 3667.82] As opposed to the crowd
[3667.82 → 3669.38] who stood at a distance
[3669.38 → 3671.32] and said,
[3671.64 → 3672.16] all right Jesus,
[3672.32 → 3672.84] what you got?
[3673.72 → 3675.40] If you say the right things
[3675.40 → 3676.20] that I want to hear,
[3676.28 → 3676.98] then I'll stick around.
[3677.28 → 3678.56] If you say the things
[3678.56 → 3679.46] that I don't like,
[3679.84 → 3680.74] then I'll just leave.
[3681.16 → 3681.32] Right?
[3681.52 → 3682.58] That's the crowd
[3682.58 → 3684.32] as opposed to the disciples.
[3684.32 → 3687.06] And these are the ones
[3687.06 → 3687.58] that are called
[3687.58 → 3688.34] little children.
[3689.86 → 3691.02] Like Jesus teaches
[3691.02 → 3691.92] in the Beatitudes,
[3692.06 → 3692.22] right?
[3692.26 → 3692.76] At the beginning
[3692.76 → 3693.80] of the Sermon on the Mount,
[3694.44 → 3694.88] do you remember
[3694.88 → 3695.80] what the first one is?
[3696.46 → 3697.02] Blessed are,
[3697.12 → 3698.36] and you have a list of them?
[3699.02 → 3699.50] Oh, I mean,
[3699.86 → 3700.54] gave it away.
[3700.86 → 3701.68] Blessed are,
[3702.08 → 3703.82] blessed are the poor
[3703.82 → 3704.48] in spirit.
[3705.12 → 3706.34] The poor in spirit,
[3706.44 → 3706.98] the humble,
[3707.10 → 3708.20] the contrite in spirit.
[3709.06 → 3710.28] Yours is the kingdom
[3710.28 → 3710.80] of heaven.
[3711.60 → 3711.72] Right?
[3711.74 → 3712.58] That's what Jesus says
[3712.58 → 3713.72] and it's the same message.
[3713.72 → 3715.32] like little children.
[3715.76 → 3717.24] And even in Matthew 18,
[3717.58 → 3718.24] Jesus says,
[3718.56 → 3719.56] Truly I tell you,
[3719.84 → 3721.30] unless you change
[3721.30 → 3722.38] and become like
[3722.38 → 3724.10] little children,
[3724.62 → 3725.54] you will never enter
[3725.54 → 3726.40] the kingdom of heaven.
[3726.64 → 3727.56] And whoever welcomes
[3727.56 → 3728.58] one such child
[3728.58 → 3729.38] in my name
[3729.38 → 3730.92] welcomes me.
[3732.56 → 3733.56] So this kingdom
[3733.56 → 3735.32] is revealed to the humble.
[3735.62 → 3736.56] And this is
[3736.56 → 3737.50] the Father's will.
[3738.72 → 3740.32] This is the Father's will.
[3740.92 → 3741.82] And then we have to jump
[3741.82 → 3742.96] to the third question now.
[3742.96 → 3744.38] Because Jesus says,
[3744.88 → 3745.80] this will of the Father
[3745.80 → 3746.92] to reveal the kingdom
[3746.92 → 3748.06] to those that are humble,
[3748.72 → 3749.84] that come to God
[3749.84 → 3750.98] in total dependence,
[3751.22 → 3752.20] that are poor in spirit,
[3752.96 → 3753.38] He says,
[3753.52 → 3754.14] all of this,
[3754.32 → 3755.70] all of this Father's will
[3755.70 → 3757.48] is done exclusively
[3757.48 → 3758.70] through Him
[3758.70 → 3759.78] and Him alone.
[3761.96 → 3763.14] Jesus says that
[3763.14 → 3763.62] Santa,
[3763.90 → 3764.82] this is the Greek word
[3764.82 → 3765.76] saying everything,
[3766.42 → 3767.84] absolutely everything
[3767.84 → 3769.26] is in my hands.
[3769.26 → 3771.04] the Father
[3771.04 → 3773.80] reveals the kingdom
[3773.80 → 3774.48] to those
[3774.48 → 3775.48] that the Son
[3775.48 → 3776.58] chooses to reveal.
[3776.78 → 3777.82] The Father and the Son
[3777.82 → 3778.38] are one.
[3778.94 → 3779.52] So Jesus,
[3779.74 → 3780.36] in other words,
[3780.42 → 3781.58] is saying and claiming
[3781.58 → 3783.82] that He is God.
[3785.32 → 3786.38] Think about it.
[3786.80 → 3788.14] To those receiving
[3788.14 → 3789.00] Jesus' words
[3789.00 → 3790.10] right in this context,
[3790.82 → 3792.72] the monotheistic Jews,
[3792.88 → 3794.38] the Jews that only believe
[3794.38 → 3795.10] in one God,
[3795.18 → 3795.98] and rightly so,
[3795.98 → 3797.58] in the midst
[3797.58 → 3799.06] of a pantheistic,
[3799.66 → 3800.04] you know,
[3800.36 → 3801.12] pagan society
[3801.12 → 3801.64] that believed
[3801.64 → 3802.60] in a bunch
[3802.60 → 3803.28] of gods,
[3803.42 → 3803.70] plural,
[3804.46 → 3805.18] the Jews that were
[3805.18 → 3806.40] trying to hold on
[3806.40 → 3807.24] to their faith,
[3807.58 → 3808.82] believing in one God,
[3808.92 → 3809.78] this Jesus fellow
[3809.78 → 3811.04] comes in, and he says,
[3811.44 → 3812.80] I and the Father
[3812.80 → 3813.44] are one.
[3814.90 → 3816.20] The Father reveals
[3816.20 → 3816.60] the kingdom
[3816.60 → 3817.70] only through me.
[3819.40 → 3819.78] And so,
[3819.94 → 3820.72] even according
[3820.72 → 3821.36] to Scripture,
[3821.88 → 3822.48] even according
[3822.48 → 3823.24] to our own
[3823.24 → 3824.44] Old Testament,
[3824.86 → 3825.00] right,
[3825.00 → 3826.24] it is our Scripture too.
[3826.74 → 3827.84] According to Scripture,
[3828.34 → 3828.94] the Jews,
[3829.08 → 3829.66] the crowd,
[3829.88 → 3830.84] would have had
[3830.84 → 3831.48] the right,
[3832.36 → 3833.06] the justification
[3833.06 → 3834.66] to stone this man Jesus
[3834.66 → 3836.28] for making such a claim
[3836.28 → 3837.80] if his claim
[3837.80 → 3838.64] was not true.
[3839.80 → 3841.54] If Jesus' claim
[3841.54 → 3843.06] to be the Son of God,
[3843.16 → 3844.06] to be the Saviour
[3844.06 → 3845.28] and the Redeemer
[3845.28 → 3845.80] of the world,
[3845.88 → 3847.04] if that is not true,
[3847.20 → 3848.10] he should have
[3848.10 → 3849.18] rightly been stoned.
[3850.56 → 3851.58] But that is
[3851.58 → 3852.76] the call to faith,
[3852.80 → 3853.30] isn't it?
[3853.30 → 3855.40] Do you believe
[3855.40 → 3856.12] in Jesus
[3856.12 → 3857.20] as your Lord
[3857.20 → 3857.82] and Saviour?
[3859.04 → 3860.00] That is the question
[3860.00 → 3860.88] he is asking
[3860.88 → 3861.48] to the crowd,
[3861.72 → 3862.84] that he is asking us,
[3862.96 → 3864.18] that when we get baptized,
[3864.42 → 3866.30] that's the question,
[3866.60 → 3867.26] that is the call
[3867.26 → 3867.74] to faith
[3867.74 → 3868.56] that we confess
[3868.56 → 3869.10] ourselves.
[3870.10 → 3871.64] Do you believe
[3871.64 → 3872.44] and trust
[3872.44 → 3873.40] in Jesus Christ
[3873.40 → 3874.04] as your Lord
[3874.04 → 3874.50] and Saviour?
[3876.82 → 3877.84] This is what
[3877.84 → 3878.72] he is asking
[3878.72 → 3879.44] of the crowd.
[3879.44 → 3882.86] because to accept
[3882.86 → 3884.02] and confess
[3884.02 → 3885.30] that Jesus
[3885.30 → 3886.04] is Lord
[3886.04 → 3887.96] has huge implications
[3887.96 → 3888.82] for our lives.
[3889.22 → 3890.00] Confessing that
[3890.00 → 3891.66] Jesus is our Lord,
[3892.00 → 3893.30] that Jesus is Lord
[3893.30 → 3894.60] of my own life,
[3895.40 → 3896.12] it means that
[3896.12 → 3897.32] our whole life,
[3897.58 → 3898.70] our whole lives
[3898.70 → 3899.78] belong to him.
[3901.40 → 3902.72] We Christians,
[3903.62 → 3903.90] right,
[3904.10 → 3905.02] we disciple
[3905.02 → 3906.16] of Jesus Christ,
[3906.24 → 3906.96] the Son of God,
[3907.14 → 3907.82] are a people
[3907.82 → 3908.48] that believes
[3908.48 → 3909.32] and confesses
[3909.32 → 3910.16] that everything,
[3910.82 → 3912.38] absolutely everything,
[3913.00 → 3914.46] rests in Christ's hands.
[3916.22 → 3916.88] And so Paul,
[3917.04 → 3917.60] in his letter
[3917.60 → 3918.30] to the Colossians,
[3918.42 → 3918.72] says,
[3919.12 → 3919.86] for in him,
[3920.18 → 3921.54] in Christ,
[3921.98 → 3922.70] all things
[3922.70 → 3923.30] were created,
[3923.62 → 3924.32] things in heaven
[3924.32 → 3925.12] and on earth,
[3925.40 → 3926.70] visible and invisible,
[3927.10 → 3927.90] whether thrones
[3927.90 → 3928.56] or powers
[3928.56 → 3929.24] or authorities,
[3929.60 → 3930.42] all things
[3930.42 → 3931.12] have been created
[3931.12 → 3932.14] through Jesus
[3932.14 → 3933.46] and for Jesus.
[3933.98 → 3935.34] He is before
[3935.34 → 3936.08] all things
[3936.08 → 3937.84] and in Christ
[3937.84 → 3938.62] our Lord,
[3938.94 → 3939.66] all things
[3939.66 → 3940.40] hold together.
[3941.16 → 3942.24] Do you believe this?
[3945.44 → 3947.00] This is our salvation.
[3947.44 → 3947.88] It is through
[3947.88 → 3948.36] the death
[3948.36 → 3948.96] and resurrection
[3948.96 → 3949.56] of Jesus
[3949.56 → 3950.68] that we are called
[3950.68 → 3951.58] his children.
[3952.84 → 3954.32] Not by our own strength,
[3954.54 → 3955.90] not by our own works
[3955.90 → 3957.52] or our own wisdom
[3957.52 → 3958.24] and knowledge,
[3958.52 → 3958.76] right?
[3958.88 → 3959.60] That's what he's
[3959.60 → 3960.36] getting at here.
[3960.58 → 3962.14] It is not by your own strength
[3962.14 → 3962.78] that you are saved.
[3962.98 → 3964.42] It is not by your own
[3964.42 → 3965.92] scholarly smartness
[3965.92 → 3967.14] that you are saved.
[3967.82 → 3968.98] This is a gift
[3968.98 → 3969.94] from God.
[3972.64 → 3974.20] One of my favourite passages
[3974.20 → 3975.16] in Ephesians 2,
[3975.46 → 3976.62] for it is by grace
[3976.62 → 3977.60] you have been saved
[3977.60 → 3979.04] through faith.
[3979.28 → 3980.26] And this is not
[3980.26 → 3982.20] from your own works.
[3982.58 → 3984.12] It is the gift of God.
[3986.12 → 3988.44] That is our baptismal identity.
[3988.60 → 3989.58] That is our salvation.
[3990.00 → 3991.30] And we say amen to this.
[3992.04 → 3992.48] Amen.
[3992.48 → 3995.36] But we have to understand
[3995.36 → 3997.50] even Paul does not stop there.
[3998.44 → 3999.96] We were saved through grace,
[4000.64 → 4001.36] by grace,
[4001.48 → 4002.04] through faith.
[4003.08 → 4003.90] Yes and amen.
[4004.04 → 4004.62] All the way.
[4005.92 → 4007.18] But then it's always
[4007.18 → 4008.26] so that.
[4009.80 → 4011.12] How does Paul end
[4011.12 → 4012.14] this little passage
[4012.14 → 4012.82] in Ephesians?
[4014.82 → 4015.26] For.
[4015.82 → 4016.22] For.
[4016.40 → 4017.02] So that.
[4017.44 → 4019.16] We are God's handiwork
[4019.16 → 4020.44] created, again,
[4020.44 → 4021.58] in Christ Jesus.
[4021.58 → 4022.98] Everything is in His hands.
[4023.54 → 4024.10] To do what?
[4024.84 → 4026.42] To do good works.
[4026.54 → 4027.58] It is not by works
[4027.58 → 4028.12] you are saved.
[4028.38 → 4029.16] You are saved
[4029.16 → 4030.06] so that
[4030.06 → 4031.12] you can do
[4031.12 → 4031.94] the good works
[4031.94 → 4033.28] that God has prepared
[4033.28 → 4034.12] in advance
[4034.12 → 4035.12] for us to do.
[4035.80 → 4037.50] Everything is in His hands.
[4038.32 → 4039.20] And as we
[4039.20 → 4040.32] are invited
[4040.32 → 4041.42] to be His disciples,
[4041.64 → 4042.60] we are now equipped
[4042.60 → 4043.50] by the Holy Spirit
[4043.50 → 4044.88] to do the good works
[4044.88 → 4045.66] that He has prepared
[4045.66 → 4046.20] in advance
[4046.20 → 4047.26] for us to do.
[4047.26 → 4050.14] That now enlightens us
[4050.14 → 4051.70] for this last question.
[4052.12 → 4053.24] How exactly
[4053.24 → 4054.90] is Jesus' yoke
[4054.90 → 4056.04] easy and His burden
[4056.04 → 4056.44] light?
[4056.80 → 4058.26] It doesn't feel
[4058.26 → 4059.24] that way all the time.
[4060.08 → 4060.84] To be disciples
[4060.84 → 4061.36] of Jesus
[4061.36 → 4062.96] actually put us
[4062.96 → 4063.92] in the face of
[4063.92 → 4065.84] a lot of spiritual
[4065.84 → 4066.32] battles,
[4066.60 → 4067.58] even persecution,
[4068.22 → 4069.84] all across the globe.
[4070.32 → 4071.34] So how is this
[4071.34 → 4072.02] good news?
[4072.36 → 4073.76] How is Jesus'
[4073.76 → 4074.96] yoke easy
[4074.96 → 4076.06] for us?
[4076.06 → 4076.74] How?
[4079.38 → 4080.48] From the good news,
[4080.56 → 4081.22] from God's word,
[4081.30 → 4081.92] I suggest
[4081.92 → 4083.56] the answer is
[4083.56 → 4084.56] is that
[4084.56 → 4085.42] we take on
[4085.42 → 4086.54] Jesus' yoke.
[4086.64 → 4087.52] That's the key.
[4088.22 → 4089.24] We take on
[4089.24 → 4090.46] the yoke of Christ.
[4090.58 → 4091.38] That's the invitation.
[4092.20 → 4092.70] And notice,
[4092.86 → 4094.18] it's not to take on
[4094.18 → 4095.14] our own yoke
[4095.14 → 4096.46] that is now strengthened
[4096.46 → 4097.30] and made better
[4097.30 → 4097.84] or something.
[4098.36 → 4099.16] Jesus does not
[4099.16 → 4099.98] invite us to say,
[4100.08 → 4100.26] alright,
[4100.50 → 4101.78] put on your yokes again.
[4102.04 → 4102.76] I'm just going to
[4102.76 → 4103.70] strengthen that yoke
[4103.70 → 4104.68] and make it easier
[4104.68 → 4105.12] or lighter,
[4105.12 → 4106.40] but it's your yoke.
[4106.54 → 4107.34] Put on that yoke
[4107.34 → 4108.12] and then continue
[4108.12 → 4108.78] on the work.
[4109.30 → 4109.56] No.
[4109.88 → 4110.56] The invitation
[4110.56 → 4111.60] that Jesus extends
[4111.60 → 4112.18] to us
[4112.18 → 4113.10] and to the people
[4113.10 → 4113.88] listening here,
[4113.94 → 4114.40] he says,
[4114.68 → 4116.58] take on my yoke
[4116.58 → 4117.72] for it is easy
[4117.72 → 4118.52] and my burden
[4118.52 → 4119.04] is light.
[4119.90 → 4121.00] I am the way,
[4121.08 → 4121.44] the truth,
[4121.50 → 4121.98] and the life.
[4122.36 → 4123.28] I am the way
[4123.28 → 4124.78] to real flourishing,
[4125.20 → 4126.16] real blessing,
[4126.58 → 4128.50] and real rest.
[4128.50 → 4134.44] this is why
[4134.44 → 4135.56] Jesus uses
[4135.56 → 4137.10] a work tool
[4137.10 → 4138.72] for this image.
[4139.16 → 4140.34] Not a chair,
[4140.62 → 4141.30] not a bed,
[4141.42 → 4142.90] not a nice lawn chair
[4142.90 → 4143.38] or something.
[4143.62 → 4145.04] He uses a yoke
[4145.04 → 4145.96] to teach us.
[4147.84 → 4149.12] Jesus is showing us
[4149.12 → 4149.86] that obedience
[4149.86 → 4151.12] to his teachings,
[4151.50 → 4153.40] to learn from him
[4153.40 → 4155.04] and to do life
[4155.04 → 4155.72] with him
[4155.72 → 4158.16] leads to real rest,
[4158.50 → 4159.62] leads to real Sabbath.
[4161.02 → 4162.36] We look for that
[4162.36 → 4164.06] all in our lives,
[4164.24 → 4165.22] wherever it may be.
[4165.50 → 4166.38] We try to find
[4166.38 → 4167.26] the right yokes,
[4167.74 → 4168.70] the right things
[4168.70 → 4169.82] to give us rest.
[4169.94 → 4170.64] We really,
[4171.00 → 4172.78] desperately desire rest
[4172.78 → 4174.48] because that's how
[4174.48 → 4175.24] we were created.
[4175.24 → 4177.80] But Jesus is saying,
[4178.88 → 4179.86] I am the only way
[4179.86 → 4181.02] you find that rest.
[4182.14 → 4183.20] And how do you do it?
[4183.24 → 4184.18] You put on my yoke.
[4184.70 → 4185.64] My yoke.
[4188.16 → 4189.66] Jesus comes to restore
[4189.66 → 4190.34] and to heal
[4190.34 → 4192.04] and he is inviting us
[4192.04 → 4192.92] into that life
[4192.92 → 4195.58] to be his disciples,
[4195.96 → 4197.24] to do live with him.
[4197.34 → 4198.40] Not just learning
[4198.40 → 4199.14] and putting more
[4199.14 → 4200.08] religious information
[4200.08 → 4200.72] in our heads,
[4200.88 → 4202.24] but following him
[4202.24 → 4203.36] with our whole lives
[4203.36 → 4204.46] because we confess
[4204.46 → 4205.92] that our whole lives
[4205.92 → 4207.00] belong to him.
[4207.30 → 4208.56] Absolutely everything
[4208.56 → 4210.14] is in his hands.
[4211.00 → 4211.90] And many times
[4211.90 → 4212.88] this may seem
[4212.88 → 4214.26] like a daunting task,
[4214.74 → 4215.96] but Jesus extends
[4215.96 → 4217.06] a personal invitation.
[4217.36 → 4218.10] Come to me.
[4218.90 → 4219.60] Come to me.
[4220.50 → 4221.36] Jesus invites
[4221.36 → 4222.72] those who are weary
[4222.72 → 4223.58] and burdened,
[4223.82 → 4224.70] those who are having
[4224.70 → 4225.78] a hard time of it,
[4226.08 → 4226.84] those for whom
[4226.84 → 4228.50] life is hard work
[4228.50 → 4230.18] and feel overwhelmed.
[4231.12 → 4232.06] And to go a little deeper,
[4232.24 → 4233.22] Jesus calls
[4233.22 → 4234.06] to him,
[4234.20 → 4234.90] those who are
[4234.90 → 4235.96] even discouraged,
[4236.52 → 4237.64] those who want
[4237.64 → 4238.26] to be good,
[4239.26 → 4241.80] who want to please God,
[4242.16 → 4243.98] to love and serve others,
[4244.48 → 4245.66] but many times
[4245.66 → 4247.80] feel quite selfish,
[4248.40 → 4250.22] quite uncut to the task,
[4250.70 → 4251.68] quite inadequate,
[4252.18 → 4253.22] and even feel like
[4253.22 → 4254.30] failures at times.
[4254.30 → 4258.12] And so to those
[4258.12 → 4258.90] who are burdened
[4258.90 → 4259.38] with guilt
[4259.38 → 4260.36] and inadequacy,
[4261.12 → 4261.82] Jesus now
[4261.82 → 4262.44] appears
[4262.44 → 4264.30] and promises,
[4264.54 → 4265.22] first,
[4265.68 → 4266.32] refreshment,
[4266.46 → 4267.48] rest for our souls,
[4268.14 → 4269.30] but then more importantly,
[4269.84 → 4270.72] or just as important,
[4270.84 → 4271.30] I should say,
[4271.68 → 4273.22] equipment for carrying
[4273.22 → 4274.16] our future burdens
[4274.16 → 4274.70] and duties.
[4275.16 → 4275.82] And that's why
[4275.82 → 4276.86] this is good news.
[4277.66 → 4278.24] We are called
[4278.24 → 4278.90] to take on
[4278.90 → 4279.78] his yoke.
[4279.78 → 4282.50] And as I finish,
[4282.66 → 4283.26] just to reinforce
[4283.26 → 4283.76] this point
[4283.76 → 4284.84] just a little bit further,
[4285.20 → 4286.10] remember that image
[4286.10 → 4286.68] of the yoke
[4286.68 → 4287.82] that I started off with?
[4288.58 → 4290.06] A yoke usually entails
[4290.06 → 4290.90] how many oxen
[4290.90 → 4291.54] pulling the cart?
[4292.36 → 4293.44] It usually entails
[4293.44 → 4294.52] two on each side.
[4295.26 → 4296.60] So another reason
[4296.60 → 4297.12] I think
[4297.12 → 4298.20] that Jesus uses
[4298.20 → 4299.68] a yoke
[4299.68 → 4300.66] for this image,
[4301.02 → 4301.76] for this teaching,
[4302.12 → 4303.06] is because
[4303.06 → 4303.96] the image
[4303.96 → 4304.68] that we should get
[4304.68 → 4305.26] is not just
[4305.26 → 4305.86] putting something
[4305.86 → 4306.88] on us to work.
[4307.84 → 4308.64] Jesus is carrying
[4308.64 → 4309.68] that yoke with us.
[4310.48 → 4311.38] He's inviting us
[4311.38 → 4312.38] to walk with him
[4312.38 → 4313.30] step by step.
[4314.32 → 4315.36] That's what leads
[4315.36 → 4316.20] to real life
[4316.20 → 4317.56] and real flourishing.
[4318.38 → 4319.34] So we take on
[4319.34 → 4319.76] the yoke
[4319.76 → 4320.58] of our Lord Jesus,
[4320.96 → 4321.82] becoming a witness
[4321.82 → 4322.86] to his healing
[4322.86 → 4324.34] and his restorative
[4324.34 → 4325.22] work for the world,
[4325.62 → 4326.70] even in our
[4326.70 → 4327.76] sin-filled,
[4328.30 → 4329.64] broken workplaces,
[4330.02 → 4331.00] even when our
[4331.00 → 4331.62] co-workers
[4331.62 → 4332.70] are jerks sometimes,
[4333.04 → 4333.78] even when our
[4333.78 → 4334.60] work environment
[4334.60 → 4335.60] is so toxic.
[4335.60 → 4337.14] And throughout
[4337.14 → 4338.10] the countless
[4338.10 → 4339.20] conversations I had
[4339.20 → 4339.90] with our young adults
[4339.90 → 4340.46] at our church,
[4341.36 → 4342.22] I haven't met
[4342.22 → 4343.18] a single young adult
[4343.18 → 4344.00] who tells me
[4344.00 → 4345.10] my workplace
[4345.10 → 4347.28] is not toxic.
[4348.30 → 4348.40] Right?
[4349.28 → 4350.72] In whatever shape
[4350.72 → 4351.14] or manner,
[4351.30 → 4352.04] every young adult
[4352.04 → 4352.72] I talk to,
[4352.88 → 4353.24] sadly,
[4353.72 → 4354.26] says that
[4354.26 → 4355.18] my workplace
[4355.18 → 4356.06] is toxic.
[4358.44 → 4359.46] But even
[4359.46 → 4360.14] in that
[4360.14 → 4361.32] broken environment,
[4362.60 → 4362.82] right,
[4362.82 → 4363.28] we're not
[4363.28 → 4364.32] called to put
[4364.32 → 4364.82] on the yokes
[4364.82 → 4365.56] of our different
[4365.56 → 4366.28] workplaces,
[4366.60 → 4367.36] we are called
[4367.36 → 4367.90] to put on
[4367.90 → 4368.68] the yoke of Christ
[4368.68 → 4369.72] who walks along
[4369.72 → 4370.74] side by side
[4370.74 → 4371.32] with us.
[4372.28 → 4373.40] And in that way,
[4373.68 → 4375.14] we have real hope
[4375.14 → 4376.18] in Jesus
[4376.18 → 4377.06] as our Saviour
[4377.06 → 4377.52] and Lord.
[4378.70 → 4379.44] And through that
[4379.44 → 4380.10] hope and that
[4380.10 → 4380.88] equipping of
[4380.88 → 4382.18] the Spirit now sent
[4382.18 → 4383.44] and fills us
[4383.44 → 4384.82] and dwells within us,
[4385.22 → 4386.32] we can be that
[4386.32 → 4387.50] light that we
[4387.50 → 4388.44] prayed about,
[4388.60 → 4389.72] that we know about.
[4389.72 → 4390.72] We can be that
[4390.72 → 4391.72] light even
[4391.72 → 4393.28] in our workplaces.
[4393.96 → 4394.44] And that's the
[4394.44 → 4394.90] invitation.
[4395.40 → 4395.88] And that's the
[4395.88 → 4396.92] blessing that Jesus
[4396.92 → 4398.56] gifts us
[4398.56 → 4399.40] through His Word
[4399.40 → 4399.74] today.
[4400.60 → 4400.82] Amen?
[4401.80 → 4402.36] Amen.
[4402.98 → 4403.74] And so just like
[4403.74 → 4404.36] the psalmist,
[4405.26 → 4406.12] we end with this,
[4406.20 → 4407.06] just like the psalmist,
[4407.16 → 4408.22] the famous Psalm 23,
[4408.74 → 4409.80] the Lord is my
[4409.80 → 4410.08] shepherd.
[4410.58 → 4411.54] I lack nothing.
[4412.68 → 4413.34] And the important
[4413.34 → 4413.90] gospel,
[4414.38 → 4414.88] the good news
[4414.88 → 4415.66] from this psalm,
[4415.96 → 4417.26] is that the Lord
[4417.26 → 4418.36] is my shepherd.
[4418.86 → 4419.48] Not me,
[4419.72 → 4420.68] not use,
[4420.90 → 4421.82] the Lord is.
[4422.38 → 4423.18] And so we lack
[4423.18 → 4423.58] nothing.
[4423.90 → 4424.96] Because He,
[4425.38 → 4426.28] and He alone,
[4426.56 → 4427.08] is the shepherd
[4427.08 → 4427.86] of our lives.
[4429.38 → 4430.12] Let's pray.
[4436.12 → 4437.02] Loving Father,
[4437.78 → 4438.54] we thank You
[4438.54 → 4439.28] for the good news
[4439.28 → 4439.78] this morning,
[4440.32 → 4441.66] that You invite us
[4441.66 → 4442.42] to take on
[4442.42 → 4443.08] Your yoke.
[4444.68 → 4445.18] Lord,
[4445.22 → 4445.74] I just want to
[4445.74 → 4446.32] name that
[4446.32 → 4447.48] many times
[4447.48 → 4449.22] being Your
[4449.22 → 4449.92] disciple may
[4449.92 → 4450.58] not seem
[4450.58 → 4451.32] so easy.
[4452.50 → 4453.54] And many times
[4453.54 → 4454.44] this burden
[4454.44 → 4456.02] to be a light
[4456.02 → 4456.56] for the world
[4456.56 → 4457.72] may not feel
[4457.72 → 4458.36] so light.
[4459.90 → 4460.80] But thank You,
[4460.90 → 4460.98] Lord,
[4461.04 → 4461.74] for the good news
[4461.74 → 4462.58] and reminding us,
[4462.72 → 4462.82] Lord,
[4462.88 → 4463.74] that we belong
[4463.74 → 4464.48] to You,
[4464.96 → 4465.90] that everything
[4465.90 → 4467.10] is in Your hands,
[4467.22 → 4467.90] not ours.
[4469.06 → 4469.82] Thank You
[4469.82 → 4470.92] for teaching us
[4470.92 → 4474.06] that You,

[4474.84 → 4474.88] that You
[4474.88 → 4476.12] require humility
[4476.12 → 4476.96] and mercy.
[4477.92 → 4479.18] Not pride,
[4479.60 → 4480.50] not our own
[4480.50 → 4481.16] ingenuity,
[4481.42 → 4482.30] not our own
[4482.30 → 4483.54] wisdom
[4483.54 → 4484.94] or our own
[4484.94 → 4485.76] smartness,
[4486.26 → 4487.62] but You require
[4487.62 → 4488.54] humility.
[4489.54 → 4490.82] And You want us
[4490.82 → 4491.94] to bow before You
[4491.94 → 4493.16] and depend on You
[4493.16 → 4493.90] because You
[4493.90 → 4495.00] and You alone
[4495.00 → 4496.04] are our Saviour.
[4496.04 → 4496.16] Saviour.

[4500.86 → 4502.00] and guides us
[4502.00 → 4503.18] every step of the way
[4503.18 → 4504.66] to equip us
[4504.66 → 4506.02] to take on
[4506.02 → 4507.24] the sometimes
[4507.24 → 4508.30] daunting task
[4508.30 → 4509.62] to live out
[4509.62 → 4510.44] as Your disciples.

[4523.82 → 4524.68] and all glory
[4524.68 → 4525.20] to You,
[4525.32 → 4525.54] Lord.
[4526.00 → 4526.72] In Jesus' name
[4526.72 → 4527.10] we pray.

[4579.72 → 4580.92] that heaven
[4580.92 → 4581.72] can't heal.
[4582.38 → 4584.64] Earth has no sorrow

[4640.84 → 4643.04] Come sit at the table,
[4643.04 → 4645.32] who takes the grace.

[4648.54 → 4650.58] rest that endures.
[4651.00 → 4652.78] Earth has no sorrow
[4652.78 → 4655.58] that heaven can cure.

[4695.86 → 4701.28] Come as you are.
[4701.28 → 4706.24] fall in His arms,
[4706.24 → 4709.24] come as you are.
[4712.02 → 4714.66] There's joy for the morning,
[4715.16 → 4717.34] will still be.
[4717.34 → 4719.78] Earth has no sorrow
[4719.78 → 4722.34] that heaven can't heal.
[4722.68 → 4724.78] Earth has no sorrow
[4724.78 → 4727.86] that heaven can't heal.
[4727.86 → 4732.92] So lay down your burdens,
[4732.92 → 4737.40] lay down your shame.
[4737.40 → 4742.46] all who are broken,
[4742.46 → 4743.46] all who are broken,
[4743.46 → 4748.46] lift your own pace.
[4748.46 → 4753.46] O wanderer, come home,
[4753.46 → 4756.96] you're not too far.
[4756.96 → 4762.02] So lay down your heart,
[4762.02 → 4763.02] lay down your heart,

[4764.30 → 4766.76] come as you are.
[4773.76 → 4775.90] Come as you are.
[4778.60 → 4781.40] Come as you are.
[4781.40 → 4786.46] Come as you are.
[4796.46 → 4798.60] And so receive this blessing
[4798.60 → 4802.30] as we are sent to be His disciples,
[4802.62 → 4804.68] to be the light for a world
[4804.68 → 4805.48] that's in darkness,
[4805.84 → 4807.18] that is in desperate need
[4807.18 → 4808.52] of a Saviour as well.
[4808.52 → 4812.32] May our Lord Jesus Christ Himself
[4812.32 → 4814.22] and God our Father,
[4814.72 → 4815.78] who loved us
[4815.78 → 4817.18] and by His grace
[4817.18 → 4819.36] gave us eternal encouragement
[4819.36 → 4820.26] and good hope.
[4820.84 → 4822.70] May He encourage your hearts
[4822.70 → 4824.22] and strengthen you
[4824.22 → 4825.34] and equip you
[4825.34 → 4827.70] in every good deed and word.
[4828.08 → 4829.24] And all God's people said,
[4829.84 → 4830.44] Amen.
[4830.44 → 4830.56] Amen.
[4838.52 → 4858.64] Be like I got a favourite hand,
