[2249.72 → 2279.70] Thank you.
[2279.72 → 2309.70] I will sing.
[2309.72 → 2339.70] I will sing.
[2339.72 → 2369.70] Thank you.
[2369.70 → 2399.68] Thank you.
[2399.70 → 2429.68] As we come to hear you.
[2429.68 → 2459.66] Thank you.
[2459.66 → 2489.66] 
[2489.66 → 2496.64] I' Indigenous.
[2496.64 → 2503.22] what wondrous love is this
[2503.22 → 2509.36] we pray in Jesus name amen
[2509.36 → 2520.26] tonight for our time here I'm going to do things just a little bit
[2520.26 → 2524.52] differently than how we normally do in our worship together
[2524.52 → 2530.60] tonight as we sort of rehearse the drama of scripture
[2530.60 → 2538.82] I'm going to invite you to live into the narrative of Jesus death
[2538.82 → 2545.06] and so unlike we ordinarily do I'm not going to read the text at the beginning
[2545.06 → 2552.88] but we're going to read it and hear it together throughout our time
[2552.88 → 2556.64] and so if you have a bible I do encourage you to
[2556.64 → 2560.58] open it up or if it's on your phone to turn that on to get that out and to have
[2560.58 → 2564.96] Matthew 27 verse 45 to 56 in front of you
[2564.96 → 2569.28] but we're going to move through it slowly together
[2569.28 → 2578.48] here in this time through this text in this particular moment
[2578.48 → 2586.80] I hope that you will see that the death of Jesus is the death of God
[2586.80 → 2592.90] and I hope that you will see how it is that we killed him
[2592.90 → 2597.62] now to temper your expectations a little bit
[2597.62 → 2602.56] I am very confident that you're going to leave tonight unsatisfied
[2602.56 → 2606.96] but that is our aim
[2606.96 → 2612.54] because we're going to carry this story to Sunday
[2612.54 → 2614.84] it's Friday
[2614.84 → 2617.48] but Sunday's coming
[2617.48 → 2619.96] but for right now
[2619.96 → 2622.58] let's live in Friday
[2622.58 → 2627.04] and so the stage is set for us
[2627.04 → 2632.18] from noon until three in the afternoon
[2632.18 → 2635.98] darkness came all over the land
[2635.98 → 2646.26] 750 years before this event took place
[2646.26 → 2651.92] the prophet Amos had a vision of the Lord
[2651.92 → 2653.80] and in his vision
[2653.80 → 2655.26] the Lord says
[2655.26 → 2658.98] in that day I will make the sun go down at noon
[2658.98 → 2661.16] and darken the earth in broad daylight
[2661.16 → 2665.96] I will make that time like morning for an only sun
[2665.96 → 2669.14] in the end of it like a bitter day
[2669.14 → 2673.86] at this moment with Jesus
[2673.86 → 2680.50] the whole of creation portends this momentous moment
[2680.50 → 2685.32] Dale Brunei describes this
[2685.32 → 2689.50] as the world putting on mourners cloths
[2689.50 → 2690.60] dark clothing
[2690.60 → 2695.28] for the death of God's son is happening
[2695.28 → 2697.48] he writes
[2697.48 → 2700.40] the son of God came into the world
[2700.40 → 2703.02] and in response the world's best religion
[2703.02 → 2703.66] Judaism
[2703.66 → 2706.18] and its most advanced government
[2706.18 → 2707.88] the Roman Empire
[2707.88 → 2710.12] combined to kill him
[2710.12 → 2712.52] and in great sympathy
[2712.52 → 2716.34] the earth plunges into darkness
[2716.34 → 2720.08] see the scope of Jesus' death
[2720.08 → 2721.78] isn't just on that hill
[2721.78 → 2723.02] over in Judea
[2723.02 → 2724.40] outside of Jerusalem
[2724.40 → 2725.94] even though it is there
[2725.94 → 2727.18] and I've stood in that place
[2727.18 → 2728.06] right
[2728.06 → 2729.52] the scope of Jesus' death
[2729.52 → 2731.36] isn't even just salvation
[2731.36 → 2732.66] for sinners
[2732.66 → 2733.92] from the wrath of God
[2733.92 → 2734.42] for sin
[2734.42 → 2736.08] even though I know that truth
[2736.08 → 2738.10] and I celebrate it daily
[2738.10 → 2740.60] the scope of Jesus' death
[2740.60 → 2741.80] of what is happening here
[2741.80 → 2742.62] in this text
[2742.62 → 2745.18] is cosmic in its spread
[2745.18 → 2747.84] and so all creation groans
[2747.84 → 2750.24] all creation mourns
[2750.24 → 2752.22] and all creation waits
[2752.22 → 2753.66] for what's next
[2753.66 → 2755.26] it's Friday
[2755.26 → 2757.58] but Sunday's coming
[2757.58 → 2761.60] now this darkness ends
[2761.60 → 2764.20] as Jesus' inner experience
[2764.20 → 2765.48] of darkness reaches
[2765.48 → 2768.00] its fever pitch
[2768.00 → 2770.30] and about three in the afternoon
[2770.30 → 2772.24] Jesus cried out in a loud voice
[2772.24 → 2775.46] Eli, Eli, Mammoth, Tabathconee
[2775.46 → 2777.08] which means
[2777.08 → 2778.12] my God
[2778.12 → 2779.28] my God
[2779.28 → 2780.80] why have you
[2780.80 → 2782.30] forsaken me?
[2782.30 → 2785.18] these are the very same words
[2785.18 → 2786.20] that we began
[2786.20 → 2787.48] our worship with
[2787.48 → 2788.86] and this sentence
[2788.86 → 2790.10] this sentence
[2790.10 → 2791.90] is the gospel
[2791.90 → 2793.78] at its deepest
[2793.78 → 2797.60] but as I was preparing
[2797.60 → 2799.26] to share this with you
[2799.26 → 2799.86] and to lead
[2799.86 → 2800.34] and this
[2800.34 → 2801.60] kept coming back
[2801.60 → 2802.82] to this idea
[2802.82 → 2803.58] and what I find
[2803.58 → 2804.66] so amazing
[2804.66 → 2805.80] right now
[2805.80 → 2806.54] and right here
[2806.54 → 2807.04] is that
[2807.04 → 2810.24] Jesus'
[2811.20 → 2812.56] last words
[2812.56 → 2815.02] are a question
[2815.02 → 2818.88] have you ever thought about that?
[2819.70 → 2819.80] right
[2819.80 → 2820.80] it's not a declaration
[2820.80 → 2822.72] it's not a command
[2822.72 → 2824.44] it's not an invitation
[2824.44 → 2825.70] right
[2825.70 → 2826.22] think about it
[2826.22 → 2827.70] it's supposed to be
[2827.70 → 2828.74] a moment of victory
[2828.74 → 2829.94] and maybe
[2829.94 → 2831.20] you come into this story
[2831.20 → 2831.52] thinking
[2831.52 → 2831.84] you know what
[2831.84 → 2833.12] it shouldn't have even had to happen
[2833.12 → 2834.08] in the way that it did
[2834.08 → 2834.96] right
[2834.96 → 2836.02] maybe you want Jesus
[2836.02 → 2837.14] on the cross
[2837.14 → 2838.16] to say something like
[2838.16 → 2838.58] this
[2838.58 → 2840.14] this is love
[2840.14 → 2841.84] or maybe
[2841.84 → 2842.72] for him to
[2842.72 → 2843.98] to stand there
[2843.98 → 2844.72] and to look
[2844.72 → 2845.40] at the
[2845.40 → 2846.00] the women
[2846.00 → 2846.98] who are close
[2846.98 → 2847.94] and the disciples
[2847.94 → 2848.82] who have led
[2848.82 → 2849.52] left
[2849.52 → 2850.82] and for him to say
[2850.82 → 2852.32] love one another
[2852.32 → 2854.08] right
[2854.08 → 2855.46] we want his final words
[2855.46 → 2856.52] to be triumphant
[2856.52 → 2857.86] we want his final words
[2857.86 → 2858.98] to be an invitation
[2858.98 → 2860.92] to join in the triumph
[2860.92 → 2861.86] of what is to come
[2861.86 → 2863.84] but questions
[2863.84 → 2867.80] why questions
[2867.80 → 2870.70] and yeah
[2870.70 → 2871.64] I don't know about you
[2871.64 → 2871.88] but
[2871.88 → 2873.16] but there's something
[2873.16 → 2876.14] there's something more real
[2876.14 → 2878.20] about questions
[2878.20 → 2879.90] right
[2879.90 → 2880.86] at this moment
[2880.86 → 2881.92] like at the moment
[2881.92 → 2883.40] in the garden of Gethsemane
[2883.40 → 2884.30] when he prayed
[2884.30 → 2885.02] and he was
[2885.02 → 2886.98] sweating drops of blood
[2886.98 → 2888.14] and he asked for the cup
[2888.14 → 2889.26] to be removed from him
[2889.26 → 2889.64] right
[2889.64 → 2890.56] at this moment
[2890.56 → 2891.60] we see Jesus
[2891.60 → 2893.42] not only taking on
[2893.42 → 2894.10] flesh
[2894.10 → 2895.20] in the incarnation
[2895.20 → 2896.70] but we see Jesus
[2896.70 → 2898.84] taking on our anxieties
[2898.84 → 2899.94] and our fears
[2899.94 → 2900.72] we see Jesus
[2900.72 → 2901.96] taking on our feelings
[2901.96 → 2903.00] and our nerves
[2903.00 → 2904.56] right
[2904.56 → 2905.82] all throughout the gospel story
[2905.82 → 2906.24] of Jesus
[2906.24 → 2907.16] in his life
[2907.16 → 2907.90] he's given us
[2907.90 → 2909.02] so many answers
[2909.02 → 2911.00] and he's still answering
[2911.00 → 2911.98] questions for us
[2911.98 → 2913.36] but at this moment
[2913.36 → 2914.32] right now
[2914.32 → 2915.40] he's asking
[2915.40 → 2916.76] my questions
[2916.76 → 2918.24] he's asking
[2918.24 → 2919.52] your questions
[2919.52 → 2920.70] he's asking our
[2920.70 → 2921.54] questions
[2921.54 → 2922.06] God
[2922.06 → 2923.80] why have you forsaken me
[2923.80 → 2925.96] why have you abandoned me
[2925.96 → 2928.86] this question tells us
[2928.86 → 2929.68] that the cross
[2929.68 → 2930.78] isn't only about
[2930.78 → 2931.62] physical pain
[2931.62 → 2933.58] but there's a very real
[2933.58 → 2934.40] and a very deep
[2934.40 → 2935.48] spiritual pain
[2935.48 → 2936.56] there's a very real
[2936.56 → 2937.18] and a very deep
[2937.18 → 2938.56] relational pain
[2938.56 → 2939.72] there's an anguish
[2939.72 → 2941.14] and an alienation
[2941.14 → 2943.22] that Jesus is experiencing here
[2943.22 → 2944.16] and the cry
[2944.16 → 2945.20] into the darkness
[2945.20 → 2946.10] why me
[2946.10 → 2951.30] is only
[2951.30 → 2953.42] echoed back to him
[2953.42 → 2955.12] in his agony
[2955.12 → 2958.40] for no answer is given
[2958.40 → 2961.32] sometimes
[2961.32 → 2963.88] we taste
[2963.88 → 2965.26] this same
[2965.26 → 2966.54] agony
[2966.54 → 2970.40] sometimes
[2970.40 → 2972.16] we taste
[2972.16 → 2972.98] this same
[2972.98 → 2973.74] agony
[2973.74 → 2974.68] the hole
[2974.68 → 2975.28] that's left
[2975.28 → 2975.82] behind
[2975.82 → 2976.54] when someone
[2976.54 → 2977.16] we love
[2977.16 → 2978.00] dies
[2978.00 → 2979.26] that's this
[2979.26 → 2979.62] agony
[2979.62 → 2981.98] the abandonment
[2981.98 → 2982.52] we feel
[2982.52 → 2983.48] when a spouse
[2983.48 → 2984.08] leaves
[2984.08 → 2985.00] that's this
[2985.00 → 2985.40] agony
[2985.40 → 2986.98] the loneliness
[2986.98 → 2987.74] we experience
[2987.74 → 2988.28] when a parent
[2988.28 → 2989.32] runs away
[2989.32 → 2991.80] when a dear
[2991.80 → 2992.32] friend
[2992.32 → 2993.72] is taken over
[2993.72 → 2994.44] into addiction
[2994.44 → 2996.58] all of these
[2996.58 → 2997.84] little experiences
[2997.84 → 2998.52] of hell
[2998.52 → 2999.38] are a taste
[2999.38 → 3000.38] of what Jesus
[3000.38 → 3001.10] goes through
[3001.10 → 3001.76] on the cross
[3001.76 → 3003.16] death
[3003.16 → 3004.46] and abandonment
[3004.46 → 3005.10] loneliness
[3005.10 → 3006.04] and rejection
[3006.04 → 3007.12] desertion
[3007.12 → 3007.80] Jesus
[3007.80 → 3008.98] is in that
[3008.98 → 3009.50] hell
[3009.50 → 3010.08] too
[3010.08 → 3012.82] later
[3012.82 → 3014.24] in 2nd
[3014.24 → 3015.04] Corinthians 5
[3015.04 → 3015.94] we read
[3015.94 → 3018.34] God made him
[3018.34 → 3019.10] who had
[3019.10 → 3019.92] no sin
[3019.92 → 3020.68] to be
[3020.68 → 3021.24] sin
[3021.24 → 3022.52] for us
[3022.52 → 3025.60] God made
[3025.60 → 3026.32] him
[3026.32 → 3026.90] Jesus
[3026.90 → 3027.78] who had
[3027.78 → 3029.02] no sin
[3029.02 → 3029.46] and so
[3029.46 → 3029.96] when Jesus
[3029.96 → 3030.52] asks
[3030.52 → 3031.22] why have
[3031.22 → 3031.96] you have forsaken
[3031.96 → 3032.50] me
[3032.50 → 3033.86] that's why
[3033.86 → 3034.42] this question
[3034.42 → 3035.20] is so poignant
[3035.20 → 3036.60] because Jesus
[3036.60 → 3037.58] had no sin
[3037.58 → 3039.38] if ever
[3039.38 → 3039.80] there was
[3039.80 → 3040.16] someone
[3040.16 → 3040.84] who didn't
[3040.84 → 3041.20] deserve
[3041.20 → 3041.98] to be
[3041.98 → 3042.44] abandoned
[3042.44 → 3043.00] it's him
[3043.00 → 3044.26] if ever
[3044.26 → 3044.80] there's someone
[3044.80 → 3045.32] who didn't
[3045.32 → 3045.68] deserve
[3045.68 → 3046.28] to feel
[3046.28 → 3047.16] alienation
[3047.16 → 3048.06] it's Jesus
[3048.06 → 3049.10] and yet
[3049.10 → 3049.72] in that
[3049.72 → 3050.14] moment
[3050.14 → 3051.08] he enters
[3051.08 → 3051.68] the hell
[3051.68 → 3052.66] of abandonment
[3052.66 → 3054.06] in that
[3054.06 → 3054.36] moment
[3054.36 → 3054.98] he enters
[3054.98 → 3055.88] the agony
[3055.88 → 3057.00] of alienation
[3057.00 → 3057.74] from his
[3057.74 → 3058.14] father
[3058.14 → 3059.14] this is
[3059.14 → 3059.66] the cup
[3059.66 → 3060.34] of God's
[3060.34 → 3060.66] wrath
[3060.66 → 3061.20] for sin
[3061.20 → 3061.82] he did
[3061.82 → 3062.52] not commit
[3062.52 → 3063.80] and he
[3063.80 → 3064.60] bore the curse
[3064.60 → 3065.44] by becoming
[3065.44 → 3066.02] cursed
[3066.02 → 3067.78] so by being
[3067.78 → 3068.46] cut off
[3068.46 → 3069.00] from the
[3069.00 → 3069.32] father
[3069.32 → 3070.02] he is
[3070.02 → 3070.82] experiencing
[3070.82 → 3072.18] unfathomable
[3072.18 → 3073.22] alienation
[3073.22 → 3074.02] and rejection
[3074.02 → 3075.14] and loneliness
[3075.14 → 3076.06] and he cries
[3076.06 → 3076.34] out
[3076.34 → 3076.92] my God
[3076.92 → 3077.60] my God
[3077.60 → 3078.22] why have
[3078.22 → 3079.22] you have forsaken
[3079.22 → 3079.50] me
[3079.50 → 3081.08] because that's
[3081.08 → 3081.80] the curse
[3081.80 → 3082.66] of sin
[3082.66 → 3084.16] sin
[3084.16 → 3084.58] in its
[3084.58 → 3085.50] most basic
[3085.50 → 3085.98] form
[3085.98 → 3087.62] is rejecting
[3087.62 → 3088.10] God
[3088.10 → 3088.82] it's removing
[3088.82 → 3089.40] ourselves
[3089.40 → 3090.02] from him
[3090.02 → 3090.76] that's what
[3090.76 → 3091.40] sin does
[3091.40 → 3092.18] and on the
[3092.18 → 3092.60] cross
[3092.60 → 3093.40] Jesus is
[3093.40 → 3094.10] experiencing
[3094.10 → 3094.74] the full
[3094.74 → 3095.22] effect
[3095.22 → 3095.98] of that
[3095.98 → 3096.60] reality
[3096.60 → 3097.98] it's as if
[3097.98 → 3098.54] God were
[3098.54 → 3098.90] saying
[3098.90 → 3099.88] this is what
[3099.88 → 3100.26] it looks
[3100.26 → 3100.56] like
[3100.56 → 3100.80] and what
[3100.80 → 3101.28] it feels
[3101.28 → 3101.58] like
[3101.58 → 3102.04] to have
[3102.04 → 3102.88] my presence
[3102.88 → 3103.32] to have
[3103.32 → 3104.04] my face
[3104.04 → 3104.92] turned away
[3104.92 → 3105.38] from you
[3105.38 → 3106.42] in choosing
[3106.42 → 3107.32] sin over
[3107.32 → 3107.80] me
[3107.80 → 3108.40] this is
[3108.40 → 3108.88] what you
[3108.88 → 3109.62] asked for
[3109.62 → 3112.06] on the
[3112.06 → 3112.46] cross
[3112.46 → 3114.32] Jesus
[3114.32 → 3114.84] God
[3114.84 → 3115.72] what we
[3115.72 → 3116.08] asked
[3116.08 → 3116.44] for
[3116.44 → 3117.94] what we
[3117.94 → 3118.42] deserved
[3118.42 → 3122.16] I love
[3122.16 → 3123.70] love the
[3123.70 → 3124.08] poetry
[3124.08 → 3124.52] again
[3124.52 → 3125.72] with which
[3125.72 → 3126.76] Brunei
[3126.76 → 3127.64] puts this
[3127.64 → 3128.04] he says
[3128.04 → 3129.14] Jesus
[3129.14 → 3129.98] drained
[3129.98 → 3130.78] the dregs
[3130.78 → 3131.10] of our
[3131.10 → 3131.44] cup
[3131.44 → 3132.42] and experienced
[3132.42 → 3132.86] hell
[3132.86 → 3134.62] in Jesus
[3134.62 → 3135.40] the sword
[3135.40 → 3135.92] went all
[3135.92 → 3136.28] the way
[3136.28 → 3136.82] into the
[3136.82 → 3137.16] sheath
[3137.16 → 3137.98] he came
[3137.98 → 3138.46] all the
[3138.46 → 3138.72] way
[3138.72 → 3139.14] into
[3139.14 → 3139.46] our
[3139.46 → 3139.86] human
[3139.86 → 3140.68] experience
[3140.68 → 3141.18] this
[3141.18 → 3141.54] is
[3141.54 → 3141.96] Jesus
[3141.96 → 3142.48] descent
[3142.48 → 3142.76] into
[3142.76 → 3143.06] hell
[3143.06 → 3144.08] and we
[3144.08 → 3144.24] should
[3144.24 → 3144.64] simply
[3144.64 → 3145.16] stand
[3145.16 → 3145.54] back
[3145.54 → 3145.82] in
[3145.82 → 3146.48] silence
[3146.48 → 3146.86] before
[3146.86 → 3147.16] the
[3147.16 → 3147.58] awful
[3147.58 → 3148.00] verb
[3148.00 → 3148.46] and
[3148.46 → 3148.90] wonder
[3148.90 → 3149.76] what
[3149.76 → 3149.88] it
[3149.88 → 3150.28] means
[3150.28 → 3153.48] my
[3153.48 → 3153.92] God
[3153.92 → 3154.72] my
[3154.72 → 3155.18] God
[3155.18 → 3156.26] why
[3156.26 → 3156.62] have
[3156.62 → 3156.98] you
[3156.98 → 3158.34] forsaken
[3158.34 → 3158.70] me
[3158.70 → 3162.98] it's
[3162.98 → 3163.32] Friday
[3163.32 → 3167.26] and I
[3167.26 → 3167.62] really
[3167.62 → 3167.96] hope
[3167.96 → 3168.30] Sunday
[3168.30 → 3168.46] is
[3168.46 → 3168.76] coming
[3168.76 → 3173.02] some
[3173.02 → 3173.30] of those
[3173.30 → 3173.62] people
[3173.62 → 3173.96] who are
[3173.96 → 3174.30] gathered
[3174.30 → 3174.76] around
[3174.76 → 3174.98] the
[3174.98 → 3175.46] cross
[3175.46 → 3176.04] they
[3176.04 → 3176.34] hear
[3176.34 → 3176.78] Jesus
[3176.78 → 3177.20] cry
[3177.20 → 3177.64] out
[3177.64 → 3178.06] Eli
[3178.06 → 3178.56] Eli
[3178.56 → 3179.18] and they
[3179.18 → 3179.70] think
[3179.70 → 3180.26] he's
[3180.26 → 3180.60] calling
[3180.60 → 3180.88] to
[3180.88 → 3181.32] Elijah
[3181.32 → 3182.46] and
[3182.46 → 3182.76] maybe
[3182.76 → 3183.30] because
[3183.30 → 3183.78] in that
[3183.78 → 3184.38] guttural
[3184.38 → 3184.96] scream
[3184.96 → 3185.18] of
[3185.18 → 3185.50] Eli
[3185.50 → 3185.82] Eli
[3185.82 → 3186.18] it
[3186.18 → 3186.56] sounds
[3186.56 → 3186.90] like
[3186.90 → 3187.48] Elijah
[3187.48 → 3188.18] Elijah
[3188.18 → 3188.96] and
[3188.96 → 3189.42] the
[3189.42 → 3189.78] people
[3189.78 → 3190.28] turn
[3190.28 → 3190.72] this
[3190.72 → 3191.18] into
[3191.18 → 3191.64] another
[3191.64 → 3192.12] chance
[3192.12 → 3192.34] to
[3192.34 → 3192.88] scoff
[3192.88 → 3193.50] at
[3193.50 → 3194.08] Jesus
[3194.08 → 3195.40] because
[3195.40 → 3196.20] in
[3196.20 → 3196.50] the
[3196.50 → 3196.86] last
[3196.86 → 3197.26] words
[3197.26 → 3197.54] of the
[3197.54 → 3197.84] Hebrew
[3197.84 → 3198.20] Bible
[3198.20 → 3198.46] in
[3198.46 → 3198.62] the
[3198.62 → 3200.18] book
[3200.18 → 3200.46] of
[3200.46 → 3200.94] Malachi
[3200.94 → 3202.38] we
[3202.38 → 3202.80] read
[3202.80 → 3204.32] see
[3204.32 → 3205.02] I
[3205.02 → 3205.22] will
[3205.22 → 3205.58] send
[3205.58 → 3205.80] the
[3205.80 → 3206.16] prophet
[3206.16 → 3206.70] Elijah
[3206.70 → 3206.96] to
[3206.96 → 3207.20] you
[3207.20 → 3207.62] before
[3207.62 → 3207.88] the
[3207.88 → 3208.24] great
[3208.24 → 3208.56] and
[3208.56 → 3209.00] dreadful
[3209.00 → 3209.36] day
[3209.36 → 3209.88] of
[3209.88 → 3210.04] the
[3210.04 → 3210.24] Lord
[3210.24 → 3210.74] comes
[3210.74 → 3212.20] and
[3212.20 → 3212.42] so
[3212.42 → 3212.66] the
[3212.66 → 3212.94] people
[3212.94 → 3213.28] took
[3213.28 → 3213.64] that
[3213.64 → 3213.88] and
[3213.88 → 3214.84] they
[3214.84 → 3215.56] began
[3215.56 → 3216.02] to
[3216.02 → 3216.80] use
[3216.80 → 3217.20] this
[3217.20 → 3217.68] as a
[3217.68 → 3218.00] marker
[3218.00 → 3218.38] of
[3218.38 → 3218.58] the
[3218.58 → 3218.96] Messiah
[3218.96 → 3219.22] who
[3219.22 → 3219.50] would
[3219.50 → 3219.90] come
[3219.90 → 3220.04] and
[3220.04 → 3220.14] they
[3220.14 → 3220.26] would
[3220.26 → 3220.40] say
[3220.40 → 3220.56] that
[3220.56 → 3221.02] Elijah
[3221.02 → 3221.50] would
[3221.50 → 3222.16] reappear
[3222.16 → 3222.78] before
[3222.78 → 3223.34] the
[3223.34 → 3223.70] Messiah
[3223.70 → 3224.22] appears
[3224.22 → 3224.62] and
[3224.62 → 3224.80] so
[3224.80 → 3225.00] they
[3225.00 → 3225.40] mock
[3225.40 → 3225.98] Jesus
[3225.98 → 3226.44] right
[3226.44 → 3226.90] they add
[3226.90 → 3227.44] to his
[3227.44 → 3227.98] shame
[3227.98 → 3228.28] and they
[3228.28 → 3228.40] say
[3228.40 → 3228.88] leave him
[3228.88 → 3229.18] alone
[3229.18 → 3229.56] let's
[3229.56 → 3230.02] see if
[3230.02 → 3230.52] Elijah
[3230.52 → 3231.22] comes
[3231.22 → 3231.68] to save
[3231.68 → 3231.78] him
[3231.78 → 3232.30] he thinks
[3232.30 → 3232.52] he's
[3232.52 → 3232.68] the
[3232.68 → 3233.08] Messiah
[3233.08 → 3233.60] they
[3233.60 → 3234.04] scorn
[3234.04 → 3234.52] and they
[3234.52 → 3234.88] scoff
[3234.88 → 3235.20] at him
[3235.20 → 3236.06] leave him
[3236.06 → 3236.60] than in
[3236.60 → 3236.84] that
[3236.84 → 3237.32] delusion
[3237.32 → 3239.52] now of
[3239.52 → 3239.80] course
[3239.80 → 3240.58] most of
[3240.58 → 3240.76] these
[3240.76 → 3241.22] people
[3241.22 → 3242.00] missed the
[3242.00 → 3242.88] transfiguration
[3242.88 → 3243.30] right
[3243.30 → 3243.88] where Moses
[3243.88 → 3244.44] and
[3244.44 → 3245.40] Elijah
[3245.40 → 3246.16] did
[3246.16 → 3246.62] appear
[3246.62 → 3247.42] with him
[3247.42 → 3248.80] most of
[3248.80 → 3249.02] these
[3249.02 → 3249.44] people
[3249.44 → 3250.10] hadn't yet
[3250.10 → 3250.44] made the
[3250.44 → 3250.82] connection
[3250.82 → 3251.36] that John
[3251.36 → 3251.80] the Baptist
[3251.80 → 3252.54] comes as a
[3252.54 → 3252.80] prophet
[3252.80 → 3253.58] like Messiah
[3253.58 → 3254.62] to announce
[3254.62 → 3255.50] behold the
[3255.50 → 3256.04] Lamb of
[3256.04 → 3256.36] God
[3256.36 → 3256.90] who takes
[3256.90 → 3257.28] away
[3257.28 → 3257.90] the sin
[3257.90 → 3258.16] of the
[3258.16 → 3258.46] world
[3258.46 → 3260.16] instead
[3260.16 → 3261.86] they continue
[3261.86 → 3262.46] his
[3262.46 → 3263.98] humiliation
[3263.98 → 3265.86] adding
[3265.86 → 3266.50] to the
[3266.50 → 3266.86] depth
[3266.86 → 3268.28] of his
[3268.28 → 3268.60] shame
[3268.60 → 3271.94] they missed
[3271.94 → 3273.68] the spiritual
[3273.68 → 3274.92] reality
[3274.92 → 3275.68] happening
[3275.68 → 3276.76] for them
[3276.76 → 3277.50] because
[3277.50 → 3278.28] they were
[3278.28 → 3278.96] fixated
[3278.96 → 3279.52] on the
[3279.52 → 3280.00] physical
[3280.00 → 3280.84] reality
[3280.84 → 3281.30] happening
[3281.30 → 3281.84] in front
[3281.84 → 3282.30] of them
[3282.30 → 3284.28] let me
[3284.28 → 3284.56] say that
[3284.56 → 3284.76] again
[3284.76 → 3285.52] they missed
[3285.52 → 3285.76] the
[3285.76 → 3286.16] spiritual
[3286.16 → 3286.72] reality
[3286.72 → 3287.12] happening
[3287.12 → 3287.80] for them
[3287.80 → 3288.14] on the
[3288.14 → 3288.46] cross
[3288.46 → 3288.72] because
[3288.72 → 3289.08] they were
[3289.08 → 3289.60] fixated
[3289.60 → 3290.18] on the
[3290.18 → 3290.54] physical
[3290.54 → 3291.04] reality
[3291.04 → 3291.62] happening
[3291.62 → 3292.10] in front
[3292.10 → 3292.48] of them
[3292.48 → 3294.02] and how
[3294.02 → 3294.50] many times
[3294.50 → 3294.70] are we
[3294.70 → 3295.02] not the
[3295.02 → 3295.22] same
[3295.22 → 3296.78] right
[3296.78 → 3297.28] how often
[3297.28 → 3297.58] are we
[3297.58 → 3297.94] blind
[3297.94 → 3298.48] or closed
[3298.48 → 3298.92] off to
[3298.92 → 3299.12] the
[3299.12 → 3299.46] spiritual
[3299.46 → 3300.02] reality
[3300.02 → 3300.56] of our
[3300.56 → 3301.08] circumstances
[3301.08 → 3301.40] because
[3301.40 → 3301.66] we're
[3301.66 → 3302.14] fixated
[3302.14 → 3302.48] on the
[3302.48 → 3302.86] physical
[3302.86 → 3303.44] reality
[3303.44 → 3304.14] in front
[3304.14 → 3304.40] of us
[3304.40 → 3304.56] right
[3304.56 → 3304.70] when
[3304.70 → 3305.38] feelings
[3305.38 → 3306.02] of pain
[3306.02 → 3306.48] blind
[3306.48 → 3306.74] us
[3306.74 → 3307.04] to the
[3307.04 → 3307.38] truth
[3307.38 → 3307.82] of
[3307.82 → 3308.24] doctrine
[3308.24 → 3308.66] when
[3308.66 → 3308.90] the
[3308.90 → 3309.40] feelings
[3309.40 → 3309.92] of hurt
[3309.92 → 3310.84] overwhelm
[3310.84 → 3311.18] what we
[3311.18 → 3311.48] know
[3311.48 → 3311.84] to be
[3311.84 → 3312.16] true
[3312.16 → 3312.60] when
[3312.60 → 3313.02] the
[3313.02 → 3313.46] hardships
[3313.46 → 3313.76] we
[3313.76 → 3314.24] experience
[3314.24 → 3314.54] whatever
[3314.54 → 3314.98] they may
[3314.98 → 3315.24] be
[3315.24 → 3316.00] cut us
[3316.00 → 3316.36] off
[3316.36 → 3316.54] from
[3316.54 → 3316.70] the
[3316.70 → 3316.94] hope
[3316.94 → 3317.44] of
[3317.44 → 3317.86] comfort
[3317.86 → 3319.18] and
[3319.18 → 3319.32] for
[3319.32 → 3319.62] just
[3319.62 → 3319.80] a
[3319.80 → 3320.10] moment
[3320.10 → 3320.46] right
[3320.46 → 3320.78] now
[3320.78 → 3321.24] you
[3321.24 → 3321.54] are
[3321.54 → 3321.84] being
[3321.84 → 3322.30] invited
[3322.30 → 3322.54] to
[3322.54 → 3322.82] see
[3322.82 → 3323.08] the
[3323.08 → 3323.54] world
[3323.54 → 3324.10] not

[3325.02 → 3325.24] of
[3325.24 → 3325.48] these
[3325.48 → 3325.94] physical
[3325.94 → 3326.52] realities
[3326.52 → 3327.08] but

[3332.90 → 3333.06] be
[3333.06 → 3333.58] really
[3333.58 → 3333.98] clear
[3333.98 → 3335.70] this
[3335.70 → 3335.86] is
[3335.86 → 3336.06] not
[3336.06 → 3336.24] an

[3439.54 → 3441.68] this
[3441.68 → 3441.96] may

[3444.32 → 3445.82] right
[3445.82 → 3446.28] you
[3446.28 → 3447.24] might

[3494.46 → 3499.64] don't
[3499.64 → 3499.90] miss
[3499.90 → 3500.30] what so
[3500.30 → 3500.50] many
[3500.50 → 3500.82] people
[3500.82 → 3501.22] have
[3501.22 → 3502.22] love
[3502.22 → 3504.22] in
[3504.22 → 3504.28] the
[3504.28 → 3504.58] story
[3504.58 → 3504.74] that
[3504.74 → 3504.88] we
[3504.88 → 3505.02] are
[3505.02 → 3505.40] reading
[3505.40 → 3506.48] that
[3506.48 → 3506.58] we
[3506.58 → 3506.70] are
[3506.70 → 3507.30] rehearsing
[3507.30 → 3508.44] there's
[3508.44 → 3508.68] one
[3508.68 → 3509.08] man
[3509.08 → 3509.56] in a
[3509.56 → 3509.80] group
[3509.80 → 3510.14] with
[3510.14 → 3510.42] him
[3510.42 → 3511.04] who
[3511.04 → 3511.50] saw
[3511.50 → 3512.00] Jesus
[3512.00 → 3512.38] who
[3512.38 → 3512.78] saw
[3512.78 → 3513.40] all
[3513.40 → 3513.60] that
[3513.60 → 3513.80] has
[3513.80 → 3514.26] happened
[3514.26 → 3515.72] and
[3515.72 → 3515.92] made
[3515.92 → 3516.24] sense
[3516.24 → 3516.40] of
[3516.40 → 3516.58] it
[3516.58 → 3517.52] and
[3517.52 → 3517.68] it's
[3517.68 → 3517.80] a
[3517.80 → 3518.06] Roman
[3518.06 → 3518.88] centurion
[3518.88 → 3519.76] and
[3519.76 → 3519.98] those
[3519.98 → 3520.20] with
[3520.20 → 3520.42] him
[3520.42 → 3522.18] it's
[3522.18 → 3522.30] not
[3522.30 → 3522.44] the
[3522.44 → 3522.86] disciples
[3522.86 → 3523.72] we
[3523.72 → 3523.84] have
[3523.84 → 3523.98] no
[3523.98 → 3524.22] idea
[3524.22 → 3524.38] where
[3524.38 → 3524.52] they
[3524.52 → 3524.76] are
[3524.76 → 3526.00] it's
[3526.00 → 3526.12] not
[3526.12 → 3526.26] the
[3526.26 → 3526.58] religious
[3526.58 → 3527.12] officials
[3527.12 → 3528.00] it's
[3528.00 → 3528.12] not
[3528.12 → 3528.28] the
[3528.28 → 3528.70] crowds
[3528.70 → 3528.90] who
[3528.90 → 3529.12] just
[3529.12 → 3529.24] a
[3529.24 → 3529.40] week
[3529.40 → 3529.64] ago
[3529.64 → 3530.02] cheered
[3530.02 → 3530.24] him
[3530.24 → 3530.56] into
[3530.56 → 3531.10] Jerusalem
[3531.10 → 3531.58] it
[3531.58 → 3531.70] is
[3531.70 → 3531.88] a
[3531.88 → 3532.12] Roman
[3532.12 → 3532.60] soldier
[3532.60 → 3532.88] who
[3532.88 → 3533.20] says
[3533.20 → 3533.84] surely
[3533.84 → 3534.90] he
[3534.90 → 3535.68] was
[3535.68 → 3535.84] the
[3535.84 → 3536.14] son
[3536.14 → 3536.98] of
[3536.98 → 3537.38] God
[3537.38 → 3540.28] John
[3540.28 → 3540.64] Calvin
[3540.64 → 3541.08] in his
[3541.08 → 3541.44] commentary
[3541.44 → 3542.36] on this
[3542.36 → 3542.76] story
[3542.76 → 3543.00] he
[3543.00 → 3543.42] says
[3543.42 → 3544.98] it
[3544.98 → 3545.16] is
[3545.16 → 3546.00] wonderful
[3546.00 → 3546.74] that
[3546.74 → 3546.92] an
[3546.92 → 3547.64] irreligious
[3547.64 → 3548.12] man
[3548.12 → 3548.52] who
[3548.52 → 3548.66] has
[3548.66 → 3548.90] not
[3548.90 → 3549.06] been
[3549.06 → 3549.44] instructed
[3549.44 → 3549.66] in
[3549.66 → 3549.76] the
[3549.76 → 3550.04] law
[3550.04 → 3550.48] and
[3550.48 → 3550.66] was
[3550.66 → 3551.00] ignorant
[3551.00 → 3551.24] of
[3551.24 → 3551.46] true
[3551.46 → 3551.86] religion
[3551.86 → 3552.24] should
[3552.24 → 3552.68] form
[3552.68 → 3553.06] so
[3553.06 → 3553.66] correct
[3553.66 → 3553.96] a
[3553.96 → 3554.30] judgment
[3554.30 → 3554.62] from
[3554.62 → 3554.80] the
[3554.80 → 3555.24] signs
[3555.24 → 3555.52] which
[3555.52 → 3555.70] he
[3555.70 → 3556.10] beheld
[3556.10 → 3557.36] and
[3557.36 → 3557.60] Calvin
[3557.60 → 3557.82] goes
[3557.82 → 3558.06] on
[3558.06 → 3558.22] to
[3558.22 → 3558.62] contrast
[3558.62 → 3559.16] that
[3559.16 → 3559.56] with
[3559.56 → 3559.74] the
[3559.74 → 3560.14] shocking
[3560.14 → 3560.72] madness
[3560.72 → 3561.06] and
[3561.06 → 3561.20] the
[3561.20 → 3561.48] gross
[3561.48 → 3562.08] blindness
[3562.08 → 3562.46] and
[3562.46 → 3562.64] the
[3562.64 → 3563.36] condemnable
[3563.36 → 3564.48] stupidity
[3564.48 → 3565.18] that's
[3565.18 → 3565.36] his
[3565.36 → 3565.64] word
[3565.64 → 3566.12] of
[3566.12 → 3566.30] the
[3566.30 → 3566.64] people
[3566.64 → 3566.92] who
[3566.92 → 3567.18] should
[3567.18 → 3567.34] have
[3567.34 → 3567.56] known
[3567.56 → 3567.86] better
[3567.86 → 3569.90] now
[3569.90 → 3570.38] I
[3570.38 → 3570.52] don't
[3570.52 → 3570.74] think
[3570.74 → 3570.94] any
[3570.94 → 3571.10] of
[3571.10 → 3571.22] you
[3571.22 → 3571.38] are
[3571.38 → 3571.80] stupid
[3571.80 → 3572.94] or
[3572.94 → 3573.38] blind
[3573.38 → 3574.18] or
[3574.18 → 3574.56] mad
[3574.56 → 3575.64] or
[3575.64 → 3575.76] if
[3575.76 → 3575.88] I
[3575.88 → 3576.00] do
[3576.00 → 3576.12] I
[3576.12 → 3576.30] wouldn't
[3576.30 → 3576.50] tell
[3576.50 → 3576.74] you
[3576.74 → 3577.74] at
[3577.74 → 3577.86] least
[3577.86 → 3578.04] not
[3578.04 → 3578.16] in
[3578.16 → 3578.32] this
[3578.32 → 3578.60] setting
[3578.60 → 3580.60] but
[3580.60 → 3580.72] I
[3580.72 → 3581.00] really
[3581.00 → 3581.20] do
[3581.20 → 3581.58] believe
[3581.58 → 3581.82] that
[3581.82 → 3582.08] leaves
[3582.08 → 3582.32] us
[3582.32 → 3582.64] without
[3582.64 → 3583.30] excuse
[3583.30 → 3585.32] in
[3585.32 → 3585.46] the
[3585.46 → 3585.74] story
[3585.74 → 3585.94] the
[3585.94 → 3586.28] temple
[3586.28 → 3586.72] curtain
[3586.72 → 3587.02] is
[3587.02 → 3587.40] torn
[3587.40 → 3587.74] in
[3587.74 → 3588.08] two
[3588.08 → 3588.68] when
[3588.68 → 3589.08] Jesus
[3589.08 → 3589.72] breathes
[3589.72 → 3589.94] his
[3589.94 → 3590.38] last
[3590.38 → 3590.96] one
[3590.96 → 3591.56] final
[3591.56 → 3592.24] sacrifice
[3592.24 → 3592.66] once
[3592.66 → 3592.90] for
[3592.90 → 3593.18] all
[3593.18 → 3593.44] has
[3593.44 → 3594.60] ended
[3594.60 → 3595.00] the
[3595.00 → 3595.30] need
[3595.30 → 3595.52] for
[3595.52 → 3595.78] all
[3595.78 → 3596.50] sacrifices
[3596.50 → 3597.50] and
[3597.50 → 3598.02] also
[3598.02 → 3598.38] has
[3598.38 → 3598.88] opened
[3598.88 → 3599.24] up
[3599.24 → 3599.52] to
[3599.52 → 3599.94] us
[3599.94 → 3600.42] the
[3600.42 → 3600.80] way
[3600.80 → 3601.30] into
[3601.30 → 3601.56] the
[3601.56 → 3601.88] presence
[3601.88 → 3602.08] of
[3602.08 → 3602.28] God
[3602.28 → 3602.68] quite

[3646.28 → 3646.50] many
[3646.50 → 3646.94] people

[3657.32 → 3658.46] clarifies
[3658.46 → 3658.66] for
[3658.66 → 3658.86] us
[3658.86 → 3659.02] that

[3662.64 → 3663.30] is
[3663.30 → 3663.54] very
[3663.54 → 3664.62] particularly
[3664.62 → 3665.34] making
[3665.34 → 3666.00] a point
[3666.00 → 3666.46] that
[3666.46 → 3667.28] the parallels
[3667.28 → 3667.78] a point

[3670.62 → 3671.30] verse 20
[3671.30 → 3671.72] when he

[3672.04 → 3672.48] Jesus
[3672.48 → 3672.86] the

[3677.44 → 3677.72] to be
[3677.72 → 3678.00] made
[3678.00 → 3678.18] are
[3678.18 → 3678.52] connected
[3678.52 → 3678.76] back
[3678.76 → 3679.08] to a
[3679.08 → 3679.48] prophecy
[3679.48 → 3679.90] that's
[3679.90 → 3680.22] spoken
[3680.22 → 3680.56] about
[3680.56 → 3680.72] the

[3682.52 → 3683.08] verse 2
[3683.08 → 3683.80] it says
[3683.80 → 3684.38] multitudes
[3684.38 → 3684.94] who sleep
[3684.94 → 3685.20] in the
[3685.20 → 3685.42] dust
[3685.42 → 3685.66] of the
[3685.66 → 3685.86] earth
[3685.86 → 3686.06] will
[3686.06 → 3686.42] awake
[3686.42 → 3687.40] but
[3687.40 → 3687.58] in
[3687.58 → 3687.92] short
[3687.92 → 3688.60] the point
[3688.60 → 3688.80] that's
[3688.80 → 3689.04] being
[3689.04 → 3689.32] made
[3689.32 → 3689.66] here
[3689.66 → 3690.38] is
[3690.38 → 3690.52] that
[3690.52 → 3690.78] yes
[3690.78 → 3691.06] it's
[3691.06 → 3691.46] Friday
[3691.46 → 3694.58] Sunday's
[3694.58 → 3694.96] coming
[3694.96 → 3696.46] you're
[3696.46 → 3696.62] getting
[3696.62 → 3696.80] it
[3696.80 → 3697.24] slowly
[3697.24 → 3700.40] Isaiah
[3700.40 → 3700.94] 53
[3700.94 → 3702.12] says
[3702.12 → 3702.52] he was
[3702.52 → 3703.28] despised
[3703.28 → 3704.02] and rejected
[3704.02 → 3704.82] by mankind
[3704.82 → 3705.50] a man
[3705.50 → 3706.46] of suffering
[3706.46 → 3707.04] and familiar
[3707.04 → 3707.62] with pain
[3707.62 → 3708.30] like one
[3708.30 → 3708.70] from whom
[3708.70 → 3709.02] people
[3709.02 → 3710.04] hide their
[3710.04 → 3710.46] faces
[3710.46 → 3710.92] he was
[3710.92 → 3711.64] despised
[3711.64 → 3712.28] and we
[3712.28 → 3712.80] held him
[3712.80 → 3713.24] in low
[3713.24 → 3713.82] esteem
[3713.82 → 3714.82] surely
[3714.82 → 3715.62] remember that
[3715.62 → 3715.90] word
[3715.90 → 3716.46] surely
[3716.46 → 3717.32] he took
[3717.32 → 3717.82] up our
[3717.82 → 3718.24] pain
[3718.24 → 3718.72] and bore
[3718.72 → 3718.94] our
[3718.94 → 3719.46] suffering
[3719.46 → 3720.12] yet we
[3720.12 → 3720.58] considered
[3720.58 → 3720.86] him
[3720.86 → 3721.30] punished
[3721.30 → 3721.92] by God
[3721.92 → 3722.36] stricken
[3722.36 → 3722.82] by him
[3722.82 → 3723.54] and afflicted
[3723.54 → 3724.22] he was
[3724.22 → 3724.80] pierced
[3724.80 → 3725.34] for our
[3725.34 → 3726.18] transgressions
[3726.18 → 3726.54] he was
[3726.54 → 3726.96] crushed
[3726.96 → 3727.74] for our
[3727.74 → 3728.36] iniquities
[3728.36 → 3728.74] and the
[3728.74 → 3729.12] punishment
[3729.12 → 3729.62] that brought
[3729.62 → 3730.34] us peace
[3730.34 → 3731.10] was on
[3731.10 → 3731.38] him
[3731.38 → 3732.46] by his
[3732.46 → 3733.14] wounds
[3733.14 → 3733.90] we
[3733.90 → 3734.76] are
[3734.76 → 3735.66] healed
[3735.66 → 3737.80] the
[3737.80 → 3738.28] centurion
[3738.28 → 3738.56] said
[3738.56 → 3739.08] surely
[3739.08 → 3740.04] this man
[3740.04 → 3740.56] was the
[3740.56 → 3740.88] son
[3740.88 → 3741.84] of God
[3741.84 → 3742.44] surely
[3742.44 → 3743.28] he is
[3743.28 → 3744.18] the son
[3744.18 → 3744.92] of
[3744.92 → 3745.74] God
[3745.74 → 3746.56] God
[3746.56 → 3747.12] is
[3747.12 → 3747.86] dead
[3747.86 → 3749.88] he
[3749.88 → 3750.18] saw
[3750.18 → 3750.88] it
[3750.88 → 3752.82] do you
[3752.82 → 3756.40] surely
[3756.40 → 3756.94] he
[3756.94 → 3757.32] took
[3757.32 → 3757.80] up
[3757.80 → 3758.56] our
[3758.56 → 3759.22] pain
[3759.22 → 3760.06] surely
[3760.06 → 3760.42] he
[3760.42 → 3760.82] bore
[3760.82 → 3761.22] our
[3761.22 → 3761.82] suffering
[3761.82 → 3762.26] surely
[3762.26 → 3762.58] he
[3762.58 → 3762.80] was
[3762.80 → 3763.20] pierced
[3763.20 → 3763.86] for our
[3763.86 → 3764.66] transgressions
[3764.66 → 3765.02] crushed
[3765.02 → 3765.62] for our
[3765.62 → 3766.38] iniquities
[3766.38 → 3766.92] surely
[3766.92 → 3767.84] by his
[3767.84 → 3768.36] wounds
[3768.36 → 3769.02] we
[3769.02 → 3769.42] are
[3769.42 → 3769.80] healed
[3769.80 → 3770.50] God
[3770.50 → 3770.94] is
[3770.94 → 3771.54] dead
[3771.54 → 3773.24] and
[3773.24 → 3773.64] we
[3773.64 → 3774.76] have
[3774.76 → 3775.04] killed
[3775.04 → 3775.36] him
[3775.36 → 3780.82] earlier
[3780.82 → 3782.84] quoting
[3782.84 → 3783.40] Brunei
[3783.40 → 3783.96] I said
[3783.96 → 3784.30] that we
[3784.30 → 3784.52] should
[3784.52 → 3784.96] simply
[3784.96 → 3785.50] stand
[3785.50 → 3785.94] back
[3785.94 → 3786.28] in
[3786.28 → 3786.78] silence
[3786.78 → 3787.16] before
[3787.16 → 3787.62] the
[3787.62 → 3788.04] awful
[3788.04 → 3788.52] verb
[3788.52 → 3788.80] and
[3788.80 → 3789.24] wonder
[3789.24 → 3789.60] what
[3789.60 → 3789.76] it
[3789.76 → 3790.20] means
[3790.20 → 3792.38] we've
[3792.38 → 3792.52] looked
[3792.52 → 3792.88] at some
[3792.88 → 3793.20] of those
[3793.20 → 3793.62] meanings
[3793.62 → 3794.74] tonight
[3794.74 → 3795.70] we've
[3795.70 → 3795.86] only
[3795.86 → 3796.18] scratched
[3796.18 → 3796.38] the
[3796.38 → 3796.68] surface
[3796.68 → 3796.94] on
[3796.94 → 3797.30] most
[3797.30 → 3797.46] of
[3797.46 → 3797.66] them
[3797.66 → 3797.88] and
[3797.88 → 3798.84] we've
[3798.84 → 3799.06] left
[3799.06 → 3799.36] many
[3799.36 → 3799.62] for
[3799.62 → 3799.80] your
[3799.80 → 3800.10] own
[3800.10 → 3800.78] reflection
[3800.78 → 3803.04] but
[3803.04 → 3803.20] we're
[3803.20 → 3803.38] going
[3803.38 → 3803.56] to
[3803.56 → 3804.00] end
[3804.00 → 3806.90] we're
[3806.90 → 3807.04] going
[3807.04 → 3807.22] to
[3807.22 → 3807.52] end
[3807.52 → 3808.10] in
[3808.10 → 3808.54] this
[3808.54 → 3809.08] moment
[3809.08 → 3809.38] of
[3809.38 → 3810.00] silence
[3810.00 → 3811.08] and
[3811.08 → 3811.46] song
[3811.46 → 3812.38] in
[3812.38 → 3812.52] just
[3812.52 → 3812.64] a
[3812.64 → 3812.84] moment
