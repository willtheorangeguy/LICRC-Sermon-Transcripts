[0.00 → 8.18] Welcome to church this morning. A special welcome if you are a guest with us this morning. We're
[8.18 → 16.50] super excited to have you worship with us on this first Sunday of Advent where we jump into the
[16.50 → 24.06] season of waiting and anticipating Christmas as well on this Sunday as we baptize Lucas Said.
[24.30 → 29.04] And so if you're here for that this morning, a special welcome to you as well. My name is Chris.
[29.04 → 33.92] I'm one of the pastors here at Emanuel, and it's my privilege to lead in our worship this morning
[33.92 → 39.48] along with these others and a few who will come up later. Before we begin, we have just a couple
[39.48 → 47.16] announcements to run through, and I'm going to try to do them in order of when they happen so that we
[47.16 → 56.84] can follow along. So today after church, youth coffee is happening and so if you are a youth,
[56.84 → 62.66] you go to someone from church's house and have coffee and lunch and hang out there. Today,
[62.80 → 68.00] that's at my house. So if you need to know where that is, talk to me or to my wife or any of my
[68.00 → 72.64] family, and they'll tell you how to get there. Sometime after church, head over that way and
[72.64 → 82.44] we'll happily hang out and feed you there. This evening at 5 p.m., we're hosting the TRI Soup
[82.44 → 89.88] Tournament in advance of our annual general meeting. And so the TRI Soup Tournament is an
[89.88 → 95.52] opportunity for you if you're a member here to make your best soup and to bring it and then we
[95.52 → 101.38] will all try the soup. Now you see where the name comes from. And then vote on our favourites, and we'll
[101.38 → 109.14] crown a king or queen at the end of the evening together. That begins at 5 p.m.
[109.14 → 116.30] And our annual general meeting begins at 6 p.m. And so if you are a member here over 18,
[116.74 → 122.84] we ask that you'd come and join us tonight so that we can see what God has been doing in our midst and
[122.84 → 129.06] look forward to what he will do in the next ministry year as we present a budget to you.
[130.68 → 137.30] Keeping moving through the calendar, on Thursday, December 4, Christianity Explored class
[137.30 → 143.36] is meeting again. Please note that's Wednesday this time, not Thursday. We're trying the Wednesday
[143.36 → 150.64] shift, and so we meet at 6 p.m. for dinner and 6 30 we start in our work together. So if you've been
[150.64 → 153.78] attending that or if you're interested in that, talk to me, but I'll see you on Wednesday.
[156.60 → 164.72] December 8th, no sorry, December 7, youth, you have your Christmas party and Christmas competition.
[164.72 → 170.80] I trust you know what that's about because Kevin didn't give me any details, but that's December 7
[170.80 → 179.88] from 5 to 9 here at the church as well. And December 8th, HCBC and the Heidelberg Catechism
[179.88 → 185.50] Adult Education Group is meeting that evening. And so talk to me about that. And lastly,
[186.22 → 192.22] and I forgot to bring up my card, but lastly, on December 15, which is two weeks from today,
[192.22 → 200.64] we are hosting an event that we're calling O Come Emmanuel. And it's a Christmas Eve carol and
[200.64 → 208.24] Christmas hymns evening together where we will start at 6 p.m. We'll sing all of your favourite
[208.24 → 213.74] Christmas carols and songs, and then we'll have some time afterwards with some Christmas treats and hot
[213.74 → 220.66] chocolate and goodies and the like. And so we want you to join us for that on December 15 at 6 p.m.
[220.66 → 225.40] But also, this is a great thing to invite your family or your friends, your neighbours or your
[225.40 → 230.18] co-workers to. And if that's something you're interested in doing, we have little postcards
[230.18 → 235.16] at the back for the event that say, O Come Emmanuel. And then on the back, it says,
[235.24 → 240.24] You're invited to and gives the details. At the Connect booth, you can grab one or two or four of
[240.24 → 246.74] those to share with your friends, neighbours, co-workers, classmates, whomever, invite them out for that
[246.74 → 257.30] evening. And then lastly, lastly, following our worship today, because we have the AGM this evening,
[257.60 → 262.52] it'd be really helpful if we could stack some chairs, move them to the side, if we could pull
[262.52 → 267.38] the tables out of the back and get that all set up. That way the council members don't have to show up
[267.38 → 271.78] here at four to do all of that work, but you can help them do that work in preparation.
[271.78 → 279.32] I think that's it for announcements this morning. Not quite. Oh, one more. Thank you. Thank you for
[279.32 → 286.38] reminding me. For December 15, we are looking for some readers for that service, particularly
[286.38 → 294.48] children, right? We want children who can do some reading for us. And if you are a capable reader,
[294.48 → 301.20] and if you consider yourself to be a child, I'll leave it at that, talk to Jackie. Jackie, where are you?
[302.72 → 309.86] Jackie? She's busy. Okay. Talk to Jackie, Hubert, or Sarah, or me, and we'll get you signed up
[309.86 → 316.18] for that. Am I done now, Sarah? Yes? Okay. Thank you. Oh, one more.
[316.18 → 324.68] Saturday, there's a worship service at Sun ridge Gardens. Ken, you failed. Where are you? That's
[324.68 → 331.12] normally your responsibility to tell me. On this coming Saturday at 2 p.m., there's a worship
[331.12 → 338.40] service. My goodness, we are busy people. 2 p.m. at Sun ridge Gardens up the hill, invite you to join
[338.40 → 346.96] with the residents there for worship. Anyone else? Oh, last Friday, there were a women's event here.
[347.48 → 351.98] Thank you to the organizers of that. There was over 130 people who came out to that evening,
[352.14 → 355.84] and I hear by all accounts, it was fantastic. So thank you for that.
[360.12 → 367.44] All right. I think I'm done now. We're going to stand together and be ushered into the presence of
[367.44 → 375.08] God in worship. So I invite you, as you are able, to stand and to take a posture of receipt, perhaps,
[375.22 → 382.32] in your heart, in your mind, even with your hands, and receive the greeting of our good God. Following
[382.32 → 387.68] the greeting that I offer you, I invite you to turn to those around you and to welcome them into our
[387.68 → 397.08] shared worship space this morning. Receive the greeting of our God. Grace, mercy, and peace to you.
[397.44 → 403.58] From God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, Son, and our Saviour, through the presence and power
[403.58 → 406.12] of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[427.44 → 437.18] I invite you all to be seated for the lighting of the Advent Candle.
[437.18 → 451.14] I invite you all to be seated for the lighting of the Advent Candle.
[451.14 → 460.88] Good morning.
[460.88 → 468.30] The prayers we use this Advent season have deep roots in the early Christian liturgical tradition,
[468.30 → 477.00] particularly the Gelatin Sacramental, a collection of prayers dating back to the 6th century.
[477.00 → 483.74] This ancient text shaped much of the Western Church's worship, including the Advent prayers we now use,
[483.74 → 491.24] reflecting themes of hope, peace, joy, and love as we await Christ's coming.
[493.24 → 502.76] The Gelatin Sacramental emphasizes the need for preparation, vigilance, and prayer as a church eagerly
[502.76 → 509.50] anticipates the arrival of the Saviour. These prayers are not just historical artifacts,
[509.50 → 518.50] but living expressions of the church's ongoing longing for Christ, guiding our worship in this sacred season.
[518.50 → 532.38] Advent begins with a call to hope as we prepare our hearts for Christ's coming. As we light the first candle,
[532.38 → 539.12] we remember the ancient longing of God's people for a Saviour. In a world that often feels dark,
[539.12 → 547.12] this light is a sign of the hope we have in Christ, who will come to fulfill the promises of Scripture.
[547.12 → 549.54] And here's the actual prayer.
[549.54 → 551.28] Advent reminds us of the Lord.
[551.28 → 558.24] Stir our hearts, O Lord, to prepare the way for your only Son, that we may serve you with purified minds.
[559.32 → 565.80] Advent reminds us to wait with eager expectation for the fulfillment of God's promises.
[565.80 → 579.54] Advent is a sign of the Lord.
[579.54 → 582.72] I invite you to stand now as we start our worship and sing.
[582.72 → 603.50] Advent is a sign of the Lord.
[603.50 → 616.56] Come, the long-expected Jesus, born to set thy people free.
[616.56 → 627.56] From our fears and sins release us, let us find our rest in thee.
[627.56 → 638.56] Through the strength and consolation, O the holy earth thou art.
[638.98 → 649.56] Dear desire of every nation, joy of every holy heart.
[649.56 → 661.48] Born a people to deliver, born a child yet a king.
[662.02 → 672.04] Born to reign in us forever, now thy gracious kingdom bring.
[672.04 → 684.04] By thy whole eternal spirit, ruling all our hearts alone.
[684.04 → 697.04] By thy all-sufficient land, praise us to thy glorious hope.
[697.04 → 719.04] For thy holy name is virgin.
[723.32 → 724.04] For thy holy name.
[724.04 → 731.56] For all new Lord, you are the source of heaven's own water.
[733.96 → 741.42] Jesus, life of the darkness, Jesus, truth in circumstance,
[741.42 → 748.34] you are the source of heaven's own water.
[748.34 → 758.16] In history, you're in the heart, you're all the change, you're all to life.
[758.58 → 766.00] You are the hope, you're leading us, you are the rush, you're building trust,
[766.00 → 772.78] you are the light, shining for all the world to see.
[772.78 → 779.80] You rose from the dead, conquering fear, our grace and peace,
[779.80 → 787.78] you're trying to steal, Jesus, our hope, living for all the world to see.
[787.78 → 791.40] Don't we believe?
[798.78 → 807.06] Jesus, hope of the nations, Jesus, comfort for all who be born,
[807.06 → 812.64] you are the source of heaven's own water.
[814.64 → 822.06] Jesus, life of the darkness, Jesus, truth in circumstance,
[822.06 → 828.06] you are the source of heaven's own water.
[828.06 → 838.06] You're mystery, you're in the heart, you're all the change, you're all to life.
[838.06 → 846.22] You are the hope, you're leading us, you are the rush, you're the trust,
[846.22 → 852.06] you are the light, shining for all the world to see.
[852.06 → 882.04] Lord, we believe.
[882.06 → 884.06] Lord, we believe.
[888.06 → 890.22] Feel free to take a seat or stay standing.
[890.76 → 891.98] I'm just going to read for a little bit.
[892.68 → 897.06] I'm going to share a story of my own life for our confession insurance today.
[898.34 → 902.16] You don't have to worry, it's not going to be as long as Pastor Chris's sermons.
[902.48 → 902.96] I promise.
[905.04 → 908.20] And I'm doing this in part because of the encouragement of my care group.
[908.20 → 911.64] So if you have any complaints, you can direct them to Perry.
[911.64 → 917.82] Jokes aside, the short of it is, I'm burnt out.
[918.64 → 919.86] What do I mean by that?
[920.64 → 924.44] I've been working and living far beyond my capacity for too long,
[924.84 → 927.78] and that is showing up in my physical, mental, and emotional health.
[927.78 → 935.04] But I think most importantly, my spiritual health is suffering because I have neglected my relationship with God.
[935.94 → 939.80] I've done all the things that a good Christian should do, whatever that means.
[939.80 → 947.08] But it's about my heart posture, which has led me to make choices that prevent me from resting in his presence,
[947.58 → 949.84] resulting in my current state.
[951.76 → 955.16] It's easy for me to blame that on my life situations.
[955.90 → 958.90] I do shift work and don't sleep that well all the time.
[959.58 → 962.04] The stress of being chronically short-staffed at work.
[962.58 → 965.06] The emotional toll of tough things going on in life.
[965.06 → 969.56] Not to minimize the impact of these things on me,
[970.24 → 973.64] but when life gets busy, what ends up shrinking in my schedule,
[974.12 → 977.72] if I'm being honest, is my quality heart-to-heart time with God.
[979.02 → 983.36] Bible reading and prayer become task-oriented and purely intellectual,
[983.88 → 988.18] rather than communing with my God and King, maker of heaven and earth.
[989.74 → 992.56] Christmas is a notorious time for people to be busy,
[993.16 → 994.52] and I am no exception.
[995.06 → 998.44] But as Christians, we are in the season of Advent.
[999.36 → 1004.12] Advent is a season of waiting, preparing for and anticipating the birth of Jesus.
[1005.80 → 1008.56] What would it look like if I took that seriously?
[1010.46 → 1012.64] This is my confession going into Advent.
[1013.78 → 1014.56] What's yours?
[1015.56 → 1017.00] What is your heart posture?
[1018.18 → 1019.46] Are you caught up in the chaos?
[1019.46 → 1024.92] Or are you calling on God to stir your heart and prepare for Jesus?
[1026.52 → 1028.92] We just sang about Jesus being our hope,
[1029.36 → 1034.28] and I know it's easy for me to lose sight of that in the midst of chaos and challenges in life.
[1035.04 → 1036.50] But God never lets go.
[1036.50 → 1040.88] Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
[1040.88 → 1043.62] His perfect love is casting out fear.
[1044.40 → 1047.72] And even when I'm caught in the middle of the storms of this life,
[1048.14 → 1049.16] I know God is near.
[1050.30 → 1052.62] Stand and join us in singing these truths together.
[1052.62 → 1056.56] I know God is near.
[1056.56 → 1057.98] Let's hear it.
[1057.98 → 1060.08] I know God is near.
[1060.24 → 1062.80] Let's hear it.
[1062.80 → 1063.84] I know.
[1064.00 → 1064.46] I know.
[1064.46 → 1066.04] I know.
[1066.04 → 1093.70] Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
[1093.70 → 1098.48] when the perfect love is casting out clear,
[1100.30 → 1106.74] and even when I'm caught in the middle of the storms of this life,
[1107.36 → 1111.66] I won't turn back, I know you are near.
[1111.66 → 1123.66] I will fear no evil, for my God is with you.
[1123.70 → 1130.70] I will fear no evil, for my God is with me.
[1130.70 → 1138.70] Whom then shall I fear? Whom then shall I fear?
[1138.70 → 1145.70] Oh no, you never let go, through the calling, through the storm.
[1145.70 → 1151.70] Oh no, you never let go, in every high and every low.
[1151.70 → 1158.70] Oh no, you never let go, Lord, you never let go of me.
[1158.70 → 1170.70] I can see the light that is coming, or the heart that holds on.
[1170.70 → 1175.70] What glorious might be, I'll no compare.
[1175.70 → 1182.70] There will be an end to the troubles, but until that day comes,
[1182.70 → 1194.70] will live to know the fear of the earth, and I will fear no evil.
[1194.70 → 1201.70] For my God is with me.
[1201.70 → 1207.70] And if my God is with me.
[1207.70 → 1214.70] Whom then shall I fear? Whom then shall I fear?
[1214.70 → 1216.70] Whom then shall I fear?
[1216.70 → 1221.70] Oh no, you never let go, through the calling, through the storm.
[1221.70 → 1227.70] Oh no, you never let go, in every high and every low.
[1227.70 → 1239.70] Oh no, you never let go, Lord, you never let go of me.
[1239.70 → 1245.70] You'll be a light that is coming, or the heart that holds on.
[1245.70 → 1252.70] And there will be an end to your troubles, but until that day comes,
[1252.70 → 1254.70] till I will praise you.
[1254.70 → 1256.70] Till I will praise you.
[1256.70 → 1260.70] Till I will praise you.
[1264.70 → 1270.70] I can see the light that is coming, or the heart that holds on.
[1270.70 → 1276.70] And there will be an end to your troubles, but until that day comes.
[1276.70 → 1278.70] Till I will praise you.
[1278.70 → 1280.70] Till I will praise you.
[1280.70 → 1282.70] Till I will praise you.
[1282.70 → 1294.70] Oh no, you never let go, through the calling, through the storm.
[1294.70 → 1300.70] Oh no, you never let go, through every high and every low.
[1300.70 → 1306.70] Oh no, you never let go, Lord, you never let go of me.
[1306.70 → 1312.70] Oh no, you never let go, through the calling, through the storm.
[1312.70 → 1318.70] Oh no, you never let go, in every high and every low.
[1318.70 → 1328.70] Oh no, you never let go, Lord, you never let go of me.
[1328.70 → 1353.38] This is just one of those days, one of those mornings.
[1353.38 → 1360.22] We have the opportunity to participate and share in the baptism of Lucas Said.
[1361.74 → 1366.02] And yet, twin calves were born overnight at the Said farm.
[1367.70 → 1370.76] And so we're waiting for Adam to walk in.
[1370.96 → 1372.38] He's here in the parking lot, apparently.
[1374.72 → 1379.36] And so when he gets in, he might just run straight up on the stage.
[1379.36 → 1389.74] Before we do that, just a couple of moments, points of liturgy for us as well.
[1390.18 → 1395.94] This morning, as we celebrate the baptism of one of our little ones,
[1396.30 → 1401.16] the water that we're going to use doesn't itself cleanse us from sin,
[1401.38 → 1406.02] but it symbolizes for us Jesus' life, death, and resurrection,
[1406.02 → 1408.72] which does cleanse us from sin.
[1410.14 → 1416.90] And we acknowledge this morning that Lucas, though born with a sinful nature,
[1417.44 → 1424.14] is a child offered the promises of God for forgiveness and for life in the Spirit.
[1425.40 → 1429.90] And so in the church, we baptize infants not out of superstition,
[1430.40 → 1433.74] but as covenant children.
[1433.74 → 1440.60] God's covenant with Abraham, which was sealed by circumcision in Genesis 15,
[1440.60 → 1447.82] now finds its sign and seal in baptism, as we read in Colossians 2.
[1447.82 → 1455.66] And through it, the triune God marks our adoption and our new identity in Christ,
[1455.66 → 1460.78] a promise that is extended to our children in Acts 2, verse 39,
[1461.18 → 1463.80] because God calls them holy.
[1464.54 → 1467.02] He calls them set apart in 1 Corinthians 7.
[1467.02 → 1473.80] And so as we come into this act together, baptism obeys the command of Christ.
[1474.02 → 1481.32] It aligns with the church's history, and it signifies inclusion through and to God's covenant community.
[1481.32 → 1486.76] And it's our prayer that Lucas embraces these promises,
[1487.06 → 1490.46] and that he follows Jesus throughout his entire life.
[1490.82 → 1494.90] And so Adam and Rachel and Lucas, I'm going to invite you to the front.
[1494.90 → 1511.44] Hey, buddy.
[1513.58 → 1518.42] And so before we baptize Lucas, I have two questions to ask you.
[1518.52 → 1522.98] I'll ask both of the questions, and I'll invite you to respond by saying we do with God's help.
[1522.98 → 1529.60] Adam and Rachel, do you believe that your children, though sinful by nature,
[1529.74 → 1535.28] are received by God and Christ as members of his covenant and therefore ought to be baptized?
[1536.18 → 1541.58] And do you promise in reliance on the Holy Spirit and with the help of this Christian community
[1541.58 → 1545.92] to do all in your power to instruct Lucas in the Christian faith
[1545.92 → 1550.90] and to lead him by your example into the life of Christian discipleship?
[1551.32 → 1552.06] What is your answer?
[1552.98 → 1553.60] What is your answer?
[1555.00 → 1557.46] We do with God's help and God helping us.
[1557.58 → 1560.64] You've got an old CRC-er and a new CRC-er in the building.
[1560.64 → 1568.04] I want to take this moment, and just like our Lord Jesus, who said,
[1568.20 → 1570.54] let the little children come to me and do not hinder them,
[1570.60 → 1572.82] for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these,
[1573.16 → 1577.50] I want to invite the kids who are here this morning to come on up to the front
[1577.50 → 1581.18] and just to gather seats here to make sure that you can all see
[1581.18 → 1583.40] as we come together this morning.
[1583.40 → 1584.02] Beautiful.
[1595.02 → 1595.72] Love it.
[1595.78 → 1596.04] All right.
[1596.10 → 1599.98] In just a moment, we're going to take some of this water,
[1599.98 → 1603.68] and we're going to put it on Lucas's head.
[1604.30 → 1610.32] And we do that as a picture, as a symbol that God promises to wash us clean,
[1610.42 → 1611.16] to make us clean.
[1611.16 → 1615.16] And so just like you use water, maybe last night, maybe this morning,
[1615.32 → 1617.38] hopefully within the last couple of days or so,
[1617.52 → 1618.70] to clean yourselves,
[1618.70 → 1619.96] right?
[1620.04 → 1624.32] We use water here to symbolize what Jesus does for us.
[1630.32 → 1633.28] Lucas Lars Said.
[1633.72 → 1635.70] I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[1637.66 → 1638.46] and of the Son,
[1639.50 → 1642.34] and of the Holy Spirit.
[1643.62 → 1644.10] Amen.
[1644.10 → 1644.26] Amen.
[1644.26 → 1648.90] I promise.
[1649.02 → 1649.92] It's warm water, guys.
[1654.82 → 1657.54] Congregation of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1657.64 → 1663.36] I'm going to invite you now also to participate in this ceremony together
[1663.36 → 1668.10] by standing and responding to a question that I will ask you.
[1668.88 → 1671.46] I will ask you to respond by saying,
[1671.46 → 1673.34] we do with God's help,
[1673.44 → 1675.38] if this is in fact true for you,
[1675.64 → 1677.28] in confession and in promise.
[1678.12 → 1680.30] And so do you promise to love,
[1680.48 → 1681.12] and encourage,
[1681.38 → 1682.46] and support Adam,
[1682.64 → 1683.12] and Rachel,
[1683.32 → 1683.84] and Lucas,
[1684.38 → 1686.62] by welcoming them into our church family,
[1686.72 → 1689.12] by teaching the gospel of God's love,
[1689.18 → 1691.62] and by being an example of Christian faith,
[1691.78 → 1692.48] and character,
[1692.66 → 1695.24] and by giving the strong support
[1695.24 → 1697.10] of God's family in fellowship,
[1697.58 → 1698.18] in prayer,
[1698.40 → 1699.28] and in service?
[1699.70 → 1700.40] What is your answer?
[1700.40 → 1702.90] We do with God's help.
[1703.50 → 1703.82] Amen.
[1704.58 → 1705.02] Amen.
[1705.20 → 1705.84] You may be seated.
[1706.24 → 1707.08] Thank you.
[1709.96 → 1711.74] I'm going to bless him first,
[1711.82 → 1712.44] and then I'll take him.
[1714.86 → 1718.06] We're going to pray a blessing over Lucas,
[1718.42 → 1722.18] and then we will present him as a covenant child together.
[1723.38 → 1723.90] Lucas,
[1724.44 → 1726.76] the Lord bless you and keep you.
[1726.76 → 1729.22] The Lord make his face to shine upon you
[1729.22 → 1730.48] and be gracious to you.
[1730.68 → 1732.90] The Lord turn his face toward you
[1732.90 → 1734.94] and give you his peace.
[1735.68 → 1736.60] And in this way,
[1736.94 → 1739.22] may the Lord put his name on Lucas
[1739.22 → 1741.74] and make him the Lord's own.
[1742.14 → 1742.48] Amen.
[1742.48 → 1742.64] Amen.
[1750.94 → 1752.26] His bow tie is a little big,
[1752.34 → 1752.96] but it looks cute.
[1753.04 → 1753.78] That's what I just heard.
[1753.78 → 1755.78] Let's see if that's true.
[1756.90 → 1757.74] This morning,
[1758.36 → 1761.62] we mark Lucas' journey
[1761.62 → 1766.20] and hopefully beginning of his life of faith.
[1767.08 → 1769.20] And so we pray that he'll go from this day
[1769.20 → 1770.98] in the midst of this community,
[1771.50 → 1773.74] growing in discipleship,
[1773.88 → 1776.48] growing in relationship to the Lord.
[1776.48 → 1779.72] And he does that in our midst.
[1780.26 → 1781.20] And our prayer,
[1781.56 → 1784.00] and I encourage you to join in it actively
[1784.00 → 1785.66] and verbally,
[1785.98 → 1786.44] regularly,
[1786.70 → 1788.24] is to pray for Lucas
[1788.24 → 1789.36] that one day
[1789.36 → 1791.14] we might have the blessing
[1791.14 → 1793.96] of seeing him stand before us
[1793.96 → 1795.54] in making profession of faith,
[1795.64 → 1797.82] just like we have seen Adam and Rachel
[1797.82 → 1798.96] stand before us
[1798.96 → 1801.22] and make profession of faith together.
[1801.84 → 1803.62] And that as he begins this journey
[1803.62 → 1806.40] of life and faith in our midst,
[1806.52 → 1810.04] he would do so strongly supported by you,
[1810.52 → 1812.96] his brothers and sisters in Christ.
[1813.46 → 1816.34] This is part of our picture
[1816.34 → 1818.54] this morning in baptism.
[1819.22 → 1821.32] And you are invited now
[1821.32 → 1822.52] to take that up
[1822.52 → 1826.26] and continue drawing the picture of his faith,
[1826.36 → 1827.58] being used by God
[1827.58 → 1828.62] to guide,
[1829.12 → 1829.40] keep,
[1829.74 → 1830.92] and shape Lucas
[1830.92 → 1833.56] into the disciple of Jesus
[1833.56 → 1834.44] that we pray
[1834.44 → 1835.40] he will become.
[1835.94 → 1836.20] Amen?
[1837.36 → 1837.88] Amen.
[1837.88 → 1838.06] Amen.
[1839.60 → 1840.66] He is adorable.
[1845.42 → 1847.06] What would you expect of a said?
[1847.26 → 1847.92] Not that.
[1851.32 → 1853.16] I want to invite Paul Hummel man
[1853.16 → 1854.48] up to the front for just a moment.
[1854.48 → 1855.96] He is a gift for you guys
[1855.96 → 1859.16] on behalf of the church together.
[1871.52 → 1872.50] We're going to pray together.
[1872.58 → 1873.46] Paul, would you just stay up here
[1873.46 → 1873.98] while we pray?
[1874.98 → 1875.84] Let's pray together.
[1878.44 → 1880.44] Lord, our good God,
[1880.44 → 1884.22] we are so grateful for your promises
[1884.22 → 1885.90] and so amazed
[1885.90 → 1888.00] at just how faithful you are to them.
[1888.88 → 1891.06] As this promise is now extended
[1891.06 → 1892.44] to Lucas in baptism,
[1892.96 → 1894.52] we pray that you would move
[1894.52 → 1895.98] in the power of your spirit
[1895.98 → 1900.72] so that in great and magnificent ways
[1900.72 → 1903.32] and in small and incremental ways,
[1903.56 → 1905.74] he might grow as a disciple
[1905.74 → 1907.66] of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1907.66 → 1909.88] And so, Lord God,
[1909.94 → 1912.64] as you have blessed Adam and Rachel,
[1912.84 → 1913.92] bless Lucas.
[1914.56 → 1916.26] As you have blessed us,
[1916.38 → 1916.88] your church,
[1917.16 → 1917.84] through them,
[1917.96 → 1919.68] may they all be a blessing
[1919.68 → 1921.26] in our midst as well.
[1921.86 → 1923.64] And may we, your people,
[1923.82 → 1927.04] bask in your promises today,
[1927.80 → 1929.68] trusting in your provision
[1929.68 → 1931.18] for life and faith.
[1931.86 → 1933.12] In Jesus' name we pray.
[1933.76 → 1934.16] Amen.
[1935.12 → 1935.38] Amen.
[1935.38 → 1935.52] Amen.
[1935.52 → 1938.70] We're going to stand
[1938.70 → 1940.46] and continue our worship together.
[1940.56 → 1941.50] We're going to sing a song
[1941.50 → 1942.38] that Adam and Rachel
[1942.38 → 1943.70] have picked for this occasion.
[1944.20 → 1944.76] That song is
[1944.76 → 1945.64] I Am Not My Own.
[1945.64 → 1945.74] Amen.
[1945.74 → 1946.52] Amen.
[1951.02 → 1951.58] Amen.
[1951.62 → 1952.22] Amen.
[1952.22 → 1952.28] Amen.
[1952.28 → 1952.32] Amen.
[1952.32 → 1952.46] Amen.
[1952.46 → 1952.92] Amen.
[1953.12 → 1953.40] Amen.
[1953.40 → 1953.52] Amen.
[1960.00 → 1960.46] Amen.
[1960.46 → 1960.80] Amen.
[1960.80 → 1960.86] Amen.
[1960.86 → 1961.20] Amen.
[1961.20 → 1961.78] Amen.
[1961.78 → 1962.50] Amen.
[1962.50 → 1962.92] Amen.
[1962.92 → 1963.30] Amen.
[1963.30 → 1963.72] Amen.
[1963.72 → 1964.42] Amen.
[1964.42 → 1965.28] Amen.
[1965.28 → 1965.50] Amen.
[1965.50 → 1979.50] oh
[1984.14 → 1993.50] is
[1995.50 → 1997.94] is
[1998.02 → 2006.50] oh
[2016.44 → 2016.56] so
[2016.56 → 2030.56] my
[2033.52 → 2044.56] to turn my life in such a way
[2046.56 → 2069.44] and unbathed
[2076.56 → 2080.56] Rise, my Lord.
[2080.56 → 2110.54] Rise, my Lord.
[2110.56 → 2116.54] Of eternal life that made me willing and ready.
[2117.44 → 2120.60] Even when I can't see my word.
[2123.24 → 2127.36] From now on to always live for you.
[2130.94 → 2135.00] I am not my own.
[2135.00 → 2141.18] But belong body and soul.
[2141.60 → 2147.10] In my life and in death.
[2147.60 → 2153.00] To you, Lord, rise my Lord.
[2153.00 → 2158.98] I am not my own.
[2159.30 → 2165.06] But belong body and soul.
[2165.42 → 2170.98] In my life and in death.
[2170.98 → 2178.96] To you, Lord, rise my Lord.
[2178.96 → 2208.94] I am not my own.
[2208.94 → 2216.74] My Lord, rise my Lord.
[2217.38 → 2220.74] I am not my other Jun yanmirolaju.
[2220.74 → 2250.72] maintains for its many ministries. And we just want to say a huge thank-you. As you've probably seen in the bulletin that you perhaps get in your email, there is a bit of a shortfall, of course, as we come to the end of the budget year. And there's been some really great momentum, and we're catching up on that sort of that gap. So thank you again. And we just want to also ask that you consider in this last month how you could give and help us continue to fill that gap and that
[2250.74 → 2280.14] shortfall. So thank you again, and please prayerfully consider your donations this next month. Also, we'll take a moment now to give to the ministries of this church and also to the Diaconal Ministries. It is an organization or an agency that partners with the CRC church that works with deacons and deacon work across Canada, helping deacons be trained to be deacons, helping them work with local ministries in their own communities, and staying really active.
[2280.14 → 2289.20] So we in this church have definitely benefited from their involvement the last 15–20 years. So we'd love to give back to them this morning. So thank you.
[2310.14 → 2312.14] Thank you.
[2312.14 → 2313.14] Thank you.
[2313.14 → 2314.14] Thank you.
[2314.14 → 2344.14] 
[2344.14 → 2349.46] O Lord, our souls in stillness wait.
[2350.50 → 2353.58] Truly our hope is in you.
[2354.72 → 2358.14] Truly our hope is in you.
[2360.06 → 2364.58] O Lord of life, our only hope.
[2364.94 → 2371.44] Your radiance shines on all who look to you in the dark.
[2371.44 → 2376.52] Emmanuel, come, come light our heart.
[2379.46 → 2385.70] For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness wait.
[2387.78 → 2394.88] For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness wait.
[2395.78 → 2398.92] Truly our hope is in you.
[2398.92 → 2403.92] Truly our hope is in you.
[2405.36 → 2411.18] O joy above all other loves in you.
[2411.42 → 2413.92] We find more than enough.
[2414.76 → 2416.88] We come as we are.
[2417.00 → 2420.92] Woke, heal and restore, untie our heart.
[2420.92 → 2422.92] For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness wait.
[2422.92 → 2426.92] For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness wait.
[2426.92 → 2433.92] For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness wait.
[2433.92 → 2440.92] For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness wait.
[2440.92 → 2447.92] For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness wait.
[2447.92 → 2458.92] For you, O Lord, our souls in stillness wait.
[2458.92 → 2459.44] Amen.
[2459.44 → 2459.60] Amen.
[2468.18 → 2472.50] Okay, I'm going to invite the kids back up for Kids Corner.
[2473.20 → 2476.96] So if you are, I think, age three up to grade four, come on up.
[2477.20 → 2481.44] We'll chat for a minute, and then we will head off to children's worship time.
[2481.44 → 2489.38] Good to see you guys.
[2489.74 → 2491.06] Man, there are lots of you guys today.
[2491.16 → 2492.04] This is great.
[2492.76 → 2496.50] I have a quick question, and then we're going to head off to children's worship time because
[2496.50 → 2497.70] we've got lots to do today.
[2499.32 → 2503.56] We're going to talk about big stuff today in children's worship time.
[2503.56 → 2509.62] Have you guys heard of the Saudi Arabian Desert?
[2512.10 → 2512.46] No?
[2512.72 → 2514.48] You don't have a poster up on your door?
[2514.50 → 2515.18] Oh, you have.
[2515.28 → 2515.70] Okay, good.
[2516.02 → 2516.20] Well.
[2516.38 → 2518.36] We have a story about it.
[2518.44 → 2520.36] Oh, you guys got a story about it.
[2520.40 → 2523.44] It is a big desert in the Middle East.
[2524.00 → 2529.18] And we have been learning about the Egyptians wandering through the desert, looking and hoping
[2529.18 → 2529.94] for a home.
[2530.08 → 2532.68] Do you guys know how big the Saudi Arabian Desert is?
[2532.68 → 2533.42] Any guesses?
[2533.56 → 2536.48] How big do you think it is?
[2536.58 → 2537.04] What do you think?
[2537.08 → 2537.86] How big is it?
[2541.72 → 2542.16] Okay.
[2542.54 → 2544.70] Joseph had some involvement maybe there.
[2545.42 → 2546.40] Do you guys know how big it is?
[2546.44 → 2547.18] It's so big.
[2547.52 → 2548.08] So big.
[2550.52 → 2555.22] How many millions of square kilometres do you think it is?
[2556.14 → 2556.58] Five?
[2556.76 → 2557.40] Good guess.
[2558.40 → 2558.84] Three?
[2559.22 → 2559.86] Good guess.
[2561.18 → 2562.40] It's a crazy number.
[2562.40 → 2563.92] I mean, who can think in the millions?
[2563.92 → 2564.36] 50?
[2564.58 → 2566.02] It's 2.33.
[2566.72 → 2567.06] Okay?
[2567.64 → 2567.98] Yeah.
[2568.36 → 2571.10] That's critical to our lesson today.
[2571.38 → 2572.28] No, it's not.
[2572.50 → 2579.02] So, we're going to go talk more, not about the desert, but about some big stuff that happened
[2579.02 → 2585.38] as the Israelites were still wandering the desert and trying to figure out their way.
[2585.38 → 2586.02] Okay?
[2586.02 → 2586.08] Okay?
[2586.52 → 2588.96] So, let's go do that together in children's worship time.
[2589.10 → 2594.60] But first, we will bless those that are going to stay here, and I think they will bless
[2594.60 → 2597.02] us in return as we go off to do some stuff together.
[2597.16 → 2597.88] So, let's stand.
[2598.48 → 2601.56] We'll put up our hands together, and we'll stand with the congregation.
[2603.30 → 2604.04] Ready, guys?
[2604.04 → 2606.58] The Lord be with you.
[2606.84 → 2608.38] And also with you.
[2634.04 → 2642.16] Good morning.
[2643.36 → 2647.36] As an elder here, it's my privilege to lead you in congregational prayer.
[2648.64 → 2658.86] On a note this morning, Linda Rook of Neil and Linda Rook got the news that her biopsy
[2658.86 → 2663.24] came back clear, and her cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes.
[2667.14 → 2669.74] She and Neil are grateful to God for answered prayer.
[2669.92 → 2675.30] However, the doctors did find more cancer cells near the area, and as a result, she is
[2675.30 → 2678.90] having a second surgery on Wednesday to get that removed.
[2679.44 → 2685.24] So, she asked for her prayers for a successful surgery and a quick recovery after that, so
[2685.24 → 2687.40] we'll remember them in our prayers as well.
[2687.90 → 2688.72] Please join me.
[2688.86 → 2689.86] Thank you.
[2696.26 → 2703.68] Our Father in heaven, it is with Thanksgiving that we can come to your house to give you
[2703.68 → 2708.96] praise through our songs and meditations, and to hear your gospel proclaimed.
[2709.94 → 2715.58] When we consider the beauty of your creation and the world around us, we stand in awe of
[2715.58 → 2716.84] your wisdom and your power.
[2716.84 → 2724.64] O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is your name in all the earth, who have set your glory above
[2724.64 → 2725.28] the heavens.
[2725.28 → 2750.90] Father, we confess that we have not followed in your commandments.
[2750.90 → 2751.90] We have not lived according to your word.
[2751.90 → 2753.94] We have not lived according to your word.
[2755.50 → 2760.64] Help to prepare our hearts and minds this week, especially as we partake in the Lord's
[2760.64 → 2761.54] supper next Sunday.
[2761.54 → 2765.54] We thank you for this church family at Emmanuel.
[2765.54 → 2772.04] We lift those who continue to experience the pain of losing loved ones and pray for your
[2772.04 → 2772.48] peace.
[2773.48 → 2778.00] Be with those dealing with physical limitations, loneliness, depression.
[2778.26 → 2780.00] Lift them up by your presence, Lord.
[2780.00 → 2789.92] Lord, we ask for a positive prognosis for Clary Closteroff's father and guidance for the doctors and the nurses that are caring for him.
[2791.04 → 2793.32] We pray for Ashley and her family.
[2794.22 → 2803.66] Give Ashley the perseverance to go through her chemotherapy treatment and that it may be successful and that she may be completely restored to her family.
[2803.66 → 2809.82] We ask, Lord, that you visit those unable to come and worship with us physically.
[2810.38 → 2813.24] Enable those who are shut in to feel your presence.
[2814.06 → 2819.78] We give thanks that Mary Fritz could come home and pray that she adjusts quickly with a new hip.
[2821.18 → 2823.52] We also pray for Neil and Linda Rook.
[2823.92 → 2827.16] Thank you, Lord, that the cancer had not spread to her lymph nodes.
[2827.72 → 2832.38] And grant your peace and healing to Linda as she undergoes surgery this Wednesday.
[2832.38 → 2832.58] Amen.
[2833.78 → 2839.44] Almighty and everlasting God, who has caused your holy word to be written for our learning.
[2840.20 → 2845.52] Bless Pastor Chris so we may hear your words, read them, and live them.
[2845.78 → 2847.32] We pray this in Jesus' name.
[2847.84 → 2848.12] Amen.
[2862.38 → 2863.38] Amen.
[2863.38 → 2864.38] Amen.
[2867.32 → 2876.26] We're going to spend some time together this morning in God's Word, primarily in Isaiah 9.
[2877.34 → 2880.30] We're going to read verses 2 through 7.
[2881.14 → 2885.08] That's going to be on the screen behind me the first time we go through.
[2885.08 → 2892.66] and I encourage you if you have a Bible either an actual physical copy to open that up to Isaiah
[2892.66 → 2898.54] 9 and to keep that open or if it's on your phone your device whatever scroll there keep that with
[2898.54 → 2902.96] you if you're looking for a Bible to hang on to there's a few at the back you can grab there
[2902.96 → 2912.52] and use those. Let's read from Isaiah 9 starting at verse 2 together.
[2915.08 → 2924.64] The people walking in darkness have seen a great light on those living in the land of deep darkness
[2924.64 → 2932.24] a light has dawned you have enlarged the nation and increased their joy they rejoice before you
[2932.24 → 2938.80] as a people rejoice at the harvest as warriors rejoice when dividing the plunder for as in the
[2938.80 → 2944.84] day of Median's defeat you have shattered the yoke that burdens them the bar across their shoulders
[2944.84 → 2951.46] the rod of their oppressors. Every warrior's boot used in battle and every garment rolled in blood
[2951.46 → 2960.06] will be destined for burning will be fueled for the fire for to us a child is born to us a son is given
[2960.06 → 2967.20] and the government will be on his shoulders and he will be called wonderful counsellor mighty God
[2967.20 → 2976.22] everlasting father prince of peace of the greatness of his government and peace there will be no end
[2976.22 → 2983.62] he will reign on David's throne and over his kingdom establishing and upholding it with justice
[2983.62 → 2993.02] and righteousness from that time on and forever the zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this
[2993.02 → 2994.90] this is the word of the Lord
[2994.90 → 3010.90] a bunch of years ago I heard a story from someone who left the Christian faith
[3010.90 → 3013.68] now today we would call it deconstruction
[3013.68 → 3025.34] she deconstructed, and she said that the peace that finally did her in was the idea that God is a
[3025.34 → 3033.52] jealous God right she remembered the line from the Ten Commandments that says for I the Lord your God
[3033.52 → 3039.74] am a jealous God punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation
[3039.74 → 3051.34] jealousy is a negative emotion she reasoned, and a good God can't have that and a jealousy that leads to
[3051.34 → 3062.72] punishing children was a non-starter for her so she walked away after that she turned to some ways of
[3062.72 → 3069.66] seeing and being in the world that are pretty common in today's culture and life right without
[3069.66 → 3078.18] a personal and personalizing God in her life she started talking about these non-personal forces and about
[3078.18 → 3084.80] manifesting things she wouldn't talk about spiritual realities per se because spiritual was too close to
[3084.80 → 3094.10] Christian for her, but instead she would talk about drawing good things towards you by putting good energy
[3094.10 → 3104.04] out in the world now honestly this was 15 years ago but this sounds like so much of the influencers and gurus and
[3104.04 → 3111.62] people you hear on Instagram and TikTok right now right she sounds like so many of the people in the world that I
[3111.62 → 3119.10] talk to at the soccer field or who haven't grown up in Christian faith this kind of language is so ubiquitous
[3119.10 → 3127.62] everywhere present in our culture that even people who've grown up in a Christian home are using it
[3127.62 → 3136.80] and talking like that and Christmas isn't really that different right in our post-Christian secular culture
[3136.80 → 3143.58] and when I say secular I don't mean like atheist or non-religious I'm using the word secular in a technical
[3143.58 → 3149.54] sense the way that Catholic social philosopher Charles Taylor uses it where he says that secular
[3149.54 → 3158.16] is the eclipsing of all goals beyond human flourishing and the point there the point there is that we live
[3158.16 → 3164.88] like the only thing that matters is personal happiness or personal flourishing right and in that there may be a
[3164.88 → 3174.86] caveat about not harming other people but this kind of secularization puts me puts I at the centre of the
[3174.86 → 3181.78] universe and all of us are the centres of our own universes or what do they say now you have main character
[3181.78 → 3189.12] energy right centre of your own universe, and we just orbit around each other right I get what I want
[3189.12 → 3196.60] to be really clear again I'm not even talking about things not even talking about stuff or presence and
[3196.60 → 3203.62] the like right I'm talking about like certain personal feelings I want to feel cozy I want to feel loved
[3203.62 → 3210.38] right by one person or by four right I want to feel like we're together I want these warm fuzzy feelings
[3210.38 → 3222.64] and all of that is disconnected from God or Jesus or church like the woman I knew 15 years ago modern day
[3222.64 → 3230.82] spirituality makes everything about me and about my experience about me and my feelings and I want to
[3230.82 → 3238.66] suggest this morning that one of the ways that this is in comp accomplished right is by depersonalizing
[3238.66 → 3248.70] God so instead of God we get an energy we get a force we get a universal thing right that I
[3248.70 → 3259.34] ultimately control or bend to my will when God becomes what I desire I have to make God into something
[3259.34 → 3268.64] that doesn't have his or her or their its own desires right when my desire becomes God to
[3268.64 → 3280.98] me that God can't have desires of its own that's what depersonalizing God does in short the problem
[3280.98 → 3290.96] isn't that God is jealous the problem is that God has any feelings of his own at all right a personal
[3290.96 → 3297.70] God will be jealous for something a good God the God of the Bible will be jealous for the right thing
[3297.70 → 3305.84] instead what so many of us think we want is the God of my desire
[3305.84 → 3319.20] now here's what I believe you are created you are in this world you have a longing in your heart that
[3319.20 → 3326.32] sometimes you just can't put words to and with that longing and for that longing and out of that longing
[3326.32 → 3333.32] we try to fill our lives with stuff and with things and with people with relationships with sex or with
[3333.32 → 3339.72] drinking or drugs or work or titles or status or energies or vibes I hate that word
[3339.72 → 3350.28] right whatever you desire it just never lasts and so you try again you try somewhere else you try
[3350.28 → 3355.86] something else you say oh just a little bit more and again and again and again, and it goes and all of
[3355.86 → 3361.76] this fumbling around in the darkness is trying to figure it out on our own, and it just proves it just
[3361.76 → 3368.52] proves that we were created for something different for something more for something transcendent and yet
[3368.52 → 3374.56] relational someone who is and who can be jealous for you
[3374.56 → 3384.48] and I think that when we look a little bit more closely you will find that the modern move of
[3384.48 → 3393.56] depersonalizing God and talking about sort of nebulous spiritual forces and good energies just doesn't satisfy
[3393.56 → 3395.56] satisfy your heart
[3395.56 → 3412.28] this Christmas we are looking for a personal God with a plan and a purpose that's our theme this morning we
[3412.28 → 3422.36] are looking for a personal God with a plan and a purpose now we read from Isaiah 9 verse 2 to 7, and we're
[3422.36 → 3432.44] going to see this here right in the middle we see it all right in the middle at verse 6 right we have a child
[3432.44 → 3440.60] who will be born a son that's the plan, and he will be king more than that he will be wonderful counsellor
[3440.60 → 3449.96] mighty God everlasting father prince of peace that's the personal God and this God who has a plan he will be
[3449.96 → 3457.88] forever, and he will bring about peace and justice and righteousness that is his purpose we're looking
[3457.88 → 3464.92] for a personal God with a plan and with a purpose and to help us see that let's start at the end with
[3464.92 → 3474.84] purpose peace justice and righteousness of the greatness of his government and peace there will be no end he will
[3474.84 → 3481.48] reign on David's throne and over his kingdom establishing it and upholding it with justice and righteousness
[3481.48 → 3484.92] from that time on and forever
[3484.92 → 3488.76] peace justice and righteousness forever
[3488.76 → 3498.84] that personal God that our hearts are longing for has a plan to bring about his purpose and part of his
[3498.84 → 3508.92] purpose is peace and justice and righteousness now in the Bible peace is about so much more than a state of
[3508.92 → 3516.68] being or living without war right peace in Hebrew the word is shalom right it's about wholeness
[3517.64 → 3526.52] it's about being fully human fully alive right peace is union and communion with God and with other people
[3526.52 → 3535.16] and with creation as it stewards right peace is the fullness of life ultimate satisfaction peace is in the
[3535.16 → 3543.56] words of Jesus drinking the living water after which you will never thirst again right shalom is about right
[3544.12 → 3554.60] relationship living restored to right relationship is going to then be characterized by two things justice
[3554.60 → 3556.36] justice and righteousness
[3556.36 → 3558.20] justice and righteousness
[3559.72 → 3569.88] often in the Bible but especially in the Old Testament these two word justice and righteousness come as a pair that's their often together
[3571.40 → 3572.28] but here's the thing
[3573.16 → 3575.16] for so many of us especially
[3575.40 → 3581.96] us New Testament Christians people who've been around the church for quite a while we think of justice and righteousness
[3582.60 → 3584.76] only in theological categories
[3585.96 → 3590.60] right justice and righteousness for many of us honestly have become kind of Christians
[3591.72 → 3596.60] right a special language to us and it kind of just rolls off our back because like yeah I heard that term again before
[3597.64 → 3601.72] right and these terms and their meanings are assumed, and they're used
[3602.60 → 3611.16] especially in relationship to salvation and to atonement theories right particularly in an atonement theory that's called penal substitutionary atonement
[3611.16 → 3612.60] now
[3613.32 → 3618.12] maybe clear because that move that theological category isn't wrong
[3619.64 → 3621.16] but it's also not all
[3622.60 → 3628.36] right if we only ever think of justice and righteousness in those terms it actually does become wrong
[3628.36 → 3632.76] because before these were theological terms
[3632.76 → 3635.56] justice and righteousness were economic terms
[3637.80 → 3641.72] right it's about equality of opportunity in society
[3641.72 → 3647.16] it's about everybody getting a fair shake and getting proper or fair reward that's justice
[3648.36 → 3653.48] right it's about communal systems of support and right action that's righteousness
[3654.36 → 3657.56] right righteousness is a community term it is a covenant
[3658.12 → 3658.44] term
[3658.44 → 3665.40] and the promise of peace and justice and righteousness in the kingdom of Jesus is about
[3665.40 → 3675.88] more than reconciliation with god and with salvation theories, and again it starts there and those are critical it's sustained there and that's perhaps even the pinnacle of this revelation
[3675.88 → 3677.32] but justice and peace and righteousness
[3677.32 → 3682.68] also spill out to a fuller expression of what it means to be
[3683.16 → 3691.32] human fully alive living in community together created for god created for one another and living in ways that express
[3691.32 → 3692.52] God's God's God's design
[3692.52 → 3693.56] God's design
[3693.56 → 3694.76] and if we miss that
[3695.72 → 3696.84] we miss our purpose
[3697.88 → 3702.28] we miss the fullness of what the promise of Christmas actually means
[3703.80 → 3711.72] right peace and justice justification and righteousness are gifts of god by grace to those who believe
[3712.04 → 3718.52] and they are also realities that flow out of that gift of right relationship with God
[3718.52 → 3728.12] they are realities that pour out of you and me and of all of us who believe realities that flow out to the world around us confirming our belief
[3728.52 → 3732.84] proclaiming God's good news and his forever purposes in the world
[3734.44 → 3740.52] you are now a people who pursue justice and who stand against injustice
[3742.12 → 3747.08] you do this in small ways in unsung ways in unlauded by society ways
[3747.08 → 3752.68] you do this in ways that might not even make sense to a secularized or secularizing world
[3752.68 → 3757.80] because you know that your life isn't about you any more you know that you are not your own
[3758.36 → 3762.68] but belong body and soul and life and in death to your faithful saviour Jesus Christ
[3763.32 → 3768.68] and you do this in big ways in systemic ways in addressing economic injustice
[3769.56 → 3771.40] in standing up against racism
[3771.40 → 3778.28] right you get involved in politics because you really believe that God's purposes are actually best for everyone
[3779.56 → 3787.48] you think about regenerative practices in your farming because you know that part of our purpose is lived in relationship with creation
[3787.72 → 3789.40] right to work it and keep it
[3790.68 → 3796.52] every area every sphere of your life is touched by this purpose of God
[3796.52 → 3798.84] peace
[3798.84 → 3799.96] justice
[3799.96 → 3800.68] justice
[3800.68 → 3802.68] and righteousness
[3804.20 → 3805.48] that's the promise of Christmas
[3807.80 → 3812.92] now this text starts in the middle with a promise, and it ends with a guarantee
[3813.72 → 3818.20] right the last line the zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this
[3819.16 → 3821.24] how do we know that this promise is true
[3822.20 → 3827.16] that this promise is going to happen that it's going to come to fruition as God has designed and planned and ordained
[3828.12 → 3831.48] well the zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish it
[3833.08 → 3837.96] and so I guess the next question is what is the Lord's zeal what is he zealous for
[3840.04 → 3841.08] now the Hebrew word
[3843.00 → 3844.04] zeal is
[3844.04 → 3844.76] Dinah
[3844.76 → 3851.16] it comes actually from the colour that's produced in the face by intense deep emotion
[3851.88 → 3853.80] right a deep red or purple
[3854.44 → 3856.60] sometimes even black like a like
[3857.56 → 3859.56] bruises go red to purple and black
[3859.88 → 3864.44] right it describes an intense feeling an intense commitment
[3864.44 → 3866.36] zeal is a passion
[3866.36 → 3867.08] it is a
[3867.08 → 3867.96] a rage
[3867.96 → 3869.80] it is an unyielding devotion
[3869.80 → 3871.00] it is unflinching
[3871.00 → 3871.96] commitment
[3871.96 → 3875.32] it's the same word that's translated jealous
[3878.12 → 3879.24] the Lord your God
[3879.88 → 3881.96] is a zealous God
[3881.96 → 3884.28] and so he acts jealously
[3884.92 → 3885.96] for those whom he loves
[3887.08 → 3891.24] and in the Bible there are two things that God is zealous for
[3892.52 → 3895.40] two things that we see over and over and over again his people
[3895.40 → 3897.00] and his honour
[3897.00 → 3898.68] his glory
[3898.68 → 3902.04] all right let's let's do some biblical theology for a minute
[3902.76 → 3905.56] Zechariah 1 verse 14 says literally
[3905.56 → 3910.92] I am zealous for Jerusalem for Zion greatly zealous
[3912.04 → 3917.72] right zeal is the Lord's intense devotion to and love for his people
[3917.72 → 3920.28] it's why he saves them
[3920.28 → 3921.40] it's why he defends them
[3921.40 → 3924.04] it's why over and over and over again he rescues them
[3924.04 → 3925.40] it's why he vindicates them
[3925.40 → 3927.16] why he fulfills his promises to them
[3927.16 → 3931.80] right his zeal for his people burns brightly in his face
[3931.80 → 3937.40] God is zealous for his people, and he is zealous for his honour
[3937.40 → 3937.88] right
[3937.88 → 3940.44] Exodus 2 5 we've read part of it already
[3940.44 → 3942.92] you shall not bow down to them and worship them
[3942.92 → 3945.00] this is the commandment against idolatry
[3945.00 → 3948.36] for I the Lord your God am a jealous God
[3949.08 → 3953.08] right jealous and zealous share a root in Hebrew
[3953.08 → 3959.72] Isaiah 42 we read I am the Lord that is my name I will not give my glory to another
[3959.72 → 3964.20] the Lord will march out like a mighty man like a warrior he will stir up his
[3964.84 → 3965.24] zeal
[3966.44 → 3970.68] with a shout he will raise the battle cry and will triumph over his enemies
[3972.04 → 3977.72] and with God's honour is his wrath against sin which is an affront to his honour
[3977.72 → 3982.68] right the Bible goes on to say in Ezekiel of the people of Jerusalem
[3983.08 → 3984.04] in Ezekiel 5
[3984.68 → 3990.44] you have been more unruly than the nations around you and have not followed my decrees or kept my laws
[3990.92 → 3995.48] I myself am against you Jerusalem I will inflict punishment on you
[3995.48 → 4002.60] when I have spent my wrath on them, they will know that I the Lord have spoken in my zeal
[4004.76 → 4009.88] and again Ezekiel he does this work for us, he ties together the zeal of God for his people
[4009.88 → 4015.40] and the zeal of God for his honour together in the same idea in Ezekiel 39 he says this
[4015.40 → 4021.16] therefore is what the Lord the sovereign says I will now restore the fortunes of Jacob and will
[4021.16 → 4027.56] have compassion and all the people of Israel and I will be zealous for my holy name
[4029.64 → 4035.96] and so here right when Isaiah ends our text that we read when he ends it by saying the zeal of the
[4035.96 → 4042.52] Lord almighty will accomplish this he's telling us what's at stake for God in this he's telling us what
[4042.52 → 4049.16] this is really about God's commitment to his own glory and to his people that's what's really going on in
[4049.16 → 4056.44] Christmas at the promise of a child of a son who will hold the world on his shoulders whose kingdom will no, no
[4056.44 → 4062.92] end either geographically or temporally right a son who will exercise perfect justice and righteousness
[4062.92 → 4071.64] and who will bring us peace all of this is predicated on God's own zeal God's commitment to his own people
[4071.64 → 4077.96] and his own honour his commitment to love and glory right make the promise to Isaiah and through Isaiah
[4078.60 → 4085.80] Isaiah a guarantee that's how we can know this is true right the promise of a perfect kingdom of peace
[4085.80 → 4093.00] and justice and righteousness is a fact of history it will happen saying the zeal of the Lord will
[4093.00 → 4099.48] accomplish this is as if God is saying what is at stake here is more than just words more than just a
[4099.48 → 4107.40] promise it is my character it is my being myself as God that's what's on the line and that's why you can
[4107.40 → 4118.28] know this is true forever God is zealous for his people he loves them and God is zealous for his honour he
[4118.28 → 4127.32] will be glorified, but the zeal of God is his passionate pursuit of his people and his holding high his holiness
[4127.32 → 4142.68] and honour and for God those aren't contradictory dispositions right this is not a dichotomy between
[4142.68 → 4149.16] people and honour his love and his holiness is not a dichotomy between his affection and his glory in fact
[4149.16 → 4160.92] they come together no one has stated this I think with such precision as uh Jonathan Edwards who's an 18th
[4160.92 → 4170.52] century pastor and theologian he says god's respect to the creature's good and his respect to himself
[4170.52 → 4178.52] is not a divided respect both are united in one as the happiness of the creature is
[4178.52 → 4189.08] is aimed at the happiness in union with himself with god's commitment to his own glory is for your
[4189.08 → 4201.48] good god's commitment to you means that he must be zealous for his glory god is zealous for his glory
[4201.48 → 4207.16] and he is jealous for you because of it and so let's pull all this together
[4209.40 → 4215.40] god's commitment to his people to those who truly believe in him who trust in him alone for their
[4215.40 → 4223.40] salvation and god's commitment to his glory means he cannot fail means his promises endure forever
[4223.40 → 4230.52] means he actually does have the words of eternal life means that peace and justice and righteousness will reign
[4230.52 → 4240.36] forever, and you can rest secure in him, you are held in the affections of this god by grace through faith and when
[4242.60 → 4249.24] when you know the child who was born when you know the son who was given
[4249.24 → 4255.96] all the promise of god all the promises of god all the pursuits of god's all the world's turns and
[4255.96 → 4263.56] movements and machinations are for your good that's god's plan and that's the promise that we baptized
[4263.56 → 4270.52] Lucas into this morning the promise that was spoken over him and has spoken over all of us each time we read
[4270.52 → 4271.56] these words
[4274.92 → 4276.44] here's what I want you to hear this morning
[4279.24 → 4284.12] whether you are here with child or with cancer
[4286.60 → 4292.04] whether you are here singing for joy or shuffling in injury and post-op recovery
[4293.00 → 4301.40] whether you are here terrific and joyful or terrified and crying whether you are full of wonder or just
[4301.40 → 4310.76] wondering god has a plan for all of it god has a plan, and it is good
[4310.76 → 4323.24] god has a plan, and it's for you right if god is for us who can be against us there 's's a majestic
[4323.24 → 4332.04] meaning to all of this and that majestic meaning may be bound up in eternity but so are you the teacher
[4332.04 → 4337.72] in Ecclesiastes he says god has put eternity in every human heart
[4339.96 → 4346.44] and i know in today's world right where this world is all there is
[4347.32 → 4355.16] where meaning has to be imminent right where the payoff has to be immediate right this idea this truth is
[4355.16 → 4364.92] almost impossible to grasp or to really feel the pull of the transcendent and there's a beauty here right that that stirs
[4364.92 → 4372.44] our haunting for more there's something going on and part of that beauty for us today is that it is true
[4373.48 → 4384.20] all of it as insane and ridiculous as it sounds it is true god has a plan, and it is meaningful and in the Christian
[4384.20 → 4391.64] gospel there's no such thing then as meaninglessness or meaningless suffering or empty joy everything
[4391.64 → 4401.00] is filled to overflowing with what one theologian calls a peculiar glory your life your affection your
[4401.00 → 4409.40] worship your hardship your trials your tribulations they produce a peculiar particular weight of glory
[4409.40 → 4419.56] your story wrapped up in god's story such that there is now nothing that can separate you from the love of god that is available in Christ Jesus our lord
[4421.32 → 4422.20] how do I know this
[4424.12 → 4425.00] well I've lived it
[4426.20 → 4429.16] I've tasted it I've seen it in my own life
[4431.56 → 4433.00] but that's no guarantee for you
[4433.00 → 4436.60] the only guarantee for you
[4438.12 → 4445.48] is that the zeal of the lord almighty the zeal of the lord almighty will accomplish this right god is
[4445.48 → 4454.52] zealous for his people he is jealous for his honour and here his love and his glory meet on display for us to see
[4454.52 → 4462.68] the promise of Isaiah 9 is signed is guaranteed for us by the zeal of god it's as if god himself
[4462.68 → 4466.60] with his self has signed this promise with more than a signature
[4468.44 → 4475.08] right because if it was just a signature it would only be a legal document god signs it
[4475.08 → 4484.84] with his son in his own blood the son who was promised the king who would come who did come
[4484.84 → 4492.76] already as a baby king of kings and lord of lords the world missed him angels bowed down before him
[4492.76 → 4501.64] and one day every knee will bow every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is lord he is the mighty god and
[4501.64 → 4508.12] the prince of peace and this child he grows up not to command armies but to live with the poor and the
[4508.12 → 4515.32] prostitutes he comes grows up to teach a rag back ragtag bunch of rejects to live and to love as god
[4515.32 → 4522.68] does pursue justice and righteousness this child who was perfectly obedient to the father who knew no sin
[4522.68 → 4530.28] became sin for us, he lived the life I should have lived and died the death that I deserved and by him
[4530.28 → 4537.08] sinners become saints that the wrath of god for sin is overwhelmed by the love of god for his people
[4538.52 → 4546.60] that's why Matthew takes this text in Isaiah 9, and he reads it and applies it to Jesus all right the
[4546.60 → 4552.76] people living in darkness have seen a great light on those living in the land the shadow of death a light
[4552.76 → 4564.12] has dawned and after Matthew quotes this he says in Matthew 4 17 from that time on Jesus began to preach
[4564.92 → 4569.64] repent for the kingdom of heaven has come near
[4572.36 → 4582.20] in this man the kingdom of heaven has come near in this man peace and justice and righteousness has come
[4582.20 → 4590.44] to you don't miss it again this Christmas the zeal of god for his people in order to satisfy the zeal of
[4590.44 → 4597.56] god for his honour made Jesus the satisfaction for our sins so that now my zeal for god's love my zeal for
[4597.56 → 4607.24] his glory are how I truly live satisfied with him, and it's that zeal of god that makes salvation possible it
[4607.24 → 4613.48] is that zeal of god that sends him to the earth in Jesus at Christmas, and it's that zeal of god that
[4613.48 → 4621.56] jealousy of god that sustains you now in life and in death, but the zeal of god is his passionate pursuit
[4621.56 → 4629.64] for his people and is holding high his honour and holiness, and we just can't stop talking about a jealous
[4629.64 → 4635.08] god right whether to the mountains or over the hills or to the coffee shops or the barber shops
[4635.08 → 4641.48] right the zeal of god for his people the zeal of god for his honour is what makes Christmas Christmas
[4643.08 → 4650.92] the people walking in darkness have seen a great light it is now your job to take that light and walk
[4650.92 → 4660.36] in the darkness and say look at this god who is jealous for you
[4660.36 → 4669.48] that is a Christmas gift worth waiting for amen let's pray together
[4674.84 → 4683.40] holy god you send us out into the darkness to proclaim your kingdom come and your kingdom coming
[4683.40 → 4692.20] but you do not send us out empty-handed you equip us you give us the light of the gospel you give us the
[4692.20 → 4703.96] power of your Holy Spirit you send us out now as those who have drank deeply of the living water and who now
[4703.96 → 4715.64] radiate forth that same light as you are light of the world you said to us that we have become lights to the world
[4716.20 → 4726.12] and so may we shine brightly this Christmas season revealing the truth of a personal god with a plan and a purpose
[4726.12 → 4734.44] and may all who see us know may all who engage with us know a little taste of your peace
[4735.56 → 4742.92] your justice and your righteousness the world cries out, and it doesn't know for whom it is crying
[4744.04 → 4750.28] we do, and so we go in the power of your spirit in Jesus name amen
