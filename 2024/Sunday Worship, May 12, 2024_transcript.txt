[1769.60 --> 1799.58]  Thank you.
[1799.60 --> 1829.58]  Thank you.
[1829.60 --> 1859.58]  Thank you.
[1859.60 --> 1889.58]  Thank you.
[1889.60 --> 1919.58]  Thank you.
[1919.60 --> 1949.58]  Thank you.
[1949.60 --> 1979.58]  Thank you.
[1979.58 --> 2009.56]  Thank you.
[2009.56 --> 2039.54]  Thank you.
[2039.54 --> 2069.52]  Thank you.
[2069.52 --> 2099.50]  Thank you.
[2099.52 --> 2129.50]  Thank you.
[2129.50 --> 2159.48]  Thank you.
[2159.48 --> 2189.46]  Thank you.
[2189.48 --> 2219.46]  Thank you.
[2219.48 --> 2249.46]  Thank you.
[2249.48 --> 2279.46]  Good morning.
[2279.46 --> 2309.44]  Thank you.
[2309.44 --> 2339.44]  So,
[2339.44 --> 2369.44]  Thank you.
[2369.44 --> 2371.44]  Can everyone, can everyone,
[2399.44 --> 2429.44]  good morning,
[2429.44 --> 2459.42]  turn in, you know,
[2459.44 --> 2489.44]  cancer, and you know,
[2489.44 --> 2519.44]  lovely, clear debut.
[2519.44 --> 2523.36]  presence of the Northern Lights the past and nights are a testament to your power and greatness
[2523.36 --> 2530.32]  and flair for beauty and surprises in nature that you share with us. Today is Mother's Day, Lord,
[2530.36 --> 2536.10]  and we take this day in the year to be intentional about celebrating our mothers. Our moms have a
[2536.10 --> 2542.22]  difficult job, but also a rewarding one. The blessing moms are to us for the commitment they
[2542.22 --> 2548.46]  have to the responsibility of being a mom is amazing. So Lord, we pray for blessings on them.
[2548.46 --> 2555.62]  We pray for strength, health, and joy in their journey as a mom. We also pray, Lord, for those
[2555.62 --> 2561.48]  who find Mother's Day difficult, whether it's the longing to be a mom, losing a mom, losing a child,
[2561.62 --> 2567.84]  or due to strained relationships. Grant these moms, Lord, comfort and peace and the insurance of your
[2567.84 --> 2573.98]  presence in their lives. Lord, we are excited about the 95th birthday for Jerry Jansen this week.
[2573.98 --> 2579.64]  She's still a ball of energy and always has a quick time for a quick conversation, whether here at the
[2579.64 --> 2585.52]  church or when she's doing her laps up in Murrayville. We are thankful, Lord, for the healing of John
[2585.52 --> 2593.98]  Koning as he has received healing from his stage four melanoma. We come to this time of the year,
[2594.06 --> 2598.60]  Lord, where we present new office spares to the congregation. We are grateful, Lord, for the
[2598.60 --> 2603.12]  commitment of Paul Hummelman, Clary Clostroth, Alison Philpott, and Pearl DeHaan for putting their names
[2603.12 --> 2609.52]  forward for these leadership roles. We ask your blessing on the voting process in a couple weeks,
[2609.76 --> 2613.66]  and thank you, Lord, for the work and the service of the outgoing council members.
[2616.78 --> 2621.78]  Lord, as I look through the midweek memo and scan for prayer requests, it appears there are not many at this time.
[2621.78 --> 2628.02]  For that, we are grateful. However, we are well aware that there's much going on in our communities,
[2628.14 --> 2635.12]  whether here at church or in our communities outside of church. As I scan my own life, Lord, I'm witness to
[2635.12 --> 2641.34]  strained marriages, struggles with raising children, financial struggles, or job dissatisfaction.
[2642.50 --> 2648.26]  I see struggles with the mental health and gender confusion issues along with challenges navigating the strange
[2648.26 --> 2652.02]  world of social media and the internet for people of all ages.
[2653.54 --> 2657.14]  I hear struggles finding a partner to date and have a relationship with,
[2657.86 --> 2663.22]  and struggles trying to navigate the amount of news and media coming our way and trying to find the truth in it.
[2664.42 --> 2669.06]  This is going on in my world around me, so I'm sure it is for most of us here as well, Lord.
[2670.34 --> 2675.60]  The solution, Lord, is more of you in our lives as we ask your Holy Spirit to be relentless
[2675.60 --> 2682.92]  in making yourself known to us and to those around us, and because true peace is found in you.
[2684.80 --> 2689.34]  Thank you, Lord, for being the rock, for being consistent and truly reliable.
[2689.74 --> 2691.36]  You are our Savior and Comforter.
[2692.66 --> 2696.88]  We ask, Lord, that you encourage us and walk beside us this week as we go into the world,
[2696.96 --> 2699.08]  being a light for you in all our interactions.
[2699.08 --> 2706.46]  As we move on to the next step in this service, we ask that you would be with Josh as he brings the word to us this morning.
[2707.28 --> 2710.14]  We ask all these things in your mighty name alone, Lord.
[2710.42 --> 2710.76]  Amen.
[2729.08 --> 2738.64]  Good morning, everyone.
[2739.18 --> 2743.54]  We'll be reading from Romans 15, verses 14 to 33 today.
[2744.02 --> 2747.00]  And while you're opening your Bibles and your devices to the passage,
[2747.26 --> 2749.86]  I just want to say that as Kevin has highlighted,
[2750.02 --> 2754.44]  we are now on part 36 of this sermon series in Romans.
[2754.44 --> 2760.90]  And I don't know about you, but this year and a half in Romans has been really, really good.
[2761.70 --> 2768.02]  I think we all recognize this, but I just wanted to acknowledge how blessed we all are to have Chris and Kevin
[2768.02 --> 2770.52]  so expertly go through the book of Romans.
[2771.04 --> 2777.04]  And they were too humble to take it, but I think we all really need to thank them for all the work they've put
[2777.04 --> 2781.84]  in being good and faithful servants in their preaching in this period.
[2784.44 --> 2792.72]  They have highlighted the deep teachings of Romans about how devastating human sin is,
[2793.06 --> 2797.40]  God's redemption in Christ, justification, sanctification, glorification,
[2797.92 --> 2801.04]  the election of God's people, the work of the Holy Spirit in the church,
[2801.22 --> 2805.54]  and the practical working out of our faith in the commands to love God and neighbor.
[2805.54 --> 2810.04]  We have covered government, human sexuality, and even food laws.
[2811.26 --> 2814.52]  And that is why I want to say it is a privilege to partake in this series,
[2814.86 --> 2816.66]  even if it is the part where Paul says goodbye.
[2819.96 --> 2822.92]  Let's read Romans 15, verses 14 to 33.
[2822.92 --> 2831.04]  I myself am convinced, my brothers and sisters, that you yourselves are full of goodness,
[2831.62 --> 2834.82]  filled with the knowledge and competent to instruct one another.
[2835.64 --> 2839.18]  Yet I have written to you quite boldly on some points to remind you of them again.
[2840.54 --> 2844.80]  Because of the grace God gave me to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles,
[2844.80 --> 2848.86]  He gave me the priestly duty of proclaiming the gospel of God
[2848.86 --> 2851.92]  so that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God,
[2852.38 --> 2853.74]  sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
[2854.66 --> 2858.04]  Therefore I glorify in Christ Jesus in my service to God.
[2858.32 --> 2862.80]  I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me
[2862.80 --> 2866.28]  in leading the Gentiles to obey by what I have said and done,
[2866.60 --> 2870.26]  by the power of signs and wonders, through the power of the Spirit of God.
[2870.26 --> 2873.70]  So from Jerusalem all the way through to Illyricum,
[2874.08 --> 2876.80]  I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ.
[2877.22 --> 2882.10]  It has always been my ambition to preach the gospel where Christ was not known
[2882.10 --> 2885.14]  so that I would not be building on someone else's foundation.
[2885.76 --> 2886.76]  Rather, it is written,
[2887.34 --> 2890.14]  those who were not told about Him will see
[2890.14 --> 2892.42]  and those who have not heard will understand.
[2893.22 --> 2896.34]  This is why I have often been hindered from coming to you.
[2896.34 --> 2901.00]  But now that there is no more place for me to work in these regions,
[2901.24 --> 2904.28]  and since I have been longing for many years to visit you,
[2904.38 --> 2906.16]  I plan to do so when I go to Spain.
[2907.00 --> 2909.36]  I hope to see you while passing through
[2909.36 --> 2911.44]  and to have you assist me on my journey there,
[2911.88 --> 2914.30]  after I have enjoyed your company for a while.
[2915.00 --> 2917.54]  Now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem
[2917.54 --> 2919.22]  in the service of the Lord's people there.
[2919.88 --> 2923.66]  For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution
[2923.66 --> 2926.74]  for the poor among the Lord's people in Jerusalem.
[2927.76 --> 2930.74]  They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them.
[2931.02 --> 2933.98]  For if the Gentiles have shared in the Jews' spiritual blessings,
[2934.10 --> 2936.66]  they owe it to the Jews to share with them their material blessings.
[2937.52 --> 2939.58]  So, after I have completed this task
[2939.58 --> 2942.38]  and have made sure that they have received this contribution,
[2942.64 --> 2945.26]  I will go to Spain and visit you on the way.
[2945.90 --> 2947.28]  I know that when I come to you,
[2947.38 --> 2951.56]  I will come in the full measure of the blessings of Christ.
[2951.56 --> 2953.52]  I urge you, brothers and sisters,
[2954.02 --> 2957.24]  by your Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit
[2957.24 --> 2960.62]  to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me.
[2961.36 --> 2964.50]  Pray that I may be kept safe from the unbelievers in Judea
[2964.50 --> 2966.78]  and that the contribution I take to Jerusalem
[2966.78 --> 2969.66]  may be favorably received by the Lord's people there,
[2970.00 --> 2972.22]  so that I may come to you with joy,
[2972.66 --> 2976.06]  by God's will and in your company be refreshed.
[2976.50 --> 2977.84]  The God of peace be with you all.
[2978.50 --> 2978.70]  Amen.
[2978.70 --> 2978.82]  Amen.
[2981.56 --> 2986.22]  Paul starts this section by telling the church
[2986.22 --> 2988.64]  that he is satisfied that they are full of goodness
[2988.64 --> 2990.38]  and filled with all knowledge
[2990.38 --> 2992.02]  and able to instruct one another
[2992.02 --> 2995.40]  and that he has written to them boldly by way of reminder.
[2996.74 --> 2997.72]  What is Paul saying here?
[2998.06 --> 3000.50]  Well, in chapter 1, verse 8 of Romans,
[3000.96 --> 3004.84]  Paul says that he thanks God through Jesus Christ for all of them
[3004.84 --> 3007.90]  because their faith is proclaimed around the world.
[3007.90 --> 3013.12]  Paul is stoked with the news he hears of this church
[3013.12 --> 3016.88]  and he sends this letter not as a correction or as a gospel message
[3016.88 --> 3017.72]  they do not know,
[3017.98 --> 3023.44]  but rather as a joyful and encouraging reminder of what they already know.
[3024.44 --> 3027.62]  Just with his apostolic insights attached,
[3028.38 --> 3030.62]  this church understood one of the threads
[3030.62 --> 3033.84]  that Paul has been unraveling throughout this entire letter
[3033.84 --> 3037.32]  and it is the point that he makes in many of his letters
[3037.32 --> 3040.04]  and this is the big idea for today's sermon.
[3041.86 --> 3045.08]  The life of a Christian requires sacrifice.
[3046.84 --> 3049.88]  The life of a Christian requires sacrifice.
[3051.88 --> 3053.08]  Next question would be,
[3053.50 --> 3055.08]  what is it that I am sacrificing?
[3055.08 --> 3055.20]  Everything.
[3056.80 --> 3057.36]  Everything.
[3058.22 --> 3060.12]  With love and joy.
[3060.86 --> 3063.96]  And that joy Paul feels in this passage.
[3064.46 --> 3066.72]  Paul is joyful about the state of this church
[3066.72 --> 3069.64]  which leads him to express his other reasons
[3069.64 --> 3071.32]  for writing this letter to them.
[3071.80 --> 3074.78]  Paul knows he is the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles
[3074.78 --> 3077.90]  and he describes it further as a priestly duty
[3077.90 --> 3081.68]  and that he is offering the Gentiles to Christ.
[3081.68 --> 3086.44]  First, sacrifices by nature would be a sacrifice of your first fruits,
[3086.90 --> 3089.50]  your best, the things most valuable to you.
[3089.84 --> 3091.44]  Not the lamb who was damaged,
[3091.82 --> 3094.84]  but the firstborn lamb who was healthy and desired,
[3095.22 --> 3096.24]  flawless even.
[3097.18 --> 3099.90]  In the Old Testament there are two prominent types of sacrifices.
[3100.52 --> 3101.18]  One would make.
[3101.76 --> 3104.42]  A sin offering, which was to atone for sins,
[3104.82 --> 3106.02]  and a thanksgiving offering,
[3106.42 --> 3108.68]  which was an expression of gratitude towards God.
[3108.68 --> 3111.78]  Through our reading of Romans,
[3112.10 --> 3115.58]  we know that Paul does not think of this offering of the Gentiles to God
[3115.58 --> 3116.82]  as a sin offering.
[3117.28 --> 3119.82]  He is not doing this to atone for sins.
[3120.92 --> 3122.98]  Christ's sacrifice was the sin offering
[3122.98 --> 3124.54]  that ended all sin offerings.
[3124.84 --> 3126.08]  He was the perfect lamb,
[3126.48 --> 3127.92]  without blemish, flawless.
[3129.36 --> 3130.78]  But Paul has spoken already
[3130.78 --> 3133.98]  of how we are called to live as living sacrifices.
[3134.36 --> 3136.98]  Every part of us is to be placed on an altar
[3136.98 --> 3138.80]  daily again and again.
[3139.40 --> 3141.28]  Paul writes in Colossians 1.22,
[3141.96 --> 3143.66]  But now he has reconciled you
[3143.66 --> 3145.20]  by Christ's physical body
[3145.20 --> 3147.10]  through death to present you
[3147.10 --> 3149.22]  holy and blameless in his sight,
[3149.62 --> 3151.88]  without blemish and free from accusation.
[3153.00 --> 3156.14]  We are now a blameless lamb,
[3156.32 --> 3158.76]  giving of ourselves in thanksgiving to the Lord.
[3160.76 --> 3163.86]  Jesus appeared to Paul on the road to Damascus,
[3163.86 --> 3166.74]  which led Paul to realize that Christ was the Lord,
[3167.12 --> 3168.52]  and from there being baptized.
[3169.22 --> 3171.54]  Since then, Paul's entire ministry journey
[3171.54 --> 3174.76]  has been one giant thanksgiving offering to God
[3174.76 --> 3176.48]  for that undeserving gift.
[3177.62 --> 3179.92]  Every Gentile Paul has converted
[3179.92 --> 3182.26]  and through and brought to Christ
[3182.26 --> 3183.58]  is his first fruits.
[3184.00 --> 3186.34]  Every Greek or Jew that has come to the knowledge
[3186.34 --> 3188.84]  of their Savior is a fruit of gratitude.
[3188.84 --> 3192.02]  Every man or woman saved as a sacrifice
[3192.02 --> 3194.82]  given out of joy to the love of the one who saved him.
[3196.06 --> 3197.66]  Everything Paul has done,
[3198.56 --> 3200.94]  everything Paul has said in this letter,
[3201.38 --> 3202.42]  all of his encouragements
[3202.42 --> 3203.66]  and the outpouring of his heart
[3203.66 --> 3204.52]  to the Romans
[3204.52 --> 3207.96]  is not of a legalistic, intellectual elite.
[3208.34 --> 3210.00]  This is a man who has been given a gift
[3210.00 --> 3211.76]  he could never pay back.
[3212.38 --> 3214.12]  And so he does everything he can
[3214.12 --> 3215.68]  to live out that gratitude
[3215.68 --> 3218.10]  any way he can
[3218.10 --> 3220.14]  to the God who saved him.
[3220.98 --> 3223.66]  He is sacrificing everything
[3223.66 --> 3226.06]  as an offering of thanksgiving.
[3228.88 --> 3231.50]  This is what priests do.
[3232.30 --> 3234.24]  They present the sacrifices to the Lord
[3234.24 --> 3235.44]  and minister to the people.
[3236.12 --> 3239.04]  And he sees himself as a minister to the Gentiles.
[3239.70 --> 3241.74]  But not just Gentiles.
[3241.74 --> 3244.30]  Gentiles who have not yet heard
[3244.30 --> 3245.88]  the name of Jesus Christ.
[3246.52 --> 3247.64]  He does not want to build
[3247.64 --> 3249.08]  on someone else's foundation.
[3249.66 --> 3250.68]  His whole ministry
[3250.68 --> 3252.90]  has been to proclaim Jesus' name
[3252.90 --> 3254.62]  to as many people as possible.
[3255.96 --> 3257.74]  And Paul sees this expressed
[3257.74 --> 3259.84]  and prophesied in the Old Testament.
[3260.62 --> 3263.64]  Paul quotes Isaiah chapter 52 verse 15
[3263.64 --> 3266.08]  in Romans chapter 15 verse 22.
[3267.08 --> 3269.70]  Those who have never been told of him will see
[3269.70 --> 3272.02]  and those who have never heard will understand.
[3274.36 --> 3276.92]  This is the last verse of Isaiah 52.
[3277.62 --> 3279.10]  And it's talking about how people
[3279.10 --> 3280.96]  would come to know the servant of the Lord.
[3281.16 --> 3282.58]  Even if they didn't see him
[3282.58 --> 3284.04]  they would come to understand.
[3284.66 --> 3286.18]  Right after this is the famous
[3286.18 --> 3288.14]  Isaiah chapter 53 passage
[3288.14 --> 3289.06]  of the suffering servant.
[3289.76 --> 3291.52]  Who has believed our message
[3291.52 --> 3292.98]  and to whom has the arm of the Lord
[3292.98 --> 3293.56]  been revealed?
[3294.12 --> 3296.16]  He grew up before him like a tender shoot
[3296.16 --> 3298.20]  and like a root out of dry ground
[3298.20 --> 3299.68]  he had no beauty or majesty
[3299.68 --> 3300.82]  to attract us to him.
[3301.32 --> 3302.48]  Nothing in his appearance
[3302.48 --> 3303.64]  that we should desire him.
[3303.96 --> 3306.02]  He was despised and rejected by mankind.
[3306.58 --> 3307.46]  A man of suffering
[3307.46 --> 3308.70]  and familiar with pain.
[3309.08 --> 3310.82]  Like one from whom people hide their faces
[3310.82 --> 3311.96]  he was despised.
[3312.30 --> 3313.70]  And we held him in low esteem.
[3314.82 --> 3316.90]  Paul does not see himself as that figure.
[3317.34 --> 3318.26]  That would be Jesus.
[3319.02 --> 3320.64]  But Paul does see himself
[3320.64 --> 3322.42]  as the one who is telling the people
[3322.42 --> 3324.48]  in the prophecy about Christ
[3324.48 --> 3325.56]  in chapter 52.
[3326.30 --> 3328.30]  Those that were never told of him
[3328.30 --> 3329.40]  he is the reason
[3329.40 --> 3330.56]  they will hear and understand.
[3331.32 --> 3332.56]  Paul writing to the Romans
[3332.56 --> 3334.80]  right there is a fulfillment
[3334.80 --> 3336.02]  of that prophecy.
[3336.84 --> 3338.18]  We are a fulfillment
[3338.18 --> 3339.24]  of that prophecy.
[3340.08 --> 3340.84]  Everyone here
[3340.84 --> 3342.24]  never saw Jesus
[3342.24 --> 3344.26]  but believes and hears
[3344.26 --> 3345.06]  and understands.
[3346.38 --> 3347.78]  He is overjoyed
[3347.78 --> 3348.62]  in the faith
[3348.62 --> 3349.84]  of the Roman church
[3349.84 --> 3352.16]  because they are living proof
[3352.16 --> 3354.24]  of the truth written by Isaiah.
[3354.48 --> 3356.76]  In fact, chapter 52 of Isaiah
[3356.76 --> 3358.74]  is about how Israel refuses
[3358.74 --> 3360.34]  to see what God is doing
[3360.34 --> 3361.78]  and that the world will
[3361.78 --> 3364.50]  and the world will understand
[3364.50 --> 3365.60]  and not them.
[3366.00 --> 3367.90]  Which if you remember earlier in Romans
[3367.90 --> 3370.20]  was exactly what Paul said
[3370.20 --> 3370.80]  would happen
[3370.80 --> 3372.18]  in Romans chapter 11.
[3372.86 --> 3374.02]  Israel would be made jealous
[3374.02 --> 3375.20]  of the Gentiles' faith
[3375.20 --> 3377.24]  and eventually they would come to faith
[3377.24 --> 3377.86]  as a result.
[3377.86 --> 3380.32]  Now,
[3380.64 --> 3383.04]  everything we have learned so far
[3383.04 --> 3384.64]  leads us to the next section
[3384.64 --> 3386.44]  and this is what we have learned.
[3386.78 --> 3387.00]  One,
[3387.62 --> 3389.06]  that the Roman church is good
[3389.06 --> 3390.50]  and knowledgeable in the faith
[3390.50 --> 3391.62]  and two,
[3392.10 --> 3393.72]  Paul is a priest minister
[3393.72 --> 3394.68]  to Gentiles
[3394.68 --> 3395.68]  who have not yet heard
[3395.68 --> 3396.46]  the name of Christ.
[3397.70 --> 3398.84]  Paul is not focused
[3398.84 --> 3400.36]  on going to a place like Rome
[3400.36 --> 3401.16]  where he has nothing
[3401.16 --> 3401.82]  to teach them.
[3402.44 --> 3403.28]  This whole thing
[3403.28 --> 3404.24]  has been a reminder
[3404.24 --> 3406.66]  but there is a place
[3406.66 --> 3407.98]  just beyond Rome
[3407.98 --> 3409.24]  that he wants to get to.
[3410.56 --> 3411.00]  Spain.
[3412.56 --> 3413.00]  Spain,
[3413.16 --> 3413.92]  a whole land
[3413.92 --> 3414.94]  without a notable
[3414.94 --> 3416.28]  Jewish population
[3416.28 --> 3418.16]  unlike Greece and Rome.
[3418.40 --> 3419.40]  The population of Spain
[3419.40 --> 3420.72]  is mostly Gentile.
[3421.18 --> 3421.56]  For Paul,
[3421.66 --> 3422.28]  that is like being
[3422.28 --> 3423.34]  in an all-you-can-eat buffet
[3423.34 --> 3424.26]  except all the food
[3424.26 --> 3425.14]  is offered to God.
[3428.50 --> 3428.94]  Now,
[3429.04 --> 3429.94]  with all these names
[3429.94 --> 3430.56]  and locations
[3430.56 --> 3432.00]  and Paul talking about
[3432.00 --> 3433.06]  the places he wants to go
[3433.06 --> 3433.60]  and is going,
[3434.24 --> 3434.88]  I think it's time
[3434.88 --> 3435.80]  to look at some maps
[3435.80 --> 3436.48]  and for those
[3436.48 --> 3437.90]  not historically inclined,
[3438.16 --> 3438.72]  hang on there.
[3438.84 --> 3439.74]  This won't take that long.
[3440.74 --> 3440.94]  Okay.
[3441.46 --> 3441.76]  So,
[3441.94 --> 3442.60]  there's some maps up.
[3442.86 --> 3443.24]  Pay attention
[3443.24 --> 3444.08]  to the colored circles.
[3444.88 --> 3445.04]  So,
[3445.14 --> 3445.62]  Paul goes on
[3445.62 --> 3446.88]  four missionary journeys
[3446.88 --> 3448.36]  in his career.
[3448.96 --> 3449.90]  The first one,
[3450.02 --> 3450.74]  highlighted in yellow,
[3450.90 --> 3452.06]  he goes from Cyprus
[3452.06 --> 3453.48]  to Pamphylia
[3453.48 --> 3454.46]  to Galatia.
[3455.14 --> 3456.24]  That second one,
[3456.30 --> 3457.56]  it says Lycia there.
[3458.20 --> 3459.48]  Pamphylia wasn't on the map
[3459.48 --> 3460.08]  so,
[3460.88 --> 3461.74]  that's Pamphylia.
[3462.16 --> 3462.30]  Just,
[3462.58 --> 3462.72]  yeah.
[3462.72 --> 3464.64]  The next one
[3464.64 --> 3465.22]  is in pink.
[3466.24 --> 3467.06]  Paul then goes
[3467.06 --> 3467.86]  from Galatia
[3467.86 --> 3468.88]  to Macedonia
[3468.88 --> 3470.08]  and then Achaia.
[3470.84 --> 3471.54]  And the next,
[3472.02 --> 3473.16]  his third missionary journey,
[3473.58 --> 3474.76]  he goes from Galatia
[3474.76 --> 3475.70]  to Asia
[3475.70 --> 3476.78]  to Macedonia
[3476.78 --> 3477.62]  to Achaia
[3477.62 --> 3478.30]  and then back
[3478.30 --> 3478.98]  to Jerusalem
[3478.98 --> 3480.16]  where we are reading.
[3480.60 --> 3480.92]  Which,
[3481.10 --> 3481.88]  as we read in Romans,
[3481.96 --> 3483.16]  is where he is currently heading
[3483.16 --> 3485.12]  and why he takes the Roman,
[3485.28 --> 3486.28]  asks the Roman church
[3486.28 --> 3486.78]  for money
[3486.78 --> 3487.36]  and prayer.
[3487.36 --> 3488.44]  And then lastly,
[3488.64 --> 3489.22]  in black,
[3489.56 --> 3490.26]  we see that
[3490.26 --> 3491.62]  the fourth missionary journey,
[3491.76 --> 3492.66]  which is not recorded
[3492.66 --> 3493.40]  in the Bible,
[3493.52 --> 3494.14]  the book of Acts,
[3494.50 --> 3495.38]  but is referred to
[3495.38 --> 3496.06]  in the epistles
[3496.06 --> 3496.98]  and in church history.
[3497.46 --> 3498.74]  Starts with his imprisonment
[3498.74 --> 3499.56]  in Caesarea
[3499.56 --> 3501.28]  where he appeals to Caesar
[3501.28 --> 3502.66]  and is then brought to Rome
[3502.66 --> 3503.68]  where his boat
[3503.68 --> 3504.34]  hits a storm
[3504.34 --> 3505.64]  and ship crashes
[3505.64 --> 3506.58]  on the island of Malta
[3506.58 --> 3507.90]  and they make their way
[3507.90 --> 3508.64]  to Rome
[3508.64 --> 3509.30]  where he is put
[3509.30 --> 3510.02]  under house arrest.
[3510.50 --> 3511.54]  He then goes from Rome
[3511.54 --> 3512.10]  to Spain,
[3512.34 --> 3513.36]  which is not on the map,
[3513.44 --> 3514.10]  so there's an arrow
[3514.10 --> 3515.34]  pointing to where Spain is,
[3515.34 --> 3516.68]  and then Crete
[3516.68 --> 3517.58]  and then Asia
[3517.58 --> 3518.48]  and then Achaia
[3518.48 --> 3519.34]  and Macedonia.
[3520.26 --> 3520.82]  And lastly,
[3521.18 --> 3521.94]  one more map.
[3522.08 --> 3522.76]  We're just about done.
[3523.54 --> 3524.30]  This is a map
[3524.30 --> 3525.10]  of the total reach
[3525.10 --> 3525.82]  of Christianity
[3525.82 --> 3526.92]  by the second century,
[3527.02 --> 3527.82]  the highlighted part
[3527.82 --> 3528.70]  around the Mediterranean.
[3529.46 --> 3530.56]  There's two sections
[3530.56 --> 3531.70]  which are hard to see
[3531.70 --> 3532.86]  and being colorblind,
[3532.94 --> 3533.30]  I've been told
[3533.30 --> 3534.16]  that the middle section
[3534.16 --> 3534.72]  is green,
[3535.24 --> 3537.92]  but you'll probably
[3537.92 --> 3538.64]  see better than me.
[3540.02 --> 3542.20]  The first smaller area
[3542.20 --> 3542.96]  is the place
[3542.96 --> 3543.60]  where Christianity
[3543.60 --> 3544.80]  got in the first century.
[3545.34 --> 3545.78]  And if you look,
[3545.86 --> 3546.70]  that's all the places
[3546.70 --> 3547.38]  Paul went
[3547.38 --> 3548.36]  by the time he died.
[3549.06 --> 3550.34]  And that bigger area,
[3550.60 --> 3551.52]  the darker area,
[3551.98 --> 3553.40]  is where Christianity
[3553.40 --> 3554.06]  got by the end
[3554.06 --> 3554.96]  of the second century.
[3555.22 --> 3555.78]  And if you look,
[3556.30 --> 3557.54]  Spain is one
[3557.54 --> 3558.28]  of those places,
[3558.80 --> 3559.30]  which means
[3559.30 --> 3560.28]  someone got there.
[3561.60 --> 3562.08]  And look,
[3562.62 --> 3564.88]  we don't know exactly
[3564.88 --> 3566.14]  if he made it to Spain
[3566.14 --> 3567.28]  because it's not recorded.
[3567.64 --> 3568.36]  But considering
[3568.36 --> 3569.64]  the success of the church
[3569.64 --> 3571.48]  and that fact
[3571.48 --> 3572.08]  that many people
[3572.08 --> 3572.92]  suspect he did,
[3572.92 --> 3576.66]  we could very well think
[3576.66 --> 3577.10]  either him
[3577.10 --> 3577.92]  or his disciples
[3577.92 --> 3578.52]  got there.
[3578.96 --> 3580.36]  But it just wasn't
[3580.36 --> 3581.34]  recorded in the Bible
[3581.34 --> 3582.22]  because God
[3582.22 --> 3582.98]  didn't want it there.
[3583.80 --> 3584.80]  As I mentioned before,
[3585.92 --> 3586.48]  sorry,
[3587.36 --> 3588.54]  why is Spain important?
[3589.00 --> 3589.86]  Why does Paul
[3589.86 --> 3591.56]  want to get to Spain?
[3591.56 --> 3593.92]  As I mentioned before,
[3594.08 --> 3594.88]  it has a majority
[3594.88 --> 3595.86]  Gentile population,
[3596.02 --> 3597.06]  which is a perfect match
[3597.06 --> 3598.08]  for Paul's ministry calling.
[3598.84 --> 3599.44]  But there are
[3599.44 --> 3600.24]  a few other reasons.
[3600.66 --> 3601.30]  The other reason
[3601.30 --> 3602.30]  is that for the Old Testament
[3602.30 --> 3603.42]  people of the Middle East,
[3603.82 --> 3604.56]  the coast of Spain
[3604.56 --> 3606.34]  was considered
[3606.34 --> 3607.68]  the end of the earth,
[3608.22 --> 3608.68]  specifically,
[3608.94 --> 3610.04]  a city named Tarshish,
[3610.38 --> 3610.66]  which,
[3610.80 --> 3611.20]  if you remember
[3611.20 --> 3612.04]  from the book of Jonah,
[3612.38 --> 3612.90]  we learned
[3612.90 --> 3613.56]  was the place
[3613.56 --> 3614.72]  Jonah wanted to flee to
[3614.72 --> 3615.38]  because it was
[3615.38 --> 3616.38]  the farthest place
[3616.38 --> 3617.06]  from Jerusalem,
[3617.52 --> 3619.22]  which we all today know
[3619.22 --> 3620.44]  is not actually
[3620.44 --> 3621.26]  the farthest place
[3621.26 --> 3621.78]  from Jerusalem.
[3622.16 --> 3623.04]  It's obviously
[3623.04 --> 3624.02]  the Gambier Islands
[3624.02 --> 3625.00]  and French Polynesia,
[3625.10 --> 3628.30]  which is 11,591 kilometers away.
[3630.84 --> 3632.20]  But for the OT people,
[3632.50 --> 3633.44]  the Old Testament people,
[3633.64 --> 3634.84]  Spain was the ends
[3634.84 --> 3635.32]  of the earth.
[3636.16 --> 3636.42]  Now,
[3636.76 --> 3637.68]  we must ask,
[3638.14 --> 3639.32]  why is that getting
[3639.32 --> 3640.32]  to the ends of the earth
[3640.32 --> 3640.80]  matters?
[3642.50 --> 3642.98]  Now,
[3643.04 --> 3644.04]  converting as many people
[3644.04 --> 3644.60]  as possible
[3644.60 --> 3645.98]  is the goal of our faith
[3645.98 --> 3647.72]  and Christ's sacrifice.
[3648.28 --> 3649.32]  But Paul would have,
[3649.68 --> 3650.34]  could have also
[3650.34 --> 3651.06]  gone to Europe
[3651.06 --> 3651.76]  or Asia,
[3652.10 --> 3652.72]  but no,
[3652.78 --> 3653.58]  he went to Spain.
[3654.00 --> 3654.34]  Why?
[3656.50 --> 3656.92]  Well,
[3657.06 --> 3657.70]  because God
[3657.70 --> 3658.78]  commanded them to.
[3659.56 --> 3660.40]  Simple as that.
[3661.06 --> 3662.30]  The epistle to the Romans,
[3662.58 --> 3663.52]  like most of the epistles,
[3663.60 --> 3664.46]  was written by Paul
[3664.46 --> 3665.22]  during the events
[3665.22 --> 3666.42]  recorded in the book of Acts.
[3666.84 --> 3667.76]  The book of Acts
[3667.76 --> 3668.82]  records the explosion
[3668.82 --> 3669.38]  of the church
[3669.38 --> 3670.16]  out of Jerusalem
[3670.16 --> 3671.86]  into the world at large.
[3672.22 --> 3673.52]  But in chapter 1 of Acts,
[3673.62 --> 3674.70]  we see Jesus
[3674.70 --> 3675.60]  at his ascension
[3675.60 --> 3676.32]  give the disciples
[3676.32 --> 3677.60]  one final direction.
[3677.60 --> 3679.16]  And it goes like this
[3679.16 --> 3679.80]  in Acts 1,
[3679.92 --> 3681.30]  verse 6 to 8.
[3681.94 --> 3682.96]  Then they gathered around him
[3682.96 --> 3683.50]  and asked him,
[3683.66 --> 3683.82]  Lord,
[3684.20 --> 3685.28]  are you at this time
[3685.28 --> 3685.96]  going to restore
[3685.96 --> 3686.84]  the kingdom of Israel?
[3687.32 --> 3688.06]  He said to them,
[3688.12 --> 3688.70]  it is not for you
[3688.70 --> 3689.52]  to know the times
[3689.52 --> 3690.14]  or the dates
[3690.14 --> 3690.94]  the Father has set
[3690.94 --> 3691.82]  by his own authority,
[3691.82 --> 3693.44]  but you will receive power
[3693.44 --> 3694.24]  when the Holy Spirit
[3694.24 --> 3694.90]  comes to you
[3694.90 --> 3696.18]  and you will be my witness
[3696.18 --> 3697.08]  in Jerusalem,
[3697.58 --> 3698.24]  in all Judea
[3698.24 --> 3698.88]  and Samaria
[3698.88 --> 3700.08]  and to the ends
[3700.08 --> 3700.90]  of the earth.
[3701.66 --> 3702.38]  To the ends
[3702.38 --> 3703.14]  of the earth.
[3705.46 --> 3707.10]  Paul sees his work
[3707.10 --> 3708.56]  as with all of the disciples
[3708.56 --> 3710.16]  as the command of Christ
[3710.16 --> 3711.28]  to bring the name
[3711.28 --> 3712.24]  of Jesus Christ
[3712.24 --> 3713.56]  and the good news
[3713.56 --> 3714.38]  to the ends
[3714.38 --> 3715.08]  of the earth.
[3715.54 --> 3716.30]  And for them
[3716.30 --> 3717.52]  that meant Spain.
[3718.18 --> 3719.02]  So Paul is doing
[3719.02 --> 3720.42]  everything in his power
[3720.42 --> 3721.32]  and the power
[3721.32 --> 3722.04]  of the Holy Spirit
[3722.04 --> 3722.66]  to get there
[3722.66 --> 3724.36]  as fast as possible.
[3725.14 --> 3726.30]  Willing to sacrifice
[3726.30 --> 3727.96]  everything to do it.
[3728.62 --> 3729.20]  And we see
[3729.20 --> 3729.56]  at the end
[3729.56 --> 3730.26]  of the book of Acts
[3730.26 --> 3731.28]  that he does make it
[3731.28 --> 3731.68]  to Rome.
[3731.88 --> 3733.10]  That long-awaited meeting
[3733.10 --> 3734.30]  of the Roman church
[3734.30 --> 3735.54]  and Paul does happen.
[3736.08 --> 3736.62]  And from there
[3736.62 --> 3738.26]  he is only a short trip
[3738.26 --> 3739.38]  from completing
[3739.38 --> 3740.92]  the final call of Christ.
[3743.02 --> 3744.64]  In between this letter
[3744.64 --> 3745.74]  and him getting to Rome
[3745.74 --> 3746.74]  he must first travel
[3746.74 --> 3747.40]  to Jerusalem
[3747.40 --> 3749.06]  to bring a deposit of money
[3749.06 --> 3750.18]  from the Greek churches
[3750.18 --> 3751.40]  to the poor
[3751.40 --> 3752.50]  in the Jerusalem church.
[3753.06 --> 3753.84]  And he asks
[3753.84 --> 3754.48]  the Roman church
[3754.48 --> 3755.26]  to support them
[3755.26 --> 3756.26]  and this is what he says.
[3756.98 --> 3757.58]  They were pleased
[3757.58 --> 3758.16]  to do it
[3758.16 --> 3758.78]  and indeed
[3758.78 --> 3760.08]  they owe it to them.
[3760.08 --> 3761.54]  For if the Gentiles
[3761.54 --> 3762.46]  have shared in the Jews
[3762.46 --> 3763.34]  spiritual blessings
[3763.34 --> 3764.94]  they owe it to the Jews
[3764.94 --> 3765.80]  to share with them
[3765.80 --> 3766.78]  their material blessings.
[3767.72 --> 3768.60]  Paul is saying
[3768.60 --> 3769.36]  that since redemption
[3769.36 --> 3770.44]  came from the Jews
[3770.44 --> 3771.56]  to the Gentiles
[3771.56 --> 3772.78]  that they ought to
[3772.78 --> 3774.16]  materially support the church.
[3775.22 --> 3776.42]  Now this passage
[3776.42 --> 3777.54]  often gets misunderstood
[3777.54 --> 3778.90]  as a way
[3778.90 --> 3779.66]  to funnel money
[3779.66 --> 3780.66]  to the state of Israel.
[3781.12 --> 3782.38]  That Christians owe a debt
[3782.38 --> 3783.40]  and should for the rest
[3783.40 --> 3783.88]  of history
[3783.88 --> 3784.48]  send money
[3784.48 --> 3785.78]  for whatever government
[3785.78 --> 3787.02]  runs Israel.
[3787.02 --> 3789.06]  that simply
[3789.06 --> 3790.16]  isn't the case.
[3791.02 --> 3792.08]  There is nothing wrong
[3792.08 --> 3793.50]  with helping other nations.
[3794.14 --> 3794.70]  We should
[3794.70 --> 3796.54]  but Paul is specifically
[3796.54 --> 3798.16]  asking politely
[3798.16 --> 3799.30]  that they help
[3799.30 --> 3800.68]  support the poor
[3800.68 --> 3801.70]  among the saints
[3801.70 --> 3802.42]  in Jerusalem.
[3803.10 --> 3803.88]  He is asking
[3803.88 --> 3804.88]  that the church in Rome
[3804.88 --> 3805.88]  which at this point
[3805.88 --> 3806.64]  is both faithful
[3806.64 --> 3808.14]  and monetarily doing well
[3808.14 --> 3809.30]  to help the church
[3809.30 --> 3810.18]  that is in Jerusalem
[3810.18 --> 3811.40]  right now
[3811.40 --> 3812.60]  and is being persecuted
[3812.60 --> 3813.94]  by Paul's old friends
[3813.94 --> 3814.48]  back home.
[3814.48 --> 3816.26]  And Paul is saying
[3816.26 --> 3817.22]  that because of the faith
[3817.22 --> 3818.24]  you now have
[3818.24 --> 3819.58]  is because of their
[3819.58 --> 3821.02]  suffering and willingness
[3821.02 --> 3822.82]  to endure the pain
[3822.82 --> 3823.52]  of persecution
[3823.52 --> 3825.34]  and you should help them
[3825.34 --> 3826.58]  from your safe harbor
[3826.58 --> 3827.50]  so far away
[3827.50 --> 3829.16]  in any way you can.
[3830.10 --> 3831.24]  The big idea
[3831.24 --> 3832.22]  is shown here.
[3832.76 --> 3833.86]  He calls these Christians
[3833.86 --> 3834.84]  to sacrifice
[3834.84 --> 3837.14]  to give everything.
[3839.78 --> 3841.08]  So what I'm really saying
[3841.08 --> 3841.96]  is that next year
[3841.96 --> 3843.50]  when the Mexico team
[3843.50 --> 3844.22]  is fundraising
[3844.22 --> 3845.02]  for money
[3845.02 --> 3846.46]  we all need to empty
[3846.46 --> 3847.16]  our bank accounts
[3847.16 --> 3847.94]  and give it to Brandon.
[3850.54 --> 3851.82]  I say that in jest.
[3852.48 --> 3852.96]  To be frank
[3852.96 --> 3853.66]  I believe that
[3853.66 --> 3854.60]  if Paul saw
[3854.60 --> 3855.32]  the sacrifices
[3855.32 --> 3856.12]  many of the members
[3856.12 --> 3856.94]  of this church made
[3856.94 --> 3858.52]  he would be commending you
[3858.52 --> 3859.20]  all the same way
[3859.20 --> 3860.06]  he does the Romans.
[3862.64 --> 3864.50]  Paul specifically calls
[3864.50 --> 3865.50]  for prayer
[3865.50 --> 3867.34]  in the next verse
[3867.34 --> 3868.32]  in verse 30.
[3868.46 --> 3869.22]  I urge you
[3869.22 --> 3870.14]  brothers and sisters
[3870.14 --> 3872.16]  by the Lord Jesus Christ
[3872.16 --> 3873.30]  and by the love
[3873.30 --> 3874.10]  of the Holy Spirit
[3874.10 --> 3875.52]  to join me
[3875.52 --> 3876.32]  in the struggle
[3876.32 --> 3877.14]  of praying
[3877.14 --> 3879.60]  to God for me.
[3880.18 --> 3881.12]  Paul is asking
[3881.12 --> 3881.76]  for prayer
[3881.76 --> 3882.98]  that he safely
[3882.98 --> 3883.62]  makes it
[3883.62 --> 3884.14]  with the money
[3884.14 --> 3884.86]  to the church
[3884.86 --> 3886.74]  and that his old friends
[3886.74 --> 3887.74]  and the Judeans
[3887.74 --> 3888.62]  that have been trying
[3888.62 --> 3889.20]  to get him
[3889.20 --> 3890.02]  are thwarted.
[3890.68 --> 3891.26]  And if we read
[3891.26 --> 3891.88]  the book of Acts
[3891.88 --> 3892.82]  we see that yes
[3892.82 --> 3894.10]  he does make it
[3894.10 --> 3894.64]  with the money.
[3895.34 --> 3895.76]  Does he make
[3895.76 --> 3896.96]  he makes it back
[3896.96 --> 3897.46]  to Jerusalem?
[3897.60 --> 3898.58]  Does he make it safely?
[3899.14 --> 3899.52]  No.
[3901.12 --> 3902.12]  But that's besides
[3902.12 --> 3902.64]  the point.
[3903.24 --> 3903.96]  Was there a failed
[3903.96 --> 3905.00]  assassination attempt
[3905.00 --> 3905.64]  a shipwreck
[3905.64 --> 3906.52]  a couple of near-death
[3906.52 --> 3907.00]  beatings
[3907.00 --> 3907.78]  and multiple groups
[3907.78 --> 3908.20]  of people?
[3908.60 --> 3909.36]  Some brush-ups
[3909.36 --> 3909.98]  with some snakes
[3909.98 --> 3910.44]  on the way?
[3910.98 --> 3911.38]  Yes.
[3911.70 --> 3912.56]  But the upside
[3912.56 --> 3913.86]  was the travel cost
[3913.86 --> 3914.68]  to Rome was zero
[3914.68 --> 3915.28]  on the account
[3915.28 --> 3916.18]  of him being a prisoner
[3916.18 --> 3917.08]  on a slave ship.
[3917.08 --> 3922.42]  Just like these events
[3922.42 --> 3923.20]  were extraordinary
[3923.20 --> 3924.92]  so is Paul's call
[3924.92 --> 3925.52]  for prayer
[3925.52 --> 3926.54]  in this passage.
[3927.08 --> 3928.20]  He does not just
[3928.20 --> 3929.20]  ask for prayer.
[3929.86 --> 3930.52]  He says that
[3930.52 --> 3931.72]  by the Lord Jesus Christ
[3931.72 --> 3932.40]  and by the love
[3932.40 --> 3933.16]  of the Holy Spirit
[3933.16 --> 3935.02]  join me in the struggle
[3935.02 --> 3936.64]  by praying to God
[3936.64 --> 3937.06]  for me.
[3937.66 --> 3938.64]  Paul uses a word
[3938.64 --> 3939.02]  for prayer
[3939.02 --> 3939.68]  in this passage
[3939.68 --> 3940.56]  that is not used
[3940.56 --> 3941.46]  anywhere else
[3941.46 --> 3942.46]  in the New Testament.
[3943.62 --> 3944.70]  This word is related
[3944.70 --> 3945.70]  to wrestling terms
[3945.70 --> 3946.30]  in Greek.
[3946.30 --> 3948.28]  It expresses ideas
[3948.28 --> 3949.28]  like energetic
[3949.28 --> 3950.48]  diligence
[3950.48 --> 3951.60]  earnestness.
[3952.14 --> 3952.72]  He does not just
[3952.72 --> 3953.70]  ask us to pray
[3953.70 --> 3954.44]  what we think
[3954.44 --> 3955.62]  or when we think
[3955.62 --> 3956.24]  about praying
[3956.24 --> 3957.78]  or practice prayer
[3957.78 --> 3958.58]  but he asks us
[3958.58 --> 3959.40]  to practice prayer
[3959.40 --> 3960.42]  like a martial artist
[3960.42 --> 3962.42]  practicing his technique
[3962.42 --> 3964.18]  with the same focus
[3964.18 --> 3964.96]  and time spent
[3964.96 --> 3965.40]  on training
[3965.40 --> 3966.20]  for a big fight.
[3966.86 --> 3967.38]  He's asking
[3967.38 --> 3968.34]  for the Church of Rome
[3968.34 --> 3969.52]  to be his corner men
[3969.52 --> 3970.92]  in the boxing match
[3970.92 --> 3971.80]  against the forces
[3971.80 --> 3972.34]  of evil
[3972.34 --> 3974.74]  which are fighting
[3974.74 --> 3976.00]  to oppose the church.
[3976.30 --> 3977.64]  And what you see
[3977.64 --> 3978.36]  in the book of Acts
[3978.36 --> 3979.50]  is that every authority
[3979.50 --> 3980.56]  every human
[3980.56 --> 3981.88]  and even the earth
[3981.88 --> 3983.44]  tries to stop Paul
[3983.44 --> 3984.22]  from making it
[3984.22 --> 3984.82]  to Jerusalem.
[3985.92 --> 3987.28]  And yet because
[3987.28 --> 3988.82]  of Jesus Christ
[3988.82 --> 3990.42]  the Holy Spirit
[3990.42 --> 3991.34]  and the prayers
[3991.34 --> 3991.92]  of the saints
[3991.92 --> 3992.48]  in Rome
[3992.48 --> 3993.72]  he makes it.
[3995.08 --> 3996.50]  You and I
[3996.50 --> 3997.02]  are called
[3997.02 --> 3998.08]  to pray like this.
[3998.70 --> 4000.00]  God invites us
[4000.00 --> 4001.24]  to pray like this.
[4001.44 --> 4002.54]  Just like he invited
[4002.54 --> 4003.32]  Jacob to wrestle
[4003.32 --> 4004.24]  with him all night
[4004.24 --> 4005.00]  until dawn
[4005.00 --> 4006.10]  when the blessing came.
[4006.50 --> 4008.80]  So that he calls us
[4008.80 --> 4009.26]  to pray
[4009.26 --> 4010.66]  with that same type
[4010.66 --> 4011.16]  of fervor.
[4011.54 --> 4012.42]  The same type
[4012.42 --> 4012.96]  of intensity.
[4013.44 --> 4014.24]  Just like Jacob
[4014.24 --> 4015.10]  wrestled with God
[4015.10 --> 4016.58]  and asked for blessing.
[4017.12 --> 4018.04]  God is asking us
[4018.04 --> 4019.00]  to stay up all night
[4019.00 --> 4019.48]  with him
[4019.48 --> 4020.98]  and ask him
[4020.98 --> 4021.60]  for blessing.
[4022.26 --> 4023.28]  God is calling us
[4023.28 --> 4024.54]  to ask the impossible,
[4025.08 --> 4025.88]  the miraculous,
[4026.34 --> 4027.06]  the incredible.
[4027.86 --> 4028.76]  You want to see
[4028.76 --> 4029.70]  the lame walk?
[4030.14 --> 4030.92]  You want to see
[4030.92 --> 4031.82]  the blind see?
[4032.60 --> 4033.26]  You want to see
[4033.26 --> 4034.42]  starvation end?
[4034.94 --> 4035.64]  Do you want to see
[4035.64 --> 4036.54]  the gifts of the Spirit?
[4037.12 --> 4037.76]  Do you want to see
[4037.76 --> 4039.04]  nations have peace?
[4039.48 --> 4040.26]  Do you want to see
[4040.26 --> 4041.28]  people believe?
[4042.14 --> 4042.96]  Then pray
[4042.96 --> 4044.04]  like a warrior
[4044.04 --> 4045.18]  to the one
[4045.18 --> 4046.04]  who makes men
[4046.04 --> 4047.14]  walk and see.
[4047.48 --> 4048.14]  To the one
[4048.14 --> 4048.96]  who provides
[4048.96 --> 4049.74]  both food
[4049.74 --> 4050.78]  and spirit.
[4051.50 --> 4052.56]  Pray to the King
[4052.56 --> 4053.88]  who brings peace
[4053.88 --> 4055.60]  and gives faith.
[4055.60 --> 4060.90]  I joked earlier
[4060.90 --> 4062.00]  about the Mexico
[4062.00 --> 4062.72]  missions team
[4062.72 --> 4064.10]  but as far as
[4064.10 --> 4064.72]  how this passage
[4064.72 --> 4065.44]  relates to us,
[4065.80 --> 4066.76]  the Mexico missions team
[4066.76 --> 4067.48]  is one example
[4067.48 --> 4068.24]  of how this
[4068.24 --> 4069.90]  relates to our church,
[4070.04 --> 4070.74]  this context.
[4071.48 --> 4073.02]  We send our missionaries
[4073.02 --> 4074.04]  not like Paul
[4074.04 --> 4074.54]  who was building
[4074.54 --> 4074.92]  a foundation
[4074.92 --> 4075.78]  where none have gone
[4075.78 --> 4077.54]  but we every time
[4077.54 --> 4078.36]  we go are building
[4078.36 --> 4078.98]  on the foundation
[4078.98 --> 4079.64]  that has been laid
[4079.64 --> 4080.36]  the year before.
[4081.98 --> 4082.88]  And when we send
[4082.88 --> 4083.50]  out our teams
[4083.50 --> 4084.54]  with a commissioning prayer
[4084.54 --> 4085.68]  and the members
[4085.68 --> 4086.26]  of our church
[4086.26 --> 4087.50]  pray over that week
[4087.50 --> 4087.86]  or two
[4087.86 --> 4088.58]  that they are gone
[4088.58 --> 4090.24]  but in the face
[4090.24 --> 4090.62]  of missions
[4090.62 --> 4091.44]  Paul is asking us
[4091.44 --> 4092.46]  not to just pray
[4092.46 --> 4093.76]  any old prayers
[4093.76 --> 4095.06]  but to be their
[4095.06 --> 4095.72]  corner men
[4095.72 --> 4096.48]  in the fight.
[4097.06 --> 4098.14]  He asks the church
[4098.14 --> 4098.56]  of Rome
[4098.56 --> 4099.94]  to strive together
[4099.94 --> 4100.36]  with him.
[4100.94 --> 4101.76]  We need to sacrifice
[4101.76 --> 4103.68]  together in earnest
[4103.68 --> 4104.56]  and energetic
[4104.56 --> 4106.16]  diligent prayer
[4106.16 --> 4106.94]  for each other.
[4107.30 --> 4108.22]  For our team
[4108.22 --> 4108.96]  that goes and does
[4108.96 --> 4109.90]  the work of the Holy Spirit
[4109.90 --> 4111.22]  just as the Roman church
[4111.22 --> 4111.98]  prayed and provided
[4111.98 --> 4112.46]  for the saints
[4112.46 --> 4113.00]  in Jerusalem.
[4113.00 --> 4114.76]  So too does
[4114.76 --> 4115.64]  the church of Langley
[4115.64 --> 4116.58]  need to pray
[4116.58 --> 4117.12]  for the church
[4117.12 --> 4117.68]  of Tijuana.
[4118.72 --> 4119.48]  Like the church
[4119.48 --> 4119.88]  of Rome
[4119.88 --> 4120.68]  we are called
[4120.68 --> 4121.62]  to sacrifice
[4121.62 --> 4122.94]  everything.
[4125.08 --> 4125.72]  But there are
[4125.72 --> 4126.24]  more avenues
[4126.24 --> 4126.96]  for us to obey
[4126.96 --> 4127.34]  God
[4127.34 --> 4128.78]  in this
[4128.78 --> 4129.38]  to provide
[4129.38 --> 4129.98]  and pray.
[4131.18 --> 4131.58]  The people
[4131.58 --> 4132.34]  that come to my mind
[4132.34 --> 4133.26]  when I think of missions
[4133.26 --> 4134.84]  in relation to this church
[4134.84 --> 4135.96]  are Jody and Uriel
[4135.96 --> 4137.98]  and their men's
[4137.98 --> 4139.02]  rehab ministry.
[4139.46 --> 4140.40]  Abilino and Maria
[4140.40 --> 4141.36]  in East Tijuana.
[4142.00 --> 4142.96]  Tim and Charity Johnson
[4142.96 --> 4143.64]  with name
[4143.64 --> 4144.50]  Gary Rusma
[4144.50 --> 4145.38]  with seafarers
[4145.38 --> 4146.44]  and Todd Statham
[4146.44 --> 4147.48]  doing campus ministries
[4147.48 --> 4148.08]  in Okanagan.
[4148.94 --> 4149.60]  These people
[4149.60 --> 4150.04]  have answered
[4150.04 --> 4150.68]  the call of God
[4150.68 --> 4152.04]  to go and sacrifice
[4152.04 --> 4152.80]  everything
[4152.80 --> 4154.12]  for the sake of ministry
[4154.12 --> 4155.08]  out there
[4155.08 --> 4156.10]  where we are not.
[4156.48 --> 4156.98]  And that means
[4156.98 --> 4158.40]  that they don't always
[4158.40 --> 4159.12]  have the resources
[4159.12 --> 4159.62]  we do
[4159.62 --> 4161.84]  when we do ministry.
[4162.18 --> 4163.12]  And so we are called
[4163.12 --> 4163.78]  to sacrifice
[4163.78 --> 4164.44]  everything
[4164.44 --> 4165.38]  for their sake
[4165.38 --> 4166.56]  as they sacrifice
[4166.56 --> 4167.26]  everything
[4167.26 --> 4167.88]  for the ones
[4167.88 --> 4168.74]  they are reaching to.
[4169.60 --> 4170.44]  We are called
[4170.44 --> 4171.10]  to pray
[4171.10 --> 4171.96]  without ceasing
[4171.96 --> 4173.18]  with dedication
[4173.18 --> 4174.18]  energetically
[4174.18 --> 4175.12]  and diligently
[4175.12 --> 4178.68]  for their sake
[4178.68 --> 4179.50]  as they are
[4179.50 --> 4179.94]  the hands
[4179.94 --> 4180.42]  and feet
[4180.42 --> 4180.92]  of Christ
[4180.92 --> 4181.62]  out there.
[4182.68 --> 4183.36]  But we are not
[4183.36 --> 4183.72]  just called
[4183.72 --> 4184.28]  to pray
[4184.28 --> 4184.90]  and sacrifice
[4184.90 --> 4185.54]  in this way
[4185.54 --> 4186.14]  for our own
[4186.14 --> 4186.78]  missions teams
[4186.78 --> 4187.82]  but for the work
[4187.82 --> 4188.22]  that missions
[4188.22 --> 4188.56]  are doing
[4188.56 --> 4189.36]  throughout the world.
[4189.92 --> 4191.06]  We are to join
[4191.06 --> 4191.56]  with them
[4191.56 --> 4192.88]  from our safe harbors
[4192.88 --> 4193.76]  so far away
[4193.76 --> 4195.20]  any way we can
[4195.20 --> 4196.10]  material
[4196.10 --> 4196.96]  and prayer.
[4196.96 --> 4198.42]  And so we help
[4198.42 --> 4198.88]  people
[4198.88 --> 4199.72]  missionaries
[4199.72 --> 4201.06]  through our tithe
[4201.06 --> 4201.98]  and in other times
[4201.98 --> 4202.48]  and places
[4202.48 --> 4204.00]  we pray for the church
[4204.00 --> 4204.52]  in China
[4204.52 --> 4205.86]  and in Russia
[4205.86 --> 4207.16]  and in the Middle East
[4207.16 --> 4207.70]  who are faced
[4207.70 --> 4208.28]  persecution.
[4211.08 --> 4211.56]  However
[4211.56 --> 4212.40]  to think
[4212.40 --> 4212.96]  that there are
[4212.96 --> 4213.40]  two types
[4213.40 --> 4213.96]  of Christians
[4213.96 --> 4215.10]  those who provide
[4215.10 --> 4215.52]  and pray
[4215.52 --> 4216.24]  and those who do
[4216.24 --> 4216.62]  the work
[4216.62 --> 4217.38]  is not accurate.
[4218.24 --> 4218.50]  Yes
[4218.50 --> 4219.32]  they are the hands
[4219.32 --> 4220.12]  and feet of Christ
[4220.12 --> 4220.76]  over there
[4220.76 --> 4222.40]  but we are the hands
[4222.40 --> 4223.12]  and feet of Christ
[4223.12 --> 4223.62]  here
[4223.62 --> 4225.66]  and they are
[4225.66 --> 4226.44]  equally called
[4226.44 --> 4227.44]  to pray for us.
[4227.98 --> 4228.52]  Paul would have
[4228.52 --> 4229.10]  been praying
[4229.10 --> 4229.86]  earnestly
[4229.86 --> 4231.16]  for the Roman church.
[4232.14 --> 4233.14]  We are evidence
[4233.14 --> 4235.36]  we have evidence
[4235.36 --> 4236.32]  of that work
[4236.32 --> 4237.28]  done here.
[4237.72 --> 4238.86]  Our volunteer work
[4238.86 --> 4240.08]  in Night Shift
[4240.08 --> 4240.72]  Ministry
[4240.72 --> 4241.62]  Gateway of Hope
[4241.62 --> 4242.34]  Food Bank
[4242.34 --> 4243.68]  the way our deacons
[4243.68 --> 4244.22]  and elders
[4244.22 --> 4245.46]  serve this community
[4245.46 --> 4247.22]  the youth ministry
[4247.22 --> 4248.50]  does volunteer work
[4248.50 --> 4249.30]  as events
[4249.30 --> 4250.18]  we support
[4250.18 --> 4251.18]  our local community
[4251.18 --> 4252.02]  the cadets
[4252.02 --> 4252.64]  and the gems
[4252.64 --> 4253.60]  do missions works
[4253.60 --> 4254.16]  sometimes
[4254.16 --> 4255.12]  as events.
[4255.90 --> 4256.52]  Never mind
[4256.52 --> 4257.76]  all of the unspoken
[4257.76 --> 4258.70]  personal ways
[4258.70 --> 4259.10]  the members
[4259.10 --> 4260.08]  of this congregation
[4260.08 --> 4261.26]  are affecting
[4261.26 --> 4262.40]  Langley and Surrey
[4262.40 --> 4263.18]  and Abbotsford.
[4263.80 --> 4264.90]  All this work
[4264.90 --> 4265.86]  requires us
[4265.86 --> 4267.10]  to sacrifice
[4267.10 --> 4268.38]  to sacrifice
[4268.38 --> 4269.20]  everything.
[4270.24 --> 4271.38]  We need
[4271.38 --> 4272.00]  to be praying
[4272.00 --> 4272.64]  for each other
[4272.64 --> 4273.88]  here the same way
[4273.88 --> 4275.40]  this church prays
[4275.40 --> 4276.14]  for the Christians
[4276.14 --> 4276.78]  out there.
[4279.02 --> 4280.12]  The life
[4280.12 --> 4281.16]  of a Christian
[4281.16 --> 4282.70]  means two things.
[4283.60 --> 4285.36]  The life
[4285.36 --> 4285.84]  of a Christian
[4285.84 --> 4286.70]  requires sacrifice
[4286.70 --> 4287.80]  means two things.
[4289.12 --> 4289.60]  First
[4289.60 --> 4290.28]  the life
[4290.28 --> 4290.70]  of a Christian
[4290.70 --> 4291.92]  requires the sacrifice
[4291.92 --> 4292.90]  we do
[4292.90 --> 4293.92]  and
[4293.92 --> 4294.66]  the life
[4294.66 --> 4295.14]  of a Christian
[4295.14 --> 4296.30]  requires sacrifice.
[4297.38 --> 4298.72]  We sacrifice
[4298.72 --> 4299.48]  everything
[4299.48 --> 4300.64]  because he
[4300.64 --> 4301.24]  sacrificed
[4301.24 --> 4301.90]  everything.
[4302.90 --> 4303.60]  Jesus Christ
[4303.60 --> 4304.44]  the son of God
[4304.44 --> 4305.72]  sacrificed glory
[4305.72 --> 4306.84]  and power
[4306.84 --> 4308.26]  and his very life
[4308.26 --> 4309.50]  so that you
[4309.50 --> 4310.24]  and I
[4310.24 --> 4311.50]  his enemies
[4311.50 --> 4312.76]  the ones
[4312.76 --> 4313.78]  who betrayed him
[4313.78 --> 4314.84]  could have
[4314.84 --> 4315.68]  everything
[4315.68 --> 4317.06]  could have him.
[4318.18 --> 4319.36]  We don't
[4319.36 --> 4320.20]  deserve this.
[4320.68 --> 4321.14]  We deserve
[4321.14 --> 4322.02]  nothing but
[4322.02 --> 4322.80]  dust.
[4323.50 --> 4324.42]  But no
[4324.42 --> 4326.40]  we get him
[4326.40 --> 4327.52]  and because
[4327.52 --> 4328.30]  we have him
[4328.30 --> 4329.10]  who is more
[4329.10 --> 4329.82]  valuable than
[4329.82 --> 4330.40]  the heavens
[4330.40 --> 4331.56]  and the earth
[4331.56 --> 4332.88]  let us
[4332.88 --> 4334.00]  leave this place
[4334.00 --> 4334.46]  willing
[4334.46 --> 4335.66]  in gratitude
[4335.66 --> 4337.02]  to sacrifice
[4337.02 --> 4338.46]  everything.
[4343.90 --> 4344.78]  Let's pray.
[4348.16 --> 4349.08]  Dear Lord
[4349.08 --> 4350.82]  I pray
[4350.82 --> 4351.38]  that this
[4351.38 --> 4351.88]  truth
[4351.88 --> 4352.64]  that this
[4352.64 --> 4353.72]  this call
[4353.72 --> 4354.90]  to sacrifice
[4354.90 --> 4355.26]  Lord
[4355.26 --> 4357.06]  as living
[4357.06 --> 4357.80]  sacrifices
[4357.80 --> 4358.30]  I pray
[4358.30 --> 4358.54]  Lord
[4358.54 --> 4358.90]  that we
[4358.90 --> 4359.24]  would
[4359.24 --> 4360.42]  that we
[4360.42 --> 4360.94]  would do it
[4360.94 --> 4361.12]  that we
[4361.12 --> 4361.58]  would answer
[4361.58 --> 4362.16]  your call
[4362.16 --> 4363.46]  the sinners
[4363.46 --> 4363.78]  that we
[4363.78 --> 4364.24]  are Lord
[4364.24 --> 4364.60]  I pray
[4364.60 --> 4364.88]  that with
[4364.88 --> 4366.20]  the Lord
[4366.20 --> 4366.86]  Jesus Christ
[4366.86 --> 4367.36]  and the power
[4367.36 --> 4367.74]  of the Holy
[4367.74 --> 4368.36]  Spirit Lord
[4368.36 --> 4368.66]  that we
[4368.66 --> 4369.36]  would pray
[4369.36 --> 4371.00]  that your
[4371.00 --> 4371.54]  work would be
[4371.54 --> 4371.98]  accomplished
[4371.98 --> 4372.70]  that the
[4372.70 --> 4373.14]  miraculous
[4373.14 --> 4373.62]  would be
[4373.62 --> 4373.94]  done
[4373.94 --> 4375.92]  in Jesus
[4375.92 --> 4376.24]  name I
[4376.24 --> 4376.42]  pray
[4376.42 --> 4376.58]  Amen
[4376.58 --> 4377.30]  Amen
[4377.30 --> 4378.22]  Amen
[4378.22 --> 4388.70]  A
[4388.70 --> 4389.96]  key
[4389.96 --> 4392.62]  in
[4392.62 --> 4393.60]  amen
[4393.60 --> 4397.40]  time
[4397.40 --> 4398.24]  to
[4398.24 --> 4398.78]  Paul
[4398.78 --> 4401.94]  haha
[4401.94 --> 4403.74]  Anne
[4403.74 --> 4404.14]  to
[4404.14 --> 4429.92]  Hear my prayer, O Lord
[4429.92 --> 4436.28]  From the ends of the earth I cry
[4436.28 --> 4442.20]  Your peace will lead me to
[4442.20 --> 4447.78]  The rock that is higher than I
[4447.78 --> 4458.32]  Hear my prayer, O Lord
[4458.32 --> 4464.32]  From the ends of the earth I cry
[4464.92 --> 4470.72]  Your peace will lead me to
[4470.72 --> 4476.32]  The rock that is higher than I
[4476.32 --> 4484.72]  For you have been my strength in times of trouble
[4484.72 --> 4490.32]  A tower above all my enemies
[4490.32 --> 4496.32]  And Lord, I will abide with you forever
[4496.32 --> 4502.32]  In the shelter of your wings
[4503.28 --> 4509.32]  For you have been my strength in times of trouble
[4509.32 --> 4515.32]  A tower above all my enemies
[4515.32 --> 4521.32]  And Lord, I will abide with you forever
[4521.32 --> 4527.32]  In the shelter of your wings
[4527.32 --> 4539.32]  Hear my prayer, O Lord
[4539.32 --> 4545.32]  From the ends of the earth I cry
[4545.92 --> 4551.32]  Your peace will lead me to
[4551.32 --> 4557.32]  The rock that is higher than I
[4557.32 --> 4564.32]  The rock that is higher than I
[4564.32 --> 4568.08]  And let you be singing
[4568.08 --> 4580.96]  Even as God calls us to great sacrifice
[4580.96 --> 4584.48]  in response to the greatest sacrifice
[4584.48 --> 4586.42]  that he has made in the Lord Jesus
[4586.42 --> 4590.90]  He promises to equip us for our lives of faith
[4590.90 --> 4592.02]  And sacrifice
[4592.02 --> 4594.80]  And part of the way he does that
[4594.80 --> 4597.90]  Is not only through the regular hearing
[4597.90 --> 4599.54]  And proclaiming of his word
[4599.54 --> 4602.22]  But that grace that is offered in the word
[4602.22 --> 4604.30]  Is now offered at the table
[4604.30 --> 4606.28]  So that we might come together
[4606.28 --> 4608.96]  And taste and see that the Lord is good
[4608.96 --> 4611.00]  As we come to the table
[4611.00 --> 4613.46]  We have opportunity to do so
[4613.46 --> 4614.74]  With some liturgy
[4614.74 --> 4616.92]  That you are invited to speak as well
[4616.92 --> 4618.34]  And so you can follow behind
[4618.34 --> 4620.86]  Follow along on the screen behind
[4620.86 --> 4622.00]  And speak those parts
[4622.00 --> 4623.50]  That are indicated for you
[4623.50 --> 4625.50]  Lift up your hearts
[4625.50 --> 4628.08]  We lift the heart to the Lord
[4628.08 --> 4631.62]  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God
[4631.62 --> 4634.64]  It is right for us to give thanks
[4634.64 --> 4636.44]  Let's pray together
[4636.44 --> 4640.22]  Holy God
[4640.22 --> 4643.00]  You raised up Christ
[4643.00 --> 4645.32]  To rule over all creation
[4645.32 --> 4650.56]  Giving him the name that is above every name
[4650.56 --> 4652.82]  That at the name of Jesus
[4652.82 --> 4654.16]  Every knee shall bow
[4654.16 --> 4656.60]  And so we praise you
[4656.60 --> 4659.40]  That lifted in power
[4659.40 --> 4662.36]  He lives and reigns forever
[4662.36 --> 4663.42]  In your glory
[4663.42 --> 4665.70]  And so fulfills his promise
[4665.70 --> 4667.92]  To be with us always
[4667.92 --> 4669.84]  To the end of time
[4669.84 --> 4672.02]  And to the end of the world
[4672.02 --> 4674.54]  In Jesus name we pray
[4674.54 --> 4675.68]  Amen
[4675.68 --> 4679.20]  Now our Lord Jesus
[4679.20 --> 4681.60]  Before he suffered and died
[4681.60 --> 4684.40]  Gave us this memorial of his sacrifice
[4685.08 --> 4686.52]  Until he comes again
[4686.52 --> 4688.48]  And the Lord Jesus
[4688.48 --> 4690.78]  On the night that he was betrayed
[4690.78 --> 4691.72]  Took bread
[4691.72 --> 4694.56]  And when he had given thanks
[4694.56 --> 4695.86]  He broke it and said
[4695.86 --> 4697.84]  This is my body
[4697.84 --> 4698.92]  Which is for you
[4698.92 --> 4702.08]  Do this in remembrance of me
[4702.08 --> 4709.58]  In the same way
[4709.58 --> 4711.12]  After supper
[4711.12 --> 4712.30]  He took the cup
[4712.30 --> 4712.98]  Saying
[4712.98 --> 4715.14]  This cup is the new covenant
[4715.14 --> 4716.36]  In my blood
[4716.36 --> 4718.24]  Do this whenever you drink it
[4718.24 --> 4720.12]  In remembrance of me
[4720.12 --> 4722.74]  For whenever you eat this bread
[4722.74 --> 4724.36]  And drink this cup
[4724.36 --> 4726.18]  You proclaim the Lord's death
[4726.18 --> 4728.30]  Until he comes again
[4728.30 --> 4742.36]  And so we share
[4742.36 --> 4743.74]  In the mystery
[4743.74 --> 4745.84]  Of our faith
[4745.84 --> 4747.70]  Your death
[4747.70 --> 4748.66]  O Christ
[4748.66 --> 4749.56]  We proclaim
[4749.56 --> 4751.32]  Your resurrection
[4751.32 --> 4752.28]  We affirm
[4752.28 --> 4752.94]  With joy
[4752.94 --> 4754.46]  Your coming
[4754.46 --> 4755.28]  We awaited
[4755.28 --> 4755.78]  With hope
[4755.78 --> 4757.86]  Glory be to you
[4757.86 --> 4758.78]  Lord Jesus
[4758.78 --> 4761.28]  Church family
[4761.28 --> 4762.46]  The Lord has
[4762.46 --> 4764.02]  Prepared his table
[4764.02 --> 4765.38]  For all who love him
[4765.38 --> 4767.22]  For all who trust in him
[4767.22 --> 4769.00]  Alone for their salvation
[4769.00 --> 4770.14]  And so
[4770.14 --> 4771.90]  Come to this table
[4771.90 --> 4773.78]  You who have much faith
[4773.78 --> 4775.28]  And you who would like

[4775.90 --> 4778.20]  Come to this table

[4786.06 --> 4786.96]  To follow Jesus
[4786.96 --> 4789.26]  And you who have failed
[4789.26 --> 4791.52]  Come to this table
[4791.52 --> 4793.36]  Because Jesus Christ
[4793.36 --> 4796.42]  Is our resurrected king
[4796.42 --> 4798.30]  And he invites you
[4798.30 --> 4799.46]  To come
[4799.46 --> 4801.92]  Come to this table
[4801.92 --> 4803.18]  If you are here with us

[4805.10 --> 4806.10]  And at home
[4806.10 --> 4807.68]  Come because it is Christ
[4807.68 --> 4808.84]  Who invites us

[4821.60 --> 4823.32]  In a very particular way
