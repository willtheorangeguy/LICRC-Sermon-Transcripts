[0.00 --> 8.42]  I want you as you are, not as you ought to be.
[9.68 --> 13.32]  Won't you lay down your guard and come to me?
[15.22 --> 19.02]  The shame that grips you now is crippling.
[20.94 --> 24.36]  It breaks my heart to see you suffering.
[25.70 --> 27.82]  Cause I am for you.
[27.82 --> 31.82]  I'm not against you.
[33.32 --> 40.72]  If you wanna know how far my love can go, just how deep, just how wide.
[41.04 --> 47.82]  If you wanna see how much you mean to me, look at my hands, look at my side.
[48.60 --> 53.64]  If you could count the times I'd say you are forgiven.
[53.64 --> 57.10]  It's more than the drops in the ocean.
[57.82 --> 68.78]  Don't think you need to settle for a substitute.
[70.34 --> 74.26]  When I'm the only love that changes you.
[74.26 --> 76.26]  And I am for you.
[76.26 --> 80.26]  I'm not against you.
[80.26 --> 82.26]  I'm not against you.
[82.26 --> 84.26]  I am for you.
[84.26 --> 87.22]  I'm not against you.
[87.22 --> 91.22]  If you wanna know how far my love can go, just how deep, just how wide.
[91.22 --> 105.18]  If you wanna see how much you mean to me, look at my hands, look at my side.
[105.18 --> 110.22]  If you could count the times I'd say you are forgiven.
[110.22 --> 112.22]  It's more than the drops in the ocean.
[112.22 --> 114.34]  It's more than the drops in the ocean.
[119.24 --> 121.18]  Drops in the ocean.
[121.18 --> 125.66]  Open your heart, it's time that we start again
[125.66 --> 133.26]  Open your heart, it's time that we start again
[133.26 --> 139.20]  If you wanna know how far my love can go
[139.20 --> 142.46]  Just how deep, just how wide
[142.46 --> 146.68]  If you wanna see how much you mean to me
[146.68 --> 149.98]  Look at my hands, look at my soul
[149.98 --> 155.66]  If you can count the times, the day you are forgiven
[155.66 --> 159.16]  It's more than the drops in the ocean
[159.16 --> 166.56]  The drops in the ocean
[166.56 --> 175.26]  Oh, I'm fighting for you
[175.26 --> 179.26]  I'm not against you
[179.26 --> 182.94]  I am for you
[182.94 --> 187.00]  I'm not against you
[187.00 --> 209.18]  You're not the only one who feels like this
[209.18 --> 212.86]  Feeling like you lose more than you win
[212.86 --> 216.54]  Like life is just an endless hill you climb
[216.54 --> 222.22]  You try and try, but never arrive
[222.22 --> 224.28]  I'm telling you something
[224.28 --> 227.96]  This racing, this racing, this running
[227.96 --> 229.96]  Oh, you're working way too hard
[229.96 --> 231.96]  You're working way too hard
[231.96 --> 237.64]  I'm not against you, I'm not against you
[237.64 --> 241.32]  So go ahead and live like you're in the ocean
[241.32 --> 243.32]  So go ahead and live like you're loved
[243.32 --> 245.32]  Live like you're loved
[245.32 --> 247.00]  Live like you're loved
[247.00 --> 249.00]  Live like you're loved
[249.00 --> 252.68]  Live like you're loved
[252.68 --> 256.36]  Live like you're loved
[256.36 --> 258.36]  Live like you're loved
[258.36 --> 265.36]  Live like you're loved.
[265.36 --> 269.36]  Live like you're loved.
[269.36 --> 273.36]  And live like you know you're valuable.
[273.36 --> 277.36]  Like you know the one that holds your soul.
[277.36 --> 281.36]  Cause mercy has called you by your name.
[281.36 --> 285.36]  Don't be afraid to live in that grace.
[285.36 --> 288.36]  Oh, I'm telling you something.
[288.36 --> 290.36]  This God we believe in.
[290.36 --> 293.36]  Yeah, he changed everything.
[293.36 --> 296.36]  No more guilt, no more shame.
[296.36 --> 298.36]  He took all that away.
[298.36 --> 301.36]  Gave us a reason to sing.
[301.36 --> 305.36]  So go ahead and live like you're loved.
[305.36 --> 309.36]  It's okay to act like you've been set free.
[309.36 --> 313.36]  His love has made you more than enough.
[313.36 --> 317.36]  So go ahead and be who we made you to be.
[317.36 --> 321.36]  And live like you're loved.
[321.36 --> 325.36]  Live like you're loved.
[325.36 --> 329.36]  Live like you're loved.
[329.36 --> 333.36]  Live like you're loved.
[333.36 --> 335.36]  Live like you're loved.
[335.36 --> 337.36]  Walk like you're free.
[337.36 --> 341.36]  Sail like you know who we made you to be.
[341.36 --> 343.36]  Live like you're loved.
[343.36 --> 344.36]  Live like you're loved.
[344.36 --> 345.36]  Live like you're loved.
[345.36 --> 348.36]  Live like you're loved.
[348.36 --> 349.36]  His love is all that you'll ever need.
[349.36 --> 352.36]  So go ahead and live like you're loved.
[352.36 --> 356.36]  His love has made you more than enough.
[356.36 --> 360.70]  His love has made you more than enough
[360.70 --> 368.68]  So go ahead and live like your love
[368.68 --> 373.32]  It's okay to act like you've been set free
[373.32 --> 377.00]  His love has made you more than enough
[377.00 --> 381.54]  So go ahead and be who he made you to be
[381.54 --> 384.32]  And live like your love
[384.32 --> 387.42]  Live like your love
[387.42 --> 391.40]  Live like your love
[391.40 --> 393.46]  Live like your love
[393.46 --> 395.48]  Live like your love
[395.48 --> 399.50]  Live like your love
[399.50 --> 401.48]  Walk like you're free
[401.48 --> 405.48]  Steal like you know who he made you to be
[405.48 --> 407.58]  Live like your love
[407.58 --> 409.54]  Like you believe
[409.54 --> 413.54]  His love is all that you'll ever need
[413.54 --> 416.64]  Live like your love
[416.64 --> 418.64]  Live like your love
[418.64 --> 421.74]  Live like your love
[421.74 --> 423.74]  Live like your love
[423.74 --> 427.78]  And you're not the one that you would have chosen
[427.78 --> 438.40]  When you're at the end of the road
[438.40 --> 442.88]  And it's not the one that you would have chosen
[442.88 --> 446.38]  When you're at the end of your road
[446.38 --> 447.94]  And you're holding on
[447.94 --> 450.70]  But feel like you're falling
[450.70 --> 452.80]  With every option
[452.80 --> 453.80]  With every option exhausted
[453.80 --> 455.80]  With every option exhausted
[455.80 --> 457.80]  You tried everything you know
[457.80 --> 462.84]  You saw light then you lost it
[462.84 --> 465.80]  But there is still hope
[465.80 --> 468.90]  Like the fire in the night
[468.90 --> 472.90]  Like the ocean parted wide
[472.90 --> 476.94]  Like the grave empty inside
[476.94 --> 478.90]  You will see
[478.90 --> 480.90]  He still does
[480.90 --> 483.00]  Miracles
[483.00 --> 484.00]  Miracles
[484.00 --> 485.00]  Miracles
[485.00 --> 486.00]  Miracles
[486.00 --> 487.00]  Miracles
[487.00 --> 489.00]  Miracles
[489.00 --> 493.12]  Even if you don't see it now
[493.12 --> 494.82]  Without a doubt
[494.82 --> 497.00]  He's already moving
[497.00 --> 501.04]  There is not a pain that you hold
[501.04 --> 502.64]  He doesn't know
[502.64 --> 505.48]  And he isn't using
[505.48 --> 508.78]  With every option exhausted
[508.78 --> 513.02]  You tried everything you know
[513.02 --> 517.62]  So reach for something beyond it
[517.62 --> 520.54]  Cause he is our hope
[520.54 --> 524.46]  Like the fire in the night
[524.46 --> 528.42]  Like the ocean parted wide
[528.42 --> 532.28]  Like the grave empty inside
[532.28 --> 534.14]  You will see
[534.14 --> 536.28]  He still does
[536.28 --> 537.68]  Miracles
[537.68 --> 539.48]  Miracles
[539.48 --> 541.48]  Miracles
[541.48 --> 543.38]  Miracles
[543.38 --> 545.38]  Miracles
[545.38 --> 547.38]  Miracles
[547.38 --> 549.38]  Miracles
[549.38 --> 551.38]  Miracles
[551.38 --> 556.02]  A broken heart can be restored
[556.02 --> 559.98]  A broken soul can be reborn
[559.98 --> 563.88]  And greater things are still in store
[563.88 --> 566.04]  For us
[566.04 --> 568.10]  For us
[568.10 --> 573.24]  Like the fire in the night
[573.24 --> 577.18]  Like the ocean parted wide
[577.18 --> 581.02]  Like the grave empty inside
[581.02 --> 582.96]  You will see
[582.96 --> 585.08]  He still does
[585.08 --> 586.48]  Miracles
[586.48 --> 588.48]  Miracles
[588.48 --> 590.48]  Miracles
[590.48 --> 592.48]  Miracles
[592.48 --> 594.48]  Miracles
[594.48 --> 595.48]  Miracles
[595.48 --> 596.48]  Miracles
[596.48 --> 597.48]  He's still there
[597.48 --> 599.48]  He's still there
[599.48 --> 601.48]  Miracles
[601.48 --> 603.48]  You're the new kid
[603.48 --> 604.48]  I'm dreaming
[604.48 --> 606.48]  More than you
[606.48 --> 607.48]  I'm not
[607.48 --> 609.48]  Miracles
[609.48 --> 611.48]  This is my
[611.48 --> 613.48]  This is my
[613.48 --> 614.48]  Miracles
[614.48 --> 615.48]  Miracles
[615.48 --> 628.48]  Miracles
[628.48 --> 658.46]  I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I'm not enough.
[658.48 --> 688.46]  I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I'm not enough.
[688.50 --> 690.46]  And that we get to worship together.
[690.66 --> 691.66]  My name is Chris.
[692.12 --> 695.04]  I'm one of the pastors here at Langley Emanuel.
[695.30 --> 700.00]  And it's my privilege this morning, along with these others, to lead in our shared worship together.
[700.62 --> 702.60]  As I mentioned, we have a couple announcements.
[702.60 --> 714.92]  First, immediately following worship today, well, I shouldn't say immediately, after our fellowship time and the like, youth coffee is going to happen.
[715.06 --> 716.96]  And that's at the Verhoof home.
[716.96 --> 722.76]  And so if you would need to know where that is, youth or parents of youth, you can talk to Pastor Kevin here.
[723.18 --> 725.08]  Or Warren and Mel, who are over there.
[725.30 --> 727.72]  They will let you know how to get to their house.
[727.72 --> 737.44]  Additionally, Pastor Kevin asked me to remind all of you youth that registration for youth camp is open and active.
[738.22 --> 744.64]  And so please do that quickly and get that done so that they can plan that weekend for you.
[744.64 --> 757.24]  As well, today, this afternoon, at 2 p.m., a bunch of the women from our church are going to gather together for a baby blessing.
[757.24 --> 760.62]  Is it the babies who are being blessed?
[760.70 --> 762.56]  Are the parents of the babies who are being blessed?
[762.90 --> 768.22]  Either way, there's a bit of a gathering, a party that's happening at 2 p.m.
[768.22 --> 769.20]  That will be here.
[769.70 --> 775.48]  And that's for five different baby girls that have born in our community in the last number of months.
[775.68 --> 781.14]  And so please, if you have any questions about that, Wendy has answers.
[781.26 --> 782.02]  Wendy, where are you?
[782.52 --> 783.42]  Wendy is back there.
[783.54 --> 784.32]  She has answers.
[784.32 --> 790.38]  You can get her or grab me at the Connect booth, and I will connect you to Wendy or someone else with that.
[791.62 --> 793.28]  Lastly, final announcement.
[793.66 --> 797.26]  This coming Thursday is Ascension Day.
[798.10 --> 806.20]  Ascension Day is the day that we remember Jesus ascending back to heaven after his resurrection.
[806.40 --> 812.06]  So 40 days after the resurrection, Jesus ascended to the right hand of the Father.
[812.06 --> 816.62]  And from there, he will come to judge the living and the dead, says the Apostles' Creed.
[817.44 --> 822.20]  We're going to have a worship service to commemorate and celebrate that together.
[822.78 --> 824.78]  And we're going to do that service a little bit differently.
[825.56 --> 827.02]  And so we encourage you to come.
[827.44 --> 836.56]  We're going to set up in this space here and kind of do it in the round in our worship together with a bit of an acoustic worship set.
[836.56 --> 838.54]  And it's going to look a little different.
[838.64 --> 845.56]  And so we encourage you to come, and we'd love to have you participate at 7 p.m. on Thursday together.
[846.34 --> 851.14]  If you have any questions about that, you can also get me at the Connect booth following our worship.
[851.66 --> 853.34]  I think that's it for announcements.
[854.20 --> 857.14]  And so I'm going to invite you, as you're able, to stand.
[857.14 --> 865.16]  And we can be ushered into the presence of our good God in worship by receiving his greeting.
[865.86 --> 872.46]  After the greeting of God, I invite you to turn to those around you and welcome them into worship in whatever way you are comfortable.
[872.70 --> 881.10]  With a fist bump or a head nod or a hug or a holy kiss, which is biblical, but also mind people's boundaries.
[881.10 --> 886.48]  In our worship together, receive the greeting of God.
[887.76 --> 895.58]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, Son, and our Savior,
[896.18 --> 898.64]  through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[899.54 --> 899.88]  Amen.
[911.10 --> 912.10]  Amen.
[913.86 --> 915.72]  Amen.
[915.72 --> 920.26]  Amen.
[920.26 --> 943.72]  Good morning.
[943.72 --> 943.76]  Good morning.
[943.76 --> 973.74]  Good morning.
[974.20 --> 978.44]  Lord, we are grateful to be gathered together today to worship your holy name.
[979.06 --> 984.76]  We offer our worship and our adoration to you, for only you are worthy to be praised.
[985.48 --> 991.26]  We lift up our voices together, united as one community, to offer you all that you are due.
[992.10 --> 995.34]  Thank you for bringing us together today to worship in this place.
[996.24 --> 996.52]  Amen.
[997.18 --> 998.44]  Please join us in worship.
[998.44 --> 998.56]  Amen.
[1003.76 --> 1004.76]  Amen.
[1004.76 --> 1005.76]  Amen.
[1005.76 --> 1006.76]  Amen.

[1008.76 --> 1009.76]  Amen.
[1009.76 --> 1010.76]  Amen.
[1010.76 --> 1011.76]  Amen.
[1011.76 --> 1027.90]  He has held the oceans in His hands,
[1027.90 --> 1033.20]  He has no burdening grain of sand.
[1033.72 --> 1038.72]  Kings and nations tremble at His voice,
[1038.72 --> 1045.16]  All creation has to rejoice.
[1045.16 --> 1052.36]  Behold our God, sing it on His song,
[1052.36 --> 1056.28]  Come let us adore Him.
[1056.28 --> 1063.08]  Behold our King, nothing can compare,
[1063.08 --> 1069.52]  Come let us adore Him.
[1069.52 --> 1077.96]  Who has given counsel to the Lord?
[1077.96 --> 1082.96]  Who can question any of His words?
[1082.96 --> 1087.96]  Who can teach the one who knows all things?
[1087.96 --> 1094.40]  Who can follow all His wondrous deeds?
[1094.40 --> 1102.40]  Behold our God, sing it on His throne,
[1102.40 --> 1106.40]  Come let us adore Him.
[1106.40 --> 1112.84]  Behold our King, nothing can compare,
[1112.84 --> 1119.28]  Come let us adore Him.
[1119.28 --> 1133.72]  Who has felt the nails upon His hands,
[1133.72 --> 1138.72]  Bearing all the guilt of sinful men,
[1138.72 --> 1145.16]  God eternal, helpful to the grave,
[1145.16 --> 1151.16]  Jesus, Savior, risen now to reign.
[1151.16 --> 1157.60]  Behold our King, nothing can compare,
[1157.60 --> 1161.60]  Come let us adore Him.
[1161.60 --> 1167.60]  Behold our King, nothing can compare,
[1167.60 --> 1173.60]  Come let us adore Him.
[1173.60 --> 1186.04]  Come let us adore Him.
[1186.04 --> 1190.04]  Behold our King, nothing can compare,
[1190.04 --> 1193.04]  Come let us adore Him.
[1193.04 --> 1196.04]  Come let us adore Him.
[1196.04 --> 1200.04]  Come let us adore Him.
[1200.04 --> 1224.10]  Behold our King, nothing can compare,
[1224.10 --> 1236.24]  Oh, darling, nothing can compare, come let us adore Him.
[1254.10 --> 1256.10]  Amen.
[1284.10 --> 1296.28]  Oh, God, my Father, there is no shadow of turning with me.
[1296.28 --> 1304.28]  Thou changest not, but no passions may fail now.
[1304.80 --> 1311.36]  The sound has been, but forever will be.
[1311.36 --> 1319.36]  Great is Thy faithfulness, great is Thy faithfulness.
[1320.70 --> 1327.36]  Morning by morning new mercies I see.
[1328.76 --> 1335.36]  All I have needed, Thy hand hath provided.
[1335.36 --> 1344.36]  Praise the faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
[1344.36 --> 1353.36]  Summer and winter and springtime and harvest.
[1353.36 --> 1362.26]  Sun, moon, and stars again, for saints of love.
[1362.36 --> 1369.36]  Joyed with all nature and beautiful witness.
[1369.36 --> 1377.36]  To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.
[1377.36 --> 1386.50]  Great is Thy faithfulness, great is Thy faithfulness.
[1386.70 --> 1393.36]  Morning by morning new mercies I see.
[1393.36 --> 1402.36]  All I have needed, Thy hand hath provided.
[1402.36 --> 1410.36]  Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
[1410.36 --> 1427.36]  God, O dear, praise us each year and tonight.
[1427.36 --> 1436.36]  Straight or today and bright hope for tomorrow.

[2065.32 --> 2068.32]  Good morning, my name is Mike, and I'm a deacon here at the church.
[2068.32 --> 2071.32]  And we have an opportunity now to give of our financial gifts.
[2071.32 --> 2074.32]  So today we're giving to New Ground Ministries.
[2074.32 --> 2080.32]  It's actually a ministry of the CRC church, and it's tied to the Diaconal Ministries of Canada.
[2080.32 --> 2089.32]  But what makes them especially special is their model is they help fund new ministries
[2089.32 --> 2093.32]  and help come alongside like grassroots ministries that are kind of community focused.
[2093.32 --> 2100.32]  So it's a national sort of little sub-organization that really helps get good new ministries off the ground.
[2100.32 --> 2107.32]  But the piece that's really cool about them, I was involved with them for a couple of years, is they also offer coaching.
[2107.32 --> 2114.32]  So they'll coach a new ministry or a new organization for about three years as they also provide funds to help them get started.
[2114.32 --> 2121.32]  So look them up. You can look at the list of organizations they have helped get off the ground and are healthy today.
[2121.32 --> 2127.32]  And we also actually have two members of our congregation that are committee members for the National Committee,
[2127.32 --> 2129.32]  and that's Kim Prins and Ali Stam.
[2129.32 --> 2133.32]  So if you have other questions about New Ground, I'm sure they'd love to fill you in.
[2133.32 --> 2135.32]  Thank you for giving this morning.

[2456.06 --> 2457.96]  but yesterday
[2457.96 --> 2458.56]  when we were
[2458.56 --> 2459.60]  at this musical

[2482.00 --> 2482.80]  when he was saying
[2482.80 --> 2483.78]  that he didn't
[2483.78 --> 2484.86]  actually love Anna
[2484.86 --> 2485.24]  do you know
[2485.24 --> 2485.78]  what they did?

[2493.38 --> 2494.20]  why they booed him?
[2495.00 --> 2495.80]  well because he's
[2495.80 --> 2497.02]  kind of hard to like
[2497.02 --> 2497.60]  right?
[2497.72 --> 2498.74]  he's not very nice
[2498.74 --> 2500.78]  he doesn't do
[2500.78 --> 2501.50]  kind things
[2501.50 --> 2502.12]  to other people
[2502.12 --> 2503.04]  and he tricks Anna
[2503.04 --> 2503.30]  right?
[2503.36 --> 2504.32]  and it's hard to like him
[2504.32 --> 2505.66]  so today
[2505.66 --> 2506.54]  in children's worship
[2506.54 --> 2507.26]  what we're going to
[2507.26 --> 2507.78]  talk about
[2507.78 --> 2508.74]  is that God
[2508.74 --> 2509.62]  wants us to love
[2509.62 --> 2510.66]  people who are
[2510.66 --> 2511.68]  hard to love
[2511.68 --> 2513.52]  people like Hans
[2513.52 --> 2514.70]  who might be hard to love
[2514.70 --> 2515.56]  so we're going to
[2515.56 --> 2515.92]  think about
[2515.92 --> 2516.54]  what that means
[2516.54 --> 2517.20]  for us
[2517.20 --> 2518.00]  and our life
[2518.00 --> 2518.76]  and how we love
[2518.76 --> 2519.70]  those around us
[2519.70 --> 2520.98]  so I'd like to
[2520.98 --> 2522.20]  invite you to stand up
[2522.20 --> 2522.82]  and we're going to
[2522.82 --> 2523.66]  do the children's
[2523.66 --> 2524.00]  blessing
[2524.00 --> 2525.42]  and then head off
[2547.20 --> 2563.40]  good morning
[2563.40 --> 2564.64]  I'm Steve
[2564.64 --> 2565.22]  an elder here
[2565.22 --> 2566.36]  and I have the pleasure
[2566.36 --> 2567.48]  of leading
[2567.48 --> 2569.02]  prayer this morning
[2569.02 --> 2570.56]  let's pray
[2570.56 --> 2573.54]  ever faithful
[2573.54 --> 2575.20]  resurrecting God
[2575.20 --> 2575.64]  and Father
[2575.64 --> 2577.12]  we thank you
[2577.12 --> 2578.32]  for being our God
[2578.32 --> 2579.30]  and calling us
[2579.30 --> 2579.88]  into communion
[2579.88 --> 2580.38]  with you
[2580.38 --> 2582.32]  thank you for giving us
[2582.32 --> 2583.04]  prayer
[2583.04 --> 2584.18]  as a way to communicate
[2584.18 --> 2585.38]  a way to praise
[2585.38 --> 2586.26]  praise you
[2586.26 --> 2588.06]  to confess our shortcomings
[2588.06 --> 2589.72]  to give you thanks
[2589.72 --> 2591.00]  a way to petition
[2591.00 --> 2591.66]  and claim
[2591.66 --> 2592.48]  your promises
[2592.48 --> 2594.40]  and a way to ask you
[2594.40 --> 2595.00]  to intercede
[2595.00 --> 2595.60]  in our lives
[2595.60 --> 2596.50]  in the lives
[2596.50 --> 2596.98]  of others
[2596.98 --> 2598.40]  you are the one
[2598.40 --> 2599.36]  constant in life
[2599.36 --> 2601.82]  Lord you are the creator
[2601.82 --> 2602.94]  the one who shapes
[2602.94 --> 2604.14]  and molds all things
[2604.14 --> 2605.56]  and the one who gives us
[2605.56 --> 2606.56]  purpose and meaning
[2606.56 --> 2608.26]  help us to recognize
[2608.26 --> 2609.80]  that we need to be
[2609.80 --> 2610.82]  reconciled with you
[2610.82 --> 2611.54]  before we are
[2611.54 --> 2613.28]  able to fully reconcile
[2613.28 --> 2614.14]  with one another
[2614.14 --> 2616.40]  work in our hearts
[2616.40 --> 2617.18]  and shape us
[2617.18 --> 2618.02]  through the work
[2618.02 --> 2618.94]  of the Holy Spirit
[2618.94 --> 2620.02]  a shaping
[2620.02 --> 2620.86]  that never seems
[2620.86 --> 2621.92]  to be easy
[2621.92 --> 2622.46]  to endure
[2622.46 --> 2623.64]  or understand
[2623.64 --> 2625.46]  Lord we confess
[2625.46 --> 2626.38]  that we resist
[2626.38 --> 2627.10]  being shaped
[2627.10 --> 2628.32]  through life's
[2628.32 --> 2628.96]  circumstances
[2628.96 --> 2629.74]  and the works
[2629.74 --> 2630.14]  and gifts
[2630.14 --> 2631.00]  of the Holy Spirit
[2631.00 --> 2632.72]  instead we allow
[2632.72 --> 2633.56]  our egos to get
[2633.56 --> 2633.96]  in the way
[2633.96 --> 2635.08]  and allow ourselves
[2635.08 --> 2635.68]  to be shaped
[2635.68 --> 2637.14]  by the many external
[2637.14 --> 2638.14]  influences of the world
[2638.14 --> 2638.76]  around us
[2638.76 --> 2640.28]  we confess
[2640.28 --> 2641.38]  that rather being shaped
[2641.38 --> 2642.12]  by your teachings
[2642.12 --> 2642.88]  and instructions
[2642.88 --> 2644.22]  and by the gifts
[2644.22 --> 2644.78]  and talents
[2644.78 --> 2645.84]  that you give each of us
[2645.84 --> 2647.14]  we look to the world
[2647.14 --> 2647.68]  around us
[2647.68 --> 2648.46]  for affirmation
[2648.46 --> 2648.88]  and meaning
[2648.88 --> 2650.72]  we often aimlessly
[2650.72 --> 2652.28]  follow each new trend
[2652.28 --> 2653.50]  we confess
[2653.50 --> 2654.32]  that we would rather
[2654.32 --> 2655.64]  walk the smooth path
[2655.64 --> 2656.40]  than to endure
[2656.40 --> 2657.66]  struggles and temptations
[2657.66 --> 2658.96]  we confess
[2658.96 --> 2660.18]  that we easily
[2660.18 --> 2660.74]  complain
[2660.74 --> 2661.60]  when faced
[2661.60 --> 2662.22]  with difficulties
[2662.22 --> 2663.32]  rather than
[2663.32 --> 2664.20]  follow the example
[2664.20 --> 2665.10]  set by your son
[2665.10 --> 2666.36]  we confess
[2666.36 --> 2667.20]  that we often
[2667.20 --> 2667.74]  lose sight
[2667.74 --> 2668.32]  of what is really
[2668.32 --> 2668.78]  important
[2668.78 --> 2669.90]  forgive us father
[2669.90 --> 2671.52]  open our eyes
[2671.52 --> 2672.06]  and our hearts
[2672.06 --> 2672.76]  to your plan

[2679.26 --> 2679.92]  the outpouring
[2679.92 --> 2680.56]  of your love
[2680.56 --> 2681.42]  but also the love
[2681.42 --> 2682.40]  of family and friends
[2682.40 --> 2683.10]  and the acts
[2683.10 --> 2683.50]  of love
[2683.50 --> 2684.54]  and kindness
[2684.54 --> 2685.20]  shown to

[2686.80 --> 2687.80]  thank you
[2687.80 --> 2688.86]  for your all sufficient

[2701.20 --> 2702.00]  in all we do
[2702.00 --> 2704.04]  we do not fully
[2704.04 --> 2705.48]  know or understand
[2705.48 --> 2706.02]  your will
[2706.02 --> 2706.62]  and our plan
[2706.62 --> 2707.46]  for our lives
[2707.46 --> 2708.46]  but teach us
[2708.46 --> 2708.92]  to trust

[2842.46 --> 2844.08]  your son

[2845.18 --> 2846.24]  Amen
[2846.24 --> 2865.98]  to pick up
[2865.98 --> 2867.84]  in essence
[2867.84 --> 2868.36]  from where
[2868.36 --> 2869.62]  Nikki brought us
[2869.62 --> 2870.86]  I'll do my best
[2870.86 --> 2871.62]  this morning
[2871.62 --> 2873.44]  to leave
[2873.44 --> 2874.48]  where you're
[2874.48 --> 2875.16]  you're not
[2875.16 --> 2875.78]  booing me
[2875.78 --> 2876.38]  off stage
[2876.38 --> 2880.54]  as we dig
[2880.54 --> 2881.22]  into our text
[2881.22 --> 2881.68]  this morning
[2881.68 --> 2882.78]  we're going to read
[2882.78 --> 2884.34]  from Romans 15
[2884.34 --> 2885.84]  1 through 13
[2885.84 --> 2888.08]  and let me just
[2888.08 --> 2888.68]  sort of set
[2888.68 --> 2889.74]  the stage
[2889.74 --> 2890.16]  because
[2890.16 --> 2892.16]  we come into
[2892.16 --> 2892.70]  this
[2892.70 --> 2893.60]  recognizing
[2893.60 --> 2895.84]  that we all
[2895.84 --> 2896.80]  know people
[2896.80 --> 2897.92]  but none of us
[2897.92 --> 2898.88]  are those people
[2898.88 --> 2900.72]  who are
[2900.72 --> 2902.04]  disagreeable
[2902.04 --> 2904.94]  someone got it
[2904.94 --> 2905.46]  over there
[2905.46 --> 2907.04]  right
[2907.04 --> 2907.52]  we all know
[2907.52 --> 2908.36]  people who
[2908.36 --> 2909.44]  seems like
[2909.44 --> 2910.32]  they want to
[2910.32 --> 2911.62]  argue everything
[2911.62 --> 2912.04]  you say
[2912.04 --> 2912.94]  just for the sake
[2912.94 --> 2913.42]  of arguing
[2913.42 --> 2914.34]  everything you say
[2914.34 --> 2916.60]  and I'll be honest
[2916.60 --> 2919.06]  it's kind of fun
[2919.06 --> 2920.96]  I'm kind of that
[2920.96 --> 2921.72]  guy sometimes
[2921.72 --> 2922.60]  I enjoy
[2922.60 --> 2923.74]  a good argument
[2923.74 --> 2925.46]  I enjoy
[2925.46 --> 2926.54]  a hard
[2926.54 --> 2927.44]  discussion
[2927.44 --> 2931.00]  but what
[2931.00 --> 2931.98]  happens
[2931.98 --> 2933.26]  and again
[2933.26 --> 2933.84]  this doesn't
[2933.84 --> 2934.38]  happen here
[2934.38 --> 2936.10]  when there are
[2936.10 --> 2936.58]  people
[2936.58 --> 2938.06]  who
[2938.06 --> 2939.62]  seem to
[2939.62 --> 2940.28]  thrive
[2940.28 --> 2941.92]  in fostering
[2941.92 --> 2942.70]  disunity
[2942.70 --> 2946.12]  what happens
[2946.12 --> 2947.18]  when there's
[2947.18 --> 2947.92]  a group
[2947.92 --> 2948.78]  that is
[2948.78 --> 2949.26]  being
[2949.26 --> 2950.18]  torn apart
[2950.18 --> 2952.12]  by
[2952.12 --> 2952.74]  people
[2952.74 --> 2953.38]  who
[2953.38 --> 2954.86]  for one
[2954.86 --> 2955.28]  reason
[2955.28 --> 2955.98]  or another
[2955.98 --> 2956.72]  sometimes
[2956.72 --> 2958.08]  more legitimate
[2958.08 --> 2958.70]  than other
[2958.70 --> 2959.28]  times
[2959.28 --> 2960.80]  want to
[2960.80 --> 2961.22]  tear that
[2961.22 --> 2961.60]  community
[2961.60 --> 2962.00]  apart
[2962.00 --> 2964.60]  this text
[2964.60 --> 2964.98]  is the
[2964.98 --> 2965.40]  answer
[2965.40 --> 2966.56]  I believe
[2966.56 --> 2967.46]  to that
[2967.46 --> 2969.02]  so I'm
[2969.02 --> 2969.48]  going to read
[2969.48 --> 2971.24]  Romans 15
[2971.24 --> 2972.38]  verses 1
[2972.38 --> 2973.24]  through 13
[2973.24 --> 2974.32]  together
[2974.32 --> 2975.74]  now in many
[2975.74 --> 2976.04]  ways
[2976.04 --> 2977.02]  if you are
[2977.02 --> 2977.34]  a guest
[2977.34 --> 2977.78]  with us
[2977.78 --> 2978.42]  this text
[2978.42 --> 2979.12]  picks up
[2979.12 --> 2979.56]  in a
[2979.56 --> 2980.28]  longer
[2980.28 --> 2981.04]  conversation
[2981.04 --> 2981.48]  we've been
[2981.48 --> 2981.96]  having for
[2981.96 --> 2982.32]  the last
[2982.32 --> 2982.94]  few weeks
[2982.94 --> 2983.78]  I'll do
[2983.78 --> 2984.06]  a little
[2984.06 --> 2984.46]  bit to
[2984.46 --> 2984.92]  recap
[2984.92 --> 2986.80]  but
[2986.80 --> 2987.38]  just
[2987.38 --> 2987.82]  recognize
[2987.82 --> 2988.16]  that we're
[2988.16 --> 2988.42]  starting
[2988.42 --> 2991.64]  mid story
[2991.64 --> 2992.16]  or mid
[2992.16 --> 2992.58]  stream
[2992.58 --> 2993.82]  in chapter
[2993.82 --> 2994.30]  15
[2994.30 --> 2994.90]  you might
[2994.90 --> 2995.16]  even be
[2995.16 --> 2995.42]  able to
[2995.42 --> 2995.96]  see that
[2995.96 --> 2996.94]  based on
[2996.94 --> 2997.50]  the translation
[2997.50 --> 2997.98]  you're reading
[2997.98 --> 2998.24]  from
[2998.24 --> 2998.54]  that there's
[2998.54 --> 2998.92]  no new
[2998.92 --> 2999.24]  heading
[2999.24 --> 3000.08]  there
[3000.08 --> 3000.54]  so
[3000.54 --> 3001.04]  here we
[3001.04 --> 3001.28]  go
[3001.28 --> 3003.52]  we who
[3003.52 --> 3004.30]  are strong
[3004.30 --> 3004.96]  ought to
[3004.96 --> 3005.44]  bear with
[3005.44 --> 3006.08]  the failings
[3006.08 --> 3006.40]  of the
[3006.40 --> 3006.78]  weak
[3006.78 --> 3007.66]  and not
[3007.66 --> 3008.28]  please
[3008.28 --> 3008.74]  ourselves
[3008.74 --> 3010.62]  each of
[3010.62 --> 3011.16]  us should
[3011.16 --> 3011.74]  please our
[3011.74 --> 3012.08]  neighbors
[3012.08 --> 3013.04]  for their
[3013.04 --> 3013.54]  good
[3013.54 --> 3014.46]  to build
[3014.46 --> 3014.90]  them
[3014.90 --> 3015.22]  up
[3015.22 --> 3017.12]  for even
[3017.12 --> 3017.66]  Christ
[3017.66 --> 3018.26]  did not
[3018.26 --> 3018.64]  please
[3018.64 --> 3019.18]  himself
[3019.18 --> 3020.06]  but as
[3020.06 --> 3020.42]  it is
[3020.42 --> 3020.66]  written
[3020.66 --> 3021.90]  the insults
[3021.90 --> 3022.44]  of those
[3022.44 --> 3023.14]  who insult
[3023.14 --> 3023.48]  you
[3023.48 --> 3024.20]  have fallen
[3024.20 --> 3024.88]  on me
[3024.88 --> 3026.88]  for everything
[3026.88 --> 3027.40]  that was
[3027.40 --> 3027.88]  written in
[3027.88 --> 3028.40]  the past
[3028.40 --> 3028.88]  was written
[3028.88 --> 3029.46]  to teach
[3029.46 --> 3029.84]  us
[3029.84 --> 3030.60]  so that
[3030.60 --> 3031.24]  through the
[3031.24 --> 3031.82]  endurance
[3031.82 --> 3032.40]  taught in
[3032.40 --> 3032.88]  the scriptures
[3032.88 --> 3033.62]  and the
[3033.62 --> 3034.16]  encouragement
[3034.16 --> 3035.02]  they provide
[3035.02 --> 3035.86]  we might
[3035.86 --> 3036.40]  have
[3036.40 --> 3037.14]  hope
[3037.14 --> 3039.82]  may the
[3039.82 --> 3040.34]  God who
[3040.34 --> 3040.80]  gives
[3040.80 --> 3041.36]  endurance
[3041.36 --> 3041.92]  and
[3041.92 --> 3042.60]  encouragement
[3042.60 --> 3043.58]  give you
[3043.58 --> 3044.20]  the same
[3044.20 --> 3044.72]  attitude
[3044.72 --> 3045.62]  of mind
[3045.62 --> 3046.48]  toward each
[3046.48 --> 3046.82]  other
[3046.82 --> 3047.80]  that Christ
[3047.80 --> 3048.72]  Jesus had
[3048.72 --> 3049.70]  so that
[3049.70 --> 3050.28]  with one
[3050.28 --> 3050.78]  mind
[3050.78 --> 3051.34]  and one
[3051.34 --> 3051.80]  voice
[3051.80 --> 3052.26]  you may
[3052.26 --> 3053.12]  glorify
[3053.12 --> 3053.84]  the God
[3053.84 --> 3054.42]  and Father
[3054.42 --> 3055.08]  of our
[3055.08 --> 3055.46]  Lord
[3055.46 --> 3055.90]  Jesus
[3055.90 --> 3056.48]  Christ
[3056.48 --> 3058.82]  accept
[3058.82 --> 3059.54]  one another
[3059.54 --> 3060.06]  then
[3060.06 --> 3061.04]  just as
[3061.04 --> 3061.40]  Christ
[3061.40 --> 3061.94]  accepted
[3061.94 --> 3062.32]  you
[3062.32 --> 3063.00]  in order
[3063.00 --> 3063.40]  to bring
[3063.40 --> 3063.92]  praise
[3063.92 --> 3064.48]  to God
[3064.48 --> 3065.80]  for I
[3065.80 --> 3066.26]  tell you
[3066.26 --> 3066.82]  that Christ
[3066.82 --> 3067.44]  has become
[3067.44 --> 3067.98]  a servant
[3067.98 --> 3068.70]  of the Jews
[3068.70 --> 3069.32]  on behalf
[3069.32 --> 3069.90]  of God's
[3069.90 --> 3070.18]  truth
[3070.18 --> 3070.84]  so that
[3070.84 --> 3071.42]  the promises
[3071.42 --> 3071.96]  made
[3071.96 --> 3072.34]  to the
[3072.34 --> 3073.10]  patriarchs
[3073.10 --> 3073.84]  might be
[3073.84 --> 3074.40]  confirmed
[3074.40 --> 3075.66]  and moreover
[3075.66 --> 3076.24]  that the
[3076.24 --> 3076.92]  Gentiles
[3076.92 --> 3077.94]  might glorify
[3077.94 --> 3078.42]  God
[3078.42 --> 3078.88]  for his
[3078.88 --> 3079.26]  mercy
[3079.26 --> 3080.54]  as it
[3080.54 --> 3080.90]  is written
[3080.90 --> 3081.92]  therefore
[3081.92 --> 3082.50]  I will
[3082.50 --> 3083.26]  praise you
[3083.26 --> 3083.72]  among
[3083.72 --> 3084.52]  the Gentiles
[3084.52 --> 3085.14]  I will
[3085.14 --> 3085.56]  sing the
[3085.56 --> 3085.90]  praises
[3085.90 --> 3086.40]  of your
[3086.40 --> 3086.70]  name
[3086.70 --> 3087.90]  again
[3087.90 --> 3088.38]  it says
[3088.38 --> 3088.86]  rejoice
[3088.86 --> 3089.80]  you Gentiles
[3089.80 --> 3090.28]  with his
[3090.28 --> 3090.70]  people
[3090.70 --> 3091.48]  and again
[3091.48 --> 3092.10]  praise the
[3092.10 --> 3092.42]  Lord
[3092.42 --> 3092.98]  all you
[3092.98 --> 3093.52]  Gentiles
[3093.52 --> 3093.96]  let all
[3093.96 --> 3094.54]  the peoples
[3094.54 --> 3095.68]  extol him
[3095.68 --> 3096.20]  and again
[3096.20 --> 3097.08]  Isaiah says
[3097.08 --> 3097.82]  the root
[3097.82 --> 3098.38]  of Jesse
[3098.38 --> 3099.10]  will spring
[3099.10 --> 3099.32]  up
[3099.32 --> 3099.94]  one who
[3099.94 --> 3100.72]  will arise
[3100.72 --> 3101.28]  to rule
[3101.28 --> 3101.78]  over the
[3101.78 --> 3102.20]  nations
[3102.20 --> 3103.12]  in him
[3103.12 --> 3104.20]  the Gentiles
[3104.20 --> 3104.94]  will hope
[3104.94 --> 3107.32]  may the
[3107.32 --> 3107.96]  God of
[3107.96 --> 3108.38]  hope
[3108.38 --> 3109.28]  fill you
[3109.28 --> 3109.80]  with all
[3109.80 --> 3110.28]  joy
[3110.28 --> 3111.02]  and peace
[3111.02 --> 3111.46]  as you
[3111.46 --> 3111.94]  trust
[3111.94 --> 3113.28]  in him
[3113.28 --> 3113.88]  so that
[3113.88 --> 3114.28]  you may
[3114.28 --> 3114.90]  overflow
[3114.90 --> 3116.02]  with hope
[3116.02 --> 3116.70]  by the
[3116.70 --> 3117.14]  power
[3117.14 --> 3117.96]  of the
[3117.96 --> 3118.32]  Holy
[3118.32 --> 3119.02]  Spirit
[3119.02 --> 3120.58]  this is
[3120.58 --> 3120.86]  the word
[3120.86 --> 3121.06]  of the
[3121.06 --> 3121.30]  Lord
[3121.30 --> 3128.42]  and so
[3128.42 --> 3129.02]  I hope
[3129.02 --> 3129.60]  that it
[3129.60 --> 3130.26]  is
[3130.26 --> 3131.16]  abundantly
[3131.16 --> 3131.56]  clear
[3131.56 --> 3132.28]  even on
[3132.28 --> 3132.94]  the first
[3132.94 --> 3133.76]  reading
[3133.76 --> 3135.52]  but this
[3135.52 --> 3136.16]  text
[3136.16 --> 3137.74]  is about
[3137.74 --> 3138.48]  what our
[3138.48 --> 3139.16]  unity
[3139.16 --> 3139.92]  together
[3139.92 --> 3141.30]  looks like
[3141.30 --> 3141.68]  and how
[3141.68 --> 3142.16]  it is
[3142.16 --> 3143.12]  expressed
[3143.12 --> 3144.90]  and what I
[3144.90 --> 3145.12]  want to
[3145.12 --> 3145.78]  suggest to
[3145.78 --> 3146.18]  you
[3146.18 --> 3146.80]  out of
[3146.80 --> 3147.60]  chapter 15
[3147.60 --> 3148.26]  in connection
[3148.26 --> 3148.74]  to this
[3148.74 --> 3149.66]  larger story
[3149.66 --> 3151.14]  that we've
[3151.14 --> 3151.54]  been living
[3151.54 --> 3151.92]  in
[3151.92 --> 3153.46]  that maturity
[3153.46 --> 3154.62]  in the
[3154.62 --> 3155.12]  gospel
[3155.12 --> 3156.28]  builds
[3156.28 --> 3157.14]  unity
[3157.14 --> 3158.02]  around
[3158.02 --> 3158.76]  the gospel
[3158.76 --> 3160.96]  that's the
[3160.96 --> 3161.84]  big idea
[3161.84 --> 3162.28]  or the
[3162.28 --> 3162.90]  theme
[3162.90 --> 3163.54]  for this
[3163.54 --> 3163.80]  morning
[3163.80 --> 3164.32]  maturity
[3164.32 --> 3165.18]  in the
[3165.18 --> 3165.56]  gospel
[3165.56 --> 3166.04]  builds
[3166.04 --> 3166.68]  unity
[3166.68 --> 3167.80]  around
[3167.80 --> 3168.80]  the gospel
[3168.80 --> 3170.92]  chapters
[3170.92 --> 3171.88]  14
[3171.88 --> 3172.72]  this
[3172.72 --> 3173.16]  first
[3173.16 --> 3173.50]  part
[3173.50 --> 3173.72]  of
[3173.72 --> 3174.08]  chapter
[3174.08 --> 3174.62]  15
[3174.62 --> 3176.26]  about
[3176.26 --> 3177.00]  what it
[3177.00 --> 3177.78]  looks like
[3177.78 --> 3178.60]  to
[3178.60 --> 3179.58]  mature
[3179.58 --> 3180.64]  in the
[3180.64 --> 3181.06]  gospel
[3181.06 --> 3182.56]  right
[3182.56 --> 3182.94]  Paul
[3182.94 --> 3183.54]  has been
[3183.54 --> 3184.50]  contrasting
[3184.50 --> 3185.22]  his language
[3185.22 --> 3185.80]  is the
[3185.80 --> 3186.14]  weaker
[3186.14 --> 3186.60]  brother
[3186.60 --> 3187.26]  or sister
[3187.26 --> 3188.42]  with the
[3188.42 --> 3189.22]  stronger
[3189.22 --> 3189.76]  brother
[3189.76 --> 3190.48]  or sister
[3190.48 --> 3191.62]  and what
[3191.62 --> 3192.14]  we've said
[3192.14 --> 3192.62]  is what that
[3192.62 --> 3193.32]  really means
[3193.32 --> 3194.04]  those who
[3194.04 --> 3194.88]  are less
[3194.88 --> 3195.42]  mature
[3195.42 --> 3196.34]  in faith
[3196.34 --> 3196.92]  and those
[3196.92 --> 3197.24]  who are
[3197.24 --> 3197.66]  more
[3197.66 --> 3198.18]  mature
[3198.18 --> 3198.94]  in the
[3198.94 --> 3199.28]  faith
[3199.28 --> 3200.74]  and we've
[3200.74 --> 3201.18]  defined
[3201.18 --> 3201.60]  this
[3201.60 --> 3202.30]  maturity
[3202.30 --> 3203.46]  as
[3203.46 --> 3204.16]  allowing
[3204.16 --> 3205.08]  the
[3205.08 --> 3205.78]  scope
[3205.78 --> 3206.32]  of the
[3206.32 --> 3206.74]  gospel
[3206.74 --> 3207.18]  to
[3207.18 --> 3208.12]  pervade
[3208.12 --> 3208.70]  every
[3208.70 --> 3209.32]  corner
[3209.32 --> 3209.94]  of
[3209.94 --> 3210.74]  our
[3210.74 --> 3211.34]  hearts
[3211.34 --> 3212.28]  and lives
[3212.28 --> 3214.26]  that
[3214.26 --> 3214.72]  means
[3214.72 --> 3215.10]  then
[3215.10 --> 3215.28]  that
[3215.28 --> 3215.52]  the
[3215.52 --> 3216.18]  truths
[3216.18 --> 3216.74]  of who
[3216.74 --> 3217.04]  God
[3217.04 --> 3217.56]  is
[3217.56 --> 3218.08]  the
[3218.08 --> 3218.58]  truth
[3218.58 --> 3218.88]  about
[3218.88 --> 3219.12]  what
[3219.12 --> 3219.28]  he
[3219.28 --> 3219.46]  has
[3219.46 --> 3219.84]  done
[3219.84 --> 3220.10]  in
[3220.10 --> 3220.54]  Christ
[3220.54 --> 3221.00]  Jesus
[3221.00 --> 3221.56]  and
[3221.56 --> 3221.76]  how
[3221.76 --> 3222.04]  we
[3222.04 --> 3222.26]  have
[3222.26 --> 3222.44]  been
[3222.44 --> 3223.26]  reconciled
[3223.26 --> 3223.42]  to
[3223.42 --> 3223.82]  God
[3223.82 --> 3224.22]  through
[3224.22 --> 3224.70]  Jesus
[3224.70 --> 3225.24]  life
[3225.24 --> 3225.86]  death
[3225.86 --> 3226.14]  and
[3226.14 --> 3226.68]  resurrection
[3226.68 --> 3227.68]  those
[3227.68 --> 3229.02]  realities
[3229.02 --> 3229.62]  have
[3229.62 --> 3230.34]  changed
[3230.34 --> 3231.06]  everything
[3231.06 --> 3231.66]  about
[3231.66 --> 3231.90]  our
[3231.90 --> 3232.42]  perception
[3232.42 --> 3232.88]  of
[3232.88 --> 3233.08]  and
[3233.08 --> 3233.58]  experience
[3233.58 --> 3234.14]  of
[3234.14 --> 3235.04]  reality
[3235.04 --> 3235.76]  in the
[3235.76 --> 3236.08]  way that
[3236.08 --> 3236.60]  we live
[3236.60 --> 3237.36]  and work
[3237.36 --> 3238.16]  and worship
[3238.16 --> 3240.18]  and in short
[3240.18 --> 3240.90]  that the gospel
[3240.90 --> 3242.22]  changes everything
[3242.22 --> 3244.26]  and we let
[3244.26 --> 3244.82]  the gospel
[3244.82 --> 3245.84]  change everything
[3245.84 --> 3246.82]  about our
[3246.82 --> 3247.40]  lives
[3247.40 --> 3247.78]  and how we
[3247.78 --> 3248.38]  live together
[3248.38 --> 3249.68]  that is
[3249.68 --> 3250.02]  what it
[3250.02 --> 3250.80]  means to
[3250.80 --> 3251.60]  mature
[3251.60 --> 3253.92]  now the
[3253.92 --> 3254.48]  particular
[3254.48 --> 3255.66]  locus
[3255.66 --> 3256.14]  of the
[3256.14 --> 3256.76]  conversation
[3256.76 --> 3257.62]  for Paul
[3257.62 --> 3258.24]  has been
[3258.24 --> 3258.80]  around
[3258.80 --> 3259.64]  what he
[3259.64 --> 3260.42]  has called
[3260.42 --> 3261.46]  disputable
[3261.46 --> 3262.20]  matters
[3262.20 --> 3263.36]  if your
[3263.36 --> 3263.78]  bibles are
[3263.78 --> 3264.16]  open
[3264.16 --> 3264.90]  you can
[3264.90 --> 3265.32]  see in
[3265.32 --> 3267.16]  chapter 14
[3267.16 --> 3268.34]  verse 1
[3268.34 --> 3269.24]  this conversation
[3269.24 --> 3270.06]  started with
[3270.06 --> 3270.86]  Paul writing
[3270.86 --> 3272.06]  accept the
[3272.06 --> 3272.72]  one whose
[3272.72 --> 3273.34]  faith is
[3273.34 --> 3273.72]  weak
[3273.72 --> 3274.24]  without
[3274.24 --> 3274.98]  quarreling
[3274.98 --> 3275.46]  over
[3275.46 --> 3276.36]  disputable
[3276.36 --> 3277.46]  matters
[3277.46 --> 3279.00]  so accept
[3279.00 --> 3279.54]  the one
[3279.54 --> 3280.54]  who is
[3280.54 --> 3281.24]  less mature
[3281.24 --> 3281.74]  in their
[3281.74 --> 3282.12]  faith
[3282.12 --> 3282.52]  without
[3282.52 --> 3283.12]  quarreling
[3283.12 --> 3283.48]  over
[3283.48 --> 3284.48]  disputable
[3284.48 --> 3285.20]  matters
[3285.20 --> 3285.66]  and we've
[3285.66 --> 3285.80]  been
[3285.80 --> 3286.56]  careful
[3286.56 --> 3287.32]  in this
[3287.32 --> 3287.76]  time
[3287.76 --> 3288.76]  to define
[3288.76 --> 3289.28]  those
[3289.28 --> 3290.30]  disputable
[3290.30 --> 3290.86]  matters
[3290.86 --> 3292.16]  as things
[3292.16 --> 3293.00]  about which
[3293.00 --> 3293.84]  scripture
[3293.84 --> 3294.86]  seems to
[3294.86 --> 3295.92]  see two
[3295.92 --> 3296.62]  ways
[3296.62 --> 3296.98]  either
[3296.98 --> 3297.70]  explicitly
[3297.70 --> 3299.68]  or implicitly
[3299.68 --> 3300.22]  through a
[3300.22 --> 3300.98]  contrasting
[3300.98 --> 3301.98]  of experience
[3301.98 --> 3303.52]  the big
[3303.52 --> 3303.88]  three
[3303.88 --> 3304.74]  in these
[3304.74 --> 3305.18]  chapters
[3305.18 --> 3305.70]  have been
[3305.70 --> 3306.38]  the eating
[3306.38 --> 3306.88]  of meat
[3306.88 --> 3307.28]  versus
[3307.28 --> 3307.80]  vegetables
[3307.80 --> 3308.92]  or celebrating
[3308.92 --> 3309.76]  holy days
[3309.76 --> 3310.22]  or drinking
[3310.22 --> 3310.70]  wine
[3310.70 --> 3311.84]  others
[3311.84 --> 3312.68]  in scripture
[3312.68 --> 3313.40]  pop up as
[3313.40 --> 3314.22]  meat sacrifice
[3314.22 --> 3314.84]  to idols
[3314.84 --> 3315.62]  or the
[3315.62 --> 3316.18]  conversation
[3316.18 --> 3316.84]  about marriage
[3316.84 --> 3317.68]  or celibacy
[3317.68 --> 3318.48]  even
[3318.48 --> 3319.28]  circumcision
[3319.28 --> 3321.36]  and in the
[3321.36 --> 3321.96]  contrast of
[3321.96 --> 3322.54]  experience
[3322.54 --> 3323.14]  we've talked
[3323.14 --> 3323.98]  about baptism
[3323.98 --> 3324.76]  particularly
[3324.76 --> 3325.72]  infant baptism
[3325.72 --> 3325.96]  versus
[3325.96 --> 3326.32]  believers
[3326.32 --> 3326.72]  baptism
[3326.72 --> 3328.00]  or even
[3328.00 --> 3328.96]  the debatable
[3328.96 --> 3329.64]  matter of
[3329.64 --> 3330.40]  women in
[3330.40 --> 3331.12]  church office
[3331.12 --> 3333.32]  now of course
[3333.32 --> 3333.78]  these aren't
[3333.78 --> 3334.58]  any controversial
[3334.58 --> 3335.24]  conversations
[3335.24 --> 3335.80]  at all
[3335.80 --> 3339.00]  but I think
[3339.00 --> 3339.38]  you can see
[3339.38 --> 3339.78]  why Paul
[3339.78 --> 3340.34]  calls them
[3340.34 --> 3341.12]  disputable
[3341.12 --> 3342.16]  matters
[3342.16 --> 3344.42]  and in all
[3344.42 --> 3344.90]  of these
[3344.90 --> 3345.56]  things
[3345.56 --> 3346.42]  there is
[3346.42 --> 3348.22]  an experienced
[3348.22 --> 3349.12]  movement
[3349.12 --> 3350.70]  towards maturity
[3350.70 --> 3351.34]  that is
[3351.34 --> 3352.34]  an experienced
[3352.34 --> 3352.90]  movement
[3352.90 --> 3353.68]  towards the
[3353.68 --> 3355.36]  increasing scope
[3355.36 --> 3356.18]  of the effect
[3356.18 --> 3357.12]  of the gospel
[3357.12 --> 3358.16]  in our everyday
[3358.16 --> 3358.68]  lives
[3358.68 --> 3361.00]  as we round
[3361.00 --> 3361.66]  out this
[3361.66 --> 3362.18]  discussion
[3362.18 --> 3362.92]  now in
[3362.92 --> 3363.72]  chapter 15
[3363.72 --> 3364.94]  here's what I
[3364.94 --> 3365.26]  hope we
[3365.26 --> 3365.66]  begin to
[3365.66 --> 3365.98]  see
[3365.98 --> 3368.02]  that it
[3368.02 --> 3368.50]  is in
[3368.50 --> 3369.38]  the movement
[3369.38 --> 3370.42]  towards
[3370.42 --> 3371.34]  maturity
[3371.34 --> 3372.78]  around the
[3372.78 --> 3373.30]  gospel
[3373.30 --> 3374.58]  that unity
[3374.58 --> 3375.50]  is built
[3375.50 --> 3378.40]  and I want
[3378.40 --> 3378.74]  you to hear
[3378.74 --> 3379.16]  that really
[3379.16 --> 3379.56]  carefully
[3379.56 --> 3379.90]  right
[3379.90 --> 3381.64]  because unity
[3381.64 --> 3382.94]  is not
[3382.94 --> 3384.26]  in maturity
[3384.26 --> 3386.52]  unity
[3386.52 --> 3387.56]  is in
[3387.56 --> 3388.46]  maturing
[3388.46 --> 3390.92]  right
[3390.92 --> 3391.32]  unity
[3391.32 --> 3392.04]  isn't in
[3392.04 --> 3392.96]  all being
[3392.96 --> 3393.52]  at the same
[3393.52 --> 3394.34]  spot at the
[3394.34 --> 3394.64]  end
[3394.64 --> 3394.94]  and all
[3394.94 --> 3395.38]  agreeing
[3395.38 --> 3395.84]  and being
[3395.84 --> 3396.20]  of one
[3396.20 --> 3396.66]  mind
[3396.66 --> 3397.44]  unity
[3397.44 --> 3398.64]  is how
[3398.64 --> 3399.64]  we move
[3399.64 --> 3400.20]  together
[3400.20 --> 3401.86]  to that
[3401.86 --> 3402.30]  place
[3402.30 --> 3402.86]  how we
[3402.86 --> 3403.48]  are grown
[3403.48 --> 3404.04]  and how
[3404.04 --> 3405.12]  we grow
[3405.12 --> 3406.38]  because
[3406.38 --> 3406.94]  sometimes
[3406.94 --> 3407.38]  right
[3407.38 --> 3408.06]  in our
[3408.06 --> 3408.48]  world
[3408.48 --> 3409.02]  today
[3409.02 --> 3410.88]  and in
[3410.88 --> 3411.10]  our
[3411.10 --> 3411.56]  churches
[3411.56 --> 3412.02]  today
[3412.02 --> 3413.12]  unity
[3413.12 --> 3414.70]  is defined
[3414.70 --> 3415.34]  as
[3415.34 --> 3416.06]  or is
[3416.06 --> 3416.56]  required
[3416.56 --> 3417.52]  to have
[3417.52 --> 3418.46]  the same
[3418.46 --> 3418.92]  opinion
[3418.92 --> 3419.86]  on everything
[3419.86 --> 3422.50]  instead
[3422.50 --> 3424.00]  unity
[3424.00 --> 3425.70]  is expressed
[3425.70 --> 3426.46]  in the
[3426.46 --> 3427.00]  journey
[3427.00 --> 3427.82]  of
[3427.82 --> 3428.56]  maturity
[3428.56 --> 3429.92]  and so
[3429.92 --> 3430.22]  of course
[3430.22 --> 3430.66]  there's still
[3430.66 --> 3431.24]  a goal
[3431.24 --> 3431.70]  right
[3431.70 --> 3432.08]  there's still
[3432.08 --> 3432.66]  a movement
[3432.66 --> 3433.18]  towards
[3433.18 --> 3434.94]  which we are
[3434.94 --> 3435.48]  directing
[3435.48 --> 3436.10]  that
[3436.10 --> 3436.48]  maturity
[3436.48 --> 3437.86]  but how
[3437.86 --> 3438.74]  we act
[3438.74 --> 3439.32]  on the
[3439.32 --> 3439.76]  path
[3439.76 --> 3440.30]  of that
[3440.30 --> 3440.92]  direction
[3440.92 --> 3441.84]  is what
[3441.84 --> 3442.54]  determines
[3442.54 --> 3443.06]  our
[3443.06 --> 3443.58]  unity
[3443.58 --> 3446.18]  not the
[3446.18 --> 3446.36]  goal
[3446.36 --> 3446.82]  itself
[3446.82 --> 3449.50]  maturity
[3449.50 --> 3450.72]  in the
[3450.72 --> 3451.26]  gospel
[3451.26 --> 3452.40]  builds
[3452.40 --> 3453.08]  unity
[3453.08 --> 3453.98]  around
[3453.98 --> 3454.40]  the
[3454.40 --> 3454.86]  gospel
[3454.86 --> 3455.70]  and so
[3455.70 --> 3455.88]  then
[3455.88 --> 3456.66]  the core
[3456.66 --> 3457.20]  of our
[3457.20 --> 3457.60]  unity
[3457.60 --> 3458.28]  is the
[3458.28 --> 3458.54]  gospel
[3458.54 --> 3459.14]  of Jesus
[3459.14 --> 3460.00]  not the
[3460.00 --> 3460.38]  end
[3460.38 --> 3460.96]  of our
[3460.96 --> 3461.52]  community
[3461.52 --> 3462.06]  together
[3462.06 --> 3464.28]  I'm suggesting
[3464.94 --> 3469.14]  provide for
[3469.14 --> 3469.54]  us
[3469.54 --> 3470.76]  a road
[3470.76 --> 3471.24]  map
[3471.24 --> 3471.62]  for
[3471.62 --> 3471.94]  what
[3471.94 --> 3472.46]  gospel
[3472.46 --> 3473.14]  unity
[3473.14 --> 3474.54]  looks like
[3474.54 --> 3476.48]  as we
[3476.48 --> 3476.92]  together
[3476.92 --> 3477.62]  pursue
[3477.62 --> 3478.94]  maturity

[3482.90 --> 3483.28]  what I
[3483.28 --> 3484.48]  say
[3484.48 --> 3486.42]  we don't
[3486.42 --> 3487.06]  all have

[3490.32 --> 3492.20]  we have
[3492.20 --> 3492.74]  to build
[3492.74 --> 3493.00]  our

[3501.96 --> 3502.62]  four
[3502.62 --> 3503.64]  things
[3503.64 --> 3506.14]  unity

[4042.84 --> 4043.04]  that
[4043.04 --> 4043.44]  means
[4043.44 --> 4044.54]  Paul
[4044.54 --> 4044.92]  says
[4044.92 --> 4045.08]  is
[4045.08 --> 4045.24]  that
[4045.24 --> 4045.38]  we
[4045.38 --> 4046.22]  please
[4046.22 --> 4046.90]  them
[4046.90 --> 4048.20]  that
[4048.20 --> 4048.34]  is
[4048.34 --> 4048.74]  we
[4048.74 --> 4049.22]  want
[4049.22 --> 4049.74]  their
[4049.74 --> 4050.44]  good
[4050.44 --> 4051.12]  we
[4051.12 --> 4051.64]  long
[4051.64 --> 4051.96]  for
[4051.96 --> 4052.26]  their
[4052.26 --> 4053.14]  joy
[4053.14 --> 4053.60]  and
[4053.60 --> 4053.76]  the
[4053.76 --> 4054.04]  reason
[4054.04 --> 4054.26]  we
[4054.26 --> 4054.50]  do
[4054.50 --> 4054.74]  that
[4054.74 --> 4054.90]  is
[4054.90 --> 4055.08]  not
[4055.08 --> 4055.36]  because
[4055.36 --> 4055.52]  of
[4055.52 --> 4055.96]  ulterior
[4055.96 --> 4056.46]  motives
[4056.46 --> 4056.70]  it's
[4056.70 --> 4056.84]  not
[4056.84 --> 4057.12]  because
[4057.12 --> 4057.32]  we're
[4057.32 --> 4057.66]  secretly
[4057.66 --> 4057.98]  trying
[4057.98 --> 4058.10]  to
[4058.10 --> 4058.22]  get
[4058.22 --> 4058.36]  them
[4058.36 --> 4058.48]  to

[4059.06 --> 4059.54]  on
[4059.54 --> 4059.86]  Sunday
[4059.86 --> 4060.14]  and
[4060.14 --> 4060.78]  donate
[4060.78 --> 4061.02]  to
[4061.02 --> 4061.50]  Newground
[4061.50 --> 4061.84]  because
[4061.84 --> 4062.18]  Newground
[4062.18 --> 4062.38]  is
[4062.38 --> 4062.76]  awesome
[4062.76 --> 4063.30]  although
[4063.30 --> 4063.74]  all of
[4063.74 --> 4063.88]  that
[4063.88 --> 4064.04]  is
[4064.04 --> 4064.30]  kind
[4064.30 --> 4064.42]  of
[4064.42 --> 4064.74]  true
[4064.74 --> 4065.56]  right
[4065.56 --> 4065.70]  we
[4065.70 --> 4065.92]  do
[4065.92 --> 4066.18]  want
[4066.18 --> 4066.34]  them
[4066.34 --> 4066.58]  here
[4066.58 --> 4066.76]  we
[4066.76 --> 4066.94]  do
[4066.94 --> 4067.14]  want
[4067.14 --> 4067.26]  them
[4067.26 --> 4067.38]  to

[4067.66 --> 4067.86]  these
[4067.86 --> 4068.24]  amazing
[4068.24 --> 4068.72]  ministries
[4068.72 --> 4069.34]  but
[4069.34 --> 4069.64]  that's
[4069.64 --> 4069.84]  not
[4069.84 --> 4070.04]  the
[4070.04 --> 4070.54]  reason
[4070.54 --> 4071.26]  the
[4071.26 --> 4071.58]  reason
[4071.58 --> 4071.92]  is
[4071.92 --> 4072.40]  simply
[4072.40 --> 4073.06]  because
[4073.06 --> 4073.40]  it
[4073.40 --> 4073.88]  is
[4073.88 --> 4074.48]  their
[4074.48 --> 4075.22]  good
[4075.22 --> 4076.24]  that
[4076.24 --> 4076.36]  we
[4076.36 --> 4076.50]  are
[4076.50 --> 4076.90]  pursuing
[4076.90 --> 4079.16]  but
[4079.16 --> 4079.34]  here's
[4079.34 --> 4079.56]  the thing
[4079.56 --> 4079.74]  about
[4079.74 --> 4079.94]  that
[4079.94 --> 4080.14]  right
[4080.14 --> 4081.68]  and
[4081.68 --> 4081.76]  if
[4081.76 --> 4081.86]  you
[4081.86 --> 4081.94]  are
[4081.94 --> 4082.06]  a
[4082.06 --> 4082.30]  parent
[4082.30 --> 4082.50]  of
[4082.50 --> 4083.16]  a
[4083.16 --> 4083.72]  young
[4083.72 --> 4084.10]  child
[4084.10 --> 4084.30]  or
[4084.30 --> 4084.82]  a

[4085.08 --> 4085.54]  child
[4085.54 --> 4085.68]  or
[4085.68 --> 4085.84]  maybe
[4085.84 --> 4086.04]  this
[4086.04 --> 4086.16]  is
[4086.16 --> 4086.40]  true
[4086.40 --> 4086.70]  of
[4086.70 --> 4087.08]  parents
[4087.08 --> 4087.34]  and
[4087.34 --> 4087.58]  children
[4087.58 --> 4087.82]  of
[4087.82 --> 4088.06]  all
[4088.06 --> 4088.42]  ages
[4088.42 --> 4088.94]  you
[4088.94 --> 4089.14]  know
[4089.14 --> 4089.36]  this
[4089.36 --> 4089.54]  is
[4089.54 --> 4089.94]  true
[4089.94 --> 4090.40]  right
[4090.40 --> 4091.20]  sometimes
[4091.20 --> 4092.26]  maturity
[4092.26 --> 4092.98]  is
[4092.98 --> 4093.40]  knowing
[4093.40 --> 4093.78]  that
[4093.78 --> 4093.98]  the
[4093.98 --> 4094.52]  hard
[4094.52 --> 4095.02]  thing
[4095.02 --> 4095.60]  is
[4095.60 --> 4095.88]  for
[4095.88 --> 4096.12]  your
[4096.12 --> 4096.60]  good
[4096.60 --> 4097.02]  rather
[4097.02 --> 4097.40]  than
[4097.40 --> 4097.60]  the
[4097.60 --> 4098.38]  expedient
[4098.38 --> 4098.82]  thing
[4098.82 --> 4100.76]  right
[4100.76 --> 4100.88]  have
[4100.88 --> 4100.98]  you
[4100.98 --> 4101.20]  ever
[4101.20 --> 4101.44]  heard
[4101.44 --> 4101.60]  your
[4101.60 --> 4101.94]  parents
[4101.94 --> 4102.38]  say
[4102.38 --> 4103.16]  this
[4103.16 --> 4103.36]  is
[4103.36 --> 4103.52]  for
[4103.52 --> 4103.72]  your
[4103.72 --> 4103.92]  own
[4103.92 --> 4104.22]  good
[4104.22 --> 4105.26]  and
[4105.26 --> 4105.38]  then
[4105.38 --> 4105.52]  they
[4105.52 --> 4105.74]  take
[4105.74 --> 4106.00]  away
[4106.00 --> 4106.18]  your
[4106.18 --> 4106.52]  Nintendo
[4106.52 --> 4106.94]  Switch
[4106.94 --> 4107.18]  or
[4107.18 --> 4107.44]  something
[4107.44 --> 4107.68]  like
[4107.68 --> 4107.94]  that
[4107.94 --> 4109.60]  now
[4109.60 --> 4109.70]  in
[4109.70 --> 4109.84]  that
[4109.84 --> 4110.06]  case
[4110.06 --> 4110.28]  maybe
[4110.28 --> 4110.46]  they
[4110.46 --> 4110.64]  mean
[4110.64 --> 4110.78]  it's
[4110.78 --> 4110.94]  for
[4110.94 --> 4111.18]  my
[4111.18 --> 4111.44]  good
[4111.44 --> 4111.72]  because
[4111.72 --> 4111.90]  it'll
[4111.90 --> 4112.04]  get
[4112.04 --> 4112.36]  quieter
[4112.36 --> 4112.54]  in
[4112.54 --> 4112.62]  the
[4112.62 --> 4112.84]  house
[4112.84 --> 4113.08]  but
[4113.08 --> 4115.14]  it
[4115.14 --> 4115.44]  takes
[4115.44 --> 4115.98]  maturity
[4115.98 --> 4116.98]  to
[4116.98 --> 4117.50]  see
[4117.50 --> 4117.84]  that
[4117.84 --> 4118.80]  discipline
[4118.80 --> 4119.46]  and
[4119.46 --> 4120.12]  correction
[4120.12 --> 4120.66]  are
[4120.66 --> 4121.22]  also
[4121.22 --> 4121.86]  for
[4121.86 --> 4122.66]  good
[4122.66 --> 4124.68]  now
[4124.68 --> 4124.84]  in
[4124.84 --> 4125.34]  faith
[4125.34 --> 4125.56]  in
[4125.56 --> 4125.70]  the
[4125.70 --> 4125.94]  life
[4125.94 --> 4126.20]  of
[4126.20 --> 4126.54]  faith
[4126.54 --> 4127.46]  oftentimes
[4127.46 --> 4128.14]  it
[4128.14 --> 4128.30]  is
[4128.30 --> 4128.50]  the
[4128.50 --> 4128.98]  hard
[4128.98 --> 4129.48]  way
[4129.48 --> 4130.10]  that
[4130.10 --> 4130.28]  is
[4130.28 --> 4130.62]  good
[4130.62 --> 4132.28]  maturity
[4132.28 --> 4132.98]  comes
[4132.98 --> 4133.74]  when we
[4133.74 --> 4134.02]  have
[4134.02 --> 4134.46]  a
[4134.46 --> 4135.34]  holy
[4135.34 --> 4136.52]  discontent
[4136.52 --> 4137.10]  with the
[4137.10 --> 4137.44]  present
[4137.44 --> 4138.10]  reality
[4138.10 --> 4138.76]  that
[4138.76 --> 4139.30]  motivates
[4139.30 --> 4139.76]  us
[4139.76 --> 4140.08]  through
[4140.08 --> 4140.64]  hardship
[4140.64 --> 4141.26]  or
[4141.26 --> 4141.70]  trial
[4141.70 --> 4143.28]  and it
[4143.28 --> 4143.60]  seems
[4143.60 --> 4144.54]  counterintuitive
[4144.54 --> 4145.08]  to the
[4145.08 --> 4145.96]  messaging
[4145.96 --> 4146.68]  of this
[4146.68 --> 4147.16]  world
[4147.16 --> 4147.46]  but
[4147.46 --> 4148.10]  really
[4148.10 --> 4148.54]  it is
[4148.54 --> 4148.76]  the
[4148.76 --> 4149.38]  cruciform
[4149.38 --> 4150.28]  life
[4150.28 --> 4150.60]  it is
[4150.60 --> 4150.80]  the
[4150.80 --> 4151.24]  daily
[4151.24 --> 4151.94]  dying
[4151.94 --> 4152.66]  and rising
[4152.66 --> 4153.26]  of self
[4153.26 --> 4153.80]  and taking
[4153.80 --> 4154.18]  up your
[4154.18 --> 4154.54]  cross
[4154.54 --> 4155.10]  and following
[4155.10 --> 4155.88]  after Jesus
[4155.88 --> 4156.52]  that is
[4156.52 --> 4157.02]  the good
[4157.02 --> 4157.54]  life
[4157.54 --> 4159.50]  and
[4159.50 --> 4159.84]  Christ
[4159.84 --> 4160.32]  actually
[4160.32 --> 4160.56]  is
[4160.56 --> 4160.70]  our
[4160.70 --> 4161.16]  example
[4161.16 --> 4161.42]  of
[4161.42 --> 4161.66]  this
[4161.66 --> 4161.82]  and
[4161.82 --> 4162.36]  Paul
[4162.36 --> 4162.74]  makes
[4162.74 --> 4163.04]  this
[4163.04 --> 4163.38]  point
[4163.38 --> 4163.68]  look at
[4163.68 --> 4163.88]  verse
[4163.88 --> 4164.24]  three
[4164.24 --> 4165.84]  for
[4165.84 --> 4166.12]  even
[4166.12 --> 4166.64]  Christ
[4166.64 --> 4167.00]  did
[4167.00 --> 4167.22]  not
[4167.22 --> 4167.60]  please
[4167.60 --> 4168.18]  himself
[4168.18 --> 4169.04]  but
[4169.04 --> 4169.44]  as
[4169.44 --> 4169.56]  it
[4169.56 --> 4169.72]  is
[4169.72 --> 4169.98]  written
[4169.98 --> 4170.50]  the
[4170.50 --> 4171.10]  insults
[4171.10 --> 4171.24]  of
[4171.24 --> 4171.56]  those
[4171.56 --> 4171.76]  who
[4171.76 --> 4172.20]  insult
[4172.20 --> 4172.54]  you
[4172.54 --> 4172.84]  have
[4172.84 --> 4173.26]  fallen
[4173.26 --> 4173.90]  on
[4173.90 --> 4174.64]  me
[4174.64 --> 4175.64]  right
[4175.64 --> 4176.16]  Christ
[4176.16 --> 4176.70]  bore
[4176.70 --> 4177.00]  the
[4177.00 --> 4177.68]  failings
[4177.68 --> 4178.24]  of
[4178.24 --> 4178.48]  the
[4178.48 --> 4178.74]  weak
[4178.74 --> 4179.18]  Christ
[4179.18 --> 4179.54]  took
[4179.54 --> 4179.76]  our
[4179.76 --> 4180.18]  sin
[4180.18 --> 4180.58]  and
[4180.58 --> 4180.76]  our
[4180.76 --> 4181.18]  flesh
[4181.18 --> 4181.52]  he
[4181.52 --> 4181.70]  took
[4181.70 --> 4181.84]  our
[4181.84 --> 4182.28]  punishment
[4182.28 --> 4182.58]  for
[4182.58 --> 4182.88]  sin
[4182.88 --> 4183.26]  and
[4183.26 --> 4183.60]  on
[4183.60 --> 4183.78]  the
[4183.78 --> 4184.14]  cross
[4184.14 --> 4184.38]  he
[4184.38 --> 4184.70]  bore
[4184.70 --> 4185.10]  our
[4185.10 --> 4185.80]  pain
[4185.80 --> 4186.50]  by his
[4186.50 --> 4186.98]  wounds
[4186.98 --> 4187.28]  we
[4187.28 --> 4187.74]  are
[4187.74 --> 4188.18]  healed
[4188.18 --> 4188.88]  he
[4188.88 --> 4189.28]  died
[4189.28 --> 4189.50]  the
[4189.50 --> 4189.78]  death
[4189.78 --> 4189.98]  that
[4189.98 --> 4190.24]  we
[4190.24 --> 4191.18]  deserve
[4191.18 --> 4192.56]  Hebrews
[4192.56 --> 4193.00]  12
[4193.00 --> 4193.24]  verse
[4193.24 --> 4193.50]  2
[4193.50 --> 4193.88]  says
[4193.88 --> 4194.14]  that
[4194.14 --> 4194.74]  for
[4194.74 --> 4194.92]  the
[4194.92 --> 4195.36]  joy
[4195.36 --> 4195.78]  set
[4195.78 --> 4196.40]  before
[4196.40 --> 4196.74]  him
[4196.74 --> 4197.06]  he
[4197.06 --> 4197.80]  endured
[4197.80 --> 4198.08]  the
[4198.08 --> 4198.60]  cross
[4198.60 --> 4199.50]  scorning
[4199.50 --> 4199.72]  its
[4199.72 --> 4200.08]  shame
[4200.08 --> 4201.50]  right
[4201.50 --> 4201.74]  for
[4201.74 --> 4201.94]  the
[4201.94 --> 4202.28]  greater
[4202.28 --> 4202.80]  good
[4202.80 --> 4203.24]  the
[4203.24 --> 4203.60]  greater
[4203.60 --> 4204.18]  joy
[4204.18 --> 4204.68]  Jesus
[4204.68 --> 4205.30]  endured
[4205.30 --> 4205.86]  the
[4205.86 --> 4206.32]  cross
[4206.32 --> 4207.26]  and
[4207.26 --> 4207.40]  in
[4207.40 --> 4207.68]  Jesus
[4207.68 --> 4208.12]  case
[4208.12 --> 4208.36]  just
[4208.36 --> 4208.50]  so
[4208.50 --> 4208.60]  you
[4208.60 --> 4208.84]  know
[4208.84 --> 4209.20]  the
[4209.20 --> 4209.48]  greater
[4209.48 --> 4209.86]  good
[4209.86 --> 4210.06]  that
[4210.06 --> 4210.34]  greater
[4210.34 --> 4210.84]  joy
[4210.84 --> 4211.44]  is
[4211.44 --> 4211.68]  you
[4211.68 --> 4211.86]  and
[4211.86 --> 4212.12]  me
[4212.12 --> 4213.08]  it's
[4213.08 --> 4213.26]  his
[4213.26 --> 4213.76]  bride
[4213.76 --> 4214.66]  right
[4214.66 --> 4214.86]  it's
[4214.86 --> 4215.34]  his bride
[4215.34 --> 4215.62]  being
[4215.62 --> 4216.44]  reconciled
[4216.44 --> 4216.82]  to the
[4216.82 --> 4217.16]  father
[4217.16 --> 4217.66]  it's
[4217.66 --> 4217.84]  for
[4217.84 --> 4218.22]  your
[4218.22 --> 4218.58]  sake
[4218.58 --> 4218.76]  that
[4218.76 --> 4219.00]  he
[4219.00 --> 4219.74]  endured
[4219.74 --> 4220.02]  the
[4220.02 --> 4220.40]  cross
[4220.40 --> 4220.84]  you
[4220.84 --> 4221.18]  are
[4221.18 --> 4221.46]  his
[4221.46 --> 4221.78]  greater
[4221.78 --> 4222.14]  good
[4222.14 --> 4222.32]  and
[4222.32 --> 4222.50]  by
[4222.50 --> 4223.36]  reclaiming
[4223.36 --> 4223.54]  you
[4223.54 --> 4223.76]  by
[4223.76 --> 4224.46]  reconciling
[4224.46 --> 4224.68]  you
[4224.68 --> 4225.10]  he
[4225.10 --> 4225.88]  glorifies
[4225.88 --> 4226.12]  the
[4226.12 --> 4226.54]  father
[4226.54 --> 4227.96]  that's
[4227.96 --> 4228.16]  his
[4228.16 --> 4228.46]  greater
[4228.46 --> 4228.78]  good
[4228.78 --> 4230.42]  but it
[4230.42 --> 4230.56]  was
[4230.56 --> 4230.74]  through
[4230.74 --> 4230.88]  the
[4230.88 --> 4231.26]  cross
[4231.26 --> 4232.34]  the
[4232.34 --> 4232.74]  Christian
[4232.74 --> 4233.16]  life
[4233.16 --> 4233.42]  is
[4233.42 --> 4234.06]  about
[4234.06 --> 4234.44]  doing
[4234.44 --> 4234.88]  good
[4234.88 --> 4235.26]  even
[4235.26 --> 4235.54]  when
[4235.54 --> 4235.70]  it
[4235.70 --> 4236.32]  requires
[4236.32 --> 4237.34]  you
[4237.34 --> 4237.86]  taking
[4237.86 --> 4238.26]  up
[4238.26 --> 4238.50]  your
[4238.50 --> 4239.00]  cross
[4239.00 --> 4239.44]  even
[4239.44 --> 4239.60]  when
[4239.60 --> 4239.78]  it's
[4239.78 --> 4240.10]  hard
[4240.10 --> 4240.66]  it's
[4240.66 --> 4240.88]  about
[4240.88 --> 4241.40]  allowing
[4241.40 --> 4241.90]  God
[4241.90 --> 4242.08]  to
[4242.08 --> 4242.66]  define
[4242.66 --> 4242.96]  what
[4242.96 --> 4243.14]  is
[4243.14 --> 4243.48]  good
[4243.48 --> 4244.04]  even
[4244.04 --> 4244.26]  if
[4244.26 --> 4244.50]  that
[4244.50 --> 4245.16]  contradicts
[4245.16 --> 4245.34]  my
[4245.34 --> 4246.00]  desires
[4246.00 --> 4247.00]  or my
[4247.00 --> 4247.16]  own
[4247.16 --> 4247.68]  ideas
[4247.68 --> 4249.86]  but a
[4249.86 --> 4250.42]  gospel
[4250.42 --> 4251.04]  unity
[4251.04 --> 4252.32]  then is a
[4252.32 --> 4252.90]  group of
[4252.90 --> 4254.14]  people doing
[4254.14 --> 4254.80]  this and
[4254.80 --> 4255.80]  pursuing this
[4255.80 --> 4256.34]  together
[4256.34 --> 4257.24]  and again
[4257.24 --> 4257.90]  right there's
[4257.90 --> 4259.06]  something incredibly
[4259.06 --> 4259.68]  compelling
[4259.68 --> 4261.12]  about people
[4261.12 --> 4261.80]  who witness
[4261.80 --> 4262.76]  this truth
[4262.76 --> 4263.36]  in their
[4263.36 --> 4264.46]  life together
[4264.46 --> 4265.30]  people who
[4265.30 --> 4266.48]  will sacrifice
[4266.48 --> 4267.48]  for their
[4267.48 --> 4267.82]  neighbor
[4267.82 --> 4268.32]  who will
[4268.32 --> 4269.12]  put others
[4269.12 --> 4269.54]  first
[4269.54 --> 4270.08]  people who
[4270.08 --> 4270.86]  will mourn
[4270.86 --> 4271.40]  alongside
[4271.40 --> 4272.26]  of those
[4272.26 --> 4272.92]  who mourn
[4272.92 --> 4273.46]  who will
[4273.46 --> 4273.68]  come
[4273.68 --> 4274.12]  alongside
[4274.12 --> 4274.60]  you
[4274.60 --> 4275.14]  in the
[4275.14 --> 4275.40]  dark
[4275.40 --> 4275.66]  night
[4275.66 --> 4275.96]  of the
[4275.96 --> 4276.24]  soul
[4276.24 --> 4276.60]  when you
[4276.60 --> 4277.02]  can no
[4277.02 --> 4277.32]  longer
[4277.32 --> 4277.74]  carry
[4277.74 --> 4278.02]  that
[4278.02 --> 4278.36]  cross
[4278.36 --> 4278.50]  that
[4278.50 --> 4278.58]  you
[4278.58 --> 4278.70]  have
[4278.70 --> 4278.80]  been
[4278.80 --> 4279.02]  given
[4279.02 --> 4279.68]  and like
[4279.68 --> 4280.02]  Simon
[4280.02 --> 4280.38]  they will
[4280.38 --> 4280.76]  say let
[4280.76 --> 4281.24]  me pick
[4281.24 --> 4281.54]  it up
[4281.54 --> 4282.24]  and carry
[4282.24 --> 4282.62]  it for
[4282.62 --> 4282.94]  you
[4282.94 --> 4284.32]  right that's
[4284.32 --> 4284.74]  a picture
[4284.74 --> 4285.62]  of the
[4285.62 --> 4286.04]  gospel
[4286.04 --> 4287.54]  that unity
[4287.54 --> 4288.68]  can be
[4288.68 --> 4289.26]  built on
[4289.26 --> 4291.66]  now the
[4291.66 --> 4292.18]  third thing
[4292.18 --> 4293.44]  about gospel
[4293.44 --> 4293.84]  unity
[4293.84 --> 4295.06]  is that it
[4295.06 --> 4295.70]  grows
[4295.70 --> 4296.48]  towards
[4296.48 --> 4297.44]  hope
[4297.44 --> 4297.86]  and here's
[4297.86 --> 4298.38]  verse 4
[4298.38 --> 4301.10]  everything
[4301.10 --> 4301.74]  that was
[4301.74 --> 4302.28]  written in
[4302.28 --> 4302.90]  the past
[4302.90 --> 4303.36]  was written
[4303.36 --> 4303.90]  to teach
[4303.90 --> 4304.24]  us
[4304.24 --> 4304.98]  so that
[4304.98 --> 4305.28]  through
[4305.28 --> 4305.54]  the
[4305.54 --> 4306.02]  endurance
[4306.02 --> 4306.38]  taught
[4306.38 --> 4306.68]  in the
[4306.68 --> 4307.02]  scriptures
[4307.02 --> 4307.76]  and the
[4307.76 --> 4308.26]  encouragement
[4308.26 --> 4309.00]  they provide
[4309.00 --> 4309.86]  we might
[4309.86 --> 4310.44]  have
[4310.44 --> 4311.56]  hope
[4311.56 --> 4314.18]  now remember
[4314.18 --> 4314.94]  our big
[4314.94 --> 4315.58]  idea this
[4315.58 --> 4316.08]  morning is
[4316.08 --> 4317.22]  that maturity
[4317.22 --> 4318.06]  in the
[4318.06 --> 4318.98]  gospel builds
[4318.98 --> 4320.36]  unity around
[4320.36 --> 4321.28]  the gospel
[4321.28 --> 4322.24]  and so
[4322.24 --> 4323.30]  inherent in
[4323.30 --> 4324.04]  the idea
[4324.04 --> 4324.56]  is that
[4324.56 --> 4325.16]  maturity
[4325.16 --> 4326.36]  requires
[4326.36 --> 4327.12]  growth
[4327.12 --> 4328.24]  maturity
[4328.24 --> 4329.32]  in the
[4329.32 --> 4329.82]  gospel
[4329.82 --> 4330.80]  is a
[4330.80 --> 4331.18]  building
[4331.18 --> 4332.24]  you up
[4332.24 --> 4334.36]  and part
[4334.36 --> 4335.24]  of what
[4335.24 --> 4336.26]  we read
[4336.26 --> 4337.20]  then is
[4337.20 --> 4338.28]  how we
[4338.28 --> 4339.06]  are built
[4339.06 --> 4339.90]  up
[4339.90 --> 4341.02]  everything
[4341.02 --> 4341.90]  that was
[4341.90 --> 4342.38]  written in
[4342.38 --> 4342.90]  the past
[4342.90 --> 4343.36]  was written
[4343.36 --> 4344.04]  to teach
[4344.04 --> 4344.48]  us
[4344.48 --> 4345.32]  Paul writes
[4345.32 --> 4346.88]  and so
[4346.88 --> 4347.66]  our building
[4347.66 --> 4348.74]  our mutual
[4348.74 --> 4349.76]  edification
[4349.76 --> 4350.86]  our maturing
[4350.86 --> 4352.26]  comes by
[4352.26 --> 4353.22]  being taught
[4353.22 --> 4354.54]  of and in
[4354.54 --> 4355.44]  and by
[4355.44 --> 4356.36]  the scriptures
[4356.36 --> 4357.18]  by the
[4357.18 --> 4357.46]  word of
[4357.46 --> 4357.80]  God
[4357.80 --> 4359.08]  the life
[4359.08 --> 4359.64]  of gospel
[4359.64 --> 4360.20]  unity
[4360.20 --> 4361.78]  isn't one
[4361.78 --> 4362.56]  of accomplishment
[4362.56 --> 4363.16]  it's one
[4363.16 --> 4363.82]  of growing
[4363.82 --> 4364.90]  one of being
[4364.90 --> 4365.38]  taught
[4365.38 --> 4365.72]  one of
[4365.72 --> 4366.34]  constantly
[4366.34 --> 4367.22]  maturing
[4367.22 --> 4368.06]  and constantly
[4368.06 --> 4368.80]  growing
[4368.80 --> 4369.36]  and so
[4369.36 --> 4370.16]  that means
[4370.16 --> 4370.82]  we must
[4370.82 --> 4371.90]  constantly
[4371.90 --> 4372.44]  be
[4372.44 --> 4373.26]  in
[4373.26 --> 4373.94]  God's
[4373.94 --> 4374.48]  word
[4374.48 --> 4375.58]  we must
[4375.58 --> 4376.16]  constantly
[4376.16 --> 4376.88]  be searching
[4376.88 --> 4377.86]  the scriptures
[4377.86 --> 4378.40]  we must
[4378.40 --> 4379.08]  be like
[4379.08 --> 4379.88]  the Berean
[4379.88 --> 4380.28]  church
[4380.28 --> 4380.80]  in Acts
[4380.80 --> 4381.34]  17
[4381.34 --> 4382.40]  that tests
[4382.40 --> 4383.28]  to see
[4383.28 --> 4383.88]  that what
[4383.88 --> 4384.48]  the apostles
[4384.48 --> 4384.98]  taught
[4384.98 --> 4385.64]  was true
[4385.64 --> 4387.62]  right
[4387.62 --> 4388.12]  they dug
[4388.12 --> 4388.64]  deep
[4388.64 --> 4389.76]  into the
[4389.76 --> 4390.10]  word
[4390.10 --> 4392.80]  and so
[4392.80 --> 4393.04]  let me
[4393.04 --> 4393.64]  ask you
[4393.64 --> 4395.26]  when was
[4395.26 --> 4395.58]  the last
[4395.58 --> 4396.02]  time you
[4396.02 --> 4396.30]  opened
[4396.30 --> 4396.48]  your
[4396.48 --> 4396.82]  bible
[4396.82 --> 4400.92]  and if
[4400.92 --> 4401.20]  it's been
[4401.20 --> 4401.66]  a while
[4401.66 --> 4402.90]  can I
[4402.90 --> 4403.34]  encourage
[4403.34 --> 4403.54]  you
[4403.54 --> 4403.80]  can I
[4403.80 --> 4404.24]  challenge
[4404.24 --> 4404.62]  you
[4404.62 --> 4405.12]  right
[4405.12 --> 4405.40]  make
[4405.40 --> 4405.82]  today
[4405.82 --> 4406.12]  day
[4406.12 --> 4406.54]  one
[4406.54 --> 4407.94]  of a
[4407.94 --> 4408.08]  new
[4408.08 --> 4408.68]  practice
[4408.68 --> 4409.70]  of a
[4409.70 --> 4409.98]  new way
[4409.98 --> 4410.48]  of being
[4410.48 --> 4412.54]  and let's
[4412.54 --> 4413.04]  be clear
[4413.04 --> 4413.26]  right
[4413.26 --> 4413.94]  Paul tells
[4413.94 --> 4414.76]  us exactly
[4414.76 --> 4415.46]  why this
[4415.46 --> 4416.40]  important
[4416.40 --> 4416.66]  right
[4416.66 --> 4416.98]  we are
[4416.98 --> 4417.42]  taught
[4417.42 --> 4418.02]  in the
[4418.02 --> 4418.42]  scriptures
[4418.42 --> 4419.74]  so that
[4419.74 --> 4420.36]  we might
[4420.36 --> 4420.96]  endure
[4420.96 --> 4422.88]  and it's
[4422.88 --> 4423.44]  an endurance
[4423.44 --> 4424.18]  that is
[4424.18 --> 4424.66]  taught
[4424.66 --> 4425.14]  in the
[4425.14 --> 4425.46]  scriptures
[4425.46 --> 4426.30]  and so
[4426.30 --> 4426.84]  we read
[4426.84 --> 4427.32]  about how
[4427.32 --> 4428.14]  they endured
[4428.14 --> 4428.80]  and how
[4428.80 --> 4429.28]  we might
[4429.28 --> 4429.74]  then apply
[4429.74 --> 4430.12]  that to
[4430.12 --> 4430.64]  ourselves
[4430.64 --> 4431.88]  and if
[4431.88 --> 4432.42]  it's true
[4432.42 --> 4433.16]  that Christians
[4433.16 --> 4433.86]  are called
[4433.86 --> 4434.52]  to do
[4434.52 --> 4435.30]  the good
[4435.30 --> 4435.70]  thing
[4435.70 --> 4436.12]  and not
[4436.12 --> 4437.06]  the expedient
[4437.06 --> 4437.42]  thing
[4437.42 --> 4437.72]  to do
[4437.72 --> 4438.12]  the right
[4438.12 --> 4438.48]  thing
[4438.48 --> 4439.06]  and not
[4439.06 --> 4439.52]  the easy
[4439.52 --> 4439.96]  thing
[4439.96 --> 4440.68]  Christians
[4440.68 --> 4441.20]  are going
[4441.20 --> 4441.52]  to have
[4441.52 --> 4442.04]  to learn
[4442.04 --> 4442.76]  endurance
[4442.76 --> 4444.48]  we're going
[4444.48 --> 4444.70]  to have
[4444.70 --> 4445.12]  to learn
[4445.12 --> 4445.74]  perseverance
[4445.74 --> 4447.36]  and if
[4447.36 --> 4447.98]  it's true
[4447.98 --> 4448.62]  as I've
[4448.62 --> 4449.00]  said in
[4449.00 --> 4449.54]  the past
[4449.54 --> 4450.06]  and would
[4450.06 --> 4450.50]  contend
[4450.50 --> 4451.10]  that it
[4451.10 --> 4451.78]  is only
[4451.78 --> 4452.44]  going to
[4452.44 --> 4453.06]  get more
[4453.06 --> 4453.42]  and more
[4453.42 --> 4453.86]  difficult
[4453.86 --> 4454.28]  to be
[4454.28 --> 4454.66]  Christian
[4454.66 --> 4455.28]  in the
[4455.28 --> 4455.46]  world
[4455.46 --> 4455.82]  today
[4455.82 --> 4456.50]  I think
[4456.50 --> 4456.88]  we really
[4456.88 --> 4457.32]  need to
[4457.32 --> 4457.90]  reclaim
[4457.90 --> 4458.92]  this identity
[4458.92 --> 4460.00]  of practice
[4460.00 --> 4460.86]  of spiritual
[4460.86 --> 4461.32]  discipline
[4461.32 --> 4461.80]  we need
[4461.80 --> 4462.44]  to reclaim
[4462.44 --> 4462.76]  this
[4462.76 --> 4463.84]  discipleship
[4463.84 --> 4464.22]  this way
[4464.22 --> 4464.78]  of being
[4464.78 --> 4465.46]  in the
[4465.46 --> 4465.80]  world
[4465.80 --> 4467.10]  because you
[4467.10 --> 4467.24]  see
[4467.24 --> 4468.08]  in the
[4468.08 --> 4468.50]  scriptures
[4468.50 --> 4469.26]  there's
[4469.26 --> 4469.94]  encouragement
[4469.94 --> 4471.44]  in the
[4471.44 --> 4471.70]  scriptures
[4471.70 --> 4472.34]  we read
[4472.34 --> 4472.70]  about the
[4472.70 --> 4473.26]  power of
[4473.26 --> 4473.54]  God
[4473.54 --> 4474.08]  and the
[4474.08 --> 4474.40]  victory
[4474.40 --> 4474.82]  of God
[4474.82 --> 4475.08]  in the
[4475.08 --> 4475.38]  scriptures
[4475.38 --> 4476.20]  we read
[4476.20 --> 4476.70]  about how
[4476.70 --> 4477.58]  even when
[4477.58 --> 4478.72]  everything seems
[4478.72 --> 4479.52]  to be against
[4479.52 --> 4479.90]  us
[4479.90 --> 4480.68]  God is
[4480.68 --> 4481.60]  for us
[4481.60 --> 4482.40]  even though
[4482.40 --> 4483.26]  weeping may
[4483.26 --> 4484.10]  last for the
[4484.10 --> 4484.38]  night
[4484.38 --> 4485.24]  reading the
[4485.24 --> 4486.00]  Bible teaches
[4486.00 --> 4486.98]  us that joy
[4486.98 --> 4488.08]  comes in the
[4488.08 --> 4488.42]  morning
[4488.42 --> 4489.10]  right
[4489.10 --> 4489.60]  reading the
[4489.60 --> 4490.28]  Bible as
[4490.28 --> 4491.20]  God's very
[4491.20 --> 4492.34]  word spoken
[4492.34 --> 4493.20]  directly to
[4493.20 --> 4493.86]  your heart
[4493.86 --> 4494.90]  directly to
[4494.90 --> 4495.88]  your imagination
[4495.88 --> 4497.10]  teaches you
[4497.10 --> 4497.98]  that even
[4497.98 --> 4498.52]  when we are
[4498.52 --> 4499.26]  hard pressed
[4499.26 --> 4499.82]  on every
[4499.82 --> 4500.38]  side we
[4500.38 --> 4500.70]  are not
[4500.70 --> 4501.30]  crushed
[4501.30 --> 4502.50]  that even
[4502.50 --> 4503.02]  when we are
[4503.02 --> 4503.98]  perplexed
[4503.98 --> 4504.54]  we're not
[4504.54 --> 4505.04]  in despair
[4505.04 --> 4505.78]  even when we
[4505.78 --> 4506.60]  are persecuted
[4506.60 --> 4507.46]  we're never
[4507.46 --> 4507.92]  abandoned
[4507.92 --> 4508.78]  even when we
[4508.78 --> 4509.28]  are struck
[4509.28 --> 4510.18]  down we
[4510.18 --> 4510.80]  are not
[4510.80 --> 4511.66]  destroyed
[4511.66 --> 4514.88]  and I don't
[4514.88 --> 4515.24]  know about
[4515.24 --> 4516.90]  you but
[4516.90 --> 4517.46]  that comes
[4517.46 --> 4518.74]  together to
[4518.74 --> 4519.54]  give me
[4519.54 --> 4520.24]  hope
[4520.24 --> 4521.50]  that comes
[4521.50 --> 4522.06]  together to
[4522.06 --> 4522.54]  give me
[4522.54 --> 4523.56]  encouragement
[4523.56 --> 4525.84]  I was
[4525.84 --> 4526.24]  thinking about
[4526.24 --> 4526.58]  a way to
[4526.58 --> 4527.16]  illustrate this
[4527.16 --> 4527.54]  point and
[4527.54 --> 4527.80]  actually
[4527.80 --> 4529.74]  Josh did
[4529.74 --> 4530.40]  it for us
[4530.40 --> 4531.58]  yesterday at
[4531.58 --> 4532.06]  our baseball
[4532.06 --> 4533.08]  game so the
[4533.08 --> 4534.02]  isotopes is our
[4534.02 --> 4534.64]  church baseball
[4534.64 --> 4535.84]  team we had
[4535.84 --> 4536.32]  two games
[4536.32 --> 4537.60]  yesterday and
[4537.60 --> 4538.80]  Josh has a
[4538.80 --> 4539.50]  cheer that he
[4539.50 --> 4540.30]  likes to do
[4540.30 --> 4541.42]  when someone
[4541.42 --> 4542.14]  goes up into a
[4542.14 --> 4542.90]  hard situation
[4542.90 --> 4544.12]  Josh says
[4544.12 --> 4545.70]  the joy of the
[4545.70 --> 4546.14]  Lord is your
[4546.14 --> 4546.64]  strength
[4546.64 --> 4550.22]  he's quoting
[4550.22 --> 4550.74]  scripture
[4550.74 --> 4552.62]  he's encouraging
[4552.62 --> 4553.00]  you with
[4553.00 --> 4553.38]  scripture
[4553.38 --> 4554.54]  but then I
[4554.54 --> 4555.02]  went up to
[4555.02 --> 4556.40]  bat and
[4556.40 --> 4557.36]  Josh shouted
[4557.36 --> 4558.52]  I don't have
[4558.52 --> 4558.94]  to quote the
[4558.94 --> 4559.48]  Bible to you
[4559.48 --> 4559.92]  because you
[4559.92 --> 4560.46]  know it
[4560.46 --> 4563.52]  and he's not
[4563.52 --> 4564.98]  wrong he
[4564.98 --> 4565.54]  doesn't have to
[4565.54 --> 4565.98]  quote it to me
[4565.98 --> 4566.88]  because in that
[4566.88 --> 4567.58]  moment literally
[4567.58 --> 4568.42]  like in my brain
[4568.42 --> 4569.40]  was a rolodex of
[4569.40 --> 4569.96]  scripture verses
[4569.96 --> 4570.36]  that was like
[4570.36 --> 4570.78]  encouragement
[4570.78 --> 4571.24]  encouragement
[4571.24 --> 4571.72]  encouragement
[4571.72 --> 4572.34]  hope good
[4572.34 --> 4573.22]  cheer be
[4573.22 --> 4574.20]  excited run
[4574.20 --> 4575.10]  the race with
[4575.10 --> 4575.42]  the Lord
[4575.42 --> 4576.24]  so round second
[4576.24 --> 4576.78]  base really
[4576.78 --> 4577.46]  fast that's how
[4577.46 --> 4577.92]  I made that
[4577.92 --> 4578.40]  mean in that
[4578.40 --> 4580.14]  moment point
[4580.14 --> 4581.36]  was because my
[4581.36 --> 4582.44]  life is saturated
[4582.44 --> 4583.00]  with the
[4583.00 --> 4584.00]  scriptures and
[4584.00 --> 4584.76]  Josh could say
[4584.76 --> 4585.16]  that and
[4585.16 --> 4585.70]  know that
[4585.70 --> 4586.76]  I was
[4586.76 --> 4587.32]  encouraged
[4587.32 --> 4588.20]  and had
[4588.20 --> 4588.62]  hope
[4588.62 --> 4591.90]  and so
[4591.90 --> 4592.58]  saturate
[4592.58 --> 4593.18]  yourselves
[4593.18 --> 4594.20]  with the
[4594.20 --> 4594.56]  scriptures
[4594.56 --> 4596.06]  and let
[4596.06 --> 4596.80]  that be
[4596.80 --> 4597.86]  a mark
[4597.86 --> 4598.64]  of your
[4598.64 --> 4599.60]  growing
[4599.60 --> 4600.50]  maturity
[4600.50 --> 4602.56]  now the
[4602.56 --> 4603.10]  last thing
[4603.10 --> 4604.54]  about unity
[4604.54 --> 4605.98]  is that it
[4605.98 --> 4606.82]  glorifies
[4606.82 --> 4607.50]  God
[4607.50 --> 4608.82]  gospel unity
[4608.82 --> 4609.72]  glorifies
[4609.72 --> 4610.44]  God
[4610.44 --> 4611.16]  verses 5
[4611.16 --> 4612.64]  and 6
[4612.64 --> 4613.76]  may the
[4613.76 --> 4614.16]  God who
[4614.16 --> 4614.44]  gives
[4614.44 --> 4614.98]  endurance
[4614.98 --> 4615.68]  and encouragement
[4615.68 --> 4616.34]  give you the
[4616.34 --> 4617.04]  same attitude
[4617.04 --> 4617.60]  of mind
[4617.60 --> 4618.34]  toward each
[4618.34 --> 4618.72]  other that
[4618.72 --> 4619.42]  Christ Jesus
[4619.42 --> 4620.60]  had so
[4620.60 --> 4621.48]  that with
[4621.48 --> 4622.34]  one mind
[4622.34 --> 4622.94]  and one
[4622.94 --> 4623.48]  voice
[4623.48 --> 4624.40]  you may
[4624.40 --> 4625.64]  glorify
[4625.64 --> 4626.36]  the God
[4626.36 --> 4627.14]  and Father
[4627.14 --> 4627.68]  of our
[4627.68 --> 4628.06]  Lord
[4628.06 --> 4628.60]  Jesus
[4628.60 --> 4629.72]  Christ
[4629.72 --> 4631.56]  now that
[4631.56 --> 4632.12]  attitude of
[4632.12 --> 4632.68]  mind that
[4632.68 --> 4633.26]  we share
[4633.26 --> 4633.66]  with
[4633.66 --> 4634.90]  Jesus Christ
[4634.90 --> 4635.50]  is one
[4635.50 --> 4636.26]  that willingly
[4636.26 --> 4636.86]  suffers
[4636.86 --> 4638.00]  for a
[4638.00 --> 4638.46]  brother or
[4638.46 --> 4639.42]  sister or
[4639.42 --> 4639.80]  a neighbor
[4639.80 --> 4640.72]  one that
[4640.72 --> 4641.64]  enters into
[4641.64 --> 4642.64]  the struggle
[4642.64 --> 4643.22]  of our
[4643.22 --> 4644.06]  neighbors for
[4644.06 --> 4644.80]  their good
[4644.80 --> 4645.70]  that's what
[4645.70 --> 4646.28]  our unity
[4646.28 --> 4646.76]  is
[4646.76 --> 4647.70]  it's not
[4647.70 --> 4648.34]  requiring
[4648.34 --> 4649.44]  agreement on
[4649.44 --> 4650.16]  disputable
[4650.16 --> 4650.74]  matters
[4650.74 --> 4651.54]  it's agreeing
[4651.54 --> 4652.14]  on how
[4652.14 --> 4652.48]  we're going
[4652.48 --> 4652.90]  to dispute
[4652.90 --> 4653.54]  these matters
[4653.54 --> 4656.72]  our unity
[4656.72 --> 4657.50]  is made
[4657.50 --> 4658.28]  visible in
[4658.28 --> 4658.62]  how we
[4658.62 --> 4659.60]  experience
[4659.60 --> 4660.54]  disagreement
[4660.54 --> 4662.66]  and anyone
[4662.66 --> 4663.56]  who uses
[4663.56 --> 4664.38]  this text
[4664.38 --> 4665.12]  as a hammer
[4665.12 --> 4665.90]  to make
[4665.90 --> 4666.62]  people think
[4666.62 --> 4667.24]  like them
[4667.24 --> 4668.04]  is abusing
[4668.04 --> 4668.88]  this text
[4668.88 --> 4671.90]  and this
[4671.90 --> 4672.38]  is the kind
[4672.38 --> 4672.94]  of unity
[4672.94 --> 4673.92]  that brings
[4673.92 --> 4674.50]  glory to
[4674.50 --> 4674.84]  God
[4674.84 --> 4675.96]  and I
[4675.96 --> 4676.46]  believe that
[4676.46 --> 4676.94]  this is the
[4676.94 --> 4677.62]  kind of unity
[4677.62 --> 4678.28]  that Jesus
[4678.28 --> 4678.98]  prays for
[4678.98 --> 4679.86]  in John 17
[4679.86 --> 4681.62]  right this
[4681.62 --> 4682.04]  is the kind
[4682.04 --> 4682.46]  of unity
[4682.46 --> 4682.96]  that gives
[4682.96 --> 4683.76]  witness to
[4683.76 --> 4684.46]  who God
[4684.46 --> 4685.60]  is and
[4685.60 --> 4686.10]  that's how
[4686.10 --> 4686.52]  it brings
[4686.52 --> 4687.10]  glory to
[4687.10 --> 4687.36]  God
[4687.36 --> 4687.88]  right Jesus
[4687.88 --> 4688.86]  in John 17
[4688.86 --> 4689.96]  prayed that
[4689.96 --> 4690.46]  the church
[4690.46 --> 4691.26]  would be one
[4691.26 --> 4692.40]  as the
[4692.40 --> 4693.52]  father and
[4693.52 --> 4694.86]  he are
[4694.86 --> 4695.66]  one
[4695.66 --> 4697.44]  here's a
[4697.44 --> 4697.66]  little bit
[4697.66 --> 4698.00]  of cool
[4698.00 --> 4698.56]  trinitarian
[4698.56 --> 4699.54]  theology for
[4699.54 --> 4699.96]  you right
[4699.96 --> 4700.88]  because in
[4700.88 --> 4701.30]  trinitarian
[4701.30 --> 4702.10]  theology we
[4702.10 --> 4702.68]  say yes
[4702.68 --> 4703.50]  the father
[4703.50 --> 4703.88]  and the
[4703.88 --> 4704.38]  son are
[4704.38 --> 4704.92]  and the
[4704.92 --> 4705.44]  holy spirit
[4705.44 --> 4706.00]  are one
[4706.00 --> 4706.46]  God
[4706.46 --> 4707.56]  but the
[4707.56 --> 4708.20]  father is
[4708.20 --> 4708.56]  not the
[4708.56 --> 4709.80]  son and
[4709.80 --> 4710.20]  the son
[4710.20 --> 4710.56]  is not
[4710.56 --> 4711.08]  the father
[4711.08 --> 4711.90]  and neither
[4711.90 --> 4712.44]  the son
[4712.44 --> 4712.82]  nor the
[4712.82 --> 4713.24]  father are
[4713.24 --> 4713.54]  the holy
[4713.54 --> 4713.94]  spirit
[4713.94 --> 4714.86]  and around
[4714.86 --> 4715.56]  this triangle
[4715.56 --> 4716.18]  it goes
[4716.18 --> 4719.56]  that they
[4719.56 --> 4721.22]  are one
[4721.22 --> 4722.10]  does not
[4722.10 --> 4723.16]  erase the
[4723.16 --> 4723.66]  differentiation
[4723.66 --> 4725.08]  of persons
[4725.08 --> 4726.08]  within
[4726.08 --> 4727.14]  their
[4727.14 --> 4728.04]  oneness
[4728.04 --> 4728.60]  it doesn't
[4728.60 --> 4729.14]  erase the
[4729.14 --> 4729.74]  distinction
[4729.74 --> 4730.54]  of father
[4730.54 --> 4731.28]  son and
[4731.28 --> 4732.02]  holy spirit
[4732.02 --> 4733.08]  within their
[4733.08 --> 4733.92]  oneness
[4733.92 --> 4735.16]  likewise then
[4735.16 --> 4736.92]  our unity
[4736.92 --> 4738.12]  transcends
[4738.12 --> 4739.48]  our disunity
[4739.48 --> 4740.82]  our distinctives
[4740.82 --> 4742.80]  and it
[4742.80 --> 4743.48]  includes them
[4743.48 --> 4744.96]  and I think
[4744.96 --> 4745.52]  that makes
[4745.52 --> 4746.46]  it all the
[4746.46 --> 4746.82]  more
[4746.82 --> 4747.84]  beautiful
[4747.84 --> 4749.64]  and that's
[4749.64 --> 4750.00]  the kind
[4750.00 --> 4750.54]  of unity
[4750.54 --> 4751.08]  that God
[4751.08 --> 4752.26]  is glorified
[4752.26 --> 4752.62]  by
[4752.62 --> 4755.64]  but then
[4755.64 --> 4756.22]  there's also
[4756.22 --> 4757.46]  a more
[4757.46 --> 4757.94]  imminent
[4757.94 --> 4758.68]  sense
[4758.68 --> 4759.36]  in which
[4759.36 --> 4759.86]  God is
[4759.86 --> 4760.56]  glorified
[4760.56 --> 4761.00]  by that
[4761.00 --> 4761.72]  kind of
[4761.72 --> 4762.04]  unity
[4762.04 --> 4763.22]  in the
[4763.22 --> 4763.52]  sense
[4763.52 --> 4764.02]  that this
[4764.02 --> 4764.38]  sort
[4764.38 --> 4765.02]  of unity
[4765.02 --> 4765.76]  is a
[4765.76 --> 4766.20]  form
[4766.20 --> 4766.64]  of
[4766.64 --> 4767.22]  praising
[4767.22 --> 4768.18]  God
[4768.18 --> 4768.72]  right
[4768.72 --> 4769.46]  or the
[4769.46 --> 4769.84]  purpose
[4769.84 --> 4770.46]  of this
[4770.46 --> 4770.84]  unity
[4770.84 --> 4771.44]  is to
[4771.44 --> 4771.84]  lead
[4771.84 --> 4772.30]  more
[4772.30 --> 4772.80]  and more
[4772.80 --> 4773.28]  people
[4773.28 --> 4774.64]  to praise
[4774.64 --> 4775.12]  him
[4775.12 --> 4775.82]  with one
[4775.82 --> 4776.30]  voice
[4776.30 --> 4777.26]  as Paul
[4777.26 --> 4777.52]  said
[4777.52 --> 4778.30]  to praise
[4778.30 --> 4778.84]  him for
[4778.84 --> 4779.56]  who he
[4779.56 --> 4779.92]  is
[4779.92 --> 4781.30]  verse
[4781.30 --> 4781.62]  seven
[4781.62 --> 4782.26]  right
[4782.26 --> 4782.56]  it says
[4782.56 --> 4782.96]  accept
[4782.96 --> 4783.48]  one another
[4783.48 --> 4784.02]  then just
[4784.02 --> 4784.54]  as Christ
[4784.54 --> 4785.08]  accepted
[4785.08 --> 4785.70]  you in
[4785.70 --> 4786.40]  order to
[4786.40 --> 4787.26]  bring praise
[4787.26 --> 4788.42]  to God
[4788.42 --> 4788.72]  and then
[4788.72 --> 4789.28]  verse nine
[4789.28 --> 4790.30]  Christ came
[4790.30 --> 4790.92]  to confirm
[4790.92 --> 4791.46]  the promises
[4791.46 --> 4791.82]  that were
[4791.82 --> 4792.16]  made
[4792.16 --> 4793.32]  and that
[4793.32 --> 4794.26]  the Gentiles
[4794.26 --> 4795.50]  might glorify
[4795.50 --> 4796.02]  God
[4796.02 --> 4796.54]  for his
[4796.54 --> 4796.92]  mercy
[4796.92 --> 4798.00]  and then
[4798.00 --> 4798.34]  there's this
[4798.34 --> 4798.96]  huge list
[4798.96 --> 4799.90]  of scriptures
[4799.90 --> 4800.64]  that indicate
[4800.64 --> 4801.14]  that this
[4801.14 --> 4801.66]  is the
[4801.66 --> 4801.96]  goal
[4801.96 --> 4802.80]  for your
[4802.80 --> 4803.18]  unity
[4803.18 --> 4803.66]  that this
[4803.66 --> 4803.98]  has been
[4803.98 --> 4804.36]  the goal
[4804.36 --> 4805.08]  all along
[4805.08 --> 4805.38]  I will
[4805.38 --> 4805.92]  praise you
[4805.92 --> 4806.36]  among the
[4806.36 --> 4806.84]  Gentiles
[4806.84 --> 4807.16]  I will
[4807.16 --> 4807.56]  sing the
[4807.56 --> 4807.94]  praises
[4807.94 --> 4808.66]  of your
[4808.66 --> 4808.90]  name
[4808.90 --> 4809.40]  rejoice
[4809.40 --> 4809.74]  you
[4809.74 --> 4810.30]  Gentiles
[4810.30 --> 4811.04]  with his
[4811.04 --> 4811.36]  people
[4811.36 --> 4812.16]  praise the
[4812.16 --> 4812.44]  Lord
[4812.44 --> 4812.90]  all you
[4812.90 --> 4813.40]  Gentiles
[4813.40 --> 4813.96]  let all
[4813.96 --> 4814.14]  the
[4814.14 --> 4814.48]  peoples
[4814.48 --> 4815.00]  extol
[4815.00 --> 4815.26]  him
[4815.26 --> 4816.06]  the
[4816.06 --> 4816.26]  root
[4816.26 --> 4816.40]  of
[4816.40 --> 4816.68]  Jesse
[4816.68 --> 4816.94]  will
[4816.94 --> 4817.24]  spring
[4817.24 --> 4817.54]  up
[4817.54 --> 4819.06]  one
[4819.06 --> 4819.24]  who
[4819.24 --> 4819.40]  will
[4819.40 --> 4819.86]  arise
[4819.86 --> 4820.38]  to rule
[4820.38 --> 4820.80]  over the
[4820.80 --> 4821.20]  nations
[4821.20 --> 4821.82]  in him
[4821.82 --> 4822.08]  the
[4822.08 --> 4822.82]  Gentiles
[4822.82 --> 4823.96]  will hope
[4823.96 --> 4825.20]  a gospel
[4825.20 --> 4825.70]  unity
[4825.70 --> 4826.88]  glorifies God
[4826.88 --> 4827.52]  in the sense
[4827.52 --> 4828.26]  that it brings
[4828.26 --> 4829.42]  him glory
[4829.42 --> 4830.22]  it makes
[4830.22 --> 4831.18]  much of his
[4831.18 --> 4831.72]  greatness
[4831.72 --> 4832.74]  of who he
[4832.74 --> 4833.48]  is and what
[4833.48 --> 4834.18]  he has done
[4834.18 --> 4835.06]  and gospel
[4835.06 --> 4835.56]  unity
[4835.56 --> 4837.40]  also glorifies
[4837.40 --> 4837.80]  God
[4837.80 --> 4838.32]  in his
[4838.32 --> 4839.10]  in the sense
[4839.10 --> 4839.80]  that his
[4839.80 --> 4840.66]  people are
[4840.66 --> 4841.30]  united
[4841.30 --> 4842.02]  together
[4842.02 --> 4842.86]  in their
[4842.86 --> 4843.48]  praising
[4843.48 --> 4844.58]  of him
[4844.58 --> 4846.12]  maturity
[4846.12 --> 4847.24]  in the gospel
[4847.24 --> 4848.18]  builds unity
[4848.18 --> 4849.34]  around the
[4849.34 --> 4849.70]  gospel
[4849.70 --> 4850.18]  and so
[4850.18 --> 4851.20]  all people
[4851.20 --> 4852.04]  everywhere
[4852.04 --> 4853.00]  praise
[4853.00 --> 4854.02]  the Lord
[4854.02 --> 4860.48]  may the
[4860.48 --> 4860.82]  God of

[4865.38 --> 4866.06]  in him
[4866.06 --> 4866.74]  so that
[4866.74 --> 4867.02]  you may
[4867.02 --> 4867.62]  overflow
[4867.62 --> 4868.50]  with hope
[4868.50 --> 4869.10]  by the

[4869.56 --> 4870.44]  of the

[4871.10 --> 4872.66]  you see
[4872.66 --> 4873.16]  maturity
[4873.16 --> 4873.84]  in the
[4873.84 --> 4874.24]  gospel
[4874.24 --> 4874.72]  builds
[4874.72 --> 4875.10]  unity
[4875.10 --> 4875.68]  around
[4875.68 --> 4875.90]  the
[4875.90 --> 4876.28]  gospel
[4876.28 --> 4876.94]  or
[4876.94 --> 4877.32]  to put
[4877.32 --> 4877.44]  it
[4877.44 --> 4877.74]  another

[4878.08 --> 4879.00]  maturity
[4879.00 --> 4880.00]  brings

[4985.76 --> 4986.52]  power
[4986.52 --> 4987.20]  would be
[4987.20 --> 4987.98]  made known
[4987.98 --> 4988.70]  to the
[4988.70 --> 4989.02]  world
[4989.02 --> 4991.16]  in
[4991.16 --> 4991.56]  Jesus
[4991.56 --> 4992.08]  name
[4992.08 --> 4992.34]  we
[4992.34 --> 4992.74]  pray
[4992.74 --> 4994.06]  amen
[4996.82 --> 4998.52]  seen
[4998.58 --> 5009.22]  our
[5009.22 --> 5010.52]  Lord
[5010.52 --> 5011.22]  peace
[5011.22 --> 5011.32]  even
[5011.32 --> 5011.78]  him
[5011.78 --> 5012.20]  to the
[5012.20 --> 5012.48]  end
[5012.48 --> 5012.58]  the
[5012.58 --> 5013.30]  this
[5013.30 --> 5014.30]  is
[5014.30 --> 5014.42]  the

[5016.16 --> 5016.90]  he
[5016.90 --> 5018.64] 背
[5018.64 --> 5019.82]  hills
[5019.82 --> 5020.38]  we
[5020.38 --> 5020.78]  heard
[5020.88 --> 5021.16]  less than
[5021.16 --> 5022.28]  he
[5022.28 --> 5034.16]  How great the chasm that lay between us, how high the mountain I could not climb.
[5034.16 --> 5046.96]  In desperation I turned to heaven and spoke your name into the night.
[5046.96 --> 5059.34]  Then through the darkness your loving kindness tore through the shadows of my soul.
[5059.34 --> 5071.70]  The work is finished, the end is written, Jesus Christ my living hope.
[5071.70 --> 5080.78]  Who could imagine so great a mercy?
[5080.78 --> 5087.26]  What heart could follow such boundless grace?
[5087.90 --> 5099.50]  The God of ages stepped down for glory to wear my sin and bear my shame.
[5099.50 --> 5105.90]  The cross has spoken, I am forgiven.
[5106.94 --> 5112.58]  The King of kings calls me his own.
[5113.12 --> 5118.84]  Beautiful Savior, I'm yours forever.
[5120.28 --> 5125.50]  Jesus Christ my living hope.
[5125.50 --> 5132.74]  Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free.
[5135.24 --> 5139.22]  Hallelujah, death has lost his grip on me.
[5139.58 --> 5142.52]  You have broken every chain.
[5142.88 --> 5145.66]  There's salvation in your name.
[5145.66 --> 5151.40]  Jesus Christ my living hope.
[5151.40 --> 5157.14]  Jesus Christ my living hope.
[5157.14 --> 5159.14]  Jesus Christ my living hope.
[5159.14 --> 5169.98]  When came the morning that sealed the promise, your buried body began to breathe.
[5169.98 --> 5182.72]  Out of the silence, the roaring lion declared the grave had no claim on me.
[5182.72 --> 5195.46]  Then came the morning that sealed the promise, your buried body began to breathe.
[5195.46 --> 5208.52]  Out of the silence, the roaring lion declared the grave has no claim on me.
[5208.52 --> 5209.52]  Jesus Christ my living hope.
[5209.52 --> 5211.52]  Jesus Christ my living hope.
[5211.52 --> 5213.52]  Jesus Christ my living hope.
[5213.52 --> 5222.66]  Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free
[5222.66 --> 5229.22]  Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
[5229.22 --> 5232.56]  You have broken every chain
[5232.56 --> 5235.76]  There's salvation in your name
[5235.76 --> 5241.82]  Jesus Christ, my living heart
[5241.82 --> 5248.84]  Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free
[5248.84 --> 5255.32]  Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
[5255.32 --> 5258.82]  You have broken every chain
[5258.82 --> 5261.78]  There's salvation in your name
[5261.78 --> 5267.90]  Jesus Christ, my living hope
[5267.90 --> 5273.92]  Jesus Christ, my living hope
[5273.92 --> 5280.92]  Oh God, you are my living hope
[5280.92 --> 5305.68]  As we go, we go unified in the power of God, in the gospel of Jesus Christ, and we go with his blessing.
[5305.68 --> 5310.26]  And so receive the blessing of our God for the journey of faith ahead.
[5310.26 --> 5315.24]  God, go before you to lead you
[5315.24 --> 5318.28]  God, go behind you to protect you
[5318.28 --> 5320.88]  God, go beneath you to support you
[5320.88 --> 5323.46]  God, go beside you to befriend you
[5323.46 --> 5325.86]  Do not be afraid
[5325.86 --> 5328.42]  Let the blessing of God come upon you today
[5328.42 --> 5329.88]  Do not be afraid
[5329.88 --> 5332.94]  But go in peace and unity
[5332.94 --> 5335.72]  To love and serve the Lord
[5335.72 --> 5337.36]  Amen
