[2399.64 → 2429.64] Thank you.
[2429.64 → 2459.62] And then, you know,
[2459.64 → 2489.62] And so, you know, you're going to be here.
[2489.62 → 2519.60] And then, you know, you're going to be here.
[2519.60 → 2549.58] And then, you're going to be here.
[2549.58 → 2579.58] And then, you're going to be here.
[2579.58 → 2609.56] You're going to be here.
[2609.56 → 2639.54] Peter, you're going to be here.
[2639.54 → 2669.54] And then, you're going to be here.
[2669.54 → 2699.52] And you, you're going to be here.
[2699.52 → 2729.50] And then, you're going to be here.
[2729.50 → 2759.50] And then, you're going to be here.
[2759.50 → 2789.48] And then, you're going to be here.
[2789.48 → 2819.46] And then, you're going to be here.
[2819.48 → 2849.46] And then, you're going to be here.
[2849.46 → 2879.44] And then, you're going to be here.
[2879.46 → 2909.44] And then, you're going to be here.
[2909.44 → 2910.44] And then, you're going to be here.
[2910.44 → 2912.44] And then, you're going to be here.
[2912.44 → 2914.44] And then, you're going to be here.
[2914.44 → 2916.44] And then, you're going to be here.
[2916.44 → 2917.44] And then, you're going to be here.
[2917.44 → 2919.44] And then, you're going to be here.
[2919.44 → 2920.44] And then, you're going to be here.
[2920.44 → 2923.44] And then, you're going to be here.
[2923.44 → 2930.84] receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. And then Luke, who wrote this book, tells us those who
[2930.84 → 2936.18] accepted his message were baptized and about 3,000 were added to their number that day.
[2937.36 → 2943.14] So what we're seeing and hearing and looking at in this story is that by grace, the Holy Spirit
[2943.14 → 2952.30] comes to you and to me and to the individual, but the Holy Spirit then creates the US, the,
[2952.30 → 2960.88] the church, right? The Holy Spirit creates the church. And immediately following the individual
[2960.88 → 2969.32] decision to repent and be baptized, Luke gives a picture of the common life of their number together.
[2970.40 → 2977.54] And that's the point for this morning, that the Holy Spirit is and gives a transforming power
[2977.54 → 2986.46] to ignite a community made by grace, right? The Holy Spirit is and gives a transforming power,
[2986.46 → 2993.66] and that transforming power creates something, starts something, and that something is a community
[2993.66 → 2999.80] that's shaped by the grace of God. We can actually already start taking that a step further,
[2999.80 → 3007.32] right? By the Word of God preached and proclaimed and read and studied, the Holy Spirit transforms
[3007.32 → 3014.08] lives, right? And then that in turn, in the transformation of individual lives, that in turn
[3014.08 → 3019.42] transforms homes and communities and cities and through it all, the world.
[3019.42 → 3027.66] But what we'll begin to see, I hope, is that this transformation can sometimes look a little bit
[3027.66 → 3038.00] counterintuitive. It can sometimes even be an inversion of your expectations. And at minimum, what it is,
[3038.00 → 3048.52] is unexpected. And from that second part of the passage, the last six verses, we can see
[3048.52 → 3056.10] five characteristics of a church as church. These are going to help us answer the question,
[3056.26 → 3062.96] why is church better than brunch? Or what does it mean to be and to go to church? I'm going to call
[3062.96 → 3071.14] these the five Bs, or how to be a church together. So how you be a church together, you've got Bible
[3071.14 → 3077.98] together, being together, bread together, bowing together, and burgeoning together. Now that's a weird
[3077.98 → 3084.06] word, but I needed a B, I'll explain it when we get there. Let's start with the first one, Bible
[3084.06 → 3092.56] together. One of the defining characteristics of the church, according to Acts 2, is being together
[3092.56 → 3100.96] in the Bible, reading the Bible together, studying the Bible together, listening to the teaching of the
[3100.96 → 3108.02] apostles to biblical teaching and to the exposition of the Bible. Right? We read that they devoted
[3108.02 → 3117.56] themselves to the apostles' teaching. A church that is not centred around the preaching, teaching,
[3117.56 → 3126.86] and living of the Word of God is simply not a church. Now for ears to hear, that might sound like a
[3126.86 → 3133.04] controversial statement. And if it doesn't sound like a controversial statement, one, you're taking
[3133.04 → 3138.74] for granted where you're sitting, or two, you didn't actually hear what I said. Because a church
[3138.74 → 3145.38] that is not centred and built upon the Word of God is not actually a church. It's a social club.
[3147.22 → 3151.80] It's maybe a fun place to go, although if that's why you're going, you're wondering, yeah, you know what,
[3151.84 → 3156.66] brunch probably is better. I mean, what's better than hollandaise over top of lightly poached eggs?
[3156.86 → 3169.66] This. This. This. Every day they met together in the temple courts. They went to study and to learn
[3169.66 → 3177.82] and to hear. A church is a church when we study and learn and hear the Word of God. A church is and
[3177.82 → 3185.08] does so much more than that, absolutely, and amen, but without the first priority of God's Word,
[3185.08 → 3193.76] we cease to be a church. Now, a church doesn't have to do it the way that we do it, right? There's lots
[3193.76 → 3198.44] of culturally conditioned reasons why we do this, lots of history as to why we structure ourselves
[3198.44 → 3204.30] in the way that we do. They don't have to preach the way that I preach, right? And maybe in the right
[3204.30 → 3209.82] setting with the right people, there isn't even a preacher, but everyone sits in a circle and digs into
[3209.82 → 3216.78] the Bible together. The point is, whatever form it takes, the Bible, the teaching of the apostles,
[3217.00 → 3224.80] needs to be held up. The gospel of Jesus, just like Peter's first sermon, needs to be the central
[3224.80 → 3233.72] defining message of the body. And it has to come to us from the Bible read and explained and applied.
[3233.72 → 3241.90] What you can't do, and I've actually heard people say this to me, and I've heard church leaders say
[3241.90 → 3246.44] this, right, is that we don't read the Word, we don't preach the Word, we live the Word.
[3248.34 → 3256.72] And a church preaches and teaches the Bible in community. That's Bible together, right? The Word
[3256.72 → 3263.30] of God, we read, is living and active. So let's let it loose, right? The Word of God is sharper than any
[3263.30 → 3270.52] double-edged sword. It's able to separate bone from marrow. It's a scalpel on the heart, right? God,
[3270.64 → 3277.02] by His Holy Spirit, uses the Word to do heart and soul surgery on His people, right? To take the heart
[3277.02 → 3285.76] of stone that we live with and in and out of and turn it into, transform it into a heart of flesh.
[3287.10 → 3291.90] Right? God's Word, we read, is useful for teaching, correcting, rebuking, and training in righteousness,
[3292.10 → 3298.90] right? God is teaching us a master class on life as He has designed and intended for us to live,
[3298.90 → 3306.30] and He makes that possible in you through His Word, right? He uses His Word to shape you
[3306.30 → 3316.70] like a potter shapes their bowl, to transform you into the image of His Son and to renew your mind.
[3318.30 → 3324.20] Sometimes I hear people say something like, I just wish I could hear God speak to me.
[3325.26 → 3330.42] And then I ask, well, how often are you reading the Word?
[3330.42 → 3338.78] And the answer that I usually get is, well, not really at all, right? Or I try to, but then I just
[3338.78 → 3344.36] fall asleep. Or, you know, I wish I could. I know that I should. I just don't have time.
[3345.72 → 3350.90] And if that's you, if that's your answer, it shouldn't surprise you that you don't hear God speak
[3350.90 → 3356.92] because you're not listening, right? Don't get me wrong, of course. God can speak audibly.
[3356.92 → 3362.04] God can speak through a gentle whisper. God can speak through a revelation. God can speak through
[3362.04 → 3367.84] a dream. He can speak through creation. I believe all of that is true. But the primary way that God
[3367.84 → 3377.50] speaks to us is right here in this Word, is right here at this moment. God is speaking.
[3377.50 → 3386.10] I can illustrate that by saying like this. If I say to you, I want to go watch a movie,
[3387.26 → 3393.78] but then when I go to the theatre, I put a blindfold on and earplugs in, right? I hear
[3393.78 → 3400.26] muffled voices and all the explosions. And maybe depending on how bright things get, I can see
[3400.26 → 3405.24] that there's a change in the amount of light that comes through. I know that something is happening,
[3405.24 → 3409.42] right? That someone is talking, that there are incredible things happening in front of me,
[3409.54 → 3417.12] and it's exciting, but I just don't know what it is. That's kind of like what happens if you're not
[3417.12 → 3422.70] in your Bible and you come to church on Sunday and you walk away going, I just don't actually get
[3422.70 → 3430.80] anything from God. Because you're putting a blindfold on. You're putting earplugs in by not being deeply
[3430.80 → 3439.76] saturated with His Word. God reveals Himself through the pages of the Bible, and He shows you what His
[3439.76 → 3447.84] design and intent for life is. And to be a church, we must believe and practice that.
[3450.64 → 3457.40] Bible together. The second one is being together. They devoted themselves to fellowship.
[3457.40 → 3466.18] Now, I'm fully aware that fellowship is a church word. I have not met somebody under 40
[3466.18 → 3473.82] who doesn't go to church and uses the word fellowship. It just doesn't happen, right? You
[3473.82 → 3479.84] don't hear people at the pub saying, I'm just here for the fellowship. At least I've never heard it.
[3479.98 → 3485.88] Maybe you have different friends than I do. Is a fellowship then a word that we really understand?
[3485.88 → 3490.94] Right? I'll stand up here and invite you to fellowship after the service, or you'll go to
[3490.94 → 3496.48] someone's house for dinner, and maybe even your kids will pray, Jesus, thank you for this fellowship.
[3497.72 → 3503.26] Those are weird kids. I mean, those are our kids, don't get me wrong, but that's not how people normally
[3503.26 → 3511.26] talk. In the biblical image of fellowship, there's so much more than just hanging out or being together.
[3511.26 → 3516.46] Right? For most of us, that's what fellowship might be, hanging out, drinking coffee, sharing a meal,
[3516.60 → 3521.14] but there's so much more. Look at how Acts 2 builds on the idea of fellowship.
[3522.36 → 3528.14] Right? All the believers were together, and they had everything in common. They sold property and
[3528.14 → 3536.60] possessions to give to everyone who has need. Now, if you're of a certain generation, older than me,
[3536.60 → 3543.40] immediately, right, your flags of red commies are going off right now. This isn't 20th century
[3543.40 → 3550.24] communism. Right? Notice that the giving is voluntary. People still maintain their personal
[3550.24 → 3556.24] possessions like homes and property. Right? This isn't communism or even communalism,
[3556.24 → 3560.00] as it's sometimes been defined, but it is community.
[3560.00 → 3569.44] A better analogy might actually be a family. Right? The church is a family. And this is true
[3569.44 → 3577.94] here locally and universally. Right? As brothers and sisters, we take care of each other. We take care
[3577.94 → 3583.78] of our own. But also, again, this idea of fellowship is even bigger than that because it's not just our
[3583.78 → 3592.04] own. Did you notice in verse 47? Right? They were together praising God and enjoying the favour of all
[3592.04 → 3600.72] the people. Enjoying the favour of all the people. Now, surely, all people means all people in that
[3600.72 → 3608.14] moment. Right? So, not just those who are inside the family of the church, but the earliest church in
[3608.14 → 3614.20] Acts enjoyed the favour of all people, at least they did for a period of time, because by the time you get to
[3614.20 → 3619.40] the end of the book of Acts, things have changed a little bit. But they're enjoying the favour of all people
[3619.40 → 3627.08] because they gave themselves for the sake of all people. They loved their neighbours, their neighbours who are
[3627.08 → 3636.38] in and out of church. Last weekend here, when we did the food bank or the food drive for Langley Food Bank, how
[3636.38 → 3644.14] many of our neighbours came and said, thanks so much for doing this. This is such a great idea. We're
[3644.14 → 3652.78] enjoying the favour of all people. In fact, in the fourth century, there was an emperor named Julian.
[3653.50 → 3659.48] History has called him Julian the Apostate, and that's because he rejected the Christianity that was
[3659.48 → 3665.18] burgeoning at the time and tried to bring the empire back to its pagan roots because simultaneous to
[3665.18 → 3671.10] this is the decline of the Roman Empire. And so he thinks if we get back to our roots, we'll be strong again.
[3671.74 → 3685.48] But Julian the Apostate, who reigned from 355 to 363, said to his leaders and the high priests in his temple
[3685.48 → 3694.70] systems, if we want to save paganism, we need to be like the Christians. Helping one another, serving the poor,
[3694.70 → 3703.26] raising the children that we have cast out. The early church worked together for a purpose, and it made
[3703.26 → 3712.86] them appear some certain way in the world around them. And that is the best definition of fellowship
[3712.86 → 3720.52] that we have. The Greek word here in Acts is Livonia, and it's a word that means, in its fullest sense,
[3720.52 → 3728.18] participating together towards a common goal. Not just coffee after church, but participating together
[3728.18 → 3735.88] towards a common goal. Being together, fellowship is around a common goal. And so what's our common goal?
[3736.92 → 3744.02] Do we have one? And again, I don't think it's too strong to say this, but a church without a mission
[3744.02 → 3752.70] is not a church. Or at least it's a floundering church. It's an aimlessly wandering church. So what
[3752.70 → 3757.54] is the goal? What is the mission? What is the target and direction towards which we are working?
[3759.70 → 3767.28] And maybe it's not an oversimplification to say our mission is to gather, grow, and go.
[3767.28 → 3774.10] Right? That's our common goal. Right? We gather here, and we grow together, and then we go out
[3774.10 → 3779.18] on mission to all of those places along the back. We go into those places and those spaces
[3779.18 → 3787.04] to reveal Jesus Christ in His life, death, resurrection, and exaltation. Right? That's our common goal.
[3787.20 → 3791.50] At least, it's our stated common goal. Whether it's actually common is up to you.
[3791.50 → 3801.32] But if there's a shared goal, right? Know this, that moving together towards that goal
[3801.32 → 3809.84] is going to involve two critical things. One, discipleship. That is, we are going to have to
[3809.84 → 3818.04] train up each other and the next generation of Christian leaders. We will have to study and
[3818.04 → 3825.42] commit our lives to studying and being together and shaping people in line with this mission to
[3825.42 → 3833.90] gather, grow, and go. Discipleship is critical to this idea of being together. The second thing
[3833.90 → 3840.40] that is critical to this is discipline. Now, immediately, some of you start bristling
[3840.40 → 3849.44] because there are two ways that word is used, right? And one, we can get behind. One is like an athlete
[3849.44 → 3856.36] who is training for their sport. Right? You are disciplined in the training. One is like a musician
[3856.36 → 3863.06] who is learning her instrument. You are disciplined in that work. You commit to practicing at least 30
[3863.06 → 3874.18] minutes a week, a day. Right? However much you put in is what you'll get out. That requires discipline.
[3875.06 → 3883.86] But also, discipline requires accountability. It requires letting someone speak into your life saying,
[3884.26 → 3890.60] I don't think you're doing this properly or right or well. It requires letting someone speak into your
[3890.60 → 3897.32] life that says, I think you need to cut this out to stop what you are doing so that you might be more
[3897.32 → 3904.84] and more transformed into the image of Jesus Christ. The church throughout time and place, except maybe
[3904.84 → 3912.68] for the last 50 to 100 years, has always had an incredibly high bar of what it means to be
[3912.68 → 3924.36] a disciple of Jesus in every area of our lives together. And that seems to have gotten lower and lower and lower.
[3925.24 → 3935.64] Maybe it's time to pick that up again, to mutually, to communally come together and be disciplined
[3935.64 → 3947.32] in our discipleship to Jesus. Fellowship, being together, is disciples on mission, disciplining ourselves
[3947.32 → 3958.20] to what we could easily call radical obedience. Third, bread together. And just so we're clear, each one of
[3958.20 → 3964.04] these gets progressively shorter. Although I haven't been here for a couple of weeks, so maybe I have more
[3964.04 → 3970.84] to say. Bread together. They devoted themselves to the breaking of bread. They broke bread in their houses
[3970.84 → 3980.04] and ate with glad and sincere hearts. For the church to be the church, we must break bread together.
[3980.04 → 3988.12] And this is more than just a meal together in our homes, although it does include that. Right? And in fact,
[3988.12 → 3995.96] as pastoral elders in the last number of years, we have taken up the practice of starting our meetings
[3995.96 → 4001.56] together with a meal together for at least three of those meetings every year, sometimes four,
[4001.56 → 4008.76] if we're lucky and Kevin volunteers to cook. But we start with a meal together and that has changed
[4008.76 → 4016.20] the tone and the tenor of our room together. That's changed the way we come together and the work
[4016.20 → 4023.48] that we do together and how we do that work. It is a beautiful, beautiful thing. But for us,
[4023.48 → 4030.12] more specifically, it is eating this meal together. It's eating the Lord's meal together, the Lord's
[4030.12 → 4036.92] Supper, the Eucharist, the communion meal. Right? In the early church and in some places, this is a meal
[4036.92 → 4042.36] that would happen in the service. So the churches would gather and they would share a meal together.
[4042.36 → 4049.64] And then at some point, a leader would stand up, and they would transition to this part of the meal.
[4050.92 → 4057.32] They would have the Lord's Supper together. And for the church to be the church, we must be breaking
[4057.32 → 4064.20] bread together. We must be celebrating the sacrament of the Lord's Supper. And as we come to the table
[4064.20 → 4072.44] today, here's what I want you to reflect on as you walk forward. That this table is more than just a
[4072.44 → 4080.44] remembering. We are coming here, and we are remembering, but that act of remembering is used by the Holy
[4080.44 → 4088.76] Spirit, is transformed by the Holy Spirit through His presence among us to turn this moment into an
[4088.76 → 4097.32] encounter with God. Such that as you take that bread and drink that juice, right, it becomes spiritually
[4097.32 → 4109.08] for us the body and blood of Jesus. Here we are literally taking in Jesus' flesh so that we might be
[4109.08 → 4118.04] united to Him in our spirits. This is more than just a remembering. But it's not only that we're united to
[4118.04 → 4122.92] Jesus, that's why when we come to this table, we're going to do it in a circle together around in
[4122.92 → 4130.12] different groups, because we're being united to each other, right? Our union with Jesus is indelibly
[4130.12 → 4137.24] connected to our union with each other. And that's what happens when we come here.
[4137.24 → 4145.96] Right? This Lord's Supper liturgy even that we will speak has elements that date all the way back to
[4145.96 → 4153.32] the first centuries of the church. We are standing on the tradition of those who have gone before us.
[4153.32 → 4162.20] And we are professing the faith of the apostles. And we are being united to Jesus Christ and to each other.
[4162.20 → 4173.96] We break bread together. And then we bow together. Notice here, they devoted themselves to prayer.
[4175.48 → 4183.00] And prayer, I've said before, is the lifeblood of the church, right? For the church to be the church alive
[4183.00 → 4192.84] and active, it must be praying. Right? So part of what I do is pray for all of you. Every week,
[4193.56 → 4198.84] pray for all of you. Part of what the elders do when we gather is to pray for all of you.
[4200.28 → 4206.36] Part of what others in this church do over and over and over again is to pray for us here and to pray
[4206.36 → 4214.44] for the church around the world. Right? Whatever we do has to be fuelled with prayer. And so whether it's
[4214.44 → 4223.24] formally at an event here or privately in your own time of devotion, pray fervently, urgently, and expectantly.
[4224.52 → 4231.08] That's the church. I will never forget in the church I served before coming here,
[4231.08 → 4238.44] there was this little old Dutch woman. Now you can picture what you think that might mean in your head.
[4239.32 → 4250.12] But she, as frail as she looked, was the most fiery spirit I have ever met. And even at 88 years old,
[4250.92 → 4258.76] when she prayed, you could tell that something was happening in her and coming out of her. And it was
[4258.76 → 4266.12] so beautiful. And I've described it before as her words were reformed, but her posture, her demeanour
[4266.12 → 4274.52] was full on Pentecostal. And she would pray for the church and for the movement of the spirit. She
[4274.52 → 4279.64] would pray for the children of the church and for the young families in the church. She would pray for
[4279.64 → 4286.60] the leaders of the church. And it was a beautiful thing to behold. This is how we pray. In the confidence
[4286.60 → 4293.64] of our sovereign God, urging, pleading for him to be at work among us and in the world.
[4294.68 → 4301.40] And not only do we pray together, but we burgeon together. We burgeon together. We read,
[4301.40 → 4305.80] the Lord added to their number daily those who are being saved.
[4308.04 → 4314.92] Growing together, inwardly and outwardly, is burgeoning together. Right? Here's what I believe,
[4314.92 → 4322.36] that if a church is doing Bible together, is being together, is breaking bread together, is bowing
[4322.36 → 4329.56] together, the people of that church will burgeon. That is, they will grow. Burgeon literally means
[4329.56 → 4338.20] to produce new buds or leaves, to swell and develop into leaves and flowers. Right? We want to grow.
[4338.20 → 4346.12] Now that growth may be inward. It may be internal. But my prayer is always that it's also outward
[4346.12 → 4352.68] and in numbers. Right? That new people are gathered into the church that is doing these kinds of things.
[4353.72 → 4360.12] But not only that, that we as a church are also sending people out in global mission.
[4360.12 → 4367.80] Right? It's been a little while in our churches today where we have celebrated those who have been
[4367.80 → 4376.76] called to be a missionary far-flung around the world and in places yet unknown. To languages yet
[4376.76 → 4384.60] translated for a Bible. But that's what we need in the world today. And a church that is being the church
[4384.60 → 4393.00] will see that sort of thing happen among them. Green and Bartholomew, two professors of mine,
[4393.00 → 4398.68] they reflect on this line. They say that the life and power of the Spirit of Christ in the believing
[4398.68 → 4406.84] community radiates the light of the kingdom and draws people in from the darkness. This is what's
[4406.84 → 4413.40] happening in the church. The amazing truth of this story from the early church as it continues into our
[4413.40 → 4422.36] age is that Jesus by the Holy Spirit continues to draw people to himself using feeble, inept, broken people
[4423.00 → 4435.48] like me and even like you. There's a quote that comes to us from
[4435.48 → 4447.96] a writer who is unknown. We don't know their name, but he writes an epistle to Igneous in the second
[4447.96 → 4455.24] century. Now what we know is he's an apologist. Now an apologist isn't someone who says, I'm sorry.
[4455.24 → 4462.60] An apologist is someone who defends the truth of the Bible and of Scripture. And I want to share with you
[4462.60 → 4470.12] this quote because as we live in this time of an increasingly post-Christian world, I think it's
[4470.12 → 4476.44] really valuable for us to look to the pre-Christian world for example and illustration. Now this quote
[4476.44 → 4482.20] is a little bit long, but it's beautiful, and it will be on the screen behind me as I read it. This is
[4482.20 → 4487.00] where we'll begin to land the plane together. So here are these words.
[4487.00 → 4495.80] Christians cannot be distinguished from the rest of the human race by country or language or customs.
[4496.68 → 4502.20] They do not live in cities of their own. They do not use a peculiar form of speech,
[4502.20 → 4509.48] except maybe the word fellowship. They do not follow an eccentric manner of life. This doctrine of theirs has
[4509.48 → 4516.04] not been discovered by the ingenuity or deep thought of inquisitive men, nor do they put forward a merely human
[4516.04 → 4523.56] teaching as some people do. Yet, although they live in Greek and barbarian cities alike, as each man's
[4523.56 → 4529.32] lot has been cast and follow the customs of the country in clothing and food and other matters of
[4529.32 → 4537.00] daily living, at the same time they give proof of the remarkable and admittedly extraordinary constitution
[4537.00 → 4544.76] of their own commonwealth. They live in their own countries, but only as aliens. They have a share in
[4544.76 → 4552.20] everything as citizens and endure everything as foreigners. Every foreign land is their fatherland,
[4552.20 → 4559.16] and yet for them every fatherland is a foreign land. They marry like everyone else and beget children,
[4559.16 → 4565.32] but they do not cast out their offspring. Now that refers to the abhorrent practice that was common in the
[4565.32 → 4571.16] Roman world. If you had a child that you didn't want primarily, and often if it was a girl, they would just go
[4571.16 → 4577.00] outside the city limits and leave them in the garbage heap. That's casting out of children. In fact,
[4577.00 → 4580.84] early Christians would go to those places and collect those babies and raise them as their own.
[4583.16 → 4589.16] They share their board, their table, with each other, but not their marriage bed. It is true that they are
[4589.16 → 4594.76] in the flesh, but they do not live according to the flesh. They busy themselves on earth, but their
[4594.76 → 4603.56] citizenship is in heaven. They obey the established laws, but in their own lives they go far beyond what
[4603.56 → 4612.04] the laws require. They love all men and by all men are persecuted. Furthermore, they are unknown and still they are
[4612.04 → 4618.36] condemned. They are put to death, and yet they are brought to life. Furthermore, they are poor, and yet they make many
[4618.36 → 4623.80] rich. They are completely destitute, and yet they enjoy complete abundance. Furthermore, they are dishonoured and in their
[4623.80 → 4630.36] very dishonoured and glorified. They are defamed and are vindicated. Furthermore, they are reviled and yet they bless.
[4630.36 → 4636.52] When they are affronted, they still pay due respect. When they do good, they are punished as evildoers,
[4636.52 → 4641.16] undergoing punishment. They rejoice as they are brought to life. They are treated by Jews as
[4641.16 → 4646.76] foreigners and enemies and are hunted down by the Greeks. And all the time, those who hate them
[4646.76 → 4652.76] find it impossible to justify their enmity. Remember the words of Julian the Apostate?
[4654.20 → 4662.20] To put it simply, what the soul is in the body, that Christians are in the world.
[4664.92 → 4670.84] When the church is the church, it can be an animating spirit,
[4670.84 → 4681.08] bringing joy and life to the world around us, even as the world may hate what we stand for.
[4682.84 → 4689.80] From the beginning and in a world of sheer opposition, this is how the church has functioned.
[4690.92 → 4698.60] Because the Holy Spirit is and gives a transforming power to ignite a community made by grace, we study
[4698.60 → 4704.76] God's word together, we do life together, we eat together, and we celebrate the Eucharist together,
[4704.76 → 4717.00] we pray together, and we gather, grow, and go together. This is who we are. My prayer is that this will be
[4717.64 → 4724.20] who we are becoming even more and more. Amen? Amen. Let's pray together.
[4728.60 → 4735.32] Lord our God, we have heard from your word, and so now we come to your table.
[4737.00 → 4743.56] We pray that you would take the truth of these words spoken and proclaim out of your word to us,
[4743.56 → 4750.84] and you would allow us to taste and see their truth as we come together to this table.
[4750.84 → 4752.92] Lord our God, we pray that you would love to us.
[4752.92 → 4760.76] Transform our lives by your Holy Spirit, that as we go from this place, we might go as a people renewed,
[4761.24 → 4768.60] as a people refreshed, and as a people encouraged and convicted to be disciples on mission with you.
[4769.24 → 4775.00] Holy Spirit, empower us to that end, to the end of the glory of your name,
[4775.00 → 4783.00] and the revealing of your kingdom come and coming. In Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. Amen.
[4785.64 → 4791.96] As we have said, as we come to this table, there's a liturgy that we will speak, and you will speak
[4791.96 → 4800.60] in response to, and parts of these things have been with the church from the second and third and fourth
[4800.60 → 4808.76] centuries. And so we are standing in a long line of those who remember and who receive the grace of
[4808.76 → 4819.64] our God as we come to this table. And so lift your hearts. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
[4823.08 → 4823.88] Let's pray together.
[4823.88 → 4832.44] Father, with joy we praise you, gracious God. For you have created heaven and earth, you have made us
[4832.44 → 4839.40] in your image, and have kept covenant with us even when we fell into sin. We give you thanks for Jesus
[4839.40 → 4846.84] Christ, who by his life, death, and resurrection opened to us the way of everlasting life. Amen.
[4846.84 → 4857.72] Now our Lord Jesus, before he suffered, gave us this memorial of his sacrifice until he comes again.
[4858.68 → 4865.00] The Lord Jesus, on the night that he was betrayed, took bread. And when he had given thanks, he broke it
[4865.00 → 4874.36] and said, this is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me. And in the same way,
[4874.36 → 4885.56] after supper, he took the cup, saying, this cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this in remembrance of me.
[4885.56 → 4899.64] For whenever we eat this bread and drink this cup, we proclaim the Lord's death until he comes again.
[4900.68 → 4912.52] This is the mystery of our faith. Your death, O Christ, we proclaim. Your resurrection, we affirm with joy.
[4912.52 → 4918.28] You're coming, we await with hope. Glory be to you, Lord Jesus.
[4920.52 → 4928.20] Church family, the Lord has prepared his table for all who love him and trust in him alone for their salvation.
[4929.24 → 4937.18] And so, come to this table, you who have much faith and you who would like to have more.
[4937.18 → 4944.36] Come to this table, you who have been to this sacrament often and you who have not been for a long time.
[4944.64 → 4952.18] Come to this table, you who have tried to follow Jesus and you who have failed, because at this table, you are in good company.
[4953.24 → 4957.18] Come to this table because Jesus is raised.
[4957.18 → 4963.66] Come to this table, if you are here or if you are at home participating in your own way.
[4964.04 → 4967.96] Come because it is Christ who invites us to meet him here.
[4968.06 → 4972.72] It is Christ who carries us, and it is Christ who receives us.
[4974.68 → 4979.12] These are the gifts of God for the people of God.
[4979.12 → 4991.26] As we come to this table, as I have said, we will do so in groups, and we will take a circle, and you will pass the bread to your left or to your right.
[4991.50 → 4996.00] As you pass that, we invite you to say the body of Christ given for you.
[4996.30 → 5000.86] As you pass the juice, you may say the blood of Christ shed for you.
[5000.86 → 5009.88] As we move through, we will do so first with the worship volunteers and the others who are helping us serve.
[5010.68 → 5018.64] And then you will be indicated, your rose will be indicated when it is your turn to come up to the front by the ushers who are there.
[5019.22 → 5024.72] If you are unable to come to the front but would like to receive the elements, please just indicate that to the ushers
[5024.72 → 5028.46] and they will come serve you in your seats where you are at.
[5028.46 → 5034.90] As you receive the bread as well, just a note, the centre cup is gluten-free bread.
[5035.42 → 5038.40] And so if you require that, you may take from there as well.
[5039.54 → 5045.36] If you are a guest with us here this morning as well, the juice that goes around is all juice.
[5045.82 → 5048.42] There is no wine in these glasses here.
[5048.42 → 5055.16] So I invite those volunteers and other leaders who are going to help us serve this morning.
[5058.46 → 5076.02] The body of Christ given for you.
[5077.86 → 5079.22] The body of Christ given for you.
[5079.22 → 5079.24] The body of Christ given for you.
[5079.24 → 5084.56] I'm going to go around here.
[5084.56 → 5085.24] There you go.
[5085.24 → 5087.76] There you go.
[5087.76 → 5088.82] There you go.
[5088.82 → 5118.80] Thank you.
[5118.82 → 5124.16] Eat and remember.
[5135.16 → 5136.82] Blood of Christ shed for you.
[5140.42 → 5142.06] Blood of Christ shed for you.
[5148.82 → 5155.78] Blood of Christ shed for you.
[5155.78 → 5161.98] Blood of Christ shed for you.
[5161.98 → 5164.44] Blood of Christ shed for you.
[5164.44 → 5168.06] Blood eyes Hold.
[5168.06 → 5169.02] What did we say?
[5169.02 → 5170.42] It was our usher.
[5170.42 → 5172.72] Okay.
[5172.72 → 5202.70] Thank you.
[5202.72 → 5232.70] Thank you.
[5232.72 → 5262.70] Thank you.
[5262.72 → 5264.72] Thank you.
[5292.72 → 5294.72] Thank you.
[5322.72 → 5324.72] Thank you.
[5352.72 → 5354.72] Thank you.
[5382.72 → 5384.72] Thank you.
[5412.72 → 5414.72] Thank you.
[5442.72 → 5444.72] Thank you.
[5472.72 → 5474.72] Thank you.
[5502.72 → 5504.72] Thank you.
[5504.72 → 5506.72] Thank you.
[5506.72 → 5508.72] Thank you.
[5508.72 → 5510.72] Thank you.
[5510.72 → 5512.72] Thank you.
[5512.72 → 5514.72] Thank you.
[5514.72 → 5516.72] Thank you.
[5516.72 → 5518.72] Thank you.
[5518.72 → 5520.72] Thank you.
[5520.72 → 5522.72] Thank you.
[5522.72 → 5526.72] Thank you.
[5526.72 → 5528.72] Thank you.
[5528.72 → 5536.04] Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[5537.64 → 5544.70] Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[5558.72 → 5588.70] Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[5588.72 → 5602.72] So dearly that I, the guilty one, make a free.
[5603.96 → 5614.72] A busy life of unsacrificed, the Son of God before me.
[5614.72 → 5621.04] My death he pays and my death he dies.
[5621.52 → 5626.72] That I might live.
[5627.14 → 5632.72] That I might live.
[5632.72 → 5641.04] And so they watched and died.
[5641.04 → 5647.04] I despise the sweet charitable.
[5647.84 → 5653.04] But all the money share.
[5654.16 → 5658.04] Come, Lord Jesus.
[5658.04 → 5664.04] I'll praise the love of unsacrificed.
[5664.04 → 5670.04] And so they watched and died.
[5670.04 → 5676.04] My death he pays and my death he dies.
[5676.84 → 5681.04] That I might live.
[5682.34 → 5687.04] That I might live.
[5687.04 → 5689.04] And so they watched and died.
[5689.04 → 5693.04] And so they watched and died.
[5693.04 → 5695.04] And so they watched and died.
[5695.04 → 5699.04] And so they watched and died.
[5699.04 → 5701.04] And so they watched and died.
[5701.04 → 5703.04] And so they watched and died.
[5703.04 → 5705.04] And so they watched and died.
[5705.04 → 5705.90] That I passed and died.
[5713.94 → 5716.28] So and boats and died.
[5716.28 → 5718.86] Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[5718.86 → 5722.40] Look, amen.
[5722.40 → 5741.40] I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man.
[5752.40 → 5782.38] Thank you.
[5782.40 → 5812.38] Thank you.
[5812.40 → 5814.40] Thank you.
