[0.00 --> 5.10]  Cause I hear a voice and he calls me redeemed
[5.10 --> 8.20]  Will never say I'll never be alone
[8.20 --> 13.44]  And greater is the one living inside of me
[13.44 --> 16.62]  Than he who is living in the world
[16.62 --> 19.50]  In the world
[19.50 --> 23.00]  In the world
[23.00 --> 29.28]  In the world

[39.02 --> 41.00]  In the world
[41.00 --> 43.00]  And greater is the one living inside of me
[43.00 --> 46.00]  Than he who is living in the world
[46.00 --> 47.54]  Come on, hey, hey
[47.54 --> 48.00]  There are things I lose
[48.00 --> 50.00]  The battle of grace says that it doesn't matter
[50.00 --> 52.00]  Cause I've already won the world
[52.00 --> 64.00]  is
[72.88 --> 78.40]  oh i've heard a thousand stories of what

[230.40 --> 232.40]  i
[232.40 --> 236.40]  i can hardly think as you call me
[236.40 --> 248.40]  deeper still as you call me
[248.40 --> 250.40]  deeper still as you call me
[250.40 --> 252.40]  deeper still into love

[258.40 --> 260.40]  it's who you are
[260.40 --> 262.40]  it's who you are
[262.40 --> 264.40]  it's who you are
[264.40 --> 294.38]  It's who I am.
[294.40 --> 299.98]  Good morning, everyone. Obviously, the sound system is working well.
[301.30 --> 304.12]  I'm here to welcome you to Emmanuel Church this morning.
[305.26 --> 308.86]  Both of our regular pastors are away or not available today,
[309.00 --> 315.18]  so we will be having Pastor Jonathan Wang from Hope Community Church with us this morning.
[315.32 --> 319.56]  He'll be leading us in God's Word. He'll be giving us a greeting in a few minutes.
[319.56 --> 325.74]  I'd like to give the mic over to Mike to tell us about the food drive.
[326.94 --> 332.56]  Yeah, I just did an announcement about the upcoming Murrayville food drive that our church is hosting.
[333.10 --> 339.60]  It's coming up this coming Saturday where we'll have the food drive and the big community festival here like we've done for many years.
[339.60 --> 344.16]  But today is our sort of day we're hoping to canvas the neighborhood.
[344.48 --> 347.62]  So there's been a few emails and different communications about this,
[347.72 --> 352.58]  but today is the day we're hoping to start visiting people with handfuls of bags,
[352.68 --> 358.96]  with little flyers and some information for people so that they have the week ahead of them to fill that bag with groceries or diapers or whatever
[358.96 --> 361.46]  and bring it and join us for the festival on Saturday.
[361.46 --> 368.76]  So after the service, Brenda and I will be at some tables and we've kind of organized things into piles
[368.76 --> 372.72]  and we've got kind of lower Murrayville all separated into seven different areas
[372.72 --> 378.82]  and we're hoping we can have some teams of people go out and, yeah, knock on doors or deliver the bags and whatever else.
[379.04 --> 380.34]  They're kind of organized by district.
[380.70 --> 383.88]  We won't be too niggly about that.
[383.96 --> 386.58]  We'll just make it work with whoever is available to help us out
[386.58 --> 391.10]  and, yeah, hopefully we can just spread a little bit of love in this community and bless the food bank.
[391.46 --> 391.70]  So.
[394.72 --> 395.24]  Oh, yeah.
[395.60 --> 396.10]  Thanks, Brenda.
[396.40 --> 399.36]  We also have a healthy stack of extra bags.
[399.70 --> 403.24]  So if you feel like you want to hit your local neighborhood
[403.24 --> 405.84]  or you want to take some home for you and your friends and family,
[406.04 --> 407.84]  we've got several hundred extra bags.
[408.06 --> 409.14]  So don't be shy.
[411.54 --> 414.26]  I'd like to welcome Jonathan up for the Lord's greeting.
[421.46 --> 424.80]  Good morning.
[426.72 --> 429.62]  It is a privilege to join you in worship this morning.
[430.36 --> 434.66]  And this is the Lord's greeting from Psalm 150.
[434.66 --> 437.34]  Praise the Lord.
[437.92 --> 439.44]  Praise God in his sanctuary.
[440.12 --> 441.70]  Praise him in his mighty heavens.
[442.52 --> 444.38]  Praise him for his acts of power.
[444.92 --> 446.80]  Praise him for his surpassing greatness.
[447.78 --> 449.34]  Praise him with the sounding of the trumpet.
[450.20 --> 451.74]  Praise him with the harp and lyre.
[452.62 --> 454.28]  Praise him with the timbrel and dancing.
[455.14 --> 456.68]  Praise him with the strings and pipe.
[457.42 --> 459.34]  Praise him with the clash of cymbals even.
[460.06 --> 462.08]  Praise him with resounding cymbals.
[462.08 --> 464.88]  Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.
[465.54 --> 466.30]  Praise the Lord.
[467.16 --> 469.80]  At this time, I invite you to greet those around you
[469.80 --> 471.10]  and share the peace of Christ.
[492.08 --> 506.88]  Good morning, brothers and sisters in Christ.
[507.60 --> 511.92]  Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 98, 4 to 9.
[513.84 --> 515.80]  Shout to the Lord, all the earth.
[516.60 --> 519.14]  Break out in praise and sing for joy.
[519.14 --> 522.06]  Sing your praise to the Lord with the harp,
[522.52 --> 524.48]  with the harp and melodious song,
[525.10 --> 527.90]  with trumpets and the sound of the ram's horn.
[528.76 --> 531.32]  Make a joyful symphony before the Lord, the King.
[532.10 --> 534.94]  Let the sea and everything in it shout his praise.
[535.68 --> 538.00]  Let the earth and all living things join in.
[538.58 --> 540.46]  Let the rivers clap their hands in glee.
[540.94 --> 544.16]  Let the hills sing out their songs of joy before the Lord,
[544.42 --> 546.34]  for he is coming to judge the earth.
[546.34 --> 550.34]  He will judge the world with justice and the nations with fairness.

[1008.90 --> 1026.90]  have nothing to do with these fruitless deeds of darkness but rather turn your eyes upon jesus
[1026.90 --> 1040.90]  exposing your heart to his light
[1040.90 --> 1046.90]  look full in his wonderful face
[1046.90 --> 1054.90]  and the things of earth will grow strangely dim
[1054.90 --> 1060.90]  in the light of his glory and grace
[1060.90 --> 1072.90]  in the face of your own sin or the sin of a brother in christ look to jesus not just to prove sin and wrongdoing
[1073.78 --> 1082.90]  but to see clearly the founder and perfecter of our faith who for the joy set before him endured the cross in our place
[1082.90 --> 1084.90]  the kingdom of our faith
[1084.90 --> 1086.90]  and the kingdom of our faith

[1559.30 --> 1562.96]  What living out of the fruit of the Spirit looks like in a tangible way
[1562.96 --> 1566.58]  They are joys to the heart captured by the love of Jesus
[1566.58 --> 1570.10]  How to live rightly in relationship with God and his people
[1570.10 --> 1574.94]  Join together as we recite the Ten Commandments from Exodus 20
[1574.94 --> 1579.68]  Reminding ourselves that loving God and loving our neighbor is the heart of these commandments
[1579.68 --> 1582.54]  And God spoke these words
[1582.54 --> 1585.20]  I am the Lord your God
[1585.20 --> 1586.78]  Who brought you out of Egypt
[1586.78 --> 1589.14]  Out of the land of slavery
[1589.14 --> 1592.28]  You shall have no other gods before me
[1592.28 --> 1594.82]  You shall not make for yourself
[1594.82 --> 1598.22]  An image in the form of anything in heaven above
[1598.22 --> 1599.94]  Or on the earth beneath
[1599.94 --> 1601.52]  Or in the waters below
[1601.52 --> 1604.18]  You shall not bow down to them
[1604.18 --> 1605.40]  Or worship them
[1605.40 --> 1607.74]  For I, the Lord your God
[1607.74 --> 1609.02]  Am a jealous God
[1609.02 --> 1612.40]  Punishing the children for the sins of the parents
[1612.40 --> 1616.20]  To the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me
[1616.20 --> 1622.12]  But showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments
[1622.12 --> 1626.50]  You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God
[1626.50 --> 1630.92]  For the Lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name
[1630.92 --> 1634.38]  Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy
[1634.38 --> 1638.22]  Six days you shall labor and do all your work
[1638.22 --> 1641.78]  But the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God
[1641.78 --> 1644.60]  On it you shall not do any work
[1644.60 --> 1647.36]  Neither you, nor your son or daughter
[1647.36 --> 1649.86]  Nor your male or female servant
[1649.86 --> 1651.34]  Nor your animals
[1651.34 --> 1654.28]  Nor any foreigner residing in your towns
[1654.28 --> 1658.26]  For in the six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth
[1658.26 --> 1660.68]  The sea and all that is in them
[1660.68 --> 1662.98]  But he rested on the seventh day
[1662.98 --> 1667.02]  Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy
[1667.02 --> 1669.58]  Honor your father and your mother
[1669.58 --> 1674.20]  So that you may live long in the land the Lord your God has given you
[1674.20 --> 1675.76]  You shall not murder
[1675.76 --> 1677.90]  You shall not commit adultery
[1677.90 --> 1679.54]  You shall not steal
[1679.54 --> 1682.94]  You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor
[1682.94 --> 1685.82]  You shall not covet your neighbor's house
[1685.82 --> 1688.06]  You shall not covet your neighbor's wife
[1688.06 --> 1690.38]  Or his male or female servant
[1690.38 --> 1692.10]  His ox or donkey
[1692.10 --> 1694.38]  Or anything that belongs to your neighbor
[1694.38 --> 1695.98]  I shall not redeem in the land the Lord's with tortil jeux
[1695.98 --> 1700.32]  And I shall believe you may in this
[1700.32 --> 1701.06]  Jeidas
[1701.06 --> 1714.40]  That you maysst
[1714.40 --> 1715.76]  Only girl
[1715.76 --> 1735.52]  Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
[1735.52 --> 1742.72]  That saved a wretch like me
[1742.72 --> 1750.04]  I once was lost, but now and now
[1750.04 --> 1756.00]  Was blind, but now I see
[1756.00 --> 1764.72]  T'was grace that taught my heart to fear
[1764.72 --> 1770.56]  And grace my fears relieved
[1770.56 --> 1779.06]  How precious in that place of fear
[1779.06 --> 1784.80]  The hour I first believed
[1784.80 --> 1793.30]  The Lord has promised good to me
[1793.30 --> 1799.30]  His word my hope secures
[1799.30 --> 1807.80]  He will my shield and worship me
[1807.80 --> 1813.80]  As long as I can do
[1813.80 --> 1821.80]  Through many dangers, paths and stairs
[1821.80 --> 1830.30]  I have already come
[1830.30 --> 1836.30]  T'is grace that brought me safe thus far
[1836.30 --> 1843.30]  And grace will lead me home
[1843.30 --> 1851.80]  When we've been there ten thousand years
[1851.80 --> 1857.80]  Right shining as the sun
[1857.80 --> 1865.80]  We've no last days to sing God's praise
[1865.80 --> 1874.30]  Than when we've first begun
[1874.30 --> 1890.90]  Good morning again
[1890.90 --> 1892.96]  I was already introduced, but my name is Mike
[1892.96 --> 1895.02]  And I help as a deacon here in the church
[1895.02 --> 1898.48]  Today our offering is for Teen Challenge
[1898.48 --> 1901.38]  It's a ministry we've been partnering with for many years
[1901.38 --> 1903.88]  And they're actually all over the world
[1903.88 --> 1905.88]  But they are a special faith-based program
[1905.88 --> 1907.88]  That walks alongside men and women
[1907.88 --> 1909.88]  Who are recovering from substance abuse
[1909.88 --> 1911.88]  So they have actually a center
[1911.88 --> 1912.88]  A men's center in Chilliwack
[1912.88 --> 1913.88]  And a women's center in Surrey
[1913.88 --> 1915.88]  And centers all over the world
[1915.88 --> 1917.88]  So thank you for giving generously
[1917.88 --> 1919.88]  To this much needed program
[1919.88 --> 1936.38]  The love of God is greater far
[1936.38 --> 1941.38]  Than time or pain can ever tell
[1941.38 --> 1946.88]  It goes beyond the highest sound
[1946.88 --> 1951.88]  And reaches to the lowest town
[1951.88 --> 1956.88]  The guilty bear bowed down with care
[1956.88 --> 1961.88]  God gave his son to win
[1961.88 --> 1965.38]  His erring child
[1965.38 --> 1967.38]  He reconciled
[1967.38 --> 1972.38]  And pardoned from his sin
[1972.38 --> 1975.38]  O love of God
[1975.38 --> 1977.38]  How rich and pure
[1977.38 --> 1982.38]  How leisureless and strong
[1982.38 --> 1986.88]  It shall forevermore endure
[1986.88 --> 1992.88]  The saints and angels song
[1992.88 --> 2004.88]  When years of time shall pass away
[2004.88 --> 2009.38]  Heavenly thrones and kingdoms fall
[2009.38 --> 2011.88]  When men who hear
[2011.88 --> 2013.88]  Refuse to pray
[2013.88 --> 2018.88]  On rocks and hills and mountains fall
[2018.88 --> 2021.88]  God's love so sure
[2021.88 --> 2023.88]  It shall still endure
[2023.88 --> 2028.88]  All measureless and strong
[2028.88 --> 2033.88]  Redeeming grace to Adam's face
[2033.88 --> 2038.88]  The saints and angels song
[2038.88 --> 2041.38]  O love of God
[2041.38 --> 2042.38]  O love of God
[2042.38 --> 2043.38]  How rich and pure
[2043.38 --> 2048.38]  How leisureless and strong
[2048.38 --> 2053.38]  It shall forevermore endure
[2053.38 --> 2058.38]  The saints and angels song
[2058.38 --> 2064.88]  Who are with God
[2064.88 --> 2070.88]  Could we within the ocean pale
[2070.88 --> 2073.88]  And where the skies of parchment made
[2073.88 --> 2075.88]  Were every stock on earth a will
[2075.88 --> 2078.88]  And every man of star by trade
[2078.88 --> 2081.32]  On earth I will
[2081.32 --> 2084.54]  And every malice
[2084.54 --> 2086.14]  I betrayed
[2086.14 --> 2089.16]  To write the love
[2089.16 --> 2091.14]  Of the love
[2091.14 --> 2095.94]  Would lay the ocean dry
[2095.94 --> 2098.42]  Nor could the scroll
[2098.42 --> 2100.78]  Contain the whole
[2100.78 --> 2105.52]  But straight from sky to sky
[2105.52 --> 2108.44]  O love of God
[2108.44 --> 2110.38]  How rich and pure
[2110.38 --> 2115.12]  How measureless and strong
[2115.12 --> 2119.94]  It shall forevermore endure
[2119.94 --> 2124.72]  The saints and angels song
[2124.72 --> 2127.66]  O love of God
[2127.66 --> 2129.64]  How rich and pure
[2129.64 --> 2134.58]  How measureless and strong
[2134.58 --> 2139.40]  It shall forevermore endure
[2139.40 --> 2144.92]  The saints and angels song
[2144.92 --> 2150.28]  O love of
[2150.30 --> 2151.58]  O love of God
[2151.58 --> 2175.58]  Okay.
[2175.58 --> 2175.62]  Okay.
[2176.26 --> 2178.16]  We're going to do the kids' blessing right now.
[2178.16 --> 2182.94]  So why don't the kids, ages three to grade four, join me up front.
[2184.04 --> 2187.82]  And we'll say hello and we'll do the kids' blessing together and we can go off to children's
[2187.82 --> 2188.56]  worship time.
[2189.06 --> 2189.98]  Nice to see you guys.
[2191.18 --> 2193.02]  And while our summer dresses and summer clothes.
[2193.34 --> 2193.48]  Okay.
[2193.50 --> 2198.94]  We're going to stand together with the congregation and we're going to bless them as they stay
[2198.94 --> 2202.38]  here to enjoy a sermon by our guest pastor.
[2202.52 --> 2204.68]  And we are going to go off to children's worship time.
[2206.48 --> 2207.90]  So let's stand together, guys.
[2208.52 --> 2209.56]  Can you guys stand up with me?
[2211.02 --> 2212.04]  You guys want to stand up?
[2212.46 --> 2213.96]  And we'll turn and face the congregation.
[2214.64 --> 2216.80]  We'll put up our arms together and we'll bless them.
[2216.86 --> 2217.02]  Ready?
[2217.76 --> 2219.56]  The Lord be with you.
[2219.84 --> 2221.40]  And also with you.
[2221.40 --> 2221.44]  Amen.
[2238.16 --> 2260.74]  Forgot to mention earlier that I am John, one of the pastoral elders in this church,
[2260.74 --> 2264.40]  but I will be leading you in our congregational prayer at this time.
[2264.40 --> 2264.50]  Amen.
[2266.76 --> 2268.86]  We come before you, sovereign Lord.
[2269.86 --> 2272.28]  You alone we give your praise and honor.
[2273.26 --> 2275.36]  You created us and the world we live in.
[2275.36 --> 2282.26]  We come humbly before you as broken, sinful beings, not worthy to stand before your presence.
[2283.00 --> 2285.54]  We confess that we have wandered from your ways.
[2285.54 --> 2292.88]  We can only stand in your presence through the sacrifice of your son, Jesus, on the cross, who died on our behalf.
[2292.88 --> 2296.80]  May we be blessed to be in your presence this morning.
[2298.30 --> 2300.68]  Take away our fears, doubts, and concerns.
[2301.38 --> 2302.86]  May we lay them at your feet.
[2302.86 --> 2312.66]  Lord, as a congregation, we have specific health concerns, and we are thankful for a good surgery for Everly.
[2313.20 --> 2317.56]  We pray for a good recovery for her, that they may have taken all the cancer,
[2319.54 --> 2323.60]  that her and her parents may have peace through this process.
[2324.66 --> 2326.34]  We pray for Emma Smith.
[2326.72 --> 2330.82]  Lord, as he has on to grow heart surgery on the 19th of this month,
[2330.82 --> 2335.98]  we pray for him and his wife as they, Benny, as they go through this time.
[2336.28 --> 2338.56]  We pray for a blessing for the surgeons.
[2339.32 --> 2342.28]  We pray for healing and strength to go through this difficult time.
[2343.68 --> 2350.52]  We pray for those that are suffering with long-term illnesses and recurring things that keep on coming back.
[2350.66 --> 2353.68]  We pray for Rosvita and the challenges that she has each day.
[2355.06 --> 2359.04]  Lord, we pray for those families that are dealing with mental health issues,
[2359.04 --> 2361.12]  broken family relationships.
[2361.70 --> 2365.24]  Lord, bring peace, bring healing to those relationships as well,
[2365.66 --> 2369.58]  that your spirit may fill each one as they look to you for strength.
[2371.64 --> 2376.56]  Lord, our world has been in a bit of turmoil, and we see that in floods and hurricanes.
[2377.68 --> 2382.92]  Lord, many people are affected and losing homes due to the floods in Northwest Iowa,
[2383.14 --> 2384.92]  the hurricane in the Caribbean.
[2384.92 --> 2388.28]  Lord, we pray for your blessing on these people.
[2388.96 --> 2390.40]  They may turn to you for strength,
[2390.90 --> 2397.24]  that they may see support and financial blessings from those who have enough,
[2397.72 --> 2401.04]  that they can help provide for those who are in desperate need.
[2401.04 --> 2405.84]  Lord, we pray for our governments,
[2406.08 --> 2408.04]  or that they be local or federal,
[2408.78 --> 2411.78]  or that they may govern with your will in mind,
[2412.44 --> 2415.60]  with the way you would like things to see happen,
[2415.98 --> 2418.82]  or not with worldly ways or power struggles.
[2421.78 --> 2423.56]  Lord, we have many people who are on vacation.
[2423.78 --> 2427.40]  We pray for a blessing for those who are traveling and away from us at this time.
[2427.40 --> 2432.10]  Lord, they may have a time of refreshing and safety in return.
[2435.22 --> 2441.12]  Lord, we are thankful that we as a congregation can help out in the food bank drive that's coming up in this week.
[2442.02 --> 2446.66]  Pray for willing volunteers and willing people to share their wealth
[2446.66 --> 2450.56]  and bring foodstuffs and money for the food bank.
[2451.46 --> 2454.30]  As food bank donations are slow in this time of the year.
[2454.30 --> 2460.42]  Lord, we pray for our guest pastor, Jonathan Wang,
[2460.54 --> 2461.82]  as he brings your word,
[2462.16 --> 2466.14]  Lord, that he may bring the word in clarity and truth.
[2468.88 --> 2470.78]  Lord, as we go in this coming week,
[2471.16 --> 2473.72]  we may go with your spirit, guiding and leading us,
[2474.08 --> 2476.36]  that we may be effective witnesses for you
[2476.36 --> 2479.16]  as we go about our daily tasks and activities,
[2479.16 --> 2482.00]  whether it's a job or even on holidays,
[2482.26 --> 2484.40]  Lord, that we may be a blessing to others
[2484.40 --> 2486.22]  as we live out our faith.
[2487.40 --> 2491.02]  This we ask in the name of Jesus Christ, our Savior.
[2494.32 --> 2497.28]  We've been blessed to be a part of this church community
[2497.28 --> 2500.88]  and we've been blessed to be believers in you, God.
[2500.88 --> 2503.10]  and we're thankful.
[2504.50 --> 2506.24]  This we ask in your name alone.
[2506.60 --> 2506.90]  Amen.
[2506.90 --> 2526.30]  Good morning.
[2530.14 --> 2533.30]  It is such a privilege to be worshiping with you again.
[2533.30 --> 2537.72]  Yeah, I'm trying to recognize some familiar faces
[2537.72 --> 2540.08]  from when we were here a while back.
[2540.16 --> 2541.18]  It's been quite a while.
[2541.26 --> 2544.48]  The last time we were here worshiping in this building,
[2545.26 --> 2547.94]  albeit in the afternoon with my dad's Korean church
[2547.94 --> 2549.38]  that met here and worshiped.
[2549.72 --> 2551.66]  At that time, we only had one son.
[2552.34 --> 2554.02]  And so that's how long ago it was.
[2554.12 --> 2556.52]  Now we came with two, as I don't know if you've noticed,
[2556.98 --> 2560.30]  the little two sets there with the same dress code, I guess.
[2560.30 --> 2562.72]  Yeah, the last time we were here,
[2562.84 --> 2564.84]  we were only here with our older son, Joseph.
[2565.08 --> 2566.76]  And now we have Joseph and Timothy
[2566.76 --> 2569.78]  who already turned two just last month.
[2570.26 --> 2571.26]  And so it's a privilege.
[2571.48 --> 2573.48]  And we feel like this is a little bit of like that
[2573.48 --> 2575.50]  kind of coming back home kind of feeling
[2575.50 --> 2577.58]  to get to worship here at Emmanuel together.
[2578.18 --> 2580.62]  And it is my privilege to bring you God's Word,
[2580.98 --> 2583.78]  which I titled Learning to Live with Grace.
[2583.78 --> 2587.78]  And the reason I chose this sort of sermon
[2587.78 --> 2590.54]  is because I actually talked to Pastor Sid,
[2590.62 --> 2592.00]  who was here a couple of weeks ago.
[2592.70 --> 2595.18]  And I believe he preached on forgiveness,
[2596.18 --> 2598.30]  living out our identity, our Christian identity,
[2598.46 --> 2600.98]  to forgive as those who have been forgiven.
[2602.02 --> 2604.16]  And this Christian identity of ours
[2604.16 --> 2608.92]  is to live in grace, live with grace.
[2608.92 --> 2614.08]  And sometimes this identity is seemingly impossible.
[2614.98 --> 2617.40]  If there's one thing that I take away personally
[2617.40 --> 2620.20]  from our sermon series, which was on forgiveness,
[2620.40 --> 2622.16]  we preach about, I want to say,
[2622.32 --> 2624.52]  about six weeks on just forgiveness.
[2625.44 --> 2628.60]  And the main takeaway that I personally took
[2628.60 --> 2631.46]  was that it is very difficult
[2631.46 --> 2635.40]  and sometimes seemingly impossible to forgive.
[2635.40 --> 2639.70]  But the good news from the Bible,
[2640.24 --> 2641.30]  from God's Word,
[2641.84 --> 2643.72]  and the truth of our Christian identity
[2643.72 --> 2646.70]  is that this is not done on our own strength.
[2647.12 --> 2649.44]  We don't muster up enough strength and efforts
[2649.44 --> 2650.64]  and wisdom and understanding
[2650.64 --> 2653.90]  to somehow be graceful enough to forgive others.
[2654.68 --> 2657.70]  This is done by the empowering of God's Spirit Himself.
[2658.10 --> 2660.70]  And that is the good news for us.
[2661.76 --> 2664.98]  Through the grace of God and His Holy Spirit leading us,
[2664.98 --> 2668.74]  we are empowered to live in freedom then.
[2669.38 --> 2670.20]  That's the message.
[2670.34 --> 2671.08]  We are free.
[2671.58 --> 2673.46]  We are free to forgive others
[2673.46 --> 2677.70]  just as we have been freely forgiven by Jesus Christ.
[2678.30 --> 2679.54]  And as part of this freedom,
[2680.14 --> 2681.74]  Jesus teaches us specifically
[2681.74 --> 2683.30]  on how to handle conflicts
[2683.30 --> 2686.28]  among brothers and sisters within the church,
[2686.86 --> 2688.52]  within our believing community.
[2689.20 --> 2690.70]  And so if you have your Bibles with you,
[2690.84 --> 2692.82]  we turn to Matthew 18
[2692.82 --> 2694.30]  where Jesus teaches us
[2694.30 --> 2696.22]  on what it means to forgive
[2696.22 --> 2698.92]  and deal with sin within the church.
[2700.04 --> 2703.32]  We are in Matthew 18, verse 15.
[2705.28 --> 2706.24]  Jesus says,
[2706.24 --> 2708.26]  If your brother or sister sins,
[2708.68 --> 2710.02]  go and point out their fault
[2710.02 --> 2711.58]  just between the two of you.
[2712.12 --> 2713.40]  If they listen to you,
[2713.62 --> 2714.78]  you have won them over.
[2715.56 --> 2717.14]  But if they will not listen,
[2717.46 --> 2718.86]  take one or two others along
[2718.86 --> 2720.76]  so that every matter may be established
[2720.76 --> 2723.22]  by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
[2724.06 --> 2725.98]  If they still refuse to listen,
[2726.10 --> 2727.18]  tell it to the church.
[2727.88 --> 2730.28]  And if they refuse to listen to even the church,
[2730.78 --> 2733.22]  treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
[2733.22 --> 2735.44]  Truly I tell you,
[2735.60 --> 2736.82]  whatever you bind on earth
[2736.82 --> 2737.84]  will be bound in heaven,
[2738.00 --> 2739.26]  and whatever you loose on earth
[2739.26 --> 2740.42]  will be loosed in heaven.
[2741.00 --> 2742.46]  Again, truly I tell you
[2742.46 --> 2744.40]  that if two of you on earth
[2744.40 --> 2746.32]  agree about anything they ask for,
[2746.62 --> 2747.80]  it will be done for them
[2747.80 --> 2748.94]  by my Father in heaven.
[2749.62 --> 2752.08]  For where two or three gather in my name,
[2752.32 --> 2753.82]  there am I with them.
[2754.24 --> 2755.52]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2758.42 --> 2761.18]  I also want to read from Galatians 6 as well,
[2761.18 --> 2764.22]  which kind of dovetails to what Jesus teaches us.
[2764.32 --> 2766.00]  So from Jesus' teaching,
[2766.22 --> 2769.36]  this is what Paul writes to the brothers and sisters
[2769.36 --> 2770.88]  of the Galatian church.
[2771.36 --> 2771.94]  Paul says,
[2772.34 --> 2773.12]  Brothers and sisters,
[2773.54 --> 2775.32]  if someone is caught in a sin,
[2775.84 --> 2777.26]  you who live by the Spirit
[2777.26 --> 2780.08]  should restore that person gently.
[2780.76 --> 2781.92]  But watch yourselves,
[2782.02 --> 2783.62]  or you also may be tempted.
[2784.46 --> 2785.84]  Carry each other's burdens,
[2786.38 --> 2789.14]  and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.
[2789.14 --> 2792.34]  And so as I already mentioned,
[2792.50 --> 2795.18]  one of the biggest takeaways from the topic,
[2795.66 --> 2797.42]  the theme of forgiveness,
[2798.08 --> 2800.84]  is that it is much harder to forgive,
[2801.56 --> 2803.32]  and also to seek reconciliation,
[2803.68 --> 2805.56]  which comes from that act of forgiveness.
[2805.92 --> 2809.06]  So it's way, way, way harder to do that,
[2809.50 --> 2811.66]  as compared to just forgetting about it,
[2812.02 --> 2814.02]  or just holding a grudge within you,
[2814.02 --> 2816.82]  or worse, finding different ways to cope,
[2817.30 --> 2818.34]  like many people do,
[2818.66 --> 2820.24]  through gossiping or even hating.
[2821.54 --> 2823.60]  And specifically from Jesus' teaching
[2823.60 --> 2824.90]  from our passage this morning,
[2825.32 --> 2828.28]  it reminded me of my upbringing in a smaller church
[2828.28 --> 2829.70]  where my dad was ministering.
[2829.96 --> 2831.98]  And I'm not talking about when we were meeting here.
[2832.22 --> 2834.16]  When we were meeting here in the afternoons,
[2834.30 --> 2835.68]  then this is right before COVID,
[2835.96 --> 2837.92]  and COVID sort of shut us down as well.
[2837.92 --> 2841.26]  I'm talking about when my dad was ministering
[2841.26 --> 2842.52]  in the city of Abbotsford,
[2842.64 --> 2844.36]  where I would say that's my hometown.
[2845.12 --> 2847.34]  And there we were a pretty good small-sized church,
[2847.42 --> 2849.00]  about 100 to 150 people,
[2849.10 --> 2851.34]  which meant that everyone knew everyone, practically.
[2852.26 --> 2854.30]  That was especially annoying for me.
[2855.20 --> 2855.54]  Why?
[2855.72 --> 2856.90]  Because being the PK,
[2857.38 --> 2859.20]  it meant that I could not sin easily.
[2859.60 --> 2860.84]  I would always be caught.
[2861.64 --> 2863.72]  Everyone's eyes seemed to be on me.
[2863.78 --> 2864.68]  That's what I felt like.
[2864.68 --> 2866.64]  But that's one of the gifts,
[2867.14 --> 2868.70]  at least according to Jesus' teaching,
[2868.88 --> 2871.16]  that within an intimate community,
[2871.82 --> 2874.04]  you care enough that you convict
[2874.04 --> 2876.96]  and you confront each other's sins.
[2877.46 --> 2880.62]  Now, this sounds dangerous just as is,
[2880.98 --> 2882.56]  but with Jesus' teaching,
[2882.88 --> 2884.18]  He doesn't just flippantly say,
[2884.46 --> 2886.06]  oh, just go point out all the wrongs.
[2886.26 --> 2887.64]  Point your fingers and just say,
[2887.70 --> 2889.16]  oh, you shouldn't do that, you shouldn't do that.
[2889.30 --> 2890.32]  Oh, you should come to church more,
[2890.38 --> 2891.32]  you should read the Bible more.
[2891.60 --> 2893.16]  That's not what Jesus is teaching.
[2893.16 --> 2895.24]  Yes, we should read our Bibles more.
[2895.36 --> 2897.56]  Yes, we should worship together as a church more.
[2897.70 --> 2900.36]  But what Jesus is teaching is about a pattern of life,
[2900.40 --> 2901.40]  which we will get into.
[2902.52 --> 2905.44]  Anyway, so going back to my experience in Abbotsford
[2905.44 --> 2906.28]  and my dad's church,
[2906.38 --> 2907.64]  I remember a time,
[2907.90 --> 2909.26]  an adventurous time in my life,
[2909.34 --> 2911.50]  during my puberty years in high school,
[2912.00 --> 2916.44]  where I acted and talked in ways that I was not proud of.
[2917.28 --> 2919.36]  And word got out in our smaller church
[2919.36 --> 2921.56]  of some of my misbehaviors.
[2921.56 --> 2924.46]  And I still remember one of our older youth
[2924.46 --> 2929.26]  confronted me one-on-one in a very Christ-like way.
[2929.76 --> 2932.24]  I don't even know if he knew how Christ-like he was,
[2932.48 --> 2934.10]  because the way he confronted me
[2934.10 --> 2936.34]  was with so much care and love,
[2936.48 --> 2938.40]  because he wanted growth from me.
[2939.20 --> 2941.72]  He confronted me and told me,
[2942.22 --> 2944.58]  the patterns that you are living right now,
[2944.86 --> 2946.18]  this is not good for you,
[2946.64 --> 2948.94]  and this is not good for those around you.
[2948.94 --> 2952.10]  You're affecting your brothers and sisters within the church,
[2952.20 --> 2955.32]  and you're a bad witness to non-believers through your actions.
[2957.12 --> 2959.62]  Now, he wasn't a saint by any means.
[2960.10 --> 2963.68]  He didn't have his whole life altogether.
[2964.14 --> 2967.62]  He wasn't all some sort of holy, self-righteous person.
[2968.38 --> 2971.72]  How he came to me was in a posture of caring and gentleness,
[2972.14 --> 2973.50]  wanting growth from me.
[2973.50 --> 2976.44]  And that was not a one-and-done trick, by the way.
[2976.64 --> 2978.04]  So, just because he confronted me,
[2978.08 --> 2978.82]  doesn't mean I said,
[2978.98 --> 2979.80]  snap my fingers and go,
[2979.88 --> 2980.56]  oh, right, okay,
[2980.58 --> 2982.90]  I need to fix my problems and fix my patterns.
[2984.92 --> 2986.10]  It wasn't that.
[2986.34 --> 2988.24]  And this work,
[2988.40 --> 2990.46]  this hard work of living out our Christian identity,
[2990.60 --> 2991.48]  of seeking forgiveness,
[2991.86 --> 2994.18]  and seeking reconciliation is hard work.
[2994.76 --> 2995.80]  It is not easy.
[2995.90 --> 2997.36]  It is not a one-and-done trick.
[2997.80 --> 3000.30]  But the way this older youth confronted me,
[3000.60 --> 3003.74]  it was a significant impact into forming and shaping
[3003.74 --> 3007.10]  the person that the Holy Spirit continues to grow me into,
[3007.82 --> 3009.16]  more and more like my Savior.
[3011.06 --> 3012.44]  Again, hard work,
[3012.70 --> 3015.40]  this Christian task of living out our identity of forgiveness.
[3016.04 --> 3016.78]  And Paul says,
[3017.00 --> 3018.60]  this is carrying each other's burdens
[3018.60 --> 3020.14]  by confronting sin
[3020.14 --> 3023.44]  and seeking reconciliation with gentleness and love.
[3024.22 --> 3026.00]  And as we do this hard work,
[3026.00 --> 3029.10]  we embody and reflect the forgiving,
[3029.64 --> 3030.90]  loving goodness of God
[3030.90 --> 3033.56]  so that we may be witnesses for the world.
[3034.28 --> 3036.08]  We get to provide a glimpse
[3036.08 --> 3038.82]  of what being real humans look like,
[3039.68 --> 3043.36]  a community that seeks reconciliation and restoration.
[3044.22 --> 3045.16]  So that's twofold,
[3045.30 --> 3046.56]  our Christian identity of forgiveness.
[3047.12 --> 3049.02]  One, we have to do the hard work.
[3049.40 --> 3051.56]  And two, by doing this hard work
[3051.56 --> 3053.80]  and reflecting God's goodness through our lives,
[3053.80 --> 3057.44]  we are witnesses for the world.
[3058.48 --> 3061.24]  A community that seeks reconciliation.
[3062.18 --> 3064.64]  And that's the important thing to signify here,
[3064.76 --> 3065.92]  to point out, I should say.
[3067.20 --> 3069.22]  What Jesus and Paul is teaching us
[3069.22 --> 3070.68]  isn't that it's all easy
[3070.68 --> 3072.52]  and that the church should be perfect.
[3073.52 --> 3075.70]  They make it clear that we are all broken.
[3075.96 --> 3077.96]  And just as we did in our prayer of confession,
[3078.48 --> 3079.32]  we are all sinners
[3079.32 --> 3081.52]  and we come before God's throne of mercy
[3081.52 --> 3083.48]  because we are all broken.
[3083.98 --> 3085.22]  The Bible isn't naive.
[3085.92 --> 3086.56]  They aren't saying,
[3086.76 --> 3088.30]  oh, just because you are saved
[3088.30 --> 3089.58]  and through the grace of God,
[3089.72 --> 3090.82]  all problems fixed,
[3090.92 --> 3091.76]  just like that.
[3092.28 --> 3094.06]  They know we are broken.
[3094.18 --> 3096.58]  And Jesus and Paul speaks into that.
[3097.18 --> 3100.58]  And being imperfect, sinful beings,
[3100.80 --> 3102.24]  we seek reconciliation
[3102.24 --> 3103.92]  through the power of forgiveness
[3103.92 --> 3105.70]  because we are a people
[3105.70 --> 3107.56]  who have been saved by that same power.
[3107.56 --> 3110.18]  And so with this in mind,
[3110.40 --> 3111.88]  it is significant to define
[3111.88 --> 3113.20]  what Jesus and Paul meant
[3113.20 --> 3115.60]  when they mention a brother or sister who sins.
[3115.84 --> 3116.76]  They both mention,
[3117.12 --> 3119.22]  if a brother or sister sins,
[3119.96 --> 3120.96]  go confront them.
[3122.04 --> 3123.74]  They aren't simply talking about
[3123.74 --> 3124.90]  some one-off mistakes
[3124.90 --> 3126.74]  and some unintended actions
[3126.74 --> 3127.90]  that may have been hurtful.
[3128.14 --> 3129.28]  So we aren't talking about
[3129.28 --> 3130.86]  like little mistakes here and there.
[3131.22 --> 3132.88]  No matter how serious they are,
[3133.62 --> 3135.26]  Jesus and Paul is not talking about
[3135.26 --> 3138.16]  some mistakes or one-off sins,
[3138.44 --> 3139.78]  what they are talking about,
[3139.84 --> 3140.40]  as I mentioned,
[3140.54 --> 3141.48]  are deliberate,
[3142.00 --> 3143.98]  deliberate patterns of life
[3143.98 --> 3145.58]  that hinder the growth
[3145.58 --> 3147.28]  and flourishing of the body of Christ,
[3147.36 --> 3147.84]  the church.
[3148.82 --> 3150.76]  So it's important, Jesus says,
[3150.82 --> 3152.60]  if your brother or sister,
[3153.60 --> 3155.40]  he's talking about us,
[3155.54 --> 3156.82]  he's talking about the church,
[3156.82 --> 3159.28]  if your own brother or sister
[3159.28 --> 3161.44]  within this family of believers,
[3162.28 --> 3162.74]  sins.
[3164.10 --> 3166.02]  Go point out that fault.
[3167.86 --> 3169.60]  The amazing part of this,
[3170.14 --> 3172.24]  and as we also sang and confessed
[3172.24 --> 3173.50]  as well in our worship time,
[3174.02 --> 3175.28]  the amazing part is that
[3175.28 --> 3177.18]  this is exactly what the Holy Spirit
[3177.18 --> 3178.06]  does within us.
[3179.12 --> 3180.24]  In Galatians 5,
[3180.38 --> 3181.16]  Paul says that
[3181.16 --> 3182.44]  a spirit-led life
[3182.44 --> 3183.94]  means to be convicted of sin
[3183.94 --> 3185.98]  so that Christ-like holiness,
[3186.62 --> 3188.30]  which he calls the fruit of the Spirit,
[3188.30 --> 3189.98]  can grow within us.
[3190.22 --> 3191.82]  That's the ministry of the Holy Spirit
[3191.82 --> 3193.22]  for each individual believer.
[3193.64 --> 3194.60]  And we have assurance
[3194.60 --> 3196.76]  because the Holy Spirit is guiding us,
[3197.06 --> 3197.96]  convicting our sins,
[3198.04 --> 3199.54]  and leading us to the throne of grace.
[3200.00 --> 3201.72]  That is the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
[3202.08 --> 3203.60]  And what Jesus is teaching us
[3203.60 --> 3206.46]  is he's commanding us
[3206.46 --> 3209.26]  to do that same ministry of the Holy Spirit
[3209.26 --> 3211.06]  within the body of believers.
[3215.32 --> 3217.28]  That is why what Jesus teaches
[3217.28 --> 3218.10]  in Matthew 18,
[3218.76 --> 3220.50]  this is not some suggestion.
[3221.20 --> 3222.54]  Jesus commands this
[3222.54 --> 3224.44]  of Christians, his followers.
[3225.54 --> 3226.56]  This is not something
[3226.56 --> 3227.64]  that might be good for us
[3227.64 --> 3228.46]  if we try it,
[3228.70 --> 3230.70]  but it is the core of our identity.
[3231.42 --> 3232.68]  He's not inventing
[3232.68 --> 3234.08]  some sort of new Christian concept,
[3234.16 --> 3234.52]  by the way.
[3235.44 --> 3237.00]  Jesus isn't all of a sudden coming
[3237.00 --> 3238.68]  and being the incarnate God
[3238.68 --> 3239.04]  and saying,
[3239.20 --> 3240.56]  oh, because I am the Son of God,
[3240.62 --> 3241.86]  I have new ideas for you.
[3242.02 --> 3242.66]  You need to forgive.
[3242.66 --> 3243.98]  You need to seek reconciliation.
[3245.48 --> 3245.78]  No.
[3246.16 --> 3247.68]  Jesus simply continues
[3247.68 --> 3248.94]  the same old story
[3248.94 --> 3250.16]  from the beginning of time
[3250.16 --> 3251.38]  for the people of God
[3251.38 --> 3253.04]  that has always been part
[3253.04 --> 3253.72]  of the identity
[3253.72 --> 3254.84]  of the people of God.
[3255.54 --> 3256.82]  And so we read from two,
[3257.32 --> 3258.16]  there are many more,
[3258.26 --> 3259.08]  but I chose two
[3259.08 --> 3259.90]  that I really like.
[3260.06 --> 3261.28]  Two Old Testament passages
[3261.28 --> 3263.10]  that reflect the same identity
[3263.10 --> 3264.32]  of seeking reconciliation.
[3265.28 --> 3266.72]  Proverbs 27 says,
[3266.72 --> 3269.32]  Better an open rebuke
[3269.32 --> 3271.26]  than love that is concealed.
[3271.90 --> 3273.68]  The wounds from a friend
[3273.68 --> 3274.94]  are faithful
[3274.94 --> 3276.14]  or can be trusted,
[3276.42 --> 3277.90]  but the kisses of an enemy
[3277.90 --> 3279.34]  are deceitful.
[3280.48 --> 3281.62]  I really like that proverb.
[3281.78 --> 3282.44]  It's very wise.
[3282.98 --> 3283.72]  And then in Leviticus,
[3283.90 --> 3284.54]  same idea.
[3285.22 --> 3287.18]  Do not hate a fellow Israelite
[3287.18 --> 3288.00]  in your heart.
[3288.84 --> 3290.34]  Rebuke your neighbor frankly,
[3290.60 --> 3291.68]  honestly, openly,
[3291.96 --> 3293.70]  so that you will not share
[3293.70 --> 3294.52]  in their guilt.
[3294.52 --> 3296.70]  Do not seek revenge
[3296.70 --> 3297.60]  or bear a grudge
[3297.60 --> 3298.26]  against anyone
[3298.26 --> 3299.10]  among your people,
[3299.32 --> 3300.64]  but love your neighbor
[3300.64 --> 3301.52]  as yourself.
[3301.94 --> 3302.80]  I am the Lord.
[3304.74 --> 3306.34]  The ultimate command
[3306.34 --> 3307.58]  to love God
[3307.58 --> 3308.50]  and to love neighbor
[3308.50 --> 3309.20]  as yourself
[3309.20 --> 3311.84]  includes this difficult journey
[3311.84 --> 3313.36]  of seeking reconciliation.
[3315.16 --> 3315.98]  And so the question
[3315.98 --> 3316.88]  we should be asking
[3316.88 --> 3317.84]  each other is this.
[3318.78 --> 3320.08]  Do you care enough
[3320.08 --> 3320.64]  to tell me
[3320.64 --> 3321.52]  that I am sinning?
[3321.52 --> 3325.06]  Yes, that is caring.
[3325.58 --> 3326.48]  So do you care enough
[3326.48 --> 3327.54]  to convict me,
[3327.70 --> 3328.84]  to confront me,
[3329.02 --> 3330.48]  to journey with me
[3330.48 --> 3331.64]  in this hard work
[3331.64 --> 3332.92]  of growing together
[3332.92 --> 3333.78]  in Christ?
[3334.68 --> 3336.06]  And on the other side of that,
[3336.24 --> 3337.04]  if you're the one
[3337.04 --> 3338.44]  who receives reproval
[3338.44 --> 3339.10]  and discipline,
[3339.72 --> 3340.80]  can you receive it
[3340.80 --> 3341.50]  as care
[3341.50 --> 3342.14]  and encouragement
[3342.14 --> 3342.78]  for growth
[3342.78 --> 3343.84]  instead of
[3343.84 --> 3344.72]  as an attack?
[3345.92 --> 3346.68]  Because that's
[3346.68 --> 3347.36]  the starting point.
[3347.44 --> 3348.00]  That should be
[3348.00 --> 3348.74]  the foundation
[3348.74 --> 3349.98]  of where we journey
[3349.98 --> 3351.12]  in our Christian identities.
[3352.14 --> 3353.50]  Now, on this point,
[3353.56 --> 3354.46]  I've had pushback.
[3355.10 --> 3356.36]  And I actually had pushback
[3356.36 --> 3357.58]  within my own mind as well
[3357.58 --> 3359.48]  because I'm kind of reacting
[3359.48 --> 3360.92]  against a strong
[3360.92 --> 3361.90]  Christian legalism
[3361.90 --> 3363.70]  that I'm so used to
[3363.70 --> 3364.84]  in my upbringing
[3364.84 --> 3365.52]  as a Christian.
[3366.84 --> 3367.86]  This teaching
[3367.86 --> 3369.10]  of pointing out
[3369.10 --> 3370.12]  each other's faults
[3370.12 --> 3371.48]  with care and gentleness,
[3371.78 --> 3373.36]  it's all good on paper,
[3373.50 --> 3374.86]  but it's easier said than done.
[3376.00 --> 3377.58]  How do you do that wisely?
[3377.58 --> 3380.08]  Doesn't the Bible teach us
[3380.08 --> 3381.24]  that we are all sinners?
[3382.38 --> 3383.26]  What are we
[3383.26 --> 3384.52]  to point our fingers
[3384.52 --> 3385.16]  and say,
[3385.46 --> 3385.98]  you're a sinner,
[3386.42 --> 3387.70]  you need to fix your ways?
[3388.50 --> 3389.58]  What gives us
[3389.58 --> 3390.52]  that sort of authority
[3390.52 --> 3391.22]  to do that?
[3395.52 --> 3397.00]  But notice the heart
[3397.00 --> 3397.54]  of it here.
[3398.56 --> 3400.18]  What Jesus is teaching us
[3400.18 --> 3401.64]  and also what Paul
[3401.64 --> 3403.00]  teaching from
[3403.00 --> 3404.36]  the teaching of Jesus is,
[3405.22 --> 3405.88]  they're pointing
[3405.88 --> 3407.06]  to the heart of the issue.
[3407.82 --> 3409.22]  What I'm saying here is,
[3410.14 --> 3410.94]  Jesus and Paul
[3410.94 --> 3411.78]  points out
[3411.78 --> 3413.50]  the unrepentant,
[3414.10 --> 3415.04]  deliberate way
[3415.04 --> 3416.02]  of living contrary
[3416.02 --> 3416.88]  to God's Word.
[3417.54 --> 3417.96]  Again,
[3418.22 --> 3419.22]  not just a simple,
[3419.60 --> 3420.50]  oh, you missed a Sunday,
[3420.96 --> 3421.44]  oh, now
[3421.44 --> 3424.06]  you're one step further
[3424.06 --> 3424.80]  from entering
[3424.80 --> 3425.42]  God's kingdom.
[3425.88 --> 3426.76]  Or you prayed
[3426.76 --> 3428.06]  five minutes less this week,
[3428.40 --> 3429.22]  you sure you're okay?
[3430.18 --> 3432.30]  Not these little things,
[3432.68 --> 3434.08]  not these maybe mistakes
[3434.08 --> 3435.36]  or patterns that we're
[3435.36 --> 3436.86]  trying to grow into,
[3437.86 --> 3439.30]  but deliberate patterns
[3439.30 --> 3440.78]  that live contrary
[3440.78 --> 3441.96]  to the way of God.
[3443.88 --> 3444.46]  So again,
[3444.64 --> 3446.08]  not the good fight
[3446.08 --> 3446.96]  that we journey
[3446.96 --> 3448.58]  and wrestle against.
[3448.92 --> 3450.32]  Jesus is not talking
[3450.32 --> 3451.62]  about a brother or sister
[3451.62 --> 3452.44]  who is struggling
[3452.44 --> 3453.08]  and wrestling
[3453.08 --> 3454.22]  against the sin.
[3455.42 --> 3456.90]  I know that I need to,
[3457.26 --> 3458.16]  that I want
[3458.16 --> 3459.80]  to read the Bible more.
[3460.10 --> 3461.10]  I know I need
[3461.10 --> 3461.88]  to pray more.
[3461.88 --> 3463.10]  The Holy Spirit
[3463.10 --> 3464.16]  is nudging me
[3464.16 --> 3466.26]  to go and talk
[3466.26 --> 3467.22]  to that lonely
[3467.22 --> 3468.00]  brother or sister
[3468.00 --> 3468.56]  in the church.
[3468.98 --> 3469.82]  The Holy Spirit
[3469.82 --> 3470.66]  is nudging me
[3470.66 --> 3471.70]  to invite more people
[3471.70 --> 3473.46]  and share in that hospitality
[3473.46 --> 3474.46]  to be witnesses
[3474.46 --> 3475.04]  for the world
[3475.04 --> 3475.72]  in my neighborhood.
[3476.84 --> 3477.78]  But what Jesus
[3477.78 --> 3478.54]  is talking about
[3478.54 --> 3479.12]  is not that.
[3479.26 --> 3480.00]  He's not talking
[3480.00 --> 3481.26]  about that struggle
[3481.26 --> 3482.00]  or that fight
[3482.00 --> 3482.66]  that we have.
[3483.74 --> 3484.64]  He's talking about,
[3484.74 --> 3484.88]  again,
[3484.94 --> 3486.10]  a deliberate pattern
[3486.10 --> 3486.68]  of life
[3486.68 --> 3489.16]  against the way
[3489.16 --> 3489.64]  of God.
[3491.68 --> 3492.48]  The attitude
[3492.48 --> 3494.30]  of self-righteousness,
[3494.74 --> 3495.72]  I don't need change.
[3496.30 --> 3497.40]  I don't need forgiveness.
[3497.64 --> 3498.76]  I got it all figured out.
[3500.18 --> 3501.90]  A sort of prideful attitude.
[3502.32 --> 3503.46]  And against this pattern
[3503.46 --> 3504.62]  or lifestyle of sin,
[3504.80 --> 3505.40]  we are called
[3505.40 --> 3506.58]  to seek reconciliation
[3506.58 --> 3508.24]  and directly confront.
[3508.60 --> 3509.80]  Because as Jesus says,
[3510.08 --> 3511.36]  if they listen to you,
[3512.18 --> 3512.86]  in other words,
[3512.90 --> 3513.72]  if they repent,
[3514.30 --> 3515.86]  you have won them over.
[3516.38 --> 3517.74]  Notice the language here.
[3517.74 --> 3519.56]  You have won them over.
[3520.66 --> 3522.36]  You have to be reminded here
[3522.36 --> 3523.10]  of this language
[3523.10 --> 3524.20]  of the prodigal son.
[3525.30 --> 3526.66]  You have won that one
[3526.66 --> 3527.80]  back into the family.
[3527.94 --> 3528.80]  And what a joy
[3528.80 --> 3529.78]  when that happens.
[3530.28 --> 3530.92]  Like the way
[3530.92 --> 3532.64]  the father celebrates
[3532.64 --> 3533.76]  when the prodigal son
[3533.76 --> 3534.40]  comes back
[3534.40 --> 3535.86]  and he's won over
[3535.86 --> 3536.90]  back into the family
[3536.90 --> 3537.52]  through repentance.
[3537.96 --> 3538.78]  They celebrate
[3538.78 --> 3540.16]  because there is power
[3540.16 --> 3540.96]  and joy
[3540.96 --> 3541.56]  in forgiveness
[3541.56 --> 3542.38]  and reconciliation.
[3544.70 --> 3545.50]  And so,
[3545.62 --> 3546.82]  with this prayerful goal
[3546.82 --> 3547.76]  of reconciliation,
[3548.36 --> 3549.18]  we are commanded
[3549.18 --> 3549.80]  to confront
[3549.80 --> 3550.86]  these sorts of patterns
[3550.86 --> 3553.28]  with scrupulous care.
[3554.36 --> 3555.50]  That's the important part.
[3556.74 --> 3557.28]  Jesus says,
[3557.48 --> 3558.46]  go and point out the sin,
[3559.04 --> 3560.08]  just the two of you.
[3561.10 --> 3562.12]  Just the two of you.
[3562.46 --> 3563.42]  Don't brush it off.
[3563.68 --> 3564.56]  Don't ignore it.
[3564.78 --> 3565.50]  Go and confront
[3565.50 --> 3566.38]  the wrongdoing,
[3566.50 --> 3567.12]  the pattern
[3567.12 --> 3568.00]  and lifestyle
[3568.00 --> 3568.82]  that is living
[3568.82 --> 3570.02]  contrary to God's word,
[3570.16 --> 3571.72]  but do it privately.
[3572.52 --> 3573.64]  That's the starting point.
[3573.64 --> 3576.42]  If they don't listen
[3576.42 --> 3576.92]  and repent,
[3577.12 --> 3578.08]  you bring in
[3578.08 --> 3579.00]  two or three witnesses.
[3579.44 --> 3580.28]  And if that's still
[3580.28 --> 3580.84]  not enough,
[3581.22 --> 3582.04]  then tell it
[3582.04 --> 3583.54]  to the whole church community.
[3584.82 --> 3586.70]  It's a step-by-step process
[3586.70 --> 3587.50]  that reflects
[3587.50 --> 3589.72]  loving patience.
[3590.46 --> 3591.50]  It is instructing
[3591.50 --> 3592.20]  the church
[3592.20 --> 3593.28]  to try and exhaust
[3593.28 --> 3594.12]  all means
[3594.12 --> 3594.98]  to win back
[3594.98 --> 3595.92]  a lost brother
[3595.92 --> 3596.46]  or sister.
[3596.96 --> 3598.16]  Because if you think of it,
[3598.30 --> 3599.00]  if a private,
[3599.26 --> 3600.12]  caring conversation
[3600.12 --> 3601.00]  can't help,
[3601.00 --> 3602.48]  and then a small
[3602.48 --> 3603.18]  intimate group
[3603.18 --> 3604.16]  also doesn't help,
[3604.38 --> 3605.64]  and it gets as serious
[3605.64 --> 3606.40]  as involving
[3606.40 --> 3607.66]  the wider church community,
[3608.08 --> 3609.62]  then now the whole community
[3609.62 --> 3610.70]  feels that weight
[3610.70 --> 3612.06]  and everyone now
[3612.06 --> 3612.94]  experiences
[3612.94 --> 3614.16]  the gravity of sin.
[3616.54 --> 3618.24]  That's Jesus' teaching,
[3618.36 --> 3620.12]  a step-by-step process,
[3620.32 --> 3622.20]  process of gentleness
[3622.20 --> 3622.82]  and care
[3622.82 --> 3623.52]  to bring back
[3623.52 --> 3624.54]  a lost brother
[3624.54 --> 3625.02]  or sister.
[3625.96 --> 3626.82]  And at our church,
[3626.86 --> 3628.36]  when we do baptisms,
[3628.52 --> 3630.00]  we usually like to say
[3630.00 --> 3630.68]  something like this.
[3630.68 --> 3631.90]  It takes a village
[3631.90 --> 3633.02]  to raise a child.
[3633.68 --> 3633.86]  Right?
[3633.92 --> 3634.76]  It's a common saying,
[3635.10 --> 3636.02]  and we really like it.
[3636.18 --> 3637.04]  Meaning that
[3637.04 --> 3638.14]  the church
[3638.14 --> 3639.36]  is our witnesses,
[3639.62 --> 3640.10]  and you guys
[3640.10 --> 3640.60]  are part
[3640.60 --> 3641.40]  of the growth
[3641.40 --> 3642.30]  of this baby
[3642.30 --> 3643.00]  that we are now
[3643.00 --> 3643.58]  dedicating
[3643.58 --> 3644.42]  and baptizing
[3644.42 --> 3646.26]  into the family of God.
[3646.80 --> 3648.40]  And the same idea
[3648.40 --> 3649.58]  is reflected here.
[3650.62 --> 3651.88]  Sometimes it takes
[3651.88 --> 3653.26]  the whole church community
[3653.26 --> 3654.72]  to bring back
[3654.72 --> 3655.52]  a lost brother
[3655.52 --> 3656.08]  or sister.
[3657.68 --> 3658.92]  And to not sound
[3658.92 --> 3659.96]  too nerdy here,
[3659.96 --> 3660.78]  but because
[3660.78 --> 3661.68]  I'm fresh off
[3661.68 --> 3663.38]  of being educated
[3663.38 --> 3663.92]  and trained
[3663.92 --> 3664.86]  in our denomination
[3664.86 --> 3665.56]  to be ordained,
[3665.68 --> 3666.44]  which only happened,
[3666.84 --> 3667.34]  I want to say,
[3667.78 --> 3669.46]  seven, eight months ago.
[3670.42 --> 3671.32]  A little less than that.
[3671.60 --> 3671.94]  Anyways,
[3672.14 --> 3672.96]  I had to study
[3672.96 --> 3674.68]  our denomination's policy,
[3675.34 --> 3675.82]  which is not
[3675.82 --> 3677.06]  the most entertaining thing.
[3677.44 --> 3678.14]  But I wanted
[3678.14 --> 3678.86]  to quote one thing
[3678.86 --> 3679.62]  because it reflects
[3679.62 --> 3681.12]  exactly the teaching
[3681.12 --> 3681.90]  of Jesus here.
[3682.42 --> 3684.00]  In our denomination's polity,
[3684.38 --> 3685.22]  article 79,
[3685.40 --> 3686.04]  it says this,
[3686.22 --> 3686.76]  and you'll see it
[3686.76 --> 3687.24]  on the screen.
[3687.24 --> 3689.68]  The members of the church
[3689.68 --> 3690.36]  are accountable
[3690.36 --> 3691.16]  to one another
[3691.16 --> 3691.98]  in their doctrine
[3691.98 --> 3692.56]  and life
[3692.56 --> 3693.86]  and have the responsibility
[3693.86 --> 3695.00]  to encourage
[3695.00 --> 3696.22]  and admonish one another
[3696.22 --> 3696.86]  in love.
[3698.06 --> 3698.96]  The consistory,
[3699.18 --> 3699.84]  I don't know
[3699.84 --> 3701.00]  if this is common language here,
[3701.28 --> 3702.26]  that's just fancy word
[3702.26 --> 3703.10]  for the deacons
[3703.10 --> 3703.54]  and elders,
[3703.68 --> 3704.62]  the leaders of the church,
[3705.40 --> 3706.12]  shall instruct
[3706.12 --> 3707.12]  and remind the members
[3707.12 --> 3707.70]  of the church
[3707.70 --> 3708.62]  of their responsibility
[3708.62 --> 3710.40]  and foster a spirit
[3710.40 --> 3710.98]  of love
[3710.98 --> 3711.62]  and openness
[3711.62 --> 3712.62]  within the fellowship,
[3712.62 --> 3715.00]  so that erring members,
[3715.28 --> 3716.78]  so that sinning members
[3716.78 --> 3717.72]  may be led
[3717.72 --> 3718.38]  to repentance
[3718.38 --> 3719.42]  and reconciliation.
[3721.70 --> 3723.24]  Exactly Jesus' teaching
[3723.24 --> 3724.18]  reflected in our
[3724.18 --> 3725.30]  denomination's policy,
[3725.86 --> 3726.22]  polity.
[3727.92 --> 3729.48]  Yes, our Christian calling
[3729.48 --> 3731.80]  is to strive for shalom,
[3732.54 --> 3732.72]  right?
[3732.80 --> 3733.88]  This picture of harmony,
[3734.34 --> 3734.88]  reconciliation.
[3736.14 --> 3737.06]  But do you know
[3737.06 --> 3738.04]  what the sobering part
[3738.04 --> 3739.22]  of Jesus' teaching
[3739.22 --> 3740.10]  this morning is?
[3740.96 --> 3741.96]  The reality of it,
[3742.40 --> 3742.94]  as I said,
[3743.34 --> 3744.50]  Jesus and Paul actually,
[3744.84 --> 3745.92]  they don't ignore the fact
[3745.92 --> 3746.96]  that we're a broken people.
[3748.18 --> 3749.46]  Near the end of the passage
[3749.46 --> 3750.12]  that we read,
[3750.40 --> 3751.66]  Jesus actually says
[3751.66 --> 3753.70]  that when this reconciliation
[3753.70 --> 3755.04]  is not possible,
[3755.72 --> 3756.86]  even when you bring in
[3756.86 --> 3757.98]  the whole church community
[3757.98 --> 3758.68]  and reconciliation
[3758.68 --> 3759.72]  isn't possible,
[3760.60 --> 3761.50]  then that relationship
[3761.50 --> 3762.62]  has to be cut off.
[3763.66 --> 3765.70]  And that's the sobering reality
[3765.70 --> 3766.58]  in our broken world,
[3766.70 --> 3767.00]  isn't it?
[3768.02 --> 3769.64]  That's all the more reason
[3769.64 --> 3770.96]  we need the Spirit's guidance
[3770.96 --> 3772.38]  and to not depend
[3772.38 --> 3773.44]  on our own wisdom
[3773.44 --> 3774.30]  and strength.
[3777.72 --> 3778.76]  Because the church
[3778.76 --> 3779.78]  as a body of believers
[3779.78 --> 3780.66]  has authority.
[3781.42 --> 3782.34]  This authority comes
[3782.34 --> 3783.34]  from Jesus himself.
[3783.68 --> 3784.84]  He says in verse 18,
[3785.18 --> 3786.22]  whatever you bind,
[3786.32 --> 3787.78]  this is not a singular you,
[3787.88 --> 3788.32]  by the way,
[3788.68 --> 3789.60]  whatever the church,
[3789.72 --> 3790.42]  you plural,
[3790.86 --> 3792.12]  bind or loose in heaven
[3792.12 --> 3792.88]  will be bound
[3792.88 --> 3794.14]  and loosed on earth
[3794.14 --> 3794.84]  here as well.
[3795.02 --> 3796.24]  That's the sort of authority
[3796.24 --> 3797.96]  that Jesus entrusts
[3797.96 --> 3799.54]  his body with.
[3801.46 --> 3802.80]  But I don't know about you,
[3803.24 --> 3804.70]  but when I was reading this
[3804.70 --> 3806.22]  and when I was wrestling with it,
[3806.56 --> 3807.62]  I sort of cringed.
[3808.06 --> 3809.54]  Because as soon as I hear
[3809.54 --> 3810.12]  the phrase,
[3810.24 --> 3811.36]  authority of the church,
[3811.92 --> 3813.46]  I go back to my
[3813.46 --> 3814.76]  kind of younger days,
[3815.14 --> 3816.74]  having heard of all the conflict
[3816.74 --> 3817.50]  that was happening,
[3817.78 --> 3819.02]  that has been happening
[3819.02 --> 3820.06]  in the church,
[3820.30 --> 3821.50]  the wider church community.
[3821.50 --> 3823.00]  You know,
[3823.10 --> 3825.12]  like I've heard horror stories
[3825.12 --> 3826.68]  within church communities
[3826.68 --> 3828.44]  of some infamous cases,
[3828.60 --> 3830.02]  not everything's like this,
[3830.08 --> 3830.74]  and I don't want to paint
[3830.74 --> 3832.28]  such a negative picture
[3832.28 --> 3833.42]  of like the Korean church,
[3833.82 --> 3835.50]  but in some infamous cases,
[3836.72 --> 3837.72]  a pastor would like
[3837.72 --> 3839.14]  abuse the pulpit here
[3839.14 --> 3840.42]  to voice their own
[3840.42 --> 3841.52]  personal rebuke
[3841.52 --> 3843.64]  against certain individuals
[3843.64 --> 3844.34]  or groups.
[3845.64 --> 3847.06]  How do you think that went?
[3847.06 --> 3850.44]  That would lead to people
[3850.44 --> 3852.16]  shouting and screaming
[3852.16 --> 3852.90]  at the pastor
[3852.90 --> 3853.84]  even in the middle
[3853.84 --> 3854.34]  of a sermon.
[3855.72 --> 3857.28]  Don't get any ideas now.
[3857.54 --> 3858.32]  Like, I don't want to
[3858.32 --> 3859.52]  give you guys any ideas
[3859.52 --> 3860.60]  to try it out
[3860.60 --> 3861.58]  with Pastor Chris
[3861.58 --> 3862.42]  or Kevin or anything,
[3862.70 --> 3865.02]  but like think of
[3865.02 --> 3866.98]  and picture a heated debate
[3866.98 --> 3868.02]  in the House of Commons.
[3868.58 --> 3868.68]  Right?
[3868.72 --> 3869.56]  That's sort of the picture
[3869.56 --> 3870.68]  that I grew up with
[3870.68 --> 3872.36]  because the authority
[3872.36 --> 3873.02]  of the church
[3873.02 --> 3874.12]  or authority of a pastor
[3874.12 --> 3874.64]  or a leader
[3874.64 --> 3876.18]  has been abused.
[3877.06 --> 3878.20]  And I think we live
[3878.20 --> 3878.84]  in a generation
[3878.84 --> 3880.82]  that's kind of reacting
[3880.82 --> 3881.56]  against that.
[3883.10 --> 3885.80]  But that's exactly why
[3885.80 --> 3888.18]  Paul, from Jesus' teaching,
[3888.94 --> 3891.44]  says you have to confront
[3891.44 --> 3892.50]  a brother or sister
[3892.50 --> 3893.64]  with what?
[3894.62 --> 3895.96]  With gentleness,
[3896.44 --> 3898.14]  with a spirit of gentleness.
[3899.74 --> 3900.66]  He says,
[3900.94 --> 3902.38]  be careful in your rebuke
[3902.38 --> 3903.40]  of sins in the church
[3903.40 --> 3904.92]  for fellow brothers and sisters
[3904.92 --> 3907.12]  because in that rebuke,
[3907.42 --> 3909.02]  you also may be tempted
[3909.02 --> 3909.62]  to sin.
[3912.56 --> 3913.64]  Is it just me
[3913.64 --> 3914.78]  or do you relate
[3914.78 --> 3917.56]  that when you get angry,
[3917.94 --> 3919.34]  and sometimes rightly so,
[3919.84 --> 3921.10]  anger in itself
[3921.10 --> 3921.96]  is not a sin.
[3923.22 --> 3924.28]  There is such a thing
[3924.28 --> 3925.40]  called righteous anger.
[3925.74 --> 3927.04]  And against injustice
[3927.04 --> 3928.30]  and sin that is happening,
[3928.38 --> 3929.18]  we should be angry.
[3929.52 --> 3930.92]  We should share in God's heart
[3930.92 --> 3931.82]  and mourn
[3931.82 --> 3932.56]  and be angry
[3932.56 --> 3933.02]  and passionate
[3933.02 --> 3934.44]  against the sin
[3934.44 --> 3935.04]  and injustice
[3935.04 --> 3935.76]  and the brokenness
[3935.76 --> 3936.28]  of the world.
[3936.84 --> 3939.08]  But in that anger,
[3939.18 --> 3940.48]  it is so easy
[3940.48 --> 3941.46]  to go across
[3941.46 --> 3942.46]  that borderline
[3942.46 --> 3944.58]  and sin in that anger
[3944.58 --> 3945.06]  as well
[3945.06 --> 3946.14]  and say things
[3946.14 --> 3946.64]  that maybe
[3946.64 --> 3947.56]  we shouldn't have said.
[3948.74 --> 3949.90]  That's the warning
[3949.90 --> 3951.34]  that Jesus and Paul
[3951.34 --> 3952.44]  is teaching us with.
[3953.38 --> 3955.38]  In that confrontation,
[3956.04 --> 3956.92]  in that careful
[3957.50 --> 3959.14]  pointing out of sin,
[3959.14 --> 3960.58]  be careful
[3960.58 --> 3961.34]  because you might
[3961.34 --> 3962.34]  be tempted as well.
[3964.40 --> 3965.36]  This is what
[3965.36 --> 3967.10]  an early church father said
[3967.10 --> 3968.16]  on this point.
[3968.26 --> 3969.10]  He says it so well.
[3969.34 --> 3969.74]  He said,
[3970.68 --> 3971.24]  So then,
[3971.36 --> 3973.16]  be neither consenting
[3973.16 --> 3973.74]  to evil
[3973.74 --> 3975.28]  so as to approve it,
[3975.68 --> 3976.88]  nor negligent
[3976.88 --> 3978.74]  so as not to reprove it,
[3979.04 --> 3980.10]  nor proud
[3980.10 --> 3981.42]  so as to reprove it
[3981.42 --> 3982.92]  in a tone of insult.
[3984.84 --> 3986.30]  This we're talking like
[3986.30 --> 3987.22]  way back
[3987.22 --> 3988.30]  in early church days.
[3988.30 --> 3989.66]  Same struggle,
[3990.20 --> 3991.16]  same fight,
[3991.98 --> 3993.30]  same seeking forgiveness
[3993.30 --> 3994.14]  and living out
[3994.14 --> 3995.04]  this Christian identity
[3995.04 --> 3996.28]  of shalom
[3996.28 --> 3997.42]  and seeking reconciliation
[3997.42 --> 3999.74]  because this is hard work.
[4001.32 --> 4002.88]  It's much easier
[4002.88 --> 4004.08]  to avoid accountability
[4004.08 --> 4005.24]  and to avoid
[4005.24 --> 4006.46]  reproving somebody's
[4006.46 --> 4007.22]  unhealthy patterns.
[4007.70 --> 4008.62]  It's much easier
[4008.62 --> 4009.50]  to just let them be.
[4010.14 --> 4010.88]  That's your life.
[4011.68 --> 4012.40]  And think about it.
[4012.80 --> 4013.48]  Our culture
[4013.48 --> 4014.18]  that we live in,
[4014.36 --> 4016.46]  in a very hyper-individualistic culture,
[4016.46 --> 4018.20]  that's what's reflected anyways.
[4018.66 --> 4019.34]  You do you.
[4019.60 --> 4020.66]  You do whatever you want.
[4020.92 --> 4022.42]  Just follow your heart.
[4022.82 --> 4023.38]  Doesn't matter
[4023.38 --> 4026.58]  what the word of God says.
[4027.00 --> 4028.30]  Just you do you.
[4028.48 --> 4029.26]  That's fine.
[4030.40 --> 4031.34]  That's the culture
[4031.34 --> 4032.06]  we live in.
[4032.44 --> 4033.36]  That's why this is
[4033.36 --> 4034.50]  so much more difficult.
[4034.50 --> 4037.26]  You don't need me
[4037.26 --> 4038.28]  to point out your faults,
[4038.42 --> 4039.20]  speak into your life,
[4039.30 --> 4040.98]  journey toward growth together.
[4041.28 --> 4042.16]  That's the message
[4042.16 --> 4042.82]  of the culture.
[4043.10 --> 4043.74]  And we all say
[4043.74 --> 4044.98]  that's way too much work.
[4045.36 --> 4046.30]  Well, just pay the pastors
[4046.30 --> 4047.06]  to do that.
[4048.12 --> 4048.56]  Sure,
[4048.70 --> 4049.90]  it is the job of a pastor.
[4050.90 --> 4052.22]  But Paul and Jesus
[4052.22 --> 4053.00]  is not writing
[4053.00 --> 4053.90]  to one individual,
[4054.16 --> 4055.48]  one individual leader
[4055.48 --> 4056.12]  in the church.
[4056.24 --> 4056.84]  He's writing
[4056.84 --> 4057.96]  to the whole church
[4057.96 --> 4059.18]  as a body of believers.
[4059.68 --> 4060.42]  He, Paul says,
[4060.56 --> 4062.08]  carry each other's burdens,
[4062.08 --> 4063.00]  not pastor,
[4063.18 --> 4064.14]  carry everyone's burdens,
[4064.54 --> 4065.34]  point out their faults,
[4065.76 --> 4066.38]  journey with them
[4066.38 --> 4067.14]  toward growth.
[4067.62 --> 4069.94]  This is our identity together
[4069.94 --> 4071.32]  as Christians.
[4075.04 --> 4076.16]  Dale Bruner,
[4076.26 --> 4076.98]  a commentator,
[4077.34 --> 4077.78]  he says,
[4078.26 --> 4079.72]  real lovelessness,
[4080.38 --> 4081.14]  wrong judging,
[4081.58 --> 4082.30]  is to drop
[4082.30 --> 4083.46]  another person altogether
[4083.46 --> 4084.62]  without any attempt
[4084.62 --> 4085.98]  at seeking conversations,
[4086.32 --> 4086.68]  repentance,
[4086.84 --> 4088.04]  or reconciliation at all.
[4088.70 --> 4089.54]  But in Jesus'
[4089.78 --> 4091.36]  radical teaching of grace,
[4091.36 --> 4092.52]  the sinner
[4092.52 --> 4093.66]  is taken seriously
[4093.66 --> 4094.38]  as a person
[4094.38 --> 4095.10]  and is treated
[4095.10 --> 4096.46]  as the sequence shows
[4096.46 --> 4097.22]  in Matthew 18
[4097.22 --> 4098.56]  with an impressive
[4098.56 --> 4100.04]  carefulness.
[4102.02 --> 4103.24]  Because in this way,
[4103.38 --> 4103.90]  we embody
[4103.90 --> 4105.42]  a lifestyle of forgiveness,
[4105.80 --> 4106.54]  a way of life
[4106.54 --> 4107.62]  that is spirit-led.
[4108.10 --> 4108.78]  And when the church
[4108.78 --> 4110.06]  disciplines Christians,
[4110.54 --> 4111.42]  the church will be
[4111.42 --> 4112.42]  more effectively
[4112.42 --> 4113.86]  be able to disciple
[4113.86 --> 4115.10]  non-Christians.
[4115.54 --> 4116.34]  We are witnesses
[4116.34 --> 4117.40]  and a glimpse
[4117.40 --> 4118.52]  of God's kingdom
[4118.52 --> 4120.30]  seeking shalom
[4120.30 --> 4121.88]  through a humble,
[4122.12 --> 4123.00]  gentle posture
[4123.00 --> 4125.12]  of seeking that healing
[4125.12 --> 4125.68]  and forgiveness
[4125.68 --> 4126.96]  and bearing one another's
[4126.96 --> 4127.78]  burdens
[4127.78 --> 4129.74]  so that we may grow together.
[4130.18 --> 4131.64]  And so that is the invitation
[4131.64 --> 4132.50]  for us this morning
[4132.50 --> 4134.36]  and maybe for this summer season.
[4135.14 --> 4136.30]  Who is someone
[4136.30 --> 4137.96]  you care enough about
[4137.96 --> 4139.62]  to hold accountable,
[4140.40 --> 4141.92]  to name and seek
[4141.92 --> 4143.12]  reconciliation with?
[4143.12 --> 4145.34]  Who comes to mind
[4145.34 --> 4145.74]  for you
[4145.74 --> 4146.40]  when this question
[4146.40 --> 4146.92]  is asked?
[4148.58 --> 4149.52]  And the warning again
[4149.52 --> 4150.90]  is to be careful
[4150.90 --> 4151.60]  not to sin
[4151.60 --> 4152.76]  and fall into temptation,
[4153.24 --> 4154.54]  to just hold a grudge
[4154.54 --> 4155.78]  or gossip about them.
[4156.72 --> 4157.22]  Instead,
[4157.60 --> 4158.62]  one step at a time,
[4159.12 --> 4159.80]  can you just go
[4159.80 --> 4160.82]  grab a coffee with them?
[4162.72 --> 4164.08]  Because the good news,
[4164.20 --> 4164.46]  again,
[4164.58 --> 4165.56]  is that the foundation
[4165.56 --> 4167.08]  of where we lean on
[4167.08 --> 4168.32]  is that we journey
[4168.32 --> 4169.44]  through all of this
[4169.44 --> 4170.20]  hard work
[4170.20 --> 4171.30]  of seeking reconciliation
[4171.30 --> 4173.46]  with the ultimate hope
[4173.46 --> 4174.40]  in the forgiver
[4174.40 --> 4175.78]  of all of our sins.
[4176.12 --> 4176.90]  That's where
[4176.90 --> 4178.24]  our foundation lies.
[4180.28 --> 4180.64]  Jesus,
[4181.02 --> 4181.94]  He is the one
[4181.94 --> 4182.92]  who is with us,
[4183.28 --> 4184.54]  dwells within us,
[4184.60 --> 4185.58]  and empowers us
[4185.58 --> 4186.28]  through His Spirit
[4186.28 --> 4188.32]  to take those difficult steps
[4188.32 --> 4189.96]  to live out our faith.
[4192.96 --> 4194.28]  That is our calling.
[4195.42 --> 4197.20]  That is our identity.
[4198.22 --> 4199.38]  And it is a privilege
[4199.38 --> 4200.72]  to live that out together
[4200.72 --> 4202.38]  as the body of Christ here.
[4203.08 --> 4204.00]  This is my blessing
[4204.00 --> 4205.14]  for Emmanuel
[4205.14 --> 4205.88]  as we enter
[4205.88 --> 4207.06]  into these summer months
[4207.06 --> 4209.30]  to seek shalom,
[4209.88 --> 4211.74]  to reflect God's kingdom
[4211.74 --> 4212.50]  here on earth.
[4213.58 --> 4214.30]  Let's pray.
[4221.38 --> 4222.12]  Father God,
[4222.18 --> 4222.94]  we come before you
[4222.94 --> 4223.52]  this morning
[4223.52 --> 4225.48]  in gratitude.
[4225.48 --> 4228.06]  we thank you
[4228.06 --> 4229.64]  for your forgiving heart
[4229.64 --> 4231.70]  that although
[4231.70 --> 4233.06]  we all fall short,
[4233.90 --> 4235.30]  through your grace,
[4235.50 --> 4236.70]  we may approach
[4236.70 --> 4237.82]  your throne of grace,
[4238.64 --> 4240.44]  that we are saved
[4240.44 --> 4241.80]  through your grace.
[4243.12 --> 4244.06]  We thank you
[4244.06 --> 4245.06]  for this good news.
[4245.42 --> 4246.14]  We thank you
[4246.14 --> 4247.04]  for granting us
[4247.04 --> 4247.66]  that forgiveness.
[4248.24 --> 4248.70]  And Lord,
[4249.02 --> 4250.18]  we pray that you
[4250.18 --> 4250.98]  would guide us
[4250.98 --> 4253.20]  and you would empower us
[4253.20 --> 4254.82]  to do this hard work
[4254.82 --> 4255.46]  of reflecting
[4255.46 --> 4257.38]  our Christian identities
[4257.38 --> 4258.48]  to forgive
[4258.48 --> 4259.22]  as those
[4259.22 --> 4260.10]  who have been forgiven.
[4261.46 --> 4262.62]  I pray for
[4262.62 --> 4263.60]  our relationships,
[4264.44 --> 4265.26]  relationships
[4265.26 --> 4266.38]  with one another
[4266.38 --> 4267.32]  within the church,
[4267.84 --> 4268.82]  relationship with you,
[4269.60 --> 4270.42]  relationship with
[4270.42 --> 4271.32]  ourselves,
[4271.94 --> 4273.92]  that we may be able
[4273.92 --> 4274.44]  to forgive
[4274.44 --> 4275.70]  and seek reconciliation
[4275.70 --> 4276.64]  and shalom.
[4278.06 --> 4278.28]  Lord,
[4278.32 --> 4278.74]  guide us
[4278.74 --> 4279.54]  through your spirit
[4279.54 --> 4281.04]  that we may glimpse
[4281.04 --> 4281.72]  a little bit
[4281.72 --> 4282.64]  of what your kingdom
[4282.64 --> 4283.18]  is like
[4283.18 --> 4284.40]  here on earth
[4284.40 --> 4285.20]  as it is in heaven.
[4286.24 --> 4287.48]  May we be empowered
[4287.48 --> 4288.36]  to be witnesses
[4288.36 --> 4290.00]  for those around us,
[4290.12 --> 4291.04]  for our communities,
[4292.04 --> 4294.08]  that we may be light
[4294.08 --> 4295.64]  that shines brightly
[4295.64 --> 4296.26]  in the darkness,
[4296.90 --> 4297.84]  that we may reflect
[4297.84 --> 4299.42]  your loving goodness
[4299.42 --> 4300.00]  for the world.
[4301.30 --> 4301.86]  We thank you
[4301.86 --> 4302.78]  for this good news
[4302.78 --> 4303.60]  and in Jesus' name
[4303.60 --> 4303.98]  we pray.
[4304.98 --> 4305.28]  Amen.
[4309.54 --> 4328.58]  Great is your faithfulness,
[4328.58 --> 4329.80]  O God.
[4332.74 --> 4337.08]  You wrestle with the sinner's
[4337.08 --> 4338.74]  restless heart.
[4338.74 --> 4344.56]  beauty as my still water
[4344.56 --> 4346.74]  brings into mercy
[4346.74 --> 4353.70]  when nothing can keep us apart.
[4355.76 --> 4359.82]  So remember your people,
[4359.82 --> 4363.72]  remember your children,
[4363.72 --> 4367.94]  remember your promise,
[4368.18 --> 4369.54]  O God.
[4371.54 --> 4374.72]  Your grace is enough,
[4374.72 --> 4378.72]  Your grace is enough,
[4378.72 --> 4384.72]  Your grace is enough for me.
[4384.72 --> 4391.72]  You lead us in the song of your salvation,
[4391.72 --> 4398.62]  You lead us in the song of your salvation,
[4398.62 --> 4400.30]  the strong
[4400.30 --> 4406.52]  You lead us in the song
[4406.52 --> 4408.54]  of your salvation
[4408.54 --> 4413.38]  And all your people
[4413.38 --> 4415.60]  sing along
[4415.60 --> 4419.46]  So remember
[4419.46 --> 4421.46]  your people
[4421.46 --> 4425.38]  Remember your children
[4425.38 --> 4429.52]  Remember your promise
[4429.52 --> 4431.14]  O God
[4431.14 --> 4436.68]  Your grace is enough
[4436.68 --> 4440.46]  Your grace is enough
[4440.46 --> 4444.22]  Your grace is enough
[4444.22 --> 4446.40]  for me
[4446.40 --> 4451.92]  Your grace is enough
[4451.92 --> 4455.76]  Heaven reaches out to us
[4455.76 --> 4459.46]  Your grace is enough
[4459.46 --> 4461.62]  for me
[4461.62 --> 4467.04]  Your grace is enough
[4467.04 --> 4470.82]  I'm covering your love
[4470.82 --> 4474.62]  Your grace is enough
[4474.62 --> 4476.84]  for me
[4476.84 --> 4493.00]  Amen
[4493.00 --> 4496.90]  So receive this parting blessing
[4496.90 --> 4500.28]  May the grace of the Lord
[4500.28 --> 4501.26]  Jesus Christ
[4501.26 --> 4502.76]  and the love of God
[4502.76 --> 4503.70]  and the fellowship
[4503.70 --> 4504.78]  of the Holy Spirit
[4504.78 --> 4506.04]  be with you all
[4506.04 --> 4506.90]  as we continue
[4506.90 --> 4507.68]  to live out
[4507.68 --> 4508.40]  our identity
[4508.40 --> 4510.02]  as people of God
[4510.02 --> 4511.86]  people who seek shalom
[4511.86 --> 4513.50]  All God's people said
[4513.50 --> 4514.82]  Amen
[4514.82 --> 4534.40]  As you go
[4534.40 --> 4535.28]  may you know
[4535.28 --> 4536.58]  the love of Christ
[4536.58 --> 4538.72]  How do you walk
[4538.72 --> 4540.70]  how high and wide
[4540.70 --> 4543.02]  As you need
[4543.02 --> 4543.84]  may you see
[4543.84 --> 4545.14]  in Christ
[4545.14 --> 4547.30]  And find His death
[4547.30 --> 4550.00]  to be your life
[4550.00 --> 4551.62]  May you go
[4551.62 --> 4552.70]  in the love
[4552.70 --> 4554.46]  of your Father God
[4554.46 --> 4555.82]  May you go

[4594.70 --> 4596.52]  of the Spirit now
[4596.52 --> 4598.08]  To bring you glory
[4598.08 --> 4600.10]  with your love
[4600.10 --> 4602.00]  As you go
[4602.00 --> 4602.86]  may you show
[4602.86 --> 4604.10]  His heart to bless
[4604.10 --> 4606.34]  No one to bless
[4606.34 --> 4608.24]  with blind and lost
[4608.24 --> 4610.42]  As you need
[4610.42 --> 4611.18]  may you be
[4611.18 --> 4612.44]  in the light of Christ
[4612.44 --> 4614.66]  And show our hope
[4614.66 --> 4617.64]  is in the cross
[4617.64 --> 4618.82]  May you go
[4618.82 --> 4619.82]  in love

[4641.46 --> 4643.72]  May you go
[4643.72 --> 4672.94]  May you go
[4673.72 --> 4703.70]  Thank you.
[4703.72 --> 4733.70]  Thank you.
[4733.72 --> 4763.70]  Thank you.
[4763.72 --> 4793.70]  Thank you.
