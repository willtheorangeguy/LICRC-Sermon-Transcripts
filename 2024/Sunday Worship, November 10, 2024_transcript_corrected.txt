[1572.56 → 1577.80] I invite you to be seated.
[1582.84 → 1585.50] We're going to spend some time in our prayer of confession right now.
[1585.60 → 1591.38] I'll lead you in a prayer and then invite you to pray in silence afterwards as we confess to our God.
[1591.48 → 1591.84] Let's pray.
[1594.48 → 1602.10] Heavenly Father, we know that nothing is able to separate us from your love because of Jesus Christ.
[1602.56 → 1610.62] In our time of silence now, Lord, let us, in that freedom, confess the wrong that we have done.
[1632.56 → 1634.56] Amen.

[1661.48 → 1669.48] Be still for the presence of the Lord,
[1669.48 → 1677.48] the Holy One is here.
[1677.48 → 1683.48] Come now before Him now,
[1683.48 → 1691.48] with reverence and fear.
[1691.48 → 1697.48] In Him no sin is found,
[1697.48 → 1705.48] we stand on holy ground.
[1705.48 → 1711.48] Be still for the presence of the Lord,
[1711.48 → 1717.48] the Holy One is here.
[1717.48 → 1721.48] I invite you to stand for the singing of the next two verses.
[1721.48 → 1727.48] Be still for the glory of the Lord,
[1727.48 → 1733.48] is shining all around.
[1733.48 → 1741.48] He burns with holy fire,
[1741.48 → 1749.48] with splendour He is proud.

[1755.48 → 1761.48] our radiant King of light.
[1761.48 → 1767.48] Be still for the glory of the Lord,
[1767.48 → 1773.48] is shining all around.
[1773.48 → 1781.48] Be still for the power of the Lord,
[1781.48 → 1787.48] is moving in this place.
[1787.48 → 1795.48] He comes to cleanse and heal,
[1795.48 → 1801.48] to minister His praise.
[1801.48 → 1803.48] No work too hard for Him,
[1803.48 → 1807.48] no work too hard for Him,
[1807.48 → 1813.48] in faith receive from Him.
[1813.48 → 1817.48] Be still for the power of the Lord,

[1847.48 → 1849.48] Amen.
[1849.48 → 1850.48] We do not know the Lord,
[1850.48 → 1851.48] we do not know the Lord,
[1851.48 → 1853.48] we do not know the Lord,
[1853.48 → 1854.48] and we do not know the Lord,
[1854.48 → 1855.48] we do not know the Lord,
[1855.48 → 1856.48] we do not know the Lord,
[1856.48 → 1858.48] we do not know the Lord.
[1858.48 → 1860.48] See it there,
[1860.48 → 1864.48] the great I am,
[1864.48 → 1869.48] a crown of those upon His head.
[1869.48 → 1879.14] On his head, the Father's heart displayed for us.
[1879.14 → 1886.14] Oh God, we thank you for the cross.
[1889.50 → 1899.42] Lifted on Calvary's hill, we curse your name.
[1899.48 → 1909.52] And even still, you bore our shame and paid the cost.
[1910.18 → 1915.48] Oh God, we thank you for the cross.
[1915.48 → 1929.48] Behold the Lamb, the story of redemption written on his hands.
[1929.48 → 1934.48] Jesus, you will reign forevermore.
[1935.48 → 1939.48] The victory is yours.
[1939.48 → 1943.86] We sing your praise.
[1944.38 → 1949.48] Endless hallelujahs to your holy name.
[1950.48 → 1954.48] Jesus, you will reign forevermore.
[1955.48 → 1958.48] The victory is yours.
[1958.48 → 1960.48] Lord God, we thank you for the cross.

[1963.48 → 1964.48] Amen.
[1964.48 → 1965.48] Amen.
[1965.48 → 1971.90] This sacrifice for every sin
[1971.90 → 1978.40] Our Saviour died, the Lord of life
[1978.40 → 1982.30] Can be contained
[1982.30 → 1988.58] Our love has risen from the grave
[1988.58 → 1994.66] Our love has risen from the grave
[1994.66 → 1999.04] He pulled the Lamb
[1999.04 → 2005.60] The story of redemption written on His hand
[2005.60 → 2009.66] Jesus, You will reign forevermore

[2049.66 → 2050.04] Bright as the sun
[2050.04 → 2052.66] We'll bow before
[2052.66 → 2056.66] The King of kings
[2056.66 → 2063.66] O God, forever we will sing
[2063.66 → 2071.66] Behold the Lamb
[2071.66 → 2078.54] The story of redemption written on His hands
[2078.54 → 2083.54] Jesus, You will reign forevermore
[2083.54 → 2087.54] The victory is yours
[2087.54 → 2090.54] Behold the Lamb
[2090.54 → 2097.54] The story of redemption written on His hands

[2138.54 → 2139.54] Jesus, You will reign forevermore
[2139.54 → 2148.54] Jesus, You will reign forevermore
[2148.54 → 2152.54] Jesus, You will reign forevermore
[2152.54 → 2166.52] Good morning. My name is Pearl. I'm a deacon here at Langley Emanuel. We continue our worship
[2166.52 → 2171.42] by giving our offering, and today's offering is both for the budget, which is the ministries
[2171.42 → 2177.92] of this church, and for Seeds of Hope. Seeds of Hope is a ministry that was founded around
[2177.92 → 2186.66] 1995 out of Chilliwack, BC, and it's a place that ministers to kids who have become orphans
[2186.66 → 2192.52] due to AIDS. They have been traumatized. They've lost both parents. Many of them themselves
[2192.52 → 2201.80] are HIV positive, and currently the Seed of Hope ministry works mostly out of Zambia in
[2201.80 → 2208.64] Africa, and there they have a children's home as well as a Grace Christian Academy, which
[2208.64 → 2214.24] is a school where these kids can go to. So these kids receive all kinds of love and support,
[2214.24 → 2219.52] trauma support. They also receive perfect antiviral medications, so many of them, their
[2219.52 → 2226.48] viral load is quite low, so they live quite normal lives, and there they also receive the
[2226.48 → 2231.94] love of Jesus, they get an education, and then many of them, through all of that, even though
[2231.94 → 2239.24] they have been so highly traumatized, go on to lead productive lives and return as leaders
[2239.24 → 2246.54] back into their country. So Seed of Hope is a very powerfully profound ministry, and do give generously.
[2256.48 → 2286.46] Lord, I come to you. Let my heart be changed, renewed, flowing from the
[2286.46 → 2305.46] from the grace that I've found in you. And Lord, I've come to know the weaknesses I see
[2305.46 → 2335.44] in me. We'll be stripped away by the power of your love. Hold me close, let your love surround me.
[2335.44 → 2362.44] Take me near, draw me to your side. And as I wake, I'll rise up like the eagle, and I will soar with you. Your spirit leads me on.
[2362.44 → 2392.42] Lord, unveil my eyes. Let me see you face to face the knowledge of your love as you live in me.
[2392.42 → 2416.42] Lord, you knew my mind. You knew my mind. As you will unfold in my life. In living every day. By the power of your love.
[2416.42 → 2439.42] hold me close, let your love surround me. Bring me near, draw me to your side.
[2439.42 → 2446.42] And as I wake, I'll rise up like the eagle, and I will soar with you. Your spirit leads me on. In the power of your love.
[2446.42 → 2448.42] And I will soar with you. Your spirit leads me on. In the power of your love.
[2448.42 → 2453.42] And I will soar with you. Your spirit leads me on. In the power of your love.
[2453.42 → 2460.42] And I will soar with you. Your spirit leads me on. In the power of your love.
[2460.42 → 2472.42] And I will soar with you. Your spirit leads me on. In the power of your love.
[2472.42 → 2479.42] Your spirit leads me on. In the power of your love. In the power of your love.
[2479.42 → 2488.26] Good morning. I'm going to invite all the preschool to grade four kids to join me up front for a kids' corner before we head off to children's worship time.
[2488.26 → 2500.26] So come on up. Find a spot here. Oh, hi. You're just right there. It's been a while. I haven't seen all you guys in a few months.
[2500.26 → 2508.26] I think there are some faces I need to learn some names for yet. Hey, I have to show you guys something. I'm going to ask my assistant to come on up.
[2508.26 → 2519.26] And we're going to see if this works out for us. Do you guys perhaps know what this contraption could be? What do you think, Malachi?
[2521.26 → 2529.26] A tin can telephone. I'm amazed you knew what that was. It's like how phones used to work in the olden days when there's a cord between them.
[2529.26 → 2536.26] I know. We've done this before. And I think some of us have not tried this before. So we're going to see if it's going to work.
[2536.26 → 2541.26] Have you guys used a tin can telephone before? Yeah? Yeah? Oh, so you guys probably know better than I do.
[2541.26 → 2547.26] Well, me and Rio tried this the other day and it worked then. Yeah, we've got to pull it tight.
[2547.26 → 2553.26] So we're going to need one brave person to help us out. Sharon Malachi, how don't you help us out? And Joel, why don't you help us out?
[2553.26 → 2563.26] And we're going to give one end of this tin can telephone to Rio. And she's, it's pretty long. I went a little, I went a little assertive with this length.
[2563.26 → 2570.26] You might want to go down the hall there with one end. And Malachi, do you want to go with Rio?
[2570.26 → 2577.26] Okay. And Joel's going to stay with me here. We're going to see if this thing works. Right.
[2577.26 → 2584.26] Don't worry, guys. I think we'll all get a turn at children's worship time. Oh, boy, we're going to go a little faster than this.
[2586.26 → 2592.26] There we go. Keep it going. Is he getting stuck? Rio, do you want to give him a hand?
[2592.26 → 2605.26] Okay. So while they're figuring that out, Joel, what is the message? We're going to send down the telephone to Rio and Malachi.
[2605.26 → 2615.26] Okay. We'll let these guys get set up.
[2615.26 → 2621.26] So what are some tips, those of you that have done this before?
[2621.26 → 2628.26] You got to keep it really tight, right? Haley? Yeah. Yeah. Those of us that have, oh, okay. You're ready to go?
[2628.26 → 2635.26] Okay. So Joel is going to say a message. You're going to stick your, that phone right up to your ear. We'll pull it nice and tight.
[2635.26 → 2637.26] You can say it, Joel. Yeah.
[2637.26 → 2645.26] Do I say prayer? No, don't say it too loud. Say it right. Okay. Prayer needs prayer. Prayer is powerful. Prayer is powerful.
[2645.26 → 2650.26] Did you hear anything?
[2650.26 → 2659.26] Well, the batteries might be dead. Wait. You got to say it a little louder.
[2659.26 → 2663.26] Prayer is powerful.
[2663.26 → 2666.26] Do you hear that?
[2666.26 → 2671.26] Oh, yeah. We'll go one more shot. Prayer is powerful.
[2671.26 → 2673.26] Yes.
[2673.26 → 2679.26] I can hear you, Malachi. And not because you're in the room.
[2679.26 → 2683.26] Okay. We're going to play with this some more in children's worship time.
[2683.26 → 2686.26] But the message Joel was saying was what?
[2686.26 → 2688.26] Prayer is powerful. Prayer is powerful.
[2688.26 → 2695.26] And this is our little illustration today for how, with prayer, we have a direct line to God.
[2695.26 → 2698.26] And that is incredible.
[2698.26 → 2702.26] God who created the earth, everything, all of us, who loves us deeply,
[2702.26 → 2707.26] we can all talk to him whenever we want, and he listens.
[2707.26 → 2711.26] So Rio is going to get the telephone together for me.
[2711.26 → 2714.26] And we're going to stand together and do the children's blessing.
[2714.26 → 2718.26] We'll bless the congregation before, as they get ready to listen to a message,
[2718.26 → 2724.26] and they will bless us in return as we go off to learn a little bit more about prayer in children's worship time.
[2724.26 → 2729.26] Alright, arms together.
[2729.26 → 2731.26] The Lord be with you.
[2731.26 → 2733.26] And also with you.
[2733.26 → 2734.26] Okay.
[2754.26 → 2762.26] My name is Clary, and I'm an elder here.
[2762.26 → 2773.26] And I just want to share with you topics that we went over at our council meeting, our full council meeting, this past Tuesday evening, November the 5th.
[2773.26 → 2778.26] There's just five items to share with you, and I think these are also in the online bulletin.
[2778.26 → 2787.26] First, council reviewed the proposed 2025 ministry and mission budget with the finance committee,
[2787.26 → 2793.26] and recommended it for presentation at the fall general meeting.
[2793.26 → 2799.26] We also reviewed and approved the agenda for the fall general meeting.
[2799.26 → 2804.26] We heard updates from pastors Chris and Kevin.
[2804.26 → 2809.26] We received an update from those who attended the classes meeting recently.
[2809.26 → 2818.26] And we reviewed and approved the list of vulnerable sector volunteers.
[2818.26 → 2819.26] Thank you.
[2829.26 → 2830.26] Thanks, Clary.
[2830.26 → 2831.26] Sorry for the confusion.
[2831.26 → 2832.26] That's on me.
[2832.26 → 2839.26] I'm filling in for the pastoral elder who was to lead our church family prayer this morning.
[2839.26 → 2842.26] And so I'm going to lead us in a time of prayer together.
[2842.26 → 2848.26] Before we pray, some of you have already heard, but we're going to pray for Mary Fritz,
[2848.26 → 2853.26] who recently fell and broke her hip, required surgery.
[2853.26 → 2858.26] She's doing well and is recovering and is grateful to God for that.
[2858.26 → 2863.26] So we're going to continue to pray for her and pray for God's healing in her life.
[2863.26 → 2864.26] Let's pray together.
[2864.26 → 2865.26] Let's pray together.
[2865.26 → 2866.26] Let's pray together.
[2866.26 → 2867.26] Let's pray together.
[2867.26 → 2868.26] Let's pray together.
[2868.26 → 2869.26] Let's pray together.
[2869.26 → 2873.26] Holy God and Heavenly Father, we gather here as your church to worship your name.
[2873.26 → 2883.26] We gather here because you have called us to this place, and you are now carrying us to your presence.
[2883.26 → 2888.26] Father God, we know that by your spirit, you are present among us.
[2888.26 → 2899.26] And so as your church called, as your church set apart for your purposes, we ask that you would accomplish your will among us.
[2899.26 → 2910.26] Father God, as we gather today, we do so mindful of the psalmist and joining our hearts with him as he prayed,
[2910.26 → 2916.26] I call on the Lord in my distress, and he answers me.
[2916.26 → 2922.26] And so, Lord, in our distress, we call on you waiting for your answer.
[2922.26 → 2941.26] Father God, we pray for those in our congregation, church family, for those whom we know and love, who are unwell, who are in the midst of treatment for long-term or recent illness discoveries in their life.
[2941.26 → 2946.26] God, we pray for those who have recently had surgery.
[2946.26 → 2949.26] We give you thanks for the success of those surgeries.
[2949.26 → 2953.26] And we pray also, God, for those who are waiting for treatment.
[2954.26 → 2961.26] We ask that in the midst of the waiting, that you would give them a peace that passes all understanding.
[2962.26 → 2968.26] That you would give them patience that relies on your presence and your nearness.
[2968.26 → 2976.26] Father God, we pray for Mary, asking that you would continue to be with her.
[2976.26 → 2981.26] We thank you for your presence with her through the surgery and now into recovery.
[2981.26 → 2987.26] And we ask that you would grant her all that she needs, that she can be restored to a full measure of health.
[2987.26 → 2999.26] Father, we know that there are those among us who are struggling with illnesses that they have not yet shared.
[2999.26 → 3008.26] Father, whether they are physical or emotional or issues of mental health, we pray, Lord God, that you would draw near.
[3009.26 → 3014.26] And that you would raise us up as your body to care for one another.
[3014.26 → 3021.26] And that we, together, might be a means of your presence in the lives of those in need.
[3025.26 → 3030.26] God, as we pray, we pray in the truth of the psalmist who says,
[3030.26 → 3032.26] My times are in your hands.
[3032.26 → 3039.26] And we think about those, Lord God, who require you to work in their lives.
[3039.26 → 3046.26] God, I pray especially this morning for those who are in the midst of systems of care.
[3046.26 → 3053.26] For those who are in the midst of fostering or adoption or poverty resources or housing issues.
[3053.26 → 3061.26] God, we pray that each one would know that our times are in your hands.
[3061.26 → 3065.26] And so, God, we know that there are delays.
[3065.26 → 3066.26] And there's often long waiting.
[3066.26 → 3070.26] We know that there are often more questions than there are answers.
[3070.26 → 3076.26] And so we pray, with our times in your hands, help us to endure.
[3078.26 → 3084.26] And we pray, God, for those who need you to bring resolution to a tough case.
[3084.26 → 3087.26] Who need you to bring an answer to a hard problem.
[3087.26 → 3094.26] Would you move in these systems and outside of them, Lord God, to bring the care that is needed.
[3098.26 → 3102.26] Father God, we know that every good and perfect gift is from above.
[3102.26 → 3110.26] And so we thank you for the good gifts of leaders and of volunteers in this congregation.
[3110.26 → 3120.26] We thank you for the meeting of council that took place and the vision that is being cast for ministry and mission year 2025 in the proposed budget.
[3120.26 → 3127.26] We thank you for the faithfulness of this congregation in supporting the ministries of this church this past year.
[3127.26 → 3136.26] As we finish the year together, God, I pray that you would allow us the opportunity to increase our faithfulness.
[3136.26 → 3142.26] And so allow us to finish the year well and strong in a financial position.
[3142.26 → 3146.26] But also, God, excited and moved by what you are doing among us.
[3146.26 → 3150.26] And crying out that you would do another work among us.
[3150.26 → 3152.26] That you would do a new thing among us.
[3152.26 → 3155.26] That you would take us with confidence into the future.
[3155.26 → 3161.26] Father, we thank you for the many people who serve in different capacities.
[3161.26 → 3169.26] And we pray that having spoken the need this morning for children's worship time volunteers and helpers,
[3169.26 → 3172.26] that you would stir in hearts to fill that responsibility.
[3172.26 → 3178.26] God, I bless you for a church family that loves to serve.
[3179.26 → 3182.26] And that longs to work for your kingdom.
[3182.26 → 3186.26] We celebrate the way we see that in our midst together.
[3186.26 → 3197.26] Father God, as well, we pray in the confidence of the prophet Isaiah who spoke your word to us saying,
[3197.26 → 3198.26] I will sustain you.
[3198.26 → 3199.26] I have made you.
[3199.26 → 3200.26] I will carry you.
[3200.26 → 3203.26] I will sustain you and rescue you.
[3203.26 → 3208.26] God, on this Remembrance Day weekend,
[3208.26 → 3214.26] we are mindful of your eternal plan of rescuing and salvation.
[3214.26 → 3220.26] And we are mindful of those whom you have called to rescue nations,
[3220.26 → 3222.26] to rescue war-torn countries,
[3222.26 → 3231.26] those whom you have called to bring hope where there is none in terms of war and the strife that that can bring.
[3231.26 → 3239.26] And so, God, we thank you for the men and women who have served the cause of peace around the world.
[3239.26 → 3247.26] And we pray that you would move in us now to be agents of peace, ambassadors of reconciliation,
[3247.26 → 3251.26] spurred by their stories and their memory.
[3251.26 → 3253.26] May we seek the same.
[3253.26 → 3258.26] God, we know that there are still wars ongoing, and so we pray for peace.
[3258.26 → 3263.26] We know that there is escalation in those wars, and so we pray for an end.
[3263.26 → 3271.26] And God, we pray that until that great day of your return,
[3271.26 → 3274.26] we would fix our eyes on you,
[3274.26 → 3280.26] looking to you for our only full source of hope and peace.
[3280.26 → 3285.26] And God, as we fix our eyes on you, we turn now to your word.
[3285.26 → 3291.26] Jesus, you have said to us, and we have heard that you have the words of eternal life,
[3291.26 → 3297.26] and so speak words of life to us this morning as we open your word.
[3297.26 → 3300.26] In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[3300.26 → 3318.26] We're going to continue in our look at the story of Joseph.
[3318.26 → 3327.26] Jumping ahead a little bit to Joseph and his story as it comes to us in Genesis 41,
[3327.26 → 3331.26] we're going to read the first 40 verses of this story,
[3331.26 → 3334.26] just so we can kind of get the whole narrative in our mind.
[3334.26 → 3338.26] And it will be on the screen behind me as we go through it the first time.
[3338.26 → 3344.26] But of course, I encourage you to have your Bibles open in front of you or on in front of you,
[3344.26 → 3349.26] and a notebook if you have it, as we go through God's word together.
[3349.26 → 3354.26] Let's pick up the story of Joseph.
[3354.26 → 3360.26] When two full years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream.
[3360.26 → 3367.26] He was standing by the Nile when out of the river there came up seven cows, sleek and fat,
[3367.26 → 3369.26] and they grazed among the reeds.
[3369.26 → 3374.26] After them, seven other cows, ugly and gaunt, came up out of the Nile
[3374.26 → 3376.26] and stood beside those on the riverbank.
[3376.26 → 3381.26] And the cows that were ugly and gaunt ate up the seven sleek, fat cows.
[3381.26 → 3384.26] Then Pharaoh woke up.
[3384.26 → 3387.26] He fell asleep again and had a second dream.
[3387.26 → 3392.26] Seven heads of grain, healthy and good, were growing on a single stalk.
[3392.26 → 3399.26] After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted, thin and scorched by the east wind.
[3399.26 → 3404.26] The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy, full heads.
[3404.26 → 3406.26] Then Pharaoh woke up.
[3406.26 → 3409.26] It had been a dream.
[3409.26 → 3414.26] In the morning his mind was troubled, and so he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt.
[3414.26 → 3418.26] Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them.
[3418.26 → 3420.26] Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh,
[3420.26 → 3424.26] Today I am reminded of my shortcomings.
[3424.26 → 3431.26] Pharaoh was once angry with his servants, and he imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard.
[3431.26 → 3436.26] Each of us had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own.
[3436.26 → 3441.26] Now a young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard.
[3441.26 → 3447.26] We told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us, giving each man the interpretation of his dream.
[3447.26 → 3452.26] And the things turned out exactly as he had interpreted them to us.
[3452.26 → 3459.26] I was restored to my position, and the other man was imprisoned, or was impaled.
[3459.26 → 3464.26] So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was quickly brought before the dungeon.
[3464.26 → 3469.26] When he had shaved and changed his clothes, he came before Pharaoh.
[3469.26 → 3471.26] Pharaoh said to Joseph,
[3471.26 → 3479.26] I had a dream, and no one can interpret it, but I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream, you can interpret it.
[3479.26 → 3484.26] I cannot do it, Joseph replied to Pharaoh.
[3484.26 → 3489.26] But God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires.
[3489.26 → 3492.26] Then Pharaoh said to Joseph,
[3492.26 → 3498.26] In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile, when out of the river there came up seven cows, fat and sleek,
[3498.26 → 3500.26] and they grazed among the reeds.
[3500.26 → 3504.26] After them seven other cows came up, scrawny and very ugly and lean.
[3504.26 → 3508.26] I had never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt.
[3508.26 → 3513.26] The lean and ugly cows ate up the seven fat cows that came first.
[3513.26 → 3517.26] But even after they ate them, no one could tell that they had done so.
[3517.26 → 3520.26] They looked just as ugly as before.
[3520.26 → 3522.26] And then I woke up.
[3522.26 → 3528.26] In my dream I saw seven heads of grain, full and good, growing on a single stalk.
[3528.26 → 3534.26] After them seven other heads sprouted, withered and thin and scorched by the east wind.
[3534.26 → 3538.26] The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads.
[3538.26 → 3542.26] I told this to the magicians, but none of them could explain it to me.
[3542.26 → 3546.26] Then Joseph said to Pharaoh,
[3546.26 → 3550.26] The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same.
[3550.26 → 3554.26] God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
[3554.26 → 3557.26] The seven good cows are seven years.
[3557.26 → 3559.26] The seven good heads of grain are seven years.
[3559.26 → 3562.26] And it is one and the same dream.
[3562.26 → 3566.26] The seven lean, ugly cows that came up afterwards are seven years.
[3566.26 → 3571.26] And so the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind.
[3571.26 → 3573.26] They are seven years of famine.
[3573.26 → 3576.26] It is just as I said to Pharaoh.
[3576.26 → 3580.26] God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
[3580.26 → 3585.26] Seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt.
[3585.26 → 3587.26] But seven years of famine will follow them.
[3587.26 → 3590.26] Then all the abundance in Egypt will be forgotten.
[3590.26 → 3593.26] The famine will ravage the land.
[3593.26 → 3599.26] The abundance in the land will not be remembered because the famine that follows it will be so severe.
[3599.26 → 3609.26] The reason the dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms is that the matter has been firmly decided by God and God will do it soon.
[3609.26 → 3615.26] And now let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and put him in charge of the land of Egypt.
[3615.26 → 3622.26] Let Pharaoh appoint commissioners over the land to take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven years of abundance.
[3622.26 → 3631.26] They should collect all the food of these good years that are coming and store up the grain under the authority of Pharaoh to be kept in the cities for food.
[3631.26 → 3641.26] This food should be held in reserve for the country to be used during the seven years of famine that will come upon Egypt so that the country may not be ruined by the famine.
[3641.26 → 3645.26] The plan seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his officials.
[3645.26 → 3653.26] And so Pharaoh asked them, can we find anyone like this man, one in whom is the spirit of God?
[3653.26 → 3663.26] Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, since God has made all this known to you, there is no one so discerning and wise as you.
[3663.26 → 3670.26] You shall be in charge of my palace and of all my people and all my people are to submit to your orders.
[3670.26 → 3675.26] Only with respect to the throne will I be greater than you.
[3675.26 → 3677.26] This is the word of the Lord.
[3677.26 → 3693.26] I want to draw your attention as your Bibles are still open to verse 16, where Joseph says, I cannot do it, but God will.
[3693.26 → 3700.26] Hold on to that phrase as we go through our time this morning.
[3700.26 → 3707.26] Now I mentioned before that we're in the life and the story of Joseph right now here at Emmanuel.
[3707.26 → 3717.26] And in that we have been looking very particularly at ways to lean on God in our suffering.
[3717.26 → 3730.26] We've called these ideas God hints as their ways of seeing God and experiencing God even in the darkest moments of our lives.
[3730.26 → 3737.26] Because of course, I don't have to tell any of you that part of the shared human experience is pain.
[3737.26 → 3739.26] It's hardship.
[3739.26 → 3741.26] It's trial.
[3741.26 → 3755.26] And coming out of that, part of the same shared human experience of suffering is asking, probably most of the time, why?
[3755.26 → 3758.26] Why is this happening to me?
[3758.26 → 3760.26] Why would God let this happen to me?
[3760.26 → 3761.26] Why can't we fix it?
[3761.26 → 3763.26] Why is he sick?
[3763.26 → 3765.26] Why is she leaving?
[3765.26 → 3766.26] Why?
[3766.26 → 3768.26] We just don't know why.
[3768.26 → 3775.26] Now, why can sometimes be simple, but in the midst of our trials it rarely is, right?
[3775.26 → 3787.26] When my kids were really young, especially my oldest, Nora, she's not here, so I'm grateful for that this morning.
[3787.26 → 3790.26] She loved to ask why.
[3790.26 → 3792.26] You know the question.
[3792.26 → 3794.26] You know how it works with kids, right?
[3794.26 → 3800.26] Every time you ask them to do something, they turn to you, they look at you and say, why?
[3800.26 → 3809.26] Now, sometimes why can be heard as like a hard question or a question that puts people on the defensive.
[3809.26 → 3817.26] One of the things that I learned as a pastor in counselling training is not to ask why, but to reframe the question into different ways.
[3817.26 → 3824.26] And so, instead of saying why, we might say, what about that situation makes you feel that way?
[3824.26 → 3827.26] Or how did you come to think that way about this?
[3827.26 → 3837.26] And so, in our house, I would always redirect the why question, but my daughter is smart, and she learned that, and she picked up on it.
[3837.26 → 3843.26] And so, instead of asking why, Nora would eventually start to ask, well, how come?
[3843.26 → 3846.26] So I would say, would you please wash your hands before dinner?
[3846.26 → 3848.26] She'd go, how come?
[3848.26 → 3851.26] Well, because they're dirty, and I don't want you to get germs on them.
[3851.26 → 3852.26] Well, how come?
[3852.26 → 3854.26] Because germs are not for sharing.
[3854.26 → 3857.26] That was the title of a book that we had when we were young that Nora loved.
[3857.26 → 3859.26] No, Daddy, how come they're dirty?
[3859.26 → 3864.26] Well, because you got glue on them and marker on them when you were doing your crafts earlier.
[3864.26 → 3865.26] Well, how come?
[3865.26 → 3868.26] Well, because of the way you hold onto the marker, it gets stuff on your hands.
[3868.26 → 3871.26] No, how come germs are not for sharing?
[3871.26 → 3872.26] She would say.
[3872.26 → 3874.26] And on and on this would go.
[3874.26 → 3876.26] Why?
[3876.26 → 3883.26] From a young age, the question, how come, shaped our life as a family.
[3883.26 → 3885.26] Now, let's be honest again, right?
[3885.26 → 3888.26] That doesn't change as you get older.
[3888.26 → 3891.26] Sometimes they get a little bit harder, but they're still there.
[3891.26 → 3894.26] How come I can't play hockey on Sunday?
[3894.26 → 3895.26] Joey does.
[3895.26 → 3897.26] They go to the same church that we do.
[3897.26 → 3899.26] There's a touchy subject.
[3899.26 → 3902.26] Why are teenage girls so mean?
[3902.26 → 3905.26] There's another touchy subject.
[3905.26 → 3909.26] Why does mass equal weight in Newtons divided by the force of gravity?
[3909.26 → 3912.26] There's an unknown.
[3912.26 → 3914.26] Why do I have to go to college?
[3914.26 → 3918.26] But again, they can get even harder.
[3918.26 → 3920.26] Why did Grandma die?
[3920.26 → 3923.26] Why do I have cancer?
[3923.26 → 3928.26] If God is good and all-powerful, why is there evil in the world?
[3928.26 → 3939.26] And this last one is kind of the rub behind all of our questions, right?
[3939.26 → 3944.26] When things are bad, when we suffer, when things aren't going the way they want them to.
[3944.26 → 3948.26] If God is sovereign, why do I have to suffer?
[3948.26 → 3950.26] Can't God just fix it all?
[3950.26 → 3952.26] Or maybe we put it another way.
[3952.26 → 3954.26] Do I have to suffer?
[3954.26 → 3958.26] If God wants me to learn something, can't he just teach me another way?
[3958.26 → 3969.26] The tension that we've been living in this series of sermons is the truth that God is sovereign, that he is the supreme ruler.
[3969.26 → 3973.26] In the words of one theologian, Herman Bob ink, we said that,
[3973.26 → 3976.26] Apart from God, there is no existence or ownership.
[3976.26 → 3979.26] He alone has absolute authority.
[3979.26 → 3982.26] Always and everywhere his will decides.
[3982.26 → 3984.26] That's sovereignty.
[3984.26 → 3987.26] God is all-powerful, all-controlling, all-sovereign.
[3987.26 → 3991.26] Nothing happens, nothing, without his will.
[3991.26 → 3996.26] God created all things, Ephesians 3, 9.
[3996.26 → 4000.26] In him all things hold together, Colossians 1, 16.
[4000.26 → 4005.26] He sustains all things by his word of power, Hebrews 1, 3.
[4005.26 → 4008.26] Nothing exists apart from his will.
[4008.26 → 4010.26] Heidelberg Catechism question and answer 1 says,
[4010.26 → 4020.26] God also watches over me in such a way that not a hair can fall from my head without the will of my Father in heaven.
[4020.26 → 4027.26] The truth of the Bible that we have been living in and grounding upon is that God is sovereign.
[4027.26 → 4034.26] But the truth of our Bible and the truth of our shared experience is that we endure suffering.
[4034.26 → 4038.26] And becoming a follower of Jesus doesn't set us free from that.
[4038.26 → 4041.26] We don't get to escape it.
[4041.26 → 4043.26] Jesus actually says in John 16, 33,
[4043.26 → 4045.26] In this world you will have trouble.
[4045.26 → 4049.26] The psalmist gives us voice in Psalm 22 when he says,
[4049.26 → 4051.26] My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[4051.26 → 4052.26] Or in Psalm 42,
[4052.26 → 4058.26] My bones suffer mortal agony as my foes taunt me, saying to me all day long,
[4058.26 → 4060.26] Where is your God?
[4060.26 → 4065.26] And we've said that we live in the experience of this tension,
[4065.26 → 4072.26] but I've also made the claim that this tension is not a contradiction.
[4072.26 → 4086.26] And that we can give sufficient, I think, and compelling, cogent, philosophical and theological answers to the reason why of human suffering in the light of a sovereign God.
[4086.26 → 4088.26] We've talked about that in the past in this series.
[4088.26 → 4092.26] We talk about it every week in the Narthex podcast that we do.
[4092.26 → 4101.26] But what matters for me this morning and for us to hear this morning is the shift from why to how.
[4101.26 → 4106.26] How can we stand in the midst of suffering?
[4106.26 → 4111.26] That's what this God hints and our God hints have been about, right?
[4111.26 → 4113.26] Standing in the midst of suffering.
[4113.26 → 4115.26] Not so much the why.
[4115.26 → 4120.26] Because the truth is, in the midst of the valley of the shadow of death,
[4120.26 → 4124.26] in the midst of our bones crying out in mortal agony,
[4124.26 → 4126.26] in the midst of surgery and recovery,
[4126.26 → 4128.26] in the midst of death and dying,
[4128.26 → 4130.26] in the midst of depression and a dark night of the soul,
[4130.26 → 4133.26] in the midst of a spouse leaving,
[4133.26 → 4142.26] why matters little when compared to how can I stand.
[4142.26 → 4147.26] I just want to know how to survive this.
[4147.26 → 4149.26] Now hear that carefully.
[4149.26 → 4150.26] Right?
[4150.26 → 4153.26] We might ask the why question.
[4153.26 → 4154.26] But in asking the why question,
[4154.26 → 4159.26] I want to suggest that what we are really looking for is a way to push through.
[4159.26 → 4161.26] A way to survive.
[4161.26 → 4162.26] Right?
[4162.26 → 4164.26] Well, why is often asked.
[4164.26 → 4167.26] The answer that we need is how.
[4167.26 → 4168.26] How.
[4168.26 → 4173.26] And part of how for us is keeping God's vision of the future in mind.
[4173.26 → 4174.26] Right?
[4174.26 → 4176.26] We remember the meanwhile,
[4176.26 → 4179.26] that God has a plan and is actively bringing it out.
[4179.26 → 4183.26] We remind ourselves that God promises to never leave us nor forsake us,
[4183.26 → 4184.26] that we are not alone.
[4184.26 → 4188.26] And today, through the story of Joseph in Genesis 41,
[4188.26 → 4192.26] we are going to add the God hint of practicing presence.
[4192.26 → 4195.26] Practicing presence.
[4195.26 → 4197.26] I have drawn your attention to it once already.
[4197.26 → 4200.26] Verse 16 in our text,
[4200.26 → 4201.26] Joseph says,
[4201.26 → 4203.26] I cannot do it,
[4203.26 → 4206.26] but God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires.
[4206.26 → 4207.26] I cannot do it.
[4207.26 → 4208.26] I don't know,
[4208.26 → 4210.26] but I know the one who does.
[4210.26 → 4212.26] I know the one who can.
[4212.26 → 4215.26] God will give you the answer,
[4215.26 → 4216.26] but God will give you the answer.
[4216.26 → 4217.26] In verse 39,
[4217.26 → 4218.26] Pharaoh says to Joseph,
[4218.26 → 4220.26] God has made all this known to you.
[4220.26 → 4223.26] God has made all this known to you.
[4223.26 → 4228.26] God's presence is with you, and he is making himself known to you.
[4228.26 → 4230.26] And so,
[4230.26 → 4231.26] with this God hint,
[4231.26 → 4233.26] I want to suggest to you,
[4233.26 → 4244.26] the best way to survive suffering and hardship is to practice the presence of God with us.
[4244.26 → 4246.26] Now, very clearly,
[4246.26 → 4252.26] what I want you to hear at this first step on this journey is that I'm talking about the best way.
[4252.26 → 4253.26] Right?
[4253.26 → 4254.26] There are other ways.
[4254.26 → 4257.26] And again, let me be really clear.
[4257.26 → 4265.26] You don't have to be a Christian or you don't even have to have a particular understanding of God or of the world to get through hardship.
[4265.26 → 4268.26] But I do believe that this is the best way.
[4268.26 → 4269.26] Right?
[4269.26 → 4275.26] All of us, whether you are Christian or not, whether you are religious, any type of religious or not,
[4275.26 → 4284.26] all of us have experienced some form of trial and hardship, and we've made it through, or we're making it through.
[4284.26 → 4285.26] Right?
[4285.26 → 4291.26] The testimony of human history is overcoming hardship and trial and challenges.
[4291.26 → 4294.26] This might sound strange for a pastor to say,
[4294.26 → 4296.26] you don't need Jesus for that.
[4296.26 → 4298.26] You need resolve.
[4298.26 → 4299.26] You need perseverance.
[4299.26 → 4301.26] Maybe a little stubbornness.
[4301.26 → 4306.26] But I'm not just talking about getting through it today.
[4306.26 → 4307.26] Right?
[4307.26 → 4311.26] And though sometimes that maybe that's all we're expected to do,
[4311.26 → 4314.26] I'm talking about suffering with purpose.
[4314.26 → 4316.26] I'm talking about a better way.
[4316.26 → 4323.26] I'm talking about being transformed from one degree of glory to another through suffering.
[4323.26 → 4333.26] And I think that the best way to do that, the key here, is the practice of the presence of God.
[4333.26 → 4340.26] Now, very clearly, I'm using that as a technical phrase, practicing the presence of God.
[4340.26 → 4350.26] It's a phrase that I'm borrowing from a 17th century French Carmelite monk named Brother Lawrence.
[4350.26 → 4356.26] He defines this, practicing the presence of God, as this.
[4356.26 → 4363.26] After having given myself wholly to God, to make all the satisfaction I could for my sins,
[4363.26 → 4369.26] I renounce for the love of Him everything that was not He.
[4369.26 → 4382.26] And I begin to live as if there were none but He and I in the world.
[4382.26 → 4388.26] And he works that out in his correspondences and writings.
[4388.26 → 4390.26] And he continues, he says,
[4390.26 → 4395.26] The time of busyness does not with me differ from the time of prayer.
[4395.26 → 4401.26] In the noise and clatter of my kitchen, while several persons are at the same time calling for different things,
[4401.26 → 4409.26] I possess God in as great tranquility as if I were upon my knees at the blessed sacrament.
[4409.26 → 4418.26] That's practicing the presence such that whether you're doing dishes in the kitchen or you're here in worship,
[4418.26 → 4427.26] the experience of God's nearness to you is there, is in you and with you.
[4427.26 → 4433.26] And so, as we prepare for suffering, as we stand in the midst of suffering,
[4433.26 → 4440.26] even as we try to just survive our suffering, I want to ask you,
[4440.26 → 4445.26] how are you practicing the presence of God with us?
[4445.26 → 4449.26] Or in the language of this story in verse 39, right,
[4449.26 → 4452.26] what patterns and behaviours, habits, attitudes, decisions,
[4452.26 → 4460.26] what disciplines have you put in place for God to make all this known to you?
[4460.26 → 4469.26] Joseph, in this part of the story, didn't know why he had to experience so much heartache
[4469.26 → 4472.26] or misunderstandings or hardship.
[4472.26 → 4477.26] He could have looked around, and it probably would have been easy for him to say,
[4477.26 → 4479.26] None of this makes sense.
[4479.26 → 4481.26] Everything went wrong.
[4481.26 → 4484.26] God, at the beginning, you told me that people would bow down to me
[4484.26 → 4488.26] and I've spent the last 11 years in prison.
[4488.26 → 4496.26] Josephs why could have been loud, and we would understand it.
[4496.26 → 4501.26] But instead, what he's revealing for us is his how.
[4501.26 → 4503.26] How could he stand?
[4503.26 → 4506.26] How could he know the presence of God was with him,
[4506.26 → 4511.26] making himself known to him and to those around him through him?
[4511.26 → 4516.26] And so maybe the trick isn't so much a priority on what you do,
[4516.26 → 4519.26] but instead on what God is doing.
[4521.26 → 4526.26] This week, last Friday, I had the chance to go with Nora
[4526.26 → 4532.26] to Gallery 7's production of Prince Caspian in Abbotsford.
[4532.26 → 4538.26] Prince Caspian is a story written by C.S. Lewis in the Chronicles of Narnia series.
[4538.26 → 4540.26] There was a few of us from church who were there, actually.
[4540.26 → 4542.26] Good to see you again.
[4542.26 → 4549.26] And that story and the playwrights, Damien Atkins, who compiled it based on that work,
[4549.26 → 4553.26] begins with a sort of monologue as a way of introduction.
[4553.26 → 4558.26] And I couldn't find the script because I didn't want to pay for it.
[4558.26 → 4562.26] So I'm paraphrasing out of my own memory.
[4562.26 → 4567.26] But as part of the monologue at the beginning, part of the introduction to the play,
[4567.26 → 4570.26] the doctor, who sort of functions as the narrator throughout,
[4570.26 → 4572.26] says,
[4572.26 → 4579.26] Looking back on a story, we can all see the steps that got us to the end.
[4579.26 → 4586.26] While we are in the story, all we can do is take that next step forward in faith,
[4586.26 → 4589.26] knowing that we'll get somewhere.
[4589.26 → 4592.26] And so maybe you're in the middle of a story that's being written,
[4592.26 → 4595.26] and you have no idea what the end is.
[4595.26 → 4600.26] The how for you becomes that next step of faith.
[4600.26 → 4604.26] And so what do you do when you feel like life is passing you by
[4604.26 → 4606.26] or spiralling out of control?
[4606.26 → 4611.26] What if you do is you can't find help or deliverance or relief today or tomorrow
[4611.26 → 4613.26] or it doesn't look like it's going to come anytime soon?
[4613.26 → 4619.26] What happens when things are unclear or unconvincing or uncomfortable?
[4619.26 → 4625.26] What is true for you when things change or when time flies
[4625.26 → 4626.26] or when people disappoint you?
[4626.26 → 4629.26] Because people will always disappoint you.
[4629.26 → 4636.26] What does stepping forward in faith look like for you?
[4636.26 → 4641.26] And perhaps paradoxically for Joseph, it meant waiting.
[4641.26 → 4644.26] It meant standing still. It meant waiting on God.
[4644.26 → 4648.26] That's part of practicing the presence.
[4648.26 → 4651.26] And so how do you wait?
[4651.26 → 4652.26] Now here's what I believe.
[4652.26 → 4659.26] I believe that God makes himself known to us through word and sacraments,
[4659.26 → 4663.26] through praise and prayer, and through his people.
[4663.26 → 4670.26] And when we come to God in prayer and praise, we are practicing the presence.
[4670.26 → 4676.26] God promises to show up in a special and unique way when we come to him together,
[4676.26 → 4680.26] singing his praises and lifting our prayers as a community.
[4680.26 → 4686.26] That's a given to us according to the word of God, where in Matthew 18 we can read,
[4686.26 → 4693.26] When two or three are gathered in my name, there I am with them also.
[4693.26 → 4702.26] And so I ask you if God promises to show up here, how are you showing up here?
[4702.26 → 4709.26] Are you bringing all of who you are, all of it, the garbage, the trials, the crap, everything,
[4709.26 → 4714.26] Are you bringing all of who you are into the presence of all of who God is?
[4714.26 → 4717.26] The fullness of yourself into the fullness of God.
[4717.26 → 4719.26] That's this sacred space.
[4722.26 → 4724.26] Or are you coming here behind a mask?
[4727.26 → 4732.26] Are you coming here in your best dressed, best quaffed hair,
[4732.26 → 4739.26] So that no one would see the truth of what's going on in your heart and in your mind?
[4739.26 → 4745.26] Do you cover up and cower behind a posture or a position?
[4746.26 → 4751.26] Are you bringing everything into this encounter with the living God?
[4752.26 → 4760.26] Practicing the presence of God comes by being fully present in the place where God says he will be,
[4760.26 → 4766.26] And through the people in whom God says he will reside.
[4770.26 → 4773.26] Again, in this play, Prince Caspian,
[4774.26 → 4781.26] Later, down near the end, the Prevented children have to make their way from
[4782.26 → 4786.26] Caerperivel, which is now in ruins, to the how of Aslan, the lion,
[4786.26 → 4790.26] And they have to choose between one direction or another.
[4790.26 → 4797.26] And this direction looks impossible, it looks unlikely, and this direction looks at least plausible, if hard.
[4798.26 → 4801.26] And Lucy sees Aslan in the distance and says,
[4802.26 → 4804.26] We have to go that way. He's calling us to go that way.
[4804.26 → 4805.26] But no one else does.
[4806.26 → 4808.26] Peter, Susan, and Edmund say,
[4808.26 → 4810.26] No, I didn't see him. We need to go this way.
[4810.26 → 4812.26] And so they go that way.
[4814.26 → 4818.26] And it turns out they journey for hours and hours and hours and get nowhere.
[4818.26 → 4824.26] They come to an impassable, what used to be a creek, a thousand years later in the story is now a ravine.
[4826.26 → 4828.26] And so finally they turn and say,
[4828.26 → 4830.26] Maybe we should have listened to Lucy.
[4830.26 → 4834.26] And Lucy says, There, I see him again. Over there. Can't you see him?
[4834.26 → 4836.26] And all the kids turn, and they don't see him.
[4836.26 → 4838.26] They don't see Aslan.
[4838.26 → 4841.26] But Lucy says, No, he's there. We have to go this way.
[4841.26 → 4843.26] And they all say, I don't think we can.
[4844.26 → 4845.26] Because I don't see him.
[4846.26 → 4849.26] And Lucy says, Whether you can or not doesn't matter.
[4850.26 → 4851.26] I can. I'm going.
[4853.26 → 4855.26] And then they join her.
[4856.26 → 4857.26] And they journey with her.
[4857.26 → 4858.26] And they follow her.
[4858.26 → 4866.26] And the way they did it at Gallery 7 was a beautifully constructed, precarious trip of places they could not know how to get.
[4867.26 → 4869.26] And would never have been able to find on their own.
[4871.26 → 4880.26] And they have to scale mountains that they could not possibly have scaled except for this tiny little goat path that they were led to by this lion that only one of them could see.
[4884.26 → 4887.26] People of God, you are Lucy.
[4888.26 → 4894.26] Or, you are Peter, Edmund, and Susan needing to follow a Lucy.
[4895.26 → 4900.26] Either way, follow the one who says, I'm following after Christ.
[4900.26 → 4906.26] That's how this community thing works in experiencing the presence of God.
[4907.26 → 4909.26] You might not know which way to go.
[4909.26 → 4910.26] But someone here does.
[4911.26 → 4913.26] You might not know how to journey this path.
[4913.26 → 4915.26] But someone here will journey it with you.
[4916.26 → 4922.26] That's how we practice the presence of God together.
[4922.26 → 4923.26] Together.
[4923.26 → 4926.26] We follow after him.
[4926.26 → 4937.26] And maybe your how today is trusting someone who knows when you don't.
[4937.26 → 4949.26] In Ezekiel 3 and Jeremiah 15 and in Revelation 10, God says to the prophets, and he says to John,
[4950.26 → 4952.26] eat this scroll.
[4952.26 → 4953.26] Take it in.
[4953.26 → 4954.26] This is God's revelation of himself.
[4954.26 → 4968.26] This is how God is making himself known to the world.
[4968.26 → 4973.26] This is how we come to see God.
[4973.26 → 4977.26] God's word is the how of our knowing him.
[4977.26 → 4980.26] It's the primary way we come into his presence.
[4980.26 → 4985.26] And so, for you to practice the presence must involve the practice of the word.
[4985.26 → 4989.26] And so, how are you eating the word?
[4989.26 → 4992.26] How are you devouring the word?
[4996.26 → 4998.26] Let's continue this analogy.
[4999.26 → 5009.26] If you wanted to survive, or maybe even if you wanted to thrive, how many meals a week would you eat?
[5010.26 → 5012.26] Someone do the math.
[5012.26 → 5014.26] 21?
[5015.26 → 5016.26] Roughly?
[5016.26 → 5020.26] Probably like 15 for those of us who skip a meal or two here and there.
[5021.26 → 5023.26] But never only twice.
[5024.26 → 5025.26] Never only once.
[5026.26 → 5029.26] How many of us are eating the word only once a week?
[5030.26 → 5031.26] And we hope to survive?
[5032.26 → 5033.26] We hope to thrive?
[5033.26 → 5047.26] If the only time you crack your Bible is when you come to church, it's going to be real hard to experience the presence of God.
[5047.26 → 5054.26] If the only time you practice presence in community is when you're sitting here on Sunday.
[5054.26 → 5055.26] And please, don't hear what I'm not saying.
[5056.26 → 5057.26] Sit here on Sunday.
[5058.26 → 5060.26] Right? If that's going to be your only time, let it be a good time.
[5061.26 → 5062.26] Let it be a full-time.
[5062.26 → 5064.26] Let it be a time when you feast on his word.
[5064.26 → 5068.26] But it's never going to be enough on its own.
[5069.26 → 5071.26] Eat this word.
[5071.26 → 5073.26] Practice the presence of God.
[5074.26 → 5075.26] Right?
[5075.26 → 5077.26] And not just here, but in the presence of other believers.
[5077.26 → 5079.26] We talked about care groups earlier in announcements.
[5079.26 → 5085.26] Get connected with people because that is how God gets connected with us.
[5086.26 → 5095.26] And then lastly, as we land this plane together, another way we practice the presence is through this Lord's Supper that we're about to come to.
[5096.26 → 5098.26] This meal that he has given us.
[5099.26 → 5103.26] This bread and this cup become for us the body and the blood of Jesus.
[5103.26 → 5105.26] We take him in.
[5105.26 → 5108.26] The Gospel of John opens by saying,
[5108.26 → 5112.26] In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God.
[5112.26 → 5114.26] He was with God in the beginning.
[5114.26 → 5116.26] And then in verse 14, he writes,
[5117.26 → 5120.26] The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.
[5120.26 → 5122.26] Jesus is the Word of God.
[5123.26 → 5126.26] Jesus is the fullest revelation of God that we have.
[5126.26 → 5130.26] Jesus who came and lived the life I should have lived and died the death that I deserve.
[5130.26 → 5133.26] Jesus who was raised victorious over sin and death.
[5133.26 → 5136.26] Three days later, this same Jesus says to us,
[5136.26 → 5144.26] Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life and I will raise them up on the last day.
[5144.26 → 5147.26] We devour the Word in daily devotion.
[5147.26 → 5151.26] We eat the scroll when we come to the table.
[5152.26 → 5154.26] May this be part of your how.
[5154.26 → 5159.26] And that changes our approach to suffering.
[5159.26 → 5164.26] Because Jesus embraced his suffering for your sake.
[5164.26 → 5167.26] And now he invites you to embrace suffering for his.
[5168.26 → 5172.26] Brother Lawrence comes back to this idea.
[5172.26 → 5175.26] And he says,
[5175.26 → 5183.26] Pains and suffering would be a paradise to me while I should suffer with my God.
[5184.26 → 5190.26] And the greatest pleasure would be hell to me if I could relish them without him.
[5190.26 → 5197.26] Suffering with God changes them.
[5197.26 → 5204.26] Having all you could ever ask for without God changes that too.
[5205.26 → 5207.26] Now you might hear that, and you go,
[5207.26 → 5208.26] Yeah, you know what pastor?
[5208.26 → 5209.26] He's a monk.
[5209.26 → 5211.26] And it was the 17th century.
[5211.26 → 5213.26] Life was different then.
[5213.26 → 5215.26] How could, it would be easier for him to be like,
[5215.26 → 5216.26] All I have is Jesus.
[5216.26 → 5218.26] All I need is Jesus.
[5218.26 → 5221.26] He doesn't know what it's like to raise four kids.
[5221.26 → 5228.26] He doesn't know what it's like to drive those four kids from one soccer event to another hockey event to a summer baseball camp.
[5228.26 → 5231.26] He doesn't know what my life is like.
[5233.26 → 5234.26] And you're right.
[5235.26 → 5236.26] He doesn't.
[5237.26 → 5239.26] But maybe again, as we think about how.
[5239.26 → 5247.26] Maybe your how is better understood in the choices you make.
[5247.26 → 5251.26] The small, simple, daily choices you make.
[5254.26 → 5260.26] Recently, it came to my attention, my self-awareness,
[5261.26 → 5263.26] that every morning when I woke up,
[5263.26 → 5271.26] the first thing I would do was reach over and grab my phone and look at social media.
[5272.26 → 5275.26] Now I trust that most of you are better at life than I am.
[5276.26 → 5278.26] But I'm sure some of you can relate to what I'm talking about.
[5279.26 → 5280.26] What emails did I miss?
[5281.26 → 5282.26] What texts have come in?
[5282.26 → 5284.26] What's this person up to?
[5284.26 → 5287.26] The first thing I did was go to social media.
[5288.26 → 5290.26] And I asked myself,
[5293.26 → 5295.26] Is this really the way I want to start my day?
[5296.26 → 5300.26] Is this really the priority I want to take in my life?
[5301.26 → 5303.26] Is this how I want to set up the rest of my day?
[5303.26 → 5311.72] for the last few months I have been intentionally practicing a different discipline and so now
[5311.72 → 5317.00] when my alarm goes off the first thing I do before I even put my foot down out of bed is I start
[5317.00 → 5326.18] praying and I spend five or ten minutes praying. Now sometimes I fall back asleep sure, but I wake
[5326.18 → 5335.16] up again, and I continue praying, and intentionally I'm not picking up the phone, but I'm diving in to
[5335.16 → 5343.14] the presence of God, and I'm asking if I can start my day differently and if that will set an agenda
[5343.14 → 5349.60] for the rest of it, and I'm still learning but I have to tell you it's a different way to start.
[5349.60 → 5358.08] That's a small choice. Just a small choice. Maybe that's your how. What is your small choice?
[5358.74 → 5366.46] Practice the presence of God by coming to receive his word, by eating the scroll, coming into his
[5366.46 → 5370.52] presence at the table and in community and in fellowship
[5370.52 → 5379.82] and you will see that the Lord is your refuge and your strength in times of trouble. Psalm 9.
[5380.94 → 5390.30] That as we have prayed our times are in his hands. Psalm 31. And that you can trust him at all times.
[5391.04 → 5399.30] Psalm 62. May this word and this sacrament be for you an experience of God's presence among us no
[5399.30 → 5406.84] matter where you are, where you come from or what trial you are in the midst of. And so now let's come
[5406.84 → 5418.30] to the table as a place where God's presence is confirmed among us. This is our prayer. This is our
[5418.30 → 5428.32] praise from word and now to sacrament that we may be before the face of our God. And to that end
[5428.32 → 5446.32] I will pray. Let's pray together. Lord, our God, meet us at this table even as you have met us in your word,
[5446.32 → 5454.94] even as you have gathered us up in your presence, even as you go with us into the week ahead.
[5454.94 → 5463.46] May we practice the presence of God. And so God, I pray that on our hearts today,
[5463.66 → 5473.26] you would lay maybe just one small choice as we consider how we might practice your presence
[5473.26 → 5476.90] among us. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[5481.78 → 5488.62] As we come to the table, we come invited by our God. We come to meet him here. And so we will have
[5488.62 → 5494.66] a liturgy of our practice together that will be responsive. I invite you to follow along on the
[5494.66 → 5501.04] screen and speak those words that are spoken, indicated for you. I believe they're in yellow behind me.
[5501.04 → 5512.38] Lift your hearts. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. Let's pray.
[5512.38 → 5522.88] With joy, we praise you, gracious God. For you have created heaven and earth. You've made us in your
[5522.88 → 5529.38] image, and you have kept covenant with us even when we fell into sin. We give you thanks for Jesus Christ,
[5529.38 → 5538.42] who by his life, death, and resurrection opened to us the way of life everlasting. And so meet us here,
[5538.42 → 5542.18] we pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[5546.86 → 5551.98] The bread that we break is a sharing in the body of Christ.
[5551.98 → 5581.80] Jesus said, I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry,
[5581.80 → 5590.56] and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. Those who wish to serve him must first be served by him.
[5591.24 → 5595.48] And those who want to follow him must first be led and fed by him.
[5596.48 → 5600.08] For this is the table where God intends us to be nourished.
[5600.48 → 5603.14] This is the time when Christ can make us new.
[5603.14 → 5609.46] And so come, you who hunger and thirst for a deeper faith, for a better life, for a fairer world.
[5609.90 → 5617.02] Jesus Christ, who met us in the word, now invites us to be guests at his table.
[5617.02 → 5626.10] As we come to the table, I'm going to invite you to share and profess our shared faith together by reciting the Apostles' Creed.
[5626.10 → 5628.00] So I'm going to ask that you might stand.
[5631.32 → 5637.18] And we're going to say the words of the Apostles' Creed, which has been a testimony of faith in the Christian church
[5637.18 → 5643.36] for some time since the 3rd or 4th century, since the 8th century, in the form that we have it here.
[5643.36 → 5648.20] We are not only professing our union with Christ in these words,
[5648.38 → 5653.38] but our connection to the historic and traditional Christian church in these words.
[5653.50 → 5657.54] And so for those of you who believe, we say together,
[5658.20 → 5663.52] I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
[5664.20 → 5667.94] I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,
[5668.96 → 5672.78] received by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary.
[5673.36 → 5678.22] He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.
[5679.00 → 5680.20] He descended into hell.
[5680.96 → 5683.60] The third day, he rose again from the dead.
[5684.22 → 5689.34] He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty.
[5690.06 → 5693.26] From there, he will come to judge the living and the dead.
[5693.26 → 5702.32] I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins,
[5702.84 → 5706.40] the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.
[5707.22 → 5707.54] Amen.
[5708.54 → 5709.14] You may be seated.
[5709.14 → 5717.10] If this is your profession, whether you are here with us or joining us online,
[5717.10 → 5721.30] you are invited to the table of our Lord.
[5722.10 → 5725.98] These are the gifts of God for the people of God.
[5725.98 → 5730.96] As we come to the table here at Emmanuel, we do this in a particular way.
[5731.12 → 5735.92] And so we experience the presence of God by standing in the presence of his people.
[5736.46 → 5738.74] And so we will come forward in groups.
[5738.90 → 5742.30] There will be ushers who indicate which row comes forward.
[5742.58 → 5745.46] We will gather in a circle around the table together.
[5745.46 → 5750.16] As you pass the bread to the person to your left or right,
[5750.28 → 5753.20] I invite you to say the body of Christ given for you.
[5753.56 → 5756.92] As you pass the juice, again, to the person to your left or right,
[5757.00 → 5760.02] I invite you to say the blood of Christ shed for you.
[5761.10 → 5768.10] In this way, we together speak the presence of God and be the presence of God to one another.
[5768.88 → 5773.68] If you are in need of gluten-free service for preference,
[5773.68 → 5777.98] there are a few pieces in the middle of each tray that are kept set out.
[5778.44 → 5782.96] If you would like to receive gluten-free for more than preference,
[5783.04 → 5785.86] if you're celiac or something, we have something fully separate to the side
[5785.86 → 5788.20] for you to be able to take from there.
[5788.82 → 5792.40] And we serve only juice here at Emmanuel as well.
[5793.50 → 5798.14] I'm going to invite the elders and the worship team to come forward,
[5798.24 → 5799.22] the back-of-house people.
[5799.22 → 5805.58] We will serve them first so that they can serve us by leading in worship and song
[5805.58 → 5808.44] as the rest of us come to this table together.
[5812.78 → 5816.34] Additionally, if you would like to meet someone for prayer,
[5816.66 → 5822.48] either during or before coming to the table or in spite or lieu of coming to the table,
[5822.98 → 5826.74] there will be people in the foyer at the back with yellow name tags on
[5826.74 → 5828.76] who would love to meet you for prayer there.
[5837.64 → 5839.18] Body of Christ given for you.
[5842.34 → 5843.68] Body of Christ given for you.
[5843.68 → 5843.70] Body of Christ given for you.
[5856.74 → 5867.64] Body of Christ given for you.
[5869.64 → 5871.44] Body of Christ given for you.
[5871.44 → 5872.62] Thanks be to God.
[5877.10 → 5878.78] Eat and remember.
[5878.78 → 5879.40] CGI's body of Christ.
[5890.26 → 5891.62] Blood of Christ, shed for you.
[5892.78 → 5896.60] Blood of Christ, shed for you.
[5896.60 → 5926.58] Thank you.
[5926.60 → 5940.18] Drink and believe.
[5940.18 → 5943.74] Amen.
[5956.60 → 5974.98] Good morning.
[5975.76 → 5976.20] Hey, buddy.
[5976.20 → 5978.20] Amen.
[5978.20 → 5980.20] Amen.
[5980.20 → 5982.20] Amen.
[5982.20 → 5984.20] Amen.
[5984.20 → 5985.20] Amen.
[5985.20 → 5986.20] Amen.
[5986.20 → 5988.20] Amen.
[5988.20 → 5990.20] Amen.
[5990.20 → 5991.20] Amen.
[5991.20 → 5992.20] Amen.
[5992.20 → 5993.20] Amen.
[5993.20 → 5994.20] Amen.
[5994.20 → 5995.20] Amen.
[5995.20 → 6002.20] Behold the Lamb who bears our sins away, save for us.
[6002.20 → 6004.20] Amen.
