[656.14 → 667.14] Happy Thanksgiving to you all.
[667.14 → 673.14] Okay, maybe it's happy Thanksgiving for like one of you.
[673.14 → 675.14] Thanks, Amanda.
[675.14 → 678.14] Welcome to Emanuel Church.
[678.14 → 681.14] A special welcome if you are a guest with us this weekend.
[681.14 → 685.14] If you're a guest because of Thanksgiving, you're visiting family and friends,
[685.14 → 689.14] we're really excited that you are here today to worship with us.
[689.14 → 690.14] My name is Chris.
[690.14 → 695.14] I'm one of the pastors here at Emanuel, and it's my pleasure, along with a few others,
[695.14 → 697.14] to lead in our shared worship this morning.
[697.14 → 702.14] Before we begin, we have a couple announcements to make.
[702.14 → 706.14] And Kim Print has an announcement that she's going to make.
[706.14 → 708.14] Yeah.
[708.14 → 712.14] So we're going to invite Kim to the front as she makes an announcement.
[712.14 → 715.14] There's a microphone over there for you.
[719.14 → 721.14] I've been here for at least 20 minutes.
[721.14 → 724.14] So, hi, everybody.
[724.14 → 726.14] We are doing Safe Church.
[726.14 → 730.14] I'm not part of the Safe Church committee, but I will be running the Safe Church training.
[730.14 → 733.14] There is two happening.
[733.14 → 739.14] One is this week, Wednesday, the 16th, and the second is next week, Tuesday, the 22nd.
[739.14 → 742.14] These are mandatory for every three years.
[742.14 → 745.14] It's going to be really exciting, very interesting.
[745.14 → 747.14] There will be chocolate.
[747.14 → 748.14] Please come.
[748.14 → 751.14] We'd love to have you.
[751.14 → 756.14] There you go.
[756.14 → 757.14] There will be chocolate.
[757.14 → 760.14] If ever there was an enticement, that's the one.
[760.14 → 763.14] I'm going to keep running through some announcements.
[763.14 → 769.14] So, next Saturday, we're running an AED CPR training event here.
[769.14 → 774.14] If you've signed up for that, just a reminder that that's happening, and that's next Saturday.
[774.14 → 777.14] If you have any questions, Heather Astra is here.
[777.14 → 782.14] She's at the back, but she'll gladly answer your questions about that.
[783.14 → 789.14] Additionally, after church today, we're having part two of our new members class.
[789.14 → 796.14] And so, if you joined us last week for that, I invite you to stick around after church today for part two of that class.
[796.14 → 799.14] And we will have a light lunch together.
[799.14 → 803.14] And there is childcare for those of you who are sticking around for that.
[803.14 → 812.14] And then, next Sunday evening at 7 p.m., we're starting a Heidelberg Catechism reading group.
[812.14 → 816.14] And this is a sort of adult education kind of opportunity.
[816.14 → 817.14] We're going to come together.
[817.14 → 825.14] We're going to read the first, I don't know, seven or eight Lord's Days, and then just have a conversation about what it means, what comes up, what it means, what it means.
[825.14 → 830.14] What comes up, what we're moved to and stirred by in that.
[830.14 → 834.14] That happens during HCBC for the youth.
[834.14 → 842.14] And so, if you drop a kid off for HCBC for the youth, you might as well stick around and participate in the group that we're running here for that.
[842.14 → 844.14] And then Kevin has an announcement.
[844.14 → 845.14] Hello, hello.
[845.14 → 847.14] Oh, it's coming on.
[847.14 → 848.14] There it is.
[848.14 → 850.14] Good morning, everybody.
[850.14 → 853.14] I've got an announcement on behalf of Brandon Muller and the Mexico team.
[853.14 → 854.14] Mexico registration.
[854.14 → 859.14] If you are in grade 10 or older, and that doesn't mean to grade 12, that means older.
[859.14 → 864.14] All the way up, you are welcome to sign up and register to join the Mexico trip this year.
[864.14 → 866.14] We're hoping to have that sorted out soon.
[866.14 → 874.14] The only hitch is we're still tentatively planning on going in March, but the base that we have been staying at for years and years is no longer hosting teams.
[874.14 → 878.14] And so, they have sold and are being bought out by someone.
[878.14 → 881.14] We are looking for a new base.
[881.14 → 882.14] The hope is to still go in March.
[882.14 → 884.14] It might have to be a different time of the year.
[884.14 → 887.14] Either way, we'd love to know some numbers and get a sense of who's interested in coming.
[887.14 → 888.14] So, please register.
[888.14 → 889.14] You can talk to Brandon.
[889.14 → 890.14] He's in the back.
[890.14 → 891.14] He's waving.
[891.14 → 892.14] You can come chat with me a little bit too.
[892.14 → 894.14] And we can give you more information about that.
[894.14 → 895.14] Thanks.
[895.14 → 896.14] Excellent.
[896.14 → 897.14] Okay.
[897.14 → 899.14] I think that's it for announcements.
[899.14 → 903.14] And so, if you are able and where you are, would you rise together?
[903.14 → 906.14] We are going to come together as we come into God's presence.
[906.14 → 912.14] We give thanks this weekend, and we rightfully do so in the presence of our God.
[912.14 → 915.14] And so, we're going to receive God's greeting together.
[915.14 → 930.14] And then following God's greeting, I'm going to invite you just to turn to those around you and to welcome them in worship with a handshake, a fist bump, a head nod, a hug if you're particularly familiar, a glare if you don't want a hug.
[930.14 → 937.14] But we greet each other in the name of the Lord as an extension of God greeting us.
[937.14 → 939.14] And so, receive God's greeting together.
[939.14 → 947.14] Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, His Son and
[947.14 → 950.14] our Saviour, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[950.14 → 951.14] Amen.
[951.14 → 952.14] Amen.
[952.14 → 953.14] Amen.
[981.14 → 999.14] Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 47.
[999.14 → 1003.14] God has ascended amidst shouts of joy.
[1003.14 → 1006.14] The Lord amid the sounds of trumpets.
[1006.14 → 1008.14] Sing praise to God.
[1008.14 → 1009.14] Sing praises.
[1009.14 → 1012.14] Sing praises to our King.
[1012.14 → 1013.14] Sing praises.
[1013.14 → 1016.14] For God is the King of all the earth.
[1016.14 → 1019.14] Sing to Him a psalm of praise.
[1019.14 → 1033.14] And go to the God of praise.
[1034.14 → 1039.14] Good comments.

[1189.14 → 1196.14] You are my prince of peace. I will live my life for you.
[1196.14 → 1205.14] You are my prince of peace. I will live my life for you.
[1205.14 → 1208.70] Please join me in prayer.
[1208.70 → 1216.70] God, we come to you on this Thanksgiving weekend, grateful for all that you have done for us.
[1217.14 → 1222.28] We are forgiven, cleansed, and freed by your sacrifice on the cross.
[1223.24 → 1226.62] We know that we do not live in this freedom every day.
[1227.76 → 1231.84] Sin grips us. Sin causes us to rely on ourselves.
[1231.84 → 1237.84] Sin has a hold on us, and we cannot find freedom from it without you.
[1239.04 → 1242.26] Forgive us, Lord, when we forget your goodness.
[1243.62 → 1246.28] Restore in us the joy of your salvation.
[1247.62 → 1253.26] Remind us to be thankful, not only today, but every day, for your gift of life.
[1253.26 → 1257.28] Help us to live that out each and every day.
[1258.06 → 1258.40] Amen.
[1258.40 → 1258.54] Amen.
[1283.26 → 1289.60] Thank you for saving me.
[1289.60 → 1294.50] What can I say?
[1294.50 → 1300.30] You are my everything.
[1300.30 → 1306.90] I will sing your praise.
[1306.90 → 1313.02] You shed your love for me.
[1313.26 → 1318.26] What can I say?
[1318.26 → 1319.26] What can I say?
[1319.26 → 1325.26] You took my sin and shame.
[1325.26 → 1331.26] The sinner called my name.
[1331.26 → 1341.26] Praise the Lord.
[1341.26 → 1343.26] Praise the Lord.
[1343.26 → 1353.26] Praise the Lord.
[1353.26 → 1365.26] For we know your truth has set us free.
[1365.26 → 1375.26] You set your love with me.
[1375.26 → 1376.26] Praise the Lord.
[1376.26 → 1397.78] Praise the Lord.
[1397.78 → 1427.76] Thank you.
[1427.78 → 1457.76] Thank you.
[1457.78 → 1466.78] You set your hope in me.
[1469.78 → 1476.78] Thank you for saving me.
[1476.78 → 1482.78] What can I say?
[1482.78 → 1483.78] Amen.
[1483.78 → 1484.78] Thank you.
[1484.78 → 1485.78] Thank you.
[1485.78 → 1486.78] Thank you.
[1486.78 → 1491.78] Please join us in a responsive reading of the Heidelberg Catechism, question number 43.
[1491.78 → 1499.78] What further benefit do we receive from Christ's sacrifice and death on the cross?
[1499.78 → 1508.78] Through Christ's death, our old nature is crucified, put to death, and buried with Him, so that
[1508.78 → 1515.78] the evil desires of the flesh may no longer reign in us, but that we may offer ourselves
[1515.78 → 1520.78] to Him as a sacrifice of thankfulness.
[1520.78 → 1521.78] Thank you.
[1521.78 → 1522.78] Thank you.
[1522.78 → 1523.78] Thank you.
[1523.78 → 1524.78] Thank you.
[1524.78 → 1525.78] Thank you.
[1525.78 → 1526.78] Thank you.
[1526.78 → 1527.78] Thank you.
[1527.78 → 1528.78] Thank you.
[1528.78 → 1529.78] Thank you.
[1529.78 → 1530.78] Thank you.
[1530.78 → 1535.78] Thank you.
[1535.78 → 1552.16] Put a new song in my heart, let me hear the greatest song, distill the light and give me that again.
[1552.16 → 1571.16] Put a new song in my mind, help me leave the last beyond, and break these chains that I'm not here again.
[1571.16 → 1585.16] Lift my fallen face, and help me accept, love me with the grace that comes from your hand, gives me from my sin.
[1585.16 → 1592.16] Lord, forgive me again, that I might be yours alone.
[1601.16 → 1615.16] Put a new fire in my soul, make this ruthless spirit whole, and help me see that I am free again.
[1615.16 → 1630.16] Let these broken bones rise up and rejoice, bring the captive home, and lift my voice, tell my spirit, sing,
[1630.16 → 1646.16] that I am free again, that I am free again, and help me accept, love me with the grace that comes from your hand,
[1646.16 → 1655.16] let me feel my sin, Lord, forgive me again, that I might be yours alone.
[1655.16 → 1660.16] Let these broken bones rise up and rejoice, bring the captive home, and help me with the grace that comes from your hand,
[1660.16 → 1665.16] let me feel my soul, and help me with the grace that comes from your hand,
[1665.16 → 1669.16] let me feel my soul, and help me with the grace that comes from your hand.
[1669.16 → 1673.16] Let these broken bones rise up and hope you may have been taken by the grace that comes from your hand,
[1673.16 → 1675.16] let me feel my soul, and help you with the grace that comes from your hand,
[1675.16 → 1678.16] let me feel my soul, and help me with the grace that comes from your hand,
[1678.16 → 1679.16] let me feel my soul, and help me with the grace that comes from your hand.
[1679.16 → 1685.16] Good morning and Happy Thanksgiving everyone.

[2095.24 → 2096.02] You could fly?
[2096.30 → 2096.82] Yeah!
[2097.08 → 2102.34] And one day, when I was flying, I saw some trouble.
[2102.74 → 2103.38] Oh, really?
[2103.56 → 2104.16] Some trouble?
[2104.56 → 2104.98] Mm-hmm!
[2105.38 → 2107.92] And Super Hank needed to save the day!
[2108.32 → 2109.50] What did you have to do?
[2109.88 → 2114.58] Well, there was a giant pizza rolling down the hill to the dog park, and it was about to
[2114.58 → 2116.14] crush all the dog toys!
[2116.58 → 2119.38] So I had to fly in, and guess what I did?
[2119.86 → 2120.26] What?
[2121.68 → 2122.20] Nope!
[2122.50 → 2123.42] My mouth!
[2124.28 → 2125.46] I just ate it!
[2125.46 → 2129.20] And I ate the whole pizza, and the world was saved!
[2129.42 → 2130.60] Or at least the dog toys!
[2130.82 → 2132.28] Oh, that's a pretty cool dream, Hank!
[2132.60 → 2133.02] Yeah!
[2133.02 → 2136.12] Well, what do you think that dream means?
[2139.88 → 2140.28] Hmm?
[2142.28 → 2142.68] Oh!
[2143.76 → 2144.96] Is that what we're doing today?
[2145.12 → 2145.32] Yeah!
[2145.44 → 2147.46] We're going to talk about Joseph's dream today!
[2147.78 → 2149.38] The segue worked so perfect!
[2152.06 → 2153.30] What's his dream about?
[2153.30 → 2155.92] Well, we're going to talk about it in children's worship time today!
[2156.00 → 2156.64] Does that sound fun?
[2157.22 → 2157.50] Yeah?
[2158.30 → 2160.52] Why don't you tell us in the back room when we get back there, okay?
[2161.04 → 2162.34] That sounds like a good plan!
[2163.06 → 2163.60] High five!
[2164.48 → 2164.88] All right!
[2164.98 → 2167.94] So what we're going to do now is we're going to pray, and then we're going to do the kids'
[2168.02 → 2170.80] blessing, and then we're going to go back to the children's worship time room, okay?
[2171.30 → 2172.52] Let's all bow our heads and pray!
[2173.58 → 2175.38] Father God, we thank you so much for this day!
[2175.50 → 2178.56] Thank you that we could be here in church today, and that we could learn so much more
[2178.56 → 2178.96] about you!
[2179.02 → 2182.44] We pray that you'll be with us as we go to children's worship time, and for the grown-ups
[2182.44 → 2187.56] who stay here as well, we pray that we will just come to know you and each other a little
[2187.56 → 2188.44] bit better in your name!
[2188.82 → 2189.14] Amen!
[2189.86 → 2190.16] All right!
[2190.20 → 2192.16] Before we run off, we're going to stand up!
[2192.30 → 2192.42] Oh!
[2193.10 → 2193.84] We're going to stand up!
[2193.96 → 2196.80] We're going to put our hands out, and then together...
[2196.80 → 2198.70] I absolutely can do that!
[2198.70 → 2201.60] We're going to say together, the Lord be with you, okay?
[2201.76 → 2205.24] So we're going to face the church like this, yeah, and then we're going to put our hands
[2205.24 → 2207.16] out, and we're going to say, the Lord be with you on the count of three.
[2207.22 → 2207.82] Are you ready, kids?
[2207.92 → 2209.08] One, two, three.
[2209.58 → 2211.22] The Lord be with you!
[2215.44 → 2218.54] Okay, you want to come with me?
[2228.70 → 2252.22] Good morning.
[2252.22 → 2255.52] My name is Clary.
[2255.64 → 2263.26] I'm an elder here at Emmanuel, and I would like to lead you as best I can through family
[2263.26 → 2263.80] prayer.
[2264.78 → 2265.86] So, let's pray.
[2266.90 → 2280.20] Thank you, Lord, that we can be here today and partake in such a profound blessing of corporate
[2280.20 → 2286.78] worship and drawing together to praise your name, but also, I think, what a lot of us find
[2286.78 → 2291.18] a profound mystery that's sometimes incomprehensible.
[2294.44 → 2303.18] It's just us, music and words, and invisibly we are nourished by you.
[2303.18 → 2312.76] And I suppose for most of the world that has not, or most of those people who haven't encountered
[2312.76 → 2319.20] you, this may look odd, but so be it.
[2320.00 → 2322.50] We are a peculiar people, as you've called us.
[2322.50 → 2331.72] So, today, we ask that we may be fed by your word and by your spirit, and that we may cling
[2331.72 → 2335.68] to your promises and your assurance.
[2337.86 → 2342.98] And I know for me, one of the great mysteries of worshipping is praying.
[2343.54 → 2346.24] I frankly don't quite understand how it works.
[2346.24 → 2353.80] And there's probably a few of us gathered here, too, who wonder how you can hear all
[2353.80 → 2361.56] of us, some of us quite focused, many of us distracted, and then a whole planet of people.
[2363.40 → 2368.72] But it's not ours to understand exactly how all things work.
[2368.72 → 2376.84] So, Father, will you hear our prayers and attend to the concerns in our hearts, particularly,
[2377.06 → 2379.72] Lord, those of us who struggle with it.
[2394.90 → 2395.38] Doubt.
[2398.72 → 2423.16] We hear our prayers for the people in our community.
[2423.16 → 2429.00] We think of Neil and Linda Rook.
[2429.76 → 2431.66] Linda's mother died last week.
[2432.44 → 2437.30] Will you be with them in their grief?
[2439.52 → 2447.76] We thank you for a successful surgery for Rich, as she had hip surgery.
[2447.76 → 2453.92] We continue to give her strength and healing.
[2455.60 → 2458.82] We've got elections coming up here in British Columbia.
[2460.04 → 2462.68] We thank you for this gift.
[2462.68 → 2467.46] We thank you for the opportunity to help us to be very critical.
[2467.46 → 2476.48] We thank you for the opportunity to help us to be very critical or doubtful.
[2476.48 → 2488.34] But help us to be so grateful that we have the opportunity to partake in leadership here and
[2488.34 → 2491.68] for all of those who are running for elected office.
[2491.68 → 2494.94] And for all of us, we ask for a full measure of wisdom.
[2494.94 → 2501.50] Mark and Deidre Lingering's sister-in-law has cancer.
[2501.50 → 2507.74] And it sounds like this diagnosis is serious.
[2507.74 → 2511.32] We ask that you will grant healing and grant strength.
[2511.32 → 2519.06] There are many people in our church family who are unable to be here and to join us.
[2520.50 → 2528.52] We ask that your spirit may attend to them and that we don't forget them and that we are
[2528.52 → 2529.48] able to reach out.
[2533.26 → 2538.18] Will you be with all of our university students and our school students and our homeschooling
[2538.18 → 2538.60] students?
[2538.60 → 2541.28] And that's a big ask.
[2541.28 → 2547.22] But there are so many young people who are working hard every day.
[2547.22 → 2556.18] We ask that they may seek first to know you and to take their gifts and talents and offer
[2556.18 → 2563.14] them to you through their learning as a sacrifice of love.
[2563.14 → 2568.58] We don't have to look very far around us to see many people in this congregation.
[2568.58 → 2573.58] who have lost loved ones, some recently and some decades ago.
[2574.26 → 2581.12] For all of those, those of us who grieve, provide a full measure of your spirit.
[2581.12 → 2587.80] We have wars and rumours of war that continue to rage around the world.
[2587.80 → 2589.74] This is nothing new.
[2589.74 → 2592.42] But we ask that peace may prevail.
[2592.42 → 2600.36] And for all of those people of great power and influence who are known and may be influential
[2600.36 → 2601.36] behind the scenes.
[2601.36 → 2604.42] May they seek peace.
[2604.42 → 2618.10] And finally, we want to give you thanks for love and how that has manifested in our congregation
[2618.10 → 2619.10] and marriage.
[2619.10 → 2620.10] We've got a couple of anniversaries.
[2620.10 → 2624.10] Bill and Mary and De Winter are celebrating their 45th.
[2624.10 → 2628.10] And then Paul and Leslie Kohl are celebrating their 40th.
[2628.10 → 2630.10] Thank you for the testimony of this faithfulness.
[2630.10 → 2643.10] And may we all be grateful to you for how your love for us can be shown through marriage.
[2643.10 → 2645.10] Amen.
[2645.10 → 2645.40] Amen.
[2660.10 → 2679.78] This morning, as we reflect on Thanksgiving, I'm mindful of the fact, as Clary prayed for
[2679.78 → 2683.36] us, that Christians are intended to be a peculiar people.
[2683.36 → 2691.12] And then on Thanksgiving weekend, we kind of do the same thing that everyone else does.
[2691.12 → 2697.78] And so I wonder, how can we think of Thanksgiving differently?
[2697.78 → 2704.02] And what does what I'm going to call real Thanksgiving perhaps look like?
[2704.02 → 2709.38] And so to help us address that and to hopefully open our eyes to these realities, we're going
[2709.38 → 2713.14] to read from 1 Timothy 2.
[2713.14 → 2715.94] I'm going to read the first seven verses.
[2715.94 → 2719.00] The first time through, it will be on the screen behind me overhead.
[2719.00 → 2724.24] But as always, I encourage you to open the Bible you brought or on your device, however
[2724.24 → 2727.14] it is that you read the Bible.
[2727.14 → 2731.62] If you would like one, there are some at the back that are available to you as well.
[2731.62 → 2736.24] And then just keep that open as we go through our time together this morning.
[2736.24 → 2741.00] So let me read from 1 Timothy 2, starting at verse 1.
[2741.00 → 2742.00] 1 Timothy 3, starting at verse 1.
[2742.00 → 2749.36] I urge, then, first, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgiving be
[2749.36 → 2755.38] made for all people, for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and
[2755.38 → 2758.62] quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.
[2758.62 → 2766.64] This is good and pleases God, our Saviour, who wants all people to be saved and to come to
[2766.64 → 2768.02] a knowledge of the truth.
[2768.02 → 2776.36] For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, who
[2776.36 → 2778.80] gave himself as a ransom for all people.
[2779.90 → 2782.98] And this has now been witnessed at the proper time.
[2783.34 → 2787.48] And for this purpose, I was appointed a herald and an apostle.
[2787.76 → 2788.86] I am telling the truth.
[2788.96 → 2789.78] I am not lying.
[2790.16 → 2793.64] And a true and faithful teacher of the Gentiles.
[2794.30 → 2795.58] This is the word of the Lord.
[2798.02 → 2807.18] So what I want to suggest to you this morning, and what I hope right out the gate shows you
[2807.18 → 2813.70] the distinction between a real, genuine, authentic Christian approach to Thanksgiving and what
[2813.70 → 2816.52] might be a more cultural one, is this idea.
[2816.52 → 2823.82] Real Thanksgiving starts with God and changes reality.
[2825.56 → 2830.80] Real Thanksgiving starts with God and changes reality.
[2832.68 → 2841.90] Now in the letter that we read, verse 1, starts with an urging based on what came before.
[2841.90 → 2845.14] That's what it means when we read, I urge then.
[2846.26 → 2852.46] And that urging, there are two things really that are there that Paul, who wrote this letter,
[2852.66 → 2857.94] is basing his urging of Timothy, who receives this letter, on.
[2858.78 → 2866.74] Paul urges Timothy to pray for all people because Paul has seen the impact of God's action
[2866.74 → 2873.14] and mercy in his life, and he wants the same new reality for everyone.
[2874.82 → 2879.64] And so already, right away, we're beginning to see that prayer is a mission activity.
[2879.84 → 2883.58] Prayer is the first mission activity of the church.
[2884.72 → 2886.34] Listen to Paul's own testimony.
[2886.48 → 2889.68] This comes from chapter 1, if your Bibles are open, in verse 12.
[2889.68 → 2891.34] Paul says,
[2891.34 → 2897.42] I thank Christ Jesus, our Lord, who has given me strength, that he considered me trustworthy,
[2897.88 → 2905.08] appointing me to his service, even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man.
[2905.08 → 2908.52] I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief.
[2908.96 → 2917.68] The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
[2917.68 → 2922.10] Now, if you're unfamiliar with Paul's story,
[2922.94 → 2927.70] Paul kind of starts out as a Jewish Pharisee.
[2928.34 → 2935.76] A Pharisee in the Jewish system is someone who focuses very strictly and intently on the law of Moses
[2935.76 → 2939.14] and teaches others to do the same.
[2939.14 → 2948.06] In fact, Paul was being trained to be the next great Pharisee.
[2949.18 → 2951.16] And when the Christian church first started,
[2951.84 → 2958.02] Paul was a lead persecutor and hunter-killer of the followers of Jesus.
[2958.98 → 2962.44] He even boasted about how good he was at his job.
[2962.44 → 2967.94] But then, one day, while he was travelling to Damascus to go route out Christians there,
[2968.28 → 2973.28] he was met on the road by the resurrected and ascended Jesus while travelling.
[2973.28 → 2979.50] And he has a vision of Jesus, and he's told to go ahead to the city and wait for a man to arrive.
[2979.50 → 2986.34] And while that's happening, there's a man in Damascus named Ananias who also has a vision,
[2986.70 → 2990.66] and he's told to go to Judas' house where he will find Paul.
[2991.60 → 2994.42] Of course, Ananias is terrified because he's heard the rumours of Paul,
[2994.52 → 2997.30] but he goes anyway because when the Lord commands, you go.
[2998.26 → 3003.56] And then, while they meet, Paul is taught by Ananias and the other disciples in Damascus,
[3003.56 → 3007.38] and then he begins to preach powerfully for Jesus.
[3007.82 → 3010.36] His life is totally transformed.
[3010.58 → 3014.88] And again, if you know the story, he goes all over the then-known world,
[3014.88 → 3018.20] and he preaches powerfully for the gospel.
[3018.20 → 3023.58] And the church grows exponentially from that point forward.
[3024.70 → 3028.86] And even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man,
[3028.96 → 3033.06] the grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, he says.
[3033.56 → 3037.72] Along with faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
[3038.72 → 3042.88] Part of why we pray, part of why we give thanks,
[3043.02 → 3046.12] is because of what God has done in our lives,
[3046.16 → 3050.40] and because we want that in the lives of everyone around us.
[3051.42 → 3053.16] And again, we read this.
[3053.24 → 3056.42] Paul makes this point in verse 16 of chapter 1.
[3058.34 → 3061.52] Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners,
[3061.52 → 3063.90] of whom I am the worst, he says.
[3064.48 → 3066.96] But for that very reason, I was shown mercy,
[3066.96 → 3070.54] so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ might be displayed.
[3070.98 → 3074.64] Christ might display his immense patience as an example for those
[3074.64 → 3078.22] who believe in him and who receive eternal life.
[3079.36 → 3082.16] Jesus came to save sinners.
[3082.42 → 3083.46] We are sinners.
[3083.62 → 3086.68] And because we are sinners, he has shown us mercy.
[3086.68 → 3090.12] And because he shows us mercy, we receive from him eternal life
[3090.12 → 3092.10] if we believe in the truth of who he is.
[3092.46 → 3095.82] And then, quite simply, when we believe that and have received that,
[3095.90 → 3097.48] we want that for everyone.
[3098.60 → 3099.70] That's why we pray.
[3099.86 → 3101.46] That's why we give thanks.
[3102.96 → 3108.12] Now, the second reason behind Paul's urging prayer and thanksgiving
[3108.12 → 3114.50] is actually to protect and to guard those who believe.
[3116.04 → 3116.18] Right?
[3116.24 → 3119.78] And so, again, in verse 18 to 20 of chapter 1,
[3120.52 → 3121.20] Paul writes,
[3121.20 → 3145.64] The command referred to here is the command to instruct certain people
[3145.64 → 3148.92] against false and bad teaching.
[3148.92 → 3154.78] A command that Paul says comes from the goal of love
[3154.78 → 3158.50] and from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.
[3159.30 → 3159.40] Right?
[3159.44 → 3164.12] The point is, Christians, and now specifically and especially Christian leaders,
[3164.96 → 3167.98] have the responsibility to teach true faith
[3167.98 → 3171.20] and to live that true faith with a clear conscience
[3171.20 → 3175.10] in order to protect others from falling away,
[3175.10 → 3178.80] from falling out of faith and into sin.
[3178.92 → 3184.46] And so, the petitions and prayers, intercessions and thanksgiving
[3184.46 → 3187.50] that we are called to make for all people
[3187.50 → 3191.56] centre around their seeing God at work,
[3191.98 → 3195.24] centre around their conversion to the truth of the gospel
[3195.24 → 3199.96] and being captivated by the beauty of God revealed in the word.
[3199.96 → 3205.50] And it centres around protecting those who believe from walking away.
[3205.50 → 3213.16] Now, some of us are here this morning because it's Thanksgiving weekend
[3213.16 → 3215.64] and someone in your family said,
[3215.78 → 3217.90] Hey, it'd be really nice if you came to church with us.
[3217.90 → 3225.68] And if that's you, I want you to hear that you, right now, are being prayed for.
[3228.82 → 3231.48] That you, right now, are loved.
[3231.48 → 3242.06] And our prayer and that love is hopefully showing something of the majesty of God to you this morning.
[3242.06 → 3245.96] And I plead with you, don't miss it.
[3247.02 → 3248.28] Don't miss his love.
[3248.94 → 3253.58] Don't miss the love that brought you here in order for you to hear.
[3256.24 → 3257.86] And then for all of us,
[3259.30 → 3261.34] whether it's today or tomorrow,
[3261.98 → 3263.82] or retroactively if it was yesterday,
[3264.98 → 3268.86] when you gather together with family and friends to celebrate Thanksgiving,
[3268.86 → 3271.22] in whatever that looks like for you,
[3271.44 → 3274.06] maybe it's turkey, maybe it's Chinese food,
[3275.02 → 3280.40] when the conversation turns to matters of life and faith,
[3280.48 → 3284.92] when the conversation turns to matters of religion or politics,
[3285.96 → 3286.48] remember,
[3287.48 → 3291.50] the goal of this command, Paul writes,
[3291.96 → 3292.84] is love.
[3292.84 → 3299.08] So however you talk to the people that you're sharing mashed potatoes with,
[3300.12 → 3302.30] I pray that it's dripping with love.
[3304.12 → 3306.70] However you pass the spring rolls down the road,
[3306.78 → 3309.50] I pray that love is seen, and it's evident to all.
[3310.84 → 3312.38] And so watch your anger.
[3313.82 → 3315.06] Mitigate your cynicism.
[3315.82 → 3318.30] Season everything you do with love.
[3318.30 → 3321.04] And yes, of course,
[3321.40 → 3324.40] the conversations that you have to have might be hard.
[3325.48 → 3329.80] And you may be in a circumstance or in a kind of familial dynamic
[3329.80 → 3334.04] where you discern that you must protect people from bad ideas
[3334.04 → 3336.70] or from hollow and deceptive philosophies.
[3337.20 → 3339.76] Today may be the day for a hard conversation.
[3341.78 → 3343.04] But if it's going to be,
[3344.14 → 3345.76] will you, like Paul,
[3346.82 → 3348.18] commit to praying for it?
[3348.54 → 3348.86] First.
[3350.38 → 3352.26] Will you pray the way Paul does
[3352.26 → 3354.10] before that happens?
[3354.84 → 3357.32] And will you enter into that conversation
[3357.32 → 3359.28] not with the idea to win,
[3360.20 → 3362.98] but with the same goals that Paul gives us
[3362.98 → 3364.56] in our Thanksgiving?
[3364.68 → 3365.66] Look at the text again.
[3367.14 → 3369.16] Paul begins with this urging
[3369.16 → 3373.82] based on his need to protect people in the truth
[3373.82 → 3376.38] and because his desire is that all might know
[3376.38 → 3377.78] Jesus who saved him,
[3377.78 → 3381.02] he gives us these four words for prayer.
[3381.74 → 3386.52] Now, I don't want to make too much of the particular words in our midst
[3386.52 → 3388.68] because they are somewhat synonymous.
[3388.84 → 3389.52] And what I mean by that is
[3389.52 → 3391.18] at different times in the Bible,
[3391.40 → 3393.32] all of these words are used
[3393.32 → 3395.58] to refer to prayer sort of generally.
[3395.58 → 3399.54] But the reason that they're given here in a list,
[3400.54 → 3404.48] right, indicates to me that there's something particular
[3404.48 → 3407.70] about each one that I think Paul wants us to hear.
[3407.70 → 3409.16] Right?
[3409.20 → 3411.70] And so this idea of petition and of prayer
[3411.70 → 3414.52] and of intercession and of a word of thanks.
[3415.40 → 3417.78] I don't think these are just synonyms.
[3418.08 → 3421.10] I think there's a point that's behind these four words
[3421.10 → 3424.40] and that's why they're being urged in the manner that they are.
[3424.40 → 3426.76] And in some ways, I think there's a movement
[3426.76 → 3429.56] that shapes all of our prayers.
[3430.56 → 3431.28] Right?
[3431.32 → 3435.78] And so we make specific requests for needs.
[3436.42 → 3437.14] Right?
[3437.22 → 3438.10] These petitions.
[3438.64 → 3441.42] We bring those specific requests
[3441.42 → 3444.22] and the needs of the people who have them
[3444.22 → 3446.94] into view before God.
[3447.78 → 3450.42] And we boldly appeal on their behalf.
[3451.28 → 3454.06] And then we give thanks to God for them
[3454.06 → 3457.36] and for whatever it is that he may be doing at this moment.
[3458.06 → 3461.28] In short, when you think of praying this weekend
[3461.28 → 3463.12] and before these gatherings,
[3463.34 → 3464.86] I want you to be specific,
[3465.40 → 3466.28] be particular,
[3466.92 → 3467.74] be bold,
[3467.94 → 3469.12] and be grateful.
[3469.12 → 3470.28] Right?
[3471.50 → 3472.22] Be specific.
[3472.46 → 3473.28] And what I mean by that is
[3473.28 → 3476.68] tell God exactly what you are petitioning him for.
[3479.36 → 3480.16] Right?
[3480.20 → 3480.98] Instead of praying,
[3481.52 → 3483.08] please bring healing,
[3484.12 → 3485.26] maybe you pray,
[3486.10 → 3486.54] God,
[3487.12 → 3489.74] end this liver cancer.
[3490.84 → 3492.40] Be specific.
[3494.82 → 3495.06] Right?
[3495.08 → 3496.58] And then be particular.
[3497.68 → 3497.92] Right?
[3497.92 → 3498.22] That is,
[3498.46 → 3501.88] name exactly who you are praying for.
[3503.54 → 3503.90] Right?
[3504.04 → 3507.08] End this liver cancer for John.
[3508.16 → 3510.08] I tried to pick a really generic name there.
[3510.40 → 3511.72] If there's a John here with liver cancer,
[3511.84 → 3513.70] I apologize for outing you in that way.
[3514.32 → 3515.16] But then I don't.
[3515.20 → 3516.14] Because I want to pray for you.
[3516.82 → 3517.24] You get it?
[3517.26 → 3518.08] You see how this is working?
[3519.66 → 3520.02] All right,
[3520.02 → 3520.64] be specific,
[3520.78 → 3521.32] be particular,
[3521.44 → 3522.28] and be bold.
[3522.28 → 3524.36] Imagine when you're praying
[3524.36 → 3525.44] that what you're doing
[3525.44 → 3526.64] is actually talking
[3526.64 → 3528.66] to the Lord of the universe.
[3529.54 → 3530.84] And you're asking him
[3530.84 → 3531.44] to intercede
[3531.96 → 3534.14] in a way that only he can.
[3536.14 → 3538.94] Be bold in your praying.
[3540.34 → 3541.40] And then finally,
[3542.24 → 3543.02] be grateful.
[3544.12 → 3544.36] Right?
[3544.48 → 3547.34] Give Thanksgiving to God.
[3547.34 → 3550.18] Have gratitude to God
[3550.18 → 3552.20] for what he has already done
[3552.20 → 3554.34] and what he will do
[3554.34 → 3555.70] because in your praying
[3555.70 → 3556.78] you have been specific
[3556.78 → 3558.50] and particular and bold.
[3559.28 → 3560.28] Be specific.
[3560.78 → 3561.40] Be particular.
[3561.64 → 3562.16] Be bold.
[3562.32 → 3563.48] And be grateful.
[3564.62 → 3565.54] And can I tell you something?
[3565.54 → 3569.74] It's really hard.
[3569.98 → 3571.36] It's really hard
[3571.36 → 3572.62] to be anxious
[3572.62 → 3575.18] when you are choosing
[3575.18 → 3576.44] to focus on your gratitude.
[3578.62 → 3580.78] Gratitude pushes out worry.
[3582.50 → 3583.56] Gratitude flows
[3583.56 → 3585.10] from meeting God
[3585.10 → 3586.00] in the throne room
[3586.00 → 3586.62] of his grace
[3586.62 → 3587.64] and of his mercy
[3587.64 → 3588.26] in the temple
[3588.26 → 3589.44] of his worship.
[3590.22 → 3591.38] And when you are standing
[3591.38 → 3592.18] in the presence
[3592.18 → 3593.56] of the glory of God,
[3593.88 → 3595.36] all of a sudden,
[3595.54 → 3596.94] those things
[3596.94 → 3597.92] that give us worry
[3597.92 → 3602.04] seem to be minimized
[3602.04 → 3603.90] in the majesty
[3603.90 → 3605.58] of who he is.
[3607.50 → 3608.44] Thanksgiving,
[3609.12 → 3610.02] gratitude,
[3610.84 → 3612.18] is truly
[3612.18 → 3614.82] a Christian reality.
[3616.00 → 3616.68] And Thanksgiving
[3616.68 → 3618.00] ought to be
[3618.00 → 3619.86] our default posture
[3619.86 → 3621.28] because Thanksgiving
[3621.28 → 3622.68] is worship.
[3623.92 → 3624.30] Thanksgiving,
[3624.68 → 3625.00] honestly,
[3625.00 → 3626.02] is the only
[3626.02 → 3627.68] logical and normal
[3627.68 → 3628.28] response
[3628.28 → 3629.70] to meeting God,
[3629.80 → 3630.96] to being met by God,
[3631.04 → 3631.82] to learning the truth
[3631.82 → 3633.20] of whom this God is
[3633.20 → 3634.14] and to seeing
[3634.14 → 3634.80] and receiving
[3634.80 → 3635.58] his grace.
[3636.68 → 3636.78] Right?
[3636.82 → 3638.64] Gratitude follows grace.
[3641.34 → 3641.56] Now,
[3641.92 → 3643.34] with your patience,
[3643.74 → 3644.88] I'm going to get a little
[3644.88 → 3646.08] philosophical
[3646.08 → 3647.28] for a moment
[3647.28 → 3647.74] and so
[3647.74 → 3649.66] endure with me
[3649.66 → 3650.12] in this.
[3650.12 → 3652.74] if you separate
[3652.74 → 3653.72] your Thanksgiving
[3653.72 → 3654.44] from God,
[3655.54 → 3656.12] that is,
[3656.20 → 3656.38] right,
[3656.62 → 3657.44] for everyone
[3657.44 → 3658.34] who celebrates
[3658.34 → 3658.90] thanksgiving
[3658.90 → 3659.74] as purely
[3659.74 → 3660.52] a cultural
[3660.52 → 3661.76] or historical
[3661.76 → 3662.44] phenomenon,
[3663.14 → 3664.68] if you separate
[3664.68 → 3665.48] your Thanksgiving
[3665.48 → 3666.22] from God,
[3666.34 → 3667.24] you're actually
[3667.24 → 3668.00] missing
[3668.00 → 3668.98] the fullness
[3668.98 → 3670.36] of what gratitude
[3670.36 → 3671.22] can be.
[3672.80 → 3673.52] Right?
[3673.52 → 3674.36] To be thankful
[3674.36 → 3675.60] genuinely,
[3675.80 → 3676.70] or generally,
[3676.94 → 3677.54] to be thankful
[3677.54 → 3678.86] generally,
[3679.08 → 3680.04] even though I'm sure
[3680.04 → 3680.90] it is absolutely
[3680.90 → 3681.50] genuine,
[3682.50 → 3683.70] to be thankful
[3683.70 → 3684.64] generally
[3684.64 → 3685.96] is to be thankful
[3685.96 → 3688.42] only nebulously.
[3690.80 → 3691.40] Right?
[3691.40 → 3692.02] when there's no
[3692.02 → 3693.42] real or right
[3693.42 → 3694.52] or transcendent
[3694.52 → 3695.86] object of our
[3695.86 → 3696.32] gratitude
[3696.32 → 3697.48] or recipient
[3697.48 → 3698.56] of our worship,
[3698.56 → 3699.64] it's ultimately
[3699.64 → 3700.54] incomplete.
[3702.40 → 3702.96] Or,
[3703.18 → 3704.22] and more likely
[3704.22 → 3705.66] for many of us
[3705.66 → 3706.18] here this morning
[3706.18 → 3707.04] more accurately,
[3707.72 → 3709.38] when we try
[3709.38 → 3710.36] to locate
[3710.36 → 3711.36] the object
[3711.36 → 3712.58] of our Thanksgiving
[3712.58 → 3713.44] in something
[3713.44 → 3714.70] less than
[3714.70 → 3715.24] the God
[3715.24 → 3715.96] of the universe,
[3716.26 → 3717.08] the feeling
[3717.08 → 3718.00] of gratitude
[3718.00 → 3719.22] and that comfort
[3719.22 → 3720.24] that comes from
[3720.24 → 3720.96] gratitude
[3720.96 → 3722.60] is as fleeting
[3722.60 → 3723.60] as the thing
[3723.60 → 3724.00] that you're
[3724.00 → 3724.66] thankful for.
[3727.68 → 3728.96] And so last year,
[3729.10 → 3730.74] you were thankful
[3730.74 → 3731.40] for health,
[3732.40 → 3733.72] but this year,
[3733.80 → 3734.30] you have a terminal
[3734.30 → 3734.82] diagnosis.
[3736.28 → 3737.22] What does that mean?
[3738.14 → 3738.74] Last year,
[3738.80 → 3739.32] you were thankful
[3739.32 → 3740.06] for your boyfriend
[3740.06 → 3741.08] or for your girlfriend.
[3741.40 → 3741.82] This year,
[3741.90 → 3742.52] you've broken up.
[3744.54 → 3745.24] Last year,
[3745.32 → 3745.90] you were thankful
[3745.90 → 3746.98] for your great job.
[3747.28 → 3747.66] This year,
[3747.72 → 3748.48] you've been laid off.
[3749.68 → 3750.36] Last year,
[3750.36 → 3751.00] you were thankful
[3751.00 → 3751.60] for deep
[3751.60 → 3753.02] and long-lasting
[3753.02 → 3753.84] relationships,
[3754.18 → 3754.80] and this year,
[3754.88 → 3755.28] their spot
[3755.28 → 3755.76] at the table
[3755.76 → 3756.26] is empty.
[3759.18 → 3759.86] And don't hear
[3759.86 → 3760.48] what I'm not saying.
[3760.54 → 3761.46] It's not that we can't
[3761.46 → 3762.00] or shouldn't
[3762.00 → 3762.56] be thankful
[3762.56 → 3763.44] for those things
[3763.44 → 3764.34] when they come.
[3764.40 → 3765.44] We absolutely should,
[3765.70 → 3767.50] especially when we realize
[3767.50 → 3768.52] just how fragile
[3768.52 → 3770.12] some of those things are.
[3771.00 → 3772.16] But if we made,
[3772.28 → 3773.04] if we have made
[3773.04 → 3774.18] more of them,
[3774.24 → 3775.14] if we've made them
[3775.14 → 3776.46] into the thing,
[3776.46 → 3777.44] if we've tied
[3777.44 → 3778.28] our sense of meaning
[3778.28 → 3779.58] or our sense of purpose
[3779.58 → 3780.28] or identity
[3780.28 → 3781.70] or our experience
[3781.70 → 3782.50] of full joy
[3782.50 → 3783.86] to those particular things,
[3783.98 → 3785.12] we will always,
[3785.36 → 3785.80] in the end,
[3785.88 → 3786.68] be disappointed.
[3787.64 → 3788.62] They can't handle
[3788.62 → 3789.62] the weight of that.
[3790.68 → 3791.66] That kind of weight
[3791.66 → 3793.00] can only be handled
[3793.00 → 3794.36] by God.
[3796.68 → 3797.08] Now,
[3797.10 → 3797.54] did you know
[3797.54 → 3799.44] that in the Old Testament,
[3799.66 → 3800.14] in the Hebrew,
[3800.56 → 3801.76] the word that's translated
[3801.76 → 3802.14] weight
[3802.14 → 3803.00] or weighty
[3803.00 → 3803.62] or heavy
[3803.62 → 3805.12] is also,
[3805.26 → 3806.02] when talking about God,
[3806.18 → 3807.56] translated glory.
[3810.12 → 3810.36] Right?
[3810.40 → 3811.78] When we glory
[3811.78 → 3813.56] in the lesser things,
[3813.72 → 3814.54] they will fail.
[3815.08 → 3816.22] But when we glory
[3816.22 → 3816.96] in God,
[3817.14 → 3818.32] the lesser things
[3818.32 → 3819.46] have more value.
[3820.70 → 3821.88] That's what gratitude
[3821.88 → 3823.88] to God does,
[3823.94 → 3824.58] what gratitude
[3824.58 → 3826.56] for God does.
[3826.66 → 3827.50] It helps us
[3827.50 → 3829.56] order reality well.
[3829.56 → 3830.48] It helps us order
[3830.48 → 3831.56] our glories
[3831.56 → 3833.22] well and properly.
[3833.62 → 3835.44] Now,
[3835.50 → 3836.12] that means
[3836.12 → 3837.48] Thanksgiving
[3837.48 → 3838.70] without God
[3838.70 → 3839.84] is an improper
[3839.84 → 3840.46] ordering
[3840.46 → 3841.74] of reality.
[3842.64 → 3842.96] Thanksgiving
[3842.96 → 3843.90] without God
[3843.90 → 3844.98] is an inadequate,
[3845.56 → 3846.30] incomplete
[3846.30 → 3847.26] understanding
[3847.26 → 3848.52] of reality.
[3849.36 → 3850.12] That's why
[3850.12 → 3850.84] we are thankful.
[3851.32 → 3851.78] That's why
[3851.78 → 3852.44] we pray.
[3853.36 → 3853.48] Right?
[3853.54 → 3854.18] Because both
[3854.18 → 3854.82] of these things
[3854.82 → 3855.98] help us properly
[3855.98 → 3857.78] define reality,
[3858.02 → 3859.36] recognizing God
[3859.36 → 3859.98] at the top.
[3860.14 → 3860.68] And not just
[3860.68 → 3861.18] at the top
[3861.18 → 3862.34] in the hierarchy
[3862.34 → 3863.50] of being sense,
[3863.50 → 3864.58] but at the top
[3864.58 → 3865.66] is a holy other,
[3865.82 → 3867.58] utterly transcendent,
[3867.72 → 3869.32] absolutely holy
[3869.32 → 3870.18] and set apart.
[3870.48 → 3871.16] The creator
[3871.16 → 3872.54] stands apart
[3872.54 → 3874.32] from his creation.
[3875.48 → 3875.60] Now,
[3875.62 → 3875.98] what I hope
[3875.98 → 3876.64] you're seeing
[3876.64 → 3877.16] is that
[3877.16 → 3878.32] right Thanksgiving
[3878.32 → 3880.32] has an ontological
[3880.32 → 3881.02] impact.
[3881.50 → 3882.06] That is,
[3882.12 → 3882.84] you make sense
[3882.84 → 3883.56] of the world
[3883.56 → 3884.16] properly
[3884.16 → 3885.94] when it's rooted
[3885.94 → 3886.84] in right Thanksgiving.
[3886.84 → 3888.66] Now,
[3888.68 → 3889.64] the amazing thing
[3889.64 → 3890.42] about this
[3890.42 → 3891.36] right understanding
[3891.36 → 3892.46] of who God is
[3892.46 → 3893.10] is that
[3893.10 → 3894.20] even though,
[3894.30 → 3894.66] and perhaps
[3894.66 → 3895.62] especially because,
[3896.02 → 3896.60] even though
[3896.60 → 3898.16] he is wholly other,
[3898.74 → 3899.32] this God
[3899.32 → 3900.84] came into the world
[3900.84 → 3901.84] that he created
[3901.84 → 3902.68] to save us.
[3903.26 → 3903.98] What does Paul say?
[3904.22 → 3905.38] For there is one God
[3905.38 → 3906.34] and one mediator
[3906.34 → 3907.16] between God
[3907.16 → 3907.72] and mankind,
[3908.36 → 3908.98] the man
[3908.98 → 3910.14] Christ Jesus
[3910.14 → 3911.48] who gave himself
[3911.48 → 3912.36] as a ransom
[3912.36 → 3914.08] for all people.
[3914.08 → 3915.12] If that doesn't
[3915.12 → 3915.96] blow your mind
[3915.96 → 3916.84] this Thanksgiving,
[3917.06 → 3917.64] you're missing
[3917.64 → 3918.24] the point.
[3919.80 → 3919.92] Right?
[3919.98 → 3921.08] The God of the universe
[3921.08 → 3922.82] who is utterly transcendent
[3922.82 → 3923.80] took on flesh
[3923.80 → 3925.04] and came into the world
[3925.04 → 3925.80] that he created.
[3927.04 → 3927.66] And not only
[3927.66 → 3928.88] did he just show up,
[3929.06 → 3930.18] he lived the life
[3930.18 → 3930.92] I should have lived.
[3931.00 → 3931.88] He died the death
[3931.88 → 3932.70] that I deserved.
[3932.78 → 3933.68] He paid the penalty
[3933.68 → 3934.92] for my sin
[3934.92 → 3935.96] and he bore
[3935.96 → 3937.02] the wrath of God
[3937.02 → 3938.84] and he won victory
[3938.84 → 3939.70] over sin
[3939.70 → 3940.38] and death
[3940.38 → 3941.38] and dying on the cross
[3941.38 → 3942.70] and three days later
[3942.70 → 3943.84] this same God
[3943.84 → 3945.10] was raised again
[3945.10 → 3945.94] from the dead.
[3946.86 → 3947.28] And after that
[3947.28 → 3948.44] he was ascended
[3948.44 → 3949.42] to the right hand
[3949.42 → 3949.90] of the Father
[3949.90 → 3950.62] where now
[3950.62 → 3951.80] at the name of Jesus
[3951.80 → 3953.00] every knee shall bow
[3953.00 → 3953.90] in heaven and on earth
[3953.90 → 3954.72] and under the earth
[3954.72 → 3955.70] that Jesus Christ
[3955.70 → 3956.98] is Lord.
[3957.38 → 3958.32] That's the root
[3958.32 → 3959.26] of our Thanksgiving.
[3961.46 → 3962.66] And when this is true
[3962.66 → 3963.54] for you
[3963.54 → 3964.28] and for me
[3964.28 → 3965.00] in our hearts
[3965.00 → 3965.96] and in our minds
[3965.96 → 3967.18] and we are transformed
[3967.18 → 3970.10] by this new creation reality
[3970.10 → 3971.70] this gospel message
[3971.70 → 3972.78] of Jesus
[3972.78 → 3974.22] that changes
[3974.22 → 3975.56] everything
[3975.56 → 3976.58] about
[3976.58 → 3977.76] our
[3977.76 → 3978.96] lives.
[3980.80 → 3982.24] Why we pray.
[3983.18 → 3984.58] What we pray for.
[3985.58 → 3986.80] The way we pray.
[3987.46 → 3989.24] The conduct we have
[3989.24 → 3989.84] in the midst
[3989.84 → 3991.12] of these
[3991.12 → 3993.20] family dinners
[3993.20 → 3995.02] around a Thanksgiving table.
[3996.28 → 3998.62] And Paul even instructs us.
[3998.62 → 3999.14] He says
[3999.14 → 4000.84] we pray
[4000.84 → 4002.58] for all people
[4002.58 → 4003.36] for kings
[4003.36 → 4004.62] and those in authority
[4004.62 → 4006.86] which means
[4006.86 → 4008.18] we pray for everyone
[4008.18 → 4009.50] in every circumstance
[4009.50 → 4011.96] that we may live
[4011.96 → 4012.88] peaceful
[4012.88 → 4014.58] and quiet lives
[4014.58 → 4015.50] in all godliness
[4015.50 → 4016.88] and holiness.
[4016.88 → 4020.04] So I want to ask you
[4020.04 → 4022.42] will your conversations
[4022.42 → 4023.34] at the Thanksgiving
[4023.34 → 4024.72] table today
[4024.72 → 4025.64] or tomorrow
[4025.64 → 4026.54] reflect
[4026.54 → 4027.82] these twin
[4027.82 → 4029.48] tandem truths?
[4030.28 → 4031.12] Right first
[4031.12 → 4032.28] that God is the one
[4032.28 → 4032.86] to whom
[4032.86 → 4034.22] we must be thankful
[4034.22 → 4036.98] and that our gratitude
[4036.98 → 4037.94] shows up
[4037.94 → 4039.24] in peaceful
[4039.24 → 4040.82] quiet lives
[4040.82 → 4041.92] of godliness
[4041.92 → 4043.12] and holiness.
[4044.38 → 4045.74] Really practically
[4045.74 → 4047.30] I'll put it this way.
[4048.22 → 4048.92] Will your niece
[4048.92 → 4049.72] go home
[4049.72 → 4050.80] after dinner
[4050.80 → 4051.32] saying
[4051.32 → 4052.30] man
[4052.30 → 4053.32] uncle
[4053.32 → 4054.68] whoever
[4054.68 → 4055.88] sure is
[4055.88 → 4056.30] peaceful
[4056.30 → 4057.00] and godly.
[4059.24 → 4060.52] Will your friend
[4060.52 → 4061.26] go home
[4061.26 → 4062.10] from dinner
[4062.10 → 4062.50] saying
[4062.50 → 4063.00] wow
[4063.00 → 4064.76] she is so calm
[4064.76 → 4065.72] and holy.
[4067.76 → 4069.08] Notice what we read.
[4069.88 → 4071.28] This is good
[4071.28 → 4072.04] and pleases
[4072.04 → 4073.08] God our Saviour
[4073.08 → 4073.82] who wants
[4073.82 → 4074.64] all people
[4074.64 → 4075.80] to be saved
[4075.80 → 4076.56] and to come
[4076.56 → 4077.26] a knowledge
[4077.26 → 4079.14] of the truth.
[4080.56 → 4081.66] Right verse 4
[4081.66 → 4082.24] God wants
[4082.24 → 4082.98] all people
[4082.98 → 4083.68] to be saved
[4083.68 → 4084.28] and to come
[4084.28 → 4085.48] to a knowledge
[4085.48 → 4086.70] of the truth.
[4087.82 → 4089.88] How you show up
[4089.88 → 4091.30] in life
[4091.30 → 4092.36] and at the
[4092.36 → 4093.22] Thanksgiving table
[4093.22 → 4094.48] right
[4094.48 → 4095.44] how you show up
[4095.44 → 4096.16] with a rightly
[4096.16 → 4098.26] ordered reality
[4098.26 → 4099.56] how you pray
[4099.56 → 4100.88] and how you present
[4100.88 → 4101.76] the truth
[4101.76 → 4103.12] all of these
[4103.12 → 4103.74] are ways
[4103.74 → 4104.26] that God
[4104.26 → 4104.96] makes himself
[4104.96 → 4105.46] known
[4105.46 → 4106.22] to a new
[4106.22 → 4106.78] generation
[4106.78 → 4108.98] and makes himself
[4108.98 → 4109.92] known to the people
[4109.92 → 4110.96] at your tables
[4110.96 → 4112.78] to the people
[4112.78 → 4113.46] in your offices
[4113.46 → 4114.64] to the people
[4114.64 → 4115.48] on your job sites
[4115.48 → 4115.98] to the people
[4115.98 → 4116.86] in your dorm rooms
[4116.86 → 4117.66] to the people
[4117.66 → 4118.60] on your sports teams.
[4120.28 → 4121.38] Have the hard
[4121.38 → 4122.30] conversations
[4122.30 → 4124.08] and be vigilant
[4124.08 → 4125.26] for the truth
[4125.26 → 4125.94] but remember
[4125.94 → 4126.96] the goal
[4126.96 → 4127.76] of this command
[4127.76 → 4128.76] is love.
[4131.12 → 4132.02] And so as you
[4132.02 → 4132.68] go into them
[4132.68 → 4133.92] be specific
[4133.92 → 4136.38] be particular
[4136.38 → 4138.18] be bold
[4138.18 → 4139.46] be grateful
[4139.46 → 4140.62] in prayer
[4140.62 → 4143.50] and as you do
[4143.50 → 4144.56] all of these
[4144.56 → 4145.58] things
[4145.58 → 4148.18] as you do
[4148.18 → 4149.04] all of
[4149.04 → 4150.24] these things
[4150.24 → 4151.22] that recognize
[4151.22 → 4152.02] that real
[4152.02 → 4152.54] Thanksgiving
[4152.54 → 4153.88] starts with God
[4153.88 → 4154.90] and changes
[4154.90 → 4156.50] our reality
[4156.50 → 4158.70] as you do
[4158.70 → 4159.72] all these things
[4159.72 → 4161.10] may your homes
[4161.10 → 4163.00] and your hearts
[4163.00 → 4164.62] be peaceful
[4164.62 → 4166.28] and quiet
[4166.28 → 4168.00] in godliness
[4168.00 → 4169.88] and holiness.
[4170.48 → 4171.08] Amen.
[4171.72 → 4172.84] Let's pray together.
[4172.84 → 4182.50] Lord of the universe
[4182.50 → 4183.76] today
[4183.76 → 4184.54] we

[4195.32 → 4196.72] in you

[4198.04 → 4201.06] open our eyes
[4201.06 → 4201.80] to the truth

[4207.68 → 4208.04] that we
[4208.04 → 4208.70] might know
[4208.70 → 4210.22] your love
[4210.22 → 4213.16] and as we
[4213.16 → 4213.80] come to the
[4213.80 → 4214.24] table
[4214.24 → 4215.98] may this
[4215.98 → 4216.48] be
[4216.48 → 4217.14] our
[4217.14 → 4217.78] true

[4219.44 → 4220.40] feast
[4220.40 → 4221.16] because may
[4221.16 → 4221.84] this be

[4227.68 → 4228.06] meet you
[4228.06 → 4228.64] here at this
[4228.64 → 4228.98] table

[4250.28 → 4251.86] in Jesus name
[4251.86 → 4253.06] Amen
[4253.06 → 4254.66] Amen
[4254.66 → 4261.00] we're going
[4261.00 → 4261.82] to come
[4261.82 → 4262.48] to the

[4263.32 → 4263.62] table
[4263.62 → 4264.10] together
[4264.10 → 4265.40] as we
[4265.40 → 4265.92] do so
[4265.92 → 4266.36] there will
[4266.36 → 4267.46] be a
[4267.46 → 4267.90] liturgy
[4267.90 → 4268.50] that we
[4268.50 → 4269.20] go through
[4269.20 → 4269.64] and that
[4269.64 → 4269.96] will have
[4269.96 → 4270.48] portions
[4270.48 → 4270.92] that you

[4271.44 → 4272.22] to speak
[4272.22 → 4273.20] they will
[4273.20 → 4274.00] be indicated
