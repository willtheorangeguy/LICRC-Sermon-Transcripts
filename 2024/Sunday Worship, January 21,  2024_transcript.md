[0.00 --> 29.98]  Thank you.
[30.00 --> 59.98]  Thank you.
[60.00 --> 89.98]  Thank you.
[90.00 --> 92.00]  Thank you.
[120.00 --> 122.00]  Thank you.
[150.00 --> 152.00]  Thank you.
[180.00 --> 182.00]  Thank you.
[210.00 --> 212.00]  Thank you.
[212.00 --> 214.00]  Thank you.
[214.00 --> 243.98]  Thank you.
[244.00 --> 273.98]  Thank you.
[274.00 --> 274.64]  What hockey game?
[277.02 --> 279.12]  Good morning, everyone.
[281.68 --> 285.16]  Good morning, everyone.
[286.00 --> 287.06]  There we go.
[287.14 --> 289.60]  Welcome to Langley Manual CRC this morning.
[289.68 --> 290.80]  My name is Kevin Lobert.
[291.00 --> 292.58]  I'm the youth pastor here.
[293.08 --> 300.08]  An extra welcome to any family and guests here to celebrate with us the baptism of Jane Hernandez.
[300.08 --> 302.10]  It's so good to see you all here as well.
[302.52 --> 308.12]  Before we get going in worship this morning, there's just a few announcements I'd like to bring to your attention.
[308.94 --> 315.98]  The first is that this Tuesday night, council will be meeting this week to chat about the end of last year and the beginning of this year.
[316.00 --> 317.30]  And we'll be rolling with that.
[317.62 --> 319.70]  So council members, we'll see you there.
[319.82 --> 321.80]  Church, just know that that's happening in the background.
[321.80 --> 325.20]  2020 is tonight for all of you youth.
[325.42 --> 330.52]  So if you are a youth or a leader here today, we'll see you tonight here at the church, 6.30 p.m.
[330.90 --> 332.34]  Looking forward to that as well.
[332.34 --> 337.20]  So finally, a third announcement for you this morning is something new.
[337.36 --> 342.16]  This week, for the first time, our church is actually going to be releasing a podcast.
[342.98 --> 347.40]  This is a project that Pastor Chris, Josh, and myself have been a little bit excited about for the last little bit.
[347.48 --> 349.50]  And we finally got rolling on it.
[349.56 --> 354.64]  And so this podcast will be talking about the previous Sunday's sermons.
[354.64 --> 358.54]  And we'll be talking about church and theology and current events and those types of things.
[358.54 --> 362.38]  And so they'll be about 30 minutes long or so, and they will come out every week.
[362.54 --> 367.22]  And so if that's something that you're interested in, the link to those will be in both the bulletin and on the website.
[367.52 --> 372.22]  But you can also download them wherever you download any of your podcasts.
[372.38 --> 373.60]  So they will be available everywhere.
[373.92 --> 375.72]  The podcast is called The Narthex.
[375.90 --> 378.70]  So give a look for that and hear more about that.
[378.92 --> 382.78]  It stars one of our dear friends as well, who's smiling at me right now.
[382.86 --> 385.00]  So see if you can figure out who that is.
[385.00 --> 393.06]  Finally, the last announcement this morning is we have a video to show you promoing a summer camp happening this summer.
[393.16 --> 394.54]  And so the video is going to play right now.
[394.94 --> 397.32]  And then Aaron Wagener and I are going to talk about that for a little bit.
[397.32 --> 397.38]  Thank you.
[415.00 --> 436.14]  It's not a family trait.
[436.14 --> 438.08]  It's nothing that I ain't.
[438.26 --> 441.96]  And it didn't come from skating with holy rotors.
[442.20 --> 444.14]  It's an early warning sign.
[444.42 --> 446.12]  It keeps my life in line.
[446.32 --> 447.98]  But it's so hard to define.
[448.24 --> 449.04]  Never mind.
[449.14 --> 450.82]  It's just a spirit thing.
[451.02 --> 452.90]  It's just a hole in touch.
[453.12 --> 456.10]  It's like a circuit judge in the brain.
[456.78 --> 458.88]  It's just a spirit thing.
[459.08 --> 460.94]  It's here to guard my heart.
[461.08 --> 464.06]  It's just a little hard to explain.
[464.06 --> 470.16]  It pushes when I quit.
[470.46 --> 472.14]  It smells like counterfeit.
[472.50 --> 475.86]  Sometimes it works a bit like a teleprompter.
[476.48 --> 478.18]  When it's teleprompter new.
[478.56 --> 480.20]  I pray you let it do.
[480.54 --> 482.20]  And I'll help you with the how.
[482.40 --> 485.04]  But for now it's just a spirit thing.
[485.22 --> 487.08]  It's just a hole in touch.
[487.08 --> 490.40]  It's like a circuit judge in the brain.
[490.92 --> 493.08]  It's just a spirit thing.
[493.26 --> 495.12]  It's here to guard my heart.
[495.30 --> 498.16]  It's just a little hard to explain.
[498.16 --> 518.40]  And you know he doesn't.
[518.40 --> 533.44]  And so as the video showed you,
[533.58 --> 535.52]  that is Cascade Family Bible Camp
[535.52 --> 537.84]  at Warm Beach down in Washington.
[537.84 --> 540.82]  It's going to take place this July, July 4 to 8.
[541.98 --> 544.08]  And Aaron's up here to talk about that.
[544.14 --> 545.64]  I'm going to hold the mic just for a little bit longer.
[545.82 --> 547.62]  We got invited out last year,
[547.62 --> 549.78]  the youth ministry, the youth leaders and I
[549.78 --> 553.52]  to lead the youth ministry at Warm Beach there last year.
[553.54 --> 554.40]  And it was so much fun.
[554.52 --> 555.50]  So we had a great time.
[555.54 --> 557.38]  Myself and four youth leaders went down.
[557.78 --> 559.76]  We met up with a few other members from this church.
[559.90 --> 560.82]  The Chepkamas were there.
[561.08 --> 561.70]  Hi, Chepkamas.
[561.98 --> 563.04]  Yeah, they were there.
[563.10 --> 563.84]  We hung out with them.
[564.12 --> 566.52]  I heard they got second place in a bocce ball tournament.
[566.52 --> 568.96]  And so if you want to try to take them on in that,
[569.28 --> 570.48]  maybe they'll be back this year.
[570.80 --> 571.86]  The Hubards were there as well.
[571.92 --> 573.54]  And there's a few others from our church as well,
[573.64 --> 574.48]  plus these wagonards.
[574.60 --> 575.94]  So it was a great time.
[575.94 --> 578.44]  I'm going to let Aaron describe it a little bit more in depth.
[578.58 --> 579.84]  But do think about coming this year.
[580.88 --> 581.52]  Good morning.
[581.74 --> 585.20]  So I've been going to KSK Family Battle Camp
[585.20 --> 586.34]  since I was about 12.
[586.80 --> 590.06]  And so my kids have not missed a year.
[590.76 --> 591.60]  So that was pretty cool.
[591.82 --> 595.52]  And I was so glad that some of the people from church
[595.52 --> 596.12]  were able to hear.
[596.28 --> 597.56]  Kevin and Nikki did a great job.
[597.92 --> 598.80]  Josh and Heather,
[599.10 --> 600.72]  and they did a great job with the youth.
[600.86 --> 603.08]  I would love to see more people from church.
[603.08 --> 606.12]  When I was a kid, it was packed.
[606.68 --> 608.62]  And Canadians were all over the place.
[608.84 --> 609.58]  And it was awesome.
[610.10 --> 611.58]  And I'd like to get that back to that point.
[611.80 --> 616.58]  There is a discount for Canadians and first-time comers.
[616.86 --> 619.76]  So I'll get Kevin that information and he can get it out.
[620.30 --> 621.48]  There's something for everyone,
[622.04 --> 627.42]  from little kids to people that have years under their belt.
[627.42 --> 629.78]  And there's bikes.
[630.06 --> 630.82]  You've got to take bikes.
[630.96 --> 632.54]  Kids are riding bikes all over the place.
[632.68 --> 635.38]  And it's just a very safe place for kids to just be kids
[635.38 --> 637.54]  and just roam free.
[637.92 --> 641.52]  And so I'd love to see people show up and have a good time.
[641.92 --> 642.28]  Thank you.
[643.34 --> 645.76]  We're going to make a little Emanuel Village there this year.
[645.82 --> 647.26]  So let's see if we can sign up in droves.
[647.26 --> 649.48]  I'm going to invite Pastor Chris forward now,
[649.62 --> 652.32]  and he is going to lead us in God's greeting this morning.
[655.92 --> 657.16]  Good morning.
[657.42 --> 658.30]  Good morning.
[658.40 --> 662.14]  Can I ask you to stand, if you are able, and where you are at?
[663.22 --> 667.20]  We gather in this place because God calls us into his presence,
[667.36 --> 669.42]  and we receive that presence.
[669.56 --> 673.28]  We mark that presence by receiving God's greeting.
[673.48 --> 676.46]  And so I invite you to open your heart, maybe even your hands,
[676.88 --> 681.16]  take on a posture to receive God's greeting in this space together.
[682.78 --> 685.82]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you.
[685.82 --> 690.02]  From God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, Son, and our Savior,
[690.44 --> 692.68]  through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[693.36 --> 694.14]  All God's people said?
[695.00 --> 695.48]  Amen.
[696.08 --> 698.38]  I'm going to invite you to turn to those around you
[698.38 --> 700.02]  and welcome them into worship.
[700.32 --> 702.52]  Please remember it's cold and flu season,
[702.70 --> 706.92]  and so not everyone wants to shake hands or hug or holy kiss or the like.
[706.92 --> 708.62]  So greet each other appropriately.
[711.62 --> 712.36]  Peace of Christ.
[712.36 --> 730.80]  Thank you.
[735.02 --> 736.04]  Thank you so much.
[736.04 --> 748.70]  Who has held the oceans in his hands?
[749.62 --> 752.24]  Who has numbered every grain of sand?
[753.48 --> 756.80]  Kings and nations tremble at his voice,
[756.80 --> 760.14]  and all creation trembles at his voice.
[761.10 --> 765.18]  Behold our God, seated on his throne,
[766.02 --> 768.04]  come let us adore him.
[768.94 --> 772.68]  Behold our King, nothing can compare,
[773.68 --> 776.62]  come let us adore him.
[777.70 --> 778.76]  Let's sing those words.
[778.76 --> 795.48]  Who has held the oceans in his hands?
[795.48 --> 801.98]  Who has numbered every grain of sand?
[802.62 --> 808.82]  Kings and nations tremble at his voice,
[808.82 --> 815.82]  all creation rises to rejoice.
[817.58 --> 824.68]  Behold our God, seated on his throne,
[825.68 --> 829.98]  come let us adore him.
[829.98 --> 837.48]  Behold our King, nothing can compare,
[837.48 --> 844.48]  come let us adore him.
[844.48 --> 856.72]  Who has given counsel to the Lord?
[856.72 --> 862.88]  Who can question any of his words?
[863.42 --> 869.32]  Who can be the one who knows all things?
[869.32 --> 873.96]  Who can't fathom all his word?
[873.96 --> 875.40]  The Lord?
[875.40 --> 881.30]  Would you love our grace,
[881.30 --> 889.40]  come let us adore him?
[889.40 --> 904.40]  Behold on Him, nothing will appear, and let us adore Him.
[904.40 --> 922.40]  Who has felt the nails upon His hands, bearing all the guilt of sinful men?
[922.40 --> 936.18]  Lord eternal, humble to the grave, Jesus Savior, risen now to reign.
[936.18 --> 949.18]  Behold on God, singing on His throne, come let us adore Him.
[949.18 --> 962.96]  Behold on Him, nothing will appear, and let us adore Him.
[962.96 --> 969.96]  Behold on Him, nothing will appear, and let us adore Him.
[969.96 --> 977.96]  Behold on Him, nothing will appear, and let us adore Him.
[977.96 --> 984.96]  Behold on Him, nothing will appear, and let us adore Him.
[984.96 --> 992.96]  Behold on Him, nothing will appear, and let us adore Him.
[992.96 --> 999.96]  Behold on Him, nothing will appear.
[999.96 --> 1006.44]  Let your glory for the Lord
[1006.44 --> 1012.28]  Let your glory for the Lord
[1012.28 --> 1018.36]  Let your glory for the Lord
[1018.36 --> 1023.56]  Behold our God
[1023.56 --> 1026.76]  Seated on His throne
[1026.76 --> 1031.16]  God let us adore Him
[1031.16 --> 1036.16]  Behold our King
[1036.16 --> 1039.16]  Let your glory for the Lord
[1039.16 --> 1044.16]  Let us adore Him
[1044.16 --> 1049.16]  Behold our God
[1049.16 --> 1052.76]  Seated on His throne
[1052.76 --> 1057.16]  Come let us adore Him
[1057.16 --> 1062.16]  Behold our King
[1062.16 --> 1066.16]  Nothing can compare
[1066.16 --> 1072.16]  Come let us adore Him
[1072.16 --> 1075.56]  Come let us adore Him
[1075.56 --> 1077.96]  I am King
[1077.96 --> 1084.36]  merciful
[1084.96 --> 1088.96]  mirror
[1088.96 --> 1090.96]  answering
[1090.96 --> 1094.10]  and
[1094.10 --> 1104.98]  You are Lord of creation and all of the world
[1104.98 --> 1109.28]  Lord of land and the sea
[1109.28 --> 1113.04]  Lord of land and the sea
[1113.04 --> 1115.10]  Lord of the sky
[1115.10 --> 1119.26]  Lord of all for you will be
[1119.26 --> 1121.38]  We bow down
[1121.38 --> 1124.38]  We bow down
[1124.38 --> 1126.38]  We bow down
[1126.38 --> 1129.38]  We bow down
[1129.38 --> 1131.38]  We bow down
[1131.38 --> 1133.38]  We bow down
[1133.38 --> 1135.38]  We bow down
[1135.38 --> 1139.38]  Lord of all for you will be
[1139.38 --> 1147.38]  You are King of creation and King of my life
[1147.38 --> 1151.38]  The King of land and the sea
[1151.38 --> 1153.38]  Lord of the land and the sea
[1153.38 --> 1155.38]  Lord of the heavens
[1155.38 --> 1157.38]  Lord of the sky
[1157.38 --> 1159.38]  We bow down
[1159.38 --> 1161.38]  We bow down
[1161.38 --> 1163.38]  We bow down
[1163.38 --> 1165.38]  We bow down
[1165.38 --> 1167.38]  We bow down
[1167.38 --> 1171.38]  We bow down
[1171.38 --> 1173.38]  We bow down
[1173.38 --> 1175.38]  We bow down
[1175.38 --> 1177.38]  We bow down
[1177.38 --> 1179.38]  We welcome to our name
[1179.38 --> 1185.24]  Let's pray.
[1188.82 --> 1195.50]  O Lord, you are our shepherd, and yet we selfishly want.
[1196.66 --> 1201.08]  We confess that we take comfort in earthly things rather than in you.
[1202.08 --> 1206.12]  We wander tempting paths when our eyes should be on you.
[1206.12 --> 1209.70]  We look away when we should act.
[1210.76 --> 1214.28]  We get angry when we could offer peace.
[1215.40 --> 1220.18]  We hate our enemies when we should love them as we love ourselves.
[1221.10 --> 1225.92]  We search for financial security when you provide all we need.
[1227.56 --> 1233.38]  Dear God, we fall so short of being the Christian example that we should be.
[1233.38 --> 1237.94]  We admit that we can feel like we are broken.
[1239.42 --> 1241.74]  Lord, we ask for your forgiveness.
[1245.24 --> 1249.26]  We know that your mercy is from everlasting to everlasting,
[1249.66 --> 1256.52]  and are reminded that in your amazing grace through Jesus, we are forgiven.
[1256.52 --> 1260.36]  What love you have shown us, Lord.
[1261.44 --> 1263.24]  Your love is beyond measure.
[1264.54 --> 1268.56]  Help us to always put you at the center of our lives, we pray.
[1269.64 --> 1270.00]  Amen.
[1270.00 --> 1286.10]  You're alone.
[1286.10 --> 1305.84]  All these pieces broken in sky
[1305.84 --> 1313.02]  In mercy gathered, man dead and old
[1313.02 --> 1319.76]  Empty hands, and humble Savior
[1319.76 --> 1325.84]  I'm inside, I'm inside
[1325.84 --> 1334.34]  Amazing grace, and sweet answer
[1334.34 --> 1339.84]  Savior, I wish I could
[1339.84 --> 1350.58]  Oh, I once was mine, and I was blind
[1350.58 --> 1357.32]  Oh, I can see you now
[1357.32 --> 1367.44]  Oh, I can see the love in your eyes
[1367.44 --> 1374.18]  Laying your surprise
[1374.18 --> 1382.18]  Praise in your love and to the Lord
[1382.18 --> 1400.92]  You take our fear, you take our weakness
[1400.92 --> 1406.92]  You set your treasure in jars of clay
[1406.92 --> 1413.66]  So take this humble, happy earth
[1413.66 --> 1420.40]  And I'm so, no way to see your love in me
[1420.40 --> 1428.40]  Amazing grace, and sweet and sad
[1428.40 --> 1433.40]  And save the flesh of you
[1433.40 --> 1442.14]  Oh, I once was lost, but now I am blind
[1442.14 --> 1446.14]  It's blind, but now I see
[1446.14 --> 1451.14]  Oh, I can see your love
[1451.14 --> 1460.14]  Oh, I can see the love in your eyes
[1460.14 --> 1466.88]  Oh, I can see your love in your eyes
[1466.88 --> 1473.88]  Amazing and broken to life
[1473.88 --> 1475.62]  Amazing and holy, to the stars
[1475.62 --> 1484.62]  Thank you, thank you
[1484.62 --> 1487.22]  April and to the stars
[1487.22 --> 1490.16]  Now I am
[1490.16 --> 1511.34]  In this embrace, I see the sun, but set a march like me.
[1511.34 --> 1523.58]  Oh, I once was lost, but never thought it was gone, but now I see.
[1524.80 --> 1528.04]  Oh, I can see you now.
[1528.04 --> 1549.70]  Oh, I can see the love in your eyes, laying yours on top, raising up a broken child.
[1558.04 --> 1567.16]  Why don't you take a seat together?
[1567.16 --> 1567.22]  Okay.
[1575.22 --> 1587.12]  This morning, it is our great privilege to come together and administer the sacrament of baptism to Jane.
[1588.04 --> 1595.68]  One of our, though no longer the youngest, one of our youngest worship participants and members here.
[1596.52 --> 1598.72]  Before we do this, I want to be really clear.
[1599.08 --> 1606.94]  In our church, we don't believe that there's anything magical about the water that we are about to apply to Jane.
[1607.30 --> 1611.94]  The water doesn't wash away original sin or save this child.
[1612.14 --> 1615.10]  Only Jesus' life and death does that.
[1615.20 --> 1615.36]  Amen?
[1615.36 --> 1630.78]  We believe, like the Bible teaches, that this child is sinful by nature and that the promises of God for the forgiveness of sins and life lived in the Holy Spirit are offered to her.
[1631.26 --> 1632.96]  That's Acts 2, verse 39.
[1632.96 --> 1642.66]  And so, in our church, we baptize infants not out of superstition or even out of tradition or because we like really cute babies.
[1642.78 --> 1645.18]  And if you haven't met Jane yet, she's super adorable.
[1646.42 --> 1653.32]  We baptize infants because they are covenant children and should therefore receive the sign of the covenant.
[1653.32 --> 1655.64]  But what is a covenant?
[1656.18 --> 1657.30]  And what are these signs?
[1658.64 --> 1665.12]  In Genesis 15, all the way back in the beginning of the Bible, God made a covenant with Abraham.
[1665.88 --> 1673.00]  But this covenant was sealed and signed with the symbol, the sign of circumcision in Genesis 17.
[1673.66 --> 1675.28]  And God blessed Abraham.
[1675.28 --> 1678.72]  Now, for Abraham, that meant two particular things.
[1678.86 --> 1681.90]  It meant offspring, children, and it meant land.
[1683.16 --> 1691.76]  But at the heart of the covenant is God's promise that he would be God to Abraham and to his children.
[1692.60 --> 1699.36]  And so God cut a covenant into Israel's flesh, carving out a people for himself.
[1699.36 --> 1705.80]  And then in the fullness of time, God sent his son, Jesus, to be our savior.
[1706.48 --> 1710.22]  And in his death on the cross, our old self is dead and buried.
[1710.44 --> 1718.34]  And in his resurrection, we rise to new life and look forward to the new creation, the end.
[1719.72 --> 1723.86]  And so when we baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
[1723.86 --> 1731.84]  the triune God seals our adoption and seals the promise, rather, of our adoption as his children
[1731.84 --> 1735.58]  and writes his name invisibly on our foreheads.
[1736.30 --> 1737.60]  He says in 1 Peter 2,
[1737.76 --> 1744.74]  You are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God.
[1744.90 --> 1749.26]  Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God.
[1749.26 --> 1756.34]  By baptism, we recognize the promise of a new identity in Jesus Christ.
[1757.80 --> 1762.88]  And so as we come together today to administer the sacrament of baptism to Jane,
[1763.32 --> 1767.86]  we do so with the weight of church history to encourage us
[1767.86 --> 1772.66]  and with the example of redemptive history to confirm our practice.
[1773.22 --> 1776.48]  We baptize in obedience to Christ's command,
[1776.48 --> 1786.28]  and the sacrament that we are about to administer is a sign of the inclusion in the covenant community,
[1786.64 --> 1787.98]  just as circumcision was.
[1788.36 --> 1792.70]  The water that we are about to pour is a sign of the cleansing from sin,
[1793.08 --> 1796.76]  just as the sprinkled blood of bulls and goats in the Old Testament was.
[1796.76 --> 1804.18]  And it is our prayer today that Jane will take advantage of all her covenant privileges,
[1804.18 --> 1808.76]  of all her regular hearing of these promises offered out to her,
[1808.82 --> 1811.92]  and that she will acknowledge her Lord all the days of her life
[1811.92 --> 1815.68]  and by faith make these promises her own.
[1816.88 --> 1819.18]  So Jesus and Megan, I'm going to invite you to the front.
[1819.18 --> 1821.78]  You're going to take a place up here.
[1822.28 --> 1823.66]  I'm going to ask you just two questions,
[1823.92 --> 1827.54]  and then we will baptize Jane together.
[1831.74 --> 1833.10]  So I'm going to ask you two questions,
[1833.18 --> 1836.20]  and I invite you to respond by saying we do with God's help.
[1838.80 --> 1839.70]  Jesus and Megan,
[1839.70 --> 1842.24]  Do you believe that Jane,
[1842.86 --> 1844.34]  though sinful by nature,
[1844.48 --> 1847.98]  is received by God in Christ as members of his covenant
[1847.98 --> 1849.76]  and therefore ought to be baptized?
[1851.04 --> 1852.16]  And then do you promise,
[1852.32 --> 1853.58]  in reliance on the Holy Spirit
[1853.58 --> 1855.86]  and with the help of the Christian community,
[1855.86 --> 1858.84]  to do all you can in your power
[1858.84 --> 1860.04]  to instruct Jane
[1860.04 --> 1862.62]  and any other children the Lord may bless you with
[1862.62 --> 1863.90]  in the Christian faith
[1863.90 --> 1865.34]  and to lead her,
[1865.70 --> 1866.42]  by example,
[1866.66 --> 1869.20]  into the life of Christian discipleship?
[1869.20 --> 1870.20]  What is your answer?
[1872.06 --> 1872.54]  Amen.
[1873.80 --> 1875.18]  Our Lord Jesus said,
[1875.48 --> 1877.08]  Let the little children come to me
[1877.08 --> 1879.12]  and do not hinder them,
[1879.24 --> 1881.40]  for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
[1881.48 --> 1883.30]  And so we're going to follow that practice of Jesus.
[1884.06 --> 1886.12]  Little children or children at heart,
[1886.54 --> 1887.86]  if you'd like to come forward,
[1888.02 --> 1890.22]  you can grab a seat here down at the front
[1890.22 --> 1892.46]  and you can see a little bit more clearly
[1892.46 --> 1894.00]  what's going on.
[1894.00 --> 1896.48]  And you can remember that for many of you,
[1896.86 --> 1898.16]  this was also done
[1898.16 --> 1900.30]  when you were just an infant.
[1900.96 --> 1901.70]  Come right in,
[1901.72 --> 1902.72]  just right here on the floor
[1902.72 --> 1904.08]  will be perfect.
[1908.18 --> 1908.96]  Awesome job.
[1909.08 --> 1910.68]  Oh, even with an excavator?
[1910.86 --> 1911.44]  Love it.
[1911.44 --> 1918.96]  All right.
[1918.96 --> 1919.82]  I'm going to bring her in here.
[1922.98 --> 1924.78]  So guys, we're going to take this water
[1924.78 --> 1927.42]  and we're going to pour it
[1927.42 --> 1929.74]  on Jane's head
[1929.74 --> 1930.82]  in the name of the Father
[1930.82 --> 1931.62]  and the Son
[1931.62 --> 1932.52]  and the Holy Spirit.
[1932.84 --> 1934.34]  And that's a picture for us,
[1934.38 --> 1935.90]  a reminder for us, right,
[1935.96 --> 1938.36]  that Jesus loved us so much
[1938.36 --> 1939.68]  that he came into the world
[1939.68 --> 1941.68]  to wash us and make us new
[1941.68 --> 1943.28]  and that out of that same love
[1943.28 --> 1944.88]  he calls us to be his own.
[1945.44 --> 1949.32]  This water is a sign of that promise
[1949.32 --> 1952.50]  and we make it real in this practice.
[1952.50 --> 1958.96]  Janica Ramona Hernandez.
[1959.38 --> 1960.96]  I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[1962.46 --> 1963.56]  in the name of the Son,
[1964.80 --> 1966.16]  in the name of the Holy Spirit.
[1967.08 --> 1967.38]  Amen.
[1969.52 --> 1969.92]  Amen.
[1969.92 --> 1970.12]  Amen.
[1977.96 --> 1978.36]  Amen.
[1978.36 --> 1978.48]  Amen.
[1982.50 --> 1987.72]  Church family,
[1988.28 --> 1989.80]  congregation of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1989.98 --> 1992.40]  friends who are here visiting in support,
[1992.82 --> 1995.52]  you also have an opportunity now
[1995.52 --> 1997.84]  to promise your love and encouragement.
[1998.20 --> 1999.24]  And so I'm going to ask you,
[1999.36 --> 2000.22]  again, as you're able,
[2000.54 --> 2001.32]  if you would stand
[2001.32 --> 2004.32]  and I will ask you a series of questions
[2004.32 --> 2006.18]  and then I will invite you to respond
[2006.18 --> 2006.96]  by saying,
[2006.96 --> 2008.90]  we do with God's help.
[2008.90 --> 2011.66]  And so do you,
[2011.86 --> 2012.62]  gathered here,
[2012.80 --> 2014.40]  promise to love and courage
[2014.40 --> 2015.48]  and support Jesus,
[2016.10 --> 2016.36]  Megan,
[2016.50 --> 2016.96]  and Jane
[2016.96 --> 2018.32]  by welcoming them
[2018.32 --> 2020.00]  into our church family,
[2020.36 --> 2021.80]  by teaching the gospel
[2021.80 --> 2022.74]  of God's love
[2022.74 --> 2024.28]  and by being an example
[2024.28 --> 2025.28]  of Christian faith
[2025.28 --> 2025.88]  and character
[2025.88 --> 2027.18]  and by giving them
[2027.18 --> 2028.24]  strong support,
[2028.74 --> 2029.72]  the strong support
[2029.72 --> 2030.80]  of God's family
[2030.80 --> 2031.44]  in fellowship,
[2032.00 --> 2032.26]  prayer,
[2032.26 --> 2033.28]  and service.
[2033.54 --> 2034.36]  What is your answer?
[2034.96 --> 2035.48]  Amen.
[2035.48 --> 2039.84]  Now I often say,
[2040.06 --> 2041.20]  when you hear that promise,
[2041.56 --> 2042.86]  take advantage of it.
[2043.74 --> 2045.86]  You've seen it in this past couple weeks
[2045.86 --> 2047.26]  in meals and things like that,
[2047.28 --> 2048.22]  but it doesn't have to stop there.
[2048.76 --> 2049.54]  If you need a date night,
[2049.66 --> 2050.48]  call someone from church
[2050.48 --> 2051.38]  and be like,
[2051.42 --> 2052.40]  remember your baptism.
[2054.88 --> 2055.90]  You may have a seat.
[2056.40 --> 2058.68]  You guys too may also have a seat.
[2060.04 --> 2060.94]  You can stay up here.
[2061.48 --> 2062.42]  Eric's already up here.
[2062.58 --> 2064.50]  So Eric is an elder in our church.
[2064.50 --> 2065.68]  He has a little gift
[2065.68 --> 2067.30]  to mark this occasion,
[2067.42 --> 2067.90]  a certificate,
[2068.18 --> 2068.76]  and a little book
[2068.76 --> 2069.60]  that we give out
[2069.60 --> 2070.64]  to every family
[2070.64 --> 2071.84]  who has baptism here.
[2075.52 --> 2076.36]  May I take her?
[2081.76 --> 2082.48]  I know.
[2085.96 --> 2089.38]  So this is one of my favorite parts
[2089.38 --> 2091.22]  of a baptism service.
[2092.58 --> 2093.90]  Because what we just witnessed
[2093.90 --> 2098.34]  marks the beginning of a journey of faith
[2098.34 --> 2100.42]  that we pray will continue
[2100.42 --> 2102.00]  for the rest of Jane's life
[2102.00 --> 2105.38]  where she will find herself among you.
[2106.28 --> 2108.30]  She will find herself among us
[2108.30 --> 2109.32]  as a church family,
[2109.52 --> 2111.08]  and that in that too,
[2111.24 --> 2113.90]  she will find faith in the Lord Jesus.
[2115.04 --> 2117.46]  And so this beautiful little girl
[2117.46 --> 2119.74]  is among you now
[2119.74 --> 2122.00]  as a sign of your responsibility
[2122.00 --> 2123.22]  and commitment to her.
[2123.22 --> 2125.66]  That you will lead her
[2125.66 --> 2127.02]  in the way of faith.
[2127.16 --> 2129.22]  That you will help her to grow
[2129.22 --> 2131.16]  and to see Jesus in the way
[2131.16 --> 2132.76]  that we live life together,
[2133.28 --> 2134.54]  sharing our stories,
[2134.86 --> 2136.30]  sharing our struggles,
[2136.80 --> 2138.24]  sharing our burdens.
[2138.98 --> 2143.48]  This is her story now among us.
[2145.18 --> 2146.38]  She is embraced,
[2146.70 --> 2147.28]  I pray,
[2147.62 --> 2148.60]  by each of us
[2148.60 --> 2149.72]  in this journey of faith.
[2149.72 --> 2150.84]  Because one day,
[2151.56 --> 2153.82]  just as her parents stood up here,
[2154.20 --> 2155.58]  we long to see her
[2155.58 --> 2156.80]  stand up here again
[2156.80 --> 2158.54]  and to claim this faith
[2158.54 --> 2159.56]  as her own.
[2160.16 --> 2161.94]  We long to see her stand up here
[2161.94 --> 2162.42]  and to say,
[2162.62 --> 2162.86]  yes,
[2163.08 --> 2164.78]  this I believe,
[2164.92 --> 2166.86]  that Jesus Christ is Lord
[2166.86 --> 2168.24]  and that God has raised him
[2168.24 --> 2168.86]  from the dead.
[2170.00 --> 2171.16]  And when that day comes,
[2171.26 --> 2172.50]  we will see the fulfillment
[2172.50 --> 2175.82]  of God's promise spoken today.
[2175.98 --> 2176.20]  Amen?
[2176.20 --> 2176.36]  Amen.
[2177.36 --> 2177.64]  Amen.
[2178.98 --> 2179.84]  Here you guys go.
[2198.36 --> 2199.92]  As you guys make your way
[2199.92 --> 2200.50]  to your seats,
[2200.58 --> 2201.78]  I'm just going to offer a prayer
[2201.78 --> 2203.80]  for Jane and for us together.
[2203.98 --> 2204.74]  Would you join your heart
[2204.74 --> 2205.36]  with me in prayer?
[2210.00 --> 2210.48]  Lord,
[2210.68 --> 2211.82]  our God,
[2212.46 --> 2214.76]  you are good
[2214.76 --> 2215.96]  and today we see
[2215.96 --> 2216.54]  your goodness
[2216.54 --> 2218.32]  in such a clear
[2218.32 --> 2219.90]  and compelling way.
[2220.58 --> 2221.48]  Today we see
[2221.48 --> 2222.90]  the promises of faith
[2222.90 --> 2223.76]  that are held out
[2223.76 --> 2224.48]  before us
[2224.48 --> 2226.00]  and we see our chance
[2226.00 --> 2226.84]  to respond
[2226.84 --> 2228.50]  and we are invited
[2228.50 --> 2229.78]  by your grace
[2229.78 --> 2233.06]  to experience
[2233.06 --> 2234.06]  your nearness
[2234.06 --> 2235.60]  in these moments.
[2236.22 --> 2237.14]  We thank you,
[2237.34 --> 2237.38]  God,
[2237.46 --> 2239.56]  for the sacrament
[2239.56 --> 2240.20]  of baptism
[2240.20 --> 2241.08]  for the sign
[2241.08 --> 2241.72]  and seal
[2241.72 --> 2242.70]  that is now placed
[2242.70 --> 2243.34]  on Jane
[2243.34 --> 2245.24]  as a covenant child.
[2246.38 --> 2247.20]  We pray,
[2247.38 --> 2247.72]  Lord God,
[2247.78 --> 2248.72]  that you would cause
[2248.72 --> 2249.76]  faith in her
[2249.76 --> 2251.76]  to take deep root,
[2252.42 --> 2253.40]  cause faith in her
[2253.40 --> 2254.00]  to grow
[2254.00 --> 2255.10]  that she might bear
[2255.10 --> 2256.08]  much fruit
[2256.08 --> 2257.02]  for the kingdom.
[2257.02 --> 2258.92]  And we pray,
[2259.08 --> 2259.26]  God,
[2259.32 --> 2260.32]  from this day
[2260.32 --> 2261.06]  forward,
[2261.18 --> 2262.04]  all the days
[2262.04 --> 2263.10]  of her life,
[2263.18 --> 2264.08]  she would know
[2264.08 --> 2264.78]  that you
[2264.78 --> 2266.40]  have blessed her
[2266.40 --> 2267.26]  and that you
[2267.26 --> 2268.16]  keep her.
[2269.04 --> 2269.80]  That you,
[2269.92 --> 2270.26]  Lord God,
[2270.30 --> 2271.18]  would make your face
[2271.18 --> 2272.48]  to shine visibly
[2272.48 --> 2273.64]  upon her
[2273.64 --> 2274.40]  and that you
[2274.40 --> 2275.44]  would be gracious
[2275.44 --> 2276.58]  to her.
[2278.20 --> 2279.60]  May she always
[2279.60 --> 2280.48]  and forever
[2280.48 --> 2281.54]  turn to you
[2281.54 --> 2283.92]  and see your face
[2283.92 --> 2285.22]  and may she know
[2285.22 --> 2286.06]  the peace
[2286.06 --> 2287.88]  that you give.
[2289.26 --> 2290.52]  In this way,
[2290.78 --> 2291.02]  Lord,
[2291.12 --> 2292.12]  you put your name
[2292.12 --> 2292.68]  on her
[2292.68 --> 2293.74]  and you make her
[2293.74 --> 2294.60]  your own.
[2294.70 --> 2296.20]  May she cling
[2296.20 --> 2297.36]  to that promise.
[2297.90 --> 2298.88]  In Jesus Christ,
[2299.04 --> 2299.46]  we pray.
[2300.34 --> 2300.68]  Amen.
[2301.68 --> 2302.04]  Amen.
[2302.04 --> 2304.72]  I'm going to
[2304.72 --> 2305.26]  invite the worship
[2305.26 --> 2305.96]  team back up
[2305.96 --> 2306.38]  and they're going
[2306.38 --> 2306.98]  to lead us
[2306.98 --> 2307.68]  in a song
[2307.68 --> 2308.62]  of response
[2308.62 --> 2309.90]  and continue
[2309.90 --> 2310.32]  our worship
[2310.32 --> 2310.60]  together.
[2310.60 --> 2310.70]  Amen.
[2332.04 --> 2360.32]  I love you, Lord.
[2360.32 --> 2362.32]  Amen.
[2362.32 --> 2364.50]  Oh, your mercy
[2364.50 --> 2366.62]  never gives me
[2366.62 --> 2370.54]  all my days.
[2370.78 --> 2372.14]  I've been held
[2372.14 --> 2374.56]  in your hands.
[2375.70 --> 2377.84]  Only that I may
[2377.84 --> 2378.76]  know
[2378.76 --> 2382.32]  until I lay my hands.
[2383.44 --> 2385.32]  I will sing
[2385.32 --> 2387.12]  of the goodness
[2387.12 --> 2388.86]  of God.
[2388.86 --> 2394.82]  all my life
[2394.82 --> 2397.42]  you have been faithful.
[2397.42 --> 2402.46]  All my life
[2402.46 --> 2404.46]  you have been so,
[2404.54 --> 2406.48]  so good.
[2408.42 --> 2410.12]  Every breath
[2410.12 --> 2412.54]  that I have made
[2412.54 --> 2415.92]  I will sing
[2415.92 --> 2417.62]  of the goodness
[2417.62 --> 2420.24]  of God.
[2421.10 --> 2424.48]  I love your voice.
[2426.14 --> 2427.94]  You have made me
[2427.94 --> 2429.64]  through the fire
[2429.64 --> 2433.22]  in the darkest night.
[2434.10 --> 2435.24]  You are close
[2435.24 --> 2437.06]  like no other.
[2437.06 --> 2439.02]  I know you
[2439.02 --> 2439.66]  I know you
[2439.66 --> 2441.32]  as a father
[2441.32 --> 2443.64]  I know you
[2443.64 --> 2445.62]  as a friend
[2445.62 --> 2447.66]  I have made
[2447.66 --> 2450.66]  in the goodness
[2450.66 --> 2452.66]  of God.
[2452.66 --> 2456.34]  God's grace.
[2456.34 --> 2458.02]  All my life
[2458.02 --> 2460.22]  you have been faithful.
[2460.22 --> 2461.22]  All my life
[2461.22 --> 2462.22]  you have been faithful.
[2462.22 --> 2465.62]  All my life
[2465.62 --> 2467.64]  you have been so,
[2467.72 --> 2469.22]  so alone.
[2469.22 --> 2473.22]  With every breath
[2473.22 --> 2475.46]  that I am made
[2475.46 --> 2476.38]  Lord,
[2476.38 --> 2479.02]  I will sing
[2479.02 --> 2480.78]  of the goodness
[2480.78 --> 2483.26]  of God.
[2483.26 --> 2485.26]  God's grace.
[2485.26 --> 2486.26]  God's grace.
[2486.26 --> 2487.62]  Your goodness
[2487.62 --> 2489.22]  is one and out
[2489.22 --> 2489.58]  for me.
[2489.58 --> 2491.38]  It's one and out
[2491.38 --> 2492.22]  for me.
[2493.64 --> 2495.22]  Your goodness
[2495.22 --> 2496.84]  is one and out
[2496.84 --> 2497.22]  for me.
[2497.22 --> 2498.96]  It's one and out
[2498.96 --> 2500.36]  for me.
[2500.56 --> 2501.54]  If my life
[2501.54 --> 2502.52]  lay down,
[2502.64 --> 2503.22]  it's a brand
[2503.22 --> 2504.54]  of God.
[2505.00 --> 2505.96]  Give you
[2505.96 --> 2507.08]  everything.
[2507.08 --> 2519.76]  My sins
[2519.76 --> 2533.30]  will
[2533.30 --> 2534.58]  be
[2534.58 --> 2538.58]  We give you everything I need
[2538.58 --> 2541.84]  Your goodness is coming out
[2541.84 --> 2544.58]  And joy and happiness
[2544.58 --> 2555.12]  All my life you have been faithful
[2555.12 --> 2564.56]  All my life you have been so, so good
[2564.56 --> 2570.30]  In every breath that I am able
[2570.30 --> 2577.64]  I will sing of the goodness of God
[2577.64 --> 2585.60]  I will sing of the goodness of God
[2594.56 --> 2611.30]  Good morning, my name is Yap
[2611.30 --> 2613.30]  I'm a deacon here at Langley-Emmanuel
[2613.30 --> 2617.16]  This morning's offering will be for Advocate
[2617.16 --> 2621.88]  Advocate provides safe, confidential, and compassionate care
[2621.88 --> 2625.64]  That is dedicated to serving and supporting women struggling
[2625.64 --> 2629.46]  With an unexpected pregnancy or a pregnancy loss
[2629.46 --> 2633.12]  From Psalm 139, verse 13
[2633.12 --> 2635.34]  For you created my inmost being
[2635.34 --> 2637.96]  You knit me together in my mother's womb
[2637.96 --> 2639.82]  Thank you
[2639.82 --> 2639.90]  Thank you
[2639.90 --> 2641.90]  Thank you
[2641.90 --> 2643.90]  Thank you
[2643.90 --> 2645.90]  Thank you
[2645.90 --> 2647.90]  Thank you
[2647.90 --> 2649.90]  Thank you
[2649.90 --> 2650.90]  Thank you
[2650.90 --> 2651.90]  Thank you
[2651.90 --> 2653.90]  Thank you
[2653.90 --> 2655.90]  Thank you
[2655.90 --> 2657.90]  Thank you
[2657.90 --> 2659.90]  Thank you
[2659.90 --> 2664.64]  Thank you
[2664.64 --> 2667.68]  Thank you
[2672.64 --> 2678.16]  Jesus have my heart that will be my soul
[2678.16 --> 2693.92]  Jesus, have my hopes, my dreams, my hope, the joy I ate in the world, the joy I cast for the night, Jesus, have you all.
[2693.92 --> 2716.92]  To you I bring my praise, my lips, my song, a living sacrifice as one reborn, your life is now my hope, your will is what I want, Jesus, have you all.
[2716.92 --> 2730.92]  Jesus, have it all, Jesus, have it all, give me all the glory, praise the Lord and all.
[2730.92 --> 2746.92]  Jesus, have it all, Jesus, have it all, the blessing and the wonder, the majesty and the eye, Jesus, have it all.
[2746.92 --> 2768.92]  Jesus, have your church, your love, your pride, joy for which you breathe, the hope of life, radiant and white, washed and beautiful, Jesus, have it all.
[2768.92 --> 2798.90]  Jesus, have it all, the blessing and the glory, Jesus, have it all.
[2798.90 --> 2828.88]  Jesus, have it all, the blessing and the glory, Jesus, have it all, the blessing and the glory, Jesus, have it all.
[2828.88 --> 2858.86]  Jesus, have it all.
[2858.86 --> 2862.86]  Jesus, how did I?
[2888.86 --> 2918.84]  Jesus, how did I?
[2918.86 --> 2948.84]  Jesus, how did I?
[2948.86 --> 2978.84]  Jesus, how did I?
[2978.84 --> 2979.62]  Good.
[2980.36 --> 2982.08]  I have a question for you today.
[2982.94 --> 2989.54]  Can you tell me one thing that you're nervous or afraid of?
[2990.54 --> 2991.46]  What do you think?
[2992.36 --> 2992.58]  Hayley?
[2993.32 --> 2994.00]  Spiders?
[2994.98 --> 2995.18]  Levi?
[2997.84 --> 2999.20]  Riding your scooter?
[2999.44 --> 2999.76]  Malachi?
[2999.76 --> 3003.42]  You're afraid of school?
[3003.42 --> 3003.86]  Emma?
[3003.86 --> 3005.92]  Emma?
[3005.92 --> 3012.04]  Mosquitoes?
[3012.10 --> 3013.54]  That's a good one to be afraid of.
[3013.54 --> 3014.54]  Amelia?
[3014.54 --> 3015.54]  Amelia?
[3015.54 --> 3015.60]  Amelia?
[3018.06 --> 3018.74]  Pardon me?
[3019.78 --> 3020.66]  Stink bugs.
[3021.06 --> 3021.18]  Yeah?
[3024.52 --> 3025.26]  The dark?
[3025.56 --> 3027.76]  Yeah, these are all very good things to be afraid of.
[3027.76 --> 3033.82]  So today in children's worship time, we are going to learn that when we put all our fears
[3033.82 --> 3041.12]  into God, that he will take them away and we will not be afraid anymore.
[3041.12 --> 3043.54]  So can everybody stand up?
[3047.54 --> 3048.54]  You guys ready?
[3048.76 --> 3049.60]  Look at the parents.
[3049.94 --> 3052.10]  Turn around and look at the congregation.
[3052.82 --> 3053.82]  Okay, here we go.
[3053.82 --> 3082.90]  Good morning.
[3083.82 --> 3085.68]  My name is Andy.
[3085.86 --> 3087.16]  I'm a member in this church.
[3088.16 --> 3091.84]  And I have been with my wife for, I figured out, 20 years.
[3092.30 --> 3093.14]  Man, time flies.
[3095.02 --> 3100.76]  So it's my privilege this morning to lead you in our weekly congregational family prayer.
[3102.34 --> 3108.38]  And I thought there might be some pre-prayer announcements, but there's none.
[3108.38 --> 3112.14]  So I'll just, let's go bow our heads and go to God in prayer.
[3113.82 --> 3125.24]  Dear God and Heavenly Father, once again, we may come before you in communal prayer to praise you,
[3125.24 --> 3129.46]  to thank you, and to lay our petitions at your throne.
[3129.46 --> 3138.88]  So we want to praise you for who you are to us, as we have already done in word, deed, and song.
[3139.32 --> 3145.90]  And we'll continue to do, not just in this worship service, but all day and every day during this week,
[3146.38 --> 3149.46]  at work or at play, at home or away.
[3149.46 --> 3154.36]  We'd like all of our activities to be acts of worship to you.
[3155.54 --> 3161.58]  Even though we know that all of them and our best intentions are stained by sin and weaknesses,
[3161.58 --> 3168.46]  we know that you will accept our praise and worship through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus,
[3169.12 --> 3173.34]  which washes us and our worship clean and white as snow.
[3174.68 --> 3177.44]  God, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[3177.44 --> 3207.42]  God, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[3207.62 --> 3208.96]  And we embrace you as Lord and Savior.
[3211.26 --> 3215.92]  We also mourn with those who mourn the loss of loved ones.
[3217.34 --> 3225.32]  Lately, we've seen many, older and even not so old, spouses, parents, grandparents, or other relatives pass on.
[3226.44 --> 3232.50]  And while we pray for your comfort in these deaths, we are also reminded of our own mortality,
[3232.50 --> 3235.94]  something we don't necessarily want to think about.
[3236.72 --> 3238.66]  But we ask you to grant your spirit
[3238.66 --> 3242.32]  to prepare our hearts to be ready to meet you when you call.
[3245.48 --> 3247.56]  We thank you with Joanne Miles
[3247.56 --> 3251.26]  that she and her family were able to celebrate her mom's 100th birthday.
[3252.56 --> 3255.36]  God, quite a milestone that you've given.
[3257.44 --> 3261.14]  We also continue to pray for Jerry Jansen's granddaughter Christina
[3261.14 --> 3262.74]  who is still struggling with lupus
[3262.74 --> 3264.98]  and was hospitalized with pneumonia
[3264.98 --> 3267.06]  but was able to come home.
[3268.16 --> 3269.16]  We thank you for that
[3269.16 --> 3272.72]  and will you provide a speedy and total recovery, Lord.
[3274.18 --> 3276.10]  We also thank you with the Wynn family
[3276.10 --> 3278.24]  that Emmett could recover and come home again.
[3279.88 --> 3282.04]  We also thank you that Weeb and Marga Bisser
[3282.04 --> 3285.46]  could come home safely from their six-week trip to Suriname
[3285.46 --> 3287.62]  and give thanks with them for the arrival
[3287.62 --> 3290.34]  of a new granddaughter there named Ariana.
[3291.14 --> 3293.84]  God, in your mercy, hear our prayer.
[3297.52 --> 3301.32]  Father, when we look around us to this world,
[3302.36 --> 3305.14]  it seems to be falling apart at the seams.
[3307.54 --> 3311.38]  We see how Satan seems to be winning his war
[3311.38 --> 3314.70]  of turning your truth into a blatant lie
[3314.70 --> 3316.10]  and vice versa.
[3316.10 --> 3320.86]  How justice is being taken over by injustice and corruption.
[3322.10 --> 3325.12]  How your order in creation is called into question
[3325.12 --> 3327.22]  by the woke gender theories.
[3328.18 --> 3331.56]  How violence and terrorism seem to be accepted practices
[3331.56 --> 3332.70]  throughout this world.
[3332.70 --> 3337.94]  We are hearing the drums of war sounding louder and louder
[3337.94 --> 3341.50]  and we continue to see how hatred and racism
[3341.50 --> 3343.58]  are now pervasive everywhere.
[3343.58 --> 3353.80]  We see and hear of volcanoes, earthquakes, and other disasters such as floods, droughts, fires, etc.
[3353.80 --> 3355.36]  plague your creation.
[3356.32 --> 3359.38]  And we hear it groaning under the curse.
[3359.38 --> 3363.14]  And we plead with you to call a halt to it all.
[3364.08 --> 3366.76]  We know you are in control and you can't stop it.
[3366.76 --> 3370.32]  We think of the country of Ukraine,
[3371.10 --> 3375.40]  which is engaged in a brutal defensive war for its existence against Russia.
[3376.40 --> 3378.54]  And we pray that they may be successful.
[3379.90 --> 3381.28]  We think of Sudan,
[3382.12 --> 3384.50]  where thousands are being killed in an ethnic war
[3384.50 --> 3387.04]  and so many other places in this world
[3387.04 --> 3391.54]  where dictators are repressing the poor and needy populations.
[3391.54 --> 3396.12]  We think of the Jewish people in general
[3396.12 --> 3397.86]  and the Jewish nation in particular
[3397.86 --> 3402.30]  who once again are facing vicious and violent hatred
[3402.30 --> 3405.84]  not just from their neighbors but from everywhere in this world.
[3407.10 --> 3408.30]  Even in our own country,
[3408.58 --> 3411.16]  we hear the cries of death to the Jews.
[3413.16 --> 3414.12]  Father God,
[3414.86 --> 3416.84]  these are the people of your first love.
[3418.10 --> 3420.66]  Please allow your Holy Spirit to work in them
[3420.66 --> 3425.64]  so they may open their eyes to Isaiah 53,
[3426.04 --> 3427.90]  which is part of their own Torah,
[3428.68 --> 3431.74]  and see that their long-awaited Messiah has already come
[3431.74 --> 3436.30]  and fulfilled his task of taking the sin of the world upon his shoulders.
[3438.08 --> 3439.02]  Father God,
[3439.14 --> 3441.66]  grant that the return of your Son, Jesus Christ,
[3441.74 --> 3442.52]  may happen soon
[3442.52 --> 3447.22]  so that this earth may be renewed and restored to its perfection
[3447.22 --> 3450.92]  as you had intended it when you created it.
[3452.30 --> 3452.78]  God,
[3452.88 --> 3453.44]  in your mercy,
[3454.32 --> 3455.08]  hear our prayer.
[3457.94 --> 3460.38]  We now ask you to bless Pastor Chris
[3460.38 --> 3463.10]  as he preaches your word to us this morning,
[3463.60 --> 3465.10]  that it may be clear and true
[3465.10 --> 3468.92]  as we will look at the letter to the Romans once again.
[3468.92 --> 3471.46]  for Jesus' sake,
[3472.32 --> 3472.56]  amen.
[3472.56 --> 3472.66]  Amen.
[3472.66 --> 3473.66]  Amen.
[3502.66 --> 3505.26]  So Monday, I was sitting at home.
[3506.04 --> 3508.06]  Monday is my day off usually.
[3508.50 --> 3511.78]  And all of a sudden I get a text from Jesus.
[3512.46 --> 3515.34]  And Jesus said, hey, we had a baby.
[3515.56 --> 3517.54]  We want to do the baptism on the 21st.
[3518.82 --> 3520.68]  And I said, excellent.
[3521.04 --> 3523.56]  Boy, girl, what's her name?
[3524.58 --> 3525.92]  Is mom feeling all right?
[3526.00 --> 3526.58]  How are we doing?
[3528.84 --> 3530.46]  Straight to business, that one.
[3532.66 --> 3535.46]  And he did tell me her name.
[3535.54 --> 3536.46]  He did remember that.
[3538.26 --> 3542.32]  And we went ahead and booked our baptism for today.
[3543.10 --> 3546.84]  But at the same time as we were having that conversation,
[3547.24 --> 3549.82]  I was thinking, oh, man.
[3551.30 --> 3555.14]  January 21st is our jump back into the book of Romans,
[3555.18 --> 3558.48]  which we've been in for I don't know how long it feels like to you,
[3558.56 --> 3560.00]  but I can tell you it's only been a year.
[3560.00 --> 3567.06]  And it's Romans 11, 25 to 32,
[3567.94 --> 3573.54]  which if you are unfamiliar with the book of Romans,
[3573.68 --> 3576.12]  and in particular chapters 9, 10, and 11,
[3576.60 --> 3581.20]  let me just tell you that this section of Scripture,
[3581.38 --> 3582.12]  these verses,
[3582.12 --> 3587.92]  are some of the most difficult and widely contested
[3587.92 --> 3591.88]  and debated passages of Scripture in the entire Bible.
[3593.48 --> 3595.40]  And so if you are a guest here,
[3596.20 --> 3600.00]  you can blame Jesus after the service
[3600.00 --> 3601.92]  for what he made you endure.
[3601.92 --> 3606.26]  If you are a guest here and you want to talk,
[3606.38 --> 3608.60]  I will be at the Connect booth afterwards.
[3609.14 --> 3610.26]  You don't have to find Jesus.
[3610.80 --> 3611.76]  Although you can,
[3612.08 --> 3613.88]  but just to give him your love and encouragement
[3613.88 --> 3615.20]  and the blessing of today.
[3616.56 --> 3618.76]  We're going to read this passage together,
[3618.76 --> 3621.44]  and I trust you will see pretty quickly
[3621.44 --> 3624.30]  why it is such a challenging one.
[3624.30 --> 3627.08]  As we go through it the first time,
[3627.46 --> 3629.78]  it will be on the screen behind me,
[3629.90 --> 3632.26]  but I do encourage you,
[3632.32 --> 3633.94]  if you have a Bible either with you
[3633.94 --> 3635.84]  or on a device that you brought,
[3635.92 --> 3636.88]  to have that in front of you
[3636.88 --> 3639.76]  because we will refer back pretty regularly
[3639.76 --> 3641.68]  here this morning.
[3642.48 --> 3643.86]  Let me read this together.
[3645.64 --> 3648.40]  Romans 11, we're going to start at verse 25.
[3648.40 --> 3655.06]  I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery,
[3655.28 --> 3656.24]  brothers and sisters,
[3656.60 --> 3659.18]  so that you may not be conceited.
[3660.22 --> 3663.64]  Israel has experienced a hardening in part
[3663.64 --> 3667.30]  until the full number of Gentiles has come in,
[3667.62 --> 3669.48]  and in this way,
[3669.98 --> 3672.14]  all Israel will be saved.
[3673.08 --> 3674.18]  As it is written,
[3674.66 --> 3676.64]  the deliverer will come from Zion,
[3676.64 --> 3679.58]  he will turn godlessness away from Jacob,
[3680.42 --> 3683.08]  and this is my covenant with them
[3683.08 --> 3684.58]  when I take away their sins.
[3685.60 --> 3687.94]  As far as the gospel is concerned,
[3688.14 --> 3689.84]  they are enemies for your sake,
[3689.98 --> 3692.44]  but as far as election is concerned,
[3692.90 --> 3695.76]  they are loved on account of the patriarchs,
[3695.76 --> 3699.18]  for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable.
[3700.06 --> 3701.26]  Just as you,
[3701.44 --> 3703.92]  who were at one time disobedient to God,
[3703.98 --> 3705.12]  have now received mercy
[3705.12 --> 3707.34]  as a result of their disobedience,
[3707.54 --> 3710.68]  so they too have now become disobedient
[3710.68 --> 3713.46]  in order that they may too now receive mercy
[3713.46 --> 3715.48]  as a result of God's mercy to you.
[3716.54 --> 3719.92]  For God has bound everyone over to disobedience,
[3720.08 --> 3723.32]  so that he may have mercy on them all.
[3724.18 --> 3725.52]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3725.52 --> 3736.48]  Now maybe as I was reading it,
[3737.28 --> 3740.38]  you had a bunch of questions pop in your mind.
[3741.40 --> 3742.98]  I know I do,
[3743.14 --> 3745.78]  and the first time I read it this week in preparation,
[3746.34 --> 3749.70]  and the hundredth time I read it this week in preparation,
[3749.86 --> 3752.12]  I still was coming up with new questions.
[3752.12 --> 3756.42]  One of the questions I had is the title of this sermon,
[3756.84 --> 3757.68]  which is,
[3757.96 --> 3759.34]  All Israel? Really?
[3760.68 --> 3762.64]  All Israel will be saved?
[3763.70 --> 3765.20]  That's just the first verse.
[3765.84 --> 3766.86]  And the first question,
[3767.96 --> 3769.58]  does that mean ethnic Israel?
[3770.10 --> 3772.18]  Does that mean the country of Israel?
[3772.64 --> 3773.92]  Does that mean all the people
[3773.92 --> 3777.78]  who have all ever identified as Israel,
[3778.12 --> 3779.96]  past, present, and future?
[3780.70 --> 3782.56]  Another question that I have when I read this is,
[3782.56 --> 3785.24]  what is the full number of Gentiles?
[3786.20 --> 3786.40]  Right?
[3786.46 --> 3787.12]  Does that mean like,
[3787.36 --> 3788.48]  in my head when I read that,
[3788.72 --> 3790.92]  I picture a countdown clock in heaven?
[3791.30 --> 3791.80]  Right?
[3791.86 --> 3793.56]  That has Gentiles over top of it,
[3793.66 --> 3795.06]  and it's counting down
[3795.06 --> 3797.32]  until we get to the full number,
[3797.44 --> 3799.24]  and that's finally when Jesus will return?
[3800.38 --> 3801.70]  No, that's probably not actually
[3801.70 --> 3802.68]  what's happening in heaven.
[3802.80 --> 3803.00]  Okay?
[3803.08 --> 3804.20]  Don't take that.
[3805.40 --> 3806.82]  But that's what I wonder.
[3806.94 --> 3808.78]  Who and how and how many?
[3808.78 --> 3810.78]  I read this,
[3810.84 --> 3811.14]  and I wonder,
[3811.32 --> 3811.52]  when?
[3812.26 --> 3813.48]  When is this going to happen?
[3813.92 --> 3815.20]  Is it already happening?
[3815.68 --> 3816.70]  How will we see it?
[3816.76 --> 3817.46]  How will we know?
[3818.08 --> 3818.90]  Will we see it?
[3819.02 --> 3819.78]  Will we know it?
[3821.36 --> 3821.64]  Now,
[3822.62 --> 3824.38]  as we
[3824.38 --> 3826.36]  dig into this
[3826.36 --> 3827.56]  text this morning,
[3827.80 --> 3829.46]  I don't
[3829.46 --> 3830.62]  imagine that we
[3830.62 --> 3831.38]  will answer
[3831.38 --> 3832.14]  every one
[3832.14 --> 3833.56]  of your questions.
[3833.82 --> 3833.90]  We,
[3834.28 --> 3834.98]  to be honest,
[3835.02 --> 3835.70]  just don't have time
[3835.70 --> 3836.30]  for that.
[3836.30 --> 3838.20]  what I do hope
[3838.20 --> 3838.64]  you do,
[3838.72 --> 3838.88]  though,
[3838.92 --> 3839.86]  is you take
[3839.86 --> 3840.62]  your questions,
[3841.28 --> 3842.02]  and you take
[3842.02 --> 3842.74]  some of the answers
[3842.74 --> 3843.38]  that we give
[3843.38 --> 3844.16]  here this morning,
[3844.16 --> 3845.32]  and you continue
[3845.32 --> 3846.08]  to dig deeper.
[3846.20 --> 3846.66]  You continue
[3846.66 --> 3848.04]  to wrestle with them,
[3848.06 --> 3848.76]  that you ask
[3848.76 --> 3849.54]  and explore
[3849.54 --> 3850.84]  and follow
[3850.84 --> 3851.86]  your curiosity
[3851.86 --> 3853.16]  into the word
[3853.16 --> 3853.66]  of God,
[3853.66 --> 3854.34]  and that can happen
[3854.34 --> 3855.70]  in your grow groups,
[3855.82 --> 3856.36]  care groups,
[3856.44 --> 3856.98]  that can happen
[3856.98 --> 3858.48]  in your small groups,
[3858.52 --> 3859.74]  or wherever that happens,
[3859.74 --> 3860.86]  I pray that you
[3860.86 --> 3861.50]  take this
[3861.50 --> 3862.86]  as a starting point
[3862.86 --> 3864.04]  to an ongoing
[3864.04 --> 3864.78]  conversation
[3864.78 --> 3866.02]  with discipleship.
[3867.88 --> 3868.80]  The question
[3868.80 --> 3869.16]  that I want
[3869.16 --> 3869.96]  to begin with
[3869.96 --> 3872.40]  is this.
[3873.28 --> 3874.34]  When Paul
[3874.34 --> 3875.20]  says,
[3875.68 --> 3876.30]  all Israel
[3876.30 --> 3877.50]  will be saved,
[3878.00 --> 3878.50]  who
[3878.50 --> 3879.68]  does he
[3879.68 --> 3880.42]  mean?
[3881.78 --> 3882.30]  Like,
[3882.38 --> 3883.00]  all Israel
[3883.00 --> 3884.34]  without distinction?
[3885.50 --> 3886.22]  And then,
[3886.26 --> 3886.66]  I want to ask
[3886.66 --> 3887.24]  the question,
[3887.46 --> 3887.86]  how
[3887.86 --> 3888.90]  will this
[3888.90 --> 3889.18]  happen?
[3889.18 --> 3891.16]  You know,
[3892.42 --> 3893.94]  as is often
[3893.94 --> 3895.10]  prudent and wise
[3895.10 --> 3896.08]  before we begin,
[3896.76 --> 3897.98]  I just want to name
[3897.98 --> 3898.80]  an assumption
[3898.80 --> 3900.40]  that I'm carrying
[3900.40 --> 3901.08]  into
[3901.08 --> 3902.28]  this
[3902.28 --> 3903.52]  explanation.
[3904.18 --> 3904.38]  Now,
[3904.42 --> 3905.40]  I hope for most of us
[3905.40 --> 3906.40]  it's a shared assumption,
[3906.62 --> 3907.82]  but I imagine
[3907.82 --> 3908.96]  it's not for all of us.
[3909.30 --> 3910.16]  And the assumption
[3910.16 --> 3911.10]  that I'm carrying
[3911.10 --> 3912.08]  into this
[3912.08 --> 3912.96]  is
[3912.96 --> 3914.74]  to give Paul
[3914.74 --> 3915.42]  a particular
[3915.42 --> 3916.40]  amount of credit,
[3916.88 --> 3917.52]  or to give him
[3917.52 --> 3918.26]  a certain amount
[3918.26 --> 3919.00]  of trust, right?
[3919.00 --> 3920.32]  What I mean is
[3920.32 --> 3921.44]  I'm going to assume
[3921.44 --> 3922.12]  that Paul,
[3922.30 --> 3923.56]  when he is writing,
[3924.02 --> 3924.80]  is not going to
[3924.80 --> 3925.86]  contradict himself.
[3926.96 --> 3927.14]  Right?
[3927.16 --> 3928.02]  Especially in these
[3928.02 --> 3928.72]  three chapters
[3928.72 --> 3929.20]  that we've been
[3929.20 --> 3930.10]  looking at for a while,
[3930.16 --> 3930.92]  the hard ones,
[3931.00 --> 3932.00]  9, 10, and 11.
[3932.48 --> 3932.78]  Right?
[3932.80 --> 3933.28]  I'm assuming
[3933.28 --> 3934.04]  that there's no
[3934.04 --> 3935.02]  contradictions.
[3936.46 --> 3936.90]  Also,
[3937.10 --> 3938.04]  I don't believe
[3938.04 --> 3938.80]  that Paul
[3938.80 --> 3939.32]  is going to
[3939.32 --> 3940.08]  contradict himself
[3940.08 --> 3941.06]  in the larger scale,
[3941.14 --> 3941.42]  that is,
[3941.56 --> 3942.16]  in the whole
[3942.16 --> 3942.66]  of the letter
[3942.66 --> 3943.36]  to the Romans,
[3943.50 --> 3944.56]  but also in the
[3944.56 --> 3945.26]  other letters
[3945.26 --> 3945.96]  that he wrote
[3945.96 --> 3946.86]  in the New Testament.
[3947.64 --> 3948.12]  And then,
[3948.12 --> 3948.96]  not just Paul,
[3949.08 --> 3949.78]  I'm going to go
[3949.78 --> 3950.32]  into this
[3950.32 --> 3950.78]  assuming
[3950.78 --> 3952.00]  that
[3952.00 --> 3953.60]  the
[3953.60 --> 3955.50]  entire
[3955.50 --> 3956.50]  New Testament
[3956.50 --> 3958.76]  canon,
[3959.06 --> 3959.68]  the writings
[3959.68 --> 3960.50]  of the New Testament,
[3961.02 --> 3961.86]  aren't going to
[3961.86 --> 3963.06]  contradict themselves
[3963.06 --> 3963.90]  either.
[3964.50 --> 3965.20]  And then,
[3965.24 --> 3965.84]  we'll go one
[3965.84 --> 3966.52]  step further
[3966.52 --> 3967.26]  and then say
[3967.26 --> 3968.56]  that I don't believe
[3968.56 --> 3969.56]  there are contradictions
[3969.56 --> 3970.26]  in the Old
[3970.26 --> 3970.94]  and New Testament
[3970.94 --> 3971.72]  together.
[3972.74 --> 3973.00]  Right?
[3973.06 --> 3973.92]  That the
[3973.92 --> 3974.92]  Word of God,
[3975.16 --> 3976.44]  the God-breathed,
[3976.44 --> 3977.96]  God-inspired Word
[3977.96 --> 3978.86]  given to us
[3978.86 --> 3980.18]  in our tradition
[3980.18 --> 3981.30]  in two Testaments,
[3981.42 --> 3981.84]  the Old
[3981.84 --> 3982.50]  and the New,
[3983.50 --> 3984.80]  the Bible
[3984.80 --> 3986.38]  is
[3986.38 --> 3987.98]  internally
[3987.98 --> 3989.20]  consistent.
[3990.30 --> 3990.48]  Now,
[3990.52 --> 3991.12]  this assumption,
[3991.42 --> 3992.04]  to put a name
[3992.04 --> 3992.38]  on it,
[3992.40 --> 3993.30]  is part of
[3993.30 --> 3994.86]  our shared
[3994.86 --> 3995.42]  doctrine
[3995.42 --> 3996.58]  of inspiration.
[3997.16 --> 3997.30]  Right?
[3997.32 --> 3997.86]  How we believe
[3997.86 --> 3999.32]  God inspired
[3999.32 --> 3999.92]  the Bible
[3999.92 --> 4000.82]  to be written.
[4000.90 --> 4001.72]  And I don't believe,
[4001.84 --> 4002.02]  then,
[4002.06 --> 4002.46]  that there are
[4002.46 --> 4003.16]  contradictions
[4003.16 --> 4004.12]  within it.
[4004.62 --> 4004.84]  Now,
[4004.86 --> 4005.64]  let me be really clear,
[4005.64 --> 4005.86]  right?
[4005.90 --> 4006.82]  Because even though
[4006.82 --> 4007.16]  there are no
[4007.16 --> 4007.70]  contradictions,
[4007.84 --> 4008.66]  there are difficult
[4008.66 --> 4009.16]  passages.
[4010.34 --> 4010.64]  And that's
[4010.64 --> 4011.62]  absolutely the case.
[4012.16 --> 4012.82]  And there are
[4012.82 --> 4013.64]  parts of Scripture
[4013.64 --> 4014.26]  that are really
[4014.26 --> 4015.34]  hard to reconcile
[4015.34 --> 4016.80]  one to the other.
[4017.66 --> 4018.58]  And there are
[4018.58 --> 4019.42]  parts of Scripture
[4019.42 --> 4020.46]  and doctrines
[4020.46 --> 4021.10]  that it teaches
[4021.10 --> 4022.02]  that are ultimately,
[4022.32 --> 4022.86]  in their fullness,
[4023.32 --> 4024.20]  beyond human
[4024.20 --> 4024.80]  comprehension.
[4026.68 --> 4027.16]  But,
[4027.54 --> 4028.50]  because Scripture
[4028.50 --> 4029.48]  is God-breathed,
[4029.56 --> 4030.16]  because it is
[4030.16 --> 4031.58]  inspired by God,
[4031.90 --> 4032.82]  it follows,
[4033.18 --> 4033.92]  in my mind,
[4034.06 --> 4034.86]  that the revelation
[4034.86 --> 4035.48]  of God,
[4035.56 --> 4036.82]  His Word to us,
[4037.64 --> 4039.20]  is infallible.
[4039.90 --> 4040.82]  And that's a fancy
[4040.82 --> 4041.78]  theological word
[4041.78 --> 4042.22]  that means
[4042.22 --> 4043.98]  without falsification
[4043.98 --> 4044.76]  or error
[4044.76 --> 4045.50]  or deceit.
[4046.66 --> 4047.14]  Now,
[4047.22 --> 4048.02]  all of that
[4048.02 --> 4048.64]  together,
[4049.20 --> 4049.50]  right,
[4049.58 --> 4050.18]  means that
[4050.18 --> 4050.94]  for us to
[4050.94 --> 4051.80]  understand
[4051.80 --> 4053.02]  a difficult
[4053.02 --> 4053.68]  passage
[4053.68 --> 4055.12]  like this one,
[4055.20 --> 4055.66]  a difficult
[4055.66 --> 4056.36]  verse like
[4056.36 --> 4057.42]  these ones,
[4057.60 --> 4058.88]  we need to
[4058.88 --> 4059.68]  look to
[4059.68 --> 4060.60]  other verses
[4060.60 --> 4061.96]  to make sense
[4061.96 --> 4062.12]  of it.
[4062.16 --> 4062.80]  We need to let
[4062.80 --> 4064.10]  Scripture interpret
[4064.10 --> 4064.78]  Scripture.
[4065.74 --> 4067.02]  We must zoom out
[4067.02 --> 4067.84]  to see the whole
[4067.84 --> 4068.80]  teaching in order
[4068.80 --> 4069.62]  to understand
[4069.62 --> 4070.56]  a particular
[4070.56 --> 4071.70]  teaching.
[4073.60 --> 4074.58]  And so,
[4074.82 --> 4077.30]  here's what I think,
[4077.40 --> 4077.66]  then,
[4077.74 --> 4079.30]  is the big idea
[4079.30 --> 4080.06]  or the thesis
[4080.06 --> 4081.06]  of Paul's point
[4081.06 --> 4081.82]  in this text,
[4082.40 --> 4083.14]  the particular
[4083.14 --> 4083.98]  teaching that he's
[4083.98 --> 4084.80]  making that I think
[4084.80 --> 4085.78]  we can zoom out
[4085.78 --> 4086.80]  to undergird
[4086.80 --> 4087.50]  together.
[4088.80 --> 4089.44]  And that is
[4089.44 --> 4090.78]  that at some point,
[4090.78 --> 4091.74]  all Israel
[4091.74 --> 4092.86]  will be saved
[4092.86 --> 4093.50]  by God
[4093.50 --> 4094.96]  and their salvation
[4094.96 --> 4096.02]  will be
[4096.02 --> 4097.06]  by the means
[4097.06 --> 4098.14]  common to us
[4098.14 --> 4098.56]  all,
[4099.52 --> 4099.96]  namely,
[4100.16 --> 4101.12]  believing in Jesus
[4101.12 --> 4102.32]  as a result
[4102.32 --> 4103.30]  of God's grace.
[4104.58 --> 4105.16]  So,
[4105.24 --> 4105.58]  if you are
[4105.58 --> 4106.74]  a note-taker,
[4107.10 --> 4108.40]  that's your heading.
[4108.80 --> 4109.68]  We'll explain
[4109.68 --> 4110.08]  through
[4110.08 --> 4111.18]  in the rest.
[4112.48 --> 4112.74]  And so,
[4112.82 --> 4112.98]  then,
[4113.04 --> 4113.70]  to see that,
[4113.78 --> 4114.52]  let's first
[4114.52 --> 4115.74]  establish together
[4115.74 --> 4116.90]  who it is
[4116.90 --> 4117.58]  that Paul is
[4117.58 --> 4118.62]  referring to
[4118.62 --> 4120.22]  in verse 26
[4120.22 --> 4121.46]  when he says,
[4121.84 --> 4122.88]  all Israel.
[4123.52 --> 4124.98]  Because it can be
[4124.98 --> 4125.58]  confusing.
[4126.60 --> 4127.18]  And in fact,
[4127.30 --> 4128.08]  because it's,
[4128.30 --> 4129.06]  part of its confusion
[4129.06 --> 4129.66]  is because
[4129.66 --> 4131.86]  there's a compounding
[4131.86 --> 4132.90]  of distinctions
[4132.90 --> 4134.66]  that are being made
[4134.66 --> 4135.76]  already in this
[4135.76 --> 4136.56]  section.
[4137.30 --> 4138.22]  I'm going to walk you
[4138.22 --> 4138.68]  through this
[4138.68 --> 4139.44]  really quickly.
[4139.62 --> 4140.52]  The verses will be
[4140.52 --> 4141.12]  on the screen
[4141.12 --> 4142.16]  behind me
[4142.16 --> 4143.38]  so you can see them
[4143.38 --> 4143.94]  and don't have to
[4143.94 --> 4145.02]  flip through.
[4146.08 --> 4148.04]  But in chapter 9,
[4148.04 --> 4149.16]  verse 6,
[4150.04 --> 4151.02]  Paul says,
[4151.12 --> 4152.00]  rather explicitly,
[4152.36 --> 4153.16]  not all who are
[4153.16 --> 4154.60]  descended from Israel
[4154.60 --> 4155.86]  are Israel.
[4156.68 --> 4157.18]  And then again
[4157.18 --> 4157.78]  in verse 8,
[4157.86 --> 4158.44]  he continues,
[4158.90 --> 4159.52]  it is children
[4159.52 --> 4160.56]  of the promise
[4160.56 --> 4161.58]  who are
[4161.58 --> 4163.42]  Abraham's descendants.
[4164.76 --> 4165.10]  So,
[4165.14 --> 4165.56]  when we looked
[4165.56 --> 4166.36]  at these verses,
[4166.66 --> 4167.36]  we noted that
[4167.36 --> 4168.46]  Paul is here
[4168.46 --> 4169.42]  making a distinction
[4169.42 --> 4171.36]  between ethnic Israel
[4171.36 --> 4174.10]  and spiritual Israel.
[4175.56 --> 4175.88]  Right?
[4175.94 --> 4176.84]  In terms of,
[4176.96 --> 4177.04]  then,
[4177.04 --> 4178.40]  belief and believing
[4178.40 --> 4179.34]  and of receiving
[4179.34 --> 4180.64]  salvation by grace
[4180.64 --> 4181.78]  and by the mercy
[4181.78 --> 4182.38]  of God,
[4182.52 --> 4183.20]  Paul continues
[4183.20 --> 4184.78]  these distinctions
[4184.78 --> 4185.34]  and he says
[4185.34 --> 4186.50]  in chapter 10,
[4186.62 --> 4187.36]  verse 12,
[4188.04 --> 4188.96]  for again,
[4189.14 --> 4190.50]  there is no difference
[4190.50 --> 4191.44]  between Jew
[4191.44 --> 4192.64]  and Gentile.
[4193.10 --> 4193.56]  But again,
[4193.68 --> 4193.84]  right,
[4193.90 --> 4195.02]  Paul is confirming
[4195.02 --> 4197.42]  the spiritual reality
[4197.42 --> 4199.88]  that makes true Israel
[4199.88 --> 4200.58]  inclusive
[4200.58 --> 4202.40]  of all who believe,
[4202.50 --> 4203.06]  all who are
[4203.06 --> 4204.74]  children of Abraham.
[4204.74 --> 4206.22]  and then we keep
[4206.22 --> 4206.58]  going.
[4207.24 --> 4207.98]  In verse 16
[4207.98 --> 4208.92]  of chapter 10,
[4209.04 --> 4209.62]  it says,
[4210.06 --> 4211.48]  but not all Israel
[4211.48 --> 4212.94]  accepted the good news.
[4213.76 --> 4213.96]  Now,
[4214.00 --> 4214.22]  you see,
[4214.26 --> 4214.96]  he's left behind
[4214.96 --> 4215.56]  the distinction
[4215.56 --> 4218.20]  of the spiritual Israel
[4218.20 --> 4219.78]  and has returned
[4219.78 --> 4221.56]  to ethnic Israel.
[4221.56 --> 4221.80]  Right?
[4221.86 --> 4222.40]  Very clearly,
[4222.40 --> 4223.38]  he's returned here
[4223.38 --> 4224.58]  because he's making
[4224.58 --> 4225.26]  the distinction
[4225.26 --> 4226.92]  within the people
[4226.92 --> 4227.76]  of Israel.
[4227.76 --> 4229.14]  And then he continues
[4229.14 --> 4230.46]  in chapter 11,
[4230.60 --> 4231.44]  verse 5,
[4231.60 --> 4233.14]  where we read,
[4233.34 --> 4234.58]  at the present time,
[4234.86 --> 4235.86]  there is a remnant
[4235.86 --> 4237.76]  chosen by grace.
[4238.34 --> 4238.70]  And so here,
[4238.76 --> 4239.70]  he's naming that distinction
[4239.70 --> 4240.20]  again,
[4240.54 --> 4241.24]  but saying there are
[4241.24 --> 4242.34]  those who are Israel
[4242.34 --> 4243.90]  who are ethnic Israel
[4243.90 --> 4244.98]  and those who are Israel
[4244.98 --> 4246.26]  who are spiritual Israel
[4246.26 --> 4247.46]  and the two aren't
[4247.46 --> 4248.62]  one to one the same.
[4249.40 --> 4250.56]  He continues in verse 7,
[4250.66 --> 4251.74]  what the people of Israel
[4251.74 --> 4253.88]  sought to so earnestly
[4253.88 --> 4255.26]  they did not obtain.
[4255.26 --> 4257.22]  The elect among them did,
[4257.56 --> 4258.54]  but the others were hardened.
[4260.10 --> 4261.44]  So Israel here
[4261.44 --> 4263.32]  means that the elect
[4263.32 --> 4264.90]  and the hardened,
[4265.06 --> 4266.06]  the remnant who believe
[4266.06 --> 4267.98]  and those who don't.
[4269.60 --> 4269.96]  And so,
[4270.06 --> 4271.38]  pulling all this together
[4271.38 --> 4271.94]  slowly,
[4273.24 --> 4275.04]  what we're beginning to see
[4275.04 --> 4275.86]  is that maybe
[4275.86 --> 4277.00]  in our text,
[4277.22 --> 4278.16]  all Israel
[4278.16 --> 4280.26]  isn't only
[4280.80 --> 4282.70]  the true Israel
[4282.70 --> 4284.16]  or the spiritual Israel
[4284.16 --> 4285.66]  of Abraham's descendants
[4285.66 --> 4286.34]  that were mentioned
[4286.34 --> 4287.50]  in earlier verses.
[4288.44 --> 4288.72]  Now,
[4288.76 --> 4289.54]  I want to make that point
[4289.54 --> 4291.34]  as clearly as I can,
[4292.06 --> 4292.22]  right,
[4292.28 --> 4293.72]  that all Israel,
[4293.88 --> 4294.96]  I think here,
[4295.18 --> 4296.60]  means ethnic Israel,
[4296.76 --> 4298.04]  not the spiritual,
[4298.56 --> 4299.36]  true Israel
[4299.36 --> 4300.08]  that's inclusive
[4300.08 --> 4301.32]  of Gentiles
[4301.32 --> 4302.16]  and Jews,
[4303.12 --> 4304.00]  because there are
[4304.00 --> 4305.18]  some really good teachers
[4305.18 --> 4305.76]  of the Bible
[4305.76 --> 4307.16]  who disagree
[4307.70 --> 4308.84]  with the way
[4308.84 --> 4309.60]  I just framed that.
[4310.56 --> 4310.76]  Right,
[4310.80 --> 4311.62]  that when Paul says
[4311.62 --> 4312.42]  all Israel,
[4312.42 --> 4313.88]  he means only
[4313.88 --> 4314.68]  the remnant,
[4314.78 --> 4315.42]  only the true
[4315.42 --> 4316.42]  spiritual descendants.
[4316.62 --> 4317.42]  He means the fullness
[4317.42 --> 4319.06]  of believing Gentiles.
[4319.56 --> 4320.16]  In fact,
[4320.44 --> 4321.58]  this was the position
[4321.58 --> 4322.50]  of John Calvin.
[4323.64 --> 4323.84]  Now,
[4323.90 --> 4325.00]  in the Christian Reformed Church,
[4325.14 --> 4325.52]  generally,
[4325.66 --> 4326.64]  it's a good rule of thumb
[4326.64 --> 4328.10]  to agree with John Calvin,
[4328.96 --> 4330.16]  but I don't,
[4330.92 --> 4332.00]  at least here.
[4332.88 --> 4334.40]  In almost every other place,
[4334.50 --> 4334.74]  yes,
[4335.12 --> 4335.78]  but here,
[4335.86 --> 4337.60]  I think he is wrong,
[4337.64 --> 4338.28]  and I'll get into
[4338.28 --> 4338.68]  some of that.
[4338.68 --> 4340.92]  his argument
[4340.92 --> 4341.84]  is that it's not
[4341.84 --> 4342.92]  an ethnic marker,
[4343.14 --> 4344.62]  but it's a spiritual marker
[4344.62 --> 4345.66]  that refers to,
[4345.74 --> 4346.78]  this is from his commentary
[4346.78 --> 4347.76]  on Romans,
[4348.04 --> 4348.94]  the whole tree,
[4349.20 --> 4349.36]  right?
[4349.50 --> 4350.50]  As we read there,
[4350.62 --> 4351.22]  the example,
[4351.36 --> 4351.70]  the metaphor
[4351.70 --> 4353.08]  that Paul uses
[4353.08 --> 4353.66]  of a tree
[4353.66 --> 4354.46]  that includes
[4354.46 --> 4355.50]  the faithful branches
[4355.50 --> 4357.12]  and the wild branches
[4357.12 --> 4358.04]  that have been grafted
[4358.04 --> 4358.50]  back in.
[4360.70 --> 4361.18]  But,
[4361.18 --> 4363.36]  I don't think
[4363.36 --> 4363.98]  that's how Paul
[4363.98 --> 4364.74]  uses the word.
[4366.12 --> 4366.24]  Right?
[4366.26 --> 4366.86]  He continues
[4366.86 --> 4368.62]  in verse 11,
[4368.84 --> 4369.18]  again,
[4369.54 --> 4371.04]  in chapter 11,
[4371.12 --> 4371.60]  verse 11,
[4371.70 --> 4372.26]  we didn't read it,
[4372.32 --> 4372.80]  but that's why
[4372.80 --> 4373.46]  you have your Bibles.
[4374.28 --> 4374.72]  He says,
[4374.80 --> 4375.74]  salvation has come
[4375.74 --> 4376.62]  to the Gentiles
[4376.62 --> 4377.76]  to make Israel
[4377.76 --> 4378.48]  envious.
[4379.48 --> 4380.14]  I take pride
[4380.14 --> 4380.78]  in my ministry
[4380.78 --> 4381.24]  in the hope
[4381.24 --> 4381.98]  that I may somehow
[4381.98 --> 4383.18]  arouse my own people
[4383.18 --> 4383.60]  to envy
[4383.60 --> 4384.58]  and save some
[4384.58 --> 4385.42]  of them.
[4386.48 --> 4386.88]  Again,
[4387.12 --> 4387.32]  right,
[4387.38 --> 4387.76]  you can see
[4387.76 --> 4388.20]  the line
[4388.20 --> 4388.86]  that is being drawn.
[4388.96 --> 4389.64]  There's a contrast
[4389.64 --> 4390.90]  between Gentiles,
[4390.90 --> 4391.74]  the word Gentiles,
[4391.84 --> 4393.82]  which is an ethnic marker
[4393.82 --> 4394.72]  for people
[4394.72 --> 4395.94]  who are not Jewish,
[4396.34 --> 4396.48]  right,
[4396.52 --> 4397.00]  all people
[4397.00 --> 4397.66]  who are not Jewish,
[4397.78 --> 4398.72]  and that contrast
[4398.72 --> 4399.96]  of an ethnic identity
[4399.96 --> 4401.74]  is marked against Israel.
[4402.38 --> 4402.58]  So,
[4402.62 --> 4403.20]  I'm suggesting
[4403.20 --> 4405.04]  that it's an ethnic marker.
[4406.54 --> 4407.06]  And so,
[4407.26 --> 4408.62]  in verse 23,
[4409.10 --> 4411.02]  Paul makes this promise.
[4412.12 --> 4412.58]  He writes,
[4413.20 --> 4414.74]  if they do not persist
[4414.74 --> 4415.92]  in unbelief,
[4416.24 --> 4416.50]  they,
[4416.62 --> 4417.32]  that is Israel,
[4417.60 --> 4419.32]  will be grafted in.
[4419.32 --> 4421.00]  Now,
[4421.24 --> 4422.38]  remember that line,
[4422.50 --> 4423.68]  if they do not persist
[4423.68 --> 4424.36]  in unbelief.
[4424.48 --> 4424.94]  Park that
[4424.94 --> 4425.84]  in the corner
[4425.84 --> 4426.32]  of your brain
[4426.32 --> 4426.76]  because we're going
[4426.76 --> 4429.04]  to pick that back up
[4429.04 --> 4429.78]  because it will become
[4429.78 --> 4431.40]  important for the second half.
[4432.04 --> 4432.84]  But notice,
[4433.02 --> 4434.08]  the point that Paul
[4434.08 --> 4434.66]  is making
[4434.66 --> 4435.50]  is that
[4435.50 --> 4437.70]  the ethnic Israel
[4437.70 --> 4438.90]  who believes
[4438.90 --> 4440.20]  will be grafted back in.
[4441.46 --> 4441.76]  And then,
[4441.84 --> 4442.52]  in verse 26,
[4442.84 --> 4443.34]  he says,
[4443.48 --> 4444.40]  in this way,
[4444.40 --> 4445.26]  all Israel
[4445.26 --> 4446.52]  will be saved.
[4448.30 --> 4449.56]  This is the culmination
[4449.56 --> 4450.56]  of the image,
[4450.66 --> 4451.12]  the metaphor
[4451.12 --> 4452.50]  of the olive tree,
[4452.80 --> 4454.20]  which unbelieving Israel
[4454.20 --> 4455.70]  has been cut off from
[4455.70 --> 4456.60]  for a period
[4456.60 --> 4458.00]  and believing Gentiles
[4458.00 --> 4458.94]  have been grafted
[4458.94 --> 4459.86]  back into.
[4460.08 --> 4460.34]  And then,
[4460.40 --> 4460.94]  the promise
[4460.94 --> 4461.96]  that Paul speaks
[4461.96 --> 4463.06]  is that Israel
[4463.06 --> 4463.94]  can be grafted
[4463.94 --> 4465.18]  back into the tree
[4465.18 --> 4466.58]  as a natural branch.
[4466.62 --> 4466.94]  And he says,
[4467.04 --> 4467.30]  in fact,
[4467.44 --> 4468.62]  it's even easier
[4468.62 --> 4469.86]  for them to be grafted
[4469.86 --> 4470.36]  back in
[4470.36 --> 4471.64]  as a natural branch.
[4472.64 --> 4472.82]  So,
[4472.88 --> 4473.80]  if you have your own Bible
[4473.80 --> 4474.76]  and you're reading along,
[4475.50 --> 4476.68]  you might want to circle
[4476.68 --> 4478.38]  in this way
[4478.38 --> 4479.32]  in verse 26
[4479.32 --> 4480.82]  and then circle,
[4481.10 --> 4481.98]  they will be grafted
[4481.98 --> 4482.50]  back in
[4482.50 --> 4483.24]  in verse 29
[4483.24 --> 4484.32]  and draw a line
[4484.32 --> 4485.50]  back to that
[4485.50 --> 4486.76]  because that's how
[4486.76 --> 4489.18]  they will be grafted
[4489.18 --> 4489.66]  or that's the
[4489.66 --> 4490.38]  in this way.
[4490.50 --> 4491.14]  In what way?
[4491.60 --> 4492.82]  By being grafted back in.
[4493.76 --> 4493.96]  Now,
[4494.00 --> 4494.42]  notice,
[4494.94 --> 4496.02]  in that image,
[4496.14 --> 4496.34]  right,
[4496.42 --> 4496.88]  importantly,
[4497.44 --> 4499.22]  there's only one tree.
[4500.70 --> 4501.62]  All Israel,
[4501.64 --> 4503.00]  is grafted
[4503.00 --> 4504.22]  back in.
[4506.74 --> 4507.28]  And so,
[4507.62 --> 4509.44]  to recap so far,
[4509.54 --> 4510.84]  my point has been
[4510.84 --> 4512.42]  that when Paul says
[4512.42 --> 4513.36]  all Israel
[4513.36 --> 4514.32]  in verse 26,
[4514.72 --> 4516.14]  he does mean
[4516.14 --> 4518.22]  ethnic Israel.
[4519.38 --> 4520.16]  The contrast
[4520.16 --> 4521.48]  has been between
[4521.48 --> 4522.68]  Gentiles who believe
[4522.68 --> 4523.56]  and Israel
[4523.56 --> 4524.62]  who doesn't
[4524.62 --> 4525.16]  or at least
[4525.16 --> 4526.50]  who doesn't yet.
[4527.82 --> 4528.86]  It wouldn't be,
[4529.10 --> 4529.72]  Paul describes it
[4529.72 --> 4530.66]  as a mystery.
[4531.40 --> 4532.02]  I do not want you
[4532.02 --> 4532.46]  to be ignorant
[4532.46 --> 4533.22]  of this mystery.
[4533.56 --> 4534.42]  It wouldn't be
[4534.42 --> 4535.14]  a mystery
[4535.14 --> 4536.88]  if Paul was only
[4536.88 --> 4537.68]  talking about
[4537.68 --> 4538.94]  elected Gentiles
[4538.94 --> 4539.78]  and the remnant
[4539.78 --> 4540.34]  of Jews.
[4542.08 --> 4542.56]  Right?
[4542.62 --> 4543.24]  That would be,
[4543.84 --> 4545.12]  that would make sense
[4545.12 --> 4545.70]  and wouldn't be
[4545.70 --> 4546.14]  a mystery.
[4546.14 --> 4547.16]  But precisely
[4547.16 --> 4548.54]  because this is
[4548.54 --> 4549.66]  hard to wrap
[4549.66 --> 4550.46]  our heads around,
[4551.04 --> 4551.92]  that's what makes
[4551.92 --> 4552.48]  it a mystery.
[4553.14 --> 4553.82]  And I think
[4553.82 --> 4554.64]  precisely because
[4554.64 --> 4555.16]  it's the more
[4555.16 --> 4556.66]  difficult understanding,
[4556.80 --> 4557.52]  that's what makes it
[4557.52 --> 4558.38]  more likely
[4558.38 --> 4559.12]  to be true.
[4560.32 --> 4560.96]  Now the next
[4560.96 --> 4561.64]  question is,
[4561.84 --> 4562.52]  then,
[4563.30 --> 4564.18]  how does Paul
[4564.18 --> 4565.14]  use the word
[4565.14 --> 4565.84]  all?
[4566.62 --> 4567.24]  So if we're talking
[4567.24 --> 4568.08]  about ethnic Israel,
[4568.20 --> 4570.00]  what is all Israel?
[4570.80 --> 4571.06]  Right?
[4571.10 --> 4571.62]  When we read
[4571.62 --> 4572.34]  all Israel,
[4572.56 --> 4573.42]  what does that
[4573.42 --> 4574.08]  mean?
[4574.08 --> 4574.90]  Now,
[4575.90 --> 4580.24]  I don't think
[4580.24 --> 4582.92]  that all Israel
[4582.92 --> 4585.14]  means every single
[4585.14 --> 4585.96]  Israelite
[4585.96 --> 4587.08]  without exception.
[4588.70 --> 4589.18]  Instead,
[4590.06 --> 4591.68]  what Paul means
[4591.68 --> 4593.22]  is Israel
[4593.22 --> 4594.24]  as a whole.
[4594.92 --> 4595.12]  Right?
[4595.14 --> 4595.96]  He's talking about
[4595.96 --> 4596.88]  ethnic Israel
[4596.88 --> 4598.40]  in a general sense.
[4599.52 --> 4599.98]  Now let me make
[4599.98 --> 4600.42]  this point
[4600.42 --> 4601.58]  by looking somewhere else
[4601.58 --> 4602.42]  because Israel
[4602.42 --> 4603.42]  and even the phrase
[4603.42 --> 4604.20]  all Israel
[4604.20 --> 4605.72]  is used this way
[4605.72 --> 4606.46]  in lots of other
[4606.46 --> 4607.26]  places in the Bible.
[4608.02 --> 4609.08]  One really clear
[4609.08 --> 4610.06]  example is from
[4610.06 --> 4611.70]  2 Chronicles 12,
[4612.04 --> 4612.74]  verse 1.
[4612.92 --> 4613.82]  So this is back
[4613.82 --> 4615.20]  in the Old Testament.
[4616.56 --> 4617.10]  It says,
[4617.70 --> 4619.58]  after Rehoboam's
[4619.58 --> 4620.60]  position as king
[4620.60 --> 4621.38]  was established
[4621.38 --> 4622.52]  and he had become
[4622.52 --> 4623.12]  strong,
[4623.40 --> 4625.42]  he and all Israel
[4625.42 --> 4626.42]  with him
[4626.42 --> 4627.96]  abandoned the law
[4627.96 --> 4628.84]  of the Lord.
[4630.42 --> 4631.06]  Now I use this
[4631.06 --> 4631.76]  as an example
[4631.76 --> 4632.68]  because it's really
[4632.68 --> 4633.16]  interesting
[4633.16 --> 4634.10]  for two reasons.
[4634.82 --> 4635.68]  First of all,
[4636.12 --> 4636.78]  Rehoboam
[4636.78 --> 4638.60]  is the first king
[4638.60 --> 4640.18]  in what's called
[4640.18 --> 4641.28]  the divided kingdom.
[4642.04 --> 4643.06]  So after Solomon,
[4643.56 --> 4644.86]  the kingdom of Israel
[4644.86 --> 4645.56]  is divided
[4645.56 --> 4646.48]  into the northern
[4646.48 --> 4647.66]  kingdom called Israel
[4647.66 --> 4648.52]  and the southern
[4648.52 --> 4649.66]  kingdom called Judah.
[4650.96 --> 4652.14]  At this point,
[4652.94 --> 4653.62]  Rehoboam
[4653.62 --> 4654.50]  becomes king
[4654.50 --> 4656.02]  not in the northern
[4656.02 --> 4656.98]  kingdom of Israel
[4656.98 --> 4658.46]  but in Judah.
[4658.46 --> 4660.56]  And so when they write
[4660.56 --> 4661.16]  in Chronicles,
[4661.30 --> 4662.12]  all Israel
[4662.12 --> 4663.34]  had abandoned
[4663.34 --> 4663.86]  the Lord,
[4664.66 --> 4665.38]  actually,
[4666.14 --> 4667.50]  he's king in Judah
[4667.50 --> 4668.72]  and so they're using
[4668.72 --> 4670.40]  Israel as a name
[4670.40 --> 4671.22]  or a placeholder
[4671.22 --> 4671.78]  for something
[4671.78 --> 4672.68]  that is not directly,
[4672.80 --> 4673.08]  but again,
[4673.18 --> 4674.10]  referring to
[4674.10 --> 4674.90]  the whole.
[4677.08 --> 4677.92]  This part of
[4677.92 --> 4680.58]  Chronicles
[4680.58 --> 4681.02]  then,
[4681.36 --> 4681.96]  also,
[4682.18 --> 4682.78]  the second reason
[4682.78 --> 4683.44]  why it's interesting
[4683.44 --> 4686.40]  is that all Israel
[4686.40 --> 4687.14]  with him
[4687.14 --> 4687.80]  had abandoned
[4687.80 --> 4688.30]  the law
[4688.30 --> 4688.86]  of the Lord.
[4689.50 --> 4689.86]  And yet,
[4689.96 --> 4690.52]  when you read
[4690.52 --> 4691.70]  the other telling
[4691.70 --> 4692.70]  of this story,
[4692.82 --> 4693.32]  it's recorded
[4693.32 --> 4694.64]  in 1 Kings 13,
[4695.22 --> 4696.36]  there's a fascinating
[4696.36 --> 4697.72]  recounting
[4697.72 --> 4698.50]  of a prophet
[4698.50 --> 4699.58]  who doesn't have
[4699.58 --> 4700.52]  any name given
[4700.52 --> 4702.18]  but who is identified
[4702.18 --> 4703.42]  in 1 Kings 13
[4703.42 --> 4703.98]  verse 1
[4703.98 --> 4705.10]  only as
[4705.10 --> 4706.36]  a man of God
[4706.36 --> 4707.00]  who came
[4707.00 --> 4708.12]  from Judah.
[4708.12 --> 4710.54]  Now,
[4710.60 --> 4711.76]  this man prophesies
[4711.76 --> 4712.56]  that one day
[4712.56 --> 4713.64]  a king will come
[4713.64 --> 4714.34]  and he even
[4714.34 --> 4714.98]  gives his name.
[4715.06 --> 4715.96]  He says his name
[4715.96 --> 4717.10]  will be a son
[4717.10 --> 4718.52]  called Josiah
[4718.52 --> 4719.94]  in the line of David.
[4721.26 --> 4721.84]  And so this too
[4721.84 --> 4722.50]  is to the southern
[4722.50 --> 4723.22]  kingdom.
[4724.04 --> 4724.14]  Now,
[4724.20 --> 4725.20]  about 300 years
[4725.20 --> 4726.18]  after Rehoboam,
[4727.78 --> 4728.32]  Josiah
[4728.32 --> 4729.58]  becomes king
[4729.58 --> 4731.16]  and he's actually
[4731.16 --> 4731.52]  credited
[4731.52 --> 4732.22]  with all sorts
[4732.22 --> 4732.84]  of reforms
[4732.84 --> 4733.60]  that brought
[4733.60 --> 4734.08]  the people
[4734.08 --> 4734.90]  back to God.
[4735.74 --> 4736.06]  Right?
[4736.12 --> 4736.70]  And a lineage
[4736.70 --> 4737.72]  of really bad
[4737.72 --> 4738.36]  kings
[4738.36 --> 4739.66]  leading the people
[4739.66 --> 4740.10]  away,
[4740.30 --> 4741.28]  Josiah comes
[4741.28 --> 4742.14]  and is one
[4742.14 --> 4743.34]  that leads
[4743.34 --> 4743.88]  the people
[4743.88 --> 4745.14]  back to God.
[4746.64 --> 4747.22]  The reason why
[4747.22 --> 4747.90]  this is an important
[4747.90 --> 4749.36]  point and is pertinent
[4749.36 --> 4749.74]  for here
[4749.74 --> 4750.84]  because the Bible
[4750.84 --> 4752.88]  describes all Israel
[4752.88 --> 4753.94]  as walking away
[4753.94 --> 4754.52]  and yet,
[4754.68 --> 4755.36]  obviously,
[4755.82 --> 4756.94]  there's a distinction
[4756.94 --> 4759.40]  within that phrase
[4759.40 --> 4760.62]  because there is
[4760.62 --> 4761.54]  a man of God
[4761.54 --> 4762.50]  who prophesies
[4762.50 --> 4764.98]  and who told
[4764.98 --> 4765.68]  the truth
[4765.68 --> 4766.68]  about Josiah
[4766.68 --> 4767.70]  who we can
[4767.70 --> 4767.96]  then,
[4768.16 --> 4768.36]  I think,
[4768.56 --> 4769.18]  conclude
[4769.18 --> 4770.44]  didn't abandon
[4770.44 --> 4771.24]  the law
[4771.24 --> 4772.08]  of the Lord
[4772.08 --> 4773.18]  because he's
[4773.18 --> 4773.80]  a man of God.
[4775.58 --> 4775.70]  Right?
[4775.76 --> 4776.74]  Using the phrase
[4776.74 --> 4777.72]  all Israel
[4777.72 --> 4778.98]  still allows
[4778.98 --> 4781.10]  for exceptions
[4781.10 --> 4782.90]  or for distinctions
[4782.90 --> 4784.42]  within it.
[4784.42 --> 4787.92]  now,
[4788.18 --> 4790.44]  that means that
[4790.44 --> 4791.06]  it's most
[4791.06 --> 4792.66]  likely the case
[4792.66 --> 4794.34]  that what Paul
[4794.34 --> 4795.62]  is referring
[4795.62 --> 4796.70]  to here
[4796.70 --> 4797.48]  back in
[4797.48 --> 4798.68]  Romans 11
[4798.68 --> 4799.76]  26 now
[4799.76 --> 4801.28]  is
[4801.28 --> 4804.62]  a great
[4804.62 --> 4805.26]  mass
[4805.26 --> 4806.30]  of
[4806.30 --> 4807.86]  Jewish
[4807.86 --> 4808.56]  people
[4808.56 --> 4809.42]  who will
[4809.42 --> 4810.10]  come to
[4810.10 --> 4810.52]  believe.
[4810.52 --> 4812.26]  Paul is
[4812.26 --> 4812.92]  not saying
[4812.92 --> 4813.72]  that every
[4813.72 --> 4814.40]  Jew
[4814.40 --> 4815.08]  will be
[4815.08 --> 4815.62]  saved
[4815.62 --> 4816.02]  but that
[4816.02 --> 4816.56]  the vast
[4816.56 --> 4816.94]  number
[4816.94 --> 4817.20]  of
[4817.20 --> 4817.98]  Israelites
[4817.98 --> 4819.40]  will join
[4819.40 --> 4820.30]  the believing
[4820.30 --> 4821.02]  remnant
[4821.02 --> 4821.70]  at some
[4821.70 --> 4822.22]  point
[4822.22 --> 4823.38]  in history.
[4823.90 --> 4824.48]  Maybe it's a
[4824.48 --> 4825.38]  future thing,
[4825.46 --> 4825.96]  maybe it's a
[4825.96 --> 4826.64]  concurrent thing,
[4826.70 --> 4827.16]  we'll dig into
[4827.16 --> 4827.40]  that.
[4829.34 --> 4829.92]  The use
[4829.92 --> 4830.62]  of this
[4830.62 --> 4831.18]  word
[4831.18 --> 4831.66]  in this
[4831.66 --> 4832.08]  way,
[4832.96 --> 4833.62]  the word
[4833.62 --> 4834.00]  Israel
[4834.00 --> 4834.58]  in this
[4834.58 --> 4834.80]  way,
[4834.94 --> 4835.36]  matches
[4835.36 --> 4836.68]  also how
[4836.68 --> 4837.08]  it's used
[4837.08 --> 4837.38]  in the
[4837.38 --> 4838.26]  rest of
[4838.26 --> 4838.78]  the chapter
[4838.78 --> 4839.52]  and in
[4839.52 --> 4839.86]  the rest
[4839.86 --> 4840.14]  of this
[4840.14 --> 4840.32]  little
[4840.32 --> 4840.68]  section.
[4841.12 --> 4841.38]  Remember,
[4841.60 --> 4841.84]  we're
[4841.84 --> 4842.70]  looking for
[4842.70 --> 4843.26]  contradictions.
[4845.30 --> 4845.98]  Paul
[4845.98 --> 4846.90]  often uses
[4846.90 --> 4847.34]  the word
[4847.34 --> 4847.74]  Israel
[4847.74 --> 4848.62]  to refer
[4848.62 --> 4849.36]  to the
[4849.36 --> 4849.86]  majority
[4849.86 --> 4850.96]  of Israel
[4850.96 --> 4851.58]  over
[4851.58 --> 4852.10]  against
[4852.10 --> 4852.66]  the
[4852.66 --> 4853.50]  minority
[4853.50 --> 4854.74]  of
[4854.74 --> 4855.24]  Jews
[4855.24 --> 4855.80]  who did
[4855.80 --> 4856.20]  come to
[4856.20 --> 4856.58]  believe
[4856.58 --> 4857.32]  in Jesus
[4857.32 --> 4857.80]  at the
[4857.80 --> 4858.06]  time.
[4859.02 --> 4859.42]  And so,
[4859.76 --> 4860.28]  for instance,
[4860.42 --> 4860.76]  when Paul
[4860.76 --> 4861.34]  speaks about
[4861.34 --> 4861.78]  Israel
[4861.78 --> 4862.32]  rejecting
[4862.32 --> 4862.96]  the gospel,
[4863.38 --> 4863.60]  he's
[4863.60 --> 4864.16]  obviously
[4864.16 --> 4864.60]  not
[4864.60 --> 4865.08]  including
[4865.08 --> 4865.66]  himself
[4865.66 --> 4866.28]  in
[4866.28 --> 4866.62]  that,
[4867.38 --> 4867.62]  right,
[4867.68 --> 4868.32]  because he's
[4868.32 --> 4868.82]  an example
[4868.82 --> 4869.36]  that not
[4869.36 --> 4869.84]  all Israel
[4869.84 --> 4871.18]  has rejected
[4871.18 --> 4871.78]  the gospel,
[4872.30 --> 4872.86]  even though
[4872.86 --> 4873.58]  he is part
[4873.58 --> 4874.86]  of ethnic
[4874.86 --> 4875.70]  Israel.
[4877.98 --> 4878.66]  Now,
[4879.20 --> 4880.02]  as we
[4880.02 --> 4882.58]  wade
[4882.58 --> 4883.30]  our way
[4883.30 --> 4884.04]  through
[4884.04 --> 4884.62]  this,
[4885.36 --> 4886.00]  it's also
[4886.00 --> 4886.80]  important to
[4886.80 --> 4887.94]  realize at
[4887.94 --> 4888.46]  this point
[4888.46 --> 4888.90]  that there
[4888.90 --> 4890.14]  are many
[4890.14 --> 4890.88]  people,
[4891.30 --> 4891.66]  Bible
[4891.66 --> 4892.10]  scholars,
[4892.32 --> 4892.66]  teachers
[4892.66 --> 4893.18]  alike,
[4893.18 --> 4894.78]  who think
[4894.78 --> 4895.52]  that Paul
[4895.52 --> 4896.54]  must be
[4896.54 --> 4897.46]  talking about
[4897.46 --> 4898.24]  some sort
[4898.24 --> 4899.06]  of last
[4899.06 --> 4899.52]  minute,
[4899.78 --> 4901.02]  large scale,
[4901.52 --> 4902.54]  end times,
[4902.72 --> 4903.66]  mass revival
[4903.66 --> 4904.66]  of Christianity
[4904.66 --> 4905.34]  among the
[4905.34 --> 4905.94]  Jewish people.
[4907.10 --> 4907.96]  And honestly,
[4908.06 --> 4908.64]  that could be
[4908.64 --> 4909.16]  the case.
[4910.86 --> 4911.76]  But the
[4911.76 --> 4912.34]  language that
[4912.34 --> 4912.86]  Paul uses
[4912.86 --> 4914.66]  here doesn't
[4914.66 --> 4915.40]  require that
[4915.40 --> 4916.02]  that is the
[4916.02 --> 4916.34]  case,
[4916.74 --> 4917.08]  or doesn't
[4917.08 --> 4917.94]  necessitate that
[4917.94 --> 4918.28]  that's the
[4918.28 --> 4918.82]  only way
[4918.82 --> 4920.14]  to understand
[4920.14 --> 4920.54]  it.
[4920.54 --> 4921.50]  Paul's
[4921.50 --> 4921.90]  language
[4921.90 --> 4922.96]  here could
[4922.96 --> 4923.58]  allow,
[4924.14 --> 4924.92]  and tip my
[4924.92 --> 4925.14]  hand,
[4925.22 --> 4925.48]  I think
[4925.48 --> 4926.24]  actually probably
[4926.24 --> 4927.14]  leans in this
[4927.14 --> 4927.38]  way,
[4927.70 --> 4928.40]  could allow
[4928.40 --> 4929.08]  for a
[4929.08 --> 4930.22]  steady but
[4930.22 --> 4930.72]  growing,
[4930.88 --> 4932.50]  slowly increasing
[4932.50 --> 4933.44]  number of
[4933.44 --> 4933.98]  Jews who
[4933.98 --> 4934.38]  become
[4934.38 --> 4934.90]  Christian
[4934.90 --> 4935.92]  until we
[4935.92 --> 4936.64]  arrive at a
[4936.64 --> 4937.56]  time when
[4937.56 --> 4938.26]  it is more
[4938.26 --> 4939.38]  or most
[4939.38 --> 4941.14]  who believe
[4941.14 --> 4942.24]  in Jesus.
[4942.24 --> 4942.38]  Jesus.
[4943.56 --> 4944.18]  In fact,
[4944.26 --> 4944.56]  I think
[4944.56 --> 4945.50]  this move,
[4946.26 --> 4947.00]  whether it's
[4947.00 --> 4947.76]  a large
[4947.76 --> 4949.10]  conversion
[4949.10 --> 4949.82]  near the
[4949.82 --> 4950.32]  end of
[4950.32 --> 4950.98]  time or
[4950.98 --> 4951.50]  a more
[4951.50 --> 4952.76]  slow and
[4952.76 --> 4953.28]  progressive
[4953.28 --> 4954.22]  culmination
[4954.22 --> 4954.68]  of things,
[4954.98 --> 4955.32]  I think
[4955.32 --> 4956.38]  it's the
[4956.38 --> 4957.28]  conclusion of
[4957.28 --> 4958.32]  that that
[4958.32 --> 4958.92]  gives Paul
[4958.92 --> 4959.92]  confidence
[4959.92 --> 4961.76]  to quote
[4961.76 --> 4962.90]  from Isaiah,
[4963.14 --> 4964.16]  which he does
[4964.16 --> 4965.50]  immediately following.
[4965.62 --> 4966.06]  He says,
[4966.58 --> 4967.62]  the deliverer
[4967.62 --> 4968.20]  will come
[4968.20 --> 4968.92]  from Zion,
[4969.12 --> 4969.92]  he will turn
[4969.92 --> 4970.76]  godlessness
[4970.76 --> 4972.14]  away from
[4972.14 --> 4972.52]  Jacob.
[4972.90 --> 4973.40]  Now remember,
[4973.56 --> 4974.22]  Jacob's name
[4974.22 --> 4974.90]  was changed
[4974.90 --> 4976.98]  to Israel.
[4978.16 --> 4978.64]  And then he
[4978.64 --> 4978.78]  says,
[4978.88 --> 4979.46]  this is my
[4979.46 --> 4980.08]  covenant with
[4980.08 --> 4980.64]  them when I
[4980.64 --> 4981.24]  take away
[4981.24 --> 4982.24]  their sins.
[4983.22 --> 4984.16]  This confidence
[4984.16 --> 4985.04]  that Paul has,
[4985.10 --> 4985.52]  I think,
[4985.58 --> 4986.24]  is the same
[4986.24 --> 4987.46]  confidence that's
[4987.46 --> 4988.32]  expressed in
[4988.32 --> 4989.84]  verse 28 when
[4989.84 --> 4990.36]  he says,
[4990.68 --> 4991.22]  as far as
[4991.22 --> 4992.10]  election is
[4992.10 --> 4992.68]  concerned,
[4992.86 --> 4993.42]  they are loved
[4993.42 --> 4994.04]  on account of
[4994.04 --> 4995.00]  the patriarchs,
[4995.00 --> 4995.68]  for God's
[4995.68 --> 4996.56]  gifts and his
[4996.56 --> 4997.58]  call are
[4997.58 --> 4998.38]  irrevocable.
[4999.78 --> 5000.60]  So what we're
[5000.60 --> 5001.16]  seeing is that
[5001.16 --> 5002.50]  ethnic Israel
[5002.50 --> 5004.20]  matters in
[5004.20 --> 5004.90]  God's plan
[5004.90 --> 5005.56]  of salvation.
[5006.78 --> 5007.42]  And a day
[5007.42 --> 5008.20]  will come
[5008.20 --> 5009.54]  when most
[5009.54 --> 5010.08]  of them
[5010.08 --> 5011.46]  remember that.
[5012.70 --> 5013.34]  And when
[5013.34 --> 5014.02]  they remember
[5014.02 --> 5014.44]  that,
[5014.62 --> 5015.28]  salvation will
[5015.28 --> 5015.68]  come to
[5015.68 --> 5015.86]  them.
[5016.18 --> 5016.82]  That's Paul's
[5016.82 --> 5017.08]  hope.
[5018.90 --> 5020.52]  But the
[5020.52 --> 5021.14]  ground of
[5021.14 --> 5021.92]  their salvation
[5021.92 --> 5023.38]  is still the
[5023.38 --> 5024.50]  same as the
[5024.50 --> 5025.34]  ground of our
[5025.34 --> 5025.94]  salvation,
[5026.18 --> 5027.22]  of all salvation
[5027.22 --> 5027.82]  that has been
[5027.82 --> 5028.52]  granted by
[5028.52 --> 5029.64]  God's mercy.
[5030.60 --> 5031.06]  That's the
[5031.06 --> 5031.76]  second question
[5031.76 --> 5033.12]  of our
[5033.12 --> 5033.48]  text.
[5033.68 --> 5035.02]  How are
[5035.02 --> 5035.60]  they saved?
[5036.22 --> 5036.60]  And here's
[5036.60 --> 5036.92]  where I want
[5036.92 --> 5037.52]  you to
[5037.52 --> 5039.22]  unpack that
[5039.22 --> 5039.74]  line from
[5039.74 --> 5040.40]  verse 23.
[5040.56 --> 5040.80]  Remember,
[5040.96 --> 5041.42]  Paul said,
[5041.80 --> 5042.24]  if they do
[5042.24 --> 5043.04]  not persist
[5043.04 --> 5044.12]  in unbelief,
[5044.74 --> 5045.20]  they will be
[5045.20 --> 5045.74]  grafted in.
[5047.16 --> 5047.60]  Now,
[5047.72 --> 5048.30]  let me remind
[5048.30 --> 5048.54]  you,
[5048.62 --> 5049.38]  we've already
[5049.38 --> 5050.16]  agreed on the
[5050.16 --> 5051.12]  assumption that
[5051.12 --> 5051.90]  Paul wouldn't
[5051.90 --> 5052.98]  contradict himself
[5052.98 --> 5054.02]  in this section,
[5054.16 --> 5055.08]  nor would Paul
[5055.08 --> 5055.94]  contradict other
[5055.94 --> 5056.78]  parts of his
[5056.78 --> 5057.30]  letter to the
[5057.30 --> 5057.56]  Romans,
[5057.66 --> 5058.32]  or the rest of
[5058.32 --> 5058.80]  his letters,
[5058.98 --> 5059.68]  or the New
[5059.68 --> 5060.70]  Testament more
[5060.70 --> 5061.10]  generally.
[5062.20 --> 5062.60]  And so,
[5062.74 --> 5063.06]  remember,
[5063.22 --> 5063.82]  even when Paul
[5063.82 --> 5064.52]  says in chapter
[5064.52 --> 5064.88]  9,
[5064.96 --> 5065.48]  verse 8,
[5065.58 --> 5066.00]  it is the
[5066.00 --> 5066.46]  children of
[5066.46 --> 5066.94]  the promise
[5066.94 --> 5067.28]  who are
[5067.28 --> 5067.84]  Abraham's
[5067.84 --> 5068.32]  descendants,
[5069.14 --> 5069.30]  right?
[5069.42 --> 5070.28]  The promise
[5070.28 --> 5071.16]  has to be
[5071.16 --> 5072.90]  believed for
[5072.90 --> 5073.28]  it to be
[5073.28 --> 5073.76]  effective.
[5075.56 --> 5076.02]  In chapter
[5076.02 --> 5076.56]  4,
[5076.94 --> 5077.60]  we read,
[5078.14 --> 5079.00]  or you can
[5079.00 --> 5079.40]  read,
[5080.04 --> 5080.62]  for verse
[5080.62 --> 5081.10]  16,
[5081.32 --> 5081.74]  it says,
[5081.86 --> 5082.44]  the promise
[5082.44 --> 5083.12]  comes by
[5083.12 --> 5083.72]  faith,
[5084.00 --> 5084.68]  so that it
[5084.68 --> 5085.22]  may be by
[5085.22 --> 5085.86]  grace and
[5085.86 --> 5086.12]  may be
[5086.12 --> 5086.94]  guaranteed to
[5086.94 --> 5088.24]  all Abraham's
[5088.24 --> 5088.64]  offspring,
[5089.04 --> 5089.82]  not only those
[5089.82 --> 5090.34]  who have the
[5090.34 --> 5090.62]  law,
[5090.76 --> 5092.16]  but also those
[5092.16 --> 5092.80]  who have the
[5092.80 --> 5093.40]  faith of
[5093.40 --> 5093.80]  Abraham.
[5094.12 --> 5095.08]  He is the
[5095.08 --> 5096.08]  father of
[5096.08 --> 5096.62]  us all.
[5097.56 --> 5098.22]  The promise
[5098.22 --> 5099.04]  is believed
[5099.04 --> 5100.06]  by faith as
[5100.06 --> 5101.46]  a result of
[5101.46 --> 5102.30]  grace.
[5103.20 --> 5103.74]  And again,
[5104.12 --> 5104.56]  Paul's not
[5104.56 --> 5104.84]  going to
[5104.84 --> 5105.86]  contradict himself,
[5106.02 --> 5106.24]  right?
[5106.64 --> 5107.64]  Even in other
[5107.64 --> 5108.56]  letters that he
[5108.56 --> 5108.90]  has written.
[5110.08 --> 5110.44]  And so,
[5110.64 --> 5111.42]  let's continue
[5111.42 --> 5111.84]  to let
[5111.84 --> 5112.22]  Scripture
[5112.22 --> 5113.54]  interpret Scripture.
[5113.68 --> 5114.06]  Whenever you
[5114.06 --> 5114.64]  are studying the
[5114.64 --> 5115.06]  Bible and you
[5115.06 --> 5115.62]  have a question,
[5115.72 --> 5116.16]  what on earth
[5116.16 --> 5116.76]  does it mean
[5116.76 --> 5118.72]  look for other
[5118.72 --> 5119.48]  places in the
[5119.48 --> 5120.06]  Bible where it's
[5120.06 --> 5121.04]  talked about and
[5121.04 --> 5121.96]  you can begin
[5121.96 --> 5122.84]  to understand.
[5123.68 --> 5125.08]  In Galatians 3,
[5125.28 --> 5126.16]  verse 7,
[5126.54 --> 5127.34]  another letter of
[5127.34 --> 5127.68]  Paul,
[5128.02 --> 5128.82]  we read,
[5129.88 --> 5130.90]  understand then
[5130.90 --> 5131.78]  those who have
[5131.78 --> 5132.86]  faith are the
[5132.86 --> 5133.56]  children of
[5133.56 --> 5133.90]  Abraham.
[5134.50 --> 5135.02]  And then later
[5135.02 --> 5135.64]  down in verse
[5135.64 --> 5136.14]  29,
[5136.58 --> 5137.52]  if you belong to
[5137.52 --> 5137.98]  Christ,
[5138.10 --> 5138.56]  then you are
[5138.56 --> 5139.80]  Abraham's seed and
[5139.80 --> 5141.10]  heirs according to
[5141.10 --> 5141.62]  the promise.
[5141.74 --> 5141.96]  And so,
[5142.18 --> 5143.24]  start stacking these
[5143.24 --> 5144.24]  things together.
[5144.24 --> 5144.32]  together.
[5145.52 --> 5145.94]  It is the
[5145.94 --> 5146.70]  grace of God
[5146.70 --> 5147.26]  or the mercy
[5147.26 --> 5147.90]  of God that
[5147.90 --> 5148.82]  grants faith in
[5148.82 --> 5149.70]  the promises of
[5149.70 --> 5150.74]  God that then
[5150.74 --> 5152.12]  unites you to
[5152.12 --> 5153.12]  Christ, that makes
[5153.12 --> 5154.68]  you belong to
[5154.68 --> 5155.34]  him.
[5155.42 --> 5156.00]  And it is the
[5156.00 --> 5156.94]  belonging to
[5156.94 --> 5158.20]  Christ that
[5158.20 --> 5158.74]  saves you.
[5158.82 --> 5159.22]  It is the
[5159.22 --> 5160.02]  living and
[5160.02 --> 5161.16]  loving Jesus
[5161.16 --> 5162.12]  and the living
[5162.12 --> 5163.08]  and loving of
[5163.08 --> 5164.12]  Jesus that
[5164.12 --> 5164.88]  brings salvation.
[5166.04 --> 5166.46]  And again,
[5166.98 --> 5167.64]  Paul's not going
[5167.64 --> 5168.52]  to contradict the
[5168.52 --> 5169.14]  rest of the New
[5169.14 --> 5169.78]  Testament.
[5169.98 --> 5170.30]  And so,
[5170.42 --> 5171.20]  you can actually
[5171.20 --> 5172.28]  dig even further
[5172.28 --> 5173.36]  and find agreement
[5173.36 --> 5174.20]  with this truth
[5174.20 --> 5175.20]  also from the
[5175.20 --> 5175.90]  very words of
[5175.90 --> 5177.00]  Jesus himself.
[5177.98 --> 5178.86]  In John 8,
[5178.94 --> 5179.60]  verse 39,
[5180.66 --> 5181.14]  and I won't
[5181.14 --> 5181.60]  read the whole
[5181.60 --> 5182.06]  thing, but you
[5182.06 --> 5182.44]  can write it
[5182.44 --> 5183.20]  down, John 8,
[5183.28 --> 5184.24]  39, and look
[5184.24 --> 5184.56]  it up.
[5184.70 --> 5185.44]  I'll paraphrase.
[5186.08 --> 5186.88]  Jesus makes
[5186.88 --> 5188.04]  clear using this
[5188.04 --> 5188.96]  language that the
[5188.96 --> 5189.96]  true descendants
[5189.96 --> 5191.28]  of Father Abraham
[5191.28 --> 5192.64]  are the ones who
[5192.64 --> 5194.04]  do his, Jesus,
[5194.48 --> 5195.78]  and God's, his
[5195.78 --> 5196.74]  father's, will.
[5197.42 --> 5198.06]  The ones who
[5198.06 --> 5199.58]  recognize in Jesus
[5199.58 --> 5200.56]  the one true
[5200.56 --> 5201.66]  son loved by the
[5201.66 --> 5202.70]  father and who
[5202.70 --> 5203.82]  therefore love
[5203.82 --> 5204.86]  Jesus.
[5206.78 --> 5207.40]  Throughout this
[5207.40 --> 5208.16]  whole section,
[5208.38 --> 5208.72]  throughout this
[5208.72 --> 5209.52]  whole letter of
[5209.52 --> 5210.24]  Romans, throughout
[5210.24 --> 5211.08]  the whole New
[5211.08 --> 5212.30]  Testament, you can
[5212.30 --> 5213.64]  see that it is
[5213.64 --> 5215.38]  God's choosing by
[5215.38 --> 5216.20]  grace.
[5218.18 --> 5219.18]  We've seen this
[5219.18 --> 5220.24]  and you can read
[5220.24 --> 5221.92]  it in Ephesians 2,
[5222.04 --> 5222.52]  verse 8.
[5223.40 --> 5224.42]  For it is by grace
[5224.42 --> 5225.74]  you have been
[5225.74 --> 5226.70]  saved through
[5226.70 --> 5227.34]  faith.
[5227.98 --> 5228.62]  And this is not
[5228.62 --> 5229.22]  from yourselves,
[5229.32 --> 5230.22]  it is the gift of
[5230.22 --> 5231.46]  God, not by works,
[5231.46 --> 5232.22]  so that no one
[5232.22 --> 5233.14]  can boast.
[5234.66 --> 5235.42]  Back in chapter
[5235.42 --> 5236.32]  10 of Romans,
[5236.58 --> 5237.28]  you read,
[5237.54 --> 5238.34]  if you declare
[5238.34 --> 5239.08]  with your mouth
[5239.08 --> 5240.10]  Jesus is Lord
[5240.10 --> 5240.98]  and believe in
[5240.98 --> 5241.70]  your heart God
[5241.70 --> 5242.24]  raised him from
[5242.24 --> 5242.64]  the dead,
[5242.78 --> 5243.94]  you will be
[5243.94 --> 5244.72]  saved.
[5246.12 --> 5247.30]  And all of
[5247.30 --> 5249.42]  that doesn't
[5249.42 --> 5251.60]  change when it
[5251.60 --> 5253.12]  comes to
[5253.12 --> 5253.58]  Israel.
[5255.12 --> 5256.14]  The way of
[5256.14 --> 5257.26]  salvation doesn't
[5257.26 --> 5258.34]  change for Israel
[5258.34 --> 5258.76]  Israel who
[5258.76 --> 5259.96]  will come and
[5259.96 --> 5260.82]  are coming to
[5260.82 --> 5261.42]  believe its
[5261.42 --> 5262.30]  truth and who
[5262.30 --> 5263.26]  will recognize
[5263.26 --> 5264.26]  Jesus as their
[5264.26 --> 5265.38]  Messiah and the
[5265.38 --> 5265.60]  Lord.
[5265.78 --> 5266.86]  Belief is what
[5266.86 --> 5267.80]  is required.
[5268.08 --> 5268.94]  Faith is
[5268.94 --> 5270.00]  granted to the
[5270.00 --> 5270.30]  elect.
[5270.42 --> 5271.20]  The same is
[5271.20 --> 5272.20]  true and will
[5272.20 --> 5273.16]  be true for the
[5273.16 --> 5274.06]  Israelites who
[5274.06 --> 5274.40]  believe.
[5274.54 --> 5275.54]  That's why in
[5275.54 --> 5276.80]  chapter 11, at the
[5276.80 --> 5277.82]  beginning, Paul uses
[5277.82 --> 5278.84]  himself as an
[5278.84 --> 5279.70]  example of this
[5279.70 --> 5280.02]  truth.
[5280.90 --> 5283.14]  For faith, for
[5283.14 --> 5284.50]  God's gift, we
[5284.50 --> 5285.70]  read, which is
[5285.70 --> 5286.70]  faith and his
[5286.70 --> 5287.52]  call, that is
[5287.52 --> 5288.52]  to believe and
[5288.52 --> 5289.48]  the belief itself,
[5289.88 --> 5291.26]  for God's gift and
[5291.26 --> 5292.70]  his call are
[5292.70 --> 5293.42]  irrevocable.
[5296.70 --> 5298.28]  And, like we
[5298.28 --> 5299.94]  read in chapter
[5299.94 --> 5301.12]  9, 15, I will
[5301.12 --> 5301.94]  have mercy on
[5301.94 --> 5302.44]  whom I have
[5302.44 --> 5302.82]  mercy.
[5303.56 --> 5303.94]  It does not
[5303.94 --> 5304.60]  therefore depend
[5304.60 --> 5305.48]  on human desire
[5305.48 --> 5306.46]  or effort, but
[5306.46 --> 5307.74]  on God's
[5307.74 --> 5308.48]  mercy.
[5309.90 --> 5311.68]  The future and
[5311.68 --> 5313.14]  emerging salvation
[5313.14 --> 5314.06]  of Israel doesn't
[5314.06 --> 5315.04]  depend on their
[5315.04 --> 5316.32]  effort, but on
[5316.32 --> 5317.50]  God's mercy.
[5318.92 --> 5319.68]  And thus, it
[5319.68 --> 5321.14]  seems to me, as
[5321.14 --> 5322.06]  we continue then
[5322.06 --> 5323.22]  plotting our way
[5323.22 --> 5324.32]  through, verse 30
[5324.32 --> 5326.08]  and 31, tell the
[5326.08 --> 5328.24]  story of how God
[5328.24 --> 5330.00]  used Israel's
[5330.00 --> 5331.14]  unbelief to
[5331.14 --> 5332.64]  spur or to
[5332.64 --> 5333.94]  instigate
[5333.94 --> 5335.58]  Gentile belief,
[5335.84 --> 5336.88]  thereby including
[5336.88 --> 5338.60]  them, Gentiles, as
[5338.60 --> 5339.34]  heirs of the
[5339.34 --> 5339.92]  promise, as
[5339.92 --> 5341.36]  seeds of Abraham,
[5341.36 --> 5343.00]  and then how God
[5343.00 --> 5344.54]  will in turn do
[5344.54 --> 5345.58]  the same with
[5345.58 --> 5346.44]  the Gentiles
[5346.44 --> 5347.60]  back to or
[5347.60 --> 5349.32]  for Israel, so
[5349.32 --> 5350.56]  that they, Israel,
[5350.78 --> 5351.98]  will believe and
[5351.98 --> 5353.32]  have faith from
[5353.32 --> 5354.30]  the mercy and
[5354.30 --> 5355.26]  grace of God.
[5355.80 --> 5356.86]  The means of
[5356.86 --> 5357.76]  their coming to
[5357.76 --> 5359.08]  belief and faith
[5359.08 --> 5360.80]  at some point is,
[5361.00 --> 5362.28]  in fact, their
[5362.28 --> 5363.92]  rejection of Jesus
[5363.92 --> 5365.28]  in his own day,
[5365.34 --> 5366.46]  or in Paul's day,
[5366.80 --> 5368.58]  because, what Paul is
[5368.58 --> 5369.62]  saying, God will
[5369.62 --> 5371.40]  use the Gentiles
[5371.40 --> 5372.90]  who professed faith
[5372.90 --> 5374.34]  and received mercy
[5374.34 --> 5375.46]  and grace to
[5375.46 --> 5377.04]  move the chosen
[5377.04 --> 5378.54]  of ethnic Israel
[5378.54 --> 5379.64]  back to him.
[5380.70 --> 5381.86]  That's the mystery.
[5382.96 --> 5384.34]  That's the amazing
[5384.34 --> 5385.84]  grace of God, and
[5385.84 --> 5386.86]  to be clear, it's
[5386.86 --> 5387.92]  no wonder that as
[5387.92 --> 5388.88]  Paul walks through
[5388.88 --> 5390.08]  this, he ends and
[5390.08 --> 5391.02]  breaks out in a big
[5391.02 --> 5392.36]  hymn of praise, and
[5392.36 --> 5392.84]  we'll look at that
[5392.84 --> 5393.36]  next time.
[5394.22 --> 5396.08]  But this moving
[5396.08 --> 5397.40]  through in the
[5397.40 --> 5398.72]  history of redemption
[5398.72 --> 5401.00]  is what Michael
[5401.00 --> 5402.50]  Byrd calls the
[5402.50 --> 5403.50]  boomerang of
[5403.50 --> 5404.92]  salvation, and I
[5404.92 --> 5405.34]  think that's a
[5405.34 --> 5406.18]  cool image.
[5406.26 --> 5406.70]  It helps me
[5406.70 --> 5407.44]  understand what's
[5407.44 --> 5407.96]  going on.
[5408.26 --> 5409.78]  The gospel goes
[5409.78 --> 5411.96]  out because of
[5411.96 --> 5413.40]  Jewish rejection,
[5414.04 --> 5415.02]  and so the
[5415.02 --> 5416.28]  Gentiles receive
[5416.28 --> 5417.92]  salvation, and
[5417.92 --> 5418.72]  it's the Gentiles
[5418.72 --> 5420.36]  receiving mercy and
[5420.36 --> 5421.74]  believing, then,
[5421.86 --> 5422.78]  that will be used
[5422.78 --> 5423.60]  by God that will
[5423.60 --> 5425.28]  come back to have
[5425.28 --> 5426.26]  the Jewish people
[5426.26 --> 5427.88]  receive mercy and
[5427.88 --> 5428.26]  believe.
[5429.16 --> 5430.20]  That's verse 31.
[5430.40 --> 5431.74]  So they, too, have
[5431.74 --> 5433.24]  now become disobedient
[5433.24 --> 5434.10]  in order that they,
[5434.24 --> 5435.58]  too, may now receive
[5435.58 --> 5437.30]  mercy as a result of
[5437.30 --> 5439.46]  God's mercy on you.
[5441.12 --> 5443.60]  But in both cases, for
[5443.60 --> 5444.80]  Gentiles and for
[5444.80 --> 5446.06]  Israel, it is
[5446.06 --> 5446.58]  belief.
[5446.86 --> 5448.44]  It is right belief in
[5448.44 --> 5450.32]  Jesus as Messiah, as
[5450.32 --> 5451.70]  Lord, as the Son of
[5451.70 --> 5452.98]  God, as raised from
[5452.98 --> 5454.02]  the dead, that is
[5454.02 --> 5455.18]  necessary for
[5455.18 --> 5455.64]  salvation.
[5456.32 --> 5457.12]  There's not some
[5457.12 --> 5458.86]  new or third way or
[5458.86 --> 5460.26]  some loophole for
[5460.26 --> 5461.44]  ethnic Israel to get
[5461.44 --> 5461.70]  in.
[5461.86 --> 5462.92]  They must believe.
[5463.96 --> 5465.28]  And in fact, they
[5465.28 --> 5466.96]  will believe because
[5466.96 --> 5467.76]  God's plan of
[5467.76 --> 5468.66]  redemption will not
[5468.66 --> 5470.38]  be thwarted even by
[5470.38 --> 5472.30]  the rejection of
[5472.30 --> 5473.68]  Israel or by the
[5473.68 --> 5475.52]  rejection of anyone.
[5476.52 --> 5477.64]  Part of the amazing
[5477.64 --> 5479.12]  thing that Paul is
[5479.12 --> 5480.40]  telling us is that
[5480.40 --> 5483.80]  there will be more of
[5483.80 --> 5485.94]  them who believe than
[5485.94 --> 5487.14]  we could by looking at
[5487.14 --> 5488.02]  the world around us
[5488.02 --> 5489.08]  now or that Paul could
[5489.08 --> 5489.70]  by looking at the
[5489.70 --> 5490.50]  world around him then
[5490.50 --> 5491.70]  than he could possibly
[5491.70 --> 5492.20]  imagine.
[5493.94 --> 5494.06]  Right?
[5494.10 --> 5494.98]  Paul's reason for
[5494.98 --> 5495.74]  hope and his
[5495.74 --> 5497.02]  confidence that they
[5497.02 --> 5498.26]  will believe is rooted
[5498.26 --> 5499.48]  in the fact that God's
[5499.48 --> 5501.76]  promise and in the
[5501.76 --> 5503.42]  truth of God's call
[5503.42 --> 5505.52]  and in the reality that
[5505.52 --> 5507.30]  God's word does not go
[5507.30 --> 5508.16]  out without
[5508.16 --> 5510.04]  accomplishing, or does not
[5510.04 --> 5510.78]  come back to him
[5510.78 --> 5511.88]  without accomplishing the
[5511.88 --> 5513.54]  purposes for which it
[5513.54 --> 5514.24]  was sent.
[5515.46 --> 5515.56]  Right?
[5515.68 --> 5517.26]  Just as the fullness of
[5517.26 --> 5518.86]  Gentiles will come to
[5518.86 --> 5520.28]  God, so too the fullness
[5520.28 --> 5522.38]  or all Israel will
[5522.38 --> 5524.82]  receive God's mercy and
[5524.82 --> 5525.50]  believe.
[5526.48 --> 5528.08]  This is the picture of
[5528.08 --> 5529.88]  full inclusion, of full
[5529.88 --> 5531.92]  equality before God.
[5532.64 --> 5533.84]  That's verse 32 now.
[5534.42 --> 5535.36]  For God has bound
[5535.36 --> 5536.74]  everyone over to
[5536.74 --> 5537.76]  disobedience, that is
[5537.76 --> 5539.14]  Gentile and Jew alike,
[5539.24 --> 5540.76]  everyone over, so that he
[5540.76 --> 5542.90]  might have mercy on all
[5542.90 --> 5544.16]  of them, that is Gentile
[5544.16 --> 5545.84]  and Jew together by
[5545.84 --> 5546.72]  grace through faith.
[5547.64 --> 5547.86]  Right?
[5547.88 --> 5548.70]  Or to paraphrase it
[5548.70 --> 5550.62]  another way, all
[5550.62 --> 5552.60]  peoples, both Gentiles
[5552.60 --> 5553.74]  and Jews, have been
[5553.74 --> 5555.82]  disobedient and yet all
[5555.82 --> 5557.18]  peoples from the
[5557.18 --> 5558.26]  Gentiles and from the
[5558.26 --> 5560.12]  Jews will be found by
[5560.12 --> 5561.30]  God's mercy.
[5562.44 --> 5563.90]  God's mercy comes
[5563.90 --> 5565.38]  without distinction,
[5566.66 --> 5568.96]  but not without
[5568.96 --> 5569.90]  exception.
[5570.76 --> 5572.52]  because Jesus is still
[5572.52 --> 5574.24]  true when he says,
[5574.44 --> 5575.66]  no one comes to the
[5575.66 --> 5577.14]  Father except
[5577.14 --> 5579.40]  through me.
[5581.22 --> 5582.26]  Now I get
[5582.26 --> 5584.20]  that that's a lot
[5584.20 --> 5586.28]  and that's heavy.
[5586.92 --> 5588.16]  So I want to land this
[5588.16 --> 5590.28]  plane really quickly
[5590.28 --> 5592.70]  with just a couple
[5592.70 --> 5594.92]  points of application.
[5594.92 --> 5596.86]  first of all, first of all,
[5597.42 --> 5597.96]  first of all, remember,
[5598.68 --> 5601.12]  in chapter 11,
[5602.36 --> 5604.90]  Paul is encouraging the
[5604.90 --> 5606.30]  Gentile Christians who
[5606.30 --> 5608.56]  believe and who are
[5608.56 --> 5610.46]  experiencing the rejection
[5610.46 --> 5613.02]  of Israel to not be
[5613.02 --> 5614.48]  conceited or proud.
[5614.60 --> 5616.10]  He's encouraging them to
[5616.10 --> 5616.98]  have humility.
[5617.80 --> 5618.12]  Right?
[5618.18 --> 5619.44]  The point of Paul's call
[5619.44 --> 5622.02]  here is humility for
[5622.02 --> 5622.92]  Gentile believers.
[5622.92 --> 5623.02]  believers.
[5624.08 --> 5624.54]  And so,
[5625.30 --> 5627.06]  as we make a
[5627.06 --> 5628.12]  pastoral application,
[5629.28 --> 5630.32]  whether you are born
[5630.32 --> 5631.56]  in a Christian home
[5631.56 --> 5632.68]  to loving Christian
[5632.68 --> 5633.92]  parents who brought
[5633.92 --> 5634.80]  you to church for
[5634.80 --> 5636.90]  baptism before you
[5636.90 --> 5638.18]  were three weeks old,
[5638.30 --> 5639.52]  just two weeks old,
[5640.10 --> 5643.78]  or if you're dealing
[5643.78 --> 5645.08]  drugs and murdering
[5645.08 --> 5646.08]  people on the streets,
[5646.08 --> 5648.60]  it's all the amazing
[5648.60 --> 5649.40]  grace of God.
[5655.00 --> 5655.96]  And so,
[5656.90 --> 5661.10]  practice humility
[5661.10 --> 5664.26]  with deep gratitude.
[5665.80 --> 5667.12]  With deep gratitude
[5667.12 --> 5668.46]  and a worshiping heart
[5668.46 --> 5670.62]  for what God has done.
[5670.62 --> 5672.64]  And then two,
[5672.90 --> 5673.28]  remember,
[5673.62 --> 5674.74]  that nothing,
[5675.52 --> 5677.68]  not even stubbornness
[5677.68 --> 5678.84]  or rejection,
[5679.54 --> 5680.72]  is going to thwart
[5680.72 --> 5682.02]  God's plan of salvation.
[5684.12 --> 5685.38]  That there is nothing
[5685.38 --> 5687.92]  that you can do
[5687.92 --> 5688.88]  that will stop
[5688.88 --> 5690.06]  God's mercy
[5690.06 --> 5691.20]  from overcoming it.
[5691.20 --> 5696.10]  God has decreed
[5696.10 --> 5697.58]  that some
[5697.58 --> 5698.58]  would be
[5698.58 --> 5699.30]  saved
[5699.30 --> 5700.06]  and he
[5700.06 --> 5701.26]  will make
[5701.26 --> 5702.58]  that salvation
[5702.58 --> 5703.96]  come about.
[5704.18 --> 5705.22]  You can be
[5705.22 --> 5706.14]  sure
[5706.14 --> 5707.14]  of that.
[5707.86 --> 5708.28]  And so,
[5708.36 --> 5709.64]  even as you look
[5709.64 --> 5710.86]  at your life,
[5710.98 --> 5711.78]  even as you look
[5711.78 --> 5712.46]  at the lives
[5712.46 --> 5713.12]  of the people
[5713.12 --> 5713.98]  you love
[5713.98 --> 5714.70]  who maybe
[5714.70 --> 5715.92]  don't seem like
[5715.92 --> 5716.64]  they're following
[5716.64 --> 5717.44]  after God,
[5717.52 --> 5718.18]  who maybe aren't
[5718.18 --> 5719.50]  yet professing
[5719.50 --> 5720.74]  this truth,
[5721.94 --> 5724.36]  that doesn't mean
[5724.36 --> 5725.16]  they never will.
[5727.06 --> 5728.18]  Because God's
[5728.18 --> 5729.02]  plan of salvation
[5729.02 --> 5731.16]  will not be thwarted
[5731.16 --> 5732.74]  by anyone
[5732.74 --> 5734.10]  or anything
[5734.10 --> 5735.24]  in all
[5735.24 --> 5736.42]  of creation.
[5737.62 --> 5738.06]  And so,
[5738.58 --> 5739.78]  last or thirdly,
[5740.12 --> 5741.18]  take this as
[5741.18 --> 5741.66]  comfort
[5741.66 --> 5742.80]  and assurance
[5742.80 --> 5744.10]  into today.
[5744.26 --> 5744.90]  Take this as
[5744.90 --> 5745.90]  comfort and assurance
[5745.90 --> 5746.84]  into your
[5746.84 --> 5747.72]  raising of Jane.
[5748.18 --> 5750.18]  that God
[5750.18 --> 5750.78]  has a plan
[5750.78 --> 5751.32]  for her
[5751.32 --> 5752.08]  and that it
[5752.08 --> 5752.74]  will not be
[5752.74 --> 5753.20]  thwarted
[5753.20 --> 5754.12]  no matter how
[5754.12 --> 5755.08]  awesome of parents
[5755.08 --> 5755.52]  you are
[5755.52 --> 5756.40]  or how bad
[5756.40 --> 5757.02]  you are.
[5757.94 --> 5758.58]  No matter how
[5758.58 --> 5759.44]  well you bless
[5759.44 --> 5760.22]  them or how
[5760.22 --> 5761.42]  badly you
[5761.42 --> 5762.32]  traumatize them.
[5764.18 --> 5764.78]  God
[5764.78 --> 5765.58]  will not
[5765.58 --> 5766.06]  be
[5766.06 --> 5767.04]  overcome.
[5768.18 --> 5769.16]  He will
[5769.16 --> 5769.72]  overcome.
[5770.82 --> 5771.68]  And he has
[5771.68 --> 5772.22]  made those
[5772.22 --> 5772.96]  who believe
[5772.96 --> 5773.82]  overcomers.
[5775.42 --> 5776.16]  And then
[5776.16 --> 5776.54]  lastly,
[5776.76 --> 5777.28]  and I'm
[5777.28 --> 5777.60]  going to say
[5777.60 --> 5779.22]  most importantly,
[5780.30 --> 5780.96]  what this
[5780.96 --> 5781.82]  text does
[5781.82 --> 5782.70]  for us
[5782.70 --> 5783.76]  is undergird
[5783.76 --> 5784.82]  the absolute
[5784.82 --> 5786.10]  critical
[5786.10 --> 5787.26]  importance
[5787.26 --> 5788.86]  of God's
[5788.86 --> 5789.22]  mission
[5789.22 --> 5789.90]  through the
[5789.90 --> 5790.26]  church
[5790.26 --> 5791.16]  to all
[5791.16 --> 5791.54]  people.
[5792.58 --> 5793.52]  God's mission
[5793.52 --> 5793.94]  through the
[5793.94 --> 5794.16]  church
[5794.16 --> 5794.86]  to proclaim
[5794.86 --> 5795.48]  the gospel
[5795.48 --> 5796.38]  of Jesus
[5796.38 --> 5797.08]  Christ as
[5797.08 --> 5797.48]  Lord,
[5797.84 --> 5798.84]  raised from
[5798.84 --> 5799.24]  the dead,
[5799.48 --> 5800.00]  as Jesus
[5800.00 --> 5800.64]  Christ having
[5800.64 --> 5801.10]  lived the
[5801.10 --> 5801.64]  life I should
[5801.64 --> 5801.96]  have lived
[5801.96 --> 5802.44]  and dying
[5802.44 --> 5802.82]  the death
[5802.82 --> 5803.10]  that I
[5803.10 --> 5803.46]  deserve,
[5803.70 --> 5804.30]  as Jesus
[5804.30 --> 5804.76]  Christ,
[5804.86 --> 5805.60]  as Lord
[5805.60 --> 5806.16]  over all
[5806.16 --> 5806.74]  creation,
[5807.16 --> 5807.76]  proclaiming
[5807.76 --> 5808.74]  that truth
[5808.74 --> 5809.44]  to the
[5809.44 --> 5809.76]  world,
[5809.76 --> 5810.86]  so that by
[5810.86 --> 5811.44]  grace through
[5811.44 --> 5811.92]  faith,
[5812.60 --> 5813.52]  people might
[5813.52 --> 5814.48]  know and
[5814.48 --> 5815.00]  be saved.
[5815.66 --> 5817.18]  This undergirds
[5817.18 --> 5818.16]  our call to
[5818.16 --> 5819.08]  mission that
[5819.08 --> 5819.56]  the fullness
[5819.56 --> 5820.64]  of Gentiles
[5820.64 --> 5821.88]  and all
[5821.88 --> 5823.30]  Israel might
[5823.30 --> 5824.34]  believe.
[5825.12 --> 5826.24]  This is
[5826.24 --> 5827.74]  your call.
[5828.20 --> 5829.20]  This is your
[5829.20 --> 5829.68]  comfort,
[5830.02 --> 5830.66]  this is your
[5830.66 --> 5831.02]  care,
[5831.02 --> 5831.78]  and this
[5831.78 --> 5832.38]  is your
[5832.38 --> 5833.10]  burden,
[5833.38 --> 5833.76]  to go
[5833.76 --> 5834.68]  forth and
[5834.68 --> 5835.74]  proclaim the
[5835.74 --> 5836.84]  gospel of
[5836.84 --> 5838.00]  Jesus Christ.
[5838.90 --> 5839.60]  No one
[5839.60 --> 5840.14]  comes to
[5840.14 --> 5840.64]  the Father
[5840.64 --> 5842.28]  except through
[5842.28 --> 5843.08]  him.
[5843.58 --> 5843.88]  Amen?
[5844.64 --> 5845.50]  Let's pray
[5845.50 --> 5845.82]  together.
[5848.42 --> 5850.08]  Lord Jesus,
[5850.58 --> 5852.00]  our God.
[5852.38 --> 5853.20]  Lord Jesus,
[5853.86 --> 5854.68]  our Savior.

[5860.26 --> 5861.14]  and friend,
[5862.64 --> 5864.20]  send us out
[5864.20 --> 5865.34]  in the sure
[5865.34 --> 5866.74]  conviction and
[5866.74 --> 5867.64]  assurance that
[5867.64 --> 5868.96]  nothing will
[5868.96 --> 5870.20]  thwart God's
[5870.20 --> 5871.12]  plan of
[5871.12 --> 5871.48]  redemption.
[5872.84 --> 5873.80]  Send us out
[5873.80 --> 5874.52]  in the assurance
[5874.52 --> 5875.60]  that the
[5875.60 --> 5876.18]  Father has
[5876.18 --> 5876.90]  given to you,
[5877.04 --> 5877.52]  Lord Jesus,
[5877.72 --> 5878.92]  all those whom
[5878.92 --> 5879.82]  are written in
[5879.82 --> 5880.26]  the book of
[5880.26 --> 5880.98]  life, and you
[5880.98 --> 5882.08]  will not lose
[5882.08 --> 5883.20]  a single one.
[5883.20 --> 5886.06]  send us out
[5886.06 --> 5887.34]  with that
[5887.34 --> 5888.30]  mission to
[5888.30 --> 5888.98]  proclaim the
[5888.98 --> 5889.58]  truth of the
[5889.58 --> 5890.56]  gospel that
[5890.56 --> 5891.90]  all might come
[5891.90 --> 5892.82]  to see and
[5892.82 --> 5894.22]  know who
[5894.22 --> 5894.82]  you are,
[5895.40 --> 5896.04]  what you have
[5896.04 --> 5896.90]  done, what
[5896.90 --> 5897.76]  you will do,
[5898.12 --> 5899.04]  and how it
[5899.04 --> 5899.82]  is that you
[5899.82 --> 5900.36]  will carry
[5900.36 --> 5901.88]  history through
[5901.88 --> 5903.12]  to completion so
[5903.12 --> 5903.68]  that in all
[5903.68 --> 5904.70]  things you
[5904.70 --> 5905.64]  might be
[5905.64 --> 5906.48]  glorified.
[5907.04 --> 5907.74]  In Jesus'
[5908.08 --> 5908.56]  name we
[5908.56 --> 5908.88]  pray.
[5909.52 --> 5909.92]  Amen.
