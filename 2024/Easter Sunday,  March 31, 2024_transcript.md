[2399.66 --> 2429.64]  Thank you.
[2429.66 --> 2459.64]  Thank you.
[2459.66 --> 2489.64]  Thank you.
[2489.64 --> 2519.62]  Thank you.
[2519.62 --> 2549.60]  Thank you.
[2549.60 --> 2579.58]  Thank you.
[2579.60 --> 2609.58]  And each one.
[2609.58 --> 2639.56]  Thank you.
[2639.56 --> 2641.56]  And you guys are ready.
[2669.56 --> 2699.54]  Thank you.
[2699.56 --> 2729.54]  Thank you.
[2729.54 --> 2759.52]  Father, it's a good day.
[2759.52 --> 2789.52]  Thank you.
[2789.52 --> 2819.50]  Sunday.
[2819.52 --> 2849.50]  Thank you.
[2849.50 --> 2879.48]  Father, we pray.
[2879.48 --> 2909.46]  We also give you,
[2909.46 --> 2939.44]  Eli's off they and you Just like,
[2939.44 --> 2941.50]  Jesus' love and sacrifice for us.
[2943.28 --> 2945.84]  Now to you who is able to keep us from falling,
[2946.10 --> 2948.78]  be glory, majesty, power, and authority
[2948.78 --> 2950.72]  through Jesus Christ our Lord
[2950.72 --> 2953.62]  before all ages, now, and forevermore.
[2954.36 --> 2954.66]  Amen.
[2969.44 --> 2974.96]  If you have a Bible,
[2975.42 --> 2978.26]  or if you have a device on which you read your Bible,
[2978.32 --> 2981.88]  I'm going to invite you to open that up or turn that on.
[2981.88 --> 2985.18]  We're going to read from Matthew 28,
[2985.50 --> 2988.30]  verse 1 through 10 together this morning.
[2990.32 --> 2992.02]  Before we do that,
[2994.42 --> 2997.82]  Easter Sunday, Resurrection Sunday,
[2997.82 --> 3000.66]  is, I say this every year, I think,
[3000.76 --> 3003.50]  my favorite Sunday of the year.
[3003.82 --> 3005.50]  My favorite day of the year.
[3006.08 --> 3009.66]  It is a beautiful time to gather
[3009.66 --> 3012.00]  and to celebrate and to remember,
[3012.36 --> 3015.58]  and it's also the seasons changing,
[3015.98 --> 3019.18]  and the sun is shining just a little bit brightened,
[3019.40 --> 3021.38]  even if there was frost this morning.
[3022.46 --> 3025.20]  It's not like in Ontario, where I used to live,
[3025.24 --> 3026.80]  where there was snow this week.
[3027.82 --> 3030.42]  Here we have cherry blossoms blooming
[3030.42 --> 3032.10]  and flowers coming up.
[3032.16 --> 3034.12]  It is just a lovely season.
[3034.32 --> 3036.62]  And on this Sunday, of all Sundays,
[3036.74 --> 3039.28]  the bright colors come out again
[3039.28 --> 3041.70]  as everyone wears that to church.
[3041.78 --> 3045.00]  It is just a good time to be here.
[3045.70 --> 3046.68]  And on Easter Sunday,
[3047.16 --> 3051.88]  we once again rehearse the story of our faith.
[3051.88 --> 3056.88]  We rehearse the story of the whole drama of redemption.
[3058.02 --> 3059.34]  Now, the truth is, of course,
[3059.48 --> 3062.68]  every Sunday, that's what we're doing in our worship.
[3063.44 --> 3067.62]  Every Sunday, we are rehearsing Resurrection Sunday.
[3068.16 --> 3068.62]  Right?
[3068.70 --> 3071.46]  We come in our darkness and need.
[3071.72 --> 3074.08]  We come confessing our sin to God
[3074.08 --> 3076.22]  who invites us into his presence,
[3076.22 --> 3080.38]  and we receive from him a word of hope
[3080.38 --> 3081.68]  and a word of life.
[3081.82 --> 3084.98]  We receive from him newness in spirit.
[3085.18 --> 3087.42]  We are raised up with him
[3087.42 --> 3091.00]  and then sent out on mission to proclaim this truth.
[3091.16 --> 3092.96]  That's what we do every Sunday
[3092.96 --> 3096.40]  because of what happens today,
[3097.24 --> 3101.32]  because of what we remember and reflect on today.
[3101.32 --> 3105.32]  And so today, explicitly and intentionally,
[3105.76 --> 3110.38]  we are going to rehearse the resurrection story.
[3112.24 --> 3116.00]  I'm going to read Matthew 28 for you.
[3118.82 --> 3122.84]  After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week,
[3123.08 --> 3125.12]  Mary Magdalene and the other Mary
[3125.12 --> 3126.84]  went to look at the tomb.
[3128.00 --> 3129.46]  There was a violent earthquake,
[3129.46 --> 3131.88]  for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven
[3131.88 --> 3133.42]  and going to the tomb,
[3133.60 --> 3135.90]  rolled back the stone and sat on it.
[3136.78 --> 3138.52]  His appearance was like lightning
[3138.52 --> 3140.30]  and his clothes were white as snow.
[3140.66 --> 3142.48]  The guards were so afraid of him
[3142.48 --> 3144.90]  that they shook and became like dead men.
[3146.04 --> 3147.56]  The angel said to the women,
[3148.80 --> 3149.86]  Do not be afraid,
[3150.28 --> 3152.08]  for I know that you are looking for Jesus
[3152.08 --> 3153.00]  who was crucified.
[3153.46 --> 3154.76]  He is not here.
[3155.14 --> 3156.88]  He has risen just as he said.
[3157.20 --> 3159.32]  Come and see the place where he lay.
[3159.46 --> 3161.84]  Then go quickly and tell his disciples,
[3162.00 --> 3163.24]  He has risen from the dead
[3163.24 --> 3165.42]  and is going ahead of you into Galilee.
[3165.84 --> 3166.94]  There you will see him.
[3167.92 --> 3169.12]  Now I have told you.
[3170.18 --> 3172.64]  And so the women hurried away from the tomb,
[3172.80 --> 3175.18]  afraid and yet filled with joy,
[3175.64 --> 3177.34]  and ran to tell his disciples.
[3178.92 --> 3181.04]  Suddenly, Jesus met them.
[3181.04 --> 3182.04]  Greetings, he said.
[3182.04 --> 3183.98]  Greetings, he said.
[3184.98 --> 3186.32]  They came to him,
[3186.92 --> 3188.16]  clasped his feet,
[3188.30 --> 3189.96]  and worshipped him.
[3190.84 --> 3192.40]  And then Jesus said to them,
[3192.58 --> 3194.98]  Do not be afraid.
[3195.92 --> 3199.32]  Go, tell my brothers to go to Galilee.
[3200.06 --> 3202.14]  There they will see me.
[3202.82 --> 3204.06]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3204.06 --> 3215.08]  The reason why we rehearse Resurrection Sunday,
[3215.34 --> 3216.48]  every Sunday,
[3217.06 --> 3220.82]  is because of the truth that says,
[3221.32 --> 3223.28]  If God is not dead,
[3224.08 --> 3226.28]  there is nothing to fear.
[3226.28 --> 3230.72]  Dave made note that on Good Friday,
[3230.92 --> 3231.66]  when we gathered,
[3232.28 --> 3234.60]  we heard and lived into the truth
[3234.60 --> 3236.00]  that God is dead,
[3236.08 --> 3237.96]  and we have killed him.
[3238.08 --> 3239.66]  But Sunday has come,
[3239.72 --> 3242.64]  and something has changed.
[3243.90 --> 3245.62]  And that thing that has changed
[3245.62 --> 3247.58]  is that the God who died
[3247.58 --> 3251.44]  has been raised to new life again.
[3251.44 --> 3254.16]  And if God's not dead,
[3254.74 --> 3257.34]  there's nothing to fear.
[3258.86 --> 3260.50]  Now, as we rehearse this story,
[3261.12 --> 3262.86]  I want to get at that
[3262.86 --> 3266.20]  in a way different
[3266.20 --> 3267.76]  than I have ever done before
[3267.76 --> 3269.54]  in Easter Reflections,
[3270.02 --> 3272.04]  because I want to look
[3272.04 --> 3274.58]  at the women in this story.
[3275.68 --> 3276.92]  It's the third day
[3276.92 --> 3279.66]  since Jesus has been crucified.
[3279.66 --> 3280.66]  It's Sunday,
[3280.84 --> 3282.12]  the day after the Sabbath,
[3282.40 --> 3283.74]  and we read that
[3283.74 --> 3285.86]  at dawn of the first day of the week,
[3286.14 --> 3288.00]  Mary Magdalene and the other Mary
[3288.00 --> 3289.52]  went to look at the tomb.
[3290.96 --> 3292.16]  Now, what I want us to see
[3292.16 --> 3294.42]  is to notice the presence
[3294.42 --> 3297.04]  and the role of these women
[3297.04 --> 3298.60]  in the story.
[3299.38 --> 3299.60]  Right?
[3299.66 --> 3301.60]  At dawn on the first day of the week,
[3301.72 --> 3304.06]  the first thing these two do
[3304.06 --> 3306.66]  is go to Jesus.
[3307.38 --> 3309.20]  But it's not just this day.
[3309.20 --> 3311.52]  It's not just Resurrection Sunday
[3311.52 --> 3313.20]  that they did not yet know
[3313.20 --> 3313.84]  was coming.
[3314.28 --> 3314.42]  Right?
[3314.46 --> 3315.84]  It's been all along.
[3316.38 --> 3317.64]  If you have your Bible open,
[3317.70 --> 3318.26]  you can see it.
[3318.30 --> 3319.74]  Look back on Good Friday,
[3320.66 --> 3321.98]  the death of Jesus.
[3322.82 --> 3325.08]  In chapter 27, verse 55,
[3325.46 --> 3325.96]  we read,
[3325.96 --> 3344.34]  The male disciples in this story
[3344.34 --> 3346.34]  are nowhere to be found.
[3346.34 --> 3347.34]  Right?
[3349.30 --> 3350.34]  In the story of Jesus' death,
[3350.38 --> 3351.20]  we looked at on Friday,
[3351.34 --> 3353.10]  it takes a Roman centurion
[3353.10 --> 3355.06]  to announce what these women
[3355.06 --> 3356.06]  have seen all along.
[3357.34 --> 3358.90]  In the story that follows
[3358.90 --> 3359.96]  after the death of Jesus,
[3360.10 --> 3361.80]  the story that my Bible anyway
[3361.80 --> 3363.48]  titles The Burial of Jesus,
[3364.34 --> 3365.52]  in verse 57,
[3366.52 --> 3368.40]  you have Joseph of Arimathea
[3368.40 --> 3371.12]  who asks Pilate for Jesus' body
[3371.12 --> 3372.20]  that he may take him.
[3372.20 --> 3374.40]  Pilate says yes,
[3374.60 --> 3375.74]  and then Jesus' body
[3375.74 --> 3377.10]  is placed in a tomb
[3377.10 --> 3379.24]  with a circular stone in front.
[3379.34 --> 3380.54]  I have a picture of that,
[3380.60 --> 3380.96]  I think.
[3382.22 --> 3383.16]  This is a picture
[3383.16 --> 3385.58]  from when I was visiting Israel,
[3385.58 --> 3387.12]  and these tombs are dotted
[3387.12 --> 3388.16]  throughout the land.
[3388.22 --> 3390.26]  This is what it would have looked like
[3390.26 --> 3391.54]  for Joseph's tomb
[3391.54 --> 3393.20]  in that area,
[3393.28 --> 3394.20]  although where it is now
[3394.20 --> 3396.26]  is the metropolis of Jerusalem.
[3396.88 --> 3398.24]  This is outside of Jerusalem.
[3398.24 --> 3401.56]  And so the women go to the tomb,
[3401.64 --> 3403.06]  and we're told in verse 61,
[3404.02 --> 3406.66]  Mary Magdalene and the other Mary
[3406.66 --> 3409.76]  were sitting there opposite the tomb.
[3411.04 --> 3413.94]  The only two disciples left
[3413.94 --> 3416.16]  are these women.
[3418.24 --> 3419.92]  And as I was preparing for Sunday,
[3421.48 --> 3422.50]  I just want to say,
[3422.66 --> 3424.34]  can we praise God
[3424.34 --> 3425.82]  for faithful women?
[3425.82 --> 3428.38]  It's the testimony
[3428.38 --> 3429.82]  of faithful women
[3429.82 --> 3430.82]  who serve
[3431.34 --> 3432.56]  after everyone else
[3432.56 --> 3433.14]  has run away.
[3434.60 --> 3435.98]  It's faithful mothers
[3435.98 --> 3436.92]  and aunts
[3436.92 --> 3437.70]  and friends
[3437.70 --> 3439.16]  who persevere
[3439.16 --> 3439.88]  day in
[3439.88 --> 3441.02]  and day out,
[3441.40 --> 3441.82]  laboring
[3441.82 --> 3443.30]  in often unsung
[3443.30 --> 3444.70]  and unlauded ways,
[3444.78 --> 3446.00]  and it's their faithfulness,
[3446.84 --> 3448.98]  and because of their faithfulness,
[3449.08 --> 3449.72]  these women
[3449.72 --> 3450.88]  are called upon
[3450.88 --> 3451.66]  by our Lord
[3451.66 --> 3452.96]  to be heralds
[3452.96 --> 3453.96]  of his coming back
[3453.96 --> 3454.46]  from death.
[3454.46 --> 3456.18]  Their perseverance
[3456.18 --> 3457.14]  is rewarded
[3457.14 --> 3458.16]  by being the first
[3458.16 --> 3459.44]  to see Jesus.
[3459.94 --> 3460.64]  And so they hear
[3460.64 --> 3461.68]  the lovely words,
[3462.08 --> 3462.42]  greetings.
[3464.02 --> 3464.74]  Can you imagine
[3464.74 --> 3465.98]  hearing those words?
[3466.12 --> 3466.50]  Greetings.
[3466.78 --> 3468.76]  Imagine hearing that voice.
[3469.16 --> 3469.50]  Greetings.
[3469.82 --> 3471.40]  Imagine seeing his feet
[3471.40 --> 3473.02]  and clasping them,
[3473.44 --> 3474.50]  seeing his face
[3474.50 --> 3476.08]  and taking it in your hands.
[3476.20 --> 3476.72]  Greetings,
[3476.94 --> 3477.34]  he says.
[3477.58 --> 3478.94]  Do not be afraid.
[3479.62 --> 3482.10]  Go and tell my brothers.
[3482.10 --> 3485.10]  These women disciples
[3485.10 --> 3486.68]  who serve Jesus
[3486.68 --> 3489.24]  are worth emulating.
[3489.94 --> 3491.00]  They're worth celebrating.
[3491.66 --> 3492.86]  And Matthew
[3492.86 --> 3494.66]  is at pains
[3494.66 --> 3495.24]  in the way
[3495.24 --> 3496.48]  he writes this story
[3496.48 --> 3498.22]  to show their inclusion,
[3498.38 --> 3499.22]  to highlight it,
[3499.28 --> 3500.46]  and the pride of place
[3500.46 --> 3501.34]  that they have
[3501.34 --> 3501.90]  in the story.
[3502.64 --> 3503.42]  And I don't want you
[3503.42 --> 3503.88]  to miss it.
[3503.92 --> 3504.74]  I need you to hear it
[3504.74 --> 3505.52]  and to note it
[3505.52 --> 3506.78]  and to recognize
[3506.78 --> 3507.88]  that we can emulate
[3507.88 --> 3510.04]  these faithful women.
[3510.04 --> 3515.16]  But in that,
[3516.36 --> 3517.54]  there's also
[3517.54 --> 3520.72]  a not-so-implicit
[3520.72 --> 3522.02]  deprecation
[3522.02 --> 3523.16]  going on
[3523.16 --> 3524.02]  by Matthew
[3524.02 --> 3525.82]  as he's constantly
[3525.82 --> 3526.90]  drawing the eyes
[3526.90 --> 3527.60]  of his readers
[3527.60 --> 3529.26]  to see these women
[3529.26 --> 3529.88]  present
[3529.88 --> 3531.62]  and not the other disciples.
[3533.04 --> 3534.58]  There's a criticism here
[3534.58 --> 3536.12]  of the male disciples
[3536.12 --> 3537.18]  and their failed
[3537.18 --> 3538.24]  devotion.
[3538.24 --> 3540.44]  Let me ask you,
[3540.50 --> 3541.18]  where is Peter?
[3542.44 --> 3542.92]  Peter,
[3543.12 --> 3543.96]  who once said,
[3544.34 --> 3545.34]  you are the Christ,
[3545.52 --> 3546.94]  the Son of the living God.
[3547.36 --> 3547.62]  Peter,
[3547.74 --> 3548.12]  who said,
[3548.24 --> 3549.28]  you have the words
[3549.28 --> 3550.24]  of eternal life.
[3550.66 --> 3550.88]  Peter,
[3551.02 --> 3552.48]  to whom Jesus said,
[3552.84 --> 3553.62]  on this rock
[3553.62 --> 3554.76]  I will build my church
[3554.76 --> 3555.78]  and the gates of hell
[3555.78 --> 3557.18]  will not prevail over it.
[3557.34 --> 3558.14]  Where is he now?
[3560.64 --> 3561.08]  What we know
[3561.08 --> 3561.94]  from Peter's story
[3561.94 --> 3562.82]  is that he denied
[3562.82 --> 3563.88]  Jesus three times
[3563.88 --> 3564.60]  and he left him
[3564.60 --> 3565.52]  in his time of need.
[3565.52 --> 3568.52]  Where are James and John,
[3568.86 --> 3569.90]  the sons of Zebedee,
[3570.64 --> 3571.50]  who told Jesus
[3571.50 --> 3572.54]  that they could
[3572.54 --> 3573.28]  and they should
[3573.28 --> 3574.34]  sit at his right
[3574.34 --> 3575.16]  and left hand
[3575.16 --> 3576.28]  when he comes into glory,
[3576.48 --> 3577.34]  who confidently
[3577.34 --> 3578.12]  told Jesus
[3578.12 --> 3579.10]  that they could,
[3579.26 --> 3579.48]  in fact,
[3579.56 --> 3580.26]  drink the cup
[3580.26 --> 3581.36]  that was reserved to him,
[3581.40 --> 3581.86]  that they could,
[3582.02 --> 3582.20]  in fact,
[3582.26 --> 3582.80]  be baptized
[3582.80 --> 3583.90]  with the baptism
[3583.90 --> 3584.74]  of God's wrath
[3584.74 --> 3585.40]  that was going to
[3585.40 --> 3586.14]  pour out on him.
[3586.30 --> 3587.06]  They confidently
[3587.06 --> 3587.88]  stood in front of him
[3587.88 --> 3588.12]  and said,
[3588.20 --> 3588.42]  yes,
[3588.52 --> 3589.12]  we can.
[3590.12 --> 3591.34]  They stood with Peter
[3591.34 --> 3591.94]  on the mountain
[3591.94 --> 3593.06]  of the transfiguration
[3593.06 --> 3593.90]  and they heard
[3593.90 --> 3594.90]  God's voice say,
[3595.26 --> 3596.80]  this is my son
[3596.80 --> 3598.02]  whom I love
[3598.02 --> 3598.52]  with him.
[3598.60 --> 3599.58]  I am well pleased.
[3599.74 --> 3600.56]  Listen to him.
[3601.32 --> 3602.14]  They saw Moses
[3602.14 --> 3602.76]  and Elijah
[3602.76 --> 3604.44]  appear beside Jesus,
[3604.62 --> 3605.82]  but where are they now?
[3607.56 --> 3608.50]  They're not here.
[3609.92 --> 3610.74]  You know who is?
[3611.54 --> 3612.38]  Their mom.
[3614.30 --> 3614.98]  There's something
[3614.98 --> 3615.62]  going on there.
[3616.76 --> 3617.84]  Maybe they're hiding.
[3618.74 --> 3619.80]  They're probably scared.
[3621.16 --> 3621.34]  You know,
[3621.34 --> 3622.24]  as I was preparing
[3622.24 --> 3622.92]  for today,
[3623.70 --> 3624.76]  I wonder,
[3625.30 --> 3626.54]  and it struck me,
[3627.46 --> 3628.86]  I wonder if part
[3628.86 --> 3630.50]  of what we're seeing here,
[3630.58 --> 3631.54]  part of what Matthew
[3631.54 --> 3633.36]  is drawing our eyes to
[3633.36 --> 3636.30]  is that in this moment,
[3636.64 --> 3638.60]  the defeat of the curse
[3638.60 --> 3639.76]  that was first spoken
[3639.76 --> 3641.16]  in the Garden of Eden
[3641.16 --> 3642.88]  is being undone
[3642.88 --> 3644.56]  by this new telling
[3644.56 --> 3645.26]  of the story.
[3646.18 --> 3646.38]  Right?
[3646.44 --> 3647.76]  In the Garden of Eden,
[3648.18 --> 3649.84]  Eve ate from the fruit
[3649.84 --> 3650.44]  given to her
[3650.44 --> 3651.12]  by the serpent
[3651.12 --> 3651.92]  and then she gave it
[3651.92 --> 3652.32]  to Adam
[3652.32 --> 3653.86]  and then they both hid
[3653.86 --> 3654.88]  when God came
[3654.88 --> 3655.98]  walking through the garden
[3655.98 --> 3656.84]  looking for them.
[3656.92 --> 3658.14]  They hid in their shame
[3658.14 --> 3658.92]  and they fled.
[3660.04 --> 3660.90]  But now,
[3661.60 --> 3662.86]  Eve's offspring,
[3663.64 --> 3663.96]  Jesus,
[3664.22 --> 3664.84]  has crushed
[3664.84 --> 3666.06]  the head of the serpent.
[3667.08 --> 3667.94]  Sin and death
[3667.94 --> 3668.64]  have been defeated
[3668.64 --> 3669.38]  by the true
[3669.38 --> 3670.44]  and better Adam
[3670.44 --> 3671.58]  and these women
[3671.58 --> 3672.94]  refuse to hide.
[3674.28 --> 3674.44]  Right?
[3674.48 --> 3675.72]  Where the sons of Adam
[3675.72 --> 3676.84]  failed and hid
[3676.84 --> 3678.20]  because of the true
[3678.20 --> 3678.88]  and better Adam,
[3679.02 --> 3680.86]  these daughters of Eve
[3680.86 --> 3682.68]  will not hide.
[3682.92 --> 3683.58]  Not again.
[3683.92 --> 3684.84]  Not this time.
[3686.10 --> 3687.22]  Their faithfulness
[3687.22 --> 3688.30]  and their devotion,
[3688.78 --> 3689.60]  their commitment,
[3690.08 --> 3690.28]  right,
[3690.34 --> 3691.70]  is something for us
[3691.70 --> 3692.36]  to emulate
[3692.36 --> 3693.92]  but at the same time
[3693.92 --> 3696.00]  it is heaping
[3696.00 --> 3696.80]  burning coals
[3696.80 --> 3697.42]  of conviction
[3697.42 --> 3698.24]  on the heads
[3698.24 --> 3699.38]  of the male disciples.
[3699.38 --> 3704.78]  And I don't want
[3704.78 --> 3705.74]  to overstate this
[3705.74 --> 3706.22]  and I'm not going
[3706.22 --> 3706.66]  to live here
[3706.66 --> 3707.40]  for too long
[3707.40 --> 3708.98]  but for us
[3708.98 --> 3710.36]  men here today,
[3711.04 --> 3712.48]  I can't help
[3712.48 --> 3712.86]  but wonder
[3712.86 --> 3713.60]  if maybe we need
[3713.60 --> 3714.20]  to hear this.
[3717.14 --> 3717.54]  Right?
[3717.58 --> 3718.00]  I'm not going to,
[3718.18 --> 3718.64]  like I said,
[3718.66 --> 3719.12]  I'm not going to beat
[3719.12 --> 3719.62]  this point
[3719.62 --> 3720.96]  but statistically,
[3721.90 --> 3722.32]  churches,
[3722.80 --> 3724.18]  especially volunteer churches
[3724.18 --> 3724.90]  like ours,
[3725.20 --> 3726.56]  run on the backs
[3726.56 --> 3727.82]  of the often quiet,
[3728.20 --> 3728.52]  faithful,
[3728.52 --> 3729.40]  devoted,
[3729.68 --> 3730.40]  committed work
[3730.40 --> 3731.46]  of women.
[3733.38 --> 3733.94]  Statistically,
[3734.22 --> 3735.32]  in most homes,
[3735.74 --> 3737.32]  it is the woman
[3737.32 --> 3738.42]  who does
[3738.42 --> 3739.34]  faith formation.
[3740.80 --> 3740.94]  Right?
[3740.94 --> 3741.60]  Even in churches
[3741.60 --> 3742.46]  with predominantly
[3742.46 --> 3743.50]  male leadership,
[3744.10 --> 3745.50]  the hardest demographic
[3745.50 --> 3746.44]  to get involved
[3746.44 --> 3747.40]  and to get connected
[3747.40 --> 3748.38]  is men
[3748.38 --> 3749.38]  between the ages
[3749.38 --> 3750.32]  of 30 and 60.
[3752.04 --> 3752.28]  Now,
[3752.68 --> 3753.82]  don't hear what
[3753.82 --> 3754.32]  I'm not saying.
[3754.90 --> 3755.82]  I praise God
[3755.82 --> 3756.86]  for the reality
[3756.86 --> 3757.88]  that those statistics
[3757.88 --> 3758.88]  don't bear themselves
[3758.88 --> 3760.12]  out in our congregation
[3760.12 --> 3760.98]  in the same way
[3760.98 --> 3761.46]  as they do
[3761.46 --> 3762.08]  in other places.
[3764.60 --> 3765.32]  And yet,
[3765.88 --> 3767.42]  don't just dismiss
[3767.42 --> 3768.16]  what I said either.
[3769.30 --> 3769.70]  Now,
[3769.70 --> 3770.04]  I know there's
[3770.04 --> 3770.86]  all sorts of reasons,
[3771.20 --> 3771.74]  there's all sorts
[3771.74 --> 3772.38]  of expectations,
[3772.76 --> 3773.34]  there's all sorts
[3773.34 --> 3773.96]  of excuses,
[3774.88 --> 3776.18]  but I just wonder
[3776.18 --> 3776.98]  if maybe
[3776.98 --> 3778.88]  as we are rehearsing
[3778.88 --> 3779.70]  this story,
[3780.28 --> 3781.88]  if as men
[3781.88 --> 3783.58]  in the church
[3783.58 --> 3784.56]  and in this church,
[3784.56 --> 3785.44]  the reason
[3785.44 --> 3786.34]  for Matthew's
[3786.34 --> 3787.16]  pointing that out,
[3787.26 --> 3787.90]  we might still
[3787.90 --> 3788.70]  need to hear today.
[3789.82 --> 3790.50]  But I'll just
[3790.50 --> 3791.14]  leave that with you
[3791.14 --> 3792.48]  to ruminate on
[3792.48 --> 3793.60]  for a moment.
[3795.08 --> 3796.34]  I also think
[3796.34 --> 3797.50]  there's another reason
[3797.50 --> 3798.42]  why Matthew
[3798.42 --> 3800.12]  labors to mention
[3800.12 --> 3801.90]  all the women
[3801.90 --> 3802.78]  who are present
[3802.78 --> 3804.56]  and that it is
[3804.56 --> 3805.32]  two women
[3805.32 --> 3806.14]  to whom
[3806.14 --> 3807.24]  Jesus first appears.
[3808.20 --> 3809.02]  And this is where
[3809.02 --> 3809.34]  we'll spend
[3809.34 --> 3810.04]  the rest of our time.
[3810.84 --> 3811.76]  I think Matthew
[3811.76 --> 3812.52]  is at pains
[3812.52 --> 3813.68]  to make this point
[3813.68 --> 3815.16]  because that's
[3815.16 --> 3816.46]  what actually happened.
[3818.30 --> 3819.78]  Quite matter-of-factly,
[3820.16 --> 3821.46]  Matthew is concerned
[3821.46 --> 3822.84]  with writing history.
[3823.88 --> 3824.38]  Now,
[3824.44 --> 3824.94]  it's history
[3824.94 --> 3826.52]  with a theological focus,
[3826.64 --> 3827.10]  absolutely,
[3827.40 --> 3828.46]  but it's still history.
[3829.64 --> 3830.72]  And one of the amazing
[3830.72 --> 3832.00]  things about Christianity
[3832.00 --> 3835.36]  is our historical rootedness.
[3835.48 --> 3837.18]  It is the groundedness
[3837.18 --> 3838.16]  of our faith
[3838.16 --> 3840.22]  in a story,
[3840.40 --> 3841.50]  in history.
[3841.50 --> 3842.88]  what we call
[3842.88 --> 3843.32]  the Bible.
[3844.48 --> 3844.62]  So,
[3844.70 --> 3845.52]  just quickly,
[3845.68 --> 3846.08]  to date,
[3846.76 --> 3847.70]  there has been
[3847.70 --> 3848.76]  zero
[3848.76 --> 3850.50]  archaeological findings
[3850.50 --> 3851.70]  that contradict
[3851.70 --> 3852.62]  what the Bible
[3852.62 --> 3853.18]  declares
[3853.18 --> 3853.78]  has happened.
[3855.02 --> 3855.20]  Now,
[3855.22 --> 3855.52]  there's been
[3855.52 --> 3856.66]  periods of time
[3856.66 --> 3857.38]  where there
[3857.38 --> 3858.96]  seems to be
[3858.96 --> 3859.60]  an absence
[3859.60 --> 3860.84]  of evidence,
[3861.00 --> 3861.82]  but the absence
[3861.82 --> 3862.30]  of evidence
[3862.30 --> 3863.10]  is not the evidence
[3863.10 --> 3863.56]  of absence.
[3864.04 --> 3865.38]  There seems to be
[3865.38 --> 3866.94]  some missing
[3866.94 --> 3867.94]  stories,
[3868.22 --> 3868.62]  and yet,
[3868.72 --> 3869.38]  over time,
[3869.50 --> 3869.92]  those things
[3869.92 --> 3870.44]  are found.
[3871.50 --> 3872.62]  Even when there's
[3872.62 --> 3874.16]  confusion about something,
[3874.42 --> 3875.16]  and there doesn't seem
[3875.16 --> 3875.86]  to be archaeological
[3875.86 --> 3877.18]  evidence to support it,
[3877.44 --> 3878.68]  more often than not,
[3879.02 --> 3879.60]  it's found.
[3880.60 --> 3881.30]  This has happened
[3881.30 --> 3882.66]  over and over and over,
[3882.78 --> 3883.86]  especially in the last
[3883.86 --> 3884.96]  300 years
[3884.96 --> 3885.84]  as the science
[3885.84 --> 3886.60]  of archaeology
[3886.60 --> 3887.20]  has become
[3887.20 --> 3888.20]  more and more
[3888.20 --> 3888.92]  predominant.
[3889.92 --> 3890.90]  Point is,
[3891.74 --> 3892.46]  Matthew
[3892.46 --> 3895.34]  tells this story
[3895.34 --> 3897.52]  in this way
[3897.52 --> 3899.30]  because this is
[3899.30 --> 3900.32]  how it actually
[3900.32 --> 3900.82]  happened.
[3901.38 --> 3902.36]  And he's more
[3902.36 --> 3903.08]  concerned
[3903.08 --> 3904.38]  with the truth
[3904.38 --> 3905.48]  of the event
[3905.48 --> 3906.46]  than with
[3906.46 --> 3907.52]  himself looking
[3907.52 --> 3908.52]  good or with
[3908.52 --> 3909.12]  him making
[3909.12 --> 3909.66]  the other
[3909.66 --> 3910.20]  disciples
[3910.20 --> 3911.48]  look good.
[3912.64 --> 3913.58]  And that's
[3913.58 --> 3914.52]  really important
[3914.52 --> 3915.50]  for us to hear.
[3916.28 --> 3917.36]  Because sometimes
[3917.36 --> 3917.76]  people,
[3917.88 --> 3918.64]  very intelligent
[3918.64 --> 3920.48]  and otherwise
[3920.48 --> 3921.30]  well-meaning
[3921.30 --> 3921.78]  people,
[3921.78 --> 3923.90]  when wanting
[3923.90 --> 3925.00]  to disprove
[3925.00 --> 3925.90]  Christianity,
[3926.54 --> 3927.56]  say something
[3927.56 --> 3928.24]  like,
[3928.58 --> 3929.38]  the gospel
[3929.38 --> 3930.72]  writers wrote
[3930.72 --> 3931.34]  the things
[3931.34 --> 3932.00]  that they did
[3932.00 --> 3932.60]  in the ways
[3932.60 --> 3933.24]  that they did
[3933.24 --> 3934.62]  to bolster
[3934.62 --> 3935.44]  their position
[3935.44 --> 3936.28]  in society.
[3937.10 --> 3937.22]  Right?
[3937.22 --> 3938.56]  They made up
[3938.56 --> 3939.58]  stories to
[3939.58 --> 3940.40]  undergird
[3940.40 --> 3941.18]  their social
[3941.18 --> 3941.74]  power.
[3943.96 --> 3944.20]  Right?
[3944.26 --> 3944.84]  That the early
[3944.84 --> 3945.62]  church was
[3945.62 --> 3947.30]  garnering influence
[3947.30 --> 3948.20]  in society
[3948.20 --> 3948.76]  and so
[3948.76 --> 3949.62]  what they did
[3949.62 --> 3950.54]  is they created
[3950.54 --> 3951.38]  these myths
[3951.38 --> 3952.22]  to support
[3952.22 --> 3953.42]  their new
[3953.42 --> 3954.08]  reality.
[3955.36 --> 3955.82]  In short,
[3955.94 --> 3956.34]  the argument
[3956.34 --> 3956.62]  goes,
[3956.84 --> 3957.50]  they made up
[3957.50 --> 3958.26]  stories of
[3958.26 --> 3959.08]  great power
[3959.08 --> 3960.06]  and of people
[3960.06 --> 3960.66]  with great
[3960.66 --> 3961.38]  power and
[3961.38 --> 3962.02]  influence
[3962.02 --> 3962.94]  of resurrection
[3962.94 --> 3964.24]  in order to
[3964.24 --> 3964.86]  keep their
[3964.86 --> 3965.68]  social capital,
[3966.02 --> 3966.46]  in order to
[3966.46 --> 3966.90]  keep their
[3966.90 --> 3967.54]  influence.
[3969.28 --> 3969.44]  And
[3969.44 --> 3971.38]  charitably,
[3971.54 --> 3971.68]  right,
[3971.74 --> 3972.78]  to be fair,
[3973.26 --> 3974.20]  by the
[3974.20 --> 3975.10]  analogy of
[3975.10 --> 3975.98]  human experience,
[3976.20 --> 3976.86]  this is a
[3976.86 --> 3977.82]  reasonable argument.
[3979.04 --> 3979.54]  People do
[3979.54 --> 3979.94]  this.
[3980.48 --> 3980.96]  We've seen
[3980.96 --> 3981.48]  people do
[3981.48 --> 3982.52]  this regularly
[3982.52 --> 3983.16]  throughout
[3983.16 --> 3983.64]  history.
[3985.40 --> 3986.08]  However,
[3986.76 --> 3988.40]  I don't
[3988.40 --> 3988.86]  think that's
[3988.86 --> 3989.48]  the case
[3989.48 --> 3990.74]  in this
[3990.74 --> 3991.74]  story.
[3992.00 --> 3992.28]  I don't
[3992.28 --> 3992.60]  think that's
[3992.60 --> 3993.12]  the case
[3993.12 --> 3994.18]  in this
[3994.18 --> 3994.58]  account.
[3994.72 --> 3995.20]  And for
[3995.20 --> 3995.64]  at least
[3995.64 --> 3996.40]  two reasons,
[3996.50 --> 3996.76]  there are
[3996.76 --> 3996.98]  more,
[3997.06 --> 3997.28]  but I'll
[3997.28 --> 3997.84]  focus on
[3997.84 --> 3998.18]  two this
[3998.18 --> 3998.40]  morning.
[3999.62 --> 4000.18]  First,
[4001.46 --> 4002.86]  the Gospels
[4002.86 --> 4003.82]  were written
[4003.82 --> 4005.44]  probably sometime
[4005.44 --> 4006.24]  between
[4006.24 --> 4006.80]  A.D.
[4006.90 --> 4007.58]  60 and
[4007.58 --> 4008.06]  A.D.
[4008.06 --> 4008.66]  80,
[4008.86 --> 4009.36]  in the case
[4009.36 --> 4009.84]  of Matthew,
[4010.10 --> 4010.30]  Mark,
[4010.42 --> 4011.10]  and Luke,
[4011.48 --> 4012.40]  and John
[4012.40 --> 4012.90]  sometime
[4012.90 --> 4013.98]  probably between
[4013.98 --> 4014.26]  A.D.
[4014.34 --> 4015.06]  90 and
[4015.06 --> 4015.44]  100.
[4016.36 --> 4016.86]  And to be
[4016.86 --> 4017.18]  clear,
[4018.02 --> 4019.42]  this is long
[4019.42 --> 4020.96]  before Christians
[4020.96 --> 4021.76]  or Christian
[4021.76 --> 4022.72]  groups have
[4022.72 --> 4024.82]  any social
[4024.82 --> 4026.16]  influence or
[4026.16 --> 4027.46]  any power.
[4028.50 --> 4029.38]  This is when
[4029.38 --> 4029.90]  they're still
[4029.90 --> 4030.76]  being killed
[4030.76 --> 4031.94]  just for the
[4031.94 --> 4033.20]  name Christian.
[4035.06 --> 4035.98]  The telling
[4035.98 --> 4036.42]  of these
[4036.42 --> 4037.24]  stories doesn't
[4037.24 --> 4037.94]  protect their
[4037.94 --> 4038.44]  power.
[4038.86 --> 4039.26]  The telling
[4039.26 --> 4039.64]  of these
[4039.64 --> 4040.84]  stories actually
[4040.84 --> 4041.44]  brings them
[4041.44 --> 4042.34]  into direct
[4042.34 --> 4043.08]  and deadly
[4043.08 --> 4044.28]  conflict with
[4044.28 --> 4044.90]  the power of
[4044.90 --> 4045.24]  the day,
[4045.32 --> 4045.62]  with the
[4045.62 --> 4046.20]  Roman Empire.
[4046.20 --> 4046.28]  power.
[4048.36 --> 4049.22]  The second
[4049.22 --> 4050.24]  problem with
[4050.24 --> 4051.32]  this argument
[4051.32 --> 4052.76]  is that if
[4052.76 --> 4053.68]  you are writing
[4053.68 --> 4054.96]  these stories
[4054.96 --> 4055.62]  to gain
[4055.62 --> 4056.42]  influence or
[4056.42 --> 4056.80]  to keep
[4056.80 --> 4057.70]  any power,
[4058.54 --> 4059.42]  you would
[4059.42 --> 4060.28]  probably make
[4060.28 --> 4060.70]  your main
[4060.70 --> 4062.26]  characters come
[4062.26 --> 4062.74]  out better
[4062.74 --> 4063.68]  than they do.
[4064.60 --> 4065.04]  If you're
[4065.04 --> 4065.44]  trying to
[4065.44 --> 4066.06]  fabricate a
[4066.06 --> 4066.98]  story about
[4066.98 --> 4067.54]  a rabbi
[4067.54 --> 4067.96]  who was
[4067.96 --> 4068.56]  resurrected,
[4068.88 --> 4069.34]  for instance,
[4069.46 --> 4070.06]  you simply
[4070.06 --> 4070.74]  wouldn't use
[4070.74 --> 4071.50]  women as
[4071.50 --> 4072.84]  the eyewitnesses.
[4073.80 --> 4074.32]  In both
[4074.32 --> 4075.22]  Jewish and
[4075.22 --> 4076.14]  Roman legal
[4076.14 --> 4076.80]  traditions,
[4077.30 --> 4078.14]  a testimony
[4078.14 --> 4079.00]  is only
[4079.00 --> 4079.74]  valid if
[4079.74 --> 4080.26]  it's brought
[4080.26 --> 4080.98]  forward by
[4080.98 --> 4082.22]  two people,
[4082.38 --> 4082.78]  by two
[4082.78 --> 4083.62]  eyewitnesses.
[4083.82 --> 4084.12]  Now Matthew
[4084.12 --> 4084.54]  got that
[4084.54 --> 4085.02]  part right,
[4085.86 --> 4087.68]  but in
[4087.68 --> 4088.02]  the law
[4088.02 --> 4088.36]  court,
[4089.14 --> 4090.28]  women don't
[4090.28 --> 4091.00]  count.
[4092.00 --> 4092.46]  They can't
[4092.46 --> 4092.96]  be witnesses.
[4093.44 --> 4093.92]  They aren't
[4093.92 --> 4094.48]  reliable,
[4094.84 --> 4095.54]  so we are
[4095.54 --> 4095.80]  told.
[4096.50 --> 4097.02]  It's not my
[4097.02 --> 4097.30]  words,
[4097.80 --> 4098.32]  it's their
[4098.32 --> 4098.58]  words.
[4100.00 --> 4100.38]  In fact,
[4100.66 --> 4101.70]  non-Jewish
[4101.70 --> 4103.04]  slaves who
[4103.04 --> 4103.70]  are men
[4103.70 --> 4104.92]  ranked higher
[4104.92 --> 4105.72]  in the law
[4105.72 --> 4106.68]  court than
[4106.68 --> 4107.14]  any women
[4107.14 --> 4107.38]  did.
[4108.86 --> 4109.34]  And if
[4109.34 --> 4110.24]  Matthew is
[4110.24 --> 4110.90]  making up
[4110.90 --> 4111.74]  this story,
[4111.96 --> 4112.64]  it would be
[4112.64 --> 4114.00]  ludicrous for
[4114.00 --> 4114.72]  him to name
[4114.72 --> 4115.80]  a woman as
[4115.80 --> 4116.16]  a first
[4116.16 --> 4116.74]  eyewitness,
[4117.70 --> 4119.78]  unless Matthew
[4119.78 --> 4120.54]  is concerned
[4120.54 --> 4121.04]  with getting
[4121.04 --> 4121.84]  it right,
[4122.86 --> 4124.00]  unless Matthew's
[4124.00 --> 4125.16]  priority is
[4125.16 --> 4126.80]  telling history.
[4126.80 --> 4134.64]  women are
[4134.64 --> 4135.20]  the first
[4135.20 --> 4136.86]  eyewitnesses,
[4137.14 --> 4138.54]  precisely because
[4138.54 --> 4139.52]  such an idea
[4139.52 --> 4139.98]  would be
[4139.98 --> 4140.70]  incredulous
[4140.70 --> 4141.46]  unless it
[4141.46 --> 4142.00]  were true,
[4142.54 --> 4143.74]  actually makes
[4143.74 --> 4144.66]  their inclusion
[4144.66 --> 4145.86]  in the story
[4145.86 --> 4147.00]  an argument
[4147.00 --> 4148.32]  in favor of
[4148.32 --> 4149.06]  the resurrection
[4149.06 --> 4150.12]  actually
[4150.12 --> 4151.04]  happening.
[4151.04 --> 4154.44]  now,
[4154.80 --> 4156.30]  if you are
[4156.30 --> 4156.94]  skeptical,
[4157.66 --> 4157.88]  right,
[4158.40 --> 4159.26]  that's fair,
[4159.50 --> 4160.14]  this is a lot,
[4160.30 --> 4160.72]  I'll give you
[4160.72 --> 4160.96]  that,
[4161.96 --> 4162.68]  but at the
[4162.68 --> 4163.58]  very least,
[4163.72 --> 4164.28]  it seems to
[4164.28 --> 4164.48]  me,
[4165.26 --> 4165.94]  you have to
[4165.94 --> 4166.90]  concede that
[4166.90 --> 4167.80]  Mary and
[4167.80 --> 4168.22]  the other
[4168.22 --> 4168.60]  Mary,
[4169.04 --> 4169.52]  that eventually
[4169.52 --> 4170.20]  the rest of
[4170.20 --> 4170.76]  the disciples,
[4171.28 --> 4171.96]  eventually the
[4171.96 --> 4173.20]  other eyewitnesses,
[4173.36 --> 4174.18]  we can read in
[4174.18 --> 4175.04]  Paul that at
[4175.04 --> 4176.72]  one time there
[4176.72 --> 4177.12]  was up to
[4177.12 --> 4178.58]  500 eyewitnesses
[4178.58 --> 4179.22]  in a single
[4179.22 --> 4179.74]  encounter,
[4179.74 --> 4180.48]  all who saw
[4180.48 --> 4181.10]  the resurrected
[4181.10 --> 4181.62]  Jesus,
[4182.28 --> 4182.40]  right,
[4182.44 --> 4183.08]  that Paul,
[4183.44 --> 4184.26]  who had a
[4184.26 --> 4185.04]  vision of him
[4185.04 --> 4185.98]  on the Damascus
[4185.98 --> 4186.24]  road,
[4186.32 --> 4186.82]  you have to
[4186.82 --> 4187.52]  concede at
[4187.52 --> 4188.64]  the very least
[4188.64 --> 4189.60]  that they
[4189.60 --> 4190.60]  believed that
[4190.60 --> 4191.34]  they saw,
[4191.74 --> 4192.16]  talked,
[4192.34 --> 4193.16]  and ate with
[4193.16 --> 4193.84]  the resurrected
[4193.84 --> 4194.76]  Jesus.
[4196.48 --> 4197.04]  Right,
[4197.08 --> 4197.78]  as miraculous
[4197.78 --> 4199.14]  as this story
[4199.14 --> 4199.80]  is,
[4200.34 --> 4201.32]  on balance,
[4201.76 --> 4202.50]  these people
[4202.50 --> 4203.48]  really believed
[4203.48 --> 4204.02]  it's true.
[4205.26 --> 4205.94]  And that also
[4205.94 --> 4206.62]  means on
[4206.62 --> 4207.24]  balance,
[4207.44 --> 4208.42]  it is not
[4208.42 --> 4209.36]  irrational
[4209.36 --> 4210.32]  for you
[4210.32 --> 4211.02]  and I
[4211.02 --> 4211.92]  to also
[4211.92 --> 4212.84]  believe
[4212.84 --> 4213.48]  that it's
[4213.48 --> 4213.72]  true.
[4214.96 --> 4215.08]  Right,
[4215.14 --> 4215.82]  believing in
[4215.82 --> 4216.30]  the resurrection
[4216.30 --> 4217.04]  is the
[4217.04 --> 4217.94]  cogent and
[4217.94 --> 4218.42]  compelling
[4218.42 --> 4219.12]  conclusion
[4219.12 --> 4219.96]  of the
[4219.96 --> 4220.48]  gospels,
[4220.56 --> 4220.80]  of the
[4220.80 --> 4221.32]  claims of
[4221.32 --> 4221.64]  Jesus,
[4221.64 --> 4222.28]  of the
[4222.28 --> 4222.70]  revelation
[4222.70 --> 4223.00]  of the
[4223.00 --> 4223.30]  Bible.
[4224.78 --> 4225.06]  Right,
[4225.12 --> 4225.94]  our shared
[4225.94 --> 4226.70]  belief in
[4226.70 --> 4227.34]  the resurrection
[4227.34 --> 4228.60]  rests on
[4228.60 --> 4229.46]  history,
[4229.90 --> 4230.56]  it rests on
[4230.56 --> 4231.50]  evidence and
[4231.50 --> 4231.86]  reason,
[4232.00 --> 4232.48]  and it is
[4232.48 --> 4233.04]  logical.
[4234.48 --> 4235.50]  Our Christian
[4235.50 --> 4236.08]  beliefs,
[4236.62 --> 4237.60]  even of the
[4237.60 --> 4238.18]  resurrection,
[4238.56 --> 4239.84]  are warranted
[4239.84 --> 4240.74]  based on the
[4240.74 --> 4241.46]  evidence given.
[4242.14 --> 4242.74]  The resurrection
[4242.74 --> 4243.36]  is,
[4243.36 --> 4243.90]  first,
[4244.24 --> 4245.16]  a historical
[4245.16 --> 4245.96]  claim.
[4248.16 --> 4248.42]  Now,
[4249.42 --> 4251.10]  make sure you
[4251.10 --> 4251.64]  hear this next
[4251.64 --> 4251.88]  part.
[4253.16 --> 4253.96]  The resurrection
[4253.96 --> 4254.88]  is a historical
[4254.88 --> 4255.28]  claim,
[4256.28 --> 4257.84]  and yet,
[4258.20 --> 4259.16]  that the
[4259.16 --> 4259.68]  resurrection
[4259.68 --> 4261.52]  benefits me.
[4262.16 --> 4263.04]  That the
[4263.04 --> 4264.04]  resurrection is
[4264.04 --> 4264.76]  God's victory
[4264.76 --> 4265.56]  over sin
[4265.56 --> 4266.16]  and death.
[4266.54 --> 4268.12]  That is a
[4268.12 --> 4268.76]  theological
[4268.76 --> 4271.00]  claim about
[4271.00 --> 4271.62]  a historical
[4271.62 --> 4272.04]  event.
[4273.36 --> 4274.18]  And that's
[4274.18 --> 4274.56]  where I want
[4274.56 --> 4275.02]  to spend
[4275.02 --> 4275.92]  the rest of
[4275.92 --> 4276.30]  our time,
[4276.36 --> 4276.68]  where I will
[4276.68 --> 4277.36]  end this
[4277.36 --> 4277.62]  morning,
[4277.62 --> 4277.98]  with the
[4277.98 --> 4278.78]  theological
[4278.78 --> 4279.72]  implications
[4279.72 --> 4281.18]  for the
[4281.18 --> 4281.90]  historical
[4281.90 --> 4283.78]  event that
[4283.78 --> 4284.44]  actually took
[4284.44 --> 4284.94]  place,
[4285.12 --> 4285.90]  that is the
[4285.90 --> 4286.32]  resurrection
[4286.32 --> 4287.66]  of Jesus.
[4289.26 --> 4290.22]  After greeting
[4290.22 --> 4290.62]  them,
[4291.04 --> 4291.66]  Jesus said
[4291.66 --> 4292.06]  to the
[4292.06 --> 4292.28]  women,
[4292.28 --> 4293.36]  do not
[4293.36 --> 4294.74]  be afraid.
[4296.06 --> 4296.56]  This is the
[4296.56 --> 4297.42]  first theological
[4297.42 --> 4298.46]  claim for
[4298.46 --> 4299.02]  Resurrection
[4299.02 --> 4299.56]  Sunday.
[4300.50 --> 4301.20]  Since the
[4301.20 --> 4302.20]  resurrection is
[4302.20 --> 4302.54]  true,
[4302.72 --> 4303.42]  since God
[4303.42 --> 4304.00]  is not
[4304.00 --> 4304.38]  dead,
[4304.82 --> 4305.80]  we fear
[4305.80 --> 4306.92]  nothing.
[4308.42 --> 4309.02]  Nothing.
[4309.28 --> 4310.06]  Not even
[4310.06 --> 4311.14]  death itself
[4311.14 --> 4312.08]  has a sting
[4312.08 --> 4312.94]  anymore.
[4314.10 --> 4314.42]  And whether
[4314.42 --> 4314.78]  it's the
[4314.78 --> 4315.42]  threat of
[4315.42 --> 4316.30]  death and
[4316.30 --> 4316.84]  persecution,
[4317.14 --> 4317.46]  or the
[4317.46 --> 4318.22]  imminence of
[4318.22 --> 4319.02]  death because
[4319.02 --> 4319.98]  of disease or
[4319.98 --> 4320.64]  illness or
[4320.64 --> 4321.00]  age,
[4321.28 --> 4322.04]  the resurrection
[4322.04 --> 4323.74]  transforms your
[4323.74 --> 4324.30]  and my
[4324.30 --> 4325.66]  experience of
[4325.66 --> 4326.56]  death and
[4326.56 --> 4326.98]  dying.
[4328.20 --> 4329.56]  In the
[4329.56 --> 4329.88]  Bible,
[4330.28 --> 4330.82]  death is
[4330.82 --> 4331.92]  described as
[4331.92 --> 4332.70]  the last
[4332.70 --> 4333.52]  and great
[4333.52 --> 4334.30]  enemy,
[4334.60 --> 4335.38]  and if that
[4335.38 --> 4336.04]  enemy is
[4336.04 --> 4336.48]  defeated,
[4337.54 --> 4338.16]  what else in
[4338.16 --> 4338.72]  life do you
[4338.72 --> 4339.10]  need to be
[4339.10 --> 4339.68]  afraid of?
[4340.88 --> 4341.44]  On the
[4341.44 --> 4342.10]  cross and
[4342.10 --> 4342.64]  in the
[4342.64 --> 4343.14]  resurrection,
[4343.40 --> 4344.16]  Jesus crushed
[4344.16 --> 4344.88]  the head of
[4344.88 --> 4345.40]  the serpent,
[4345.72 --> 4346.22]  that great
[4346.22 --> 4346.88]  adversary,
[4347.14 --> 4347.68]  the Satan,
[4347.84 --> 4348.42]  the deceiver,
[4348.64 --> 4349.32]  and if he
[4349.32 --> 4349.98]  has been
[4349.98 --> 4350.62]  defeated,
[4350.98 --> 4351.58]  what is
[4351.58 --> 4352.16]  left for
[4352.16 --> 4352.60]  you to
[4352.60 --> 4353.08]  be afraid
[4353.08 --> 4353.38]  of?
[4355.64 --> 4356.06]  And remember,
[4356.14 --> 4356.56]  this is what we
[4356.56 --> 4357.28]  rehearse every
[4357.28 --> 4358.10]  single Sunday,
[4358.32 --> 4358.96]  so when I'm
[4358.96 --> 4359.70]  standing up here
[4359.70 --> 4360.18]  at the end of
[4360.18 --> 4360.86]  our services on
[4360.86 --> 4361.32]  Sunday and I
[4361.32 --> 4361.52]  say,
[4361.76 --> 4362.34]  do not be
[4362.34 --> 4362.82]  afraid,
[4363.82 --> 4364.44]  it's because
[4364.44 --> 4365.84]  of this.
[4367.20 --> 4367.86]  It's because
[4367.86 --> 4368.14]  of the
[4368.14 --> 4368.66]  resurrection.
[4370.40 --> 4371.10]  Right here is
[4371.10 --> 4371.38]  what the
[4371.38 --> 4372.06]  resurrection in
[4372.06 --> 4372.60]  the cross
[4372.60 --> 4373.44]  means for the
[4373.44 --> 4373.88]  Christian.
[4375.00 --> 4375.96]  The worst
[4375.96 --> 4376.92]  thing that
[4376.92 --> 4377.48]  could ever
[4377.48 --> 4378.12]  happen to
[4378.12 --> 4379.36]  us already
[4379.36 --> 4379.82]  has.
[4381.08 --> 4381.72]  Let me say
[4381.72 --> 4381.96]  that again,
[4382.02 --> 4382.46]  the worst
[4382.46 --> 4382.88]  thing that
[4382.88 --> 4383.80]  could ever
[4383.80 --> 4384.26]  happen to
[4384.26 --> 4385.06]  us already
[4385.06 --> 4385.86]  has because
[4385.86 --> 4387.10]  we died
[4387.10 --> 4387.78]  with Christ.
[4389.04 --> 4389.70]  And then
[4389.70 --> 4390.12]  also,
[4390.32 --> 4390.72]  the best
[4390.72 --> 4391.28]  thing that
[4391.28 --> 4391.76]  could ever
[4391.76 --> 4392.34]  happen to
[4392.34 --> 4393.84]  us already
[4393.84 --> 4395.76]  has because
[4395.76 --> 4396.62]  we have been
[4396.62 --> 4397.82]  raised with
[4397.82 --> 4398.44]  him.
[4400.34 --> 4401.22]  Paul says
[4401.22 --> 4402.04]  in Romans 6
[4402.04 --> 4402.52]  and in
[4402.52 --> 4403.18]  Colossians 2,
[4403.26 --> 4403.58]  he says,
[4403.98 --> 4404.82]  we died
[4404.82 --> 4405.82]  with Christ.
[4405.82 --> 4405.90]  Christ.
[4406.90 --> 4407.20]  And so
[4407.20 --> 4407.40]  in the
[4407.40 --> 4408.24]  great exchange
[4408.24 --> 4408.64]  of the
[4408.64 --> 4408.96]  gospel,
[4409.14 --> 4409.56]  we have
[4409.56 --> 4410.28]  died with
[4410.28 --> 4410.74]  Christ.
[4411.14 --> 4411.88]  The punishment
[4411.88 --> 4412.80]  that he paid
[4412.80 --> 4413.58]  that was on
[4413.58 --> 4414.42]  him for our
[4414.42 --> 4415.84]  sins is
[4415.84 --> 4417.58]  union with
[4417.58 --> 4418.30]  us in
[4418.30 --> 4420.90]  becoming sin
[4420.90 --> 4421.46]  for us.
[4421.58 --> 4422.34]  It means that
[4422.34 --> 4422.80]  the death
[4422.80 --> 4423.94]  that he died
[4423.94 --> 4424.74]  for us
[4424.74 --> 4425.88]  and in the
[4425.88 --> 4426.46]  death that
[4426.46 --> 4427.12]  he died,
[4427.36 --> 4428.16]  we died
[4428.16 --> 4429.92]  with him.
[4431.14 --> 4431.96]  This is the
[4431.96 --> 4432.74]  power of the
[4432.74 --> 4433.84]  cross and of
[4433.84 --> 4434.54]  the resurrection,
[4434.54 --> 4435.54]  of our
[4435.54 --> 4436.30]  union by
[4436.30 --> 4437.24]  grace through
[4437.24 --> 4438.36]  faith with
[4438.36 --> 4439.50]  Jesus Christ.
[4439.94 --> 4440.52]  Death no
[4440.52 --> 4441.34]  longer has
[4441.34 --> 4442.94]  mastery over
[4442.94 --> 4443.68]  you because
[4443.68 --> 4444.50]  of Christ.
[4445.54 --> 4446.26]  We've already
[4446.26 --> 4446.82]  died it.
[4447.54 --> 4448.14]  We've already
[4448.14 --> 4448.96]  died to it.
[4449.90 --> 4450.64]  Death holds
[4450.64 --> 4451.54]  no fear
[4451.54 --> 4452.66]  because for
[4452.66 --> 4453.40]  those of us
[4453.40 --> 4454.20]  who die,
[4454.34 --> 4454.88]  we go to
[4454.88 --> 4455.38]  be with
[4455.38 --> 4455.90]  Christ.
[4457.12 --> 4457.92]  The spiritual
[4457.92 --> 4458.70]  union we
[4458.70 --> 4459.36]  have with
[4459.36 --> 4460.42]  him becomes
[4460.42 --> 4461.12]  a material
[4461.12 --> 4461.64]  union.
[4462.48 --> 4462.78]  And so
[4462.78 --> 4463.14]  there's nothing
[4463.14 --> 4463.72]  to be afraid
[4463.72 --> 4464.02]  of.
[4465.16 --> 4465.98]  The worst
[4465.98 --> 4466.40]  thing that
[4466.40 --> 4466.72]  could ever
[4466.72 --> 4467.24]  happen to
[4467.24 --> 4467.92]  us already
[4467.92 --> 4468.40]  has.
[4469.34 --> 4469.58]  And so
[4469.58 --> 4469.88]  you don't
[4469.88 --> 4470.28]  need to be
[4470.28 --> 4470.84]  afraid of
[4470.84 --> 4471.70]  death or
[4471.70 --> 4472.56]  dying or
[4472.56 --> 4473.46]  anything else
[4473.46 --> 4474.08]  in all of
[4474.08 --> 4474.66]  creation
[4474.66 --> 4476.64]  because he's
[4476.64 --> 4477.02]  done it.
[4477.66 --> 4478.28]  That's the
[4478.28 --> 4478.94]  power of the
[4478.94 --> 4479.98]  cross because
[4479.98 --> 4480.46]  of the
[4480.46 --> 4480.96]  resurrection.
[4482.72 --> 4483.36]  But there's
[4483.36 --> 4483.70]  more.
[4484.52 --> 4485.20]  Paul goes on
[4485.20 --> 4485.82]  in Romans 6.
[4485.90 --> 4486.10]  He says,
[4486.10 --> 4486.74]  For we,
[4487.04 --> 4487.56]  if we have
[4487.56 --> 4488.20]  been united
[4488.20 --> 4488.74]  with him
[4488.74 --> 4489.28]  in a death
[4489.28 --> 4489.96]  like his,
[4490.08 --> 4490.52]  we will
[4490.52 --> 4491.34]  certainly also
[4491.34 --> 4492.02]  be united
[4492.02 --> 4492.70]  with him
[4492.70 --> 4492.98]  in a
[4492.98 --> 4493.32]  resurrection
[4493.32 --> 4494.12]  like his.
[4494.52 --> 4494.92]  Or he
[4494.92 --> 4495.34]  says in
[4495.34 --> 4495.92]  Colossians,
[4496.36 --> 4497.10]  Since then
[4497.10 --> 4497.96]  you have
[4497.96 --> 4498.46]  been,
[4498.50 --> 4499.10]  notice the
[4499.10 --> 4499.50]  tense of
[4499.50 --> 4499.68]  that,
[4499.78 --> 4500.28]  you have
[4500.28 --> 4501.52]  been raised
[4501.52 --> 4502.22]  with Christ.
[4502.90 --> 4503.30]  It's already
[4503.30 --> 4505.00]  happened in
[4505.00 --> 4505.58]  the spiritual
[4505.58 --> 4506.94]  truth of this.
[4507.06 --> 4507.52]  Set your
[4507.52 --> 4508.14]  hearts on
[4508.14 --> 4509.02]  things above
[4509.02 --> 4509.74]  where Christ
[4509.74 --> 4510.12]  is,
[4510.40 --> 4511.04]  seated at
[4511.04 --> 4511.40]  the right
[4511.40 --> 4511.84]  hand of
[4511.84 --> 4512.18]  God.
[4512.80 --> 4513.36]  You have
[4513.36 --> 4514.14]  been raised.
[4514.14 --> 4515.04]  He makes
[4515.04 --> 4515.38]  the same
[4515.38 --> 4516.04]  point in
[4516.04 --> 4516.52]  Ephesians.
[4516.84 --> 4517.30]  And God
[4517.30 --> 4518.22]  raised us
[4518.22 --> 4518.88]  up with
[4518.88 --> 4519.56]  Christ and
[4519.56 --> 4520.18]  seated us
[4520.18 --> 4520.78]  with him
[4520.78 --> 4521.26]  in the
[4521.26 --> 4522.04]  heavenly realms
[4522.04 --> 4523.52]  in Jesus.
[4524.16 --> 4525.08]  In some
[4525.08 --> 4525.52]  way,
[4525.68 --> 4525.92]  yes,
[4526.02 --> 4526.30]  in a
[4526.30 --> 4526.68]  spiritual
[4526.68 --> 4527.20]  way,
[4527.32 --> 4527.58]  but a
[4527.58 --> 4528.12]  very real
[4528.12 --> 4528.42]  way,
[4528.50 --> 4528.90]  nonetheless,
[4529.42 --> 4529.94]  you are
[4529.94 --> 4530.62]  already
[4530.62 --> 4531.32]  raised
[4531.32 --> 4531.96]  with
[4531.96 --> 4532.56]  Christ.
[4533.84 --> 4534.40]  That's
[4534.40 --> 4534.66]  what it
[4534.66 --> 4535.12]  means when
[4535.12 --> 4535.36]  I say
[4535.36 --> 4535.64]  that the
[4535.64 --> 4536.26]  best thing
[4536.26 --> 4536.58]  that could
[4536.58 --> 4537.10]  ever happen
[4537.10 --> 4537.62]  to us
[4537.62 --> 4538.24]  already
[4538.24 --> 4539.08]  has.
[4540.10 --> 4540.38]  Because
[4540.38 --> 4540.56]  we're
[4540.56 --> 4541.12]  already
[4541.12 --> 4541.80]  raised
[4541.80 --> 4542.14]  with him.
[4542.20 --> 4542.58]  Because
[4542.58 --> 4543.16]  of the
[4543.16 --> 4543.64]  resurrection
[4543.64 --> 4544.40]  of Jesus,
[4544.76 --> 4545.20]  the very
[4545.20 --> 4545.96]  order of
[4545.96 --> 4546.72]  things has
[4546.72 --> 4547.52]  changed.
[4550.08 --> 4550.98]  In fact,
[4552.02 --> 4553.68]  this has
[4553.68 --> 4553.94]  been the
[4553.94 --> 4554.96]  message of
[4554.96 --> 4555.36]  the gospel
[4555.36 --> 4555.80]  and of
[4555.80 --> 4556.26]  the church
[4556.26 --> 4557.94]  for millennia.
[4558.56 --> 4559.06]  This is the
[4559.06 --> 4559.56]  message we
[4559.56 --> 4560.00]  rehearse
[4560.00 --> 4561.60]  every Sunday.
[4562.88 --> 4563.32]  There's a
[4563.32 --> 4564.64]  quote from
[4564.64 --> 4566.08]  a gentleman.
[4566.28 --> 4566.64]  His name
[4566.64 --> 4567.32]  is Peter
[4567.32 --> 4568.54]  Chrysologos.
[4569.02 --> 4569.62]  He was
[4569.62 --> 4570.18]  known in
[4570.18 --> 4570.88]  history as
[4570.88 --> 4571.48]  the doctor
[4571.48 --> 4572.32]  of homilies.
[4572.32 --> 4573.52]  apparently
[4573.52 --> 4573.86]  he was
[4573.86 --> 4574.28]  quite a
[4574.28 --> 4574.56]  preacher.
[4575.26 --> 4575.62]  He's
[4575.62 --> 4576.34]  a 5th
[4576.34 --> 4576.96]  century,
[4577.28 --> 4578.02]  so he
[4578.02 --> 4578.50]  died in
[4578.50 --> 4579.56]  450 AD,
[4579.96 --> 4580.82]  5th century
[4580.82 --> 4581.48]  Christian
[4581.48 --> 4582.32]  bishop in
[4582.32 --> 4582.86]  the Italian
[4582.86 --> 4583.88]  city of
[4583.88 --> 4584.36]  Ravenna,
[4584.46 --> 4584.88]  which is a
[4584.88 --> 4585.56]  northern city.
[4586.34 --> 4586.74]  At the
[4586.74 --> 4587.42]  time when
[4587.42 --> 4587.86]  he is
[4587.86 --> 4588.50]  bishop there,
[4588.86 --> 4589.08]  this is
[4589.08 --> 4589.60]  actually,
[4590.04 --> 4590.68]  Ravenna is
[4590.68 --> 4591.42]  the capital
[4591.42 --> 4592.66]  of the
[4592.66 --> 4593.58]  western
[4593.58 --> 4594.48]  holy
[4594.48 --> 4594.80]  Roman
[4594.80 --> 4595.30]  empire.
[4596.04 --> 4596.42]  So he's,
[4596.96 --> 4597.28]  it's a
[4597.28 --> 4597.74]  significant
[4597.74 --> 4598.20]  position.
[4598.20 --> 4598.74]  he says
[4598.74 --> 4599.66]  powerfully,
[4600.66 --> 4601.24]  the order
[4601.24 --> 4602.00]  of things
[4602.00 --> 4603.18]  has changed.
[4604.02 --> 4604.82]  The tomb
[4604.82 --> 4605.66]  devours
[4605.66 --> 4606.34]  death
[4606.34 --> 4607.30]  and not
[4607.30 --> 4607.70]  the dead.
[4608.72 --> 4609.48]  The house
[4609.48 --> 4610.16]  of death
[4610.16 --> 4611.24]  becomes the
[4611.24 --> 4611.74]  mansion
[4611.74 --> 4613.58]  of life.
[4615.04 --> 4615.84]  Did you
[4615.84 --> 4616.24]  hear that?
[4617.32 --> 4618.50]  The tomb
[4618.50 --> 4619.10]  devours
[4619.10 --> 4619.74]  death
[4619.74 --> 4620.70]  and not
[4620.70 --> 4621.60]  those
[4621.60 --> 4622.44]  within it.
[4623.26 --> 4624.12]  Because the
[4624.12 --> 4624.88]  tomb is
[4624.88 --> 4625.70]  empty,
[4626.16 --> 4626.88]  death is
[4626.88 --> 4627.68]  now defeated
[4627.68 --> 4628.48]  and you
[4628.48 --> 4629.54]  are set
[4629.54 --> 4630.44]  free to
[4630.44 --> 4631.58]  live life
[4631.58 --> 4632.60]  in Jesus
[4632.60 --> 4633.32]  Christ
[4633.32 --> 4634.16]  abundantly.
[4636.20 --> 4637.08]  This is
[4637.08 --> 4638.40]  the claim
[4638.40 --> 4639.04]  of the
[4639.04 --> 4639.52]  resurrection
[4639.52 --> 4640.40]  that because
[4640.40 --> 4641.50]  God is
[4641.50 --> 4642.54]  not dead,
[4642.66 --> 4643.56]  because Jesus
[4643.56 --> 4644.44]  has been
[4644.44 --> 4645.04]  raised,
[4645.32 --> 4645.84]  you do
[4645.84 --> 4646.44]  not need
[4646.44 --> 4647.12]  to fear
[4647.12 --> 4648.52]  not even
[4648.52 --> 4649.42]  death.
[4652.42 --> 4653.24]  And the
[4653.24 --> 4653.94]  second claim
[4653.94 --> 4654.98]  of the
[4654.98 --> 4655.48]  resurrection,
[4655.98 --> 4656.32]  the second
[4656.32 --> 4656.80]  claim of
[4656.80 --> 4657.26]  resurrection
[4657.26 --> 4658.68]  Sunday,
[4659.26 --> 4659.80]  the second
[4659.80 --> 4660.30]  claim that
[4660.30 --> 4660.90]  we rehearse
[4660.90 --> 4661.86]  every week
[4661.86 --> 4662.76]  is that
[4662.76 --> 4663.40]  resurrected
[4663.40 --> 4664.74]  people have
[4664.74 --> 4666.18]  a mission.
[4667.06 --> 4667.48]  Do not
[4667.48 --> 4668.18]  be afraid,
[4668.36 --> 4668.98]  Jesus says,
[4669.08 --> 4669.72]  go and
[4669.72 --> 4670.82]  tell my
[4670.82 --> 4671.58]  brothers.
[4671.84 --> 4673.18]  Go and
[4673.18 --> 4674.06]  tell.
[4674.86 --> 4675.50]  This is
[4675.50 --> 4676.38]  our purpose
[4676.38 --> 4677.16]  now,
[4677.44 --> 4678.12]  to tell
[4678.12 --> 4678.80]  of this
[4678.80 --> 4679.52]  resurrected
[4679.52 --> 4680.42]  Jesus,
[4680.64 --> 4680.94]  to be
[4680.94 --> 4681.84]  used by
[4681.84 --> 4683.08]  God in
[4683.08 --> 4683.58]  all the
[4683.58 --> 4684.38]  corners and
[4684.38 --> 4685.38]  spheres of
[4685.38 --> 4685.98]  our lives,
[4686.06 --> 4687.00]  to proclaim
[4687.00 --> 4687.76]  his
[4687.76 --> 4688.58]  redemption,
[4688.96 --> 4689.32]  to be
[4689.32 --> 4690.08]  used of
[4690.08 --> 4690.42]  God,
[4690.52 --> 4691.42]  to declare
[4691.42 --> 4692.06]  his kingdom
[4692.06 --> 4692.68]  come and
[4692.68 --> 4693.14]  his kingdom
[4693.14 --> 4693.58]  coming.
[4694.50 --> 4694.78]  And so
[4694.78 --> 4695.48]  whether you
[4695.48 --> 4696.82]  preach
[4696.82 --> 4698.06]  every Sunday
[4698.06 --> 4699.12]  or whether
[4699.12 --> 4700.68]  you work
[4700.68 --> 4701.40]  construction
[4701.40 --> 4702.48]  every day,
[4702.70 --> 4703.36]  you are
[4703.36 --> 4703.96]  preaching
[4703.96 --> 4705.16]  the resurrection
[4705.16 --> 4705.74]  Sunday,
[4706.22 --> 4707.06]  truth of
[4707.06 --> 4707.42]  who God
[4707.42 --> 4707.70]  is.
[4708.70 --> 4709.62]  This is
[4709.62 --> 4710.16]  what we do.
[4710.16 --> 4710.88]  this is
[4710.88 --> 4712.42]  our mission
[4712.42 --> 4713.20]  together,
[4713.36 --> 4713.98]  to go
[4713.98 --> 4715.64]  and tell,
[4715.84 --> 4716.86]  to declare
[4716.86 --> 4717.98]  the truth
[4717.98 --> 4719.10]  that the
[4719.10 --> 4719.56]  tomb
[4719.56 --> 4721.20]  is empty.
[4721.90 --> 4722.60]  And because
[4722.60 --> 4723.50]  that tomb
[4723.50 --> 4724.74]  is empty,
[4725.18 --> 4726.26]  we are
[4726.26 --> 4726.66]  not
[4726.66 --> 4727.72]  afraid.
[4729.38 --> 4730.26]  But the
[4730.26 --> 4730.86]  great reality
[4730.86 --> 4731.34]  for most
[4731.34 --> 4732.04]  of us is
[4732.04 --> 4733.98]  that we
[4733.98 --> 4734.34]  can sit
[4734.34 --> 4735.50]  here on
[4735.50 --> 4735.86]  Sunday
[4735.86 --> 4736.68]  and say,
[4736.78 --> 4737.00]  yes,
[4737.00 --> 4737.54]  I am not
[4737.54 --> 4738.00]  afraid.
[4739.30 --> 4739.68]  But then
[4739.68 --> 4740.44]  Monday comes,
[4741.20 --> 4742.06]  or that
[4742.06 --> 4742.64]  conversation
[4742.64 --> 4743.76]  happens,
[4744.48 --> 4745.16]  or that
[4745.16 --> 4745.68]  person
[4745.68 --> 4746.68]  shows up,
[4747.14 --> 4747.84]  and then we
[4747.84 --> 4748.06]  don't know
[4748.06 --> 4748.50]  what to do,
[4748.96 --> 4749.42]  and we
[4749.42 --> 4749.64]  don't know
[4749.64 --> 4749.88]  what to
[4749.88 --> 4750.08]  say.
[4751.64 --> 4752.12]  And our
[4752.12 --> 4752.70]  God gives
[4752.70 --> 4753.58]  us provision
[4753.58 --> 4754.28]  for that
[4754.28 --> 4754.98]  too.
[4755.66 --> 4756.12]  Not only
[4756.12 --> 4756.44]  does he
[4756.44 --> 4757.00]  promise to
[4757.00 --> 4757.30]  give us
[4757.30 --> 4757.88]  words in
[4757.88 --> 4758.26]  the power
[4758.26 --> 4758.50]  of the
[4758.50 --> 4759.04]  Holy Spirit,
[4759.34 --> 4759.66]  but he
[4759.66 --> 4760.82]  promises to
[4760.82 --> 4761.86]  nourish and
[4761.86 --> 4762.88]  sustain us
[4762.88 --> 4763.38]  for these
[4763.38 --> 4763.92]  journeys of
[4763.92 --> 4764.14]  faith.
[4764.60 --> 4764.96]  And that's
[4764.96 --> 4765.40]  why we come
[4765.40 --> 4765.68]  to this
[4765.68 --> 4766.94]  table after
[4766.94 --> 4767.34]  the word.
[4768.30 --> 4768.78]  As we
[4768.78 --> 4769.58]  rehearse the
[4769.58 --> 4770.04]  resurrection
[4770.04 --> 4770.76]  story,
[4770.98 --> 4771.60]  we come
[4771.60 --> 4772.06]  to this
[4772.06 --> 4772.82]  table to
[4772.82 --> 4774.10]  receive the
[4774.10 --> 4774.66]  resurrected
[4774.66 --> 4775.78]  Jesus in
[4775.78 --> 4776.74]  power and
[4776.74 --> 4777.62]  to be filled
[4777.62 --> 4778.66]  with his
[4778.66 --> 4779.34]  presence so
[4779.34 --> 4779.60]  that it
[4779.60 --> 4780.34]  might overflow
[4780.34 --> 4781.90]  through us
[4781.90 --> 4782.60]  to those
[4782.60 --> 4783.36]  around us.
[4783.42 --> 4784.16]  And so we
[4784.16 --> 4784.68]  come to
[4784.68 --> 4785.44]  this table
[4785.44 --> 4786.76]  because he
[4786.76 --> 4787.56]  first came
[4787.56 --> 4788.12]  to us.
[4788.28 --> 4788.68]  We come
[4788.68 --> 4789.14]  to this
[4789.14 --> 4790.28]  table because
[4790.28 --> 4792.20]  he is
[4792.20 --> 4793.02]  resurrected.
[4793.64 --> 4794.16]  We come
[4794.16 --> 4794.62]  to this
[4794.62 --> 4795.70]  table because
[4795.70 --> 4796.76]  he sends
[4796.76 --> 4797.50]  us out
[4797.50 --> 4798.12]  in the
[4798.12 --> 4798.82]  power of
[4798.82 --> 4799.32]  his name
[4799.32 --> 4799.74]  with the
[4799.74 --> 4800.48]  message of
[4800.48 --> 4801.50]  his gospel
[4801.50 --> 4802.22]  and he
[4802.22 --> 4803.00]  gives us
[4803.00 --> 4803.78]  these as
[4803.78 --> 4804.26]  both an
[4804.26 --> 4805.06]  image of
[4805.06 --> 4805.84]  what that
[4805.84 --> 4806.52]  looks like
[4806.52 --> 4807.24]  but also
[4807.24 --> 4808.50]  as a sign
[4808.50 --> 4809.26]  and a
[4809.26 --> 4810.20]  seal of
[4810.20 --> 4811.10]  its truth
[4811.10 --> 4812.50]  in your
[4812.50 --> 4813.22]  life.
[4814.06 --> 4814.86]  As we
[4814.86 --> 4815.30]  come to
[4815.30 --> 4815.94]  this table
[4815.94 --> 4817.66]  to be fed
[4817.66 --> 4818.10]  by our
[4818.10 --> 4818.38]  Lord,
[4818.82 --> 4819.26]  we will
[4819.26 --> 4819.84]  do so
[4819.84 --> 4820.74]  in a
[4820.74 --> 4821.22]  special
[4821.22 --> 4821.90]  Easter
[4821.90 --> 4822.90]  liturgy.
[4822.90 --> 4823.44]  So I
[4823.44 --> 4823.86]  invite you
[4823.86 --> 4824.40]  to follow
[4824.40 --> 4825.08]  along
[4825.08 --> 4826.34]  as we
[4826.34 --> 4827.42]  see this
[4827.42 --> 4828.50]  liturgy
[4828.50 --> 4828.94]  on the
[4828.94 --> 4829.32]  screen
[4829.32 --> 4830.26]  behind us.
[4830.34 --> 4830.62]  And the
[4830.62 --> 4831.70]  first words
[4831.70 --> 4832.88]  are yours.
[4834.18 --> 4835.10]  Glory to
[4835.10 --> 4835.46]  you,
[4835.78 --> 4836.16]  O Lord
[4836.16 --> 4836.60]  our God.
[4837.26 --> 4837.94]  On this
[4837.94 --> 4838.48]  day you
[4838.48 --> 4839.36]  won victory
[4839.36 --> 4840.28]  over death,
[4840.48 --> 4841.30]  raising Jesus
[4841.30 --> 4841.82]  from the
[4841.82 --> 4842.64]  grave and
[4842.64 --> 4843.30]  giving us
[4843.30 --> 4844.28]  eternal life.
[4845.42 --> 4846.28]  Glory to
[4846.28 --> 4846.62]  you,
[4846.86 --> 4847.04]  O Lord
[4847.04 --> 4847.36]  Christ.
[4847.36 --> 4848.80]  us and
[4848.80 --> 4849.30]  for our
[4849.30 --> 4849.88]  salvation
[4849.88 --> 4850.40]  you
[4850.40 --> 4851.20]  overcame
[4851.20 --> 4851.88]  death and
[4851.88 --> 4853.08]  opened the
[4853.08 --> 4853.86]  gate to
[4853.86 --> 4854.54]  everlasting
[4854.54 --> 4855.20]  life.
[4856.44 --> 4857.42]  Glory to
[4857.42 --> 4857.76]  you,
[4857.88 --> 4858.40]  O Lord
[4858.40 --> 4858.82]  Spirit.
[4859.46 --> 4860.50]  You lead
[4860.50 --> 4861.66]  us into
[4861.66 --> 4862.70]  the truth.
[4863.74 --> 4864.58]  Glory to
[4864.58 --> 4864.94]  you,
[4865.12 --> 4865.68]  O blessed
[4865.68 --> 4866.22]  Trinity,
[4866.82 --> 4867.60]  now and
[4867.60 --> 4868.08]  forever.
[4868.52 --> 4868.98]  Amen.
[4869.48 --> 4870.04]  Let's
[4870.04 --> 4870.26]  pray.
[4873.92 --> 4874.86]  Gracious
[4874.86 --> 4875.24]  God,
[4875.92 --> 4876.66]  pour out
[4876.66 --> 4877.46]  your Holy
[4877.46 --> 4878.44]  Spirit upon
[4878.44 --> 4879.00]  us that
[4879.00 --> 4879.44]  the bread
[4879.44 --> 4880.06]  we break
[4880.06 --> 4880.40]  and the
[4880.40 --> 4880.92]  cup we
[4880.92 --> 4881.88]  bless may
[4881.88 --> 4882.58]  be the
[4882.58 --> 4883.54]  communion of
[4883.54 --> 4884.04]  the body
[4884.04 --> 4884.68]  and blood
[4884.68 --> 4885.46]  of Christ.
[4886.38 --> 4887.20]  By your
[4887.20 --> 4887.88]  Spirit make
[4887.88 --> 4888.66]  us one with
[4888.66 --> 4889.32]  Christ that
[4889.32 --> 4889.96]  we may be
[4889.96 --> 4890.46]  one with
[4890.46 --> 4890.96]  all who
[4890.96 --> 4891.62]  share this
[4891.62 --> 4891.96]  feast,
[4892.34 --> 4893.04]  united in
[4893.04 --> 4893.72]  ministry in
[4893.72 --> 4894.60]  every place.
[4895.86 --> 4896.44]  As this
[4896.44 --> 4897.08]  bread is
[4897.08 --> 4897.96]  Christ's body
[4897.96 --> 4898.68]  for us,
[4898.88 --> 4899.72]  send us out
[4899.72 --> 4900.52]  to be the
[4900.52 --> 4901.10]  body of
[4901.10 --> 4902.32]  Christ in
[4902.32 --> 4902.74]  the world.
[4903.54 --> 4903.88]  Amen.
[4906.66 --> 4908.30]  Is not
[4908.30 --> 4908.80]  the bread
[4908.80 --> 4909.24]  that we
[4909.24 --> 4910.36]  break a
[4910.36 --> 4911.50]  sharing in
[4911.50 --> 4911.98]  the body
[4911.98 --> 4912.72]  of Christ?
[4914.50 --> 4914.90]  We
[4914.90 --> 4915.16]  need
[4915.16 --> 4915.40]  the
[4915.40 --> 4915.64]  bread
[4915.64 --> 4916.84]  of our
[4916.84 --> 4917.32]  body,
[4917.72 --> 4918.26]  for we
[4918.26 --> 4918.94]  all care
[4918.94 --> 4919.56]  in the
[4919.56 --> 4919.88]  moment.
[4924.68 --> 4925.54]  Is not
[4925.54 --> 4926.00]  the cup
[4926.00 --> 4926.50]  for which
[4926.50 --> 4926.92]  we give
[4926.92 --> 4927.76]  thanks a
[4927.76 --> 4928.60]  sharing in
[4928.60 --> 4929.14]  the blood
[4929.14 --> 4929.88]  of Christ?
[4929.88 --> 4931.54]  The
[4931.54 --> 4931.96]  cup
[4931.96 --> 4932.38]  that we
[4932.38 --> 4933.14]  drink is
[4933.14 --> 4933.44]  our
[4933.44 --> 4934.28]  participation
[4934.28 --> 4934.96]  in the
[4934.96 --> 4935.42]  blood of
[4935.42 --> 4935.84]  Christ.
[4937.48 --> 4938.20]  Together
[4938.20 --> 4939.26]  we pray.
[4940.80 --> 4941.50]  Holy
[4941.50 --> 4941.98]  Father,
[4942.62 --> 4943.28]  in thanks
[4943.28 --> 4943.68]  for the
[4943.68 --> 4944.20]  sacrifice
[4944.20 --> 4944.98]  of Jesus
[4944.98 --> 4945.54]  Christ,
[4946.20 --> 4946.62]  in the
[4946.62 --> 4947.22]  joy of
[4947.22 --> 4947.42]  his
[4947.42 --> 4948.02]  resurrection,
[4948.62 --> 4949.16]  in the
[4949.16 --> 4949.76]  hope of
[4949.76 --> 4950.30]  his coming
[4950.30 --> 4950.82]  again,
[4951.28 --> 4952.16]  we present
[4952.16 --> 4953.26]  ourselves a
[4953.26 --> 4954.16]  living sacrifice
[4954.16 --> 4955.42]  and come
[4955.42 --> 4955.86]  to the
[4955.86 --> 4956.72]  table of
[4956.72 --> 4957.22]  our Lord.
[4958.06 --> 4959.20]  This is
[4959.20 --> 4959.98]  the mystery
[4959.98 --> 4960.92]  of our
[4960.92 --> 4961.30]  faith.
[4962.16 --> 4962.70]  Your
[4962.70 --> 4963.06]  death,
[4963.26 --> 4963.84]  O Christ,
[4963.84 --> 4964.64]  we proclaim.
[4965.26 --> 4965.60]  Your
[4965.60 --> 4966.24]  resurrection,
[4966.68 --> 4967.20]  we affirm
[4967.20 --> 4967.86]  with joy.
[4968.54 --> 4968.78]  Your
[4968.78 --> 4969.32]  coming,
[4969.54 --> 4970.08]  we await
[4970.08 --> 4970.70]  with hope.
[4971.42 --> 4972.18]  Glory be
[4972.18 --> 4972.74]  to you,
[4972.88 --> 4973.54]  Lord Jesus.
[4974.98 --> 4975.82]  Hear the
[4975.82 --> 4976.76]  words of
[4976.76 --> 4977.28]  our Savior.
[4977.98 --> 4978.52]  Come to
[4978.52 --> 4978.90]  me,
[4979.10 --> 4979.96]  all who
[4979.96 --> 4981.40]  labor and
[4981.40 --> 4982.08]  are heavy
[4982.08 --> 4982.56]  laden,
[4982.70 --> 4983.18]  and I
[4983.18 --> 4983.80]  will give
[4983.80 --> 4984.86]  you rest.
[4985.30 --> 4985.86]  Take my
[4985.86 --> 4986.48]  yoke upon
[4986.48 --> 4986.90]  you and
[4986.90 --> 4987.48]  learn from
[4987.48 --> 4987.68]  me,
[4987.84 --> 4988.42]  for I am
[4988.42 --> 4989.10]  gentle and
[4989.10 --> 4989.60]  humble in
[4989.60 --> 4989.86]  heart,
[4990.02 --> 4990.50]  and you
[4990.50 --> 4991.08]  will find
[4991.08 --> 4992.12]  rest for
[4992.12 --> 4992.66]  your souls.
[4992.66 --> 4994.40]  come,
[4994.82 --> 4995.08]  then,
[4995.52 --> 4996.14]  for all
[4996.14 --> 4996.74]  is ready.
[4997.38 --> 4997.86]  We come
[4997.86 --> 4998.66]  not because
[4998.66 --> 4999.28]  we ought,
[4999.42 --> 5000.02]  but because
[5000.02 --> 5000.52]  we may.
[5000.88 --> 5001.50]  Not because
[5001.50 --> 5001.82]  we are
[5001.82 --> 5002.12]  righteous,
[5002.38 --> 5002.92]  but because
[5002.92 --> 5003.44]  we are
[5003.44 --> 5004.30]  penitent.
[5004.52 --> 5005.28]  Not because
[5005.28 --> 5005.60]  we are
[5005.60 --> 5006.10]  strong,
[5006.26 --> 5006.90]  but because
[5006.90 --> 5007.66]  we are
[5007.66 --> 5007.98]  weak.
[5008.14 --> 5008.78]  Not because
[5008.78 --> 5009.20]  we are
[5009.20 --> 5009.62]  whole,
[5009.76 --> 5010.38]  but because
[5010.38 --> 5011.74]  we are
[5011.74 --> 5012.50]  broken.
[5013.36 --> 5013.70]  Come.
[5014.08 --> 5014.62]  If you
[5014.62 --> 5015.06]  are here
[5015.06 --> 5015.82]  with us
[5015.82 --> 5016.62]  this morning,
[5016.70 --> 5017.06]  or if you
[5017.06 --> 5017.32]  are at
[5017.32 --> 5017.86]  home and
[5017.86 --> 5018.34]  online,
[5018.76 --> 5019.08]  come,
[5019.08 --> 5019.46]  because
[5019.46 --> 5019.80]  it is
[5019.80 --> 5020.28]  Christ
[5020.28 --> 5020.56]  who
[5020.56 --> 5021.02]  invites
[5021.02 --> 5021.32]  us
[5021.32 --> 5021.76]  to
[5021.76 --> 5022.04]  meet
[5022.04 --> 5022.28]  him
[5022.28 --> 5022.70]  here,
[5022.70 --> 5023.16]  and
[5023.16 --> 5023.46]  because
[5023.46 --> 5024.02]  Christ
[5024.02 --> 5025.06]  is
[5025.06 --> 5025.88]  risen.
[5026.96 --> 5027.54]  The gifts
[5027.54 --> 5028.06]  of God
[5028.06 --> 5029.06]  for the
[5029.06 --> 5029.54]  people of
[5029.54 --> 5029.80]  God.
[5030.84 --> 5031.54]  As we
[5031.54 --> 5031.90]  come to
[5031.90 --> 5032.42]  this table,
[5033.22 --> 5033.58]  we will
[5033.58 --> 5034.18]  come up
[5034.18 --> 5034.98]  in groups,
[5035.66 --> 5036.32]  and there
[5036.32 --> 5036.60]  will be
[5036.60 --> 5037.28]  elders who
[5037.28 --> 5038.32]  will usher
[5038.32 --> 5038.66]  you to
[5038.66 --> 5039.10]  the front
[5039.10 --> 5039.68]  and gather
[5039.68 --> 5040.38]  around in
[5040.38 --> 5040.78]  a circle
[5040.78 --> 5041.12]  here.
[5042.06 --> 5042.74]  We will
[5042.74 --> 5043.28]  pass the
[5043.28 --> 5043.72]  elements
[5043.72 --> 5044.38]  to the
[5044.38 --> 5044.66]  person
[5044.66 --> 5045.42]  beside us.
[5046.24 --> 5046.38]  Now,
[5046.46 --> 5047.16]  ordinarily,
[5047.60 --> 5048.72]  what we
[5048.72 --> 5049.24]  do when
[5049.24 --> 5049.68]  we pass
[5049.68 --> 5049.86]  the
[5049.86 --> 5050.26]  elements
[5050.26 --> 5050.74]  is we
[5050.74 --> 5051.22]  say the
[5051.22 --> 5051.72]  body of
[5051.72 --> 5052.18]  Christ
[5052.18 --> 5053.02]  given for
[5053.02 --> 5053.34]  you.
[5053.58 --> 5053.90]  This
[5053.90 --> 5054.26]  morning,
[5054.46 --> 5054.86]  I would
[5054.86 --> 5055.26]  like you
[5055.26 --> 5055.78]  to say
[5055.78 --> 5056.32]  Christ
[5056.32 --> 5057.00]  is risen,
[5057.68 --> 5057.96]  and then
[5057.96 --> 5058.30]  as you
[5058.30 --> 5058.94]  receive the
[5058.94 --> 5059.40]  elements,
[5059.62 --> 5059.90]  say,
[5060.26 --> 5060.58]  he is
[5060.58 --> 5060.92]  risen
[5060.92 --> 5061.46]  indeed.
[5062.38 --> 5062.82]  Okay,
[5062.88 --> 5063.08]  so it's
[5063.08 --> 5063.20]  going to
[5063.20 --> 5063.50]  sound a
[5063.50 --> 5063.70]  little bit
[5063.70 --> 5064.00]  different.
[5064.82 --> 5065.12]  Christ
[5065.12 --> 5065.72]  is risen,
[5066.54 --> 5066.92]  he is
[5066.92 --> 5067.18]  risen
[5067.18 --> 5067.58]  indeed.
[5068.30 --> 5068.92]  For the
[5068.92 --> 5069.48]  first table,
[5069.62 --> 5069.92]  I'm going
[5069.92 --> 5070.36]  to invite
[5070.36 --> 5071.12]  the worship
[5071.12 --> 5072.06]  volunteers and

[5072.66 --> 5072.98]  who are

[5074.26 --> 5074.68]  the front
[5074.68 --> 5075.42]  that they
[5075.42 --> 5076.04]  might receive
[5076.04 --> 5076.70]  and then
[5076.70 --> 5077.26]  facilitate
[5077.26 --> 5078.06]  our
[5078.06 --> 5078.54]  receiving.
[5078.94 --> 5079.40]  If you
[5079.40 --> 5080.00]  are unable
[5080.00 --> 5080.46]  to come
[5080.46 --> 5080.74]  up to
[5080.74 --> 5081.10]  the front
[5081.10 --> 5081.42]  but would
[5081.42 --> 5081.80]  like to

[5082.78 --> 5083.24]  please just
[5083.24 --> 5083.98]  indicate that
[5083.98 --> 5084.60]  to the
[5084.60 --> 5085.38]  serving elder
[5085.38 --> 5085.82]  and they
[5085.82 --> 5086.18]  will meet
[5086.18 --> 5087.00]  you in
[5087.00 --> 5087.46]  your spot
[5087.46 --> 5088.04]  and serve
[5088.04 --> 5088.50]  you there.
[5089.88 --> 5090.66]  And if
[5090.66 --> 5091.86]  you require
[5091.86 --> 5092.62]  gluten-free
[5092.62 --> 5093.02]  bread,
[5093.24 --> 5093.66]  there's little
[5093.66 --> 5094.26]  cups in
[5094.26 --> 5094.68]  the middle
[5094.68 --> 5095.76]  that have
