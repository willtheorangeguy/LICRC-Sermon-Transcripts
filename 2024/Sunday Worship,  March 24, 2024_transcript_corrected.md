[3092.42 → 3095.24] From the grave to the sky.
[3095.24 → 3099.24] Lord, I lift your name on high.
[3099.24 → 3104.24] Lord, I lift your name on high.
[3104.24 → 3113.54] So, my debt to love to sing yourếnowin' Agra.
[3113.54 → 3123.48] Okay, I'd like to invite all the kids up front for children's worship time.
[3133.34 → 3137.20] So are these the last few kids that didn't get to go anywhere on spring break?
[3137.28 → 3138.26] Is that what's going on here?
[3138.86 → 3140.58] Yeah, I'm stuck at home too.
[3141.16 → 3142.08] I know your pain.
[3142.08 → 3144.40] How are you guys doing this morning?
[3144.46 → 3144.98] Let me hear you.
[3145.76 → 3147.40] All right, very good.
[3148.36 → 3148.92] Do you?
[3149.26 → 3150.18] Because no school?
[3151.94 → 3152.52] Right on.
[3152.74 → 3153.72] I got a question for you.
[3153.78 → 3157.36] You guys have probably been playing outside for the last week because you've been away home from school.
[3157.44 → 3163.48] Does anybody, did anybody get hurt this week playing outside, falling off your bike, your scooter, anything like that?
[3163.54 → 3163.70] Yeah?
[3165.76 → 3166.94] Blister from rollerblading?
[3167.04 → 3167.38] How about you?
[3167.42 → 3168.44] Did you get hurt this week?
[3170.08 → 3170.48] Yeah.
[3170.48 → 3170.56] Yeah.
[3172.08 → 3174.14] Why is it just the boys putting their hands up here?
[3176.98 → 3181.22] Does anybody have any road rash, any like, you know, scars or any of that kind of stuff?
[3183.12 → 3183.48] Yeah.
[3183.54 → 3184.34] You fell off your bike?
[3186.18 → 3187.52] You almost fell off your scooter.
[3187.52 → 3187.58] Easter.
[3188.02 → 3191.28] Hey, who knows what's coming up next week, next weekend?
[3191.84 → 3192.24] Easter.
[3192.68 → 3194.68] And what happens on Friday at Easter?
[3196.18 → 3196.90] Good Friday.
[3197.08 → 3199.24] Good Friday, but what happens on that day?
[3199.30 → 3199.94] He rises.
[3200.46 → 3201.16] Jesus rises.
[3201.26 → 3202.28] No, that's the Sunday.
[3202.36 → 3203.34] What happens on the Friday?
[3203.72 → 3204.38] We go to church.
[3204.52 → 3205.32] We go to church.
[3205.38 → 3205.92] Good answer.
[3208.30 → 3208.78] Weekend.
[3208.88 → 3209.54] Is it church?
[3209.54 → 3211.44] That happens on Sunday.
[3211.44 → 3212.76] On Friday, he gets.
[3213.56 → 3214.26] That's right.
[3214.26 → 3214.30] Right?
[3214.72 → 3216.22] So, Jesus was.
[3216.96 → 3219.74] He suffered a lot of hurt on that Friday.
[3219.94 → 3220.20] He was.
[3220.28 → 3224.36] People were, like, hitting him and spitting on him and not being very nice to him.
[3224.88 → 3226.10] And also emotional.
[3226.80 → 3227.74] A little bit of abuse.
[3227.84 → 3227.98] Right?
[3228.02 → 3230.02] People were yelling, saying not very nice things to him.
[3230.08 → 3234.08] So, we're going to talk a bit about that in children's worship time today.
[3234.08 → 3240.12] But what I want you guys to do first is we're going to stand up and face the congregation and do the blessing.
[3241.56 → 3242.12] Ready?
[3242.78 → 3245.38] The Lord be with you.
[3245.58 → 3247.26] And also with you.
[3264.08 → 3269.80] Good morning.
[3269.96 → 3271.98] My name's Sam and I'm one of the members here.
[3272.56 → 3275.42] And it's my privilege to lead you in a church family prayer.
[3276.10 → 3279.34] Before I start with that, just have one announcement to make.
[3279.52 → 3285.82] And our condolences go out to the Roller man and the Waltzer family as the passing of Peter Roller man,
[3285.82 → 3289.00] who is a brother-in-law to Jake and also an uncle to Peter.
[3289.80 → 3292.30] So, keep them in your prayers this week.
[3292.30 → 3294.74] Please pray with me.
[3296.26 → 3299.82] We come before you, Lord, reminded of the song we just sang.
[3300.50 → 3305.08] Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come.
[3305.48 → 3307.00] With all creation I sing.
[3307.70 → 3309.00] Praise to the King of kings.
[3309.64 → 3311.94] You are my everything, and I will adore you.
[3312.74 → 3315.54] How can we express the praise that is due your name?
[3316.72 → 3319.72] As we approach Good Friday, we are reminded of the words,
[3319.72 → 3323.16] Jesus Christ, I think upon your sacrifice.
[3323.94 → 3326.24] You became nothing, poured out to death.
[3327.18 → 3332.04] Many times I've wondered at your gift of life, and I'm in that place once again.
[3333.04 → 3336.56] May we take time this week to reflect on that amazing gift of life
[3336.56 → 3340.84] that we don't deserve yet gratefully except from your amazing love.
[3340.84 → 3344.34] We now bring before you our requests.
[3344.34 → 3352.50] We continue to pray for Matt and Rachel Skipper as they faced difficult times with Rachel's health declining.
[3353.08 → 3356.68] Please be there to lift them up and to grant them your peace.
[3357.38 → 3362.36] We pray for Kobe Deborah, who continues treatment for leukemia.
[3363.20 → 3364.94] Touch her with your healing hand, we pray.
[3364.94 → 3368.46] We pray for Ellen White, who continues to gain strength,
[3368.96 → 3371.62] and pray that you would restore her to full health.
[3372.60 → 3377.30] We pray for our Mexico team, who are continuing to minister and help out in Mexico.
[3377.86 → 3382.02] We pray that they may experience the power of your spirit during their time there.
[3382.56 → 3386.94] Bring them home safely on Tuesday, we pray, as they rejoin their loved ones at home.
[3386.94 → 3395.70] We pray for comfort for those who continue to grieve the loss of parents, husband, wife, siblings, and children.
[3396.30 → 3401.80] We know that all life is in your hands, and we need your grace each moment of each day.
[3402.88 → 3405.66] Please provide new leadership for this church.
[3406.80 → 3411.62] We pray for the names to be brought forward, and for those who may minister in this church.
[3412.10 → 3416.84] May those who are approached seek your will in serving in the offices of elder and deacon.
[3417.80 → 3419.64] In the words of Isaiah, we read,
[3419.88 → 3423.86] The Lord is the everlasting God, the creator of the ends of the earth.
[3424.46 → 3428.58] He will not grow weary, and his understanding no one can fathom.
[3429.10 → 3432.34] He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak.
[3433.12 → 3435.08] Even youth grow tired and weary.
[3435.86 → 3441.58] Young men may stumble and fall, but those whose hope is in the Lord will renew their strength.
[3442.40 → 3444.16] They will soar on wings like eagles.
[3444.48 → 3446.32] They will run and not grow weary.
[3446.94 → 3448.70] They will walk and not faint.
[3450.08 → 3455.96] May your words this morning speak powerfully to us through the meditations and preaching of Pastor Chris.
[3456.78 → 3461.44] Open the eyes of our hearts, Lord, as we pray in the powerful name of Jesus.
[3462.44 → 3462.84] Amen.
[3462.84 → 3489.94] This morning for Palm Sunday, we are going to look together at Matthew 21,
[3489.94 → 3496.16] specifically the text I'm going to read before our message, and the one that will be on the screen
[3496.16 → 3503.56] behind me is verse 23 through 27, but we're really going to live in this whole first half of Matthew
[3503.56 → 3510.22] 21, and so this is a really great opportunity to open up your Bible that you brought with you,
[3510.22 → 3516.14] or if you have it on your device, to open it up to that there so that you can follow along,
[3516.14 → 3521.78] and then keep that open with you, because we're going to be referring back throughout the whole
[3521.78 → 3527.06] chapter. If you're looking for a Bible, there's a few at the back. I encourage you to grab one of
[3527.06 → 3534.34] those from there. I'm going to start by reading from Matthew 21, starting at verse 23.
[3538.14 → 3544.28] Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the
[3544.28 → 3551.40] people came to him. By what authority are you doing these things, they asked, and who gave you this
[3551.40 → 3559.64] authority? Jesus replied, I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what
[3559.64 → 3568.70] authority I am doing these things. John's baptism, where did it come from? Was it from heaven or of
[3568.70 → 3576.42] human origin? They discussed it among themselves and said, if we say from heaven, he will ask, then why
[3576.42 → 3582.42] didn't you believe him? But if we say of human origin, we are afraid of the people, for they all hold
[3582.42 → 3591.84] that John was a prophet. So they answered Jesus, we don't know. Then he said, neither will I tell you
[3591.84 → 3597.52] by what authority I am doing these things. This is the word of the Lord.
[3600.78 → 3607.86] Before we begin, in earnest, I want to just do a bit of a straw poll here and ask you a question. I
[3607.86 → 3614.50] just invite you to raise your hand in response. How many of you here this morning has made a decision?
[3617.06 → 3620.58] Some of you are deciding, do I raise my hand? Well, then you made a decision. So yes,
[3620.58 → 3628.12] raise your hand. How many of you here this morning has had a hard time making a decision before?
[3631.14 → 3635.80] There's one or two of you who are like, nope, everything I ever do is always right all the time,
[3636.28 → 3645.22] never hard. How many of you have had a hard time making what you believe to be or should be an easy
[3645.22 → 3651.76] decision? So here we're talking about like executive dysfunction, not working the way you want it to,
[3651.90 → 3659.10] right? Where you're like, do I brush my teeth now before I eat or after I eat? And then you're paralyzed
[3659.10 → 3670.74] because you can't decide. How many of you have made a decision that was made easier by the fact that
[3670.74 → 3677.64] there was a bunch of other people doing the same thing? Just think back to the beginning of
[3677.64 → 3683.36] our worship when we were invited to walk through the aisles and nobody went and then Pete doubled down
[3683.36 → 3688.58] and said, come on guys. And then finally three brave little kids came and then all of a sudden everyone
[3688.58 → 3694.14] started to come, right? Sometimes it's easier to follow and to make a decision when other people
[3694.14 → 3703.82] are doing the same. How many of you have had to make a decision when everybody was doing one thing
[3703.82 → 3715.54] that would cause you to go against the flow of everyone else? Some more hands, right? And those are even
[3715.54 → 3723.96] harder decisions to have to make. Those are even harder realities to try and live into.
[3725.10 → 3731.46] But when we make those kinds of decisions, right? The kinds of decisions that say, this is not going
[3731.46 → 3736.90] to be popular or this is going to be really hard or everyone else is going to be flowing in the other
[3736.90 → 3742.54] direction, and I'm going to have to figure out how to push my way through to against the crowd and
[3742.54 → 3752.64] against the flow. When we make those kinds of decisions, we do that, and we can do that because of
[3752.64 → 3761.84] something we value more than the opposition we're about to face, right? Or something we think is more
[3761.84 → 3765.28] important than the hardships that we know we will endure.
[3765.28 → 3775.04] As we dig into Palm Sunday and to this text, I want you to keep that in mind.
[3775.04 → 3784.76] That when you value something more than the opposition you will face, it drives you towards it.
[3784.76 → 3795.24] Because you see, Palm Sunday is about one question. And the text that we read and the others that we're
[3795.24 → 3803.16] going to look at really circle around one question. So, four forms of the same question giving three
[3803.16 → 3817.16] answers. You see, the triumphal entry of Jesus is a visible declaration of Jesus' authority,
[3818.12 → 3828.12] announcing him to the world as king and as messiah. The question is, how will you see it?
[3828.12 → 3836.92] And in Matthew 21, what I want to do with you this morning is trace three ways of seeing and responding
[3836.92 → 3844.80] that comes from this story. Those three ways we're going to see are indignation, skepticism, and wonder.
[3846.52 → 3855.12] Now, before we dig into that, let me just show you quickly how the triumphal entry of Jesus
[3855.12 → 3864.28] announces him as king and as messiah. And for us to do this, you need to be looking at verse 1 through 11
[3864.28 → 3872.48] of Matthew 21. And this is why it's important to have a Bible in your hand. First, in this text,
[3872.66 → 3882.32] notice that Jesus can see into the future. In verse 2, Jesus tells his disciples,
[3882.32 → 3889.54] go to the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a donkey tied there with her colt by her.
[3890.48 → 3896.12] Untie them and bring them to me. If anyone says anything to you, say that the Lord needs them,
[3896.18 → 3904.30] and he will send them right away. Right? So, Jesus says there will be a donkey and her colt there,
[3904.42 → 3909.84] and then he prepares his disciples. Right? If anyone says anything to you, tell them that the Lord needs
[3909.84 → 3915.78] them. And the way that Mark tells this story in his gospel account, someone does say, hey, why are you
[3915.78 → 3919.68] doing what you're doing? And the disciples say, the Lord needs him. And then the person's like, okay.
[3921.14 → 3929.68] Right? Jesus sees into the future. Now, notice, in the way that this story is told, and it's the same
[3929.68 → 3935.78] in Mark as well, right? In Matthew, or in the rest of the synoptic gospels, right? There's no indication
[3935.78 → 3942.36] that Jesus has been here before, or that he's made arrangements with the owner of this house and the
[3942.36 → 3950.68] owner of this donkey. Right? And part of the theological point that I believe is being made here
[3950.68 → 3960.72] is that Jesus, as the second person of the Trinity, as the Word of God incarnate, sees the world
[3960.72 → 3970.74] from a different perspective than linear progression and also isn't limited to the physical proximity of
[3970.74 → 3976.42] what his two eyes have right in front of them. Now, that's a really complicated way of saying,
[3976.82 → 3984.96] in short, Jesus sees the future because he is the ruler of the universe. He is the ruler of the world.
[3984.96 → 3993.72] Right? That's the first point that's here that tells us that Jesus is king. And then the second thing
[3993.72 → 4004.20] is that Jesus is here revealed as the fulfillment of a prophecy made in the past about this Messiah king
[4004.20 → 4011.64] to come. Right? And Matthew makes that point explicitly. He says in verse 4 of 21, if you're following along,
[4011.64 → 4021.14] this took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet. And then Matthew quotes Zechariah 9,
[4021.28 → 4029.34] verse 9, which we could read, say to daughter Zion, daughter Zion is the prophet's way of saying,
[4029.46 → 4039.70] say to the people of Jerusalem, say to daughter Zion, see your king comes to you, gentle and riding on a
[4039.70 → 4049.14] donkey and on a donkey and riding on a donkey. Now, in the next verse of that Zechariah 9 text, in verse 10,
[4050.46 → 4052.44] the prophet continues and says,
[4052.98 → 4061.78] he will proclaim peace to the nations and his rule will extend from sea to sea and from the river to the
[4061.78 → 4072.36] ends of the earth. Right? The point here, again, is confirmation that Jesus is king. And this actually,
[4072.88 → 4080.80] and this will matter when we get to our text that we read earlier, right? Matthew has been making this
[4080.80 → 4090.16] point, Jesus has been making this point from the very beginning. In Matthew 3, John announces that the
[4090.16 → 4097.32] kingdom of heaven has come near when he sees Jesus. In Matthew 4, Jesus says the exact same thing. The
[4097.32 → 4104.46] kingdom of heaven has come near. In Matthew 12, verse 28, Jesus says, the kingdom of God has come upon you.
[4104.72 → 4113.22] And in Matthew 28, at the end of the gospel account, Jesus says, all authority in heaven and on earth has
[4113.22 → 4121.82] been given to me. Right? At the birth of Jesus, you remember the Christmas story, the magi came and they
[4121.82 → 4130.34] go to Herod, and they say, where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? Near the end of the story,
[4130.48 → 4136.22] and we'll look at it later this week, Pilate asks, are you the king of the Jews? Right? There's this
[4136.22 → 4143.30] nice bookend going on here. And then the sign that's placed over Jesus' head as he hangs on the cross
[4143.30 → 4155.70] says, this is Jesus, the king of the Jews. Over and over and over again, explicitly and implicitly,
[4155.90 → 4163.06] by direct revelation or by typological fulfillment, Matthew has been making this same point over and
[4163.06 → 4171.14] over. Jesus is king. And he isn't just any kind of king. He's a special kind of king. He's a king
[4171.14 → 4178.34] from heaven. He is a divine king. And he sees the world differently than any other human king because
[4178.34 → 4185.52] this Jesus fashioned it out of nothing. Right? He's different from any kind of king that has come
[4185.52 → 4192.72] before, or he's also different from the kind of king that the people had expected, or the people had
[4192.72 → 4200.80] hoped for. Pete did a great job in his prayer, right, saying that we expected a king who would
[4200.80 → 4207.80] come and destroy our enemies, and we got a king who told us to love our enemies. Right? This Jesus is a
[4207.80 → 4214.28] different kind of king, and his kingdom is a different kind of kingdom than what you might expect.
[4214.60 → 4218.86] And that means that those who are part of that kingdom, the citizens of the kingdom of heaven,
[4218.86 → 4224.70] need to be different kind of citizens than those who are in the kingdom of the world.
[4227.20 → 4234.64] And perhaps some of these people in the story of the triumphal entry are beginning to see this.
[4235.24 → 4240.62] Right? For some of them, it's starting to click. And so they put their cloaks on the ground,
[4240.62 → 4246.72] and they cut branches from the trees for Jesus to ride over. Right? Which is sort of like a rolling
[4246.72 → 4253.70] out of the red carpet. Right? It's a way of saying, make way for the king. And actually,
[4254.42 → 4261.26] when they say, Hosanna to the son of David, this is almost exactly what they're saying.
[4262.14 → 4271.52] The word Hosanna is what's called a transliteration of a Hebrew word meaning, O Lord, save us.
[4271.52 → 4284.30] Now, a transliteration is a word from one language that is spelled and then borrowed in another language.
[4285.16 → 4292.54] And so in this case, this is a Hebrew word spelled in Greek. Another example of transliteration that
[4292.54 → 4300.00] you might know is the word karaoke. Right? Karaoke is from a Japanese word that literally means empty
[4300.00 → 4308.00] orchestra. But we say karaoke. Another word that is transliteration that you might know is the word
[4308.00 → 4313.72] kindergarten. It's actually a transliteration of a German word that means children's garden.
[4314.76 → 4320.20] And it refers to the place where the youngest of the kids would be taken care of during the education
[4320.20 → 4327.44] time for the older kids. They would play in the garden. Now, that's what we call the first level of
[4327.44 → 4336.04] school. Right? Hosanna is a transliteration of a Hebrew word into Greek. And most scholars agree
[4336.04 → 4344.36] that by this point, by this time in history, every Jew would hear the phrase, Hosanna to the son of David,
[4344.92 → 4352.32] in the same way that we, as commonwealth citizens or that people in England might hear the phrase,
[4352.32 → 4362.16] God save the king. Right? What it is, it's a title of royal acclamation. Right? Hosanna to the son of David
[4362.16 → 4371.94] is a theological statement about whom this man is. And it's a theological statement that will upset the empire.
[4371.94 → 4381.14] And so they go on, and they quote from Psalm 118, which again, very early on in the
[4381.86 → 4390.16] so the Psalter is the Jewish book of praise. It's the Jewish hymn book, what they would sing from in temple
[4390.16 → 4400.76] and in synagogue worship. And very early on in that worshipping practice, Psalm 118 emerges as a psalm of hope
[4400.76 → 4408.46] for the coming Messiah king. Right? It's a song that expresses the hope of the coming Messiah.
[4409.18 → 4415.14] And so take all of these things now and put them all together. Right? I believe that all these things
[4415.14 → 4424.50] show that the triumphal entry is the announcement of Jesus as the Messiah, as the saviour of the world
[4424.50 → 4431.40] who will bring priests, is the announcement of a king in the line of David who will have an everlasting kingdom.
[4432.40 → 4439.44] Right? Matthew is saying clearly what he has been saying throughout the whole gospel, that every hope,
[4439.76 → 4448.30] every expectation of the Messiah king are found, are rooted, and are fulfilled in this man named Jesus.
[4448.30 → 4457.06] And as Messiah king, all that's left is how the people will respond.
[4458.40 → 4462.34] All that's left is how you will respond.
[4463.76 → 4468.70] And this chapter gives us three examples of how people respond.
[4468.70 → 4473.34] In the first place, look at verse 10 of chapter 21.
[4474.88 → 4479.42] The people have proclaimed, Hosanna to the son of David. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[4479.52 → 4481.10] Hosanna in the highest heaven.
[4481.96 → 4485.18] Which again rings with what the angels declared in Luke. Right?
[4485.74 → 4488.62] In verse 10.
[4488.62 → 4493.12] When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked,
[4493.56 → 4495.54] Who is this?
[4495.54 → 4500.46] That is the question.
[4502.32 → 4502.84] Right?
[4502.90 → 4507.46] I don't believe it's an understatement to say, or an overstatement to say, rather,
[4507.56 → 4513.82] that that is the most important question that you will ever ask of yourself in this life.
[4514.00 → 4515.72] Who is Jesus?
[4517.32 → 4522.34] And depending on how you answer that question, the rest of your life is changed.
[4522.34 → 4522.52] Right?
[4523.16 → 4527.84] Depending on how you answer that question, the trajectory of your life is changed.
[4529.12 → 4529.28] Right?
[4529.32 → 4532.92] For instance, if Jesus is who he says he is,
[4533.18 → 4536.26] then you owe him everything.
[4537.70 → 4537.92] Right?
[4537.94 → 4541.02] If Jesus is who he says he is, you owe him your life.
[4542.08 → 4543.38] You owe him your love.
[4543.38 → 4547.12] If Jesus is who he says he is, you owe him your worship.
[4549.72 → 4554.70] But if he's not, well then we are most of all to be pitied.
[4555.10 → 4555.62] Says Paul.
[4556.60 → 4557.00] Right?
[4557.04 → 4559.02] If he's not, none of this, right?
[4559.06 → 4560.20] What we're doing here today.
[4560.84 → 4561.72] None of this matters.
[4561.72 → 4564.62] But even more than that, right?
[4564.72 → 4570.02] If Jesus and God isn't who he says he is,
[4570.64 → 4574.14] then it actually becomes hard to know if any of this, right?
[4574.16 → 4577.40] The world and everything in of it, to know if any of this matters.
[4578.78 → 4578.92] Right?
[4578.92 → 4581.60] If there's no sovereign king ruling history,
[4581.82 → 4587.26] you can't have any confidence that what happens in history is purposeful,
[4587.32 → 4588.72] or that it has a point.
[4588.72 → 4589.72] Right?
[4590.30 → 4592.44] If there's no God, if there's no king of history,
[4592.62 → 4594.84] we can't know that history has any meaning.
[4595.36 → 4596.36] At least not for sure.
[4597.14 → 4598.40] You can have a lot of hope.
[4600.18 → 4601.58] You can have a lot of delusion.
[4602.98 → 4604.22] But you can't be confident.
[4605.34 → 4610.04] You can only be confident that your suffering means anything
[4610.04 → 4613.14] if there is a king who is in charge of it all.
[4613.72 → 4618.16] You can only be confident that your decisions to go against the crowd and the flow
[4618.16 → 4621.60] have a value beyond themselves if there is a king
[4621.60 → 4623.78] whom you are submitting yourself to,
[4624.22 → 4625.50] whom you are trying to worship,
[4625.96 → 4628.08] who you are trying to love in response to.
[4630.04 → 4630.26] Right?
[4630.30 → 4631.68] Apart from God,
[4631.88 → 4636.08] you can't know if life has any purpose beyond your life.
[4637.36 → 4639.80] Now, I know that we live in a time and a place,
[4639.88 → 4640.42] and let's be honest,
[4640.48 → 4642.90] this has actually been true for the whole of human history, right?
[4642.90 → 4646.76] But we live in a time and a place where the modern philosophical apologists
[4646.76 → 4649.00] have pulpits that are global in their reaching,
[4649.42 → 4652.30] and they would have you accept about yourself
[4652.30 → 4655.06] that your life is ultimately meaningless.
[4657.72 → 4659.12] But I don't want that for you.
[4660.42 → 4662.12] Jesus doesn't want that for you.
[4662.12 → 4667.52] And I really do believe that if you look in your heart of hearts,
[4668.20 → 4674.92] you don't actually accept that for yourself either.
[4676.58 → 4679.20] But I think that we all intuitively believe
[4679.20 → 4683.40] that there's something more to life and to us,
[4683.56 → 4686.56] that there's something more to our purposes on this planet.
[4686.56 → 4690.72] And may I suggest to you
[4690.72 → 4697.04] that the more begins
[4697.04 → 4701.40] with a relationship to the Messiah King,
[4701.62 → 4704.52] to the one who created it all.
[4706.42 → 4708.32] Because you see, there actually is
[4708.32 → 4711.94] what the old divines have called a sunup bonus, right?
[4712.00 → 4715.22] An ultimate, true, good, and beautiful.
[4715.22 → 4718.20] And this ultimate, true, good, and beautiful.
[4718.44 → 4719.74] He wants to know you.
[4720.70 → 4723.56] He wants to love you and to be in relationship with you.
[4724.22 → 4726.42] And that's why the most important question
[4726.42 → 4728.12] is who is this?
[4728.38 → 4729.48] Who is Jesus?
[4731.50 → 4732.16] Now you'll notice,
[4732.44 → 4735.56] you'll notice the word that Matthew used
[4735.56 → 4737.56] when talking about the people.
[4738.78 → 4740.40] He says they were stirred.
[4740.40 → 4745.68] Now that's one of the few places
[4745.68 → 4748.24] in the English translation of the Bible
[4748.24 → 4750.24] where we just don't get enough.
[4751.20 → 4753.40] Because the word that's used there
[4753.40 → 4755.80] to be stirred literally means
[4755.80 → 4758.76] to rock or to tremor.
[4759.94 → 4761.80] The people are stirred up
[4761.80 → 4763.32] and it's like an uproar.
[4763.66 → 4765.42] There's an earthquake going on.
[4765.48 → 4768.88] It's almost as if a riot is about to ensue.
[4768.88 → 4770.00] And so on the one hand,
[4770.06 → 4771.12] you have this group of people
[4771.12 → 4771.80] who are shouting,
[4772.12 → 4773.92] Hosanna to the son of David!
[4774.30 → 4775.20] Hail to the king!
[4776.30 → 4776.68] Right?
[4776.70 → 4777.34] Who are declaring,
[4777.46 → 4778.34] the king has come!
[4778.46 → 4779.58] Long live the king!
[4780.32 → 4781.32] And on the other hand,
[4781.36 → 4782.38] you have a group of people
[4782.38 → 4783.54] who are responding
[4783.54 → 4784.16] and who are saying,
[4784.44 → 4785.48] whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[4785.48 → 4786.40] what's going on here?
[4786.84 → 4787.82] This isn't safe.
[4788.04 → 4788.92] This isn't right.
[4789.12 → 4789.90] This isn't good.
[4790.12 → 4792.40] Don't wake the dragon that is Rome
[4792.40 → 4794.06] by these rebellious activities.
[4794.06 → 4800.96] You see the flow of the decision process
[4800.96 → 4803.56] and the necessity of the value.
[4806.34 → 4807.72] The story goes on
[4807.72 → 4810.84] that Jesus went from this group
[4810.84 → 4813.24] and he entered the temple courts
[4813.24 → 4815.12] and he drove out all who were buying
[4815.12 → 4815.86] and selling there.
[4815.96 → 4816.94] He overturned tables
[4816.94 → 4820.18] and he cleared the court of the Gentiles,
[4820.34 → 4821.42] which was being used
[4821.42 → 4823.74] because of the Passover festival coming up.
[4824.06 → 4825.34] And the allowing,
[4825.60 → 4826.58] or not allowing,
[4826.96 → 4828.76] the God-fearing Gentiles to pray.
[4829.84 → 4831.04] And in verse 15,
[4831.18 → 4832.58] after Jesus has done this,
[4833.02 → 4833.52] we read,
[4834.52 → 4835.54] when the chief priests
[4835.54 → 4836.90] and the teachers of the law
[4836.90 → 4839.10] saw all the wonderful,
[4839.34 → 4841.58] amazing things that he had done
[4841.58 → 4842.86] and the children shouting
[4842.86 → 4843.78] in the temple courts,
[4843.86 → 4845.60] Hosanna to the son of David,
[4846.62 → 4849.34] they were indignant,
[4850.22 → 4851.40] is the word used.
[4851.40 → 4855.32] They were indignant
[4855.32 → 4856.26] and they asked,
[4856.40 → 4858.64] do you hear what these children are saying?
[4860.32 → 4861.90] That's another way of asking,
[4862.36 → 4864.54] who do you think you are?
[4866.68 → 4868.64] Who is Jesus?
[4868.64 → 4871.26] And the world
[4871.26 → 4873.82] is still full of people
[4873.82 → 4876.78] who when they hear about Jesus
[4876.78 → 4878.88] or when they ask,
[4879.00 → 4879.90] who is Jesus,
[4880.40 → 4882.86] indignation is their only response.
[4884.06 → 4886.56] Because Jesus upsets the status quo,
[4887.20 → 4888.82] especially for the chief priests
[4888.82 → 4889.88] and the teachers of the law
[4889.88 → 4891.38] who have worked carefully
[4891.38 → 4893.02] and have crafted out
[4893.02 → 4894.70] a tiny little exception
[4894.70 → 4896.68] to Roman rule in the region.
[4896.68 → 4897.48] Right?
[4897.60 → 4898.62] Jesus challenges
[4898.62 → 4900.42] their presumptions of power
[4900.42 → 4902.38] and of privilege in society.
[4903.04 → 4903.94] And often,
[4904.24 → 4905.96] when someone is challenged
[4905.96 → 4907.96] in their heart of hearts,
[4908.20 → 4909.78] the default response,
[4909.90 → 4912.02] the first response is anger,
[4912.28 → 4913.08] it is rage,
[4913.20 → 4914.20] it is never,
[4914.60 → 4914.86] no,
[4915.02 → 4915.70] not I,
[4916.06 → 4917.16] it is indignation.
[4918.20 → 4919.62] That's what's going on here.
[4920.32 → 4922.32] And part of what Jesus is showing us
[4922.32 → 4924.22] is the better way.
[4925.08 → 4925.18] Right?
[4925.22 → 4927.16] Our hearts need to be convicted
[4927.16 → 4928.88] that there is a better way.
[4930.18 → 4930.20] Right?
[4933.14 → 4933.98] Part of,
[4934.08 → 4936.40] part of the effect of sin
[4936.40 → 4938.14] in our lives
[4938.14 → 4941.18] is that we are convinced by a lie.
[4942.32 → 4942.48] Right?
[4942.50 → 4943.96] It's a lie that was first spoken
[4943.96 → 4945.00] in the Garden of Eden
[4945.00 → 4946.30] to Adam and Eve,
[4946.30 → 4948.24] and it's a lie that continues
[4948.24 → 4950.32] to whisper throughout the ages,
[4950.32 → 4952.46] did God really say?
[4953.54 → 4956.16] Does God really love you?
[4956.34 → 4960.08] Does God really have your best in mind?
[4960.96 → 4965.56] Is Jesus really the sovereign Messiah King?
[4967.64 → 4969.00] Here's the thing, right?
[4969.00 → 4971.90] People,
[4972.18 → 4976.10] people have spent lifetimes,
[4976.28 → 4979.10] people are spending lifetimes
[4979.10 → 4981.28] building up systems of thought
[4981.28 → 4983.56] and philosophies of being.
[4983.76 → 4985.40] People are spending lifetimes
[4985.40 → 4987.42] building up systems of power
[4987.42 → 4988.66] and of purpose.
[4989.14 → 4990.86] And when Jesus comes
[4990.86 → 4993.50] and he begins to challenge those things,
[4993.78 → 4995.28] the things that we have created,
[4995.40 → 4997.04] the things that we have found purpose in,
[4997.04 → 4998.22] when Jesus comes
[4998.22 → 5000.46] and he begins to upset those things
[5000.46 → 5003.50] that we have filled with our identity,
[5003.70 → 5006.20] that we have drawn our purpose from,
[5006.36 → 5007.64] the default reaction
[5007.64 → 5009.30] is to rage against it,
[5009.40 → 5010.96] is to protect the establishment
[5010.96 → 5013.20] of our ideas and our ideals.
[5014.18 → 5015.08] In the Bible,
[5015.94 → 5017.34] in the Bible,
[5017.48 → 5020.76] those things that we build our lives upon,
[5020.92 → 5022.28] those ideas that we have
[5022.28 → 5023.50] that we try to find purpose
[5023.50 → 5025.02] and meaning in,
[5025.36 → 5027.02] those things that we create,
[5027.04 → 5028.60] in order to give us a reason
[5028.60 → 5030.04] to get out of bed in the morning,
[5030.30 → 5033.40] if those things are not God in Jesus Christ,
[5033.54 → 5035.24] the Bible has a word for that.
[5036.54 → 5037.58] They're called idols.
[5039.94 → 5042.30] Idols are false gods.
[5042.52 → 5044.10] And let me be abundantly clear with you,
[5044.20 → 5047.44] idols don't have to be carved out of wood or stone.
[5048.08 → 5050.78] They don't have to be fashioned out of gold or silver.
[5050.78 → 5054.34] Any time we take something that is created
[5054.34 → 5056.84] and we give it meaning and purpose
[5056.84 → 5060.58] that we should only find in our uncreated God,
[5061.08 → 5062.30] we have made an idol.
[5063.06 → 5065.28] We have fashioned an idol.
[5066.08 → 5068.64] So an idol can be something that is good
[5068.64 → 5069.84] in and of itself
[5069.84 → 5071.94] and we turn it into an ultimate thing.
[5071.94 → 5075.38] John Calvin has said famously
[5075.38 → 5078.78] that the human heart is an idol factory.
[5079.70 → 5081.16] That our default setting now,
[5081.30 → 5082.04] because of sin,
[5082.30 → 5083.68] is to create idols.
[5084.78 → 5086.88] Because sin is first and foremost
[5086.88 → 5088.86] a rebelling against God
[5088.86 → 5091.40] and a casting off of our relationship to Him.
[5091.64 → 5093.40] What that does is it leaves a hole
[5093.40 → 5094.88] inside our hearts, right?
[5094.92 → 5096.14] Our hearts were created
[5096.14 → 5098.42] to rest in Him
[5098.42 → 5099.78] and to find our purpose
[5099.78 → 5101.14] in relationship to Him.
[5101.14 → 5102.36] And when that's gone,
[5102.68 → 5103.92] things rush in to fill it.
[5104.60 → 5106.10] And not only do things rush in,
[5106.28 → 5108.76] we actively pull things in.
[5109.66 → 5110.68] That's idolatry.
[5111.34 → 5113.52] And when those things become challenged,
[5114.20 → 5116.46] when Jesus comes along and says,
[5117.02 → 5120.60] Chris, I am the true King.
[5121.08 → 5123.64] You are made for me.
[5124.52 → 5127.66] My throne is your heart.
[5127.66 → 5130.64] Then,
[5130.64 → 5133.34] the pride
[5133.34 → 5135.60] that I have put there
[5135.60 → 5137.88] or my desire
[5137.88 → 5139.36] to be loved
[5139.36 → 5140.76] by crowds of people
[5140.76 → 5141.86] and lauded
[5141.86 → 5143.88] as an excellent speaker
[5143.88 → 5147.56] gets knocked down,
[5148.62 → 5149.86] gets pulled away,
[5150.50 → 5151.72] gets toppled.
[5151.72 → 5152.36] toppled.
[5153.68 → 5155.78] And our default response
[5155.78 → 5156.74] often
[5156.74 → 5158.68] is indignation.
[5160.86 → 5161.42] Indignation.
[5161.98 → 5162.80] And maybe that's where you're at.
[5163.02 → 5163.94] Maybe you are
[5163.94 → 5164.96] thinking of Jesus
[5164.96 → 5166.06] and you're indignant.
[5166.20 → 5166.98] How could He?
[5167.28 → 5168.32] How would He?
[5168.56 → 5169.58] How dare He?
[5170.86 → 5172.14] If that's where you're at,
[5173.14 → 5174.06] would you commit to
[5174.06 → 5175.36] talk to me
[5175.36 → 5175.90] or someone
[5175.90 → 5176.66] this week?
[5177.60 → 5178.30] Can we get together,
[5178.70 → 5179.20] have coffee?
[5179.52 → 5180.04] Can we chat
[5180.04 → 5181.08] about what that is like
[5181.08 → 5181.78] and what's going on?
[5181.98 → 5182.88] I would love for that.
[5185.28 → 5186.44] There's another response
[5186.44 → 5188.20] that's given here.
[5188.26 → 5188.66] And for this,
[5189.08 → 5190.66] look at verse 23.
[5191.52 → 5192.12] This is where
[5192.12 → 5194.02] we read together.
[5195.08 → 5195.66] Jesus entered
[5196.18 → 5196.98] the temple courts
[5196.98 → 5197.86] and He was teaching
[5197.86 → 5198.74] and the chief priests
[5198.74 → 5199.26] and the elders
[5199.26 → 5199.92] come to Him
[5199.92 → 5200.66] and they ask,
[5200.66 → 5202.32] by what authority
[5202.32 → 5203.38] are you doing
[5203.38 → 5204.02] these things?
[5204.64 → 5205.28] They ask,
[5205.28 → 5206.56] who gave you
[5206.56 → 5207.64] this authority?
[5208.68 → 5209.78] This is another way
[5209.78 → 5210.72] of asking,
[5211.00 → 5211.80] who are you?
[5212.62 → 5213.64] Who sent you?
[5214.82 → 5215.36] And notice,
[5215.56 → 5216.92] this is the only time
[5216.92 → 5217.96] in the story
[5217.96 → 5219.32] that there's no descriptor,
[5219.40 → 5220.74] there's no adjective given
[5220.74 → 5222.50] for the kind of response
[5222.50 → 5222.88] they have,
[5222.92 → 5223.70] for the feeling
[5223.70 → 5224.46] that is behind
[5224.46 → 5225.06] the questioning.
[5225.90 → 5226.76] In verse 10,
[5227.44 → 5228.06] we were told
[5228.06 → 5229.12] that the whole city
[5229.12 → 5229.80] was stirred,
[5230.00 → 5231.16] that they were trembling
[5231.16 → 5232.88] with their anxiety
[5232.88 → 5233.42] of it all.
[5233.70 → 5234.56] In verse 16,
[5234.66 → 5235.06] we were told
[5235.06 → 5236.16] that they were indignant,
[5236.34 → 5237.04] or verse 15,
[5237.16 → 5237.90] they were indignant
[5237.90 → 5238.74] and so they say,
[5238.80 → 5239.96] who do you think you are?
[5240.80 → 5241.90] And in verse 20,
[5242.08 → 5242.90] where we'll come back
[5242.90 → 5243.90] to when we end,
[5244.58 → 5244.76] right,
[5244.84 → 5246.10] the disciples saw this
[5246.10 → 5247.72] and they were amazed.
[5249.12 → 5249.96] But here,
[5250.86 → 5251.90] there's no descriptor given.
[5251.98 → 5252.10] Now,
[5252.78 → 5253.76] we read the text before,
[5253.84 → 5254.90] so you saw what's coming,
[5255.02 → 5255.22] right,
[5255.26 → 5256.56] at the end of the story
[5256.56 → 5257.46] it does say
[5257.46 → 5258.94] that they were afraid
[5258.94 → 5260.66] and so maybe
[5260.66 → 5261.24] that's part
[5261.24 → 5262.00] of what's going on,
[5262.06 → 5263.10] but their fear
[5263.10 → 5264.12] is controlling
[5264.12 → 5264.64] whether
[5264.64 → 5265.20] they will answer
[5265.20 → 5265.78] the question,
[5266.08 → 5267.84] not their asking
[5267.84 → 5268.66] of the question.
[5269.94 → 5270.54] And I think
[5270.54 → 5271.20] that's important.
[5272.36 → 5273.28] Because one of the things
[5273.28 → 5274.12] that I think we see
[5274.12 → 5275.10] here is that
[5275.10 → 5276.82] asking Jesus questions,
[5277.82 → 5278.54] who are you
[5278.54 → 5279.44] and who sent you,
[5279.96 → 5281.10] is a good thing.
[5282.38 → 5282.52] Right,
[5282.52 → 5283.72] sometimes in churches
[5283.72 → 5284.68] we are afraid
[5284.68 → 5285.62] of skepticism,
[5286.38 → 5286.52] right,
[5286.52 → 5287.62] we're afraid of doubts,
[5287.62 → 5289.54] we're afraid
[5289.54 → 5290.22] of people
[5290.22 → 5291.74] asking hard questions
[5291.74 → 5293.44] because we don't
[5293.44 → 5294.10] know the answer
[5294.10 → 5295.18] or because we think
[5295.18 → 5296.44] I have that same question
[5296.44 → 5297.90] and I need to do
[5297.90 → 5298.40] a good job
[5298.40 → 5299.00] of representing
[5299.00 → 5299.86] who Jesus is
[5299.86 → 5300.36] because I want
[5300.36 → 5300.80] this person
[5300.80 → 5301.78] to know him
[5301.78 → 5302.86] and to love him
[5302.86 → 5303.78] like I know him
[5303.78 → 5304.82] and I'm loved by him
[5304.82 → 5306.22] and so we have
[5306.22 → 5306.76] this fear.
[5308.24 → 5309.18] And then what happens
[5309.18 → 5311.68] is a culture
[5311.68 → 5313.24] of fear
[5313.24 → 5314.88] begins to develop
[5314.88 → 5315.58] and take root
[5315.58 → 5316.12] that says
[5316.12 → 5317.48] you can't ask questions.
[5318.38 → 5318.98] But that's not
[5318.98 → 5319.86] what we're modelled here.
[5320.38 → 5320.94] That's not what
[5320.94 → 5321.68] we're given here.
[5322.62 → 5322.72] Right,
[5322.82 → 5324.74] skepticism itself
[5324.74 → 5325.44] is,
[5325.76 → 5326.14] I think,
[5326.22 → 5327.62] a good thing.
[5328.82 → 5330.42] Ask your hard questions.
[5331.56 → 5331.68] Right,
[5331.70 → 5331.96] remember,
[5332.12 → 5333.04] Jesus is king.
[5333.82 → 5334.80] He is Messiah.
[5334.96 → 5335.92] He can handle
[5335.92 → 5337.18] your hard questions.
[5338.70 → 5338.84] Right,
[5338.92 → 5339.36] Jesus
[5339.36 → 5341.86] fashioned the world
[5341.86 → 5343.24] with a word.
[5344.44 → 5345.64] I think he can handle
[5345.64 → 5346.66] your words of doubt.
[5347.62 → 5348.58] and the questions
[5348.58 → 5349.02] you might have
[5349.02 → 5349.60] to bring to him.
[5352.22 → 5353.80] The skepticism
[5353.80 → 5354.90] and the questioning
[5354.90 → 5356.66] is okay.
[5357.40 → 5357.78] In fact,
[5358.06 → 5359.44] I think that
[5359.44 → 5360.60] part of what
[5360.60 → 5362.02] is going on here,
[5362.58 → 5362.84] right,
[5362.92 → 5364.48] is an echo
[5364.48 → 5365.98] or a continuation
[5365.98 → 5367.24] of the question,
[5367.60 → 5368.24] who are you
[5368.24 → 5369.24] and who sent you,
[5369.54 → 5370.46] that started
[5370.46 → 5371.16] and that we have
[5371.16 → 5371.78] modelled for us
[5371.78 → 5372.72] in Matthew 16.
[5372.90 → 5373.52] If you have your Bible
[5373.52 → 5373.80] open,
[5373.80 → 5374.48] it's worth flipping
[5374.48 → 5376.42] over to chapter 16.
[5378.72 → 5379.80] Chapter 16,
[5380.66 → 5382.62] I'll start at verse 13.
[5383.72 → 5384.54] We can read
[5384.54 → 5385.32] that
[5385.32 → 5387.18] when Jesus came
[5387.18 → 5387.86] to the region
[5387.86 → 5389.28] of Caesarea Philippi,
[5389.40 → 5390.46] he asked his disciples,
[5390.88 → 5392.12] who do people say
[5392.12 → 5393.36] the Son of Man is?
[5393.98 → 5395.02] And they replied,
[5395.26 → 5396.58] some say John the Baptist,
[5396.76 → 5397.60] others say Elijah,
[5397.72 → 5398.46] and still others,
[5398.90 → 5399.22] Jeremiah,
[5399.52 → 5400.40] or one of the prophets.
[5400.40 → 5402.42] But what about you,
[5402.86 → 5403.44] he asked?
[5403.72 → 5405.00] Who do you say
[5405.00 → 5406.26] that I am?
[5407.54 → 5408.86] Simon Peter answered,
[5409.62 → 5412.32] you are the Messiah,
[5413.00 → 5416.62] the Son of the living God.
[5419.64 → 5423.62] Questions shape faith.
[5425.26 → 5426.90] Skepticism becomes
[5426.90 → 5428.42] the context wherein
[5428.42 → 5429.58] you can make
[5429.58 → 5430.60] the declaration,
[5431.06 → 5432.62] you are the Messiah,
[5433.04 → 5435.46] the Son of the living God.
[5436.28 → 5437.42] Questions like that
[5437.42 → 5438.42] are necessary
[5438.42 → 5439.82] for who we are
[5439.82 → 5442.34] and I, for one,
[5442.72 → 5446.68] will never shy away
[5446.68 → 5449.64] from your hard questions.
[5450.52 → 5451.28] Now the reality is
[5451.28 → 5451.80] I won't know
[5451.80 → 5452.72] all the answers to them,
[5453.86 → 5455.30] but my commitment with you
[5455.30 → 5456.00] is to journey,
[5456.66 → 5457.44] to figure it out,
[5457.44 → 5458.54] to wrestle.
[5459.54 → 5460.66] The problem isn't
[5460.66 → 5462.50] the asking of the questions.
[5464.56 → 5465.36] The problem
[5465.36 → 5466.98] is the refusal
[5466.98 → 5468.32] to commit to an answer.
[5469.36 → 5470.26] That's what happens
[5470.26 → 5471.34] in our text.
[5472.82 → 5473.66] If we go back
[5473.66 → 5475.14] to chapter 21,
[5476.18 → 5477.54] they ask this question
[5477.54 → 5478.62] and Jesus says,
[5478.76 → 5478.98] okay,
[5479.14 → 5480.28] let me follow up to you
[5480.28 → 5481.06] with a question.
[5481.54 → 5482.56] And then they discuss it
[5482.56 → 5483.30] among themselves
[5483.30 → 5483.78] and they say,
[5483.84 → 5484.72] well, if we say this,
[5484.78 → 5485.56] then he's going to say this
[5485.56 → 5486.34] and if we say this,
[5486.58 → 5487.72] then he's going to say this.
[5487.94 → 5488.64] And so they say,
[5488.82 → 5489.56] I don't know.
[5490.78 → 5491.60] I don't know.
[5493.36 → 5494.14] And Jesus says,
[5494.22 → 5494.38] well,
[5495.46 → 5497.76] then I'm not going to tell you.
[5497.76 → 5500.98] The problem
[5500.98 → 5502.74] isn't that they have questions.
[5502.98 → 5504.14] The problem here
[5504.14 → 5505.22] is that they refuse
[5505.22 → 5506.40] to commit to an answer.
[5507.04 → 5507.92] And I think,
[5508.14 → 5509.26] as we have been seeing
[5509.26 → 5509.64] throughout,
[5510.00 → 5510.80] the problem is
[5510.80 → 5511.74] that they should have
[5511.74 → 5512.98] already known the answer.
[5513.64 → 5514.30] They don't actually
[5514.30 → 5515.10] have an excuse
[5515.10 → 5516.16] because as Matthew
[5516.16 → 5517.56] has been painstakingly showing,
[5517.90 → 5518.84] Jesus has been making
[5518.84 → 5519.34] this point
[5519.34 → 5520.52] over and over
[5520.52 → 5521.30] and over again
[5521.30 → 5522.38] about who he is.
[5522.38 → 5526.76] And I think
[5526.76 → 5528.06] the same remains
[5528.06 → 5529.88] true for us.
[5531.74 → 5533.08] In our culture,
[5533.22 → 5534.12] especially here
[5534.12 → 5535.06] in the West,
[5535.30 → 5536.86] especially as we
[5536.86 → 5537.60] have been shaped,
[5537.82 → 5539.62] there is no
[5539.62 → 5542.86] real excuse
[5542.86 → 5544.76] for not knowing
[5544.76 → 5546.68] who Jesus is
[5546.68 → 5547.76] in our culture.
[5547.76 → 5551.44] except
[5551.44 → 5553.36] for wilful
[5553.36 → 5554.34] ignorance.
[5557.56 → 5558.32] And let me be
[5558.32 → 5558.80] really clear
[5558.80 → 5559.68] with what I say next.
[5561.20 → 5562.50] Because the only excuse
[5562.50 → 5563.04] for not knowing
[5563.04 → 5563.90] Jesus in our culture
[5563.90 → 5564.96] is not the wilful
[5564.96 → 5565.44] ignorance
[5565.44 → 5566.54] of people
[5566.54 → 5567.64] outside the church.
[5569.20 → 5570.18] It's the wilful
[5570.18 → 5570.66] ignorance
[5570.66 → 5571.92] of us
[5571.92 → 5573.58] who sit here
[5573.58 → 5575.54] and who refuse
[5575.54 → 5576.06] to go
[5576.06 → 5576.94] and to declare
[5576.94 → 5577.94] and to proclaim
[5577.94 → 5579.06] to our neighbours
[5579.06 → 5580.66] who this Jesus is.
[5580.74 → 5581.28] It's us.
[5581.74 → 5582.86] And there's a
[5583.34 → 5585.02] this is a loaded word,
[5585.12 → 5585.70] but I'll say it anyway,
[5585.76 → 5586.54] there's a pandemic
[5586.54 → 5588.32] of biblical illiteracy
[5588.32 → 5589.24] in the church today.
[5590.98 → 5592.94] And our wilful ignorance
[5592.94 → 5593.90] is creating
[5593.90 → 5594.72] this problem
[5594.72 → 5595.64] where people
[5595.64 → 5596.64] can't answer
[5596.64 → 5597.18] the question
[5597.18 → 5597.92] who is Jesus
[5597.92 → 5598.88] because they don't
[5598.88 → 5599.46] actually want to go
[5599.46 → 5600.30] talk to the Christians
[5600.30 → 5601.04] because the Christians
[5601.04 → 5601.48] have made it
[5601.48 → 5602.38] about something else.
[5603.04 → 5603.78] Remember when our power
[5603.78 → 5604.32] and our privilege
[5604.32 → 5604.96] are challenged?
[5605.96 → 5606.56] Remember when we have
[5606.56 → 5606.96] a value
[5606.96 → 5607.72] that we raise up
[5607.72 → 5608.64] to go against the flow
[5608.64 → 5609.52] and make other decisions?
[5610.64 → 5611.64] Is that value
[5611.64 → 5612.68] that you've raised up
[5612.68 → 5613.08] Jesus?
[5614.56 → 5615.20] Is that,
[5615.26 → 5616.04] that value
[5616.04 → 5617.26] that you've put up
[5617.26 → 5617.48] the
[5617.48 → 5618.46] the proclamation
[5618.46 → 5619.36] of the kingdom come
[5619.36 → 5620.16] and the kingdom coming
[5620.16 → 5620.98] of living a life
[5620.98 → 5621.80] worthy of the calling
[5621.80 → 5622.54] that you have received
[5622.54 → 5623.40] in grace?
[5625.00 → 5626.24] Or is it something else
[5626.24 → 5628.80] that's getting in the way
[5628.80 → 5630.26] of people hearing
[5630.26 → 5632.54] who this man is?
[5633.54 → 5634.18] Because you see,
[5634.24 → 5635.44] there's one more response
[5635.44 → 5637.14] and that good questions
[5637.14 → 5638.08] will lead us to.
[5638.90 → 5640.08] And that final response
[5640.08 → 5641.50] comes in the story
[5641.50 → 5642.54] of Jesus cursing
[5642.54 → 5643.08] the fig tree.
[5643.16 → 5643.96] And I just want to say
[5643.96 → 5645.16] this is a weird story.
[5646.40 → 5647.28] But hear this.
[5648.28 → 5649.18] Verse 18.
[5650.02 → 5651.64] So Jesus has entered
[5651.64 → 5653.16] Jerusalem in the triumphal entry.
[5653.28 → 5654.42] He has cleared the temple
[5654.42 → 5655.52] and then they went
[5655.52 → 5656.48] to Bethany
[5656.48 → 5657.16] to spend the night.
[5657.28 → 5658.18] Early in the morning,
[5658.30 → 5658.96] verse 18,
[5659.10 → 5660.28] as Jesus was on his way
[5660.28 → 5661.00] back to the city,
[5661.08 → 5661.72] he was hungry
[5661.72 → 5663.26] and seeing a fig tree
[5663.26 → 5663.90] by the road,
[5663.98 → 5664.76] he went up to it
[5664.76 → 5666.14] but found nothing on it
[5666.14 → 5666.92] except leaves
[5666.92 → 5668.24] and then he said to it,
[5668.48 → 5670.36] may you never bear fruit again
[5670.36 → 5671.28] and immediately
[5671.28 → 5672.92] the tree withered.
[5675.08 → 5675.34] Now,
[5676.28 → 5677.38] can I just say
[5677.38 → 5678.00] that the history
[5678.00 → 5678.66] of interpretation
[5678.66 → 5679.66] on this passage
[5679.66 → 5680.64] is convoluted
[5680.64 → 5681.80] and it is really fun
[5681.80 → 5682.62] to wrestle into
[5682.62 → 5684.04] and someone like Josh
[5684.04 → 5684.94] and maybe Bert
[5684.94 → 5685.60] or Peter
[5685.60 → 5686.40] really want to dig
[5686.40 → 5687.30] into that kind of thing.
[5687.50 → 5688.78] But for our purposes here,
[5688.78 → 5691.08] just here,
[5691.92 → 5692.16] right,
[5692.24 → 5694.40] that Jesus spoke
[5694.40 → 5696.66] and immediately
[5696.66 → 5697.42] the tree withered.
[5698.50 → 5699.86] And the disciples say,
[5700.40 → 5701.12] when the disciples
[5701.12 → 5701.94] saw this,
[5702.10 → 5704.32] they were amazed.
[5705.70 → 5706.88] How did the tree
[5706.88 → 5708.90] wither so quickly,
[5709.08 → 5709.74] they asked.
[5710.32 → 5711.16] Which is, again,
[5711.24 → 5712.08] another way of asking
[5712.08 → 5712.54] the question,
[5712.88 → 5714.98] who is this man?
[5717.08 → 5718.04] Now, I think,
[5718.04 → 5719.42] in this story,
[5719.58 → 5721.76] there is a direct echo
[5721.76 → 5722.82] or parallel
[5722.82 → 5724.84] to a similar story
[5724.84 → 5726.48] that's told in Matthew 8,
[5726.62 → 5727.66] verse 27.
[5728.54 → 5731.18] Jesus is asleep on a boat
[5731.18 → 5732.92] and a storm rises up
[5732.92 → 5734.10] and the disciples
[5734.10 → 5734.78] are terrified
[5734.78 → 5735.72] for their life
[5735.72 → 5737.20] and so they wake Master up
[5737.20 → 5737.66] and they say,
[5737.74 → 5738.00] Master,
[5738.10 → 5738.62] don't you care
[5738.62 → 5739.76] that we are about to die?
[5740.08 → 5740.96] And Jesus says,
[5741.20 → 5742.86] what is your faith in?
[5744.22 → 5745.56] And he speaks up
[5745.56 → 5746.66] and he stands up
[5746.66 → 5747.26] and he speaks,
[5747.26 → 5747.80] he says,
[5747.88 → 5748.48] be still
[5748.48 → 5749.50] and immediately
[5749.50 → 5751.54] the storm dies.
[5751.62 → 5752.22] And we are told
[5752.22 → 5753.26] in chapter 8,
[5753.32 → 5753.96] verse 27,
[5754.46 → 5756.70] the men were amazed
[5756.70 → 5758.26] and they asked,
[5758.50 → 5760.16] what kind of man is this?
[5760.52 → 5761.42] Even the winds
[5761.42 → 5762.12] and the waves
[5762.12 → 5763.08] obey him.
[5764.16 → 5766.66] Who is this Jesus?
[5766.92 → 5768.40] What kind of man is this?
[5768.48 → 5769.16] Even the wind
[5769.16 → 5769.78] and the waves
[5769.78 → 5770.60] and the trees
[5770.60 → 5771.66] obey him.
[5771.66 → 5773.72] they are amazed
[5773.72 → 5774.96] that the response
[5774.96 → 5777.42] to the question,
[5777.58 → 5778.92] who is Jesus,
[5779.52 → 5780.98] rightly leads
[5780.98 → 5782.64] to worship,
[5783.64 → 5784.86] to being amazed.
[5786.32 → 5787.12] And so if you're here
[5787.12 → 5787.72] this morning
[5787.72 → 5790.98] and maybe for the first time
[5790.98 → 5792.68] you're starting to answer
[5792.68 → 5793.22] the question,
[5793.36 → 5794.84] who is Jesus for you?
[5795.58 → 5795.86] Right?
[5795.86 → 5796.90] Maybe for the first time
[5796.90 → 5797.74] you're starting to wonder,
[5797.74 → 5798.30] yeah,
[5798.40 → 5798.80] you know what?
[5798.84 → 5799.48] This actually
[5799.48 → 5801.10] does change
[5801.10 → 5802.08] things
[5802.08 → 5802.94] for me.
[5804.10 → 5805.24] But I want to talk to you
[5805.24 → 5806.34] about profession of faith
[5806.34 → 5807.14] or I want to talk to you
[5807.14 → 5807.96] about baptism,
[5808.44 → 5808.54] right?
[5808.58 → 5810.02] About standing up
[5810.02 → 5810.50] and saying,
[5810.66 → 5811.80] this I believe
[5811.80 → 5813.90] in Jesus Christ.
[5814.68 → 5816.52] He is the King
[5816.52 → 5818.00] and Messiah.
[5818.00 → 5820.42] because this
[5820.42 → 5821.98] is the most
[5821.98 → 5823.08] important decision
[5823.08 → 5825.48] you will ever
[5825.48 → 5826.64] make.
[5827.36 → 5828.12] Who
[5828.12 → 5829.38] is
[5829.38 → 5830.56] Jesus?
[5831.88 → 5833.00] And I hope,
[5833.24 → 5833.72] I hope
[5833.72 → 5834.36] and I pray
[5834.36 → 5835.60] that as we wave
[5835.60 → 5836.32] palm branches
[5836.32 → 5839.12] that you will see
[5839.12 → 5839.90] that he
[5839.90 → 5841.02] is
[5841.02 → 5842.08] your
[5842.08 → 5843.20] Messiah
[5843.20 → 5844.32] King.
[5844.74 → 5845.02] Amen?
[5845.82 → 5846.50] Amen.
[5846.66 → 5847.32] Let's pray together.
[5848.00 → 5848.64] And actually,
[5848.68 → 5849.20] I'm going to invite you
[5849.20 → 5849.78] to stand
[5849.78 → 5850.54] for this prayer.
[5850.64 → 5851.36] That seems appropriate.
[5851.46 → 5851.98] If you're able,
[5852.18 → 5853.06] please stand.
[5858.74 → 5859.34] Holy
[5859.34 → 5860.34] Lord
[5860.34 → 5861.40] Jesus.
[5862.44 → 5863.08] Holy
[5863.08 → 5864.10] Messiah
[5864.10 → 5865.16] King
[5865.16 → 5866.08] Jesus.
[5867.84 → 5869.20] We stand
[5869.20 → 5869.92] here
[5869.92 → 5870.92] in your
[5870.92 → 5871.62] presence.
[5871.80 → 5872.38] We stand
[5872.38 → 5872.88] here
[5872.88 → 5873.80] amazed
[5873.80 → 5874.48] at whom
[5874.48 → 5875.28] you are.
[5875.60 → 5876.20] We stand
[5876.20 → 5876.50] here,
[5876.56 → 5877.14] each one
[5877.14 → 5877.52] of us
[5877.52 → 5878.24] on a
[5878.24 → 5878.62] different
[5878.62 → 5879.08] journey
[5879.08 → 5879.78] of faith
[5879.78 → 5880.26] and
[5880.26 → 5880.88] proclamation,
[5881.38 → 5881.92] an answer
[5881.92 → 5882.26] to the
[5882.26 → 5882.64] question,
[5882.84 → 5883.08] who
[5883.08 → 5884.08] is
[5884.08 → 5884.86] Jesus?
[5886.38 → 5886.78] And so,
[5886.86 → 5886.96] God,
[5887.00 → 5887.62] I pray for
[5887.62 → 5888.22] those who
[5888.22 → 5889.44] are in
[5889.44 → 5890.34] indignation
[5890.34 → 5890.78] pushing
[5890.78 → 5891.42] against
[5891.42 → 5891.90] you.
[5893.08 → 5893.84] I pray
[5893.84 → 5894.34] for those
[5894.34 → 5894.74] of us
[5894.74 → 5895.06] who have
[5895.06 → 5895.72] questions
[5895.72 → 5896.36] and are
[5896.36 → 5896.96] skeptics
[5896.96 → 5897.20] and are
[5897.20 → 5897.68] full of
[5897.68 → 5898.08] doubt
[5898.08 → 5899.16] and trial
[5899.16 → 5899.86] and are
[5899.86 → 5900.38] struggling
[5900.38 → 5901.06] to understand.
[5901.20 → 5901.52] May we
[5901.52 → 5902.26] bring those
[5902.26 → 5902.80] to you,
[5902.96 → 5903.12] Lord
[5903.12 → 5903.82] Jesus.
[5905.58 → 5905.92] And I
[5905.92 → 5906.16] pray,
[5906.38 → 5906.60] God,
[5906.66 → 5907.22] for those
[5907.22 → 5908.24] who maybe
[5908.24 → 5908.92] today for
[5908.92 → 5909.36] the first
[5909.36 → 5910.22] time or
[5910.22 → 5910.96] who today
[5910.96 → 5912.42] affirm in
[5912.42 → 5913.40] their faith
[5913.40 → 5914.18] that you
[5914.18 → 5915.68] are my
[5915.68 → 5916.38] King,
[5916.72 → 5917.66] that you,
[5917.90 → 5918.32] Lord Jesus,
[5918.46 → 5918.94] belong on
[5918.94 → 5919.44] the throne
[5919.44 → 5920.30] of my
[5920.30 → 5921.02] heart,
[5921.20 → 5921.96] and so I
[5921.96 → 5922.88] will worship
[5922.88 → 5923.60] you
[5923.60 → 5924.52] forever.
[5926.64 → 5927.70] May we
[5927.70 → 5928.84] add our
[5928.84 → 5929.84] voices to
[5929.84 → 5930.76] the voices
[5930.76 → 5931.64] of the
[5931.64 → 5932.00] church
[5932.00 → 5932.48] throughout
[5932.48 → 5933.34] time
[5933.34 → 5934.34] immemorial

[5935.00 → 5935.66] you,
[5936.04 → 5936.82] Lord Jesus,
[5937.08 → 5938.14] as our
[5938.14 → 5938.86] King.

[6111.72 → 6114.74] Know that you go with the blessing of God
[6114.74 → 6116.78] And go also with this invitation
[6116.78 → 6120.14] Take those palm branches that you have received
[6120.14 → 6121.72] And they're stacked still by the door
[6121.72 → 6123.28] So take more as you go
[6123.28 → 6126.04] And consider how you might
[6126.04 → 6129.16] Display them in your home
[6129.16 → 6130.92] Or prominently on your door
[6130.92 → 6133.04] Fashion them into a wreath if you like
[6133.04 → 6134.62] Which is very traditional practice
[6134.62 → 6136.22] And hang them there
[6136.22 → 6138.50] For the world to see
[6138.50 → 6140.10] That this week
[6140.10 → 6142.90] You are journeying with Jesus to the cross
[6142.90 → 6145.62] And that on Friday as we gather and remember
[6145.62 → 6148.96] We do so in the hope of Sunday to come
[6148.96 → 6151.52] That the tomb is empty
[6151.52 → 6155.52] And, so please take some palm branches with you as you go
[6155.52 → 6157.18] And then lastly
[6157.18 → 6160.18] If you are able or interested in
