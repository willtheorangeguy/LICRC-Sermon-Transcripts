[26.50 → 32.40] Jesus sought me when a stranger
[32.40 → 37.56] wandering from the fold of God.

[239.96 → 255.16] You traded riches
[255.16 → 260.50] To run to my rescue
[260.50 → 264.98] Oh, my Redeemer
[264.98 → 269.46] You take the pieces
[269.46 → 274.86] And turn them to praises

[827.10 → 857.08] Everything I need.
[857.10 → 887.08] Everything I need.
[887.08 → 890.62] Good morning.
[892.24 → 894.88] Welcome to worship.
[895.16 → 897.32] Welcome to Langley Emanuel Church.
[897.42 → 900.84] A special welcome if you are a guest with us this morning.
[901.26 → 906.14] We are in the midst of the full-on lived experience of summer.
[906.96 → 916.52] And, so thank you for being here, especially if you're a guest to participate in and witness the profession of faith from three of our members later in our service.
[916.52 → 921.48] We're excited to have you all here together and worship our God.
[921.54 → 924.48] Before we begin, we have a couple announcements to make.
[924.48 → 937.30] First, after service today, if you are interested, I will be leading a recap discussion on the events and decisions of Synod 2024.
[937.30 → 942.34] Synod is the bi-national gathering of leaders from the Christian Reformed Church.
[942.34 → 944.32] It happened a couple of weeks ago.
[944.32 → 953.90] And there are some decisions that are made and coming out of that, some impacts for our life and shared ministry as Christian Reformed Churches.
[953.90 → 961.16] And so after service, about 15 minutes after we end, so you'll have time to grab a coffee and chat with some people.
[961.28 → 963.08] But then we'll meet in the multipurpose room.
[963.46 → 968.54] And then I'll walk you through what my experience as a delegate this year was like.
[968.54 → 980.32] Additionally, the deacons are working on putting together and hosting our annual summer food drive.
[980.90 → 988.04] And so the way this is facilitated is that we have grocery bags donated from different local grocery chains.
[988.04 → 991.24] And we put a little tag on them, a flyer on them.
[991.24 → 1002.68] And then on July 7, groups of people will canvas the neighbourhood, giving out those bags with the instructions on when to return them full of groceries.
[1003.46 → 1012.48] And so we're looking for people to help on July 7th to hand out those bags and different routes through the neighbourhood around our church.
[1012.48 → 1028.68] And then to help on July 13th, when we're going to host a bit of a family fun day and festival, a pancake breakfast, and an opportunity to drop those bags off full of groceries so that we can then bring them to the Langley Food Bank.
[1029.30 → 1037.86] One of the things we know during the summer, donations to the food bank drop precipitously, but need goes up.
[1037.86 → 1041.74] Because kids aren't receiving food programs at school and the like.
[1042.26 → 1045.54] And so they're at home more and then need more food at home.
[1046.28 → 1051.76] And so it creates a bit of a hard time for the food bank because their need goes up, but their donations go down.
[1051.82 → 1055.02] And so we want to try to fill a gap for them in this way.
[1055.02 → 1065.02] And so please, there will be a deacon, I think it'll be Brenda, at the Connect booth after service to get details about how you can help and sign up and participate in that.
[1065.02 → 1072.16] And there's also a sign-up in the e-bulletin that goes out every week for you to get involved in that.
[1073.14 → 1082.60] And lastly, we are also looking for a new children's worship time coordinator to take up that role when we start again in September.
[1083.62 → 1087.92] And so if that's something you might be interested in, you can talk to Pastor Kevin or to myself.
[1088.56 → 1092.28] We'd happily share what that is like and what's involved there.
[1092.28 → 1095.84] That's a great opportunity to serve with a team of people.
[1096.18 → 1101.64] And so if you and a couple friends want to take that on, that's a great time and way to serve in our community there.
[1102.52 → 1103.68] I think that's it for announcements.
[1103.82 → 1103.96] Yeah?
[1104.38 → 1104.70] Good.
[1105.30 → 1106.40] Kevin gives me the thumbs up.
[1106.46 → 1107.34] That means it must be so.
[1107.90 → 1113.44] I'm going to invite you, as you are able, to stand, and we can be ushered into God's presence together.
[1113.44 → 1124.64] Father, we come into this place because God has called us, and he meets us here, and we mark God's presence by receiving his greeting.
[1124.98 → 1130.42] But God not only comes to us from this stage down, but also in the midst of his body.
[1130.42 → 1138.98] And so after I give you God's greeting, I invite you to turn to those around you and to welcome them into worship by passing the peace of Christ,
[1139.06 → 1141.80] saying the peace of Christ be with you or saying the Lord be with you.
[1141.98 → 1145.50] And we mark God's presence in our midst in that way as well.
[1145.84 → 1147.64] Receive the greeting of our God.
[1148.76 → 1156.12] Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, Son and our Saviour,
[1156.12 → 1158.96] through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[1159.96 → 1160.28] Amen.
[1160.42 → 1160.72] Amen.
[1190.42 → 1201.94] Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 89.
[1201.94 → 1206.34] I will sing of the Lord's great love forever.
[1206.60 → 1212.58] With my mouth, I will make your faithfulness known through all generations.
[1212.58 → 1221.28] I will declare that your love stands firm forever, that you have established your faithfulness in heaven itself.
[1223.00 → 1224.24] Let's open with prayer.
[1224.24 → 1229.34] Father, Father, open our eyes to see your faithfulness throughout our lives.
[1229.52 → 1233.24] As we worship this morning, help us to sing of your great love and faithfulness.
[1233.66 → 1234.94] We long to worship you.
[1235.44 → 1235.76] Amen.
[1235.76 → 1235.92] Amen.
[1265.76 → 1280.28] runs dry. Drink of the water, come and thirst no more. Come all you sinners, come find his
[1280.28 → 1290.54] mercy. Come to the table, he will satisfy. Taste of his goodness, find what you're looking
[1290.54 → 1306.90] for. For God so loved the world, he gave us his one and only son to save us. Whoever believes
[1306.90 → 1320.52] in him will live forever. Bring all your failures, bring your addictions, come lay them down.
[1320.54 → 1336.00] Down at the foot of the cross, Jesus is waiting there with open arms. For God so loved the world
[1336.00 → 1347.50] that he gave us, his one and only son to save us. Whoever believes in him will live forever.
[1350.54 → 1362.50] The power of hell, forever defeated, now it is well. I'm walking in freedom for God so loved,
[1362.88 → 1369.54] God so loved the world. Praise God, praise God, from whom all blessings flow. Praise him,

[1417.54 → 1424.54] Whoever believes in him will live forever.

[1494.02 → 1496.54] I love you, Lord.
[1497.54 → 1497.74] God so loved you, Lord.
[1497.74 → 1501.54] Oh, your mercy never fails me.
[1501.54 → 1503.54] God so loved you, Lord.
[1503.54 → 1506.54] God so loved me Theatre вещи in Christ, Terre Haute,
[1506.54 → 1509.54] God so loved you.
[1509.54 → 1511.82] your mercy never failed me.
[1511.82 → 1515.54] All my days I have been held in your hands.

[2100.00 → 2103.52] hello everyone my name is Casey van helmet and I believe
[2107.60 → 2112.08] I'm standing up here today confidently being able to say that Jesus really died on the cross to
[2112.08 → 2116.64] forgive our sins that he really rose from the grave three days later and that he really is my saviour
[2116.64 → 2122.96] my king my rescuer and my hero I believe this through I believe this through true and genuine
[2122.96 → 2128.64] faith I've spent my entire life in the Christian reform community in my childhood I was brought and
[2128.64 → 2135.44] sometimes even dragged to church every Sunday I attended an awesome Christian school LCS and I even
[2135.44 → 2139.68] watched hours of veggie tales which helped me learn about the classic stories of the bible
[2139.68 → 2146.40] as a young lad I became numb to it all I was getting bored with Christianity I sang the same
[2146.40 → 2150.80] songs during church services and school chapels every week and I already heard stories like Noah
[2150.80 → 2157.12] and the whale David versus Goliath and Jesus feeding the 5 000 about a million times so I wondered why would
[2157.12 → 2164.00] I need to hear them again then I grew up a little bit of god has constantly worked for me and has revealed
[2164.00 → 2168.96] himself to me my whole life but i only really started to notice this throughout high school I started to
[2168.96 → 2174.88] realize that all these things have been learning about all this time were miraculously true I should
[2174.88 → 2180.72] and I should glorify him because of this truth god has given me loads of opportunities to do
[2180.72 → 2186.40] this in recent years I've been able to lead at a super fun summer camp go on some amazing service
[2186.40 → 2192.00] trips and attend some pretty sweet youth conferences these have been these have become really cool memories
[2192.00 → 2196.72] where god has worked in me and through me to spread the joy of Jesus to others so that they may also
[2196.72 → 2201.36] experience the greatness of him I've been able to learn tons about what it means to live for Jesus
[2201.36 → 2207.12] and love like him too god has also provided me with some of the greatest family friends youth groups
[2207.12 → 2211.92] teachers and teammates I could ever ask for I know he has surrounded me with incredible people for a
[2211.92 → 2216.40] reason so that we may spread his joy and love to others in the world who do not know the good news yet
[2217.12 → 2222.40] god has an amazing purpose god has an amazing purpose for my family my friends this church our
[2222.40 → 2228.32] community and even me I'm convinced that Jesus is the messiah so I want to hand my life over to him
[2228.32 → 2232.72] I want to spend my life doing his works on earth and spreading the incredible news of Jesus to the
[2232.72 → 2237.20] world to end my profession of faith I want to read a verse that really stood out to me while writing
[2237.20 → 2242.64] this it is from Ephesians 2 verse 8 which says for it is by grace you have been saved through faith
[2242.64 → 2247.84] and this is not from yourselves it is the gift of god we are given grace through faith and because of
[2247.84 → 2262.24] my faith I want to live my life to glorify god so Casey has asked his older brother Ryan to come up
[2262.24 → 2267.36] and speak on his behalf but Ryan lives in Ontario and so what Ryan has done is made a little video
[2268.08 → 2271.20] and that's going to come on the screen right now that you get to watch from up here hi everyone
[2271.92 → 2278.16] if you don't know me I'm Ryan and I'm Casey's older brother unfortunately I'm unable to be in
[2278.16 → 2282.88] person today but I'm still extremely excited and happy to be able to share a couple of words of
[2282.88 → 2289.36] encouragement for Casey's profession of faith Casey's love for Jesus shows in everything that he does
[2290.08 → 2294.40] his care for others and his sense of community have always stood out but I think that they've grown
[2295.36 → 2300.72] more prominent in the last couple of years here while it's been a little bit since I've gone on the
[2300.72 → 2305.92] service trip with Casey I have had the opportunity to go on a couple with him, I think that these
[2305.92 → 2314.08] trips have really shaped his faith with these trips I've seen him grow in the sense that he is
[2314.08 → 2319.20] always willing to give a helping hand he's always there to encourage and celebrate others for their
[2319.20 → 2326.88] achievements, and he's very slow to judge but very quick to love I've seen this both as a
[2326.88 → 2332.80] brother I've seen this as a friend I've also seen this um just in the random people that he interacts
[2332.80 → 2341.52] with on a day-to-day basis these are all clear examples of the love of Jesus in his life in the
[2341.52 → 2346.72] next year Casey's going to meet a lot of new people whether they're fellow students fellow teammates
[2347.52 → 2354.16] players on opposing teams professors or the many little random interactions that he has throughout the
[2354.16 → 2360.48] day I hope Casey that you are able to continue reflecting Christ's love in all of these
[2360.48 → 2366.80] interactions and I know that you'll be able to do so congratulations on this huge step in your
[2366.80 → 2372.88] faith journey i and all the other people in your life and in this church congregation are really proud
[2372.88 → 2380.40] of you and really happy for you, I'm extremely excited to see how your faith continues in your life
[2380.40 → 2383.20] over these next couple years and forever
[2386.88 → 2388.80] thanks Ryan he's watching online he said
[2393.44 → 2395.20] all right which one of you two wants to go next
[2402.08 → 2407.60] hi everyone my name is maddened um I just graduated from laying the Christian I did pastor's class last
[2407.60 → 2412.72] year and when the time came to decide whether I do my profession of faith I decided not to but i
[2412.72 → 2418.40] wasn't really sure why um I talked to Kevin about it a bit and I came to the conclusion that even though
[2418.40 → 2422.32] I've grown up in this church and in a Christian home and never really had any like life-altering
[2422.32 → 2427.04] struggles that like rocked my faith it was because I still had lots of questions and doubts and that was
[2427.04 → 2432.96] okay although that is still true this past year has been one where my relationship with Christ has really
[2432.96 → 2437.52] grown and looking back I'm realizing that my understanding of what I'm professing has improved so
[2437.60 → 2444.40] much that I feel fully confident in my decision now uh shoot and I can see god's hand in my
[2444.40 → 2449.12] decision of waiting until this year I think a lot of Christians struggle with not having a finding
[2449.12 → 2453.60] moment in their walks of faith but all that means to me is that god has been defining and shaping my
[2453.60 → 2458.88] life from the beginning of course I've had struggles and moments when my faith was weaker but he has never
[2458.88 → 2463.44] left me and looking back it's so obvious my testimony shows god's faithfulness in my life
[2463.44 → 2467.36] this past year of high school the small moments when the best people have supported me or the
[2467.36 → 2472.00] right words were said at the right moment or whatever else I could see him working I went on
[2472.00 → 2476.56] an outreach trip to New York with the school in the spring, and it was incredibly transformative i
[2476.56 → 2480.48] bonded with so many of the kids there and really experienced a much more different lifestyle than i
[2480.48 → 2485.44] could have imagined I saw god everywhere even in the most heartbreaking parts and that completely
[2485.44 → 2490.32] changed my perspective to one of gratitude for my life and appreciation for the ways he is working in
[2490.32 → 2495.28] lives around the world sports have also always been a big part of my life and the people god
[2495.28 → 2499.44] surround me with through that the big exciting moments and the hard lessons I've experienced
[2499.44 → 2504.24] and the injuries I've had have all taught me more about Jesus and helped shape me not only that looking
[2504.24 → 2509.36] towards a different life without sports I've learned a lot about myself and who god is and how he works
[2510.16 → 2515.76] what Jesus has done in my life is amazing and moving on to the next chapter of my life I want to fully
[2515.76 → 2521.12] accept that and dedicate myself to him, it's exciting to be moving on to university next year and I want
[2521.12 → 2526.32] to do it in the way that he wants me to he sacrificed himself for me so I could stand here today and fully
[2526.32 → 2532.00] accept him into my life, but blessed is the one who trusts in the lord whose confidence is in him
[2532.64 → 2537.52] they will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream it does not fear
[2537.52 → 2542.88] when heat comes its leaves are always green it has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit
[2542.88 → 2548.96] uh that's from Jeremiah 17 verse 7 to 8 and this is a verse that I recently read, and it's become one
[2548.96 → 2552.80] that I keep going back to because I think it describes what my life with Jesus should look like
[2552.80 → 2557.76] going forward if I trust in him and stay firmly rooted in him and with Jesus's help I'm going to
[2557.76 → 2561.36] do my best to live it out thank you
[2561.36 → 2573.36] so maddens uh spiritual mentor she asked uh Savannah Mueller to come and speak on her path
[2573.36 → 2578.40] but sadly Savannah can't be here today either but Savannah has written something and so while I'm
[2578.40 → 2586.56] reading this just picture like Savannah instead of me all right so Savannah says I have been maddens
[2586.56 → 2591.28] youth leader since she started high school right from the start I could tell that she was a thinker
[2591.28 → 2596.48] over the years I've seen madden willing to open up and share her thoughts and contribute to discussions
[2597.36 → 2602.24] in large groups she's been an example to other youth committed to being there and excited to learn
[2602.24 → 2607.84] in small group when put on the spot she doesn't shy away from sharing madden is confident in who she
[2607.84 → 2613.20] is and what she believes she has a strong knowledge of the bible which has shaped her it has been a
[2613.20 → 2618.48] blessing to get to know you madden and I'm excited savannah's excited I'm excited to witness
[2618.48 → 2623.84] you do this online she's watching right now that's what that means uh she's excited to see you take
[2623.84 → 2628.88] this important step in your faith my encouragement for you is to continue to learn and grow from his
[2628.88 → 2635.60] word make time for him in prayer and trust god in wherever he leads you keep Jesus as a priority in
[2635.60 → 2640.80] your life at the centre of all you do, and he will keep his promise to hold you steadfast I'll leave
[2640.80 → 2646.48] you with this passage from Ephesians 3 16 to 19 I pray that out of his glorious riches he may
[2646.48 → 2651.28] strengthen you with power through his spirit in your inner being so that Christ may dwell in your
[2651.28 → 2657.04] hearts through faith and I pray that you being rooted and established in love may have power together
[2657.04 → 2663.44] with all the lord's holy people to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ and
[2663.44 → 2668.88] to know this love that surpasses knowledge that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of god
[2668.88 → 2670.56] thanks Savannah
[2675.20 → 2677.20] all right and now I'm going to invite allay up front
[2680.80 → 2684.64] hello my name is ally and I would like to share a bit of my testimony with you today
[2685.36 → 2689.44] I got to grow up in a home where we prayed before every meal we read the bible after dinner, and we went
[2689.44 → 2694.48] to church every Sunday I always knew that god was the reason that we did those things that he died on
[2694.48 → 2700.08] the cross for our sins, and we praise him for that but I never let that be my reason for me, I often let
[2700.08 → 2704.88] other things get in the way and I struggled to see god through it and I didn't let him be my reason
[2705.76 → 2710.96] I am someone who loves timelines if you give me a schedule I'll follow it but in life we don't really
[2710.96 → 2717.12] get one of those Jesus doesn't give us a monthly planner that we can follow um but I have learned that
[2717.12 → 2721.76] I've learned I've learned over the past year that it's okay to not know what's happening because god does and
[2721.76 → 2726.24] he's in control that used to be such an empty statement to me just something youth leaders
[2726.24 → 2730.80] would tell you when you were in a stressful situation, but now it speaks a lot of truth
[2731.76 → 2736.24] at the end of the day I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow or next week and god has
[2736.24 → 2741.44] let me see that in such a positive light rather than a negative it's exciting to not know the future
[2741.44 → 2747.44] when you trust in someone who does Jeremiah 29 verse 11 says for I know the plans i have for
[2747.44 → 2752.80] you declare the lord plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future
[2753.92 → 2758.56] I don't know the answer to most questions about faith and life but I do know that I have this life
[2758.56 → 2764.24] because of the lord has blessed me with amazing family and amazing friends who often feel
[2764.24 → 2769.68] like family he doesn't need me to know all the answers, but he needs me to love and trust in him
[2769.68 → 2775.04] I will mess up I am in no way perfect and I'm never going to try to be so today is a point for me to
[2775.04 → 2780.40] say I trust in the lord I put my trust in him and not myself I will put my anxieties on him because
[2780.40 → 2786.32] he can handle it more than I ever could I trust in the steadfast love of god forever and ever I will
[2786.32 → 2791.04] thank you forever because you have done it I will wait for your name for it is good in the presence
[2791.04 → 2798.40] of the godly psalm 52 8. you can stay right up here too because I'm going to invite Kim forward
[2798.40 → 2804.40] Allie has asked Kim prince to come forward and speak on her behalf
[2811.92 → 2819.92] oh okay um you guys did so good I like I'm shaking anyway uh I'm just super emotional to see like
[2820.56 → 2825.92] the future of our church right here this is amazing this is beautiful so um but I'm here to talk about
[2825.92 → 2833.12] ally so uh I've had the honour of hanging out with ally for the last couple of years we started hanging
[2833.12 → 2839.28] out in gyms now we were very good uh, but they kicked us out, and we headed to youth group so that's where
[2839.28 → 2845.84] we've been doing our life together uh, and it's been amazing to see allay mature and grow in her
[2845.84 → 2852.80] faith um ally I have two passages for you uh two that came to my mind the first one was instant
[2852.80 → 2858.96] uh, and it comes from first timothy 4 verse 12 don't let anyone look down on you because you're young
[2862.00 → 2868.96] I'm just gonna just calm my heart a little bit of hold on uh but set an example for the believers in
[2868.96 → 2876.40] speech in conduct in love in faith and in purity I already see you I've already seen you be this
[2876.40 → 2882.72] individual ally through your actions as staff at camp LCS for the last several years through volunteering
[2882.72 → 2889.60] as a youth um position in the new ground committee which is like for all of Canada which is incredible
[2890.40 → 2895.84] um the way that you always welcome new people with your warmness and your excitement for them
[2896.56 → 2903.92] and you're volunteering in the church which comes in many forms you are an example but what I've really
[2903.92 → 2909.04] loved watching last couple years which you actually spoke to today is that that wrestling with faith
[2909.04 → 2916.88] um I have I've seen you go through some hard questions in life and I've seen you seek out
[2916.88 → 2922.24] answers for those and be satisfied with not having answers and I think that's been really beautiful
[2923.12 → 2929.52] um yes and all that wrestling has brought you here to this moment where you might not have all the
[2929.52 → 2931.84] answers, but you are confident in who your god is
[2931.84 → 2941.44] yes almost done okay second passage is Hebrews 11 verse 1. now faith is confident in what we hope
[2941.44 → 2943.44] for and assurance about what we do not see
[2948.96 → 2957.52] ally may you continue to be an example walk in faith and know who god is
[2957.52 → 2972.32] so now I'm going to invite all three of you to come to the scary part right in the centre of the
[2972.32 → 2976.48] stage here and I'm going to invite pastor Chris to come forward, and he's going to lead you in
[2976.48 → 2980.40] the rest of your profession faith so you can stand nice in a row here and I'm going to get out of the way
[2980.40 → 2991.68] to be clear this isn't the scary part this is the good part why don't you move over just a little bit
[2991.68 → 3000.24] that way is it the scary spot I don't know Casey's fine with it uh we have opportunity this morning
[3000.24 → 3006.96] to celebrate god's goodness to celebrate god's faithfulness we've heard that testimony we've seen
[3006.96 → 3012.32] it lived in the lives of these three young people and in the people that have walked with them in
[3012.32 → 3023.36] faith these Sundays are my favourite Sundays because you guys are for us a lived example of god's goodness
[3026.48 → 3035.28] three times already I've been on the verge of tears because you are for us the fruit of the lord's labour
[3035.28 → 3042.24] in our midst, and now you get to join us in that same labour as you already have as you've already
[3042.24 → 3048.80] been doing but now in a new and particular way and so as you profess your faith we're going to ask you
[3049.36 → 3055.76] four questions I'll ask all four questions and then address you each by name to give your answer
[3055.76 → 3062.56] you can respond by saying I do with god's help cool if you forget I'll show you the paper, and you can see it
[3062.56 → 3071.44] it I'll ask all four questions and then I'll start with Casey first do you believe that Jesus Christ is
[3071.44 → 3078.24] the son of god sent to redeem the world do you love and trust him as the one who saves you from your sin
[3078.24 → 3086.08] and do you with repentance and joy embrace him as lord of your life and then second do you believe that
[3086.08 → 3091.68] the bible is the word of god revealing Christ and his redemption and that the confessions of this church
[3091.68 → 3099.36] faithfully reflect this revelation third do you accept the gracious promises of god sealed to you in your
[3099.36 → 3107.68] baptism and do you affirm your union with Christ and his church which your baptism signifies and then fourth
[3108.56 → 3114.08] do you promise to do all that you can with the help of the Holy Spirit to strengthen your love and commitment
[3114.08 → 3120.40] and commitment to Christ by sharing faithfully in the life of this church honouring and submitting to
[3120.40 → 3126.24] its authority and do you join with the people of god in doing the work of the lord everywhere
[3126.96 → 3135.44] Casey what is your answer I do with god's help amen madden what is your answer I do with god's help amen
[3135.44 → 3147.36] now in the name of our lord Jesus Christ I welcome you to the privileges of full communion I welcome
[3147.36 → 3154.32] you to full participation in the life of the church I welcome you to its responsibilities and its joys and
[3154.32 → 3161.44] its trials and its sufferings and made the god of peace who through the blood of the eternal covenant
[3161.44 → 3167.28] brought back from the dead our lord Jesus Christ that great shepherd of the sheep equip you with
[3167.28 → 3176.00] everything good for doing his will and may he work in you what is pleasing to him through Christ Jesus
[3176.00 → 3184.48] to whom be glory forever and ever amen congregation I'm going to invite you to thank god
[3184.48 → 3191.36] and to stand as you do so thank god by clapping because this is an amazing opportunity

[3488.80 → 3495.20] You have made me new, now life begins with you.
[3497.60 → 3506.14] It's your endless love, pouring down on us.
[3506.14 → 3513.62] You have made us new, now life begins with you.
[3515.16 → 3520.10] Released from my chains, I'm a prisoner no more.
[3520.86 → 3525.10] My shame was ransomed, he faithfully bore.
[3525.10 → 3531.30] He cancelled my debt, and he called me his friend.
[3531.54 → 3535.64] When death was arrested and my life began.
[3538.74 → 3546.64] Oh, your grace so free, washes over me.
[3546.64 → 3553.38] You have made me new, now life begins with you.

[3581.36 → 3587.10] Darkness rejoiced as though heaven had lost.
[3587.10 → 3594.84] But then Jesus rose with our freedom in hand.
[3595.64 → 3600.74] That's when death was arrested and my life began.
[3600.74 → 3611.50] Oh, your grace so free, washes over me.
[3611.50 → 3618.18] You have made me new, now life begins with you.
[3618.18 → 3628.38] It's your endless love, pouring down on us.

[3681.90 → 3682.90] Please have a seat.
[3687.48 → 3701.60] Good morning.

[3708.78 → 3709.86] Good morning, my name is Yap.
[3709.86 → 3712.28] I'm a deacon here at Langley Emanuel.
[3712.84 → 3715.24] This morning's offering will be for the well.
[3715.24 → 3719.04] The well is a church plant based out of Kelowna, BC.
[3719.04 → 3722.78] The well's hope is to create a space for belonging.
[3722.78 → 3727.82] And also that all who may, that all who come may encounter Jesus.
[3727.82 → 3733.46] And that they would leave having been seen and heard and inspired to live a little more faithfully.
[3734.46 → 3739.88] If you wish to give to the general budget, just mark the envelopes in the seats and write it on there.
[3739.98 → 3741.54] Otherwise, everything else will go to the well.
[3742.10 → 3742.52] Thank you.
[3745.24 → 3746.70] Thank you.
[3746.70 → 3750.10] Thank you.

[3925.68 → 3940.02] Good morning.
[3940.02 → 3947.12] If you are age three, well, anyway, kids can come up here, up to the front, age three, up to whoever wants to.
[3947.52 → 3951.64] In the summer for children's worship time, we have a preschool class.
[3951.64 → 3956.66] So if you are three or four or even going into kindergarten, you're welcome to come.
[3956.84 → 3962.38] And the rest of the kids, you are going to have the joy of joining the rest of us in church.
[3963.08 → 3972.82] There are little clipboards outs at the booth, if you didn't see that, that have some little activities that are related to what Pastor Chris will be speaking on.
[3972.92 → 3976.74] And those will be available throughout the summer for the kids who are staying in the service.
[3976.74 → 3982.08] All right, we're going to stand up and do the blessing right away.
[3982.56 → 3989.48] And then if you are the preschool kids, you can head off to your regular classroom and enjoy that.
[4006.74 → 4012.26] Good morning, everyone.
[4012.86 → 4013.80] My name is Eric.
[4013.94 → 4017.38] I'm just going to give you a we had our last council meeting before the summer.
[4017.72 → 4024.46] And I'm just giving you some highlights of what we were talking about there so you're aware that we're meeting and getting things done.
[4025.24 → 4029.30] We had a chance to welcome new council members and thank the outgoing members.
[4029.30 → 4036.58] We reviewed and accepted the recommendations from finance on the financial statements.
[4037.70 → 4045.22] We received an update from the kitchen planning committee and council is going to pursue additional feasibility assessments on that.
[4045.92 → 4050.40] We received an update on the ongoing staff evaluation process.
[4050.40 → 4062.40] So personnel is currently meeting with the staff that we have right now, and we're getting someone, a third party in this summer to do an evaluation of Kevin and Chris as well.
[4063.84 → 4066.60] We also received an update from the board of stewards.
[4069.04 → 4073.38] We elected, this is my last duty as council chair.
[4073.50 → 4077.82] So the keys to the chair suite have been passed off to Paul Kohl.
[4077.82 → 4079.96] He's going to be the chair of council going forward.
[4080.40 → 4087.46] Clary Klosterhoff is full council vice and Steve Service is going to stay on as a reporter.
[4087.84 → 4088.40] Thank you.
[4099.52 → 4100.16] Thanks, Eric.
[4100.34 → 4103.70] And thank you to all the council members for their faithful service as well.
[4104.10 → 4105.70] I think that deserves a hand as well.
[4105.70 → 4106.20] Thank you.
[4110.40 → 4113.52] Please join me in our church family prayer.
[4113.52 → 4126.70] Heavenly Father, as we gather in your presence today, we are grateful for your unfailing love and grace that sustain us through every season of life.
[4127.66 → 4131.56] Your spirit fills this place and your peace surrounds us.
[4132.30 → 4135.60] We come before you with hearts lifted in praise and thanksgiving.
[4135.60 → 4143.04] Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come.
[4143.92 → 4146.92] With all creation, we join in singing your praises.
[4147.64 → 4150.86] You are the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end.
[4153.04 → 4156.44] Forgive us, Lord, for we have fallen short of your glory.
[4156.44 → 4160.52] We confess our sins and ask for your mercy and forgiveness.
[4161.48 → 4164.96] Help us to walk in purity and in obedience to your will.
[4167.10 → 4173.90] Today we lift to you Casey, Madden, and Allie as they have publicly professed their faith in Jesus Christ.
[4174.54 → 4176.46] Thank you for their dedication and courage.
[4177.06 → 4181.04] But even more than that, thank you for your faithfulness in bringing them to this day.
[4181.04 → 4185.62] Bless them with your wisdom and strength as they grow in their journey with you.
[4187.38 → 4190.92] Lord, we also bring before you those who are grieving the loss of loved ones.
[4192.12 → 4197.28] Comfort them with your presence and surround them with your peace that surpasses all understanding.
[4198.32 → 4202.92] Bring healing to their hearts and remind them of the hope that we have because of Christ.
[4205.04 → 4207.80] We pray for our shut-ins and lonely members, Lord.
[4207.80 → 4212.42] May they feel your loving embrace and the support of this church family.
[4213.60 → 4219.62] Grant them moments of joy and companionship and strengthen them with your grace in their times of solitude.
[4221.58 → 4226.98] We also pray for strength and courage for the Astra family with Everly's pending surgery on Thursday.
[4228.28 → 4231.12] Grant wisdom to the doctors and full healing for Everly.
[4233.48 → 4237.66] We intercede for our community, for our nation, and the world.
[4237.80 → 4243.06] May your kingdom come and your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[4244.10 → 4249.96] Bring healing to the sick, comfort to the suffering, and reconciliation to the brokenhearted.
[4252.72 → 4256.00] Thank you, Lord, for your faithfulness that endures forever.
[4256.88 → 4260.78] We rejoice in the blessings of community and fellowship within this church.
[4261.44 → 4265.92] Thank you for the gift of life and for every good and perfect gift that comes from you.
[4265.92 → 4270.14] We also thank you for the word that we are about to hear,
[4270.40 → 4273.32] and we pray for your blessing on Pastor Chris as he brings it to us.
[4273.96 → 4278.32] May we have ears to listen and hearts of flesh that can be moved by your word.
[4280.40 → 4284.84] As we conclude our time of prayer, we unite our voices with the heavenly chorus.
[4285.64 → 4287.38] Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[4287.90 → 4289.30] Holy, holy is he.
[4289.96 → 4293.20] Sing a new song to him who sits on heaven's mercy seat.
[4293.20 → 4298.24] May your peace guard our hearts and minds in Christ Jesus,
[4298.72 → 4301.46] and may we continue to shine your light in the world.
[4302.36 → 4303.56] In Jesus' name we pray.

[4351.76 → 4352.70] Amen.
[4352.70 → 4359.02] and follow along. And I'm mindful of the fact that we have kids in our worship for the summer.
[4359.96 → 4365.16] And so for you kids, I want to encourage you to talk with your parents, but try to make a regular
[4365.16 → 4372.48] habit of bringing your own Bibles into church so that you can read with us and then maybe
[4372.48 → 4379.44] underline some things or draw some pictures or whatever. And for the kids, if you're drawing
[4379.44 → 4385.04] pictures during the service, I'd love to see them afterwards. I have a collection of kids' drawings
[4385.04 → 4389.20] actually from sermons. Some of them are hilarious because they're pictures of me, and some of them
[4389.20 → 4392.60] are hilarious because they have nothing to do with anything we said. But you know what? We're all in
[4392.60 → 4397.66] this together, and the Spirit works through broken vessels like me and like the rest of us here.
[4398.42 → 4404.94] I'm going to read 2 Corinthians 8, verse 1 through 15 for us to start.
[4404.94 → 4415.54] And now, brothers and sisters, we want you to know about the grace that God has given the
[4415.54 → 4423.42] Macedonian churches. In the midst of a very severe trial, their overflowing joy and their extreme
[4423.42 → 4431.52] poverty welled up in rich generosity. For I testify that they gave as much as they were able,
[4431.52 → 4439.30] and even beyond their ability, entirely on their own. They urgently pleaded with us for the privilege
[4439.30 → 4445.34] of sharing in this service to the Lord's people, and they exceeded our expectations.
[4446.50 → 4452.62] They gave themselves first to the Lord, and then by the will of God also to us.
[4453.76 → 4460.38] And so we urged Titus, just as he had earlier made a beginning, to bring also to completion this
[4460.38 → 4467.60] act of grace on your part. But since you excel in everything, in faith, in speech, in knowledge,
[4467.72 → 4474.34] in complete earnestness, and in the love we have kindled in you, see that you also excel in this
[4474.34 → 4483.68] grace of giving. I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing
[4483.68 → 4491.28] it with the earnestness of others. For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was
[4491.28 → 4498.26] rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you, through his poverty, might become rich.
[4500.06 → 4506.08] And here is my judgment about what is best for you in this matter. Last year, you who were the first
[4506.08 → 4512.40] not only to give, but also to have the desire to do so, now finish the work, so that your eager
[4512.40 → 4519.16] willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it according to your means. For if
[4519.16 → 4525.04] the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what
[4525.04 → 4531.42] one does not have. Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard-pressed, but
[4531.42 → 4538.22] that there might be equality. At the present time, your plenty will supply what they need, so that in
[4538.22 → 4544.72] turn, their plenty will supply what you need. The goal is equality, as it is written, the one who has
[4544.72 → 4551.44] gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little. This is
[4551.44 → 4560.56] the word of the Lord. Now, I want to, at the outset, start by saying,
[4560.56 → 4572.46] on a profession of faith Sunday, is it weird that the pastor is going to talk about giving and about
[4572.46 → 4580.40] money? And I know that what I'm about to say might be controversial, because sometimes we bristle
[4580.40 → 4590.00] at money sermons. But I want to follow in the line of Jesus, who says that there is no more spiritually
[4590.00 → 4599.80] indicative matter than how you handle your money. The gift of money and wealth is a test of the
[4599.80 → 4608.70] sincerity of your profession of faith. And so, this is for all of us, not just specifically those of you
[4608.70 → 4620.16] who have made profession of faith, but in the face of your potential frustration with the words that I am
[4620.16 → 4628.16] about to say as we talk about money, let me reframe that to say these are the words of God to us.
[4629.36 → 4636.62] And so, at least start from the perspective that says, what if this is so? What is God trying to say to
[4636.62 → 4643.50] me at this moment? Not what did that pastor say when he stood in front of us and told us what to do?
[4644.00 → 4650.84] Start with the perspective that God is speaking to us here. And then, if you have follow-up, you can
[4650.84 → 4656.70] talk to Pastor Kevin, because I'm going away on vacation for two weeks. But then he's going on
[4656.70 → 4663.84] vacation in a week. So, you've got about four days to figure that out. All right, let's jump in. So, I
[4663.84 → 4673.66] heard a story this week about a woman who had grown up in church, but because of circumstances that many
[4673.66 → 4681.04] of us can imagine and perhaps are familiar with, she left because of what she saw and experienced and
[4681.04 → 4687.88] what happened to her in that community. And according to her own record of this, to her own account of
[4687.88 → 4695.10] that, she left because she believed that God accepts us, or what she was taught was that God
[4695.10 → 4705.48] accepts us based on our own moral effort and based on conforming to a particularly narrow-defined strict
[4705.48 → 4713.78] rule for life. And so, that made, in her mind, God into some bygone being in the sky that needs to be
[4713.78 → 4723.00] placated and won over in order to earn his favour. Now, the woman is telling this story because years
[4723.00 → 4731.50] later, when she started feeling pulled into something again, and she started going back to church,
[4731.88 → 4740.68] and she started hearing, in her own heart, for the first time, the gospel of free grace in Jesus Christ,
[4740.68 → 4747.96] by which he loves us and forgives us in spite of ourselves, right, in spite of our efforts or its
[4747.96 → 4755.10] lack, in spite of our inability to do anything to please him, when she started hearing this truth,
[4755.52 → 4762.42] her whole world was changed. And when she heard the gospel in this way, her response was,
[4762.42 → 4774.40] this is a terrifying idea. It's good scary, she said, but still scary. And so, when she was asked,
[4774.48 → 4782.26] what do you mean, good scary? All right, what's so scary about unmerited and free grace? She answered,
[4783.14 → 4789.26] if I was saved by my good works, then there would be a limit to what God can ask of me,
[4789.26 → 4796.20] right? If I was saved by my good works, I would be like a taxpayer with certain rights. But if it's
[4796.20 → 4802.42] really true, she said, that I am a sinner saved by sheer grace at infinite cost to God himself,
[4802.72 → 4813.28] then there's nothing he can't ask of me. And that's scary. And for some of us, hearing that put
[4813.28 → 4821.32] that way, this is a terrible realization, right, if my very life, now and eternally, is based entirely
[4821.32 → 4827.98] on the unmerited, always and forever love of God revealed to us in the life, death, resurrection of
[4827.98 → 4834.32] Jesus Christ, and that's what we believe the Bible says, then that's going to work its way back and
[4834.32 → 4840.96] things are going to be different in how I approach the rest of my life, right? Since the gift is
[4840.96 → 4848.16] infinitely more than I can earn on my own, having received that gift, there's now no limit to what
[4848.16 → 4855.08] God can ask of me. And if you look at church history, and if you look at the church around the
[4855.08 → 4864.98] world, even if that means being faithful unto death, or poverty, or moving across the world in response to
[4864.98 → 4872.04] God's call to be a missionary, or living as a missionary right now in your neighbourhood, having
[4872.04 → 4880.58] to put up with that neighbour who you just can't get along with, if the gospel changes everything,
[4880.96 → 4889.10] like we say over and over and over again in this church, that includes your money, and your time,
[4889.10 → 4899.08] and your life. If the gospel changes everything, that includes your money, and your time, and your life.
[4899.52 → 4908.10] That's the banner under which we work this morning. The gospel changes our approach to money.
[4909.22 → 4915.92] Jesus makes this abundantly clear. He says explicitly in Matthew 6, and then in Luke 12,
[4915.92 → 4922.08] no one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to
[4922.08 → 4929.56] the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money. Or he went on to say in Luke 12,
[4929.88 → 4938.18] for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. So think about this, right? In a culture like
[4938.18 → 4948.68] ours, a culture that is in so many ways celebrating of greed, of big business, of freedom 55, right? Or 65,
[4948.96 → 4955.46] or 75, if the cost of living keeps going the way it's going. The single most indicative way that you
[4955.46 → 4961.90] can show the truth of God's grace in your life in that kind of culture, right? Is how you approach,
[4961.90 → 4969.78] or think about, or use money? And if you know and have experienced the unmerited, always and forever
[4969.78 → 4977.28] love of God, your heart is turned towards him. And then how you handle money will give substance to
[4977.28 → 4984.12] the words you use, to the profession of faith that you make, right? Your appropriation of the new life
[4984.12 → 4993.92] in Christ that is offered to you. And this, to me, is Paul's point in the text that we read this morning.
[4994.82 → 5000.96] Right? Paul contrasts the generosity of the Macedonian churches with his hopes for the
[5000.96 → 5009.30] Corinthian churches based on the gospel truth that, in verse 9, though Jesus was rich, yet for your sake
[5009.30 → 5018.26] he became poor, so that you, through his poverty, might become rich. And by this, Paul hopes to take
[5018.26 → 5025.38] the matter of giving, right, of giving in support of this mission, out of the realm of obligation
[5025.38 → 5032.50] and law, and to shift it, and our perception of it, into the world of unmerited grace.
[5033.58 → 5038.52] Right? Paul wants to reframe the experience of giving, of offering,
[5038.52 → 5046.40] so that it becomes an extension of the grace offered to you in Jesus. Right? By grace, you have been
[5046.40 → 5054.50] saved, and so by grace you give. A little background to help us make sense of this text.
[5056.10 → 5064.02] Sometime earlier, Paul wrote another letter to the Corinthian church, which we have recorded as
[5064.02 → 5068.68] 1 Corinthians. And in that letter, he writes,
[5068.68 → 5075.00] Now, about the collection for the Lord's people, do what I told the Galatian churches to do.
[5075.44 → 5080.16] On the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with
[5080.16 → 5085.62] your income, saving it up, so that when I come, no collections will have to be made. Then, when I
[5085.62 → 5091.00] arrive, I will give letters of introduction to the men you approve, and send them with your gift
[5091.00 → 5098.80] to Jerusalem. And now, Paul is on his way to Corinth to gather this collection and to take it
[5098.80 → 5106.04] to Jerusalem. He heads north around the Aegean Sea through tRNAs, through the region of Macedonia,
[5106.04 → 5114.50] and then he's going to come down south there towards Corinth. And on the way, he writes this letter that
[5114.50 → 5120.42] we have as 2 Corinthians, so that they'll be ready for him when he arrives. And this part of the letter,
[5120.62 → 5127.70] he hopes to unify, encourage, and motivate the believers in their giving, in their promised giving.
[5128.44 → 5135.12] Now, notice very clearly, right, Paul doesn't want to guilt people or to force them into giving.
[5135.90 → 5141.30] This isn't a guilt letter, and I hope you hear it very clearly, this is not a guilt sermon.
[5141.30 → 5145.82] Rather, Paul says of the Macedonians in verse 2,
[5146.24 → 5151.84] in the midst of a very severe trial, their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty
[5151.84 → 5154.42] welled up in rich generosity.
[5155.50 → 5161.50] Out of overflowing joy comes generosity. A joy that comes from knowing God
[5161.50 → 5164.44] leads inevitably to a rich generosity.
[5165.70 → 5169.86] But notice, again, before Paul commends the Macedonians,
[5169.86 → 5171.24] he opens by saying,
[5171.34 → 5177.20] and now, brothers and sisters, we want you to know about the grace that God has given the Macedonians.
[5178.12 → 5183.12] The Macedonians' generosity is a demonstration of God's grace.
[5184.58 → 5189.06] And so ultimately, Paul is recognizing God's grace in the Macedonians,
[5189.28 → 5194.18] and crediting them for living out of that grace in a consequent way,
[5194.18 → 5195.42] in a way that declares,
[5195.42 → 5196.76] this I believe.
[5197.80 → 5201.34] God's grace to you makes God's grace come out of you,
[5201.92 → 5204.34] or from you to others.
[5205.60 → 5209.86] And the way of God's grace is a way of joy, of true joy, right?
[5210.02 → 5210.80] Paul will say elsewhere,
[5210.92 → 5211.94] rejoice always.
[5212.28 → 5214.36] Again, I say rejoice.
[5215.34 → 5216.36] And the way of God
[5216.36 → 5219.68] doesn't make the Macedonians rich in money.
[5219.68 → 5221.30] In fact, Paul acknowledges, right?
[5221.36 → 5222.00] Did you catch it?
[5222.20 → 5223.50] That they live in poverty.
[5224.70 → 5228.60] God makes them rich in joy because of their appropriation.
[5228.80 → 5229.74] They're gathering,
[5229.88 → 5232.32] and they're receiving of God's grace for life,
[5232.46 → 5235.62] and for overcoming sin and death by that grace.
[5236.42 → 5238.50] And so the motive, then, for them,
[5238.84 → 5241.18] for giving to the church ministry,
[5241.18 → 5243.56] for the work of Paul and to the church in Jerusalem,
[5243.70 → 5246.98] the motive for them is gospel joy.
[5246.98 → 5251.54] And fundamentally, the message of God
[5251.54 → 5254.18] is a message of comfort and joy,
[5254.34 → 5256.90] joy inspired by the grace of God.
[5256.98 → 5259.38] And where there is joy in God's grace,
[5259.78 → 5264.26] even poverty can't stop it from welling up in generosity.
[5266.16 → 5269.66] In fact, it's this welling up of generosity
[5269.66 → 5273.26] that led the Macedonian churches to beg,
[5273.26 → 5276.98] beg to be included in the offering.
[5277.12 → 5278.96] In verse 3, Paul writes,
[5279.08 → 5282.10] For I testify that they gave as much as they were able,
[5282.22 → 5283.98] and even beyond their ability,
[5284.38 → 5285.70] entirely on their own,
[5286.02 → 5288.22] they urgently pleaded with us
[5288.22 → 5290.60] for the privilege of sharing in this service
[5290.60 → 5291.92] to the Lord's people.
[5293.92 → 5296.40] When grace is received and acknowledged
[5296.40 → 5297.50] and appropriated,
[5297.66 → 5300.48] joy overflows and needs are met.
[5300.48 → 5304.20] I visited a church once
[5304.20 → 5306.24] that had thousands of members.
[5307.22 → 5309.56] And when it came time in the worship service
[5309.56 → 5310.78] for the offering,
[5311.74 → 5313.74] one of the leaders of the church,
[5313.82 → 5314.54] a deacon in the church,
[5314.62 → 5315.76] went up to the front and said,
[5315.86 → 5317.36] Okay, brothers and sisters,
[5317.54 → 5319.80] we're going to pass the joy box around,
[5320.02 → 5321.42] and we invite you to give.
[5322.32 → 5324.20] And for the next five minutes,
[5324.24 → 5326.22] as the joy boxes were passed through the church,
[5326.22 → 5328.76] people were literally clapping and celebrating
[5328.76 → 5330.14] in giving.
[5331.54 → 5335.06] Giving what they had been given,
[5335.24 → 5337.24] responding to God's grace
[5337.24 → 5338.86] and overflowing with joy.
[5340.78 → 5342.86] I got to be honest and candid with you,
[5343.40 → 5345.04] when the deacons walk up here
[5345.04 → 5346.28] to pass our bags around,
[5346.62 → 5347.78] rarely do I think about clapping.
[5348.66 → 5349.66] But maybe we should.
[5350.94 → 5352.34] This is our chance to respond
[5352.34 → 5354.04] to what God has done in us
[5354.04 → 5355.42] and is doing through us.
[5356.90 → 5358.16] Whenever God's grace
[5358.16 → 5359.86] strikes us to the core,
[5360.24 → 5361.84] when God gives us
[5361.84 → 5363.66] what we couldn't ever have earned,
[5363.98 → 5366.96] our approach to everything else changes.
[5368.88 → 5370.60] Even that week in and week out
[5370.60 → 5371.96] liturgical act
[5371.96 → 5373.18] of passing the bag
[5373.18 → 5374.38] through the seats.
[5375.82 → 5376.86] Receiving grace,
[5377.08 → 5378.12] receiving Christ,
[5378.54 → 5379.48] our treasure
[5379.48 → 5380.86] is transformed
[5380.86 → 5382.10] from the things
[5382.10 → 5383.32] of this world
[5383.32 → 5384.80] where moth and rust
[5384.80 → 5385.44] destroyed,
[5385.78 → 5387.38] transformed to the joys
[5387.38 → 5388.92] of knowing Jesus.
[5389.90 → 5391.46] The Macedonian churches,
[5391.70 → 5393.24] as an example to us all,
[5393.50 → 5394.70] looked at their budgets
[5394.70 → 5395.32] and they were
[5395.32 → 5396.52] carried forward
[5396.52 → 5397.30] by the joy
[5397.30 → 5398.40] of receiving grace.
[5398.54 → 5399.40] And they gave more
[5399.40 → 5399.92] than they could,
[5400.12 → 5400.38] quote,
[5400.42 → 5401.60] afford to give.
[5401.86 → 5403.54] They begged for the opportunity
[5403.54 → 5406.32] to increase their poverty
[5406.32 → 5408.58] so that the mission of God
[5408.58 → 5409.86] might be accomplished.
[5411.86 → 5413.04] Sometimes in our churches,
[5413.70 → 5413.92] right,
[5413.92 → 5414.92] we talk about giving
[5414.92 → 5416.10] from our excess,
[5416.98 → 5418.16] but that's not the model
[5418.16 → 5418.90] of the New Testament.
[5420.64 → 5421.80] The model of the New Testament,
[5422.54 → 5422.78] right,
[5422.82 → 5423.64] we're told to give
[5423.64 → 5424.54] half
[5424.54 → 5426.18] or all.
[5427.58 → 5428.40] We're told to give
[5428.40 → 5429.12] sacrificially.
[5430.84 → 5432.02] The example that Paul
[5432.02 → 5432.84] holds up here
[5432.84 → 5434.30] in the Corinthian church,
[5434.58 → 5435.66] and this is the example
[5435.66 → 5436.38] that's held up
[5436.38 → 5437.70] to us today,
[5437.82 → 5438.62] Paul says in
[5438.62 → 5440.08] verse 7 and 8,
[5440.86 → 5442.56] but since you excel
[5442.56 → 5443.52] in everything,
[5443.78 → 5444.28] in faith
[5444.28 → 5444.98] and in speech
[5444.98 → 5445.62] and knowledge
[5445.62 → 5447.24] in complete earnestness
[5447.24 → 5447.94] and in the love
[5447.94 → 5449.04] we have kindled in you,
[5449.50 → 5451.48] see that you also excel
[5451.48 → 5452.92] in this grace of giving.
[5453.94 → 5455.06] I'm not commanding you,
[5455.28 → 5456.18] but I want to test
[5456.18 → 5456.92] the sincerity
[5456.92 → 5457.82] of your love
[5457.82 → 5459.08] by comparing it
[5459.08 → 5460.12] with the earnestness
[5460.12 → 5461.26] of others.
[5462.26 → 5463.38] I want you to hear that.
[5463.38 → 5466.40] Paul very intentionally
[5466.40 → 5468.54] avoids commanding
[5468.54 → 5469.30] people to give.
[5470.64 → 5470.74] Right,
[5470.96 → 5471.52] generosity
[5471.52 → 5473.24] with money,
[5473.38 → 5473.72] however,
[5473.84 → 5474.88] is proof
[5474.88 → 5477.10] of our treasure.
[5477.76 → 5478.78] It's an indication
[5478.78 → 5479.96] of receiving
[5479.96 → 5481.48] the grace of God.
[5482.02 → 5482.18] Right,
[5482.22 → 5482.78] how much
[5482.78 → 5483.68] or how little
[5483.68 → 5484.50] we give
[5484.50 → 5485.32] is proof,
[5485.50 → 5486.78] is testing
[5486.78 → 5487.66] the sincerity
[5487.66 → 5489.70] of our appropriation
[5489.70 → 5490.20] of the life
[5490.20 → 5491.12] of Jesus' death
[5491.12 → 5491.80] and resurrection
[5491.80 → 5492.96] in our place.
[5493.80 → 5494.62] And in a culture
[5494.62 → 5495.62] that is dominated
[5495.62 → 5496.94] so clearly
[5496.94 → 5497.88] by a love
[5497.88 → 5498.32] of money
[5498.32 → 5499.10] and a pursuit
[5499.10 → 5499.98] of happiness
[5499.98 → 5501.84] outside of relationship
[5501.84 → 5502.40] to God
[5502.40 → 5503.18] in Jesus Christ,
[5503.50 → 5504.74] perhaps the single
[5504.74 → 5505.92] the greatest testimony
[5505.92 → 5507.58] that we can give
[5507.58 → 5509.50] of having received
[5509.50 → 5510.68] God's love
[5510.68 → 5512.62] is giving away
[5512.62 → 5514.18] what everyone else
[5514.18 → 5515.18] so earnestly
[5515.18 → 5516.06] pursues for.
[5517.22 → 5517.64] Right,
[5517.68 → 5518.72] in line with Jesus' words,
[5518.72 → 5519.72] the best way
[5519.72 → 5520.40] to reveal
[5520.40 → 5521.16] our treasure
[5521.16 → 5522.04] to the world
[5522.04 → 5523.42] is by giving away
[5523.42 → 5524.54] to the world
[5524.54 → 5525.36] everything that's
[5525.36 → 5525.98] not our treasure.
[5527.46 → 5527.58] Right,
[5527.60 → 5528.38] our priorities
[5528.38 → 5529.48] in giving
[5529.48 → 5530.38] reflect what
[5530.38 → 5531.76] we truly love.
[5531.84 → 5532.48] Our priorities
[5532.48 → 5532.90] in giving
[5532.90 → 5533.76] reflect who
[5533.76 → 5535.56] we truly love.
[5535.62 → 5536.40] And if our heart
[5536.40 → 5537.06] is in line
[5537.06 → 5538.06] with the heart
[5538.06 → 5538.52] of grace
[5538.52 → 5539.24] that we have received
[5539.24 → 5539.74] from God,
[5539.80 → 5540.62] we will love
[5540.62 → 5541.92] what God loves
[5541.92 → 5542.74] and we will do
[5542.74 → 5544.14] what God does.
[5545.40 → 5546.10] And so in a church,
[5546.20 → 5546.80] we profess
[5546.80 → 5548.72] and we do
[5548.72 → 5549.94] and we do
[5549.94 → 5550.68] and we want impact
[5550.68 → 5554.18] and we want to see
[5554.18 → 5554.42] the lost
[5554.42 → 5554.98] and we want to see
[5554.98 → 5556.20] the lost saved.
[5556.26 → 5556.78] We profess
[5556.78 → 5557.44] and we proclaim
[5557.44 → 5558.08] that we love
[5558.08 → 5558.82] the church
[5558.82 → 5559.96] and we want to see
[5559.96 → 5561.82] this church built up.
[5562.80 → 5563.84] What you do
[5563.84 → 5564.70] with your money
[5564.70 → 5565.44] is a test
[5565.44 → 5566.30] of the sincerity
[5566.30 → 5567.60] of your love.
[5567.70 → 5568.24] What you do
[5568.24 → 5569.10] with your wealth
[5569.10 → 5571.30] and with your poverty
[5571.30 → 5573.60] is a testimony
[5573.60 → 5574.78] of the profession
[5574.78 → 5582.58] of faith, whether you made it this morning or you make it every week when we gather here in this
[5582.58 → 5594.50] place. Now, I believe that we here, most of us, many of us, I pray all of us, if we don't already,
[5594.62 → 5600.68] we are becoming, that we here know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich,
[5600.68 → 5608.06] yet for our sake he became poor so that we, through his poverty, might become rich. Right, Jesus Christ,
[5608.28 → 5615.28] none other than God Almighty himself, through whom the whole world was made, who upholds all things by
[5615.28 → 5621.04] his power and word, right, the one who existed in perfect communion with the Father and with the
[5621.04 → 5628.08] Spirit, who knew nothing other than immense joy and perfect fellowship, who basked in the glory of the
[5628.08 → 5635.98] Godhead. From this infinite, incomprehensible heights and incomparable riches, this Jesus emptied
[5635.98 → 5645.24] himself and took on the form of a slave. He came down, and he belittled himself to be born in a feeding
[5645.24 → 5651.26] trough in a forgotten part of a forgotten town. He came down and belittled himself to the point of death,
[5651.26 → 5658.84] an innocent man dying on a criminal's cross. And he did all of this in order that you, that we,
[5658.96 → 5665.26] might become rich. And not rich in the way of the world, not rich in money or status or other things
[5665.26 → 5676.62] that fade away, but rich in joy, rich in generosity, rich in love. This is the act of God. This is the grace
[5676.62 → 5685.96] of God that turns otherwise selfish people into joyful givers. And yes, this can be scary, right?
[5687.58 → 5698.00] But I pray good scary, right? An unsettling, holy discontent scary because God gave himself up and gave up
[5698.00 → 5705.12] everything so that we could live, we too, in response, can give up everything for him.
[5707.28 → 5714.90] It's too easy to think that holding on to things and keeping more and more, or trying to gather other
[5714.90 → 5720.50] and new and different, or the next best thing, it's too easy to think that that will provide joy and
[5720.50 → 5730.88] happiness. But God tells us, right, that his purpose in sending Jesus was to provide joy and true blessing.
[5732.74 → 5740.24] Either God alone is the true source of this joy or something else is. It cannot be both.
[5740.24 → 5752.80] And this morning, and every day, I'm banking on God. And this morning, as we've heard testimonies from
[5752.80 → 5759.02] these three young people, they're banking on God. They're calling us to do the same. I plead with you,
[5759.02 → 5769.66] do the same. Right? And if God values joyful, loving generosity so much that he sent his only son,
[5769.66 → 5775.82] whom he loves to create a people of joy and generosity, we can be assured that when we are
[5775.82 → 5784.74] more generous, we will be more fulfilled. And yes, even more joy filled, because we are about the very
[5784.74 → 5797.62] work of God. Now, as we land this plane and wrap this up, notice by way of application, very intentionally
[5797.62 → 5807.80] this morning, I have not once put a number or a percentage on our giving, on what you are called
[5807.80 → 5814.46] to give. Not once have we talked about a specific amount or a percentage or a requirement. And this is,
[5814.46 → 5822.60] as we've said, intentional, because it's about grace. It's not about rules. And a rule in this cannot be
[5822.60 → 5828.02] applied across the board. Notice what Paul says. He gives instructions for this in verse 11 and 12.
[5828.88 → 5835.64] Now finish the work that your eager willingness to do, so that your eager willingness to do it may be
[5835.64 → 5841.36] matched by your completion of it according to your means. For if the willingness is there, the gift is
[5841.36 → 5848.26] acceptable according to what one has, not according to what one does not have. So hear that, right? A
[5848.26 → 5854.76] principle for your giving. You give out of what you have, not out of what you don't have. Now, that's not the
[5854.76 → 5862.60] same as saying we give out of our excess, right? The hard truth of this is that most of us have more than we
[5862.60 → 5870.58] give. But what this principle is saying is that a person who makes $25,000 a year and gives a certain percent
[5870.58 → 5876.94] of that is far more generous than a person who makes $250,000 a year and gives the same percent.
[5879.10 → 5884.80] Right? There are very wealthy people who give away 90 percent, and they have the ability to live on all
[5884.80 → 5891.70] the rest, right? That's what generosity can look like. And like the Macedonians, when you have less,
[5891.86 → 5899.00] the generosity of your giving is more. And if people who have lost their jobs or who have lost a large
[5899.00 → 5906.40] portion of their savings because of whatever has happened in the previous year, right, that rich
[5906.40 → 5915.36] generosity, that generosity becomes rich, becomes more because it's coming out of less. And it's more
[5915.36 → 5921.64] costly, it's more sacrificial, and thus it's more generous. And the more generous we are, the more
[5921.64 → 5927.44] closely we reflect Jesus. The priority is not the number, hear this, it's the sacrifice.
[5927.44 → 5934.94] The priority is the reflection of the grace of God. The joy is in the sacrifice, not the number.
[5936.58 → 5943.44] And so, do you want to test the sincerity of your love? Give until you feel it.
[5944.96 → 5951.00] Until it makes a difference. Until there's a choice between giving to the mission of God and something
[5951.00 → 5957.46] else that you like, something else that you love. And then right when you're at that line, give more.
[5958.72 → 5963.66] Then you're testing the sincerity of your love, when it actually costs you something.
[5965.00 → 5971.06] Let me be really, really clear, okay? This right here, if you're visiting with us, right, don't hear what
[5971.06 → 5978.24] I'm not saying. Because this is a super generous church. This church knows how to give and respond
[5978.24 → 5984.86] to need. And I know that many of you give with this generous attitude and this generous heart.
[5985.26 → 5989.82] Right, last week at our congregational meeting, someone said we had a $30,000 need, they made a few
[5989.82 → 5993.24] phone calls, and boom, it was gone. That's amazing.
[5993.24 → 6003.60] And I know that that is because the gospel changes everything. And I know that you know,
[6003.68 → 6008.84] it's not enough just to say that, right, that you show it by your giving.
[6010.70 → 6018.76] But what we also are seeing here is that generous giving is a matter of spiritual health. It's a sign
[6018.76 → 6026.32] of you having received grace and understanding the cost of grace, not for you, but born by Jesus in
[6026.32 → 6031.62] your place. And the choice that you are being asked to consider, that we are being asked to consider,
[6031.62 → 6042.00] is a priority between personal wealth and spiritual health. And don't let the truth that some people
[6042.00 → 6047.68] here, many people here, are super generous. Don't let the truth of the generosity of this church,
[6047.68 → 6054.50] by and large, be an excuse for you not to be generous yourself. Don't let the fact that the
[6054.50 → 6063.36] high cost of living or high inflation be an excuse for low or for not giving. Jesus knew exactly what
[6063.36 → 6070.92] it would cost him to save you. And because it costs us nothing, we give him everything. And again,
[6070.92 → 6079.02] let me be really clear, this is for everyone, even you kids here this morning. A couple of weeks ago,
[6079.06 → 6087.10] we started the bottle campaign in the back, right? And on the bottles, it says, donate and save a life.
[6087.74 → 6093.76] And Malachi, my son, who's nine years old, really wanted one of those bottles. So he went to the back
[6093.76 → 6100.04] and he worked with Brenda to get it all filled out, and then he went home, and he emptied his piggy bank
[6100.04 → 6106.58] into the bottle. And he brought it to Rachel, my wife, and he said, mom, I hope I saved more than one life.
[6108.74 → 6116.64] That's his heart. Right? Even the youngest among us can show us the generosity of giving.
[6116.64 → 6129.60] Even you could be an example to us. And to Casey and Madden and Allie, you are an example to us.
[6130.82 → 6133.82] And let's all be an example to each other.
[6136.30 → 6142.26] And yes, to be abundantly clear, we spent all morning talking about money and about giving as the
[6142.26 → 6147.00] test of the sincerity of your love, because that's what our text does.
[6148.22 → 6150.80] But we all know that this is about so much more than money.
[6152.44 → 6156.60] Right? Every bit of your life is transformed by the gospel.
[6157.38 → 6160.58] Right? Jesus said on the cross, it is finished.
[6160.80 → 6167.36] And when you stand and profess to believe that, that means your new life in him has just begun.
[6167.36 → 6172.54] And that's what we get to live. That's who we get to be.
[6173.48 → 6180.02] And I, for one, am excited to see the joy and the generosity that comes from that.
[6180.94 → 6184.38] All God's people said, amen. Let's pray together.
[6188.32 → 6190.28] Holy, holy God.
[6190.28 → 6191.32] Holy, holy God.
[6191.76 → 6192.08] Holy, holy God.
[6192.72 → 6197.20] Your gospel is for us true riches.
[6197.54 → 6200.44] Your gospel is for us true joy.
[6201.12 → 6207.82] Out of the depths of our own sin, out of the death of our own realities,
[6208.28 → 6211.16] you have saved us and made us new.
[6212.16 → 6218.90] And so may our lives together be marked by your grace as we give generously,
[6218.90 → 6222.76] as we give out of our own grace received
[6222.76 → 6226.20] so that we might be a people of grace.
[6227.54 → 6230.84] And God, I praise your name for your goodness,
[6231.06 → 6232.36] your faithfulness to us
[6232.36 → 6235.12] as displayed in the professions of faith made,
[6235.38 → 6238.32] as displayed in the gathering each week of our worship
[6238.32 → 6240.44] where we boldly proclaim this gospel
[6240.44 → 6242.24] and we receive the power of your spirit.
[6242.52 → 6245.62] And I praise your name for the testimonies,
[6245.78 → 6248.64] for the sincerity of our love for you
[6248.64 → 6251.84] that is displayed in the giving of this church.
[6252.52 → 6254.92] Stretch us and grow us, we pray,
[6255.52 → 6258.44] that we might in ever-increasing measure
[6258.44 → 6261.84] be more like Jesus in the world around us.
[6262.32 → 6263.80] It's in his name that we pray.
[6264.48 → 6264.84] Amen.
[6264.84 → 6264.98] Amen.
[6271.20 → 6273.18] Please rise as we respond in song.
[6278.64 → 6281.72] We are one in the Spirit,
[6281.72 → 6284.88] we are one in the Lord.
[6284.88 → 6288.34] We are one in the Spirit,
[6288.72 → 6291.58] we are one in the Lord.
[6291.84 → 6295.34] And we pray that all unity
[6295.34 → 6298.34] may one day be restored.
[6298.34 → 6298.84] Amen.
[6298.84 → 6299.14] Amen.
[6299.14 → 6299.16] Amen.
[6300.22 → 6304.02] And they'll know we are Christians
[6304.02 → 6305.48] by our love,
[6305.60 → 6307.42] by our love.
[6307.50 → 6310.58] Yes, they'll know we are Christians
[6310.58 → 6312.54] by our love.
[6316.54 → 6320.32] We will walk with each other,
[6320.50 → 6323.34] we will walk hand in hand,
[6323.34 → 6326.88] we will walk with each other,
[6326.88 → 6329.84] we will walk hand in hand,
[6329.84 → 6333.88] and together we'll spread the news
[6333.88 → 6337.74] that God is in our land.
[6338.54 → 6341.72] And they'll know we are Christians
[6341.72 → 6343.12] by our love,
[6343.36 → 6345.08] by our love.
[6345.16 → 6348.12] Yes, they'll know we are Christians
[6348.12 → 6350.00] by our love.
[6350.00 → 6350.58] Amen.
[6350.58 → 6351.58] Amen.
[6351.58 → 6352.58] Amen.
[6352.58 → 6354.96] Amen.
[6354.96 → 6357.90] We will walk with each other,
[6358.12 → 6360.94] we will walk side by side,
[6361.04 → 6364.38] we will walk with each other,
[6364.62 → 6367.46] we will walk side by side,
[6367.56 → 6370.96] and we'll guard each man's dignity
[6370.96 → 6374.70] and save each man's pride.
[6376.02 → 6379.00] And they'll know we are Christians
[6379.00 → 6380.34] by our love,
[6380.60 → 6382.28] by our love,
[6382.28 → 6385.38] yes, they'll know we are Christians
[6385.38 → 6387.82] by our love.
[6391.82 → 6395.44] All praise to the Father,
[6395.66 → 6398.48] from whom all things come,
[6398.86 → 6402.24] and all praise to Christ Jesus,
[6402.24 → 6404.94] His only Son,
[6404.94 → 6408.04] and all praise to the Spirit,
[6408.04 → 6412.04] who makes us one.
[6412.04 → 6416.72] And they'll know we are Christians
[6416.72 → 6418.10] by our love,
[6418.26 → 6419.90] by our love,
[6419.90 → 6422.98] yes, they'll know we are Christians
[6422.98 → 6425.32] by our love.
[6425.32 → 6437.14] As you go into this week,
[6437.14 → 6439.74] go with the blessing of God.
[6440.20 → 6441.00] Just a reminder,
[6441.20 → 6442.02] before you do go,
[6442.80 → 6445.02] find Casey and Allie and Madden
[6445.02 → 6445.78] and encourage them
[6445.78 → 6446.74] and congratulate them.
[6447.28 → 6448.78] There will be a time of gathering
[6448.78 → 6450.96] and refreshment afterwards available.
[6450.96 → 6451.90] Please stick around.
[6452.70 → 6454.98] Remember that Brenda is at the Connect booth
[6454.98 → 6457.52] to talk to you about the food drive
[6457.52 → 6458.16] that's upcoming
[6458.16 → 6459.94] and the work that needs to be done
[6459.94 → 6460.84] in the next couple of weeks.
[6461.52 → 6464.22] And in 15 minutes
[6464.22 → 6465.94] after the last song,
[6466.32 → 6467.28] so you can look at the clock
[6467.28 → 6468.36] and then do the math from there,
[6468.44 → 6470.50] 15 minutes after we sing our last song,
[6471.04 → 6472.76] I'll lead a discussion group
[6472.76 → 6475.26] about Synod in the multipurpose room.
[6475.26 → 6475.66] Amen.
[6475.66 → 6477.84] Receive the blessing of God.
[6479.04 → 6481.62] God, go before you to lead you.
[6482.02 → 6484.38] God, go behind you to protect you.
[6484.66 → 6486.52] God, go beneath you to support you.
[6486.62 → 6489.06] And God, go beside you to befriend you.
[6489.54 → 6491.24] Do not be afraid.
[6491.82 → 6493.74] Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[6493.86 → 6495.24] Do not be afraid,
[6495.80 → 6499.80] but go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
[6500.80 → 6501.12] Amen.
[6501.12 → 6501.26] Amen.
[6505.26 → 6522.34] I know He rescued my soul.
[6522.90 → 6525.54] His blood has covered my sin.
[6525.62 → 6526.26] I believe.
[6529.06 → 6530.06] I believe.
[6530.06 → 6530.62] I believe.
[6530.62 → 6537.36] My shame He's taken away.
[6537.86 → 6541.00] My pain is sealed in His name.
[6541.08 → 6542.22] I believe.
[6544.68 → 6545.68] I believe.
[6549.76 → 6552.22] I'll raise a banner.
[6553.96 → 6556.98] My Lord has conquered the grave.
[6556.98 → 6560.26] My Redeemer lives.
[6560.26 → 6564.50] My Redeemer lives.
[6564.50 → 6567.50] My Redeemer lives.
[6567.50 → 6571.50] My Redeemer lives.
[6571.50 → 6576.64] I know He rescued my soul.
[6576.64 → 6579.96] His blood has covered my sin.
[6580.00 → 6581.20] I believe.
[6583.58 → 6584.88] I believe.
[6584.88 → 6592.12] My shame He's taken away.
[6592.12 → 6595.66] My pain is healed in His name.
[6595.66 → 6597.12] I believe.
[6597.12 → 6598.12] I believe.
[6598.12 → 6600.12] I believe.
[6600.12 → 6601.12] I believe.
[6601.12 → 6607.20] I'll raise a banner.
[6607.22 → 6611.96] My Lord has conquered the grave.
[6611.96 → 6628.10] My Redeemer lives, My Redeemer lives, My Redeemer lives, My Redeemer lives.
[6628.10 → 6635.54] You lift my burdens, I'll rise with you.
[6635.54 → 6644.56] I'm dancing on this mountaintop to see your kingdom come.
[6644.56 → 6663.92] My Redeemer lives, My Redeemer lives, My Redeemer lives, My Redeemer lives,
[6663.92 → 6676.92] My Redeemer lives, My Redeemer lives, My Redeemer lives.
