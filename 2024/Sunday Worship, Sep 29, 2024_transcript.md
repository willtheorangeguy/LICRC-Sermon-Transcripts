[0.00 --> 0.28]  Again.
[1.70 --> 2.14]  Yes.
[2.54 --> 2.94]  Anybody?
[3.30 --> 4.76]  It sure added to the song.
[5.98 --> 7.70]  Oh, yes, I see some coming up.
[7.70 --> 10.12]  We'll also help everybody with the words, so come on up.
[10.42 --> 14.08]  You know the song better than us, so if you can help us sing it as well.
[14.86 --> 17.36]  You can come right up on top so people can see.
[23.86 --> 25.58]  Anybody else want to join us?
[25.58 --> 26.58]  Yes.
[26.58 --> 31.98]  I know that us adults don't do the actions quite as well as the kids, but I mean you're
[31.98 --> 35.98]  free to follow their actions as well.
[39.38 --> 41.98]  And I really am stalling hoping that words are going to come back.
[44.12 --> 44.62]  Nope.
[44.62 --> 45.62]  It's all right.
[45.62 --> 46.12]  Nope?
[46.12 --> 46.62]  Okay.
[46.62 --> 47.62]  It's all right.
[47.62 --> 48.62]  Okay.
[55.58 --> 75.08]  Here we go.
[75.08 --> 85.56]  Save to show, save to show, save to show.
[88.30 --> 97.06]  I won't hear what tomorrow brings, with each morning I'll rise and sing.
[97.06 --> 109.46]  My God's love will lead me through, you are peace in my troubles, you are peace in my troubles.
[112.74 --> 121.46]  My light out, my light out, shining in darkness, I will call you home.
[121.46 --> 129.32]  My light out, my light out, I will just promise, you will carry me.
[129.32 --> 139.46]  Save to show, save to show, save to show, save to show.
[141.46 --> 143.10]  Save to show.
[143.10 --> 154.76]  Fire before us, you're the brightest, you will lead us through the storm.
[155.12 --> 163.10]  Fire before us, you're the brightest, you will lead us through the storm.
[163.14 --> 171.32]  Fire before us, you're the brightest, you will lead us through the storm.
[171.32 --> 180.54]  You will come before us, you're the brightest, you will lead us through the storm.
[181.18 --> 189.12]  My lighthouse, my lighthouse, shining in the darkness, I will follow you on.
[189.12 --> 198.26]  My lighthouse, my lighthouse, I will trust the promise, you will carry me straight to shore.
[198.26 --> 211.18]  Take to shore, take to shore, take to shore.
[215.18 --> 218.36]  You may let's all take a seat.
[218.36 --> 227.20]  So this time of confession and assurance.
[228.76 --> 231.82]  You know this summer I've been listening to the narthex.
[232.14 --> 234.62]  It's not a shameless plug but it really was.
[235.38 --> 240.56]  Anyway, I was thinking like walking through the Bible listening to our pastors would be pretty easy.
[240.56 --> 248.70]  But we got to the one podcast where they talked about the Israelites checking out the promised land.
[249.74 --> 251.92]  And it got me thinking.
[253.20 --> 266.68]  Have you ever caught yourself thinking like the ten leaders that went into the land and they looked around and they forgot who they were serving.
[266.68 --> 270.44]  They forgot how powerful God had moved in their midst.
[271.64 --> 274.52]  And they forgot everything God had done for them.
[276.58 --> 283.34]  So I was looking around and I thought, you know, I lost my place.
[283.34 --> 292.86]  When I look at the state of the world, I can forget.
[294.54 --> 299.62]  When I see uncertain times for myself, I can forget.
[303.34 --> 308.86]  When I don't see myself capable of doing a job before me, I forget.
[308.86 --> 317.14]  So I pray the Holy Spirit give us the spiritual eyes to see that God is in control of this world.
[318.58 --> 321.90]  Spiritual eyes to trust what God has in store for us.
[322.80 --> 326.96]  And just like Joshua and Caleb, the other two leaders,
[327.62 --> 332.12]  I just pray that we have the trust and faith in God to be able to rest in his promises.
[333.86 --> 335.12]  Why don't we stand up?
[335.12 --> 338.52]  I'm hoping we know this one a little bit easier.
[340.58 --> 341.68]  Lord, I need you.
[342.16 --> 343.46]  So let's stand and sing that.
[343.46 --> 344.46]  Thank you.
[356.62 --> 359.70]  Lord, I come.
[360.34 --> 363.46]  Why not thanks?
[363.46 --> 376.70]  Without you, I fall apart.
[377.64 --> 384.04]  The one that guides my heart.
[384.04 --> 394.38]  Lord, I need you, oh, I need you
[394.38 --> 401.00]  Every hour I need you
[401.00 --> 407.56]  My fond defense, my righteousness
[407.56 --> 413.00]  Oh God, how I need you
[413.00 --> 420.32]  Every time runs deep
[420.32 --> 423.96]  Your grace is born
[423.96 --> 427.42]  Where grace is found
[427.42 --> 431.00]  It's where you are
[431.00 --> 437.00]  Where you are, Lord, I am free
[437.00 --> 444.32]  Holiness is Christ in me
[444.32 --> 450.46]  Where you are, Lord, I am free
[450.46 --> 458.32]  Holiness is Christ in me
[458.32 --> 467.64]  Lord, I need you, oh, I need you
[467.64 --> 474.58]  Every hour I need you
[474.58 --> 480.64]  My fond defense, my righteousness
[480.64 --> 487.96]  Oh God, how I need you
[487.96 --> 488.96]  I need you
[488.96 --> 489.96]  I need you
[489.96 --> 490.96]  I need you
[490.96 --> 497.96]  When temptation runs my way
[497.96 --> 503.28]  When I cannot stand, I'll fall on you
[503.28 --> 509.28]  Jesus, you're my hope and stay
[509.28 --> 514.60]  When I cannot stand, I'll fall on you
[514.60 --> 520.60]  Jesus, you're my hope and stay
[520.60 --> 527.92]  Oh God, how I need you
[527.92 --> 529.92]  Oh, I need you
[529.92 --> 531.92]  Oh, I need you
[531.92 --> 537.92]  Every hour I need you
[537.92 --> 545.24]  My fond defense, my righteousness
[545.24 --> 549.24]  Oh God, how I need you
[549.24 --> 553.24]  Oh, I need you
[553.24 --> 558.24]  Oh, I need you
[558.24 --> 563.32]  Every hour I need you
[563.32 --> 565.28]  Every hour I need you
[565.28 --> 566.98]  Every hour I need you
[566.98 --> 568.02]  Every hour I need you
[568.02 --> 571.94]  My one defense, my righteousness
[571.94 --> 577.60]  Oh, God, how I need you
[588.24 --> 592.24]  Pray with me
[592.24 --> 597.70]  Abba Father, help us keep our eyes on you
[597.70 --> 601.22]  We so easily forget your greatness
[601.22 --> 602.94]  Your faithfulness
[602.94 --> 605.76]  The goodness you have showered on us
[605.76 --> 609.26]  Without you, life can look overwhelming
[609.26 --> 610.84]  And we can lose hope
[610.84 --> 614.40]  Forgive us for times we forget you
[614.40 --> 617.08]  And we try to rely on ourselves
[617.08 --> 620.82]  As we walk into another year of serving you
[620.82 --> 623.06]  Like Joshua and Caleb
[623.06 --> 625.90]  Help us put our trust in you
[625.90 --> 628.84]  By your spirit, give us boldness
[628.84 --> 631.32]  Knowing that you are for us
[631.32 --> 633.06]  And we can rest in you
[633.06 --> 635.86]  In Jesus' name we pray, amen
[647.08 --> 658.90]  Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[658.90 --> 663.96]  Holy, holy is He
[663.96 --> 671.08]  Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
[671.08 --> 675.90]  Holy, holy, holy is He
[675.90 --> 681.08]  Sing a new song
[681.08 --> 681.82]  Sing a new song
[681.82 --> 685.02]  To live with sin song
[685.02 --> 688.08]  Heaven's mercy see

[712.92 --> 741.32]  then
[742.92 --> 743.92]  Adore you.
[757.92 --> 767.92]  Golden rainbows, a living color, flashes of light in rolls of thunder.
[767.92 --> 780.92]  Blessing and honest man, glory and power, to the only one I see.
[780.92 --> 792.92]  Holy, holy, holy, the Son of God Almighty, who art to His, to His, to God.
[792.92 --> 802.92]  O creation I sing, praise to the King of kings.

[834.92 --> 846.92]  The love with wonder, all-struck wonder, at the mention of your name.
[846.92 --> 858.92]  Jesus, your name is power, breath of living water, and such a marvelous mystery.
[858.92 --> 874.92]  The love with wonder, heaven, the Shawn called, beats of knowing others, to Jesus.
[874.92 --> 880.70]  With all creation I sing praise to the King of Me.
[881.40 --> 886.74]  You are my everything, and God will adore you.

[927.80 --> 930.06]  It's time for the offering.
[931.50 --> 932.88]  There's no screen to type.

[987.80 --> 1000.66]  I lift my eyes up to the mountains.
[1000.66 --> 1005.42]  Where does my help come from?
[1005.42 --> 1019.42]  I have come to you, maker of heaven, creator of the earth
[1019.42 --> 1031.42]  Oh, how I need you, Lord, you are my only hope, you're my only prayer
[1031.42 --> 1045.42]  So I will wait for you to come and rescue me, come and hear me, Lord
[1045.42 --> 1058.42]  I lift my eyes up to the mountains, where does my help come from?
[1058.42 --> 1072.42]  I have come to you, maker of heaven, creator of the earth
[1072.42 --> 1084.42]  Oh, how I need you, Lord, you are my only hope, you're my only prayer
[1084.42 --> 1098.42]  So I will wait for you to come and rescue me, come and hear me, Lord
[1098.42 --> 1110.42]  I lift my eyes up to the mountains, where does my help come from?
[1110.42 --> 1124.42]  I lift my eyes up to the mountains, where does my love come from?
[1124.42 --> 1129.42]  I invite the kids to come forward if you are age 3, all the way up to grade 4
[1129.42 --> 1132.42]  We're super excited to start children's worship time again
[1132.42 --> 1135.42]  So I'm looking forward to seeing lots of people up here
[1135.42 --> 1142.42]  Just for parents, just a quick note, so our preschoolers, so the age 3 and 4s are going to be going to their room
[1142.42 --> 1145.42]  Which is to the left when you exit the sanctuary
[1145.42 --> 1150.42]  And then the kindergarten to grade 4s today will all be together in the multipurpose room
[1150.42 --> 1154.42]  Which is to the right-ish when you exit the sanctuary
[1154.42 --> 1157.42]  So especially if you have kindergarten and grade 1s
[1157.42 --> 1161.42]  We'd like you to pick them up from the multipurpose room at the end of the service
[1161.42 --> 1164.42]  So we know they're with the right family
[1164.42 --> 1165.42]  So that's where you will find them
[1165.42 --> 1169.42]  And the preschoolers you'll find on the left side there
[1169.42 --> 1171.42]  Good morning, everybody
[1171.42 --> 1175.42]  Feels like a long time since we've been all up here together
[1175.42 --> 1178.42]  Well, I'm excited that you're here
[1178.42 --> 1181.42]  Today in children's worship, we are going to be asking the question
[1181.42 --> 1183.42]  What is the Bible?
[1183.42 --> 1185.42]  What is the Bible?
[1185.42 --> 1188.42]  You guys know what it is?
[1188.42 --> 1191.42]  What are some things that we already know about the Bible?
[1191.42 --> 1192.42]  Amelia?
[1192.42 --> 1195.42]  Yeah, you read the Bible
[1195.42 --> 1197.42]  Exactly, Haley?
[1197.42 --> 1199.42]  It's God's Word
[1199.42 --> 1201.42]  It's the best book ever
[1201.42 --> 1203.42]  It's the best book ever
[1203.42 --> 1206.42]  They're separated into two parts
[1206.42 --> 1209.42]  So you guys know a bunch of things about the Bible
[1209.42 --> 1213.42]  It talks about God
[1213.42 --> 1215.42]  It tells us the story about God, exactly
[1215.42 --> 1221.42]  It's exactly a whole bunch of books about God
[1221.42 --> 1224.42]  So we're going to look at more about why it's important
[1224.42 --> 1226.42]  And what kinds of things are in the Bible
[1226.42 --> 1227.42]  And why we read it
[1227.42 --> 1230.42]  So that's going to be our focus today for children's worship
[1230.42 --> 1233.42]  So before we do our blessing, let's just pray together
[1233.42 --> 1235.42]  And then we'll stand up
[1235.42 --> 1240.42]  Lord God, thank you so much that we get to head to children's worship time

[1462.38 --> 1466.48]  grow and go in your name we pray amen
[1477.40 --> 1500.06]  as part of our launch season we have spent the last few weeks looking at our sort of mission statement
[1500.06 --> 1529.56]  that three word phrase gather grow go that we believe sort of sets out for us what it is that we do how we are called to be together in some ways the the idea of gather grow go is aspirational that is it's something we look towards and we pursue after together in some ways it's also inspirational in that it it it
[1529.56 --> 1559.22]  fills us with a sense of purpose that we share together and so two weeks ago we explored what the word gather means we developed a biblical theology for our gathering as a community of faith last week pastor Kevin led us as we explored what it means that we grow together that we mature as disciples in the faith again developing a sort of biblical theology for that and today
[1559.22 --> 1589.20]  today we look at the word go what does it mean that we look at the word go what does it mean that we are sent and what are the particulars of our shared identity together under the banner of and the idea of go and so there too we will look at a sort of brief biblical theology of sending and of being sent because of that we're going to look at a whole bunch of Bible
[1589.20 --> 1619.18]  texts and because the screen isn't working the way that we wanted to it might be a little bit more of a personal challenge for you to see the text and to follow along but there are Bibles at the back and if you're familiar enough with the Bible and you know where you can go back and forth to find these books that will be helpful to you if not just let the words come from me and wash over you hear them and maybe if you're a note taker just write down the
[1619.18 --> 1649.16]  text and then you can return to the text and then you can return to the text and then you can return to it later this week but the the banner sort of the starting place I want us to jump in is actually words of Jesus to his disciples from John 20 and really just one verse in 21 John 20 verse 21 this is after the resurrection Jesus has appeared to his disciples one time and he has appeared to Thomas
[1649.18 --> 1679.18]  and at the end of appearing or as part of appearing appearing to his disciples Jesus says peace be with you as the father has sent me I am sending you and with that he breathed on them and said receive the Holy Spirit if you forgive anyone's sins their sins are forgiven if you do not forgive them they are not forgiven
[1679.18 --> 1692.50]  but in your brother's sins their sins are forgivenário啡 they are forgiven they are shaken
[1692.62 --> 1700.28]  and swear what covenant be ok may the verse 20 is that in high said a day of trial and was sent in high school but from the first time till
[1700.28 --> 1715.10]  beginning, God has been sending his people. In the book of Exodus, in chapter 3, Moses meets God in
[1715.10 --> 1720.64]  the burning bush. Maybe you're familiar with that story. Moses has fled Egypt. He's gone to the
[1720.64 --> 1727.28]  wilderness at Midian, and there God calls him to be a prophet for the people and to go and speak to
[1727.28 --> 1735.18]  Pharaoh. And God says in Exodus 3, verse 10, now go, I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people,
[1735.34 --> 1743.18]  the Israelites, out of Egypt. Fast forward a few hundred years and to the prophet Isaiah now,
[1743.46 --> 1750.96]  God calls Isaiah and commissions Isaiah to go be a voice to the king of Israel. And he says, this is
[1750.96 --> 1756.96]  what we read in Isaiah, then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, whom shall I send and who will go
[1756.96 --> 1765.80]  for us? And then Isaiah says, here I am, send me. Similarly, a few hundred years after that, the
[1765.80 --> 1772.88]  prophet Jeremiah, right, is also sent. And then we read in Jeremiah 1, 7, but the Lord said to me,
[1773.44 --> 1782.14]  do not say I am too young. You must go to everyone I send to you and say whatever I command you.
[1782.14 --> 1787.74]  Now, in all of these examples, and there are more that we could pull out, this is an example of God
[1787.74 --> 1797.14]  sending a prophet to speak his word to the world and to reveal himself to the world through them and
[1797.14 --> 1804.78]  for them. And this idea of sending continues right through into the New Testament identity of the
[1804.78 --> 1811.54]  church, right? Jesus says, as the Father has sent me, I am sending you. Jesus also says in Matthew 10,
[1812.00 --> 1818.18]  I am sending you out like sheep among wolves, therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.
[1819.06 --> 1825.70]  This idea of sending isn't just a commissioning for general work, but also commissioning for
[1825.70 --> 1833.64]  particular work. In Romans 10, we read there that, how then can they call on the one they have not
[1833.64 --> 1838.20]  believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear
[1838.20 --> 1843.44]  without someone preaching to them? And how can anyone preach unless they are sent?
[1845.34 --> 1853.78]  We are a sent people with a prophetic message to proclaim to the world. And Jesus, knowing that
[1853.78 --> 1862.06]  we'll face challenges in this, he prays for us. In John 17, Jesus says in prayer to his Father,
[1862.06 --> 1867.96]  my prayer is not that you take them out of the world, but that you protect them from the evil one.
[1868.80 --> 1874.98]  They're not of the world, even as I am not of it. Sanctify them by your truth. Your word is truth.
[1875.18 --> 1883.10]  As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world. So over and over and over again,
[1883.18 --> 1891.04]  in the Bible, we see that God's people, first in Israel and now in the church, are a sent people.
[1892.06 --> 1898.60]  But what does it mean to be sent? What does it mean to go? That's what we're exploring
[1898.60 --> 1905.96]  this morning. So our big idea is that the church is a sent community, and we will see
[1905.96 --> 1914.40]  that in four ways. That our going is for blessing, our going is for revealing, and our going is for
[1914.40 --> 1917.74]  showing and our going is for contrasting.
[1921.06 --> 1928.56]  Before we get too far into that, I also want to make a distinction. Because especially, especially
[1928.56 --> 1936.80]  if you've grown up in the Christian church in the Western world your whole life, it's really easy
[1936.80 --> 1943.72]  to think about this going, this mission of the church, as missions, with an S on the end.
[1944.22 --> 1952.70]  To think about sending as going far away. Or to think that some things that we do are
[1952.70 --> 1957.12]  like missionary activities, and other things we do are just not.
[1957.12 --> 1963.96]  Coming out of that, it's easy for some of us to think that some people do like sacred work,
[1964.48 --> 1967.94]  and the rest of us do like secular work.
[1969.26 --> 1974.60]  And because I'm a pastor paid by a church, that must mean that everything that I do is sacred.
[1975.60 --> 1980.78]  And because you're an engineer, that must mean everything you do is secular.
[1980.78 --> 1988.72]  But that's not actually the case. When we see that God has always called and sent people. In fact,
[1988.86 --> 1994.96]  what I hope that we'll begin to see is that it's not about where you go, or even it's not about what
[1994.96 --> 2006.00]  you do specifically, but it's more about how you be when you go and when you do. It's more about who
[2006.00 --> 2013.16]  you are as you are in the midst of life in these places. And so really, what I want us to do is
[2013.16 --> 2022.18]  to think more holistically, and you can hear in that, more biblically about our being sent, about our going
[2022.18 --> 2032.10]  together. This past week, I had a chance to gather with some of the committee leaders and coordinators
[2032.10 --> 2037.52]  from ministries and team leaders here. We gathered for an evening on Thursday of encouragement and
[2037.52 --> 2041.40]  celebration of God's work, and it was a beautiful night together. And one of the things that we
[2041.40 --> 2050.06]  discussed there was that our mission, as those who are called to gather, grow, and go, is ultimately
[2050.06 --> 2056.64]  indivisible, right? And so part of what we do is going to lean more heavily towards gather when we do
[2056.64 --> 2061.04]  that, like right now. Part of what we do is going to lean more towards grow when we do that,
[2061.04 --> 2067.46]  right? Lord willing, like right now. And part of what we do is going to lean more towards go. But in a
[2067.46 --> 2075.26]  big picture, ultimate sense, everything we do exists in the middle space of all three of those,
[2076.72 --> 2083.10]  right? This is ultimately this identity of gather, grow, go about who we are as a church,
[2083.84 --> 2090.22]  right? We gather and grow so that our going will be fueled by the Holy Spirit and God's transformation
[2090.22 --> 2098.32]  in our lives. We go so that others may be gathered up into our growing. We grow so that our going can
[2098.32 --> 2105.18]  be with confidence and the Holy Spirit capabilities. And so our gathering may bring more and more praises
[2105.18 --> 2113.82]  to the one who grows us, right? Our gathering is for going and we gather to scatter.
[2113.82 --> 2122.08]  Or to put it another way, and this is language that I'm borrowing from Michael Goheen, who's a
[2122.08 --> 2126.22]  missiologist, who's a professor of mine. A number of you might know him. He lives here in the area.
[2127.60 --> 2136.80]  To put it another way, the communal life of the church comes together for the going apart
[2136.80 --> 2147.08]  in order that we might come together again. Right? Even our going out is gathered because we do it as
[2147.08 --> 2157.30]  one in our unique but individual places. And so, seeing all of these threads tied together as one,
[2157.56 --> 2163.96]  what I'd like to do is spend the rest of our time looking at these four ideas about how it is that we
[2163.96 --> 2173.30]  go. How it is that we are sent. To begin, I want to start in Genesis 12. Genesis 12 is the beginning
[2173.30 --> 2181.76]  of the Bible, first book of the Bible. It's the call of Abram. And so God reaches out and comes to the
[2181.76 --> 2191.54]  world and he calls a particular man. And this is those first few verses. Genesis 12, 1 to 3, we read,
[2191.54 --> 2221.52]  Now notice the trajectory there, the through,
[2221.52 --> 2229.14]  Abraham is the through line. Abraham is gathered up to God and God grows a family around him so that
[2229.14 --> 2238.42]  the gathered and grown family can be a blessing to all peoples on earth. Our going is for blessing.
[2240.20 --> 2246.46]  And this pattern continues over and over and over again. God gathers up a community
[2246.46 --> 2253.50]  and grows them into a new kind of family, the body of Christ, brothers and sisters in faith. And then
[2253.50 --> 2259.46]  he sends us out to be a blessing to our neighbors and our neighborhoods, to be a blessing to our city
[2259.46 --> 2267.52]  and our region and our country and the world. Notice in this text,
[2267.52 --> 2278.54]  God calls Abraham to go to a place he doesn't yet know and thus begins the journey of his going.
[2279.46 --> 2286.78]  This is the story of our faith, the journey of our going into those places that God calls us. And along
[2286.78 --> 2297.70]  the way, we're called to bless those around us. Now, I want to offer just a brief admission at this point,
[2297.78 --> 2305.22]  because there's a danger and there's a difficulty here. And Abraham faced it and we face it the same.
[2305.22 --> 2313.58]  Because the reality is that most of the world doesn't actually know what's good for it.
[2316.38 --> 2323.12]  Most of us don't actually know what's best for us. We have some pretty significant ideas,
[2323.72 --> 2326.82]  right? And we would make some pretty significant claims about that.
[2326.82 --> 2337.40]  But the truth is, right, in our world and in our own hearts and lives, if we reject God, we reject goodness.
[2338.70 --> 2346.02]  And so then what is actually a blessing for you might seem outlandish or crazy to those people who
[2346.02 --> 2349.78]  don't know this God who calls you onto a journey with him.
[2349.78 --> 2359.42]  The truth is that this good news, this calling and journeying with God, will bring opposition
[2359.42 --> 2368.24]  as the church goes and challenges the deep convictions of the culture that surrounds it,
[2368.26 --> 2374.02]  the culture that doesn't yet know God. And this is going to happen particularly and deeply
[2374.02 --> 2381.42]  when we become involved in the institutions of our culture, when we become involved in the everyday
[2381.42 --> 2389.48]  life of creation and celebration in the world that we live in, right? The church is charged with a
[2389.48 --> 2399.94]  mission that goes out from this place into public life, into our culture. And as disciples of Jesus,
[2399.94 --> 2408.28]  we participate and are involved in the ongoing cultural task of the world and the welfare of our
[2408.28 --> 2417.52]  neighbors. And sometimes that's going to bring hardship to us as we have to say things like,
[2418.34 --> 2427.80]  this is actually for your good. And that's going to create points of conflict at some times and some
[2427.80 --> 2434.02]  places. And all of you can think of ways that you've experienced that or ways that you might.
[2435.50 --> 2441.34]  And the scripture's response to that, the scripture's encouragement is that even when you have to bring
[2441.34 --> 2448.82]  a challenging and prophetic word, do it with gentleness and respect. Or we are encouraged to
[2448.82 --> 2454.92]  live such good lives among those who don't believe that though they accuse you of doing wrong,
[2454.92 --> 2459.68]  though they think what you're doing is crazy, they see your good deeds and they glorify God.
[2461.38 --> 2467.88]  Right? This is Jesus when he says, pray for those who rule over you, pray for the emperors.
[2468.48 --> 2471.88]  Right? This is Jesus who says, bless those who persecute you.
[2473.28 --> 2477.32]  And this is the identity of the church that's called to be a blessing that we might live at peace
[2477.32 --> 2482.36]  with everyone. This is the words of Jeremiah to the people who were carried away into exile. He says,
[2482.36 --> 2490.00]  seek the peace and prosperity, the well-being of the city that God has carried you into. This is Babylon.
[2491.64 --> 2497.78]  Right? And that theme returns in the New Testament church as they engage in the emperor of Rome and the
[2497.78 --> 2508.62]  Roman Empire, bringing goodness and good news. Right? Being a blessing. And so as Christians who
[2508.62 --> 2518.24]  gather, we must also go in the work of politics and in the work of justice and in the work of mercy.
[2519.80 --> 2527.68]  This is how we are sent to be a blessing. And every one of you can do that in some way.
[2527.68 --> 2539.10]  You can be a blessing to your neighbors if you're in grade 10. You can be a blessing to your co-workers
[2539.10 --> 2546.04]  if you're in engineering. I had to return to that one because I started with that one saying that it
[2546.04 --> 2554.54]  was a secular activity. But that's how all of these activities get lifted up into the sacred task
[2554.54 --> 2567.26]  of our calling. Going is for blessing. Additionally, going is for revealing. And here I'm looking at
[2568.06 --> 2576.04]  Exodus 19. So if you're still in Genesis, the next book of the Bible is Exodus. Exodus 19,
[2576.04 --> 2583.12]  verse 5 and 6, God says to his people,
[2583.94 --> 2590.68]  Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all the nations you will be my treasured
[2590.68 --> 2598.92]  possession. Although the whole earth is mine, you will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.
[2600.36 --> 2602.96]  These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites.
[2602.96 --> 2610.70]  And so God tells Moses in that moment that his people are to be a kingdom of priests.
[2613.34 --> 2623.10]  That Israel shall fulfill a priestly role as a people in the midst of the peoples.
[2623.92 --> 2629.30]  That is that through Israel, God is represented in the world of nations.
[2629.30 --> 2636.34]  And what priests are for in a people, Israel is to be as a people for the world.
[2638.18 --> 2640.90]  Now because of this, this shaping identity,
[2641.74 --> 2647.46]  I'll make quickly just outline for you three elements of what being a priest means in the Old Testament.
[2648.74 --> 2653.72]  Right? Three aspects that a priest has as part of their role.
[2653.72 --> 2658.38]  First, a priest is set apart in holiness.
[2660.40 --> 2664.20]  And a priest, second, mediates God's presence.
[2664.60 --> 2667.90]  That is, he brings God's presence to the people.
[2668.14 --> 2674.80]  And a priest does all of this, returning to a theme, for the sake of others.
[2674.80 --> 2681.78]  Right? In Israel, God's holy presence is made known through the work of the priest.
[2682.56 --> 2689.60]  The holy life and the behavior of the priest functions as a model of consecration and devotion to God.
[2690.48 --> 2695.40]  Right? Everything about this priest is set apart for God's use.
[2695.82 --> 2698.52]  And that actually is the simplest definition of holiness.
[2698.52 --> 2702.40]  Right? It's to be set apart for God and for his use.
[2703.76 --> 2707.20]  A priest embodies, I might even say incarnates,
[2707.62 --> 2714.18]  a priest incarnates the holiness of God to the people for the people.
[2715.70 --> 2718.70]  And as you go forward, as we read into the New Testament,
[2719.08 --> 2723.26]  we realize again that this isn't about some sort of sacred, secular divide.
[2723.26 --> 2730.10]  Instead, everything and everyone is gathered up into this identity of being priests,
[2730.30 --> 2733.34]  gathered up into this being set apart for God's purposes.
[2735.02 --> 2740.94]  Right? In some way, just as sin has stained everything with its sort of parasitic nature,
[2741.28 --> 2743.80]  right, in the inverse, in the redemption of that,
[2744.10 --> 2748.68]  everything that we do is claimed by the blood of Jesus for the purposes of God.
[2748.68 --> 2755.46]  Now, this idea of the priestly role is actually fleshed out a little bit more in Leviticus.
[2756.14 --> 2759.60]  Leviticus is a book all about the priestly offices and the sacrifices
[2759.60 --> 2761.66]  and the things that needed to be made.
[2761.80 --> 2766.74]  And in chapter 21, which is a chapter about rules for priests,
[2767.06 --> 2771.72]  it says that the people should consider the priests holy
[2771.72 --> 2777.84]  because I, the Lord, am holy, I who make you holy.
[2779.22 --> 2780.40]  And so again, track that, right?
[2780.60 --> 2784.22]  The priest is holy because God is holy and they represent God,
[2784.32 --> 2787.68]  and through them, God makes the people holy.
[2789.04 --> 2790.90]  First of all, wow!
[2792.56 --> 2793.84]  What a responsibility!
[2794.98 --> 2795.66]  What a privilege!
[2795.66 --> 2804.44]  But second, right, that means that everything the priest does is for the people,
[2804.96 --> 2807.14]  for the sake of others,
[2807.64 --> 2810.76]  to make them holy, set apart for God's purposes,
[2810.92 --> 2812.50]  to be God's instrument in the world,
[2812.58 --> 2816.06]  to make more and more set apart for his purposes.
[2817.84 --> 2820.02]  Again, Michael Goheen, he summarizes it.
[2820.08 --> 2820.34]  He says,
[2820.34 --> 2823.46]  Israel, as a priestly nation in the world,
[2823.82 --> 2826.12]  is to be totally devoted to God's service
[2826.12 --> 2828.26]  and to model in its corporate life
[2828.26 --> 2830.20]  allegiance to the true God
[2830.20 --> 2833.64]  and the life of blessing that God means for all.
[2834.92 --> 2837.30]  And again, you're starting to see, right?
[2837.86 --> 2841.14]  This image, this calling, this responsibility
[2841.14 --> 2844.56]  carries forward to the new Israel,
[2844.72 --> 2845.34]  to the church.
[2845.62 --> 2848.38]  That's you and I who believe by grace through faith.
[2850.34 --> 2854.48]  In 1 Peter, we read the exact same language
[2854.48 --> 2857.46]  from what we read here in Exodus 19.
[2857.86 --> 2859.50]  You also, like living stones,
[2859.62 --> 2861.56]  are being built up into a spiritual house
[2861.56 --> 2863.66]  to be a holy priesthood,
[2864.00 --> 2865.76]  offering spiritual sacrifices
[2865.76 --> 2868.00]  acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
[2868.54 --> 2870.42]  You are a chosen people,
[2870.56 --> 2871.66]  a royal priesthood,
[2871.70 --> 2872.58]  a holy nation,
[2872.98 --> 2874.32]  God's special possession,
[2874.96 --> 2877.34]  that you may declare the praises of him
[2877.34 --> 2878.72]  who called you out of darkness
[2878.72 --> 2881.52]  into his wonderful light.
[2883.08 --> 2885.44]  In fact, as we look even further forward
[2885.44 --> 2886.78]  in the book of Revelation,
[2886.98 --> 2889.62]  which we've gone from Genesis to Revelation
[2889.62 --> 2891.08]  to the end of the Bible,
[2891.54 --> 2895.44]  now Jesus, we read in Revelation 1 verse 6,
[2895.56 --> 2898.54]  Jesus has made us to be a kingdom
[2898.54 --> 2902.72]  and priests to serve his God and Father.
[2903.18 --> 2906.84]  To him be glory and power forever and ever.
[2907.46 --> 2908.46]  Earlier in our worship,
[2908.60 --> 2910.90]  we read from Revelation 4 and 5
[2910.90 --> 2912.62]  as we were called into worship.
[2912.74 --> 2913.60]  And there we read,
[2913.92 --> 2915.66]  and they sang a new song saying,
[2915.82 --> 2917.54]  you are worthy to take the scroll
[2917.54 --> 2918.90]  and to open its seals
[2918.90 --> 2920.24]  because you were slain
[2920.24 --> 2922.18]  and with your blood you purchased for God
[2922.18 --> 2923.78]  persons from every tribe
[2923.78 --> 2925.44]  and language and people and nation.
[2925.78 --> 2926.48]  And then hear this,
[2926.48 --> 2928.52]  you made them to be a kingdom
[2928.52 --> 2931.00]  and priests to serve our God
[2931.00 --> 2934.22]  and they will reign on earth.
[2935.34 --> 2939.12]  The calling of all people of God everywhere
[2939.12 --> 2942.36]  has always been to be a priest.
[2944.02 --> 2946.48]  Our going is for revealing.
[2947.18 --> 2949.62]  A priest is set apart in holiness.
[2949.86 --> 2951.72]  A priest mediates God's presence
[2951.72 --> 2952.54]  and his blessing.
[2952.94 --> 2954.22]  And a priest does it all
[2954.22 --> 2955.80]  for the sake of others.
[2955.80 --> 2957.08]  When we say,
[2957.60 --> 2957.82]  gather,
[2958.00 --> 2958.18]  grow,
[2958.38 --> 2958.74]  go,
[2959.36 --> 2960.70]  what we are saying is,
[2960.88 --> 2962.30]  you are priests.
[2963.08 --> 2964.22]  We are all priests
[2964.22 --> 2965.92]  and ministers of our God.
[2967.20 --> 2968.40]  When we gather
[2968.40 --> 2969.34]  and you grow
[2969.34 --> 2970.86]  so that you can go,
[2971.30 --> 2972.38]  go into the world.
[2973.06 --> 2974.66]  Set apart in his holiness.
[2975.38 --> 2976.34]  Go into the world
[2976.34 --> 2977.08]  bringing God
[2977.08 --> 2978.14]  and his presence
[2978.14 --> 2979.88]  closer to those around you.
[2979.96 --> 2980.82]  Go into the world
[2980.82 --> 2981.50]  for the sake
[2981.50 --> 2982.70]  of other people.
[2983.36 --> 2984.20]  Showing them God.
[2984.20 --> 2985.32]  Showing the presence
[2985.32 --> 2986.20]  of Jesus.
[2986.40 --> 2987.68]  Go as a kingdom of priests
[2987.68 --> 2988.42]  to reveal
[2988.42 --> 2990.40]  the great high priest.
[2993.12 --> 2995.66]  Let me illustrate it this way.
[2995.92 --> 2998.02]  Imagine that you're sailing
[2998.02 --> 3000.50]  on a dark and stormy night
[3000.50 --> 3001.16]  out at sea.
[3001.58 --> 3002.66]  Waves are crashing up
[3002.66 --> 3003.40]  against your boat.
[3003.62 --> 3004.44]  You can hardly see
[3004.44 --> 3005.46]  anything around you.
[3005.78 --> 3006.34]  And suddenly,
[3006.66 --> 3007.84]  in the distance,
[3008.24 --> 3009.50]  cutting through the darkness,
[3009.50 --> 3011.02]  you see a lighthouse
[3011.02 --> 3011.98]  shining brightly
[3011.98 --> 3012.62]  from the shore.
[3013.98 --> 3015.04]  That lighthouse
[3015.04 --> 3016.46]  cuts through the darkness
[3016.46 --> 3017.48]  and guides you
[3017.48 --> 3019.32]  safely to the harbor.
[3021.20 --> 3022.20]  That lighthouse
[3022.20 --> 3023.16]  doesn't exist
[3023.16 --> 3024.46]  for itself.
[3026.50 --> 3027.38]  That lighthouse
[3027.38 --> 3028.74]  exists for the sailors,
[3028.96 --> 3029.48]  for you,
[3029.76 --> 3030.72]  lost at sea.
[3032.42 --> 3034.20]  It stands firm
[3034.20 --> 3035.06]  and strong
[3035.06 --> 3035.64]  and tall,
[3035.80 --> 3036.48]  shining its light,
[3036.70 --> 3037.78]  not for its own sake,
[3037.78 --> 3039.32]  but to help others
[3039.32 --> 3039.88]  find the way.
[3041.38 --> 3042.18]  This is the role
[3042.18 --> 3042.80]  of a priest.
[3043.24 --> 3044.02]  Just as the lighthouse
[3044.02 --> 3045.20]  shines its light
[3045.20 --> 3045.98]  to guide people,
[3046.38 --> 3047.62]  priests bring the light
[3047.62 --> 3048.40]  of God's presence
[3048.40 --> 3049.12]  into the world.
[3049.38 --> 3050.56]  They don't shine their light
[3050.56 --> 3051.40]  just for themselves,
[3051.66 --> 3052.44]  but they do so
[3052.44 --> 3053.42]  that others can see
[3053.42 --> 3054.40]  and can be guided
[3054.40 --> 3056.16]  to safety in God.
[3057.18 --> 3058.06]  And in the Old Testament,
[3058.22 --> 3059.06]  Israel was supposed
[3059.06 --> 3060.32]  to be like a lighthouse
[3060.32 --> 3061.60]  for the nations,
[3061.76 --> 3062.46]  showing the world
[3062.46 --> 3063.26]  who God is
[3063.26 --> 3064.24]  and what he's like
[3064.24 --> 3065.62]  and how we can come
[3065.62 --> 3066.36]  to him.
[3066.42 --> 3067.06]  And today,
[3067.38 --> 3068.22]  that continues
[3068.22 --> 3069.06]  with Christians
[3069.06 --> 3070.14]  called to be
[3070.14 --> 3071.08]  that lighthouse.
[3071.44 --> 3072.52]  Our lives are meant
[3072.52 --> 3074.46]  to reflect God's holiness
[3074.46 --> 3075.46]  and his love
[3075.46 --> 3076.28]  to the world.
[3076.40 --> 3077.62]  We are set apart,
[3077.82 --> 3078.24]  holy,
[3078.58 --> 3080.02]  not to hide away,
[3080.20 --> 3080.96]  but to shine
[3080.96 --> 3081.96]  God's light
[3081.96 --> 3083.14]  for others to see.
[3084.74 --> 3085.74]  Like priests,
[3086.14 --> 3087.94]  we bring God's presence,
[3088.08 --> 3088.96]  his blessing
[3088.96 --> 3089.78]  to the world,
[3089.92 --> 3090.68]  guiding others
[3090.68 --> 3091.84]  to find their way
[3091.84 --> 3092.84]  to him.
[3092.84 --> 3094.28]  and our going
[3094.28 --> 3095.78]  is for revealing.
[3095.98 --> 3097.68]  And this goes perfectly
[3097.68 --> 3100.16]  into the next idea
[3100.16 --> 3100.92]  that our going
[3100.92 --> 3102.14]  is for sharing.
[3103.42 --> 3104.14]  We've already used
[3104.14 --> 3104.90]  the image of light,
[3105.00 --> 3105.90]  so let's continue it.
[3106.56 --> 3108.62]  In Isaiah 49,
[3109.12 --> 3112.52]  Isaiah 49, verse 6,
[3113.42 --> 3114.48]  we read that,
[3115.48 --> 3117.00]  it is too small a thing
[3117.00 --> 3118.24]  for you to be my servant
[3118.24 --> 3119.90]  and restore the tribes
[3119.90 --> 3120.32]  of Jacob
[3120.32 --> 3121.00]  and bring back
[3121.00 --> 3121.70]  those of the house
[3121.70 --> 3122.84]  of Israel I have kept.
[3123.16 --> 3124.80]  I will also make you
[3124.80 --> 3126.72]  a light for the Gentiles
[3126.72 --> 3128.22]  that my salvation
[3128.22 --> 3129.00]  may reach
[3129.00 --> 3129.74]  to the ends
[3129.74 --> 3130.84]  of the earth.
[3132.22 --> 3133.30]  God's point here
[3133.30 --> 3135.52]  is that it's not enough
[3135.52 --> 3136.06]  for Israel
[3136.06 --> 3137.76]  just to be for herself,
[3138.02 --> 3139.34]  but Israel is to be
[3139.34 --> 3140.44]  for every nation,
[3140.58 --> 3142.72]  a light to every nation.
[3142.84 --> 3143.26]  Our going
[3143.26 --> 3144.26]  is for showing.
[3144.66 --> 3146.50]  God sends his people out
[3146.50 --> 3148.26]  to show the world
[3148.26 --> 3149.46]  his salvation.
[3149.46 --> 3151.40]  and he sends his people
[3151.40 --> 3152.38]  out to show the world
[3152.38 --> 3153.96]  how to find their way
[3153.96 --> 3154.70]  back to him,
[3154.78 --> 3155.86]  to be brought back
[3155.86 --> 3157.56]  to him by his grace
[3157.56 --> 3158.70]  and mercy.
[3159.74 --> 3161.92]  This idea of God
[3161.92 --> 3162.84]  lighting the way
[3162.84 --> 3164.12]  is actually ultimately
[3164.12 --> 3165.64]  fulfilled in Jesus
[3165.64 --> 3166.34]  who says,
[3166.72 --> 3167.56]  I am the light
[3167.56 --> 3168.10]  of the world.
[3169.10 --> 3170.34]  But that same Jesus
[3170.34 --> 3170.98]  who says,
[3171.06 --> 3171.62]  I am the light
[3171.62 --> 3172.10]  of the world,
[3172.38 --> 3173.22]  in John 8,
[3173.30 --> 3173.54]  he says,
[3173.62 --> 3174.14]  I am the light
[3174.14 --> 3174.54]  of the world.
[3174.62 --> 3175.52]  Whoever follows me
[3175.52 --> 3176.24]  will never walk
[3176.24 --> 3176.68]  in darkness,
[3176.68 --> 3177.28]  but will have
[3177.28 --> 3177.70]  the light
[3177.70 --> 3178.28]  of life.
[3178.70 --> 3179.56]  That same Jesus
[3179.56 --> 3180.00]  who says,
[3180.12 --> 3180.54]  I am the light
[3180.54 --> 3180.96]  of the world,
[3181.20 --> 3182.04]  stands in front
[3182.04 --> 3183.28]  of you as his disciples
[3183.28 --> 3183.84]  and says,
[3184.00 --> 3185.08]  you are the light
[3185.08 --> 3186.08]  of the world.
[3187.06 --> 3188.00]  This is Matthew 5,
[3188.18 --> 3189.04]  you are the light
[3189.04 --> 3189.52]  of the world.
[3189.62 --> 3190.34]  A town built
[3190.34 --> 3190.78]  on a hill
[3190.78 --> 3191.52]  cannot be hidden.
[3192.18 --> 3192.80]  Neither do people
[3192.80 --> 3193.42]  light a lamp
[3193.42 --> 3194.38]  and put it under a bowl.
[3194.80 --> 3195.06]  Instead,
[3195.22 --> 3196.22]  they put it on its stand
[3196.22 --> 3196.90]  and it gives light
[3196.90 --> 3198.00]  to everyone in the house.
[3198.18 --> 3198.96]  In the same way,
[3199.26 --> 3199.90]  let your light
[3199.90 --> 3201.00]  shine before others
[3201.00 --> 3202.08]  that they may see
[3202.08 --> 3202.84]  your good deeds
[3202.84 --> 3204.28]  and glorify your Father
[3204.28 --> 3205.30]  in heaven.
[3209.44 --> 3212.18]  Part of what we do
[3212.18 --> 3213.44]  in their gathering
[3213.44 --> 3216.38]  is to learn more about
[3216.38 --> 3217.22]  and to clarify
[3217.22 --> 3218.68]  for ourselves
[3218.68 --> 3220.52]  the redemption of God
[3220.52 --> 3221.28]  and the mystery
[3221.28 --> 3222.66]  of God's gospel
[3222.66 --> 3223.46]  being applied
[3223.46 --> 3225.36]  to us as believers
[3225.36 --> 3227.64]  so that we can go
[3227.64 --> 3228.94]  from this place
[3228.94 --> 3231.16]  carrying that message
[3231.16 --> 3234.62]  but I also think
[3234.62 --> 3236.68]  that sometimes
[3236.68 --> 3239.28]  we forget,
[3239.66 --> 3240.74]  as Pete prayed,
[3241.74 --> 3242.66]  we forget
[3242.66 --> 3245.02]  that this gospel message
[3245.02 --> 3246.88]  carries within it
[3246.88 --> 3248.40]  the power of God
[3248.40 --> 3249.40]  unto salvation.
[3250.08 --> 3251.06]  Romans 1.16.
[3252.16 --> 3253.10]  And that's because
[3253.10 --> 3254.34]  Christ himself,
[3254.66 --> 3255.82]  the eternal word,
[3256.12 --> 3256.96]  is present
[3256.96 --> 3258.28]  in God's word
[3258.28 --> 3258.92]  to us.
[3259.20 --> 3260.10]  Christ himself
[3260.10 --> 3261.72]  is available
[3261.72 --> 3263.40]  in all his saving power
[3263.40 --> 3265.48]  through this word,
[3265.64 --> 3266.86]  through this message
[3266.86 --> 3268.34]  that we carry.
[3269.70 --> 3270.78]  God's power
[3270.78 --> 3273.30]  to transform lives,
[3273.70 --> 3275.70]  to raise dead hearts
[3275.70 --> 3277.34]  and give them new life,
[3277.46 --> 3278.10]  God's power
[3278.10 --> 3279.10]  to take us
[3279.10 --> 3280.06]  from our being dead
[3280.06 --> 3280.94]  and our transgressions
[3280.94 --> 3281.44]  and sins
[3281.44 --> 3282.98]  and transforming us
[3282.98 --> 3284.82]  into a new creation
[3284.82 --> 3285.26]  in him,
[3285.44 --> 3286.86]  the power of the truth
[3286.86 --> 3287.72]  that Jesus lived
[3287.72 --> 3288.80]  the life I should have lived
[3288.80 --> 3289.64]  and died the death
[3289.64 --> 3290.42]  that I deserve,
[3290.50 --> 3292.36]  the power that raised God
[3292.36 --> 3293.16]  from the dead
[3293.16 --> 3294.92]  and has transformed
[3294.92 --> 3296.44]  each and every one of us
[3296.44 --> 3296.84]  who believe,
[3296.90 --> 3298.44]  that power is available
[3298.44 --> 3299.22]  to you
[3299.22 --> 3300.38]  in your speaking,
[3300.74 --> 3301.90]  in your declaring,
[3302.22 --> 3303.40]  in your proclaiming,
[3303.48 --> 3304.38]  in your lighting
[3304.38 --> 3305.14]  the way
[3305.14 --> 3306.18]  back to God.
[3307.92 --> 3308.88]  At the word of God,
[3308.96 --> 3309.52]  the gospel
[3309.52 --> 3311.16]  is a message
[3311.16 --> 3312.08]  powerfully
[3312.08 --> 3313.02]  and fully
[3313.02 --> 3313.96]  incarnated
[3313.96 --> 3314.90]  in the person
[3314.90 --> 3315.48]  of Jesus
[3315.48 --> 3316.66]  and then,
[3316.86 --> 3318.02]  because of that,
[3318.28 --> 3319.32]  is incarnated
[3319.32 --> 3319.96]  in the life
[3319.96 --> 3320.78]  and the words
[3320.78 --> 3321.50]  and the deeds
[3321.50 --> 3323.30]  of us,
[3324.02 --> 3324.78]  his church,
[3325.40 --> 3325.94]  the body.
[3328.24 --> 3329.12]  As the church
[3329.12 --> 3329.98]  then attends
[3329.98 --> 3331.30]  to the word of God
[3331.30 --> 3332.02]  and to fellowship,
[3332.32 --> 3333.26]  gathering and growing,
[3333.44 --> 3334.20]  to the Lord's Supper,
[3334.34 --> 3335.26]  gathering and growing,
[3335.52 --> 3336.16]  and to prayer,
[3336.34 --> 3337.22]  gathering and growing,
[3337.58 --> 3338.92]  it's built up,
[3339.00 --> 3340.02]  we are built up
[3340.02 --> 3340.60]  in the life
[3340.60 --> 3341.18]  of the Spirit
[3341.18 --> 3343.52]  and sent out.
[3344.70 --> 3345.02]  And actually,
[3345.14 --> 3345.46]  Goheen,
[3345.58 --> 3346.46]  he calls this
[3346.46 --> 3348.62]  the bipolar orientation
[3348.62 --> 3349.58]  of the church.
[3350.22 --> 3350.46]  That is,
[3350.50 --> 3351.36]  the church must be
[3351.36 --> 3353.60]  inward and outward facing.
[3354.30 --> 3355.58]  The inward life
[3355.58 --> 3357.64]  strengthens the kingdom life
[3357.64 --> 3359.48]  so that it is vitally connected
[3359.48 --> 3361.06]  to its outward manifestation.
[3362.12 --> 3362.48]  Again,
[3362.90 --> 3363.56]  our gathering
[3363.56 --> 3364.62]  and growing
[3364.62 --> 3365.70]  and going
[3365.70 --> 3367.06]  all exists
[3367.06 --> 3368.36]  together.
[3369.46 --> 3370.94]  And this missionary identity
[3370.94 --> 3372.14]  of the church,
[3372.24 --> 3373.42]  this sent reality
[3373.42 --> 3374.78]  for us,
[3375.14 --> 3376.64]  continues throughout.
[3376.74 --> 3377.98]  That's the great commission
[3377.98 --> 3378.46]  of Jesus,
[3378.58 --> 3380.32]  to go into all nations
[3380.32 --> 3381.08]  and make disciples.
[3381.24 --> 3382.68]  That's the great commission
[3382.68 --> 3383.56]  of Acts 1,
[3383.66 --> 3384.44]  to be witnesses
[3384.44 --> 3386.46]  to Judea and Samaria
[3386.46 --> 3387.20]  and to the ends
[3387.20 --> 3387.72]  of the earth,
[3388.02 --> 3389.58]  filled with the Holy Spirit,
[3390.12 --> 3391.52]  is to bring the light
[3391.52 --> 3394.02]  of the gospel.
[3397.16 --> 3397.88]  I don't know
[3397.88 --> 3398.56]  how many of you
[3398.56 --> 3401.72]  are currently watching
[3401.72 --> 3402.54]  or have already
[3402.54 --> 3403.44]  given up on
[3403.44 --> 3405.04]  the Rings of Power series
[3405.04 --> 3406.18]  on Amazon Prime.
[3408.26 --> 3409.82]  If you're a Tolkien fan,
[3410.40 --> 3412.14]  probably won't like
[3412.14 --> 3412.86]  the TV show
[3412.86 --> 3414.54]  because it's been
[3414.54 --> 3415.52]  kind of disappointing,
[3415.72 --> 3416.28]  to be honest.
[3417.14 --> 3418.48]  But one of the things
[3418.48 --> 3419.04]  they get right,
[3419.10 --> 3419.82]  and this was in the most
[3419.82 --> 3420.40]  recent episode
[3420.40 --> 3421.24]  from this past week,
[3421.24 --> 3424.70]  one of the characters
[3424.70 --> 3425.96]  is finally standing up
[3425.96 --> 3426.94]  and has realized
[3426.94 --> 3427.96]  who Sauron is
[3427.96 --> 3428.56]  and he speaks
[3428.56 --> 3429.64]  with one of the other characters
[3429.64 --> 3432.10]  and they finally get it right
[3432.10 --> 3433.14]  and this was Tolkien's point
[3433.14 --> 3433.62]  all along.
[3434.20 --> 3435.36]  The character said,
[3435.52 --> 3436.10]  Celebrimbor,
[3436.26 --> 3437.36]  the only thing
[3437.36 --> 3438.76]  that defeats the dark
[3438.76 --> 3440.80]  is the light.
[3442.38 --> 3443.04]  And then he says,
[3443.12 --> 3444.04]  the darker the night,
[3444.76 --> 3446.10]  the greater the light
[3446.10 --> 3447.00]  cuts through it.
[3448.78 --> 3449.68]  That's what we do.
[3449.68 --> 3452.60]  We shine the light
[3452.60 --> 3453.20]  of the gospel
[3453.20 --> 3454.72]  into the darkness
[3454.72 --> 3455.94]  because the only thing
[3455.94 --> 3457.10]  that defeats the dark
[3457.10 --> 3458.44]  is the light.
[3458.78 --> 3459.86]  And Jesus,
[3460.34 --> 3461.24]  the light of the world,
[3461.40 --> 3462.42]  has made you
[3462.42 --> 3463.58]  a light
[3463.58 --> 3464.94]  for the world.
[3466.66 --> 3468.12]  We are sent,
[3468.26 --> 3469.22]  we go
[3469.22 --> 3471.18]  to reveal.
[3472.40 --> 3473.28]  And then lastly,
[3473.90 --> 3474.94]  our going
[3474.94 --> 3477.22]  is for contrasting.
[3478.56 --> 3479.54]  The church
[3479.54 --> 3481.48]  is a contrast
[3481.48 --> 3482.20]  community.
[3483.48 --> 3484.42]  What does Jesus say?
[3484.52 --> 3485.08]  Jesus says,
[3485.44 --> 3486.24]  You are the salt
[3486.24 --> 3486.84]  of the earth,
[3486.94 --> 3487.54]  but if salt
[3487.54 --> 3488.78]  loses its saltiness,
[3488.94 --> 3489.64]  how can it be
[3489.64 --> 3490.48]  made salty again?
[3491.02 --> 3491.30]  And again,
[3491.34 --> 3491.54]  he says,
[3491.60 --> 3492.06]  You are the light
[3492.06 --> 3492.58]  of the world.
[3492.86 --> 3493.48]  A town built
[3493.48 --> 3493.82]  on a hill
[3493.82 --> 3494.44]  cannot be hidden.
[3494.56 --> 3495.36]  In the same way,
[3495.46 --> 3496.10]  let your light
[3496.10 --> 3497.20]  shine before others
[3497.20 --> 3498.22]  that they may see
[3498.22 --> 3498.92]  your good deeds
[3498.92 --> 3500.04]  and glorify God.
[3500.86 --> 3501.74]  Jesus calls
[3501.74 --> 3502.50]  his disciples
[3502.50 --> 3503.52]  salt and light,
[3503.72 --> 3504.32]  which means
[3504.32 --> 3505.10]  that they are living
[3505.10 --> 3505.80]  in a way
[3505.80 --> 3507.32]  that contrasts
[3507.32 --> 3508.14]  the world's
[3508.14 --> 3510.08]  decay and darkness.
[3511.50 --> 3512.24]  The church's
[3512.24 --> 3513.66]  distinct life together,
[3513.76 --> 3514.32]  our distinct
[3514.32 --> 3515.10]  gathering and
[3515.10 --> 3515.80]  growing together,
[3516.12 --> 3517.56]  reveals God's
[3517.56 --> 3518.90]  kingdom values.
[3519.50 --> 3520.12]  This is what Paul
[3520.12 --> 3521.32]  means in Romans 12.
[3521.42 --> 3521.62]  He says,
[3521.76 --> 3522.40]  Do not conform
[3522.40 --> 3523.02]  to the pattern
[3523.02 --> 3523.54]  of this world,
[3523.64 --> 3524.48]  but be transformed
[3524.48 --> 3525.50]  by the renewing
[3525.50 --> 3526.04]  of your mind.
[3526.94 --> 3528.24]  Paul calls the church
[3528.24 --> 3529.54]  to be transformed
[3529.54 --> 3530.80]  by God's truth
[3530.80 --> 3532.46]  rather than conforming
[3532.46 --> 3533.26]  to the ideas
[3533.26 --> 3533.78]  of the world.
[3533.78 --> 3535.20]  And it's this
[3535.20 --> 3536.62]  non-conformist
[3536.62 --> 3538.88]  idea and reflection.
[3539.36 --> 3539.82]  It's our
[3539.82 --> 3540.90]  counter-cultural
[3540.90 --> 3542.02]  reality
[3542.02 --> 3543.02]  in the midst
[3543.02 --> 3543.78]  of the world
[3543.78 --> 3544.92]  that makes the church
[3544.92 --> 3546.92]  a contrast community.
[3548.16 --> 3548.98]  The communal
[3548.98 --> 3550.04]  life of the church
[3550.04 --> 3551.76]  manifests the coming
[3551.76 --> 3552.80]  of the kingdom,
[3552.96 --> 3553.82]  the breaking in
[3553.82 --> 3554.80]  of God
[3554.80 --> 3555.56]  into the world.
[3556.40 --> 3557.06]  And so mission,
[3557.42 --> 3558.10]  first of all,
[3558.30 --> 3559.02]  is the life
[3559.02 --> 3560.04]  of this contrast
[3560.04 --> 3560.68]  community
[3560.68 --> 3561.64]  lived out,
[3561.74 --> 3562.62]  the radiant
[3562.62 --> 3564.42]  and resplendent
[3564.42 --> 3565.12]  demonstration
[3565.12 --> 3565.90]  of God's
[3565.90 --> 3567.18]  creational intent
[3567.18 --> 3568.26]  for human life
[3568.26 --> 3569.18]  and the goal
[3569.18 --> 3569.96]  that God has
[3569.96 --> 3570.58]  for redemption
[3570.58 --> 3572.88]  of all of history.
[3575.46 --> 3576.78]  And so we look
[3576.78 --> 3578.04]  particular
[3578.04 --> 3579.72]  and peculiar.
[3581.46 --> 3582.38]  Philippians 2,
[3582.48 --> 3583.26]  one of my favorite
[3583.26 --> 3585.12]  chapters in the whole Bible,
[3585.78 --> 3587.44]  after showing us
[3587.44 --> 3588.46]  a beautiful picture
[3588.46 --> 3589.04]  of Christ,
[3589.20 --> 3589.66]  it says,
[3589.78 --> 3590.14]  Your attitude
[3590.14 --> 3590.94]  should be the same
[3590.94 --> 3592.10]  as that of Christ Jesus.
[3592.10 --> 3592.70]  And then we get
[3592.70 --> 3593.38]  this excellent
[3593.38 --> 3594.12]  and amazing
[3594.12 --> 3595.20]  Christ hymn
[3595.20 --> 3596.02]  where it describes
[3596.02 --> 3597.26]  how Christ emptied
[3597.26 --> 3597.82]  himself.
[3599.18 --> 3600.02]  He took on
[3600.02 --> 3601.02]  the form,
[3601.16 --> 3602.04]  the flesh
[3602.04 --> 3603.30]  of a human being
[3603.30 --> 3603.94]  and he became
[3603.94 --> 3604.46]  obedient,
[3604.72 --> 3605.48]  even obedient
[3605.48 --> 3606.32]  unto death
[3606.32 --> 3607.36]  on a cross.
[3608.34 --> 3609.14]  And because of that,
[3609.22 --> 3610.16]  God exalts him
[3610.16 --> 3611.26]  to the highest place
[3611.26 --> 3611.94]  that at the name
[3611.94 --> 3612.36]  of Jesus
[3612.36 --> 3613.34]  every knee should bow
[3613.34 --> 3614.08]  and tongue confess
[3614.08 --> 3615.28]  in heaven and on earth
[3615.28 --> 3615.92]  and under the earth
[3615.92 --> 3616.78]  that Jesus Christ
[3616.78 --> 3617.28]  is Lord
[3617.28 --> 3618.16]  to the glory
[3618.16 --> 3618.70]  of God
[3618.70 --> 3619.54]  our Father.
[3619.54 --> 3621.60]  and then we read,
[3622.88 --> 3624.30]  Because of this truth,
[3624.92 --> 3626.42]  because of who Jesus is
[3626.42 --> 3627.62]  and what he has done,
[3628.96 --> 3629.82]  do everything
[3629.82 --> 3630.70]  without grumbling
[3630.70 --> 3631.44]  or arguing
[3631.44 --> 3632.96]  so that you may become
[3632.96 --> 3634.42]  blameless and pure,
[3634.90 --> 3635.82]  children of God
[3635.82 --> 3636.68]  without fault
[3636.68 --> 3637.32]  in a warped
[3637.32 --> 3638.58]  and crooked generation.
[3639.14 --> 3640.78]  And then you will shine
[3640.78 --> 3641.82]  like stars
[3641.82 --> 3643.08]  in the sky.
[3643.46 --> 3644.12]  The older way
[3644.12 --> 3644.94]  of translating that
[3644.94 --> 3646.00]  is then you will shine
[3646.00 --> 3646.70]  like stars
[3646.70 --> 3647.34]  in the universe
[3647.34 --> 3648.90]  as you hold out
[3648.90 --> 3650.26]  the word of life.
[3651.52 --> 3652.56]  In contrast
[3652.56 --> 3655.08]  to a warped
[3655.08 --> 3656.46]  and crooked generation,
[3657.20 --> 3658.94]  church is called out
[3658.94 --> 3660.60]  to be blameless
[3660.60 --> 3661.76]  and pure.
[3664.76 --> 3665.44]  Picture
[3665.44 --> 3668.08]  a lush,
[3668.84 --> 3669.30]  vibrant,
[3669.82 --> 3670.66]  beautiful
[3670.66 --> 3671.58]  oasis
[3671.58 --> 3672.48]  of a garden
[3672.48 --> 3673.88]  in the middle
[3673.88 --> 3675.52]  of a barren desert.
[3676.70 --> 3677.80]  The dry,
[3678.02 --> 3678.76]  cracked earth
[3678.76 --> 3679.72]  surrounds it,
[3680.18 --> 3680.72]  lifeless
[3680.72 --> 3681.88]  and harsh,
[3682.00 --> 3682.82]  but this garden
[3682.82 --> 3684.22]  stands out,
[3684.36 --> 3685.42]  rich in color,
[3685.82 --> 3686.80]  brimming with life
[3686.80 --> 3687.48]  and fruit
[3687.48 --> 3688.36]  and flowers.
[3689.22 --> 3689.76]  The garden
[3689.76 --> 3690.60]  doesn't blend in
[3690.60 --> 3691.44]  with its surroundings.
[3691.68 --> 3691.94]  In fact,
[3691.98 --> 3693.04]  it contrasts
[3693.04 --> 3694.10]  so hard
[3694.10 --> 3695.30]  with the desolation.
[3696.36 --> 3696.76]  And people
[3696.76 --> 3697.84]  passing by
[3697.84 --> 3699.08]  can't help
[3699.08 --> 3700.02]  but be drawn
[3700.02 --> 3700.94]  to its beauty
[3700.94 --> 3702.40]  and its nourishment.
[3702.40 --> 3705.36]  our going
[3705.36 --> 3706.04]  is to be
[3706.04 --> 3706.58]  that garden
[3706.58 --> 3708.14]  in the desert.
[3709.46 --> 3710.08]  And in a world
[3710.08 --> 3710.98]  that often feels
[3710.98 --> 3711.46]  dry
[3711.46 --> 3712.46]  and lifeless,
[3712.60 --> 3713.70]  full of selfishness
[3713.70 --> 3714.38]  and sin
[3714.38 --> 3715.34]  and despair,
[3715.54 --> 3716.14]  the church
[3716.14 --> 3717.16]  ought to be
[3717.16 --> 3718.40]  one that stands
[3718.40 --> 3719.38]  out as vibrant
[3719.38 --> 3720.50]  and life-giving
[3720.50 --> 3721.40]  community.
[3722.52 --> 3723.20]  And by living
[3723.20 --> 3723.96]  according to
[3723.96 --> 3725.16]  God's values
[3725.16 --> 3726.56]  and as a contrast
[3726.56 --> 3727.28]  into the world,
[3727.36 --> 3728.04]  we offer
[3728.04 --> 3729.16]  the beauty
[3729.16 --> 3730.40]  of the gospel.
[3730.40 --> 3732.64]  we offer
[3732.64 --> 3733.44]  God's life
[3733.44 --> 3734.74]  and his salvation
[3734.74 --> 3735.88]  to those around us.
[3737.66 --> 3738.76]  Just like the garden
[3738.76 --> 3739.54]  doesn't hide
[3739.54 --> 3740.40]  its flourishing
[3740.40 --> 3741.38]  life,
[3742.04 --> 3742.66]  the church's
[3742.66 --> 3743.72]  light and love
[3743.72 --> 3744.98]  stands out
[3744.98 --> 3746.20]  and it draws
[3746.20 --> 3746.90]  others
[3746.90 --> 3747.78]  to the hope
[3747.78 --> 3748.98]  found in
[3748.98 --> 3749.82]  God.
[3752.14 --> 3752.94]  You,
[3754.00 --> 3754.66]  we,
[3755.04 --> 3755.40]  together,
[3756.26 --> 3756.80]  are a
[3756.80 --> 3758.04]  sent community,
[3758.88 --> 3759.76]  sent to
[3759.76 --> 3760.20]  bless
[3760.20 --> 3761.24]  the world,
[3761.66 --> 3762.14]  sent to
[3762.14 --> 3762.98]  reveal
[3762.98 --> 3763.66]  God's
[3763.66 --> 3764.30]  presence,
[3764.50 --> 3764.92]  sent to
[3764.92 --> 3765.54]  show
[3765.54 --> 3766.50]  the way
[3766.50 --> 3767.26]  back to
[3767.26 --> 3767.84]  the Father,
[3767.98 --> 3768.72]  to reveal
[3768.72 --> 3769.54]  the light
[3769.54 --> 3770.18]  of the world,
[3770.38 --> 3771.18]  and sent
[3771.18 --> 3772.48]  as a contrast
[3772.48 --> 3773.32]  so that people
[3773.32 --> 3773.92]  might look
[3773.92 --> 3774.46]  at you
[3774.46 --> 3775.22]  and say,
[3775.80 --> 3777.02]  who is
[3777.02 --> 3778.02]  this God?
[3778.58 --> 3779.68]  Who is
[3779.68 --> 3780.94]  this man?
[3782.52 --> 3783.20]  Why
[3783.20 --> 3784.00]  do you
[3784.00 --> 3784.48]  do
[3784.48 --> 3785.36]  what you
[3785.36 --> 3785.70]  do?
[3785.70 --> 3787.42]  it is
[3787.42 --> 3788.46]  absolutely
[3788.46 --> 3789.70]  weird
[3789.70 --> 3790.68]  and makes
[3790.68 --> 3791.30]  no sense
[3791.30 --> 3791.68]  to me
[3791.68 --> 3792.22]  and yet
[3792.22 --> 3792.52]  there's
[3792.52 --> 3792.88]  something
[3792.88 --> 3793.40]  in my
[3793.40 --> 3793.68]  heart
[3793.68 --> 3794.68]  that sings
[3794.68 --> 3796.18]  when I
[3796.18 --> 3796.50]  hear you
[3796.50 --> 3796.84]  speak.
[3798.74 --> 3799.36]  That's
[3799.36 --> 3799.72]  why we
[3799.72 --> 3799.98]  go.
[3801.10 --> 3801.60]  That's
[3801.60 --> 3802.14]  how we
[3802.14 --> 3802.44]  go.
[3803.82 --> 3804.14]  And
[3804.14 --> 3804.50]  together
[3804.50 --> 3805.22]  I pray
[3805.22 --> 3806.72]  that we
[3806.72 --> 3807.18]  would
[3807.18 --> 3808.00]  go.
[3809.08 --> 3809.56]  Amen?
[3810.86 --> 3811.46]  Amen.
[3811.56 --> 3811.90]  That was a
[3811.90 --> 3812.44]  false ending.
[3812.44 --> 3814.42]  because you
[3814.42 --> 3814.84]  need to say
[3814.84 --> 3815.42]  amen to
[3815.42 --> 3815.68]  yes,
[3815.72 --> 3815.98]  I want
[3815.98 --> 3816.32]  to go.
[3817.50 --> 3817.90]  That's
[3817.90 --> 3818.14]  your
[3818.14 --> 3818.66]  calling.
[3819.66 --> 3819.94]  Don't
[3819.94 --> 3820.26]  look for
[3820.26 --> 3820.66]  me to
[3820.66 --> 3820.94]  do it
[3820.94 --> 3821.36]  for you.
[3821.86 --> 3822.12]  Don't
[3822.12 --> 3822.44]  look for
[3822.44 --> 3822.88]  Kevin to
[3822.88 --> 3823.12]  do it
[3823.12 --> 3823.50]  for you.
[3823.74 --> 3823.94]  Don't
[3823.94 --> 3824.22]  look for
[3824.22 --> 3824.70]  Josh to
[3824.70 --> 3824.92]  do it
[3824.92 --> 3825.22]  for you,
[3825.26 --> 3825.42]  although
[3825.42 --> 3826.22]  Josh does
[3826.22 --> 3826.62]  an excellent
[3826.62 --> 3827.18]  job at
[3827.18 --> 3827.36]  it.
[3827.94 --> 3828.16]  Sorry,
[3828.26 --> 3828.42]  Kevin.
[3830.52 --> 3830.96]  This
[3830.96 --> 3831.56]  is all
[3831.56 --> 3832.50]  of us
[3832.50 --> 3833.94]  sent
[3833.94 --> 3834.86]  to go.
[3836.08 --> 3836.44]  And so
[3836.44 --> 3836.74]  when you
[3836.74 --> 3837.42]  say amen,
[3838.46 --> 3839.04]  know that
[3839.04 --> 3839.54]  you are
[3839.54 --> 3840.30]  going with
[3840.30 --> 3841.00]  God,
[3841.20 --> 3841.84]  who goes
[3841.84 --> 3842.34]  with you
[3842.34 --> 3842.74]  and has
[3842.74 --> 3843.38]  sent you
[3843.38 --> 3843.94]  in the
[3843.94 --> 3844.62]  power of
[3844.62 --> 3845.02]  the Holy
[3845.02 --> 3845.40]  Spirit.
[3847.08 --> 3847.66]  Go
[3847.66 --> 3848.46]  because
[3848.46 --> 3849.10]  he
[3849.10 --> 3849.98]  has
[3849.98 --> 3850.68]  said
[3850.68 --> 3851.48]  go.
[3852.38 --> 3852.96]  And it's
[3852.96 --> 3853.28]  in your
[3853.28 --> 3854.06]  going with
[3854.06 --> 3855.10]  him that
[3855.10 --> 3855.84]  you find
[3855.84 --> 3856.66]  true
[3856.66 --> 3857.66]  life.
[3859.62 --> 3860.32]  And then
[3860.32 --> 3860.62]  I can
[3860.62 --> 3861.10]  promise
[3861.10 --> 3862.80]  as you
[3862.80 --> 3863.10]  go,
[3863.24 --> 3863.56]  you will
[3863.56 --> 3864.56]  see me
[3864.56 --> 3865.64]  and Kevin
[3865.64 --> 3866.36]  and Josh
[3866.36 --> 3866.92]  and I pray
[3866.92 --> 3867.72]  every one
[3867.72 --> 3868.00]  of you
[3868.00 --> 3868.48]  on that
[3868.48 --> 3868.84]  same
[3868.84 --> 3869.52]  journey
[3869.52 --> 3870.40]  together.
[3870.40 --> 3872.14]  now
[3872.14 --> 3872.44]  amen.
[3873.22 --> 3873.84]  Let's
[3873.84 --> 3874.00]  pray
[3874.00 --> 3874.40]  together.
[3876.78 --> 3877.38]  Holy
[3877.38 --> 3877.68]  God,
[3877.78 --> 3878.00]  holy
[3878.00 --> 3878.38]  God,
[3878.70 --> 3879.12]  holy
[3879.12 --> 3879.50]  God,
[3879.84 --> 3880.04]  you
[3880.04 --> 3880.26]  have
[3880.26 --> 3880.62]  made
[3880.62 --> 3881.08]  us
[3881.08 --> 3881.82]  a
[3881.82 --> 3882.22]  royal
[3882.22 --> 3883.06]  priesthood,
[3883.14 --> 3883.70]  a holy
[3883.70 --> 3884.20]  nation,
[3884.34 --> 3884.54]  your
[3884.54 --> 3885.18]  special
[3885.18 --> 3885.94]  possession,
[3886.08 --> 3886.38]  a people
[3886.38 --> 3886.90]  belonging
[3886.90 --> 3887.38]  to you
[3887.38 --> 3887.72]  that we
[3887.72 --> 3887.98]  might
[3887.98 --> 3888.44]  declare
[3888.44 --> 3889.02]  your
[3889.02 --> 3889.52]  praises
[3889.52 --> 3890.12]  and so
[3890.12 --> 3890.44]  now
[3890.44 --> 3890.90]  send
[3890.90 --> 3891.26]  us
[3891.26 --> 3891.58]  out
[3891.58 --> 3892.00]  to
[3892.00 --> 3892.42]  declare
[3892.42 --> 3892.80]  those
[3892.80 --> 3893.24]  praises.
[3893.44 --> 3893.68]  Send
[3893.68 --> 3893.96]  us
[3893.96 --> 3894.18]  out
[3894.18 --> 3894.70]  in the
[3894.70 --> 3895.00]  power
[3895.00 --> 3895.44]  of your
[3895.44 --> 3895.70]  name.
[3896.26 --> 3896.52]  Send
[3896.52 --> 3896.76]  us
[3896.76 --> 3896.98]  out
[3896.98 --> 3897.20]  no
[3897.20 --> 3897.58]  longer
[3897.58 --> 3898.42]  slaves
[3898.42 --> 3898.94]  to
[3898.94 --> 3899.42]  sin
[3899.42 --> 3899.74]  and
[3899.74 --> 3900.56]  brokenness
[3900.56 --> 3900.82]  but
[3900.82 --> 3901.80]  made
[3901.80 --> 3902.30]  new
[3902.30 --> 3902.74]  in
[3902.74 --> 3903.30]  life,
[3903.56 --> 3904.26]  transformed
[3904.26 --> 3905.28]  with the
[3905.28 --> 3905.68]  power
[3905.68 --> 3906.08]  of the
[3906.08 --> 3906.28]  Holy
[3906.28 --> 3906.60]  Spirit
[3906.60 --> 3907.10]  to
[3907.10 --> 3907.96]  declare
[3907.96 --> 3908.50]  your
[3908.50 --> 3909.16]  gospel
[3909.16 --> 3910.12]  truth.
[3911.34 --> 3912.04]  Send
[3912.04 --> 3912.28]  us
[3912.28 --> 3912.52]  out
[3912.52 --> 3912.68]  that
[3912.68 --> 3912.84]  we
[3912.84 --> 3913.14]  might
[3913.14 --> 3913.62]  shine
[3913.62 --> 3913.94]  like
[3913.94 --> 3914.50]  stars
[3914.50 --> 3915.24]  in the
[3915.24 --> 3915.62]  universe
[3915.62 --> 3916.02]  as we
[3916.02 --> 3916.38]  hold
[3916.38 --> 3916.66]  out
[3916.66 --> 3916.88]  the
[3916.88 --> 3917.22]  word
[3917.22 --> 3917.96]  of
[3917.96 --> 3918.74]  life.
[3920.40 --> 3921.06]  God,
[3921.14 --> 3921.26]  your
[3921.26 --> 3921.76]  call
[3921.76 --> 3922.98]  is
[3922.98 --> 3923.24]  about
[3923.24 --> 3923.76]  so
[3923.76 --> 3924.54]  much
[3924.54 --> 3924.98]  more
[3924.98 --> 3925.22]  than
[3925.22 --> 3925.58]  this
[3925.58 --> 3925.98]  moment
[3925.98 --> 3926.30]  right
[3926.30 --> 3926.74]  here.
[3927.56 --> 3928.16]  It's
[3928.16 --> 3928.38]  about
[3928.38 --> 3928.74]  every
[3928.74 --> 3929.18]  moment
[3929.18 --> 3929.90]  from
[3929.90 --> 3930.16]  this
[3930.16 --> 3930.48]  place
[3930.48 --> 3930.76]  going
[3930.76 --> 3931.18]  forward.
[3932.14 --> 3932.24]  And
[3932.24 --> 3932.50]  so,
[3932.56 --> 3932.98]  so
[3932.98 --> 3933.68]  fill
[3933.68 --> 3934.08]  us
[3934.08 --> 3934.32]  with
[3934.32 --> 3934.76]  wonder
[3934.76 --> 3935.02]  that
[3935.02 --> 3935.22]  we
[3935.22 --> 3936.38]  run
[3936.38 --> 3937.46]  headlong
[3937.46 --> 3937.96]  into
[3937.96 --> 3938.26]  the
[3938.26 --> 3938.66]  journey
[3938.66 --> 3939.00]  of
[3939.00 --> 3939.26]  faith
[3939.26 --> 3939.70]  even
[3939.70 --> 3940.08]  though
[3940.08 --> 3940.34]  we
[3940.34 --> 3940.58]  may
[3940.58 --> 3940.84]  not
[3940.84 --> 3941.22]  know
[3941.22 --> 3941.84]  where
[3941.84 --> 3942.02]  you
[3942.02 --> 3942.18]  are
[3942.18 --> 3942.50]  calling
[3942.50 --> 3942.86]  us.
[3944.18 --> 3944.66]  But
[3944.66 --> 3944.76]  we
[3944.76 --> 3944.92]  go
[3944.92 --> 3945.22]  to be
[3945.22 --> 3945.34]  a
[3945.34 --> 3945.64]  blessing.
[3946.48 --> 3946.58]  And
[3946.58 --> 3946.74]  so
[3946.74 --> 3947.02]  bless
[3947.02 --> 3947.18]  us
[3947.18 --> 3947.34]  we
[3947.34 --> 3947.58]  pray
[3947.58 --> 3947.84]  in
[3947.84 --> 3948.14]  Jesus
[3948.14 --> 3948.54]  name.
[3949.14 --> 3949.44]  Amen.
[3951.76 --> 3954.02]  I
[3954.02 --> 3954.20]  think
[3954.20 --> 3954.36]  the
[3954.36 --> 3954.52]  one
[3954.52 --> 3954.74]  thing
[3954.74 --> 3954.92]  that
[3954.92 --> 3955.14]  can
[3955.14 --> 3955.66]  stop
[3955.66 --> 3956.16]  me
[3956.16 --> 3956.56]  anyway
[3956.56 --> 3956.84]  from
[3956.84 --> 3957.20]  going
[3957.20 --> 3957.66]  is
[3957.66 --> 3958.02]  fear.
[3958.92 --> 3959.02]  And
[3959.02 --> 3959.22]  this
[3959.22 --> 3959.54]  song
[3959.54 --> 3959.94]  just
[3959.94 --> 3960.38]  reminds
[3960.38 --> 3960.62]  us
[3960.62 --> 3960.80]  that
[3960.80 --> 3960.98]  we
[3960.98 --> 3961.22]  are
[3961.22 --> 3961.54]  a
[3961.54 --> 3961.80]  child
[3961.80 --> 3962.00]  of
[3962.00 --> 3962.28]  God
[3962.28 --> 3962.72]  that
[3962.72 --> 3963.34]  he
[3963.34 --> 3963.74]  is
[3963.74 --> 3964.70]  all
[3964.70 --> 3965.14]  powerful
[3965.14 --> 3965.44]  and
[3965.44 --> 3965.78]  all
[3965.78 --> 3966.70]  omnipotent
[3966.70 --> 3967.22]  and we
[3967.22 --> 3967.50]  don't
[3967.50 --> 3967.72]  have
[3967.72 --> 3967.92]  to
[3967.92 --> 3968.16]  be
[3968.16 --> 3968.52]  afraid.
[3968.52 --> 3969.14]  Let's
[3969.14 --> 3969.38]  stand
[3969.38 --> 3969.56]  up
[3969.56 --> 3969.74]  and
[3969.74 --> 3969.92]  sing.
[3981.76 --> 4011.76] 
[4011.76 --> 4015.76]  From my enemies
[4015.76 --> 4021.52]  Till all my fears are gone
[4021.52 --> 4028.02]  I'm no longer a slave to fear
[4028.02 --> 4034.80]  I am a child of God
[4034.80 --> 4041.08]  I'm no longer a slave to fear
[4041.08 --> 4047.66]  I am a child of God
[4047.66 --> 4060.16]  From my mother's womb
[4060.16 --> 4063.68]  You have chosen me
[4063.68 --> 4069.16]  Love has called my name
[4069.16 --> 4072.82]  I've been born again
[4072.82 --> 4075.16]  Into your family
[4075.16 --> 4081.66]  Your blood goes through my name
[4081.66 --> 4087.74]  I'm no longer a slave to fear
[4087.74 --> 4094.32]  I am a child of God
[4094.32 --> 4100.46]  I'm no longer a slave to fear
[4100.46 --> 4106.32]  I am a child of God
[4106.32 --> 4124.32]  You slid the sea so I could walk right through it
[4124.32 --> 4128.32]  My fears were drowning for them alone
[4128.32 --> 4134.90]  You rescued me so I could stand and sing
[4134.90 --> 4141.48]  I am a child of God
[4141.48 --> 4147.90]  You slid the sea so I could walk right through it
[4147.90 --> 4151.90]  My fears were drowning in perfect love
[4151.90 --> 4158.48]  You rescued me so I could stand and sing
[4158.48 --> 4163.48]  I am a child of God
[4163.48 --> 4169.48]  I am a child of God
[4169.48 --> 4180.06]  I am a child of God
[4180.06 --> 4184.06]  I am a child of God
[4184.06 --> 4192.64]  I am a child of God
[4192.64 --> 4198.10]  I am no longer a slave to fear
[4198.10 --> 4205.64]  I am a child of God
[4205.64 --> 4219.06]  Amen and amen.
