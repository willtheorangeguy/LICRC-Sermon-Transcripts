[0.00 → 29.98] Thank you.
[30.00 → 59.98] Thank you.
[60.00 → 89.98] Thank you.
[90.00 → 119.98] Thank you.
[120.00 → 149.98] Thank you.
[150.00 → 179.98] Thank you.
[180.00 → 209.98] Thank you.
[210.00 → 239.98] Thank you.
[240.00 → 269.98] Thank you.
[270.00 → 299.98] Thank you.
[300.00 → 329.98] Thank you.
[330.00 → 359.98] Thank you.
[360.00 → 389.98] Thank you.
[390.00 → 419.98] Thank you.
[420.00 → 449.98] Thank you.
[450.00 → 479.96] Thank you.
[479.96 → 509.94] Thank you.
[509.94 → 539.92] Thank you.
[539.94 → 569.92] Thank you.
[570.60 → 572.60] It's treat tag again, Josh.
[572.82 → 574.02] What are we going to do?
[574.52 → 575.94] I have an idea.
[576.42 → 577.46] I don't know, Josh.
[577.82 → 579.66] Last year didn't end so well for you.
[580.20 → 580.74] No, no, no.
[581.42 → 582.70] This one can't go wrong.
[599.92 → 609.94] Welcome to Jurassic Park.
[609.94 → 612.66] Welcome to Jurassic Park.
[612.66 → 612.70] Welcome to Jurassic Park.
[612.70 → 613.70] Welcome to Jurassic Park.
[613.70 → 618.88] I'm not sure if I like this idea, Josh.
[618.88 → 648.86] What's that noise.
[648.88 → 678.86] It's coming.
[678.88 → 708.88] Once again, it's the month of the day,
[708.88 → 712.22] is the day today, the so you're going to, you know,
[712.22 → 717.50] something to give, look up people in the directory, look at people at your church, show up at their
[717.50 → 722.36] doorstep, put it in their mailbox, whatever creative way you can think of, go and tag
[722.36 → 728.52] someone with that treat. And then if you get tagged by someone, pay it forward, go tag
[728.52 → 733.40] one or two or eight other people with a gift or treat.
[733.40 → 739.78] When you tag people, you can choose to do that anonymously. You can choose to do that
[739.78 → 747.22] with a card that says who it's from. You can choose to do that by knocking on the door and running away
[747.22 → 754.18] as they come to open it and find the gift there. Or you can stand and wait and say, treat tag and hand
[754.18 → 759.86] them their box of candy or their bag of books or whatever it is that you are giving.
[759.86 → 766.18] Basically, there are no rules. There are some tags that you can print and use with your treats here at the
[766.18 → 770.90] link below this video, or you can find some in the midweek memo or bulletin as well.
[770.90 → 777.86] So one last time, make sure that you are tagging as many people as you can, but especially those people
[777.86 → 783.62] whom you may not know or haven't yet met, reach out to them. If you're not sure how to connect with
[783.62 → 791.14] people or how to tag someone, you can contact us or the church office, and we will happily get you
[791.14 → 797.38] connected there. And then when you do share, share that online. We want to encourage you this year
[797.38 → 806.18] to use the hashtag LICRA treat tag 24. And that way we'll be able to collect all of those and see the
[806.18 → 814.26] way it's spread around in our community together. In the meantime, I wonder how Josh is doing?
[814.26 → 827.38] guys, this was definitely a bad idea.
[827.38 → 828.02] treat K!
[831.06 → 831.86] man, I'm hungry.
[838.90 → 839.54] treat K!
[844.26 → 855.62] okay, so it is treat tag. Thanks, Linda. If you would like to get started right away, there are some
[855.62 → 862.42] tags on the connect booth. You can grab, take home and use those as you are tagging people. I'm going
[862.42 → 870.90] to invite the worship leaders up front, and we can come together and worship our God. As we gather in
[870.90 → 876.82] worship, we know that God is in this place, and we mark that by receiving his greeting. And so as
[876.82 → 881.38] these come up, I invite you also, if you're able and where you are, to stand.
[886.90 → 893.14] After we receive God's greeting, I invite you to turn to those around you and to greet them in
[893.14 → 897.86] worship this morning. And you can do so in various ways with a handshake or a head nod or a fist bump.
[897.86 → 902.98] If you're not, you can say, peace of Christ be with you or the Lord be with you or welcome. However it is,
[902.98 → 908.02] you are moved to do that. We encourage you just to welcome everyone into this space. Receive the greeting
[908.02 → 915.46] of God. Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ,
[915.46 → 922.34] Son and our Saviour, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[927.86 → 942.18] Same if Gina Panel from someone.
[944.26 → 948.34] Isn't that safe?
[948.34 → 950.66] Target from,
[950.66 → 951.70] especially when it comes in.
[951.70 → 973.28] is from Psalm 145.
[974.40 → 977.36] I will exalt you, my God the King.
[977.66 → 980.16] I will praise your name forever and ever.
[980.16 → 984.18] Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise.
[984.54 → 986.72] His greatness no one can fathom.
[987.46 → 990.46] One generation commends your works to another.
[990.90 → 992.90] They tell of your mighty acts.
[994.08 → 998.12] This passage for the call to worship this morning
[998.12 → 1001.18] is fitting as we celebrate God's faithfulness
[1001.18 → 1006.54] in witnessing the number of generations of past and present
[1006.54 → 1009.40] and future gems worshipping here today.
[1010.16 → 1015.76] So I'm going to ask this question to all the current gems and leaders
[1015.76 → 1019.40] and also any past gems or Calvinists or leaders.
[1019.92 → 1021.82] So what does the Lord require of you?
[1022.08 → 1026.64] To act justly, to love mercy, to walk humbly with your God.
[1026.80 → 1028.82] Micah 6 verse 8.
[1028.82 → 1028.86] Micah 6 verse 8.
[1028.86 → 1035.92] Let's worship together.
[1035.92 → 1054.56] You give life.
[1054.56 → 1055.56] You are love.
[1055.56 → 1057.56] You bring life.
[1057.56 → 1060.68] You bring life to the darkness.
[1060.68 → 1062.56] You give up.

[1183.94 → 1189.08] And all the earth will shout your praise
[1189.08 → 1193.54] Our hearts will cry, these bones will sing
[1193.54 → 1200.14] Wake up, you Lord

[1301.94 → 1305.10] To declare the law and prophets
[1305.10 → 1308.86] To a virgin came the word

[2314.52 → 2319.98] I will follow you.
[2319.98 → 2321.98] Oh
[2349.98 → 2351.90] a
[2379.98 → 2389.14] Hello, my name is Courtney, and I'm the coordinator for the Langley Emanuel CRC GEMS program.
[2389.62 → 2394.50] GEMS stands for Girls Everywhere Meeting the Saviour, and its vision is to see girls around
[2394.50 → 2399.00] the world actively and enthusiastically expressing love for God and for others.
[2399.60 → 2403.90] Girls equipped, motivated, and passionately engaged in living out their faith.
[2404.42 → 2409.02] The mission of GEMS is to bring girls everywhere into a living dynamic relationship with Jesus
[2409.02 → 2415.46] Christ. Langley Emanuel GEMS does this through Bible study, badges, crafts, songs, having
[2415.46 → 2421.16] conversations, and so much more. We currently have 10 leaders and 40 girls, ranging in ages
[2421.16 → 2427.26] from grade 3 to grade 7. This year the theme has been Rise Up, which has helped us to explore
[2427.26 → 2432.02] the story of Esther. We have been learning about how God can use an ordinary person to
[2432.02 → 2437.32] do extraordinary things, how Esther was more than an orphan or a pretty face. She was a
[2437.32 → 2441.94] girl who could rise up in faith and stand her ground because she put her hope in God alone.
[2442.72 → 2447.42] But in order for us to trust God, we have to know who he is. We saw part of God's character
[2447.42 → 2453.70] through these five Bible-based truths. God is king. God is our deliverer. God is trustworthy.
[2454.48 → 2460.16] God is always at work. God is with you wherever you go. The girls were reminded to put their faith
[2460.16 → 2463.42] in God through our theme verse this year, which they will share now.
[2463.42 → 2487.48] There is nothing easy about being a girl or living in our world today. We face unique challenges
[2487.48 → 2495.02] and unsustainable pressures in a culture of confusion about who God is and what truth is, or what is truth.
[2495.56 → 2501.46] Sometimes it can feel overwhelming and hopeless, but we gather on this Gem Sunday in the hope of Jesus Christ.
[2501.46 → 2531.44] Jesus Christ.
[2531.44 → 2534.70] Let's learn these five truths about who God is and what he has promised.
[2535.44 → 2537.62] God is king.
[2538.52 → 2540.84] The Lord is my God.
[2541.52 → 2543.90] The great king over all the earth.
[2544.64 → 2546.72] Psalm 47, verse 2.
[2548.14 → 2550.44] God is our deliverer.
[2551.94 → 2553.62] The Lord is my rock.
[2553.94 → 2556.26] My fortress and my deliverer.
[2556.66 → 2558.42] My God is my rock.
[2558.42 → 2560.42] In whom I take refuge.
[2560.42 → 2563.42] My shield and the horn of my salvation.
[2563.42 → 2565.50] My strong will.
[2565.50 → 2568.04] Psalm 18, verse 2.
[2568.04 → 2571.04] God is trustworthy.
[2571.04 → 2574.04] He is who he says he is.
[2574.04 → 2576.86] And he will do what he says he will do.
[2578.12 → 2581.52] The Lord is trustworthy in all the promises.
[2582.18 → 2584.32] And faithful in all the dust.
[2584.88 → 2587.66] Psalm 145, verse 13.
[2587.66 → 2592.14] God is always at work.
[2592.50 → 2593.58] He is near.
[2594.12 → 2597.80] The Lord is near to all who call on him.
[2598.16 → 2600.06] To all who call on him.
[2601.06 → 2603.96] Psalm 145, verse 13.
[2605.66 → 2608.96] God is with you wherever you go.
[2608.96 → 2611.30] Do not be afraid.
[2611.58 → 2613.20] Do not be discouraged.
[2613.72 → 2617.46] For the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.
[2617.88 → 2619.82] Joshua 1, verse 13.
[2621.22 → 2626.92] Thanks be to the God of hope who renews our strength so that we can rise up in every circumstance.
[2627.46 → 2633.28] Stand secure in our faith and have the confidence that when we put our hope in him, we will be okay.
[2633.28 → 2634.22] No matter what.
[2638.96 → 2658.94] Tell me the story of the girl without a mother.
[2658.94 → 2662.38] Of the girl without a father.
[2662.80 → 2665.22] Who found favour with the king.
[2665.22 → 2668.84] Tell me again.
[2669.24 → 2672.30] About how he beheld her beauty.
[2672.58 → 2675.74] About the way she stepped out bravely.
[2675.94 → 2678.34] All her life an offering.
[2679.84 → 2682.64] She fell to her knees.
[2683.76 → 2686.00] While she begged him, please.
[2686.68 → 2688.32] To spare my people.
[2688.84 → 2691.52] Or set them free or king.
[2692.22 → 2694.08] Give them a merit.
[2694.08 → 2695.64] To spare belonging.
[2695.64 → 2698.96] To a kingdom that is coming.
[2699.52 → 2702.34] With the song they'll keep on singing.
[2702.82 → 2705.60] With the bells they'll keep on ringing.
[2706.14 → 2709.08] Oh, I'm swept up in a story.
[2709.50 → 2711.96] All that I don't want to miss.
[2712.34 → 2714.94] So I will rise up.
[2714.94 → 2717.30] For such a time is late.
[2717.30 → 2718.04] Tell me again.
[2718.04 → 2726.04] Tell me again.
[2726.04 → 2729.00] What a god man come from glory.
[2729.00 → 2732.32] Why they said he had no beauty.
[2732.32 → 2735.46] He was the flavour of the king.
[2736.84 → 2738.98] Tell me again.
[2739.22 → 2742.30] About the way he loved the lonely.
[2742.72 → 2745.56] Healed the sick and fed the hungry.
[2745.56 → 2748.52] All his life an offering.
[2748.52 → 2752.36] He hung on a tree.
[2752.36 → 2753.72] He cried.
[2753.72 → 2755.48] Oh, fall and flee.
[2756.48 → 2758.36] Slay all people.
[2759.12 → 2760.40] Oh, set them free.
[2762.12 → 2764.04] Give them a merit.
[2764.04 → 2768.82] To a kingdom that is coming.
[2768.82 → 2772.14] It's the song they'll keep on singing.
[2772.58 → 2775.46] It's the bells they'll keep on ringing.
[2776.00 → 2779.04] They'll be swept up in a story.
[2779.48 → 2782.10] Oh, that they don't want to miss.
[2782.42 → 2784.92] So I will rise up.
[2784.92 → 2787.34] Oh, such a time is late.
[2789.44 → 2792.36] Oh, and he is able.
[2792.92 → 2795.60] We have a place here at the table.
[2796.12 → 2798.66] Our deliverance has come.
[2798.66 → 2802.16] His steadfast love will bring us home.
[2802.62 → 2805.58] He holds all things together.
[2805.96 → 2808.88] We already have his favour.
[2809.30 → 2812.32] We'll give honest, surrendered years.
[2812.32 → 2818.86] Because of all his faithfulness.
[2820.16 → 2822.26] Tell me a story.
[2822.56 → 2825.56] About the way I'm loved completely.
[2825.88 → 2828.88] Because your beauty is my cover.
[2829.22 → 2831.92] I have a favour of the king.
[2833.50 → 2835.52] Tell me again.
[2835.90 → 2839.02] About how I can stand up only.
[2839.02 → 2842.38] I will heed the things you've told me.
[2842.60 → 2845.10] And make my life and my soul.
[2845.90 → 2849.26] So I, oh, so my need.
[2849.52 → 2852.68] So I, beg your father please.
[2853.02 → 2855.56] Set all your people free.
[2856.12 → 2858.74] Help us live what we believe.
[2859.00 → 2862.26] We have a merit in belonging.
[2862.26 → 2865.60] To a kingdom that is coming.
[2866.10 → 2868.76] It's the song we'll keep on singing.
[2869.46 → 2872.06] It's the bells we'll keep on ringing.
[2872.74 → 2875.72] We'll be swept up in a story.
[2876.18 → 2878.72] Oh, do we all want to miss?
[2878.96 → 2881.52] So we will rise up.
[2881.52 → 2884.42] Such a time in our place.
[2885.86 → 2888.98] Oh, we're swept up in a story.
[2888.98 → 2892.04] All that we don't want to miss.
[2892.38 → 2894.96] So we will rise up.
[2895.28 → 2897.82] Such a time in our place.
[2897.82 → 2901.78] Oh, oh, oh.
[2901.78 → 2904.54] Oh, oh, oh.
[2904.54 → 2916.62] All right.

[2919.94 → 2923.18] The second offering is for the GEMS Ministry of North America.
[2923.28 → 2929.04] This money is used to run GEMS on a larger scale, to help develop curriculum, to provide
[2929.04 → 2933.38] staff support for the various clubs, and to help spread the word about GEMS.
[2933.38 → 2935.14] And to help set up new clubs.

[2938.02 → 2947.44] From rejected to accepted.
[2947.44 → 2953.16] From forgotten to remembered.
[2954.16 → 2958.78] From the victim to the victor.

[3187.66 → 3189.66] Write your story
[3189.66 → 3191.66] Write your story
[3191.66 → 3193.66] Come on and write your story
[3193.66 → 3195.66] Come on and write your story
[3195.66 → 3197.66] I'm an open book
[3197.66 → 3199.66] I'm an empty place
[3199.66 → 3201.66] I'm an empty place
[3201.66 → 3203.66] I'm an empty place
[3203.66 → 3205.66] I'm an empty place
[3205.66 → 3207.66] I'm an empty place
[3207.66 → 3209.66] I'm an empty place
[3209.66 → 3211.66] We have to have many kids here
[3211.66 → 3213.66] Who are age 3 up to grade 4
[3213.66 → 3215.66] To join us at the front
[3215.66 → 3217.66] Before we head off to children's worship time
[3217.66 → 3219.66] In the back
[3219.66 → 3221.66] And if you're visiting with us
[3221.66 → 3223.66] And have kids in that age group
[3223.66 → 3225.66] They're welcome to come up here
[3225.66 → 3227.66] Or follow us as we leave
[3227.66 → 3229.66] And join us in our worship together
[3229.66 → 3231.66] Back in the other rooms
[3231.66 → 3233.66] Good morning
[3233.66 → 3235.66] Oh that was nice and loud
[3235.66 → 3240.66] I'm wondering if you guys can think of anything
[3240.66 → 3242.66] That you know is real
[3242.66 → 3244.66] But that you can't see
[3244.66 → 3249.66] Something you know is real
[3249.66 → 3251.66] But that you can't see with your eyes
[3251.66 → 3253.66] Like that might be invisible
[3253.66 → 3255.66] Something in like in the world
[3255.66 → 3259.66] We do know Jesus is real, yes
[3259.66 → 3260.66] And we can't see him
[3260.66 → 3262.66] But something else
[3262.66 → 3263.66] Can anyone think of anything?
[3263.66 → 3265.66] Can anyone think of anything?
[3265.66 → 3266.66] No?
[3266.66 → 3267.66] It's a kind of hard question
[3267.66 → 3269.66] Okay, I have one
[3269.66 → 3271.66] What about the wind?
[3271.66 → 3273.66] Have you ever seen the wind?
[3273.66 → 3276.66] So how do we know the wind is real
[3276.66 → 3278.66] If we can't see it?
[3278.66 → 3279.66] Haley?
[3279.66 → 3280.66] We can feel it?
[3280.66 → 3283.66] Yeah, how else can we know the wind is real?
[3285.66 → 3286.66] You can hear it sometimes
[3286.66 → 3287.66] If it's really loud
[3287.66 → 3288.66] It might make a loud noise
[3288.66 → 3291.66] Yeah, we can see it blowing in the trees
[3291.66 → 3293.66] Today we're going to
[3293.66 → 3294.66] In children's worship time
[3294.66 → 3295.66] We're going to be talking about
[3295.66 → 3298.66] How sometimes it's hard to believe in things
[3298.66 → 3299.66] That we can't see
[3299.66 → 3301.66] And there's a person in the Bible named Thomas
[3301.66 → 3304.66] And he had a hard time believing something
[3304.66 → 3305.66] That he couldn't see
[3305.66 → 3307.66] And we're going to see what we can learn
[3307.66 → 3308.66] From Jesus
[3308.66 → 3309.66] About Jesus from that story
[3309.66 → 3311.66] So we're going to stand up
[3311.66 → 3313.66] And we're going to have to be nice and loud today
[3313.66 → 3315.66] Because lots of our big kids aren't here
[3315.66 → 3316.66] For gems
[3316.66 → 3317.66] For gems
[3317.66 → 3318.66] And we're going to do our blessings
[3318.66 → 3320.66] So I invite everyone to stand up with us
[3320.66 → 3321.66] While we bless you
[3321.66 → 3322.66] And receive your blessing
[3322.66 → 3323.66] And receive your blessing
[3323.66 → 3325.66] Thank you
[3325.66 → 3352.60] Good morning, everyone.
[3352.60 → 3356.34] My name is Ken. I am one of the elders here at Emanuel Church.
[3357.30 → 3362.04] First off, it's so great seeing all you gems here and all the participation in this service.
[3362.04 → 3365.52] It's really amazing, the offering and the welcome we got.
[3365.72 → 3370.22] And the praise team up here is really cool seeing you guys joining in and leading us in worship.
[3370.36 → 3371.50] So thank you so much for that.
[3372.32 → 3375.56] Just a couple of announcements I have from the council.
[3376.06 → 3382.28] We have a council meeting this week, so I ask you to uphold that in prayer as we seek to do God's work in our church council.
[3382.60 → 3392.50] And it's also entering the last week and day for our nominations for the upcoming new office bearers that we're looking for.
[3392.60 → 3405.32] So we ask you to continue to prayerfully seek out nominating individuals that you think would be called into that work for our church and for God.
[3405.32 → 3412.50] And if you yourself are still feeling called as well, please be sure to get those nominations in very shortly.
[3412.68 → 3419.48] There is a form that should be available at the Connect booth as well as they've been emailed and accessible through our e-bulletin.
[3420.82 → 3424.28] Additionally, next week, Sunday, we will be celebrating Lord's Supper.
[3424.28 → 3432.34] So take this week to prepare your hearts and to prepare for gathering together around the Lord's table.
[3433.16 → 3437.64] So at this point, I'd like to lead us in our time of prayer as a congregation.
[3438.58 → 3439.34] Let's pray.
[3439.34 → 3444.94] Lord our God, as we sang this morning, you give life.
[3445.54 → 3446.16] You are love.
[3446.86 → 3448.48] You bring light to our darkness.
[3449.38 → 3450.00] You give hope.
[3450.64 → 3452.84] And you restore every heart that is broken.
[3453.46 → 3454.76] Great are you, Lord.
[3455.54 → 3460.46] We pour out our praise to you this morning, Lord, and humbly bring our requests to you.
[3460.46 → 3465.34] We praise you, Lord, for the gift of our children who are a heritage from the Lord.
[3465.92 → 3467.34] We pray for parents.
[3467.78 → 3470.94] Help us to teach our kids to know you through your word.
[3471.64 → 3476.12] We thank you for girls everywhere meeting the Saviour as we celebrate the gems today.
[3476.88 → 3482.14] And we praise you, Lord, for the work and dedication of the counsellors and ask your blessing on them and their work.
[3483.74 → 3485.86] Lord, we pray for new young parents.
[3485.86 → 3489.96] We lift Joanna and Mike and their two-week-old baby, McKenna.
[3491.04 → 3495.40] We also pray for those whose life stories include struggles with infertility.
[3495.92 → 3500.72] Lord, we pray that you bless medical treatments that are being taken for infertility.
[3501.34 → 3505.12] And we pray for your blessing for those who are on journeys toward adoption.
[3506.52 → 3512.50] And today, Lord, in addition to Gem Sunday, we get to hear from the Mexico team who returned two weeks ago
[3512.50 → 3515.56] and will share the work you did in them and through them.
[3516.56 → 3519.50] May the seeds that were sown and relationships that were cultivated
[3519.50 → 3521.96] produce a fruitful harvest for your kingdom, Lord.
[3522.96 → 3528.26] We ask that you work through our missionaries who you have called to go out and spread the gospel.
[3528.90 → 3535.58] And likewise, Lord, please work through the rest of us who you have called to spread the gospel within our communities at home.
[3535.58 → 3541.66] Lord, we lift those in our congregation and those we know with various health concerns.
[3542.44 → 3543.38] Heal our diseases.
[3544.42 → 3549.72] We think of Grace Aberdeen's mom who had an angioplasty done last week, and we pray for her recovery.
[3549.72 → 3556.26] We also uphold to you, Lord, Matthew and Rachel Skipper and their kids as Rachel's health continues to decline.
[3556.86 → 3560.60] Lord, we ask for your miraculous healing hand on Rachel and the family.
[3561.70 → 3567.10] We pray for Kobe Deborah as she's ongoing cancer treatments and is presently at home.
[3567.76 → 3572.34] Help their young family feel your nearness in this time and bring Kobe healing recovery.
[3572.34 → 3578.64] We lift those who have various struggles with mental health, anxiety, and depression.
[3579.18 → 3583.94] Lord, when we are weary and burdened, draw us to you, and you will give us rest.
[3584.62 → 3592.26] Transform us, Lord, by the renewing of our minds and help us cast all our anxiety on you because you care for us.
[3593.52 → 3596.24] We pray, too, for those who are in seasons of mourning.
[3596.98 → 3600.80] We lift Karen Walker as she mourns the passing of her husband Kevin last week.
[3600.80 → 3606.38] And we also pray that you give Rosita all she needs to walk alongside her friend Karen in this time.
[3607.56 → 3615.76] We pray for all who mourn the loss of loved ones, having just celebrated Easter without a loved one for the first time or maybe many times over again.
[3616.70 → 3626.28] Help the Easter resurrection truth comfort us in knowing that death has lost its sting and been swallowed up in the victory we have in our Lord Jesus Christ.
[3626.28 → 3631.08] Lord, we pray for our church and ministries here at Emanuel CRC.
[3631.86 → 3635.32] Bless the work of the staff, volunteers, and council members.
[3635.98 → 3638.94] Lead them to hear your will and direction for your church.
[3640.00 → 3643.64] We pray for your hand on the council nomination process that is underway.
[3644.36 → 3649.16] Stir in the hearts of those you are calling to the noble task of serving your church.
[3649.16 → 3658.26] We pray for each of us this week as we examine ourselves and prepare our hearts to gather around your table in communion next week.
[3659.46 → 3666.52] And now, as we open your word and hear your message, we pray that you open the eyes of our hearts, Lord, and help us to see you.
[3667.04 → 3675.34] Help us not merely listen to the word and so deceive ourselves, but help us to really hear it today and to go out doing what it says.
[3675.34 → 3680.54] Help us act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with our God.
[3681.26 → 3689.34] We pray all these things in your most holy name, not because we're worthy, but because you have allowed us to approach your throne of grace with confidence.
[3689.68 → 3691.56] In the name of Jesus Christ, our Saviour.
[3692.10 → 3692.36] Amen.
[3705.34 → 3724.26] As we've already heard, this year the Gems have been taking this theme verse from Isaiah 40, verse 31, sorry,
[3724.62 → 3732.18] and reading the book of Esther and learning the story of Esther through that lens.
[3732.18 → 3736.16] So we're going to do the same thing in our time together this morning.
[3736.24 → 3738.18] So I'm going to begin once again.
[3738.32 → 3751.80] I'll read Isaiah 40, verse 31, and then we will sort of rehearse the story of Esther through the themes of the five truths that the Gems are looking at.
[3751.88 → 3762.16] And so allow me to start with Isaiah 40, verse 31, where we read that those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength.
[3762.18 → 3765.52] They will soar on wings like eagles.
[3765.90 → 3767.92] They will run and not grow weary.
[3768.38 → 3770.52] They will walk and not be faint.
[3770.98 → 3772.30] This is the word of the Lord.
[3775.52 → 3782.58] So you girls, over the course of this year, have been focusing on five truths.
[3782.66 → 3786.94] Now we've heard them, but I'm going to put them on the screen again so you can see them.
[3786.94 → 3792.32] And I've also reordered them slightly for the purposes of this telling of the story.
[3793.24 → 3804.84] But those five truths are God is king, God is trustworthy, God is our deliverer, God is near, and God is with you.
[3804.84 → 3820.54] As we hear these truths again, and as we look at the story of Esther, I want to challenge you, even as we look at particular characters,
[3820.54 → 3833.76] to realize that the story that's told here is first and foremost for the purpose of revealing God who is behind the story.
[3833.76 → 3839.60] But in Esther, that's a particular challenge.
[3840.84 → 3844.78] Because I don't know how many of you have read the book of Esther recently,
[3845.06 → 3851.70] but the book of Esther doesn't mention the name God at all.
[3851.70 → 3858.92] The word God and its various forms of God's names are not used.
[3860.34 → 3865.12] God is not a character on the surface of the story of Esther.
[3865.60 → 3872.72] And so how can we learn these truths about who God is from a story that seemingly doesn't even mention him?
[3873.88 → 3877.84] That's the challenge that's kind of in front of us this morning.
[3877.84 → 3884.58] Those are the kinds of questions that the story of Esther invites us to ask.
[3886.04 → 3888.48] Because throughout the whole book, there isn't one mention of God.
[3888.82 → 3891.12] His name doesn't appear at all.
[3893.28 → 3895.76] And here's why I think this matters for us this morning.
[3896.94 → 3903.26] Because it's so easy in our own lives and in our own stories, right, to not see God.
[3904.40 → 3906.46] And to not know where he is.
[3907.84 → 3910.66] And to not be sure if he's even in the mix at all.
[3912.18 → 3917.00] Esther starts equipping us to understand how he might be.
[3918.90 → 3922.12] Now the book of Esther tells us a particular story.
[3922.22 → 3926.34] And I want to walk you through that story for those of you who aren't as familiar with it.
[3927.12 → 3932.84] The book of Esther tells the story of the people of God who have been taken into exile.
[3933.12 → 3935.90] And they are now in the Persian Empire.
[3935.90 → 3941.68] This is taking place in a city called Susa, which is one of the capitals of the empire at the time.
[3942.42 → 3948.30] And so real quick, after the people leave Egypt, they spent 400 years there in slavery.
[3948.44 → 3949.88] Then you get the story of the Exodus.
[3950.26 → 3953.04] And they cross the Red Sea, the Ten Commandments.
[3953.10 → 3956.44] And then they end up wandering in the wilderness for 40 years.
[3956.44 → 3960.02] After 40 years, they enter the land.
[3960.70 → 3962.18] They take possession of it.
[3962.18 → 3967.02] They didn't push out the people as they were commanded to.
[3967.24 → 3975.74] And so throughout the next hundreds of years, there's a conflict that continues, that exists.
[3975.84 → 3978.34] And it's a conflict of nations and of peoples.
[3978.34 → 3987.32] But also, there's a conflict that exists within the nation of Israel, that exists within the hearts of the people who live there,
[3987.40 → 3990.68] about whether they will follow God's ways.
[3991.98 → 4000.18] In the time of the judges and in the time of the kings, there are a few examples of people doing right and of leaders doing right.
[4000.18 → 4004.84] But by and large, what is happening is people are doing what's right in their own eyes.
[4005.50 → 4011.16] People are compromising, and they're not living faithfully in relationship to God.
[4012.08 → 4020.42] And so, because of that, God allows his people to be taken into exile in Babylon and Persia.
[4020.98 → 4026.62] The story of Esther happens in the middle of this exile story,
[4026.62 → 4029.74] in the middle of the people being carried away in captivity.
[4030.18 → 4037.22] And so in terms of the whole Bible, for a very short period, the location focus shifts.
[4038.38 → 4040.64] It's kind of a story within a story.
[4041.50 → 4047.34] And because of that, Esther offers for us a unique perspective to reflect on,
[4047.50 → 4050.82] and a unique way of seeing God at work in the world.
[4052.28 → 4056.62] The Persian Empire stretched from India to Ethiopia.
[4056.62 → 4064.98] And the story begins when Xerxes, who is king, summons his queen, Vashti,
[4065.48 → 4069.96] to appear before his officials and to show her beauty.
[4071.08 → 4075.88] Now Vashti does the unthinkable, and she defies the king.
[4075.88 → 4082.22] Right, the king, who's powerful in the world, cannot rule his own home.
[4082.94 → 4086.88] And so if you read the story, he becomes humiliated and angry.
[4087.24 → 4092.30] He listens to some counsellors that he has, and he deposes Vashti from her throne.
[4092.30 → 4098.64] And he issues a decree that throughout the empire, all women should honour their husbands.
[4100.34 → 4103.88] So he was a scorned man by his wife.
[4104.80 → 4106.88] And then again, the location shifts.
[4107.68 → 4112.40] After the power and the pride of the king are revealed to the readers,
[4112.66 → 4115.90] the main characters of the story, as it will continue, are introduced.
[4115.90 → 4122.10] We meet a woman named Harass, who is also called Esther.
[4122.88 → 4127.86] She's a Jewish woman living outside the realm of the Jews
[4127.86 → 4130.72] because she was part of the people carried into exile,
[4130.96 → 4133.86] and her uncle named Mordecai.
[4135.10 → 4140.10] Now Mordecai tells her not to reveal to the king and to the council
[4140.10 → 4143.70] that she is Jewish because the king, in looking for a new wife,
[4143.76 → 4150.04] has called for a beauty contest that he might find a new wife,
[4150.04 → 4153.06] or at least another one to add to his collection of wives.
[4156.02 → 4163.78] And throughout the immediate events of a seemingly random story,
[4163.78 → 4169.50] a plot is actually being skilfully crafted.
[4170.10 → 4177.04] And by chapter 3, the plot thickens with the introduction of a man named Haman.
[4178.26 → 4184.02] Now Haman is promoted to effectively like prime minister in the king's court, right?
[4184.08 → 4186.62] And an honour that in the story, as you're reading it,
[4186.66 → 4190.10] you might expect to go to Mordecai, but it doesn't.
[4191.80 → 4194.50] So if chapter 2, when we read these first characters,
[4194.68 → 4198.66] raises the question about where, whether Jews can live in a foreign land
[4198.66 → 4204.76] and how they might, chapter 3 in the raising of Haman brings this tension to a head.
[4205.42 → 4210.30] Haman is described in chapter 3 as an Aggie,
[4211.16 → 4216.50] which is a term that scholars have argued connects him back to the Malecite,
[4216.96 → 4220.78] which is the historic enemy of Israel from the time of the Exodus.
[4220.78 → 4226.64] When Israel left the Exodus, they were harried and had to fight the Malecite all along.
[4226.74 → 4230.56] And all throughout Israel's history, the Malecite are a thorn in their side.
[4230.66 → 4237.08] And so they become representative of all the enemies that they face.
[4237.44 → 4241.78] And so here is Haman connected to the Malecite, an enemy of Israel.
[4241.78 → 4250.86] Haman gets angry and boils over because Mordecai refused to bow down in his presence.
[4251.96 → 4256.88] So Mordecai is doing to Haman, in a sense, what Vashti first did to Xerxes.
[4257.34 → 4261.94] And as a result, Haman turns his wrath not just against Mordecai,
[4262.08 → 4265.16] but against all the Jews, all the people of God.
[4265.16 → 4272.82] And so you have this man who represents the historic enmity towards God's people,
[4273.56 → 4278.72] and he brings that enmity on the whole of the people who are in exile
[4278.72 → 4284.50] by casting lots, throwing dice to determine how he will destroy them.
[4286.26 → 4290.66] Now, Haman plots and fools the king into following along with this plan,
[4290.66 → 4293.94] but the king doesn't yet realize that by doing so,
[4293.94 → 4296.74] he's going to end up killing his new wife.
[4298.20 → 4304.12] And as the edict to destroy the people of God goes out and around Susa and around the empire,
[4304.90 → 4306.74] Mordecai tears his clothes.
[4308.12 → 4310.96] He puts on traditional mourning sackcloth and ashes,
[4311.16 → 4317.22] and he goes to Esther, who's now in the queen's court,
[4317.66 → 4321.70] living there in the home of the king.
[4321.70 → 4327.98] And he tells her that she has a responsibility for her people,
[4328.20 → 4331.56] a responsibility to protect them and to speak to the king.
[4332.22 → 4336.20] And Esther says, if I go speak to the king, unbidden by him,
[4336.34 → 4340.00] if I go without him asking me to come, he will kill me.
[4340.52 → 4341.34] That's what he does.
[4341.34 → 4346.36] And Mordecai says, you will be killed regardless.
[4347.66 → 4348.36] You are Jewish.
[4348.52 → 4350.10] You can't keep that secret forever.
[4350.50 → 4354.30] Either you will die in the throne room or with the rest of your people.
[4354.30 → 4357.56] But maybe you can save us all.
[4357.56 → 4360.80] And then Mordecai says,
[4360.80 → 4363.64] for if you remain silent at this time,
[4364.00 → 4367.40] relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place,
[4367.94 → 4371.12] but you and your father's family will perish.
[4372.50 → 4376.64] Now, interestingly, this is the one place in the story
[4376.64 → 4382.06] where it seems that there's even a veiled reference to God, right?
[4382.06 → 4385.50] That deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place.
[4385.60 → 4388.70] And so scholars have debated, is this, is they talking about God?
[4388.74 → 4390.40] Because God is deliverer.
[4390.42 → 4392.40] That's a word that's regularly used about him.
[4392.42 → 4394.38] But again, he's just not mentioned.
[4395.96 → 4397.56] And it continues to debate.
[4397.66 → 4400.50] It's a vague reference at best,
[4400.50 → 4407.00] but perhaps all Mordecai knows is that God will protect his people.
[4407.56 → 4411.64] He doesn't know how or where or if or when,
[4412.36 → 4414.76] just that he has.
[4415.82 → 4418.38] And then Mordecai adds his own reference.
[4418.54 → 4420.20] He says, and who knows,
[4420.66 → 4425.68] but that you have come to royal position for such a time as this.
[4425.68 → 4433.76] And that is the line from the story of Esther that people hang on to, right?
[4433.84 → 4436.64] For such a time as this.
[4437.88 → 4440.36] Maybe everything that's happened to you
[4440.36 → 4443.06] was so that you could be right here,
[4444.12 → 4446.52] right now, at this moment,
[4446.88 → 4449.42] able to save all of these lives.
[4449.52 → 4451.44] Maybe every struggle and every worry,
[4451.44 → 4456.46] every fight was to prepare you for this battle.
[4456.98 → 4460.12] Maybe every tear, every hurt, every pain
[4460.12 → 4463.70] was in order to get you to this place.
[4464.60 → 4466.58] Maybe every seeming failure,
[4466.98 → 4469.02] every time it just didn't work out,
[4469.12 → 4471.48] every setback was to make sure
[4471.48 → 4475.00] that you wouldn't miss this opportunity.
[4476.50 → 4477.92] And I want to suggest to you
[4477.92 → 4480.42] that this is why we have the book of Esther.
[4481.44 → 4482.76] To think like that.
[4483.06 → 4484.22] To ask these questions.
[4485.06 → 4486.18] Because it's still true
[4486.18 → 4490.30] that the Bible reveals the action of God in history.
[4490.46 → 4493.58] And that the Bible is the true story of the whole world.
[4493.66 → 4495.62] And the Bible is teaching us about the nature
[4495.62 → 4497.22] and the character of God.
[4497.56 → 4499.24] And Esther is now,
[4499.46 → 4502.92] the story of Esther is broadening our understanding
[4502.92 → 4507.88] to include times even when God doesn't seem present.
[4508.00 → 4510.26] Even when we don't acknowledge God,
[4510.26 → 4512.04] He's still working.
[4512.04 → 4515.02] He's still making His will come about.
[4516.28 → 4517.82] Or more pointedly,
[4518.46 → 4522.66] even when we refuse to name His presence,
[4523.54 → 4524.88] He is still present.
[4526.64 → 4530.84] Even when we can't see the main action,
[4531.04 → 4533.58] we can know because of stories like Esther
[4533.58 → 4535.72] that God is the main actor.
[4535.72 → 4539.02] Even when things seem to be going wrong
[4539.02 → 4542.38] and life is just hanging in this tenuous balance,
[4542.84 → 4544.24] God is still present
[4544.24 → 4548.94] and guiding His history for His glory.
[4548.94 → 4554.22] And that's because God is king.
[4554.58 → 4558.84] That's the first truth that the gems have been looking at.
[4558.90 → 4561.48] And the story of Esther isn't just a contest
[4561.48 → 4563.66] between Xerxes and the people of God.
[4563.72 → 4566.16] This is a contest of kings.
[4566.72 → 4570.08] Xerxes and the true king of God's people
[4570.08 → 4570.90] and of the world.
[4570.90 → 4573.08] And so in this story,
[4573.50 → 4575.72] who is it that orchestrated the exile
[4575.72 → 4577.24] to take place in the first place?
[4578.44 → 4579.04] God did.
[4580.14 → 4583.26] God orchestrated that Harass, Esther,
[4583.62 → 4585.30] would be in the right place
[4585.30 → 4587.24] at the right time for her people.
[4587.90 → 4588.74] God did that.
[4590.20 → 4593.54] Kings in this world rule cities and empires.
[4593.54 → 4596.06] God is king of this world.
[4596.82 → 4597.64] He rules it all.
[4598.58 → 4600.34] Nothing happens without His will
[4600.34 → 4601.60] and without His purpose.
[4603.04 → 4605.42] And because God is king,
[4606.06 → 4608.54] even when you can't see Him,
[4609.42 → 4611.48] His action, His reign,
[4611.74 → 4613.40] is happening all around you.
[4613.90 → 4616.44] History is the servant of God.
[4616.54 → 4618.72] It moves at His direction.
[4618.90 → 4621.06] That's what it means that God is king.
[4621.06 → 4624.66] In fact,
[4626.22 → 4631.66] only if God is king
[4631.66 → 4634.92] does any of this,
[4635.22 → 4636.38] the story in Esther,
[4636.48 → 4637.28] but also this,
[4637.40 → 4640.12] any of this make sense.
[4641.26 → 4642.08] What I mean is that
[4642.08 → 4645.00] only if God is king
[4645.00 → 4647.26] can any of our life
[4647.26 → 4648.50] and our doing
[4648.50 → 4650.62] and our activity have purpose.
[4650.62 → 4652.78] Only if God is king
[4652.78 → 4654.64] can any of your suffering
[4654.64 → 4656.06] or you're struggling
[4656.06 → 4658.06] or the hardships that you face
[4658.06 → 4659.74] have a meaning behind them.
[4660.46 → 4662.06] If God isn't king,
[4662.24 → 4663.46] if God isn't sovereign,
[4663.66 → 4665.22] if He isn't in control
[4665.22 → 4667.06] of history
[4667.06 → 4668.56] and of everything that happens
[4668.56 → 4669.50] in this world,
[4669.66 → 4672.80] that means you can never be sure,
[4673.44 → 4674.92] you can never have any confidence
[4674.92 → 4677.46] that what you are facing in life
[4677.46 → 4679.08] or that what you are doing in life
[4679.08 → 4681.52] has any purpose at all,
[4682.74 → 4682.88] right,
[4682.90 → 4684.44] or that any of it is part of a plan.
[4685.10 → 4686.04] At best,
[4686.44 → 4687.54] if God isn't king,
[4687.68 → 4689.00] it's just a guessing game.
[4691.10 → 4692.80] You can never be sure
[4692.80 → 4695.32] that what happens to you
[4695.32 → 4698.02] is meaningful.
[4698.02 → 4701.70] The only thing you can be sure of,
[4701.76 → 4702.14] actually,
[4702.14 → 4704.00] is that it might be meaningless.
[4704.90 → 4706.40] It might all be purposeless.
[4707.56 → 4709.40] And, honestly,
[4710.14 → 4712.42] if any of our struggle
[4712.42 → 4713.22] is meaningless,
[4713.76 → 4715.20] if any of the things
[4715.20 → 4716.40] that we face in this life
[4716.40 → 4717.30] are meaningless,
[4718.46 → 4721.84] why even bother doing life?
[4722.66 → 4724.02] Why even bother enduring?
[4724.02 → 4724.58] But,
[4724.58 → 4728.22] what Esther is saying
[4728.22 → 4730.56] is that God is king.
[4731.20 → 4732.28] God is king.
[4732.40 → 4733.80] He does have a purpose
[4733.80 → 4734.96] and He does have a plan.
[4735.26 → 4735.56] And yet,
[4735.70 → 4736.90] you may not see it.
[4738.40 → 4739.86] You may not even see Him.
[4741.02 → 4742.06] But, like Esther,
[4742.56 → 4743.66] you can know
[4743.66 → 4745.02] that He's done it.
[4745.74 → 4746.60] You can know
[4746.60 → 4748.42] that He has a plan,
[4748.50 → 4749.84] that He has a purpose.
[4749.96 → 4750.52] Like Esther,
[4750.52 → 4751.52] you can know
[4751.52 → 4752.66] that someone,
[4753.44 → 4755.18] that He is somewhere.
[4756.02 → 4756.70] That someone,
[4756.96 → 4757.68] namely God,
[4757.76 → 4759.20] is in control.
[4759.34 → 4760.24] And, like Esther,
[4761.12 → 4762.08] you can trust Him.
[4763.12 → 4764.32] That's the second truth
[4764.32 → 4765.66] of this story,
[4765.70 → 4767.26] that God is trustworthy.
[4767.52 → 4768.72] And it comes immediately
[4768.72 → 4769.62] out of the fact
[4769.62 → 4770.46] that God is king.
[4771.42 → 4772.84] And it comes out of the fact
[4772.84 → 4773.80] that He is holy
[4773.80 → 4774.56] and good
[4774.56 → 4775.74] and beautiful.
[4776.58 → 4777.22] That God is,
[4777.44 → 4778.62] the Latin phrase is,
[4778.72 → 4779.76] the sunup bonus,
[4779.76 → 4781.30] the ultimate good,
[4781.42 → 4782.28] the ultimate true,
[4782.40 → 4783.40] the ultimate beautiful.
[4784.00 → 4784.96] And over and over
[4784.96 → 4785.70] and over again
[4785.70 → 4786.32] in the Bible,
[4786.60 → 4788.14] we read how God
[4788.14 → 4789.76] remembers His people.
[4790.46 → 4791.36] We read how God
[4791.36 → 4792.16] comes alongside
[4792.16 → 4793.30] of His people.
[4793.44 → 4794.24] We read how God
[4794.24 → 4795.44] hears His people
[4795.44 → 4796.96] when they cry out to Him.
[4797.22 → 4798.64] Even when His people
[4798.64 → 4799.58] do what is right
[4799.58 → 4800.50] in their own eyes.
[4800.64 → 4801.90] Even when they are
[4801.90 → 4803.10] more ruled by sin
[4803.10 → 4804.18] than they are by Him.
[4804.54 → 4806.04] Even in these moments,
[4806.18 → 4807.76] God never forgets
[4807.76 → 4809.86] His people
[4809.86 → 4811.94] because that's who He is.
[4812.94 → 4813.70] And that's why
[4813.70 → 4814.32] He's trustworthy.
[4816.44 → 4817.38] Now, I want to illustrate
[4817.38 → 4818.04] this point.
[4818.56 → 4819.10] And to do that,
[4819.12 → 4819.44] I'm going to need
[4819.44 → 4820.14] a couple volunteers.
[4821.04 → 4821.80] So I'm going to need
[4821.80 → 4823.30] one GEMS girl
[4823.30 → 4825.24] to come to the front.
[4827.04 → 4828.08] Someone who hasn't been
[4828.08 → 4829.28] on stage yet this morning.
[4830.04 → 4831.16] Amara, you want to come up?
[4831.58 → 4832.10] Thank you.
[4832.10 → 4833.18] And then I need
[4833.18 → 4834.54] four counsellors.
[4836.56 → 4838.14] Four GEMS counsellors.
[4841.88 → 4842.20] Counsellors,
[4842.26 → 4842.74] if you come up
[4842.74 → 4843.12] to the front,
[4843.20 → 4843.96] you don't have to come
[4843.96 → 4844.56] on stage.
[4844.70 → 4845.38] Amara does.
[4847.38 → 4847.66] Two.
[4847.80 → 4848.64] Hey, there we go.
[4850.46 → 4851.00] Very good.
[4851.04 → 4851.60] Let's thank them
[4851.60 → 4852.14] for coming up
[4852.14 → 4852.56] to the front.
[4853.88 → 4854.24] Awesome.
[4854.78 → 4855.14] All right.
[4856.10 → 4856.94] I need two of you
[4856.94 → 4857.38] on this side
[4857.38 → 4857.84] and two of you
[4857.84 → 4858.44] on this side.
[4859.10 → 4859.72] Amara, you need to stand
[4859.72 → 4860.34] right on the edge.
[4861.04 → 4861.52] Turn around.
[4861.52 → 4864.16] Put your hands
[4864.16 → 4864.52] in the air.
[4866.40 → 4867.08] Look at me.
[4868.16 → 4868.94] Fall backwards.
[4870.68 → 4871.98] You should see her face.
[4872.30 → 4873.18] Her face literally
[4873.18 → 4874.52] just like went ghost white.
[4876.44 → 4876.80] No?
[4877.00 → 4877.20] Okay.
[4877.42 → 4878.10] Courtney, tell her
[4878.10 → 4878.38] you're there.
[4881.42 → 4882.96] No, we don't want
[4882.96 → 4883.42] to do that.
[4884.18 → 4884.78] You want to try?
[4885.00 → 4885.74] They're behind you.
[4885.88 → 4886.34] You can hear them.
[4886.52 → 4886.80] Hear them.
[4887.42 → 4887.60] Oh.
[4889.40 → 4889.92] Hear them.
[4891.12 → 4891.46] Hey.
[4891.52 → 4893.94] Good job.
[4894.56 → 4895.38] Thank you.
[4899.54 → 4900.06] Okay.
[4900.26 → 4901.80] Really simple illustration.
[4902.68 → 4902.88] Right?
[4903.46 → 4904.78] She couldn't see
[4904.78 → 4906.96] the people behind her.
[4906.96 → 4910.46] She couldn't be sure,
[4910.84 → 4911.88] at least with her own eyes,
[4912.02 → 4912.70] that they were there.
[4913.92 → 4915.08] But she could hear them.
[4916.20 → 4917.72] She could hear their word
[4917.72 → 4918.60] to her
[4918.60 → 4919.32] that says,
[4919.46 → 4919.80] we're here.
[4920.60 → 4921.84] And she could trust that.
[4923.44 → 4924.10] And so,
[4924.32 → 4924.90] like Esther,
[4925.00 → 4926.26] who couldn't see God,
[4927.26 → 4927.54] right,
[4927.66 → 4929.28] she could hear his word,
[4929.78 → 4930.76] the story that she had been
[4930.76 → 4931.68] raised on and told
[4931.68 → 4932.54] over and over
[4932.54 → 4933.36] and over again,
[4933.36 → 4934.70] and she could fall
[4934.70 → 4935.70] back into him,
[4936.80 → 4937.28] trusting
[4937.28 → 4939.34] that he is there
[4939.34 → 4940.72] to catch her.
[4941.52 → 4942.78] But not only that,
[4943.02 → 4943.28] girls,
[4943.44 → 4944.52] your theme for the year
[4944.52 → 4946.26] is to find his rise up,
[4947.12 → 4947.36] right,
[4947.44 → 4949.66] that God will lift you up,
[4949.74 → 4950.60] he will be the one
[4950.60 → 4951.54] to cause you to soar.
[4951.78 → 4952.84] As you fall back
[4952.84 → 4953.46] into him
[4953.46 → 4955.30] and they catch you,
[4956.00 → 4957.24] they can lift you up.
[4957.24 → 4959.44] But that's what God
[4959.44 → 4961.00] does with his word
[4961.00 → 4961.94] and with his people
[4961.94 → 4963.04] in our lives
[4963.04 → 4964.34] as we trust in him.
[4964.62 → 4965.66] He reveals himself
[4965.66 → 4966.32] to us
[4966.32 → 4967.70] through them.
[4968.42 → 4968.66] And so,
[4968.74 → 4969.56] Gems Counsellors,
[4969.86 → 4971.26] you are a revelation
[4971.26 → 4971.86] of God
[4971.86 → 4972.40] to these girls.
[4973.84 → 4974.54] That's what you do.
[4975.00 → 4976.78] You are teaching them
[4976.78 → 4977.96] the voice of God
[4977.96 → 4979.18] and the presence of God
[4979.18 → 4981.00] so that they can trust him.
[4982.24 → 4982.76] Girls,
[4983.58 → 4984.76] that's what these other women
[4984.76 → 4986.08] are to you,
[4986.78 → 4987.04] right,
[4987.04 → 4988.02] the voice of God
[4988.02 → 4988.68] to each other
[4988.68 → 4989.66] and you
[4989.66 → 4990.84] to your friends,
[4991.62 → 4991.88] right,
[4991.92 → 4992.70] and to your family,
[4992.84 → 4993.74] the voice of God
[4993.74 → 4994.76] to trust him
[4994.76 → 4995.48] and to know
[4995.48 → 4996.18] that he is there.
[4996.78 → 4997.20] And really,
[4997.28 → 4998.30] that's a microcosm
[4998.30 → 4999.14] of all of us,
[4999.80 → 4999.92] right,
[4999.96 → 5001.34] this is all of us
[5001.34 → 5002.40] who are here
[5002.40 → 5004.96] to be the revelation
[5004.96 → 5005.68] of God
[5005.68 → 5006.40] to each other.
[5006.60 → 5008.18] As we hold up his word,
[5008.72 → 5010.02] as we speak that
[5010.02 → 5010.76] to each other,
[5010.96 → 5012.20] we reveal God
[5012.20 → 5012.90] as king
[5012.90 → 5014.62] and as trustworthy.
[5016.12 → 5016.58] We can follow
[5016.58 → 5017.48] and fall back
[5017.48 → 5019.08] into the arms
[5019.08 → 5019.70] of God
[5019.70 → 5020.40] so that he
[5020.40 → 5022.94] can raise us up.
[5024.98 → 5025.84] Mordecai said
[5025.84 → 5027.10] to Esther,
[5027.26 → 5028.36] relief and deliverance
[5028.36 → 5029.02] for the Jews
[5029.02 → 5030.08] may arise
[5030.08 → 5031.06] from another place,
[5032.14 → 5033.04] but maybe
[5033.04 → 5034.38] for such a time
[5034.38 → 5035.00] as this,
[5035.48 → 5036.40] you are the one
[5036.40 → 5037.02] through whom
[5037.02 → 5038.06] it will rise.
[5038.46 → 5039.72] And that's the third truth
[5039.72 → 5040.30] then,
[5040.40 → 5041.44] that coming out
[5041.44 → 5042.34] of God as king
[5042.34 → 5043.40] and him being trustworthy
[5043.40 → 5044.78] is that God
[5044.78 → 5047.02] is our deliverer.
[5048.82 → 5048.96] Right,
[5049.04 → 5049.66] Mordecai knew
[5049.66 → 5051.68] enough of his own story,
[5051.86 → 5052.66] he knew enough
[5052.66 → 5053.24] of the stories
[5053.24 → 5053.70] of faith
[5053.70 → 5054.92] from his upbringing
[5054.92 → 5055.96] to trust
[5055.96 → 5056.72] and to believe
[5056.72 → 5057.40] that God
[5057.40 → 5058.62] is his deliverer.
[5058.92 → 5059.58] And that's again
[5059.58 → 5060.42] why we do
[5060.42 → 5061.18] what we do here
[5061.18 → 5061.82] every week.
[5062.28 → 5063.46] To hear this story
[5063.46 → 5064.34] over and over
[5064.34 → 5065.18] and over again
[5065.18 → 5066.04] so it takes root
[5066.04 → 5067.50] deep within us.
[5068.04 → 5068.92] And then we model it
[5068.92 → 5069.68] and we practice it
[5069.68 → 5070.18] in gems
[5070.18 → 5071.32] and in other places
[5071.32 → 5072.20] and in care groups
[5072.20 → 5073.40] and coming together
[5073.40 → 5074.94] and in our own crises
[5074.94 → 5076.10] and moments of trial
[5076.10 → 5076.72] and pain
[5076.72 → 5078.20] we hear this promise
[5078.20 → 5079.12] that God
[5079.12 → 5081.24] is our deliverer.
[5085.32 → 5086.44] Now the fact
[5086.44 → 5088.26] that this is true
[5088.26 → 5089.66] is seen
[5089.66 → 5093.40] if mysteriously
[5093.40 → 5094.82] and behind the scenes
[5094.82 → 5096.00] in the story of Esther.
[5097.14 → 5097.82] But it's seen
[5097.82 → 5099.12] most evidently
[5099.12 → 5100.14] and most clearly
[5100.14 → 5101.48] in another person
[5101.48 → 5102.32] in history.
[5103.28 → 5104.12] And like Esther
[5104.12 → 5104.98] this person
[5104.98 → 5106.24] intervened
[5106.24 → 5108.04] in humanity's struggles
[5108.04 → 5109.70] under constant threat
[5109.70 → 5110.22] of death.
[5111.04 → 5111.94] And like Esther
[5111.94 → 5112.60] this person
[5112.60 → 5113.82] accepted the reality
[5113.82 → 5116.80] and possibility
[5116.80 → 5117.64] of death
[5117.64 → 5119.44] and still went forward
[5119.44 → 5121.28] as God's means
[5121.28 → 5122.42] of deliverance
[5122.42 → 5123.70] as his agent
[5123.70 → 5124.56] of redemption.
[5125.74 → 5126.86] But unlike Esther
[5126.86 → 5127.64] this man
[5127.64 → 5128.36] whom we know
[5128.36 → 5129.16] as Jesus
[5129.16 → 5130.32] the Messiah
[5130.32 → 5130.94] of Israel
[5130.94 → 5131.50] the Saviour
[5131.50 → 5132.16] of the world
[5132.16 → 5132.98] this man
[5132.98 → 5134.38] did go all the way
[5134.38 → 5135.22] to death
[5135.22 → 5137.12] to bring his deliverance.
[5137.78 → 5138.56] Paul says
[5138.56 → 5140.12] in Romans 5
[5140.12 → 5141.88] he says
[5141.88 → 5142.44] you see
[5142.44 → 5142.46] you see
[5142.46 → 5143.84] at just the right
[5143.84 → 5144.50] time
[5144.50 → 5146.10] when we were
[5146.10 → 5146.92] still powerless
[5146.92 → 5147.92] Christ died
[5147.92 → 5148.96] for the ungodly.
[5149.76 → 5150.40] Very rarely
[5150.40 → 5151.16] will anyone die
[5151.16 → 5152.26] for a righteous man
[5152.26 → 5152.88] though
[5152.88 → 5154.06] for a good man
[5154.06 → 5154.74] someone might
[5154.74 → 5155.96] possibly dare to die
[5155.96 → 5156.82] but God
[5156.82 → 5157.38] demonstrates
[5157.38 → 5158.38] his own love
[5158.38 → 5158.88] for us
[5158.88 → 5159.32] in this
[5159.32 → 5160.26] while we were
[5160.26 → 5160.98] still sinners
[5160.98 → 5162.38] Christ died
[5162.38 → 5163.38] for us.
[5164.94 → 5165.78] Did you catch that?
[5166.16 → 5166.30] Right?
[5166.36 → 5167.46] At just the right
[5167.46 → 5168.16] time.
[5169.22 → 5170.56] At just the right time.
[5170.56 → 5171.76] Things couldn't get
[5171.76 → 5172.34] any worse
[5172.34 → 5173.50] for God's people
[5173.50 → 5174.16] at this time
[5174.16 → 5174.60] in history.
[5174.90 → 5175.54] It's like
[5175.54 → 5176.90] in the time
[5176.90 → 5177.36] of Esther
[5177.36 → 5177.70] again.
[5177.88 → 5178.46] This time
[5178.46 → 5178.88] in history
[5178.88 → 5179.46] is horrible
[5179.46 → 5179.92] for them.
[5180.26 → 5180.32] Right?
[5180.42 → 5181.00] Humanity
[5181.00 → 5181.78] is behaving
[5181.78 → 5182.54] vilely.
[5182.82 → 5183.64] Roman rule
[5183.64 → 5184.52] has overtaken
[5184.52 → 5185.38] godly rule.
[5185.74 → 5186.90] Roman sympathizers
[5186.90 → 5187.46] are sitting
[5187.46 → 5188.26] on the throne
[5188.26 → 5189.16] as Jewish
[5189.16 → 5189.96] puppet kings.
[5190.56 → 5192.04] And in all honesty
[5192.04 → 5192.48] right?
[5192.58 → 5192.70] Like
[5192.70 → 5194.72] things are horrible
[5194.72 → 5196.10] in the world
[5196.10 → 5196.96] and yet
[5196.96 → 5198.82] at just
[5198.82 → 5199.72] the right
[5199.72 → 5200.76] time.
[5202.22 → 5202.86] Perhaps
[5202.86 → 5203.48] for such
[5203.48 → 5204.14] a time
[5204.14 → 5205.30] as this.
[5206.32 → 5206.76] Nothing
[5206.76 → 5207.48] seems to be
[5207.48 → 5208.04] adding up
[5208.04 → 5208.68] nothing seems
[5208.68 → 5209.56] to be making sense
[5209.56 → 5210.54] at just
[5210.54 → 5211.24] the right
[5211.24 → 5212.10] time.
[5212.90 → 5213.58] God seems
[5213.58 → 5214.14] to have forgotten
[5214.14 → 5214.78] his people
[5214.78 → 5215.56] he seems
[5215.56 → 5216.02] distant
[5216.02 → 5217.76] or uninvolved
[5217.76 → 5218.80] but he's not
[5218.80 → 5219.50] because it's
[5219.50 → 5219.86] just
[5219.86 → 5220.64] the right
[5220.64 → 5221.44] time.
[5222.40 → 5222.50] Right?
[5222.58 → 5223.18] God came
[5223.18 → 5223.74] in Jesus
[5223.74 → 5224.34] to live
[5224.34 → 5224.80] the life
[5224.80 → 5225.06] that we
[5225.06 → 5225.46] were called
[5225.46 → 5225.94] to live
[5225.94 → 5226.62] at just
[5226.62 → 5227.04] the right
[5227.04 → 5227.60] time
[5227.60 → 5227.84] and he
[5227.84 → 5228.14] came
[5228.14 → 5228.58] in Jesus
[5228.58 → 5229.04] to die
[5229.04 → 5229.48] the death
[5229.48 → 5229.84] that we
[5229.84 → 5230.48] deserve
[5230.48 → 5231.06] at just
[5231.06 → 5231.64] the right
[5231.64 → 5232.36] time.
[5234.36 → 5235.10] And who
[5235.10 → 5235.56] knows
[5235.56 → 5237.00] but that
[5237.00 → 5237.80] you have
[5237.80 → 5238.22] come
[5238.22 → 5239.08] to royal
[5239.08 → 5239.58] position
[5239.58 → 5240.76] for such
[5240.76 → 5241.42] a time
[5241.42 → 5242.60] as this.
[5243.44 → 5243.54] Right?
[5243.58 → 5244.32] Esther teaches
[5244.32 → 5245.10] us that God
[5245.10 → 5246.24] is our king
[5246.24 → 5246.90] that God
[5246.90 → 5247.50] is trustworthy
[5247.50 → 5248.36] and that God
[5248.36 → 5249.16] is our
[5249.16 → 5249.78] deliverer
[5249.78 → 5250.50] and Esther
[5250.50 → 5251.06] ultimately
[5251.06 → 5251.74] brings us
[5251.74 → 5252.32] to Jesus
[5252.32 → 5252.78] where we
[5252.78 → 5253.44] see that
[5253.44 → 5253.86] truth
[5253.86 → 5254.84] most clearly
[5254.84 → 5255.38] and in
[5255.38 → 5255.72] Jesus
[5255.72 → 5256.84] we see
[5256.84 → 5257.54] also
[5257.54 → 5258.80] that God
[5258.80 → 5260.30] is near.
[5261.26 → 5261.36] Right?
[5261.38 → 5261.70] That God
[5261.70 → 5262.26] is always
[5262.26 → 5262.68] present
[5262.68 → 5262.94] that he
[5262.94 → 5263.42] is always
[5263.42 → 5264.12] working
[5264.12 → 5264.86] guiding
[5264.86 → 5265.44] history
[5265.44 → 5266.34] to his
[5266.34 → 5266.72] ends.
[5267.04 → 5267.36] Esther
[5267.36 → 5267.78] in her
[5267.78 → 5268.08] story
[5268.08 → 5268.38] says
[5268.38 → 5268.76] if I
[5268.76 → 5269.10] die
[5269.10 → 5269.94] I die
[5269.94 → 5270.76] and yet
[5270.76 → 5271.54] did not
[5271.54 → 5271.80] die.
[5271.94 → 5272.30] She is
[5272.30 → 5272.68] teaching
[5272.68 → 5273.16] us
[5273.16 → 5274.44] that God's
[5274.44 → 5275.44] work in
[5275.44 → 5275.92] the world
[5275.92 → 5276.82] is active
[5276.82 → 5278.10] his providence
[5278.10 → 5278.70] is the word
[5278.70 → 5279.38] that we use
[5279.38 → 5281.40] is to
[5281.40 → 5283.40] bring about
[5283.40 → 5284.12] not only
[5284.12 → 5285.02] cosmically
[5285.02 → 5285.98] and globally
[5285.98 → 5286.84] his purposes
[5286.84 → 5287.54] and ends
[5287.54 → 5287.94] but in the
[5287.94 → 5288.62] term providence
[5288.62 → 5289.48] we were talking
[5289.48 → 5290.24] about like
[5290.24 → 5291.44] locally
[5291.44 → 5292.28] and in
[5292.28 → 5293.18] your life
[5293.18 → 5293.92] in your
[5293.92 → 5294.50] heart.
[5295.68 → 5295.76] Right?
[5295.84 → 5296.68] God's providence
[5296.68 → 5297.72] is his sovereignty
[5297.72 → 5298.80] coming near
[5298.80 → 5299.68] to you.
[5300.42 → 5300.90] Right?
[5300.92 → 5301.36] When we say
[5301.36 → 5302.18] God is near
[5302.18 → 5303.06] what we mean
[5303.06 → 5303.60] by that is
[5303.60 → 5304.38] like not a hair
[5304.38 → 5304.84] can fall
[5304.84 → 5305.46] from my head
[5305.46 → 5306.12] without the will
[5306.12 → 5306.68] of my father
[5306.68 → 5307.10] in heaven.
[5308.24 → 5308.36] Right?
[5308.44 → 5309.14] God's nearness
[5309.14 → 5310.10] is shown to us
[5310.10 → 5310.98] in the incarnation
[5310.98 → 5311.84] when God
[5311.84 → 5312.64] took on flesh
[5312.64 → 5313.54] and made his
[5313.54 → 5314.90] dwelling among us.
[5315.00 → 5315.08] Right?
[5315.12 → 5315.64] He became
[5315.64 → 5317.00] as a man.
[5317.68 → 5317.78] Right?
[5318.14 → 5319.10] Eugene Peterson
[5319.10 → 5319.76] says that
[5319.76 → 5320.80] his dwelling
[5320.80 → 5321.26] among us
[5321.26 → 5321.78] he translates
[5321.78 → 5322.66] that by saying
[5322.66 → 5323.54] God moved
[5323.54 → 5324.06] into the
[5324.06 → 5324.38] neighbourhood.
[5325.60 → 5326.52] God is
[5326.52 → 5327.12] near.
[5328.56 → 5329.04] Sometimes
[5329.04 → 5331.16] we can't
[5331.16 → 5331.62] see him.
[5333.72 → 5334.28] Sometimes
[5334.28 → 5335.78] we need
[5335.78 → 5336.06] him
[5336.06 → 5336.80] to reveal
[5336.80 → 5337.52] his nearness
[5337.52 → 5338.34] to us
[5338.34 → 5339.26] by the people
[5339.26 → 5339.92] who lift us
[5339.92 → 5340.18] up
[5340.18 → 5341.22] when we fall
[5341.22 → 5341.92] back in despair.
[5343.14 → 5343.86] That's how
[5343.86 → 5345.14] God is
[5345.14 → 5345.92] near.
[5347.06 → 5347.78] And through
[5347.78 → 5348.34] it all
[5348.34 → 5349.82] through it all
[5349.82 → 5350.44] God
[5350.44 → 5351.48] is
[5351.48 → 5352.76] with you.
[5353.84 → 5354.58] God is
[5354.58 → 5355.38] with you.
[5355.50 → 5356.14] Those who hope
[5356.14 → 5356.70] in the Lord
[5356.70 → 5357.20] will renew
[5357.20 → 5357.82] their strength.
[5357.96 → 5358.22] They will
[5358.22 → 5359.52] soar on wings
[5359.52 → 5360.10] like eagles.
[5360.22 → 5360.78] They will run
[5360.78 → 5361.78] and not grow weary.
[5362.12 → 5362.86] They will walk
[5362.86 → 5364.30] and not be faint.
[5365.04 → 5365.74] God is
[5365.74 → 5366.86] with you.
[5368.48 → 5368.86] And girls
[5368.86 → 5369.32] I'm actually

[5371.04 → 5371.52] people running
[5371.52 → 5371.96] the camera
[5371.96 → 5372.62] they're going
[5372.62 → 5372.86] to hate
[5372.86 → 5373.32] this part
[5373.32 → 5373.56] but

[5393.02 → 5393.22] want to
[5393.22 → 5393.72] say singular

[5849.42 → 5854.72] Once again, as we go, go first with two invitations.
[5854.72 → 5860.86] The first, stick around following our worship time together as we gather for fellowship.
[5861.06 → 5862.78] There should be some refreshments and the like.
[5863.58 → 5869.24] Maybe talk to some of the gems and ask how they have seen God at work in this past year
[5869.24 → 5875.52] or share with them how you have seen God at work in your own life and ask what they've been up to.
[5875.52 → 5881.30] As well, go with an invitation to stick around following that for lunch
[5881.30 → 5887.76] and a time of hearing how God worked through our Mexico mission team together.
[5888.32 → 5893.98] That will be a good time, and we'll move into that following our time of fellowship together.
[5894.86 → 5898.58] Lastly, go with God's blessing.
