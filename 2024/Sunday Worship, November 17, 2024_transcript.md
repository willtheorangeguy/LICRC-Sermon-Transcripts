[0.00 --> 29.98]  Thank you.
[30.00 --> 59.98]  Thank you.
[60.00 --> 89.98]  Thank you.
[90.00 --> 119.98]  Thank you.
[120.00 --> 122.00]  Thank you.
[122.00 --> 130.00]  Thank you.
[130.00 --> 132.00]  Thank you.
[132.00 --> 136.00]  Good morning.
[136.00 --> 138.00]  Good morning.
[138.00 --> 140.62]  Welcome into church this morning.
[140.74 --> 143.18]  A special welcome if you are a guest with us.
[143.68 --> 144.36]  My name is Chris.
[144.54 --> 146.08]  I'm one of the pastors here.
[146.50 --> 155.52]  And it's my privilege, along with these others you see, and a couple more that you don't yet see, to lead in our shared worship together this morning.
[156.24 --> 165.12]  Before we begin, we have a couple announcements to make, and so I'm going to invite Leanne to come to the front, and Pastor Kevin is going to come to the front to make an announcement.
[165.30 --> 169.02]  And as they are on their way up, I will start with the first one.
[169.02 --> 178.48]  Tonight, we have HCBC, so Heidelberg Catechism, Belgic Confession, for the youth and for adults.
[178.94 --> 190.20]  And so at 7 o'clock tonight, youth, you've got your meetings with Kevin and Josh, and then adults, you're invited to have a meeting with me as we read the catechism together.
[190.20 --> 195.54]  So, Pastor Kevin wanted me to tell you, for the youth in particular, bring your own Bible.
[196.80 --> 200.28]  And if you don't have a Bible, tell Pastor Kevin, and he'll get you one.
[201.20 --> 201.76]  All right?
[201.88 --> 202.62]  Bring your own Bible.
[203.00 --> 203.18]  Okay.
[203.40 --> 203.92]  You guys, go.
[204.62 --> 206.96]  This is for the Christmas Ladies event.
[207.38 --> 211.98]  This is the final week to sign up, so by next Sunday, we hope to have our final numbers in for women who are coming.
[212.50 --> 217.64]  Currently, we're sitting at over 100 women and invited guests, so that's awesome, but we have room for lots more.
[217.64 --> 226.12]  We also have several tables that don't have our creative souls there to decorate them, so if you'd like to decorate a table, we also have sign-up space for that.
[226.72 --> 234.56]  And ladies, you're also invited to encourage your husbands to come pick you up after the event, so they can help us reset the church as well.
[234.68 --> 235.76]  That would be great.
[235.90 --> 243.12]  If you have questions, you can sign up on the bulletin, or you can see one of the members of the group at the back after the service.
[245.56 --> 246.42]  Good morning, everyone.
[247.64 --> 261.26]  About three or four months ago, I was approached by Marcel Direct from Gateway Community Church in Abbotsford, letting me know that they do a missions trip every February to the Philippines.
[262.06 --> 264.42]  And he wanted to know if we would be able to join him in that.
[264.42 --> 276.52]  And then, through the popularity of that trip, they've added a second trip in June for specifically the young adults or older of the church, because the young adults in the congregation, a lot of them are off to university and stuff.
[276.58 --> 279.16]  They aren't able to go in February, so he started a second trip in June.
[279.16 --> 285.40]  Now, this trip is a two-week trip, June 1 to 15, that they've invited our church to go to.
[285.50 --> 290.16]  And Josh is going on this trip with two other young adults from our church.
[290.58 --> 293.30]  And there is room for one more person to go.
[293.30 --> 304.48]  Anybody can come and talk to us about that, but especially if you're a young adult or a female young adult, because McKelty's going and she wants a friend, you can come and talk to Josh and I.
[304.54 --> 307.20]  Now, this trip, I want to give a little bit of details, too.
[307.20 --> 312.48]  So, this trip, there is a CRC pastor in the Philippines who was pastoring a church just outside of Manila.
[313.00 --> 318.94]  And during the pandemic, over 75% of his congregation passed away because of COVID.
[319.86 --> 335.42]  When that happened, he was very troubled, of course, and he felt God calling him to continue to pastor this church, but also bring the gospel to communities in the Philippines that have never been reached or never been taught the gospel.
[335.42 --> 349.62]  And so, he started doing that, and he has been going to all sorts of different islands in the Philippines to these nomadic tribes who, on the last trip, they gave this woman a mirror, and she was in her 70s, and she had never seen herself before.
[350.14 --> 357.88]  So, these are the types of people that this pastor is bringing the gospel to, and this is the type of people that this missions trip is joining.
[357.88 --> 363.04]  He's joining this pastor who's going to these islands for two weeks to bring the gospel.
[363.04 --> 370.86]  And so, it's a very unique, very cool opportunity, and we are joining alongside Love Without Borders, I believe is what it's called.
[370.94 --> 375.10]  Love Without Borders is the ministry, and we're joining alongside to bring the gospel to these people.
[375.18 --> 385.94]  So, if you are anybody who's interested in going to the Philippines June 1 to 5, or June 1 to 15 in 2025, especially if you're a young adult, and maybe even more so if you're a female,
[385.94 --> 390.44]  but we'll, honestly, anybody can apply. Come talk to myself, come talk to Josh.
[390.84 --> 394.66]  We would love to have that position filled in the next month.
[394.76 --> 406.02]  So, I know time's ticking, but that is an opportunity that is very unique, and I'm looking forward to seeing what God does with this little team from our church joining Gateway's missions team in June.
[406.44 --> 407.12]  All right, thank you.
[407.12 --> 412.36]  Awesome. We'll look forward to hearing more about that as well.
[413.42 --> 415.56]  A couple more quick announcements.
[416.76 --> 428.28]  On Tuesday night, November 19, there's another Safe Church Training event, and so some of you have probably been contacted about your need to participate in that,
[428.28 --> 434.94]  but that is for everyone who works with children or vulnerable sector populations.
[434.94 --> 442.24]  They're required by our Safe Church policy to have this training once every three years, and we keep a record of that.
[442.38 --> 448.20]  And so, if that is you, or if you don't know if that is you, you can talk to my beautiful bride, Rachel.
[448.40 --> 453.78]  She will answer the question, but you can join on Tuesday night for that event.
[453.78 --> 459.32]  And elders, pastoral and admin elders, we are also meeting on Tuesday night.
[459.42 --> 460.74]  Just a reminder that that is there.
[460.84 --> 462.68]  We will meet at 6, starting with dinner.
[463.52 --> 473.60]  And then last announcement, on Thursday at 6 p.m., we're going to have our next Christianity Explored class, which is Introduction to Christian Faith.
[474.18 --> 477.44]  And so, if you've been participating in that, that's this week, Thursday.
[477.62 --> 483.06]  We'll have dinner there as well, and encourage you to come along, invite your friends, join up.
[483.06 --> 486.62]  If you haven't yet attended, but would be interested in coming, talk to me.
[486.88 --> 488.32]  We'd love to incorporate you in that.
[490.20 --> 491.86]  I think that's it for my announcements.
[491.96 --> 499.46]  Let's stand together as we're gathered up into the presence of our God in shared worship this morning.
[499.96 --> 505.24]  Following my giving the greeting to you, I'm going to invite you to turn to those around you
[505.24 --> 509.96]  and to greet them in the name of the Lord, welcome them into his presence together.
[509.96 --> 518.24]  Just a reminder, as we're entering into our in-cough, cold, and flu season, not everyone wants to shake hands or hugs.
[519.14 --> 521.84]  And so, make eye contact first, ask for permission.
[522.36 --> 525.62]  Anyway, interact well with each other is what I'm asking for here.
[526.06 --> 528.38]  Let's receive the greeting of our good God.
[528.38 --> 537.12]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you, from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, Son, and our Savior,
[537.54 --> 539.76]  through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[540.66 --> 541.00]  Amen.
[558.38 --> 578.04]  Good morning.
[580.32 --> 583.74]  As we enter into a time of worship this morning,
[583.74 --> 588.36]  we turn our eyes upon Jesus and worship him who loves us,
[588.76 --> 594.36]  who knows our every need, our every care, and our every trial and sorrow,
[594.80 --> 597.60]  and is always with us through it all.
[598.48 --> 604.18]  With this in mind, our call to worship this morning is found in Psalm 18, verses 1 and 2.
[604.18 --> 607.90]  I love you, Lord, my strength.
[608.54 --> 612.70]  The Lord is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer.
[613.54 --> 616.64]  My God is my rock in whom I take refuge,
[617.12 --> 621.52]  my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.
[622.34 --> 623.68]  Let's worship him together.
[623.68 --> 647.00]  Come all you weary, come all you thirsty,
[647.46 --> 651.54]  come to the world that never runs dry.
[651.54 --> 658.18]  Drink of the water, come and thirst no more.
[660.40 --> 664.90]  Come all you sinners, come find his mercy,
[665.40 --> 669.04]  come to the table, he will satisfy.
[669.76 --> 675.32]  Taste of his goodness, find what you're looking for.
[675.32 --> 683.18]  For God so loved the world that he gave us,
[683.18 --> 687.72]  His one and only Son to save us,
[687.72 --> 692.96]  Who never believes in him will live forever.
[696.18 --> 700.94]  Bring all your failures, bring your addictions,
[700.94 --> 705.44]  Don't lay them down at the foot of the cross.
[705.44 --> 708.80]  Jesus is waiting there,
[708.80 --> 711.80]  You're going on.
[713.80 --> 719.16]  For God so loved the world that he gave us,
[719.24 --> 723.64]  His one and only Son to save us,
[723.70 --> 728.80]  Who never believes in him will live forever.
[728.80 --> 736.66]  The power of hell, forever you need,
[736.66 --> 741.06]  Now it is well, the walking in freedom,
[741.38 --> 746.80]  For God so loved, God so loved the world.
[746.80 --> 761.08]  Praise God, praise God, praise God,
[761.08 --> 762.80]  Praise God, praise God, praise God,
[762.80 --> 767.12]  For the wonders of his love.
[767.60 --> 770.80]  Praise God, praise God,
[770.80 --> 792.68]  Praise God, praise God, praise him.
[792.68 --> 806.60]  is
[822.68 --> 827.80]  God so loved, God so loved the world.
[830.80 --> 835.60]  Bring all your failures, bring your addictions,
[835.60 --> 840.18]  come lay them down at the foot of the cross.
[840.38 --> 847.02]  Jesus is waiting, God so loved the world.
[852.68 --> 854.68]  Amen.
[882.68 --> 884.68]  Amen.
[912.68 --> 914.68]  Amen.
[942.68 --> 944.68]  Amen.
[972.68 --> 974.68]  Amen.
[974.68 --> 978.68]  Amen.
[984.68 --> 988.68]  Amen.
[988.68 --> 998.16]  Oh Lord Jesus, oh
[998.16 --> 1006.30]  Oh Lord Jesus, oh
[1018.68 --> 1022.00]  Please bow with me in prayer.
[1026.44 --> 1035.30]  Merciful God, you tell us and we believe that you forgive and pardon all who truly repent and turn to you.
[1037.10 --> 1047.04]  As we take a few moments now in a time of silent and personal confession, we humbly confess that we have sinned and we ask for your mercy and forgiveness.
[1048.68 --> 1078.66]  Thank you.
[1078.68 --> 1082.02]  Dear God,
[1082.02 --> 1088.56]  In your loving kindness and your great compassion, cleanse us from our sin.
[1089.66 --> 1092.10]  Create in us a clean heart, oh Lord.
[1092.80 --> 1094.70]  Renew a right spirit within us.
[1095.58 --> 1099.28]  Do not cast us from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from us.
[1100.16 --> 1106.52]  Lord, restore to us the joy of our salvation and sustain us with your bountiful spirit.
[1106.82 --> 1109.96]  In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[1109.96 --> 1126.30]  Create in me a clean heart, oh God.
[1126.30 --> 1132.64]  And renew a right spirit within me.
[1132.64 --> 1143.30]  Create in me a clean heart, oh God.
[1143.30 --> 1150.30]  And renew a right spirit within me.
[1150.30 --> 1159.68]  Cast me not away from thy presence, oh Lord.
[1159.68 --> 1161.68]  And take my Holy Spirit from me.
[1161.68 --> 1166.68]  And take my Holy Spirit from me.
[1166.68 --> 1175.68]  Restore unto me the joy of our salvation.
[1175.68 --> 1182.68]  And renew a right spirit within me.
[1182.68 --> 1183.68]  And renew a right spirit within me.
[1183.68 --> 1192.68]  Create in me a clean heart, oh God.
[1192.68 --> 1199.68]  And renew a right spirit within me.
[1199.68 --> 1208.68]  Create in me a clean heart, oh God.
[1208.68 --> 1214.68]  And renew a right spirit within me.
[1214.68 --> 1218.68]  Cast me not away from your life.
[1218.68 --> 1223.68]  Cast me not away from thy presence, oh Lord.
[1223.68 --> 1227.68]  And take my Holy Spirit from me.
[1227.68 --> 1235.68]  And restore unto me the joy of our salvation.
[1235.68 --> 1241.68]  The joy of knowing salvation
[1241.68 --> 1248.68]  And reveal a right spirit within me
[1248.68 --> 1256.68]  Pass me not away from thy presence, O Lord
[1256.68 --> 1263.68]  And take not thy Holy Spirit from me
[1263.68 --> 1272.48]  Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation
[1272.48 --> 1279.76]  And renew a right spirit within me
[1279.76 --> 1287.64]  Please rise for the next couple songs.
[1293.68 --> 1295.68]  Amen.
[1323.68 --> 1329.68]  That saved a wretch like me
[1329.68 --> 1336.68]  I once was lost, but now am found
[1336.68 --> 1342.68]  Was mine, but now I see
[1342.68 --> 1349.68]  It's grace that taught my heart to hear
[1349.68 --> 1355.68]  And grace my fears relieved
[1355.68 --> 1362.68]  How precious did that grace appear
[1362.68 --> 1367.68]  The hour I first believed
[1367.68 --> 1374.68]  My chains are gone, I've been set free
[1374.68 --> 1380.68]  My God, my Savior, has ransomed me
[1380.68 --> 1386.68]  And why the blood is mercy made
[1386.68 --> 1393.68]  On an ending love, amazing grace
[1393.68 --> 1403.68]  The Lord has promised good to me
[1403.68 --> 1409.68]  His word my hope secures
[1409.68 --> 1416.68]  He will my shield and portion be
[1416.68 --> 1422.68]  As long as life endures
[1422.68 --> 1429.68]  Through many dangers, toils and snares
[1429.68 --> 1435.68]  I have already come
[1435.68 --> 1439.68]  His grace that taught me
[1439.68 --> 1441.68]  He saved us far
[1441.68 --> 1447.68]  And grace will lead me home
[1447.68 --> 1453.68]  My chains are gone, I've been set free
[1453.68 --> 1459.68]  My God, my Savior, has ransomed me
[1459.68 --> 1465.68]  And why the blood is mercy made
[1465.68 --> 1472.68]  On an ending love, amazing grace
[1472.68 --> 1482.68]  When we've been there ten thousand years
[1482.68 --> 1484.68]  Bright shining as the sun
[1484.68 --> 1488.68]  Bright shining as the sun
[1488.68 --> 1495.68]  We've no less days to sing God's praise
[1495.68 --> 1500.68]  Than when we first begun
[1500.68 --> 1506.68]  My chains are gone, I've been set free
[1506.68 --> 1512.68]  My God, my Savior, has ransomed me
[1512.68 --> 1517.68]  And why the blood is mercy made
[1517.68 --> 1518.68]  My God, my Savior, has ransomed me
[1518.68 --> 1519.68]  And why the blood is mercy made
[1519.68 --> 1523.68]  My God, my Savior, has ransomed me
[1523.68 --> 1526.68]  Amazing grace
[1526.68 --> 1532.68]  My chains are gone, I've been set free
[1532.68 --> 1538.68]  My God, my Savior, has ransomed me
[1538.68 --> 1544.68]  And why the blood is mercy made
[1544.68 --> 1548.68]  Amazing grace
[1548.68 --> 1553.68]  Amazing grace
[1578.68 --> 1580.68]  I believe in Jesus
[1580.68 --> 1582.68]  I believe in Jesus
[1582.68 --> 1589.68]  I believe He is the Son of God
[1589.68 --> 1595.68]  I believe He died and rose again
[1595.68 --> 1601.68]  I believe He paid for us all
[1601.68 --> 1607.68]  I believe He is here now
[1607.68 --> 1610.68]  Standing in our midst
[1610.68 --> 1613.68]  Standing in our midst
[1613.68 --> 1617.68]  With the power to heal now
[1617.68 --> 1622.68]  And the grace to forgive
[1622.68 --> 1627.68]  I believe in you, Lord
[1627.68 --> 1630.68]  I believe in you, Lord
[1630.68 --> 1636.68]  I believe you are the Son of God
[1636.68 --> 1641.68]  I believe you died and rose again
[1641.68 --> 1646.68]  I believe you paid for us all
[1646.68 --> 1651.68]  I believe you are here now
[1651.68 --> 1656.68]  Standing in our midst
[1656.68 --> 1659.68]  And made in our midst
[1659.68 --> 1660.68]  And made in our midst
[1660.68 --> 1666.68]  Here with the power to heal now
[1666.68 --> 1669.68]  And the grace to forgive
[1669.68 --> 1670.68]  I believe in you, Lord
[1670.68 --> 1672.68]  I believe you are the Son of God
[1672.68 --> 1676.68]  I believe you died and rose again
[1676.68 --> 1681.68]  I believe you paid for us all
[1681.68 --> 1688.68]  I believe you died and rose again
[1688.68 --> 1691.68]  I believe you paid for us all
[1691.68 --> 1692.68]  I believe you died and rose again
[1692.68 --> 1694.68]  I believe you paid for us all
[1694.68 --> 1696.68]  I believe you are here now
[1696.68 --> 1698.68]  I believe you are here now
[1698.68 --> 1699.68]  I believe you are here now
[1699.68 --> 1701.68]  I believe you are here now
[1701.68 --> 1703.68]  Standing in our midst
[1703.68 --> 1707.68]  Standing in our midst
[1707.68 --> 1709.68]  Here with the power to heal now
[1709.68 --> 1712.68]  The power to heal now
[1712.68 --> 1713.68]  The power to heal now
[1713.68 --> 1718.68]  We have the grace to forgive
[1718.68 --> 1733.68]  Your heart to heal now
[1733.68 --> 1737.68]  The power to heal now
[1737.68 --> 1738.68]  The power to heal now
[1738.68 --> 1741.68]  Good morning
[1741.68 --> 1742.68]  My name is Brenda
[1742.68 --> 1744.68]  I'm one of the deacons here at Emanuel
[1744.68 --> 1751.36]  It's a time for our offerings today, and our first offering is for the budget and ministries
[1751.36 --> 1755.92]  of this church, and I have just a little note to highlight here.
[1755.92 --> 1763.14]  You can see in the bulletin the deficit that we have at the end of this year.
[1763.14 --> 1767.06]  We are about 20% behind in our budget-to-date giving.
[1767.06 --> 1770.34]  That works out to about $100,000.
[1770.34 --> 1774.90]  We know this trend is normal by this time of year, but we are slightly higher in our
[1774.90 --> 1777.56]  deficit than previous years.
[1777.56 --> 1783.60]  We ask you to prayerfully consider how you might give in support of the ministry and mission
[1783.60 --> 1786.06]  of Langley Emanuel.
[1786.06 --> 1790.86]  God has blessed many people through our work together, and we pray that he would continue
[1790.86 --> 1795.02]  to do that through your generous support.
[1795.02 --> 1798.08]  So that's for our budget and ministries.
[1798.08 --> 1807.04]  Our special offering today is for World Renew, and specifically the Canadian Food Grains Bank.
[1807.04 --> 1812.80]  Canadian Food Grains Bank, it's a partnership of 15 Canadian churches and church-based agencies
[1812.80 --> 1817.90]  working together to end world hunger.
[1817.90 --> 1826.86]  They officially began in 1983, but their roots are back to the 1970s.
[1826.86 --> 1833.50]  It is rooted in the belief that all are created in the image of God, and that it is God's desire
[1833.50 --> 1837.14]  that no person should go hungry.
[1837.14 --> 1843.86]  World Renew is one of the founding members of the Canadian Food Grains Bank.
[1843.86 --> 1849.14]  They work with locally-based organizations in developing countries to meet emergency food
[1849.14 --> 1856.24]  needs, to foster long-term solutions, and to work with government agencies to support this
[1856.24 --> 1857.60]  cause.
[1857.60 --> 1861.70]  And donations that are received are matched four to one.
[1861.70 --> 1863.70]  Let's give as the Lord has blessed us.
[1863.70 --> 1864.70]  Let's give as the Lord has blessed us.
[1864.70 --> 1868.70]  Let's give as the Lord has blessed us.
[1868.70 --> 1894.62]  Father's mistakes is
[1894.62 --> 1894.82]  Eunice the father's love over you.
[1894.82 --> 1900.28]  How deep the Father's love for us.
[1900.28 --> 1905.28]  How vast beyond all measure.
[1906.56 --> 1911.94]  That he would give his only Son.
[1912.60 --> 1917.34]  To make a wretch his treasure.
[1918.98 --> 1924.60]  How great the pain of stealing was.
[1924.82 --> 1930.34]  The Father turns his face away.
[1931.16 --> 1936.54]  As wounds which bore the Chosen One.
[1937.10 --> 1941.56]  Bring many sons to glory.
[1941.56 --> 1958.52]  Behold the man upon a cross.
[1958.90 --> 1963.64]  I sit upon his shoulders.
[1963.64 --> 1969.64]  Ashamed I hear my knocking noise.
[1971.16 --> 1975.64]  All loud among the scoffers.
[1975.64 --> 1981.64]  It was like sin that held it there.
[1983.16 --> 1987.64]  Until it was accomplished.
[1989.24 --> 1993.64]  His dying breath has brought me life.
[1993.64 --> 1999.78]  I know that it is fitting.
[1999.78 --> 2015.72]  I will not boast in anything.
[2015.72 --> 2021.48]  No gifts, no powers, no wisdom.
[2022.06 --> 2028.58]  But I will boast in Jesus Christ.
[2029.06 --> 2033.38]  His death and resurrection.
[2033.38 --> 2039.38]  Why should I gain from his reward?
[2039.38 --> 2045.38]  I cannot give an answer.
[2045.38 --> 2052.38]  But this I know with all my heart.
[2052.38 --> 2057.76]  His wounds have paid my ransom.
[2057.76 --> 2087.74]  His wounds have paid my ransom.
[2087.74 --> 2091.88]  His wounds have paid my ransom.
[2091.88 --> 2092.80]  His wounds have paid my ransom.
[2092.86 --> 2095.64]  His wounds have paid my ransom.
[2095.70 --> 2097.52]  My wounds have paid my ransom.
[2097.52 --> 2101.20]  I would love to invite all of the kids forward to join me up here.
[2101.20 --> 2103.80]  and you can come take a seat.
[2108.98 --> 2110.84]  You have to come up quietly, though.
[2110.90 --> 2112.28]  Hank is very tired.
[2113.56 --> 2114.42]  Oh, don't touch him.
[2114.52 --> 2115.04]  Don't touch him.
[2115.96 --> 2117.38]  He's very sleepy.
[2119.88 --> 2121.64]  We're going to need to wake him up, I think.
[2121.82 --> 2122.54]  What do you think?
[2122.98 --> 2123.74]  Should we do that?
[2124.36 --> 2127.30]  Can you say, hi, Hank, on the count of three,
[2127.30 --> 2128.20]  and maybe he'll wake up.
[2128.42 --> 2128.74]  Are you ready?
[2129.02 --> 2130.72]  One, two, three.
[2131.20 --> 2132.20]  Hi, Hank.
[2135.70 --> 2136.22]  Wow.
[2137.98 --> 2139.08]  He's so tired.
[2139.34 --> 2140.40]  I think you've got to say it again.
[2140.48 --> 2140.84]  Are you ready?
[2141.30 --> 2142.78]  One, two, three.
[2143.24 --> 2144.24]  Hi, Hank.
[2145.10 --> 2146.38]  Oh, wow.
[2147.28 --> 2148.48]  Morning, everyone.
[2149.26 --> 2150.98]  It's good to see you.
[2151.16 --> 2152.34]  Hank, you're so tired.
[2152.42 --> 2153.34]  Why are you so tired?
[2153.94 --> 2156.46]  I've been very busy lately.
[2156.46 --> 2158.12]  What have you been doing?
[2158.94 --> 2160.28]  I volunteer.
[2161.20 --> 2162.20]  You volunteer?
[2162.62 --> 2163.90]  Who do you volunteer for?
[2164.50 --> 2166.32]  A company called Sniffs.
[2167.36 --> 2167.88]  Sniffs?
[2168.34 --> 2169.48]  Yeah, Sniffs.
[2170.48 --> 2171.62]  What does Sniffs do?
[2172.12 --> 2176.72]  It helps people find those socks that are missing from the laundry.
[2176.72 --> 2180.62]  You know how kids lose their socks in the laundry?
[2181.12 --> 2185.22]  They hire me because I'm a dog, and then I go find the lost sock.
[2186.00 --> 2188.98]  Do you want to know what Sniffs stands for?
[2189.74 --> 2191.10]  Yep, I do.
[2191.48 --> 2193.28]  What does Sniffs stand for?
[2194.32 --> 2194.92]  Sniffing.
[2195.72 --> 2196.36]  Investigating.
[2197.66 --> 2198.26]  Sniffing.
[2199.26 --> 2199.90]  Investigating.
[2199.90 --> 2202.02]  Forgotten footwear.
[2202.52 --> 2202.84]  Son.
[2203.42 --> 2205.02]  Oh, that's good.
[2205.10 --> 2206.00]  What's with the sun?
[2206.26 --> 2209.14]  It had to be Sniffs, because there's more than one of us.
[2209.38 --> 2209.80]  All right.
[2209.88 --> 2210.62]  Sounds good.
[2211.12 --> 2212.90]  That's fun that you get to help out in that way.
[2213.16 --> 2216.90]  Yeah, people are really happy when I find their missing socks.
[2217.28 --> 2218.64]  I'm sure they are.
[2218.86 --> 2222.98]  We're actually going to talk about what it means to help people, too, today in children's worship time.
[2223.30 --> 2224.30]  That's so good!
[2224.90 --> 2227.78]  We're going to learn a little bit from a story in Exodus about that.
[2227.84 --> 2228.52]  Does that sound fun?
[2229.28 --> 2229.56]  Yeah?
[2229.82 --> 2235.62]  We're going to pray first, and then we're going to go to children's worship time, and then we'll do the Lord's blessing, actually, and then we'll go to children's worship time, okay?
[2235.88 --> 2237.62]  So let's bow our heads, close our eyes, let's pray.
[2238.52 --> 2240.16]  Father God, we thank you so much for this day.
[2240.28 --> 2241.90]  Thank you that we could be here in church today.
[2241.90 --> 2251.06]  We pray that as we learn more about you, both here in the sanctuary and in the children's worship time rooms, we pray that you will be close to us and teach us what it is you want to teach us.
[2251.06 --> 2252.36]  We pray this in your name.
[2252.92 --> 2253.22]  Amen.
[2254.06 --> 2254.88]  All right, let's stand up.
[2255.22 --> 2256.88]  We're going to do the Lord's blessing together.
[2257.32 --> 2258.34]  Do you remember what we're going to say?
[2259.16 --> 2260.40]  The Lord be with you.
[2260.42 --> 2261.18]  We're going to say that together.
[2261.26 --> 2261.70]  Are you ready?
[2261.86 --> 2262.54]  On the count of three.
[2262.60 --> 2263.36]  One, two, three.
[2281.06 --> 2288.84]  Good morning.
[2289.08 --> 2290.18]  My name is Seth.
[2290.26 --> 2294.84]  I'm an elder here at our church, and it's my pleasure to lead you in our congregational prayer.
[2295.46 --> 2298.88]  Before I do that, though, we have an announcement from the council.
[2299.26 --> 2304.06]  Our congregational meeting has been moved, the date conflicted with LCS Society meeting,
[2304.06 --> 2308.06]  and so we're moving our annual general meeting to December 1st.
[2308.76 --> 2319.70]  That will start, well, the meeting doesn't start until 6 o'clock, but if you can be here at 5 o'clock, fun times could ensue if there's a chance that you could overturn John Fulkert's championship.
[2320.78 --> 2329.06]  We've got the Tri-Soup Challenge, and John is really hoping to win this thing again, but it's always fun if there's some competition there, so looking forward to that.
[2329.06 --> 2331.26]  So join us at 5 on December 1st.
[2331.52 --> 2333.22]  The meeting will start at 6.
[2334.96 --> 2341.28]  Everybody should have received, if you're over 18 and a member, you should have received a copy of the agenda and the budget as well in your mailboxes.
[2342.88 --> 2344.08]  Please join me in prayer.
[2347.44 --> 2352.04]  Heavenly Father, we come before you today with hearts full of gratitude and reverence.
[2352.04 --> 2362.14]  You are the creator of the heavens and the earth, the one who holds all things in your hands, and the God who calls us, your children, into a living relationship with you.
[2363.26 --> 2366.68]  We thank you for the grace you have poured out upon us in Christ Jesus.
[2367.54 --> 2371.86]  It is through him that we have been made new, forgiven, and reconciled to you.
[2372.56 --> 2378.12]  It is because of your sovereignty that we can walk through the struggles of this life, trusting you and your goodness.
[2378.12 --> 2386.28]  As we gather in your name today, we acknowledge that we are a people who are not perfect, but are being transformed by your grace.
[2386.88 --> 2391.32]  We confessed our sins to you, knowing that you are faithful and just to forgive us.
[2392.10 --> 2396.52]  Forgive us, Lord, for the times we have failed to love you with all our heart, soul, and mind,
[2396.92 --> 2399.96]  and for the times we have failed to love our neighbors as ourselves.
[2401.20 --> 2405.46]  Cleanse us from unrighteousness and empower us to live more fully as your disciples.
[2405.46 --> 2412.66]  Father, we pray for the staff, the full council, and for all ministry leaders and volunteers of this church.
[2413.78 --> 2417.04]  Grant them wisdom, discernment, and strength as they serve your body.
[2417.84 --> 2423.32]  Help them to be faithful stewards of the gospel, leading with humility, integrity, and grace.
[2424.74 --> 2430.32]  May they be people who seek your will above all else, who serve the flock with love,
[2430.72 --> 2433.48]  and who encourage the body to grow in faith and good works.
[2433.48 --> 2437.02]  And we thank you for evidence of this growth in our church,
[2437.36 --> 2440.70]  as there are many new people coming to faith or returning to faith,
[2440.86 --> 2443.00]  and that are connecting with our church family right now.
[2443.64 --> 2448.30]  We pray for your spirit to continue to be at work in those people's lives, drawing them closer to you.
[2450.00 --> 2451.76]  We also lift up our families, Lord.
[2452.22 --> 2453.62]  We pray for strong marriages,
[2454.26 --> 2458.52]  for parents who are faithful in raising their children in the nurture and fear of the Lord,
[2458.52 --> 2461.62]  and for children who grow up to know and love you.
[2462.80 --> 2467.00]  Strengthen our homes, and may they be places of peace, love, and encouragement.
[2467.96 --> 2471.26]  We ask that you protect our families from division and strife,
[2471.46 --> 2474.88]  and help us to be a reflection of your love to the world around us.
[2476.54 --> 2479.04]  Lord, we bring to you the needs of our community.
[2479.04 --> 2482.30]  You know the hearts of every person in this congregation,
[2482.88 --> 2487.04]  and we pray for those who are struggling physically, emotionally, or spiritually.
[2488.04 --> 2491.48]  For the sick, the hurting, the grieving, and the lonely,
[2492.22 --> 2494.64]  may your presence be their comfort and healing.
[2495.34 --> 2498.70]  And we ask for that comfort in particular for the family of Ernst de Vries,
[2498.94 --> 2500.34]  as they mourn his sudden passing.
[2500.34 --> 2504.68]  We also pray for Ashley as she continues her chemo treatment,
[2505.20 --> 2507.36]  asking that you will give strength and complete healing.
[2508.56 --> 2511.80]  We pray too for Linda Rook, of Neil and Linda Rooks,
[2511.90 --> 2514.66]  as she was recently diagnosed with breast cancer.
[2515.64 --> 2518.72]  We thank you that she was able to have surgery and is recovering at home,
[2518.94 --> 2521.84]  but we ask that you will continue to bless them
[2521.84 --> 2523.54]  as they determine the next course of treatment.
[2524.36 --> 2526.12]  We pray for your peace for Linda and Neil,
[2526.32 --> 2527.92]  and for full healing of Linda's body.
[2527.92 --> 2530.94]  We bring to you as well,
[2531.16 --> 2532.28]  Clary Klosterhof's father,
[2532.50 --> 2533.82]  who has some upcoming testing.
[2534.72 --> 2537.18]  And we pray that he will get good results,
[2537.46 --> 2540.76]  and also that he'll have clarity in decisions to be made moving forward.
[2542.40 --> 2545.76]  We pray too in thankfulness for the healing that you've given Mary already,
[2546.12 --> 2547.66]  and ask for continued improvement.
[2549.32 --> 2552.60]  For the shut-ins and others who cannot physically join us on Sundays,
[2553.34 --> 2555.64]  bless them with a tangible awareness of your presence,
[2555.64 --> 2558.26]  and help us to reach out to them as a community.
[2559.58 --> 2564.00]  For those battling addiction, anxiety, depression, or other burdens,
[2564.50 --> 2566.42]  we ask for your strength and peace.
[2568.78 --> 2572.14]  Lord, we pray that your word may continue to be our guide and light.
[2572.14 --> 2575.76]  As a congregation that holds to the truths of scripture,
[2576.30 --> 2578.48]  may we always remain faithful to your word.
[2578.48 --> 2582.66]  Help us to commit time and effort to grow in understanding
[2582.66 --> 2584.26]  by reading your word,
[2584.72 --> 2585.74]  to love your commandments,
[2586.18 --> 2587.56]  and to live according to your will.
[2588.86 --> 2591.32]  May the preaching of the word shared today by Chris
[2591.32 --> 2594.70]  bring conviction, hope, and transformation in our lives.
[2595.36 --> 2596.82]  Let it be a lamp to our feet
[2596.82 --> 2598.24]  and a light to our path,
[2598.68 --> 2600.42]  leading us to trust in your sovereignty.
[2600.42 --> 2604.70]  We ask all of this in the precious name of Jesus Christ,
[2605.08 --> 2608.00]  our Savior, our King, and our Lord.
[2608.86 --> 2609.24]  Amen.
[2609.24 --> 2609.32]  Amen.
[2609.32 --> 2632.58]  This morning, we continue in our look at the story of Joseph
[2632.58 --> 2637.38]  as we look for helps and encouragement
[2637.38 --> 2641.34]  and sustaining presence out of God's sovereignty
[2641.34 --> 2643.54]  in the midst of our own suffering.
[2644.68 --> 2646.18]  I'm going to read this morning
[2646.18 --> 2650.06]  the second part of the chapter that we started last week.
[2650.54 --> 2652.72]  So from Genesis 41,
[2653.52 --> 2655.10]  I'm going to start at verse 41
[2655.10 --> 2656.58]  and read through to the end.
[2657.00 --> 2658.28]  There, I'm going to start with that
[2658.28 --> 2659.56]  and then we'll dive in.
[2659.92 --> 2660.72]  Let's read together.
[2662.58 --> 2664.26]  So Pharaoh said to Joseph,
[2664.76 --> 2668.12]  I hereby put you in charge of the whole land of Egypt.
[2668.88 --> 2672.18]  Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his finger
[2672.18 --> 2674.04]  and put it on Joseph's finger.
[2674.52 --> 2676.44]  He dressed him in robes of fine linen
[2676.44 --> 2678.54]  and put a gold chain around his neck.
[2679.12 --> 2682.10]  He had him ride in a chariot as his second in command
[2682.10 --> 2683.90]  and people shouted before him,
[2684.00 --> 2684.50]  Make way.
[2685.44 --> 2688.16]  Thus he put him in charge of the whole land of Egypt.
[2689.52 --> 2691.12]  And Pharaoh said to Joseph,
[2691.12 --> 2693.00]  I am Pharaoh,
[2693.00 --> 2694.40]  But without your word,
[2694.54 --> 2696.94]  no one will lift hand or foot in all Egypt.
[2697.84 --> 2702.30]  Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zephathnath, Paneah,
[2702.60 --> 2706.28]  and gave him Asenath, daughter of Potipharah,
[2706.62 --> 2708.18]  priest of On, to be his wife.
[2708.58 --> 2710.50]  And Joseph went through the land of Egypt.
[2711.80 --> 2714.98]  Joseph was 30 years old
[2714.98 --> 2717.56]  when he entered the service of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.
[2717.56 --> 2720.52]  And Joseph went out from Pharaoh's presence
[2720.52 --> 2722.02]  and traveled throughout Egypt.
[2722.80 --> 2724.90]  During the seven years of abundance,
[2725.26 --> 2726.84]  the land produced plentifully.
[2728.14 --> 2729.92]  Joseph collected all the food produced
[2729.92 --> 2732.00]  in those seven years of abundance in Egypt
[2732.00 --> 2733.48]  and stored it in the cities.
[2734.46 --> 2737.00]  In each city, he put the food grown in the fields
[2737.00 --> 2737.74]  surrounding it.
[2738.94 --> 2741.50]  Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain
[2741.50 --> 2743.14]  like the sand of the sea.
[2743.14 --> 2747.12]  And so it was so much that he stopped keeping records
[2747.12 --> 2748.82]  because it was beyond measure.
[2750.46 --> 2752.48]  Before the years of famine came,
[2752.62 --> 2754.26]  two sons were born to Joseph
[2754.26 --> 2757.06]  by Asenath, daughter of Potipharah,
[2757.38 --> 2758.00]  priest of On.
[2758.38 --> 2760.90]  Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh
[2760.90 --> 2761.70]  and said,
[2761.70 --> 2763.98]  It is because God has made me forget
[2763.98 --> 2764.78]  all my troubles
[2764.78 --> 2766.24]  and all my father's household.
[2767.06 --> 2769.38]  The second son, he named Ephraim
[2769.38 --> 2769.88]  and said,
[2770.18 --> 2772.14]  It is because God has made me fruitful
[2772.14 --> 2773.56]  in the land of my suffering.
[2775.12 --> 2777.28]  The seven years of abundance in Egypt
[2777.28 --> 2778.36]  came to an end
[2778.36 --> 2780.86]  and the seven years of famine began
[2780.86 --> 2782.84]  just as Joseph had said.
[2783.52 --> 2785.46]  There was famine in all the other lands
[2785.46 --> 2786.84]  but in the whole land of Egypt
[2786.84 --> 2787.60]  there was food.
[2788.86 --> 2791.30]  When all Egypt began to feel the famine,
[2791.30 --> 2793.40]  the people cried to Pharaoh for food
[2793.40 --> 2795.92]  and then Pharaoh told all the Egyptians,
[2796.48 --> 2798.76]  Go to Joseph and do what he tells you.
[2799.86 --> 2801.30]  When the famine had spread
[2801.30 --> 2802.40]  over the whole country,
[2802.58 --> 2804.32]  Joseph opened all the storehouses
[2804.32 --> 2806.50]  and sold grain to the Egyptians
[2806.50 --> 2809.28]  for the famine was severe throughout the land
[2809.28 --> 2811.74]  and all the world came to Egypt
[2811.74 --> 2813.46]  to buy grain from Joseph
[2813.46 --> 2816.50]  because the famine was severe everywhere.
[2817.62 --> 2819.04]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2821.30 --> 2825.86]  Now this morning,
[2826.22 --> 2828.24]  I want to do something
[2828.24 --> 2831.94]  a little bit different with our time,
[2832.00 --> 2833.18]  a little bit out of the ordinary,
[2833.46 --> 2835.04]  at least out of the ordinary
[2835.04 --> 2837.72]  from my perspective in leading.
[2839.12 --> 2840.54]  What I want to do this morning
[2840.54 --> 2843.40]  is spend this time
[2843.40 --> 2846.56]  telling you a few stories.
[2846.56 --> 2850.68]  Now, I'm going to say this at the front.
[2850.80 --> 2851.64]  At some point,
[2851.96 --> 2853.10]  some of you are going to wonder,
[2853.26 --> 2854.98]  what on earth does this have to do with Joseph?
[2856.04 --> 2857.40]  I want to ask for your patience.
[2858.46 --> 2859.56]  Please stick with me
[2859.56 --> 2860.78]  and we'll get there.
[2861.76 --> 2862.82]  Some of these stories
[2862.82 --> 2863.94]  are ones that I've read
[2863.94 --> 2865.06]  and find really compelling.
[2866.28 --> 2868.58]  Most of them are stories from my own life
[2868.58 --> 2871.90]  and there's one that is from friends of mine
[2871.90 --> 2873.52]  that I've used with their permission.
[2873.52 --> 2876.74]  Now, the first story
[2876.74 --> 2878.04]  that I want to share with you
[2878.04 --> 2880.24]  is about a woman named Debbie
[2880.24 --> 2881.64]  and it's a story
[2881.64 --> 2883.66]  that's told by Melissa Kruger.
[2885.12 --> 2886.62]  Melissa and Debbie are friends.
[2887.58 --> 2889.42]  Melissa writes the following.
[2889.58 --> 2889.94]  She says,
[2889.94 --> 2892.54]  I knock on the door expectantly
[2892.54 --> 2894.60]  and my friend Debbie
[2894.60 --> 2896.20]  greets me in sweatpants
[2896.20 --> 2897.64]  that hang loosely
[2897.64 --> 2899.74]  on her diminishing frame.
[2901.18 --> 2903.68]  Her face is slightly paler
[2903.68 --> 2905.32]  than the last time I saw her
[2905.32 --> 2907.40]  and soft peach fuzz
[2907.40 --> 2908.96]  graces the top of her head.
[2910.02 --> 2913.16]  She is the most beautiful woman I know.
[2914.90 --> 2916.84]  I hug her tightly,
[2917.34 --> 2918.48]  not wanting to let go,
[2918.48 --> 2920.56]  wanting somehow to freeze
[2920.56 --> 2921.82]  this moment in time.
[2922.40 --> 2924.88]  The cancer that began in her breast
[2924.88 --> 2926.36]  continues to spread
[2926.36 --> 2927.52]  through the rest of her body.
[2928.76 --> 2930.14]  She has more tumors
[2930.14 --> 2931.60]  than the doctors can count,
[2932.04 --> 2933.84]  rapidly overtaking her brain.
[2935.30 --> 2937.68]  Daily, she faces agonizing stomach pains
[2937.68 --> 2938.34]  and discomfort
[2938.34 --> 2940.64]  and in the midst of the physical pain,
[2941.02 --> 2942.30]  the emotional heartache
[2942.30 --> 2944.24]  of saying goodbye to her husband
[2944.24 --> 2945.58]  and to her children
[2945.58 --> 2947.90]  is an ever-present companion.
[2950.02 --> 2951.70]  Deep waves of suffering
[2951.70 --> 2953.22]  have come to my friend
[2953.22 --> 2956.02]  whose faith is still so fresh
[2956.02 --> 2956.82]  and so new.
[2957.66 --> 2958.96]  Her journey with cancer
[2958.96 --> 2960.00]  four years ago
[2960.00 --> 2961.16]  was the beginning
[2961.16 --> 2962.96]  of her journey to faith.
[2964.24 --> 2965.34]  Debbie describes
[2965.34 --> 2968.50]  God's work in her own life.
[2969.68 --> 2970.38]  Debbie says,
[2970.38 --> 2971.72]  I was struggling
[2971.72 --> 2973.32]  with my faith in Christ
[2973.32 --> 2974.32]  for several years
[2974.32 --> 2975.50]  before my diagnosis.
[2976.46 --> 2978.26]  I prayed to have the faith
[2978.26 --> 2979.42]  of a little child again.
[2979.56 --> 2980.68]  I read and I researched
[2980.68 --> 2983.26]  and I tried to make myself believe.
[2983.60 --> 2984.58]  The problem is
[2984.58 --> 2986.80]  you can't make yourself believe in Christ.
[2987.46 --> 2988.84]  It's purely a gift.
[2990.42 --> 2991.86]  God gave me that gift
[2991.86 --> 2993.58]  with my first cancer diagnosis
[2993.58 --> 2995.68]  in December of 2008.
[2995.68 --> 2999.90]  And following chemotherapy treatments
[2999.90 --> 3000.70]  and radiation,
[3001.24 --> 3003.88]  that gift continued in 2009.
[3004.46 --> 3006.78]  And then in July of 2010,
[3007.00 --> 3007.68]  during my battle
[3007.68 --> 3009.14]  with my first brain tumor
[3009.14 --> 3011.68]  and first set of partial brain
[3011.68 --> 3012.82]  radiation treatments,
[3013.28 --> 3014.26]  God spoke to me
[3014.26 --> 3015.70]  and told me that I was his
[3015.70 --> 3016.70]  and he filled me
[3016.70 --> 3017.96]  with his Holy Spirit.
[3018.80 --> 3019.76]  I learned more
[3019.76 --> 3021.36]  about finding true joy
[3021.36 --> 3022.20]  and contentment
[3022.20 --> 3023.34]  in all circumstances
[3023.34 --> 3025.68]  and I gained new spiritual gifts
[3025.68 --> 3026.96]  as he continued to work
[3026.96 --> 3028.26]  to transform me.
[3029.48 --> 3031.24]  In November of 2011,
[3031.48 --> 3032.44]  with the diagnosis
[3032.44 --> 3033.86]  of a second brain tumor,
[3034.20 --> 3035.54]  followed by two more
[3035.54 --> 3036.32]  brain surgeries
[3036.32 --> 3037.30]  and a second round
[3037.30 --> 3039.42]  of partial brain radiation treatments,
[3039.50 --> 3040.38]  along with surgery
[3040.38 --> 3041.90]  to remove a tumor in my lung,
[3042.20 --> 3042.90]  he taught me
[3042.90 --> 3044.54]  yet more dependence on him.
[3046.32 --> 3047.38]  But still,
[3047.62 --> 3049.20]  this wouldn't be enough
[3049.20 --> 3050.32]  to bring me
[3050.32 --> 3051.28]  to where my soul
[3051.28 --> 3052.02]  needed to be.
[3053.34 --> 3054.96]  This past April,
[3055.20 --> 3055.74]  she writes,
[3055.98 --> 3057.14]  I got the diagnosis
[3057.14 --> 3058.94]  of four more brain tumors,
[3059.68 --> 3060.94]  now on the left side
[3060.94 --> 3061.52]  of my brain,
[3062.58 --> 3063.60]  followed by 12
[3063.60 --> 3065.60]  whole brain radiation treatments.
[3067.28 --> 3069.50]  It took this last battle
[3069.50 --> 3071.84]  to completely humble me,
[3072.48 --> 3074.40]  to make me understand
[3074.40 --> 3076.10]  my complete dependence on God.
[3076.82 --> 3078.52]  I finally feel like
[3078.52 --> 3079.24]  I'm on the road
[3079.24 --> 3080.76]  to the daily conversational
[3080.76 --> 3081.36]  relationship
[3081.36 --> 3082.78]  with my heavenly father
[3082.78 --> 3083.42]  that I've always
[3083.42 --> 3084.38]  strongly desired
[3084.38 --> 3085.02]  and envied
[3085.02 --> 3085.78]  in the few people
[3085.78 --> 3086.60]  I've seen
[3086.60 --> 3087.52]  who truly have it.
[3091.52 --> 3092.68]  It's been worth
[3092.68 --> 3094.06]  every day
[3094.06 --> 3095.76]  I have suffered.
[3095.76 --> 3109.16]  God has been weaving
[3109.16 --> 3110.32]  a story in my life.
[3112.00 --> 3112.76]  When I thought
[3112.76 --> 3113.48]  he was refusing
[3113.48 --> 3114.62]  to answer my prayers
[3114.62 --> 3115.44]  and refusing
[3115.44 --> 3116.62]  to show himself to me,
[3116.82 --> 3117.68]  he was standing
[3117.68 --> 3118.64]  just at the edges
[3118.64 --> 3119.50]  but never gone.
[3120.46 --> 3121.76]  He knew the full picture.
[3123.20 --> 3124.52]  He cares about my soul.
[3124.52 --> 3131.30]  Melissa goes on
[3131.30 --> 3132.08]  in telling a story
[3132.08 --> 3134.08]  that Debbie first came
[3134.08 --> 3134.98]  to see her
[3134.98 --> 3137.32]  when she was a seeker
[3137.32 --> 3138.08]  journeying
[3138.08 --> 3139.08]  and they met
[3139.08 --> 3139.90]  at an outreach
[3139.90 --> 3140.60]  Bible study
[3140.60 --> 3141.52]  four years ago.
[3143.18 --> 3143.52]  Melissa,
[3143.78 --> 3144.82]  reflecting on Debbie,
[3145.04 --> 3146.08]  says that she is
[3146.08 --> 3147.02]  teaching us all
[3147.02 --> 3147.70]  the beauty
[3147.70 --> 3149.82]  of faithful suffering.
[3149.82 --> 3152.10]  In the midst
[3152.10 --> 3153.00]  of losing hair
[3153.00 --> 3153.76]  and eyelashes
[3153.76 --> 3154.50]  and eyebrows,
[3154.94 --> 3155.58]  she glows
[3155.58 --> 3156.92]  with an indescribable
[3156.92 --> 3157.54]  radiance.
[3158.44 --> 3159.90]  The dark depths
[3159.90 --> 3160.90]  of her affliction
[3160.90 --> 3161.90]  make her faith
[3161.90 --> 3162.56]  shine
[3162.56 --> 3164.10]  all the more clearly.
[3165.46 --> 3166.72]  She believes
[3166.72 --> 3167.40]  her suffering
[3167.40 --> 3168.20]  has value
[3168.20 --> 3169.28]  because she treasures
[3169.28 --> 3170.04]  the growth
[3170.04 --> 3170.74]  it brings
[3170.74 --> 3171.32]  to her
[3171.32 --> 3173.20]  spiritual life.
[3173.20 --> 3173.28]  life.
[3174.98 --> 3175.80]  She knows
[3175.80 --> 3176.36]  her soul
[3176.36 --> 3176.98]  will live
[3176.98 --> 3177.62]  even if
[3177.62 --> 3178.08]  her body
[3178.08 --> 3178.64]  fails.
[3182.42 --> 3182.94]  Now,
[3182.98 --> 3183.42]  in their telling
[3183.42 --> 3184.16]  of this story,
[3185.18 --> 3186.06]  Melissa and Debbie
[3186.06 --> 3186.68]  conclude,
[3186.68 --> 3189.14]  does it matter
[3189.14 --> 3190.04]  how we walk
[3190.04 --> 3190.78]  in the face
[3190.78 --> 3191.38]  of suffering?
[3192.66 --> 3193.44]  The Bible
[3193.44 --> 3194.60]  makes unapologetic
[3194.60 --> 3195.28]  claims about
[3195.28 --> 3195.80]  how we should
[3195.80 --> 3196.52]  face suffering.
[3196.90 --> 3197.72]  1 Peter 4,
[3197.84 --> 3199.08]  13 says,
[3199.20 --> 3199.76]  but rejoice
[3199.76 --> 3200.72]  that you participate
[3200.72 --> 3201.66]  in the sufferings
[3201.66 --> 3202.20]  of Christ
[3202.20 --> 3203.10]  so that you may
[3203.10 --> 3204.04]  be overjoyed
[3204.04 --> 3204.82]  when his glory
[3204.82 --> 3205.52]  is revealed.
[3206.92 --> 3207.32]  Together,
[3207.46 --> 3207.94]  they reflect
[3207.94 --> 3208.76]  allowing us
[3208.76 --> 3209.56]  to experience
[3209.56 --> 3210.42]  the brokenness
[3210.42 --> 3211.18]  of this world
[3211.18 --> 3212.64]  keeps us thirsty
[3212.64 --> 3213.60]  for the next.
[3215.46 --> 3216.58]  The reality
[3216.58 --> 3217.16]  of death
[3217.16 --> 3217.82]  forces us
[3217.82 --> 3218.34]  to consider
[3218.34 --> 3218.94]  carefully
[3218.94 --> 3220.12]  how we live.
[3221.98 --> 3223.26]  Only by believing
[3223.26 --> 3223.88]  that a better
[3223.88 --> 3224.74]  home awaits
[3224.74 --> 3226.14]  can we experience
[3226.14 --> 3227.60]  any sort of light
[3227.60 --> 3228.88]  in this land
[3228.88 --> 3229.60]  of shadows.
[3231.42 --> 3232.54]  Debbie would not
[3232.54 --> 3233.74]  choose her situation.
[3236.32 --> 3237.40]  Melissa reflects,
[3237.70 --> 3238.28]  she has,
[3238.48 --> 3238.70]  however,
[3238.96 --> 3240.06]  chosen how
[3240.06 --> 3241.66]  to live in it.
[3242.86 --> 3243.62]  She lives
[3243.62 --> 3244.12]  as a servant
[3244.12 --> 3244.60]  of God.
[3246.58 --> 3248.94]  The next story
[3248.94 --> 3249.50]  I want to share
[3249.50 --> 3251.96]  is from friends
[3251.96 --> 3252.36]  of ours.
[3252.64 --> 3253.04]  Some of you
[3253.04 --> 3253.34]  have heard
[3253.34 --> 3253.94]  parts of their
[3253.94 --> 3254.46]  stories in
[3254.46 --> 3254.94]  different places
[3254.94 --> 3255.40]  before.
[3257.44 --> 3258.28]  Rachel and I
[3258.28 --> 3259.32]  met Josh
[3259.32 --> 3259.82]  in April
[3259.82 --> 3261.54]  while we were
[3261.54 --> 3262.22]  in seminary
[3262.22 --> 3263.50]  and we quickly
[3263.50 --> 3264.64]  became friends
[3264.64 --> 3265.04]  with them.
[3266.40 --> 3267.20]  Rachel and I
[3267.20 --> 3267.82]  were married
[3267.82 --> 3268.70]  for just a few
[3268.70 --> 3269.06]  months.
[3269.26 --> 3269.70]  When we met
[3269.70 --> 3269.90]  them,
[3269.98 --> 3270.40]  they had been
[3270.40 --> 3271.20]  married for seven
[3271.20 --> 3272.28]  years and had
[3272.28 --> 3272.80]  been trying to
[3272.80 --> 3273.56]  have kids together
[3273.56 --> 3274.18]  for the last
[3274.18 --> 3274.52]  three.
[3276.00 --> 3276.62]  They tried
[3276.62 --> 3277.20]  everything.
[3277.80 --> 3278.76]  Fertility drugs,
[3278.98 --> 3279.60]  DNCs,
[3280.14 --> 3281.22]  IVF,
[3281.40 --> 3282.02]  all of it.
[3282.12 --> 3282.52]  Some of you
[3282.52 --> 3283.72]  know exactly
[3283.72 --> 3285.04]  what I'm talking
[3285.04 --> 3285.38]  about.
[3287.92 --> 3288.90]  As part of
[3288.90 --> 3289.82]  that process,
[3290.14 --> 3291.50]  they harvested
[3291.50 --> 3293.02]  and fertilized
[3293.02 --> 3295.18]  five,
[3295.52 --> 3296.60]  or of the eggs
[3296.60 --> 3297.02]  that they had
[3297.02 --> 3297.66]  harvested and
[3297.66 --> 3298.22]  fertilized,
[3298.30 --> 3299.18]  only five
[3299.18 --> 3301.08]  became embryos
[3301.08 --> 3302.94]  and the first
[3302.94 --> 3305.22]  two implantations
[3305.22 --> 3305.96]  had failed.
[3307.32 --> 3308.14]  And on this
[3308.14 --> 3309.14]  particular day,
[3309.28 --> 3310.94]  Josh and April
[3310.94 --> 3311.74]  were going back
[3311.74 --> 3312.80]  to Ontario,
[3313.00 --> 3313.54]  to the hospital
[3313.54 --> 3313.92]  that they had
[3313.92 --> 3314.30]  been working
[3314.30 --> 3314.68]  with,
[3315.04 --> 3315.70]  while we were
[3315.70 --> 3316.22]  in Michigan,
[3317.16 --> 3318.08]  to try for the
[3318.08 --> 3318.64]  third time.
[3319.64 --> 3320.20]  And Josh had
[3320.20 --> 3320.98]  gathered us up
[3320.98 --> 3321.72]  together as
[3321.72 --> 3322.48]  friends and
[3322.48 --> 3323.52]  asked us to
[3323.52 --> 3325.00]  pray for this
[3325.00 --> 3326.08]  journey and for
[3326.08 --> 3326.86]  this process.
[3326.86 --> 3337.86]  Josh came
[3337.86 --> 3338.26]  and found
[3338.26 --> 3339.62]  us later,
[3340.50 --> 3342.10]  and we were
[3342.10 --> 3342.68]  where we normally
[3342.68 --> 3343.18]  were, which was
[3343.18 --> 3343.56]  in the corner
[3343.56 --> 3344.24]  of the library,
[3344.80 --> 3346.60]  and he saw
[3346.60 --> 3348.00]  us and started
[3348.00 --> 3348.66]  weeping.
[3349.78 --> 3350.46]  And the only
[3350.46 --> 3351.08]  thing he said
[3351.08 --> 3351.92]  to me was,
[3352.72 --> 3354.06]  I think God
[3354.06 --> 3355.08]  hates me.
[3356.86 --> 3357.88]  because it
[3357.88 --> 3358.44]  didn't work.
[3359.54 --> 3360.72]  It failed
[3360.72 --> 3361.50]  again.
[3362.54 --> 3363.22]  And so we
[3363.22 --> 3364.26]  all wept
[3364.26 --> 3365.04]  together
[3365.04 --> 3366.20]  in the
[3366.20 --> 3366.58]  library.
[3370.38 --> 3371.20]  Now,
[3372.14 --> 3373.12]  fast forward
[3373.12 --> 3374.36]  a few months,
[3374.94 --> 3375.92]  and Josh and
[3375.92 --> 3376.90]  April, with all
[3376.90 --> 3377.80]  the failures
[3377.80 --> 3378.82]  that they've
[3378.82 --> 3379.20]  experienced,
[3379.30 --> 3380.26]  decided that
[3380.26 --> 3380.50]  they're going
[3380.50 --> 3381.04]  to adopt.
[3381.04 --> 3384.52]  and I
[3384.52 --> 3385.34]  honestly was
[3385.34 --> 3385.68]  trying to
[3385.68 --> 3386.36]  remember Rachel,
[3386.50 --> 3387.14]  but it felt
[3387.14 --> 3387.64]  like it was
[3387.64 --> 3388.14]  this quick.
[3388.40 --> 3389.00]  Three weeks
[3389.00 --> 3389.46]  after they
[3389.46 --> 3390.12]  decided that
[3390.12 --> 3390.36]  they were
[3390.36 --> 3390.80]  going to
[3390.80 --> 3391.18]  adopt,
[3391.50 --> 3391.98]  a family
[3391.98 --> 3392.46]  phoned them
[3392.46 --> 3392.76]  and said,
[3392.84 --> 3393.10]  hey, I
[3393.10 --> 3393.56]  just had a
[3393.56 --> 3393.92]  baby and
[3393.92 --> 3394.26]  I want you
[3394.26 --> 3394.46]  to be
[3394.46 --> 3395.00]  their parents.
[3396.26 --> 3396.70]  And so
[3396.70 --> 3397.04]  they took
[3397.04 --> 3397.38]  home this
[3397.38 --> 3397.98]  beautiful baby
[3397.98 --> 3399.36]  girl named
[3399.36 --> 3399.74]  Kaylin.
[3402.66 --> 3403.38]  Fast forward
[3403.38 --> 3404.04]  to present
[3404.04 --> 3404.38]  day,
[3405.04 --> 3405.44]  Josh and
[3405.44 --> 3406.00]  April have
[3406.00 --> 3407.06]  three beautiful
[3407.06 --> 3407.62]  kids.
[3407.76 --> 3408.10]  Kaylin,
[3408.58 --> 3409.18]  they're adopted.
[3409.44 --> 3410.18]  Jude, who
[3410.18 --> 3411.34]  is an IVF
[3411.34 --> 3411.82]  baby that
[3411.82 --> 3412.44]  did end up
[3412.44 --> 3412.92]  working for
[3412.92 --> 3413.60]  them, and
[3413.60 --> 3414.28]  Lucas, their
[3414.28 --> 3414.98]  youngest, who's
[3414.98 --> 3415.90]  an embryo that
[3415.90 --> 3416.46]  they adopted
[3416.46 --> 3418.24]  and then April
[3418.24 --> 3418.94]  carried to
[3418.94 --> 3419.20]  term.
[3421.38 --> 3422.20]  This summer,
[3422.36 --> 3422.98]  we sat with
[3422.98 --> 3424.56]  them camping
[3424.56 --> 3425.20]  with a group
[3425.20 --> 3425.70]  of friends,
[3425.88 --> 3426.30]  and at one
[3426.30 --> 3428.02]  point, Josh
[3428.02 --> 3429.14]  turns to me
[3429.14 --> 3430.30]  and he says,
[3430.70 --> 3431.86]  look how God
[3431.86 --> 3432.54]  has blessed
[3432.54 --> 3433.04]  us.
[3435.28 --> 3436.12]  That's a long
[3436.12 --> 3437.62]  way from,
[3438.02 --> 3438.56]  I think God
[3438.56 --> 3439.12]  hates me.
[3440.18 --> 3443.74]  these are our
[3443.74 --> 3444.20]  stories.
[3447.60 --> 3448.38]  Summer of
[3448.38 --> 3449.26]  2007,
[3450.60 --> 3452.10]  Rachel and I
[3452.10 --> 3452.76]  had just
[3452.76 --> 3453.80]  written our
[3453.80 --> 3454.68]  final exams
[3454.68 --> 3455.48]  at university.
[3456.02 --> 3456.86]  A week later,
[3456.94 --> 3457.58]  we got married.
[3458.58 --> 3458.82]  Yay.
[3460.72 --> 3461.80]  The next week,
[3461.88 --> 3462.38]  we were in
[3462.38 --> 3463.20]  Cuba for our
[3463.20 --> 3463.56]  honeymoon.
[3464.70 --> 3465.94]  The week after
[3465.94 --> 3466.90]  coming back
[3466.90 --> 3467.34]  from our
[3467.34 --> 3468.24]  honeymoon, we
[3468.24 --> 3469.08]  received our
[3469.08 --> 3469.74]  degrees and
[3469.74 --> 3470.46]  had graduation
[3470.46 --> 3471.40]  ceremonies and
[3471.40 --> 3472.64]  celebrations and
[3472.64 --> 3473.04]  parties.
[3473.20 --> 3473.96]  In two months'
[3474.10 --> 3475.08]  time, we were
[3475.08 --> 3475.98]  going to move to
[3475.98 --> 3476.62]  Grand Rapids,
[3476.74 --> 3477.54]  Michigan, so I
[3477.54 --> 3478.32]  could start my
[3478.32 --> 3479.50]  master's program
[3479.50 --> 3479.96]  together.
[3480.42 --> 3481.92]  And on June 28,
[3482.78 --> 3483.96]  a good friend of
[3483.96 --> 3485.74]  ours was killed
[3485.74 --> 3487.42]  in a car crash
[3487.42 --> 3488.98]  while visiting his
[3488.98 --> 3490.22]  family in
[3490.22 --> 3490.46]  Carmen,
[3490.46 --> 3491.02]  Manitoba.
[3491.02 --> 3494.04]  Our friend group
[3494.04 --> 3495.24]  was devastated.
[3496.76 --> 3497.24]  Twenty,
[3497.44 --> 3498.22]  twenty-five of
[3498.22 --> 3499.22]  us gathered
[3499.22 --> 3500.16]  together in
[3500.16 --> 3500.98]  our house where
[3500.98 --> 3502.18]  I lived with
[3502.18 --> 3503.12]  Craig before
[3503.12 --> 3503.88]  getting married,
[3504.10 --> 3505.16]  and we gathered
[3505.16 --> 3506.26]  there to cry,
[3506.78 --> 3508.02]  and Karis was
[3508.02 --> 3508.66]  there, and her
[3508.66 --> 3509.48]  dad came and
[3509.48 --> 3510.40]  actually joined us
[3510.40 --> 3511.38]  and led us in
[3511.38 --> 3512.68]  prayer in that
[3512.68 --> 3513.00]  moment.
[3513.00 --> 3517.38]  And I didn't
[3517.38 --> 3518.06]  remember this part
[3518.06 --> 3518.94]  of the story until
[3518.94 --> 3520.28]  this week as I
[3520.28 --> 3521.04]  was reflecting on
[3521.04 --> 3521.56]  sharing it with
[3521.56 --> 3521.84]  you.
[3522.92 --> 3524.06]  In that moment,
[3524.30 --> 3525.22]  in my group of
[3525.22 --> 3526.66]  friends, I felt
[3526.66 --> 3527.60]  like I had to be
[3527.60 --> 3528.80]  strong, and I
[3528.80 --> 3529.62]  felt like I had to
[3529.62 --> 3530.62]  help people carry
[3530.62 --> 3531.86]  the weight of this
[3531.86 --> 3533.22]  tragic moment.
[3534.28 --> 3535.04]  And then Rachel
[3535.04 --> 3536.28]  and I, after being
[3536.28 --> 3537.16]  with our friends,
[3537.46 --> 3538.60]  got in our car,
[3538.72 --> 3539.52]  and we drove back
[3539.52 --> 3540.92]  to our basement
[3540.92 --> 3541.80]  apartment that we
[3541.80 --> 3542.50]  were living in for
[3542.50 --> 3543.52]  those few months,
[3543.66 --> 3544.16]  and when we got
[3544.16 --> 3545.42]  home, I opened the
[3545.42 --> 3546.32]  door, and I
[3546.32 --> 3547.06]  stepped out of the
[3547.06 --> 3547.70]  car, and I
[3547.70 --> 3548.88]  collapsed to the
[3548.88 --> 3550.34]  ground, weeping.
[3551.98 --> 3553.10]  Weeping at the
[3553.10 --> 3554.12]  death of my
[3554.12 --> 3554.58]  friend.
[3556.02 --> 3556.84]  Weeping at the
[3556.84 --> 3557.68]  tragedy that we
[3557.68 --> 3558.82]  were all living in
[3558.82 --> 3559.52]  the midst of, and I
[3559.52 --> 3560.68]  just couldn't carry
[3560.68 --> 3561.32]  it anymore.
[3561.44 --> 3562.02]  And praise God,
[3562.08 --> 3563.00]  Rachel gathered
[3563.00 --> 3564.12]  me up, took me
[3564.12 --> 3564.54]  inside.
[3566.60 --> 3567.56]  Now a number of
[3567.56 --> 3568.22]  us in that group
[3568.22 --> 3569.32]  of friends decided
[3569.32 --> 3569.98]  that we were going
[3569.98 --> 3570.64]  to travel to
[3570.64 --> 3571.00]  Carmen,
[3571.00 --> 3572.46]  Manitoba, for the
[3572.46 --> 3572.80]  funeral.
[3573.94 --> 3575.20]  And so like 18 of
[3575.20 --> 3577.26]  us got on a plane,
[3577.66 --> 3579.62]  and we flew to
[3579.62 --> 3580.74]  Winnipeg, and then
[3580.74 --> 3581.60]  got picked up by
[3581.60 --> 3582.86]  Craig's parents and
[3582.86 --> 3584.02]  his family, and
[3584.02 --> 3584.84]  brought to his
[3584.84 --> 3585.72]  house and to his
[3585.72 --> 3586.48]  cousin's property
[3586.48 --> 3588.06]  where we stayed
[3588.06 --> 3588.54]  together.
[3589.54 --> 3590.76]  And in that week
[3590.76 --> 3592.12]  of time together,
[3592.24 --> 3593.30]  those days of time
[3593.30 --> 3594.38]  together, there was
[3594.38 --> 3595.42]  this weird thing
[3595.42 --> 3596.28]  that took place, and
[3596.28 --> 3597.36]  many of you can
[3597.36 --> 3598.06]  understand this,
[3598.14 --> 3598.26]  right?
[3598.26 --> 3598.92]  Like there was
[3598.92 --> 3600.82]  laughter, and there
[3600.82 --> 3601.34]  was tears.
[3602.26 --> 3603.34]  There was mourning
[3603.34 --> 3604.52]  and hurt and pain,
[3604.52 --> 3605.90]  and we had so much
[3605.90 --> 3607.10]  fun together.
[3609.26 --> 3610.68]  In that moment, it's
[3610.68 --> 3611.56]  weird, and it doesn't
[3611.56 --> 3613.40]  make sense, and it
[3613.40 --> 3614.40]  doesn't make it okay,
[3614.52 --> 3615.24]  not at all.
[3616.52 --> 3617.58]  But it does make it
[3617.58 --> 3619.08]  different, right?
[3619.08 --> 3622.36]  Craig's parents and
[3622.36 --> 3623.96]  his family would
[3623.96 --> 3625.82]  remark how important
[3625.82 --> 3627.40]  that was for them to
[3627.40 --> 3628.26]  get a glimpse into
[3628.26 --> 3629.20]  Craig's university
[3629.20 --> 3630.78]  friends and family, and
[3630.78 --> 3632.12]  his life lived so far
[3632.12 --> 3634.26]  away from them, right,
[3634.32 --> 3635.64]  for four years.
[3637.12 --> 3638.46]  And reflecting back on
[3638.46 --> 3639.70]  that journey, like God
[3639.70 --> 3641.06]  used that moment and
[3641.06 --> 3642.24]  that circumstance to
[3642.24 --> 3644.14]  show me that the
[3644.14 --> 3645.48]  church of God is just
[3645.48 --> 3647.32]  so much bigger, and
[3647.32 --> 3648.64]  that we, as brothers
[3648.64 --> 3649.26]  and sisters in
[3649.26 --> 3650.26]  Christ, are so much
[3650.26 --> 3652.10]  closer because of our
[3652.10 --> 3653.90]  shared faith that I
[3653.90 --> 3654.42]  could ever have
[3654.42 --> 3655.34]  previously imagined.
[3656.26 --> 3656.46]  Right?
[3656.46 --> 3657.84]  He used that event to
[3657.84 --> 3659.76]  show me that tears and
[3659.76 --> 3660.98]  laughter, that suffering
[3660.98 --> 3662.54]  and joy are part of the
[3662.54 --> 3666.30]  Christian experience, and
[3666.30 --> 3667.48]  that I can't be spared
[3667.48 --> 3670.16]  the reality of
[3670.16 --> 3674.26]  suffering, but I can
[3674.26 --> 3675.10]  worship in the midst
[3675.10 --> 3675.42]  of it.
[3677.90 --> 3678.88]  And at his funeral,
[3679.10 --> 3680.36]  hundreds of hundreds of
[3680.36 --> 3681.52]  family and friends and
[3681.52 --> 3682.40]  community members
[3682.40 --> 3684.16]  gathered together, and
[3684.16 --> 3685.60]  we sang and we blew the
[3685.60 --> 3687.04]  roof off of that little
[3687.04 --> 3687.80]  church in Carmen,
[3687.90 --> 3688.90]  Manitoba, singing,
[3689.00 --> 3689.48]  Great is thy
[3689.48 --> 3690.08]  faithfulness.
[3694.44 --> 3695.60]  These are our stories.
[3695.60 --> 3708.84]  When I was 18, I got a
[3708.84 --> 3711.32]  call from one of my
[3711.32 --> 3712.04]  best friends.
[3713.40 --> 3715.70]  Now, some of you, this is
[3715.70 --> 3717.50]  going to be weird, but it
[3717.50 --> 3719.06]  used to be the case that you
[3719.06 --> 3720.36]  only had phones that stayed
[3720.36 --> 3722.62]  on the wall, and they were
[3722.62 --> 3725.76]  attached to it by a cord, and
[3725.76 --> 3727.38]  if someone phoned after 10
[3727.38 --> 3729.16]  o'clock, it was only ever
[3729.16 --> 3730.30]  because something was wrong,
[3730.36 --> 3731.36]  not because they just wanted
[3731.36 --> 3732.58]  to chat and they had you in
[3732.58 --> 3733.74]  their pocket the whole time.
[3734.40 --> 3735.34]  And so when the phone rings
[3735.34 --> 3737.94]  after 10 o'clock, there's a
[3737.94 --> 3739.92]  generation of us here who go,
[3740.06 --> 3740.98]  oh crap, who died?
[3741.92 --> 3742.90]  Because that's the only reason
[3742.90 --> 3743.92]  the phone rings after 10.
[3745.38 --> 3747.58]  But we got a phone call after
[3747.58 --> 3750.84]  10 o'clock that one of my
[3750.84 --> 3755.54]  best friends had tried to
[3755.54 --> 3756.50]  take his own life.
[3763.20 --> 3770.00]  And so we rushed over to his
[3770.00 --> 3774.38]  house to be with him and with
[3774.38 --> 3778.28]  his parents, and they had
[3778.28 --> 3781.46]  called a friend of theirs who
[3781.46 --> 3782.60]  was an elder in the church.
[3783.70 --> 3785.66]  Now, at this point in my life,
[3785.90 --> 3787.48]  if you know my own story, I
[3787.48 --> 3788.50]  wasn't very close to God.
[3789.08 --> 3790.16]  I wasn't a good Christian.
[3791.06 --> 3793.32]  My default posture was
[3793.32 --> 3795.96]  definitely not to pray, but
[3795.96 --> 3797.04]  that's what this elder did.
[3798.24 --> 3799.90]  He said, we need to pray
[3799.90 --> 3801.20]  together, boys.
[3802.14 --> 3803.90]  And there we were, a group of
[3803.90 --> 3805.64]  five boys, only two of us who
[3805.64 --> 3806.70]  pretended to be Christians.
[3806.70 --> 3808.88]  Everyone else was at a loss for
[3808.88 --> 3809.32]  what to do.
[3811.30 --> 3813.24]  God used that moment, right, and
[3813.24 --> 3814.88]  reflecting on that back now,
[3815.30 --> 3817.46]  amongst many other things, but
[3817.46 --> 3820.66]  poignantly, to craft in my
[3820.66 --> 3823.90]  vision a default to pray in the
[3823.90 --> 3826.44]  midst of the utter brokenness and
[3826.44 --> 3828.86]  unknown and chaoses of life.
[3828.86 --> 3838.20]  coming up on 15 years ago, I
[3838.20 --> 3841.84]  started in my first church in
[3841.84 --> 3843.34]  ministry.
[3843.50 --> 3846.98]  The first Sunday on the job, I
[3846.98 --> 3848.64]  stood in front of the church, and I
[3848.64 --> 3850.30]  had to confess that I almost burned
[3850.30 --> 3851.74]  the entire church building down
[3851.74 --> 3854.08]  because I had left an oven mitt in
[3854.08 --> 3856.12]  what I thought was the storage tray
[3856.12 --> 3856.88]  under the oven.
[3856.88 --> 3858.72]  Turns out it was a warming tray
[3858.72 --> 3862.26]  caught on fire, and there was a
[3862.26 --> 3864.24]  massive smoke plume in the
[3864.24 --> 3866.50]  kitchen, and I had to confess to
[3866.50 --> 3867.72]  them, I almost burned down your
[3867.72 --> 3868.80]  church, and I've only been here for
[3868.80 --> 3869.34]  three days.
[3869.74 --> 3870.10]  Sorry.
[3870.76 --> 3872.76]  Hopefully that's not a parable of
[3872.76 --> 3873.42]  what is to come.
[3874.42 --> 3876.30]  In truth, I still have that oven mitt
[3876.30 --> 3878.46]  in my office right now as a
[3878.46 --> 3879.94]  reminder to not take myself too
[3879.94 --> 3880.38]  seriously.
[3880.38 --> 3884.86]  But the second Sunday on the job,
[3885.64 --> 3887.86]  five minutes before the church
[3887.86 --> 3891.04]  service started, a parent came up to
[3891.04 --> 3893.46]  me and said, I just got a phone call
[3893.46 --> 3896.36]  that a 17-year-old boy from our
[3896.36 --> 3897.94]  church community, from the school
[3897.94 --> 3899.82]  community that we were part of, had
[3899.82 --> 3900.60]  taken his own life.
[3900.60 --> 3909.14]  I didn't know these people, barely.
[3909.62 --> 3911.92]  I didn't know Clayton at all.
[3913.04 --> 3914.70]  And I had to stand in front of them,
[3915.20 --> 3917.26]  and as the first word to them on
[3917.26 --> 3920.10]  Sunday morning, tell them this news.
[3920.10 --> 3926.06]  And in the midst of that, again, I
[3926.06 --> 3926.42]  wept.
[3927.80 --> 3930.04]  I wept for these people that I
[3930.04 --> 3933.00]  didn't know and yet felt such a deep
[3933.00 --> 3935.00]  love for in that moment.
[3937.68 --> 3939.28]  And one of the things that God has
[3939.28 --> 3940.52]  taught me coming out of that
[3940.52 --> 3943.82]  experience is that God can give you a
[3943.82 --> 3945.64]  love for a people you don't know.
[3946.62 --> 3949.00]  That God makes our love possible,
[3949.00 --> 3951.12]  even when we don't feel like it,
[3951.14 --> 3952.28]  even when we don't feel like it
[3952.28 --> 3955.62]  anymore, God can give you that love.
[3958.40 --> 3960.96]  Now these are just some of my stories,
[3961.66 --> 3964.36]  and I didn't go into the details of
[3964.36 --> 3966.08]  many of them deeply.
[3970.30 --> 3972.72]  You have your own stories.
[3973.86 --> 3976.06]  This community, this family, has its
[3976.06 --> 3978.08]  own stories in the death of a friend,
[3978.08 --> 3980.16]  the death of a son, the death of a
[3980.16 --> 3982.02]  father, the death of a baby or a
[3982.02 --> 3982.40]  toddler.
[3983.54 --> 3986.30]  We have stories of aging parents, of
[3986.30 --> 3989.06]  losing mom to dementia five years
[3989.06 --> 3990.34]  before she died of old age.
[3991.62 --> 3994.18]  Stories of chronic illnesses that
[3994.18 --> 3996.14]  medical teams can't seem to figure out
[3996.14 --> 3998.52]  or fix, and we're just barely hanging
[3998.52 --> 3999.82]  on in the middle of it.
[3999.82 --> 4002.98]  These are our stories.
[4003.98 --> 4004.42]  Right?
[4004.50 --> 4006.38]  Each one of us in the life of this
[4006.38 --> 4008.00]  church family right now.
[4008.92 --> 4011.84]  And there's so many more.
[4016.04 --> 4018.16]  And what we do with these stories,
[4018.30 --> 4021.10]  how we tell these stories,
[4021.10 --> 4024.74]  matters for us today.
[4024.74 --> 4030.60]  Psalm 126, verse 5 and 6 says,
[4031.12 --> 4033.96]  Those who sow with tears will reap with
[4033.96 --> 4036.64]  songs of joy, and those who go out
[4036.64 --> 4039.24]  weeping, carrying seed to sow, will
[4039.24 --> 4041.34]  return with songs of joy, carrying
[4041.34 --> 4043.06]  sheaves with them.
[4044.30 --> 4045.38]  Here's what I want you to see.
[4045.48 --> 4046.68]  We'll leave that on the screen for a
[4046.68 --> 4046.82]  minute.
[4046.82 --> 4053.56]  Tears are sown in our stories like a
[4053.56 --> 4055.36]  farmer sows seeds.
[4057.20 --> 4061.28]  And tears, when properly sown, can in
[4061.28 --> 4063.08]  fact bring joy.
[4065.12 --> 4067.34]  But what is important for us to hear is
[4067.34 --> 4070.64]  that it also means it is possible to
[4070.64 --> 4071.86]  waste our tears.
[4072.74 --> 4076.40]  It's possible to throw out our sorrows,
[4076.40 --> 4079.32]  imagine a gardener, right, who
[4079.32 --> 4084.56]  carefully places each seed in the
[4084.56 --> 4086.86]  little hole that they have made,
[4087.14 --> 4092.36]  right, and in six weeks to however
[4092.36 --> 4093.78]  many months, I'm not a gardener, I
[4093.78 --> 4094.94]  don't know how this works, right,
[4095.00 --> 4097.58]  there's fruit, there's plants, there's
[4097.58 --> 4100.08]  beauty, and the miracle of life comes
[4100.08 --> 4100.40]  from that.
[4100.60 --> 4102.66]  Now imagine that same gardener taking
[4102.66 --> 4104.72]  the pile of seeds and just shoving
[4104.72 --> 4105.34]  them on the ground.
[4107.24 --> 4108.26]  That doesn't grow.
[4109.54 --> 4112.08]  It's possible to waste your sorrows.
[4113.22 --> 4117.98]  Tears are like seeds that when sown
[4117.98 --> 4121.68]  properly reap songs of joy.
[4122.14 --> 4124.32]  But here also, as we keep this in front
[4124.32 --> 4127.82]  of us, right, the joy that we might
[4127.82 --> 4132.06]  experience, at least from Psalm 126,
[4132.38 --> 4136.04]  is produced by the sorrow.
[4138.72 --> 4139.50]  Hear that.
[4140.20 --> 4144.56]  It's grown out of the sorrow, right,
[4144.60 --> 4147.24]  that the sadness of grief can make us
[4147.24 --> 4149.44]  more joyful in the long run.
[4149.44 --> 4150.44]  And here's...
[4150.44 --> 4159.14]  I'm going to say this isn't just what I
[4159.14 --> 4160.24]  believe.
[4161.44 --> 4164.54]  This is what I know to be true.
[4166.54 --> 4168.64]  Because of the gospel.
[4170.64 --> 4171.00]  Right?
[4171.00 --> 4173.68]  Because of Jesus' suffering,
[4175.44 --> 4183.44]  ultimate joy is possible and real.
[4184.10 --> 4186.70]  Out of Jesus' suffering,
[4187.14 --> 4189.98]  ultimate joy can come to those who by
[4189.98 --> 4191.30]  grace through faith believe.
[4191.38 --> 4193.10]  Because he lived the life I should have
[4193.10 --> 4194.76]  lived and died the death that I
[4194.76 --> 4194.96]  deserved.
[4195.02 --> 4197.92]  Because he was raised victorious over sin
[4197.92 --> 4199.38]  and death three days later,
[4200.34 --> 4201.88]  because of Jesus,
[4202.96 --> 4207.32]  God has shown us
[4207.32 --> 4211.28]  that he can take what Peter Kreeft
[4211.28 --> 4215.60]  called the world's most awesome
[4215.60 --> 4218.22]  attempt at evil, the killing of God
[4218.22 --> 4222.66]  himself, and turn it into the most
[4222.66 --> 4227.84]  joyful, possible reality for those of us
[4227.84 --> 4228.22]  who believe.
[4228.30 --> 4231.84]  That is the salvation of his people.
[4233.58 --> 4237.50]  And when we can see and hear the
[4237.50 --> 4240.16]  ultimate story of God turning
[4240.16 --> 4242.32]  suffering into joy,
[4242.80 --> 4246.10]  we can begin to hear that in other
[4246.10 --> 4247.06]  stories as well.
[4248.60 --> 4250.52]  So in this series, we have been looking
[4250.52 --> 4252.90]  at God's sovereignty in the midst of
[4252.90 --> 4254.22]  human suffering.
[4254.22 --> 4256.82]  And for so many of us, so often,
[4257.12 --> 4259.86]  our suffering is a challenge to the
[4259.86 --> 4260.94]  sovereignty of God.
[4260.98 --> 4262.74]  But what we are beginning to learn is
[4262.74 --> 4264.64]  that doesn't have to be true for us,
[4264.68 --> 4264.78]  right?
[4264.84 --> 4267.40]  Because God is sovereign, we can endure
[4267.40 --> 4267.98]  suffering.
[4268.32 --> 4270.64]  And God's sovereignty, in fact, is the only
[4270.64 --> 4273.64]  way to ensure that our suffering can have
[4273.64 --> 4274.86]  any meaning.
[4275.02 --> 4277.24]  Any one of those stories that I mentioned
[4277.24 --> 4282.86]  before, the only way I can be sure that God
[4282.86 --> 4285.50]  has a purpose in them while I'm in the
[4285.50 --> 4288.64]  middle of it is if God is sovereign.
[4288.70 --> 4289.96]  Otherwise, it's just a guessing game.
[4291.66 --> 4293.76]  Only on the firm foundation of God's
[4293.76 --> 4296.38]  sovereignty can you have any real hope that
[4296.38 --> 4298.84]  your suffering matters, that it's doing
[4298.84 --> 4300.22]  something, that it has a purpose.
[4300.68 --> 4303.66]  And if God isn't sovereign, everything you go
[4303.66 --> 4306.64]  through might not be necessary, might not be
[4306.64 --> 4307.56]  worth it.
[4310.22 --> 4312.54]  And so in our stories, in the story of
[4312.54 --> 4315.18]  Joseph, we've been looking for God hints.
[4317.10 --> 4320.34]  And in this chapter, in verse 51,
[4321.24 --> 4324.86]  Joseph is blessed with two children.
[4324.86 --> 4328.34]  And it's in the names of those two children
[4328.34 --> 4331.78]  that I want to find our God hint today.
[4332.92 --> 4336.64]  So the first son he has is named Manasseh,
[4336.96 --> 4340.00]  which literally means he caused to forget.
[4340.42 --> 4342.64]  He who brings about forgetfulness.
[4343.66 --> 4346.48]  And it's used here to describe God's activity
[4346.48 --> 4349.18]  on behalf of Joseph and in anticipation
[4349.18 --> 4351.40]  of an even brighter future.
[4352.54 --> 4352.64]  Right?
[4352.64 --> 4354.70]  Joseph realizes here that he doesn't have
[4354.70 --> 4356.82]  to be overwhelmed about the past
[4356.82 --> 4360.80]  or the present because he, in his son,
[4361.10 --> 4364.68]  is being shown a promise for the future.
[4366.46 --> 4369.04]  The other name that Joseph gives here
[4369.04 --> 4371.74]  to his second son is Ephraim,
[4372.04 --> 4373.74]  which literally means fruitful.
[4373.98 --> 4375.62]  Or there's this interesting Hebrew thing
[4375.62 --> 4377.56]  going on there that could mean
[4377.56 --> 4378.74]  doubly fruitful.
[4378.74 --> 4383.36]  And from the perspective of his fruitfulness,
[4383.92 --> 4386.00]  right, from the perspective where Joseph is standing,
[4386.34 --> 4387.82]  hindsight being what it is,
[4388.60 --> 4390.62]  Joseph can see God's hand.
[4391.60 --> 4394.46]  And because he is able to see God working for good,
[4394.56 --> 4396.94]  all the suffering that he had to go through,
[4397.20 --> 4399.74]  his perspective changes.
[4401.12 --> 4402.98]  And so the God hint that I want us to hear
[4402.98 --> 4405.66]  and see out of this is just a little phrase,
[4405.66 --> 4408.80]  seeing the good that comes.
[4410.00 --> 4411.66]  Seeing the good that comes.
[4414.22 --> 4415.64]  And I want you to hear
[4415.64 --> 4421.40]  is seeing the good that comes happens
[4421.40 --> 4427.08]  when we tell stories
[4427.08 --> 4430.74]  of seeing God at work.
[4430.74 --> 4434.26]  That's what our stories do.
[4435.92 --> 4437.36]  But only if you tell them.
[4440.36 --> 4441.36]  Now let me be clear.
[4444.00 --> 4445.44]  Not all of us,
[4446.44 --> 4448.36]  maybe even most of us,
[4449.36 --> 4452.46]  but not all of us
[4452.46 --> 4456.06]  will have a visible good
[4456.06 --> 4457.66]  that comes out of our story.
[4457.66 --> 4459.80]  least of all,
[4459.88 --> 4460.84]  one that we can see.
[4461.84 --> 4462.92]  And especially
[4462.92 --> 4464.40]  when you are in the midst
[4464.40 --> 4465.38]  of the dark night,
[4465.46 --> 4466.20]  when you are in the midst
[4466.20 --> 4467.64]  of the trial of suffering,
[4467.90 --> 4468.80]  when you are in the midst
[4468.80 --> 4470.92]  of crumpled on the driveway
[4470.92 --> 4472.06]  of your house,
[4472.48 --> 4473.50]  crying at the death
[4473.50 --> 4474.22]  of your friend,
[4474.60 --> 4475.92]  seeing anything
[4475.92 --> 4477.16]  in our stories
[4477.16 --> 4477.92]  can be hard.
[4481.48 --> 4482.68]  But that's why
[4482.68 --> 4485.24]  when you are blessed
[4485.24 --> 4486.50]  to see something,
[4486.90 --> 4489.08]  we have to share it.
[4490.70 --> 4491.98]  If you're looking at something
[4491.98 --> 4492.76]  from the perspective
[4492.76 --> 4493.38]  of hindsight
[4493.38 --> 4495.66]  and you can see God's hand
[4495.66 --> 4496.46]  in the midst of it,
[4496.80 --> 4497.66]  tell someone.
[4499.84 --> 4502.04]  Stories of God's transformation
[4502.04 --> 4503.26]  in us
[4503.26 --> 4505.42]  fuel God's transformation
[4505.42 --> 4506.14]  in others.
[4506.56 --> 4508.12]  Stories of God's presence
[4508.12 --> 4509.14]  with us
[4509.14 --> 4511.18]  in those kinds of moments
[4511.18 --> 4513.12]  is God's presence
[4513.12 --> 4513.88]  with us
[4513.88 --> 4515.28]  in other moments.
[4516.84 --> 4517.72]  Now again,
[4518.56 --> 4519.36]  let me be
[4519.36 --> 4520.04]  really,
[4520.28 --> 4521.06]  really clear.
[4522.64 --> 4523.24]  Right?
[4523.30 --> 4524.40]  Because saying
[4524.40 --> 4525.26]  that there is
[4525.26 --> 4526.70]  a good that comes
[4526.70 --> 4528.34]  doesn't mean
[4528.34 --> 4529.88]  the thing that you experienced
[4529.88 --> 4530.46]  is good.
[4531.82 --> 4532.92]  Can we hear that?
[4533.68 --> 4534.80]  Can we understand that?
[4535.80 --> 4536.10]  Right?
[4536.14 --> 4536.94]  It means
[4536.94 --> 4537.64]  that God
[4537.64 --> 4538.50]  is sovereign
[4538.50 --> 4540.04]  and that he can turn
[4540.04 --> 4540.64]  to good
[4540.64 --> 4542.20]  even the greatest evil.
[4542.56 --> 4544.28]  The gospel guarantees that.
[4545.62 --> 4546.46]  It means
[4546.46 --> 4547.00]  that God
[4547.00 --> 4547.64]  is sovereign
[4547.64 --> 4548.58]  and he can bring
[4548.58 --> 4550.44]  glorious and beautiful things
[4550.44 --> 4551.94]  out of brokenness.
[4552.90 --> 4553.00]  Right?
[4553.04 --> 4554.06]  Seeing the good
[4554.06 --> 4554.82]  that comes
[4554.82 --> 4556.48]  is a recognition
[4556.48 --> 4557.76]  that were it not
[4557.76 --> 4558.80]  for that thing,
[4559.08 --> 4559.98]  awful and evil
[4559.98 --> 4560.66]  though it was,
[4560.92 --> 4562.84]  I wouldn't be here
[4562.84 --> 4563.68]  right now.
[4564.36 --> 4565.08]  Seeing the good
[4565.08 --> 4565.66]  that comes
[4565.66 --> 4565.92]  says,
[4566.34 --> 4566.96]  I don't know
[4566.96 --> 4568.36]  what or how
[4568.36 --> 4569.42]  but I know
[4569.42 --> 4570.48]  that he can.
[4573.02 --> 4575.46]  I share these stories
[4575.46 --> 4576.28]  and I invite you
[4576.28 --> 4577.68]  to share your own stories
[4577.68 --> 4580.52]  so that we can see
[4580.52 --> 4582.44]  that God works
[4582.44 --> 4584.84]  with our suffering.
[4584.98 --> 4586.64]  He uses suffering.
[4586.82 --> 4587.96]  God reveals himself
[4587.96 --> 4588.54]  in glory
[4588.54 --> 4589.54]  through suffering.
[4589.96 --> 4591.28]  God can use suffering
[4591.28 --> 4593.44]  to bring great joy.
[4593.44 --> 4595.96]  sowing seeds
[4595.96 --> 4597.18]  with sorrow.
[4598.90 --> 4599.50]  And maybe,
[4599.98 --> 4600.70]  maybe
[4600.70 --> 4602.40]  if you are truly blessed
[4602.40 --> 4603.42]  you will see that
[4603.42 --> 4604.76]  in this life
[4604.76 --> 4605.10]  but
[4605.10 --> 4606.32]  for sure
[4606.32 --> 4608.20]  you will in the next.
[4610.28 --> 4611.34]  Either way
[4611.34 --> 4612.80]  it's good
[4612.80 --> 4615.66]  because he is God
[4615.66 --> 4616.84]  and he
[4616.84 --> 4617.50]  is
[4617.50 --> 4618.32]  good.
[4619.84 --> 4620.94]  And sometimes,
[4621.22 --> 4621.42]  right,
[4621.42 --> 4621.90]  sometimes
[4621.90 --> 4623.96]  we get to know
[4623.96 --> 4625.00]  what and how.
[4626.70 --> 4627.68]  And that's why
[4627.68 --> 4628.32]  it's important
[4628.32 --> 4630.12]  to share these stories.
[4630.98 --> 4632.46]  We don't all have stories
[4632.46 --> 4633.64]  like the ones I shared.
[4633.98 --> 4635.16]  We don't all have stories
[4635.16 --> 4635.42]  of
[4635.42 --> 4637.04]  seeing
[4637.04 --> 4639.22]  good or joy
[4639.22 --> 4639.92]  coming out
[4639.92 --> 4641.48]  of these struggles.
[4642.36 --> 4643.74]  We don't all have stories
[4643.74 --> 4644.28]  of suffering
[4644.28 --> 4645.04]  turned to triumph
[4645.04 --> 4646.00]  or of mourning
[4646.00 --> 4646.68]  turned to joy.
[4646.82 --> 4648.14]  But we all suffer.
[4648.14 --> 4650.58]  And sometimes,
[4650.86 --> 4651.16]  right,
[4651.24 --> 4651.94]  it is just
[4651.94 --> 4652.90]  good
[4652.90 --> 4653.76]  to remember
[4653.76 --> 4654.94]  that God
[4654.94 --> 4656.08]  does bring
[4656.08 --> 4657.20]  good
[4657.20 --> 4658.18]  out of
[4658.18 --> 4659.16]  suffering.
[4659.96 --> 4660.92]  And that's the point
[4660.92 --> 4661.54]  in these stories,
[4661.64 --> 4661.80]  right?
[4662.06 --> 4662.80]  Knowing what
[4662.80 --> 4663.48]  and how
[4663.48 --> 4664.50]  really isn't
[4664.50 --> 4665.20]  the thing here.
[4665.70 --> 4666.44]  It's knowing
[4666.44 --> 4667.04]  that.
[4668.28 --> 4669.16]  Knowing just
[4669.16 --> 4669.84]  how God
[4669.84 --> 4670.28]  will turn
[4670.28 --> 4671.24]  suffering to good
[4671.24 --> 4672.26]  and his glory
[4672.26 --> 4673.58]  isn't ultimately
[4673.58 --> 4674.26]  what matters.
[4674.58 --> 4675.12]  It's knowing
[4675.12 --> 4676.26]  that God
[4676.26 --> 4677.08]  will turn
[4677.08 --> 4677.70]  our present
[4677.70 --> 4678.16]  suffering
[4678.16 --> 4678.98]  to glory,
[4679.10 --> 4679.66]  our present
[4679.66 --> 4680.02]  mourning
[4680.02 --> 4681.10]  to rejoicing.
[4681.58 --> 4682.10]  The tears
[4682.10 --> 4683.00]  will be wiped
[4683.00 --> 4683.32]  away,
[4683.42 --> 4684.22]  either in this
[4684.22 --> 4685.14]  life or in
[4685.14 --> 4685.96]  the next.
[4688.12 --> 4689.06]  And so we
[4689.06 --> 4689.98]  tell stories
[4689.98 --> 4691.12]  as a way
[4691.12 --> 4692.06]  of practicing
[4692.06 --> 4693.44]  and embodying
[4693.44 --> 4694.10]  this truth.
[4695.64 --> 4696.58]  I wanted to
[4696.58 --> 4697.84]  illustrate
[4697.84 --> 4698.68]  why this matters
[4698.68 --> 4699.86]  and this will
[4699.86 --> 4700.64]  land for some of you.
[4700.72 --> 4701.14]  I'll give another
[4701.14 --> 4701.58]  illustration
[4701.58 --> 4702.10]  just to land
[4702.10 --> 4702.80]  for another.
[4704.02 --> 4704.50]  If you ever
[4704.50 --> 4705.26]  watch baseball,
[4705.26 --> 4707.66]  and I'll say
[4707.66 --> 4708.68]  professional baseball
[4708.68 --> 4709.66]  or Aaron Alkema,
[4710.42 --> 4711.44]  when he warms
[4711.44 --> 4711.84]  up,
[4712.76 --> 4712.90]  right,
[4712.94 --> 4713.56]  when professional
[4713.56 --> 4714.32]  baseball players
[4714.32 --> 4714.96]  warm up,
[4715.14 --> 4715.84]  they put this
[4715.84 --> 4716.68]  sleeve on the
[4716.68 --> 4717.06]  end of their
[4717.06 --> 4717.64]  bat or they
[4717.64 --> 4718.26]  grab two
[4718.26 --> 4718.72]  bats,
[4719.14 --> 4719.32]  right,
[4719.36 --> 4720.12]  and they swing
[4720.12 --> 4720.72]  that bat
[4720.72 --> 4722.28]  weighted as it
[4722.28 --> 4722.58]  is,
[4722.98 --> 4723.78]  extra heavy
[4723.78 --> 4724.72]  as it is,
[4724.76 --> 4725.74]  so that when
[4725.74 --> 4726.20]  they get in
[4726.20 --> 4726.94]  the batter's box
[4726.94 --> 4727.32]  and they have
[4727.32 --> 4727.84]  to face the
[4727.84 --> 4728.36]  real thing,
[4728.86 --> 4729.38]  swinging that
[4729.38 --> 4730.22]  stick is easy
[4730.22 --> 4730.72]  as breeze.
[4730.72 --> 4733.36]  you take
[4733.36 --> 4733.82]  on the
[4733.82 --> 4734.74]  extra weight
[4734.74 --> 4735.92]  so that when
[4735.92 --> 4736.50]  you have to
[4736.50 --> 4737.14]  face it,
[4737.84 --> 4738.96]  it's easier
[4738.96 --> 4739.68]  and you're
[4739.68 --> 4739.92]  ready.
[4740.38 --> 4741.08]  That's why we
[4741.08 --> 4741.72]  share stories.
[4742.70 --> 4743.40]  Taking on
[4743.40 --> 4744.10]  each other's
[4744.10 --> 4744.56]  weight,
[4745.70 --> 4746.34]  seeing God
[4746.34 --> 4747.08]  at work.
[4748.12 --> 4748.58]  Another way
[4748.58 --> 4749.22]  to think about
[4749.22 --> 4749.46]  this,
[4750.26 --> 4751.48]  I have a
[4751.48 --> 4752.02]  friend who's
[4752.02 --> 4752.54]  a construction
[4752.54 --> 4752.94]  worker,
[4753.90 --> 4754.58]  and by all
[4754.58 --> 4754.96]  accounts,
[4755.08 --> 4755.46]  the physical
[4755.46 --> 4756.14]  nature of
[4756.14 --> 4756.68]  her job
[4756.68 --> 4757.72]  keeps her
[4757.72 --> 4758.50]  strong and
[4758.50 --> 4759.54]  fit and in
[4759.54 --> 4761.58]  shape because
[4761.58 --> 4762.22]  of the kind
[4762.22 --> 4762.62]  of work she
[4762.62 --> 4763.60]  does for 12
[4763.60 --> 4764.34]  hours a day,
[4764.74 --> 4766.82]  but she's
[4766.82 --> 4767.90]  up at 4.30
[4767.90 --> 4768.68]  every morning
[4768.68 --> 4770.14]  three days a
[4770.14 --> 4770.72]  week in the
[4770.72 --> 4771.80]  gym working
[4771.80 --> 4772.56]  out and
[4772.56 --> 4773.20]  lifting weights
[4773.20 --> 4775.42]  because lifting
[4775.42 --> 4776.30]  those heavy
[4776.30 --> 4776.74]  weights,
[4777.14 --> 4778.18]  lifting those
[4778.18 --> 4779.12]  regular,
[4779.30 --> 4779.72]  those heavy
[4779.72 --> 4779.98]  weights
[4779.98 --> 4781.26]  regularly makes
[4781.26 --> 4782.16]  the everyday
[4782.16 --> 4783.50]  lifting more
[4783.50 --> 4784.04]  manageable.
[4785.26 --> 4786.30]  She can endure
[4786.30 --> 4788.18]  longer as a
[4788.18 --> 4788.52]  result.
[4789.54 --> 4790.64]  That's why we
[4790.64 --> 4791.38]  tell stories.
[4793.14 --> 4793.76]  Now there's
[4793.76 --> 4794.34]  part of me
[4794.34 --> 4795.14]  in these
[4795.14 --> 4795.42]  moments,
[4795.50 --> 4796.36]  I'm sure it's
[4796.36 --> 4796.82]  true for you
[4796.82 --> 4796.98]  too,
[4797.06 --> 4797.38]  that says,
[4798.46 --> 4799.06]  you know,
[4799.28 --> 4800.18]  I would
[4800.18 --> 4801.04]  rather know
[4801.04 --> 4802.20]  exactly what
[4802.20 --> 4803.00]  and exactly
[4803.00 --> 4804.10]  how because
[4804.10 --> 4804.88]  then I'll
[4804.88 --> 4805.28]  know what
[4805.28 --> 4805.66]  I'm looking
[4805.66 --> 4806.10]  for.
[4808.56 --> 4809.20]  But then
[4809.20 --> 4809.66]  there's part
[4809.66 --> 4810.96]  of me that
[4810.96 --> 4811.48]  wonders,
[4811.86 --> 4812.28]  the more
[4812.28 --> 4813.12]  trusting part
[4813.12 --> 4813.68]  of me that
[4813.68 --> 4814.46]  wants to
[4814.46 --> 4814.92]  lean into
[4814.92 --> 4815.28]  God,
[4815.82 --> 4816.02]  right?
[4817.14 --> 4817.82]  Do I
[4817.82 --> 4818.42]  really want
[4818.42 --> 4818.88]  to limit
[4818.88 --> 4820.18]  God in
[4820.18 --> 4820.60]  that way?
[4823.26 --> 4823.78]  Precisely
[4823.78 --> 4824.54]  because I
[4824.54 --> 4824.96]  can't
[4824.96 --> 4825.80]  understand it,
[4826.30 --> 4826.92]  that's why
[4826.92 --> 4827.26]  I have
[4827.26 --> 4827.56]  hope.
[4828.64 --> 4829.18]  Precisely
[4829.18 --> 4829.62]  because it
[4829.62 --> 4829.92]  doesn't make
[4829.92 --> 4830.52]  sense to me
[4830.52 --> 4831.10]  right now
[4831.10 --> 4831.72]  in this
[4831.72 --> 4832.42]  moment and
[4832.42 --> 4832.88]  because I
[4832.88 --> 4833.50]  may never
[4833.50 --> 4834.04]  see,
[4834.30 --> 4834.94]  I can
[4834.94 --> 4835.84]  call on
[4835.84 --> 4836.34]  God my
[4836.34 --> 4836.68]  Father.
[4837.48 --> 4837.62]  Right?
[4837.68 --> 4838.08]  And His
[4838.08 --> 4838.66]  ways are
[4838.66 --> 4839.22]  not my
[4839.22 --> 4839.54]  ways,
[4839.68 --> 4840.14]  nor are
[4840.14 --> 4840.84]  my thoughts
[4840.84 --> 4841.34]  His
[4841.34 --> 4841.66]  thoughts.
[4841.84 --> 4842.18]  And you
[4842.18 --> 4842.52]  know what?
[4843.10 --> 4843.78]  Praise Jesus
[4843.78 --> 4844.36]  for that.
[4846.06 --> 4846.78]  Because if
[4846.78 --> 4847.26]  they were,
[4848.02 --> 4848.70]  you guys
[4848.70 --> 4849.84]  would be
[4849.84 --> 4850.12]  screwed.
[4853.54 --> 4854.26]  Our God
[4854.26 --> 4854.94]  tells us
[4854.94 --> 4855.96]  in 2 Corinthians
[4855.96 --> 4857.70]  4 that
[4857.70 --> 4858.36]  our lights
[4858.36 --> 4859.40]  and momentary
[4859.40 --> 4860.14]  troubles are
[4860.14 --> 4860.96]  achieving for
[4860.96 --> 4861.44]  us an
[4861.44 --> 4862.40]  eternal glory
[4862.40 --> 4863.10]  that far
[4863.10 --> 4863.76]  outweighs
[4863.76 --> 4864.30]  them all.
[4866.06 --> 4866.46]  Here's
[4866.46 --> 4867.32]  what I want
[4867.32 --> 4867.64]  you to hear,
[4867.78 --> 4867.96]  right?
[4868.40 --> 4869.46]  Only from a
[4869.46 --> 4870.70]  perspective of
[4870.70 --> 4871.58]  eternity
[4871.58 --> 4872.96]  can we
[4872.96 --> 4873.72]  say that
[4873.72 --> 4874.20]  our troubles
[4874.20 --> 4875.02]  are momentary.
[4876.36 --> 4877.06]  And only
[4877.06 --> 4877.52]  from a
[4877.52 --> 4878.02]  perspective
[4878.02 --> 4879.00]  that includes
[4879.00 --> 4879.58]  the weight
[4879.58 --> 4880.38]  of glory
[4880.38 --> 4881.20]  can we
[4881.20 --> 4881.78]  say that
[4881.78 --> 4882.22]  our troubles
[4882.22 --> 4882.74]  are light.
[4884.14 --> 4884.88]  But our
[4884.88 --> 4885.56]  story,
[4885.80 --> 4886.94]  our stories,
[4887.30 --> 4888.06]  and therefore
[4888.06 --> 4889.24]  our storytelling
[4889.24 --> 4890.28]  includes
[4890.28 --> 4890.86]  eternity
[4890.86 --> 4892.14]  and includes
[4892.14 --> 4892.84]  God's glory.
[4894.42 --> 4895.00]  And because
[4895.00 --> 4895.52]  of that,
[4895.62 --> 4896.52]  I can see
[4896.52 --> 4897.16]  the good
[4897.16 --> 4898.06]  that comes
[4898.06 --> 4898.92]  in other
[4898.92 --> 4899.42]  stories.
[4899.64 --> 4900.24]  Because I
[4900.24 --> 4900.74]  can see
[4900.74 --> 4901.20]  the good
[4901.20 --> 4901.74]  that comes
[4901.74 --> 4902.22]  in part
[4902.22 --> 4902.74]  of my
[4902.74 --> 4903.22]  story.
[4903.38 --> 4904.42]  Because God
[4904.42 --> 4905.90]  himself promises
[4905.90 --> 4906.44]  that our
[4906.44 --> 4907.50]  present sufferings
[4907.50 --> 4908.14]  are not worth
[4908.14 --> 4908.84]  comparing to
[4908.84 --> 4909.48]  the glory
[4909.48 --> 4910.26]  that will be
[4910.26 --> 4910.92]  revealed in
[4910.92 --> 4911.14]  us.
[4911.32 --> 4912.08]  Because my
[4912.08 --> 4912.98]  God is so
[4912.98 --> 4914.04]  big, so
[4914.04 --> 4915.20]  sovereign, he
[4915.20 --> 4916.32]  is able to
[4916.32 --> 4917.26]  do even
[4917.26 --> 4918.34]  more than I
[4918.34 --> 4919.08]  can ask
[4919.08 --> 4920.18]  or imagine.
[4921.72 --> 4922.66]  And in the
[4922.66 --> 4923.80]  midst of
[4923.80 --> 4924.40]  darkness,
[4925.12 --> 4926.68]  that's the
[4926.68 --> 4927.26]  kind of God
[4927.26 --> 4927.70]  I need.
[4928.70 --> 4928.98]  Amen?
[4929.94 --> 4930.70]  Let's pray
[4930.70 --> 4931.00]  together.
[4931.20 --> 4942.76]  Father God,
[4942.82 --> 4943.38]  we are about
[4943.38 --> 4944.02]  to sing,
[4944.56 --> 4945.70]  though you
[4945.70 --> 4946.76]  slay me,
[4947.82 --> 4948.56]  yet I will
[4948.56 --> 4949.38]  praise you.
[4950.36 --> 4951.18]  Some of us
[4951.18 --> 4952.04]  come to
[4952.04 --> 4952.76]  worship today
[4952.76 --> 4953.48]  feeling pretty
[4953.48 --> 4953.96]  slain.
[4955.24 --> 4956.04]  Some of us
[4956.04 --> 4956.38]  come to
[4956.38 --> 4957.10]  worship today
[4957.10 --> 4958.42]  carrying the
[4958.42 --> 4958.96]  heavy weight
[4958.96 --> 4959.58]  of suffering
[4959.58 --> 4960.28]  and trial.
[4962.50 --> 4963.24]  May we
[4963.24 --> 4963.78]  carry that
[4963.78 --> 4964.42]  into worship
[4964.42 --> 4965.02]  to you.
[4969.48 --> 4970.22]  God, you
[4970.22 --> 4970.80]  have said that
[4970.80 --> 4971.28]  our troubles
[4971.28 --> 4971.92]  are light
[4971.92 --> 4972.88]  and momentary.
[4974.88 --> 4975.84]  And for many
[4975.84 --> 4976.26]  of us,
[4976.30 --> 4976.56]  they don't
[4976.56 --> 4977.28]  feel that
[4977.28 --> 4977.52]  way.
[4980.20 --> 4981.10]  And I pray
[4981.10 --> 4982.20]  today that we
[4982.20 --> 4983.16]  would trust
[4983.16 --> 4984.56]  you and your
[4984.56 --> 4985.80]  word to define
[4985.80 --> 4986.68]  our reality,
[4987.04 --> 4987.92]  not our
[4987.92 --> 4988.60]  feelings or
[4988.60 --> 4989.28]  our perceptions
[4989.28 --> 4989.94]  of it.
[4991.76 --> 4992.92]  That you
[4992.92 --> 4993.80]  and your
[4993.80 --> 4994.82]  word would
[4994.82 --> 4996.06]  define our
[4996.06 --> 4996.94]  experiences.
[4996.94 --> 4997.14]  promises.
[5001.14 --> 5002.12]  And so may
[5002.12 --> 5003.30]  we taste
[5003.30 --> 5006.32]  that eternal
[5006.32 --> 5007.16]  glory that
[5007.16 --> 5007.96]  far outweighs
[5007.96 --> 5008.42]  them all.
[5010.62 --> 5011.62]  And as we
[5011.62 --> 5013.04]  share our
[5013.04 --> 5013.94]  stories,
[5014.94 --> 5015.86]  may you
[5015.86 --> 5016.34]  give us
[5016.34 --> 5017.04]  eyes of
[5017.04 --> 5017.74]  faith to
[5017.74 --> 5018.96]  see you
[5018.96 --> 5020.92]  at work.
[5020.92 --> 5022.40]  in Jesus
[5022.40 --> 5023.04]  Christ we
[5023.04 --> 5023.32]  pray.
[5024.28 --> 5024.60]  Amen.
[5024.60 --> 5024.72]  Amen.
[5024.72 --> 5054.70]  Thank you.
[5054.72 --> 5084.70]  Thank you.
[5084.72 --> 5086.72]  Thank you.

[5246.72 --> 5248.72]  Thank you.
[5248.72 --> 5250.72]  Thank you.
[5250.72 --> 5252.72]  Thank you.
[5252.72 --> 5254.72]  Thank you.
[5254.72 --> 5268.72]  as you go into the stories of faith that God is crafting around you know that God himself
[5268.72 --> 5277.76]  goes with you and in case you didn't hear it go telling the stories of how you've seen God at work
[5277.76 --> 5283.66]  in your care groups your friend groups in your small groups in your work groups
[5283.66 --> 5295.24]  wherever it is tell the story of God at work and go with God receive his blessing for the journey
[5295.24 --> 5305.96]  God go before you to lead you God go behind you to protect you God go beneath you to support you and
[5305.96 --> 5313.48]  God go beside you to befriend you do not be afraid let the blessing of God come upon you today
[5313.48 --> 5323.38]  do not be afraid but go in peace to love and serve the Lord amen

[5625.08 --> 5625.98]  I know.
[5647.76 --> 5649.74]  If you're just trying to remember, I couldn't do anything.
[5655.08 --> 5657.52]  If you're just trying to remember, I couldn't do anything.
[5657.52 --> 5658.52]  I couldn't do anything.
[5658.52 --> 5659.92]  This isn't all anymore.
[5659.92 --> 5660.68]  I'm not sure.
[5660.68 --> 5661.72]  Are you making mistakes?
[5661.72 --> 5663.32]  I'm 100% young.
[5663.32 --> 5664.32]  I'm not sure.
[5664.32 --> 5665.32]  I'm not sure.
[5665.32 --> 5666.92]  I think you've made up this morning, I guess.
[5666.92 --> 5668.42]  I'm not a slut.
[5668.42 --> 5668.92]  I'm not a slut.
[5668.92 --> 5669.42]  I'm not a slut.
[5669.42 --> 5670.42]  I'm not a slut.
[5670.42 --> 5671.42]  I'm not a slut.
[5671.42 --> 5672.42]  I'm not a slut.
[5685.08 --> 5687.12]  I'm not a slut.
[5687.12 --> 5689.60]  I'll not seem to be alright.

[5712.74 --> 5716.06]  Everything said will be made untrue.
[5716.06 --> 5723.38]  And all, it's gonna be a celebration all of creation longs for.
[5723.76 --> 5733.96]  And while we're waiting for that day to come, we've got a little more time to love.
[5733.96 --> 5747.64]  There are little ones hungry for love of a family, and so many hungry for bread.
[5748.12 --> 5753.86]  On the left and the right, surrounded by the last and the least.
[5756.08 --> 5763.82]  And just down the street, and just across the table, hungry hearts are waiting to be fed.
[5764.40 --> 5770.22]  Cause deep in our soul, we're all longing to be at the feast.
[5772.34 --> 5776.52]  But until we sit down, for there's more than enough.
[5776.86 --> 5780.96]  Let us give as we've been given, and love as we belong.
[5782.16 --> 5789.22]  There is a day that is coming, when all the last will be first.
[5789.22 --> 5797.28]  Every orphan will be home, and all will be filled with hunger and thirst.
[5797.28 --> 5804.12]  It's gonna be a celebration all of creation longs for.
[5804.12 --> 5814.90]  And while we're waiting for that day to come, we've got a little more time to do justly.
[5814.90 --> 5820.06]  And love mercy, and show the love we've been shown.
[5820.06 --> 5830.12]  For we can only be the hands and feet of Jesus till He leads us home.
[5830.12 --> 5837.12]  He will lead us home.
[5840.56 --> 5844.04]  There's a day that is coming.
[5844.04 --> 5848.18]  A day that never will end.
[5848.18 --> 5856.02]  There in the light of His glory, everything broken will be whole again.
[5856.02 --> 5863.30]  And this will be the celebration all of creation longs for.
[5863.30 --> 5880.30]  And while we're waiting for that day to come, we've got a little more time to do just a little more time to do.
[5880.30 --> 5894.14]  Love
[5894.14 --> 5900.36]  Just a little more time to love
