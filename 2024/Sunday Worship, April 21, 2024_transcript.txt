[0.00 --> 4.76]  He is refining, and in his timing
[4.76 --> 9.18]  He's making diamonds out of dust
[9.18 --> 13.00]  Making diamonds out of dust
[13.54 --> 16.94]  I won't be afraid to shine
[16.94 --> 21.54]  I won't be afraid to shine
[21.54 --> 25.28]  I won't be afraid to shine
[25.28 --> 29.84]  Cause he's making diamonds out of dust
[29.84 --> 34.68]  Making diamonds out of dust
[34.68 --> 53.02]  I want you as you are, not as you ought to be
[54.28 --> 57.90]  Won't you lay down your guard and come to me
[57.90 --> 63.62]  The shame that grips you now is crippling
[63.62 --> 68.96]  It breaks my heart to see you suffering
[68.96 --> 72.46]  Cause I am for you
[72.46 --> 77.68]  Good morning
[77.68 --> 81.84]  Welcome to worship
[81.84 --> 85.60]  A special welcome if you are a guest here this morning
[85.60 --> 91.52]  We are really excited to gather together in the name of Jesus and to worship him
[91.52 --> 92.88]  My name is Chris
[92.88 --> 95.92]  I am one of the pastors here at Emanuel Church
[95.92 --> 100.48]  And it's my privilege to lead in our shared worship together this morning
[100.48 --> 103.74]  Along with these others on stage who will lead us in song and in prayer
[103.74 --> 110.32]  Before we begin, we have a couple announcements to put in front of you and to remind you of
[110.32 --> 113.22]  And so, hear these
[113.22 --> 117.70]  First of all, this evening, if you're part of our youth program here
[117.70 --> 121.36]  You have 2020 at the church at 630
[121.36 --> 123.76]  If you have no idea what that is
[123.76 --> 125.00]  Talk to Pastor Kevin
[125.00 --> 128.72]  And he will answer your questions and get you involved
[128.72 --> 132.12]  But that's for grade 8 through the end of high school
[132.12 --> 136.42]  Also, the month of April is treat tag
[136.42 --> 138.26]  Oh, good job
[138.26 --> 149.46]  And so, we are surprising and giving small little gifts to other members of our church family here
[149.46 --> 151.60]  And so, I encourage you
[151.60 --> 154.20]  Some of you need to look at your church mailboxes
[154.20 --> 155.64]  Because you've been tagged
[155.64 --> 157.64]  And you don't normally look at your mailboxes
[157.64 --> 160.70]  So, not only do you have a stack of papers and information
[160.70 --> 163.54]  But there's a chocolate bar or something in there as well
[163.54 --> 165.08]  So, please check that if you haven't
[165.08 --> 166.96]  If you don't know what I'm talking about
[166.96 --> 169.56]  You can check it out on social media for our church
[169.56 --> 171.32]  And that should explain some of that
[171.32 --> 175.58]  Additionally, tomorrow evening
[175.58 --> 180.68]  Here, there is an event put on by our deacons
[180.68 --> 184.24]  Who have asked Anya Adama to come
[184.24 --> 187.32]  And to share some stories and practical tips
[187.32 --> 189.98]  For navigating financial stress
[189.98 --> 192.54]  And so, how do we handle these things?
[192.64 --> 194.00]  What are some of the things that we can do?
[194.10 --> 195.22]  Some skill sets to have
[195.22 --> 196.78]  And stories that can be shared there
[196.78 --> 200.24]  So, Anya is going to come and offer that
[200.24 --> 202.42]  And also offer herself to you
[202.42 --> 205.06]  And so, you can set up a time to meet with her
[205.06 --> 206.02]  Or connect with her
[206.02 --> 207.96]  If you have any questions about that
[207.96 --> 210.00]  Some of the deacons are here to answer
[210.00 --> 211.66]  And so, deacons, can you just raise your hands
[211.66 --> 212.48]  Where you are?
[214.00 --> 215.78]  Two, three, one more at the back
[215.78 --> 217.12]  So, if you have any questions
[217.12 --> 218.26]  Grab one of them
[218.26 --> 219.86]  And they will share that with you
[219.86 --> 220.68]  What time does that start?
[222.24 --> 222.60]  Seven
[222.60 --> 223.90]  Seven o'clock tomorrow night
[223.90 --> 227.36]  Next week Sunday
[227.36 --> 229.54]  So, April 28th
[229.54 --> 230.68]  In the evening
[230.68 --> 232.50]  We are hosting here
[232.50 --> 235.36]  One of our evening worship sessions
[235.36 --> 237.26]  And so, at 6pm
[237.26 --> 238.72]  We are going to gather together
[238.72 --> 240.04]  For a worship event
[240.04 --> 240.90]  That we are calling
[240.90 --> 242.02]  Come Holy Spirit
[242.02 --> 243.20]  Where we are going to learn
[243.20 --> 244.74]  And hear about the work of the Spirit
[244.74 --> 245.38]  In our lives
[245.38 --> 246.14]  And in our worship
[246.14 --> 248.70]  And sing in spirit
[248.70 --> 249.80]  And in truth
[249.80 --> 251.44]  And so, we invite you to
[251.44 --> 253.02]  Book that out in your calendar
[253.02 --> 253.82]  And join us
[253.82 --> 255.46]  6pm next week
[255.46 --> 257.28]  And then lastly
[257.28 --> 260.34]  If you are
[260.34 --> 262.88]  If you have been a guest with us
[262.88 --> 264.08]  For some time
[264.08 --> 265.38]  And you are wondering about membership
[265.38 --> 267.32]  Or if you are at this point
[267.32 --> 268.76]  In your relationship to God
[268.76 --> 269.24]  And Jesus
[269.24 --> 270.32]  Where you want to stand
[270.32 --> 271.72]  In front of this church family
[271.72 --> 273.14]  And profess that truth
[273.14 --> 274.98]  And say, yes, this I believe
[274.98 --> 276.66]  Or if you haven't been baptized
[276.66 --> 279.32]  And would like to receive
[279.32 --> 281.44]  That gift of God in grace
[281.44 --> 282.96]  I encourage you to find me
[282.96 --> 283.84]  After the service
[283.84 --> 285.56]  I'll be at the Connect booth
[285.56 --> 287.84]  And we can talk about that journey
[287.84 --> 289.32]  And what that might look like
[289.32 --> 290.76]  Together going forward
[290.76 --> 294.04]  I think that's it for our announcements
[294.04 --> 294.98]  Before we begin
[294.98 --> 297.50]  And so, let's begin our worship together
[297.50 --> 299.88]  By receiving the greeting of God
[299.88 --> 301.10]  God is in this place
[301.10 --> 303.14]  And he welcomes us into his presence
[303.14 --> 303.96]  So I invite you
[303.96 --> 305.22]  As you're able to stand
[305.22 --> 312.10]  When we receive God's greeting
[312.10 --> 313.30]  Not only is it
[313.30 --> 314.64]  God greeting us
[314.64 --> 316.06]  Through my words to you
[316.06 --> 317.86]  But it is God greeting you
[317.86 --> 319.30]  Through your words to each other
[319.30 --> 320.48]  And so following
[320.48 --> 322.62]  My speaking of the greeting
[322.62 --> 324.24]  I invite you to turn to those around you
[324.24 --> 326.16]  And welcome them into worship
[326.16 --> 327.42]  Receive the greeting
[327.42 --> 328.44]  From God
[328.44 --> 330.24]  Grace
[330.24 --> 331.90]  Mercy
[331.90 --> 333.46]  Peace to you
[333.46 --> 334.94]  From God our Father
[334.94 --> 336.40]  From the Lord Jesus Christ
[336.40 --> 336.98]  His Son
[336.98 --> 338.22]  And our Savior
[338.22 --> 339.42]  Through the presence
[339.42 --> 340.16]  And power
[340.16 --> 341.36]  Of the Holy Spirit
[341.36 --> 342.80]  Amen
[342.80 --> 346.20]  Good morning
[346.20 --> 346.90]  Peace of Christ
[346.90 --> 348.08]  Peace of Christ
[348.08 --> 348.50]  Good morning
[363.46 --> 381.10]  We are called to be in this place
[381.10 --> 382.68]  And worship our God
[382.68 --> 384.66]  With these words from Psalm 108
[384.66 --> 385.74]  My heart
[385.74 --> 386.54]  My heart, O God
[386.54 --> 387.90]  Is steadfast
[387.90 --> 389.98]  I will sing and make music
[389.98 --> 391.32]  With all my soul
[391.32 --> 392.54]  Awake
[392.54 --> 393.14]  Heart
[393.14 --> 394.02]  And lyre
[394.02 --> 395.00]  I will awaken
[395.00 --> 395.98]  The dawn
[395.98 --> 397.64]  I will praise you
[397.64 --> 398.08]  Lord
[398.08 --> 398.94]  Among the nations
[398.94 --> 400.40]  I will sing
[400.40 --> 401.26]  Of you
[401.26 --> 402.48]  Among the peoples
[402.48 --> 403.86]  For great
[403.86 --> 404.90]  Is your love
[404.90 --> 406.60]  Higher than the heavens
[406.60 --> 407.96]  Your faithfulness
[407.96 --> 409.50]  Reaches to the sky
[409.50 --> 411.10]  Be exalted
[411.10 --> 412.08]  O God
[412.08 --> 412.94]  Above the heavens
[412.94 --> 414.76]  Let your glory be
[414.76 --> 416.16]  Over all the earth
[416.16 --> 417.30]  Let's sing together
[417.30 --> 435.52]  Thanks to the Lord
[435.52 --> 437.34]  Our God and King
[437.34 --> 440.38]  His love endures forever
[440.38 --> 443.28]  For His purity
[443.28 --> 445.38]  Is above all things

[595.74 --> 611.04]  I am standing beneath your way
[611.04 --> 617.24]  I am resting in your shelter
[617.24 --> 626.74]  Your great faithfulness has given us cheer
[626.74 --> 633.24]  It makes me want to sing

[762.24 --> 764.24]  Blessed be the name of the Lord
[764.24 --> 794.00]  Lord, thank you for your gift of life and being a God of love.
[794.68 --> 800.84]  We have been made in your image, and your word reminds us to love each other as you have loved us.
[801.56 --> 806.78]  But as we think over this past week, we know we have failed to follow that command.
[807.94 --> 815.10]  Forgive us, Lord, when instead of loving people, we choose to love only those who are like us and are easy to love.
[816.28 --> 820.88]  Forgive us when we turn away from people who look different or think differently.
[820.88 --> 824.86]  We know that we cannot love others on our own.
[826.06 --> 831.42]  You tell us that love lays down its life for others, and you show us that on the cross.
[831.78 --> 833.80]  But we are weak and selfish.
[834.86 --> 839.82]  We cannot even lay down our own preferences and rights for others, let alone our lives.
[840.60 --> 841.50]  Teach us, Lord.
[841.50 --> 849.46]  Fill us with your love and compassion for all people, so we have eyes to see those around us in need of love.
[850.22 --> 852.78]  Give us hands and feet willing to reach out.
[853.66 --> 857.60]  Stir us to invite others to use their gifts for your glory.
[858.16 --> 861.34]  As you have loved us, help us to love others.
[861.34 --> 863.28]  In your name we pray.
[863.96 --> 864.30]  Amen.
[864.30 --> 864.48]  Amen.
[891.34 --> 895.58]  Change my heart, O God.
[895.58 --> 900.90]  May it ever choose.
[903.36 --> 907.72]  Change my heart, O God.
[910.12 --> 913.16]  May I be like you.
[915.66 --> 919.78]  Change my heart, O God.
[919.78 --> 949.76]  Make it ever true.
[949.76 --> 979.74]  Change my heart, O God.
[979.74 --> 981.74]  May I be like you.
[981.74 --> 986.74]  May I be like you.
[986.74 --> 993.86]  Please stand with us as we read the words of assurance.
[993.86 --> 999.94]  From Isaiah chapter 55, verses 6 and 7.
[999.94 --> 1000.10] 
[1029.94 --> 1059.92]  Thank you.
[1059.94 --> 1072.86]  My Jesus, I love thee, I know thou art mine.
[1072.86 --> 1085.14]  For thee all the qualities of sin I resign.
[1085.14 --> 1098.38]  My gracious redeemer, my Savior, our God.
[1098.86 --> 1110.14]  If ever I love thee, my Jesus is now.
[1110.14 --> 1126.32]  I know thee because thou hast first ever been.
[1126.32 --> 1138.32]  Then purchase and pardon on Calvary's tree.
[1138.32 --> 1151.74]  I love thee, O every black gold on thy crown.
[1151.74 --> 1163.74]  Here ever I love thee, my Jesus is now.
[1163.74 --> 1173.54]  I love thee in life.
[1173.54 --> 1179.98]  I will love thee in death.
[1179.98 --> 1192.98]  And praise thee as long as thou mendest me breath.
[1192.98 --> 1206.52]  And say when the death do, I scold on my brow.
[1206.52 --> 1218.52]  If ever I love thee, my Jesus is now.
[1218.52 --> 1220.96]  I love thee, my little boy.
[1220.96 --> 1229.32]  And lamentest me lie.
[1229.32 --> 1231.64]  Am I on he?
[1231.64 --> 1243.64]  I'll never adore Him in heaven so proud.
[1243.64 --> 1256.64]  I'll sing with the victory crown of thy crown.
[1256.64 --> 1269.64]  Wherever I love thee, my Jesus is now.
[1269.64 --> 1282.64]  Wherever I love thee, my Jesus is now.
[1286.64 --> 1292.64]  I'll never adore Him in heaven.
[1292.64 --> 1296.64]  I'll never adore Him in heaven.
[1296.64 --> 1301.64]  I'll never adore Him in heaven.
[1301.64 --> 1305.64]  Amen.
[1305.64 --> 1335.64] 
[1335.64 --> 1365.64] 
[1365.64 --> 1395.64] 
[1395.64 --> 1425.64] 
[1425.64 --> 1455.64] 
[1455.64 --> 1457.64]  Amen.
[1457.64 --> 1459.64]  Amen.
[1459.64 --> 1461.64]  Amen.
[1461.64 --> 1491.64] 
[1491.64 --> 1493.64]  Amen.
[1493.64 --> 1495.64]  Amen.
[1495.64 --> 1497.64]  Amen.

[1542.64 --> 1551.64]  Jesus, you will report, the glory is yours.
[1551.64 --> 1561.64]  Behold the Lamb, the story of redemption, waiting on His hands.

[1570.64 --> 1579.64]  We sing your praise, endless hallelujah to your holy name.

[1639.64 --> 1640.64]  Hello belongs!
[1640.64 --> 1650.64]  Yes...
[1650.64 --> 1652.64]  that I came in the morning there at 7 the morning there...
[1652.64 --> 1656.06]  member or whatever it is. She's got lots of little sort of tips and things to think about. So
[1656.06 --> 1659.56]  hopefully we'll see a bunch of us here tomorrow night. And we've invited a bunch of our sister
[1659.56 --> 1663.68]  churches and even some of the neighboring churches so we can hopefully facilitate kind of
[1663.68 --> 1669.48]  probably a common problem or thing that a lot of us face at different times in life. So anyway,
[1669.70 --> 1675.04]  we are also going to take some time in the service now to give of the gifts God has given us
[1675.04 --> 1681.28]  financially. And today's offering is for Open Doors Ministry. It's an organization that has 70 years
[1681.28 --> 1687.76]  of working all over the world helping persecuted or discriminated against Christians, whether that's
[1687.76 --> 1692.96]  getting Bibles through borders or facilitating prayer ministries or small group ministries.
[1693.52 --> 1698.36]  It's a powerful organization. So thank you for giving of your gifts this morning.
[1711.28 --> 1731.62]  We are one in the Spirit. We are one in the Lord. We are one in the Spirit. We are one in the Lord.
[1731.62 --> 1738.06]  And we pray that all unity may one day be restored.
[1738.06 --> 1747.60]  We are one in the Lord. We are one in the Lord. And they'll know we are Christians by our love. By our love.
[1747.60 --> 1753.48]  Yes, they'll know we are Christians by our love.
[1756.48 --> 1766.56]  We will walk with each other. We will walk hand in hand. We will walk with each other.
[1766.56 --> 1777.36]  We will walk hand in hand and together we'll spread the news that God is in our land.
[1778.50 --> 1784.96]  And they'll know we are Christians by our love, by our love.
[1785.20 --> 1790.18]  Yes, they'll know we are Christians by our love.
[1790.18 --> 1800.32]  We will work with each other, we will work side by side.
[1800.32 --> 1806.36]  We will work with each other, we will work side by side.
[1806.54 --> 1812.90]  And we'll mourn each man's dignity and sing each man's pride.
[1812.90 --> 1821.58]  And they'll know we are Christians by our love, by our love.
[1821.70 --> 1826.88]  Yes, they'll know we are Christians by our love.
[1830.60 --> 1836.26]  A praise to the Father from whom all things come.
[1836.26 --> 1842.30]  And a praise to Christ Jesus, His only Son.
[1842.68 --> 1848.68]  And a praise to the Spirit who makes us one.
[1851.32 --> 1857.62]  And they'll know we are Christians by our love, by our love.
[1857.62 --> 1863.62]  Yes, they'll know we are Christians by our love.
[1866.26 --> 1877.20]  Good morning.
[1877.30 --> 1881.34]  I'd like to call the kids up front here, age 3 to grade 4.
[1881.44 --> 1882.22]  Please come on up.
[1882.22 --> 1900.04]  I'm going to say good morning and then you're going to say good morning back real loud, right?
[1900.64 --> 1901.50]  Good morning.
[1901.78 --> 1902.94]  Good morning.
[1904.54 --> 1905.22]  Nice work.
[1905.22 --> 1905.78]  Nice work.
[1906.16 --> 1908.74]  Hey, I got a question for you.
[1908.74 --> 1912.50]  Does anybody know of anything that's really, really sticky?
[1913.96 --> 1914.46]  Yes.
[1915.46 --> 1916.80]  Spider webs are sticky.
[1917.18 --> 1917.38]  Yeah.
[1918.82 --> 1919.50]  What's that?
[1920.32 --> 1921.68]  Some slime.
[1922.60 --> 1923.10]  How about you?
[1924.22 --> 1925.12]  Sticky hands.
[1925.22 --> 1926.76]  I saw some of those on the internet.
[1926.94 --> 1928.72]  I was thinking of those when we were kids too.
[1928.98 --> 1929.36]  Yes.
[1930.26 --> 1930.82]  Jelly.
[1930.82 --> 1933.72]  Sticky tack.
[1934.18 --> 1939.34]  Has anybody here, maybe more of the girls, have you ever gotten any gum stuck in your hair?
[1940.14 --> 1941.56]  How hard is that to get out?
[1942.58 --> 1943.30]  Really hard.
[1943.40 --> 1946.60]  How about gum stuck on the bottom of your shoe?
[1947.30 --> 1948.06]  Ever had that?
[1948.40 --> 1950.12]  And you're carrying it around with you everywhere?
[1950.80 --> 1953.36]  You walk in the house with it and mom's like, I don't think so.
[1953.60 --> 1954.26]  You're out of here.
[1954.26 --> 1959.18]  Well, we're talking today a little bit about God's love, how sticky it is.
[1959.90 --> 1962.78]  How you can't get away from it because he loves you so much.
[1963.78 --> 1967.18]  Has anybody had a chance to look at this artwork on the wall behind us?
[1968.10 --> 1969.06]  Isn't that pretty cool?
[1970.52 --> 1972.36]  Mrs. DeVries put that up for us.
[1972.40 --> 1973.14]  It's pretty awesome.
[1973.30 --> 1973.76]  What do you think?
[1973.82 --> 1976.12]  Anybody got any ideas what that's about up front there?
[1976.38 --> 1977.20]  Anybody got an idea?
[1978.30 --> 1978.74]  Yeah?
[1981.40 --> 1982.72]  Fish sticking together.
[1982.84 --> 1983.34]  That's good.
[1983.34 --> 1985.64]  That's like Christians all sticking together.
[1985.74 --> 1986.18]  That's good.
[1986.26 --> 1986.44]  Yeah.
[1987.24 --> 1987.90]  Do you know?
[1989.88 --> 1991.64]  What do you, do you got an idea what that's about?
[1994.74 --> 1996.22]  A whole school of fish.
[1997.10 --> 2003.40]  This picture up, this artwork up front here is about God, Jesus died on the cross, and
[2003.40 --> 2007.88]  this is us after Jesus died on the cross as Christians, and we're all stuck together by
[2007.88 --> 2012.44]  God's love, and we can go out into the world knowing that God loves us so much.
[2012.44 --> 2014.48]  So I got a question for you.
[2014.54 --> 2016.14]  I got a thing for you guys.
[2016.24 --> 2018.70]  I got a whole bunch of sticky candy in the back.
[2019.46 --> 2023.32]  If one of you guys after church, if any of you can come after church and come to me and
[2023.32 --> 2027.26]  tell me how many fish are on this wall after church, I'll give you a candy.
[2028.22 --> 2028.44]  Okay?
[2028.90 --> 2032.32]  Do you think we should offer that to the adults too, or should they be paying attention to
[2032.32 --> 2033.44]  Pastor Chris this morning?
[2033.44 --> 2034.86]  All right.
[2035.54 --> 2036.58]  Can you guys stand up?
[2036.60 --> 2037.42]  We're going to do the blessing.
[2042.30 --> 2042.66]  Ready?
[2042.66 --> 2045.60]  Lord, be with you.
[2045.92 --> 2047.50]  And also with you.
[2047.50 --> 2048.44]  Amen.
[2065.04 --> 2068.72]  Nothing like a little bribery to get obedience from children, right?
[2068.72 --> 2068.80]  Amen.
[2071.76 --> 2079.84]  It's my privilege this morning to lead in prayer, and that's because the elder who is scheduled
[2079.84 --> 2085.48]  to pray is at home unwell, and so we will add him to our prayer list this morning.
[2086.30 --> 2094.66]  Before we pray, I wanted to maybe situate us in a prayerful context and read to you from
[2094.66 --> 2100.22]  Psalm 84, verse 8, which says, Hear my prayer, Lord God Almighty.
[2100.78 --> 2103.50]  Listen to me, God of Jacob.
[2104.50 --> 2113.00]  And then in James, we read that the prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.
[2114.26 --> 2121.04]  And as Christians, we believe that the Lord Jesus has made us each righteous because he's
[2121.04 --> 2122.66]  granted us his righteousness.
[2122.66 --> 2128.20]  And so our prayers are powerful and effective, not because I've been ordained by the church,
[2128.30 --> 2133.26]  not because I'm holier than any of y'all out there, but because we have been clothed
[2133.26 --> 2134.86]  with Christ Jesus.
[2135.88 --> 2140.88]  And so together we pray powerful and effective prayers.
[2140.88 --> 2149.24]  And so as we come in our prayer together, I want us to come both with the attitude that
[2149.24 --> 2156.32]  cries out in prayer, but also the confidence that the Lord hears our prayer and he acts in
[2156.32 --> 2160.12]  the world according to his grace by our prayers.
[2161.08 --> 2165.74]  Before we pray together, just one announcement.
[2165.74 --> 2169.16]  This is a sad one that has come to us this morning.
[2169.62 --> 2175.02]  In the past while, we have been praying on and off again for Amy Cron, who had been dealing
[2175.02 --> 2175.98]  with lung cancer.
[2177.88 --> 2183.10]  Up until almost two weeks ago, she seemed to be doing well and then took a very serious and
[2183.10 --> 2183.78]  quick turn.
[2183.78 --> 2191.08]  And for the last couple of days had been in intense pain and was in a drug-induced coma
[2191.08 --> 2192.42]  as a result of that.
[2192.62 --> 2196.52]  Well, on Friday evening, she passed away as a result of that.
[2196.60 --> 2202.78]  And so we're going to pray for the Cron family, for the kids and for the extended family and
[2202.78 --> 2208.70]  for the communities of people that have surrounded Amy in this time, that remember her and mourn for
[2208.70 --> 2209.30]  her loss.
[2209.50 --> 2215.96]  And so as we come in our prayers, and as I mentioned that, you are aware of why we're
[2215.96 --> 2216.40]  praying that.
[2216.96 --> 2223.20]  Additionally, this past week, we had the opportunity, a small group of us, to gather on Wednesday
[2223.20 --> 2225.52]  night in a prayer service together.
[2227.06 --> 2233.54]  And so some of the things that I mention, either explicitly or generally, will be shaped
[2233.54 --> 2235.62]  by that time that we spent together.
[2235.62 --> 2243.68]  As we prayed for an hour and 15 minutes or so together, and as other people were leading
[2243.68 --> 2250.62]  us in those prayers, each time someone prayed for a thing or a person by name, the Lord laid
[2250.62 --> 2256.82]  on my heart, you know, three or four or five other people who are in that same situation,
[2257.32 --> 2258.82]  who are walking through that same thing.
[2259.44 --> 2264.38]  And so there's just a lot of stuff, right, that we can bring to God in prayer together.
[2264.38 --> 2269.56]  And so with all of that on our hearts and in our minds, I invite you to join me in our
[2269.56 --> 2270.46]  church family prayer.
[2270.62 --> 2271.06]  Let's pray.
[2278.80 --> 2282.88]  Hear our prayer, O Lord God.
[2284.66 --> 2289.22]  Hear our prayer, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[2289.22 --> 2296.24]  Hear our prayer, God of Samuel, David, and Solomon.
[2299.24 --> 2305.36]  Hear our prayer, God of Isaiah, Amos, and Micah.
[2306.98 --> 2313.24]  Hear our prayer, God of Peter, Paul, and Mary.
[2313.24 --> 2322.34]  Hear our prayer, O God, that we might come into your presence by these words, that you
[2322.34 --> 2328.62]  might draw us to yourself, that you might in the power of your spirit be transforming us
[2328.62 --> 2337.02]  into the image of your Son and our Savior, Jesus Christ, so that these words may be powerful
[2337.02 --> 2343.98]  and effective, so that this moment might be a means by which you act in the world.
[2346.76 --> 2353.06]  Because, Holy Father, as we look out at the world, we see a world in need.
[2353.06 --> 2361.94]  We see nations and communities at war against each other, and so we ask, Lord God, bring
[2361.94 --> 2362.82]  peace.
[2362.82 --> 2371.48]  We pray, Lord God, for tensions in the Middle East, rising in Iran and Syria and Israel.
[2372.00 --> 2378.76]  We pray, Lord God, for these communities that are affected by war, by the decisions of their
[2378.76 --> 2384.90]  leaders, by the work of terrorists, and by the responses of nations and armies.
[2385.18 --> 2388.34]  And we pray, Lord God, protect the vulnerable.
[2388.34 --> 2395.88]  We pray, Lord God, safeguard the children.
[2399.22 --> 2406.80]  And we pray, Lord God, convict those who make decisions not to act out of pride or out of
[2406.80 --> 2411.64]  fear, but to act humbly and to pursue peace.
[2411.64 --> 2422.84]  God, we pray for all involved in these decision processes, not only in places of conflict, but
[2422.84 --> 2431.94]  in the countries that bolster or challenge those conflicts, asking as well that you would bring
[2431.94 --> 2433.04]  peace.
[2433.04 --> 2445.36]  So, Lord God, we join our hearts with Christians around the world, asking that you would protect
[2445.36 --> 2454.84]  those most in need, and that you would save those who cry out for your provision.
[2454.84 --> 2465.56]  Holy God, as we look around the world and see needs for your action, we look also in our
[2465.56 --> 2469.86]  own life and in our own community, and we know that we need you.
[2471.32 --> 2479.16]  This morning, we pray for the Kron family, who is simultaneously in this place of mourning,
[2479.16 --> 2486.54]  mourning the loss of a wife and of a mother and of a friend, and also thankful that her suffering
[2486.54 --> 2487.10]  has ended.
[2489.62 --> 2497.58]  And in this strange oscillation of thankfulness and tearfulness, Lord God, we pray that they
[2497.58 --> 2500.94]  would experience your presence and your peace.
[2500.94 --> 2510.30]  For all those, Lord God, who are dealing with health concerns, who are crying out for healing,
[2510.50 --> 2512.26]  we pray for your hand upon them.
[2513.72 --> 2519.24]  And whether that healing comes through the ordinary means of medicine or through the miraculous
[2519.24 --> 2526.28]  means of moving by your Holy Spirit, we know that all of them are, in fact, brought about
[2526.28 --> 2528.46]  by your providential hand.
[2528.46 --> 2539.80]  And so we pray that we would rest in the assurance that you are with us and that you are able to
[2539.80 --> 2541.02]  bring healing.
[2543.14 --> 2551.10]  And so, God, for those who are crying out for wholeness, we ask for your presence.
[2551.76 --> 2558.44]  For those who are crying out for restoration, we ask, Lord God, that you would grant us,
[2558.46 --> 2559.70]  what they are in need of.
[2564.48 --> 2570.12]  And Lord God, for those in those places, for those journeying through health concerns or
[2570.12 --> 2576.76]  through dark nights of the soul, for those who are crying out in the agony of mental illness,
[2576.76 --> 2585.64]  we pray, Lord God, we pray that if we cannot see you, if we do not see you, that we would see your church.
[2587.58 --> 2594.44]  That our brothers and sisters here would surround us and that in their surrounding us, we might know your nearness.
[2594.44 --> 2606.64]  We pray, holy God, for those who are in ongoing health treatments and concerns.
[2607.80 --> 2610.64]  Restore them and give them peace.
[2610.64 --> 2611.88]  We pray for those who are in need of care.
[2611.88 --> 2612.38]  We pray for those who are in need of care.
[2612.38 --> 2616.00]  We pray for the families who carry the burdens of extra responsibilities
[2616.00 --> 2620.04]  and for the children who wonder, will mom ever be well again?
[2622.66 --> 2627.78]  We pray, Lord God, that you would move in power.
[2627.78 --> 2638.10]  Holy God, we pray as well for the relationships in our midst, the relationships that we are celebrating,
[2638.32 --> 2645.34]  be them anniversaries or birthdays, trusting, Lord God, that your hand of goodness is upon them
[2645.34 --> 2649.58]  and we thank you for the testimonies of faithfulness to each other.
[2649.58 --> 2658.92]  And we pray for those relationships that are strained, that are failing, that have gone past the point of failing and are now broken.
[2659.18 --> 2665.16]  We pray, Lord God, for the people involved who have walked away from loved ones.
[2667.04 --> 2677.36]  We pray for soft hearts, for gentle words, and for humility to one another.
[2679.58 --> 2687.00]  God, we pray that in all of these things, your grace and mercy might abound.
[2688.56 --> 2693.88]  That in all of these things, we might lean heavily on your provision and your word.
[2697.02 --> 2703.86]  Holy Father, we pray for the process of finding new elders and deacons in this church.
[2704.54 --> 2708.42]  We thank you for those who have allowed their name to stand
[2708.42 --> 2713.88]  and for the process that is now in place to move forward in that.
[2714.70 --> 2720.06]  We pray, Lord God, that you would continue by your spirit to lead and guide us.
[2720.54 --> 2722.94]  We thank you for the ways that we have seen that leading
[2722.94 --> 2729.32]  and have followed your guidance in these past days and years and decades.
[2729.32 --> 2734.56]  And we trust going forward that we would follow after you in the same.
[2737.04 --> 2739.74]  Lastly, Lord God, now as we turn to your word,
[2739.90 --> 2745.70]  we pray that you would open the eyes of our heart to hear your voice, Lord Jesus.
[2745.70 --> 2752.90]  And we pray that you would take these words and plant them deep in our hearts
[2752.90 --> 2759.40]  that they might grow and produce a fruit of faithfulness 30, 60, and 100 fold
[2759.40 --> 2761.90]  in us and from us today.
[2763.02 --> 2766.20]  We pray this, Lord, in your most holy name.
[2767.10 --> 2767.46]  Amen.
[2767.46 --> 2767.56]  Amen.
[2767.56 --> 2767.60]  Amen.
[2767.60 --> 2767.62]  Amen.
[2767.62 --> 2767.64]  Amen.
[2767.64 --> 2767.66]  Amen.
[2775.70 --> 2775.90]  Amen.
[2775.90 --> 2776.22]  Amen.
[2776.22 --> 2776.50]  Amen.
[2788.14 --> 2788.20]  Amen.
[2788.20 --> 2798.86]  We're going to jump into the book of Romans again, continuing in the book in chapter 14.
[2798.86 --> 2807.74]  I'm going to start by reading together from verse 1 through 12 of chapter 14.
[2809.14 --> 2814.52]  And this will then ground and direct our discussion for the rest of our time.
[2816.64 --> 2818.92]  Hear these words from God.
[2820.54 --> 2827.66]  Accept the one whose faith is weak without quarreling over disputable matters.
[2828.86 --> 2836.34]  One person's faith allows them to eat anything, but another whose faith is weak eats only vegetables.
[2837.78 --> 2842.86]  The one who eats everything must not treat with contempt the one who does not,
[2843.12 --> 2849.72]  and the one who does not eat everything must not judge the one who does, for God has accepted them.
[2850.98 --> 2854.14]  Who are you to judge someone else's servant?
[2854.14 --> 2862.74]  To their own master, servants stand or fall, and they will stand, for the Lord is able to make them stand.
[2862.74 --> 2867.12]  One person considers one day more sacred than another.
[2867.52 --> 2869.42]  Another considers every day alike.
[2869.84 --> 2873.36]  Each of them should be fully convinced in their own minds.
[2874.36 --> 2877.84]  Whoever regards one day as special does so to the Lord,
[2878.16 --> 2882.36]  and whoever eats meat does so to the Lord, for they give thanks to God.
[2882.66 --> 2886.70]  And whoever abstains does so to the Lord and give thanks to God.
[2886.70 --> 2892.38]  For none of us lives for ourselves alone, and none of us dies for ourselves alone.
[2892.92 --> 2896.80]  If we live, we live for the Lord, and if we die, we die for the Lord.
[2897.24 --> 2901.04]  So whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.
[2902.04 --> 2906.48]  For this very reason, Christ died and returned to life,
[2906.62 --> 2911.52]  so that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living.
[2911.52 --> 2917.60]  You then, why do you judge your brother or sister, or why do you treat them with contempt?
[2917.90 --> 2920.60]  For we all stand before God's judgment seat.
[2920.92 --> 2921.80]  As it is written,
[2922.38 --> 2924.52]  As surely as I live, says the Lord,
[2924.86 --> 2927.06]  every knee will bow before me,
[2927.40 --> 2929.64]  every tongue will acknowledge God.
[2930.32 --> 2935.94]  So then, each of us will give an account of ourselves to God.
[2936.50 --> 2937.84]  This is the word of the Lord.
[2937.84 --> 2937.90]  Amen.
[2941.52 --> 2946.40]  When I was in seminary,
[2947.40 --> 2952.92]  one of the ways that I would sort of supplement our income,
[2953.14 --> 2960.32]  providing a little bit of disposable income for Rachel and I to go out on dates or have fun together,
[2960.74 --> 2964.30]  would be to preach in different communities and different places.
[2964.30 --> 2968.14]  Now, the seminary I went to is in Grand Rapids, Michigan,
[2968.66 --> 2975.48]  which is a pretty major urban center in the Midwest, although not a metropolis.
[2977.22 --> 2983.24]  But it is one of those places in the Midwest that is immediately surrounded by what you would consider to be
[2983.24 --> 2987.26]  stereotypical Midwestern kind of living and culture.
[2987.26 --> 2992.22]  So you've got the more urban and maybe progressive area of Grand Rapids,
[2992.28 --> 2998.26]  and then the more rural and definitely conservative areas around Grand Rapids.
[2998.26 --> 3002.02]  And because those churches were generally smaller,
[3002.28 --> 3005.60]  they were the ones who needed pulpit supply and who needed preaching more often.
[3006.52 --> 3009.86]  And so, after my first year of seminary,
[3009.96 --> 3011.90]  I spent basically the next two years,
[3012.20 --> 3015.44]  two or three of the four Sundays of a month,
[3015.84 --> 3017.22]  driving somewhere and preaching,
[3017.68 --> 3018.56]  if not in the morning,
[3018.70 --> 3021.96]  then for sure at these churches in their afternoon services.
[3021.96 --> 3025.94]  Now, when I would go to these churches,
[3026.22 --> 3028.12]  understanding a little bit about the culture,
[3028.64 --> 3032.30]  I would put on my suit and my tie,
[3033.22 --> 3036.44]  and I would go and I would show up to preach.
[3036.56 --> 3037.34]  And I will never forget,
[3037.46 --> 3043.04]  there was one Sunday I showed up at a small little church just outside of Grand Rapids,
[3043.04 --> 3047.50]  and this little old Dutch lady came up to me and said,
[3047.50 --> 3052.32]  oh, it is so good to see the domine wearing a suit.
[3053.74 --> 3054.88]  If you are unaware,
[3055.22 --> 3059.88]  domine is the word for minister in Dutch culture,
[3059.88 --> 3061.92]  and it's kind of become a bit of a meme.
[3064.74 --> 3065.64]  And then she said,
[3066.06 --> 3070.92]  so many of you seminary kids come wearing just casual clothes.
[3071.96 --> 3073.68]  Now, if she could only see me now.
[3073.68 --> 3078.80]  Point is,
[3078.94 --> 3080.34]  it mattered for her
[3080.34 --> 3082.56]  what the pastor wore.
[3083.36 --> 3086.58]  Now, I know that I'm standing on the line for some of you
[3086.58 --> 3088.42]  that it matters for you as well
[3088.42 --> 3091.18]  what the pastor wears or what you wear to church,
[3091.24 --> 3092.62]  and we'll come back to that.
[3093.46 --> 3094.32]  But for her,
[3094.72 --> 3095.90]  it was a point.
[3096.70 --> 3098.48]  And to the point where
[3098.48 --> 3100.68]  she required it of the people
[3100.68 --> 3102.78]  in front of her in order for her to hear
[3102.78 --> 3104.80]  the word of God from that person.
[3106.32 --> 3107.66]  Now, I understood that.
[3108.00 --> 3109.52]  I also realized,
[3109.66 --> 3110.88]  looking back on that moment,
[3111.00 --> 3112.54]  that if she had only knew
[3112.54 --> 3114.24]  that I had cobbled together this suit,
[3114.28 --> 3115.78]  it was the suit I got married in.
[3115.82 --> 3118.04]  It was probably a size or three too big.
[3118.60 --> 3120.02]  The tie that I was wearing
[3120.02 --> 3122.70]  was from the clothing shelter.
[3123.02 --> 3124.86]  We were part of a food bank system,
[3125.00 --> 3127.08]  and we got ties that other people had donated.
[3127.66 --> 3129.52]  Someone probably died in that tie,
[3129.62 --> 3131.20]  but no, it was my fancy tie.
[3131.20 --> 3133.12]  There I was, doing my best.
[3136.42 --> 3138.06]  Here's what happens, right?
[3139.12 --> 3141.22]  Churches create cultures
[3141.22 --> 3143.30]  about these kinds of things,
[3143.30 --> 3145.82]  and then cultures create rules
[3145.82 --> 3148.38]  to instantiate those kinds of things,
[3148.50 --> 3150.68]  and then rules create boundaries
[3150.68 --> 3152.74]  that define whether or not
[3152.74 --> 3154.40]  you are in or out
[3154.40 --> 3156.26]  or belong to who we are.
[3156.26 --> 3160.80]  That's what we're talking about this morning.
[3161.96 --> 3162.86]  And so, trigger warning,
[3163.56 --> 3165.72]  some of you are going to be like,
[3165.78 --> 3166.86]  ah, is he talking about me?
[3167.38 --> 3169.18]  And others of you are going to be like,
[3169.34 --> 3170.78]  oh yeah, he's talking about them.
[3171.54 --> 3172.34]  And if that's you,
[3172.40 --> 3173.46]  I want you to invert it.
[3173.94 --> 3175.50]  Because if you think I'm talking about someone else,
[3175.56 --> 3176.56]  no, I'm actually talking about you.
[3177.42 --> 3178.72]  And if you think I'm talking about you,
[3178.78 --> 3180.34]  I'm probably talking about someone else.
[3180.34 --> 3182.58]  But you need to hear,
[3183.04 --> 3183.94]  and you need to discern.
[3185.18 --> 3186.52]  Here's what I hope we'll see
[3186.52 --> 3189.90]  as we dig into this text for us,
[3190.04 --> 3191.36]  from Romans 14.
[3192.34 --> 3194.52]  That living for the Lord
[3194.52 --> 3198.38]  requires us to mature in our faith,
[3198.94 --> 3201.32]  and then to come alongside those
[3201.32 --> 3204.28]  who are maturing where they are at,
[3204.28 --> 3208.24]  so that we might grow in faith together.
[3209.84 --> 3211.10]  Now, I'm very mindful
[3211.10 --> 3212.76]  in the way that that sentence reads
[3212.76 --> 3215.34]  that we haven't decided anything yet
[3215.34 --> 3216.80]  about the kind of clothes you wear to church.
[3218.32 --> 3219.22]  That's intentional.
[3220.48 --> 3221.32]  Follow along.
[3224.00 --> 3227.12]  So, in Romans chapter 1 through 11,
[3227.46 --> 3230.04]  where we spent over a year together,
[3230.16 --> 3232.64]  Paul is explaining for us
[3232.64 --> 3234.60]  the majesty and the magnitude
[3234.60 --> 3236.04]  of the gospel
[3236.04 --> 3238.06]  that is summarized
[3238.06 --> 3239.82]  and that we are justified,
[3240.20 --> 3240.96]  we are received,
[3241.26 --> 3242.98]  we are made right with God
[3242.98 --> 3244.06]  by grace alone,
[3244.24 --> 3245.24]  through faith alone,
[3245.58 --> 3246.74]  in Christ alone.
[3247.80 --> 3250.00]  Paul grounds our need
[3250.00 --> 3251.96]  for grace and the gospel
[3251.96 --> 3252.92]  in the rebellion
[3252.92 --> 3255.38]  of our first parents,
[3255.52 --> 3256.24]  Adam and Eve,
[3256.34 --> 3256.92]  in the garden.
[3257.28 --> 3258.66]  They rebelled against God,
[3258.76 --> 3259.76]  and in the consequence
[3259.76 --> 3260.82]  and the reality
[3260.82 --> 3261.56]  that is now
[3261.56 --> 3263.32]  sin in the world for us.
[3263.42 --> 3265.26]  He clearly spells this out.
[3266.00 --> 3266.76]  He shows us
[3266.76 --> 3268.38]  how Christ is the only true
[3268.38 --> 3269.42]  and better sacrifice
[3269.42 --> 3271.20]  who has borne the wrath of God
[3271.20 --> 3272.04]  for sin
[3272.04 --> 3273.60]  and has set us free
[3273.60 --> 3275.26]  from the tyranny of the devil.
[3275.40 --> 3276.08]  He talks about
[3276.08 --> 3277.54]  how we are loved of God
[3277.54 --> 3278.42]  so much so
[3278.42 --> 3279.94]  that we can call him Father,
[3280.70 --> 3280.82]  right,
[3280.84 --> 3281.60]  how there's nothing
[3281.60 --> 3282.84]  that can separate us
[3282.84 --> 3283.96]  from this love.
[3284.12 --> 3285.24]  And then he spends
[3285.24 --> 3286.18]  three chapters
[3286.18 --> 3287.94]  narrowing that discussion
[3287.94 --> 3288.94]  of God's grace
[3288.94 --> 3289.96]  and God's sovereignty
[3289.96 --> 3291.34]  to the people of Israel
[3291.34 --> 3293.10]  and how he relates to them.
[3293.70 --> 3295.06]  And then in chapter 12,
[3295.60 --> 3297.64]  he starts applying
[3297.64 --> 3299.56]  the truth of this gospel,
[3300.36 --> 3301.12]  that we are justified
[3301.12 --> 3302.00]  by grace alone,
[3302.10 --> 3302.78]  through faith alone,
[3302.84 --> 3303.66]  in Christ alone,
[3303.78 --> 3305.72]  to the lives of those
[3305.72 --> 3307.30]  who have been transformed by it.
[3308.12 --> 3309.50]  And so he shifts, right?
[3309.54 --> 3309.74]  He says,
[3309.82 --> 3311.58]  this now is how you should live
[3311.58 --> 3312.74]  in response
[3312.74 --> 3313.78]  and in gratitude
[3313.78 --> 3315.42]  to what God has done.
[3315.42 --> 3316.84]  And so here,
[3316.98 --> 3317.60]  we talked about
[3317.60 --> 3318.58]  being transformed,
[3318.80 --> 3319.88]  about offering ourselves
[3319.88 --> 3321.72]  as living sacrifices,
[3321.72 --> 3322.96]  about worshiping God
[3322.96 --> 3323.62]  in the everyday
[3323.62 --> 3325.32]  of our lives.
[3325.40 --> 3325.58]  Here,
[3325.66 --> 3326.30]  we talked about
[3326.30 --> 3327.80]  loving our neighbors
[3327.80 --> 3329.00]  and blessing those
[3329.00 --> 3330.22]  who persecute you,
[3330.58 --> 3331.86]  rejoicing with those
[3331.86 --> 3332.44]  who rejoice
[3332.44 --> 3333.68]  and mourning with those
[3333.68 --> 3334.34]  who mourn,
[3334.56 --> 3335.84]  about living in harmony
[3335.84 --> 3336.72]  with everyone.
[3337.98 --> 3338.78]  The application
[3338.78 --> 3340.90]  of this gospel truth
[3340.90 --> 3341.78]  is seen
[3341.78 --> 3343.20]  in the idea
[3343.20 --> 3344.40]  of God's sovereignty
[3344.40 --> 3346.22]  over all that is
[3346.22 --> 3346.82]  in creation,
[3346.96 --> 3347.74]  but then also
[3347.74 --> 3348.90]  in God placing
[3348.90 --> 3349.92]  certain other
[3349.92 --> 3351.32]  sovereign authorities
[3351.32 --> 3353.44]  in the created order
[3353.44 --> 3354.50]  that we are subject to.
[3355.42 --> 3356.02]  And then,
[3356.16 --> 3357.88]  part of our Christian witness,
[3358.18 --> 3358.40]  right,
[3358.46 --> 3359.50]  is the manner
[3359.50 --> 3360.98]  by which we willingly
[3360.98 --> 3362.08]  subject ourselves
[3362.08 --> 3363.52]  to these authorities.
[3364.76 --> 3365.06]  Paul said,
[3365.26 --> 3365.98]  give to everyone
[3365.98 --> 3366.68]  what you owe.
[3366.82 --> 3367.44]  If taxes,
[3367.58 --> 3368.12]  pay taxes.
[3368.28 --> 3368.80]  If revenue,
[3368.96 --> 3369.42]  then revenue.
[3369.58 --> 3370.08]  If respect,
[3370.20 --> 3370.62]  then respect.
[3370.80 --> 3371.26]  If honor,
[3371.38 --> 3372.12]  then honor.
[3372.24 --> 3372.54]  And then,
[3372.54 --> 3373.82]  this is what it means
[3373.82 --> 3375.68]  to love our neighbor.
[3376.88 --> 3377.00]  Right,
[3377.06 --> 3378.74]  understanding all of this
[3378.74 --> 3379.52]  makes sense
[3379.52 --> 3380.90]  of the world we live in
[3380.90 --> 3381.80]  and how we are
[3381.80 --> 3382.64]  to live in the world.
[3383.48 --> 3384.50]  We clothe ourselves
[3384.50 --> 3385.38]  with Christ,
[3385.60 --> 3386.52]  putting on the armor
[3386.52 --> 3387.52]  of light.
[3388.16 --> 3388.72]  That's what we looked
[3388.72 --> 3389.34]  at last week.
[3390.26 --> 3390.94]  And now,
[3391.12 --> 3392.28]  in chapter 14,
[3393.24 --> 3394.04]  it seems
[3394.04 --> 3394.84]  that what Paul
[3394.84 --> 3395.48]  is doing
[3395.48 --> 3396.62]  is applying
[3396.62 --> 3398.34]  this gospel truth
[3398.34 --> 3399.86]  and applying
[3399.86 --> 3400.94]  these general
[3400.94 --> 3401.80]  applications
[3401.80 --> 3404.00]  to a particular
[3404.00 --> 3404.96]  situation
[3404.96 --> 3406.54]  in the church
[3406.54 --> 3407.46]  at Rome.
[3408.78 --> 3409.50]  Right,
[3409.50 --> 3410.08]  he's applying
[3410.08 --> 3411.32]  these Christ-centered
[3411.32 --> 3412.44]  living principles
[3412.44 --> 3415.02]  to a very
[3415.02 --> 3416.34]  precise
[3416.34 --> 3418.36]  circumstance
[3418.36 --> 3420.02]  that they're facing.
[3420.82 --> 3421.74]  Because you see,
[3422.14 --> 3423.28]  the church of Rome
[3423.28 --> 3424.56]  is made up
[3424.56 --> 3426.02]  of both
[3426.02 --> 3427.50]  Jewish converts
[3427.50 --> 3429.78]  to Christianity,
[3429.78 --> 3430.78]  Christianity,
[3430.78 --> 3431.12]  to Jesus,
[3431.12 --> 3432.44]  and non-Jewish
[3432.44 --> 3433.36]  or Gentile
[3433.36 --> 3434.06]  converts
[3434.06 --> 3435.28]  to Christianity.
[3436.36 --> 3436.68]  And so,
[3436.76 --> 3437.52]  part of what that
[3437.52 --> 3438.02]  means
[3438.02 --> 3439.02]  is you have a
[3439.02 --> 3439.60]  strong,
[3439.92 --> 3440.76]  committed group
[3440.76 --> 3441.46]  of people
[3441.46 --> 3442.34]  who have,
[3442.56 --> 3443.58]  for their entire
[3443.58 --> 3444.32]  history
[3444.32 --> 3445.48]  of knowing
[3445.48 --> 3446.44]  and believing
[3446.44 --> 3447.26]  in God,
[3447.38 --> 3448.16]  have also
[3448.16 --> 3448.78]  understood
[3448.78 --> 3449.88]  that this is
[3449.88 --> 3450.78]  what that means.
[3451.46 --> 3452.36]  This is how
[3452.36 --> 3453.06]  that looks.
[3453.64 --> 3454.48]  This is how
[3454.48 --> 3454.94]  you're supposed
[3454.94 --> 3455.42]  to live
[3455.42 --> 3456.34]  that faith out.
[3456.34 --> 3456.62]  right.
[3457.58 --> 3457.82]  Right,
[3457.88 --> 3458.52]  this is what
[3458.52 --> 3459.44]  right obedience
[3459.44 --> 3460.20]  looks like.
[3460.86 --> 3461.52]  And then in the
[3461.52 --> 3462.32]  same church,
[3462.34 --> 3463.02]  you have a group
[3463.02 --> 3463.66]  of people
[3463.66 --> 3464.38]  who have come
[3464.38 --> 3464.94]  to believe
[3464.94 --> 3465.56]  in Jesus
[3465.56 --> 3466.46]  and in the gospel
[3466.46 --> 3467.68]  who don't have
[3467.68 --> 3468.40]  that history,
[3468.66 --> 3469.68]  who aren't shaped
[3469.68 --> 3470.90]  in that same way,
[3471.06 --> 3472.02]  but rather have
[3472.02 --> 3472.92]  other histories
[3472.92 --> 3474.02]  and other shaping
[3474.02 --> 3474.74]  realities.
[3476.24 --> 3476.42]  Right,
[3476.46 --> 3476.96]  in essence,
[3477.08 --> 3477.98]  what's going on
[3477.98 --> 3478.98]  is a sort of
[3478.98 --> 3480.34]  clash of cultures
[3480.34 --> 3481.62]  in this new
[3481.62 --> 3482.92]  cultural creation
[3482.92 --> 3483.82]  that is the
[3483.82 --> 3485.00]  Christian church.
[3485.00 --> 3485.06]  church.
[3486.34 --> 3487.38]  And for those
[3487.38 --> 3487.94]  who are born
[3487.94 --> 3488.62]  and raised
[3488.62 --> 3489.24]  in the Jewish
[3489.24 --> 3489.84]  tradition,
[3490.40 --> 3491.54]  who have certain
[3491.54 --> 3492.42]  rules about
[3492.42 --> 3493.08]  what foods
[3493.08 --> 3493.70]  you are allowed
[3493.70 --> 3494.30]  to eat or
[3494.30 --> 3494.92]  not allowed
[3494.92 --> 3495.38]  to eat,
[3495.64 --> 3496.34]  certain rules
[3496.34 --> 3497.10]  around holy
[3497.10 --> 3498.22]  days and festivals
[3498.22 --> 3499.04]  and things like
[3499.04 --> 3499.32]  that,
[3499.60 --> 3500.70]  all of those
[3500.70 --> 3501.38]  things have
[3501.38 --> 3502.30]  shaped them
[3502.30 --> 3503.32]  and are important
[3503.32 --> 3503.88]  to them.
[3504.36 --> 3504.46]  Right,
[3504.52 --> 3504.96]  these things
[3504.96 --> 3505.52]  are their
[3505.52 --> 3506.82]  expressions of
[3506.82 --> 3507.26]  faith.
[3508.18 --> 3508.96]  But for the
[3508.96 --> 3509.60]  Gentiles who
[3509.60 --> 3510.66]  don't have that,
[3510.84 --> 3511.56]  who don't have
[3511.56 --> 3512.18]  that history,
[3512.64 --> 3513.52]  and then who also
[3513.52 --> 3514.46]  have no desire
[3514.46 --> 3515.30]  to incorporate
[3515.30 --> 3516.04]  that history
[3516.04 --> 3516.78]  into their
[3516.78 --> 3517.58]  expressions of
[3517.58 --> 3517.90]  faith,
[3519.28 --> 3520.34]  conflicts arise.
[3521.72 --> 3521.98]  Right,
[3522.00 --> 3522.46]  or to put it
[3522.46 --> 3523.06]  in today's
[3523.06 --> 3523.56]  language,
[3523.92 --> 3524.98]  into the
[3524.98 --> 3525.88]  lived experience
[3525.88 --> 3526.50]  of these
[3526.50 --> 3527.56]  polarities,
[3528.12 --> 3530.46]  you have
[3530.46 --> 3531.02]  disputes.
[3532.18 --> 3533.00]  And Paul
[3533.00 --> 3534.12]  applies for us
[3534.12 --> 3534.66]  the gospel
[3534.66 --> 3535.84]  truths and
[3535.84 --> 3536.68]  shows us
[3536.68 --> 3537.62]  what transformed
[3537.62 --> 3538.28]  lives will
[3538.28 --> 3539.04]  look like
[3539.04 --> 3540.30]  in a church
[3540.30 --> 3541.40]  like Rome.
[3542.52 --> 3542.90]  Now,
[3542.96 --> 3543.16]  of course,
[3543.16 --> 3543.60]  in our own
[3543.60 --> 3543.98]  time,
[3544.16 --> 3544.80]  we have
[3544.80 --> 3545.60]  our own
[3545.60 --> 3546.36]  range of
[3546.36 --> 3547.12]  polarities.
[3548.14 --> 3548.40]  Right,
[3548.44 --> 3548.70]  in the
[3548.70 --> 3549.22]  contemporary
[3549.22 --> 3550.12]  church,
[3550.18 --> 3550.62]  we're not
[3550.62 --> 3551.22]  immune to
[3551.22 --> 3551.60]  this.
[3552.12 --> 3552.68]  And even
[3552.68 --> 3553.40]  here at
[3553.40 --> 3553.78]  Langley
[3553.78 --> 3554.20]  Emanuel,
[3554.20 --> 3555.00]  we're really
[3555.00 --> 3555.40]  good at
[3555.40 --> 3555.82]  a lot,
[3555.94 --> 3556.58]  we're also
[3556.58 --> 3557.08]  not immune
[3557.08 --> 3557.64]  to this.
[3558.78 --> 3559.18]  And so we
[3559.18 --> 3559.48]  can learn
[3559.48 --> 3559.80]  from this
[3559.80 --> 3560.12]  kind of
[3560.12 --> 3560.44]  teaching.
[3562.06 --> 3562.70]  I think
[3562.70 --> 3563.28]  the line
[3563.28 --> 3563.74]  that Paul
[3563.74 --> 3564.38]  takes us
[3564.38 --> 3564.74]  through
[3564.74 --> 3565.74]  is actually
[3565.74 --> 3566.68]  pretty linear,
[3567.18 --> 3567.64]  and so we're
[3567.64 --> 3568.02]  going to move
[3568.02 --> 3568.58]  through that
[3568.58 --> 3569.70]  in a
[3569.70 --> 3570.22]  similar
[3570.22 --> 3571.18]  way.
[3571.70 --> 3572.02]  And so
[3572.02 --> 3573.60]  if you
[3573.60 --> 3573.88]  have a
[3573.88 --> 3574.14]  Bible,
[3574.34 --> 3574.74]  I encourage
[3574.74 --> 3575.00]  you to
[3575.00 --> 3575.38]  keep that
[3575.38 --> 3575.68]  in front
[3575.68 --> 3575.96]  of you
[3575.96 --> 3576.74]  and open.
[3577.42 --> 3577.76]  You can
[3577.76 --> 3578.70]  trace the
[3578.70 --> 3579.10]  line that
[3579.10 --> 3579.38]  we go
[3579.38 --> 3579.66]  through.
[3579.86 --> 3580.16]  Some of
[3580.16 --> 3580.48]  the things
[3580.48 --> 3581.00]  will appear
[3581.00 --> 3581.42]  on the
[3581.42 --> 3581.66]  screen
[3581.66 --> 3582.16]  behind me
[3582.16 --> 3582.52]  to help
[3582.52 --> 3582.76]  you in
[3582.76 --> 3583.18]  doing that.
[3584.68 --> 3584.90]  Paul
[3584.90 --> 3585.32]  begins
[3585.32 --> 3586.52]  by saying,
[3586.52 --> 3587.32]  accept the
[3587.32 --> 3587.88]  one whose
[3587.88 --> 3588.46]  faith is
[3588.46 --> 3589.62]  weak without
[3589.62 --> 3590.68]  quarreling over
[3590.68 --> 3591.42]  disputable
[3591.42 --> 3592.40]  matters.
[3592.40 --> 3594.20]  Now the
[3594.20 --> 3594.72]  first thing
[3594.72 --> 3595.22]  to wonder
[3595.22 --> 3596.34]  is to
[3596.34 --> 3596.92]  look at
[3596.92 --> 3597.44]  what Paul
[3597.44 --> 3598.88]  means when
[3598.88 --> 3599.28]  he talks
[3599.28 --> 3599.96]  about weak
[3599.96 --> 3600.66]  faith.
[3601.68 --> 3602.14]  Who is
[3602.14 --> 3602.52]  the one
[3602.52 --> 3603.12]  with weak
[3603.12 --> 3603.96]  faith?
[3604.60 --> 3605.42]  Because that
[3605.42 --> 3605.84]  doesn't
[3605.84 --> 3606.44]  necessarily
[3606.44 --> 3607.26]  mean what
[3607.26 --> 3607.62]  you might
[3607.62 --> 3608.02]  think it
[3608.02 --> 3608.30]  does.
[3609.50 --> 3610.02]  So weak
[3610.02 --> 3610.76]  faith in
[3610.76 --> 3611.90]  chapter 14,
[3612.36 --> 3612.98]  for instance,
[3613.08 --> 3613.90]  is not the
[3613.90 --> 3614.66]  same thing
[3614.66 --> 3615.42]  as what you
[3615.42 --> 3615.82]  might call
[3615.82 --> 3616.30]  feeble
[3616.30 --> 3616.74]  faith.
[3617.96 --> 3618.76]  In chapter
[3618.76 --> 3620.10]  4,
[3620.24 --> 3621.08]  verse 19,
[3621.28 --> 3621.96]  Paul talks
[3621.96 --> 3622.30]  about
[3622.30 --> 3623.12]  Abraham,
[3623.44 --> 3623.68]  and he
[3623.68 --> 3624.02]  says,
[3624.14 --> 3624.66]  Abraham,
[3625.04 --> 3625.92]  not
[3625.92 --> 3626.80]  weakening
[3626.80 --> 3627.68]  his faith.
[3629.00 --> 3629.40]  And the
[3629.40 --> 3629.78]  point there
[3629.78 --> 3630.04]  is that
[3630.04 --> 3630.36]  Abraham
[3630.36 --> 3630.86]  didn't
[3630.86 --> 3631.28]  lose
[3631.28 --> 3631.88]  trust.
[3632.28 --> 3632.50]  He
[3632.50 --> 3632.82]  didn't
[3632.82 --> 3633.30]  lose
[3633.30 --> 3633.92]  faith.
[3634.50 --> 3634.80]  A
[3634.80 --> 3635.10]  weak
[3635.10 --> 3635.56]  faith,
[3635.60 --> 3635.90]  or a
[3635.90 --> 3636.24]  weakened
[3636.24 --> 3636.80]  faith,
[3636.94 --> 3637.48]  in chapter
[3637.48 --> 3638.02]  4,
[3638.34 --> 3639.44]  is losing
[3639.44 --> 3640.00]  trust.
[3640.34 --> 3640.68]  But that's
[3640.68 --> 3641.18]  not what
[3641.18 --> 3641.54]  we're talking
[3641.54 --> 3642.04]  about here.
[3642.68 --> 3643.14]  That's not
[3643.14 --> 3643.48]  the same
[3643.48 --> 3643.84]  thing.
[3644.36 --> 3645.18]  The person
[3645.18 --> 3645.56]  with a
[3645.56 --> 3645.80]  weak
[3645.80 --> 3646.30]  faith in
[3646.30 --> 3647.18]  chapter 14
[3647.18 --> 3649.08]  is something
[3649.08 --> 3649.60]  else.
[3651.08 --> 3651.82]  And I
[3651.82 --> 3652.46]  think that
[3652.46 --> 3653.78]  when Paul's
[3653.78 --> 3654.38]  talking about
[3654.38 --> 3655.06]  a weak
[3655.06 --> 3656.02]  faith in
[3656.02 --> 3657.00]  chapter 14,
[3657.20 --> 3657.70]  what he
[3657.70 --> 3658.94]  means is
[3658.94 --> 3659.32]  that it's
[3659.32 --> 3659.86]  a faith
[3659.86 --> 3660.72]  that hasn't
[3660.72 --> 3661.68]  worked its
[3661.68 --> 3662.48]  way into
[3662.48 --> 3663.10]  the corners
[3663.10 --> 3663.98]  of all our
[3663.98 --> 3664.50]  being and
[3664.50 --> 3665.10]  understanding
[3665.10 --> 3665.44]  yet.
[3666.24 --> 3666.90]  This person
[3666.90 --> 3667.52]  hasn't come
[3667.52 --> 3668.70]  to a full
[3668.70 --> 3669.14]  orbed
[3669.14 --> 3669.92]  understanding
[3669.92 --> 3671.14]  that since
[3671.14 --> 3671.86]  justification
[3671.86 --> 3673.12]  is by grace
[3673.12 --> 3673.44]  alone,
[3673.52 --> 3674.02]  through faith
[3674.02 --> 3674.36]  alone,
[3674.42 --> 3674.92]  in Christ
[3674.92 --> 3675.32]  alone,
[3675.70 --> 3676.20]  the use
[3676.20 --> 3676.74]  of meat
[3676.74 --> 3677.60]  or wine
[3677.60 --> 3678.54]  or of this
[3678.54 --> 3679.00]  festival
[3679.00 --> 3679.64]  or that
[3679.64 --> 3680.18]  festival
[3680.18 --> 3681.02]  becomes
[3681.02 --> 3681.48]  irrelevant.
[3683.18 --> 3683.82]  Since you're
[3683.82 --> 3685.06]  saved by
[3685.06 --> 3685.92]  grace alone,
[3686.18 --> 3686.68]  there's no
[3686.68 --> 3687.14]  need to
[3687.14 --> 3687.96]  feel that
[3687.96 --> 3689.52]  somehow you
[3689.52 --> 3689.88]  have to
[3689.88 --> 3690.70]  keep God's
[3690.70 --> 3691.08]  favor,
[3691.36 --> 3691.68]  you have to
[3691.68 --> 3692.36]  keep God's
[3692.36 --> 3693.02]  salvation by
[3693.02 --> 3693.90]  following these
[3693.90 --> 3694.78]  rules or
[3694.78 --> 3695.54]  these regulations.
[3697.98 --> 3698.20]  Now,
[3698.64 --> 3700.04]  before I go
[3700.04 --> 3700.40]  too much
[3700.40 --> 3700.78]  further,
[3702.08 --> 3702.46]  and in
[3702.46 --> 3703.10]  honor of
[3703.10 --> 3704.34]  that little
[3704.34 --> 3704.96]  old lady
[3704.96 --> 3705.84]  in the
[3705.84 --> 3706.12]  neighborhood
[3706.12 --> 3706.74]  outside of
[3706.74 --> 3707.54]  Grand Rapids,
[3707.54 --> 3708.82]  it's important
[3708.82 --> 3709.38]  to note
[3709.38 --> 3712.46]  that these
[3712.46 --> 3713.52]  kinds of
[3713.52 --> 3714.56]  rules and
[3714.56 --> 3715.38]  regulations
[3715.38 --> 3717.70]  are held
[3717.70 --> 3718.64]  by people
[3718.64 --> 3719.64]  as an
[3719.64 --> 3720.28]  expression
[3720.28 --> 3721.20]  of their
[3721.20 --> 3722.50]  faith to
[3722.50 --> 3723.90]  ensure that
[3723.90 --> 3724.70]  they remain
[3724.70 --> 3725.34]  faithful.
[3726.78 --> 3726.86]  Right?
[3726.92 --> 3727.32]  And so this
[3727.32 --> 3728.10]  isn't about,
[3728.20 --> 3728.70]  like we said,
[3728.96 --> 3729.66]  a lack of
[3729.66 --> 3730.30]  trust or a
[3730.30 --> 3730.90]  feeble faith.
[3730.98 --> 3731.64]  They're trying
[3731.64 --> 3732.34]  to be
[3732.34 --> 3733.64]  obedient and
[3733.64 --> 3734.28]  to ensure
[3734.28 --> 3735.40]  their obedience.
[3735.72 --> 3736.90]  They're raising
[3736.90 --> 3737.54]  the fences
[3737.54 --> 3738.22]  a little bit
[3738.22 --> 3738.78]  higher,
[3739.18 --> 3739.74]  they're moving
[3739.74 --> 3740.36]  the boundaries
[3740.36 --> 3740.98]  a little bit
[3740.98 --> 3741.52]  closer,
[3741.94 --> 3743.06]  further away
[3743.06 --> 3743.56]  from the
[3743.56 --> 3744.12]  edge of
[3744.12 --> 3744.74]  what becomes
[3744.74 --> 3746.02]  not permissible
[3746.02 --> 3746.56]  for us,
[3746.64 --> 3747.62]  in order to
[3747.62 --> 3748.22]  ensure that
[3748.22 --> 3748.46]  they don't
[3748.46 --> 3749.06]  fall off.
[3750.06 --> 3750.28]  Right?
[3750.30 --> 3750.70]  In order to
[3750.70 --> 3751.08]  ensure that
[3751.08 --> 3751.40]  they don't
[3751.40 --> 3752.00]  transgress.
[3755.20 --> 3756.10]  An illustration,
[3756.24 --> 3756.86]  a personal one
[3756.86 --> 3757.92]  from my own
[3757.92 --> 3758.18]  life.
[3758.76 --> 3759.22]  Some of you
[3759.22 --> 3760.00]  know my story
[3760.00 --> 3761.06]  and parts of it
[3761.06 --> 3762.18]  more detailed
[3762.18 --> 3762.62]  than others,
[3762.74 --> 3764.02]  but there was
[3764.02 --> 3764.68]  a period in my
[3764.68 --> 3767.04]  life where I
[3767.04 --> 3767.60]  did a lot
[3767.60 --> 3768.94]  of what we'll
[3768.94 --> 3770.20]  call recreational
[3770.20 --> 3770.96]  drug use.
[3772.14 --> 3772.82]  And when the
[3772.82 --> 3773.28]  Lord got a
[3773.28 --> 3773.84]  hold of me
[3773.84 --> 3774.30]  and started
[3774.30 --> 3775.10]  changing my
[3775.10 --> 3777.66]  life, I had
[3777.66 --> 3778.26]  to stop
[3778.26 --> 3779.00]  hanging out
[3779.00 --> 3779.46]  with certain
[3779.46 --> 3779.88]  people.
[3781.60 --> 3782.58]  I had to
[3782.58 --> 3783.34]  build big
[3783.34 --> 3785.34]  fences around
[3785.34 --> 3786.62]  my life in
[3786.62 --> 3787.42]  order to stop
[3787.42 --> 3788.00]  that kind of
[3788.00 --> 3788.62]  activity from
[3788.62 --> 3789.18]  happening, in
[3789.18 --> 3789.64]  order to get
[3789.64 --> 3790.68]  that temptation
[3790.68 --> 3791.42]  away.
[3791.48 --> 3791.78]  I had to
[3791.78 --> 3792.38]  change my
[3792.38 --> 3793.10]  friend group
[3793.10 --> 3794.28]  because it
[3794.28 --> 3795.38]  was too
[3795.38 --> 3796.26]  easy, if I
[3796.26 --> 3796.64]  was hanging
[3796.64 --> 3797.00]  out with
[3797.00 --> 3797.66]  them, to
[3797.66 --> 3798.08]  give in.
[3799.18 --> 3799.70]  And for a
[3799.70 --> 3800.18]  really long
[3800.18 --> 3801.52]  time, I
[3801.52 --> 3801.90]  couldn't be
[3801.90 --> 3802.88]  around people
[3802.88 --> 3804.72]  who were, for
[3804.72 --> 3805.86]  instance, smoking
[3805.86 --> 3806.82]  marijuana because
[3806.82 --> 3808.42]  I would smell
[3808.42 --> 3809.22]  it and go, oh
[3809.22 --> 3809.68]  yeah, I could
[3809.68 --> 3810.40]  probably do it.
[3811.14 --> 3811.58]  It would be
[3811.58 --> 3811.88]  okay.
[3812.92 --> 3813.42]  And so I had
[3813.42 --> 3813.98]  to create these
[3813.98 --> 3814.70]  fences, I had
[3814.70 --> 3815.18]  to create these
[3815.18 --> 3815.52]  walls.
[3815.86 --> 3816.82]  In my fervor,
[3817.16 --> 3817.72]  though, what
[3817.72 --> 3818.82]  happened is I
[3818.82 --> 3819.76]  began prescribing
[3819.76 --> 3820.76]  the same approach
[3820.76 --> 3821.64]  for everyone
[3821.64 --> 3822.06]  else.
[3823.10 --> 3824.40]  I began to
[3824.40 --> 3825.02]  say things like,
[3825.10 --> 3825.66]  well, nobody
[3825.66 --> 3826.28]  can hang out
[3826.28 --> 3826.62]  with those
[3826.62 --> 3827.26]  people because
[3827.26 --> 3828.20]  everybody's going
[3828.20 --> 3828.72]  to fall into
[3828.72 --> 3829.24]  that sin.
[3830.54 --> 3831.26]  You see the
[3831.26 --> 3831.66]  shift that
[3831.66 --> 3832.24]  happens there?
[3833.26 --> 3833.44]  Right?
[3833.60 --> 3834.22]  What is good
[3834.22 --> 3834.98]  for me and
[3834.98 --> 3835.86]  wise for me
[3835.86 --> 3836.70]  became a
[3836.70 --> 3838.08]  prescription for
[3838.08 --> 3838.50]  everyone.
[3839.76 --> 3840.50]  And it's not
[3840.50 --> 3840.96]  that I didn't
[3840.96 --> 3841.68]  trust God for
[3841.68 --> 3842.36]  my salvation,
[3843.08 --> 3843.30]  right?
[3843.30 --> 3843.66]  It's that I
[3843.66 --> 3844.46]  was learning to
[3844.46 --> 3845.08]  trust him for
[3845.08 --> 3845.72]  my obedience.
[3847.22 --> 3847.90]  And that's
[3847.90 --> 3848.54]  what's going on
[3848.54 --> 3848.68]  here.
[3848.74 --> 3849.38]  That's why people
[3849.38 --> 3849.96]  create these
[3849.96 --> 3851.08]  fences and build
[3851.08 --> 3851.56]  these walls.
[3851.56 --> 3852.32]  And to the
[3852.32 --> 3853.24]  church at Rome,
[3853.30 --> 3854.12]  Paul says,
[3854.56 --> 3855.50]  except the one
[3855.50 --> 3856.38]  whose faith is
[3856.38 --> 3856.96]  weak, that is
[3856.96 --> 3857.58]  the one who is
[3857.58 --> 3859.08]  learning how to
[3859.08 --> 3860.80]  fully embrace
[3860.80 --> 3861.54]  their justification
[3861.54 --> 3862.72]  by grace alone,
[3862.98 --> 3864.40]  through faith alone,
[3864.48 --> 3865.32]  in Christ alone,
[3865.64 --> 3866.36]  except them
[3866.36 --> 3868.16]  without quarreling
[3868.16 --> 3870.06]  over disputable
[3870.06 --> 3870.94]  matters.
[3872.82 --> 3873.68]  Now the next
[3873.68 --> 3874.64]  question is sort
[3874.64 --> 3875.10]  of the hinge
[3875.10 --> 3875.64]  of it all.
[3875.98 --> 3876.76]  Because what are
[3876.76 --> 3877.70]  these disputable
[3877.70 --> 3878.02]  matters?
[3878.02 --> 3880.40]  What does that
[3880.40 --> 3880.64]  mean?
[3881.92 --> 3882.60]  Now the two
[3882.60 --> 3883.22]  words that are
[3883.22 --> 3883.98]  used here in
[3883.98 --> 3885.76]  Greek, the first
[3885.76 --> 3886.70]  one means judging
[3886.70 --> 3888.28]  or discerning, and
[3888.28 --> 3889.12]  the second one
[3889.12 --> 3890.70]  means thoughts
[3890.70 --> 3892.58]  or disputations.
[3893.54 --> 3894.28]  And so, for
[3894.28 --> 3895.12]  instance, if you
[3895.12 --> 3896.08]  read a different
[3896.08 --> 3897.00]  translation than
[3897.00 --> 3897.52]  the one we've
[3897.52 --> 3898.10]  read here, which
[3898.10 --> 3899.58]  is the NIV, if
[3899.58 --> 3900.16]  you read the
[3900.16 --> 3901.06]  ESV, the
[3901.06 --> 3901.78]  English Standard
[3901.78 --> 3902.48]  Version, it
[3902.48 --> 3903.22]  might say, do
[3903.22 --> 3904.30]  not quarrel over
[3904.30 --> 3905.00]  opinions.
[3905.00 --> 3906.92]  Or the New
[3906.92 --> 3907.80]  Living Translation
[3907.80 --> 3908.50]  says, do not
[3908.50 --> 3909.34]  argue with them
[3909.34 --> 3910.12]  about what they
[3910.12 --> 3910.90]  think is right
[3910.90 --> 3911.26]  or wrong.
[3912.12 --> 3912.88]  If you like
[3912.88 --> 3913.96]  older translations,
[3914.94 --> 3915.96]  the King James
[3915.96 --> 3917.52]  Version says, do
[3917.52 --> 3918.80]  not quarrel over
[3918.80 --> 3919.42]  doubtful
[3919.42 --> 3920.48]  disputations.
[3922.04 --> 3922.80]  Now to sum it
[3922.80 --> 3924.14]  up, I think
[3924.14 --> 3926.28]  Paul's point is
[3926.28 --> 3927.78]  to encourage us
[3927.78 --> 3928.92]  to not waste
[3928.92 --> 3931.02]  time arguing
[3931.02 --> 3932.08]  over things
[3932.08 --> 3933.86]  about which there
[3933.86 --> 3935.48]  can be reasonable
[3935.48 --> 3936.48]  differences of
[3936.48 --> 3936.86]  opinion.
[3937.84 --> 3938.66]  Now I'm beginning
[3938.66 --> 3939.40]  to expand that
[3939.40 --> 3940.50]  definition for us,
[3941.78 --> 3943.40]  but I also think
[3943.40 --> 3944.40]  that as you read
[3944.40 --> 3945.16]  the rest of the
[3945.16 --> 3945.98]  text, especially
[3945.98 --> 3946.70]  as we get into
[3946.70 --> 3947.92]  the second part
[3947.92 --> 3948.50]  of the argument
[3948.50 --> 3949.10]  and in chapter
[3949.10 --> 3950.58]  15, where he
[3950.58 --> 3951.86]  finally uses the
[3951.86 --> 3952.94]  word strong, so
[3952.94 --> 3953.82]  he's contrasting
[3953.82 --> 3954.44]  those who are
[3954.44 --> 3955.02]  weak, who are
[3955.02 --> 3955.84]  yet to understand
[3955.84 --> 3956.82]  the full scope,
[3956.90 --> 3957.48]  and those who
[3957.48 --> 3959.24]  are strong, that
[3959.24 --> 3960.50]  there is a call
[3960.50 --> 3961.58]  for movement,
[3961.84 --> 3962.54]  there is a call
[3962.54 --> 3964.32]  for maturing in
[3964.32 --> 3965.64]  faith, right?
[3965.68 --> 3966.36]  And that maturing
[3966.36 --> 3967.06]  comes from
[3967.06 --> 3968.26]  understanding and
[3968.26 --> 3969.44]  applying the scope
[3969.44 --> 3970.46]  of the gospel.
[3971.28 --> 3972.56]  And so the truth
[3972.56 --> 3973.70]  behind and through
[3973.70 --> 3975.02]  this is that the
[3975.02 --> 3976.48]  so-called weaker
[3976.48 --> 3977.54]  brother or sister
[3977.54 --> 3978.58]  should want to
[3978.58 --> 3980.16]  become the stronger
[3980.16 --> 3981.72]  brother or sister
[3981.72 --> 3982.50]  in the faith.
[3982.70 --> 3983.88]  The problem is,
[3984.38 --> 3985.08]  who's going to be
[3985.08 --> 3985.96]  the first person to
[3985.96 --> 3986.68]  raise their hand
[3986.68 --> 3987.30]  and say, you know
[3987.30 --> 3987.92]  what, in this
[3987.92 --> 3989.34]  arrangement, I'm the
[3989.34 --> 3989.94]  weaker one.
[3992.16 --> 3993.26]  Very few of us
[3993.26 --> 3993.92]  are self-aware
[3993.92 --> 3994.82]  enough to realize
[3994.82 --> 3996.46]  that we are the
[3996.46 --> 3997.56]  weaker ones in the
[3997.56 --> 3998.40]  relationships of
[3998.40 --> 3999.96]  faith and maturation,
[4000.78 --> 4000.92]  right?
[4000.98 --> 4002.68]  Because, especially
[4002.68 --> 4003.76]  because the kind
[4003.76 --> 4005.20]  of weakness that
[4005.20 --> 4006.22]  Paul is talking
[4006.22 --> 4008.28]  about here comes
[4008.28 --> 4009.40]  often with a lot
[4009.40 --> 4010.16]  of fervor,
[4011.62 --> 4011.86]  right?
[4012.00 --> 4013.50]  Not unlike the
[4013.50 --> 4014.88]  Pharisees of Jesus'
[4015.12 --> 4016.88]  day, those people
[4016.88 --> 4017.94]  with the sort of
[4017.94 --> 4020.40]  legalistic rule-following
[4020.40 --> 4022.58]  impulses have a
[4022.58 --> 4024.22]  tendency in systems
[4024.22 --> 4025.24]  not unlike our
[4025.24 --> 4026.78]  own to emerge as
[4026.78 --> 4028.66]  leaders, right?
[4028.68 --> 4029.24]  Or to be able to
[4029.24 --> 4031.46]  exercise influence.
[4032.80 --> 4033.88]  And sometimes that's
[4033.88 --> 4035.16]  because they are
[4035.16 --> 4035.62]  loud.
[4036.40 --> 4037.48]  Other times it's
[4037.48 --> 4038.58]  because we interpret
[4038.58 --> 4040.98]  their passion as a
[4040.98 --> 4041.76]  commitment and a
[4041.76 --> 4042.68]  pursuit of holiness
[4042.68 --> 4043.40]  and we say, yeah,
[4043.44 --> 4044.10]  we want to be like
[4044.10 --> 4044.40]  that.
[4045.02 --> 4045.98]  Because passion
[4045.98 --> 4047.66]  conveys truth
[4047.66 --> 4048.60]  for some of us.
[4051.06 --> 4052.26]  Now, I think then
[4052.26 --> 4053.70]  it's helpful
[4053.70 --> 4055.42]  as we are asking
[4055.42 --> 4056.34]  these questions
[4056.34 --> 4057.62]  to look at the
[4057.62 --> 4058.86]  kinds of things
[4058.86 --> 4060.62]  that Paul identifies
[4060.62 --> 4062.00]  as disputable
[4062.00 --> 4063.40]  matters and then
[4063.40 --> 4064.12]  to see
[4064.12 --> 4066.06]  on which side
[4066.06 --> 4067.06]  of these issues
[4067.06 --> 4068.22]  the weak and
[4068.22 --> 4069.22]  strong Christian
[4069.22 --> 4070.00]  might fall
[4070.00 --> 4070.98]  and then
[4070.98 --> 4072.00]  we can ask,
[4072.40 --> 4072.88]  where do I
[4072.88 --> 4073.36]  stand?
[4074.06 --> 4074.64]  Or where do we
[4074.64 --> 4074.96]  stand?
[4074.96 --> 4077.96]  Now, in
[4077.96 --> 4078.60]  preparing for
[4078.60 --> 4080.42]  this, I was
[4080.42 --> 4081.64]  able to
[4081.64 --> 4082.98]  identify
[4082.98 --> 4084.64]  what I will
[4084.64 --> 4085.36]  call six
[4085.36 --> 4086.62]  clear examples.
[4087.48 --> 4088.16]  There are a
[4088.16 --> 4088.84]  couple other
[4088.84 --> 4089.82]  examples that
[4089.82 --> 4090.36]  may be less
[4090.36 --> 4092.36]  clear, but
[4092.36 --> 4092.76]  we're not going
[4092.76 --> 4093.70]  to bother
[4093.70 --> 4094.40]  ourselves with
[4094.40 --> 4095.68]  those for this
[4095.68 --> 4096.08]  point, although
[4096.08 --> 4096.76]  I suspect we'll
[4096.76 --> 4097.30]  talk about them
[4097.30 --> 4097.82]  in the podcast
[4097.82 --> 4099.00]  on Tuesday, and
[4099.00 --> 4099.64]  so there's a
[4099.64 --> 4100.22]  plug if you want
[4100.22 --> 4100.58]  to see what
[4100.58 --> 4101.20]  those ones are.
[4102.64 --> 4103.54]  Six examples
[4103.54 --> 4104.28]  of these
[4104.28 --> 4105.00]  disputable
[4105.00 --> 4106.22]  matters in
[4106.22 --> 4106.46]  the New
[4106.46 --> 4106.82]  Testament.
[4107.36 --> 4108.16]  Three are
[4108.16 --> 4108.70]  from our
[4108.70 --> 4109.58]  text, and
[4109.58 --> 4109.98]  three are
[4109.98 --> 4110.38]  from other
[4110.38 --> 4110.80]  texts.
[4111.56 --> 4112.08]  The first
[4112.08 --> 4112.88]  one is
[4112.88 --> 4113.38]  verse 2,
[4113.90 --> 4114.08]  right?
[4114.52 --> 4115.54]  One person's
[4115.54 --> 4116.40]  faith allows
[4116.40 --> 4117.00]  them to eat
[4117.00 --> 4118.32]  anything, but
[4118.32 --> 4119.10]  another, whose
[4119.10 --> 4119.78]  faith is weak,
[4120.20 --> 4120.78]  eats only
[4120.78 --> 4121.32]  vegetables.
[4123.04 --> 4123.66]  And so here
[4123.66 --> 4124.58]  you can see
[4124.58 --> 4125.20]  that there's a
[4125.20 --> 4126.44]  connection back
[4126.44 --> 4127.34]  to the Jewish
[4127.34 --> 4128.58]  dietary laws
[4128.58 --> 4129.96]  and restrictions
[4129.96 --> 4131.26]  which forbade
[4131.26 --> 4132.06]  the eating of
[4132.06 --> 4132.74]  certain kinds
[4132.74 --> 4133.32]  of foods.
[4134.34 --> 4135.36]  Now this is a
[4135.36 --> 4136.56]  disputable matter
[4136.56 --> 4138.08]  because in
[4138.08 --> 4140.00]  Mark 7, Jesus
[4140.00 --> 4142.00]  says, don't
[4142.00 --> 4142.72]  you see that
[4142.72 --> 4143.26]  nothing that
[4143.26 --> 4144.08]  enters a person
[4144.08 --> 4144.90]  from outside
[4144.90 --> 4145.72]  can defile
[4145.72 --> 4146.00]  them?
[4146.48 --> 4147.06]  For it doesn't
[4147.06 --> 4147.66]  go into their
[4147.66 --> 4148.68]  heart, but into
[4148.68 --> 4149.82]  their stomach, and
[4149.82 --> 4150.30]  then out of the
[4150.30 --> 4150.58]  body.
[4150.66 --> 4151.16]  And then Mark
[4151.16 --> 4151.80]  adds this
[4151.80 --> 4152.46]  comment, which
[4152.46 --> 4153.18]  is why it's in
[4153.18 --> 4154.58]  parentheses there.
[4154.66 --> 4155.14]  He says, in
[4155.14 --> 4156.52]  saying this, Jesus
[4156.52 --> 4158.22]  declared all foods
[4158.22 --> 4158.88]  clean.
[4158.88 --> 4161.40]  And then again,
[4161.52 --> 4163.04]  in Acts 10, verse
[4163.04 --> 4164.04]  9 and following,
[4164.56 --> 4165.46]  you read the
[4165.46 --> 4166.26]  story of Peter
[4166.26 --> 4167.00]  who has a
[4167.00 --> 4168.06]  vision, and in
[4168.06 --> 4169.46]  his vision, a
[4169.46 --> 4170.58]  blanket descends
[4170.58 --> 4171.64]  from heaven, and
[4171.64 --> 4172.42]  on it are all
[4172.42 --> 4173.42]  kinds of animals,
[4173.64 --> 4174.24]  four-hooved
[4174.24 --> 4175.70]  animals, split-hooved
[4175.70 --> 4177.50]  animals, reptiles
[4177.50 --> 4178.96]  and birds, and
[4178.96 --> 4180.12]  God tells Peter, the
[4180.12 --> 4180.72]  voice from heaven
[4180.72 --> 4181.84]  tells Peter, eat.
[4182.46 --> 4183.54]  And Peter says,
[4183.96 --> 4184.52]  remembering his
[4184.52 --> 4185.30]  upbringing as a
[4185.30 --> 4186.32]  good Jew, I've
[4186.32 --> 4187.58]  never eaten unclean
[4187.58 --> 4188.06]  foods.
[4188.88 --> 4189.66]  I've never had
[4189.66 --> 4190.78]  anything impure.
[4191.50 --> 4192.06]  And then the
[4192.06 --> 4192.80]  voice says to
[4192.80 --> 4193.52]  Peter in Acts
[4193.52 --> 4195.14]  10, 15, do not
[4195.14 --> 4195.98]  call anything
[4195.98 --> 4197.42]  impure what God
[4197.42 --> 4198.84]  has made clean.
[4201.20 --> 4203.10]  And so, in
[4203.10 --> 4204.56]  verse 14 of our
[4204.56 --> 4205.58]  text, in Romans
[4205.58 --> 4206.90]  14, so again, if
[4206.90 --> 4207.20]  you have your
[4207.20 --> 4208.78]  Bible, Paul then
[4208.78 --> 4209.80]  takes this and
[4209.80 --> 4210.48]  says, I am
[4210.48 --> 4211.50]  convinced, being
[4211.50 --> 4212.72]  fully persuaded in
[4212.72 --> 4213.78]  the Lord Jesus, that
[4213.78 --> 4215.76]  nothing is unclean
[4215.76 --> 4217.72]  in itself.
[4218.88 --> 4220.40]  But then he goes
[4220.40 --> 4222.72]  on to say, but if
[4222.72 --> 4223.88]  anyone regards
[4223.88 --> 4224.78]  something as
[4224.78 --> 4226.92]  unclean, then for
[4226.92 --> 4229.20]  that person, it is
[4229.20 --> 4229.86]  unclean.
[4231.16 --> 4232.46]  That's why this is a
[4232.46 --> 4233.30]  disputable matter.
[4235.00 --> 4235.66]  Right?
[4235.74 --> 4236.58]  The second example
[4236.58 --> 4237.42]  coming from the
[4237.42 --> 4239.32]  text is of one day
[4239.32 --> 4240.36]  being more sacred
[4240.36 --> 4241.70]  than another, or
[4241.70 --> 4243.22]  every day being
[4243.22 --> 4243.62]  alike.
[4243.72 --> 4244.24]  This is verse
[4244.24 --> 4244.60]  five.
[4244.60 --> 4246.34]  And here again,
[4246.64 --> 4247.50]  right, is a tie
[4247.50 --> 4248.60]  back to the Jewish
[4248.60 --> 4249.78]  instructions around
[4249.78 --> 4251.32]  Sabbath and around
[4251.32 --> 4252.64]  holy day festivals.
[4253.82 --> 4254.80]  Instructions that
[4254.80 --> 4256.16]  the people in the
[4256.16 --> 4257.30]  law are required
[4257.30 --> 4257.94]  to keep.
[4259.28 --> 4259.54]  Right?
[4260.02 --> 4261.00]  Remember the
[4261.00 --> 4262.06]  Sabbath day and
[4262.06 --> 4263.08]  keep it holy.
[4265.08 --> 4266.10]  On it you shall
[4266.10 --> 4267.22]  not do any work,
[4267.92 --> 4268.66]  neither your son
[4268.66 --> 4269.46]  nor daughter, your
[4269.46 --> 4270.18]  manservant nor
[4270.18 --> 4271.50]  maidservant, neither
[4271.50 --> 4273.02]  the alien within your
[4273.02 --> 4273.88]  gates or any of your
[4273.88 --> 4274.32]  animals.
[4276.46 --> 4278.04]  But again, in
[4278.04 --> 4279.50]  Mark 2, Jesus
[4279.50 --> 4280.76]  says, the
[4280.76 --> 4281.80]  Sabbath was made
[4281.80 --> 4282.90]  for man, not
[4282.90 --> 4283.58]  man for the
[4283.58 --> 4283.84]  Sabbath.
[4284.20 --> 4285.12]  So the son of
[4285.12 --> 4286.58]  man is Lord even
[4286.58 --> 4287.60]  of the Sabbath.
[4288.96 --> 4289.52]  And then Paul
[4289.52 --> 4290.20]  writes in
[4290.20 --> 4291.46]  Colossians 2,
[4292.18 --> 4293.08]  it says, therefore,
[4293.30 --> 4294.40]  do not let anyone
[4294.40 --> 4295.40]  judge you by what
[4295.40 --> 4296.48]  you eat or drink or
[4296.48 --> 4297.36]  with regard to a
[4297.36 --> 4298.80]  religious festival, a
[4298.80 --> 4299.88]  new moon celebration,
[4299.88 --> 4301.28]  or a Sabbath day.
[4301.76 --> 4302.80]  These are shadows
[4302.80 --> 4303.66]  of the things that
[4303.66 --> 4304.30]  were to come.
[4304.42 --> 4305.12]  The reality,
[4305.40 --> 4306.76]  however, is found
[4306.76 --> 4308.14]  in Christ.
[4311.02 --> 4311.40]  Right?
[4311.44 --> 4312.72]  In Hebrews 4, you
[4312.72 --> 4314.00]  can read how Jesus
[4314.00 --> 4315.38]  is the eternal
[4315.38 --> 4316.66]  Sabbath rest that we
[4316.66 --> 4317.82]  are to enter into.
[4318.38 --> 4319.24]  And so everything
[4319.24 --> 4320.82]  that was the Old
[4320.82 --> 4321.70]  Testament Sabbath
[4321.70 --> 4323.14]  laws pointed to is
[4323.14 --> 4324.24]  fulfilled in Jesus
[4324.24 --> 4325.94]  and applies every day,
[4326.10 --> 4327.26]  not just one day a
[4327.26 --> 4327.48]  week.
[4329.42 --> 4330.92]  Now, don't hear what
[4330.92 --> 4331.52]  I'm not saying.
[4331.52 --> 4332.04]  Right?
[4332.04 --> 4332.12]  Right?
[4332.38 --> 4333.76]  This does mean
[4333.76 --> 4334.70]  Christians shouldn't
[4334.70 --> 4335.92]  gather together on the
[4335.92 --> 4336.96]  day dedicated to the
[4336.96 --> 4339.24]  Lord, but it does beg
[4339.24 --> 4340.50]  the question about the
[4340.50 --> 4341.50]  rules and the boundaries
[4341.50 --> 4342.38]  we put around it.
[4344.38 --> 4346.00]  Now, the next example
[4346.00 --> 4349.40]  is from chapter 14,
[4349.50 --> 4350.28]  and it's found in verse
[4350.28 --> 4352.70]  21, where Paul includes
[4352.70 --> 4354.34]  drinking wine alongside
[4354.34 --> 4356.20]  of the argument against
[4356.20 --> 4356.84]  eating meat.
[4356.84 --> 4359.94]  And so it seems that
[4359.94 --> 4361.96]  this, too, was a
[4361.96 --> 4363.34]  disputed matter in the
[4363.34 --> 4365.20]  Church of Rome, that
[4365.20 --> 4366.26]  people put a prescription
[4366.26 --> 4367.54]  on drinking wine.
[4368.68 --> 4369.70]  Now, again, this might
[4369.70 --> 4371.52]  be an indication of
[4371.52 --> 4372.16]  what I talked about
[4372.16 --> 4373.46]  earlier about higher
[4373.46 --> 4375.00]  fences or moving the
[4375.00 --> 4376.38]  boundaries closer in
[4376.38 --> 4377.54]  order to protect people
[4377.54 --> 4378.82]  from the sin of
[4378.82 --> 4379.52]  drunkenness.
[4380.18 --> 4380.72]  Right?
[4380.74 --> 4381.92]  It's not that wine is
[4381.92 --> 4383.24]  bad in and of itself,
[4383.80 --> 4385.54]  but there is bad wine.
[4385.60 --> 4386.20]  Am I right, Paul?
[4386.84 --> 4389.70]  But if you are
[4389.70 --> 4391.12]  untempered in your
[4391.12 --> 4393.82]  consumption of wine,
[4393.88 --> 4394.52]  then you need higher
[4394.52 --> 4396.26]  boundaries to protect
[4396.26 --> 4397.22]  yourself from the sin
[4397.22 --> 4398.60]  that might come about.
[4400.24 --> 4401.16]  Now, there are other
[4401.16 --> 4402.14]  examples in the New
[4402.14 --> 4403.36]  Testament of these kinds
[4403.36 --> 4404.84]  of disputable matters,
[4404.90 --> 4405.72]  and I'll quickly point
[4405.72 --> 4406.50]  them out to you because
[4406.50 --> 4407.86]  it's pertinent to see
[4407.86 --> 4409.10]  the contrast through.
[4409.86 --> 4413.46]  In Galatians 2, 3 and 5,
[4413.94 --> 4415.80]  Paul talks about refusing
[4415.80 --> 4418.82]  to circumcise Titus because
[4418.82 --> 4420.74]  Titus is a Greek who
[4420.74 --> 4422.84]  became a Christian, and
[4422.84 --> 4423.86]  therefore the rules of
[4423.86 --> 4425.90]  circumcision don't apply to
[4425.90 --> 4426.12]  him.
[4426.46 --> 4429.98]  And yet, in Acts 16, verse 3,
[4430.38 --> 4431.56]  you read that Paul
[4431.56 --> 4434.96]  circumcised Timothy because
[4434.96 --> 4437.28]  Timothy was raised Jewish,
[4438.06 --> 4439.30]  as his mother was Jewish,
[4439.42 --> 4440.32]  his grandmother was Jewish,
[4440.32 --> 4441.82]  and his father was a Greek,
[4441.82 --> 4443.40]  and because Timothy would
[4443.40 --> 4445.06]  be with Paul a missionary
[4445.06 --> 4446.60]  to Jewish people.
[4448.38 --> 4449.06]  Right?
[4449.12 --> 4450.88]  This isn't a lesson about
[4450.88 --> 4451.52]  contradiction.
[4452.12 --> 4453.88]  This is a lesson about the
[4453.88 --> 4456.42]  missional context being
[4456.42 --> 4458.32]  important for discerning what
[4458.32 --> 4460.18]  is a disputable matter.
[4461.34 --> 4463.50]  Another example is food
[4463.50 --> 4464.90]  sacrificed to idols.
[4465.90 --> 4467.42]  So in Acts 15, you have the
[4467.42 --> 4468.28]  story of the Jerusalem
[4468.28 --> 4469.40]  council meeting, that is,
[4469.46 --> 4470.80]  early Christians, many of them
[4470.80 --> 4472.78]  Jewish meeting to decide how
[4472.78 --> 4474.88]  are we going to incorporate
[4474.88 --> 4476.80]  these non-Jewish people into
[4476.80 --> 4478.40]  what is becoming the
[4478.40 --> 4479.58]  Christian church.
[4480.46 --> 4481.88]  And they write a letter
[4481.88 --> 4484.42]  saying that you don't have to
[4484.42 --> 4486.20]  be circumcised, but you should
[4486.20 --> 4487.82]  avoid eating food sacrificed
[4488.66 --> 4489.88]  to idols, eating meat
[4489.88 --> 4491.46]  sacrificed to idols.
[4491.68 --> 4494.10]  But then, in 1 Corinthians 8,
[4494.30 --> 4496.04]  Paul says that that is in fact
[4496.04 --> 4498.04]  no thing, that is, the idol
[4498.04 --> 4499.38]  isn't real, so it doesn't
[4499.38 --> 4501.00]  matter if you eat this meat
[4501.00 --> 4501.56]  or not.
[4502.02 --> 4502.12]  Right?
[4502.16 --> 4504.18]  He says, food does not bring
[4504.18 --> 4506.24]  us near to God, for we are
[4506.24 --> 4507.62]  no worse if we do not eat,
[4507.70 --> 4508.72]  and no better if we do.
[4510.28 --> 4510.48]  Right?
[4510.88 --> 4512.56]  But then Paul goes on to say
[4512.56 --> 4513.68]  that we shouldn't put a
[4513.68 --> 4515.30]  stumbling block in front of
[4515.30 --> 4515.80]  other people.
[4516.04 --> 4516.24]  Right?
[4516.26 --> 4518.14]  He says that if what I eat
[4518.14 --> 4519.46]  causes my brother or sister
[4519.46 --> 4521.58]  to fall into sin, I will
[4521.58 --> 4523.30]  never eat meat again, so as to
[4523.30 --> 4525.10]  not cause them to fall.
[4527.02 --> 4528.96]  You can see, right, Paul is
[4528.96 --> 4530.72]  effectively making the same
[4530.72 --> 4532.98]  case over again.
[4533.90 --> 4535.06]  And then the last example,
[4535.88 --> 4537.20]  at least the explicit one to
[4537.20 --> 4538.62]  be found, is that of marriage
[4538.62 --> 4540.06]  and celibacy.
[4541.00 --> 4543.28]  In the same chapter, 1 Corinthians
[4543.28 --> 4546.12]  7, Paul says that celibacy is
[4546.12 --> 4547.92]  good, and in some cases it is to
[4547.92 --> 4549.18]  be preferred for all people.
[4549.94 --> 4551.82]  And Paul says that marriage is
[4551.82 --> 4553.18]  good, and in some cases it is
[4553.18 --> 4554.54]  to be preferred for all
[4554.54 --> 4554.84]  people.
[4555.94 --> 4558.30]  It's a matter of discernment and
[4558.30 --> 4561.14]  of context, of limiting sin.
[4561.28 --> 4562.78]  Point is, it's a disputable
[4562.78 --> 4564.22]  matter, and you can have
[4564.22 --> 4565.64]  differences of opinion about
[4565.64 --> 4568.08]  these things, and to chapter
[4568.08 --> 4569.94]  14's point, having those
[4569.94 --> 4571.98]  differences of opinions may not
[4571.98 --> 4573.52]  be worth fighting about.
[4574.04 --> 4575.12]  That is, they may not be worth
[4575.12 --> 4577.24]  splitting a church over, or
[4577.24 --> 4579.32]  breaking a relationship over.
[4581.82 --> 4585.56]  The weak Christians in this
[4585.56 --> 4589.96]  text's language are those who,
[4590.20 --> 4591.72]  for one reason or another,
[4591.90 --> 4593.28]  sometimes perfectly legitimate
[4593.28 --> 4595.54]  reasons, other times reasons we
[4595.54 --> 4597.00]  need to challenge for their
[4597.00 --> 4598.66]  growing and maturing in faith,
[4599.18 --> 4601.42]  who promote non-essential,
[4601.98 --> 4605.02]  cultural, ceremonial cautions
[4605.02 --> 4609.10]  as being necessary for Christian
[4609.10 --> 4611.18]  maturity, and for effectiveness.
[4612.32 --> 4614.68]  It's making what could be a
[4614.68 --> 4616.20]  matter of personal preference
[4616.20 --> 4619.32]  and personal piety prescriptive
[4619.32 --> 4622.08]  for everyone when the
[4622.08 --> 4623.40]  scriptures don't do that.
[4624.90 --> 4626.04]  Let me give you an example, for
[4626.04 --> 4627.50]  an example of this.
[4628.24 --> 4629.62]  And this was a few generations
[4629.62 --> 4631.32]  ago, nothing like this happens in
[4631.32 --> 4633.70]  our church anymore, but some
[4633.70 --> 4635.80]  people, you know, used to get very
[4635.80 --> 4638.02]  upset about contemporary music
[4638.02 --> 4639.04]  styles in church.
[4639.76 --> 4640.80]  It doesn't happen anymore.
[4643.30 --> 4645.96]  Now, these people likely would
[4645.96 --> 4648.56]  never deny that someone who wants
[4648.56 --> 4651.26]  drums in worship is a Christian,
[4651.76 --> 4654.70]  but they might say something like,
[4655.24 --> 4658.00]  that music isn't reverent.
[4659.36 --> 4660.86]  And I've heard it this way, too,
[4661.04 --> 4663.36]  that music offends the Lord.
[4663.36 --> 4666.78]  Now, what they mean, of course, is
[4666.78 --> 4669.06]  that it offends them, and then
[4669.06 --> 4670.22]  they've put themselves in the place
[4670.22 --> 4671.20]  of God, and then have made it
[4671.20 --> 4672.48]  prescriptive for everyone else.
[4673.48 --> 4675.48]  Now, if that illustration doesn't
[4675.48 --> 4677.30]  land for you, because we all love
[4677.30 --> 4679.60]  drums around here, replace drums
[4679.60 --> 4680.32]  with hip-hop.
[4682.18 --> 4684.40]  Or, gag, replace it with country
[4684.40 --> 4684.80]  music.
[4687.96 --> 4690.20]  Or replace it with a full 70-piece
[4690.20 --> 4690.70]  orchestra.
[4692.76 --> 4693.16]  Right?
[4693.24 --> 4695.04]  Point is, for any one of those,
[4695.28 --> 4697.30]  as soon as you say, that's not
[4697.30 --> 4699.42]  worship, we can't do that,
[4699.58 --> 4700.72]  you're in the realm of a
[4700.72 --> 4702.08]  disputable matter, and you're
[4702.08 --> 4703.60]  elevating personal preference and
[4703.60 --> 4705.68]  personal piety to prescription.
[4706.84 --> 4708.16]  And so it may be true that you
[4708.16 --> 4709.48]  can't worship through that,
[4710.86 --> 4711.88]  but that doesn't mean I can't.
[4714.16 --> 4716.92]  And look, it may even be true that
[4716.92 --> 4718.32]  it's not wise for you.
[4720.08 --> 4720.30]  Right?
[4720.34 --> 4722.16]  Because if, what Paul gets into
[4722.16 --> 4723.60]  here, right, is that if that
[4723.60 --> 4726.82]  pricks your conscience, if it is
[4726.82 --> 4730.14]  sinful for you, because it becomes
[4730.14 --> 4731.50]  sinful for you because you're going
[4731.50 --> 4732.90]  against your conscience.
[4733.00 --> 4734.24]  And I think this is the sum of
[4734.24 --> 4736.16]  Paul's point in verse 5, right?
[4736.18 --> 4738.28]  He says, each of them should be
[4738.28 --> 4741.12]  fully convinced in their own mind.
[4741.76 --> 4743.48]  And so if you are convinced of it,
[4743.76 --> 4744.56]  follow through.
[4744.56 --> 4747.36]  Because if you don't, you're
[4747.36 --> 4748.06]  compromising.
[4749.64 --> 4751.38]  And as people, we compromise for
[4751.38 --> 4753.06]  all sorts of reasons, right?
[4753.10 --> 4754.76]  Sometimes we compromise in order to
[4754.76 --> 4756.60]  keep the peace, but when we keep
[4756.60 --> 4757.96]  the peace, what we're doing inside
[4757.96 --> 4759.90]  is judging those other people, or
[4759.90 --> 4760.88]  we're judging ourselves.
[4762.20 --> 4762.32]  Right?
[4762.38 --> 4764.04]  Sometimes we compromise because we
[4764.04 --> 4765.24]  go, yeah, you know what, I really
[4765.24 --> 4767.64]  do actually want to do that, and
[4767.64 --> 4768.98]  that would feel good in the moment,
[4769.10 --> 4770.12]  so I'm just going to go ahead and
[4770.12 --> 4770.50]  do it.
[4770.50 --> 4773.12]  But if it pricks your conscience,
[4773.42 --> 4775.12]  then don't do it.
[4776.40 --> 4780.24]  Instead, I think that in this, there
[4780.24 --> 4782.92]  is a sort of controlling principle
[4782.92 --> 4785.36]  that speaks over top of all of it,
[4785.40 --> 4786.76]  and you can see it in verse 8.
[4788.26 --> 4791.52]  Verse 8 says, if we live, we live for
[4791.52 --> 4793.72]  the Lord, and if we die, we die for
[4793.72 --> 4794.04]  the Lord.
[4794.12 --> 4796.20]  So whether we live or die, we belong
[4796.20 --> 4798.38]  to the Lord.
[4799.80 --> 4801.30]  Now, not only is this a great
[4801.30 --> 4803.36]  comfort, that I belong to the Lord
[4803.36 --> 4805.82]  in life and in death, right?
[4805.84 --> 4808.60]  But this is also an operating
[4808.60 --> 4809.16]  principle.
[4810.00 --> 4812.42]  This is an operating purpose, right?
[4812.48 --> 4814.92]  It is the context of our mission to
[4814.92 --> 4817.70]  live for the Lord, and if it be our
[4817.70 --> 4819.00]  lot, to die for Him.
[4822.04 --> 4824.20]  Now, here's an important word for
[4824.20 --> 4827.02]  for those of us who may be on the
[4827.02 --> 4830.26]  strong side of this polarity,
[4832.04 --> 4832.30]  right?
[4832.74 --> 4836.36]  If you suspect that any of these
[4836.36 --> 4838.66]  kinds of disputable matters may be
[4838.66 --> 4842.08]  true for a brother or sister, you also
[4842.08 --> 4843.22]  cannot do it.
[4845.18 --> 4845.38]  Okay?
[4845.40 --> 4846.74]  That's what it means to live in
[4846.74 --> 4847.14]  community.
[4847.32 --> 4849.02]  That's what it means to mature in
[4849.02 --> 4849.46]  community.
[4849.46 --> 4853.48]  That you, as strong in faith, even
[4853.48 --> 4855.68]  though you fully understand Galatians
[4855.68 --> 4857.42]  5, that says, it is for freedom that
[4857.42 --> 4859.92]  Christ has set me free, you willingly
[4859.92 --> 4862.50]  give up that freedom.
[4862.86 --> 4865.00]  You willingly offer it as a living
[4865.00 --> 4867.90]  sacrifice for your brother or sister
[4867.90 --> 4869.26]  in the assembly.
[4869.46 --> 4871.52]  You give up your freedom for their
[4871.52 --> 4872.88]  faith and obedience.
[4873.10 --> 4874.64]  That's what it means to be strong.
[4875.78 --> 4878.22]  This is the gospel redefining strength
[4878.22 --> 4880.12]  in the mix right now.
[4880.88 --> 4883.18]  To give up your rights and freedoms
[4883.18 --> 4885.86]  for the faith security of a brother
[4885.86 --> 4886.64]  or sister.
[4887.86 --> 4889.58]  And like we said, Galatians 5 is still
[4889.58 --> 4889.90]  true.
[4890.04 --> 4891.54]  It is for freedom that Christ has set
[4891.54 --> 4892.72]  us free, right?
[4892.96 --> 4896.78]  The new reality of the gospel for
[4896.78 --> 4899.56]  Christians is freedom, and that freedom
[4899.56 --> 4901.94]  opens up a whole world of possibilities
[4901.94 --> 4904.36]  in life and in faithfulness, even
[4904.36 --> 4905.56]  dressing like this when you're
[4905.56 --> 4905.92]  preaching.
[4905.92 --> 4908.48]  But if it's a problem for the little
[4908.48 --> 4911.48]  old lady, then I should willingly put
[4911.48 --> 4912.12]  my tie on.
[4913.34 --> 4916.40]  As long as the reasons why it's a
[4916.40 --> 4918.40]  problem for her, we can still discuss.
[4920.44 --> 4920.88]  Right?
[4921.00 --> 4922.46]  Freedom opens us up.
[4922.56 --> 4924.74]  But later in Galatians and in this
[4924.74 --> 4926.62]  text, I think this is the point, Paul
[4926.62 --> 4928.82]  says that you, my brothers and sisters,
[4928.88 --> 4930.98]  were called to be free, but do not use
[4930.98 --> 4933.42]  your freedom to indulge the flesh.
[4933.42 --> 4936.44]  Rather, serve one another humbly in love.
[4937.28 --> 4937.62]  Right?
[4937.64 --> 4938.72]  You see, we've been working on this
[4938.72 --> 4940.74]  conversation, this through line from
[4940.74 --> 4941.26]  the beginning.
[4941.62 --> 4941.74]  Right?
[4941.84 --> 4944.02]  Part of serving one another humbly in
[4944.02 --> 4947.06]  love is giving up our freedoms for
[4947.06 --> 4947.74]  their faith.
[4949.82 --> 4952.70]  And so, for example, if you are having
[4952.70 --> 4954.70]  lunch with what I will call a moral
[4954.70 --> 4957.20]  vegan, that is someone who believes it's
[4957.20 --> 4959.64]  sinful to eat meat, you don't sit across
[4959.64 --> 4961.80]  from them and order a 12-ounce prime rib.
[4964.20 --> 4964.64]  Right?
[4964.70 --> 4966.94]  Or if you don't want hip-hop to show up
[4966.94 --> 4969.14]  in our worship, or if you do, rather,
[4969.24 --> 4970.74]  want hip-hop to show up in our worship,
[4970.98 --> 4974.24]  but you know that old Mrs. Ethel believes
[4974.24 --> 4976.14]  that we shouldn't worship in that way,
[4976.30 --> 4977.94]  then you shouldn't push that here.
[4978.80 --> 4980.66]  Even if you're a worship leader who has
[4980.66 --> 4982.32]  the power and the influence to pick that
[4982.32 --> 4982.88]  kind of thing.
[4983.20 --> 4985.60]  In fact, especially because you are a
[4985.60 --> 4986.92]  worship leader who has the power and
[4986.92 --> 4988.30]  the influence to pick that kind of thing,
[4988.30 --> 4990.04]  you shouldn't do it because you know
[4990.04 --> 4991.14]  whom you are leading.
[4992.46 --> 4995.82]  Now again, let's tread softly here,
[4996.16 --> 4998.98]  and very intentionally, because you also
[4998.98 --> 5001.88]  need to hear a person's opposition to
[5001.88 --> 5004.16]  eating meat and therefore being vegan,
[5004.38 --> 5007.04]  or your opposition to hip-hop in
[5007.04 --> 5009.38]  worship needs to be connected to what
[5009.38 --> 5011.72]  you believe to be biblical ideas and
[5011.72 --> 5014.14]  teachings for these disputed matters,
[5014.32 --> 5017.06]  if you would require us to make
[5017.06 --> 5019.26]  exceptions, or if we are going to limit
[5019.26 --> 5021.42]  our own freedoms in order to mature
[5021.42 --> 5022.02]  your faith.
[5024.06 --> 5026.40]  And that means, then, right, that your
[5026.40 --> 5028.38]  reason to tell others or to require
[5028.38 --> 5030.96]  others to be vegan must be based on
[5030.96 --> 5033.32]  what you read in the Bible, not because
[5033.32 --> 5035.32]  Ariana Grande has put a compelling tweet
[5035.32 --> 5035.58]  out.
[5036.92 --> 5039.48]  Similarly, if your opposition to hip-hop in
[5039.48 --> 5042.12]  the church is actually an outworking of
[5042.12 --> 5044.88]  racist or prejudiced ideas, we need to
[5044.88 --> 5048.28]  call you out on that, because that can't
[5048.28 --> 5048.58]  fly.
[5052.30 --> 5056.10]  We will not passively permit to
[5056.10 --> 5061.24]  continue your sin by compromising our
[5061.24 --> 5062.66]  freedoms in that regard.
[5064.66 --> 5065.94]  Now, here's the last point.
[5065.94 --> 5071.96]  Because sometimes people will hear this
[5071.96 --> 5075.46]  and they will go, oh, if I can make a
[5075.46 --> 5077.02]  compelling case for anything, then that's
[5077.02 --> 5077.78]  the way we need to go.
[5077.84 --> 5079.08]  And then they just have to give up on
[5079.08 --> 5081.26]  their deeply held values because they're
[5081.26 --> 5083.58]  called to be strong and I'll allow myself
[5083.58 --> 5085.46]  to be called weak if that means I get what
[5085.46 --> 5085.88]  I want.
[5087.82 --> 5088.04]  Right?
[5088.10 --> 5090.38]  Sometimes this idea of disputable matters
[5090.38 --> 5093.66]  has been abused in the past or taken
[5093.66 --> 5095.20]  advantage of in the past.
[5095.58 --> 5095.70]  Right?
[5095.76 --> 5097.48]  Allowing for people to have differences
[5097.48 --> 5099.42]  of opinions on things where the
[5099.42 --> 5102.34]  scriptures don't actually present a
[5102.34 --> 5103.22]  difference of opinion.
[5104.92 --> 5107.26]  And so I hope you saw very clearly when
[5107.26 --> 5109.20]  we outlined what scripture calls these
[5109.20 --> 5111.28]  disputable matters, it's because there's
[5111.28 --> 5113.58]  a history of this practice and then
[5113.58 --> 5115.32]  Jesus and a New Testament author comes
[5115.32 --> 5117.80]  along and says, we've redefined history
[5117.80 --> 5118.98]  on that practice.
[5118.98 --> 5123.58]  If the Bible doesn't redefine history on
[5123.58 --> 5126.84]  a particular practice, then the commands
[5126.84 --> 5127.58]  of God continue.
[5128.68 --> 5131.52]  What obedience looks like continues.
[5133.40 --> 5133.94]  Right?
[5134.00 --> 5136.10]  And so sometimes people will use a text
[5136.10 --> 5140.54]  like this to create a gray area to allow
[5140.54 --> 5143.60]  for what the Bible calls sin to not be
[5143.60 --> 5145.10]  treated as sin by the church.
[5145.10 --> 5147.52]  That also can't happen.
[5148.70 --> 5151.32]  That's also an abuse of this particular
[5151.32 --> 5152.38]  text.
[5153.84 --> 5156.22]  John Calvin puts it really explicitly.
[5156.46 --> 5159.64]  He says, we must not, but for the sake
[5159.64 --> 5162.78]  of our neighbors, we are not at liberty
[5162.78 --> 5165.56]  to deviate one nail's breath from the
[5165.56 --> 5169.62]  command of God that unknown pretext is
[5169.62 --> 5172.84]  lawful to attempt anything but what he
[5172.84 --> 5173.66]  permits.
[5175.72 --> 5176.28]  Right?
[5176.36 --> 5178.76]  This is not license to do whatever you
[5178.76 --> 5179.18]  want.
[5179.82 --> 5182.36]  This is license to use your freedom
[5182.36 --> 5185.58]  to grow in the grace and knowledge of
[5185.58 --> 5187.20]  our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[5187.84 --> 5190.58]  This is license to use your freedom to
[5190.58 --> 5193.08]  grow in your capacities to be obedient
[5193.08 --> 5196.56]  to him and to recognize that his ways are
[5196.56 --> 5198.24]  better than our ways.
[5198.94 --> 5201.46]  That his design and purpose is where
[5201.46 --> 5202.82]  flourishing is found.
[5204.22 --> 5206.02]  And so, yes, absolutely, there are places
[5206.02 --> 5207.92]  where we can have discussions and we can
[5207.92 --> 5208.76]  make compromises.
[5209.14 --> 5210.72]  There are places where we can say, not
[5210.72 --> 5211.74]  my will, but yours.
[5212.72 --> 5214.60]  But then there are also places where we
[5214.60 --> 5217.78]  say, no, this is clear.
[5219.78 --> 5222.78]  Living for the Lord requires us to
[5222.78 --> 5224.68]  mature in our faith.
[5224.94 --> 5227.06]  And for those of us who are more mature,
[5227.20 --> 5229.50]  to come alongside of people right where
[5229.50 --> 5233.42]  they are at and with gentleness and
[5233.42 --> 5236.26]  respect walk alongside them with
[5236.26 --> 5240.14]  humility and grace entering into life
[5240.14 --> 5243.32]  with them and calling them towards
[5243.32 --> 5243.82]  maturity.
[5245.44 --> 5249.50]  That we might grow in faith together.
[5250.24 --> 5253.82]  This is the task of discipleship, to
[5253.82 --> 5256.08]  grow in faith together.
[5256.08 --> 5260.52]  And so, have hard conversations and be
[5260.52 --> 5263.06]  willing to give up deeply held values for
[5263.06 --> 5264.16]  the sake of one another.
[5265.30 --> 5269.80]  But do not, do not overstretch the
[5269.80 --> 5272.32]  definition of disputable matters to
[5272.32 --> 5274.72]  things that the Bible will not allow you
[5274.72 --> 5274.92]  to.
[5275.62 --> 5277.72]  Because then we are just leading one
[5277.72 --> 5282.14]  another in the way, not of Jesus, but in
[5282.14 --> 5282.76]  the way of the world.
[5282.76 --> 5285.68]  And that's not our calling together.
[5286.90 --> 5291.36]  If we are able to live this and model
[5291.36 --> 5295.22]  this, we will become, and increasingly
[5295.22 --> 5299.28]  so, a community that is compelling to
[5299.28 --> 5300.32]  so many people.
[5300.78 --> 5303.00]  Because we can enter into these difficult
[5303.00 --> 5303.64]  conversations.
[5303.88 --> 5306.66]  We can enter into these disputable matters
[5306.66 --> 5311.72]  with grace and with mercy and with a
[5311.72 --> 5315.52]  sense of calm and a presence that is not
[5315.52 --> 5318.06]  anxious in and around us.
[5318.84 --> 5322.90]  Instead, we can bring Christ to bear on
[5322.90 --> 5324.58]  what we do and on how we be.
[5325.28 --> 5328.32]  And it seems to me that that is our
[5328.32 --> 5328.78]  purpose.
[5329.06 --> 5331.98]  That is the call of discipleship.
[5331.98 --> 5336.62]  To bring Christ to bear on these kinds of
[5336.62 --> 5338.10]  disputable matters.
[5338.48 --> 5338.70]  Amen?
[5338.70 --> 5340.58]  Let's pray together.
[5346.02 --> 5348.16]  Lord our God.
[5352.58 --> 5355.64]  Lord our God, it is possible that as we
[5355.64 --> 5360.64]  sit here now, our minds have moved over
[5360.64 --> 5361.24]  to judgment.
[5361.24 --> 5365.64]  It is possible that as we sit here now, we
[5365.64 --> 5369.82]  are thinking of one or another who has
[5369.82 --> 5372.42]  compromised on this or that disputable
[5372.96 --> 5376.70]  matter and we are holding them to account
[5376.70 --> 5378.66]  in manners that you do not.
[5378.66 --> 5379.66]  Lord our God.
[5379.66 --> 5380.66]  Lord our God.
[5380.66 --> 5382.98]  And so I pray that you would forgive us for that.
[5384.34 --> 5386.56]  Especially for those of us who lead.
[5387.94 --> 5390.80]  I pray that you would open us up to these kinds of
[5390.80 --> 5392.56]  relationships and realities.
[5394.70 --> 5398.12]  And God, it is also possible that we sit here now
[5398.12 --> 5400.52]  having heard only in part.
[5400.52 --> 5406.28]  And so we think, I can do whatever I want as long as I can
[5406.28 --> 5409.74]  justify it to myself and then I will justify it to you,
[5409.98 --> 5410.34]  the Lord.
[5412.40 --> 5417.66]  And yet, may we also recognize that you are calling us to
[5417.66 --> 5418.52]  obedience.
[5419.64 --> 5423.68]  That you are calling us from one degree of glory to another.
[5423.68 --> 5426.54]  Father, that you are calling us to be holy.
[5430.42 --> 5433.32]  And so send us out in the power of your holiness,
[5433.84 --> 5436.72]  the power of your spirit to be transformed.
[5438.66 --> 5440.10]  In Christ Jesus we pray.
[5440.80 --> 5441.16]  Amen.
[5453.68 --> 5463.98]  We live for you.
[5464.08 --> 5467.76]  Worthy of every song we could ever sing
[5467.76 --> 5475.18]  Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring

[5539.26 --> 5543.26]  with your heart and lead me
