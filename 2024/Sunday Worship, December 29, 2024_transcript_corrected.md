[187.18 → 191.10] along with these others on stage and a couple more we haven't yet seen
[191.10 → 197.96] this morning as we gather to worship our God we're doing so in this
[197.96 → 203.10] sort of strange like coming out of Christmas anticipating
[203.10 → 208.54] New Year's in the middle of vacations for some of us and breaks from school
[208.54 → 211.12] and the like, and so we're kind of in this
[211.12 → 214.96] middle space waiting for something and I would
[214.96 → 219.08] just want to name that as an opportunity to bring whatever that is for you
[219.08 → 219.94] into worship

[746.90 → 749.34] Where nothing is safe and certain.
[749.34 → 751.10] Except you.
[751.10 → 753.56] We ask for the courage of the Magda.
[753.56 → 756.34] Who simply went and followed a star.
[756.34 → 757.64] We ask for their wisdom.
[757.64 → 760.38] In choosing to pursue the deepest truth.
[760.38 → 762.72] Not knowing where they would be led.
[762.72 → 763.72] In the year to come.
[763.72 → 764.72] God of all time.
[764.72 → 766.96] Be our help and company.
[766.96 → 769.46] Hold our hands as we journey onward.
[769.46 → 771.58] And may your promise of Shalom.
[771.58 → 773.46] Where all will be at peace.
[773.46 → 775.46] Be our guiding star.

[1456.02 → 1458.02] Good morning, everybody.
[1458.02 → 1462.02] Can I have preschool all the way up to grade four come up to the front?
[1462.02 → 1470.02] How is everybody doing this morning?
[1470.02 → 1472.02] Good.
[1472.02 → 1474.02] Good.
[1474.02 → 1476.02] I have a few things to put out.
[1476.02 → 1478.02] Just a second.
[1478.02 → 1480.02] Oops.
[1484.02 → 1488.02] Oh, here we go.
[1488.02 → 1490.02] Perfect.
[1500.02 → 1501.02] Okay.
[1501.02 → 1505.02] So we have been learning about, of course, this is the Christmas season.
[1505.02 → 1511.02] So we have been learning about talking to Matthew about the various parts of the Christmas story.
[1511.02 → 1513.02] So we just celebrated.
[1513.02 → 1515.02] What did we just celebrate?
[1515.02 → 1517.02] The birth of Jesus Christ.
[1517.02 → 1522.02] And before that, we were doing Advent with the names of Jesus.
[1522.02 → 1532.02] Today, we are going to continue that story and talk about the wise men and children's worship time.
[1532.02 → 1534.02] And what gifts did the wise men bring?
[1534.02 → 1535.02] Yeah.
[1535.02 → 1536.02] And frankincense.
[1536.02 → 1537.02] Yeah.
[1537.02 → 1538.02] And frankincense.
[1538.02 → 1544.02] And why do you think the wise men brought these gifts to Jesus?
[1544.02 → 1547.70] Yeah, it was a form of worship him.
[1547.78 → 1549.24] So we're going to talk about worship.
[1549.80 → 1553.64] And I have a little poem that will remind us with the story.
[1554.62 → 1555.38] So do you want to come?
[1555.96 → 1556.50] Yeah, come.
[1557.86 → 1558.98] So he's going to be my helper.
[1558.98 → 1560.66] She's going to hold up the sheets.
[1561.52 → 1570.18] And first, what is this?
[1570.38 → 1571.32] What is in the picture?
[1572.06 → 1577.58] When we turn M different ways, what kind of things,
[1577.86 → 1579.72] what letters or numbers does it become?
[1581.44 → 1582.52] It becomes a W.
[1583.72 → 1584.70] It becomes a W.
[1584.78 → 1585.74] What else does it become?
[1585.74 → 1587.66] It becomes an E.
[1587.94 → 1588.38] Does anybody?
[1588.52 → 1590.28] There's one more, and it's a number.
[1591.42 → 1591.82] Levi?
[1592.54 → 1592.94] Three.
[1593.22 → 1596.28] So Zoe, in her M&Ms, I have a little M&M poem.
[1596.92 → 1598.34] So she's going to put M&Ms down.
[1598.34 → 1603.18] And then when I say the letters, you hold up the letters and show everybody in the church.
[1603.62 → 1604.24] Right there.
[1604.72 → 1607.66] So the first one, the M turns into an E.
[1609.08 → 1610.96] Yeah, so you hold it this way.
[1612.12 → 1613.82] The M turns into an E.
[1613.82 → 1617.76] The E is for east, where the stars shone oh so bright.
[1617.76 → 1619.94] Now turn to the next one.
[1621.12 → 1626.70] The next way the M turns, it's the original M.
[1627.04 → 1630.42] The M is for manger, where the baby Jesus slept that night.
[1630.42 → 1638.78] And this one is the way the M turns, is the number three.
[1639.08 → 1643.14] Three is for wise men, bearing gifts for him, they came.
[1644.02 → 1647.68] And the last one, as everybody said, it turns into a W.
[1648.68 → 1650.00] W is for worship.
[1650.30 → 1650.78] Hallelujah.
[1651.36 → 1652.38] Praise to his name.
[1652.38 → 1655.48] And so we're going to go back into children's worship time in a minute.
[1655.64 → 1660.94] We're going to talk a little bit more how worship and how it relates to the three wise men
[1660.94 → 1666.22] and how it relates to our hearts and how our whole story leads to Jesus.
[1666.72 → 1668.34] Can everybody stand up, guys?
[1668.96 → 1670.28] And we'll face the audience.
[1674.78 → 1677.06] And we're going to go one, two, three.
[1677.06 → 1679.34] The Lord is with you.
[1679.66 → 1681.14] And also with you.
[1681.14 → 1681.84] So we can see.
[1698.06 → 1699.66] I walked up here too fast.
[1699.86 → 1702.34] Now I've got to stand here awkwardly waiting for everybody to leave.
[1707.26 → 1707.70] Okay.
[1708.24 → 1709.02] I'm Joshua.
[1709.24 → 1711.10] I'm the Young Adults Ministry Coordinator here.
[1712.14 → 1714.46] Join me in the church family prayer.
[1719.36 → 1722.06] Father in heaven, holy is your name.
[1723.06 → 1729.96] I pray, Lord, that Chris, when he preaches his sermon, Lord, would be filled with your spirit
[1729.96 → 1733.14] so that his words are not his own but yours.
[1733.14 → 1741.52] And I pray, Lord, that we wouldn't hear his words, but we would hear yours and that it would transform us.
[1742.36 → 1746.34] That we would not just be hearers of the word but that we would be doers of the word.
[1746.34 → 1752.38] Lord, that it would make us more like your son so that we can act more like him and be more like him.
[1754.72 → 1756.50] I pray, Lord, for the Wagoner family.
[1756.50 → 1763.66] That as Doug is now home, Elise's father, I pray that you would help him with the partial paralysis.
[1764.88 → 1768.96] That you would help the family surround him and surround each other with love.
[1768.96 → 1774.12] I pray, Lord, that your presence would be palpable.
[1774.12 → 1779.48] That they would feel your comfort and your strength that only you can give.
[1779.48 → 1786.14] I pray, Lord, that with a future oncology consult, that that would go well and that your will, Lord, would be done.
[1786.66 → 1790.82] And that if healing is in that will, that it would be done.
[1793.48 → 1797.60] I pray also, Lord, for Tanya, who also is dealing with cancer right now.
[1798.50 → 1805.38] I pray that if she adjusts to life in the hospital, Lord, that I pray that she would also experience your peace and your comfort.
[1805.38 → 1810.14] And that she would receive healing if, again, Lord, is your will.
[1811.18 → 1814.40] And she'd be surrounded by strength and people, community, and family.
[1814.82 → 1815.82] And by this church.
[1817.40 → 1825.12] I pray, Lord, for all the college students and university students who are returning now to school shortly or already have.
[1826.46 → 1833.42] I pray that you would help them study and focus what it is that they are doing there on their various fields of study.
[1833.42 → 1840.96] And that as they live abroad, Lord, that they find their community and that they live with you and them well.
[1841.94 → 1847.32] And that they would not be pulled astray by distractions and the enemy to do anything else.
[1847.86 → 1853.90] But that you would help them do their work so that they could become more like you.
[1853.90 → 1857.96] I pray, Lord, for those who are also travelling this winter break.
[1858.68 → 1861.10] That they would travel with safety and ease.
[1862.02 → 1863.50] And that no one would be hurt.
[1864.56 → 1865.80] The roads can be icy.
[1866.62 → 1867.90] Well, not here, but...
[1870.12 → 1871.94] Yeah.
[1873.78 → 1875.94] I pray, Lord, also for the church's ministries.
[1875.94 → 1878.04] Children's worship time.
[1879.12 → 1880.12] Cadets and gems.
[1880.48 → 1881.58] Youth and young adults.
[1881.92 → 1882.66] Seniors alive.
[1882.86 → 1883.50] Coffee break.
[1883.72 → 1884.28] And the others.
[1885.10 → 1889.22] I pray, Lord, that the leaders would be filled with your spirit to lead.
[1889.68 → 1892.08] And that those who are partaking would be filled by you.
[1893.96 → 1896.22] I pray, Lord, that these ministries would be effective.
[1897.10 → 1899.96] And that you would be the one that receives the glory of their work.
[1899.96 → 1904.08] And that your church would be transformed to be more like Christ.
[1906.04 → 1907.62] I also pray, Lord, for the world.
[1908.44 → 1911.96] That with wars and nations and conflicts with...
[1913.58 → 1916.78] Lord, that you would bring peace to these places.
[1917.60 → 1921.56] And that you would work in these conflicts and in these wars as you have throughout all history.
[1922.94 → 1928.58] I pray, Lord, that as the church is found in those places, that the church would be equipped to help those people where they can.
[1930.62 → 1932.78] We can't expect heaven now.
[1934.54 → 1936.42] But we can expect your work to be done.
[1936.76 → 1937.94] The transformation of souls.
[1939.28 → 1942.12] And I pray that that would be what happens.
[1943.46 → 1951.68] And I pray, Lord, that wherever the church is found, wherever the citizens of heaven are, Lord, that we would live like we are citizens of heaven already.
[1952.46 → 1955.22] That we live like we are already in the kingdom of heaven.
[1955.22 → 1960.80] And, Lord, I pray that we would not be...
[1960.80 → 1973.80] That this church and the church of the world would not be pulled astray by the work of the devil or by any work of the world to drag us down and take our eyes off of you.
[1973.80 → 1978.10] I pray, Lord, that we would not fear anything else but just you.
[1979.20 → 1983.14] That that fear would bring love and compassion and obedience.
[1983.82 → 1987.88] And I pray, Lord, that in all of this, that we would glorify you above all.
[1988.60 → 1989.82] Because all of it is yours.
[1991.02 → 1991.28] Amen.
[2003.80 → 2004.34] Amen.
[2013.34 → 2019.88] This morning, we're going to read together from Isaiah 61.
[2019.88 → 2029.24] I'm going to read verse starting at verse 10 and through the first three verses of Isaiah 62
[2029.24 → 2036.06] but then throughout I'm going to refer to the whole of 61 and the whole of 62 and so
[2036.06 → 2042.60] it will help you I think a lot to have a bible in your hands or in front of you on a device
[2042.60 → 2049.54] whatever the case may be so that as we refer back you can see where I'm looking as well
[2049.54 → 2056.36] let's read God's word together I'll start at verse 10 of Isaiah 61
[2056.36 → 2067.70] I delight greatly in the Lord my soul rejoices in my God for he has clothed me with garments of
[2067.70 → 2074.48] salvation and arrayed me in a robe of his righteousness as a bridegroom adorns his head
[2074.48 → 2081.50] like a priest and as a bride adorns her adorns herself with her jewels for as the soil makes
[2081.50 → 2088.16] the sprout come up and a garden causes seeds to grow, so the sovereign Lord will make righteousness
[2088.16 → 2100.78] and praise spring up before all nations for Zion's sake I will not keep silent for Jerusalem's sake I will
[2100.78 → 2108.24] not remain quiet till her vindication shines out like the dawn her salvation like a blazing torch
[2108.24 → 2116.08] the nations will see your vindication and all kings your glory you will be called by a new name that the
[2116.08 → 2124.24] mouth of the Lord will bestow you will be a crown of splendour in the Lord's hand a royal diadem in the hand
[2124.24 → 2127.62] of your God this is the word of the Lord
[2127.62 → 2144.56] so my question for us this morning is what has changed right we have had Christmas day and we
[2144.56 → 2157.20] basked together in the glory of Emmanuel of God with us and how are we supposed to respond to the God with us of Christmas
[2157.20 → 2166.22] right Emmanuel means God with us and surely that means something for more than just Christmas day
[2166.22 → 2179.70] that's what I want us to look at this morning if in the season of Advent we kind of looked at who God is in the
[2179.70 → 2189.40] servant who Jesus is coming as God as we looked at Emmanuel God with us today I want to shift and ask the
[2189.40 → 2195.44] question what does that question what does that mean for who you are and so if we've been looking at God's
[2195.44 → 2204.14] identity I want to see how that shapes our identity what I want to suggest to you this morning the theme
[2204.14 → 2214.10] for today the big idea falls under this heading the servant Messiah gives you a new name which comes with a new
[2214.10 → 2221.36] purpose because he reveals the fullness of God and the fullness of man
[2221.36 → 2230.90] now Emmanuel as we said God with us right reveals the fullness of God in some ways this is the first part
[2230.90 → 2239.94] of Colossians 2 verse 9 which says in Christ all the fullness of the deity lives in bodily form
[2239.94 → 2249.84] and Jesus the Lord of us the Lord of us the Lord of our salvation reveals the fullness of what it means to be
[2249.84 → 2258.84] human many ways this is the second part of Colossians 2 verse 9 which says in Christ you have been brought
[2258.84 → 2268.10] to fullness and so my contention for you this morning is that Jesus as the God man reveals the fullness of God
[2268.10 → 2281.20] and the fullness of man that Jesus shows us real humanity and all of this is mapped out I think in Isaiah 61 and 62
[2281.20 → 2289.40] now to get there we have to answer a couple questions and the first question that we'll wrestle with is who is
[2289.40 → 2300.16] speaking in this text the first challenge we have is in digging into this text is who is the voice that we are listening to
[2300.16 → 2307.66] right to understand what's being said we need to figure out who's saying it and so with your Bibles open
[2307.66 → 2317.18] starting at verse 1 of 61 follow the voice of the speaker and to do this look at the use of pronouns
[2317.18 → 2323.18] in this text that's how we're going to follow the voice and again if your Bibles are open this will
[2323.18 → 2329.76] make more sense to you as we see it together and so listen to these words from the first three verses
[2329.76 → 2331.06] of chapter 61.
[2333.12 → 2340.06] The spirit of the sovereign Lord is on me because the Lord has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor
[2340.06 → 2346.48] he sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for
[2346.48 → 2352.62] the prisoners to proclaim the year of the Lord's favour and the day of vengeance of our God to comfort
[2352.62 → 2359.84] all who mourn and provide for those who grieve in Zion to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of
[2359.84 → 2365.46] ashes the oil of joy instead of mourning and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair
[2365.46 → 2374.48] they will be called oaks of righteousness a planting of the Lord for the display of his splendour
[2374.48 → 2375.04] splendour.
[2377.28 → 2386.12] What we see in Isaiah 61 is the coming together of two different voices that we've already heard
[2386.12 → 2388.64] in this Advent and Christmas season.
[2389.90 → 2394.08] One of the voices that we've heard starts in chapter 40.
[2394.62 → 2398.10] Kevin pointed this out to us when he preached a few weeks ago.
[2398.30 → 2399.92] It's the voice of the servant.
[2399.92 → 2406.98] Right in Isaiah 42 we can read about the servant the suffering servant in 49 and 50 and 52 and 53.
[2406.98 → 2414.28] Right and the servant is identified as the one on whom the spirit of God rests.
[2415.36 → 2418.26] Right Josh preached on this for us.
[2418.80 → 2426.94] This is the voice of the servant who will release captives in chapter 49 who will bring righteousness to the people in chapter 53.
[2426.94 → 2432.96] Each aspect of what the servant does in our text in chapter 61.
[2433.60 → 2439.50] Right the spirit of the sovereign Lord is on me to proclaim freedom for captives and release the prisoners from darkness.
[2440.04 → 2443.20] They the people of Zion will be called oaks of righteousness.
[2443.80 → 2447.58] Each thing the servant says is something the servant has already said.
[2447.66 → 2450.24] This is the voice of the servant.
[2450.24 → 2457.42] And then the second voice that we've been hearing from in Isaiah is the anointed one.
[2457.58 → 2459.10] The Messiah the king.
[2459.84 → 2467.44] Right in chapter 9 all the way back at the beginning of our Advent season we read about a son who will put the government on his shoulders.
[2467.44 → 2470.72] Who will reign on David's throne and over his kingdom forever.
[2470.72 → 2478.18] And then in chapter 11 of Isaiah the son who is king is shown to be the Messiah the anointed one.
[2478.60 → 2482.72] Right the spirit of the Lord will rest on him who is a branch from Jesse's stem.
[2483.76 → 2489.92] His instrument will be we read the rod of his mouth which is something we saw to be the word of the Lord.
[2489.92 → 2501.02] And notice then in Isaiah 61 this voice comes to preach good news to proclaim freedom and to proclaim the year of the Lord's favour.
[2502.16 → 2506.38] In Isaiah 11 righteousness will be his belt and with righteousness he will judge.
[2506.78 → 2513.22] And the Messiah comes to establish righteousness which again is what this person here is doing.
[2513.98 → 2518.82] Right because of his work and his coming they will be called oaks of righteousness.
[2518.82 → 2526.24] The Messiah of chapter 11 and his coming results in the glorious exaltation of God.
[2526.36 → 2528.44] The zeal of the Lord will accomplish this.
[2528.90 → 2533.94] And in chapter 61 this will be a display of his splendour.
[2535.06 → 2540.24] And so throughout we've heard these two voices the suffering servant and the Messiah king.
[2540.24 → 2548.18] And in the first three verses of chapter 61 these two voices come together.
[2548.18 → 2550.82] In one person.
[2552.02 → 2558.44] And we've heard about the suffering servant and the Messiah king and all that builds and builds on itself.
[2558.44 → 2563.62] Coming together in one voice one person the servant Messiah.
[2564.66 → 2569.18] And again Messiah means God's anointed means king ruler over all.
[2569.18 → 2574.30] And what we're reading and learning is that he would be the servant of all.
[2575.24 → 2582.06] Right the suffering servant the one who comes not to be served but to serve and give his life as a ransom for many.
[2582.06 → 2587.80] Would be God's anointed who comes to destroy God's enemies with the word of his mouth.
[2588.70 → 2592.48] One person suffering servant and anointed Messiah.
[2592.72 → 2595.14] One person meekness and majesty.
[2595.38 → 2598.68] One person the servant Messiah.
[2598.68 → 2600.50] One person the Lord that he would be the servant of all.
[2600.50 → 2612.82] And so it doesn't surprise us as readers of the New Testament that when Jesus comes on the scene grown as an adult and begins his preaching ministry.
[2612.82 → 2617.18] He does so by reading from Isaiah 61.
[2617.18 → 2622.24] Right the suffering servant is the anointed Messiah.
[2622.24 → 2627.84] and in Luke 4 you can read about Jesus in the synagogue taking the scroll and reading this
[2627.84 → 2635.64] text from Isaiah 61 and then saying today in your hearing this scripture is fulfilled.
[2636.60 → 2644.36] Jesus is the servant Messiah. Jesus is God's anointed. Jesus is the ruler who came to serve
[2644.36 → 2651.28] and not be served. Jesus is the one who gave his life as a ransom for many. Jesus is the one
[2651.28 → 2658.98] who's worshipped as king by wise men who came from the east. Jesus is the one who would live life in
[2658.98 → 2665.30] your place providing the righteousness that you need, and he would die death in your place taking
[2665.30 → 2670.88] the punishment that we all deserve and doing it all for whoever will believe and put their trust
[2670.88 → 2680.78] and their faith in him. Jesus is the servant Messiah whose voice we hear in chapter 61.
[2681.28 → 2687.82] And then as we keep reading through Isaiah verses 4 through 7 really starting in verse 3 but
[2687.82 → 2697.14] verses 4 through 7 make up the content of what he comes to preach. Remember we're following the voice
[2697.14 → 2702.04] and we're doing that by looking at the pronouns for help and so if you look at the pronouns there
[2702.04 → 2708.86] these verses become the substance of what the servant Messiah is preaching what he will declare.
[2708.86 → 2716.62] Right this will be a new reality for those who come under his grace and mercy. This is the good news.
[2716.72 → 2725.18] This is the gospel. Right he will bestow on them a crown of beauty. They will be oaks of righteousness
[2725.18 → 2731.68] for the display of the Lord's splendour. That is our chief end the purpose for which we are created
[2731.68 → 2741.22] and recreated in grace is to glorify God and enjoy him forever. Right they will rebuild and renew a huge hope
[2741.22 → 2747.24] for those who are living in exile who are living apart from their homes. Right the gospel creates a community
[2747.24 → 2755.30] that builds and that renews those around it. Translate that into today and think of the communities who have built
[2755.30 → 2761.66] Christian schools and Christian universities who have built Christian churches and cultural centres.
[2762.16 → 2767.94] Think of people who have started a business as a disciple of Jesus and are trying to run them
[2767.94 → 2770.50] as Christian bosses in the world today.
[2772.88 → 2775.10] And in fact it goes even deeper.
[2775.10 → 2782.40] In verse 6 it's made more personal because the pronouns shift from they to you.
[2782.40 → 2791.36] You will be called priests of the Lord. You will be named ministers of our God. Instead of shame you will
[2791.36 → 2797.38] receive a double portion. Instead of disgrace you will rejoice in your inheritance. You will inherit a
[2797.38 → 2805.22] double portion and everlasting joy will be yours. Right in this chapter you have the coming together of two
[2805.22 → 2812.38] voices in Isaiah the Messiah King and the suffering servant into one person, and he speaks
[2812.38 → 2819.34] he preaches he proclaims to his affected his people made by his word.
[2821.52 → 2830.74] And then in verse 8 and maybe verse 9 there's an injection of God's voice. Right for I the Lord
[2830.74 → 2836.50] in my faithfulness I will reward my people. I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
[2836.50 → 2844.66] Right this is a stamp of approval a confirmation of promise. This is God saying what the servant has said is my word.
[2845.46 → 2852.24] This is an underlining. It's a statement of promise and assurance that this indeed will be the case.
[2853.58 → 2857.64] And so pull it all together. The servant Messiah's word is God's word.
[2857.64 → 2866.62] He speaks as one with authority. He has the words of eternal life. The servant Messiah is the word of God.
[2868.28 → 2869.78] And because of that
[2869.78 → 2871.54] in verse 10
[2871.54 → 2873.28] we hear a new voice.
[2873.78 → 2878.80] I delight greatly in the Lord. My soul rejoices
[2878.80 → 2881.22] in my God.
[2881.22 → 2884.18] So three voices.
[2885.30 → 2890.52] First the two voices of Isaiah coming together as one. The suffering servant and the Messiah King seen
[2890.52 → 2894.50] as one man. And then the content of what he speaks and promises.
[2895.04 → 2897.92] The effect of him making for himself a people.
[2898.48 → 2902.78] Followed by the voice of God to confirm and ensure gospel truth.
[2902.78 → 2904.54] And now a third voice.
[2904.92 → 2906.74] Right? I delight. My soul.
[2906.92 → 2909.30] Clothed me with garments of salvation.
[2909.50 → 2911.38] Arrayed me in robes of righteousness.
[2911.80 → 2913.26] And not just any righteousness. Right?
[2913.38 → 2915.58] In the text it says his righteousness.
[2917.38 → 2918.68] Right? Verse 10
[2918.68 → 2920.92] is the fulfillment of verse 3.
[2921.88 → 2922.96] It's the effect
[2922.96 → 2924.42] of the message he proclaimed.
[2924.82 → 2926.36] Right? Joy instead of mourning.
[2926.56 → 2929.06] Praise instead of despair. Oaks of righteousness
[2929.06 → 2930.66] displaying his splendour.
[2930.66 → 2932.42] That is for his glory.
[2932.78 → 2936.64] And so what is your proper response
[2936.64 → 2938.24] to the servant Messiah
[2938.24 → 2939.66] working in your life?
[2940.18 → 2942.26] What is your new identity?
[2943.28 → 2945.26] What is your response to the gospel
[2945.26 → 2947.52] that he accomplishes and he proclaims?
[2948.22 → 2949.54] It's rejoicing.
[2950.22 → 2951.48] It's praising.
[2952.42 → 2953.76] Right? Your response is
[2953.76 → 2954.58] worship.
[2955.50 → 2956.26] And
[2956.26 → 2957.94] your response
[2957.94 → 2960.08] is righteousness.
[2962.08 → 2962.76] Righteousness.
[2962.78 → 2965.92] You are clothed in his righteousness.
[2965.92 → 2967.36] And you've heard me say this before.
[2967.82 → 2969.76] Righteousness is an economic term
[2969.76 → 2971.50] before it's a theological one.
[2972.68 → 2974.28] And so this means a couple of things for us.
[2975.02 → 2976.68] Let's put some meat on these bones
[2976.68 → 2977.86] of the word righteousness.
[2978.44 → 2980.38] Clothed in righteousness means
[2980.38 → 2982.42] that you don't have to worry
[2982.42 → 2984.22] when yours falls short.
[2985.66 → 2986.08] Right?
[2986.08 → 2987.66] It means when the devil
[2987.66 → 2989.10] or when social media
[2989.10 → 2990.36] and maybe those two are the same
[2990.36 → 2991.54] when the devil
[2991.54 → 2992.36] or social media
[2992.36 → 2993.62] whispers in your ear
[2993.62 → 2994.82] you're not good enough
[2994.82 → 2996.40] you can say
[2996.40 → 2997.54] get behind me Satan
[2997.54 → 2999.20] because what matters
[2999.20 → 3000.78] is the righteousness of Christ
[3000.78 → 3001.74] given to me.
[3002.74 → 3003.72] It means that
[3003.72 → 3005.00] even though there's nothing
[3005.00 → 3005.74] you can do
[3005.74 → 3007.10] to earn your salvation
[3007.10 → 3008.54] he's done everything
[3008.54 → 3010.26] and he gives it to you freely
[3010.26 → 3011.28] by his grace.
[3011.28 → 3011.88] Grace.
[3011.88 → 3013.34] This clothing yourself
[3013.34 → 3014.74] being clothed
[3014.74 → 3015.70] in the righteousness
[3015.70 → 3017.18] of the servant Messiah
[3017.18 → 3018.80] means there is nothing
[3018.80 → 3020.74] nothing that can separate you
[3020.74 → 3021.72] from the love of God
[3021.72 → 3022.42] that is available
[3022.42 → 3024.10] in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[3024.26 → 3025.38] It means that the love
[3025.38 → 3027.00] that the Father has for the Son
[3027.00 → 3028.24] is the same love
[3028.24 → 3029.30] that he has for you.
[3030.10 → 3031.12] You've probably heard that before.
[3032.14 → 3033.72] Because when he looks at you
[3033.72 → 3036.16] he sees Christ.
[3036.16 → 3036.26] Christ.
[3039.20 → 3040.38] And righteousness
[3040.38 → 3042.30] is a term
[3042.30 → 3044.26] is a reality with legs.
[3044.90 → 3045.00] Right?
[3045.12 → 3046.42] Righteousness walks.
[3047.18 → 3049.34] Righteousness is an economic term
[3049.34 → 3051.54] even as it's a theological term.
[3051.86 → 3053.28] And so putting on Christ
[3053.28 → 3055.04] means walking with him
[3055.04 → 3056.54] living like him.
[3056.60 → 3058.34] It means obeying God's design
[3058.34 → 3059.94] not because you have to
[3059.94 → 3062.26] but because you believe it's good.
[3063.66 → 3063.76] Right?
[3063.76 → 3065.82] God's righteous plan for your life
[3065.82 → 3068.22] is his plan for your flourishing.
[3069.14 → 3070.14] The will of God
[3070.14 → 3071.08] his moral will
[3071.08 → 3072.04] his decretive will
[3072.04 → 3073.04] his sovereign will
[3073.04 → 3074.88] are good for you.
[3076.66 → 3078.80] Far from robbing you of joy
[3078.80 → 3080.40] when Jesus says
[3080.40 → 3081.20] if you love me
[3081.20 → 3082.48] you will keep my commandments
[3082.48 → 3084.44] he's offering you a glimpse
[3084.44 → 3086.62] of what your best life now looks like.
[3087.90 → 3088.02] Right?
[3088.10 → 3088.66] Obedience.
[3089.54 → 3091.48] Even obedience unto death.
[3092.22 → 3092.82] Right?
[3092.82 → 3094.42] Joining Christ in his suffering
[3094.42 → 3095.86] means joining him
[3095.86 → 3096.64] in his resurrection.
[3097.20 → 3098.76] Being obedient to his will
[3098.76 → 3101.16] is actually the way of joy.
[3103.16 → 3103.70] Right?
[3103.72 → 3105.24] If you listen to the voice
[3105.24 → 3107.36] of our culture and world
[3107.36 → 3108.76] and increasingly
[3108.76 → 3109.88] the same voice
[3109.88 → 3111.24] is heard everywhere.
[3112.14 → 3112.32] Right?
[3112.36 → 3113.54] You might think that
[3113.54 → 3115.42] sex apart from being married
[3115.42 → 3116.16] is good.
[3117.46 → 3118.54] What I want you to hear
[3118.54 → 3120.48] is that obedience to Jesus
[3120.48 → 3121.34] is better.
[3122.62 → 3123.06] Right?
[3123.10 → 3123.78] You might think that
[3123.78 → 3125.20] a little recreational drug use
[3125.20 → 3125.84] is good
[3125.84 → 3128.36] but obedience to Jesus
[3128.36 → 3129.20] is better.
[3130.32 → 3131.14] You might sit here
[3131.14 → 3132.12] rationalizing
[3132.12 → 3133.66] your pornography use
[3133.66 → 3134.18] saying look
[3134.18 → 3135.00] no one's getting hurt
[3135.00 → 3136.20] but walking in the way
[3136.20 → 3136.72] of Jesus
[3136.72 → 3137.90] and not even looking
[3137.90 → 3139.20] at a person lustfully
[3139.20 → 3140.20] is true life
[3140.20 → 3141.48] is full humanity.
[3143.14 → 3144.54] Now you might hear that
[3144.54 → 3145.28] and you might think
[3145.28 → 3146.22] but pastor
[3146.22 → 3147.14] that's impossible.
[3147.14 → 3149.20] to which I say
[3149.20 → 3150.70] refer back to number one.
[3152.26 → 3152.38] Right?
[3152.44 → 3153.22] Remember that's why
[3153.22 → 3154.74] theological and economic
[3154.74 → 3155.94] understandings of righteousness
[3155.94 → 3157.14] have to come together.
[3158.44 → 3159.68] Apart from him
[3159.68 → 3160.74] and his righteousness
[3160.74 → 3161.76] it is impossible.
[3162.70 → 3163.86] But thanks be to God
[3163.86 → 3165.18] he has given us the victory
[3165.18 → 3166.26] he has made us new
[3166.26 → 3168.38] he has transformed you
[3168.38 → 3170.16] and with that transformation
[3170.16 → 3172.00] with his setting you apart
[3172.00 → 3173.50] as a holy nation
[3173.50 → 3174.74] a royal priesthood
[3174.74 → 3176.20] a people belonging to God
[3176.20 → 3177.70] he has made you
[3177.70 → 3179.26] able to live for him
[3179.26 → 3182.22] because you love him
[3182.22 → 3184.12] and are loved by him.
[3184.24 → 3186.00] That is you live your life
[3186.00 → 3187.60] in the power of the spirit.
[3187.94 → 3188.94] You live your life
[3188.94 → 3191.02] in your new creation self
[3191.02 → 3192.84] your born again identity.
[3193.10 → 3195.30] You live with a new name.
[3197.08 → 3197.44] And look
[3197.44 → 3200.42] if there's a problem
[3200.42 → 3201.92] in the Christian church
[3201.92 → 3203.54] in the west today
[3203.54 → 3205.64] it's probably this.
[3206.20 → 3208.62] Christians come to church
[3208.62 → 3209.16] on Sunday
[3209.16 → 3210.46] professing the name of Jesus
[3210.46 → 3211.74] singing praises to God
[3211.74 → 3212.56] and then
[3212.56 → 3213.74] we walk out the door
[3213.74 → 3215.08] and we live like God
[3215.08 → 3215.74] isn't real.
[3216.80 → 3218.10] Like Jesus doesn't have
[3218.10 → 3219.28] authority in my life
[3219.28 → 3220.36] like he isn't the king
[3220.36 → 3221.04] of the universe.
[3222.06 → 3223.12] We live like God
[3223.12 → 3223.88] isn't sovereign
[3223.88 → 3224.82] or all the earth.
[3225.14 → 3226.22] We live like we haven't
[3226.22 → 3227.00] been transformed
[3227.00 → 3228.38] like Jesus hasn't overcome
[3228.38 → 3229.54] like we don't have
[3229.54 → 3230.58] the power of God
[3230.58 → 3231.52] in us.
[3232.58 → 3232.62] Right?
[3232.76 → 3233.54] We Christians
[3233.54 → 3234.52] look and live
[3234.52 → 3235.14] no different
[3235.14 → 3235.62] than the rest
[3235.62 → 3236.12] of the world
[3236.12 → 3237.30] who doesn't know God
[3237.30 → 3238.36] and we've neutered
[3238.36 → 3238.94] his power
[3238.94 → 3239.66] in our lives.
[3241.06 → 3242.34] But the gospel says
[3242.34 → 3243.88] you are no longer slaves.
[3244.36 → 3245.62] You are a child of God.
[3246.24 → 3247.14] You are his son.
[3248.26 → 3248.36] Right?
[3248.40 → 3248.90] Ask God
[3248.90 → 3249.40] today
[3249.40 → 3249.96] now
[3249.96 → 3250.72] to transform
[3250.72 → 3251.50] your life
[3251.50 → 3252.38] from the inside
[3252.38 → 3253.22] out.
[3253.48 → 3253.70] Right?
[3253.82 → 3254.82] That's the direction
[3254.82 → 3255.40] of righteousness
[3255.40 → 3256.16] by the way.
[3256.48 → 3256.62] Right?
[3256.70 → 3257.58] His righteousness
[3257.58 → 3258.80] given over to you
[3258.80 → 3259.86] transforming you
[3259.86 → 3260.88] turning your heart
[3260.88 → 3261.38] of stone
[3261.38 → 3262.12] into a heart
[3262.12 → 3262.58] of flesh
[3262.58 → 3264.02] that's inside work
[3264.02 → 3264.82] and then
[3264.82 → 3265.38] and then
[3265.38 → 3265.84] what happens
[3265.84 → 3266.78] on the inside
[3266.78 → 3267.90] works its way
[3267.90 → 3268.64] outside
[3268.64 → 3269.88] and so ask God
[3269.88 → 3271.26] to transform your life
[3271.26 → 3271.84] and then
[3271.84 → 3273.10] go from this place
[3273.10 → 3274.36] living your life
[3274.36 → 3275.60] with discipline
[3275.60 → 3276.98] as one transformed.
[3277.54 → 3278.90] Work out your salvation
[3278.90 → 3280.50] as God's righteousness
[3280.50 → 3281.96] works out
[3281.96 → 3283.22] of you.
[3284.38 → 3285.38] Don't settle
[3285.38 → 3286.32] for slavery.
[3287.56 → 3289.70] Pursue your new humanity
[3289.70 → 3290.52] as children
[3290.52 → 3291.40] of God.
[3291.56 → 3292.44] Pursue life
[3292.44 → 3294.40] as his son.
[3298.32 → 3299.20] And then
[3299.20 → 3303.94] take this message
[3303.94 → 3304.40] with you.
[3305.70 → 3307.00] For Zion's sake
[3307.00 → 3308.52] I will not keep silent.
[3308.66 → 3309.76] We're in chapter 62.
[3310.42 → 3311.80] For Jerusalem's sake
[3311.80 → 3312.70] I will not remain
[3312.70 → 3313.92] quiet
[3313.92 → 3315.42] till her vindication
[3315.42 → 3316.20] shines out
[3316.20 → 3316.80] like the dawn
[3316.80 → 3317.74] her salvation
[3317.74 → 3318.96] like a blazing torch
[3318.96 → 3319.80] the nations
[3319.80 → 3320.40] will see
[3320.40 → 3321.18] your vindication
[3321.18 → 3321.94] and all kings
[3321.94 → 3322.44] your glory
[3322.44 → 3323.42] and you will be
[3323.42 → 3324.74] called by a new name
[3324.74 → 3325.40] that the mouth
[3325.40 → 3326.10] of the Lord
[3326.10 → 3327.06] will bestow.
[3327.22 → 3327.88] You will be
[3327.88 → 3328.54] a crown
[3328.54 → 3329.38] of splendour
[3329.38 → 3330.30] in the Lord's hand
[3330.30 → 3331.68] a royal diadem
[3331.68 → 3332.74] in the hand
[3332.74 → 3333.82] of your God.
[3335.48 → 3336.50] And in chapter 61
[3336.50 → 3337.62] the servant Messiah
[3337.62 → 3338.54] transforms
[3338.54 → 3339.60] by his gospel
[3339.60 → 3340.50] and now
[3340.50 → 3341.34] those who are
[3341.34 → 3342.04] transformed
[3342.04 → 3343.32] by the gospel
[3343.32 → 3344.74] proclaim the same
[3344.74 → 3345.50] message.
[3345.70 → 3346.72] For Zion's sake
[3346.72 → 3347.62] I will not keep
[3347.62 → 3348.04] silent.
[3348.04 → 3349.12] I will not remain
[3349.12 → 3349.56] quiet.
[3350.12 → 3350.68] The nations
[3350.68 → 3351.50] will see
[3351.50 → 3352.26] what the servant
[3352.26 → 3353.26] Messiah has done
[3353.26 → 3354.04] and kings
[3354.04 → 3354.86] will hear
[3354.86 → 3355.76] of his glory
[3355.76 → 3357.18] because the servant
[3357.18 → 3358.32] Messiah will
[3358.32 → 3359.10] proclaim it
[3359.10 → 3360.40] and he proclaims
[3360.40 → 3361.16] it through a
[3361.16 → 3362.52] people who go
[3362.52 → 3363.56] out to declare
[3363.56 → 3364.52] the praises of him
[3364.52 → 3365.16] who has called you
[3365.16 → 3365.68] out of darkness
[3365.68 → 3366.88] into his wonderful
[3366.88 → 3367.20] light.
[3368.44 → 3369.68] In verse 62
[3369.68 → 3371.00] we switch back
[3371.00 → 3371.64] to the voice
[3371.64 → 3372.38] of the servant
[3372.38 → 3373.86] Messiah who says
[3373.86 → 3374.88] that he will not
[3374.88 → 3376.06] keep silent
[3376.06 → 3377.28] and so we
[3377.28 → 3378.20] will not keep
[3378.20 → 3378.96] silent.
[3379.42 → 3380.16] We don't go out
[3380.16 → 3380.68] and preach
[3380.68 → 3381.48] because he told
[3381.48 → 3381.88] us to
[3381.88 → 3382.56] we preach
[3382.56 → 3383.40] because he is
[3383.40 → 3384.18] preaching through
[3384.18 → 3384.72] us.
[3385.66 → 3386.34] The word of the
[3386.34 → 3386.96] Lord that you
[3386.96 → 3387.46] declare
[3387.46 → 3388.16] the praises
[3388.16 → 3389.08] that you declare
[3389.08 → 3390.00] the gospel
[3390.00 → 3391.16] that you tell
[3391.16 → 3391.94] is Jesus
[3391.94 → 3392.74] the servant
[3392.74 → 3393.26] Messiah
[3393.26 → 3394.78] declaring in you
[3394.78 → 3395.92] and through you
[3395.92 → 3396.88] to the world.
[3398.44 → 3399.48] There's confirmation
[3399.48 → 3400.22] of this.
[3401.68 → 3403.08] You will be called
[3403.08 → 3404.48] by a new name
[3404.48 → 3405.30] that the mouth
[3405.30 → 3405.94] of the Lord
[3405.94 → 3406.60] will bestow.
[3407.60 → 3408.80] You will be a crown
[3408.80 → 3409.60] of splendour
[3409.60 → 3410.62] in the Lord's hand.
[3411.60 → 3412.24] Note that, right?
[3412.36 → 3413.06] A new name
[3413.06 → 3414.52] and a crown.
[3416.32 → 3416.80] Now to see
[3416.80 → 3418.18] the culmination
[3418.18 → 3418.70] of this
[3418.70 → 3419.74] I want to jump
[3419.74 → 3420.32] for a second
[3420.32 → 3421.60] to Revelation 3.
[3422.78 → 3424.04] In Revelation 3
[3424.04 → 3425.36] we read
[3425.36 → 3426.42] at the beginning
[3426.42 → 3427.10] of Revelation
[3427.10 → 3428.62] John records
[3428.62 → 3429.36] messages
[3429.36 → 3430.18] or sermons
[3430.18 → 3430.82] from Jesus
[3430.82 → 3431.62] to the churches
[3431.62 → 3432.62] and Jesus
[3432.62 → 3433.68] refers to the
[3433.68 → 3434.26] people of
[3434.26 → 3434.84] these seven
[3434.84 → 3435.26] churches
[3435.26 → 3437.18] as those
[3437.18 → 3437.76] who endure
[3437.76 → 3438.22] right?
[3438.30 → 3438.84] As the one
[3438.84 → 3439.84] who is victorious
[3439.84 → 3441.14] or a previous
[3441.14 → 3441.58] translation
[3441.58 → 3442.24] those who have
[3442.24 → 3442.82] overcome
[3442.82 → 3443.94] to the one
[3443.94 → 3444.66] who overcomes
[3444.66 → 3446.00] and to the church
[3446.00 → 3446.82] in Philadelphia
[3446.82 → 3447.84] Jesus says
[3447.84 → 3448.48] and remember
[3448.48 → 3449.84] those words
[3449.84 → 3451.20] from Isaiah 62
[3451.20 → 3451.96] that language
[3451.96 → 3452.56] he says
[3452.56 → 3454.26] hold on
[3454.26 → 3454.82] to what you
[3454.82 → 3455.30] have
[3455.30 → 3456.44] so that no
[3456.44 → 3457.04] one will
[3457.04 → 3457.86] take your
[3457.86 → 3459.10] crown.
[3459.10 → 3460.88] the one
[3460.88 → 3461.28] who is
[3461.28 → 3461.90] victorious
[3461.90 → 3462.48] I will
[3462.48 → 3462.96] make a
[3462.96 → 3463.22] pillar
[3463.22 → 3463.62] in the
[3463.62 → 3463.90] temple
[3463.90 → 3464.30] of my
[3464.30 → 3464.58] God
[3464.58 → 3465.14] never
[3465.14 → 3465.58] again
[3465.58 → 3465.80] will
[3465.80 → 3465.94] they
[3465.94 → 3466.28] leave it
[3466.28 → 3467.00] I will
[3467.00 → 3467.36] write
[3467.36 → 3468.22] my name
[3468.22 → 3468.84] I will
[3468.84 → 3469.20] write on
[3469.20 → 3469.42] him
[3469.42 → 3470.00] the name
[3470.00 → 3470.40] of my
[3470.40 → 3470.74] God
[3470.74 → 3471.08] and the
[3471.08 → 3471.42] name
[3471.42 → 3471.80] of the
[3471.80 → 3472.04] city
[3472.04 → 3472.42] of my
[3472.42 → 3472.70] God
[3472.70 → 3473.12] the new
[3473.12 → 3473.52] Jerusalem
[3473.52 → 3473.88] which is
[3473.88 → 3474.36] coming down
[3474.36 → 3474.62] out of
[3474.62 → 3474.80] heaven
[3474.80 → 3475.38] from my
[3475.38 → 3475.62] God
[3475.62 → 3476.54] and I
[3476.54 → 3476.74] will
[3476.74 → 3477.08] write
[3477.08 → 3477.38] on
[3477.38 → 3477.90] them
[3477.90 → 3478.60] my
[3478.60 → 3479.48] new
[3479.48 → 3480.56] name
[3480.56 → 3482.16] whoever
[3482.16 → 3482.50] has
[3482.50 → 3483.00] ears
[3483.00 → 3483.42] let them
[3483.42 → 3483.76] hear
[3483.76 → 3484.20] what the
[3484.20 → 3484.48] spirit
[3484.48 → 3485.08] says
[3485.08 → 3486.02] to the
[3486.02 → 3486.52] churches
[3486.52 → 3488.78] you see
[3488.78 → 3488.98] what's
[3488.98 → 3489.46] going on
[3489.46 → 3490.00] here
[3490.00 → 3491.34] right
[3491.34 → 3491.64] you have
[3491.64 → 3492.22] a crown
[3492.22 → 3493.34] a crown
[3493.34 → 3493.94] of beauty
[3493.94 → 3494.60] and of
[3494.60 → 3495.04] glory
[3495.04 → 3495.52] God's
[3495.52 → 3495.84] own
[3495.84 → 3496.30] glory
[3496.30 → 3496.96] and the
[3496.96 → 3497.22] beauty
[3497.22 → 3497.56] of his
[3497.56 → 3497.90] son
[3497.90 → 3498.50] Jesus
[3498.50 → 3498.90] our
[3498.90 → 3499.36] Messiah
[3499.36 → 3499.76] servant
[3499.76 → 3500.48] you have
[3500.48 → 3500.92] a crown
[3500.92 → 3501.42] because
[3501.42 → 3502.24] he has
[3502.24 → 3502.86] a crown
[3502.86 → 3503.60] and you've
[3503.60 → 3504.36] been clothed
[3504.36 → 3504.66] with
[3504.66 → 3505.38] Christ
[3505.38 → 3505.82] right
[3505.82 → 3506.00] you're
[3506.00 → 3506.24] wearing
[3506.24 → 3506.62] Christ
[3506.62 → 3506.98] like a
[3506.98 → 3507.24] garment
[3507.24 → 3507.52] and that
[3507.52 → 3507.94] includes
[3507.94 → 3508.16] his
[3508.16 → 3508.38] crown
[3508.38 → 3508.80] you've
[3508.80 → 3509.00] put
[3509.00 → 3509.52] on
[3509.52 → 3510.18] Christ
[3510.18 → 3510.76] and now
[3510.76 → 3511.74] you display
[3511.74 → 3512.50] his
[3512.50 → 3513.22] glory
[3513.22 → 3513.68] fully
[3513.68 → 3514.14] human
[3514.14 → 3514.52] fully
[3514.52 → 3515.00] alive
[3515.00 → 3515.76] in obedience
[3515.76 → 3516.92] to him
[3516.92 → 3517.54] his
[3517.54 → 3518.24] righteousness
[3518.24 → 3519.02] is your
[3519.02 → 3519.52] crown
[3519.52 → 3520.20] and his
[3520.20 → 3520.76] righteousness
[3520.76 → 3521.46] lived in
[3521.46 → 3521.94] your life
[3521.94 → 3522.62] is a royal
[3522.62 → 3523.40] diadem
[3523.40 → 3523.90] in the
[3523.90 → 3524.40] hand of
[3524.40 → 3524.84] your God
[3524.84 → 3525.54] Jesus
[3525.54 → 3526.30] reveals
[3526.30 → 3526.90] the fullness
[3526.90 → 3527.58] of God
[3527.58 → 3528.60] and the
[3528.60 → 3528.96] fullness
[3528.96 → 3530.24] of man
[3530.24 → 3532.94] but what else
[3532.94 → 3533.18] does the
[3533.18 → 3533.38] servant
[3533.38 → 3533.70] Messiah
[3533.70 → 3534.04] say
[3534.04 → 3535.74] he says
[3535.74 → 3536.10] you will
[3536.10 → 3536.64] be called
[3536.64 → 3537.58] by a new
[3537.58 → 3538.06] name that
[3538.06 → 3538.48] the mouth
[3538.48 → 3538.82] of the
[3538.82 → 3539.10] Lord
[3539.10 → 3540.26] will bestow
[3540.26 → 3542.18] the mouth
[3542.18 → 3542.46] of the
[3542.46 → 3542.70] Lord
[3542.70 → 3544.38] the word
[3544.38 → 3545.24] of the
[3545.24 → 3545.50] Lord
[3545.50 → 3546.66] the eternal
[3546.66 → 3547.04] word
[3547.04 → 3547.42] who took
[3547.42 → 3547.62] on
[3547.62 → 3548.10] flesh
[3548.10 → 3548.92] Jesus
[3548.92 → 3549.72] the word
[3549.72 → 3550.24] of God
[3550.24 → 3550.90] incarnate
[3550.90 → 3551.74] will give
[3551.74 → 3552.26] you a
[3552.26 → 3552.54] new
[3552.54 → 3553.30] name
[3553.30 → 3554.94] right
[3554.94 → 3555.20] to the
[3555.20 → 3555.60] one who
[3555.60 → 3555.82] is
[3555.82 → 3556.32] victorious
[3556.32 → 3556.68] I
[3556.68 → 3556.88] will
[3556.88 → 3557.18] write
[3557.18 → 3557.68] on them
[3557.68 → 3558.26] the name
[3558.26 → 3558.60] of my
[3558.60 → 3558.92] God
[3558.92 → 3559.20] and the
[3559.20 → 3559.46] name
[3559.46 → 3559.72] of the
[3559.72 → 3559.94] city
[3559.94 → 3560.32] of my
[3560.32 → 3560.60] God
[3560.60 → 3561.24] the new
[3561.24 → 3561.68] Jerusalem
[3561.68 → 3562.04] which is
[3562.04 → 3562.54] coming down
[3562.54 → 3562.96] out of
[3562.96 → 3563.14] heaven
[3563.14 → 3563.68] from my
[3563.68 → 3563.94] God
[3563.94 → 3564.54] and I
[3564.54 → 3564.68] will
[3564.68 → 3565.00] write
[3565.00 → 3565.60] on them
[3565.60 → 3566.10] my
[3566.10 → 3566.78] new
[3566.78 → 3567.48] name
[3567.48 → 3570.00] okay
[3570.00 → 3571.96] in the
[3571.96 → 3572.22] ancient
[3572.22 → 3572.64] world
[3572.64 → 3574.18] world
[3574.18 → 3576.12] and in the
[3576.12 → 3576.66] world
[3576.66 → 3576.86] of magic
[3576.86 → 3577.32] and this idea is still around today
[3577.32 → 3578.56] or maybe it's better to say
[3578.56 → 3581.06] as Christianity in the west has
[3581.06 → 3582.80] started to recede
[3582.80 → 3585.04] paganism is rushing back in
[3585.04 → 3586.48] and so this idea still persists
[3586.48 → 3589.22] but the idea is that to know someone's name
[3589.22 → 3591.36] especially their true name
[3591.36 → 3592.92] is to have power over them
[3592.92 → 3596.70] but to be called by God's name
[3596.70 → 3598.30] is to be under his protection
[3598.30 → 3599.36] his rule
[3599.36 → 3600.34] and his power
[3600.34 → 3602.14] to be called by God's name
[3602.14 → 3603.26] is to be under his
[3603.26 → 3604.58] fatherly hand
[3604.58 → 3605.60] and kingly
[3605.60 → 3606.30] rule
[3606.30 → 3608.52] right that's why the priestly
[3608.52 → 3610.50] blessing ends the way it does
[3610.50 → 3612.48] do you remember this one
[3612.48 → 3613.78] right we hear it often
[3613.78 → 3614.90] numbers six
[3614.90 → 3616.46] the priestly blessing
[3616.46 → 3618.50] the Lord said to Moses
[3618.50 → 3619.90] tell Aaron and his sons
[3619.90 → 3622.24] this is how you are to bless the Israelites
[3622.24 → 3624.58] and so the church has used this blessing
[3624.58 → 3625.80] since this time
[3625.80 → 3627.40] saying the Lord bless you
[3627.40 → 3628.08] and keep you
[3628.08 → 3629.16] the Lord make his face
[3629.16 → 3630.12] to shine on you
[3630.12 → 3631.40] and be gracious to you
[3631.40 → 3633.22] the Lord turn his face
[3633.22 → 3633.98] towards you
[3633.98 → 3635.10] and give you
[3635.10 → 3635.72] his
[3635.72 → 3636.78] peace
[3636.78 → 3638.90] and then this line
[3638.90 → 3640.74] so
[3640.74 → 3642.68] they will put my name
[3642.68 → 3643.92] on the Israelites
[3643.92 → 3646.02] and I will bless them
[3646.02 → 3649.44] they will put my name
[3649.44 → 3650.14] on them
[3650.14 → 3650.76] and I
[3650.76 → 3651.44] will
[3651.44 → 3652.26] bless them
[3652.26 → 3652.98] often when we
[3652.98 → 3653.92] end our worship
[3653.92 → 3654.74] with this blessing
[3654.74 → 3656.28] we don't read that last line
[3656.28 → 3657.34] but if you've got the ears
[3657.34 → 3657.78] to hear it
[3657.78 → 3658.94] whenever we do a baptism
[3658.94 → 3660.22] in this church
[3660.22 → 3661.62] I add it back
[3661.62 → 3663.50] because this is about
[3663.50 → 3664.52] our identity
[3664.52 → 3665.62] about the name
[3665.62 → 3666.22] of the covenant
[3666.22 → 3667.42] God going on
[3667.42 → 3668.02] his covenant
[3668.02 → 3668.76] children
[3668.76 → 3670.06] God's name
[3670.06 → 3670.98] makes us
[3670.98 → 3671.76] a people
[3671.76 → 3672.72] a holy
[3672.72 → 3673.50] nation
[3673.50 → 3675.12] this is who you are
[3675.12 → 3678.34] this is why Jesus says
[3678.34 → 3679.18] that he will give us
[3679.18 → 3680.12] the name of the city
[3680.12 → 3680.86] of my God
[3680.86 → 3681.68] the new Jerusalem
[3681.68 → 3682.92] which comes down
[3682.92 → 3683.54] out of heaven
[3683.54 → 3684.78] over and over
[3684.78 → 3685.92] we read in the Bible
[3685.92 → 3686.74] things like
[3686.74 → 3687.72] once you were not
[3687.72 → 3688.20] a people
[3688.20 → 3689.68] but now you are
[3689.68 → 3690.64] the people of God
[3690.64 → 3691.46] we read that our
[3691.46 → 3691.90] citizenship
[3691.90 → 3693.02] is in heaven
[3693.02 → 3694.26] we read that we belong
[3694.26 → 3694.76] to God
[3694.76 → 3695.48] and our citizens
[3695.48 → 3696.72] of his kingdom
[3696.72 → 3697.72] that our citizenship
[3697.72 → 3699.16] is in the new Jerusalem
[3699.16 → 3699.84] right
[3699.84 → 3700.78] this is replete
[3700.78 → 3702.06] throughout our
[3702.06 → 3702.78] New Testament
[3702.78 → 3703.70] identities
[3703.70 → 3704.76] we are a new
[3704.76 → 3705.76] creation people
[3705.76 → 3706.84] by grace
[3706.84 → 3707.86] through faith
[3707.86 → 3708.84] made into
[3708.84 → 3709.64] a holy
[3709.64 → 3710.58] nation
[3710.58 → 3712.06] that's what happens
[3712.06 → 3713.34] when you are clothed
[3713.34 → 3714.50] with Christ
[3714.50 → 3717.06] and Jesus says
[3717.06 → 3717.72] that he will write
[3717.72 → 3718.26] on us
[3718.26 → 3719.74] his new
[3719.74 → 3720.46] name
[3720.46 → 3722.56] Isaiah 62
[3722.56 → 3723.42] says that we will be
[3723.42 → 3724.48] called by a new name
[3724.48 → 3725.40] and Revelation 3
[3725.40 → 3726.52] says that that new
[3726.52 → 3727.34] name will be
[3727.34 → 3727.72] Jesus
[3727.72 → 3728.72] new

[3765.18 → 3765.68] visible
[3765.68 → 3766.82] by the way
[3766.82 → 3767.26] you live

[3774.66 → 3775.92] how you
[3775.92 → 3776.46] are still
[3776.46 → 3776.86] living
[3776.86 → 3777.34] like he
[3777.34 → 3777.96] doesn't matter
[3777.96 → 3779.54] ask him
[3779.54 → 3780.18] to show you
[3780.18 → 3780.62] how you
[3780.62 → 3781.10] are living
[3781.10 → 3781.96] like he

[3783.48 → 3784.24] transformed you
[3784.24 → 3785.06] ask him
[3785.06 → 3788.04] but I would
[3788.04 → 3788.38] wager
[3788.38 → 3790.22] that you
[3790.22 → 3790.86] already know
[3790.86 → 3793.00] that you
[3793.00 → 3793.50] already know
[3793.50 → 3794.06] one or two

[3797.42 → 3798.24] the righteousness
[3798.24 → 3798.96] of God
[3798.96 → 3800.44] and so
[3800.44 → 3801.00] instead of
[3801.00 → 3801.58] asking him
[3801.58 → 3802.26] to show you
[3802.26 → 3804.54] maybe today's
[3804.54 → 3805.08] the day
[3805.08 → 3806.18] you commit

[3807.06 → 3808.18] of showing
[3808.18 → 3808.58] him

[3809.72 → 3810.16] that you
[3810.16 → 3810.68] can live
[3810.68 → 3811.14] as one
[3811.14 → 3812.06] victorious
[3812.06 → 3813.48] wouldn't that
