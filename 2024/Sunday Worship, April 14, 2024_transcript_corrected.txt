[1979.58 → 2009.56] What is that?
[2009.56 → 2039.56] Yeah?
[2039.56 → 2069.54] I hope you're here?
[2069.54 → 2099.52] Thank you.
[2099.54 → 2129.52] I don't know.

[2309.46 → 2339.44] Thank you.
[2339.44 → 2369.42] Thank you.
[2369.42 → 2399.42] And with that.
[2399.42 → 2429.40] We look at the
[2429.40 → 2459.38] and you're worthy of the
[2459.38 → 2489.36] and you're in the
[2489.36 → 2519.34] with the
[2519.34 → 2549.32] and for the
[2549.32 → 2579.30] and you're in the
[2579.30 → 2609.28] and you're in the
[2609.28 → 2639.26] and trust that you're in the
[2639.26 → 2669.24] and you're in the
[2669.24 → 2699.22] but in your name, but in your name, amen.
[2699.22 → 2729.20] Okay.
[2729.20 → 2759.18] And so, you're in the
[2759.18 → 2789.16] and you're in the
[2789.16 → 2819.14] and you're in the church,
[2819.14 → 2849.12] and how now, and how you're in the
[2849.12 → 2879.10] because our salvation,
[2879.10 → 2909.10] and you're in the Lord, and you're in the
[2909.10 → 2939.10] and you're in the end you're in the end you're in the
[2939.10 → 2969.10] and you're in the end you're in the
[2969.10 → 2999.10] and you're in the
[2999.10 → 3008.22] Now, I should also say that in our house, we are living in a very strange stage of life,
[3008.22 → 3014.76] where the telling of time matters with absolute precision. Because if one of my kids says,
[3014.76 → 3019.74] what time is it? And I have the audacity to say it's two o'clock, when they can see the clock,
[3019.74 → 3029.98] and it's 1.57, they go, Dad, it is 1.57. Okay, sorry. Although I can't get too mad, because I do appreciate
[3029.98 → 3042.74] the precision of language. But it's important for them and for us to understand what time it is.
[3042.74 → 3050.50] And not only is that true in the minutes of the day, not only is important for us to be able to
[3050.50 → 3057.68] read the clock of time for the day, but it's also important for us to read the clock of time
[3057.68 → 3066.52] in the grand sweep and movement of world history. And what I want to suggest to you today, and what
[3066.52 → 3073.06] I suggest Paul is getting at for us in this text, is this. Here's the sort of theme for our time
[3073.06 → 3084.16] together. Understanding what time it is helps us to know how we are to live in the world and towards
[3084.16 → 3092.50] what goal we are moving. And so being able to understand where it is in the story that we find
[3092.50 → 3100.56] ourselves helps us know what it means to live in that story and where that story is going.
[3102.18 → 3110.12] All right, the question, actually, what time is it, is one of those big worldview questions
[3110.12 → 3117.50] that philosophers talk about. It's actually one that was added to a pre-existing list by a theologian
[3117.50 → 3123.70] named N.T. Wright. Some of you are probably familiar with him. But back in the 80s already in this sort of
[3123.70 → 3132.22] characterization, two scholars, Middleton and Walsh, they listed for us four questions to consider
[3132.22 → 3139.24] in worldview. N.T. Wright adds the fifth one, what time is it? Those questions, I'll put them on the screen
[3139.24 → 3150.48] behind me, are where are we? That is, what is this? Right? Who are we? What is wrong? And what's the remedy?
[3150.62 → 3158.60] What's the solution? Right? These are the questions, the answers of which out of everyone in the world lives.
[3159.32 → 3164.70] And the fifth one that N.T. Wright adds, and that is kind of our focus today, is what time is it?
[3164.70 → 3174.30] Right? In a manner of speaking, the answer to these questions is the story that we live out of.
[3175.20 → 3184.16] And the answer to these questions lead to different lived priorities in the world.
[3184.84 → 3189.62] And so if you have different answers to the question, who am I, than someone else, that's going to change
[3189.62 → 3195.12] the way you interact. If you have different answers to the question, what's wrong in the world, it's going
[3195.12 → 3201.46] to change the solution, what's the remedy that you come to, and then you're going to live in a different
[3201.46 → 3211.42] way than someone else who thinks otherwise. And often, when people have the strongest and most, like,
[3211.58 → 3219.30] vitriolic disagreements about stuff kind of up here, it's because the stuff down here
[3219.30 → 3225.86] is different. They're operating out of a different way of seeing the world, a different way of being
[3225.86 → 3231.10] in the world. And so when you're talking about the stuff up here, you end up talking past each other.
[3232.40 → 3236.80] Right? In today's world, you see this so clearly in contemporary politics.
[3237.62 → 3242.92] It's just based on a different philosophical assumption about the world or the role of government
[3242.92 → 3244.28] government or whatever the case may be.
[3246.88 → 3252.00] Now, I've already mentioned politics, but let me give you an even more controversial example
[3252.00 → 3254.88] of what I'm talking about. And I hope you're ready for this.
[3256.64 → 3258.04] Pineapple on pizza.
[3260.94 → 3265.24] Yes. Oh, and then a vitriolic no. See, here it goes.
[3266.14 → 3272.24] Right? On the surface, it might seem like personal taste. Do you like it or don't you like it?
[3272.24 → 3278.60] But as you look a little bit deeper, right, it could be based on the assumptions that someone
[3278.60 → 3283.32] has about culinary traditions, about cultural preferences, even about identity.
[3284.30 → 3292.50] For example, right, a traditional Italian Nona may believe that pizza should adhere to traditional
[3292.50 → 3299.24] Italian ingredients and flavours. And maybe those that are grown within a 60-kilometer radius
[3299.24 → 3304.16] of the town that she grew up in. And there ain't no pineapples growing in Italy.
[3306.60 → 3315.44] Additionally, pineapple offends history and disrupts the authenticity of pizza.
[3316.86 → 3322.48] Now, on the other hand, of course, right, people not tied to those same traditions might see it as a
[3322.48 → 3329.04] delicious fusion of sweet and savoury flavours. They might embrace culinary experimentation and diversity,
[3329.42 → 3335.42] especially if you add a little bacon. See? I almost got someone to say amen. And if that's what
[3335.42 → 3341.90] you're saying amen for today, well, then come stick around for the end. Right? The seeming disagreement
[3341.90 → 3348.26] about pizza toppings can actually reveal deeper and more deeply held perspectives on cultural
[3348.26 → 3354.98] authenticity, on cultural appropriation, culinary invitation, or the flexibility of food traditions.
[3355.54 → 3361.72] It's not just about whether pineapple tastes good on pizza, but it's about what pizza and pineapple
[3361.72 → 3371.30] means to you. Now, that's a pretty controversial example. Let me give you a left controversial example,
[3371.30 → 3381.18] a nice easy one for us, the topic of sex education in schools. Now, on the surface, right, this might seem
[3381.18 → 3386.62] like a simple disagreement that revolves around information or what facts should be taught to
[3386.62 → 3392.10] students. And yet, I'm going to suggest and continue to suggest that it reflects deeper assumptions,
[3392.38 → 3399.44] deeper held values regarding human sexuality and morality and education. Right? On the one hand,
[3399.44 → 3406.16] you might have a person who advocates for comprehensive sex education that includes information
[3406.16 → 3412.64] about diverse orientations or gender identities and practices. They would argue that providing this
[3412.64 → 3419.56] kind of knowledge produces inclusivity, it reduces stigma, it empowers individuals to make informed
[3419.56 → 3424.66] decisions about their sexual health. And who's going to be against empowering individuals?
[3424.66 → 3431.56] And from their perspective, understanding and accepting diverse expressions is essential for
[3431.56 → 3437.48] creating more equitable and accepting societies. And who is going to be against equitable and
[3437.48 → 3444.90] acceptable societies? You might have another person, though, who would emphasize that sex and sexuality
[3444.90 → 3451.84] are inherently moral realities and inseparable from that. They might argue for the importance of
[3451.84 → 3458.64] these conversations being rooted in the family and the role of parental authority in educating children.
[3458.64 → 3466.72] They might argue that human flourishing is tied to living within and out of and in line with our
[3466.72 → 3473.88] purposes, that our identities aren't primarily rooted in desire or expression or in relationships with other
[3473.88 → 3480.32] people, but in relationship to the creator. Or, to complicate it even more,
[3480.32 → 3488.00] you will find people who will argue elements of both. But on the surface, it's not just about what
[3488.00 → 3495.60] information we're talking our kids with, it's so much more. And I trust that you are beginning to see that
[3495.60 → 3503.84] these top-level ideas or arguments are the outworking of these bottom-level, more fundamental questions of
[3503.84 → 3512.32] who are we, who am I, what's wrong in the world, and what's the answer. Your opinions up here are rooted in your
[3512.32 → 3520.80] beliefs down here. Now, this is where it gets fun, right? Because the answer to these questions, the ones that are
[3520.80 → 3529.84] down here, are largely presuppositional. That is, they're largely assumed, right? And it means that they also aren't
[3529.84 → 3538.00] scientifically determined, right? These aren't questions of weights and measures. These aren't
[3538.00 → 3545.28] questions of laws or physical properties. These are questions of meaning and purpose, right? Why does this
[3545.28 → 3552.00] matter? Why do I matter? Why is there something in the world rather than nothing? What's the point of it all?
[3552.00 → 3559.92] Right? This is the realm of philosophy and theology. This is where science gives way to story.
[3561.04 → 3572.88] And story shapes your worldview. Story here is worldview, right? And worldview is the lens by which you see
[3572.88 → 3578.88] everything in the world, the lens by which you view the world, the lens by which you make sense of
[3578.88 → 3586.88] everything in it. And right now, in the world today, there are certain communities and groups that are
[3586.88 → 3594.00] that are making much of what they have come to call the meaning crisis, right? And this is especially true
[3594.00 → 3603.92] among young people today. And a part of that sense of crisis is the result of a lacking or an inadequate
[3603.92 → 3613.20] shared story. And so in history, right? When we excised God, when we cut God out of our lives and out of our
[3613.20 → 3622.00] social realities together, when we rejected the community that was bound by him, we lose the answer to
[3622.00 → 3629.20] these questions. We lose our shared story. And so, of course, that meaning crisis results from that.
[3629.20 → 3643.36] But now, as Christians, right, we have a particular story to tell. And it's also a story by which we see
[3643.36 → 3652.56] the whole world. N.T. Wright calls the Christian story, as told in the Bible, the true story of the whole world.
[3652.56 → 3661.04] And actually, in our worship, we display this story every time we read a text. And maybe you've seen it.
[3661.28 → 3667.36] Before the text appears on-screen, behind me, it says what the text is. And then there's a slider
[3667.36 → 3675.12] along the bottom that locates where that book of the Bible is. And underneath that slider are a series
[3675.12 → 3683.04] of images. We can throw the images up. Well, there's the slider. And then go to the pictures. Beautiful.
[3684.40 → 3692.00] The true story of the whole world. Six parts. And these images there are given for you to help remember
[3692.00 → 3699.04] and to sink into you just what this story is. And it begins on the left in creation. You can't read the
[3699.04 → 3707.12] words probably underneath. But creation. God comes down and creates the world. God comes down in creation.
[3707.12 → 3712.96] He looks at the world, and he says, this is very good. God comes down, and he walks in the garden with Adam
[3712.96 → 3721.76] and Eve. And it was good. But then the next act of the story, what is pictured in the X there, is the act of
[3721.76 → 3729.52] rebellion. And sometimes we use the word fall for that. Although maybe fall isn't strong enough of a
[3729.52 → 3737.28] word. Because what took place was a rebellion of the creation, especially the human creation, against
[3737.28 → 3746.56] its creator. But God in his grace promises a people. That's the next arrow. He promises a people
[3746.56 → 3754.24] and to come back into the world and to restore and redeem them from their rebellion. And here you get
[3754.24 → 3762.48] the story of God promising first to Adam and Eve and then reiterating that promise to Noah and then
[3762.48 → 3768.48] saying again to Abraham. And then we can move through the story, right, into the judges and the kings and
[3768.48 → 3776.48] the prophets promising over and over and over again, I am your God. You are my people. This is who I
[3776.48 → 3783.84] am. This is who you are to be. And the culmination of that promise, the culmination of that movement
[3783.84 → 3792.40] in the story is the cross, is redemption. Right? And therein, the fulfillment of all that God had promised to
[3792.40 → 3799.76] the people come in flesh, in the person of Jesus, right, who takes on flesh the second person of the
[3799.76 → 3807.04] Trinity, infinite God becoming and found finite as a baby, first in a manger and then grown as a man,
[3807.04 → 3813.28] living life perfectly and dying death on the cross. And we just celebrated a couple of weeks ago, right,
[3813.28 → 3819.68] Easter Sunday and the empty tomb, the victory of God over sin and death. This is redemption.
[3819.68 → 3829.44] And then the next step of the story, right, after Jesus is ascended to the right hand of God, he sends out
[3829.44 → 3836.32] a people again. Right? And so beginning you have a promise to a people, and then you have a sending of a
[3836.32 → 3844.64] people. Those people go out with this message of redemption. They go out with the story. And one day, that last
[3844.64 → 3853.28] item there, that last act, again, the arrow coming down is the new creation. Because the new Jerusalem
[3853.28 → 3862.96] will descend and all of this world will be made new. Now, sometimes in the sort of broader evangelical
[3862.96 → 3869.36] culture that exists, people are surprised by the arrow at the end pointing down and not pointing up.
[3870.00 → 3874.56] Because they think, oh, isn't the end goal to get to heaven? Right? To leave this earth. But
[3874.56 → 3880.80] that's not it. Right? The real end goal is for God to come back down to this earth and to restore it all
[3881.20 → 3888.88] to his original perfect intent and design. So in the beginning, God comes down. In the redemption, God comes down.
[3888.88 → 3897.52] And in the end, God comes down again. This is our story. And maybe these images you can lock in your mind.
[3897.52 → 3903.44] And so when someone asks you, what does it mean to be Christian? You can say, to find ourselves rooted in a story.
[3903.44 → 3907.92] Well, what story? Well, let me draw six pictures for you. And there you go.
[3909.68 → 3921.68] The question for today is, what is your place in this story? Where are we in the true story of the whole world?
[3921.68 → 3928.56] What does Paul say in our text? He says, understanding the present time.
[3930.24 → 3935.52] That's the question we're asking. Right? How do we understand the present hour?
[3936.24 → 3942.48] And in this picture, you can see there are six parts to the story. And we are somewhere between the last two.
[3942.48 → 3949.52] Right? Between that sending of a people and the new creation. We are in, maybe you could call it part 5.5.
[3951.52 → 3957.36] Green and Bartholomew, who were both teachers of mine in university, they wrote a book called The Drama of Scripture.
[3957.36 → 3966.72] They map this out. They call our present time, Act 5, Scene 2. Picking up on theatre and drama.
[3967.44 → 3972.80] That's what time it is. This is where we are in the story. Act 5, Scene 2.
[3972.80 → 3982.80] And understanding that has a huge impact on how we see and understand the world and our place in it.
[3984.16 → 3992.28] Now, I can see that some of you are wondering, why does this actually matter?
[3993.14 → 3997.32] Some of you are starting to sleep on this and say, okay, get to the point, Pastor.
[3997.32 → 4007.90] But Paul actually recognizes that too. And he says, right, he says, the hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber.
[4009.16 → 4013.34] The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber. Paul's saying, don't sleep on this truth.
[4015.18 → 4025.20] Don't miss the fact that this is where we are. This is what time it is. He says, our salvation is nearer now than when we first believe.
[4025.20 → 4029.48] Right, here's a truth of the Bible for you.
[4030.56 → 4037.70] As Christians, we believe that we are saved. This is Ephesians 2, verse 8.
[4037.78 → 4041.76] It is by grace you have been saved through faith. We are saved.
[4041.82 → 4045.44] And as Christians, we believe that we are being saved.
[4045.72 → 4047.84] This is 1 Corinthians 1, 18.
[4047.84 → 4056.22] The message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God.
[4056.30 → 4060.98] We believe we are being saved, and we believe that we will be saved.
[4061.08 → 4063.38] This is Romans 5, verse 8.
[4063.80 → 4071.52] Since we have been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him?
[4071.52 → 4073.84] Shall we be saved? We are saved.
[4074.08 → 4077.20] We are being saved, and we will be saved.
[4077.52 → 4081.38] Our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.
[4082.44 → 4087.30] And in this journey, in this present time, in this story,
[4087.30 → 4092.60] we've got one foot firmly rooted in both realities.
[4092.60 → 4097.86] One foot in this world, subject to its emperors and governing authorities,
[4098.14 → 4103.24] and one foot in the world to come, subject to the law of love.
[4103.38 → 4105.92] And that's what Paul wants you to wake up to.
[4106.94 → 4109.98] Right, the idea that this isn't all there is.
[4109.98 → 4116.24] And that when things are great, when your life is awesome,
[4116.36 → 4121.98] even on the best day of your life, remember, it will be better.
[4123.42 → 4128.70] And then also, remember, when things are awful on the worst day of your life,
[4128.76 → 4132.90] on the most difficult, most tragic moment that you have ever faced,
[4132.94 → 4138.36] when it feels all-consuming, remember that this isn't all there is.
[4138.36 → 4142.34] Right, this isn't the end of the story.
[4143.36 → 4147.70] Even if it happens to be the end of your story, it's not the end of the story.
[4147.86 → 4154.24] And actually, if by grace through faith you believe that you belong to this story,
[4154.44 → 4157.56] the end of your story isn't the end of your story,
[4158.46 → 4159.64] because this is your story.
[4160.20 → 4163.12] The new creation is your story.
[4164.58 → 4167.68] Now, some people, when they read this text, and others like it,
[4167.68 → 4170.86] they look at Paul here and what he said,
[4171.06 → 4175.28] and they conclude that what he means is that the world will end quickly.
[4176.08 → 4179.02] Sometimes people will say, then, look, it didn't end quickly.
[4179.22 → 4181.98] It's been 2,000 years, and therefore Paul's wrong,
[4182.06 → 4183.52] and so then we don't have to listen to him anymore.
[4184.10 → 4185.18] But that's not right.
[4185.44 → 4186.56] That's not what he's saying.
[4187.46 → 4190.20] He says salvation is nearer today than yesterday,
[4190.50 → 4193.00] and it will be nearer tomorrow than today.
[4193.00 → 4197.64] And in spiritual terms, right, it is nearly over,
[4197.72 → 4200.44] because we're in Act 5, not in Act 1.
[4203.88 → 4204.44] Right?
[4204.62 → 4206.98] Act 6 is eternal.
[4207.88 → 4208.94] It's forever.
[4209.94 → 4217.36] And our calling, then, is to live with one foot in the already of Act 6.
[4217.36 → 4220.64] Because Jesus is raised,
[4220.74 → 4224.36] he's already exalted to the right hand of God the Father.
[4224.48 → 4225.76] Because Jesus is raised,
[4225.90 → 4228.98] sin and death and the devil have already been defeated.
[4229.32 → 4231.46] All that remains is for them to be destroyed.
[4232.90 → 4235.74] And living in that truth right now
[4235.74 → 4237.32] is the answer to the question,
[4237.40 → 4238.14] what time is it?
[4238.14 → 4247.36] If, in fact, Act 6 is eternal,
[4248.14 → 4251.06] we ought to then already now
[4251.06 → 4255.28] be building our lives on things that are eternal.
[4256.18 → 4256.50] Right?
[4256.52 → 4260.10] On God and on his truth and love and righteousness.
[4260.96 → 4261.06] Right?
[4261.08 → 4262.96] And in Colossians 3, we read,
[4262.96 → 4265.62] Since then you have been raised with Christ.
[4265.62 → 4267.60] Set your heart on things above,
[4267.76 → 4268.76] where Christ is,
[4269.12 → 4270.60] seated at the right hand of God.
[4270.74 → 4272.42] Set your mind on things above,
[4272.62 → 4274.28] not on earthly things.
[4275.88 → 4277.50] Knowing what time it is
[4277.50 → 4279.14] leads us to,
[4279.48 → 4280.98] Paul says in verse 12,
[4281.46 → 4284.64] Put on the armour of light.
[4285.60 → 4287.14] Putting on the armour of light means
[4287.14 → 4289.28] we behave decently as in the daytime.
[4290.36 → 4291.68] And Tim Keller says that
[4291.68 → 4293.16] learning how to do this
[4293.16 → 4296.06] takes imagination and reflection.
[4297.06 → 4298.12] N.T. Wright says that
[4298.12 → 4300.44] it takes innovation and consistency.
[4301.30 → 4304.34] Mark Glanville, who's a scholar at Regent,
[4304.58 → 4307.52] says that it takes improvisation and tradition.
[4308.66 → 4310.66] But I want you to notice those themes, right?
[4311.22 → 4312.62] Imagination and reflection.
[4312.62 → 4314.62] It takes looking forward creatively
[4314.62 → 4316.66] and reflecting on,
[4316.74 → 4317.64] looking back on,
[4317.64 → 4319.26] the practices of old.
[4319.26 → 4321.90] It takes innovation, right?
[4321.96 → 4323.58] That's the new way of being.
[4323.78 → 4325.16] And it takes consistency.
[4325.16 → 4327.24] That's maintaining and holding true.
[4327.68 → 4329.30] It takes improvisation.
[4329.44 → 4331.74] That's creative license and thinking
[4331.74 → 4332.74] and experimentation.
[4332.74 → 4334.30] That's doing new things
[4334.30 → 4336.16] in new ways in the world.
[4336.24 → 4337.78] And it takes tradition.
[4338.96 → 4340.88] It takes being rooted in something bigger
[4340.88 → 4342.74] and greater and beyond yourself.
[4342.92 → 4344.16] Something rooted in history.
[4344.60 → 4347.40] Rooted in a story that started long before you
[4347.40 → 4350.98] and will go on forever into eternity.
[4351.70 → 4353.06] The call of the Christian,
[4353.40 → 4354.04] hear this,
[4354.12 → 4358.30] is to be both creative and established.
[4358.58 → 4360.58] To be both new and experimenting
[4360.58 → 4361.66] and rooted.
[4362.12 → 4363.72] To be at the same time
[4363.72 → 4365.72] living with a liberality.
[4366.02 → 4367.18] Yes, even for you,
[4367.26 → 4368.10] a liberalism.
[4369.06 → 4371.04] And a conservatism.
[4371.44 → 4373.20] A conservatism and conserving,
[4373.34 → 4375.18] hanging on to what is good and holy.
[4375.18 → 4379.16] If Jesus is the light of the world,
[4379.28 → 4380.28] come from the Father,
[4380.40 → 4382.08] full of grace and truth,
[4382.20 → 4386.78] we also are to be full of grace and truth.
[4386.88 → 4388.50] It is not either or.
[4388.64 → 4389.08] It is not,
[4389.32 → 4391.12] we're going to emphasize grace today
[4391.12 → 4392.14] and truth tomorrow.
[4392.30 → 4394.44] It is both simultaneously,
[4394.90 → 4395.72] in full measure,
[4396.32 → 4396.70] always.
[4396.70 → 4402.14] And now,
[4402.70 → 4405.14] as I hear this,
[4405.20 → 4405.94] let me be really,
[4406.06 → 4407.64] really clear.
[4408.92 → 4410.62] Because putting on the army,
[4410.96 → 4412.16] the armour of light,
[4412.26 → 4413.60] putting on the armour of light,
[4413.82 → 4417.60] means more than being a good person.
[4419.16 → 4420.90] To put on the armour of light
[4420.90 → 4423.68] means to be a Christ-entered,
[4424.28 → 4425.70] Jesus-exalting person.
[4425.70 → 4428.04] And that Christ-entered person
[4428.04 → 4429.44] is so much more
[4429.44 → 4431.74] than a good moral person.
[4431.88 → 4433.12] A Christ-entered person
[4433.12 → 4435.70] confuses people around them
[4435.70 → 4437.96] because even as there is no compromise
[4437.96 → 4439.60] or emotional fusion,
[4439.96 → 4442.06] even as there is no softening of the truth,
[4442.26 → 4442.94] there is,
[4443.06 → 4444.30] with that hand in glove,
[4444.40 → 4445.18] right along with it,
[4445.38 → 4447.10] a kind of love that embraces
[4447.10 → 4449.08] lepers and prostitutes
[4449.08 → 4450.26] and homeless people.
[4451.40 → 4453.28] Being a Christ-entered person
[4453.28 → 4455.32] sacrifices your desires
[4455.32 → 4456.80] on the altar of obedience
[4456.80 → 4459.28] to him as a way of
[4459.28 → 4462.12] exalting Christ as king.
[4463.40 → 4465.12] A Christ-entered person
[4465.12 → 4466.90] has Jesus living
[4466.90 → 4468.78] right here in the centre
[4468.78 → 4470.32] of your life.
[4470.66 → 4471.24] And so,
[4471.42 → 4473.04] as a Christ-entered person,
[4473.30 → 4474.10] ask yourself,
[4474.30 → 4475.96] if Christ is right here,
[4476.66 → 4477.92] what should I do?
[4477.92 → 4481.50] What should I do at this moment,
[4481.60 → 4482.34] right now?
[4482.44 → 4483.98] Amid life or hardship?
[4484.12 → 4484.52] Take that.
[4484.76 → 4486.30] If Christ is right beside you,
[4486.36 → 4486.48] no,
[4486.70 → 4488.94] since Christ is right beside you,
[4489.62 → 4490.48] what should you do?
[4491.86 → 4494.16] Living in the armour of light
[4494.16 → 4495.46] as children of the light,
[4495.56 → 4498.44] we live with the light of the world
[4498.44 → 4499.64] in us.
[4500.46 → 4500.84] And so,
[4500.92 → 4501.54] ask yourself,
[4501.64 → 4503.24] in the good and the bad,
[4503.40 → 4503.94] ask yourself,
[4504.02 → 4505.74] in the beautiful and the ugly,
[4505.74 → 4506.44] ask yourself,
[4506.80 → 4509.16] what is eternally important
[4509.16 → 4509.90] right now?
[4511.22 → 4512.92] What really matters
[4512.92 → 4514.26] right now?
[4518.98 → 4519.96] And look,
[4521.22 → 4524.66] I get it.
[4524.66 → 4527.14] because I know that
[4527.14 → 4529.48] some of you
[4529.48 → 4531.98] are hearing this
[4531.98 → 4534.02] and you're coming into this
[4534.02 → 4536.14] feeling defeated
[4536.14 → 4537.86] or overwhelmed.
[4538.82 → 4539.84] Coming into this saying,
[4539.92 → 4541.62] I just can't do it.
[4542.32 → 4543.88] The problem is too big.
[4544.52 → 4545.88] The addiction is too deep.
[4545.88 → 4547.82] The hold that this thing has on me
[4547.82 → 4548.66] is too strong.
[4548.82 → 4550.20] The power that it has over me
[4550.20 → 4550.90] is too great.
[4551.08 → 4552.28] I just can't do it.
[4552.28 → 4554.60] This habit is far too ingrained
[4554.60 → 4555.94] in my every moment
[4555.94 → 4556.92] of every day
[4556.92 → 4558.38] and I can't break it.
[4558.66 → 4558.72] And
[4558.72 → 4561.22] I get it.
[4561.52 → 4562.20] I get it.
[4562.20 → 4563.18] More than you know,
[4563.84 → 4564.92] more than I'm comfortable
[4564.92 → 4565.72] to say up here
[4565.72 → 4566.64] because we're live-streaming
[4566.64 → 4567.56] and I don't want the rest
[4567.56 → 4568.40] of the world to hear it
[4568.40 → 4569.08] for all eternity.
[4569.60 → 4570.54] I get it.
[4572.58 → 4573.48] I get it.
[4576.54 → 4577.94] And if you're feeling that,
[4577.94 → 4581.92] if that's your story
[4581.92 → 4583.28] right now,
[4584.10 → 4585.30] I want to preach
[4585.30 → 4586.10] right to you.
[4587.06 → 4587.50] I want to speak
[4587.50 → 4589.30] right to your heart.
[4591.14 → 4592.72] Clothe yourselves
[4592.72 → 4595.64] with Christ.
[4597.22 → 4598.50] Clothe yourselves
[4598.50 → 4600.14] with Christ.
[4600.32 → 4601.22] Put on Christ
[4601.22 → 4603.04] because He can do it.
[4603.28 → 4604.78] Any righteous work
[4604.78 → 4606.38] that happens in your life
[4606.38 → 4607.64] is through Him
[4607.64 → 4609.10] already doing it.
[4610.18 → 4611.10] That's what it means
[4611.10 → 4612.48] to be raised with Him.
[4612.82 → 4614.02] That to be a new creation,
[4614.18 → 4615.16] to be born again,
[4615.28 → 4615.98] to be saved,
[4616.26 → 4617.22] be being saved,
[4617.36 → 4618.52] and will be saved.
[4618.60 → 4619.54] That's what this means.
[4619.98 → 4621.22] And when you say,
[4621.62 → 4622.50] I can't stop,
[4622.60 → 4623.34] when you say,
[4623.46 → 4624.50] I can't face that,
[4624.82 → 4626.40] if you are a Christian,
[4626.76 → 4628.16] what you're actually saying
[4628.16 → 4630.08] is Christ can't do that.
[4630.80 → 4632.12] Christ can't stop that.
[4632.40 → 4633.78] Christ can't face that.
[4634.06 → 4635.08] Christ can't change it.
[4635.08 → 4636.54] Because you are clothed
[4636.54 → 4637.04] with Him.
[4638.64 → 4640.16] And it's just not true
[4640.16 → 4642.14] that He can't do that
[4642.14 → 4642.98] because He's done it.
[4643.14 → 4644.06] It's just not true
[4644.06 → 4644.98] that He can't face that
[4644.98 → 4646.00] because He already has.
[4646.14 → 4647.06] It's just not true
[4647.06 → 4648.18] that He doesn't understand
[4648.18 → 4648.76] what you're feeling
[4648.76 → 4650.28] because He's already felt it
[4650.28 → 4651.92] in the depths of His being.
[4651.92 → 4659.76] Guys and girls,
[4660.10 → 4661.78] brothers and sisters,
[4662.58 → 4665.04] some of you here this morning
[4665.04 → 4667.38] are seriously underestimating
[4667.38 → 4670.46] the power of Christ in you.
[4672.46 → 4673.84] Some of you here this morning
[4673.84 → 4675.40] are seriously underestimating
[4675.40 → 4676.52] what He can do
[4676.52 → 4677.98] because He's already done it.
[4677.98 → 4680.76] Christ who came into this world
[4680.76 → 4681.66] and lived the life
[4681.66 → 4682.34] you should have lived
[4682.34 → 4683.22] obeying perfectly
[4683.22 → 4684.42] the demands of the law
[4684.42 → 4685.20] for you.
[4685.70 → 4687.22] Christ who came into this world
[4687.22 → 4688.10] and died the death
[4688.10 → 4689.12] that you deserved
[4689.12 → 4690.80] bearing God's wrath for sin,
[4691.12 → 4692.14] taking on the punishment
[4692.14 → 4693.66] that belonged to you.
[4694.22 → 4696.42] And now if you are united to Him,
[4696.70 → 4697.88] you are being transformed
[4697.88 → 4699.12] and have been transformed
[4699.12 → 4700.90] into His image.
[4701.24 → 4702.88] Christ has changed you.
[4703.16 → 4704.70] He has made you new.
[4704.70 → 4706.94] And Christ is changing you.
[4707.08 → 4708.64] And He is making you new.
[4708.82 → 4710.52] And Christ will change you.
[4710.64 → 4712.14] And He will make you new.
[4712.42 → 4713.88] This is what it is
[4713.88 → 4716.30] to clothe yourselves with Christ.
[4716.54 → 4717.86] You are putting on
[4717.86 → 4719.30] the armour of God.
[4719.38 → 4720.22] You are putting on
[4720.22 → 4721.96] the power of God.
[4723.06 → 4724.68] These are battle clothes
[4724.68 → 4725.76] that you're wearing.
[4726.10 → 4727.38] That's what time it is.
[4728.48 → 4729.46] And it's time for you
[4729.46 → 4730.38] to wage war
[4730.38 → 4731.92] against sin in your life
[4731.92 → 4733.84] with one foot in this world
[4733.84 → 4735.80] and one foot in the world to come.
[4736.16 → 4737.80] You are messengers,
[4738.26 → 4740.04] ambassadors of God's reconciliation
[4740.04 → 4741.38] as though He were making
[4741.38 → 4743.02] His appeal through you.
[4743.30 → 4744.62] You are soldiers
[4744.62 → 4746.46] of the one to come.
[4746.88 → 4748.02] Clothe yourselves
[4748.02 → 4749.58] with Christ.
[4749.58 → 4756.72] When you see a man
[4756.72 → 4757.34] and a woman
[4757.34 → 4760.52] dressed in a tuxedo
[4760.52 → 4762.00] and a ball gown,
[4763.00 → 4764.38] you've got a pretty good idea
[4764.38 → 4764.96] of what they're doing
[4764.96 → 4765.60] and where they're going.
[4766.90 → 4767.88] And dressing that way
[4767.88 → 4768.46] has an effect
[4768.46 → 4769.08] on your behaviour.
[4770.04 → 4772.02] When you wear your soft pink pants
[4772.02 → 4773.10] and blue suede shoes,
[4773.88 → 4775.42] you know you look good.
[4776.86 → 4777.18] Right?
[4777.18 → 4777.76] When you put on
[4777.76 → 4779.12] that fancy colourful tie
[4779.12 → 4780.14] and come to church,
[4780.20 → 4781.08] you know you look good.
[4782.46 → 4782.86] Right?
[4782.88 → 4783.90] When you get a brand new
[4783.90 → 4785.40] bright red baseball jersey
[4785.40 → 4786.62] and brand new shiny
[4786.62 → 4787.86] crispy white pants
[4787.86 → 4789.00] and brand new
[4789.00 → 4790.10] white and red cleats,
[4790.30 → 4791.58] you know you look good.
[4793.90 → 4794.86] But if you put on
[4794.86 → 4795.62] your tuxedo
[4795.62 → 4796.52] or your ball gown
[4796.52 → 4797.26] and then you go stand
[4797.26 → 4798.08] in the batter's box,
[4799.02 → 4800.02] you look silly.
[4803.64 → 4804.58] You look a fool.
[4804.58 → 4809.02] Remember who you are wearing.
[4811.10 → 4812.98] Remember how that changes
[4812.98 → 4814.78] how you show up in the world
[4814.78 → 4817.08] and what you are called to do
[4817.08 → 4819.08] and how you are called to be.
[4819.26 → 4822.72] Remember that he is with you.
[4823.66 → 4825.62] He is in you.
[4826.38 → 4828.72] This is the true story
[4828.72 → 4830.14] of the whole world
[4830.14 → 4832.46] and finding your place in it
[4832.46 → 4835.06] means knowing what time it is.
[4835.34 → 4837.04] And this is the time.
[4837.28 → 4838.52] The night is nearly over.
[4838.62 → 4840.60] It is time to wake up.
[4840.72 → 4842.12] The day is coming.
[4842.24 → 4843.34] It's time to put away
[4843.34 → 4844.36] the deeds of darkness
[4844.36 → 4845.10] and to put on
[4845.10 → 4846.26] the armour of light.
[4846.42 → 4847.40] Clothe yourselves
[4847.40 → 4848.52] with Christ.
[4848.78 → 4849.34] And then,
[4849.48 → 4850.54] whether he tarries
[4850.54 → 4851.26] another day
[4851.26 → 4852.72] or another 2,000 years,
[4852.98 → 4854.72] the day will still be closer
[4854.72 → 4856.44] and the world
[4856.44 → 4858.26] will have seen its Saviour
[4858.26 → 4861.26] because they have seen you.
[4863.84 → 4865.36] When you put on Christ,
[4865.66 → 4867.34] you display to the world
[4867.34 → 4870.20] who their Saviour is.
[4871.18 → 4872.90] Understanding what time it is
[4872.90 → 4874.16] helps us to know
[4874.16 → 4875.86] how we are to live in the world
[4875.86 → 4877.40] and towards what goal
[4877.40 → 4878.30] we are moving.
[4878.68 → 4880.24] And we live as those
[4880.24 → 4881.98] who have Christ living in us.
[4882.06 → 4883.48] We live in the power
[4883.48 → 4885.02] and the victory of that truth.
[4885.02 → 4886.74] And we live as those
[4886.74 → 4888.30] who know what is coming.
[4888.72 → 4889.58] We live as those
[4889.58 → 4891.78] who know what is eternally valuable.
[4892.06 → 4893.34] We live with imagination
[4893.34 → 4894.72] and reflection,
[4894.94 → 4896.60] with innovation and consistency,
[4896.98 → 4899.28] with improvisation and tradition.
[4899.80 → 4904.80] We live because Christ lives in us.
[4905.14 → 4907.46] And that is when you say amen.
[4908.38 → 4909.68] You can do better than that.
[4910.34 → 4910.60] Amen?
[4911.02 → 4911.56] Amen.
[4912.02 → 4912.52] God bless.
[4912.52 → 4914.02] Let's pray together.
[4915.02 → 4915.52] Amen.
[4922.04 → 4923.74] Holy, holy God,
[4924.48 → 4927.06] open our eyes to the truth
[4927.06 → 4930.00] of what time it is.
[4930.90 → 4933.34] Open our eyes to the truth
[4933.34 → 4936.72] of your nearness in Jesus Christ.
[4936.98 → 4939.60] Open our eyes to the glory
[4939.60 → 4941.06] and the magnitude
[4941.06 → 4943.06] of who you are
[4943.06 → 4944.62] and what you are doing.
[4945.02 → 4945.94] in him
[4945.94 → 4948.20] and in us.
[4951.20 → 4953.46] Even as we are transformed
[4953.46 → 4955.24] from one degree of glory
[4955.24 → 4956.44] to another,
[4957.08 → 4959.30] may we reveal Christ
[4959.30 → 4960.32] to the world.
[4961.58 → 4963.12] And so we pray,
[4963.30 → 4963.76] Lord God,
[4964.30 → 4965.48] help us to know
[4965.48 → 4966.62] what time it is
[4966.62 → 4968.62] that we might live
[4968.62 → 4969.64] in this world
[4969.64 → 4970.72] revealing you
[4970.72 → 4972.90] to people in need.
[4972.90 → 4974.22] God,
[4974.28 → 4975.12] you have given us
[4975.12 → 4976.90] answer to this meaning crisis
[4976.90 → 4979.06] and it is your story.
[4979.58 → 4980.94] And you have made your story
[4980.94 → 4982.16] our story.
[4982.34 → 4984.12] And so in this truth
[4984.12 → 4985.16] we live.
[4985.36 → 4986.68] May we live then
[4986.68 → 4988.64] as those clothed
[4988.64 → 4990.36] with Christ.
[4991.22 → 4992.24] In the beauty
[4992.24 → 4993.84] and majesty
[4993.84 → 4995.50] of your name we pray.
[4995.50 → 4995.66] Amen.
[4995.66 → 4996.82] Amen.
[4996.82 → 4996.88] Amen.
[5001.84 → 5002.96] Now we know
[5002.96 → 5004.64] that living
[5004.64 → 5005.42] in the beauty
[5005.42 → 5006.08] and majesty
[5006.08 → 5006.92] of Christ
[5006.92 → 5008.84] isn't always
[5008.84 → 5010.52] the easiest task
[5010.52 → 5011.42] and we know
[5011.42 → 5012.44] that we need
[5012.44 → 5013.36] to be sustained
[5013.36 → 5014.24] for that journey
[5014.24 → 5015.04] and so we are going
[5015.04 → 5015.48] to come
[5015.48 → 5016.88] to the Lord's table
[5016.88 → 5018.04] so that
[5018.04 → 5019.16] even as Christ
[5019.16 → 5020.12] promises us
[5020.12 → 5020.86] in his word
[5020.86 → 5022.24] that he has met us here
[5022.24 → 5023.42] and is transforming us,
[5023.42 → 5025.34] we might take that promise
[5025.34 → 5026.26] and taste
[5026.26 → 5027.48] and see
[5027.48 → 5028.70] its truth.
[5029.56 → 5030.96] That you might take in
[5030.96 → 5032.02] Jesus Christ
[5032.02 → 5032.60] in the bread
[5032.60 → 5033.62] and in the juice
[5033.62 → 5035.30] and so be transformed
[5035.30 → 5037.42] into his image.
[5037.58 → 5038.78] As we come to the table
[5038.78 → 5040.28] we have a bit of liturgy
[5040.28 → 5040.64] together
[5040.64 → 5041.58] that we will move through.
[5041.72 → 5042.58] I invite you to
[5042.58 → 5043.66] say the parts
[5043.66 → 5044.42] for you spoken
[5044.42 → 5045.74] on the screen behind.
[5046.40 → 5047.66] Lift your hearts.
[5048.40 → 5049.38] Lift your hearts
[5049.38 → 5049.94] to the Lord.
[5050.44 → 5051.60] Let us give thanks
[5051.60 → 5052.72] to the Lord our God.
[5052.72 → 5054.04] It is right
[5054.04 → 5055.34] for us to give thanks.
[5055.80 → 5056.64] Let's pray together.
[5058.16 → 5059.10] With joy
[5059.10 → 5060.26] we praise you
[5060.26 → 5061.36] gracious God
[5061.36 → 5063.04] for you have created
[5063.04 → 5064.34] heaven and earth.
[5064.46 → 5065.14] You have made us
[5065.14 → 5065.88] in your image
[5065.88 → 5066.80] and you have kept
[5066.80 → 5067.88] covenant with us
[5067.88 → 5069.44] even when we fell
[5069.44 → 5070.08] into sin.
[5071.04 → 5072.34] We give you thanks
[5072.34 → 5073.26] Jesus Christ
[5073.26 → 5073.70] who
[5073.70 → 5075.26] for Jesus Christ
[5075.26 → 5076.72] who by his life
[5076.72 → 5077.88] death and resurrection
[5077.88 → 5079.20] opened to us
[5079.20 → 5079.82] the way
[5079.82 → 5080.74] of life
[5080.74 → 5081.66] everlasting.
[5081.66 → 5082.70] Amen.
[5084.70 → 5085.96] Our Lord Jesus
[5085.96 → 5087.66] before he suffered
[5087.66 → 5088.48] gave us
[5088.48 → 5089.68] this memorial
[5089.68 → 5090.98] of his
[5090.98 → 5091.98] sacrifice
[5091.98 → 5092.94] until he comes
[5092.94 → 5093.28] again.
[5094.16 → 5095.16] The Lord Jesus
[5095.16 → 5096.86] on the night
[5096.86 → 5097.96] that he was
[5097.96 → 5098.40] betrayed
[5098.40 → 5099.44] took bread
[5099.44 → 5101.26] and when he
[5101.26 → 5102.12] had given thanks
[5102.12 → 5103.12] he broke it
[5103.12 → 5103.58] and said
[5103.58 → 5105.14] this is my body
[5105.14 → 5106.50] which is for you.
[5106.98 → 5107.70] Do this
[5107.70 → 5108.48] in remembrance
[5108.48 → 5108.62] remembrance
[5108.62 → 5109.48] of me.
[5111.48 → 5112.46] And in the same
[5112.46 → 5112.86] way
[5112.86 → 5114.10] he took the cup
[5114.10 → 5115.10] after supper
[5115.10 → 5115.72] saying
[5115.72 → 5116.78] this cup
[5116.78 → 5117.56] is the new
[5117.56 → 5117.96] covenant
[5117.96 → 5118.98] in my blood.
[5119.62 → 5120.24] Do this
[5120.24 → 5121.12] whenever you
[5121.12 → 5121.76] drink it
[5121.76 → 5122.56] in remembrance
[5122.56 → 5123.90] of me.
[5124.72 → 5125.38] For whenever
[5125.38 → 5126.40] you eat
[5126.40 → 5127.26] this bread
[5127.26 → 5128.02] and drink
[5128.02 → 5128.84] this cup
[5128.84 → 5129.84] you proclaim
[5129.84 → 5130.60] the Lord's
[5130.60 → 5130.88] death
[5130.88 → 5131.54] until
[5131.54 → 5132.60] he comes
[5132.60 → 5133.16] again.
[5133.16 → 5135.14] this is the
[5135.14 → 5135.70] mystery
[5135.70 → 5136.54] of our
[5136.54 → 5136.92] faith.
[5138.12 → 5139.18] Your death
[5139.18 → 5139.88] oh Christ
[5139.88 → 5140.68] we proclaim
[5140.68 → 5142.38] your resurrection
[5142.38 → 5143.30] we affirm
[5143.30 → 5143.98] with joy
[5143.98 → 5145.26] you're coming
[5145.26 → 5146.12] we await
[5146.12 → 5146.74] with hope.
[5147.20 → 5148.64] Glory be to you
[5148.64 → 5149.46] Lord Jesus.
[5150.62 → 5151.56] Church family
[5151.56 → 5151.98] the Lord
[5151.98 → 5152.78] has prepared
[5152.78 → 5153.66] his table
[5153.66 → 5154.20] for all
[5154.20 → 5154.74] who love
[5154.74 → 5155.04] him
[5155.04 → 5155.48] for all
[5155.48 → 5156.40] who trust
[5156.40 → 5156.88] in him
[5156.88 → 5157.34] alone
[5157.34 → 5157.82] for their
[5157.82 → 5158.30] salvation.
[5158.30 → 5159.50] and so
[5159.50 → 5160.16] come to
[5160.16 → 5160.82] this table
[5160.82 → 5161.52] you who
[5161.52 → 5162.22] have much
[5162.22 → 5162.58] faith
[5162.58 → 5163.30] and you
[5163.30 → 5163.60] who would
[5163.60 → 5163.94] like to
[5163.94 → 5164.40] have more.
[5164.94 → 5165.44] Come to
[5165.44 → 5166.34] this table
[5166.34 → 5167.20] you who
[5167.20 → 5167.60] have been
[5167.60 → 5167.98] to this
[5167.98 → 5168.34] sacrament
[5168.34 → 5168.74] often
[5168.74 → 5169.26] and you
[5169.26 → 5169.64] who have
[5169.64 → 5170.14] not been
[5170.14 → 5170.58] for a
[5170.58 → 5171.12] long time.
[5171.46 → 5171.80] Come to
[5171.80 → 5172.26] this table
[5172.26 → 5172.80] you who
[5172.80 → 5173.30] have tried
[5173.30 → 5173.84] to follow
[5173.84 → 5174.24] Jesus
[5174.24 → 5175.24] and you
[5175.24 → 5175.70] who have
[5175.70 → 5176.04] failed.
[5176.82 → 5177.34] Come to
[5177.34 → 5177.92] this table
[5177.92 → 5178.90] because Christ
[5178.90 → 5180.36] is raised.
[5180.94 → 5181.52] Come if
[5181.52 → 5182.16] you are here
[5182.16 → 5182.82] or if you
[5182.82 → 5183.48] are at home
[5183.48 → 5184.08] online
[5184.08 → 5185.02] joining us
[5185.02 → 5185.48] come
[5185.48 → 5186.18] because it
[5186.18 → 5186.84] is Christ
[5186.84 → 5187.64] who invites
[5187.64 → 5188.14] us to
[5188.14 → 5189.22] meet us
[5189.22 → 5189.82] here.
[5190.48 → 5190.90] The gifts
[5190.90 → 5191.44] of God
[5191.44 → 5192.26] for the
[5192.26 → 5192.60] people
[5192.60 → 5193.58] of God.
[5194.96 → 5195.70] This morning
[5195.70 → 5196.06] as we
[5196.06 → 5196.48] come to
[5196.48 → 5196.96] the table
[5196.96 → 5197.90] we are
[5197.90 → 5198.16] going to
[5198.16 → 5198.48] do so
[5198.48 → 5198.68] in a
[5198.68 → 5198.92] little bit
[5198.92 → 5199.12] of a

[5743.82 → 5750.96] Praise and honour out to Thee
[5750.96 → 5757.12] Now my debt is paid
[5757.12 → 5759.94] It is paid in fall
[5759.94 → 5762.88] By the precious blood
[5762.88 → 5765.74] That my Jesus filled
[5765.74 → 5768.66] Now the curse of sin
[5768.66 → 5771.54] Has no hold on me
[5771.54 → 5774.44] Whom the Son so sweet
[5774.44 → 5777.20] Oh, it's free indeed

[5785.86 → 5788.74] That my Jesus filled
[5788.74 → 5791.42] Now the curse of sin
[5791.42 → 5794.32] Has no hold on me
[5794.32 → 5797.24] Whom the Son so sweet
[5797.24 → 5799.94] Oh, it's free indeed
[5799.94 → 5805.44] All thy holy ones for salvation
[5805.44 → 5811.06] For your love poured out over me
[5811.06 → 5816.32] All my soul cries of hallelujah
[5816.32 → 5822.14] Praise and honour unto thee
[5822.14 → 5831.08] See the stone is rolled away
[5831.08 → 5836.60] Behold the empty tomb
[5836.60 → 5842.12] Hallelujah, God keep us
[5842.12 → 5847.02] He's risen from the grave
[5847.02 → 5852.20] All thy prophet thrones my salvation
[5852.20 → 5857.80] May your love poured out over me
[5857.80 → 5862.98] All my soul cries of hallelujah

[5868.38 → 5874.02] Praise and honour unto thee
[5877.02 → 5892.18] As you go, go as those clothed with Christ
[5892.18 → 5896.26] Go as those who have been met by him in our worship together
[5896.26 → 5899.30] Who have heard his voice in his word
[5899.30 → 5902.96] And have now sent us out in the power of his name
[5902.96 → 5905.12] With the equipping of the Holy Spirit
[5905.12 → 5908.00] Go because God goes with you
[5908.00 → 5910.26] Go with a few invitations
[5910.26 → 5912.44] First to hang out at the back
[5912.44 → 5914.10] And to fellowship together
[5914.10 → 5915.96] Sharing how you have met God
[5915.96 → 5917.50] Or maybe where you need God

[5930.14 → 5933.40] And go also with an invitation
[5933.40 → 5935.28] If you'd like to grab me at the back

[5936.70 → 5937.88] Or profession of faith
[5937.88 → 5938.54] Or baptism
[5938.54 → 5940.38] Or what that might look like
[5940.38 → 5942.26] In your story of faith
[5942.26 → 5943.74] I'd love to meet you there
[5943.74 → 5945.08] And then lastly
[5945.08 → 5948.12] Go as those who for the month of April
[5948.12 → 5949.58] Are celebrating treat tag

[5974.84 → 5976.46] God go beneath you
[5976.46 → 5977.46] To support you
[5977.46 → 5979.38] And God go beside you
[5979.38 → 5980.50] To befriend you
[5980.50 → 5982.82] Do not be afraid
[5982.82 → 5984.36] Let the blessing of God

[5985.30 → 5987.06] Do not be afraid
[5987.06 → 5989.52] But go in peace
