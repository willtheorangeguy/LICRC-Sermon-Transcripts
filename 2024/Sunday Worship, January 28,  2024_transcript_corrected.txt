[782.74 → 783.74] In this I will rejoice.
[783.74 → 784.62] Good morning, everyone.
[785.10 → 785.78] Good morning.
[786.30 → 789.34] Welcome to Langley, Emanuel CRC this morning.
[789.44 → 791.88] My name is Kevin Lover, and I am the youth pastor here.
[792.26 → 794.68] And it's so good to see you here this morning.
[795.36 → 798.10] Today we've got an exciting day ahead of us.
[798.18 → 802.20] We have another baptism happening in our church today, the baptism of little Ava Rose.
[802.34 → 807.06] And so if you're visiting and are here for that purpose, extra greetings to you today.
[807.52 → 812.02] And if you're a visitor here just joining us, checking us out for the first time, we
[812.02 → 812.72] welcome you as well.
[812.72 → 813.90] Please stick around after the service.
[814.00 → 815.78] We'll have some coffee and refreshments afterwards.
[816.04 → 820.18] And if you're interested in connecting with myself or Pastor Chris or one of the other
[820.18 → 824.24] staff here, there should be some cards in the back of the seats there you can fill out or
[824.24 → 826.86] you can come and find us at the Connect booth after the service.
[827.64 → 829.30] A few announcements this morning.
[829.64 → 834.84] In February, we are participating once again in an event called Coldest Night of the Year.
[835.26 → 838.90] There's going to be some more information coming out later this week in the bulletin and then
[838.90 → 840.26] also next Sunday as well.
[840.26 → 845.74] But essentially on February 24th, we will be joining a whole host of people from Langley
[845.74 → 847.90] and going for a walk together.
[848.16 → 854.64] And before that, raising money for the Gateway of Hope, which is a shelter for those who are
[854.64 → 858.26] unhoused in the area and in need of help.
[858.36 → 862.54] And so if that's something that you are interested in joining, please do consider doing that.
[862.60 → 865.24] More information is going to be coming out, like I said, in the bulletin this week.
[865.24 → 870.44] Or you can talk to me or my wife Nikki, who's not here today, or one of the staff here at
[870.44 → 871.02] the church as well.
[871.06 → 874.96] We'd love to see a team of you join us for that walk on February 24th.
[875.66 → 880.56] Next week, Saturday, we are participating in leading a worship service at Sun ridge Gardens
[880.56 → 881.42] just up the hill.
[881.50 → 885.68] It's a really great time to join together with some of the senior members who live there in
[885.68 → 887.20] our church, but also as a church community.
[887.52 → 889.44] If you're interested in coming to that, please do join us.
[889.48 → 892.02] That'll be Saturday, this coming Saturday at 2 p.m.
[892.02 → 894.16] And then finally, some ministry things.
[894.60 → 898.00] Youth, we have HCBC today, but it is at an unusual time.
[898.08 → 900.12] We are going to meet right after the service this morning.
[900.22 → 902.00] We will run that from noon until 1.
[902.42 → 904.12] So I have a little snack lunch for you.
[904.54 → 908.98] We will manage just fine, and we will do HCBC today from noon until 1.
[909.26 → 913.56] And we're doing it at that time because tonight, all the church, you're all enjoyed it, to
[913.56 → 917.64] join us for a worship service tonight here at 6 p.m.
[917.64 → 922.14] as we participate in an event we are calling Worship Through the Decades.
[922.56 → 925.26] And so it'll be an evening of worship starting at 6 p.m.
[925.26 → 926.36] Please come join us for that.
[926.78 → 927.94] Invite your friends, invite your neighbours.
[928.04 → 928.96] It should be a lovely time.
[929.42 → 932.92] And finally, if you look around, and you're asking yourself, where are some of the boys?
[933.56 → 937.04] Cadet Sunday is happening today at Living Hope CRC in Abbotsford.
[937.12 → 942.48] And so that's where a number of our cadet leaders and our young cadets are at today as well.
[942.92 → 945.72] So that is the run-through of the announcements today.
[945.72 → 950.20] I am now going to invite up Pastor Chris, and he is going to lead us in God's opening blessing.
[953.90 → 955.56] Good morning, everyone.
[959.26 → 966.62] So later on in our sermon, I'm going to invite some voluntary participation on your behalf.
[966.86 → 968.64] So just remember that.
[968.90 → 971.46] Do better than what you just did when I said good morning.
[972.36 → 973.14] Good morning.
[973.50 → 973.90] Good morning.
[974.34 → 975.12] Thank you.
[975.12 → 976.32] Welcome to worship.
[976.64 → 978.64] We are excited to gather and worship our God.
[978.72 → 985.48] And so I'm going to invite you to stand if you are able to receive God's greeting, because he is in this place.
[985.64 → 990.44] Our worship is centred around him, and he invites us to himself.
[990.84 → 992.84] And so we receive his greeting.
[992.96 → 994.98] Receive the greeting of our God.
[994.98 → 999.14] Grace, mercy, and peace to you.
[999.14 → 1006.50] From God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Saviour, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[1007.50 → 1008.02] Amen.
[1008.02 → 1009.74] Let's worship God this morning.
[1009.74 → 1009.82] Amen.
[1009.82 → 1010.34] Let's worship God this morning.
[1010.34 → 1017.92] From Psalm 19, we hear,
[1017.92 → 1020.28] The heavens declare the glory of God.
[1020.28 → 1023.06] The skies proclaim the works of his hands.
[1023.52 → 1025.72] Day after day they pour forth speech.
[1025.88 → 1027.84] Night after night they reveal knowledge.
[1028.44 → 1029.48] They have no speech.
[1029.62 → 1030.62] They use no words.
[1031.02 → 1032.48] No sound is heard from them.
[1032.66 → 1035.54] Yet their voice goes out into all the earth.
[1035.66 → 1037.48] Their words to the ends of the world.
[1037.48 → 1042.38] May our voices now join all creation as we declare the glory of God.
[1042.38 → 1043.38] Amen.
[1067.48 → 1072.44] How great, how awesome is he.
[1073.10 → 1075.34] Together we sing.
[1078.22 → 1080.66] Everyone sing.
[1083.34 → 1087.64] Holy is the Lord, God Almighty.
[1089.04 → 1092.88] The earth is filled with its glory.
[1093.54 → 1097.46] Holy is the Lord, God Almighty.
[1097.48 → 1102.90] The earth is filled with His glory
[1102.90 → 1107.88] The earth is filled with His glory
[1107.88 → 1118.60] We stand and lift our hands
[1118.60 → 1123.12] For the joy of the Lord is our strength
[1123.12 → 1129.08] We bow down and worship Him now
[1129.08 → 1133.12] How great, how awesome is He
[1133.12 → 1135.90] Together we sing
[1135.90 → 1142.50] Everyone sing
[1142.50 → 1147.84] Holy is the Lord, the God Almighty
[1147.84 → 1152.90] The earth is filled with His glory
[1152.90 → 1157.86] Holy is the Lord, the God Almighty
[1157.86 → 1162.86] The earth is filled with His glory
[1162.86 → 1167.86] The earth is filled with His glory
[1167.86 → 1171.82] It's rising up
[1171.82 → 1177.82] All around is the anthem of the Lord's renown
[1177.82 → 1181.78] It's rising up
[1181.78 → 1189.74] All around is the anthem of the Lord's renown

[1272.42 → 1286.38] Heavens are your tattered and gold
[1286.38 → 1292.38] Heavens are your tattered and gold
[1292.38 → 1310.34] Glory to the Lord, the Lord Almighty
[1310.34 → 1313.00] He blends Your majesty
[1313.00 → 1320.34] You are holy, holy
[1320.34 → 1325.56] Lord of heaven and earth
[1325.56 → 1332.34] Lord of heaven and earth
[1332.34 → 1337.56] Early in the morning
[1337.56 → 1344.14] I will celebrate the light
[1344.14 → 1349.34] When I stumble in the darkness
[1349.34 → 1356.34] I will call You day by night
[1356.34 → 1360.84] God of waters beyond our galaxy
[1360.84 → 1368.12] You are holy, holy
[1368.12 → 1372.72] You live earth to cleanse Your majesty
[1372.72 → 1380.06] You are holy, holy
[1380.06 → 1385.08] Lord of heaven and earth
[1385.08 → 1391.36] Lord of heaven and earth
[1391.36 → 1394.90] Hallelujah

[1413.64 → 1419.24] You are holy, holy
[1419.24 → 1421.24] Holy, holy
[1421.24 → 1422.24] Holy

[1425.52 → 1431.12] You are holy, holy
[1431.12 → 1433.12] Holy
[1433.12 → 1438.52] Lord of heaven and earth
[1438.52 → 1440.52] Lord of heaven and earth
[1440.52 → 1444.52] Lord of heaven and earth
[1444.52 → 1451.80] Our confession this morning comes from Psalm 19
[1451.80 → 1453.08] Where it says
[1453.08 → 1455.76] The law of the Lord is perfect
[1455.76 → 1457.84] Refreshing the soul
[1457.84 → 1460.98] The statutes of the Lord are trustworthy
[1460.98 → 1463.06] Making wise the simple
[1463.06 → 1466.34] The precepts of the Lord are right
[1466.34 → 1468.04] Giving joy to the heart
[1468.04 → 1471.12] The commands of the Lord are radiant
[1471.12 → 1473.30] Giving light to the eyes
[1473.30 → 1475.78] The fear of the Lord is pure
[1475.78 → 1477.06] Enduring forever
[1477.06 → 1479.86] The decrees of the Lord are firm
[1479.86 → 1482.14] And all of them are righteous
[1482.14 → 1484.92] They are more precious than gold
[1484.92 → 1487.68] More than much more pure gold
[1487.68 → 1489.76] They are sweeter than honey
[1489.76 → 1491.54] Than honey from the honeycomb
[1491.54 → 1494.62] By them your servant is warned
[1494.62 → 1497.54] In keeping them there is great reward
[1497.54 → 1500.86] But who can discern their own errors
[1500.86 → 1503.24] Forgive my hidden faults
[1503.24 → 1506.90] Keep your servant also from wilful sins
[1506.90 → 1509.24] May they not rule over me
[1509.24 → 1511.48] Then I will be blameless
[1511.48 → 1513.94] Innocent of great transgression
[1513.94 → 1516.80] May these words of my mouth
[1516.80 → 1518.78] And this meditation of my heart
[1518.78 → 1520.78] Be pleasing in your sight
[1520.78 → 1523.56] Lord, my rock and my redeemer
[1527.54 → 1535.80] Innocent of great transgression
[1535.80 → 1537.04] There are manynelows
[1537.04 → 1538.36] The 몸 is SEK
[1538.36 → 1540.80] That he is dozen
[1540.80 → 1555.90] May he detox
[1555.90 → 1558.86] We could ever sing
[1558.86 → 1563.32] Worthy of all the praise
[1563.32 → 1565.40] We could ever bring
[1565.40 → 1569.96] Worthy of every wealth
[1569.96 → 1571.68] We could ever bring
[1571.68 → 1573.76] We bid for you
[1573.76 → 1583.74] Jesus, be the brother
[1583.74 → 1585.64] Every other knee
[1585.64 → 1590.58] Jesus, be the only one
[1590.58 → 1592.70] We could ever sing
[1592.70 → 1597.36] Worthy of every wealth
[1597.36 → 1599.08] We could ever bring
[1599.08 → 1601.26] We bid for you
[1601.26 → 1604.80] We bid for you
[1604.80 → 1612.16] Holy, there is no one like you
[1612.16 → 1615.48] There is none beside you
[1615.48 → 1620.14] Open up my eyes in wonder
[1620.14 → 1622.20] And show me
[1622.20 → 1625.50] Who you are and fill me
[1625.50 → 1628.64] With your heart and beating
[1628.64 → 1633.30] Give it in love to those around me
[1633.30 → 1641.96] Jesus, the name of the Lord
[1641.96 → 1653.80] Jesus, the name above every other name
[1653.80 → 1660.52] Jesus, the only one we could ever sing
[1660.52 → 1660.86] We could ever sing
[1660.86 → 1665.18] Worthy of every wealth
[1665.18 → 1666.64] We could ever bring
[1666.64 → 1668.96] We bid for you
[1668.96 → 1671.86] We bid for you
[1671.86 → 1679.52] Holy, there is no one like you
[1679.52 → 1682.92] There is none beside you
[1682.92 → 1683.52] Holy, there is no one like you
[1683.52 → 1685.02] There is none beside you
[1685.02 → 1693.68] Who you are and fill me
[1693.68 → 1696.04] With your heart and beating
[1696.04 → 1701.56] Give your love to those around me
[1701.56 → 1706.22] And I will build my life
[1706.22 → 1731.12] I will build my life
[1731.12 → 1732.12] Upon your love
[1732.12 → 1734.28] Upon your love
[1734.28 → 1738.84] It is a Lord's foundation
[1738.84 → 1739.84] And I will build my life
[1739.84 → 1743.50] And I will build my life
[1743.50 → 1744.12] And I will build my life
[1744.12 → 1746.56] In you alone
[1746.56 → 1752.26] And I will not be shaken
[1752.26 → 1755.72] And I will build my life
[1755.72 → 1759.98] Upon your love
[1759.98 → 1777.98] There is none beside you
[1777.98 → 1789.58] Open up my eyes
[1789.58 → 1790.58] Give your love
[1790.58 → 1791.24] In you alone
[1791.24 → 1793.24] And show me
[1793.24 → 1794.86] Who you are
[1794.86 → 1796.52] And fill me
[1796.52 → 1799.44] With your heart and beating
[1799.44 → 1805.00] Give your love to those around me
[1805.00 → 1816.96] Father, forgive our hidden faults
[1816.96 → 1821.34] And keep us from wilfully sinning against you
[1821.34 → 1825.52] May the words of our mouth
[1825.52 → 1828.46] And the meditations of our heart
[1828.46 → 1829.98] Be pleasing to you, Lord
[1829.98 → 1831.88] My rock and my redeemer
[1831.88 → 1832.84] Amen
[1832.84 → 1833.38] Amen
[1833.38 → 1845.86] Amen
[1845.86 → 1875.84] Great is thy faithfulness, O God,
[1875.84 → 1877.46] my Father.
[1878.40 → 1885.44] There is no shadow of turning with thee.
[1886.08 → 1891.58] Thou changes strong, but thou crushes safe,
[1891.58 → 1893.08] fail not.
[1893.48 → 1900.00] And thou hast seen, thou forever wilt be.
[1900.00 → 1908.00] Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[1908.38 → 1914.48] Morning by morning new mercies I see.
[1914.48 → 1922.02] All I have needed thy hand hath provided.
[1923.12 → 1929.48] Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto thee.
[1929.48 → 1939.66] Summer and winter and springtime and harvest,
[1939.66 → 1946.78] sun, moon, and stars in their courses above.
[1947.18 → 1953.72] Joy with all nature in manifold witness,
[1953.72 → 1961.72] To thy great faithfulness mercy hath come.
[1961.72 → 1969.18] Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[1969.28 → 1975.72] Morning by morning new mercies I see.
[1975.72 → 1982.72] All I have needed thy hand hath provided.
[1982.72 → 1990.72] Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto thee.
[1990.72 → 1991.72] Lord, unto thee.
[1991.72 → 1992.72] Amen.
[1992.72 → 2000.72] Pardon for sin and a peace that endured.
[2000.72 → 2008.18] Thy own dear presence to cheer and to guide.
[2008.18 → 2015.22] Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow.
[2015.22 → 2022.22] Blessings all mine with ten thousand mercies I see.
[2022.22 → 2030.22] Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[2030.22 → 2031.22] Great is thy faithfulness.
[2031.22 → 2037.22] Morning by morning new mercies I see.
[2037.22 → 2044.22] All I have needed thy hand hath provided.
[2044.22 → 2052.22] Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto thee.
[2052.22 → 2056.22] Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto thee.
[2056.22 → 2058.22] Thank you, Jesus.
[2058.22 → 2060.22] Amen.
[2060.22 → 2062.22] Amen.
[2062.22 → 2063.22] Amen.
[2063.22 → 2064.22] Amen.
[2064.22 → 2065.22] Amen.
[2065.22 → 2066.22] Amen.
[2066.22 → 2067.22] Amen.
[2067.22 → 2074.22] This morning, as part of our worship, we get to administer and participate in the
[2074.22 → 2078.22] sacrament of baptism for one of our little children.
[2078.22 → 2084.22] Now, as we come to the sacrament of baptism, let me be clear, we do not believe that the
[2084.22 → 2089.22] water itself cleanses from sin.
[2089.22 → 2095.22] Rather, what we're saying here is that this water symbolizes for us Jesus' life, death,
[2095.22 → 2100.92] and resurrection and the promise of forgiveness by that life death and
[2100.92 → 2110.64] resurrection. This child, Ava, is born with a sinful nature into sin and still
[2110.64 → 2116.52] the promises of God are offered to her for forgiveness and new life by the Holy
[2116.52 → 2124.56] Spirit. So we baptize infants not out of superstition or because we like cute
[2124.56 → 2130.10] babies, we baptize them because they are covenant children and therefore ought to
[2130.10 → 2136.28] be baptized. This idea of covenant is rooted in God's promise to Abraham and
[2136.28 → 2143.94] sealed in the sign of circumcision and in baptism now our triune God seals the
[2143.94 → 2150.32] promise of our adoption as his children making for us a new identity in Jesus
[2150.32 → 2156.90] Christ. And so we baptize in obedience to Christ's command in line with the history
[2156.90 → 2162.18] of the Christian church and the teaching of the Bible throughout God's redemptive
[2162.18 → 2168.62] work from creation until the day Jesus Christ returns. Baptism signifies for us
[2168.62 → 2175.22] the inclusion into the covenant community and symbolizes the cleansing of sin. We
[2175.22 → 2180.26] pray this morning that Ava embraces her covenant privileges, that she will
[2180.26 → 2186.04] acknowledge her Lord all the days of her life, and that we will be used of God to
[2186.04 → 2191.46] grow that faith in her. Dave and Sheila, I'm going to invite you guys up to the front
[2191.46 → 2210.92] with Dawson and Ava. In presenting Ava for baptism, I have two questions that I'm going to ask you,
[2211.08 → 2217.42] and these are the same questions that have been asked of generations of Christians before. Likely,
[2217.42 → 2224.12] your parents were asked these same questions when you both were baptized. Do you believe that your
[2224.12 → 2229.54] children, though sinful by nature, are received by God in Christ as members of his covenant and
[2229.54 → 2236.62] therefore ought to be baptized? And second, do you promise in reliance on the Holy Spirit and with the
[2236.62 → 2243.10] help of the Christian community to do all in your power to instruct Ava and all your children in the
[2243.10 → 2249.12] Christian faith and to lead them by your example into the life of Christian discipleship? Dave and
[2249.12 → 2257.96] Sheila, what is your answer? Amen. We do with God's help. We all need God's help. Our Lord Jesus said,
[2258.10 → 2263.04] let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as
[2263.04 → 2268.58] these. And so as is our practice, if you are a young child here or young at heart, you're invited to
[2268.58 → 2274.70] come up and just have a seat here on the floor so you can see firsthand and close what is happening
[2274.70 → 2284.50] over here. Awesome. Malachi, why don't you just lean right in here, and maybe you'll get in the splash
[2284.50 → 2294.40] zone. So in just a moment, guys, we're going to take this water and pour it over Ava's head. And just
[2294.40 → 2300.96] like many of you probably had a shower or a bath last night in order to come to church, this water
[2300.96 → 2309.40] symbolizes for us how Jesus' blood washes us and makes us clean. This water is one of the ways that
[2309.40 → 2317.44] Jesus writes his name on our foreheads as his covenant children. And so we mark that together in worship.
[2317.44 → 2330.76] Ava Rose Skipper, I baptize you in the name of the Father, in the name of the Son,
[2332.60 → 2335.62] and the name of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[2335.62 → 2335.82] Amen.
[2335.82 → 2335.90] Amen.
[2346.10 → 2349.18] Water was a little colder this morning than it has been in the past.
[2352.94 → 2359.24] As we have participated and witnessed God's action towards us in the sacrament, we now have an
[2359.24 → 2367.68] opportunity to respond to that action of God by also offering a promise on behalf of you representing
[2367.68 → 2373.58] the church family everywhere. And so I'm going to invite you, congregation, to stand. I will ask you
[2373.58 → 2382.52] a question and then invite you to respond with the phrase, we do with God's help. And so do you,
[2382.52 → 2387.28] church family here at Langley, Emanuel, and friends and family who have come in support,
[2387.28 → 2393.64] do you promise to love and encourage and support Dave and Sheila, Dawson, and now Ava,
[2394.20 → 2400.52] by welcoming them into our church family, by teaching the gospel of God's love, and by being
[2400.52 → 2405.88] an example of Christian faith and character, and by giving in strong support of God's family
[2405.88 → 2409.42] in fellowship, prayer, and service? What is your answer?
[2410.06 → 2411.70] We do with God's help.
[2412.22 → 2414.66] Amen. Amen. You may have a seat.
[2417.28 → 2423.94] Amen. I invite you to take advantage of that promise offered to you this morning. May I
[2423.94 → 2426.22] take her for a little walk? Yeah.
[2429.06 → 2430.18] Hi, sweet pea.
[2432.64 → 2434.18] Hey, I know.
[2436.88 → 2442.36] We got to hang out already on Tuesday when Sheila was here for coffee break, so she knows me.
[2442.36 → 2452.68] Today, in baptism, we mark the beginning of what we hope to be a journey of faithful response
[2452.68 → 2461.00] for Ava. And yet, we know that all of us fall short of God's design and God's plan, and so may
[2461.00 → 2469.32] you be a community of grace and encouragement, a community that fosters faith in her as she looks to
[2469.32 → 2476.74] you for help and for strength and for growth. Today begins a journey for her that we hope will
[2476.74 → 2483.86] culminate in seeing her stand in front of us in however many years the Lord takes to work this in her,
[2484.60 → 2493.14] that she then proclaims her faith for herself. She takes advantage of the promise spoken over her today
[2493.14 → 2502.10] and makes that promise her own. But she cannot do that alone. None of us can do that alone. We journey
[2502.10 → 2511.58] in covenant community together. And so even as I stand here with her, you also hold her in faith.
[2512.54 → 2519.30] And so receive the charge and the call of God and remember her in your prayers so that we can
[2519.30 → 2526.18] celebrate the goodness of God together. Amen? Amen. We're going to stand and sing
[2526.18 → 2529.92] together. Good, good Father.
[2536.70 → 2543.02] Before we stand and sing, we do have a gift to mark this occasion. And so Eric Hubert has a certificate
[2543.02 → 2548.68] and a little book for Ava. Encourage you to read that with her and to remind her of what took place
[2548.68 → 2553.40] on this day together. God bless. Let's stand together.
[2553.40 → 2553.46] Amen.
[2553.46 → 2553.50] Amen.
[2553.50 → 2553.54] Amen.
[2553.54 → 2555.54] Amen.
[2555.54 → 2557.54] Amen.
[2557.54 → 2558.06] Amen.
[2558.06 → 2558.54] Amen.
[2558.54 → 2559.54] Amen.
[2559.54 → 2560.54] Amen.
[2560.54 → 2561.54] Amen.
[2561.54 → 2562.54] Amen.
[2562.54 → 2563.54] Amen.
[2563.54 → 2564.54] Amen.
[2564.54 → 2565.54] Amen.
[2565.54 → 2566.54] Amen.
[2566.54 → 2567.54] Amen.
[2567.54 → 2568.54] Amen.
[2568.54 → 2569.54] Amen.
[2569.54 → 2570.54] Amen.
[2570.54 → 2570.58] Amen.
[2573.02 → 2574.28] Amen.
[2574.28 → 2584.50] Ever heard a thousand stories I want, they paint your life, and I have heard a tender
[2584.50 → 2596.18] razor of love, in the dead of my head tonight, I tell thee that you will see me not
[2596.18 → 2598.18] I'm never alone.
[2600.00 → 2603.58] The good, good mother, it's who you are.
[2604.22 → 2605.74] It's who you are.
[2606.44 → 2608.18] It's who you are.
[2608.54 → 2610.36] And I love you.
[2610.88 → 2612.14] It's who I am.
[2612.80 → 2614.30] It's who I am.
[2614.96 → 2617.46] It's who I am.
[2620.10 → 2626.10] I have seen many searching for answers.
[2626.18 → 2634.18] Far and wide when I know we're all searching for answers.
[2635.14 → 2644.18] Only you know my ways to know just what we need before we say a word.
[2645.70 → 2648.30] It's who you are.
[2648.94 → 2650.38] It's who you are.
[2651.06 → 2652.18] It's who you are.
[2652.18 → 2654.18] It's who you are.
[2654.18 → 2656.18] It's who you are.
[2656.18 → 2658.18] It's who you are.
[2658.18 → 2660.18] It's who I am.
[2660.18 → 2662.18] It's who I am.
[2662.18 → 2664.18] It's who I am.
[2664.18 → 2666.18] It's who you are.
[2666.18 → 2668.18] It's who you are.
[2668.18 → 2670.18] It's who you are.
[2670.18 → 2675.78] Wow
[2683.30 → 2683.78] you are
[2683.78 → 2713.76] You are perfect in all of your ways, you are.
[2713.78 → 2721.82] Love so undeniable, I can hardly speak.
[2722.42 → 2732.66] Peace so unexplainable, I can hardly think that you call me.
[2732.66 → 2736.86] Be first, you as you call me.
[2737.24 → 2740.98] Be first, you as you call me.
[2741.34 → 2744.10] Be first, you into love.
[2744.54 → 2748.22] Love, love, love, good, good Father.
[2748.70 → 2750.00] It's who you are.
[2750.50 → 2751.92] It's who you are.
[2752.62 → 2753.66] It's who you are.
[2753.66 → 2763.52] Help, love, love, love, love, love.
[2763.52 → 2764.44] Love, love, love, good Father.
[2765.20 → 2766.62] It's who you are.
[2766.62 → 2768.60] It's who you are.
[2769.22 → 2770.96] It's who you are.
[2771.34 → 2771.94] Help, love, love, love, love, love, love.
[2771.94 → 2775.34] Love, love, love, love, love, love, love.
[2775.34 → 2778.20] Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love.
[2778.20 → 2780.20] Who I am.
[2799.20 → 2801.20] Good morning.
[2801.20 → 2813.20] As some of you are more know, Marlene Bilingual is her official last Sunday at Emanuel Church Family.
[2813.20 → 2818.20] And I was asked to speak a few words about Marlene.
[2818.20 → 2825.20] And I wanted to start with Matthew 25 verse 35 and that's where my story starts.
[2825.20 → 2828.20] And her story starts.
[2828.20 → 2832.20] Matthew 25 verse 35 says,
[2832.20 → 2836.20] I was a stranger, and you invited me in.
[2838.20 → 2842.20] So together with my husband Bert and our family,
[2842.20 → 2852.20] we've known Marlene and her family and this church family, Emmanuel, our loving church family,
[2852.20 → 2854.20] for more than 25 years.
[2854.20 → 2860.20] But years ago, in the early 90s, when our four kids were little,
[2860.20 → 2870.20] I met Marlene as a friendly neighbour, down the street, with her four little blonde boys in tow,
[2870.20 → 2874.20] at our local outdoor swimming pool.
[2874.20 → 2880.20] Who knew that a few years later, we as family would meet again, Marlene,
[2880.20 → 2890.20] now as the official friendly face of welcome to our Langley Christian School community.
[2890.20 → 2900.20] I will never forget how she prayed with me on the phone, making us feel welcome as strangers.
[2900.20 → 2906.20] As we became colleagues and our children attended school together, and we did life together,
[2906.20 → 2908.20] at home and at school and at church,
[2908.20 → 2916.20] Marlene continued to model hospitality to strangers, to new students in her job,
[2916.20 → 2920.20] as coordinator of international students.
[2920.20 → 2928.20] She administered, she organized, she fostered connecting with the other.
[2928.20 → 2934.20] She planned conferences and for students and teachers alike.
[2934.20 → 2938.20] She planned meals together and special events.
[2938.20 → 2944.20] She was also Mrs. Bailing, Mrs. Mom at the office.
[2944.20 → 2950.20] She was a shoulder to cry on, but above all, a listening ear,
[2950.20 → 2962.20] especially to all the students who came from Korea, China, Japan, Macau, Burma, Cuba, over the years.
[2962.20 → 2972.20] In other words, she was a presence, a compassionate presence, a home base for those far from home.
[2972.20 → 2980.20] Throughout all the chapters of life together, as family and as church family,
[2980.20 → 2990.20] through springtime joys and winter sorrows, floods and fires and loss,
[2990.20 → 2996.20] being in the choir singing together, being in the choir singing together and being still together.
[2996.20 → 3004.20] Marlene has shown to be an example of being a steadfast student of God's word
[3004.20 → 3014.20] and wanted to share God's story of redemption.
[3014.20 → 3024.20] In her compassionate way and care of welfare for others, she also worked for the Society of Christian Schools
[3024.20 → 3030.20] and has been involved in bringing refugees to a new world here.
[3030.20 → 3040.20] And she's been involved in coffee break and listening to others in need and responding and caring.
[3040.20 → 3046.20] To sum up in the words of another fellow friend and church member,
[3046.20 → 3054.20] Marlene has contributed a pleasant, caring attitude to Emmanuel.
[3054.20 → 3060.20] She is quick to listen, quick to understand, and quick to empathize.
[3060.20 → 3068.20] We will all miss her faithful, cheery presence as she moves back home to Vernon.
[3068.20 → 3076.20] And like I said to her this morning, you will now have two homes because you can always feel at home here.
[3076.20 → 3086.20] And I just wanted to end with another psalm, one that our family always has used when we depart on a journey.
[3086.20 → 3090.20] It's Psalm 121.
[3090.20 → 3096.20] I lift my eyes to the hills, whether the hills are here or in Vernon.
[3096.20 → 3100.20] Where does our help come from?
[3100.20 → 3104.20] Our help comes from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth.
[3104.20 → 3107.20] He will watch over your life, Marlene.
[3107.20 → 3112.20] He will watch over your coming and you're going from now and evermore.
[3112.20 → 3114.20] Thank you.
[3116.20 → 3118.20] Thank you.
[3118.20 → 3120.20] Thank you.
[3125.20 → 3127.20] Marlene, we would like to pray for you.
[3127.20 → 3130.20] Is it too much to ask for you to come to the front?
[3130.20 → 3132.20] No, it's not too much?
[3132.20 → 3133.20] Would you come to the front?
[3133.20 → 3139.20] I'm going to ask if you would like, if you have supported Marlene as an elder or a pastor,
[3139.20 → 3142.20] if you have walked a journey of faith with her, if you would also come up to the front
[3142.20 → 3146.20] and we can surround her in the laying on of hands in prayer as well.
[3146.20 → 3163.20] If you would like to, where you're seated, also hold out a hand as a sign of the Spirit flowing through you into Marlene,
[3163.20 → 3179.20] and blessing her on this journey ahead, I invite you to do so as well.
[3179.20 → 3183.20] Let's pray together.
[3183.20 → 3189.20] Holy God, this morning we are amazed at your covenant faithfulness to us.
[3189.20 → 3202.20] We see it in little Ava's baptism, and we see it in the testimony of faithfulness in Marlene's life and her commitment to this church family.
[3202.20 → 3208.20] We pray now you're blessing upon Marlene.
[3208.20 → 3214.20] We pray that as she goes to Vernon and plants deep roots in community there,
[3214.20 → 3218.20] alongside deep roots she already has planted with family,
[3218.20 → 3222.20] we pray, Lord God, that you would bless her and keep her.
[3222.20 → 3229.20] That you would continue to make your face to shine upon her and be gracious to her.
[3229.20 → 3237.20] That you, Lord God, would turn your face toward her and in all things give her your peace.
[3237.20 → 3242.20] We pray this blessing in the name of Jesus Christ alone.
[3242.20 → 3243.20] Amen.
[3243.20 → 3245.20] Amen.
[3257.20 → 3258.20] Good morning.
[3258.20 → 3262.20] Good morning, everyone.
[3262.20 → 3264.20] I'm representing the deacons here.
[3264.20 → 3268.20] I'm not a deacon, but Line asked me to speak to the collection for this morning.
[3268.20 → 3272.20] That was very touching, Marlene.
[3272.20 → 3276.20] Marlene is on the Refugee Committee.
[3276.20 → 3278.20] The collection today is for the Refugee Committee.
[3278.20 → 3284.20] I want to, yesterday, a couple, two things happened.
[3284.20 → 3290.20] One is, 13 years ago our pastor, Bill Overstate, passed away.
[3290.20 → 3297.20] And the reason I'm bringing this up this morning is, Bill was with Life Water Canada.
[3297.20 → 3303.20] He also had a, had a, felt a mission and a calling for doing something more than just the church.
[3303.20 → 3311.20] And so he was involved in, in doing a work of bringing water to communities that didn't have water.
[3311.20 → 3319.20] Um, yesterday also was, um, remembrance, world remembrance for the Holocaust day.
[3319.20 → 3337.20] And, um, the reason I'm, I'm bringing that up is, uh, obviously Israel's in, in Palestine, the Palestinians are in, in, uh, maybe I should say Hamas, are, um, in huge conflict right now.
[3337.20 → 3347.20] But, before and during the Second World War, over six million Jews were, um, were killed and murdered.
[3347.20 → 3359.20] And, um, the reason I raise this is, even in Canada, there was a boatload of Jewish people who would come here to try to escape the, uh, what was going on in Germany.
[3359.20 → 3362.20] And, and our country turned them back.
[3362.20 → 3372.20] And, uh, so I think we're very sensitive, uh, and I noticed in this church too, we've been sensitive to anything that has to do with social justice.
[3372.20 → 3380.20] And that's why since, uh, 2015, we've supported the refugee sponsorship program in our church.
[3380.20 → 3387.20] And, uh, I feel, I feel very, very, I feel very, very humbled by that, by that.
[3387.20 → 3388.20] But I also feel very, very good.
[3388.20 → 3391.20] Because that's an important aspect of our church's ministry.
[3391.20 → 3394.20] Currently, we are sponsoring a family.
[3394.20 → 3400.20] We, um, there's a they're in southern Lebanon at the moment.
[3400.20 → 3404.20] And if you follow the news carefully, the Hezbollah is there.
[3404.20 → 3410.20] And the Hezbollah are related to the Hamas, whose basic mission is to destroy Israel.
[3410.20 → 3422.20] They, which has meant all kinds of disruption, which means there's a lot of people looking for asylum, that are looking to get out of countries where there's this persecution.
[3422.20 → 3426.20] And so, in all, one small way, we can be a part of that.
[3426.20 → 3429.20] So, we're asking you to continue to support it.
[3429.20 → 3433.20] We have already 30,000 in the bank, over 30,000 in the bank.
[3433.20 → 3438.20] We need, the government now expects us to have enough to bring in a family.
[3438.20 → 3441.20] So, slowly but surely, it's adding up.
[3441.20 → 3443.20] And we want to thank you for your faithfulness.
[3443.20 → 3456.20] Sometimes this gets confused with the Dean of Nicolai, who's our classes representative in the Lower Mainland, or British Columbia, who works with, uh, connection with World Renew.
[3456.20 → 3458.20] And World Renew Refugee Sponsorship.
[3458.20 → 3461.20] But this one is specific to our church.
[3461.20 → 3463.20] Thank you very much.
[3463.20 → 3488.20] Thank you very much.
[3488.20 → 3516.20] Thank you very much.
[3518.20 → 3546.20] Oh Martine, thank you very much.
[3546.20 → 3551.10] I'm destined for you.
[3555.10 → 3564.02] And I'm lost without you.
[3576.20 → 3606.18] I'm lost without you.
[3606.20 → 3636.18] I'm lost without you.
[3636.20 → 3646.20] And I'm destined for you.
[3646.20 → 3658.20] And I'm lost without you.
[3658.20 → 3672.20] And I'm destined for you.
[3672.20 → 3686.20] And I'm lost without you.
[3686.20 → 3702.20] You are the air I breathe.
[3702.20 → 3710.20] You are the air I breathe.
[3710.20 → 3725.20] I would love to invite all the kids to come up to the front.
[3725.36 → 3727.80] Come and join me up here if you will.
[3727.80 → 3732.80] Here you all come.
[3734.20 → 3734.94] Here you all.
[3734.96 → 3736.06] He's a little shy though.
[3737.26 → 3740.62] Now, welcome up here.
[3740.62 → 3743.76] I see mostly familiar faces.
[3744.00 → 3745.24] Some new faces.
[3745.62 → 3748.68] I have a friend that usually joins me up here.
[3749.02 → 3751.02] For you who have come up before, who is that?
[3751.62 → 3752.26] Hank.
[3752.62 → 3754.12] He's my dog friend.
[3754.22 → 3755.50] But he's a little bit shy.
[3756.10 → 3759.44] So can you all say good morning, Hank?
[3759.90 → 3761.62] Good morning, Hank.
[3761.62 → 3763.62] Hi, everyone.
[3763.62 → 3764.32] Hi, everyone.
[3765.82 → 3767.16] How are you?
[3768.58 → 3769.26] Good.
[3769.68 → 3770.74] Hank, how was France?
[3771.06 → 3771.66] Great.
[3772.48 → 3776.16] I went to France over Christmas break, apparently.
[3777.16 → 3778.42] And was it fun?
[3778.64 → 3779.06] Mm-hmm.
[3779.68 → 3781.02] Did you learn a new language?
[3781.66 → 3782.08] Yep.
[3782.58 → 3783.60] What was that language?
[3784.28 → 3784.80] French.
[3785.34 → 3786.52] Can you give us an example?
[3787.32 → 3789.94] Jem'appeal Hank.
[3790.90 → 3792.20] Pretty good, Hank.
[3792.42 → 3793.16] Anything else?
[3793.76 → 3794.16] Mm-mm.
[3794.66 → 3795.00] Oh, no?
[3795.08 → 3795.52] Why not?
[3795.92 → 3798.06] It was hard to talk without you there.
[3798.28 → 3798.50] Oh.
[3799.58 → 3800.96] I guess that makes sense.
[3802.08 → 3805.78] We are going to talk about something called...
[3805.78 → 3808.52] It's a big word, and I want to see if you kids know what it means.
[3809.14 → 3809.40] All right?
[3809.40 → 3812.36] We're going to talk about identity today.
[3812.78 → 3813.70] What's identity?
[3814.22 → 3815.52] What does identity mean?
[3816.06 → 3816.76] Anybody know?
[3816.88 → 3817.80] It's a big word.
[3818.80 → 3819.58] Hank, do you know?
[3819.84 → 3820.24] Oh, yeah?
[3821.36 → 3825.24] Identity means that anything that you...
[3825.24 → 3829.86] That's right.
[3829.86 → 3831.86] So, like, identity is who...
[3832.52 → 3833.52] Do you want to try Malachi?
[3837.16 → 3838.90] You don't think Hank learned how to...
[3838.90 → 3840.00] How did you get to France?
[3840.94 → 3841.30] Airports.
[3841.62 → 3843.32] They're a beautiful thing.
[3845.90 → 3846.26] Identity.
[3846.54 → 3847.68] Do you know what identity means?
[3849.94 → 3851.18] You went on a plane, too.
[3851.36 → 3851.90] Me, too.
[3852.06 → 3854.04] It was a long flight, let me tell you.
[3855.62 → 3856.80] Oh, that is exciting.
[3857.36 → 3859.92] We're going to circle back to planes when we get to the back room.
[3859.98 → 3863.14] But identity means who we are.
[3863.14 → 3866.46] So it's kind of like who God created you to be, right?
[3866.58 → 3869.36] So, Hank, I've got a question for you.
[3869.56 → 3870.46] Who are you?
[3870.92 → 3872.62] I am Hank the Hound.
[3873.16 → 3875.14] And how do you spell Hank?
[3875.34 → 3876.80] I don't know.
[3877.46 → 3880.36] So, what are some things you love, Hank?
[3880.60 → 3882.28] I love sticks.
[3882.68 → 3884.12] I love bacon.
[3884.12 → 3887.42] I love chasing things.
[3887.80 → 3889.50] And is there anything maybe you don't like?
[3889.66 → 3890.18] Cats!
[3890.44 → 3892.80] I don't like cats.
[3893.34 → 3895.06] I kind of forgot about that, hey?
[3895.38 → 3895.76] Mm-hmm.
[3896.52 → 3898.98] So, what we're going to learn about, though,
[3899.08 → 3901.56] is sometimes we think of our identities,
[3901.70 → 3903.64] we think about things we like, or we love,
[3903.72 → 3904.84] like Hank just did, right?
[3905.08 → 3905.30] Yeah?
[3905.80 → 3906.32] Do you have a question?
[3906.32 → 3911.08] Oh, yeah?
[3911.80 → 3912.36] That's fun.
[3914.32 → 3915.32] We're playing outside?
[3916.12 → 3917.68] Well, we're going to talk about all of those things
[3917.68 → 3919.12] that we love to do in a second.
[3919.40 → 3921.04] But what we're going to learn is that
[3921.04 → 3923.20] sometimes we look at our identity
[3923.20 → 3924.26] and we ask ourselves,
[3924.36 → 3926.28] what are things we like or who we are?
[3926.70 → 3928.82] But do you know what God sees
[3928.82 → 3930.30] when he sees us in heaven?
[3931.62 → 3933.30] He sees us for who we are,
[3933.30 → 3936.90] but he also sees us through the lens
[3936.90 → 3938.38] or through the eyes of Jesus.
[3938.92 → 3940.90] He sees Jesus when he sees us.
[3941.00 → 3941.90] And so we're going to learn that
[3941.90 → 3944.34] the more we know and learn about Jesus,
[3944.66 → 3946.12] the more we get to know about
[3946.12 → 3948.44] who we actually are inside as well.
[3948.52 → 3949.36] Does that sound pretty good?
[3949.90 → 3951.36] So we're going to talk about that in the back, okay?
[3951.48 → 3952.08] Sound good, Hank?
[3952.32 → 3952.64] Yep!
[3953.28 → 3954.88] All right, so we're going to pray
[3954.88 → 3956.68] and then we're going to do the kid's blessing
[3956.68 → 3957.92] and then we'll go to the back room, okay?
[3958.02 → 3958.32] Are you ready?
[3958.40 → 3960.84] Let's bow our heads and fold our hands
[3960.84 → 3961.30] and let's pray.
[3961.38 → 3962.48] Dear God, we thank you for this day.
[3962.48 → 3964.14] Thank you that we could be in church today
[3964.14 → 3965.42] and that we could learn more
[3965.42 → 3967.14] about who you created us to be.
[3967.54 → 3968.62] Will you be with us today
[3968.62 → 3969.80] as we learn more about that
[3969.80 → 3971.54] and be with the grownups as they stay here
[3971.54 → 3973.08] and learn more about you as well?
[3973.26 → 3974.24] We pray this in your name.
[3974.68 → 3974.98] Amen.
[3975.68 → 3976.70] All right, let's stand up
[3976.70 → 3979.08] and in a second we're going to say together,
[3979.50 → 3981.14] the Lord be with you, okay?
[3981.26 → 3983.36] And then the church is going to say that back to us
[3983.36 → 3985.12] and the boys are going to stay here the whole time.
[3985.18 → 3985.64] Right, boys?
[3986.02 → 3986.68] Here we go.
[3987.06 → 3988.22] We're going to say it at the same time.
[3988.66 → 3989.52] One, two, three.
[3989.52 → 3992.04] The Lord be with you.
[3992.04 → 3993.92] And also to be with you.
[3994.02 → 3995.12] All right, let's head to the back.
[3995.12 → 4017.74] I get to follow that every time.
[4017.74 → 4020.66] My name is Paul.
[4020.80 → 4021.50] I'm an elder here
[4021.50 → 4027.58] and I was asked to give up a little bit of an update
[4027.58 → 4030.00] on our past full council meeting,
[4030.16 → 4032.90] which was this week, this past week.
[4034.04 → 4035.78] A couple of things from that meeting
[4035.78 → 4037.84] that I wanted to let you know about.
[4037.84 → 4041.76] Pastor Chris walked us through,
[4042.40 → 4046.14] it was called By the Numbers,
[4046.26 → 4047.26] Emmanuel By the Numbers.
[4047.62 → 4051.10] So, and that sounds kind of dry for some people.
[4051.22 → 4052.18] Some people love numbers,
[4052.36 → 4055.46] but what it meant was,
[4056.02 → 4061.22] and what we saw through the past year
[4061.22 → 4063.62] that God has been super gracious
[4063.62 → 4065.48] and faithful to this community.
[4067.04 → 4070.00] Many people joined us as a community.
[4070.90 → 4072.10] There were baptisms.
[4073.44 → 4075.60] Our family came together
[4075.60 → 4078.28] when Sybil passed away,
[4079.10 → 4082.16] but there's an engagement here
[4082.16 → 4084.70] that is obvious by those numbers.
[4084.70 → 4088.24] Another thing we talked about
[4088.24 → 4090.84] was that classes is going to be coming up
[4090.84 → 4095.30] and some people volunteered to attend that
[4095.30 → 4097.50] and be our representatives there.
[4098.66 → 4100.56] Classes Southwest, British Columbia.
[4102.54 → 4106.36] And something that is going to be coming up
[4106.36 → 4110.34] is nominations for new elders and deacons.
[4110.34 → 4112.90] The terms will,
[4113.42 → 4117.82] a number of people from the council
[4117.82 → 4122.08] will be coming to a close for them
[4122.08 → 4124.40] this time later on this spring.
[4125.10 → 4126.98] So we're going to have a process.
[4128.00 → 4129.74] A number of those will be asked
[4129.74 → 4131.50] to actually extend their term
[4131.50 → 4134.70] because we ended up with a little bit of a lag
[4134.70 → 4135.90] because of COVID.
[4136.92 → 4139.16] So some will be extending their terms,
[4139.16 → 4142.78] but we'll be looking for two elders
[4142.78 → 4144.30] and one deacon.
[4145.30 → 4147.78] So please pray and consider
[4147.78 → 4150.76] putting your name forward for that.
[4152.70 → 4155.18] And I think that's it.
[4156.30 → 4157.06] Thank you.
[4169.16 → 4181.68] I'm Eric Hubert, an elder here at Emmanuel.
[4182.14 → 4184.10] I'll be leading you in our church family prayer.
[4185.98 → 4186.84] Praise the Lord.
[4187.50 → 4189.86] How good it is to sing praises to our God.
[4190.30 → 4192.20] How pleasant and fitting to praise Him.
[4193.74 → 4195.20] Reflecting in this past week
[4195.20 → 4197.76] about all of life's chapters.
[4198.08 → 4200.08] It's comforting knowing the church family
[4200.08 → 4200.80] here at Emmanuel
[4200.80 → 4203.88] has been here since supporting on life's journeys.
[4204.50 → 4205.56] This last week,
[4206.28 → 4210.18] we celebrated the baptisms of Jane.
[4212.82 → 4214.60] Jane and this week,
[4214.68 → 4216.64] it was Ava Rose Skipper today
[4216.64 → 4217.68] for their baptism.
[4217.68 → 4220.62] And just help all of us members
[4220.62 → 4222.02] of the congregation here
[4222.02 → 4223.22] be support to each other
[4223.22 → 4225.14] on these journeys at different stages.
[4226.14 → 4227.14] I know at this time,
[4227.72 → 4228.64] there are many students
[4228.64 → 4230.70] that are having to make some big decisions
[4230.70 → 4232.26] in what's next,
[4232.40 → 4234.16] whether that's from elementary school
[4234.16 → 4234.86] to high school
[4234.86 → 4236.10] or high school to university
[4236.10 → 4238.28] or university on.
[4238.40 → 4239.48] Where do I go to school?
[4239.66 → 4240.52] Where do I move?
[4240.76 → 4241.66] Where do I work?
[4241.92 → 4243.30] Can I find work?
[4243.30 → 4245.28] We trust in you, Lord,
[4245.40 → 4246.30] that you will continue
[4246.30 → 4247.54] to guide us on this journey.
[4248.62 → 4249.20] This week,
[4249.30 → 4250.82] we launched our new podcast,
[4251.82 → 4252.76] North.
[4253.28 → 4255.26] Bless Pastor Chris, Kevin, and Joss
[4255.26 → 4257.06] in this new podcast
[4257.06 → 4258.74] where faith meets real life
[4258.74 → 4260.70] one conversation at a time.
[4262.14 → 4263.34] In these last few months,
[4263.46 → 4265.66] we've had to deal with many deaths
[4265.66 → 4267.32] within our extended congregation
[4267.32 → 4267.96] and family.
[4268.70 → 4270.06] Please continue to support
[4270.06 → 4271.24] those who need comfort.
[4271.24 → 4272.64] This week,
[4272.74 → 4273.78] we learned about the death
[4273.78 → 4275.42] of Mary Jones' dad,
[4276.18 → 4277.84] Arnie Deal Cruz.
[4278.46 → 4280.54] Comfort the family at this time.
[4282.24 → 4284.14] Our merciful Father in heaven,
[4284.30 → 4285.34] we thank you that we are,
[4286.18 → 4287.44] you've provided our faithful
[4287.44 → 4288.46] and gifted people
[4288.46 → 4289.82] to serve here at Emmanuel,
[4290.22 → 4291.26] elders and deacons,
[4291.70 → 4294.50] to continue to fulfill them
[4294.50 → 4295.58] with wisdom
[4295.58 → 4297.42] and grant them the strength
[4297.42 → 4298.54] that makes them faithful
[4298.54 → 4301.46] workers in your vineyard.
[4302.38 → 4303.38] May you bless us
[4303.38 → 4304.82] as we go through the week
[4304.82 → 4306.00] and ground us
[4306.00 → 4307.16] and root us in your word.
[4307.54 → 4308.26] In Jesus' name,
[4308.64 → 4309.02] we pray.
[4309.46 → 4309.68] Amen.
[4309.68 → 4309.80] Amen.
[4309.80 → 4327.64] I'm going to invite you
[4327.64 → 4329.52] to turn in your Bible
[4329.52 → 4330.74] or turn on your Bible,
[4330.86 → 4331.82] whatever the case may be.
[4332.16 → 4333.02] We're going to continue
[4333.02 → 4334.96] looking at the letter
[4334.96 → 4335.74] to the Romans.
[4335.74 → 4339.12] We are going to finish
[4339.12 → 4339.98] this morning
[4339.98 → 4341.70] the really dense section
[4341.70 → 4344.58] of chapters 9 through 11
[4344.58 → 4348.12] with a text about worship
[4348.12 → 4350.12] and a text of worship
[4350.12 → 4351.88] in Romans 11,
[4352.08 → 4354.12] verse 33 to 36.
[4356.40 → 4357.84] It will be on the screen
[4357.84 → 4359.38] behind me the first time through
[4359.38 → 4360.46] and I encourage you
[4360.46 → 4361.46] to keep it in front of you
[4361.46 → 4362.14] as we go.
[4362.14 → 4365.42] This is the word of the Lord.
[4366.52 → 4368.48] Oh, the depth of the riches
[4368.48 → 4369.50] of the wisdom
[4369.50 → 4371.32] and knowledge of God.
[4371.94 → 4373.36] How unsearchable
[4373.36 → 4374.50] His judgments
[4374.50 → 4375.64] and His paths
[4375.64 → 4377.12] beyond tracing out.
[4378.08 → 4379.20] Who has known
[4379.20 → 4380.48] the mind of the Lord
[4380.48 → 4381.66] or who has been
[4381.66 → 4382.36] His counsellor?
[4383.28 → 4385.42] Who has ever given to God
[4385.42 → 4387.22] that God should repay them?
[4388.32 → 4389.38] For from Him
[4389.38 → 4390.80] and through Him
[4390.80 → 4392.44] and for Him
[4392.44 → 4394.30] are all things.
[4394.46 → 4394.98] To Him
[4394.98 → 4397.08] be the glory forever.
[4397.90 → 4398.26] Amen.
[4399.42 → 4400.76] This is the word of the Lord.
[4400.76 → 4401.86] Thank you.
[4406.06 → 4407.44] Sometime
[4407.44 → 4408.62] in the
[4408.62 → 4410.82] Enlightenment period,
[4412.08 → 4412.78] and so that's
[4412.78 → 4413.56] the sort of
[4413.56 → 4415.02] late 16th
[4415.02 → 4417.14] to mid 18th century,
[4417.72 → 4419.06] sometime there
[4419.06 → 4421.30] people began
[4421.30 → 4422.84] thinking about
[4422.84 → 4423.72] the world
[4423.72 → 4426.58] with increasing
[4426.58 → 4427.62] distance
[4427.62 → 4429.68] to the Bible
[4429.68 → 4430.88] or to how
[4430.88 → 4432.58] they had thought
[4432.58 → 4433.26] previously
[4433.26 → 4434.46] using the Bible
[4434.46 → 4435.46] in the world.
[4436.28 → 4437.82] At the same time,
[4438.22 → 4439.42] areas like
[4439.42 → 4440.62] natural sciences
[4440.62 → 4442.28] explode
[4442.28 → 4443.42] and develop
[4443.42 → 4445.52] even if
[4445.52 → 4446.28] that explosion
[4446.28 → 4447.02] comes from
[4447.02 → 4447.80] many scientists
[4447.80 → 4448.34] who were
[4448.34 → 4448.88] themselves
[4448.88 → 4449.92] largely Christian
[4449.92 → 4450.62] trying to
[4450.62 → 4451.12] understand the
[4451.12 → 4451.94] world that
[4451.94 → 4453.06] they find
[4453.06 → 4453.68] themselves in.
[4454.72 → 4455.56] The reason I
[4455.56 → 4456.58] introduce in this
[4456.58 → 4457.46] way is because
[4457.46 → 4458.34] a term
[4458.34 → 4459.48] started being
[4459.48 → 4460.68] used for
[4460.68 → 4461.30] humans,
[4461.46 → 4462.04] for people,
[4462.04 → 4463.30] during this time.
[4463.92 → 4465.12] As far as I could
[4465.12 → 4465.86] tell in my
[4465.86 → 4466.84] quick research,
[4467.02 → 4467.88] the first usage
[4467.88 → 4468.62] of this term
[4468.62 → 4469.06] is from
[4469.06 → 4470.42] 1774
[4470.42 → 4471.62] by Lord
[4471.62 → 4472.40] Mindoro,
[4472.80 → 4473.94] who was a judge
[4473.94 → 4474.76] and a philosopher.
[4474.76 → 4475.64] And the term
[4475.64 → 4476.30] is
[4476.30 → 4477.68] Homo sapiens.
[4479.22 → 4480.54] Homo sapiens
[4480.54 → 4482.56] literally means
[4482.56 → 4483.62] in Latin
[4483.62 → 4486.06] creature
[4486.06 → 4487.14] or human
[4487.14 → 4488.20] wise
[4488.20 → 4489.14] or wise
[4489.14 → 4489.68] human
[4489.68 → 4491.02] or thinking
[4491.02 → 4492.10] person.
[4492.64 → 4493.50] The idea
[4493.50 → 4494.30] is that
[4494.30 → 4494.66] what's
[4494.66 → 4495.36] separating
[4495.36 → 4496.30] humanity
[4496.30 → 4497.54] from the
[4497.54 → 4498.22] genus
[4498.22 → 4499.34] of homo
[4499.34 → 4500.88] is our
[4500.88 → 4501.50] ability
[4501.50 → 4502.60] to think,
[4503.14 → 4504.18] to cognate.
[4506.02 → 4506.74] Descartes,
[4506.98 → 4507.48] famously,
[4507.98 → 4508.84] some hundred
[4508.84 → 4509.58] years before
[4509.58 → 4510.08] the term
[4510.08 → 4510.80] Homo sapiens
[4510.80 → 4511.30] is used,
[4511.70 → 4512.00] says,
[4512.20 → 4512.82] bonito
[4512.82 → 4513.82] ergo sum.
[4514.70 → 4515.28] In fact,
[4515.42 → 4515.92] in French,
[4516.46 → 4517.00] JE sense,
[4517.22 → 4517.92] done JE suit.
[4517.92 → 4519.36] I think,
[4519.80 → 4520.34] therefore I
[4520.34 → 4520.68] am.
[4521.86 → 4522.34] And that
[4522.34 → 4522.98] way of
[4522.98 → 4523.68] understanding
[4523.68 → 4524.08] what it
[4524.08 → 4524.58] means to
[4524.58 → 4525.30] be human
[4525.30 → 4526.16] sort of
[4526.16 → 4527.38] sets the
[4527.38 → 4529.12] agenda
[4529.12 → 4530.20] for
[4530.20 → 4531.22] anthropology,
[4531.58 → 4532.12] for thoughts
[4532.12 → 4532.88] about being
[4532.88 → 4533.34] human,
[4533.66 → 4534.52] for the
[4534.52 → 4534.94] next
[4534.94 → 4535.90] centuries
[4535.90 → 4537.86] and continues
[4537.86 → 4538.26] in many
[4538.26 → 4538.72] respects
[4538.72 → 4539.56] to today.
[4541.64 → 4541.90] Now,
[4541.98 → 4542.80] more recently,
[4543.22 → 4544.08] a Christian
[4544.08 → 4544.86] philosopher
[4544.86 → 4546.10] by the
[4546.10 → 4546.64] name of
[4546.64 → 4547.24] James K.
[4547.30 → 4547.44] A.
[4547.50 → 4547.80] Smith
[4547.80 → 4549.76] challenges
[4549.76 → 4550.58] the
[4550.58 → 4551.28] fundamental
[4551.28 → 4551.90] assumption
[4551.90 → 4552.64] that
[4552.64 → 4553.62] humans
[4553.62 → 4554.12] are
[4554.12 → 4554.92] primarily
[4554.92 → 4555.82] thinking
[4555.82 → 4556.54] creatures,
[4556.68 → 4557.04] or that's
[4557.04 → 4557.88] what defines
[4557.88 → 4558.60] who we
[4558.60 → 4558.80] are.
[4559.10 → 4559.48] Instead,
[4560.16 → 4561.04] Jamie Smith
[4561.04 → 4562.04] says that
[4562.04 → 4562.94] humans are
[4562.94 → 4564.16] desiring
[4564.16 → 4565.54] creatures.
[4567.42 → 4568.18] Right?
[4568.26 → 4568.50] That we
[4568.50 → 4568.96] are
[4568.96 → 4570.72] creatures
[4570.72 → 4572.06] who love
[4572.06 → 4573.00] first.
[4573.98 → 4574.16] And so
[4574.16 → 4574.48] there's a
[4574.48 → 4575.18] contrast,
[4575.34 → 4575.60] right,
[4575.76 → 4576.88] that's going
[4576.88 → 4577.46] on here
[4577.46 → 4577.94] between
[4577.94 → 4579.20] our human
[4579.20 → 4579.66] people,
[4579.86 → 4580.36] primarily
[4580.36 → 4581.58] what Smith
[4581.58 → 4582.36] characterizes
[4582.36 → 4583.04] as a brain
[4583.04 → 4583.76] on a stick,
[4584.20 → 4585.14] or are you
[4585.14 → 4585.68] a heart
[4585.68 → 4586.90] with a soul?
[4587.78 → 4588.52] Smith writes,
[4588.62 → 4589.30] and you can
[4589.30 → 4589.64] see it,
[4589.64 → 4590.76] we are what
[4590.76 → 4591.50] we love,
[4591.64 → 4592.22] and our love
[4592.22 → 4592.92] is shaped,
[4593.34 → 4593.92] primed,
[4593.98 → 4594.58] and aimed
[4594.58 → 4595.54] by liturgical
[4595.54 → 4596.56] practices that
[4596.56 → 4597.22] take hold of
[4597.22 → 4598.28] our gut and
[4598.28 → 4598.88] aim our
[4598.88 → 4599.58] heart to
[4599.58 → 4600.36] certain ends.
[4601.96 → 4602.26] And so
[4602.26 → 4603.72] to speak
[4603.72 → 4604.78] like Descartes,
[4605.28 → 4607.82] ammo ergo sum,
[4608.24 → 4609.02] I love,
[4609.32 → 4610.64] therefore I am.
[4611.64 → 4612.20] Now this
[4612.20 → 4612.60] morning,
[4613.32 → 4614.50] with credit to
[4614.50 → 4616.20] Jamie Smith and
[4616.20 → 4617.06] to the tradition
[4617.06 → 4618.36] of Descartes,
[4618.46 → 4619.66] I would like to
[4619.66 → 4620.64] take those two
[4620.64 → 4621.26] things,
[4621.32 → 4622.60] I think and I
[4622.60 → 4623.02] love,
[4623.02 → 4623.90] therefore I am,
[4623.98 → 4624.78] and put them
[4624.78 → 4625.88] together into
[4625.88 → 4626.58] what I think is
[4626.58 → 4627.24] more accurate
[4627.24 → 4630.08] and a more
[4630.08 → 4631.66] faithful understanding
[4631.66 → 4632.38] of what it means
[4632.38 → 4633.00] to be human.
[4633.76 → 4634.52] To that end,
[4634.62 → 4635.54] I think we can
[4635.54 → 4636.08] say,
[4636.56 → 4638.64] adorn ergo sum,
[4639.40 → 4640.54] I worship,
[4641.34 → 4643.04] therefore I am.
[4643.04 → 4644.86] I am.
[4644.86 → 4644.98] I am going to
[4644.98 → 4645.94] suggest to you
[4645.94 → 4647.16] that humans
[4647.16 → 4648.88] are first
[4648.88 → 4649.84] and foremost
[4649.84 → 4651.00] worshipping
[4651.00 → 4652.16] creatures.
[4653.78 → 4654.12] And yes,
[4654.20 → 4654.58] this is an
[4654.58 → 4655.26] aspect of what
[4655.26 → 4656.00] Smith talks about
[4656.00 → 4656.74] his desiring,
[4657.18 → 4657.84] but it is also
[4657.84 → 4658.84] an aspect of
[4658.84 → 4659.84] our thinking
[4659.84 → 4660.68] and our reflection.
[4661.90 → 4662.02] Right?
[4662.10 → 4662.78] This isn't a
[4662.78 → 4663.42] question of
[4663.42 → 4664.24] whether
[4664.24 → 4664.88] we worship,
[4665.68 → 4666.44] but who
[4666.44 → 4667.78] or what
[4667.78 → 4668.36] and in what
[4668.36 → 4669.56] way do we
[4669.56 → 4669.82] worship.
[4670.68 → 4670.90] Now,
[4671.12 → 4671.94] let us make sure
[4671.94 → 4672.26] we are on the
[4672.26 → 4672.88] same page
[4672.88 → 4673.70] and we will
[4673.70 → 4674.34] define some
[4674.34 → 4675.14] terms for a
[4675.14 → 4675.38] moment.
[4676.12 → 4677.16] Simply put,
[4677.90 → 4679.60] worship is
[4679.60 → 4681.08] acknowledging the
[4681.08 → 4682.58] supreme worth
[4682.58 → 4684.38] or value of
[4684.38 → 4685.52] something in
[4685.52 → 4686.18] our lives.
[4686.82 → 4687.94] Worship is the
[4687.94 → 4688.78] thing that you
[4688.78 → 4690.48] pursue at the
[4690.48 → 4691.34] expense of
[4691.34 → 4692.10] other things.
[4693.58 → 4693.90] Or,
[4694.00 → 4694.44] even more
[4694.44 → 4694.84] simply,
[4695.08 → 4696.12] and you can
[4696.12 → 4697.78] quantitatively
[4697.78 → 4698.50] check this for
[4698.50 → 4699.18] your own life,
[4699.40 → 4701.40] worship is where
[4701.40 → 4702.32] your attention
[4702.32 → 4703.32] goes.
[4704.96 → 4705.16] So,
[4705.22 → 4705.46] what do you
[4705.46 → 4705.92] spend your
[4705.92 → 4706.92] time reflecting
[4706.92 → 4708.06] on or doing?
[4708.16 → 4708.68] What we give
[4708.68 → 4709.56] our attention
[4709.56 → 4712.02] to is what
[4712.02 → 4712.56] we worship
[4712.56 → 4713.40] or reveals
[4713.40 → 4714.58] what we
[4714.58 → 4714.86] worship.
[4716.22 → 4717.30] And so,
[4717.50 → 4718.42] it is the
[4718.42 → 4720.30] thinking and
[4720.30 → 4720.92] the loving
[4720.92 → 4721.90] that come
[4721.90 → 4723.54] together in
[4723.54 → 4724.10] our worship,
[4724.70 → 4725.06] in our
[4725.06 → 4725.60] worshipping.
[4726.24 → 4726.92] And I think
[4726.92 → 4728.20] that since the
[4728.20 → 4729.20] thinking and the
[4729.20 → 4729.92] loving come
[4729.92 → 4731.34] together in
[4731.34 → 4732.22] our worship
[4732.22 → 4732.90] and in this
[4732.90 → 4733.88] act of worship
[4733.88 → 4735.32] and worshipping,
[4735.66 → 4737.12] I want to say
[4737.12 → 4737.86] that that is
[4737.86 → 4740.20] fundamental to
[4740.20 → 4741.38] our anthropology,
[4741.70 → 4742.14] to what it
[4742.14 → 4743.16] means to be
[4743.16 → 4743.90] human.
[4744.78 → 4745.80] The kinds of
[4745.80 → 4746.38] things that we
[4746.38 → 4747.44] think about and
[4747.44 → 4748.38] the kinds of
[4748.38 → 4749.48] things or the
[4749.48 → 4750.52] people or the
[4750.52 → 4751.48] beings who we
[4751.48 → 4752.92] love matters.
[4754.24 → 4754.82] And so,
[4754.90 → 4755.24] of course,
[4755.30 → 4756.34] it's important for
[4756.34 → 4757.28] us to reflect on
[4757.28 → 4758.42] that and to
[4758.42 → 4759.08] spend some time
[4759.08 → 4760.00] thinking about
[4760.00 → 4760.62] what shapes
[4760.62 → 4762.08] those loves
[4762.08 → 4763.08] and practices
[4763.08 → 4764.16] and worship.
[4765.06 → 4765.98] Our worship
[4765.98 → 4767.08] shapes our
[4767.08 → 4768.18] practices and
[4768.18 → 4769.14] so our practices
[4769.14 → 4770.64] in turn shape
[4770.64 → 4771.26] our lives.
[4772.48 → 4772.96] That's just
[4772.96 → 4773.48] another way of
[4773.48 → 4774.12] saying what we
[4774.12 → 4775.04] do impacts
[4775.04 → 4775.58] who we are.
[4776.52 → 4777.14] What we
[4777.14 → 4777.74] worship,
[4778.10 → 4778.70] therefore,
[4778.88 → 4780.62] determines who
[4780.62 → 4781.04] we are.
[4782.38 → 4782.68] Now,
[4782.72 → 4783.32] given this
[4783.32 → 4784.32] clear truth,
[4784.38 → 4785.14] I think it's
[4785.14 → 4786.08] really important
[4786.08 → 4787.60] to reflect on
[4787.60 → 4788.32] the kinds of
[4788.32 → 4789.02] things that
[4789.02 → 4790.14] cause us to
[4790.14 → 4790.54] worship,
[4790.68 → 4791.20] the kinds of
[4791.20 → 4791.96] things that
[4791.96 → 4793.10] shape our
[4793.10 → 4794.08] worshipping.
[4794.76 → 4795.66] In the Bible
[4795.66 → 4796.14] text this
[4796.14 → 4796.44] morning,
[4797.16 → 4798.38] Paul gives
[4798.38 → 4799.12] us what I
[4799.12 → 4799.86] believe to be
[4799.86 → 4800.64] an excellent
[4800.64 → 4801.88] example of
[4801.88 → 4803.10] how good
[4803.10 → 4803.94] theology,
[4804.92 → 4806.04] and theology
[4806.04 → 4807.46] is good ideas
[4807.46 → 4808.18] and doctrines
[4808.18 → 4808.86] about who God
[4808.86 → 4809.18] is,
[4809.34 → 4809.84] that good
[4809.84 → 4810.56] theology
[4810.56 → 4811.62] naturally
[4811.62 → 4813.02] turns into
[4813.02 → 4813.84] praise.
[4813.84 → 4817.66] let me put
[4817.66 → 4818.00] it together
[4818.00 → 4818.50] another way.
[4821.24 → 4821.84] Superficial
[4821.84 → 4822.92] ideas about
[4822.92 → 4824.54] God will
[4824.54 → 4825.08] lead to
[4825.08 → 4825.64] superficial
[4825.64 → 4826.54] worship of
[4826.54 → 4826.84] God.
[4828.66 → 4829.24] Think of it
[4829.24 → 4829.78] by analogy.
[4830.12 → 4830.48] The more
[4830.48 → 4831.00] you know
[4831.00 → 4831.48] someone,
[4831.66 → 4831.94] the more
[4831.94 → 4832.42] you know
[4832.42 → 4832.82] about
[4832.82 → 4833.32] someone,
[4833.46 → 4834.00] the deeper
[4834.00 → 4834.98] your affections
[4834.98 → 4835.62] for them
[4835.62 → 4836.14] can be.
[4837.56 → 4838.28] In our
[4838.28 → 4838.64] series,
[4838.78 → 4839.08] through the
[4839.08 → 4839.52] book of
[4839.52 → 4839.92] Romans,
[4840.08 → 4840.56] Paul has
[4840.56 → 4841.00] just spent
[4841.00 → 4841.40] the last
[4841.40 → 4842.28] three chapters
[4842.28 → 4844.58] digging deep
[4844.58 → 4845.44] into the
[4845.44 → 4845.94] sovereignty
[4845.94 → 4846.62] of God,
[4846.74 → 4847.38] digging deep
[4847.38 → 4847.86] into the
[4847.86 → 4848.30] hope and
[4848.30 → 4848.86] the promise
[4848.86 → 4849.66] of salvation,
[4850.16 → 4850.82] digging deep
[4850.82 → 4851.40] into the
[4851.40 → 4852.00] complexities
[4852.00 → 4852.66] and the
[4852.66 → 4853.10] mysteries
[4853.10 → 4854.24] of election,
[4854.78 → 4855.40] digging deep
[4855.40 → 4856.02] into the
[4856.02 → 4856.90] unsearchable
[4856.90 → 4858.26] and unfathomable
[4858.26 → 4859.38] beyond tracing
[4859.38 → 4860.36] out ways
[4860.36 → 4860.90] of God.
[4860.98 → 4861.30] And now
[4861.30 → 4861.86] he comes
[4861.86 → 4862.20] to the
[4862.20 → 4862.86] point at
[4862.86 → 4863.20] the end
[4863.20 → 4863.54] of all
[4863.54 → 4864.02] that deep
[4864.02 → 4864.28] digging,
[4864.78 → 4865.84] and he
[4865.84 → 4866.94] can't help
[4866.94 → 4868.20] but worship.
[4868.20 → 4870.32] good
[4870.32 → 4871.04] theology
[4871.04 → 4872.04] leads
[4872.04 → 4872.64] to
[4872.64 → 4873.86] doxology.
[4875.48 → 4876.14] Doxology
[4876.14 → 4876.86] is the
[4876.86 → 4877.44] word we
[4877.44 → 4877.92] use in
[4877.92 → 4878.36] the church
[4878.36 → 4879.22] that means
[4879.22 → 4880.70] speaking glory
[4880.70 → 4881.22] or a
[4881.22 → 4881.96] word of
[4881.96 → 4882.48] glory.
[4882.66 → 4882.84] It's a
[4882.84 → 4883.14] combination
[4883.14 → 4883.84] of two
[4883.84 → 4884.20] Greek
[4884.20 → 4884.60] words,
[4885.06 → 4885.42] Dora,
[4885.58 → 4885.88] which means
[4885.88 → 4886.38] praise or
[4886.38 → 4886.70] glory,
[4886.86 → 4887.42] and logos,
[4887.70 → 4888.00] which means
[4888.00 → 4888.52] word or
[4888.52 → 4889.04] to speak.
[4889.62 → 4890.26] Doxology.
[4890.68 → 4891.40] Doxology
[4891.40 → 4892.04] then is an
[4892.04 → 4892.90] expression of
[4892.90 → 4894.02] praise to
[4894.02 → 4894.54] God.
[4894.64 → 4894.92] It's a
[4894.92 → 4895.52] confession
[4895.52 → 4897.28] of adoration.
[4898.20 → 4899.68] If you've
[4899.68 → 4900.18] been around
[4900.18 → 4901.62] churches,
[4901.90 → 4902.34] and especially
[4902.34 → 4902.94] our church
[4902.94 → 4903.44] tradition,
[4903.74 → 4904.70] for a while,
[4904.82 → 4905.16] you might
[4905.16 → 4906.00] know that
[4906.00 → 4906.66] sometimes at
[4906.66 → 4906.96] the end
[4906.96 → 4907.40] of worship
[4907.40 → 4907.94] we sing
[4907.94 → 4908.38] a song
[4908.38 → 4908.66] that's
[4908.66 → 4909.02] called
[4909.02 → 4909.28] the
[4909.28 → 4910.02] doxology,
[4910.54 → 4910.68] right?
[4910.80 → 4911.10] Praise
[4911.10 → 4911.48] God
[4911.48 → 4912.04] from whom
[4912.04 → 4912.74] all blessings
[4912.74 → 4913.14] flow.
[4913.32 → 4913.62] Praise
[4913.62 → 4913.94] him,
[4914.02 → 4914.54] all creatures
[4914.54 → 4915.12] here below.
[4917.92 → 4918.42] And so
[4918.42 → 4920.10] using this
[4920.10 → 4922.02] text from
[4922.02 → 4922.82] Romans 11,
[4923.60 → 4924.76] these four
[4924.76 → 4925.48] verses here,
[4925.88 → 4926.48] I would
[4926.48 → 4927.28] like for
[4927.28 → 4927.88] us to
[4927.88 → 4928.56] spend the
[4928.56 → 4928.80] rest of
[4928.80 → 4929.32] our time
[4929.32 → 4930.30] outlining
[4930.30 → 4931.02] some of
[4931.02 → 4931.78] the things,
[4931.90 → 4932.14] some of
[4932.14 → 4932.76] the ideas,
[4932.88 → 4933.14] or some
[4933.14 → 4933.38] of the
[4933.38 → 4933.92] structures
[4933.92 → 4935.50] that ought
[4935.50 → 4936.08] to be
[4936.08 → 4936.68] included
[4936.68 → 4938.80] in our
[4938.80 → 4939.48] approach
[4939.48 → 4940.04] to
[4940.04 → 4940.58] right
[4940.58 → 4941.56] worship.
[4943.14 → 4943.50] Okay,
[4943.54 → 4943.80] now this
[4943.80 → 4944.04] isn't
[4944.04 → 4944.54] comprehensive,
[4945.12 → 4945.52] there will
[4945.52 → 4945.84] be things
[4945.84 → 4946.04] that we
[4946.04 → 4946.38] don't touch
[4946.38 → 4946.92] upon today,
[4947.10 → 4947.70] but at
[4947.70 → 4948.46] least these
[4948.46 → 4949.40] four things
[4949.40 → 4950.42] need to
[4950.42 → 4951.28] shape part
[4951.28 → 4952.04] of our
[4952.04 → 4952.90] understanding
[4952.90 → 4953.84] of worship.
[4954.02 → 4954.64] And then,
[4954.82 → 4955.30] based on
[4955.30 → 4955.56] that,
[4955.62 → 4955.94] I want us
[4955.94 → 4956.54] to recognize
[4956.54 → 4957.18] that if
[4957.18 → 4957.72] we are
[4957.72 → 4958.76] worshipping
[4958.76 → 4959.66] creatures,
[4960.40 → 4961.30] right worship
[4961.30 → 4962.86] means living
[4962.86 → 4963.66] in line
[4963.66 → 4964.78] with our
[4964.78 → 4965.52] purpose.
[4966.80 → 4967.34] And so
[4967.34 → 4968.80] getting worship
[4968.80 → 4969.60] right and
[4969.60 → 4970.66] rightly oriented
[4970.66 → 4971.20] or rightly
[4971.20 → 4971.66] directed,
[4971.92 → 4972.70] rightly weighted,
[4973.20 → 4973.96] that means
[4973.96 → 4975.00] getting our
[4975.00 → 4975.72] humanity
[4975.72 → 4976.78] right.
[4978.06 → 4978.62] And so
[4978.62 → 4979.16] this is all
[4979.16 → 4980.18] actually about
[4980.18 → 4981.10] understanding
[4981.10 → 4981.70] who you
[4981.70 → 4982.26] are
[4982.26 → 4983.94] in light
[4983.94 → 4984.82] of our
[4984.82 → 4985.36] understanding
[4985.36 → 4985.80] of whom
[4985.80 → 4986.20] God
[4986.20 → 4987.04] is.
[4988.36 → 4988.60] In fact,
[4988.72 → 4989.30] Grenades
[4989.30 → 4990.32] is a
[4990.32 → 4990.82] church father
[4990.82 → 4991.20] from the
[4991.20 → 4991.86] early second
[4991.86 → 4992.44] century
[4992.44 → 4993.38] of the
[4993.38 → 4993.70] Christian
[4993.70 → 4994.12] church,
[4994.14 → 4994.46] and he
[4994.46 → 4994.92] says,
[4995.40 → 4996.46] rather plainly,
[4996.56 → 4997.12] the glory
[4997.12 → 4997.86] of God
[4997.86 → 4998.48] is the
[4998.48 → 4999.38] human being
[4999.38 → 5000.00] fully
[5000.00 → 5000.88] alive.
[5002.16 → 5002.90] Part of
[5002.90 → 5003.24] what that
[5003.24 → 5003.76] means is
[5003.76 → 5004.08] that for
[5004.08 → 5004.56] us to
[5004.56 → 5005.12] be fully
[5005.12 → 5005.56] human,
[5005.76 → 5006.04] fully
[5006.04 → 5006.64] alive,
[5006.82 → 5007.50] it means
[5007.50 → 5007.86] we need
[5007.86 → 5008.38] to rightly
[5008.38 → 5009.18] encounter
[5009.18 → 5010.50] and engage
[5010.50 → 5011.84] and glorify
[5011.84 → 5012.52] God.
[5014.24 → 5014.56] And so
[5014.56 → 5015.02] as we look
[5015.02 → 5015.32] at what
[5015.32 → 5016.30] Paul says
[5016.30 → 5016.48] here,
[5016.56 → 5016.78] we will
[5016.78 → 5017.28] make four
[5017.28 → 5017.76] points.
[5017.84 → 5018.26] The first
[5018.26 → 5019.12] point to
[5019.12 → 5020.50] make is
[5020.50 → 5021.56] that right
[5021.56 → 5022.68] worship is
[5022.68 → 5024.16] exalting in
[5024.16 → 5024.92] who God
[5024.92 → 5025.76] is and
[5025.76 → 5026.52] what God
[5026.52 → 5027.08] does.
[5028.06 → 5028.76] Verse 33
[5028.76 → 5029.26] says,
[5029.98 → 5030.18] Oh,
[5030.30 → 5030.96] the depths
[5030.96 → 5031.44] of the
[5031.44 → 5032.12] riches of
[5032.12 → 5032.64] the wisdom
[5032.64 → 5033.20] and the
[5033.20 → 5034.18] knowledge of
[5034.18 → 5034.50] God.
[5035.60 → 5035.82] Now,
[5036.16 → 5037.28] if you
[5037.28 → 5037.74] have
[5037.74 → 5039.04] the eyes
[5039.04 → 5039.52] to see
[5039.52 → 5039.92] and to
[5039.92 → 5040.30] remember
[5040.30 → 5041.00] this long
[5041.00 → 5041.28] journey
[5041.28 → 5041.76] that we've
[5041.76 → 5042.30] been on,
[5042.42 → 5043.04] this is
[5043.04 → 5043.64] not new
[5043.64 → 5044.42] language for
[5044.42 → 5044.74] Paul.
[5045.72 → 5046.28] In the
[5046.28 → 5046.80] beginning of
[5046.80 → 5047.10] the letter,
[5047.20 → 5047.74] already in
[5047.74 → 5048.52] chapter 2,
[5049.02 → 5049.68] Paul says,
[5049.86 → 5050.18] Do you
[5050.18 → 5050.94] show contempt
[5050.94 → 5051.48] for the
[5051.48 → 5052.30] riches of
[5052.30 → 5053.14] his kindness,
[5053.68 → 5054.34] forbearance,
[5054.48 → 5055.06] and patience?
[5055.86 → 5056.32] Throughout,
[5056.52 → 5056.96] Paul's
[5056.96 → 5057.58] theology
[5057.58 → 5058.72] reveals the
[5058.72 → 5059.08] riches,
[5059.38 → 5060.48] the magnitude,
[5060.88 → 5061.60] the abundance
[5061.60 → 5062.52] of God's
[5062.52 → 5063.06] kindness,
[5063.72 → 5064.48] and his
[5064.48 → 5065.36] forbearance.
[5065.78 → 5066.42] That's a
[5066.42 → 5067.48] fancy word
[5067.48 → 5067.88] for his
[5067.88 → 5068.54] waiting in
[5068.54 → 5068.90] mercy,
[5069.10 → 5069.38] his
[5069.38 → 5070.16] forbearance,
[5070.24 → 5070.84] and his
[5070.84 → 5071.62] patience.
[5073.00 → 5073.58] Paul uses
[5073.58 → 5074.26] this same
[5074.26 → 5075.26] language of
[5075.26 → 5076.06] riches in
[5076.06 → 5076.80] chapter 9,
[5076.90 → 5077.68] in verse 23.
[5078.68 → 5079.14] He says,
[5079.28 → 5080.00] What if God
[5080.00 → 5080.72] did this
[5080.72 → 5081.24] to make
[5081.24 → 5081.98] the riches
[5081.98 → 5082.82] of his
[5082.82 → 5083.94] glory known
[5083.94 → 5084.44] to the
[5084.44 → 5084.98] objects
[5084.98 → 5085.74] of his
[5085.74 → 5086.10] mercy?
[5087.68 → 5088.48] If the
[5088.48 → 5089.30] question of
[5089.30 → 5090.28] right worship
[5090.28 → 5091.70] centres around
[5091.70 → 5092.24] the right
[5092.24 → 5093.10] object of
[5093.10 → 5093.46] worship,
[5093.78 → 5094.38] we must
[5094.38 → 5095.02] recognize,
[5095.22 → 5095.38] therefore,
[5095.38 → 5095.80] that it
[5095.80 → 5096.88] is God
[5096.88 → 5097.48] who is
[5097.48 → 5098.30] rich in
[5098.30 → 5099.14] glory,
[5099.82 → 5100.22] and that
[5100.22 → 5100.58] it means
[5100.58 → 5100.94] that it
[5100.94 → 5101.48] is God
[5101.48 → 5101.92] who is
[5101.92 → 5102.74] rich in
[5102.74 → 5103.50] worthiness
[5103.50 → 5103.94] to be
[5103.94 → 5104.44] praised,
[5104.78 → 5105.44] who is
[5105.44 → 5106.24] the most
[5106.24 → 5106.74] holy,
[5106.94 → 5107.36] the most
[5107.36 → 5107.78] righteous,
[5107.98 → 5108.56] true light
[5108.56 → 5109.48] of true
[5109.48 → 5109.82] light.
[5111.40 → 5112.00] And then
[5112.00 → 5112.54] Paul continues
[5112.54 → 5112.88] in the
[5112.88 → 5114.42] same chapter,
[5115.06 → 5115.96] Paul uses
[5115.96 → 5116.40] the language
[5116.40 → 5116.82] of riches
[5116.82 → 5117.26] again,
[5117.58 → 5118.12] talking about
[5118.12 → 5118.80] the Gentiles
[5118.80 → 5119.10] and the
[5119.10 → 5119.56] Israelites
[5119.56 → 5120.84] being saved
[5120.84 → 5121.16] by the
[5121.16 → 5121.58] mercy of
[5121.58 → 5121.82] God.
[5121.90 → 5122.16] In verse
[5122.16 → 5122.44] 11,
[5122.52 → 5122.86] he says,
[5123.38 → 5123.86] if their
[5123.86 → 5124.62] transgression
[5124.62 → 5125.68] means riches
[5125.68 → 5126.20] for the
[5126.20 → 5127.20] world and
[5127.20 → 5127.74] their loss
[5127.74 → 5128.32] means riches
[5128.32 → 5128.68] for the
[5128.68 → 5129.18] Gentiles,
[5129.28 → 5129.72] how much
[5129.72 → 5130.56] greater riches
[5130.56 → 5131.12] will their
[5131.12 → 5132.16] full inclusion
[5132.16 → 5132.96] bring?
[5133.84 → 5134.50] The point
[5134.50 → 5135.18] here that
[5135.18 → 5136.00] brings Paul
[5136.00 → 5136.70] to worship
[5136.70 → 5137.34] is the
[5137.34 → 5138.50] riches of
[5138.50 → 5139.30] the magnitude
[5139.30 → 5139.98] of God's
[5139.98 → 5140.58] plan for
[5140.58 → 5141.58] redemption,
[5141.82 → 5142.46] for salvation.
[5143.42 → 5143.64] And it
[5143.64 → 5144.42] makes him
[5144.42 → 5145.22] worthy of
[5145.22 → 5145.58] praise,
[5145.68 → 5146.20] makes God
[5146.20 → 5146.88] worthy of
[5146.88 → 5147.14] praise.
[5147.58 → 5148.72] The scope
[5148.72 → 5149.32] of God's
[5149.32 → 5149.76] mercy,
[5149.88 → 5150.30] the scope
[5150.30 → 5150.78] of God's
[5150.78 → 5151.22] redemption,
[5151.60 → 5152.66] it is so
[5152.66 → 5154.24] massive and
[5154.24 → 5155.54] the majesty
[5155.54 → 5156.20] of it just
[5156.20 → 5157.52] makes Paul
[5157.52 → 5158.38] sing.
[5159.70 → 5160.14] He sings
[5160.14 → 5160.64] about whom
[5160.64 → 5161.40] God is.
[5162.68 → 5163.28] The depths
[5163.28 → 5163.74] of the
[5163.74 → 5164.20] riches of
[5164.20 → 5164.68] God make
[5164.68 → 5165.20] him worthy
[5165.20 → 5165.82] of our
[5165.82 → 5166.20] praise.
[5166.40 → 5167.02] The depths
[5167.02 → 5167.46] of the
[5167.46 → 5167.92] riches of
[5167.92 → 5168.52] the wisdom
[5168.52 → 5169.14] of God,
[5169.24 → 5170.42] his omniscience
[5170.42 → 5170.98] make him
[5170.98 → 5171.74] worthy of
[5171.74 → 5172.18] praise.
[5173.64 → 5174.64] It's his
[5174.64 → 5175.90] wisdom and
[5175.90 → 5176.64] his knowledge,
[5176.94 → 5177.74] his omniscience
[5177.74 → 5178.48] that in part
[5178.48 → 5179.42] make God
[5179.42 → 5179.82] God.
[5180.30 → 5180.98] They're
[5180.98 → 5181.70] characteristics
[5181.70 → 5182.68] of his
[5182.68 → 5183.84] Goddess.
[5186.52 → 5187.48] What we
[5187.48 → 5187.78] begin to
[5187.78 → 5188.36] see is
[5188.36 → 5189.74] that right
[5189.74 → 5190.74] doxology,
[5191.72 → 5192.36] right worship,
[5192.88 → 5193.70] requires
[5193.70 → 5195.58] right theology.
[5196.58 → 5197.12] Worship
[5197.12 → 5198.42] exalts in
[5198.42 → 5199.12] who God
[5199.12 → 5199.96] is and
[5199.96 → 5200.58] what God
[5200.58 → 5201.42] does,
[5201.52 → 5201.74] but it
[5201.74 → 5202.68] is only
[5202.68 → 5203.22] God's
[5203.22 → 5203.78] revelation
[5203.78 → 5204.62] of himself
[5204.62 → 5205.22] then that
[5205.22 → 5205.90] can inform
[5205.90 → 5206.84] our worship
[5206.84 → 5207.62] of God's
[5207.62 → 5208.08] self.
[5208.08 → 5208.90] right?
[5208.94 → 5209.20] If we
[5209.20 → 5210.18] begin to
[5210.18 → 5210.62] substitute
[5210.62 → 5211.32] personal
[5211.32 → 5212.04] experience
[5212.04 → 5212.38] in the
[5212.38 → 5212.80] place of
[5212.80 → 5212.90] an
[5212.90 → 5213.44] experience
[5213.44 → 5214.08] of God,
[5214.72 → 5215.76] we miss
[5215.76 → 5216.34] and are
[5216.34 → 5216.70] missing
[5216.70 → 5217.58] true worship
[5217.58 → 5218.86] and therefore,
[5219.32 → 5219.80] in line with
[5219.80 → 5220.48] my thesis
[5220.48 → 5220.94] for you this
[5220.94 → 5221.22] morning,
[5221.64 → 5221.92] we are
[5221.92 → 5222.28] missing
[5222.28 → 5223.12] our true
[5223.12 → 5223.78] humanity.
[5225.46 → 5225.74] Worship
[5225.74 → 5226.90] is exalting
[5226.90 → 5227.34] in whom
[5227.34 → 5228.02] God is
[5228.02 → 5228.66] and what
[5228.66 → 5229.10] God
[5229.10 → 5229.88] has
[5229.88 → 5230.50] done.
[5230.50 → 5231.50] God
[5231.50 → 5232.26] is
[5232.26 → 5232.58] the second
[5232.58 → 5232.98] thing to
[5232.98 → 5234.32] see from
[5234.32 → 5234.84] Paul's
[5234.84 → 5235.56] doxology
[5235.56 → 5237.52] is that
[5237.52 → 5238.44] right worship
[5238.44 → 5240.32] will involve,
[5240.48 → 5241.10] necessarily
[5241.10 → 5241.98] involves,
[5242.54 → 5243.06] mystery.
[5244.14 → 5244.40] At the
[5244.40 → 5245.18] second part
[5245.18 → 5245.58] of verse
[5245.58 → 5246.08] 33,
[5246.72 → 5247.16] Paul says
[5247.16 → 5248.54] how unsearchable
[5248.54 → 5249.36] his judgments
[5249.36 → 5250.16] and his
[5250.16 → 5251.30] path beyond
[5251.30 → 5252.44] tracing out.
[5253.80 → 5254.44] The reality
[5254.44 → 5254.74] here,
[5254.78 → 5254.94] right,
[5255.00 → 5255.62] is that if
[5255.62 → 5256.12] we are
[5256.12 → 5256.82] worshipping
[5256.82 → 5257.30] the true
[5257.30 → 5258.16] God as
[5258.16 → 5258.58] he is
[5258.58 → 5259.26] revealed in
[5259.26 → 5259.74] the Bible,
[5259.74 → 5260.78] that also
[5260.78 → 5261.56] means there
[5261.56 → 5262.58] will necessarily
[5262.58 → 5263.60] be things
[5263.60 → 5264.36] about God
[5264.36 → 5265.04] that we
[5265.04 → 5265.50] cannot
[5265.50 → 5266.96] or do
[5266.96 → 5267.68] not and
[5267.68 → 5268.56] will never
[5268.56 → 5269.30] comprehend.
[5274.28 → 5275.26] If the
[5275.26 → 5275.88] God you
[5275.88 → 5276.44] worship
[5276.44 → 5277.56] makes sense
[5277.56 → 5278.02] to you,
[5278.98 → 5279.58] he is not
[5279.58 → 5279.88] God.
[5282.06 → 5282.30] Now,
[5283.30 → 5284.14] God wants
[5284.14 → 5284.84] to be known
[5284.84 → 5285.50] and he wants
[5285.50 → 5285.92] to make
[5285.92 → 5286.72] himself known
[5286.72 → 5287.10] and so
[5287.10 → 5287.90] what is
[5287.90 → 5288.78] necessary to
[5288.78 → 5289.20] be known
[5289.20 → 5289.66] about God
[5289.66 → 5290.18] can be
[5290.18 → 5290.82] known about
[5290.82 → 5291.04] him.
[5292.14 → 5292.88] But don't
[5292.88 → 5293.44] mistake what
[5293.44 → 5294.08] is necessary
[5294.08 → 5294.64] to be known
[5294.64 → 5295.12] about God
[5295.12 → 5295.44] for the
[5295.44 → 5296.40] whole of
[5296.40 → 5296.78] who God
[5296.78 → 5297.08] is.
[5300.40 → 5300.88] Now,
[5300.92 → 5301.24] this means
[5301.24 → 5302.60] a couple
[5302.60 → 5302.96] things.
[5305.56 → 5306.28] But most
[5306.28 → 5306.74] importantly,
[5307.14 → 5307.54] perhaps,
[5308.58 → 5309.52] it means
[5309.52 → 5311.10] that
[5311.10 → 5313.46] it is
[5313.46 → 5314.38] unreasonable
[5314.38 → 5315.70] God is
[5315.70 → 5316.16] for me
[5316.16 → 5316.90] to have
[5316.90 → 5316.92] to have
[5316.92 → 5316.94] to have
[5316.94 → 5318.66] an expectation
[5318.66 → 5319.64] that everything
[5319.64 → 5320.56] God does
[5320.56 → 5321.20] or everything
[5321.20 → 5322.38] God will
[5322.38 → 5323.12] do will
[5323.12 → 5323.76] make sense
[5323.76 → 5324.22] to me,
[5325.16 → 5325.82] will make
[5325.82 → 5326.56] sense to my
[5326.56 → 5327.26] experience,
[5327.26 → 5327.84] or will make
[5327.84 → 5328.40] sense to my
[5328.40 → 5328.72] brain.
[5330.80 → 5331.70] Some of us
[5331.70 → 5332.96] have been so
[5332.96 → 5333.80] angry with
[5333.80 → 5334.56] God because
[5334.56 → 5335.16] it doesn't make
[5335.16 → 5336.10] sense what
[5336.10 → 5336.70] he is doing
[5336.70 → 5337.36] or what he is
[5337.36 → 5337.98] not doing
[5337.98 → 5338.94] that we've just
[5338.94 → 5339.76] denied his
[5339.76 → 5340.52] existence as a
[5340.52 → 5340.78] result.
[5340.78 → 5341.10] But that
[5341.10 → 5341.74] rests on the
[5341.74 → 5342.72] idea that
[5342.72 → 5343.34] whatever God
[5343.34 → 5344.08] does have to
[5344.08 → 5344.50] make sense
[5344.50 → 5344.86] to me.
[5345.94 → 5346.60] But that's
[5346.60 → 5347.06] not the God
[5347.06 → 5347.54] of the Bible.
[5348.70 → 5349.68] It can't be
[5349.68 → 5350.92] that simple.
[5352.50 → 5353.10] And in fact,
[5353.62 → 5354.90] if we read
[5354.90 → 5355.56] the Bible from
[5355.56 → 5355.96] beginning to
[5355.96 → 5356.40] end, you
[5356.40 → 5356.80] have people
[5356.80 → 5357.52] like Job,
[5358.36 → 5358.76] right, who
[5358.76 → 5359.38] tried to
[5359.38 → 5359.84] think that
[5359.84 → 5360.18] way.
[5361.00 → 5361.40] And if you
[5361.40 → 5361.64] know the
[5361.64 → 5362.28] end of Job,
[5362.98 → 5363.86] sure changed.
[5364.38 → 5364.60] You have
[5364.60 → 5365.02] people like
[5365.02 → 5366.12] Habakkuk or
[5366.12 → 5367.32] Ezekiel who
[5367.32 → 5368.46] were overwhelmed
[5368.46 → 5369.58] by the mystery
[5369.58 → 5370.52] of this
[5370.52 → 5371.28] amazing God.
[5371.32 → 5371.68] Or you have
[5371.68 → 5372.10] people like
[5372.10 → 5372.54] Mary,
[5372.90 → 5373.58] blessed Mary,
[5373.82 → 5374.12] when the
[5374.12 → 5374.76] angel came to
[5374.76 → 5375.22] her and said
[5375.22 → 5375.68] this is going
[5375.68 → 5375.96] on, she
[5375.96 → 5376.50] said, how
[5376.50 → 5377.30] can this
[5377.30 → 5377.94] be?
[5379.46 → 5380.42] There will
[5380.42 → 5381.50] be a
[5381.50 → 5382.70] mystery in
[5382.70 → 5383.48] our experience
[5383.48 → 5384.28] of God and
[5384.28 → 5385.26] so there must
[5385.26 → 5386.68] be a mystery
[5386.68 → 5387.86] in our theology.
[5388.00 → 5388.34] There must be
[5388.34 → 5389.50] room for the
[5389.50 → 5390.06] mystery, for
[5390.06 → 5391.02] the unknown.
[5391.78 → 5392.12] And in fact,
[5392.54 → 5393.30] we participated
[5393.30 → 5394.48] in some of
[5394.48 → 5395.08] that mystery
[5395.08 → 5395.72] this morning
[5395.72 → 5396.46] in baptism.
[5397.60 → 5397.72] Right?
[5397.82 → 5398.80] Precisely how
[5398.80 → 5399.64] a sacrament
[5399.64 → 5400.96] is used by
[5400.96 → 5401.52] God as a
[5401.52 → 5401.96] means of
[5401.96 → 5402.84] grace, whether
[5402.84 → 5403.52] it's baptism
[5403.52 → 5404.28] in the water
[5404.28 → 5405.28] calling this
[5405.28 → 5406.30] child, beautiful
[5406.30 → 5407.24] Ava, into a
[5407.24 → 5408.04] covenant relationship
[5408.04 → 5408.88] with God, or
[5408.88 → 5409.76] whether next week
[5409.76 → 5410.34] when we come to
[5410.34 → 5411.06] the Lord's table
[5411.06 → 5412.08] it's the mystery
[5412.08 → 5412.70] of how the
[5412.70 → 5413.70] bread and the
[5413.70 → 5414.46] juice become
[5414.46 → 5415.32] for us the
[5415.32 → 5416.30] real spiritual
[5416.30 → 5417.20] presence of the
[5417.20 → 5417.90] body and blood
[5417.90 → 5418.42] of Jesus.
[5418.80 → 5420.04] These mysteries
[5420.04 → 5421.12] are necessary
[5421.12 → 5422.98] for us to
[5422.98 → 5423.84] engage and be
[5423.84 → 5425.52] engaged by God.
[5425.52 → 5425.54] God.
[5428.24 → 5428.94] And here's
[5428.94 → 5429.28] what I want
[5429.28 → 5429.78] you to hear
[5429.78 → 5431.80] because even
[5431.80 → 5432.48] as confusing
[5432.48 → 5432.86] and as
[5432.86 → 5433.58] difficult and
[5433.58 → 5435.46] as obfuscating
[5435.46 → 5436.04] as the
[5436.04 → 5436.76] mysteries of
[5436.76 → 5437.26] God are,
[5437.34 → 5437.96] and I use
[5437.96 → 5438.26] that word
[5438.26 → 5438.74] intentionally
[5438.74 → 5439.62] because the
[5439.62 → 5440.40] word obfuscate
[5440.40 → 5440.86] means to
[5440.86 → 5441.44] confuse and
[5441.44 → 5441.84] whenever you
[5441.84 → 5442.32] hear it you're
[5442.32 → 5442.92] confused about
[5442.92 → 5443.36] what the word
[5443.36 → 5443.74] means.
[5445.58 → 5446.40] These things
[5446.40 → 5447.30] are necessary
[5447.30 → 5448.24] for our
[5448.24 → 5449.46] worship to
[5449.46 → 5450.78] be genuine,
[5450.96 → 5451.64] both genuine
[5451.64 → 5452.32] in the sense
[5452.32 → 5453.08] of the
[5453.08 → 5453.76] worshipping of
[5453.76 → 5454.26] the one true
[5454.26 → 5454.98] God, but also
[5454.98 → 5455.70] genuine in the
[5455.70 → 5456.60] sense of this
[5456.60 → 5457.34] is me, all
[5457.34 → 5458.22] of who I am,
[5458.58 → 5459.32] questions and
[5459.32 → 5460.16] doubts and
[5460.16 → 5461.40] struggles alike
[5461.40 → 5462.36] in the presence
[5462.36 → 5463.52] of this God
[5463.52 → 5463.90] is.
[5464.16 → 5464.88] Because there is
[5464.88 → 5465.74] mystery in God
[5465.74 → 5466.56] that means we
[5466.56 → 5467.24] can bring our
[5467.24 → 5468.36] doubts and our
[5468.36 → 5469.34] things unknown
[5469.34 → 5470.68] and the things
[5470.68 → 5471.84] unknown of our
[5471.84 → 5472.72] lives and of our
[5472.72 → 5473.84] stories into the
[5473.84 → 5475.06] relationship that
[5475.06 → 5475.90] we have with God,
[5475.98 → 5476.60] into the very
[5476.60 → 5478.10] worship of whom
[5478.10 → 5479.08] God is.
[5479.56 → 5480.52] Having doubts
[5480.52 → 5481.80] and being amazed
[5481.80 → 5482.46] at the mysteries
[5482.46 → 5483.74] of faith is not
[5483.76 → 5484.76] a weak faith,
[5484.88 → 5485.70] it is an act
[5485.70 → 5486.58] of faith.
[5487.74 → 5488.66] The journey of
[5488.66 → 5489.26] faith for the
[5489.26 → 5490.22] Christian and
[5490.22 → 5491.52] of discipleship is
[5491.52 → 5492.32] faith-seeking
[5492.32 → 5493.68] understanding, yes
[5493.68 → 5494.94] and amen, but it
[5494.94 → 5496.76] is also faith-seeking
[5496.76 → 5497.40] humility.
[5498.66 → 5499.92] It is a faith-seeking
[5499.92 → 5500.88] a right recognition
[5500.88 → 5501.82] of who God is
[5501.82 → 5502.68] and what that means
[5502.68 → 5503.40] for my willingness
[5503.40 → 5504.70] to accept and
[5504.70 → 5505.88] to worship in the
[5505.88 → 5506.48] midst of those
[5506.48 → 5507.14] things that I do
[5507.14 → 5508.78] not know, in the
[5508.78 → 5509.22] midst of those
[5509.22 → 5509.68] things that I
[5509.68 → 5510.60] cannot understand.
[5510.60 → 5511.60] faith-seeking
[5511.60 → 5513.84] and let me be
[5513.84 → 5515.64] really clear about
[5515.64 → 5516.12] this then.
[5517.22 → 5519.66] Far from rejecting
[5519.66 → 5521.42] your doubts, far
[5521.42 → 5523.56] from ignoring your
[5523.56 → 5524.78] doubts, far from
[5524.78 → 5525.96] trying to bury them
[5525.96 → 5527.46] deep within us and
[5527.46 → 5528.68] not being a place
[5528.68 → 5529.42] here where we can
[5529.42 → 5530.22] talk about them and
[5530.22 → 5531.44] engage them and hold
[5531.44 → 5532.24] them up and ask
[5532.24 → 5533.46] questions and bring
[5533.46 → 5534.22] them into the light,
[5534.54 → 5535.72] far from that, right
[5535.72 → 5537.46] worship is precisely
[5537.46 → 5538.82] the place to bring
[5538.82 → 5539.36] your doubts.
[5540.52 → 5541.22] Right worship is
[5541.22 → 5542.30] precisely the place
[5542.30 → 5543.86] to enter into the
[5543.86 → 5546.12] things unknown as
[5546.12 → 5546.92] we're met by God
[5546.92 → 5547.56] here.
[5548.52 → 5549.58] In fact, this moves
[5549.58 → 5550.54] us right into the
[5550.54 → 5551.74] third thing to see
[5551.74 → 5553.24] from Paul's doxology
[5553.24 → 5555.44] that helps us inform
[5555.44 → 5556.90] our worship together.
[5557.60 → 5559.72] Paul himself brings
[5559.72 → 5560.54] his questions.
[5561.54 → 5562.64] You notice in verse
[5562.64 → 5564.80] 34 and 35 he's
[5564.80 → 5565.46] asking questions.
[5566.28 → 5567.12] Who has known the
[5567.12 → 5568.00] mind of the Lord or
[5568.00 → 5568.94] who has been his
[5568.94 → 5569.36] counsellor?
[5569.86 → 5570.78] Who has ever given
[5570.78 → 5571.82] to God that God
[5571.82 → 5572.64] should repay them?
[5573.44 → 5574.10] If you have
[5574.10 → 5575.36] questions, bring them
[5575.36 → 5577.76] to worship because
[5577.76 → 5579.22] we are thinking
[5579.22 → 5579.76] creatures.
[5580.32 → 5580.94] We will have
[5580.94 → 5581.44] questions.
[5581.58 → 5582.30] We will have
[5582.30 → 5583.00] doubts.
[5583.44 → 5585.28] In fact, I
[5585.28 → 5586.36] mentioned Descartes
[5586.36 → 5587.40] earlier, his famous
[5587.40 → 5588.64] line, bonito ergo
[5588.64 → 5588.92] sum.
[5589.78 → 5591.22] Later in life, in a
[5591.22 → 5592.86] posthumously published
[5592.86 → 5594.14] essay that he wrote,
[5594.46 → 5596.12] he actually expands that
[5596.12 → 5597.48] idea, and he says,
[5597.86 → 5599.50] I doubt, therefore I
[5599.50 → 5601.84] think, and so I am.
[5603.38 → 5604.66] Ask your questions.
[5605.52 → 5606.36] Have your doubts.
[5606.80 → 5607.90] Wrestle with them and
[5607.90 → 5609.92] bring them into the
[5609.92 → 5611.90] place where God is.
[5612.52 → 5613.86] Having doubts, asking
[5613.86 → 5615.40] questions is part of what
[5615.40 → 5617.00] it means to be human.
[5618.00 → 5619.98] And so it also needs to
[5619.98 → 5621.48] be part of what it means
[5621.48 → 5623.62] to encounter God in
[5623.62 → 5624.44] worship.
[5625.82 → 5626.94] Now it's also worth
[5626.94 → 5628.50] noting that these two
[5628.50 → 5629.52] questions that Paul
[5629.52 → 5631.32] asks are quotes from
[5631.32 → 5632.60] Old Testament passages.
[5633.46 → 5634.90] The first question in
[5634.90 → 5636.32] verse 34 is a quote
[5636.32 → 5637.78] from Isaiah 40 verse
[5637.78 → 5641.88] 13 from the Greek
[5641.88 → 5643.12] translation of the Old
[5643.12 → 5644.00] Testament and then the
[5644.00 → 5645.70] next one is from Job
[5645.70 → 5647.48] 41 verse 11.
[5647.48 → 5650.32] Now these questions
[5650.32 → 5652.12] themselves are an
[5652.12 → 5654.06] exalting of who God
[5654.06 → 5654.48] is.
[5655.82 → 5656.60] So hold those two
[5656.60 → 5657.08] things together.
[5657.26 → 5658.94] Questions are welcome
[5658.94 → 5660.28] and are necessary in the
[5660.28 → 5661.08] life of the believer,
[5661.38 → 5663.06] but our questions must
[5663.06 → 5664.94] also be brought under
[5664.94 → 5667.26] the perspective of
[5667.26 → 5668.40] God's word.
[5669.58 → 5671.10] Paul uses scripture to
[5671.10 → 5672.10] speak his questions,
[5672.30 → 5672.86] but then he also
[5672.86 → 5674.90] submits his questions to
[5674.90 → 5676.26] the rule of scripture.
[5676.26 → 5678.76] And so in our worship
[5678.76 → 5680.30] we submit ourselves to
[5680.30 → 5681.22] the rule of scripture.
[5681.34 → 5682.68] That's why the preached
[5682.68 → 5683.96] word is in many
[5683.96 → 5685.18] respects the culmination
[5685.18 → 5686.02] of our worship
[5686.02 → 5687.12] experiences together.
[5687.58 → 5688.74] Not because I'm any
[5688.74 → 5689.60] good at this job,
[5690.42 → 5691.84] but because God is
[5691.84 → 5693.18] good, and he is
[5693.18 → 5694.60] faithful, and he has
[5694.60 → 5695.66] revealed himself in
[5695.66 → 5697.02] this way to us.
[5697.54 → 5698.40] This is where God
[5698.40 → 5699.86] speaks to our hearts
[5699.86 → 5700.72] and to our minds.
[5700.84 → 5701.66] This is where in
[5701.66 → 5703.22] chapter 12 we will see
[5703.22 → 5704.26] he does the transforming
[5704.82 → 5706.24] of our minds by the
[5706.24 → 5708.24] renewing and work
[5708.24 → 5709.22] of the Holy Spirit.
[5709.38 → 5710.96] This is what shapes
[5710.96 → 5712.28] our spiritual acts
[5712.28 → 5713.26] of worship as we
[5713.26 → 5714.24] leave this place
[5714.24 → 5715.08] together.
[5716.76 → 5718.12] Which then brings us
[5718.12 → 5719.46] to the fourth thing
[5719.46 → 5722.10] in this doxology
[5722.10 → 5723.54] of Paul that informs
[5723.54 → 5725.14] our worship.
[5727.66 → 5729.72] Doxology requires
[5729.72 → 5731.54] humble submission
[5731.54 → 5733.06] salvation before the
[5733.06 → 5734.22] throne of God.
[5735.28 → 5736.20] Verse 36.
[5737.20 → 5737.82] Paul says,
[5738.36 → 5739.12] For from him
[5739.12 → 5740.10] and through him
[5740.10 → 5741.28] and for him
[5741.28 → 5743.24] are all things.
[5744.68 → 5745.58] So where does
[5745.58 → 5746.38] everything come from?
[5747.00 → 5747.78] It comes from him,
[5748.08 → 5748.32] God.
[5748.88 → 5749.92] How does everything
[5749.92 → 5750.58] come to be?
[5751.00 → 5751.58] Through him,
[5751.90 → 5752.18] God.
[5752.66 → 5753.50] Why does everything
[5753.50 → 5753.84] exist?
[5753.96 → 5754.70] Who is it for?
[5754.92 → 5755.70] It's for him,
[5756.08 → 5756.40] God.
[5756.40 → 5756.48] God.
[5757.48 → 5758.46] And so really
[5758.46 → 5759.04] practically,
[5760.48 → 5765.42] if it has become
[5765.42 → 5767.94] commonplace for you
[5767.94 → 5769.24] after worship
[5769.24 → 5770.36] to say something
[5770.36 → 5770.78] like,
[5771.38 → 5772.50] I didn't get anything
[5772.50 → 5773.54] out of worship today
[5773.54 → 5774.94] or I didn't get
[5774.94 → 5775.76] anything out of the
[5775.76 → 5776.50] service today,
[5776.86 → 5777.82] I want to challenge
[5777.82 → 5779.38] you with Paul's call
[5779.38 → 5780.24] to humble submission.
[5780.60 → 5781.70] And I want to reframe
[5781.70 → 5782.64] the question for you.
[5783.60 → 5784.52] Instead of saying,
[5784.66 → 5785.30] I didn't get anything
[5785.30 → 5785.80] out of worship,
[5785.94 → 5786.78] I want you to ask,
[5786.96 → 5788.42] what did I give to God
[5788.42 → 5789.22] during worship?
[5791.48 → 5792.92] What did I give to God
[5792.92 → 5793.86] when the fellowship
[5793.86 → 5794.64] of the saints
[5794.64 → 5795.52] gathered together,
[5795.62 → 5796.54] when the body of Jesus
[5796.54 → 5797.48] Christ came together?
[5797.64 → 5799.06] What did I bring to him?
[5803.78 → 5804.54] And I don't think
[5804.54 → 5805.54] it's too strong to say,
[5805.80 → 5807.42] if you reframe
[5807.42 → 5808.38] that question
[5808.38 → 5810.02] and if you shape
[5810.02 → 5810.82] your entrance
[5810.82 → 5811.98] into this sanctuary
[5811.98 → 5813.20] as you come through
[5813.20 → 5813.72] those doors
[5813.72 → 5814.48] every morning,
[5814.76 → 5815.34] every Sunday
[5815.34 → 5815.76] by saying,
[5815.86 → 5816.76] what can I bring to you
[5816.76 → 5817.44] in worship today,
[5817.52 → 5817.74] God?
[5818.84 → 5820.00] I can promise
[5820.00 → 5821.22] that will begin
[5821.22 → 5822.42] to work in you
[5822.42 → 5823.72] and that will change
[5823.72 → 5824.82] what you get
[5824.82 → 5825.74] out of worship.
[5827.10 → 5828.14] Because you have
[5828.14 → 5829.28] changed your posture
[5829.28 → 5830.48] in entering into
[5830.48 → 5830.98] this place
[5830.98 → 5831.34] and saying,
[5831.54 → 5832.12] it is about
[5832.12 → 5833.06] who God is
[5833.06 → 5834.24] and exalting him
[5834.24 → 5835.08] and so I am going
[5835.08 → 5836.02] to give myself
[5836.02 → 5837.02] to him.
[5839.82 → 5840.30] Worship,
[5840.56 → 5840.80] right?
[5840.80 → 5842.34] Worship gives you
[5842.34 → 5843.32] a right perspective
[5843.32 → 5844.12] on God
[5844.12 → 5845.46] which then in turn
[5845.46 → 5846.46] gives you a right
[5846.46 → 5847.66] perspective on yourself.
[5848.84 → 5850.04] That's why the glory
[5850.04 → 5851.10] of God is the human
[5851.10 → 5852.16] being fully alive.
[5852.30 → 5853.04] That's why the
[5853.04 → 5853.90] Westminster Shorter
[5853.90 → 5854.96] Catechism puts it
[5854.96 → 5856.20] in this way.
[5856.32 → 5857.32] It asks,
[5857.44 → 5858.36] what is the chief
[5858.36 → 5860.20] end of every person?
[5861.50 → 5862.30] And the answer is
[5862.30 → 5863.74] to glorify God
[5863.74 → 5865.38] and enjoy him
[5865.38 → 5866.56] forever.
[5866.56 → 5866.66] forever.
[5870.30 → 5870.82] Now,
[5871.22 → 5873.12] we would miss
[5873.12 → 5874.76] the majesty
[5874.76 → 5876.86] of this humble
[5876.86 → 5877.52] submission.
[5878.60 → 5879.52] We would miss
[5879.52 → 5880.20] the majesty
[5880.20 → 5881.32] of whom this God
[5881.32 → 5882.48] is if we did
[5882.48 → 5883.76] not also notice
[5883.76 → 5884.92] that what Paul
[5884.92 → 5885.44] says here,
[5885.54 → 5886.10] for from him
[5886.10 → 5886.64] and through him
[5886.64 → 5887.26] and for him
[5887.26 → 5888.00] are all things,
[5888.06 → 5888.94] to him be the glory
[5888.94 → 5889.40] forever.
[5889.80 → 5890.78] What Paul says here
[5890.78 → 5893.16] sounds to my ear
[5893.16 → 5895.38] so much like
[5895.38 → 5896.24] what Paul writes
[5896.24 → 5897.38] in Colossians 1.
[5898.04 → 5898.92] Colossians 1,
[5899.00 → 5900.06] 16 and 17,
[5900.66 → 5901.32] Paul says,
[5901.84 → 5903.06] now of Jesus
[5903.06 → 5904.94] all things
[5904.94 → 5905.88] have been created
[5905.88 → 5906.72] through him
[5906.72 → 5908.02] and for him.
[5908.10 → 5908.86] He is before
[5908.86 → 5909.58] all things
[5909.58 → 5910.54] and in him
[5910.54 → 5911.52] all things
[5911.52 → 5912.72] hold together.
[5913.92 → 5914.96] That text in Colossians
[5914.96 → 5915.80] is about Jesus
[5915.80 → 5917.10] and yet you see
[5917.10 → 5918.24] how remarkably
[5918.24 → 5920.04] similar it is
[5920.04 → 5920.58] to what Paul
[5920.58 → 5921.16] says here.
[5921.76 → 5922.74] And in Colossians,
[5923.16 → 5924.14] Paul goes through
[5924.14 → 5925.12] this amazing
[5925.12 → 5926.36] Christ hymn
[5926.36 → 5927.52] exalting Jesus
[5927.52 → 5928.20] saying that
[5928.20 → 5929.60] he is the image
[5929.60 → 5931.28] of the invisible God
[5931.28 → 5931.76] saying that
[5931.76 → 5932.96] God chose to have
[5932.96 → 5933.56] the fullness
[5933.56 → 5934.62] of who he is
[5934.62 → 5936.32] dwell in Jesus
[5936.32 → 5937.32] that in all things
[5937.32 → 5938.54] Christ might have
[5938.54 → 5939.16] the supremacy.
[5940.16 → 5940.82] And so when we
[5940.82 → 5941.86] gather in this place
[5941.86 → 5942.72] and we talk about
[5942.72 → 5943.50] what does it mean
[5943.50 → 5944.42] to be fully human,
[5944.78 → 5945.54] fully alive,
[5945.86 → 5946.98] we must look to Jesus.
[5947.88 → 5948.56] When we gather
[5948.56 → 5949.10] in this place
[5949.10 → 5949.66] and we talk about
[5949.66 → 5950.24] what does it mean
[5950.24 → 5951.32] to worship God,
[5951.50 → 5952.60] we must look to Jesus.
[5952.74 → 5953.76] who is God
[5953.76 → 5954.36] and made himself
[5954.36 → 5955.32] known to us,
[5955.54 → 5956.40] made himself visible
[5956.40 → 5956.94] to us.
[5957.06 → 5957.80] When we gather
[5957.80 → 5958.66] in this place
[5958.66 → 5959.72] to worship God
[5959.72 → 5960.66] and to wrestle
[5960.66 → 5962.04] with our humanity,
[5962.04 → 5963.22] we must see
[5963.22 → 5963.98] the humility
[5963.98 → 5965.00] of God himself
[5965.00 → 5965.48] in Jesus
[5965.48 → 5967.20] who took on
[5967.20 → 5967.74] the form
[5967.74 → 5968.56] of a slave
[5968.56 → 5969.96] and being found
[5969.96 → 5971.54] in human likeness
[5971.54 → 5972.44] became obedient
[5972.44 → 5973.52] unto death,
[5973.64 → 5974.42] even death
[5974.42 → 5975.52] on the cross.
[5976.12 → 5976.42] You see,
[5976.52 → 5977.42] this is who
[5977.42 → 5978.28] God is.
[5978.28 → 5979.06] This is what
[5979.06 → 5979.94] God has done.
[5980.04 → 5980.74] This is why
[5980.74 → 5981.92] we exalt in him
[5981.92 → 5982.86] because Jesus,
[5983.28 → 5983.96] God himself,
[5984.12 → 5985.04] came into this world
[5985.04 → 5985.94] and lived the life
[5985.94 → 5986.94] I should have lived
[5986.94 → 5987.90] and died the death
[5987.90 → 5989.06] that I deserve.
[5989.20 → 5990.34] And so now
[5990.34 → 5991.48] I see the truth
[5991.48 → 5992.50] of who I am
[5992.50 → 5994.10] revealed in the truth
[5994.10 → 5995.84] of who Jesus is
[5995.84 → 5997.64] and so I will
[5997.64 → 5999.08] praise him.
[5999.08 → 6002.52] worship is about
[6002.52 → 6003.52] Jesus.
[6007.22 → 6008.46] And then the last word.
[6009.88 → 6010.90] The last word.
[6011.06 → 6011.90] To him be the glory
[6011.90 → 6012.38] forever.
[6013.72 → 6014.10] Amen.
[6015.38 → 6015.76] Amen.
[6016.66 → 6017.40] Now let me be
[6017.40 → 6018.80] real quick on this.
[6018.96 → 6020.64] Amen is a word
[6020.64 → 6021.46] that means
[6021.46 → 6022.02] trustworthy
[6022.02 → 6023.30] or true.
[6024.62 → 6025.18] Colloquially,
[6025.60 → 6026.90] it's like when you
[6026.90 → 6027.74] or your friends
[6027.74 → 6028.48] say something
[6028.48 → 6029.48] that you agree with
[6029.48 → 6030.08] or that you think
[6030.08 → 6030.64] is important
[6030.64 → 6031.72] and if you're
[6031.72 → 6032.30] a millennial
[6032.30 → 6032.78] you might have
[6032.78 → 6033.22] said something
[6033.22 → 6033.86] like truth.
[6035.08 → 6035.92] If you're
[6035.92 → 6036.84] younger than
[6036.84 → 6037.34] a millennial
[6037.34 → 6037.86] you might say
[6037.86 → 6038.38] something like
[6038.38 → 6038.84] facts.
[6041.28 → 6042.22] In the Jewish
[6042.22 → 6043.24] synagogue tradition
[6043.24 → 6045.28] then carried over
[6045.28 → 6046.36] into early Christianity
[6046.36 → 6047.62] when someone
[6047.62 → 6048.78] finished reading
[6048.78 → 6050.16] or giving a discourse
[6050.16 → 6051.36] or had offered
[6051.36 → 6052.26] a powerful prayer
[6052.26 → 6052.90] to God
[6052.90 → 6054.10] the other people
[6054.10 → 6054.92] in the assembly
[6054.92 → 6055.94] would respond
[6055.94 → 6056.76] by saying
[6056.76 → 6057.22] amen.
[6057.74 → 6058.66] And the idea
[6058.66 → 6059.34] there is that
[6059.34 → 6059.80] it takes
[6059.80 → 6060.40] what was just
[6060.40 → 6060.76] said
[6060.76 → 6061.42] and it makes
[6061.42 → 6062.20] it your own.
[6063.18 → 6063.82] So when you
[6063.82 → 6064.58] say amen
[6064.58 → 6065.48] it takes the
[6065.48 → 6065.98] truth
[6065.98 → 6067.32] that I am
[6067.32 → 6067.70] saying
[6067.70 → 6068.24] or that the
[6068.24 → 6068.82] speaker is
[6068.82 → 6069.20] saying
[6069.20 → 6069.72] and it
[6069.72 → 6070.56] proclaims it
[6070.56 → 6071.10] for yourself
[6071.10 → 6071.84] saying yes
[6071.84 → 6073.12] this is mine.
[6073.90 → 6074.68] It's like you
[6074.68 → 6075.34] saying yes
[6075.34 → 6075.80] Lord
[6075.80 → 6077.18] this is
[6077.18 → 6077.64] true
[6077.64 → 6078.28] make it
[6078.28 → 6078.82] so
[6078.82 → 6079.64] for me.
[6082.26 → 6083.26] You got it.
[6084.40 → 6085.12] Remember at the
[6085.12 → 6085.52] beginning of the
[6085.52 → 6086.12] service I said
[6086.12 → 6086.80] at some point
[6086.80 → 6087.20] you will have
[6087.20 → 6087.64] a voluntary
[6087.64 → 6088.20] participation.
[6088.80 → 6089.56] This is your
[6089.56 → 6090.46] perhaps less than
[6090.46 → 6091.40] voluntary participation
[6091.40 → 6091.92] point.
[6093.78 → 6094.08] Worship
[6094.08 → 6095.38] exalts God.
[6095.48 → 6095.64] Amen?
[6097.26 → 6098.54] Worship celebrates
[6098.54 → 6099.18] the mystery
[6099.18 → 6099.86] and has room
[6099.86 → 6100.60] for your doubts.
[6102.06 → 6103.26] Worship invites
[6103.26 → 6103.96] your questions
[6103.96 → 6104.86] and calls you
[6104.86 → 6105.70] to submit them
[6105.70 → 6106.36] to the scriptures.
[6108.46 → 6109.24] That's a harder
[6109.24 → 6109.80] one, isn't it?
[6109.80 → 6111.92] And worship
[6111.92 → 6113.20] requires humble
[6113.20 → 6113.84] submission
[6113.84 → 6115.86] seeing yourself
[6115.86 → 6116.58] as you truly
[6116.58 → 6117.58] are before God.
[6118.76 → 6119.74] And worship
[6119.74 → 6120.66] says that we
[6120.66 → 6121.10] will hear
[6121.10 → 6122.06] these truths
[6122.06 → 6123.24] of God
[6123.24 → 6123.88] and we
[6123.88 → 6124.78] will say
[6124.78 → 6125.82] amen.
[6126.28 → 6126.98] Let's pray
[6126.98 → 6127.34] together.
[6132.72 → 6133.44] Amen
[6133.44 → 6135.08] and amen.
[6135.08 → 6137.20] God you
[6137.20 → 6138.10] are good.
[6138.22 → 6138.72] Who you
[6138.72 → 6140.00] are is
[6140.00 → 6140.74] amazing
[6140.74 → 6142.14] to us
[6142.14 → 6142.46] and so
[6142.46 → 6143.44] we exalt
[6143.44 → 6145.06] your name.
[6146.94 → 6147.42] Who you
