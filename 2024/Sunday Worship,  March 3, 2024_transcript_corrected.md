[348.24 → 349.00] How are we doing?
[350.70 → 351.22] Awesome.
[351.42 → 353.26] Thank you for being here.
[353.36 → 356.16] A special welcome to you if you're a guest among us.
[356.32 → 357.14] My name is Chris.
[357.14 → 362.90] I'm one of the pastors here, and it's my privilege, along with these others on stage and a few
[362.90 → 367.70] that we haven't yet revealed to you, to lead in our worship together this morning.
[368.02 → 372.96] Before we begin in worship, there are a couple of announcements to make and to share with you.
[372.96 → 380.04] First, a huge thank you to everyone who came out to the Mexico Mission dinner and fundraiser
[380.04 → 381.36] last night that was here.
[381.36 → 389.50] The dessert auction is always a ton of fun, even if my son goes home sad every time because
[389.50 → 392.76] we just don't have enough money to pay the way you guys pay for desserts.
[393.50 → 396.90] So thank you for your generosity in that on behalf of the team.
[397.40 → 400.06] It's really an amazing time to be together.
[400.90 → 402.70] As well, one last announcement.
[403.34 → 405.74] Youth Coffee is happening after church.
[405.74 → 412.90] And so if you're a youth that's sort of grade 8 to high school aged and would like to go
[412.90 → 417.40] to someone's house for coffee after church, you can get details from Pastor Kevin about
[417.40 → 417.72] that.
[418.14 → 420.58] You're heading to the Baumann's, so Rob is over there.
[420.64 → 422.18] He can give you details on how to get there.
[423.02 → 427.46] And if you have any questions, grab either one of them and they will address them.
[428.06 → 429.70] I think that's it for this morning.
[430.04 → 433.22] And so I'm going to invite you, as you're able and where you are, to stand.
[433.22 → 438.04] And we can be welcomed into God's presence by receiving his greeting.
[440.16 → 445.14] After we receive the greeting of God, I invite you to turn to those around you and welcome
[445.14 → 446.64] them into worship.
[447.34 → 451.06] Just a reminder that not everyone wants to shake hands or give hugs.
[451.32 → 460.98] And so gauge the person across from you intentionally as you offer your hand or a fist bump or a head
[460.98 → 461.28] nod.
[461.68 → 462.98] Either way is appropriate.
[463.22 → 465.18] To welcome each other into worship.
[465.46 → 467.18] Receive the greeting of our God.
[469.00 → 472.18] Grace, mercy, and peace to you.
[472.52 → 477.40] From God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, His Son and our Saviour, through the presence
[477.40 → 479.24] and power of the Holy Spirit.
[480.30 → 480.72] Amen.
[482.20 → 483.26] Greet those around you.
[484.96 → 485.68] Good morning.
[493.22 → 515.82] Hear these words from Psalm 8 and tune your hearts to worship our Lord and King.
[515.82 → 520.30] Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth.
[520.60 → 522.74] You have set your glory in the heavens.
[523.28 → 527.78] Through the praise of children and infants, you have established a stronghold against your
[527.78 → 530.20] enemies to silence the foe and the avenger.
[530.70 → 534.78] When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars which you have
[534.78 → 538.22] set in place, what is mankind that you are mindful of them?
[538.48 → 540.20] Human beings that you care for them.
[540.20 → 545.22] You have made them a little lower than the angels and crowned them with glory and honour.
[545.94 → 548.22] You made them rulers over the works of your hands.
[548.60 → 554.06] You put everything under their feet, all flocks and herds, and all the animals of the wild,
[554.24 → 559.34] and the birds in the sky, and the fish in the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas.
[559.34 → 563.48] Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth.
[563.48 → 569.52] blood, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth.

[874.42 → 878.42] is
[878.42 → 880.78] we give in to fear because of the state of our world.
[881.32 → 883.70] We forget that you have authority over everything,
[884.06 → 885.64] every nation, every leader.
[886.16 → 888.96] You have kingdom authority, and you are sovereign in every act.
[889.50 → 893.52] We forget your authority and crown ourselves as king in our own lives.
[894.22 → 896.02] As we walk through the season of Lent,
[896.38 → 898.64] we look to the cross, and we think of your disciples,
[899.32 → 901.66] pondering how they must have felt at the crucifixion.
[902.12 → 903.84] Why did Jesus have to die?
[904.38 → 907.26] Why did their leader, their teacher, their friend,
[907.26 → 910.04] allow the authorities of this earth to crucify him?
[910.64 → 912.46] What king dies on the path to victory?
[913.34 → 916.76] God, we come to the cross, humbly offering our fears,
[917.30 → 920.44] humbly laying down our visions of what your glory and authority
[920.44 → 921.76] should look like on this earth,
[922.38 → 925.02] humbly giving up our self-proclaimed crowns.
[926.24 → 929.92] We come to the cross, recognizing our need to trust you,
[930.48 → 932.10] yielding to the mystery of your working,
[932.76 → 935.80] seeking your mercy and grace for our sin and for our weakness.
[935.80 → 938.54] Jesus, we come before you,
[938.96 → 943.04] journeying towards and kneeling at the cross in confession and in worship.
[943.04 → 945.04] Wow.
[945.70 → 946.00] Yes.
[946.00 → 946.70] Amen.
[946.70 → 947.00] Amen.
[947.22 → 947.54] Amen.
[947.54 → 947.86] Amen.

[949.76 → 951.78] Amen.
[954.24 → 954.32] Amen.
[954.32 → 954.68] Amen.
[954.68 → 956.50] Amen.
[956.50 → 957.88] Yes.

[967.76 → 968.52] Amen.
[970.70 → 971.10] Amen.
[971.10 → 988.22] I come to the cross seeking mercy and grace. I come to the cross where you died in my place.
[988.22 → 1001.82] Out of my weakness and into strength, only I come to the cross.
[1003.28 → 1016.22] Your arms are open, you call me my name. You love this child that was lost.
[1016.22 → 1037.14] You lay a price for my guilt and my shame. Jesus I come. Jesus I come. Jesus I come to the cross.
[1037.14 → 1052.42] I come to the cross seeking mercy and grace. I come to the cross where you died in my place.
[1052.42 → 1064.42] Out of my weakness and into your strength, only I come to the cross.
[1064.42 → 1078.42] Your arms are open, you call me my name. You love this child that was lost.
[1078.42 → 1093.42] You pay a price for my guilt and my shame. Jesus I come. Jesus I come.
[1093.42 → 1099.42] Jesus I come to the cross.
[1099.42 → 1101.42] I come to the cross.
[1101.42 → 1104.92] As you are able, let us stand together.
[1105.92 → 1107.68] Rise up, O people of God.
[1108.90 → 1114.68] Stand and declare your belief, as you have just sung that Christ died in our place.
[1114.68 → 1121.54] Speak these words with me from the Belgic Confession about the Atonement of Christ and believe it in your hearts.
[1121.54 → 1126.44] Remember the faithfulness of God, the pardon for sin, and a hope for tomorrow,
[1127.02 → 1130.50] because of the gift of faith in Christ Jesus, our Lord and Saviour.
[1130.50 → 1131.90] Together let's say,
[1131.90 → 1140.76] We believe that Jesus Christ is a high priest for ever and ever according to the Lord and the Lord and the Lord and the Lord and the Lord.
[1140.76 → 1148.18] He made such by an oath, and that he exempted himself in our name before his Father,
[1148.76 → 1152.44] to appease his Father's wrath with full satisfaction,
[1153.08 → 1156.32] by offering himself on the tree of the cross,
[1157.00 → 1161.50] and pouring out his precious blood for the cleansing of our sins,
[1161.90 → 1163.74] as the prophets had predicted.
[1164.70 → 1168.68] For it is written that what the punishment had made us whole
[1168.68 → 1171.08] was placed on the Son of God,
[1171.64 → 1174.50] and that by his cruises he had revealed.
[1175.04 → 1178.50] He was like the lamb that was led to the slaughter.
[1179.18 → 1181.64] He was numbered with the transgressors,
[1182.16 → 1185.16] and he began as a criminal like the Jesus Christ,
[1185.76 → 1188.66] though the Pilate had declared that he was innocent.
[1188.66 → 1192.38] So he gave back what he had not stolen,
[1192.90 → 1193.90] and he suffered,
[1194.32 → 1196.30] the righteous for the unrighteous,
[1196.80 → 1199.12] in both his body and his soul,
[1199.66 → 1205.44] in such a way that when he sensed the horrible punishment required by our sins,
[1206.12 → 1210.98] his sweat became like great cups of blood falling down on the ground.
[1211.52 → 1212.36] He cried,
[1212.36 → 1213.36] My God,
[1213.56 → 1214.32] My God,
[1214.32 → 1214.34] My God,
[1214.34 → 1214.36] My God,
[1214.36 → 1214.86] My God,
[1214.86 → 1216.52] Why have you forsaken me?
[1216.98 → 1220.78] And he endured all this for the forgiveness of our sins.
[1221.82 → 1222.50] Therefore,
[1222.86 → 1224.66] we rightly say with all,
[1225.16 → 1229.80] that we know nothing except Jesus Christ and the who crucified.
[1230.70 → 1233.04] We regard everything as lost,
[1233.36 → 1238.30] because of the surpassing value of knowing that Christ is our Lord.
[1238.30 → 1242.20] We find all our hurts in His wounds,
[1242.62 → 1248.96] and have no need to seek or invent any other means to reconcile ourselves with God,
[1249.50 → 1251.96] and this one and only sacrifice,
[1252.44 → 1253.32] once made,
[1253.68 → 1256.34] which renders believers perfect forever.
[1257.36 → 1261.24] This is also why the angel of God called Him Jesus,
[1261.76 → 1263.00] that it is sacred,
[1263.52 → 1266.68] because He will save His people from their sins.
[1267.32 → 1267.66] is
[1267.66 → 1282.28] His people from His love?
[1282.28 → 1282.70] Yes.

[1319.82 → 1328.82] Thou changeest all the compassions they belong.
[1329.42 → 1336.34] As the words be and forever will be.
[1337.72 → 1344.82] Great is my faithfulness, free is my faithfulness.
[1344.82 → 1352.82] For in my glory new mercies I see.

[1402.82 → 1410.82] Great is my faithfulness, the ways I give the rest.
[1411.82 → 1417.82] Morning by morning new mercies I see.

[1426.82 → 1432.82] Great is my faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
[1432.82 → 1444.82] Morning, Lord, sing in the peace that endures.
[1444.82 → 1452.82] My own dear presence to cheer and to die.

[1473.82 → 1476.82] Great is my faithfulness.
[1476.82 → 1480.82] Lord, I am free, I am the full of my hills.

[1769.82 → 1771.82] Amen.
[1771.82 → 1773.82] Good morning.
[1773.82 → 1774.82] My name's Yap.
[1774.82 → 1776.82] I'm a deacon here at Langley Emanuel.
[1776.82 → 1781.82] This morning's collection will be for Cascade Christian Counselling.
[1781.82 → 1791.04] Cascade Christian Counselling is a local non-profit organization providing a caring, faith-based approach to helping people move towards healing.
[1791.72 → 1793.72] Please give as you're able to. Thank you.
[1811.82 → 1841.80] Thank you.
[1841.82 → 1871.80] Thank you.

[1933.82 → 1935.82] Thank you.
[1935.82 → 1937.82] Thank you.
[1937.82 → 1939.82] Thank you.

[1959.82 → 1961.82] Thank you.
[1961.82 → 1963.82] Thank you.

[1965.82 → 1967.82] Thank you.
[1967.82 → 1969.82] Thank you.
[1969.82 → 1971.82] Thank you.
[1971.82 → 1973.82] Thank you.
[1973.82 → 1975.82] Thank you.
[1975.82 → 1977.82] Thank you.
[1977.82 → 1979.82] Thank you.
[1979.82 → 1981.82] Thank you.
[1981.82 → 1983.82] Thank you.
[1983.82 → 1985.82] Thank you.
[1985.82 → 1987.82] Thank you.
[1987.84 → 1989.82] Thank you.
[1989.82 → 1998.54] Give your eyes to joyful service, and sing His praises, love, and air.
[2000.16 → 2010.64] Give your eyes to joyful service, and sing His praises, love, and air.
[2019.82 → 2026.66] Good morning. I'd like to invite any of the kids up.
[2026.66 → 2034.96] If you're age 3, up until grade 4, you can come join us at the front for a moment before we head off to our worship and children's worship time.
[2042.44 → 2047.16] I'm wondering if any of you kids have ever done a puzzle before.
[2047.16 → 2050.94] Lots of you have done a puzzle before. Excellent.
[2051.40 → 2054.66] Do you think that if I asked... Amazing.
[2055.22 → 2058.82] Do you think if I asked the whole church that some of them might have done a puzzle before, too?
[2059.44 → 2063.14] I'm going to ask them. Has anyone else here ever done a puzzle?
[2063.26 → 2065.28] We could just raise your hand if you've ever done a puzzle.
[2066.34 → 2068.48] Okay, lots of them have done a puzzle, too.
[2069.52 → 2073.72] Have you ever done a puzzle that took you, like, maybe more than a whole day,
[2073.72 → 2077.24] because there were so many pieces, and they were a little bit tricky to put together?
[2077.56 → 2077.82] Yeah?
[2078.48 → 2080.14] I've done some of those before, too.
[2080.58 → 2083.20] And sometimes, I kind of wanted to give up.
[2083.60 → 2086.84] We had a puzzle once, and it was a bunch of dogs and these doors,
[2086.96 → 2089.02] and the doors, you know what? They all look the same.
[2089.54 → 2092.56] And the black looked the same, and after a few days, we thought,
[2092.64 → 2094.52] are we ever going to finish this puzzle?
[2094.52 → 2094.96] Yeah.
[2099.78 → 2100.10] Yeah.
[2101.62 → 2105.12] It might have taken two days, because sometimes puzzles can be really hard.
[2105.84 → 2106.16] Wow.
[2108.66 → 2111.34] In the end, I was really glad when I finished the puzzle,
[2111.44 → 2112.86] even though it was really hard work,
[2112.94 → 2115.14] and maybe you could remember a puzzle that you've done,
[2115.32 → 2118.02] that in the end, when you saw the whole picture, you thought,
[2118.34 → 2119.62] wow, this is really cool.
[2119.62 → 2122.90] I'm glad that I actually finished the whole puzzle and got to see it
[2122.90 → 2126.20] before you probably took it apart and put it back in the box.
[2126.84 → 2127.98] So you could do it again another day.
[2128.64 → 2132.60] So today in children's worship, we're going to talk about being peacemakers
[2132.60 → 2135.50] and how that can be a really hard job sometimes,
[2136.26 → 2139.64] but that it's worth it in the end, because that's how Jesus calls us to live.
[2140.32 → 2143.08] So before we go off to learn more about that,
[2143.12 → 2146.84] we're going to stand up, and we're going to offer our blessing to the church,
[2146.84 → 2148.60] and they're going to give one back in return.
[2149.62 → 2150.62] Amen.
[2153.62 → 2156.32] The Lord be with you.
[2156.64 → 2158.16] And also with you.
[2179.62 → 2185.18] Good morning.
[2185.78 → 2186.96] I'm Steve and Elder here.
[2188.66 → 2190.76] Before I pray, I have a couple announcements.
[2191.10 → 2193.72] One, if you haven't noticed, your tax receipts are in the mailbox,
[2194.26 → 2195.96] so you can find them there after the service.
[2195.96 → 2199.94] And then next week we'll be celebrating the Lord's Supper,
[2200.12 → 2202.58] so we can look forward to that.
[2202.58 → 2209.10] And also a few prayers and announcements, health concerns that are not in the Bolton,
[2209.16 → 2209.94] I'll be praying for.
[2210.56 → 2213.36] One is Greta Kisser.
[2214.70 → 2219.34] Her sister Evelyn sounds like it's very critical now.
[2219.34 → 2226.44] She's got a serious lung infection, heart infection, is on a ventilator in ICU, Royal Caribbean.
[2227.14 → 2230.94] She suffered a stroke last night, so the next little while it is very critical.
[2231.76 → 2232.68] So pray for her.
[2232.68 → 2235.30] And also for Kobe Deborah.
[2236.08 → 2240.70] She's a daughter-in-law of Robin Mary and Form remembers here.
[2240.92 → 2244.44] She's battling leukemia right now and receiving treatment.
[2244.56 → 2248.52] She's a young mom, so it's a very difficult situation there as well.
[2248.52 → 2251.04] So we'll pray for her and the family.
[2253.22 → 2254.14] Let us pray.
[2257.36 → 2260.30] Gracious God, Father, our Lord Jesus Christ,
[2260.72 → 2263.10] we come to you with hearts full of praise,
[2263.42 → 2265.98] grateful for the grace and mercy we have received from you,
[2266.60 → 2269.14] thankful for the relationship we have with you,
[2269.62 → 2273.58] knowing that you are there beside us in both our joys and our sorrows.
[2273.58 → 2278.84] As we see the first signs of spring, we look forward to warmer days ahead.
[2279.08 → 2280.82] We praise you for the wonders of creation,
[2281.34 → 2283.88] for the beauty in nature, for the gift of each day.
[2284.42 → 2287.30] We pray that we may be good stewards of the earth and the resources
[2287.30 → 2289.14] and good neighbours to all.
[2289.72 → 2293.68] May your love be continually shown through our actions and our words.
[2294.30 → 2296.48] We pray for the people of all nations.
[2296.94 → 2300.18] We pray for the end of poverty, hunger, disease, injustice,
[2300.54 → 2302.56] for violence and wars to cease.
[2303.58 → 2305.78] May those who are in governance and positions of power
[2305.78 → 2307.84] work towards true justice and peace.
[2308.50 → 2311.20] We thank you for this church and for our congregation
[2311.20 → 2314.42] and those in leadership, our staff, our council, committees,
[2314.54 → 2315.58] and our numerous volunteers.
[2317.04 → 2319.64] We are thankful for the Mexico mission team
[2319.64 → 2321.22] and that they could hold a dinner yesterday.
[2321.76 → 2323.98] We pray for them as they make their final preparations
[2323.98 → 2325.14] for the trip this spring.
[2326.56 → 2329.48] Guide us by your Holy Spirit in all that we do,
[2329.48 → 2333.34] that we may work to do your will in all that we may do.
[2335.78 → 2337.64] We give you thanks in our troubles.
[2338.24 → 2342.02] We may turn to you, that in your strong arms
[2342.02 → 2345.88] when we offload our sins, our weariness, our pain, and our grief.
[2346.28 → 2349.42] We pray for those who are struggling with heavy burden today,
[2349.92 → 2353.32] including those that are grieving, lonely, anxious,
[2353.32 → 2356.68] dealing with addiction, struggling with their mental health,
[2356.80 → 2357.58] their physical health,
[2358.28 → 2361.00] for those awaiting test results or surgeries,
[2361.18 → 2362.86] undergoing treatments in pain,
[2363.42 → 2366.22] or dealing with long-term health issues.
[2366.88 → 2373.02] This week we specifically pray for Greta Kisser's sister, Evelyn,
[2373.22 → 2375.96] who's obviously in very critical condition right now.
[2376.08 → 2377.68] We pray for her.
[2378.10 → 2378.94] We pray for healing.
[2378.94 → 2383.60] We pray for Greta and give her all the strength she needs in this time
[2383.60 → 2384.82] of all she's endured.
[2385.70 → 2390.72] We pray for Kobe DeBoersep's health,
[2390.88 → 2392.80] and we pray that you can bring her healing
[2392.80 → 2396.98] and that she can win the battle against leukemia.
[2397.54 → 2400.98] We pray for the strength for the family of supporting her from afar.
[2401.16 → 2405.28] She's not at home, and we pray for all those that support her.
[2405.28 → 2411.30] We pray for Ellen White, who is recovering from a successful hip surgery,
[2411.44 → 2415.48] and we pray that the rehab goes well and that she can return home.
[2416.34 → 2417.08] We pray for healing.
[2418.10 → 2421.44] We pray to be with Pastor Chris as he leads us this morning.
[2421.78 → 2426.48] We thank you for his willingness to share his gifts, talents, and insights here at Emmanuel.
[2426.68 → 2429.42] We ask you to bless him and his message this morning.
[2429.60 → 2433.92] We pray this all in the name of Jesus Christ, your Son, and our Lord and Saviour.
[2433.92 → 2434.54] Amen.
[2435.28 → 2461.64] When I was a kid, growing up, we would go camping every summer to Killer Provincial Park
[2461.64 → 2465.42] in sort of central northern Ontario.
[2467.36 → 2471.72] And as I got older, my family started staying there longer and longer.
[2471.86 → 2475.08] We would go for three weeks, which was the maximum amount of time
[2475.08 → 2478.26] you were allowed to stay in a provincial park in Ontario at the time.
[2478.78 → 2482.38] But then my parents got wise to it that you could book back-to-back,
[2482.52 → 2485.76] and so then we would go for six weeks, and you would just change halfway through.
[2485.76 → 2491.48] And then my mom figured out when we got a little bit older as teenagers living at home
[2491.48 → 2497.52] that she could do eight weeks of camping in the summer, and we could just stay back at our house
[2497.52 → 2500.72] and drive to and from work ourselves or get rides.
[2500.78 → 2502.30] And so she had a beautiful summer.
[2502.30 → 2511.08] Eventually, what started happening is as the park started allowing longer and longer camping seasons,
[2511.08 → 2519.34] we started camping for Thanksgiving weekend in October with our extended De Winter family.
[2519.34 → 2525.78] And so 45, 50 people would go camping for that weekend.
[2526.56 → 2533.08] And now Thanksgiving weekend in October in Ontario can sometimes get freezing.
[2534.02 → 2537.60] And when it's freezing out, you do creative things to stay warm.
[2537.96 → 2539.60] And so we would get propane heaters.
[2539.68 → 2544.34] I have one cousin who is a mason, and so he would bring one of those big salamander propane heaters.
[2544.34 → 2549.40] We would set up tents and then put tarps all around it and create this whole balloon of hot air.
[2551.88 → 2557.82] And we would gather together in these spaces, very enclosed.
[2559.46 → 2562.14] And another thing that we would do to stay warm, I should say we,
[2562.46 → 2566.26] another thing that those who were of legal age to do would stay warm
[2566.26 → 2568.48] would be to have a couple adult beverages.
[2568.48 → 2578.18] Now, when you mix confined spaces, adult beverages, and four or five extended days together,
[2578.94 → 2583.44] certain conversations that you don't normally have come to the table.
[2584.90 → 2586.54] Yeah, some of you are wondering, oh boy.
[2588.94 → 2597.76] And so that family camping weekend developed a reputation for people going home upset with each other
[2597.76 → 2600.86] and us needing to reconcile in the weeks after Thanksgiving.
[2603.86 → 2607.20] Eventually, the family passed a rule,
[2607.72 → 2611.76] and it's not an unspoken family rule like you all know, like this rule was spoken.
[2613.34 → 2617.96] No talking about politics or religion.
[2619.86 → 2621.96] Because things got divided.
[2622.10 → 2626.78] As you can imagine, we had a very diverse family of opinions and perspectives.
[2626.78 → 2628.86] Some of them are stubborn Dutchmen.
[2629.24 → 2631.64] Others of them are stubborn Scotsmen.
[2632.00 → 2636.06] And so it was a great time to sit back and watch.
[2637.40 → 2643.22] Now, I also confess, as I got older and went away to university and started learning things,
[2643.30 → 2645.50] I tried to contribute to these conversations.
[2646.24 → 2652.58] Turns out, my expertise and authority in university education meant nothing to anyone in the room,
[2652.58 → 2654.72] and I didn't hear anything I had to say.
[2656.24 → 2657.84] And so the rule persisted.
[2658.24 → 2661.18] No discussion of religion and politics.
[2661.32 → 2663.14] Why do I make this point to you today?
[2663.72 → 2667.12] Because today we're going to discuss religion and politics.
[2668.26 → 2670.04] And here's what I'm confident of.
[2670.40 → 2673.36] I will offend some of you this morning.
[2673.36 → 2681.18] My hope is to equally distribute my offence around the room.
[2683.10 → 2686.30] Further, I hope it's actually not me that's offending you,
[2686.84 → 2689.54] but it's the Word of God that's offending your sensibilities
[2689.54 → 2693.76] and challenging your presumptions about how these things work and work together.
[2693.76 → 2699.52] And so I pray for grace, your grace, and God's grace in this time.
[2699.94 → 2703.50] And I pray for continued conversation.
[2704.76 → 2709.84] So follow this up in your circles and in your dining tables, in your care groups and the like.
[2710.00 → 2711.32] Dive into these things.
[2711.48 → 2716.64] Let's not be afraid of hard, disagreeable conversations.
[2717.06 → 2721.94] But may I just say, when you have conversations in which you disagree,
[2721.94 → 2723.46] don't be disagreeable.
[2724.48 → 2725.30] Did you get the distinction?
[2726.64 → 2726.78] Right?
[2726.88 → 2730.12] Enter into these things well and together and let's see what happens.
[2730.86 → 2734.32] So this morning and next week, actually,
[2734.44 → 2736.28] because we're going to do this for two weeks in a row,
[2736.72 → 2743.06] we're going to read together Romans 13, verse 1 through 7, actually.
[2744.92 → 2748.30] And so if you have a Bible, I invite you to open it up.
[2748.44 → 2750.66] The first time we go through, it will be on the screen.
[2750.84 → 2752.28] There are Bibles at the back.
[2752.28 → 2755.92] If you don't have one or if you don't have a device with the Bible on it, you can grab one there.
[2757.36 → 2761.60] And then encourage you as we read to keep that open in front of you.
[2761.60 → 2768.72] Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities,
[2768.72 → 2773.64] for there is no authority except that which God has established.
[2774.32 → 2777.92] The authorities that exist have been established by God.
[2777.92 → 2785.40] Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted,
[2785.72 → 2788.88] and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.
[2788.88 → 2795.58] For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong.
[2796.58 → 2799.96] Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority?
[2800.24 → 2802.64] Then do what is right, and you will be commended.
[2803.58 → 2806.50] For the one in authority is God's servant for your good.
[2806.50 → 2809.64] But if you do wrong, be afraid.
[2809.64 → 2813.04] For rulers do not bear the sword for no reason.
[2814.20 → 2819.14] They are God's servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.
[2820.44 → 2826.24] Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities not only because of possible punishment,
[2826.24 → 2829.28] but also as a matter of conscience.
[2830.72 → 2833.30] This is also why you pay taxes,
[2834.02 → 2838.82] for the authorities are God's servants who give their full time to governing.
[2839.74 → 2841.92] Give to everyone what you owe them.
[2842.32 → 2844.10] If you owe taxes, pay taxes.
[2844.38 → 2845.76] If revenue, then revenue.
[2845.98 → 2847.56] If respected, then respect.
[2847.86 → 2850.08] If honored, then honour.
[2851.68 → 2852.92] This is the word of the Lord.
[2856.24 → 2864.14] Now, I have already indicated that next week we will be coming back to this text,
[2864.70 → 2871.34] and that's because I believe in order to do justice to the scope of this content,
[2871.90 → 2875.76] we are given two things to focus on.
[2876.44 → 2880.96] And so I'm dividing this text and its principles and themes and applications
[2880.96 → 2888.26] into two sides of the same sort of authority structure coin.
[2888.26 → 2890.58] On the one hand, and our focus for today,
[2890.96 → 2896.50] is what it means to be responsible citizens in the world today,
[2896.60 → 2898.58] in society that we live.
[2898.86 → 2902.56] And then on the other side of that coin, where we will look next week,
[2902.76 → 2907.70] is what does it mean to be responsible or to have responsible governments.
[2907.70 → 2910.34] And so today we look at citizenship.
[2911.24 → 2917.12] Next week we'll look at governance or governments and the structures therein.
[2919.18 → 2925.42] As we dig into today, you will also note that there's a shared foundation
[2925.42 → 2930.18] for responsible citizens and responsible governing.
[2930.66 → 2936.06] Now, the big idea, the theme that we're going to operate has sort of four points to it,
[2936.06 → 2940.98] and that is that responsible citizens understand order.
[2942.36 → 2944.54] Responsible citizens do what is good.
[2945.48 → 2948.52] Responsible citizens do good for goodness’s sake.
[2948.74 → 2950.00] I'll explain that when we get there.
[2950.40 → 2954.42] And responsible citizens give equitably as it is due.
[2954.78 → 2956.82] And again, I'll explain that when we get there.
[2957.72 → 2959.96] Start in that first banner.
[2960.28 → 2963.14] Responsible citizens understand order.
[2963.14 → 2968.80] Or, to put it this way, responsible citizens understand that there is an order
[2968.80 → 2972.08] to the structuring of these things.
[2973.22 → 2974.80] Verse 1 begins,
[2975.72 → 2978.60] Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities,
[2979.02 → 2983.74] for there is no authority except that which God has established.
[2984.44 → 2989.06] The authorities that exist have been established by God.
[2989.06 → 2996.52] And so the first principle of application to see is that a responsible citizen is someone
[2996.52 → 3000.62] who first understands that the authority and the government structures
[3000.62 → 3005.30] are established by God's providential hand.
[3005.98 → 3010.82] That is, he works to create and uphold and to build them
[3010.82 → 3014.54] and has particular purposes for them.
[3014.54 → 3022.44] Now, as Christians, I'm aware that sometimes we talk about God's sovereignty
[3022.44 → 3025.60] in the sort of super macro level.
[3026.14 → 3029.48] Right here, we think about the big movements of history,
[3029.96 → 3034.68] the ebbs and flows of eras and epochs moving in and out,
[3034.80 → 3036.82] and empires rising and falling.
[3036.82 → 3044.30] And at other times, we talk about God's sovereignty manifest in his providential work
[3044.30 → 3046.64] in the small things, the micro things.
[3047.16 → 3048.56] How does Jesus put it?
[3048.82 → 3053.72] The not a hair can fall from my head without the will of my Father in heaven kind of way.
[3054.94 → 3058.52] And so we are familiar with the macro, and we are familiar with the micro,
[3058.52 → 3063.02] but sometimes it's easy for us to overlook the in-between.
[3064.72 → 3068.10] And included in that in-between, in that middle,
[3069.00 → 3072.12] might be something like, for instance,
[3072.52 → 3077.90] God using ordinary means of medicine to bring healing.
[3078.96 → 3079.46] Right?
[3079.52 → 3080.90] The healing still happens,
[3081.28 → 3084.38] and it's the result of God's work in your body,
[3084.38 → 3088.50] but it's through the means of doctors and hospitals,
[3088.82 → 3090.24] not through the means of miracles.
[3091.96 → 3095.84] I want to suggest that sometimes included in that middle
[3095.84 → 3099.38] is also something like governmental authority.
[3100.22 → 3100.96] Right?
[3101.00 → 3107.16] That's established by God for his purposes in providing order to society.
[3108.12 → 3113.66] The governing authorities are part of the creation order,
[3113.66 → 3119.48] and they're part of that ongoing providential order of God.
[3119.80 → 3119.96] Right?
[3120.06 → 3123.20] God is establishing these authorities.
[3123.46 → 3126.82] Now, before we dig deep into governance here,
[3126.98 → 3132.02] let's note that the word used there, authorities, is plural.
[3133.28 → 3133.42] Right?
[3133.46 → 3135.58] And so the first thing to see is that there are authorities.
[3136.86 → 3137.08] Right?
[3137.08 → 3141.80] God has established multiple authorities as part of the creation order,
[3141.80 → 3148.16] and these spheres are established by God.
[3148.26 → 3152.74] These spheres of authority are established by God,
[3152.82 → 3156.24] and governing authorities are one sphere,
[3156.88 → 3160.70] and I will suggest to you that they are a sphere that plays a special role
[3160.70 → 3162.60] in relation to the other spheres,
[3162.98 → 3164.78] the other established authorities.
[3164.78 → 3167.86] Now, to make that point,
[3167.96 → 3172.64] some of those other established authorities,
[3172.64 → 3175.68] some of those other authority spheres,
[3176.60 → 3178.50] are things like the family.
[3179.20 → 3179.40] Right?
[3179.42 → 3184.42] We believe that the family is one of the actually root authorities
[3184.42 → 3185.84] in the created order.
[3185.84 → 3186.44] Right?
[3186.50 → 3191.50] That parents have a responsibility to raise their kids in the fear of the Lord
[3191.50 → 3195.68] and have a responsibility to raise their kids as responsible citizens
[3195.68 → 3197.26] of the kingdom of heaven.
[3198.56 → 3198.66] Right?
[3199.02 → 3206.40] Your primary job as a parent isn't only to keep your child alive,
[3206.54 → 3209.56] but it's to raise healthy, functioning adults.
[3211.02 → 3211.22] Right?
[3211.24 → 3215.80] And sometimes when you're in the midst of the trials of raising young,
[3217.28 → 3218.68] strong-willed children,
[3218.68 → 3219.60] I have to be careful,
[3219.70 → 3221.32] and I'm going to keep looking over at this side of the room,
[3221.36 → 3222.28] not at that side of the room,
[3222.84 → 3225.60] we can forget that the goal,
[3226.24 → 3226.54] right,
[3226.58 → 3230.46] is to raise healthy, functioning adults.
[3231.96 → 3236.12] Another area or authority that exists,
[3236.22 → 3236.86] right, of course,
[3236.94 → 3239.52] would be the church or religious institutions,
[3239.52 → 3243.56] which have their own realm of interest in the areas of faith
[3243.56 → 3247.56] and proclamation for us as Christians,
[3247.86 → 3248.90] for the gospel,
[3249.08 → 3251.50] but for other religious institutions as well.
[3253.90 → 3256.02] I'll throw this out there for you to think about,
[3256.12 → 3260.26] but it was third-century Christians
[3260.26 → 3267.94] who argued for religious freedoms in the Roman Empire for everyone,
[3268.54 → 3269.94] not just for Christians.
[3269.94 → 3275.96] This idea of religious freedom is part of the Christian tradition and influence,
[3276.96 → 3277.10] right,
[3277.14 → 3280.60] because we believe these things have their own spheres of authority.
[3282.46 → 3284.80] Another place, right,
[3284.86 → 3291.24] because it's not just in this sort of recognizable institutions like family or church,
[3291.24 → 3296.12] but it's also in things like the arts,
[3296.70 → 3296.92] right,
[3296.98 → 3299.86] the arts have their own sphere of authority.
[3300.42 → 3304.00] Natural sciences have their own sphere of authority.
[3306.12 → 3309.94] And part of what it means to be a responsible citizen,
[3309.94 → 3313.18] as we look at that here from Romans 13,
[3313.18 → 3322.82] is that we recognize that there is a certain order to the structures of authority,
[3322.82 → 3330.20] and we understand that those authorities sort of function unto themselves.
[3330.20 → 3334.82] That is to say that the sphere of family is not the sphere of arts,
[3336.28 → 3336.46] right,
[3336.50 → 3340.64] or the sphere of church is not the sphere of government.
[3340.64 → 3344.10] These authorities are different
[3344.10 → 3347.70] and have different areas to provide for.
[3349.14 → 3351.22] And what gets into this then,
[3351.28 → 3353.12] or what comes out of this idea,
[3353.30 → 3355.78] is that this established order,
[3356.44 → 3356.64] right,
[3356.70 → 3360.12] created by God and providentially continued by Him,
[3360.12 → 3361.72] this established order,
[3362.10 → 3370.48] then necessarily and certainly comes with limits on the scope of these earthly authorities.
[3370.64 → 3371.60] That is,
[3371.60 → 3373.28] they're sort of a bounded set.
[3376.16 → 3377.52] And I want to suggest to you
[3377.52 → 3381.70] that it's the governing authorities' responsibility,
[3382.16 → 3384.04] it's the state's responsibility
[3384.04 → 3389.88] to ensure that these limits around the other authorities,
[3390.42 → 3391.56] these earthly authorities,
[3391.56 → 3393.94] are maintained and protected.
[3393.94 → 3401.52] Okay, part of the function of the state is to ensure that these other established spheres
[3401.52 → 3405.62] can function well and without tyranny from the other spheres.
[3405.62 → 3407.46] Now,
[3407.46 → 3419.66] I've been around Canadian and American political systems long enough to recognize,
[3420.28 → 3421.72] and I'm a reformed pastor,
[3421.94 → 3424.94] so I believe in the depravity of human nature,
[3425.34 → 3425.48] right,
[3425.50 → 3428.52] to recognize that there's a danger inherent here
[3428.52 → 3433.60] because people can and will abuse any authority given to them.
[3434.48 → 3435.66] And because in many ways,
[3436.22 → 3441.90] the state sphere is sort of elevated over the top of the other spheres
[3441.90 → 3445.44] in order to ensure that there is equity within them,
[3445.80 → 3447.02] that there is a tendency,
[3447.58 → 3450.18] and we see this work out over and over and over in history,
[3450.48 → 3454.00] for the state to over-function in its responsibilities.
[3454.00 → 3457.82] And instead of ensuring that the local areas,
[3457.96 → 3463.44] that the smallest common denominator can deal with the properly functioning orders,
[3463.94 → 3471.92] what happens is that citizens upload responsibilities to a higher body
[3471.92 → 3473.88] that, of course, willingly takes it
[3473.88 → 3478.62] because we're all going to try to get more influence or more power.
[3480.08 → 3482.52] And sometimes we see this, right,
[3482.52 → 3486.66] that higher body seizes authority from those other places.
[3487.88 → 3492.62] Now, the reality is that even people who are elected to office
[3492.62 → 3497.58] or even people who are there by the divine right of kings and named monarch
[3497.58 → 3500.66] or even people who seize authority as dictators,
[3501.46 → 3506.24] the reality, of course, is that we are all depraved and struggle with sin.
[3506.24 → 3515.82] And so, responsible citizens will put limits on the scope of the power we give them.
[3516.30 → 3522.82] We'll put checks and balances into the systems and structures of our ordinances.
[3522.82 → 3527.86] So, in summary of this first point,
[3527.96 → 3531.34] responsible citizens understand order,
[3531.66 → 3535.36] understand that there is a created order to the governing authorities
[3535.36 → 3541.54] and to the authorities and spheres of life that God has built into creation
[3541.54 → 3546.08] and that he continues to provide through his providential care.
[3546.08 → 3551.60] And as well, because we are clear on who we are and our needs,
[3551.76 → 3556.38] responsible citizens understand the need for checks and balances and limits
[3556.38 → 3558.74] because, like I said, we understand anthropology.
[3559.92 → 3561.22] We know what it means to be human.
[3561.22 → 3570.66] But out of that, it is important for you to hear and to remember,
[3570.96 → 3576.92] always remember that God has established the authorities that exist.
[3578.62 → 3581.14] The sin has corrupted them and people have abused them,
[3581.70 → 3585.56] but God has established them and continues to use them.
[3586.24 → 3590.04] Which then takes us to our second idea, which comes from verse 2.
[3591.22 → 3592.36] Verse 2 says,
[3593.10 → 3598.48] Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted,
[3598.70 → 3602.36] and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.
[3603.78 → 3607.80] It is pretty clear that because God has established these authorities,
[3608.12 → 3611.34] rebelling against them is rebelling against what God has instituted.
[3612.02 → 3615.76] That's what it means when Paul uses the word consequently to introduce that line.
[3617.52 → 3620.44] Now, interesting to me anyway, interesting to me, I hope it's to you,
[3620.44 → 3623.46] the word that is translated rebel,
[3625.12 → 3629.72] is where we get the English word antithesis from.
[3631.36 → 3633.62] And so, I think part of what it means to rebel,
[3633.68 → 3634.78] and what is being talked about here,
[3634.90 → 3638.86] is to act in and at cross-purposes,
[3639.12 → 3640.44] in antithesis to,
[3640.80 → 3642.10] the governing authority.
[3642.10 → 3646.92] Now, for many of us,
[3646.96 → 3650.22] I get that that seems like a pretty strong statement,
[3650.22 → 3656.38] and we might start to bristle under what seems to be the absolute nature of that.
[3657.44 → 3658.88] And I want to be candid with you,
[3659.24 → 3662.94] because we aren't really helped by looking at other places in the Bible
[3662.94 → 3665.06] for an easy way out of this.
[3665.06 → 3669.14] In 1 Peter 2, we read,
[3669.14 → 3692.88] Paul continues this,
[3692.88 → 3694.90] pressing it down on us,
[3694.96 → 3697.54] writing a very similar thing in his letter to Titus.
[3697.74 → 3698.54] He says,
[3699.24 → 3700.34] in Titus 3,
[3701.22 → 3704.12] remind the people to be subject to the rulers
[3704.12 → 3705.78] and authorities,
[3706.22 → 3707.04] to be obedient,
[3707.38 → 3709.30] and to be ready to do whatever is good,
[3709.68 → 3711.04] to slander no one,
[3711.32 → 3713.22] to be peaceable and considerate,
[3713.32 → 3715.82] and always gentle toward everyone.
[3715.82 → 3719.78] I got to tell you,
[3720.02 → 3722.56] when I was preparing this week,
[3723.42 → 3725.02] that little phrase,
[3726.10 → 3727.52] to slander no one,
[3728.50 → 3730.32] hit me right between the eyes.
[3732.18 → 3736.84] Especially as we talk about our governing authorities and political leaders.
[3738.72 → 3740.70] Now, again, let me be abundantly clear, right?
[3740.74 → 3745.06] I have no love lost for our current political establishment
[3745.06 → 3748.82] in Canada and many of the ideologies that undergird it.
[3749.16 → 3751.46] But, and here's where I'm going to offend at least one of you,
[3751.90 → 3753.52] that doesn't give me the right
[3753.52 → 3756.44] to talk about the prime minister the way that I have.
[3759.92 → 3762.04] Some of you are familiar with the kind of bumper stickers
[3762.04 → 3763.94] that have become popular in the last few years.
[3765.30 → 3767.18] The snicker means you know what I'm talking about.
[3767.88 → 3771.36] Or the giant flags that people fly on their trucks.
[3771.36 → 3776.38] How does that hold up against 1 Peter 2,
[3776.50 → 3777.28] against Titus 3,
[3777.54 → 3778.62] and against Romans 13?
[3783.20 → 3785.64] I suspect some of us are being hit right between the eyes.
[3785.96 → 3786.60] And if you're not,
[3787.60 → 3789.60] you're probably not listening.
[3791.48 → 3793.14] Because all of us
[3793.14 → 3795.56] are guilty of this.
[3795.56 → 3797.64] That's not an overstatement.
[3800.28 → 3801.86] And also, hear this, right?
[3802.02 → 3803.98] It's important to hold this against the context
[3803.98 → 3806.20] of what Peter and Paul are writing to.
[3807.12 → 3809.36] When Peter and Paul are writing these statements,
[3809.78 → 3814.16] they are talking about a very non-Christian government.
[3815.10 → 3816.38] In the Roman Empire,
[3816.82 → 3819.06] the authorities that are in view here,
[3819.16 → 3820.96] that are told to be held up,
[3821.12 → 3822.32] propped up and prayed for,
[3822.42 → 3825.10] that we are told to pursue the good of,
[3825.10 → 3825.62] right?
[3825.68 → 3826.90] They are unfriendly,
[3826.98 → 3828.34] they are actively hostile,
[3828.82 → 3829.80] and in some cases,
[3829.92 → 3830.50] and eventually,
[3830.92 → 3834.22] they're actively persecuting and killing Christians.
[3835.54 → 3836.52] In fact, in Peter,
[3836.60 → 3838.16] we looked at this a few years ago,
[3838.32 → 3840.80] Peter is writing to a group of Christians
[3840.80 → 3842.76] who in just a few years' time,
[3842.82 → 3844.68] in a generation or two after his letter,
[3845.04 → 3847.88] will experience direct and immediate persecution
[3847.88 → 3849.72] from the governor in that region,
[3849.80 → 3850.56] a man named Pliny,
[3850.94 → 3853.54] on behalf of the emperor Trajan back in Rome.
[3853.54 → 3857.36] because they wouldn't worship the emperor.
[3858.74 → 3861.76] And Pliny uses that as a test to find them out and to kill them.
[3864.64 → 3866.56] And into that context,
[3866.56 → 3872.36] we are told to honour the emperor.
[3875.02 → 3876.92] Now, I don't think it's wrong to say
[3876.92 → 3880.26] that the injustices committed against those Christians
[3880.26 → 3882.20] in the New Testament and shortly thereafter
[3882.20 → 3885.10] far outweighs any injustice
[3885.10 → 3886.64] you might be experiencing
[3886.64 → 3888.84] from the governing authorities today.
[3888.84 → 3893.46] Maybe that will change.
[3893.52 → 3894.26] I pray it doesn't.
[3895.66 → 3897.10] But let's be humble enough
[3897.10 → 3900.16] to recognize what's actually going on
[3900.16 → 3903.38] and what's not actually going on.
[3903.38 → 3908.08] No.
[3909.76 → 3911.08] Don't hear what I'm not saying.
[3912.14 → 3912.46] Right?
[3912.50 → 3916.16] That doesn't mean you should passively accept those injustices
[3916.16 → 3917.04] or that doesn't mean
[3917.04 → 3920.28] you should passively accept disagreement
[3920.28 → 3921.32] and ignore them.
[3921.32 → 3923.88] But it does mean
[3923.88 → 3926.52] that your first posture
[3926.52 → 3930.52] should be prayerful submission.
[3932.18 → 3932.28] Right?
[3932.34 → 3934.56] Our first posture should be
[3934.56 → 3936.40] humbly lifting
[3936.40 → 3938.64] the governing authorities in prayer
[3938.64 → 3940.80] because they are established by God.
[3941.18 → 3941.30] Right?
[3941.32 → 3943.22] Your first posture should be a reflection
[3943.22 → 3944.96] of 1 Peter 2.13
[3944.96 → 3945.56] which says
[3945.56 → 3946.64] submit yourselves
[3946.64 → 3948.50] for the Lord's sake
[3948.50 → 3951.44] to every human authority.
[3954.26 → 3954.46] Right?
[3954.52 → 3955.84] What's clear here
[3955.84 → 3957.94] is that the default position
[3957.94 → 3958.92] of the Christian
[3958.92 → 3960.22] to the state
[3960.22 → 3962.82] is to submit.
[3965.04 → 3966.28] I'm going to let that sit
[3966.28 → 3967.94] with you for a minute.
[3967.94 → 3976.82] That's the default position.
[3980.76 → 3981.24] Now,
[3981.56 → 3983.16] I'm anticipating your questions.
[3983.34 → 3984.68] I'm anticipating your pushback.
[3985.30 → 3985.56] Right?
[3985.60 → 3986.42] I know there's a question
[3986.42 → 3987.58] hanging over your heads.
[3987.58 → 3988.88] What if
[3988.88 → 3990.44] the governing authority
[3990.44 → 3993.20] acts at cross purposes
[3993.20 → 3994.02] right?
[3994.26 → 3995.24] Rebels against
[3995.24 → 3996.20] antithesis
[3996.20 → 3998.84] the created order of God?
[4000.80 → 4001.02] Right?
[4001.08 → 4001.52] What is
[4001.52 → 4002.04] what
[4002.04 → 4003.50] what if
[4003.50 → 4004.92] a governing authority
[4004.92 → 4006.34] rejects God?
[4006.46 → 4007.40] Do I have to submit
[4007.40 → 4007.94] to them
[4007.94 → 4008.64] then?
[4010.84 → 4011.04] Now,
[4011.06 → 4012.54] these are really important questions.
[4013.08 → 4014.30] And this is part of what it means
[4014.30 → 4015.40] to be a responsible
[4015.40 → 4016.48] citizen.
[4018.30 → 4019.30] And the text
[4019.30 → 4020.30] gives us
[4020.30 → 4020.92] hints
[4020.92 → 4022.70] at how we might
[4022.70 → 4023.94] understand that.
[4024.02 → 4024.76] It gives us hints
[4024.76 → 4026.24] at the limits
[4026.24 → 4027.68] of authority
[4027.68 → 4028.38] that we might
[4028.38 → 4029.28] brush up against.
[4029.78 → 4030.34] But remember,
[4030.46 → 4031.46] we've already identified
[4031.46 → 4032.90] that there are limits
[4032.90 → 4033.82] to the sphere
[4033.82 → 4034.98] of authority
[4034.98 → 4035.90] for governments
[4035.90 → 4036.54] and for other
[4036.54 → 4037.92] established authorities
[4037.92 → 4038.50] in the world.
[4039.82 → 4040.14] Now,
[4040.18 → 4040.98] in the first place,
[4041.08 → 4041.92] in verse 7,
[4042.62 → 4043.32] Paul writes
[4043.32 → 4043.70] that we
[4043.70 → 4044.80] ought to give
[4044.80 → 4045.58] to everyone
[4045.58 → 4046.48] what you owe them.
[4047.12 → 4047.66] And then he says,
[4047.76 → 4048.48] if you owe taxes,
[4048.62 → 4049.16] give taxes.
[4049.32 → 4049.76] If revenue,
[4049.88 → 4050.26] then revenue.
[4050.40 → 4050.80] If respected,
[4050.88 → 4051.22] then respect.
[4051.36 → 4051.70] If honored,
[4051.78 → 4052.12] then honour.
[4052.12 → 4053.30] Now,
[4053.34 → 4054.24] most Bible scholars
[4054.24 → 4054.72] agree
[4054.72 → 4056.12] that Paul
[4056.12 → 4057.30] is echoing
[4057.30 → 4057.84] Jesus'
[4058.44 → 4058.84] statement
[4058.84 → 4060.38] in Matthew 22
[4060.38 → 4061.44] where he says
[4061.44 → 4062.18] in verse 21,
[4062.64 → 4063.66] give to Caesar
[4063.66 → 4064.90] what is Caesar's
[4064.90 → 4065.86] and to God
[4065.86 → 4066.76] what is God's.
[4067.92 → 4068.06] Now,
[4068.10 → 4068.98] Jesus is using
[4068.98 → 4069.76] this phrase
[4069.76 → 4070.46] to challenge
[4070.46 → 4071.78] a commonly held
[4071.78 → 4072.30] idea
[4072.30 → 4073.42] about the state
[4073.42 → 4074.30] and about the emperor
[4074.30 → 4075.56] during this time.
[4075.64 → 4076.06] The idea
[4076.06 → 4076.74] that the emperor
[4076.74 → 4077.98] is a deity
[4077.98 → 4079.06] or representative
[4079.06 → 4080.14] of the deity
[4080.14 → 4081.02] or he himself
[4081.02 → 4081.58] is a god
[4081.58 → 4082.92] and so closely
[4082.92 → 4083.52] aligned
[4083.52 → 4084.22] with the god
[4084.22 → 4085.26] of a particular region
[4085.26 → 4087.02] or nation state
[4087.02 → 4088.08] that they have
[4088.08 → 4089.42] divine authority
[4089.42 → 4091.24] and that the state
[4091.24 → 4093.08] has divine authority
[4093.08 → 4094.14] through them.
[4094.66 → 4095.50] Jesus is challenging
[4095.50 → 4095.90] that.
[4096.78 → 4097.46] That's what
[4097.46 → 4098.82] eventually becomes
[4098.82 → 4099.96] why the emperors
[4099.96 → 4100.50] are asking
[4100.50 → 4101.32] for worship.
[4102.14 → 4102.86] And Jesus says,
[4102.98 → 4103.22] yes,
[4103.62 → 4104.44] pay your taxes
[4104.44 → 4105.10] to Caesar
[4105.10 → 4106.86] but do not pay
[4106.86 → 4107.42] worship
[4107.42 → 4108.36] to Caesar.
[4108.36 → 4108.58] Right?
[4109.82 → 4110.48] Give to Caesar
[4110.48 → 4111.58] what is Caesar's
[4111.58 → 4112.18] taxes
[4112.18 → 4114.28] but do not
[4114.28 → 4114.98] give to him
[4114.98 → 4116.24] what is God's
[4116.24 → 4117.36] worship.
[4118.72 → 4119.64] And so already,
[4119.88 → 4120.06] right,
[4120.10 → 4121.12] there's one limit
[4121.12 → 4122.64] to this obedience
[4122.64 → 4123.60] and submission
[4123.60 → 4124.30] relationship,
[4124.42 → 4124.52] right?
[4124.54 → 4125.52] We cannot worship
[4125.52 → 4126.86] or be made to worship
[4126.86 → 4128.60] that which isn't God.
[4130.30 → 4130.84] Now,
[4130.86 → 4131.38] I suggest to you
[4131.38 → 4132.58] that the second limit
[4132.58 → 4133.20] that comes out
[4133.20 → 4133.82] of this text
[4133.82 → 4135.52] from this idea
[4135.52 → 4139.16] and you can read
[4139.16 → 4140.42] it in verse 4,
[4140.78 → 4141.36] the idea that
[4141.36 → 4142.24] the ruler is
[4142.24 → 4143.54] God's servant
[4143.54 → 4144.68] for your good.
[4146.30 → 4146.48] Now,
[4146.50 → 4147.62] as God's servant,
[4148.42 → 4149.82] the civil leader,
[4150.14 → 4151.56] the governing authority
[4151.56 → 4152.74] has responsibility
[4152.74 → 4154.24] to operate
[4154.24 → 4156.14] under God's moral order.
[4157.20 → 4157.30] Right?
[4157.36 → 4158.04] A servant
[4158.04 → 4159.14] is not free
[4159.14 → 4159.64] to do
[4159.64 → 4160.68] whatever he or she
[4160.68 → 4161.28] wishes
[4161.28 → 4162.40] even if they are
[4162.40 → 4162.80] a king
[4162.80 → 4163.64] or a prime minister
[4163.64 → 4164.30] or an emperor.
[4168.52 → 4169.96] In the movie
[4169.96 → 4171.02] The Lion King,
[4171.72 → 4172.48] when Simba
[4172.48 → 4173.30] is really young,
[4174.12 → 4174.82] King Mufasa,
[4174.98 → 4175.40] his dad,
[4175.50 → 4176.32] walks him around
[4176.32 → 4176.88] and they go
[4176.88 → 4178.04] and stand on Pride Rock
[4178.04 → 4178.38] and they say,
[4178.42 → 4179.44] all this will be yours.
[4180.42 → 4181.58] And at one point,
[4181.74 → 4183.00] Simba says to Mufasa,
[4183.14 → 4183.48] he says,
[4183.74 → 4185.00] I thought being king
[4185.00 → 4185.80] means you could do
[4185.80 → 4186.66] whatever you want.
[4187.88 → 4188.88] And his father,
[4189.32 → 4190.02] King Mufasa,
[4190.18 → 4190.52] says,
[4190.70 → 4191.52] there's more
[4191.52 → 4192.58] to being king
[4192.58 → 4193.52] than that.
[4193.64 → 4196.44] The underlying principle
[4196.44 → 4197.28] at work here
[4197.28 → 4198.80] is that if rulers
[4198.80 → 4199.80] are to support
[4199.80 → 4200.72] the doing of right
[4200.72 → 4201.64] and to encourage
[4201.64 → 4202.34] doing right,
[4202.52 → 4203.84] they must not require
[4203.84 → 4204.72] the doing of wrong.
[4205.56 → 4205.72] Right?
[4205.76 → 4206.80] That which is disobedient
[4206.80 → 4207.70] to God's moral order.
[4209.74 → 4210.00] Now,
[4210.64 → 4212.20] wrestle with me here,
[4212.24 → 4212.38] right?
[4212.42 → 4213.70] Because what's implicit
[4213.70 → 4215.62] in these verses
[4215.62 → 4216.86] in Romans 13
[4216.86 → 4218.96] is made more explicit
[4218.96 → 4222.04] and shown by way
[4222.04 → 4222.68] of example
[4222.68 → 4224.06] in the book of Acts.
[4225.26 → 4225.46] Now,
[4225.50 → 4226.16] in Acts 4,
[4226.26 → 4227.02] verse 19,
[4227.64 → 4228.60] Peter and John
[4228.60 → 4229.62] are standing in front
[4229.62 → 4230.58] of the Sanhedrin,
[4231.28 → 4232.80] which is the ruling class
[4232.80 → 4233.88] in Judea.
[4234.28 → 4234.94] They're standing
[4234.94 → 4235.58] in front of them
[4235.58 → 4236.24] because they have been
[4236.24 → 4236.88] called there
[4236.88 → 4238.72] because of the disruptions
[4238.72 → 4239.38] their preaching
[4239.38 → 4240.10] of Jesus
[4240.10 → 4241.42] and his death
[4241.42 → 4242.08] and resurrection
[4242.08 → 4242.82] has caused.
[4242.82 → 4244.92] And Peter says to them,
[4245.34 → 4246.12] which is right
[4246.12 → 4247.08] in God's eyes,
[4247.14 → 4248.00] to listen to you
[4248.00 → 4248.94] or to him?
[4250.92 → 4251.50] And then again,
[4251.60 → 4252.44] in Acts 5,
[4252.82 → 4253.90] Peter is pulled back
[4253.90 → 4255.40] in front of the Sanhedrin
[4255.40 → 4257.08] after the apostles
[4257.08 → 4258.52] were being persecuted
[4258.52 → 4259.06] by them
[4259.06 → 4260.30] for continuing to preach
[4260.30 → 4261.24] even when they said,
[4261.58 → 4262.38] you cannot do that.
[4262.56 → 4263.36] And Peter says,
[4263.44 → 4264.08] very explicitly,
[4264.50 → 4266.00] we must obey God
[4266.00 → 4267.56] rather than human beings.
[4269.40 → 4269.72] And so,
[4269.84 → 4270.76] responsible citizen,
[4270.76 → 4271.78] if the choice
[4271.78 → 4273.02] is between obeying God
[4273.02 → 4274.18] or the governing authorities,
[4274.32 → 4276.36] the choice ought to be obvious.
[4276.68 → 4278.02] We must obey God, right?
[4278.08 → 4279.46] There may be consequences
[4279.46 → 4280.46] to that reality.
[4281.42 → 4281.86] In fact,
[4281.98 → 4283.36] there will be consequences
[4283.36 → 4284.36] to that reality.
[4288.46 → 4290.86] But we must obey God.
[4298.42 → 4299.62] But let me say,
[4299.62 → 4301.20] very carefully,
[4301.64 → 4302.86] and I know that you can
[4302.86 → 4303.56] provide arguments
[4303.56 → 4304.32] one way or the other,
[4305.04 → 4307.98] that most of us
[4307.98 → 4310.94] living in 21st century Canada,
[4311.94 → 4312.36] Langley,
[4312.72 → 4313.66] or the region around,
[4314.52 → 4315.84] have not been faced
[4315.84 → 4316.68] with the choice
[4316.68 → 4317.90] to obey God
[4317.90 → 4319.62] or to obey the governing authorities
[4319.62 → 4321.72] in this same way.
[4321.72 → 4327.36] And so,
[4328.04 → 4331.48] check your humility
[4331.48 → 4333.26] and wonder,
[4333.82 → 4336.50] do I need to
[4336.50 → 4337.76] first submit
[4337.76 → 4338.62] and pray
[4338.62 → 4341.26] before I disobey
[4341.26 → 4342.70] and complain?
[4345.78 → 4347.00] Let me pull this all together
[4347.00 → 4347.72] in a quick little summary.
[4348.34 → 4349.16] There are, then,
[4349.46 → 4350.54] three ways
[4350.54 → 4351.46] in which Christians
[4351.46 → 4353.22] share and live
[4353.22 → 4354.62] this responsibility
[4354.62 → 4357.14] to obey
[4357.14 → 4359.26] governing authorities.
[4359.48 → 4359.88] And first,
[4360.10 → 4361.32] that is the first.
[4361.40 → 4362.46] Christians obey.
[4362.62 → 4364.06] We start with submission.
[4364.54 → 4365.94] We pay our taxes.
[4366.18 → 4367.86] We act as civil servants.
[4368.02 → 4368.54] We contribute
[4368.54 → 4369.34] to the well-being
[4369.34 → 4370.00] of society.
[4370.38 → 4371.50] We pray for the king
[4371.50 → 4372.54] or the prime minister
[4372.54 → 4373.54] or the president
[4373.54 → 4374.56] or the emperor
[4374.56 → 4375.50] or the mayor
[4375.50 → 4377.10] or the town council member.
[4379.30 → 4379.90] Second,
[4380.88 → 4382.30] Christians submit
[4382.30 → 4384.58] according to conscience.
[4385.82 → 4386.94] Verse 5 says,
[4387.04 → 4387.52] it's necessary
[4387.52 → 4388.58] to admit to the authorities
[4388.58 → 4389.50] not only because
[4389.50 → 4390.40] of possible punishment
[4390.40 → 4391.12] but also
[4391.12 → 4393.26] as a matter of conscience.
[4394.76 → 4396.26] Part of what this means,
[4396.36 → 4396.54] right,
[4396.58 → 4397.56] is that we have to
[4397.56 → 4399.82] evaluate the state
[4399.82 → 4400.66] in our relationship
[4400.66 → 4402.10] to these governing authorities.
[4402.10 → 4402.94] Right?
[4403.10 → 4404.46] Others may obey
[4404.46 → 4406.00] only out of fear
[4406.00 → 4406.80] or out of fear
[4406.80 → 4407.44] of punishment
[4407.44 → 4408.96] but Christians obey
[4408.96 → 4411.02] according to our conscience.
[4411.20 → 4411.86] Christians obey
[4411.86 → 4413.34] because we realize
[4413.34 → 4414.48] that God has established
[4414.48 → 4416.22] these authorities.
[4417.38 → 4418.18] And,
[4418.42 → 4419.64] if Christians
[4419.64 → 4421.10] are to disobey,
[4421.52 → 4422.30] we do so
[4422.30 → 4424.08] according to our consciences
[4424.08 → 4426.12] discerning God's calling.
[4426.12 → 4427.96] And,
[4427.96 → 4428.96] I need you to hear
[4428.96 → 4431.12] just how radical this is.
[4431.86 → 4432.08] Because,
[4432.20 → 4432.82] on the one hand,
[4433.02 → 4434.38] we will obey the state
[4434.38 → 4435.24] even when there are
[4435.24 → 4436.50] no civil consequences
[4436.50 → 4437.86] because our motivation
[4437.86 → 4438.86] for obeying the state
[4438.86 → 4440.50] is obedience to God
[4440.50 → 4442.70] who has established the state.
[4443.58 → 4444.00] And,
[4444.08 → 4444.68] on the other hand,
[4445.34 → 4446.54] we could never submit
[4446.54 → 4447.22] uncritically
[4447.22 → 4447.90] to what the state
[4447.90 → 4448.78] tells us
[4448.78 → 4449.76] because if it requires us
[4449.76 → 4450.80] to violate our conscience,
[4451.08 → 4453.12] we must disobey.
[4453.12 → 4456.12] And,
[4456.32 → 4456.34] then,
[4457.22 → 4458.72] our third point
[4458.72 → 4459.68] moving quickly
[4459.68 → 4460.50] through here.
[4461.40 → 4462.58] Responsible citizens
[4462.58 → 4463.30] do good
[4463.30 → 4465.76] for goodness’s sake.
[4466.42 → 4468.26] This is verse 3.
[4469.40 → 4470.56] Rulers hold no terror
[4470.56 → 4471.62] for those who do right
[4471.62 → 4472.76] but for those who do wrong.
[4473.18 → 4474.02] Do you want to be free
[4474.02 → 4474.58] from fear
[4474.58 → 4475.78] from the one in authority?
[4475.94 → 4477.08] Then do what is right
[4477.08 → 4479.42] and you will be commended.
[4479.42 → 4485.06] Do what is right
[4485.06 → 4486.60] and you will be commended.
[4486.96 → 4487.74] Do good
[4487.74 → 4488.44] as a matter
[4488.44 → 4489.56] of conscience.
[4491.14 → 4492.28] Part of
[4492.28 → 4494.42] Peter's concern
[4494.42 → 4495.64] when he writes his letter,
[4495.72 → 4496.66] which we looked at briefly,
[4496.98 → 4498.96] and that parallels Paul here,
[4499.12 → 4500.36] part of Paul's concern
[4500.36 → 4501.16] when he writes
[4501.16 → 4502.58] and here in Romans
[4502.58 → 4503.66] but also when Paul writes
[4503.66 → 4504.30] to Timothy
[4504.30 → 4506.86] is for the witness
[4506.86 → 4508.46] and the well-being
[4508.46 → 4509.72] of the church.
[4510.26 → 4510.90] That the witness
[4510.90 → 4511.64] and the well-being
[4511.64 → 4512.08] of the church
[4512.08 → 4512.88] would be encouraged.
[4513.42 → 4514.28] The idea here
[4514.28 → 4516.28] is that how we live
[4516.28 → 4517.20] as Christians
[4517.20 → 4518.32] influences
[4518.32 → 4519.78] what others think
[4519.78 → 4520.36] about God
[4520.36 → 4520.86] and what others
[4520.86 → 4521.70] think about Christianity.
[4522.38 → 4523.52] This is also true
[4523.52 → 4524.62] in our relationship
[4524.62 → 4525.26] to the state.
[4527.24 → 4528.44] Paul writes to Timothy
[4528.44 → 4529.08] and he says,
[4529.08 → 4530.68] I urge then,
[4530.90 → 4531.58] first,
[4531.68 → 4532.40] that petitions,
[4532.76 → 4533.12] prayers,
[4533.54 → 4534.26] intercessions,
[4534.38 → 4535.24] and thanksgivings
[4535.24 → 4536.72] be made for all people,
[4536.92 → 4537.74] for kings
[4537.74 → 4539.28] and all those in authority
[4539.28 → 4540.60] that we may live
[4540.60 → 4541.18] peaceful,
[4541.42 → 4542.18] quiet lives
[4542.18 → 4543.00] in all goodness
[4543.00 → 4544.08] and holiness.
[4544.34 → 4545.06] And so I'll ask you
[4545.06 → 4545.68] one more time.
[4547.88 → 4548.76] Have you prayed
[4548.76 → 4550.06] for our political leaders
[4550.06 → 4551.74] as much as you have
[4551.74 → 4552.56] complained about them?
[4555.20 → 4556.26] Simple litmus test.
[4556.26 → 4558.18] I know I fail it.
[4560.96 → 4561.44] In fact,
[4561.50 → 4562.20] I know I failed it
[4562.20 → 4562.86] just this morning
[4562.86 → 4564.44] before the service began
[4564.44 → 4565.76] knowing that I was
[4565.76 → 4566.40] going to say this
[4566.40 → 4566.96] in my sermon.
[4568.08 → 4568.96] That's how easily
[4568.96 → 4569.54] it happens.
[4574.66 → 4575.92] As Paul calls
[4575.92 → 4578.30] for our praying
[4578.30 → 4578.88] for leaders
[4578.88 → 4579.74] and those in authority
[4579.74 → 4580.54] so that we may live
[4580.54 → 4582.00] peaceful and quiet lives
[4582.00 → 4582.44] in goodness
[4582.44 → 4583.06] and holiness,
[4583.34 → 4584.22] the idea there
[4584.22 → 4585.54] is that an atmosphere
[4585.54 → 4586.22] of quiet
[4586.22 → 4587.72] and peaceful living.
[4588.02 → 4589.16] In that kind of atmosphere,
[4589.32 → 4590.48] Christians are free
[4590.48 → 4592.30] to pursue activities
[4592.30 → 4593.32] consistent with
[4593.32 → 4594.54] God's will for his people.
[4594.86 → 4595.58] And this comes back
[4595.58 → 4596.36] to those other spheres
[4596.36 → 4597.02] for the raising
[4597.02 → 4598.42] of families in the Lord,
[4598.50 → 4599.06] for the serving
[4599.06 → 4600.24] of community needs
[4600.24 → 4601.28] and loving neighbours,
[4601.54 → 4602.92] for providing places
[4602.92 → 4603.98] of education
[4603.98 → 4605.18] and institutions
[4605.18 → 4606.18] like schools
[4606.18 → 4607.14] and universities,
[4607.54 → 4607.70] right?
[4607.82 → 4609.24] And for providing
[4609.24 → 4609.76] opportunity
[4609.76 → 4611.08] to love our neighbour
[4611.08 → 4612.24] meeting their needs
[4612.24 → 4613.72] and for providing
[4613.72 → 4614.36] opportunities
[4614.36 → 4615.74] to take the gospel
[4615.74 → 4616.80] to the world.
[4617.62 → 4618.72] All of these things
[4618.72 → 4619.70] are part of the greater
[4619.70 → 4622.18] concern for the witness
[4622.18 → 4623.00] and the well-being
[4623.00 → 4623.84] of the church.
[4625.58 → 4626.26] So in short,
[4626.72 → 4628.26] doing good for goodness’s sake,
[4628.62 → 4630.54] responsible citizens
[4630.54 → 4631.72] will do good
[4631.72 → 4632.72] because it's good
[4632.72 → 4633.34] for the message
[4633.34 → 4633.98] of the church.
[4634.18 → 4635.54] It's good for the well-being
[4635.54 → 4636.58] of the community
[4636.58 → 4637.64] of faith.
[4637.64 → 4641.22] Now I know
[4641.22 → 4644.34] quoting Paul
[4644.34 → 4644.88] is already
[4644.88 → 4646.12] a divisive figure,
[4646.28 → 4646.88] but I'm going to quote
[4646.88 → 4648.20] Preston Manning next,
[4649.12 → 4649.56] which is also
[4649.56 → 4650.90] another divisive figure.
[4652.28 → 4653.36] He's a Canadian politician.
[4654.22 → 4655.06] He was more active
[4655.06 → 4656.44] in the 90s
[4656.44 → 4657.74] and the early 2000s,
[4657.74 → 4658.76] but he was very,
[4658.88 → 4660.00] very vocal
[4660.00 → 4661.16] about the impact
[4661.16 → 4661.88] of his faith
[4661.88 → 4663.04] on his politics.
[4663.32 → 4664.42] And he said,
[4664.42 → 4666.52] for conservatives,
[4667.34 → 4668.48] being right
[4668.48 → 4669.98] must mean more
[4669.98 → 4671.10] than just being
[4671.10 → 4671.92] right of centre.
[4673.34 → 4674.68] It must also mean
[4674.68 → 4675.98] doing the right thing.
[4678.48 → 4679.62] Do good
[4679.62 → 4681.26] for goodness’s sake.
[4682.68 → 4683.14] Lastly,
[4683.58 → 4684.48] the fourth thing
[4684.48 → 4685.94] that responsible citizens do
[4685.94 → 4688.24] is to give equitably
[4688.24 → 4689.52] as it is due,
[4689.72 → 4690.50] or to put it another way,
[4690.56 → 4691.70] to serve diligently
[4691.70 → 4693.00] as is required,
[4693.00 → 4693.86] or to put it another way,
[4694.14 → 4695.24] to seek justice
[4695.24 → 4697.44] as you find injustices,
[4697.66 → 4699.26] to seek the well-being
[4699.26 → 4700.22] of the
[4700.50 → 4701.54] Jeremiah 29,
[4701.80 → 4702.54] 7 says,
[4702.64 → 4703.62] the city that God
[4703.62 → 4704.52] has placed you in.
[4705.22 → 4706.18] And so you pray for it
[4706.18 → 4706.96] and you invest in it
[4706.96 → 4707.52] and you live
[4707.52 → 4708.78] and you are present to you.
[4709.48 → 4710.06] Verse 7,
[4710.34 → 4711.64] give to everyone
[4711.64 → 4712.72] what you owe them.
[4714.50 → 4715.48] So if you owe taxes,
[4715.64 → 4716.24] pay your taxes.
[4716.42 → 4717.26] If you owe revenue,
[4717.70 → 4718.88] then give revenue.
[4719.20 → 4720.08] If it is respect,
[4720.38 → 4721.02] then give respect.
[4721.02 → 4721.96] If it is honour,
[4722.26 → 4723.08] then give honour.
[4724.12 → 4725.54] But you begin to see
[4725.54 → 4727.68] what is stacking here.
[4728.70 → 4728.94] Right?
[4728.98 → 4730.68] That responsible citizenship
[4730.68 → 4731.78] in the world
[4731.78 → 4732.86] recognizes
[4732.86 → 4734.26] that there's a created order.
[4735.56 → 4736.00] Right?
[4736.06 → 4737.76] And then that out of that order
[4737.76 → 4739.98] we are called to do good
[4739.98 → 4741.66] and that in doing good
[4741.66 → 4742.82] we're called to do good
[4742.82 → 4743.84] for goodness’s sake.
[4743.94 → 4744.40] And so yes,
[4744.48 → 4745.60] there are matters of conscience
[4745.60 → 4746.88] to be aware of.
[4746.88 → 4749.46] And then the kind of good
[4749.46 → 4750.40] that we do
[4750.40 → 4753.40] sees a justice,
[4753.64 → 4755.70] a fairness emerge
[4755.70 → 4757.76] in the societies we live in.
[4759.70 → 4762.18] This is part of what it means
[4762.18 → 4765.06] to be a responsible citizen.
[4765.82 → 4767.62] And they all come together
[4767.62 → 4772.88] so that we can honour God
[4772.88 → 4775.30] even as we honour
[4775.30 → 4776.66] the Prime Minister.
[4778.08 → 4779.14] And I'm going to say amen.
[4780.34 → 4781.18] And I say it
[4781.18 → 4783.06] maybe on behalf of you
[4783.06 → 4784.82] who can't yet say it.
[4785.62 → 4785.90] Amen.
[4786.60 → 4787.06] Let's pray.
[4790.94 → 4791.74] Lord our God,
[4792.12 → 4793.88] we come to you
[4793.88 → 4795.40] mindful that
[4795.40 → 4797.16] perhaps our consciences
[4797.16 → 4798.22] have been pricked
[4798.22 → 4798.86] this morning.
[4798.86 → 4799.68] mindful that
[4799.68 → 4801.20] your word
[4801.20 → 4803.56] pierces to the depths
[4803.56 → 4804.78] of our heart.
[4804.94 → 4806.86] And so we pray together
[4806.86 → 4808.18] take the truth
[4808.18 → 4809.18] of your word
[4809.18 → 4810.32] and plant it deep
[4810.32 → 4811.32] within us.
[4812.36 → 4813.06] Take the truths
[4813.06 → 4814.10] of our faith
[4814.10 → 4814.94] and allow us
[4814.94 → 4816.84] to live them well.
[4817.68 → 4818.62] Help us to
[4818.62 → 4820.06] walk by faith
[4820.06 → 4821.10] and not by sight
[4821.10 → 4822.24] in this world
[4822.24 → 4824.12] as responsible citizens.
[4824.12 → 4827.84] and in so doing
[4827.84 → 4828.78] and being,
[4829.00 → 4829.40] Lord God,
[4829.50 → 4831.52] may you be glorified.
[4832.06 → 4833.08] In so doing
[4833.08 → 4833.82] and being,
[4833.98 → 4836.16] may you be magnified
[4836.16 → 4836.96] and praised.
[4837.10 → 4838.60] May you be worshipped
[4838.60 → 4839.80] and may we
[4839.80 → 4841.10] work together
[4841.10 → 4841.88] to reveal
[4841.88 → 4843.06] your kingdom come
[4843.06 → 4845.16] and your kingdom coming.
[4846.54 → 4847.84] This we ask,
[4848.02 → 4848.42] Lord God.
[4849.78 → 4850.88] And so by your grace,
[4851.02 → 4852.20] fill us with gentleness
[4852.20 → 4853.60] and respect.
[4854.20 → 4855.00] And by your grace,
[4855.10 → 4855.76] send us out now
[4855.76 → 4857.96] to serve those around us.
[4858.32 → 4859.42] In your name we pray.
[4859.94 → 4860.28] Amen.
[4860.28 → 4860.40] Amen.
[4882.20 → 4886.00] Amen.
[4886.16 → 4887.22] Amen.
[4887.22 → 4888.02] Amen.
[4888.02 → 4888.10] Amen.
[4888.10 → 4890.20] In your name we pray badges
[4890.20 → 4890.76] and Miriam outfit Tribe.
[4890.76 → 4891.38] Amen.
[4891.54 → 4891.92] Amen.
[4892.32 → 4892.74] Amen.
[4892.74 → 4892.82] Amen.
[4892.82 → 4892.94] Amen.
[4892.94 → 4893.18] Amen.
[4893.18 → 4893.68] Amen.
[4893.92 → 4895.16] So Lord,
[4895.26 → 4896.98] give gain injuries.
[4896.98 → 4897.68] Amen.
[4897.68 → 4898.50] Amen.
[4898.50 → 4899.66] So Lord,
[4899.66 → 4900.92] In your flame let me
[4900.92 → 4901.94] know in this land
