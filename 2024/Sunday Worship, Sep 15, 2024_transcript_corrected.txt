[3329.34 → 3330.34] Thank you.
[3359.34 → 3360.34] Thank you.
[3389.34 → 3390.34] We pray.
[3419.34 → 3420.34] Thank you.
[3449.34 → 3479.34] You have
[3479.34 → 3496.72] It is September, it's the season of beginnings, back to school, back to regular patterns of work
[3496.72 → 3505.42] and life for many people, and for us here as well at church, back into the sort of normal
[3505.42 → 3514.36] patterns of ministry life together. Every year at this time, during this season, we tend to pause for a moment
[3514.36 → 3524.78] and look at what it is that we do and why we do what it is that we do. For us at Emanuel, that is
[3524.78 → 3535.08] summarized really quickly with three words, gather, grow, and go. And so for the next three Sundays,
[3535.54 → 3538.90] we're going to look at each one of those words and what it means for us and how it shapes
[3538.90 → 3546.14] what we do together as a church. And this morning, starting with in that, we're looking at the word
[3546.14 → 3560.48] gather. Why do we gather here? Why do we come together on Sunday or in different days of the week,
[3560.48 → 3565.92] different ministries and different opportunities and different chances to serve? What is it about
[3565.92 → 3577.56] gathering that is important for us? Or maybe you're more likely to wonder, is it important for us?
[3579.20 → 3587.60] I was reflecting on that this morning and realizing that particularly if you are a parent or have
[3587.60 → 3594.88] ever parented young children, right, you might be familiar with the question, why do we have to go
[3594.88 → 3602.22] to church? Now, when I was a kid, it was, why do we have to go to church twice? Some of you remember
[3602.22 → 3609.36] that. Some of you still have trauma recovering from that experience. Why do we have to go to church?
[3609.36 → 3617.04] Do we have to go to church? What's the point of all of that? And to be honest, asking this question
[3617.04 → 3623.98] at a time like this is actually really prescient because as you look around the church in North
[3623.98 → 3631.30] America, a lot of people are saying, I don't have to. It's not that important. It's not a big deal.
[3631.30 → 3640.32] Now, let's be really clear. That is true here in North America. Globally, praise the Lord, that's not
[3640.32 → 3646.26] the case. Globally, the Christian church is still growing at a pace that is incredible to behold.
[3647.24 → 3655.46] But why for us does it continue to matter? And so my prayer this morning, my hope this morning
[3655.46 → 3664.96] is to hold out to you maybe a little bit of a vision for why we must gather. That it's actually
[3664.96 → 3673.30] about something more than just coming to an event. But there's something more going on here.
[3674.16 → 3680.78] And so I want to share with you really quickly, because I am mindful of the time, seven reasons
[3680.78 → 3687.74] why we must gather. And to do that, we're going to do things a little bit differently this morning.
[3687.86 → 3692.42] I'm not going to start with one text and then work our way through that text. I'm going to share with
[3692.42 → 3698.62] you a bunch of texts, and they will be on the screen behind me as we go through together.
[3699.38 → 3705.38] But to make sense of this and to start answering this question, why must we gather, it's actually
[3705.38 → 3710.46] fitting, I think, for us to start at the beginning. And so we're going to start with
[3710.46 → 3723.50] creation, right? In Genesis 1, on the sixth day of creation, God says in Genesis 1 verse 26,
[3723.94 → 3729.80] let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea,
[3729.90 → 3735.38] and the birds in the sky, over the livestock, and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures
[3735.38 → 3742.44] that move along the ground. So God created mankind in his own image. In the image of God,
[3742.52 → 3749.14] he created them. Male and female, he created them. What I want you to hear in there, right,
[3749.18 → 3759.48] is that we are created in the image of God. And so if you're in your Bible, if you flip over a page at the
[3759.48 → 3767.86] end of the first creation story, in Genesis 2 verse 1, we read, thus the heavens and the earth were
[3767.86 → 3774.00] completed in all their vast array, and by the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing.
[3774.36 → 3781.40] So on the seventh day he rested from all his work. Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy,
[3781.40 → 3791.52] because on it, he rested from all the work of creation. And this becomes a pattern, a pattern
[3791.52 → 3799.08] that God calls us to live into as those who are created in his image, right? If you are created in
[3799.08 → 3805.90] the image and likeness of God, and he rests on the seventh day, maybe there's a reason, a creationally
[3805.90 → 3816.06] normative reason for you to rest regularly as well. And in fact, as this works out, this will be
[3816.06 → 3822.54] presented to the people of Israel in the Ten Commandments. And so when the people are rediscovering
[3822.54 → 3828.70] their relationship to God, one of the things that they do is receive from him a law. And in the fourth
[3828.70 → 3838.24] commandment in Exodus 20 verse 8, we read, remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six days you
[3838.24 → 3843.30] shall labour and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you
[3843.30 → 3849.02] shall not do any work, neither you nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your
[3849.02 → 3855.30] animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth,
[3855.30 → 3860.90] the sea and all that is in them. But he rested on the seventh day. Therefore, the Lord blessed the
[3860.90 → 3869.94] Sabbath day and made it holy. But the first reason I want you to see that we are called to gather,
[3870.04 → 3880.86] why we must gather, is that you were made for this. You were made to rest in the Lord. In fact,
[3880.86 → 3887.40] Jesus will affirm this in Mark. He says the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. And so
[3887.40 → 3894.90] part of what's going on here is that God has given you the Sabbath as a way of resting in him. And so
[3894.90 → 3902.10] let me be again clear, it's less about a day and what day, it's more about a practice. It's more about a
[3902.10 → 3910.38] rhythm, right? And very on in the early church in the New Testament, the practice of gathering changed
[3910.38 → 3916.72] from the Sabbath, which is the Saturday, to the Lord's Day. The early church gathers together on
[3916.72 → 3922.34] what's called the Lord's Day because that's Resurrection Sunday. The day that Jesus was
[3922.34 → 3929.18] raised from the dead, the first day of the week, is the day we now gather to worship our God. You were
[3929.18 → 3938.96] made for this rhythm of communal being together. And not only that, right, were you made for this
[3938.96 → 3949.16] from the beginning, it's also your end. It's your tells. It's part of our purpose together. In Revelation 7,
[3949.52 → 3950.46] it says,
[3950.46 → 3958.74] After this, I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count from every
[3958.74 → 3964.76] nation, tribe, and people, and language. Standing before the throne and before the Lamb, they were
[3964.76 → 3970.00] wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands, and they cried out in a loud voice,
[3970.52 → 3975.94] Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne and to the Lamb.
[3975.94 → 3983.36] And not only were you created for this regular rhythm of gathering together with God's people,
[3983.46 → 3993.06] but that is our end, our goal, to worship God and to glorify Him, to stand in His presence with all
[3993.06 → 4000.26] those Christians from around the world throughout time and space and history, and to worship the Lamb.
[4000.26 → 4013.76] You were made for this. And we continue. For the second reason, we're going to look at Ephesians 4.
[4015.64 → 4020.90] Ephesians 4, 15 and 16. We read,
[4021.32 → 4028.22] Speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of Him who is the head
[4028.22 → 4034.54] that is Christ. From Him, the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament,
[4034.66 → 4043.98] grows and builds itself up in love as each part does its work. Now, next week, when Kevin is up here
[4043.98 → 4050.50] preaching, he's going to look at the word grow and how that is part of our purpose and our being
[4050.50 → 4057.16] together. From this text, what I want us to see is that the church is not an event, it is a body.
[4058.22 → 4063.96] And so, even this regular rhythm of gathering together isn't about the event, it's about being
[4063.96 → 4071.76] part of the body. The church is the body of Christ and He is their head. And this isn't just a metaphor,
[4072.12 → 4078.66] this isn't just a word picture, this is actually a spiritual reality for us. Right, over and over and
[4078.66 → 4083.92] over again in the New Testament, this is affirmed, right, that we are the body of Christ by grace
[4083.92 → 4091.76] through faith and that He is our head. Part of what it means to be Christian is to be becoming like
[4091.76 → 4099.12] Jesus. Because what it means to be Christian is to be united to Jesus in His life and in His death and
[4099.12 → 4105.30] in His resurrection. And our individual participation in the divine nature, to use the language of 2 Peter,
[4105.30 → 4114.26] that is becoming as Christ, that happens in the body, right, that's being worked out in the body as a
[4114.26 → 4124.94] whole united to her head. The individual believer's union with Christ makes for a necessary and
[4124.94 → 4134.32] consequent union with others in the body. There ought to be no such thing as an individualistic
[4134.32 → 4143.28] Christian. Because the truth is, right, if the church is Jesus' body, if you want the whole of
[4143.28 → 4152.78] Jesus, you need the church. To be connected to Jesus as your head is simultaneously to be connected
[4152.78 → 4163.48] to others as His body. The church is intended to be a lived example of this spiritual reality.
[4164.32 → 4169.88] The gathered church helps us make sense of the head and who the head is.
[4171.68 → 4178.56] I was thinking about a way to illustrate this, and I was reminded of a story when my kids were really
[4178.56 → 4184.86] young. We were walking as a family into Old Navy and I don't know if you have seen this before, but
[4184.86 → 4190.10] oftentimes when you walk into Old Navy or other clothing stores, there are mannequins at the front,
[4190.10 → 4196.58] right, that have the wares on them. Well, I don't know when this happened, but mannequins today don't
[4196.58 → 4204.12] have heads. And so we walked into Old Navy and one of my kids, really young, they looked up, and they said,
[4204.20 → 4212.24] what is that? Because it wasn't recognizable as a person because it didn't have a head, right?
[4212.24 → 4222.96] In the same way, the church is made recognizable as the church because of our head, because of who Jesus is,
[4222.96 → 4233.34] right? And likewise, Jesus is made recognizable and embodied by the church, by having a body.
[4233.34 → 4249.60] The reason we gather is that the church isn't an event. What we do here isn't just another thing
[4249.60 → 4257.96] or box to check in your week. This is the work and the being and the gathering of the body.
[4257.96 → 4270.48] Next, I want us to look at Hebrews 10. Hebrews 10 verse 24 and 25 says,
[4270.48 → 4281.72] let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together as
[4281.72 → 4287.94] is the habit of some, but encouraging one another and all the more as you see the day approaching.
[4287.96 → 4295.68] As we read this text and as you see it behind me there, let us consider how to stir up one another
[4295.68 → 4300.90] to love and good works, not neglecting meeting together as some are in the habit of doing.
[4301.42 → 4308.08] You see, there's a connection between you showing up and you being stirred up, right? You need to show
[4308.08 → 4316.56] up in order to stir up. One way to think about this, I don't know if you are familiar, in some places
[4316.56 → 4323.06] around the world, usually tropical places, there is an algae that lives in water and it passively,
[4323.12 → 4328.36] it just sits there. But if you run your hand through the water, if you throw a stone in the water,
[4328.46 → 4334.06] it lights up, it illuminates. It's this bioluminescent algae that reacts to being stirred.
[4336.10 → 4342.84] That's what's happening here, right? You need to show up to be stirred up in order to glow up.
[4342.84 → 4347.50] Now, I know glow up means something different in the world today, but I want you to shine like stars
[4347.50 → 4353.94] in the universe, like Paul says in Philippians 2, as you hold out the word of life, right? You need to
[4353.94 → 4360.80] show up in order to be stirred up, right? To love and to good works. Part of what we do here is be
[4360.80 → 4369.58] encouraged to shine like stars. Next, out of this text, what I want you to see, right? That let us
[4369.58 → 4373.68] consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting meeting together,
[4373.78 → 4377.06] as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another. And this last line,
[4377.62 → 4387.72] all the more as you see the day drawing near. Now, in the Bible, the day or the Lord's day
[4387.72 → 4394.42] is a bit of a theologically technical term, anticipating that great day of judgment,
[4394.42 → 4398.70] that great day of the consummation of the kingdom, that great day of Christ's return.
[4399.88 → 4406.50] And what the author of the letter to the Hebrews is saying is that far from gathering together less,
[4407.02 → 4411.48] the closer we get to that day, the more we ought to be gathering together.
[4412.70 → 4417.46] And what we're hearing and seeing here, the fourth reason that we must gather is that the Lord's day
[4417.46 → 4425.40] prepares you for the last day, or that everything we do here is looking forward to that great day.
[4425.46 → 4432.48] But even more than that, right? The Lord's day prepares you, but also it perseveres you, right?
[4432.48 → 4440.02] One of the means by which we are carried and sustained unto that last day is by gathering together.
[4441.56 → 4445.62] Now, I'm going to ask for your grace for a minute because I'm going to nerd out here.
[4445.62 → 4452.56] In our church tradition, the continental reform tradition that we are part of,
[4453.36 → 4458.16] we have three forms of unity, three confessions or statements of faith,
[4458.52 → 4462.88] and the one most often neglected and forgotten is called the canons of Dort.
[4463.56 → 4468.72] Now, when you hear canons of Dort, don't picture massive cannons on top of a castle, right,
[4468.72 → 4474.68] shooting things out. Rather, here, lists and a description of a truth and an idea.
[4475.62 → 4482.50] Canons of Dort, the article 14 of the fourth and fifth main point of doctrine says,
[4482.50 → 4489.54] just as it has pleased God to begin this work of grace in us by the proclamation of the gospel,
[4490.74 → 4497.42] so God preserves, continues, and completes this work by the hearing and reading of the gospel,
[4497.64 → 4503.32] by meditation on it, by its exhortations, threats, and promises, and also by use of the sacraments.
[4503.32 → 4509.98] All right, so just as you become a Christian by grace through faith in believing the gospel,
[4509.98 → 4516.86] you remain a Christian by grace through faith in hearing, practicing, and living the gospel.
[4517.92 → 4524.42] Right, God does this for us, and this right here, this ordinary thing is in fact extraordinary
[4524.42 → 4533.86] because God is using it to persevere you to the end. The Lord's day prepares you and perseveres you
[4533.86 → 4539.66] for the last day. Next, let's jump to John.
[4542.04 → 4549.60] John 13, 34, and 35. Jesus says to his disciples who've gathered around him,
[4549.60 → 4557.18] a new command I give you, love one another. As I have loved you, so must you love one another.
[4558.06 → 4565.04] By this, everyone will know that you are my disciples if you love one another.
[4566.40 → 4576.92] Here's the idea for us, right? Gathering together shows you and others that your love has a greater
[4576.92 → 4579.90] purpose than your life.
[4581.32 → 4586.40] Right, the idea here is that the church isn't just meant to be a new community,
[4586.84 → 4592.20] because there are plenty of those springing up, right? Some of you are part of corn hole communities.
[4593.08 → 4598.22] That wasn't a thing five years ago, right? Some of you are part of pickleball communities.
[4598.22 → 4602.66] That also wasn't a thing five years ago, right? There are all sorts of new communities springing up.
[4602.66 → 4608.18] What's different about this one? The church is meant to be a new kind of community.
[4609.86 → 4616.04] It turns out that the gospel is, in some ways, divine hospitality, right?
[4617.88 → 4625.68] This was said by Sam Alberry and Dane Portland in a book that they wrote called You're Not Crazy.
[4625.68 → 4631.70] They say that the finished work of Christ on the cross is not God's way of saying to us,
[4631.88 → 4636.78] you're now free to go, but it's God's way of saying to us, you are now free to come.
[4637.62 → 4640.34] He's not sending us off, he's inviting us in.
[4642.08 → 4649.10] And the way that we live that kind of love received from God is by loving others in that same way.
[4649.10 → 4656.12] And so part of our gathering here continues in your gathering on Wednesday and Tuesday and Thursday
[4656.12 → 4659.88] as you invite people into your homes, as you invite people into your lives.
[4660.40 → 4666.62] Part of the gathering that we have here, giving our love purpose and showing us true love, right?
[4666.70 → 4668.56] Jesus says in John 15,
[4668.78 → 4674.32] greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one's life for a friend.
[4674.32 → 4680.92] The kind of love, this new kind of community that the church is living and experiencing and sharing
[4680.92 → 4685.62] is one that is willing to die to self for the sake of another.
[4686.18 → 4693.34] One that is willing to sacrifice my comfort or my finances in order to build wealth in Africa.
[4696.24 → 4700.32] This is what we gather to do.
[4700.32 → 4707.96] It turns out, again, Josh Vincent summarized it.
[4708.02 → 4715.30] He said, the local church is God's chief evangelistic strategy for a lost and dying world.
[4716.98 → 4718.20] That's why we gather.
[4719.12 → 4722.78] To show God's love to the world around us.
[4722.78 → 4729.42] To be made more and more able to live that love to the world around us.
[4730.32 → 4738.66] We gather because doing so shows your love has a greater purpose than your life.
[4739.20 → 4743.50] Because your love reveals the love of Jesus.
[4744.04 → 4746.12] A love that took Him to the cross.
[4746.74 → 4753.24] A love that moved Him to keep perfectly the demands and commands of the law in my place.
[4753.24 → 4759.18] A love that moved Him in grace to give me His righteousness.
[4759.48 → 4761.36] To lay that on my shoulders.
[4761.68 → 4768.68] To impute that to me like I am clothed now in Him such that when God looks at me, He sees His Son.
[4770.62 → 4776.74] And even though He died, that same Jesus was raised three days later victorious over sin and death.
[4776.74 → 4779.64] And out of that same love that brought Him down.
[4779.64 → 4781.82] Out of that same love that raised Him up.
[4781.88 → 4785.00] Out of that same love He now loves us.
[4785.18 → 4787.76] That we might love others.
[4788.58 → 4789.80] That's why we gather.
[4790.48 → 4793.74] To be reminded of this truth.
[4798.40 → 4804.04] For our sixth reason, we see Ephesians 3, 10, and 11.
[4804.04 → 4806.34] Where Paul writes,
[4806.34 → 4816.02] His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms.
[4816.20 → 4822.36] According to His eternal purpose that He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[4823.52 → 4825.18] Now this one's easy to miss.
[4826.48 → 4831.48] But there's something mysterious about what happens here.
[4831.48 → 4839.14] Our gathering makes angels and demons look on in wonder.
[4840.04 → 4840.90] Did you catch that?
[4841.72 → 4847.94] That the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms.
[4849.96 → 4852.48] Through the church.
[4854.82 → 4859.38] 1 Peter says that even angels long to look into these things.
[4859.38 → 4865.78] When individual believers gather to glorify Christ together.
[4866.02 → 4870.52] Even the cosmic forces in unseen realms tune in.
[4871.28 → 4873.30] And try to make sense of what's happening here.
[4875.00 → 4878.60] And sometimes I think it's really easy for us to miss that.
[4878.68 → 4880.72] Because our focus is so small.
[4880.80 → 4882.92] Because what's in front of us seems so big.
[4882.92 → 4886.82] In fact, I want to articulate that.
[4889.10 → 4890.16] We have a picture.
[4890.32 → 4891.86] Can we put that picture up on the screen?
[4892.02 → 4892.56] The first one?
[4894.02 → 4895.96] So that's hard to see and make sense of.
[4895.98 → 4896.76] And that's kind of the point.
[4897.88 → 4899.92] But there are dots there.
[4901.16 → 4904.50] Those dots on their own aren't that impressive.
[4904.50 → 4908.28] But when you zoom out.
[4908.38 → 4909.18] Show us the next one.
[4911.00 → 4916.54] Those dots come together to paint a beautiful picture.
[4916.72 → 4920.78] This is a painting called A Sunday on Le Grand At.
[4920.84 → 4925.42] It's by French painter from the 19th century named Georges Seurat.
[4925.42 → 4927.98] And the art form is called pointillism.
[4929.22 → 4933.32] So everything you see there is an individual dot.
[4934.32 → 4937.26] That comes together to make a picture.
[4938.92 → 4939.46] Right?
[4939.60 → 4942.02] That's what's happening when the church gathers.
[4942.14 → 4946.06] And sometimes it's hard for us to see how our little dot matters.
[4946.06 → 4954.28] But in the whole picture, even angels are astounded by what is taking place here.
[4956.54 → 4958.10] That's why we gather.
[4960.26 → 4967.64] And then let's lastly look at 2 Corinthians 3.18.
[4969.44 → 4970.80] There we read.
[4970.80 → 4995.80] As we land this together, here's the last thing I want us to see about why we must gather.
[4995.80 → 5002.40] Because, you see, the local church is an embassy of the high king.
[5004.22 → 5007.16] The local church is an embassy of the high king.
[5007.24 → 5011.26] Now, maybe you're not familiar with how embassies in different countries work.
[5014.44 → 5020.60] If you visit an embassy, the simple understanding is that when you enter the property of the embassy,
[5020.76 → 5022.56] so say you're visiting the embassy in Canada,
[5022.56 → 5026.14] as soon as you cross the property line, you are on Canadian soil.
[5027.50 → 5029.24] Now, it's a little bit more complicated than that.
[5029.34 → 5033.56] And behind it is the principle of infallibility.
[5034.88 → 5035.98] Now, that's a complicated word.
[5036.04 → 5040.02] But what it means is the host country cannot interfere with them
[5040.02 → 5043.08] or take legal action against the embassy or its personnel
[5043.08 → 5047.50] in the same way that they can in local institutions or in their own land.
[5047.50 → 5055.12] Part of why we gather how the church functions as a local embassy of the high king
[5055.12 → 5059.16] is that here in this space and in this place as a church,
[5059.32 → 5061.00] which is a body together,
[5062.00 → 5067.18] you are protected from the powers and principalities of this world.
[5067.94 → 5072.92] This is holy ground where the kingdom of heaven has broken in
[5072.92 → 5076.48] and redefined the very world you live in.
[5078.10 → 5078.90] Jesus says,
[5079.04 → 5081.46] where two or three are gathered in my name,
[5081.82 → 5083.06] there I am among them.
[5083.36 → 5087.32] Now, he's picking up on a long Jewish tradition
[5087.32 → 5091.10] of needing two or three witnesses to establish the truth of something.
[5091.86 → 5094.80] But the witnesses who establish the truth of something
[5094.80 → 5098.26] here are establishing the truth that Jesus is among us.
[5098.56 → 5099.64] The king is here.
[5099.64 → 5105.38] We gather because he is here, and he has called us to this place.
[5105.52 → 5106.40] The king who has said,
[5106.74 → 5109.54] all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[5110.26 → 5114.20] The king who we read in Colossians is the image of the invisible God,
[5114.30 → 5116.24] the firstborn over all creation.
[5116.40 → 5117.24] For by him,
[5117.34 → 5119.62] all things were created in heaven and on earth,
[5119.72 → 5120.70] visible and invisible,
[5120.98 → 5123.62] whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities.
[5123.94 → 5127.38] All things were created through him and for him.
[5127.38 → 5129.44] And he is before all things.
[5129.56 → 5130.14] And in him,
[5130.20 → 5131.64] all things hold together.
[5131.76 → 5133.78] And he is the head of the body,
[5133.86 → 5134.28] the church.
[5134.40 → 5135.34] He is the beginning,
[5135.72 → 5136.88] the firstborn from the dead,
[5137.24 → 5138.42] that in everything,
[5138.70 → 5140.52] he might be preeminent.
[5141.56 → 5142.36] For in him,
[5142.68 → 5145.22] all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell
[5145.22 → 5147.66] and through him to reconcile to himself
[5147.66 → 5148.66] all things,
[5148.78 → 5150.34] whether on earth or in heaven,
[5150.72 → 5153.08] making peace by the blood of the cross.
[5153.16 → 5154.36] This is our king.
[5154.36 → 5157.30] This is our king.
[5157.36 → 5159.54] And he has called us to this place.
[5160.98 → 5161.92] And in fact,
[5162.32 → 5166.94] even as we stand now on embassy ground,
[5167.28 → 5169.10] we long for that one day
[5169.10 → 5171.60] where the kingdom of heaven will spill out
[5171.60 → 5173.42] and cover the whole earth.
[5173.84 → 5173.92] Right?
[5173.96 → 5175.48] The final vision where we began
[5175.48 → 5177.28] says in Revelation 19,
[5177.58 → 5178.50] verse 16,
[5178.62 → 5178.78] it says,
[5178.78 → 5180.56] on his robe and on his thigh,
[5180.66 → 5181.68] he has the name written,
[5181.86 → 5182.88] King of Kings
[5182.88 → 5185.24] and Lord of Lords.
[5185.34 → 5186.68] The gathering of the church
[5186.68 → 5188.82] is an outpost of heaven.
[5190.00 → 5191.16] That's why we gather.
[5192.18 → 5193.94] The local church is an embassy
[5193.94 → 5195.50] of the high king.
[5196.58 → 5196.70] Right?
[5196.70 → 5197.60] This is why we gather.
[5197.84 → 5198.82] And it's amazing
[5198.82 → 5199.82] and mysterious
[5199.82 → 5200.90] and miraculous.
[5200.90 → 5202.14] And I pray
[5202.14 → 5203.78] that it is compelling.
[5205.52 → 5206.00] Right?
[5206.06 → 5206.74] And as you take
[5206.74 → 5208.00] one of these reasons
[5208.00 → 5208.74] or as you take
[5208.74 → 5209.46] all of them,
[5209.48 → 5210.74] and I pray that you remember
[5210.74 → 5211.66] even just one
[5211.66 → 5213.36] and you have conversation this week
[5213.36 → 5214.42] even about just one
[5214.42 → 5215.38] when someone says,
[5215.52 → 5216.46] why do you go to church?
[5216.62 → 5217.62] Take one of these.
[5218.38 → 5219.38] But I also pray
[5219.38 → 5220.32] that it changes
[5220.32 → 5221.72] the way you come.
[5222.22 → 5223.36] It changes the way
[5223.36 → 5224.52] you prepare to come.
[5225.02 → 5225.12] Right?
[5225.18 → 5226.34] And instead of
[5226.34 → 5228.10] do we have to go to church?
[5228.34 → 5228.56] Right?
[5228.56 → 5229.48] Maybe it becomes
[5229.48 → 5231.78] even angels want to be part
[5231.78 → 5232.72] of what's happening here.
[5233.52 → 5234.68] And so I'm going to go
[5234.68 → 5237.10] with excitement and joy.
[5238.24 → 5239.08] Instead of,
[5239.30 → 5239.48] you know,
[5239.54 → 5241.14] I don't get anything out of it.
[5241.26 → 5241.50] Right?
[5241.52 → 5242.24] This is a chance
[5242.24 → 5243.66] to visibly lay down
[5243.66 → 5244.44] your preferences
[5244.44 → 5245.56] and your priorities
[5245.56 → 5246.70] for the body.
[5246.70 → 5247.20] Right?
[5247.44 → 5248.66] And to worship
[5248.66 → 5252.00] our shared head.
[5253.42 → 5254.56] Instead of
[5254.56 → 5255.94] maybe church is boring.
[5256.34 → 5256.44] Right?
[5256.64 → 5257.96] Gathering is the means
[5257.96 → 5258.68] by which God
[5258.68 → 5260.42] holds onto you
[5260.42 → 5261.38] until the end.
[5265.52 → 5266.70] I mentioned at the beginning
[5266.70 → 5268.46] that here
[5268.46 → 5269.32] in this
[5269.32 → 5270.86] part of the world
[5270.86 → 5271.88] we are living in a time
[5271.88 → 5272.48] that is seeing
[5272.48 → 5275.36] almost unprecedented
[5275.36 → 5276.42] decline
[5276.42 → 5278.12] in church
[5278.12 → 5278.92] gathering
[5278.92 → 5279.90] and participation
[5279.90 → 5282.82] for a number of reasons.
[5284.54 → 5285.18] And after
[5285.18 → 5286.42] the COVID pandemic
[5286.42 → 5287.60] those numbers
[5287.60 → 5288.88] never picked back up
[5288.88 → 5290.14] in our
[5290.14 → 5292.48] North American West.
[5294.02 → 5294.68] There's a book
[5294.68 → 5295.54] that I read recently
[5295.54 → 5296.66] called
[5296.66 → 5297.90] The Great Dechurching
[5297.90 → 5299.32] by Davis and Graham
[5299.32 → 5299.92] and Burke
[5299.92 → 5301.62] and they end
[5301.62 → 5302.80] that with a note
[5302.80 → 5303.40] of hope.
[5304.76 → 5305.62] Because at the end
[5305.62 → 5306.06] of their
[5306.06 → 5307.96] sociological analysis
[5307.96 → 5308.98] of what was going on
[5308.98 → 5310.92] they also said
[5310.92 → 5312.50] that there is
[5312.50 → 5313.82] reason for
[5313.82 → 5314.60] hope
[5314.60 → 5315.10] because
[5315.10 → 5316.92] of how
[5316.92 → 5318.22] we can now
[5318.22 → 5320.24] reimagine
[5320.24 → 5321.02] and
[5321.02 → 5322.36] re-bolster
[5322.36 → 5323.62] our understanding
[5323.62 → 5324.92] of why we must
[5324.92 → 5325.66] gather.
[5326.94 → 5327.70] And they said
[5327.70 → 5328.68] in their interviewing
[5328.68 → 5329.82] and work
[5329.82 → 5330.98] that
[5330.98 → 5332.72] it actually
[5332.72 → 5334.18] wouldn't take
[5334.18 → 5335.44] that much
[5335.44 → 5336.42] in many cases
[5336.42 → 5337.72] to get people
[5337.72 → 5338.70] to come to church
[5338.70 → 5339.78] or come back
[5339.78 → 5340.30] to church.
[5341.10 → 5341.88] In fact
[5341.88 → 5342.36] they said
[5342.36 → 5343.62] that 28%
[5343.62 → 5344.10] of people
[5344.10 → 5344.62] asked
[5344.62 → 5346.44] would come back
[5346.44 → 5347.54] only because
[5347.54 → 5348.12] the desire
[5348.12 → 5348.68] to make new
[5348.68 → 5349.08] friends
[5349.08 → 5350.08] was enough.
[5351.74 → 5353.08] 17%
[5353.08 → 5354.20] that all
[5354.20 → 5354.78] it would take
[5354.78 → 5355.24] is a friend
[5355.24 → 5355.90] inviting them.
[5357.22 → 5358.28] Another 17%
[5358.28 → 5359.10] said that
[5359.10 → 5359.64] what they're
[5359.64 → 5360.12] looking for
[5360.12 → 5360.46] is a good
[5360.46 → 5360.94] community.
[5362.10 → 5362.42] And if they
[5362.42 → 5362.74] could find
[5362.74 → 5363.36] that somewhere
[5363.36 → 5364.16] that would
[5364.16 → 5364.96] be reason enough.
[5364.96 → 5366.32] 16%
[5366.32 → 5367.18] said that
[5367.18 → 5367.48] they would
[5367.48 → 5367.88] go back
[5367.88 → 5368.22] if their
[5368.22 → 5368.52] kids
[5368.52 → 5369.16] invited them.
[5370.72 → 5371.70] Another 18%
[5371.70 → 5372.16] said they
[5372.16 → 5372.66] would go back
[5372.66 → 5372.94] if their
[5372.94 → 5373.34] spouse
[5373.34 → 5374.68] invited them.
[5377.18 → 5377.92] Here's the
[5377.92 → 5378.54] reality we
[5378.54 → 5379.22] find ourselves
[5379.22 → 5379.54] in.
[5381.70 → 5382.30] Sometimes
[5382.30 → 5383.98] all you
[5383.98 → 5384.64] have to do
[5384.64 → 5385.84] is said
[5385.84 → 5386.80] this is why
[5386.80 → 5387.38] I gather.
[5389.42 → 5390.08] And so
[5390.08 → 5390.40] how would you
[5390.40 → 5390.78] answer that
[5390.78 → 5391.16] question?
[5393.14 → 5394.10] And maybe
[5394.10 → 5394.92] sometimes
[5394.92 → 5395.40] all you
[5395.40 → 5395.64] have to
[5395.64 → 5395.92] do
[5395.92 → 5397.18] is asked.
[5398.24 → 5398.70] Would you
[5398.70 → 5399.02] like to
[5399.02 → 5399.28] gather?
[5400.84 → 5401.42] Would you
[5401.42 → 5401.86] like to
[5401.86 → 5402.62] participate in
[5402.62 → 5403.10] something that
[5403.10 → 5404.18] even angels
[5404.18 → 5405.42] long to
[5405.42 → 5405.84] understand?
[5407.04 → 5407.54] Would you
[5407.54 → 5407.84] like to
[5407.84 → 5408.18] know a
[5408.18 → 5408.80] love that
[5408.80 → 5409.40] changes
[5409.40 → 5410.60] everything
[5410.60 → 5411.36] about whom
[5411.36 → 5411.76] you are?
[5412.64 → 5413.44] That's what's
[5413.44 → 5414.12] happening here
[5414.12 → 5414.72] and that
[5414.72 → 5415.44] is why
[5415.44 → 5416.12] we
[5416.12 → 5417.08] gather.
[5417.72 → 5418.02] And I
[5418.02 → 5418.38] pray that
[5418.38 → 5418.60] as we
[5418.60 → 5419.14] begin this
[5419.14 → 5419.50] ministry
[5419.50 → 5420.28] year and
[5420.28 → 5420.56] as we
[5420.56 → 5420.98] see it
[5420.98 → 5421.36] through
[5421.36 → 5422.04] that
[5422.04 → 5422.38] Lord
[5422.38 → 5422.76] willing
[5422.76 → 5423.12] we
[5423.12 → 5423.48] would
[5423.48 → 5424.04] gather
[5424.04 → 5424.88] with
[5424.88 → 5425.58] conviction
[5425.58 → 5426.74] and energy
[5426.74 → 5427.76] and boldness
[5427.76 → 5428.04] and that
[5428.04 → 5428.58] our gathering
[5428.58 → 5429.34] here would
[5429.34 → 5430.08] spill out
[5430.08 → 5431.12] into gatherings
[5431.12 → 5432.08] every other
[5432.08 → 5433.06] day of the
[5433.06 → 5433.34] week.
[5433.68 → 5434.56] Because this
[5434.56 → 5435.20] is how
[5435.20 → 5435.98] God is
[5435.98 → 5436.64] making himself
[5436.64 → 5437.36] known here
[5437.36 → 5439.04] and out
[5439.04 → 5439.28] there.
[5440.80 → 5441.54] And that's
[5441.54 → 5441.92] what we want,
[5441.98 → 5442.12] right?
[5443.30 → 5443.58] Amen.
[5443.72 → 5444.08] Thank you.
[5444.44 → 5444.96] That was the
[5444.96 → 5445.52] right time to
[5445.52 → 5446.00] say amen.
[5446.50 → 5446.94] And I'm
[5446.94 → 5447.28] going to echo
[5447.28 → 5447.54] it.
[5448.06 → 5448.30] Amen.
[5448.94 → 5449.34] Let's pray
[5449.34 → 5449.64] together.
[5451.36 → 5452.20] God you
[5452.20 → 5453.20] are good
[5453.20 → 5454.12] and so
[5454.12 → 5454.86] gather us
[5454.86 → 5455.76] together.
[5456.26 → 5456.82] God you
[5456.82 → 5457.26] are good
[5457.26 → 5457.58] and you
[5457.58 → 5457.90] have
[5457.90 → 5458.30] gathered
[5458.30 → 5458.74] us
[5458.74 → 5459.52] together.
[5460.66 → 5461.16] And so
[5461.16 → 5461.48] I pray
[5461.48 → 5461.96] now that
[5461.96 → 5462.34] as we
[5462.34 → 5462.84] move to
[5462.84 → 5463.34] the table
[5463.34 → 5464.56] that you
[5464.56 → 5464.76] would
[5464.76 → 5465.26] continue
[5465.26 → 5465.96] this
[5465.96 → 5466.88] gathering.
[5467.62 → 5468.10] That we
[5468.10 → 5468.44] would move
[5468.44 → 5468.70] to the
[5468.70 → 5469.24] table and
[5469.24 → 5470.14] receive from
[5470.14 → 5471.04] you the
[5471.04 → 5471.88] grace of
[5471.88 → 5472.72] your word
[5472.72 → 5473.56] made
[5473.56 → 5474.38] tangible.
[5475.62 → 5476.34] That we
[5476.34 → 5476.66] would move
[5476.66 → 5476.92] to the
[5476.92 → 5477.44] table and
[5477.44 → 5477.66] that we
[5477.66 → 5478.22] would receive
[5478.22 → 5478.84] from you
[5478.84 → 5480.36] the opportunity
[5480.36 → 5481.06] to grow
[5481.06 → 5481.48] by the
[5481.48 → 5482.02] truth of
[5482.02 → 5482.56] the gospel
[5482.56 → 5483.30] as we
[5483.30 → 5483.98] taste and
[5483.98 → 5484.64] see that
[5484.64 → 5485.48] you are
[5485.48 → 5486.02] good.
[5487.40 → 5488.00] God this
[5488.00 → 5488.40] day,
[5488.72 → 5490.68] this gathering
[5490.68 → 5491.74] is more
[5491.74 → 5492.44] than an
[5492.44 → 5492.86] event.
[5493.12 → 5493.56] It is the
[5493.56 → 5494.68] body doing
[5494.68 → 5495.18] what the
[5495.18 → 5496.24] body does.
[5496.42 → 5496.72] And so
[5496.72 → 5497.40] meet us
[5497.40 → 5498.22] now at
[5498.22 → 5499.06] your feast
[5499.06 → 5499.74] Lord Jesus.
[5500.48 → 5500.88] We pray
[5500.88 → 5501.26] this in
[5501.26 → 5501.60] your name
[5501.60 → 5501.96] alone.
[5502.80 → 5503.12] Amen.
[5503.12 → 5503.20] Amen.
[5503.20 → 5508.16] as we
[5508.16 → 5508.84] come to
[5508.84 → 5509.26] the table
[5509.26 → 5509.64] together
[5509.64 → 5510.04] we have
[5510.04 → 5510.48] some
[5510.48 → 5511.42] liturgy
[5511.42 → 5511.74] that we
[5511.74 → 5512.16] will move
[5512.16 → 5512.48] through
[5512.48 → 5514.10] and in
[5514.10 → 5514.36] moving
[5514.36 → 5514.76] through
[5514.76 → 5515.78] this
[5515.78 → 5516.52] liturgy
[5516.52 → 5520.36] we will
[5520.36 → 5520.84] have words
[5520.84 → 5521.38] to speak
[5521.38 → 5522.64] both for
[5522.64 → 5523.44] you together
[5523.44 → 5525.04] and to
[5525.04 → 5525.84] reflect on
[5525.84 → 5526.32] as they
[5526.32 → 5527.16] are spoken
[5527.16 → 5527.96] over us.
[5528.58 → 5528.96] So I
[5528.96 → 5529.40] invite you
[5529.40 → 5530.02] to join
[5530.02 → 5530.52] in this
[5530.52 → 5531.00] liturgy
[5531.00 → 5531.86] of the
[5531.86 → 5532.14] table.
[5532.30 → 5532.82] Lift
[5532.82 → 5533.48] your hearts.
[5536.08 → 5536.82] Let us
[5536.82 → 5537.32] give thanks
[5537.32 → 5537.66] to the
[5537.66 → 5538.08] Lord our
[5538.08 → 5538.42] God.
[5541.00 → 5541.58] Let's
[5541.58 → 5542.12] pray together.
[5543.22 → 5544.20] With joy
[5544.20 → 5544.88] we praise
[5544.88 → 5545.30] you
[5545.30 → 5545.80] gracious
[5545.80 → 5546.30] God
[5546.30 → 5547.18] for you
[5547.18 → 5547.40] have
[5547.40 → 5547.86] created
[5547.86 → 5548.34] heaven
[5548.34 → 5549.48] and earth
[5549.48 → 5550.24] and have
[5550.24 → 5550.94] made us
[5550.94 → 5551.52] in your
[5551.52 → 5551.94] image
[5551.94 → 5552.46] and kept
[5552.46 → 5552.90] covenant
[5552.90 → 5553.46] with us
[5553.46 → 5553.86] even
[5553.86 → 5554.72] when we
[5554.72 → 5555.26] fell into
[5555.26 → 5555.54] sin.
[5556.40 → 5556.94] We give
[5556.94 → 5557.42] you thank
[5557.42 → 5557.94] for Jesus
[5557.94 → 5558.42] Christ
[5558.42 → 5559.00] who by
[5559.00 → 5559.76] his life
[5559.76 → 5560.16] death
[5560.16 → 5560.64] and
[5560.64 → 5561.12] resurrection
[5561.12 → 5561.88] open to
[5561.88 → 5562.40] us the
[5562.40 → 5563.04] way of
[5563.04 → 5563.54] life
[5563.54 → 5564.58] everlasting.
[5565.42 → 5565.74] Amen.
[5567.86 → 5568.48] Our
[5568.48 → 5569.32] Lord Jesus
[5569.32 → 5570.22] before he
[5570.22 → 5570.60] suffered
[5570.60 → 5571.42] gave us
[5571.42 → 5571.74] this
[5571.74 → 5572.30] memorial
[5572.30 → 5573.22] of his
[5573.22 → 5573.84] sacrifice
[5573.84 → 5574.64] until he
[5574.64 → 5575.32] comes again.
[5576.26 → 5576.50] And the
[5576.50 → 5577.04] Lord Jesus
[5577.04 → 5577.62] on the
[5577.62 → 5578.04] night that
[5578.04 → 5578.64] he was
[5578.64 → 5579.14] betrayed
[5579.14 → 5580.26] took bread
[5580.26 → 5581.00] and when
[5581.00 → 5581.20] he had
[5581.20 → 5581.90] given thanks
[5581.90 → 5583.00] he broke
[5583.00 → 5583.36] it and
[5583.36 → 5583.88] said this
[5583.88 → 5584.52] is my
[5584.52 → 5584.96] body
[5584.96 → 5585.58] which is
[5585.58 → 5586.04] for you.
[5586.66 → 5587.28] Do this
[5587.28 → 5588.10] in remembrance
[5588.10 → 5589.20] of me.
[5590.42 → 5591.00] And in
[5591.00 → 5591.36] the same
[5591.36 → 5592.10] way he
[5592.10 → 5592.50] took the
[5592.50 → 5592.88] cup
[5592.88 → 5594.18] after supper
[5594.18 → 5595.08] saying this
[5595.08 → 5595.90] cup is
[5595.90 → 5596.32] the new
[5596.32 → 5596.68] covenant
[5596.68 → 5597.20] in my
[5597.20 → 5597.56] blood.
[5598.64 → 5599.20] Do this
[5599.20 → 5599.88] whenever you
[5599.88 → 5600.40] drink it
[5600.40 → 5601.26] in remembrance
[5601.26 → 5602.18] of me.
[5603.86 → 5604.82] For whenever
[5604.82 → 5605.36] you eat
[5605.36 → 5606.06] this bread
[5606.06 → 5607.12] and drink
[5607.12 → 5607.92] this cup
[5607.92 → 5609.04] you proclaim
[5609.04 → 5609.78] the Lord's
[5609.78 → 5610.10] death
[5610.10 → 5611.00] until he
[5611.00 → 5611.46] comes
[5611.46 → 5612.26] again.
[5612.92 → 5613.58] This
[5613.58 → 5614.30] is the
[5614.30 → 5614.74] mystery
[5614.74 → 5615.44] of our
[5615.44 → 5615.82] faith.
[5620.10 → 5620.70] Your
[5620.70 → 5621.22] resurrection
[5621.22 → 5622.10] we affirm
[5622.10 → 5622.82] with joy.
[5623.58 → 5623.82] Your
[5623.82 → 5624.22] coming
[5624.22 → 5624.96] we await
[5624.96 → 5625.54] with hope.
[5626.34 → 5627.16] Glory be
[5627.16 → 5627.64] to you
[5627.64 → 5628.34] Lord Jesus.
[5629.50 → 5630.08] Church
[5630.08 → 5630.40] family
[5630.40 → 5631.38] the Lord
[5631.38 → 5632.22] has prepared
[5632.22 → 5632.78] his table
[5632.78 → 5633.22] for all
[5633.22 → 5633.70] who love
[5633.70 → 5634.46] him and
[5634.46 → 5635.00] trust in
[5635.00 → 5635.74] him alone
[5635.74 → 5636.22] for their
[5636.22 → 5636.68] salvation.
[5637.38 → 5637.70] And so
[5637.70 → 5638.32] come to
[5638.32 → 5638.92] this table
[5638.92 → 5639.44] you who
[5639.44 → 5640.00] have much
[5640.00 → 5640.60] faith and
[5640.60 → 5640.94] you who
[5640.94 → 5641.26] would like
[5641.26 → 5641.56] to have
[5641.56 → 5641.84] more.
[5642.26 → 5642.70] Come to
[5642.70 → 5643.30] this table
[5643.30 → 5643.84] you who
[5643.84 → 5644.28] have been
[5644.28 → 5644.62] to the
[5644.62 → 5645.00] sacrament
[5645.00 → 5646.04] often and

[5655.60 → 5656.50] Christ is

[5875.92 → 5905.90] Thank you.
[5905.92 → 5935.90] Thank you.
[5935.92 → 5950.60] Speak, O Lord, as we come to you to receive the word of your holy word.
[5950.60 → 5964.60] Take your truth, plant it deep in us, shape and fashion us in your lovingness.
[5964.60 → 5972.60] That the light of Christ might be seen today.
[5972.60 → 5980.60] In our acts of love and our deeds of faith.
[5980.60 → 5996.60] Speak, O Lord, and fulfill in us all your purposes for your holy word.
[5996.60 → 6010.60] Teach us, Lord, teach us, Lord, full obedience.
[6010.60 → 6018.60] Holy remembrance, holy remembrance, true humility.

[6036.60 → 6048.60] God's our faith to see your majestic love and authority.
[6048.60 → 6056.60] Words of God, that can never fail.
[6056.60 → 6064.60] That can truly prevail over unto you.
[6064.60 → 6072.60] God's grace, O Lord, and our hearts, and our hearts, and our hearts, and our hearts, and our hearts.
[6072.60 → 6090.60] Executive order of your life, always, and our hearts, and our hearts, and your hearts, and our hearts, and our hearts, and our hearts.
[6090.60 → 6092.60] from the dawn
[6120.60 → 6123.50] till your church
[6123.50 → 6124.48] is built
[6124.48 → 6126.48] and the earth
[6126.48 → 6128.36] is built
[6128.36 → 6129.82] with your
[6129.82 → 6132.10] glory
[6132.10 → 6133.92] in you
[6150.60 → 6176.34] o deep
[6176.34 → 6180.68] the Father's mouth for us.
[6180.68 → 6186.26] How vast beyond all measure
[6186.26 → 6193.62] that we should give his only Son
[6193.62 → 6199.38] to make our riches treasure.
[6199.38 → 6207.72] How great the pain of searing loss
[6207.72 → 6214.34] the Father turns his face away
[6214.34 → 6221.30] as wounds which bar the chosen one
[6221.30 → 6226.82] bring many sons to glory.
[6229.38 → 6231.38] Amen.
[6238.60 → 6244.82] Behold the man upon the cross
[6244.82 → 6250.72] I sit upon his shoulders
[6250.72 → 6257.78] Ashamed I hear my mocking voice
[6257.78 → 6264.18] Called out among the strong words
[6264.18 → 6270.68] It was my sin that held him there
[6270.68 → 6275.78] Until it was accomplished
[6275.78 → 6282.78] His dying breath has brought me life
[6282.78 → 6288.78] I know that it is finished
[6288.78 → 6306.18] I will not boast in anything
[6306.18 → 6313.18] No gifts, no power, no wisdom
[6313.18 → 6321.18] But I will boast in Jesus Christ
[6321.18 → 6325.18] His death and resurrection
[6325.18 → 6332.18] Why should I think of his reward
[6332.18 → 6339.18] I cannot give an answer
[6339.18 → 6346.18] But this I know with all my heart
[6346.18 → 6353.18] His wounds have paid my ransom
[6353.18 → 6358.18] Why should I gain from his reward
[6358.18 → 6365.18] I cannot give an answer
[6365.18 → 6371.18] But this I know with all my heart
[6371.18 → 6373.18] His wounds have paid my ransom
[6373.18 → 6380.18] His wounds have paid my ransom
[6380.18 → 6381.18] I can't give an answer
[6381.18 → 6382.18] I know with all my heart
[6382.18 → 6383.18] My heart is a blessing
[6383.18 → 6384.18] I know with all my heart
[6384.18 → 6385.18] I can give an answer
[6385.18 → 6387.18] I can give an answer
[6387.18 → 6389.18] I can give an answer
[6389.18 → 6395.18] I can give an answer
[6395.18 → 6397.18] But if I can give an answer
[6397.18 → 6400.18] Like a
[6400.18 → 6401.18] I remain witted
[6401.18 → 6403.18] I think I'll make one of the best
[6403.18 → 6410.18] I will not ignore
[6410.18 → 6437.10] Before the throne of God above, I have a strong and perfect queen.
[6437.10 → 6447.48] The great high priest whose name is love, whoever lives and leads for me.
[6447.48 → 6457.94] My name is written on its hands, my name is written on its heart.
[6457.94 → 6468.38] I know that while in heaven he stands, no tongue can in heaven's deep heart.
[6468.38 → 6473.38] No tongue can live weak as deep heart.
[6473.38 → 6491.38] When Satan tends me to despair and tells me of the guilt within,
[6491.38 → 6502.64] a word I look and see in there, who made a death of all my sin.
[6502.98 → 6512.38] Because the sinless Saviour died, my sinful soul is counted free.
[6512.38 → 6523.54] For God the justice satisfied, to look on him and pardon me.
[6523.54 → 6530.54] To look on him and pardon me.
[6530.54 → 6537.54] For God the justice of God above, I have a strong and perfect love.
[6537.54 → 6547.54] Behold him there, the risen land, my perfect spotless righteousness,
[6547.54 → 6558.54] the great unchangeable I am, the King of glory and of grace.
[6558.54 → 6563.54] For God the justice of God above, I have a strong and perfect love.
[6563.54 → 6579.62] For God the justice of God above, I have a strong and perfect love.
[6579.62 → 6585.58] With Christ my Saviour and my God
[6585.58 → 6591.12] I'll make himself I cannot die
[6591.12 → 6596.60] My soul is purchased by his blood
[6596.60 → 6602.10] My life is hid with Christ on high
[6602.10 → 6607.82] With Christ my Saviour and my God
[6607.82 → 6614.70] With Christ my Saviour and my God
[6637.82 → 6665.26] All these pieces broken and scattered
[6665.26 → 6672.14] In mercy gathered, mended and whole
[6672.14 → 6679.02] Empty-handed but not forsaken
[6679.02 → 6685.90] I've been set free, I've been set free
[6685.90 → 6694.46] The amazing grace of sweet the sound
[6694.46 → 6699.66] That saved a wretch like me
[6699.66 → 6704.54] Oh, I once was lost
[6704.54 → 6708.04] But now I am found
[6708.04 → 6712.22] It's fine, but now I see
[6712.22 → 6717.10] Oh, I can see you now
[6717.10 → 6726.48] Oh, I can see the love in your eyes
[6726.48 → 6731.10] Laying yourself down
[6731.10 → 6737.98] Raising up the moment
[6737.98 → 6740.86] To die
[6740.86 → 6756.86] You take our failure
[6756.86 → 6760.36] You take our weakness
[6760.36 → 6767.24] You set your treasure in charge of the flame
[6767.24 → 6771.12] So, I'll take this while, Lord
[6771.12 → 6774.12] I'll be your best soul
[6774.12 → 6777.12] The world will see
[6777.12 → 6781.00] Your life in me
[6781.00 → 6785.42] Amazing grace
[6785.42 → 6788.30] How sweet the sound
[6788.30 → 6788.80] How sweet the sound
[6788.80 → 6793.30] That saved a wretch like me
[6793.30 → 6798.68] Oh, I once was lost
[6798.68 → 6802.10] But now I am found
[6802.10 → 6806.48] Just by the love now I see
[6806.48 → 6810.98] Oh, I can see you now
[6810.98 → 6820.62] Oh, I can see the love in your eyes
[6820.62 → 6824.98] Laying yourself down
[6824.98 → 6833.24] Praising up the broken to the earth
[6833.24 → 6863.22] Oh, my God.
[6863.24 → 6873.24] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[6873.94 → 6886.30] Oh, I once was lost, but now I am found, was mine, but now I see.
[6886.30 → 6912.30] Oh, I once was lost, but now I am found, was mine, but now I see.
[6912.30 → 6917.30] Oh, I can see you now.
[6919.30 → 6925.30] Oh, I can see the love in your eyes.
[6925.30 → 6931.30] Lay yourself down.
[6931.30 → 6961.30] 
[6961.30 → 6967.30] Open to my heart.
[6967.30 → 6996.88] The final part of why we gather is so that we can scatter in the power of God's name and with the truth of the gospel to proclaim.
[6997.88 → 7002.90] But as we have met God in this place, his promise is that he goes with us.
[7003.40 → 7008.30] And so receive the blessing of our God for the journey of faith ahead.
[7008.30 → 7011.68] God go before you to lead you.
[7012.30 → 7014.46] God go behind you to protect you.
[7014.82 → 7017.08] God go beneath you to support you.
[7017.38 → 7020.32] And God goes beside you to befriend you.
[7020.92 → 7022.22] Do not be afraid.
[7022.72 → 7024.62] Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[7024.74 → 7026.38] Do not be afraid.
[7026.96 → 7031.30] But go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
[7031.72 → 7032.66] Amen.
[7032.66 → 7032.90] Amen.
[7062.66 → 7068.00] And we pray that all unity may one day be restored.
[7070.70 → 7076.34] And they'll know we are Christians by our love, by our love.
[7076.34 → 7081.38] Yes, they'll know we are Christians by our love.
[7084.00 → 7087.20] We will walk with each other.
[7087.36 → 7089.70] We will walk hand in hand.
[7089.70 → 7092.60] We will walk with each other.
[7092.74 → 7095.08] We will walk hand in hand.
[7095.08 → 7101.08] And together we'll strengthen it that God is in our land.
[7103.42 → 7108.90] And they'll know we are Christians by our love, by our love.
[7109.04 → 7113.38] Yes, they'll know we are Christians by our love.
[7113.38 → 7119.66] We will walk with each other.
[7119.76 → 7122.26] We will walk side by side.
