[2156.82 → 2157.82] Good morning.
[2157.82 → 2158.82] I'm going to invite Jim
[2158.82 → 2164.10] going to invite Jim up and Jim is here from the Langley Food Bank and our church has a pretty
[2164.10 → 2168.02] awesome long-standing relationship with the food bank a bunch of people volunteer there and most
[2168.02 → 2174.16] recently we held a bit of a community festival where we also did and ran a big food drive
[2174.16 → 2179.28] throughout Durbanville so that was this past July and Jim is here to share a few words about the
[2179.28 → 2189.96] food bank and yeah, thank you for joining us today thank you for having me greetings from the Langley
[2189.96 → 2196.08] Food Bank and I just want to come and give God the glory for what he's doing I don't know if recently
[2196.08 → 2201.72] a lot of new things have happened, and you know Isaiah says forget the former things do not dwell
[2201.72 → 2207.72] on them see I am doing a new thing, and he's doing a new thing at the Langley Food Bank I'm not sure if
[2207.72 → 2213.68] you're aware of that uh 2 Corinthians 5 17 says therefore if any men in Christ he's a new
[2213.68 → 2219.72] creature the old is gone the new has come and so there are a couple new things that have happened
[2219.72 → 2224.64] to Langley Food Bank that you should know about number one they have a new executive manager
[2224.64 → 2229.10] that's right I used to be the old one, but I retired my wife finally got the better of me
[2229.10 → 2236.04] and she said honey it's time, so I am retired from full-time work I'm doing part-time as the vice
[2236.04 → 2242.36] president of public relations, so I even have a card to prove it so which is pretty cool, so I'm enjoying
[2242.36 → 2249.28] my retirement from full-time work, but this is one of those things I really still enjoy doing the next
[2249.28 → 2258.00] one should be that's the new guy that's Josh Mace he's our executive manager now, and I know Josh really
[2258.00 → 2266.64] well Josh and my son Thomas were basically in the same nursery many years ago and Josh is 40 years
[2266.64 → 2274.24] old, so there are lots of good years left in him, and so he is the new executive manager the next slide
[2274.24 → 2282.32] that's our new place our new digs it's a miracle every time I stand there I go this is a miracle because you
[2282.32 → 2289.40] know how much that baby cost 5.2 million dollars yeah and God we prayed we put out a fleece we said
[2289.40 → 2295.38] Lord if you want us to have our own place, and we saw this place, and we felt drawn towards it and we
[2295.38 → 2300.90] said if you can get someone to give us a mortgage and praise God someone actually gave us a
[2300.90 → 2305.98] mortgage, and we were shocked of course that's how God does it doesn't he always shocks us when he
[2305.98 → 2311.38] it does amazing things so that is our so we're in the corner of 203 Street and Logan Avenue and
[2311.90 → 2313.66] another slide
[2313.66 → 2314.86] That's the side view
[2314.86 → 2320.48] That's where you go to drop off all your stuff you want to bring as well as that's where trucks come that type of thing
[2320.48 → 2322.80] So that's always the that's the load-off area
[2323.38 → 2327.78] So just so you know Monday Wednesday Friday and then Wednesday nights we are open
[2328.16 → 2331.96] In June we had 32 brand-new family units that came
[2331.96 → 2337.26] We served our average was 181 visits on those days that were open and
[2337.88 → 2339.88] June alone we served
[2340.88 → 2342.88] 5,432 people
[2343.52 → 2345.34] For July
[2345.34 → 2350.94] 43 another 43 brand-new family units came on top of the 32 in June and
[2351.56 → 2356.40] I don't have the stats for the rest of one of the ladies who does that she's on vacation next slide
[2356.40 → 2363.76] So this is our new inside area 13,000 square feet praise God let me hear it praise the Lord
[2363.76 → 2368.92] Yeah, we do have we have 15 in the building, but the city won't let us use about 2,000
[2368.92 → 2372.74] And so this is the area we put in the fridges the walk-in fridges and walk-in freezer
[2372.74 → 2377.52] And this is where all our vegetables are sorted. So that's one of the areas next slide
[2378.16 → 2380.84] This is our shopping area. So we have an area
[2381.64 → 2384.88] When clients come in they can't actually they're just so many of them
[2385.16 → 2390.64] We just don't have the time so we all their dry stuff we put in bins and we
[2390.88 → 2394.88] Apportion out how much for a family of three or how much for a family of four to nine
[2394.88 → 2397.96] So we give them that bin and here's where they shop for that
[2397.96 → 2401.58] So they've tried to put in stuff. Okay next one the next one. This is the sorting area
[2401.58 → 2406.34] This is where people we bring our all the stuff they come in, and we have to look to it
[2406.34 → 2409.52] We look at dent cans, and we looked at the conditions of things
[2409.88 → 2413.34] Do you know that people are still bringing in ancient food?
[2414.06 → 2420.14] On the day that we had our open house a lady brought in a perfectly wrapped six tins of tuna
[2420.14 → 2426.62] And I thought bonus, and she was such a nice lady. I didn't look at the date was 2014
[2426.62 → 2434.92] It was still wrapped in the end is this I unbelievable but people what people bring in is crazy
[2435.08 → 2436.08] All right next one
[2436.08 → 2444.24] This is the whole reason we're there Jesus in the middle showing how he provided in biblical times and how he provides today
[2444.42 → 2449.06] We want our clients not only to be fed physically but fed spiritually
[2449.06 → 2452.16] So we want them to get to know Jesus
[2452.16 → 2457.78] Let me close with the story
[2457.78 → 2462.32] My heart is for the lost as I'm sure yours is
[2462.32 → 2466.66] And there's one ex-pastor who on Wednesdays comes, and he talks to people
[2466.66 → 2472.06] And over the last year he has gotten a group of four to six of our clients
[2472.06 → 2474.64] Who actually attend church with him?
[2474.64 → 2482.94] And in the middle of the church right around dell ex-pastor dell there's four to six of our clients
[2482.94 → 2488.76] Who sit next to him, and they ask him questions, and they enjoy the worship, and they hear the gospel
[2488.76 → 2495.22] That is my heart's desire, and it's always been is that we can bring our clients to churches like you guys
[2495.22 → 2501.60] They would come with you sit with you hear the gospel, and they would receive Jesus Christ as their personal saviour
[2501.60 → 2503.98] So thank you for giving us the means
[2503.98 → 2509.52] To get them to come to us so that we can give them the real fruit the real bread of life
[2509.52 → 2510.72] Jesus Christ
[2510.72 → 2523.08] So thanks Jim for coming
[2523.08 → 2526.94] We'll just take a minute to pray for Jim before we host um the offering today
[2526.94 → 2530.64] And I should say the offering today is for something else. Yeah, we'll introduce that in a minute
[2530.64 → 2536.24] But we of course have the food bank on the offering schedule in the fall usually around Thanksgiving again
[2536.24 → 2538.54] Yeah, so let's pray for Jim in the food bank a minute

[2915.74 → 2916.74] Tricky question.

[2926.74 → 2931.74] And we are going to enjoy some time in children's worship time, talking about a couple of special highlights there, too.
[2931.74 → 2937.74] And then, in a couple of weeks, we'll get back to the regular children's worship time schedule.

[2955.74 → 2957.74] And also with you.
[2961.74 → 2963.74] Thank you.
[2963.74 → 2968.74] Hi.
[2968.74 → 2985.74] My name is Paul, and I am an elder here at this church.
[2985.74 → 2990.12] ask you to join me in a prayer for our church family.
[2997.46 → 2998.56] Father in heaven,
[2999.80 → 3001.58] holy are you, God.
[3003.58 → 3006.44] Who else commands all the hosts of heaven?
[3007.82 → 3010.78] Who else could make every knee bow down?
[3012.00 → 3015.58] Who else can whisper and the darkness trembles?
[3016.70 → 3019.44] Only you, God, our holy God.
[3021.06 → 3025.04] What other beauty demands such praises?
[3026.52 → 3028.96] What other splendour outshines the sun?
[3030.36 → 3033.84] What other majesty rules with justice?
[3034.92 → 3037.52] Only you, God, our holy God.
[3039.44 → 3042.08] What other glory consumes like fire?
[3043.14 → 3045.68] What other power can raise the dead?
[3046.74 → 3049.92] What other name remains undefeated?
[3049.92 → 3054.46] Only you, God, our holy God.
[3054.46 → 3059.66] Who else could rescue us from our failings?
[3061.00 → 3064.14] Who else would offer his only son?
[3065.98 → 3069.10] Who else invites us to call him Father?
[3069.10 → 3072.72] Father, only a holy God.
[3073.72 → 3076.02] Only our holy God.
[3078.78 → 3083.62] Father, we give you thanks for bringing us together as this community we call Emmanuel,
[3085.00 → 3085.92] God with us.
[3085.92 → 3091.16] We pray that you will bless us in our worship and bless our fellowship.
[3092.46 → 3094.76] We give you thanks for this place to meet.
[3094.76 → 3104.68] We thank you, God, for Christ's church as we know it and see it throughout the world and pray for your blessing on it.
[3104.68 → 3109.72] Father, we pray for those who are persecuted for your name, Father.
[3109.72 → 3114.46] Father, your son prayed that we might be one.
[3114.46 → 3115.46] Father, we pray for those who are persecuted for our church.
[3115.46 → 3116.46] Father, we pray for those who are persecuted for our church.
[3116.46 → 3124.06] And we pray that he, by your spirit, would be about the work of bringing that true for our church, for your church.
[3124.06 → 3132.00] We ask that your spirit will fill our hearts so that we pray.
[3133.54 → 3140.68] Help us in our prayers to be thankful in all circumstances, wherever we are, whatever is happening in our lives.
[3142.06 → 3151.58] Help us be aware that prayer is the most important part of our thankfulness and response to the gift of grace and the redemption in our lives.
[3154.06 → 3156.68] With this in mind, Lord, we come to you.
[3158.76 → 3168.10] We thank you, along with Judy Dijkstra, that her friend Vera has recovered from shingles and is back at the Bible study that they hold together.
[3168.66 → 3170.48] We thank you for healing Vera.
[3172.48 → 3177.94] We're thankful, along with Adam and Rachel Smith, for their precious baby boy, Lucas Lars.
[3177.94 → 3182.16] We thank you for the safe arrival of this little boy.
[3182.30 → 3186.70] And we pray that you will continue to walk beside Adam and Rachel as they raise Lucas.
[3189.04 → 3192.40] We pray, Lord, that you will be with Emo and Benita Smith.
[3193.96 → 3196.70] Emo's surgery was postponed again to September 9.
[3197.58 → 3202.52] We pray that you will fill them with peace and patience and strength during this time.
[3202.52 → 3206.96] Lord, we also pray for the greater world.
[3207.24 → 3209.92] We pray that our leaders may do your will.
[3211.60 → 3214.82] We pray for the ongoing war and unrest in the Middle East.
[3215.52 → 3221.30] We know that your hand is over all these things and trust that your will be done.
[3221.30 → 3227.76] As summer break time is almost over, we pray that you will be with the students,
[3228.64 → 3236.60] especially those who are in the middle of travelling to faraway places to go to college and university.
[3236.82 → 3240.96] Lord, we ask that you will give them safe travels.
[3242.10 → 3247.12] Pray for the school leadership, teachers, and parents as they look forward to a new year.
[3247.12 → 3256.10] Lord, we ask that you will continue to work through those who help at the food bank.
[3256.26 → 3259.02] Lord, we ask that you will bless this ministry.
[3260.68 → 3263.82] We pray that you will continue to walk beside our pastors.
[3264.84 → 3267.28] Give them the wisdom and the spirit to lead us.
[3268.94 → 3272.76] We pray now that you will bless the word we are about to hear.
[3272.76 → 3277.84] Father, we pray that you will pour out your spirit on Pastor Chris as he preaches that word.
[3279.94 → 3283.84] Father, we pray that our eyes will be continually fixed on Jesus
[3283.84 → 3288.18] and that in everything we do, we will say,
[3289.18 → 3290.46] But I see Jesus.
[3292.52 → 3297.74] We pray that by your spirit, we will bring into our hearts to believe and trust in you alone.
[3298.84 → 3301.76] By your name alone, we ask for all these things.
[3301.76 → 3303.00] Amen.
[3319.00 → 3329.34] We are going to continue in our looking at stories from the early church through the book of Acts.
[3329.34 → 3334.60] We are going to read together from Acts 18 this morning.
[3334.94 → 3335.68] Acts 18.
[3335.78 → 3342.60] I am going to read verses 18 to 28 as part of our looking this morning.
[3342.76 → 3346.72] If you have a Bible with you, I encourage you to open that up and to keep that open.
[3347.20 → 3349.58] If you don't, and would like one, you can get one from the back.
[3349.80 → 3353.84] There are a couple available there for your use as well.
[3353.84 → 3361.26] As always, through the summer, if you're a kid with us here, we have some clipboards available
[3361.26 → 3367.42] and one of those pages is an opportunity to draw a picture based on what you hear in this message
[3367.42 → 3371.38] or based on something else if I'm not captivating enough for you.
[3371.58 → 3377.68] And we are collecting those, and we'll make a bit of an art display at the end of the summer together with that.
[3377.68 → 3381.48] So let's read God's word together.
[3382.86 → 3384.86] Start at verse 18.
[3384.86 → 3389.98] Paul stayed on in Corinth for some time.
[3390.58 → 3396.68] Then he left the brothers and sisters and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila.
[3397.38 → 3403.00] Before he sailed, he had his hair cut off at Cambria because of a vow he had taken.
[3403.74 → 3406.94] They arrived at Ephesus where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila.
[3407.52 → 3410.90] He himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.
[3410.90 → 3414.68] When they asked him to spend more time with them, he declined.
[3415.40 → 3419.42] But as he left, he promised, I will come back if it is God's will.
[3420.06 → 3421.78] Then he set sail from Ephesus.
[3422.42 → 3428.82] While he landed at Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church and then went down to Antioch.
[3429.28 → 3434.42] After spending some time in Antioch, Paul set out from there and travelled from place to place
[3434.42 → 3439.26] throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.
[3439.26 → 3443.58] Meanwhile, so that means back in Ephesus,
[3444.22 → 3449.82] meanwhile, a Jew named Apollos and a native of Alexandria came to Ephesus.
[3450.64 → 3453.92] He was a learned man with a thorough knowledge of the scriptures.
[3454.70 → 3456.94] He had been instructed in the way of the Lord,
[3457.12 → 3461.04] and he spoke with great fervour and taught about Jesus accurately,
[3461.38 → 3464.10] though he knew only the baptism of John.
[3464.10 → 3467.28] He began to speak boldly in the synagogue.
[3468.18 → 3469.92] When Priscilla and Aquila heard him,
[3470.38 → 3475.10] they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of God more adequately.
[3476.08 → 3478.66] When Apollos wanted to go to Achaea,
[3479.06 → 3483.42] the brothers and sisters encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him.
[3484.22 → 3488.42] When he arrived, he was a great help to those who by grace had believed,
[3488.42 → 3493.04] for he vigorously refuted his Jewish opponents in public debate,
[3493.50 → 3496.68] proving from the scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah.
[3497.38 → 3498.84] This is the word of the Lord.
[3504.46 → 3506.86] Now, I suspect I'm not alone in this,
[3506.98 → 3508.64] but when I was young,
[3508.64 → 3515.00] one of my favourite indoor pastimes was Lego.
[3516.18 → 3521.02] I used to love getting Lego and then following the instructions.
[3521.44 → 3522.64] We would do that one time,
[3522.68 → 3524.86] and then we would destroy it and lose the instructions,
[3525.28 → 3529.34] and then we would play with these massive rubber maid totes of Lego
[3529.34 → 3532.44] that we had accumulated over the years for hours on end.
[3532.44 → 3536.32] We would just tip them out on the floor and then just go at it.
[3536.32 → 3541.16] I used to love to make all the pieces fit nicely together.
[3541.32 → 3543.96] And in fact, I think I developed a pretty good skill
[3543.96 → 3546.36] that continued and stayed with me,
[3546.40 → 3549.30] such that when my son started to get into Lego,
[3550.04 → 3552.64] that was one of my best moments as a parent.
[3553.38 → 3556.32] Because I would sit down, and I would get to play Lego with Malachi,
[3556.56 → 3560.50] and honestly, one of the hardest things about being a parent of a nine-year-old boy
[3560.50 → 3561.96] is when he looks at you and says,
[3562.04 → 3563.68] Dad, I don't need your help with Lego anymore.
[3563.68 → 3566.68] And he can do it himself.
[3567.68 → 3569.12] And he builds his own thing.
[3569.22 → 3572.10] But he too then sees the parts fit together
[3572.10 → 3575.18] and how it comes to make up the whole.
[3576.32 → 3579.28] When I was young, I thought I was so good at that,
[3579.36 → 3581.26] I actually took a radio apart
[3581.26 → 3583.78] and thought I could put it back together,
[3584.50 → 3588.32] realizing I couldn't tell the transistor from a battery lead.
[3588.32 → 3590.68] And so, no, I couldn't put it back together,
[3590.82 → 3592.46] and that radio ended up in the garbage can.
[3593.06 → 3594.36] And I don't think anyone noticed,
[3594.64 → 3597.66] at least not until I've now confessed it in front of my parents.
[3600.60 → 3603.94] But it is a beautiful thing to me
[3603.94 → 3607.22] to see how the little parts and pieces
[3607.22 → 3608.90] can come together
[3608.90 → 3612.98] to make a beautiful whole,
[3613.48 → 3615.24] to make a picture
[3615.24 → 3618.92] that is greater than the sum of its parts, right?
[3618.92 → 3620.50] When you see one little brick
[3620.50 → 3624.82] and imagine its place in the Robin Hood castled forest
[3624.82 → 3628.06] is really compelling to me.
[3628.06 → 3632.54] I think, by way of analogy,
[3633.32 → 3635.70] that's a really helpful model
[3635.70 → 3637.24] or understanding for us
[3637.24 → 3640.86] of what it means to be church, right?
[3640.94 → 3642.78] Individual pieces and parts
[3642.78 → 3644.40] that come together
[3644.40 → 3647.04] to make this beautiful whole,
[3647.58 → 3648.60] that come together
[3648.60 → 3652.10] doing their part in their place,
[3652.10 → 3654.44] and then the sum of that
[3654.44 → 3656.78] is majestic.
[3656.78 → 3660.16] I think is really compelling.
[3661.50 → 3662.54] Now, these stories
[3662.54 → 3663.20] that we've been reading
[3663.20 → 3664.34] in the book of Acts
[3664.34 → 3666.42] paint for us
[3666.42 → 3667.64] sort of picture
[3667.64 → 3670.40] of what an active church community
[3670.40 → 3672.04] can be like together
[3672.04 → 3674.34] and what it does for one another.
[3675.84 → 3677.08] Now, to be clear,
[3677.84 → 3680.08] what we get in this text that we read
[3680.08 → 3681.14] and throughout the book of Acts,
[3681.14 → 3681.72] mostly,
[3682.20 → 3684.16] are descriptive events
[3684.16 → 3686.14] that become healthy examples
[3686.14 → 3687.56] examples for us
[3687.56 → 3690.54] of what churches do.
[3691.90 → 3692.50] And so what I hope
[3692.50 → 3694.04] that we can see this morning
[3694.04 → 3695.34] and looking particularly
[3695.34 → 3697.88] here in the book of Acts
[3697.88 → 3700.24] in this story of Priscilla
[3700.24 → 3701.84] and Aquila and Apollos
[3701.84 → 3705.48] is how a healthy,
[3706.20 → 3707.48] functioning church
[3707.48 → 3710.18] embraces and utilizes
[3710.18 → 3711.46] spiritual gifts
[3711.46 → 3712.92] for the building up
[3712.92 → 3713.40] of the body.
[3714.22 → 3715.50] Or to put it another way,
[3715.82 → 3716.92] how the little pieces
[3716.92 → 3718.74] all fit together
[3718.74 → 3720.58] to make a beautiful thing.
[3722.82 → 3725.34] So Priscilla and Aquila
[3725.34 → 3727.38] are companions of Paul
[3727.38 → 3729.54] and they serve the church
[3729.54 → 3731.58] by taking in Apollos
[3731.58 → 3732.72] and they teach him
[3732.72 → 3735.34] more of what he had already learned
[3735.34 → 3736.78] about Jesus and the gospel.
[3736.78 → 3737.54] And then,
[3737.92 → 3738.74] with Paul,
[3738.86 → 3739.92] they send him out
[3739.92 → 3740.64] as a teacher
[3740.64 → 3741.92] and an encourager
[3741.92 → 3743.06] in their community.
[3743.94 → 3744.08] Right?
[3744.12 → 3744.64] In summary,
[3745.06 → 3746.48] they use their gifts
[3746.48 → 3747.98] in order to facilitate
[3747.98 → 3748.90] Apollos
[3748.90 → 3750.10] using his gifts
[3750.10 → 3751.46] in order to facilitate
[3751.46 → 3752.42] the building up
[3752.42 → 3753.36] of the body.
[3753.36 → 3756.30] Now,
[3756.78 → 3758.16] before we look
[3758.16 → 3760.10] into Priscilla
[3760.10 → 3760.80] and Aquila
[3760.80 → 3761.80] and Apollos
[3761.80 → 3762.70] as an example,
[3763.62 → 3764.90] just a little bit more
[3764.90 → 3766.16] on who they are
[3766.16 → 3767.48] and how they fit
[3767.48 → 3768.66] into this story.
[3770.32 → 3770.68] You see,
[3770.74 → 3772.14] sometime around
[3772.14 → 3774.80] AD 50 or 51,
[3775.72 → 3777.02] Emperor Claudius
[3777.02 → 3777.80] in Rome
[3777.80 → 3779.20] issued a decree
[3779.20 → 3781.20] expelling all the Jews
[3781.20 → 3782.52] from the city of Rome.
[3783.36 → 3783.92] Priscilla
[3783.92 → 3785.10] and Aquila
[3785.10 → 3786.18] left Italy
[3786.18 → 3787.10] at that time
[3787.10 → 3788.64] and they moved
[3788.64 → 3789.40] to Corinth
[3789.40 → 3791.36] which is in central Greece
[3791.36 → 3792.40] sort of near Athens.
[3793.72 → 3794.04] Corinth
[3794.04 → 3795.36] is where they met Paul.
[3796.22 → 3796.34] Now,
[3796.38 → 3796.92] what we learn
[3796.92 → 3797.58] is that Priscilla
[3797.58 → 3798.18] and Aquila
[3798.18 → 3799.38] are tentmakers
[3799.38 → 3800.90] just like Paul
[3800.90 → 3801.90] and because of
[3801.90 → 3803.00] their shared profession,
[3803.48 → 3804.02] because of their
[3804.02 → 3804.74] shared commitment
[3804.74 → 3805.42] to the scriptures
[3805.42 → 3806.62] and their love for Jesus,
[3807.12 → 3807.76] the three
[3807.76 → 3809.00] stay together
[3809.00 → 3810.16] and work together
[3810.16 → 3811.24] and minister together
[3811.24 → 3812.44] for a year and a half
[3812.44 → 3813.18] in Corinth.
[3813.36 → 3815.16] Now,
[3815.22 → 3816.32] after that year and a half,
[3816.80 → 3817.88] Priscilla and Aquila
[3817.88 → 3818.64] and Paul
[3818.64 → 3820.24] sail for Syria
[3820.24 → 3821.66] for further
[3821.66 → 3822.92] mission work together.
[3823.44 → 3824.04] Just a note,
[3824.60 → 3826.84] our text says
[3826.84 → 3827.64] there
[3827.64 → 3830.54] in verse 18
[3830.54 → 3832.46] that before he sailed,
[3832.72 → 3833.44] that's Paul,
[3833.64 → 3835.14] he had his hair cut off
[3835.14 → 3835.82] at Cambria
[3835.82 → 3837.10] because of a vow
[3837.10 → 3837.90] that he had taken.
[3837.90 → 3839.50] Now,
[3840.22 → 3841.64] this is probably
[3841.64 → 3842.42] a reference
[3842.42 → 3844.74] to a Nazarite vow
[3844.74 → 3846.16] that's described
[3846.16 → 3847.14] in the Old Testament
[3847.14 → 3848.06] in Numbers 6
[3848.06 → 3849.52] through 1 through 20.
[3850.18 → 3851.54] A Nazarite vow
[3851.54 → 3852.58] was a special
[3852.58 → 3854.46] vow of consecration,
[3854.58 → 3855.40] a special oath
[3855.40 → 3856.80] of consecration
[3856.80 → 3857.96] to God
[3857.96 → 3858.68] that involved
[3858.68 → 3860.14] several specific
[3860.14 → 3861.20] commitments.
[3861.20 → 3862.66] One of them
[3862.66 → 3863.52] was to abstain
[3863.52 → 3864.22] from wine
[3864.22 → 3864.96] or other
[3864.96 → 3865.88] fermented drinks.
[3866.68 → 3867.32] A Nazarite
[3867.32 → 3868.74] was to avoid
[3868.74 → 3869.86] all things
[3869.86 → 3871.32] derived from grapes,
[3871.54 → 3872.88] including wine,
[3872.98 → 3873.78] but also vinegar
[3873.78 → 3875.30] or even fresh grapes
[3875.30 → 3876.04] and raisins.
[3876.04 → 3878.24] a Nazarite
[3878.24 → 3878.70] was also
[3878.70 → 3879.44] to avoid
[3879.44 → 3880.08] contact
[3880.08 → 3880.82] with the dead
[3880.82 → 3882.68] and they
[3882.68 → 3883.52] made a commitment
[3883.52 → 3884.62] to not
[3884.62 → 3885.66] cut their hair.
[3886.30 → 3886.74] The hair
[3886.74 → 3887.82] was to grow long
[3887.82 → 3888.64] as a sign
[3888.64 → 3889.22] of the vow
[3889.22 → 3889.58] that they
[3889.58 → 3890.80] had promised
[3890.80 → 3891.30] and made
[3891.30 → 3892.04] and at the end
[3892.04 → 3893.32] of that period
[3893.32 → 3893.80] of time,
[3893.84 → 3894.52] at the conclusion
[3894.52 → 3895.14] of the vow,
[3895.26 → 3895.96] they would shave
[3895.96 → 3896.64] their head
[3896.64 → 3897.84] as part of
[3897.84 → 3898.74] their offering
[3898.74 → 3899.50] a sacrifice
[3899.50 → 3900.40] in the temple.
[3901.32 → 3901.42] Now,
[3901.46 → 3901.68] the word
[3901.68 → 3902.26] Nazarite
[3902.26 → 3903.16] comes from
[3903.16 → 3904.16] the Hebrew word
[3904.16 → 3904.92] Nazi,
[3905.04 → 3905.36] which means
[3905.36 → 3906.02] consecrated,
[3906.04 → 3906.88] or set apart
[3906.88 → 3908.06] and it's like
[3908.06 → 3908.40] we said,
[3908.46 → 3908.76] it's someone
[3908.76 → 3909.20] who has
[3909.20 → 3910.18] set themselves
[3910.18 → 3910.70] apart
[3910.70 → 3911.44] in dedication
[3911.44 → 3912.76] to God
[3912.76 → 3913.38] by these
[3913.38 → 3914.80] particular practices.
[3915.70 → 3916.52] I want to clarify
[3916.52 → 3917.94] that Nazarite
[3917.94 → 3918.98] is not the same
[3918.98 → 3919.86] as Nazareth
[3919.86 → 3921.46] or Nazarene,
[3922.00 → 3923.22] which is derived
[3923.22 → 3923.82] from a different
[3923.82 → 3925.28] Hebrew or Aramaic word,
[3925.82 → 3926.36] na tsar,
[3926.50 → 3927.10] meaning watch,
[3927.26 → 3928.02] or Nasser,
[3928.38 → 3929.18] meaning branch.
[3930.04 → 3931.22] Why do I tell you this?
[3931.74 → 3932.36] In part,
[3932.48 → 3933.24] because when I was
[3933.24 → 3933.92] in seminary,
[3934.22 → 3934.76] I had to do
[3934.76 → 3935.76] a Bible knowledge
[3935.76 → 3936.30] exam
[3936.30 → 3937.46] to graduate
[3937.46 → 3938.32] and one of the
[3938.32 → 3938.94] questions was,
[3939.04 → 3939.52] where did Paul
[3939.52 → 3940.20] get his hair cut?
[3941.20 → 3941.86] And so now you can
[3941.86 → 3942.70] pass the Bible knowledge
[3942.70 → 3943.66] exam in seminary
[3943.66 → 3944.82] or at least one
[3944.82 → 3945.58] question out of the
[3945.58 → 3946.72] 130 or so
[3946.72 → 3947.20] that were there.
[3948.50 → 3949.40] But also
[3949.40 → 3950.60] because,
[3951.50 → 3951.82] right,
[3951.88 → 3953.04] this is filling
[3953.04 → 3953.94] in for us
[3953.94 → 3954.68] a little bit
[3954.68 → 3956.02] of who Paul
[3956.02 → 3956.50] is
[3956.50 → 3957.30] and how he
[3957.30 → 3957.94] functions
[3957.94 → 3958.94] as a missionary
[3958.94 → 3959.48] because this
[3959.48 → 3960.40] comes back
[3960.40 → 3960.90] again
[3960.90 → 3961.98] in Acts 21
[3961.98 → 3963.16] where Paul
[3963.16 → 3964.18] is in Jerusalem
[3964.18 → 3964.64] now
[3964.64 → 3965.76] and he participates
[3965.76 → 3966.64] in a purification
[3966.64 → 3967.08] rite
[3967.08 → 3967.98] with others
[3967.98 → 3968.62] who have taken
[3968.62 → 3969.08] vows.
[3969.50 → 3969.96] Again,
[3970.08 → 3970.90] probably connected
[3970.90 → 3971.80] to this Nazarite
[3971.80 → 3972.14] vow.
[3974.08 → 3974.54] And so what you
[3974.54 → 3975.10] see
[3975.10 → 3976.66] is that Paul
[3976.66 → 3979.14] is still
[3979.14 → 3979.80] connected
[3979.80 → 3981.48] to this
[3981.48 → 3982.54] cultural
[3982.54 → 3983.68] practice.
[3984.22 → 3984.36] Now,
[3984.40 → 3984.60] I don't want
[3984.60 → 3985.22] to make too much
[3985.22 → 3985.52] of it
[3985.52 → 3986.30] because the text
[3986.30 → 3986.76] doesn't make
[3986.76 → 3987.66] too much of it,
[3987.66 → 3988.90] but so that
[3988.90 → 3989.34] we don't get
[3989.34 → 3990.16] stuck on a question,
[3990.28 → 3990.68] why on earth
[3990.68 → 3991.46] did he do this,
[3991.78 → 3992.34] I do think
[3992.34 → 3992.82] it's important
[3992.82 → 3993.76] for us to say
[3993.76 → 3995.52] that Paul
[3995.52 → 3997.54] as a Jewish
[3997.54 → 3998.34] man
[3998.34 → 3999.24] was never
[3999.24 → 4000.24] too far
[4000.24 → 4001.02] from the
[4001.02 → 4001.26] sort of
[4001.26 → 4002.20] social religious
[4002.20 → 4002.92] practices
[4002.92 → 4004.34] of his culture.
[4005.78 → 4006.00] Right,
[4006.06 → 4006.78] even as he
[4006.78 → 4007.28] proclaimed
[4007.28 → 4008.02] freedom
[4008.02 → 4008.50] from the
[4008.50 → 4009.16] ritualistic
[4009.16 → 4009.74] identities
[4009.74 → 4010.64] in Jesus
[4010.64 → 4011.08] Christ,
[4011.20 → 4011.84] even as he
[4011.84 → 4012.56] advocated
[4012.56 → 4013.50] not requiring
[4013.50 → 4014.46] Gentiles
[4014.46 → 4015.00] to submit
[4015.00 → 4015.44] to many
[4015.44 → 4015.78] of these
[4015.78 → 4016.42] same sorts
[4016.42 → 4017.36] of things,
[4017.36 → 4018.40] these culturally
[4018.40 → 4019.64] Jewish ideas,
[4020.06 → 4020.22] right,
[4020.32 → 4021.30] even as a
[4021.30 → 4022.06] Jewish Christian
[4022.06 → 4023.04] he still
[4023.04 → 4023.74] lived a
[4023.74 → 4023.98] Jewish
[4023.98 → 4024.46] cultural
[4024.46 → 4024.98] life.
[4026.00 → 4026.88] Even as a
[4026.88 → 4027.34] citizen of
[4027.34 → 4027.66] the kingdom
[4027.66 → 4028.08] of heaven
[4028.08 → 4028.60] first and
[4028.60 → 4029.10] foremost,
[4029.38 → 4030.34] he lived
[4030.34 → 4030.80] as a
[4030.80 → 4031.12] citizen
[4031.12 → 4031.88] in the
[4031.88 → 4032.26] world
[4032.26 → 4032.94] while on
[4032.94 → 4033.20] mission.
[4035.20 → 4035.94] And I
[4035.94 → 4036.38] think there's
[4036.38 → 4036.92] something for
[4036.92 → 4037.64] us to see
[4037.64 → 4038.88] in that.
[4040.08 → 4040.80] But how
[4040.80 → 4041.62] we understand
[4041.62 → 4043.04] the relationship
[4043.04 → 4044.26] of Christian
[4044.26 → 4044.82] mission
[4044.82 → 4045.72] and identity
[4045.72 → 4046.96] to the
[4046.96 → 4047.42] culture
[4047.42 → 4048.86] around us
[4048.86 → 4050.62] and what
[4050.62 → 4051.20] it means
[4051.20 → 4051.94] to be
[4051.94 → 4052.44] both
[4052.44 → 4053.10] Christian
[4053.10 → 4053.94] and,
[4054.18 → 4054.66] for instance,
[4055.22 → 4055.66] Canadian.
[4056.94 → 4057.64] What it
[4057.64 → 4058.36] means to be
[4058.36 → 4059.14] Christian,
[4059.30 → 4059.68] a citizen
[4059.68 → 4059.98] of the
[4059.98 → 4060.14] kingdom
[4060.14 → 4060.62] of heaven,
[4060.78 → 4061.26] and what
[4061.26 → 4061.66] it means
[4061.66 → 4062.18] to be
[4062.18 → 4062.78] a resident
[4062.78 → 4063.98] of Langley.
[4065.38 → 4066.10] And the
[4066.10 → 4066.60] kinds of
[4066.60 → 4067.10] things that
[4067.10 → 4067.50] we do
[4067.50 → 4067.86] and are
[4067.86 → 4068.26] involved
[4068.26 → 4068.60] with
[4068.60 → 4069.12] and the
[4069.12 → 4069.52] practices
[4069.52 → 4069.94] that we
[4069.94 → 4070.30] have
[4070.30 → 4070.82] as
[4070.82 → 4071.22] Christians
[4071.22 → 4071.74] who are
[4071.74 → 4072.46] on mission
[4072.46 → 4073.18] like
[4073.18 → 4073.54] Paul
[4073.54 → 4074.38] was.
[4078.60 → 4079.12] Now,
[4079.32 → 4080.94] I'm not
[4080.94 → 4081.24] going to
[4081.24 → 4081.74] spell that
[4081.74 → 4082.14] out for
[4082.14 → 4083.46] you about
[4083.46 → 4083.86] what that
[4083.86 → 4084.18] means.
[4084.46 → 4084.96] Jim actually
[4084.96 → 4085.36] gave us an
[4085.36 → 4085.88] example of
[4085.88 → 4086.26] maybe what
[4086.26 → 4086.62] part of
[4086.62 → 4086.96] that looks
[4086.96 → 4087.28] like.
[4089.24 → 4089.98] But all
[4089.98 → 4090.50] of you
[4090.50 → 4092.44] have to
[4092.44 → 4092.68] do the
[4092.68 → 4093.10] work
[4093.10 → 4094.36] of figuring
[4094.36 → 4094.92] that out.
[4095.92 → 4096.42] What does
[4096.42 → 4096.74] it means
[4096.74 → 4097.38] for me
[4097.38 → 4098.72] as a
[4098.72 → 4099.08] Christian
[4099.08 → 4099.82] on mission
[4099.82 → 4101.18] in this
[4101.18 → 4101.64] time
[4101.64 → 4102.00] and in
[4102.00 → 4102.24] this
[4102.24 → 4102.76] place
[4102.76 → 4104.14] to
[4104.14 → 4104.52] proclaim
[4104.52 → 4104.84] this
[4104.84 → 4105.30] same
[4105.30 → 4106.56] message?
[4106.90 → 4107.12] And what
[4107.12 → 4107.82] is really
[4107.82 → 4108.42] important
[4108.42 → 4110.04] and what
[4110.04 → 4110.48] is less
[4110.48 → 4110.74] so?
[4111.70 → 4112.26] What's
[4112.26 → 4112.68] really
[4112.68 → 4113.12] important
[4113.12 → 4113.40] for me
[4113.40 → 4113.68] to make
[4113.68 → 4113.96] sure I
[4113.96 → 4114.54] stand on
[4114.54 → 4114.80] firm
[4114.80 → 4115.08] ground
[4115.08 → 4115.68] and boldly
[4115.68 → 4115.98] proclaim
[4115.98 → 4117.38] and what
[4117.38 → 4117.82] is less
[4117.82 → 4119.20] so for
[4119.20 → 4119.52] me to
[4119.52 → 4119.92] allow
[4119.92 → 4120.76] to happen?
[4123.74 → 4124.30] I'll
[4124.30 → 4124.52] leave that
[4124.52 → 4124.80] with you.
[4126.48 → 4127.16] So Paul
[4127.16 → 4128.80] and Priscilla
[4128.80 → 4129.42] and Aquila
[4129.42 → 4130.12] arrive in
[4130.12 → 4130.48] Ephesus
[4130.48 → 4131.24] where they
[4131.24 → 4131.70] spend some
[4131.70 → 4132.20] time doing
[4132.20 → 4132.58] ministry
[4132.58 → 4133.00] together.
[4133.60 → 4134.02] Paul would
[4134.02 → 4134.52] go to the
[4134.52 → 4134.82] synagogue
[4134.82 → 4135.54] preaching and
[4135.54 → 4135.84] teaching.
[4136.62 → 4137.34] Early church
[4137.34 → 4138.46] tradition suggests
[4138.46 → 4139.02] that Priscilla
[4139.02 → 4139.56] and Aquila
[4139.56 → 4140.10] would host
[4140.10 → 4141.18] the church
[4141.18 → 4141.50] in their
[4141.50 → 4142.64] house as
[4142.64 → 4143.00] they went.
[4144.32 → 4144.82] Eventually
[4144.82 → 4145.74] Paul leaves
[4145.74 → 4146.36] and continues
[4146.36 → 4147.36] his missionary
[4147.36 → 4148.32] journeys leaving
[4148.32 → 4149.02] Priscilla and
[4149.02 → 4149.82] Aquila behind
[4149.82 → 4150.44] in Ephesus.
[4151.18 → 4151.44] And while
[4151.44 → 4152.08] they're there
[4152.08 → 4153.36] Apollos comes
[4153.36 → 4154.58] and we learn
[4154.58 → 4155.14] that Apollos
[4155.14 → 4155.90] is an eloquent
[4155.90 → 4156.82] and capable
[4156.82 → 4157.56] speaker.
[4158.22 → 4159.28] He is an
[4159.28 → 4159.74] excellent
[4159.74 → 4160.62] preacher and
[4160.62 → 4161.62] recognizing
[4161.62 → 4163.02] his potential
[4163.02 → 4164.16] Priscilla and
[4164.16 → 4165.16] Aquila are
[4165.16 → 4165.92] encouraged and
[4165.92 → 4166.60] they hear him
[4166.60 → 4167.30] and then they
[4167.30 → 4168.20] notice a few
[4168.20 → 4169.44] little gaps
[4169.44 → 4170.22] in his
[4170.22 → 4170.88] understanding.
[4171.02 → 4171.22] A few
[4171.22 → 4171.54] little
[4171.54 → 4173.06] incomplete
[4173.06 → 4173.96] ideas.
[4174.62 → 4174.94] And so they
[4174.94 → 4175.40] take him
[4175.40 → 4175.84] aside.
[4176.04 → 4176.64] They open
[4176.64 → 4176.94] up their
[4176.94 → 4177.60] home to
[4177.60 → 4178.38] him and
[4178.38 → 4179.12] they explain
[4179.12 → 4179.58] the way
[4179.58 → 4180.10] of God
[4180.10 → 4180.88] more accurately.
[4182.16 → 4182.86] Now Apollos
[4182.86 → 4183.56] we learn
[4183.56 → 4184.16] is introduced
[4184.16 → 4185.04] as a Jew
[4185.04 → 4185.36] from
[4185.36 → 4185.96] Alexandria
[4185.96 → 4186.48] which is
[4186.48 → 4187.08] in Egypt.
[4187.68 → 4188.08] He's
[4188.08 → 4188.58] described
[4188.58 → 4188.92] as we
[4188.92 → 4189.22] said
[4189.22 → 4190.14] as one
[4190.14 → 4190.42] who is
[4190.42 → 4190.96] thoroughly
[4190.96 → 4191.52] acquainted
[4191.52 → 4192.32] with the
[4192.32 → 4192.64] scriptures
[4192.64 → 4193.44] and instructed
[4193.44 → 4193.92] in the
[4193.92 → 4194.20] way of
[4194.20 → 4194.54] the Lord.
[4196.10 → 4196.90] But we
[4196.90 → 4197.30] learn that
[4197.30 → 4197.80] his knowledge
[4197.80 → 4198.44] is limited
[4198.44 → 4199.46] to the
[4199.46 → 4200.12] baptism of
[4200.12 → 4200.52] John
[4200.52 → 4201.38] which is
[4201.38 → 4201.78] the baptism
[4201.78 → 4202.50] of repentance
[4202.50 → 4204.18] instead of
[4204.18 → 4204.66] the baptism
[4204.66 → 4205.26] of Jesus
[4205.26 → 4205.62] or the
[4205.62 → 4206.26] baptism of
[4206.26 → 4206.60] the early
[4206.60 → 4207.08] church
[4207.08 → 4207.42] which is
[4207.42 → 4208.40] one wherein
[4208.40 → 4208.92] we talk
[4208.92 → 4209.36] about the
[4209.36 → 4210.22] Holy Spirit
[4210.22 → 4210.60] coming,
[4210.68 → 4211.02] a baptism
[4211.02 → 4211.76] of faith.
[4213.42 → 4213.72] And with
[4213.72 → 4214.28] the support
[4214.28 → 4214.90] eventually
[4214.90 → 4215.90] and encouragement
[4215.90 → 4216.48] of the
[4216.48 → 4217.00] Ephesian
[4217.00 → 4217.54] believers
[4217.54 → 4218.26] Apollos
[4218.26 → 4219.42] is sent
[4219.42 → 4220.24] to Achaea
[4220.24 → 4220.68] which is
[4220.68 → 4221.54] the region
[4221.54 → 4222.18] of Greece
[4222.18 → 4222.82] where Corinth
[4222.82 → 4223.40] is and
[4223.40 → 4223.86] specifically
[4223.86 → 4224.54] he is in
[4224.54 → 4224.90] Corinth.
[4225.78 → 4226.18] And the
[4226.18 → 4226.70] brothers and
[4226.70 → 4227.50] sisters in
[4227.50 → 4228.12] Ephesus
[4228.12 → 4229.14] write to
[4229.14 → 4229.74] the church
[4229.74 → 4230.56] in Corinth
[4230.56 → 4231.32] to welcome
[4231.32 → 4232.98] him and
[4232.98 → 4234.02] to support
[4234.02 → 4234.32] him.
[4235.06 → 4235.30] And so
[4235.30 → 4235.94] he goes
[4235.94 → 4237.16] to Corinth
[4237.16 → 4237.68] where he's
[4237.68 → 4238.26] a great
[4238.26 → 4238.74] help to
[4238.74 → 4239.18] those who
[4239.18 → 4239.52] believe,
[4239.72 → 4239.98] where he
[4239.98 → 4240.66] refutes
[4240.66 → 4241.58] people in
[4241.58 → 4241.90] public
[4241.90 → 4242.30] debate
[4242.30 → 4242.88] and proves
[4242.88 → 4243.22] from the
[4243.22 → 4243.54] scriptures
[4243.54 → 4244.24] that Jesus
[4244.24 → 4244.94] is the
[4244.94 → 4245.28] Messiah.
[4246.18 → 4246.52] If we
[4246.52 → 4246.98] zoom out
[4246.98 → 4247.28] from the
[4247.28 → 4247.56] book of
[4247.56 → 4247.96] Acts a
[4247.96 → 4248.48] little bit
[4248.48 → 4249.70] Apollos
[4249.70 → 4250.42] becomes so
[4250.42 → 4251.14] significant
[4251.14 → 4251.72] in the
[4251.72 → 4252.20] Corinthian
[4252.20 → 4252.68] church
[4252.68 → 4253.46] that when
[4253.46 → 4254.22] Paul writes
[4254.22 → 4254.84] his letters
[4254.84 → 4255.38] to them
[4255.38 → 4255.84] later,
[4256.56 → 4256.90] we have
[4256.90 → 4257.24] this in
[4257.24 → 4257.96] 1 Corinthians,
[4258.82 → 4259.82] there are
[4259.82 → 4260.52] divisions
[4260.52 → 4261.38] taking place
[4261.38 → 4261.94] because the
[4261.94 → 4262.72] believers are
[4262.72 → 4263.48] saying things
[4263.48 → 4263.78] like,
[4263.90 → 4264.12] well I
[4264.12 → 4264.98] follow Paul,
[4265.18 → 4265.94] I follow
[4265.94 → 4266.60] Apollos,
[4266.72 → 4267.36] another says
[4267.36 → 4267.94] I follow
[4267.94 → 4268.48] Cafes,
[4268.60 → 4268.86] which is
[4268.86 → 4269.14] Peter,
[4269.40 → 4269.84] and still
[4269.84 → 4270.20] others,
[4270.20 → 4270.72] I follow
[4270.72 → 4271.02] Christ.
[4271.10 → 4271.38] So there's
[4271.38 → 4272.20] these groups
[4272.20 → 4272.60] that have
[4272.60 → 4273.62] developed around
[4273.62 → 4274.36] these people
[4274.36 → 4275.50] of influence
[4275.50 → 4276.72] and import.
[4277.68 → 4278.24] Paul says
[4278.24 → 4278.68] to them,
[4278.82 → 4279.84] hey, me
[4279.84 → 4280.82] and Apollos,
[4281.02 → 4282.16] we're servants
[4282.16 → 4283.56] of Christ
[4283.56 → 4284.94] through whom
[4284.94 → 4285.54] the Corinthians,
[4286.10 → 4286.30] you,
[4286.48 → 4287.20] have come to
[4287.20 → 4287.54] believe.
[4288.24 → 4289.14] He emphasizes
[4289.14 → 4290.26] in fact that
[4290.26 → 4292.70] Paul has
[4292.70 → 4293.42] planted the
[4293.42 → 4293.90] seed and
[4293.90 → 4295.04] Apollos watered
[4295.04 → 4295.40] the seed,
[4295.52 → 4296.24] but it was God
[4296.24 → 4296.74] who made it
[4296.74 → 4296.96] grow.
[4296.96 → 4298.98] now we
[4298.98 → 4299.42] also know
[4299.42 → 4300.04] that eventually
[4300.04 → 4301.18] Apollos left
[4301.18 → 4302.18] Corinth because
[4302.18 → 4303.12] Paul mentions
[4303.12 → 4303.62] that he
[4303.62 → 4304.78] strongly urged
[4304.78 → 4305.48] Apollos to
[4305.48 → 4306.18] go back to
[4306.18 → 4307.34] Corinth at
[4307.34 → 4307.76] the end of
[4307.76 → 4308.20] that letter,
[4308.32 → 4308.82] but that
[4308.82 → 4309.30] Apollos would
[4309.30 → 4309.78] come later,
[4309.78 → 4311.02] and it also
[4311.02 → 4311.72] seems likely
[4311.72 → 4313.22] that Paul
[4313.22 → 4314.66] sent Apollos
[4314.66 → 4315.50] with one
[4315.50 → 4316.84] other to
[4316.84 → 4317.40] Jerusalem
[4317.40 → 4318.80] because it
[4318.80 → 4319.34] seems like
[4319.34 → 4320.42] Apollos delivers
[4320.42 → 4321.42] the letter
[4321.42 → 4322.12] written to
[4322.12 → 4323.16] Titus on
[4323.16 → 4323.56] his way
[4323.56 → 4324.10] while Titus
[4324.10 → 4324.34] is on
[4324.34 → 4324.64] the island
[4324.64 → 4325.04] of Crete.
[4327.36 → 4327.96] A little
[4327.96 → 4328.22] bit more
[4328.22 → 4328.58] history,
[4329.08 → 4329.40] and I'm
[4329.40 → 4329.88] building to
[4329.88 → 4330.16] something,
[4330.26 → 4330.56] so please
[4330.56 → 4330.96] bear with
[4330.96 → 4331.18] me.
[4332.94 → 4333.46] Tradition
[4333.46 → 4333.90] will go
[4333.90 → 4334.30] on to
[4334.30 → 4335.98] say that
[4335.98 → 4336.48] Apollos
[4336.48 → 4337.06] became a
[4337.06 → 4337.34] bishop,
[4337.74 → 4338.42] possibly in
[4338.42 → 4338.78] Corinth,
[4339.00 → 4339.62] some say
[4339.62 → 4340.36] in Caesarea
[4340.36 → 4341.12] or Smyrna.
[4341.94 → 4343.04] A long-standing
[4343.04 → 4343.92] tradition in
[4343.92 → 4344.28] the early
[4344.28 → 4344.56] church,
[4344.66 → 4345.04] especially in
[4345.04 → 4345.38] the eastern
[4345.38 → 4345.90] part of the
[4345.90 → 4346.18] church,
[4346.24 → 4346.62] is that
[4346.62 → 4347.24] Apollos
[4347.24 → 4347.78] may have
[4347.78 → 4348.12] been the
[4348.12 → 4348.54] author of
[4348.54 → 4349.18] the letter
[4349.18 → 4349.52] to the
[4349.52 → 4349.94] Hebrews,
[4350.38 → 4350.74] although we're
[4350.74 → 4351.26] not sure
[4351.26 → 4351.80] of that.
[4351.80 → 4353.92] some
[4353.92 → 4354.56] traditions
[4354.56 → 4355.18] go on to
[4355.18 → 4355.54] say that
[4355.54 → 4356.14] he practiced
[4356.14 → 4357.24] ministry in
[4357.24 → 4357.82] Alexandria,
[4358.10 → 4358.32] in his
[4358.32 → 4358.60] hometown,
[4358.88 → 4359.22] and became
[4359.22 → 4360.08] really influential
[4360.08 → 4360.90] throughout
[4360.90 → 4361.84] North Africa.
[4363.28 → 4364.02] Now the
[4364.02 → 4364.46] reason I
[4364.46 → 4365.02] belabour this
[4365.02 → 4366.52] point is
[4366.52 → 4366.94] because I
[4366.94 → 4368.20] think what
[4368.20 → 4368.58] we are
[4368.58 → 4369.78] seeing is
[4369.78 → 4370.34] a very
[4370.34 → 4371.32] particular
[4371.32 → 4374.66] example of
[4374.66 → 4375.62] a healthy
[4375.62 → 4376.94] functioning
[4376.94 → 4377.88] church
[4377.88 → 4378.96] embracing
[4378.96 → 4380.06] and utilizing
[4380.06 → 4381.12] spiritual
[4381.12 → 4381.62] gifts,
[4381.80 → 4382.40] for the
[4382.40 → 4382.78] building up
[4382.78 → 4382.94] of the
[4382.94 → 4383.24] body.
[4383.84 → 4384.32] I think
[4384.32 → 4384.80] this is a
[4384.80 → 4385.64] picture that
[4385.64 → 4386.70] shows us
[4386.70 → 4388.16] one way
[4388.16 → 4388.94] that
[4388.94 → 4390.36] can look.
[4391.64 → 4392.14] And notice
[4392.14 → 4392.72] in verse
[4392.72 → 4393.22] 16,
[4394.02 → 4394.68] when Priscilla
[4394.68 → 4395.22] and Aquila
[4395.22 → 4396.38] heard him,
[4396.80 → 4397.46] they invited
[4397.46 → 4398.12] him into
[4398.12 → 4398.84] their home
[4398.84 → 4400.06] and explained
[4400.06 → 4400.78] to him
[4400.78 → 4401.58] the way
[4401.58 → 4402.16] of God
[4402.16 → 4402.64] more
[4402.64 → 4403.40] adequately.
[4405.44 → 4405.78] And so
[4405.78 → 4406.16] out of
[4406.16 → 4407.60] this story,
[4407.78 → 4408.34] this descriptive
[4408.34 → 4408.82] event,
[4408.94 → 4409.52] I want to
[4409.52 → 4410.42] draw out
[4410.42 → 4411.24] some principles
[4411.24 → 4411.84] for our
[4411.84 → 4412.54] consideration.
[4412.96 → 4413.30] But the
[4413.30 → 4413.76] reason I
[4413.76 → 4414.30] wanted to
[4414.30 → 4415.32] outline the
[4415.32 → 4415.90] history of
[4415.90 → 4416.14] it and
[4416.14 → 4416.42] what we
[4416.42 → 4417.06] see is
[4417.06 → 4418.62] because this
[4418.62 → 4419.62] is how
[4419.62 → 4421.24] God ordinarily
[4421.24 → 4423.08] functions in
[4423.08 → 4423.64] and through
[4423.64 → 4424.32] his church.
[4424.78 → 4425.76] This is how
[4425.76 → 4426.84] God grows
[4426.84 → 4427.56] the body
[4427.56 → 4428.82] of believers.
[4429.26 → 4429.96] This is how
[4429.96 → 4431.14] God has the
[4431.14 → 4432.02] gospel message
[4432.02 → 4432.62] go forth
[4432.62 → 4433.36] into all the
[4433.36 → 4433.66] world.
[4433.66 → 4433.68] world.
[4435.06 → 4435.42] And so
[4435.42 → 4435.82] when we
[4435.82 → 4436.78] talk this
[4436.78 → 4437.40] morning about
[4437.40 → 4438.78] our lives
[4438.78 → 4439.60] here at
[4439.60 → 4440.42] Langley-Emmanuel
[4440.42 → 4441.94] in Durbanville
[4441.94 → 4442.90] in Langley
[4442.90 → 4444.16] in Canada,
[4444.62 → 4446.20] we're talking
[4446.20 → 4446.88] about things
[4446.88 → 4447.40] that God
[4447.40 → 4448.86] uses to
[4448.86 → 4450.04] transform and
[4450.04 → 4450.80] change the
[4450.80 → 4452.30] entire world.
[4453.82 → 4454.24] So don't
[4454.24 → 4454.94] miss that.
[4455.00 → 4455.64] Even as you
[4455.64 → 4455.98] think,
[4456.46 → 4457.04] what can I
[4457.04 → 4457.40] do?
[4458.40 → 4459.00] Remember,
[4459.54 → 4460.20] our God
[4460.20 → 4461.86] uses you
[4461.86 → 4462.32] and me
[4462.32 → 4463.76] to change
[4463.76 → 4464.92] the world.
[4467.18 → 4467.84] And so
[4467.84 → 4468.42] as we look
[4468.42 → 4468.72] at this
[4468.72 → 4469.30] story and
[4469.30 → 4469.74] we look to
[4469.74 → 4470.38] an example,
[4471.20 → 4471.98] ask yourselves,
[4472.48 → 4474.14] what does
[4474.14 → 4474.42] this mean
[4474.42 → 4474.80] for me?
[4476.28 → 4476.90] What do I
[4476.90 → 4477.76] need to
[4477.76 → 4479.12] hear God
[4479.12 → 4479.86] say to
[4479.86 → 4480.98] me this
[4480.98 → 4481.24] morning?
[4483.22 → 4483.78] So
[4483.78 → 4484.22] Priscilla
[4484.22 → 4484.84] and Aquila
[4484.84 → 4485.64] listened,
[4486.34 → 4487.12] they invited
[4487.12 → 4487.52] him into
[4487.52 → 4488.14] their lives,
[4488.44 → 4488.94] and they
[4488.94 → 4489.48] taught him,
[4490.04 → 4490.44] and then
[4490.44 → 4490.88] they sent
[4490.88 → 4491.96] him out.
[4492.62 → 4492.80] And so
[4492.80 → 4493.04] for the
[4493.04 → 4493.28] rest of
[4493.28 → 4493.58] our time,
[4493.62 → 4493.78] I want
[4493.78 → 4494.64] to do
[4494.64 → 4495.42] those five
[4495.42 → 4496.78] steps with
[4496.78 → 4496.98] you.
[4498.14 → 4498.68] First of
[4498.68 → 4498.78] all,
[4498.82 → 4499.06] notice,
[4499.18 → 4499.42] Priscilla
[4499.42 → 4499.88] and Aquila
[4499.88 → 4501.58] had space
[4501.58 → 4502.16] in their
[4502.16 → 4502.56] lives.
[4504.56 → 4505.00] They
[4505.00 → 4505.66] made room
[4505.66 → 4506.94] to invite
[4506.94 → 4507.50] in a
[4507.50 → 4508.02] stranger,
[4509.18 → 4509.68] a brother
[4509.68 → 4509.94] in the
[4509.94 → 4510.20] Lord,
[4510.30 → 4510.60] yes and
[4510.60 → 4510.90] amen,
[4511.94 → 4512.24] but one
[4512.24 → 4512.52] that they
[4512.52 → 4512.88] did not
[4512.88 → 4513.10] know.
[4515.04 → 4515.78] How many
[4515.78 → 4516.60] of us
[4516.60 → 4518.58] have space
[4518.58 → 4519.02] in our
[4519.02 → 4519.42] lives?
[4520.88 → 4521.34] And I'm
[4521.34 → 4521.62] not even
[4521.62 → 4521.86] going to
[4521.86 → 4522.32] say to
[4522.32 → 4522.80] invite in
[4522.80 → 4523.22] a stranger
[4523.22 → 4523.64] to live
[4523.64 → 4524.02] with you,
[4524.66 → 4525.52] but just
[4525.52 → 4526.28] space in
[4526.28 → 4526.82] your lives
[4526.82 → 4527.16] so that
[4527.16 → 4527.60] when someone
[4527.60 → 4528.04] calls you
[4528.04 → 4528.32] up and
[4528.32 → 4528.44] say,
[4528.50 → 4528.62] hey,
[4528.76 → 4529.24] can we
[4529.24 → 4529.76] get together?
[4529.86 → 4530.08] I need
[4530.08 → 4530.28] to have
[4530.28 → 4530.64] a chat,
[4530.84 → 4531.18] and you
[4531.18 → 4531.42] say,
[4531.80 → 4532.26] yeah,
[4532.28 → 4532.54] I think
[4532.54 → 4532.74] I have
[4532.74 → 4533.22] time in
[4533.22 → 4534.34] December.
[4537.62 → 4538.30] How many
[4538.30 → 4538.54] of us
[4538.54 → 4539.56] make space
[4539.56 → 4540.00] in our
[4540.00 → 4540.40] time?
[4542.42 → 4542.90] Intentionally
[4542.90 → 4545.18] build gaps
[4545.18 → 4546.46] and opportunities
[4546.46 → 4548.38] for God
[4548.38 → 4548.86] to work?
[4550.46 → 4550.96] In our
[4550.96 → 4551.70] culture of
[4551.70 → 4552.28] busyness,
[4552.40 → 4552.82] it's so
[4552.82 → 4553.36] easy to
[4553.36 → 4553.70] think we
[4553.70 → 4553.88] have to
[4553.88 → 4554.20] run from
[4554.20 → 4554.60] this thing
[4554.60 → 4554.94] to this
[4554.94 → 4555.26] thing to
[4555.26 → 4555.68] this thing,
[4555.98 → 4556.56] especially
[4556.56 → 4557.34] as parents
[4557.34 → 4557.76] of young
[4557.76 → 4558.28] kids when
[4558.28 → 4558.56] you want
[4558.56 → 4558.80] them to
[4558.80 → 4559.22] do this
[4559.22 → 4559.60] and that
[4559.60 → 4559.90] and that,
[4560.06 → 4560.48] and it's
[4560.48 → 4560.80] good,
[4560.88 → 4561.00] right?
[4561.02 → 4561.20] You want
[4561.20 → 4561.58] to set
[4561.58 → 4562.08] them up
[4562.08 → 4562.98] well in
[4562.98 → 4563.22] life,
[4563.30 → 4563.68] so you're
[4563.68 → 4564.22] going to
[4564.22 → 4564.66] drive them
[4564.66 → 4565.02] all over
[4565.02 → 4565.46] the world
[4565.46 → 4566.76] because you
[4566.76 → 4567.16] want what's
[4567.16 → 4567.60] best for
[4567.60 → 4567.86] them.
[4569.68 → 4570.18] And so
[4570.18 → 4570.50] don't hear
[4570.50 → 4570.74] what I'm
[4570.74 → 4571.22] not saying.
[4571.96 → 4572.38] This isn't
[4572.38 → 4573.06] about shame,
[4573.32 → 4573.76] this isn't
[4573.76 → 4574.34] about guilt,
[4574.76 → 4575.34] this is
[4575.34 → 4575.86] simply a
[4575.86 → 4576.32] question.
[4576.32 → 4578.66] Is there
[4578.66 → 4580.30] space in
[4580.30 → 4581.02] your life
[4581.02 → 4582.40] for God
[4582.40 → 4582.76] to do
[4582.76 → 4583.34] something
[4583.34 → 4585.56] like this?
[4586.46 → 4587.24] Is there
[4587.24 → 4587.88] space in
[4587.88 → 4588.38] your life
[4588.38 → 4589.04] for God
[4589.04 → 4589.50] to bring
[4589.50 → 4590.22] someone to
[4590.22 → 4590.68] you and
[4590.68 → 4591.02] say,
[4592.06 → 4592.64] minister to
[4592.64 → 4592.84] them?
[4595.74 → 4596.56] And how
[4596.56 → 4596.86] are you
[4596.86 → 4597.38] building
[4597.38 → 4598.46] that
[4598.46 → 4599.82] space?
[4600.88 → 4601.58] How are
[4601.58 → 4602.16] you creating
[4602.16 → 4604.00] that time
[4604.00 → 4605.46] and reality
[4605.46 → 4607.12] and if
[4607.12 → 4607.80] you cannot
[4607.80 → 4608.52] or if
[4608.52 → 4609.40] you aren't
[4609.40 → 4610.28] sure how
[4610.28 → 4610.84] you ever
[4610.84 → 4611.38] would,
[4611.84 → 4612.42] ask the
[4612.42 → 4612.96] question,
[4614.70 → 4616.08] what is
[4616.08 → 4617.00] most
[4617.00 → 4618.52] important
[4618.52 → 4620.04] here?
[4620.84 → 4621.64] What
[4621.64 → 4622.32] really
[4622.32 → 4623.54] matters
[4623.54 → 4624.50] here?
[4627.44 → 4628.42] And again,
[4628.46 → 4628.76] I don't know
[4628.76 → 4629.08] the answer
[4629.08 → 4629.38] to that
[4629.38 → 4629.88] question for
[4629.88 → 4630.04] you.
[4630.80 → 4631.48] That's your
[4631.48 → 4631.76] job.
[4631.76 → 4633.92] I'm going
[4633.92 → 4634.22] to lead
[4634.22 → 4634.54] you to
[4634.54 → 4634.76] it.
[4635.70 → 4636.28] You need
[4636.28 → 4636.66] to ask
[4636.66 → 4636.86] it.
[4637.72 → 4638.10] You need
[4638.10 → 4638.52] to wonder.
[4640.50 → 4641.02] Now notice,
[4641.32 → 4641.68] they had
[4641.68 → 4642.50] space for
[4642.50 → 4644.30] Apollos and
[4644.30 → 4644.92] then they
[4644.92 → 4645.68] invited him
[4645.68 → 4646.88] into their
[4646.88 → 4647.14] home.
[4647.50 → 4647.84] They did
[4647.84 → 4648.98] life together.
[4650.64 → 4653.70] I have
[4653.70 → 4655.04] seen the
[4655.04 → 4655.58] way this
[4655.58 → 4656.20] can work
[4656.20 → 4657.38] in people's
[4657.38 → 4658.02] lives.
[4658.82 → 4659.38] We have
[4659.38 → 4659.98] examples of
[4659.98 → 4665.70] people in
[4665.70 → 4666.44] our own
[4666.44 → 4667.46] church family
[4667.46 → 4668.50] who opened
[4668.50 → 4669.14] their homes
[4669.14 → 4670.20] up to
[4670.20 → 4670.82] strangers,
[4671.74 → 4672.18] complete and
[4672.18 → 4672.80] utter strangers,
[4673.46 → 4673.92] and they
[4673.92 → 4674.54] lived together
[4674.54 → 4675.78] for a period
[4675.78 → 4676.14] of time.
[4676.22 → 4677.02] They welcomed
[4677.02 → 4677.40] them and
[4677.40 → 4677.94] they ministered
[4677.94 → 4678.32] to them and
[4678.32 → 4678.74] they taught
[4678.74 → 4679.02] them.
[4680.82 → 4681.52] Our youth
[4681.52 → 4682.26] program here
[4682.26 → 4683.12] at Emmanuel
[4683.12 → 4683.82] is set up
[4683.82 → 4684.60] in exactly
[4684.60 → 4685.30] this way,
[4685.82 → 4686.68] of partnering
[4686.68 → 4688.18] leaders with
[4688.18 → 4688.98] youth starting
[4688.98 → 4689.56] in grade 8
[4689.56 → 4689.94] who will
[4689.94 → 4690.60] walk with
[4690.60 → 4690.98] them for
[4690.98 → 4691.32] the next
[4691.32 → 4692.02] five years.
[4694.76 → 4695.36] Intentionally
[4695.36 → 4696.38] doing life
[4696.38 → 4696.98] together,
[4697.16 → 4697.82] intentionally
[4697.82 → 4699.20] discipling and
[4699.20 → 4700.30] raising them
[4700.30 → 4700.56] up.
[4702.98 → 4703.34] And so
[4703.34 → 4703.70] for you
[4703.70 → 4704.12] youth,
[4704.82 → 4706.06] are you
[4706.06 → 4706.48] letting that
[4706.48 → 4706.76] be a
[4706.76 → 4707.26] priority?
[4708.80 → 4709.54] Because I
[4709.54 → 4709.82] know for
[4709.82 → 4710.32] the leaders
[4710.32 → 4710.80] who are
[4710.80 → 4711.08] here,
[4711.50 → 4712.06] they are.
[4714.28 → 4714.96] And for
[4714.96 → 4715.60] you parent
[4715.60 → 4716.38] of youth,
[4716.58 → 4717.02] are you
[4717.02 → 4717.50] letting that
[4717.50 → 4717.84] be a
[4717.84 → 4718.36] priority?
[4719.20 → 4719.68] Encouraging
[4719.68 → 4720.18] your kids
[4720.18 → 4720.48] in that
[4720.48 → 4720.88] direction
[4720.88 → 4721.18] and in
[4721.18 → 4721.32] that
[4721.32 → 4721.86] relationship.
[4722.98 → 4723.60] Because this
[4723.60 → 4723.94] is what it
[4723.94 → 4724.50] looks like
[4724.50 → 4724.78] for a
[4724.78 → 4725.06] healthy,
[4725.22 → 4725.52] functioning
[4725.52 → 4727.88] church to
[4727.88 → 4728.80] utilize the
[4728.80 → 4729.74] spiritual gifts
[4729.74 → 4730.54] for the
[4730.54 → 4730.94] building up
[4730.94 → 4731.12] of the
[4731.12 → 4731.44] body.
[4732.28 → 4732.96] This is
[4732.96 → 4733.96] what God
[4733.96 → 4735.04] does.
[4736.64 → 4737.16] We were
[4737.16 → 4737.70] just talking
[4737.70 → 4738.16] about care
[4738.16 → 4738.84] groups earlier
[4738.84 → 4739.74] this morning.
[4739.84 → 4740.10] This is
[4740.10 → 4740.66] another place
[4740.66 → 4741.10] where God
[4741.10 → 4742.18] does this,
[4742.26 → 4742.50] where he
[4742.50 → 4744.24] builds lives
[4744.24 → 4745.18] lived together.
[4745.32 → 4745.52] We have
[4745.52 → 4746.00] some care
[4746.00 → 4746.44] groups here
[4746.44 → 4746.74] who have
[4746.74 → 4747.10] been meeting
[4747.10 → 4747.72] for 25
[4747.72 → 4748.98] plus years.
[4749.46 → 4749.78] And that
[4749.78 → 4750.42] is amazing
[4750.42 → 4751.06] and incredible.
[4751.20 → 4751.40] We have
[4751.40 → 4751.82] some care
[4751.82 → 4752.56] groups who
[4752.56 → 4752.86] are just
[4752.86 → 4753.10] saying,
[4753.40 → 4753.62] hey, we
[4753.62 → 4753.90] want to
[4753.90 → 4754.40] start this
[4754.40 → 4754.64] year.
[4755.60 → 4755.86] We have
[4755.86 → 4756.30] some leaders
[4756.30 → 4756.56] who are
[4756.56 → 4757.00] looking for
[4757.00 → 4757.98] more people
[4757.98 → 4758.32] to be
[4758.32 → 4758.66] involved.
[4758.78 → 4759.02] And I do
[4759.02 → 4759.48] have permission
[4759.48 → 4759.78] to say
[4759.78 → 4759.96] this.
[4760.10 → 4760.54] Perry's
[4760.54 → 4761.06] group is
[4761.06 → 4761.52] looking for
[4761.52 → 4762.10] more people
[4762.10 → 4762.68] to be
[4762.68 → 4763.04] involved.
[4763.22 → 4763.52] And so if
[4763.52 → 4763.92] that seems
[4763.92 → 4764.36] like something
[4764.36 → 4764.60] you're
[4764.60 → 4765.22] interested in,
[4765.50 → 4766.14] Perry wants
[4766.14 → 4766.44] you in
[4766.44 → 4766.88] his group.
[4768.54 → 4769.08] This is a
[4769.08 → 4770.40] walking in
[4770.40 → 4771.60] life together.
[4773.14 → 4773.98] This past
[4773.98 → 4775.32] year, I
[4775.32 → 4775.60] have been
[4775.60 → 4776.94] part of a
[4776.94 → 4777.60] group of
[4777.60 → 4778.12] pastor
[4778.12 → 4779.12] theologians
[4779.12 → 4779.58] that gets
[4779.58 → 4780.40] together four
[4780.40 → 4781.14] times every
[4781.14 → 4781.56] year at
[4781.56 → 4781.94] Trinity
[4781.94 → 4782.68] Western
[4782.68 → 4784.06] University to
[4784.06 → 4784.90] wrestle and
[4784.90 → 4785.96] to do life
[4785.96 → 4786.64] together and
[4786.64 → 4787.52] to think
[4787.52 → 4788.32] critically and
[4788.32 → 4789.30] theologically about
[4789.30 → 4789.82] preaching and
[4789.82 → 4790.40] about the call
[4790.40 → 4791.50] of ministry and
[4791.50 → 4792.08] what that means.
[4792.16 → 4792.66] And that has
[4792.66 → 4794.20] done incredible
[4794.20 → 4795.44] things in my
[4795.44 → 4796.18] heart and in my
[4796.18 → 4796.84] life and in my
[4796.84 → 4797.50] relationship to
[4797.50 → 4798.54] God as these
[4798.54 → 4799.66] other pastors
[4799.66 → 4801.16] encourage and
[4801.16 → 4802.52] speak truths
[4802.52 → 4803.52] to me.
[4805.08 → 4805.94] They're creating
[4805.94 → 4807.20] space to do
[4807.20 → 4808.46] life together.
[4809.68 → 4810.08] I have a
[4810.08 → 4810.38] group of
[4810.38 → 4811.62] friends that I
[4811.62 → 4811.92] went to
[4811.92 → 4812.56] seminary with
[4812.56 → 4813.70] almost 15
[4813.70 → 4814.40] years ago,
[4814.90 → 4816.08] more than 15
[4816.08 → 4816.56] years ago,
[4816.62 → 4817.20] oh my goodness.
[4819.60 → 4820.38] And we
[4820.38 → 4822.10] still are so
[4822.10 → 4823.06] incredibly close.
[4823.16 → 4823.68] In fact, two
[4823.68 → 4824.28] of their families
[4824.28 → 4825.62] visited us last
[4825.62 → 4826.04] week and were
[4826.04 → 4826.54] here in worship
[4826.54 → 4827.74] with us last
[4827.74 → 4828.02] week.
[4828.72 → 4829.36] These people
[4829.36 → 4830.64] have lived life
[4830.64 → 4831.02] with me and
[4831.02 → 4831.56] have spoken
[4831.56 → 4832.56] life to me
[4832.56 → 4832.90] and have
[4832.90 → 4834.18] spoken challenging
[4834.18 → 4835.80] words to me.
[4837.50 → 4838.20] Because when
[4838.20 → 4838.80] you do life
[4838.80 → 4839.56] together, here's
[4839.56 → 4840.12] another principle
[4840.12 → 4841.70] for you, we
[4841.70 → 4843.08] cannot be afraid
[4843.08 → 4844.32] of disagreement.
[4845.48 → 4846.44] We cannot be
[4846.44 → 4847.44] afraid of saying
[4847.44 → 4849.74] hard things to
[4849.74 → 4850.18] each other.
[4851.66 → 4851.98] And in fact,
[4852.06 → 4852.36] the scriptures
[4852.36 → 4853.08] call us to
[4853.08 → 4854.16] always be prepared
[4854.16 → 4854.94] in season and
[4854.94 → 4855.72] out of season to
[4855.72 → 4856.78] give the reason
[4856.78 → 4857.36] for the hope
[4857.36 → 4857.94] that you have
[4857.94 → 4859.14] in Jesus Christ.
[4859.24 → 4860.02] We always have
[4860.02 → 4861.06] to be ready to
[4861.06 → 4861.42] do that.
[4861.50 → 4862.06] But scripture
[4862.06 → 4863.62] also says to
[4863.62 → 4864.04] do that with
[4864.04 → 4865.60] gentleness and
[4865.60 → 4866.14] respect.
[4868.36 → 4869.08] And so we
[4869.08 → 4870.04] need to be able
[4870.04 → 4871.02] to disagree with
[4871.02 → 4871.44] each other.
[4871.52 → 4872.04] We need to be
[4872.04 → 4872.52] able to ask
[4872.52 → 4873.46] each other hard
[4873.46 → 4873.90] questions.
[4874.02 → 4874.48] We need to be
[4874.48 → 4875.52] able to rebuke
[4875.52 → 4876.14] and hold each
[4876.14 → 4876.80] other accountable,
[4877.32 → 4878.28] but with
[4878.28 → 4879.70] gentleness and
[4879.70 → 4880.20] respect.
[4881.20 → 4881.78] Because this is
[4881.78 → 4882.32] how God grows
[4882.32 → 4882.80] the church.
[4883.54 → 4884.22] This is how God
[4884.22 → 4884.96] grows you and
[4884.96 → 4885.90] me as disciples
[4885.90 → 4887.28] in his name,
[4887.36 → 4888.40] as we are more
[4888.40 → 4889.34] and more transformed
[4889.34 → 4890.44] into the image
[4890.44 → 4891.20] of Jesus Christ.
[4891.32 → 4892.08] He does that
[4892.08 → 4893.38] through you
[4893.38 → 4894.26] to me and
[4894.26 → 4895.04] me to you
[4895.04 → 4895.68] and you to
[4895.68 → 4896.34] her and her
[4896.34 → 4897.08] to you and
[4897.08 → 4897.66] so on and
[4897.66 → 4898.50] so forth in
[4898.50 → 4900.06] these multiplicities
[4900.06 → 4901.02] of relationships.
[4902.28 → 4903.20] This is how
[4903.20 → 4904.94] God works.
[4906.82 → 4907.64] Now notice,
[4907.80 → 4908.48] they listened
[4908.48 → 4909.66] to him.
[4909.78 → 4910.82] They heard
[4910.82 → 4911.40] him.
[4913.40 → 4914.50] This may be a
[4914.50 → 4915.18] stretch, but
[4915.18 → 4915.76] remember this is a
[4915.76 → 4916.48] descriptive event,
[4916.54 → 4916.94] so we're pulling
[4916.94 → 4917.54] principles out,
[4917.60 → 4917.94] so we're allowed
[4917.94 → 4918.42] to stretch a
[4918.42 → 4918.74] little bit.
[4919.30 → 4920.04] Part of what
[4920.04 → 4920.96] this looks like
[4920.96 → 4922.26] is listening
[4922.26 → 4923.50] genuinely,
[4923.88 → 4924.58] authentically,
[4924.86 → 4926.10] meaningfully to
[4926.10 → 4926.78] people who are
[4926.78 → 4927.32] different from
[4927.32 → 4928.26] you, to people
[4928.26 → 4929.16] who are experiencing
[4929.16 → 4930.06] different things
[4930.06 → 4930.64] than you, to
[4930.64 → 4931.12] people who have
[4931.12 → 4932.24] entirely different
[4932.24 → 4933.10] walks of life
[4933.10 → 4935.88] than you, and
[4935.88 → 4936.74] listening and
[4936.74 → 4938.16] wondering how.
[4938.72 → 4940.28] How is God
[4940.28 → 4941.80] using them, or
[4941.80 → 4942.58] how is God
[4942.58 → 4943.42] using me to
[4943.42 → 4944.00] reach them?
[4944.16 → 4944.56] How?
[4944.56 → 4946.64] How are we
[4946.64 → 4947.16] going to see
[4947.16 → 4949.32] God in this
[4949.32 → 4950.08] together?
[4952.18 → 4953.72] Sometimes people
[4953.72 → 4955.06] say to me, I
[4955.06 → 4955.70] just don't know
[4955.70 → 4956.16] what I would
[4956.16 → 4956.58] say.
[4957.92 → 4958.74] My first
[4958.74 → 4959.54] response is,
[4959.92 → 4960.38] well then don't
[4960.38 → 4960.96] say anything.
[4961.88 → 4962.64] Just listen.
[4964.10 → 4965.18] Just listen
[4965.18 → 4966.84] and see what
[4966.84 → 4968.10] God will do.
[4969.14 → 4970.10] Now, listening
[4970.10 → 4970.66] leads to
[4970.66 → 4971.10] something,
[4971.10 → 4972.80] right?
[4973.50 → 4974.12] And so,
[4974.96 → 4975.40] Priscilla and
[4975.40 → 4976.20] Aquila listened
[4976.20 → 4977.04] and then they
[4977.04 → 4978.54] taught him.
[4979.68 → 4980.40] They searched
[4980.40 → 4981.02] the scriptures,
[4981.62 → 4982.34] they learned
[4982.34 → 4983.24] and lived in
[4983.24 → 4984.36] its truth as
[4984.36 → 4985.04] the path of
[4985.04 → 4985.76] discipleship.
[4986.56 → 4987.24] And over and
[4987.24 → 4987.78] over and over
[4987.78 → 4988.34] again, this
[4988.34 → 4988.96] pattern is
[4988.96 → 4989.66] affirmed for
[4989.66 → 4990.68] us in these
[4990.68 → 4991.46] stories of the
[4991.46 → 4991.94] New Testament
[4991.94 → 4992.92] about listening
[4992.92 → 4993.62] to the word
[4993.62 → 4994.24] and searching
[4994.24 → 4995.14] the word to
[4995.14 → 4995.62] see if it's
[4995.62 → 4995.80] true.
[4995.88 → 4996.30] There's a
[4996.30 → 4997.04] church in
[4997.04 → 4998.34] Berea that is
[4998.34 → 4998.98] praised for
[4998.98 → 4999.22] this.
[4999.36 → 4999.90] The Berman
[4999.90 → 5000.68] brothers and
[5000.68 → 5000.94] sisters,
[5001.10 → 5001.66] searched the
[5001.66 → 5002.62] scriptures daily
[5002.62 → 5003.94] to test what
[5003.94 → 5004.38] Paul was
[5004.38 → 5004.70] saying.
[5006.10 → 5006.68] And they
[5006.68 → 5007.38] grew and
[5007.38 → 5008.20] they're praised
[5008.20 → 5009.04] for that.
[5010.26 → 5011.56] That's how
[5011.56 → 5012.78] we do this
[5012.78 → 5013.40] as well.
[5013.62 → 5014.24] Search the
[5014.24 → 5015.66] scriptures daily.
[5016.98 → 5018.14] Teach one
[5018.14 → 5018.46] another.
[5019.10 → 5019.66] And here's
[5019.66 → 5020.10] what I'm
[5020.10 → 5020.60] saying in
[5020.60 → 5020.98] this, right?
[5021.04 → 5021.18] Your
[5021.18 → 5022.02] relationships,
[5022.26 → 5023.58] especially as
[5023.58 → 5024.62] relationships of
[5024.62 → 5026.08] discipleship or
[5026.08 → 5027.82] mentoring, need
[5027.82 → 5028.46] to be
[5028.46 → 5029.34] intentional
[5029.34 → 5030.72] relationships.
[5030.72 → 5032.78] right?
[5032.82 → 5033.22] It's not
[5033.22 → 5034.18] enough just
[5034.18 → 5035.12] to go to
[5035.12 → 5035.94] the hockey
[5035.94 → 5036.92] game with
[5036.92 → 5038.28] someone, although
[5038.28 → 5039.28] that's good, and
[5039.28 → 5039.68] do that.
[5040.10 → 5040.98] It's not enough
[5040.98 → 5041.58] just to go to
[5041.58 → 5042.76] Starbucks with
[5042.76 → 5043.36] someone, although
[5043.36 → 5044.52] that's good, and
[5044.52 → 5045.04] do that.
[5047.24 → 5049.00] But ask the
[5049.00 → 5050.68] hard questions.
[5051.42 → 5052.18] Open up the
[5052.18 → 5053.36] scriptures with
[5053.36 → 5053.86] them and say,
[5053.86 → 5055.20] what is God
[5055.20 → 5056.62] teaching us in
[5056.62 → 5058.08] this place, in
[5058.08 → 5059.48] this moment
[5059.48 → 5060.64] together?
[5062.48 → 5063.90] This, too, has
[5063.90 → 5064.38] been the
[5064.38 → 5065.50] pattern of
[5065.50 → 5066.00] scripture.
[5066.20 → 5066.60] And in this
[5066.60 → 5067.06] series, we've
[5067.06 → 5067.58] been looking at
[5067.58 → 5068.20] stories from the
[5068.20 → 5068.94] book of Acts, as
[5068.94 → 5070.14] well as stories
[5070.14 → 5071.46] from the early
[5071.46 → 5072.26] church, from the
[5072.26 → 5072.84] first few
[5072.84 → 5073.32] centuries.
[5074.28 → 5075.58] And there's a
[5075.58 → 5076.34] quote that I want
[5076.34 → 5076.96] to share with you
[5076.96 → 5078.02] from Clement of
[5078.02 → 5080.14] Alexandria, same
[5080.14 → 5080.60] place that
[5080.60 → 5081.82] Apollos was
[5081.82 → 5082.12] from.
[5083.02 → 5083.54] And so
[5083.54 → 5085.22] perhaps knew
[5085.22 → 5086.00] Apollos or a
[5086.00 → 5086.68] student of
[5086.68 → 5087.42] Apollos.
[5087.62 → 5088.18] This is a
[5088.18 → 5089.02] longer quote, so
[5089.02 → 5089.78] bear with me.
[5090.26 → 5090.88] And some of the
[5090.88 → 5091.40] language is a
[5091.40 → 5091.88] little bit tough,
[5091.96 → 5092.94] but we'll make
[5092.94 → 5093.18] through.
[5095.48 → 5096.32] Clement writes,
[5097.32 → 5098.12] but those who
[5098.12 → 5098.92] are ready to
[5098.92 → 5099.92] toil in the
[5099.92 → 5100.82] most excellent
[5100.82 → 5102.84] pursuits, hear
[5102.84 → 5104.54] that, toil in the
[5104.54 → 5105.14] most excellent
[5105.14 → 5105.98] pursuits, work
[5105.98 → 5107.88] hard at what is
[5107.88 → 5108.78] worth working
[5108.78 → 5110.50] hard at, will
[5110.50 → 5111.72] not desist from
[5111.72 → 5112.86] the search after
[5112.86 → 5114.36] truth, till they
[5114.36 → 5115.16] get the
[5115.16 → 5116.26] demonstration from
[5116.26 → 5116.86] the scriptures
[5116.86 → 5117.58] themselves.
[5118.64 → 5119.90] As then, in
[5119.90 → 5120.66] war, the
[5120.66 → 5121.60] soldier must not
[5121.60 → 5122.40] leave the post
[5122.40 → 5122.82] which the
[5122.82 → 5123.38] commander has
[5123.38 → 5124.48] assigned him, so
[5124.48 → 5125.52] neither must we
[5125.52 → 5126.54] desert the post
[5126.54 → 5127.78] assigned by the
[5127.78 → 5128.92] word, whom we
[5128.92 → 5129.90] have received as
[5129.90 → 5130.70] the guide of
[5130.70 → 5131.78] knowledge and
[5131.78 → 5132.14] life.
[5133.72 → 5134.78] But the most
[5134.78 → 5135.68] have not even
[5135.68 → 5136.34] inquired.
[5137.00 → 5137.54] And if there's
[5137.54 → 5138.02] one that we
[5138.02 → 5138.78] ought to follow,
[5139.10 → 5139.80] and who this
[5139.80 → 5140.92] is, and how he
[5140.92 → 5141.46] is to be
[5141.46 → 5142.54] followed, for as
[5142.54 → 5144.22] is the word, so
[5144.22 → 5146.02] such also must
[5146.02 → 5146.84] the believer's
[5146.84 → 5148.88] life be, so
[5148.88 → 5149.76] as to be able
[5149.76 → 5151.28] to follow God,
[5151.36 → 5152.16] who brings all
[5152.16 → 5153.12] things to end
[5153.12 → 5153.76] from the
[5153.76 → 5155.26] beginning by the
[5155.26 → 5156.38] right course.
[5157.76 → 5158.90] The idea here
[5158.90 → 5162.24] is that as
[5162.24 → 5163.78] Jesus has
[5163.78 → 5165.36] shown, the
[5165.36 → 5166.46] living word has
[5166.46 → 5168.24] shown, so we
[5168.24 → 5169.50] must follow.
[5170.56 → 5171.16] This is the
[5171.16 → 5171.66] same thing that
[5171.66 → 5172.44] Jesus says when
[5172.44 → 5173.44] he says to his
[5173.44 → 5174.40] disciples to take
[5174.40 → 5175.38] up your cross and
[5175.38 → 5176.44] to follow after
[5176.44 → 5176.68] him.
[5176.74 → 5177.28] This is the same
[5177.28 → 5178.20] thing that Jesus
[5178.20 → 5178.94] says to his
[5178.94 → 5179.74] disciples when he
[5179.74 → 5181.16] says, come after
[5181.16 → 5183.56] me, and as the
[5183.56 → 5184.32] Father has sent
[5184.32 → 5185.44] me, so I am
[5185.44 → 5186.44] sending you.
[5186.52 → 5187.14] This is the same
[5187.14 → 5188.24] thing that the
[5188.24 → 5189.14] scriptures command
[5189.14 → 5190.62] us as we wrestle
[5190.62 → 5191.74] day in and day
[5191.74 → 5192.60] out with the
[5192.60 → 5193.48] truth of God's
[5193.48 → 5194.38] word and applying
[5194.38 → 5196.34] it to our lives.
[5196.44 → 5197.54] We do this
[5197.54 → 5199.18] because Jesus has
[5199.18 → 5200.74] shown us the way
[5200.74 → 5202.04] and because Jesus
[5202.04 → 5203.32] has called us
[5203.32 → 5204.24] into this way,
[5204.36 → 5205.42] but even more
[5205.42 → 5206.00] than that,
[5206.82 → 5207.98] even more than
[5207.98 → 5208.84] because he has
[5208.84 → 5209.54] shown us and
[5209.54 → 5210.10] because he has
[5210.10 → 5211.18] called us, even
[5211.18 → 5213.16] more because he
[5213.16 → 5215.02] has done it.
[5216.48 → 5217.24] He has
[5217.24 → 5219.16] accomplished it
[5219.16 → 5220.82] for us in our
[5220.82 → 5221.16] place.
[5221.24 → 5222.22] He has lived the
[5222.22 → 5223.26] life we should have
[5223.26 → 5224.00] lived, and he has
[5224.00 → 5225.16] died the death that
[5225.16 → 5226.18] we deserve, and this
[5226.18 → 5227.50] same Jesus now
[5227.50 → 5229.64] calls you out in
[5229.64 → 5231.00] relationship, in
[5231.00 → 5231.96] discipleship, and
[5231.96 → 5234.14] says, follow me.
[5235.10 → 5236.10] Follow me.
[5237.10 → 5238.18] And for a church to
[5238.18 → 5239.90] follow Jesus, this is
[5239.90 → 5240.94] what it looks like,
[5241.80 → 5243.46] right, to pursue and
[5243.46 → 5245.32] to utilize and to
[5245.32 → 5246.80] gather these
[5246.80 → 5247.98] gifts that he has
[5247.98 → 5253.92] given and grow his
[5253.92 → 5255.26] body.
[5257.68 → 5258.64] The fifth thing
[5258.64 → 5259.92] here is that they
[5259.92 → 5261.96] sent him out.
[5262.36 → 5263.48] Now again, this is
[5263.48 → 5264.36] descriptive, not
[5264.36 → 5265.12] prescriptive.
[5265.20 → 5265.86] I'm not saying that
[5265.86 → 5266.80] you all need to go
[5266.80 → 5268.26] to Corinth after
[5268.26 → 5269.16] church on Sunday
[5269.16 → 5270.18] and be a missionary
[5270.18 → 5271.50] there, or Hawaii,
[5271.70 → 5272.70] or wherever else you
[5272.70 → 5273.46] think it might be good
[5273.46 → 5274.38] to go as a
[5274.38 → 5274.66] missionary.
[5277.10 → 5279.26] The idea is we
[5279.26 → 5280.12] are encouraged in
[5280.12 → 5281.30] the word together,
[5281.52 → 5282.44] we are grown in
[5282.44 → 5283.00] the word in
[5283.00 → 5283.88] relationship to
[5283.88 → 5284.80] one another, and
[5284.80 → 5285.78] to Jesus through
[5285.78 → 5286.90] that, and we are
[5286.90 → 5288.56] sent out with this
[5288.56 → 5289.98] same mission.
[5290.10 → 5290.60] A healthy,
[5290.82 → 5291.56] functioning church
[5291.56 → 5292.46] embraces and
[5292.46 → 5293.62] utilizes the
[5293.62 → 5294.98] spiritual gifts of
[5294.98 → 5297.04] all its members for
[5297.04 → 5298.56] the building up of
[5298.56 → 5299.22] the body.
[5300.36 → 5301.24] And if you're a
[5301.24 → 5302.04] guest with us this
[5302.04 → 5304.42] morning, I want to
[5304.42 → 5305.58] say we here at
[5305.58 → 5306.96] Emanuel are really
[5306.96 → 5307.76] good at this.
[5310.32 → 5311.96] We have, in our
[5311.96 → 5314.08] church, we have
[5314.08 → 5315.42] over, and we did
[5315.42 → 5316.06] the numbers on
[5316.06 → 5316.46] this at the
[5316.46 → 5317.12] beginning of last
[5317.12 → 5318.16] year, we have
[5318.16 → 5319.64] over 330
[5319.64 → 5321.40] volunteer positions
[5321.40 → 5321.80] available.
[5321.92 → 5322.36] That is, we have
[5322.36 → 5324.24] over 330 places for
[5324.24 → 5326.18] people to serve in
[5326.18 → 5327.14] our church.
[5328.16 → 5328.88] That's not
[5328.88 → 5329.82] including Night
[5329.82 → 5330.64] Shift or Mission
[5330.64 → 5331.60] Thrift Store or the
[5331.60 → 5332.42] Langley Food Bank.
[5333.04 → 5334.10] That's not including
[5334.10 → 5335.28] agencies outside
[5335.28 → 5335.52] our church.
[5335.56 → 5336.00] That's just
[5336.00 → 5336.56] internally.
[5336.56 → 5339.68] And for those 330
[5339.68 → 5343.80] positions, we have
[5343.80 → 5348.50] approximately 160 to
[5348.50 → 5350.16] 180, depending on
[5350.16 → 5351.98] the season, volunteers,
[5352.22 → 5353.68] individual volunteers
[5353.68 → 5355.90] serving in those
[5355.90 → 5356.36] positions.
[5356.80 → 5357.80] And that doesn't
[5357.80 → 5359.08] include the youth
[5359.08 → 5359.66] helpers.
[5360.64 → 5361.64] That doesn't include
[5361.64 → 5363.42] the kids who work in
[5363.42 → 5363.92] the nursery.
[5363.92 → 5366.96] right, this is 18
[5366.96 → 5367.74] and up.
[5369.52 → 5370.26] So that means
[5370.26 → 5372.46] somewhere around 60%
[5372.46 → 5374.84] of our people are
[5374.84 → 5375.34] volunteering.
[5376.72 → 5378.06] Now, it also means
[5378.06 → 5380.12] that our average
[5380.12 → 5382.36] volunteer does 2.29
[5382.36 → 5383.50] volunteer positions.
[5384.48 → 5385.74] So they do the work
[5385.74 → 5386.52] of almost two and a
[5386.52 → 5386.98] half people.
[5387.88 → 5389.18] But that's also, I
[5389.18 → 5389.92] think, something to
[5389.92 → 5390.82] celebrate because our
[5390.82 → 5391.70] volunteers are working
[5391.70 → 5392.50] hard.
[5392.50 → 5396.14] We get this here.
[5396.38 → 5397.20] This is part of the
[5397.20 → 5399.30] DNA of Emmanuel, and
[5399.30 → 5400.10] I think that is
[5400.10 → 5401.68] something to celebrate.
[5402.98 → 5405.46] But also, I think it
[5405.46 → 5407.22] is one of the ways that
[5407.22 → 5409.12] God is blessing this
[5409.12 → 5410.24] church and one of the
[5410.24 → 5411.90] means by which we are
[5411.90 → 5413.84] seeing growth and
[5413.84 → 5415.62] continued growth here.
[5417.24 → 5419.86] Gordon Smith writes in
[5419.86 → 5421.16] his book, Institutional
[5421.16 → 5422.32] Intelligence, he says,
[5422.50 → 5423.68] the church only
[5423.68 → 5424.96] flourishes if the
[5424.96 → 5425.64] members of the
[5425.64 → 5426.48] congregation are
[5426.48 → 5427.90] encouraged, empowered,
[5428.12 → 5429.30] and equipped to be
[5429.30 → 5430.74] what they are called
[5430.74 → 5431.54] to be.
[5435.14 → 5436.24] And this isn't a
[5436.24 → 5437.92] boast in me or in the
[5437.92 → 5438.44] other leaders.
[5438.52 → 5439.58] This is a boast in you.
[5440.54 → 5442.22] I see God doing that
[5442.22 → 5442.96] here.
[5444.24 → 5445.34] And it makes me
[5445.34 → 5447.26] wonder what more
[5447.26 → 5448.06] could God do?
[5448.06 → 5452.02] What more could he do
[5452.02 → 5453.76] as we ask ourselves
[5453.76 → 5455.20] the hard questions of
[5455.20 → 5456.12] how do I make space?
[5457.04 → 5458.24] As we ask ourselves,
[5458.38 → 5459.14] what do I need to
[5459.14 → 5459.44] learn?
[5460.16 → 5461.12] As we ask ourselves,
[5461.20 → 5461.76] who do I need to
[5461.76 → 5462.22] talk to?
[5462.68 → 5463.66] As we ask ourselves,
[5463.74 → 5464.36] who do I need to
[5464.36 → 5465.46] invite into my life?
[5465.62 → 5466.46] As we ask ourselves,
[5466.58 → 5469.06] what Bible study or
[5469.06 → 5469.82] care group do I need
[5469.82 → 5471.14] to be a part of?
[5471.14 → 5474.44] This is how God
[5474.44 → 5475.46] works.
[5477.10 → 5478.04] And I hope you've
[5478.04 → 5480.50] seen it, because God
[5480.50 → 5481.66] is at work here.
[5483.32 → 5486.00] And I, for one, want to
[5486.00 → 5488.48] see more of that work
[5488.48 → 5489.78] in our midst.
[5490.46 → 5491.54] Let's pray for that
[5491.54 → 5491.90] together.
[5491.90 → 5500.08] Lord, our God, you are
[5500.08 → 5501.80] at work among us, and
[5501.80 → 5503.06] so be at work among
[5503.06 → 5503.40] us.
[5504.56 → 5506.00] You are doing amazing
[5506.00 → 5507.38] things in our midst, and
[5507.38 → 5509.82] so cause us to see
[5509.82 → 5511.82] that and to trust in
[5511.82 → 5512.84] your provision.
[5513.08 → 5515.22] Cause us to pursue the
[5515.22 → 5516.46] work of your Spirit in
[5516.46 → 5517.88] our midst, even as you
[5517.88 → 5519.58] send us out from this
[5519.58 → 5520.62] place today.
[5521.90 → 5524.18] God, we go asking
[5524.18 → 5527.58] questions of discipleship,
[5527.84 → 5528.38] of space.
[5529.00 → 5530.40] We go asking questions
[5530.40 → 5531.84] of relationships and
[5531.84 → 5532.68] intentionality.
[5533.16 → 5534.68] We go, Lord God, asking
[5534.68 → 5535.38] questions.
[5539.04 → 5542.64] And so we go, Lord, I
[5542.64 → 5545.44] pray by your Spirit, with
[5545.44 → 5547.68] enough humility to hear
[5547.68 → 5549.36] the answer from you.
[5551.90 → 5553.92] open the eyes of our
[5553.92 → 5556.68] heart, open our ears of
[5556.68 → 5559.74] faith, that as we ask,
[5559.86 → 5561.04] as we search, as we
[5561.04 → 5563.34] wonder, as we go, we
[5563.34 → 5565.30] might hear from you.
[5566.30 → 5567.86] In Jesus' name we pray.
[5568.68 → 5569.12] Amen.
[5569.12 → 5576.22] Would you rise with us?
[5576.22 → 5606.20] Thank you.
[5606.22 → 5621.22] Nothing can compare you run-living hope, your presence hope.
[5621.22 → 5638.22] I've tasted and seen of the sweetest of love, when my heart becomes free, when my shame is undone.
[5638.22 → 5646.22] Your presence, Lord.
[5646.22 → 5655.22] Holy Spirit, you are welcome here.
[5655.22 → 5662.40] Come flood this place and fill the atmosphere.
[5663.12 → 5668.22] Your glory, Lord, is what our hearts long for.
[5669.22 → 5675.68] To be overcome by your presence, Lord.
[5675.68 → 5695.68] There's nothing but more than to ever come close.
[5695.68 → 5710.68] Nothing can compare you run-living hope, your presence hope.
[5710.68 → 5727.68] I've tasted and seen of the sweetest of love, when my heart becomes free, when my shame is undone.
[5727.68 → 5745.68] I've tasted and seen of the sweetest of love, when my heart becomes free.
[5745.68 → 5751.68] Come flood this place and fill the atmosphere.
[5752.68 → 5758.90] Your glory, Lord, is what our hearts long for.
[5758.90 → 5765.90] To be overwhelmed by your presence, Lord.
[5765.90 → 5773.90] Your presence, Lord.
[5773.90 → 5790.90] Let us experience the glory of your goodness.
[5790.90 → 5797.90] Let us become more aware of your presence.
[5797.90 → 5803.90] Let us experience the glory of your goodness.
[5803.90 → 5809.90] Let us become more aware of your presence.
[5809.90 → 5816.90] Let us experience the glory of your goodness.
[5816.90 → 5833.90] Let us experience the glory of your goodness.
[5833.90 → 5841.90] Holy Spirit, you are welcome here.
[5841.90 → 5847.90] Come flood this place and fill the atmosphere.
[5847.90 → 5853.90] Your glory, Lord, is what our hearts long for.
[5854.90 → 5865.90] To be overcome by your presence, Lord.
[5865.90 → 5884.90] Holy Spirit, you are welcome here.
[5884.90 → 5888.90] As you go this week, go with the blessing of our good God.
[5888.90 → 5893.90] Before you go, if you would like to meet with someone for prayer, we have opportunity for that.
[5893.90 → 5898.40] for that. There'll be someone up at the front here with a yellow name tag on. They would love to meet
[5898.40 → 5904.16] you and pray with you about whatever it is that you are celebrating, are lamenting, are crying out
[5904.16 → 5910.28] to God, are asking for from him. Additionally, go with an invitation to hang out for a time of
[5910.28 → 5916.44] gathering, refreshment, fellowship after our worship together. Receive the blessing of God.
[5916.44 → 5926.76] God, go before you to lead you. God, go behind you to protect you. God, go beneath you to support you.
[5927.36 → 5934.08] And God, go beside you to befriend you. Do not be afraid. Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[5934.18 → 5942.06] Do not be afraid, but go in peace to love and serve the Lord. Amen.
[5946.44 → 5968.34] You're the Lion of Judah, the Lamb who was slain. You ascended to heaven and nevermore will reign.
[5968.34 → 5976.02] At the end of the age when the earth you reclaim, they will gather the nations before you.
[5976.02 → 5987.28] And the eyes of all men will be fixed on the lam who was crucified. With wisdom and mercy and justice
[5987.28 → 6002.02] you'll reign at your Father's side. And the angels will cry, Hail the Lamb who was slain for the world's
[6002.02 → 6020.02] ruling crown. And the earth will be fixed on the earth. You shall reign as the King of all kings and the Lord of all souls.
[6020.02 → 6035.00] There's a shield in our hand and a sword at our side. There's a fire in our spirit that cannot be denied.
[6035.28 → 6042.02] As the Father has told us, for these you have died. For the nations that gather before you.
[6042.02 → 6058.02] And the ears of all men will be fixed on the lam who was crucified. Who descended to hell yet was raised up to reign at His Father's side.
[6058.02 → 6065.02] And the angels will cry, Hail the Lamb who was slain for the world's ruling power. And the earth will reply, Hail the Lamb.
[6065.02 → 6072.02] Who will slay for the Lamb who was slain for the world's ruling power. And the earth will reply, Hail the Lamb who was slain for the world's ruling power.
[6072.02 → 6102.00] And the earth will reply, Hail the Lamb who was slain for the world's ruling power. And the earth will reply, Hail the Lamb who was slain for the world's ruling power.
[6102.00 → 6109.00] Hail the Lamb who was slain for the world's ruling power. And the Lord of all souls.
[6109.00 → 6111.00] Hail the Lamb.
[6111.00 → 6116.06] Hail the Lamb.
[6116.06 → 6118.44] Hail the Lamb.
[6118.44 → 6121.64] Hail the Lamb.
[6121.64 → 6122.44] Hail the Lamb.
[6122.44 → 6126.38] Hail the Lamb.
[6126.46 → 6131.40] Hail the Lamb.
[6131.40 → 6161.38] Thank you.
[6161.40 → 6191.38] Thank you.
[6191.40 → 6193.40] Thank you.
