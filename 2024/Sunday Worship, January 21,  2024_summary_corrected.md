• The speaker wants to discuss discipleship with a starting point for an ongoing conversation
• Paul's statement that "all Israel will be saved" is questioned, specifically what he means by "all Israel without distinction"
• The mechanism for this salvation is also discussed
• Assumptions are made about the interpretation of scripture, including:
  • That Paul won't contradict himself in Romans chapters 9-11 and throughout his letters
  • That there are no contradictions within the New Testament canon
  • That there are no contradictions between the Old and New Testaments
• Consistency of Scripture
• Shared doctrine of inspiration
• No contradictions in the Bible, but difficult passages to reconcile
• Scripture's infallibility and God-breathed nature
• Need for context and understanding Scripture as a whole to interpret individual teachings
• Paul's teaching on salvation by faith in Jesus Christ
• The speaker explains that it can be confusing to understand who Paul is referring to as "all Israel" in Galatians 26
• Paul distinguishes between ethnic Israel and spiritual Israel in Galatians 9:6-8, stating that not all descendants of Israel are truly part of Israel
• He emphasizes that children of the promise (Abraham's descendants) are true Israelites
• In Galatians 10:12, Paul reiterates that there is no difference between Jew and Gentile in terms of salvation by faith
• The speaker notes that Paul returns to distinguishing ethnic Israel from spiritual Israel in Galatians 10:16-21
• He highlights the concept of a remnant chosen by God's grace in Galatians 11:5
• The speaker discusses the meaning of "Israel" in Romans 11
• Different interpretations of what "all Israel" refers to: ethnic or spiritual Israel
• The speaker disagrees with John Calvin's interpretation that it refers to a spiritual marker, not an ethnic one
• The use of the tree metaphor in Romans 11 is discussed and contrasted with Paul's actual usage of the word
• The concept of salvation coming to Gentiles to make Israel envious is referenced
• The concept of "Gentiles" as an ethnic marker for non-Jewish people is discussed
• Paul's promise in verse 23 that Israel will be grafted back in if they do not persist in unbelief
• The metaphor of the olive tree, where unbelieving Israel has been cut off and believing Gentiles have been grafted back in
• Paul's promise that Israel can be grafted back into the tree as a natural branch
• The contrast between Gentiles who believe and ethnic Israel who does not (or did not) believe
• The speaker describes Paul's explanation of Israel as a mystery
• The speaker argues that if Paul was only referring to elected Gentiles and the remnant of Jews, it wouldn't be a mystery
• The speaker believes that the concept of "all Israel" is difficult to understand, which is why it's more likely to be true
• The speaker explains that when Paul uses the word "all", he means ethnic Israel in a general sense
• The speaker references 2 Chronicles 12:1 as an example of how the phrase "all Israel" can refer to a broader group
• The speaker argues that Jeroboam, king of Judah, is referred to as "king over all Israel" in Chronicles, demonstrating how the term can be used to refer to a larger entity
• The Chronicles of Israel are interesting because all Israel had abandoned the law of the Lord, yet a prophet prophesied about a king named Josiah who would bring the people back to God.
• In 1 Kings 13, there is a recounting of a man of God from Judah who prophesies that a king will come and gives his name as Josiah in the line of David.
• Josiah becomes king around 300 years after Jeroboam and brings reforms to bring the people back to God.
• The Bible describes all Israel as walking away, but with exceptions, allowing for distinctions within it.
• This distinction is relevant because Paul's reference to "all Israel" in Romans 11:26 may be referring to a mass of Jewish people who will be saved.
• Paul's use of the word "Israel" in Romans chapter 11
• Israel as referring to both ethnic and spiritual identities
• The concept of a believing remnant within Israel
• Possible interpretations of Paul's words, including end times or mass revival scenarios
• Contrasting views among scholars on what Paul intended
• Paul's language allows for a steady but growing number of Jews to become Christian
• This process would eventually lead to most believing in Jesus
• Paul's confidence comes from his interpretation of Isaiah and God's plan of salvation
• Ethnic Israel matters in God's plan of salvation, and a day will come when most of them remember their role
• The ground of their salvation is the same as for others
• Salvation is granted by God's mercy
• Paul says that if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in
• The promise must be believed for it to be effective
• Faith is necessary for the promise to be realized
• Scripture should interpret Scripture when studying the Bible
• Salvation is a gift from God's grace
• Faith in Christ unites us to Him and grants salvation
• The true descendants of Father Abraham are those who do His will, recognizing Jesus as the one true Son
• It is by God's choosing and grace that we are saved through faith
• Salvation is not earned by works but is a gift from God.
• The way of salvation is the same for Israel as it is for all people
• Belief in Jesus as Messiah and Lord is required for salvation
• Faith is granted to the elect, but also requires human response
• God's mercy is the determining factor for salvation, not human effort or desire
• God can use unbelief among one group (Israel) to spur faith among another group (Gentiles)
• Gentile believers are included as heirs of the promise and seeds of Abraham
• God will eventually bring Israel back to faith through the example of Gentile believers.
• The concept of the "boomerang of salvation" where God's mercy is given to Gentiles due to Jewish rejection, but ultimately returns to Israel
• Belief in Jesus as Messiah, Lord, and Son of God is necessary for salvation for both Gentiles and ethnic Israel
• There will be a greater number of Jews who believe than expected, with Paul's hope rooted in God's promise and call
• The reality that God's word accomplishes its purpose, and all peoples (Gentiles and Jews) will receive mercy and believe through faith by grace
• The concept of God's mercy being available to all peoples, regardless of faith background.
• The idea that humility is necessary for Gentile believers, as emphasized by Paul in chapter 11.
• The reassurance that nothing can thwart God's plan of salvation, including rejection or stubbornness.
• The comfort and assurance that God will ultimately bring about the salvation He has decreed.
• The speaker has a plan that will not be thwarted, regardless of the efforts of parents
• God's mission through the church is to proclaim the gospel to all people
• Jesus Christ lived the life we should have lived and died the death we deserve, making him the Lord over all creation
• This undergirds our call to mission and encourages us to go forth and proclaim the gospel
• No one comes to God except through Jesus Christ
• The assurance of eternal salvation through Jesus
