[0.00 --> 7.28]  So he let those soldiers take him in
[7.28 --> 13.50]  As his friend betrayed him with a kiss
[13.50 --> 19.26]  And there before the mocking crowd
[19.26 --> 25.62]  Like a lamb to the slaughtered maker's town
[25.62 --> 31.08]  And he carried that cross to Calvary
[31.08 --> 37.50]  And he shed his blood to set us free
[37.50 --> 43.34]  As the nails weeding and the sky were dark
[43.34 --> 49.60]  The redemption of the world was on his heart
[49.60 --> 54.90]  Friday's good, good Sunday is coming
[54.90 --> 61.24]  Don't lose hope, good Sunday is coming
[61.24 --> 67.24]  Devil, you're done, you better start running
[67.24 --> 72.90]  Friday's good, good Sunday is coming
[72.90 --> 85.34]  Then he breathed his last and bowed his head
[85.34 --> 91.24]  The Son of God and man was dead
[91.24 --> 97.58]  With bloody hands, tears on their face
[97.58 --> 103.50]  They laid him down inside that grave
[103.50 --> 106.72]  But that wasn't the end
[106.72 --> 109.84]  That wasn't the end
[109.84 --> 112.30]  That wasn't the end
[112.30 --> 115.26]  Let me tell you what happened next
[115.26 --> 121.26]  The women came before the dawn
[121.26 --> 126.60]  To find that stone already gone
[126.60 --> 133.28]  When they looked inside the angels said
[133.28 --> 138.62]  Why are you looking for the living among the dead?
[138.62 --> 139.62]  He's alive
[139.62 --> 140.96]  He's alive
[140.96 --> 141.96]  He's alive
[141.96 --> 142.96]  Hallelujah
[142.96 --> 143.96]  He's alive
[143.96 --> 145.96]  Give him praise
[145.96 --> 146.90]  Lift him hack
[146.90 --> 147.98]  Hallelujah
[147.98 --> 148.92]  He's alive
[148.92 --> 150.92]  He's alive
[150.92 --> 151.98]  He's alive
[151.98 --> 152.66]  He's alive
[153.30 --> 154.28]  Hallelujah
[154.28 --> 156.36]  He's alive
[156.36 --> 157.10]  Give him praise
[157.10 --> 159.52]  Lift him hack
[159.52 --> 160.68]  Hallelujah
[160.68 --> 162.46]  He's alive
[162.46 --> 168.96]  Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[168.96 --> 175.00]  Don't lose hope, this Sunday is coming
[175.00 --> 180.96]  Hallelujah, Hallelujah
[180.96 --> 193.16]  Now Jesus reigns upon the throne
[193.16 --> 199.16]  Our heaven sings to Him alone
[199.16 --> 205.60]  We watch and wait like a bride for a groom
[205.60 --> 211.22]  Oh church arise, He's coming soon
[211.22 --> 223.14]  I searched the world
[223.14 --> 228.84]  But it couldn't fill me
[228.84 --> 235.86]  Melted empty prayers, treasures of faith
[235.86 --> 238.46]  Are never enough
[238.46 --> 243.58]  Then You came along
[243.58 --> 248.84]  And put me back together
[248.84 --> 256.24]  And every desire is now satisfied
[256.24 --> 259.46]  Here in Your love
[259.46 --> 267.62]  Oh there's nothing better than You
[267.62 --> 272.66]  There's nothing better than You
[272.66 --> 274.66]  Lord there's nothing
[274.66 --> 279.66]  Nothing is better than You
[279.66 --> 284.48]  Oh, yes I know it's true
[284.48 --> 286.66]  Come on, talk
[286.66 --> 287.34]  Hey
[287.34 --> 290.10]  I'm not afraid
[290.10 --> 295.66]  To show You my weakness
[295.66 --> 299.66]  My failures and flaws
[299.66 --> 302.38]  Lord You've seen them all
[302.38 --> 306.06]  And You still call me friends
[306.06 --> 310.66]  Cause the God of the mountains
[310.66 --> 315.66]  Is the God of the valleys
[315.66 --> 320.62]  There's another place
[320.62 --> 322.62]  Your mercy and grace
[322.62 --> 323.16]  Your mercy and grace
[323.16 --> 327.62]  Won't find me again
[327.62 --> 329.10]  Come on now
[329.10 --> 334.56]  Oh there's nothing better than You
[334.56 --> 337.62]  There's nothing, Lord
[337.62 --> 339.62]  There's nothing, Lord
[339.62 --> 341.62]  Oh there's nothing
[341.62 --> 346.62]  Nothing is better than You
[346.62 --> 348.62]  I know it's true
[348.62 --> 350.62]  Oh there's nothing
[350.62 --> 351.62]  Oh there's nothing
[351.62 --> 352.62]  Somebody testify
[352.62 --> 353.62]  Somebody testify
[353.62 --> 354.62]  Better than You
[354.62 --> 356.62]  Oh there's nothing
[356.62 --> 357.62]  Oh there's nothing
[357.62 --> 358.62]  Nothing more
[358.62 --> 359.62]  Better than You
[359.62 --> 361.62]  Oh there's nothing
[361.62 --> 362.62]  Oh there's nothing
[362.62 --> 366.62]  Nothing is better than You
[366.62 --> 371.62]  Hey, he's never made a way for You
[371.62 --> 372.62]  I want you to sing this
[372.62 --> 374.62]  Come on, set up the roof off
[374.62 --> 379.62]  You turn born into dancing
[379.62 --> 384.62]  You give beauty for ashes
[384.62 --> 389.62]  You turn shame into glory
[389.62 --> 394.62]  You're the only one who cares

[408.62 --> 409.62]  Come on
[409.62 --> 410.62]  Come on
[410.62 --> 411.62]  You turn shame into glory

[544.62 --> 548.62]  microphones and I don't mix very well
[548.62 --> 550.62]  that's what I've learned in my life
[550.62 --> 552.62]  good morning everyone
[552.62 --> 554.62]  it's good to see you here this morning
[554.62 --> 556.62]  on this I don't know
[556.62 --> 558.62]  first Sunday of spring break for many of the students
[558.62 --> 560.62]  here I've got one quick announcement
[560.62 --> 562.62]  before we begin today and that's just to
[562.62 --> 564.62]  inform you all that the Mexico
[564.62 --> 566.62]  team took off yesterday
[566.62 --> 568.62]  they launched from this church
[568.62 --> 570.62]  at 7 a.m. they arrived in Mexico
[570.62 --> 572.62]  safe and sound last night
[572.62 --> 574.62]  and they are on their way to church
[574.62 --> 576.62]  in fact they're probably starting church
[576.62 --> 578.62]  right now as well in Tijuana, Mexico
[578.62 --> 580.62]  so they're there doing their thing and that's very good news

[588.62 --> 590.62]  and so I invite you now to stand

[592.62 --> 594.62]  this morning or God's greeting
[594.62 --> 596.62]  sorry for us this morning
[596.62 --> 598.62]  God's greeting today
[598.62 --> 600.62]  comes from Revelation
[600.62 --> 602.62]  chapter 1 where it says
[602.62 --> 604.62]  grace and peace to you
[604.62 --> 606.62]  from him who is and who was
[606.62 --> 608.62]  and who is to come and from the
[608.62 --> 610.62]  heaven spirits before his throne
[610.62 --> 612.62]  and from Jesus Christ who is
[612.62 --> 614.62]  the faithful witness the firstborn
[614.62 --> 616.62]  of the dead and the ruler of
[616.62 --> 618.62]  the kings of the earth
[618.62 --> 620.62]  amen as God has greeted us
[620.62 --> 622.62]  this morning please take a moment
[622.62 --> 624.62]  to greet those around you as well
[638.62 --> 642.62]  good morning our call to worship this morning comes from Isaiah
[642.62 --> 650.62]  25
[650.62 --> 663.94]  Good morning.
[664.86 --> 668.88]  Our call to worship this morning comes from Isaiah 25.
[670.32 --> 671.92]  Lord, you are my God.
[672.36 --> 674.80]  I will exalt you and praise your name.
[674.80 --> 678.66]  For in perfect faithfulness you have done wonderful things.
[678.66 --> 680.94]  Things planned long ago.
[681.72 --> 685.40]  Please join me in prayer as we begin a time of worship together this morning.
[686.86 --> 690.76]  Heavenly Father, as we come before you today as a family of believers,
[691.10 --> 694.80]  we are grateful for the privilege of gathering in your presence.
[695.62 --> 702.50]  As we begin this time of worship, may our unity in you be a reflection of your presence here among us.
[703.30 --> 705.50]  Bless each soul present here.
[705.50 --> 709.00]  And may our hearts, lifted in worship, be pleasing to you.

[800.86 --> 806.66]  Rising up to take their place
[806.66 --> 809.14]  With self-attentance
[809.14 --> 812.92]  With self-attentance
[812.92 --> 818.10]  I see a new revival

[823.10 --> 825.84]  We're on our knees
[825.84 --> 828.92]  We're on our knees

[867.96 --> 870.22]  To the plains of sea
[870.22 --> 874.48]  Show me how to love I live
[874.48 --> 878.64]  And love with me
[878.64 --> 884.28]  And bring my honor, Rachel

[1446.26 --> 1450.34]  Lord God, you are love
[1450.34 --> 1454.54]  And it's evidenced by your sacrifice for us on the cross
[1454.54 --> 1457.42]  Your love feels our pain
[1457.42 --> 1459.38]  And it wipes away our tears
[1459.38 --> 1461.84]  Your love knows our grief
[1461.84 --> 1462.96]  And it comforts us
[1462.96 --> 1465.34]  Your love sees our sins
[1465.34 --> 1466.32]  And our failings
[1466.32 --> 1468.54]  And it forgives those who repent
[1468.54 --> 1472.46]  Forgive us when we fail to live lives that reflect your love
[1472.46 --> 1476.88]  Forgive us for the many times when we have taken your love
[1476.88 --> 1479.32]  And all that you have done for us for granted
[1479.32 --> 1483.34]  Transform us through your spirit, we pray
[1483.34 --> 1488.62]  And empower us to love and serve you this day and all days
[1488.62 --> 1489.64]  Amen
[1489.64 --> 1490.84]  Amen
[1490.84 --> 1491.68]  Amen
[1491.68 --> 1492.26]  mmm
[1492.26 --> 1494.68]  Amen
[1494.68 --> 1498.28]  Amen
[1498.28 --> 1502.52]  Amen
[1502.78 --> 1506.38]  Amen
[1506.38 --> 1507.02]  Amen
[1507.02 --> 1508.04]  Amen
[1508.04 --> 1509.26]  Amen
[1509.26 --> 1509.84]  Amen
[1509.84 --> 1515.96]  Amen
[1515.96 --> 1518.36]  Amen
[1518.36 --> 1526.48]  It goes beyond the highest storm
[1526.48 --> 1532.76]  That reaches to the lowest down
[1532.76 --> 1539.98]  The guilty man bowed down with care
[1539.98 --> 1546.40]  God gave His love to win
[1546.40 --> 1553.40]  His every child be reconciled
[1553.40 --> 1559.40]  And pardoned from His sin
[1559.40 --> 1566.40]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[1566.40 --> 1572.40]  How bad your hands and soul
[1572.40 --> 1579.40]  It shall forevermore and through
[1579.40 --> 1585.40]  Thus sings an angel song
[1585.40 --> 1592.40]  When years of time
[1592.40 --> 1595.40]  Shall pass away
[1595.40 --> 1598.40]  And earth be told
[1598.40 --> 1602.40]  And kingdom's own
[1602.40 --> 1605.40]  When men who hear
[1605.40 --> 1608.40]  Refuse to pray
[1608.40 --> 1612.40]  On rocks and hills
[1612.40 --> 1615.40]  And mountains fall
[1615.40 --> 1618.40]  The love so sure
[1618.40 --> 1621.40]  Shall still endure
[1621.40 --> 1622.40]  All men who hear
[1622.40 --> 1624.40]  All men who hear
[1624.40 --> 1628.40]  And strong
[1628.40 --> 1631.40]  Bring in praise
[1631.40 --> 1636.50]  Therese by
[1636.50 --> 1639.40]  Yes i t烈
[1639.40 --> 1654.40]  Oh, love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong.
[1654.40 --> 1667.34]  It shall forever endure the saints and angels' song.
[1669.40 --> 1683.58]  We live in the ocean filled, and where the sky of the morning came,
[1683.58 --> 1696.58]  where every song on earth would live, and every man that starved our day.
[1696.58 --> 1709.52]  To let the power of God above would trade the ocean down.
[1709.52 --> 1721.52]  The goodness strong, the dream of all, will spread from sky to sky.
[1721.52 --> 1734.46]  Oh, love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong.
[1734.46 --> 1746.46]  It shall forever endure the saints and angels' song.
[1746.46 --> 1759.46]  Oh, love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong.
[1759.46 --> 1773.46]  It shall forevermore endure the saints and angels' song.
[1773.46 --> 1778.46]  Oh, love of God, how rich and pure, how rich and pure, how rich and pure, how rich and pure.
[1778.46 --> 1780.46]  Please do the next song.
[1780.46 --> 1787.46]  Please do the next song.
[1787.46 --> 1798.90]  Please do the next song.
[1798.90 --> 1810.34]  And earth has quaked before, moved by the sound of His voice.
[1811.92 --> 1821.34]  And God shared an answer, bringing all to prove Him for my reward.
[1821.34 --> 1829.34]  Through it all, through it all, my eyes are on You.
[1830.08 --> 1834.34]  Through it all, through it all, it is well.
[1836.84 --> 1842.34]  Through it all, through it all, my eyes are on You.
[1842.34 --> 1848.34]  It is well with me.
[1851.34 --> 1862.34]  For it be it for me to not believe.
[1862.34 --> 1880.34]  Even when my eyes are in the sun, and the mountain that's in front of me, will you fall into the midst of the sun?
[1880.34 --> 1888.34]  Through it all, through it all, my eyes are on You.
[1889.34 --> 1893.34]  Through it all, through it all, it is well.
[1893.34 --> 1902.34]  Through it all, through it all, my eyes are on You.
[1902.34 --> 1908.34]  It is well, it is well.
[1908.34 --> 1915.34]  Let go my soul and trust in Him.
[1915.34 --> 1921.34]  With the wind to know His name.
[1921.34 --> 1928.34]  Let go my soul and trust in Him.
[1928.34 --> 1934.34]  With the wind to know His name.
[1934.34 --> 1947.34]  With the wind to know His name.
[1947.34 --> 1949.34]  The wind to know His name.
[1949.34 --> 1954.34]  The wind to know His name.
[1954.34 --> 1968.34]  It is well with my soul.
[1968.34 --> 1969.34]  It is well with my soul.
[1969.34 --> 1970.34]  In the sun.
[1970.34 --> 1975.34]  It is well with my soul.
[1975.34 --> 1976.34]  it is well with my soul.
[1976.34 --> 1982.34]  with my soul.
[1982.34 --> 1988.34]  In the sun.
[1988.34 --> 1993.66]  In the sun.
[1993.66 --> 2007.66]  It is love, it is love with my soul.
[2007.66 --> 2019.66]  It is love with my soul.
[2019.66 --> 2031.66]  It is love with my soul.
[2031.66 --> 2045.66]  It is love with my soul.
[2045.66 --> 2057.66]  It is love, it is love with my soul.
[2057.66 --> 2069.66]  It is love, it is love with my soul.
[2069.66 --> 2081.66]  It is love, it is love with my soul.
[2081.66 --> 2091.66]  It is love, it is love.
[2091.66 --> 2097.66]  Through it all, my eyes are on you.
[2097.66 --> 2103.66]  Through it all, through it all, it is love.
[2103.66 --> 2110.66]  Through it all, through it all, my eyes are on you.
[2110.66 --> 2122.66]  It is love with my soul.
[2122.66 --> 2134.66]  Through it all, through it all, through it all.
[2134.66 --> 2138.66]  Good morning, my name is Mike and I'm a deacon with this church.
[2138.66 --> 2143.66]  And we're going to take a moment now to give of our gifts that God has given us.
[2143.66 --> 2146.66]  And our offering today is for the Benevolence Fund.
[2146.66 --> 2156.66]  And for those that don't know what that is, it is a special fund that the deacons administer on behalf of this church family for special needs in our church, but also that come to us from outside the community.
[2156.66 --> 2158.66]  So thank you for giving.
[2158.66 --> 2160.66]  Lord, You have my heart and I will search for Your message
[2165.66 --> 2166.14]  Cause we're all for you for
[2166.14 --> 2183.24]  Lord, you have my heart
[2183.24 --> 2187.96]  And I will search for yours
[2187.96 --> 2195.34]  Jesus, take my life and lead me on
[2195.34 --> 2201.96]  Lord, you have my heart
[2201.96 --> 2207.02]  And I will search for yours
[2207.02 --> 2213.10]  Let me be to you a sacrifice
[2213.10 --> 2221.30]  And I will praise you
[2221.30 --> 2225.92]  Lord, I will praise you
[2225.92 --> 2231.92]  I will sing of my condemnation
[2231.92 --> 2235.92]  I will sing of my condemnation
[2235.92 --> 2241.92]  I will show your face
[2241.92 --> 2247.54]  Let's see your glory
[2247.54 --> 2264.16]  Lord, you have my heart
[2264.16 --> 2268.16]  And I will search for yours
[2268.16 --> 2275.78]  Jesus, take my life and lead me on
[2275.78 --> 2280.78]  Lord, you have my heart
[2280.78 --> 2285.78]  And I will search for yours
[2285.78 --> 2292.40]  Let me give you a sacrifice
[2292.40 --> 2299.40]  And I will praise you
[2299.40 --> 2303.40]  Lord, I will praise you
[2303.40 --> 2307.40]  Lord, I will sing of love
[2307.40 --> 2312.02]  Come down and sing of love
[2312.02 --> 2318.02]  And I will show your praise
[2318.02 --> 2336.72]  We'll see your glory
[2336.72 --> 2351.74]  If I could have all the kids, I think age 3 up to grade 4, come join me at the front.
[2352.30 --> 2356.96]  We'll have a quick chat and the children's blessing, and then we'll go to children's worship time.
[2357.78 --> 2358.50]  Oh boy.
[2359.82 --> 2363.20]  Hi guys.
[2363.90 --> 2364.84]  There's lots of you today.
[2364.84 --> 2368.94]  I wasn't sure how many would be here because I think a lot of us are on spring break.
[2369.50 --> 2374.48]  Hey, you guys know one of my favorite things is about coming to children's worship time?
[2374.98 --> 2379.90]  Is that you guys always have crazy stories you have to tell all the time.
[2379.96 --> 2381.68]  You always have things you want to share, right?
[2382.74 --> 2386.98]  Can anyone think of anything they're going to want to share maybe later in children's worship time?
[2387.20 --> 2387.98]  Don't tell me yet.
[2388.08 --> 2388.82]  Don't tell me yet.
[2389.48 --> 2393.16]  Do you have a good story that you can think of that you're just dying to tell somebody?
[2393.42 --> 2394.68]  Put your hand up if you do.
[2394.84 --> 2395.28]  Me.
[2395.52 --> 2396.30]  Yeah, you do?
[2396.74 --> 2397.78]  Okay, we'll talk later.
[2398.46 --> 2398.86]  Yeah.
[2399.54 --> 2401.72]  I went to a birthday party yesterday.
[2401.84 --> 2403.86]  That's the story I want to tell everybody about.
[2404.16 --> 2406.78]  I went to Pastor Kevin's birthday party yesterday.
[2407.20 --> 2407.42]  Yeah.
[2407.94 --> 2410.68]  We talked about lions and bears and tigers.
[2411.50 --> 2411.94]  Yep.
[2412.26 --> 2412.46]  Yep.
[2412.54 --> 2413.70]  And we ate nachos.
[2413.88 --> 2415.38]  And I have way more things to tell you.
[2416.18 --> 2421.40]  So today, we're going to talk about how exciting it is to tell our big stories.
[2421.66 --> 2426.90]  And we all have a really big story to tell when Easter comes around, right?
[2427.66 --> 2430.12]  So we're going to talk about that some more in children's worship time today.
[2430.12 --> 2438.18]  We're starting to talk about the book of John and about the extravagant story that God has for us all in that book.
[2438.60 --> 2440.78]  So I think we'll talk more until it's worship time.
[2440.88 --> 2441.02]  Yeah?
[2441.82 --> 2442.06]  Okay.
[2442.14 --> 2444.54]  And I want to hear some of you guys' big stories too today, okay?
[2444.60 --> 2445.72]  So think about that.
[2446.10 --> 2451.74]  But let's stand together with the church and we'll bless them and they will bless us in return as we go to worship time.
[2451.74 --> 2479.96]  Good morning, everyone.
[2479.96 --> 2480.98]  My name's Eric.
[2480.98 --> 2481.98]  Eric.
[2481.98 --> 2487.92]  I am an elder here at Emanuel and I'm going to lead you through family prayer.
[2488.08 --> 2490.96]  A couple of things before I start my prayer.
[2492.20 --> 2499.70]  Just found out this morning from Kevin that a lot of us here know a gentleman named John Coning who used to attend here.
[2500.18 --> 2506.76]  He was suffering from melanoma and I guess his cancer is no more.
[2506.76 --> 2509.28]  So we heard from the doctor this week that he's cleared of cancer.
[2509.28 --> 2511.28]  So that's a...
[2511.28 --> 2512.28]  Thank you.
[2512.28 --> 2513.28]  Thank you.
[2513.28 --> 2514.28]  Thank you.
[2514.28 --> 2515.28]  Thank you.
[2515.28 --> 2516.28]  Thank you.
[2516.28 --> 2517.28]  Thank you.
[2517.28 --> 2518.28]  Thank you.
[2518.28 --> 2519.28]  Thank you.
[2519.28 --> 2520.28]  Thank you.
[2520.28 --> 2521.28]  Thank you.
[2521.28 --> 2522.28]  Thank you.
[2522.28 --> 2523.28]  Thank you.
[2523.28 --> 2524.28]  Thank you.
[2524.28 --> 2525.28]  Thank you.
[2525.28 --> 2526.28]  Thank you.
[2526.28 --> 2527.28]  Thank you.
[2527.28 --> 2528.28]  Thank you.
[2528.28 --> 2529.28]  Thank you.
[2529.28 --> 2530.28]  Thank you.
[2530.28 --> 2531.28]  Thank you.
[2531.28 --> 2532.28]  Thank you.
[2532.28 --> 2533.78]  Very, thank you.
[2533.78 --> 2534.28]  I going to抽 this out for a beautiful day.
[2534.28 --> 2537.28]  And Kelly Casa spirit, St. Enola, I'm happy for that.
[2537.28 --> 2538.28]  Thank you, St. Enola.
[2538.28 --> 2539.28]  Thank you.
[2539.28 --> 2541.18]  Thank you, I've been with you.
[2541.18 --> 2549.60]  All our mission teams from all over the place, whether from here and from other schools and churches, are out there right now spreading the word.
[2550.38 --> 2552.36]  So please join me in prayer.
[2556.18 --> 2559.86]  Gracious God, what a wonderful day you have offered us.
[2560.34 --> 2566.16]  How life-giving is the sun and the warmth not only of your creation, but for us as humans as well.
[2566.16 --> 2574.92]  After what seems like a long winter, we welcome the spring and the energy and positivity that comes with the warmth, the longer days, and the sunshine.
[2576.34 --> 2585.14]  The changing of the seasons are a witness to your power, control, and the intricate details of creation that are evidence that you are the only creator.
[2586.84 --> 2594.00]  Being on this earth, Lord, has its joys and excitement, but we all have to navigate many challenges and difficulties along the way.
[2594.00 --> 2603.62]  Why, Lord, we ask, to so many of these trials and tribulations that happen, and why do some have more struggles than others?
[2604.74 --> 2612.32]  For many of us, we are walking the road of difficulty and trials with our friends and family, and that carries its own burdens.
[2612.32 --> 2621.80]  How, Lord, do we encourage and support our friend who has been struck with cancer and has a young family that needs him dearly?
[2623.06 --> 2631.44]  How, Lord, do we walk the road with a family member who suffers from mental health, and simply trying to understand it, let alone offering support, is so very difficult?
[2631.44 --> 2638.62]  How, Lord, do we encourage and support someone who is lonely and is longing for companionship or deeper friendship?
[2640.76 --> 2649.98]  How do we support our young people and our children who make poor decisions, and as parents and community, you try to encourage and guide them when they don't necessarily want to hear it?
[2649.98 --> 2657.60]  How do we go through life, Lord, when one of our loved ones has passed away and has left a huge hole in our lives?
[2659.16 --> 2667.38]  How do we see one of our children carrying a burden, and we can't carry that burden for them, and we have to, all we can do is support and love them?
[2667.38 --> 2689.56]  How do we use them to Why does it, and we can't love them, and heal our lives once again?
[2689.56 --> 2693.48]  up in Smithers as they try to make sense of the declining health of Rachel.
[2694.64 --> 2697.48]  We ask for prayer for Rachel as she deals with her illness.
[2698.54 --> 2701.90]  We pray for Matthew as he supports his wife and children through this time.
[2702.52 --> 2706.48]  We pray for the kids as they try to make sense of what their mom is going through.
[2707.24 --> 2711.42]  And we pray for the family and friends of Matt and Rachel as they support them through this time.
[2712.46 --> 2718.10]  We pray for Kobe DeBoersep, grandson of former members of ours who is fighting through leukemia at this time.
[2718.10 --> 2723.12]  It doesn't really seem to make sense that a young person should have to carry this kind of a burden.
[2723.98 --> 2727.30]  We pray for healing and strength for this family through this time.
[2728.74 --> 2734.26]  This time of the year with spring break around the corner, we have many in our midst who go on vacation or missions trips.
[2735.34 --> 2741.06]  Lord, please keep all our loved ones safe who are going on missions trips from either Emmanuel or other places.
[2741.46 --> 2745.56]  And may your Holy Spirit work and guide them in the work they are doing to spread the word.
[2745.56 --> 2750.86]  Please bring them all back safely to us as well as those who are on vacation.
[2752.88 --> 2756.04]  Thank you, Lord, for the opportunity to have classes happen a week ago.
[2756.26 --> 2760.56]  It is good to meet and to hear how you are working in our world and in our churches.
[2762.44 --> 2767.04]  And here, Lord Emmanuel, we thank you for this great church and its great people and staff.
[2767.04 --> 2773.84]  We continue to bless our staff and volunteers as they carry out your work.
[2774.32 --> 2781.98]  Help us, Lord, in the next few weeks to find leaders in our church to come forward to fill the roles needed on council through nominations.
[2781.98 --> 2790.82]  With all that's going on in this world and in our lives, we must go into this week ahead knowing that you are in our corner.
[2791.56 --> 2796.36]  And that you will care for us knowing not a hair falls from our head without our Father knowing.
[2797.88 --> 2800.06]  And as the song we just sang said,
[2800.62 --> 2805.64]  Through it all, through it all, Lord, help us to keep our eyes on you.
[2806.60 --> 2809.48]  Through it all, through it all, it is well.
[2809.48 --> 2818.02]  Help us to trust and obey, for there is no other way to be happy in you, Jesus, than to trust and obey.
[2818.78 --> 2819.04]  Amen.
[2831.92 --> 2833.52]  Yes, it was my birthday yesterday.
[2833.66 --> 2835.52]  Yes, Mike Prince did come over to my house.
[2835.52 --> 2839.74]  And yes, we did discuss lions and tigers and bears at that party.
[2840.28 --> 2844.74]  The question was, if you were hiking, would you rather come across a big grizzly bear or a cougar?
[2845.26 --> 2847.32]  And that debate lasted a good hour and a half.
[2849.18 --> 2850.86]  Something else happened to me this week.
[2851.00 --> 2855.30]  I was at a coffee shop here in Langley with a couple of other youth pastors.
[2855.44 --> 2858.10]  We were doing some work for Reactivate this year,
[2858.10 --> 2862.50]  which once again is coming to Emmanuel in September this year, which we're very excited about.
[2862.50 --> 2868.68]  I was up ordering the drinks, the coffees for these two youth pastors,
[2868.68 --> 2873.96]  and I was finishing my order, and the cashier asked, the barista asked, is there anything else?
[2874.06 --> 2876.38]  And a young gentleman walked in at that moment.
[2876.44 --> 2877.74]  He's like, yeah, put mine on there, too.
[2877.78 --> 2879.22]  And I was like, yeah, okay, sure.
[2879.72 --> 2880.42]  Put his on there, too.
[2880.44 --> 2881.16]  He was like, no, no.
[2881.20 --> 2881.78]  I was joking.
[2881.88 --> 2882.14]  I was joking.
[2882.24 --> 2883.48]  He was like, no, no, add it to the bill.
[2883.70 --> 2884.66]  He's like, no, no, no, I couldn't.
[2884.70 --> 2884.98]  It's fine.
[2885.02 --> 2886.40]  I was like, all right, your call.
[2886.44 --> 2890.46]  And I went to pay, and I tapped my credit card, and the machine didn't work.
[2890.46 --> 2893.66]  And so I pulled out a different card, and I tried that one, and again, the machine didn't work.
[2894.12 --> 2895.88]  And I said, oh, dude, I'm so sorry.
[2895.98 --> 2898.06]  Like, I think I broke the machine.
[2898.18 --> 2899.70]  And she's like, no, it's not your card.
[2899.76 --> 2900.38]  It's actually a machine.
[2900.44 --> 2900.98]  Give me a second.
[2901.10 --> 2903.42]  I'll fix the internet connection or whatever.
[2903.50 --> 2903.96]  It'll all be fine.
[2904.38 --> 2905.34]  She's like, you go sit down.
[2905.48 --> 2906.48]  I'll come call you up later.
[2906.54 --> 2906.92]  So I did.
[2907.04 --> 2907.58]  I sat down.
[2907.76 --> 2908.80]  The gentleman behind me was there.
[2908.86 --> 2912.52]  He was standing in line for a good 15 minutes, so I think it took a long time to, like, fix.
[2913.26 --> 2919.44]  But eventually he paid and left the cafe, and I got up, and the barista came up to me.
[2919.44 --> 2923.78]  He was like, actually, that guy just paid for all three of your drinks while you ate it.
[2925.58 --> 2930.38]  And I smiled a lot because I thought to myself, that was such a fun exchange that the two of us had.
[2930.46 --> 2935.76]  And it's actually a really good, albeit very small, example of the kind of thing we're going to talk about today.
[2935.84 --> 2938.16]  That brought a little bit of joy to my life.
[2938.16 --> 2944.78]  But this was a good example of what love can look like in the community in which we live.
[2944.88 --> 2947.60]  Love is the topic of our text today.
[2947.70 --> 2952.62]  And as we continue our sermon series through the book of Romans, we will be looking at that.
[2952.72 --> 2960.76]  Now, today's passage doesn't necessarily contain any, like, hot-button issues like we've been looking at the last couple of weeks.
[2960.76 --> 2964.26]  It's not a passage on religion and politics per se.
[2964.46 --> 2972.08]  It doesn't contain any specific verse or chunk of text in here that causes, like, theological debates in a lot of circles.
[2972.66 --> 2975.14]  Paul isn't stirring the pot here today, so to speak.
[2976.56 --> 2981.52]  And yet, these three verses we're going to look at today are massively important.
[2981.52 --> 2987.76]  They put a bow, they tie a bow, sort of, on what Paul has been talking about over these past couple chapters.
[2988.22 --> 2992.34]  And it gives a very clear and very direct application for us today.
[2992.40 --> 2995.84]  And my prayer is today that even though this passage might look a little simple on the surface,
[2996.34 --> 3001.24]  that the Holy Spirit uses it to speak some powerful truths into our lives this morning.
[3001.34 --> 3003.76]  So, if you have your Bibles, please open it up.
[3003.84 --> 3006.18]  There's a bunch of them in the back that you can grab as well.
[3006.52 --> 3010.40]  Or please turn your phone on and your Bible apps and get those open as well.
[3010.40 --> 3015.38]  We're going to be looking at Romans chapter 13, verses 8 to 10 this morning.
[3015.46 --> 3021.04]  And again, as always, I encourage you, please keep those Bibles open as we'll be diving in throughout the message.
[3021.60 --> 3024.36]  So, Romans 13, verses 8 to 10.
[3025.08 --> 3026.22]  They read like this.
[3027.22 --> 3034.64]  Let no debt remain outstanding except the continuing debt of love, or to love one another.
[3035.00 --> 3037.76]  For whoever loves others has fulfilled the law.
[3037.76 --> 3044.58]  The commandments, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not covet,
[3045.04 --> 3050.44]  and whatever other command there may be, are summed up in this one command.
[3051.26 --> 3053.08]  Love your neighbor as yourself.
[3054.20 --> 3056.04]  Love does no harm to a neighbor.
[3056.68 --> 3060.56]  Therefore, love is the fulfillment of the law.
[3061.32 --> 3062.90]  The word of the Lord.
[3062.90 --> 3070.92]  So, as we just read, this is a passage that focuses on love.
[3071.06 --> 3076.86]  In fact, I think the big idea that comes out of these verses is a fairly simple one to write down
[3076.86 --> 3079.44]  if you've got your notebooks and that's something you like to do.
[3081.18 --> 3084.60]  However, the big idea might be a little bit, while it's a little bit easy to write down,
[3084.64 --> 3087.32]  it might be a little bit harder to live out than we think.
[3087.32 --> 3089.04]  But the big idea is this.
[3090.12 --> 3093.80]  It is impossible to love others too much.
[3095.16 --> 3098.64]  It is impossible to love others too much.
[3099.80 --> 3103.50]  Now, this three-verse text repeatedly calls us to love.
[3103.74 --> 3104.44]  Take a look at it.
[3104.48 --> 3106.02]  Verse 8, love one another.
[3106.24 --> 3107.96]  Verse 8 again, love others.
[3108.08 --> 3109.96]  Verse 9, love your neighbor.
[3109.96 --> 3113.48]  It also then gives two instructions on how to love.
[3113.74 --> 3115.22]  Love does no harm to a neighbor.
[3115.60 --> 3118.90]  And again, in verse 10, love fulfills the law.
[3119.82 --> 3122.22]  But, what is love?
[3124.34 --> 3125.84]  Now, how many of you just sang the lyrics,
[3125.98 --> 3127.52]  baby, don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more, right?
[3127.58 --> 3128.44]  Yeah, I see hands.
[3128.58 --> 3129.44]  Put your hands up if you want.
[3129.48 --> 3131.36]  I mean, I did every single time I read over this sermon.
[3133.00 --> 3136.76]  Well, all five times love is mentioned in this text,
[3136.76 --> 3140.02]  there's one Greek word used, and that is agape.
[3140.24 --> 3141.50]  Now, for those of you in the know,
[3141.76 --> 3143.76]  this is the love that's commonly referred to
[3143.76 --> 3147.76]  to describe the kind of love that Jesus has for his church.
[3148.20 --> 3151.68]  It's an unconditional, self-sacrificing,
[3151.80 --> 3154.32]  all-encompassing kind of love,
[3154.38 --> 3157.40]  which I think oftentimes leaves us a little bit overwhelmed.
[3157.72 --> 3159.62]  It's perhaps a little hard to connect to that,
[3160.02 --> 3162.80]  but it can be defined in more tangible ways as well.
[3163.84 --> 3166.74]  All right, agape love is about valuing.
[3166.76 --> 3170.86]  Agape love holds others in high esteem.
[3171.98 --> 3176.14]  Agape love manifests or fuels a genuine
[3176.14 --> 3179.56]  and generous concern for those around them.
[3180.50 --> 3184.54]  Agape love is faithful towards those in our lives.
[3185.56 --> 3186.92]  So it's selfless, yes.
[3187.12 --> 3188.86]  It's unconditional, sure.
[3189.10 --> 3190.98]  It's all-encompassing, absolutely.
[3190.98 --> 3194.34]  But it's also simply seeing other people
[3194.34 --> 3197.30]  as worth your time,
[3198.30 --> 3199.38]  as worth your money,
[3199.84 --> 3201.62]  as worth your energy,
[3202.18 --> 3204.06]  as worth your efforts.
[3205.66 --> 3206.78]  And so, in short,
[3207.28 --> 3210.36]  it's seeing other people as worth your life.
[3210.36 --> 3215.36]  This love is giving of yourself
[3215.36 --> 3217.90]  because people are worth it,
[3218.14 --> 3220.58]  because people are valued.
[3221.94 --> 3224.36]  That's the love that this text is getting at.
[3224.36 --> 3232.86]  But, as a cocky expert of the law once asked Jesus,
[3233.62 --> 3235.52]  who exactly are we supposed to love?
[3236.36 --> 3239.08]  Who should be the recipient of this agape love?
[3239.96 --> 3242.68]  So when this expert asked Jesus this question,
[3243.20 --> 3245.88]  Jesus answered him with the parable of the Good Samaritan.
[3246.24 --> 3246.88]  Give it a read.
[3246.96 --> 3247.64]  It's super good.
[3247.74 --> 3249.44]  Luke 10, 25 to 37.
[3250.26 --> 3252.98]  Romans, though, answers this question for us.
[3253.50 --> 3255.46]  Romans has actually been answering this question
[3255.46 --> 3257.42]  for a good chunk of time now.
[3258.26 --> 3260.48]  See, time and time again throughout this letter,
[3260.92 --> 3262.44]  throughout this sermon series even,
[3262.54 --> 3264.18]  if you've had years to hear,
[3264.66 --> 3265.58]  Paul answers this.
[3265.82 --> 3267.30]  In previous weeks, we've heard this.
[3267.62 --> 3269.84]  Romans 13, 1 to 7, the last two weeks.
[3270.16 --> 3270.88]  Love your government.
[3272.00 --> 3272.72]  Love your leaders.
[3273.86 --> 3276.34]  Romans 12, 14 to 21, before that.
[3276.70 --> 3277.58]  Love your enemies.
[3278.62 --> 3280.56]  Love those who don't love you.
[3282.06 --> 3284.08]  Before that, Romans 12, 3 to 8.
[3284.36 --> 3285.10]  Love the church.
[3285.50 --> 3286.66]  Love the body of Christ.
[3286.84 --> 3288.10]  Love your brothers and sisters.
[3289.68 --> 3293.12]  And honestly, in just that chapter and a half,
[3293.28 --> 3295.78]  that kind of encompasses the whole spectrum, doesn't it?
[3296.40 --> 3297.68]  That covers the whole gauntlet.
[3298.32 --> 3299.80]  We're called to show this love
[3299.80 --> 3301.94]  to those we like and those we don't.
[3302.10 --> 3303.84]  To those who lead and those who serve.
[3304.12 --> 3306.70]  To those who love us back and to those who don't.
[3306.70 --> 3309.60]  To those who believe and to those who don't believe.
[3310.80 --> 3311.28]  Everyone.
[3312.56 --> 3315.80]  We are called to love everyone
[3315.80 --> 3317.98]  with this agape love.
[3318.22 --> 3319.42]  It is impossible
[3319.42 --> 3321.68]  to love others
[3321.68 --> 3322.86]  too much.
[3322.86 --> 3326.98]  Paul then, in this little chunk,
[3326.98 --> 3328.20]  he gives us a couple reasons
[3328.20 --> 3330.50]  why we are called to show this kind of love
[3330.50 --> 3330.96]  to everyone.
[3331.46 --> 3333.34]  First, Paul compares the love
[3333.34 --> 3334.20]  that we are to show
[3334.20 --> 3335.40]  to a debt
[3335.40 --> 3336.56]  that we cannot repay.
[3336.92 --> 3338.02]  Now, if you look at verse 8
[3338.02 --> 3338.62]  in your text,
[3338.62 --> 3339.60]  at first,
[3339.74 --> 3340.68]  this seems to be about
[3340.68 --> 3342.04]  paying back our loans.
[3342.28 --> 3343.32]  And in some ways,
[3343.42 --> 3344.24]  because it's coming out
[3344.24 --> 3345.38]  of the previous text
[3345.38 --> 3347.54]  on paying taxes
[3347.54 --> 3348.18]  or revenue
[3348.18 --> 3348.82]  or respect
[3348.82 --> 3349.24]  or honor,
[3349.32 --> 3350.10]  that does make sense.
[3350.28 --> 3351.24]  There is a link there.
[3352.22 --> 3354.32]  But I think what Paul is doing here
[3354.32 --> 3355.20]  is a little bit clever.
[3355.32 --> 3355.96]  He is saying
[3355.96 --> 3357.22]  that we are called
[3357.22 --> 3358.18]  to pay back
[3358.18 --> 3359.20]  our financial loans
[3359.20 --> 3360.00]  with integrity
[3360.00 --> 3361.00]  for sure.
[3361.80 --> 3362.12]  However,
[3362.20 --> 3363.32]  those financial debts,
[3363.42 --> 3364.20]  they've got a conclusion
[3364.20 --> 3364.74]  to them.
[3365.58 --> 3366.20]  Paul, in fact,
[3366.24 --> 3367.58]  is more cleverly pointing out
[3367.58 --> 3368.36]  that paying back
[3368.36 --> 3369.24]  the debt of love
[3369.24 --> 3370.12]  to the world
[3370.12 --> 3371.34]  is a debt
[3371.34 --> 3372.78]  that will be going on forever.
[3373.92 --> 3375.80]  It's an ongoing debt.
[3376.06 --> 3376.36]  It says,
[3376.72 --> 3378.46]  let no debt remain outstanding
[3378.46 --> 3381.22]  except for the continuing debt
[3381.22 --> 3381.82]  of love
[3381.82 --> 3382.80]  to one another.
[3384.14 --> 3384.60]  Or,
[3384.86 --> 3386.46]  as Eugene Peterson put it,
[3386.50 --> 3387.74]  you know Eugene Peterson, right?
[3388.02 --> 3388.36]  He's the guy
[3388.36 --> 3388.98]  that wrote the Bible.
[3390.10 --> 3391.72]  He translated
[3391.72 --> 3393.46]  into one version
[3393.46 --> 3394.14]  of the Bible
[3394.14 --> 3394.78]  called The Message.
[3395.26 --> 3395.96]  But he says this.
[3396.00 --> 3396.50]  He says this.
[3396.68 --> 3397.74]  He writes it pretty decently.
[3397.84 --> 3398.06]  He says,
[3398.14 --> 3398.86]  don't run up debts
[3398.86 --> 3401.02]  except for the huge debt
[3401.02 --> 3401.68]  of love
[3401.68 --> 3402.80]  you owe to one another
[3402.80 --> 3404.28]  or that you owe
[3404.28 --> 3404.94]  to each other.
[3406.20 --> 3407.14]  There is a debt
[3407.14 --> 3408.20]  that will never be settled
[3408.20 --> 3409.00]  and that is the debt
[3409.00 --> 3409.88]  of love to others.
[3410.04 --> 3412.02]  If we can go way back
[3412.02 --> 3413.02]  and Greek out again
[3413.02 --> 3413.78]  just for one minute,
[3413.88 --> 3414.60]  the Greek language
[3414.60 --> 3415.94]  highlights this very clearly.
[3416.06 --> 3416.84]  The original audience
[3416.84 --> 3417.60]  would have got this
[3417.60 --> 3418.22]  right away
[3418.22 --> 3419.36]  because the word
[3419.36 --> 3420.10]  that starts out
[3420.10 --> 3421.08]  verse 8 is oh
[3421.08 --> 3422.48]  as in oh nothing.
[3422.48 --> 3423.52]  We translate that
[3423.52 --> 3425.28]  as to let no debt remain
[3425.28 --> 3426.18]  but in Greek it says
[3426.18 --> 3426.86]  owe nothing
[3426.86 --> 3429.42]  but that verb to owe
[3429.42 --> 3430.46]  or aphilio
[3430.46 --> 3432.30]  is in the present imperative
[3432.30 --> 3434.56]  which is just a super smart way
[3434.56 --> 3436.98]  of saying that this is a constant
[3436.98 --> 3439.42]  and continuous owing.
[3440.02 --> 3442.86]  This is a never ending owing.
[3442.96 --> 3443.38]  In other words,
[3443.46 --> 3444.00]  the Greek here
[3444.00 --> 3444.94]  is literally saying
[3444.94 --> 3446.58]  owe nothing to anyone
[3446.58 --> 3449.80]  except keep on owing love
[3449.80 --> 3451.92]  to one another always.
[3452.58 --> 3454.18]  Keep on owing on.
[3454.30 --> 3455.46]  There's your t-shirt slogan.
[3455.92 --> 3457.22]  Keep on loving.
[3457.98 --> 3458.38]  Always.
[3458.66 --> 3459.36]  Never stop.
[3460.76 --> 3461.54]  In this way,
[3461.64 --> 3463.56]  Paul is urging the reader
[3463.56 --> 3464.92]  to see that love
[3464.92 --> 3466.22]  is the only thing
[3466.22 --> 3467.98]  that we cannot pay back.
[3468.62 --> 3469.88]  It is a debt of love
[3469.88 --> 3471.30]  that will always exist.
[3471.48 --> 3473.44]  We cannot love too much.
[3473.44 --> 3478.38]  John A.T. Robinson,
[3478.62 --> 3480.30]  he's a New Testament scholar.
[3480.74 --> 3481.96]  He was, sorry,
[3482.04 --> 3482.86]  a New Testament scholar
[3482.86 --> 3483.84]  and an Anglican bishop
[3483.84 --> 3485.14]  in the mid-1900s.
[3485.30 --> 3486.02]  He says this
[3486.02 --> 3486.96]  about the debt of love
[3486.96 --> 3488.16]  that Paul is writing about here.
[3488.22 --> 3488.56]  He says,
[3488.56 --> 3490.32]  We may pay our taxes
[3490.32 --> 3491.10]  and be quit.
[3492.10 --> 3493.54]  We may give respect
[3493.54 --> 3494.06]  and honor
[3494.06 --> 3494.82]  where they are due
[3494.82 --> 3496.56]  and have no further obligation.
[3497.52 --> 3499.18]  But we can never say
[3499.18 --> 3500.00]  I have done
[3500.00 --> 3501.06]  all of the loving
[3501.06 --> 3502.04]  I need to do.
[3503.16 --> 3504.88]  Love is a permanent obligation,
[3505.08 --> 3506.56]  a debt impossible
[3506.56 --> 3507.30]  to discharge.
[3508.56 --> 3511.28]  We cannot love too much.
[3513.26 --> 3514.90]  We can never stop loving.
[3514.98 --> 3515.84]  The box can never
[3515.84 --> 3516.62]  be fully checked.
[3516.74 --> 3518.22]  Love is a permanent obligation.
[3518.22 --> 3520.20]  Love must undergird
[3520.20 --> 3521.80]  everything we do,
[3522.16 --> 3523.32]  everything we say,
[3523.48 --> 3524.86]  every decision we make.
[3525.12 --> 3526.96]  We constantly owe love
[3526.96 --> 3527.72]  to one another
[3527.72 --> 3528.66]  because God,
[3528.96 --> 3530.22]  who is love,
[3530.60 --> 3531.30]  calls us
[3531.30 --> 3533.68]  to live our lives of love.
[3533.94 --> 3536.88]  We cannot love too much.
[3538.96 --> 3540.48]  Love is the heartbeat
[3540.48 --> 3542.00]  of everything we do,
[3542.50 --> 3544.00]  whether it's paying taxes
[3544.00 --> 3545.28]  or playing baseball,
[3545.76 --> 3546.10]  cooking,
[3546.46 --> 3546.80]  gardening,
[3547.10 --> 3547.46]  building,
[3547.46 --> 3548.10]  working,
[3548.10 --> 3548.14]  working,
[3548.38 --> 3548.90]  researching,
[3549.32 --> 3550.28]  attending meetings,
[3550.46 --> 3551.18]  vacationing,
[3551.40 --> 3552.16]  fill in the blank
[3552.16 --> 3553.12]  with whatever verb
[3553.12 --> 3554.00]  you want to do
[3554.00 --> 3555.00]  or whatever verb
[3555.00 --> 3556.28]  you find yourself doing
[3556.28 --> 3557.30]  throughout the week.
[3558.36 --> 3559.34]  All of that
[3559.34 --> 3560.72]  we are called to do
[3560.72 --> 3561.62]  with love
[3561.62 --> 3562.58]  to those who you happen
[3562.58 --> 3563.16]  to be with
[3563.16 --> 3564.72]  because the debt of love
[3564.72 --> 3565.28]  is one
[3565.28 --> 3567.34]  that we are forever repaying.
[3568.14 --> 3568.88]  We cannot
[3568.88 --> 3570.38]  love
[3570.38 --> 3571.50]  too much.
[3571.50 --> 3574.74]  so first of all,
[3574.98 --> 3577.12]  we love one another
[3577.12 --> 3578.54]  because the debt of love
[3578.54 --> 3579.42]  is ongoing.
[3581.78 --> 3583.10]  The second reason
[3583.10 --> 3584.46]  that Paul gives us
[3584.46 --> 3585.28]  to keep on loving
[3585.28 --> 3585.84]  one another
[3585.84 --> 3587.08]  is because love
[3587.08 --> 3588.78]  fulfills the law.
[3590.22 --> 3591.56]  In both verse 8
[3591.56 --> 3592.38]  and verse 10
[3592.38 --> 3593.24]  of our text,
[3593.74 --> 3594.62]  Paul makes this clear.
[3595.12 --> 3595.64]  In verse 8,
[3595.72 --> 3596.14]  he says,
[3596.46 --> 3597.62]  whoever loves others
[3597.62 --> 3598.76]  has fulfilled the law.
[3598.76 --> 3600.02]  And then in verse 10,
[3600.10 --> 3601.24]  the very last eight words
[3601.24 --> 3602.12]  of our text today,
[3602.68 --> 3603.06]  it says,
[3603.42 --> 3603.60]  therefore,
[3603.96 --> 3604.44]  in other words,
[3604.54 --> 3605.22]  summing up everything
[3605.22 --> 3606.22]  we've just talked about,
[3606.60 --> 3606.92]  therefore,
[3607.72 --> 3609.24]  love is the fulfillment
[3609.24 --> 3610.26]  of the law.
[3611.40 --> 3612.22]  Now this is important
[3612.22 --> 3612.64]  because
[3612.64 --> 3615.50]  I think sometimes
[3615.50 --> 3618.34]  we draw a line
[3618.34 --> 3619.46]  between love and law.
[3620.56 --> 3622.20]  We think love and law
[3622.20 --> 3622.82]  are enemies.
[3622.82 --> 3626.48]  We think truth,
[3626.80 --> 3627.26]  obedience,
[3627.98 --> 3629.10]  and law
[3629.10 --> 3630.82]  fit in one category.
[3631.78 --> 3633.12]  And then grace
[3633.12 --> 3633.80]  and mercy
[3633.80 --> 3634.58]  and love
[3634.58 --> 3636.18]  fit in a different category.
[3637.78 --> 3639.02]  Now this polarity
[3639.02 --> 3639.58]  is obviously
[3639.58 --> 3640.44]  very divisive
[3640.44 --> 3641.18]  and it oftentimes
[3641.18 --> 3642.68]  divides Christians
[3642.68 --> 3644.22]  into two camps.
[3645.10 --> 3646.62]  To make this political again
[3646.62 --> 3647.42]  because this passage
[3647.42 --> 3648.18]  is still connecting
[3648.18 --> 3649.18]  to the one on government,
[3649.18 --> 3651.96]  this separation
[3651.96 --> 3653.00]  of law and love
[3653.00 --> 3654.74]  often misleads people
[3654.74 --> 3656.66]  by saying
[3656.66 --> 3657.12]  you're either
[3657.12 --> 3657.88]  in the loving,
[3658.42 --> 3659.14]  liberal left
[3659.14 --> 3662.46]  or the lawful,
[3663.02 --> 3663.88]  conservative right.
[3664.86 --> 3667.16]  Which simply corrupts
[3667.16 --> 3667.70]  the reality
[3667.70 --> 3669.10]  that you cannot separate
[3669.10 --> 3670.28]  these two things together.
[3670.40 --> 3671.38]  You cannot separate
[3671.38 --> 3672.50]  law and love.
[3673.28 --> 3673.62]  You see,
[3674.02 --> 3674.74]  love and law
[3674.74 --> 3675.64]  are not enemies.
[3676.70 --> 3677.62]  They are united
[3677.62 --> 3678.64]  by their relationship
[3678.64 --> 3679.42]  in Jesus Christ.
[3679.50 --> 3681.22]  Jesus came into this world
[3681.22 --> 3682.10]  full of grace
[3682.10 --> 3682.84]  and truth.
[3683.50 --> 3684.40]  He came into this world
[3684.40 --> 3685.20]  full of law
[3685.20 --> 3686.24]  and love.
[3686.34 --> 3687.06]  He fulfilled
[3687.06 --> 3688.58]  the law of love
[3688.58 --> 3689.96]  and he invites us
[3689.96 --> 3690.82]  to do the same.
[3691.14 --> 3691.38]  Again,
[3691.44 --> 3692.26]  that's what the greatest
[3692.26 --> 3693.04]  commandment is
[3693.04 --> 3694.22]  when Jesus was asked this.
[3694.56 --> 3695.24]  We are to love.
[3695.34 --> 3695.90]  Love the Lord,
[3696.04 --> 3696.74]  love your neighbor.
[3697.56 --> 3698.38]  Matthew 23,
[3698.52 --> 3699.32]  37 to 40.
[3700.88 --> 3701.80]  Without Jesus,
[3703.12 --> 3704.22]  the law
[3704.22 --> 3705.02]  is powerless.
[3705.02 --> 3707.70]  But without Jesus,
[3708.22 --> 3710.00]  love is directionless.
[3712.52 --> 3713.52]  When you love,
[3713.60 --> 3714.70]  you fulfill the law.
[3714.98 --> 3716.94]  Law is against sin.
[3717.52 --> 3719.66]  It is not against love.
[3721.12 --> 3721.78]  Let me say that again.
[3721.92 --> 3723.52]  Law is against sin.
[3723.74 --> 3725.12]  It is not against love.
[3726.00 --> 3726.12]  So,
[3726.84 --> 3727.60]  love and law
[3727.60 --> 3728.26]  are not enemies.
[3728.42 --> 3729.40]  They work together
[3729.40 --> 3730.20]  for the betterment
[3730.20 --> 3731.24]  of the body of Christ.
[3731.34 --> 3732.70]  They work together
[3732.70 --> 3733.48]  for the betterment
[3733.48 --> 3734.16]  of the communities
[3734.16 --> 3735.74]  in which we find ourselves in.
[3736.88 --> 3737.96]  But then the question becomes,
[3738.08 --> 3738.46]  what does this
[3738.46 --> 3739.54]  tangibly look like?
[3741.00 --> 3741.94]  How are love
[3741.94 --> 3742.92]  and law united
[3742.92 --> 3744.02]  and how does that work
[3744.02 --> 3744.74]  in our lives?
[3744.82 --> 3744.96]  Well,
[3745.36 --> 3746.44]  Paul gives us examples
[3746.44 --> 3747.66]  of this in our text.
[3747.74 --> 3748.54]  In verse 9,
[3749.02 --> 3749.78]  Paul goes back
[3749.78 --> 3750.34]  and he lists
[3750.34 --> 3752.08]  some of the commands
[3752.08 --> 3753.78]  that can only be followed
[3753.78 --> 3754.46]  when we love.
[3755.92 --> 3757.30]  He speaks of adultery,
[3757.80 --> 3758.12]  murder,
[3758.54 --> 3758.90]  stealing,
[3759.36 --> 3760.48]  and covetousness.
[3760.48 --> 3764.06]  These are all commands,
[3764.18 --> 3764.40]  of course,
[3764.46 --> 3765.22]  that are given way back
[3765.22 --> 3766.04]  in Exodus 20
[3766.04 --> 3767.34]  in the Ten Commandments
[3767.34 --> 3768.22]  to the people of Israel.
[3770.38 --> 3770.78]  However,
[3770.98 --> 3771.78]  in Exodus 20,
[3771.86 --> 3772.78]  these commands are written
[3772.78 --> 3773.38]  in the negative,
[3773.80 --> 3774.82]  just like they are here
[3774.82 --> 3775.52]  in Paul's letter.
[3775.94 --> 3776.08]  Right?
[3776.14 --> 3776.58]  They're all written,
[3776.68 --> 3778.20]  thou shalt not commit adultery,
[3778.30 --> 3779.50]  thou shalt not murder,
[3779.84 --> 3780.96]  thou shalt not steal,
[3781.36 --> 3782.40]  thou shalt not covet.
[3783.30 --> 3783.72]  So,
[3783.80 --> 3784.56]  these commands are written
[3784.56 --> 3785.34]  as don'ts.
[3786.26 --> 3787.86]  But what do these look like
[3787.86 --> 3789.30]  if they're written as do's?
[3790.70 --> 3791.02]  You see,
[3791.06 --> 3791.62]  all these commands
[3791.62 --> 3792.38]  can be written
[3792.38 --> 3793.12]  in the positive.
[3794.16 --> 3795.42]  And the easiest way
[3795.42 --> 3795.94]  to do that
[3795.94 --> 3796.98]  is to ask ourselves,
[3797.30 --> 3799.38]  if I was to love the other,
[3799.72 --> 3800.96]  what does this command say?
[3803.56 --> 3804.00]  Now,
[3804.06 --> 3805.04]  this is not my thinking.
[3805.26 --> 3806.18]  The Heidelberg Catechism
[3806.18 --> 3807.10]  does this for us.
[3807.16 --> 3808.02]  The Heidelberg Catechism
[3808.02 --> 3809.20]  is this confessional document
[3809.20 --> 3810.12]  which uses scripture
[3810.12 --> 3811.42]  to back up
[3811.42 --> 3811.90]  and answer
[3811.90 --> 3813.10]  some of the big questions
[3813.10 --> 3813.60]  of faith,
[3813.66 --> 3815.04]  and they do this for us.
[3815.44 --> 3815.72]  So,
[3815.82 --> 3816.46]  let's quickly look
[3816.46 --> 3817.42]  at these four commands.
[3817.86 --> 3818.86]  That Paul lists here
[3818.86 --> 3820.36]  and see how they can be rewritten
[3820.36 --> 3822.00]  to speak in the positive.
[3822.16 --> 3823.28]  See how they can be written
[3823.28 --> 3825.30]  through the lens of love.
[3825.96 --> 3826.26]  So,
[3826.32 --> 3827.36]  when thinking of adultery,
[3828.28 --> 3829.50]  for the married person,
[3829.64 --> 3830.70]  following this command
[3830.70 --> 3832.06]  means not only
[3832.06 --> 3832.68]  that you refuse
[3832.68 --> 3833.66]  to cheat on your spouse,
[3834.78 --> 3836.46]  but that you're constantly
[3836.46 --> 3837.80]  looking for ways
[3837.80 --> 3839.44]  to serve and care for them
[3839.44 --> 3840.02]  in their everyday.
[3841.38 --> 3842.12]  That's what
[3842.12 --> 3843.30]  not committing adultery
[3843.30 --> 3843.80]  looks like
[3843.80 --> 3844.86]  when we love that person.
[3845.84 --> 3847.12]  When thinking about murder,
[3847.12 --> 3847.88]  following this command
[3847.88 --> 3848.78]  means not only
[3848.78 --> 3849.34]  that you refuse
[3849.34 --> 3850.16]  to kill people,
[3851.12 --> 3852.36]  but also that
[3852.36 --> 3853.28]  you would be loving
[3853.28 --> 3854.22]  towards those
[3854.22 --> 3854.90]  who you dislike,
[3854.98 --> 3855.70]  to be patient,
[3856.12 --> 3857.36]  to be peace-bearing,
[3857.72 --> 3858.52]  to be gentle
[3858.52 --> 3859.34]  and merciful
[3859.34 --> 3860.44]  and friendly
[3860.44 --> 3861.14]  towards them.
[3861.26 --> 3861.88]  We're called
[3861.88 --> 3863.08]  to do good
[3863.08 --> 3864.78]  in this command.
[3865.64 --> 3866.94]  When thinking about theft,
[3867.50 --> 3868.22]  following this command
[3868.22 --> 3869.26]  is more than simply
[3869.26 --> 3871.30]  refusing to take things
[3871.30 --> 3872.54]  that don't belong to us,
[3872.54 --> 3874.34]  but it's actually
[3874.34 --> 3875.40]  actively giving
[3875.40 --> 3876.32]  of the things
[3876.32 --> 3877.76]  that we do possess
[3877.76 --> 3879.16]  to give to others,
[3879.16 --> 3879.88]  our money,
[3880.00 --> 3880.50]  our possessions,
[3880.64 --> 3881.00]  our time,
[3881.06 --> 3881.52]  our energy,
[3881.52 --> 3883.60]  so that others
[3883.60 --> 3885.48]  whom we love
[3885.48 --> 3886.64]  are blessed
[3886.64 --> 3887.62]  by the very gifts
[3887.62 --> 3888.66]  that God has entrusted
[3888.66 --> 3889.24]  to us.
[3890.58 --> 3891.50]  That's why Paul talks
[3891.50 --> 3892.50]  about paying our taxes
[3892.50 --> 3893.16]  and tithing
[3893.16 --> 3893.64]  and serving
[3893.64 --> 3894.60]  and giving of yourself.
[3894.70 --> 3895.80]  That's how you love
[3895.80 --> 3897.42]  with this command.
[3898.00 --> 3898.52]  And then finally,
[3898.62 --> 3899.28]  covetousness.
[3899.70 --> 3900.46]  Following this command
[3900.46 --> 3901.12]  is not simply
[3901.12 --> 3902.78]  refusing to desire
[3902.78 --> 3903.92]  what other people possess,
[3904.50 --> 3904.76]  which,
[3905.28 --> 3906.00]  just real quick,
[3906.08 --> 3906.80]  is something that
[3906.80 --> 3908.00]  is just rampant
[3908.00 --> 3908.48]  right now
[3908.48 --> 3909.30]  in our culture
[3909.30 --> 3910.82]  with the highlight clips
[3910.82 --> 3911.58]  that we get to see
[3911.58 --> 3912.30]  each and every day
[3912.30 --> 3913.26]  on the social medias.
[3914.06 --> 3914.40]  But no,
[3914.90 --> 3915.96]  following this exam
[3915.96 --> 3916.90]  or following this command,
[3916.98 --> 3917.08]  sorry,
[3917.12 --> 3918.20]  is not simply refusing
[3918.20 --> 3918.92]  to desire
[3918.92 --> 3920.08]  what other people possess,
[3921.08 --> 3921.48]  but it means
[3921.48 --> 3923.12]  actively celebrating
[3923.12 --> 3923.78]  with people
[3923.78 --> 3924.84]  who have accomplished
[3924.84 --> 3925.96]  things and received
[3925.96 --> 3926.80]  things that God
[3926.80 --> 3927.50]  has given them,
[3927.80 --> 3928.80]  that God has entrusted
[3928.80 --> 3929.76]  them to steward well.
[3931.42 --> 3932.14]  And so that means
[3932.14 --> 3933.00]  for us as a body,
[3933.08 --> 3934.70]  for us as church members,
[3935.02 --> 3936.42]  that following this law
[3936.42 --> 3937.76]  of love,
[3937.80 --> 3938.64]  it means more than
[3938.64 --> 3940.60]  simply refusing
[3940.60 --> 3942.06]  to actively sin
[3942.06 --> 3942.96]  against your brothers
[3942.96 --> 3944.10]  and sisters in Christ,
[3945.10 --> 3946.34]  but they were actually
[3946.34 --> 3946.96]  actively,
[3947.20 --> 3947.74]  purposely
[3947.74 --> 3950.00]  looking for ways
[3950.00 --> 3950.96]  in which we can bless
[3950.96 --> 3952.20]  and serve each other,
[3952.38 --> 3953.20]  which we can bless
[3953.20 --> 3954.18]  and serve everyone
[3954.18 --> 3954.98]  in this body,
[3955.02 --> 3956.06]  not just those
[3956.06 --> 3956.70]  that you know
[3956.70 --> 3957.30]  or those that are
[3957.30 --> 3958.36]  the same age as you
[3958.36 --> 3959.32]  or those that are
[3959.32 --> 3960.30]  into the same things
[3960.30 --> 3960.70]  as you
[3960.70 --> 3961.32]  or who are
[3961.32 --> 3962.12]  in the same circles
[3962.12 --> 3962.64]  as you,
[3962.78 --> 3963.80]  but everyone,
[3964.58 --> 3965.48]  that we are actively
[3965.48 --> 3966.32]  and purposefully
[3966.32 --> 3967.28]  looking for ways
[3967.28 --> 3968.28]  to serve each other.
[3969.50 --> 3970.58]  That is how we show
[3970.58 --> 3971.48]  love in these commands.
[3971.48 --> 3976.80]  Now, there's one last thing.
[3977.84 --> 3978.50]  We're going to look
[3978.50 --> 3979.48]  at verse 10 there
[3979.48 --> 3980.40]  with me for a second
[3980.40 --> 3982.40]  because there's one more
[3982.40 --> 3983.54]  thing to highlight there.
[3983.64 --> 3984.46]  Verse 10 says this.
[3984.52 --> 3984.78]  It says,
[3984.94 --> 3985.96]  love does no harm
[3985.96 --> 3986.54]  to a neighbor.
[3986.82 --> 3987.16]  Therefore,
[3987.42 --> 3988.78]  love is the fulfillment
[3988.78 --> 3989.50]  of the law.
[3991.30 --> 3992.16]  Now, there's something
[3992.16 --> 3993.08]  worth quickly pointing
[3993.08 --> 3993.64]  out here
[3993.64 --> 3994.80]  because it is easy
[3994.80 --> 3995.72]  for us to read
[3995.72 --> 3996.76]  our own culture
[3996.76 --> 3997.44]  and context
[3997.44 --> 3998.40]  into this verse.
[3998.40 --> 3999.92]  See, in our culture,
[4000.78 --> 4002.40]  the idea of do no harm
[4002.40 --> 4003.62]  has become a bit
[4003.62 --> 4004.42]  of a buzzy saying.
[4004.96 --> 4005.60]  And I think
[4005.60 --> 4007.12]  the majority of the time,
[4007.16 --> 4007.70]  and I mean this,
[4007.78 --> 4009.00]  the majority of the time,
[4009.04 --> 4010.18]  it is a very good thing.
[4010.76 --> 4011.32]  I mean, after all,
[4011.34 --> 4012.36]  Paul is saying it here.
[4012.84 --> 4013.46]  Paul is saying here
[4013.46 --> 4014.66]  that love does no harm
[4014.66 --> 4015.18]  to a neighbor.
[4016.64 --> 4017.04]  However,
[4017.14 --> 4017.90]  what has happened
[4017.90 --> 4018.46]  a little bit
[4018.46 --> 4019.06]  in our culture
[4019.06 --> 4020.00]  is sometimes
[4020.00 --> 4020.66]  this plucky
[4020.66 --> 4021.96]  do no harm slogan
[4021.96 --> 4023.00]  gets stretched
[4023.00 --> 4023.62]  a little further
[4023.62 --> 4024.86]  than Paul is intending here.
[4025.82 --> 4026.62]  Now, it's important
[4026.62 --> 4027.74]  to know in Paul's letter here
[4027.74 --> 4028.44]  that this line,
[4028.54 --> 4029.32]  this whole verse 10,
[4029.44 --> 4029.80]  actually,
[4030.16 --> 4031.66]  is written in Greek
[4031.66 --> 4032.54]  very poetically.
[4033.16 --> 4035.08]  It's written as a chiasm,
[4035.20 --> 4035.76]  but unfortunately,
[4035.90 --> 4036.60]  that gets lost
[4036.60 --> 4037.50]  in the English.
[4038.00 --> 4038.80]  It still carries
[4038.80 --> 4039.48]  some authority.
[4039.94 --> 4040.74]  Love does no harm
[4040.74 --> 4041.24]  to a neighbor.
[4041.36 --> 4041.62]  Therefore,
[4041.76 --> 4042.58]  love is the fulfillment
[4042.58 --> 4043.26]  of the law.
[4043.60 --> 4044.44]  But the poetry
[4044.44 --> 4045.46]  and the artistry
[4045.46 --> 4046.60]  is missing.
[4046.84 --> 4048.12]  It's lost in the English.
[4048.60 --> 4049.22]  And one thing
[4049.22 --> 4050.32]  that gets missed here
[4050.32 --> 4052.18]  is that when Paul says
[4052.18 --> 4053.76]  love does no harm,
[4053.86 --> 4054.40]  he is saying
[4054.40 --> 4055.84]  love does no evil.
[4056.62 --> 4057.54]  The word here
[4057.54 --> 4058.60]  is kakos,
[4059.10 --> 4060.24]  which means evilness
[4060.24 --> 4061.02]  or wickedness
[4061.02 --> 4062.38]  or a perversion
[4062.38 --> 4063.22]  of what is right.
[4064.52 --> 4064.88]  And I think
[4064.88 --> 4066.18]  what needs highlighting today
[4066.18 --> 4067.26]  is that oftentimes
[4067.26 --> 4068.28]  our culture pushes
[4068.28 --> 4070.06]  this do no harm narrative
[4070.06 --> 4071.70]  just too far,
[4071.80 --> 4072.50]  a little too far.
[4072.78 --> 4074.04]  It's turned into a phrase
[4074.04 --> 4075.26]  that can become
[4075.26 --> 4076.54]  very individualistic.
[4077.26 --> 4077.50]  Like,
[4077.58 --> 4078.94]  I can do whatever I want
[4078.94 --> 4081.14]  unless it causes
[4081.14 --> 4081.70]  someone harm.
[4081.70 --> 4083.22]  or perhaps
[4083.22 --> 4083.94]  making it
[4083.94 --> 4085.32]  receptive,
[4085.80 --> 4087.00]  you can't tell me
[4087.00 --> 4088.36]  how to live my life
[4088.36 --> 4089.70]  because what you're saying
[4089.70 --> 4090.46]  offends me
[4090.46 --> 4091.64]  or causes me harm.
[4092.40 --> 4093.50]  But if the reality
[4093.50 --> 4094.12]  is
[4094.12 --> 4095.98]  that law is love
[4095.98 --> 4097.26]  and love is law,
[4098.32 --> 4099.30]  sometimes
[4099.30 --> 4101.28]  in order to love someone,
[4101.68 --> 4103.40]  we may need
[4103.40 --> 4104.02]  to risk
[4104.02 --> 4104.96]  offending them.
[4105.30 --> 4106.30]  That's different
[4106.30 --> 4107.32]  than the harm
[4107.32 --> 4107.86]  that Paul
[4107.86 --> 4108.98]  is speaking about.
[4108.98 --> 4109.24]  Now,
[4109.66 --> 4110.32]  please,
[4110.80 --> 4111.28]  please,
[4111.42 --> 4111.96]  please
[4111.96 --> 4113.38]  be careful
[4113.38 --> 4115.06]  with this instruction.
[4116.94 --> 4118.30]  There are two things
[4118.30 --> 4119.48]  that are particularly
[4119.48 --> 4120.20]  important.
[4121.54 --> 4122.08]  And oftentimes
[4122.08 --> 4123.22]  we really need to hear
[4123.22 --> 4124.46]  one of these two things.
[4126.38 --> 4127.42]  Holding people
[4127.42 --> 4127.96]  accountable
[4127.96 --> 4128.88]  for their sin
[4128.88 --> 4130.92]  is not an excuse
[4130.92 --> 4131.72]  for us to be
[4131.72 --> 4132.34]  tactless
[4132.34 --> 4133.32]  and crass
[4133.32 --> 4134.48]  when we engage people
[4134.48 --> 4135.06]  about the way
[4135.06 --> 4135.70]  they may be living
[4135.70 --> 4136.24]  their lives.
[4137.24 --> 4137.92]  So just because
[4137.92 --> 4138.90]  truths need to be
[4138.90 --> 4139.20]  said,
[4139.60 --> 4140.28]  they still need
[4140.28 --> 4140.70]  to be said
[4140.70 --> 4141.22]  with love.
[4142.12 --> 4142.80]  They still need
[4142.80 --> 4143.16]  to be said
[4143.16 --> 4143.86]  with patience
[4143.86 --> 4144.72]  and kindness
[4144.72 --> 4145.60]  and humility
[4145.60 --> 4146.70]  and gentleness.
[4146.96 --> 4149.24]  This love is law
[4149.24 --> 4150.06]  that Paul
[4150.06 --> 4150.92]  is getting at here
[4150.92 --> 4152.36]  is not carte blanche
[4152.36 --> 4152.94]  for us
[4152.94 --> 4153.90]  to say whatever
[4153.90 --> 4154.54]  you want,
[4154.88 --> 4155.80]  however you want,
[4156.10 --> 4157.16]  as if the truth
[4157.16 --> 4158.04]  of the situation
[4158.04 --> 4159.10]  supersedes
[4159.10 --> 4160.24]  the lack of self-control
[4160.24 --> 4161.26]  that we might possess
[4161.26 --> 4162.62]  to converse properly.
[4164.20 --> 4164.72]  Again,
[4164.84 --> 4165.78]  love is still patient.
[4166.30 --> 4167.26]  It is still kind.
[4167.40 --> 4168.26]  It is still gentle.
[4168.26 --> 4170.30]  Read 1 Corinthians 13.
[4170.98 --> 4172.26]  Love is all of those things
[4172.26 --> 4173.34]  in those conversations.
[4175.00 --> 4175.56]  However,
[4176.56 --> 4178.64]  it also means
[4178.64 --> 4179.22]  that if someone
[4179.22 --> 4179.82]  who claims
[4179.82 --> 4180.48]  to love the Lord
[4180.48 --> 4181.28]  is living outside
[4181.28 --> 4182.16]  of the parameters
[4182.16 --> 4184.06]  of God's bar
[4184.06 --> 4184.74]  of holiness,
[4185.40 --> 4186.62]  if they are willfully
[4186.62 --> 4187.68]  disobeying
[4187.68 --> 4188.88]  the order
[4188.88 --> 4189.44]  and commands
[4189.44 --> 4190.14]  that God has placed
[4190.14 --> 4191.00]  on all of us,
[4191.00 --> 4193.36]  in order to love them,
[4194.00 --> 4196.04]  we may need
[4196.04 --> 4196.92]  to call them out
[4196.92 --> 4198.10]  on their sin
[4198.10 --> 4198.64]  and risk
[4198.64 --> 4199.44]  offending them.
[4201.12 --> 4201.84]  Our culture
[4201.84 --> 4202.56]  can oftentimes
[4202.56 --> 4203.76]  deem that
[4203.76 --> 4204.70]  as harmful behavior,
[4204.82 --> 4205.46]  but that is not
[4205.46 --> 4206.28]  the kind of harm
[4206.28 --> 4206.62]  that Paul
[4206.62 --> 4207.62]  is referring to here.
[4208.40 --> 4209.68]  Love does no harm
[4209.68 --> 4210.44]  to a neighbor
[4210.44 --> 4212.42]  because love
[4212.42 --> 4213.54]  is the fulfillment
[4213.54 --> 4215.06]  of the law.
[4215.06 --> 4217.74]  I pray that you
[4217.74 --> 4218.66]  see the difference there
[4218.66 --> 4219.46]  and I pray that you
[4219.46 --> 4220.26]  simply don't side
[4220.26 --> 4221.02]  with the one side
[4221.02 --> 4221.98]  that you agree with more,
[4222.22 --> 4222.60]  but you actually
[4222.60 --> 4223.32]  look into your heart
[4223.32 --> 4223.66]  and you see,
[4224.00 --> 4224.62]  how is God
[4224.62 --> 4225.42]  calling me
[4225.42 --> 4226.28]  to love
[4226.28 --> 4227.16]  my neighbor?
[4228.72 --> 4229.50]  How is God
[4229.50 --> 4230.08]  calling me
[4230.08 --> 4230.72]  to love
[4230.72 --> 4231.32]  those
[4231.32 --> 4232.56]  around me?
[4232.56 --> 4236.58]  And so,
[4236.72 --> 4237.26]  we are called
[4237.26 --> 4238.44]  to a selfless,
[4238.92 --> 4239.68]  unconditional,
[4240.20 --> 4241.74]  all-encompassing love
[4241.74 --> 4243.28]  worthy of our time,
[4243.58 --> 4244.30]  our money,
[4244.60 --> 4245.44]  our energy,
[4245.68 --> 4246.22]  our efforts,
[4246.32 --> 4246.64]  and really
[4246.64 --> 4247.58]  all of our lives
[4247.58 --> 4248.54]  because people
[4248.54 --> 4249.34]  are worth it.
[4249.42 --> 4250.60]  People are valued
[4250.60 --> 4251.64]  and we are not just
[4251.64 --> 4253.06]  to show
[4253.06 --> 4255.62]  this high calling
[4255.62 --> 4256.02]  of love
[4256.02 --> 4256.84]  to our friends
[4256.84 --> 4257.48]  and families
[4257.48 --> 4258.04]  and care groups,
[4258.14 --> 4258.88]  but we're also called
[4258.88 --> 4259.50]  to show this
[4259.50 --> 4260.88]  high calling
[4260.88 --> 4261.46]  of love
[4261.46 --> 4262.42]  to our government
[4262.42 --> 4262.82]  leaders,
[4263.14 --> 4263.70]  our enemies,
[4264.18 --> 4264.66]  the homeless
[4264.66 --> 4265.44]  on our streets,
[4265.72 --> 4266.42]  the fellow church
[4266.42 --> 4266.72]  growers,
[4266.86 --> 4267.38]  no matter what
[4267.38 --> 4267.92]  disagreements
[4267.92 --> 4268.52]  we may have
[4268.52 --> 4268.92]  with them,
[4269.72 --> 4271.40]  and if you're
[4271.40 --> 4272.16]  sitting there
[4272.16 --> 4273.36]  thinking,
[4274.34 --> 4274.92]  jeepers,
[4275.30 --> 4276.20]  that is a lot,
[4277.50 --> 4277.82]  yeah,
[4279.18 --> 4280.18]  you're tracking
[4280.18 --> 4281.04]  with this perfectly.
[4281.20 --> 4282.58]  This is a very
[4282.58 --> 4284.26]  overwhelming call
[4284.26 --> 4286.64]  and this is,
[4286.80 --> 4287.44]  by all intents
[4287.44 --> 4288.04]  and purposes,
[4289.86 --> 4291.00]  impossible for us.
[4292.42 --> 4293.86]  but it's not
[4293.86 --> 4295.46]  impossible for Christ.
[4296.48 --> 4296.64]  See,
[4296.72 --> 4298.08]  only Christ's love
[4298.08 --> 4298.94]  is perfect.
[4299.08 --> 4300.16]  Only Christ's love
[4300.16 --> 4301.28]  was completely
[4301.28 --> 4302.72]  self-sacrificing.
[4302.82 --> 4303.72]  Only Christ's love
[4303.72 --> 4304.80]  was the selfless,
[4305.24 --> 4305.98]  unconditional,
[4306.42 --> 4307.80]  all-encompassing love
[4307.80 --> 4309.14]  that he endured,
[4309.20 --> 4310.16]  not just in his life,
[4310.36 --> 4311.20]  but in his death
[4311.20 --> 4312.44]  on the cross.
[4312.62 --> 4313.96]  Christ lived this
[4313.96 --> 4314.84]  out perfectly.
[4315.26 --> 4316.32]  He fulfilled the law.
[4316.52 --> 4317.68]  He loved flawlessly
[4317.68 --> 4319.90]  so that we
[4319.90 --> 4321.12]  can love
[4321.12 --> 4321.70]  too.
[4323.06 --> 4323.26]  See,
[4323.34 --> 4324.04]  Jesus lived
[4324.04 --> 4324.56]  this life
[4324.56 --> 4325.02]  that we've been
[4325.02 --> 4325.58]  called to live
[4325.58 --> 4326.30]  and then he died
[4326.30 --> 4326.98]  the death
[4326.98 --> 4327.84]  that you and I
[4327.84 --> 4328.38]  and all of us
[4328.38 --> 4329.54]  deserved to die
[4329.54 --> 4330.10]  and he did that
[4330.10 --> 4330.84]  in our place,
[4331.00 --> 4332.06]  bearing the weight
[4332.06 --> 4332.68]  of the sin
[4332.68 --> 4333.20]  of the world
[4333.20 --> 4333.96]  on his shoulders
[4333.96 --> 4334.94]  and taking it
[4334.94 --> 4335.50]  to the grave.
[4335.68 --> 4336.92]  But three days later,
[4337.28 --> 4338.42]  Jesus rose again
[4338.42 --> 4339.94]  from the grave.
[4340.06 --> 4340.94]  He defeated sin
[4340.94 --> 4341.34]  and death
[4341.34 --> 4342.50]  once and for all.
[4342.50 --> 4346.06]  And now he has given us
[4346.06 --> 4347.60]  freedom and grace
[4347.60 --> 4348.46]  and mercy.
[4348.90 --> 4350.08]  Now we can live this life
[4350.08 --> 4350.98]  knowing full well
[4350.98 --> 4352.12]  that we are redeemed
[4352.12 --> 4352.64]  in him
[4352.64 --> 4355.20]  because he loved us first.
[4356.10 --> 4356.84]  Now not only
[4356.84 --> 4358.26]  is our debt paid,
[4358.64 --> 4359.72]  but we have been granted
[4359.72 --> 4361.36]  the kingdom of God.
[4361.48 --> 4362.84]  We are co-heirs
[4362.84 --> 4363.52]  with Christ.
[4363.66 --> 4364.64]  We are successors
[4364.64 --> 4366.10]  to his eternal kingdom,
[4366.30 --> 4367.46]  clothed in righteousness
[4367.46 --> 4368.84]  and viewed by our
[4368.84 --> 4369.68]  heavenly father
[4369.68 --> 4371.66]  as pure and spotless.
[4371.66 --> 4372.92]  And it's all because
[4372.92 --> 4374.56]  of the unconditional,
[4374.82 --> 4376.02]  all-encompassing love
[4376.02 --> 4376.94]  of Jesus.
[4378.40 --> 4379.96]  And so as overwhelming
[4379.96 --> 4380.76]  as the call
[4380.76 --> 4381.88]  to love all of those
[4381.88 --> 4382.78]  around us
[4382.78 --> 4384.92]  may be,
[4386.10 --> 4388.36]  how much more overwhelming
[4388.36 --> 4389.62]  is the gift of grace
[4389.62 --> 4390.26]  and mercy
[4390.26 --> 4390.94]  and righteousness
[4390.94 --> 4391.96]  and eternal life
[4391.96 --> 4392.90]  that we receive
[4392.90 --> 4393.52]  from our Savior?
[4394.96 --> 4395.84]  It's no wonder
[4395.84 --> 4396.58]  we're indebted
[4396.58 --> 4398.22]  to love those
[4398.22 --> 4399.08]  around us forever
[4399.08 --> 4399.72]  for the debt
[4399.72 --> 4400.92]  that has been paid
[4400.92 --> 4401.48]  for us
[4401.48 --> 4402.74]  also can never
[4402.74 --> 4403.42]  be repaid.
[4404.42 --> 4405.46]  We are indebted
[4405.46 --> 4406.38]  to love others
[4406.38 --> 4406.98]  forever because
[4406.98 --> 4407.76]  our debt
[4407.76 --> 4409.02]  has been paid
[4409.02 --> 4409.98]  in full
[4409.98 --> 4411.24]  in Christ Jesus.
[4412.58 --> 4413.98]  Our calling then
[4413.98 --> 4416.02]  is to go out
[4416.02 --> 4417.24]  and show others
[4417.24 --> 4418.24]  this love of Christ,
[4418.38 --> 4420.02]  not for our salvation's sake,
[4420.28 --> 4420.98]  but because
[4420.98 --> 4422.04]  we have already
[4422.04 --> 4422.68]  been saved,
[4423.02 --> 4424.14]  because we have already
[4424.14 --> 4425.22]  been given salvation.
[4426.78 --> 4426.94]  See,
[4427.00 --> 4427.72]  Jesus is not
[4427.72 --> 4429.04]  only the example
[4429.04 --> 4430.22]  of love for us,
[4430.30 --> 4431.94]  but he's the means
[4431.94 --> 4433.58]  by which we can love.
[4434.72 --> 4435.46]  Through him
[4435.46 --> 4436.04]  we are able
[4436.04 --> 4436.74]  to show
[4436.74 --> 4437.78]  that love
[4437.78 --> 4438.58]  to those around us.
[4438.64 --> 4439.62]  It's because of Christ,
[4439.80 --> 4440.74]  it's through Christ,
[4440.82 --> 4441.86]  and it's by Christ
[4441.86 --> 4443.00]  that we can live out
[4443.00 --> 4443.60]  this love
[4443.60 --> 4444.78]  to those around us.
[4444.78 --> 4445.50]  It's all Christ.
[4446.78 --> 4448.00]  He is in all,
[4448.42 --> 4449.36]  he is through all,
[4449.46 --> 4450.62]  and he is the reason
[4450.62 --> 4451.44]  we can love.
[4451.54 --> 4453.00]  Christ is with you.
[4453.50 --> 4454.46]  You can fulfill
[4454.46 --> 4455.36]  this call to love
[4455.36 --> 4457.82]  because of him.
[4458.66 --> 4459.88]  Be blessed by this.
[4460.40 --> 4461.38]  Christ is with you,
[4461.90 --> 4462.72]  Christ before you,
[4462.82 --> 4463.64]  Christ behind you,
[4463.78 --> 4464.44]  Christ in you,
[4464.56 --> 4465.44]  Christ beneath you,
[4465.68 --> 4466.46]  Christ above you,
[4466.58 --> 4467.32]  Christ on your right,
[4467.48 --> 4468.28]  Christ on your left,
[4468.64 --> 4469.56]  Christ when you lie down,
[4469.72 --> 4470.42]  Christ when you sit,
[4470.58 --> 4471.36]  Christ when you arise,
[4471.50 --> 4472.50]  Christ in the heart
[4472.50 --> 4473.54]  of every man
[4473.54 --> 4474.20]  who thinks of you,
[4474.30 --> 4475.44]  Christ in the mouth
[4475.44 --> 4476.30]  of everyone
[4476.30 --> 4477.04]  who speaks of you,
[4477.28 --> 4477.92]  Christ in the eye
[4477.92 --> 4478.36]  of everyone
[4478.36 --> 4479.36]  who sees you,
[4479.74 --> 4481.38]  Christ in every ear
[4481.38 --> 4482.66]  that hears you.
[4483.92 --> 4485.00]  It's all Christ.
[4485.36 --> 4488.56]  Christ loves you
[4488.56 --> 4491.22]  and Christ allows you to love
[4491.22 --> 4494.36]  and so hear these words
[4494.36 --> 4496.98]  our debt is paid
[4496.98 --> 4499.56]  and our death's been died
[4499.56 --> 4501.62]  you are free
[4501.62 --> 4503.40]  you're free to love
[4503.40 --> 4505.76]  because that is the only response
[4505.76 --> 4507.80]  to the love of Christ for you and for me
[4507.80 --> 4510.00]  we're free to love
[4510.00 --> 4514.12]  because it is impossible to love too much
[4514.12 --> 4515.62]  amen
[4515.62 --> 4517.14]  please pray with me
[4517.14 --> 4519.38]  Father in heaven
[4519.38 --> 4522.22]  you have lived the perfect life
[4522.22 --> 4523.58]  of love for us
[4523.58 --> 4525.74]  and in doing so you died a death
[4525.74 --> 4527.40]  on the cross that all of us deserved
[4527.40 --> 4530.20]  but you defeated sin and death
[4530.20 --> 4532.66]  and are now not just the example
[4532.66 --> 4534.22]  of love for us all to follow
[4534.22 --> 4535.92]  but you are the means by which
[4535.92 --> 4537.72]  we can go and love those around us
[4537.72 --> 4540.32]  and so God we pray in whatever context
[4540.32 --> 4541.44]  we find ourselves in
[4541.44 --> 4543.72]  in whether it's our homes
[4543.72 --> 4544.86]  in our social circles
[4544.86 --> 4545.98]  in our workplaces
[4545.98 --> 4549.54]  in any situation we find ourselves in this week
[4549.54 --> 4552.48]  God that you will shine out of us
[4552.48 --> 4554.82]  that your love will shine out of us
[4554.82 --> 4555.96]  and you will be glorified
[4555.96 --> 4558.06]  by how we love those around us
[4558.06 --> 4560.28]  may that be the conviction of our hearts
[4560.28 --> 4561.96]  going out of this place today
[4561.96 --> 4564.16]  as we go into the world
[4564.16 --> 4566.00]  Lord we think of those who are elsewhere
[4566.00 --> 4567.40]  those who are going into the world
[4567.40 --> 4568.60]  that there are Mexico team
[4568.60 --> 4569.82]  the many other missions teams
[4569.82 --> 4571.08]  that are out and about
[4571.08 --> 4572.00]  and traveling right now
[4572.00 --> 4573.72]  God may love reign
[4573.72 --> 4575.60]  in their lives as well
[4575.60 --> 4578.64]  and may we show Christ's love
[4578.64 --> 4579.84]  may we show your love
[4579.84 --> 4581.54]  to the world around us
[4581.54 --> 4582.56]  we pray in your name
[4582.56 --> 4583.20]  Amen
[4583.20 --> 4589.38]  Amen
[4589.42 --> 4591.20]  Amen
[4591.20 --> 4594.88]  Amen
[4594.88 --> 4597.18]  Amen
[4597.18 --> 4598.56]  Amen
[4598.58 --> 4608.94]  Amen
[4608.94 --> 4625.80]  My Lord, what love is this that pain so dearly
[4625.80 --> 4641.80]  That I, the guilty one, may all be amazing love
[4641.80 --> 4650.80]  Oh, what sacrifice, the sorrow of God in mourning
[4650.80 --> 4658.94]  Oh, can you please, and my death be died
[4658.94 --> 4673.80]  That I, the guilty one, may all be amazing
[4673.80 --> 4688.20]  So, they watched the night, this night's rejected
[4688.20 --> 4702.20]  My Lord, what life shall come for me
[4702.20 --> 4715.20]  How amazing love, oh, what sacrifice, the sorrow of God in mourning
[4715.20 --> 4722.20]  My dearly days and my dearly days
[4722.20 --> 4728.20]  That I, the guilty one, may all be amazing
[4728.20 --> 4736.20]  That I, the guilty one, may all be amazing
[4736.20 --> 4746.20]  And I, this love of Christ
[4746.20 --> 4753.20]  Shall hold my rivers
[4753.20 --> 4766.20]  Come walk, oh, what sacrifice, the sorrow of God in mourning
[4766.20 --> 4779.20]  Come here to God, oh, what sacrifice, the sorrow of God in mourning
[4779.20 --> 4785.20]  My dearly days and my merry days
[4785.20 --> 4792.20]  And I, the guilty one, may all be amazing
[4792.20 --> 4798.20]  And I, the guilty one, may all be amazing
[4798.20 --> 4816.20]  And so as we go from this place, we remember that gift of love
[4816.20 --> 4818.76]  That amazing love that Christ has shown us
[4818.76 --> 4821.14]  And may we go and show that to others
[4821.14 --> 4823.96]  If you need prayer this morning, there will be a prayer person up front here
[4823.96 --> 4825.32]  With a yellow name tag
[4825.32 --> 4828.06]  Please feel free to go up to them and seek prayer
[4828.06 --> 4829.26]  Those can be prayers of blessing
[4829.26 --> 4833.12]  And of course prayers of things in need
[4833.12 --> 4836.46]  And if you are looking for prayer but don't want to come up
[4836.46 --> 4838.46]  Talk to your neighbor, I'm sure they'll pray for you too
[4838.46 --> 4842.28]  Now, if you will join us after the service for some refreshments
[4842.28 --> 4843.84]  That would be awesome as well
[4843.84 --> 4846.74]  But before we go, please hear this priestly blessing
[4846.74 --> 4848.48]  Found in Numbers 6
[4848.48 --> 4853.10]  The Lord bless you and keep you

[4855.96 --> 4857.22]  And be gracious to you
[4857.22 --> 4859.84]  The Lord turn His face toward you
[4859.84 --> 4861.82]  And give you His peace
[4861.82 --> 4863.94]  And all of God's people say
[4863.94 --> 4864.84]  Amen
[4865.04 --> 4892.28]  We are of those

[5222.28 --> 5252.26]  Thank you.
[5252.28 --> 5282.26]  Thank you.
[5282.28 --> 5312.26]  Thank you.
[5312.28 --> 5342.26]  Thank you.
[5342.28 --> 5372.26]  Thank you.
[5372.28 --> 5402.26]  Thank you.
[5402.28 --> 5432.26]  Thank you.

[5492.28 --> 5522.26]  Thank you.
[5522.28 --> 5552.26]  Thank you.
