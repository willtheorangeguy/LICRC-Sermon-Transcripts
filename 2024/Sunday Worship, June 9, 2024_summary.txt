• Four questions will be explored: what is the gospel?
• Romans 1:16-17, emphasizing that the power of God is unto salvation
• The gospel as the power of God unto salvation, revealing the righteousness of God by faith
• Jesus as the righteousness of God, who lived the life we should have lived and died the death we deserved
• Christ's substitutionary atonement, paying the penalty for our sin and bearing God's wrath
• The resurrection of Jesus, making him victorious over sin and death
• Our call to be witnesses of Jesus' message, proclaiming his victory to the ends of the earth
• The Holy Spirit has been sent to help people live out the truth in the world
• The gospel is not just about loving God and loving others, but it's a more specific message that comes from Jesus Christ
• The order of things matters: the gospel must come first, followed by transformation and living out one's faith
• Regeneration (being born again) precedes faith; people can't believe in the gospel without already being spiritually transformed
• Believing in the gospel unites us with Christ.
• The gospel cannot be exchanged for human law or messaging
• The gospel is a message that gives eternal hope, not terrestrial hope or lesser glory
• God makes the gospel known through various means and ensures we receive it accurately
• Believing in Jesus as Lord and His resurrection from the dead is essential to salvation
• Calling on the name of the Lord requires hearing and believing in Him first
• Hearing about Jesus comes through someone preaching, which requires them being called by God
• This creates a cycle where people must be called, hear, believe, preach, and then call others
• The gospel is given by God through sending out preachers.
• Those who speak God's word have a unique calling to build up the church and equip its members for their faith expression.
• Everyone who believes is called to preach the gospel.
• Faith comes from hearing the message, which is heard through the word of Christ.
• Sometimes, people may misunderstand the message and think it's enough to simply live out the gospel rather than preaching it.
• The example of the speaker or others is not sufficient for salvation
• People are saved by believing in the message, not just following an example
• The life one lives confirms their faith and validates the truth of the gospel
• Salvation requires hearing and confessing Jesus as Lord, and believing He was raised from the dead
• Preaching the gospel requires using words, scriptures, and the Holy Spirit to transform lives
• God promises to use broken vessels like us to accomplish His purposes.
• The Word of God will accomplish its purpose and return to Him
• God gives the seed of the gospel, causes it to grow, and take root
• Believers proclaim His kingdom and are ambassadors of the gospel
• The message of the gospel sustains Christian lives through faith
• God is able to establish and strengthen believers in their faith through the gospel
• The gospel is not just a way into Christian faith but also the way of Christian faith
• Faith starts by believing in the gospel and is transformed by it
• Justification and sanctification come from believing the gospel
• Romans 6:5-7 emphasizes the union with Christ through death to sin, leading to new life
• The gospel transforms every aspect of life when applied to it
• Victory over sin and addictions comes from being united to Christ through the gospel.
• The importance of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ
• The distinction between experiential/emotional expression and spiritual/internal reality
• The unity of believers with Jesus, redefining their reality and changing everything about them
