[0.00 → 29.98] Thank you.
[30.00 → 59.98] Thank you.
[60.00 → 89.98] Thank you.
[90.00 → 119.98] Thank you.
[120.00 → 149.98] Thank you.
[150.00 → 179.98] Thank you.
[180.00 → 209.98] Thank you.
[209.98 → 239.96] Thank you.
[239.98 → 241.98] Thank you.
[269.98 → 271.98] Thank you.
[299.98 → 301.98] Thank you.
[329.98 → 331.98] Thank you.
[359.98 → 361.98] Thank you.
[369.98 → 371.98] Thank you.
[371.98 → 379.40] Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 47, which sings,
[379.92 → 382.40] Sing praises to God, sing praises.
[382.70 → 385.82] Sing praises to our King, sing praises.
[385.92 → 388.56] So let's sing praises to our King of Kings this morning.
[395.56 → 398.92] In the darkness we were waiting,
[398.92 → 401.92] Without hope and without light,
[403.20 → 406.06] Till from heaven you came running,
[406.48 → 409.92] There was mercy in your eyes,
[410.12 → 413.26] To fulfill the law and prophets,
[413.66 → 415.92] To a virgin kingdom heard,
[417.32 → 420.22] From a throne of endless glory,
[420.68 → 423.74] To a cradle in the dirt.
[428.92 → 433.16] Praise the Father,
[433.88 → 436.54] Praise the Son,
[437.38 → 440.12] Praise the Spirit,
[440.92 → 443.50] Three in one,
[444.34 → 447.20] God of glory,
[447.92 → 449.66] Majesty,
[451.30 → 455.66] Praise forever to the King,
[455.66 → 457.66] Of King.
[462.12 → 465.66] To reveal the kingdom prime,
[466.04 → 468.66] And to reconcile the lost,
[469.66 → 471.66] To redeem the whole creation,
[473.00 → 475.66] You do not despise the cross,
[476.72 → 479.62] For even in your suffering,
[480.04 → 483.08] You sought to the other side,
[483.08 → 486.38] Knowing this was our salvation,
[486.38 → 487.44] Jesus,
[487.68 → 490.38] For our sake you died.
[495.28 → 499.12] Praise the Father,
[499.64 → 502.42] Praise the Son,
[503.24 → 505.96] Praise the Spirit,
[506.70 → 509.28] Three in one,
[509.28 → 512.86] God of glory,
[513.56 → 514.60] Majesty,
[515.14 → 515.82] Praise the Son,
[515.82 → 516.26] Praise the Son,
[516.26 → 517.52] Praise the Son,
[517.52 → 517.94] Praise the Son,
[517.94 → 518.72] Praise the Son,
[518.72 → 518.78] Praise the Son,
[518.78 → 518.96] Praise the Son,
[518.96 → 519.42] Praise the Son,
[519.42 → 519.76] Praise the Son,
[519.76 → 519.86] Praise the Son,
[519.86 → 521.20] To the King,
[521.64 → 522.90] A King.
[527.58 → 531.18] And the morning that you rose,
[531.40 → 534.72] All heaven held its breath,
[535.14 → 538.14] Till that stone was moved for good,
[538.14 → 548.14] For the Lamb had conquered death, and the dead rose from their tombs, and the angels stood in awe.
[549.00 → 561.96] For the souls of all who come to the Father are restored, and the church of Christ was born, and the spirit lived aflame.
[561.96 → 575.64] Now this gospel truth of old shall not kneel, shall not faint. By His blood and in His name, in His freedom I am free.
[576.22 → 582.64] For the love of Jesus Christ, who hath resurrected me.
[582.64 → 601.64] Praise the Father, praise the Son, praise the Spirit, three in one.
[601.64 → 616.06] God of glory, majesty, praise forever to the King of kings.
[616.06 → 629.30] Praise the Father, praise the Son, praise the Spirit, three in one.
[629.30 → 643.30] God of glory, majesty, praise the Son, praise the Son, praise the Son, praise the Son, and the Lord.
[643.30 → 653.66] O Bill, King Jesus, O Bill, Emmanuel.
[653.66 → 666.66] King of kings, Lord of lords, bright morning stars.
[668.66 → 679.16] And throughout eternity, I'll sing your praises.
[679.16 → 690.16] And I'll sing with you throughout eternity.
[692.16 → 704.16] All hail King Jesus, all hail Emmanuel.
[704.16 → 717.16] King of kings, Lord of lords, bright morning stars.
[717.16 → 719.16] King of kings, all hail King of kings, all hail King of kings, all hail King of kings, all hail King of kings.
[719.16 → 729.16] And throughout eternity, I'll sing your praises.
[729.16 → 740.16] And I'll reign with you throughout eternity.
[740.16 → 744.16] The Father, peace, all hail King of kings.
[744.16 → 750.36] I'm going to lead you in a prayer of confession.
[750.36 → 752.96] And at the end of that prayer, there will be time for a silent prayer as well.
[752.96 → 754.90] So please bow your heads with me.
[755.56 → 763.36] Living triune God, You have watched us with a love so deep, pursued us with a love so relentless,
[763.36 → 766.90] and intervened in our lives with a love so vast
[766.90 → 769.80] that we could hardly know its magnitude.
[770.98 → 773.00] And yet, Lord, time and time again,
[773.08 → 774.80] we have failed to love you in return.
[776.04 → 777.48] God, you call us to seek you,
[777.60 → 780.72] but instead we ignore you and turn to our own foolish ways.
[780.92 → 782.76] You ask us to love our neighbours,
[782.90 → 785.96] but we put up fences and walk away from those in need.
[785.96 → 788.66] You ask us to think of others before ourselves,
[788.96 → 792.48] but we remain distracted by our own lives.
[793.36 → 795.84] Our own schedules, our own devices.
[797.46 → 801.68] God of grace and mercy, we repent of all our wrongdoings to you,
[801.80 → 804.98] and we offer our confessions to you in this time of silent prayer.
[823.36 → 823.80] Amen.
[839.80 → 845.88] We pray all of these things in the name of our loving and gracious Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[846.26 → 846.54] Amen.
[846.54 → 854.28] We can be confident in the forgiveness of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[854.98 → 856.62] From 1 Timothy 1 we read,
[857.66 → 859.00] Here are words you may trust,
[859.70 → 862.42] words that merit full acceptance.
[863.42 → 865.96] Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.
[865.96 → 870.64] To all who confess their sins and resolve to lead a new life,
[871.44 → 872.04] He says,
[872.82 → 874.28] Your sins are forgiven.
[875.28 → 876.06] He also says,
[876.18 → 876.68] Follow me.
[877.68 → 880.58] Now to the one who rules all worlds,
[881.28 → 882.76] immortal, invisible,
[883.40 → 884.26] the only God,
[884.84 → 887.92] be honour and glory forever and ever.
[887.92 → 908.36] You are the Lord of this nation.
[908.36 → 915.36] You are the Lord of this nation.
[915.36 → 917.36] You are.
[918.68 → 921.16] You are the light in this darkness.
[922.32 → 924.06] You are the hope to the hopeless.
[925.44 → 927.22] You are the peace to the restless.
[929.22 → 930.64] You are.
[930.64 → 960.62] You are the Lord of this nation.
[960.64 → 963.86] The greater things have yet to come.
[964.08 → 967.64] The greater things are still to be done here.
[971.64 → 974.04] You are the Lord of creation.
[975.04 → 977.66] The creator of all things.
[978.34 → 980.64] You are the king above all things.
[981.94 → 982.64] You are.
[984.32 → 986.30] You are the strength and the weakness.
[987.62 → 989.44] You are the love and the broken.
[989.44 → 992.88] You are the joyous sadness.
[992.88 → 994.88] You are.
[994.88 → 995.88] You are.
[997.88 → 1002.84] There is no one like our God.
[1003.84 → 1008.44] There is no one like our God.
[1008.44 → 1015.44] The greater things have yet to come.
[1015.44 → 1020.44] The greater things are still to be done in this city.
[1020.44 → 1032.44] The greater things are still to be done in this city.
[1032.44 → 1044.18] The greater things have yet to come.
[1044.18 → 1052.22] Greater things have never come
[1052.22 → 1056.36] Greater things are still to be done here
[1056.36 → 1066.30] There is no one like our God
[1066.30 → 1072.40] There is no one like our God
[1072.40 → 1078.56] There is no one like you God
[1078.56 → 1085.74] There is no one like you God
[1085.74 → 1091.54] Greater things have yet to come
[1091.54 → 1094.68] Greater things are still to be done here
[1094.68 → 1098.68] There is no one like you God
[1098.68 → 1101.44] Greater things have yet to come
[1101.44 → 1107.60] Greater things are still to be done here
[1107.60 → 1115.12] Greater things have yet to come
[1115.12 → 1118.60] Greater things are still to be done here
[1118.60 → 1126.94] Greater things have yet to come
[1126.94 → 1133.10] Greater things are still to be done here
[1133.10 → 1137.26] Greater things are still to do here
[1137.26 → 1139.60] Even to renew our awareness
[1139.60 → 1141.26] Greater clothes and Segura
[1141.26 → 1141.84] Greater things have yet to come
[1141.84 → 1142.96] Greater things have yet to come
[1142.96 → 1144.92] Greater things are still to come
[1144.92 → 1145.64] Greater things are still to but
[1145.64 → 1147.54] Greater things have yet to come
[1147.54 → 1148.76] professors are still to come
[1148.76 → 1150.12] EL so much of t duty can exercise
[1150.12 → 1174.90] Before the throne of God above, I am a strong and perfect King,
[1174.90 → 1183.90] A great high priest whose name is God, Whoever lives at peace for me.
[1185.00 → 1194.34] My name is graven on His hands, My name is written on His heart,
[1194.62 → 1203.74] I know that while in heaven He stands, No tongue can give me less deep heart,
[1203.74 → 1208.74] No tongue can give me less deep heart.
[1215.22 → 1224.74] When Satan tempts me to despair, And tells me of the guilt within,
[1224.74 → 1233.74] Upward I look and see Him there, Who made an end of all my sin.
[1234.88 → 1243.74] Because the sinless Saviour died, My sinful soul is now to free,
[1243.74 → 1252.74] For God the justice satisfied, To look on Him and pardon me,
[1252.74 → 1256.74] To look on Him and pardon me.
[1256.74 → 1274.74] He holds Him there, The risen Lamb, My purpose, Father's righteousness,
[1274.74 → 1284.74] The plain unchangeable I am, The King of glory and of grace.
[1284.74 → 1294.74] One with Himself I cannot die, My soul is purchased by His blood,
[1294.74 → 1299.74] My life is hid with Christ on high, My life is hid with Christ on high,
[1299.74 → 1309.74] With Christ my Saviour and my God, With Christ my Saviour and my God.
[1309.74 → 1334.74] With Christ my Saviour and my God, With Christ my Saviour and my God.
[1334.74 → 1363.74] For before we move to the offering, We're going to take some time together to hear from the Mexico mission team,
[1363.74 → 1367.74] And to commission them in the work that God has called them to do.
[1367.74 → 1370.74] And so, to begin, I'm going to invite Brandon to come to the front,
[1370.74 → 1375.74] And he's going to share just a quick overview of the kinds of things that they will be doing,
[1375.74 → 1378.74] And our ministry partners down there.
[1390.74 → 1391.74] Just keep talking.
[1393.74 → 1407.74] Switching to red, there you go.
[1407.74 → 1409.74] I think, right?
[1409.74 → 1410.74] Yep.
[1410.74 → 1413.74] This actually works great because I was going to do the offering too.
[1413.74 → 1415.74] So the offering is the same thing as what I'm going to talk about now.
[1415.74 → 1416.74] So we'll just do one little one.
[1416.74 → 1418.74] But yeah.
[1418.74 → 1421.74] So Mexico trip this year, there is a T-Bus 7-Bus going down.
[1421.74 → 1428.74] It is quite a bit smaller than normal, but it's a cool, it's kind of like today where most of the women are gone.
[1428.74 → 1432.74] This trip is basically all dominated by men besides MJ.
[1432.74 → 1434.74] So it's a real cool trip that way.
[1434.74 → 1437.74] It's a different dynamic, having all guys on the trip.
[1437.74 → 1440.74] Probably be a little bit smellier and all that too, but it'll be fun.
[1440.74 → 1447.74] So this year, our predominant kind of stuff that's going to be going on, we have kind of, I guess, three areas.
[1447.74 → 1449.74] Abi linos will be going back to again, of course, as well.
[1449.74 → 1452.74] You guys, I think most of you know them.
[1452.74 → 1467.74] So with them, we're going to be working on their youth ministry, strengthening that, just kind of trying to make a long term goal is always not a little goal, but a process been trying to make their youth program similar to ours is they, they really see a lot of value in how ours works.
[1467.74 → 1470.74] In terms of our 2020 small groups, things like that.
[1470.74 → 1475.74] And we're just kind of training them and their youth leaders and their youth in terms of how that works.
[1475.74 → 1478.74] So that will be ongoing again as well.
[1478.74 → 1482.74] And then we have their VBS program, which is their young kids.
[1482.74 → 1486.74] May sound silly, but a lot of their little kids are actually the way they grow their church.
[1486.74 → 1488.74] So we minister to them.
[1488.74 → 1490.74] They'll have a hundred kids come out in a day.
[1490.74 → 1494.74] We'll do crafts, Bible lessons, games, different fun stuff with them.
[1494.74 → 1501.74] But Abi lino, the way the Mexican culture kind of works is kids under the age of like 10 or so don't have rules.
[1501.74 → 1505.74] They can do whatever they want, which means these kids often come to church alone.
[1505.74 → 1509.74] Their parents aren't believers, or they don't want to go to church, whatever it is.
[1509.74 → 1512.74] But their kids are allowed to and their kids, their friends are at church.
[1512.74 → 1513.74] It's fun at church.
[1513.74 → 1514.74] So they all go to church.
[1514.74 → 1519.74] So that's how Abi lino grows it because he gets the children kind of hooked on God.
[1519.74 → 1521.74] They really actually do become true believers.
[1521.74 → 1523.74] They understand what it is.
[1523.74 → 1526.74] And then their older siblings start coming, and then their parents eventually start coming.
[1526.74 → 1530.74] So that's been his overall plan of how he grows his church.
[1530.74 → 1533.74] And you can see the results because the church started with like six people.
[1533.74 → 1540.74] And I think to this date now it's a hundred and something members, adult members professing just through that system.
[1540.74 → 1541.74] So we'll be helping with that.
[1541.74 → 1543.74] And then they also have a feeding kitchen that we'll be helping with.
[1543.74 → 1545.74] They feed the community.
[1545.74 → 1551.74] Anybody can come for food if they're on hard times, whatnot, and they'll feed them seven days a week.
[1551.74 → 1553.74] Kind of very similar to night shift.
[1553.74 → 1554.74] Except for just take it. It's not dinner.
[1554.74 → 1556.74] It's lunchtime is what they do.
[1556.74 → 1558.74] So that's Abi lino's.
[1558.74 → 1564.74] We may be doing some septic tank things and stuff like that because we are planning on doing a homeless shelter for them over the next five years.
[1564.74 → 1567.74] But a lot of that depends on who's available and things like that.
[1567.74 → 1569.74] We won't be actually doing the work per se.
[1569.74 → 1572.74] It's just more overseeing excavators and things like that and stuff like that.
[1572.74 → 1573.74] So that's Abi lino.
[1573.74 → 1575.74] Then we'll be connecting, of course, with Jody.
[1575.74 → 1580.74] Jody this year has a couple projects for us in terms of they have a new house that they're almost finished.
[1580.74 → 1581.74] Not quite finished.
[1581.74 → 1582.74] Need a bit of manpower.
[1582.74 → 1583.74] So we'll be helping them with that.
[1583.74 → 1593.74] And then they have their men's rehab as well, which we visit every year and kind of just share stories and have a good time with our brothers in Christ that way.
[1593.74 → 1596.74] The third one is a new one that we're hoping works out this year.
[1596.74 → 1599.74] We're going to be connecting with an orphanage down there.
[1599.74 → 1604.74] The orphanage is actually run by a coalition of churches here in Langley.
[1604.74 → 1614.74] So we are going to be trying to join up with those guys and basically just trying to we have a lot of churches in Langley that work in Rosarito and Tijuana that kind of don't work together right now.
[1614.74 → 1617.74] And the idea is we're all going to start working together slightly.
[1617.74 → 1623.74] Of course, we'll all maybe have our own focuses and our own passions, but we're going to try to help each other out.
[1623.74 → 1625.74] So we'll help with their orphanage.
[1625.74 → 1628.74] They have help with Alba lino's homeless shelter, for example, things like that.
[1628.74 → 1630.74] We're just going to try to work together more.
[1630.74 → 1638.74] So it's just a more coordinated and kind of universal, I guess, church effort in Mexico by the churches in Langley.
[1638.74 → 1642.74] So those are not the CRC churches specifically.
[1642.74 → 1644.74] It's a multidenominational kind of group.
[1644.74 → 1651.74] It's just a bunch of us that actually honestly worked on a construction site together and all realize we all work in the same area and are all different churches.
[1651.74 → 1657.74] So that's what we'll be kind of connecting with in the three big kind of key items of this year.
[1657.74 → 1662.74] And then, of course, it's Mexico and God has huge plans for Mexico and everything changes, and we'll probably do a lot cooler stuff.
[1662.74 → 1664.74] So that's just the way it goes.
[1664.74 → 1665.74] But yeah.
[1665.74 → 1666.74] Yeah.
[1666.74 → 1669.74] Thanks, Brandon.
[1669.74 → 1686.74] Can we get the team who is going or at least those who are here this morning, can you guys come on up to the front?
[1686.74 → 1694.74] So as you see this group, I encourage you today to maybe grab one of them after service
[1694.74 → 1698.74] or reach out this week and ask what it is that you can pray for particular.
[1698.74 → 1706.74] But I do encourage all of you over the time that they are gone, they leave next Saturday to pray for them and remember them in your prayers.
[1706.74 → 1713.74] As they go and as they stand before us, we're going to commission them with a prayer and a bit of a liturgy.
[1713.74 → 1718.74] And so I invite you to join your hearts with mine as we send them out in this way.
[1718.74 → 1724.74] God has always been sending people on important missions.
[1724.74 → 1728.74] He sent Abraham to a strange land with promises of a bright future.
[1728.74 → 1732.74] He sent Moses to Pharaoh and to free the oppressed.
[1732.74 → 1736.74] He sent Samuel to anoint the unexpected David as king.
[1736.74 → 1742.74] And even when Jonah ran away from God sending, God sent him to preach repentance.
[1742.74 → 1747.74] And then God sent his son, Jesus, to redeem us all.
[1747.74 → 1752.74] And Jesus didn't stop there because he sends us to.
[1752.74 → 1757.74] He sends us as messengers to share his message of love and forgiveness.
[1757.74 → 1769.74] And he promised that when he sends us out that we wouldn't be alone, that he sends his spirit to be with us, whether we're close to home or travelling far.
[1769.74 → 1774.74] Today, we celebrate your being called and blessed by God.
[1774.74 → 1781.74] He blesses us with salvation and then blesses us again by letting us spread the good news of the gospel.
[1781.74 → 1786.74] And through us, he showers blessings on the whole world.
[1786.74 → 1792.74] And so, as a team, you are commissioned to continue this mission.
[1792.74 → 1803.74] You are sent out with the gospel to make disciples everywhere, to help those in need and to spread the assurance of forgiveness and new life available through Christ.
[1803.74 → 1815.74] To those of you standing here heading to Tijuana and Rosarito, Mexico, for this mission, go with the gospel and in the power of the Holy Spirit.
[1815.74 → 1817.74] May God bless your efforts.
[1817.74 → 1820.74] May he bless the relationships that you develop and foster.
[1820.74 → 1824.74] And may you see the fruits of your labour.
[1824.74 → 1830.74] I'm going to invite those of you who are family or elders in the church to come on up.
[1830.74 → 1833.74] We're going to lay hands on them and surround them.
[1833.74 → 1840.74] The laying on of hands is a picture for us of the Holy Spirit flowing through the church into them as they go.
[1840.74 → 1843.74] And so, a group up here, I'm going to invite you just to move to the centre.
[1843.74 → 1848.74] And then, whoever would like to come forward and lay on hands, I encourage you to do that.
[1848.74 → 1874.74] If you are not able to come forward, but would like to, you may hold your hand out as a picture of this same thing.
[1874.74 → 1879.74] And this is an image that even though we send a small group, it is the whole church that goes with them.
[1879.74 → 1885.74] It is the whole family of God that supports you and remembers you on your journey, faith, and mission.
[1885.74 → 1891.74] And so, receive this blessing from God.
[1891.74 → 1902.74] Holy God, as these people prepare to go, may you go before them to prepare a way for them.
[1902.74 → 1915.74] As this team prepares to go, may you go behind them to protect them from the attacks of the devil and the presence of sin.
[1915.74 → 1928.74] As each one prepares their heart and mind to go to Rosarito and to Tijuana, we pray, Lord God, that you would go beneath them to support them and to bolster them, to speak words of encouragement and hope to their hearts,
[1928.74 → 1939.74] even as they face the challenges of the day, whether it's hot weather, hard conversations, language barriers, or work that is new to our experience.
[1939.74 → 1947.74] And as each on this team prepare to go, may you, Lord God, go beside them to befriend them.
[1947.74 → 1950.74] May they know your nearness.
[1950.74 → 1958.74] And may the love that they have and are cultivating for you overflow out of them to all whom they meet.
[1958.74 → 1978.74] And God, even as we pray for these people going from our church, we pray for the church in Mexico, we pray for our partners there, for Jody and for Uriel and for Abi lino and for Erica and for everyone whom they will work with, the translators, the friends, the connections.
[1978.74 → 1984.74] We pray, Lord God, hold them and keep them.
[1984.74 → 1992.74] We pray, Lord God, that you would bless them, that you would make your face to shine upon them and that you would be gracious to them.
[1992.74 → 1997.74] Lord our God, turn your face toward them and give them your peace.
[1997.74 → 2000.74] And all God's people said, Amen.
[2000.74 → 2028.74] Amen.
[2028.74 → 2033.58] conversations together about what they did. And so I invite you to keep your eyes and ears out
[2033.58 → 2039.10] for that opportunity to hear more from them as well. May the Lord bless you as you give in worship.
[2058.74 → 2060.74] Amen.
[2088.74 → 2090.74] Amen.
[2118.74 → 2120.74] Amen.
[2148.74 → 2150.74] Amen.
[2178.74 → 2180.74] Amen.
[2208.74 → 2210.74] Amen.
[2238.74 → 2240.74] Amen.
[2268.74 → 2270.74] Amen.
[2270.74 → 2272.74] Amen.
[2280.78 → 2288.90] All right. All the kids can come forward right now and join me up at the front with my
[2288.90 → 2298.30] friend. It's not just a puppet. It's Hank the Hound. I'm not just a puppet. I'm your friend
[2298.30 → 2307.34] Hank. Well, I am a puppet. I'm not just a puppet. Come on up, come on up, everyone. Come on up,
[2307.44 → 2312.10] everyone. So guess what we're going to talk about today in children's worship time? What?
[2313.02 → 2321.62] We're going to talk about God's extravagant love. Ooh. Who can tell me what extravagant means?
[2322.58 → 2329.52] I can. I can. Just one second. Malachi? Yeah, it's kind of like extreme. Does anybody... Hank,
[2329.58 → 2335.06] do you have stories about something extravagant or extreme you did? Yeah. I even prepared a
[2335.06 → 2339.66] PowerPoint. You did? How did you know we were talking about it? I just had a hunch. All right,
[2339.70 → 2345.76] well, let's take a peek. What did you do, Hank? I went to a bunch of waterfalls. I feel like we've
[2345.76 → 2351.46] seen this before, Hank. I went to Bridal Falls first, and then I went to Niagara Falls. Hank,
[2351.46 → 2356.92] we've definitely done this shtick before. After that, we went south to Yosemite. I think it's
[2356.92 → 2362.34] Yosemite, Hank. And I was right at the very top there. See? That's me at the top. Do you see me?
[2363.12 → 2367.76] After that... We've done this for sure before, Hank. We're just repeating something, aren't we?
[2368.04 → 2375.48] After that, I went to Iceland and saw that cool waterfall, and then I went down into Victoria Falls
[2375.48 → 2383.54] in Zambia. And finally, the last one in Venezuela. We have definitely done this before, Hank. We've
[2383.54 → 2388.46] definitely done this before. All right, well, we're going to go to the room, and we're going to talk
[2388.46 → 2393.54] about extravagant things, okay? Yeah! You're going to stay here, though, okay, Hank? Mm-hmm. And the
[2393.54 → 2400.20] grown-ups are going to hear about how God's love is for all people, even the government.
[2400.20 → 2406.30] What? Of course the government! Thank you! So we're going to go and talk about that, but let's
[2406.30 → 2410.38] pray before we go, okay? Let's pray. Dear God, thank you so much for this day. Thank you that we
[2410.38 → 2415.40] could be in church, and that we could hear more about how it is that you love us so much. And we
[2415.40 → 2419.14] pray that as we go to children's worship time and the adults stay here, that you'll teach us all a
[2419.14 → 2423.88] little bit more about what that means. We pray this in your name. Amen. All right, kids, let's stand and do
[2423.88 → 2430.16] the blessing. All right, we're going to say the Lord be with you together. Are
[2430.16 → 2434.34] you ready? The Lord be with you.
[2460.16 → 2469.64] Before we come in congregational prayer, I just have one or two notes. Council is
[2469.64 → 2474.56] seeking nominations for office bearers. They're looking for positions of admin,
[2474.56 → 2482.42] elder, pastoral elder, and deacons. Nominations will run from March 10 to April 7. Nomination forms
[2482.42 → 2492.18] are available in the e-bulletin or from the office. I also would like to give an update.
[2492.18 → 2497.08] Many of you know Matthew and Rachel, who are members of a congregation for many years.
[2497.08 → 2503.16] Rachel has been dealing with health issues, and she has continued to decline for the last seven years.
[2503.16 → 2515.64] The latest update is that she is likely having stiff person syndrome. This means she's unable to do anything physical.
[2515.64 → 2522.48] We pray for strength for her and Matthew as he has to manage her care and needs as well as run the household.
[2522.48 → 2541.76] Shall we come to our Lord in prayer? We praise you God, Lord of the universe. You created the world we live in, the changing seasons, the beauty we see around us, rain, sunshine, plants springing up, plants budding.
[2541.76 → 2550.52] You created us to give you praise. We do that now together as we stand in your presence.
[2550.52 → 2557.96] We're thankful for the freedom to worship where so many around the world do not have this opportunity.
[2557.96 → 2568.84] We pray that many more people will come to see the need to worship you rather than spend time elsewhere pursuing worldly things that distract.
[2568.84 → 2579.52] We pray for those who deal with illness each day. Some for healing, physical ailments, some for mental, some both at the same time.
[2579.52 → 2590.40] We pray for Ellen White who is recovering from hip surgery and is in rehab. We pray that rehab may be effective for her, that she can become mobile again.
[2590.40 → 2598.82] We pray for Rachel, Skipper, and Matthew and their long-term needs, for pain management, for strength for each day.
[2598.82 → 2605.50] May your presence be felt in this trying time. May Matthew be strengthened in his difficult journey.
[2605.50 → 2619.62] We also pray for Kobe Deposed who is suffering from leukemia as a young mother. We pray for healing, for strength for her and her family.
[2619.62 → 2631.30] We continue to pray for members of this who have lost loved ones. Comfort those whose pain and loss is great, sometimes overwhelming.
[2631.30 → 2643.62] Most recently, Greta Kisser has lost her sister, who passed away in this last bit. We pray for strength for her as she has to deal with the loss of her own husband recently and now a sister.
[2643.62 → 2652.30] We pray for a blessing for her and strength as she navigates life without loved ones.
[2652.30 → 2662.30] We pray for family relationships that have broken down. We pray for healing and restoration to those who are living a difficult life.
[2662.30 → 2667.48] We pray for healing and healing. We pray for healing and healing. We pray for our church community as it seeks to reach out with your word.
[2668.48 → 2671.64] In various ways, such as gems, cadets, coffee break.
[2672.60 → 2675.82] Within our own walls and also those outside of our membership.
[2676.56 → 2682.96] With efforts such as the Mexico mission trip, night shift, meal programs, and Gateway of Hope.
[2682.96 → 2684.96] Lord, we pray for healing and healing.
[2684.96 → 2685.30] Lord, we pray for healing and healing.
[2685.30 → 2688.54] Lord, we have prayed for the team going down to Mexico this week.
[2689.36 → 2694.42] And we pray that your spirit may be able to surround them with protection.
[2695.08 → 2697.44] May they be effective witnesses for you.
[2698.54 → 2701.98] We are thankful for the support given to send this team down.
[2703.88 → 2709.48] We pray for the preaching of your word, Lord, that we may hear and take to heart what is said.
[2709.48 → 2713.32] Lord, we pray that this will strengthen us in our walk this week.
[2714.06 → 2718.56] That we may be good witnesses for you in this world around us.
[2720.18 → 2731.48] Lord, we pray for the many women of our congregation who have had a weekend away to be strengthened in their walks of life.
[2732.20 → 2734.48] Pray for safety as they return again to us.
[2734.48 → 2740.76] We pray all this in the name of Jesus Christ, our Saviour and Lord.
[2741.50 → 2745.60] We pray this in humbleness, aware of our sinfulness and shortcomings.
[2746.54 → 2746.88] Amen.
[2746.88 → 2747.04] Amen.
[2764.48 → 2765.48] Amen.
[2765.48 → 2766.48] Amen.
[2769.12 → 2776.64] I have had the privilege of being a pastor in full-time ministry for almost 14 years.
[2777.76 → 2786.20] And one of the things I have learned in those 14 years is that a particular joy of being a pastor
[2786.20 → 2795.38] is that everybody who you pastor has an opinion on what it means to be a pastor.
[2796.76 → 2800.18] Because everybody has an idea of how you're supposed to do your job.
[2800.74 → 2804.48] About what it is that you're supposed to focus your time on and your efforts in.
[2804.84 → 2809.28] And about how they can add things to that job description and the like.
[2809.34 → 2813.62] And take things away from what you think is important in that job description and the like.
[2813.62 → 2820.92] In 100 to 250 to 350, 1,350.
[2822.02 → 2826.62] Not just bosses, but micromanaging opinionated bosses.
[2829.60 → 2831.84] Now, that's none of you, right?
[2832.52 → 2833.74] This church is amazing.
[2834.34 → 2836.00] And actually, I do genuinely mean that.
[2836.00 → 2845.10] That has been less of my experience here as we understand our shared ministry life together well.
[2845.90 → 2854.72] But my point there is that there are few kinds of jobs wherein everyone has the definitive opinion
[2854.72 → 2856.58] on what it's supposed to be like.
[2857.66 → 2858.90] Pastors are one of them.
[2859.66 → 2862.14] Maybe teachers are another one, right?
[2862.14 → 2865.18] Parents tell you, it's your job to do this.
[2865.94 → 2868.12] You go, well, maybe that's your job, mom.
[2871.12 → 2874.48] Another one of those jobs is politicians.
[2875.74 → 2878.30] Because we elect them, at least in North America.
[2878.80 → 2881.58] We elect them so we get to tell them what to do.
[2881.90 → 2885.56] And we get to determine where they've fallen short of what they do.
[2885.56 → 2893.74] This morning, we are continuing a conversation that started last week looking at Romans 13,
[2894.12 → 2898.66] which is all about the government, all about established authorities,
[2899.34 → 2903.30] the source of them, and our relationship to them.
[2904.20 → 2908.00] Last week, we began looking at responsible citizenship.
[2908.50 → 2911.02] This week, we're going to look at responsible government.
[2911.02 → 2917.02] Now, I mentioned last week that these are contentious topics,
[2917.28 → 2922.04] and I've got to tell you, the kinds of conversations I had after church and throughout the week
[2922.04 → 2928.42] and the kinds of feedback that I got indicate to me that these are things you have opinions on.
[2929.38 → 2930.86] No one's surprised by that.
[2932.34 → 2934.92] You're probably going to have some more opinions today.
[2935.78 → 2936.76] Now, let me be clear.
[2936.86 → 2939.20] I'm happy to hear those and to feed those.
[2939.20 → 2941.36] But if you think I missed something,
[2942.06 → 2945.30] first question is going to be, did you miss last week?
[2946.68 → 2946.88] Right?
[2946.94 → 2949.92] Because I want you to make sure that you hear what we said last week.
[2950.00 → 2951.74] And then also, my second question is going to be,
[2952.02 → 2955.36] hey, maybe did you check out our podcast because we talked about it
[2955.36 → 2957.54] and maybe we picked up on some of those things there?
[2957.88 → 2965.02] Point is, this is the start of what I hope is for you an ongoing and continued conversation.
[2965.02 → 2971.42] And I know there's been some fascinating conversations that have happened as a result of this work together.
[2972.38 → 2978.62] And so to begin, we're going to read Romans 13, 1 to 7 again, which is what we read last week.
[2978.62 → 2991.42] And this week, as we go through, I encourage you to look for and anticipate what it is that we might have to hear from God about responsible government.
[2992.22 → 2995.32] And so if you have a Bible, I encourage you to open that up.
[2995.98 → 2996.86] We'll refer back.
[2996.92 → 2998.42] If it's on a device, turn it on.
[2998.64 → 3000.16] I get to Romans 13.
[3000.70 → 3003.64] The first time through, we'll be on the screen over my shoulder.
[3004.44 → 3005.30] Let's read together.
[3005.30 → 3015.14] Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established.
[3016.06 → 3019.24] The authorities that exist have been established by God.
[3020.28 → 3025.82] Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted.
[3026.58 → 3029.84] And those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.
[3030.42 → 3035.06] For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong.
[3035.30 → 3039.28] Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority?
[3039.58 → 3042.30] Then do what is right, and you will be commended.
[3043.10 → 3046.90] For the one in authority is God's servant for your good.
[3048.06 → 3050.60] But if you do wrong, be afraid.
[3051.14 → 3054.00] For rulers do not bear the sword for no reason.
[3054.76 → 3060.04] They are God's servants against agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.
[3060.04 → 3069.68] Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment, but also as a matter of conscience.
[3070.68 → 3077.34] This is why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants who give their full time to governing.
[3078.62 → 3081.00] Give to everyone what you owe them.
[3081.00 → 3083.28] If you owe taxes, pay taxes.
[3083.48 → 3084.60] If revenue, then revenue.
[3084.88 → 3086.38] If respected, then respect.
[3086.54 → 3088.44] If honored, then honour.
[3089.10 → 3090.10] This is the word of the Lord.
[3090.10 → 3099.08] So, as I mentioned, this is part two of what we began last week.
[3099.72 → 3112.70] Romans 13 is about the purpose and the role of the state and how we are to live under and in that authority as citizens.
[3112.70 → 3116.72] In part one, we looked at responsible citizenship.
[3117.32 → 3119.78] Today, we'll look at responsible government.
[3120.76 → 3129.64] Now, last week, we looked at four points that came out of that, and I will quickly recap that for us as a reminder, as a refresher,
[3129.74 → 3133.94] because there is parallels, of course, to today, and I want you to see that parallel.
[3133.94 → 3142.66] Well, responsible citizens understand that there is order to the structure of society that God has created,
[3142.76 → 3151.16] that God has built this order into creation, and that order includes governing authorities.
[3152.70 → 3153.82] We'll revisit that in a moment.
[3153.82 → 3158.88] And then, out of that, we said that responsible citizens do what is good,
[3160.12 → 3162.68] and that we do what is good for goodness' sake.
[3162.68 → 3167.38] That is not just because we fear punishment, but also as a matter of conscience.
[3168.30 → 3177.10] And then, lastly, the fourth point that we made last time was that our doing good looks like giving equitably as is due.
[3177.74 → 3180.30] Now, I said it already, but if you missed that, it's available online,
[3180.82 → 3184.34] and our podcast, Welcome to the Narthex, discussed that more deeply.
[3184.70 → 3190.18] This week, we're going to flip that coin and look at responsible government.
[3190.18 → 3196.58] And this time, I'm going to do that in three points coming out of this text,
[3196.66 → 3203.92] three points about responsible government or what responsible governing looks like from Romans 13.
[3203.92 → 3208.82] And so, first, responsible governments understand order.
[3209.64 → 3212.68] Now, that's the same as where we started last time, right?
[3212.76 → 3214.74] And so, we'll be a little bit more brief here.
[3215.40 → 3218.26] But second, responsible governments punish wrong.
[3218.80 → 3219.56] We will see that.
[3219.66 → 3223.54] And then third, responsible governments commend what is right.
[3223.54 → 3228.16] So, understand order, punish wrong, commend what is right.
[3228.44 → 3230.72] That's our map for this morning.
[3231.98 → 3233.38] So, we start with number one.
[3233.48 → 3237.42] Responsible governments understand that there is order.
[3238.42 → 3242.58] That's what we mean when we look and what we see when we look at verse one,
[3243.16 → 3244.22] where it says,
[3244.22 → 3249.86] There is no authority except that which God has established.
[3250.30 → 3254.76] The authorities that exist have been established by God.
[3256.14 → 3258.46] And first point to note, right,
[3258.64 → 3262.98] for our own posture as we enter into these discussions,
[3263.36 → 3267.22] is that it says no authority exists.
[3268.22 → 3268.80] Right?
[3268.80 → 3269.48] And that is to say,
[3269.62 → 3273.76] even the Roman emperor who persecuted Christians
[3273.76 → 3276.26] was established by God for his purposes.
[3277.24 → 3279.42] Or we can go a little bit back in Israel's history.
[3279.42 → 3281.22] Even Nebuchadnezzar,
[3281.42 → 3284.18] who carried the Israelites away in exile
[3284.18 → 3287.94] and who ordered Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
[3287.94 → 3289.48] to bow down to an image,
[3289.54 → 3290.28] and when they didn't,
[3290.30 → 3292.40] threw them into a furnace,
[3293.60 → 3297.66] even he is an authority established by God.
[3297.66 → 3302.04] The Bible tells us that these political governing leaders
[3302.04 → 3305.94] are there for God's purposes in history.
[3306.54 → 3311.00] And it's because these governing authorities
[3311.00 → 3315.30] are part of the created structure
[3315.30 → 3319.38] that God has imbued in society.
[3320.94 → 3323.40] Now, on the one hand, right,
[3323.40 → 3326.52] these governing authorities exist
[3326.52 → 3328.88] because there is sin in the world.
[3329.46 → 3329.68] Right?
[3329.70 → 3330.60] We read it very clearly
[3330.60 → 3331.88] that part of their responsibility
[3331.88 → 3335.68] is to punish evil or to restrain evil.
[3337.10 → 3339.20] And we'll make that point more explicitly
[3339.20 → 3340.08] in just a moment.
[3340.62 → 3343.04] But part of what that means, of course,
[3343.14 → 3344.40] is that there are certain functions
[3345.08 → 3346.42] of these authorities,
[3346.76 → 3347.98] of the government, right,
[3348.02 → 3349.12] of these governing authorities
[3349.12 → 3351.36] that only exist,
[3351.90 → 3354.02] are only exercised in the world
[3354.02 → 3355.80] because of the fall,
[3356.22 → 3357.14] because of sin.
[3357.94 → 3358.06] Right?
[3358.10 → 3360.46] The reality of evil in the world
[3360.46 → 3362.92] now has created the necessity
[3362.92 → 3365.32] for these governing authorities.
[3366.90 → 3367.80] And so to that end,
[3367.94 → 3370.02] political scientists
[3370.02 → 3372.96] and social philosophers
[3372.96 → 3374.98] like Jonathan Chaplin
[3374.98 → 3377.18] describe the state
[3377.18 → 3380.58] as an aspect of God's common grace.
[3381.90 → 3382.44] Right?
[3382.60 → 3384.94] Common grace in ensuring justice,
[3385.14 → 3386.38] common grace in ensuring
[3386.38 → 3388.64] that the marginalized
[3388.64 → 3391.56] are cared for and provided for.
[3393.00 → 3397.00] But what I want us also to understand
[3397.00 → 3401.34] that it's not just because of the fall
[3401.34 → 3403.60] that we have these governing authorities.
[3404.88 → 3405.40] Right?
[3405.42 → 3407.92] It's not only because there is sin in the world.
[3408.28 → 3412.98] The reality of what God has given us,
[3413.06 → 3414.88] the reality of what we call
[3414.88 → 3416.36] the cultural mandate
[3416.36 → 3418.44] in Genesis 1 and 2
[3418.44 → 3420.82] where God spoke to Adam and Eve
[3420.82 → 3422.82] telling them to be fruitful and multiply,
[3423.12 → 3424.86] to fill the earth and to subdue it,
[3425.16 → 3426.40] to rule over it,
[3426.40 → 3429.20] to join together with God
[3429.20 → 3431.36] in the ongoing act of creation
[3431.36 → 3432.84] by developing cultures
[3432.84 → 3435.66] and by exploring the world
[3435.66 → 3437.14] and digging deep into
[3437.14 → 3439.76] what God has provided for us.
[3439.92 → 3441.66] Part of that ongoing,
[3442.14 → 3445.46] creationally normative work in the world
[3445.46 → 3447.98] is the patterning
[3447.98 → 3450.48] and the ordering of society,
[3450.92 → 3451.92] groups of people,
[3452.06 → 3453.70] to accomplish these goals
[3453.70 → 3454.46] and these purposes.
[3454.46 → 3457.90] And so apart from the fall,
[3458.08 → 3459.26] that would still happen,
[3459.38 → 3460.54] that would still exist.
[3461.16 → 3461.24] Right?
[3461.32 → 3462.74] Society and people would
[3462.74 → 3465.12] order themselves,
[3465.48 → 3465.94] ourselves,
[3466.40 → 3467.30] in groups
[3467.30 → 3468.74] to accomplish the mission
[3468.74 → 3470.38] that God has given us.
[3472.28 → 3474.12] Now the patterns by which we organize
[3474.12 → 3475.52] or the systems that we put in place
[3475.52 → 3476.76] might look a little different,
[3476.88 → 3478.96] but they would still be there
[3478.96 → 3481.76] because we've been told by God
[3481.76 → 3483.80] to fulfill these purposes
[3483.80 → 3485.78] and we would do that
[3485.78 → 3487.32] with order.
[3487.82 → 3489.56] So these kinds of functions,
[3489.82 → 3491.02] which are now also
[3491.02 → 3493.66] part of the ongoing work of the state,
[3493.88 → 3495.18] just apart from
[3495.18 → 3497.14] the power that the state has
[3497.14 → 3498.28] of coercion
[3498.28 → 3499.78] or the power to punish.
[3499.78 → 3502.38] There are some people
[3502.38 → 3504.42] who have described this
[3504.42 → 3507.68] as the life-giving politics
[3507.68 → 3509.44] of the created order.
[3510.50 → 3510.72] Right?
[3510.76 → 3513.54] Of fulfilling the creation mandate.
[3514.88 → 3515.48] In fact,
[3516.18 → 3517.06] Richard Mao,
[3517.22 → 3519.52] who's a modern contemporary
[3519.52 → 3521.30] reformed theologian,
[3521.40 → 3522.56] he says that
[3522.56 → 3524.66] there is something about government
[3524.66 → 3526.74] when it is functioning properly
[3526.74 → 3528.48] that fits nicely
[3528.48 → 3529.92] into God's basic
[3529.92 → 3531.10] creating design
[3531.10 → 3532.36] for human life.
[3537.12 → 3539.16] Now part of what that means
[3539.16 → 3542.36] is that these governing authorities
[3542.36 → 3543.32] that exist
[3543.32 → 3544.52] are established
[3544.52 → 3546.16] for the purposes
[3546.16 → 3547.96] of human flourishing.
[3549.20 → 3551.10] They are part of God's
[3551.10 → 3552.10] created order
[3552.10 → 3553.26] for the well-being
[3553.26 → 3554.76] of his image bearers
[3554.76 → 3556.20] and his vice regents.
[3556.20 → 3556.50] That is,
[3556.80 → 3558.40] God has created us
[3558.40 → 3559.16] for a purpose
[3559.16 → 3560.42] and he has created
[3560.42 → 3561.80] or established
[3561.80 → 3563.40] in the language of Romans 13,
[3563.82 → 3565.02] he has established
[3565.02 → 3565.76] mechanisms
[3565.76 → 3567.34] for our flourishing
[3567.34 → 3568.94] in these purposes.
[3570.46 → 3572.16] One of those mechanisms
[3572.16 → 3575.42] is a well-ordered society,
[3575.94 → 3578.52] a well-governed society.
[3579.92 → 3581.82] And so in some people,
[3582.72 → 3583.46] there is
[3583.46 → 3585.82] what we might call
[3585.82 → 3587.66] in modern political theory
[3587.66 → 3590.28] a libertarian impulse
[3590.28 → 3593.50] to get rid of all government.
[3594.50 → 3596.16] But that denies
[3596.16 → 3598.76] the creational purpose
[3598.76 → 3600.66] that God has imbued
[3600.66 → 3601.64] those structures
[3601.64 → 3603.28] and systems with.
[3605.20 → 3605.88] Now,
[3606.08 → 3607.74] don't jump ahead
[3607.74 → 3609.50] because we do understand
[3609.50 → 3610.76] that when there's
[3610.76 → 3611.94] political overreach
[3611.94 → 3613.38] or systemic overreach
[3613.38 → 3614.26] then our reaction
[3614.26 → 3614.72] might be,
[3614.82 → 3615.10] you know what,
[3615.10 → 3615.66] it would be better
[3615.66 → 3616.42] if they weren't there
[3616.42 → 3616.84] at all.
[3618.26 → 3619.28] But I want to challenge
[3619.28 → 3620.40] immediately
[3620.40 → 3621.34] the presumption
[3621.34 → 3622.30] to jump from
[3622.30 → 3623.62] overreach
[3623.62 → 3625.10] to dissolution
[3625.10 → 3626.52] without asking
[3626.52 → 3627.96] what is good
[3627.96 → 3629.70] in their purpose.
[3633.72 → 3634.78] Governing authorities
[3634.78 → 3636.96] exist for the well-being
[3636.96 → 3639.68] of God's creation.
[3640.78 → 3641.00] Right?
[3641.04 → 3641.72] To ensure
[3641.72 → 3642.96] that we,
[3643.26 → 3644.16] image bearers
[3644.16 → 3645.32] and vice regents,
[3645.72 → 3647.24] would live out
[3647.24 → 3648.40] the stewardship
[3648.40 → 3649.62] responsibilities
[3649.62 → 3651.38] that he has called us to.
[3652.76 → 3654.38] And a governing authority
[3654.38 → 3655.36] then that wants
[3655.36 → 3656.66] to be responsible
[3656.66 → 3658.18] with the power
[3658.18 → 3659.64] that it has been granted,
[3659.82 → 3660.42] with the authority
[3660.42 → 3661.70] that it has been given,
[3662.00 → 3663.14] will recognize
[3663.14 → 3665.18] where it fits
[3665.18 → 3666.82] in this order.
[3668.26 → 3668.34] Right?
[3668.42 → 3670.60] A responsible government
[3670.60 → 3672.18] will understand
[3672.18 → 3673.54] that any authority
[3673.54 → 3674.54] that it has
[3674.54 → 3676.32] has been granted
[3676.32 → 3676.98] to it
[3676.98 → 3678.42] for a period of time
[3678.42 → 3679.64] by the creator
[3679.64 → 3680.34] of the world.
[3682.02 → 3683.22] And this probably
[3683.22 → 3683.88] won't surprise
[3683.88 → 3684.58] any of you,
[3684.82 → 3685.56] but a government
[3685.56 → 3686.94] that then denies
[3686.94 → 3688.04] there is a creator
[3688.04 → 3688.76] to the world
[3688.76 → 3690.46] is being irresponsible
[3690.46 → 3692.08] with the power
[3692.08 → 3692.74] it has been given.
[3692.74 → 3697.88] A government
[3697.88 → 3698.98] that understands
[3698.98 → 3700.30] that it has authority
[3700.30 → 3702.10] will remember
[3702.10 → 3703.14] that its power
[3703.14 → 3704.50] is from God
[3704.50 → 3705.32] and therefore
[3705.32 → 3706.98] will also know
[3706.98 → 3707.92] that its power
[3707.92 → 3709.14] is not ultimate.
[3709.82 → 3710.50] Right?
[3710.56 → 3712.00] Because only God's power
[3712.00 → 3713.02] is ultimate.
[3714.66 → 3715.66] And so working this out,
[3715.72 → 3716.72] a responsible government
[3716.72 → 3717.42] will understand
[3717.42 → 3718.86] that its role
[3718.86 → 3720.16] is to ensure
[3720.16 → 3722.00] then that the other powers
[3722.00 → 3722.68] or the other
[3722.68 → 3723.60] what we've called
[3723.60 → 3725.02] spheres of authority,
[3725.30 → 3726.42] the other established
[3726.42 → 3726.94] spheres
[3726.94 → 3728.48] or the other established
[3728.48 → 3729.92] authorities in life
[3729.92 → 3732.34] are able to function
[3732.34 → 3733.60] well
[3733.60 → 3734.78] in relationship
[3734.78 → 3735.60] to each other.
[3736.60 → 3737.34] And again,
[3737.42 → 3738.28] let's be clear,
[3738.36 → 3739.20] this isn't just
[3739.20 → 3740.56] about the emperor
[3740.56 → 3741.90] in relationship
[3741.90 → 3742.76] to other spheres
[3742.76 → 3743.58] or institutions
[3743.58 → 3744.44] like family
[3744.44 → 3745.16] or the arts
[3745.16 → 3745.86] or sciences.
[3746.52 → 3746.58] Right?
[3746.74 → 3748.02] In the world today,
[3748.02 → 3749.40] there are lots
[3749.40 → 3750.42] of other
[3750.42 → 3751.88] governing authorities
[3751.88 → 3752.76] that would also
[3752.76 → 3754.38] fall under this rubric
[3754.38 → 3755.30] and then also
[3755.30 → 3756.28] fall under
[3756.28 → 3757.90] the cross purposes
[3757.90 → 3759.94] of being for human flourishing
[3759.94 → 3762.66] and having a limited scope
[3762.66 → 3763.20] or sense
[3763.20 → 3763.86] of its power
[3763.86 → 3765.04] as part of
[3765.04 → 3766.38] this order.
[3767.84 → 3768.44] And so for instance,
[3768.56 → 3769.70] if you are a doctor,
[3770.70 → 3770.90] right,
[3770.94 → 3771.98] there's a medical college
[3771.98 → 3773.04] that has authority
[3773.04 → 3774.54] and defines
[3774.54 → 3775.16] in part
[3775.16 → 3775.68] the scope
[3775.68 → 3776.56] of your authority.
[3777.60 → 3779.48] If you're a trades' person,
[3779.82 → 3779.98] right,
[3780.02 → 3780.80] maybe you're familiar
[3780.80 → 3781.82] with the ITA,
[3782.26 → 3783.78] the Industry Training Authority,
[3784.26 → 3785.08] or maybe you're familiar
[3785.08 → 3786.06] with the BSA,
[3786.24 → 3787.52] the British Columbia
[3787.52 → 3788.50] Safety Authority.
[3789.34 → 3790.54] If you work nationally
[3790.54 → 3791.34] in building,
[3791.48 → 3792.20] maybe you're familiar
[3792.20 → 3793.60] with the Red Seal program.
[3794.88 → 3795.04] Right?
[3795.08 → 3795.74] All of us,
[3796.06 → 3797.38] especially here in BC,
[3797.64 → 3798.30] are familiar
[3798.30 → 3799.40] with unions
[3799.40 → 3800.38] and the amount
[3800.38 → 3801.22] of authority
[3801.22 → 3802.20] that they have
[3802.20 → 3803.08] in society
[3803.08 → 3803.86] and influence.
[3804.76 → 3804.94] Now,
[3805.18 → 3805.56] again,
[3806.16 → 3807.96] you might
[3807.96 → 3808.86] winsomely
[3808.86 → 3810.74] and I would probably
[3810.74 → 3811.52] agree with you
[3811.52 → 3812.36] that argue
[3812.36 → 3813.44] that some of these
[3813.44 → 3814.12] institutions
[3814.12 → 3815.62] have too much authority
[3815.62 → 3817.12] or have too much influence
[3817.12 → 3818.36] in the day-to-day
[3818.36 → 3819.52] running of life
[3819.52 → 3820.02] and business.
[3820.14 → 3820.66] And like I said,
[3820.70 → 3821.64] you're probably right
[3821.64 → 3822.60] in that argument.
[3823.22 → 3824.18] But the fact
[3824.18 → 3825.10] that they have
[3825.10 → 3826.62] too much influence
[3826.62 → 3828.28] is not
[3828.28 → 3829.42] an argument
[3829.42 → 3830.82] against the reality
[3830.82 → 3832.38] of their necessity
[3832.38 → 3834.04] and their place
[3834.04 → 3835.64] as providentially
[3835.64 → 3836.96] part of God's
[3836.96 → 3838.70] providing for human
[3838.70 → 3839.66] flourishing.
[3841.80 → 3841.94] Okay?
[3842.18 → 3842.60] In fact,
[3843.36 → 3843.98] it's something
[3843.98 → 3845.06] that we talked
[3845.06 → 3846.02] about last time,
[3846.66 → 3846.82] right?
[3846.90 → 3847.98] That because
[3847.98 → 3850.38] people have,
[3851.38 → 3853.58] because of sin
[3853.58 → 3854.30] in the world,
[3854.42 → 3855.38] because of the reality
[3855.38 → 3857.40] of our fallen nature,
[3857.40 → 3859.62] these governing bodies
[3859.62 → 3860.82] have a tendency
[3860.82 → 3862.40] to overreach
[3862.40 → 3863.28] and to stretch
[3863.28 → 3863.96] beyond
[3863.96 → 3864.96] their spheres.
[3866.08 → 3867.52] But that's also,
[3867.86 → 3868.06] then,
[3868.36 → 3869.12] part of the
[3869.12 → 3870.02] created order
[3870.02 → 3870.78] responsibility
[3870.78 → 3872.72] of the civil government,
[3873.06 → 3873.28] right,
[3873.32 → 3874.80] to hold those spheres
[3874.80 → 3876.18] in proper relationship
[3876.18 → 3876.82] to each other.
[3879.70 → 3880.28] Now,
[3880.60 → 3881.58] I get that maybe
[3881.58 → 3882.22] this is
[3882.22 → 3883.54] all very technical
[3883.54 → 3885.60] in its ordering,
[3885.60 → 3886.22] but this all
[3886.22 → 3887.12] comes together
[3887.12 → 3889.16] and it begs
[3889.16 → 3889.90] the question
[3889.90 → 3891.24] for those
[3891.24 → 3892.14] who are serving
[3892.14 → 3893.06] in government.
[3893.50 → 3894.38] It begs the question
[3894.38 → 3894.80] that we ought
[3894.80 → 3895.42] to be asking
[3895.42 → 3896.38] our leaders
[3896.38 → 3897.34] who serve
[3897.34 → 3897.84] in government,
[3898.26 → 3898.42] right?
[3898.58 → 3899.00] What,
[3899.16 → 3899.60] then,
[3899.72 → 3900.92] is the scope
[3900.92 → 3902.10] and the proper
[3902.10 → 3902.72] limit
[3902.72 → 3904.12] of my authority?
[3905.32 → 3905.54] Right?
[3905.60 → 3906.56] Since this authority
[3906.56 → 3907.56] is God-given,
[3908.02 → 3908.78] what purpose
[3908.78 → 3910.10] ought it to be
[3910.10 → 3911.70] exercised for?
[3913.22 → 3913.70] Now,
[3913.74 → 3914.22] those are the next
[3914.22 → 3914.82] two points.
[3915.60 → 3916.22] that we make,
[3916.56 → 3916.80] right?
[3916.84 → 3917.96] That a responsible
[3917.96 → 3919.08] government understands
[3919.08 → 3921.20] that there is order
[3921.20 → 3922.42] and that they have been,
[3922.58 → 3923.82] are part of that order
[3923.82 → 3924.88] and so,
[3925.16 → 3927.36] in ensuring that order,
[3927.48 → 3928.32] in working out
[3928.32 → 3929.92] for that order
[3929.92 → 3930.56] and the purpose
[3930.56 → 3931.70] of human flourishing,
[3931.92 → 3933.36] responsible governments
[3933.36 → 3935.40] will punish wrongdoing.
[3936.86 → 3937.38] That is to say,
[3937.44 → 3938.24] responsible governments
[3938.24 → 3939.58] exist in order
[3939.58 → 3941.62] to help limit
[3941.62 → 3943.10] the effect
[3943.10 → 3944.44] and the impact
[3944.44 → 3945.58] of evil
[3945.58 → 3946.50] on society.
[3947.20 → 3947.38] Now,
[3947.42 → 3947.84] you'll see this
[3947.84 → 3948.52] in verse 3.
[3949.54 → 3949.80] Right?
[3949.90 → 3950.84] Verse 3 says,
[3951.84 → 3952.38] for rulers
[3952.38 → 3953.38] hold no terror
[3953.38 → 3954.50] for those who do right,
[3954.62 → 3955.40] but for those
[3955.40 → 3957.98] who do wrong.
[3958.82 → 3959.88] And it's the same thing
[3959.88 → 3960.80] in the middle part
[3960.80 → 3961.48] of verse 4.
[3961.90 → 3962.14] Right?
[3962.14 → 3962.58] It says,
[3962.58 → 3964.18] but if you do wrong,
[3964.40 → 3965.00] be afraid,
[3965.50 → 3966.06] for rulers
[3966.06 → 3967.58] do not bear the sword
[3967.58 → 3969.18] for no reason.
[3970.72 → 3970.94] Now,
[3971.00 → 3971.58] linguistically,
[3971.86 → 3972.92] those two lines
[3972.92 → 3974.60] are held together,
[3974.98 → 3975.82] are tied together
[3975.82 → 3976.68] with the word terror
[3976.68 → 3977.46] and fear,
[3977.64 → 3978.82] which is the same word
[3978.82 → 3979.40] in Greek.
[3979.40 → 3981.26] So,
[3981.34 → 3982.34] responsible governments
[3982.34 → 3984.88] exist to punish evil,
[3985.14 → 3988.60] to rightly put
[3988.60 → 3989.82] the fear of God
[3989.82 → 3990.82] into citizens
[3990.82 → 3991.76] who need that
[3991.76 → 3992.68] in order to obey.
[3993.68 → 3993.84] Now,
[3994.32 → 3996.12] here's a great place
[3996.12 → 3996.80] to follow up
[3996.80 → 3999.38] converse together.
[3999.82 → 3999.94] Right?
[4000.00 → 4000.54] Because here,
[4000.86 → 4002.54] there are legitimate debates
[4002.54 → 4003.12] against,
[4003.84 → 4004.86] or in contrast
[4004.86 → 4005.88] of things like
[4005.88 → 4006.96] punitive justice
[4006.96 → 4008.28] versus restorative justice.
[4008.48 → 4008.64] There are,
[4008.64 → 4011.14] particular nuances
[4011.14 → 4011.86] that you might want
[4011.86 → 4012.76] to get into
[4012.76 → 4013.98] about the penal system
[4013.98 → 4015.34] in our own country
[4015.34 → 4016.26] or in other countries
[4016.26 → 4016.92] around the world.
[4017.24 → 4017.62] And again,
[4017.72 → 4018.44] these are really
[4018.44 → 4019.78] important conversations
[4019.78 → 4021.12] and I encourage you
[4021.12 → 4021.66] to have them
[4021.66 → 4022.60] and to discuss them
[4022.60 → 4023.66] in your care groups
[4023.66 → 4024.72] or other small groups
[4024.72 → 4025.48] or with your friends,
[4025.86 → 4026.58] colleagues,
[4027.06 → 4028.64] to engage in them.
[4029.26 → 4030.32] But the ground
[4030.32 → 4032.58] of those ongoing discussions
[4032.58 → 4033.84] remains the same.
[4035.48 → 4035.58] Right?
[4035.64 → 4036.98] Part of the government's purpose
[4036.98 → 4038.14] is to deal
[4038.14 → 4039.14] with wrongdoing
[4039.14 → 4040.18] and wrongdoers
[4040.18 → 4041.30] to impact,
[4041.68 → 4042.26] or to limit,
[4042.36 → 4042.50] sorry,
[4042.60 → 4043.48] the impact
[4043.48 → 4045.50] of that wrong
[4045.50 → 4046.74] in our shared society
[4046.74 → 4047.18] together.
[4048.40 → 4048.84] Right?
[4048.92 → 4050.12] If part of the order
[4050.12 → 4051.92] is governments exist
[4051.92 → 4054.52] to foster human flourishing,
[4055.52 → 4056.98] those kinds of things
[4056.98 → 4057.90] that work against
[4057.90 → 4059.22] our flourishing together
[4059.22 → 4060.86] need to be mitigated.
[4060.86 → 4063.14] That's part of the responsibility
[4063.14 → 4064.52] then of the government.
[4066.22 → 4068.34] Sometimes those things
[4068.34 → 4069.36] are mitigated
[4069.36 → 4071.64] with strict
[4071.64 → 4073.24] or severe
[4073.24 → 4074.74] authority.
[4075.40 → 4076.04] Right?
[4076.04 → 4076.44] The government,
[4076.58 → 4076.90] we read,
[4076.94 → 4078.52] is given the sword,
[4079.32 → 4080.68] which is an instrument
[4080.68 → 4082.56] of the punishment
[4082.56 → 4084.10] of death.
[4084.40 → 4085.32] It's an instrument
[4085.32 → 4086.38] of war.
[4086.38 → 4086.42] war.
[4087.84 → 4088.76] I think it was
[4088.76 → 4089.68] R.C. Sprout
[4089.68 → 4090.46] who said that
[4090.46 → 4091.18] the government
[4091.18 → 4092.42] is given the sword
[4092.42 → 4093.82] not so that it might
[4093.82 → 4094.64] rattle around
[4094.64 → 4095.68] in its scabbard
[4095.68 → 4097.52] and scare people
[4097.52 → 4098.28] with an ultimately
[4098.28 → 4099.12] idle threat,
[4099.38 → 4101.56] but so that if it needed to,
[4101.64 → 4102.44] it could pull it out
[4102.44 → 4104.50] and cut down
[4104.50 → 4105.44] evil.
[4107.84 → 4108.88] But that sword
[4108.88 → 4109.84] is wielded
[4109.84 → 4111.66] for the common good.
[4111.66 → 4113.68] Now,
[4113.92 → 4114.74] immediately,
[4115.52 → 4117.06] there are two things
[4117.06 → 4117.58] that bubble up
[4117.58 → 4118.10] to the surface
[4118.10 → 4119.12] in this conversation,
[4119.78 → 4119.94] right?
[4120.00 → 4120.74] And that is
[4120.74 → 4121.80] the politics
[4121.80 → 4123.58] and the theology
[4123.58 → 4125.38] of the death penalty.
[4127.86 → 4129.48] This is a divisive
[4129.48 → 4131.14] and controversial topic.
[4132.50 → 4134.24] Is the death penalty
[4134.24 → 4135.62] right and good?
[4136.30 → 4137.32] And from an easy
[4137.32 → 4138.20] and simple reading
[4138.20 → 4138.66] of Scripture,
[4138.84 → 4139.56] it seems clear
[4139.56 → 4140.12] that the government
[4140.12 → 4141.16] is given the authority
[4141.16 → 4143.24] to exercise punishment
[4143.24 → 4144.68] and so take a life,
[4144.86 → 4145.60] lose a life.
[4147.04 → 4148.18] And I don't want
[4148.18 → 4149.04] to dismiss
[4149.04 → 4149.90] or downplay
[4149.90 → 4150.82] that reality.
[4150.96 → 4151.90] I think that if you
[4151.90 → 4153.62] wilfully,
[4153.84 → 4154.36] intentionally,
[4154.62 → 4155.58] premeditatively
[4155.58 → 4156.58] kill someone,
[4157.38 → 4158.40] you have forfeited
[4158.40 → 4159.52] your own right to life.
[4159.60 → 4160.44] I think that is fair.
[4160.80 → 4161.42] And yet,
[4162.30 → 4164.92] I'm also very aware
[4164.92 → 4166.90] that the injustices
[4166.90 → 4167.70] that exist
[4167.70 → 4169.36] in the current
[4169.36 → 4170.24] penal system
[4170.24 → 4172.02] are racially biased.
[4172.18 → 4172.98] The injustices
[4172.98 → 4173.64] that exist
[4173.64 → 4174.28] in the current
[4174.28 → 4175.34] penal system
[4175.34 → 4177.04] are systemically biased
[4177.04 → 4178.46] against other people.
[4178.52 → 4179.04] And so it makes it
[4179.04 → 4179.86] very hard
[4179.86 → 4181.24] to discern.
[4182.40 → 4183.78] It's not as simple
[4183.78 → 4185.44] or as clear-cut
[4185.44 → 4186.34] as we might think
[4186.34 → 4186.76] because
[4186.76 → 4189.40] we are all
[4189.40 → 4189.90] struggling
[4189.90 → 4191.10] with the reality
[4191.10 → 4191.78] of sin
[4191.78 → 4192.90] in our midst.
[4192.90 → 4195.28] another thing
[4195.28 → 4195.88] that this is
[4195.88 → 4196.90] related to
[4196.90 → 4198.32] in the government
[4198.32 → 4199.26] holding the sword.
[4199.54 → 4200.28] Again, remember,
[4200.50 → 4201.48] the sword is
[4201.48 → 4202.82] a weapon of war
[4202.82 → 4204.84] and the idea
[4204.84 → 4206.78] of just war
[4206.78 → 4208.42] or are Christians
[4208.42 → 4209.74] able to participate
[4209.74 → 4211.12] in any form
[4211.12 → 4211.78] of warfare.
[4211.96 → 4212.84] This is related
[4212.84 → 4213.46] to that.
[4214.58 → 4215.18] And Christians
[4215.18 → 4216.38] like Augustine
[4216.38 → 4218.16] and Thomas Aquinas
[4218.16 → 4218.66] have done,
[4218.84 → 4220.06] have written
[4220.06 → 4220.96] voluminously
[4220.96 → 4222.22] on this subject
[4222.22 → 4222.68] and we're not
[4222.68 → 4223.04] going to get
[4223.04 → 4224.26] into it here
[4224.26 → 4225.60] except to say
[4225.60 → 4227.68] that one of the reasons
[4227.68 → 4228.38] that Christians
[4228.38 → 4229.18] have argued
[4229.18 → 4230.54] for just war
[4230.54 → 4231.46] is for
[4231.46 → 4232.58] the protection
[4232.58 → 4233.96] of those
[4233.96 → 4235.16] who are weak,
[4235.28 → 4235.98] is for
[4235.98 → 4237.24] the ensuring
[4237.24 → 4239.22] of human flourishing.
[4240.50 → 4241.10] And if you need
[4241.10 → 4241.98] to go to war
[4241.98 → 4243.04] to stop
[4243.04 → 4244.96] an autocratic ruler
[4244.96 → 4246.26] or a dictatorial ruler
[4246.26 → 4247.14] who has forgotten
[4247.14 → 4248.34] that their authority
[4248.34 → 4249.20] is given to them
[4249.20 → 4249.96] by God
[4249.96 → 4250.92] and has instead
[4250.92 → 4251.82] taken on
[4251.82 → 4252.92] more of their own
[4252.92 → 4253.78] in order to bolster
[4253.78 → 4254.30] themselves
[4254.30 → 4255.56] or to lay claim
[4255.56 → 4256.48] to more and more,
[4256.56 → 4257.98] to consume more and more,
[4258.22 → 4259.68] then there is a principle
[4259.68 → 4260.20] that says
[4260.20 → 4261.10] it is just
[4261.10 → 4262.42] for the well-being
[4262.42 → 4263.02] of those
[4263.02 → 4263.88] who are being
[4263.88 → 4265.10] trodden upon
[4265.10 → 4267.06] to wield that sword.
[4269.20 → 4269.98] But again,
[4271.24 → 4272.20] we can talk more
[4272.20 → 4272.90] about this.
[4273.76 → 4273.88] Right?
[4273.92 → 4274.32] And you
[4274.32 → 4275.82] are required
[4275.82 → 4277.04] to discern
[4277.04 → 4278.34] for yourselves
[4278.34 → 4279.60] in your context.
[4280.06 → 4281.16] What does Paul say?
[4281.26 → 4282.02] As a matter
[4282.02 → 4282.88] of conscience.
[4284.92 → 4285.78] This is one
[4285.78 → 4286.50] of those areas
[4286.50 → 4287.22] where Christians
[4287.22 → 4288.80] can have
[4288.80 → 4289.70] the freedom
[4289.70 → 4290.32] of conscience
[4290.32 → 4291.18] to decide
[4291.18 → 4291.92] differently.
[4292.08 → 4292.76] I am not
[4292.76 → 4293.46] going to stand up here
[4293.46 → 4294.58] and bind your conscience
[4294.58 → 4295.76] on these things
[4295.76 → 4296.82] one way or the other
[4296.82 → 4298.66] except to bind you
[4298.66 → 4299.88] to what Scripture
[4299.88 → 4300.64] binds you.
[4301.72 → 4302.18] And that is
[4302.18 → 4302.86] the presumption
[4302.86 → 4303.46] that the government
[4303.46 → 4303.98] exists
[4303.98 → 4305.54] and that it exists
[4305.54 → 4307.12] to punish evil.
[4309.30 → 4309.98] We can have
[4309.98 → 4310.66] a difference of opinion
[4310.66 → 4311.28] on how
[4311.28 → 4312.84] that is accomplished.
[4313.60 → 4314.76] But that it needs
[4314.76 → 4315.78] to be accomplished
[4315.78 → 4317.06] is fixed
[4317.06 → 4318.44] in God's Word
[4318.44 → 4318.90] to us.
[4322.08 → 4323.16] Now the other side
[4323.16 → 4324.60] and this continues
[4324.60 → 4326.70] is our third point.
[4326.82 → 4327.82] Responsible government
[4327.82 → 4328.96] exists
[4328.96 → 4329.96] to commend
[4329.96 → 4331.88] what is right.
[4331.88 → 4333.48] This again
[4333.48 → 4334.18] comes from
[4334.18 → 4335.02] verse 3 and 4
[4335.02 → 4335.74] in different parts.
[4336.24 → 4336.70] Do you want
[4336.70 → 4337.58] to be free
[4337.58 → 4338.52] from fear
[4338.52 → 4339.30] of the one
[4339.30 → 4339.96] in authority?
[4340.86 → 4342.22] Do what is right
[4342.22 → 4343.32] and you will be
[4343.32 → 4343.72] commended.
[4345.00 → 4345.44] For the one
[4345.44 → 4346.06] in authority
[4346.06 → 4347.60] is God's servant
[4347.60 → 4348.62] for your good.
[4350.80 → 4351.66] The Belgian
[4351.66 → 4352.26] Confession
[4352.26 → 4352.98] which is a
[4352.98 → 4354.66] summary document
[4354.66 → 4355.60] of the Christian
[4355.60 → 4356.30] Reformed Church
[4356.30 → 4357.26] Reformed tradition
[4357.26 → 4358.64] says
[4358.64 → 4359.80] that the government
[4359.80 → 4360.58] exists
[4360.58 → 4361.70] to contribute
[4361.70 → 4362.90] to the advancement
[4362.90 → 4364.14] of society
[4364.14 → 4365.50] that is pleasing
[4365.50 → 4366.28] to God.
[4367.98 → 4368.58] The idea
[4368.58 → 4369.66] that responsible
[4369.66 → 4370.60] governments
[4370.60 → 4372.38] commend what is right
[4372.38 → 4373.64] will then also
[4373.64 → 4375.28] build up
[4375.28 → 4375.90] what is good
[4375.90 → 4376.66] for society.
[4379.24 → 4379.80] And
[4379.80 → 4381.68] inherent in that
[4381.68 → 4382.28] I think
[4382.28 → 4384.22] are limits
[4384.22 → 4385.56] to
[4385.56 → 4386.88] a government's
[4386.88 → 4387.40] authority.
[4388.14 → 4388.70] Or to use
[4388.70 → 4389.12] the language
[4389.12 → 4389.58] that we have
[4389.58 → 4389.96] been using
[4389.96 → 4390.42] these last
[4390.42 → 4390.94] couple weeks
[4390.94 → 4392.06] the spheres
[4392.06 → 4393.04] have edges.
[4394.72 → 4395.44] There's
[4395.44 → 4397.86] a point
[4397.86 → 4398.86] whereby
[4398.86 → 4399.88] that
[4399.88 → 4400.98] authority
[4400.98 → 4402.12] is limited.
[4403.56 → 4404.20] So rulers
[4404.20 → 4405.76] hold no terror
[4405.76 → 4407.40] and people
[4407.40 → 4408.42] are to be
[4408.42 → 4409.68] hold no terror
[4409.68 → 4410.08] for people
[4410.08 → 4411.08] who do good
[4411.08 → 4411.56] and people
[4411.56 → 4412.22] are to be
[4412.22 → 4412.62] free.
[4412.62 → 4413.70] free from
[4413.70 → 4414.52] the establishment
[4414.52 → 4415.54] if they do
[4415.54 → 4416.26] what is right.
[4417.34 → 4417.74] So I think
[4417.74 → 4418.38] part of what
[4418.38 → 4419.20] comes out
[4419.20 → 4420.30] of this idea
[4420.30 → 4421.78] is the
[4421.78 → 4422.42] principle
[4422.42 → 4423.70] in political
[4423.70 → 4424.44] theory we talk
[4424.44 → 4424.78] about the
[4424.78 → 4425.36] principle of
[4425.36 → 4426.50] limited powers.
[4427.46 → 4428.42] That governing
[4428.42 → 4429.04] authorities
[4429.04 → 4430.38] whether in
[4430.38 → 4431.54] a parliamentary
[4431.54 → 4432.56] system or
[4432.56 → 4433.54] in a
[4433.54 → 4434.68] democratic
[4434.68 → 4435.10] republic
[4435.10 → 4435.56] system
[4435.56 → 4436.12] depending on
[4436.12 → 4437.06] what you like
[4437.06 → 4437.40] that there's
[4437.40 → 4438.10] a limit
[4438.10 → 4438.86] to the
[4438.86 → 4439.50] powers
[4439.50 → 4440.52] of those
[4440.52 → 4441.36] people who
[4441.36 → 4442.20] serve in
[4442.20 → 4442.54] government.
[4442.62 → 4443.16] be it the
[4443.16 → 4443.68] prime minister
[4443.68 → 4444.48] or the
[4444.48 → 4444.84] president
[4444.84 → 4445.86] the emperor
[4445.86 → 4446.84] or the king.
[4448.02 → 4448.50] And I think
[4448.50 → 4449.12] as well
[4449.12 → 4450.28] there are
[4450.28 → 4451.70] principles here
[4451.70 → 4452.66] of civil
[4452.66 → 4453.22] freedom.
[4454.82 → 4454.98] Right?
[4455.10 → 4455.74] Civil freedoms
[4455.74 → 4456.16] whether that's
[4456.16 → 4456.94] the freedom
[4456.94 → 4457.50] of religion
[4457.50 → 4458.16] or assembly
[4458.16 → 4459.18] or the
[4459.18 → 4459.50] freedom
[4459.50 → 4461.22] of speech
[4461.22 → 4462.82] to discourse
[4462.82 → 4463.74] about these
[4463.74 → 4464.16] things
[4464.16 → 4465.34] free from
[4465.34 → 4466.94] the fear
[4466.94 → 4468.28] of being
[4468.28 → 4469.00] punished
[4469.00 → 4470.58] for having
[4470.58 → 4471.32] ideas
[4471.32 → 4471.76] that may
[4471.76 → 4472.50] be contrary
[4472.50 → 4473.22] to the
[4473.22 → 4473.60] ideas of
[4473.60 → 4473.84] the people
[4473.84 → 4474.44] around us.
[4474.54 → 4474.86] I think
[4474.86 → 4475.44] that's all
[4475.44 → 4476.28] in here.
[4477.98 → 4478.60] Now notice
[4478.60 → 4480.20] that Paul
[4480.20 → 4481.14] calls these
[4481.14 → 4481.54] governing
[4481.54 → 4482.18] authorities
[4482.18 → 4483.02] then,
[4483.10 → 4483.56] these governing
[4483.56 → 4484.12] officials,
[4484.38 → 4484.86] these people
[4484.86 → 4485.34] in authority,
[4485.42 → 4485.94] he calls
[4485.94 → 4486.32] them
[4486.32 → 4488.42] in verse
[4488.42 → 4488.82] 4
[4488.82 → 4489.76] God's
[4489.76 → 4490.38] servant
[4490.38 → 4491.68] for your
[4491.68 → 4492.00] good.
[4492.00 → 4493.52] Now the
[4493.52 → 4493.92] word that
[4493.92 → 4494.36] he uses
[4494.36 → 4495.04] for servant
[4495.04 → 4495.64] here is
[4495.64 → 4496.20] particular.
[4496.72 → 4497.16] It's a
[4497.16 → 4497.56] word that
[4497.56 → 4498.02] can also
[4498.02 → 4498.68] mean waiter.
[4499.54 → 4499.74] Right?
[4499.76 → 4500.06] Like a
[4500.06 → 4500.86] server at
[4500.86 → 4501.76] a restaurant.
[4502.38 → 4503.20] It's actually
[4503.20 → 4503.72] the word
[4503.72 → 4504.10] that in
[4504.10 → 4504.48] church
[4504.48 → 4505.20] we get
[4505.20 → 4505.54] the word
[4505.54 → 4505.96] deacon
[4505.96 → 4506.36] from.
[4507.58 → 4507.82] Deacon
[4507.82 → 4508.18] is an
[4508.18 → 4508.70] office of
[4508.70 → 4509.18] the church
[4509.18 → 4510.32] and deacons
[4510.32 → 4510.78] serve,
[4510.90 → 4511.18] one of the
[4511.18 → 4511.54] ways they
[4511.54 → 4512.24] serve is
[4512.24 → 4513.44] to help
[4513.44 → 4514.66] us meet
[4514.66 → 4515.56] the needs
[4515.56 → 4515.98] of one
[4515.98 → 4516.26] another.
[4518.00 → 4518.48] And really
[4518.48 → 4519.10] taking this
[4519.10 → 4519.66] idea and
[4519.66 → 4520.34] connecting it
[4520.34 → 4521.42] to governance
[4521.42 → 4522.56] connecting it
[4522.56 → 4523.34] to authorities
[4523.34 → 4524.20] as being
[4524.20 → 4525.50] servants is
[4525.50 → 4526.04] where we
[4526.04 → 4526.44] get the
[4526.44 → 4527.16] concept of
[4527.16 → 4527.52] servant
[4527.52 → 4528.04] leadership
[4528.04 → 4528.48] from.
[4530.02 → 4530.10] Right?
[4530.18 → 4530.80] Responsible
[4530.80 → 4531.60] governing then
[4531.60 → 4532.56] understands
[4532.56 → 4533.52] that your
[4533.52 → 4534.26] role in
[4534.26 → 4535.36] society is
[4535.36 → 4536.28] to serve.
[4537.88 → 4538.20] Now again,
[4538.26 → 4538.60] this is going
[4538.60 → 4539.20] to fly in
[4539.20 → 4539.68] the face
[4539.68 → 4540.00] of the
[4540.00 → 4540.60] impulse
[4540.60 → 4541.14] of
[4541.14 → 4541.82] authoritarian
[4541.82 → 4542.82] or dictatorial
[4542.82 → 4543.20] rule.
[4543.56 → 4543.64] Right?
[4544.30 → 4545.06] Responsible
[4545.06 → 4545.56] governing
[4545.56 → 4546.84] doesn't seize
[4546.84 → 4547.50] power,
[4547.98 → 4548.54] but instead
[4548.54 → 4549.32] responsible
[4549.32 → 4549.70] governing
[4549.70 → 4550.62] gives up
[4550.62 → 4551.28] power
[4551.28 → 4551.70] for the
[4551.70 → 4552.22] well-being
[4552.22 → 4552.58] of its
[4552.58 → 4553.02] citizens.
[4554.24 → 4554.70] In that
[4554.70 → 4555.02] way,
[4555.14 → 4555.70] responsible
[4555.70 → 4556.40] governments
[4556.40 → 4557.44] actually
[4557.44 → 4558.40] begin to
[4558.40 → 4559.50] model for
[4559.50 → 4559.86] us
[4559.86 → 4560.38] Jesus.
[4561.50 → 4561.74] Right?
[4561.82 → 4562.46] Jesus who
[4562.46 → 4563.56] gave up
[4563.56 → 4564.04] power,
[4564.14 → 4564.52] who didn't
[4564.52 → 4565.36] seize power,
[4565.36 → 4566.22] who emptied
[4566.22 → 4566.94] himself of
[4566.94 → 4567.68] all but love
[4567.68 → 4568.44] and submitted
[4568.44 → 4569.08] himself to
[4569.08 → 4569.90] the authorities
[4569.90 → 4570.92] around him
[4570.92 → 4571.66] in order that
[4571.66 → 4572.74] by his death
[4572.74 → 4573.86] many might
[4573.86 → 4574.40] live.
[4575.86 → 4576.64] That's the
[4576.64 → 4577.44] model of
[4577.44 → 4578.04] responsible
[4578.04 → 4579.06] government.
[4579.06 → 4581.24] God
[4581.24 → 4581.30] Now,
[4581.38 → 4581.64] of course,
[4582.44 → 4582.84] it doesn't
[4582.84 → 4583.44] always happen.
[4584.24 → 4585.12] Jesus isn't
[4585.12 → 4585.60] the model
[4585.60 → 4586.18] for many
[4586.18 → 4587.08] of our
[4587.08 → 4587.48] governing
[4587.48 → 4588.24] authorities.
[4589.38 → 4589.60] And in
[4589.60 → 4589.80] fact,
[4589.96 → 4590.72] many of
[4590.72 → 4590.90] our
[4590.90 → 4591.22] governing
[4591.22 → 4591.90] authorities
[4591.90 → 4593.32] explicitly
[4593.32 → 4594.90] reject
[4594.90 → 4595.94] Jesus.
[4597.10 → 4597.74] But that
[4597.74 → 4598.14] doesn't change
[4598.14 → 4598.40] the fact
[4598.40 → 4598.62] that he
[4598.62 → 4599.22] should be.
[4601.40 → 4602.02] And that
[4602.02 → 4602.28] when we
[4602.28 → 4602.60] hold our
[4602.60 → 4603.02] leaders to
[4603.02 → 4603.36] that kind
[4603.36 → 4603.94] of standard,
[4604.40 → 4605.16] we're saying
[4605.16 → 4605.56] something
[4605.56 → 4606.34] particular to
[4606.34 → 4606.56] them.
[4609.30 → 4610.08] This week,
[4610.14 → 4610.58] I had
[4610.58 → 4610.90] a chance
[4610.90 → 4613.04] to read
[4613.04 → 4614.46] a Christian
[4614.46 → 4616.46] pastor who
[4616.46 → 4617.50] is serving
[4617.50 → 4618.12] a church
[4618.12 → 4619.36] in Iran.
[4620.94 → 4621.82] His name
[4621.82 → 4622.32] is Lima
[4622.32 → 4623.84] Alidade.
[4625.28 → 4626.10] And he
[4626.10 → 4627.34] talks about
[4627.34 → 4628.44] Romans 13
[4628.44 → 4630.34] actually as
[4630.34 → 4630.88] flowing
[4630.88 → 4632.70] directly out
[4632.70 → 4633.38] of the
[4633.38 → 4634.00] previous
[4634.00 → 4635.06] imperative
[4635.06 → 4635.90] in Romans
[4635.90 → 4636.28] 12,
[4636.34 → 4636.90] verse 21.
[4637.54 → 4637.82] So if you
[4637.82 → 4638.00] have your
[4638.00 → 4638.52] Bible open,
[4638.60 → 4639.18] Romans 12,
[4639.26 → 4639.76] verse 21
[4639.76 → 4640.32] says,
[4640.94 → 4641.36] do not
[4641.36 → 4642.08] be overcome
[4642.08 → 4643.16] by evil,
[4643.64 → 4644.46] but overcome
[4644.46 → 4646.54] evil with
[4646.54 → 4647.58] good.
[4649.48 → 4650.32] So here
[4650.32 → 4650.72] you have
[4650.72 → 4651.50] an Iranian
[4651.50 → 4652.48] Christian
[4652.48 → 4654.30] serving in
[4654.30 → 4654.66] a place
[4654.66 → 4654.98] where it
[4654.98 → 4655.76] is illegal
[4655.76 → 4656.72] to be
[4656.72 → 4657.46] Christian,
[4658.36 → 4658.86] arguing
[4658.86 → 4659.72] for the
[4659.72 → 4660.30] importance
[4660.30 → 4661.22] of Romans
[4661.22 → 4662.10] 13 and
[4662.10 → 4662.96] submitting to
[4662.96 → 4663.68] governing
[4663.68 → 4664.46] authorities
[4664.46 → 4664.74] authorities
[4664.74 → 4666.22] and framing
[4666.22 → 4666.96] that in
[4666.96 → 4667.94] the context
[4667.94 → 4668.94] of do not
[4668.94 → 4669.36] be overcome
[4669.36 → 4669.88] by evil,
[4669.98 → 4670.62] but overcome
[4670.62 → 4671.44] evil with
[4671.44 → 4671.80] good.
[4672.16 → 4673.28] He argues
[4673.28 → 4673.64] in his
[4673.64 → 4674.10] writing that
[4674.10 → 4674.84] we should
[4674.84 → 4675.88] expect most
[4675.88 → 4676.66] governments to
[4676.66 → 4677.28] be evil and
[4677.28 → 4677.68] corrupt,
[4677.68 → 4678.50] but our
[4678.50 → 4679.62] humble submission
[4679.62 → 4680.84] to them is
[4680.84 → 4681.34] a sort of
[4681.34 → 4681.82] Christian
[4681.82 → 4683.26] subversion of
[4683.26 → 4683.78] that evil
[4683.78 → 4684.30] authority.
[4686.48 → 4686.90] And so here
[4686.90 → 4688.78] is someone who
[4688.78 → 4689.18] lives in a
[4689.18 → 4691.26] context that
[4691.26 → 4692.44] I have
[4692.44 → 4692.70] never
[4692.70 → 4693.54] experienced
[4693.54 → 4695.64] and yet
[4695.64 → 4696.26] challenges
[4696.26 → 4697.16] me deeply
[4697.16 → 4698.18] in the
[4698.18 → 4698.72] context I
[4698.72 → 4699.20] live in.
[4702.34 → 4702.86] Abraham
[4702.86 → 4703.36] Kuiper
[4703.36 → 4704.62] was a
[4704.62 → 4704.80] Dutch
[4704.80 → 4705.48] theologian
[4705.48 → 4706.68] and politician.
[4706.68 → 4707.02] He was
[4707.02 → 4707.60] prime minister
[4707.60 → 4707.88] of the
[4707.88 → 4708.18] Netherlands
[4708.18 → 4709.54] from 1901
[4709.54 → 4710.54] to 1905.
[4710.66 → 4710.94] For those
[4710.94 → 4711.28] of you with
[4711.28 → 4711.84] ears to hear,
[4711.94 → 4712.38] much of what
[4712.38 → 4712.74] I have been
[4712.74 → 4713.88] saying about
[4713.88 → 4714.80] the governance
[4714.80 → 4715.38] and political
[4715.38 → 4715.94] theory and
[4715.94 → 4716.68] structure comes
[4716.68 → 4717.26] from him.
[4718.38 → 4718.82] And he
[4718.82 → 4719.58] says in a
[4719.58 → 4720.98] lovely mixed
[4720.98 → 4721.42] metaphor,
[4722.70 → 4723.64] the state
[4723.64 → 4724.22] may never
[4724.22 → 4725.00] become an
[4725.00 → 4726.26] octopus which
[4726.26 → 4727.10] stifles the
[4727.10 → 4727.58] whole of
[4727.58 → 4727.94] life.
[4728.42 → 4728.74] It must
[4728.74 → 4729.68] occupy its
[4729.68 → 4730.46] own place
[4730.46 → 4730.98] on its
[4730.98 → 4731.62] own root
[4731.62 → 4732.38] among all
[4732.38 → 4732.78] the other
[4732.78 → 4733.36] trees of
[4733.36 → 4733.88] the forest
[4733.88 → 4734.68] and thus
[4734.68 → 4735.78] it has to
[4735.78 → 4736.40] honour and
[4736.40 → 4737.22] maintain every
[4737.22 → 4737.70] form of
[4737.70 → 4738.42] life which
[4738.42 → 4738.70] grows
[4738.70 → 4739.42] independently
[4739.42 → 4740.08] in its
[4740.08 → 4740.72] own sacred
[4740.72 → 4741.48] autonomy.
[4743.96 → 4744.36] And so you
[4744.36 → 4744.82] see here
[4744.82 → 4745.32] these two
[4745.32 → 4745.80] things.
[4745.80 → 4747.76] The impulse
[4747.76 → 4748.94] of all
[4748.94 → 4749.48] governing
[4749.48 → 4750.12] authority
[4750.12 → 4750.92] because of
[4750.92 → 4751.66] sin is to
[4751.66 → 4752.58] become an
[4752.58 → 4753.42] octopus or
[4753.42 → 4754.40] is to
[4754.40 → 4756.86] present evil
[4756.86 → 4757.78] but our
[4757.78 → 4758.84] response
[4758.84 → 4761.14] as Christian
[4761.14 → 4762.06] citizens and
[4762.06 → 4762.84] as Christians
[4762.84 → 4763.78] in politics
[4763.78 → 4765.02] is to hold
[4765.02 → 4765.80] up the model
[4765.80 → 4766.40] of the Lord
[4766.40 → 4767.30] Jesus Christ.
[4768.14 → 4769.26] Our response
[4769.26 → 4769.86] is to
[4769.86 → 4771.36] properly define
[4771.36 → 4773.32] order and
[4773.32 → 4774.26] our response
[4774.26 → 4775.22] is to
[4775.22 → 4776.40] not be
[4776.40 → 4776.70] overcome
[4776.70 → 4777.48] by evil
[4777.48 → 4778.32] but overcome
[4778.32 → 4779.58] evil with
[4779.58 → 4780.38] good.
[4780.60 → 4781.18] And part
[4781.18 → 4782.02] of how we
[4782.02 → 4782.64] do that
[4782.64 → 4783.82] is showing
[4783.82 → 4785.34] our governments
[4785.34 → 4787.56] this truth.
[4789.48 → 4790.44] Now let's
[4790.44 → 4790.90] pull all these
[4790.90 → 4791.50] things together
[4791.50 → 4792.44] then and
[4792.44 → 4792.86] then let's
[4792.86 → 4794.00] land this
[4794.00 → 4794.62] plane and
[4794.62 → 4795.48] encourage further
[4795.48 → 4795.90] discussion.
[4797.80 → 4798.46] Responsible
[4798.46 → 4799.08] governments
[4799.08 → 4800.48] will understand
[4800.48 → 4801.56] that there is
[4801.56 → 4802.40] a created
[4802.40 → 4803.32] order of which
[4803.32 → 4803.78] they are a
[4803.78 → 4804.02] part.
[4805.06 → 4805.62] Responsible
[4805.62 → 4806.02] governments
[4806.02 → 4806.72] will understand
[4806.72 → 4807.12] that they
[4807.12 → 4807.90] have a
[4807.90 → 4808.42] responsibility
[4808.42 → 4809.46] to punish
[4809.46 → 4810.10] evil and
[4810.10 → 4810.44] to limit
[4810.44 → 4810.94] the effects
[4810.94 → 4811.38] of sin
[4811.38 → 4812.46] and responsible
[4812.46 → 4813.48] governments
[4813.48 → 4814.18] will then
[4814.18 → 4815.22] also understand
[4815.22 → 4816.56] that part
[4816.56 → 4817.06] of what they
[4817.06 → 4817.88] do is to
[4817.88 → 4818.96] commend what
[4818.96 → 4820.22] is right.
[4821.82 → 4822.36] And in
[4822.36 → 4822.86] verse 6
[4822.86 → 4824.56] Paul says
[4824.56 → 4826.14] that these
[4826.14 → 4826.74] authorities
[4826.74 → 4828.10] are God's
[4828.10 → 4828.94] servants.
[4831.30 → 4832.00] Now this
[4832.00 → 4832.26] is a
[4832.26 → 4833.02] different word
[4833.02 → 4833.60] in Greek
[4833.60 → 4833.96] than the
[4833.96 → 4834.22] one he
[4834.22 → 4834.72] used in
[4834.72 → 4835.24] verse 4.
[4836.22 → 4836.98] In verse 4
[4836.98 → 4837.46] he used
[4837.46 → 4837.82] the word
[4837.82 → 4838.10] that we
[4838.10 → 4838.86] know means
[4838.86 → 4839.24] deacon.
[4839.60 → 4840.32] Here the
[4840.32 → 4840.84] word he
[4840.84 → 4842.16] uses is
[4842.16 → 4843.34] liturgy
[4843.34 → 4845.18] which is
[4845.18 → 4845.78] only ever
[4845.78 → 4847.12] used of
[4847.12 → 4847.60] ministers
[4847.60 → 4848.74] and people
[4848.74 → 4849.34] who serve
[4849.34 → 4849.62] in the
[4849.62 → 4849.92] temple.
[4851.36 → 4852.18] It's the
[4852.18 → 4852.94] word that
[4852.94 → 4853.84] we get the
[4853.84 → 4854.42] church word
[4854.42 → 4855.40] liturgist
[4855.40 → 4856.42] or liturgy
[4856.42 → 4856.86] from.
[4857.66 → 4858.24] It's the
[4858.24 → 4858.82] same word
[4858.82 → 4859.32] that Paul
[4859.32 → 4860.00] uses of
[4860.00 → 4860.76] himself in
[4860.76 → 4861.52] Romans 16
[4861.52 → 4862.22] verse 16
[4862.22 → 4863.00] when he
[4863.00 → 4863.74] calls himself
[4863.74 → 4864.54] a minister
[4864.54 → 4865.64] of Christ
[4865.64 → 4866.30] Jesus to
[4866.30 → 4866.96] the Gentiles
[4866.96 → 4867.74] because of
[4867.74 → 4868.38] God's grace.
[4870.26 → 4870.44] And so
[4870.44 → 4870.90] here's what
[4870.90 → 4872.42] I want you
[4872.42 → 4872.94] to hear as
[4872.94 → 4873.62] a last word
[4873.62 → 4874.58] and for our
[4874.58 → 4875.28] political leaders
[4875.28 → 4876.32] to hear as
[4876.32 → 4877.08] a last word.
[4878.14 → 4879.72] This underscores
[4879.72 → 4880.38] the point
[4880.38 → 4881.44] for me that
[4881.44 → 4882.28] even these
[4882.28 → 4883.42] secular pagan
[4883.42 → 4884.24] authorities
[4884.24 → 4885.56] God uses
[4885.56 → 4886.28] as his
[4886.28 → 4886.90] hands and
[4886.90 → 4887.64] feet to
[4887.64 → 4888.40] bring peace
[4888.40 → 4889.12] and order
[4889.12 → 4889.84] and justice
[4889.84 → 4890.52] but it
[4890.52 → 4891.50] also means
[4891.50 → 4893.68] like pastors
[4893.68 → 4895.02] of the church
[4895.02 → 4895.80] like ministers
[4895.80 → 4896.82] of the church
[4896.82 → 4897.86] we will be
[4897.86 → 4898.54] judged more
[4898.54 → 4899.54] harshly if we
[4899.54 → 4900.32] abuse that
[4900.32 → 4900.84] influence
[4900.84 → 4901.60] if we abuse
[4901.60 → 4902.28] that power.
[4903.88 → 4904.56] Governments
[4904.56 → 4905.16] then
[4905.16 → 4906.74] who reject
[4906.74 → 4907.36] God's
[4907.36 → 4907.84] order
[4907.84 → 4909.42] are rejecting
[4909.42 → 4910.38] their purpose
[4910.38 → 4912.14] and they
[4912.14 → 4912.46] will have
[4912.46 → 4912.72] to give
[4912.72 → 4913.12] account
[4913.12 → 4914.40] for that
[4914.40 → 4914.86] rejection.
[4919.30 → 4920.56] If you
[4920.56 → 4921.40] want
[4921.40 → 4922.38] what is
[4922.38 → 4922.92] best
[4922.92 → 4923.72] for human
[4923.72 → 4924.34] flourishing
[4924.34 → 4925.50] in society
[4925.50 → 4926.60] you will
[4926.60 → 4927.52] want to
[4927.52 → 4928.26] hold our
[4928.26 → 4928.68] governments
[4928.68 → 4929.14] to these
[4929.14 → 4929.92] kinds of
[4929.92 → 4930.20] account
[4930.20 → 4930.84] and if you
[4930.84 → 4931.22] are a
[4931.22 → 4931.50] political
[4931.50 → 4931.86] servant
[4931.86 → 4932.34] if you
[4932.34 → 4932.60] want
[4932.60 → 4932.90] what is
[4932.90 → 4933.16] best
[4933.16 → 4934.44] for human
[4934.44 → 4935.00] flourishing
[4935.00 → 4935.34] you
[4935.34 → 4936.14] will
[4936.14 → 4936.92] and ought
[4936.92 → 4937.44] to come
[4937.44 → 4937.80] to the
[4937.80 → 4938.30] word of
[4938.30 → 4938.56] God
[4938.56 → 4939.28] which reveals
[4939.28 → 4939.84] his will
[4939.84 → 4940.50] his design
[4940.50 → 4941.08] his purpose
[4941.08 → 4941.66] his intent
[4941.66 → 4942.38] for our
[4942.38 → 4943.16] shared life
[4943.16 → 4943.62] together
[4943.62 → 4947.60] and so
[4947.60 → 4948.34] as citizens
[4948.34 → 4950.88] and as
[4950.88 → 4951.48] governments
[4951.48 → 4953.40] let's
[4953.40 → 4953.90] together
[4953.90 → 4955.78] be God's
[4955.78 → 4956.68] ministers
[4956.68 → 4958.02] his
[4958.02 → 4959.48] liturgists
[4959.48 → 4961.04] of mercy
[4961.04 → 4962.14] and grace
[4962.14 → 4963.50] and justice
[4963.50 → 4965.20] because
[4965.20 → 4965.70] together
[4965.70 → 4966.38] that is
[4966.38 → 4967.18] what we
[4967.18 → 4967.82] are called
[4967.82 → 4968.48] to be
[4968.48 → 4969.16] and that
[4969.16 → 4969.42] is what
[4969.42 → 4969.66] we are
[4969.66 → 4969.90] called
[4969.90 → 4970.60] to show
[4970.60 → 4971.32] this
[4971.32 → 4972.40] world
[4972.40 → 4974.94] and we
[4974.94 → 4975.36] know
[4975.36 → 4976.70] that
[4976.70 → 4977.68] sharing
[4977.68 → 4978.20] this
[4978.20 → 4978.60] living
[4978.60 → 4979.28] this way
[4979.28 → 4980.10] and being
[4980.10 → 4980.98] God's
[4980.98 → 4982.00] liturgists
[4982.00 → 4982.36] his
[4982.36 → 4983.46] ministers
[4983.46 → 4984.60] for revealing
[4984.60 → 4985.74] his order
[4985.74 → 4987.02] and structure
[4987.02 → 4987.84] to society
[4987.84 → 4988.48] is a
[4988.48 → 4988.96] difficult
[4988.96 → 4989.92] task
[4989.92 → 4990.60] and so
[4990.60 → 4991.08] we are
[4991.08 → 4991.84] so grateful
[4991.84 → 4992.36] to God
[4992.36 → 4992.94] for times
[4992.94 → 4993.46] like this
[4993.46 → 4993.86] where we can
[4993.86 → 4994.46] come together
[4994.46 → 4995.36] at his word
[4995.36 → 4995.96] and for times

[4999.08 → 4999.40] in a moment
[4999.40 → 4999.74] I'm going to
[4999.74 → 5000.00] pray
[5000.00 → 5000.78] and part
[5000.78 → 5001.06] of that
