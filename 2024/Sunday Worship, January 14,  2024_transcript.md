[0.00 --> 9.00]  Every single light it tells me I will never measure love
[13.00 --> 21.00]  Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
[21.00 --> 26.00]  I'm not sure what I'm doing
[26.00 --> 35.00]  Remind me once again just who I am because I need to know
[36.00 --> 44.00]  You say I'm loved when I can't feel a thing
[44.00 --> 50.00]  You say I'm strong when I think I'm weak
[51.00 --> 56.00]  And you say I'm held when I am falling short
[57.00 --> 63.00]  And when I don't belong, oh, you say I'm yours
[63.00 --> 69.00]  And I believe, oh, I believe
[70.00 --> 76.00]  What you say of me, I believe
[77.00 --> 86.00]  The only thing that matters now is everything you think of me
[86.00 --> 93.00]  And I believe, oh, you say I'm loved when I can't feel a thing
[94.00 --> 100.00]  You say I'm strong when I think I'm weak
[101.00 --> 107.00]  You say I'm strong when I think I'm weak
[107.00 --> 108.50]  I can't feel a thing.
[109.50 --> 115.14]  You say I am strong when I think I am weak.
[115.80 --> 121.80]  And you say I am held when I am falling short.
[122.48 --> 124.38]  When I don't belong.
[125.48 --> 128.20]  Oh, you say I am yours.
[129.52 --> 131.40]  And I believe.
[131.62 --> 131.96]  I.
[132.70 --> 134.22]  Oh, I believe.
[134.22 --> 135.36]  I.
[135.36 --> 138.66]  What you say of me.
[139.14 --> 141.54]  Oh, I believe.
[141.96 --> 143.12]  You can see Ooooh.
[143.12 --> 146.04]  telefon attacks in terms of what you said of me.
[146.88 --> 151.34]  Taking all I had it on and leave me.
[151.78 --> 154.90]  And you'll be low.
[154.90 --> 162.82]  You have every failure, God.
[162.82 --> 166.24]  You have every victory.
[170.24 --> 176.74]  You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing.
[177.56 --> 183.22]  You say I am strong when I think I am weak.
[183.22 --> 189.80]  You say I am held when I am falling short.
[190.56 --> 196.44]  When I don't belong, oh, you say I am yours.
[197.48 --> 206.18]  And I believe, oh, I believe what you say of me.
[206.18 --> 212.52]  I believe, oh, I believe.
[212.52 --> 219.60]  Yes, I believe what you say of me.
[219.60 --> 221.94]  I believe, oh, I believe.
[221.94 --> 222.94]  I believe.
[222.94 --> 225.28]  I believe, oh, I believe.
[225.28 --> 230.28]  I believe, oh, I believe.
[230.28 --> 245.62]  I believe, oh, I believe.
[245.62 --> 247.96]  I believe, oh, I believe.
[247.96 --> 248.96]  I believe.
[248.96 --> 252.96]  I believe, oh, I believe.
[252.96 --> 259.30]  I believe, oh, I believe.
[259.30 --> 267.64]  I believe.
[268.02 --> 271.64]  Oh, I believe.
[271.64 --> 273.64]  Do it or anything.
[294.64 --> 296.64]  Woo- sheep!
[301.64 --> 307.64]  I keep setting up your love forever
[309.64 --> 310.64]  I'm never
[314.64 --> 317.64]  I'm never
[322.64 --> 324.64]  All the mountains on the sea
[325.64 --> 327.64]  The river runs with a light for me
[327.64 --> 330.64]  And I will open up my heart
[330.64 --> 332.64]  I'll never heal us and breathe
[332.64 --> 335.64]  I'm happy to be in the truth
[335.64 --> 338.64]  And I will tell you my hands
[338.64 --> 340.64]  For I will always sing
[340.64 --> 343.64]  And when your love can die
[343.64 --> 348.64]  I could sing of your love forever
[348.64 --> 354.64]  I could sing of your love forever
[354.64 --> 357.64]  quarterback
[357.64 --> 358.64]  To Charlotte
[359.64 --> 361.64]  I can sing of your love forever
[361.64 --> 363.64]  I could sing of your love forever
[364.64 --> 368.64]  I could sing of your love forever
[368.64 --> 371.64]  I could sing of your love forever
[371.64 --> 373.64]  I could sing of your love forever
[373.64 --> 378.64]  But I believe I could sing of your love
[378.64 --> 384.64]  So I wish I could sing of your love
[384.64 --> 391.64]  Oh, I feel like dancing, yeah, yeah
[391.64 --> 394.64]  It's foolishness, I know
[394.64 --> 399.64]  But when the world is in night
[399.64 --> 406.64]  They will dance with joy like we're dancing now
[406.64 --> 409.64]  I can sing of your love
[409.64 --> 412.64]  I can sing of your love
[412.64 --> 417.64]  I can sing of your love forever
[417.64 --> 420.64]  I can sing of your love
[420.64 --> 427.64]  I can sing of your love forever
[427.64 --> 432.64]  I will sing of your love forever
[432.64 --> 436.64]  I can sing of your love forever
[436.64 --> 439.64]  I lift the hands of the praise of all my name
[439.64 --> 444.64]  I will sing of your love forever
[444.64 --> 449.64]  I will sing of your love
[449.64 --> 454.64]  I will sing of your love forever
[454.64 --> 458.64]  I can sing of your love forever
[458.64 --> 462.64]  I can sing of your love forever
[462.64 --> 465.64]  I will sing of your love forever
[465.64 --> 471.64]  I will sing of your love forever
[471.64 --> 473.64]  I will sing of your love forever
[473.64 --> 475.64]  I can sing of your love forever
[475.64 --> 477.64]  I can sing of your love forever
[477.64 --> 479.64]  I will sing of your love forever
[479.64 --> 484.64]  I can sing under love forever.
[485.64 --> 489.64]  I can sing under love forever.
[491.64 --> 495.64]  I can sing under love forever.
[509.64 --> 512.64]  I can sing under love forever.
[513.64 --> 515.64]  She's being lost.
[539.64 --> 541.64]  Good morning.
[541.64 --> 542.64]  Good morning.
[542.64 --> 548.64]  I know it's cold and I know we're a small group this morning, but I'm sure you can do better than that.
[548.64 --> 550.64]  Maybe it's not my fault.
[552.64 --> 554.64]  How about now?
[554.64 --> 555.64]  There we go.
[555.64 --> 560.64]  Okay, my apologies for assuming it was your fault and not mine.
[561.64 --> 562.64]  Good morning.
[563.64 --> 564.64]  Wonderful.
[564.64 --> 570.64]  Thank you for coming together and joining with us to worship God this morning.
[570.64 --> 571.64]  My name is Chris.
[571.64 --> 574.64]  I'm one of the pastors here at Langley Manual.
[574.64 --> 579.64]  If you're a guest with us, we are particularly glad that you are here and we would love to connect with you.
[580.64 --> 582.64]  You can find me after the service.
[582.64 --> 588.64]  I'll be at the back near the Connect booth, which is that table back there that has the big sign on it that says Connect.
[589.64 --> 591.64]  Someone asked me the other day, what's the Connect booth?
[591.64 --> 594.64]  I thought it was self-explanatory.
[594.64 --> 596.64]  Apparently, we have to explain more.
[597.64 --> 598.64]  It's that table back there.
[598.64 --> 599.64]  You can find me there.
[600.64 --> 601.64]  We have a couple announcements before we begin.
[602.64 --> 603.64]  Leanne, why don't you start walking up?
[605.64 --> 608.64]  Leanne is going to make an announcement on behalf of Women's Ministry.
[609.64 --> 612.64]  While she's making her way over there, I just wanted to remind you.
[613.64 --> 614.64]  Over there is a microphone. Thank you.
[615.64 --> 618.64]  For youth, youth coffee is today after service.
[619.64 --> 620.64]  I lied.
[620.64 --> 621.64]  He's bringing it to you.
[622.64 --> 623.64]  We're piecing it together.
[624.64 --> 625.64]  New year, new problems.
[626.64 --> 628.64]  Youth coffee is after service today.
[629.64 --> 632.64]  That's for those of you involved in our youth program.
[633.64 --> 635.64]  That's happening at Paul and Leslie Kuhl's house.
[636.64 --> 637.64]  Paul and Leslie Kuhl, there they are.
[638.64 --> 642.64]  If you have any questions, you can talk to them or Pastor Kevin and he will get you directions for that.
[642.64 --> 646.64]  That's after service this morning for lunch and hanging out together.
[647.64 --> 648.64]  Go ahead.
[648.64 --> 651.64]  Good morning. As Chris said, this is on behalf of the Women's Ministry.
[651.64 --> 655.64]  We want to invite the women of our church to join us at a women's retreat.
[655.64 --> 659.64]  We'll be having a retreat March 8th to 10th at Camp Kakawa in Hope.
[660.64 --> 663.64]  The cost will be $185 for the weekend.
[664.64 --> 666.64]  If you have questions, thank you for mentioning the Connect booth.
[667.64 --> 669.64]  You can come speak to any of us at the back Connect counter.
[669.64 --> 671.64]  If you'd like to register, same thing, meet us over there.
[672.64 --> 675.64]  You can register there or you can follow the link that is in the bulletin.
[676.64 --> 680.64]  Once you have done that initial registration, we'll send you out a full registration package.
[681.64 --> 684.64]  The deadline to register will be February 8th.
[685.64 --> 687.64]  The deadline to pay will be February 16th.
[688.64 --> 690.64]  If you have questions, please come see us at the Connect booth.
[690.64 --> 691.64]  We hope to see you at the retreat though.
[695.64 --> 697.64]  And one last announcement.
[697.64 --> 702.64]  If you were here, you may have seen it on the scrolling announcements before service.
[703.64 --> 708.64]  But on January 28th at 6pm, so that's Sunday night, 6pm,
[709.64 --> 711.64]  we're hosting another worship gathering.
[712.64 --> 715.64]  We have been gathering in the evenings to sing praise to God
[716.64 --> 718.64]  and we've been doing that through particular themes.
[719.64 --> 723.64]  January 28th, we are hosting what is being called Worship Through the Decades.
[723.64 --> 736.64]  And so starting in the 70s and up until present, we will sing some of your favorites and remembered worship songs through those eras.
[736.64 --> 738.64]  And so we encourage you to block that out.
[739.64 --> 740.64]  Keep that on your calendar.
[740.64 --> 743.64]  Save the date and join us January 28th at 6pm.
[743.64 --> 744.64]  I think that's it for announcements.
[744.64 --> 752.64]  And so if you are able and where you are, please stand and we'll receive God's greeting together.
[752.64 --> 764.64]  Following God's greeting, you are invited to turn to those around you and welcome them into worship.
[764.64 --> 772.64]  As we are in cold and flu season, just be mindful that sometimes a head nod is okay and words are always welcome.
[773.64 --> 775.64]  So, receive the greeting of our God.
[776.64 --> 784.64]  Grace, mercy and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[785.64 --> 787.64]  All God's people said, Amen.
[787.64 --> 800.64]  P
[800.64 --> 802.64] 's
[817.64 --> 826.84]  God calls us all to worship him this morning with the words of Psalm 107.
[827.18 --> 829.44]  He sent out his word and healed them.
[829.54 --> 831.14]  He rescued them from the grave.
[831.62 --> 834.60]  Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love
[834.60 --> 837.96]  and let his wonderful deeds for all mankind.
[837.96 --> 843.86]  Let them sacrifice, thank offerings, and tell of his works with songs of joy.
[847.64 --> 870.26]  Come, people of the risen King, who delight to bring him praise.
[870.26 --> 878.68]  Come all and tune your hearts to sing to the morning star of grace.
[878.88 --> 886.26]  From the shifting shadows of the earth we will lift our eyes to him.
[887.60 --> 895.14]  Where steady arms of mercy reach to gather children in.
[895.14 --> 904.28]  Rejoice, rejoice, let every tongue rejoice.
[904.66 --> 908.14]  One heart, one voice.
[908.92 --> 911.90]  O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[911.90 --> 918.90]  Come, people of the risen King, who delight to bring him praise.
[918.90 --> 927.10]  Come, those whose joy is morning sun and those weeping through the night.
[927.10 --> 935.68]  Come, those who tell the battle's fall and those struggling in the fight.
[935.68 --> 965.66]  Come, those who tell the Lord, who delight to bring him praise.
[965.66 --> 969.66]  O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[969.66 --> 970.66]  O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[970.66 --> 972.66]  O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[972.66 --> 983.66]  Come, young and old from every land and in the land of the faith.
[983.66 --> 992.66]  Come, those with full or empty hands find the riches of his grace.
[992.66 --> 996.66]  Over all the world, his people sing.
[996.66 --> 1000.66]  Short to shore, we hear them call.
[1000.66 --> 1005.66]  The truth that cries through every age.
[1005.66 --> 1009.66]  Our God is all in all.
[1009.66 --> 1011.66]  Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice.
[1011.66 --> 1013.66]  Rejoice, rejoice.
[1013.66 --> 1014.66]  Rejoice, rejoice.
[1014.66 --> 1017.66]  Let every tongue rejoice.
[1017.66 --> 1021.66]  One heart, one voice.
[1021.66 --> 1024.66]  O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[1024.66 --> 1025.66]  Rejoice, rejoice.
[1025.66 --> 1030.66]  Rejoice, rejoice.
[1030.66 --> 1031.66]  Let every tongue rejoice.
[1031.66 --> 1034.66]  Let every tongue rejoice.
[1034.66 --> 1038.66]  One heart, one voice.
[1038.66 --> 1043.66]  O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[1043.66 --> 1044.66]  O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[1044.66 --> 1047.66]  O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[1047.66 --> 1049.66]  O Church of Christ, rejoice.
[1049.66 --> 1050.66]  Amen.
[1079.66 --> 1107.98]  Holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee.
[1109.66 --> 1138.92]  Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty, all in three persons, blessed Trinity.
[1139.66 --> 1161.66]  Holy, holy, holy, all the saints adore Thee.
[1161.66 --> 1176.66]  Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea.
[1176.66 --> 1192.66]  Cherubim and seraphim, falling down before Thee.
[1192.66 --> 1207.66]  Who words and heart and evermore shall be.
[1207.66 --> 1223.66]  Holy, holy, holy, though the darkness blind Thee.
[1223.66 --> 1237.66]  Though Thee I may find myself, Thy glory may not see.
[1237.66 --> 1253.66]  Only Thou art holy, there is none beside Thee.
[1253.66 --> 1266.88]  Perfect in power, in love and purity.
[1266.88 --> 1267.88]  Amen.
[1267.88 --> 1268.88]  In love and purity.
[1268.88 --> 1269.88]  Amen.
[1269.88 --> 1271.88]  God Almighty has a world meanwhile to the이식 of the Michael song.
[1271.88 --> 1272.88]  Amen.
[1272.88 --> 1301.88]  I bow before Thee
[1302.88 --> 1312.08]  King of glory, holy are You, Lord
[1312.08 --> 1316.88]  None beside Thee

[1417.88 --> 1425.88]  Holy, holy, holy

[1492.88 --> 1497.88]  King of glory
[1497.88 --> 1499.88]  King of glory
[1499.88 --> 1500.88]  King of glory
[1500.88 --> 1502.88]  Holy are You, Lord

[1522.88 --> 1525.88]  You were and are and You will be
[1525.88 --> 1534.88]  You were and are and You will be
[1534.88 --> 1553.88]  You were and are and You will be
[1553.88 --> 1561.88]  You may have a seat.
[1561.88 --> 1563.88]  Please join me in our prayer of confession this morning.
[1563.88 --> 1573.88]  Father, we come to You this morning knowing that we enter into Your holy presence.
[1573.88 --> 1580.88]  We confess all those things that we said or did this week that were not what You called us to do.
[1580.88 --> 1583.88]  Have mercy on us, O God.
[1583.88 --> 1592.88]  Remind us again of who You call us to be and forgive us for those times when we don't show Your love to others through our actions.
[1592.88 --> 1597.88]  You are a forgiving God who delights in us.
[1597.88 --> 1602.88]  Thank You for Your mercy, Your grace, and Your love.
[1602.88 --> 1604.88]  Amen.
[1604.88 --> 1611.88]  Our assurance comes from Romans chapter 6, verse 8 to 11.
[1611.88 --> 1616.88]  Now, if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him.
[1616.88 --> 1622.88]  For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, He cannot die again.
[1622.88 --> 1626.88]  Death no longer has mastery over Him.
[1626.88 --> 1631.88]  The death He died, He died to sin once for all.
[1631.88 --> 1635.88]  But the life He lives, He lives to God.
[1635.88 --> 1643.88]  In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.
[1643.88 --> 1644.88]  Amen.
[1644.88 --> 1645.88]  Amen.
[1645.88 --> 1660.88]  When I fear my faith will fail, Christ will hold me fast.
[1660.88 --> 1667.46]  My faith will fail, Christ will hold me fast.
[1667.46 --> 1676.30]  When the tempter would prevail, he will hold me fast.
[1676.82 --> 1685.34]  I could never keep my hold through life's fearful path,
[1685.80 --> 1689.80]  for my love is often cold.
[1689.80 --> 1694.78]  He must hold me fast.
[1695.78 --> 1700.58]  He will hold me fast.
[1700.82 --> 1704.62]  He will hold me fast.
[1704.88 --> 1708.92]  For my Savior loves me so.
[1710.22 --> 1714.32]  He will hold me fast.
[1719.80 --> 1727.78]  Those he saves are his delight.
[1728.78 --> 1731.78]  Christ will hold me fast.
[1731.78 --> 1740.78]  Precious in his holy sight, he will hold me fast.
[1740.78 --> 1745.76]  He'll not let my soul be lost.
[1745.76 --> 1749.76]  His promises shall last.
[1749.76 --> 1759.76]  For by him at such a cost, he will hold me fast.
[1759.76 --> 1764.74]  He will hold me fast.
[1764.74 --> 1768.74]  He will hold me fast.
[1768.74 --> 1772.74]  For my Savior loves me so.
[1772.74 --> 1778.74]  He will hold me fast.
[1778.74 --> 1791.72]  For my life he bled and died.
[1791.72 --> 1792.72]  Christ will hold me fast.
[1792.72 --> 1796.70]  Christ will hold me fast.
[1796.70 --> 1797.70]  Christ will hold me fast.
[1797.70 --> 1798.70]  Christ will hold me fast.
[1798.70 --> 1803.70]  Christ will hold me fast.
[1803.70 --> 1808.70]  raised with him to endless life.
[1808.70 --> 1810.70]  He will hold me fast.
[1810.70 --> 1812.70]  He will hold me fast.
[1812.70 --> 1819.70]  Till our faith is turned to die.
[1819.70 --> 1823.70]  When he comes at last.
[1823.70 --> 1827.70]  He will hold me fast.
[1827.70 --> 1831.70]  He will hold me fast.
[1831.70 --> 1835.70]  For my Savior loves me so.
[1835.70 --> 1851.70]  He will hold me fast.
[1851.70 --> 1856.70]  For my Savior loves me so.
[1856.70 --> 1860.70]  He will hold me fast.
[1860.70 --> 1873.70]  Please join us for the next song in singing Gracious Redeemer.
[1873.70 --> 1893.70]  I was lost in sin.
[1893.70 --> 1896.70]  Held captive by my fear.
[1896.70 --> 1899.70]  Till your mercy showed.
[1899.70 --> 1902.70]  Your hand was reaching near.
[1902.70 --> 1904.70]  My God you came.
[1904.70 --> 1906.70]  My God you came.
[1906.70 --> 1909.70]  And made a way for me.
[1909.70 --> 1914.70]  You made a way for me.
[1914.70 --> 1919.70]  I was lost in sin.
[1919.70 --> 1922.70]  Held captive by my fear.
[1922.70 --> 1925.70]  Till your mercy showed.
[1925.70 --> 1928.70]  Your hand was reaching near.
[1928.70 --> 1930.70]  My God you came.
[1930.70 --> 1932.70]  My God you came.
[1932.70 --> 1935.70]  And made a way for me.
[1935.70 --> 1938.70]  You made a way for me.
[1938.70 --> 1940.70]  My Jesus.
[1940.70 --> 1943.70]  Gracious Redeemer and friend.
[1943.70 --> 1948.70]  There's nothing like your love without end.
[1948.70 --> 1955.70]  There's nothing like your love without end.
[1955.70 --> 1961.70]  My hope was purchased by the blood of the Lamb.
[1961.70 --> 1969.70]  My Jesus Redeemer.
[1969.70 --> 1985.70]  the heart of the Lamb.
[1985.70 --> 1991.70]  That made a way for me.
[1991.70 --> 2005.70]  coming back again oh god you came and made a way for us you made a way for us
[2006.66 --> 2016.74]  my jesus gracious redeemer and friend there's nothing like your love without end
[2016.74 --> 2030.74]  my hope was purchased by the blood of the man my jesus redeemer
[2030.74 --> 2058.74]  no guilt no shame no curse no chains new life you gave redeemer
[2058.74 --> 2070.74]  no guilt no shame no curse no chains new life you gave redeemer

[2235.58 --> 2241.92]  social media outreach, and they have about 300,000 followers across the Twitter and Facebook pages
[2241.92 --> 2248.76]  for their six ministry programs in the English language alone. These programs focus on different
[2248.76 --> 2255.12]  areas, family life, Christian living and thinking, church resources, a kid's corner, and something
[2255.12 --> 2260.86]  many of us are familiar with, the Today devotional booklet. This is a daily devotional that helps
[2260.86 --> 2268.14]  people refresh, refocus, and renew their faith. You can get the Today in print, on the web, as a mobile
[2268.14 --> 2275.90]  app, or via email. A two-minute audio version of the Today is also available. As part of their mission
[2275.90 --> 2280.50]  to share the gospel, disciple believers, and strengthen the church at home and abroad,
[2280.50 --> 2287.54]  Reframe Ministries have made these useful resources available for everyone in a variety of formats
[2287.54 --> 2294.38]  and languages. As God has blessed us, let us give to support the telling of God's story throughout our world.
[2294.38 --> 2303.74]  people hear the sea, church gladly Lopez Lopez Systemséntron with Mark
[2303.74 --> 2320.30]  Catholic Ogrmond
[2320.30 --> 2329.12]  O God, you search me and you know me
[2329.12 --> 2335.66]  All my thoughts, my hope and to your gaze
[2335.66 --> 2342.26]  When I walk or lie down, you are before me
[2342.26 --> 2349.04]  Ever the maker and keeper of my days
[2349.04 --> 2354.64]  You know my resting and my rising
[2354.64 --> 2362.06]  You discern my purpose from afar
[2362.06 --> 2368.42]  And with love everlasting you beseech me
[2368.42 --> 2374.98]  In every moment of life or death you are
[2374.98 --> 2382.30]  Before a word is on my tongue, Lord
[2382.30 --> 2388.00]  You have known its meaning through and through
[2388.00 --> 2394.34]  You are with me beyond my understanding
[2394.34 --> 2401.00]  God of my present, my past and future too
[2401.00 --> 2408.32]  For you created and shaped me
[2408.32 --> 2414.52]  Gave me life within my mother's womb
[2414.52 --> 2421.32]  For the wonder of who I am I praise you
[2421.32 --> 2427.64]  Safe in your hands, all creation is renewed
[2427.64 --> 2436.58]  O God, you search me and you know me
[2436.58 --> 2442.64]  All my thoughts lie open to your gaze

[2479.56 --> 2484.56]  And then we'll head off to our Children's Worship Time classes
[2484.56 --> 2502.14]  All right, good morning everybody
[2502.14 --> 2508.88]  Today I want to talk about a story that I'm hoping that you are familiar with
[2508.88 --> 2512.88]  It's called The Three Little Pigs
[2512.88 --> 2514.20]  Does anybody know that story?
[2514.20 --> 2515.20]  Yes!
[2515.20 --> 2516.20]  Yes? All right, excellent
[2516.20 --> 2518.20]  And a different variation
[2518.20 --> 2521.20]  Oh, well let's talk about the regular variation
[2521.20 --> 2524.20]  So you don't ruin my plan here, Malachi
[2524.20 --> 2527.48]  What happens in The Three Little Pigs?
[2527.48 --> 2529.40]  Who are some of the characters in there?
[2529.40 --> 2531.20]  It's the big, bad wolf
[2531.20 --> 2532.20]  Sorry?
[2532.20 --> 2534.20]  The big, bad wolf
[2534.20 --> 2536.20]  Who else, Haley?
[2536.20 --> 2537.20]  The Three Little Pigs
[2537.20 --> 2538.20]  And The Three Little Pigs
[2538.20 --> 2540.20]  Those are kind of the main ones, right?
[2540.20 --> 2541.20]  Do you know another one, Malachi?
[2541.20 --> 2542.20]  The Pig's Mom
[2542.20 --> 2543.20]  The Pig's Mom
[2543.20 --> 2545.20]  Maybe there's a Pig's Mom in there
[2545.20 --> 2547.20]  And what happens is
[2547.20 --> 2549.20]  The Big Bad Wolf, he wants to
[2549.20 --> 2551.20]  Eat them
[2551.20 --> 2552.20]  And so what does he do?
[2552.20 --> 2554.20]  He goes to the first pig's house
[2554.20 --> 2556.20]  And he says something like
[2556.20 --> 2557.20]  Let me in
[2557.20 --> 2558.20]  Let me in
[2558.20 --> 2559.20]  Yeah, exactly
[2559.20 --> 2562.20]  Little pig, little pig, let me come in
[2562.20 --> 2563.20]  Yeah, because he's a little bit hungry
[2563.20 --> 2565.20]  And then what does he do to the pig's house?
[2565.20 --> 2566.20]  He blows it down
[2566.20 --> 2567.20]  He blows it down
[2567.20 --> 2570.20]  And then he goes to the next pig's house
[2570.20 --> 2572.20]  And does he do the same thing or something different?
[2572.20 --> 2573.20]  Same thing
[2573.20 --> 2574.20]  He does the same thing
[2574.20 --> 2576.20]  And then he goes to the third pig's house
[2576.20 --> 2578.20]  He blows down
[2578.20 --> 2580.20]  And he tries to blow it down, but he can't
[2580.20 --> 2581.20]  So then what does he do?
[2581.20 --> 2584.20]  He climbs into the chimney
[2584.20 --> 2586.20]  He climbs into the chimney
[2586.20 --> 2588.20]  And then they light a fire
[2588.20 --> 2589.20]  He lands in the soup
[2589.20 --> 2590.20]  Why?
[2590.20 --> 2591.20]  He lands in the house
[2591.20 --> 2592.20]  Yes
[2592.20 --> 2594.20]  Okay, but I'm going to tell you that
[2594.20 --> 2596.20]  That's not the
[2596.20 --> 2598.20]  That's not actually not what the ending is
[2598.20 --> 2600.20]  That's not the ending
[2600.20 --> 2603.20]  This three little pigs has a different ending
[2603.20 --> 2605.20]  So he doesn't have to go in the chimney
[2605.20 --> 2606.20]  He doesn't have to climb down
[2606.20 --> 2608.20]  And fall into the soup
[2608.20 --> 2610.20]  Instead, when he comes to the door and he says
[2610.20 --> 2612.20]  Little pig, little pig, let me come in
[2612.20 --> 2614.20]  And the third little pig says
[2614.20 --> 2616.20]  Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin
[2616.20 --> 2617.20]  And then he says
[2617.20 --> 2618.20]  And I'll huff and I'll puff
[2618.20 --> 2620.20]  And I'll blow your house down
[2620.20 --> 2621.20]  And the third little pig says
[2621.20 --> 2623.20]  Before you do that, let me just tell you
[2623.20 --> 2625.20]  Did that work last time?
[2625.20 --> 2626.20]  Yes
[2626.20 --> 2628.20]  Do you think that's going to work this time?
[2628.20 --> 2630.20]  Look at how strong my house is
[2630.20 --> 2631.20]  And the wolf went
[2631.20 --> 2632.20]  Hmm, that's true
[2632.20 --> 2634.20]  It is made out of bricks
[2634.20 --> 2635.20]  And he said
[2635.20 --> 2637.20]  I have a better way for you to get some food
[2637.20 --> 2639.20]  Because I'm making some delicious soup
[2639.20 --> 2641.20]  Already on my stove
[2641.20 --> 2642.20]  If you come in
[2642.20 --> 2645.20]  I'll teach you how to make a delicious vegetable soup
[2645.20 --> 2646.20]  That you will love
[2646.20 --> 2649.20]  And you won't need to go and blow anybody's house down
[2649.20 --> 2651.20]  Because you can make your own soup
[2652.20 --> 2654.20]  That's the ending
[2657.20 --> 2658.20]  That's the ending of the story
[2658.20 --> 2659.20]  Did that surprise you?
[2659.20 --> 2662.20]  Was that different when what you thought happened?
[2662.20 --> 2663.20]  Yeah, well
[2663.20 --> 2664.20]  Yeah, well
[2665.20 --> 2666.20]  And do you think that maybe
[2666.20 --> 2668.20]  I think that maybe that's a better ending
[2668.20 --> 2670.20]  Because he doesn't need to keep hunting more pigs
[2670.20 --> 2673.20]  He can just make his own delicious food by himself
[2673.20 --> 2677.20]  So the third little pig actually did something really amazing
[2677.20 --> 2678.20]  When he helped his enemy
[2678.20 --> 2681.20]  And he taught him a new way to live
[2681.20 --> 2683.20]  So that he could not be so mean to others
[2684.20 --> 2689.20]  So that story is kind of like something that we are going to learn about from the Bible
[2689.20 --> 2690.20]  Believe it or not
[2690.20 --> 2693.20]  We are going to learn today about how God's kingdom
[2693.20 --> 2694.20]  And what Jesus
[2694.20 --> 2696.20]  The kingdom Jesus wanted to bring
[2696.20 --> 2697.20]  Was very, very different
[2697.20 --> 2700.20]  Than what the Israelites and the people thought
[2701.20 --> 2702.20]  And how they were surprised
[2702.20 --> 2704.20]  About what the ending was going to be
[2705.20 --> 2707.20]  So we can take a stand
[2707.20 --> 2708.20]  Take a stand
[2709.20 --> 2710.20]  Everybody
[2713.20 --> 2715.20]  And we are going to lead the blessing
[2715.20 --> 2717.20]  So if you are learning it
[2717.20 --> 2718.20]  The kids, we go
[2718.20 --> 2719.20]  And we know the Lord be with you
[2719.20 --> 2720.20]  And you get to respond
[2720.20 --> 2721.20]  And also with you
[2721.20 --> 2722.20]  And also with you
[2723.20 --> 2725.20]  The world be with you
[2725.20 --> 2726.20]  All right
[2727.20 --> 2728.20]  The world be with you
[2728.20 --> 2731.20]  And also with you
[2734.20 --> 2737.20]  I've got this morning to head to us
[2737.20 --> 2739.20]  Good morning everyone
[2739.20 --> 2740.20]  Happy New Year
[2740.20 --> 2741.20]  Am I still allowed to say that?
[2741.20 --> 2742.20]  Yeah
[2742.20 --> 2743.20]  Okay, okay
[2743.20 --> 2744.20]  At least until the end of the month maybe
[2744.20 --> 2745.20]  My name is Eric, I'm an elder here and I'm here to lead you in the church family prayer
[2745.20 --> 2747.20]  I have a few things I'd like to mention before that
[2747.20 --> 2748.20]  I have a few things I'd like to mention before that
[2748.20 --> 2751.20]  I got desperate this morning, couldn't find glasses so I got a one-armed glasses here this morning
[2751.20 --> 2755.20]  I'm here to lead you in the church family prayer
[2755.20 --> 2759.20]  I have a few things I'd like to mention before that
[2759.20 --> 2766.20]  I got desperate this morning, couldn't find glasses so I got a one-armed glasses here this morning so I look a little crooked maybe
[2766.20 --> 2767.20]  But they work
[2767.20 --> 2771.20]  A couple things I want to bring to everybody's attention
[2771.20 --> 2773.20]  Just a thing of, thing of Thanksgiving, Megan and Jesus Hernandez had a baby girl named Janica this week
[2774.20 --> 2775.20]  So we're thankful for that
[2776.20 --> 2778.20]  I found out this morning from Frank and Frank and Sylvia that they have a new granddaughter
[2778.20 --> 2781.20]  And they're going to be a new granddaughter
[2781.20 --> 2782.20]  And I have a few things I'd like to mention before that
[2783.20 --> 2793.20]  I got desperate this morning and couldn't find glasses so I got a one-arm glasses here this morning
[2794.20 --> 2795.20]  So I look a little crooked maybe
[2796.20 --> 2797.20]  But they work
[2797.20 --> 2801.24]  I found out this morning from Frank and Sylvia that they have a new granddaughter.
[2802.10 --> 2803.74]  She was born on January 5th.
[2803.92 --> 2808.06]  She's a month early, but the mom and everyone is doing well.
[2808.14 --> 2812.66]  Her name is Charlotte Beth to their daughter Cheryl and Kevin.
[2815.02 --> 2820.14]  We also have a few deaths that have been happening in our community over the last little while
[2820.14 --> 2822.36]  that we should pray for the families for.
[2822.36 --> 2829.90]  Jacob Prins passed away in Lacombe, a connection to the Birken Pass and Prins families in this church.
[2830.96 --> 2835.06]  Ebel Campen, uncle to Miriam De Winter, has passed away.
[2835.80 --> 2840.42]  Hank Van Eyck passed away, dad to Greta Kuypers and granddaughter to Nikki Lowbert.
[2841.40 --> 2845.46]  Helen Van Vergeyck's mom, Carolyn's grandma, also has passed away.
[2845.46 --> 2853.96]  And we should also keep in our minds the Visser and Hummelman families as they've also lost loved ones recently as well.
[2856.16 --> 2859.10]  I saw Emmett in here. Is he still here or did he go to Sunday school?
[2859.84 --> 2861.04]  That's a pretty good sign.
[2861.14 --> 2866.62]  So Emmett was in the hospital for a few days last week, so he's back home and doing well.
[2867.34 --> 2867.58]  Good.
[2868.36 --> 2874.34]  And of course, we've been praying for Jerry Jansen's granddaughter who's dealing with lupus as well for the last few weeks.
[2874.34 --> 2875.40]  So keep her in our prayers.
[2876.46 --> 2878.42]  Now please join me in family prayer.
[2880.48 --> 2882.66]  Heavenly Father, we thank you for this day.
[2883.90 --> 2889.98]  As the cold snap works to pass on to somewhere else, we are thankful for the many comforts we have in our lives,
[2890.04 --> 2891.80]  like heated homes and heated cars.
[2892.82 --> 2896.60]  Our thoughts and prayers go out to those who do not have these conveniences,
[2896.78 --> 2899.72]  like the homeless that we see on the streets, even here in Langley.
[2899.72 --> 2911.36]  As we watch the world spiral into chaos in many areas, we realize how insignificant our complaints about the weather or the cold really are,
[2911.94 --> 2916.76]  compared to the trials that many have in these unstable areas of the world.
[2916.76 --> 2925.00]  We pray for peace in these areas and for your guiding hand for the leadership involved to make peace and harmony accessible to all.
[2925.00 --> 2930.58]  Here in our own country, Lord, we ask for prayer for the challenges we see all too often.
[2930.58 --> 2936.46]  Homelessness, drug addiction, and poverty are big problems that have no easy answers,
[2936.46 --> 2940.76]  but we know, Lord, that no problem is too large for your power to correct.
[2941.86 --> 2948.50]  Lord, give us the leadership in this country, give the leadership in this country the foresight to bring a solution to these issues
[2948.50 --> 2950.48]  and to support those that need our help.
[2950.48 --> 2957.12]  Lord, here in our own church, here at Emmanuel, we have concerns too that we want to bring to you.
[2957.62 --> 2960.84]  So many in our midst have experienced death of a loved one recently.
[2960.84 --> 2968.30]  It is always difficult to lose a loved one, and that hole that is present from the lost can take a long time to heal.
[2969.14 --> 2973.16]  So, Lord, we ask for strength for those who are mourning our loved ones.
[2974.78 --> 2978.90]  We are grateful, Lord, for the new child that has been born to Megan and Jesus Hernandez.
[2978.90 --> 2983.76]  All are doing well, and we are enjoying the smile on Oma Joanne's face.
[2984.76 --> 2991.72]  We also want to praise you, Lord, for the safe arrival of Frank and Sylvia's granddaughter, Charlotte, as well.
[2993.00 --> 2999.10]  We are thankful that Emmett Wind has returned home from the hospital after a health scare that kept him in the hospital for a number of days.
[3000.88 --> 3006.36]  We know, Lord, that there are many challenges, issues, and concerns among our community that do not make the bulletin list.
[3006.36 --> 3013.74]  Many of those we know will all suffer from many physical health ailments that we ask you, Lord, for healing.
[3014.88 --> 3025.86]  The often unseen challenges of mental health are often very difficult to navigate, but we trust and pray that you can offer hope for those and offer light in an often very dark space.
[3025.86 --> 3033.04]  We pray for families in our midst, Lord, where parents need wisdom and strength to deal with the parenting children of all ages.
[3034.26 --> 3039.02]  There's no handbook on this, and we often wonder and hope and pray that we are doing the right things.
[3040.30 --> 3048.84]  Since we know we as parents and our children are your children, we can rest in the comfort that we can trust in you to guide all of us.
[3048.84 --> 3055.48]  In this world, Lord, where there are so many distractions from you and walking with you,
[3056.80 --> 3064.28]  distractions from you and walking with you, we ask for your spirit to encourage us to pause and take a moment to focus on you through a time of prayer,
[3065.22 --> 3067.42]  devotion, Bible reading, or reflection.
[3068.70 --> 3070.50]  This will do us all a lot of good.
[3070.50 --> 3076.90]  When we look around us and see how complicated our world has become and how many distractions there are,
[3077.00 --> 3079.44]  we are grateful for the simple words of the Lord's Prayer.
[3080.56 --> 3084.00]  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[3084.82 --> 3088.38]  Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
[3089.28 --> 3095.22]  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespassers as we forgive those who trespass against us.
[3095.22 --> 3098.50]  And lead us not in temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[3098.80 --> 3102.80]  For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours forever and ever.
[3103.26 --> 3103.52]  Amen.
[3103.52 --> 3103.64]  Amen.
[3125.22 --> 3133.38]  We are going to continue our worship with a chance to hear and reflect upon God's word together.
[3133.38 --> 3138.58]  And we're going to do that from what is for many a very familiar psalm.
[3139.30 --> 3149.76]  And as we are celebrating births and God's goodness in that, a very appropriate psalm for our reflection and worship this morning.
[3149.90 --> 3152.96]  We're going to read from Psalm 139.
[3152.96 --> 3158.50]  And so if you have a Bible either in your hands or from the back or on your device,
[3159.30 --> 3160.88]  I encourage you to open that up, turn that on.
[3160.88 --> 3169.54]  The first time through, it will be on the screen, but it will help you as we go through if you are able to keep that with you or in front of you.
[3170.94 --> 3176.76]  I'm going to read through the psalm once together, and then you can have it there.
[3176.96 --> 3177.98]  Let's read.
[3181.48 --> 3182.88]  Psalm 139.
[3182.96 --> 3187.10]  You have searched me, Lord, and you know me.
[3187.92 --> 3190.20]  You know when I sit and when I rise.
[3190.34 --> 3192.54]  You perceive my thoughts from afar.
[3193.52 --> 3196.56]  You discern my going out and my lying down.
[3196.96 --> 3199.60]  You are familiar with all my ways.
[3200.10 --> 3203.78]  Before a word is on my tongue, you know, Lord, it completely.
[3204.74 --> 3209.12]  You hem me in behind and before, and you lay your hand upon me.
[3209.12 --> 3214.52]  Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to attain.
[3214.52 --> 3218.58]  Where can I go from your spirit?
[3218.58 --> 3220.68]  Where can I flee from your presence?
[3220.68 --> 3222.98]  If I go up to the heavens, you are there.
[3222.98 --> 3226.02]  If I make my bed in the depths, you are there.
[3226.02 --> 3233.14]  If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle on the far side of the sea, even there your hand will guide me.
[3233.14 --> 3235.74]  Your right hand will hold me fast.
[3235.74 --> 3241.84]  If I say surely the darkness will hide me and the light will become night around me.
[3241.84 --> 3245.60]  Even the darkness will not be dark to you.
[3246.24 --> 3250.50]  The light will shine like the day, for darkness is as light to you.
[3251.66 --> 3255.00]  For you created my inmost being.
[3255.46 --> 3257.40]  You knit me together in my mother's womb.
[3257.54 --> 3261.02]  I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[3261.42 --> 3262.84]  Your works are wonderful.
[3263.68 --> 3265.54]  I know that full well.
[3265.54 --> 3273.48]  My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place, when I was woven together in the depths of the earth.
[3274.24 --> 3277.24]  Your eyes saw my unformed body.
[3277.40 --> 3282.44]  All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.
[3283.52 --> 3286.44]  How precious to me are your thoughts, God!
[3286.62 --> 3288.44]  How vast the sum of them!
[3289.36 --> 3292.34]  Were I to count them, they would outnumber the grains of the sand.
[3292.34 --> 3294.92]  When I awake, I am still with you.
[3295.54 --> 3300.36]  If only you, God, would slay the wicked.
[3300.74 --> 3303.14]  Away from me, you who are bloodthirsty.
[3303.98 --> 3305.88]  They speak of you with evil intent.
[3306.24 --> 3308.40]  Your adversaries misuse your name.
[3309.44 --> 3314.28]  Do I not hate those who hate you, Lord, and abhor those who are in rebellion against you?
[3314.86 --> 3317.18]  I have nothing but hatred for them.
[3317.28 --> 3318.56]  I count them my enemies.
[3319.76 --> 3323.42]  Search me, God, and know my heart.
[3323.42 --> 3331.60]  Test me, and know my anxious thoughts, and see if there is any offensive way in me,
[3331.90 --> 3335.04]  and lead me in the way everlasting.
[3335.70 --> 3336.86]  This is the word of the Lord.
[3336.86 --> 3338.40]  Thanks be to God.
[3338.40 --> 3353.18]  A little while ago, my sister-in-law, who lives in Ontario, was telling us a story about my niece.
[3353.96 --> 3358.92]  My niece is three years old, and she is rambunctious and full of life.
[3359.08 --> 3360.10]  That's one way to put it.
[3360.10 --> 3364.24]  She was playing hide-and-seek with her older sister,
[3364.90 --> 3371.74]  and she was convinced that she had found the best hiding spot in their house.
[3372.80 --> 3376.56]  You see, what she had done is she had taken a rubber-made tote
[3376.56 --> 3380.22]  that normally has those ball pit balls in it that they play with,
[3380.26 --> 3383.18]  and they dump into an inflatable pool, but that's where they store them.
[3383.18 --> 3386.46]  She had taken that rubber-made tote, dumped all the balls out,
[3386.84 --> 3389.84]  flipped it over, and then hid underneath.
[3391.92 --> 3396.08]  And my sister-in-law says you could hear her giggling
[3396.08 --> 3401.06]  as she thought she had found the perfect spot.
[3402.24 --> 3403.86]  I have a picture I want you to see.
[3403.86 --> 3411.94]  The perfect spot she found, if you can't see it,
[3412.46 --> 3414.76]  was under a clear plastic rubber-made tote,
[3415.08 --> 3418.32]  and she was covering her eyes and laughing away.
[3423.08 --> 3426.68]  I think, not only is this adorable, and isn't she amazing,
[3426.68 --> 3431.88]  but I think this is an awesome illustration
[3431.88 --> 3440.06]  of how we look to God when we try to hide ourselves,
[3440.92 --> 3444.62]  when we try to keep our hearts secret from who God is.
[3445.38 --> 3447.64]  We think we're being really good at it,
[3448.64 --> 3453.28]  and God sees right through the box that we hide.
[3454.24 --> 3455.88]  Try to cover it up, try to hide it,
[3455.88 --> 3458.04]  try to shut our eyes to it,
[3458.28 --> 3460.52]  no matter how deep we bury it down,
[3460.60 --> 3463.56]  or stuff it into the deepest corners of our subconscious.
[3464.04 --> 3465.82]  Try, as we might, to ignore it,
[3465.88 --> 3468.78]  or to distract others from the truth of it.
[3469.86 --> 3474.86]  All of who we are is clear to God.
[3476.82 --> 3479.94]  And this morning, as we reflect on Psalm 139,
[3479.94 --> 3481.70]  you have a choice to make.
[3481.70 --> 3489.08]  Because this truth can either be terrifying or anxiety-inducing,
[3489.30 --> 3495.96]  or, like I believe, it can be the single greatest source of peace
[3495.96 --> 3500.18]  and comfort, of hope in your life for every day,
[3500.34 --> 3503.26]  for every moment, and everything you face.
[3503.26 --> 3507.34]  And whether it's the first or the latter,
[3507.48 --> 3508.48]  that's up to you.
[3508.70 --> 3510.86]  That's your choice this morning.
[3512.06 --> 3516.58]  This is the truth, I think, of Psalm 139.
[3517.30 --> 3519.02]  That God knows everything,
[3519.42 --> 3520.84]  that God is everywhere,
[3521.10 --> 3523.32]  and that God will deal with everyone.
[3524.38 --> 3526.46]  The truth of Psalm 139,
[3526.46 --> 3529.74]  this is the truth of Psalm 139,
[3529.82 --> 3531.50]  and because it is true,
[3532.02 --> 3535.60]  that becomes for us comfort, peace, and hope.
[3535.98 --> 3538.78]  That's our big idea this morning,
[3538.86 --> 3541.88]  and the structure of this passage and this message.
[3542.42 --> 3544.04]  One, that God knows everything.
[3544.60 --> 3545.94]  Two, God is everywhere.
[3546.24 --> 3548.84]  And three, God will deal with everyone.
[3548.84 --> 3552.32]  And so, we can have comfort and peace
[3552.32 --> 3554.76]  in life and in death.
[3556.04 --> 3557.44]  Now, if your Bibles are open,
[3557.54 --> 3558.78]  and this is one of the reasons why I asked you
[3558.78 --> 3560.04]  to have that in front of you,
[3560.80 --> 3565.80]  you can see the way the editors have structured it
[3565.80 --> 3567.40]  in whatever translation you're reading.
[3567.48 --> 3568.56]  It's probably very similar.
[3569.24 --> 3571.92]  And it's based on the Hebrew poetry
[3571.92 --> 3574.12]  and the way this is organized there,
[3574.12 --> 3576.90]  but it's structured into four sections,
[3577.38 --> 3579.10]  each of six verses.
[3579.10 --> 3582.16]  Now, the first section there,
[3582.40 --> 3583.88]  verses one through six,
[3584.26 --> 3585.98]  is our number one.
[3586.12 --> 3588.02]  It's our first point, right?
[3588.12 --> 3589.90]  God knows everything.
[3590.66 --> 3591.44]  And specifically,
[3591.96 --> 3595.00]  God knows everything about me.
[3597.76 --> 3601.30]  This is about God's intimate
[3601.30 --> 3603.58]  and perfect knowledge
[3603.58 --> 3606.32]  of my whole person.
[3606.32 --> 3609.44]  about how there's nothing hidden
[3609.44 --> 3610.70]  from his sight.
[3611.70 --> 3613.68]  You have searched me, Lord,
[3613.76 --> 3614.80]  and you know me.
[3616.06 --> 3616.20]  Right?
[3616.24 --> 3617.16]  God has examined.
[3617.70 --> 3618.96]  He has looked deeply
[3618.96 --> 3620.86]  and he has seen it all.
[3621.38 --> 3622.46]  He knows you.
[3623.26 --> 3625.02]  And it's important to realize
[3625.02 --> 3627.96]  that he has always known you.
[3628.76 --> 3628.90]  Right?
[3628.90 --> 3630.84]  God is outside of time.
[3631.00 --> 3631.90]  He is transcendent,
[3632.68 --> 3634.00]  is sometimes the word we use.
[3634.00 --> 3636.38]  It means he is over and above things.
[3636.46 --> 3638.84]  He is outside of space and time.
[3638.94 --> 3640.90]  That's what transcendent means for God.
[3640.98 --> 3643.84]  And he sees from that vantage point.
[3644.68 --> 3644.86]  Right?
[3644.90 --> 3645.56]  What did we read?
[3646.66 --> 3648.54]  You know when I sit and when I rise,
[3648.64 --> 3651.86]  you perceive my thoughts from afar.
[3653.30 --> 3653.60]  Right?
[3653.66 --> 3656.46]  From God's transcendent vantage point,
[3656.60 --> 3659.34]  he sees and he knows everything.
[3659.70 --> 3662.00]  He sees your heart and your desires.
[3662.00 --> 3665.30]  He sees your mind and your will.
[3665.62 --> 3667.28]  He knows your actions.
[3669.40 --> 3672.00]  You know when I sit and when I rise.
[3673.16 --> 3676.24]  You discern my going out and my lying down.
[3676.74 --> 3680.08]  You are familiar with all my ways.
[3681.88 --> 3682.08]  Right?
[3682.10 --> 3683.10]  He knows your words.
[3683.64 --> 3684.90]  In fact, he knows the words
[3684.90 --> 3686.22]  before it's on your tongue,
[3686.30 --> 3687.52]  before a word is on my tongue.
[3687.60 --> 3689.02]  You know it, Lord, completely.
[3689.02 --> 3691.40]  And he knows your life.
[3692.22 --> 3693.94]  Past, present, and future
[3693.94 --> 3697.38]  are all concurrent, present to God.
[3698.42 --> 3698.76]  He says,
[3698.86 --> 3701.24]  You hem me in behind and before.
[3701.58 --> 3704.18]  You lay your hand upon me.
[3705.36 --> 3706.82]  I hope you can see it.
[3707.14 --> 3708.82]  God knows everything.
[3709.32 --> 3711.72]  And this isn't some general knowledge
[3711.72 --> 3714.56]  about things generally happening in the world.
[3714.56 --> 3717.50]  This is a specific and particular knowledge
[3717.50 --> 3718.36]  about you.
[3719.58 --> 3720.96]  About who you are.
[3722.90 --> 3725.90]  There's a quote from a theologian
[3725.90 --> 3727.62]  named A.W. Tozer.
[3727.78 --> 3729.46]  He wrote in the 1960s.
[3730.30 --> 3731.58]  It's a bit of a longer quote,
[3731.72 --> 3733.08]  but it's written in a way
[3733.08 --> 3734.48]  that people just don't talk anymore.
[3734.72 --> 3736.80]  And so there's something beautiful to it.
[3737.18 --> 3738.12]  And so I want to share it with you.
[3738.86 --> 3740.10]  This is from his book called
[3740.10 --> 3741.34]  The Knowledge of the Holy.
[3741.34 --> 3747.68]  God knows instantly and effortlessly
[3747.68 --> 3749.88]  all matter and all matters,
[3750.68 --> 3753.04]  all mind and every mind,
[3753.40 --> 3755.08]  all spirit and all spirits,
[3755.20 --> 3757.52]  all being and every being,
[3757.68 --> 3760.00]  all creaturehood and all creatures,
[3760.16 --> 3762.98]  every plurality and all pluralities,
[3763.12 --> 3764.82]  all law and every law,
[3765.08 --> 3766.66]  all relations, all causes,
[3766.78 --> 3767.36]  all thoughts,
[3767.36 --> 3769.00]  all mysteries,
[3769.52 --> 3770.16]  all enigmas,
[3770.32 --> 3770.86]  all feeling,
[3771.04 --> 3771.74]  all desires,
[3772.24 --> 3773.66]  every unuttered secret,
[3773.84 --> 3775.14]  all thrones and dominions,
[3775.26 --> 3776.02]  all personalities,
[3776.32 --> 3777.84]  all things visible and invisible
[3777.84 --> 3778.98]  in heaven and on earth,
[3779.14 --> 3781.12]  motion, space, time, life, death,
[3781.50 --> 3783.42]  good, evil, heaven and hell.
[3784.26 --> 3787.86]  And he is never surprised.
[3790.52 --> 3792.72]  Think about that for a moment
[3792.72 --> 3794.72]  by way of comparison.
[3794.72 --> 3799.22]  Listen, generally speaking,
[3799.72 --> 3805.46]  what is your greatest source of anxiety
[3805.46 --> 3808.72]  or worry or fear in this life?
[3810.72 --> 3812.46]  In some way, generally,
[3812.96 --> 3814.18]  all of our anxieties,
[3814.34 --> 3815.12]  all of our fears,
[3815.28 --> 3816.16]  all of our worries
[3816.16 --> 3819.42]  are related to what we don't know
[3819.42 --> 3822.10]  or what we can't know
[3822.10 --> 3823.46]  or what we can't see,
[3824.00 --> 3824.12]  right,
[3824.12 --> 3825.30]  what we don't understand.
[3825.94 --> 3827.86]  Most often in life,
[3827.96 --> 3829.88]  it's some form of the unknown
[3829.88 --> 3833.50]  that increases or causes our anxiety
[3833.50 --> 3835.42]  or our fear and our worry.
[3836.76 --> 3839.74]  And because God knows everything,
[3840.00 --> 3842.20]  because he is never surprised,
[3842.26 --> 3843.24]  like Tozer says,
[3843.54 --> 3845.10]  that's why there's no fear
[3845.10 --> 3847.28]  or anxiety or worry in him,
[3847.28 --> 3849.42]  because nothing catches him off guard,
[3850.20 --> 3850.32]  right?
[3850.36 --> 3851.58]  Not even your deepest,
[3852.06 --> 3854.16]  darkest, dirtiest secrets.
[3855.50 --> 3857.22]  Nothing catches him unaware.
[3858.28 --> 3860.18]  Not even the most horrific thing
[3860.18 --> 3861.80]  you've ever thought or done.
[3863.46 --> 3865.54]  In his presence,
[3865.78 --> 3867.52]  to his gaze,
[3867.82 --> 3870.28]  you are laid bare.
[3870.28 --> 3874.56]  And let me be clear,
[3874.68 --> 3876.86]  if that's terrifying to you,
[3878.16 --> 3879.72]  it could be because
[3879.72 --> 3881.08]  you're coming at this
[3881.08 --> 3882.44]  from a human perspective.
[3882.64 --> 3882.88]  That is,
[3883.10 --> 3883.96]  you're coming at this
[3883.96 --> 3885.30]  full of the same assumptions
[3885.30 --> 3886.52]  you would have
[3886.52 --> 3888.12]  if you saw the depths
[3888.12 --> 3889.80]  of that person's heart
[3889.80 --> 3891.04]  or that you would have
[3891.04 --> 3892.24]  or that you would assume
[3892.24 --> 3893.22]  if you knew
[3893.22 --> 3894.06]  the deepest
[3894.06 --> 3895.38]  and darkest corners
[3895.38 --> 3896.44]  of their mind.
[3896.52 --> 3897.26]  You're coming at this
[3897.26 --> 3898.08]  from the assumption
[3898.08 --> 3899.32]  of what you think
[3899.32 --> 3900.78]  other people might say
[3900.78 --> 3901.78]  if they saw the depths
[3901.78 --> 3902.62]  of your being.
[3904.00 --> 3905.58]  But God is not like you
[3905.58 --> 3906.92]  and me in that regard.
[3907.18 --> 3907.96]  More accurately,
[3908.34 --> 3908.80]  you and I
[3908.80 --> 3909.76]  are not like God
[3909.76 --> 3910.70]  in that regard.
[3913.02 --> 3913.90]  The truth is,
[3914.02 --> 3914.56]  and the psalmist
[3914.56 --> 3915.28]  makes it really clear,
[3915.38 --> 3916.42]  that kind of awareness,
[3916.66 --> 3918.40]  that kind of self-knowledge
[3918.40 --> 3919.42]  would, in fact,
[3919.50 --> 3921.26]  be too much for us.
[3922.16 --> 3923.06]  That's David's point
[3923.06 --> 3923.98]  in verse 6.
[3924.88 --> 3925.16]  He says,
[3925.58 --> 3926.52]  such knowledge
[3926.52 --> 3927.76]  is too wonderful
[3927.76 --> 3928.36]  for me,
[3928.48 --> 3929.40]  too lofty
[3929.40 --> 3930.58]  for me to attain.
[3931.56 --> 3932.46]  That word,
[3932.58 --> 3933.50]  too wonderful,
[3933.76 --> 3934.34]  in Hebrew,
[3934.70 --> 3936.32]  means incomprehensible.
[3937.84 --> 3938.96]  It's too much.
[3940.68 --> 3941.16]  Now, I want you
[3941.16 --> 3941.66]  to see this
[3941.66 --> 3943.72]  carefully.
[3944.78 --> 3945.88]  If you have your Bibles open,
[3946.06 --> 3946.50]  this will help
[3946.50 --> 3947.42]  if you look at the text.
[3949.46 --> 3950.58]  Such knowledge
[3950.58 --> 3951.76]  is too wonderful.
[3951.76 --> 3953.80]  It is incomprehensible.
[3953.80 --> 3955.88]  And then,
[3955.98 --> 3956.96]  it describes,
[3957.20 --> 3958.10]  through what's called
[3958.10 --> 3958.98]  parallelism,
[3959.48 --> 3960.22]  saying it is
[3960.22 --> 3961.50]  too lofty
[3961.50 --> 3962.76]  for me to attain.
[3963.30 --> 3964.26]  Too lofty
[3964.26 --> 3965.22]  means that it is
[3965.22 --> 3965.78]  high above.
[3965.92 --> 3967.06]  It's far away.
[3967.60 --> 3968.84]  It's like what David said
[3968.84 --> 3969.68]  back in verse 2
[3969.68 --> 3970.18]  when he says,
[3970.30 --> 3971.20]  you know when I sit
[3971.20 --> 3971.78]  and when I rise,
[3971.86 --> 3972.92]  you perceive my thoughts
[3972.92 --> 3973.76]  from where?
[3975.34 --> 3976.18]  From afar.
[3977.84 --> 3979.30]  Here's what I want you
[3979.30 --> 3979.66]  to hear.
[3980.56 --> 3981.58]  God's knowledge
[3981.58 --> 3982.46]  of all
[3982.46 --> 3983.78]  is related
[3983.78 --> 3985.48]  to his transcendence
[3985.48 --> 3986.18]  overall.
[3988.10 --> 3989.14]  Did you catch that?
[3990.12 --> 3991.08]  God's knowledge
[3991.08 --> 3991.90]  of all
[3991.90 --> 3992.72]  is related
[3992.72 --> 3994.24]  to his transcendence
[3994.24 --> 3995.02]  overall.
[3995.30 --> 3996.02]  And what I mean
[3996.02 --> 3996.56]  by that
[3996.56 --> 3997.24]  is that because
[3997.24 --> 3998.68]  God is above all,
[3998.82 --> 4000.20]  because he is
[4000.20 --> 4001.94]  out of this
[4001.94 --> 4003.24]  world and system,
[4003.34 --> 4004.16]  because he is
[4004.16 --> 4005.48]  totally holy,
[4005.78 --> 4007.10]  that is set apart,
[4007.52 --> 4007.66]  right,
[4007.72 --> 4009.34]  he is wholly other,
[4009.66 --> 4010.60]  he is able
[4010.60 --> 4011.28]  to see
[4011.28 --> 4012.02]  everything
[4012.02 --> 4012.98]  that is.
[4014.00 --> 4014.86]  Let's say that again.
[4015.46 --> 4016.98]  God's transcendence,
[4017.02 --> 4017.84]  there's that word again,
[4018.14 --> 4018.98]  isn't about
[4018.98 --> 4020.14]  his physical
[4020.14 --> 4021.12]  or material
[4021.12 --> 4022.00]  location
[4022.00 --> 4023.16]  in this world.
[4024.00 --> 4024.70]  We're not saying
[4024.70 --> 4025.46]  that God is somewhere
[4025.46 --> 4026.54]  up in the sky
[4026.54 --> 4027.54]  when we are saying
[4027.54 --> 4028.60]  that he is transcendent.
[4028.90 --> 4029.28]  Instead,
[4029.66 --> 4030.30]  what we mean
[4030.30 --> 4031.50]  when we say
[4031.50 --> 4033.02]  that God is transcendent
[4033.02 --> 4033.74]  is that he is
[4033.74 --> 4035.06]  wholly other,
[4035.24 --> 4036.20]  he is a wholly
[4036.20 --> 4037.60]  other being,
[4037.94 --> 4039.56]  he is true being,
[4039.66 --> 4040.78]  in a capital B
[4040.78 --> 4041.72]  sense of the word.
[4042.30 --> 4042.42]  Right?
[4042.50 --> 4044.08]  All of our being
[4044.08 --> 4044.88]  and our existing
[4044.88 --> 4046.56]  is dependent upon
[4046.56 --> 4047.78]  his being
[4047.78 --> 4049.38]  and his existing.
[4049.50 --> 4050.82]  That's transcendence.
[4052.42 --> 4054.08]  And it's this truth
[4054.08 --> 4056.40]  about who God is,
[4056.66 --> 4058.84]  this transcendent God,
[4058.96 --> 4060.86]  that makes the second part
[4060.86 --> 4062.74]  of Psalm 139
[4062.74 --> 4063.88]  so beautiful
[4063.88 --> 4064.94]  and so compelling.
[4064.94 --> 4066.76]  because not only
[4066.76 --> 4068.58]  does this transcendent God
[4068.58 --> 4069.96]  know everything
[4069.96 --> 4071.56]  about you,
[4072.78 --> 4075.98]  but this God
[4075.98 --> 4077.70]  is everywhere.
[4078.00 --> 4078.60]  Specifically,
[4079.14 --> 4080.40]  he is everywhere
[4080.40 --> 4082.36]  with you.
[4083.58 --> 4084.40]  In verse 7,
[4084.78 --> 4085.46]  David asks,
[4085.66 --> 4086.32]  where can I go
[4086.32 --> 4087.20]  from your spirit?
[4087.32 --> 4088.26]  Where can I flee
[4088.26 --> 4089.40]  from your presence?
[4090.26 --> 4091.06]  And then the answer
[4091.06 --> 4091.78]  that he gives
[4091.78 --> 4092.46]  in this section
[4092.46 --> 4093.08]  is nowhere.
[4093.98 --> 4094.16]  Right?
[4094.18 --> 4095.18]  If I go up to the sky,
[4095.32 --> 4095.70]  you're there.
[4095.86 --> 4096.76]  If I make my bed
[4096.76 --> 4097.26]  in the depths,
[4097.40 --> 4097.78]  you're there.
[4097.88 --> 4098.64]  If I go to heaven,
[4098.78 --> 4099.24]  you are there.
[4099.34 --> 4100.46]  If I go to the grave,
[4100.80 --> 4101.40]  you are there.
[4101.58 --> 4102.76]  At the beginning of the day,
[4102.84 --> 4103.50]  you are there.
[4103.64 --> 4104.66]  Even if I flee
[4104.66 --> 4105.96]  to the furthest side
[4105.96 --> 4106.60]  of the sea,
[4107.78 --> 4108.40]  you are there.
[4110.94 --> 4112.22]  The amazing thing
[4112.22 --> 4113.90]  about God's transcendence
[4113.90 --> 4116.36]  is that it is matched
[4116.36 --> 4118.50]  by his imminence.
[4120.24 --> 4120.76]  Right?
[4120.82 --> 4121.54]  The amazing thing
[4121.54 --> 4122.06]  about God
[4122.06 --> 4124.02]  being so wholly other
[4124.02 --> 4125.40]  is that it is matched
[4125.40 --> 4126.60]  by his being
[4126.60 --> 4128.04]  with us.
[4128.84 --> 4128.98]  Right?
[4129.08 --> 4129.90]  God's imminence
[4129.90 --> 4130.90]  by his spirit
[4130.90 --> 4131.78]  means that he is
[4131.78 --> 4133.20]  with us everywhere.
[4133.34 --> 4134.00]  The same God
[4134.00 --> 4134.96]  who is transcendent
[4134.96 --> 4136.30]  over all the universe
[4136.30 --> 4137.12]  is present
[4137.12 --> 4138.62]  in the universe
[4138.62 --> 4139.32]  that he created
[4139.32 --> 4140.34]  by his spirit.
[4141.18 --> 4141.58]  And again,
[4142.26 --> 4142.94]  hear carefully
[4142.94 --> 4144.06]  verse 12.
[4146.44 --> 4147.50]  Even darkness
[4147.50 --> 4149.70]  is not dark to you.
[4150.52 --> 4151.12]  The darkness
[4151.12 --> 4153.24]  is as light to you.
[4154.08 --> 4154.74]  That means
[4154.74 --> 4156.54]  even when it seems like,
[4156.86 --> 4158.50]  even when it feels like
[4158.50 --> 4159.66]  God is not around,
[4160.06 --> 4161.30]  even when it seems like
[4161.30 --> 4161.98]  or feels like
[4161.98 --> 4162.90]  he is not near,
[4163.32 --> 4164.40]  even when you look out
[4164.40 --> 4165.02]  at your life
[4165.02 --> 4167.00]  and you cannot see him,
[4167.04 --> 4167.72]  you are blind
[4167.72 --> 4169.36]  to his presence,
[4169.62 --> 4170.80]  no matter what life
[4170.80 --> 4171.62]  throws at you
[4171.62 --> 4172.70]  that seems to have
[4172.70 --> 4173.70]  pushed him away
[4173.70 --> 4174.40]  or caused you
[4174.40 --> 4175.32]  to push him away,
[4175.72 --> 4177.62]  the true reality
[4177.62 --> 4178.94]  of the matter is,
[4179.06 --> 4180.54]  the spiritual reality
[4180.54 --> 4182.26]  is that God
[4182.26 --> 4183.84]  is here.
[4185.22 --> 4186.38]  That he is close to you,
[4186.44 --> 4187.54]  that he is near you,
[4187.62 --> 4188.80]  that he has never left you
[4188.80 --> 4189.94]  nor forsaken you.
[4190.44 --> 4191.34]  And he never will.
[4192.30 --> 4193.98]  Darkness is as light
[4193.98 --> 4194.48]  to you
[4194.48 --> 4196.14]  in the pitchest black
[4196.14 --> 4197.32]  when you can't see
[4197.32 --> 4197.88]  a thing,
[4198.26 --> 4199.08]  God sees
[4199.08 --> 4200.02]  as if it were
[4200.02 --> 4200.98]  the noonday sun
[4200.98 --> 4202.10]  shining bright overhead.
[4204.64 --> 4205.56]  And then,
[4205.82 --> 4207.18]  God's transcendence
[4207.18 --> 4209.18]  and his imminence
[4209.18 --> 4210.48]  come together
[4210.48 --> 4212.54]  to bring comfort
[4212.54 --> 4214.34]  and peace.
[4215.80 --> 4217.24]  God's seeing all
[4217.24 --> 4218.46]  and being everywhere
[4218.46 --> 4219.58]  comes together
[4219.58 --> 4220.20]  for you
[4220.20 --> 4221.28]  and for me.
[4221.58 --> 4222.56]  For the one
[4222.56 --> 4222.96]  who,
[4223.18 --> 4223.80]  by grace
[4223.80 --> 4224.48]  through faith,
[4224.62 --> 4225.76]  believes that this is true,
[4226.06 --> 4226.70]  for the one
[4226.70 --> 4227.94]  who is chosen
[4227.94 --> 4228.60]  by God.
[4228.68 --> 4229.84]  This comes together
[4229.84 --> 4230.22]  then
[4230.22 --> 4232.92]  in this third section
[4232.92 --> 4234.10]  in the truth
[4234.10 --> 4235.24]  of verses 13
[4235.24 --> 4236.26]  through 18.
[4237.62 --> 4239.04]  For you created
[4239.04 --> 4240.74]  my inmost being.
[4242.08 --> 4243.10]  You knit me together
[4243.10 --> 4244.58]  in my mother's womb.
[4246.22 --> 4247.42]  God's knowledge
[4247.42 --> 4248.44]  of you
[4248.44 --> 4251.50]  is from before
[4251.50 --> 4252.96]  there is even
[4252.96 --> 4253.58]  a you
[4253.58 --> 4254.90]  to be known.
[4256.70 --> 4257.54]  Did you get that?
[4259.16 --> 4260.08]  Verse 16,
[4260.32 --> 4260.88]  Your eyes
[4260.88 --> 4262.20]  saw my unformed
[4262.20 --> 4262.84]  body.
[4262.98 --> 4263.76]  All the days
[4263.76 --> 4264.54]  ordained for me
[4264.54 --> 4265.02]  were written
[4265.02 --> 4265.90]  in your book
[4265.90 --> 4267.20]  before one of them
[4267.20 --> 4267.98]  came to be.
[4269.40 --> 4270.34]  From eternity
[4270.34 --> 4270.90]  past
[4270.90 --> 4272.22]  in the mind
[4272.22 --> 4272.84]  of God
[4272.84 --> 4274.72]  to being created
[4274.72 --> 4275.20]  body
[4275.20 --> 4276.24]  and soul,
[4276.56 --> 4277.40]  all of you
[4277.40 --> 4278.70]  and all of your life
[4278.70 --> 4279.70]  is known
[4279.70 --> 4280.62]  to God
[4280.62 --> 4281.80]  and he is present
[4281.80 --> 4282.66]  in it.
[4283.88 --> 4284.66]  And so think about that,
[4284.74 --> 4284.80]  right?
[4285.00 --> 4286.24]  Think about what that means
[4286.24 --> 4287.18]  for that everything
[4287.18 --> 4288.34]  that you are facing,
[4289.20 --> 4290.32]  whatever it is,
[4291.14 --> 4292.60]  God knows about it.
[4293.76 --> 4295.28]  He has a plan for it.
[4295.92 --> 4297.08]  He has a purpose
[4297.08 --> 4297.92]  in it.
[4298.70 --> 4300.14]  And he is with you
[4300.14 --> 4301.40]  through it.
[4303.48 --> 4305.00]  Because of who God is,
[4305.48 --> 4307.12]  because of what God sees,
[4307.42 --> 4308.56]  because his presence
[4308.56 --> 4309.90]  is always
[4309.90 --> 4311.12]  and forever
[4311.12 --> 4312.00]  with you,
[4312.08 --> 4313.24]  because his spirit
[4313.24 --> 4314.82]  is granting faith
[4314.82 --> 4315.64]  by grace
[4315.64 --> 4316.42]  if you believe,
[4316.66 --> 4316.80]  right?
[4316.84 --> 4318.24]  We are given
[4318.24 --> 4319.74]  eyes to see
[4319.74 --> 4320.82]  God at work
[4320.82 --> 4321.88]  in this way.
[4323.00 --> 4323.90]  And not only
[4323.90 --> 4324.86]  do we get to see
[4324.86 --> 4325.76]  God at work
[4325.76 --> 4326.40]  more clearly,
[4326.62 --> 4327.72]  but in seeing
[4327.72 --> 4329.04]  God more clearly,
[4329.20 --> 4330.54]  it's like holding up
[4330.54 --> 4330.98]  a mirror,
[4331.14 --> 4331.82]  we begin to see
[4331.82 --> 4332.64]  ourselves
[4332.64 --> 4333.96]  more truly
[4333.96 --> 4334.58]  as well.
[4335.98 --> 4336.46]  And I believe
[4336.46 --> 4336.92]  that there is
[4336.92 --> 4337.88]  a clarity
[4337.88 --> 4338.78]  of mind
[4338.78 --> 4339.66]  and purpose
[4339.66 --> 4341.16]  that comes,
[4341.28 --> 4341.78]  a clarity
[4341.78 --> 4342.96]  of identity
[4342.96 --> 4344.46]  for who you are
[4344.46 --> 4344.96]  in the world,
[4345.04 --> 4345.86]  who I am,
[4346.20 --> 4346.82]  that comes
[4346.82 --> 4347.76]  when we see
[4347.76 --> 4349.98]  God most clearly
[4349.98 --> 4351.06]  as he is revealed
[4351.06 --> 4352.26]  to us in the Bible,
[4352.36 --> 4353.20]  as he gives himself
[4353.20 --> 4354.22]  to us by grace
[4354.22 --> 4355.00]  through faith,
[4355.12 --> 4356.18]  as he makes union
[4356.18 --> 4357.24]  with us possible
[4357.24 --> 4358.36]  through Christ Jesus.
[4358.60 --> 4359.62]  All of a sudden,
[4360.20 --> 4361.30]  we get a better
[4361.30 --> 4362.44]  and a more clear
[4362.44 --> 4363.42]  picture of what it
[4363.42 --> 4364.72]  means to be human,
[4365.16 --> 4366.02]  fully alive
[4366.02 --> 4366.70]  to the glory
[4366.70 --> 4367.62]  of God.
[4368.64 --> 4369.44]  That's why it's
[4369.44 --> 4370.00]  the believer
[4370.00 --> 4371.10]  who knows
[4371.10 --> 4371.70]  that God has
[4371.70 --> 4372.50]  knit us together
[4372.50 --> 4373.64]  in our mother's wombs.
[4373.86 --> 4374.54]  That's why it's
[4374.54 --> 4375.08]  the believer
[4375.08 --> 4376.32]  who can praise God
[4376.32 --> 4377.02]  because she is
[4377.02 --> 4377.48]  fearfully
[4377.48 --> 4378.86]  and wonderfully made.
[4379.12 --> 4379.68]  That's why it's
[4379.68 --> 4380.22]  the believer
[4380.22 --> 4380.74]  who knows
[4380.74 --> 4381.56]  that personhood
[4381.56 --> 4382.48]  or that humanity,
[4382.98 --> 4383.82]  that story
[4383.82 --> 4384.62]  and life
[4384.62 --> 4385.26]  are rooted
[4385.26 --> 4386.38]  not in
[4386.38 --> 4388.68]  my physical expression,
[4388.86 --> 4389.42]  but actually
[4389.42 --> 4390.90]  in the being
[4390.90 --> 4391.46]  of God.
[4392.84 --> 4393.48]  That's why
[4393.48 --> 4394.24]  believers are
[4394.24 --> 4394.96]  for life
[4394.96 --> 4396.08]  from conception
[4396.08 --> 4397.04]  to death
[4397.04 --> 4398.08]  and it has
[4398.08 --> 4398.86]  nothing to do
[4398.86 --> 4399.48]  with your body
[4399.48 --> 4400.14]  or my body.
[4400.90 --> 4401.76]  It has everything
[4401.76 --> 4402.32]  to do
[4402.32 --> 4403.62]  with who God is
[4403.62 --> 4405.56]  and what your
[4405.56 --> 4406.62]  identity in him
[4406.62 --> 4408.10]  is rooted in.
[4408.78 --> 4409.42]  That's why
[4409.42 --> 4410.18]  it's the believer
[4410.18 --> 4411.56]  who can say,
[4412.12 --> 4412.64]  how precious
[4412.64 --> 4413.34]  to me
[4413.34 --> 4414.40]  are your thoughts,
[4415.04 --> 4415.56]  O God.
[4416.92 --> 4417.80]  Now that one line
[4417.80 --> 4418.72]  is worth drilling down
[4418.72 --> 4419.50]  for just a second.
[4419.62 --> 4420.42]  That's verse 17.
[4422.42 --> 4423.04]  How precious
[4423.04 --> 4423.62]  to me
[4423.62 --> 4424.42]  are your thoughts,
[4424.56 --> 4424.98]  O God.
[4424.98 --> 4426.20]  how vast
[4426.20 --> 4427.50]  the sum of them.
[4429.52 --> 4430.42]  Now in this psalm,
[4431.56 --> 4432.18]  David has written
[4432.18 --> 4432.70]  for us,
[4434.04 --> 4435.64]  what have been
[4435.64 --> 4436.34]  the thoughts
[4436.34 --> 4436.96]  of God
[4436.96 --> 4437.50]  about?
[4438.04 --> 4438.98]  Or more precisely,
[4439.50 --> 4440.84]  who have been
[4440.84 --> 4441.36]  the thoughts
[4441.36 --> 4442.02]  of God about?
[4443.02 --> 4443.88]  In this psalm,
[4443.98 --> 4445.30]  who is in the mind
[4445.30 --> 4445.80]  of God?
[4446.66 --> 4447.90]  It's the psalmist.
[4448.14 --> 4448.86]  It's David.
[4450.64 --> 4451.82]  It's the believer
[4451.82 --> 4453.00]  who praises God.
[4453.38 --> 4454.66]  David is cherishing
[4454.66 --> 4455.26]  the thoughts
[4455.26 --> 4455.92]  of God
[4455.92 --> 4456.54]  because
[4456.54 --> 4458.20]  in this moment,
[4458.46 --> 4459.40]  he is recognizing
[4459.40 --> 4460.42]  that those thoughts
[4460.42 --> 4461.04]  are God
[4461.04 --> 4461.78]  thinking about
[4461.78 --> 4462.48]  how cherished
[4462.48 --> 4463.40]  David is to him.
[4465.36 --> 4466.08]  And when you
[4466.08 --> 4466.86]  are the object
[4466.86 --> 4467.72]  of God's love
[4467.72 --> 4468.28]  and affection,
[4468.54 --> 4469.16]  when you are
[4469.16 --> 4469.74]  the recipient
[4469.74 --> 4470.48]  of his grace
[4470.48 --> 4471.30]  and his mercy,
[4471.30 --> 4472.14]  when you have been
[4472.14 --> 4473.42]  on the mind of God
[4473.42 --> 4473.98]  so that you have
[4473.98 --> 4475.02]  received his gift
[4475.02 --> 4475.70]  of salvation,
[4475.96 --> 4477.34]  there is no more
[4477.34 --> 4478.24]  precious thought
[4478.24 --> 4478.84]  to you
[4478.84 --> 4479.90]  or to me
[4479.90 --> 4481.06]  than the believer
[4481.06 --> 4482.92]  who recognizes
[4482.92 --> 4484.18]  this truth
[4484.18 --> 4485.22]  and that this is
[4485.22 --> 4486.72]  what God
[4486.72 --> 4487.78]  has been
[4487.78 --> 4488.78]  thinking about.
[4489.68 --> 4489.98]  You.
[4491.26 --> 4491.70]  You.
[4494.12 --> 4494.40]  And so,
[4494.58 --> 4496.32]  the praise testimony
[4496.32 --> 4497.96]  of this third section
[4497.96 --> 4498.86]  of verse 13
[4498.86 --> 4499.98]  through 18
[4499.98 --> 4501.16]  will naturally
[4501.16 --> 4502.12]  flow out
[4502.12 --> 4502.68]  if
[4502.68 --> 4503.50]  verses 1
[4503.50 --> 4504.10]  through 12
[4504.10 --> 4504.86]  are true.
[4506.42 --> 4506.66]  Right?
[4506.66 --> 4507.62]  Since God knows
[4507.62 --> 4508.64]  everything about you
[4508.64 --> 4509.28]  and since God
[4509.28 --> 4509.82]  is everywhere
[4509.82 --> 4510.64]  with you
[4510.64 --> 4511.46]  and those realities
[4511.46 --> 4512.20]  come together
[4512.20 --> 4512.88]  in you
[4512.88 --> 4514.12]  and in your story
[4514.12 --> 4515.16]  to bring out
[4515.16 --> 4516.40]  comfort and peace,
[4516.48 --> 4517.36]  to bring praise
[4517.36 --> 4518.68]  out of who you are
[4518.68 --> 4519.78]  even in the darkest
[4519.78 --> 4520.66]  of circumstances.
[4528.14 --> 4529.08]  This is the
[4529.08 --> 4530.34]  gift
[4530.34 --> 4531.82]  of the truth
[4531.82 --> 4533.34]  of God's word
[4533.34 --> 4534.16]  showing us
[4534.16 --> 4534.70]  the truth
[4534.70 --> 4535.94]  of who God is
[4535.94 --> 4536.40]  so that we
[4536.40 --> 4536.66]  can see
[4536.66 --> 4537.22]  the truth
[4537.22 --> 4538.24]  of who we
[4538.24 --> 4538.56]  are
[4538.56 --> 4539.90]  in relationship
[4539.90 --> 4540.30]  to him.
[4541.90 --> 4542.66]  God knows
[4542.66 --> 4543.74]  everything about you
[4543.74 --> 4544.96]  and God is
[4544.96 --> 4545.46]  everywhere
[4545.46 --> 4546.54]  with you
[4546.54 --> 4547.02]  and so
[4547.02 --> 4547.52]  we have
[4547.52 --> 4548.02]  comfort
[4548.02 --> 4548.92]  and peace
[4548.92 --> 4549.34]  and we'll
[4549.34 --> 4549.96]  praise God
[4549.96 --> 4550.78]  for who he is
[4550.78 --> 4552.60]  and so
[4552.60 --> 4553.08]  lastly,
[4553.54 --> 4555.00]  God will
[4555.00 --> 4555.90]  deal with
[4555.90 --> 4557.08]  everyone.
[4558.84 --> 4559.34]  Now,
[4559.38 --> 4559.80]  this is the
[4559.80 --> 4560.14]  part of
[4560.14 --> 4561.40]  Psalm 139
[4561.40 --> 4562.12]  that most people
[4562.12 --> 4562.82]  forget about
[4562.82 --> 4564.36]  or that most
[4564.36 --> 4565.06]  people ignore
[4565.06 --> 4566.08]  or don't read.
[4567.44 --> 4568.26]  In some other
[4568.26 --> 4569.04]  church traditions
[4569.04 --> 4569.62]  and older
[4569.62 --> 4570.56]  Reformed traditions
[4570.56 --> 4571.18]  when we used
[4571.18 --> 4571.54]  to sing
[4571.54 --> 4572.52]  only the Psalms,
[4572.86 --> 4573.70]  this is the
[4573.70 --> 4575.42]  18th
[4575.42 --> 4576.70]  to 20th
[4576.70 --> 4576.98]  verses
[4576.98 --> 4577.62]  that you
[4577.62 --> 4578.24]  wouldn't sing
[4578.24 --> 4579.08]  on Sunday
[4579.08 --> 4579.76]  because it was
[4579.76 --> 4580.30]  too long.
[4580.78 --> 4581.24]  Really,
[4581.38 --> 4581.68]  it's because
[4581.68 --> 4582.00]  it made us
[4582.00 --> 4582.42]  uncomfortable
[4582.42 --> 4583.38]  and we don't
[4583.38 --> 4583.86]  like it.
[4584.70 --> 4585.32]  When people
[4585.32 --> 4586.76]  say Psalm 139
[4586.76 --> 4587.54]  is their favorite,
[4587.76 --> 4588.22]  they usually
[4588.22 --> 4589.18]  mean verse 13
[4589.18 --> 4589.74]  and 14,
[4589.74 --> 4590.62]  for you created
[4590.62 --> 4591.10]  me in my
[4591.10 --> 4591.66]  inmost being,
[4591.76 --> 4592.12]  you knit me
[4592.12 --> 4592.72]  together in my
[4592.72 --> 4593.18]  mother's womb,
[4593.24 --> 4593.86]  I praise you
[4593.86 --> 4594.38]  because I am
[4594.38 --> 4595.00]  fearfully and
[4595.00 --> 4595.72]  wonderfully made,
[4596.10 --> 4596.78]  your works are
[4596.78 --> 4597.14]  wonderful,
[4597.26 --> 4597.76]  I know that
[4597.76 --> 4598.22]  full well.
[4598.56 --> 4599.52]  Sometimes they
[4599.52 --> 4600.26]  mean the first
[4600.26 --> 4601.12]  three sections
[4601.12 --> 4603.70]  but most often
[4603.70 --> 4605.64]  not these
[4605.64 --> 4605.96]  verses.
[4607.36 --> 4608.12]  And maybe
[4608.12 --> 4608.88]  it feels like
[4608.88 --> 4609.48]  there's a shift
[4609.48 --> 4610.68]  in tone here
[4610.68 --> 4611.38]  in this fourth
[4611.38 --> 4612.22]  and final section
[4612.22 --> 4612.84]  but I actually
[4612.84 --> 4613.72]  want to suggest
[4613.72 --> 4614.18]  to you that
[4614.18 --> 4614.74]  the tone
[4614.74 --> 4615.74]  is just
[4615.74 --> 4616.46]  reaching
[4616.46 --> 4617.20]  logical
[4617.20 --> 4618.04]  consequence.
[4619.74 --> 4620.84]  If it is true
[4620.84 --> 4621.74]  or since
[4621.74 --> 4622.54]  it is true
[4622.54 --> 4623.46]  that God
[4623.46 --> 4624.46]  knows everything
[4624.46 --> 4625.24]  about you,
[4625.64 --> 4626.52]  that he sees
[4626.52 --> 4627.06]  the depths
[4627.06 --> 4627.92]  of your heart,
[4628.24 --> 4629.06]  since it is true
[4629.06 --> 4629.74]  that God is
[4629.74 --> 4630.34]  with you
[4630.34 --> 4631.12]  everywhere,
[4631.30 --> 4631.56]  that there's
[4631.56 --> 4632.14]  no place
[4632.14 --> 4632.56]  where you are
[4632.56 --> 4633.16]  able to flee
[4633.16 --> 4634.08]  from his presence,
[4635.70 --> 4636.48]  it must also
[4636.48 --> 4637.02]  be true
[4637.02 --> 4638.10]  that the
[4638.10 --> 4639.14]  injustices
[4639.14 --> 4640.76]  seen,
[4641.34 --> 4641.88]  that the
[4641.88 --> 4642.52]  atrocities
[4642.52 --> 4643.20]  committed,
[4643.34 --> 4643.58]  that the
[4643.58 --> 4644.44]  realities of
[4644.44 --> 4645.00]  sin and
[4645.00 --> 4645.40]  darkness
[4645.40 --> 4646.10]  that are so
[4646.10 --> 4647.06]  clear and
[4647.06 --> 4648.08]  so exposed
[4648.08 --> 4648.72]  to who God
[4648.72 --> 4649.08]  is,
[4649.48 --> 4650.42]  must be
[4650.42 --> 4651.40]  dealt with.
[4652.98 --> 4653.66]  They must
[4653.66 --> 4653.88]  be.
[4655.12 --> 4655.80]  If God
[4655.80 --> 4656.36]  were to see
[4656.36 --> 4657.14]  those things
[4657.14 --> 4657.94]  and not
[4657.94 --> 4658.48]  deal with
[4658.48 --> 4658.70]  them,
[4659.54 --> 4660.62]  that would
[4660.62 --> 4661.02]  mean he's
[4661.02 --> 4661.58]  an unjust
[4661.58 --> 4662.04]  God.
[4662.64 --> 4662.94]  But that's
[4662.94 --> 4663.26]  not the God
[4663.26 --> 4663.70]  I read about
[4663.70 --> 4664.16]  in the Bible.
[4664.86 --> 4665.36]  That would
[4665.36 --> 4665.72]  mean he's
[4665.72 --> 4666.48]  an unrighteous
[4666.48 --> 4666.84]  God.
[4666.92 --> 4667.18]  But again,
[4667.24 --> 4667.46]  that's not
[4667.46 --> 4667.68]  the God
[4667.68 --> 4668.20]  I read about
[4668.20 --> 4669.36]  in the Bible.
[4670.18 --> 4670.72]  In short,
[4670.84 --> 4671.12]  if God
[4671.12 --> 4671.54]  were to see
[4671.54 --> 4672.02]  those things
[4672.02 --> 4672.58]  and then not
[4672.58 --> 4673.06]  deal with
[4673.06 --> 4673.22]  them,
[4673.36 --> 4673.80]  he would
[4673.80 --> 4674.36]  no longer
[4674.36 --> 4675.34]  be God.
[4675.42 --> 4675.76]  And that
[4675.76 --> 4676.44]  cannot
[4676.44 --> 4678.12]  be true.
[4679.68 --> 4679.96]  And so
[4679.96 --> 4680.30]  the real
[4680.30 --> 4681.34]  question for
[4681.34 --> 4682.50]  us as we
[4682.50 --> 4683.00]  enter into
[4683.00 --> 4683.60]  this moment
[4683.60 --> 4684.84]  is will
[4684.84 --> 4685.84]  our sins,
[4686.04 --> 4686.54]  will our
[4686.54 --> 4687.28]  darknesses,
[4687.34 --> 4687.62]  will the
[4687.62 --> 4688.52]  injustice of
[4688.52 --> 4688.92]  our own
[4688.92 --> 4689.26]  heart,
[4689.48 --> 4689.98]  will they
[4689.98 --> 4690.68]  be dealt
[4690.68 --> 4691.60]  with on
[4691.60 --> 4692.24]  the cross
[4692.24 --> 4693.26]  by Jesus
[4693.26 --> 4695.34]  or will
[4695.34 --> 4696.20]  they be dealt
[4696.20 --> 4697.20]  with on
[4697.20 --> 4697.54]  the day of
[4697.54 --> 4697.86]  judgment?
[4699.20 --> 4699.78]  Because make
[4699.78 --> 4700.38]  no mistake,
[4700.78 --> 4701.26]  because of
[4701.26 --> 4701.62]  who God
[4701.62 --> 4701.92]  is,
[4702.04 --> 4702.48]  they will
[4702.48 --> 4703.02]  be dealt
[4703.02 --> 4703.36]  with.
[4705.34 --> 4706.26]  The question
[4706.26 --> 4707.04]  of grace
[4707.04 --> 4707.54]  for us
[4707.54 --> 4708.10]  this morning
[4708.10 --> 4709.28]  is by
[4709.28 --> 4709.60]  whom?
[4711.92 --> 4712.82]  Who will
[4712.82 --> 4714.72]  deal with
[4714.72 --> 4714.96]  them?
[4716.24 --> 4716.88]  Because this
[4716.88 --> 4718.20]  is exactly
[4718.20 --> 4718.60]  where the
[4718.60 --> 4719.28]  gospel gets
[4719.28 --> 4719.80]  its legs.
[4720.66 --> 4721.10]  This is where
[4721.10 --> 4721.48]  the truth
[4721.48 --> 4721.82]  of God
[4721.82 --> 4722.54]  stands apart
[4722.54 --> 4723.26]  from any
[4723.26 --> 4723.80]  other news
[4723.80 --> 4724.02]  that you
[4724.02 --> 4724.30]  have ever
[4724.30 --> 4724.58]  heard.
[4725.94 --> 4726.92]  Hebrews 4
[4726.92 --> 4727.60]  verse 13
[4727.60 --> 4727.98]  says,
[4728.78 --> 4729.44]  nothing in
[4729.44 --> 4730.22]  all creation
[4730.22 --> 4730.64]  is hidden
[4730.64 --> 4731.38]  from God's
[4731.38 --> 4731.62]  sight.
[4732.08 --> 4732.46]  Everything
[4732.46 --> 4733.20]  is uncovered
[4733.20 --> 4733.94]  and laid
[4733.94 --> 4734.56]  bare before
[4734.56 --> 4735.26]  the eyes
[4735.26 --> 4735.64]  of him
[4735.64 --> 4736.28]  to whom
[4736.28 --> 4737.00]  we must
[4737.00 --> 4737.74]  give account.
[4738.14 --> 4738.68]  The question
[4738.68 --> 4739.06]  is,
[4739.74 --> 4740.46]  when God
[4740.46 --> 4740.84]  looks at
[4740.84 --> 4741.18]  you,
[4741.88 --> 4742.46]  will he
[4742.46 --> 4742.84]  see
[4742.84 --> 4743.94]  Jesus?
[4745.16 --> 4746.02]  Because that's
[4746.02 --> 4746.56]  what happens
[4746.56 --> 4747.30]  in the great
[4747.30 --> 4747.88]  exchange of
[4747.88 --> 4748.34]  the gospel.
[4748.94 --> 4749.88]  Jesus comes
[4749.88 --> 4750.44]  into the
[4750.44 --> 4750.80]  world and
[4750.80 --> 4751.48]  he lives
[4751.48 --> 4751.92]  the life
[4751.92 --> 4752.34]  I should
[4752.34 --> 4752.70]  have lived,
[4753.06 --> 4753.50]  perfectly
[4753.50 --> 4754.46]  keeping all
[4754.46 --> 4755.04]  the commands
[4755.04 --> 4755.72]  of God,
[4755.92 --> 4756.30]  perfectly
[4756.30 --> 4757.12]  living in
[4757.12 --> 4757.68]  righteousness
[4757.68 --> 4758.76]  every day
[4758.76 --> 4759.18]  and in
[4759.18 --> 4759.80]  every way.
[4760.16 --> 4760.40]  And by
[4760.40 --> 4761.04]  grace through
[4761.04 --> 4762.24]  faith unites
[4762.24 --> 4763.04]  me to
[4763.04 --> 4763.42]  his
[4763.42 --> 4764.16]  perfection.
[4765.08 --> 4766.12]  Faith grants
[4766.12 --> 4766.68]  me his
[4766.68 --> 4767.42]  perfection.
[4767.64 --> 4768.08]  The perfect
[4768.08 --> 4768.58]  righteousness
[4768.58 --> 4769.28]  of Jesus
[4769.28 --> 4769.96]  is counted
[4769.96 --> 4770.80]  in my
[4770.80 --> 4771.52]  place.
[4773.30 --> 4773.70]  And then,
[4774.58 --> 4776.30]  all those
[4776.30 --> 4776.88]  things that
[4776.88 --> 4777.56]  God sees
[4777.56 --> 4777.88]  when he
[4777.88 --> 4778.48]  looks at
[4778.48 --> 4779.48]  my heart,
[4779.54 --> 4779.72]  at the
[4779.72 --> 4780.78]  truth and
[4780.78 --> 4781.68]  the depths
[4781.68 --> 4782.12]  of my
[4782.12 --> 4782.40]  own
[4782.40 --> 4783.34]  brokenness
[4783.34 --> 4783.94]  and sin
[4783.94 --> 4784.50]  and darkness,
[4784.62 --> 4785.04]  all of
[4785.04 --> 4785.54]  those things
[4785.54 --> 4786.22]  that God
[4786.22 --> 4786.74]  sees when
[4786.74 --> 4787.16]  he looks
[4787.16 --> 4787.50]  into the
[4787.50 --> 4788.00]  very depths
[4788.00 --> 4788.46]  of my
[4788.46 --> 4788.92]  being,
[4788.92 --> 4789.76]  all of
[4789.76 --> 4790.38]  those things
[4790.38 --> 4791.46]  are given
[4791.46 --> 4791.90]  over to
[4791.90 --> 4792.84]  Christ on
[4792.84 --> 4793.38]  the cross
[4793.38 --> 4793.94]  as he
[4793.94 --> 4794.48]  bears the
[4794.48 --> 4794.92]  punishment
[4794.92 --> 4795.90]  for them,
[4795.94 --> 4796.38]  as he
[4796.38 --> 4797.08]  endures the
[4797.08 --> 4797.90]  death that
[4797.90 --> 4798.70]  I deserve.
[4800.12 --> 4800.64]  And when
[4800.64 --> 4801.08]  that is
[4801.08 --> 4801.50]  true for
[4801.50 --> 4801.80]  you,
[4802.74 --> 4803.68]  if that
[4803.68 --> 4804.12]  is true
[4804.12 --> 4804.64]  for you,
[4805.28 --> 4805.64]  then it's
[4805.64 --> 4806.18]  no wonder
[4806.18 --> 4806.96]  that we
[4806.96 --> 4807.44]  can say
[4807.44 --> 4807.92]  with the
[4807.92 --> 4808.28]  psalmist,
[4808.48 --> 4809.14]  how precious
[4809.14 --> 4809.72]  are your
[4809.72 --> 4810.04]  thoughts,
[4810.16 --> 4810.56]  oh God.
[4810.78 --> 4811.40]  No wonder
[4811.40 --> 4812.26]  we can say
[4812.26 --> 4812.68]  with the
[4812.68 --> 4812.98]  psalmist,
[4813.08 --> 4813.66]  I praise
[4813.66 --> 4814.10]  you because
[4814.10 --> 4814.40]  I am
[4814.40 --> 4814.94]  fearfully
[4814.94 --> 4815.86]  and wonderfully
[4815.86 --> 4816.16]  made.
[4816.22 --> 4816.62]  No wonder
[4816.62 --> 4817.42]  we can say
[4817.42 --> 4817.74]  with the
[4817.74 --> 4818.04]  psalmist,
[4818.20 --> 4819.06]  such knowledge
[4819.06 --> 4819.92]  is too
[4819.92 --> 4820.42]  wonderful
[4820.42 --> 4821.34]  for me.
[4822.50 --> 4822.74]  You see,
[4822.80 --> 4823.28]  the gospel
[4823.28 --> 4823.82]  of Jesus
[4823.82 --> 4824.92]  brings comfort
[4824.92 --> 4825.60]  and peace
[4825.60 --> 4826.38]  because God
[4826.38 --> 4827.86]  sees everything
[4827.86 --> 4828.98]  in you
[4828.98 --> 4830.24]  and he
[4830.24 --> 4831.62]  loves you.
[4834.18 --> 4835.12]  He has
[4835.12 --> 4835.66]  shown you
[4835.66 --> 4836.28]  that love
[4836.28 --> 4837.54]  in Jesus
[4837.54 --> 4838.02]  Christ.
[4839.24 --> 4839.94]  The gospel
[4839.94 --> 4840.70]  brings comfort
[4840.70 --> 4841.36]  and peace
[4841.36 --> 4842.24]  because God
[4842.24 --> 4843.02]  is present
[4843.02 --> 4844.12]  with you
[4844.12 --> 4845.16]  everywhere
[4845.16 --> 4846.72]  knowing what
[4846.72 --> 4847.26]  it is
[4847.26 --> 4848.16]  to feel
[4848.16 --> 4848.74]  and to
[4848.74 --> 4849.40]  experience
[4849.40 --> 4849.76]  knowing
[4849.76 --> 4850.22]  whatever
[4850.22 --> 4850.78]  it is
[4850.78 --> 4851.34]  you feel
[4851.34 --> 4852.36]  and experience
[4852.36 --> 4852.92]  and he
[4852.92 --> 4853.54]  has shown
[4853.54 --> 4853.94]  you that
[4853.94 --> 4854.44]  truth
[4854.44 --> 4855.40]  in Jesus
[4855.40 --> 4855.88]  Christ.
[4856.96 --> 4857.82]  The only
[4857.82 --> 4858.66]  question left
[4858.66 --> 4859.10]  is how
[4859.10 --> 4859.76]  will you
[4859.76 --> 4860.62]  respond?
[4862.06 --> 4862.56]  In this
[4862.56 --> 4862.92]  place
[4862.92 --> 4863.22]  we
[4863.22 --> 4864.04]  worship.
[4864.96 --> 4865.48]  Together
[4865.48 --> 4866.06]  we gather
[4866.06 --> 4866.40]  and we
[4866.40 --> 4867.00]  give God
[4867.00 --> 4868.00]  glory but
[4868.00 --> 4868.82]  your response
[4868.82 --> 4870.08]  also matters
[4870.08 --> 4870.46]  when you
[4870.46 --> 4871.14]  go from
[4871.14 --> 4871.52]  this
[4871.52 --> 4872.28]  place.
[4872.28 --> 4874.36]  David
[4874.36 --> 4874.76]  says
[4874.76 --> 4876.70]  do I
[4876.70 --> 4877.16]  not hate
[4877.16 --> 4877.64]  those
[4877.64 --> 4878.36]  who hate
[4878.36 --> 4878.52]  you
[4878.52 --> 4878.76]  Lord
[4878.76 --> 4879.74]  and
[4879.74 --> 4880.08]  abhor
[4880.08 --> 4880.46]  those
[4880.46 --> 4880.60]  who
[4880.60 --> 4880.76]  are
[4880.76 --> 4880.88]  in
[4880.88 --> 4881.22]  rebellion
[4881.22 --> 4881.62]  against
[4881.62 --> 4881.92]  you?
[4883.36 --> 4883.66]  Because

[4902.68 --> 4903.18]  way
[4903.18 --> 4903.72]  in

[4905.20 --> 4905.56]  way
[4905.56 --> 4906.62]  everlasting.
[4908.34 --> 4908.98]  Our
[4908.98 --> 4909.50]  life
[4909.50 --> 4909.88]  lived
[4909.88 --> 4910.30]  together
[4910.30 --> 4910.70]  and
[4910.70 --> 4910.94]  out
[4910.94 --> 4911.18]  in
[4911.18 --> 4911.34]  the
[4911.34 --> 4911.64]  world
[4911.64 --> 4912.00]  ought

[4913.70 --> 4914.34]  aroma
[4914.34 --> 4914.62]  to
[4914.62 --> 4914.78]  the
[4914.78 --> 4915.02]  Lord.
[4916.38 --> 4916.94]  That's
[4916.94 --> 4917.42]  how
[4917.42 --> 4917.82]  and why
[4917.82 --> 4918.28]  worship
[4918.28 --> 4918.94]  starts
[4918.94 --> 4919.36]  here
[4919.36 --> 4919.82]  in
[4919.82 --> 4920.06]  this
[4920.06 --> 4920.36]  place
[4920.36 --> 4920.54]  but
[4920.54 --> 4920.76]  that's
[4920.76 --> 4921.06]  also
[4921.06 --> 4921.34]  how
[4921.34 --> 4921.58]  it
[4921.58 --> 4921.82]  then
[4921.82 --> 4922.58]  continues
[4922.58 --> 4923.30]  for

[4925.12 --> 4925.52]  again.
[4925.52 --> 4930.16]  maybe
[4930.16 --> 4931.44]  today
[4931.44 --> 4933.06]  it's
[4933.06 --> 4933.40]  time
[4933.40 --> 4933.62]  to
[4933.62 --> 4934.00]  stop
[4934.00 --> 4934.66]  hiding
[4934.66 --> 4935.46]  under
[4935.46 --> 4935.66]  a

[4936.18 --> 4936.42]  made
[4936.42 --> 4936.72]  tote
[4936.72 --> 4939.10]  because

[4939.28 --> 4939.60]  sees
[4939.60 --> 4939.84]  you.

[4944.66 --> 4944.90]  By

[4949.08 --> 4949.62]  God

[4952.26 --> 4952.88]  nor
[4952.88 --> 4953.30]  forsake
[4953.30 --> 4953.48]  you
[4953.48 --> 4953.58]  and

[5885.72 --> 5891.10]  Can make my spirit whole
[5891.10 --> 5897.08]  Not what I feel or do
[5897.08 --> 5903.70]  Can give me peace with God
[5903.70 --> 5910.58]  Not all my prayers and sighs and tears
[5910.58 --> 5916.46]  Can bear my awful Lord
[5916.46 --> 5922.70]  Your voice alone, O Lord
[5923.26 --> 5929.08]  Can speak to me of grace

[5959.96 --> 5965.08]  Can bear me safely through
[5965.08 --> 5973.16]  I praise the Christ of God
[5973.16 --> 5977.84]  I rest on the divine
[5977.84 --> 5985.24]  And with unfolding lip and heart
[5985.24 --> 5991.90]  I call this Savior God
[5991.90 --> 5997.24]  My Lord has saved my life
[5997.24 --> 6002.24]  And freely pardoned gifts
[6002.24 --> 6009.32]  I love because He first loved me
[6009.32 --> 6016.44]  I live because He lives
[6016.44 --> 6025.10]  And with tomb and weeks
[6025.10 --> 6026.54]  I pray and love with Jesus
[6026.54 --> 6026.94]  The grace of God
[6026.94 --> 6026.98]  And with eternal eternal salvation
[6026.98 --> 6027.76]  Until He says love
[6028.44 --> 6028.72]  It will not let him
[6028.72 --> 6029.90]  Yes, that is what he has
[6029.90 --> 6030.70]  In the final틀
[6030.70 --> 6035.08]  And否
[6035.08 --> 6061.88]  My Lord, what love is this
[6061.88 --> 6069.18]  That pays so dearly
[6069.18 --> 6077.10]  That I, the guilty one
[6077.10 --> 6083.62]  May your faith
[6083.62 --> 6089.50]  Amazing love, oh what sacrifice
[6089.50 --> 6096.50]  The Son of God, here for me
[6097.12 --> 6100.78]  My death He pays
[6100.78 --> 6104.50]  And my death He dies
[6104.50 --> 6110.50]  That I might live
[6110.50 --> 6117.50]  That I might live
[6117.50 --> 6129.58]  And so they watched Him die
[6129.58 --> 6135.16]  Despised, rejected
[6135.16 --> 6144.32]  But oh, the blood He shed
[6144.32 --> 6149.32]  For me
[6149.32 --> 6157.32]  Amazing love, oh what sacrifice
[6157.32 --> 6164.32]  The Son of God, give for me
[6164.32 --> 6167.32]  My death He pays
[6167.32 --> 6171.32]  And my death He dies
[6171.32 --> 6177.32]  That I might live
[6177.32 --> 6183.32]  That I might live
[6183.32 --> 6190.32]  And now
[6190.32 --> 6196.32]  This love of Christ
[6196.94 --> 6198.32]  Shall flow
[6198.32 --> 6203.32]  Like rivers
[6203.32 --> 6210.32]  Come wash your guilt away
[6210.32 --> 6213.32]  Live
[6213.32 --> 6214.32]  Live
[6214.32 --> 6217.32]  Amen
[6217.32 --> 6223.32]  Amazing love, oh what sacrifice
[6223.32 --> 6230.32]  The Son of God, give for me
[6230.32 --> 6234.32]  My death He pays
[6234.32 --> 6238.32]  And my death He dies
[6238.32 --> 6244.32]  That I, I live
[6244.32 --> 6249.32]  That I, I live
[6249.32 --> 6252.32]  That I, I live
[6252.32 --> 6262.32]  That I, I live
[6262.32 --> 6265.32]  That I, I live
[6265.32 --> 6269.32]  That I, I live
[6269.32 --> 6270.32]  That I love
[6270.32 --> 6294.60]  Before the throne of God above
[6294.60 --> 6300.18]  I have a strong and perfect plea
[6300.18 --> 6305.50]  A great high priest whose name is love
[6305.50 --> 6310.96]  Whoever lives and pleads for me
[6310.96 --> 6316.48]  My name is written on his hands
[6316.48 --> 6321.92]  My name is written on his heart
[6321.92 --> 6327.06]  I know that while in heaven he stands
[6327.06 --> 6331.92]  No tongue can bid me thence depart
[6331.92 --> 6336.92]  No tongue can bid me thence depart
[6336.92 --> 6349.92]  When Satan tempts me to despair
[6349.92 --> 6356.06]  And tells me of the guilt within
[6356.06 --> 6361.24]  Upward I look and see him there
[6361.24 --> 6366.62]  Who made an end of all my sin
[6366.62 --> 6371.24]  Because the sinless Savior died
[6371.84 --> 6376.24]  My sinful soul is counted free
[6376.80 --> 6381.24]  For God the just is satisfied
[6381.24 --> 6387.24]  To look on him and pardon me
[6387.24 --> 6392.24]  To look on him and pardon me
[6392.24 --> 6405.24]  Behold him there the risen Lamb
[6405.24 --> 6410.24]  My perfect spotless righteousness
[6410.24 --> 6416.24]  The great unchangeable I am
[6416.24 --> 6422.24]  The King of glory and of grace
[6422.24 --> 6426.24]  One in himself I cannot die
[6426.24 --> 6432.24]  My soul is purchased by his blood
[6432.24 --> 6437.24]  My life is hid with Christ on high
[6437.24 --> 6442.24]  With Christ my Savior and my God
[6442.24 --> 6447.24]  With Christ my Savior and my God
[6447.24 --> 6454.24]  With Christ my Savior and my God
[6454.24 --> 6464.24]  My life is hid with Christ on high
[6464.24 --> 6469.24]  With Christ my Savior and my God
[6469.24 --> 6476.24]  With Christ my Savior and my God
[6476.24 --> 6486.24]  You willOLD outer to the land
[6486.24 --> 6490.24]  All over my grace where He stands
[6491.24 --> 6492.24]  and may now, with His sign
[6496.24 --> 6496.54]  He will upon your grace
[6496.54 --> 6522.62]  O to see the dawn of the darkest day
[6522.62 --> 6530.62]  Christ on a road to Calvary
[6530.62 --> 6536.52]  Tried by sinful land
[6536.52 --> 6540.94]  Torn and beaten land
[6540.94 --> 6548.36]  Nailed to a cross of wood
[6548.36 --> 6557.62]  This the path of the cross
[6557.62 --> 6560.36]  Christ became
[6560.36 --> 6565.36]  Sin for us
[6566.08 --> 6569.36]  Took the blame
[6569.36 --> 6575.68]  For the wrath we stand forgiven
[6575.68 --> 6579.36]  At the cross
[6579.36 --> 6592.06]  Won't you see the pain
[6592.06 --> 6596.58]  Written on your face
[6596.58 --> 6604.62]  Bearing the awesome weight of sin
[6604.62 --> 6609.62]  Every bitter thought
[6609.62 --> 6613.88]  Every evil deed
[6613.88 --> 6617.52]  Counting your blood
[6617.52 --> 6620.62]  Stay proud
[6620.62 --> 6624.62]  This the hope
[6624.62 --> 6628.62]  Of the cross
[6628.62 --> 6631.62]  Christ became
[6631.62 --> 6636.62]  Sin for us
[6636.62 --> 6640.62]  Took the blame
[6640.62 --> 6645.62]  For the wrath we stand
[6645.62 --> 6646.62]  For the grace
[6646.62 --> 6647.36]  For the grace of God
[6647.36 --> 6654.88]  And the grace of God
[6654.88 --> 6662.80]  Now the daylight flees
[6662.80 --> 6667.12]  Now the brown beef
[6667.12 --> 6675.76]  Quakes as its maker bows its head
[6675.76 --> 6680.00]  Curtain torn in two
[6680.00 --> 6684.24]  Dead are raised to the light
[6684.24 --> 6691.44]  Finish the victory cry
[6691.44 --> 6699.28]  This the heart of the cross
[6699.28 --> 6707.24]  Christ became sin for us
[6707.24 --> 6711.20]  Took the pain
[6711.20 --> 6721.14]  For the wrath we stand forgiven at the cross
[6721.14 --> 6732.36]  Oh, to see my name
[6732.36 --> 6736.76]  Written in the wounds
[6736.76 --> 6740.80]  For through your suffering
[6740.80 --> 6744.76]  I am free
[6744.76 --> 6749.48]  Death is crushed to death
[6751.14 --> 6753.76]  It's right to live
[6753.76 --> 6760.36]  Born with your selfless love
[6760.36 --> 6768.78]  This the heart of the cross
[6768.78 --> 6771.40]  Son of God
[6771.40 --> 6776.44]  Sing for us
[6776.44 --> 6780.00]  Water of all
[6780.00 --> 6782.00]  Water of all
[6782.00 --> 6785.26]  Peace that forgiven
