[132.86 --> 136.36]  For now, His spirit.
[136.36 --> 141.36]  He washed me in blood.
[141.36 --> 147.74]  In whom can He do the Savior's light?
[148.00 --> 152.32]  Did He spell my thoughts in the blackest night?
[152.58 --> 156.86]  Did He part His power to my soul redeem?

[344.66 --> 351.66]  This next song is new to us.
[351.66 --> 352.66]  And it is a little peppy.
[352.66 --> 358.66]  So feel free to listen along and join us if you get used to the melody.
[358.66 --> 365.66]  Or just listen because it has a lot of truths about what we've been learning.

[410.66 --> 419.66]  The risen raining at the Father's sky.
[419.66 --> 425.66]  His foolishness to those who cannot see.
[425.66 --> 432.66]  Blinded by the hearts they can't believe.
[432.66 --> 433.66]  The risen rain.
[433.66 --> 435.66]  So let the church arise.
[435.66 --> 439.66]  Let the anthem ring.
[439.66 --> 443.66]  To all the world's pastors.

[546.36 --> 549.38]  The holy we shall sing
[549.38 --> 552.42]  The home of all the world
[552.42 --> 556.12]  The Christ the risen King

[569.42 --> 574.46]  Yes, we, we are not ashamed
[574.46 --> 582.22]  Oh, we have no other Savior to sustain
[582.22 --> 587.46]  Oh, we, we are not ashamed
[587.46 --> 591.26]  Oh, we have no other Savior to sustain
[591.26 --> 599.14]  Yes, we, we are not ashamed
[599.14 --> 603.10]  Oh, we have no other Savior to sustain
[603.10 --> 618.74]  Oh, we are not ashamed
[618.74 --> 627.26]  Good morning, everybody.
[627.54 --> 631.60]  Can I have all the preschoolers up to grade four come up to the front?
[631.92 --> 638.24]  And while they're coming up to the front, we have a couple weeks left in our regular season,
[638.24 --> 642.12]  and we are starting to look for people for our summer season.
[642.12 --> 650.18]  So if anybody's interested in teaching the preschoolers, we have a link on our bulletin that you can just sign in on,
[650.42 --> 653.42]  or you can come talk to me if you have any other questions.
[654.46 --> 656.06]  Good morning, guys. How are you?
[656.94 --> 662.30]  So today we're going to start a new session, and it's called Campfire.
[662.76 --> 666.18]  So when we sit around a campfire, what kind of things do we do?
[667.74 --> 668.12]  Okay.
[669.24 --> 670.24]  You tell stories?
[670.24 --> 672.52]  What else do we do around a campfire?
[676.18 --> 677.32]  Roast marshmallows.
[677.50 --> 678.36]  What else do we do?
[680.16 --> 683.58]  Around a campfire, maybe, but not too close.
[684.56 --> 685.70]  What else do we do?
[685.92 --> 687.48]  We hang out with our family.
[687.66 --> 691.38]  We hang out with friends, and we have discussions.
[692.14 --> 692.84]  Pardon me, Malachi?
[693.54 --> 695.72]  We sit around the campfire and have discussions.
[695.72 --> 703.22]  So basically, in the next couple of weeks until this, until summertime, is we are going to talk about different topics.
[703.80 --> 706.10]  So today, we are going to talk about prayer.
[706.56 --> 714.56]  So we are going to learn, we're going to learn about the story that we, that Jesus taught his disciples how to pray,
[714.66 --> 716.70]  and we're going to talk about the Lord's Prayer.
[716.70 --> 718.30]  So can everybody stand up?
[722.62 --> 725.06]  And look at your parents and the congregation.
[725.06 --> 729.62]  And one, two, three, the Lord be with you.
[729.82 --> 731.50]  And also with you.
[731.50 --> 756.50]  Thank you.
[756.50 --> 757.50]  Good morning.
[757.50 --> 758.50]  My name is Ken.
[758.50 --> 763.50]  I'm an elder here at Emanuel, and I will be leading us in our church family prayer.
[763.50 --> 770.50]  So all of you should have access to the e-bulletin, and every week we see numerous items for prayer
[770.50 --> 774.80]  requests, and I encourage each of us to look at those not only on Sunday, but just throughout
[774.80 --> 778.18]  the week and keep each other upheld in prayer.
[778.18 --> 783.50]  In addition to the items in the bulletin right now, there's one other situation or announcement
[783.50 --> 789.44]  I have, and many of you would know, Dennis DeGroote, who was a teacher at Fraser Valley
[789.44 --> 794.64]  Christian and Surrey Christian, and he passed away on Friday.
[794.64 --> 801.26]  And so there's going to be a service, a memorial for him on Friday, this coming Friday at 2
[801.26 --> 804.18]  p.m. at Fleetwood CRC.
[804.18 --> 808.56]  So let's all uphold the DeGroote family in our prayers as well.
[808.56 --> 810.12]  Let's bow our heads together.
[810.12 --> 819.50]  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, all your works shall praise your name in earth and sky
[819.50 --> 821.12]  and sea.
[821.12 --> 825.70]  What a blessing it is to worship you this morning and to praise your holy name.
[825.70 --> 831.60]  In our singing songs of praise, in the teaching and hearing of your word, in fellowship, in
[831.60 --> 835.96]  breaking bread, and in prayer, we praise you, Lord our God.
[835.96 --> 840.04]  We cry out, hallelujah, all we have is Christ.
[840.04 --> 843.14]  Hallelujah, Jesus is our life.
[843.14 --> 849.66]  Lord, when we examine our lives, we see blessings beyond what we can count, and your grace beyond
[849.66 --> 851.70]  what we can measure.
[851.70 --> 855.64]  We can give you all the glory and praise to you alone.
[855.64 --> 860.54]  But still, we find ourselves carrying burdens that make us tired and weary.
[860.54 --> 864.74]  Lord, we lift up our burdens to you, knowing that you are the creator of the ends of the
[864.74 --> 865.92]  earth.
[865.92 --> 871.82]  You will not grow tired or weary, and your understanding is beyond our comprehension.
[871.82 --> 876.42]  Lord, you give us strength to the weary and increase the power of the weak.
[876.42 --> 881.60]  This morning we lift up our praise and concerns to you, knowing that those who hope in the Lord,
[881.60 --> 885.54]  will renew their strength and soar on wings like eagles.
[885.54 --> 889.96]  We will run and not grow weary, walk and not be faint.
[889.96 --> 893.58]  We thank you, Lord, for the opportunities and blessings you have provided throughout this
[893.58 --> 896.92]  school year to students and to their teachers.
[896.92 --> 901.48]  We ask you for strength to enable them to finish this school year well.
[901.48 --> 905.48]  We pray, Lord, that you provide discernment and guidance for all who are seeking out what
[905.48 --> 910.80]  to do in the next chapter of their lives after the school year ends.
[910.80 --> 914.74]  We thank you for our communities, this beautiful province, and our nation.
[914.74 --> 918.04]  Lord, we have so many opportunities and privileges.
[918.04 --> 920.78]  Help us not take them for granted.
[920.78 --> 927.18]  We pray for your world and many places that are suffering in a time of injustice, hunger,
[927.18 --> 928.66]  and war.
[928.66 --> 933.20]  Help us not lose sight of the ministry and mission you have for your church in this time
[933.20 --> 936.60]  and place and throughout the world.
[936.60 --> 941.48]  Lord, we celebrate with the Agile family as they have become Canadian citizens.
[941.48 --> 946.10]  As we have walked this process with them over the years, we see your faithfulness and guidance
[946.10 --> 950.14]  and praise you for all you have done in this.
[950.14 --> 953.52]  We pray, Lord, for those who are dealing with burdens of illness.
[953.52 --> 959.32]  Lord, you sustain them on their sick bed and restore them from their beds of illness.
[959.32 --> 964.70]  We lift up Kobe DeBoersap as she continues radiation and chemo treatment after bone marrow and stem
[964.70 --> 966.86]  cell transplants.
[966.86 --> 970.40]  Lord, we pray for strength and peace for Kobe and her family.
[970.40 --> 976.24]  Grant Kobe a return to strength and health and recovery from this leukemia.
[976.24 --> 981.72]  We pray, Lord, for Everly Vartstra and ask for complete healing for her melanoma.
[981.72 --> 988.32]  Please grant Stephen and Karen your peace and patience in these times of testing and waiting.
[988.32 --> 993.22]  We ask for wisdom for the medical teams that provide treatment and care to Everly.
[993.22 --> 997.86]  We're grateful, Lord, to hear positive reports this week and pray for continued healing along
[997.86 --> 1002.14]  this long road to full healing for Everly.
[1002.14 --> 1007.42]  We also pray for Rose Vita as she faces health challenges and other struggles.
[1007.42 --> 1011.04]  Lord, give her your healing touch and renew her strength.
[1011.04 --> 1015.46]  We pray for Judy Dykstra's friend, Vera, who has been struggling with shingles for a long
[1015.46 --> 1016.98]  time.
[1016.98 --> 1020.90]  Please grant her healing and relief and help her get the support that she needs in this
[1020.90 --> 1022.62]  time.
[1022.62 --> 1027.22]  We also lift up Lena who had a fall and required stitches this week, Lord, and we ask for quick
[1027.22 --> 1029.22]  healing for her as well.
[1029.22 --> 1034.18]  Lord, we pray for others who are dealing with illness in our congregation or in our circles
[1034.18 --> 1038.12]  of connections, many that we know of and some that we do not.
[1038.12 --> 1042.64]  Lord, we pray that you'd help us remain confident that we will see the goodness of the Lord in
[1042.64 --> 1044.40]  the land of the living.
[1044.40 --> 1049.50]  Help us be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord in all of these things.
[1049.50 --> 1054.74]  Lord, we also lift up those who are grieving loved ones who have passed away.
[1054.74 --> 1059.44]  We thank especially of the DeGroote family as they're in a time of mourning and pray your
[1059.44 --> 1063.64]  blessing on the memorial service this upcoming Friday.
[1063.64 --> 1070.38]  Lord, we lift up our church, this church family here and our ministry here at Emanuel and throughout
[1070.38 --> 1071.74]  our region and denomination.
[1072.46 --> 1077.54]  We pray for the work of our church council and staff, our classes and synod.
[1078.06 --> 1082.72]  Lord, please be near to each of the workers that you have put in place to lead.
[1082.72 --> 1089.30]  As synod begins later this week, we pray for all the delegates and we pray for Pastor Chris
[1089.30 --> 1093.90]  and Sean from New Life and Sonia from Willoughby as they are leaving for synod this week.
[1094.54 --> 1099.18]  And as they prepare for some significant and important conversations and work to be done.
[1100.04 --> 1105.64]  Holy Spirit, we ask that you work in the hearts and minds of the delegates to lead them.
[1106.16 --> 1112.08]  Help them correctly handle the word of truth and boldly lead your church to do likewise.
[1112.72 --> 1117.84]  Lord, this morning as we hear your word and share in the Lord's Supper around the table,
[1118.24 --> 1122.54]  we pray that you will speak into our hearts and lives in old and new ways alike.
[1123.16 --> 1123.56]  Hallelujah.
[1124.14 --> 1125.66]  All we have is Christ.
[1126.30 --> 1126.70]  Hallelujah.
[1127.24 --> 1128.48]  Jesus is our life.
[1128.98 --> 1129.20]  Amen.
[1129.20 --> 1129.30]  Amen.
[1142.72 --> 1158.24]  This morning we are going to close out our series in the book of Romans.
[1158.24 --> 1165.60]  If you are a guest with us this morning, we have been living in the book of Romans for the last year and a half.
[1165.60 --> 1167.16]  18 months.
[1168.00 --> 1175.70]  39 sermons including today and lots of conversations and this past year starting in January.
[1176.18 --> 1177.40]  Podcasts and the like.
[1178.70 --> 1181.28]  And so I want to say first of all, thank you.
[1181.80 --> 1184.94]  Thank you for your encouragement and your feedback and for your engagement.
[1184.94 --> 1193.40]  Thank you for pressing into the challenges and for wrestling and for allowing us to go on this road.
[1193.76 --> 1201.22]  To Josh and Kevin as well, thank you for your participation in this and for taking this challenge up with me.
[1201.76 --> 1206.86]  I have been truly blessed and I know at least three of you have been as well.
[1207.60 --> 1210.84]  And so hopefully it's more, but thank you for your gracious feedback.
[1210.84 --> 1220.38]  Someone asked me a little while ago if we could provide an overview of the series with the texts and with the big idea from each sermon.
[1220.98 --> 1223.20]  And so we have a few of these available.
[1223.42 --> 1227.06]  They're cards that you can just slip in your Bible, maybe at the beginning of Romans.
[1227.50 --> 1231.52]  And you can go and hold it alongside of what you have there.
[1231.60 --> 1234.20]  And so we printed 40 of these.
[1234.88 --> 1237.00]  I'm not sure we will need all 40.
[1237.00 --> 1241.78]  But if we happen to run out, just touch base with me and I'll get the office to print off some more.
[1242.18 --> 1244.38]  They're at the Connect booth later.
[1245.88 --> 1250.56]  We're going to end today with just three verses.
[1250.84 --> 1256.28]  And so we're going to read together from Romans 16, 25 through 27.
[1256.54 --> 1259.60]  If you have a Bible, of course, I encourage you to open that up.
[1259.68 --> 1260.42]  Keep that in front of you.
[1260.52 --> 1262.06]  There are Bibles available at the back.
[1262.14 --> 1265.78]  You can also get it on your phone or whatever device you have there.
[1265.78 --> 1268.36]  The first time through, at least, it should be over my shoulder.
[1268.92 --> 1269.64]  Let's read together.
[1272.16 --> 1277.54]  Now to him who is able to establish you in accordance with my gospel,
[1277.94 --> 1280.80]  the message I proclaim about Jesus Christ,
[1280.80 --> 1285.32]  in keeping with the revelation of the mystery hidden for long ages past,
[1285.60 --> 1291.50]  but now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings by the command of the eternal God,
[1291.64 --> 1295.34]  so that all the Gentiles might come to the obedience that comes from faith,
[1295.34 --> 1301.62]  to the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ.
[1302.38 --> 1302.76]  Amen.
[1304.30 --> 1305.54]  This is the word of the Lord.
[1310.24 --> 1313.60]  So this morning, as our sort of weigh in,
[1313.60 --> 1314.72]  I want to ask the question,
[1315.12 --> 1320.04]  how would you end perhaps the greatest letter ever written?
[1320.04 --> 1323.72]  Now throughout this series on Romans,
[1324.18 --> 1329.02]  we've been talking about and in hearing about the impact of this letter,
[1329.12 --> 1330.34]  this book of the Bible.
[1331.12 --> 1333.34]  Pastor Kevin, in one of his messages,
[1333.88 --> 1337.28]  shared how Bible scholars say that
[1337.28 --> 1341.82]  in this letter is the most important paragraph ever written,
[1342.16 --> 1343.24]  is how Kevin put it.
[1343.24 --> 1349.08]  A verse from this letter changed the course of church history.
[1349.42 --> 1350.68]  Romans 1 verse 17.
[1350.80 --> 1351.82]  We'll see that in a little bit.
[1352.24 --> 1354.36]  Three chapters from this letter
[1354.36 --> 1357.46]  have shaped conversations in biblical theology
[1357.46 --> 1359.58]  for literally millennia.
[1360.60 --> 1362.02]  That's chapters 9 through 11.
[1363.28 --> 1363.88]  Personally,
[1364.22 --> 1366.18]  my favorite chapter in the whole Bible
[1366.18 --> 1367.52]  is in the book of Romans.
[1368.50 --> 1370.10]  Maybe yours is too,
[1370.10 --> 1371.92]  because a lot of people love Romans 8.
[1374.18 --> 1374.80]  And so,
[1375.54 --> 1376.96]  Tony Merida asks,
[1377.36 --> 1381.56]  how do you end the greatest letter ever written?
[1383.04 --> 1385.08]  And the answer that I hope we'll see
[1385.08 --> 1388.56]  is the same way you started it.
[1389.72 --> 1391.38]  The same way you started it.
[1391.44 --> 1391.52]  Right?
[1391.58 --> 1392.48]  From the beginning,
[1393.14 --> 1394.60]  the letter to the Romans
[1394.60 --> 1397.32]  has been about one thing.
[1398.58 --> 1401.52]  The gospel of Jesus Christ.
[1402.74 --> 1402.90]  Right?
[1402.94 --> 1404.82]  From the deep, unsettling truth
[1404.82 --> 1406.64]  of our need for the gospel
[1406.64 --> 1407.56]  to the reality
[1407.56 --> 1408.76]  of how the gospel
[1408.76 --> 1411.00]  works out in the order of salvation
[1411.00 --> 1411.84]  to the truth
[1411.84 --> 1413.10]  of how the gospel continues
[1413.10 --> 1414.16]  to work itself out
[1414.16 --> 1415.26]  in the lives of those
[1415.26 --> 1416.76]  who are transformed by it
[1416.76 --> 1417.34]  and the truth
[1417.34 --> 1418.46]  of how the gospel
[1418.46 --> 1420.76]  shapes the community of people
[1420.76 --> 1422.58]  who are made by it.
[1423.30 --> 1423.44]  Right?
[1423.44 --> 1425.16]  These themes are found
[1425.16 --> 1427.14]  throughout the entire letter.
[1427.26 --> 1428.08]  And what we have said
[1428.08 --> 1429.06]  over and over
[1429.06 --> 1429.94]  is that Romans
[1429.94 --> 1431.74]  from first to last
[1431.74 --> 1434.10]  has been about the gospel.
[1435.86 --> 1437.36]  You end the letter
[1437.36 --> 1439.04]  the same way you started.
[1439.90 --> 1440.38]  In fact,
[1440.50 --> 1441.48]  the language of
[1441.48 --> 1444.20]  verses 25 through 27
[1444.20 --> 1446.08]  echo the language
[1446.08 --> 1449.30]  of the first five verses
[1449.30 --> 1450.40]  of the book.
[1450.40 --> 1453.58]  There's a nice bookend
[1453.58 --> 1454.70]  to the way Paul
[1454.70 --> 1456.56]  concludes this letter.
[1457.22 --> 1458.44]  Did we have this image, Linda?
[1461.44 --> 1463.12]  So, you can see
[1463.12 --> 1465.80]  maybe
[1465.80 --> 1477.26]  the first five books
[1477.26 --> 1478.02]  of the Bible
[1478.02 --> 1478.88]  have themes
[1478.88 --> 1479.88]  that correspond
[1479.88 --> 1480.74]  Linda can get it up
[1480.74 --> 1481.44]  as she gets it
[1481.44 --> 1483.84]  to these ones here.
[1485.30 --> 1485.54]  Right?
[1485.58 --> 1486.88]  In the first five verses
[1486.88 --> 1488.90]  and in these last three verses
[1488.90 --> 1490.74]  Paul talks about the gospel.
[1490.88 --> 1492.26]  He talks about being set apart
[1492.26 --> 1493.84]  for the gospel.
[1493.84 --> 1495.84]  Right?
[1495.88 --> 1497.48]  He grounds this gospel
[1497.48 --> 1499.28]  in the person
[1499.28 --> 1500.86]  and work of Jesus Christ.
[1501.84 --> 1502.72]  And he shows
[1502.72 --> 1504.02]  how this gospel
[1504.02 --> 1505.38]  has been God's plan
[1505.38 --> 1506.40]  all along
[1506.40 --> 1507.66]  revealed in the writings
[1507.66 --> 1508.30]  of the prophets
[1508.30 --> 1509.38]  and in the writings
[1509.38 --> 1510.20]  of Holy Scripture.
[1511.30 --> 1512.18]  The purpose
[1512.18 --> 1513.72]  has been
[1513.72 --> 1514.52]  always
[1514.52 --> 1515.66]  so that
[1515.66 --> 1516.62]  the Gentiles
[1516.62 --> 1517.32]  that is people
[1517.32 --> 1518.28]  who are not Jewish
[1518.28 --> 1519.58]  you and me
[1519.58 --> 1521.18]  might come to
[1521.18 --> 1522.18]  obedience
[1522.18 --> 1523.06]  that comes
[1523.06 --> 1524.22]  from faith.
[1525.08 --> 1525.38]  In fact,
[1525.46 --> 1525.88]  if you hold
[1525.88 --> 1526.64]  these two things
[1526.64 --> 1527.68]  side by each
[1527.68 --> 1529.52]  it's pretty masterful
[1529.52 --> 1530.30]  letter writing
[1530.30 --> 1531.64]  that's going on here.
[1533.28 --> 1533.90]  But
[1533.90 --> 1535.70]  what is
[1535.70 --> 1536.70]  specifically
[1536.70 --> 1538.14]  unique
[1538.14 --> 1539.46]  about
[1539.46 --> 1540.36]  verses 25
[1540.36 --> 1541.20]  through 27
[1541.20 --> 1542.70]  is how Paul
[1542.70 --> 1543.96]  then surrounds
[1543.96 --> 1544.62]  this
[1544.62 --> 1545.52]  repeated
[1545.52 --> 1546.72]  message.
[1547.92 --> 1548.32]  Right?
[1548.32 --> 1550.00]  this call
[1550.00 --> 1551.20]  is to
[1551.20 --> 1551.96]  surround
[1551.96 --> 1553.02]  the gospel
[1553.02 --> 1554.86]  with doxology
[1554.86 --> 1556.20]  with words
[1556.20 --> 1557.04]  of praise
[1557.04 --> 1558.22]  and of blessing.
[1559.04 --> 1559.12]  Right?
[1559.12 --> 1559.98]  Notice how he starts
[1559.98 --> 1560.70]  our text.
[1560.82 --> 1561.08]  He says
[1561.08 --> 1562.18]  now to him
[1562.18 --> 1562.92]  who is able
[1562.92 --> 1564.10]  to establish you
[1564.10 --> 1564.72]  in accordance
[1564.72 --> 1566.16]  with my gospel.
[1566.26 --> 1567.10]  And then he continues
[1567.10 --> 1568.36]  as we have seen
[1568.36 --> 1569.52]  repeating themes
[1569.52 --> 1570.28]  from the first
[1570.28 --> 1571.34]  five verses
[1571.34 --> 1572.08]  of the letter
[1572.08 --> 1573.50]  and then he comes
[1573.50 --> 1574.38]  back to
[1574.38 --> 1575.08]  this idea
[1575.08 --> 1576.00]  of doxology.
[1576.56 --> 1576.68]  Right?
[1577.28 --> 1578.46]  Now to him
[1578.46 --> 1579.42]  the wise
[1579.42 --> 1580.02]  God
[1580.02 --> 1580.74]  be glory
[1580.74 --> 1581.42]  forever
[1581.42 --> 1582.32]  through Jesus
[1582.32 --> 1582.92]  Christ.
[1583.70 --> 1584.04]  Amen.
[1585.12 --> 1585.88]  And this is
[1585.88 --> 1586.86]  the same idea
[1586.86 --> 1587.68]  that we have seen
[1587.68 --> 1588.52]  over and over
[1588.52 --> 1589.40]  and over again
[1589.40 --> 1590.28]  in the letter
[1590.28 --> 1590.84]  to the Romans
[1590.84 --> 1591.66]  that the gospel
[1591.66 --> 1593.26]  transforms us
[1593.26 --> 1593.96]  into
[1593.96 --> 1595.12]  worshipers.
[1596.92 --> 1597.96]  The gospel
[1597.96 --> 1599.20]  transforms us
[1599.20 --> 1600.08]  into worshipers
[1600.08 --> 1601.66]  and that's
[1601.66 --> 1602.72]  actually the theme
[1602.72 --> 1603.74]  for this morning.
[1604.80 --> 1604.90]  Right?
[1605.00 --> 1606.16]  God gives the gospel
[1606.16 --> 1607.30]  to start
[1607.30 --> 1608.48]  and sustain
[1608.48 --> 1609.66]  our lives
[1609.66 --> 1610.50]  of God
[1610.50 --> 1611.54]  glorifying
[1611.54 --> 1612.40]  gratitude.
[1614.24 --> 1615.10]  Now to help
[1615.10 --> 1615.82]  make this idea
[1615.82 --> 1616.90]  make sense to us
[1616.90 --> 1617.94]  coming out of this text
[1617.94 --> 1619.24]  I'll frame
[1619.24 --> 1619.86]  what's left
[1619.86 --> 1620.34]  of our time
[1620.34 --> 1620.76]  this morning
[1620.76 --> 1621.76]  around four
[1621.76 --> 1623.14]  questions.
[1624.16 --> 1624.82]  And the first
[1624.82 --> 1625.50]  question
[1625.50 --> 1627.18]  has to be
[1627.18 --> 1628.66]  what is the gospel?
[1629.76 --> 1629.90]  Right?
[1629.90 --> 1630.82]  What is the gospel?
[1631.58 --> 1632.06]  Earlier
[1632.06 --> 1633.52]  we sang a song
[1633.52 --> 1634.68]  We Are Not Ashamed
[1634.68 --> 1635.66]  and that idea
[1635.66 --> 1636.36]  comes from
[1636.36 --> 1637.04]  Romans 1
[1637.04 --> 1638.26]  verse 16
[1638.26 --> 1638.72]  it says
[1638.72 --> 1639.82]  I'm not ashamed
[1639.82 --> 1640.56]  of the gospel
[1640.56 --> 1641.80]  for it is the power
[1641.80 --> 1642.56]  of God
[1642.56 --> 1643.48]  unto salvation.
[1644.36 --> 1644.92]  The power
[1644.92 --> 1645.34]  of God
[1645.34 --> 1646.06]  unto salvation
[1646.06 --> 1647.10]  is the gospel.
[1647.22 --> 1647.62]  The gospel
[1647.62 --> 1648.40]  is the power
[1648.40 --> 1648.80]  of God
[1648.80 --> 1649.84]  unto salvation.
[1650.02 --> 1650.32]  And then in
[1650.32 --> 1651.58]  Romans 17
[1651.58 --> 1653.06]  he continues
[1653.06 --> 1654.08]  in the gospel
[1654.08 --> 1654.90]  the righteousness
[1654.90 --> 1655.58]  of God
[1655.58 --> 1656.22]  is revealed
[1656.22 --> 1657.16]  a righteousness
[1657.16 --> 1658.44]  that is by faith
[1658.44 --> 1659.16]  from first
[1659.16 --> 1660.00]  to last
[1660.00 --> 1661.92]  just as it is written
[1661.92 --> 1662.84]  the righteous
[1662.84 --> 1663.66]  will live
[1663.66 --> 1664.94]  by faith.
[1665.96 --> 1666.64]  Jesus
[1666.64 --> 1668.12]  is
[1668.12 --> 1669.00]  the righteousness
[1669.00 --> 1670.30]  of God.
[1670.80 --> 1671.58]  The truth
[1671.58 --> 1672.54]  is that in Adam
[1672.54 --> 1673.50]  all sin
[1673.50 --> 1674.56]  and death
[1674.56 --> 1675.50]  has now entered
[1675.50 --> 1676.34]  the world
[1676.34 --> 1677.16]  through sin
[1677.16 --> 1678.64]  and in Christ
[1678.64 --> 1680.04]  the gospel reality
[1680.04 --> 1681.02]  is that all
[1681.02 --> 1682.28]  are made alive
[1682.28 --> 1683.02]  that life
[1683.02 --> 1683.72]  is granted
[1683.72 --> 1684.80]  by him.
[1684.80 --> 1686.40]  This is the gospel
[1686.40 --> 1687.04]  in its most
[1687.04 --> 1687.78]  fundamental
[1687.78 --> 1689.44]  core form.
[1690.36 --> 1691.22]  The idea
[1691.22 --> 1691.68]  that I am
[1691.68 --> 1692.34]  more sinful
[1692.34 --> 1693.00]  than I would
[1693.00 --> 1694.26]  ever dare
[1694.26 --> 1694.98]  admit
[1694.98 --> 1696.72]  and yet
[1696.72 --> 1698.14]  I am more
[1698.14 --> 1698.84]  loved
[1698.84 --> 1699.34]  than I could
[1699.34 --> 1700.66]  ever imagine
[1700.66 --> 1701.62]  possible.
[1702.80 --> 1703.20]  And out
[1703.20 --> 1704.44]  of this love
[1704.44 --> 1704.86]  God
[1704.86 --> 1705.90]  came into
[1705.90 --> 1706.42]  the world
[1706.42 --> 1707.50]  in Jesus Christ
[1707.50 --> 1708.18]  and he lived
[1708.18 --> 1708.70]  the life
[1708.70 --> 1709.58]  I should have
[1709.58 --> 1709.96]  lived.
[1712.10 --> 1712.90]  In living
[1712.90 --> 1713.40]  the life
[1713.40 --> 1713.98]  I should have
[1713.98 --> 1714.58]  lived even
[1714.58 --> 1715.20]  though he
[1715.20 --> 1716.06]  was innocent
[1716.06 --> 1716.96]  and perfect
[1716.96 --> 1717.58]  even though
[1717.58 --> 1718.06]  he kept
[1718.06 --> 1718.46]  all the
[1718.46 --> 1718.98]  requirements
[1718.98 --> 1720.08]  of the law
[1720.08 --> 1721.10]  even though
[1721.10 --> 1721.52]  he was
[1721.52 --> 1721.86]  innocent
[1721.86 --> 1722.56]  this same
[1722.56 --> 1723.16]  Jesus
[1723.16 --> 1724.10]  died the
[1724.10 --> 1724.46]  death
[1724.46 --> 1725.14]  that I
[1725.14 --> 1725.66]  deserved.
[1726.84 --> 1727.38]  And that in
[1727.38 --> 1727.82]  dying the
[1727.82 --> 1728.34]  death that I
[1728.34 --> 1728.92]  deserved for
[1728.92 --> 1729.48]  sin he
[1729.48 --> 1730.06]  paid the
[1730.06 --> 1730.34]  penalty.
[1730.52 --> 1730.98]  He bore
[1730.98 --> 1731.74]  the wrath
[1731.74 --> 1732.20]  of God
[1732.20 --> 1732.62]  for sin
[1732.62 --> 1732.98]  so that
[1732.98 --> 1733.74]  I might
[1733.74 --> 1734.20]  not have
[1734.20 --> 1734.40]  to.
[1735.16 --> 1735.76]  That's the
[1735.76 --> 1736.22]  gospel.
[1737.42 --> 1738.08]  That he
[1738.08 --> 1738.52]  lived the
[1738.52 --> 1738.86]  life I
[1738.86 --> 1739.18]  should have
[1739.18 --> 1739.54]  lived and
[1739.54 --> 1739.96]  died the
[1739.96 --> 1740.32]  death that
[1740.32 --> 1740.78]  I deserved
[1740.78 --> 1741.02]  and that
[1741.02 --> 1741.64]  three days
[1741.64 --> 1742.40]  later he
[1742.40 --> 1743.02]  was raised
[1743.02 --> 1743.56]  again.
[1743.98 --> 1744.66]  victorious
[1744.66 --> 1745.50]  over sin
[1745.50 --> 1746.02]  and death
[1746.02 --> 1746.56]  and now
[1746.56 --> 1747.04]  he has
[1747.04 --> 1747.74]  called us
[1747.74 --> 1748.22]  to be
[1748.22 --> 1748.68]  his
[1748.68 --> 1749.08]  witnesses
[1749.08 --> 1749.82]  in Judea
[1749.82 --> 1750.50]  and Samaria
[1750.50 --> 1751.00]  and to the
[1751.00 --> 1751.44]  ends of the
[1751.44 --> 1751.62]  earth.
[1751.92 --> 1752.38]  He has
[1752.38 --> 1753.02]  ascended to
[1753.02 --> 1753.44]  the right
[1753.44 --> 1754.22]  hand of
[1754.22 --> 1754.60]  God the
[1754.60 --> 1754.86]  Father
[1754.86 --> 1755.26]  and from
[1755.26 --> 1755.64]  there
[1755.64 --> 1756.28]  together
[1756.28 --> 1756.66]  they have
[1756.66 --> 1757.20]  sent the
[1757.20 --> 1757.96]  Holy Spirit
[1757.96 --> 1758.54]  so that
[1758.54 --> 1759.14]  we might
[1759.14 --> 1760.04]  live this
[1760.04 --> 1761.36]  truth out
[1761.36 --> 1761.80]  in the
[1761.80 --> 1762.10]  world.
[1764.24 --> 1764.96]  That's the
[1764.96 --> 1765.44]  gospel.
[1767.18 --> 1767.96]  And here's
[1767.96 --> 1768.36]  what I want
[1768.36 --> 1768.76]  us to make
[1768.76 --> 1769.44]  sure we hear
[1769.44 --> 1769.98]  coming out
[1769.98 --> 1770.70]  of this
[1770.70 --> 1771.52]  letter to
[1771.52 --> 1771.68]  the
[1771.68 --> 1772.00]  Romans.
[1773.58 --> 1774.52]  The gospel
[1774.52 --> 1775.48]  is not
[1775.48 --> 1776.90]  that you
[1776.90 --> 1778.36]  love God
[1778.36 --> 1778.74]  and love
[1778.74 --> 1779.10]  your neighbor.
[1780.74 --> 1781.58]  The gospel
[1781.58 --> 1782.36]  is not
[1782.36 --> 1783.02]  that you
[1783.02 --> 1783.50]  try to be
[1783.50 --> 1783.86]  good to
[1783.86 --> 1784.34]  everyone.
[1785.52 --> 1786.40]  The gospel
[1786.40 --> 1787.06]  isn't that
[1787.06 --> 1787.38]  you love
[1787.38 --> 1787.96]  your enemies
[1787.96 --> 1789.28]  and the
[1789.28 --> 1789.98]  gospel isn't
[1789.98 --> 1790.30]  that you're
[1790.30 --> 1790.84]  created in
[1790.84 --> 1791.18]  the image
[1791.18 --> 1791.58]  of God
[1791.58 --> 1792.08]  and loved
[1792.08 --> 1792.94]  just how
[1792.94 --> 1793.40]  you are
[1793.40 --> 1794.30]  and remain
[1794.30 --> 1794.60]  there.
[1795.18 --> 1796.12]  Even though
[1796.12 --> 1796.80]  every one
[1796.80 --> 1797.14]  of those
[1797.14 --> 1797.60]  things is
[1797.60 --> 1798.22]  true except
[1798.22 --> 1798.56]  for the
[1798.56 --> 1798.88]  remaining
[1798.88 --> 1799.24]  there a
[1799.24 --> 1799.42]  bit.
[1801.28 --> 1802.00]  In some
[1802.00 --> 1802.50]  way every
[1802.50 --> 1802.84]  one of
[1802.84 --> 1803.36]  those things
[1803.36 --> 1803.74]  is a
[1803.74 --> 1804.56]  calling and
[1804.56 --> 1805.06]  a reality
[1805.06 --> 1805.40]  that we're
[1805.40 --> 1805.92]  supposed to
[1805.92 --> 1806.52]  live out
[1806.52 --> 1807.50]  after the
[1807.50 --> 1808.32]  gospel has
[1808.32 --> 1808.68]  been made
[1808.68 --> 1809.28]  effective in
[1809.28 --> 1809.64]  our lives.
[1809.72 --> 1810.22]  The order
[1810.22 --> 1811.08]  matters.
[1812.50 --> 1813.44]  The gospel
[1813.44 --> 1814.60]  as the
[1814.60 --> 1815.14]  gospel,
[1815.64 --> 1816.10]  the good
[1816.10 --> 1816.74]  news of
[1816.74 --> 1817.88]  Jesus Christ
[1817.88 --> 1819.32]  matters here.
[1820.02 --> 1820.32]  And too
[1820.32 --> 1821.14]  many times
[1821.14 --> 1821.72]  too many
[1821.72 --> 1822.16]  people,
[1822.32 --> 1822.68]  Christian
[1822.68 --> 1823.36]  people,
[1823.48 --> 1823.98]  well-meaning
[1823.98 --> 1824.62]  people,
[1824.84 --> 1825.72]  invert the
[1825.72 --> 1826.04]  order.
[1826.78 --> 1827.22]  Too many
[1827.22 --> 1828.26]  times people
[1828.26 --> 1829.34]  change the
[1829.34 --> 1830.14]  expectations.
[1831.40 --> 1831.78]  Too many
[1831.78 --> 1832.40]  times Christians
[1832.40 --> 1832.92]  say you
[1832.92 --> 1833.34]  need to
[1833.34 --> 1833.90]  live the
[1833.90 --> 1834.40]  way we
[1834.40 --> 1835.32]  live before
[1835.32 --> 1836.28]  you have
[1836.28 --> 1836.44]  the
[1836.44 --> 1836.96]  transformation
[1836.96 --> 1837.94]  we have.
[1840.36 --> 1841.22]  The gospel
[1841.22 --> 1842.40]  is the
[1842.40 --> 1843.14]  good news
[1843.14 --> 1843.70]  of Jesus
[1843.70 --> 1844.28]  Christ.
[1844.70 --> 1845.30]  And it's
[1845.30 --> 1846.16]  laying hold
[1846.16 --> 1846.48]  of the
[1846.48 --> 1847.22]  gospel that
[1847.22 --> 1847.82]  transforms
[1847.82 --> 1848.22]  us.
[1848.50 --> 1849.08]  By grace
[1849.08 --> 1849.70]  through faith
[1849.70 --> 1850.22]  when people
[1850.22 --> 1850.98]  believe this
[1850.98 --> 1851.38]  truth,
[1851.68 --> 1852.08]  you are
[1852.08 --> 1852.76]  transformed.
[1853.18 --> 1853.80]  The gospel
[1853.80 --> 1854.72]  transforms you
[1854.72 --> 1855.48]  because God
[1855.48 --> 1856.46]  has already
[1856.46 --> 1857.76]  regenerated your
[1857.76 --> 1858.26]  heart so
[1858.26 --> 1858.56]  that you
[1858.56 --> 1859.50]  can believe.
[1860.14 --> 1860.22]  Right?
[1860.32 --> 1861.00]  Regeneration
[1861.00 --> 1861.78]  precedes
[1861.78 --> 1862.36]  faith.
[1862.46 --> 1862.68]  We had a
[1862.68 --> 1863.14]  whole sermon
[1863.14 --> 1863.64]  on that
[1863.64 --> 1864.40]  from Romans
[1864.40 --> 1865.12]  9, 30
[1865.12 --> 1865.96]  to 10, 13.
[1867.40 --> 1867.92]  Believing
[1867.92 --> 1869.12]  this gospel
[1869.12 --> 1870.74]  unites us
[1870.74 --> 1871.78]  to Christ.
[1873.50 --> 1874.02]  And so we
[1874.02 --> 1875.30]  cannot exchange
[1875.30 --> 1876.00]  the gospel
[1876.00 --> 1877.06]  for what we've
[1877.06 --> 1877.42]  called a
[1877.42 --> 1878.22]  nova lex,
[1878.30 --> 1878.78]  a new
[1878.78 --> 1879.44]  law.
[1880.22 --> 1880.84]  And we
[1880.84 --> 1881.72]  cannot exchange
[1881.72 --> 1882.38]  the gospel
[1882.38 --> 1883.52]  for no
[1883.52 --> 1884.04]  law.
[1885.00 --> 1885.50]  We can't
[1885.50 --> 1886.12]  exchange the
[1886.12 --> 1886.76]  gospel for
[1886.76 --> 1887.26]  the messaging
[1887.26 --> 1888.00]  of the
[1888.00 --> 1888.40]  world.
[1889.38 --> 1889.92]  The gospel
[1889.92 --> 1890.72]  is a
[1890.72 --> 1891.60]  message and
[1891.60 --> 1892.20]  an eternal
[1892.20 --> 1893.00]  message that
[1893.00 --> 1893.66]  gives us an
[1893.66 --> 1894.56]  eternal hope.
[1895.22 --> 1895.68]  And we
[1895.68 --> 1896.20]  can't settle
[1896.20 --> 1896.80]  for a
[1896.80 --> 1897.40]  terrestrial
[1897.40 --> 1898.68]  hope and
[1898.68 --> 1899.08]  a lesser
[1899.08 --> 1899.82]  glory in
[1899.82 --> 1900.44]  its place.
[1901.26 --> 1901.92]  But all
[1901.92 --> 1902.58]  too often
[1902.58 --> 1903.78]  that's what
[1903.78 --> 1904.16]  we do.
[1906.02 --> 1906.74]  And so that
[1906.74 --> 1907.16]  brings us to
[1907.16 --> 1907.52]  the second
[1907.52 --> 1908.06]  question.
[1909.00 --> 1909.46]  How does
[1909.46 --> 1910.26]  God give
[1910.26 --> 1911.24]  the gospel?
[1911.24 --> 1912.20]  How does
[1912.20 --> 1912.64]  God make
[1912.64 --> 1913.34]  known this
[1913.34 --> 1913.76]  truth?
[1913.98 --> 1914.28]  How do
[1914.28 --> 1914.82]  we ensure
[1914.82 --> 1915.14]  that we're
[1915.14 --> 1915.48]  getting the
[1915.48 --> 1916.06]  real thing
[1916.06 --> 1916.36]  and not
[1916.36 --> 1917.20]  some lesser
[1917.20 --> 1918.02]  gospel,
[1918.22 --> 1919.14]  some substitute?
[1919.94 --> 1920.34]  And how do
[1920.34 --> 1921.26]  we have other
[1921.26 --> 1922.08]  people hear
[1922.08 --> 1922.78]  this truth
[1922.78 --> 1923.16]  and be
[1923.16 --> 1923.86]  convicted by
[1923.86 --> 1924.10]  it and
[1924.10 --> 1924.36]  believe?
[1925.64 --> 1926.26]  We've seen
[1926.26 --> 1926.82]  this too.
[1927.46 --> 1928.38]  Romans 10
[1928.38 --> 1929.28]  tells us
[1929.28 --> 1930.68]  very clearly,
[1930.88 --> 1931.48]  if you declare
[1931.48 --> 1932.20]  with your mouth
[1932.20 --> 1933.18]  Jesus is Lord
[1933.18 --> 1933.78]  and believe
[1933.78 --> 1934.38]  in your heart
[1934.38 --> 1934.74]  that God
[1934.74 --> 1935.24]  raised him
[1935.24 --> 1935.60]  from the
[1935.60 --> 1935.82]  dead,
[1935.92 --> 1936.40]  you will
[1936.40 --> 1937.04]  be saved.
[1938.16 --> 1938.44]  And there's
[1938.44 --> 1939.04]  another summary
[1939.04 --> 1939.66]  of the gospel.
[1939.84 --> 1940.72]  Jesus is Lord
[1940.72 --> 1941.22]  and God
[1941.22 --> 1941.80]  raised him
[1941.80 --> 1942.18]  from the
[1942.18 --> 1942.40]  dead.
[1943.28 --> 1943.90]  That's all
[1943.90 --> 1944.28]  it takes
[1944.28 --> 1944.58]  to be
[1944.58 --> 1944.86]  saved.
[1945.88 --> 1946.32]  Believing
[1946.32 --> 1946.88]  this truth
[1946.88 --> 1947.24]  is the
[1947.24 --> 1947.76]  gift of
[1947.76 --> 1948.16]  God
[1948.16 --> 1948.94]  by grace
[1948.94 --> 1949.58]  through faith.
[1950.44 --> 1950.72]  And Paul
[1950.72 --> 1951.48]  says very
[1951.48 --> 1952.46]  clearly to
[1952.46 --> 1953.12]  everyone who
[1953.12 --> 1953.90]  calls on
[1953.90 --> 1954.14]  the name
[1954.14 --> 1954.38]  of the
[1954.38 --> 1954.58]  Lord
[1954.58 --> 1955.12]  that you
[1955.12 --> 1955.80]  will be
[1955.80 --> 1956.24]  saved.
[1957.68 --> 1958.24]  But again,
[1958.96 --> 1959.52]  that begs
[1959.52 --> 1960.26]  the question,
[1960.88 --> 1961.48]  how can
[1961.48 --> 1962.14]  they call
[1962.14 --> 1962.50]  on the
[1962.50 --> 1962.76]  name of
[1962.76 --> 1963.04]  the Lord?
[1963.12 --> 1963.60]  How will
[1963.60 --> 1964.44]  they hear
[1964.44 --> 1964.80]  the name
[1964.80 --> 1965.02]  of the
[1965.02 --> 1965.36]  Lord in
[1965.36 --> 1965.68]  order to
[1965.68 --> 1966.46]  call on
[1966.46 --> 1966.66]  him?
[1967.68 --> 1967.82]  And
[1967.82 --> 1968.06]  scripture
[1968.06 --> 1968.68]  has this
[1968.68 --> 1969.30]  answer too.
[1969.30 --> 1970.62]  How then
[1970.62 --> 1970.96]  can they
[1970.96 --> 1971.40]  call on
[1971.40 --> 1971.78]  the one
[1971.78 --> 1973.12]  they have
[1973.12 --> 1973.66]  not believed
[1973.66 --> 1973.94]  in?
[1974.18 --> 1974.44]  And how
[1974.44 --> 1974.74]  can they
[1974.74 --> 1975.26]  believe in
[1975.26 --> 1975.72]  one of
[1975.72 --> 1976.10]  whom they
[1976.10 --> 1976.48]  have not
[1976.48 --> 1976.80]  heard?
[1977.04 --> 1977.40]  And how
[1977.40 --> 1977.72]  can they
[1977.72 --> 1978.72]  hear without
[1978.72 --> 1979.50]  someone preaching
[1979.50 --> 1979.94]  to them?
[1979.98 --> 1980.26]  And how
[1980.26 --> 1980.86]  can anyone
[1980.86 --> 1981.74]  preach unless
[1981.74 --> 1982.20]  they are
[1982.20 --> 1982.58]  sent?
[1983.72 --> 1984.64]  God gives
[1984.64 --> 1985.28]  the gospel
[1985.28 --> 1986.04]  by sending
[1986.04 --> 1987.28]  out preachers.
[1988.04 --> 1988.64]  And let me
[1988.64 --> 1989.08]  be really
[1989.08 --> 1989.42]  clear,
[1989.56 --> 1989.70]  okay,
[1989.74 --> 1990.22]  it is true
[1990.22 --> 1990.60]  that I
[1990.60 --> 1990.98]  have a
[1990.98 --> 1991.26]  unique
[1991.26 --> 1991.76]  calling
[1991.76 --> 1992.62]  standing on
[1992.62 --> 1993.04]  this stage
[1993.04 --> 1993.28]  as a
[1993.28 --> 1993.50]  preacher,
[1993.66 --> 1994.18]  Pastor Kevin,
[1994.52 --> 1995.06]  Pastor Josh,
[1995.14 --> 1995.58]  anyone who
[1995.58 --> 1996.02]  comes up
[1996.02 --> 1996.68]  here and
[1996.68 --> 1997.60]  is given
[1997.60 --> 1998.42]  to speak
[1998.42 --> 1998.86]  God's
[1998.86 --> 1999.24]  word to
[1999.24 --> 1999.52]  you has
[1999.52 --> 2000.00]  a unique
[2000.00 --> 2000.68]  calling in
[2000.68 --> 2001.18]  a way that
[2001.18 --> 2002.02]  is intended
[2002.02 --> 2002.52]  to build
[2002.52 --> 2002.82]  up the
[2002.82 --> 2003.28]  church and
[2003.28 --> 2003.86]  to equip
[2003.86 --> 2004.70]  you for
[2004.70 --> 2005.68]  your expression
[2005.68 --> 2006.68]  of faith,
[2006.78 --> 2007.22]  for your
[2007.22 --> 2008.72]  expression of
[2008.72 --> 2009.64]  the same
[2009.64 --> 2010.48]  calling.
[2011.42 --> 2012.30]  Because you,
[2012.68 --> 2013.46]  every one of
[2013.46 --> 2013.76]  you who
[2013.76 --> 2014.08]  believe,
[2014.20 --> 2014.64]  are called
[2014.64 --> 2015.16]  to preach
[2015.16 --> 2015.78]  the gospel.
[2016.46 --> 2017.02]  That's how
[2017.02 --> 2017.76]  people hear,
[2018.08 --> 2018.48]  that's how
[2018.48 --> 2019.18]  people know,
[2019.52 --> 2020.04]  that's how
[2020.04 --> 2020.66]  God gives
[2020.66 --> 2021.08]  us the
[2021.08 --> 2021.52]  message.
[2022.34 --> 2022.66]  Again,
[2022.76 --> 2023.08]  in Romans
[2023.08 --> 2023.40]  10,
[2023.52 --> 2023.96]  Paul says,
[2023.96 --> 2024.96]  consequently,
[2025.20 --> 2025.86]  faith comes
[2025.86 --> 2026.52]  from hearing
[2026.52 --> 2027.24]  the message
[2027.24 --> 2027.56]  and the
[2027.56 --> 2028.08]  message is
[2028.08 --> 2028.96]  heard through
[2028.96 --> 2029.58]  the word
[2029.58 --> 2030.90]  of Christ.
[2033.22 --> 2033.96]  And here,
[2034.40 --> 2035.28]  I'm going to
[2035.28 --> 2036.02]  slow down
[2036.02 --> 2037.80]  because I
[2037.80 --> 2038.28]  want to be
[2038.28 --> 2039.74]  really clear
[2039.74 --> 2040.90]  about the
[2040.90 --> 2041.32]  next thing
[2041.32 --> 2041.76]  I say.
[2042.98 --> 2043.56]  Because
[2043.56 --> 2044.30]  sometimes,
[2045.06 --> 2045.88]  well-meaning
[2045.88 --> 2047.00]  people hear
[2047.00 --> 2048.22]  this message,
[2048.34 --> 2048.84]  hear this
[2048.84 --> 2049.50]  truth,
[2049.80 --> 2050.78]  and immediately
[2050.78 --> 2052.72]  our brains
[2052.72 --> 2053.26]  have been
[2053.26 --> 2053.78]  conditioned
[2053.78 --> 2054.78]  to hear
[2054.78 --> 2055.34]  the words
[2055.34 --> 2055.94]  of Francis
[2055.94 --> 2056.44]  Assisi,
[2057.36 --> 2057.96]  who said,
[2058.40 --> 2058.92]  always preach
[2058.92 --> 2059.52]  the gospel,
[2060.12 --> 2061.50]  if necessary,
[2062.20 --> 2062.92]  use words.
[2064.36 --> 2065.38]  The idea
[2065.38 --> 2066.10]  there being
[2066.10 --> 2067.04]  that if you
[2067.04 --> 2067.96]  live the
[2067.96 --> 2068.88]  kind of life
[2068.88 --> 2069.62]  that the
[2069.62 --> 2070.40]  gospel talks
[2070.40 --> 2070.84]  about,
[2071.18 --> 2072.62]  and people
[2072.62 --> 2073.32]  see that,
[2073.94 --> 2075.26]  then they
[2075.26 --> 2075.78]  will see
[2075.78 --> 2076.50]  that life
[2076.50 --> 2077.38]  and want
[2077.38 --> 2078.02]  that life,
[2078.06 --> 2078.68]  and you
[2078.68 --> 2079.46]  don't actually
[2079.46 --> 2080.08]  have to say
[2080.08 --> 2080.46]  anything.
[2080.74 --> 2081.30]  You don't
[2081.30 --> 2081.86]  actually have
[2081.86 --> 2082.72]  to use words.
[2082.72 --> 2084.28]  but hear
[2084.28 --> 2084.54]  this,
[2084.60 --> 2084.84]  this is
[2084.84 --> 2085.14]  really
[2085.14 --> 2085.74]  important,
[2086.14 --> 2086.24]  right?
[2086.74 --> 2087.34]  Salvation
[2087.34 --> 2088.20]  doesn't come
[2088.20 --> 2089.18]  to anyone
[2089.18 --> 2091.14]  by following
[2091.14 --> 2092.38]  someone's
[2092.38 --> 2093.04]  example.
[2096.12 --> 2096.68]  Now,
[2096.72 --> 2096.94]  don't hear
[2096.94 --> 2097.16]  what I'm
[2097.16 --> 2097.66]  not saying.
[2098.40 --> 2098.90]  Set a
[2098.90 --> 2099.54]  good example.
[2101.06 --> 2101.88]  But it is
[2101.88 --> 2102.78]  not by your
[2102.78 --> 2104.06]  example that
[2104.06 --> 2104.52]  people are
[2104.52 --> 2104.82]  saved.
[2104.98 --> 2105.48]  It's not
[2105.48 --> 2106.04]  even by
[2106.04 --> 2106.86]  following the
[2106.86 --> 2107.64]  example of
[2107.64 --> 2108.66]  Jesus that
[2108.66 --> 2109.16]  people are
[2109.16 --> 2109.54]  saved.
[2109.54 --> 2109.60]  saved.
[2110.48 --> 2111.30]  Because in
[2111.30 --> 2112.02]  following the
[2112.02 --> 2112.52]  example,
[2112.84 --> 2113.28]  what do we
[2113.28 --> 2113.58]  do?
[2114.66 --> 2115.30]  At least
[2115.30 --> 2115.70]  what do I
[2115.70 --> 2115.96]  do?
[2116.74 --> 2117.66]  I fail
[2117.66 --> 2118.84]  all the
[2118.84 --> 2119.22]  time.
[2120.06 --> 2120.74]  I can't
[2120.74 --> 2121.24]  do it.
[2121.70 --> 2122.40]  I can't
[2122.40 --> 2122.92]  keep it
[2122.92 --> 2123.66]  perfectly.
[2124.72 --> 2125.00]  And so
[2125.00 --> 2125.44]  it's true
[2125.44 --> 2125.86]  for people
[2125.86 --> 2126.38]  who follow
[2126.38 --> 2127.30]  me as
[2127.30 --> 2127.90]  an example.
[2128.06 --> 2128.40]  You're not
[2128.40 --> 2128.60]  going to
[2128.60 --> 2128.86]  do it
[2128.86 --> 2129.30]  because I
[2129.30 --> 2129.60]  can't
[2129.60 --> 2129.96]  do it.
[2130.68 --> 2131.34]  People are
[2131.34 --> 2132.04]  saved not
[2132.04 --> 2132.78]  by following
[2132.78 --> 2133.92]  the example
[2133.92 --> 2135.38]  but by
[2135.38 --> 2136.82]  believing the
[2136.82 --> 2137.34]  message.
[2137.34 --> 2137.42]  message.
[2139.00 --> 2139.26]  And so
[2139.26 --> 2139.84]  again, let
[2139.84 --> 2140.36]  me be really
[2140.36 --> 2140.62]  clear.
[2140.94 --> 2141.78]  The life
[2141.78 --> 2142.70]  you live
[2142.70 --> 2144.46]  confirms that
[2144.46 --> 2144.96]  you believe
[2144.96 --> 2145.70]  this message.
[2146.28 --> 2146.92]  The life
[2146.92 --> 2147.66]  you live
[2147.66 --> 2149.36]  helps validate
[2149.36 --> 2150.50]  the truth of
[2150.50 --> 2151.04]  the gospel
[2151.04 --> 2151.50]  that you
[2151.50 --> 2152.08]  declare.
[2153.16 --> 2153.76]  But for
[2153.76 --> 2154.54]  people to
[2154.54 --> 2155.84]  receive salvation
[2155.84 --> 2156.56]  and to be
[2156.56 --> 2157.24]  saved by
[2157.24 --> 2157.88]  their believing,
[2158.02 --> 2158.46]  they have to
[2158.46 --> 2159.36]  hear the
[2159.36 --> 2160.02]  message of
[2160.02 --> 2161.42]  Jesus and
[2161.42 --> 2162.26]  confess that
[2162.26 --> 2162.94]  Jesus is
[2162.94 --> 2163.66]  Lord and
[2163.66 --> 2164.24]  believe that
[2164.24 --> 2164.72]  God raised
[2164.72 --> 2165.04]  him from
[2165.04 --> 2165.42]  the dead.
[2165.42 --> 2171.08]  the life
[2171.08 --> 2171.50]  you live
[2171.50 --> 2172.54]  confirms the
[2172.54 --> 2173.02]  truth of
[2173.02 --> 2173.58]  the gospel
[2173.58 --> 2175.36]  but it
[2175.36 --> 2175.66]  doesn't
[2175.66 --> 2176.18]  preach it.
[2177.40 --> 2178.22]  To preach
[2178.22 --> 2178.92]  it, you've
[2178.92 --> 2179.38]  got to use
[2179.38 --> 2179.78]  words.
[2180.50 --> 2181.08]  You've got to
[2181.08 --> 2181.40]  use the
[2181.40 --> 2181.68]  scriptures.
[2181.86 --> 2182.16]  You've got to
[2182.16 --> 2182.70]  rely on the
[2182.70 --> 2183.16]  Holy Spirit
[2183.16 --> 2183.96]  to transform
[2183.96 --> 2184.66]  lives by
[2184.66 --> 2184.86]  it.
[2185.40 --> 2186.02]  But here's
[2186.02 --> 2186.50]  the promise
[2186.50 --> 2186.92]  that comes
[2186.92 --> 2187.18]  with the
[2187.18 --> 2187.48]  gospel,
[2187.76 --> 2188.02]  that he
[2188.02 --> 2188.40]  will do
[2188.40 --> 2188.64]  it,
[2189.08 --> 2189.36]  that he
[2189.36 --> 2189.96]  will use
[2189.96 --> 2190.56]  you and
[2190.56 --> 2190.82]  me.
[2191.12 --> 2191.44]  The good
[2191.44 --> 2192.06]  news of
[2192.06 --> 2192.86]  our call
[2192.86 --> 2193.34]  to mission
[2193.34 --> 2193.94]  together is
[2193.94 --> 2194.32]  that God
[2194.32 --> 2195.26]  promises to
[2195.26 --> 2196.02]  use broken
[2196.02 --> 2197.22]  vessels like
[2197.22 --> 2198.22]  us to
[2198.22 --> 2199.00]  accomplish his
[2199.00 --> 2199.46]  purposes.
[2200.44 --> 2200.90]  God says
[2200.90 --> 2201.24]  that when he
[2201.24 --> 2201.82]  sends out
[2201.82 --> 2202.32]  his word,
[2202.48 --> 2203.18]  it will not
[2203.18 --> 2203.78]  return to
[2203.78 --> 2204.60]  him except
[2204.60 --> 2205.54]  for accomplishing
[2205.54 --> 2206.16]  the purposes
[2206.16 --> 2206.74]  that he has
[2206.74 --> 2207.08]  sent it.
[2207.26 --> 2208.00]  He promises
[2208.00 --> 2209.04]  to use our
[2209.04 --> 2209.54]  feeble
[2209.54 --> 2210.18]  attempts.
[2210.30 --> 2210.78]  He promises
[2210.78 --> 2211.58]  to use our
[2211.58 --> 2212.14]  stumbling
[2212.14 --> 2212.86]  words.
[2213.00 --> 2213.50]  He promises
[2213.50 --> 2215.10]  to use our
[2215.10 --> 2216.94]  boring examples
[2216.94 --> 2218.18]  and our bad
[2218.18 --> 2220.14]  sermons because
[2220.14 --> 2220.74]  he is a good
[2220.74 --> 2222.34]  God who can
[2222.34 --> 2222.82]  do that.
[2222.82 --> 2224.88]  God gives
[2224.88 --> 2225.64]  the seed of
[2225.64 --> 2226.22]  the gospel.
[2226.50 --> 2226.96]  He gives
[2226.96 --> 2227.22]  it the
[2227.22 --> 2227.54]  growth.
[2227.86 --> 2228.56]  He causes
[2228.56 --> 2228.96]  it to
[2228.96 --> 2229.52]  take root.
[2231.12 --> 2231.68]  So God
[2231.68 --> 2232.18]  gives the
[2232.18 --> 2232.92]  gospel through
[2232.92 --> 2233.56]  his word
[2233.56 --> 2234.90]  proclaimed by
[2234.90 --> 2235.30]  you and
[2235.30 --> 2235.54]  me.
[2236.30 --> 2236.92]  God gives
[2236.92 --> 2237.68]  the message
[2237.68 --> 2238.72]  when we are
[2238.72 --> 2239.40]  not ashamed
[2239.40 --> 2239.86]  and we
[2239.86 --> 2240.46]  declare it
[2240.46 --> 2240.74]  to the
[2240.74 --> 2241.12]  nations.
[2242.44 --> 2243.28]  You are
[2243.28 --> 2244.02]  his witnesses
[2244.02 --> 2245.22]  through Judea
[2245.22 --> 2245.88]  and Samaria
[2245.88 --> 2246.54]  and to all
[2246.54 --> 2247.16]  the nations
[2247.16 --> 2247.76]  of the world.
[2248.08 --> 2248.94]  You proclaim
[2248.94 --> 2249.58]  his kingdom
[2249.58 --> 2250.30]  come and his
[2250.30 --> 2250.90]  kingdom coming.
[2250.90 --> 2252.32]  You are the
[2252.32 --> 2253.70]  ambassadors of
[2253.70 --> 2254.26]  the gospel.
[2255.88 --> 2256.70]  And when we
[2256.70 --> 2257.94]  go out with
[2257.94 --> 2258.86]  this message
[2258.86 --> 2260.24]  lives are
[2260.24 --> 2260.72]  changed.
[2262.08 --> 2262.86]  The world
[2262.86 --> 2263.66]  is transformed
[2263.66 --> 2265.28]  because that's
[2265.28 --> 2265.78]  how God has
[2265.78 --> 2266.40]  set it up
[2266.40 --> 2267.74]  in that order.
[2268.78 --> 2269.28]  That's our
[2269.28 --> 2270.40]  third question,
[2270.48 --> 2271.18]  our third point
[2271.18 --> 2271.74]  this morning.
[2272.14 --> 2273.12]  How then does
[2273.12 --> 2273.78]  the gospel
[2273.78 --> 2275.32]  from start to
[2275.32 --> 2276.80]  finish sustain
[2276.80 --> 2277.86]  our lives?
[2278.68 --> 2279.40]  Believing in the
[2279.40 --> 2280.12]  gospel is how we
[2280.12 --> 2280.82]  are born again.
[2281.34 --> 2281.84]  Believing in the
[2281.84 --> 2282.44]  gospel is how
[2282.44 --> 2283.20]  Christian life
[2283.20 --> 2283.76]  starts.
[2284.28 --> 2285.14]  But believing
[2285.14 --> 2285.96]  and applying
[2285.96 --> 2286.82]  the gospel is
[2286.82 --> 2288.32]  also how our
[2288.32 --> 2289.08]  Christian life
[2289.08 --> 2289.92]  is sustained.
[2290.98 --> 2291.74]  Paul writes
[2291.74 --> 2292.36]  in our text,
[2292.52 --> 2293.20]  now to him
[2293.20 --> 2293.92]  who is able
[2293.92 --> 2294.72]  to establish
[2294.72 --> 2295.70]  you in
[2295.70 --> 2296.44]  accordance with
[2296.44 --> 2297.08]  my gospel.
[2297.92 --> 2298.50]  Sometimes I
[2298.50 --> 2298.94]  think when we
[2298.94 --> 2299.44]  hear the word
[2299.44 --> 2299.94]  establish,
[2300.50 --> 2300.92]  we think of
[2300.92 --> 2301.38]  the beginning.
[2302.12 --> 2302.48]  We think of
[2302.48 --> 2303.04]  the start,
[2303.46 --> 2304.12]  the new thing
[2304.12 --> 2304.66]  that is done.
[2304.78 --> 2305.24]  God is able
[2305.24 --> 2305.86]  to establish
[2305.86 --> 2307.14]  you by faith
[2307.14 --> 2307.80]  in the gospel.
[2308.42 --> 2309.28]  But the word
[2309.28 --> 2309.96]  here that's
[2309.96 --> 2311.14]  translated establish
[2311.14 --> 2312.30]  also means
[2312.30 --> 2312.94]  strengthen.
[2313.98 --> 2314.54]  In fact,
[2314.62 --> 2315.36]  if you read
[2315.36 --> 2315.76]  a different
[2315.76 --> 2316.44]  translation of
[2316.44 --> 2316.82]  the Bible,
[2316.98 --> 2317.64]  you might see
[2317.64 --> 2318.50]  something like
[2318.50 --> 2319.72]  who is able
[2319.72 --> 2320.40]  to make you
[2320.40 --> 2321.08]  strong or
[2321.08 --> 2321.64]  who is able
[2321.64 --> 2322.24]  to strengthen
[2322.24 --> 2322.60]  you.
[2323.40 --> 2323.96]  The gospel
[2323.96 --> 2324.58]  isn't just
[2324.58 --> 2325.46]  the way into
[2325.46 --> 2326.32]  Christian faith,
[2326.46 --> 2327.36]  it is the way
[2327.36 --> 2328.18]  of Christian
[2328.18 --> 2328.58]  faith.
[2329.80 --> 2330.40]  Our faith
[2330.40 --> 2331.00]  is started
[2331.00 --> 2331.70]  by believing
[2331.70 --> 2332.28]  in the gospel
[2332.28 --> 2332.98]  and we are
[2332.98 --> 2333.58]  transformed
[2333.58 --> 2334.70]  by believing
[2334.70 --> 2335.32]  the gospel.
[2336.12 --> 2336.88]  To put this
[2336.88 --> 2337.42]  in theological
[2337.42 --> 2337.94]  terms that
[2337.94 --> 2338.26]  we've used
[2338.26 --> 2338.58]  before,
[2338.70 --> 2339.52]  we are justified
[2339.52 --> 2340.96]  when we believe
[2340.96 --> 2341.50]  the gospel
[2341.50 --> 2342.52]  and we are
[2342.52 --> 2343.78]  sanctified in
[2343.78 --> 2344.56]  our believing
[2344.56 --> 2345.50]  of the gospel.
[2346.52 --> 2347.32]  This is actually
[2347.32 --> 2348.12]  the point we saw
[2348.12 --> 2349.00]  in Romans 6
[2349.00 --> 2350.66]  verse 5 to 7.
[2350.74 --> 2351.18]  It's a little bit
[2351.18 --> 2352.18]  longer but it's
[2352.18 --> 2353.00]  worth reading again.
[2354.60 --> 2355.76]  For if we have
[2355.76 --> 2356.82]  been united with
[2356.82 --> 2357.66]  him in a death
[2357.66 --> 2358.40]  like his,
[2358.78 --> 2359.54]  we will certainly
[2359.54 --> 2360.98]  also be united
[2360.98 --> 2361.64]  with him in a
[2361.64 --> 2362.84]  resurrection like
[2362.84 --> 2363.18]  his.
[2363.18 --> 2364.54]  For we know
[2364.54 --> 2365.26]  that our old
[2365.26 --> 2366.24]  self was crucified
[2366.24 --> 2367.12]  with him so
[2367.12 --> 2367.68]  that the body
[2367.68 --> 2368.54]  ruled by sin
[2368.54 --> 2369.00]  might be done
[2369.00 --> 2369.48]  away with,
[2369.68 --> 2370.18]  that we should
[2370.18 --> 2370.96]  no longer be
[2370.96 --> 2371.96]  slaves to sin
[2371.96 --> 2373.16]  because anyone
[2373.16 --> 2373.98]  who has died
[2373.98 --> 2374.68]  has been set
[2374.68 --> 2375.56]  free from sin.
[2375.98 --> 2376.86]  Now if we died
[2376.86 --> 2377.44]  with Christ,
[2377.54 --> 2378.22]  we believe that
[2378.22 --> 2378.70]  we will also
[2378.70 --> 2379.80]  live with him
[2379.80 --> 2381.34]  for we know
[2381.34 --> 2382.26]  that since Christ
[2382.26 --> 2382.86]  was raised
[2382.86 --> 2383.42]  from the dead,
[2383.52 --> 2384.38]  he cannot die
[2384.38 --> 2384.80]  again.
[2385.28 --> 2386.22]  Death no longer
[2386.22 --> 2387.02]  has mastery
[2387.02 --> 2387.72]  over him.
[2388.06 --> 2389.06]  The death he died,
[2389.16 --> 2390.10]  he died to sin
[2390.10 --> 2390.96]  once for all,
[2391.02 --> 2392.38]  but the life he lives,
[2392.38 --> 2395.06]  he lives for God.
[2395.62 --> 2396.84]  The life he lives,
[2396.92 --> 2398.06]  he lives for God
[2398.06 --> 2399.54]  because of the gospel.
[2400.90 --> 2401.96]  And I can't overstate
[2401.96 --> 2402.50]  this truth.
[2402.88 --> 2403.78]  It is applying
[2403.78 --> 2405.06]  the gospel to
[2405.06 --> 2406.32]  every aspect
[2406.32 --> 2407.54]  of our lives
[2407.54 --> 2408.52]  that transforms
[2408.52 --> 2409.84]  every aspect
[2409.84 --> 2410.88]  of our lives.
[2412.12 --> 2412.64]  And so how do we
[2412.64 --> 2413.68]  have victory over sin
[2413.68 --> 2414.26]  in our lives?
[2414.34 --> 2415.04]  How do we overcome
[2415.04 --> 2416.74]  addictions and pain
[2416.74 --> 2417.76]  and our brokenness?
[2417.96 --> 2418.86]  It's through the gospel.
[2418.86 --> 2420.60]  It's through our being
[2420.60 --> 2421.84]  united to Christ.
[2422.10 --> 2423.24]  It's by the application
[2423.24 --> 2424.00]  of the gospel
[2424.00 --> 2425.16]  in every corner
[2425.16 --> 2426.02]  of our hearts
[2426.02 --> 2426.86]  and in every corner
[2426.86 --> 2427.66]  of our being
[2427.66 --> 2428.92]  that our union
[2428.92 --> 2429.58]  with Christ
[2429.58 --> 2430.44]  is made more
[2430.44 --> 2431.54]  and more effective
[2431.54 --> 2432.60]  in the lives
[2432.60 --> 2433.12]  that we live.
[2439.12 --> 2440.24]  My heart,
[2440.62 --> 2442.86]  my heart is burdened
[2443.50 --> 2445.20]  for this truth
[2445.20 --> 2446.72]  in the church today.
[2446.72 --> 2450.04]  And I'm afraid
[2450.04 --> 2450.74]  that what you're
[2450.74 --> 2451.66]  hearing me say
[2451.66 --> 2454.44]  is that you need
[2454.44 --> 2455.12]  to have a personal
[2455.12 --> 2455.70]  relationship
[2455.70 --> 2456.56]  with Jesus Christ.
[2458.94 --> 2459.96]  That somehow
[2459.96 --> 2460.80]  what we're talking
[2460.80 --> 2461.48]  about here
[2461.48 --> 2462.42]  is that you need
[2462.42 --> 2463.74]  to have this emotive,
[2463.92 --> 2465.58]  experiential expression
[2465.58 --> 2466.90]  of this personal
[2466.90 --> 2467.86]  relationship
[2467.86 --> 2468.84]  with Jesus Christ.
[2469.14 --> 2469.30]  Now,
[2470.68 --> 2471.30]  I want you
[2471.30 --> 2472.02]  to have that.
[2473.14 --> 2474.12]  But when I'm talking
[2474.12 --> 2474.84]  about union
[2474.84 --> 2475.70]  with Christ,
[2475.70 --> 2476.56]  I'm talking
[2476.56 --> 2477.48]  one step
[2477.48 --> 2478.56]  before that even.
[2479.60 --> 2479.72]  Right?
[2479.76 --> 2481.12]  If the experiential
[2481.12 --> 2482.62]  emotional reality
[2482.62 --> 2484.26]  is what is expressed,
[2484.48 --> 2485.22]  I want to talk
[2485.22 --> 2486.52]  about the spiritual
[2486.52 --> 2487.80]  internal reality,
[2487.96 --> 2489.90]  the new ontological truth
[2489.90 --> 2491.24]  that you have been
[2491.24 --> 2492.34]  united with Jesus
[2492.34 --> 2493.70]  and that redefines
[2493.70 --> 2494.54]  reality.
[2494.80 --> 2495.56]  It's less about
[2495.56 --> 2496.60]  your expression
[2496.60 --> 2497.80]  and your feeling
[2497.80 --> 2498.72]  and more about
[2498.72 --> 2500.18]  His reality
[2500.18 --> 2501.52]  of being connected
[2501.52 --> 2502.04]  to you.
[2502.04 --> 2506.10]  My heart is burdened
[2506.10 --> 2507.58]  for us as a church
[2507.58 --> 2508.62]  and for all the church
[2508.62 --> 2509.10]  to know
[2509.10 --> 2510.58]  that the reality
[2510.58 --> 2512.10]  of being a Christian
[2512.10 --> 2513.76]  means you are united
[2513.76 --> 2514.50]  with Jesus,
[2514.66 --> 2515.82]  that you and He
[2515.82 --> 2516.66]  are one.
[2518.56 --> 2519.98]  And that changes
[2519.98 --> 2522.34]  everything about you.
[2522.84 --> 2524.32]  That changes everything
[2524.32 --> 2526.06]  possible for you.
[2527.06 --> 2528.70]  Broken are made whole,
[2528.90 --> 2530.24]  not because we feel it,
[2530.24 --> 2531.14]  but because Jesus
[2531.14 --> 2531.84]  has done it.
[2533.60 --> 2533.82]  Right?
[2533.88 --> 2534.40]  The hurting
[2534.40 --> 2535.22]  are helped,
[2535.40 --> 2536.76]  not because our problems
[2536.76 --> 2537.38]  are solved,
[2537.56 --> 2538.50]  but because Jesus
[2538.50 --> 2539.44]  is in us
[2539.44 --> 2540.16]  and with us
[2540.16 --> 2541.70]  and working through us.
[2541.70 --> 2545.30]  this is the reality
[2545.30 --> 2546.74]  that we declare
[2546.74 --> 2547.64]  as Christians
[2547.64 --> 2549.14]  proclaiming the gospel
[2549.14 --> 2550.46]  that if you confess
[2550.46 --> 2551.22]  with your mouth
[2551.22 --> 2552.44]  and believe in your heart
[2552.44 --> 2553.94]  that God raised Him
[2553.94 --> 2554.48]  from the dead,
[2554.78 --> 2555.92]  you, by grace
[2555.92 --> 2556.48]  through faith,
[2556.62 --> 2558.64]  are united to Him.
[2559.02 --> 2561.04]  And that changes
[2561.04 --> 2561.70]  everything.
[2566.70 --> 2567.58]  Which brings us
[2567.58 --> 2568.16]  to the last
[2568.16 --> 2569.34]  and final question.
[2569.34 --> 2571.82]  God gives the gospel
[2571.82 --> 2573.08]  to start and sustain
[2573.08 --> 2573.92]  our lives
[2573.92 --> 2576.92]  of God-glorifying gratitude.
[2578.60 --> 2580.52]  Why God-glorifying gratitude?
[2582.24 --> 2583.14]  Well, in a word,
[2584.02 --> 2585.06]  how could we not?
[2586.06 --> 2587.28]  How could we not
[2587.28 --> 2588.10]  if we're united
[2588.10 --> 2589.62]  with this Jesus Christ?
[2589.70 --> 2590.42]  How could we not
[2590.42 --> 2591.40]  if we've been saved
[2591.40 --> 2592.40]  from the wrath of God
[2592.40 --> 2593.26]  and the depths of hell
[2593.26 --> 2594.04]  for our sin?
[2594.16 --> 2595.18]  How could we not
[2595.18 --> 2596.92]  but give praise to Him?
[2596.92 --> 2599.52]  How could we not
[2599.52 --> 2602.32]  worship this good God?
[2603.04 --> 2604.16]  And that's what Paul does.
[2604.62 --> 2604.88]  He says,
[2605.12 --> 2605.54]  Now to Him
[2605.54 --> 2607.00]  who is able to establish you
[2607.00 --> 2608.62]  to the only wise God
[2608.62 --> 2610.24]  be glory forever
[2610.24 --> 2612.70]  through Jesus Christ.
[2613.88 --> 2615.42]  In this journey of Romans,
[2615.54 --> 2616.20]  we have seen
[2616.20 --> 2617.52]  the depth of our guilt.
[2617.66 --> 2618.28]  We have seen
[2618.28 --> 2619.12]  the magnitude
[2619.12 --> 2620.58]  of God's grace.
[2620.84 --> 2622.20]  And now we live
[2622.20 --> 2623.56]  in gratitude.
[2623.56 --> 2625.82]  In this journey
[2625.82 --> 2626.48]  through Romans,
[2626.60 --> 2627.50]  we have moved
[2627.50 --> 2629.88]  from our worry in life
[2629.88 --> 2631.38]  to worshiping
[2631.38 --> 2632.76]  through our worry.
[2632.88 --> 2633.70]  In this journey
[2633.70 --> 2634.26]  through Romans,
[2634.38 --> 2635.24]  we have seen
[2635.24 --> 2636.18]  how our work
[2636.18 --> 2637.30]  and our worship
[2637.30 --> 2639.20]  are connected together.
[2640.00 --> 2641.06]  In this journey
[2641.06 --> 2641.88]  through Romans,
[2642.06 --> 2643.34]  we have seen
[2643.34 --> 2645.04]  just how good
[2645.04 --> 2646.04]  and great
[2646.04 --> 2647.44]  our God is
[2647.44 --> 2648.56]  because we have heard
[2648.56 --> 2649.86]  over and over
[2649.86 --> 2650.90]  and over again
[2650.90 --> 2651.76]  from the first
[2651.76 --> 2652.66]  to the last
[2652.66 --> 2654.76]  just how good
[2654.76 --> 2656.14]  the good news
[2656.14 --> 2657.18]  of the gospel
[2657.18 --> 2658.80]  really is.
[2658.96 --> 2659.66]  And so how
[2659.66 --> 2660.94]  could we not
[2660.94 --> 2663.56]  worship our God?
[2666.36 --> 2668.62]  God has given us
[2668.62 --> 2669.10]  Himself
[2669.10 --> 2670.60]  in the gospel.
[2670.84 --> 2671.92]  God has united us
[2671.92 --> 2672.94]  to Jesus Christ
[2672.94 --> 2674.30]  in the gospel.
[2674.76 --> 2676.34]  God has taken us
[2676.34 --> 2677.14]  from death
[2677.14 --> 2678.38]  into life
[2678.38 --> 2679.86]  by the gospel.
[2679.86 --> 2683.80]  God gives the gospel
[2683.80 --> 2685.14]  to start
[2685.14 --> 2686.68]  and to strengthen,
[2686.94 --> 2687.68]  to sustain
[2687.68 --> 2688.90]  our lives
[2688.90 --> 2690.56]  of God-glorifying
[2690.56 --> 2691.28]  gratitude.
[2692.76 --> 2693.62]  That's why
[2693.62 --> 2694.50]  we gather here.
[2695.58 --> 2696.30]  And that's why
[2696.30 --> 2697.28]  you go from here
[2697.28 --> 2697.72]  today
[2697.72 --> 2698.60]  to proclaim
[2698.60 --> 2701.22]  this same truth.
[2702.08 --> 2703.96]  Go with this message
[2703.96 --> 2704.90]  of grace.
[2705.06 --> 2705.78]  Go with this
[2705.78 --> 2707.38]  beautiful gospel.
[2707.38 --> 2708.86]  Go as a people
[2708.86 --> 2709.92]  who can't help
[2709.92 --> 2711.28]  but praise
[2711.28 --> 2712.24]  our God
[2712.24 --> 2713.14]  and proclaim
[2713.14 --> 2714.88]  His goodness
[2714.88 --> 2716.00]  to the world.
[2716.16 --> 2716.96]  Go because
[2716.96 --> 2718.28]  this is who
[2718.28 --> 2719.14]  He has
[2719.14 --> 2720.48]  made you
[2720.48 --> 2721.70]  to be.
[2722.26 --> 2722.66]  Amen.
[2723.44 --> 2724.68]  Let's pray together.
[2729.42 --> 2730.22]  Lord,
[2730.38 --> 2731.94]  our God,
[2731.94 --> 2735.28]  we ask here
[2735.28 --> 2736.08]  that you would
[2736.08 --> 2737.22]  continue
[2737.22 --> 2738.56]  to establish
[2738.56 --> 2739.32]  us
[2739.32 --> 2740.18]  in accordance
[2740.18 --> 2741.70]  with your gospel.
[2742.72 --> 2743.28]  Continue
[2743.28 --> 2744.40]  to reveal
[2744.40 --> 2745.00]  to us
[2745.00 --> 2745.56]  the truth
[2745.56 --> 2747.10]  of Jesus Christ,
[2747.26 --> 2747.82]  the revelation
[2747.82 --> 2748.42]  of the mystery
[2748.42 --> 2749.02]  that was hidden
[2749.02 --> 2749.72]  for so long
[2749.72 --> 2750.24]  but has now
[2750.24 --> 2750.76]  been revealed
[2750.76 --> 2751.24]  to us
[2751.24 --> 2752.20]  through the scriptures
[2752.20 --> 2752.92]  and through
[2752.92 --> 2753.76]  His life,
[2753.88 --> 2754.12]  death,
[2754.30 --> 2754.74]  resurrection,
[2755.22 --> 2755.74]  through the working
[2755.74 --> 2756.32]  and the power
[2756.32 --> 2757.24]  of the Holy Spirit
[2757.24 --> 2758.16]  so that we
[2758.16 --> 2758.90]  all here
[2758.90 --> 2759.82]  might come
[2759.82 --> 2760.70]  to believe
[2760.70 --> 2762.10]  and to the obedience
[2762.10 --> 2763.14]  that comes
[2763.14 --> 2764.30]  from faith.
[2766.78 --> 2767.84]  And may we
[2767.84 --> 2769.02]  go from this
[2769.02 --> 2769.52]  place
[2769.52 --> 2770.86]  to the table
[2770.86 --> 2771.84]  and then out
[2771.84 --> 2772.82]  to the world
[2772.82 --> 2774.72]  to give You
[2774.72 --> 2776.16]  glory forever
[2776.16 --> 2778.08]  through Jesus Christ
[2778.08 --> 2778.74]  our Lord.
[2779.74 --> 2780.40]  In Your name
[2780.40 --> 2780.90]  we pray.
[2781.84 --> 2782.20]  Amen.
[2782.20 --> 2782.38]  Amen.
[2783.96 --> 2784.64]  Amen.
[2784.64 --> 2784.70]  Amen.
[2784.70 --> 2794.40]  One of the things
[2794.40 --> 2795.06]  that our Lord
[2795.06 --> 2796.14]  Jesus has done
[2796.14 --> 2797.96]  is given us
[2797.96 --> 2798.60]  a meal
[2798.60 --> 2800.04]  by which
[2800.04 --> 2800.94]  we recognize
[2800.94 --> 2801.46]  Him,
[2802.14 --> 2802.78]  by which
[2802.78 --> 2803.24]  we take
[2803.24 --> 2803.74]  the truth
[2803.74 --> 2804.66]  of the words
[2804.66 --> 2805.66]  of His revelation
[2805.66 --> 2806.90]  and we hold
[2806.90 --> 2807.64]  them in our hands
[2807.64 --> 2808.10]  that we might
[2808.10 --> 2809.14]  taste and see
[2809.14 --> 2810.12]  that the Lord
[2810.12 --> 2810.56]  is good.
[2811.72 --> 2812.34]  The truth
[2812.34 --> 2813.04]  of the gospel
[2813.04 --> 2813.76]  is proclaimed
[2813.76 --> 2814.32]  in word
[2814.32 --> 2814.98]  and it is
[2814.98 --> 2815.40]  proclaimed
[2815.40 --> 2816.68]  here at the
[2816.68 --> 2817.00]  table.
[2817.82 --> 2818.22]  So we're going
[2818.22 --> 2818.84]  to come to the
[2818.84 --> 2819.54]  table together.
[2819.68 --> 2820.08]  We have some
[2820.08 --> 2821.18]  liturgy that will
[2821.18 --> 2822.16]  usher us into
[2822.16 --> 2822.88]  the presence of
[2822.88 --> 2823.66]  God here to
[2823.66 --> 2824.64]  receive from Him
[2824.64 --> 2825.46]  His grace
[2825.46 --> 2826.10]  confirmed.
[2827.60 --> 2828.06]  And we will
[2828.06 --> 2828.46]  gather
[2828.46 --> 2830.08]  as a body of
[2830.08 --> 2831.04]  those who believe
[2831.04 --> 2832.78]  and who profess
[2832.78 --> 2834.34]  this truth.
[2835.16 --> 2835.88]  And so lift
[2835.88 --> 2837.06]  up your hearts.
[2837.06 --> 2840.72]  let us give
[2840.72 --> 2841.50]  thanks to the
[2841.50 --> 2842.44]  Lord our God.
[2845.38 --> 2846.10]  Let's pray
[2846.10 --> 2846.44]  together.
[2847.90 --> 2848.80]  With joy
[2848.80 --> 2849.50]  we praise
[2849.50 --> 2850.24]  you gracious
[2850.24 --> 2851.34]  God for you
[2851.34 --> 2852.06]  have created
[2852.06 --> 2853.12]  heaven and
[2853.12 --> 2853.54]  earth.
[2854.26 --> 2854.64]  You've made
[2854.64 --> 2855.22]  us in your
[2855.22 --> 2855.90]  image and you
[2855.90 --> 2856.32]  have kept
[2856.32 --> 2857.12]  covenant with
[2857.12 --> 2858.36]  us even when
[2858.36 --> 2859.04]  we fell into
[2859.04 --> 2859.34]  sin.
[2860.26 --> 2861.06]  We give you
[2861.06 --> 2861.74]  thanks for
[2861.74 --> 2862.54]  Jesus Christ
[2862.54 --> 2863.30]  who by His
[2863.30 --> 2864.30]  life, death,
[2864.30 --> 2865.02]  and resurrection
[2865.02 --> 2866.20]  opened to us
[2866.20 --> 2866.98]  the way of
[2866.98 --> 2868.32]  everlasting life.
[2869.20 --> 2869.54]  Amen.
[2872.24 --> 2873.46]  Our Lord Jesus
[2873.46 --> 2874.70]  before He
[2874.70 --> 2875.62]  suffered gave
[2875.62 --> 2876.40]  us this
[2876.40 --> 2877.58]  memorial of
[2877.58 --> 2878.62]  His sacrifice
[2878.62 --> 2879.64]  until He
[2879.64 --> 2880.30]  comes again.
[2881.32 --> 2881.90]  And the Lord
[2881.90 --> 2883.42]  Jesus on the
[2883.42 --> 2883.92]  night that He
[2883.92 --> 2884.60]  was betrayed
[2884.60 --> 2885.96]  took bread.
[2886.64 --> 2887.04]  And when He
[2887.04 --> 2887.36]  had given
[2887.36 --> 2888.06]  thanks He
[2888.06 --> 2888.78]  broke it and
[2888.78 --> 2889.62]  He said this
[2889.62 --> 2890.66]  is my body
[2890.66 --> 2892.38]  which is for
[2892.38 --> 2892.64]  you.
[2893.20 --> 2893.96]  Do this
[2893.96 --> 2894.74]  in remembrance
[2894.74 --> 2895.84]  of me.
[2897.02 --> 2897.86]  In the same
[2897.86 --> 2898.40]  way He
[2898.40 --> 2898.84]  took the
[2898.84 --> 2899.80]  cup after
[2899.80 --> 2901.34]  supper saying
[2901.34 --> 2902.78]  this cup is
[2902.78 --> 2903.24]  the new
[2903.24 --> 2904.08]  covenant in
[2904.08 --> 2904.70]  my blood.
[2905.22 --> 2906.06]  Do this
[2906.06 --> 2907.02]  whenever you
[2907.02 --> 2908.06]  drink it in
[2908.06 --> 2909.46]  remembrance of
[2909.46 --> 2909.76]  me.
[2910.64 --> 2911.34]  For whenever
[2911.34 --> 2912.64]  we eat this
[2912.64 --> 2913.36]  bread and
[2913.36 --> 2914.02]  drink this
[2914.02 --> 2914.90]  cup we
[2914.90 --> 2915.76]  proclaim the
[2915.76 --> 2916.52]  Lord's death
[2916.52 --> 2917.88]  until He
[2917.88 --> 2918.62]  comes again.
[2919.30 --> 2920.92]  This is the
[2920.92 --> 2922.22]  mystery of
[2922.22 --> 2922.78]  our faith.
[2923.96 --> 2925.20]  Your death
[2925.20 --> 2925.96]  of Christ
[2925.96 --> 2926.78]  we proclaim
[2926.78 --> 2927.94]  your
[2927.94 --> 2928.52]  resurrection
[2928.52 --> 2929.50]  we affirm
[2929.50 --> 2930.14]  with joy
[2930.14 --> 2931.58]  your coming
[2931.58 --> 2932.32]  we await
[2932.32 --> 2932.98]  with hope
[2932.98 --> 2934.76]  glory be to
[2934.76 --> 2935.52]  you Lord
[2935.52 --> 2936.06]  Jesus.
[2937.12 --> 2938.34]  Church family
[2938.34 --> 2939.42]  the Lord has
[2939.42 --> 2940.06]  prepared His
[2940.06 --> 2941.08]  table for all
[2941.08 --> 2942.14]  who love
[2942.14 --> 2942.92]  Him and
[2942.92 --> 2943.66]  trust in Him
[2943.66 --> 2944.40]  alone for
[2944.40 --> 2945.04]  their salvation
[2945.04 --> 2946.28]  and so come
[2946.28 --> 2948.00]  to this table
[2948.00 --> 2950.08]  you who have
[2950.08 --> 2950.90]  been here
[2950.90 --> 2951.38]  before.
[2952.38 --> 2952.82]  Come to
[2952.82 --> 2953.56]  this table
[2953.56 --> 2954.52]  you who
[2954.52 --> 2955.30]  have much
[2955.30 --> 2955.92]  faith and
[2955.92 --> 2956.32]  you who
[2956.32 --> 2956.72]  would like
[2956.72 --> 2957.10]  to have
[2957.10 --> 2957.44]  more.
[2958.22 --> 2958.80]  Come to
[2958.80 --> 2959.32]  this table
[2959.32 --> 2959.80]  you who
[2959.80 --> 2960.14]  have been
[2960.14 --> 2960.54]  to this
[2960.54 --> 2960.96]  sacrament
[2960.96 --> 2962.20]  often and
[2962.20 --> 2962.58]  you who
[2962.58 --> 2963.06]  have not
[2963.06 --> 2964.08]  been for a
[2964.08 --> 2964.54]  long time.
[2964.68 --> 2965.08]  Come to
[2965.08 --> 2965.58]  this table
[2965.58 --> 2966.22]  you who
[2966.22 --> 2967.20]  have tried
[2967.20 --> 2967.84]  to follow
[2967.84 --> 2969.18]  Jesus and
[2969.18 --> 2969.66]  you who
[2969.66 --> 2970.36]  have failed.
[2970.78 --> 2971.30]  Come to
[2971.30 --> 2971.94]  this table
[2971.94 --> 2972.72]  because Jesus
[2972.72 --> 2973.50]  is raised
[2973.50 --> 2974.22]  and He
[2974.22 --> 2975.02]  invites you.
[2975.34 --> 2975.72]  Come to
[2975.72 --> 2976.24]  this table
[2976.24 --> 2976.92]  because this
[2976.92 --> 2977.60]  is His
[2977.60 --> 2978.86]  table set
[2978.86 --> 2980.00]  for you.
[2981.20 --> 2981.64]  These are
[2981.64 --> 2982.00]  the gifts
[2982.00 --> 2982.62]  of God
[2982.62 --> 2983.54]  for the
[2983.54 --> 2984.68]  people of
[2984.68 --> 2985.04]  God.
[2986.40 --> 2987.10]  As we
[2987.10 --> 2988.08]  come to
[2988.08 --> 2988.70]  this table
[2988.70 --> 2989.80]  we have a
[2989.80 --> 2990.20]  bit of a
[2990.20 --> 2991.06]  process that
[2991.06 --> 2991.72]  we do here.
[2992.16 --> 2992.94]  We come up
[2992.94 --> 2993.50]  in groups
[2993.50 --> 2994.02]  and so we
[2994.02 --> 2994.30]  will have
[2994.30 --> 2995.00]  ushers that
[2995.00 --> 2995.60]  will indicate
[2995.60 --> 2996.00]  when it's
[2996.00 --> 2996.44]  time for
[2996.44 --> 2996.88]  your row
[2996.88 --> 2997.30]  to come
[2997.30 --> 2997.74]  forward
[2997.74 --> 2998.80]  and then
[2998.80 --> 2999.06]  we will
[2999.06 --> 2999.32]  gather
[2999.32 --> 2999.88]  around
[2999.88 --> 3000.56]  and we
[3000.56 --> 3001.02]  will pass
[3001.02 --> 3001.66]  the elements
[3001.66 --> 3003.12]  to the
[3003.12 --> 3003.62]  left or
[3003.62 --> 3003.92]  to your
[3003.92 --> 3004.42]  right depending
[3004.42 --> 3004.78]  on which
[3004.78 --> 3005.04]  way you
[3005.04 --> 3005.24]  go.
[3005.32 --> 3005.66]  As you
[3005.66 --> 3006.16]  pass the
[3006.16 --> 3006.98]  bread we
[3006.98 --> 3007.48]  invite you
[3007.48 --> 3007.90]  to say
[3007.90 --> 3008.42]  the body
[3008.42 --> 3008.96]  of Christ
[3008.96 --> 3009.46]  given for
[3009.46 --> 3009.70]  you.
[3009.92 --> 3010.26]  As you
[3010.26 --> 3010.74]  pass the
[3010.74 --> 3011.26]  juice we
[3011.26 --> 3011.66]  invite you
[3011.66 --> 3012.04]  to say

[3012.78 --> 3013.32]  of Christ
[3013.32 --> 3013.90]  shed for
[3013.90 --> 3014.12]  you.
[3014.88 --> 3015.32]  If you
[3015.32 --> 3015.78]  are unable
[3015.78 --> 3016.18]  to come
[3016.18 --> 3016.46]  to the
[3016.46 --> 3016.86]  front but
[3016.86 --> 3017.20]  would like
[3017.20 --> 3017.92]  to participate
[3017.92 --> 3018.32]  in the

[3020.64 --> 3020.90]  they will
[3020.90 --> 3021.44]  meet you
[3021.44 --> 3021.86]  where you

[3024.16 --> 3024.54]  the same
[3024.54 --> 3025.12]  manner as
[3025.12 --> 3025.38]  we are
[3025.38 --> 3025.74]  all being
[3025.74 --> 3026.26]  served up
[3026.26 --> 3026.44]  here.
[3027.20 --> 3027.66]  As well
[3027.66 --> 3028.12]  on each
[3028.12 --> 3028.70]  tray of

[4712.84 --> 4732.58]  Good morning, congregation.
[4732.58 --> 4739.48]  The reason for my being here is if you enter the sanctuary, you'll see all these little
[4739.48 --> 4741.74]  flags and cake out there.
[4741.74 --> 4744.02]  You're probably wondering what that's about.
[4744.02 --> 4750.34]  We've invited the Agile family to be here about this time, and I noticed Talala's here.
[4750.34 --> 4756.76]  But anyway, what I'm going to do is rather than wait around for them to show up, I just
[4756.76 --> 4764.94]  want to say that as a refugee sponsorship committee that we've been so thankful that the Agile
[4764.94 --> 4770.14]  family has achieved their citizenship, so they are now Canadian citizens.
[4770.14 --> 4773.58]  And they also, each of them, have a passport.
[4773.58 --> 4779.52]  So first of all, there's the family, Nawaf and Noof, and they came here with two children,
[4779.52 --> 4781.82]  Mohammed and Ibrahim.
[4781.82 --> 4785.76]  And since that time they've been here, they've had another one.
[4785.76 --> 4794.80]  And so with citizenship, before you get that, you have a certain level of language understanding,
[4794.80 --> 4796.50]  and they have achieved that.
[4796.50 --> 4801.18]  And they've been to school, and all these different types of things.
[4801.18 --> 4805.00]  And they've had another, they've had a baby while they're here.
[4805.00 --> 4808.44]  Talal, come here.
[4808.44 --> 4809.44]  Anyway.
[4809.44 --> 4824.44]  Talal is totally hearing impaired, and so if you wonder why, he's my buddy, my buddy here.
[4824.44 --> 4830.02]  But anyway, with, with, he came with his, with his brother Nawaf and Noof and their two, and
[4830.02 --> 4835.06]  their two children, in September 2017.
[4835.06 --> 4841.06]  And so, we're looking at almost six, seven years to, to get the process.
[4841.06 --> 4844.40]  And as you know, through COVID and everything, everything slowed down.
[4844.40 --> 4848.10]  But they have all the documentation now, including a passport.
[4848.10 --> 4852.10]  As a matter of fact, Nawaf and Noof had saved up enough money.
[4852.10 --> 4857.06]  And so once they had their passport, they flew to Kuwait to connect with their family over
[4857.06 --> 4858.06]  there.
[4858.06 --> 4860.20]  And so that was awesome.
[4860.20 --> 4863.42]  That was awesome for them.
[4863.42 --> 4866.94]  So Talal is the brother of Nawaf.
[4866.94 --> 4872.90]  And Talal, as, when, when the committee we looked at, at sponsoring, we knew that he was
[4872.90 --> 4878.74]  coming along, and we, we, we were certainly happy to have him come.
[4878.74 --> 4884.60]  But he's been a wonderful friend, and a great addition to a Canadian society.
[4884.60 --> 4891.66]  So Nawaf also works, has had a steady job right from the get-go, and with, actually with Eric
[4891.66 --> 4893.94]  Paquette's company.
[4893.94 --> 4902.66]  And Talal works for my son Eric's, and Tracy's company in the, in the landscape division.
[4902.66 --> 4907.66]  Anyway, the interesting thing here is for, for Talal.
[4907.66 --> 4919.24]  All right, what does that, so online he's discovered that there is a girl in Morocco who he's, he's
[4919.24 --> 4920.80]  going to visit.
[4920.80 --> 4930.16]  He leaves on July 2, he'll be flying over there, and then he'll be, everything's set up for him
[4930.16 --> 4933.96]  to go with the girl, to, to get married.
[4933.96 --> 4939.16]  And then he'll come back at the end of July, and then we'll begin the process of bringing
[4939.16 --> 4943.16]  her over to, to, to Canada.
[4943.16 --> 4944.16]  Anyway, let's.
[4944.16 --> 4950.16]  What are you, what's your, uh, they're here?
[4950.16 --> 4952.16]  They're coming.
[4952.16 --> 4953.16]  They're coming.
[4953.16 --> 4962.16]  Okay, so what we want to do, of course, is, uh, we want to, uh, serve you cake when you're,
[4962.16 --> 4963.16]  you're out there.
[4963.16 --> 4970.16]  Many of you have had access, many of you have known, have been supporters, uh, of, for when
[4970.16 --> 4971.16]  we began.
[4971.16 --> 4976.16]  And so it, it's going to be nice just to, uh, explain that, uh, to them.
