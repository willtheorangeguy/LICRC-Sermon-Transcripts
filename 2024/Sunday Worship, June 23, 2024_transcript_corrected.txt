[2819.48 → 2849.48] Thank you.
[2849.48 → 2879.46] Thank you.
[2879.48 → 2909.46] Good morning,
[2909.46 → 2939.44] You lost your voice.
[2939.44 → 2969.44] Thank you.
[2969.44 → 2999.44] Thank you.
[2999.44 → 3029.42] Thank you.
[3029.44 → 3059.42] Thank you.
[3059.42 → 3089.40] Thank you.
[3089.40 → 3119.38] Thank you.
[3119.38 → 3149.36] Thank you.
[3149.36 → 3179.36] Thank you.
[3179.36 → 3209.34] Thank you.
[3209.34 → 3239.34] You.
[3239.34 → 3269.34] Thank you.
[3269.34 → 3299.32] Thank you.
[3299.34 → 3329.32] Thank you.
[3329.34 → 3359.32] Thank you.
[3359.34 → 3389.32] Thank you.
[3389.34 → 3419.32] All the stuff.
[3419.34 → 3449.32] Good morning.
[3449.34 → 3479.34] Thank you.
[3479.34 → 3509.34] 
[3509.34 → 3539.34] I don't think you're,
[3539.34 → 3569.32] you're, you know,
[3569.32 → 3599.30] Harpers, you're, you know, but we've got a little hero, but I think of, you.
[3599.30 → 3602.86] The article goes on to kind of describe it as when we forgive,
[3602.98 → 3607.32] it feels like we're letting people get away with the stuff they did.
[3607.92 → 3612.78] And if you're in the wrong, well, cancel you, even if you're willing to change.
[3614.02 → 3617.70] It's kind of the world we live in a little bit, so trivialized.
[3618.68 → 3623.12] Now, forgiveness, quick forgiveness can be a problem when it doesn't include justice,
[3623.26 → 3625.22] and I think that's what that's poking at a bit.
[3625.22 → 3630.22] But without forgiveness, reconciliation is not possible.
[3631.26 → 3634.36] It only keeps divisiveness going.
[3635.22 → 3637.90] And that's why Scripture says, forgive as you've been forgiven,
[3638.20 → 3642.92] because it recognizes that we all need forgiveness in order to see healing.
[3644.02 → 3647.82] Forgiveness is an essential to our relational fabric of our lives,
[3647.98 → 3651.46] our relationship with God, and our relationships with one another.
[3651.46 → 3658.04] Because without that, we won't stay humble knowing that we need forgiveness too.
[3659.42 → 3664.42] And the people who know how to forgive, they know how to receive forgiveness.
[3664.58 → 3666.54] Those two go hand in hand.
[3668.04 → 3670.42] So, we're going to jump a little bit into some Scriptures,
[3671.20 → 3674.90] and I'm going to offer you some ideas about what forgiveness isn't,
[3675.00 → 3676.54] and then what forgiveness is.
[3676.54 → 3679.98] Matthew 6, we read this.
[3680.90 → 3681.94] Hopefully it's all up there.
[3682.04 → 3682.38] Ah, good.
[3684.04 → 3684.82] Jesus says,
[3684.94 → 3687.46] And forgive us our debts, our trespasses, our sins.
[3687.54 → 3691.42] Forgive us our debts, as we have forgiven those who have sinned, or are debtors.
[3692.14 → 3695.66] And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.
[3695.68 → 3696.22] And then this.
[3697.06 → 3700.46] For if you forgive other people when they sin against you,
[3700.56 → 3702.70] your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
[3702.70 → 3706.32] But if you do not forgive others their sins,
[3706.52 → 3709.72] your Father will not forgive your sins.
[3711.62 → 3713.70] That ought to freak us out a little bit.
[3715.18 → 3717.58] That ought to stop us in our tracks.
[3718.74 → 3723.78] If I don't forgive somebody else, I won't be forgiven.
[3724.64 → 3727.62] And then my prayers are kind of a waste of time.
[3729.74 → 3731.68] My sins will be held against me.
[3732.70 → 3733.74] That ought to stop us.
[3734.86 → 3736.58] How does that even go?
[3738.02 → 3738.26] Right?
[3739.00 → 3742.02] I'd like to look at a case study out of the life of Jesus there.
[3742.32 → 3746.22] The case study of the woman who comes to the Pharisee's house,
[3746.48 → 3749.56] and she anoints Jesus' feet, and then she wipes his feet with her hair.
[3750.00 → 3752.76] Let's look at what Luke says on that.
[3752.76 → 3759.02] When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, this is Luke 7, 39,
[3759.38 → 3761.00] he said to himself,
[3761.82 → 3765.08] if this man were a prophet, he would know who was touching him
[3765.08 → 3769.06] and what kind of woman she is, that she is a sinner.
[3769.06 → 3773.14] Jesus answered him, this Pharisee,
[3773.22 → 3774.32] Simon, I have something to tell you.
[3774.46 → 3775.44] Tell me, teacher, he said.
[3775.94 → 3778.58] All right, two people owed money to a certain moneylender.
[3778.82 → 3781.88] One owed him 500 denarii, the other 50.
[3782.20 → 3783.86] Neither of them had the money to pay him back,
[3784.02 → 3785.68] so he forgave the debts of both.
[3785.80 → 3787.26] Now, which will love him more?
[3788.22 → 3789.10] And Simon replied,
[3789.10 → 3790.84] I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven.
[3791.38 → 3793.72] You have judged correctly, Jesus said.
[3794.54 → 3795.60] And I love this picture.
[3795.74 → 3797.14] Just see it in your mind here.
[3797.48 → 3799.04] Then he turned toward the woman.
[3799.14 → 3800.68] So now they're looking at the woman,
[3800.78 → 3801.90] but he's still talking to Simon.
[3802.14 → 3803.32] Then he turned toward the woman,
[3803.40 → 3804.08] and he said to Simon,
[3804.40 → 3806.02] do you see this woman?
[3807.72 → 3809.32] It's a real honest question.
[3809.44 → 3811.38] Do you actually see her?
[3812.74 → 3814.62] That's more than just a piece of dirt.
[3816.10 → 3817.24] Do you see her?
[3817.24 → 3819.26] I came into your house.
[3819.60 → 3821.10] You did not give me any water for my feet,
[3821.16 → 3822.04] which would have been customary,
[3822.20 → 3823.80] but she wet my feet with her tears
[3823.80 → 3824.80] and wiped them with her hair.
[3825.20 → 3826.40] You did not give me a kiss,
[3826.46 → 3827.18] which is a greeting,
[3827.58 → 3829.24] but this woman from the time I answered
[3829.24 → 3830.52] has not stopped kissing my feet.
[3830.84 → 3832.62] You did not put oil on my head,
[3832.74 → 3833.82] which was also customary,
[3833.98 → 3835.62] and she has poured perfume on my feet.
[3836.24 → 3838.50] Therefore, I tell you,
[3838.60 → 3840.60] her many sins have been forgiven,
[3841.44 → 3843.84] as her great love has shown.
[3844.60 → 3846.98] But whoever has been forgiven little,
[3847.24 → 3848.82] loves little.
[3848.92 → 3850.06] Let that one sink in.
[3850.38 → 3852.18] Whoever has been forgiven little,
[3852.46 → 3853.88] loves little.
[3854.60 → 3855.46] Then Jesus said,
[3855.52 → 3856.50] your sins are forgiven.
[3857.52 → 3859.84] The other guests began to say among themselves,
[3859.98 → 3862.10] who is this who even forgives sins?
[3862.84 → 3863.80] And Jesus said to the woman,
[3863.92 → 3865.10] your faith has saved you.
[3866.04 → 3867.40] Go in peace.
[3868.42 → 3869.46] And here we see Simon,
[3869.46 → 3870.92] a religious leader,
[3871.30 → 3873.12] who certainly doesn't put himself
[3873.12 → 3874.92] in the same place as this woman.
[3875.88 → 3877.16] What a sinner.
[3877.38 → 3878.46] And I'm going to ask you,
[3878.58 → 3880.88] picture where you might do something similar.
[3882.30 → 3883.38] What a sinner.
[3883.68 → 3884.70] I'm not in the same place.
[3884.80 → 3885.56] And this Jesus,
[3885.68 → 3886.02] look at him.
[3886.20 → 3887.08] He engages with her.
[3887.12 → 3888.08] He lets her touch him.
[3888.14 → 3889.80] What kind of religious leader is he?
[3889.80 → 3892.76] And we see this religious leader's reaction to sin
[3892.76 → 3895.14] versus this clearly sinful woman.
[3895.40 → 3896.46] Or we might say,
[3896.78 → 3898.86] we have one blind to his own sins
[3898.86 → 3902.30] versus one who knows her sins only too well.
[3904.66 → 3906.76] And only one of these people is forgiven.
[3907.68 → 3908.20] Guess who?
[3910.44 → 3912.46] Forgive as you've been forgiven.
[3912.46 → 3915.82] And now here's the thought.
[3917.48 → 3920.96] But if you don't think you've been forgiven profoundly,
[3922.20 → 3922.94] profoundly,
[3923.54 → 3926.62] you won't know how to forgive profoundly.
[3927.32 → 3931.02] And you then won't know how to love profoundly.
[3933.40 → 3935.40] Imagine the desperation of this woman
[3935.40 → 3936.58] coming into this house.
[3936.68 → 3938.08] She went into the house of the Pharisee
[3938.08 → 3939.52] knowing full well how they felt about her.
[3940.14 → 3941.74] But she went in with her sins,
[3941.74 → 3942.58] with her desperation.
[3942.80 → 3944.84] She went in to see Jesus.
[3945.52 → 3947.74] Her tears flowing in an act of worship
[3947.74 → 3950.60] because she sees the possibility
[3950.60 → 3952.70] of grace with Jesus.
[3954.30 → 3957.64] And that draws her more than her fear of the judgment.
[3959.02 → 3961.46] For those who have been forgiven much,
[3961.98 → 3964.90] well, there's great love and great grace available.
[3965.32 → 3967.22] But whoever has been forgiven little,
[3967.60 → 3968.62] loves little.
[3970.52 → 3971.42] And I don't want to ask you,
[3971.42 → 3973.86] do you feel profoundly forgiven?
[3978.38 → 3980.84] I think it's what we need to be hearing alongside of Simon.
[3981.02 → 3983.64] We need to hear that we've been forgiven much
[3983.64 → 3986.58] in order to make us desperate enough
[3986.58 → 3989.22] to be receiving and open to profound forgiveness.
[3989.64 → 3991.82] That's what you actually need.
[3991.82 → 3994.62] Not just a little prayer,
[3994.76 → 3995.98] okay, Lord, forgive me of my sins,
[3996.04 → 3997.06] whatever they might be.
[4000.36 → 4002.28] Because with that comes profound love.
[4004.46 → 4006.18] Much love, as the Scripture says here.
[4007.18 → 4009.06] And you can hear a sign,
[4009.14 → 4011.04] are you saying I'm as bad as her?
[4011.04 → 4012.04] Yeah.
[4012.04 → 4013.04] Yeah.
[4013.46 → 4014.04] Yeah.
[4014.04 → 4020.46] All have profoundly sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[4020.46 → 4021.04] That's Scripture.
[4021.58 → 4024.68] Jesus died not because of your little bit of sinfulness.
[4025.00 → 4027.30] He died because your sins were so great,
[4027.52 → 4029.36] it demanded His death.
[4030.68 → 4031.66] Do you believe that?
[4033.78 → 4036.44] Do you believe Jesus had to die
[4036.44 → 4038.62] because your sin?
[4038.62 → 4048.08] You know, when we read through the Gospels,
[4048.18 → 4050.94] we see the centrality of forgiveness for everyone.
[4051.26 → 4054.68] It's not, you never come across someone who didn't need it badly.
[4055.34 → 4057.86] Forgiveness is essential to our very lives.
[4058.10 → 4060.26] And if we don't see that, we can't receive it,
[4060.40 → 4062.82] and we won't know how to give it.
[4064.80 → 4066.06] Forgiveness is death.
[4066.06 → 4069.24] It keeps us trapped in lies, in unawareness,
[4069.46 → 4070.84] in relational dysfunction.
[4071.46 → 4074.38] You need to forgive, and you need to receive forgiveness.
[4074.66 → 4074.90] Both.
[4075.14 → 4076.66] You can't receive God's forgiveness
[4076.66 → 4079.62] without knowing the depth of your brokenness.
[4080.04 → 4080.92] How's that going?
[4085.58 → 4088.28] And only then will you be able to forgive profound brokenness
[4088.28 → 4089.48] that harms you.
[4092.16 → 4094.64] In that honesty, we can then come to the Father
[4094.64 → 4096.62] and then begin to love and forgive like Him.
[4097.74 → 4099.66] Now, let me say a few things about
[4099.66 → 4101.92] some things that forgiveness isn't.
[4103.16 → 4105.36] Forgiveness isn't forgetting, right?
[4105.58 → 4107.26] You've heard the phrase, forgive and forget.
[4107.88 → 4109.62] It's even a title of a very good book.
[4111.04 → 4112.74] We are people who remember.
[4114.10 → 4118.06] Although I caution you not to replace the word remember with rehearse.
[4118.42 → 4119.62] Forgive and rehearse.
[4119.78 → 4122.78] Rehearse the wrong done to you over and over and over again.
[4122.78 → 4125.12] That's not what we're talking about here at all.
[4125.50 → 4129.32] Where you actually stew on and relive the events you claim to forgive.
[4130.68 → 4134.28] But, memory is part of the pain of forgiveness.
[4135.28 → 4137.76] The couple who live with the deep pain of betrayal
[4137.76 → 4139.44] don't forget the betrayal.
[4140.14 → 4141.52] They learn to love again.
[4141.58 → 4141.82] How?
[4142.06 → 4143.22] With the pain.
[4144.82 → 4146.20] With that pain.
[4146.20 → 4149.86] And that requires honesty.
[4150.02 → 4151.22] And that requires accountability.
[4151.56 → 4153.06] And that likely requires counselling.
[4153.40 → 4155.34] And there's a path for healing that is needed.
[4155.72 → 4159.06] Forgiveness isn't simply tossing the pain aside.
[4160.60 → 4163.10] Folks, I've seen marriages over the years of being a pastor
[4163.10 → 4164.60] survive and thrive
[4164.60 → 4167.98] when genuine confession leads to genuine forgiveness
[4167.98 → 4169.76] and long-term healing.
[4169.96 → 4170.60] Is it easy?
[4170.72 → 4171.70] It is not.
[4171.70 → 4174.26] And the one who is wrong
[4174.26 → 4175.68] needs to be deeply aware
[4175.68 → 4178.66] of how much forgiveness they need too.
[4180.36 → 4182.18] Because then you can stand together
[4182.18 → 4183.56] in your brokenness.
[4185.82 → 4187.34] Another thing forgiveness isn't.
[4188.84 → 4190.50] Forgiveness is not merely a feeling.
[4191.72 → 4192.84] There will be times
[4192.84 → 4194.32] when we will choose to forgive
[4194.32 → 4195.72] even though our feelings say otherwise.
[4197.48 → 4199.64] Anyone here ever have a nasty fight
[4199.64 → 4200.58] with someone they love?
[4202.36 → 4203.44] No, just me?
[4204.24 → 4204.56] Okay.
[4205.82 → 4206.18] Okay.
[4206.40 → 4206.70] All right.
[4206.78 → 4206.96] Yeah.
[4207.12 → 4207.36] Right?
[4207.42 → 4207.96] We all have.
[4208.48 → 4208.64] Right?
[4208.72 → 4209.42] Those are, in fact,
[4209.92 → 4211.16] I've been hurt, you know,
[4211.20 → 4212.20] by my wife and me
[4212.20 → 4213.12] and her and me
[4213.12 → 4215.56] because when you're that much in love
[4215.56 → 4217.80] you're also creating that much pain sometimes too,
[4217.86 → 4218.26] doesn't it?
[4219.06 → 4219.68] And my wife,
[4219.88 → 4220.74] she knows it well,
[4220.80 → 4221.72] she married a sinner.
[4222.72 → 4222.92] Right?
[4223.44 → 4225.98] And in moments of intense feelings
[4225.98 → 4227.38] things can be said
[4227.38 → 4228.32] that shouldn't have been said.
[4228.32 → 4230.78] And maybe it even feels satisfying
[4230.78 → 4231.46] in those moments
[4231.46 → 4232.86] to have said those things.
[4233.92 → 4236.56] I have the spiritual gift of sarcasm.
[4239.24 → 4241.22] But it doesn't always serve me
[4241.22 → 4242.90] particularly well in my marriage.
[4242.96 → 4244.96] And I found that out relatively quickly.
[4245.26 → 4246.88] Apparently my wife hates sarcasm.
[4248.22 → 4248.90] Go figure.
[4249.08 → 4249.78] There's some sarcasm.
[4249.88 → 4250.08] Anyway.
[4251.82 → 4253.74] And it does feel satisfying sometimes.
[4253.88 → 4254.00] You know,
[4254.04 → 4254.78] sometimes I think,
[4254.78 → 4256.50] oh, I'm amazed with the brilliance
[4256.50 → 4257.38] of my own sarcasm.
[4257.68 → 4258.98] As opposed to say,
[4259.06 → 4260.82] wow, I'm really causing pain with this.
[4265.88 → 4268.16] As one who has been forgiven by Jesus,
[4268.74 → 4270.62] I need to allow the Spirit of God
[4270.62 → 4272.72] to intervene into my thoughts
[4272.72 → 4275.50] and I need to choose humility before my Lord
[4275.50 → 4277.98] instead of being dictated by my feelings.
[4277.98 → 4280.66] And then ignore those strong feelings
[4280.66 → 4282.28] and choose to allow forgiveness
[4282.28 → 4283.30] and humility
[4283.30 → 4285.30] to redefine the broken moment.
[4285.58 → 4286.68] I think for some of us,
[4286.86 → 4288.52] we'd rather be right than loving.
[4291.32 → 4292.78] I want the argument
[4292.78 → 4294.02] feels way better than
[4294.02 → 4296.48] I humbly walked away from it
[4296.48 → 4297.76] because it was going poorly.
[4297.76 → 4304.52] And this isn't pretending,
[4304.92 → 4306.28] about pretending we're not hurt.
[4306.82 → 4308.46] Or it's not about an excuse
[4308.46 → 4310.76] to excuse or condone.
[4311.10 → 4313.16] But it is not the place
[4313.16 → 4315.34] where we allow emotion to run wild
[4315.34 → 4316.60] and then dictate the moment.
[4317.80 → 4318.94] I think most of us have been there.
[4319.82 → 4322.20] And we need to surrender the moment to grace
[4322.20 → 4324.04] and to love of the other
[4324.04 → 4325.96] and to coming before the Lord
[4325.96 → 4326.94] somehow together
[4326.94 → 4328.36] and then to follow Jesus
[4328.36 → 4329.98] to those hard places.
[4330.68 → 4331.84] Jesus who said,
[4332.32 → 4333.24] forgive them,
[4333.52 → 4334.48] when He said it on the cross,
[4334.72 → 4335.38] forgive them,
[4335.46 → 4337.34] they know not what they do.
[4339.52 → 4341.06] Well, what do you mean
[4341.06 → 4342.04] they know not what He does?
[4342.24 → 4343.36] They put them up there accidentally?
[4345.78 → 4346.64] But Jesus is saying,
[4346.86 → 4349.12] they really don't see the big picture at all,
[4349.18 → 4349.56] do they?
[4350.80 → 4351.46] Do they?
[4352.20 → 4352.36] Right?
[4352.68 → 4354.60] And I think we need to say the same thing.
[4354.84 → 4355.82] Lord, forgive us.
[4355.82 → 4357.46] We don't know what we're doing.
[4360.10 → 4361.52] We really don't.
[4362.22 → 4364.66] We don't see the whole picture by a long shot.
[4364.74 → 4366.62] We get caught up in the moments.
[4367.96 → 4369.66] Forgiveness does not mean,
[4369.82 → 4370.84] hear me well here,
[4371.28 → 4372.46] forgiveness does not mean
[4372.46 → 4374.12] something was not sin.
[4376.32 → 4378.16] Actually, just the opposite.
[4379.10 → 4381.86] Forgiveness is about seeing the sin,
[4381.86 → 4385.04] not disregarding it.
[4386.52 → 4388.42] Sometimes in our Christian worldview,
[4389.46 → 4391.70] at times we do something that's not right.
[4392.42 → 4393.90] In the name of forgiveness,
[4394.04 → 4395.10] we want to minimize the sin.
[4397.82 → 4398.90] Just let it go.
[4399.90 → 4400.80] That's forgiveness, right?
[4400.86 → 4401.48] Just let it go.
[4402.84 → 4404.24] After all, I forgive you.
[4404.24 → 4405.90] It's not that.
[4406.80 → 4409.14] We need to name the sin
[4409.14 → 4410.54] and then forgive that,
[4410.74 → 4413.26] which will mean working toward health and healing.
[4413.78 → 4415.76] Otherwise, it's kind of like,
[4416.22 → 4417.88] I was a teacher for many years.
[4418.76 → 4421.16] I think I even saw a former student here,
[4421.30 → 4422.24] which makes me feel old.
[4422.36 → 4422.56] But anyway,
[4422.56 → 4426.28] sometimes then it's like that kid
[4426.28 → 4427.40] who says sorry too fast.
[4428.92 → 4429.08] You know,
[4429.16 → 4429.54] you say,
[4429.74 → 4430.14] why did you,
[4430.24 → 4430.60] oh, sorry.
[4431.64 → 4432.50] They don't even hear.
[4432.60 → 4433.34] They really say,
[4433.42 → 4434.28] just go away.
[4434.34 → 4435.28] I don't want to hear about this.
[4436.18 → 4437.82] I want this done and over with.
[4438.08 → 4438.16] Here,
[4438.28 → 4439.72] and so you just say sorry
[4439.72 → 4440.78] as fast as you can.
[4440.86 → 4441.78] Hopefully, it'll go away.
[4442.36 → 4444.36] Forgiveness and justice go hand in hand,
[4444.60 → 4445.74] which is so different
[4445.74 → 4447.20] than payback and vengeance
[4447.20 → 4447.98] and getting evil.
[4448.94 → 4449.92] So with that in mind,
[4449.92 → 4453.70] forgiveness is not allowing
[4453.70 → 4456.10] wrongdoers to carry on.
[4457.42 → 4459.16] How many of you remember the story
[4459.16 → 4461.68] about Rachel Hollander?
[4463.32 → 4463.80] Anyone here?
[4465.36 → 4467.18] She was a gymnast.
[4468.46 → 4469.08] Well, maybe you remember
[4469.08 → 4471.36] the villain's name in the story,
[4472.10 → 4473.76] Larry NASCAR.
[4475.60 → 4476.08] Right?
[4476.68 → 4478.36] And yeah,
[4478.36 → 4481.52] NASCAR sexually abused
[4481.52 → 4483.52] a whack of these girls,
[4483.64 → 4484.36] these gymnasts.
[4484.88 → 4487.02] He was the U.S. gymnastic team doctor.
[4488.96 → 4490.32] Rachel was 15 years old
[4490.32 → 4492.44] when NASCAR started abusing her
[4492.44 → 4493.60] and she was the first
[4493.60 → 4494.66] to make public allegations
[4494.66 → 4496.44] against this respected doctor.
[4497.62 → 4498.70] Hollander became
[4498.70 → 4501.70] the last of more than 150 survivors,
[4502.04 → 4502.68] all women,
[4502.78 → 4503.82] almost all of them gymnasts,
[4503.82 → 4505.56] to share her impact statement
[4505.56 → 4506.86] in court with NASCAR
[4506.86 → 4507.90] who was convicted
[4507.90 → 4508.84] of seven counts
[4508.84 → 4510.84] of first degree criminal sexual contact
[4510.84 → 4513.78] and sentenced up to 175 years
[4513.78 → 4514.76] in prison.
[4517.28 → 4519.66] This is what Rachel said to him
[4519.66 → 4520.26] in court.
[4521.98 → 4522.98] Rachel, who, by the way,
[4523.02 → 4523.86] is a devout Christian.
[4525.30 → 4526.38] Here are her words.
[4526.38 → 4529.54] I pray you experience
[4529.54 → 4532.40] the soul-crushing guilt
[4532.40 → 4535.44] so that you may someday
[4535.44 → 4537.86] experience true repentance
[4537.86 → 4540.98] and true forgiveness from God,
[4541.76 → 4542.92] which you need far more
[4542.92 → 4544.30] than forgiveness from me,
[4544.80 → 4546.84] though I extend that to you
[4546.84 → 4548.52] as well.
[4550.22 → 4551.30] You hear it?
[4551.42 → 4552.20] You hear the tone?
[4552.20 → 4557.32] You need to feel, Dr. NASCAR,
[4557.60 → 4559.18] the pain you cause.
[4559.36 → 4562.42] You need to let it crush you
[4562.42 → 4565.66] and then come to God
[4565.66 → 4569.30] so that you can find true repentance.
[4574.64 → 4576.20] You can see her speak
[4576.20 → 4578.60] on YouTube and stuff, too.
[4578.72 → 4580.74] It's powerful stuff.
[4582.20 → 4584.94] With that in mind,
[4585.08 → 4588.10] forgiveness isn't a one-moment thing,
[4588.14 → 4589.28] a one-and-done thing,
[4589.34 → 4589.90] a season.
[4590.12 → 4590.78] It's a discipline.
[4590.90 → 4591.52] It's a practice.
[4591.88 → 4592.72] It involves following
[4592.72 → 4593.96] and forgiving like Jesus
[4593.96 → 4595.02] on an ongoing matter.
[4595.96 → 4597.56] So now some thoughts around,
[4597.84 → 4598.48] I've been talking about
[4598.48 → 4599.44] what forgiveness isn't,
[4599.50 → 4600.04] some thoughts around
[4600.04 → 4600.98] what forgiveness is.
[4601.38 → 4602.64] Forgiveness is
[4602.64 → 4604.54] when we return to God
[4604.54 → 4606.74] the right to carry out justice
[4606.74 → 4609.52] now and in the days to come.
[4610.00 → 4611.02] Vengeance is mine,
[4611.20 → 4611.78] says the Lord.
[4612.20 → 4613.34] We can feel like
[4613.34 → 4614.20] we know better
[4614.20 → 4615.30] the desire for vengeance,
[4615.46 → 4616.44] for getting evil,
[4616.78 → 4617.42] even rather,
[4617.80 → 4619.58] as if we know it all.
[4623.88 → 4625.72] And we confess God knows best
[4625.72 → 4626.94] so we give God the reins.
[4628.36 → 4629.32] That doesn't mean to say,
[4629.40 → 4629.66] by the way,
[4629.68 → 4630.66] that we don't seek justice.
[4632.12 → 4633.78] Forgiveness is when we desire
[4633.78 → 4635.66] to do good instead of evil.
[4635.66 → 4636.22] Right?
[4636.34 → 4638.98] It frees us from seeking out harm.
[4639.08 → 4640.08] You hear that in Rachel
[4640.08 → 4641.30] and Hollander's line there,
[4641.36 → 4641.56] right?
[4641.90 → 4642.00] Right?
[4642.22 → 4643.88] That you get to that place,
[4644.00 → 4644.68] Dr. Nasser,
[4644.92 → 4646.46] of true repentance.
[4646.90 → 4648.20] That's where you need to go.
[4648.34 → 4649.82] I will give you forgiveness.
[4650.36 → 4651.60] But that's not really
[4651.60 → 4652.52] what you need.
[4652.52 → 4657.40] So yeah,
[4657.52 → 4659.40] consequences for bad behaviour.
[4659.52 → 4659.62] Yeah,
[4659.68 → 4661.02] 175 years in jail,
[4661.06 → 4661.76] you're going to die in jail.
[4661.84 → 4661.96] Yeah,
[4662.04 → 4662.92] that's fitting.
[4666.20 → 4667.72] But the hope of good
[4667.72 → 4669.16] for the one who harmed us
[4669.16 → 4670.46] can be a part of that.
[4673.66 → 4674.34] Scripture says,
[4674.48 → 4675.58] beauty for ashes.
[4675.58 → 4681.98] Forgiveness is an unmerited gift.
[4683.28 → 4684.78] It isn't earned.
[4685.14 → 4685.84] It's given.
[4686.30 → 4686.50] You know,
[4686.54 → 4687.36] we may tend to be
[4687.36 → 4688.48] like the Pharisee, right?
[4688.74 → 4689.76] Evil is evil.
[4689.92 → 4690.44] Avoid it.
[4690.66 → 4691.66] There's some truth to that.
[4691.98 → 4693.08] Keep yourself clean
[4693.08 → 4694.10] by avoiding all those
[4694.10 → 4694.62] who are evil
[4694.62 → 4696.82] because you're better than I.
[4701.12 → 4702.72] We can look around in the world
[4702.72 → 4703.00] and
[4703.00 → 4707.24] sometimes I see
[4707.24 → 4708.24] Christian reactions.
[4710.94 → 4712.16] I get discouraged.
[4713.68 → 4714.46] I've never seen a picture
[4714.46 → 4715.02] of a
[4715.02 → 4716.88] protest
[4716.88 → 4717.70] against the
[4717.70 → 4718.40] gay movement
[4718.40 → 4718.98] but, you know,
[4719.04 → 4720.02] people holding up signs
[4720.02 → 4720.24] saying,
[4720.34 → 4721.40] God hates fags.
[4721.58 → 4721.68] I go,
[4722.68 → 4723.20] oh,
[4723.56 → 4725.28] I understand
[4725.28 → 4726.30] where you're coming from
[4726.30 → 4726.68] that, you know,
[4726.72 → 4727.58] we're trying to
[4727.58 → 4728.52] address this
[4728.52 → 4730.58] but not like that.
[4731.96 → 4732.96] Not like that.
[4733.00 → 4739.32] So,
[4739.46 → 4739.72] forgiveness
[4739.72 → 4740.78] may happen,
[4741.32 → 4741.54] you know,
[4741.58 → 4742.46] when we sometimes
[4742.46 → 4743.44] get to those places.
[4743.90 → 4745.02] Forgiveness might happen
[4745.02 → 4746.38] if I think I'm better than you
[4746.38 → 4747.28] but only when you
[4747.28 → 4748.28] clean yourself up
[4748.28 → 4749.16] and not until then.
[4752.64 → 4753.12] Forgiveness
[4753.12 → 4754.10] is given
[4754.10 → 4754.96] in the trenches.
[4755.16 → 4755.86] It's given
[4755.86 → 4757.34] in the brokenness.
[4757.48 → 4759.34] While we were yet sinners,
[4759.52 → 4760.44] Christ came to us.
[4760.66 → 4761.64] He didn't come to us
[4761.64 → 4761.86] and say,
[4761.96 → 4762.32] well, okay,
[4762.62 → 4763.32] clean yourself up
[4763.32 → 4764.28] and I might show up later.
[4764.36 → 4765.02] He didn't say that.
[4765.48 → 4766.86] It's not easy
[4766.86 → 4767.56] to forgive.
[4767.56 → 4772.74] You know,
[4772.80 → 4772.96] my,
[4773.02 → 4776.30] my dad passed away
[4776.30 → 4777.14] about five years ago.
[4780.92 → 4781.30] And,
[4781.52 → 4783.78] my dad was very loving
[4783.78 → 4784.44] but he was also,
[4784.90 → 4785.94] he created a lot of pain
[4785.94 → 4786.40] in my life.
[4788.08 → 4789.42] A lot of it involved
[4789.42 → 4791.28] rage and anger issues.
[4793.60 → 4794.88] He was a complicated guy.
[4794.88 → 4794.92] He was a complicated guy.
[4794.92 → 4800.74] It took me a long time
[4800.74 → 4801.86] to get to that place
[4801.86 → 4803.16] where I could forgive,
[4804.14 → 4805.96] where I was healthy enough
[4805.96 → 4807.78] to forgive.
[4809.26 → 4810.30] A lot of counselling,
[4811.02 → 4812.20] a lot of prayer.
[4813.50 → 4814.30] I once read a quote
[4814.30 → 4814.62] that says,
[4814.70 → 4815.64] forgiveness is setting
[4815.64 → 4816.20] someone free
[4816.20 → 4816.76] and realizing
[4816.76 → 4817.70] the person is you.
[4817.70 → 4822.28] I remember somebody,
[4822.46 → 4823.26] I shared my story
[4823.26 → 4823.56] with somebody
[4823.56 → 4823.90] and they said,
[4823.98 → 4824.04] oh,
[4824.10 → 4824.32] how did,
[4824.80 → 4825.14] you know,
[4825.18 → 4826.08] my dad was still alive
[4826.08 → 4827.04] at the time
[4827.04 → 4827.38] and I said,
[4827.56 → 4828.00] how are you,
[4828.12 → 4829.28] how do you deal with that?
[4830.00 → 4830.62] And I answered,
[4830.70 → 4831.30] I don't
[4831.30 → 4832.40] but eventually
[4832.40 → 4833.24] I'm going to kick
[4833.24 → 4834.42] the crap out of his coffin.
[4840.12 → 4840.62] I don't,
[4840.82 → 4841.68] I didn't feel that way
[4841.68 → 4842.12] when he died
[4842.12 → 4845.56] because I did the hard work
[4845.56 → 4847.16] of forgiveness
[4847.16 → 4849.92] and I died
[4849.92 → 4851.70] or he died
[4851.70 → 4852.32] with me
[4852.32 → 4853.38] and the family
[4853.38 → 4853.82] with him
[4853.82 → 4854.54] and loving him
[4854.54 → 4855.46] and caring for him
[4855.46 → 4857.48] and it was a lot better
[4857.48 → 4858.66] than where I was
[4858.66 → 4859.24] at one point.
[4859.24 → 4865.70] When I forgave
[4865.70 → 4866.50] and learned to forgive,
[4866.72 → 4867.60] I felt more free
[4867.60 → 4868.62] to love my broken dad
[4868.62 → 4870.50] and I learned
[4870.50 → 4871.74] to become far more aware
[4871.74 → 4873.78] of how forgiven I am
[4873.78 → 4875.46] and I realized this
[4875.46 → 4876.96] and this was an important lesson
[4876.96 → 4879.08] and that I was not better
[4879.08 → 4879.84] than him.
[4883.36 → 4884.60] He was a broken man,
[4886.10 → 4888.22] a sinner like me
[4888.22 → 4889.22] and I was not better
[4889.24 → 4890.60] but forgiveness
[4890.60 → 4891.70] frees us
[4891.70 → 4893.02] and hopefully
[4893.02 → 4894.88] frees the one,
[4895.48 → 4896.80] hopefully to forgive
[4896.80 → 4898.32] the one who has harmed us.
[4899.68 → 4900.50] Hebrews 12,
[4900.70 → 4901.66] because here's the other option,
[4901.78 → 4903.00] Hebrews 12, 15 says,
[4903.46 → 4904.24] where scripture says,
[4904.32 → 4905.26] see to it that no one
[4905.26 → 4906.10] falls short
[4906.10 → 4907.08] of the grace of God.
[4907.14 → 4908.04] What does that mean?
[4908.22 → 4909.24] Fall short of the grace of God.
[4909.54 → 4910.70] That no bitter root
[4910.70 → 4911.72] grows up
[4911.72 → 4912.34] to cause trouble
[4912.34 → 4912.90] and defile many.
[4913.32 → 4915.12] If you don't forgive well,
[4915.50 → 4917.26] bitterness is the other option.
[4919.96 → 4921.70] And bitterness destroys.
[4923.70 → 4925.08] Forgiveness enslaves us.
[4925.16 → 4926.04] I've seen it too often.
[4926.36 → 4927.04] And we need to go
[4927.04 → 4928.56] to that place of slavery
[4928.56 → 4930.00] and uproot that bitterness
[4930.00 → 4930.84] and that pain
[4930.84 → 4931.76] and that grudge keeping
[4931.76 → 4932.64] and that score keeping.
[4932.88 → 4934.16] And we need to learn to forgive
[4934.16 → 4936.52] because Christ forgives you
[4936.52 → 4937.54] profoundly.
[4937.54 → 4943.26] God takes it all
[4943.26 → 4944.36] and He gives us His peace
[4944.36 → 4945.00] and His freedom
[4945.00 → 4945.60] and His spirit
[4945.60 → 4946.18] and His healing.
[4947.36 → 4947.84] And then this,
[4948.00 → 4948.76] we do forgiveness
[4948.76 → 4949.40] in community.
[4950.58 → 4952.02] I appreciated the guitar player,
[4952.14 → 4952.40] right,
[4952.54 → 4953.78] when he started talking
[4953.78 → 4954.12] a little bit
[4954.12 → 4954.76] about his own stuff
[4954.76 → 4955.16] a little bit.
[4956.00 → 4956.26] And yeah,
[4956.34 → 4957.22] thinking of James 5,
[4957.34 → 4958.80] therefore confess your sins
[4958.80 → 4959.38] to one another
[4959.38 → 4960.32] and pray for each other
[4960.32 → 4961.24] so that you may be healed.
[4961.56 → 4961.84] And the prayer
[4961.84 → 4962.62] of the righteous person
[4962.62 → 4963.64] is powerful and effective.
[4963.64 → 4966.84] So we're going to break up
[4966.84 → 4967.64] into little groups now
[4967.64 → 4968.40] and I want you to confess
[4968.40 → 4969.46] your deepest, darkest sin
[4969.46 → 4970.62] to the person next to you.
[4972.22 → 4973.14] How many are in?
[4973.72 → 4973.88] Yeah.
[4974.62 → 4974.84] Right?
[4975.82 → 4976.42] But somebody.
[4978.72 → 4979.12] Somebody.
[4982.40 → 4983.90] Hiding is one of the signs
[4983.90 → 4985.02] of really unhealthiness.
[4988.42 → 4989.74] And I might add this too
[4989.74 → 4990.36] to that verse.
[4990.72 → 4992.34] Confess the pain of sin
[4992.34 → 4992.80] to another
[4992.80 → 4993.68] that you may be healed.
[4993.80 → 4994.70] Sometimes there's that.
[4994.94 → 4996.54] Know the pain you cause
[4996.54 → 4997.80] and share the pain
[4997.80 → 4998.64] you've received.
[4999.24 → 5000.30] This is part of the process
[5000.30 → 5001.20] of healing forgiveness.
[5001.82 → 5003.06] And I do want to encourage you
[5003.06 → 5003.88] to practice that.
[5003.96 → 5004.92] Maybe sometime this week
[5004.92 → 5005.58] or the next couple of weeks,
[5005.64 → 5006.20] sometime this summer.
[5006.64 → 5008.36] Maybe with some trusted other,
[5008.80 → 5011.04] reflect and say it out loud
[5011.04 → 5012.82] on how you've been forgiven
[5012.82 → 5013.70] by God.
[5015.04 → 5015.70] Share that.
[5016.42 → 5017.22] Share that with somebody.
[5018.66 → 5019.42] Get specific
[5019.42 → 5021.90] so that you can,
[5022.42 → 5023.74] so that we can be moved
[5023.74 → 5025.44] to not self-loathing,
[5025.86 → 5027.20] but to love much.
[5027.92 → 5029.52] Because I know that cycle too.
[5030.34 → 5031.54] I'm just a piece of garbage.
[5031.76 → 5033.36] I keep doing the same things
[5033.36 → 5033.92] over and over again.
[5033.96 → 5034.88] I'm just useless.
[5035.06 → 5036.28] You may as well just give up on me.
[5036.38 → 5037.16] You know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[5037.28 → 5037.42] Right?
[5037.88 → 5038.86] No, this is about learning
[5038.86 → 5039.48] to love much.
[5040.32 → 5041.22] And out of that love,
[5041.28 → 5042.48] we learn to forgive like Christ.
[5042.48 → 5045.36] Forgiveness is hard.
[5046.60 → 5047.82] It makes us feel vulnerable.
[5049.92 → 5051.90] When I hurt my wife's heart,
[5052.86 → 5055.84] I don't like to dwell on that.
[5055.90 → 5057.24] I like to move on a little faster.
[5057.50 → 5058.82] Because I don't want to be that guy.
[5059.96 → 5061.46] But I need to own that pain
[5061.46 → 5062.58] that I've caused.
[5063.06 → 5064.32] Confess that to my God
[5064.32 → 5065.78] and to my wife.
[5066.34 → 5067.82] And trust that God is at work
[5067.82 → 5068.98] in this path of forgiveness
[5068.98 → 5070.20] to heal me
[5070.20 → 5072.14] and those I've harmed.
[5072.48 → 5078.06] Where are you,
[5078.50 → 5079.44] where are those places
[5079.44 → 5081.60] where you need to confess first to God
[5081.60 → 5083.56] and then to someone you've hurt?
[5083.70 → 5085.44] Maybe even somewhat unintentionally.
[5086.90 → 5087.12] Right?
[5087.28 → 5089.16] And I think AA's got it right.
[5090.24 → 5090.46] Right?
[5090.50 → 5091.68] When you do the 12 steps,
[5091.76 → 5092.50] I don't know how many of you
[5092.50 → 5094.26] are aware of the 12 steps,
[5094.38 → 5095.42] but they do it right.
[5095.54 → 5095.64] Right?
[5095.70 → 5096.40] You know, first,
[5096.88 → 5097.70] hi, I'm Sid.
[5097.72 → 5098.40] I'm an alcoholic.
[5098.62 → 5098.76] Right?
[5098.76 → 5099.76] You know, we're right away,
[5099.92 → 5101.66] we're right away on common ground.
[5102.48 → 5104.68] And fearless moral inventory.
[5105.82 → 5108.26] I'm going to name all my stuff.
[5108.48 → 5110.40] And you do that fearless moral inventory
[5110.40 → 5111.96] and then you share it
[5111.96 → 5112.94] with somebody you trust.
[5113.92 → 5114.72] And I've got to hear
[5114.72 → 5116.66] several fearless moral inventories.
[5116.66 → 5118.28] and then,
[5118.88 → 5119.78] eventually that step
[5119.78 → 5121.38] of making amends.
[5123.38 → 5124.90] You don't just confess it.
[5125.00 → 5125.12] You know,
[5125.18 → 5126.50] now go back to all the people
[5126.50 → 5127.90] you've harmed as much as possible
[5127.90 → 5129.00] and you try to make things right.
[5130.10 → 5130.24] Whew.
[5132.24 → 5132.84] 12 steps.
[5132.84 → 5137.54] Yeah, and it doesn't always
[5137.54 → 5138.82] get cleaned up nice and tidy,
[5138.90 → 5139.26] does it?
[5140.64 → 5141.88] Dan Hollander described it
[5141.88 → 5142.88] as being a lifelong thing.
[5143.22 → 5143.86] And she said this,
[5143.98 → 5144.94] this side of heaven,
[5145.06 → 5146.32] we don't get complete restoration.
[5147.12 → 5148.60] I never got a nice,
[5148.76 → 5149.96] clean confession from my dad
[5149.96 → 5150.86] about the hurt he caused.
[5150.86 → 5153.74] But God brought me some healing
[5153.74 → 5154.56] anyway over time
[5154.56 → 5155.46] with lots of counselling
[5155.46 → 5156.06] and praying
[5156.06 → 5157.14] and reading and reflecting
[5157.14 → 5157.98] and sharing with friends.
[5158.64 → 5160.10] And more healing to come,
[5160.14 → 5161.20] I'm convinced of that.
[5162.12 → 5163.02] Because I've experienced
[5163.02 → 5163.70] the power of forgiveness
[5163.70 → 5164.50] in my own life.
[5165.18 → 5166.10] My holy God
[5166.10 → 5167.24] gave His only Son
[5167.24 → 5168.32] so I could receive
[5168.32 → 5169.20] His forgiveness,
[5169.62 → 5170.20] His love,
[5170.42 → 5171.86] forgiveness I deeply need
[5171.86 → 5173.12] and continue to need.
[5173.12 → 5173.94] And in that,
[5174.06 → 5174.68] I've learned to take
[5174.68 → 5175.98] deep, deep hurts
[5175.98 → 5177.20] and forgive them
[5177.20 → 5178.54] because I need to follow
[5178.54 → 5180.72] Jesus and His great love.
[5182.70 → 5184.52] Let me conclude with a story,
[5185.38 → 5186.30] one that expresses
[5186.30 → 5187.02] the power of forgiveness
[5187.02 → 5187.60] in community.
[5188.62 → 5189.40] There was an event
[5189.40 → 5190.40] called the Awakening
[5190.40 → 5191.92] at Göttingen, Germany.
[5192.10 → 5193.98] It was on New Year's Eve, 1843.
[5195.34 → 5196.58] There was a young man
[5196.58 → 5197.28] and he was known
[5197.28 → 5198.58] for wild living
[5198.58 → 5200.20] and a violent temper.
[5200.66 → 5201.18] And one day,
[5201.22 → 5202.16] he came to the door
[5202.16 → 5202.90] of his pastor
[5202.90 → 5205.20] Pastor Christoph Blum hart.
[5206.40 → 5207.86] He came in desperation
[5207.86 → 5209.16] to confess his sins
[5209.16 → 5209.98] to the pastor.
[5210.56 → 5211.40] This isn't a Catholic
[5211.40 → 5212.06] confessional thing,
[5212.10 → 5213.36] this was a Protestant thing.
[5213.72 → 5214.60] And this created
[5214.60 → 5216.36] an unprecedented wave
[5216.36 → 5216.98] of confession
[5216.98 → 5218.02] in the community
[5218.02 → 5219.44] where one remorseful
[5219.44 → 5220.50] villager after another
[5220.50 → 5221.92] came to reveal
[5221.92 → 5222.88] and confess
[5222.88 → 5224.58] sins and reconcile.
[5225.06 → 5225.98] Pierced to the heart,
[5226.32 → 5227.28] people from all walks
[5227.28 → 5228.22] of life felt compelled
[5228.22 → 5228.74] from within
[5228.74 → 5229.66] to break out
[5229.66 → 5230.62] of their old ways.
[5231.00 → 5231.74] Stolen goods
[5231.74 → 5232.50] were returned
[5232.50 → 5234.08] enemies reconciled,
[5234.34 → 5235.28] marriages healed,
[5235.64 → 5236.70] crimes confessed,
[5237.10 → 5238.24] grudges let go.
[5240.24 → 5240.84] Imagine.
[5245.00 → 5245.96] Jesus offered
[5245.96 → 5246.58] his followers
[5246.58 → 5247.76] the keys of the kingdom.
[5249.50 → 5250.40] I picture forgiveness
[5250.40 → 5251.46] as one of the keys, right?
[5251.62 → 5252.92] We hold the key
[5252.92 → 5253.42] of forgiveness
[5253.42 → 5254.14] in our hands
[5254.14 → 5255.66] and now we must choose
[5255.66 → 5257.22] whether to use it or not.
[5257.22 → 5260.06] Christ wants to use
[5260.06 → 5260.78] our hands,
[5261.50 → 5262.88] wounded as they may be,
[5263.72 → 5264.44] to extend
[5264.44 → 5265.18] his forgiveness
[5265.18 → 5266.18] and his grace
[5266.18 → 5267.32] to the world
[5267.32 → 5268.30] and to those around us.
[5270.34 → 5271.14] What will you do
[5271.14 → 5271.52] with the key?
[5273.44 → 5274.04] Let's pray.
[5277.90 → 5278.56] Father God,
[5278.62 → 5279.42] we come before you
[5279.42 → 5280.14] and Lord,
[5280.22 → 5280.96] we just thank you
[5280.96 → 5284.04] for forgiving us.
[5284.04 → 5288.00] Lord,
[5288.04 → 5288.70] I pray that everyone
[5288.70 → 5289.44] here may have
[5289.44 → 5290.72] a profound sense
[5290.72 → 5291.78] of their own brokenness,
[5292.24 → 5293.90] not to beat themselves up
[5293.90 → 5295.06] but to find the freedom
[5295.06 → 5295.92] that is only found
[5295.92 → 5296.80] in deep repentance
[5296.80 → 5297.72] and deep grace
[5297.72 → 5299.48] through deep forgiveness.
[5301.42 → 5301.64] Lord,
[5301.68 → 5302.30] I pray for those
[5302.30 → 5303.04] who have been harmed
[5303.04 → 5305.76] and need to forgive
[5305.76 → 5306.42] someone who
[5306.42 → 5308.24] needs to be held
[5308.24 → 5308.70] accountable,
[5309.70 → 5310.02] of course,
[5310.12 → 5311.10] but also forgiven.
[5311.10 → 5314.24] And I pray,
[5314.40 → 5314.48] Lord,
[5314.56 → 5315.16] that we will humble
[5315.16 → 5315.72] ourselves,
[5318.02 → 5318.98] that we will get honest,
[5320.90 → 5322.48] humble and grace-filled
[5322.48 → 5323.68] people who know
[5323.68 → 5324.86] how to receive forgiveness
[5324.86 → 5326.30] and out of receiving
[5326.30 → 5327.02] that forgiveness
[5327.02 → 5328.70] know how to love well
[5328.70 → 5331.04] so that we can be
[5331.04 → 5331.38] like you,
[5331.46 → 5331.64] Jesus.
[5333.32 → 5334.38] Lead us in all that

[5438.52 → 5450.52] The cross has spoken, I am forgiven. The King of kings calls me His own.
