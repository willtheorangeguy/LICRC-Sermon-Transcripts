[950.76 → 956.02] I missed the bulletin because I had a crazy week and missed it completely
[956.02 → 959.52] But I meant to put in there that on July the 28th

[1095.80 → 1098.76] With the harp and the sound of singing
[1098.76 → 1102.38] With trumpet and the blast of ram's horn
[1102.38 → 1105.44] Shout for joy before the Lord, the King
[1105.44 → 1108.18] Let us join our voices in celebration

[1477.42 → 1479.42] you
[1486.70 → 1487.74] invite you to be seated
[1487.74 → 1493.74] you
[1495.82 → 1498.22] Matthew 12 34 to 36 says
[1499.02 → 1505.82] for the mouth speaks what the heart is full of a good man brings good things out of the good stored
[1505.82 → 1511.10] in up in him and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him
[1512.14 → 1516.30] I don't know about you but I think we like to think of ourselves as being good
[1517.10 → 1523.58] the problem is I find that when I forget to rest in the lord or when I pick up burdens that I thought
[1523.58 → 1524.62] I've left at the cross
[1527.82 → 1529.50] my heart gets full of the wrong things
[1530.54 → 1533.34] if you're like me, you can hear it by what you're thinking
[1534.38 → 1537.82] but you can also hear it by what comes out of your mouth, and it's
[1539.02 → 1540.30] not all that good
[1541.02 → 1543.34] but the Holy Spirit calls us back reminding us
[1543.34 → 1545.66] of Jesus words in
[1546.38 → 1548.94] Matthew 11 28 to 30
[1550.62 → 1555.66] there it says come to me all you who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest
[1556.62 → 1560.94] take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I am gentle and humble in heart
[1561.66 → 1566.78] and you will find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light
[1567.42 → 1572.94] and that's where I find my answer so let's ask Jesus to give us a heart like his
[1573.34 → 1575.42] a gentle and humble heart let's bow
[1579.90 → 1587.34] abba father forgive us once again for trying to live life on our own and not resting in you
[1590.06 → 1598.70] open our eyes to your gentle humble heart and help us to learn from you learn that your yoke is easy
[1598.70 → 1605.02] and your burden is light and that our souls can trust and rest in you
[1606.38 → 1613.58] with the help of your Holy Spirit may our mouths speak your love from an overflowing heart amen
[1613.58 → 1627.58] why don't we stand and continue worship

[2115.58 → 2127.42] invite you to be seated
[2129.42 → 2131.42] thank you
[2134.46 → 2135.02] good morning
[2137.10 → 2143.50] this morning our offering is for the budget and also for the Langley food bank as you can see
[2145.58 → 2151.58] most of us know we're aware of we've supported the Langley food bank for years and years through
[2151.58 → 2157.34] different ways whether you're a student at school whether it's in the community through our church
[2157.34 → 2157.66] here
[2157.66 → 2161.74] um lots of different ways and the Langley food bank really appreciates it
[2161.74 → 2166.78] um I just want to read to you something that was on that is on their website
[2166.78 → 2175.74] um it says the Langley food bank we believe that god has a special concern for those who cannot care for their own needs
[2175.74 → 2181.74] he clearly calls his people to share his concern and express his compassion to the poor and the needy
[2181.74 → 2190.78] god's heart towards the poor is not one of harshness or judgment but rather one of mercy compassion forgiveness and help
[2190.78 → 2200.78] scripture tells us to aggressively work to rescue the poor from the oppression of poverty through our good works and to administer true justice on their behalf
[2200.78 → 2204.78] which includes showing mercy and compassion
[2205.66 → 2212.78] the Langley food bank is an effective voice in preaching the gospel to the poor through the good works of its volunteers
[2212.78 → 2216.78] because actions often speak louder than words
[2216.78 → 2220.78] actions will often create the pathway for those words to be heard
[2220.78 → 2232.78] god's call to the church is to identify with the poor the weak and the vulnerable and to invest our time energy and money in serving them
[2232.78 → 2240.78] the long-term objective in all that we do the food bank is to effect lasting transformation in the lives of our clients
[2240.78 → 2246.78] to bring them from a life of poverty to a life of productivity and hope
[2246.78 → 2264.78] we recognize the absolute need for the intervention and the work of the Holy Spirit as crucial to this process as well as the vital necessity for a new and living relationship with god the father through Jesus Christ his son
[2264.78 → 2274.78] and I know that when josh from the food bank comes this week to come and pick up um this he will be overwhelmed, and he will be um thankful for that he will be
[2274.78 → 2296.78] um and I think those of you who have contributed um our Durbanville community who came out um and brought things and the opportunity we had yesterday at the festival as well to also engage with some of those from our community so thank you very much
[2296.78 → 2298.78] um

[2520.78 → 2532.66] Good morning again.
[2533.78 → 2536.44] Here to lead you in family prayer this morning.
[2537.08 → 2537.78] Let's pray.
[2539.46 → 2544.04] Our Heavenly Father, we come before you on this beautiful summer Sunday morning
[2544.04 → 2545.56] and acknowledge you are the Creator,
[2546.32 → 2550.10] that you spoke our world into being and that the world speaks out your majesty
[2550.10 → 2553.60] and your power, a world that we often don't understand,
[2553.88 → 2556.58] but we take great comfort in knowing you are in control.
[2557.60 → 2562.60] Lord, you give us the pleasure and experience of the rhythms of life,
[2562.86 → 2565.52] the rising and setting of the sun, the changing seasons,
[2565.52 → 2566.98] each with its own character.
[2567.66 → 2571.36] With summer now before us, we are thankful for the beauty of creation all around us.
[2571.44 → 2574.90] We are thankful for experiencing the flowers in the forest,
[2575.28 → 2579.06] witnessing mountain peaks and oceans and rivers and lakes and streams.
[2579.06 → 2582.92] For many of us, summer is a time of rest and restoration,
[2583.64 → 2585.12] and for that we are very thankful.
[2585.68 → 2588.28] For those travelling, we pray for their safety.
[2589.44 → 2594.06] But Lord, even in summer, help us to continue to see the many needs in our world and communities.
[2595.16 → 2600.26] We think of poverty, homelessness, refugees, political unrest, and our damaged environment.
[2601.34 → 2606.42] Lord, we confess that we are often blind to all that you offer and provide for us.
[2606.42 → 2610.42] We become focused on ourselves and our own perceived needs and desires,
[2610.54 → 2613.58] so we close our eyes to the needs of those around us.
[2614.10 → 2619.86] Needs in our world we live in, needs in our country and our province, as well in our local community.
[2619.86 → 2626.64] We confess that we really have no excuse not to reach out to feed those that are hungry,
[2626.64 → 2631.88] to clothe the poor and visit those in need, and treat them as equals, as they are in your sight.
[2632.28 → 2638.28] Father, forgive us, and use your spirit to prompt and move each of us to do our part.
[2638.74 → 2642.54] We are very thankful for the food drive held yesterday in our community,
[2642.54 → 2646.24] and for those that all helped organize and contribute.
[2649.00 → 2653.78] Thank you, Lord, for reminding us that you are in control and that you are always there.
[2654.90 → 2656.76] Where can we go from your spirit?
[2657.18 → 2658.18] Lord, you are in the heavens.
[2658.70 → 2659.62] You are in the depths.
[2659.90 → 2662.14] You are everywhere, in every corner of our lives,
[2662.18 → 2664.14] and your hand will guide us and hold us fast.
[2664.14 → 2668.58] Lord, we pray for our world, our nation, our communities.
[2668.76 → 2671.18] We bring all leaders who govern before you.
[2671.60 → 2676.86] We pray that you will bless them and guide them in the very difficult job of leadership
[2676.86 → 2680.56] and working towards solutions of the many challenges we face.
[2681.66 → 2685.22] We also continue to bring our needs, concerns, and joys before you.
[2685.56 → 2690.48] We pray for those in our church body who struggle with physical, emotional, or other issues.
[2690.48 → 2692.82] We pray for their strength and comfort.
[2693.84 → 2698.28] We pray for those that have lost family and friends and continue to mourn.
[2698.58 → 2702.20] Lord, comfort them and send them your special measure of your healing grace.
[2703.28 → 2707.70] We pray for Emo Smith, who goes for open-heart surgery this week.
[2707.86 → 2711.14] We pray for a successful surgery and a smooth recovery.
[2711.60 → 2718.76] We pray for peace and strength for Emo and Benita during this time of waiting and preparation.
[2720.48 → 2724.30] We are thankful for the healing Everly Astra has experienced,
[2724.64 → 2728.80] and we pray that all goes well with her upcoming MRI later this month.
[2729.70 → 2732.04] We pray for those who are shut in and lonely.
[2732.44 → 2733.74] We pray you grant them comfort.
[2734.68 → 2738.96] We pray with joy and excitement as we celebrate with the Spoor family.
[2740.24 → 2743.20] Congratulations to Ethan and Paige, who were married yesterday in Ontario.
[2743.84 → 2746.88] And we pray for the Hubert family as they make final preparations
[2746.88 → 2748.96] for Noah and Lauren's wedding next weekend.
[2748.96 → 2756.68] And we also celebrate with Case and Anne-Marie Benjamin as they celebrate their 50th anniversary this month.
[2756.84 → 2760.74] We pray for God's continued faithfulness to them and their family.
[2761.70 → 2765.82] Lord, help us to remember you're always there and that you call us to follow your teachings,
[2765.98 → 2769.20] to live in fellowship and communion with you and with one another.
[2769.62 → 2771.12] And in all things, pray continually.
[2772.16 → 2774.40] Be with Pastor Todd as he leads us this morning.
[2774.40 → 2776.46] We thank you that you have brought him here this morning,
[2776.58 → 2777.92] and we ask you to bless this message.
[2778.70 → 2781.28] We pray all this in the name of Jesus Christ,
[2782.28 → 2783.48] our Son, your Son,
[2784.60 → 2785.38] our Lord and Saviour.
[2785.80 → 2786.02] Amen.
[2786.02 → 2786.12] Amen.
[2786.12 → 2786.16] Amen.

[2786.24 → 2786.30] Amen.
[2786.30 → 2788.30] Amen.

[2834.26 → 2834.28] Amen.
[2834.28 → 2849.28] My name is Todd Stat ham, I'm a Christian reform pastor and a missionary of this church and our classes to the students, staff, and faculty at the University of British Columbia's campus in the Okanagan.
[2849.28 → 2853.28] And I'm going into my seventh year doing this, which is remarkable.
[2853.28 → 2873.28] This is a strategic mission field, and I'm delighted to be part of a church denomination and a church generally that believes that we want a gospel presence on public secular universities in Canada, like UBC Okanagan where I work.
[2873.28 → 2876.28] So thank you for making all this possible.
[2876.28 → 2884.28] You support my work through your classical ministry shares, also through taking secondary offerings, and I'm very grateful for it.
[2884.28 → 2896.28] And I'm not here to talk about my work this morning because it's not really the point I'm here just to preach, but it is just a chance for me to say thank you for this really valuable, I believe very valuable work.
[2896.28 → 2924.28] I spend most of my time drinking coffee with students and professors, which doesn't sound like a job, but it is a job, and it's an important one because it gives me the chance to share faith and to deepen faith and to challenge faith across a wide spectrum of people from committed Christians who want to go deeper to students who've left the faith, the students who are not religious at all, but are curious and want to have a conversation.
[2924.28 → 2930.28] And as you can imagine the secular university campus is full of opportunities, it's also full of great challenges.
[2930.28 → 2932.28] So I'll cover your prayers as well.
[2932.28 → 2937.28] A couple of things I just wanted to draw your attention to that I'm, oh, thank you.
[2937.28 → 2940.28] It's very good service.
[2940.28 → 2946.28] A couple of things to draw your attention to that I'm really excited about just to share.
[2946.28 → 2955.28] So this last year for the very first time we were able to expand the campus ministry to the local community college in Kelowna.
[2955.28 → 2959.28] Okanagan College is the largest community college in BC's interior.
[2959.28 → 2969.28] And Curtis Malta who for many years was a youth pastor at Willoughby CRC, is now living in the Okanagan studying to be a pastor in the Christian reform church.
[2969.28 → 2979.28] Works for me one day a week at Okanagan college, and it's just exciting because of, really because of the financial support of congregations like yours we're able to employ Curtis.
[2979.28 → 2989.28] And for the very first time Okanagan college has had a Christian Bible study meeting weekly under Curtis's auspices, which is wonderful.
[2989.28 → 2994.28] Second thing, really excited about, also, please keep me in prayer.
[2994.28 → 3010.28] For the last two years I've been able to teach a UBC course on the Bible, which took, believe me, it took me many years of advocacy and persistent questioning to get to the point where I was able to teach an actual UBC course.
[3010.28 → 3015.28] Lots of opposition to the idea that a Christian pastor would be teaching a UBC course.
[3015.28 → 3020.28] This is a course in the English department, the Bible and literature, but really what it is, is kind of adult Sunday school.
[3020.28 → 3031.28] I'm teaching 35 unchurched students Bible stories so that they can understand the poems and the novels that they're reading, which draw on lots of biblical themes.
[3031.28 → 3038.28] God is opening up lots of opportunities in campus ministry at UBC, and I'm happy, I'm just delighted in what he's doing.
[3038.28 → 3042.28] But at the same time, it's a challenge and I need your prayers.
[3042.28 → 3048.28] We've had a big pro-Palestinian encampment going on all summer, just raises the tension level on campus.
[3048.28 → 3057.28] I'm going to be around after the service, so if you're interested in talking to me about what I do, how you can support it, if you're just curious, what does my day look like, come and talk to me.
[3057.28 → 3068.28] All right, I'll be having a coffee and happy to chat.
[3068.28 → 3073.28] God's word for this morning comes from the book of Acts.
[3073.28 → 3078.28] I'm reading Acts chapter 8.
[3078.28 → 3086.28] Starting in verse 26 to the end of the chapter, this is the story of Philip and the Ethiopian.
[3086.28 → 3093.28] Hear God's word, what the Spirit has to say to Emmanuel Christian Reformed Church this morning.
[3093.28 → 3103.28] Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, go south to the road, the desert road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.
[3103.28 → 3114.28] So he started out and on his way, he met an Ethiopian eunuch, an important official in charge of all the treasury of Mandate, Queen of the Ethiopians.
[3114.28 → 3122.28] This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship and on his way home was sitting in his chariot, reading the book of Isaiah the prophet.
[3122.28 → 3128.28] The spirit told Philip, go to that chariot and stay near it.
[3128.28 → 3133.28] Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading the prophet Isaiah.
[3133.28 → 3136.28] Do you understand what you're reading? Philip asked.
[3136.28 → 3140.28] How can I? He said, unless someone explains it to me.
[3140.28 → 3144.28] So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
[3144.28 → 3148.28] The eunuch was reading this passage of scripture.
[3148.28 → 3150.28] This is from Isaiah 53.
[3150.28 → 3157.28] He was led like a sheep to the slaughter and as a lamb before the shearer is silent, so he did not open his mouth.
[3157.28 → 3161.28] In his humiliation, he was deprived of justice.
[3161.28 → 3166.28] Who can speak of his descendants? For his life was taken away from the earth.
[3166.28 → 3175.28] The eunuch asked Philip, tell me please, who is the prophet talking about himself or someone else?
[3175.28 → 3182.28] Then Philip began with that very passage of scripture, and he told him the good news of Jesus.
[3182.28 → 3187.28] As they travelled together along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, look, here's water.
[3187.28 → 3192.28] Why shouldn't I be baptized? And he gave orders to stop the chariot.
[3192.28 → 3198.28] Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him.
[3198.28 → 3204.28] When they came up out of the water, the spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away and the eunuch did not see him again.
[3204.28 → 3206.28] But he went on his way rejoicing.
[3206.28 → 3215.28] Philip, however, appeared at Lotus and travelled about preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea.
[3215.28 → 3222.28] Amen. May God add his blessing to the reading and to the proclamation of his word.
[3222.28 → 3230.28] Are you familiar with this story from Acts 8? Have you heard it before?
[3230.28 → 3235.28] It's lots of people nodding. It's a familiar story, I think.
[3235.28 → 3238.28] This is one of my favourite stories in the New Testament.
[3238.28 → 3241.28] Really, one of my all-time favourite stories.
[3241.28 → 3249.28] It shows the early church, the first Christians, after Pentecost, after the spirit is poured down on the church,
[3249.28 → 3256.28] reaching out to people of different races and places with the good news of Jesus Christ.
[3256.28 → 3265.28] It's like the gospel is kind of radiating from this epicentre that is Jerusalem to new countries, new places.
[3265.28 → 3275.28] The church is sharing with others its faith in the great thing that God has done in Jesus Christ for us and for our salvation.
[3275.28 → 3282.28] And here we have in this story the very first black African becoming a follower of Jesus.
[3282.28 → 3289.28] I worked as a missionary for four years in Central Africa with the Presbyterian Church and taught at the seminary there.
[3289.28 → 3294.28] One of my research fields is the history of Christianity in Africa.
[3294.28 → 3299.28] And when I started my lectures on the history of the church in Africa, I'd start with this story.
[3299.28 → 3305.28] Acts chapter 8, the first black African becoming a follower of Jesus.
[3305.28 → 3310.28] He's a powerful bureaucrat. We would think of him as a diplomat.
[3310.28 → 3320.28] From this land that the Bible calls Ethiopia or Nubian, the modern country of Ethiopia takes its name from him, not the other way around.
[3320.28 → 3322.28] He is Nubian. He's a black African.
[3322.28 → 3330.28] And he works in the service of the powerful Nubian queen, the Mandate or the Candace.
[3330.28 → 3337.28] And in conversation with Philip, he hears for the first time that God's son, Jesus, died and was resurrected,
[3337.28 → 3345.28] not just for Jews, but for all people, including an African like him or a European like me.
[3345.28 → 3349.28] And then he's baptized as a follower of Jesus.
[3349.28 → 3362.28] A great story to remind the church here and now that we have a mission in the power of the Spirit to share the good news of what God has done in Jesus Christ for the salvation of the world.
[3362.28 → 3366.28] This is a story that sets the tone for us today.
[3366.28 → 3368.28] The Apostle Paul says,
[3368.28 → 3384.28] When we gather as a church, what we're doing right now, God is making his appeal to the world through us.
[3384.28 → 3396.28] When we go out as a church into the world, giving food to the food bank, going into our schools, our works, our jobs, our homes, doing the just and the true and the beautiful,
[3396.28 → 3399.28] God is making his appeal to the world through us.
[3399.28 → 3401.28] We are his ambassadors.
[3401.28 → 3417.28] And of course, when we share our faith, when we talk about our faith in Jesus with other people, sharing a word of encouragement, of faith in Jesus, when we do that, God is making his appeal to the world through us.
[3417.28 → 3419.28] We are Christ's ambassadors.
[3419.28 → 3429.28] That's why it's so important for us to share our faith, to be able to talk to our friends and neighbours about what God has done for us in Jesus.
[3429.28 → 3435.28] I know I just lost about half of you when I said that, that we need to share our faith, right?
[3435.28 → 3437.28] Some of you are already looking out the window.
[3437.28 → 3439.28] You're like, uh-oh.
[3439.28 → 3441.28] Christian Reformed folk are good at lots of things.
[3441.28 → 3446.28] One thing we're not very good at though is talking to other people about our faith.
[3446.28 → 3447.28] Are we?
[3447.28 → 3448.28] Are we?
[3448.28 → 3449.28] Come on.
[3449.28 → 3450.28] We're not.
[3450.28 → 3452.28] We're not.
[3452.28 → 3458.28] For a long time, the Christian Reformed Church thought we could grow our churches by making lots of babies.
[3458.28 → 3462.28] And it works, but it can't be sustained forever.
[3462.28 → 3468.28] And it doesn't answer this key question, is God making his appeal to the world through us?
[3468.28 → 3471.28] Are we Christ's ambassadors?
[3471.28 → 3476.28] Christian Reformed folk get uncomfortable with the idea of sharing faith.
[3476.28 → 3477.28] I get it.
[3477.28 → 3480.28] Some of you right now are thinking, I'm not that kind of person.
[3480.28 → 3481.28] I'm not that kind of person.
[3481.28 → 3482.28] Some of you are cynical.
[3482.28 → 3485.28] And you're thinking, I don't need to share my faith.
[3485.28 → 3488.28] That's what we pay our pastors to do, right?
[3488.28 → 3490.28] You are so cynical.
[3490.28 → 3492.28] But you're thinking it.
[3492.28 → 3494.28] Most of you are just afraid.
[3494.28 → 3497.28] You're thinking, I don't feel comfortable.
[3497.28 → 3499.28] I feel awkward doing that.
[3499.28 → 3503.28] What if someone asks me a question and I don't know the answer, right?
[3503.28 → 3510.28] You're thinking, I don't have a graduate degree in theology like Pastor Chris does or Pastor Kevin or me, right?
[3510.28 → 3514.28] Listen, I'm on your side, okay?
[3514.28 → 3516.28] I know all these objections.
[3516.28 → 3518.28] I say them often in my own head.
[3518.28 → 3522.28] I am like an off-the-chart introvert, right?
[3522.28 → 3526.28] I don't like talking to people generally unless I have to.
[3526.28 → 3533.28] And yet God has called me into a job where really about 60% of the time that's what I'm doing.
[3533.28 → 3537.28] I'm sitting down talking about faith with people.
[3537.28 → 3542.28] And I'm more and more convinced that we as a Christian Reformed Church, as a denomination,
[3542.28 → 3547.28] we really need to take seriously this call to share faith.
[3547.28 → 3551.28] This is the post-Christian world that we live in, right?
[3551.28 → 3553.28] Lots of people have left faith.
[3553.28 → 3555.28] Lots of people are no longer interested in faith.
[3555.28 → 3558.28] After COVID, lots of people left the church.
[3558.28 → 3564.28] We need to address these people, those who've left the church, those who never joined in the first place,
[3564.28 → 3568.28] and share with them what God has done in Jesus Christ.
[3568.28 → 3570.28] But this question is how?
[3570.28 → 3571.28] How do we do that?
[3571.28 → 3573.28] It's fine for me to say this from the pulpit.
[3573.28 → 3575.28] You start to feel guilty about it.
[3575.28 → 3576.28] That's not what I want to do.
[3576.28 → 3578.28] How do we do this?
[3578.28 → 3582.28] How do we go about just talking to people about Jesus?
[3582.28 → 3587.28] I'm not very good at this.
[3587.28 → 3589.28] I'm not, because I'm an introvert.
[3589.28 → 3596.28] But one thing that God has done over my career as a campus pastor is kind of teach me how to do it.
[3596.28 → 3604.28] And one place that I've learned from, I've learned how to do this from, is this story from Acts chapter 8.
[3604.28 → 3613.28] This story is a wonderful story to prime us a little bit about how we actually go about having conversations with others about Jesus Christ.
[3613.28 → 3619.28] So I want to pass on a couple of the things I've learned from this story to you.
[3619.28 → 3620.28] Okay?
[3620.28 → 3628.28] Now the very first thing I learned from this story, it's that sharing our faith definitely takes us out of our comfort zone.
[3628.28 → 3631.28] And it's okay to admit this.
[3631.28 → 3633.28] It's just okay to admit it.
[3633.28 → 3639.28] You don't have to feel bad like you're a bad Christian if you don't feel comfortable talking to others about Jesus.
[3639.28 → 3641.28] And we know this from the story.
[3641.28 → 3643.28] It's embedded in the story.
[3643.28 → 3644.28] Let me show you how.
[3644.28 → 3655.28] So, Philip is called by God to go out of the city where he had been working into the desert and the wilderness.
[3655.28 → 3659.28] Now, if you've been reading your Bible your whole life, like many of you had,
[3659.28 → 3664.28] any time you hear the word wilderness or desert, you should set off a little bell in your ear.
[3664.28 → 3667.28] Like, ding! Important word.
[3667.28 → 3672.28] The phrase, go to the south, also means go at noon.
[3672.28 → 3674.28] Some translations will translate it that way.
[3674.28 → 3680.28] Because back then people used to use the sun to tell time and to give direction, right?
[3680.28 → 3685.28] So the story says, go at noon into the desert.
[3685.28 → 3690.28] What do you know about the Middle Eastern desert at noon?
[3690.28 → 3692.28] It's hot.
[3692.28 → 3696.28] It's hotter than Kelowna, which was 39 degrees yesterday.
[3696.28 → 3699.28] It is hot and uncomfortable.
[3699.28 → 3701.28] It is not the place you want to be.
[3701.28 → 3707.28] In fact, you avoid travelling in the desert and especially the desert in the middle of the day.
[3707.28 → 3714.28] And the point the story is making is that Philip is being moved out of his comfort zone
[3714.28 → 3719.28] into a place of profound discomfort in order to share faith.
[3719.28 → 3722.28] That's it.
[3722.28 → 3729.28] The Spirit of God moves people out of our comfort zone into places where we share faith.
[3729.28 → 3737.28] Now, I find it gives me a lot of comfort, a lot of encouragement actually, as an introvert,
[3737.28 → 3744.28] to simply admit from Scripture that sharing faith with others, talking to Jesus,
[3744.28 → 3751.28] talking about Jesus with others, isn't the most comfortable thing to do for most of us.
[3751.28 → 3761.28] Even an apostle, Philip, is called out of his comfort zone into an uncomfortable place in order to share faith.
[3761.28 → 3764.28] So I take heart from that, and you should too.
[3764.28 → 3768.28] You're not a bad Christian if this makes you feel awkward.
[3768.28 → 3771.28] You're just like an apostle, right?
[3771.28 → 3772.28] Think of yourself that way.
[3772.28 → 3774.28] We're just like apostles.
[3774.28 → 3776.28] Take heart.
[3776.28 → 3778.28] And this is my second point.
[3778.28 → 3787.28] God calls us into these uncomfortable conversations where we have this opportunity to share Jesus with others.
[3787.28 → 3789.28] These don't just happen.
[3789.28 → 3792.28] God calls us to them.
[3792.28 → 3794.28] He's in the conversation.
[3794.28 → 3795.28] He's there before it.
[3795.28 → 3797.28] He's there through it.
[3797.28 → 3799.28] And he is there after it.
[3799.28 → 3803.28] And this not only comforts us, it should give us some confidence.
[3803.28 → 3808.28] Yeah, sharing our faith with friends and coworkers, school classmates, whatever.
[3808.28 → 3810.28] That pushes us out of our comfort zone.
[3810.28 → 3811.28] But God is there.
[3811.28 → 3813.28] He's in it all through and through.
[3813.28 → 3815.28] And this is clear from our story too.
[3815.28 → 3820.28] When we pay attention to whom the main character of this story is.
[3820.28 → 3825.28] And when I say main character, I don't mean Philip, and I don't mean the Ethiopian.
[3825.28 → 3829.28] The main character is God.
[3829.28 → 3833.28] From start to finish, the story is about God.
[3833.28 → 3835.28] The story begins with him, right?
[3835.28 → 3840.28] In verse 26, the angel of the Lord says to Philip, go and rise.
[3840.28 → 3846.28] And long before Philip even showed up, the Holy Spirit was at work in this Ethiopian eunuch's heart.
[3846.28 → 3848.28] I mean, think of this, he's half a world away.
[3848.28 → 3855.28] He's half a world away from his home in Jerusalem to worship God.
[3855.28 → 3857.28] He's seeking.
[3857.28 → 3859.28] The spirit is at work in him.
[3859.28 → 3864.28] Why else would someone be reading the Bible on a bumpy chariot?
[3864.28 → 3867.28] This is not an ideal place to read.
[3867.28 → 3868.28] He's hungry.
[3868.28 → 3871.28] God is in this conversation.
[3871.28 → 3875.28] And this conversation then happens through the spirit.
[3875.28 → 3880.28] Verse 29, the spirit says to Philip, go over and join this chariot.
[3880.28 → 3884.28] And of course, the story ends with God at the very end of the chapter.
[3884.28 → 3889.28] They come up out of the water and the spirit of God carries Philip away.
[3889.28 → 3893.28] The eunuch goes on his way, rejoicing.
[3893.28 → 3900.28] From first to last, God is through and through this conversation.
[3900.28 → 3901.28] God builds this church.
[3901.28 → 3906.28] God makes his appeal through us.
[3906.28 → 3908.28] We can trust in this God and have confidence.
[3908.28 → 3914.28] I mean, imagine you're in Costco and you run into your friend and your friend's not a believer.
[3914.28 → 3916.28] And she tells you that she's struggling.
[3916.28 → 3918.28] You want to say something hopeful.
[3918.28 → 3923.28] You want to share with her how your faith in Jesus got you through a really hard time in life.
[3923.28 → 3927.28] Or you've said a prayer and God has answered it.
[3927.28 → 3932.28] Or maybe you just want to add the words, I'm going to pray for you on to the end of your sentence.
[3932.28 → 3934.28] But what do you do if you're like me?
[3934.28 → 3936.28] You don't say anything, right?
[3936.28 → 3937.28] You just balk.
[3937.28 → 3938.28] It's awkward.
[3938.28 → 3940.28] We're in public.
[3940.28 → 3942.28] But God is in this conversation.
[3942.28 → 3948.28] His providence has brought us together at this point and for this purpose.
[3948.28 → 3954.28] He is going to use whatever comes out of your mouth for her good, for her blessing.
[3954.28 → 3956.28] That's what God does.
[3956.28 → 3959.28] His providence is through all of our conversations.
[3959.28 → 3961.28] And we can take confidence in this.
[3961.28 → 3962.28] Take heart.
[3962.28 → 3970.28] I don't know how I could handle my job on a secular, often hostile campus, if I wasn't constantly
[3970.28 → 3976.28] reminding myself, like every day when I go to work, reminding myself that like Philip,
[3976.28 → 3985.28] the spirit of the ascended Christ is before, behind, and in front of every conversation I will have.
[3985.28 → 3986.28] That's true.
[3986.28 → 3988.28] And it's true for you as well.
[3988.28 → 3993.28] God makes his appeal through us.
[3993.28 → 3999.28] He prepares us for these encounters and prepares these encounters for us.
[3999.28 → 4003.28] Even if you don't feel it, that's what he's doing.
[4003.28 → 4010.28] What else can we learn from this story, Acts 8, about sharing our faith?
[4010.28 → 4012.28] A lot.
[4012.28 → 4017.28] One more thing, though, I want to just share that I've learned from this story about sharing
[4017.28 → 4018.28] faith.
[4018.28 → 4019.28] And it's this.
[4019.28 → 4022.28] It's the power of questions.
[4022.28 → 4028.28] Questions are the keys to great conversations.
[4028.28 → 4029.28] Genuine conversation.
[4029.28 → 4030.28] Genuine conversation.
[4030.28 → 4033.28] Conversation in which we can share our faith in Jesus with others.
[4033.28 → 4040.28] If I were to poll you as a congregation right now and say, what prevents you from talking
[4040.28 → 4042.28] about Jesus with your neighbours or your friends?
[4042.28 → 4047.28] Most of you would probably say, I'm afraid to.
[4047.28 → 4051.28] I'm anxious that someone, that I don't know what to say, right?
[4051.28 → 4053.28] I don't have the right answer.
[4053.28 → 4054.28] That's pretty typical.
[4054.28 → 4066.28] The thing is, in sharing faith, having the right question is often more important than
[4066.28 → 4069.28] having the right answer.
[4069.28 → 4074.28] Having the right question is more important than having the right answer.
[4074.28 → 4076.28] We know this from the story.
[4076.28 → 4078.28] This is what I've really taken away from this story.
[4078.28 → 4080.28] And I'm going to slow it down.
[4080.28 → 4085.28] We're going to go slow motion here, frame by frame.
[4085.28 → 4090.28] First, Philip listens to the Ethiopian.
[4090.28 → 4092.28] Did you notice that?
[4092.28 → 4094.28] Philip's called to go speak with the Ethiopian.
[4094.28 → 4096.28] We think, oh, he's got a message.
[4096.28 → 4099.28] He doesn't speak first though.
[4099.28 → 4101.28] Philip listens.
[4101.28 → 4107.28] He listens to the Ethiopian reading out loud.
[4107.28 → 4109.28] Then Philip preaches.
[4109.28 → 4110.28] No, he doesn't.
[4110.28 → 4114.28] Then Philip asks a question.
[4114.28 → 4117.28] Do you understand what you're reading?
[4117.28 → 4119.28] That's a pretty simple question, hey?
[4119.28 → 4121.28] You could ask that question.
[4121.28 → 4124.28] I ask that question a lot of students.
[4124.28 → 4129.28] Do you understand what you're reading?
[4129.28 → 4133.28] Then the Ethiopian asks Philip a question.
[4133.28 → 4135.28] How can I?
[4135.28 → 4138.28] Look at all these questions going back and forth.
[4138.28 → 4141.28] This is a real conversation happening.
[4141.28 → 4145.28] Then Philip jumps into the chariot.
[4145.28 → 4147.28] No, he doesn't.
[4147.28 → 4153.28] The Ethiopian invites Philip into his life.
[4153.28 → 4156.28] Come into my chariot.
[4156.28 → 4159.28] Come meet me for a coffee.
[4159.28 → 4161.28] Let's go out for a beer.
[4161.28 → 4163.28] Here's my cell phone number.
[4163.28 → 4164.28] Right?
[4164.28 → 4168.28] This is a relationship that's forming.
[4168.28 → 4173.28] Words are being shared as hearts are being shared.
[4173.28 → 4175.28] We need to slow this story down.
[4175.28 → 4179.28] Take it frame by frame and see what God is teaching us.
[4179.28 → 4187.28] More questions follow after reading the passage of Scripture from Isaiah.
[4187.28 → 4190.28] The Ethiopian eunuch asks Philip to explain it.
[4190.28 → 4193.28] And then he asks Philip to baptize him.
[4193.28 → 4196.28] Philip does not have an agenda.
[4196.28 → 4201.28] He's not pushing a tract at the Ethiopian eunuch.
[4201.28 → 4204.28] He's not ramming answers down his throat.
[4204.28 → 4207.28] He's listening.
[4207.28 → 4209.28] Genuinely listening.
[4209.28 → 4214.28] And then he's responding by asking questions.
[4214.28 → 4222.28] All these questions back and forth are marks of a good conversation about faith.
[4222.28 → 4228.28] Questions are one of the main ways that the Holy Spirit changes people.
[4228.28 → 4240.28] What I mean is that questions, the questions we ask, might be the very same questions that Jesus asked into people's life when he was ministering on earth.
[4240.28 → 4242.28] Words of comfort and challenge.
[4242.28 → 4247.28] God uses questions to comfort people and to challenge them.
[4247.28 → 4249.28] Jesus often asks questions.
[4249.28 → 4251.28] Who do you say I am?
[4251.28 → 4254.28] Why are you so afraid?
[4254.28 → 4258.28] These are questions that invite response.
[4258.28 → 4264.28] Questions that begin conversations about what really matters.
[4264.28 → 4268.28] And the ascended Christ does the same thing through his church now.
[4268.28 → 4275.28] He poses questions to the world, to the people we meet through us, making his appeal that way.
[4275.28 → 4279.28] Questions to broken people, to a broken world.
[4279.28 → 4283.28] Questions that might transform or convert.
[4283.28 → 4288.28] The questions might be as simple as, who do you think Jesus is?
[4288.28 → 4291.28] Would you like me to pray for you?
[4291.28 → 4294.28] How are you really doing?
[4294.28 → 4299.28] I ask questions like this all the time.
[4299.28 → 4302.28] In my work as a campus pastor.
[4302.28 → 4306.28] There's this iconic novel by Jack Kerouac called On the Road.
[4306.28 → 4313.28] It's a great scene where two young men are drifting along the highway travelling, and they bump into this old farmer.
[4313.28 → 4317.28] I always imagine him as a kind of old Dutch CRC farmer.
[4317.28 → 4323.28] And he says to these young men, you guys going somewhere?
[4323.28 → 4325.28] Or are you just going?
[4325.28 → 4327.28] Great question.
[4327.28 → 4330.28] I use a variation of this question all the time with students.
[4330.28 → 4332.28] You guys going somewhere?
[4332.28 → 4333.28] What are you doing?
[4333.28 → 4335.28] What's the point of it all?
[4335.28 → 4336.28] Right?
[4336.28 → 4338.28] This is this great existential question.
[4338.28 → 4340.28] It's not a question that closes conversations down.
[4340.28 → 4344.28] It opens them up so that we can talk about things that really matter.
[4344.28 → 4349.28] Questions invite response.
[4349.28 → 4352.28] They're how God can challenge and comfort people.
[4352.28 → 4356.28] The other thing that questions do when we're sharing faith is they clear away clutter.
[4356.28 → 4359.28] They clear away clutter really fast.
[4359.28 → 4362.28] And this is important at the moment we're in right now culturally.
[4362.28 → 4365.28] We're in this so-called post-Christian world, right?
[4365.28 → 4369.28] Where people are often very hostile to faith.
[4369.28 → 4373.28] But they're hostile to a faith they don't really know anything about.
[4373.28 → 4376.28] Have you noticed this if you ever talk to people about Christianity?
[4376.28 → 4381.28] They think they know what we believe and what we're like, but they really don't.
[4381.28 → 4386.28] And they say all sorts of ludicrous things that they've got from the media about what Christians are like.
[4386.28 → 4389.28] I get this all the time in my work.
[4389.28 → 4393.28] We're not the first generation in history to have to deal with this.
[4393.28 → 4395.28] If you could bring up the next slide.
[4395.28 → 4397.28] I was reading this recently.
[4397.28 → 4402.28] There's a second century Christian philosopher named Justin Martyr.
[4402.28 → 4407.28] And his name is Justin Martyr because around the year 170 he's martyred.
[4407.28 → 4409.28] He's killed for his faith.
[4409.28 → 4413.28] But he's a philosopher who converts to Christianity.
[4413.28 → 4417.28] And at some point in his career he writes what's called an apology.
[4417.28 → 4420.28] Not I'm saying sorry, an apology like a defence.
[4420.28 → 4428.28] He writes a defence of Christianity because as he explains it,
[4428.28 → 4432.28] I propose to him, this is the people who are criticizing Christianity,
[4432.28 → 4439.28] certain questions on this subject and spoke with him and found most convincingly that he in truth knows nothing.
[4439.28 → 4444.28] So he writes this to the Senate of Rome, a defence of Christianity,
[4444.28 → 4449.28] because what he's hearing when he's asking questions of people,
[4449.28 → 4450.28] what do Christians believe?
[4450.28 → 4451.28] What are we like?
[4451.28 → 4453.28] He's hearing all this nonsense.
[4453.28 → 4462.28] And so he's asking questions to declutter the field so that we can share faith properly.
[4462.28 → 4463.28] And I find this so heartening.
[4463.28 → 4465.28] I come across this all the time.
[4465.28 → 4473.28] In September, a young woman texted me from at UBC saying she wanted to meet with me for a coffee.
[4473.28 → 4477.28] And I know this young woman from a local church.
[4477.28 → 4480.28] So we sat down and sort of, what's on your mind?
[4480.28 → 4487.28] And she had just been in a first year anthropology class, like Anthropology 101.
[4487.28 → 4493.28] And the professor was describing religious groups, including Christianity.
[4493.28 → 4496.28] And as soon as I hear this in my head, I'm thinking, oh, no.
[4496.28 → 4503.28] And she says, so my professor says that most Christians are white supremacists.
[4503.28 → 4506.28] This is a fact, right?
[4506.28 → 4508.28] She's like, is this true?
[4508.28 → 4514.28] My question, do you know that the vast majority of Christians in the world aren't white?
[4514.28 → 4516.28] I didn't know that.
[4516.28 → 4519.28] Why don't you ask your professor that?
[4519.28 → 4522.28] Maybe he doesn't know that either.
[4522.28 → 4525.28] Most Christians in the world, the vast majority of Christians in the world are not white.
[4525.28 → 4526.28] Okay?
[4526.28 → 4529.28] So it's kind of hard to put the two together.
[4529.28 → 4530.28] Most Christians in the world are not white.
[4530.28 → 4533.28] And yet, apparently, most Christians are white supremacists.
[4533.28 → 4534.28] No.
[4534.28 → 4544.28] Questions are powerful things for removing the clutter so that we can have real conversations about faith.
[4544.28 → 4547.28] It was true back then in the second century.
[4547.28 → 4556.28] It's just as true today in the 21st century in this secular post-Christian world in which we live.
[4556.28 → 4558.28] This is the last thing I want to say about questions.
[4558.28 → 4560.28] And it's an important one.
[4560.28 → 4573.28] The fact that Philip is asking so many questions of the Ethiopian eunuch shows that he really values the Ethiopian eunuch as an individual person, as a unique person that God has put before him.
[4573.28 → 4587.28] Like, I know, I've heard, I've never experienced this, but I've heard that in some Christian traditions, they encourage people to do evangelism by, you know, knocking on doors and leading with a question like, oh, you know, if you died tonight, would you go to heaven or hell?
[4587.28 → 4588.28] Something like that.
[4588.28 → 4595.28] I don't find that's a very effective way of sharing our faith because it starts with a leading question.
[4595.28 → 4598.28] And it's a stock question.
[4598.28 → 4606.28] I think Philip shows us a much better way of listening, genuinely listening to the unique person that God has put before him.
[4606.28 → 4615.28] And then responding with questions that intersect and engage that person's unique story, their place in life.
[4615.28 → 4617.28] What are you reading?
[4617.28 → 4619.28] Do you understand it?
[4619.28 → 4626.28] These are the kind of questions someone asks who's genuinely listening to what's happening in the life of the person before him.
[4626.28 → 4628.28] I find that so much better.
[4628.28 → 4639.28] Questions, listening and then asking questions shows that we're taking the person before us and their story as a unique story that God wants us to engage with.
[4639.28 → 4645.28] You know, we believe as Christians that Jesus is the answer.
[4645.28 → 4646.28] Absolutely.
[4646.28 → 4659.28] He is the answer to questions that arise from people, all sorts of people in particular seasons of life and moments of life with very different sins and fears, burdens and hurts.
[4659.28 → 4663.28] Let's listen to those stories and then ask questions.
[4663.28 → 4666.28] Questions that show that we care, that we're interested.
[4666.28 → 4672.28] Then we share how God has touched our life in Jesus Christ.
[4672.28 → 4678.28] Then we share with them what God is doing in us, just like Philip did with the eunuch.
[4678.28 → 4687.28] Now, I know it's intimidating to think that we should share our faith with others if we think we have to have all the right answers beforehand.
[4687.28 → 4700.28] But it's not intimidating to think about sharing our faith in Jesus if it means listening carefully and then asking questions as that relationship emerges.
[4700.28 → 4702.28] We can all do that, right?
[4702.28 → 4715.28] Then sharing our faith with our new friend or an old family member about how we've experienced Jesus in the Bible becomes a genuine conversation in which Jesus Christ is shared,
[4715.28 → 4720.28] in which God makes his appeal through us.
[4720.28 → 4725.28] So those are a few things I've learned from this story in my work.
[4725.28 → 4728.28] God has taught me from this story about sharing faith.
[4728.28 → 4734.28] And I'll just close with this little anecdote as a way of making, maybe making everything concrete.
[4734.28 → 4743.28] So one thing I often do, I've done throughout the years, is organized what I call faith conversations.
[4743.28 → 4749.28] And these are conversations between people of different faiths, usually between Christians and Muslims.
[4749.28 → 4752.28] And these are great experiences.
[4752.28 → 4761.28] Our goal is simply to share faith, to explain with others why we believe what we believe and why we do what we do.
[4761.28 → 4764.28] You can see a couple of examples here. One of them was during COVID.
[4764.28 → 4766.28] How do we keep faith during COVID?
[4766.28 → 4770.28] Another one had to do with time, like holy times and holy days and things like that.
[4770.28 → 4777.28] And in these conversations, questions are prominent.
[4777.28 → 4783.28] Why do you do this? Why do you believe that? What does that mean to you?
[4783.28 → 4788.28] And from both sides, going back and forth. Why do Christians do that?
[4788.28 → 4794.28] Questions are important for decluttering the conversation too.
[4794.28 → 4798.28] Muslims think they know what Christians believe.
[4798.28 → 4804.28] Why do you guys worship the Trinity, the Father, Mary and Jesus?
[4804.28 → 4808.28] We don't actually, right? But they think we do.
[4808.28 → 4812.28] Questions are important for clearing the ground.
[4812.28 → 4817.28] And questions are important for building these relationships.
[4817.28 → 4822.28] And the one story that comes to mind is the one that probably happened three years ago.
[4822.28 → 4827.28] And two young women who are Christian joined this conversation.
[4827.28 → 4831.28] And they were very shy. They sat on the edge. They didn't talk very much.
[4831.28 → 4835.28] They would be the first to admit that they didn't know very much about Christianity.
[4835.28 → 4840.28] Although they'd grown up in the church. And they didn't quite know what to say.
[4840.28 → 4849.28] But they asked questions. And because they asked questions, they began to form real relationships with a couple of young Muslims.
[4849.28 → 4858.28] And after this session concluded, the conversation continued on social media.
[4858.28 → 4862.28] They were back and forth by text. Various questions about faith.
[4862.28 → 4866.28] And then finally comes the big question. One of the Muslim students says,
[4866.28 → 4874.28] Can I come to church with you? It's an invitation. Can I be part of your life and faith?
[4874.28 → 4880.28] And so these young women, again, the first to admit they know very little about their own faith.
[4880.28 → 4883.28] Of course you can come to church with us.
[4883.28 → 4891.28] And so for the last, I think, six weeks of that term, this student was, this Muslim student was about to graduate.
[4891.28 → 4895.28] For the last six weeks of that term, the Muslim went to church with these two Christians.
[4895.28 → 4899.28] And listened and asked more questions.
[4899.28 → 4903.28] Now this student has graduated. I don't know what's happened to him.
[4903.28 → 4910.28] But seeds were planted there. And seeds were planted, not because these Christians knew all the answers.
[4910.28 → 4917.28] And were bold to share the faith. But because they were quiet and shy.
[4917.28 → 4925.28] And took the time to listen. And then ask meaningful questions based on the person that God had put in their life before them.
[4925.28 → 4929.28] And I don't know what happened to that Muslim student.
[4929.28 → 4935.28] But my hope and prayer is that he, like the Ethiopian eunuch, will one day go on his way rejoicing,
[4935.28 → 4940.28] having encountered the living God revealed in Jesus Christ.
[4940.28 → 4945.28] So take heart. Have the courage to share our faith.
[4945.28 → 4949.28] You don't have to have all the answers.
[4949.28 → 4953.28] You just need to love people enough to listen to them.
[4953.28 → 4956.28] Ask questions that touch their lives.
[4956.28 → 4963.28] Answers, or questions that touch their lives and questions that point to the answer.
[4963.28 → 4968.28] Jesus Christ, who is much bigger and greater than any of our conversations.
[4968.28 → 4976.28] My hope and prayer for our Reformed churches is that we will become better at sharing faith in this post-Christian world in which we live.
[4976.28 → 4983.28] Because through us, God is making his appeal to this hurting, broken, and sinful world.
[4983.28 → 4991.28] And through us, his Son is being glorified. And his kingdom is being revealed. Amen.
[4991.28 → 4996.28] Invite the worship team to come up for a song of response.
[4996.28 → 5021.28] And we all rise as we sing this great is thy faithfulness.
[5021.28 → 5024.20] we sing this, Great is Thy Faithfulness.
[5051.28 → 5064.80] Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father,
[5064.80 → 5071.80] there is no shadow of turning with Thee.
[5072.58 → 5078.80] Thou changes not, Thy compassions they fail not,
[5078.80 → 5085.80] as Thou hast been, Thou forever wilt be.
[5086.92 → 5092.80] Great is Thy faithfulness, Great is Thy faithfulness,
[5093.96 → 5099.80] morning by morning new mercies I see.
[5100.74 → 5106.52] All I have needed Thy hand has provided,
[5106.52 → 5113.52] Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
[5115.52 → 5121.52] Summer and winter and springtime and harvest,
[5121.52 → 5128.52] Sun, moon and stars in their courses above.
[5128.52 → 5135.52] Join with all nature in manifold witness,
[5135.52 → 5142.52] To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.
[5142.52 → 5149.52] Great is Thy faithfulness, Great is Thy faithfulness,
[5150.52 → 5155.52] Morning by morning new mercies I see.
[5155.52 → 5162.52] All I have needed Thy hand has provided,
[5162.52 → 5169.52] Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
[5169.52 → 5185.52] Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide,
[5185.52 → 5192.52] Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,
[5192.52 → 5199.52] Blessings all mine with ten thousand beside.
[5199.52 → 5202.52] Great is Thy faithfulness, Great is Thy faithfulness,
[5202.52 → 5204.52] Great is Thy faithfulness.
[5204.52 → 5207.52] Great is Thy faithfulness, Great is Thy faithfulness,
[5207.52 → 5213.52] Morning by morning new mercies I see.
[5214.52 → 5219.52] All I have needed Thy hand has provided,
[5220.52 → 5223.52] Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.
[5223.52 → 5227.84] faithfulness Lord unto me.
[5235.04 → 5241.06] As we depart, God blesses his people with these words from 2 Thessalonians.
[5241.20 → 5246.90] Receive God's blessing. May the Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father
[5246.90 → 5252.60] who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope,
[5252.60 → 5260.76] encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good deed and every good word. Amen.
[5260.76 → 5261.76] Amen.
[5290.76 → 5292.76] Amen.
[5292.76 → 5294.72] Who was slain for the world?
[5294.72 → 5303.20] you and the eyes of all men will be fixed on the lam who was crucified
[5303.20 → 5309.44] with wisdom and mercy and justice
[5309.44 → 5316.24] and the angels will cry
[5316.24 → 5324.24] who was slain for the world
[5324.24 → 5328.24] in power
[5328.24 → 5336.24] and the earth will reply you shall reign
[5336.24 → 5344.24] as the king of all kings and the lord of all lords
[5346.24 → 5352.24] there's a shield in our hand and a sword at our side
[5352.24 → 5356.24] there's a fire in our spirit that cannot be denied
[5356.24 → 5360.24] that the father has told us for these you have died
[5360.24 → 5364.24] for the nations that gather before you
[5364.24 → 5372.24] and the ears of all men need to hear of the lamb who was crucified
[5372.24 → 5376.24] ascended to hell yet was raised up to reign as he'll fall
[5376.24 → 5378.24] on earth's side
[5378.24 → 5380.24] and the angels will cry
[5380.24 → 5384.24] hail the lamb
[5384.24 → 5388.24] who was slain for the world
[5388.24 → 5390.24] ruling
[5390.24 → 5394.24] and the earth will reply
[5394.24 → 5396.24] you shall
[5396.24 → 5398.24] raise
[5398.24 → 5402.24] as the king of all kings and the lord of all lords
[5402.24 → 5404.24] and the angels will cry
[5404.24 → 5406.24] hail the lamb
[5406.24 → 5408.24] who was slain for the world
[5408.24 → 5410.24] and the angels will cry
[5410.24 → 5412.24] hail the lamb
[5412.24 → 5414.24] who was slain for the world
[5414.24 → 5416.24] who was slain for the world
[5416.24 → 5418.24] who was slain for the world
[5418.24 → 5422.24] and the earth will reply
[5422.24 → 5426.24] you shall raise
[5426.24 → 5430.24] as the king of all kings and the lord of all lords
[5430.24 → 5432.24] as the king of all kings and the lord of all lords
[5432.24 → 5438.24] as the king of all kings and the lord of all lords
[5438.24 → 5440.24] the lord of all lords
[5440.24 → 5442.24] in the religion
[5442.24 → 5444.24] who was slain for the world
