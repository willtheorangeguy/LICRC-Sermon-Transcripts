[0.00 --> 4.00]  Times of trouble and war and strife
[4.00 --> 12.40]  Can you raise your voice to the storm cloud?
[12.72 --> 16.56]  Put the thunder and surrender ring out
[16.56 --> 21.48]  Does the lightning ask you if it's right?
[25.12 --> 29.62]  Who has left the channel for a torrent?
[30.00 --> 34.00]  Rain to sprout the desert with forests
[34.00 --> 39.00]  In the wilderness that my hand has filled
[43.00 --> 47.00]  Can you hunt the prey for young lions?
[47.00 --> 51.00]  Can you lose the course of all lions?
[51.00 --> 54.00]  Is this whole world busy?
[54.00 --> 56.00]  Believe your will!
[56.00 --> 65.00]  I smoked things I did not understand
[65.00 --> 69.00]  Things too wonderful for me
[69.00 --> 74.00]  Although I have no back to action
[74.00 --> 78.00]  I've got nothing to do
[78.00 --> 87.00]  There's reason to sit here
[87.00 --> 89.00]  Why the creatures lives similar ?
[89.00 --> 92.00]  So the question here
[92.00 --> 93.00]  No, it's the opposite
[93.00 --> 96.00]  It's how it seems because it's the present
[96.00 --> 125.98]  Thank you.
[126.00 --> 155.98]  Thank you.
[156.00 --> 158.00]  Thank you.
[186.00 --> 188.00]  Thank you.
[216.00 --> 218.00]  Thank you.
[218.00 --> 220.00]  Thank you.
[220.00 --> 222.00]  Thank you.
[222.00 --> 224.00]  Thank you.
[224.00 --> 228.26]  Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[229.88 --> 234.80]  Our God is the Lion, the Lion of Judah.
[234.80 --> 239.80]  He's roaring with power and fighting our battles.
[240.86 --> 245.20]  And every need will bow before Him.
[245.94 --> 250.80]  Our God is the Lamb, the Lamb that was slain.
[250.80 --> 256.76]  For the sin of the world, His blood breaks the chains.
[257.18 --> 262.02]  In every need will bow before the Lion and the Lamb.
[262.60 --> 267.74]  In every need will bow before the Lion and the Lamb.
[267.74 --> 274.12]  In every need will bow before the Lion and the Lamb.
[274.12 --> 278.12]  In every need will bow before the Lion and the Lamb.
[278.12 --> 281.96]  Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[281.96 --> 286.06]  Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[286.06 --> 289.12]  Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[289.12 --> 301.34]  Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[301.34 --> 306.26]  Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[306.26 --> 310.10]  Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[311.64 --> 315.54]  Oh, who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[317.12 --> 319.90]  Who can stop the Lord?
[322.04 --> 327.52]  I got him a lion, the lion of Judah
[327.52 --> 333.28]  Roaring with power and fighting my battles
[333.28 --> 337.78]  Every knee will bow before him
[337.78 --> 344.04]  Our God is the Lamb, the Lamb that was slain
[344.04 --> 349.50]  For the sin of the world, his blood breaks the chains
[349.50 --> 354.86]  In every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb
[354.86 --> 361.98]  Every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb
[361.98 --> 372.86]  Oh, and every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb
[372.86 --> 382.74]  Oh, and every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb
[382.74 --> 410.88]  Good morning
[410.88 --> 411.84]  There we go
[411.84 --> 415.32]  Welcome to Emanuel Church
[415.32 --> 419.70]  A special welcome if you are a guest with us this morning
[419.70 --> 423.68]  We are really excited to gather together to worship our God
[423.68 --> 425.54]  If you are a guest, my name is Chris
[425.54 --> 428.66]  And I'm one of the pastors here at Emanuel
[428.66 --> 432.00]  And it's my privilege to lead in worship this morning
[432.00 --> 433.42]  With these others on stage
[433.42 --> 436.56]  And a few that we haven't yet seen up here
[436.56 --> 439.32]  If you would like to connect with us
[439.32 --> 442.08]  I want to encourage you to do that at the Connect booth
[442.08 --> 443.24]  Following our worship
[443.24 --> 445.00]  Or there's cards in your seats
[445.00 --> 447.96]  You can fill those out and put them in the collection bag
[447.96 --> 448.82]  As they go by
[448.82 --> 451.42]  Or there's a QR code you can scan with your phone
[451.42 --> 453.40]  We'd love to connect with you
[453.40 --> 455.34]  And see how we can meet together
[455.34 --> 457.18]  Before we begin
[457.18 --> 459.62]  We have a couple announcements to make
[459.62 --> 461.86]  I'm going to invite Clem to the front
[461.86 --> 463.34]  He's going to get ready for his
[463.34 --> 466.56]  The first announcement I want to make is that
[466.56 --> 469.96]  Young adults, there's a Bible study after service
[469.96 --> 473.24]  Today that starts at 1 o'clock
[473.24 --> 476.22]  And so if you're interested in attending that
[476.22 --> 478.16]  And you consider yourself a young adult
[478.16 --> 480.12]  I'll let you determine that for yourselves
[480.12 --> 484.00]  You can talk to me after I can give you details
[484.00 --> 487.16]  Or you can connect with Josh who's not here yet
[487.16 --> 489.14]  But you can connect with him and reach out
[489.14 --> 490.16]  And get details for that
[490.16 --> 491.58]  Why don't you go ahead
[491.58 --> 498.34]  This looks on
[498.34 --> 499.06]  Oh, there we go
[499.06 --> 502.52]  Okay, so I'm sure everyone here
[502.52 --> 504.36]  Follows our online bulletin
[504.36 --> 505.84]  And midweek memo
[505.84 --> 508.02]  But just in case you missed it
[508.02 --> 511.24]  The HD Stafford Breakfast Program team
[511.24 --> 512.88]  Is looking for more volunteers
[512.88 --> 514.94]  We've had a few retire
[514.94 --> 516.66]  And some health issues
[516.66 --> 519.12]  So we need two alternates
[519.12 --> 521.36]  People who can fill in for sickness
[521.36 --> 523.20]  And in health holidays
[523.20 --> 526.84]  And that was lame, I know
[526.84 --> 531.46]  And we're also looking for a permanent volunteer
[531.46 --> 533.82]  To cover two Thursdays a month
[533.82 --> 535.14]  During the school year
[535.14 --> 537.54]  So you can reach out to either
[537.54 --> 538.38]  Faye Shonet
[538.38 --> 539.70]  I don't know if she's here
[539.70 --> 544.34]  Or myself, Clem Molenkamp
[544.34 --> 546.22]  Thanks in advance
[546.22 --> 547.84]  And look forward to working with you
[547.84 --> 553.18]  Thanks, Clem
[553.18 --> 559.14]  Additionally, I want to let you know
[559.14 --> 561.72]  That on March 2nd
[561.72 --> 563.08]  We are going to be hosting
[563.08 --> 565.38]  Our annual Mexico dinner
[565.38 --> 566.80]  And so every year
[566.80 --> 567.68]  We send a group
[567.68 --> 569.28]  Down to Mexico
[569.28 --> 571.56]  A group primarily of youth
[571.56 --> 572.34]  Young people
[572.34 --> 574.56]  Although not exclusively so
[574.56 --> 576.08]  And we have a dinner
[576.08 --> 577.14]  In support of that
[577.14 --> 579.00]  And so on March 2nd
[579.00 --> 580.10]  That dinner will be happening
[580.10 --> 581.58]  You can sign up for that
[581.58 --> 582.92]  At the Connect table as well
[582.92 --> 583.62]  After service
[583.62 --> 585.12]  Also there are links
[585.12 --> 587.02]  To the digital sign up
[587.02 --> 588.04]  In the e-bulletin
[588.04 --> 588.56]  And the like
[588.56 --> 590.48]  Brandon, who's right up front here
[590.48 --> 591.66]  He can answer your questions
[591.66 --> 593.56]  And give you the details on that
[593.56 --> 596.22]  And then we also wanted
[596.22 --> 597.60]  Everyone to know
[597.60 --> 599.80]  And remember that next Sunday
[599.80 --> 601.40]  Is Cadet Sunday
[601.40 --> 602.96]  And so February 25
[602.96 --> 604.72]  We're going to be worshipping
[604.72 --> 606.40]  And the cadets are going to help us do that
[606.40 --> 608.16]  That's a boys group ministry
[608.16 --> 609.34]  We're going to hear about
[609.34 --> 610.14]  What they've been up to
[610.14 --> 611.20]  This year as well
[611.20 --> 613.12]  And lastly
[613.12 --> 615.10]  This coming Saturday
[615.10 --> 616.62]  February 24
[616.62 --> 618.56]  Is Coldest Night of the Year
[618.56 --> 621.48]  That's an event that takes place
[621.48 --> 622.82]  It's organized by
[622.82 --> 624.20]  Coldest Night of the Year
[624.20 --> 625.14]  In partnership with
[625.14 --> 626.04]  Gateway of Hope
[626.04 --> 627.64]  In supporting homelessness
[627.64 --> 629.08]  And poverty issues
[629.08 --> 629.88]  In our community
[629.88 --> 631.00]  We have a team
[631.00 --> 632.78]  That's walking in that event
[632.78 --> 634.58]  And so there's still time
[634.58 --> 635.16]  To sign up
[635.16 --> 636.10]  To join the team
[636.10 --> 637.66]  And if you join the team
[637.66 --> 638.80]  That means you can walk
[638.80 --> 639.68]  And participate
[639.68 --> 640.86]  And be with us
[640.86 --> 642.58]  Meeting at Gateway of Hope
[642.58 --> 644.62]  Or you can support the team
[644.62 --> 646.02]  And that means give a donation
[646.02 --> 647.36]  In support
[647.36 --> 650.42]  There are a number of us
[650.42 --> 651.14]  On the team
[651.14 --> 652.28]  Who have not yet met
[652.28 --> 653.38]  Their donation goals
[653.38 --> 654.72]  And so I encourage you
[654.72 --> 656.02]  To look at the list
[656.02 --> 656.78]  And support those
[656.78 --> 657.42]  Who are trying to meet
[657.42 --> 658.06]  Their targets
[658.06 --> 660.74]  I won't say who that is
[660.74 --> 662.32]  But I'll look at my family
[662.32 --> 663.06]  Just to be sure
[663.06 --> 665.28]  Also the Lobert family
[665.28 --> 666.30]  Has a big goal to meet
[666.30 --> 667.70]  And I think everyone else
[667.70 --> 668.20]  Yet anyway
[668.20 --> 668.84]  Point is
[668.84 --> 669.88]  Please support that
[669.88 --> 670.70]  By either joining
[670.70 --> 672.62]  Or donating together
[672.62 --> 675.44]  I think that's all
[675.44 --> 676.18]  For our announcements
[676.18 --> 677.36]  I'm going to invite you
[677.36 --> 677.90]  To stand
[677.90 --> 678.98]  As you're able
[678.98 --> 679.82]  And where you are
[679.82 --> 681.36]  As we are ushered
[681.36 --> 682.84]  Into the presence of God
[682.84 --> 684.10]  In worship together
[684.10 --> 687.36]  Receive then
[687.36 --> 687.96]  The greeting
[687.96 --> 690.12]  Of our good God
[690.12 --> 692.24]  Grace
[692.24 --> 693.50]  Mercy
[693.50 --> 694.72]  And peace to you
[694.72 --> 695.90]  From God our Father
[695.90 --> 697.68]  From the Lord Jesus Christ
[697.68 --> 698.18]  His Son
[698.18 --> 698.88]  And our Savior
[698.88 --> 700.02]  Through the presence
[700.02 --> 700.60]  And power
[700.60 --> 701.78]  Of the Holy Spirit
[701.78 --> 703.10]  All God's people said
[703.10 --> 704.24]  Amen
[704.24 --> 705.44]  Let's worship God
[705.44 --> 705.82]  This morning
[705.82 --> 712.92]  Our call to worship
[712.92 --> 715.82]  Comes from Psalm 63
[715.82 --> 717.28]  Verse 1 to 4
[717.28 --> 720.10]  O God you are my God
[720.10 --> 721.94]  Earnestly I seek you
[721.94 --> 724.20]  My soul thirsts for you
[724.20 --> 726.64]  My flesh faints for you
[726.64 --> 728.20]  As in a dry
[728.20 --> 729.16]  And weary land
[729.16 --> 730.44]  Where there is no water
[730.44 --> 732.76]  So I have looked upon you
[732.76 --> 733.70]  In the sanctuary
[733.70 --> 735.36]  Beholding your power
[735.36 --> 736.08]  And your glory
[736.08 --> 738.22]  Because your steadfast love
[738.22 --> 739.22]  Is better than life
[739.22 --> 741.22]  My lips will praise you
[741.22 --> 743.00]  So I will bless you
[743.00 --> 745.10]  As long as I live
[745.10 --> 746.32]  In your name
[746.32 --> 747.98]  I will lift up my hands
[747.98 --> 750.14]  Let's worship God together
[750.14 --> 777.94]  Thank you
[777.94 --> 789.56]  Light of the world, you step down into darkness. Open my eyes, let me see.
[790.56 --> 801.56]  Beauty that made it is hard to adore you. Hope of all lives within you.
[801.56 --> 815.56]  Here I am to worship and here I am to bow and here I am to sing and you are the one.
[816.32 --> 826.78]  Thoughts you never love me, thoughts you never love me, thoughts you never want me, thoughts you never want me, come to me.
[831.56 --> 842.56]  King of all days are so highly exalted, glorious in heaven and above.
[843.56 --> 853.56]  Come be a king to the earth you created, all for the sake you gave me.
[853.56 --> 867.56]  Here I am to worship and here I am to bow and here I am to sing and you are the one.
[867.56 --> 879.56]  All together, all together worthy, all together wonderful to live.
[879.56 --> 886.56]  Here I am to worship and here I am to worship.
[886.56 --> 892.74]  To see the sin of water go.
[893.14 --> 898.54]  To be the Lord, how much it goes.
[898.98 --> 904.50]  To see the sin of water go.
[906.92 --> 912.46]  Here I am to worship, here I am to help.
[912.46 --> 918.18]  Here I am to save and for I know.
[918.78 --> 924.28]  All together loving, all together perfect.
[924.90 --> 929.34]  All together wonderful to be.
[930.76 --> 936.40]  Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down.
[936.40 --> 941.40]  Here I am to save and for I know.
[942.46 --> 947.84]  All together loving, all together worthy.
[948.36 --> 952.82]  All together wonderful to be.
[953.00 --> 957.50]  While all together loving, all together well and yeah.
[958.72 --> 960.68]  Quit that secret.
[960.80 --> 962.40]  Huh.
[962.60 --> 964.02]  Fuck.
[964.28 --> 964.84]  Oh.
[964.84 --> 992.40]  I pray for one
[992.40 --> 997.88]  so unchanging
[997.88 --> 1003.16]  Ageless Father
[1003.16 --> 1006.70]  You're my love
[1006.70 --> 1009.76]  You're peace
[1009.76 --> 1013.90]  Born upon
[1013.90 --> 1018.64]  I depend on You
[1018.64 --> 1025.08]  I call up to You
[1025.08 --> 1030.64]  Again and again
[1030.64 --> 1036.64]  I call up to You
[1036.64 --> 1040.64]  Again and again
[1040.64 --> 1047.08]  You are my love
[1047.08 --> 1052.64]  You die so strong
[1052.64 --> 1058.64]  You lift me up
[1058.64 --> 1063.08]  When I fall down
[1063.08 --> 1067.86]  All through the storm
[1067.86 --> 1073.08]  Your love is
[1073.08 --> 1077.08]  The anchor
[1077.08 --> 1084.52]  My hope is in You
[1084.52 --> 1092.96]  In Your life
[1092.96 --> 1096.96]  So unchanging
[1096.96 --> 1103.96]  Ageless Father
[1103.96 --> 1107.40]  You're my love
[1107.40 --> 1108.40]  You're my love
[1108.40 --> 1110.40]  You're my love
[1110.40 --> 1112.40]  You're my love
[1112.40 --> 1114.84]  Lord of all
[1114.84 --> 1118.84]  I depend on You
[1118.84 --> 1125.40]  I call up to You
[1125.40 --> 1130.84]  Again and again
[1130.84 --> 1137.28]  I call up to You
[1137.28 --> 1140.84]  Again and again
[1140.84 --> 1147.34]  You are my love
[1147.34 --> 1151.28]  Every time is my trouble
[1151.28 --> 1153.72]  You're my love
[1153.72 --> 1154.72]  You're my love
[1154.72 --> 1155.72]  You're my love
[1155.72 --> 1156.72]  You're my love
[1156.72 --> 1157.72]  You're my love
[1157.72 --> 1159.72]  You're my love
[1159.72 --> 1162.72]  When I fall down
[1162.72 --> 1166.72]  All through the storm
[1166.72 --> 1172.78]  Your love is
[1172.78 --> 1177.22]  The anchor
[1177.22 --> 1178.22]  My hope is
[1178.22 --> 1181.22]  The anchor
[1181.22 --> 1182.22]  My hope is
[1182.22 --> 1188.22]  The anchor
[1188.22 --> 1193.22]  My hope is
[1193.22 --> 1209.94]  My love is the anchor, my hope is in you alone.
[1212.06 --> 1213.22]  You may be seated.
[1223.22 --> 1225.82]  Please join me as we quiet our hearts in prayer.
[1230.58 --> 1237.30]  Almighty, holy, and perfect God, we confess and admit that each of us needs your forgiveness
[1237.30 --> 1238.76]  over and over.
[1239.30 --> 1239.98]  We have sinned.
[1240.58 --> 1244.74]  We have not always been the salt and light in this world that you want us to be.
[1246.02 --> 1250.98]  Lord, some of our sins may have been obvious to those around us, and some may have been
[1250.98 --> 1254.84]  the sins of the heart, kept secret from everyone except you.
[1256.10 --> 1260.46]  Lord, hear our prayers now as we take a moment in personal silent confession.
[1280.98 --> 1281.46]  Amen.
[1286.10 --> 1286.70]  Amen.
[1286.70 --> 1287.08]  Amen.
[1287.10 --> 1287.14]  Amen.
[1287.14 --> 1287.70]  Amen.
[1287.70 --> 1293.16]  Jesus Christ, we thank you for your forgiveness and are thankful that in 1 John you assure us
[1293.16 --> 1299.22]  that if we confess our sins, you are faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify
[1299.22 --> 1301.14]  us from all unrighteousness.
[1301.46 --> 1305.72]  We thank you, Jesus, for your sacrifice, and in your name alone we pray.
[1306.14 --> 1306.42]  Amen.
[1306.42 --> 1306.52]  Amen.
[1306.52 --> 1306.58]  Amen.
[1310.98 --> 1334.34]  I love you, Lord.
[1334.34 --> 1339.56]  I am the Lord.
[1339.56 --> 1349.70]  To worship you, oh, my soul rejoice.
[1349.70 --> 1360.32]  Take joy, my dear, in what you feel.
[1360.32 --> 1369.32]  Make me a sweet, sweet song in your ear.
[1369.32 --> 1376.32]  I love you, Lord.
[1376.32 --> 1382.64]  And I love my voice.
[1382.64 --> 1384.64]  I love you, Lord.
[1384.64 --> 1386.64]  I love you, Lord.
[1386.64 --> 1389.64]  I love you, Lord.
[1389.64 --> 1391.64]  I love you, Lord.
[1391.64 --> 1396.78]  Take joy, my dear.
[1396.78 --> 1403.78]  Take joy, my dear.
[1403.78 --> 1406.92]  Give me a sweet season.
[1406.92 --> 1411.92]  In your healing
[1411.92 --> 1417.92]  I exalt thee
[1417.92 --> 1423.92]  I exalt thee
[1423.92 --> 1429.92]  I exalt thee
[1429.92 --> 1432.92]  Oh Lord
[1432.92 --> 1440.92]  I exalt thee
[1440.92 --> 1445.92]  I exalt thee
[1445.92 --> 1451.92]  I exalt thee
[1451.92 --> 1455.92]  Oh Lord
[1455.92 --> 1461.92]  If the Lord I come
[1461.92 --> 1467.92]  And all the earth
[1467.92 --> 1471.92]  I exalt thee
[1471.92 --> 1473.92]  Oh Lord
[1473.92 --> 1479.92]  When thou
[1479.92 --> 1481.92]  Are you
[1481.92 --> 1483.92]  Lord
[1483.92 --> 1485.92]  Lord
[1485.92 --> 1491.92]  Thou are you
[1491.92 --> 1497.92]  Lord
[1497.92 --> 1501.92]  I exalt thee
[1501.92 --> 1503.92]  I exalt thee
[1503.92 --> 1509.92]  I exalt thee
[1509.92 --> 1513.92]  I exalt thee
[1513.92 --> 1515.92]  Oh Lord
[1515.92 --> 1517.92]  I exalt thee
[1517.92 --> 1527.92]  I exalt thee
[1527.92 --> 1529.92]  I exalt thee
[1529.92 --> 1531.92]  I exalt thee
[1531.92 --> 1535.92]  I exalt thee
[1535.92 --> 1537.92]  Oh Lord
[1537.92 --> 1547.92]  I exalt thee
[1547.92 --> 1549.92]  I exalt thee
[1549.92 --> 1551.92]  I exalt thee
[1551.92 --> 1553.92]  I exalt thee
[1553.92 --> 1555.92]  I exalt thee
[1555.92 --> 1557.92]  I exalt thee
[1557.92 --> 1558.92]  In our worship
[1558.92 --> 1559.92]  This morning
[1559.92 --> 1561.92]  We get to administer
[1561.92 --> 1563.92]  And participate
[1563.92 --> 1565.92]  In the sacrament of baptism
[1565.92 --> 1567.92]  For one of the little children
[1567.92 --> 1568.92]  Among us
[1568.92 --> 1569.92]  For safety
[1569.92 --> 1572.92]  We believe that the water itself
[1572.92 --> 1575.92]  Does not cleanse from sin
[1575.92 --> 1577.92]  But rather that it symbolizes for us
[1577.92 --> 1579.92]  Jesus life death and resurrection
[1579.92 --> 1584.92]  And that this child born with a sinful nature
[1584.92 --> 1589.92]  Is offered the promises of God for forgiveness and life in the Holy Spirit
[1589.92 --> 1595.92]  And so in our reformed tradition we baptize infants not out of superstition
[1595.92 --> 1599.92]  But because they are covenant children
[1599.92 --> 1608.92]  Now this idea of covenant is rooted in God's promise to Abraham that was sealed in the sign of circumcision
[1608.92 --> 1615.92]  And in baptism now the triune God seals the promise of our adoption as his children
[1615.92 --> 1619.92]  Marking for us a new identity in Christ Jesus
[1619.92 --> 1624.92]  And so we baptize in obedience to Christ's command
[1624.92 --> 1629.92]  We baptize in line with the history of the Christian church and the teaching of the Bible
[1629.92 --> 1632.92]  Throughout God's redemptive work in the world
[1632.92 --> 1637.92]  Baptism signifies and seals inclusion in the covenant community
[1637.92 --> 1639.92]  And cleansing from sin
[1639.92 --> 1644.92]  And this morning we pray that Sadie embraces her covenant privileges
[1644.92 --> 1648.92]  That she acknowledges her Lord throughout her life
[1648.92 --> 1653.92]  To do that we have a bit of a liturgy that will have questions for Brandon and Sav
[1653.92 --> 1656.92]  And also for you in participation
[1656.92 --> 1660.92]  So this time I'm going to invite Brandon, Sav and your family up to the front
[1660.92 --> 1688.92]  To begin I'm going to ask you guys two questions and at the end I will invite you to respond by saying we do with God's help
[1688.92 --> 1699.92]  First, do you believe that your children, though sinful by nature, are received by God in Christ as members of his covenant and therefore ought to be baptized?
[1699.92 --> 1703.92]  Second, I appreciate your eagerness
[1703.92 --> 1714.92]  Do you promise in reliance on the Holy Spirit and with the help of the Christian community to do all in your power to instruct Sadie and all your children in the Christian faith
[1714.92 --> 1718.92]  And lead them by your example into the life of Christian discipleship?
[1718.92 --> 1720.92]  What is your answer?
[1720.92 --> 1721.92]  Amen
[1721.92 --> 1731.92]  Our Lord Jesus said, let the little children come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these
[1731.92 --> 1738.92]  And so to mark that and participate in that we're going to invite all the little children and the young at heart to come forward
[1738.92 --> 1745.92]  And just sit up here so that you can see and engage, participate, remember your own baptisms for some of you
[1745.92 --> 1750.92]  And so you can get a good look at beautiful Sadie
[1750.92 --> 1760.92]  Awesome
[1760.92 --> 1763.92]  Look at this, they're coming in waves
[1763.92 --> 1769.92]  All right
[1769.92 --> 1777.92]  Guys, in just a moment we're going to take this water and we're going to pour it over Sadie's head
[1777.92 --> 1785.92]  This water is a picture for us of the promise for Jesus' blood to wash us and make us new
[1785.92 --> 1786.92]  New
[1786.92 --> 1796.92]  That's why we pour it on her head, that's why we mark the cleanliness of God's gift of faith and new life in him with this water
[1797.92 --> 1799.92]  I'm going to present her
[1800.92 --> 1803.92]  Sadie Brook Muller
[1803.92 --> 1806.92]  I baptize you in the name of the Father
[1806.92 --> 1808.92]  And of the Son
[1809.92 --> 1811.92]  And of the Holy Spirit
[1811.92 --> 1812.92]  Amen
[1815.92 --> 1819.92]  Good job
[1819.92 --> 1820.92]  Hey
[1825.92 --> 1826.92]  Congregation
[1826.92 --> 1830.92]  We have an opportunity to share in this moment together
[1830.92 --> 1833.92]  And so I'm going to invite you also to stand
[1833.92 --> 1836.92]  And kids, you guys can stand as well
[1836.92 --> 1842.92]  And then after this question, after we answer it together, you can go back to your parents and to your seats, okay?
[1842.92 --> 1851.92]  And so, family of God, do you promise to love, encourage, and support Brandon, Sav, Hayden, and now Sadie?
[1852.92 --> 1865.92]  By welcoming them into our church family, by teaching the gospel of God's love, by being an example of Christian faith and character, and by giving the strong support of God's family in fellowship, prayer, and service?
[1865.92 --> 1866.92]  What is your answer?
[1866.92 --> 1867.92]  We do, and God's help us
[1867.92 --> 1869.92]  We do, and God's help us
[1869.92 --> 1870.92]  Amen
[1870.92 --> 1871.92]  You may be seated
[1871.92 --> 1875.92]  May I take her for a moment?
[1875.92 --> 1880.92]  Yeah, you guys can just come down, no?
[1881.92 --> 1883.92]  Oh, I know
[1883.92 --> 1884.92]  I know
[1884.92 --> 1886.92]  Hey, beautiful
[1886.92 --> 1896.92]  Feels like I've been making this journey a lot in the last little month
[1896.92 --> 1907.92]  Today, in baptism, we mark what we hope and pray will be the beginning of Sadie's journey of faith among us
[1907.92 --> 1914.92]  That this won't be the last time we see her come up to the front as she runs up for the front for children's worship
[1914.92 --> 1917.92]  And as she races out to the back for children's worship time
[1917.92 --> 1920.92]  As she joins with the other girls in gems
[1920.92 --> 1923.92]  As she gathers in worship
[1923.92 --> 1926.92]  As maybe even one day she goes on the Mexico mission trip
[1926.92 --> 1929.92]  And probably one day sooner than everyone else her age
[1929.92 --> 1932.92]  Because Brandon and Sav go together often
[1932.92 --> 1935.92]  But it is our prayer and our firm hope
[1935.92 --> 1939.92]  That what begins today continues in her life
[1939.92 --> 1946.92]  Continues as she grows in the faith and in the knowledge of her Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ
[1946.92 --> 1950.92]  And we all together pray that one day
[1951.92 --> 1952.92]  Hey?
[1952.92 --> 1954.92]  Sorry, she just smiled at me, it was really cute
[1955.92 --> 1959.92]  That one day she will stand in front of us and profess her faith
[1959.92 --> 1965.92]  That she will take the promises offered to her here and claim them as her own
[1965.92 --> 1969.92]  This is our prayer together
[1969.92 --> 1970.92]  Hey
[1970.92 --> 1976.92]  I know, I know
[1976.92 --> 1977.92]  Which one?
[1978.92 --> 1985.92]  We want to mark this occasion for you guys with a gift
[1985.92 --> 1990.92]  And so I'm going to invite Daryl Wind, who's their elder, to come forward
[1990.92 --> 1994.92]  Share a gift and a certificate with you marking this occasion
[2004.92 --> 2006.92]  And before you sit together
[2006.92 --> 2008.92]  We're going to pray for Sadie and for you
[2008.92 --> 2010.92]  And I'm going to invite all of you as you're sitting
[2010.92 --> 2011.92]  If you are so moved
[2011.92 --> 2013.92]  Just to hold out your hand
[2013.92 --> 2017.92]  As we pray a blessing over her this morning
[2017.92 --> 2018.92]  Let's pray together
[2021.92 --> 2022.92]  Holy God
[2022.92 --> 2025.92]  We are moved by your grace
[2026.92 --> 2029.92]  And we are compelled by your work in the world
[2029.92 --> 2032.92]  To offer this promise to Sadie today
[2032.92 --> 2040.92]  We are so moved by the covenantal inclusion that you have granted upon her as a child of faith
[2041.92 --> 2044.92]  And we pray that today and every day going forward, Lord
[2044.92 --> 2046.92]  That you would bless her and keep her
[2047.92 --> 2050.92]  That you would make your face to shine upon her and be gracious to her
[2051.92 --> 2053.92]  That you would turn your face towards her
[2054.92 --> 2056.92]  And that she would know your peace
[2056.92 --> 2061.92]  In this way, Lord God, write your name on her forehead
[2062.92 --> 2063.92]  And may she know you
[2064.92 --> 2065.92]  In Christ Jesus we pray
[2066.92 --> 2067.92]  Amen
[2068.92 --> 2069.92]  Amen
[2070.92 --> 2071.92]  Thank you guys, you may have a seat
[2072.92 --> 2077.92]  We're going to stand and sing together a song that Brandon and Sav have picked for us
[2078.92 --> 2079.92]  In recognition and celebration of this
[2080.92 --> 2082.92]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me
[2083.92 --> 2084.92]  We can stand together
[2086.92 --> 2087.92]  Yep
[2087.92 --> 2089.92]  Amen
[2091.92 --> 2093.92]  Amen
[2094.92 --> 2095.92]  Diversity
[2095.92 --> 2102.92]  Jesus, Lord, I am here.
[2115.92 --> 2122.00]  What kind of grace to Jesus, my Redeemer?
[2122.00 --> 2127.62]  There is no more than for heaven now to give.
[2128.70 --> 2133.88]  He is my Lord, my righteousness and freedom.
[2134.60 --> 2139.88]  My steadfast love, my kingdom now is peace.
[2140.62 --> 2145.76]  To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus.
[2145.76 --> 2151.54]  For my life is only now to give.
[2152.90 --> 2157.34]  Oh, how strange and divine I can sing.
[2157.54 --> 2163.46]  All is mine, if not I, but when Christ is me.
[2163.46 --> 2193.46] 
[2193.46 --> 2198.80]  His power is only Jesus.
[2198.80 --> 2204.14]  Oh, my steadfast love, my strength and divine I can sing.
[2204.14 --> 2209.48]  Oh, my steadfast love, my strength and divine I can sing.
[2209.48 --> 2214.82]  For the night has been on and I shall overcome.
[2214.82 --> 2244.82] 
[2244.82 --> 2250.16]  Oh, my steadfast love, my strength and divine I can sing.
[2250.16 --> 2254.16]  Oh, my steadfast love, my strength and divine I can sing.
[2254.16 --> 2259.50]  Oh, my steadfast love, my strength and divine I can sing.
[2259.50 --> 2264.84]  Jesus, how and my strength and divine I can sing.
[2264.84 --> 2270.18]  Oh, my steadfast love, my strength and divine I can sing.
[2270.18 --> 2274.18]  Oh, my steadfast love, my strength and divine I can sing.
[2274.18 --> 2286.52]  Oh, my steadfast love, my strength and divine I can sing.
[2286.52 --> 2288.90]  Oh, my steadfast love, my strength and divine I can sing.
[2288.90 --> 2289.62]  Oh, my steadfast love, my strength and divine I can sing.
[2289.62 --> 2293.00]  Oh, my steadfast love, my strength and divine I can sing.
[2293.00 --> 2298.74]  For He has said that He will bring me home.
[2298.74 --> 2305.22]  And day by day I know He will renew me
[2305.22 --> 2311.64]  Until I stand with joy before the throne
[2311.64 --> 2318.46]  To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus
[2318.46 --> 2324.26]  All the glory evermore to Him
[2324.26 --> 2331.08]  When the race is complete, still my lips shall be me
[2331.08 --> 2335.74]  Yet not I, a new Christ in me
[2335.74 --> 2342.42]  To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus
[2342.42 --> 2349.32]  All the glory evermore to Him
[2349.32 --> 2356.14]  When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat
[2356.14 --> 2362.32]  Yet not I, a new Christ in me
[2362.32 --> 2369.14]  When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat
[2369.14 --> 2375.14]  Yet not I, a new Christ in me
[2375.14 --> 2383.14]  Yet not I, a new Christ in me
[2383.14 --> 2387.04]  Let me see you
[2387.04 --> 2411.86]  Hello
[2411.86 --> 2413.34]  Good morning
[2413.34 --> 2416.42]  My name is Clem and I'm one of the deacons here at Emmanuel
[2416.42 --> 2419.54]  The first offering is for our church budget
[2419.54 --> 2422.88]  The special offering is for the Gateway of Hope
[2422.88 --> 2425.82]  Which is located on the bypass by
[2425.82 --> 2429.50]  Quantlin College
[2429.50 --> 2433.16]  They are a ministry of the Salvation Army
[2433.16 --> 2436.40]  And they serve the city and township of Langley
[2436.40 --> 2443.08]  The Gateway of Hope raises awareness for the hurt, hungry, and homeless in our communities
[2443.08 --> 2452.38]  Also, an emergency shelter, basic medical services, resources for transitional support, and much more
[2452.38 --> 2456.70]  Let's pray for these people
[2456.70 --> 2460.66]  Benevolent Father, thank you for your love
[2460.66 --> 2463.76]  Which is a wellspring of life to us all
[2463.76 --> 2467.48]  Thank you for preserving the lives of the homeless
[2467.48 --> 2472.72]  You are a shelter and a strong tower for those who need refuge
[2472.72 --> 2478.70]  We thank you for your enduring grace that covers those who cannot take care of themselves
[2478.70 --> 2482.10]  We will praise you at all times
[2482.10 --> 2484.64]  We will constantly speak your praises
[2484.64 --> 2487.14]  We will boast only in you
[2487.14 --> 2491.26]  Let all who are helpless take heart
[2491.26 --> 2493.48]  We will tell of your greatness
[2493.48 --> 2495.64]  And exalt your name together
[2495.64 --> 2496.22]  Amen
[2496.22 --> 2498.24]  Amen

[2525.88 --> 2531.16]  To let my heart be changed
[2531.16 --> 2536.32]  For you, your love with grace
[2536.32 --> 2541.16]  And your love with you
[2541.16 --> 2549.00]  Going down to go
[2549.00 --> 2552.16]  The ruthless things I see
[2552.16 --> 2558.16]  In me, we'll be stripped away
[2558.16 --> 2563.52]  By the power of the Lord
[2563.52 --> 2576.16]  Holy Ghost, let your love surround me
[2576.16 --> 2582.16]  Bring in, bring in
[2582.16 --> 2586.16]  Glory to your Son
[2586.16 --> 2592.16]  For now, as I will be
[2592.16 --> 2596.16]  A love that I believe
[2596.16 --> 2600.16]  And I will soar with you
[2600.16 --> 2602.16]  Rest here in the old
[2602.16 --> 2606.16]  The power of the Lord
[2606.16 --> 2612.16]  And I will soar with you
[2612.16 --> 2614.16]  For now, as I will show you
[2614.16 --> 2616.16]  And I will soar with you
[2616.16 --> 2618.16]  The Lord
[2618.16 --> 2624.16]  The heart of your heart is living
[2624.16 --> 2634.16]  Lord, I will come, my Lord
[2635.06 --> 2640.30]  Nothing will unfolds in my heart
[2640.30 --> 2644.16]  Be living every day
[2644.16 --> 2650.26]  The heart of your love
[2650.26 --> 2662.16]  Lord, we are left to love surround me
[2662.16 --> 2672.16]  Bring me glory to your side
[2672.16 --> 2678.16]  And as a way of life
[2678.16 --> 2684.16]  I will soar with you
[2684.16 --> 2688.16]  Your spirit leads me on
[2688.16 --> 2692.16]  In the power of your love
[2692.16 --> 2696.16]  And I will soar with you
[2696.16 --> 2698.16]  Your spirit leads me on
[2698.16 --> 2702.16]  In the power of your love
[2702.16 --> 2716.16]  I'd like to welcome all the kids up here for Kids Corner
[2718.16 --> 2720.16]  Hey, can you guys back up a little bit?
[2720.16 --> 2730.16]  We got some real eager ones and then some stragglers
[2730.16 --> 2734.16]  Alright, I'm going to say good morning to you guys
[2734.16 --> 2736.16]  But I want you to say it really loud
[2736.16 --> 2738.16]  So everybody in the back can hear your response
[2738.16 --> 2740.16]  Does that work?
[2740.16 --> 2742.16]  Good morning
[2742.16 --> 2744.16]  Morning
[2744.16 --> 2745.16]  Excellent
[2745.16 --> 2746.16]  I want to ask you guys a question
[2746.16 --> 2748.16]  Does anybody in this group ever go camping?
[2748.16 --> 2752.16]  Everybody, almost
[2752.16 --> 2754.16]  Some parents maybe don't like camping
[2754.16 --> 2756.16]  They like glamping maybe more
[2756.16 --> 2758.16]  Is that what's going on?
[2758.16 --> 2760.16]  What's one of the cool things about camping
[2760.16 --> 2762.16]  When I was a kid is
[2762.16 --> 2764.16]  Did you ever get a flashlight when you get to go camping?
[2764.16 --> 2768.16]  Do your parents give you a flashlight to play with in the dark?
[2768.16 --> 2769.16]  Yeah?
[2769.16 --> 2770.16]  It's fun to play
[2770.16 --> 2772.16]  Do you like to play flashlight tag and stuff like that?
[2772.16 --> 2774.16]  And sit in your tent or in your camper
[2774.16 --> 2776.16]  And just play with the flashlight on the ceiling?
[2780.16 --> 2782.16]  A three room or tent?
[2782.16 --> 2783.16]  Nice
[2783.16 --> 2784.16]  What's the thing about flashlights?
[2784.16 --> 2786.16]  What's cool about them Malachi?
[2786.16 --> 2788.16]  They have light
[2788.16 --> 2790.16]  And when it's dark it's great to have
[2790.16 --> 2794.16]  Can anybody think of some other examples of things that give off light in the dark?
[2794.16 --> 2796.16]  Give me one
[2800.16 --> 2802.16]  Headlights, headlamp
[2802.16 --> 2804.16]  The Holy Spirit gives off light in the dark?
[2804.16 --> 2806.16]  Good answer
[2806.16 --> 2808.16]  A lamp
[2808.16 --> 2810.16]  How about you?
[2810.16 --> 2812.16]  A glow worm
[2812.16 --> 2814.16]  Okay, I've got some pictures up here
[2814.16 --> 2816.16]  See I've got some examples of light in the dark
[2816.16 --> 2818.16]  Let's see the first one
[2818.16 --> 2819.16]  Did somebody say candle?
[2819.16 --> 2820.16]  That's a good one eh?
[2820.16 --> 2822.16]  When the power goes out sometimes the candles come out at home
[2822.16 --> 2824.16]  Next one
[2824.16 --> 2826.16]  Ooh
[2826.16 --> 2828.16]  Is there such thing as a glow in the
[2828.16 --> 2832.16]  Is there such thing as glow in the dark jellyfish out there?
[2832.16 --> 2834.16]  Alright, next
[2834.16 --> 2836.16]  What's that?
[2836.16 --> 2838.16]  Ooh, those are kind of good
[2838.16 --> 2839.16]  We kind of need those
[2839.16 --> 2840.16]  Next
[2840.16 --> 2842.16]  Christmas lights
[2842.16 --> 2844.16]  And the last one
[2844.16 --> 2846.16]  Does anybody know what that is?
[2846.16 --> 2847.16]  Yes
[2847.16 --> 2848.16]  They're so cool
[2848.16 --> 2850.16]  When I was a kid we used to collect them and put them in a jar
[2850.16 --> 2853.16]  And run around with these fireflies in the jar
[2853.16 --> 2854.16]  It was really cool
[2854.16 --> 2858.16]  What's the story about why are we talking about light?
[2858.16 --> 2862.16]  The story today in the back we're going to talk about being a light for Jesus
[2862.16 --> 2868.16]  We're going to go into the world and be a light for Jesus and be how Jesus would like us to be
[2868.16 --> 2869.16]  Sound good?
[2869.16 --> 2872.16]  Can I get all you guys to stand up and face that way?
[2872.16 --> 2874.16]  We're going to do the blessing
[2874.16 --> 2876.16]  Ready?
[2876.16 --> 2879.16]  Lord be with you
[2879.16 --> 2881.16]  And also with you
[2906.16 --> 2907.16]  Morning, my name is Dick
[2907.16 --> 2909.16]  And I'm leading us in
[2909.16 --> 2910.16]  Contraditional prayer
[2910.16 --> 2911.16]  But before I do
[2911.16 --> 2913.16]  I just want to acknowledge the fish
[2913.16 --> 2915.16]  Pretty awesome
[2915.16 --> 2917.16]  I didn't see the ones on that side
[2917.16 --> 2919.16]  I saw the ones on the back
[2919.16 --> 2921.16]  From the thing when I came in
[2921.16 --> 2922.16]  But
[2922.16 --> 2923.16]  You think about it
[2923.16 --> 2924.16]  Each one
[2924.16 --> 2925.16]  Swims through life
[2926.16 --> 2928.16]  And then when they come into contact with Jesus
[2928.16 --> 2929.16]  And his word and his
[2929.16 --> 2931.16]  Gift for all of us
[2932.16 --> 2934.16]  And then we have probably some that are not on here
[2934.16 --> 2936.16]  That he's already called home
[2937.16 --> 2939.16]  Anyway, let's pray
[2939.16 --> 2941.16]  Father of art in heaven, Lord
[2941.16 --> 2942.16]  Thank you
[2943.16 --> 2944.16]  Thank you for today
[2944.16 --> 2945.16]  Thank you for Sadie
[2945.16 --> 2947.16]  Thank you for her family, Lord
[2947.16 --> 2950.16]  We pray will you bless her
[2950.16 --> 2952.16]  Will you bless her family through her
[2952.16 --> 2954.16]  And will you bless her through them
[2954.16 --> 2957.16]  Lord as we
[2957.16 --> 2958.16]  Lord as we
[2958.16 --> 2959.16]  Think about
[2959.16 --> 2960.16]  Psalm 139
[2960.16 --> 2962.16]  We realize that
[2962.16 --> 2964.16]  You knew Sadie
[2964.16 --> 2965.16]  Before she was Sadie
[2966.16 --> 2968.16]  You've got all her days
[2969.16 --> 2970.16]  Arranged for her
[2971.16 --> 2973.16]  Just like the rest of us, Lord
[2973.16 --> 2974.16]  You know exactly
[2975.16 --> 2976.16]  Where we're at
[2976.16 --> 2977.16]  You know exactly
[2978.16 --> 2979.16]  What we think
[2979.16 --> 2981.16]  And Lord
[2981.16 --> 2982.16]  You call each one of us
[2982.16 --> 2985.16]  And you sent your son
[2985.16 --> 2986.16]  For each one of us
[2986.16 --> 2989.16]  And we are so thankful, Lord
[2990.16 --> 2992.16]  And if we don't think about that enough
[2992.16 --> 2993.16]  Lord, convict us
[2994.16 --> 2995.16]  So that we do
[2996.16 --> 2997.16]  And then when we think of these fish
[2998.16 --> 2999.16]  On the walls up here
[3000.16 --> 3002.16]  We see many that have been affected by
[3003.16 --> 3005.16]  Your gift on the cross
[3005.16 --> 3008.16]  And then we see a whole bunch more that haven't yet
[3009.16 --> 3010.16]  Lord, will you call each one
[3011.16 --> 3012.16]  Even the ones that are
[3013.16 --> 3014.16]  Quite a ways away
[3015.16 --> 3016.16]  Away in this world
[3016.16 --> 3017.16]  Just swimming about
[3018.16 --> 3019.16]  Doing whatever
[3020.16 --> 3022.16]  Lord, will you convict each one
[3023.16 --> 3024.16]  Lord, we pray for our local
[3025.16 --> 3026.16]  Church
[3027.16 --> 3028.16]  For everyone here
[3029.16 --> 3030.16]  Lord, there's so many people
[3030.16 --> 3031.16]  You've already called home
[3031.16 --> 3032.16]  In the last little while
[3032.16 --> 3035.16]  And we want to pray for
[3036.16 --> 3038.16]  The people that are left behind, Lord
[3039.16 --> 3041.16]  Lord, we know you called them home
[3042.16 --> 3043.16]  But they left us
[3044.16 --> 3045.16]  There's an empty spot
[3046.16 --> 3049.16]  Help us to manage day to day
[3050.16 --> 3051.16]  Help us to
[3052.16 --> 3053.16]  Trust and obey, Lord
[3054.16 --> 3056.16]  Lord, we pray for each one of us
[3057.16 --> 3059.16]  Whether we are at home working
[3059.16 --> 3061.16]  Working in an office
[3062.16 --> 3063.16]  Working wherever
[3064.16 --> 3065.16]  Going to school
[3065.16 --> 3066.16]  Pray for the teachers, Lord
[3067.16 --> 3068.16]  Lord, we pray for
[3069.16 --> 3070.16]  Our municipality
[3071.16 --> 3072.16]  Our leaders
[3072.16 --> 3073.16]  Whether they be local, provincial
[3074.16 --> 3075.16]  Or federal
[3076.16 --> 3077.16]  And then we pray for the bigger world, Lord
[3078.16 --> 3079.16]  There's so much stuff
[3080.16 --> 3081.16]  That's happening
[3082.16 --> 3083.16]  Lord, we know and acknowledge you
[3083.16 --> 3084.16]  We're in total control
[3085.16 --> 3086.16]  Sometimes we don't understand why
[3086.16 --> 3088.16]  Things happen as they do
[3089.16 --> 3091.16]  Lord, we pray that you come back
[3092.16 --> 3093.16]  Soon
[3093.16 --> 3094.16]  And you call each one
[3095.16 --> 3096.16]  Who has not
[3097.16 --> 3098.16]  Acknowledged your call yet
[3099.16 --> 3100.16]  We pray, Lord, will you be with
[3101.16 --> 3102.16]  Pastor Chris as he
[3103.16 --> 3104.16]  Shures your word
[3105.16 --> 3106.16]  We pray that you give each one of us
[3107.16 --> 3109.16]  An open ear, mind and heart
[3110.16 --> 3111.16]  And not only that we listen
[3111.16 --> 3112.16]  But that we
[3113.16 --> 3114.16]  Leave here and live it
[3114.16 --> 3116.16]  Thank you, Lord
[3116.16 --> 3117.16]  In Jesus' name we pray
[3117.16 --> 3118.16]  Amen
[3137.16 --> 3142.16]  We have been in an ongoing series in the book of Romans
[3142.16 --> 3146.16]  We continue that this morning in Romans 12
[3147.16 --> 3149.16]  Verses 9 through 21
[3150.16 --> 3152.16]  That will be on the screen behind me
[3153.16 --> 3154.16]  The first time we go through it
[3155.16 --> 3156.16]  But as always, I encourage you to
[3157.16 --> 3158.16]  Have a Bible in your hands
[3158.16 --> 3159.16]  Whether it's on your device
[3160.16 --> 3161.16]  Or if you brought one
[3162.16 --> 3163.16]  Great, there are a few at the back as well
[3164.16 --> 3165.16]  There's some large print and some other
[3166.16 --> 3167.16]  Bibles back there
[3167.16 --> 3168.16]  You can grab one from there
[3169.16 --> 3171.16]  To help you in following along
[3172.16 --> 3176.16]  Let's begin by reading God's word together
[3177.16 --> 3178.16]  To us, Romans 12
[3179.16 --> 3180.16]  Starting at verse 9
[3183.16 --> 3185.16]  Love must be sincere
[3186.16 --> 3187.16]  Hate what is evil
[3188.16 --> 3189.16]  Cling to what is good
[3190.16 --> 3192.16]  Be devoted to one another in love
[3193.16 --> 3194.16]  Honor one another above yourselves
[3195.16 --> 3196.16]  Never be lacking in zeal
[3196.16 --> 3197.16]  Be lacking in zeal
[3197.16 --> 3199.16]  But keep your spiritual fervor
[3200.16 --> 3201.16]  Serving the Lord
[3203.16 --> 3204.16]  Be joyful in hope
[3205.16 --> 3207.16]  Patient in affliction
[3208.16 --> 3209.16]  Faithful in prayer
[3210.16 --> 3212.16]  Share with the Lord's people who are in need
[3213.16 --> 3214.16]  Practice hospitality
[3215.16 --> 3217.16]  Bless those who persecute you
[3218.16 --> 3219.16]  Bless and do not curse
[3220.16 --> 3221.16]  Rejoice with those who rejoice
[3221.16 --> 3223.16]  Mourn with those who mourn
[3224.16 --> 3225.16]  Live in harmony with one another
[3226.16 --> 3227.16]  Do not be proud
[3228.16 --> 3230.16]  But be willing to associate with people of low position
[3231.16 --> 3232.16]  Do not be conceited
[3233.16 --> 3236.16]  Do not repay anyone evil for evil
[3237.16 --> 3240.16]  Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone
[3240.16 --> 3243.16]  If it is possible, as far as it depends on you
[3244.16 --> 3246.16]  Live at peace with everyone
[3247.16 --> 3249.16]  Do not take revenge, my dear friends
[3250.16 --> 3251.16]  But leave room for God's wrath
[3252.16 --> 3254.16]  For it is written, it is mine to avenge
[3255.16 --> 3256.16]  I will repay, says the Lord
[3257.16 --> 3260.16]  On the contrary, if your enemy is hungry, feed him
[3261.16 --> 3263.16]  If he is thirsty, give him something to drink
[3264.16 --> 3266.16]  In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head
[3266.16 --> 3269.16]  Do not be overcome by evil
[3270.16 --> 3273.16]  But overcome evil with good
[3274.16 --> 3275.16]  This is the word of the Lord
[3276.16 --> 3288.16]  I debated this week if I was going to start this way
[3289.16 --> 3291.16]  But I am sensing that we must
[3291.16 --> 3292.16]  That we must
[3294.16 --> 3297.16]  This chapter, I hope you will see
[3298.16 --> 3299.16]  Paints a compelling picture
[3300.16 --> 3302.16]  Of what it means to be part of the Christian community
[3303.16 --> 3305.16]  What it means to belong to the church
[3306.16 --> 3307.16]  To the body of Christ
[3308.16 --> 3309.16]  But the reality is
[3310.16 --> 3312.16]  That so many of us
[3313.16 --> 3315.16]  Don't see that picture
[3316.16 --> 3319.16]  Or don't start from that place of compelling comparison
[3319.16 --> 3325.16]  And so I want to share a little bit of my own story
[3326.16 --> 3327.16]  My own testimony
[3327.16 --> 3329.16]  And some of you have heard bits and pieces of it
[3330.16 --> 3334.16]  But my very first memory of church
[3335.16 --> 3337.16]  Is from when I was five years old
[3338.16 --> 3340.16]  So there is little Chris
[3341.16 --> 3343.16]  Five years old, sitting beside his mom and dad
[3344.16 --> 3346.16]  Who are not here today, so they don't know I am telling this story
[3346.16 --> 3348.16]  But, and on the other side of my mom and dad
[3349.16 --> 3351.16]  Are my grandpa and my grandma
[3352.16 --> 3353.16]  And my grandfather
[3354.16 --> 3357.16]  A stalwart man of faith
[3358.16 --> 3359.16]  If ever there was one
[3360.16 --> 3361.16]  He could be contrarian
[3362.16 --> 3363.16]  We all knew that
[3364.16 --> 3367.16]  But, that Sunday morning
[3368.16 --> 3369.16]  And I remember this clearly
[3370.16 --> 3371.16]  The pastor stood up in that church
[3372.16 --> 3373.16]  Behind the pulpit
[3373.16 --> 3374.16]  Behind the pulpit
[3375.16 --> 3377.16]  And with all his bravado
[3378.16 --> 3379.16]  Said
[3380.16 --> 3381.16]  Harold Campin
[3382.16 --> 3383.16]  That's my grandpa
[3384.16 --> 3386.16]  Has disagreed with the decision of our church council
[3387.16 --> 3391.16]  And has been kicked out of office
[3392.16 --> 3397.16]  The church was going through some pretty hard times
[3398.16 --> 3399.16]  This is the mid-80s
[3399.16 --> 3403.16]  And there were some pretty significant conversations happening in that church
[3404.16 --> 3406.16]  My grandfather didn't agree with the pastor
[3407.16 --> 3409.16]  My grandfather was on council
[3410.16 --> 3412.16]  And my grandfather was a man of integrity
[3413.16 --> 3414.16]  And so he let the pastor know
[3415.16 --> 3418.16]  The pastor didn't like that he was disagreed with
[3419.16 --> 3421.16]  And so that Sunday he stood in the pulpit
[3422.16 --> 3423.16]  And he called him out by name
[3424.16 --> 3426.16]  And what I remember is my grandfather standing up
[3427.16 --> 3429.16]  Nodding his head to the pastor
[3430.16 --> 3432.16]  My grandmother standing up beside him
[3433.16 --> 3434.16]  Weeping
[3435.16 --> 3436.16]  And walking out of church
[3437.16 --> 3438.16]  They never went back to that church
[3439.16 --> 3443.16]  My first memory of church
[3444.16 --> 3446.16]  Is an instance
[3447.16 --> 3448.16]  Of pastoral abuse
[3448.16 --> 3449.16]  My first memory of church
[3449.16 --> 3452.16]  My first memory of church is not this compelling image of love being sincere
[3453.16 --> 3454.16]  But a broken one
[3455.16 --> 3456.16]  Fast forward three years
[3457.16 --> 3458.16]  My second memory of church
[3459.16 --> 3460.16]  We have now moved to churches as well
[3461.16 --> 3462.16]  I'm in the cadet program at this church
[3463.16 --> 3465.16]  So I'm eight years old
[3465.16 --> 3466.16]  First year in cadets
[3466.16 --> 3467.16]  First year in cadets
[3468.16 --> 3469.16]  We're going to Alliston, Ontario
[3469.16 --> 3470.16]  Where there's a Honda production facility
[3471.16 --> 3472.16]  So a bunch of boys, 30, 40 of us
[3473.16 --> 3474.16]  Being wrangled by seven or eight men
[3475.16 --> 3476.16]  To go on this tour of the production line
[3477.16 --> 3478.16]  At Honda
[3479.16 --> 3480.16]  And so I'm in the cadet program
[3481.16 --> 3482.16]  And so I'm in the cadet program
[3482.16 --> 3483.16]  And so I'm in the cadet program at this church
[3484.16 --> 3485.16]  So I'm in the cadet program at this church
[3486.16 --> 3487.16]  So I'm eight years old
[3488.16 --> 3489.16]  First year in cadets
[3490.16 --> 3491.16]  We're going to Alliston, Ontario
[3491.16 --> 3494.16]  To go on this tour of the production line
[3494.16 --> 3495.16]  At Honda Alliston
[3496.16 --> 3498.16]  As we were approaching the doors
[3498.16 --> 3499.16]  The counselors there
[3499.16 --> 3500.16]  One of them turned around
[3500.16 --> 3501.16]  And said, okay boys
[3501.16 --> 3502.16]  When we get in the building
[3503.16 --> 3504.16]  Stop talking
[3504.16 --> 3505.16]  Start listening
[3506.16 --> 3507.16]  Before we got to the door
[3508.16 --> 3509.16]  I hadn't yet walked in
[3510.16 --> 3511.16]  I was still talking
[3511.16 --> 3512.16]  The counselor turned around
[3512.16 --> 3513.16]  And he smacked me across the face
[3514.16 --> 3519.16]  My second memory of church
[3519.16 --> 3522.16]  Is an instance of abuse
[3523.16 --> 3527.16]  And so
[3528.16 --> 3529.16]  In a moment
[3530.16 --> 3532.16]  When we dig into this really beautiful picture
[3533.16 --> 3536.16]  When we cast for us
[3537.16 --> 3538.16]  What God has possible
[3539.16 --> 3540.16]  And for us in display
[3541.16 --> 3543.16]  Please don't hear that from me
[3544.16 --> 3545.16]  With my head in the clouds
[3545.16 --> 3548.16]  Or ignorant of the realities
[3549.16 --> 3550.16]  That all of us in some way shape or form
[3551.16 --> 3552.16]  Have faced and experienced
[3553.16 --> 3554.16]  If you know my story
[3555.16 --> 3556.16]  I took a long circuitous route
[3557.16 --> 3559.16]  Back to an experience of faith and Jesus
[3560.16 --> 3561.16]  In part because of those two images
[3562.16 --> 3563.16]  No doubt
[3564.16 --> 3565.16]  Those two stories
[3568.16 --> 3571.16]  But it is my deep prayer this morning
[3571.16 --> 3574.16]  That as we look at what is possible
[3575.16 --> 3578.16]  As we look at what God has available for us
[3579.16 --> 3580.16]  We would do so
[3581.16 --> 3583.16]  With the reality of everything we have experienced
[3584.16 --> 3585.16]  And the hurt that we bring
[3586.16 --> 3588.16]  But also with hope for what's possible
[3589.16 --> 3592.16]  Now my prayer continues
[3593.16 --> 3596.16]  That what we will see
[3596.16 --> 3598.16]  And what we have been seeing
[3599.16 --> 3600.16]  These last few weeks together
[3601.16 --> 3602.16]  Is that one of the things
[3603.16 --> 3605.16]  That Christianity is all about
[3606.16 --> 3607.16]  And I mean really about
[3608.16 --> 3610.16]  Is redefining relationships
[3611.16 --> 3612.16]  Right? Christianity is about
[3613.16 --> 3614.16]  Redefining relationships
[3615.16 --> 3617.16]  First, it's about redefining your relationship to God
[3618.16 --> 3619.16]  In Christ Jesus
[3620.16 --> 3622.16]  And then it's about redefining your relationships
[3622.16 --> 3623.16]  To those people around you
[3623.16 --> 3624.16]  Who are part of the body
[3625.16 --> 3626.16]  For us here today
[3627.16 --> 3628.16]  And then lastly
[3629.16 --> 3631.16]  It's about redefining our relationships
[3632.16 --> 3633.16]  To the world
[3634.16 --> 3636.16]  And to those who do not yet know Christ
[3639.16 --> 3640.16]  Now this idea
[3641.16 --> 3642.16]  Right? This process
[3643.16 --> 3644.16]  Builds off of what Pastor Kevin talked about
[3645.16 --> 3646.16]  Last week about being part of the body
[3647.16 --> 3650.16]  Right? Christianity at its core
[3650.16 --> 3653.16]  Is a relational religion
[3654.16 --> 3657.16]  Right? Everything that God has done in the world
[3658.16 --> 3659.16]  Both in creating and redeeming it
[3660.16 --> 3664.16]  Is to have relationship with his creatures
[3665.16 --> 3668.16]  And that is because God is within himself
[3669.16 --> 3670.16]  A relational God
[3671.16 --> 3674.16]  Right? The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
[3675.16 --> 3676.16]  Have lived eternally together
[3676.16 --> 3679.16]  In a relationship of mutual recognition
[3680.16 --> 3681.16]  And support and submission
[3682.16 --> 3683.16]  A relationship of self-giving love
[3684.16 --> 3686.16]  A relationship of other-raising worship
[3687.16 --> 3689.16]  And we now as created in his image
[3690.16 --> 3694.16]  Are called to live into that inner Trinitarian union
[3695.16 --> 3696.16]  That inner Trinitarian relationship
[3697.16 --> 3699.16]  That's what redemption from sin is
[3700.16 --> 3701.16]  When we talk about sin in the church
[3701.16 --> 3704.16]  At root we are talking about a broken relationship
[3704.16 --> 3705.16]  To God, our Creator
[3706.16 --> 3709.16]  And the way that that affects everything else
[3710.16 --> 3713.16]  Right? Sin is a destroying of a relationship to God
[3714.16 --> 3716.16]  A breaking of a relationship to God
[3717.16 --> 3718.16]  And redemption then
[3719.16 --> 3720.16]  Is union with Christ
[3721.16 --> 3722.16]  And in union with Christ
[3723.16 --> 3726.16]  Being restored to that inner Trinitarian union
[3726.16 --> 3729.16]  And fellowship that we were created to be part of
[3730.16 --> 3732.16]  To image to the world
[3733.16 --> 3735.16]  And in many ways
[3736.16 --> 3737.16]  That first half of the book of Romans
[3738.16 --> 3744.16]  Is about how we are restored to personal covenantal relationship to God
[3745.16 --> 3747.16]  Right? Chapters 1 through 11
[3748.16 --> 3749.16]  It's important to note
[3750.16 --> 3753.16]  Right? That this is about how we come back to God
[3753.16 --> 3756.16]  By God coming down to us
[3757.16 --> 3761.16]  And this relationship is personal and covenantal
[3762.16 --> 3766.16]  Right? So covenantal relationships are always communal
[3767.16 --> 3770.16]  And we saw that particularly in baptism this morning
[3771.16 --> 3772.16]  Right? In Sadie's baptism
[3773.16 --> 3774.16]  We mark her as a child of the covenant
[3775.16 --> 3776.16]  And we, the community of faith
[3777.16 --> 3780.16]  Both acknowledge that truth and welcome her into it
[3780.16 --> 3784.16]  And we raise her up together as part of us
[3785.16 --> 3787.16]  She needs us and we need her
[3788.16 --> 3791.16]  And this redefining of relationship in the body
[3792.16 --> 3795.16]  Is now where Paul picks up in Romans 12
[3796.16 --> 3804.16]  Right? Remember Romans 12 is following and is built upon the reality of Romans 1 through 11
[3804.16 --> 3808.16]  It's built upon the truth that we are justified
[3809.16 --> 3810.16]  That we are saved
[3811.16 --> 3813.16]  That salvation comes only by grace alone
[3814.16 --> 3815.16]  Through faith alone in Christ alone
[3816.16 --> 3818.16]  So that we are now no longer alone
[3819.16 --> 3820.16]  Because of our union with Christ
[3821.16 --> 3822.16]  And our relationship to God
[3823.16 --> 3824.16]  And our communion with the body
[3825.16 --> 3826.16]  With each other
[3827.16 --> 3829.16]  Now in the section that we read
[3829.16 --> 3830.16]  This morning
[3830.16 --> 3833.16]  There are loosely two sections
[3834.16 --> 3836.16]  And there's some overlapping and transitional words
[3837.16 --> 3839.16]  But for the sake of our teaching this morning
[3840.16 --> 3841.16]  There's two sections
[3842.16 --> 3844.16]  The first section is verse 9 through 16
[3845.16 --> 3849.16]  And that refers primarily to relationships within the body
[3850.16 --> 3854.16]  Relationships among the language that defines these two things together
[3854.16 --> 3855.16]  Is among one another
[3856.16 --> 3858.16]  You will see that repeated through those sections
[3859.16 --> 3860.16]  One another
[3861.16 --> 3864.16]  The second section is 17 to the end
[3865.16 --> 3868.16]  And that generally is held together by the use of the phrase everyone
[3869.16 --> 3873.16]  And refers to relationships outside of this body
[3874.16 --> 3875.16]  Or to the relationships to the world
[3876.16 --> 3877.16]  Now like I said these distinctions aren't perfect
[3878.16 --> 3880.16]  But we're going to hold them
[3880.16 --> 3883.16]  And recognize that even though they're porous
[3884.16 --> 3885.16]  And there's some shifting
[3886.16 --> 3889.16]  That's going to help us frame our discussion together this morning
[3890.16 --> 3892.16]  And so track with me, right?
[3893.16 --> 3894.16]  First is your relationship to God
[3895.16 --> 3896.16]  That's the foundation of Romans 1-11
[3897.16 --> 3900.16]  That's summarized here at the beginning of chapter 12
[3901.16 --> 3903.16]  With the phrase, therefore, in view of God's mercy
[3904.16 --> 3907.16]  Right? And then, out of that relationship with God
[3907.16 --> 3910.16]  There are your relationships to others around you in the body
[3911.16 --> 3915.16]  And then three, your relationships to everyone else
[3916.16 --> 3918.16]  And so first, in the body
[3919.16 --> 3921.16]  Paul starts by saying
[3922.16 --> 3924.16]  Love must be sincere
[3925.16 --> 3927.16]  Hate what is evil
[3928.16 --> 3930.16]  Cling to what is good
[3931.16 --> 3934.16]  First we're told that love must be sincere
[3934.16 --> 3936.16]  Now literally in the Greek
[3937.16 --> 3938.16]  The original language this was written in
[3939.16 --> 3942.16]  It says, love unhypocritically
[3943.16 --> 3945.16]  Now one of the challenges of this verse
[3946.16 --> 3948.16]  Is that loving unhypocritically
[3949.16 --> 3952.16]  At least to me, seems really hard to do
[3953.16 --> 3954.16]  Maybe even impossible
[3955.16 --> 3956.16]  In fact, right?
[3957.16 --> 3958.16]  One of the biggest criticisms
[3959.16 --> 3961.16]  And the most regularly lobbed criticisms
[3961.16 --> 3963.16]  Towards Christians
[3964.16 --> 3965.16]  Is that we are hypocrites
[3966.16 --> 3967.16]  Right?
[3968.16 --> 3969.16]  We preach love
[3970.16 --> 3973.16]  And yet, we call out an individual by name
[3974.16 --> 3975.16]  When they disagree with us
[3976.16 --> 3978.16]  We preach honor and respect
[3979.16 --> 3981.16]  And yet, we smack a kid
[3982.16 --> 3983.16]  When he doesn't listen
[3983.16 --> 3984.16]  As you're going into the Honda plant
[3984.16 --> 3985.16]  We preach obedience to Christ
[3985.16 --> 3986.16]  And we act disobediently
[3987.16 --> 3988.16]  We profess to be content
[3989.16 --> 3990.16]  Whatever the circumstances
[3991.16 --> 3993.16]  And yet, our anxieties and our idolatries
[3994.16 --> 3997.16]  Are just as prevalent and high as everyone else's
[3998.16 --> 4002.16]  It's easy to become a Pharisee
[4003.16 --> 4006.16]  And if you know what I mean when I say that
[4007.16 --> 4009.16]  You're in danger of becoming a Pharisee
[4009.16 --> 4011.16]  Because that's the reality
[4012.16 --> 4013.16]  For those of us who are familiar
[4014.16 --> 4018.16]  With this way of being in the world
[4019.16 --> 4022.16]  Now let me hear it
[4023.16 --> 4024.16]  Let me say it very clearly
[4025.16 --> 4026.16]  I am a hypocrite
[4027.16 --> 4029.16]  Or let me put it more accurately
[4030.16 --> 4031.16]  I act hypocritically
[4032.16 --> 4034.16]  But by the grace of God
[4035.16 --> 4036.16]  I am not a hypocrite
[4036.16 --> 4038.16]  At least not any longer
[4039.16 --> 4041.16]  I'm no longer defined by my hypocrisy
[4042.16 --> 4043.16]  Right? It's still there
[4043.16 --> 4044.16]  It's still part of me
[4044.16 --> 4045.16]  And I'm waging war against it
[4046.16 --> 4047.16]  But by the grace of God
[4048.16 --> 4049.16]  Right? That ought to be the difference
[4050.16 --> 4052.16]  For all of us who profess to believe
[4053.16 --> 4055.16]  Yes, we still act hypocritically
[4056.16 --> 4059.16]  But we're trying
[4060.16 --> 4061.16]  By the grace of God
[4062.16 --> 4063.16]  To be transformed
[4063.16 --> 4064.16]  And so then
[4064.16 --> 4065.16]  What does it mean
[4065.16 --> 4067.16]  To love unhypocritically?
[4069.16 --> 4070.16]  I think the best way to put this
[4071.16 --> 4072.16]  And to understand it
[4072.16 --> 4073.16]  Is to love genuinely
[4074.16 --> 4075.16]  Or authentically
[4076.16 --> 4077.16]  And even as I say that
[4077.16 --> 4078.16]  I know some of you are like
[4079.16 --> 4080.16]  I hate those words
[4081.16 --> 4082.16]  Right? Like they're buzz words
[4083.16 --> 4084.16]  What does that even mean?
[4084.16 --> 4085.16]  And so let me give you an example
[4086.16 --> 4088.16]  To love unhypocritically
[4089.16 --> 4091.16]  Means that when I have a conversation
[4091.16 --> 4092.16]  With someone
[4092.16 --> 4094.16]  They walk away from that conversation
[4095.16 --> 4096.16]  Feeling like they got the real me
[4097.16 --> 4099.16]  Like I wasn't wearing a mask
[4100.16 --> 4102.16]  Like I wasn't putting my best self forward
[4103.16 --> 4104.16]  Or like I wasn't holding things back
[4105.16 --> 4106.16]  That I truly genuinely believe
[4107.16 --> 4108.16]  But I'm compromising on
[4109.16 --> 4110.16]  Because I'm risking the
[4111.16 --> 4112.16]  I'm at risk of the relationship
[4113.16 --> 4114.16]  Right? When someone engages with me
[4114.16 --> 4116.16]  I want them to walk away
[4117.16 --> 4119.16]  Feeling like they were seen by me
[4120.16 --> 4123.16]  Right? All of who you are
[4124.16 --> 4127.16]  Even as we lay ourselves open
[4128.16 --> 4129.16]  And honestly bare before each other
[4130.16 --> 4131.16]  I want there to be a sense of safety
[4132.16 --> 4133.16]  In the midst of that
[4134.16 --> 4135.16]  Even as we talk about things
[4136.16 --> 4137.16]  That make us uncomfortable
[4138.16 --> 4139.16]  Even as I ask you hard questions
[4140.16 --> 4141.16]  Or you ask me hard questions
[4141.16 --> 4142.16]  I want you to leave going
[4142.16 --> 4143.16]  You know what?
[4143.16 --> 4145.16]  I think he really is for me
[4146.16 --> 4148.16]  I think that's what it means to love
[4149.16 --> 4150.16]  Unhypocritically
[4151.16 --> 4153.16]  And I'm going to stress this point to you
[4154.16 --> 4156.16]  Because it's really easy in our churches
[4157.16 --> 4158.16]  And in our Christian communities
[4159.16 --> 4160.16]  For there to be a sense
[4161.16 --> 4162.16]  Or a veneer that develops
[4163.16 --> 4165.16]  Right? A cover over the reality
[4165.16 --> 4168.16]  Sometimes we present our best selves to each other
[4169.16 --> 4172.16]  And we hide the truth of who we are
[4173.16 --> 4175.16]  Sometimes in churches
[4176.16 --> 4177.16]  Right? There's a culture of niceness
[4178.16 --> 4179.16]  Or politeness that develops
[4180.16 --> 4181.16]  That actually becomes a wall
[4182.16 --> 4183.16]  Or a barrier around the truth of our hearts
[4184.16 --> 4185.16]  And the struggles of our circumstances
[4186.16 --> 4188.16]  And we pretend to be okay
[4189.16 --> 4192.16]  Because risking being vulnerable is just too much
[4192.16 --> 4196.16]  And again, remember my story from the beginning
[4197.16 --> 4200.16]  To be fair, some of us have been burned by the church
[4201.16 --> 4203.16]  Have been burned by being vulnerable
[4208.16 --> 4209.16]  Sometimes
[4210.16 --> 4213.16]  We are really good at being pleasant to someone's face
[4214.16 --> 4215.16]  And then venomous
[4216.16 --> 4218.16]  In the other corner of the foyer
[4219.16 --> 4220.16]  With our gossip
[4220.16 --> 4225.16]  An unhypocritical love
[4226.16 --> 4227.16]  A sincere love
[4228.16 --> 4230.16]  Calls us to be vulnerable
[4231.16 --> 4233.16]  It's risky
[4234.16 --> 4235.16]  You better believe it
[4235.16 --> 4236.16]  It's risky
[4236.16 --> 4237.16]  But when you experience it
[4238.16 --> 4239.16]  Oh my goodness
[4240.16 --> 4241.16]  It is good
[4242.16 --> 4244.16]  It is so good
[4245.16 --> 4246.16]  And not only then
[4247.16 --> 4248.16]  Must we love unhypocritically
[4248.16 --> 4249.16]  But
[4249.16 --> 4250.16]  Paul continues
[4251.16 --> 4252.16]  One of the ways we do that
[4252.16 --> 4253.16]  Is by hating what is evil
[4254.16 --> 4256.16]  And clinging to what is good
[4257.16 --> 4260.16]  And this is a really important thing for us to hear
[4261.16 --> 4262.16]  Because often times
[4263.16 --> 4265.16]  Love in our world today
[4266.16 --> 4270.16]  Is characterized as just affirming everything about everyone
[4271.16 --> 4274.16]  And let me be really, really clear here
[4274.16 --> 4275.16]  That's not real love
[4276.16 --> 4277.16]  That's not real love
[4278.16 --> 4279.16]  Right?
[4279.16 --> 4280.16]  Real love requires that we hate
[4281.16 --> 4285.16]  That we are horrified by what God calls evil
[4286.16 --> 4290.16]  Real love calls us to cling to what is good
[4291.16 --> 4294.16]  And look, there is a temptation that when you love someone
[4294.16 --> 4295.16]  Right?
[4295.16 --> 4297.16]  You want to just give them what makes them feel happy
[4297.16 --> 4300.16]  You want to feed or fill their emotional joy
[4301.16 --> 4303.16]  Rather than give them what's best
[4304.16 --> 4308.16]  And in part, that's because it's easier
[4309.16 --> 4310.16]  Right?
[4310.16 --> 4311.16]  It keeps the peace in our relationship
[4312.16 --> 4315.16]  But also because like we genuinely do want them to feel best
[4316.16 --> 4317.16]  Right?
[4317.16 --> 4318.16]  We should
[4319.16 --> 4320.16]  But here's the thing, right?
[4320.16 --> 4321.16]  True love
[4322.16 --> 4325.16]  Is built upon the truth of God's word
[4326.16 --> 4329.16]  And God's word reveals how we were designed to live
[4330.16 --> 4331.16]  And the truth is then
[4332.16 --> 4335.16]  That God himself gets to define love
[4336.16 --> 4337.16]  Right?
[4337.16 --> 4338.16]  When we say God is love
[4339.16 --> 4341.16]  Part of what that means is he gets to tell us what real love is
[4342.16 --> 4346.16]  And it's our best response to listen first
[4348.16 --> 4351.16]  Right? To disobey God's design for our life together
[4352.16 --> 4355.16]  Is always going to be bad for the people we love
[4356.16 --> 4359.16]  Real love is concerned for the truth
[4360.16 --> 4364.16]  And any love that is unwilling to confront a lie
[4365.16 --> 4366.16]  Is not real love
[4367.16 --> 4369.16]  But instead, I'm going to name it as a selfish desire to keep the peace
[4370.16 --> 4371.16]  Because it's easier
[4371.16 --> 4372.16]  Because it's easier
[4375.16 --> 4379.16]  But when you see someone who's hurting because of the choices they're making
[4380.16 --> 4382.16]  Real love requires you to confront them
[4384.16 --> 4390.16]  Now, if you do, remember, you act hypocritically
[4390.16 --> 4391.16]  And so confront them
[4392.16 --> 4393.16]  Out of your own sincerity
[4394.16 --> 4402.16]  Confront them out of your own journey into truth
[4403.16 --> 4406.16]  And also, I want to name this point
[4407.16 --> 4408.16]  Because it's important to pause
[4409.16 --> 4411.16]  And to remember that what we are talking about here
[4412.16 --> 4414.16]  Is relationships within the body
[4414.16 --> 4418.16]  We're talking about Christian to Christian here
[4419.16 --> 4423.16]  Right? This isn't a call for you to go out to your unbelieving friends
[4424.16 --> 4428.16]  And point out the truth of the untruth of their lives
[4429.16 --> 4432.16]  Right? This isn't a call for you to go stand on a soapbox somewhere
[4432.16 --> 4434.16]  And expect unbelieving people
[4435.16 --> 4436.16]  Unconverted to Christ people
[4437.16 --> 4439.16]  To behave like converted to Christ people
[4440.16 --> 4441.16]  They're two different things
[4442.16 --> 4443.16]  Two different categories
[4444.16 --> 4450.16]  Right? We need the Holy Spirit to make us able to live as God has called us to live
[4451.16 --> 4455.16]  And so this part of the conversation is body member to body member
[4456.16 --> 4457.16]  Christian to Christian
[4457.16 --> 4465.16]  All of this presumes a profession of faith based and in response to the grace of God given
[4472.16 --> 4474.16]  Paul continues talking to the body
[4475.16 --> 4478.16]  And he says, be devoted to one another in love
[4479.16 --> 4480.16]  Honor one another above yourselves
[4481.16 --> 4485.16]  This is the foundation of humility that shapes the body that Pastor Kevin talked about
[4485.16 --> 4489.16]  And that we continue to talking about in our podcast this past week
[4490.16 --> 4493.16]  Shameless plug available every Wednesday at 5 a.m.
[4494.16 --> 4495.16]  Welcome to the narthex
[4496.16 --> 4500.16]  That foundation of humility leads into the body
[4501.16 --> 4504.16]  And then Paul goes, never be lacking in zeal
[4505.16 --> 4507.16]  But keep your spiritual fervor serving the Lord
[4508.16 --> 4512.16]  Literally there in Greek it says, be set on fire by the Spirit
[4512.16 --> 4518.16]  And I think what that means is that Christians ought to be a people of passion
[4519.16 --> 4521.16]  Right? I will never understand the Christian
[4522.16 --> 4524.16]  And I'm going to be honest, it's usually a man, right?
[4525.16 --> 4526.16]  Who is stoic
[4527.16 --> 4528.16]  And borderline slightly angry all the time
[4529.16 --> 4531.16]  Keeping their hands firmly placed in their pockets
[4532.16 --> 4534.16]  While the people around them are singing with joy on their faces
[4535.16 --> 4537.16]  Right? Or when the preacher is up at the front
[4537.16 --> 4539.16]  Sitting back with their arms crossed
[4540.16 --> 4541.16]  Like, no, you haven't won me over yet
[4542.16 --> 4543.16]  I saw a few of you uncross your arms right there
[4544.16 --> 4545.16]  Yup
[4548.16 --> 4549.16]  Where is your zeal?
[4550.16 --> 4552.16]  And let me be really clear
[4553.16 --> 4556.16]  When I say zeal, I don't mean happy, clappy, and excited
[4557.16 --> 4558.16]  Right? I'm not asking everyone to look the same
[4559.16 --> 4562.16]  And to paint the same brush in our worshiping life
[4562.16 --> 4567.16]  What I'm saying is, right? Your zeal means you need to have a real relationship to God
[4568.16 --> 4569.16]  And to the body
[4570.16 --> 4572.16]  Right? Don't settle for anything less than what's real
[4573.16 --> 4577.16]  And let's be honest too, right? Without a real relationship
[4578.16 --> 4579.16]  All of this is meaningless
[4582.16 --> 4584.16]  And I think we can say pretty confidently on the truth of the Bible
[4584.16 --> 4587.16]  That without a real relationship to God and to the body
[4588.16 --> 4591.16]  All of life, in fact, is meaningless
[4592.16 --> 4594.16]  And what I mean by that is that it's fleeting
[4595.16 --> 4596.16]  It's a chasing after the wind
[4597.16 --> 4598.16]  It's a grasping after breath
[4599.16 --> 4600.16]  And the moment you finally lay hold to something
[4601.16 --> 4603.16]  You open your hands to look at it and you realize that it's gone
[4604.16 --> 4606.16]  And that it wasn't worth what you thought it was
[4607.16 --> 4610.16]  And it didn't satisfy in the way that you hoped it would
[4610.16 --> 4612.16]  Instead
[4613.16 --> 4615.16]  Be joyful in hope
[4616.16 --> 4618.16]  Patient in affliction
[4619.16 --> 4620.16]  And faithful in prayer
[4621.16 --> 4623.16]  Share with the Lord's people who are in need
[4624.16 --> 4625.16]  Practice hospitality
[4628.16 --> 4633.16]  Now, I want to pause for a second
[4634.16 --> 4636.16]  And I want to ask you to dig deep
[4636.16 --> 4641.16]  There's a thing going on in this text that I think is absolutely fascinating
[4642.16 --> 4645.16]  And I hope I can communicate it well enough so that you can see it
[4646.16 --> 4650.16]  But on this phrase, practice hospitality
[4651.16 --> 4654.16]  And so let's dig here for just a moment
[4655.16 --> 4659.16]  The word translated practice means something more like pursue
[4660.16 --> 4663.16]  Or it means to honestly and earnestly endeavor
[4663.16 --> 4664.16]  Ever
[4665.16 --> 4667.16]  Right? And so sometimes you will hear people talking about
[4668.16 --> 4669.16]  The gift of hospitality
[4670.16 --> 4672.16]  Right? And what we mean by that usually
[4673.16 --> 4674.16]  Is that there are people who are just good at it
[4675.16 --> 4677.16]  Right? Who seem to love hosting
[4678.16 --> 4680.16]  Who seem to love cooking for people
[4681.16 --> 4683.16]  And sharing with them is their love language
[4684.16 --> 4687.16]  In fact, I love cooking for people
[4687.16 --> 4692.16]  I love preparing elaborate and exorbitant meals for people
[4693.16 --> 4696.16]  But I want to be really clear
[4697.16 --> 4700.16]  Because who is Paul talking to in this text?
[4701.16 --> 4706.16]  Because it's not the quote, gift of hospitality people
[4707.16 --> 4712.16]  In fact, hospitality isn't even a gift
[4712.16 --> 4717.16]  Right? It's not in any of the gift lists in Scripture
[4718.16 --> 4720.16]  Right? There's gift lists here in Romans 12
[4721.16 --> 4722.16]  Kevin read them last week
[4723.16 --> 4724.16]  They include things like prophesying and serving
[4725.16 --> 4727.16]  Teaching, encouraging, giving, leading, and showing mercy
[4728.16 --> 4730.16]  There's another gift list in 1 Corinthians 12
[4731.16 --> 4732.16]  Where Paul adds to that list
[4733.16 --> 4735.16]  Gifts of wisdom and knowledge, faith, miraculous powers
[4736.16 --> 4738.16]  Gifts of healing, identifying spirits
[4738.16 --> 4740.16]  Gift of tongues and the gift of interpreting tongues
[4741.16 --> 4742.16]  Which are two different things
[4743.16 --> 4744.16]  In verse 28 of that chapter
[4744.16 --> 4746.16]  He adds the gift of helping and of guidance
[4747.16 --> 4748.16]  Now that last one
[4748.16 --> 4750.16]  That seems to be about administration
[4751.16 --> 4754.16]  And organizational gifts for the running of a church community
[4755.16 --> 4759.16]  But in all of those places where we get gift lists in Scripture
[4760.16 --> 4763.16]  Can I tell you what's conspicuously absent?
[4764.16 --> 4765.16]  Hospitality
[4765.16 --> 4766.16]  Hospitality
[4767.16 --> 4770.16]  And I think that's why it says we have to pursue it
[4771.16 --> 4774.16]  Right? We have to earnestly run after it
[4775.16 --> 4776.16]  We have to run it down
[4777.16 --> 4780.16]  Even when it's not part of our natural way of being in the world
[4781.16 --> 4784.16]  And I think the reason why that is the case
[4785.16 --> 4787.16]  And this is what I want you to see and dig deep into with me
[4788.16 --> 4791.16]  If you have a Bible in front of you
[4791.16 --> 4794.16]  This is a good time to look but it will be on the screen there
[4795.16 --> 4796.16]  Although if you have a Bible in front of you
[4797.16 --> 4798.16]  I'm going to be honest with you, it's not going to help you
[4798.16 --> 4800.16]  Because you would never see this in your English translation
[4801.16 --> 4806.16]  This little paragraph uses four different words for love
[4807.16 --> 4809.16]  To describe the way the body interacts together
[4810.16 --> 4814.16]  The first word for love that is used is in verse 9
[4814.16 --> 4816.16]  Love must be sincere
[4817.16 --> 4818.16]  That's agape
[4819.16 --> 4820.16]  Right?
[4820.16 --> 4823.16]  That's the word for love there is agape
[4824.16 --> 4826.16]  That's the same word that Paul uses to describe
[4827.16 --> 4829.16]  The love agape of Christ
[4830.16 --> 4832.16]  In Romans 8 verse 35
[4833.16 --> 4834.16]  And following he says
[4834.16 --> 4838.16]  Who shall separate us from the love agape of Christ
[4839.16 --> 4840.16]  And then he continues
[4841.16 --> 4843.16]  Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword
[4844.16 --> 4845.16]  He goes on
[4846.16 --> 4848.16]  For I am convinced that neither death nor life
[4849.16 --> 4850.16]  Neither angels nor demons
[4850.16 --> 4851.16]  Neither the present nor the future
[4852.16 --> 4854.16]  Nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else
[4855.16 --> 4856.16]  In all of creation
[4857.16 --> 4860.16]  Will be able to separate us from the love agape of God
[4860.16 --> 4863.16]  That is in Christ Jesus our Lord
[4864.16 --> 4867.16]  Right? It's the same word that Paul uses in Romans 5 verse 8
[4867.16 --> 4872.16]  When he says God demonstrates his own agape for us in this
[4873.16 --> 4876.16]  While we were still sinners, Christ died for us
[4877.16 --> 4880.16]  So sincere love in the body
[4881.16 --> 4885.16]  Is a reflection of the love of God in Jesus Christ
[4886.16 --> 4889.16]  For us spilling over through us to the body
[4890.16 --> 4892.16]  That's the first word
[4893.16 --> 4895.16]  The second word is in verse 10
[4896.16 --> 4899.16]  It says be devoted to one another in love
[4900.16 --> 4901.16]  Now did you see it?
[4902.16 --> 4904.16]  Now I bet you didn't
[4905.16 --> 4906.16]  Because it's not actually the phrase in love
[4909.16 --> 4911.16]  The word translated be devoted
[4912.16 --> 4914.16]  Is Philadelphia
[4915.16 --> 4917.16]  That's the compound of the word philos
[4917.16 --> 4918.16]  Which means love
[4918.16 --> 4919.16]  And adelphoi
[4920.16 --> 4921.16]  Which means brothers
[4921.16 --> 4922.16]  Love of brothers
[4922.16 --> 4923.16]  Or brotherly love
[4923.16 --> 4925.16]  That's why the city of Philadelphia
[4926.16 --> 4927.16]  Is called the city of brotherly love
[4928.16 --> 4929.16]  Because that's what the word means
[4930.16 --> 4933.16]  And so because of the agape love of Jesus
[4934.16 --> 4936.16]  We are made into brothers
[4937.16 --> 4938.16]  Right? First me to him
[4939.16 --> 4940.16]  And then you to him
[4941.16 --> 4944.16]  And then me to you
[4944.16 --> 4946.16]  And you to each other
[4947.16 --> 4950.16]  The body that Kevin talked about last week
[4951.16 --> 4952.16]  Is also called a family
[4953.16 --> 4956.16]  And remember this is back in Romans 8 again
[4957.16 --> 4958.16]  In verse 14
[4959.16 --> 4960.16]  And following
[4960.16 --> 4961.16]  Where Paul writes
[4961.16 --> 4963.16]  For those who are led by the Spirit of God
[4963.16 --> 4964.16]  Are children of God
[4965.16 --> 4966.16]  And the Spirit you received
[4966.16 --> 4968.16]  Brought about your adoption to sonship
[4969.16 --> 4970.16]  And by him we cry
[4971.16 --> 4972.16]  Abba, Father
[4973.16 --> 4974.16]  The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit
[4975.16 --> 4976.16]  That we are God's children
[4977.16 --> 4978.16]  Now if we are children
[4978.16 --> 4979.16]  Then we are heirs
[4979.16 --> 4980.16]  Heirs of God
[4980.16 --> 4982.16]  And co-heirs with Christ
[4983.16 --> 4984.16]  You see what's happening
[4985.16 --> 4988.16]  Agape love makes us brotherly love
[4988.16 --> 4993.16]  Right? Agape love makes us to be devoted to one another
[4994.16 --> 4995.16]  And then Paul continues in verse 10
[4996.16 --> 4997.16]  He finishes and says in love
[4998.16 --> 4999.16]  Be devoted to one another in love
[5000.16 --> 5001.16]  Now we can pick up that word in love
[5002.16 --> 5004.16]  But that's also another unique word
[5005.16 --> 5006.16]  Right? In the New Testament
[5007.16 --> 5008.16]  That word is
[5009.16 --> 5010.16]  Philos storgoi
[5011.16 --> 5012.16]  Philos meaning love
[5013.16 --> 5015.16]  Storgoi meaning love of family
[5015.16 --> 5017.16]  Right? Another compound
[5018.16 --> 5019.16]  It's a natural affection
[5019.16 --> 5020.16]  A family affection
[5021.16 --> 5022.16]  Like a mother for her child
[5025.16 --> 5026.16]  Now that means there's probably
[5027.16 --> 5030.16]  A sort of ferocity and ferocity to it
[5031.16 --> 5034.16]  Or think of a mother lion protecting her cubs
[5036.16 --> 5039.16]  Our new natural familial affection
[5040.16 --> 5042.16]  Is devoted to brotherly affection
[5042.16 --> 5044.16]  Because of the affections of Jesus
[5045.16 --> 5046.16]  For his bride
[5047.16 --> 5049.16]  Which is the third metaphor that the Bible uses for the church
[5050.16 --> 5052.16]  A body, a family, and a bride
[5053.16 --> 5055.16]  But it doesn't end there
[5058.16 --> 5060.16]  Verse 13 uses one more word for love
[5061.16 --> 5063.16]  It says, share with the Lord's people who are in need
[5064.16 --> 5067.16]  Practice or pursue, as we've said, hospitality
[5067.16 --> 5069.16]  Now look at that sentence
[5070.16 --> 5071.16]  What word do you think it is?
[5072.16 --> 5073.16]  Hospitality
[5074.16 --> 5075.16]  Hospitality
[5078.16 --> 5081.16]  Hospitality is the fourth type of love used
[5082.16 --> 5086.16]  Right? It's used only here and in Hebrews 13 verse 2
[5087.16 --> 5091.16]  And the word translated hospitality literally means love of stranger
[5091.16 --> 5096.16]  Philos, love, xenos, stranger
[5097.16 --> 5101.16]  Now this is the opposite of a word you might be more familiar with
[5102.16 --> 5104.16]  You might have heard the word xenophobia
[5105.16 --> 5107.16]  Right? Xenophobia literally means fear of strangers
[5108.16 --> 5112.16]  We use it to mean a prejudice against people from other countries
[5113.16 --> 5115.16]  And it's usually connected to racism
[5115.16 --> 5122.16]  The Bible says that you, body, do the opposite of that
[5123.16 --> 5124.16]  You love strangers
[5125.16 --> 5127.16]  That's what hospitality in the church is
[5128.16 --> 5131.16]  Right? Hospitality is loving strangers into family
[5132.16 --> 5133.16]  Because of the love of Christ
[5134.16 --> 5137.16]  Right? That's what these stacking of four words gets us to
[5138.16 --> 5142.16]  Loving strangers into family, loved brothers and sisters
[5142.16 --> 5145.16]  Because of Jesus' love
[5146.16 --> 5147.16]  That's how the church grows
[5148.16 --> 5152.16]  Hospitality is literally strangers becoming brothers and sisters
[5153.16 --> 5154.16]  Because of Christ
[5155.16 --> 5156.16]  And we're all supposed to pursue it
[5157.16 --> 5158.16]  Every one of us, it's on all of us
[5159.16 --> 5160.16]  As part of our purpose and mission here
[5161.16 --> 5162.16]  And when I look out at you
[5163.16 --> 5165.16]  I see a whole bunch of strangers
[5166.16 --> 5169.16]  Who have become brothers and sisters to me
[5169.16 --> 5170.16]  When I look out at you
[5172.16 --> 5177.16]  I see people who are in the journey of moving from stranger to beloved family member
[5178.16 --> 5182.16]  And there's something beautiful and compelling about a group of people
[5183.16 --> 5187.16]  Who then in this journey rejoice with those who rejoice
[5188.16 --> 5191.16]  Who in this journey of moving from stranger to brother or sister
[5192.16 --> 5193.16]  Mourn with those who mourn
[5193.16 --> 5195.16]  There's something compelling about a community
[5196.16 --> 5203.16]  Where the chief virtue for leadership is a willingness to serve even the lowest among us
[5206.16 --> 5209.16]  Christianity is all about redefining relationships
[5210.16 --> 5214.16]  Relationships to God and relationships to each other as new families
[5215.16 --> 5218.16]  Strangers made brothers and sisters because of Jesus
[5218.16 --> 5224.16]  And as all of that is true
[5225.16 --> 5229.16]  It changes our relationships to the world around us
[5230.16 --> 5239.16]  Now, for those of you who are looking at your phones to see what time it is
[5240.16 --> 5242.16]  Don't worry, the second half is much shorter than the first half
[5242.16 --> 5247.16]  But here's what I want you to see from this section
[5248.16 --> 5251.16]  In your relationships to the world
[5252.16 --> 5257.16]  In your relationships to people who are not yet converted to Christ
[5258.16 --> 5263.16]  Know that you are not responsible for how they behave
[5264.16 --> 5270.16]  But don't think that's a get out of jail free card
[5270.16 --> 5275.16]  Because you are responsible for how you carry yourself
[5276.16 --> 5280.16]  How you hold yourself in the face of their behavior
[5281.16 --> 5284.16]  Whatever it is, whether it's evil or persecution
[5285.16 --> 5288.16]  Be careful, Paul says, to do what is right in the eyes of everyone
[5289.16 --> 5291.16]  As far as it depends on you
[5292.16 --> 5293.16]  Live at peace with everyone
[5294.16 --> 5296.16]  Here's a hard truth for some of you
[5296.16 --> 5298.16]  You cannot change the people around you
[5299.16 --> 5305.16]  And to have expectations of the people around you who are not Christian
[5306.16 --> 5308.16]  To behave Christianly is impossible for them
[5309.16 --> 5319.16]  But you must have the expectation on yourself to behave Christianly in front of them
[5319.16 --> 5324.16]  And only the Holy Spirit can change hearts and minds
[5325.16 --> 5334.16]  But we also know that the Holy Spirit uses our lives to transform those same hearts and minds for Christ
[5335.16 --> 5340.16]  And so do your utmost to be a willing and useful tool to the Holy Spirit
[5340.16 --> 5344.16]  Much rather he works with you than in spite of you
[5345.16 --> 5346.16]  Amen?
[5347.16 --> 5350.16]  This is part of what it means when Paul says
[5351.16 --> 5355.16]  Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good
[5356.16 --> 5358.16]  And if your enemy is hungry
[5359.16 --> 5360.16]  Give him something to eat
[5360.16 --> 5361.16]  If he's thirsty
[5361.16 --> 5362.16]  Give him something to drink
[5363.16 --> 5366.16]  Or I'll put it a little bit more close to home for myself
[5367.16 --> 5369.16]  If he's the angry neighbor next door
[5370.16 --> 5372.16]  Who complains all the time about the bush on your property line
[5373.16 --> 5374.16]  That seems to infringe on his side
[5375.16 --> 5376.16]  Offer to pray for him
[5377.16 --> 5379.16]  When he tells you that he's been having a rough year
[5380.16 --> 5382.16]  After a cancer diagnosis and treatment
[5383.16 --> 5384.16]  And he says, oh, but I'm not a prayer
[5385.16 --> 5387.16]  I said, that's okay, you don't have to be, I am
[5387.16 --> 5393.16]  And maybe he'll show up the next day with a gift of thanks
[5394.16 --> 5396.16]  And that relationship has changed
[5397.16 --> 5398.16]  All of a sudden
[5399.16 --> 5401.16]  Now it's not about the gift, let me be really clear
[5402.16 --> 5403.16]  But there's an impact on behavior
[5404.16 --> 5407.16]  When I choose to be faithful, even when it's awkward
[5408.16 --> 5410.16]  Even when it's hard, even when it's weird
[5411.16 --> 5415.16]  That's part, I believe, of what Paul is getting at when he quotes Proverbs 25
[5415.16 --> 5419.16]  Right, you're doing good to those who do evil to you
[5419.16 --> 5420.16]  Or who treat you poorly
[5421.16 --> 5423.16]  You're loving them because Christ first loved you
[5424.16 --> 5429.16]  Can be used by God to lead to their repentance and their profession of faith in God
[5430.16 --> 5434.16]  Your relationship to God and to each other and to the world
[5435.16 --> 5438.16]  Is used by God to restore people in relationship to him
[5438.16 --> 5441.16]  And so we've come full circle, haven't we?
[5442.16 --> 5445.16]  Your real and personal relationship to God
[5446.16 --> 5447.16]  Changes your relationships to other Christians
[5448.16 --> 5449.16]  Making them like family
[5450.16 --> 5453.16]  Brothers and sisters in Christ Jesus
[5454.16 --> 5456.16]  Strangers into family
[5457.16 --> 5461.16]  That's a miracle that keeps on happening in the world today
[5461.16 --> 5465.16]  And your relationship to God, your relationship to the body
[5466.16 --> 5469.16]  Changes how you have relationships in the world
[5470.16 --> 5474.16]  It changes your posture into service and humility
[5478.16 --> 5480.16]  And yes, and amen
[5481.16 --> 5484.16]  Of course it is true that only God changes the world
[5484.16 --> 5487.16]  And He does that through you and through me
[5488.16 --> 5489.16]  And so as we go today
[5490.16 --> 5494.16]  Will you be part of painting this picture of God's people?
[5495.16 --> 5499.16]  Will you be part of painting this picture of God's people?
[5500.16 --> 5511.16]  Will you be part of God using your life and your relationship to him and to others to draw people to himself?
[5511.16 --> 5513.16]  And that through you and to himself
[5514.16 --> 5516.16]  I have seen it among you
[5517.16 --> 5521.16]  And again, I see some of you sitting here
[5522.16 --> 5523.16]  Precisely because this is your story
[5524.16 --> 5526.16]  And for that I praise God
[5527.16 --> 5529.16]  For that I give Him thanks
[5530.16 --> 5532.16]  And for that I say amen
[5533.16 --> 5534.16]  Let's pray together
[5537.16 --> 5538.16]  Holy God
[5538.16 --> 5544.66]  Holy God, you are so amazing among us.
[5545.68 --> 5549.32]  Even as you restore us to relationships with you,
[5549.48 --> 5553.34]  send us out now step by step to walk with you.
[5554.00 --> 5557.24]  Send us out now step by step to walk with each other.
[5558.34 --> 5563.26]  Send us out now step by step that we might declare your praises.
[5563.26 --> 5567.90]  And that in so declaring your praises, Lord God,
[5568.08 --> 5577.34]  that others may come to see and know that you are good and that you are God.
[5578.66 --> 5585.72]  Fill us to overflowing, that as we spill out, it might be your love that guides our steps.
[5586.36 --> 5588.86]  In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[5593.26 --> 5607.28]  Let's stand together.
[5623.26 --> 5625.26]  Amen.
[5625.26 --> 5626.26]  Amen.
[5653.26 --> 5660.10]  And I will leave him for me, and I will learn to walk in your ways.
[5661.88 --> 5671.56]  Step by step you'll lead me, and I will follow you all on my days.
[5672.84 --> 5681.60]  Oh God, you are my God, and I will praise you.
[5681.60 --> 5691.56]  Oh God, you are my God, and I will never praise you.
[5692.54 --> 5702.64]  I will seek you in the morning, and I will learn to walk in your ways.
[5702.64 --> 5711.54]  Then step by step you'll be here, and I will follow you all the Friday.
[5724.38 --> 5732.30]  As we go into this week, we go with the blessing of God, and you go right now with two invitations.
[5732.64 --> 5740.66]  First, following our worship, we have a time of gathering and fellowship at the back, and so please stick around for that.
[5740.66 --> 5745.86]  Assuming everything worked well, there's coffee and refreshments available to you.
[5746.04 --> 5752.62]  But more importantly, there's brothers and sisters who want to be present with you together.
[5753.52 --> 5757.78]  Second invitation, there is people available for prayer.
[5758.38 --> 5761.02]  One of them has a yellow name tag on.
[5761.02 --> 5765.84]  That's Dick, who was already up, although he did say he is also on coffee service.
[5765.94 --> 5770.30]  And so if you need prayer, go to the kitchen, and he'll pray with you there while making coffee.
[5771.28 --> 5772.08]  Right, Dick?
[5772.68 --> 5773.58]  There it is.
[5775.58 --> 5778.52]  Go with the blessing of God.
[5778.52 --> 5782.56]  God, go before you to lead you.
[5783.22 --> 5785.04]  God, go behind you to protect you.
[5785.38 --> 5787.28]  God, go beneath you to support you.
[5787.62 --> 5791.90]  And God, go beside you to befriend you and make you a brother.
[5792.80 --> 5794.02]  Do not be afraid.
[5794.46 --> 5796.42]  Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[5796.56 --> 5802.32]  Do not be afraid, but go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
[5802.32 --> 5803.86]  Amen.
[5803.86 --> 5805.86]  Amen.
[5833.86 --> 5840.86]  I want your trust in you, and in all I'm doing in water and water.
[5842.86 --> 5850.86]  Oh, I love you, breathe in my deep air.
[5850.86 --> 5860.86]  You are faithful, through the ages you never change.
[5863.86 --> 5871.86]  But though I live in the dark of night, set up here to fight you, our love and truth.
[5871.86 --> 5879.86]  I want your trust in you, and in all I do bring you water and peace.
[5880.86 --> 5889.86]  Oh, I love you, breathe in my deep air.
[5889.86 --> 5897.86]  You are faithful, through the ages you never change.
[5897.86 --> 5901.86]  Oh, I love you, breathe in my deep air.
[5901.86 --> 5903.86]  Oh, I love you, breathe in my deep air.
[5903.86 --> 5909.86]  Oh, I love you, breathe in my deep air.
[5909.86 --> 5913.86]  Oh, I love you, breathe in my deep air.
[5913.86 --> 5915.86]  You are faithful, through the ages you never change.
[5915.86 --> 5917.86]  Oh, I love you, breathe in my deep air.
[5917.86 --> 5921.86]  You are faithful, through the ages you never change.
[5921.86 --> 5925.86]  Oh, I love you, breathe in my deep air.
[5925.86 --> 5927.86]  You are faithful, through the ages you never change.
[5927.86 --> 5937.86]  You are faithful, through the ages you never change.
[5937.86 --> 5942.86]  Oh, I love you, breathe in my deep air.
[5942.86 --> 5951.86]  You are faithful, through the ages you never change.
[5951.86 --> 5973.86]  You are faithful, through the ages you never change.
[5973.86 --> 5975.86]  Amen.
[6003.86 --> 6005.86]  Amen.
[6033.86 --> 6035.86]  Amen.
[6063.86 --> 6065.86]  Amen.
[6093.86 --> 6095.86]  Amen.
[6123.86 --> 6125.86]  Amen.
[6153.86 --> 6155.86]  Amen.
[6183.86 --> 6185.86]  Amen.
[6213.86 --> 6215.86]  Amen.
[6243.86 --> 6245.86]  Amen.
[6273.86 --> 6275.86]  Amen.
[6303.86 --> 6305.86]  Amen.
[6333.86 --> 6335.86]  Amen.
[6363.86 --> 6365.86]  Amen.
[6393.86 --> 6395.86]  Amen.
[6423.86 --> 6425.86]  Amen.
[6453.86 --> 6455.86]  Amen.
[6483.86 --> 6485.86]  Amen.
[6513.86 --> 6515.86]  Amen.
[6543.86 --> 6545.86]  Amen.
