• Homo sapiens is derived from Latin, meaning "creature or human wise".

• Thinking and loving to come together in worship
• Worship shapes practices which shape lives
• What we worship determines who we are

• Good theology leads naturally into praise (doxology)
• Superficial ideas about God lead to superficial worship
• Deep understanding and knowledge of God can evoke deeper affections and worship
• Paul's teaching in Romans demonstrates how good theology turns into doxology (speaking glory or a word of praise)
• The doxology is a song sung after worship that expresses praise to God.
• The speaker will use Romans 11:34-36 as the basis for discussing the structure of right worship.
• Right worship involves recognizing that all blessings flow from God and adoring Him.
• Worship should be centred on understanding who we are in light of our understanding of who God is.
• The speaker references Grenades, a church father from the 2nd century, to emphasize this point.

• The role of mystery in right worship, as revealed in Paul's doxology
• The limitations of human understanding and the necessity of humility in worshipping the true God
• The distinction between what is necessary to be known about God versus knowing the whole of who God is
• The speaker questions the assumption that God's actions must make sense to humans
• This perspective is not supported by biblical examples of individuals who struggled with understanding God's ways
• Mystery and the unknown are essential aspects of human experience with God
• Examples from the Bible, such as Job, Habakkuk, Ezekiel, Mary, and baptism, illustrate this concept
• Recognizing the mystery in our experience of God is crucial for developing a balanced theology
• Necessity of engaging with God's mysteries for genuine worship

• Paul's questions in Romans 11:34-35 as examples of questioning God
• The connection between Descartes' "bonito ergo sum" and doubting one's existence
• The value of bringing questions and doubts into the presence of God in worship
• The submission of questions to scripture and the role of the preached word in worship
• Worship is not just about what we receive from God, but also about what we give to Him.
• Humble submission to God's will and sovereignty is essential in worship.
• The traditional question "I didn't get anything out of worship" should be reframed to ask what we can bring to God during worship.
• Worship gives us a right perspective on God and ourselves, leading to fullness of life and glorifying God.
• The ultimate goal of human existence is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever.

• The meaning of "Amen" and its use in worship
