[0.00 --> 7.00]  Who wants a box?
[7.00 --> 9.00]  Who wants a box?
[9.00 --> 11.00]  My name is Hans.
[11.00 --> 13.00]  I am Franz.
[13.00 --> 15.00]  And we are here to box you up.
[15.00 --> 17.00]  We love you, Randy.
[17.00 --> 19.00]  Have a great day.
[19.00 --> 34.00]  So throughout the weekend, we've had Trinity Western and Redeemer here hanging out with
[34.00 --> 37.00]  the students and they're sponsors of Reactivate and we love having them here.
[37.00 --> 42.00]  And I want to invite Lauren and Diego up for the giveaways.
[42.00 --> 46.00]  They have some nice swag packs to give away and they've been collecting students' information.
[46.00 --> 53.00]  We'll invite them up and then we'll have Redeemer show a video and give a little spiel.
[53.00 --> 57.00]  How many names do you guys have?
[57.00 --> 58.00]  Two?
[58.00 --> 59.00]  One.
[59.00 --> 61.00]  Who do we want to do first?
[61.00 --> 64.00]  Okay, we'll do Trinity Western first.
[64.00 --> 67.00]  Hey guys.
[67.00 --> 68.00]  Hello.
[68.00 --> 70.00]  What's up?
[70.00 --> 74.00]  Who wants a free sweater, a bucket hat, and socks?
[74.00 --> 75.00]  Awesome.
[75.00 --> 77.00]  Only one of you will get it, but that's cool.
[77.00 --> 79.00]  Alright, I'm going to pick a name.
[79.00 --> 80.00]  Could you hold the jar for me?
[80.00 --> 82.00]  Could I have a drum roll please?
[82.00 --> 83.00]  Thank you.
[83.00 --> 87.00]  And the winner is...
[87.00 --> 92.00]  Chase Vanderkoi.
[92.00 --> 93.00]  Chase Vanderkoi?
[93.00 --> 94.00]  Yeah, Chase.
[94.00 --> 96.00]  Come on up here.
[96.00 --> 98.00]  Get your stuff.
[98.00 --> 103.00]  Yeah, good job Chase.
[103.00 --> 104.00]  Chase.
[104.00 --> 105.00]  Chase guys.
[105.00 --> 106.00]  He's the winner.
[106.00 --> 107.00]  Alright, okay.
[107.00 --> 109.00]  I'm actually going to pick two names.
[109.00 --> 110.00]  The bags are the same except one of them has Sour Patch Kids and one of them has Swedish
[110.00 --> 111.00]  Berries.
[111.00 --> 112.00]  So whoever comes first gets to choose.
[112.00 --> 113.00]  Alright, drum roll please.
[113.00 --> 114.00]  Oh no.
[114.00 --> 115.00]  Actually, I'm going to pick two names.
[115.00 --> 116.00]  I'm going to pick two names.
[116.00 --> 117.00]  I'm going to pick two names.
[117.00 --> 121.00]  The bags are the same except one of them has Sour Patch Kids and one of them has Swedish Berries.
[121.00 --> 122.00]  So whoever comes first gets to choose.
[122.00 --> 123.00]  Alright, drum roll please.
[123.00 --> 124.00]  Oh no.
[124.00 --> 136.00]  Actually, that was Chase Vanderkoi again so I'm not going to let you do another one.
[136.00 --> 137.00]  Sorry.
[137.00 --> 138.00]  Okay.
[138.00 --> 139.00]  Let's go.
[139.00 --> 140.00]  Atticus Fluitt.
[140.00 --> 141.00]  Alright.
[141.00 --> 145.00]  Sour Patch Kids or Swedish Berries.
[145.00 --> 147.00]  Nice, good choice.
[147.00 --> 148.00]  Alright.
[148.00 --> 149.00]  Second one.
[149.00 --> 150.00]  Last one at the time.
[150.00 --> 151.00]  Drum roll.
[151.00 --> 158.00]  Swedish Berries. Nice, good choice. All right, second one, last one at the time. Drum roll.
[158.00 --> 168.00]  All right, let's hear it. London... Landon Stoddard.
[168.00 --> 179.00]  Landon Stoddard? Yeah, all right. Congratulations.
[181.00 --> 193.00]  Some call university the best time of your life. Maybe, but it's not easy.
[193.00 --> 206.00]  There's lots to figure out. Career, faith, friends, future. There's opportunity, possibility, and a broken world that needs hope.
[206.00 --> 221.00]  Redeemer's the place to get ready for that world. It's time to get off the sidelines and into the game to stretch your mind, test your limits, ask hard questions, and turn answers into action.
[221.00 --> 230.00]  You're called into something big. Jesus Christ is king, and he's on the move redeeming his world.
[230.00 --> 248.00]  It's time to stand up and take a big step into his big story. None of that is easy, and it shouldn't be. It's the best time, because it's a challenge that changes you forever.
[248.00 --> 263.00]  Redeemer is where your faith and future come together. So you're ready. Ready for what? Anything.
[263.00 --> 268.00]  Okay.
[268.00 --> 269.00]  Okay.
[269.00 --> 279.00]  Okay, so hi guys. Trinity Western got to do like a little presentation last night, so I get to go this morning.
[279.00 --> 284.00]  My name's Lauren. I'm an admissions counselor for Redeemer. It's really fun to be here with you guys.
[284.00 --> 295.00]  Yeah. So I'll just tell you a little bit about Redeemer. We're a Christian university. We're based out of the reform tradition, and we're located in Hamilton, Ontario, which is like about an hour away from Toronto.
[295.00 --> 304.00]  We have about 1,100 students, so just over 1,000, and there's roughly 40 different programs that you can study if you want. So just name a few.
[304.00 --> 313.00]  You might be interested in biochemistry or history or psychology, kinesiology, English writing, film production, and the list goes on.
[313.00 --> 319.00]  I have a nice big list over at the booth if you're interested in learning more. There's also tons of hands-on learning opportunities.
[319.00 --> 328.00]  So if you're taking classes, that might look like taking lots of labs if you're a science student and doing experiments or creating student films if you're a film student.
[328.00 --> 337.00]  You can also go on co-ops and internships and like learn how to operate in the business world. Study abroad opportunities in a ton of different countries.
[337.00 --> 348.00]  So there are a lot of ways that you can put what you're learning into practice. And another really cool thing about the way that Redeemer does academics is that faith is really infused into everything that we teach.
[348.00 --> 356.00]  So you don't have to just take a religion or theology course to talk about God and your relationship to him. You talk about him in every single course.
[356.00 --> 367.00]  Because Redeemer's mission is essentially to equip people and students to know how to serve God, glorify him, and reflect his love in every single career no matter what you're doing.
[367.00 --> 377.00]  So we teach you how to be a Christian in biology or a Christian in psychology or a Christian in English writing and to know how to seek God in those places.
[377.00 --> 384.00]  And that also comes out in the community at Redeemer, which is one of my personal favorite things about it. It's such an amazing community.
[384.00 --> 390.00]  Everyone is just so welcoming and you really strive to make people feel at home.
[390.00 --> 395.00]  And that comes out in the way that we do dorms where you live actually in a townhouse with a bunch of roommates.
[395.00 --> 402.00]  And it feels kind of like a little family, which is really fun. And I love, love the community there. It's just like, it really feels like home.
[402.00 --> 411.00]  And it really like, it's a full of people who strive to inspire you and spur you on in your faith and show you how to grow and how to seek God better.
[411.00 --> 423.00]  So yeah, if you are interested in experiencing that, we have a lot of visit days. I know that it seems maybe a little bit far, but Redeemer actually will pay for at least part of your flight if you choose to come.
[423.00 --> 429.00]  And we have specific long distance visit weekends for people who might be interested in coming, like maybe some of you.
[429.00 --> 437.00]  So if you're interested in that, please come and talk to me. I've got a booth over there and I would love to just chat with you about anything, answer any questions you might have.
[437.00 --> 441.00]  So yeah, thanks so much for having me. This has been really fun.
[446.00 --> 450.00]  Oh, there it is. Well, good morning, everyone.
[450.00 --> 458.00]  The youth are tired, the church is confused. It's all good.
[458.00 --> 464.00]  It is so good to be gathered here in this place together for this church service.
[464.00 --> 473.00]  And as you look around, you realize we've got about 177 ish youth and leaders from all over the province.
[473.00 --> 482.00]  We've got another chunk of people who are part of this body, this church here, and we are coming together here to worship our Lord together.
[482.00 --> 485.00]  It's a really cool thing. I was thinking about this the other day.
[485.00 --> 490.00]  Youth, it's a real privilege for us to be able to come here to this conference.
[490.00 --> 500.00]  And specifically today, it's a privilege for us to be able to come together and worship with not just our peers, our fellow youth and our youth leaders, but also a congregation.
[500.00 --> 504.00]  People of different ages, across the board, and we gather together.
[504.00 --> 510.00]  And in congregation at Emmanuel, it's also a privilege for us that we get to sit here today as the body of Christ.
[510.00 --> 514.00]  And we are joined by 170 students from all over BC.
[514.00 --> 517.00]  And so this is a beautiful picture of what the body of Christ is.
[517.00 --> 520.00]  And we get to worship our Lord and Savior together today.
[520.00 --> 525.00]  If you are sitting in a row, we have some people sort of filing in a little bit.
[525.00 --> 528.00]  It'd be very good if some of the end seats were available.
[528.00 --> 536.00]  So if you look and there's like a spot that you could squish into the middle a little bit, make it obvious for our ushers who could help seat some of those who are coming up.
[536.00 --> 538.00]  That would be wonderful.
[538.00 --> 541.00]  I didn't do this, but my name is Kevin Lobert.
[541.00 --> 545.00]  I am the youth pastor here at Langley Emanuel CRC.
[545.00 --> 548.00]  And I wanted to actually introduce you to a few other people.
[548.00 --> 550.00]  I didn't tell them I was doing this, so sorry everybody.
[550.00 --> 557.00]  But can the reactivate leadership team, the reactivate leadership team, nailed it.
[557.00 --> 558.00]  Can you guys come forward?
[558.00 --> 560.00]  Ben, Kaitlin, Curtis.
[560.00 --> 561.00]  I saw Natasha.
[561.00 --> 562.00]  She's holding a little one.
[562.00 --> 563.00]  Is she around?
[563.00 --> 565.00]  Is she here too?
[565.00 --> 566.00]  Yeah, just a minute.
[566.00 --> 567.00]  I'll come down with you.
[567.00 --> 570.00]  And then if Natasha's here, Eric, you were here too.
[570.00 --> 571.00]  Where's Eric?
[571.00 --> 572.00]  You can come up as well.
[572.00 --> 573.00]  Yeah, Eric, come up here.
[573.00 --> 575.00]  So this is the reactivate leadership team.
[575.00 --> 577.00]  If you see Natasha, she's holding a little baby.
[577.00 --> 580.00]  She's kicking around somewhere.
[580.00 --> 584.00]  But these are the people that for an entire year, in about two weeks, we're going to get
[584.00 --> 585.00]  together.
[585.00 --> 588.00]  We're going to talk about this one and we're going to start planning the next one.
[588.00 --> 590.00]  And so this is the team that's doing that.
[590.00 --> 591.00]  It might grow.
[591.00 --> 595.00]  But we've got Ben here who's like administrative extraordinaire.
[595.00 --> 596.00]  He's joined last year.
[596.00 --> 598.00]  He's from Living Hope.
[598.00 --> 600.00]  Yeah, we cheer for Ben.
[600.00 --> 602.00]  We've got Curtis here.
[602.00 --> 605.00]  He's like point man website.
[605.00 --> 608.00]  He ran this thing by himself basically for a couple of years.
[608.00 --> 610.00]  And so he's a bit of a guru.
[610.00 --> 612.00]  He's a student out in Enderby.
[612.00 --> 613.00]  We could cheer for Curtis.
[615.00 --> 617.00]  We've got Caitlin here.
[617.00 --> 618.00]  I'm moving over.
[618.00 --> 619.00]  We've got Caitlin here.
[619.00 --> 620.00]  She's from East Hills.
[620.00 --> 621.00]  She's a youth pastor.
[621.00 --> 622.00]  She runs that church.
[622.00 --> 623.00]  That's not true.
[623.00 --> 624.00]  She's doing a lot in that church.
[624.00 --> 626.00]  She's very busy over there.
[626.00 --> 630.00]  She does like all of the socials and she comes up with all of the good ideas when I have
[630.00 --> 631.00]  bad ones.
[631.00 --> 632.00]  And so we love Caitlin.
[632.00 --> 633.00]  We could cheer for her.
[635.00 --> 636.00]  And then we've got Eric here.
[636.00 --> 637.00]  Eric's in charge.
[637.00 --> 642.00]  He did like stuff with the prayer room and he led a bunch of the Livet stuff that got that
[642.00 --> 644.00]  organized and the Learnits as well.
[644.00 --> 645.00]  He helped operate a lot of those.
[645.00 --> 646.00]  And so we love Eric.
[646.00 --> 647.00]  We could cheer for him too.
[647.00 --> 651.00]  And then you got me and I just kind of flap my mouth a bunch.
[651.00 --> 652.00]  What's that?
[652.00 --> 653.00]  Natasha, come here.
[653.00 --> 655.00]  I invited you forward before, but you weren't listening.
[655.00 --> 656.00]  No, you were busy.
[656.00 --> 657.00]  This is Natasha.
[657.00 --> 659.00]  We could cheer for Natasha right now.
[659.00 --> 664.00]  And this is, this is, this is little Ezekiel.
[664.00 --> 667.00]  Ezekiel's how many weeks old?
[667.00 --> 670.00]  Ezekiel's three weeks old.
[670.00 --> 671.00]  I know.
[671.00 --> 673.00]  Natasha left us in a bit of a bind.
[673.00 --> 675.00]  She didn't plan that well.
[675.00 --> 679.00]  So she disappeared and things fell apart.
[679.00 --> 683.00]  But we figured it out because she does a lot of work above kind of all of it.
[683.00 --> 686.00]  And so let's cheer for Ezekiel a little bit.
[686.00 --> 687.00]  Hooray.
[687.00 --> 688.00]  We love Ezekiel.
[688.00 --> 689.00]  Okay.
[689.00 --> 690.00]  I'm going to get loud again.
[690.00 --> 691.00]  So, okay.
[691.00 --> 692.00]  So this is your leadership team.
[692.00 --> 693.00]  There's also a few more.
[693.00 --> 694.00]  You guys can sit.
[694.00 --> 701.00]  We also have, and I don't know if they're going to be kicking around, but there's a lot of volunteers in this church.
[701.00 --> 703.00]  There's way too many to thank.
[703.00 --> 707.00]  So there's about 170 volunteer slots that need filled throughout this weekend.
[707.00 --> 711.00]  And this church filled 166 of them or something like that.
[711.00 --> 722.00]  And so Langley Emanuel, a huge thank you to you for hosting this conference and stepping up in that way.
[722.00 --> 726.00]  There are, and I had to draw a line somewhere.
[726.00 --> 729.00]  There's a bunch of people I could name, but there's a few people I want to thank.
[729.00 --> 730.00]  Oh, good.
[730.00 --> 731.00]  And one's walking right now.
[731.00 --> 734.00]  There is Faye Shonit.
[734.00 --> 735.00]  She's right here.
[735.00 --> 736.00]  She's going to wave.
[736.00 --> 737.00]  Faye's going to wave her hand.
[737.00 --> 738.00]  Yeah.
[738.00 --> 739.00]  Well, Faye's waving.
[739.00 --> 740.00]  That's Faye.
[740.00 --> 742.00]  She has been in charge of all of the food.
[742.00 --> 745.00]  So everything you ate, Faye had her fingers in.
[745.00 --> 747.00]  And so just remember that.
[747.00 --> 748.00]  We love Faye.
[748.00 --> 749.00]  Thank you so much, Faye, for helping us.
[749.00 --> 751.00]  I think that deserves a really big cheer.
[751.00 --> 752.00]  Thanks, Faye.
[752.00 --> 757.00]  And then we also have Rachel DeWinter.
[757.00 --> 760.00]  Rachel DeWinter has been in charge of all of our volunteers.
[760.00 --> 764.00]  So someone needed to coordinate all of that and schedule all of that and email all of that.
[764.00 --> 765.00]  And I suck at that.
[765.00 --> 766.00]  And Rachel's really good at that.
[766.00 --> 767.00]  And so Rachel did that.
[767.00 --> 771.00]  And this whole operation behind the scenes kind of runs through her.
[771.00 --> 773.00]  So thank you so much, Rachel.
[773.00 --> 779.00]  Finally, I'm going to do a pair of people.
[779.00 --> 782.00]  We have Matt and we've got Linda who are in the back.
[782.00 --> 783.00]  They have come all weekend.
[783.00 --> 785.00]  They set up Reactivate for the week ahead.
[785.00 --> 789.00]  All of the general session stuff, the lights, the sound, the media.
[789.00 --> 790.00]  That is all them.
[790.00 --> 792.00]  So Matt and Linda, thank you so much.
[792.00 --> 795.00]  Matt especially comes all the way from the island to do this.
[795.00 --> 806.00]  And now we are going to start church.
[806.00 --> 807.00]  I know that's weird.
[807.00 --> 808.00]  We have been doing church.
[808.00 --> 811.00]  But now we're going to kind of enter into the presence of God.
[811.00 --> 814.00]  I'm going to invite Pastor Chris forward.
[814.00 --> 818.00]  And he is going to come forward and he's going to lead us in God's greeting this morning.
[818.00 --> 822.00]  And then Jean Vieve is going to come forward and lead us into a call to worship.
[822.00 --> 825.00]  And we'll praise our God together.
[825.00 --> 827.00]  Good morning.
[827.00 --> 829.00]  How are you guys doing?
[829.00 --> 830.00]  Decent.
[830.00 --> 833.00]  I appreciate the honesty from this side.
[833.00 --> 834.00]  That's great.
[834.00 --> 838.00]  I want to welcome you all to Reactivate.
[838.00 --> 841.00]  And I hope and pray you had an awesome weekend.
[841.00 --> 844.00]  I had a chance to sit in on your session last night.
[844.00 --> 848.00]  And I know that Pastor Dave has been leading you into the presence of Christ.
[848.00 --> 851.00]  And I am so grateful for that.
[851.00 --> 854.00]  And it's my prayer that that continues this morning.
[854.00 --> 857.00]  This morning we enter into the presence of our God.
[857.00 --> 859.00]  And he welcomes us and he greets us.
[859.00 --> 863.00]  And so what I'm going to ask you to do as you're able and where you are is to stand.
[863.00 --> 866.00]  We're going to receive the greeting of our God.
[866.00 --> 869.00]  And what I like to say is take a posture of receipt.
[869.00 --> 873.00]  And so maybe that's holding your hands out.
[873.00 --> 876.00]  Maybe that's closing your eyes and reflecting on these words.
[876.00 --> 883.00]  Maybe that's just imagining your heart opening up to hear the voice of Jesus in this moment.
[883.00 --> 888.00]  And after I give you God's greeting, I'm going to invite you to turn to those around you and to greet them.
[888.00 --> 889.00]  And to greet them.
[889.00 --> 892.00]  Now some of you reactivate kids haven't washed your hands all weekend.
[892.00 --> 895.00]  So maybe you don't want to actually shake hands.
[895.00 --> 897.00]  But you can fist bump.
[897.00 --> 899.00]  Everyone else, you can shake hands.
[899.00 --> 900.00]  You can fist bump.
[900.00 --> 904.00]  You can nod your head if you don't want to be interacting with other people in that way.
[904.00 --> 906.00]  But welcome them in the name of the Lord.
[906.00 --> 909.00]  One of the ways you can do that is by saying the Lord be with you.
[909.00 --> 913.00]  Another way you can do that is by saying the peace of Christ be with you.
[913.00 --> 918.00]  And so receive God's greeting and then turn to greet those around you.
[918.00 --> 927.00]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Savior,
[927.00 --> 931.00]  through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[931.00 --> 932.00]  Amen.

[978.08 --> 979.64]  I'm going to call us into worship.
[980.04 --> 984.24]  And this is one of those things where I say something and then you say something.
[984.64 --> 985.66]  And hopefully it's on.
[985.86 --> 986.54]  There we go.
[986.76 --> 987.10]  All right.
[988.16 --> 990.30]  Clap your hands, all you people.
[991.10 --> 991.34]  Woo!
[991.50 --> 993.02]  Yeah, we've been doing a lot of that today.
[994.36 --> 997.50]  Shout to God with loud songs of joy.
[997.50 --> 998.66]  Yeah!
[1001.00 --> 1004.02]  Okay, this is the part where you read up there.
[1004.90 --> 1011.44]  For the Lord most high is awesome, a great King over all the earth.
[1012.40 --> 1016.60]  God has gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet.
[1017.90 --> 1021.16]  Sing praises to God, sing praises.
[1021.52 --> 1024.60]  Sing praises to our King, sing praises.
[1024.60 --> 1024.84]  Sing praises.
[1031.00 --> 1031.44]  Good morning.
[1032.02 --> 1032.78]  Good morning.
[1032.96 --> 1033.44]  Good morning.
[1035.58 --> 1037.14]  Wow, this room's a lot fuller.
[1038.72 --> 1040.08]  There's a lot of...
[1040.08 --> 1042.22]  Did the youth just grow up overnight or something?
[1043.38 --> 1044.80]  Hey, it's good to see everyone.
[1047.50 --> 1049.04]  This has been a wonderful time.
[1049.12 --> 1052.78]  We've had an amazing time worshiping with you guys.
[1052.78 --> 1053.66]  We've had a good...
[1053.66 --> 1059.20]  And it's lovely to worship with the people that actually attend this church.
[1060.70 --> 1067.04]  And we were loud.
[1067.04 --> 1074.24]  And I think the kids were louder than we were, which is always really exciting.
[1074.44 --> 1083.18]  However, I recognize that sometimes music is a chart, is a little bit of a difference.
[1083.18 --> 1088.74]  And there's some cultural differences in different appreciations and such.
[1088.74 --> 1095.02]  And as a thing for everyone that's guessing here today, I actually bought earplugs at the back.
[1095.28 --> 1101.26]  If it is a little too loud for you, and there is no shame in getting them, I just wanted to let you know that it's available.
[1101.92 --> 1105.82]  Because I recognize it's not a pleasant thing for this.
[1105.88 --> 1107.94]  But the point is, it's not how it sounds.
[1107.98 --> 1109.86]  It's not the point of how loud it is.
[1110.20 --> 1111.58]  The point is, it's what we're doing.
[1112.28 --> 1115.10]  And we're here to worship our Father.
[1115.10 --> 1125.18]  And so, in the midst of those things, I just wanted to leave an opportunity if it's too distracting or too harsh.
[1126.20 --> 1127.64]  I understand that.
[1128.18 --> 1131.60]  And that's our little way of just preparing for you.
[1132.54 --> 1136.46]  For what we've been experiencing as a youth group together this last weekend.
[1136.64 --> 1137.92]  Anyway, I'm going to stop talking.
[1139.60 --> 1141.88]  So, Father, meet with us today.
[1141.88 --> 1146.18]  We recognize that you hold space.
[1148.28 --> 1150.66]  We recognize that you hold time.
[1154.50 --> 1168.58]  And we have the opportunity to engage with you and sing songs that we need to sing to express how much we delight in who you are.
[1168.58 --> 1173.14]  So, be with us this morning.
[1174.10 --> 1178.68]  Make your presence known in a beautiful way, in a fresh way.
[1178.68 --> 1202.34]  Turn your ear to heaven and hear the noise inside.
[1202.34 --> 1212.34]  The sound of angels, the sound of angels songs.
[1212.34 --> 1216.16]  And all this for a king.
[1217.44 --> 1220.42]  We could join and sing.
[1222.02 --> 1225.48]  All through Christ the King.
[1225.48 --> 1229.36]  How constant, how divine.
[1229.36 --> 1229.38]  How constant, how divine.
[1230.38 --> 1234.40]  This song of ours will rise.
[1234.40 --> 1237.94]  How constant, how divine.
[1238.94 --> 1243.38]  This song of ours will rise.
[1243.88 --> 1245.72]  Will rise.
[1245.72 --> 1253.18]  Oh, praise Him.
[1253.18 --> 1257.24]  Oh, praise Him.
[1257.24 --> 1260.74]  He is holy.
[1260.74 --> 1265.28]  He is holy.
[1265.28 --> 1266.28]  We could join and sing.
[1266.28 --> 1267.66]  Turn your gaze to heaven.
[1267.66 --> 1271.72]  Turn your gaze to heaven.
[1271.72 --> 1276.74]  And raise a joyous noise.
[1276.74 --> 1282.78]  The sound of angels songs.
[1282.78 --> 1287.12]  The sound of rescued ones.
[1287.12 --> 1288.12]  And all this for a king.
[1288.12 --> 1290.12]  And all this for a king.
[1290.12 --> 1294.12]  We could join and sing.
[1294.12 --> 1299.12]  All through Christ the King.
[1299.12 --> 1303.12]  Oh, praise Him.
[1303.12 --> 1307.12]  Oh, praise Him.
[1307.12 --> 1310.12]  He is holy.
[1310.12 --> 1312.12]  He is holy.
[1312.12 --> 1317.12]  He is holy.
[1317.12 --> 1318.12]  Oh, praise Him.
[1318.12 --> 1320.12]  Oh, praise Him.
[1320.12 --> 1325.12]  Oh, praise Him.
[1325.12 --> 1328.12]  He is holy.
[1328.12 --> 1333.12]  He is holy.
[1333.12 --> 1363.10]  Oh la la la la la la
[1363.12 --> 1393.10]  Oh la la la la la la
[1393.14 --> 1400.32]  Oh praise Him

[1407.92 --> 1412.38]  He is holy
[1412.38 --> 1417.52]  Oh praise Him
[1417.52 --> 1429.44]  Oh, praise Him. He is holy. He is holy.
[1429.44 --> 1459.42]  Oh, la, la, la, la, la, la.
[1459.44 --> 1468.44]  Oh, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
[1475.08 --> 1488.54]  In my wrestling and in my doubts, in my fears, you won't walk out.
[1488.54 --> 1495.04]  Your great love will lead me through.
[1496.54 --> 1501.98]  You are the peace in my troubled sea.
[1501.98 --> 1508.48]  Oh, you are the peace in my trouble.
[1508.48 --> 1513.98]  Bold sea.
[1513.98 --> 1516.48]  My voice is going.
[1516.48 --> 1520.48]  I'm going to need your help.
[1520.48 --> 1521.98]  Would you mind joining us up here?
[1521.98 --> 1526.98]  Yes, I am!

[1577.58 --> 1581.68]  You are the peace in my troubled sea
[1581.68 --> 1586.48]  Oh, you are the peace in my troubled sea

[1757.98 --> 1767.98]  Safe to shore.

[1876.98 --> 1883.98]  We will cry our hallelujah
[1883.98 --> 1893.98]  All the world is dark and seen
[1893.98 --> 1899.98]  And all that feel unworthy
[1899.98 --> 1906.98]  And all the world with nothing left
[1906.98 --> 1912.98]  We'll know that you are holy
[1912.98 --> 1918.98]  We'll know that you are holy
[1918.98 --> 1926.98]  And all will sing our hallelujah

[1980.98 --> 1984.98]  That he is God

[1998.98 --> 1999.98]  Go on and scream it from the mountains
[1999.98 --> 2003.98]  Go on and tell it to the masses
[2003.98 --> 2008.98]  Go on and tell it to the masses
[2008.98 --> 2011.98]  He is God
[2011.98 --> 2013.98]  He is God
[2013.98 --> 2014.98]  And he is God
[2014.98 --> 2015.98]  He is God
[2015.98 --> 2019.98]  Shout it
[2019.98 --> 2022.98]  Go on and scream it from the mountains
[2022.98 --> 2026.98]  From the mountains
[2026.98 --> 2033.98]  Go on and tell it to the masses
[2033.98 --> 2043.98]  That he is going
[2043.98 --> 2047.98]  Shout it

[2105.98 --> 2113.98]  And we will cry out hallelujah
[2113.98 --> 2128.98]  We will cry out hallelujah

[2150.98 --> 2164.98]  Go on and scream it from the mountains
[2164.98 --> 2168.98]  Go on and tell it to the masses
[2168.98 --> 2175.98]  Go on and tell it to the masses
[2175.98 --> 2181.98]  He is gone
[2181.98 --> 2198.98]  Let's pray
[2198.98 --> 2201.98]  Almighty God
[2201.98 --> 2205.98]  Too often we have sought to be in charge of our own lives
[2205.98 --> 2208.98]  To walk our own paths
[2208.98 --> 2213.98]  To extend our rule over all your creation
[2213.98 --> 2215.98]  In selfish ambition
[2215.98 --> 2220.98]  Whether out of our own desire for independence
[2220.98 --> 2227.98]  Or fear of what you might ask us to do
[2227.98 --> 2233.98]  We have not allowed you to be the ruler of our world
[2233.98 --> 2237.98]  Forgive us for the sin of thinking we know better than you
[2237.98 --> 2241.98]  And acting on that false belief
[2241.98 --> 2246.98]  We confess our need to submit our will to yours
[2246.98 --> 2251.98]  So that we might truly be able to pray that prayer
[2251.98 --> 2256.98]  Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven
[2256.98 --> 2263.98]  Now hear this assurance people of God
[2263.98 --> 2270.98]  Our world fallen into sin has lost its first goodness
[2270.98 --> 2276.98]  But God has not abandoned the work of his hands
[2276.98 --> 2279.98]  Our maker preserves this world
[2279.98 --> 2282.98]  Sending seasons, sun and rain
[2282.98 --> 2287.98]  Upholding all creatures, renewing the earth
[2287.98 --> 2293.98]  Promising a savior, guiding all things to their purpose
[2293.98 --> 2299.98]  God holds this world in fierce love
[2299.98 --> 2305.98]  Keeping his promise, he sends Jesus into the world
[2305.98 --> 2308.98]  Pours out the Holy Spirit
[2308.98 --> 2311.98]  And announces the good news
[2311.98 --> 2315.98]  That sinners who repent and believe in Jesus
[2315.98 --> 2320.98]  Live anew as members of the family of God
[2320.98 --> 2324.98]  The first fruits of a new creation
[2324.98 --> 2325.98]  To creation
[2325.98 --> 2346.98]  Let's sing that one more time
[2346.98 --> 2348.98]  Let's sing that one more time
[2348.98 --> 2356.98]  And all we'll sing out hallelujah
[2356.98 --> 2362.98]  And we will cry out hallelujah
[2362.98 --> 2379.98]  And we will cry out hallelujah
[2379.98 --> 2381.98]  People's grace
[2381.98 --> 2382.98]  Thank you because you Vaughan
[2382.98 --> 2385.98]  God took us who Watts
[2385.98 --> 2415.96]  Thank you.
[2415.98 --> 2427.10]  Hope is built on God's name, blessed in Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[2429.56 --> 2442.20]  I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but only trust in Jesus' name.
[2445.98 --> 2459.36]  My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[2459.36 --> 2474.60]  I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but only trust in Jesus' name.
[2474.60 --> 2487.60]  Christ above, cornerstone, weak made strong.
[2487.60 --> 2502.60]  He is Lord, Lord of all.
[2502.60 --> 2529.10]  When darkness seems to hide His face,
[2529.10 --> 2536.10]  I rest on His with a changing grace.
[2538.10 --> 2543.10]  And every high and storm began,
[2543.10 --> 2550.10]  my anger holds within the veil.
[2550.10 --> 2558.10]  My anger holds within the veil.
[2558.10 --> 2571.10]  Christ alone, cornerstone, weak made strong.
[2571.10 --> 2578.10]  The Savior's love through the storm.
[2578.10 --> 2586.10]  He is Lord, Lord of all.
[2586.10 --> 2593.10]  He is Lord, Lord of all.
[2593.10 --> 2601.10]  He is Lord, Lord of all.
[2601.10 --> 2618.14]  **
[2618.14 --> 2630.08]  Through the storm, He is Lord, Lord.
[2630.08 --> 2651.08]  When He shall come with trumpet sound, O may I then in Him be found,
[2651.08 --> 2664.98]  Just in His righteousness alone, Paul is to stand before the throne.
[2664.98 --> 2682.98]  For Christ alone, cornerstone, we make strong in Savior's love.
[2682.98 --> 2695.98]  Through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all.
[2695.98 --> 2713.98]  Christ alone, cornerstone, we make strong in Savior's love.
[2713.98 --> 2724.98]  Through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all.
[2724.98 --> 2731.98]  Through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all.
[2731.98 --> 2734.98]  You are Lord, Lord of all.
[2734.98 --> 2739.98]  Through the storm, He is Lord, Lord of all.
[2739.98 --> 2769.38]  Shall we do one more?
[2769.98 --> 2770.98]  Yeah.
[2770.98 --> 2771.98]  Absolutely.
[2771.98 --> 2784.98]  Alone in my sorrow and dead to my sin.
[2784.98 --> 2797.98]  Lost in my hope, no place to begin.
[2797.98 --> 2804.98]  Your love made a way to let mercy come in.
[2804.98 --> 2812.98]  When death was arrested, my life began.
[2812.98 --> 2819.98]  Ash was redeemed, only beauty remains.
[2819.98 --> 2834.98]  My orphan heart was given to me.
[2834.98 --> 2841.98]  My morning grew quiet, my feet rose to dance.
[2841.98 --> 2849.98]  When death was arrested, my life began.
[2849.98 --> 2860.98]  Oh, your grace so free washes over me.
[2860.98 --> 2864.98]  You have made me new.
[2864.98 --> 2872.98]  Now life begins with you.
[2872.98 --> 2879.98]  Released from my chains, I'm a prisoner no more.
[2879.98 --> 2887.98]  My shame was a ransom, he feared no more.
[2887.98 --> 2899.98]  He canceled my debts and he called me his friend.
[2899.98 --> 2906.98]  When death was arrested, my life began.
[2906.98 --> 2907.98]  When death was arrested, my life began.
[2907.98 --> 2908.98]  You have made me new.
[2908.98 --> 2913.98]  Now life begins with you.
[2913.98 --> 2914.98]  You have made me new.
[2914.98 --> 2920.98]  Now life begins with you.
[2920.98 --> 2939.98]  It's your endless love pouring down on us.
[2939.98 --> 2940.98]  You have made me new.
[2940.98 --> 2941.98]  You have made me new.
[2941.98 --> 2946.98]  Now life begins with you.
[2946.98 --> 2954.98]  You have made me new.
[2954.98 --> 2961.98]  A Savior displayed on a criminal's cross.
[2961.98 --> 2969.98]  Darkness rejoiced as the heavenly light.
[2969.98 --> 2975.98]  Then Jesus arose.
[2975.98 --> 2979.98]  With a great happy man
[2979.98 --> 2986.98]  There was a rest in my life
[2986.98 --> 2995.98]  Oh, your grace so free
[2995.98 --> 3000.98]  Washes over me
[3000.98 --> 3004.98]  You have made new
[3004.98 --> 3010.98]  Now life begins with you
[3010.98 --> 3016.98]  Your endless love
[3016.98 --> 3022.98]  Pouring down on us
[3022.98 --> 3026.98]  You have made us a dream
[3026.98 --> 3032.98]  Now life begins with you
[3032.98 --> 3038.98]  We're free, free, forever we're free

[3069.98 --> 3073.98]  And there was a rest in my life
[3073.98 --> 3090.98]  When death was a rest in my life
[3090.98 --> 3095.98]  When death was a rest in my life
[3095.98 --> 3100.98]  When death was a rest in my life
[3100.98 --> 3104.98]  When death was a rest in my life
[3104.98 --> 3109.98]  Yeah

[3137.98 --> 3138.98] ch
[3138.98 --> 3140.98]  Jekyll
[3140.98 --> 3144.98]  You have made us a dream
[3144.98 --> 3146.98]  Now life begins with you
[3147.98 --> 3149.98]  Let's do
[3149.98 --> 3154.98]  You have made us a dream
[3154.98 --> 3170.98]  Well, you may find your seats, or no.
[3170.98 --> 3172.38]  Am I not supposed to come up yet?
[3174.20 --> 3176.06]  We're just going to take a moment.
[3177.12 --> 3178.60]  We're just going to take a moment now.
[3179.20 --> 3181.42]  Give of our gifts, our financial gifts this morning.
[3181.42 --> 3186.56]  So I'm here to highlight who we're going to give our special offering to today,
[3186.92 --> 3188.18]  and that is World Renew.
[3188.72 --> 3192.60]  So World Renew is a relief and development agency
[3192.60 --> 3194.78]  who does a lot of disaster relief,
[3194.90 --> 3197.04]  and they work with communities helping them bring them
[3197.04 --> 3199.30]  into a place of sustainability out of poverty.
[3199.68 --> 3202.28]  And we actually had a lot of time with them this weekend.
[3202.52 --> 3205.76]  So we had Chris and Chitty here, and they had a booth at the back,
[3205.80 --> 3208.14]  and they interacted with a lot of us here at Reactivate.
[3208.14 --> 3211.78]  They even led a couple of sessions on what does it look like
[3211.78 --> 3214.52]  to interact with poverty and good ways to help
[3214.52 --> 3215.90]  and ways to think that through.
[3216.02 --> 3219.18]  So we're very thankful for the work that World Renew does
[3219.18 --> 3223.22]  and even what they were able to give back to us at Reactivate.
[3223.38 --> 3225.70]  So if we can all take a moment to give generously
[3225.70 --> 3228.40]  of our monetary gifts this morning, we can bless World Renew.
[3228.54 --> 3229.28]  Thank you very much.
[3229.28 --> 3229.36]  Thank you.
[3238.14 --> 3254.06]  All right.
[3254.20 --> 3256.78]  While the bags are being passed around
[3256.78 --> 3258.26]  and we're giving of our gifts,
[3258.72 --> 3262.00]  I'm wondering if there's any kids out there
[3262.00 --> 3265.98]  who are like aged three to maybe kindergarten,
[3265.98 --> 3268.54]  and I wonder if you can be brave enough
[3268.54 --> 3270.52]  and come up here and join me up front.
[3270.68 --> 3272.56]  I know church is a little fuller than normal,
[3272.78 --> 3275.86]  but I would love for you to come forward right now if you can
[3275.86 --> 3277.54]  and join me up front here.
[3278.02 --> 3281.08]  So if you're three to kindergarten, come on forward.
[3282.38 --> 3283.82]  I'd love to see your faces.
[3285.76 --> 3286.40]  Here we go.
[3286.46 --> 3287.08]  Here comes some.
[3291.66 --> 3293.78]  You can come and you can sit right up here.
[3293.78 --> 3293.84]  Here we go.
[3295.98 --> 3300.70]  Good morning.
[3300.98 --> 3302.56]  You guys are the brave ones, I think.
[3302.88 --> 3303.76]  How are we doing today?
[3304.74 --> 3305.62]  Are we doing good?
[3306.40 --> 3307.88]  Is church a little bit different today?
[3308.66 --> 3309.48]  Is that okay?
[3310.32 --> 3310.72]  Yeah?
[3311.56 --> 3314.02]  Was music a little louder than normal
[3314.02 --> 3317.02]  and the light's a little shinier than normal?
[3318.14 --> 3320.80]  It's fun to worship God in all sorts of ways, right?
[3320.84 --> 3322.62]  We can praise him in all sorts of ways.
[3322.62 --> 3323.80]  And you know what we're going to do right now?
[3323.80 --> 3326.96]  We're going to pray and then you kids can head into the back
[3326.96 --> 3329.66]  and we're still going to do children's worship time for you today, okay?
[3330.00 --> 3330.58]  Does that work?
[3331.14 --> 3331.96]  But I'm going to pray
[3331.96 --> 3334.64]  and the bags are still going to get passed while I pray
[3334.64 --> 3335.80]  and that's okay, everyone.
[3336.80 --> 3338.66]  As the bags are still getting passed, we're going to pray
[3338.66 --> 3339.64]  and then we're going to stand up
[3339.64 --> 3341.48]  and we're going to do the Lord's blessing, okay?
[3341.92 --> 3342.48]  Does that work?
[3342.48 --> 3343.86]  All right, let's bow our heads.
[3344.00 --> 3345.58]  Let's close our eyes and we're going to do a little prayer.
[3346.04 --> 3347.60]  God, thank you so much for this day.
[3348.12 --> 3350.76]  Thank you that we could have so many friends from all over BC
[3350.76 --> 3352.36]  join us for church this morning,
[3352.52 --> 3354.82]  that we could sing praises to your name
[3354.82 --> 3357.20]  and learn more about what it means to follow and love you.
[3357.38 --> 3359.70]  And we pray, Lord, that as we go to children's worship time
[3359.70 --> 3361.28]  and as the youth and the grown-ups,
[3361.38 --> 3363.32]  they stay back here and listen to Pastor Dave,
[3363.66 --> 3367.40]  that we will all learn more about you and how you love us.
[3367.96 --> 3370.56]  And we pray this in your son's precious and holy name.
[3371.36 --> 3371.72]  Amen.
[3372.70 --> 3373.76]  All right, we're going to stand
[3373.76 --> 3376.08]  and we're going to have to be extra loud today.
[3376.18 --> 3378.04]  I'm going to, in fact, actually, youth, you don't know this.
[3378.08 --> 3379.38]  You're all going to stand right now.
[3379.78 --> 3382.78]  The kids are going to say, the Lord be with you
[3382.78 --> 3385.70]  and then you're all going to reply with and also with you
[3385.70 --> 3387.76]  and you're going to hold your hands out to receive it, okay?
[3388.32 --> 3389.52]  All right, kids, are we ready?
[3389.60 --> 3390.36]  There's only a few of us.
[3390.40 --> 3391.22]  We have to be really loud.
[3391.32 --> 3391.90]  We'll say it together.
[3391.98 --> 3392.24]  You ready?
[3392.80 --> 3393.72]  One, two, three.
[3394.72 --> 3396.38]  The Lord be with you.
[3396.38 --> 3398.56]  And also with you.
[3398.86 --> 3400.64]  All right, we can head to children's worship time.
[3412.94 --> 3414.40]  Good morning.
[3414.74 --> 3418.06]  My name is Seth and I'm an elder here at Langley Emanuel
[3418.06 --> 3421.40]  and it's my privilege to lead us in our church family prayer.
[3422.24 --> 3425.28]  Kevin alluded a number of times to how church is different this morning
[3425.28 --> 3426.82]  and it's a wonderful thing.
[3427.06 --> 3427.94]  We're thankful for that.
[3428.54 --> 3432.42]  The feeling, the music, the sound, the smell.
[3434.42 --> 3435.30]  That's debatable.
[3435.64 --> 3438.60]  But our worship is a pleasing aroma to God,
[3438.68 --> 3440.28]  regardless of our earthly sense.
[3441.44 --> 3442.58]  Please join me in prayer.
[3442.58 --> 3449.90]  Father in heaven, we come before you today with hearts full of gratitude and reverence.
[3450.56 --> 3454.70]  We thank you for this day, a new opportunity to gather in your presence
[3454.70 --> 3456.52]  and to lift up your name in worship.
[3457.62 --> 3460.94]  Lord, we are especially grateful for the Reactivate Youth event this weekend.
[3461.66 --> 3465.96]  We thank you for providing so many dedicated volunteers to accomplish numerous tasks.
[3465.96 --> 3471.36]  We thank you for the energy, enthusiasm, and commitment of our youth and their leaders.
[3472.34 --> 3474.84]  We praise you for the ways you have moved in their lives,
[3475.18 --> 3477.60]  sparking new passions and deepening their faith.
[3478.58 --> 3482.18]  We ask that you continue to work powerfully in the hearts of our youth.
[3482.98 --> 3486.98]  May the seeds planted during this event grow and bear fruit in their lives.
[3487.96 --> 3490.04]  Inspire them to pursue you with zeal
[3490.04 --> 3493.22]  and to live out their faith with courage and conviction.
[3494.52 --> 3498.68]  May they continue to set an example for us in speech, in conduct,
[3499.04 --> 3501.22]  in love, in faith, and in purity.
[3502.60 --> 3505.90]  Empower their leaders with wisdom, patience, and love
[3505.90 --> 3508.04]  as they guide and mentor these young people.
[3509.60 --> 3513.34]  We pray for our leaders, both within the church and beyond.
[3514.20 --> 3516.16]  Grant them discernment and strength
[3516.16 --> 3519.06]  as they navigate the challenges and opportunities before them.
[3520.04 --> 3522.78]  Give them the courage to stand firm in your truth
[3522.78 --> 3524.66]  while leading with grace and humility.
[3526.18 --> 3528.78]  We also pray for our community and the world.
[3530.04 --> 3532.06]  May your justice roll down like waters
[3532.06 --> 3534.58]  and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.
[3535.58 --> 3538.58]  We ask for your peace to reign in places of conflict
[3538.58 --> 3541.96]  and for your grace to abound in places of despair.
[3543.30 --> 3545.46]  Use us as instruments of your peace
[3545.46 --> 3547.26]  and ambassadors of your kingdom.
[3547.26 --> 3551.12]  Help us to be a community that reflects your love,
[3551.42 --> 3552.94]  compassion, and justice.
[3553.64 --> 3555.52]  May we be a light to those around us,
[3555.98 --> 3558.44]  demonstrating the hope and grace that we have found in you.
[3560.38 --> 3562.44]  Lord, we lift up our congregation to you,
[3562.96 --> 3564.72]  asking for your healing touch upon those
[3564.72 --> 3567.46]  who are suffering in body, mind, or spirit.
[3567.46 --> 3571.44]  We are thankful for news of Peter's successful surgery
[3571.44 --> 3573.34]  and ask for continued healing.
[3574.04 --> 3576.38]  We also pray for Emo's upcoming surgery.
[3577.14 --> 3580.34]  Please give Emo your peace and strength and bring healing.
[3581.30 --> 3584.00]  Be near to Ashley as well with her recent diagnosis.
[3585.92 --> 3587.02]  Comfort those who are grieving.
[3587.92 --> 3589.32]  Provide for those who are in need
[3589.32 --> 3591.22]  and bring peace to those who are troubled.
[3591.22 --> 3594.94]  May those who are unable to join us today,
[3595.24 --> 3597.30]  whether because they're shut in or for other reasons,
[3597.80 --> 3600.84]  may they feel your presence in profound and tangible ways.
[3601.82 --> 3603.78]  We also ask that as the school year
[3603.78 --> 3605.62]  and the church ministry year gets underway,
[3605.94 --> 3607.62]  that all will experience your goodness.
[3609.44 --> 3611.18]  As we gather as a church family,
[3611.56 --> 3613.58]  we also seek your guidance and wisdom.
[3614.76 --> 3616.46]  Illuminate our hearts and minds
[3616.46 --> 3618.84]  as we seek to understand your word more deeply
[3618.84 --> 3621.12]  and to apply it faithfully in our lives.
[3622.20 --> 3624.34]  Open our hearts to the truth of your word.
[3625.78 --> 3627.88]  Transform us by the renewing of our minds
[3627.88 --> 3630.60]  so that we might live lives that are pleasing to you.
[3631.66 --> 3634.70]  Help us to grow in faith, hope, and love,
[3635.02 --> 3637.12]  and to build each other up in our journey with you.
[3638.94 --> 3641.38]  Father, we are grateful for your constant presence
[3641.38 --> 3643.00]  and your unending grace.
[3643.74 --> 3646.70]  We commit this time of worship and fellowship into your hands,
[3646.70 --> 3649.40]  trusting that you will be honored in all that we do.
[3650.20 --> 3653.22]  We pray all these things in the name of your son, Jesus Christ.
[3654.02 --> 3654.28]  Amen.
[3662.74 --> 3663.96]  Well, good morning, everyone.
[3664.90 --> 3666.12]  Oh, you sound tired.
[3666.12 --> 3669.10]  For those who are part of Emmanuel,
[3669.18 --> 3670.08]  my name is Dave Gruen.
[3670.20 --> 3671.82]  I'm one of the pastors at Hope Community Church
[3671.82 --> 3672.64]  just down the road.
[3672.76 --> 3674.24]  And I want to say to Emmanuel,
[3674.40 --> 3675.78]  thank you for your hospitality.
[3676.72 --> 3679.44]  I have gotten to know what I feel like half of your church now
[3679.44 --> 3680.90]  because of all the different ways
[3680.90 --> 3682.72]  that you have served and cared for us.
[3682.96 --> 3684.22]  And so I just want to speak on behalf
[3684.22 --> 3685.78]  of all the churches represented here
[3685.78 --> 3688.14]  by saying thank you for your generous hospitality.
[3688.60 --> 3690.72]  And we're going to give Emmanuel a round of applause.
[3690.72 --> 3690.98]  Thank you.
[3690.98 --> 3691.08]  Thank you.
[3691.08 --> 3691.22]  Thank you.
[3691.22 --> 3691.28]  Thank you.
[3691.28 --> 3691.38]  Thank you.
[3691.38 --> 3691.44]  Thank you.
[3691.44 --> 3691.48]  Thank you.
[3691.48 --> 3691.54]  Thank you.
[3691.54 --> 3691.58]  Thank you.
[3691.58 --> 3691.62]  Thank you.
[3691.62 --> 3691.68]  Thank you.
[3691.68 --> 3691.74]  Thank you.
[3691.74 --> 3692.18]  Thank you.
[3692.18 --> 3692.68]  Thank you.
[3692.68 --> 3693.18]  Thank you.
[3693.18 --> 3693.24]  Thank you.
[3693.24 --> 3693.78]  Thank you.
[3693.78 --> 3696.78]  Thank you.
[3696.78 --> 3697.22]  Thank you.
[3697.22 --> 3698.26]  Throughout the course of this weekend,
[3698.26 --> 3700.36]  the theme of reactivate has been revealed
[3700.36 --> 3701.96]  and we've been exploring how it is
[3701.96 --> 3703.68]  that Jesus is revealed to us.
[3703.78 --> 3704.26]  On Friday,
[3704.50 --> 3706.06]  I'm sure all the students remember this perfectly.
[3706.62 --> 3708.62]  We looked at how Jesus was revealed to us
[3708.62 --> 3711.18]  as our great prophet who speaks God's word.
[3711.76 --> 3712.10]  Yesterday,
[3712.32 --> 3714.12]  we looked at how Jesus is revealed to us
[3714.12 --> 3715.32]  as our great high priest
[3715.32 --> 3717.00]  whose perfect sacrifice
[3717.00 --> 3719.38]  opens up the presence of God to us.
[3719.80 --> 3720.48]  And this morning,
[3720.54 --> 3721.28]  we're going to be looking at
[3721.28 --> 3723.78]  how Jesus is our great King.
[3724.54 --> 3725.44]  And if you have a Bible,
[3725.58 --> 3727.34]  you can turn with me to Acts chapter one.
[3727.66 --> 3728.76]  It's also going to be on the screen
[3728.76 --> 3730.44]  if you just want to follow along with me.
[3731.28 --> 3733.38]  It's the first 11 verses of Acts chapter one.
[3735.96 --> 3738.06]  In my former book, Theophilus,
[3738.14 --> 3740.80]  I wrote about all that Jesus began to do
[3740.80 --> 3743.26]  and to teach until the day he was taken up to heaven.
[3743.62 --> 3745.82]  After giving instructions to the Holy Spirit,
[3745.82 --> 3747.18]  to the apostles he had chosen.
[3748.02 --> 3748.90]  After his suffering,
[3748.90 --> 3750.24]  he presented himself to them
[3750.24 --> 3751.98]  and gave many convincing proofs
[3751.98 --> 3753.60]  that he was alive.
[3754.14 --> 3755.02]  He appeared to them
[3755.02 --> 3756.42]  over the period of 40 days
[3756.42 --> 3758.06]  and spoke about the kingdom of God.
[3758.82 --> 3759.40]  On one occasion,
[3759.52 --> 3760.34]  while he was with them,
[3760.38 --> 3761.30]  he gave this command,
[3762.14 --> 3763.16]  do not leave Jerusalem,
[3763.76 --> 3765.94]  but wait for the gift my father promised,
[3766.08 --> 3767.72]  which you have heard me speak about.
[3768.20 --> 3769.82]  For John baptized with water,
[3769.94 --> 3770.94]  but in a few days,
[3771.34 --> 3773.48]  you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.
[3774.58 --> 3775.62]  So when they met together,
[3775.62 --> 3776.74]  they asked him,
[3776.78 --> 3778.00]  Lord, are you at this time
[3778.00 --> 3780.08]  going to restore the kingdom to Israel?
[3780.96 --> 3781.58]  He said to them,
[3781.58 --> 3783.04]  it's not for you to know the times
[3783.04 --> 3784.38]  and the dates the father has set
[3784.38 --> 3785.66]  by his own authority,
[3786.50 --> 3788.10]  but you will receive power
[3788.10 --> 3789.84]  when the Holy Spirit comes on you
[3789.84 --> 3792.56]  and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem
[3792.56 --> 3794.62]  and all Judea and Samaria
[3794.62 --> 3796.52]  and to the ends of the earth.
[3797.34 --> 3798.16]  After he said this,
[3798.20 --> 3799.98]  he was taken up before their very eyes
[3799.98 --> 3801.94]  and a cloud hid him from their sight.
[3801.94 --> 3804.70]  They were looking intently up into the sky
[3804.70 --> 3805.46]  as he was going
[3805.46 --> 3807.38]  when suddenly two men dressed in white
[3807.38 --> 3808.78]  stood beside them.
[3809.56 --> 3810.92]  Men of Galilee, they said,
[3811.04 --> 3813.42]  why do you stand here looking into the sky?
[3813.82 --> 3816.64]  The same Jesus who has been taken from you into heaven
[3816.64 --> 3819.12]  will come back in the same way
[3819.12 --> 3821.14]  you have seen him go into heaven.
[3821.56 --> 3822.48]  This is God's word.
[3825.28 --> 3827.00]  Well, I mentioned on Friday night
[3827.00 --> 3828.64]  that a number of years ago,
[3828.82 --> 3829.88]  for a few years,
[3829.88 --> 3832.62]  I led a Bible study for international students.
[3833.04 --> 3834.96]  My church, where's New West CRC?
[3835.54 --> 3836.58]  My church, New West.
[3836.64 --> 3837.08]  There we are.
[3837.14 --> 3837.96]  My former church.
[3838.34 --> 3839.56]  We had a number of students
[3839.56 --> 3841.24]  who are part of Simon Fraser University
[3841.24 --> 3843.58]  and they were just sort of learning English,
[3843.76 --> 3845.36]  learning what Christianity was about.
[3845.44 --> 3846.60]  And a number of them were saying,
[3846.72 --> 3847.86]  we'll do a Bible study.
[3847.96 --> 3850.78]  So we had a student from Iraq, Iran, China,
[3850.92 --> 3853.34]  and Japan in that Bible study.
[3853.94 --> 3855.68]  And I remember very vividly,
[3855.76 --> 3857.86]  near the end of our study on the book of Mark,
[3857.86 --> 3860.10]  we were talking about the death and resurrection of Jesus,
[3860.28 --> 3863.10]  like my most favorite thing to talk about.
[3863.60 --> 3865.66]  And there's a lot of questions around,
[3865.78 --> 3867.44]  like how did the resurrection happen,
[3867.72 --> 3869.36]  what to make of it, what it means.
[3869.62 --> 3872.28]  And then there's this Japanese student named Naoko.
[3873.20 --> 3875.28]  She didn't say much with the whole Bible study
[3875.28 --> 3876.50]  until the very end.
[3876.64 --> 3878.18]  And this was her question.
[3878.50 --> 3879.28]  She said,
[3879.28 --> 3883.40]  where is Jesus right now?
[3883.88 --> 3885.70]  And what is he doing?
[3886.88 --> 3888.38]  Isn't that such a good question?
[3888.88 --> 3889.76]  And I remember like,
[3889.86 --> 3891.28]  not prepared for that, by the way.
[3891.30 --> 3891.82]  And I'm just like,
[3891.88 --> 3893.00]  I bumbled out an answer.
[3893.20 --> 3895.88]  But before I even say anything about this question,
[3896.14 --> 3897.98]  what would you say to someone
[3897.98 --> 3899.16]  who is not a Christian,
[3899.40 --> 3900.52]  did not grow up in the church,
[3900.54 --> 3901.66]  who asked you the question,
[3902.28 --> 3904.10]  where is Jesus right now?
[3905.00 --> 3906.68]  And what is he doing?
[3908.12 --> 3909.70]  That's what we're going to explore this morning
[3909.70 --> 3911.00]  as we look at Acts 1
[3911.00 --> 3913.62]  and a few other verses about Jesus.
[3913.86 --> 3915.32]  And I'll just give you a brief overview
[3915.32 --> 3916.12]  of where we're going.
[3916.74 --> 3918.04]  And I was told by Chris,
[3918.16 --> 3918.60]  Pastor Chris,
[3918.66 --> 3920.58]  that he usually preaches for 40 to 45 minutes.
[3920.72 --> 3922.72]  So we're going to go for about 45 minutes.
[3923.46 --> 3925.14]  Oh, we'll see if I can get into that.
[3925.18 --> 3925.96]  But this is where we're going.
[3926.76 --> 3927.30]  Number one,
[3927.52 --> 3928.80]  Jesus right now
[3928.80 --> 3931.26]  is a king who's ruling the world
[3931.26 --> 3933.00]  with love, justice, and mercy.
[3933.00 --> 3934.30]  Number two,
[3934.36 --> 3936.34]  we're going to look at how Jesus right now
[3936.34 --> 3938.06]  is engaged in the work
[3938.06 --> 3940.64]  of interceding for you and I as his children.
[3941.64 --> 3942.08]  And third,
[3942.34 --> 3944.56]  we're going to look at how Jesus is equipping us
[3944.56 --> 3946.56]  right now by his spirit
[3946.56 --> 3948.44]  for mission in his world.
[3949.90 --> 3951.70]  Just before we dive into the passage,
[3951.78 --> 3954.30]  I want to say one thing about Acts 1.
[3954.94 --> 3956.46]  I want you to know that the disciples
[3956.46 --> 3957.48]  who followed Jesus,
[3958.00 --> 3959.76]  when he went to be with the Father
[3959.76 --> 3960.66]  and ascended to heaven,
[3960.66 --> 3962.68]  they would have been probably confused
[3962.68 --> 3964.50]  and deeply disappointed.
[3965.40 --> 3966.80]  I mean, just put yourself in their shoes
[3966.80 --> 3967.54]  for one moment.
[3967.64 --> 3969.14]  They followed this guy for three years.
[3969.24 --> 3970.24]  They gave up everything
[3970.24 --> 3972.56]  to be committed to this movement of Jesus
[3972.56 --> 3974.86]  with some confusion about where it goes.
[3975.62 --> 3977.90]  They went through the gut-wrenching agony
[3977.90 --> 3979.82]  of watching their leader get crucified,
[3980.40 --> 3981.60]  dead on a cross.
[3981.84 --> 3983.84]  And then they went through the overwhelming joy
[3983.84 --> 3985.52]  of Jesus then coming back to life.
[3985.68 --> 3987.92]  And they had this sweet 40 days,
[3988.02 --> 3988.94]  we read in this passage,
[3988.94 --> 3990.84]  of Jesus going around the city,
[3991.34 --> 3992.66]  telling people he's alive,
[3992.72 --> 3994.14]  in his resurrected body,
[3994.14 --> 3997.86]  and then, poof, Jesus is gone.
[3998.94 --> 4000.86]  What they wanted of Jesus
[4000.86 --> 4003.38]  is to continue doing what's going on.
[4003.48 --> 4005.84]  They wanted Jesus to be the new King David,
[4006.10 --> 4007.68]  sitting on a throne in Jerusalem,
[4007.90 --> 4009.20]  establishing Israel
[4009.20 --> 4011.14]  and making the city great again.
[4011.76 --> 4012.88]  And then Jesus leaves.
[4012.88 --> 4013.88]  And what he says to them is,
[4014.32 --> 4015.12]  here's my blessing.
[4016.04 --> 4017.18]  You're going to be my witnesses.
[4017.78 --> 4019.50]  And off he goes to be with the Father.
[4019.62 --> 4022.14]  They must have been so confused.
[4023.54 --> 4025.76]  But Acts 1 answers the first half
[4025.76 --> 4027.44]  of Naoko's question, right?
[4027.84 --> 4029.52]  Her question was, where is Jesus?
[4029.64 --> 4031.76]  And what do the two men dressed in white,
[4032.06 --> 4033.68]  the two angels say to the disciples?
[4035.26 --> 4036.04]  He's in heaven.
[4037.22 --> 4039.28]  Jesus Christ is in heaven.
[4039.58 --> 4041.36]  And maybe if you're honest with yourself,
[4041.36 --> 4043.66]  you might have the question, well, where is that?
[4043.94 --> 4045.16]  Like, what is heaven?
[4045.26 --> 4046.94]  When I gave this answer to Naoko,
[4047.08 --> 4049.26]  she had 10 more questions about heaven.
[4049.40 --> 4050.76]  And I'm going to just say briefly,
[4051.34 --> 4052.98]  oftentimes we imagine heaven
[4052.98 --> 4055.80]  as sort of this ethereal place beyond the clouds.
[4056.14 --> 4058.26]  It's sort of this hard to imagine place.
[4059.04 --> 4060.14]  There's mystery around heaven,
[4060.22 --> 4061.14]  but what I'll say is this.
[4061.20 --> 4063.16]  It is deeply interlocked
[4063.16 --> 4066.34]  and interweaving with our lives on earth.
[4066.82 --> 4067.78]  I do not believe that heaven
[4067.78 --> 4070.70]  is some far off disconnected place from our reality.
[4070.70 --> 4073.64]  It's interlocked and interweaving with earth.
[4073.74 --> 4074.68]  Whatever that looks like,
[4074.92 --> 4076.90]  that's how I believe the scriptures present heaven.
[4077.52 --> 4078.68]  One writer I really love,
[4078.74 --> 4081.84]  he says that heaven is the control room for earth.
[4082.44 --> 4084.34]  And I wrote this down so not to forget it.
[4084.38 --> 4085.68]  When I taught youth about heaven,
[4086.04 --> 4087.78]  one of them said back to me recently,
[4088.00 --> 4089.40]  it's kind of like Stranger Things.
[4089.92 --> 4091.38]  Now, I haven't seen Stranger Things,
[4091.58 --> 4093.58]  but maybe that's a good sort of connection point
[4093.58 --> 4095.24]  in terms of the interlocking nature
[4095.24 --> 4096.70]  of heaven and on earth.
[4096.70 --> 4099.02]  Jesus is in heaven.
[4099.54 --> 4100.64]  And what you need to know is
[4100.64 --> 4101.74]  Jesus' ultimate purpose
[4101.74 --> 4105.08]  is the perfect unity of heaven and earth, right?
[4105.12 --> 4106.16]  That's what we pray for.
[4106.42 --> 4107.54]  When we pray the Lord's Prayer,
[4107.64 --> 4110.86]  your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[4111.28 --> 4113.94]  And when Jesus comes back in glory and power
[4113.94 --> 4115.78]  at the end to restore all things,
[4116.18 --> 4118.64]  heaven and earth will be perfectly united.
[4118.64 --> 4120.20]  And we will experience heaven
[4120.20 --> 4122.92]  in our lives on a new earth.
[4123.74 --> 4125.30]  So Jesus is in heaven.
[4125.76 --> 4128.00]  Now, we're going to ask the second half
[4128.00 --> 4129.02]  of Naoko's question,
[4129.48 --> 4132.16]  what is Jesus doing in heaven,
[4132.28 --> 4133.54]  the control room for earth?
[4133.70 --> 4135.58]  What is Jesus giving his time to?
[4135.64 --> 4137.10]  This might be one of the most important questions
[4137.10 --> 4138.24]  you've never asked.
[4138.90 --> 4140.60]  And the first answer to that
[4140.60 --> 4143.90]  is Jesus is ruling over this creation
[4143.90 --> 4148.22]  with love and justice and power.
[4148.22 --> 4150.48]  This creation, Ephesians says,
[4150.54 --> 4151.88]  is held together
[4151.88 --> 4154.32]  because Jesus gives it life
[4154.32 --> 4155.88]  and gives us life
[4155.88 --> 4156.82]  and allows us to live.
[4156.88 --> 4157.46]  Without Jesus,
[4157.66 --> 4159.68]  you sort of unplug Jesus from this world,
[4159.98 --> 4161.12]  everything implodes.
[4161.40 --> 4163.54]  That's how important his rule is over the world.
[4164.34 --> 4167.44]  So many passages in the Bible
[4167.44 --> 4169.44]  celebrate the authority
[4169.44 --> 4171.88]  and the kingship of Jesus over creation.
[4172.20 --> 4173.38]  I want to read just one of them
[4173.38 --> 4174.60]  that I touched on last night
[4174.60 --> 4175.88]  from Ephesians 1.
[4175.88 --> 4178.46]  That's what we read in Ephesians 1.
[4179.04 --> 4179.86]  That power,
[4180.72 --> 4182.90]  the same power that he exerted,
[4182.94 --> 4183.52]  that's God,
[4183.62 --> 4185.32]  when he raised Christ from the dead
[4185.32 --> 4187.78]  and seated him at his right hand
[4187.78 --> 4188.98]  in the heavenly realms,
[4189.32 --> 4191.84]  far above any rule and authority,
[4192.50 --> 4193.76]  power and dominion,
[4194.04 --> 4195.78]  and every name that can be invoked,
[4195.96 --> 4197.82]  not only in the present age,
[4197.98 --> 4200.48]  but also in the one to come.
[4200.48 --> 4203.18]  Can I just invite you to allow that
[4203.18 --> 4205.84]  to expand your vision of Jesus, right?
[4206.64 --> 4207.74]  What the author of Hebrews,
[4208.00 --> 4210.84]  of Ephesians and Romans and Hebrews
[4210.84 --> 4211.84]  are all trying to say is
[4211.84 --> 4214.22]  Jesus is above every name,
[4214.60 --> 4215.40]  every authority,
[4215.70 --> 4216.56]  every world leader,
[4216.92 --> 4218.16]  every spiritual force
[4218.16 --> 4219.78]  that could be invoked now and forever.
[4220.02 --> 4221.90]  He's above all those things.
[4222.66 --> 4223.26]  And Ephesians says,
[4223.36 --> 4226.12]  all things are placed under Jesus' feet.
[4226.42 --> 4227.34]  That's the authority
[4227.34 --> 4228.98]  of the Jesus we worship this morning.
[4230.04 --> 4232.30]  No rival can take Jesus down.
[4232.56 --> 4233.50]  No one can kill him
[4233.50 --> 4234.96]  because that's already been done
[4234.96 --> 4236.60]  and Jesus came back from the grave
[4236.60 --> 4238.28]  to rule over all things.
[4239.94 --> 4241.88]  There's a writer I read two years ago.
[4243.34 --> 4245.14]  His name is David Levithan.
[4245.20 --> 4245.66]  Maybe you know him.
[4245.68 --> 4247.50]  He's actually a famous American journalist
[4247.50 --> 4248.08]  and author
[4248.08 --> 4249.60]  and not a Christian.
[4250.12 --> 4251.18]  And this is what he writes
[4251.18 --> 4251.78]  about the universe.
[4251.92 --> 4253.94]  This is just like a startling statement
[4253.94 --> 4255.16]  that we need to respond to.
[4255.16 --> 4255.52]  He says,
[4255.62 --> 4257.62]  if you stare at the universe,
[4258.08 --> 4259.58]  the center of the universe,
[4259.92 --> 4261.86]  you will find coldness there.
[4263.60 --> 4264.08]  Blankness.
[4264.96 --> 4266.00]  Ultimately, he writes,
[4266.10 --> 4269.22]  the universe does not care for us at all.
[4269.40 --> 4270.38]  And then he goes on to say,
[4270.54 --> 4271.76]  that's why we have to take care
[4271.76 --> 4272.54]  of our own lives.
[4272.84 --> 4274.84]  And over and against that statement,
[4274.96 --> 4276.10]  which I think is very depressing,
[4276.52 --> 4277.56]  all of us can say,
[4277.68 --> 4279.08]  at the center of the universe
[4279.08 --> 4281.54]  is a living resurrected king
[4281.54 --> 4283.04]  in a resurrected body
[4283.04 --> 4285.62]  who holds all things together
[4285.62 --> 4288.22]  and governs everything in this world
[4288.22 --> 4289.36]  according to his purpose
[4289.36 --> 4291.94]  and his will will be done.
[4292.70 --> 4293.70]  That's your king.
[4294.20 --> 4295.22]  That's King Jesus.
[4297.68 --> 4298.16]  Secondly,
[4298.30 --> 4300.16]  so the first thing about Jesus' kingship
[4300.16 --> 4302.46]  is he's right now ruling over creation
[4302.46 --> 4303.78]  and it's all held together
[4303.78 --> 4305.08]  by his power and his goodness
[4305.08 --> 4305.82]  and his justice.
[4306.34 --> 4306.78]  Secondly,
[4307.26 --> 4308.20]  the scriptures teach us
[4308.20 --> 4310.04]  that at this very moment,
[4310.64 --> 4312.72]  Jesus is interceding for you
[4312.72 --> 4313.86]  and for me.
[4314.70 --> 4315.76]  Just take that in for a minute.
[4316.46 --> 4317.48]  That's what he's doing right now.
[4317.84 --> 4319.78]  Like the present tense ministry of Jesus
[4319.78 --> 4321.24]  is interceding for us.
[4321.26 --> 4322.68]  Let me read us a verse
[4322.68 --> 4324.06]  from Romans chapter eight.
[4324.54 --> 4326.12]  This is so powerful on so many levels.
[4326.66 --> 4327.82]  We read from Romans eight,
[4327.82 --> 4329.80]  who will bring any charge
[4329.80 --> 4331.52]  against those whom God has chosen?
[4332.20 --> 4333.94]  It's God who justifies.
[4333.94 --> 4336.42]  Who then is the one who can condemn?
[4337.12 --> 4337.86]  No one.
[4338.58 --> 4340.14]  It's Jesus Christ who died.
[4340.30 --> 4340.86]  More than that,
[4340.94 --> 4342.48]  who was raised to life
[4342.48 --> 4343.72]  is at the right hand of God.
[4343.80 --> 4344.58]  And listen to this,
[4345.18 --> 4348.38]  and is also interceding for us.
[4348.40 --> 4349.36]  And that is actually a phrase
[4349.36 --> 4351.38]  repeated in multiple passages.
[4352.04 --> 4353.48]  The Jesus who defeated death,
[4353.78 --> 4354.68]  the Jesus who is now
[4354.68 --> 4355.66]  at the right hand of the father
[4355.66 --> 4357.36]  is giving his time
[4357.36 --> 4358.96]  to intercede for you.
[4359.76 --> 4360.32]  And this, by the way,
[4360.34 --> 4361.08]  if you're here last night,
[4361.16 --> 4362.04]  this weaves together
[4362.04 --> 4363.72]  the priestly ministry of Jesus
[4363.72 --> 4365.26]  of interceding,
[4365.64 --> 4367.72]  of taking our concerns to God.
[4367.82 --> 4369.38]  Jesus is doing that very thing
[4369.38 --> 4370.98]  at the right hand of the father.
[4373.32 --> 4374.84]  Recently, I came across an artist
[4374.84 --> 4376.48]  whose name is Elizabeth Wang,
[4376.98 --> 4377.94]  Chinese artist,
[4378.36 --> 4379.84]  also a Catholic artist.
[4380.04 --> 4383.36]  And she has done like 10 pieces of art
[4383.36 --> 4385.54]  on the intercessory work of Jesus now.
[4385.60 --> 4386.68]  And I haven't actually come across
[4386.68 --> 4387.96]  a lot of art on this,
[4388.06 --> 4389.10]  but I think it's on the screen
[4389.10 --> 4390.14]  or it will be on the screen.
[4390.78 --> 4391.40]  There it is.
[4391.40 --> 4392.58]  Oh, it's not as huge
[4392.58 --> 4393.32]  as I'd like it to be,
[4393.44 --> 4395.38]  but I can walk us through it.
[4395.44 --> 4397.86]  So she's depicting a person praying.
[4397.98 --> 4398.54]  See at the bottom,
[4398.66 --> 4399.36]  the silhouette there,
[4399.44 --> 4400.02]  the person praying.
[4400.08 --> 4400.88]  There's a sense of like,
[4401.16 --> 4402.36]  they are in their life.
[4402.62 --> 4403.32]  There's almost a sense
[4403.32 --> 4404.80]  of being downcast in prayer
[4404.80 --> 4405.86]  and burdened by life.
[4406.04 --> 4406.76]  And then what do you see
[4406.76 --> 4407.20]  at the center?
[4407.20 --> 4410.54]  You see this huge Jesus, right?
[4410.74 --> 4412.60]  You see the nail holes in his hands
[4412.60 --> 4415.16]  and then you see the presence of God above him.
[4415.22 --> 4416.84]  And Jesus is just taking that prayer
[4416.84 --> 4419.00]  from us broken, weak humans
[4419.00 --> 4421.00]  and he's bringing it to the father,
[4421.52 --> 4423.00]  interceding on our behalf.
[4423.38 --> 4426.44]  Is that how you picture Jesus right now
[4426.44 --> 4428.08]  on behalf of the church,
[4428.42 --> 4429.86]  on behalf of our brokenness?
[4429.86 --> 4431.84]  That's the beauty of your savior,
[4432.44 --> 4432.90]  your king.
[4435.82 --> 4438.78]  Now I want to talk about the third thing
[4438.78 --> 4440.76]  that Jesus is doing right now
[4440.76 --> 4441.82]  in heaven,
[4442.08 --> 4442.90]  in real time.
[4443.32 --> 4444.96]  And that is equipping us
[4444.96 --> 4446.26]  for mission.
[4446.96 --> 4448.44]  Equipping every single one of us
[4448.44 --> 4449.82]  from the youngest to the oldest
[4449.82 --> 4451.46]  for ministry by the power
[4451.46 --> 4452.30]  of the Holy Spirit.
[4453.10 --> 4454.98]  In fact, there's this like strange verse
[4454.98 --> 4456.56]  in John chapter 14
[4456.56 --> 4459.02]  where Jesus is preparing his disciples
[4459.02 --> 4460.58]  for his leaving.
[4460.72 --> 4461.52]  He says, I'm going to die,
[4461.58 --> 4462.50]  I'm going to rise and depart
[4462.50 --> 4464.28]  and then I'm going to ascend you to the spirit.
[4464.40 --> 4465.22]  And then he says this,
[4465.32 --> 4466.78]  it's better that I go.
[4467.48 --> 4468.26]  And the disciples are like,
[4468.30 --> 4469.78]  they're not buying that for one second.
[4469.94 --> 4470.92]  They're like, it's not better
[4470.92 --> 4471.66]  that you go, Jesus.
[4471.74 --> 4473.10]  We want you to stay right where you are.
[4473.30 --> 4474.90]  We want you to reestablish Israel.
[4475.02 --> 4476.28]  Jesus is like, it's better that I go.
[4476.28 --> 4477.22]  What does he say next?
[4478.68 --> 4482.28]  For you will do greater things than these.
[4483.30 --> 4484.38]  And most of us are like,
[4484.44 --> 4485.58]  I don't know if I believe that either.
[4485.90 --> 4487.14]  But what Jesus knows
[4487.14 --> 4489.10]  that the church does not yet know
[4489.10 --> 4490.72]  is that he's going to ascend
[4490.72 --> 4491.50]  to be with the Father.
[4491.66 --> 4493.18]  And the first thing he's going to do
[4493.18 --> 4495.04]  is pour out the very power
[4495.04 --> 4495.84]  of the resurrection
[4495.84 --> 4498.20]  through the Holy Spirit on the church
[4498.20 --> 4499.84]  so that they can do,
[4500.66 --> 4502.04]  that we can do
[4502.04 --> 4505.36]  the same things that Jesus did.
[4507.18 --> 4509.14]  John Mark Homer, an author I quite like,
[4509.24 --> 4510.44]  he describes discipleship
[4510.44 --> 4512.00]  in three simple phrases.
[4512.80 --> 4514.34]  Discipleship is being with Jesus,
[4515.46 --> 4517.36]  it's becoming like Jesus in our character,
[4517.98 --> 4520.78]  and it is doing what Jesus did.
[4521.16 --> 4522.96]  When Jesus ascends to be with the Father
[4522.96 --> 4524.28]  and he pours out his Spirit,
[4524.60 --> 4526.14]  he says to all of his believers,
[4526.64 --> 4528.66]  you now get to do
[4528.66 --> 4530.90]  what I have done
[4530.90 --> 4532.40]  by my Spirit.
[4532.88 --> 4534.56]  And that's a word for every single one of us
[4534.56 --> 4535.10]  this morning.
[4536.22 --> 4537.82]  And now for the next few minutes,
[4537.82 --> 4538.62]  I'm going to wrap up
[4538.62 --> 4540.30]  not just this morning's message,
[4540.62 --> 4541.94]  but all three talks
[4541.94 --> 4543.72]  on Jesus as our prophet,
[4544.06 --> 4544.74]  our priest,
[4544.92 --> 4545.58]  and our king
[4545.58 --> 4546.56]  by saying that Jesus
[4546.56 --> 4549.00]  invites every single one of us
[4549.00 --> 4551.22]  into the ministry of prophecy,
[4552.36 --> 4553.24]  of priestliness,
[4553.98 --> 4555.04]  and of his kingship.
[4555.16 --> 4555.78]  Do you know this?
[4556.52 --> 4557.56]  Jesus invites us now
[4557.56 --> 4558.98]  to do what he does.
[4559.06 --> 4560.44]  This is what it means in Acts 1
[4560.44 --> 4561.16]  when Jesus says,
[4561.16 --> 4562.14]  your identity
[4562.14 --> 4564.66]  is to be my witnesses.
[4565.94 --> 4567.40]  You now get to share
[4567.40 --> 4567.96]  in the ministry
[4567.96 --> 4569.36]  of his prophetic words,
[4569.68 --> 4571.20]  of his priestly intercession,
[4571.56 --> 4572.76]  and his kingly rule.
[4573.30 --> 4573.92]  And is it okay now
[4573.92 --> 4574.68]  if I take a few minutes
[4574.68 --> 4575.38]  to tease that out?
[4577.32 --> 4578.26]  You church,
[4578.56 --> 4579.22]  along with me,
[4579.32 --> 4580.48]  get to be the ones
[4580.48 --> 4581.68]  who just like Jesus,
[4582.28 --> 4584.08]  speak God's word.
[4584.44 --> 4584.62]  Right?
[4585.04 --> 4585.68]  On Friday night,
[4585.72 --> 4586.24]  we looked at how
[4586.24 --> 4587.38]  the primary work
[4587.38 --> 4588.04]  of a prophet
[4588.04 --> 4589.08]  in the Old Testament
[4589.08 --> 4591.48]  was to speak God's word.
[4591.84 --> 4593.12]  And every single one of us
[4593.12 --> 4594.80]  is invited to teach it
[4594.80 --> 4595.98]  to those who God
[4595.98 --> 4597.96]  puts authority under us,
[4598.08 --> 4599.30]  as well as to share it
[4599.30 --> 4600.22]  with those around us.
[4600.48 --> 4601.04]  And here's why
[4601.04 --> 4601.74]  I'm going to pause
[4601.74 --> 4602.36]  and say,
[4603.08 --> 4604.06]  praise the Lord
[4604.06 --> 4605.46]  for every youth leader
[4605.46 --> 4606.02]  in this room.
[4606.08 --> 4606.38]  And actually,
[4606.44 --> 4607.30]  I want the youth leaders
[4607.30 --> 4607.74]  who are here
[4607.74 --> 4608.72]  to raise their hands.
[4609.80 --> 4610.46]  There you are.
[4610.64 --> 4612.16]  I am so thankful
[4612.16 --> 4613.38]  for what you do
[4613.38 --> 4614.68]  like on Tuesday nights
[4614.68 --> 4615.48]  and Thursday nights
[4615.48 --> 4616.32]  and Friday nights
[4616.32 --> 4617.88]  in like church basements
[4617.88 --> 4618.74]  and living rooms
[4618.74 --> 4619.50]  of people in the church.
[4619.78 --> 4620.66]  You are teaching
[4620.66 --> 4621.30]  the scriptures
[4621.30 --> 4623.50]  to this next generation
[4623.50 --> 4624.40]  and that is one
[4624.40 --> 4626.12]  of the most essential tasks
[4626.12 --> 4627.22]  for the church today.
[4627.34 --> 4628.46]  I praise the Lord for you.
[4628.80 --> 4630.46]  And you are doing exactly
[4630.46 --> 4631.96]  what the prophetic ministry
[4631.96 --> 4633.32]  of Jesus is all about.
[4633.46 --> 4634.36]  That is teaching
[4634.36 --> 4636.38]  the word of God.
[4636.62 --> 4637.84]  I am so thankful
[4637.84 --> 4638.88]  for the youth leaders
[4638.88 --> 4639.44]  in this room,
[4639.70 --> 4640.74]  especially in the moments
[4640.74 --> 4641.80]  where it feels thankless
[4641.80 --> 4642.66]  and the students
[4642.66 --> 4643.94]  might smell a little bit.
[4644.32 --> 4645.06]  Even then,
[4645.44 --> 4646.58]  this is the prophetic ministry
[4646.58 --> 4647.80]  that you have been called into.
[4648.74 --> 4650.44]  But secondly,
[4650.76 --> 4651.84]  the prophetic ministry
[4651.84 --> 4653.38]  of Jesus also involves
[4653.38 --> 4655.16]  sharing the gospel.
[4656.14 --> 4657.38]  It involves speaking
[4657.38 --> 4658.42]  why you believe
[4658.42 --> 4659.40]  what you do about Jesus
[4659.40 --> 4660.20]  with classmates,
[4660.96 --> 4661.36]  coworkers,
[4662.08 --> 4663.32]  friends on the soccer field,
[4663.66 --> 4664.94]  friends on the volleyball court,
[4665.06 --> 4665.78]  and neighbors.
[4666.44 --> 4666.62]  Right?
[4666.88 --> 4667.66]  And this might be
[4667.66 --> 4668.58]  like every student
[4668.58 --> 4670.62]  and parents,
[4671.32 --> 4672.00]  greatest fear,
[4672.58 --> 4673.22]  evangelism,
[4673.36 --> 4674.14]  sharing the gospel.
[4674.78 --> 4675.86]  And let me just put it this way.
[4675.86 --> 4678.04]  The most easy way
[4678.04 --> 4679.02]  to do evangelism
[4679.02 --> 4680.74]  is to talk as you are
[4680.74 --> 4682.72]  about your ordinary life
[4682.72 --> 4683.82]  as someone who loves Jesus.
[4684.18 --> 4685.76]  You don't need to be a ninja about it.
[4686.24 --> 4686.86]  Like go in there,
[4686.96 --> 4688.04]  like chop someone with Jesus
[4688.04 --> 4688.84]  with this phrase.
[4689.02 --> 4689.78]  You just need to live
[4689.78 --> 4690.76]  your ordinary life
[4690.76 --> 4692.04]  and be willing to speak
[4692.04 --> 4692.56]  about Jesus
[4692.56 --> 4693.44]  as the questions
[4693.44 --> 4695.26]  and the conversations arise.
[4695.96 --> 4696.96]  And what I learned
[4696.96 --> 4698.46]  when I was a youth pastor
[4698.46 --> 4700.00]  is you don't need
[4700.00 --> 4700.80]  to go far away
[4700.80 --> 4701.56]  to find the people
[4701.56 --> 4701.96]  in your life
[4701.96 --> 4702.90]  who don't yet know Jesus
[4702.90 --> 4703.74]  or do not know
[4703.74 --> 4704.48]  the word of God.
[4704.64 --> 4705.28]  They're usually
[4705.28 --> 4705.94]  in your neighborhood.
[4706.30 --> 4707.26]  They're close by.
[4707.38 --> 4707.84]  It's a student
[4707.84 --> 4709.26]  who sits beside you in class
[4709.26 --> 4710.00]  or the person
[4710.00 --> 4710.92]  you're already friends with.
[4711.30 --> 4712.54]  Those are the people
[4712.54 --> 4714.64]  that Jesus himself says,
[4714.74 --> 4715.66]  you are my witnesses
[4715.66 --> 4717.04]  to share the living word
[4717.04 --> 4717.68]  of God to
[4717.68 --> 4719.28]  in your ordinary life.
[4719.72 --> 4720.66]  And whatever fears
[4720.66 --> 4721.62]  you have about that,
[4722.12 --> 4723.16]  bring to your heavenly father
[4723.16 --> 4723.64]  in prayer
[4723.64 --> 4724.66]  and know that Jesus,
[4724.84 --> 4725.30]  your king,
[4725.50 --> 4726.78]  is interceding for you
[4726.78 --> 4727.70]  to do that well.
[4727.70 --> 4730.38]  You and I are called
[4730.38 --> 4731.12]  to the ministry
[4731.12 --> 4733.24]  of being prophets,
[4733.96 --> 4735.34]  of speaking God's word.
[4735.68 --> 4736.34]  But secondly,
[4736.52 --> 4737.78]  you are also invited
[4737.78 --> 4739.52]  into the priestly ministry.
[4739.96 --> 4741.00]  And the priestly ministry,
[4741.14 --> 4742.10]  as we looked at last night,
[4742.28 --> 4743.08]  is that ministry
[4743.08 --> 4743.84]  of intercession.
[4744.48 --> 4745.26]  You are not called
[4745.26 --> 4746.34]  to do what Jesus does
[4746.34 --> 4747.14]  in the sense of giving
[4747.14 --> 4747.82]  a sacrifice
[4747.82 --> 4749.08]  for the sake of the world
[4749.08 --> 4749.82]  once and for all
[4749.82 --> 4750.52]  that's been done.
[4750.72 --> 4751.68]  But you are called
[4751.68 --> 4752.78]  to make your life
[4752.78 --> 4753.86]  a living sacrifice.
[4754.90 --> 4755.86]  And you are called
[4755.86 --> 4756.68]  to intercede
[4756.68 --> 4757.96]  for those around you.
[4759.46 --> 4760.78]  There are so many things,
[4761.62 --> 4762.76]  so many problems,
[4763.20 --> 4764.34]  so much brokenness
[4764.34 --> 4765.44]  that you cannot solve.
[4766.12 --> 4767.74]  But you can always pray.
[4768.88 --> 4770.16]  In my role as a pastor,
[4770.54 --> 4771.98]  I often feel overwhelmed
[4771.98 --> 4773.36]  by the needs around me.
[4773.80 --> 4774.96]  I feel incapable
[4774.96 --> 4775.56]  of solving
[4775.56 --> 4777.10]  even a small fraction
[4777.10 --> 4778.36]  of the challenges
[4778.36 --> 4779.20]  that come my way.
[4779.44 --> 4780.42]  And when that happens,
[4780.72 --> 4781.98]  I am increasingly saying,
[4782.08 --> 4782.52]  all right, Lord,
[4782.80 --> 4784.18]  this is what I can't do.
[4784.26 --> 4785.30]  I'm just Dave Groon,
[4785.30 --> 4786.34]  but I can pray
[4786.34 --> 4787.02]  for that couple.
[4787.82 --> 4789.18]  I can pray for that marriage.
[4789.32 --> 4790.10]  I can pray for that
[4790.10 --> 4790.80]  broken relationship.
[4790.92 --> 4792.00]  I can pray for the student
[4792.00 --> 4793.30]  who just got let go
[4793.30 --> 4794.04]  of this position.
[4794.30 --> 4795.04]  I can pray.
[4795.54 --> 4796.52]  I can intercede.
[4798.12 --> 4799.26]  And here's my hunch.
[4801.22 --> 4803.04]  God generally places
[4803.04 --> 4804.02]  on your heart
[4804.02 --> 4805.52]  the people
[4805.52 --> 4806.66]  and the issues
[4806.66 --> 4807.72]  and the places
[4807.72 --> 4809.42]  that you should intercede for.
[4810.08 --> 4811.00]  I'm always amazed
[4811.00 --> 4811.86]  when I talk to students
[4811.86 --> 4812.42]  and when I talk
[4812.42 --> 4813.02]  to young adults,
[4813.38 --> 4814.02]  when I ask them,
[4814.12 --> 4814.16]  like,
[4814.16 --> 4814.72]  what are the burdens
[4814.72 --> 4815.20]  of your life
[4815.20 --> 4816.16]  or who's on your heart?
[4816.24 --> 4816.36]  Like,
[4816.40 --> 4817.30]  God's already placing
[4817.30 --> 4818.02]  on your heart
[4818.02 --> 4819.46]  and has already
[4819.46 --> 4820.70]  in your relationship circle
[4820.70 --> 4822.22]  the people that he's inviting
[4822.22 --> 4823.40]  you to intercede for,
[4823.92 --> 4825.16]  to be the priest for.
[4825.54 --> 4826.38]  All you need to do
[4826.38 --> 4827.22]  is take those names
[4827.22 --> 4828.10]  and take those thoughts
[4828.10 --> 4829.54]  and bring that into prayer
[4829.54 --> 4830.80]  and allow God
[4830.80 --> 4832.32]  to do what only God can do
[4832.32 --> 4833.22]  in these broken,
[4833.48 --> 4834.50]  difficult relationships
[4834.50 --> 4835.50]  and situations.
[4836.16 --> 4837.12]  You were called
[4837.12 --> 4837.92]  into the ministry
[4837.92 --> 4838.92]  of the priesthood.
[4838.92 --> 4841.40]  And then thirdly,
[4842.88 --> 4843.28]  you're called
[4843.28 --> 4843.98]  to be kings
[4843.98 --> 4845.32]  and queens.
[4845.70 --> 4846.36]  Does that sound weird?
[4847.24 --> 4848.42]  Jesus invites you
[4848.42 --> 4849.16]  to share
[4849.16 --> 4850.74]  in his kingly ministry.
[4850.88 --> 4851.44]  And you're probably thinking,
[4851.60 --> 4851.66]  like,
[4851.74 --> 4853.18]  what in the world
[4853.18 --> 4854.26]  does that mean?
[4855.42 --> 4855.68]  You know,
[4855.74 --> 4856.62]  Jesus always,
[4856.72 --> 4857.06]  I should say,
[4857.10 --> 4857.66]  God always,
[4857.72 --> 4858.52]  from the very beginning,
[4858.62 --> 4859.44]  creating Adam and Eve,
[4859.66 --> 4861.56]  he wanted his humans
[4861.56 --> 4863.36]  to rule over this world well.
[4864.00 --> 4865.02]  And things went sideways
[4865.02 --> 4866.24]  when sin came into the world
[4866.24 --> 4867.16]  and we started getting greedy
[4867.16 --> 4867.84]  and selfish
[4867.84 --> 4868.90]  and we started ruling
[4868.90 --> 4869.60]  very terribly.
[4869.94 --> 4870.78]  And the work of Jesus,
[4871.32 --> 4872.64]  the sacrifice on the cross,
[4872.96 --> 4874.02]  enables us to rule
[4874.02 --> 4874.92]  over this world
[4874.92 --> 4876.78]  under Jesus' authority
[4876.78 --> 4878.66]  well and with justice
[4878.66 --> 4880.24]  and love and goodness.
[4881.20 --> 4883.06]  And every single one of us,
[4883.22 --> 4884.58]  and I do mean every one of us,
[4884.62 --> 4885.24]  even our youngest,
[4885.82 --> 4886.82]  there's something
[4886.82 --> 4888.30]  that God places
[4888.30 --> 4889.52]  under your authority.
[4890.64 --> 4890.82]  Right?
[4891.54 --> 4892.38]  There are people,
[4892.46 --> 4892.96]  if you're a parent,
[4893.04 --> 4893.48]  there's people
[4893.48 --> 4894.78]  God places under your authority.
[4894.98 --> 4895.48]  If you're a teacher,
[4895.60 --> 4896.08]  there are children
[4896.08 --> 4896.94]  under your authority.
[4897.16 --> 4897.90]  If you're a student,
[4898.80 --> 4899.80]  perhaps you are a leader
[4899.80 --> 4900.90]  on your basketball team.
[4901.52 --> 4902.70]  Perhaps you're an older sibling.
[4903.40 --> 4904.44]  Perhaps you have influence
[4904.44 --> 4905.12]  among your friends
[4905.12 --> 4906.20]  and they kind of look up to you.
[4906.22 --> 4907.60]  In all these spaces,
[4908.32 --> 4910.02]  God calls you to lead,
[4910.46 --> 4911.58]  to take on that sort of
[4911.58 --> 4912.70]  kingly authority
[4912.70 --> 4914.22]  and to love well
[4914.22 --> 4915.32]  with the authority you have,
[4915.38 --> 4917.06]  to lead well and generously
[4917.06 --> 4918.32]  and with justice
[4918.32 --> 4919.60]  in all the places
[4919.60 --> 4921.00]  you find yourself.
[4921.00 --> 4922.48]  You were called to share
[4922.48 --> 4924.92]  in Jesus' kingly ministry.
[4924.92 --> 4928.26]  There's a young guy
[4928.26 --> 4929.54]  I was discipling for a while.
[4930.28 --> 4931.14]  He's actually now
[4931.14 --> 4932.64]  in grad school.
[4933.76 --> 4934.86]  And as we were working out
[4934.86 --> 4935.84]  in his place,
[4935.88 --> 4936.12]  actually,
[4936.18 --> 4936.86]  where he works,
[4937.62 --> 4938.66]  he's studying to be a doctor,
[4938.74 --> 4939.36]  a medical doctor,
[4939.46 --> 4939.70]  and he,
[4939.96 --> 4940.56]  throughout his studies,
[4940.64 --> 4941.14]  is just finding
[4941.14 --> 4941.90]  some of the challenges
[4941.90 --> 4942.88]  that come with sort of
[4942.88 --> 4944.00]  being in the medical space,
[4944.28 --> 4944.84]  being a Christian
[4944.84 --> 4945.44]  in that sphere,
[4945.86 --> 4946.62]  and just thinking about
[4946.62 --> 4947.30]  what kind of authority
[4947.30 --> 4947.78]  does he have,
[4947.82 --> 4948.64]  what kind of influence
[4948.64 --> 4949.34]  does he have.
[4949.34 --> 4950.72]  And he shared with me
[4950.72 --> 4952.14]  one of the convictions he had.
[4952.24 --> 4952.88]  This actually comes
[4952.88 --> 4953.54]  from C.S. Lewis,
[4953.68 --> 4954.10]  and he said,
[4954.58 --> 4955.82]  as I think about my life
[4955.82 --> 4957.08]  and the sphere I'm in now,
[4957.62 --> 4958.40]  I think the way
[4958.40 --> 4959.40]  that I witness to Jesus
[4959.40 --> 4960.62]  is what's called
[4960.62 --> 4962.00]  the bright light
[4962.00 --> 4963.84]  of a life well lived.
[4964.42 --> 4965.26]  Have you ever heard that phrase?
[4965.96 --> 4966.98]  The bright light
[4966.98 --> 4968.64]  of a life well lived.
[4968.68 --> 4969.42]  And that is to say,
[4969.64 --> 4970.56]  the way you live
[4970.56 --> 4972.56]  in the ordinary places you are,
[4973.00 --> 4973.76]  if you are seeking
[4973.76 --> 4975.20]  to live under the authority
[4975.20 --> 4975.76]  of Jesus
[4975.76 --> 4977.38]  and take his word
[4977.38 --> 4978.68]  into practice in your life,
[4978.68 --> 4980.14]  there's a very good chance
[4980.14 --> 4981.02]  that that is going
[4981.02 --> 4982.58]  to speak volumes
[4982.58 --> 4983.88]  about the gospel.
[4985.18 --> 4986.00]  And it's my prayer
[4986.00 --> 4987.02]  that even this week
[4987.02 --> 4987.86]  and this month
[4987.86 --> 4989.00]  that you will have people
[4989.00 --> 4990.18]  who kind of look at you
[4990.18 --> 4990.70]  and they're like
[4990.70 --> 4991.50]  wondering about you
[4991.50 --> 4992.46]  and they just have this hunch,
[4992.56 --> 4993.88]  like this hunch that like,
[4993.96 --> 4994.90]  ah, there's something about you
[4994.90 --> 4995.80]  that's different, right?
[4996.02 --> 4997.28]  There's a way you treat people,
[4997.36 --> 4998.10]  the way you talk,
[4998.32 --> 4999.36]  the way you use your money
[4999.36 --> 5000.02]  that's just like,
[5000.28 --> 5001.80]  and the answer is Jesus, right?
[5002.12 --> 5003.12]  And you get to be the person
[5003.12 --> 5003.40]  who's like,
[5003.48 --> 5004.42]  yes, I'm a Christian.
[5004.88 --> 5006.02]  I'm part of the church
[5006.02 --> 5007.14]  and I believe that the way
[5007.14 --> 5007.54]  of Jesus
[5007.54 --> 5008.66]  is the way of life.
[5008.68 --> 5010.46]  You and I share
[5010.46 --> 5013.16]  in the kingly ministry of Jesus.
[5013.96 --> 5015.50]  And to each and every one of us,
[5015.54 --> 5015.96]  he says,
[5016.16 --> 5019.88]  you are my witnesses.
[5023.04 --> 5024.06]  I want to finish
[5024.06 --> 5024.96]  with the good news
[5024.96 --> 5026.16]  of the end of Acts 1.
[5027.98 --> 5029.46]  Let me read for us again
[5029.46 --> 5032.40]  what the two robed men in white
[5032.40 --> 5033.92]  say to these confused,
[5034.14 --> 5034.80]  perplexed,
[5034.80 --> 5036.46]  and perhaps discouraged disciples.
[5036.46 --> 5037.68]  They say,
[5037.68 --> 5038.82]  this Jesus
[5038.82 --> 5039.76]  who has been taken
[5039.76 --> 5040.90]  from you into heaven,
[5041.42 --> 5043.16]  he will come back
[5043.16 --> 5044.92]  in the same way
[5044.92 --> 5045.96]  you have seen him
[5045.96 --> 5047.38]  go into heaven.
[5049.88 --> 5051.02]  Jesus is coming
[5051.02 --> 5053.06]  in glory
[5053.06 --> 5054.42]  and power
[5054.42 --> 5055.32]  and justice
[5055.32 --> 5056.12]  and wisdom.
[5056.12 --> 5057.30]  and when he does,
[5057.54 --> 5058.64]  he is going to put to right
[5058.64 --> 5059.84]  everything that is wrong
[5059.84 --> 5060.56]  with this world,
[5060.86 --> 5061.74]  everything that is wrong
[5061.74 --> 5062.52]  with you and me,
[5062.64 --> 5063.86]  and he's going to establish
[5063.86 --> 5065.52]  a perfectly just,
[5066.08 --> 5067.36]  loving world.
[5068.94 --> 5070.06]  And there will come a day,
[5070.16 --> 5070.44]  I pray,
[5070.54 --> 5071.18]  where you and I
[5071.18 --> 5072.40]  see face to face
[5072.40 --> 5073.08]  Jesus,
[5073.24 --> 5074.24]  the great high priest,
[5074.66 --> 5074.96]  Jesus,
[5075.14 --> 5075.86]  the great prophet,
[5075.86 --> 5076.60]  and Jesus,
[5076.80 --> 5078.22]  the rightful king,
[5078.40 --> 5079.66]  and we worship at his feet
[5079.66 --> 5080.58]  because he has made
[5080.58 --> 5081.40]  all things new.
[5082.46 --> 5083.02]  And on that day,
[5083.06 --> 5083.40]  you're going to get
[5083.40 --> 5084.06]  a new body
[5084.06 --> 5085.68]  that is fully healthy,
[5085.84 --> 5087.52]  a body that will live forever
[5087.52 --> 5088.24]  in the same way
[5088.24 --> 5089.68]  that Jesus' current body does,
[5089.82 --> 5090.48]  and you will get
[5090.48 --> 5092.54]  to experience forever
[5092.54 --> 5094.66]  a world that is good
[5094.66 --> 5095.30]  and right
[5095.30 --> 5096.10]  and beautiful,
[5096.96 --> 5097.68]  stripped free
[5097.68 --> 5098.54]  of all the sin
[5098.54 --> 5099.16]  that corrupts
[5099.16 --> 5099.64]  and pollutes
[5099.64 --> 5100.76]  all the relationships
[5100.76 --> 5101.46]  we live in,
[5101.78 --> 5102.92]  all the lives we live,
[5103.26 --> 5103.80]  all the places
[5103.80 --> 5104.86]  we study and work,
[5104.86 --> 5106.16]  and it will be good
[5106.16 --> 5107.38]  and it will be well
[5107.38 --> 5108.50]  because Jesus,
[5108.68 --> 5109.16]  your king,
[5109.52 --> 5110.62]  is coming again.
[5111.64 --> 5112.42]  And until that day,
[5112.50 --> 5113.66]  he says to all of us,
[5114.18 --> 5117.64]  you are my witnesses.
[5120.64 --> 5121.86]  Let me lead us in prayer.
[5129.44 --> 5130.48]  Jesus, we thank you
[5130.48 --> 5131.50]  for sitting on the throne,
[5132.30 --> 5134.30]  for being above
[5134.30 --> 5135.30]  every authority,
[5136.38 --> 5137.16]  every government,
[5137.94 --> 5138.76]  every power,
[5139.26 --> 5140.44]  every spiritual force
[5140.44 --> 5141.28]  that we cannot see.
[5141.36 --> 5141.84]  We thank you
[5141.84 --> 5143.32]  that all those things
[5143.32 --> 5145.42]  are under your rule.
[5146.72 --> 5147.32]  And today,
[5147.44 --> 5148.14]  even our worship
[5148.14 --> 5149.16]  is a small act
[5149.16 --> 5149.60]  of saying,
[5149.78 --> 5151.10]  you are in control
[5151.10 --> 5152.04]  and we praise you.
[5153.00 --> 5153.90]  We ask that you
[5153.90 --> 5154.64]  give us eyes
[5154.64 --> 5156.20]  to see how our lives
[5156.20 --> 5157.72]  are under your control
[5157.72 --> 5158.98]  and we do not need to fear.
[5158.98 --> 5160.46]  that our cities
[5160.46 --> 5161.20]  and our country
[5161.20 --> 5162.28]  is under your authority
[5162.28 --> 5163.50]  and we do not need to fear.
[5163.50 --> 5164.70]  Our futures
[5164.70 --> 5166.48]  are under your authority
[5166.48 --> 5167.80]  and we do not need to fear.
[5169.36 --> 5170.28]  And our prayer,
[5170.44 --> 5170.52]  Lord,
[5170.58 --> 5171.72]  is that you would fill us
[5171.72 --> 5172.42]  with the power
[5172.42 --> 5173.26]  of your spirit
[5173.26 --> 5174.76]  so that we would
[5174.76 --> 5176.46]  in the most ordinary ways
[5176.46 --> 5177.88]  be witnesses
[5177.88 --> 5178.86]  to you,
[5179.02 --> 5179.80]  the rightful king
[5179.80 --> 5180.42]  of this world.
[5181.62 --> 5182.86]  Use our words,
[5184.10 --> 5185.16]  use our actions
[5185.16 --> 5186.58]  to point our friends
[5186.58 --> 5187.22]  and neighbors
[5187.22 --> 5188.08]  and coworkers
[5188.08 --> 5189.84]  to Jesus Christ,
[5190.00 --> 5190.58]  our Savior
[5190.58 --> 5192.48]  and our King.
[5193.24 --> 5194.22]  It is in his name
[5194.22 --> 5194.78]  we pray.
[5195.32 --> 5195.68]  Amen.
[5197.12 --> 5198.22]  Would you stand
[5198.22 --> 5199.30]  and join me again
[5199.30 --> 5199.76]  in worship?
[5199.76 --> 5199.92]  Amen.
[5215.16 --> 5216.30]  Amen.
[5216.30 --> 5216.50]  Amen.
[5241.30 --> 5242.14]  Amen.
[5242.14 --> 5254.14]  You know me, all my secrets you see. You know me more.
[5254.14 --> 5269.14]  You know me, all my vulnerability. But you know me more.
[5269.14 --> 5271.14]  Oh.
[5284.14 --> 5298.14]  You see me, all the truth you see. You see me, Lord.
[5298.14 --> 5312.14]  You see me fighting my humanity. You see me torn.
[5312.14 --> 5336.14]  You see me, Lord. You were, you are the king of everything.
[5336.14 --> 5354.14]  You are the anthem over me. And I'm feeling your heart beat. It reverberates in me.
[5354.14 --> 5366.14]  You hear me, every cry that I believe. You hear me, Lord.
[5366.14 --> 5393.14]  You hear me, every cry that I believe. You hear me, Lord. You hear me, desperate for your sympathy. You hear me more.
[5393.14 --> 5416.14]  You hear me, every cry that I believe. You hear me, Lord. You see me, Lord. You see me, Lord. You are the king of everything.
[5416.14 --> 5444.14]  You hear me, every call of me. And I'm feeling your heart beat. It reverberates in me. In me. In me.
[5444.14 --> 5469.14]  Fill these lungs with your glory and let them sing, you are King.
[5469.14 --> 5483.14]  Fill these lungs with your glory and let them sing, you are King.
[5483.14 --> 5499.14]  Fill these lungs with your glory and let them sing, you are King.
[5499.14 --> 5518.14]  You are, you are the King of everything.
[5518.14 --> 5530.14]  And you are still the end of all of me, feeling your heart beat.
[5530.14 --> 5542.14]  And reverberate new hope, the King of everything.
[5542.14 --> 5554.14]  The river over us, the river over us.
[5554.14 --> 5566.14]  So fill these lungs.
[5566.14 --> 5570.14]  I give it.
[5570.14 --> 5574.14]  That's a rough transition.
[5574.14 --> 5576.14]  We still love you buddy.
[5576.14 --> 5583.14]  In just a minute, I'm going to invite Pastor Dave Ford.
[5583.14 --> 5588.14]  He's going to lead us in God's blessing for us as we leave this place.
[5588.14 --> 5590.14]  And then we're going to sing one more song.
[5590.14 --> 5597.14]  And youth who are here for Reactivate, that will conclude Reactivate 2024.
[5597.14 --> 5604.14]  And those of you who are from Emmanuel, that will conclude the church service on September the 8th, 2024.
[5604.14 --> 5607.14]  You're all invited to head into the foyer.
[5607.14 --> 5609.14]  I believe there's going to be coffee.
[5609.14 --> 5611.14]  We'll have some fellowship together there for sure.
[5611.14 --> 5616.14]  Youth, make sure as Curtis mentioned at the beginning to touch base with your leaders.
[5616.14 --> 5621.14]  If your parents are here to take you home or if you're heading home on a bus, grab some lunches.
[5621.14 --> 5623.14]  You can do your thing that way as well.
[5623.14 --> 5628.14]  Before I turn the mic over, I did want to thank two more people.
[5628.14 --> 5630.14]  Well, really five more people.
[5630.14 --> 5636.14]  Pastor Dave, thank you so much for coming here this weekend and leading us in God's word.
[5640.14 --> 5648.14]  Just an incredible job leading us in who Jesus is and how he relates to us and what his calling is on our life.
[5648.14 --> 5649.14]  So I thank you so much.
[5649.14 --> 5652.14]  And I thank you to Luke and the Arctic and the band as well.
[5652.14 --> 5657.14]  They've come back three years in a row to lead us in worship this conference once again.
[5657.14 --> 5661.14]  And so let's give them a round of applause as thanks as well.
[5667.14 --> 5669.14]  Alright, I'd like to invite Pastor Dave forward right now.
[5669.14 --> 5671.14]  He's going to lead us in God's blessing.
[5671.14 --> 5676.14]  Alright, as this has been tradition throughout reactivate, I want to ask the very obvious question.
[5676.14 --> 5678.14]  Do you want to receive God's blessing?
[5678.14 --> 5679.14]  Yes!
[5679.14 --> 5680.14]  Amen!
[5680.14 --> 5681.14]  Let's hold our hands out.
[5681.14 --> 5685.14]  I'm going to read words of sending from the end of Matthew's Gospel and then I will give us God's blessing.
[5685.14 --> 5688.14]  The disciples are with Jesus.
[5688.14 --> 5690.14]  This is Matthew's account of Jesus.
[5690.14 --> 5694.14]  Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
[5694.14 --> 5697.14]  When they saw him, they worshipped him, but some doubted.
[5697.14 --> 5699.14]  And then Jesus came to them and said,
[5699.14 --> 5705.14]  All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[5705.14 --> 5709.14]  Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations,
[5709.14 --> 5713.14]  baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,
[5713.14 --> 5718.14]  and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you.
[5718.14 --> 5723.14]  And surely I am with you always to the very end of the age.
[5723.14 --> 5725.14]  So go in the love of the Father.
[5725.14 --> 5729.14]  Go in the grace of Jesus Christ that has come to you through the cross.
[5729.14 --> 5733.14]  And go in the empowering presence of the Holy Spirit.
[5733.14 --> 5735.14]  And together we say, Amen.
[5735.14 --> 5747.14]  Okay, we're going to do one more song.
[5747.14 --> 5751.14]  There's something really special about this last song actually.
[5751.14 --> 5755.14]  Back in the 90s.
[5755.14 --> 5759.14]  Back in the 90s.
[5759.14 --> 5761.14]  There was a church.
[5761.14 --> 5764.14]  I believe it's still here, but I don't know.
[5764.14 --> 5769.14]  It's actually just probably about five minutes that way.
[5769.14 --> 5772.14]  Not even, maybe three minutes that way.
[5772.14 --> 5779.14]  And this church had amazing songs come out of it.
[5779.14 --> 5786.14]  And it was just kind of this wild thing that this tiny little church in Langley
[5786.14 --> 5791.14]  had these songs that literally were sung in churches all over the world.
[5791.14 --> 5793.14]  It was crazy.
[5793.14 --> 5796.14]  And these are, this is one of the songs from that time.
[5796.14 --> 5801.14]  And I'm, I was, I was kind of bummed because I was going to bring out the guy who wrote it.
[5801.14 --> 5804.14]  He's a friend, but he's actually leading worship at my church.
[5804.14 --> 5806.14]  So I wasn't able to bring him out.
[5806.14 --> 5811.14]  But, um, he, he's, he's a really special guy.
[5811.14 --> 5820.14]  And I just thought it would be kind of fun to sing a song that is actually from the soil that was here.
[5820.14 --> 5824.14]  You know, a little farther away, but from the same ground.
[5824.14 --> 5827.14]  So if you know it, we would love for you to sing it.
[5827.14 --> 5831.14]  If you don't know it, this is a, this is a little piece of history for you.
[5831.14 --> 5856.14]  I'm going to sing it for you.
[5856.14 --> 5857.14]  I'm going to sing it for you.
[5857.14 --> 5858.14]  I'm going to sing it for you.
[5858.14 --> 5859.14]  I'm going to sing it for you.
[5859.14 --> 5864.14]  I'm going to sing it for you.
[5864.14 --> 5869.14]  I'm going to sing it for you.
[5869.14 --> 5872.14]  I'm going to sing it for you.
[5872.14 --> 5885.14]  The Judith audience DP the evening.
[5885.14 --> 5887.16]  tear it up trial are there.
[5887.16 --> 5897.14]  In the secret, in the quiet hour away, only for you, because I want to know you more.
[5897.14 --> 5906.50]  I want to know you
[5906.50 --> 5913.28]  I want to hear your voice
[5913.28 --> 5918.26]  I want to know you
[5918.26 --> 5929.48]  And I want to touch you
[5929.48 --> 5936.28]  I want to see your face
[5936.28 --> 5941.34]  I want to know you
[5941.34 --> 5971.32]  I want to know you
[5971.34 --> 5978.34]  In reaching for the highest goal
[5978.34 --> 5993.34]  I receive the prize
[5993.34 --> 5995.34]  Pressing onward
[5995.34 --> 6000.34]  Pressing every hindrance aside
[6000.34 --> 6004.34]  Out of my way
[6004.34 --> 6009.34]  I want to know you
[6009.34 --> 6011.34]  I want to know you
[6011.34 --> 6020.34]  I want to know you
[6020.34 --> 6027.34]  I want to hear your voice
[6027.34 --> 6033.34]  I want to know you more
[6033.34 --> 6037.34]  More, more
[6037.34 --> 6044.34]  I want to touch you
[6044.34 --> 6050.34]  I want to see your face
[6050.34 --> 6057.34]  I want to know you
[6057.34 --> 6062.34]  I want to know you
[6062.34 --> 6067.34]  I want to know you
[6067.34 --> 6072.34]  I want to hear your voice
[6072.34 --> 6077.34]  I want to know you
[6077.34 --> 6084.34]  I want to know you
[6084.34 --> 6087.34]  I want to know you
[6087.34 --> 6091.34]  I want to touch you
[6091.34 --> 6096.84]  I want to see your desi
[6096.84 --> 6105.96]  I want to know you more
[6105.96 --> 6108.82]  I want to know you more
[6108.82 --> 6114.56]  I want to know you more
[6114.56 --> 6120.04]  I want to know you more
[6120.04 --> 6124.40]  I want to love you.
[6136.68 --> 6140.68]  So Lord, may he bless you and keep you.
[6142.32 --> 6147.60]  May he shine his face upon you and grant you peace.
[6150.04 --> 6154.34]  May you get to know him more.
[6155.38 --> 6156.82]  May you get to experience him.
[6156.82 --> 6163.30]  And every day, may he make himself known to you in most amazing ways.
[6177.18 --> 6177.90]  Amen.
[6177.90 --> 6180.90]  That concludes Reactivate.
[6184.90 --> 6189.14]  Have a great school year.
[6189.14 --> 6215.20]  Running
[6215.20 --> 6219.28]  Have you come to the end of yourself?
[6220.58 --> 6224.40]  Do you thirst for a drink from the well?
[6225.24 --> 6227.32]  Jesus is calling.
[6229.82 --> 6233.64]  Oh, come to the altar.
