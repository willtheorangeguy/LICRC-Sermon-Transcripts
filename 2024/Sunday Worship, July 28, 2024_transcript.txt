[0.92 --> 8.36]  Welcome to worship. A special welcome if you are a guest with us in visiting this summer.
[8.54 --> 15.74]  It's so good to gather together and to worship our good God and to praise the name of Jesus.
[15.92 --> 21.54]  My name is Chris. I'm one of the pastors here, and it's my privilege, along with these others you see on stage,
[21.68 --> 25.14]  to lead in our shared worship together this morning.
[25.14 --> 31.58]  So, there's only one announcement that I am aware of before our service,
[31.74 --> 36.62]  and that is just a reminder for you regular members and regular worshipers here.
[37.68 --> 40.48]  Reactivate Youth Conference is coming up in September,
[40.48 --> 44.58]  and we're looking for volunteers to help staff out that weekend event,
[44.62 --> 50.28]  where we've got teenagers from Christian Reformed churches all over B.C. who come down here
[50.28 --> 56.26]  and hang out for the weekend, worship God, and learn about what it means to be a disciple of Jesus.
[56.48 --> 61.58]  And so, our church really steps up in hosting that and requires volunteers.
[61.82 --> 66.92]  And so, there's a sign-up sheet for that that's in the e-bulletin that goes out every weekend.
[67.16 --> 71.02]  And so, if you aren't signed up for the e-bulletin, you can talk to the office,
[71.22 --> 75.24]  and they'll get you signed up, and then you can follow through the sign-up sheet there.
[75.24 --> 76.88]  I believe that's it.
[77.64 --> 79.80]  And so, unless someone tells me otherwise,
[80.72 --> 84.96]  let's stand together, be welcomed into God's presence.
[87.22 --> 90.78]  As we gather, we do so in the presence of God,
[90.88 --> 93.82]  who is here in the power of the Holy Spirit.
[93.92 --> 97.24]  And we mark that presence, we receive that presence,
[97.42 --> 102.26]  and we stand in that presence by receiving the greeting of God.
[102.26 --> 106.70]  And then we make that presence known by extending that greeting to each other.
[106.96 --> 109.34]  And so, after I greet you in the Lord's name,
[109.40 --> 113.64]  I encourage you to turn to those around you and to greet them in the name of Jesus.
[113.82 --> 117.00]  You can say, peace of Christ be with you, or the Lord be with you,
[117.06 --> 119.04]  or you can just say, hey, what's up?
[119.68 --> 120.86]  However you want to do that.
[121.60 --> 123.44]  Receive the greeting of our good God.
[123.44 --> 128.10]  Grace, mercy, and peace to you,
[128.54 --> 129.64]  from God our Father,
[129.98 --> 132.82]  from the Lord Jesus Christ, His Son, and our Savior,
[133.38 --> 135.98]  through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[136.88 --> 137.26]  Amen.
[137.86 --> 138.92]  Greet one another in Christ.
[153.44 --> 170.72]  This call to worship comes from Psalm 96.
[171.46 --> 173.32]  Sing to the Lord a new song.
[173.70 --> 175.46]  Sing to the Lord all the earth.
[175.86 --> 177.78]  Sing to the Lord, praise His name.
[178.16 --> 180.50]  Proclaim His salvation day after day.
[180.50 --> 183.38]  Declare His glory among the nations.
[183.80 --> 186.50]  His marvelous deeds among all peoples.
[186.50 --> 187.84] chant by Bible
[196.84 --> 198.62] neaiella
[198.62 --> 212.62]  Oh God, I take heaven, how a redeemer I lay
[212.62 --> 219.62]  I've been led to glory, I've been led to love you, God
[219.62 --> 230.62]  Oh God, I remember the rocks high at your feet
[230.62 --> 237.62]  I will let your glory come and let your glory fall
[237.62 --> 248.62]  I will sing, sing a new song, I will sing, sing a new song
[248.62 --> 256.62]  I will sing, sing a new song to the Lord
[256.62 --> 261.62]  Let your kingdom come and let your will be done
[261.62 --> 265.62]  For earth as it is in heaven
[265.62 --> 270.62]  Every hour will gain, just the hour will gain
[270.62 --> 275.62]  For earth as it is in heaven
[275.62 --> 292.62]  Forgive us, you every morning, mercy is daily bread
[292.62 --> 300.62]  In the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus we pray
[300.62 --> 310.62]  And lead us not to temptation, but deliver us with your hand
[310.62 --> 318.62]  For in the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus we pray
[318.62 --> 326.62]  I will sing, sing a new song
[326.62 --> 335.62]  I will sing, sing a new song to the Lord
[335.62 --> 339.62]  Let your kingdom come and let your will be done
[339.62 --> 343.62]  On earth as it is in heaven
[343.62 --> 347.62]  Every heart proclaim the mercy of your name
[347.62 --> 352.62]  On earth as it is in heaven
[352.62 --> 357.62]  For the kingdom is yours and the power is yours
[357.62 --> 362.62]  And the glory forever, amen
[362.62 --> 372.62]  For the kingdom is yours and the power is yours
[372.62 --> 382.62]  And the glory forever, amen
[382.62 --> 384.62]  And the kingdom is yours and the power is yours
[384.62 --> 386.62]  And the glory forever, amen
[386.62 --> 390.62]  Let your kingdom come, let your will be done
[390.62 --> 396.62]  On earth as it is in heaven
[396.62 --> 400.62]  Every heart proclaim the mercy of your name
[400.62 --> 406.62]  On earth as it is in heaven
[406.62 --> 408.62]  In life
[408.62 --> 414.62]  Every heart proclaim the mercy of your name
[414.62 --> 419.62]  frustrate, amen
[419.62 --> 422.12]  On earth as it is Warren
[422.62 --> 423.62]  There many others
[423.62 --> 424.62]  For scène as it is written
[424.62 --> 429.62]  For a kingdom, retreat
[429.62 --> 430.62]  Even with half Thin
[430.62 --> 431.62]  Amen
[431.62 --> 433.62]  Lord
[433.62 --> 435.62]  Amen
[435.62 --> 456.20]  Blessing and honor, glory and power, be unto the ancient of days.
[456.20 --> 466.02]  All of every nation, all of creation, now before the ancient of days.
[467.22 --> 472.20]  Every town in heaven and earth shall declare your glory.
[472.46 --> 480.28]  Every shall mount your throne, in worship you will be exalted, O God.
[480.28 --> 488.14]  And your kingdom shall not come to the end, O ancient of days.
[491.78 --> 500.60]  Blessing and honor, glory and power, be unto the ancient of days.
[500.60 --> 510.10]  All of every nation, all of creation, now before the ancient of days.
[511.10 --> 516.40]  Every town in heaven and earth shall declare your glory.
[516.60 --> 524.46]  Every year shall mount your throne, in worship you will be exalted, O God.
[524.46 --> 532.16]  And your kingdom shall not pass away, O ancient of days.
[534.96 --> 544.46]  Your kingdom shall reign over all the earth, sing unto the ancient of days.
[544.46 --> 553.96]  For none can compare to your master's throne, sing unto the ancient of days.
[554.96 --> 560.60]  All of every town in heaven and earth shall declare your glory.
[560.60 --> 568.40]  Every year shall mount your throne, in worship you will be exalted, O God.
[568.40 --> 576.00]  And your kingdom shall not pass away, O ancient of days.
[581.90 --> 592.32]  Our next song that we will be singing has the lyrics,
[593.00 --> 595.74]  I will bring praise, I will bring praise.
[595.74 --> 600.22]  No weapon that's formed me against me shall remain.
[600.46 --> 606.02]  I will rejoice, I will declare, God is my victory and he is here.
[607.10 --> 612.84]  It struck me that this is a chorus in a song with a title, Desert Song.
[613.66 --> 616.48]  We all go through our moments in the desert.
[617.32 --> 620.04]  Some of you may be experiencing this right now.
[620.04 --> 625.24]  It may be sin that so easily entangles, like it says in Hebrews.
[625.76 --> 629.92]  Or perhaps it's pain or sorrow or hurt.
[630.84 --> 635.06]  In all these moments, though, we are called to declare praise.
[636.00 --> 643.24]  It may be in those times of praise during the desert that someone is encouraged in their faith because of how we are responding.
[643.24 --> 648.60]  So hold on to Jesus, no matter your circumstance.
[650.00 --> 654.88]  Let's take a few moments to focus our hearts on Jesus now in silent prayer,
[655.46 --> 659.26]  asking him for the strength to praise in all circumstances.
[659.26 --> 660.26]  Amen.
[660.38 --> 664.78]  Amen.
[669.94 --> 670.76]  Amen.
[677.76 --> 679.70]  Amen.
[679.70 --> 681.20]  Amen.
[681.20 --> 682.28]  Amen.
[682.70 --> 684.44]  Amen.
[684.44 --> 685.48]  Amen.
[685.48 --> 687.40]  Amen.
[687.40 --> 687.76]  Amen.
[688.14 --> 688.74]  Amen.
[688.74 --> 703.94]  This is my prayer in the desert
[703.94 --> 709.34]  When all that's within me feels dry
[709.34 --> 715.92]  This is my prayer in my hunger and need
[715.92 --> 720.18]  My God is the God who provides
[720.18 --> 725.34]  This is my prayer in the fire
[725.34 --> 731.12]  In weakness or trial or pain
[731.12 --> 736.82]  There is a breakthrough for work and go
[736.82 --> 740.80]  So refine me, Lord, through the flame
[740.80 --> 746.14]  I will bring praise, I will bring praise
[746.14 --> 750.80]  No weapon formed against me shall remain
[750.80 --> 755.64]  I will rejoice, I will declare
[755.64 --> 760.80]  God is my victory and He is here
[760.80 --> 774.06]  This is my prayer in the battle
[774.06 --> 778.74]  When triumph is still on its way
[778.74 --> 785.06]  I am a conqueror and poor and will rise
[785.06 --> 789.10]  So firm on His promise I'll stand
[789.10 --> 794.24]  I will bring praise, I will bring praise
[794.24 --> 799.06]  No weapon formed against me shall remain
[799.06 --> 803.72]  I will rejoice, I will declare
[803.72 --> 810.06]  God is my victory and He is me
[810.06 --> 822.98]  All of my life, in every season
[822.98 --> 829.52]  You are still God, I have a reason to sing
[829.52 --> 836.52]  I have a reason to sing
[836.52 --> 838.52]  I have a reason to sing
[838.52 --> 843.52]  All of my life, in every season
[843.52 --> 849.52]  You are still God, I have a reason to sing
[849.52 --> 862.84]  I have a reason to sing
[862.84 --> 864.48]  I have a reason to sing
[864.52 --> 866.52]  I have a reason to sing
[866.52 --> 868.56]  I have a reason to sing
[868.56 --> 870.56]  to sing
[871.36 --> 878.56]  i have a reason to worship
[878.88 --> 882.56]  all of my life
[886.16 --> 890.56]  i have a reason to sing
[890.96 --> 896.56]  i have a reason to worship
[896.56 --> 900.56]  i will bring praise
[900.56 --> 902.56]  i will bring praise
[902.56 --> 906.56]  no weapon fought against me shall remain
[906.56 --> 908.56]  i will rejoice
[908.56 --> 910.56]  i will declare
[910.56 --> 912.56]  god is my victory
[912.56 --> 916.56]  and he is here
[916.56 --> 930.56]  this is my prayer in the harvest
[930.56 --> 932.56]  favor and providence
[932.56 --> 934.56]  flow
[934.56 --> 936.56]  i know
[936.56 --> 938.56]  i feel to be
[938.56 --> 940.56]  empty again
[940.56 --> 942.56]  the seed i've received
[942.56 --> 952.56]  i will sow
[952.56 --> 956.56]  please stand as we hear the words of viewers
[956.56 --> 966.56]  can
[966.56 --> 968.56]  we
[968.56 --> 974.56]  day
[974.56 --> 976.56]  night
[976.56 --> 981.10]  It helps if you turn it on.
[984.64 --> 989.64]  Hebrews 12, verse 1 to 3, for assurance.
[990.46 --> 991.00]  It says,
[991.00 --> 995.10]  Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses,
[995.84 --> 1000.78]  let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles,
[1000.78 --> 1007.48]  and let us run with perseverance the race marked before us,
[1008.08 --> 1011.52]  fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith.
[1012.12 --> 1015.44]  For the joy set before him, he endured the cross,
[1016.20 --> 1021.52]  scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
[1022.10 --> 1025.40]  Consider him who endured such opposition from sinners,
[1025.82 --> 1028.56]  so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.
[1030.78 --> 1060.38]  Lord, let us pray.
[1060.78 --> 1065.10]  I reach in the name
[1065.10 --> 1066.96]  With love and grace
[1066.96 --> 1069.24]  And God is free
[1069.24 --> 1071.94]  On the top of the Lord
[1071.94 --> 1073.78]  All I need
[1073.78 --> 1077.34]  Our God is the Lion
[1077.34 --> 1080.08]  The Lion of the Lord
[1080.08 --> 1082.58]  He warred the power
[1082.58 --> 1085.14]  With mighty power
[1085.14 --> 1088.14]  Every love will come
[1088.14 --> 1089.98]  Before Him
[1089.98 --> 1093.36]  The Lord is the Lion
[1093.36 --> 1095.38]  The Lion of the Lord
[1095.38 --> 1098.92]  For the sins of the Lord
[1098.92 --> 1101.66]  His blood breaks the chain
[1101.66 --> 1104.30]  Every day we bow
[1104.30 --> 1107.08]  For the Lion of the Lord
[1107.08 --> 1109.76]  Every day we bow
[1109.76 --> 1111.68]  Before Him
[1111.68 --> 1112.18]  Ha ha h…
[1112.28 --> 1114.14]  The Lion of the Lord
[1114.14 --> 1115.14]  Amen.
[1144.14 --> 1146.14]  Amen.
[1174.14 --> 1176.14]  Amen.
[1193.60 --> 1198.12]  Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[1198.12 --> 1228.10]  Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[1228.12 --> 1232.12]  Who can stop the Lord Almighty?

[1249.12 --> 1251.12]  Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[1251.12 --> 1253.12]  Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[1253.12 --> 1261.70]  Who can tr
[1262.12 --> 1266.12]  Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[1266.12 --> 1266.60]  Amen.

[1542.60 --> 1544.60]  Thank you.
[1544.60 --> 1548.78]  And the angels stood in awe
[1548.78 --> 1551.60]  For the souls of all who come
[1552.12 --> 1555.76]  To the Father of His soul
[1555.76 --> 1558.60]  When the curse of Christ was born
[1559.16 --> 1562.88]  And the Spirit lit the flame
[1562.88 --> 1565.60]  Does His gospel truth of all
[1566.40 --> 1569.96]  Who shall not heal and fail of faith
[1569.96 --> 1573.46]  By His blood and His name
[1573.46 --> 1576.96]  In His freedom I am free
[1576.96 --> 1580.50]  For the love of Jesus Christ
[1580.50 --> 1584.82]  Good and perfect in me
[1584.82 --> 1593.56]  Praise the Father
[1593.56 --> 1596.90]  Praise the Son
[1596.90 --> 1600.90]  Praise the Spirit
[1600.90 --> 1604.40]  Three in one
[1604.40 --> 1607.94]  God of glory
[1607.94 --> 1608.94]  Spread His terror
[1608.94 --> 1611.48]  For the love I am free
[1611.82 --> 1613.52]  Pharaoh
[1613.52 --> 1632.36]  Praise the Father, praise the Son, praise the Spirit, three in one.
[1632.36 --> 1648.74]  God of glory, majesty, praise forever to the King of Peace.
[1662.36 --> 1674.18]  All right. Can I have kids who are aged three to kindergarten? Is that right?
[1675.82 --> 1682.46]  Sure, why not? Maybe even older. Come on up to the front. We're going to pray together,
[1682.76 --> 1689.68]  and then we're going to do the kids' blessing, and those of you whose parents know and have given
[1689.68 --> 1694.72]  you permission may head to the back for a special children's worship time together.
[1696.14 --> 1700.68]  You guys ready? You excited? Can we pray together? Let's pray for a minute.
[1701.90 --> 1709.00]  Lord Jesus, we thank you for the truth that out of the mouths of children and infants you have
[1709.00 --> 1715.24]  ordained praise. We thank you for these little ones among us, and we pray a blessing on them as they
[1715.24 --> 1722.58]  go to learn about you. Father God, show them your love. In Jesus' name, amen.
[1723.84 --> 1727.22]  All right, you guys stand up together, and everybody else can stand as well.
[1728.58 --> 1733.88]  I'm going to invite you, congregation, to hold your hands up, and then after the kids say,
[1733.96 --> 1738.30]  the Lord be with you, you're going to respond by saying, and also with you. Ready, guys? Together.
[1738.30 --> 1743.30]  The Lord be with you. Amen.
[1745.24 --> 1768.60]  Good morning. My name is Ken. I'm an elder here at Emanuel Church, and this morning I have the
[1768.60 --> 1774.22]  privilege of leading us as a congregation together to our Lord in prayer. So let's bow our heads and
[1774.22 --> 1781.38]  our hearts together, and let's pray to our God. Lord of all creation, we come to you on this
[1781.38 --> 1787.72]  beautiful sunny Sunday morning, joyfully singing your praises along with your creation. The heavens
[1787.72 --> 1794.24]  declare the glory of God. The floods lift up their voice. The rivers clap their hands. The mountains
[1794.24 --> 1799.96]  praise the Lord. We thank you, God, for the beauty all around us and the testimony it is to your amazing
[1799.96 --> 1805.66]  power and love. That as God of the universe, you are mindful of each of us, and we're willing to
[1805.66 --> 1812.16]  sacrifice your Son to save us from our sins. But amid the shouting and rejoicing of the heavens and the
[1812.16 --> 1818.00]  earth, we can hear the sound of creation's groans too, Lord. There's a lot of pain and strife in our
[1818.00 --> 1824.58]  world today. Help us remember that present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be
[1824.58 --> 1830.62]  revealed in us. Lord, we pray for the many people who are presently living in a time and place of war
[1830.62 --> 1837.02]  and conflict. We think of Israel and Palestine, Russia and Ukraine, but also the dozens of other
[1837.02 --> 1843.86]  armed conflicts presently ongoing that we can so easily forget. Help us not take the peace we live in
[1843.86 --> 1851.16]  for granted, but help us proclaim the peace of God that surpasses all understanding. Lord, we pray for the
[1851.16 --> 1857.64]  many people affected by wildfires this season. We see fires in California, Alberta, and here in BC with
[1857.64 --> 1863.94]  devastating property damage, destroyed communities, and displaced people. Give strength to those who are
[1863.94 --> 1870.50]  fighting the fires and to those who are dealing with the aftermath of them. Lord, we pray for healing for
[1870.50 --> 1875.66]  those in our congregation who have various ailments and health concerns at this time. Lord, you heal the
[1875.66 --> 1884.00]  brokenhearted and bind up our wounds. We lift up Imo and Benita as Imo's open heart surgery has been pushed
[1884.00 --> 1890.02]  out to later in August. Lord, we ask that you allow the surgery to take place and that it will be successful.
[1891.40 --> 1897.74]  Lord, we praise you with Clem as he had a successful and long-awaited knee surgery and is now getting back on
[1897.74 --> 1905.54]  his feet, feeling relief from a long ongoing pain. Lord, we pray for continued healing for Everly as she has an
[1905.54 --> 1911.02]  MRI to ensure that everything is clear. And Lord, we pray for your nearness to this young family.
[1912.36 --> 1918.36]  Lord, we also pray for those who quietly struggle with physical and mental health challenges and any
[1918.36 --> 1924.86]  other struggles and difficulties at this time. Lord, help us to know that we are not alone, but you are
[1924.86 --> 1932.56]  near to us always, and help us to turn to you in our times of struggle. God, as we're in the summer season
[1932.56 --> 1939.66]  of vacations and travel, we ask for safety and your protection for each one of us. Help us find times
[1939.66 --> 1947.76]  of refreshing and reflection on your love and grace, and help us still our hearts and open your word
[1947.76 --> 1954.36]  and hear you speak to us regularly. And Lord, today in the service, as we open your word this morning,
[1954.48 --> 1960.30]  we ask for your blessing on Pastor Chris as he brings us your message. Open our hearts and ears to hear
[1960.30 --> 1967.54]  your will for our lives today. And as we go out from this place to wherever you lead us. Lord, we ask all these
[1967.54 --> 1972.76]  things in your blessed name and in the grace of our Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1972.76 --> 1972.84]  Amen.
[1987.90 --> 1998.02]  This morning we're going to read from Acts 4. I'm going to read before we begin the first 22 verses
[1998.02 --> 2005.22]  in that story for us, and then we'll spend some time looking at that. The first time through,
[2005.34 --> 2010.42]  you'll see it on the screen, but I encourage you, as always, to either have a Bible you brought from
[2010.42 --> 2015.42]  home or one on your phone or device, or if you would like, you can grab one from the back there,
[2015.62 --> 2021.66]  turn that to Acts 4 and keep that open, because we will be referring back to that text pretty regularly
[2021.66 --> 2030.68]  throughout our time together. Additionally, this summer, I have a special call out to the kids,
[2030.76 --> 2035.60]  especially the kids who normally go to our children's worship time during the regular school
[2035.60 --> 2042.06]  year. The clipboards at the back, actually, you can thank Maria from the office for this,
[2042.46 --> 2046.84]  have on them now a piece of paper that is just left blank and says,
[2046.84 --> 2051.58]  a picture for Pastor Chris based on the sermon. So, I'm collecting your pictures this summer,
[2052.22 --> 2057.72]  and I'm going to make a little book of them all. And so, if you draw a picture or hear something that
[2057.72 --> 2063.04]  I say and sparks an idea or an image or something, I encourage you to just draw that out, and then if
[2063.04 --> 2067.52]  you're willing, let me have that after the service. Or if you want to keep it, I'll make a copy of it,
[2067.56 --> 2073.14]  and you can keep the original. But that would be great for me and for tracking what we hear and
[2073.14 --> 2081.00]  receive from God as we gather around His Word. With that in mind, let's read together from Acts 4.
[2086.44 --> 2096.36]  A little bit of context. Peter and John were walking near the temple, and there was a man,
[2096.36 --> 2103.92]  we are told in Acts 3, who was lame from birth. That is, he wasn't able to walk. His entire life,
[2104.10 --> 2108.86]  he wasn't able to walk. And at the very end of the chapter, we're going to read verse 22,
[2109.40 --> 2118.52]  we're told that he's 40 years old, this man. And so, for 40 years, he had been lame and unable to walk,
[2118.62 --> 2125.40]  and for most of his adult years, probably, friends of his or family members of his carded him to
[2125.40 --> 2130.78]  one of the temple gates called Beautiful, and he would sit there and beg, asking for money.
[2131.62 --> 2136.28]  Peter and John walk by, and hear this man begging, and Peter turns to him and says,
[2136.40 --> 2141.74]  silver and gold I do not have, but what I have I will give in the name of Jesus Christ. Stand up and
[2141.74 --> 2147.58]  walk. And immediately, we're told, he gets up, he walks, and he goes walking and leaping and praising
[2147.58 --> 2151.94]  God. If you grew up in the 80s or 90s, you're probably singing the song in your head right now.
[2151.94 --> 2158.34]  And he went out, and Peter and John, now, in the text that we are about to read,
[2159.02 --> 2166.22]  are called in front of the leading officials and the temple officials, asking them, challenging them,
[2166.56 --> 2171.12]  by what power and authority do they do these things? So that's where we are in the story.
[2171.12 --> 2173.10]  Chapter 4.
[2174.20 --> 2179.86]  The priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to Peter and John while
[2179.86 --> 2185.22]  they were speaking to the people. They were greatly disturbed because the apostles were teaching the
[2185.22 --> 2191.60]  people, proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead. They seized Peter and John, and because it
[2191.60 --> 2197.26]  was evening, they put them in jail until the next day. But many who heard the message believed,
[2197.26 --> 2204.14]  so the number of men who believed grew to about 5,000. The next day, the rulers, the elders, and
[2204.14 --> 2210.56]  the teachers of the law met in Jerusalem. Annas, the high priest, was there, and so were Caiaphas,
[2210.70 --> 2216.96]  John, Alexander, and others of the high priest's family. They had Peter and John brought before
[2216.96 --> 2225.04]  them and began to question them, by what power or what name did you do this? Then Peter, filled with
[2225.04 --> 2231.82]  the Holy Spirit, said to them, rulers and elders of the people, if we are being called to account
[2231.82 --> 2237.56]  today for an act of kindness shown to a man who was lame and are being asked how he was healed,
[2237.98 --> 2245.34]  then know this, you and all the people of Israel, it is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
[2245.48 --> 2251.66]  whom you crucified, but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed.
[2251.66 --> 2261.04]  Jesus is the stone you builders rejected, which has become the cornerstone. Salvation is found in
[2261.04 --> 2266.84]  no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.
[2268.62 --> 2274.78]  When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men,
[2275.06 --> 2278.84]  they were astonished and took note that these men had been with Jesus.
[2278.84 --> 2284.80]  But since they could see the men who had been healed standing there with them, there was nothing
[2284.80 --> 2290.82]  they could say. So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin and then conferred together.
[2292.14 --> 2297.28]  What are we going to do with these men? They asked. Everyone living in Jerusalem knows they have
[2297.28 --> 2303.50]  performed a notable sign. We cannot deny it, but to stop this thing from spreading any further among the
[2303.50 --> 2311.06]  people, we must warn them to speak no longer to anyone in this name. Then they called Peter and
[2311.06 --> 2316.66]  John in again and commanded them not to preach or teach at all in the name of Jesus. But Peter and John
[2316.66 --> 2327.74]  replied, which is right in God's eyes, to listen to you or to him? You be the judges. As for us,
[2327.74 --> 2335.96]  we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard. And after further threats, they let them go.
[2336.70 --> 2341.20]  They could not decide how to punish them because all the people were praising God for what had
[2341.20 --> 2348.62]  happened. For the man who was miraculously healed was over 40 years old. This is the word of the Lord.
[2348.62 --> 2360.44]  Now, there's a lot going on in this story, but for our time together this morning, I want to focus on
[2360.44 --> 2368.00]  one idea that really comes out of verse 20. Verse 20 is part of Peter's response, and he says,
[2368.38 --> 2376.74]  as for us, we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard. Peter and John cannot help
[2376.74 --> 2382.64]  speaking. Now, what that means is they can't but speak, right? There's nothing that's going to stop
[2382.64 --> 2389.08]  them from telling the people in front of them, whoever they happen to be, and whatever it might cost
[2389.08 --> 2398.18]  them what they have seen and heard and experienced and witnessed. Even if it costs them social capital,
[2398.58 --> 2404.58]  even if it costs them the pleasure of and the goodwill of the people around them, even if it costs
[2404.58 --> 2410.90]  them political power, even if it costs them an opportunity to influence leaders, even if it
[2410.90 --> 2421.08]  costs them their lives, they cannot help but speak. This is a continuation of a theme in many respects.
[2421.62 --> 2430.98]  At Pentecost, recorded for us in Acts 2, what this not helping but speak looked like is that
[2430.98 --> 2437.56]  the crowds that had gathered from all over Jerusalem thought the disciples were drunk,
[2438.34 --> 2445.18]  and they laughed at them, right? That's a social capital that they forfeited, that they had to
[2446.62 --> 2453.30]  endure. Here in this story, it refers to the political and religious elites, which are sort of
[2453.30 --> 2460.06]  one in the same in Jerusalem, the powerful of Jewish society. It's costing them political standing.
[2460.98 --> 2466.86]  And puts them in prison overnight. Later in the book of Acts, in front of the Roman authorities,
[2466.86 --> 2474.48]  it's going to cost some of them their lives. But still, even with all of that, they cannot help
[2474.48 --> 2481.76]  but speak about what they've seen and what they've heard. And that's really our theme for this morning
[2481.76 --> 2489.46]  from Acts 4, right? A boldness in proclaiming the gospel despite the cost. Boldness in proclaiming the
[2489.46 --> 2496.40]  gospel despite what it might cost the disciples to do. Now, I want to suggest this morning,
[2497.02 --> 2504.00]  and what we'll frame the rest of our time together around, is there are at least three reasons from our
[2504.00 --> 2510.64]  text why Peter and John and the rest of the apostles and the rest of the early church lived and
[2510.64 --> 2519.04]  experienced and proclaimed out of this boldness. And those three reasons, there's a moral reason,
[2519.72 --> 2528.04]  there's what I'm calling a magnify reason, and there's a mercy reason. Three Ms. Moral, magnify, mercy.
[2529.12 --> 2535.52]  And so let's start with that first one, the moral reason. To put it simply and plainly,
[2535.52 --> 2542.88]  the moral reason that they have to boldly proclaim is because Jesus told them to. He commanded them
[2542.88 --> 2550.22]  to. They were commanded by God to listen to Jesus. Actually, in the story of the transfiguration,
[2550.46 --> 2556.90]  one of the places you can read about that is in Matthew 17. Jesus takes Peter, James, and John,
[2557.12 --> 2562.78]  the same Peter and John that we read about in Acts 4. He takes them up a mountain, and before them,
[2562.78 --> 2569.54]  Jesus is transfigured. And what that means is he appears before them, his clothes are white as
[2569.54 --> 2577.12]  light, and his face shines like the sun, and beside him in this glory cloud appears Moses and Elijah,
[2577.12 --> 2586.18]  and they hear a voice from heaven that says, this is my son whom I love. With him I am well pleased.
[2586.18 --> 2596.88]  Listen to him. Right? The voice of God the Father says, listen to him. Obey him. God the Father speaks
[2596.88 --> 2603.94]  from heaven, and he tells his disciples who are standing there, listen to my son. And at the end
[2603.94 --> 2610.06]  of the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus commands those same disciples, right, not just Peter, James, and John,
[2610.06 --> 2617.34]  but all of them. He commands them in Matthew 28, saying, therefore go, make disciples of all nations,
[2617.50 --> 2622.54]  baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to
[2622.54 --> 2629.32]  obey everything I have commanded you. And it's the same thing in the beginning of the book of Acts,
[2629.46 --> 2636.98]  right? In chapter 1, before his ascension to heaven, Jesus says to the disciples, you will receive power
[2636.98 --> 2641.56]  when the Holy Spirit when the Holy Spirit comes on you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem,
[2641.56 --> 2650.04]  and Judea, and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. Right? Jesus commands them, go, make disciples,
[2650.84 --> 2663.34]  baptize them, teach them, be my witnesses. And so there's a moral reason for them to obey. Even
[2663.34 --> 2670.22]  though, Jesus warned them that when he gave these kinds of commands, it would be hard for them,
[2670.60 --> 2676.56]  and they would face opposition. There would be a cost to it, right? Jesus explicitly says that the
[2676.56 --> 2684.24]  world would hate them, right? In John 15, Jesus says, if the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated
[2684.24 --> 2692.48]  me first. And if you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to
[2692.48 --> 2700.58]  the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you. And when Jesus sent
[2700.58 --> 2707.40]  the 12 disciples out in Matthew again, he said, you will be hated by everyone because of me, but the one
[2707.40 --> 2714.72]  who stands firm to the end will be saved. Right? The disciples knew the cost, and they knew the command,
[2714.72 --> 2724.64]  and they would choose to obey the command of Jesus even with the cost. That's why Peter asks in verse 19,
[2724.76 --> 2731.04]  he says, which is right in God's eyes? Verse 19 of our text, chapter 4, which is right in God's eyes,
[2731.12 --> 2741.44]  to listen to you or to him? Right? If the choice is between obeying God or heeding the opinions of the
[2741.44 --> 2751.90]  world, disciples of Jesus choose obeying God. Now, fast forward 2,000 years, and this question is just
[2751.90 --> 2758.44]  as prescient for us. Right? What happens, and I don't want to fear monger, but I want to propose a
[2758.44 --> 2766.62]  possibility to you. What happens if our government, and God forbid this ever becomes true, but what
[2766.62 --> 2774.84]  happens if our government decided that calling for conversion, like genuine conversion, right?
[2775.42 --> 2781.40]  Repentance of life and sin, and walking away from what the Bible calls sin, what happens if our
[2781.40 --> 2789.44]  government ever said that's hate speech? Are we willing to pay that price and still call for the
[2789.44 --> 2797.22]  conversion of people to Jesus? Are we willing to obey in the face of a loss of social capital or
[2797.22 --> 2802.56]  privilege? Are we willing to pay in the face of fines that might be given or prison that might result?
[2805.40 --> 2809.32]  Now, there are places in the world where this is already happening.
[2811.06 --> 2815.44]  Are we willing to do that? Are we willing to endure that?
[2815.44 --> 2823.70]  What about Christians in other parts of the world? I know a young woman, a friend of ours, who's a missionary
[2823.70 --> 2831.28]  in a North African country where it's illegal to be a missionary, and she has to very carefully
[2831.28 --> 2838.66]  code her communications back to her supporters and her family, in part because she's worried that that
[2838.66 --> 2842.74]  email or that letter might be intercepted by the government and looked at.
[2842.74 --> 2853.38]  And if there's any mention of Jesus or mission or gospel in there, she's threatened, likely, with prison.
[2854.72 --> 2862.74]  And yet, this woman remains there and has for years quietly serving and seeing Jesus transform lives
[2862.74 --> 2864.62]  in this community that she lives in.
[2864.62 --> 2872.96]  And I've talked with missionaries and with pastors who've served in China or who have snuck across the border into North Korea,
[2872.96 --> 2878.88]  some of whom have been arrested and served time in prison, that the price that they are willing to pay
[2878.88 --> 2885.48]  and a cross that they are willing to bear because they are choosing obedience to God first.
[2885.48 --> 2892.92]  Now, these are really important realities for us to consider, really important questions for us to ask.
[2893.46 --> 2898.08]  And because of that, I also think it's important for us to see that their desire to obey,
[2898.22 --> 2909.76]  the disciples' desire to obey, must be fueled by something deeper than just a commitment to right or wrong,
[2909.76 --> 2912.64]  than just a commitment to the rule of God.
[2915.28 --> 2922.16]  I think we see that in our text, which is the second reason that we have, the magnify reason.
[2922.98 --> 2930.46]  And when I use the word magnify, what I mean is the make-much-of-Jesus reason, the worshipful reason, right?
[2930.46 --> 2941.76]  There's something supernatural, otherworldly, beautifully transcendent about why the disciple makes the bold choice to proclaim the gospel.
[2942.30 --> 2948.80]  Notice in verse 7, right, the question that is asked of Peter and John is,
[2949.00 --> 2952.04]  by what power or what name did you do this?
[2953.00 --> 2957.76]  Now, again, remember, Peter and John are called in front of the priests and the temple guards
[2957.76 --> 2960.76]  and the Sadducees, the rulers and the elders, the teachers of the law,
[2961.10 --> 2965.76]  all of the movers and shakers and power players of the Jewish population,
[2966.62 --> 2972.82]  to explain how it is and why it is that a man who was lame from birth,
[2972.98 --> 2975.72]  who sat begging and was known by everyone,
[2976.12 --> 2981.16]  is now standing and singing and shouting and jumping in praise to God.
[2982.36 --> 2983.66]  How could that happen?
[2983.66 --> 2988.80]  Peter explains in verse 16 of chapter 3, he says,
[2989.22 --> 2994.34]  By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see and know was made strong.
[2994.90 --> 2999.50]  It is Jesus' name and the faith that comes through him that has completely healed him,
[2999.94 --> 3001.72]  as you can all see.
[3003.28 --> 3007.18]  And so now in our text, the leaders ask that same question,
[3007.30 --> 3010.48]  by what power or name did you do this?
[3010.48 --> 3013.26]  And then we have two answers.
[3014.04 --> 3015.76]  In verse 8, we read,
[3016.18 --> 3019.90]  Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them.
[3020.84 --> 3024.18]  That little line, filled with the Holy Spirit, is crucial,
[3024.52 --> 3026.38]  because it's the power of the Holy Spirit,
[3026.68 --> 3028.74]  whom they have received at Pentecost,
[3028.84 --> 3033.04]  and whom has charged them and made them to be witnesses.
[3034.08 --> 3036.88]  Jesus commanded them to wait on the Spirit,
[3036.88 --> 3039.18]  and now they're following his command,
[3039.48 --> 3040.62]  having received the Spirit,
[3040.70 --> 3042.52]  to be witnesses and to make disciples,
[3042.86 --> 3044.22]  and to teach others to obey,
[3044.34 --> 3047.82]  to boldly and with courage proclaim the gospel.
[3049.00 --> 3051.62]  And then Peter, in the power of the Holy Spirit,
[3051.72 --> 3052.42]  he tells them,
[3052.94 --> 3056.28]  It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
[3056.38 --> 3057.52]  whom you crucified,
[3058.04 --> 3059.94]  but whom God raised from the dead,
[3060.12 --> 3062.96]  that this man stands before you healed.
[3062.96 --> 3066.20]  It is by the name of Jesus Christ.
[3067.50 --> 3069.30]  By what power or what name?
[3069.80 --> 3073.32]  The Holy Spirit and the name of Jesus.
[3074.56 --> 3074.94]  Right?
[3075.04 --> 3078.56]  This is the magnification of Jesus' name
[3078.56 --> 3082.38]  that answers the how and the why they must boldly proclaim.
[3082.64 --> 3084.96]  It's this magnification of Jesus' name
[3084.96 --> 3086.86]  and the power of the Holy Spirit
[3086.86 --> 3090.22]  that makes them able to obey the moral reason
[3090.22 --> 3092.52]  and want to live in that way
[3092.52 --> 3094.64]  and to declare as they have been called.
[3094.96 --> 3095.04]  Right?
[3095.10 --> 3098.68]  The act of proclaiming the name of Jesus Christ
[3098.68 --> 3101.58]  is lauding the glories of Christ.
[3102.02 --> 3105.02]  And just as the man who was healed
[3105.02 --> 3107.46]  went walking and leaping and praising God,
[3107.60 --> 3110.94]  so too Peter and John go praising God
[3110.94 --> 3113.62]  by their proclamation of the name of Jesus,
[3113.80 --> 3116.86]  by their proclamation of the life, death, resurrection,
[3116.86 --> 3119.44]  and exaltation of Jesus.
[3120.90 --> 3124.46]  Their ongoing worship moves them
[3124.46 --> 3127.50]  to magnify Jesus in the streets.
[3128.00 --> 3129.50]  They cannot but help it.
[3130.46 --> 3134.22]  They cannot help speaking about what they have seen and heard
[3134.22 --> 3135.84]  because it is magnificent.
[3137.94 --> 3139.76]  And let's be real candid here
[3139.76 --> 3142.68]  because it's human nature, I believe,
[3142.78 --> 3144.80]  human nature to proclaim,
[3144.80 --> 3147.14]  to shout from the mountaintops
[3147.14 --> 3149.56]  those things that we believe to be magnificent.
[3151.02 --> 3151.50]  Right?
[3151.52 --> 3153.02]  When you're amazed by something,
[3153.18 --> 3155.14]  you share it with the people around you.
[3156.64 --> 3159.30]  And have you ever tried to show someone something
[3159.30 --> 3162.22]  that you found or that you thought was amazing?
[3162.62 --> 3163.84]  Maybe it's a sports highlight.
[3164.46 --> 3167.40]  Maybe it's a car that you see on the road
[3167.40 --> 3169.06]  or something that you're super interested
[3169.06 --> 3169.90]  and that you love.
[3170.06 --> 3171.50]  And you show them and you say,
[3171.58 --> 3172.62]  isn't this magnificent?
[3172.62 --> 3174.90]  And they look at you and they go,
[3175.40 --> 3176.42]  I guess so.
[3177.08 --> 3177.44]  Maybe.
[3178.38 --> 3180.00]  I mean, you love it, so okay.
[3180.70 --> 3182.32]  Has that ever happened to you or is that only me?
[3184.22 --> 3184.80]  Only me.
[3184.90 --> 3185.54]  Okay, thank you.
[3186.58 --> 3188.28]  But even still, right,
[3188.34 --> 3189.10]  you love it,
[3189.34 --> 3190.44]  so you're undaunted.
[3191.90 --> 3192.24]  Right?
[3192.28 --> 3193.30]  You think it's magnificent,
[3193.52 --> 3194.66]  so you go, okay, fine.
[3194.72 --> 3195.42]  If you don't care,
[3195.50 --> 3196.74]  then I'm going to find someone who does.
[3196.74 --> 3202.78]  Malachi and I like to watch highlights of Lionel Messi
[3202.78 --> 3204.92]  running down the field
[3204.92 --> 3207.14]  and deacon out 10 other players on the other team
[3207.14 --> 3209.30]  and then beautifully putting it top bins.
[3209.52 --> 3210.00]  Right, Malachi?
[3211.82 --> 3212.76]  Rachel doesn't care.
[3213.48 --> 3214.92]  So we find someone who does.
[3216.20 --> 3217.56]  We go and share that
[3217.56 --> 3218.92]  because we think it's magnificent.
[3220.36 --> 3220.46]  Right?
[3221.02 --> 3222.30]  Magnifying something
[3222.30 --> 3224.80]  motivates you to make it known.
[3224.80 --> 3229.40]  Now this magnifying reason,
[3229.50 --> 3231.08]  I think actually could also be called
[3231.08 --> 3233.30]  a miraculous reason.
[3234.10 --> 3234.22]  Right?
[3234.24 --> 3235.38]  It's a miraculous reason
[3235.38 --> 3237.10]  because something miraculous
[3237.10 --> 3238.42]  has happened in front of them.
[3239.08 --> 3240.22]  Notice again what Peter says.
[3240.60 --> 3241.94]  Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
[3242.08 --> 3243.04]  whom you crucified,
[3243.48 --> 3244.24]  you killed him.
[3244.66 --> 3245.56]  He was dead,
[3246.02 --> 3249.06]  but whom God raised from the dead.
[3250.32 --> 3251.90]  And then that miracle of resurrection
[3251.90 --> 3253.86]  is reason enough for them
[3253.86 --> 3255.10]  to boldly proclaim.
[3256.04 --> 3256.14]  Right?
[3256.16 --> 3257.74]  If God can raise the dead,
[3258.18 --> 3260.04]  surely he can raise dead hearts.
[3261.30 --> 3261.46]  Right?
[3261.48 --> 3262.66]  If God can raise the dead,
[3263.04 --> 3264.34]  surely I can stand here
[3264.34 --> 3265.36]  in the face of death
[3265.36 --> 3266.34]  and not be afraid.
[3268.54 --> 3269.82]  God raised the dead.
[3269.94 --> 3272.06]  The disciples saw Jesus dead
[3272.06 --> 3273.70]  and then three days later,
[3273.78 --> 3274.82]  they saw him alive
[3274.82 --> 3276.00]  and they lived with him
[3276.00 --> 3276.76]  and talked with him
[3276.76 --> 3277.46]  and walked with him
[3277.46 --> 3279.34]  and ate with this resurrected Jesus
[3279.34 --> 3280.62]  for 40 days
[3280.62 --> 3281.86]  before he was taken up
[3281.86 --> 3283.12]  in front of their very eyes.
[3283.26 --> 3285.12]  Of course they're going to talk about that.
[3286.06 --> 3287.00]  How could they not?
[3287.96 --> 3288.84]  It's magnificent.
[3289.24 --> 3290.10]  It's amazing.
[3290.30 --> 3291.14]  It's majestic.
[3291.32 --> 3292.12]  It's miraculous.
[3293.18 --> 3296.14]  And the same must be true for us today.
[3296.22 --> 3297.18]  How could it not be?
[3297.46 --> 3297.58]  Right?
[3297.62 --> 3298.76]  When you experience
[3298.76 --> 3299.74]  this miraculous,
[3300.00 --> 3301.00]  resurrected Jesus
[3301.00 --> 3302.22]  as real,
[3302.48 --> 3304.40]  how could you not proclaim that?
[3304.54 --> 3306.18]  How could you not magnify him?
[3307.28 --> 3307.52]  Right?
[3307.54 --> 3309.86]  When you see an unexpected answer to prayer,
[3310.82 --> 3312.92]  when you're touched by God in worship,
[3314.24 --> 3315.92]  don't you want to tell someone about that?
[3317.20 --> 3318.72]  Can't you but share it?
[3320.18 --> 3320.36]  Right?
[3320.40 --> 3321.96]  When God has changed your life,
[3322.72 --> 3325.14]  tell the story of God changing your life
[3325.14 --> 3327.26]  because that's what God does.
[3327.92 --> 3329.10]  He changes lives.
[3329.10 --> 3331.52]  Part of our magnifying him
[3331.52 --> 3333.42]  is telling the story
[3333.42 --> 3334.94]  of him changing our lives,
[3335.10 --> 3336.50]  transforming us.
[3339.00 --> 3340.46]  Now this brings us
[3340.46 --> 3342.10]  then to the third
[3342.10 --> 3343.72]  and final reason
[3343.72 --> 3345.38]  to boldly proclaim the gospel.
[3346.30 --> 3347.12]  And I'm calling this
[3347.12 --> 3348.80]  the mercy reason.
[3349.58 --> 3351.12]  Notice what Peter says in verse 12.
[3351.98 --> 3352.36]  He says,
[3352.48 --> 3354.42]  Salvation is found in no one else
[3354.42 --> 3355.58]  for there's no under name
[3355.58 --> 3356.56]  under heaven
[3356.56 --> 3357.42]  given to mankind
[3357.42 --> 3359.84]  by which we must be saved.
[3359.84 --> 3362.58]  Now the third reason here
[3362.58 --> 3364.64]  is sort of the capstone reason
[3364.64 --> 3366.48]  and it might be the most important
[3366.48 --> 3367.58]  because working backwards
[3367.58 --> 3368.72]  it changes all the others
[3368.72 --> 3371.70]  and supports all the others.
[3372.46 --> 3373.38]  We cannot help
[3373.38 --> 3375.48]  speaking about what we have seen and heard
[3375.48 --> 3377.04]  because what we have seen and heard
[3377.04 --> 3378.62]  is the only way
[3378.62 --> 3380.66]  that God has made salvation possible.
[3381.18 --> 3382.72]  There's no other name
[3382.72 --> 3383.54]  under heaven
[3383.54 --> 3384.44]  given to mankind
[3384.44 --> 3386.48]  by which we must be saved.
[3386.48 --> 3388.80]  Now,
[3389.54 --> 3391.18]  if you have ears to hear that
[3391.18 --> 3393.90]  in today's pluralistic world
[3393.90 --> 3395.40]  that is an impossibly
[3395.40 --> 3396.78]  controversial thing to say.
[3398.38 --> 3399.68]  But just so you don't think
[3399.68 --> 3400.58]  these are my words
[3400.58 --> 3402.42]  hear these words
[3402.42 --> 3403.28]  from Jesus.
[3403.52 --> 3404.66]  Matthew 11, 27.
[3405.10 --> 3406.44]  No one knows the Father
[3406.44 --> 3407.52]  except the Son
[3407.52 --> 3408.86]  and those to whom
[3408.86 --> 3409.92]  the Son chooses
[3409.92 --> 3411.24]  to reveal Him.
[3412.44 --> 3413.70]  Or John 3, 16.
[3414.18 --> 3414.42]  Right?
[3414.42 --> 3415.82]  Most of us know that first verse.
[3415.98 --> 3417.06]  For God so loved the world
[3417.06 --> 3418.80]  that He gave His one and only Son
[3418.80 --> 3420.02]  that whoever believes in Him
[3420.02 --> 3420.78]  shall not perish
[3420.78 --> 3421.92]  but have eternal life.
[3422.08 --> 3422.84]  How many of us know
[3422.84 --> 3424.00]  the second verse is here?
[3424.38 --> 3426.02]  For God did not send His Son
[3426.02 --> 3426.74]  into the world
[3426.74 --> 3427.66]  to condemn the world
[3427.66 --> 3428.86]  but to save the world
[3428.86 --> 3429.58]  through Him.
[3430.00 --> 3431.64]  Whoever believes in Him
[3431.64 --> 3432.96]  is not condemned.
[3434.20 --> 3435.78]  But whoever does not believe
[3435.78 --> 3437.38]  stands condemned already
[3437.38 --> 3439.20]  because they have not believed
[3439.20 --> 3440.76]  in the name of God's one
[3440.76 --> 3442.32]  and only Son.
[3442.32 --> 3445.80]  Jesus explicitly
[3445.80 --> 3447.34]  in John 14, verse 6
[3447.34 --> 3447.58]  says,
[3447.82 --> 3448.38]  I am the way,
[3448.50 --> 3448.86]  the truth,
[3448.90 --> 3449.36]  and the life.
[3449.76 --> 3451.16]  No one comes to the Father
[3451.16 --> 3452.66]  except through Me.
[3453.46 --> 3454.16]  Or Paul writes
[3454.16 --> 3454.82]  in 1 Timothy,
[3454.94 --> 3456.20]  for there is one God
[3456.20 --> 3457.04]  and one mediator
[3457.04 --> 3458.44]  between God and mankind,
[3458.58 --> 3459.74]  the man Jesus Christ.
[3460.30 --> 3461.18]  Or in 1 John,
[3461.44 --> 3462.70]  the same John possibly
[3462.70 --> 3463.48]  who was here,
[3463.76 --> 3464.36]  probably,
[3464.56 --> 3465.86]  who was here in this moment
[3465.86 --> 3467.78]  writes to the elders
[3467.78 --> 3468.58]  and to the churches
[3468.58 --> 3469.56]  in 1 John 5.
[3469.64 --> 3469.92]  He says,
[3469.92 --> 3471.00]  whoever has the Son
[3471.00 --> 3471.78]  has life,
[3472.12 --> 3473.18]  whoever does not have
[3473.18 --> 3474.00]  the Son of God
[3474.00 --> 3476.06]  does not have life.
[3478.24 --> 3478.64]  Now again,
[3478.80 --> 3479.54]  some people
[3479.54 --> 3481.04]  in our world today,
[3481.18 --> 3482.76]  even us sitting here
[3482.76 --> 3483.40]  this morning,
[3483.66 --> 3484.36]  might say,
[3484.66 --> 3485.32]  Pastor,
[3485.44 --> 3487.20]  that's a really hard teaching.
[3488.40 --> 3489.38]  This message
[3489.38 --> 3490.50]  on the exclusivity
[3490.50 --> 3491.42]  of Christ
[3491.42 --> 3494.68]  is not very fair
[3494.68 --> 3496.80]  in the world around us.
[3496.80 --> 3499.08]  But can I just say
[3499.08 --> 3502.26]  that all truth,
[3502.44 --> 3503.12]  any claim
[3503.12 --> 3504.30]  to a particular idea
[3504.30 --> 3505.06]  is exclusive.
[3506.26 --> 3506.90]  At any time
[3506.90 --> 3508.04]  we claim one thing,
[3508.24 --> 3509.12]  it means we're
[3509.12 --> 3510.82]  excluding the other things
[3510.82 --> 3511.62]  from it.
[3512.00 --> 3513.28]  No matter what you do
[3513.28 --> 3514.32]  or what you say,
[3514.40 --> 3514.98]  you're always
[3514.98 --> 3516.00]  excluding something.
[3516.10 --> 3516.70]  It's impossible
[3516.70 --> 3517.64]  to not.
[3520.14 --> 3520.94]  And so maybe,
[3521.70 --> 3523.26]  at least for this moment,
[3523.92 --> 3524.62]  we'll trust
[3524.62 --> 3525.76]  the words of Jesus
[3525.76 --> 3526.68]  when He says
[3526.68 --> 3528.00]  that He's the only way
[3528.00 --> 3529.40]  or the words
[3529.40 --> 3530.40]  of Peter and John
[3530.40 --> 3530.92]  when they say
[3530.92 --> 3531.44]  that salvation
[3531.44 --> 3532.68]  is found in no one else
[3532.68 --> 3535.98]  because it's come to us
[3535.98 --> 3537.64]  by the Spirit of God
[3537.64 --> 3538.92]  to hear that.
[3539.78 --> 3541.06]  And it's not arrogant
[3541.06 --> 3542.24]  to say that
[3542.24 --> 3543.86]  when it turns out
[3543.86 --> 3544.56]  that it's right.
[3545.86 --> 3547.56]  It's just true.
[3547.56 --> 3551.76]  In fact,
[3552.20 --> 3554.66]  to not say it
[3554.66 --> 3556.62]  isn't to just deny
[3556.62 --> 3557.42]  its truth.
[3557.94 --> 3558.90]  What we're hearing here
[3558.90 --> 3560.46]  is to actually rob people
[3560.46 --> 3562.14]  of the joy of salvation,
[3562.50 --> 3563.24]  of the possibility
[3563.24 --> 3563.88]  of salvation.
[3564.24 --> 3564.70]  And so,
[3564.90 --> 3566.72]  we must boldly proclaim
[3566.72 --> 3567.78]  this idea
[3567.78 --> 3568.84]  and this truth.
[3568.84 --> 3574.02]  But to do so
[3574.02 --> 3574.96]  will cost something.
[3577.20 --> 3578.28]  There's a story
[3578.28 --> 3580.86]  from the second century
[3580.86 --> 3582.94]  about the arrest,
[3583.38 --> 3583.70]  trial,
[3583.86 --> 3584.52]  and ultimately
[3584.52 --> 3585.48]  martyrdom,
[3585.62 --> 3586.10]  execution,
[3586.48 --> 3588.30]  of a man named Polycarp.
[3588.98 --> 3590.22]  He's the bishop
[3590.22 --> 3591.42]  of Smyrna.
[3592.70 --> 3592.86]  Now,
[3592.98 --> 3593.72]  Polycarp
[3593.72 --> 3597.20]  is connected to
[3597.20 --> 3598.14]  as a disciple,
[3598.88 --> 3599.80]  John,
[3600.08 --> 3600.78]  mentioned here
[3600.78 --> 3601.88]  in the text.
[3602.92 --> 3603.04]  Now,
[3603.06 --> 3604.14]  Polycarp is betrayed
[3604.14 --> 3605.36]  by a servant
[3605.36 --> 3606.94]  and is arrested
[3606.94 --> 3608.16]  by Roman soldiers.
[3609.38 --> 3610.14]  The story goes
[3610.14 --> 3610.80]  that he welcomes
[3610.80 --> 3611.62]  them calmly
[3611.62 --> 3612.98]  and he asks
[3612.98 --> 3614.18]  for a time to pray
[3614.18 --> 3615.50]  and then he goes
[3615.50 --> 3616.18]  with them willingly.
[3617.08 --> 3618.00]  And then he's taken
[3618.00 --> 3619.30]  to a stadium
[3619.30 --> 3620.24]  where there's
[3620.24 --> 3621.02]  a large crowd
[3621.02 --> 3621.76]  that has gathered
[3621.76 --> 3622.54]  and awaited
[3622.54 --> 3623.62]  and the proconsul
[3623.62 --> 3624.60]  Quintus
[3624.60 --> 3625.68]  urges him
[3625.68 --> 3626.82]  to renounce
[3626.82 --> 3627.48]  his faith
[3627.48 --> 3628.36]  and to swear
[3628.36 --> 3629.40]  by the fortune
[3629.40 --> 3630.38]  of Caesar.
[3630.92 --> 3631.16]  Right?
[3631.22 --> 3631.72]  In so doing
[3631.72 --> 3632.80]  to curse Christ
[3632.80 --> 3633.56]  in order to save
[3633.56 --> 3634.04]  his life.
[3634.42 --> 3634.56]  Now,
[3634.62 --> 3635.04]  interestingly,
[3635.54 --> 3636.64]  we have documents
[3636.64 --> 3637.48]  from this time
[3637.48 --> 3638.70]  that name Quintus
[3638.70 --> 3639.94]  as the proconsul
[3639.94 --> 3641.28]  of the region
[3641.28 --> 3641.86]  of Smyrna.
[3642.78 --> 3643.82]  So this really happened.
[3646.08 --> 3646.94]  And Polycarp
[3646.94 --> 3648.42]  standing before Quintus
[3648.42 --> 3649.80]  famously responds.
[3649.96 --> 3650.28]  He says,
[3651.04 --> 3652.32]  Eighty and six years
[3652.32 --> 3653.26]  have I served him.
[3653.62 --> 3654.70]  For those of you
[3654.70 --> 3655.66]  for whom math is hard,
[3655.74 --> 3656.22]  that means he's
[3656.22 --> 3657.28]  86 years old.
[3658.34 --> 3658.68]  Right?
[3658.72 --> 3659.50]  He's not a young man.
[3660.92 --> 3661.14]  Right?
[3661.22 --> 3662.06]  He is old
[3662.06 --> 3662.72]  and bold
[3662.72 --> 3663.84]  in his faith.
[3664.56 --> 3665.60]  Eighty and six years
[3665.60 --> 3666.56]  have I served him
[3666.56 --> 3668.04]  and he has done me
[3668.04 --> 3669.10]  no wrong.
[3669.66 --> 3670.30]  How then
[3670.30 --> 3671.46]  can I blaspheme
[3671.46 --> 3672.10]  my king
[3672.10 --> 3673.24]  and my savior?
[3674.34 --> 3675.36]  And his speech continues.
[3675.48 --> 3676.34]  He steadfastly
[3676.34 --> 3677.52]  refuses to renounce
[3677.52 --> 3677.96]  his faith.
[3678.28 --> 3678.48]  In fact,
[3678.52 --> 3679.04]  at one point,
[3679.10 --> 3679.70]  he looks straight
[3679.70 --> 3680.38]  at Quintus,
[3680.46 --> 3681.18]  the proconsul,
[3681.26 --> 3681.84]  the leader,
[3682.22 --> 3682.70]  the governing
[3682.70 --> 3683.66]  Roman authority
[3683.66 --> 3684.86]  and he says,
[3685.30 --> 3686.74]  since you are insisting
[3686.74 --> 3687.58]  that I should swear
[3687.58 --> 3688.70]  by Caesar's fortune
[3688.70 --> 3689.64]  and act like
[3689.64 --> 3690.94]  you don't know
[3690.94 --> 3691.74]  who I am,
[3691.84 --> 3692.62]  let me tell you
[3692.62 --> 3694.18]  clearly and with boldness,
[3694.40 --> 3695.62]  I am a Christian.
[3696.48 --> 3697.40]  And I love this.
[3697.72 --> 3697.98]  He says,
[3698.08 --> 3698.94]  if you want to learn
[3698.94 --> 3700.00]  about Christian beliefs,
[3700.52 --> 3701.06]  set a time
[3701.06 --> 3701.66]  and I'll explain
[3701.66 --> 3702.18]  them for you.
[3703.44 --> 3704.22]  And so he's standing
[3704.22 --> 3705.04]  in front of this guy
[3705.04 --> 3705.94]  who's about to kill him
[3705.94 --> 3706.34]  and he says,
[3706.50 --> 3707.50]  do you want me
[3707.50 --> 3708.54]  to tell you about Jesus?
[3709.78 --> 3710.66]  Let's set a time.
[3710.78 --> 3711.76]  Maybe it can be next week.
[3712.52 --> 3712.98]  You know,
[3713.00 --> 3713.62]  we don't have to follow
[3713.62 --> 3714.16]  through with this,
[3714.28 --> 3715.02]  but he says,
[3715.06 --> 3715.72]  let me tell you
[3715.72 --> 3716.68]  about Jesus.
[3717.90 --> 3719.00]  Now the proconsul
[3719.00 --> 3720.62]  continues to pressure him,
[3720.74 --> 3721.22]  threatening him
[3721.22 --> 3722.00]  with wild beasts
[3722.00 --> 3722.66]  and with fire
[3722.66 --> 3724.30]  and Polycop remains
[3724.30 --> 3725.44]  unshaken,
[3725.60 --> 3725.92]  saying,
[3726.26 --> 3726.58]  actually,
[3726.72 --> 3727.26]  that the fire
[3727.26 --> 3728.16]  that you threaten me
[3728.16 --> 3729.18]  with will be temporary.
[3729.78 --> 3730.68]  The fire of judgment
[3730.68 --> 3731.84]  reserved for all those
[3731.84 --> 3733.24]  ungodly is eternal,
[3733.46 --> 3734.28]  so I don't care
[3734.28 --> 3734.96]  about your fire.
[3735.94 --> 3736.86]  And so the crowd
[3736.86 --> 3737.80]  starts to demand
[3737.80 --> 3739.16]  Polycarp be burned alive
[3739.16 --> 3740.06]  and so he's taken
[3740.06 --> 3741.30]  to a stake
[3741.30 --> 3742.30]  where they offer
[3742.30 --> 3743.72]  to nail him to it
[3743.72 --> 3744.30]  because,
[3744.78 --> 3745.48]  as you can imagine,
[3745.58 --> 3746.14]  when people start
[3746.14 --> 3746.82]  feeling the flames,
[3746.90 --> 3747.64]  they try to run away.
[3748.52 --> 3749.62]  And Polycarp says,
[3750.90 --> 3751.78]  God will give me
[3751.78 --> 3752.98]  the strength to endure.
[3753.36 --> 3754.00]  You don't need
[3754.00 --> 3754.80]  to nail me
[3754.80 --> 3755.78]  to this pyre.
[3756.00 --> 3756.78]  I will stay.
[3758.24 --> 3759.64]  And as the fire is lit,
[3760.02 --> 3761.34]  Polycarp prays,
[3761.42 --> 3761.94]  thanks God
[3761.94 --> 3762.66]  for the opportunity
[3762.66 --> 3763.90]  to join the martyrs
[3763.90 --> 3764.86]  and to partake
[3764.86 --> 3765.96]  in Christ's suffering.
[3766.42 --> 3767.20]  And as the story
[3767.20 --> 3767.90]  is told,
[3768.32 --> 3769.14]  miraculously,
[3769.38 --> 3770.00]  the flames
[3770.00 --> 3771.14]  did not touch him.
[3771.42 --> 3772.14]  As you read it,
[3772.34 --> 3773.70]  it says that they appeared
[3773.70 --> 3775.02]  in like a dome
[3775.02 --> 3775.80]  around him
[3775.80 --> 3776.46]  and they could not
[3776.46 --> 3776.92]  come in.
[3777.22 --> 3778.04]  And so eventually,
[3778.72 --> 3779.98]  one of the Roman guards
[3779.98 --> 3780.76]  had to go
[3780.76 --> 3781.10]  and kill him
[3781.10 --> 3781.60]  with a sword.
[3782.76 --> 3783.62]  I imagine that guard
[3783.62 --> 3784.16]  got burned
[3784.16 --> 3785.70]  in doing that.
[3787.46 --> 3788.66]  This is the legacy
[3788.66 --> 3789.86]  of our faith
[3789.86 --> 3790.54]  and those who
[3790.54 --> 3791.54]  boldly proclaim
[3791.54 --> 3793.60]  regardless of the cost.
[3793.60 --> 3795.38]  And let me be really clear,
[3795.46 --> 3797.00]  this continues to today.
[3797.22 --> 3797.74]  How many of you
[3797.74 --> 3800.14]  remember or heard
[3800.14 --> 3800.74]  the story
[3800.74 --> 3803.22]  of Pastor Andrew Bunsen?
[3803.34 --> 3804.60]  He's an American pastor.
[3805.06 --> 3805.76]  In 2016,
[3805.76 --> 3806.74]  he was arrested
[3806.74 --> 3807.36]  in Turkey.
[3808.38 --> 3809.10]  He was accused
[3809.10 --> 3810.14]  of espionage
[3810.14 --> 3810.90]  and terrorism
[3810.90 --> 3812.78]  charges that he
[3812.78 --> 3813.58]  and his supporters
[3813.58 --> 3814.42]  have continued
[3814.42 --> 3815.56]  to deny.
[3816.50 --> 3818.14]  But during his imprisonment,
[3818.24 --> 3819.08]  he's written a book
[3819.08 --> 3819.42]  on it,
[3819.60 --> 3821.14]  he remains steadfast
[3821.14 --> 3821.82]  and faithful
[3821.82 --> 3822.62]  and he continues
[3822.62 --> 3823.64]  to proclaim
[3823.64 --> 3824.88]  his Christian beliefs.
[3825.50 --> 3826.12]  And his case
[3826.12 --> 3826.88]  eventually drew
[3826.88 --> 3827.96]  international attention
[3827.96 --> 3829.36]  and he was eventually
[3829.36 --> 3830.60]  released in 2018
[3830.60 --> 3832.18]  after significant
[3832.18 --> 3833.48]  diplomatic efforts.
[3834.76 --> 3836.06]  But he has gone on
[3836.06 --> 3836.48]  to say
[3836.48 --> 3837.44]  that he would do it
[3837.44 --> 3837.88]  all again
[3837.88 --> 3839.46]  for the gospel.
[3840.74 --> 3841.34]  Or,
[3841.52 --> 3842.42]  how many of you
[3842.42 --> 3843.48]  remember the story
[3843.48 --> 3845.52]  of one John Chow,
[3845.98 --> 3846.82]  who was a missionary
[3846.82 --> 3849.24]  who was attempting
[3849.24 --> 3850.94]  to evangelize
[3850.94 --> 3854.08]  the Sentinelese people
[3854.08 --> 3856.18]  on North Sentinel Island,
[3856.70 --> 3859.00]  which is in the Andaman
[3859.00 --> 3861.32]  and Nicobar Islands.
[3861.84 --> 3862.84]  Now, the Sentinelese
[3862.84 --> 3863.62]  are known
[3863.62 --> 3864.66]  for their isolation
[3864.66 --> 3865.92]  from the outside world.
[3866.26 --> 3866.68]  They're known
[3866.68 --> 3867.80]  for their hostility
[3867.80 --> 3869.02]  toward anyone
[3869.02 --> 3869.82]  who sets foot
[3869.82 --> 3870.48]  on their sand.
[3871.82 --> 3872.82]  And Chow is eventually
[3872.82 --> 3873.30]  killed
[3873.30 --> 3874.72]  by the Sentinelese people
[3874.72 --> 3876.12]  in November of 2018
[3876.12 --> 3877.56]  for his attempt
[3877.56 --> 3878.68]  to preach to them.
[3879.84 --> 3880.92]  And at the time,
[3881.02 --> 3881.64]  if you remember,
[3881.72 --> 3883.10]  this was widely covered
[3883.10 --> 3883.90]  by the media
[3883.90 --> 3885.96]  and there were two stories
[3885.96 --> 3886.64]  being told.
[3887.96 --> 3888.10]  Right?
[3888.16 --> 3889.02]  On the one hand,
[3889.30 --> 3890.18]  you heard the story
[3890.18 --> 3893.22]  of a colonizer
[3893.22 --> 3894.80]  who tried to bring
[3894.80 --> 3895.64]  a Christian gospel
[3895.64 --> 3896.92]  to a non-Christian nation
[3896.92 --> 3898.28]  and how dare he
[3898.28 --> 3899.82]  have the audacity
[3899.82 --> 3900.90]  to do that.
[3902.56 --> 3903.58]  And on the other hand,
[3903.86 --> 3905.02]  you heard the story
[3905.02 --> 3907.54]  of someone
[3907.54 --> 3909.08]  who was faithful
[3909.08 --> 3909.96]  to God's call
[3909.96 --> 3910.70]  on their life
[3910.70 --> 3911.76]  to go and preach
[3911.76 --> 3912.30]  the gospel,
[3913.18 --> 3914.54]  to go and declare
[3914.54 --> 3915.28]  that salvation
[3915.28 --> 3915.80]  is found
[3915.80 --> 3916.56]  in no other name
[3916.56 --> 3917.40]  than Jesus Christ.
[3917.58 --> 3919.08]  And where you stood
[3919.08 --> 3920.90]  on that issue
[3920.90 --> 3923.62]  in large part
[3923.62 --> 3925.30]  has to do with
[3925.30 --> 3926.54]  whether or not
[3926.54 --> 3927.18]  you think
[3927.18 --> 3928.26]  the mercy reason,
[3928.40 --> 3929.42]  the magnify reason,
[3929.42 --> 3930.44]  and the moral reason
[3930.44 --> 3931.68]  are legitimate,
[3932.32 --> 3932.96]  are true.
[3932.96 --> 3935.56]  Right?
[3935.60 --> 3936.86]  If you really believe
[3936.86 --> 3938.12]  that there is
[3938.12 --> 3939.04]  no other name
[3939.04 --> 3939.94]  in heaven
[3939.94 --> 3941.38]  and on the earth
[3941.38 --> 3942.22]  by which men
[3942.22 --> 3943.38]  must be saved,
[3944.52 --> 3945.20]  then you will go
[3945.20 --> 3945.94]  and declare it
[3945.94 --> 3946.88]  and proclaim it.
[3947.32 --> 3948.58]  If you really believe
[3948.58 --> 3949.72]  that an extension
[3949.72 --> 3951.58]  of our worshiping life
[3951.58 --> 3952.22]  in Jesus
[3952.22 --> 3954.28]  is to tell this thing,
[3954.56 --> 3955.52]  this amazing,
[3955.74 --> 3957.00]  amazing story,
[3958.00 --> 3959.38]  then you're going to go
[3959.38 --> 3960.54]  and do it.
[3960.54 --> 3962.92]  And if you really believe
[3962.92 --> 3964.54]  that God has commanded us
[3964.54 --> 3965.14]  to go
[3965.14 --> 3966.80]  to listen to His Son
[3966.80 --> 3967.82]  and to make disciples
[3967.82 --> 3968.94]  and teach them to obey,
[3969.06 --> 3970.08]  to be witnesses
[3970.08 --> 3971.62]  in Judea and Samaria
[3971.62 --> 3972.54]  and to the ends
[3972.54 --> 3972.98]  of the earth,
[3973.10 --> 3975.08]  even the Sanateles Islands,
[3976.28 --> 3977.04]  then you're going to go
[3977.04 --> 3978.50]  and you're going to do it.
[3979.00 --> 3980.04]  Now let me be really clear.
[3980.38 --> 3980.82]  There were some
[3980.82 --> 3982.00]  significant questions
[3982.00 --> 3982.76]  about the wisdom
[3982.76 --> 3983.80]  of how He did it
[3983.80 --> 3984.80]  and the support systems
[3984.80 --> 3986.02]  that He didn't have in place.
[3986.50 --> 3988.04]  And those are legitimate questions
[3988.04 --> 3988.72]  worth asking
[3988.72 --> 3989.68]  and reflecting upon.
[3989.94 --> 3991.00]  But the issue
[3991.00 --> 3992.38]  at hand
[3992.38 --> 3995.82]  is will you hear
[3995.82 --> 3998.22]  the moral
[3998.22 --> 3999.86]  and the magnificent
[3999.86 --> 4002.52]  and the merciful reasons
[4002.52 --> 4003.30]  of God
[4003.30 --> 4004.00]  to go
[4004.00 --> 4005.60]  and to boldly
[4005.60 --> 4006.40]  proclaim
[4006.40 --> 4008.56]  this gospel.
[4010.28 --> 4011.06]  Now let me, again,
[4011.16 --> 4012.22]  be abundantly clear.
[4012.42 --> 4013.86]  Not every one of us
[4013.86 --> 4014.96]  is going to have to stand
[4014.96 --> 4015.82]  before leaders
[4015.82 --> 4016.54]  and officials
[4016.54 --> 4018.42]  and make this kind of case.
[4019.88 --> 4021.08]  But every one of us
[4021.08 --> 4022.10]  will have to stand
[4022.10 --> 4023.54]  before a friend
[4023.54 --> 4025.04]  who disagrees
[4025.04 --> 4026.50]  or a teammate
[4026.50 --> 4027.90]  who's making fun,
[4028.92 --> 4029.08]  right,
[4029.12 --> 4030.20]  or a colleague
[4030.20 --> 4030.90]  at work
[4030.90 --> 4031.82]  who just doesn't get it.
[4032.74 --> 4034.16]  And in that moment
[4034.16 --> 4036.34]  will the magnificence
[4036.34 --> 4037.34]  of Jesus,
[4037.90 --> 4038.76]  in that moment
[4038.76 --> 4039.92]  will the mercy
[4039.92 --> 4041.58]  of God's grace,
[4042.00 --> 4042.82]  in that moment
[4042.82 --> 4043.98]  will the command
[4043.98 --> 4044.78]  of God Himself
[4044.78 --> 4046.28]  to listen to His Son
[4046.28 --> 4047.48]  be enough
[4047.48 --> 4048.06]  for us
[4048.06 --> 4049.64]  to boldly proclaim
[4049.64 --> 4052.06]  His gospel.
[4053.90 --> 4055.36]  I pray that it is.
[4056.76 --> 4057.42]  And I pray
[4057.42 --> 4058.04]  that we see
[4058.04 --> 4058.70]  the fruit
[4058.70 --> 4060.18]  of that boldness
[4060.18 --> 4061.08]  every day
[4061.08 --> 4064.12]  because of the grace
[4064.12 --> 4065.18]  of God
[4065.18 --> 4065.98]  and the work
[4065.98 --> 4067.50]  of His Holy Spirit
[4067.50 --> 4068.12]  among us.
[4068.58 --> 4068.82]  Amen?
[4069.66 --> 4070.74]  Let's pray together.
[4070.74 --> 4075.04]  Lord,
[4075.20 --> 4076.48]  our God,
[4076.58 --> 4077.52]  You are so good.
[4077.64 --> 4079.34]  You are so magnificent.
[4080.28 --> 4081.92]  You are majestic.
[4083.88 --> 4085.36]  Move in us
[4085.36 --> 4087.56]  to boldly declare
[4087.56 --> 4089.14]  this truth.
[4089.80 --> 4090.58]  Remind us
[4090.58 --> 4091.66]  of Your gospel
[4091.66 --> 4093.44]  and transform us
[4093.44 --> 4094.16]  as we go
[4094.16 --> 4095.00]  from this place
[4095.00 --> 4095.76]  today.
[4095.76 --> 4098.88]  fill us
[4098.88 --> 4100.34]  so with courage
[4100.34 --> 4101.48]  and boldness
[4101.48 --> 4102.28]  that we cannot
[4102.28 --> 4103.72]  but speak
[4103.72 --> 4105.04]  of what we have
[4105.04 --> 4105.50]  seen
[4105.50 --> 4106.66]  and heard.
[4107.46 --> 4108.12]  We pray this,
[4108.26 --> 4108.40]  Jesus,
[4108.58 --> 4109.16]  in Your name.
[4109.84 --> 4110.18]  Amen.
[4110.18 --> 4110.28]  Amen.
[4110.28 --> 4110.32]  Amen.
[4110.32 --> 4110.34]  Amen.
[4110.34 --> 4110.36]  Amen.
[4110.36 --> 4110.40]  Amen.
[4125.76 --> 4126.78]  Please stand with us
[4126.78 --> 4127.38]  as we sing
[4127.38 --> 4128.92]  How Great is Our God.
[4128.92 --> 4130.92]  Amen.
[4158.92 --> 4160.92]  Amen.
[4188.92 --> 4190.92]  Amen.
[4218.92 --> 4220.92]  Amen.
[4248.92 --> 4250.92]  Amen.
[4278.92 --> 4280.92]  Amen.
[4308.92 --> 4310.92]  Amen.
[4338.92 --> 4340.92]  Amen.
[4340.92 --> 4346.92]  How great is our God.
[4355.92 --> 4366.02]  Before we go this morning, I just want to remind you that tonight we are having Praise by the Pond,
[4366.02 --> 4369.44]  which is just a small, informal, or maybe not small.
[4369.60 --> 4375.68]  All of you all come, and it won't be small, but it will be an informal worship evening at the Den Hans.
[4375.92 --> 4378.02]  And so we're going to gather in their backyard.
[4378.82 --> 4379.70]  They have beautiful property.
[4380.44 --> 4381.02]  There'll be snacks.
[4381.96 --> 4383.94]  You're encouraged to bring a snack to share.
[4384.04 --> 4386.08]  There'll be other refreshments provided.
[4386.60 --> 4391.84]  And bring a lawn chair, or you have to stand the entire time, which might be fine for you too.
[4392.30 --> 4395.06]  And we'll begin that at 7 p.m.
[4395.06 --> 4399.66]  And so if you would like to know more details about that, John and Pearl are in the middle.
[4399.76 --> 4400.88]  Can you guys just raise your hands?
[4401.34 --> 4401.94]  Nice and high.
[4402.02 --> 4402.44]  Very good.
[4402.54 --> 4403.68]  They can answer your questions.
[4404.04 --> 4405.68]  Or I can answer some of your questions.
[4405.78 --> 4407.48]  Or Jackie can answer some of your questions.
[4407.94 --> 4412.44]  We'd love to see you there, 7 o'clock tonight, at the Den Hans for Praise by the Pond.
[4412.44 --> 4423.40]  Also, we'd love for you to stick around now and to have time of fellowship and coffee and refreshments together following our time.
[4423.72 --> 4428.68]  Those doors will open up, and there should be goodies there, assuming everything worked according to plan.
[4428.68 --> 4433.68]  As you go then, go with God's blessing.
[4433.68 --> 4439.54]  God goes before you to lead you.
[4439.94 --> 4441.92]  God goes behind you to protect you.
[4442.28 --> 4444.36]  God goes beneath you to support you.
[4444.72 --> 4447.10]  God goes beside you to befriend you.
[4447.44 --> 4449.04]  Do not be afraid.
[4449.56 --> 4451.48]  Let the blessing of God come upon you today.
[4451.58 --> 4453.02]  Do not be afraid.
[4453.02 --> 4461.38]  But go in peace to love and proclaim the good news of our Lord Jesus.
[4462.32 --> 4462.70]  Amen.
[4463.68 --> 4467.46]  Amen.
[4467.46 --> 4468.88]  Amen.

[4500.64 --> 4507.58]  and the fellowship of God the Spirit

[4513.86 --> 4520.74]  and to Him He prays for His glorious reign
[4520.74 --> 4527.04]  from the depths of earth to the heights of heaven

[4533.32 --> 4539.80]  Christ eternal, the King of peace
[4539.80 --> 4548.40]  He may His peace surpass His understanding
[4548.40 --> 4554.70]  and His grace which pays us what we are
[4554.70 --> 4560.78]  and His fellowship of His communion
[4560.78 --> 4566.86]  make us one in spirit in God
[4566.86 --> 4572.86]  and to give Him He prays for His glorious reign
