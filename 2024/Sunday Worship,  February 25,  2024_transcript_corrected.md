[2099.64 → 2129.62] Thank you.
[2129.64 → 2159.62] Thank you.
[2159.64 → 2189.62] Thank you.
[2189.62 → 2219.60] One of the
[2219.60 → 2249.58] Cadets, what is your code.
[2249.58 → 2279.56] And I'm going to say,
[2279.56 → 2309.56] the real cadet,
[2309.56 → 2339.54] and you're in the
[2339.54 → 2346.44] Once the cadets in the shop say time is up, we get back in our age category and sing Living for Jesus.
[2347.04 → 2349.54] Sometimes we sing it louder for the parents to hear.
[2349.94 → 2351.26] That's a fun cadet night.
[2360.64 → 2363.88] We are going to sing Living for Jesus right now as a congregation.
[2363.88 → 2373.84] The way we're going to do this today is we're going to invite the cadets and all the men in cadets or not are going to stand for the first verse and chorus.
[2374.32 → 2378.32] They are going to lead us a cappella like they do in cadets every week.
[2378.98 → 2383.76] Then the rest of the congregation, you're invited to stand and join us for verses 2 and 3 as well.
[2384.62 → 2389.04] Cadets and any men who want to join them who've been in cadets in the past, please rise.
[2389.24 → 2393.00] You'll hear the piano with their note, and we will start Living for Jesus together.
[2393.88 → 2404.84] Living for Jesus, a life that is true
[2404.84 → 2411.94] Striving to please Him in all that I do
[2411.94 → 2418.72] Yielding allegiance, glad-hearted and free
[2418.72 → 2425.68] This is a pathway of blessing for me
[2425.68 → 2429.68] O Jesus, Lord and Saviour
[2429.68 → 2433.68] I give myself to Thee
[2433.68 → 2437.68] For Thou in Thine atonement
[2437.68 → 2441.68] Didst give Thyself for me
[2441.68 → 2444.64] I owe no other master
[2444.64 → 2448.64] My heart shall be Thy throne
[2448.64 → 2453.64] My life I give henceforth to live
[2453.64 → 2457.64] O Christ for Thee alone
[2457.64 → 2459.64] Please join us and rise
[2459.64 → 2464.60] Living for Jesus
[2464.60 → 2468.60] Living for Jesus who died in my place
[2468.60 → 2474.60] Bearing on Calvary my sin and disgrace
[2474.60 → 2482.60] Such love constraints me to answer His call
[2482.60 → 2483.56] For all His name and grace
[2483.56 → 2485.56] The Lord is leading
[2485.56 → 2489.56] And give Him my all
[2489.56 → 2492.56] My Jesus, Lord and Saviour
[2492.56 → 2496.56] I give myself to Thee
[2496.56 → 2499.56] For Thou in my atonement
[2499.56 → 2503.56] Didst give Thyself for me
[2503.56 → 2506.52] I owe no other master
[2506.52 → 2507.52] I owe no other master
[2507.52 → 2510.52] My heart shall be Thy throne
[2510.52 → 2514.52] My life I give henceforth to live
[2514.52 → 2519.52] O Christ for Thee alone
[2519.52 → 2528.52] Living for Jesus wherever I am
[2528.52 → 2532.48] Doing each to Thee
[2532.48 → 2536.48] In His holy name
[2536.48 → 2539.48] Seeking the lost ones
[2539.48 → 2542.48] He died to redeem
[2542.48 → 2546.48] Bringing the weary
[2546.48 → 2549.48] To find rest in Him
[2549.48 → 2553.48] O Jesus, Lord and Saviour
[2553.48 → 2556.48] I give myself to Thee
[2556.48 → 2560.44] For Thou in my atonement
[2560.44 → 2563.44] Didst give Thyself for me
[2563.44 → 2567.44] I owe no other master
[2567.44 → 2571.44] My heart shall be Thy throne
[2571.44 → 2576.44] My life I give henceforth to live
[2576.44 → 2581.44] O Christ for Thee alone
[2581.44 → 2584.00] Please be seated
[2584.00 → 2601.96] Good morning
[2601.96 → 2605.70] Good morning, my name is Brenda
[2605.70 → 2607.64] And I'm a deacon here at Emmanuel
[2607.64 → 2610.90] And we can continue our worship
[2610.90 → 2612.06] With the giving of our gifts
[2612.06 → 2614.84] And first for the budget
[2614.84 → 2617.10] That covers the administration here
[2617.10 → 2619.44] And then for cadets
[2619.44 → 2624.88] And Andrew is going to just give us a little
[2624.88 → 2626.24] Update on that
[2626.24 → 2636.20] All right, so the special offering this morning is for the cadet program
[2636.20 → 2639.94] This year for our cadet program here at Emmanuel
[2639.94 → 2641.76] We've got 28 boys registered
[2641.76 → 2646.48] With 15 of them coming from outside our church family here
[2646.48 → 2650.44] So I think a little bit less than half of them are here today
[2650.44 → 2652.14] So normally we have a much bigger group
[2652.14 → 2655.96] The goal of the cadet program is to provide Christian men
[2655.96 → 2659.84] With a structure, program, and materials that are uniquely designed
[2659.84 → 2662.64] To help boys grow spiritually in all areas of their life
[2662.64 → 2666.26] Devotional, mental, physical, and social
[2666.26 → 2671.26] Please pray for us as we help boys learn what it means to embody our motto
[2671.26 → 2672.34] Living for Jesus
[2672.34 → 2675.00] During the offering this morning
[2675.00 → 2676.88] A short slideshow we'll play
[2676.88 → 2679.86] With some of our pictures from the past year from cadets
[2679.86 → 2689.42] Bless the Lord, oh my soul
[2689.42 → 2692.50] Oh my soul
[2692.50 → 2697.46] Worship his holy name
[2697.46 → 2701.86] Sing like never before
[2701.86 → 2704.52] Oh my soul
[2704.52 → 2705.68] Oh my soul
[2705.68 → 2711.02] I worship your holy name
[2711.02 → 2718.56] The sun comes up
[2718.56 → 2722.60] It's a new day dawning
[2722.60 → 2728.32] It's time to sing your song again
[2728.32 → 2736.50] Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me
[2736.50 → 2736.52] Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me
[2736.52 → 2744.40] Let me be singing when the evening comes
[2744.40 → 2745.06] Bless the Lord, oh my soul
[2745.06 → 2750.06] Bless the Lord, oh my soul
[2750.06 → 2751.06] I worship your holy name
[2751.06 → 2757.06] I worship your holy name
[2757.06 → 2761.06] Sing like never before
[2761.06 → 2764.72] Oh my soul
[2764.72 → 2765.72] I worship your holy name
[2765.72 → 2769.72] I worship your holy name
[2769.72 → 2770.72] Your holy name
[2770.72 → 2770.96] Your holy name
[2770.96 → 2773.94] Your holy name is great
[2773.94 → 2778.10] And we're so to anger
[2778.10 → 2784.22] Your name is great, and your heart is kind
[2784.22 → 2791.48] For all your goodness I will keep on singing
[2791.48 → 2800.10] Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find
[2800.10 → 2807.62] Bless the Lord, oh my soul, oh my soul
[2807.62 → 2812.56] Worship His holy name
[2812.56 → 2820.10] Since I've never been born, oh my soul
[2820.76 → 2826.90] Worship Your holy name, bless the Lord
[2826.90 → 2834.42] Bless the Lord, oh my soul, oh my soul
[2834.42 → 2839.42] Worship His holy name
[2839.42 → 2844.26] Can't sing like never before
[2844.26 → 2852.74] Oh my soul, I'll worship Your holy name
[2856.90 → 2863.86] And on that day when my strength is failing
[2863.86 → 2869.80] The end drives near and my time has come
[2869.80 → 2876.80] Still my soul will sing Your praise all ending
[2876.80 → 2897.26] Good morning, everybody.
[2897.44 → 2903.12] Can I have the kids from preschool all the way up to grade four come up to the front?
[2903.12 → 2915.14] What do I have here, guys?
[2915.60 → 2917.64] Popcorn kernels
[2917.64 → 2919.46] The kernels, right?
[2919.70 → 2921.86] And what shape are they?
[2922.64 → 2923.20] Here
[2923.20 → 2935.76] I'm going to ask you guys, if you have to feel it, how does it feel?
[2936.90 → 2937.30] Hard
[2937.30 → 2938.10] Harder
[2938.10 → 2941.72] Crunchy
[2941.72 → 2944.68] How does it feel?
[2947.00 → 2951.52] If you had to taste the kernels, what do you think they would taste like?
[2951.52 → 2954.82] Do they taste good?
[2955.34 → 2955.92] No
[2955.92 → 2956.70] No
[2956.70 → 2961.90] What happens to the kernels when we heat them up?
[2962.14 → 2964.00] Meat, meat, meat, meat, meat
[2964.00 → 2968.56] They pop, and what does it look like?
[2972.88 → 2973.36] Popcorn
[2973.36 → 2976.32] Popcorn, and is it something to eat?
[2976.66 → 2977.04] Yeah
[2977.04 → 2979.70] Does it look nicer than a kernel?
[2980.26 → 2980.66] Yeah
[2980.66 → 2984.66] Like it looks more, I guess, beautiful, you could say, if you could say that about popcorn?
[2984.84 → 2985.30] More appetizing
[2985.30 → 2986.70] More appetizing?
[2986.92 → 2987.84] Yeah, you're right
[2987.84 → 2995.30] So the kernels, when we look at it, we can think of it as our hearts
[2995.30 → 3005.92] The kernels are hard, and they're tasteless, and you don't want to be around a person when they have a closed heart
[3005.92 → 3013.72] Because sometimes they're grumpy and grouchy, but when we heat up, or we get a seed planted in our hearts
[3013.72 → 3020.18] It comes out beautiful, and it softens our hearts, and we're at a little bit more peace
[3020.18 → 3027.06] And we're able to help other people, because other people will look at us and be like, ooh, I like that
[3027.06 → 3033.10] And we're able to help other people and tell them about what Jesus has done in our hearts
[3033.10 → 3033.66] Yeah
[3033.66 → 3040.16] So today in Children's Worship Time, we're going to talk about when we are at peace, or our hearts are softened
[3040.16 → 3043.74] We are able to help other people be at peace
[3043.74 → 3044.96] Okay?
[3045.54 → 3047.84] So can I have a person to stand up
[3047.84 → 3052.94] Look at the conversation
[3052.94 → 3055.82] And we're saying
[3055.82 → 3058.78] The Lord be with you
[3058.78 → 3060.76] And also with you
[3060.76 → 3087.00] Good morning
[3087.00 → 3088.38] My name is Rob
[3088.38 → 3089.42] I'm a member here
[3089.42 → 3091.20] And a former cadet
[3091.20 → 3100.72] As I was walking up, I wondered if perhaps that leaving for Children's Worship is good preparation for tag at cadets
[3100.72 → 3107.22] As we march through our series of Romans
[3107.22 → 3111.40] One of the things that was, for me, that was hidden in plain sight
[3111.40 → 3116.20] Was that interlude between chapters 11 and chapters 12
[3116.20 → 3120.30] And it also marks a hinge point in the book of Romans
[3120.30 → 3124.04] Between that dense theology and the practical living
[3124.04 → 3128.14] And I really appreciate that doxology sandwiched in there
[3128.14 → 3132.24] And I'd like to use that in our prayer as we pray today
[3132.24 → 3135.76] A couple of things to note from our bulletin
[3135.76 → 3139.02] Ellen White is in the hospital with a broken hip
[3139.02 → 3142.48] And also, I understand it is her birthday today
[3142.48 → 3143.52] She is 76
[3143.52 → 3148.78] We also want to pray for our Mexico missions team
[3148.78 → 3151.26] With their upcoming trip, of course
[3151.26 → 3154.58] And the dinner, which is on the 2nd
[3154.58 → 3156.06] Do I have that correct?
[3156.06 → 3156.62] Okay
[3156.62 → 3163.56] And also, I thought it would be interesting to look at our bulletin from a year ago
[3163.56 → 3170.04] And in that bulletin, we noted that Leanne's father had passed away
[3170.04 → 3174.04] CY Kisser was starting his treatments
[3174.04 → 3178.66] And Jackie Birken pass was in the last days of her life
[3178.66 → 3182.56] These things are no longer on our current list
[3182.56 → 3184.18] But they're not forgotten
[3184.18 → 3187.40] And we remember these families, too, in their grief
[3187.40 → 3191.76] Let's turn together in prayer
[3191.76 → 3197.60] Oh, how great are God's riches in wisdom and knowledge
[3197.60 → 3200.76] How impossible it is for us to understand
[3200.76 → 3203.46] His decisions and His ways
[3203.46 → 3206.04] Who can know the Lord's thoughts?
[3206.68 → 3208.64] Who knows enough to give Him advice?
[3209.32 → 3212.90] And who has given Him so much that He needs to pay it back?
[3213.72 → 3216.66] For everything comes from Him and exists by His power
[3216.66 → 3218.58] And is intended for His glory
[3218.58 → 3221.02] All glory to Him forever
[3221.02 → 3225.30] We begin and end with these words to praise you
[3225.30 → 3227.92] And to remind ourselves of who you are
[3227.92 → 3230.64] How vast the love of Christ
[3230.64 → 3233.88] May we as your church, through all times and places
[3233.88 → 3239.72] With the cadets, grasp how wide, how long, how high, how deep
[3239.72 → 3242.34] And that we may know it, too
[3242.34 → 3246.82] Without you, assuming we could actually exist without you
[3246.82 → 3248.76] How much worse things would be
[3248.76 → 3250.66] All glory to you forever
[3250.66 → 3254.32] And yet, we seek our own glory
[3254.32 → 3255.28] Our own knowledge
[3255.28 → 3258.60] Sometimes we tend to preserve what we have
[3258.60 → 3261.50] Rather than giving to you what is yours
[3261.50 → 3264.04] Forgive us, Lord, as individuals
[3264.04 → 3265.34] For the endless times
[3265.34 → 3267.92] We've done this throughout this past week
[3267.92 → 3270.02] Forgive us as families
[3270.02 → 3273.04] For the repeated times that we've put our family first
[3273.04 → 3275.90] Forgive us, Lord, as our church family
[3275.90 → 3278.44] For the repeated times we've put ourselves first
[3278.44 → 3282.16] Through our wrong, may we see your right
[3282.16 → 3284.92] We have much to give thanks
[3284.92 → 3287.18] We thank you for all that comes from you
[3287.18 → 3288.82] For the material blessings
[3288.82 → 3291.26] For things, activities that we can enjoy
[3291.26 → 3294.26] For the creativity that you've given us
[3294.26 → 3296.94] Just in our midst here, we have the artist
[3296.94 → 3299.70] The academic, the quilter, the athlete, the fixer
[3299.70 → 3302.18] May those bring you glory, too
[3302.18 → 3305.00] Thank you for those in our midst
[3305.00 → 3306.80] Who have that gift of serving
[3306.80 → 3308.86] Of teaching, of encouragement
[3308.86 → 3310.94] Of mercy, of leadership
[3310.94 → 3313.26] Of giving, of hospitality
[3313.26 → 3317.44] Thank you for the technology we live in this age
[3317.44 → 3319.42] For the vastness of the internet
[3319.42 → 3321.86] Which is just a mere speck of information
[3321.86 → 3323.26] In contrast to you
[3323.26 → 3326.58] For podcasts that can engage our mind
[3326.58 → 3328.84] Which is just a mere start of
[3328.84 → 3331.58] In comparison to your knowledge
[3331.58 → 3333.68] For the social media
[3333.68 → 3335.10] That connects us in ways
[3335.10 → 3336.46] It's just a mere shadow
[3336.46 → 3338.32] Of the relationship we can have in you
[3338.32 → 3341.56] We ask for your continued providence
[3341.56 → 3343.24] You do immeasurably more
[3343.24 → 3344.90] Than we ask or imagine
[3344.90 → 3347.72] Father, we think of those things
[3347.72 → 3348.96] That we highlight
[3348.96 → 3351.78] In our bulletin
[3351.78 → 3353.12] We think of Ellen White
[3353.12 → 3354.44] In the hospital, Lord
[3354.44 → 3355.92] We pray that you'll give her healing
[3355.92 → 3359.40] And thank you for the years of her life
[3359.40 → 3361.32] That she could celebrate a birthday today
[3361.32 → 3365.02] Father, we pray for the individuals
[3365.02 → 3366.66] And families who've been impacted
[3366.66 → 3369.92] By people passing away
[3369.92 → 3373.44] We pray that even though
[3373.44 → 3374.84] We don't mention them by week
[3374.84 → 3379.10] That you will continue to grant them peace
[3379.10 → 3382.36] And as they go through that grieving process
[3382.36 → 3383.62] Remember them
[3383.62 → 3387.70] Father, we pray for each of us
[3387.70 → 3390.64] As we go through our own particular life trials
[3390.64 → 3391.86] Whatever they may be
[3391.86 → 3394.08] And we pray that we will be able to
[3394.08 → 3395.42] To give them over to you
[3395.42 → 3396.66] And through our pain
[3396.66 → 3398.16] That we might see you clearly
[3398.16 → 3401.28] We think also of the Mexico team
[3401.28 → 3402.90] We thank you for dinner upcoming
[3402.90 → 3405.58] We pray that they will be able to prepare well
[3405.58 → 3407.04] We pray for Brandon
[3407.04 → 3408.32] As he leads this trip
[3408.32 → 3410.20] Give him the wisdom and grace
[3410.20 → 3413.36] Even just giving him time and space
[3413.36 → 3414.22] To be able to prepare
[3414.22 → 3415.98] And spend time with his family
[3415.98 → 3419.80] We pray that the team will be able to make good connections there
[3419.80 → 3422.76] And reconnect with people from before
[3422.76 → 3426.02] In Mexico, we think of Jody and Ariel
[3426.02 → 3429.12] As they minister there
[3429.12 → 3430.28] We pray for the men
[3430.28 → 3432.22] That come to their addiction recovery home
[3432.22 → 3434.82] Sometimes over and over again
[3434.82 → 3437.14] Perhaps not a subtle reminder
[3437.14 → 3439.16] Of our own addictions to sin
[3439.16 → 3441.42] And the grace that you lavish on us
[3441.42 → 3442.76] Over and over again
[3442.76 → 3445.68] We thank you for all the ministries
[3445.68 → 3447.48] And the teams of this church
[3447.48 → 3449.96] Today we highlight the cadet program
[3449.96 → 3451.50] We pray that you bless the cadets
[3451.50 → 3452.50] And their leaders
[3452.50 → 3453.58] Bless their activities
[3453.58 → 3455.56] Whether that be racing cub cars
[3455.56 → 3457.28] Or spending time in devotions
[3457.28 → 3458.54] Or just hanging out
[3458.54 → 3462.16] We ask that in our time here today
[3462.16 → 3463.28] That you will be praised
[3463.28 → 3465.92] And that we will be filled with your spirit
[3465.92 → 3468.26] May we dig into your word today
[3468.26 → 3469.14] This week
[3469.14 → 3471.18] And this week
[3471.18 → 3473.44] And reflect on the message
[3473.44 → 3475.18] We hear this morning from Ephesians
[3475.18 → 3478.48] Oh how great are God's riches
[3478.48 → 3480.20] In wisdom
[3480.20 → 3481.44] In knowledge
[3481.44 → 3482.90] How impossible it is
[3482.90 → 3484.76] For us to understand his decisions
[3484.76 → 3485.72] And his ways
[3485.72 → 3488.14] For who can know
[3488.14 → 3489.18] The Lord's thoughts
[3489.18 → 3490.52] Who knows enough
[3490.52 → 3491.54] To give him advice
[3491.54 → 3493.64] And who has given him
[3493.64 → 3494.44] So much
[3494.44 → 3496.10] That he needs to pay it back
[3496.10 → 3498.72] For everything comes from him
[3498.72 → 3500.12] And exists by his power
[3500.12 → 3501.28] And is intended
[3501.28 → 3502.56] For his glory
[3502.56 → 3504.20] All glory to him
[3504.20 → 3505.16] Forever
[3505.16 → 3505.76] Amen
[3505.76 → 3506.32] Amen
[3506.32 → 3514.50] Thanks Rob
[3514.50 → 3520.20] We're gonna
[3520.20 → 3522.56] Read together
[3522.56 → 3524.14] I'm going to let you find it
[3524.14 → 3524.60] There
[3524.60 → 3525.24] Yeah
[3525.24 → 3526.06] There
[3526.06 → 3527.88] We're going to read together
[3527.88 → 3529.34] From Ephesians 3
[3529.34 → 3531.66] It's going to be read by a couple cadets
[3531.66 → 3532.26] And so
[3532.26 → 3533.38] I invite you to
[3533.38 → 3534.66] Find a Bible
[3534.66 → 3535.76] Open it up
[3535.76 → 3537.22] Turn to Ephesians 3
[3537.22 → 3538.76] Our first time through
[3538.76 → 3540.56] Will be on the screen behind us
[3540.56 → 3542.40] If you
[3542.40 → 3544.18] Are looking for Bibles
[3544.18 → 3545.42] There's some at the back there
[3545.42 → 3546.82] We can invite you to grab one of those
[3546.82 → 3548.78] Or you can turn your device on
[3548.78 → 3549.66] And find it there
[3549.66 → 3551.00] Boys
[3551.00 → 3551.56] Go ahead
[3551.56 → 3553.18] Reading this morning
[3553.18 → 3554.44] Comes from Ephesians 3
[3554.44 → 3555.80] Verses 14 to 21
[3555.80 → 3557.54] My prayer for the Ephesians
[3557.54 → 3558.62] For this reason
[3558.62 → 3559.82] I kneel before the Father
[3559.82 → 3561.10] From whom every family
[3561.10 → 3561.66] In heaven
[3561.66 → 3562.54] On earth
[3562.54 → 3563.50] Devices its name
[3563.50 → 3565.28] I pray that out of
[3565.28 → 3566.28] His glorious riches
[3566.28 → 3567.50] He may strengthen you
[3567.50 → 3568.04] With power
[3568.04 → 3569.06] Through his spirit
[3569.06 → 3569.94] In your inner being
[3569.94 → 3571.44] So that Christ
[3571.44 → 3572.40] May dwell in your hearts
[3572.40 → 3572.98] Through faith
[3572.98 → 3576.78] And I pray that
[3576.78 → 3577.90] You being rooted
[3577.90 → 3578.64] And established
[3578.64 → 3579.36] In love
[3579.36 → 3580.28] May have power
[3580.28 → 3581.34] Together with all
[3581.34 → 3582.56] The Lord's holy people
[3582.56 → 3583.84] To grasp how
[3583.84 → 3585.02] Wide and long
[3585.02 → 3586.18] And high and deep
[3586.18 → 3587.42] Is the love of Christ
[3587.42 → 3588.66] And to know
[3588.66 → 3589.52] This love
[3589.52 → 3590.98] That surpasses knowledge
[3590.98 → 3592.76] That you may be filled
[3592.76 → 3593.52] To the measure
[3593.52 → 3594.50] Of all the fullness
[3594.50 → 3595.16] Of God
[3595.16 → 3596.46] Now to him
[3596.46 → 3597.66] Who is able to do
[3597.66 → 3598.86] Immeasurably more
[3598.86 → 3599.98] Than all we ask
[3599.98 → 3600.60] Or imagine
[3600.60 → 3602.18] According to his power
[3602.18 → 3603.20] That is at work
[3603.20 → 3603.94] Within us
[3603.94 → 3605.46] To him be glory
[3605.46 → 3606.10] In the church
[3606.10 → 3607.14] And in Christ Jesus
[3607.14 → 3608.52] Throughout all generations
[3608.52 → 3609.80] Forever and ever
[3609.80 → 3610.48] Amen
[3610.48 → 3612.04] Amen
[3612.04 → 3613.60] The word of the Lord
[3613.60 → 3613.96] Amen
[3613.96 → 3614.02] Amen
[3614.02 → 3614.52] Amen
[3614.52 → 3615.02] Amen
[3615.02 → 3616.02] Amen
[3616.02 → 3617.02] Amen
[3617.02 → 3617.40] Amen
[3617.40 → 3624.18] As Austin
[3624.18 → 3625.30] Was up here earlier
[3625.30 → 3625.96] Talking about
[3625.96 → 3627.12] A typical night
[3627.12 → 3627.70] At cadets
[3627.70 → 3628.66] I was thinking back
[3628.66 → 3629.14] To when
[3629.14 → 3630.36] I was a boy
[3630.36 → 3631.20] When I was your age
[3631.20 → 3632.26] I was also in
[3632.26 → 3633.74] A cadet program
[3633.74 → 3635.46] And I have to say
[3635.46 → 3636.64] You kids must be better
[3636.64 → 3637.32] Than we were
[3637.32 → 3637.90] Back then
[3637.90 → 3639.48] Because we didn't play
[3639.48 → 3640.40] Hide and seek
[3640.40 → 3641.06] Or tag
[3641.06 → 3642.64] We played
[3642.64 → 3643.28] Wrestle
[3643.28 → 3644.22] With the largest
[3644.22 → 3644.86] Counsellor
[3644.86 → 3646.86] And our largest
[3646.86 → 3647.38] Counsellor
[3647.38 → 3647.80] Was like
[3647.80 → 3648.48] Counsellor
[3648.48 → 3649.24] Alvin
[3649.24 → 3650.18] If he had
[3650.18 → 3650.60] Eaten
[3650.60 → 3651.04] Another
[3651.04 → 3651.64] Counsellor
[3651.64 → 3652.00] Alvin
[3652.00 → 3655.42] And so
[3655.42 → 3656.54] If someone
[3656.54 → 3657.06] Went home
[3657.06 → 3657.70] Without a broken
[3657.70 → 3658.08] Bone
[3658.08 → 3659.18] It was a good
[3659.18 → 3659.98] Night at cadets
[3659.98 → 3662.58] Also
[3662.58 → 3663.76] Mindful of the fact
[3663.76 → 3664.38] That song
[3664.38 → 3665.20] Living for Jesus
[3665.20 → 3666.46] Hasn't changed
[3666.46 → 3667.30] In 40 years
[3667.30 → 3668.60] Still sounds
[3668.60 → 3669.26] As broken
[3669.26 → 3670.72] And the like
[3670.72 → 3671.42] As we go
[3671.42 → 3673.20] But it's such
[3673.20 → 3673.78] A beautiful
[3673.78 → 3674.98] And powerful message
[3674.98 → 3676.66] And so my prayer
[3676.66 → 3677.38] For you guys
[3677.38 → 3678.02] This morning
[3678.02 → 3678.76] And for you
[3678.76 → 3680.02] All year long
[3680.02 → 3681.42] Is that you
[3681.42 → 3682.38] Would experience
[3682.38 → 3683.16] What it means
[3683.16 → 3684.14] To live for Jesus
[3684.14 → 3685.74] By experiencing
[3685.74 → 3687.04] Deeply and truly
[3687.04 → 3688.60] The love of Jesus
[3688.60 → 3689.72] For you
[3689.72 → 3691.54] That's kind of
[3691.54 → 3692.20] The focus of our
[3692.20 → 3692.92] Text this morning
[3692.92 → 3694.68] When you go home
[3694.68 → 3695.04] Today
[3695.04 → 3696.28] When you leave here
[3696.28 → 3697.62] And you're having
[3697.62 → 3698.48] Lunch with grandma
[3698.48 → 3699.64] And she asks
[3699.64 → 3700.54] What was church about
[3700.54 → 3702.26] This is what you can say
[3702.26 → 3705.64] Jesus gives me faith
[3705.64 → 3706.70] To be rooted
[3706.70 → 3707.42] And grounded
[3707.42 → 3708.42] In his love
[3708.42 → 3709.44] No matter what
[3709.44 → 3713.24] That's what this
[3713.24 → 3713.94] Text is about
[3713.94 → 3714.80] That's what it means
[3714.80 → 3716.10] To be rooted
[3716.10 → 3717.50] And grounded
[3717.50 → 3718.72] And so that's
[3718.72 → 3719.18] What we're going to
[3719.18 → 3720.88] Explore with you guys
[3720.88 → 3721.88] This morning
[3721.88 → 3723.64] Now in this text
[3723.64 → 3725.62] Paul is praying
[3725.62 → 3728.06] For the young believers
[3728.06 → 3729.06] At a church
[3729.06 → 3729.74] In a city
[3729.74 → 3731.18] Called Ephesus
[3731.18 → 3732.16] We have a little map
[3732.16 → 3732.92] I think that we can
[3732.92 → 3733.60] Throw up there
[3733.60 → 3736.00] Now Paul probably
[3736.00 → 3736.90] Wrote this letter
[3736.90 → 3738.04] Sometime around
[3738.04 → 3739.04] A.D. 62
[3739.04 → 3742.16] He first visited
[3742.16 → 3742.66] Ephesus
[3742.66 → 3744.08] In A.D. 52
[3744.08 → 3745.38] On what we call
[3745.38 → 3747.16] His second missionary journey
[3747.16 → 3748.40] And so he journeyed
[3748.40 → 3749.48] Through the area
[3749.48 → 3750.26] And then he comes
[3750.26 → 3751.40] Back to Ephesus
[3751.40 → 3752.18] And he actually lives
[3752.18 → 3752.90] There for two
[3752.90 → 3753.84] Or three years
[3753.84 → 3755.60] Between A.D. 54
[3755.60 → 3757.18] To 56
[3757.18 → 3759.50] But what that means
[3759.50 → 3760.36] When Paul writes
[3760.36 → 3760.92] This letter
[3760.92 → 3761.80] In A.D. 62
[3761.80 → 3763.08] Is that the church
[3763.08 → 3765.04] Is only ten years old
[3765.04 → 3767.62] Which I think
[3767.62 → 3768.12] Is interesting
[3768.12 → 3769.28] Because some of you
[3769.28 → 3771.36] Are only ten years old
[3771.36 → 3773.02] Or close to ten
[3773.02 → 3774.04] Years old
[3774.04 → 3776.24] And what he wants
[3776.24 → 3777.38] Them to understand
[3777.38 → 3778.28] And what he wants
[3778.28 → 3779.08] Us to see
[3779.08 → 3779.92] And to know
[3779.92 → 3781.12] And so then
[3781.12 → 3782.52] What he prays for
[3782.52 → 3783.50] For this church
[3783.50 → 3784.34] And for you
[3784.34 → 3785.46] Continuing through
[3785.46 → 3786.62] The generations of faith
[3786.62 → 3787.88] Is that
[3787.88 → 3788.72] What did we read?
[3788.72 → 3792.10] God's glorious riches
[3792.10 → 3793.96] May strengthen you
[3793.96 → 3794.80] With power
[3794.80 → 3795.94] Through his spirit
[3795.94 → 3797.56] In your inner being
[3797.56 → 3800.12] Now the first thing
[3800.12 → 3800.86] I want you to see
[3800.86 → 3802.02] Is just what
[3802.02 → 3803.62] God's glorious riches
[3803.62 → 3804.96] Are
[3804.96 → 3807.04] Now Paul uses
[3807.04 → 3807.98] This same phrase
[3807.98 → 3808.58] Actually
[3808.58 → 3809.84] In Colossians 1
[3809.84 → 3810.68] Verse 27
[3810.68 → 3811.64] And I think
[3811.64 → 3812.48] That helps us see
[3812.48 → 3813.18] More clearly
[3813.18 → 3813.82] He says
[3813.82 → 3815.18] To them
[3815.18 → 3816.96] That is the Lord's people
[3816.96 → 3818.60] God has chosen
[3818.60 → 3819.68] To make known
[3819.68 → 3820.76] Among the Gentiles
[3820.76 → 3821.52] Now Gentiles
[3821.52 → 3823.00] Is the Jewish way
[3823.00 → 3823.56] Of saying
[3823.56 → 3824.44] Everybody else
[3824.44 → 3825.30] Who isn't Jewish
[3825.30 → 3826.98] The glorious riches
[3826.98 → 3829.30] Riches of this mystery
[3829.30 → 3830.86] And there's that phrase again
[3830.86 → 3832.32] The glorious riches
[3832.32 → 3834.80] Which is Christ
[3834.80 → 3836.42] In you
[3836.42 → 3837.98] The hope of glory
[3837.98 → 3840.10] Alright one more time
[3840.10 → 3841.12] To them
[3841.12 → 3841.98] God has chosen
[3841.98 → 3842.72] To make known
[3842.72 → 3843.62] Among the Gentiles
[3843.62 → 3844.74] The glorious riches
[3844.74 → 3845.80] Of this mystery
[3845.80 → 3846.84] Which is Christ
[3846.84 → 3848.02] In you
[3848.02 → 3849.06] The hope
[3849.06 → 3850.12] Of glory
[3850.12 → 3851.82] And so in Ephesians
[3851.82 → 3853.16] When Paul prays
[3853.16 → 3854.76] That God's glorious riches
[3854.76 → 3856.02] Might strengthen you
[3856.02 → 3856.90] With his power
[3856.90 → 3858.66] And through his spirit
[3858.66 → 3859.68] In your inner being
[3859.68 → 3862.62] Part of what he means there
[3862.62 → 3863.26] Is that
[3863.26 → 3864.34] That Christ
[3864.34 → 3865.18] Lives
[3865.18 → 3866.02] In you
[3866.02 → 3868.04] Right
[3868.04 → 3868.68] That it would be
[3868.68 → 3870.46] The presence of Christ
[3870.46 → 3871.22] In you
[3871.22 → 3872.46] That strengthens
[3872.46 → 3873.08] You
[3873.08 → 3874.38] And that by his spirit
[3874.38 → 3876.14] In your inner being
[3876.14 → 3877.64] That's deep in your heart
[3877.64 → 3877.96] Right
[3877.96 → 3878.68] Into the core
[3878.68 → 3879.52] Of who you are
[3879.52 → 3880.56] You know
[3880.56 → 3881.78] His nearness
[3881.78 → 3884.38] So even as close
[3884.38 → 3885.70] As the person next to you
[3885.70 → 3886.30] Is sitting
[3886.30 → 3888.02] Jesus is closer
[3888.02 → 3889.88] Now
[3889.88 → 3892.50] I actually can't
[3892.50 → 3893.20] State
[3893.20 → 3894.32] Or overstate
[3894.32 → 3895.40] How cool
[3895.40 → 3896.58] This actually is
[3896.58 → 3897.52] Right
[3897.52 → 3898.54] What it means
[3898.54 → 3899.24] To be Christian
[3899.24 → 3900.10] Is to live
[3900.10 → 3900.96] With Jesus
[3900.96 → 3902.16] To live in a deep
[3902.16 → 3902.92] And real
[3902.92 → 3904.42] Relationship to him
[3904.42 → 3905.14] Because he
[3905.14 → 3906.26] By the spirit
[3906.26 → 3907.72] Is living in you
[3907.72 → 3908.34] And with you
[3908.34 → 3910.10] And because by the spirit
[3910.10 → 3911.52] You are being transformed
[3911.52 → 3913.60] Into his image
[3913.60 → 3915.40] Because by the spirit
[3915.40 → 3916.08] You are becoming
[3916.08 → 3917.46] Like him
[3917.46 → 3918.32] Right
[3918.32 → 3919.56] Because of his glorious
[3919.56 → 3920.30] Riches
[3920.30 → 3921.28] Because of his grace
[3921.28 → 3922.04] To those of us
[3922.04 → 3922.84] Who believe
[3922.84 → 3924.58] When God looks at you
[3924.58 → 3927.24] He sees Jesus
[3927.24 → 3929.90] And that's amazing
[3929.90 → 3931.56] Right
[3931.56 → 3932.72] That's an invitation
[3932.72 → 3934.02] Into the coolest
[3934.02 → 3934.98] And deepest
[3934.98 → 3936.66] And most awesome
[3936.66 → 3937.42] Relationship
[3937.42 → 3938.20] That has existed
[3938.20 → 3939.54] From eternity past
[3939.54 → 3940.44] In God the Father
[3940.44 → 3942.04] Son and Holy Spirit
[3942.04 → 3942.56] You
[3942.56 → 3944.02] Get to be part of that
[3944.02 → 3945.24] We
[3945.24 → 3946.40] By grace
[3946.40 → 3947.00] Through faith
[3947.00 → 3948.30] Get to be part of that
[3948.30 → 3950.64] And that is amazing
[3950.64 → 3952.96] And so
[3952.96 → 3955.22] It's a tragedy
[3955.22 → 3956.50] If
[3956.50 → 3957.30] If
[3957.30 → 3959.00] All you think
[3959.00 → 3959.86] Being a Christian
[3959.86 → 3960.34] Means
[3960.34 → 3961.22] Going to church
[3961.22 → 3961.80] On Sunday
[3961.80 → 3962.66] And listening
[3962.66 → 3963.60] To some dusty
[3963.60 → 3964.52] Old pastor
[3964.52 → 3965.30] Talk about some
[3965.30 → 3965.82] Dusty
[3965.82 → 3966.68] Old book
[3966.68 → 3968.32] Right
[3968.32 → 3968.94] If you think
[3968.94 → 3969.62] Being a Christian
[3969.62 → 3971.06] Means not doing
[3971.06 → 3971.62] The things
[3971.62 → 3972.10] That your
[3972.10 → 3972.92] Non-churchgoing
[3972.92 → 3973.28] Friends
[3973.28 → 3973.98] Get to do
[3973.98 → 3976.52] That's
[3976.52 → 3977.76] Heartbreaking
[3977.76 → 3979.02] Because you
[3979.02 → 3980.02] Miss this truth
[3980.02 → 3981.04] Right
[3981.04 → 3981.36] You're going to
[3981.36 → 3981.86] Miss on the
[3981.86 → 3982.70] Most amazing
[3982.70 → 3983.60] Thing that God
[3983.60 → 3984.32] Has prepared
[3984.32 → 3985.06] For you
[3985.06 → 3986.00] For you guys
[3986.00 → 3987.24] Right
[3987.24 → 3988.08] Being a Christian
[3988.08 → 3989.28] Means being
[3989.28 → 3990.20] In a relationship
[3990.20 → 3990.72] To God
[3990.72 → 3991.78] Because of Jesus
[3991.78 → 3992.92] It means trusting
[3992.92 → 3993.88] God more
[3993.88 → 3994.66] Than you trust
[3994.66 → 3995.14] Yourself
[3995.14 → 3996.30] It means being
[3996.30 → 3997.10] More loved
[3997.10 → 3997.58] Than you could
[3997.58 → 3998.86] Ever imagine
[3998.86 → 3999.60] Possible
[3999.60 → 4001.98] And I want
[4001.98 → 4002.80] That for you guys
[4002.80 → 4004.82] And I can say
[4004.82 → 4005.52] With confidence
[4005.52 → 4006.28] Your counsellors
[4006.28 → 4007.92] Want that for you guys
[4007.92 → 4009.00] Your parents
[4009.00 → 4010.24] Want that for you guys
[4010.24 → 4010.84] Everyone here
[4010.84 → 4011.38] In this church
[4011.38 → 4012.02] Wants that
[4012.02 → 4013.00] For you guys
[4013.00 → 4015.02] And the way
[4015.02 → 4016.00] You get that
[4016.00 → 4018.00] Is the second thing
[4018.00 → 4018.80] That Paul prays for
[4018.80 → 4020.62] In verse 17
[4020.62 → 4021.46] We continue
[4021.46 → 4021.86] He says
[4021.86 → 4023.72] I pray that Christ
[4023.72 → 4024.50] May dwell
[4024.50 → 4025.94] In your hearts
[4025.94 → 4027.86] Through faith
[4027.86 → 4029.88] Faith
[4029.88 → 4032.24] Is the answer
[4032.24 → 4033.78] Faith
[4033.78 → 4035.04] Is how you
[4035.04 → 4035.74] Are brought
[4035.74 → 4036.96] Into union
[4036.96 → 4037.56] With Jesus
[4037.56 → 4038.50] And into relationship
[4038.50 → 4038.90] With God
[4038.90 → 4039.76] Faith
[4039.76 → 4041.80] Means believing
[4041.80 → 4043.00] It means trusting
[4043.00 → 4044.52] Faith is assurance
[4044.52 → 4045.32] When you doubt
[4045.32 → 4046.52] Faith is worship
[4046.52 → 4047.58] When you have questions
[4047.58 → 4048.90] Faith is learning
[4048.90 → 4050.28] The truth of who God is
[4050.28 → 4051.88] And faith is trusting
[4051.88 → 4052.86] In the promises
[4052.86 → 4054.12] That you learn about
[4054.12 → 4056.12] And so
[4056.12 → 4057.16] Simultaneously
[4057.16 → 4058.08] For us
[4058.08 → 4059.46] Faith is something
[4059.46 → 4060.90] That you receive
[4060.90 → 4062.68] Faith is something
[4062.68 → 4063.60] You believe
[4063.60 → 4064.92] And faith
[4064.92 → 4066.38] Then after those
[4066.38 → 4067.00] Two things
[4067.00 → 4067.70] Is something
[4067.70 → 4068.70] You achieve
[4068.70 → 4070.70] Faith is something
[4070.70 → 4071.74] You receive
[4071.74 → 4072.84] And believe
[4072.84 → 4074.08] And then after that
[4074.08 → 4075.48] Something you achieve
[4075.48 → 4077.24] So first
[4077.24 → 4077.98] Quickly
[4077.98 → 4079.80] Faith is something
[4079.80 → 4081.34] You receive
[4081.34 → 4084.08] Earlier in Paul's
[4084.08 → 4084.46] Letter
[4084.46 → 4085.80] To the church
[4085.80 → 4087.12] In Ephesus
[4087.12 → 4088.22] He writes
[4088.22 → 4089.72] In chapter 2
[4089.72 → 4090.24] Verse 8
[4090.24 → 4091.90] For it is by grace
[4091.90 → 4093.08] You have been saved
[4093.08 → 4094.06] Through faith
[4094.06 → 4095.12] And this is not
[4095.12 → 4096.00] From yourselves
[4096.00 → 4097.60] It is the gift
[4097.60 → 4099.32] Of God
[4099.32 → 4101.40] Faith is a gift
[4101.40 → 4103.24] Faith is something
[4103.24 → 4104.72] That God gives you
[4104.72 → 4106.50] And in his giving you faith
[4106.50 → 4107.62] Because of his grace
[4107.62 → 4108.66] You are united
[4108.66 → 4109.56] To Christ
[4109.56 → 4110.48] Right
[4110.48 → 4111.68] Faith is something
[4111.68 → 4112.60] You receive
[4112.60 → 4115.74] But faith is also
[4115.74 → 4117.20] Something you believe
[4117.20 → 4119.62] That in Romans 10
[4119.62 → 4121.06] You can read
[4121.06 → 4124.00] For it is with your heart
[4124.00 → 4124.68] That you believe
[4124.68 → 4125.58] And are justified
[4125.58 → 4127.08] And it is with your mouth
[4127.08 → 4128.24] That you profess
[4128.24 → 4129.14] Your faith
[4129.14 → 4130.38] And are saved
[4130.38 → 4133.16] In order to profess
[4133.16 → 4133.66] Your faith
[4133.66 → 4134.54] In order to say
[4134.54 → 4135.90] This is what I believe
[4135.90 → 4137.96] There has to be something
[4137.96 → 4138.90] You can say
[4138.90 → 4140.10] This is what I believe
[4140.10 → 4141.28] Right
[4141.28 → 4142.60] There has to be a set
[4142.60 → 4143.88] Of ideas
[4143.88 → 4145.96] Or there is some content
[4145.96 → 4146.68] There
[4146.68 → 4148.20] There is a doctrine
[4148.20 → 4149.04] There is the word
[4149.04 → 4149.50] That we use
[4149.50 → 4150.38] In the church
[4150.38 → 4150.80] Right
[4150.80 → 4151.52] That tells you
[4151.52 → 4152.48] About who you are
[4152.48 → 4153.90] That tells you
[4153.90 → 4154.86] About the world
[4154.86 → 4155.84] That God has created
[4155.84 → 4156.78] And what is happening
[4156.78 → 4157.10] In it
[4157.10 → 4157.74] And what is wrong
[4157.74 → 4158.06] With it
[4158.06 → 4158.82] That tells you
[4158.82 → 4160.16] About who God is
[4160.16 → 4161.56] And what he has done
[4161.56 → 4163.20] To save us
[4163.20 → 4164.54] From the brokenness
[4164.54 → 4165.64] That is in the world
[4165.64 → 4166.30] That we are in
[4166.30 → 4167.16] Right
[4167.16 → 4168.28] Faith as something
[4168.28 → 4169.12] You believe
[4169.12 → 4170.44] Means that there is
[4170.44 → 4171.02] Content
[4171.02 → 4172.04] Content to it
[4172.04 → 4173.18] That we can learn
[4173.18 → 4174.58] And that we can grow in
[4174.58 → 4176.14] In fact
[4176.14 → 4178.08] The Bible says
[4178.08 → 4179.96] That a good minister
[4179.96 → 4181.40] Of Christ Jesus
[4181.40 → 4182.50] Is nourished
[4182.50 → 4183.48] On the truths
[4183.48 → 4184.26] Of the faith
[4184.26 → 4185.94] And of the good teaching
[4185.94 → 4187.20] That you have followed
[4187.20 → 4189.72] And so there is something there
[4189.72 → 4190.84] That fills you
[4190.84 → 4192.24] And feeds you
[4192.24 → 4194.14] Faith
[4194.14 → 4195.86] Is something you receive
[4195.86 → 4197.48] And faith
[4197.48 → 4199.80] Is something you believe
[4199.80 → 4202.42] And then
[4202.42 → 4203.94] After receiving
[4203.94 → 4205.30] And believing
[4205.30 → 4207.04] Faith becomes
[4207.04 → 4208.00] Something you
[4208.00 → 4209.10] Achieve
[4209.10 → 4210.48] And what I mean by that
[4210.48 → 4211.38] Is faith becomes
[4211.38 → 4212.36] Something you do
[4212.36 → 4214.18] Right
[4214.18 → 4214.82] James 2
[4214.82 → 4215.82] Says
[4215.82 → 4217.70] Faith by itself
[4217.70 → 4218.66] Is not
[4218.66 → 4219.62] If it is not
[4219.62 → 4220.58] Accompanied by action
[4220.58 → 4221.24] Is dead
[4221.24 → 4223.12] I will show you
[4223.12 → 4223.84] My faith
[4223.84 → 4224.84] By my deeds
[4224.84 → 4226.46] The Bible
[4226.46 → 4227.06] Talks about
[4227.06 → 4227.74] In different places
[4227.74 → 4228.96] The obedience
[4228.96 → 4230.16] That comes from
[4230.16 → 4230.56] Faith
[4230.56 → 4232.82] But
[4232.82 → 4233.80] It is really important
[4233.80 → 4234.60] For you guys to hear
[4234.60 → 4235.90] That is the order
[4235.90 → 4237.38] Right
[4237.38 → 4237.86] Faith
[4237.86 → 4238.68] First
[4238.68 → 4239.08] That is
[4239.08 → 4239.68] The
[4239.68 → 4242.28] Receiving
[4242.28 → 4243.24] And believing
[4243.24 → 4244.08] First
[4244.08 → 4245.34] Obedience
[4245.34 → 4246.42] Follows
[4246.42 → 4248.18] And that is an important
[4248.18 → 4249.30] Distinction to keep
[4249.30 → 4249.76] In our minds
[4249.76 → 4250.56] Because sometimes
[4250.56 → 4252.32] We expect the order
[4252.32 → 4253.56] To be the other way around
[4253.56 → 4255.50] We expect obedience
[4255.50 → 4256.78] Before faith
[4256.78 → 4257.28] Has been
[4257.28 → 4257.84] Has been
[4257.84 → 4258.42] Manifest
[4258.42 → 4258.60] Or
[4258.60 → 4259.88] Before faith
[4259.88 → 4260.54] Has been given
[4260.54 → 4261.92] So
[4261.92 → 4262.84] This actually
[4262.84 → 4263.64] Maybe is a word
[4263.64 → 4264.34] For you parents
[4264.34 → 4265.54] Out there
[4265.54 → 4268.72] If you
[4268.72 → 4269.56] Want
[4269.56 → 4270.64] Obedience
[4270.64 → 4271.34] To God
[4271.34 → 4272.10] In your kids
[4272.10 → 4272.70] Lives
[4272.70 → 4274.92] Don't start
[4274.92 → 4275.60] By talking to them
[4275.60 → 4276.22] About rules
[4276.22 → 4278.54] Talk to them
[4278.54 → 4279.16] About faith
[4279.16 → 4280.78] Right
[4280.78 → 4281.32] If you're going to
[4281.32 → 4282.40] Expect the kind
[4282.40 → 4283.54] Of obedience
[4283.54 → 4285.08] To Christ
[4285.08 → 4285.88] Called for
[4285.88 → 4286.64] In the Bible
[4286.64 → 4287.38] Then
[4287.38 → 4289.28] Like my prayer
[4289.28 → 4289.74] Is that
[4289.74 → 4290.52] You would be
[4290.52 → 4291.50] Showing them
[4291.50 → 4292.92] The vitality
[4292.92 → 4293.74] Of a faith
[4293.74 → 4294.82] Received
[4294.82 → 4295.74] And believed
[4295.74 → 4296.46] First
[4296.46 → 4302.10] May that be
[4302.10 → 4302.88] Compelling
[4302.88 → 4303.70] Enough
[4303.70 → 4304.34] To them
[4304.34 → 4305.42] So that
[4305.42 → 4305.98] The obedience
[4305.98 → 4306.60] Can follow
[4306.60 → 4309.52] Demonstrate
[4309.52 → 4310.18] A transformed
[4310.18 → 4310.70] Life
[4310.70 → 4311.84] And then see
[4311.84 → 4312.20] How God
[4312.20 → 4312.80] Transforms
[4312.80 → 4313.08] The people
[4313.08 → 4313.90] Around you
[4313.90 → 4316.60] Christ
[4316.60 → 4317.50] Dwells
[4317.50 → 4318.16] In your
[4318.16 → 4318.78] Hearts
[4318.78 → 4320.06] Through faith
[4320.06 → 4320.42] That is
[4320.42 → 4321.04] Received
[4321.04 → 4322.04] Believed
[4322.04 → 4323.08] And achieved
[4323.08 → 4325.18] And this
[4325.18 → 4326.02] Pulling these
[4326.02 → 4326.70] Things together
[4326.70 → 4327.46] Now
[4327.46 → 4328.18] Is what it
[4328.18 → 4328.50] Means
[4328.50 → 4328.98] To be
[4328.98 → 4329.46] Rooted
[4329.46 → 4330.84] And grounded
[4330.84 → 4331.58] Or rooted
[4331.58 → 4332.60] And established
[4332.60 → 4333.44] Depending on
[4333.44 → 4333.98] The translation
[4333.98 → 4334.94] You read
[4334.94 → 4335.54] Right
[4335.54 → 4335.82] Paul
[4335.82 → 4336.44] He continues
[4336.44 → 4337.00] His prayer
[4337.00 → 4337.96] In verse 17
[4337.96 → 4339.24] Which is your
[4339.24 → 4340.30] Theme for this
[4340.30 → 4340.46] Year
[4340.46 → 4340.98] And I pray
[4340.98 → 4341.54] That you
[4341.54 → 4342.76] Being rooted
[4342.76 → 4344.06] And grounded
[4344.06 → 4345.80] In love
[4345.80 → 4347.64] Rooted
[4347.64 → 4348.92] And grounded
[4348.92 → 4350.76] Being rooted
[4350.76 → 4351.64] And grounded
[4351.64 → 4352.96] In the order
[4352.96 → 4354.08] Of Paul's
[4354.08 → 4354.64] Text
[4354.64 → 4355.82] Here
[4355.82 → 4356.36] Is the
[4356.36 → 4357.08] Result
[4357.08 → 4358.18] Of the
[4358.18 → 4358.68] Spirit
[4358.68 → 4359.48] Strengthening
[4359.48 → 4359.96] Your inner
[4359.96 → 4360.26] Being
[4360.26 → 4360.66] And the
[4360.66 → 4360.98] Result
[4360.98 → 4361.62] Of Christ
[4361.62 → 4362.34] Dwelling
[4362.34 → 4362.86] In your
[4362.86 → 4363.18] Hearts
[4363.18 → 4364.18] By faith
[4364.18 → 4364.52] And so
[4364.52 → 4364.94] Rooted
[4364.94 → 4365.74] And grounded
[4365.74 → 4366.24] Isn't
[4366.24 → 4366.58] Something
[4366.58 → 4367.30] We do
[4367.30 → 4367.80] It's
[4367.80 → 4368.14] Something
[4368.14 → 4369.18] That comes
[4369.18 → 4370.34] As God
[4370.34 → 4370.74] Does
[4370.74 → 4371.14] Something
[4371.14 → 4371.62] In
[4371.62 → 4372.64] Us
[4372.64 → 4374.54] Now these
[4374.54 → 4375.14] Two words
[4375.14 → 4376.68] Convey
[4376.68 → 4377.98] An image
[4377.98 → 4378.26] And you
[4378.26 → 4378.52] Kind of
[4378.52 → 4379.06] Saw that
[4379.06 → 4379.42] Already
[4379.42 → 4379.92] In the
[4379.92 → 4380.92] Image
[4380.92 → 4382.08] For today
[4382.08 → 4382.48] In the
[4382.48 → 4382.76] Screen
[4382.76 → 4383.70] Of a
[4383.70 → 4384.02] Plant
[4384.02 → 4385.14] Right
[4385.14 → 4385.58] Rooted
[4385.58 → 4386.36] Conveys
[4386.36 → 4386.86] An image
[4386.86 → 4387.16] Of a
[4387.16 → 4387.48] Tree
[4387.48 → 4388.64] With deep
[4388.64 → 4389.10] Roots
[4389.10 → 4389.70] That dig
[4389.70 → 4390.22] Down
[4390.22 → 4390.86] Into the
[4390.86 → 4391.24] Ground
[4391.24 → 4391.92] And hold
[4391.92 → 4392.52] It firms
[4392.52 → 4393.12] No matter
[4393.12 → 4393.94] What storms
[4393.94 → 4395.00] Or winds
[4395.00 → 4395.60] May come
[4395.60 → 4397.48] And grounded
[4397.48 → 4397.98] Is a
[4397.98 → 4398.56] Similar word
[4398.56 → 4398.92] It's a
[4398.92 → 4399.40] Word that
[4399.40 → 4399.70] Means
[4399.70 → 4401.16] Established
[4401.16 → 4402.40] Or foundational
[4402.40 → 4404.14] It's firm
[4404.14 → 4404.92] Like the
[4404.92 → 4405.62] Foundation
[4405.62 → 4405.94] Of a
[4405.94 → 4406.30] House
[4406.30 → 4407.58] I don't
[4407.58 → 4407.98] Know if
[4407.98 → 4408.84] In our
[4408.84 → 4409.06] House
[4409.06 → 4409.32] We have
[4409.32 → 4409.66] A crawl
[4409.66 → 4410.12] Space
[4410.12 → 4410.86] And in
[4410.86 → 4411.18] The crawl
[4411.18 → 4411.48] Space
[4411.48 → 4411.78] You can
[4411.78 → 4412.18] Go under
[4412.18 → 4412.44] There
[4412.44 → 4412.82] And see
[4412.82 → 4413.40] The concrete
[4413.40 → 4414.24] Walls
[4414.24 → 4414.58] And then
[4414.58 → 4415.08] Below
[4415.08 → 4415.52] That
[4415.52 → 4415.90] Is the
[4415.90 → 4416.30] Footings
[4416.30 → 4416.58] Of the
[4416.58 → 4417.08] Foundation
[4417.08 → 4418.94] My son
[4418.94 → 4419.32] Malachi
[4419.32 → 4420.16] Is the
[4420.16 → 4420.52] Only one
[4420.52 → 4420.76] Of us
[4420.76 → 4421.18] Who fits
[4421.18 → 4421.52] In the
[4421.52 → 4421.76] Crawl
[4421.76 → 4422.00] Space
[4422.00 → 4422.30] And so
[4422.30 → 4422.70] We send
[4422.70 → 4422.98] Him in
[4422.98 → 4423.14] There
[4423.14 → 4423.50] All the
[4423.50 → 4423.74] Time
[4423.74 → 4424.06] To get
[4424.06 → 4424.32] Stuff
[4424.32 → 4424.80] For us
[4424.80 → 4425.68] But if
[4425.68 → 4425.96] He went
[4425.96 → 4426.20] Up to
[4426.20 → 4426.70] Those walls
[4426.70 → 4426.96] On the
[4426.96 → 4427.32] Outside
[4427.32 → 4427.74] And pushed
[4427.74 → 4428.12] As hard
[4428.12 → 4428.34] As he
[4428.34 → 4428.60] Could
[4428.60 → 4429.58] They
[4429.58 → 4429.80] Wouldn't
[4429.80 → 4430.10] Move
[4430.10 → 4432.48] That
[4432.48 → 4433.02] Foundation
[4433.02 → 4433.46] Holds
[4433.46 → 4433.72] Up the
[4433.72 → 4434.12] Entire
[4434.12 → 4434.52] House
[4434.52 → 4436.36] That's
[4436.36 → 4436.54] The
[4436.54 → 4436.82] Image
[4436.82 → 4437.10] Here
[4437.10 → 4439.20] Build your
[4439.20 → 4439.58] House on
[4439.58 → 4439.94] A rock
[4439.94 → 4440.18] And when
[4440.18 → 4440.52] The flood
[4440.52 → 4440.80] Waters
[4440.80 → 4441.20] Come
[4441.20 → 4441.60] It will
[4441.60 → 4441.98] Not be
[4441.98 → 4442.28] Washed
[4442.28 → 4442.58] Away
[4442.58 → 4444.66] But again
[4444.66 → 4446.14] Hear this

[4446.38 → 4446.84] Clearly

[4448.46 → 4448.96] And
[4448.96 → 4450.06] Grounded
[4450.06 → 4450.92] Comes
[4450.92 → 4451.28] As a
[4451.28 → 4451.70] Result
[4451.70 → 4452.08] Of the
[4452.08 → 4452.28] Holy
[4452.28 → 4452.66] Spirit
[4452.66 → 4453.30] Strengthening

[4459.62 → 4459.76] The
[4459.76 → 4459.92] Holy
[4459.92 → 4460.22] Spirit

[4637.48 → 4637.82] Straight
[4637.82 → 4638.08] Up
[4638.08 → 4639.46] That's
[4639.46 → 4639.64] Because
[4639.64 → 4639.86] Those
[4639.86 → 4640.12] Trees
[4640.12 → 4640.28] Are
