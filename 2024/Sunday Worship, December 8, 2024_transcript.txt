[2309.88 --> 2339.86]  Thank you.
[2339.88 --> 2369.88]  Hello.
[2369.88 --> 2399.88]  Thank you.
[2399.88 --> 2429.88]  Thank you.
[2429.88 --> 2459.86]  Thank you.
[2459.88 --> 2489.88]  Thank you.
[2489.88 --> 2519.86]  Thank you.
[2519.86 --> 2549.84]  Thank you.
[2549.86 --> 2579.84]  Thank you.
[2579.84 --> 2609.84]  Thank you.
[2609.84 --> 2639.84]  Thank you.
[2639.84 --> 2669.82]  Thank you.
[2669.84 --> 2699.82]  Thank you.
[2699.84 --> 2729.82]  This Advent.
[2729.84 --> 2759.84]  Thank you.
[2759.84 --> 2789.84]  Thank you.
[2789.84 --> 2819.84] 
[2819.84 --> 2849.84]  Thank you.
[2849.84 --> 2879.82]  Advent.
[2879.84 --> 2909.84]  that last.
[2909.84 --> 2939.84]  Thank you.
[2939.86 --> 2969.82]  here, vrai lit...
[2969.82 --> 2972.14]  Oh, if that other guy gets in.
[2973.72 --> 2976.96]  Some of us are looking south of the border and we're like,
[2977.06 --> 2979.38]  man, that chaos should finally end.
[2979.52 --> 2983.76]  And others of us are like, man, that 25% tariff's really going to do a number to our economy.
[2986.24 --> 2989.40]  We all have these hopes and circumstances,
[2989.70 --> 2993.74]  and these hopes stretch us toward an idea of peace,
[2994.40 --> 2997.10]  an idea of settled assurance.
[2997.10 --> 3002.18]  And we just want to find it.
[3003.18 --> 3004.90]  And we want it to make sense.
[3005.10 --> 3007.96]  And not just to us, but to the people around us, right?
[3008.00 --> 3010.76]  We want them to get it so that they can get us
[3010.76 --> 3015.10]  and so that we can finally not feel alone in the struggle that we've been carrying.
[3017.14 --> 3021.44]  Like, make no mistake about it, for all the happy songs and the joyful music
[3021.44 --> 3025.74]  and the nice seasonal lattes at Starbucks,
[3025.74 --> 3028.40]  the season of Christmas has a weight to it
[3028.40 --> 3032.26]  that is sometimes impossible to put words to.
[3033.82 --> 3038.04]  So what is our hope this Christmas season?
[3038.40 --> 3043.16]  And can the thing that we are hoping for actually do what we hope it will do?
[3043.16 --> 3048.66]  Or is there something deeper, something more, something greater
[3048.66 --> 3053.64]  about this time, this season, and this moment?
[3056.12 --> 3058.38]  Now it's going to make no surprise to anyone here,
[3058.66 --> 3060.44]  because you're here and it's me,
[3060.58 --> 3062.24]  I want to suggest this morning
[3062.24 --> 3067.78]  that Jesus is your unexpected hope this season.
[3067.78 --> 3071.70]  That the thing that you are longing for,
[3071.86 --> 3076.12]  the hope that you are putting all your energy towards,
[3076.48 --> 3081.70]  actually only rightly is the person of Jesus.
[3083.46 --> 3085.84]  And that those other things,
[3085.98 --> 3087.76]  whether they're Nintendo Switches
[3087.76 --> 3090.00]  or a sea change in the political landscape,
[3090.00 --> 3096.66]  are inadequate to solve the problems and longings of our hearts.
[3098.70 --> 3101.26]  Now I want to get at that and see that,
[3102.00 --> 3105.84]  hopefully in the way that Isaiah does,
[3106.44 --> 3111.20]  and the way that he provides a hope for a people.
[3111.36 --> 3116.32]  And so Isaiah is a 7th, 8th century prophet in Israel,
[3116.32 --> 3119.12]  and he's foretelling of a time
[3119.12 --> 3123.18]  when the people of Israel will be taken away into exile
[3123.18 --> 3126.12]  because of their sin and their disobedience to God.
[3126.20 --> 3127.58]  When another nation will come
[3127.58 --> 3130.30]  and will destroy them
[3130.30 --> 3133.16]  and will carry them away.
[3134.50 --> 3137.30]  And so these people need a word of hope.
[3138.52 --> 3140.28]  And that's what's being offered here.
[3141.42 --> 3143.50]  Our text starts, if you have it in front of you,
[3143.56 --> 3144.46]  in verse 1 it says,
[3144.46 --> 3147.82]  a shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse.
[3148.56 --> 3150.30]  Now there's some layering of images here
[3150.30 --> 3152.32]  that are important for us to understand,
[3152.46 --> 3155.52]  to hear the weight of what is going on here.
[3156.18 --> 3159.06]  A few chapters before in Isaiah 6,
[3159.88 --> 3163.04]  the prophet recalls how God calls him
[3163.04 --> 3165.98]  to this ministry of being a prophet,
[3166.22 --> 3169.22]  and God tells Isaiah that he,
[3169.70 --> 3172.04]  what he will tell to the people of Israel,
[3172.14 --> 3173.60]  what message he will give.
[3173.60 --> 3176.74]  And part of the description in Isaiah 6, verse 13,
[3177.38 --> 3180.90]  is God says that the cities and houses of Israel
[3180.90 --> 3183.14]  will be destroyed by Assyria,
[3183.50 --> 3185.02]  a nation state to the north,
[3185.30 --> 3188.94]  and will be like a forest raised.
[3189.86 --> 3189.96]  Right?
[3190.02 --> 3192.06]  So only stumps remain.
[3193.70 --> 3195.90]  Assyria is the nation state
[3195.90 --> 3198.78]  that God will use to punish the Israelites
[3198.78 --> 3201.80]  for their idolatry and for their waywardness.
[3201.80 --> 3203.38]  But even in that,
[3203.78 --> 3207.10]  God uses Isaiah to give the people of Israel a hope.
[3207.70 --> 3207.80]  Right?
[3207.82 --> 3208.26]  And he says,
[3208.72 --> 3209.18]  don't worry,
[3209.40 --> 3212.40]  Assyria too will fall under my own judgment.
[3212.40 --> 3215.34]  And he promises that Assyria will be destroyed
[3215.34 --> 3218.04]  after God has finished using them.
[3218.70 --> 3220.46]  So Israel will be restored
[3220.46 --> 3222.62]  and Assyria destroyed.
[3222.74 --> 3224.50]  And God uses two images
[3224.50 --> 3226.88]  to reveal this destruction.
[3228.00 --> 3228.58]  He says,
[3228.72 --> 3232.16]  Assyria and Israel will be like forests
[3232.16 --> 3235.32]  completely and utterly destroyed
[3235.32 --> 3236.86]  by an axe.
[3237.54 --> 3239.24]  You can read that in Isaiah 10,
[3239.72 --> 3241.44]  verse 15, 18, and 19.
[3242.40 --> 3242.98]  And in fact,
[3243.06 --> 3244.96]  the verses right before ours,
[3245.14 --> 3246.38]  the end of chapter 10,
[3247.12 --> 3247.52]  read,
[3247.52 --> 3250.52]  The Lord Almighty
[3250.52 --> 3252.42]  will lop off the boughs
[3252.42 --> 3253.80]  with great power.
[3254.04 --> 3256.18]  The lofty trees will be felled.
[3256.32 --> 3258.30]  The tall ones will be brought low.
[3258.60 --> 3260.66]  He will cut down the forest thickets
[3260.66 --> 3261.42]  with an axe.
[3261.80 --> 3262.98]  Lebanon will fall
[3262.98 --> 3264.60]  before the mighty one.
[3266.66 --> 3267.28]  Now, Lebanon
[3267.28 --> 3269.76]  is a major city,
[3269.96 --> 3271.48]  an economic hub
[3271.48 --> 3272.98]  to the north of Israel,
[3272.98 --> 3275.60]  and it's under Assyrian control
[3275.60 --> 3277.34]  by the time of Isaiah.
[3277.92 --> 3279.16]  And if you are familiar
[3279.16 --> 3280.86]  with the Bible at all,
[3280.96 --> 3282.16]  you may have heard
[3282.16 --> 3284.28]  the cedars of Lebanon.
[3285.14 --> 3286.20]  The cedars of Lebanon
[3286.20 --> 3287.14]  are these great,
[3287.56 --> 3288.14]  massive,
[3288.48 --> 3290.22]  old-growth trees
[3290.22 --> 3291.28]  in Lebanon
[3291.28 --> 3292.46]  that are prized
[3292.46 --> 3293.88]  around the entire
[3293.88 --> 3295.08]  ancient Near East
[3295.08 --> 3298.22]  as prime building materials.
[3299.18 --> 3300.56]  Temples and palaces
[3300.56 --> 3302.36]  throughout the region
[3302.36 --> 3304.40]  have used cedars
[3304.40 --> 3305.22]  from Lebanon
[3305.22 --> 3308.12]  to be constructed.
[3308.68 --> 3308.94]  In fact,
[3309.04 --> 3310.00]  in 1 Kings 5,
[3310.16 --> 3310.82]  you can read
[3310.82 --> 3311.44]  that Solomon,
[3311.84 --> 3312.66]  the son of David,
[3312.84 --> 3313.76]  the great king of Israel,
[3313.96 --> 3315.48]  used cedars from Lebanon
[3315.48 --> 3317.02]  to build the temple.
[3318.78 --> 3320.28]  And as a judgment oracle,
[3320.42 --> 3321.56]  now here in Isaiah,
[3321.94 --> 3324.14]  against Israel's idolatry
[3324.14 --> 3325.76]  and Assyria's abuses,
[3326.08 --> 3326.86]  God says
[3326.86 --> 3328.30]  that he will cut them all down.
[3328.94 --> 3330.86]  He will lay them all low
[3330.86 --> 3332.54]  that only stumps
[3332.54 --> 3333.70]  will remain.
[3334.68 --> 3335.90]  The image is kind of like
[3335.90 --> 3337.10]  a clear-cut forest.
[3338.40 --> 3339.38]  And yet,
[3339.68 --> 3342.60]  even in this clear-cut forest,
[3342.60 --> 3344.40]  there is hope.
[3345.72 --> 3346.28]  Right?
[3346.34 --> 3348.10]  Because one of these stumps,
[3348.36 --> 3349.14]  we are told,
[3349.82 --> 3350.54]  is Jesse.
[3350.54 --> 3350.62]  Jesse.
[3351.82 --> 3353.66]  And from that stump,
[3354.22 --> 3356.14]  a tiny shoot will spring.
[3356.46 --> 3358.00]  Even in all of that judgment
[3358.00 --> 3358.76]  and destruction,
[3359.36 --> 3360.98]  hope springs up.
[3361.22 --> 3363.24]  A promise pops through.
[3365.40 --> 3365.70]  Now,
[3366.66 --> 3367.64]  a little bit of
[3367.64 --> 3369.50]  biblical history here.
[3369.78 --> 3372.72]  Jesse is the father of David,
[3373.10 --> 3375.50]  the great king of Israel.
[3376.50 --> 3376.90]  Right?
[3376.90 --> 3377.22]  David,
[3377.38 --> 3378.44]  we are told over and over
[3378.44 --> 3378.98]  and over again,
[3379.04 --> 3380.08]  even though he's not near
[3380.08 --> 3381.92]  a perfect man
[3381.92 --> 3382.84]  or perfect king,
[3382.88 --> 3383.52]  we are told that
[3383.52 --> 3385.58]  he is a man after God's own heart.
[3386.40 --> 3388.24]  And God promised David
[3388.24 --> 3389.68]  that of his kingdom
[3389.68 --> 3391.12]  there would be no end.
[3392.16 --> 3393.12]  He said to him,
[3393.24 --> 3393.98]  your house
[3393.98 --> 3395.18]  and your kingdom
[3395.18 --> 3396.94]  will endure forever
[3396.94 --> 3398.10]  before me.
[3398.24 --> 3399.00]  Your throne
[3399.00 --> 3400.14]  will be established
[3400.14 --> 3400.98]  forever.
[3402.26 --> 3403.50]  And these are words
[3403.50 --> 3404.74]  that are echoed
[3404.74 --> 3405.58]  and promised
[3405.58 --> 3406.64]  in Isaiah 7,
[3406.72 --> 3408.02]  where we looked
[3408.02 --> 3409.00]  last time.
[3409.78 --> 3410.56]  But now,
[3410.68 --> 3411.52]  when Isaiah says
[3411.52 --> 3412.72]  that from the stump
[3412.72 --> 3413.52]  of Jesse,
[3413.88 --> 3415.06]  this hope will rise,
[3415.38 --> 3416.44]  God is keeping
[3416.44 --> 3417.36]  his promise
[3417.36 --> 3418.14]  and yet,
[3418.24 --> 3419.84]  he's separating
[3419.84 --> 3420.86]  that promise
[3420.86 --> 3421.76]  from the pomp
[3421.76 --> 3422.70]  and circumstance
[3422.70 --> 3424.00]  and the glory
[3424.00 --> 3425.56]  of the royal house.
[3426.38 --> 3426.50]  Right?
[3426.60 --> 3427.46]  David isn't
[3427.46 --> 3428.38]  the focus here.
[3429.22 --> 3429.58]  Instead,
[3429.78 --> 3430.62]  he's reminding
[3430.62 --> 3431.28]  the readers
[3431.28 --> 3432.30]  of David's
[3432.30 --> 3434.06]  peasant origins.
[3434.74 --> 3435.78]  his father,
[3436.44 --> 3436.76]  Jesse.
[3438.14 --> 3438.48]  Right?
[3438.52 --> 3439.66]  Jesse was a
[3439.66 --> 3440.68]  backcountry
[3440.68 --> 3442.52]  father of
[3442.52 --> 3443.56]  shepherds
[3443.56 --> 3444.74]  and livestock
[3444.74 --> 3445.58]  keepers.
[3446.10 --> 3447.24]  And what effectively
[3447.24 --> 3448.02]  is happening here
[3448.02 --> 3449.42]  is God is saying
[3449.42 --> 3451.30]  that it's not
[3451.30 --> 3452.16]  about
[3452.16 --> 3453.62]  the promise
[3453.62 --> 3455.04]  so much
[3455.04 --> 3455.96]  as it is about
[3455.96 --> 3456.92]  the one who gives
[3456.92 --> 3457.90]  the promise.
[3458.98 --> 3459.36]  Right?
[3459.38 --> 3460.24]  It's not about David.
[3460.64 --> 3461.96]  It's about his God.
[3463.16 --> 3463.30]  Right?
[3463.30 --> 3464.76]  God will do it
[3464.76 --> 3465.44]  himself.
[3465.68 --> 3466.78]  He is the one
[3466.78 --> 3467.24]  who will make
[3467.24 --> 3468.20]  the shoot rise
[3468.20 --> 3469.10]  from the stump.
[3469.20 --> 3469.98]  He is the one
[3469.98 --> 3470.40]  who will make
[3470.40 --> 3471.52]  the branch grow.
[3471.72 --> 3472.56]  He is the one
[3472.56 --> 3473.30]  who will cause it
[3473.30 --> 3474.64]  to bear fruit.
[3474.76 --> 3475.36]  In short,
[3475.54 --> 3477.08]  salvation and judgment
[3477.08 --> 3478.82]  are from God.
[3479.26 --> 3479.70]  Redemption
[3479.70 --> 3481.10]  is his gift
[3481.10 --> 3481.72]  of grace
[3481.72 --> 3482.66]  and faithful
[3482.66 --> 3484.02]  to his promise.
[3484.14 --> 3484.26]  Right?
[3484.48 --> 3485.24]  His zeal
[3485.24 --> 3486.58]  will accomplish this.
[3486.58 --> 3487.56]  The hope
[3487.56 --> 3488.48]  that the people
[3488.48 --> 3489.72]  can place
[3489.72 --> 3491.04]  their longings
[3491.04 --> 3491.28]  in,
[3491.38 --> 3492.60]  the desire
[3492.60 --> 3493.52]  that they have
[3493.52 --> 3494.70]  needs to be
[3494.70 --> 3496.36]  for God
[3496.36 --> 3498.22]  and not
[3498.22 --> 3498.96]  for something else.
[3500.32 --> 3500.68]  Now,
[3500.72 --> 3501.54]  this image
[3501.54 --> 3502.20]  compounds
[3502.20 --> 3503.48]  as the shoot
[3503.48 --> 3504.92]  rises from the stump
[3504.92 --> 3505.72]  and it becomes
[3505.72 --> 3506.56]  a branch.
[3507.12 --> 3508.22]  A branch
[3508.22 --> 3509.36]  that will bear fruit.
[3510.24 --> 3510.74]  And that image
[3510.74 --> 3511.46]  of a branch,
[3512.02 --> 3513.74]  two later prophets,
[3513.96 --> 3514.28]  Jeremiah
[3514.28 --> 3515.74]  and Zechariah,
[3515.86 --> 3517.04]  who prophesied
[3517.04 --> 3518.32]  during the exile
[3518.32 --> 3520.08]  and after the exile,
[3520.26 --> 3521.44]  so two,
[3521.62 --> 3522.48]  three hundred years
[3522.48 --> 3523.46]  after Isaiah,
[3524.16 --> 3525.90]  they take this image
[3525.90 --> 3527.06]  of a branch
[3527.06 --> 3529.58]  and they personify it
[3529.58 --> 3530.48]  as a title.
[3531.54 --> 3532.60]  They take the image
[3532.60 --> 3533.36]  of a branch
[3533.36 --> 3535.54]  and Jeremiah says
[3535.54 --> 3536.28]  the branch
[3536.28 --> 3537.28]  will be called
[3537.28 --> 3538.04]  the Lord
[3538.04 --> 3539.70]  our righteous Savior.
[3541.30 --> 3542.06]  Effectively,
[3542.56 --> 3543.08]  confirming
[3543.08 --> 3544.32]  that the branch
[3544.32 --> 3546.58]  is the Messiah
[3546.58 --> 3547.42]  who will be
[3547.42 --> 3548.68]  both man
[3548.68 --> 3549.68]  and
[3549.68 --> 3551.64]  the Lord.
[3552.12 --> 3552.24]  Right?
[3552.36 --> 3553.36]  Man from the line
[3553.36 --> 3553.94]  of David
[3553.94 --> 3555.08]  and the Lord
[3555.08 --> 3556.68]  because the name
[3556.68 --> 3557.28]  he uses,
[3557.44 --> 3557.82]  the Lord
[3557.82 --> 3558.72]  our righteous Savior,
[3558.84 --> 3559.38]  if you were to look
[3559.38 --> 3560.42]  at Jeremiah 23
[3560.42 --> 3561.02]  verse 5
[3561.02 --> 3561.54]  in your Bibles,
[3561.70 --> 3562.60]  that word Lord
[3562.60 --> 3563.68]  is in all caps,
[3564.28 --> 3565.26]  which means
[3565.26 --> 3566.14]  it's the covenant
[3566.14 --> 3567.28]  name for God.
[3567.72 --> 3568.38]  It's Yahweh.
[3569.88 --> 3570.46]  So Jeremiah
[3570.46 --> 3571.66]  says that the Messiah,
[3572.12 --> 3572.78]  the one who
[3572.78 --> 3573.94]  we hope in
[3573.94 --> 3574.72]  will be God
[3574.72 --> 3575.84]  and man.
[3575.84 --> 3576.36]  He will be
[3576.36 --> 3576.92]  the God
[3576.92 --> 3577.58]  man.
[3577.74 --> 3577.96]  And then
[3577.96 --> 3578.84]  Zechariah
[3578.84 --> 3579.68]  adds
[3579.68 --> 3580.80]  that this
[3580.80 --> 3581.64]  branch
[3581.64 --> 3582.42]  will be
[3582.42 --> 3583.46]  a priest
[3583.46 --> 3584.10]  who sits
[3584.10 --> 3584.72]  on a throne
[3584.72 --> 3585.30]  and is given
[3585.30 --> 3585.84]  a crown.
[3587.12 --> 3587.88]  Now in Israel
[3587.88 --> 3588.76]  there are no
[3588.76 --> 3589.78]  priest kings.
[3590.88 --> 3591.76]  There's priests
[3591.76 --> 3592.66]  and there's kings
[3592.66 --> 3593.74]  but in Zechariah
[3593.74 --> 3594.28]  the branch
[3594.28 --> 3595.54]  is both.
[3595.68 --> 3596.00]  And so
[3596.00 --> 3596.74]  not only
[3596.74 --> 3597.44]  let's compound
[3597.44 --> 3597.94]  the image
[3597.94 --> 3598.26]  you have
[3598.26 --> 3599.00]  the Messiah
[3599.00 --> 3599.42]  who is
[3599.42 --> 3599.88]  the God
[3599.88 --> 3600.42]  man
[3600.42 --> 3601.54]  who is
[3601.54 --> 3602.24]  man from
[3602.24 --> 3602.66]  the line
[3602.66 --> 3603.20]  of David
[3603.20 --> 3604.10]  and himself
[3604.10 --> 3604.58]  God
[3604.58 --> 3605.14]  the Lord
[3605.14 --> 3606.20]  and who
[3606.20 --> 3606.78]  is the
[3606.78 --> 3607.56]  high priest
[3607.56 --> 3608.76]  and true
[3608.76 --> 3609.46]  king.
[3611.32 --> 3611.96]  Isaiah
[3611.96 --> 3613.10]  is stacking
[3613.10 --> 3614.52]  these layers
[3614.52 --> 3615.16]  of meaning
[3615.16 --> 3616.08]  to fulfill
[3616.08 --> 3617.30]  what our hope
[3617.30 --> 3618.02]  should be
[3618.02 --> 3618.68]  and if you're
[3618.68 --> 3619.14]  following along
[3619.14 --> 3619.82]  we haven't even
[3619.82 --> 3620.54]  left verse 1
[3620.54 --> 3620.82]  yet.
[3624.12 --> 3624.80]  Now
[3624.80 --> 3626.20]  to be clear
[3626.20 --> 3627.38]  at this point
[3627.38 --> 3628.68]  I still haven't
[3628.68 --> 3629.36]  yet said anything
[3629.36 --> 3630.12]  about Jesus
[3630.12 --> 3632.18]  or about
[3632.18 --> 3632.46]  Jesus
[3632.46 --> 3633.40]  as the Messiah.
[3634.56 --> 3635.32]  We've only
[3635.32 --> 3635.80]  heard
[3635.80 --> 3636.34]  that the
[3636.34 --> 3636.98]  people's hope
[3636.98 --> 3637.78]  is for
[3637.78 --> 3638.70]  a Messiah
[3638.70 --> 3639.40]  but we don't
[3639.40 --> 3639.86]  yet know
[3639.86 --> 3640.44]  who that
[3640.44 --> 3640.96]  will be
[3640.96 --> 3641.70]  or how
[3641.70 --> 3642.10]  that will
[3642.10 --> 3642.64]  come about.
[3644.56 --> 3645.16]  Now
[3645.16 --> 3646.08]  the title
[3646.08 --> 3646.82]  Messiah
[3646.82 --> 3649.14]  comes from
[3649.14 --> 3649.82]  the Hebrew
[3649.82 --> 3650.32]  word
[3650.32 --> 3650.98]  Meshach
[3650.98 --> 3652.36]  which comes
[3652.36 --> 3653.22]  from a root
[3653.22 --> 3653.98]  if you remember
[3653.98 --> 3654.44]  Hebrew
[3654.44 --> 3656.34]  words are all
[3656.34 --> 3656.98]  brought down
[3656.98 --> 3657.76]  low into a
[3657.76 --> 3658.50]  three stem root
[3658.50 --> 3659.32]  the root
[3659.32 --> 3659.70]  there is
[3659.70 --> 3660.20]  Meshach
[3660.20 --> 3660.66]  which means
[3660.66 --> 3661.10]  oil.
[3662.42 --> 3662.64]  And so
[3662.64 --> 3663.22]  Messiah
[3663.22 --> 3664.82]  literally means
[3664.82 --> 3665.54]  one who is
[3665.54 --> 3666.16]  anointed with
[3666.16 --> 3666.72]  oil or
[3666.72 --> 3667.50]  the anointed
[3667.50 --> 3667.98]  one.
[3668.90 --> 3669.74]  The Messiah
[3669.74 --> 3670.60]  is the
[3670.60 --> 3671.16]  anointed
[3671.16 --> 3672.12]  one.
[3672.24 --> 3672.50]  And so
[3672.50 --> 3673.72]  let's do a
[3673.72 --> 3674.40]  little bit of
[3674.40 --> 3675.28]  biblical theology
[3675.28 --> 3675.76]  together.
[3676.80 --> 3677.60]  Psalm 2
[3677.60 --> 3679.04]  which has
[3679.04 --> 3679.62]  long been
[3679.62 --> 3680.26]  recognized
[3680.26 --> 3681.72]  by the Jews
[3681.72 --> 3682.16]  as a
[3682.16 --> 3682.80]  messianic
[3682.80 --> 3683.32]  psalm.
[3683.48 --> 3684.06]  Psalm 2
[3684.06 --> 3684.60]  says
[3684.60 --> 3685.98]  the kings
[3685.98 --> 3686.74]  of the earth
[3686.74 --> 3687.32]  rise up
[3687.32 --> 3687.70]  and the
[3687.70 --> 3688.06]  rulers
[3688.06 --> 3688.48]  band
[3688.48 --> 3689.02]  together
[3689.02 --> 3689.50]  against
[3689.50 --> 3690.06]  the Lord
[3690.06 --> 3690.80]  and against
[3690.80 --> 3691.82]  his
[3691.82 --> 3692.94]  anointed.
[3694.44 --> 3695.00]  Isaiah
[3695.00 --> 3696.04]  chapter 61
[3696.04 --> 3696.48]  says
[3696.48 --> 3697.34]  the spirit
[3697.34 --> 3697.76]  of the
[3697.76 --> 3698.06]  sovereign
[3698.06 --> 3698.28]  Lord
[3698.28 --> 3698.74]  is on
[3698.74 --> 3698.92]  me
[3698.92 --> 3699.22]  because
[3699.22 --> 3699.42]  the
[3699.42 --> 3699.64]  Lord
[3699.64 --> 3700.00]  has
[3700.00 --> 3700.66]  anointed
[3700.66 --> 3701.16]  me
[3701.16 --> 3701.50]  to
[3701.50 --> 3701.88]  proclaim
[3701.88 --> 3702.22]  good
[3702.22 --> 3702.48]  news
[3702.48 --> 3702.78]  to the
[3702.78 --> 3703.08]  poor.
[3703.44 --> 3703.52]  He
[3703.52 --> 3703.70]  has
[3703.70 --> 3703.90]  set
[3703.90 --> 3704.06]  me
[3704.06 --> 3704.24]  to
[3704.24 --> 3704.50]  bind
[3704.50 --> 3704.66]  up
[3704.66 --> 3704.78]  the
[3704.78 --> 3705.02]  broken
[3705.02 --> 3705.46]  hearted
[3705.46 --> 3705.62]  to
[3705.62 --> 3705.96]  proclaim
[3705.96 --> 3706.36]  freedom
[3706.36 --> 3706.72]  for the
[3706.72 --> 3707.12]  captives
[3707.12 --> 3707.62]  and release
[3707.62 --> 3707.82]  from
[3707.82 --> 3708.22]  darkness
[3708.22 --> 3708.98]  for the
[3708.98 --> 3709.30]  prisoners
[3709.30 --> 3709.90]  to
[3709.90 --> 3710.32]  proclaim
[3710.32 --> 3710.68]  the
[3710.68 --> 3711.00]  year
[3711.00 --> 3711.18]  of
[3711.18 --> 3711.30]  the
[3711.30 --> 3711.72]  Lord's
[3711.72 --> 3712.16]  favor
[3712.16 --> 3712.72]  and
[3712.72 --> 3712.86]  the
[3712.86 --> 3713.14]  day
[3713.14 --> 3713.38]  of
[3713.38 --> 3713.86]  vengeance
[3713.86 --> 3714.32]  of
[3714.32 --> 3714.46]  our
[3714.46 --> 3714.78]  God
[3714.78 --> 3715.10]  to
[3715.10 --> 3715.54]  comfort
[3715.54 --> 3716.14]  all
[3716.14 --> 3716.36]  who
[3716.36 --> 3716.80]  mourn
[3718.48 --> 3718.72]  who
[3718.72 --> 3719.18]  grieve
[3719.18 --> 3720.02]  in
[3720.02 --> 3720.38]  Zion.
[3721.06 --> 3721.82]  Anointed
[3721.82 --> 3723.00]  me.
[3723.60 --> 3723.84]  And then
[3723.84 --> 3724.48]  powerfully
[3724.48 --> 3724.98]  I think
[3724.98 --> 3725.46]  in
[3725.46 --> 3726.22]  Daniel
[3726.22 --> 3728.10]  9
[3728.10 --> 3729.14]  we read
[3729.14 --> 3729.52]  this
[3729.52 --> 3730.54]  know
[3730.54 --> 3730.90]  and
[3730.90 --> 3731.50]  understand
[3731.50 --> 3732.28]  this
[3732.28 --> 3733.48]  from
[3733.48 --> 3733.66]  the
[3733.66 --> 3734.04]  time
[3734.04 --> 3734.24]  the
[3734.24 --> 3734.52]  word
[3734.52 --> 3734.82]  goes
[3734.82 --> 3735.08]  out
[3735.08 --> 3735.28]  to
[3735.28 --> 3735.82]  restore
[3735.82 --> 3736.08]  and
[3736.08 --> 3736.56]  rebuild
[3736.56 --> 3737.18]  Jerusalem
[3737.18 --> 3737.86]  until
[3737.86 --> 3738.36]  the
[3738.36 --> 3738.92]  anointed
[3738.92 --> 3739.42]  one
[3739.42 --> 3739.94]  the
[3739.94 --> 3740.28]  ruler
[3740.28 --> 3740.80]  comes
[3740.80 --> 3741.02]  there
[3741.02 --> 3741.16]  will
[3741.16 --> 3741.36]  be
[3741.36 --> 3741.70]  seven
[3741.70 --> 3742.34]  sevens

[3769.24 --> 3769.44]  this
[3769.44 --> 3769.70]  morning
[3769.70 --> 3769.96]  is
[3769.96 --> 3770.16]  the
[3770.16 --> 3770.70]  conclusion
[3770.70 --> 3771.00]  of
[3771.00 --> 3771.16]  what
[3771.16 --> 3771.50]  Daniel
[3771.50 --> 3771.76]  is
[3771.76 --> 3772.08]  saying
[3772.08 --> 3772.62]  the
[3772.62 --> 3773.06]  conclusion
[3773.06 --> 3773.34]  is
[3773.34 --> 3773.52]  that
[3778.46 --> 3778.94]  God
[3778.94 --> 3779.28]  will
[3779.28 --> 3780.02]  remove
[3780.02 --> 3780.62]  sin
[3780.62 --> 3780.94]  and
[3780.94 --> 3781.62]  establish
[3781.62 --> 3782.26]  righteousness
[3782.26 --> 3783.10]  through
[3783.10 --> 3783.64]  his
[3783.64 --> 3784.32]  anointed
[3784.32 --> 3785.28]  one
[3785.28 --> 3786.10]  through
[3786.10 --> 3786.30]  the
[3786.30 --> 3786.72]  Messiah
[3786.72 --> 3787.94]  the
[3787.94 --> 3788.50]  hope
[3788.50 --> 3789.46]  right
[3789.46 --> 3790.46]  is
[3790.46 --> 3790.66]  for
[3790.66 --> 3790.84]  an
[3790.84 --> 3791.24]  anointed
[3791.24 --> 3791.68]  one
[3791.68 --> 3793.00]  this
[3793.00 --> 3793.14]  is
[3793.14 --> 3793.32]  the
[3793.32 --> 3793.76]  same
[3793.76 --> 3794.32]  hope
[3794.32 --> 3794.84]  that
[3794.84 --> 3795.24]  comes
[3795.24 --> 3795.52]  from
[3795.52 --> 3795.74]  the
[3795.74 --> 3796.08]  stump
[3796.08 --> 3796.70]  of
[3796.70 --> 3797.08]  Jesse
[3797.08 --> 3797.38]  and
[3797.38 --> 3797.92]  I
[3797.92 --> 3798.44]  believe
[3798.44 --> 3798.88]  and
[3798.88 --> 3799.04]  I
[3799.04 --> 3799.24]  think
[3799.24 --> 3799.90]  Isaiah
[3799.90 --> 3800.62]  confirms
[3800.62 --> 3801.10]  actually
[3801.10 --> 3801.40]  for
[3801.40 --> 3801.66]  us
[3801.66 --> 3801.86]  that
[3801.86 --> 3802.32]  the
[3802.32 --> 3802.64]  hope
[3802.64 --> 3802.92]  of
[3802.92 --> 3803.12]  the
[3803.12 --> 3803.58]  anointed
[3803.58 --> 3804.06]  one
[3804.06 --> 3805.18]  is
[3805.18 --> 3805.56]  named
[3805.56 --> 3806.34]  Jesus
[3806.34 --> 3808.02]  that
[3808.02 --> 3808.14]  when
[3808.14 --> 3808.28]  you
[3808.28 --> 3808.48]  look
[3808.48 --> 3808.60]  at
[3808.60 --> 3808.72]  the
[3808.72 --> 3808.98]  hopes
[3808.98 --> 3809.58]  expressed
[3809.58 --> 3810.04]  for
[3810.04 --> 3810.28]  the
[3810.28 --> 3810.70]  anointed
[3810.70 --> 3811.10]  one
[3811.10 --> 3811.82]  only
[3811.82 --> 3812.18]  one
[3812.18 --> 3812.60]  person
[3812.60 --> 3813.06]  fits
[3813.06 --> 3813.44]  that
[3813.44 --> 3814.56]  and
[3814.56 --> 3814.72]  we
[3814.72 --> 3814.94]  know
[3814.94 --> 3815.16]  him
[3815.16 --> 3815.48]  as
[3815.48 --> 3816.50]  Jesus
[3816.50 --> 3818.56]  and
[3818.56 --> 3818.68]  so
[3818.68 --> 3818.84]  in
[3818.84 --> 3819.04]  verse
[3819.04 --> 3819.44]  2
[3819.44 --> 3820.66]  Isaiah
[3820.66 --> 3821.06]  says
[3821.06 --> 3821.50]  that
[3821.50 --> 3821.66]  the
[3821.66 --> 3822.12]  spirit
[3822.12 --> 3822.34]  of
[3822.34 --> 3822.50]  the
[3822.50 --> 3822.76]  Lord
[3822.76 --> 3823.00]  will
[3823.00 --> 3823.46]  rest
[3823.46 --> 3823.76]  on
[3823.76 --> 3824.04]  him
[3824.04 --> 3824.94]  this
[3824.94 --> 3825.10]  is
[3825.10 --> 3825.32]  again
[3825.32 --> 3825.52]  this
[3825.52 --> 3825.66]  is
[3825.66 --> 3826.36]  anointing
[3826.36 --> 3827.30]  language
[3827.30 --> 3828.28]  the
[3828.28 --> 3828.60]  spirit
[3828.60 --> 3829.14]  resting
[3829.14 --> 3829.48]  and

[3837.62 --> 3838.28]  16
[3838.28 --> 3839.08]  we
[3839.08 --> 3839.38]  read
[3839.38 --> 3839.58]  that
[3839.58 --> 3840.00]  as
[3840.00 --> 3840.28]  soon
[3840.28 --> 3840.56]  as
[3840.56 --> 3840.96]  Jesus
[3840.96 --> 3841.32]  was
[3841.32 --> 3841.76]  baptized
[3841.76 --> 3842.24]  he
[3842.24 --> 3842.42]  went

[4261.66 --> 4263.44]  maybe
[4263.44 --> 4263.64]  it's
[4263.64 --> 4263.90]  time
