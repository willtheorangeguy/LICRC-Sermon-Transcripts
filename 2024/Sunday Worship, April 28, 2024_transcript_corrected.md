[60.00 → 89.98] Thank you.
[90.00 → 92.00] Thank you.
[120.00 → 122.00] Thank you.
[122.00 → 129.84] I said, God, I do not understand this world.
[129.84 → 134.84] Everything is dying and broken.
[134.84 → 140.78] Why do I see nothing but suffering?
[140.78 → 150.78] God, I'm asking, could this be your plan?
[150.78 → 156.58] Sin has taken hold of this whole land.
[156.78 → 162.36] Will you not say anything else to me?
[162.36 → 176.74] He said, where were you the day that I measured?
[176.74 → 187.56] Sung the bass and stretched the line over all the earth and carved out its cornerstone.
[187.56 → 201.94] Where were you the day that I spoke and told the sun to split the night open?
[201.94 → 207.62] Called the morning dawn with its light to shore.
[211.94 → 217.36] Who shot empty ocean with stone doors?
[217.72 → 222.36] Marked the reach of tides on those new shores.
[222.36 → 227.36] On the day the waves rose and first broke forth.
[231.36 → 236.24] Have you seen the springs of that crazy?
[236.24 → 241.24] Walked the caverns carved in the Black Sea?
[241.24 → 246.24] Through the gates of darkness there on its floor?
[246.24 → 253.24] Have you seen the armoury I hold?
[253.24 → 255.24] Have you seen the armoury I hold?
[255.24 → 259.24] Snow and hail are stacked up in silos.
[259.24 → 264.24] For the times of trouble and war and strife.
[264.24 → 271.24] Can you raise your voice to the storm cloud?
[271.24 → 276.24] Hold the thunder and surrender and ring out.
[277.24 → 281.24] Does the lightning ask you where it should strike?
[281.24 → 287.24] Who has cleft a channel for torrents?
[287.24 → 292.24] Reign to sprout the desert with forests?
[292.24 → 298.24] In the wilderness that my hand has filled.
[299.24 → 304.24] Can you hunt the prey for young lions?
[304.24 → 308.24] Can you lose the cords of all riders?
[308.24 → 311.24] Can you lose the cords of all riders?
[311.24 → 314.24] Is this whole world bending me?
[314.24 → 316.24] Need your will?
[319.24 → 324.24] I spoke to things I did not understand.
[325.24 → 329.24] Things too wonderful for me.
[330.24 → 334.24] Although I had no right to ask.
[334.24 → 340.24] My well brave in your Physical aliments.
[340.24 → 343.24] Don't be seen to inspire I have created.
[343.24 → 344.24] Heroic Yogis
[344.24 → 345.24] During our offspring area pupils in separation.
[345.24 → 346.92] Bunyan
[346.92 → 349.24] Can you read it?
[349.24 → 356.24] Aon przeddenant of laughing!
[356.24 → 359.24] wrote
[359.24 → 362.24] 2
[362.24 → 373.84] All my words fall short
[373.84 → 378.40] I got nothing new
[378.40 → 383.06] How could I express
[383.06 → 387.44] All my gratitude
[387.44 → 392.30] I could sing these songs
[392.30 → 396.92] As I often do
[396.92 → 402.14] But every song must end
[402.14 → 406.20] And you'll never do
[406.20 → 410.66] So I throw up my hands
[410.66 → 414.26] And praise you again and again
[414.26 → 421.12] Cause all that I have is a hallelujah
[421.12 → 425.02] Hallelujah
[425.02 → 428.80] And I know it's not much
[428.80 → 432.50] But I've nothing else fit for a king
[432.50 → 436.26] Except for a heart singing
[436.26 → 438.36] Hallelujah
[438.36 → 442.36] Hallelujah
[442.36 → 451.36] I've got one response
[451.36 → 455.42] I've got one
[455.42 → 456.22] I've got one
[456.22 → 461.22] With my arms stretched wide
[461.22 → 466.22] I will worship you
[466.22 → 470.56] So I'll throw up my hands
[470.56 → 474.22] And praise you again and again
[474.22 → 475.32] That's what I love
[475.32 → 477.38] Cause all that I have
[477.38 → 480.08] Is a hallelujah
[480.08 → 481.58] Hallelujah
[481.58 → 484.96] Hallelujah
[484.96 → 488.84] And I know it's not much
[488.84 → 492.84] But I've nothing else fit for a king
[492.84 → 496.20] Except for a heart singing
[496.20 → 498.34] Hallelujah
[498.34 → 503.04] Hallelujah
[503.04 → 528.04] Oh, don't you get shy
[528.04 → 556.04] Good morning
[556.04 → 582.06] Hey, one person. All right, let's try again. Good morning! Hey, there we go. Excellent. Welcome to worship. A special welcome if you are a guest with us this morning. My name is Chris. I'm one of the pastors here at Emanuel, and it's our privilege to gather together to worship our good God in the name of Jesus.
[582.06 → 595.38] We have a couple announcements before we begin. First, an invitation for you. This evening at 6 p.m., we are hosting a worship event that we're calling Come Holy Spirit.
[595.38 → 608.66] And we're going to gather to sing some songs and to learn about the work of the Holy Spirit in our lives and in our faith and to worship God in perhaps a new or a different way than we ordinarily do.
[608.66 → 624.38] And, so please come at 6 p.m. to worship our good God together in the power of the Spirit. If you have any questions about that, you can grab me or Pastor Kevin after the service or Sarah, who's somewhere. Sarah's on the piano. You can talk to her about it.
[624.38 → 629.52] And Robin is over there. You can talk to her about it as well. We'd love to have you join us for that.
[630.42 → 648.30] Additionally, we are in the season where we're talking about membership class and pastor's class for those of you who might want to do profession of faith or perhaps if you have not been baptized, you're thinking about baptism and professing, declaring your love for Jesus and his love for you in that way.
[648.30 → 657.58] I would love to meet you and talk to you about that. And so you can grab me at the Connect booth following our worship together. Love to have that conversation with you.
[658.68 → 666.88] I think that's all we have for announcements this morning. And so I'm going to invite you as you are able to stand. We can be ushered into the presence of God together.
[666.88 → 682.24] At this point in our service, we receive God's greeting. And that's the way that we mark that God has not only called us here and invited us here, but that by his Spirit, he carries us into his very presence.
[683.30 → 689.48] That God is here among us. And when we enter his presence, we receive from him his grace and his mercy.
[689.48 → 696.58] And he speaks his name over us as a new people. And so hear this greeting of God to you.
[696.68 → 703.30] And then as we are greeted by God, we invite you to turn to those around you and to welcome them into worship as well.
[703.70 → 706.90] Please remember, not everybody likes handshakes or hugs.
[707.68 → 712.68] And so head nods and fist bumps are perfectly acceptable ways to welcome people into worship together.
[713.30 → 714.74] Receive the greeting of our good God.
[714.74 → 727.68] Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Saviour, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[728.76 → 729.08] Amen.
[729.80 → 730.90] Let's worship God this morning.
[744.74 → 746.74] Amen.
[774.74 → 776.92] Good morning, everyone.
[777.16 → 780.94] Our call to worship this morning is from Revelations 5, where it says,
[781.50 → 783.26] And they sang a new song, saying,
[783.60 → 787.60] You are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals, because you were slain.
[788.10 → 793.62] And with your blood you purchased for God persons from every tribe, language, people, and nation.
[793.96 → 798.98] You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God, and they will reign on the earth.
[798.98 → 799.06] Amen.
[804.74 → 824.90] Come, all you people, come praise you, make them.
[824.90 → 834.16] Come all you people, come praise your name
[834.16 → 837.60] Come now and worship the Lord
[837.60 → 843.70] Come all you people, come praise your Saviour
[843.70 → 848.30] Come all you people, come praise your Saviour
[848.30 → 852.98] Come all you people, come praise the Saviour
[852.98 → 857.24] Come now and worship alone
[857.60 → 860.32] No blood you needed
[860.36 → 863.16] No place is herein'
[863.16 → 864.82] No blood you needed
[864.82 → 867.48] Correct
[867.60 → 869.32] No blood you needed
[869.32 → 871.86] No place is herein'
[871.86 → 876.40] Come now and worship alone
[876.40 → 879.16] No blood you needed
[879.16 → 881.54] Otherwise demonic
[881.54 → 890.14] Do you all in the world, come ask in line.
[890.14 → 894.14] Do you all in worship alone.
[895.74 → 899.14] Do you all in worship alone.
[911.54 → 941.52] Do you all in worship alone.
[941.54 → 971.52] Do you all in worship alone.
[971.54 → 1001.52] Do you all in worship alone.
[1001.52 → 1003.52] Do you all in worship alone.
[1003.52 → 1007.52] Do you all in worship alone.
[1007.52 → 1011.52] Do you all in worship alone.
[1011.52 → 1013.52] Do you all in worship alone.
[1013.52 → 1015.52] Do you all in worship alone.
[1015.52 → 1017.52] Do you all in worship alone.
[1017.52 → 1019.52] Do you all in worship alone.
[1019.52 → 1021.52] Do you all in worship alone.
[1021.52 → 1023.52] Do you all in worship alone.
[1023.52 → 1025.52] Do you all in worship alone.
[1025.52 → 1027.52] Do you all in worship alone.
[1027.52 → 1029.52] Do you all in worship alone.
[1029.52 → 1031.52] Do you all in worship alone.
[1031.52 → 1033.52] Do you all in worship alone.
[1033.52 → 1035.52] Do you all in worship alone.
[1035.52 → 1037.52] Do you all in worship alone.
[1037.52 → 1039.52] Do you all in worship alone.
[1039.52 → 1041.52] Do you all in worship alone.
[1041.52 → 1043.52] Do you all in worship alone.
[1043.52 → 1045.52] Do you all in worship alone.
[1045.52 → 1047.52] Do you all in worship alone.
[1047.52 → 1051.26] You may notice that it's not changed my heart any longer.
[1051.74 → 1054.24] We changed it to create in me a clean heart.
[1054.44 → 1058.02] Which is very similar thematically, lyrically, and structure.
[1058.02 → 1069.40] And while there is nothing wrong with using a song in worship two Sundays in a row, we all have to thank Linda for letting me do a last minute change.
[1069.40 → 1074.86] Because after listening to Pastor Chris' sermon last week, I had this song stuck in my head.
[1076.08 → 1083.68] The disputable matters Pastor Chris outlined for us involves things which were considered clean versus unclean.
[1083.96 → 1085.02] Holy versus not.
[1085.02 → 1091.08] The do's and the don'tTS of righteous living that were disputed upon at the time Paul wrote these passages.
[1092.32 → 1095.92] Create in me a clean heart brings up this concept of cleanliness.
[1096.38 → 1098.24] A clean, pure heart.
[1098.74 → 1106.06] Something the psalmist in Psalm 51, which this song is directly drawing its lyrics from, is petitioning God for.
[1106.06 → 1115.10] We cannot make ourselves holy through the actions we do, and yet our obedience to God, which involves how we act, is vital.
[1116.10 → 1120.30] From one of MacLaurin's expositions on the Psalms, he writes,
[1120.76 → 1127.44] God's Holy Spirit, given to a man, makes the human spirit holy, and then makes it right and free.
[1128.44 → 1131.32] It is the disposition of the heart that matters.
[1131.32 → 1135.16] What are our purposes in these disputable matters?
[1135.94 → 1137.40] The heart of God knows.
[1138.40 → 1142.32] As we will hear from Kevin about how a maturing faith leads,
[1142.98 → 1148.84] let us join our voices together once again to confess our sinful nature, our impure hearts,
[1149.40 → 1151.40] asking God to change our hearts,
[1152.06 → 1153.64] creating a clean heart within us,
[1153.64 → 1157.02] one that is right with God and free in new life,
[1157.48 → 1158.78] and from that freedom,
[1159.20 → 1163.80] lead in a way that brings others to daily confession and new life in Christ.
[1163.80 → 1172.80] break in we have realized.
[1172.80 → 1182.42] Create in me a clean heart, oh God,
[1182.42 → 1188.48] And進ic3 emailed us here and within me.
[1188.48 → 1198.28] Create in me and lead my heart, O God
[1198.28 → 1205.24] And renew the right spirit within me
[1205.24 → 1214.40] Cast me not away from thy presence, O Lord
[1214.40 → 1221.50] And take not thy Holy Spirit from me
[1221.50 → 1230.22] Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation
[1230.22 → 1237.10] And the right spirit within me
[1237.10 → 1246.20] Create in me a King, Lord, O God
[1246.20 → 1253.20] And renew the right spirit within me
[1253.20 → 1262.20] Create in me a King, Lord, O God
[1262.20 → 1269.30] And renew the right spirit within me
[1269.30 → 1278.30] Cast me not away from thy presence, O Lord
[1278.30 → 1285.30] And take not thy Holy Spirit from me
[1285.30 → 1294.40] Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation
[1294.40 → 1301.40] And renew the right spirit within me
[1301.40 → 1306.40] Create in me a King, Lord, O God
[1306.40 → 1311.50] Create in me, Lord, O God
[1311.50 → 1318.50] And renew the right spirit within me
[1318.50 → 1323.96] Please rise for our assurance from 1 John 4, 7-11
[1323.96 → 1328.92] Beloved, let us love one another
[1328.92 → 1331.14] For love is from God
[1331.14 → 1334.34] And whoever loves has been born of God
[1334.34 → 1335.78] And knows God
[1335.78 → 1339.04] Anyone who does not love does not know God
[1339.04 → 1340.72] Because God is love
[1340.72 → 1345.48] In this the love of God was made manifest among us
[1345.48 → 1348.34] That God sent his only Son into the world
[1348.34 → 1350.94] So that we might live through him
[1350.94 → 1353.18] In this is love
[1353.18 → 1355.50] Not that we have loved God
[1355.50 → 1357.10] But that he has loved us
[1357.10 → 1358.22] And sent his Son
[1358.22 → 1360.56] To be the propitiation for our sins
[1360.56 → 1363.88] Beloved, if God so loved us
[1363.88 → 1365.90] We also ought to love one another
[1365.90 → 1365.92] That he has loved us
[1366.80 → 1367.00] Amen
[1367.00 → 1369.12] Amen

[1827.04 → 1829.04] Good morning.
[1829.04 → 1832.04] Today's offering is for the Budget and the Ministry to Seafarers.
[1832.04 → 1845.04] This ministry started in 1970 by Classes BC, which was a continuation of what individuals
[1845.04 → 1848.04] in the Lower Mainland were already doing.
[1848.04 → 1851.04] In 2003, it expanded to Roberts Bay.
[1851.04 → 1857.04] The Ministry to Seafarers continues to serve seafarers by visiting ships, distributing literature,
[1857.04 → 1864.04] providing rides, gifts at Christmas, and ministering to them both on ships and at centres located
[1864.04 → 1866.04] both downtown and Roberts Bank.
[1866.04 → 1872.04] They are also supporting ministry centres in other BC ports, especially Port Alberti.
[1872.04 → 1876.04] Remember, unless otherwise noted, all gifts go to the special offering.
[1876.04 → 1878.04] Thank you.
[1881.04 → 1882.04] You're a member of the Fortune diverse community.
[1882.04 → 1885.04] You see within Helen of 1810 day on Cliff Preston, in the anal GA driven by housekeeping opportunity.
[1885.04 → 1886.04] You say everybody vertically supporting Pinch mini.
[1886.04 → 1916.02] Thank you.
[1916.04 → 1946.02] Thank you.
[1946.04 → 1948.04] Thank you.
[1976.04 → 1978.04] Thank you.
[2006.04 → 2008.04] Thank you.
[2036.04 → 2038.04] Thank you.
[2066.04 → 2068.04] Thank you.
[2068.04 → 2070.04] Thank you.
[2070.04 → 2072.04] Thank you.
[2072.04 → 2074.04] Thank you.
[2102.04 → 2103.04] Thank you.
[2103.04 → 2103.56] Okay.
[2103.56 → 2106.52] Do you guys know what we've been, can you guys recall what we've been talking about
[2106.52 → 2107.76] in children's worship time?
[2108.76 → 2109.20] No?
[2109.32 → 2111.62] Do you know what book we're busy studying right now?
[2112.04 → 2112.70] Book of the Bible?
[2113.92 → 2114.72] We'll close.
[2114.72 → 2121.00] It's actually the same book that the moms and dads and everyone else has been working
[2121.00 → 2121.12] on.
[2121.16 → 2122.24] Yeah, the book of Romans.
[2122.34 → 2123.90] We've now moved into the book of Romans.
[2124.04 → 2129.50] So last week, Pastor Kevin talked about how the Holy Spirit comes into us, right?
[2129.54 → 2134.08] And it can burst out of us like that big experiment you guys did on the lawn that we almost did
[2134.08 → 2135.34] up in front of the church.
[2135.92 → 2136.06] Yeah.
[2136.06 → 2140.94] But now we're talking about what happens moving on in your Christian life.
[2141.06 → 2144.88] So the big word we're talking about today is transformation.
[2146.18 → 2147.54] Do you guys know what that word is?
[2148.10 → 2149.06] Have you heard that word before?
[2149.30 → 2151.96] It's like when there's like a big change that happens, right?
[2151.96 → 2154.64] So there's transformation happens all over the place.
[2154.70 → 2156.40] So we have a little photo slideshow.
[2156.76 → 2164.28] I'm going to ask you guys to show your smarts and tell me what do you think the first picture
[2164.28 → 2169.18] transforms into and the second picture will show us what it transformed.
[2169.56 → 2170.44] So this is it.
[2170.50 → 2171.04] We'll start easy.
[2171.16 → 2172.18] What do you think this one turns into?
[2172.82 → 2174.18] Turns into a butterfly, right?
[2174.30 → 2179.34] It's a caterpillar that turns into a beautiful butterfly, the monarch butterfly.
[2179.68 → 2179.86] Okay.
[2179.90 → 2180.54] What about this one?
[2180.54 → 2181.92] Ooh.
[2183.16 → 2184.12] What is that?
[2184.34 → 2185.10] It's a tadpole?
[2185.56 → 2187.76] It turns into a frog.
[2188.04 → 2188.50] Good one.
[2188.92 → 2189.64] Oh, okay.
[2190.64 → 2190.96] Ooh.
[2191.38 → 2192.50] We're getting tricky now.
[2192.98 → 2194.30] What is that?
[2195.42 → 2196.74] That's a polyp.
[2197.96 → 2199.94] Do you know what a polyp turns into?
[2201.36 → 2202.20] We'll see.
[2202.38 → 2202.52] Oh.
[2203.34 → 2203.78] Oh.
[2204.12 → 2205.86] Into a giant jellyfish.
[2206.06 → 2206.80] Little polyps.
[2206.90 → 2209.44] They grow and start on the bottom of the seafloor.
[2209.44 → 2210.22] All right.
[2210.26 → 2211.40] Here's maybe we'll swing a little.
[2211.56 → 2215.38] We'll swing a little to maybe like our current pop culture stuff.
[2215.50 → 2216.26] So here we are.
[2216.34 → 2219.50] What does this guy turn into?
[2221.04 → 2221.94] A car.
[2222.18 → 2228.30] So what TV show or movie has cars that turn into?
[2228.54 → 2229.66] The movie cars.
[2229.82 → 2230.68] The movie cars?
[2230.78 → 2230.98] Oh, yeah.
[2230.98 → 2231.70] That's a good movie.
[2232.28 → 2232.68] Yeah.
[2233.18 → 2233.66] Yeah.
[2233.72 → 2235.14] What does this race car turn into?
[2235.98 → 2237.48] There are transformers.
[2237.72 → 2238.54] They're robots.
[2239.16 → 2241.52] It turns into a robot.
[2241.68 → 2245.10] This is the car Bumblebee, and he turns into a robot.
[2246.24 → 2246.80] Cool, right?
[2246.96 → 2247.08] Yeah.
[2247.28 → 2247.48] Okay.
[2247.54 → 2249.22] This next one also could be a little tricky.
[2249.60 → 2249.76] Oh.
[2250.14 → 2251.26] Do you guys know these guys?
[2251.62 → 2253.90] I think their names are Connor, Greg.
[2254.18 → 2254.34] Yeah.
[2254.42 → 2255.20] PJ Masks.
[2255.26 → 2256.14] What do they turn into?
[2256.96 → 2257.78] Cat Boy.
[2257.96 → 2258.62] Cat Boy.
[2258.62 → 2259.70] And Gecko and Palette.
[2259.74 → 2260.84] And Gecko and Palette.
[2261.00 → 2263.02] Oh, you guys are smart.
[2263.78 → 2266.24] I bet you a lot of the adults didn't know that.
[2266.36 → 2266.54] Hey?
[2267.44 → 2267.80] Yep.
[2268.72 → 2269.68] We have one last one.
[2269.72 → 2272.88] I mean, this stuff comes from the internet, so I don't even always know the answers.
[2273.02 → 2274.44] There's one last I think we have.
[2274.88 → 2275.06] Oh.
[2275.62 → 2276.06] What?
[2277.18 → 2280.90] What do we think Pastor Kevin would transform into?
[2281.94 → 2282.30] A what?
[2282.60 → 2283.38] A preacher.
[2283.86 → 2284.20] Okay.
[2284.34 → 2285.24] Any other ideas?
[2285.24 → 2287.14] A pastor?
[2287.14 → 2287.26] A preacher?
[2287.96 → 2288.40] Okay.
[2288.88 → 2289.22] Yeah.
[2289.26 → 2292.12] It would be nice if he grew up into a preacher.
[2292.70 → 2292.88] Okay?
[2293.24 → 2293.72] Yeah.
[2294.06 → 2295.06] Any other ideas?
[2295.94 → 2299.14] I don't know what the internet says, but...
[2300.32 → 2300.64] Oh.
[2301.00 → 2301.18] Yeah.
[2301.92 → 2302.44] Yep.
[2302.70 → 2303.14] Yeah.
[2304.64 → 2306.10] I mean, this is what the internet...
[2306.10 → 2309.28] You can't always believe what's on the internet, but...
[2309.28 → 2309.86] I know.
[2310.12 → 2310.62] I know.
[2311.08 → 2311.54] Yeesh.
[2311.88 → 2312.74] A clown, right?
[2313.10 → 2313.62] Yeah.
[2313.62 → 2313.66] Yeah.
[2314.04 → 2314.38] Well.
[2314.70 → 2314.96] Okay.
[2315.00 → 2317.10] We're going to talk more about transformation.
[2317.14 → 2322.18] Both the exciting ones and the silly ones and the big ones in children's worship time.
[2322.36 → 2326.90] But let's stand together with the congregation, and we'll do the children's blessing together.
[2330.00 → 2330.52] Ready?
[2331.04 → 2332.96] The Lord be with you.
[2333.32 → 2334.78] And also with you.
[2335.42 → 2349.88] Hello.
[2349.88 → 2363.44] Hello, my name is Courtney, and it is my privilege to lead you all in the church family prayer
[2363.44 → 2369.72] today. Before we begin that, there are a couple of announcements from Council. The first is that
[2369.72 → 2375.68] Judy Dijkstra is now home from a brief stay in the hospital. She's doing well and is grateful to be
[2375.68 → 2382.32] home, so praise God. And the other is from the Iron family. They will be hosting a private memorial
[2382.32 → 2390.78] service for Amy. All right, please bow your head with me and pray. Dear Heavenly Father, thank you
[2390.78 → 2396.72] for the opportunity for all of us together this morning. We praise you that Judy Dijkstra is home
[2396.72 → 2402.00] after a brief stay in the hospital. We're thankful that she is doing better and is able to be home
[2402.00 → 2410.46] again. Please be near to Ryland and Laura Benny as they lost their 86-day-old baby boy, Jack. We pray
[2410.46 → 2415.72] for peace as they navigate this new reality and that God will be very near to them during this time of
[2415.72 → 2422.76] immense loss. Be near the family of Amy Iron as she passed away last week and as they plan a memorial
[2422.76 → 2428.28] service for her. Give them peace and comfort as they grieve the loss of a wife, mother, and friend.
[2428.28 → 2435.02] Be near to Rachel Skipper as her health is continuing to decline. Give her doctors wisdom
[2435.02 → 2440.98] and bring about healing in her life. Be with Matthew, Anaya, and Ezra as this is a difficult time for the
[2440.98 → 2448.70] whole family. We pray for God's guidance and wisdom as our church council is finalizing new office bearers
[2448.70 → 2454.72] nominations. Be with those who will be stepping into office. Give them wisdom, and thank you for those who
[2454.72 → 2460.44] are completing their terms and for their diligent service. We lift those who are dealing with
[2460.44 → 2467.60] illness and ask for your healing touch upon their lives. We also lift those who are mourning the loss
[2467.60 → 2473.38] of a loved one, feeling the deep ache of their absence. Provide them with comfort and solace during this time
[2473.38 → 2480.84] of grief. Envelop them in your loving embrace. Be near to the individuals who are grappling with mental health,
[2480.84 → 2486.14] a struggle that often feels isolating and overwhelming. Shine your light into their lives,
[2486.56 → 2491.22] offering hope and a sense of your nearness. Provide them with the strength to face each day
[2491.22 → 2497.24] and the clarity to see your hand at work in their lives. Be with all the ministries that are beginning
[2497.24 → 2502.92] to wind down for the season. I pray that the ministries were impactful during this past year.
[2503.28 → 2508.64] Thank you for all the people who stepped up and volunteered and who make the ministries possible.
[2508.64 → 2514.68] Helpful the summer to be a time of rest and restoration. Be with those who are unemployed
[2514.68 → 2520.76] or underemployed. Provide clarity in their choices, ensuring that each step taken aligns with your will
[2520.76 → 2526.80] and leads them to opportunities for growth and fulfillment. We pray for those currently
[2526.80 → 2532.00] navigating conflicts, whether in personal relationships, workplaces, or broader communities.
[2532.76 → 2537.78] Fill their hearts with your love, patience, and kindness as they respond to challenging situations.
[2537.78 → 2544.82] Be with Kevin as he delivers us your word today. Bless the message. May it be your word spoken through him.
[2544.82 → 2550.22] And give us open hearts to receive the message. We pray this all in Jesus' most holy name. Amen.
[2550.22 → 2568.10] I learned today that you shouldn't make fun of Mike Prince in children's worship time, I'll tell you that.
[2569.68 → 2576.68] You know déjà vu, like something happens around you or in your context or your life that you're positive you've experienced before?
[2576.68 → 2580.42] That's a surefire way that there's a glitch in the matrix, that's for sure.
[2581.58 → 2585.38] Some of you today are going to feel a little bit of déjà vu right now,
[2585.38 → 2589.32] because today is going to seem a little bit like that from this moment on.
[2589.38 → 2595.42] That's because today we're going to be looking at the second half of Romans 14.
[2595.80 → 2601.06] So we're going to read it in a second, but at first glance it's going to be saying some very similar things
[2601.06 → 2608.66] to what we looked at last week, and that's okay. Just sort of consider this as phase two of Romans 14.
[2608.82 → 2613.94] Pastor Chris led us very well through phase one last week, and now we'll enter phase two on this topic.
[2614.04 → 2620.92] Actually, technically we're in like phase 34 of our 39 phase Romans sermon series,
[2621.12 → 2623.98] and I know this because I had to count to say those numbers.
[2623.98 → 2630.18] But either way, if this seems similar to last week, that's okay, because there are similarities.
[2631.00 → 2637.28] But I also know, and I pray that you'll be able to hear God's voice and God speak through his word this morning.
[2638.48 → 2642.02] So if you've got your Bibles, I invite you to please open those up at the moment.
[2642.12 → 2644.58] You can also turn on your Bible apps on your phone.
[2644.58 → 2649.02] You can grab a Bible from the back if you wish and turn with me to Romans 14,
[2649.02 → 2653.66] and we are going to read verses 13 through 23 this morning.
[2654.72 → 2657.36] Romans 14, 13 to 23, it says this.
[2659.00 → 2662.68] Therefore, let us stop passing judgment on one another.
[2663.56 → 2669.20] Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother or sister.
[2669.80 → 2676.24] I am convinced, being fully persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean in itself.
[2676.82 → 2682.02] But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for that person, it is unclean.
[2682.02 → 2688.26] If your brother or sister is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love.
[2689.54 → 2693.48] Do not buy your eating destroy someone for whom Christ died.
[2694.54 → 2699.00] Therefore, do not let what you know is good be spoken of as evil.
[2699.00 → 2707.06] For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.
[2708.86 → 2715.28] Because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and receives human approval.
[2715.28 → 2720.98] Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification.
[2721.40 → 2723.84] Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food.
[2724.14 → 2729.08] All food is clean, but it is wrong for a person to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble.
[2729.56 → 2736.74] It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything else that will cause your brother or sister to fall.
[2736.74 → 2742.24] So whatever you believe about these things, keep between yourself and God.
[2742.66 → 2746.28] Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself by what he approves.
[2746.96 → 2750.24] But whoever has doubts is condemned if they eat.
[2750.74 → 2752.68] Because their eating is not from faith.
[2753.40 → 2756.48] And everything that does not come from faith is sin.
[2757.16 → 2758.30] The word of the Lord.
[2758.30 → 2769.74] So last week, Pastor Chris helped us understand what Paul means when he discusses those with weak faith and those with strong faith.
[2770.30 → 2775.22] If you listen to the Welcome to the Narthex podcast, which there you go, is your shameful plug.
[2775.40 → 2776.00] Way to go, me.
[2776.36 → 2781.00] If you listen to that, Pastor Chris, Josh, and I continue to sort of flesh that out even further.
[2781.00 → 2788.84] To recap that a bit briefly, those with weak faith are not necessarily those brand new to Christianity, though that can be true,
[2789.36 → 2793.80] or those who are questioning their faith, though again that can be true.
[2794.32 → 2801.46] And those with strong faith are not necessarily those who have been a Christian all their lives, though again that can be true,
[2801.78 → 2805.48] nor are they those who never question anything about their faith.
[2805.48 → 2811.16] And dare I say, if that's true, I'd suggest they're more likely in the weak faith department.
[2812.62 → 2816.86] No, being strong in your faith means that the gospel truth of Jesus Christ,
[2817.02 → 2821.42] his life, his death, his resurrection, has taken a firm stronghold in your heart.
[2821.74 → 2826.12] And the fruits of the Spirit are evident in your life and in the world around you.
[2826.80 → 2830.94] Being weak in your faith means that the gospel truth, while still present in your life,
[2830.94 → 2836.08] is still establishing that stronghold, no matter how long you have been a believer for.
[2836.72 → 2840.06] So being strong in your faith is not about duration or comfort,
[2840.06 → 2845.18] but more about how your life reflects this righteousness, joy, and peace
[2845.18 → 2850.30] of Christ's gospel in the world around you.
[2851.04 → 2853.40] We'll look at that theme a little bit more closely today,
[2853.48 → 2855.42] but that's sort of the barometer we're working with.
[2855.42 → 2863.48] Is God's righteousness, joy, and peace on display because of the salvation you've received in Christ?
[2864.20 → 2866.14] If so, that's strong faith.
[2867.16 → 2871.06] Now, I recap that because today Paul says, sorry,
[2871.14 → 2874.36] that after hearing everything that he's written for the past 12 verses,
[2874.66 → 2877.34] now granted, Paul didn't write this letter with verses in it.
[2877.40 → 2879.32] We added those later, but you see what I'm doing here.
[2879.40 → 2881.92] Paul says, therefore, after hearing everything that I've written,
[2881.98 → 2883.94] everything that he has written over these past 12 verses,
[2883.94 → 2887.58] remember, stop passing judgment on one another.
[2888.70 → 2893.22] Basically, if there's a disputable matter at hand, just chill, everyone.
[2893.62 → 2898.62] Relax. Stop putting up barriers and obstacles in front of each other.
[2899.52 → 2900.40] Just get along.
[2903.10 → 2909.30] Today's text is about modelling Christ's righteousness, peace, and joy in your life
[2909.30 → 2910.84] to those believers around you.
[2910.84 → 2913.14] In fact, that's the big idea today.
[2913.72 → 2918.54] To model Christ means sacrificing our God-given privileges
[2918.54 → 2923.56] for the righteousness, peace, and joy of the body of Christ.
[2924.68 → 2925.86] All right, let's dig in a little.
[2927.20 → 2932.56] The first way Paul calls us to operate in community is by acting in love.
[2933.20 → 2935.94] Well, Paul uses an example of how not to act in love,
[2935.94 → 2937.10] but the point remains.
[2937.20 → 2938.30] Verse 15 there.
[2938.92 → 2942.00] If your brother or sister is distressed because of what you eat,
[2942.06 → 2944.80] you are no longer acting in love.
[2945.66 → 2947.58] Paul is using food again in this example.
[2947.66 → 2951.54] If you remember last time, some Jews in this church who have come to know Christ,
[2952.18 → 2956.64] they were still living under the belief that certain animals were unclean to eat.
[2957.34 → 2960.62] Their consciences would not let them eat certain types of meat.
[2960.62 → 2964.68] Well, many Gentiles, however, were not so concerned with that.
[2965.06 → 2965.98] They did eat meat.
[2966.46 → 2968.60] But Paul is saying that, and listen to these words,
[2968.70 → 2971.38] Paul is saying that even though he was fully persuaded,
[2971.68 → 2976.34] fully persuaded in the Lord Jesus Christ that nothing is unclean in and of itself,
[2976.44 → 2977.68] that's verse 14,
[2978.50 → 2982.80] yet if anyone regards something as unclean,
[2983.34 → 2985.04] then for that person it is unclean.
[2985.04 → 2990.38] So even though Paul knows that eating meat, a disputable matter at the time,
[2990.52 → 2992.36] was okay to consume,
[2992.72 → 2996.62] even though he was fully persuaded in the Lord Jesus Christ,
[2996.94 → 3000.16] Paul says if another brother or sister still regards this as unclean,
[3000.48 → 3002.10] if it's not good, it's not kosher,
[3002.18 → 3004.84] it's something that grinds against their moral compass,
[3005.24 → 3006.62] just don't do it with them.
[3007.24 → 3008.20] Don't eat it with them.
[3008.28 → 3009.50] Don't eat it in front of them.
[3010.40 → 3012.50] Even though nothing is unclean about it,
[3012.50 → 3015.94] for the sake of your brother or sister in Christ,
[3016.20 → 3017.64] just don't eat it with them.
[3019.08 → 3021.10] Because if you sit there and eat it with them,
[3021.14 → 3023.22] or if you try to persuade them to eat it with them,
[3023.24 → 3025.08] it goes against their moral compass,
[3025.18 → 3026.70] and that becomes a sin for them.
[3027.16 → 3028.34] Verse 23 of our text,
[3028.66 → 3031.12] whoever has doubts is condemned if they eat,
[3031.94 → 3034.36] because in their eating it is not from faith,
[3034.42 → 3036.62] and everything that does not come from faith is sin.
[3038.34 → 3040.16] And so if you find yourselves in that position,
[3040.16 → 3041.72] Paul is saying, he says don't argue,
[3041.72 → 3043.60] don't fight, don't quibble,
[3043.86 → 3047.30] don't send the latest slow cooker pulled pork recipe to them,
[3047.44 → 3048.94] don't invite them to your luau,
[3049.20 → 3051.44] don't do it, just drop it.
[3052.52 → 3056.36] Be polite, be civil, show peace,
[3057.40 → 3059.00] be a vegetarian for a meal.
[3060.28 → 3062.20] Because to do anything else
[3062.20 → 3065.22] would not be acting in love.
[3066.80 → 3069.54] The privilege to eat meat in that context
[3069.54 → 3071.58] was granted to believers by Jesus Christ,
[3071.72 → 3073.80] but even though those privileges were granted,
[3074.30 → 3075.82] Paul says not to force them
[3075.82 → 3077.42] on those who may question them,
[3077.62 → 3079.80] otherwise you might be violating their consciences
[3079.80 → 3081.82] and causing them to stumble in sin.
[3084.64 → 3086.90] Privileges aren't always meant to be taken up.
[3088.50 → 3090.04] They're privileges, they're freedoms,
[3090.16 → 3091.06] they're blessings even.
[3092.44 → 3094.78] However, sometimes those privileges are disputable.
[3094.90 → 3096.60] Some freedoms cause people to disagree,
[3096.74 → 3097.78] and it's those privileges
[3097.78 → 3100.26] that Paul says we ought to actually just put down
[3100.26 → 3101.08] every once in a while.
[3102.12 → 3103.64] We might just have to put away
[3103.64 → 3105.80] for the good of a brother or sister in Christ.
[3106.04 → 3107.54] When we don't do that,
[3108.10 → 3110.80] when we don't sacrifice our disputable privileges
[3110.80 → 3112.60] for the betterment of the body,
[3114.06 → 3116.88] beyond causing others to go against their consciences,
[3116.88 → 3118.98] Paul actually warns us of two more things
[3118.98 → 3119.60] that could happen.
[3119.60 → 3123.10] First, we could destroy the work
[3123.10 → 3124.72] that God is doing in their lives.
[3125.06 → 3126.16] Verse 20 of our text,
[3126.52 → 3128.70] do not destroy the work of God
[3128.70 → 3129.68] for the sake of food.
[3130.26 → 3131.82] And again, Paul says all food is clean,
[3131.92 → 3133.72] but it is wrong for a person to eat anything
[3133.72 → 3135.66] that causes someone else to stumble.
[3136.50 → 3139.90] God is at work in everyone's lives,
[3140.16 → 3141.22] the weak and the strong.
[3141.22 → 3144.54] If we are quick to push matters
[3144.54 → 3146.40] that may cause someone to stumble
[3146.40 → 3147.38] against their conscience,
[3148.20 → 3150.46] we could negatively be affecting,
[3150.64 → 3151.66] we could negatively affect
[3151.66 → 3153.48] what God is doing in their lives.
[3154.84 → 3157.48] Through the Spirit, God is sanctifying all of us.
[3157.82 → 3159.70] He is making us all more like Christ,
[3159.86 → 3162.84] and we are all in need of becoming more like Christ.
[3164.04 → 3166.64] And it's our job as brothers and sisters in Christ
[3166.64 → 3167.64] to help people grow,
[3167.76 → 3168.78] to edify the body,
[3168.78 → 3170.62] to encourage one another.
[3171.22 → 3174.84] But sometimes pushing things
[3174.84 → 3176.92] that people aren't ready to partake in
[3176.92 → 3179.08] can cause the opposite of growth.
[3179.52 → 3181.18] It can negatively affect
[3181.18 → 3183.78] what God is doing in the lives of other believers.
[3184.30 → 3186.96] And so Paul says not to destroy the work of God,
[3187.74 → 3189.48] especially for the sake of food.
[3190.70 → 3193.34] Don't hinder what God is doing.
[3194.76 → 3196.26] The second thing that can happen
[3196.26 → 3199.22] is we can cause disunity among the body.
[3199.22 → 3201.68] When we push people to go against their own consciences,
[3201.88 → 3204.32] we can push them away from what they believe.
[3204.40 → 3206.38] We can push them away from other believers,
[3207.22 → 3208.14] from their own faith.
[3208.44 → 3209.68] Again, in a roundabout way,
[3209.98 → 3211.36] Paul is saying when you find yourself
[3211.36 → 3212.40] in one of these situations,
[3212.64 → 3214.84] in a situation where you know you have the freedom,
[3215.10 → 3216.98] you have the privilege in Christ from this,
[3217.44 → 3219.16] but the other person doesn't see it that way,
[3219.60 → 3222.82] in a situation where a disputable matter is at hand,
[3222.82 → 3224.60] instead of asking,
[3224.96 → 3227.36] how can I enjoy my privilege at this moment?
[3228.58 → 3229.46] Ask yourself,
[3230.08 → 3232.64] what can I do here that will lead to peace
[3232.64 → 3234.86] with my brother or sister in Christ?
[3236.48 → 3239.98] What can I do here that will lead to peace at this moment?
[3241.86 → 3245.04] Don't push to try to live how you want to live,
[3245.08 → 3246.32] even if you know it's permit table.
[3246.32 → 3250.44] Ask what can I do here to bring peace into the mix
[3250.44 → 3251.58] in this situation?
[3253.08 → 3255.62] We need to follow Paul's words here in verse 19.
[3256.06 → 3258.88] Let us therefore make every effort
[3258.88 → 3262.82] to do what leads to peace and mutual edification.
[3265.32 → 3267.24] Those who are skeptical to do certain things
[3267.24 → 3269.62] because it goes against what they believe,
[3270.70 → 3272.98] sorry, what they believe is faithful living to Jesus Christ,
[3272.98 → 3275.48] they are not to violate their own consciences.
[3276.76 → 3279.76] But those who do not have those same reservations
[3279.76 → 3282.52] need to avoid encouraging those who do
[3282.52 → 3286.10] to also not violate those same consciences.
[3287.70 → 3292.72] And again, all of that applies not to command
[3292.72 → 3293.82] that we find in Scripture,
[3294.66 → 3296.78] but of course to disputable matters.
[3296.90 → 3299.14] Now, you've heard me say disputable matters
[3299.14 → 3300.42] about a half a dozen times.
[3300.42 → 3302.76] If you've been listening and checking a little box on your notes,
[3302.82 → 3303.34] it's been eight.
[3303.60 → 3304.10] I counted.
[3304.10 → 3308.18] Also last week, Chris used it a lot of times too,
[3308.26 → 3308.96] but I didn't count,
[3309.02 → 3311.04] so I don't know how many times he used the phrase
[3311.04 → 3312.18] disputable matters.
[3313.34 → 3314.56] But what are these?
[3314.70 → 3316.74] What are these disputable matters then?
[3316.84 → 3319.06] Paul talks about meat in this passage.
[3319.24 → 3321.04] Wine actually gets mentioned too.
[3321.16 → 3323.24] Last week, Pastor Chris went through a few more of them.
[3323.30 → 3326.10] He talked about a sacred day and circumcision
[3326.10 → 3327.92] and even marriage and celibacy.
[3328.02 → 3330.64] They can fit into this discussion as well.
[3330.64 → 3331.36] But there's more.
[3331.68 → 3333.44] But the more important question is,
[3333.84 → 3336.18] how do we discern what is disputable
[3336.18 → 3337.36] and what is commanded?
[3338.96 → 3341.56] That's a very important distinction for this conversation.
[3341.88 → 3343.78] Because if someone is walking in sin,
[3343.98 → 3345.26] is walking against a command,
[3345.50 → 3347.50] we do need to be able to hold up a mirror
[3347.50 → 3349.22] and help them see their sin.
[3349.36 → 3351.48] That's also part of edifying the body.
[3351.48 → 3353.90] But if someone disagrees with a privilege
[3353.90 → 3357.96] that we find and have received in Jesus Christ,
[3358.36 → 3360.22] Paul is telling us for the sake of peace
[3360.22 → 3361.86] and the work of God in their lives,
[3362.02 → 3364.38] not to push people, to just leave it.
[3365.86 → 3368.74] So how can we tell if something is a command
[3368.74 → 3370.58] or if something is disputable?
[3372.58 → 3374.62] Well, as it is most often the case,
[3374.70 → 3375.84] we can look to the Word of God.
[3375.92 → 3377.50] We can look to Scripture to help us discern
[3377.50 → 3378.52] the difference between the two.
[3378.52 → 3381.78] Now, perhaps this seems overly simple,
[3381.90 → 3382.82] but I promise you it's not.
[3382.88 → 3383.46] The truth is,
[3383.64 → 3385.30] if something is listed in the Bible
[3385.30 → 3387.78] as a command for us to do,
[3387.86 → 3388.66] for us to live out,
[3388.80 → 3390.18] and the pattern of that command
[3390.18 → 3391.78] does not change throughout Scripture,
[3392.84 → 3393.66] that's a command.
[3396.78 → 3399.20] So things like only worshipping God,
[3399.44 → 3400.10] that's a command.
[3400.22 → 3401.70] Things like loving your neighbour,
[3401.96 → 3402.54] that's a command.
[3402.66 → 3404.34] Things like not murdering people
[3404.34 → 3406.16] or not lusting after others
[3406.16 → 3408.08] or being sexually obedient
[3408.08 → 3410.46] or not coveting your neighbour's belongings
[3410.46 → 3412.56] or not stealing anything from anyone
[3412.56 → 3415.76] or by going out and serving those around you.
[3415.82 → 3417.16] Those are things that Scripture
[3417.16 → 3419.82] is consistent in from cover to cover
[3419.82 → 3422.94] in laying out what us as believers are to do.
[3423.44 → 3425.32] And again, these commands,
[3425.56 → 3427.02] these are not things we must do
[3427.02 → 3428.04] in order to be saved.
[3428.36 → 3430.10] Remember that we've learned over and over again
[3430.10 → 3431.24] throughout this book of Romans
[3431.24 → 3432.14] and throughout Scripture
[3432.14 → 3433.34] that that's not true.
[3433.38 → 3434.34] But these commands,
[3434.76 → 3436.24] Christ calls us to,
[3436.34 → 3438.06] to follow because of our gratitude
[3438.06 → 3439.74] for the new life that we have received
[3439.74 → 3441.54] in Jesus Christ's life, death, and resurrection.
[3443.46 → 3444.84] So commands exist.
[3446.30 → 3448.28] However, some like to broaden the spectrum
[3448.28 → 3449.88] of disputable matters
[3449.88 → 3452.94] to include things that shouldn't be disputed.
[3453.72 → 3455.72] But that becomes an abuse of this text.
[3456.74 → 3457.66] See, in this very letter,
[3457.74 → 3459.54] this very letter that Paul pens here,
[3459.54 → 3461.80] Paul goes over lots of ways
[3461.80 → 3462.96] that we are called to live
[3462.96 → 3465.08] and a number of sins
[3465.08 → 3466.80] that so easily entangle us.
[3467.76 → 3468.42] Sins of greed,
[3468.86 → 3469.62] sins of slander,
[3469.84 → 3471.06] sins of sexual immorality,
[3471.22 → 3472.56] sins of envious thoughts
[3472.56 → 3474.98] and actions.
[3475.34 → 3476.30] If you want a refresher,
[3476.38 → 3478.46] read Romans 1 or 2 or 3 or 4.
[3478.56 → 3478.98] They're there.
[3479.98 → 3480.48] They're clear.
[3482.40 → 3484.68] We can't make this category
[3484.68 → 3486.94] of disputable matters too broad
[3486.94 → 3488.44] lest we start going against
[3488.44 → 3490.60] the actual commands and callings of God
[3490.60 → 3492.28] that he has in our lives.
[3493.94 → 3494.42] However,
[3494.90 → 3496.26] while Scripture is consistent
[3496.26 → 3497.04] about commands
[3497.04 → 3497.96] that we are called to follow,
[3498.04 → 3499.02] there are examples
[3499.02 → 3500.66] of patterns in Scripture
[3500.66 → 3502.36] changing throughout
[3502.36 → 3504.18] the Word of God.
[3504.32 → 3505.68] And those patterns that change
[3505.68 → 3506.94] is where the disputes
[3506.94 → 3507.96] start coming in.
[3508.82 → 3509.84] Paul mentions, of course,
[3509.92 → 3510.42] in this text,
[3510.50 → 3511.80] the eating of unclean animals.
[3511.86 → 3512.34] This would have been
[3512.34 → 3514.26] very prevalent for that church in Rome,
[3514.38 → 3515.60] very prevalent for that day.
[3515.60 → 3517.68] But maybe that affects us
[3517.68 → 3518.54] a little bit less today.
[3519.86 → 3521.40] Wine, Sabbath, circumcision,
[3521.52 → 3522.78] like Pastor Chris mentioned last week,
[3522.82 → 3523.90] they all fit in this theme too.
[3524.60 → 3526.12] There are a few spots in Scripture
[3526.12 → 3527.42] where this pattern
[3527.42 → 3529.10] of what was allowed and forbidden
[3529.10 → 3530.70] seems to change over time.
[3530.88 → 3531.80] And it's those things
[3531.80 → 3532.82] that become disputable.
[3533.08 → 3534.54] That list is likely shorter
[3534.54 → 3536.20] than we think it is,
[3536.66 → 3537.56] but they are out there.
[3538.88 → 3540.42] And we need to discern them properly.
[3540.52 → 3540.82] I'm actually,
[3540.90 → 3541.38] I'm going to give you
[3541.38 → 3542.90] four examples today
[3542.90 → 3543.96] just to give us a sense
[3543.96 → 3544.96] for what kind of things
[3544.96 → 3546.00] we're looking at.
[3546.12 → 3547.36] A couple lighter ones to start.
[3547.84 → 3548.62] First, let's start,
[3548.86 → 3550.76] let's talk quickly about tattoos.
[3551.32 → 3551.50] Huh?
[3552.90 → 3554.78] Those are super popular these days.
[3555.34 → 3555.48] Right?
[3555.54 → 3556.32] Back in my day,
[3556.64 → 3558.10] tattoos were so seldomly seen
[3558.10 → 3559.10] that if someone had one,
[3559.16 → 3560.20] they stood out like a flamingo
[3560.20 → 3560.90] in a flock of pigeons.
[3561.74 → 3563.22] Now, on a sunny day,
[3563.70 → 3564.46] if you see someone
[3564.46 → 3565.22] without a tattoo,
[3565.34 → 3566.22] you have to do a double take
[3566.22 → 3567.36] to make sure they're a real person.
[3567.70 → 3568.80] They are everywhere.
[3570.38 → 3571.12] Man, do I sound old
[3571.12 → 3571.86] and crotchety there.
[3571.86 → 3574.54] To the point at hand,
[3575.08 → 3576.72] read Leviticus 19,
[3576.82 → 3578.08] verse 28 for a second.
[3579.36 → 3581.10] Do not put tattoo marks
[3581.10 → 3581.96] on yourselves.
[3582.36 → 3583.12] I am the Lord.
[3586.52 → 3587.84] That's pretty straightforward.
[3589.70 → 3590.62] Or is it?
[3592.42 → 3593.80] Deuteronomy 7, verse 6
[3593.80 → 3595.24] and 1 Peter 4, 16
[3595.24 → 3596.60] talk about being possessed
[3596.60 → 3598.00] and marked by God.
[3598.10 → 3599.52] Isaiah 44, verse 5
[3599.52 → 3600.66] even says that some
[3600.66 → 3601.58] will write on their hand,
[3601.58 → 3602.46] the Lord's,
[3602.78 → 3603.96] showing who they belong to
[3603.96 → 3604.92] as a physical mark
[3604.92 → 3607.40] of being possessed by God.
[3607.52 → 3608.96] Tattoos are often used
[3608.96 → 3610.08] by Christians nowadays
[3610.08 → 3611.76] to make that invisible mark
[3611.76 → 3613.40] of God visible.
[3614.56 → 3615.58] Tattoos like a cross
[3615.58 → 3616.50] or a Jesus fish
[3616.50 → 3617.42] or a Bible verse
[3617.42 → 3618.96] or a Hebrew or Greek word
[3618.96 → 3619.74] that I can now read,
[3620.32 → 3621.58] those are all prevalent
[3621.58 → 3624.00] on the bodies of believers
[3624.00 → 3626.00] that I personally know.
[3627.42 → 3628.20] That's not to mention
[3628.20 → 3628.80] other tattoos
[3628.80 → 3630.00] that are seemingly harmless,
[3630.00 → 3630.88] causing the question,
[3631.00 → 3632.46] was Leviticus speaking
[3632.46 → 3633.38] of all tattoos
[3633.38 → 3635.74] or just the types of tattoos
[3635.74 → 3637.18] that the surrounding nations
[3637.18 → 3637.72] of the day
[3637.72 → 3639.20] were using to show loyalty
[3639.20 → 3640.10] to their false gods?
[3641.72 → 3642.32] Now, I mean,
[3642.38 → 3643.68] wisdom still reigns in this
[3643.68 → 3644.50] no matter what, right?
[3644.50 → 3645.30] You shouldn't tattoo
[3645.30 → 3646.26] a satanic symbol
[3646.26 → 3646.92] on your body.
[3647.00 → 3647.72] That would be foolish.
[3647.84 → 3648.50] That would go against
[3648.50 → 3649.98] what God calls us to live.
[3650.02 → 3650.92] You shouldn't tattoo
[3650.92 → 3652.06] a Toronto Maple Leafs logo
[3652.06 → 3652.78] on your shoulder.
[3652.90 → 3654.32] That's like cause for concern.
[3654.62 → 3655.38] Like there's wisdom
[3655.38 → 3656.00] that dictates
[3656.00 → 3656.50] what you should
[3656.50 → 3657.08] and shouldn't do,
[3657.08 → 3657.50] of course.
[3658.74 → 3660.08] But tattoos in general?
[3662.12 → 3663.02] It's disputable.
[3664.50 → 3665.28] Or second,
[3665.42 → 3666.32] how about cosmetics?
[3666.66 → 3667.64] Things like makeup,
[3667.80 → 3668.48] perfume, jewellery.
[3668.66 → 3669.80] There are a couple spots
[3669.80 → 3670.24] in Scripture
[3670.24 → 3671.60] where the Bible
[3671.60 → 3672.40] is very adamant
[3672.40 → 3672.94] against using
[3672.94 → 3673.80] these types of things.
[3673.96 → 3675.10] Proverbs 6,
[3675.18 → 3676.36] verses 16 and 17
[3676.36 → 3676.72] says,
[3677.04 → 3678.44] haughty eyes are included
[3678.44 → 3679.02] in the things
[3679.02 → 3679.94] that God detests.
[3680.28 → 3681.48] And in 1 Timothy 2,
[3681.54 → 3681.98] 9 to 10,
[3682.28 → 3682.84] women are asked
[3682.84 → 3683.70] to dress moderately
[3683.70 → 3686.18] without elaborate hairstyles,
[3686.56 → 3687.22] without gold,
[3687.56 → 3688.34] without pearls.
[3689.46 → 3690.08] And yet,
[3690.22 → 3690.82] in Ruth,
[3691.12 → 3691.90] Ruth is praised
[3691.90 → 3693.04] for dolling herself up
[3693.04 → 3693.66] for Boaz
[3693.66 → 3694.22] in Ruth 3,
[3694.26 → 3694.72] verse 3,
[3694.90 → 3696.32] and in 2 Corinthians 2,
[3696.40 → 3696.94] verse 15,
[3697.04 → 3697.86] Paul compares us
[3697.86 → 3699.32] to a pleasing aroma
[3699.32 → 3699.96] to God,
[3700.28 → 3701.48] adorning ourselves
[3701.48 → 3703.38] for Christ our groom.
[3705.20 → 3706.24] It's disputable.
[3708.32 → 3709.38] So why does this matter?
[3709.58 → 3710.06] Well, let me tell you
[3710.06 → 3710.50] a story quick.
[3710.50 → 3713.24] There was this girl
[3713.24 → 3714.08] in high school
[3714.08 → 3714.76] who grew up
[3714.76 → 3716.18] in a fairly conservative home,
[3716.24 → 3717.16] and in that home,
[3717.30 → 3718.34] they believed
[3718.34 → 3718.84] that makeup
[3718.84 → 3720.14] kind of went against
[3720.14 → 3721.08] God's calling
[3721.08 → 3721.90] for one's life.
[3722.28 → 3723.82] This girl grew in that,
[3723.96 → 3724.94] and she grew up
[3724.94 → 3725.36] in this house.
[3725.42 → 3726.16] This house didn't push
[3726.16 → 3726.64] it is on others.
[3726.76 → 3727.20] They didn't push
[3727.20 → 3727.92] on others to believe,
[3728.18 → 3729.10] but that's what was
[3729.10 → 3729.74] true for them.
[3729.86 → 3731.06] And this girl grew up
[3731.06 → 3731.56] in this house
[3731.56 → 3732.54] and believed this
[3732.54 → 3733.60] to be true for her as well.
[3734.34 → 3735.32] One day at school,
[3735.44 → 3735.64] though,
[3735.70 → 3736.18] her friends,
[3736.24 → 3737.22] who were also Christians,
[3737.70 → 3738.80] kind of called her out on it
[3738.80 → 3740.02] and told her
[3740.02 → 3741.00] that her understanding
[3741.00 → 3741.96] of what makeup was
[3741.96 → 3742.50] was ridiculous
[3742.50 → 3743.10] and that she should
[3743.10 → 3743.62] just wear it.
[3744.88 → 3745.90] So the next morning
[3745.90 → 3746.76] on the way to school,
[3746.86 → 3747.86] she stopped by the pharmacy,
[3748.00 → 3748.60] bought some makeup,
[3748.72 → 3749.44] hid it in her locker,
[3749.60 → 3750.38] went into the bathroom,
[3750.50 → 3751.42] put it on for the morning,
[3751.96 → 3753.06] and had makeup on in school.
[3753.22 → 3754.54] But before she went home,
[3755.32 → 3756.00] she went to the bathroom
[3756.00 → 3756.66] and wiped it off.
[3757.48 → 3758.40] She couldn't go home
[3758.40 → 3759.84] and show her parents
[3759.84 → 3760.30] what she did.
[3760.98 → 3761.92] And that became the pattern.
[3762.14 → 3762.76] She would go to school
[3762.76 → 3763.30] without makeup,
[3763.52 → 3764.32] put it on for the day,
[3764.74 → 3765.22] take it off
[3765.22 → 3766.00] before she came home.
[3766.00 → 3768.88] So what's the problem here?
[3770.28 → 3771.12] Is it the makeup?
[3773.38 → 3774.22] It's not the makeup.
[3774.46 → 3775.20] It's the secrecy.
[3775.34 → 3776.02] It's the shame.
[3776.18 → 3777.22] It's the not honouring
[3777.22 → 3778.00] one's parents
[3778.00 → 3778.96] that becomes the problem.
[3779.24 → 3779.90] She clearly went
[3779.90 → 3780.84] against her own conscience
[3780.84 → 3781.82] because she felt guilty
[3781.82 → 3782.66] about doing it
[3782.66 → 3784.34] and she had to hide it
[3784.34 → 3785.26] from her folks.
[3785.36 → 3786.96] She wasn't acting in faith.
[3788.56 → 3788.82] And yet,
[3788.88 → 3789.94] you feel for her too,
[3790.02 → 3790.30] don't you?
[3790.34 → 3791.18] You feel for her
[3791.18 → 3793.80] because she was peer pressured
[3793.80 → 3794.48] into doing it
[3794.48 → 3795.36] and that peer pressure
[3795.36 → 3796.64] forced her to pick popularity
[3796.64 → 3797.66] over faithfulness.
[3798.92 → 3800.18] To this passage's point,
[3800.80 → 3801.88] her Christian friends
[3801.88 → 3803.38] ate meat in front of her
[3803.38 → 3805.36] and caused her
[3805.36 → 3806.52] to go against her conscience.
[3809.06 → 3809.86] That's what Paul's
[3809.86 → 3810.36] getting at here.
[3810.42 → 3811.02] There's a couple more
[3811.02 → 3811.70] disputable matters
[3811.70 → 3812.28] worth discussing.
[3813.02 → 3813.82] They came up
[3813.82 → 3815.74] in the Narthex podcast
[3815.74 → 3816.32] this week,
[3816.38 → 3816.90] so that's a second
[3816.90 → 3817.50] shameless plug.
[3817.58 → 3818.02] There you go.
[3819.24 → 3820.18] I'm only going to mention
[3820.18 → 3821.00] them a little bit too
[3821.00 → 3822.06] because Josh isn't going
[3822.06 → 3823.04] to let us get away
[3823.04 → 3824.14] with not talking about these
[3824.14 → 3825.20] for a while in the podcast,
[3825.32 → 3826.02] so if you want more
[3826.02 → 3826.94] in-depth analysis,
[3827.48 → 3828.10] tune in this week.
[3828.58 → 3829.20] But when speaking
[3829.20 → 3830.18] of disputable matters,
[3831.04 → 3832.28] how about infant baptism
[3832.28 → 3833.64] versus believer's baptism?
[3835.86 → 3837.16] Bible-following Christians
[3837.16 → 3837.58] and leaders
[3837.58 → 3838.64] dispute this all the time.
[3839.58 → 3839.86] In fact,
[3839.90 → 3840.42] this is probably
[3840.42 → 3840.86] the topic
[3840.86 → 3842.02] that I speak about most
[3842.02 → 3843.70] to the 16- to 30-year-old
[3843.70 → 3844.16] demographic
[3844.16 → 3844.84] of this church.
[3845.86 → 3847.34] In terms of this question,
[3847.98 → 3848.74] my question is,
[3849.36 → 3850.30] is this disputable
[3850.30 → 3851.60] in our world?
[3852.38 → 3853.24] And if it is,
[3853.28 → 3854.02] how about this question?
[3854.02 → 3854.56] And this spins it
[3854.56 → 3854.90] on its head
[3854.90 → 3855.30] a little bit.
[3855.76 → 3856.78] If infant baptism
[3856.78 → 3858.06] versus believer's baptism
[3858.06 → 3858.98] is disputable,
[3860.12 → 3861.40] is it okay
[3861.40 → 3863.90] to force a believer's baptism
[3863.90 → 3865.44] on someone
[3865.44 → 3866.12] who is baptized
[3866.12 → 3867.02] as an infant
[3867.02 → 3869.06] in order to get
[3869.06 → 3869.74] re-baptized
[3869.74 → 3870.28] as an adult?
[3873.00 → 3873.66] Especially if they
[3873.66 → 3874.16] don't want to.
[3875.90 → 3876.54] Seems to go
[3876.54 → 3877.28] against this text.
[3879.14 → 3879.90] Here's another one.
[3880.12 → 3880.50] It's going to get
[3880.50 → 3881.24] even quieter in here.
[3881.24 → 3883.08] What about women
[3883.08 → 3883.60] in office?
[3885.18 → 3886.22] Our denomination,
[3886.72 → 3888.70] I would say rightly,
[3889.56 → 3890.54] even acknowledges
[3890.54 → 3891.20] how disputable
[3891.20 → 3892.06] this topic is
[3892.06 → 3894.22] in their official stance
[3894.22 → 3894.70] on the matter.
[3894.84 → 3895.48] Scripture isn't
[3895.48 → 3896.36] as clear
[3896.36 → 3897.64] as we want it to be.
[3898.98 → 3899.58] In fact,
[3899.62 → 3900.50] one of my projects
[3900.50 → 3901.48] in seminary recently
[3901.48 → 3902.60] was to look at this topic
[3902.60 → 3903.42] of women in office
[3903.42 → 3904.80] and look at it
[3904.80 → 3905.84] from both perspectives
[3905.84 → 3906.92] as unbiasedly
[3906.92 → 3907.54] as possible.
[3907.54 → 3908.14] And so I've got
[3908.14 → 3908.72] a document
[3908.72 → 3909.78] that goes over
[3909.78 → 3911.06] the 14 passages
[3911.06 → 3911.62] in Scripture
[3911.62 → 3912.92] that are most often used
[3912.92 → 3914.28] to talk about
[3914.28 → 3914.96] women in office
[3914.96 → 3916.46] and there is a comment
[3916.46 → 3917.12] from the people
[3917.12 → 3917.84] who are for it
[3917.84 → 3918.72] and against it
[3918.72 → 3919.96] on every single one
[3919.96 → 3920.54] of those Scriptures.
[3925.14 → 3925.76] Point is,
[3925.80 → 3926.42] it's disputable.
[3928.66 → 3929.38] Timothy Keller
[3929.38 → 3930.16] sums it up nicely
[3930.16 → 3930.82] when he says this,
[3930.86 → 3931.86] if there is broad
[3931.86 → 3932.44] disagreement
[3932.44 → 3934.18] among mature,
[3935.26 → 3936.50] Bible-honouring Christians
[3936.50 → 3937.26] in some issue,
[3938.00 → 3938.90] like baptism
[3938.90 → 3940.10] or women in office,
[3940.92 → 3942.52] we must be willing
[3942.52 → 3943.34] to concede
[3943.34 → 3944.82] that it is disputable.
[3945.72 → 3946.16] However,
[3946.20 → 3947.24] if anyone wants
[3947.24 → 3948.66] to put everything
[3948.66 → 3949.98] in the disputable area,
[3950.14 → 3950.90] they need to be warned
[3950.90 → 3951.44] of the dangers
[3951.44 → 3952.18] of this tendency.
[3952.68 → 3953.02] Likewise,
[3953.62 → 3954.24] anyone who wants
[3954.24 → 3955.26] to put little or nothing
[3955.26 → 3956.56] in this disputable area
[3956.56 → 3957.82] must also be warned
[3957.82 → 3958.90] of that perspective
[3958.90 → 3959.32] as well.
[3962.02 → 3962.54] So,
[3962.82 → 3963.50] the forest
[3963.50 → 3964.96] of what is disputable
[3964.96 → 3965.92] is not maybe
[3965.92 → 3966.32] as large
[3966.32 → 3966.94] as we may think
[3966.94 → 3967.40] it is.
[3967.62 → 3968.48] Commands in the Bible
[3968.48 → 3969.40] are still commands,
[3969.56 → 3971.02] but it does contain
[3971.02 → 3972.18] certain issues
[3972.18 → 3972.66] that are still
[3972.66 → 3973.18] very,
[3973.28 → 3973.92] very central
[3973.92 → 3975.04] to the church
[3975.04 → 3975.76] found in Langley,
[3975.84 → 3976.14] B.C.
[3976.14 → 3976.84] in 2024.
[3978.10 → 3979.06] But how are we
[3979.06 → 3980.00] supposed to engage
[3980.00 → 3980.92] these matters then?
[3981.30 → 3982.00] How are we supposed
[3982.00 → 3983.22] to engage these matters
[3983.22 → 3984.24] with our fellow believers?
[3985.56 → 3986.00] And again,
[3986.44 → 3987.40] our text points us
[3987.40 → 3988.38] in a perfect direction.
[3989.40 → 3990.50] Verse 17 and 18
[3990.50 → 3991.00] of our text
[3991.00 → 3991.42] says this,
[3991.42 → 3992.62] For the kingdom
[3992.62 → 3993.40] of God
[3993.40 → 3994.76] is not a matter
[3994.76 → 3995.80] of eating and drinking,
[3996.52 → 3997.40] but of righteousness,
[3997.92 → 3998.24] peace,
[3998.58 → 3999.28] and joy
[3999.28 → 4000.34] in the Holy Spirit.
[4000.56 → 4001.44] Because anyone
[4001.44 → 4002.34] who serves Christ
[4002.34 → 4002.94] in this way
[4002.94 → 4004.78] is pleasing to God
[4004.78 → 4005.70] and receives
[4005.70 → 4006.76] human approval.
[4008.64 → 4009.56] This is interesting.
[4009.66 → 4010.82] This is the only spot,
[4011.30 → 4011.56] again,
[4011.62 → 4013.08] we're on sermon 34 now
[4013.08 → 4013.82] throughout Romans.
[4014.36 → 4014.80] We're going to have
[4014.80 → 4015.62] 39 in total.
[4015.74 → 4016.66] This is the only spot
[4016.66 → 4017.68] in the entire letter
[4017.68 → 4019.40] where Paul mentions
[4019.40 → 4020.28] the kingdom of God.
[4021.22 → 4021.92] This one spot.
[4023.50 → 4024.60] And central to the kingdom
[4024.60 → 4025.10] of God
[4025.10 → 4026.30] is the body of Christ
[4026.30 → 4027.28] and,
[4027.38 → 4028.12] to Paul's writing,
[4028.84 → 4029.44] the attributes
[4029.44 → 4030.18] of righteousness,
[4030.82 → 4031.14] peace,
[4031.40 → 4032.02] and joy.
[4033.00 → 4034.22] And so if you find yourself
[4034.22 → 4034.84] in a community
[4034.84 → 4035.40] of believers
[4035.40 → 4036.24] where these types
[4036.24 → 4036.92] of disputes
[4036.92 → 4037.58] are happening,
[4038.18 → 4039.28] the question you have
[4039.28 → 4039.98] to ask yourself
[4039.98 → 4040.52] is this,
[4040.88 → 4042.06] are you helping move
[4042.06 → 4043.12] this body of believers
[4043.12 → 4044.14] towards righteousness,
[4044.74 → 4045.04] peace,
[4045.30 → 4045.92] and joy?
[4045.92 → 4048.20] or not?
[4050.38 → 4051.20] Paul's suggestion
[4051.20 → 4052.32] is that for some things,
[4052.56 → 4054.20] these disputable things,
[4054.28 → 4055.20] one of the best ways
[4055.20 → 4055.92] you can help move
[4055.92 → 4056.94] towards righteousness,
[4057.48 → 4057.78] peace,
[4057.92 → 4058.58] and joy
[4058.58 → 4060.34] is to simply embrace
[4060.34 → 4061.00] the fact
[4061.00 → 4061.68] that you have
[4061.68 → 4062.34] different views
[4062.34 → 4064.42] and try not to force
[4064.42 → 4065.22] your beliefs
[4065.22 → 4066.12] on your brother
[4066.12 → 4066.86] or sister
[4066.86 → 4067.36] who believes
[4067.36 → 4068.02] something different.
[4068.60 → 4069.78] Even if you
[4069.78 → 4070.94] are persuaded
[4070.94 → 4072.02] in the Lord
[4072.02 → 4073.12] that you are right.
[4074.48 → 4075.52] That's Paul's words.
[4075.92 → 4078.38] The most pointed part
[4078.38 → 4078.88] of our text
[4078.88 → 4079.48] in this regard
[4079.48 → 4080.78] is the end of verse 15.
[4081.92 → 4083.18] Do not buy your eating,
[4083.70 → 4085.10] and I'm going to step out
[4085.10 → 4086.02] of the word of God
[4086.02 → 4086.52] here for a second
[4086.52 → 4087.48] and add my own little bits
[4087.48 → 4087.88] and that's why
[4087.88 → 4088.52] I'm stepping back.
[4089.20 → 4090.26] So do not buy your eating,
[4090.54 → 4091.02] and I'll add
[4091.02 → 4091.74] by your discussing
[4091.74 → 4092.96] or you're posting
[4092.96 → 4094.20] or you're texting,
[4095.20 → 4096.72] destroy someone
[4096.72 → 4098.52] for whom Christ died.
[4098.52 → 4102.40] Christ sacrificed
[4102.40 → 4103.98] his life
[4103.98 → 4105.64] for your brothers
[4105.64 → 4106.72] and sisters in Christ.
[4107.22 → 4108.26] His life.
[4109.22 → 4109.98] Christ sacrificed
[4109.98 → 4110.86] everything
[4110.86 → 4111.98] for them.
[4113.58 → 4115.18] So to model Christ
[4115.18 → 4116.42] means to sacrifice
[4116.42 → 4118.56] our God-given privileges
[4118.56 → 4120.18] for your brothers
[4120.18 → 4121.22] and sisters in Christ,
[4121.38 → 4121.88] for the good
[4121.88 → 4122.46] of righteousness,
[4123.08 → 4123.90] of peace,
[4124.06 → 4124.98] and of joy.
[4124.98 → 4127.84] So when we look down
[4127.84 → 4129.12] on weaker faith believers,
[4129.28 → 4129.96] we're harming
[4129.96 → 4131.14] the same people
[4131.14 → 4132.34] for whom Christ died.
[4133.00 → 4133.90] When we flaunt
[4133.90 → 4135.08] what we may know
[4135.08 → 4135.62] to be true
[4135.62 → 4136.20] in front of those
[4136.20 → 4137.04] who struggle to believe,
[4137.26 → 4138.14] we harm
[4138.14 → 4140.32] whom Christ died for.
[4141.14 → 4142.42] When we eat meat
[4142.42 → 4143.72] in front of believers
[4143.72 → 4144.18] who believe
[4144.18 → 4144.66] it is wrong
[4144.66 → 4145.22] to eat meat
[4145.22 → 4146.28] because of their convictions,
[4146.72 → 4148.52] we harm the same people
[4148.52 → 4150.78] whom Christ died for.
[4150.78 → 4155.04] we must treat the body
[4155.04 → 4156.56] with care and sensitivity
[4156.56 → 4158.24] because Christ paid
[4158.24 → 4159.08] with his life
[4159.08 → 4160.28] for every Christian,
[4160.72 → 4161.86] for every believer.
[4162.38 → 4164.30] Christ lived a sinless life
[4164.30 → 4165.86] that none of us can live
[4165.86 → 4167.28] only to die a death
[4167.28 → 4168.38] on a cross
[4168.38 → 4169.50] that we all deserve,
[4169.66 → 4170.40] that you deserve,
[4170.50 → 4171.16] that I deserve,
[4171.22 → 4172.26] and he did it in our place,
[4172.40 → 4173.42] and he bore the weight
[4173.42 → 4174.84] of sin and misery
[4174.84 → 4175.68] on his shoulders,
[4175.78 → 4176.52] and he took it with him
[4176.52 → 4177.08] to the tomb
[4177.08 → 4179.60] where he defeated sin
[4179.60 → 4181.08] and death once and for all
[4181.08 → 4181.80] when he rose again
[4181.80 → 4182.64] three days later.
[4184.18 → 4185.06] And he did that
[4185.06 → 4186.60] for all who believe.
[4187.98 → 4189.24] For all who believe.
[4189.30 → 4191.08] Whether they eat meat or not.
[4191.46 → 4192.50] Whether they wear jewellery
[4192.50 → 4193.82] or decide not to.
[4193.90 → 4194.98] Whether they have ink
[4194.98 → 4196.20] tattooed on their arms
[4196.20 → 4197.22] or don't.
[4197.52 → 4198.92] Whether they're egalitarian
[4198.92 → 4200.50] or complementarity.
[4201.96 → 4204.90] Christ died for all.
[4206.68 → 4208.26] Christ gave up his life
[4208.26 → 4209.28] for all of us.
[4209.60 → 4213.70] And we model Christ
[4213.70 → 4216.42] by giving up our privileges
[4216.42 → 4218.42] from Christ for others
[4218.42 → 4219.94] if they need us to.
[4220.28 → 4221.60] Peace and joy
[4221.60 → 4222.66] and righteousness
[4222.66 → 4224.20] and spiritual growth
[4224.20 → 4225.26] and encouragement
[4225.26 → 4226.84] matter so much more
[4226.84 → 4228.02] than the disputable matters.
[4230.14 → 4231.20] I'll conclude
[4231.20 → 4232.36] with just some final thoughts here.
[4233.28 → 4236.06] First, verse 22 of our text
[4236.06 → 4237.20] offers one more,
[4237.42 → 4239.56] I think, very good application.
[4239.60 → 4240.26] for us today.
[4241.26 → 4241.72] It says,
[4241.86 → 4242.74] whatever you believe
[4242.74 → 4243.58] about these things,
[4243.74 → 4244.68] these disputable matters,
[4244.80 → 4245.42] whatever you believe
[4245.42 → 4246.24] about these things,
[4246.48 → 4248.18] keep them between yourself
[4248.18 → 4248.70] and the Lord.
[4249.70 → 4250.90] Keep them between yourself
[4250.90 → 4251.34] and God.
[4252.48 → 4253.18] Paul is saying
[4253.18 → 4253.96] there's a difference
[4253.96 → 4255.50] between belief and action.
[4256.56 → 4257.12] You're allowed
[4257.12 → 4257.94] to have your convictions.
[4258.78 → 4259.24] You're allowed
[4259.24 → 4259.92] to even know
[4259.92 → 4260.96] to the core of your body
[4260.96 → 4261.64] that your convictions
[4261.64 → 4262.22] are true
[4262.22 → 4263.28] and that the privileges
[4263.28 → 4264.30] of those convictions
[4264.30 → 4264.92] in Christ
[4264.92 → 4265.68] are good.
[4266.96 → 4269.32] But not every private conviction
[4269.32 → 4270.78] needs to be public discourse.
[4273.24 → 4274.12] In a world
[4274.12 → 4275.14] of online forums,
[4275.46 → 4276.42] not every thought
[4276.42 → 4277.28] needs to be posted
[4277.28 → 4280.24] and not every post
[4280.24 → 4280.92] needs a comment.
[4282.18 → 4283.12] Keep those things
[4283.12 → 4283.96] between you and God.
[4285.30 → 4286.74] Help establish peace
[4286.74 → 4287.52] and joy
[4287.52 → 4288.46] among your brothers
[4288.46 → 4289.50] and sisters in Christ.
[4289.50 → 4291.56] And second,
[4291.66 → 4292.16] if you know
[4292.16 → 4292.98] that an issue
[4292.98 → 4293.64] is disputable,
[4293.76 → 4294.52] if we know,
[4294.60 → 4295.16] if we're aware
[4295.16 → 4296.28] of a disputable issue,
[4297.16 → 4298.16] and then we are called
[4298.16 → 4299.24] to proper discussion
[4299.24 → 4299.84] and discernment.
[4299.92 → 4300.42] We are called
[4300.42 → 4302.22] to follow Paul's advice here.
[4302.30 → 4303.46] Those who may be weaker
[4303.46 → 4304.14] in their faith,
[4304.34 → 4305.08] they must be willing
[4305.08 → 4306.56] to really truly review
[4306.56 → 4307.88] the biblical data
[4307.88 → 4309.40] and be open,
[4309.46 → 4309.58] sorry,
[4309.64 → 4310.16] to rethinking
[4310.16 → 4310.86] their position
[4310.86 → 4312.96] and refuse to criticize
[4312.96 → 4313.84] those who disagree.
[4315.20 → 4315.96] But likewise,
[4316.46 → 4317.38] those who may be stronger
[4317.38 → 4317.88] in their faith
[4317.88 → 4318.86] must also be willing
[4318.86 → 4320.16] to review the biblical data,
[4320.48 → 4321.72] to rethink their position,
[4322.04 → 4322.70] and be willing
[4322.70 → 4323.70] to curb their freedoms
[4323.70 → 4324.94] and privileges in Christ
[4324.94 → 4326.80] to avoid discouraging
[4326.80 → 4328.18] and harming fellow believers.
[4329.14 → 4330.04] It's okay to talk.
[4330.64 → 4331.58] It's good to talk.
[4331.66 → 4332.50] It's good to discuss
[4332.50 → 4333.14] these topics.
[4333.48 → 4335.42] But we must do so
[4335.42 → 4337.12] with peace and joy
[4337.12 → 4337.92] in our mouths.
[4338.48 → 4339.78] Not seeking to win,
[4341.08 → 4342.08] but seeking to obey,
[4342.38 → 4343.26] seeking to encourage,
[4343.42 → 4344.14] seeking to edify
[4344.14 → 4344.76] one another.
[4347.88 → 4348.68] And if those discussions
[4348.68 → 4349.56] aren't done with the spirit
[4349.56 → 4350.12] of peace and joy,
[4350.18 → 4350.56] then once again,
[4350.60 → 4351.26] just keep them between
[4351.26 → 4351.76] you and God
[4351.76 → 4354.24] for the sake of the body,
[4355.14 → 4357.28] for the sake of Christ's love
[4357.28 → 4358.84] and sacrifice for us all.
[4359.84 → 4360.58] That way,
[4360.90 → 4361.92] the whole body
[4361.92 → 4363.62] can grow in righteousness,
[4363.96 → 4364.96] we can grow in peace,
[4365.02 → 4365.92] we can grow in joy,
[4365.96 → 4366.54] and we can let
[4366.54 → 4367.80] the work of the Spirit,
[4367.92 → 4369.70] who is sanctifying us all
[4369.70 → 4370.28] right now,
[4371.32 → 4372.38] continue His work
[4372.38 → 4372.94] of renewal
[4372.94 → 4374.40] in all of our lives.
[4374.48 → 4374.66] Amen?
[4374.66 → 4374.78] Amen?
[4374.78 → 4376.38] Let me pray.
[4380.38 → 4381.36] Father in heaven,
[4381.98 → 4382.60] we thank You
[4382.60 → 4383.18] for Your Word.
[4383.66 → 4384.14] We thank You
[4384.14 → 4384.76] for this letter
[4384.76 → 4386.30] that Paul has penned
[4386.30 → 4387.14] to the Roman church
[4387.14 → 4390.16] and that Your words
[4390.16 → 4391.10] are on its page.
[4392.36 → 4392.62] And God,
[4392.66 → 4393.18] we pray
[4393.18 → 4394.68] in the context
[4394.68 → 4395.70] that we find ourselves,
[4395.82 → 4396.52] which is a very
[4396.52 → 4397.50] polarizing culture,
[4398.44 → 4399.44] a culture that loves
[4399.44 → 4399.98] disputes,
[4401.02 → 4401.96] a culture that loves
[4401.96 → 4402.62] to be upset
[4402.62 → 4403.26] with one another.
[4404.52 → 4404.76] God,
[4404.84 → 4405.72] we pray that You
[4405.72 → 4406.78] will give us Your heart
[4406.78 → 4407.64] in these matters.
[4408.46 → 4408.64] Lord,
[4408.70 → 4409.30] in the areas
[4409.30 → 4410.48] of disputable matters,
[4411.12 → 4411.98] where things are a little
[4411.98 → 4412.62] maybe murkier
[4412.62 → 4413.52] than we want them to be,
[4415.18 → 4415.40] God,
[4415.46 → 4416.50] will You give us humility,
[4417.22 → 4418.02] give us peace
[4418.02 → 4420.10] to not step
[4420.10 → 4421.42] too boldly
[4421.42 → 4423.16] or passionately
[4423.16 → 4423.88] in front of those
[4423.88 → 4425.02] who these topics
[4425.02 → 4425.86] are a little bit more
[4425.86 → 4427.54] challenging to understand.
[4429.22 → 4429.60] God,
[4429.64 → 4430.34] we pray for wisdom
[4430.34 → 4431.08] and discernment
[4431.08 → 4432.08] in these conversations.
[4432.08 → 4432.98] We pray for wisdom
[4432.98 → 4433.50] and discernment
[4433.50 → 4434.28] in the relationships
[4434.28 → 4435.54] of our brothers
[4435.54 → 4436.32] and sisters in Christ
[4436.32 → 4437.12] where we may disagree
[4437.12 → 4438.20] on certain things.
[4438.30 → 4438.44] God,
[4438.48 → 4439.28] may Your peace reign.
[4440.38 → 4441.20] May we encourage
[4441.20 → 4441.58] one another.
[4441.70 → 4442.52] May we edify
[4442.52 → 4443.18] one another.
[4443.92 → 4444.86] And may Your Holy Spirit
[4444.86 → 4445.68] continue to work
[4445.68 → 4446.40] in our hearts
[4446.40 → 4447.30] to draw us closer
[4447.30 → 4448.40] and closer to You.
[4451.06 → 4451.74] And God,
[4451.86 → 4452.58] may love
[4452.58 → 4454.54] for one another
[4454.54 → 4455.98] trump any dispute
[4455.98 → 4456.70] that we may have.
[4458.04 → 4458.80] We pray this
[4458.80 → 4459.34] in Your Son's
[4459.34 → 4460.26] precious and holy name.
[4460.68 → 4460.92] Amen.
[4460.92 → 4461.00] Amen.
[4462.08 → 4462.64] Thank you.
[4462.78 → 4462.98] Thank you.
[4463.06 → 4465.42] Bye.
[4465.42 → 4466.22] Bye.
[4466.22 → 4466.56] Bye.
[4466.56 → 4466.58] Bye.
[4467.82 → 4468.54] Bye.
[4470.04 → 4470.32] Bye.
[4470.80 → 4471.16] バイバイ.
[4474.02 → 4474.24] Bye.
[4480.18 → 4480.76] Bye.
[4480.82 → 4481.12] Bye.
[4485.74 → 4485.84] Bye.
[4485.84 → 4502.40] We're pilgrims on the journey of a narrow road
[4502.40 → 4507.92] And those who've gone before us slide away
[4507.92 → 4516.56] Cheering on the faithful, encouraging the weary
[4516.56 → 4524.82] Their lives a stirring testament to God's ascending grace
[4524.82 → 4530.68] Surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses
[4530.68 → 4538.32] Let us run the race not only for the prize
[4538.32 → 4542.86] Let us those who've gone before us
[4542.86 → 4546.28] Let us leave to those behind us
[4546.28 → 4554.40] The heritage of faithfulness has gone through God in us
[4554.40 → 4560.30] Oh, may all who've come behind us find us faithful
[4560.30 → 4567.40] May the fire of our devotion light their way
[4567.40 → 4575.04] May the footprints that we leave lead them to redeem
[4575.04 → 4580.40] And the lives we live inspire them to obey
[4580.40 → 4588.30] Oh, may all who've come behind us find us faithful
[4588.30 → 4603.30] After all our hopes and dreams have come and done
[4603.30 → 4609.20] Our children sit through all we've got behind
[4609.20 → 4614.12] May the clues that they discover
[4614.12 → 4617.62] And the memories they uncover
[4617.62 → 4625.20] May the light that leads them to the road we reach us one
[4625.20 → 4633.10] Oh, may all who've come behind us find us faithful
