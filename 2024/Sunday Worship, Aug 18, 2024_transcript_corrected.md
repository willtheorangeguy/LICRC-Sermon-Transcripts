[0.00 → 11.28] Awaken it for this moment, for this hour.
[13.28 → 20.18] Awaken it for you and you alone.
[20.18 → 26.34] Awake my soul, awake my soul.
[26.34 → 31.94] And sing for the world you love.
[32.46 → 39.52] That your will be done, that your will be done in me.
[39.52 → 43.78] For you and you alone.
[44.30 → 49.74] Awake my soul, awake my soul.
[50.20 → 55.42] And sing for the world you love.
[55.42 → 63.18] That your will be done, that your will be done in me.
[63.18 → 93.18] 
[93.18 → 100.94] Awaken it for you and you alone.
[100.94 → 108.70] I hear your voice and this is my awakening.
[108.70 → 116.46] Awaken it for you and you alone.
[116.46 → 121.46] Awaken it for you and you alone.
[121.46 → 131.22] Awaken it for you and you alone.
[131.22 → 135.22] Awaken it for you and you alone.
[135.22 → 152.22] Awake my soul
[152.22 → 169.22] Awake my soul
[169.22 → 175.22] And soon from the darkness comes a light
[175.22 → 178.22] Awake my soul
[178.22 → 181.22] Awake my soul
[181.22 → 187.22] And sing like the rising sun that shines
[187.22 → 190.22] Awake my soul
[190.22 → 193.22] Awake my soul
[193.22 → 199.22] And soon only you can raise a light
[199.22 → 202.22] Awake my soul
[202.22 → 205.22] Awake my soul
[205.22 → 209.22] And sing like the rising sun that shines
[209.22 → 225.22] In our hearts, Lord, in the nations
[225.22 → 230.22] Awake my soul
[230.22 → 248.22] Awake my soul
[248.22 → 253.22] It's time
[253.22 → 270.82] It's time for the reign of God. It's time for your light to shine. It's time for the kingdom of our God to be revealed.
[270.82 → 285.56] It's time for authority. It's time for your majesty. It's time for the kingdom of our God to be revealed.
[285.56 → 300.56] It's time for the reign of God. It's time for your light to shine. It's time for the kingdom of our God to be revealed.
[300.82 → 315.98] It's time for authority. It's time for your majesty. It's time for the kingdom of our God to be revealed.
[317.86 → 329.06] In these days of wars and famines, in these days when hearts grow cold, in these days of growing darkness,
[329.06 → 340.48] there's a story to be told. So we gather in the spirit. We lift the prayer of faith.
[340.48 → 349.48] We proclaim the mighty word of God, the power in your name.
[350.56 → 364.34] It's time for the reign of God. It's time for your light to shine. It's time for the kingdom of our God to be revealed.
[364.34 → 381.34] It's time for the kingdom of our God to be revealed.
[381.34 → 383.34] We're a castle of rebellion.
[383.34 → 396.22] We're a castle of rebellion. Addicted and deceived. For those who wander far from home. It's time to intercede.
[396.22 → 400.78] So we gather in the spirits
[400.78 → 404.30] We lift the prayer of faith
[404.30 → 408.98] We proclaim the mighty word of God
[408.98 → 412.66] The power in your name
[412.66 → 416.48] The power in your name
[416.48 → 422.20] It's time for the praise of God
[422.20 → 425.96] It's time for your light to shine
[425.96 → 430.68] It's time for the kingdom of our God
[430.68 → 432.18] Be revealed

[445.66 → 447.22] Be revealed
[447.22 → 452.32] It's time for the reign of God

[470.66 → 475.38] It's time for the kingdom of our God
[475.38 → 480.10] To be redeemed
[480.10 → 481.60] It's time for you
[481.60 → 483.60] It's time for you
[483.60 → 485.30] Oh yeah
[485.30 → 486.18] Oh yeah
[486.18 → 487.10] Oh yeah
[487.10 → 492.10] It's time for you
[492.10 → 493.10] It's time for you
[493.10 → 505.48] It's time for love and justice
[505.48 → 519.44] It's time for love and justice
[519.44 → 524.16] It's time for the kingdom of our God
[524.16 → 528.16] It's time for the kingdom of our God
[528.16 → 529.66] To serve again
[529.66 → 530.16] It's time for the kingdom of our God
[530.16 → 531.78] To serve again
[531.78 → 532.16] Oh yeah
[532.16 → 533.16] Oh yeah
[533.16 → 534.16] Oh yeah
[534.16 → 536.16] Oh yeah
[536.16 → 553.86] Oh yeah
[556.02 → 560.10] Oh yeah
[560.10 → 573.78] Come, now is the time to worship.
[575.78 → 583.64] Come, now is the time to give your heart.
[583.64 → 592.40] Come, just as you are to worship.
[594.40 → 602.46] Come, just as you are before your God.
[603.94 → 604.52] Come.
[608.20 → 612.62] One day every tongue will confess you are God.
[612.62 → 616.28] One day every knee will bow.
[617.72 → 626.50] Still the greatest treasure remains for those who gladly choose you now.
[629.12 → 636.44] Come, now is the time to worship.
[636.44 → 646.32] Come, now is the time to give your heart.
[647.96 → 654.94] Come, just as you are to worship.
[654.94 → 665.32] Come, just as you are before your God.
[666.32 → 667.36] Come.
[671.32 → 674.98] One day every tongue will confess you are God.
[674.98 → 676.80] Good morning.
[679.08 → 682.02] I don't know if you saw, but I almost ate it on the way up the stairs here.
[682.16 → 683.54] So it's going to be a good morning.
[684.14 → 685.56] Welcome to, yeah, I know you saw it.
[685.58 → 685.92] Thank you.
[686.30 → 686.84] Welcome to worship.
[686.90 → 688.56] If you're a guest with us, my name is Chris.
[688.74 → 690.14] I'm one of the pastors here.
[690.14 → 697.62] And it's my privilege to share with you in our worship this morning to lead you as we encounter God in this space together.
[697.62 → 704.90] Before we begin, I got a bunch of announcements because some are starting to wrap up and that means things are starting to happen again.
[705.04 → 708.76] And so bear with me as I plow through these.
[709.90 → 719.38] First, this evening at 7 p.m., we are hosting a special worship service called Lament and Longing.
[719.38 → 731.32] It's an opportunity to gather together and to worship our God in the midst of the chaoses and the turmoils and the grief and the mourning that we may be experiencing right now in our lives.
[731.36 → 735.58] We want to take that and just bring it into the presence of God together.
[735.76 → 738.44] And so we're going to gather for a special worship service.
[738.52 → 742.00] It's going to be in the foyer over there at 7 p.m.
[742.62 → 745.54] Encourage you to join us for that time together.
[745.54 → 751.66] If you have any questions about that, you can get me or Pastor Kevin after the service, and we'll gladly address those for you.
[752.94 → 758.76] Also, following our worship today, when we gather for coffee and hanging out in the back there,
[759.12 → 771.04] at the Connect booth, there will be a laptop so that you can most quickly and expediently sign up to volunteer helping at Reactivate.
[771.82 → 775.28] So Reactivate is a youth conference that we host in September.
[775.54 → 779.24] And we need a bunch of volunteers to fill spots and holes.
[779.42 → 789.30] And to make that as easy as possible, Kevin and maybe even Rachel will meet you at the back and help sign you up for different responsibilities and time slots and the like.
[789.38 → 791.10] And so you can grab them there.
[792.72 → 797.72] I'm going to keep moving through today after our service here.
[798.24 → 800.94] We have some work that's happening in the sanctuary this week.
[800.94 → 808.62] And so if you're feeling strong and helpful, we need to stack these chairs and kind of move them around the outside.
[808.76 → 811.14] Dave's going to coordinate that at the end of our service.
[811.34 → 816.18] And so after coffee, after hanging out together, if you can just start piling chairs up,
[816.44 → 821.06] that would be super helpful for the kinds of things that are going to happen this week in this space.
[821.06 → 823.38] I'm going to keep going.
[823.38 → 833.16] On Tuesday evening this week at the Alchemist House, there's a gathering where we have the chance to meet together with Jody Gonzalez,
[833.44 → 836.58] who's a missionary that we support, who's a member of this church.
[837.12 → 839.76] She's a missionary in Tijuana and Rosarito.
[839.98 → 845.82] And she is in town and would love to meet with you if you'd like to connect with her and hear how things are going.
[845.82 → 849.94] Rob is here representing the Alchemists and Aaron is on the drums.
[850.18 → 854.32] So if you need to learn where their house is, grab them and they will tell you.
[854.40 → 858.54] That's Tuesday night from 7.30 to 9 o'clock at their place.
[859.44 → 860.78] All right, I'm going to keep going.
[863.40 → 873.08] On Labour Day weekend Monday, September 1st, we are going to host another, we're calling it this year, Meet the Topes.
[873.08 → 876.42] And so our baseball team is the Isotopes.
[876.56 → 882.20] Last year we played Beat the Topes, but we won two tournaments this year, so you all aren't going to beat us.
[882.76 → 884.94] Instead, we've offered for you to meet us.
[885.32 → 889.74] So we're going to have a baseball day together after church on the Labour Day weekend.
[890.22 → 894.92] If you want to sign up for that, again, Kevin and Aaron will get you connected.
[895.16 → 896.26] More details to come.
[896.26 → 902.50] But we'd love to hang out and have a barbecue or some fellowship time together, a potluck rather, on that Sunday.
[903.08 → 904.12] And we'll hang out there.
[905.22 → 910.08] Lastly, on, make sure I get this right, October 19.
[910.34 → 913.26] And now I know that's a long time away, but that's a Saturday.
[913.86 → 921.14] October 19, we are hosting an AED and CPR level C first aid class.
[922.30 → 926.30] And you're going to have a three-year certificate that comes out of that.
[926.40 → 927.50] And Heather is here.
[928.00 → 929.12] She's in charge of that.
[929.12 → 939.86] If you would like to sign up and register to participate that, we need at least six more interested people, or five more, because I said I would be interested in that.
[939.98 → 942.12] Talk to Heather, and we'll make sure that that happens.
[942.22 → 947.70] And that way we have people trained here in case of emergencies, or at least particular types of emergencies.
[947.76 → 955.68] Talk to Heather today, if you couldn't hear her, because she has to book it with Request Technologies.
[955.68 → 957.60] All right.
[957.82 → 959.14] I think that's it.
[959.60 → 960.66] Kevin, did I miss anything?
[961.70 → 962.26] Anyone else?
[962.34 → 963.00] Did I miss anything?
[964.30 → 964.96] All right.
[965.00 → 966.86] If I missed something, you'll hear about it next week.
[967.44 → 970.66] Can we stand together as we're welcomed into God's presence?
[970.66 → 979.86] We gather in this place because God calls us, and he meets us, and we mark that by receiving his greeting.
[980.08 → 987.96] Following the greeting that we receive from God, I invite you to turn to those around you and to welcome them, to greet them in the name of the Lord as well.
[988.30 → 990.24] Receive the blessing of our God.
[990.24 → 1002.20] Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, and our Saviour, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[1003.14 → 1003.48] Amen.
[1003.48 → 1003.62] Amen.
[1020.24 → 1044.18] Our call to worship this morning comes from Revelation 19, verses 6 and 7.
[1044.18 → 1054.12] Then I heard what sounded like a great multitude, like the roar of rushing waters and like loud peals of thunder, shouting,
[1054.76 → 1058.20] Hallelujah, for our Lord God Almighty reigns.
[1058.64 → 1067.70] Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory, for the wedding of the Lamb has come, and his bride has made herself ready.
[1067.70 → 1067.80] Amen.
[1074.18 → 1075.18] Amen.
[1104.18 → 1105.18] Amen.

[1184.82 → 1186.82] Amen.

[1332.82 → 1336.82] I will praise you

[1372.82 → 1378.82] I will give you all my praise
[1378.82 → 1382.82] You alone I long to worship
[1382.82 → 1386.82] You alone are worthy of my life
[1386.82 → 1388.82] I will bow down
[1388.82 → 1392.82] I will bow down
[1392.82 → 1394.82] I will bow down
[1394.82 → 1398.82] And I'll hail you as King
[1398.82 → 1400.82] And I'll hail you as King

[1412.82 → 1416.82] I will lift
[1416.82 → 1418.82] I will lift
[1418.82 → 1420.82] My eyes to your throne
[1420.82 → 1422.82] My eyes to your throne
[1422.82 → 1424.82] My eyes to your throne
[1424.82 → 1426.82] Your throne
[1426.82 → 1442.82] I will trust you
[1442.82 → 1445.82] I will trust you
[1445.82 → 1446.82] I will trust you alone

[1487.18 → 1493.26] You alone I long to worship
[1493.26 → 1501.90] I'm reading from a book called Sunday, one that I actually got from my mom, and it has devotions on Sunday.
[1501.90 → 1505.34] This is words from Paul Tripp.
[1505.34 → 1535.34] 
[1535.34 → 1565.34] 
[1565.34 → 1568.62] Protecting, providing, rescuing, and guiding.
[1568.62 → 1574.70] It is a good thing to be reminded again and again that we cannot hide from him.
[1575.86 → 1585.14] Corporate worship is an invitation to come out of hiding and to bask in the beauty of knowing and being known by God,
[1585.14 → 1590.36] a beauty that is ours because of his redeeming grace.
[1591.02 → 1592.22] Let's pray together.
[1592.22 → 1600.66] Father God, we come to you this morning basking in your beauty and your presence.
[1600.66 → 1610.52] We thank you, Lord, that even though we don't deserve this presence, that you come to us, and you rescue us from all of our sin and our destruction.
[1611.96 → 1617.34] Thank you for your grace, for your love, and for your mercy in our lives.
[1618.04 → 1620.02] We pray this in Jesus' name.
[1621.02 → 1621.34] Amen.
[1621.34 → 1621.48] Amen.
[1623.08 → 1626.90] Please stand as we continue in worship singing Ancient of Days.
[1626.90 → 1633.72] Amen.

[1951.80 → 1954.32] We are the one game, given a temple, when you are the name in the description.
[1954.92 → 1956.32] Old at the top of God's house, displayed in my heart, for our Father's love.
[1956.32 → 1960.72] and pay the cost.

[2087.32 → 2094.00] We'll see your face bright as the sun.
[2094.00 → 2101.06] We'll bow before the King of kings.
[2101.06 → 2103.06] Oh, God.
[2103.06 → 2107.06] Forever we will sing.
[2107.06 → 2113.06] Behold the Lamb.

[2151.06 → 2152.06] We sing your praise.
[2152.06 → 2157.10] And lets hallelujah to your holy name.
[2157.10 → 2159.10] Jesus, you will reign forevermore.
[2159.10 → 2162.10] Jesus, you will reign forevermore.
[2162.10 → 2165.10] The victory is yours.
[2165.10 → 2168.14] You reign forevermore.
[2168.14 → 2171.10] The victory is yours.
[2171.10 → 2174.10] Jesus reigns forevermore.
[2174.10 → 2176.10] The victory is yours.
[2176.10 → 2181.10] The victory is yours.
[2181.10 → 2183.10] Let me have a seat.
[2183.10 → 2184.10] Let me have a seat.
[2191.10 → 2192.10] Good morning.
[2192.10 → 2194.10] My name is Mike and I serve as a deacon here at the church.
[2194.10 → 2200.10] And this morning we have a chance to give of our gifts for the Friendship Ministries.
[2200.10 → 2209.22] This is a partner ministry of the CRC Church that works to share the love of Christ with people who have special needs or special disabilities.
[2209.96 → 2215.62] And they also work with churches to help create a welcoming space for people with some of those special needs.
[2216.12 → 2220.74] And I actually grew up in a church that had a very vibrant community-based friendship ministry.
[2220.74 → 2234.38] So it has a special place in my heart because the level of vulnerability and exuberance and hospitality that took place at their meetings or when they would lead a Sunday service was something very special.
[2234.72 → 2237.02] So thank you for giving this morning to this ministry.
[2250.74 → 2280.72] Thank you.
[2280.74 → 2282.74] Thank you.
[2310.74 → 2312.74] Thank you.
[2312.74 → 2316.74] Thank you.
[2320.74 → 2329.74] Thank you.
[2329.74 → 2333.84] Your hand of love saves you, heal me.
[2333.84 → 2337.34] I am weak.
[2338.08 → 2342.34] I need your love to bring me.
[2342.60 → 2346.04] Oh, Lord, my love.
[2346.64 → 2354.74] My saving weakness will rescue me.
[2354.74 → 2360.70] Oh, Lord, you are my soul.
[2360.70 → 2366.54] Your voice never fails me.
[2366.88 → 2369.28] And my need to come.
[2369.68 → 2374.30] We can follow you forever.
[2375.32 → 2378.88] For you are good.
[2379.38 → 2383.20] For you are good to me.
[2383.20 → 2385.38] For you are good.
[2387.56 → 2390.00] For you are good.
[2391.50 → 2393.80] For you are good.
[2394.16 → 2396.08] For you are good.
[2396.36 → 2400.48] For you are good to me.
[2400.86 → 2402.62] For you are good.
[2402.72 → 2404.94] For you are good.
[2404.94 → 2410.02] For you are good to me.
[2410.02 → 2424.78] I'm keeping this one, Dave.
[2425.86 → 2429.70] Kids, can I invite you to come on down to the front here?
[2429.78 → 2432.32] If you are three years old up to kindergarten,
[2432.44 → 2434.86] you can come on up and join me up here for a minute.
[2434.86 → 2436.82] It would be great to see you.
[2440.02 → 2445.54] Good morning, everyone.
[2446.90 → 2448.06] How are we doing this morning?
[2449.50 → 2449.86] Good?
[2449.98 → 2451.30] We're going to whisper this morning, yeah?
[2451.34 → 2452.16] We'll be whisperers.
[2453.58 → 2454.72] You guys had a good week?
[2455.62 → 2457.28] Are you ready to go to children's worship time?
[2457.82 → 2458.02] Yeah?
[2458.16 → 2458.36] Okay.
[2458.78 → 2461.74] Let me pray, and then we'll head on off to children's worship time.
[2461.78 → 2463.12] We'll do the blessing after I pray, okay?
[2463.54 → 2463.80] Deal?
[2464.98 → 2465.34] Deal.
[2465.64 → 2466.34] All right, let's pray.
[2466.70 → 2468.18] Father God, thank you so much for this day.
[2468.18 → 2469.80] Thank you that we could come to church this morning.
[2470.20 → 2473.16] Praise your name and learn more about what it means to follow you.
[2473.94 → 2476.46] We pray for these kids right now as they go to children's worship time
[2476.46 → 2478.74] and for the grownups as they stay here in the sanctuary, Lord.
[2478.98 → 2482.38] Pray that you will help us open up our hearts and our ears
[2482.38 → 2483.66] to what it is you want to teach us today.
[2483.76 → 2484.62] We pray this in your name.
[2485.28 → 2485.64] Amen.
[2486.54 → 2487.42] All right, should we stand?
[2488.06 → 2489.40] And we're going to do the Lord's blessing.
[2489.48 → 2490.92] Everybody else stand two, please.
[2491.30 → 2493.18] We're going to say the Lord be with you together.
[2493.28 → 2493.72] Are you ready?
[2494.40 → 2495.78] One, two, three.
[2495.78 → 2495.82] One, two, three.
[2500.02 → 2502.10] All right, you can head on down to children's worship time.
[2502.58 → 2502.94] All right.
[2502.94 → 2503.40] All right.
[2503.40 → 2503.98] All right.
[2503.98 → 2506.16] You can head on down to children's worship time.
[2506.16 → 2521.18] Good morning.
[2521.18 → 2521.22] Good morning.
[2521.72 → 2522.86] My name is Ken.
[2523.06 → 2524.90] I am an elder here at Emanuel Church.
[2524.90 → 2529.86] And this morning I have the privilege of leading us in congregational prayer.
[2530.72 → 2535.64] And as I look around at the people sitting around me in church every Sunday,
[2536.18 → 2539.04] I always carry my week with me.
[2539.12 → 2543.66] And I sometimes think everyone has things that have been going on in their lives
[2543.66 → 2544.60] over this past week.
[2545.20 → 2547.48] And some of them we know of and some we don't.
[2547.68 → 2549.86] And as we pray throughout the week,
[2549.92 → 2552.36] I think it's good just to keep in mind the people around us
[2552.36 → 2557.28] and pray for each other continuously and also for us as a body of believers
[2557.28 → 2560.44] that we would continue to turn our hearts and minds to God,
[2560.52 → 2563.70] not just on Sunday mornings, but all through the week.
[2564.42 → 2566.80] Let's turn our heads now to our Lord in prayer.
[2568.88 → 2570.56] Holy God, gracious Father,
[2570.56 → 2573.58] it is so good to be together here as your people,
[2574.12 → 2577.54] singing your praises and turning our hearts to you in worship.
[2578.54 → 2579.06] Alleluia.
[2579.06 → 2581.90] For the Lord God Almighty reigns.
[2582.36 → 2583.46] Worthy is the Lamb.
[2584.80 → 2586.62] And Lord, you tell us to come to you,
[2586.84 → 2588.56] all who are weary and burdened,
[2588.98 → 2590.18] and you will give us rest.
[2590.74 → 2592.94] Lord, sometimes we struggle to find rest.
[2593.08 → 2596.04] We make ourselves overwhelmed and busy with life
[2596.04 → 2598.04] and forget to turn to you for rest, Lord.
[2598.08 → 2599.78] And I pray that you would draw our hearts to you
[2599.78 → 2601.84] and help us find rest.
[2603.16 → 2605.90] We're called to look to the Lord and his strength
[2605.90 → 2607.86] and seek his face always.
[2608.40 → 2609.38] And Lord, we do that now,
[2609.54 → 2611.64] and we pray that you would encourage us
[2611.64 → 2614.00] and guide us to do that throughout the week as well.
[2615.50 → 2617.82] Lord, we have so many things that you've blessed us with,
[2617.86 → 2619.02] so much to be thankful for.
[2619.40 → 2620.36] We thank you for children.
[2620.90 → 2623.40] What a gracious gift it is to see a new little one.
[2623.68 → 2625.78] And we're so thankful and praise you, Lord,
[2625.88 → 2627.22] with Adam and Rachel Said
[2627.22 → 2629.68] for their precious baby boy, Lucas Lars.
[2629.68 → 2632.10] And we thank you, Lord, for the safe arrival,
[2632.30 → 2633.62] and we pray for this young family,
[2633.94 → 2635.10] that they will adjust well,
[2635.42 → 2637.72] and that they will raise him up to know you.
[2639.10 → 2642.48] Lord, we pray for those of us who know of
[2642.48 → 2645.52] and who have children who are not walking with you, Lord,
[2645.60 → 2649.34] and who have wandered from your fold, Lord.
[2649.36 → 2651.16] And we pray that you would draw them to you
[2651.16 → 2654.12] and help us to be encouraged to continue to pray for them
[2654.12 → 2655.84] and continue to minister to each other.
[2655.84 → 2660.06] Lord, we pray for those who are dealing
[2660.06 → 2662.00] with various medical struggles at the time.
[2662.48 → 2664.20] We praise you, Lord, for the good news
[2664.20 → 2666.36] with Everly Astra that all tests so far
[2666.36 → 2667.24] have come back clear.
[2667.80 → 2670.00] But, Lord, we know that there's more still to come,
[2670.14 → 2671.90] and we pray for your healing measure
[2671.90 → 2673.60] and that you would bring her to full,
[2673.94 → 2676.24] continued healing in Everly's little body.
[2678.22 → 2681.08] Father, we pray for all those amongst us
[2681.08 → 2684.02] that we know of with physical and mental health struggles
[2684.02 → 2686.14] and also those we don't know of, Lord.
[2686.44 → 2688.78] And some challenges that people face
[2688.78 → 2690.16] with different health struggles,
[2690.74 → 2693.08] even with daily life, with aches and pains,
[2693.48 → 2695.62] and with the difficulties of aging, Lord,
[2695.66 → 2699.82] it can be life-changing to experience new things
[2699.82 → 2702.62] and new abilities as time goes on, Lord.
[2702.62 → 2706.92] And I pray for people that support those who are struggling
[2706.92 → 2708.54] and for those who are struggling
[2708.54 → 2710.32] with various health issues that we know of.
[2710.32 → 2717.96] And, Father, we also pray for those who are undergoing surgery.
[2718.12 → 2720.04] Soon we think of Emo Smith,
[2720.16 → 2722.38] whose surgery is scheduled for this week,
[2722.42 → 2723.46] for open-heart surgery.
[2724.06 → 2726.46] And, Lord, we pray for your peace
[2726.46 → 2729.30] in Emo and Benita over this week,
[2729.32 → 2731.34] and we pray for successful
[2731.34 → 2734.64] and complete healing through the surgery.
[2734.64 → 2739.08] And, Lord, we pray for those who are struggling
[2739.08 → 2741.64] with different addictions and challenges
[2741.64 → 2743.84] in this life, Lord.
[2743.94 → 2747.46] And we pray for your healing and restoration
[2747.46 → 2748.50] in their lives.
[2749.16 → 2750.64] We think of the world around us,
[2750.70 → 2752.12] and we see many challenges, Lord,
[2752.14 → 2753.38] and we lift those up to you as well.
[2753.70 → 2755.94] We see war, poverty, and hunger.
[2756.50 → 2757.74] Lord, help us to be a light
[2757.74 → 2759.54] to the darkness in this world
[2759.54 → 2761.26] and that you would shine through
[2761.26 → 2763.62] and that we would share the gospel boldly
[2763.62 → 2764.72] with those that we meet.
[2765.98 → 2768.60] Lord, we pray for those in leadership positions
[2768.60 → 2769.34] in this world.
[2769.52 → 2770.88] We pray for our political leaders,
[2771.52 → 2773.06] Lord, that they would know
[2773.06 → 2775.02] that their authority comes from you.
[2775.40 → 2776.48] And even if they don't, Lord,
[2776.54 → 2778.30] that you would guide them to lead
[2778.30 → 2779.62] according to your will.
[2780.68 → 2783.00] And, Lord, we pray for our church leadership as well,
[2783.06 → 2784.94] for our pastors and for our staff
[2784.94 → 2786.60] and for those who volunteer
[2786.60 → 2788.04] in various leadership positions.
[2788.78 → 2790.30] We think of the Reactivate conference
[2790.30 → 2792.24] coming up very soon, Lord,
[2792.30 → 2793.76] and we pray for your guiding hand
[2793.76 → 2795.08] on those who are organizing
[2795.08 → 2796.46] and volunteering for that.
[2796.76 → 2799.82] And we pray for it to be a good time
[2799.82 → 2801.66] of connection and growth
[2801.66 → 2802.54] for the young people
[2802.54 → 2804.36] and for those who volunteer as well.
[2805.64 → 2808.18] And, Lord, as we hear your word now
[2808.18 → 2810.34] and as Pastor Chris brings us your message,
[2810.56 → 2812.20] Lord, we pray that you'd open our hearts,
[2812.20 → 2815.20] stir in us a new desire to learn
[2815.20 → 2816.44] and to know you better
[2816.44 → 2818.14] and to continue to grow in you.
[2818.48 → 2819.78] And we pray that Chris's words
[2819.78 → 2821.52] would be your words to us this morning
[2821.52 → 2823.36] and that our ears would be open to hear
[2823.36 → 2826.16] and our hearts would be guided to change by it.
[2826.30 → 2828.22] We pray these things in Jesus' precious name.
[2828.76 → 2828.96] Amen.
[2842.20 → 2847.42] This summer, part of what we're doing
[2847.42 → 2848.42] in our worship together
[2848.42 → 2851.16] is looking at stories from the book of Acts.
[2851.66 → 2856.10] Today, we're going to read a story from Acts 16.
[2856.92 → 2858.60] And the first time we go through,
[2858.78 → 2861.68] I'm going to read verses 16 through 40.
[2862.14 → 2863.96] The first time we go through, I'll read it.
[2864.00 → 2864.92] It will be on the screen.
[2865.24 → 2865.90] We'll go ahead.
[2866.32 → 2867.24] But I encourage you,
[2867.40 → 2868.76] if you have a Bible with you,
[2868.82 → 2870.32] to open that up and to have that
[2870.32 → 2872.14] and keep that open as we go through.
[2872.66 → 2873.88] If you didn't bring a Bible,
[2874.14 → 2875.44] you can turn on your phone
[2875.44 → 2877.42] or the device that you have,
[2877.54 → 2880.00] your Bible apps on and follow along there.
[2880.00 → 2881.48] Or there's a few at the back
[2881.48 → 2882.92] that are available as well.
[2883.04 → 2884.82] I encourage you to grab one of those.
[2885.54 → 2888.42] Additionally, because it's summer,
[2888.70 → 2890.26] we're doing our children's worship time
[2890.26 → 2891.50] a little bit differently.
[2892.06 → 2893.10] And so we have clipboards
[2893.10 → 2895.98] with some crosswords and pictures
[2895.98 → 2897.70] and things for the kids
[2897.70 → 2899.86] or for anyone who is aided
[2899.86 → 2902.06] by having something to draw or colour
[2902.06 → 2902.80] while they listen.
[2903.66 → 2906.12] And we're collecting pictures every week
[2906.12 → 2908.46] from the sermon or from the story.
[2908.66 → 2911.08] And so if you hear something that I say
[2911.08 → 2912.46] and it moves you to draw a picture,
[2912.74 → 2914.06] we want you to do that.
[2914.12 → 2916.40] And then we want you to give it back to us
[2916.40 → 2918.58] because we're going to create an art display
[2918.58 → 2919.54] at the end of summer
[2919.54 → 2921.74] of all the pictures from the sermons and the like.
[2921.84 → 2923.34] And so grab a clipboard.
[2923.52 → 2924.24] If they're all gone,
[2924.36 → 2925.50] if they're not, I can see them.
[2925.50 → 2927.34] You can use the back of the bulletin
[2927.34 → 2928.42] that you were given as well
[2928.42 → 2929.54] to draw a picture on
[2929.54 → 2932.56] so that we can share that later.
[2933.06 → 2935.78] I'm going to read from Acts 16.
[2936.66 → 2938.74] And Tara, I'm going to start at verse 16.
[2938.84 → 2939.24] Excellent.
[2941.36 → 2943.14] Acts 16, starting at verse 16.
[2945.54 → 2948.38] Once, when we were going to the place of prayer,
[2948.90 → 2950.82] we were met by a female slave
[2950.82 → 2953.70] who had a spirit by which she predicted the future.
[2953.70 → 2956.56] She earned a great deal of money
[2956.56 → 2958.32] for her owners by fortune-telling.
[2959.46 → 2961.48] She followed Paul and the rest of us,
[2961.68 → 2961.98] shouting,
[2962.50 → 2964.64] These men are servants of the Most High God
[2964.64 → 2966.60] who are telling you the way to be saved.
[2967.70 → 2969.56] And she kept this up for many days.
[2970.24 → 2972.08] Finally, Paul became so annoyed
[2972.08 → 2974.30] that he turned around and said to the spirit,
[2974.64 → 2976.10] In the name of Jesus Christ,
[2976.22 → 2978.42] I command you to come out of her.
[2979.16 → 2980.90] And at that moment, the spirit left her.
[2980.90 → 2984.28] When her owners realized
[2984.28 → 2986.66] that their hope of making money was gone,
[2986.80 → 2988.64] they seized Paul and Silas
[2988.64 → 2990.84] and dragged them into the marketplace
[2990.84 → 2992.56] to face the authorities.
[2993.72 → 2995.88] They brought them before the magistrates
[2995.88 → 2996.28] and said,
[2996.76 → 2998.20] These men are Jews
[2998.20 → 3000.60] and are throwing our city into an uproar
[3000.60 → 3003.50] by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans
[3003.50 → 3005.48] to accept or to practice.
[3005.48 → 3009.32] The crowd joined in the attack
[3009.32 → 3010.90] against Paul and Silas.
[3011.68 → 3013.22] And the magistrates ordered them
[3013.22 → 3015.04] to be stripped and beaten with rods.
[3016.18 → 3017.98] After they had been severely flogged,
[3018.04 → 3019.10] they were thrown into prison
[3019.10 → 3020.80] and the jailer was commanded
[3020.80 → 3022.10] to guard them carefully.
[3022.82 → 3024.22] And when he received these orders,
[3024.54 → 3026.26] he put them in the inner cell
[3026.26 → 3028.68] and fastened their feet in the stocks.
[3029.98 → 3031.06] About midnight,
[3031.26 → 3032.66] Paul and Silas were praying
[3032.66 → 3034.06] and singing hymns to God
[3034.06 → 3035.22] and the other prisoners
[3035.22 → 3036.20] were listening to them.
[3036.60 → 3039.04] Suddenly, there was such a violent earthquake
[3039.04 → 3041.28] that the foundations of the prison were shaken.
[3042.52 → 3044.46] At once, all the doors flew open
[3044.46 → 3046.48] and everyone's chains came loose.
[3046.98 → 3048.00] The jailer woke up
[3048.00 → 3049.68] and when he saw the prison doors open,
[3049.76 → 3050.64] he drew his sword
[3050.64 → 3051.90] and was about to kill himself
[3051.90 → 3053.66] because he thought the prisoners had escaped.
[3054.16 → 3055.04] But Paul shouted,
[3055.66 → 3057.36] Do not harm yourself.
[3058.08 → 3058.90] We are all here.
[3058.90 → 3062.28] The jailer called for lights,
[3062.50 → 3063.08] rushed in,
[3063.22 → 3064.06] and fell trembling
[3064.06 → 3065.64] before Paul and Silas.
[3066.42 → 3067.46] He brought them out
[3067.46 → 3067.92] and asked,
[3068.10 → 3070.18] Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
[3071.34 → 3072.06] They replied,
[3072.18 → 3073.56] Believe in the Lord Jesus
[3073.56 → 3075.04] and you will be saved,
[3075.38 → 3076.82] you and your household.
[3078.22 → 3080.34] Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him
[3080.34 → 3082.20] and to all the others in his house.
[3083.22 → 3084.76] At that hour of the night,
[3084.84 → 3085.78] the jailer took them
[3085.78 → 3086.98] and washed their wounds
[3086.98 → 3088.14] and then immediately
[3088.14 → 3090.28] he and all his household were baptized.
[3091.40 → 3093.24] The jailer brought them into his house
[3093.24 → 3094.64] and set a meal before them.
[3094.96 → 3096.60] He was filled with such joy
[3096.60 → 3098.62] because he had come to believe in God,
[3098.96 → 3100.68] he and his whole household.
[3102.58 → 3103.78] When it was daylight,
[3103.92 → 3105.76] the magistrates sent their officers
[3105.76 → 3108.26] to the jailer with the order,
[3108.72 → 3109.58] Release those men.
[3110.24 → 3111.38] The jailer told Paul,
[3111.80 → 3112.90] The magistrates have ordered
[3112.90 → 3114.44] that you and Silas be released.
[3114.80 → 3115.62] Now you can go.
[3115.62 → 3116.92] Now you can leave.
[3117.08 → 3117.74] Go in peace.
[3119.08 → 3120.46] But Paul said to the officers,
[3121.38 → 3123.34] They beat us publicly without a trial,
[3123.48 → 3125.38] even though we are Roman citizens,
[3125.66 → 3127.08] and threw us into prison.
[3127.34 → 3129.12] And now they want to get rid of us quietly?
[3129.62 → 3131.40] No, let them come themselves
[3131.40 → 3132.76] and escort us out.
[3134.16 → 3136.60] The officers reported this to the magistrates,
[3136.82 → 3138.78] and when they heard that Paul and Silas
[3138.78 → 3139.80] were Roman citizens,
[3140.08 → 3140.86] they were alarmed.
[3141.70 → 3143.22] They came to appease them
[3143.22 → 3144.88] and escorted them from the prison,
[3145.28 → 3147.10] requesting them to leave the city.
[3147.98 → 3150.18] After Paul and Silas came out of the prison,
[3150.56 → 3151.76] they went to Lydia's house,
[3152.18 → 3153.90] where they met with the brothers and sisters
[3153.90 → 3155.38] and encouraged them.
[3155.92 → 3157.30] Then they left.
[3157.30 → 3159.16] This is the word of the Lord.
[3163.16 → 3167.46] Now this is another one of those fascinating stories
[3167.46 → 3169.34] from the early church
[3169.34 → 3172.52] that we are using to help frame
[3172.52 → 3177.32] our contemporary experience of life and faith.
[3177.84 → 3180.12] Although for most of us here,
[3180.52 → 3183.28] the parallels aren't exactly one-to-one.
[3183.28 → 3184.52] That is to say,
[3184.58 → 3186.70] I haven't heard any of your stories yet
[3186.70 → 3188.18] of being arrested
[3188.18 → 3190.62] for casting out spirits
[3190.62 → 3192.02] in a marketplace
[3192.02 → 3194.22] and then having to deal with the magistrates.
[3195.94 → 3197.94] And yet, I do think
[3197.94 → 3200.38] that there are parallels and lots
[3200.38 → 3201.98] that we can learn from
[3201.98 → 3203.14] in this text
[3203.14 → 3205.00] and from this story.
[3206.10 → 3206.82] Particularly,
[3207.18 → 3208.72] what I hope that we will see
[3208.72 → 3213.24] is how we might find strength in God
[3213.24 → 3215.56] during these kinds of trials
[3215.56 → 3217.46] or during persecutions.
[3217.52 → 3219.38] That's the sort of banner for us this morning.
[3219.52 → 3221.28] Finding strength in God
[3221.28 → 3223.36] during trials and persecution.
[3223.56 → 3225.96] How can we do that
[3225.96 → 3228.96] based on what we have seen
[3228.96 → 3231.02] in this story and text?
[3232.04 → 3232.68] Now let me give you
[3232.68 → 3233.72] just a little bit of context.
[3233.72 → 3234.20] context.
[3234.62 → 3236.72] And as I tell the story
[3236.72 → 3237.60] a little bit of how
[3237.60 → 3239.30] we get to chapter 16,
[3239.92 → 3240.76] there is a map
[3240.76 → 3241.42] that will appear
[3241.42 → 3242.98] on the screen behind me
[3242.98 → 3244.58] and you can kind of follow along.
[3244.70 → 3246.18] The circles indicate
[3246.18 → 3246.82] those places
[3246.82 → 3248.76] that we're going to be talking about
[3248.76 → 3249.96] as I bring them.
[3250.08 → 3251.42] But Paul and Silas
[3251.42 → 3253.00] are travelling together
[3253.00 → 3254.22] on what is now
[3254.22 → 3256.16] Paul's second missionary journey.
[3256.80 → 3257.70] And so he had gone
[3257.70 → 3259.52] through this region once
[3259.52 → 3261.16] and then come back to Jerusalem
[3261.16 → 3262.74] for the Jerusalem Council
[3262.74 → 3264.22] where the leaders of the church
[3264.22 → 3264.78] got together
[3264.78 → 3266.08] and made some decisions
[3266.08 → 3267.38] that impacted the mission
[3267.38 → 3268.10] of the church
[3268.10 → 3269.74] to the Gentile world.
[3270.08 → 3271.18] And now Paul and Silas
[3271.18 → 3272.54] are going out again.
[3273.32 → 3274.26] And from Jerusalem
[3274.26 → 3275.94] they travel north.
[3276.84 → 3278.06] Now in Lustra
[3278.06 → 3279.70] they collect Timothy
[3279.70 → 3281.94] who will be Paul's companion
[3281.94 → 3284.92] and who Paul will disciple
[3284.92 → 3285.76] and mentor
[3285.76 → 3287.76] for the rest of his life.
[3288.80 → 3289.80] Now the first time
[3289.80 → 3291.18] that Paul came to Lustra
[3291.18 → 3292.84] on his first missionary journey
[3292.84 → 3294.10] you can read a story
[3294.10 → 3295.74] where he heals a man
[3295.74 → 3297.06] who was lame from birth.
[3297.50 → 3298.98] That means he could never walk.
[3299.84 → 3301.00] And while he was there
[3301.00 → 3302.36] and after healing the man
[3302.36 → 3303.66] the people of Lustra
[3303.66 → 3305.72] began to call Paul
[3305.72 → 3307.46] and his companion then
[3307.46 → 3308.24] Barnabas,
[3308.72 → 3309.30] Hermes,
[3309.56 → 3310.12] and Zeus.
[3311.28 → 3312.06] And so Zeus
[3312.06 → 3314.32] is the chief god
[3314.32 → 3315.54] of the Greek pantheon
[3315.54 → 3316.36] and Hermes
[3316.36 → 3317.32] is his messenger.
[3318.02 → 3318.70] And the book of Acts
[3318.70 → 3319.66] tells us that they called
[3319.66 → 3320.50] Paul Hermes
[3320.50 → 3321.62] because he did the speaking.
[3323.32 → 3324.04] And so the people
[3324.04 → 3325.52] seeing what they had done
[3325.52 → 3327.74] wanted to offer sacrifices
[3327.74 → 3328.90] to Paul
[3328.90 → 3329.80] and to Barnabas
[3329.80 → 3331.88] as representatives
[3331.88 → 3333.12] or incarnations
[3333.12 → 3333.74] if you will
[3333.74 → 3334.86] of Hermes
[3334.86 → 3335.68] and Zeus.
[3335.86 → 3336.22] But of course
[3336.22 → 3336.88] Paul and Barnabas
[3336.88 → 3337.20] are saying
[3337.20 → 3338.66] no, don't do that,
[3338.74 → 3339.54] don't do that.
[3339.88 → 3340.62] But then
[3340.62 → 3342.40] what often happens
[3342.40 → 3343.16] when Paul is on
[3343.16 → 3344.10] his missionary journeys
[3344.10 → 3345.60] a group of others
[3345.60 → 3346.88] follow after him
[3346.88 → 3347.60] and particularly
[3347.60 → 3348.62] Jewish leaders
[3348.62 → 3349.80] follow after them
[3349.80 → 3350.42] and cause trouble
[3350.42 → 3351.04] for them.
[3352.38 → 3353.20] And so this Jewish
[3353.20 → 3354.46] group of leaders
[3354.46 → 3355.00] come in
[3355.00 → 3356.06] and they stir up
[3356.06 → 3356.70] the crowds
[3356.70 → 3357.52] against Paul
[3357.52 → 3358.26] and Barnabas.
[3358.54 → 3359.18] You can read this
[3359.18 → 3360.06] in Acts 14
[3360.06 → 3362.68] stirring them up
[3362.68 → 3364.02] because they're saying
[3364.02 → 3364.92] don't worship us
[3364.92 → 3365.40] and they wanted
[3365.40 → 3366.18] to worship them
[3366.18 → 3367.24] and so
[3367.24 → 3368.46] because they are stirred
[3368.46 → 3369.22] you can read
[3369.22 → 3371.10] that they stoned him
[3371.10 → 3371.86] that's Paul
[3371.86 → 3372.58] and dragged him
[3372.58 → 3373.56] outside the city
[3373.56 → 3374.52] thinking he was dead.
[3374.52 → 3376.60] But then
[3376.60 → 3377.92] after the disciples
[3377.92 → 3378.92] gathered around him
[3378.92 → 3379.48] and I'm assuming
[3379.48 → 3380.24] that's to pray
[3380.24 → 3381.50] he got up
[3381.50 → 3382.48] and he went back
[3382.48 → 3383.08] into the city.
[3384.18 → 3385.16] That's pretty cool
[3385.16 → 3385.72] as you read
[3385.72 → 3386.32] these stories.
[3386.80 → 3387.42] He's stoned
[3387.42 → 3388.22] they think he's dead
[3388.22 → 3389.26] they pray over him
[3389.26 → 3389.80] he gets up
[3389.80 → 3390.66] and what does he do?
[3390.74 → 3391.78] He goes right back in
[3391.78 → 3393.08] to the lion's dead.
[3394.34 → 3395.02] The point there
[3395.02 → 3396.18] and why I'm belabouring
[3396.18 → 3396.78] this point here
[3396.78 → 3397.54] is that Paul
[3397.54 → 3398.40] and his companions
[3398.40 → 3399.36] are familiar
[3399.36 → 3400.36] with suffering
[3400.36 → 3401.04] for the gospel.
[3401.04 → 3403.30] Right?
[3403.38 → 3403.88] And so now
[3403.88 → 3405.16] in this journey
[3405.16 → 3406.08] where we're picking up
[3406.08 → 3406.68] our chapter
[3406.68 → 3408.16] on the second missionary
[3408.16 → 3409.26] journey from Lustra
[3409.26 → 3410.02] after they gather
[3410.02 → 3410.54] Timothy
[3410.54 → 3412.36] they go to tRNAs
[3412.36 → 3413.98] where it seems
[3413.98 → 3415.08] that Luke joins them.
[3415.70 → 3416.46] Luke is the author
[3416.46 → 3418.22] of the book of Acts
[3418.22 → 3418.60] here
[3418.60 → 3420.10] and from there
[3420.10 → 3420.92] they travel
[3420.92 → 3422.32] around the northern
[3422.32 → 3423.86] coast of the Aegean Sea
[3423.86 → 3424.78] and they come
[3424.78 → 3425.60] to Philippi
[3425.60 → 3426.86] which we can read
[3426.86 → 3428.48] is a leading city
[3428.48 → 3429.96] in the Roman Empire
[3429.96 → 3431.20] and that's where
[3431.20 → 3432.06] he meets Lydia
[3432.06 → 3433.68] and stays with her
[3433.68 → 3434.28] for a while
[3434.28 → 3436.18] and it's well
[3436.18 → 3437.06] in Philippi
[3437.06 → 3438.30] that our story
[3438.30 → 3439.00] takes place.
[3439.72 → 3440.14] Now the story
[3440.14 → 3440.64] that we read
[3440.64 → 3442.24] starts by saying
[3442.24 → 3444.08] when we were going
[3444.08 → 3444.76] to the place
[3444.76 → 3445.32] of prayer.
[3446.40 → 3447.18] Now in Philippi
[3447.18 → 3449.10] Paul and the others
[3449.10 → 3450.42] would go outside
[3450.42 → 3451.52] the city gates
[3451.52 → 3452.72] to a place
[3452.72 → 3453.52] by a river
[3453.52 → 3454.80] where they would
[3454.80 → 3455.80] gather to pray.
[3456.70 → 3457.88] Now this little detail
[3457.88 → 3459.06] actually is really
[3459.06 → 3459.94] informative for us
[3459.94 → 3460.72] because it tells us
[3460.72 → 3461.30] something about
[3461.30 → 3462.78] the city of Philippi
[3462.78 → 3463.64] and its makeup
[3463.64 → 3465.32] because Paul's
[3465.32 → 3466.22] ordinary practice
[3466.22 → 3467.06] when he gets into
[3467.06 → 3467.44] a city
[3467.44 → 3468.56] is to go to the synagogue.
[3469.46 → 3470.08] Now the synagogue
[3470.08 → 3471.56] is the place
[3471.56 → 3472.28] where the Jewish
[3472.28 → 3473.46] population
[3473.46 → 3474.40] primarily the men
[3474.40 → 3475.06] would gather
[3475.06 → 3476.56] for worship
[3476.56 → 3477.60] for reading of the law
[3477.60 → 3478.30] it's where Torah
[3478.30 → 3479.18] school would happen
[3479.18 → 3481.10] but in Philippi
[3481.10 → 3482.04] there's likely
[3482.04 → 3482.96] no synagogue
[3482.96 → 3484.22] because the Jewish
[3484.22 → 3484.78] population
[3484.78 → 3485.72] is too small.
[3486.72 → 3486.78] Right?
[3486.78 → 3487.26] The synagogue
[3487.26 → 3488.80] required ten Jewish
[3488.80 → 3489.90] men to live
[3489.90 → 3490.40] in the city
[3490.40 → 3491.48] for them to found it
[3491.48 → 3492.92] but because Paul
[3492.92 → 3494.02] doesn't go to the synagogue
[3494.02 → 3494.84] instead they go
[3494.84 → 3495.42] to a place
[3495.42 → 3496.54] outside the city
[3496.54 → 3497.12] to pray
[3497.12 → 3498.82] can likely conclude
[3498.82 → 3499.74] that there's such
[3499.74 → 3500.46] a small Jewish
[3500.46 → 3501.46] population there
[3501.46 → 3502.20] that they don't
[3502.20 → 3502.74] have a synagogue
[3502.74 → 3504.16] and so they go
[3504.16 → 3505.10] to this place
[3505.10 → 3507.08] where the small
[3507.08 → 3508.24] gathering of people
[3508.24 → 3509.28] happens outside
[3509.28 → 3509.92] the city
[3509.92 → 3510.90] by the river
[3510.90 → 3512.66] and they would do
[3512.66 → 3513.50] that as was
[3513.50 → 3514.12] their practice
[3514.12 → 3514.86] on the Sabbath
[3514.86 → 3516.30] every week.
[3517.12 → 3518.18] Now our story
[3518.18 → 3519.72] is one of those journeys
[3519.72 → 3521.06] because Paul is here
[3521.06 → 3521.74] for a while
[3521.74 → 3522.22] right?
[3522.28 → 3523.10] And on the way
[3523.10 → 3523.98] to this place
[3523.98 → 3524.94] the journey that they made
[3524.94 → 3525.86] probably weekly
[3525.86 → 3527.80] a female slave
[3527.80 → 3529.38] with a spirit
[3529.38 → 3530.92] shouts them down
[3530.92 → 3531.96] right?
[3532.00 → 3532.60] And this would happen
[3532.60 → 3533.48] week after week
[3533.48 → 3534.26] as they journeyed.
[3534.42 → 3535.24] Now it's kind of cool
[3535.24 → 3535.86] or at least
[3535.86 → 3536.64] I think it's cool
[3536.64 → 3537.84] in Greek
[3537.84 → 3539.26] it says
[3539.26 → 3541.00] this female slave
[3541.00 → 3542.92] has a python spirit.
[3544.22 → 3545.22] A python spirit.
[3545.28 → 3546.24] Now that's the name
[3546.24 → 3547.38] of the serpent
[3547.38 → 3548.78] that guards
[3548.78 → 3549.62] the oracle
[3549.62 → 3550.54] at Delphi.
[3550.94 → 3551.44] If you know anything
[3551.44 → 3552.46] about Greek mythology
[3552.46 → 3554.30] the oracle at Delphi
[3554.30 → 3555.42] is one of those
[3555.42 → 3556.54] places on
[3556.54 → 3557.50] Mount Parnassus
[3557.50 → 3559.02] where leaders
[3559.02 → 3560.14] and generals
[3560.14 → 3561.54] and people of influence
[3561.54 → 3562.16] would come
[3562.16 → 3563.04] and they would ask
[3563.04 → 3564.04] for a prophecy
[3564.04 → 3565.62] or an affirmation
[3565.62 → 3567.10] from this oracle
[3567.10 → 3568.22] to bless
[3568.22 → 3569.58] their efforts
[3569.58 → 3570.40] or to discern
[3570.40 → 3571.12] the fates.
[3572.02 → 3572.90] And the story
[3572.90 → 3573.84] in Greek mythology
[3573.84 → 3575.88] is that at the foot
[3575.88 → 3577.22] of Mount Parnassus
[3577.22 → 3578.10] there was this
[3578.10 → 3579.12] large python
[3579.12 → 3580.34] this large serpent
[3580.34 → 3581.38] and Apollo
[3581.38 → 3582.82] comes and kills it.
[3583.96 → 3584.50] Now Apollo
[3584.50 → 3586.04] in the Greek pantheon
[3586.04 → 3587.16] is known as
[3587.16 → 3589.08] the one of the gods
[3589.08 → 3589.64] of truth
[3589.64 → 3590.50] and prophecy.
[3591.54 → 3591.96] And so
[3591.96 → 3593.32] when he establishes
[3593.32 → 3594.96] the python spirit
[3594.96 → 3595.92] in the oracle
[3595.92 → 3596.76] at Delphi
[3596.76 → 3598.04] it's a gift
[3598.04 → 3598.76] of Apollo
[3598.76 → 3599.86] in order to predict
[3599.86 → 3600.58] the future
[3600.58 → 3602.16] and to help
[3602.16 → 3602.70] the people
[3602.70 → 3604.20] reveal the fates
[3604.20 → 3605.42] by unveiling
[3605.42 → 3606.78] hidden truths.
[3608.02 → 3608.68] And so
[3608.68 → 3609.66] this woman
[3609.66 → 3611.30] has a python
[3611.30 → 3612.52] spirit
[3612.52 → 3614.48] and all of this
[3614.48 → 3615.56] mythology
[3615.56 → 3616.88] is behind
[3616.88 → 3618.14] the exchange.
[3619.72 → 3620.46] So picture it,
[3620.52 → 3620.68] right?
[3621.68 → 3623.12] When she goes along
[3623.12 → 3623.80] with Paul
[3623.80 → 3624.64] and the group
[3624.64 → 3625.76] she's shouting
[3625.76 → 3627.50] these men
[3627.50 → 3628.08] are servants
[3628.08 → 3628.70] of the most
[3628.70 → 3629.38] high God
[3629.38 → 3630.40] who are telling
[3630.40 → 3630.90] you the way
[3630.90 → 3631.62] to be saved.
[3633.50 → 3634.74] And she's not wrong.
[3636.54 → 3637.02] Right?
[3637.08 → 3637.84] She's revealing
[3637.84 → 3638.96] these hidden truths.
[3640.62 → 3641.32] And whether
[3641.32 → 3642.16] it's her tone
[3642.16 → 3642.76] maybe it was
[3642.76 → 3643.38] dismissive
[3643.38 → 3644.40] or condescending
[3644.40 → 3645.72] or whether it's
[3645.72 → 3646.22] just because
[3646.22 → 3646.96] it was constant
[3646.96 → 3647.54] irritation.
[3648.06 → 3648.20] Right?
[3648.20 → 3648.74] We read that
[3648.74 → 3649.62] she kept this up
[3649.62 → 3650.52] for many days.
[3650.52 → 3651.84] Paul eventually
[3651.84 → 3652.70] has enough.
[3653.60 → 3654.52] And he turns
[3654.52 → 3655.10] and he says
[3655.10 → 3655.74] to the spirit
[3655.74 → 3657.02] and notice
[3657.02 → 3657.52] right?
[3657.64 → 3658.44] Paul addresses
[3658.44 → 3659.12] the spirit
[3659.12 → 3660.86] not the slave girl.
[3661.44 → 3662.50] He says to the spirit
[3662.50 → 3664.34] in the name
[3664.34 → 3665.58] of Jesus Christ
[3665.58 → 3667.26] I command you
[3667.26 → 3668.04] to come out
[3668.04 → 3668.38] of her.
[3670.16 → 3670.92] The thing I want us
[3670.92 → 3671.76] to see first
[3671.76 → 3672.94] here is the
[3672.94 → 3674.68] spiritual reality
[3674.68 → 3675.98] behind this
[3675.98 → 3676.66] exchange.
[3678.26 → 3678.98] These are more
[3678.98 → 3680.06] than just words
[3680.06 → 3681.08] or ideas
[3681.08 → 3682.06] being thrown around.
[3682.98 → 3683.08] Right?
[3683.14 → 3683.68] For Paul
[3683.68 → 3685.06] proclaiming the gospel
[3685.06 → 3686.76] is a spiritual
[3686.76 → 3687.32] battle
[3687.32 → 3688.42] between the gods
[3688.42 → 3689.26] of the age
[3689.26 → 3690.74] and the most
[3690.74 → 3691.82] high God.
[3693.80 → 3694.74] I want to read
[3694.74 → 3695.36] something for you
[3695.36 → 3697.56] from Ephesians 6.
[3698.70 → 3699.56] I'm going to read
[3699.56 → 3700.14] ten verses
[3700.14 → 3702.26] from Ephesians 6
[3702.26 → 3702.86] to help us
[3702.86 → 3704.06] make this point
[3704.06 → 3704.36] again.
[3705.42 → 3706.50] This is a letter
[3706.50 → 3707.74] that Paul writes
[3707.74 → 3708.34] to the church
[3708.34 → 3709.00] in Ephesus.
[3710.24 → 3711.02] He says
[3711.02 → 3712.54] finally
[3712.54 → 3713.78] be strong
[3713.78 → 3714.36] in the Lord
[3714.36 → 3715.14] and in his
[3715.14 → 3715.92] mighty power.
[3716.34 → 3717.06] Put on the full
[3717.06 → 3717.86] armour of God
[3717.86 → 3718.52] so that you
[3718.52 → 3719.30] can take your
[3719.30 → 3720.12] stand against
[3720.12 → 3721.54] the devil's schemes
[3721.54 → 3722.42] for our struggle
[3722.42 → 3723.22] is not against
[3723.22 → 3724.40] flesh and blood
[3724.40 → 3725.32] but against the rulers
[3725.32 → 3726.38] and against the authorities
[3726.38 → 3727.38] and against the powers
[3727.38 → 3728.28] of this dark world
[3728.28 → 3728.88] and against the
[3728.88 → 3729.88] spiritual forces
[3729.88 → 3730.84] of evil
[3730.84 → 3731.84] in the heavenly realms.
[3732.60 → 3732.92] Therefore
[3732.92 → 3734.32] put on the full
[3734.32 → 3735.14] armour of God
[3735.14 → 3735.96] so that
[3735.96 → 3736.78] when the day
[3736.78 → 3737.70] of evil comes
[3737.70 → 3738.54] you may be able
[3738.54 → 3739.88] to stand your ground
[3739.88 → 3740.92] and after you
[3740.92 → 3742.02] have done everything
[3742.02 → 3743.04] to stand.
[3744.04 → 3744.86] Stand firm
[3744.86 → 3745.86] then with the belt
[3745.86 → 3746.40] of truth
[3746.40 → 3747.80] buckled around your waist
[3747.80 → 3748.64] with the breastplate
[3748.64 → 3749.24] of righteousness
[3749.24 → 3749.92] in place
[3749.92 → 3750.96] and with your feet
[3750.96 → 3752.10] fitted with readiness
[3752.10 → 3752.88] that comes
[3752.88 → 3753.86] from the gospel
[3753.86 → 3754.42] of peace
[3754.42 → 3756.46] and in addition
[3756.46 → 3757.56] to all this
[3757.56 → 3758.96] take up the shield
[3758.96 → 3759.58] of faith
[3759.58 → 3760.72] with which
[3760.72 → 3761.98] you can extinguish
[3761.98 → 3763.32] all the flaming arrows
[3763.32 → 3764.24] of the evil one
[3764.24 → 3765.72] take the helmet
[3765.72 → 3766.44] of salvation
[3766.44 → 3767.28] and the sword
[3767.28 → 3767.98] of the spirit
[3767.98 → 3769.02] which is the word
[3769.02 → 3769.64] of God
[3769.64 → 3771.16] and pray
[3771.16 → 3772.16] in the spirit
[3772.16 → 3773.40] on all occasions
[3773.40 → 3774.46] with all kinds
[3774.46 → 3775.26] of prayers
[3775.26 → 3776.02] and requests
[3776.02 → 3778.10] and with this in mind
[3778.10 → 3778.80] be alert
[3778.80 → 3780.00] and always keep
[3780.00 → 3780.66] on praying
[3780.66 → 3781.82] for the Lord's people
[3781.82 → 3784.22] pray also for me
[3784.22 → 3786.02] that whenever I speak
[3786.02 → 3786.94] words may be given
[3786.94 → 3787.30] to me
[3787.30 → 3787.82] so that I will
[3787.82 → 3789.10] fearlessly make known
[3789.10 → 3789.92] the mystery
[3789.92 → 3790.52] of the gospel
[3790.52 → 3791.60] for which I am
[3791.60 → 3792.18] an ambassador
[3792.18 → 3793.50] in chains
[3793.50 → 3796.18] pray that I may
[3796.18 → 3797.48] declare it fearlessly
[3797.48 → 3799.12] as I should
[3799.12 → 3801.46] did you catch
[3801.46 → 3802.40] what Paul says
[3802.40 → 3804.88] he says that our struggle
[3804.88 → 3805.84] isn't against flesh
[3805.84 → 3806.32] and blood
[3806.32 → 3807.26] but against powers
[3807.26 → 3808.44] of this dark world
[3808.44 → 3809.30] and against the spiritual
[3809.30 → 3810.32] forces of evil
[3810.32 → 3811.54] in the heavenly realms
[3811.54 → 3813.02] and he says that the way
[3813.02 → 3814.38] that we fight this battle
[3814.38 → 3815.32] is to pray
[3815.32 → 3816.06] in the spirit
[3816.06 → 3817.38] on all occasions
[3817.38 → 3818.82] armed with the word
[3818.82 → 3819.36] of God
[3819.36 → 3820.44] and with the song
[3820.44 → 3821.48] more on that
[3821.48 → 3821.84] in a moment
[3821.84 → 3822.60] we'll come back to that
[3822.60 → 3824.20] but Paul says
[3824.20 → 3825.62] specifically in there
[3825.62 → 3827.36] right in Ephesians text
[3827.36 → 3828.44] to pray for him
[3828.44 → 3830.34] so that whenever he speaks
[3830.34 → 3832.12] words may be given to him
[3832.12 → 3833.56] that he might fearlessly
[3833.56 → 3834.62] make known
[3834.62 → 3836.48] the mystery of the gospel
[3836.48 → 3837.96] so that he could declare it
[3837.96 → 3838.70] fearlessly
[3838.70 → 3839.88] as he should
[3839.88 → 3842.74] in a letter that Paul
[3842.74 → 3843.58] writes to Timothy
[3843.58 → 3844.78] he says
[3844.78 → 3845.60] and he warns
[3845.60 → 3847.92] some will abandon the faith
[3847.92 → 3849.78] and follow deceiving spirits
[3849.78 → 3850.42] and things
[3850.42 → 3852.76] taught by demons
[3852.76 → 3856.00] in case
[3856.00 → 3857.98] I'm not being clear
[3857.98 → 3859.10] enough yet
[3859.10 → 3861.08] the gospel
[3861.08 → 3862.76] is a message
[3862.76 → 3864.88] of spiritual impact
[3864.88 → 3866.86] and spiritual reality
[3866.86 → 3868.84] and the battle
[3868.84 → 3870.46] that Christians face
[3870.46 → 3872.22] are first and foremost
[3872.22 → 3874.40] spiritual battles
[3874.40 → 3876.60] right when you talk
[3876.60 → 3877.24] with your friends
[3877.24 → 3877.88] at school
[3877.88 → 3879.08] when you talk
[3879.08 → 3879.84] with your colleagues
[3879.84 → 3880.72] at work
[3880.72 → 3881.42] about Jesus
[3881.42 → 3882.72] and about the gospel
[3882.72 → 3883.90] you are engaging
[3883.90 → 3884.72] in more than just
[3884.72 → 3885.92] an exchange of words
[3885.92 → 3887.50] you are engaging
[3887.50 → 3888.38] in a war
[3888.38 → 3889.24] against the spirit
[3889.24 → 3890.00] of this age
[3890.00 → 3892.60] maybe
[3892.60 → 3894.78] maybe some of us
[3894.78 → 3896.48] are guilty
[3896.48 → 3897.34] of approaching
[3897.34 → 3898.46] these conversations
[3898.46 → 3900.18] too casually
[3900.18 → 3902.24] maybe some of us
[3902.24 → 3902.68] are guilty
[3902.68 → 3903.96] of approaching worship
[3903.96 → 3904.90] of this moment
[3904.90 → 3905.98] of sitting under
[3905.98 → 3906.40] the preaching
[3906.40 → 3906.90] of the word
[3906.90 → 3908.04] too casually
[3908.04 → 3909.74] because this is
[3909.74 → 3910.98] a spiritual war
[3910.98 → 3912.46] and a spiritual reality
[3912.46 → 3913.20] and you are being
[3913.20 → 3915.06] equipped for this battle
[3915.06 → 3917.38] and like a mother
[3917.38 → 3919.46] who pleads with God
[3919.46 → 3920.12] daily
[3920.12 → 3921.72] for her wandering children
[3921.72 → 3923.06] we need to be
[3923.06 → 3923.70] in prayer
[3923.70 → 3924.92] for these kinds
[3924.92 → 3925.70] of conversations
[3925.70 → 3926.88] for these people
[3926.88 → 3927.58] in our lives
[3927.58 → 3929.16] we need to be
[3929.16 → 3929.82] taking up
[3929.82 → 3931.04] the word of God
[3931.04 → 3932.28] the sword of truth
[3932.28 → 3933.78] for these conversations
[3933.78 → 3936.76] I was reading
[3936.76 → 3938.00] an article
[3938.00 → 3939.80] this week
[3939.80 → 3941.58] that made
[3941.58 → 3942.76] a really compelling
[3942.76 → 3943.32] argument
[3943.32 → 3945.60] for the best way
[3945.60 → 3946.76] to share
[3946.76 → 3947.86] the word of God
[3947.86 → 3948.62] with people
[3948.62 → 3950.96] being to start
[3950.96 → 3952.52] by memorizing
[3952.52 → 3953.64] the word of God
[3953.64 → 3956.38] and so I guess
[3956.38 → 3957.32] the simple question
[3957.32 → 3958.06] for you
[3958.06 → 3959.72] if you've ever
[3959.72 → 3960.60] thought to yourself
[3960.60 → 3962.88] oh I don't want
[3962.88 → 3963.98] to have that conversation
[3963.98 → 3965.40] because I don't know
[3965.40 → 3966.32] what I'll have to say
[3966.32 → 3967.62] or I don't want
[3967.62 → 3968.26] to talk about Jesus
[3968.26 → 3968.84] with that person
[3968.84 → 3969.30] because what if
[3969.30 → 3970.00] they ask me something
[3970.00 → 3970.50] I don't know
[3970.50 → 3971.56] the answer to
[3971.56 → 3973.66] maybe one of the
[3973.66 → 3974.16] disciplines
[3974.16 → 3976.06] we need to start
[3976.06 → 3976.78] taking up
[3976.78 → 3978.58] is scripture memorization
[3978.58 → 3980.38] that we might
[3980.38 → 3981.42] have the word
[3981.42 → 3981.84] of God
[3981.84 → 3982.70] in us
[3982.70 → 3983.64] so that we can
[3983.64 → 3984.94] speak the word
[3984.94 → 3985.42] of God
[3985.42 → 3986.82] to those around us
[3986.82 → 3991.82] and then
[3991.82 → 3992.84] when you're
[3992.84 → 3993.74] visiting with people
[3993.74 → 3994.34] in the hospital
[3994.34 → 3995.96] or whether you're
[3995.96 → 3996.48] talking to them
[3996.48 → 3997.04] on the train
[3997.04 → 3998.56] you will always
[3998.56 → 3999.22] have something
[3999.22 → 4000.32] to say
[4000.32 → 4001.44] you'll always
[4001.44 → 4002.06] have something
[4002.06 → 4003.44] to bring up
[4003.44 → 4004.80] in fact
[4004.80 → 4005.14] I think
[4005.14 → 4006.34] scripture memorization
[4006.34 → 4007.82] actually impacts
[4007.82 → 4008.84] your prayer life
[4008.84 → 4009.74] as well
[4009.74 → 4010.22] right
[4010.22 → 4010.56] but there's
[4010.56 → 4011.10] there's
[4011.10 → 4011.52] there's
[4011.52 → 4012.32] there's something
[4012.32 → 4013.02] beautiful
[4013.02 → 4014.54] and compelling
[4014.54 → 4015.90] about praying
[4015.90 → 4016.58] the words
[4016.58 → 4017.14] of scripture
[4017.14 → 4017.94] out loud
[4017.94 → 4018.62] with a person
[4018.62 → 4019.48] in need
[4019.48 → 4019.68] right
[4019.68 → 4020.50] the voice
[4020.50 → 4021.08] of Jesus
[4021.08 → 4022.08] says so much
[4022.08 → 4022.62] more than
[4022.62 → 4023.30] the voice
[4023.30 → 4024.06] of Chris
[4024.06 → 4025.26] at that moment
[4025.26 → 4027.62] and even
[4027.62 → 4028.12] if people
[4028.12 → 4029.02] aren't familiar
[4029.02 → 4029.88] with the words
[4029.88 → 4030.50] of God
[4030.50 → 4031.68] I believe
[4031.68 → 4032.46] that there's
[4032.46 → 4033.08] something in
[4033.08 → 4033.66] their heart
[4033.66 → 4034.86] that connects
[4034.86 → 4037.08] and that hears
[4037.08 → 4038.70] in these words
[4038.70 → 4039.30] from Jesus
[4039.30 → 4041.78] now the next
[4041.78 → 4042.24] thing then
[4042.24 → 4043.52] that I want us
[4043.52 → 4043.86] to see
[4043.86 → 4044.96] from this text
[4044.96 → 4045.58] in Acts
[4045.58 → 4046.92] is that
[4046.92 → 4048.26] that while
[4048.26 → 4049.44] the primary
[4049.44 → 4050.36] point of the
[4050.36 → 4050.96] conflict
[4050.96 → 4052.28] is spiritual
[4052.28 → 4053.80] right
[4053.80 → 4055.04] the spiritual
[4055.04 → 4056.16] touches
[4056.16 → 4058.04] the material
[4058.04 → 4060.04] that what
[4060.04 → 4060.56] what happens
[4060.56 → 4061.48] in this exchange
[4061.48 → 4062.38] happens on the
[4062.38 → 4063.02] spiritual level
[4063.02 → 4064.16] but it impacts
[4064.16 → 4065.12] the physical
[4065.12 → 4065.86] level
[4065.86 → 4066.56] right
[4066.56 → 4067.30] notice what Paul
[4067.30 → 4067.54] says
[4067.54 → 4067.88] he says
[4067.88 → 4068.98] I command you
[4068.98 → 4069.46] in the name
[4069.46 → 4070.40] of Jesus Christ
[4070.40 → 4070.96] to come out
[4070.96 → 4071.22] of her
[4071.22 → 4071.70] and then Luke
[4071.70 → 4071.96] writes
[4071.96 → 4073.12] at that moment
[4073.12 → 4073.74] the spirit
[4073.74 → 4074.68] left her
[4074.68 → 4075.22] and then Luke
[4075.22 → 4075.68] tells us
[4075.68 → 4076.42] this little bit
[4076.42 → 4077.90] he says
[4077.90 → 4078.78] her owners
[4078.78 → 4079.60] realized
[4079.60 → 4080.44] that their
[4080.44 → 4081.04] hope of
[4081.04 → 4081.80] making money
[4081.80 → 4082.94] was gone
[4082.94 → 4085.80] the spiritual
[4085.80 → 4086.52] exchange
[4086.52 → 4088.04] has an impact
[4088.04 → 4089.16] on the physical
[4089.16 → 4089.86] reality
[4089.86 → 4090.90] of those who
[4090.90 → 4091.46] are involved
[4091.46 → 4092.62] right
[4092.62 → 4093.32] these owners
[4093.32 → 4094.10] had committed
[4094.10 → 4094.54] themselves
[4094.54 → 4095.70] to that spirit
[4095.70 → 4096.52] in order to
[4096.52 → 4097.06] make money
[4097.06 → 4097.80] and now
[4097.80 → 4098.46] that opportunity
[4098.46 → 4099.04] is gone
[4099.04 → 4102.02] you see
[4102.02 → 4103.04] as we said
[4103.04 → 4103.56] the gospel
[4103.56 → 4104.44] is a spiritual
[4104.44 → 4104.84] truth
[4104.84 → 4105.50] for a spiritual
[4105.50 → 4106.10] reality
[4106.10 → 4106.90] but
[4106.90 → 4107.64] it's not
[4107.64 → 4108.44] only
[4108.44 → 4110.26] a spiritual
[4110.26 → 4111.62] reality
[4111.62 → 4112.96] it's not
[4112.96 → 4113.58] only
[4113.58 → 4114.76] a spiritual
[4114.76 → 4116.08] truth
[4116.08 → 4119.46] now hear this
[4119.46 → 4119.68] okay
[4119.68 → 4120.70] because yes
[4120.70 → 4121.06] it is
[4121.06 → 4121.70] it is more
[4121.70 → 4122.24] true
[4122.24 → 4123.50] it is true
[4123.50 → 4124.08] that I am
[4124.08 → 4124.98] more sinful
[4124.98 → 4125.80] than I would
[4125.80 → 4126.46] ever admit
[4126.46 → 4127.18] or even know
[4127.18 → 4127.92] how to confess
[4127.92 → 4129.44] and it is
[4129.44 → 4129.66] true
[4129.66 → 4130.04] that my
[4130.04 → 4130.66] rebellion
[4130.66 → 4131.64] against God
[4131.64 → 4132.24] and the
[4132.24 → 4132.58] rebellion
[4132.58 → 4132.94] of our
[4132.94 → 4133.68] first parents
[4133.68 → 4134.52] Adam and Eve
[4134.52 → 4135.14] in the garden
[4135.14 → 4136.10] has broken
[4136.10 → 4137.02] my relationship
[4137.02 → 4137.52] to God
[4137.52 → 4138.56] right
[4138.56 → 4139.22] the relationship
[4139.22 → 4139.96] that all of us
[4139.96 → 4140.64] were created
[4140.64 → 4141.52] to live in
[4141.52 → 4142.48] and out of
[4142.48 → 4144.14] and now
[4144.14 → 4144.96] it's true
[4144.96 → 4145.62] that everything
[4145.62 → 4146.10] I do
[4146.10 → 4146.80] is marred
[4146.80 → 4147.58] with the stain
[4147.58 → 4149.02] of this sin
[4149.02 → 4149.66] this is the
[4149.66 → 4151.02] spiritual reality
[4151.02 → 4152.30] that I am in
[4152.30 → 4153.38] the spiritual
[4153.38 → 4154.18] reality that we
[4154.18 → 4155.22] are all in
[4155.22 → 4155.60] whether you
[4155.60 → 4156.44] believe the Bible
[4156.44 → 4157.54] is true or not
[4157.54 → 4157.74] right
[4157.74 → 4157.96] because you
[4157.96 → 4158.26] don't have to
[4158.26 → 4159.04] believe the Bible
[4159.04 → 4159.50] to be true
[4159.50 → 4160.66] for this reality
[4160.66 → 4161.58] to be true
[4161.58 → 4165.28] but it's also
[4165.28 → 4165.82] true
[4165.82 → 4167.46] it is also
[4167.46 → 4168.02] true
[4168.02 → 4168.86] that I am
[4168.86 → 4169.68] more loved
[4169.68 → 4170.28] by God
[4170.28 → 4170.66] than I could
[4170.66 → 4171.38] ever imagine
[4171.38 → 4171.90] possible
[4171.90 → 4172.94] it's also true
[4172.94 → 4173.52] that out of
[4173.52 → 4174.64] this amazing
[4174.64 → 4175.82] love for us
[4175.82 → 4176.60] God came
[4176.60 → 4177.68] into the world
[4177.68 → 4178.92] in Jesus Christ
[4178.92 → 4179.64] that Jesus
[4179.64 → 4180.32] was born
[4180.32 → 4181.14] and he lived
[4181.14 → 4182.02] a life of
[4182.02 → 4183.12] perfect righteousness
[4183.12 → 4184.14] keeping the
[4184.14 → 4184.88] commands of the
[4184.88 → 4185.14] law
[4185.14 → 4186.08] and pleasing
[4186.08 → 4187.36] God perfectly
[4187.36 → 4188.72] in our place
[4188.72 → 4189.76] and that the
[4189.76 → 4190.44] same Jesus
[4190.44 → 4191.18] even though
[4191.18 → 4192.10] he was perfect
[4192.10 → 4193.28] died the death
[4193.28 → 4194.24] that I deserved
[4194.24 → 4195.26] died the death
[4195.26 → 4195.84] that I deserve
[4195.84 → 4196.42] as the wrath
[4196.42 → 4196.84] of God
[4196.84 → 4198.10] for my sin
[4198.10 → 4199.94] right on the cross
[4199.94 → 4200.78] Jesus took
[4200.78 → 4202.20] your punishment
[4202.20 → 4204.10] he bore the wrath
[4204.10 → 4204.78] of God
[4204.78 → 4205.40] for the broken
[4205.40 → 4206.16] relationship
[4206.16 → 4207.06] that we now
[4207.06 → 4208.10] live out of
[4208.10 → 4208.80] in order to
[4208.80 → 4209.68] restore that
[4209.68 → 4210.18] relationship
[4210.18 → 4210.82] because three
[4210.82 → 4211.50] days later
[4211.50 → 4212.70] this same Jesus
[4212.70 → 4213.46] was raised
[4213.46 → 4214.48] from the dead
[4214.48 → 4215.12] victorious
[4215.12 → 4216.10] defeating death
[4216.10 → 4217.24] defeating the devil
[4217.24 → 4218.42] he was raised
[4218.42 → 4218.96] in victory
[4218.96 → 4219.58] and now he
[4219.58 → 4220.30] grants us
[4220.30 → 4221.26] new life
[4221.26 → 4222.06] through the spirit
[4222.06 → 4224.14] and so now
[4224.14 → 4226.24] I have a new
[4226.24 → 4228.30] spiritual reality
[4228.30 → 4229.24] by grace
[4229.24 → 4230.10] through faith
[4230.10 → 4230.68] but it's a
[4230.68 → 4231.82] spiritual reality
[4231.82 → 4233.24] that directly
[4233.24 → 4234.08] touches
[4234.08 → 4236.28] the physical
[4236.28 → 4237.36] reality of my life
[4237.36 → 4239.16] and every moment
[4239.16 → 4240.40] I see
[4240.40 → 4241.02] because you see
[4241.02 → 4243.16] since Jesus
[4243.16 → 4243.96] is raised
[4243.96 → 4244.88] from the dead
[4244.88 → 4245.96] that changes
[4245.96 → 4247.04] everything
[4247.04 → 4248.58] since Jesus
[4248.58 → 4249.20] has ascended
[4249.20 → 4250.08] to the right hand
[4250.08 → 4251.36] of God the Father
[4251.36 → 4252.24] and he sits
[4252.24 → 4252.90] as Lord
[4252.90 → 4254.26] over all the universe
[4254.26 → 4254.86] that changes
[4254.86 → 4255.56] everything
[4255.56 → 4257.10] about how we live
[4257.10 → 4257.58] here
[4257.58 → 4258.90] and now
[4258.90 → 4260.96] right the gospel
[4260.96 → 4261.94] is the truth
[4261.94 → 4262.76] of Jesus
[4262.76 → 4264.02] and by living
[4264.02 → 4265.56] by the gospel
[4265.56 → 4266.58] and living
[4266.58 → 4267.44] by the gospel
[4267.44 → 4268.40] is living
[4268.40 → 4269.44] in the trust
[4269.44 → 4270.84] of Jesus
[4270.84 → 4273.48] and that's what it means
[4273.48 → 4274.22] to be Christian
[4274.22 → 4275.52] right
[4275.52 → 4276.34] to be Christian
[4276.34 → 4277.54] theologically
[4277.54 → 4279.16] theological definition
[4279.16 → 4280.02] of being a Christian
[4280.02 → 4280.86] means to share
[4280.86 → 4282.02] in the anointing
[4282.02 → 4282.98] of Christ
[4282.98 → 4284.42] right
[4284.42 → 4284.98] to share
[4284.98 → 4285.72] in the anointing
[4285.72 → 4286.16] of Christ
[4286.16 → 4287.56] to be restored
[4287.56 → 4288.52] in relationship
[4288.52 → 4289.32] to the Father
[4289.32 → 4290.94] and to be a Christian
[4290.94 → 4291.56] practically
[4291.56 → 4292.48] the way that
[4292.48 → 4293.60] theological truth
[4293.60 → 4294.22] works out
[4294.22 → 4294.62] the way that
[4294.62 → 4295.64] spiritual reality
[4295.64 → 4296.80] is worked out
[4296.80 → 4297.36] in our life
[4297.36 → 4298.22] is to trust
[4298.22 → 4299.48] Jesus more
[4299.48 → 4300.28] than you trust
[4300.28 → 4300.80] yourself
[4300.80 → 4305.92] by grace
[4305.92 → 4306.64] through faith
[4306.64 → 4307.76] we share
[4307.76 → 4308.70] in the anointing
[4308.70 → 4310.14] of Christ
[4310.14 → 4311.42] and so
[4311.42 → 4312.12] the life
[4312.12 → 4312.60] we are called
[4312.60 → 4313.08] to live
[4313.08 → 4313.50] is one
[4313.50 → 4314.26] that trusts
[4314.26 → 4316.14] in him
[4316.14 → 4318.88] and when our lives
[4318.88 → 4319.48] are characterized
[4319.48 → 4320.50] by this kind
[4320.50 → 4321.40] of trust
[4321.40 → 4322.70] right
[4322.70 → 4323.92] that's a reality
[4323.92 → 4324.92] defining
[4324.92 → 4325.92] power
[4325.92 → 4326.78] and of course
[4326.80 → 4327.46] then
[4327.46 → 4328.08] the physical
[4328.08 → 4328.66] reality
[4328.66 → 4329.18] of the world
[4329.18 → 4329.66] that we live
[4329.66 → 4329.82] in
[4329.82 → 4330.38] of course
[4330.38 → 4330.82] the world
[4330.82 → 4331.40] that we're part
[4331.40 → 4331.54] of
[4331.54 → 4332.40] is impacted
[4332.40 → 4333.34] by the spiritual
[4333.34 → 4334.08] truth of God
[4334.08 → 4335.66] because it's a reality
[4335.66 → 4336.80] defining truth
[4336.80 → 4338.18] that's what Jesus does
[4338.18 → 4339.76] he spoke reality
[4339.76 → 4340.78] into beginning
[4340.78 → 4341.98] or into existence
[4341.98 → 4342.80] at the beginning
[4342.80 → 4344.00] and he continues
[4344.00 → 4345.00] to speak
[4345.00 → 4345.60] the truth
[4345.60 → 4346.26] of his word
[4346.26 → 4347.34] recreating you
[4347.34 → 4348.28] transforming you
[4348.28 → 4349.86] into his image
[4349.86 → 4351.04] by that same
[4351.04 → 4351.70] word
[4351.70 → 4352.44] right now
[4352.44 → 4353.46] right here
[4353.46 → 4354.12] today
[4354.12 → 4356.02] and that
[4356.02 → 4356.90] changes
[4356.90 → 4358.10] everything
[4358.10 → 4361.38] and here's
[4361.38 → 4361.80] the thing
[4361.80 → 4364.10] because this is
[4364.10 → 4364.70] where that starts
[4364.70 → 4365.44] to rub
[4365.44 → 4366.46] up against
[4366.46 → 4367.30] the sort
[4367.30 → 4368.04] of nebulous
[4368.04 → 4369.14] and anemic
[4369.14 → 4370.82] idea of spirituality
[4370.82 → 4371.56] in the world
[4371.56 → 4371.92] today
[4371.92 → 4373.52] right people
[4373.52 → 4374.44] in our world
[4374.44 → 4374.76] today
[4374.76 → 4377.02] are rediscovering
[4377.02 → 4378.14] spirituality
[4378.14 → 4379.40] right
[4379.40 → 4380.62] 20 years ago
[4380.62 → 4381.06] or so
[4381.06 → 4381.96] when the so-called
[4381.96 → 4382.88] new atheist movement
[4382.88 → 4383.78] was in full swing
[4383.78 → 4384.66] everyone was saying
[4384.66 → 4385.26] this is the end
[4385.26 → 4385.68] of religion
[4385.68 → 4386.30] this is the end
[4386.30 → 4387.06] of spirituality
[4387.06 → 4388.10] right
[4388.10 → 4389.56] reason will finally reign
[4389.56 → 4390.56] and guess what
[4390.56 → 4391.42] that didn't happen
[4391.42 → 4393.44] people are looking
[4393.44 → 4394.82] to re-enchant
[4394.82 → 4395.40] the world
[4395.40 → 4396.56] to find a magic
[4396.56 → 4397.16] again
[4397.16 → 4397.80] and a power
[4397.80 → 4398.20] again
[4398.20 → 4399.18] in this world
[4399.18 → 4399.62] they're looking
[4399.62 → 4400.42] to rediscover
[4400.42 → 4401.32] spirituality
[4401.32 → 4402.12] but the spirituality
[4402.12 → 4403.66] that's being discovered
[4403.66 → 4404.94] apart from the gospel
[4404.94 → 4407.46] is one that isn't
[4407.46 → 4408.82] satisfying
[4408.82 → 4409.66] in fact people
[4409.66 → 4410.48] are looking
[4410.48 → 4411.46] for a spirituality
[4411.46 → 4413.38] that doesn't change
[4413.38 → 4414.14] too much
[4414.14 → 4415.20] about their lives
[4415.20 → 4417.44] right people
[4417.44 → 4418.64] want to be spiritual
[4418.64 → 4420.36] as long as all it does
[4420.36 → 4421.28] is brought them peace
[4421.28 → 4422.20] and comfort
[4422.20 → 4426.92] but Jesus will not
[4426.92 → 4428.76] he cannot
[4428.76 → 4430.22] share the throne
[4430.22 → 4431.24] of your heart
[4431.24 → 4433.26] so if
[4433.26 → 4434.34] in your heart of hearts
[4434.34 → 4435.42] you really love
[4435.42 → 4435.88] business
[4435.88 → 4436.70] or you really love
[4436.70 → 4437.34] making money
[4437.34 → 4438.26] and the status
[4438.26 → 4439.18] that that gives you
[4439.18 → 4439.96] in society
[4439.96 → 4441.24] but when Jesus
[4441.24 → 4442.12] starts pushing
[4442.12 → 4443.14] on that trigger
[4443.14 → 4444.74] you have a choice
[4444.74 → 4445.24] to make
[4445.24 → 4447.64] do you submit
[4447.64 → 4448.54] and do you trust
[4448.54 → 4449.16] Jesus
[4449.16 → 4450.16] more than you
[4450.16 → 4450.84] trust yourself
[4450.84 → 4452.30] or
[4452.30 → 4453.44] do you push him
[4453.44 → 4453.84] back
[4453.84 → 4455.64] and hold him
[4455.64 → 4456.32] at arm's length
[4456.32 → 4459.44] the people
[4459.44 → 4460.12] in our story
[4460.12 → 4460.82] pushed back
[4460.82 → 4462.66] they took Paul
[4462.66 → 4463.30] and Silas
[4463.30 → 4463.98] to the marketplace
[4463.98 → 4465.26] and they had a trial
[4465.26 → 4466.98] the charge
[4466.98 → 4467.92] was that
[4467.92 → 4468.50] these men
[4468.50 → 4469.24] are Jews
[4469.24 → 4469.64] and they're
[4469.64 → 4470.40] throwing our city
[4470.40 → 4471.18] into an uproar
[4471.18 → 4471.90] by advocating
[4471.90 → 4472.48] customs
[4472.48 → 4473.36] unlawful
[4473.36 → 4473.92] for Romans
[4473.92 → 4474.62] to accept
[4474.62 → 4475.64] or practice
[4475.64 → 4477.22] now that the charge
[4477.22 → 4477.98] was that these men
[4477.98 → 4478.50] are Jews
[4478.50 → 4479.56] and that's disturbing
[4479.56 → 4480.00] the peace
[4480.00 → 4481.00] also I think
[4481.00 → 4481.88] underscores the point
[4481.88 → 4482.52] that it's probably
[4482.52 → 4483.42] just a small
[4483.42 → 4484.42] Jewish population
[4484.42 → 4485.02] a very small
[4485.02 → 4485.80] Jewish population
[4485.80 → 4486.96] in Philippi
[4486.96 → 4488.24] and the kinds
[4488.24 → 4488.92] of things
[4488.92 → 4490.48] that upset
[4490.48 → 4491.46] the customs
[4491.46 → 4493.38] and the practices
[4493.38 → 4494.50] and behaviours
[4494.50 → 4495.12] lawful
[4495.12 → 4495.80] to Romans
[4495.80 → 4496.46] unlawful
[4496.46 → 4497.02] for Romans
[4497.02 → 4497.92] is
[4497.92 → 4499.14] worshipping
[4499.14 → 4500.22] one God
[4500.22 → 4500.82] alone
[4500.82 → 4502.38] or is
[4502.38 → 4503.54] for instance
[4503.54 → 4505.06] participating
[4505.06 → 4506.32] in the Lord's
[4506.32 → 4506.56] Supper
[4506.56 → 4507.60] right
[4507.60 → 4508.18] one of the early
[4508.18 → 4508.70] Christian
[4508.70 → 4509.80] or one of the charges
[4509.80 → 4510.50] that Romans
[4510.50 → 4511.26] gave to the early
[4511.26 → 4511.66] Christians
[4511.66 → 4512.42] was that we
[4512.42 → 4513.20] are cannibals
[4513.20 → 4514.98] because Jesus
[4514.98 → 4515.44] says
[4515.44 → 4517.06] eat my flesh
[4517.06 → 4518.52] and drink my blood
[4518.52 → 4519.20] and we participate
[4519.20 → 4520.00] in the Lord's Supper
[4520.00 → 4520.94] but these are
[4520.94 → 4522.06] unlawful customs
[4522.06 → 4523.22] for the Romans
[4523.22 → 4524.18] to accept
[4524.18 → 4526.18] now
[4526.18 → 4527.48] in Greek
[4527.48 → 4528.52] and Roman cities
[4528.52 → 4529.82] the marketplace
[4529.82 → 4531.98] is a gathering place
[4531.98 → 4532.66] it's a place
[4532.66 → 4533.42] where all the people
[4533.42 → 4534.00] would come
[4534.00 → 4535.48] and make exchanges
[4535.48 → 4536.08] where they would
[4536.08 → 4536.70] come to hear
[4536.70 → 4537.90] and receive the
[4537.90 → 4538.76] news reports
[4538.76 → 4539.54] and the updates
[4539.54 → 4540.68] it's the place
[4540.68 → 4541.64] where the leaders
[4541.64 → 4542.28] would gather
[4542.28 → 4542.94] and they would have
[4542.94 → 4544.14] their days
[4544.14 → 4544.96] where they could sit
[4544.96 → 4545.90] and hold trial
[4545.90 → 4547.20] and so that's
[4547.20 → 4548.72] that is where they go
[4548.72 → 4549.54] makes sense
[4549.54 → 4550.34] culturally
[4550.34 → 4551.68] we don't have
[4551.68 → 4552.28] a marketplace
[4552.28 → 4553.62] like that anymore
[4553.62 → 4554.24] right
[4554.24 → 4554.90] it's not like
[4554.90 → 4556.10] after church
[4556.10 → 4556.60] we're all going to
[4556.60 → 4557.62] go up to Ralph's
[4557.62 → 4558.36] in order to hear
[4558.36 → 4559.00] the announcements
[4559.00 → 4559.76] of what's happening
[4559.76 → 4560.52] in the week to come
[4560.52 → 4562.82] but
[4562.82 → 4564.88] market economics
[4564.88 → 4567.14] or our ideas
[4567.14 → 4568.00] of wealth
[4568.00 → 4569.54] are still
[4569.54 → 4570.48] significant
[4570.48 → 4571.28] drivers
[4571.28 → 4572.88] of what we are
[4572.88 → 4573.56] now seeing
[4573.56 → 4574.68] is a spiritual
[4574.68 → 4575.98] conflict
[4575.98 → 4577.46] right
[4577.46 → 4578.14] Jesus himself
[4578.14 → 4578.64] says
[4578.64 → 4579.32] where your
[4579.32 → 4580.14] treasure is
[4580.14 → 4580.64] there your
[4580.64 → 4581.42] heart will be
[4581.42 → 4582.10] also
[4582.10 → 4583.98] and so the reality
[4583.98 → 4585.26] of worshipping money
[4585.26 → 4586.96] is still one of the
[4586.96 → 4587.90] chief idols
[4587.90 → 4588.62] of course
[4588.62 → 4589.72] in our world
[4589.72 → 4590.12] today
[4590.12 → 4591.60] and in this story
[4591.60 → 4593.38] we read in verse 22
[4593.38 → 4594.34] that the crowd
[4594.34 → 4595.46] joined in the attack
[4595.46 → 4596.12] against Paul
[4596.12 → 4596.72] and Silas
[4596.72 → 4597.46] and the magistrates
[4597.46 → 4598.22] ordered them to be
[4598.22 → 4598.98] stripped and beaten
[4598.98 → 4599.56] with rods
[4599.56 → 4600.94] and after they had
[4600.94 → 4602.06] been severely flogged
[4602.06 → 4602.60] they were thrown
[4602.60 → 4603.18] into prison
[4603.18 → 4603.96] and a jailer
[4603.96 → 4604.68] was commanded
[4604.68 → 4605.52] to guard them
[4605.52 → 4606.22] carefully
[4606.22 → 4609.04] see not only
[4609.04 → 4610.26] does proclaim
[4610.26 → 4610.80] the gospel
[4610.80 → 4611.40] brush up
[4611.40 → 4612.24] against the spirit
[4612.24 → 4612.94] of the age
[4612.94 → 4614.74] and have an impact
[4614.74 → 4615.58] on the physical
[4615.58 → 4616.82] reality of the world
[4616.82 → 4617.52] around them
[4617.52 → 4619.84] proclaiming the gospel
[4619.84 → 4620.82] has an impact
[4620.82 → 4621.80] on the physical
[4621.80 → 4622.92] reality of those
[4622.92 → 4623.88] who proclaim
[4623.88 → 4624.74] the gospel
[4624.74 → 4626.06] of those who speak it
[4626.06 → 4627.04] right
[4627.04 → 4627.78] this is an example
[4627.78 → 4628.86] of Paul
[4628.86 → 4629.88] in persecution
[4629.88 → 4631.02] that he was
[4631.02 → 4631.74] familiar with
[4631.74 → 4633.28] this is an example
[4633.28 → 4634.22] of what happens
[4634.22 → 4635.64] when the spirits
[4635.64 → 4636.84] of the age
[4636.84 → 4637.92] are in a battle
[4637.92 → 4639.52] with the most high God
[4639.52 → 4641.98] and Jesus warned
[4641.98 → 4643.52] he said to his disciples
[4643.52 → 4645.72] that you would have
[4645.72 → 4647.78] trouble in this world
[4647.78 → 4648.68] Jesus warned
[4648.68 → 4649.94] he said to his disciples
[4649.94 → 4650.90] that whoever wants
[4650.90 → 4651.46] to be holy
[4651.46 → 4652.38] will be persecuted
[4652.38 → 4653.52] Jesus warned
[4653.52 → 4654.20] his disciples
[4654.20 → 4655.02] and he said to them
[4655.02 → 4656.42] the world will hate you
[4656.42 → 4658.06] because it hated me first
[4658.06 → 4660.68] and for Paul
[4660.68 → 4662.42] and for some of us
[4662.42 → 4663.48] more than others
[4663.48 → 4664.32] for Christians
[4664.32 → 4665.42] in places
[4665.42 → 4666.82] perhaps other than
[4666.82 → 4668.10] this one right here
[4668.10 → 4669.88] this is the ordinary
[4669.88 → 4672.20] cost of discipleship
[4672.20 → 4674.02] this is what it means
[4674.02 → 4675.22] to take up your cross
[4675.22 → 4675.96] and to follow
[4675.96 → 4677.64] after him
[4677.64 → 4679.50] now
[4679.50 → 4682.08] don't hear what I'm not saying
[4682.08 → 4682.40] because
[4682.40 → 4683.62] I pray
[4683.62 → 4686.10] that this never happens
[4686.10 → 4686.64] to us
[4686.64 → 4688.72] I pray
[4688.72 → 4689.22] that we never
[4689.22 → 4689.94] have to endure
[4689.94 → 4691.56] this kind of
[4691.56 → 4692.54] reality
[4692.54 → 4697.06] but it might
[4697.06 → 4699.92] and if it does
[4699.92 → 4702.78] I don't want it said
[4702.78 → 4704.40] of Langley Emanuel Church
[4704.40 → 4705.44] that we weren't ready
[4705.44 → 4708.32] that we didn't expect it
[4708.32 → 4709.58] right
[4709.58 → 4710.38] I'm praying
[4710.38 → 4712.06] that we are ready
[4712.06 → 4713.82] and then notice
[4713.82 → 4714.18] here
[4714.18 → 4714.44] right
[4714.44 → 4715.10] as we get
[4715.10 → 4715.74] ready
[4715.74 → 4716.90] as we are
[4716.90 → 4717.40] prepared
[4717.40 → 4717.84] notice
[4717.84 → 4719.74] what Paul and Silas do
[4719.74 → 4722.06] they're in jail
[4722.06 → 4722.86] in prison
[4722.86 → 4723.82] in stocks
[4723.82 → 4725.30] their feet are bound
[4725.30 → 4726.76] about midnight
[4726.76 → 4728.22] Paul and Silas
[4728.22 → 4728.88] were praying
[4728.88 → 4729.92] and singing
[4729.92 → 4730.86] hymns
[4730.86 → 4731.76] to God
[4731.76 → 4734.34] now earlier
[4734.34 → 4734.80] I said
[4734.80 → 4735.44] the way that we
[4735.44 → 4736.36] fight this battle
[4736.36 → 4736.96] is to pray
[4736.96 → 4737.54] in the spirit
[4737.54 → 4738.60] on all occasions
[4738.60 → 4740.06] armed with the word
[4740.06 → 4740.72] of God
[4740.72 → 4743.74] and to sing
[4743.74 → 4747.18] and to sing
[4747.18 → 4749.54] brothers and sisters
[4749.54 → 4750.94] the gospel
[4750.94 → 4752.10] the gospel
[4752.10 → 4753.22] pushes back
[4753.22 → 4755.18] against the spirit
[4755.18 → 4755.82] of this age
[4755.82 → 4757.88] prayer
[4757.88 → 4758.94] pushes back
[4758.94 → 4760.12] against the spirit
[4760.12 → 4761.04] of this age
[4761.04 → 4762.72] the word of God
[4762.72 → 4763.28] proclaimed
[4763.28 → 4764.28] pushes back
[4764.28 → 4765.40] against the spirit
[4765.40 → 4766.38] of this age
[4766.38 → 4767.64] songs
[4767.64 → 4768.14] hymns
[4768.14 → 4769.30] and spiritual songs
[4769.30 → 4770.26] push back
[4770.26 → 4771.40] against the spirit
[4771.40 → 4772.48] of this age
[4772.48 → 4774.98] this is what it looks like
[4774.98 → 4775.92] to find strength
[4775.92 → 4776.72] in God
[4776.72 → 4777.36] in the face
[4777.36 → 4777.96] of trial
[4777.96 → 4779.00] and persecution
[4779.00 → 4780.24] and so
[4780.24 → 4781.28] I pray
[4781.28 → 4782.76] will you push
[4782.76 → 4784.16] with me
[4784.16 → 4787.40] push back
[4787.40 → 4788.24] against the spirit
[4788.24 → 4788.82] of this age
[4788.82 → 4790.08] that confuses
[4790.08 → 4790.78] rather than
[4790.78 → 4791.64] clarifies
[4791.64 → 4792.30] push back
[4792.30 → 4792.88] against the spirit
[4792.88 → 4793.36] of this age
[4793.36 → 4794.10] that divides
[4794.10 → 4794.88] rather than
[4794.88 → 4795.70] pulls together
[4795.70 → 4796.50] push back
[4796.50 → 4797.16] against the spirit
[4797.16 → 4797.70] of this age
[4797.70 → 4798.32] that wants to
[4798.32 → 4799.36] separate children
[4799.36 → 4799.96] from parents
[4799.96 → 4800.40] and parents
[4800.40 → 4800.86] from children
[4800.86 → 4801.66] push back
[4801.66 → 4802.26] against the spirit
[4802.26 → 4802.74] of this age
[4802.74 → 4803.02] that says
[4803.02 → 4804.00] you are not
[4804.00 → 4804.68] worthy
[4804.68 → 4805.54] you are not
[4805.54 → 4806.18] valued
[4806.18 → 4807.02] you are not
[4807.02 → 4807.56] loved
[4807.56 → 4808.14] push back
[4808.14 → 4808.86] against the spirit
[4808.86 → 4809.50] of this age
[4809.50 → 4810.04] that seeks
[4810.04 → 4810.54] to sow
[4810.54 → 4811.20] chaos
[4811.20 → 4812.16] and discord
[4812.16 → 4813.24] push back
[4813.24 → 4814.52] with a song
[4814.52 → 4816.04] push back
[4816.04 → 4816.68] with the word
[4816.68 → 4817.14] of God
[4817.14 → 4817.68] proclaimed
[4817.68 → 4818.50] push back
[4818.50 → 4819.68] by being deeply
[4819.68 → 4821.04] in prayer
[4821.04 → 4823.04] make no mistake
[4823.04 → 4823.54] about it
[4823.54 → 4824.50] we are in
[4824.50 → 4825.60] a spiritual battle
[4825.60 → 4826.50] but it is a spiritual
[4826.50 → 4827.36] battle that is being
[4827.36 → 4828.20] worked out here
[4828.20 → 4828.92] and now
[4828.92 → 4829.80] in the soil
[4829.80 → 4830.84] of this earth
[4830.84 → 4834.92] but our good God
[4834.92 → 4837.20] has given us
[4837.20 → 4837.80] his gospel
[4837.80 → 4840.34] and by that gospel
[4840.34 → 4840.98] he has given us
[4840.98 → 4841.76] Jesus Christ
[4841.76 → 4843.66] and our good God
[4843.66 → 4844.18] in giving us
[4844.18 → 4844.80] Jesus Christ
[4844.80 → 4846.10] has promised us
[4846.10 → 4847.64] the spirit
[4847.64 → 4850.16] not a spirit
[4850.16 → 4852.58] the spirit
[4852.58 → 4853.50] the one
[4853.50 → 4854.96] that rules
[4854.96 → 4857.36] over all
[4857.36 → 4858.48] that is
[4858.48 → 4859.80] our God
[4859.80 → 4860.26] he
[4860.26 → 4861.30] is
[4861.30 → 4862.06] our
[4862.06 → 4862.78] God
[4862.78 → 4863.48] and I don't know
[4863.48 → 4863.98] about you
[4863.98 → 4865.70] but that makes me
[4865.70 → 4866.20] want to sing
[4866.20 → 4867.08] amen
[4867.08 → 4868.52] amen
[4868.52 → 4869.06] let's
[4869.06 → 4869.98] sing
[4869.98 → 4870.80] together
[4870.80 → 4871.18] and in fact
[4871.18 → 4871.70] I'm going to invite
[4871.70 → 4872.62] you all to stand
[4872.62 → 4873.82] I'm going to pray
[4873.82 → 4875.10] and as
[4875.10 → 4877.00] we finish our prayer
[4877.00 → 4877.90] the worship team
[4877.90 → 4878.92] is going to take us
[4878.92 → 4879.30] right
[4879.30 → 4880.36] into
[4880.36 → 4881.44] song
[4881.44 → 4882.98] and it is by this song
[4882.98 → 4884.62] sung that we push back
[4884.62 → 4885.78] against the spirit
[4885.78 → 4886.44] of the age
[4886.44 → 4887.48] it is by the gospel
[4887.48 → 4889.20] proclaimed that we push back
[4889.20 → 4890.10] and so
[4890.10 → 4890.96] sing
[4890.96 → 4892.34] and pray
[4892.34 → 4893.70] and proclaim
[4893.70 → 4894.80] together
[4894.80 → 4895.38] let's
[4895.38 → 4896.20] pray
[4896.20 → 4899.26] Lord
[4899.26 → 4900.12] our
[4900.12 → 4901.42] God
[4901.42 → 4904.70] Lord
[4904.70 → 4905.24] our God
[4905.24 → 4906.04] you are
[4906.04 → 4906.94] in this
[4906.94 → 4907.74] place
[4907.74 → 4908.70] by your
[4908.70 → 4909.48] spirit
[4909.48 → 4910.14] you are
[4910.14 → 4910.58] here
[4910.58 → 4911.34] amongst us
[4911.34 → 4911.98] Lord Jesus
[4911.98 → 4912.86] your name
[4912.86 → 4913.96] is proclaimed
[4913.96 → 4914.66] and so
[4914.66 → 4915.76] we push
[4915.76 → 4916.50] back
[4916.50 → 4917.24] against the
[4917.24 → 4917.48] spirits
[4917.48 → 4918.42] we enter
[4918.42 → 4919.08] into
[4919.08 → 4920.30] the battle
[4920.30 → 4920.96] the battle
[4920.96 → 4921.44] that you
[4921.44 → 4922.22] have won
[4922.22 → 4923.62] the victory
[4923.62 → 4924.12] that you
[4924.12 → 4925.00] have promised
[4925.00 → 4926.84] and we
[4926.84 → 4927.66] sing
[4927.66 → 4928.68] your
[4928.68 → 4929.80] praise
[4929.80 → 4933.64] even as
[4933.64 → 4934.28] the rain
[4934.28 → 4934.94] falls
[4934.94 → 4936.10] washing
[4936.10 → 4937.16] the earth
[4937.16 → 4938.26] wash us
[4938.26 → 4938.96] by your
[4938.96 → 4939.42] spirit
[4939.42 → 4940.26] renew
[4940.26 → 4940.90] us
[4940.90 → 4941.60] by your
[4941.60 → 4941.88] spirit
[4941.88 → 4942.30] that we
[4942.30 → 4942.80] might be
[4942.80 → 4943.38] sent from
[4943.38 → 4944.16] this place
[4944.16 → 4945.02] a mighty
[4945.02 → 4945.86] army
[4945.86 → 4946.72] for the
[4946.72 → 4946.98] Lord
[4946.98 → 4947.60] in Jesus
[4947.60 → 4947.98] name
[4947.98 → 4948.50] we pray
[4948.50 → 4949.74] amen
[4955.00 → 4962.44] men
[4962.44 → 4963.00] oh
[4963.00 → 4964.04] I store
[4964.04 → 4964.52] praise
[4964.52 → 4965.16] of them
[4965.38 → 4969.82] i
[4969.82 → 4976.16] I know days that God has numbered
[4976.16 → 4980.78] I will sing in all within
[4980.78 → 4986.20] Yet I look for worldly treasure
[4986.20 → 4989.94] And forsake the King
[4989.94 → 4996.48] But my ears grow fit by Redeemer
[4996.48 → 5001.20] Though I know His love is sure
[5001.20 → 5006.24] For Christ has made for everyday
[5006.24 → 5011.74] I am His forevermore
[5011.74 → 5019.12] Mine are tears in times of sorrow
[5019.12 → 5023.48] Darkness, blood and understood
[5023.48 → 5028.98] Through the valley I must travel
[5028.98 → 5033.24] Where I see no earthly good
[5033.24 → 5039.04] But my His peace and hope from heaven
[5039.04 → 5043.20] And the strength in time will be
[5043.20 → 5048.70] I know my pain will not be wasted
[5048.70 → 5052.96] Christ, oh please, His word will be
[5052.96 → 5060.70] Nine are days here as a stranger
[5060.70 → 5065.96] Pilgrim on a narrow way
[5065.96 → 5071.46] One with Christ I will encounter
[5071.46 → 5075.96] Heart and hatred for His pain
[5075.96 → 5081.24] But my His armour for this battle
[5081.24 → 5085.46] Strong enough to last long
[5085.46 → 5090.96] And He has said He will deliver
[5090.96 → 5095.22] Simply to the golden shore
[5095.22 → 5100.22] And mine are keys to Zion City
[5100.22 → 5104.96] Where beside the King I was
[5104.96 → 5110.46] For there my heart has found its treasure
[5110.46 → 5114.72] Christ is mine forevermore
[5114.72 → 5138.48] Come rejoice now, O my soul
[5138.48 → 5143.98] For His love is my reward
[5143.98 → 5148.48] For His love is my reward
[5148.48 → 5153.48] Christ is mine forevermore
[5153.48 → 5155.48] Come rejoice now, O my soul
[5155.48 → 5158.48] Come rejoice now, O my soul
[5158.48 → 5163.48] For His love is my reward
[5163.48 → 5167.48] Fear is gone and hope is sure
[5167.48 → 5172.48] Christ is mine forevermore
[5172.48 → 5173.48] Christ is mine forevermore
[5173.48 → 5179.48] Christ is mine forevermore
[5179.48 → 5182.48] And mine are keys to Zion City
[5182.48 → 5202.46] Where beside the King I was
[5202.46 → 5203.46] Be not walk
[5203.46 → 5209.46] For there my heart has found its treasure
[5209.46 → 5214.46] Christ is mine forevermore
[5214.46 → 5220.46] Christ is mine forevermore
[5220.46 → 5225.46] Christ is mine forevermore
[5225.46 → 5240.00] As you go this week, know that you go into battle, but know that God goes with you.
[5241.16 → 5247.82] And know that God is not surprised by whatever you face, but he has ordained your steps that
[5247.82 → 5254.46] you would be there. And so he is with you for the journey. He is with you for the battle. He is in
[5254.46 → 5261.44] you in the Spirit, and so receive God's blessing. Following God's blessing, we're going to sing
[5261.44 → 5266.72] another song, and there's a chance to be prayed with or over. We'll have someone up front here
[5266.72 → 5271.06] with a yellow name tag. They would love to meet you and pray with you. Go as well with an invitation
[5271.06 → 5277.48] to join us again at 7 p.m. for our lament and longing service together, and go with a gentle
[5277.48 → 5281.58] reminder that after you've finished your coffee and your fellowship, that stacking chairs would
[5281.58 → 5290.20] be appreciated. That's part of the battle today. Receive the blessing of God. God, go before you
[5290.20 → 5297.32] to lead you. God, go behind you to protect you. God, go beneath you to support you, and God, go beside
[5297.32 → 5305.54] you to defend you. Do not be afraid. Let the blessing of God come upon you today. Do not be afraid,
[5305.54 → 5311.40] but go in peace to love and serve the Lord. Amen.
[5311.40 → 5311.58] Amen.
[5341.40 → 5353.14] be
[5353.14 → 5368.14] Be gracious to you, Lord, turn his face for you and give you peace.
