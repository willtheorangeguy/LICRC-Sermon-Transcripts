[0.00 --> 18.96]  I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I'm not enough
[18.96 --> 30.96]  Every single lie that tells me I will never measure
[30.96 --> 44.80]  Am I more than just the sum of every heart and every love
[48.96 --> 57.84]  Remind me once again just who I am because I need to know
[57.84 --> 67.86]  You say I'm loved when I can't feel a thing
[67.86 --> 74.38]  You say I'm strong when I think I'm weak
[74.38 --> 80.88]  And you say I am held when I am falling short
[80.88 --> 87.56]  And when I don't belong, oh, you say I am yours
[87.56 --> 93.94]  And I believe, oh, I believe
[93.94 --> 100.44]  What you say of me, I believe
[100.44 --> 110.24]  The only thing that matters now is everything you think of me
[110.24 --> 122.14]  In you I find my worth, in you I find my identity
[122.14 --> 132.56]  You say I'm loved when I can't feel a thing
[132.56 --> 139.22]  You say I'm strong when I think I'm weak
[139.22 --> 145.84]  And you say I am held when I am falling short
[145.84 --> 152.34]  When I don't belong, oh, you say I am yours
[152.34 --> 158.84]  And I believe, oh, I believe
[158.84 --> 165.34]  What you say of me, oh, I believe
[165.34 --> 177.84]  Taking all I have and now I'm laying it at your feet
[177.84 --> 186.88]  You have every failure, God
[186.88 --> 190.34]  You have every victory
[190.34 --> 200.80]  Oh, you say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
[200.80 --> 207.30]  You say I am strong when I think I'm weak
[207.30 --> 213.86]  You say I am held when I am falling short
[213.86 --> 220.50]  When I don't belong, oh, you say I'm yours.
[221.50 --> 230.30]  And I believe, oh, I believe what you say of me.
[230.30 --> 243.70]  I believe, oh, I believe, yes, I believe what you say of me.
[243.86 --> 273.84]  I believe, oh, I believe what you say of me.
[273.84 --> 276.04]  Welcome to Langley Emanuel CRC.
[276.12 --> 277.02]  My name is Kevin Lowbert.
[277.44 --> 283.42]  I'm the youth pastor here at this church, and it's great to be able to gather in God's presence together this morning.
[283.92 --> 286.34]  A few announcements this morning before we get underway.
[286.48 --> 298.54]  The first is that Lent starts this week, and to kick Lent off, we will be having an Ash Wednesday service this coming Wednesday at a fairly unique time.
[298.66 --> 301.82]  So the Ash Wednesday service this week will be at 7 a.m.
[301.82 --> 308.82]  So the first thing we can do on Wednesday here at church before work, before school, before whatever you're doing is to come together.
[309.24 --> 314.50]  It'll be 30 minutes, and we'll worship God and get into the right posture for the Lent season.
[314.60 --> 317.76]  So hopefully you can come on out this Wednesday at 7 a.m. for that service.
[318.64 --> 327.18]  Later this month, our congregation is joining with a number of other churches to raise money for Gateway of Hope in an event called Coldest Night of the Year.
[327.18 --> 328.66]  So thank you, Linda.
[329.06 --> 330.74]  And so a team of us are getting together.
[331.08 --> 334.46]  We are going to walk a five-kilometer walk on the 24th.
[334.50 --> 337.92]  It starts at Gateway of Hope, and it's a loop, and it'll end at Gateway of Hope.
[338.58 --> 340.64]  And you are all invited to join this team.
[341.10 --> 342.92]  You can do so by checking out the bulletin.
[342.98 --> 345.30]  You can come talk to myself or any of the other staff.
[345.76 --> 354.28]  And we encourage you to join the team, see if you can raise any money, and then come on out on the 24th to go for this walk to raise money and awareness for the Gateway of Hope.
[354.28 --> 357.32]  Finally, a couple of in-house things.
[357.40 --> 360.08]  Youth, we have HCBC today.
[360.40 --> 361.50]  Again, it's at a weird time.
[361.56 --> 363.32]  We're going to do that right after the service today.
[363.42 --> 368.06]  So from noon until 1, grade 9s to 12s, you're invited to come out for HCBC.
[368.76 --> 371.54]  As always, grade 9s and 10s are going to be doing the Catechism.
[371.66 --> 373.96]  Grade 11s and 12s, you'll be with me doing the Belgian Confession.
[374.06 --> 375.88]  So we'll see you after the service for that.
[376.16 --> 380.16]  I've got a tiny little, like, a Gateway lunch for you.
[380.24 --> 382.26]  So something small, but it'll get you through the hour, I promise.
[382.26 --> 388.44]  And then finally, after the service, we are celebrating with a couple of members of our church today.
[388.54 --> 394.36]  Maybe they can stand up because John and Helen Van Bergeyke celebrated their 50th anniversary this week.
[400.36 --> 403.34]  And there is cake after the service to celebrate that.
[403.44 --> 407.48]  So please stick around, enjoy us for some cake, and congratulate them in person.
[407.48 --> 413.00]  I'd love to invite you all to rise now and receive God's greeting this morning.
[417.68 --> 420.56]  God's greeting this morning comes from Revelation 1.
[420.56 --> 427.48]  Grace and peace to you from him who is and who was and who is to come,
[427.84 --> 430.74]  and from the seven spirits that are before his throne,
[430.84 --> 433.86]  and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness,
[434.36 --> 438.00]  the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth.
[438.70 --> 440.80]  All God's people said, amen.
[441.08 --> 444.74]  As God has greeted us this morning, please take a moment to greet those around you as well.
[444.74 --> 474.04]  As we gather,
[474.04 --> 476.80]  this morning to worship our God.
[477.32 --> 481.22]  We gather as a community of one body in Christ.
[481.72 --> 485.50]  We come from different backgrounds, different life experiences,
[486.28 --> 489.34]  different ages, different current circumstances,
[489.76 --> 493.94]  but we come as one people, holy and dearly loved.
[494.80 --> 499.32]  Let's confess our common belief together with the words of the Apostles' Creed.
[499.32 --> 504.10]  I believe in God, Father Almighty,
[504.78 --> 506.60]  the creator of heaven and earth.
[507.22 --> 511.12]  I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,
[511.64 --> 513.94]  who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
[514.48 --> 516.14]  and born of the Virgin Mary.
[516.78 --> 518.82]  He suffered and haunt his life,
[519.32 --> 521.82]  so crucified, died, and was buried.
[522.38 --> 523.74]  He descended to hell.
[523.74 --> 526.94]  The third day he rose again from the dead.
[527.46 --> 528.90]  He ascended to heaven,
[529.34 --> 532.60]  and he seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.
[533.26 --> 536.62]  From there he will come to judge the living and the dead.
[537.38 --> 539.38]  I believe in the Holy Spirit,
[539.80 --> 541.48]  of the Holy Catholic Church,
[542.02 --> 543.40]  the communion of saints,
[543.96 --> 545.40]  the forgiveness of saints,
[545.96 --> 547.60]  the resurrection of the body,
[548.08 --> 549.50]  and the life everlasting.
[549.50 --> 550.28]  Amen.
[550.28 --> 550.50]  Amen.
[551.18 --> 551.22]  Amen.
[551.22 --> 581.20]  piano plays softly
[581.20 --> 586.54]  The all-creating One
[586.54 --> 589.56]  God Almighty
[589.56 --> 595.20]  Through Your Holy Spirit
[595.84 --> 599.20]  Conceiving Christ the Son
[600.00 --> 603.30]  Jesus our Savior
[603.30 --> 609.32]  I believe in God our Father
[609.32 --> 613.06]  I believe in Christ the Son
[613.06 --> 616.34]  I believe in the Holy Spirit
[616.34 --> 620.12]  Our God is three in one
[620.12 --> 623.16]  I believe in the resurrection
[623.16 --> 626.32]  That we will rise again
[627.02 --> 633.32]  For I believe in the name of Jesus
[633.32 --> 651.06]  Our judge and our defender
[651.06 --> 654.44]  Suffered and crucified
[654.44 --> 660.18]  Forgiveness is in you
[660.18 --> 665.20]  Descended into darkness
[665.20 --> 669.44]  Who rose in glorious light
[669.44 --> 673.18]  Forever standing high
[673.18 --> 678.56]  I believe in God our Father
[678.56 --> 682.04]  I believe in Christ the Son
[682.04 --> 685.42]  I believe in the Holy Spirit
[685.42 --> 689.04]  Our God is three in one
[689.04 --> 692.02]  I believe in the resurrection
[692.02 --> 695.76]  That we will rise again
[695.76 --> 701.90]  For I believe in the name of Jesus
[701.90 --> 709.64]  I believe in you
[709.64 --> 710.64]  I believe in you
[710.64 --> 716.22]  I believe you rose again
[716.22 --> 721.64]  I believe in you
[721.64 --> 727.38]  That Jesus Christ is Lord
[727.38 --> 735.38]  I believe in you
[735.38 --> 739.38]  I believe in you
[739.38 --> 740.38]  I believe in you
[740.38 --> 741.38]  I believe in you
[741.38 --> 743.38]  I believe in you
[743.38 --> 749.12]  I believe in you
[749.12 --> 750.06]  I believe in you
[754.12 --> 760.18]  I believe in you
[760.18 --> 760.52]  God is three in blood
[760.52 --> 760.68]  I believe in you
[760.68 --> 761.74]  I believe in you
[761.74 --> 761.96]  I believe in you
[761.96 --> 769.00]  I believe in Jesus Christ is Lord

[858.44 --> 862.44]  that thou art
[862.44 --> 864.44]  thou might not
[864.44 --> 868.44]  by day or by night

[906.44 --> 910.44]  and i with thee one
[910.44 --> 912.44]  thou

[916.44 --> 918.44]  riches
[918.44 --> 920.44]  i
[920.44 --> 922.44]  not your man's empty praise
[922.44 --> 924.44]  thou
[924.44 --> 926.44]  my
[926.44 --> 928.44]  inheritance
[928.44 --> 930.44]  now and always
[930.44 --> 932.44]  now and
[932.44 --> 934.44]  thou only
[934.44 --> 936.44]  thou
[936.44 --> 938.44]  only
[938.44 --> 940.44]  first
[940.44 --> 942.44]  in my heart
[942.44 --> 944.44]  my
[944.44 --> 946.44]  my
[946.44 --> 948.44]  my
[948.44 --> 950.44]  my
[950.44 --> 952.44]  my
[952.44 --> 954.44]  my
[954.44 --> 956.44]  my
[956.44 --> 962.44]  my
[962.44 --> 976.44]  my
[976.44 --> 978.44]  my
[978.44 --> 982.44]  my

[1024.44 --> 1044.06]  Hear our prayer, Lord. Amen.
[1047.98 --> 1052.92]  Our words of assurance come from 1 Corinthians 2, verses 9 through 12.
[1052.92 --> 1056.10]  However, as it is written,
[1057.32 --> 1068.66]  The things God has prepared for those who love him,
[1069.38 --> 1073.50]  these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit.
[1074.54 --> 1078.94]  The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.
[1078.94 --> 1084.78]  For who knows a person's thoughts except their own spirit within them?
[1085.66 --> 1090.50]  In the same way, no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.
[1091.62 --> 1095.20]  What we have received is not the Spirit of the world,
[1095.78 --> 1098.06]  but the Spirit who is from God,
[1098.56 --> 1103.06]  so that we may understand what God has freely given us.
[1103.06 --> 1106.16]  Please rise and join us in song.
[1106.16 --> 1111.16]  Holy Spirit, reign now,
[1111.16 --> 1123.54]  Holy Spirit, reign now,

[1257.16 --> 1260.16]  what God has in store,
[1260.16 --> 1263.16]  so open up heaven,
[1263.16 --> 1266.16]  open it wide,
[1266.16 --> 1269.16]  over your church,
[1269.16 --> 1273.16]  and over our lives,

[1325.16 --> 1329.16]  cai nå,
[1329.16 --> 1340.16]  let your rose,
[1340.16 --> 1353.16]  join me,
[1353.16 --> 1358.42]  The gift of grace is Jesus my Redeemer.
[1359.44 --> 1365.56]  There is no more for heaven now to give.
[1366.22 --> 1371.90]  He is my joy, my righteousness and freedom,
[1373.02 --> 1379.00]  my steadfast love and deep and boundless peace.
[1379.00 --> 1385.46]  To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus,
[1386.66 --> 1392.84]  for my life is wholly bound to His.
[1393.58 --> 1398.00]  Oh, how strange and divine I can sing,
[1398.62 --> 1405.12]  all is mine, yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[1409.00 --> 1421.92]  The night is dark, but I am not forsaken,
[1422.72 --> 1428.46]  for by my side the Savior He will stay.
[1428.46 --> 1435.78]  I labor on in weakness and rejoicing,
[1436.34 --> 1442.18]  for in my need His power is to slay.
[1442.86 --> 1449.12]  To this I hold, my shepherd will defend me,
[1449.12 --> 1455.12]  through the deepest valley He will lead.
[1456.50 --> 1459.52]  Oh, the night has been won,
[1459.88 --> 1462.42]  and I shall overcome,
[1463.16 --> 1467.94]  yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[1467.94 --> 1484.34]  No fate I dread, I know I am forgiven.
[1485.40 --> 1490.94]  The future's sure, the price it has been paid.
[1490.94 --> 1497.52]  For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon,
[1498.14 --> 1503.72]  and He was raised to overthrow the grave.
[1504.78 --> 1510.32]  To this I hold, my sin has been defeated.
[1510.32 --> 1517.32]  Jesus now and ever, my King.
[1517.32 --> 1521.20]  Oh, the chains are released,
[1521.20 --> 1524.50]  I can sing, I am free,
[1524.88 --> 1529.32]  yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[1529.32 --> 1546.22]  With every breath I long to follow Jesus,
[1547.06 --> 1553.48]  for He has said that He will bring me home,
[1553.48 --> 1559.48]  and day by day I know He will renew me,
[1559.48 --> 1566.48]  until I stand with joy before the throne.
[1566.48 --> 1572.62]  To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus,
[1572.62 --> 1578.92]  all the glory evermore to Him.
[1578.92 --> 1582.92]  When the race is complete,
[1582.92 --> 1584.92]  when the race is complete,
[1584.92 --> 1586.92]  still my lips shall repeat,
[1586.92 --> 1591.92]  yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[1591.92 --> 1597.92]  To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus,
[1597.92 --> 1604.92]  all the glory evermore to Him.
[1604.92 --> 1608.92]  When the race is complete,
[1608.92 --> 1611.92]  still my lips shall repeat,
[1611.92 --> 1617.92]  yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[1617.92 --> 1620.92]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[1621.92 --> 1633.92]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[1633.92 --> 1641.74]  Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[1645.84 --> 1660.20]  Good morning, my name is Mike and I'm a deacon here at the church.
[1660.20 --> 1665.14]  And we have an opportunity now to give of our blessings and worship God in this way.
[1665.54 --> 1668.66]  So today we've designated the offering to Night Shift Ministries.
[1669.30 --> 1674.14]  And Night Shift is a ministry that I think this church has been involved with almost since it started.
[1674.58 --> 1678.64]  They've been serving the less fortunate for over 20 years in Surrey.
[1678.78 --> 1682.16]  And they actually do spend some nights helping out in Langley.
[1682.60 --> 1684.80]  And it is 365 days a year.
[1684.80 --> 1690.94]  There are staff and volunteers and churches connecting with people that have some pretty immediate needs.
[1691.38 --> 1697.74]  They deal with meals, clothing, crisis care, basic nursing, prayer, drop-in services, Bible studies.
[1698.16 --> 1700.42]  A whole gambit of really awesome things.
[1700.68 --> 1703.72]  So thank you for giving of your gifts today.
[1703.72 --> 1733.70]  Thank you.
[1733.70 --> 1735.70]  Thank you.
[1735.70 --> 1736.70]  Thank you.
[1736.70 --> 1737.70]  Thank you.
[1737.70 --> 1740.70]  Thank you.
[1740.70 --> 1741.70]  Thank you.
[1741.70 --> 1745.70]  Thank you.
[1770.70 --> 1773.72]  Your will is what I want.
[1774.12 --> 1776.78]  Jesus, have it all.
[1779.74 --> 1782.98]  Jesus, have it all.
[1783.40 --> 1786.02]  Jesus, have it all.
[1786.34 --> 1789.04]  To you belongs the glory,
[1789.50 --> 1792.00]  the praise of all the world.
[1792.74 --> 1794.78]  Jesus, have it all.
[1795.78 --> 1797.78]  Jesus, have it all.
[1797.78 --> 1800.78]  A blessing and all honor,
[1801.92 --> 1804.70]  a majesty and all.
[1805.12 --> 1807.78]  Jesus, have it all.
[1810.68 --> 1813.90]  Jesus, have your church,
[1814.02 --> 1816.84]  your love, your pride,
[1817.24 --> 1821.22]  the joy for which you freely gave.
[1821.64 --> 1825.90]  Your life, radiant in white,
[1825.90 --> 1829.24]  washed and pure in white.
[1829.66 --> 1831.94]  Jesus, have it all.
[1835.20 --> 1837.90]  Jesus, have your worth,
[1838.56 --> 1841.24]  your due, your sound.
[1841.78 --> 1843.90]  The praise of every nation,
[1845.10 --> 1847.40]  tribe and town.
[1847.40 --> 1850.48]  And all that has been made,
[1850.48 --> 1853.86]  glorify your name.
[1853.86 --> 1857.40]  Jesus, have it all.
[1857.40 --> 1862.40]  Jesus, have it all.
[1862.40 --> 1864.40]  Jesus, have it all.
[1864.40 --> 1866.20]  Jesus, have it all.
[1866.40 --> 1868.40]  To you belongs the glory,
[1869.74 --> 1872.16]  the praise of all the world.
[1872.90 --> 1875.58]  Jesus, have it all.
[1875.82 --> 1878.56]  Jesus, have it all.
[1878.56 --> 1881.56]  All blessing and all honor,
[1881.56 --> 1884.80]  all majesty and all.
[1884.80 --> 1887.80]  Jesus, have it all.
[1887.86 --> 1890.56]  Jesus, have it all.
[1890.56 --> 1893.98]  To you belongs the glory,
[1894.44 --> 1896.86]  the praise of all the world.
[1897.40 --> 1899.56]  Jesus, have it all.
[1900.62 --> 1902.98]  Jesus, have it all.
[1902.98 --> 1906.28]  All blessing and all honor,
[1906.28 --> 1909.52]  all majesty and all.
[1909.52 --> 1913.00]  Jesus, have it all.
[1932.98 --> 1944.42]  All my days, all my life, have it all.
[1944.42 --> 1957.28]  All my days, all my life, have it all.
[1957.28 --> 1969.06]  All my days, all my life, have it all.
[1969.06 --> 1981.56]  All my days, all my life, have it all.
[1987.28 --> 1995.88]  Good morning, if I could invite all the three-year-olds to grade four to the front to join me for just
[1995.88 --> 1999.12]  a little highlight of our lesson today and our children's blessing.
[2002.46 --> 2004.16]  Right, right nice and close.
[2005.34 --> 2006.20]  Hi, everybody.
[2006.86 --> 2007.34]  Hi.
[2007.74 --> 2011.84]  Hey, do you guys ever try to be like somebody else?
[2012.48 --> 2012.92]  No.
[2013.18 --> 2013.36]  No?
[2013.52 --> 2015.14]  We're pretty happy with who we are?
[2015.14 --> 2018.88]  Well, I'm going to try to be like somebody else right now.
[2018.98 --> 2019.78]  Well, kind of.
[2020.10 --> 2024.28]  And you have to try and guess who am I trying to be like.
[2025.02 --> 2026.66]  This is going to be a little bit hard, actually.
[2026.82 --> 2029.04]  But you probably guess what this person is.
[2029.08 --> 2029.70]  So I'm going to start.
[2029.88 --> 2032.68]  I'm starting with, I'm wearing jeans, blue jeans.
[2032.78 --> 2035.12]  This person always wears blue jeans.
[2037.12 --> 2041.02]  And I'm going to put on a bright plaid shirt.
[2041.02 --> 2045.04]  This person always wears a bright plaid shirt.
[2045.14 --> 2045.66]  What did you get?
[2045.98 --> 2047.04]  A farmer.
[2047.48 --> 2048.58]  That's a good clue.
[2049.12 --> 2049.36]  All right.
[2049.42 --> 2056.64]  Well, then let's just finish the farmer attire.
[2057.58 --> 2057.70]  Huh?
[2057.84 --> 2058.94]  Do farmers wear rubber boots?
[2059.36 --> 2059.80]  Yeah.
[2060.20 --> 2063.84]  This person, I always saw them in a plaid shirt and rubber boots.
[2065.34 --> 2066.12]  A farmer.
[2066.12 --> 2066.60]  A farmer.
[2067.00 --> 2069.40]  Who do you think I know that's a farmer?
[2069.76 --> 2069.98]  Who?
[2070.54 --> 2070.80]  Who?
[2071.60 --> 2072.64]  Oh, my gosh.
[2072.76 --> 2072.92]  Yeah.
[2073.08 --> 2077.98]  His favorite toy was a bobcat for most of my life.
[2078.60 --> 2079.28]  Do you have a guess, Gary?
[2080.38 --> 2081.64]  Oh, a construction man.
[2081.74 --> 2083.14]  This guy also worked in construction.
[2083.54 --> 2086.28]  You might not know who this is, but there are clues.
[2086.28 --> 2092.96]  Every morning when I would go to the school bus, there's a clue, when I was a kid, I would
[2092.96 --> 2098.52]  see him standing at the edge of the barn in rubber boots and a plaid shirt and a toque
[2098.52 --> 2101.80]  that he never really put on.
[2102.34 --> 2105.80]  Like, it was always pooping up like this with his little bobble.
[2106.60 --> 2109.76]  And he would wave as we were getting onto the school bus.
[2110.22 --> 2111.54]  Who do you think that would be?
[2112.00 --> 2115.08]  Who would wave at me before getting onto the school bus every morning?
[2115.08 --> 2116.32]  The driver?
[2117.58 --> 2118.12]  Not quite.
[2119.50 --> 2120.66]  You guys don't know this guy.
[2120.76 --> 2121.60]  This is my dad.
[2122.04 --> 2123.48]  My dad is a farmer.
[2123.88 --> 2125.32]  And he was also a construction worker.
[2125.52 --> 2129.74]  And this is pretty much what he wore every day of his life, including a toque just like
[2129.74 --> 2130.02]  this.
[2130.60 --> 2131.30]  Kind of funny.
[2132.30 --> 2134.12]  And his favorite toy was a bobcat.
[2134.86 --> 2141.12]  And I think if some of my other siblings were here, they would know for sure that I was
[2141.12 --> 2142.64]  pretending to be my dad right now.
[2143.06 --> 2143.36]  Yeah?
[2143.36 --> 2143.46]  Yeah?
[2145.08 --> 2145.44]  Yeah.
[2147.68 --> 2148.02]  Totally.
[2148.50 --> 2153.88]  So, today we've been talking about, or in Children's Worship Time, we've been talking
[2153.88 --> 2154.98]  about the book of Matthew.
[2155.16 --> 2161.56]  And today's lesson is now a section in the book of Matthew that gives us instructions
[2161.56 --> 2165.10]  on how to be a little bit more like God.
[2165.10 --> 2167.22]  So, what are the things we would wear?
[2167.30 --> 2172.34]  What are the things we would do that would help people know that we believe in God and
[2172.34 --> 2173.20]  we're pointing to him?
[2173.70 --> 2173.94]  Okay?
[2174.02 --> 2176.18]  So, we're going to talk about that more in Children's Worship Time today.
[2176.38 --> 2180.82]  And I want to hear a little bit more from you guys who you maybe try to be like sometimes.
[2181.14 --> 2181.34]  Yeah?
[2181.34 --> 2187.38]  Okay, let's stand with the congregation and we will do our children's blessing.
[2188.90 --> 2190.22]  We'll lift our hands.
[2192.02 --> 2193.42]  And together say,
[2193.92 --> 2195.68]  The Lord be with you.
[2196.02 --> 2197.20]  And also with you.
[2197.20 --> 2198.72]  All right, we'll see you in worship time.
[2198.72 --> 2200.96]  Thank you.
[2200.96 --> 2225.30]  Good morning.
[2225.30 --> 2225.38]  Good morning.
[2225.66 --> 2230.14]  My name is Haley and I will be leading us in our church family prayer this morning.
[2230.96 --> 2233.40]  Please join me in prayer.
[2235.32 --> 2240.24]  Dear Heavenly Father, we gather before you in this morning hour as your people and we
[2240.24 --> 2242.46]  praise you for the many blessings you have given us.
[2242.98 --> 2246.70]  We are so blessed to live where we do, surrounded by the beauty of your creation.
[2247.54 --> 2251.30]  Thank you for the rain and the wind and the glorious sunshine when it's here.
[2251.58 --> 2255.32]  Thank you for our families and friends, for we babies and grandparents.
[2256.08 --> 2258.38]  Thank you for the gift of your son, our Savior.
[2258.38 --> 2265.58]  In these dark and dreary February days, help us to remember the good news of great joy that is for all people.
[2267.02 --> 2273.86]  Forgive us for forgetting when the world around us fills our minds and hearts with worry, despair, and ourselves.
[2274.76 --> 2278.00]  Thank you that your love never changes and never fades.
[2278.00 --> 2285.98]  Thank you for coming to save us from our sinful condition and for giving us eternal life and the joy of a personal relationship with you, our Lord.
[2286.64 --> 2291.10]  Thank you for the promise of your birth and the power of your death and resurrection.
[2291.10 --> 2298.70]  We praise you and thank you that John and Helen celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary this week.
[2299.44 --> 2302.88]  We pray that you will bless them in their 51st year of marriage.
[2303.60 --> 2307.86]  We thank you alongside the Fulkerts and Kunst families for the birth of baby Jake.
[2308.44 --> 2309.90]  Please bless him and keep him.
[2309.90 --> 2313.50]  Lord, we pray for all those who are grieving.
[2313.98 --> 2315.68]  Comfort them and be near to them.
[2316.36 --> 2320.14]  We pray for those who struggle with their mental health and other invisible illnesses.
[2321.02 --> 2325.54]  Remind us as a church to surround them and comfort them, for we are your hands and feet.
[2326.98 --> 2327.98]  The Lord reigns.
[2328.30 --> 2329.48]  He is roped in majesty.
[2330.10 --> 2332.98]  The Lord is roped in majesty and armed with strength.
[2333.60 --> 2337.34]  Indeed, the world is established, firm, and secure.
[2337.34 --> 2339.70]  Your throne was established long ago.
[2340.30 --> 2341.68]  You are from all eternity.
[2342.40 --> 2343.74]  In Jesus' name we pray.
[2344.12 --> 2344.40]  Amen.
[2361.48 --> 2365.74]  Growing up, I was actually a fairly little child.
[2365.74 --> 2371.36]  For years, actually, people thought that me and my brother, who was two years younger than I, were twins.
[2371.82 --> 2375.86]  Mostly because I was fairly small and my brother was a little bit of a chunkster when he was young.
[2376.58 --> 2380.98]  There should be a picture actually coming up on the screen behind me and I'll have you guess which one I was.
[2382.40 --> 2383.24]  See, it's hard to tell.
[2384.28 --> 2386.20]  Anyways, I was the runt in school.
[2386.44 --> 2393.68]  But all of that changed in a glorious summer between grade five and grade six where I just shot up like a rocket.
[2393.68 --> 2397.10]  Instantly, I was one of the tallest people in my grade.
[2397.66 --> 2405.74]  I was the starting center of our school's basketball team and rebounding the basketball became what I thought God's calling for my life was.
[2406.18 --> 2411.84]  I considered myself a blander, blonder, maybe more civil Dennis Rodman.
[2411.84 --> 2422.14]  But I remember one day, back then, after that summer, just towering over my little brother, looking down on him and just saying,
[2422.76 --> 2424.44]  Remember how people thought we were twins?
[2424.80 --> 2426.56]  You will never be taller than me.
[2426.56 --> 2432.74]  The Lord taught me a lot of humility over those next few years because I have never grown taller than that moment.
[2432.94 --> 2440.06]  And my brother, who again is two years younger than me, in the next five years, actually about five years after I considered him obsolete,
[2440.40 --> 2442.48]  he grew to a whopping six foot seven.
[2442.48 --> 2453.00]  And so now, when we play basketball together, between his height advantage and the fact that I've got the vertical of a walrus,
[2453.10 --> 2456.20]  there's just no competition anymore when we play ball.
[2457.70 --> 2463.36]  Now, I tell you that little bit of family history because today we're going to be looking at humility.
[2463.36 --> 2473.24]  We're going to see that humility is something that becomes a piece of who we are once we are transformed by the renewing of our minds in Jesus Christ.
[2473.34 --> 2479.98]  And while that rarely has anything to do with how tall you are, it does have to do with the gifts that God has given us.
[2480.82 --> 2484.78]  So if you're joining us today for the first time, we've been working our way through Romans.
[2485.02 --> 2489.64]  And today we find ourselves at Romans chapter 12, verses 3 to 8.
[2489.64 --> 2492.52]  So if you have your Bibles with you, I encourage you, please open those up.
[2492.52 --> 2494.84]  You can grab one from the back if you wish.
[2495.58 --> 2499.08]  And at the beginning here, the words will be on this screen.
[2499.16 --> 2501.00]  But I do encourage you, keep those Bibles open.
[2501.08 --> 2506.14]  Or if you have the Bible on your phone, you can open up your app and keep those beside you
[2506.14 --> 2509.10]  because we will be going back to this text throughout this message.
[2509.50 --> 2514.20]  So please follow along here as we read Romans 12, verses 3 to 8.
[2515.80 --> 2519.80]  For by the grace given to me, I say to every one of you,
[2519.80 --> 2526.62]  Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment,
[2527.06 --> 2530.00]  in according with the faith God has distributed to each of you.
[2530.48 --> 2536.22]  For just as each of you has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function,
[2536.22 --> 2543.36]  so in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others.
[2543.96 --> 2547.78]  We have different gifts according to the grace given to each of us.
[2547.98 --> 2552.02]  If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your faith.
[2552.20 --> 2554.06]  If it is serving, then serve.
[2554.32 --> 2556.16]  If it is teaching, then teach.
[2556.66 --> 2559.22]  If it is to encourage, then...
[2559.22 --> 2560.74]  I've lost my spot there.
[2560.74 --> 2563.18]  If it is to encourage, then give encouragement.
[2563.44 --> 2565.50]  If it is giving, then give generously.
[2565.88 --> 2568.08]  If it is to lead, do it diligently.
[2569.18 --> 2572.38]  If it is to show mercy, do it cheerfully.
[2573.32 --> 2574.46]  The word of the Lord.
[2577.04 --> 2582.48]  Now last week, Pastor Chris led us through the first two verses in Romans 12,
[2582.48 --> 2587.34]  which is likely the biggest transitionary verse in this entire letter.
[2587.34 --> 2591.40]  The whole letter up until that point, Romans 1 to Romans 11,
[2591.84 --> 2595.86]  was about how due to human sin, the only way to be justified,
[2596.20 --> 2597.70]  or the only way to be saved,
[2598.30 --> 2601.44]  is by grace alone, through faith alone,
[2601.74 --> 2603.96]  because of Christ alone.
[2604.98 --> 2606.70]  Then Romans 12 starts,
[2606.78 --> 2609.54]  and last week we learned that once we understand that truth,
[2609.82 --> 2613.42]  once we understand the magnitude of that reality,
[2613.42 --> 2616.84]  once we really grasp how God's grace and mercy
[2616.84 --> 2619.42]  sets into our lives and our minds,
[2619.78 --> 2622.42]  the only thing that makes sense
[2622.42 --> 2624.68]  is to give it all to God.
[2625.38 --> 2626.48]  All of ourselves.
[2626.86 --> 2629.42]  Our lives, our joys, our griefs,
[2630.16 --> 2631.50]  our doubts, our everything.
[2632.48 --> 2635.48]  That is our new spiritual reality.
[2635.60 --> 2638.18]  That's what the renewing of our minds looks like.
[2639.22 --> 2642.56]  Today, this text continues down that same vein.
[2643.30 --> 2647.44]  Our text today is very much connected to our text from last week.
[2647.54 --> 2650.60]  And we know this because our text today starts with the word for.
[2651.12 --> 2653.16]  For, which means that everything afterwards,
[2653.32 --> 2654.46]  everything after the word for,
[2654.54 --> 2656.02]  is connected to the words before it.
[2657.12 --> 2657.38]  All right?
[2657.44 --> 2658.46]  So in light of that,
[2658.84 --> 2661.42]  the big idea, which is connected to last week, is this.
[2661.84 --> 2663.94]  By giving everything we have to God,
[2664.12 --> 2664.90]  two things happen.
[2665.64 --> 2667.26]  First, we humble ourselves.
[2667.26 --> 2670.82]  And then second, in that humility,
[2671.20 --> 2673.02]  we give of ourselves to the church.
[2673.98 --> 2675.62]  So we humble ourselves,
[2675.82 --> 2677.96]  and we give ourselves to the church.
[2679.14 --> 2682.40]  Last week was our new spiritual reality.
[2682.92 --> 2685.02]  This week, we look at the practical reality
[2685.02 --> 2686.08]  that comes out of that,
[2686.14 --> 2688.78]  that is birthed out of our new spiritual reality.
[2688.90 --> 2691.00]  And so we're going to take a look at why that is.
[2691.00 --> 2693.84]  So knowing where we have come from,
[2694.14 --> 2695.68]  that because of God's grace and mercy,
[2695.80 --> 2697.20]  we're to give everything over to God,
[2697.28 --> 2698.70]  our text tells us
[2698.70 --> 2703.16]  what our natural or practical outcome for our lives is,
[2703.26 --> 2705.28]  what our reaction will be.
[2706.18 --> 2707.72]  Now, please hear that.
[2708.52 --> 2711.90]  Because today's text is not like an optional thing.
[2711.98 --> 2713.34]  It's not an optional outcome.
[2713.44 --> 2714.48]  It's not saying that,
[2714.78 --> 2715.88]  hey, your mind is renewed,
[2715.88 --> 2717.86]  so now maybe try these things.
[2718.84 --> 2720.00]  That's not what it's saying.
[2720.48 --> 2723.06]  The consequence or the ramifications,
[2723.42 --> 2724.76]  or really to speak positively,
[2724.84 --> 2726.34]  because this is a positive outcome,
[2726.74 --> 2730.40]  the natural work of the Holy Spirit in our lives,
[2730.42 --> 2731.46]  once we've done that,
[2732.10 --> 2734.36]  is humility and service.
[2736.50 --> 2737.50]  Well, take a look at this.
[2739.22 --> 2741.76]  Humility is the default response
[2741.76 --> 2742.90]  to an understanding
[2742.90 --> 2746.08]  that the only thing that we contribute
[2746.08 --> 2747.24]  to our salvation
[2747.24 --> 2750.38]  is the sin that we need saving from.
[2752.12 --> 2754.92]  Humility becomes the default response
[2754.92 --> 2756.38]  to an understanding
[2756.38 --> 2761.28]  that once grace and faith
[2761.28 --> 2764.12]  have entered the narrative of our lives,
[2764.42 --> 2766.54]  the only thing we can do
[2766.54 --> 2768.78]  is be grateful and be humble.
[2771.32 --> 2772.48]  Verse 3 says that.
[2772.48 --> 2774.38]  Now, it may not be as obvious in English
[2774.38 --> 2775.98]  as it is in Greek in verse 3.
[2776.30 --> 2777.36]  Paul actually starts using
[2777.36 --> 2779.28]  very poetic language here in the Greek.
[2779.76 --> 2781.60]  And without wanting to Greek out too much,
[2782.02 --> 2783.36]  Paul interchanges two words.
[2783.46 --> 2786.24]  He interchanges the word phronio,
[2786.84 --> 2788.72]  which means to reason or to think,
[2789.04 --> 2790.82]  with the word huberphronio,
[2790.92 --> 2792.78]  which means to be proud or to be arrogant.
[2793.16 --> 2794.68]  And I say this just for one reason.
[2795.12 --> 2796.72]  When authors of letters like this
[2796.72 --> 2798.64]  start using poetry and wordplay
[2798.64 --> 2799.40]  and stuff like that,
[2799.40 --> 2801.10]  it's because they're honing in on a point.
[2801.10 --> 2803.48]  They're trying to emphasize something.
[2804.50 --> 2805.88]  And Paul here is saying,
[2806.38 --> 2807.44]  don't be proud and arrogant.
[2807.60 --> 2808.96]  That's not who you are anymore.
[2810.00 --> 2810.92]  Because of the faith
[2810.92 --> 2812.54]  that God has distributed to you,
[2812.90 --> 2814.46]  don't think too highly of yourself.
[2814.84 --> 2816.22]  Acknowledge that it's all God.
[2816.60 --> 2818.24]  Give yourself over to him.
[2818.70 --> 2820.68]  Humility follows faith.
[2822.86 --> 2824.84]  Now, remember, humility is not,
[2824.90 --> 2825.90]  being humble humility,
[2825.90 --> 2828.00]  it's not the same as self-loathing
[2828.00 --> 2830.00]  or self-deprivation.
[2830.12 --> 2831.98]  That's far too deep a dive,
[2832.04 --> 2832.74]  far too negative.
[2833.26 --> 2836.10]  But humility is self-awareness.
[2837.30 --> 2839.20]  Self-awareness to the fact
[2839.20 --> 2841.32]  that God created you.
[2841.86 --> 2843.36]  So anything you accomplish
[2843.36 --> 2845.16]  is because of God and God alone.
[2846.70 --> 2848.02]  It's self-awareness to the fact
[2848.02 --> 2849.94]  that Jesus saved you.
[2850.48 --> 2852.98]  And so anything you hope to do going forward
[2852.98 --> 2854.20]  is only possible
[2854.20 --> 2857.18]  because Jesus intervened in your life.
[2858.52 --> 2859.86]  Self-awareness to the fact
[2859.86 --> 2861.16]  that the triune God
[2861.16 --> 2863.36]  loves you so much,
[2863.62 --> 2864.36]  no matter what.
[2864.44 --> 2865.60]  So even if pride
[2865.60 --> 2867.24]  isn't an issue in your life,
[2867.30 --> 2869.10]  but maybe the other end of the spectrum is,
[2869.30 --> 2870.54]  maybe low self-worth
[2870.54 --> 2871.92]  or low self-esteem is,
[2872.94 --> 2874.50]  God is with you
[2874.50 --> 2875.54]  and he loves you more
[2875.54 --> 2876.50]  than you will ever know.
[2876.50 --> 2879.48]  That's the humility,
[2879.62 --> 2880.46]  the self-awareness
[2880.46 --> 2881.84]  that he is calling us to today.
[2882.04 --> 2883.74]  We live out this humility
[2883.74 --> 2885.50]  by accepting the fact
[2885.50 --> 2887.34]  that we are to be made less
[2887.34 --> 2888.94]  and Christ is to be made more.
[2891.00 --> 2892.58]  And so, as verse 3 says,
[2892.68 --> 2894.02]  we are to think of ourselves
[2894.02 --> 2895.36]  with sober judgment
[2895.36 --> 2898.36]  in accordance with the faith
[2898.36 --> 2899.90]  that God has distributed
[2899.90 --> 2900.72]  to each of you.
[2902.24 --> 2903.54]  Notice the barometer
[2903.54 --> 2905.74]  that we use to check our humility
[2905.74 --> 2906.62]  is the faith
[2906.62 --> 2908.92]  that God has distributed to you.
[2908.96 --> 2909.64]  Now, this is important
[2909.64 --> 2910.32]  for two reasons.
[2911.88 --> 2912.96]  The first is,
[2913.06 --> 2913.58]  oftentimes,
[2914.10 --> 2914.80]  when we are trying
[2914.80 --> 2916.14]  to check our self-worth,
[2916.62 --> 2917.74]  we compare ourselves
[2917.74 --> 2918.98]  not to the faith
[2918.98 --> 2920.56]  that's been distributed to us,
[2920.94 --> 2922.28]  but we compare ourselves
[2922.28 --> 2923.04]  to the community
[2923.04 --> 2924.46]  that we find ourselves in.
[2925.98 --> 2927.46]  Now, this is extremely,
[2927.64 --> 2928.52]  extremely prevalent
[2928.52 --> 2929.54]  in our world, isn't it?
[2930.22 --> 2932.24]  We are always measuring ourselves
[2932.24 --> 2933.32]  against other people.
[2933.42 --> 2934.52]  We compare ourselves
[2934.52 --> 2935.46]  to one another
[2935.46 --> 2936.94]  in schools for decades.
[2937.48 --> 2938.28]  If you want to climb
[2938.28 --> 2939.06]  the social ladder,
[2939.34 --> 2939.84]  you make sure
[2939.84 --> 2940.72]  to do shoulder checks.
[2940.80 --> 2941.64]  You place yourselves
[2941.64 --> 2942.64]  in the right friend groups,
[2942.92 --> 2943.72]  you put yourselves
[2943.72 --> 2945.02]  doing the right activities,
[2945.40 --> 2946.68]  signing up for the right clubs,
[2946.76 --> 2947.84]  only attending things
[2947.84 --> 2949.70]  if certain people are there.
[2950.42 --> 2952.30]  Whether this is a conscious thing
[2952.30 --> 2953.70]  or a subconscious thing,
[2953.94 --> 2954.76]  we believe that
[2954.76 --> 2955.96]  our social standing
[2955.96 --> 2957.70]  depends on constant
[2957.70 --> 2958.36]  shoulder checking
[2958.36 --> 2959.24]  on who's around me
[2959.24 --> 2960.36]  and who am I fitting in with.
[2960.36 --> 2963.40]  Now, this concept,
[2963.58 --> 2964.22]  which has been true
[2964.22 --> 2964.92]  in real life
[2964.92 --> 2965.70]  for a long time,
[2965.78 --> 2967.08]  has only been magnified
[2967.08 --> 2968.22]  recently online.
[2969.68 --> 2971.24]  While real life comparisons
[2971.24 --> 2972.42]  are still everywhere,
[2972.96 --> 2973.84]  they have become
[2973.84 --> 2975.88]  just ringing gongs
[2975.88 --> 2976.90]  right now
[2976.90 --> 2978.76]  because of social media platforms.
[2979.62 --> 2981.34]  Now, social media platforms,
[2981.46 --> 2982.28]  they've predominantly
[2982.28 --> 2983.48]  become one of two things.
[2984.02 --> 2986.04]  First, they're just a cesspool
[2986.04 --> 2987.16]  of false headlines
[2987.16 --> 2988.36]  and biased information,
[2988.50 --> 2989.06]  so be careful
[2989.06 --> 2989.90]  what you read out there,
[2989.96 --> 2990.52]  but that's a sermon
[2990.52 --> 2991.08]  for another day.
[2991.62 --> 2992.26]  Number two,
[2994.28 --> 2995.26]  social media platforms
[2995.26 --> 2996.18]  have become a place
[2996.18 --> 2997.84]  where everyone's life
[2997.84 --> 2999.02]  becomes so easily
[2999.02 --> 3000.02]  compared with yours.
[3002.42 --> 3003.62]  I don't think this news
[3003.62 --> 3004.40]  is necessarily
[3004.40 --> 3006.16]  that surprising to us today.
[3006.50 --> 3007.06]  Many of us
[3007.06 --> 3008.12]  have heard this before.
[3008.40 --> 3008.98]  Many of us maybe
[3008.98 --> 3009.96]  even understand this
[3009.96 --> 3010.60]  to some degree,
[3011.00 --> 3011.88]  but the fact that
[3011.88 --> 3013.28]  we compare our lives
[3013.28 --> 3014.28]  to illusions
[3014.28 --> 3015.70]  that we see online
[3015.70 --> 3016.72]  is information
[3016.72 --> 3017.24]  that honestly
[3017.24 --> 3017.96]  goes in one ear
[3017.96 --> 3018.74]  and comes out the other,
[3019.74 --> 3020.26]  and that happens
[3020.26 --> 3021.30]  far too often.
[3022.44 --> 3024.72]  We need to stop
[3024.72 --> 3026.14]  comparing ourselves
[3026.14 --> 3026.78]  to each other.
[3026.88 --> 3027.76]  We need to.
[3029.24 --> 3030.90]  Voices with far more influence
[3030.90 --> 3031.36]  than mine
[3031.36 --> 3032.38]  are saying the same thing.
[3032.96 --> 3034.24]  Speaking about posting
[3034.24 --> 3035.94]  to social media platforms,
[3036.52 --> 3037.92]  musical artist
[3037.92 --> 3039.56]  Hosier says this.
[3039.62 --> 3039.90]  He says,
[3039.90 --> 3040.66]  social media
[3040.66 --> 3042.12]  is an advertisement
[3042.12 --> 3043.28]  for the superficial
[3043.28 --> 3044.56]  extroverted self.
[3045.78 --> 3046.54]  Germany Kent,
[3046.72 --> 3047.66]  she's a journalist,
[3047.80 --> 3048.54]  a philanthropist,
[3048.54 --> 3049.72]  and she wrote a book
[3049.72 --> 3050.78]  in 2015 called
[3050.78 --> 3051.70]  You Are What You Tweet.
[3051.80 --> 3052.42]  She says this,
[3052.74 --> 3054.00]  there is a valid reason
[3054.00 --> 3055.30]  social media is linked
[3055.30 --> 3056.34]  to depression and loneliness.
[3056.88 --> 3057.72]  We live in a time
[3057.72 --> 3058.48]  where many people
[3058.48 --> 3059.90]  spend countless hours
[3059.90 --> 3060.98]  a day online
[3060.98 --> 3062.32]  strolling through
[3062.32 --> 3063.44]  the timeline of others
[3063.44 --> 3064.94]  with envy, regret,
[3065.10 --> 3066.50]  and little appreciation
[3066.50 --> 3067.36]  for their own life.
[3068.50 --> 3069.30]  And finally,
[3069.40 --> 3070.20]  perhaps the most quoted
[3070.20 --> 3071.06]  individual of all
[3071.06 --> 3071.50]  of history
[3071.50 --> 3072.40]  who goes by the name
[3072.40 --> 3072.86]  anonymous
[3072.86 --> 3075.22]  has this to say.
[3075.78 --> 3076.36]  Social media
[3076.36 --> 3077.04]  has created
[3077.04 --> 3078.06]  jealous behavior
[3078.06 --> 3079.36]  over illusions.
[3080.32 --> 3080.62]  Sadly,
[3080.76 --> 3081.44]  some are envious
[3081.44 --> 3082.12]  of things,
[3082.54 --> 3083.02]  relationships,
[3083.38 --> 3084.32]  and lifestyles
[3084.32 --> 3085.82]  that don't even exist.
[3087.56 --> 3088.34]  I don't need to
[3088.34 --> 3089.68]  berate this point anymore,
[3089.80 --> 3090.72]  but so many of us
[3090.72 --> 3091.86]  compare our self-worth
[3091.86 --> 3093.70]  to the social media universe
[3093.70 --> 3094.80]  or to the community
[3094.80 --> 3095.58]  in which we live,
[3095.74 --> 3096.72]  and it just doesn't
[3096.72 --> 3097.32]  make sense.
[3098.16 --> 3099.36]  What's posted online
[3099.36 --> 3100.00]  isn't real,
[3100.00 --> 3100.74]  it's a highlight,
[3100.86 --> 3101.60]  and yet we compare
[3101.60 --> 3102.90]  ourselves and our lives
[3102.90 --> 3103.74]  and what we have
[3103.74 --> 3104.90]  to that all the time.
[3105.18 --> 3106.56]  We compare ourselves
[3106.56 --> 3108.42]  to the best snapshots
[3108.42 --> 3109.88]  people have to offer
[3109.88 --> 3112.30]  all the time.
[3112.76 --> 3114.22]  And when we compare
[3114.22 --> 3116.00]  ourselves to other people,
[3116.54 --> 3117.44]  whether it's for
[3117.44 --> 3118.42]  personal reasons
[3118.42 --> 3119.66]  or social reasons
[3119.66 --> 3121.10]  or even corporate reasons,
[3122.00 --> 3123.18]  only one of two things
[3123.18 --> 3123.58]  happens.
[3125.12 --> 3126.84]  We either see ourselves
[3126.84 --> 3128.40]  as better than the other,
[3128.40 --> 3129.80]  which fills up
[3129.80 --> 3130.86]  our prideful hearts,
[3131.12 --> 3133.16]  or we see ourselves
[3133.16 --> 3134.30]  as worse than the other,
[3134.56 --> 3136.70]  which fuels our anxiety
[3136.70 --> 3137.42]  and our depression
[3137.42 --> 3138.06]  even more.
[3139.70 --> 3140.82]  When we compare
[3140.82 --> 3141.78]  ourselves to others,
[3141.86 --> 3143.02]  we increase our pride
[3143.02 --> 3143.60]  and arrogance
[3143.60 --> 3144.70]  or we increase
[3144.70 --> 3145.38]  our anxiety
[3145.38 --> 3145.98]  and depression,
[3146.12 --> 3148.64]  and yet the data
[3148.64 --> 3149.36]  is showing that
[3149.36 --> 3150.44]  we get high
[3150.44 --> 3152.68]  on comparing ourselves
[3152.68 --> 3153.30]  to each other,
[3154.02 --> 3155.52]  and we stop thinking
[3155.52 --> 3156.06]  of ourselves
[3156.06 --> 3157.36]  with sober judgment.
[3158.40 --> 3161.78]  But Paul here says
[3161.78 --> 3162.52]  there's a better way.
[3163.92 --> 3164.80]  Renewed minds
[3164.80 --> 3165.62]  call us to measure
[3165.62 --> 3166.56]  ourselves not against
[3166.56 --> 3167.06]  others,
[3168.02 --> 3169.64]  but with sober judgment
[3169.64 --> 3170.88]  in accordance
[3170.88 --> 3172.12]  with the faith
[3172.12 --> 3173.22]  God has given us.
[3174.58 --> 3175.60]  So what is this faith?
[3175.76 --> 3177.08]  This faith that we're
[3177.08 --> 3178.32]  to measure ourselves with?
[3178.48 --> 3179.36]  Is this faith
[3179.36 --> 3180.42]  a tangible thing?
[3180.64 --> 3182.50]  Or is this a feeling
[3182.50 --> 3183.10]  of something
[3183.10 --> 3183.72]  that we're supposed
[3183.72 --> 3184.28]  to have?
[3185.62 --> 3186.36]  When I looked into
[3186.36 --> 3187.56]  this question this week,
[3187.56 --> 3188.88]  some commentaries
[3188.88 --> 3189.62]  I read said that
[3189.62 --> 3190.54]  this faith is
[3190.54 --> 3191.62]  sound doctrine.
[3192.28 --> 3193.08]  That when we want
[3193.08 --> 3193.98]  to measure ourselves
[3193.98 --> 3194.74]  in accordance with
[3194.74 --> 3195.58]  the faith that we've
[3195.58 --> 3196.04]  been given,
[3196.26 --> 3197.18]  we can open up
[3197.18 --> 3197.52]  scripture,
[3197.88 --> 3198.54]  and we can hold
[3198.54 --> 3199.56]  ourselves to scripture
[3199.56 --> 3200.84]  on what the word
[3200.84 --> 3201.24]  says.
[3202.32 --> 3203.40]  Now other commentaries
[3203.40 --> 3204.18]  said that this faith
[3204.18 --> 3205.48]  that has been given
[3205.48 --> 3207.04]  to us is a feeling
[3207.04 --> 3207.94]  of certainty.
[3208.14 --> 3208.98]  It's an assurance.
[3209.48 --> 3210.18]  It's something that
[3210.18 --> 3211.44]  we can be humbly
[3211.44 --> 3212.30]  certain for.
[3212.38 --> 3213.10]  We can be humbly
[3213.10 --> 3214.70]  certain of who we are
[3214.70 --> 3215.82]  because of the gifts
[3215.82 --> 3216.52]  that God has given
[3216.52 --> 3216.82]  us.
[3218.26 --> 3219.52]  And I think when I
[3219.52 --> 3220.36]  hold up those two
[3220.36 --> 3222.00]  options, the answer
[3222.00 --> 3222.60]  is yes.
[3224.38 --> 3225.56]  Lord's Day 7 of the
[3225.56 --> 3226.50]  Heidelberg Catechism,
[3226.60 --> 3227.38]  which is, it's a
[3227.38 --> 3228.34]  question and answer
[3228.34 --> 3229.60]  that works through
[3229.60 --> 3231.06]  scripture and answers
[3231.06 --> 3231.54]  a lot of these
[3231.54 --> 3232.32]  questions for us.
[3232.38 --> 3233.24]  It dives into this.
[3233.58 --> 3234.30]  Lord's Day 7,
[3234.38 --> 3234.88]  question and answer
[3234.88 --> 3235.72]  20 says this.
[3236.14 --> 3237.18]  What is true faith?
[3237.84 --> 3238.92]  True faith is not
[3238.92 --> 3240.34]  only a sure knowledge
[3240.34 --> 3241.60]  by which I hold as
[3241.60 --> 3243.38]  true, that all God
[3243.38 --> 3244.64]  has revealed to us
[3244.64 --> 3245.28]  in scripture.
[3246.24 --> 3247.42]  It is also a
[3247.42 --> 3248.30]  wholehearted trust
[3248.30 --> 3249.56]  which the Holy Spirit
[3249.56 --> 3250.70]  creates in me by the
[3250.70 --> 3252.08]  gospel that God has
[3252.08 --> 3253.10]  freely granted, not
[3253.10 --> 3254.16]  only to others, but
[3254.16 --> 3255.76]  to me also, forgiveness
[3255.76 --> 3256.82]  of sins, eternal
[3256.82 --> 3257.68]  righteousness, and
[3257.68 --> 3258.10]  salvation.
[3259.68 --> 3261.10]  Faith is both a sure
[3261.10 --> 3261.96]  knowledge that God
[3261.96 --> 3262.82]  has revealed himself
[3262.82 --> 3263.64]  as truth in
[3263.64 --> 3265.60]  scriptures and a
[3265.60 --> 3267.24]  wholehearted trust, a
[3267.24 --> 3268.36]  deep-rooted assurance
[3268.36 --> 3269.50]  that we are loved,
[3269.88 --> 3270.80]  saved, and sent out
[3270.80 --> 3271.22]  by God.
[3273.38 --> 3274.80]  So as we stop
[3274.80 --> 3275.96]  conforming to the
[3275.96 --> 3276.82]  patterns of this
[3276.82 --> 3278.02]  world, and as we
[3278.02 --> 3279.14]  now live out our
[3279.14 --> 3280.08]  lives with renewed
[3280.08 --> 3282.72]  minds, we humble
[3282.72 --> 3284.90]  ourselves because we
[3284.90 --> 3285.44]  have been given
[3285.44 --> 3285.92]  faith.
[3286.76 --> 3288.26]  Faith that God has
[3288.26 --> 3289.06]  given a sound
[3289.06 --> 3290.20]  doctrine in his word
[3290.20 --> 3290.98]  in which we can learn
[3290.98 --> 3292.10]  about him and his
[3292.10 --> 3293.34]  salvation work in us.
[3294.04 --> 3294.82]  Faith that grants us
[3294.82 --> 3296.10]  a deep-rooted assurance
[3296.10 --> 3297.10]  that we are saved
[3297.10 --> 3298.18]  because of him, and
[3298.18 --> 3300.04]  faith that he is who
[3300.04 --> 3302.14]  he says he is, so we
[3302.14 --> 3303.44]  are who he says we
[3303.44 --> 3303.82]  are.
[3306.26 --> 3307.26]  Which then leads us
[3307.26 --> 3308.14]  to the next question,
[3308.26 --> 3308.80]  who are we?
[3310.12 --> 3311.16]  What does that look
[3311.16 --> 3311.48]  like?
[3313.70 --> 3314.84]  Well, if verse 3 was
[3314.84 --> 3316.16]  about humility in our
[3316.16 --> 3317.04]  lives and the working
[3317.04 --> 3317.98]  of that out, then
[3317.98 --> 3319.38]  verses 4 through 8 of
[3319.38 --> 3320.48]  our text talk about
[3320.48 --> 3321.70]  how we are to live
[3321.70 --> 3322.90]  out that humble faith
[3322.90 --> 3323.84]  in the world around
[3323.84 --> 3324.24]  us.
[3324.68 --> 3326.84]  In our humility, we
[3326.84 --> 3327.86]  are to use the gifts
[3327.86 --> 3329.52]  God has given us to
[3329.52 --> 3331.42]  serve and bless the
[3331.42 --> 3331.76]  church.
[3332.36 --> 3333.14]  And that is the next
[3333.14 --> 3333.92]  course of action.
[3334.02 --> 3335.22]  And again, like I said
[3335.22 --> 3336.12]  off the top, this isn't
[3336.12 --> 3337.30]  like an option thing.
[3337.92 --> 3340.04]  This isn't me or Paul
[3340.04 --> 3340.96]  encouraging us, being
[3340.96 --> 3342.22]  like, hey, try that
[3342.22 --> 3342.44]  out.
[3342.58 --> 3343.24]  That's what that would
[3343.24 --> 3343.48]  lead to.
[3343.58 --> 3344.92]  Paul is saying, if we
[3344.92 --> 3345.96]  submit to God, if we
[3345.96 --> 3347.06]  give God our everything,
[3347.46 --> 3348.90]  if we stop conforming to
[3348.90 --> 3350.22]  the world around us, we
[3350.22 --> 3351.94]  gain a renewed mind
[3351.94 --> 3352.98]  where we give our
[3352.98 --> 3354.06]  everything to God.
[3354.24 --> 3357.14]  And as we do that, we
[3357.14 --> 3357.96]  become humble.
[3357.96 --> 3359.98]  And we start serving
[3359.98 --> 3360.64]  the body.
[3360.76 --> 3361.92]  We start serving the
[3361.92 --> 3363.04]  church with the gifts
[3363.04 --> 3364.08]  that we have, not out
[3364.08 --> 3366.64]  of duty, but because
[3366.64 --> 3367.78]  that's all we can do.
[3370.84 --> 3373.78]  Now, of course, the only
[3373.78 --> 3375.62]  way to give of ourselves
[3375.62 --> 3378.06]  to the church is to be a
[3378.06 --> 3379.00]  part of the church.
[3380.00 --> 3381.38]  You cannot give yourself
[3381.38 --> 3382.34]  to the church if you are
[3382.34 --> 3383.90]  not a part of the body of
[3383.90 --> 3385.00]  believers that is the
[3385.00 --> 3385.28]  church.
[3385.28 --> 3385.32]  church.
[3385.76 --> 3386.66]  And while many of you
[3386.66 --> 3387.56]  sitting here right now
[3387.56 --> 3388.50]  are probably thinking,
[3389.00 --> 3389.86]  yeah, I'm here today.
[3389.96 --> 3390.22]  Check.
[3390.44 --> 3391.06]  Like, we're good.
[3391.38 --> 3392.94]  I cannot help but believe
[3392.94 --> 3394.16]  that there is someone
[3394.16 --> 3395.16]  out there right now who
[3395.16 --> 3396.04]  needs to hear this.
[3396.36 --> 3397.30]  Perhaps in this room,
[3397.40 --> 3398.78]  perhaps online right now.
[3399.42 --> 3401.46]  And I know sure well that
[3401.46 --> 3402.40]  there are people in all
[3402.40 --> 3403.78]  of our lives that we
[3403.78 --> 3404.74]  know need to hear this.
[3404.92 --> 3406.12]  So let's listen to Paul's
[3406.12 --> 3407.30]  inspired words here.
[3408.54 --> 3410.24]  Our passage in Romans 12
[3410.24 --> 3411.74]  here lists a bunch of
[3411.74 --> 3412.04]  gifts.
[3412.54 --> 3413.50]  Seven to be exact.
[3413.50 --> 3414.68]  They are prophesying,
[3415.12 --> 3416.36]  serving, teaching,
[3416.90 --> 3418.16]  encouraging, giving,
[3418.94 --> 3420.04]  leading, and showing
[3420.04 --> 3420.36]  mercy.
[3421.28 --> 3422.10]  Now, this is important.
[3422.50 --> 3423.64]  We are not going to
[3423.64 --> 3424.64]  dissect those seven
[3424.64 --> 3425.86]  gifts this morning
[3425.86 --> 3427.60]  because this list of
[3427.60 --> 3428.44]  gifts is not an
[3428.44 --> 3429.20]  exhaustive one.
[3429.40 --> 3430.32]  This is not all of the
[3430.32 --> 3431.40]  gifts that God gives us.
[3431.66 --> 3432.90]  There are lists throughout
[3432.90 --> 3434.40]  the New Testament from
[3434.40 --> 3435.40]  Paul as well as other
[3435.40 --> 3436.56]  writers that tell us
[3436.56 --> 3436.72]  this.
[3436.78 --> 3437.52]  In 1 Corinthians
[3437.52 --> 3438.80]  chapter 12, Paul
[3438.80 --> 3439.72]  actually gives us a list
[3439.72 --> 3441.32]  of 13 more gifts.
[3441.32 --> 3442.42]  And only two of them
[3442.42 --> 3443.24]  are duplicates from
[3443.24 --> 3444.14]  this morning's text.
[3444.54 --> 3445.14]  And in Ephesians
[3445.14 --> 3446.16]  chapter 4, there's another
[3446.16 --> 3447.56]  list of five where there's
[3447.56 --> 3448.52]  only three duplicates.
[3448.60 --> 3449.64]  And then there's many
[3449.64 --> 3450.60]  other spots in the New
[3450.60 --> 3451.60]  Testament that list
[3451.60 --> 3453.50]  specific gifts that the
[3453.50 --> 3454.52]  Holy Spirit grants to
[3454.52 --> 3456.84]  those who believe.
[3457.10 --> 3457.98]  And the point is this.
[3458.94 --> 3459.74]  While we could go into
[3459.74 --> 3460.90]  detail about these gifts,
[3461.28 --> 3462.62]  the point of the passage
[3462.62 --> 3464.10]  is not to exhaust these
[3464.10 --> 3465.52]  specific ones necessarily,
[3465.92 --> 3467.88]  but to use this list of
[3467.88 --> 3470.06]  seven gifts as an example
[3470.06 --> 3471.66]  of how we are called to
[3471.66 --> 3473.10]  use our gifts in the
[3473.10 --> 3474.66]  world, which is, as we've
[3474.66 --> 3476.26]  been saying, with humility
[3476.26 --> 3478.04]  and for the church.
[3480.22 --> 3481.48]  Scripture beyond this
[3481.48 --> 3482.84]  passage tells us this as
[3482.84 --> 3483.04]  well.
[3483.42 --> 3484.74]  If you want to compare
[3484.74 --> 3486.20]  verses 4 to 8 from our
[3486.20 --> 3487.52]  text with the 1 Corinthians
[3487.52 --> 3489.10]  chapter 12 text, you'll
[3489.10 --> 3490.12]  see some very obvious
[3490.12 --> 3490.62]  similarities.
[3491.08 --> 3492.66]  First, Paul uses the same
[3492.66 --> 3494.26]  analogy of the body.
[3494.60 --> 3496.14]  In verses 4 to 5 of our
[3496.14 --> 3497.78]  text today, Paul says this.
[3497.78 --> 3499.50]  He says, for each of us has
[3499.50 --> 3500.98]  one body with many members,
[3501.38 --> 3502.38]  and these members do not
[3502.38 --> 3503.52]  all have the same function.
[3503.94 --> 3505.78]  So in Christ we, though
[3505.78 --> 3507.90]  many, form one body, and
[3507.90 --> 3509.16]  each member belongs to all
[3509.16 --> 3509.60]  the others.
[3510.42 --> 3511.90]  In 1 Corinthians 12, Paul
[3511.90 --> 3513.24]  says much the same thing.
[3514.00 --> 3515.84]  He says, just as a body,
[3516.14 --> 3517.74]  though one has many parts,
[3518.42 --> 3520.14]  but all its many parts form
[3520.14 --> 3520.66]  one body.
[3520.74 --> 3521.62]  So it is with Christ.
[3521.74 --> 3523.84]  The body is not made up of
[3523.84 --> 3525.30]  one part, but of many.
[3525.64 --> 3526.96]  And then in that passage in
[3526.96 --> 3528.04]  Corinthians, Paul goes on to
[3528.04 --> 3529.22]  say how silly it would be
[3529.22 --> 3531.04]  for a foot or an ear to say
[3531.04 --> 3531.88]  that they were less a part
[3531.88 --> 3532.90]  of the body because they
[3532.90 --> 3534.12]  are not a hand or an eye.
[3534.54 --> 3535.34]  But you get the point.
[3535.98 --> 3538.22]  In both passages, Paul is
[3538.22 --> 3539.38]  pointing out that although
[3539.38 --> 3540.72]  we are all gifted in
[3540.72 --> 3542.38]  different ways, we are all
[3542.38 --> 3544.16]  part of the body of Christ.
[3545.30 --> 3548.24]  With Christ as the head, we
[3548.24 --> 3549.12]  make up the body.
[3549.26 --> 3550.30]  We are the church.
[3550.30 --> 3553.44]  Now secondly, comparing those
[3553.44 --> 3555.24]  two passages, Paul describes
[3555.24 --> 3557.24]  how love for one another
[3557.24 --> 3558.88]  plays a massive role in all
[3558.88 --> 3559.26]  of this.
[3559.72 --> 3561.00]  Next week, Pastor Chris is
[3561.00 --> 3562.62]  going to dig into Romans 12,
[3562.76 --> 3564.80]  9 to 21, where Paul talks
[3564.80 --> 3566.16]  extensively about how we are
[3566.16 --> 3566.94]  to love all people.
[3567.32 --> 3568.60]  That's how this living out the
[3568.60 --> 3569.56]  body looks like.
[3570.34 --> 3572.88]  In chapter 12 of 1 Corinthians,
[3573.16 --> 3575.42]  Paul follows his passage on
[3575.42 --> 3576.58]  the body with 1 Corinthians
[3576.58 --> 3578.52]  chapter 13, which is one of
[3578.52 --> 3579.90]  the most famous passages on
[3579.90 --> 3581.04]  love that exists in the
[3581.04 --> 3582.58]  entire Bible.
[3583.22 --> 3583.96]  Love is patient.
[3584.10 --> 3584.70]  Love is kind.
[3584.78 --> 3585.52]  It does not envy.
[3585.64 --> 3586.44]  It does not boast.
[3586.78 --> 3587.72]  Many of you know this
[3587.72 --> 3588.06]  passage.
[3588.50 --> 3589.72]  Many non-Christians know
[3589.72 --> 3590.24]  this passage.
[3590.40 --> 3591.88]  This is like infamously
[3591.88 --> 3594.96]  wedding, infamously famous
[3594.96 --> 3596.16]  at weddings of all shapes
[3596.16 --> 3596.66]  and sizes.
[3597.48 --> 3600.02]  All of this to say, in both
[3600.02 --> 3601.18]  texts, this is the point.
[3602.62 --> 3606.22]  In both texts, we see how
[3606.22 --> 3608.66]  corporate Christianity is.
[3610.32 --> 3611.24]  Now, sure, our faith is
[3611.24 --> 3613.14]  personal, but it is not
[3613.14 --> 3614.14]  individualistic.
[3615.40 --> 3617.36]  Paul is urging those who
[3617.36 --> 3619.52]  believe that we need to be
[3619.52 --> 3620.94]  operating in community.
[3621.50 --> 3623.08]  We need to be a part of the
[3623.08 --> 3624.80]  body of Christ, not separate
[3624.80 --> 3625.58]  from the church.
[3625.94 --> 3628.32]  Using our gifts must happen
[3628.32 --> 3629.22]  within the church.
[3629.22 --> 3633.14]  This quote from Kevin DeYoung,
[3633.20 --> 3633.86]  I think it's awesome.
[3633.94 --> 3635.04]  It's from his book titled
[3635.04 --> 3636.54]  The Hole in Our Holiness, and
[3636.54 --> 3637.98]  it sums it up perfectly and
[3637.98 --> 3638.78]  quite pointedly.
[3638.94 --> 3639.52]  It says this,
[3640.22 --> 3643.00]  We cannot live as Christians
[3643.00 --> 3644.06]  without the church.
[3644.78 --> 3647.42]  We cannot love Christ and not
[3647.42 --> 3648.06]  love the church.
[3648.56 --> 3651.50]  We cannot embrace Christ and
[3651.50 --> 3653.76]  not embrace those for whom
[3653.76 --> 3654.52]  Christ died.
[3654.52 --> 3658.02]  We cannot trust Christ for
[3658.02 --> 3660.74]  salvation and then refuse to
[3660.74 --> 3662.14]  trust those whom Christ has
[3662.14 --> 3664.08]  given spiritual oversight.
[3664.98 --> 3667.58]  We cannot love Christ and
[3667.58 --> 3669.66]  ignore the gifts of Christ.
[3669.78 --> 3671.58]  We cannot be devoted to Christ
[3671.58 --> 3673.52]  but be detached from Christ's
[3673.52 --> 3673.80]  bride.
[3675.08 --> 3677.80]  To divorce our love for Christ
[3677.80 --> 3680.40]  from our love for the church is
[3680.40 --> 3682.76]  to decapitate the head from the
[3682.76 --> 3685.44]  body, a decorpsified Christ.
[3689.22 --> 3690.62]  We are the body.
[3690.82 --> 3693.44]  We are to be edified by each
[3693.44 --> 3693.62]  other.
[3693.72 --> 3695.52]  Edified simply means improved,
[3695.68 --> 3697.02]  informed, built up, encouraged.
[3697.72 --> 3699.82]  We need to be part of a local
[3699.82 --> 3701.82]  church to be edified by the
[3701.82 --> 3702.76]  gifts of others.
[3703.84 --> 3705.74]  Or more directly and more
[3705.74 --> 3708.94]  specifically, you need to be part
[3708.94 --> 3711.66]  of a local church because others
[3711.66 --> 3713.68]  need to be edified by your
[3713.68 --> 3714.14]  gifts.
[3716.16 --> 3717.86]  Gifts are not given to us by
[3717.86 --> 3719.32]  God for our own enjoyment or
[3719.32 --> 3721.96]  for our own self-exaltation or
[3721.96 --> 3723.70]  to build up our own brands or
[3723.70 --> 3724.28]  platforms.
[3724.46 --> 3726.62]  God has given us these gifts, be
[3726.62 --> 3728.84]  it teaching or giving or
[3728.84 --> 3730.50]  encouragement or showing mercy or
[3730.50 --> 3731.74]  one of the dozens of other
[3731.74 --> 3733.52]  gifts he lists in his word.
[3733.80 --> 3734.94]  He gives them for one reason.
[3736.24 --> 3739.08]  Because Christ loves the church
[3739.08 --> 3741.36]  church and we are to use our
[3741.36 --> 3743.28]  gifts for the good of our
[3743.28 --> 3745.60]  brothers and sisters in Christ.
[3745.60 --> 3751.36]  Now God gives us all gifts.
[3752.66 --> 3754.02]  And some of you here sitting
[3754.02 --> 3756.56]  today know very well what gifts
[3756.56 --> 3758.08]  God has given you, what gifts you
[3758.08 --> 3758.38]  possess.
[3759.02 --> 3760.48]  And some of you are using your
[3760.48 --> 3761.92]  gifts so well in this community
[3761.92 --> 3763.88]  and we thank you for that.
[3764.56 --> 3765.86]  Others of you know the gifts you
[3765.86 --> 3767.02]  have and you need to be encouraged
[3767.02 --> 3768.72]  to go and give of those gifts to
[3768.72 --> 3769.20]  this community.
[3769.30 --> 3770.28]  So please do that.
[3771.64 --> 3773.24]  Others of you might be struggling to
[3773.24 --> 3774.76]  figure out what your gifts actually
[3774.76 --> 3775.10]  are.
[3776.44 --> 3777.98]  And if that's true, can I please
[3777.98 --> 3779.92]  just encourage you, go talk to
[3779.92 --> 3780.28]  someone.
[3780.92 --> 3782.00]  Someone who knows you well.
[3782.12 --> 3783.22]  Talk to a friend.
[3783.54 --> 3785.10]  Talk to a spiritual mentor, a
[3785.10 --> 3786.32]  pastor, a parent, an elder.
[3786.62 --> 3788.02]  Talk to someone who knows you.
[3788.76 --> 3789.46]  They can help.
[3789.56 --> 3790.52]  They know your gifts.
[3791.30 --> 3792.94]  They will see what your role can
[3792.94 --> 3794.16]  be in the body of Christ.
[3796.08 --> 3797.48]  We've all been given gifts.
[3797.48 --> 3799.84]  Every one of us because of
[3799.84 --> 3800.20]  Christ.
[3801.20 --> 3802.64]  None of us have earned these
[3802.64 --> 3802.96]  gifts.
[3802.96 --> 3805.46]  We have not received them because
[3805.46 --> 3806.34]  we deserve them.
[3808.38 --> 3810.04]  We've received them because God
[3810.04 --> 3811.86]  drew us to faith by his grace.
[3812.78 --> 3814.40]  And now we are called to give of
[3814.40 --> 3815.70]  those gifts back to the church.
[3816.62 --> 3821.14]  Remember, Jesus came to this earth
[3821.14 --> 3823.36]  and he lived the life that you and
[3823.36 --> 3824.92]  I have been called to live and yet
[3824.92 --> 3827.00]  he died a death that you and I
[3827.00 --> 3827.98]  deserve to die.
[3828.42 --> 3830.34]  He then, three days later, rose from
[3830.34 --> 3832.70]  the dead, revealed himself to many
[3832.70 --> 3834.62]  people and then rose up to heaven
[3834.62 --> 3836.14]  where now he sits at the right hand
[3836.14 --> 3837.16]  of God the Father Almighty.
[3837.92 --> 3840.96]  The gifts he gives us are meant to
[3840.96 --> 3843.28]  be used for the betterment of the
[3843.28 --> 3844.98]  church, to help the church, to grow
[3844.98 --> 3848.22]  the church, to spread the gospel
[3848.22 --> 3851.10]  truth of Jesus' life, death, and
[3851.10 --> 3851.72]  resurrection.
[3851.72 --> 3857.66]  When we use our gifts to love and
[3857.66 --> 3860.78]  serve the body, we love what Jesus
[3860.78 --> 3863.68]  loves, which is the body of Christ.
[3864.52 --> 3865.98]  So be a part of the church and
[3865.98 --> 3868.00]  humbly give yourself to it.
[3868.00 --> 3872.28]  Pastor Chris said a few weeks back
[3872.28 --> 3873.50]  that instead of saying, I don't get
[3873.50 --> 3875.16]  anything out of church, we should be
[3875.16 --> 3877.60]  asking, what can I give to God today
[3877.60 --> 3878.82]  as I enter this place?
[3879.06 --> 3880.22]  And that is so important.
[3880.34 --> 3882.78]  That frames what our posture should be
[3882.78 --> 3884.52]  like as we enter this place each and
[3884.52 --> 3884.98]  every week.
[3886.22 --> 3888.28]  But Paul is adding another layer here.
[3889.54 --> 3891.16]  And he's saying, instead of asking,
[3891.48 --> 3892.82]  what do I get from church?
[3894.06 --> 3896.22]  We need to be asking, what am I giving
[3896.22 --> 3899.26]  to church in order to serve the body?
[3901.16 --> 3902.98]  And so those are the questions to ask
[3902.98 --> 3903.40]  you today.
[3905.24 --> 3906.64]  Am I a part of the body?
[3908.36 --> 3910.60]  How can I best serve it more?
[3913.16 --> 3915.02]  In conclusion today, I want to share a
[3915.02 --> 3915.70]  little bit of story.
[3915.80 --> 3917.48]  My dad actually sent me a video this
[3917.48 --> 3919.14]  week with no idea that I was preaching,
[3919.36 --> 3921.08]  let alone what I was preaching on.
[3921.50 --> 3924.50]  But the story in this video fits this
[3924.50 --> 3926.14]  text so well and fits what Paul
[3926.14 --> 3926.84]  is saying here.
[3926.98 --> 3928.78]  It's a testimony from a man named
[3928.78 --> 3930.20]  Stephen Foster.
[3930.88 --> 3932.34]  And honestly, it makes way more sense
[3932.34 --> 3933.90]  for him to tell his story than for me.
[3934.00 --> 3935.24]  So it's going to be on the screen in
[3935.24 --> 3935.82]  just a second.
[3936.22 --> 3938.34]  Please watch this two-minute testimony.
[3940.40 --> 3942.60]  If I'm honest, I never really liked the
[3942.60 --> 3942.92]  church.
[3943.08 --> 3945.12]  I didn't even really like Christians that
[3945.12 --> 3945.42]  much.
[3945.50 --> 3946.76]  I used to think of it like a package
[3946.76 --> 3947.10]  deal.
[3947.58 --> 3950.34]  Like, you get Jesus, and so you get the
[3950.34 --> 3951.50]  church and Christians thrown.
[3951.58 --> 3952.54]  It's just part of the package.
[3952.92 --> 3954.52]  And there are some bits you like Jesus,
[3954.52 --> 3955.98]  some bits you don't like so much.
[3956.06 --> 3957.32]  It's like the church and Christians.
[3957.62 --> 3959.00]  I used to find that a bit annoying.
[3959.14 --> 3960.18]  But I turned up to the church and
[3960.18 --> 3960.80]  go through it.
[3961.10 --> 3962.46]  I don't really enjoy going to the
[3962.46 --> 3962.62]  church.
[3962.72 --> 3965.52]  And then one day, I was at the back of
[3965.52 --> 3968.06]  our church in East London, and someone
[3968.06 --> 3972.44]  said to me, oh, we need help to run the
[3972.44 --> 3973.04]  coffee team.
[3973.30 --> 3975.44]  Last night, I was like working like 70,
[3975.52 --> 3976.12]  80 hour a week.
[3976.22 --> 3976.82]  I'm like, what?
[3976.82 --> 3978.48]  And they were like, yeah, Steve, we
[3978.48 --> 3980.32]  really enjoy how running the coffee
[3980.32 --> 3981.40]  team on a Sunday.
[3981.62 --> 3982.88]  And I was like, I'm a pastor.
[3983.08 --> 3983.92]  I'm not a barista.
[3984.10 --> 3984.96]  Like, I've got a job.
[3985.04 --> 3986.04]  I don't even know a job to run the
[3986.04 --> 3986.38]  coffee team.
[3986.68 --> 3988.16]  I just, you know, sometimes you just
[3988.16 --> 3989.18]  can't even think of what to say.
[3989.26 --> 3990.92]  So I was like, okay, I'll do it.
[3990.96 --> 3991.32]  I'll do it.
[3991.36 --> 3991.58]  Okay.
[3991.94 --> 3993.40]  And I said, why did I do that?
[3993.42 --> 3995.20]  So I turn up next week, like, you
[3995.20 --> 3996.88]  know, trying to get the cups and
[3996.88 --> 3998.12]  everything, get the coffee right.
[3998.24 --> 4000.18]  As I handed these cups to people,
[4000.54 --> 4003.14]  something really changed in me.
[4003.14 --> 4005.34]  I found myself as I handed coffee
[4005.34 --> 4007.60]  to these people, growing in love
[4007.60 --> 4007.98]  for them.
[4008.10 --> 4008.86]  I was like, these people are
[4008.86 --> 4009.42]  amazing.
[4010.32 --> 4011.52]  Like, this is this extraordinarily
[4011.52 --> 4012.78]  diverse community.
[4013.54 --> 4015.00]  It's been gathered from across the
[4015.00 --> 4017.30]  area, probably not another place
[4017.30 --> 4019.42]  that looks as diverse and
[4019.42 --> 4020.38]  integrated as this.
[4020.52 --> 4021.28]  This is a miracle.
[4021.58 --> 4023.16]  And then even people I found a
[4023.16 --> 4024.46]  little bit more frustrating and
[4024.46 --> 4026.42]  complicated, as I handed them their
[4026.42 --> 4027.78]  coffee, I kind of grew in love
[4027.78 --> 4028.14]  for them.
[4028.24 --> 4029.94]  And I kind of basically fell in love
[4029.94 --> 4031.10]  with the church.
[4031.58 --> 4032.62]  And then I kind of went back to the
[4032.62 --> 4033.72]  person who'd asked me to, I said,
[4033.90 --> 4034.96]  we need a new coffee machine.
[4035.26 --> 4036.20]  We need better beans.
[4036.52 --> 4037.48]  We need better mugs.
[4037.62 --> 4039.02]  Like, come on, these are amazing
[4039.02 --> 4039.30]  people.
[4039.40 --> 4040.78]  I want this to be the best coffee
[4040.78 --> 4041.40]  that they get.
[4041.54 --> 4042.88]  You know, they're coming to church
[4042.88 --> 4043.72]  on a Sunday morning.
[4043.80 --> 4044.98]  I got more and more passionate.
[4045.12 --> 4046.50]  I started to build a team to serve
[4046.50 --> 4047.60]  coffee on a Sunday morning.
[4047.72 --> 4048.44]  I was sometimes sick.
[4048.84 --> 4050.56]  Making coffee changed my life
[4050.56 --> 4052.66]  because I fell in love with the
[4052.66 --> 4053.60]  church of Jesus Christ.
[4053.72 --> 4055.80]  I didn't realize why it was
[4055.80 --> 4056.02]  special.
[4056.10 --> 4057.86]  I didn't realize why it mattered.
[4059.00 --> 4061.10]  And as I made coffee for people,
[4061.10 --> 4063.10]  I suddenly realized, oh, the church
[4063.10 --> 4065.16]  is like the bride of Jesus Christ.
[4065.22 --> 4067.10]  It's like the thing he gave himself
[4067.10 --> 4067.54]  for.
[4068.12 --> 4071.84]  Like, the church is God's plan for the
[4071.84 --> 4072.90]  salvation of the world.
[4073.28 --> 4074.34]  There's no plan B.
[4074.62 --> 4076.18]  And God is going to build his church.
[4076.58 --> 4078.16]  And the gates of hell will not prevail
[4078.16 --> 4078.94]  against it.
[4079.50 --> 4081.90]  So, like, God is putting all his eggs
[4081.90 --> 4083.08]  in the church basket.
[4083.08 --> 4086.72]  And I realized, over those few weeks,
[4086.90 --> 4088.28]  there's a beautiful thing here.
[4088.46 --> 4089.92]  Yes, it messes up.
[4090.18 --> 4091.26]  Yes, it makes mistakes.
[4091.76 --> 4093.38]  You'll never find a perfect church.
[4094.00 --> 4095.26]  But it's a beautiful thing.
[4096.22 --> 4098.20]  And I thought, that's what I want to
[4098.20 --> 4099.12]  spend my life building.
[4099.12 --> 4099.22]  Amen.
[4104.56 --> 4107.40]  Stephen Foster is actually now a vicar
[4107.40 --> 4110.72]  at St. Aldate's Church in Oxford,
[4110.92 --> 4113.56]  England, all because he decided to use
[4113.56 --> 4116.22]  his gifts and humbly serve his church,
[4116.36 --> 4118.70]  even if he started doing so begrudgingly.
[4119.68 --> 4120.70]  And so what are your gifts?
[4121.44 --> 4122.58]  How are you serving?
[4123.60 --> 4125.90]  We can always use coffee volunteers here
[4125.90 --> 4128.16]  or more prayer ministry people
[4128.16 --> 4130.76]  or people to serve in GEMS or cadets,
[4130.90 --> 4132.32]  men's ministry, coffee break,
[4132.60 --> 4134.32]  connect teams, mission teams,
[4134.70 --> 4137.02]  IT team, social media crew.
[4137.12 --> 4138.06]  I was saying team a lot.
[4138.32 --> 4139.74]  There's a running of the soundboard
[4139.74 --> 4141.30]  or the pro presenter in the back.
[4141.62 --> 4142.54]  There's a kitchen group,
[4142.62 --> 4143.54]  a refugee committee.
[4143.76 --> 4144.62]  There's a board of stewards
[4144.62 --> 4145.68]  who helps maintain the grounds.
[4145.76 --> 4146.32]  I could go on.
[4149.26 --> 4153.60]  Are you a part of the body of Christ?
[4155.14 --> 4157.90]  How can you best serve the body
[4157.90 --> 4159.80]  with the gifts God has given you?
[4161.20 --> 4164.30]  Can we do so humbly because of who Jesus is?
[4165.80 --> 4167.58]  If you do, if we do,
[4168.30 --> 4172.58]  you may just come to love Jesus and his body even more.
[4172.64 --> 4175.26]  And maybe you'll even become a vicar.
[4175.26 --> 4177.08]  Let's pray.
[4178.92 --> 4180.18]  Father in heaven,
[4180.28 --> 4182.20]  we thank you for this text.
[4182.38 --> 4184.82]  We thank you that you have lived
[4184.82 --> 4188.08]  the perfect life that none of us can live
[4188.08 --> 4190.08]  and that you died a death that we all deserve.
[4190.76 --> 4192.84]  And by grace, you rose again three days later,
[4192.94 --> 4194.16]  giving grace to all of us,
[4194.28 --> 4196.72]  forgiveness of sins and life eternal, God.
[4196.72 --> 4202.54]  And there is nothing that we did to deserve that.
[4204.08 --> 4206.72]  May we live out this life
[4206.72 --> 4209.36]  in that humble reality.
[4210.24 --> 4213.00]  May we give of ourselves to the church,
[4213.50 --> 4217.72]  not because we can,
[4218.36 --> 4219.32]  but because you did.
[4219.32 --> 4224.52]  And may we serve our brothers and sisters in Christ.
[4224.64 --> 4226.34]  May we grow this community.
[4226.48 --> 4228.20]  May we grow the church of Christ
[4228.20 --> 4230.28]  because you have given us these gifts.
[4230.42 --> 4233.74]  May we go out and serve our community well
[4233.74 --> 4237.14]  because that is what we are to do
[4237.14 --> 4238.70]  with a renewed mind
[4238.70 --> 4241.04]  and a knowledge of the grace and mercy
[4241.04 --> 4243.04]  that is found in our salvation because of you.
[4243.74 --> 4245.40]  God, we thank you for these gifts.
[4245.40 --> 4248.64]  May we go and use them for your glory.
[4249.00 --> 4250.20]  In your name, amen.
[4275.40 --> 4284.88]  O Lord, hear.
[4284.88 --> 4286.96]  O Lord, hear.
[4286.96 --> 4293.38]  O Lord, forgive us.
[4293.96 --> 4299.80]  We have lost the awe of you.
[4299.80 --> 4303.36]  Have mercy.
[4303.36 --> 4303.42]  Have mercy.
[4303.42 --> 4305.42]  Have mercy.
[4305.42 --> 4306.70]  Have mercy.
[4308.70 --> 4314.90]  O Lord, bless.
[4315.58 --> 4320.70]  Our hearts which are divided
[4320.70 --> 4327.64]  stir the faith that we once knew.
[4327.64 --> 4331.26]  We're thirsty.
[4331.26 --> 4332.26]  We're thirsty.
[4332.26 --> 4333.26]  We're thirsty.
[4333.26 --> 4335.26]  We're thirsty.
[4337.26 --> 4341.26]  O Lord, restore.
[4343.76 --> 4350.66]  The church that is your name.
[4350.66 --> 4356.04]  O Spirit, send.
[4356.04 --> 4386.02]  O Lord, hear.
[4386.02 --> 4393.02]  O Lord, forgive us.
[4393.02 --> 4399.64]  We have lost the awe of you.
[4399.64 --> 4402.64]  Have mercy.
[4402.64 --> 4406.64]  Have mercy.
[4406.64 --> 4407.64]  We have mercy.
[4407.64 --> 4413.64]  O Lord, bless.
[4413.64 --> 4420.40]  Our hearts which are divided
[4420.40 --> 4427.64]  stir the faith that we once knew.
[4427.64 --> 4429.64]  We're thirsty.
[4429.64 --> 4430.64]  We're thirsty.
[4430.64 --> 4431.46]  We're thirsty.
[4434.64 --> 4434.88]  We're thirsty.
[4436.64 --> 4442.64]  No Fighting.
[4443.08 --> 4444.08]  We're thirsty.
[4444.08 --> 4444.70]  We're thirsty.
[4444.70 --> 4446.86]  We're thirsty.
[4446.86 --> 4449.86]  your name
[4449.86 --> 4451.86]  Oh

[4469.86 --> 4472.86]  breathe
[4472.86 --> 4475.78]  on us

[4488.52 --> 4489.92]  that bears
