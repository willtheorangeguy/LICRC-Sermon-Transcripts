[0.00 → 3.30] Death has lost its grip on me.
[3.46 → 6.74] You have broken every chain.
[7.10 → 10.06] There's self-esteem in your name.
[10.32 → 16.16] Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[16.90 → 17.94] Hallelujah.
[20.14 → 23.30] Praise the one who set me free.
[23.68 → 24.60] Hallelujah.
[24.60 → 25.60] Hallelujah.
[26.76 → 29.92] Death has lost its grip on me.
[30.22 → 33.38] You have broken every chain.
[33.76 → 36.68] There's self-esteem in your name.
[36.96 → 43.02] Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[46.48 → 52.12] Then came the morning that sealed the promise.
[52.12 → 58.66] Your bearing body began to breathe.
[58.66 → 62.04] Out of the silence.
[62.04 → 62.68] Out of the silence.
[62.68 → 65.62] The roaring lion.
[65.62 → 68.40] Declared the grave.
[68.40 → 71.68] Has no claim on me.
[71.68 → 75.72] Then came the morning.
[75.72 → 79.10] Jesus, yours is the victory.
[79.10 → 82.48] Your buried body.
[82.48 → 85.48] Your buried body began to breathe.
[85.48 → 89.42] Out of the silence.
[89.42 → 92.12] The roaring lion.
[92.12 → 95.06] Declared the grave.
[95.06 → 98.62] Has no claim on me.
[98.62 → 104.00] Jesus, yours is the victory.
[104.00 → 104.58] Jesus, yours is the victory.
[104.58 → 109.00] Oh, hallelujah.
[109.00 → 112.38] Oh, hallelujah.
[112.38 → 112.92] Oh, hallelujah.
[112.92 → 116.62] Praise the one who set me free.

[118.38 → 119.38] Hallelujah.
[119.38 → 120.38] Hallelujah.
[120.38 → 123.28] Death has lost its grip on me.
[123.28 → 126.74] You have broken every chain.
[126.88 → 129.98] This time they say your name.
[130.06 → 135.02] Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[135.02 → 165.00] Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[165.00 → 169.82] Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[169.82 → 172.38] Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[172.38 → 175.26] Because you are my living hope.
[195.00 → 215.70] Come and stand before your Maker, full of wonder, full of fear.
[215.70 → 221.26] Come behold His power and glory, yet with confidence strongly.
[221.26 → 233.54] For the One who holds the heavens and commands the stars above, is the God who bents to bless us with an unrelenting love.
[235.46 → 245.36] Rejoice! Come and lift your hands and raise your voice. He is worthy of our praise.
[245.36 → 256.36] Rejoice! Sing the mercies of your King, and with trembling rejoice.
[257.36 → 262.82] We are children of the promise, the beloved of the Lord.
[263.28 → 268.70] One with everlasting kindness, bought with sacrificial blood.
[268.70 → 280.64] Bringing reconciliation to a world that longs to know the affections of a Father who will never let them go.
[282.32 → 289.34] Rejoice! Come and lift your hands and raise your voice.
[289.34 → 291.18] He is worthy of our praise.
[292.70 → 294.30] Good morning.
[294.30 → 298.40] Good morning. Welcome to worship.
[298.92 → 310.16] Welcome to worship on this long weekend Sunday, which might indicate why we're a little bit more spread around than we would otherwise be.
[310.54 → 318.38] But also on this Pentecost Sunday, where we celebrate and recognize the coming of the Holy Spirit in power.
[318.38 → 323.52] And we will hear more about that throughout our worship together this morning.
[323.52 → 326.46] If you're a guest with us here today, my name is Chris.
[326.68 → 334.88] I'm one of the pastors here, and it's my privilege to lead in our shared worship this morning, along with these others and a few more yet that you haven't seen.
[335.58 → 340.14] We have one big announcement, and I'm going to hand that over to Pastor Kevin so he can give it.
[340.94 → 342.00] Good morning, everyone.
[342.16 → 342.80] Oh, there it is.
[342.86 → 343.50] Thanks, Courtney.
[343.80 → 345.82] Big round of applause for Courtney in the back.
[347.30 → 351.84] Our sound people don't get enough love and always get enough, like, stares when something goes wrong.
[351.84 → 352.44] So thanks, Courtney.
[352.96 → 360.88] Youth, if you're out there today, and youth parents, if you're listening as well, today is the deadline to sign up for youth camp, which is happening next weekend at Manning Park.
[361.46 → 364.44] Hopefully you've seen one of my 18 emails about that.
[364.82 → 371.08] If you can get your registration sheets informed into me today, that would be amazing.
[371.18 → 373.90] We have to get numbers and get going on groceries and supplies and stuff this week.
[373.96 → 374.72] So today's the deadline.
[375.20 → 375.80] Sign up today.
[376.16 → 376.74] It'll be awesome.
[376.74 → 380.16] We'll be heading to Manning Park this coming Friday.
[380.36 → 381.36] So hopefully I'll see you on Twitter.
[383.60 → 384.00] Excellent.
[384.14 → 390.18] So I said we had one big announcement, and then we have one little announcement, and that's because the targets of these announcements are the little people among us.
[390.26 → 393.94] But next week is also Cadet Camp Week.
[393.94 → 403.12] And so if you are part of the cadet program, or if you are going to start cadets next year, you're invited to go camping next weekend with those leaders.
[403.90 → 406.18] And so there's been some emails out about that.
[406.24 → 409.20] But if you have questions, you can talk to Andrew.
[409.32 → 410.80] Andrew's going to raise his hand real high.
[410.96 → 411.12] There.
[411.24 → 411.80] That's the guy.
[411.92 → 412.42] Talk to him.
[412.56 → 416.50] He will give you any information you might need for that as well.
[416.50 → 418.92] I believe that's it for us this morning.
[419.16 → 424.36] And so I'm going to invite you, as you're able, to stand, and we might be welcomed into God's presence together.
[429.68 → 435.88] And so open your hearts and receive the greeting of God in our worship.
[435.88 → 448.08] Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus Christ, Son, and our Saviour, through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.
[449.10 → 449.54] Amen.
[450.62 → 453.28] As God's greeted us, I invite you to greet those around you.
[453.28 → 453.78] Amen.
[465.88 → 491.70] On this Pentecost Sunday, hear these words from Acts 2.
[491.70 → 521.58] Let's gather together in worship this morning.
[522.62 → 525.00] Amen.
[525.00 → 525.26] Amen.
[525.50 → 527.36] Amen.
[527.42 → 529.52] Amen.
[532.38 → 533.96] Amen.
[533.96 → 559.00] How lonely is your dwelling place, O Lord Almighty.
[559.00 → 569.00] For my soul longs and even days for you.
[573.00 → 580.00] For here my heart is satisfied.
[580.00 → 585.00] I live in your presence.
[586.00 → 596.00] I see beneath the shadow of your ways.
[596.00 → 606.00] There is one day in your house.
[606.00 → 608.00] There is one day in your voice.
[608.00 → 612.00] Thousands of sweat.
[612.00 → 618.00] There is one day in your house.
[618.00 → 621.00] There is one day in your house.
[621.00 → 624.00] Thousands of sweat.
[624.00 → 627.00] Thousands of sweat.
[627.00 → 631.00] Oh my Lord
[631.00 → 637.00] One thing I asked.
[637.00 → 638.00] And I would seek.
[638.00 → 640.00] To see your Saturday.
[640.00 → 647.50] To find you in the place your glory does.
[647.50 → 659.50] oh
[669.42 → 675.50] manage
[677.50 → 707.48] There is one day in your house, but I'm just ready.

[737.50 → 747.50] There is one day in your house, but I'm just ready.
[747.50 → 759.50] There is one day in your woods, there is one day in your house, there is one day in your words, now I'm just ready.
[759.50 → 771.50] There is one day in your house, but I'm just ready.
[771.50 → 783.50] There is one day in your house, but I'm just ready.
[783.50 → 795.50] There is one day in your house, but I'm just ready.
[795.50 → 807.50] There is one day in your house, but I'm just ready.
[807.50 → 819.50] There is one day in your house, but I'm just ready.
[819.50 → 831.50] There is one day in your house, but I'm just ready.

[907.68 → 915.34] The Lord Jesus come.
[916.86 → 918.40] I invite you to this morning.
[923.70 → 928.62] Our prayer of confession this morning is the words of Psalm 63.
[928.62 → 930.58] Please join me in prayer.
[932.98 → 935.52] You, God, are our God.
[935.92 → 937.38] Earnestly we seek you.
[938.36 → 939.54] We thirst for you.
[939.72 → 945.22] Our whole body longs for you in a dry and parched land where there is no water.
[946.30 → 950.56] We have seen you in the sanctuary and beheld your power and your glory.
[950.96 → 955.58] Because your love is better than life, our lips will glorify you.
[955.58 → 958.92] We will praise you as long as we live.
[959.04 → 961.44] And in your name we will lift our hands.

[979.64 → 980.66] We cling to you.
[981.28 → 983.04] Your right hand holds us.
[983.04 → 986.56] Those who want to kill us will be destroyed.
[987.00 → 989.06] They will go down to the depths of the earth.
[989.56 → 993.02] They will be given over to the sword and become food for jackals.
[994.10 → 997.10] But the king will rejoice in God.
[998.16 → 1001.40] All who swear by God will glory in him.
[1001.94 → 1005.16] While the mouths of liars will be silenced.
[1005.16 → 1008.58] And the beasts will be.
[1008.58 → 1010.02] And we may stand as we sing.
[1010.44 → 1011.72] Breathe out and sing them.

[1254.62 → 1257.58] For I will take you out of the nations.
[1257.58 → 1262.80] I will gather you from all the countries and bring you back into your own land.
[1263.56 → 1267.38] I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean.
[1268.34 → 1271.98] I will cleanse you from all your impurities and from all your idols.
[1271.98 → 1276.48] I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you.
[1277.34 → 1281.18] I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.
[1281.64 → 1287.62] And I will put my spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.

[1291.60 → 1294.84] You will be my people and I will be your God.
[1294.84 → 1324.82] Father, I will be your God.
[1324.82 → 1354.80] Lord, I will be your God.

[1525.82 → 1528.94] Today's offering is for Resonate.
[1529.34 → 1537.50] In 2017, Christian Reform World Missions and Christian Reform Home Missions joined forces and became Resonate.
[1537.50 → 1541.62] Our church partners with Resonate to help build God's church.
[1542.26 → 1549.48] We do this by planting churches and supporting ministry in North America, as well as sending missionaries around the world.
[1550.74 → 1561.92] Resonate is here to walk alongside us in preparing missionaries and volunteers, calling and supporting church planters and campus ministries,
[1561.92 → 1568.96] connecting with ministries overseas, engaging young and old church members in mission work,
[1569.50 → 1574.86] and following the Spirit by discerning new ways to demonstrate and proclaim the gospel.
[1575.54 → 1576.22] Thank you.
[1576.22 → 1606.20] Thank you.
[1606.22 → 1617.22] Turn your eyes upon Jesus, look full in His wonderful ways,
[1617.22 → 1629.96] and the wings of earth will grow strangely dim in the light of His glory and grace.
[1629.96 → 1632.96] Turn your eyes upon Jesus, look full in His glory and grace.
[1632.96 → 1646.12] Turn your eyes to the hillside, where justice and mercy and grace.
[1646.12 → 1657.96] There the Son of God gave His life for us, and our evangelist debt was erased.
[1657.96 → 1663.96] Jesus, Jesus, we lift our hands.
[1663.96 → 1669.96] Jesus, our glory and our power.
[1669.96 → 1675.96] We adore You, behold You, our Saviour ever true.
[1675.96 → 1677.96] O Jesus, we lift our hands.
[1677.96 → 1678.96] O Jesus, we lift our hands.
[1678.96 → 1684.96] Turn your eyes to the morning, and see Christ the Lion away.
[1684.96 → 1696.96] Turn your eyes to the morning, and see Christ the Lion away.
[1696.96 → 1698.96] Lord, we lift our hands.
[1698.96 → 1709.96] What a glorious long fear of death is come, for we carry His life in our grave.
[1709.96 → 1711.96] Jesus, we lift our hands.
[1711.96 → 1715.96] Jesus, we lift our hands.
[1715.96 → 1721.96] Jesus, we lift our hands.
[1721.96 → 1724.96] Jesus, we lift our hands up before it is 끝까지.
[1724.96 → 1725.96] We lift our hands.
[1725.96 → 1727.96] Jesus, our glory and our crown.
[1727.96 → 1730.96] We adore You, behold You, Saviour ever true.
[1730.96 → 1750.44] Turn your eyes to the heavens, our King will return for His own.
[1750.44 → 1762.12] Every knee will bow, every crown will shout, all glory to Jesus alone.
[1764.08 → 1774.90] Jesus, you will lift our hearts. Jesus, our glory and our love.
[1774.90 → 1780.66] We adore You, behold You, our Saviour ever.
[1782.02 → 1786.28] Oh, Jesus, we turn our eyes to You.
[1787.86 → 1792.52] Oh, Jesus, we turn our eyes to You.
[1804.90 → 1813.06] Oh, wow. All right, kids.

[1821.94 → 1822.88] Here we go.
[1826.02 → 1827.88] How is everyone doing this morning?
[1827.88 → 1827.98] Good.
[1831.28 → 1832.86] One of you is good.
[1834.90 → 1837.18] How is everyone this morning?
[1838.58 → 1838.98] Good.
[1839.10 → 1842.90] I have a friend with me, but he's having a nap in the pew over there.
[1843.06 → 1845.94] And in order for him to come out here, you guys are going to have to say,
[1846.34 → 1847.44] Come on out, Hank.
[1847.64 → 1848.76] And then he might join us.
[1848.76 → 1849.16] Are you ready?
[1849.54 → 1850.32] Can you say it together?
[1850.72 → 1851.32] And go.
[1851.32 → 1853.32] Come on, Hank.
[1853.32 → 1862.10] Hi, everyone.
[1865.10 → 1866.50] They're quiet today.
[1866.64 → 1867.68] They're very quiet today.
[1868.18 → 1869.52] Hi, everyone.
[1870.00 → 1870.64] Hi.
[1871.64 → 1874.12] Hank, guess what we're going to talk about today in children's worship time?
[1874.44 → 1874.72] What?
[1874.72 → 1877.64] We're going to talk about our rescuer.
[1877.94 → 1880.16] Oh, I was rescued.
[1880.54 → 1881.02] You were?
[1881.44 → 1881.78] Yeah.
[1881.88 → 1883.74] It's my origin story.
[1884.24 → 1885.62] Your origin story?
[1886.06 → 1886.56] Yeah.
[1887.26 → 1888.70] Should we, could you tell it for us?
[1888.76 → 1890.32] Should we hear Hank's origin story?
[1890.80 → 1891.14] Yeah.
[1891.26 → 1891.56] Yeah?
[1891.56 → 1892.52] Where he came from?
[1893.24 → 1894.96] It's an exciting story.
[1894.96 → 1899.48] I lived in an attic for a long time.
[1899.88 → 1907.54] And then one day, someone put me in a bag with a bunch of old shirts and some books and I think a hammock.
[1908.04 → 1913.38] And I ended up at the Mission Thrift Store.
[1913.86 → 1915.92] The Mission Thrift Store.
[1916.20 → 1916.68] Yeah.
[1916.84 → 1918.74] It was a beautiful place.
[1918.74 → 1927.26] But I was only there for a day when a nice lady bought me and brought me here and gave me to you.
[1927.68 → 1928.12] Me?
[1928.58 → 1929.02] Yeah.
[1929.78 → 1932.88] And so, I live here now on top of your fridge.
[1933.08 → 1933.74] That's true.
[1934.30 → 1938.24] So that lady rescued me from the store.
[1938.80 → 1939.10] Huh.
[1939.80 → 1941.16] I never really thought of it that way.
[1941.42 → 1942.62] That's kind of true, isn't it?
[1943.14 → 1944.40] Was he rescued from the store?
[1945.42 → 1946.16] Yeah, kind of.
[1946.46 → 1947.04] Well, guess what?
[1947.04 → 1951.76] We're going to talk about an even better rescue mission today in Sunday school or in children's worship time.
[1951.98 → 1952.68] Isn't that exciting?
[1952.94 → 1954.34] That does sound exciting.
[1954.96 → 1956.36] So, I'm going to pray.
[1956.90 → 1959.06] And then we're going to run off to children's worship time.
[1959.36 → 1959.72] Slowly.
[1963.72 → 1964.16] Slowly.
[1965.16 → 1966.44] I'm watching you.
[1968.00 → 1970.28] And then we'll go enjoy ourselves in children's worship time, okay?
[1970.42 → 1971.48] So, before we do that, let's pray.
[1971.62 → 1972.22] Can we bow our heads?
[1972.30 → 1972.76] Hold our hands?
[1973.22 → 1973.58] Here we go.
[1973.58 → 1974.84] Dear God, thank you so much for this day.
[1974.84 → 1979.26] Thank you that we could come to church this morning and that we could learn more about you in children's worship time.
[1979.30 → 1983.70] And we pray for all the grown-ups who are going to learn more about you here in church today, too.
[1984.34 → 1987.20] Help us glorify you in the way we do that today.
[1987.26 → 1987.74] In your name.
[1988.14 → 1988.34] Amen.
[1988.68 → 1989.08] All right.
[1989.16 → 1989.72] Stand up.
[1989.76 → 1990.76] It's time to do the blessing.
[1991.62 → 1992.68] You too, church.
[1993.58 → 1993.98] All right.
[1994.02 → 1996.64] We're going to say, the Lord be with you at the same time.
[1996.66 → 1997.10] Are you ready?
[1997.10 → 1997.16] Ready?
[1997.80 → 1999.12] One, two, three.
[1999.12 → 2001.42] The Lord be with you.
[2001.56 → 2003.24] And also with you.
[2003.24 → 2004.68] All right.
[2004.68 → 2004.96] All right.
[2004.96 → 2023.10] Good morning.
[2023.10 → 2023.14] Good morning.
[2023.72 → 2024.44] My name is Darrell.
[2024.50 → 2025.86] I'm one of the elders here at Emmanuel.
[2026.92 → 2031.16] Before I go into our congregational prayer, I just wanted to share a bit of an experience this week.
[2032.00 → 2037.30] We've talked as elders in meetings and such about stretching, about God stretching us in our faith.
[2037.50 → 2039.34] And it's been an interesting week for me.
[2039.42 → 2044.24] I've had a couple of encounters where people have just randomly come up to me and said,
[2044.52 → 2045.18] Are you a Christian?
[2046.00 → 2049.42] And we've had some perfect faith-stretching conversations.
[2049.78 → 2052.98] And it's helped me to delve more into the word.
[2053.74 → 2056.22] And then I find out that I'm on congregational prayer.
[2056.46 → 2059.10] And so that's also something that stretches me as well.
[2059.10 → 2064.62] And so I just encourage everyone to look for opportunities where God might be stretching you this week.
[2065.22 → 2067.38] Let's go to God in our church family prayer.
[2069.08 → 2072.82] Heavenly Father, we come before you today to worship and glorify you.
[2073.44 → 2076.98] Thank you for everyone here and online as we gather together in your name.
[2077.88 → 2084.06] We know and thank you for being a gracious God that accepts us for who we are and where we are in our journey.
[2084.06 → 2091.06] Please guide us in our lives each day to discover your will and the tasks that you have set out for us.
[2091.52 → 2094.02] Give us your spirit to strengthen us in our daily lives.
[2095.06 → 2100.00] We pray for the cadet and the youth campouts coming up this coming weekend.
[2100.88 → 2108.46] And as our ministries wind down for the year, Lord, we are deeply thankful for all the leaders and volunteers who have faithfully given their time and energy.
[2108.46 → 2113.96] Their dedication and service have been a tremendous blessing to our church family.
[2114.38 → 2117.02] We ask that you bless them abundantly for their efforts.
[2117.88 → 2121.60] We take great joy in your word, Lord, as in 2 Corinthians 6.
[2122.12 → 2125.54] As God's co-workers, we urge you not to receive God's grace in vain.
[2126.18 → 2128.86] For he says, in the time of my favour, I heard you.
[2129.34 → 2131.36] In the day of salvation, I helped you.
[2131.70 → 2133.76] I tell you, now is the time of God's favour.
[2134.22 → 2135.54] Now is the day of salvation.
[2135.54 → 2140.00] Lord, we also lift the upcoming meetings of classes and synod.
[2140.42 → 2141.52] These gatherings are critical.
[2142.18 → 2144.84] And we pray for wisdom, discernment, and unity.
[2145.48 → 2148.66] And significant conversations and decisions are made.
[2149.40 → 2153.06] We especially pray for Pastor Chris, who will serve as a delegate for synod this year.
[2153.76 → 2160.10] Grant him clarity, courage, and guidance as he represents our congregation and seeks to honour you in all discussions.
[2160.10 → 2165.94] As we approach this long weekend, we ask for your protection over those that will be travelling.
[2166.20 → 2167.36] Keep them safe on the roads.
[2167.76 → 2171.34] And may they find rest and joy in their journeys and time spent with loved ones.
[2172.18 → 2176.68] Lastly, we thank you for those that accepted nominations for the offices of Elder and Deacon.
[2176.68 → 2182.92] As we continue the process to affirm these names, we seek your divine guidance and wisdom in this process.
[2183.48 → 2187.90] Asking that you make it clear your will for this congregation and council of this church.
[2188.56 → 2196.10] We also pray for future elders and deacons, Lord, that you may make it clear to them if this is a calling and a will for them to serve.
[2196.68 → 2201.30] We thank you, Lord, for hearing our prayers and for your constant presence in our lives.
[2201.72 → 2203.84] We entrust all these matters into your loving hands.
[2204.54 → 2205.56] In Jesus' name we pray.
[2205.56 → 2206.42] Amen.
[2206.68 → 2207.68] Amen.
[2223.68 → 2233.90] We're going to continue our worship by looking at two passages this morning from scriptures.
[2233.90 → 2247.98] In the sort of liturgical movements of the church this season, we've been living in the Gospel of Matthew for the story and then stretching that out for our understanding of what that story means.
[2247.98 → 2258.82] And so on Pentecost this morning, we're going to read from Matthew 28, 16 to 20, and then from Acts 2, 36 to 41.
[2260.10 → 2264.62] I encourage you to have that open in front of you and a Bible in your hands.
[2264.62 → 2265.62] It should be on the Bible.
[2265.62 → 2266.62] It should be on the Bible.
[2266.62 → 2267.62] It should be on the Bible.
[2267.62 → 2268.80] It should be on the screen behind me, at least the first time we go through it.
[2269.58 → 2270.54] Let's read together.
[2272.46 → 2273.62] From Matthew 28.
[2273.62 → 2280.28] Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
[2281.08 → 2283.90] When they saw him, they worshipped him, but some doubted.
[2284.40 → 2286.42] Then Jesus came to them and said,
[2286.42 → 2290.68] All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[2291.34 → 2299.46] Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
[2299.74 → 2303.52] and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.
[2304.02 → 2309.62] And surely I am with you always to the very end of the age.
[2309.62 → 2317.40] And then from Acts 2, we'll start at verse 36.
[2319.22 → 2327.38] Just to get us to that point, Jackie read for us already the story of the Holy Spirit coming in to the disciples
[2327.38 → 2332.90] as they gathered in that upper room in Jerusalem and descending upon them in tongues of fire.
[2333.56 → 2339.58] After that, they went out, and they started preaching to the people who were gathered there for the Jewish festival.
[2339.62 → 2346.76] And everyone heard the disciples in their own language, in the country that they came from,
[2346.82 → 2349.22] the region that they came from, in the language of that area.
[2349.34 → 2350.92] And they were amazed.
[2351.48 → 2353.44] And then Peter begins preaching.
[2354.48 → 2362.56] And he preaches to them the history of redemption culminating in the person and work of Jesus Christ.
[2362.56 → 2366.26] And so he says to them in verse 36,
[2366.26 → 2371.06] Therefore, let all Israel be assured of this.
[2371.66 → 2377.52] God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah.
[2378.80 → 2382.68] When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart.
[2383.72 → 2385.72] And said to Peter and the other apostles,
[2385.98 → 2387.24] Brothers, what shall we do?
[2387.24 → 2389.34] Peter replied,
[2389.34 → 2389.36] Peter replied,
[2389.56 → 2392.48] Repent and be baptized, every one of you,
[2392.72 → 2395.82] in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins,
[2395.98 → 2399.24] and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[2399.58 → 2403.78] The promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off,
[2403.84 → 2406.30] for all whom the Lord our God will call.
[2407.80 → 2411.28] With many other words, he warned them, and he pleaded with them,
[2411.90 → 2415.04] Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.
[2415.04 → 2418.12] Those who accepted his message were baptized,
[2418.76 → 2422.42] and about 3,000 were added to their number that day.
[2423.14 → 2424.60] This is the word of the Lord.
[2430.28 → 2434.92] So whenever we come into the season of Pentecost,
[2435.44 → 2441.42] at least in the areas of my life and the circles that I travel in,
[2441.50 → 2442.88] the conversations that I have,
[2442.88 → 2451.02] we always come to the idea or to the question of what is and who is,
[2451.52 → 2455.22] what is the work of the Holy Spirit, and who is the Holy Spirit?
[2455.32 → 2458.28] What does it mean to be in the Spirit?
[2459.80 → 2468.04] Now part of that conversation and question takes a particular form in today's world
[2468.04 → 2469.96] and in our cultural context.
[2469.96 → 2476.56] Because it's not uncommon to hear people talk about being spiritual,
[2477.76 → 2479.66] whatever that means, right?
[2479.76 → 2485.94] Because that's an intentionally nebulous kind of language
[2485.94 → 2491.28] for people increasingly not connected to church
[2491.28 → 2494.48] or to faith in a traditional sense,
[2494.48 → 2497.92] but they feel connected to the earth
[2497.92 → 2502.88] or connected to something or someone in some way.
[2503.54 → 2506.52] They say, I'm not religious, but I'm spiritual.
[2508.26 → 2510.26] And when we use that kind of language,
[2510.26 → 2518.58] I think that we are intentionally muddying the waters
[2518.58 → 2521.24] about what it means to be in the Spirit,
[2521.86 → 2524.56] in part because we don't know
[2524.56 → 2528.26] and in part because we're not sure if we want to know.
[2529.26 → 2531.52] I think also, one of the other ways,
[2531.52 → 2534.92] maybe on the other side of the spectrum of this conversation,
[2535.62 → 2537.68] especially at this time,
[2537.82 → 2541.80] Christians will talk about being Spirit-filled, right?
[2541.84 → 2544.90] And being Spirit-filled has a particular connotation
[2544.90 → 2547.36] and a particular meaning to us as well.
[2547.76 → 2551.56] And in some places, that means dancing in the aisles.
[2551.82 → 2553.50] Clearly, that's not what it means here.
[2554.12 → 2556.98] In some places, it means speaking in tongues
[2556.98 → 2558.88] or offering prophecy.
[2560.32 → 2562.58] That's less so, I think, what it means here,
[2562.68 → 2564.58] although we have heard some and seen things.
[2564.68 → 2566.32] Let's not mistake those realities.
[2569.42 → 2571.06] But the question, then,
[2571.12 → 2573.68] of what it means to be Spirit-filled
[2573.68 → 2577.54] usually ends up kind of circling
[2577.54 → 2580.74] around a sort of experience
[2580.74 → 2584.26] or an idea of an experience,
[2584.26 → 2587.44] a particularly emotionally laden one
[2587.44 → 2588.42] and heavy one.
[2589.14 → 2592.18] And unless we have that kind of experience,
[2593.38 → 2596.56] we conclude we're not Spirit-filled.
[2597.00 → 2599.78] Or at least we're not as filled as we could be.
[2601.18 → 2602.94] What I want to suggest this morning,
[2603.36 → 2605.00] based on the text that we read
[2605.00 → 2606.96] and what we know and see in the Bible,
[2607.56 → 2612.08] is that being spiritual isn't enough
[2612.08 → 2614.26] and being Spirit-filled
[2614.26 → 2619.26] isn't about a particular experience
[2619.26 → 2621.52] or not an emotive,
[2621.66 → 2624.56] sort of expressive kind of experience.
[2624.62 → 2625.66] It might include that,
[2625.76 → 2627.58] but it's not starting there.
[2627.70 → 2628.30] And to do that,
[2628.36 → 2629.32] what I would like to do
[2629.32 → 2631.60] is to look very closely,
[2631.76 → 2633.20] and if you have your printed sheets,
[2633.30 → 2635.64] you'll see the title of this sermon
[2635.64 → 2638.04] is that the work of the Holy Spirit
[2638.04 → 2640.60] equals the mission of the church.
[2640.60 → 2643.14] So I want to suggest
[2643.14 → 2645.98] that as we hold out these two ideas
[2645.98 → 2647.82] and compare them to one another,
[2648.04 → 2650.14] we'll begin to see something,
[2650.62 → 2652.34] I hope, very clearly
[2652.34 → 2653.90] and very compelling.
[2655.48 → 2657.08] And so the big idea,
[2657.24 → 2658.08] as you can see on the screen,
[2658.18 → 2659.92] is that the mission of the church
[2659.92 → 2663.74] equals the work of the Holy Spirit.
[2664.30 → 2665.74] Or, I'll put it another way,
[2665.82 → 2666.38] more explicitly,
[2666.38 → 2668.80] the work of the Holy Spirit
[2668.80 → 2672.08] is the mission of the church.
[2674.48 → 2676.32] And what I hope we'll see this morning
[2676.32 → 2677.56] is that this isn't just
[2677.56 → 2679.72] some abstract theological point
[2679.72 → 2681.62] made by a pastor
[2681.62 → 2682.82] with a university degree
[2682.82 → 2683.78] and a master's degree.
[2684.04 → 2686.76] This isn't just some rhetorical truism
[2686.76 → 2688.72] hoping to stir something in you.
[2688.98 → 2690.08] Instead, what I hope
[2690.08 → 2691.14] that we will begin to see
[2691.14 → 2693.38] is just how vital
[2693.38 → 2696.04] this truth is
[2696.04 → 2697.46] for the life of the church.
[2699.00 → 2700.04] When I use the word vital,
[2700.48 → 2703.18] I mean integral to our existence.
[2704.26 → 2704.48] Right?
[2704.56 → 2705.96] Giving us life.
[2708.10 → 2708.60] Right?
[2708.66 → 2709.40] For what you do,
[2710.02 → 2711.10] for who you are,
[2711.52 → 2714.14] for how you show up in the world,
[2714.44 → 2715.34] how we live,
[2715.64 → 2717.16] how we move through
[2717.16 → 2719.30] this time and this space.
[2721.18 → 2722.24] Now, to get there,
[2723.00 → 2723.68] we're going to spend
[2723.68 → 2725.32] a little bit of time
[2725.32 → 2726.80] on both sides
[2726.80 → 2728.56] of this equation
[2728.56 → 2731.08] in order to make the most sense
[2731.08 → 2732.86] of what the work
[2732.86 → 2734.24] of the Holy Spirit is
[2734.24 → 2735.48] and then what the mission
[2735.48 → 2737.10] of the church is.
[2738.52 → 2738.84] And so,
[2739.30 → 2740.90] dig into this with me
[2740.90 → 2741.78] for a moment
[2741.78 → 2742.30] and then
[2742.30 → 2744.50] when we pull this together,
[2744.64 → 2745.46] I hope you will see
[2745.46 → 2747.12] what I see here.
[2748.16 → 2749.58] The Holy Spirit
[2749.58 → 2750.76] works
[2750.76 → 2752.14] to make union
[2752.14 → 2753.56] with Jesus possible
[2753.56 → 2755.22] through faith
[2755.22 → 2756.92] and to grow
[2756.92 → 2757.54] the faith
[2757.54 → 2758.90] of those who already believe
[2758.90 → 2760.26] in order
[2760.26 → 2761.62] to make much
[2761.62 → 2762.52] of the person
[2762.52 → 2763.44] and work of Jesus.
[2764.30 → 2764.48] And so,
[2764.56 → 2765.98] this is on the one side
[2765.98 → 2767.14] of the equation,
[2767.24 → 2768.22] the work of the Holy Spirit.
[2768.40 → 2769.66] The work of the Holy Spirit
[2769.66 → 2770.90] is to make union
[2770.90 → 2772.18] with Jesus possible
[2772.18 → 2773.04] through faith
[2773.04 → 2774.20] to grow faith
[2774.20 → 2775.50] in those who already believe
[2775.50 → 2777.18] in order to make much
[2777.18 → 2777.96] of the work
[2777.96 → 2779.54] of Jesus.
[2780.24 → 2780.46] So,
[2780.52 → 2781.24] in that sentence,
[2781.48 → 2783.02] you hear three things,
[2783.10 → 2783.28] right?
[2783.60 → 2785.02] The union with Christ
[2785.02 → 2785.76] through faith,
[2786.26 → 2787.96] maturing our union
[2787.96 → 2788.96] with Christ
[2788.96 → 2789.60] through faith,
[2789.66 → 2790.80] and then the third one,
[2790.96 → 2792.58] exalting in the person
[2792.58 → 2793.12] and work
[2793.12 → 2794.04] of Jesus.
[2794.04 → 2794.22] Jesus.
[2795.04 → 2797.90] I heard someone
[2797.90 → 2798.84] this week
[2798.84 → 2800.64] say that the
[2800.64 → 2801.76] greatest
[2801.76 → 2803.74] doctrinal teaching
[2803.74 → 2805.32] that is lacking
[2805.32 → 2806.88] in the Christian church
[2806.88 → 2807.32] today,
[2807.54 → 2807.90] primarily
[2807.90 → 2809.48] in the Western
[2809.48 → 2810.20] church,
[2810.42 → 2811.50] is the doctrine
[2811.50 → 2812.56] of the union
[2812.56 → 2813.50] with Christ.
[2813.50 → 2813.54] Christ.
[2814.84 → 2815.04] Right?
[2815.08 → 2815.98] The idea that you
[2815.98 → 2817.04] are not your own,
[2817.12 → 2817.98] but you belong,
[2818.28 → 2818.94] body and soul
[2818.94 → 2819.90] and life and in death,
[2820.06 → 2820.76] to Jesus.
[2820.94 → 2821.72] The idea that
[2821.72 → 2823.04] because of grace
[2823.04 → 2823.74] through faith,
[2823.88 → 2825.26] you have been united
[2825.26 → 2826.40] with Christ
[2826.40 → 2827.16] in his life
[2827.16 → 2827.96] and in his death
[2827.96 → 2828.88] and in his resurrection
[2828.88 → 2830.46] and in his exaltation.
[2830.82 → 2831.76] The idea that
[2831.76 → 2832.84] this union
[2832.84 → 2833.62] with Christ
[2833.62 → 2835.00] is indivisible
[2835.00 → 2836.94] and indissoluble.
[2836.94 → 2837.46] That is,
[2837.50 → 2838.34] you can't separate
[2838.34 → 2839.04] from him
[2839.04 → 2839.94] and your union
[2839.94 → 2840.32] with him
[2840.32 → 2841.46] cannot be destroyed.
[2841.46 → 2844.42] These ideas
[2844.42 → 2846.02] fundamentally
[2846.02 → 2848.20] change everything
[2848.20 → 2850.64] about your reality.
[2852.32 → 2854.02] And this is the work
[2854.02 → 2854.86] of the Holy Spirit.
[2856.58 → 2857.82] It starts
[2857.82 → 2858.92] in your heart.
[2859.06 → 2859.64] It starts
[2859.64 → 2860.86] with the seat
[2860.86 → 2862.40] of your affections.
[2863.30 → 2864.18] Notice what we read
[2864.18 → 2865.00] in Acts 2
[2865.00 → 2869.20] in verse 37.
[2869.32 → 2869.90] When the people
[2869.90 → 2870.74] heard this,
[2870.74 → 2871.60] they were cut
[2871.60 → 2873.70] to the heart.
[2875.40 → 2875.88] What we begin
[2875.88 → 2877.00] to see here
[2877.00 → 2877.50] is that
[2877.50 → 2878.42] the work
[2878.42 → 2879.38] of the Holy Spirit
[2879.38 → 2880.30] is not just
[2880.30 → 2880.90] displayed
[2880.90 → 2882.12] in the tongues
[2882.12 → 2883.76] of every nation
[2883.76 → 2884.24] present.
[2884.64 → 2885.20] In fact,
[2885.34 → 2886.60] the greater miracle,
[2886.80 → 2887.54] the greater work
[2887.54 → 2888.44] of the Holy Spirit
[2888.44 → 2889.64] is the piercing
[2889.64 → 2890.78] of hearts
[2890.78 → 2891.96] with conviction
[2891.96 → 2893.48] and with faith.
[2895.00 → 2895.92] We heard earlier
[2895.92 → 2897.04] in worship
[2897.04 → 2899.24] that are hearts
[2899.24 → 2900.28] of stone,
[2900.62 → 2901.72] that turning hearts
[2901.72 → 2902.38] of stone
[2902.38 → 2903.22] into hearts
[2903.22 → 2903.90] of flesh,
[2904.32 → 2905.08] that this granting
[2905.08 → 2906.32] of new life
[2906.32 → 2908.68] is the Spirit's work.
[2909.26 → 2910.06] It's how dead
[2910.06 → 2911.26] in sin bodies
[2911.26 → 2912.24] are raised
[2912.24 → 2913.34] by the blowing
[2913.34 → 2914.88] in of new life
[2914.88 → 2915.94] breathed on you
[2915.94 → 2916.92] by the Holy Spirit.
[2917.98 → 2918.78] And so the act
[2918.78 → 2919.44] of faith
[2919.44 → 2920.42] and of believing
[2920.42 → 2921.90] and so being
[2921.90 → 2923.24] united to Jesus
[2923.24 → 2924.82] is a gift,
[2925.20 → 2926.10] is a working
[2926.10 → 2927.20] in you
[2927.20 → 2928.96] of the Holy Spirit.
[2930.28 → 2931.70] Romans 8, 15
[2931.70 → 2932.06] says,
[2932.56 → 2933.42] the Spirit you received
[2934.00 → 2934.82] brought about
[2934.82 → 2935.66] your adoption
[2935.66 → 2936.76] to son ship.
[2937.76 → 2938.48] Romans 10
[2938.48 → 2939.64] tells us that belief
[2939.64 → 2940.90] comes by hearing
[2940.90 → 2942.00] and specifically
[2942.00 → 2943.24] by hearing the Word,
[2943.36 → 2944.42] by hearing the Gospel.
[2944.98 → 2945.42] And so,
[2945.64 → 2946.44] what the Holy Spirit
[2946.44 → 2947.16] does is
[2947.16 → 2948.54] takes the Gospel,
[2948.72 → 2949.50] takes the Word
[2949.50 → 2950.10] of God
[2950.10 → 2951.06] and makes it
[2951.06 → 2951.90] effective
[2951.90 → 2953.42] in your hearts,
[2953.80 → 2954.74] transforming it
[2954.74 → 2955.22] from a heart
[2955.22 → 2955.86] of stone
[2955.86 → 2956.64] to a heart
[2956.64 → 2957.16] of flesh.
[2957.70 → 2958.80] And then by believing
[2958.80 → 2959.82] the Word,
[2960.00 → 2960.98] we take hold
[2960.98 → 2961.72] of Christ.
[2963.16 → 2964.10] But that believing
[2964.10 → 2965.96] is only made possible,
[2966.18 → 2967.10] only made effective
[2967.10 → 2968.40] because of the
[2968.40 → 2969.70] previous work
[2969.70 → 2970.82] of the Holy Spirit
[2970.82 → 2972.10] in your heart,
[2972.46 → 2973.34] on your heart,
[2973.44 → 2974.66] making it new.
[2977.06 → 2978.86] There's a 16th century
[2978.86 → 2980.02] theologian and pastor,
[2980.74 → 2981.86] his name is John Calvin,
[2982.40 → 2983.48] he's sort of
[2983.48 → 2983.96] the father
[2983.96 → 2985.12] of the Reformed tradition
[2985.12 → 2986.32] that we find ourselves in,
[2986.62 → 2987.96] and he says explicitly,
[2989.02 → 2990.48] without the illumination
[2990.48 → 2991.36] of the Holy Spirit,
[2991.46 → 2993.18] the Word has no effect.
[2994.84 → 2995.24] In fact,
[2995.32 → 2996.14] he goes on to use
[2996.14 → 2996.54] what I think
[2996.54 → 2997.42] is a really compelling
[2997.42 → 2998.72] word picture.
[2998.98 → 2999.46] He says,
[2999.46 → 3001.22] until our minds
[3001.22 → 3001.78] are intent
[3001.78 → 3002.52] on the Spirit,
[3002.74 → 3004.46] Christ is in a manner
[3004.46 → 3005.48] unemployed
[3005.48 → 3007.56] because we view
[3007.56 → 3008.56] him coldly
[3008.56 → 3009.52] without us,
[3009.78 → 3010.82] outside of us,
[3010.88 → 3011.64] at a distance
[3011.64 → 3012.28] from us.
[3012.56 → 3013.68] It is by the Spirit
[3013.68 → 3014.32] alone
[3014.32 → 3015.46] that he unites
[3015.46 → 3015.94] us
[3015.94 → 3017.08] to himself.
[3018.80 → 3019.80] The point here
[3019.80 → 3020.30] is that
[3020.30 → 3021.48] it's only by
[3021.48 → 3022.34] the inner working
[3022.34 → 3023.38] of the Holy Spirit
[3023.38 → 3024.50] that Christ's message
[3024.50 → 3025.20] of salvation
[3025.20 → 3026.40] becomes real,
[3026.52 → 3027.38] becomes effective
[3027.38 → 3028.36] for you.
[3028.96 → 3029.36] And in fact,
[3029.48 → 3030.20] experientially,
[3030.28 → 3031.14] I think all of you
[3031.14 → 3031.72] know this.
[3032.76 → 3032.96] Right?
[3033.00 → 3033.82] You know that this is true
[3033.82 → 3034.98] because if you've ever
[3034.98 → 3037.12] talked with a person
[3037.12 → 3038.50] who is not Christian
[3038.50 → 3040.64] and had them read
[3040.64 → 3041.12] the Bible
[3041.12 → 3042.22] or quoted a Bible
[3042.22 → 3042.94] verse to them
[3042.94 → 3045.20] and nothing happens,
[3046.38 → 3047.22] right,
[3047.24 → 3047.84] you're not surprised
[3047.84 → 3048.36] by that.
[3048.76 → 3050.04] Because if all it took
[3050.04 → 3051.62] was hearing the gospel
[3051.62 → 3052.72] in order for someone
[3052.72 → 3053.44] to believe,
[3053.78 → 3054.66] then the preachers
[3054.66 → 3055.40] that are on street
[3055.40 → 3056.40] corners around the world
[3056.40 → 3057.70] would be much more
[3057.70 → 3058.48] effective than they
[3058.48 → 3059.16] currently are.
[3060.44 → 3061.50] Now, that's not to say
[3061.50 → 3062.28] that the Spirit
[3062.28 → 3063.34] can't use those street
[3063.34 → 3064.14] preachers on corners
[3064.14 → 3064.72] around the world.
[3064.82 → 3065.74] He can, and he does
[3065.74 → 3066.58] and incredible things
[3066.58 → 3067.66] have happened in those
[3067.66 → 3068.74] moments and those places.
[3069.36 → 3070.60] But it's only when
[3070.60 → 3071.56] the Spirit makes
[3071.56 → 3072.62] the word effective
[3072.62 → 3074.44] that our hearts of stone
[3074.44 → 3075.60] are transformed
[3075.60 → 3077.08] into hearts of flesh.
[3077.36 → 3078.66] This is the principal
[3078.66 → 3080.40] work of the Holy Spirit.
[3080.66 → 3081.36] It's the working
[3081.36 → 3082.66] and growing of faith
[3082.66 → 3083.54] in the life
[3083.54 → 3084.42] of the believer
[3084.42 → 3087.16] and that is the means
[3087.16 → 3088.40] of our union
[3088.40 → 3089.72] with Christ.
[3092.00 → 3093.52] And then so connected
[3093.52 → 3094.14] to that
[3094.14 → 3095.82] and working out
[3095.82 → 3096.40] of that
[3096.40 → 3098.00] is the idea
[3098.00 → 3099.26] that the work
[3099.26 → 3100.34] of the Holy Spirit
[3100.34 → 3101.48] then includes
[3101.48 → 3102.92] the maturing,
[3103.46 → 3104.24] the growing
[3104.24 → 3106.00] of our union
[3106.00 → 3106.74] with Christ
[3106.74 → 3107.52] through faith.
[3108.70 → 3109.24] Right, not only
[3109.24 → 3109.72] is the work
[3109.72 → 3110.52] of the Holy Spirit
[3110.52 → 3111.32] the beginning
[3111.32 → 3112.30] of our union
[3112.30 → 3112.98] with Christ,
[3113.06 → 3114.12] it is the ongoing
[3114.12 → 3115.50] work of the Holy Spirit
[3115.50 → 3117.56] that transforms us
[3117.56 → 3118.54] into the image
[3118.54 → 3119.14] of Christ
[3119.14 → 3120.42] through faith.
[3122.04 → 3122.70] Right, and it keeps
[3122.70 → 3124.02] stacking these realities.
[3124.18 → 3125.32] If faith in the word
[3125.32 → 3126.42] is the means
[3126.42 → 3127.46] of our union
[3127.46 → 3128.20] with Christ
[3128.20 → 3129.32] then growing
[3129.32 → 3130.30] in the word
[3130.30 → 3131.28] is the means
[3131.28 → 3132.02] of our growing
[3132.02 → 3132.82] with Christ.
[3133.94 → 3134.72] Now maybe that
[3134.72 → 3135.54] doesn't sound exciting
[3135.54 → 3135.92] to you,
[3135.98 → 3136.58] maybe that doesn't
[3136.58 → 3137.70] sound flashy
[3137.70 → 3138.50] and cool
[3138.50 → 3139.38] and yet there's
[3139.38 → 3140.10] something beautiful
[3140.10 → 3141.32] about its consistency.
[3142.36 → 3143.24] Right, the means
[3143.24 → 3144.34] of our maturing
[3144.34 → 3145.08] of our growing
[3145.08 → 3145.58] in faith
[3145.58 → 3146.58] are the ordinary
[3146.58 → 3147.68] means of grace
[3147.68 → 3149.32] of being in the word
[3149.32 → 3150.08] and of worshipping
[3150.08 → 3151.36] receiving the sacraments
[3151.36 → 3151.74] together.
[3153.26 → 3154.10] In fact, the scriptures
[3154.10 → 3155.70] invite us
[3155.70 → 3156.90] into this truth
[3156.90 → 3158.04] by calling us
[3158.04 → 3158.92] to protect
[3158.92 → 3159.82] the word
[3159.82 → 3160.56] and to cling
[3160.56 → 3161.98] to it fastidiously.
[3162.42 → 3162.80] Right, Paul
[3162.80 → 3163.80] says to Timothy
[3163.80 → 3164.96] a leader
[3164.96 → 3165.78] that he is training
[3165.78 → 3167.00] he says guard
[3167.00 → 3168.04] the good deposit
[3168.04 → 3168.90] that was entrusted
[3168.90 → 3169.48] to you
[3169.48 → 3170.50] guard it
[3170.50 → 3171.14] with the help
[3171.14 → 3172.22] of the Holy Spirit
[3172.22 → 3173.90] who lives in us.
[3175.30 → 3176.02] Right, as we are
[3176.02 → 3176.48] transformed
[3176.48 → 3177.26] by the work
[3177.26 → 3178.12] of the Holy Spirit
[3178.12 → 3178.86] through the word
[3178.86 → 3180.14] working on us
[3180.14 → 3181.66] we begin to see
[3181.66 → 3182.54] the fruit
[3182.54 → 3183.60] of the Holy Spirit
[3183.60 → 3184.82] in our lives
[3184.82 → 3185.82] and Lord willing
[3185.82 → 3187.20] in ever-increasing
[3187.20 → 3187.72] measure.
[3189.00 → 3189.86] Right, Galatians 5
[3189.86 → 3190.70] says the fruit
[3190.70 → 3191.46] of the Spirit
[3191.46 → 3192.08] is love,
[3192.46 → 3192.78] joy,
[3193.06 → 3193.44] peace,
[3193.74 → 3194.20] patience,
[3194.50 → 3194.88] kindness,
[3195.38 → 3195.72] goodness,
[3195.78 → 3196.68] faithfulness,
[3196.84 → 3197.40] gentleness
[3197.40 → 3198.80] and self-control.
[3200.20 → 3200.94] Right, it is the
[3200.94 → 3202.70] ongoing power
[3202.70 → 3204.06] of the Holy Spirit
[3204.06 → 3205.18] in us
[3205.18 → 3206.74] that enables us
[3206.74 → 3207.90] to put off
[3207.90 → 3208.82] the old self
[3208.82 → 3209.78] and all the sin
[3209.78 → 3210.88] that so easily
[3210.88 → 3211.50] entangles
[3211.50 → 3212.32] and to put on
[3212.32 → 3213.18] the new self.
[3213.50 → 3214.26] Right, we put on
[3214.26 → 3214.82] Christ
[3214.82 → 3216.08] in this union.
[3218.42 → 3219.56] One of the reasons
[3219.56 → 3221.38] why the doctrine
[3221.38 → 3222.12] of the union
[3222.12 → 3222.74] with Christ
[3222.74 → 3223.80] is so important
[3223.80 → 3225.18] and why understanding
[3225.18 → 3225.72] the work
[3225.72 → 3226.54] of the Holy Spirit
[3226.54 → 3227.86] to make that real
[3227.86 → 3229.24] is so critical
[3229.24 → 3230.36] to our being
[3230.36 → 3230.90] in the world
[3230.90 → 3231.76] is exactly
[3231.76 → 3233.18] this point.
[3233.94 → 3234.30] Right, because
[3234.30 → 3235.78] the kind of life
[3235.78 → 3237.24] that Jesus calls us
[3237.24 → 3238.26] to, the kind
[3238.26 → 3238.92] of holiness
[3238.92 → 3239.68] that we are
[3239.68 → 3241.18] recreated for
[3241.18 → 3242.22] is impossible
[3242.22 → 3244.04] without the Holy Spirit,
[3244.52 → 3245.42] without our union
[3245.42 → 3245.98] to Jesus.
[3245.98 → 3246.12] Jesus.
[3247.54 → 3248.14] And so,
[3248.60 → 3250.18] what ends up
[3250.18 → 3250.60] happening
[3250.60 → 3252.88] for many of us
[3252.88 → 3255.32] is that we just
[3255.32 → 3255.86] give up
[3255.86 → 3257.48] on trying.
[3259.70 → 3260.40] Right, we have
[3260.40 → 3261.22] become passive
[3261.22 → 3262.66] in our struggles
[3262.66 → 3263.66] against sin.
[3264.90 → 3265.72] Right, we've become
[3265.72 → 3266.48] apathetic
[3266.48 → 3267.22] to the kinds
[3267.22 → 3267.76] of things
[3267.76 → 3268.58] that the Bible
[3268.58 → 3269.48] calls contrary
[3269.48 → 3270.30] to nature,
[3270.30 → 3271.20] that is not
[3271.20 → 3271.70] in the way
[3271.70 → 3272.10] that God
[3272.10 → 3272.58] designed you
[3272.58 → 3273.02] to live.
[3274.60 → 3275.18] And I really
[3275.18 → 3275.92] believe that
[3275.92 → 3277.20] it is in large
[3277.20 → 3278.22] part because
[3278.22 → 3280.00] so many of us
[3280.00 → 3281.56] don't actually
[3281.56 → 3282.68] believe in the
[3282.68 → 3283.62] power of the
[3283.62 → 3284.00] Spirit
[3284.00 → 3285.36] to unite us
[3285.36 → 3286.02] with Christ.
[3288.22 → 3289.18] But this is the
[3289.18 → 3289.70] good news of the
[3289.70 → 3290.10] gospel.
[3291.36 → 3291.88] Right, yes,
[3292.00 → 3292.50] and amen,
[3292.66 → 3293.50] God saves us
[3293.50 → 3294.28] from our sin
[3294.28 → 3295.12] by the life,
[3295.12 → 3295.46] death,
[3295.62 → 3296.02] resurrection,
[3296.18 → 3296.88] and exaltation
[3296.88 → 3297.42] of Jesus.
[3298.20 → 3299.38] But there's more
[3299.38 → 3300.20] and amen
[3300.20 → 3300.88] to that.
[3302.20 → 3302.80] Right, God
[3302.80 → 3303.70] doesn't just
[3303.70 → 3304.96] leave us there
[3304.96 → 3305.96] to figure it out
[3305.96 → 3306.58] on our own
[3306.58 → 3307.28] after he's
[3307.28 → 3308.28] united us
[3308.28 → 3308.74] to Christ.
[3308.82 → 3309.52] Not only does he
[3309.52 → 3310.74] save us from our sin,
[3311.00 → 3311.94] he saves us
[3311.94 → 3313.10] for a life
[3313.10 → 3313.62] lived,
[3313.98 → 3314.84] an abundant,
[3315.48 → 3316.48] deep relationship
[3316.48 → 3317.06] to him.
[3317.32 → 3318.12] He saves us
[3318.12 → 3318.80] for a life
[3318.80 → 3319.50] of gratitude.
[3319.70 → 3320.38] He saves us
[3320.38 → 3321.26] for a life
[3321.26 → 3321.90] of holiness
[3321.90 → 3322.76] and righteousness.
[3323.28 → 3324.02] This is
[3324.02 → 3325.86] what he originally
[3325.86 → 3326.72] designed and
[3326.72 → 3327.68] intended for humans
[3327.68 → 3328.78] to live as image
[3328.78 → 3329.64] bearers of God,
[3329.90 → 3330.64] having dominion
[3330.64 → 3331.44] over the creation,
[3331.64 → 3332.94] ruling with him.
[3334.20 → 3335.16] And he saves us
[3335.16 → 3335.84] for a life
[3335.84 → 3336.92] lived in
[3336.92 → 3337.70] and by
[3337.70 → 3338.48] and through
[3338.48 → 3339.30] the power
[3339.30 → 3340.84] of the Holy Spirit.
[3342.46 → 3343.40] And he grows
[3343.40 → 3344.30] you into
[3344.30 → 3345.62] this image
[3345.62 → 3346.16] to be
[3346.16 → 3347.02] like him.
[3348.24 → 3349.02] The gospel
[3349.02 → 3350.20] is the
[3350.20 → 3351.34] power of God
[3351.34 → 3352.50] unto salvation
[3352.50 → 3353.78] and the
[3353.78 → 3354.54] power of God
[3354.54 → 3356.00] unto sanctification.
[3357.24 → 3357.74] This is the
[3357.74 → 3358.50] ongoing work
[3358.50 → 3359.80] of the Holy Spirit.
[3360.78 → 3360.96] Now,
[3361.88 → 3362.86] my own
[3362.86 → 3364.44] personal testimony
[3364.44 → 3365.88] is God
[3365.88 → 3366.54] overcoming
[3366.54 → 3367.14] some pretty
[3367.14 → 3368.08] serious sins
[3368.08 → 3369.20] in my life
[3369.20 → 3369.70] at different
[3369.70 → 3370.34] and significant
[3370.34 → 3370.96] points
[3370.96 → 3371.86] throughout it.
[3371.90 → 3372.28] And if you want
[3372.28 → 3372.84] to talk to me
[3372.84 → 3373.64] about that privately,
[3373.76 → 3374.44] I'm happy to share
[3374.44 → 3375.36] that story with you.
[3375.66 → 3376.42] The stage probably
[3376.42 → 3377.08] isn't the place
[3377.08 → 3378.36] for most of that.
[3379.06 → 3379.86] But the point
[3379.86 → 3380.80] that I want to make
[3380.80 → 3381.26] and the point
[3381.26 → 3382.26] that I hope you hear
[3382.26 → 3383.82] that based on
[3383.82 → 3384.68] the truth of
[3384.68 → 3385.38] God's own
[3385.38 → 3386.30] word to us
[3386.30 → 3387.30] and based on
[3387.30 → 3388.30] my own lived
[3388.30 → 3389.90] experience of it,
[3389.96 → 3390.56] I can say
[3390.56 → 3391.32] with confidence
[3391.32 → 3393.06] that he can do it.
[3394.14 → 3395.10] That he can
[3395.10 → 3396.18] transform you.
[3397.82 → 3398.46] And that he can
[3398.46 → 3398.86] overcome
[3398.86 → 3400.08] the sin
[3400.08 → 3400.80] and the darkness
[3400.80 → 3402.24] and the deep
[3402.24 → 3403.54] despair in your life.
[3403.62 → 3404.52] He can do it.
[3404.98 → 3406.26] And if he can do it
[3406.26 → 3407.16] and you are united
[3407.16 → 3407.72] to him,
[3407.92 → 3408.90] hear this very clearly,
[3408.90 → 3409.96] that means you
[3409.96 → 3410.62] can do it
[3410.62 → 3411.14] with him.
[3412.42 → 3413.44] That he can do it
[3413.44 → 3414.00] in you
[3414.00 → 3415.06] and for you
[3415.06 → 3415.92] with the power
[3415.92 → 3416.82] of the Holy Spirit.
[3417.08 → 3418.22] You are not left
[3418.22 → 3419.58] to your own devices.
[3420.12 → 3421.08] You are a device
[3421.08 → 3421.64] of God.
[3428.84 → 3430.24] This is what it means
[3430.24 → 3432.22] to have a spirit-filled
[3432.22 → 3433.40] life.
[3433.40 → 3438.68] Which brings me
[3438.68 → 3440.32] to the third point
[3440.32 → 3440.74] on the work
[3440.74 → 3441.50] of the Holy Spirit.
[3442.78 → 3444.16] Seeing all of this
[3444.16 → 3446.12] makes me
[3446.12 → 3446.96] want to
[3446.96 → 3447.46] worship
[3447.46 → 3448.90] Jesus.
[3450.04 → 3451.04] Seeing what he
[3451.04 → 3452.14] is able to do
[3452.14 → 3452.92] and what he
[3452.92 → 3453.80] has accomplished
[3453.80 → 3455.14] makes me want
[3455.14 → 3455.74] to sing
[3455.74 → 3456.92] his praises.
[3457.12 → 3457.74] And that too
[3457.74 → 3458.66] is the work
[3458.66 → 3459.72] of the Holy Spirit
[3459.72 → 3461.02] to make much
[3461.02 → 3462.14] of Jesus.
[3463.32 → 3464.22] Jesus himself
[3464.22 → 3465.46] says in John 15,
[3465.64 → 3466.36] 26,
[3466.48 → 3467.20] when the advocate
[3467.20 → 3467.74] comes,
[3467.86 → 3468.94] whom I will send
[3468.94 → 3470.00] you from the Father,
[3470.36 → 3471.48] the Spirit of truth
[3471.48 → 3472.12] who goes out
[3472.12 → 3472.78] from the Father,
[3472.94 → 3474.20] he will testify
[3474.20 → 3475.94] about me.
[3477.30 → 3478.04] The Holy Spirit's
[3478.04 → 3479.14] work is to
[3479.14 → 3480.36] testify about
[3480.36 → 3480.70] Jesus,
[3480.82 → 3481.96] to exalt him.
[3482.32 → 3483.08] Jesus continues
[3483.08 → 3483.88] in John 16,
[3484.20 → 3484.78] but when he,
[3484.94 → 3485.84] the Spirit of truth,
[3485.94 → 3486.22] comes,
[3486.34 → 3487.32] he will guide you
[3487.32 → 3488.58] into all truth.
[3489.30 → 3490.08] He will not speak
[3490.08 → 3490.70] on his own.
[3490.70 → 3491.24] He will speak
[3491.24 → 3492.12] only what he hears
[3492.12 → 3492.86] and he will tell you
[3492.86 → 3493.72] what is yet to come.
[3494.02 → 3495.76] He will glorify me
[3495.76 → 3497.00] because it is from me
[3497.00 → 3497.90] that he will receive
[3497.90 → 3498.84] what he will make
[3498.84 → 3499.60] known to you.
[3501.56 → 3503.18] Since the principal
[3503.18 → 3504.44] act and work
[3504.44 → 3505.64] of the Holy Spirit
[3505.64 → 3506.84] is to make union
[3506.84 → 3507.70] with Christ
[3507.70 → 3509.30] by faith possible,
[3509.58 → 3510.80] then the ultimate
[3510.80 → 3512.40] act of the Holy Spirit
[3512.40 → 3514.54] is to take those
[3514.54 → 3515.00] who are then
[3515.00 → 3516.32] united to Christ
[3516.32 → 3517.44] and to make them
[3517.44 → 3518.86] into worshippers
[3518.86 → 3518.98] the purpose
[3518.98 → 3520.48] of Christ.
[3522.02 → 3522.90] The Holy Spirit's
[3522.90 → 3523.78] role is to make
[3523.78 → 3524.90] much of Jesus
[3524.90 → 3526.10] in our midst
[3526.10 → 3526.92] and so the life
[3526.92 → 3527.64] of the believer
[3527.64 → 3528.98] filled with the Holy Spirit
[3528.98 → 3530.42] is to make much
[3530.42 → 3531.22] of Jesus
[3531.22 → 3532.80] in our midst.
[3535.40 → 3536.88] And so now we shift
[3536.88 → 3538.98] to the other side
[3538.98 → 3540.60] of the equation.
[3540.60 → 3543.96] the work of the Holy Spirit
[3543.96 → 3545.50] equals the mission
[3545.50 → 3546.52] of the church.
[3546.66 → 3547.58] I want to suggest
[3547.58 → 3548.96] to you that the mission
[3548.96 → 3550.30] of the church
[3550.30 → 3552.98] is worship.
[3554.98 → 3556.74] The church exists
[3556.74 → 3558.44] as the bride of Christ
[3558.44 → 3559.32] to exalt
[3559.32 → 3560.76] our bridegroom.
[3560.98 → 3562.18] The mission of the church
[3562.18 → 3563.64] is to worship.
[3563.64 → 3566.24] John Piper
[3566.24 → 3567.74] has said that
[3567.74 → 3568.44] missions
[3568.44 → 3569.54] exist
[3569.54 → 3570.64] where worship
[3570.64 → 3571.60] doesn't.
[3572.86 → 3573.76] I want you to notice
[3573.76 → 3574.00] there
[3574.00 → 3575.48] I've used two words
[3575.48 → 3576.30] the mission
[3576.30 → 3577.30] of the church
[3577.30 → 3579.06] is to worship God
[3579.06 → 3580.22] and missions
[3580.22 → 3581.86] exist
[3581.86 → 3583.46] where worship
[3583.46 → 3583.80] doesn't.
[3583.94 → 3584.34] Missions
[3584.34 → 3585.32] with an S
[3585.32 → 3586.18] is the act
[3586.18 → 3587.52] of going out
[3587.52 → 3587.84] right?
[3587.92 → 3588.58] It's the act
[3588.58 → 3590.18] of proclaiming
[3590.18 → 3590.82] the truth
[3590.82 → 3591.68] of the gospel
[3591.68 → 3592.88] into those places
[3592.88 → 3594.70] where it is not known.
[3595.32 → 3595.74] Missions
[3595.74 → 3596.66] that is the act
[3596.66 → 3597.12] of going
[3597.12 → 3598.06] the act of sending
[3598.06 → 3598.84] the act of
[3598.84 → 3600.36] being missionaries
[3600.36 → 3600.80] to which
[3600.80 → 3602.36] which is a vocation
[3602.36 → 3603.32] we are all called to.
[3603.58 → 3604.04] Missions
[3604.04 → 3606.96] is what we do
[3606.96 → 3608.18] because the mission
[3608.18 → 3609.66] of the church
[3609.66 → 3610.62] is to worship
[3610.62 → 3611.72] God.
[3613.22 → 3614.04] And in this
[3614.04 → 3614.70] the mission
[3614.70 → 3615.28] of the church
[3615.28 → 3616.78] then is to make
[3616.78 → 3617.86] worshippers
[3617.86 → 3619.06] where there is none.
[3620.00 → 3621.34] To make worshippers
[3621.34 → 3622.62] where there are few
[3622.62 → 3624.16] and to make deeper
[3624.16 → 3624.94] worshippers
[3624.94 → 3625.84] of us all.
[3627.14 → 3627.54] So again
[3627.54 → 3628.60] there are three things
[3628.60 → 3629.16] here.
[3629.28 → 3630.20] To make worshippers
[3630.20 → 3630.90] where there are none
[3630.90 → 3631.42] to make
[3631.42 → 3632.56] worshippers
[3632.56 → 3633.34] where there are few
[3633.34 → 3634.30] and to make deeper
[3634.30 → 3635.02] worshippers
[3635.02 → 3636.02] of us all.
[3636.10 → 3636.48] And again
[3636.48 → 3638.62] we're stacking
[3638.62 → 3639.74] these realities
[3639.74 → 3640.84] because both sides
[3640.84 → 3641.50] of the equation
[3641.50 → 3642.46] are equal
[3642.46 → 3643.20] and I believe
[3643.20 → 3643.94] this is true
[3643.94 → 3645.10] because as scripture
[3645.10 → 3645.62] says
[3645.62 → 3646.26] salvation
[3646.26 → 3647.36] and election
[3647.36 → 3648.32] happens
[3648.32 → 3649.84] for us
[3649.84 → 3651.14] our union
[3651.14 → 3651.98] with Christ
[3651.98 → 3652.76] occurs
[3652.76 → 3653.98] so that we
[3653.98 → 3654.82] as it says
[3654.82 → 3656.02] in Ephesians 1.12
[3656.02 → 3657.50] might be for the
[3657.50 → 3658.86] praise of his
[3658.86 → 3659.62] glory.
[3660.84 → 3661.70] Or as Peter
[3661.70 → 3663.08] says in 1 Peter 2.9
[3663.08 → 3663.72] that we might
[3663.72 → 3664.76] declare the praises
[3664.76 → 3665.26] of him
[3665.26 → 3666.48] who called us
[3666.48 → 3667.18] out of darkness
[3667.18 → 3668.12] into his
[3668.12 → 3668.94] wonderful light.
[3669.56 → 3670.18] Or Isaiah
[3670.18 → 3671.06] the greatest
[3671.06 → 3671.74] Old Testament
[3671.74 → 3672.40] prophet
[3672.40 → 3672.90] or one of the
[3672.90 → 3673.58] great Old Testament
[3673.58 → 3674.12] prophets
[3674.12 → 3675.26] foretells
[3675.26 → 3675.96] of a time
[3675.96 → 3676.68] when sons
[3676.68 → 3677.34] from afar
[3677.34 → 3677.92] and daughters
[3677.92 → 3678.56] from the ends
[3678.56 → 3679.02] of the earth
[3679.02 → 3679.80] everyone
[3679.80 → 3680.44] who's called
[3680.44 → 3681.22] by my name
[3681.22 → 3682.22] whom I created
[3682.22 → 3683.14] for my glory
[3683.14 → 3684.16] whom I formed
[3684.16 → 3684.62] and made.
[3684.68 → 3685.52] He tells us there
[3685.52 → 3686.50] that the goal
[3686.50 → 3687.80] of all of it
[3687.80 → 3689.34] is the glory
[3689.34 → 3690.00] of God
[3690.00 → 3691.00] of glorifying
[3691.00 → 3691.76] God
[3691.76 → 3692.20] and in fact
[3692.20 → 3693.16] in Isaiah 53
[3693.16 → 3694.56] further down
[3694.56 → 3695.08] he says
[3695.08 → 3696.06] that the reason
[3696.06 → 3697.40] God made people
[3697.40 → 3698.30] is so that we
[3698.30 → 3699.14] might proclaim
[3699.14 → 3700.22] his praise
[3700.22 → 3701.74] and this truth
[3701.74 → 3702.58] fits into the
[3702.58 → 3703.06] bigger theme
[3703.06 → 3703.54] of the Bible
[3703.54 → 3704.14] which runs
[3704.14 → 3705.06] from the very
[3705.06 → 3705.44] beginning
[3705.44 → 3706.06] to the very
[3706.06 → 3706.46] end
[3706.46 → 3707.38] which is
[3707.38 → 3708.10] summarized
[3708.10 → 3708.58] perfectly
[3708.58 → 3709.54] in Psalm 19
[3709.54 → 3710.76] that all
[3710.76 → 3711.46] creation
[3711.46 → 3712.92] is singing
[3712.92 → 3714.00] that right now
[3714.00 → 3714.64] the heavens
[3714.64 → 3715.34] are declaring
[3715.34 → 3715.90] the glory
[3715.90 → 3716.52] of God
[3716.52 → 3717.42] the skies
[3717.42 → 3717.98] proclaim
[3717.98 → 3718.46] the work
[3718.46 → 3719.12] of his hands
[3719.12 → 3720.96] Psalm 148
[3720.96 → 3721.76] Psalm 96
[3721.76 → 3722.58] all of these
[3722.58 → 3723.12] declare
[3723.12 → 3723.98] that all
[3723.98 → 3724.68] of creation
[3724.68 → 3725.44] exists
[3725.44 → 3726.94] to praise
[3726.94 → 3727.56] God
[3727.56 → 3728.12] to sing
[3728.12 → 3729.38] his praises
[3729.38 → 3729.92] and so
[3729.92 → 3730.72] the mission
[3730.72 → 3731.78] of the church
[3731.78 → 3733.42] is to make
[3733.42 → 3734.10] us worshippers
[3734.10 → 3735.92] is to make
[3735.92 → 3736.50] worshippers
[3736.50 → 3736.88] where there
[3736.88 → 3737.38] are none
[3737.38 → 3739.00] and that's
[3739.00 → 3739.38] why when
[3739.38 → 3739.72] Jesus
[3739.72 → 3741.40] says in
[3741.40 → 3742.16] Matthew 29
[3742.16 → 3743.06] therefore go
[3743.06 → 3743.86] and make
[3743.86 → 3744.32] disciples
[3744.32 → 3744.88] where does
[3744.88 → 3745.28] he sends
[3745.28 → 3745.48] them
[3745.48 → 3747.44] to all
[3747.44 → 3748.04] nations
[3748.04 → 3749.88] to those
[3749.88 → 3750.52] places where
[3750.52 → 3750.94] there are
[3750.94 → 3751.26] no
[3751.26 → 3752.06] worshippers
[3752.06 → 3752.48] that's why
[3752.48 → 3753.02] in Acts
[3753.02 → 3753.76] 1 verse
[3753.76 → 3754.08] 8
[3754.08 → 3754.58] right
[3754.58 → 3754.90] Jesus
[3754.90 → 3755.56] says to
[3755.56 → 3755.72] his
[3755.72 → 3756.14] disciples
[3756.14 → 3756.50] before
[3756.50 → 3756.86] he is
[3756.86 → 3757.30] ascended
[3757.30 → 3757.94] you will
[3757.94 → 3758.26] be my
[3758.26 → 3758.64] witnesses
[3758.64 → 3759.38] in Jerusalem
[3759.38 → 3759.80] and in
[3759.80 → 3760.18] Judea
[3760.18 → 3760.58] and all
[3760.58 → 3761.06] Samaria
[3761.06 → 3762.02] and to
[3762.02 → 3762.78] the ends
[3762.78 → 3763.36] of the
[3763.36 → 3763.76] earth
[3763.76 → 3765.56] right
[3765.56 → 3765.72] we don't
[3765.72 → 3766.04] have time
[3766.04 → 3766.30] to go
[3766.30 → 3766.48] through
[3766.48 → 3767.12] every instance
[3767.12 → 3767.40] in the
[3767.40 → 3767.70] bible
[3767.70 → 3768.24] and so
[3768.24 → 3768.48] maybe
[3768.48 → 3768.84] you can
[3768.84 → 3769.22] trust me
[3769.22 → 3769.54] on this
[3769.54 → 3769.78] but if
[3769.78 → 3770.00] you want
[3770.00 → 3770.28] to wrestle
[3770.28 → 3770.60] with it
[3770.60 → 3770.92] then let's
[3770.92 → 3771.24] do it
[3771.24 → 3771.76] but from
[3771.76 → 3772.20] the very
[3772.20 → 3772.62] beginning
[3772.62 → 3772.96] right
[3772.96 → 3773.42] God's
[3773.42 → 3774.00] purpose
[3774.00 → 3774.78] was to
[3774.78 → 3775.32] make sure
[3775.32 → 3775.82] that all
[3775.82 → 3776.28] people
[3776.28 → 3777.20] everywhere
[3777.20 → 3777.88] people from
[3777.88 → 3778.66] every tribe
[3778.66 → 3779.28] tongue
[3779.28 → 3780.08] and nation
[3780.08 → 3780.98] might
[3780.98 → 3781.86] worship
[3781.86 → 3782.50] him
[3782.50 → 3782.90] we might
[3782.90 → 3783.12] have
[3783.12 → 3783.92] worshippers
[3783.92 → 3784.58] from all
[3784.58 → 3785.20] over
[3785.20 → 3786.10] creation
[3786.10 → 3786.90] through all
[3786.90 → 3787.66] of time
[3787.66 → 3788.40] and history
[3788.40 → 3790.10] the mission
[3790.10 → 3790.42] of the
[3790.42 → 3790.74] church
[3790.74 → 3791.64] by proclaiming
[3791.64 → 3792.14] the gospel
[3792.14 → 3793.08] and inviting
[3793.08 → 3793.74] people into
[3793.74 → 3794.50] union with
[3794.50 → 3794.88] Christ
[3794.88 → 3795.32] through the
[3795.32 → 3795.60] work of
[3795.60 → 3795.88] the Holy
[3795.88 → 3796.18] Spirit
[3796.18 → 3797.02] is to
[3797.02 → 3797.42] make
[3797.42 → 3798.52] worshippers
[3798.52 → 3799.12] is to
[3799.12 → 3799.58] join
[3799.58 → 3800.28] with the
[3800.28 → 3800.84] Holy Spirit
[3800.84 → 3801.40] in making
[3801.40 → 3801.88] much
[3801.88 → 3802.66] of
[3802.66 → 3803.36] Jesus
[3803.36 → 3806.14] and this
[3806.14 → 3806.68] continues
[3806.68 → 3808.10] in the
[3808.10 → 3808.42] mission of
[3808.42 → 3809.00] the church
[3809.00 → 3810.46] being to
[3810.46 → 3810.78] make
[3810.78 → 3811.70] worshippers
[3811.70 → 3812.24] where there
[3812.24 → 3812.82] are few
[3812.82 → 3814.58] and immediately
[3814.58 → 3815.16] after the
[3815.16 → 3816.22] text that
[3816.22 → 3816.68] we read
[3816.68 → 3818.32] in Acts
[3818.32 → 3818.98] chapter 2
[3818.98 → 3819.82] verse 42
[3819.82 → 3820.38] and then in
[3820.38 → 3820.88] 47
[3820.88 → 3822.46] we read
[3822.46 → 3823.14] they devoted
[3823.14 → 3823.98] themselves to
[3823.98 → 3824.50] the apostles
[3824.50 → 3825.36] teaching and
[3825.36 → 3825.88] to fellowship
[3825.88 → 3826.40] and to the
[3826.40 → 3826.88] breaking of
[3826.88 → 3827.42] bread and
[3827.42 → 3827.90] to prayer
[3827.90 → 3828.36] and then at
[3828.36 → 3828.66] the end
[3828.66 → 3828.94] there in
[3828.94 → 3829.58] verse 47
[3829.58 → 3829.96] and the
[3829.96 → 3830.76] Lord added
[3830.76 → 3831.22] to their
[3831.22 → 3831.54] number
[3831.54 → 3832.14] daily
[3832.14 → 3833.18] those who
[3833.18 → 3833.58] were being
[3833.58 → 3834.08] saved
[3834.08 → 3835.94] did you
[3835.94 → 3836.40] notice
[3836.40 → 3837.66] right
[3837.66 → 3838.20] it's in
[3838.20 → 3838.86] the ordinary
[3838.86 → 3839.66] means
[3839.66 → 3840.38] in the
[3840.38 → 3840.86] regular
[3840.86 → 3841.68] movement
[3841.68 → 3842.08] of the
[3842.08 → 3842.40] life
[3842.40 → 3842.74] and the
[3842.74 → 3843.02] work
[3843.02 → 3843.36] of the
[3843.36 → 3843.76] church
[3843.76 → 3844.10] that the
[3844.10 → 3844.72] Holy Spirit
[3844.72 → 3845.64] has already
[3845.64 → 3846.24] used to
[3846.24 → 3847.02] create union
[3847.02 → 3847.70] with Christ
[3847.70 → 3848.26] that he
[3848.26 → 3848.96] now uses
[3848.96 → 3849.84] to grow
[3849.84 → 3850.96] the church
[3850.96 → 3852.36] right
[3852.36 → 3853.04] to include
[3853.04 → 3853.62] others
[3853.62 → 3854.62] into that
[3854.62 → 3855.44] union
[3855.44 → 3857.28] to join
[3857.28 → 3857.88] with him
[3857.88 → 3859.28] the Lord
[3859.28 → 3860.24] added to
[3860.24 → 3860.82] their number
[3860.82 → 3861.60] daily
[3861.60 → 3862.08] and so
[3862.08 → 3862.58] you don't
[3862.58 → 3863.16] need flashy
[3863.16 → 3863.76] strategies
[3863.76 → 3864.40] or smoke
[3864.40 → 3864.80] machines
[3864.80 → 3865.18] you don't
[3865.18 → 3865.92] need light
[3865.92 → 3866.38] shows
[3866.38 → 3866.80] right
[3866.80 → 3867.14] you don't
[3867.14 → 3867.66] need social
[3867.66 → 3868.02] media
[3868.02 → 3868.74] campaigns
[3868.74 → 3869.22] right
[3869.22 → 3869.52] you don't
[3869.52 → 3870.02] need any
[3870.02 → 3870.40] of those
[3870.40 → 3870.58] things
[3870.58 → 3870.80] and I'm
[3870.80 → 3872.10] not denying
[3872.10 → 3872.54] that those
[3872.54 → 3872.98] things might
[3872.98 → 3873.34] have some
[3873.34 → 3873.70] effect
[3873.70 → 3874.12] and maybe
[3874.12 → 3874.48] in your
[3874.48 → 3874.88] context
[3874.88 → 3875.38] those things
[3875.38 → 3876.18] are a little
[3876.18 → 3877.32] bit important
[3877.32 → 3877.72] but they're
[3877.72 → 3878.10] not as
[3878.10 → 3878.46] important
[3878.46 → 3879.00] as you
[3879.00 → 3879.44] might
[3879.44 → 3880.00] think
[3880.00 → 3881.46] right
[3881.46 → 3881.78] whatever
[3881.78 → 3882.48] comes next
[3882.48 → 3882.78] in the
[3882.78 → 3883.00] church
[3883.00 → 3883.36] growth
[3883.36 → 3883.80] movement
[3883.80 → 3885.00] I hope
[3885.00 → 3885.54] it is a
[3885.54 → 3885.96] devotion
[3885.96 → 3886.38] to the
[3886.38 → 3886.64] teaching
[3886.64 → 3886.88] of the
[3886.88 → 3887.28] apostles
[3887.28 → 3889.32] and I
[3889.32 → 3889.56] hope
[3889.56 → 3890.00] it's a
[3890.00 → 3890.66] commitment
[3890.66 → 3891.12] to the
[3891.12 → 3891.54] fellowship
[3891.54 → 3891.88] and to
[3891.88 → 3892.26] the breaking
[3892.26 → 3892.82] of bread
[3892.82 → 3893.42] and to
[3893.42 → 3893.74] prayer
[3893.74 → 3894.82] because that's
[3894.82 → 3895.06] how the
[3895.06 → 3895.60] Holy Spirit
[3895.60 → 3896.16] works
[3896.16 → 3897.64] right
[3897.64 → 3898.12] that's
[3898.12 → 3898.56] what the
[3898.56 → 3898.88] mission
[3898.88 → 3899.24] of the
[3899.24 → 3899.66] church
[3899.66 → 3900.28] ought to
[3900.28 → 3901.22] look like
[3901.22 → 3904.16] and then
[3904.16 → 3904.58] lastly
[3904.58 → 3905.74] the mission
[3905.74 → 3905.96] of the
[3905.96 → 3906.38] church
[3906.38 → 3907.42] ought to
[3907.42 → 3908.78] make deeper
[3908.78 → 3909.62] worshippers
[3909.62 → 3910.42] of us
[3910.42 → 3910.86] all
[3910.86 → 3915.38] in
[3915.38 → 3915.82] Ephesians
[3915.82 → 3916.24] 4
[3916.24 → 3917.96] Paul
[3917.96 → 3920.64] builds
[3920.64 → 3921.22] on his
[3921.22 → 3921.66] call
[3921.66 → 3922.70] the call
[3922.70 → 3923.06] that was
[3923.06 → 3924.12] first spoken
[3924.12 → 3925.90] in Acts
[3925.90 → 3926.30] 2
[3926.30 → 3927.00] to repent
[3927.00 → 3927.62] and be
[3927.62 → 3928.16] baptized
[3928.16 → 3928.84] every one
[3928.84 → 3929.10] of you
[3929.10 → 3929.34] in the
[3929.34 → 3929.70] name of
[3929.70 → 3929.90] Jesus
[3929.90 → 3930.28] Christ
[3930.28 → 3930.58] for the
[3930.58 → 3930.86] forgiveness
[3930.86 → 3931.26] of your
[3931.26 → 3931.54] sins
[3931.54 → 3932.24] and you
[3932.24 → 3932.84] will receive
[3932.84 → 3933.36] the gift
[3933.36 → 3933.94] of the
[3933.94 → 3934.48] Holy Spirit
[3934.48 → 3935.00] the promise
[3935.00 → 3935.72] is for you
[3935.72 → 3936.68] and for your
[3936.68 → 3937.14] children
[3937.14 → 3937.62] for the
[3937.62 → 3938.82] next generation
[3938.82 → 3940.00] to grow
[3940.00 → 3940.74] into this
[3940.74 → 3941.02] reality
[3941.02 → 3941.58] for all
[3941.58 → 3941.96] who are
[3941.96 → 3942.56] far off
[3942.56 → 3943.06] for all
[3943.06 → 3943.50] whom the
[3943.50 → 3943.80] Lord
[3943.80 → 3944.70] our God
[3944.70 → 3945.56] will call
[3945.56 → 3947.68] Paul
[3947.68 → 3948.46] expands on
[3948.46 → 3948.88] this in
[3948.88 → 3949.44] Ephesians
[3949.44 → 3950.70] when he
[3950.70 → 3951.26] says that
[3951.26 → 3951.96] Christ
[3951.96 → 3952.78] himself
[3952.78 → 3954.02] gave the
[3954.02 → 3954.48] apostles
[3954.48 → 3954.90] and the
[3954.90 → 3955.26] prophets
[3955.26 → 3956.06] the evangelists
[3956.06 → 3956.54] the pastors
[3956.54 → 3956.86] and the
[3956.86 → 3957.18] teachers
[3957.18 → 3958.50] to equip
[3958.50 → 3959.38] his people
[3959.38 → 3960.02] for works
[3960.02 → 3960.50] of service
[3960.50 → 3960.84] that the
[3960.84 → 3961.16] body
[3961.16 → 3961.62] may be
[3961.62 → 3961.88] built
[3961.88 → 3962.30] up
[3962.30 → 3963.26] right
[3963.26 → 3963.48] then he
[3963.48 → 3963.88] goes on
[3963.88 → 3964.12] he says
[3964.12 → 3964.74] by becoming
[3964.74 → 3965.36] mature
[3965.36 → 3966.20] attaining
[3966.20 → 3966.62] to the
[3966.62 → 3967.06] whole
[3967.06 → 3967.64] measure
[3967.64 → 3968.10] of the
[3968.10 → 3968.42] fullness
[3968.42 → 3969.04] of Christ
[3969.04 → 3969.94] no longer
[3969.94 → 3970.46] infants
[3970.46 → 3971.08] but growing
[3971.08 → 3971.84] in every
[3971.84 → 3972.28] respect
[3972.28 → 3972.76] to become
[3972.76 → 3973.30] the mature
[3973.30 → 3975.32] body
[3975.32 → 3975.92] of him
[3975.92 → 3976.68] who is
[3976.68 → 3977.42] the head
[3977.42 → 3980.08] and if I
[3980.08 → 3980.76] can be bold
[3980.76 → 3981.20] with you
[3981.20 → 3981.56] one more
[3981.56 → 3982.06] time
[3982.06 → 3983.74] too many
[3983.74 → 3984.42] of us
[3984.42 → 3986.38] have
[3986.38 → 3986.78] willingly
[3986.78 → 3987.32] remained
[3987.32 → 3988.04] infants
[3988.04 → 3989.80] in our
[3989.80 → 3990.10] faith
[3990.10 → 3992.34] too many
[3992.34 → 3992.92] of us
[3992.92 → 3993.40] have
[3993.40 → 3994.04] gotten
[3994.04 → 3994.44] used
[3994.44 → 3995.18] to a
[3995.18 → 3995.42] diet
[3995.42 → 3995.80] of
[3995.80 → 3996.30] milk
[3996.30 → 3996.74] and have
[3996.74 → 3997.80] not grown
[3997.80 → 3998.14] in the
[3998.14 → 3998.52] power
[3998.52 → 3999.12] of the
[3999.12 → 3999.42] spirit
[3999.42 → 4000.36] not testing
[4000.36 → 4000.76] him
[4000.76 → 4001.66] in what
[4001.66 → 4002.06] he has
[4002.06 → 4002.48] called
[4002.48 → 4002.88] us to
[4002.88 → 4003.14] and in
[4003.14 → 4003.68] the power
[4003.68 → 4004.24] that he
[4004.24 → 4004.78] has granted
[4004.78 → 4005.20] us to
[4005.20 → 4005.94] live
[4005.94 → 4006.56] victorious
[4006.56 → 4007.40] over sin
[4007.40 → 4008.48] and struggles
[4008.48 → 4009.68] and Paul
[4009.68 → 4010.10] actually
[4010.10 → 4010.94] in Ephesians
[4010.94 → 4011.60] he builds
[4011.60 → 4012.14] on this
[4012.14 → 4012.62] and he gives
[4012.62 → 4013.16] a list
[4013.16 → 4013.70] of ways
[4013.70 → 4014.14] to be
[4014.14 → 4014.56] in the
[4014.56 → 4014.82] world
[4014.82 → 4015.50] to not
[4015.50 → 4015.86] live
[4015.86 → 4016.26] like the
[4016.26 → 4016.64] rest of
[4016.64 → 4017.00] the world
[4017.00 → 4017.64] to put
[4017.64 → 4018.06] on the
[4018.06 → 4018.58] new self
[4018.58 → 4018.88] that is
[4018.88 → 4019.98] created
[4019.98 → 4020.58] to be
[4020.58 → 4021.16] like God
[4021.16 → 4021.66] in true
[4021.66 → 4022.22] righteousness
[4022.22 → 4023.22] and holiness
[4023.22 → 4023.68] we are
[4023.68 → 4024.00] called
[4024.00 → 4024.44] to put
[4024.44 → 4024.96] off the
[4024.96 → 4025.30] deeds
[4025.30 → 4025.92] of darkness
[4025.92 → 4026.40] and to
[4026.40 → 4026.70] live
[4026.70 → 4027.52] as children
[4027.52 → 4027.84] of the
[4027.84 → 4028.04] light
[4028.04 → 4028.66] and then
[4028.66 → 4028.98] this is
[4028.98 → 4029.20] what he
[4029.20 → 4029.44] says
[4029.44 → 4029.84] this is
[4029.84 → 4030.28] I think
[4030.28 → 4030.72] a beautiful
[4030.72 → 4031.04] way
[4031.04 → 4032.26] to circle
[4032.26 → 4032.82] all of
[4032.82 → 4033.30] these things
[4033.30 → 4033.68] together
[4033.68 → 4034.20] he says
[4034.20 → 4034.66] we are
[4034.66 → 4035.00] to be
[4035.00 → 4035.62] so full
[4035.62 → 4035.96] of the
[4035.96 → 4036.50] Holy Spirit
[4036.50 → 4037.08] that we
[4037.08 → 4037.54] speak
[4037.54 → 4037.86] to one
[4037.86 → 4038.08] another
[4038.08 → 4038.84] in psalms
[4038.84 → 4039.38] and in
[4039.38 → 4039.78] hymns
[4039.78 → 4040.12] and in
[4040.12 → 4040.46] songs
[4040.46 → 4040.86] from the
[4040.86 → 4041.08] Spirit
[4041.08 → 4042.18] calling us
[4042.18 → 4042.66] Paul does
[4042.66 → 4042.92] in those
[4042.92 → 4043.20] moments
[4043.20 → 4043.82] to sing
[4043.82 → 4044.36] and to
[4044.36 → 4045.04] make music
[4045.04 → 4045.66] from your
[4045.66 → 4046.14] heart
[4046.14 → 4046.78] to the
[4046.78 → 4047.10] Lord
[4047.10 → 4049.96] the Holy
[4049.96 → 4050.42] Spirit
[4050.42 → 4050.84] the work
[4050.84 → 4051.10] of the
[4051.10 → 4051.72] Holy Spirit
[4051.72 → 4052.48] and the
[4052.48 → 4052.76] mission
[4052.76 → 4053.08] of the
[4053.08 → 4053.44] church
[4053.44 → 4055.66] is to
[4055.66 → 4056.26] make us
[4056.26 → 4057.56] into
[4057.56 → 4058.44] deeper
[4058.44 → 4059.86] and deeper
[4059.86 → 4061.12] worshippers
[4061.12 → 4062.54] of God
[4062.54 → 4064.46] the
[4064.46 → 4064.70] mission
[4064.70 → 4064.94] of the
[4064.94 → 4065.18] church
[4065.18 → 4065.56] is to
[4065.56 → 4065.72] make
[4065.72 → 4066.24] worshippers
[4066.24 → 4066.60] where there
[4066.60 → 4067.08] is none
[4067.08 → 4067.66] to make
[4067.66 → 4068.12] worshippers
[4068.12 → 4068.44] where there
[4068.44 → 4068.92] are few
[4068.92 → 4069.46] and to
[4069.46 → 4069.94] make deeper
[4069.94 → 4070.52] worshippers
[4070.52 → 4071.22] of us
[4071.22 → 4071.44] all
[4071.44 → 4071.74] and the
[4071.74 → 4072.46] Holy Spirit
[4072.46 → 4073.34] works to
[4073.34 → 4073.88] make union
[4073.88 → 4074.40] with Jesus
[4074.40 → 4074.96] possible
[4074.96 → 4075.54] through faith
[4075.54 → 4075.84] and to
[4075.84 → 4076.64] grow the
[4076.64 → 4077.04] faith of
[4077.04 → 4077.40] those who
[4077.40 → 4077.68] already
[4077.68 → 4078.04] believe
[4078.04 → 4078.76] in order
[4078.76 → 4079.18] that
[4079.18 → 4080.70] he might
[4080.70 → 4081.58] make much
[4081.58 → 4081.98] of the
[4081.98 → 4082.42] person
[4082.42 → 4083.28] and work
[4083.28 → 4083.90] of Jesus
[4083.90 → 4084.82] in us
[4084.82 → 4085.46] and through
[4085.46 → 4085.90] us
[4085.90 → 4087.30] the mission
[4087.30 → 4087.64] of the
[4087.64 → 4087.98] church
[4087.98 → 4089.16] is the
[4089.16 → 4089.62] work of
[4089.62 → 4090.00] the Holy
[4090.00 → 4090.44] Spirit
[4090.44 → 4092.34] and so
[4092.34 → 4093.08] if ever
[4093.08 → 4094.58] if ever
[4094.58 → 4095.12] there was
[4095.12 → 4095.94] a day
[4095.94 → 4096.48] and a
[4096.48 → 4096.80] moment
[4096.80 → 4097.38] for you
[4097.38 → 4098.08] to leave
[4098.08 → 4098.80] this place
[4098.80 → 4099.80] confident
[4099.80 → 4100.62] in the
[4100.62 → 4100.90] Lord
[4100.90 → 4101.50] this is
[4101.50 → 4101.98] that day

[4560.98 → 4565.44] Because that's what's happening here
[4565.44 → 4571.60] Go with the blessing of God

[4580.54 → 4583.02] God, go beneath you to support you
[4583.02 → 4586.16] And God, go beside you to befriend you
[4586.16 → 4588.74] Do not be afraid
[4588.74 → 4591.18] Let the blessing of God come upon you today
[4591.18 → 4592.70] Do not be afraid
[4592.70 → 4595.10] But go in peace
