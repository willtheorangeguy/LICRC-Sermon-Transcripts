[2909.68 --> 2939.66]  Good morning.
[2939.68 --> 2969.68]  Thank you.
[2969.68 --> 2999.68]  Thank you.
[2999.68 --> 3029.68]  Thank you.

[3059.68 --> 3089.68]  Thank you.
[3089.68 --> 3119.68]  Thank you.
[3119.68 --> 3149.66]  Thank you.
[3149.68 --> 3179.68]  This text.
[3179.68 --> 3209.68]  Thank you.
[3209.68 --> 3239.68]  Thank you.
[3239.68 --> 3269.68]  Thank you.
[3269.68 --> 3299.68]  Thank you.
[3299.68 --> 3300.68]  Thank you.
[3329.68 --> 3359.68]  Thank you.
[3359.68 --> 3361.64]  They needed rescuing from their captors.
[3363.08 --> 3365.08]  But more importantly than that,
[3366.02 --> 3367.80]  they needed rescuing from themselves.
[3369.40 --> 3371.72]  They were sinful and arrogant,
[3372.08 --> 3373.86]  and they had forgotten about God.
[3374.18 --> 3377.36]  So Babylon came knocking, just as God said they would.
[3379.14 --> 3382.34]  They were comfortable doing things their own way.
[3383.22 --> 3384.78]  They were not doing things God ways.
[3384.78 --> 3386.20]  Look at their history.
[3386.34 --> 3387.90]  They had put their trust and comfort
[3387.90 --> 3392.00]  in the kings of other nations instead of God.
[3392.10 --> 3395.96]  You see that in 2 Kings 16, verses 7 to 18.
[3396.62 --> 3399.62]  They had built pagan altars and had worshipped Baal.
[3399.92 --> 3401.30]  They had broke the Sabbath,
[3401.66 --> 3405.08]  and they sought wealth over obedience.
[3406.20 --> 3409.20]  They had refused to listen to God's people,
[3409.64 --> 3410.32]  God's prophets.
[3410.32 --> 3414.34]  And they'd never abandoned their idolatry.
[3415.80 --> 3417.44]  So because of their sin,
[3417.90 --> 3420.76]  because they had put their hope in other nations,
[3421.02 --> 3423.12]  in other gods, in other comforts,
[3423.12 --> 3426.82]  they ultimately ended up in a foreign land
[3426.82 --> 3428.38]  under foreign rule.
[3431.62 --> 3433.94]  They needed saving from themselves.
[3435.28 --> 3437.30]  And so God brought them to exile.
[3439.30 --> 3440.54]  God discomforted them.
[3440.54 --> 3444.32]  See, God had not forgotten his people
[3444.32 --> 3446.18]  when they were overtaken by the Babylonians.
[3446.26 --> 3448.56]  He wanted to draw them closer to him,
[3448.86 --> 3449.48]  and they needed,
[3449.92 --> 3452.60]  God needed their comforts reoriented.
[3454.24 --> 3456.46]  They were finding their comfort in false gods
[3456.46 --> 3457.44]  and pagan ways,
[3457.50 --> 3460.10]  and what God promised would happen came to fruition.
[3460.48 --> 3461.12]  They were captured.
[3461.82 --> 3463.22]  They were brought out of their land.
[3463.28 --> 3465.88]  They were removed from their comforts.
[3465.88 --> 3470.14]  That was their context.
[3470.26 --> 3471.64]  That was their situation.
[3473.26 --> 3474.38]  So then what about us?
[3474.44 --> 3475.28]  What about ours?
[3476.62 --> 3477.72]  See, we're not Judah.
[3478.52 --> 3479.86]  We're not in exile.
[3480.06 --> 3483.34]  We cannot sort of draw these straight parallel lines
[3483.34 --> 3484.78]  between what's happening there
[3484.78 --> 3485.92]  and what's happening here.
[3486.10 --> 3487.92]  We cannot claim that our own suffering
[3487.92 --> 3489.68]  is kind of our own exile.
[3489.68 --> 3492.26]  That's a little bit too irresponsible, I think,
[3492.30 --> 3492.68]  with this passage.
[3493.64 --> 3496.98]  But we do hurt, don't we?
[3499.08 --> 3500.02]  We do hurt.
[3500.22 --> 3501.92]  There's a lot of pain in our world.
[3503.86 --> 3505.20]  And like the Israelites
[3505.20 --> 3508.64]  who looked to the world to comfort them,
[3508.70 --> 3511.18]  to things like idols and kings and wealth,
[3511.96 --> 3513.62]  I think we too
[3513.62 --> 3517.48]  often seek comfort in the things of this world,
[3517.48 --> 3520.80]  things that draw us perhaps away from God.
[3522.88 --> 3524.26]  So where do we seek comfort?
[3525.84 --> 3528.24]  Or how do we need our own comforts reoriented?
[3530.20 --> 3531.68]  The world is a heavy place,
[3531.80 --> 3533.56]  and I know we feel the burden of life.
[3533.98 --> 3534.74]  School is hard.
[3534.84 --> 3537.22]  There's students returning from university right now.
[3537.28 --> 3538.86]  They're in the middle of exams, some of them.
[3538.94 --> 3539.78]  School is difficult.
[3541.34 --> 3542.68]  Relationships can be strained.
[3543.56 --> 3544.86]  We know that too well.
[3544.86 --> 3546.06]  Work is demanding.
[3547.48 --> 3548.56]  Health can be fleeting.
[3550.24 --> 3552.28]  Our loved ones struggle with pain
[3552.28 --> 3554.40]  and suffering and health themselves,
[3554.90 --> 3556.08]  and we bear that.
[3557.36 --> 3559.16]  I know many of us are in places
[3559.16 --> 3560.12]  that are very difficult.
[3561.56 --> 3563.06]  We just listen to a prayer.
[3563.14 --> 3564.20]  We just heard some announcements.
[3565.14 --> 3566.32]  We read the bulletin.
[3566.38 --> 3567.60]  We know life is challenging.
[3567.80 --> 3568.74]  Pain is present.
[3570.02 --> 3571.62]  Life is hard.
[3571.62 --> 3576.12]  But where do we turn for comfort?
[3577.48 --> 3582.00]  One of my struggles, if I can be honest,
[3582.28 --> 3584.30]  is the old cell phone.
[3586.22 --> 3587.54]  If I've had a long day,
[3587.86 --> 3590.06]  or if I'm feeling a little overwhelmed in life,
[3590.12 --> 3590.82]  at the end of the day,
[3590.88 --> 3591.70]  I'll sit down,
[3591.76 --> 3594.30]  and I've been known to sort of doom scroll for a while.
[3595.10 --> 3596.38]  For a period of time,
[3596.38 --> 3597.82]  I care not to admit out loud.
[3598.72 --> 3600.60]  For those of you who don't know what doom scrolling is,
[3600.64 --> 3601.46]  it's when you tell yourself
[3601.46 --> 3602.84]  you're just going to check the social media
[3602.84 --> 3603.72]  for a minute or two,
[3603.80 --> 3605.08]  and then two hours later,
[3605.16 --> 3607.34]  you're knee deep in catastrophic headlines
[3607.34 --> 3608.44]  and existential dread.
[3609.44 --> 3612.32]  And there's the odd clip of a British panel show
[3612.32 --> 3613.44]  somewhere thrown in there too,
[3613.50 --> 3613.96]  for good measure.
[3614.28 --> 3616.44]  It's like a little hit of dopamine light,
[3616.72 --> 3616.96]  you know?
[3616.96 --> 3619.48]  You know you should stop,
[3619.54 --> 3620.90]  but you just kind of keep going.
[3620.98 --> 3621.92]  It's like poking a bruise.
[3621.98 --> 3622.64]  Like it hurts a little,
[3622.74 --> 3623.74]  but you just kind of keep doing it.
[3625.12 --> 3626.20]  The problem is,
[3627.04 --> 3628.18]  there's always a new meme.
[3628.50 --> 3629.68]  There's always a new reel.
[3629.82 --> 3631.52]  There's another video to watch.
[3631.96 --> 3633.42]  There's clickbait articles
[3633.42 --> 3634.64]  and political opinions
[3634.64 --> 3636.54]  and the latest on the Edmonton Oilers
[3636.54 --> 3637.68]  that you need to keep up on.
[3638.00 --> 3639.62]  There's celebrity news
[3639.62 --> 3642.28]  and clips from your favorite TV shows.
[3642.46 --> 3642.96]  And to be honest,
[3643.02 --> 3644.36]  it's mostly just dumb people
[3644.36 --> 3645.84]  doing things that are rather humorous.
[3645.84 --> 3648.02]  In many ways,
[3648.96 --> 3650.82]  most of it's fairly harmless
[3650.82 --> 3651.92]  in and of itself.
[3653.28 --> 3655.48]  But as I prepared this message,
[3655.56 --> 3658.46]  I realized how much of my doom scrolling
[3658.46 --> 3661.44]  is actually me seeking comfort
[3661.44 --> 3665.16]  by turning to the curated perfection
[3665.16 --> 3666.52]  of other people's lives
[3666.52 --> 3669.22]  or by turning to a quick joke
[3669.22 --> 3670.32]  or a funny post
[3670.32 --> 3672.20]  or turning to an opinion
[3672.20 --> 3673.54]  that I already have
[3673.54 --> 3675.48]  because that's how these algorithms work.
[3675.84 --> 3678.76]  So this forced me to ask,
[3678.90 --> 3680.74]  how much of this is me just escaping
[3680.74 --> 3682.32]  into a different world
[3682.32 --> 3683.74]  fueled by a dopamine rush
[3683.74 --> 3684.56]  of instant content?
[3685.20 --> 3687.68]  Perhaps comfort is what I desire
[3687.68 --> 3688.56]  when I do that.
[3688.92 --> 3690.20]  But all I really get
[3690.20 --> 3693.10]  is a jolt of instant gratification
[3693.10 --> 3695.06]  that just withers away like the grass.
[3695.06 --> 3698.34]  So where do you turn?
[3699.08 --> 3700.18]  There's a lot of places
[3700.18 --> 3701.78]  people turn for comfort in our world.
[3702.14 --> 3702.86]  Maybe it's a bottle
[3702.86 --> 3703.98]  from that special cabinet.
[3704.74 --> 3706.08]  Maybe it's McDonald's.
[3706.46 --> 3708.00]  Maybe it's a little retail therapy.
[3708.96 --> 3710.42]  Maybe it's even back to the workplace.
[3711.12 --> 3712.62]  Or maybe it's withdrawing
[3712.62 --> 3713.68]  from the world altogether.
[3715.58 --> 3716.18]  Now again,
[3716.46 --> 3717.34]  if you think about it,
[3717.38 --> 3718.80]  none of those are inherently bad
[3718.80 --> 3719.64]  in and of themselves.
[3719.64 --> 3721.20]  But if we try to find
[3721.20 --> 3722.04]  our comfort there
[3722.04 --> 3723.30]  over and over again,
[3723.62 --> 3724.68]  at best,
[3725.28 --> 3726.60]  we become zombies.
[3727.20 --> 3728.10]  And at worst,
[3728.56 --> 3730.40]  we start worshiping an idol
[3730.40 --> 3731.96]  far more destructive
[3731.96 --> 3732.76]  than we realize.
[3735.58 --> 3736.92]  When life is hard
[3736.92 --> 3738.30]  or when we feel the weight
[3738.30 --> 3740.14]  of adversity on our shoulders,
[3740.28 --> 3741.22]  where do we turn
[3741.22 --> 3742.38]  for comfort?
[3742.38 --> 3742.46]  comfort.
[3745.66 --> 3747.04]  This theme actually links
[3747.04 --> 3748.52]  to our previous sermon series,
[3748.64 --> 3749.20]  if you recall.
[3749.38 --> 3750.08]  Before Advent,
[3750.28 --> 3751.36]  we were making our way
[3751.36 --> 3752.56]  through the story of Joseph
[3752.56 --> 3753.62]  in the Old Testament
[3753.62 --> 3754.28]  and we were hearing
[3754.28 --> 3755.60]  about God's sovereignty
[3755.60 --> 3756.58]  and our suffering.
[3757.78 --> 3758.76]  We learned about
[3758.76 --> 3760.98]  how God used Joseph's adversity
[3760.98 --> 3762.78]  to bless his family
[3762.78 --> 3763.84]  and the surrounding nations.
[3763.96 --> 3765.44]  See, in Joseph's story
[3765.44 --> 3766.34]  in Genesis 50,
[3766.46 --> 3767.56]  after being sold
[3767.56 --> 3768.42]  by his brothers
[3768.42 --> 3769.22]  into captivity,
[3769.50 --> 3770.26]  after being shipped
[3770.26 --> 3771.10]  to Egypt,
[3771.42 --> 3772.18]  being enslaved,
[3772.18 --> 3773.52]  being accused of a crime
[3773.52 --> 3774.32]  he didn't commit,
[3774.68 --> 3775.62]  being put in jail,
[3775.68 --> 3776.26]  and eventually,
[3777.14 --> 3778.20]  at the end of this story,
[3778.26 --> 3779.08]  becoming one of the
[3779.08 --> 3780.36]  key prominent rulers
[3780.36 --> 3781.62]  that saves Egypt
[3781.62 --> 3782.52]  and the surrounding nations
[3782.52 --> 3783.24]  from famine,
[3784.16 --> 3785.46]  Joseph meets his brothers
[3785.46 --> 3786.38]  who sold him
[3786.38 --> 3787.28]  in the first place
[3787.28 --> 3789.34]  and he says to them,
[3789.46 --> 3791.00]  what you planned for evil,
[3791.84 --> 3793.18]  God used for good.
[3794.40 --> 3795.76]  That whole sermon series
[3795.76 --> 3796.44]  was teaching us
[3796.44 --> 3797.94]  how God is sovereign
[3797.94 --> 3799.26]  even over our adversity
[3799.26 --> 3800.96]  and he uses it
[3800.96 --> 3801.64]  for his glory.
[3802.18 --> 3804.44]  So yes,
[3804.52 --> 3805.64]  God uses our adversity
[3805.64 --> 3806.32]  and yes,
[3806.52 --> 3807.98]  that is often hard to see
[3807.98 --> 3809.02]  in the midst of our pain
[3809.02 --> 3810.86]  but while that is true,
[3812.24 --> 3812.84]  oftentimes,
[3813.12 --> 3814.04]  our adversity,
[3814.28 --> 3815.14]  it highlights
[3815.14 --> 3816.22]  where we turn
[3816.22 --> 3817.04]  for comfort.
[3818.96 --> 3819.80]  It highlights
[3819.80 --> 3820.90]  where we turn to
[3820.90 --> 3822.08]  to find a bit of comfort
[3822.08 --> 3822.70]  in this world.
[3822.70 --> 3826.16]  And so Israel here
[3826.16 --> 3827.10]  was finding their comfort
[3827.10 --> 3828.16]  in the things of this world
[3828.16 --> 3829.52]  but when life is difficult,
[3829.88 --> 3830.78]  where do we turn
[3830.78 --> 3831.28]  for comfort?
[3833.56 --> 3835.02]  Our text says
[3835.02 --> 3835.86]  we find comfort
[3835.86 --> 3836.76]  from the word.
[3837.04 --> 3837.42]  Comfort,
[3837.92 --> 3838.36]  comfort,
[3838.54 --> 3839.24]  my people,
[3839.68 --> 3840.46]  says your God.
[3842.04 --> 3842.58]  God's people
[3842.58 --> 3843.12]  were conquered.
[3843.26 --> 3843.42]  Yes,
[3843.48 --> 3844.18]  they were forsaken
[3844.18 --> 3845.56]  but they were not forgotten.
[3845.56 --> 3848.28]  the entirety of our passage,
[3848.40 --> 3849.06]  Isaiah 40,
[3849.14 --> 3850.02]  verses 1 to 11
[3850.02 --> 3851.36]  is about the promise
[3851.36 --> 3852.56]  of restoration
[3852.56 --> 3853.90]  for God's people.
[3854.36 --> 3855.42]  In verse 2 of our text,
[3855.52 --> 3856.70]  God forgives the sins
[3856.70 --> 3857.42]  of his people.
[3857.86 --> 3858.20]  He says,
[3858.44 --> 3859.70]  her sin has been paid for.
[3859.96 --> 3860.58]  She has received
[3860.58 --> 3861.46]  from the Lord's hand
[3861.46 --> 3863.12]  double for all her sins.
[3863.12 --> 3864.80]  In verse 3,
[3864.88 --> 3865.70]  we read about
[3865.70 --> 3866.46]  how they will be
[3866.46 --> 3867.50]  delivered from exile
[3867.50 --> 3868.32]  as God will make
[3868.32 --> 3869.12]  straight in the desert
[3869.12 --> 3870.10]  a highway for them
[3870.10 --> 3871.30]  to return back
[3871.30 --> 3872.52]  to Judah from Babylon.
[3872.86 --> 3873.56]  And in verse 10,
[3873.62 --> 3874.38]  we hear about a king
[3874.38 --> 3875.26]  who will come to reign
[3875.26 --> 3876.18]  over them in power
[3876.18 --> 3878.42]  and rule with a mighty arm.
[3878.78 --> 3879.90]  And all of this points
[3879.90 --> 3881.66]  to God bringing comfort
[3881.66 --> 3882.68]  and salvation
[3882.68 --> 3883.86]  to his people.
[3885.22 --> 3886.16]  But of course,
[3886.30 --> 3887.02]  this passage
[3887.02 --> 3888.88]  is so much more
[3888.88 --> 3889.88]  than a promise
[3889.88 --> 3890.62]  to bring comfort
[3890.62 --> 3891.30]  in the form
[3891.30 --> 3892.88]  of returning these people
[3892.88 --> 3893.54]  from exile.
[3894.66 --> 3895.50]  This passage
[3895.50 --> 3896.42]  is a promise
[3896.42 --> 3898.74]  of a future Messiah.
[3900.12 --> 3900.80]  As mentioned,
[3900.88 --> 3901.46]  verse 3 and 4
[3901.46 --> 3902.32]  talk about preparing
[3902.32 --> 3903.26]  a way in the wilderness
[3903.26 --> 3903.88]  for the Lord,
[3903.96 --> 3904.56]  making straight
[3904.56 --> 3905.08]  a desert,
[3905.18 --> 3905.58]  in the desert,
[3905.68 --> 3906.84]  a highway for God.
[3907.20 --> 3908.22]  Now this is not only
[3908.22 --> 3909.26]  talking about preparing
[3909.26 --> 3910.18]  a way out of Babylon,
[3910.88 --> 3911.98]  but it's about preparing
[3911.98 --> 3913.70]  the way for a coming Messiah.
[3914.72 --> 3915.60]  In your Bibles,
[3915.74 --> 3916.92]  flip over to the beginning
[3916.92 --> 3917.68]  of Mark.
[3917.76 --> 3918.88]  Mark chapter 1,
[3918.94 --> 3919.84]  verses 1 to 3
[3919.84 --> 3920.40]  for a second.
[3920.92 --> 3921.78]  Because this text
[3921.78 --> 3922.72]  is found there too.
[3923.86 --> 3924.78]  Mark's gospel
[3924.78 --> 3925.98]  starts by saying this,
[3926.34 --> 3926.80]  the beginning
[3926.80 --> 3927.56]  of the good news
[3927.56 --> 3928.78]  about Jesus the Messiah,
[3928.90 --> 3929.70]  the Son of God,
[3929.94 --> 3931.16]  as it is written
[3931.16 --> 3933.22]  in Isaiah the prophet.
[3934.04 --> 3935.00]  I will send
[3935.00 --> 3936.22]  my messenger ahead of you
[3936.22 --> 3936.92]  who will prepare
[3936.92 --> 3937.54]  your way,
[3937.78 --> 3938.68]  a voice of one
[3938.68 --> 3939.70]  calling in the wilderness,
[3940.18 --> 3941.10]  prepare the way
[3941.10 --> 3941.84]  for the Lord,
[3941.94 --> 3942.90]  make straight paths
[3942.90 --> 3943.32]  for him.
[3943.74 --> 3945.42]  And so John the Baptist
[3945.42 --> 3947.22]  appeared in the wilderness,
[3947.80 --> 3948.90]  preaching a baptism
[3948.90 --> 3949.70]  of repentance
[3949.70 --> 3950.82]  for their forgiveness
[3950.82 --> 3951.84]  of sins.
[3951.92 --> 3952.56]  And I'll skip ahead
[3952.56 --> 3953.72]  to verse 7 here with me.
[3953.98 --> 3955.24]  And this was his message.
[3956.50 --> 3957.82]  After me comes the one
[3957.82 --> 3959.86]  more powerful than I,
[3959.98 --> 3961.28]  the straps of whose sandals
[3961.28 --> 3962.24]  I am not worthy
[3962.24 --> 3963.84]  to stoop down and untie.
[3964.66 --> 3965.70]  John the Baptist says,
[3965.80 --> 3967.04]  I baptize you with water,
[3967.12 --> 3968.50]  but he will baptize you
[3968.50 --> 3969.40]  with the Holy Spirit.
[3969.40 --> 3972.12]  Our text today
[3972.12 --> 3972.90]  is not simply
[3972.90 --> 3974.42]  about the Israelites
[3974.42 --> 3975.20]  being saved
[3975.20 --> 3976.08]  from their captivity
[3976.08 --> 3977.12]  to the Babylonians.
[3977.20 --> 3977.62]  It's about
[3977.62 --> 3982.22]  the Messiah.
[3984.18 --> 3985.32]  It's about John
[3985.32 --> 3986.24]  preparing the world
[3986.24 --> 3986.86]  for Jesus.
[3987.84 --> 3988.84]  This text is about
[3988.84 --> 3989.82]  the coming king,
[3989.92 --> 3991.04]  the king of kings,
[3991.14 --> 3992.08]  the one who will rule
[3992.08 --> 3993.10]  with a mighty hand,
[3993.16 --> 3994.10]  the one who will gather
[3994.10 --> 3995.38]  his lambs
[3995.38 --> 3996.30]  and carry them
[3996.30 --> 3997.24]  close to his heart,
[3997.24 --> 3998.54]  the one who tenderly
[3998.54 --> 3999.96]  says to all of this,
[4000.72 --> 4002.40]  your sins have been forgiven.
[4004.44 --> 4006.48]  Your sins have been paid for.
[4008.46 --> 4009.96]  This is a perfect text
[4009.96 --> 4010.44]  for Advent
[4010.44 --> 4013.34]  because Jesus is coming,
[4013.86 --> 4014.78]  it says to us.
[4015.94 --> 4016.54]  And this, of course,
[4016.62 --> 4017.36]  comes to fruition
[4017.36 --> 4018.30]  on Christmas Day
[4018.30 --> 4019.30]  when we celebrate
[4019.30 --> 4020.18]  the coming of Jesus
[4020.18 --> 4020.82]  into the world.
[4021.18 --> 4022.94]  Jesus came to save us
[4022.94 --> 4023.94]  from the root
[4023.94 --> 4025.40]  of all our discomfort.
[4025.40 --> 4027.14]  sin.
[4027.92 --> 4028.84]  Jesus came
[4028.84 --> 4030.40]  to forgive sins.
[4030.72 --> 4031.52]  Mark 1 starts
[4031.52 --> 4032.34]  with John the Baptist
[4032.34 --> 4032.90]  and describes
[4032.90 --> 4033.68]  how he prepared
[4033.68 --> 4034.94]  the way for the Messiah.
[4035.04 --> 4035.84]  If you go one chapter
[4035.84 --> 4037.14]  further to Mark 2,
[4037.48 --> 4038.10]  we read about
[4038.10 --> 4039.36]  why Jesus came.
[4040.32 --> 4040.96]  In Mark 2,
[4041.00 --> 4041.78]  verses 1 to 12,
[4041.84 --> 4042.28]  we read about
[4042.28 --> 4043.22]  how Jesus heals
[4043.22 --> 4044.34]  this paralyzed man.
[4044.68 --> 4045.44]  This man was brought
[4045.44 --> 4046.50]  to Jesus on a stretcher
[4046.50 --> 4047.14]  by his friends,
[4047.34 --> 4047.96]  but they couldn't
[4047.96 --> 4048.56]  get to him.
[4049.10 --> 4049.62]  And so,
[4049.72 --> 4050.42]  they make a hole
[4050.42 --> 4050.92]  in the roof
[4050.92 --> 4051.58]  and they lowered
[4051.58 --> 4052.76]  the man down to him.
[4053.54 --> 4054.88]  If you've got your Bibles,
[4054.88 --> 4056.36]  look at Mark 2,
[4056.44 --> 4056.96]  verse 5.
[4057.04 --> 4058.38]  What is the first thing
[4058.38 --> 4058.98]  Jesus says
[4058.98 --> 4059.94]  when he sees this man
[4059.94 --> 4060.38]  in Mark 2,
[4060.42 --> 4060.86]  verse 5?
[4062.46 --> 4064.46]  Your sins are forgiven.
[4066.52 --> 4067.36]  Now, the leaders,
[4067.48 --> 4068.64]  they start brain hemorrhaging
[4068.64 --> 4069.80]  because how dare
[4069.80 --> 4071.08]  he forgive sins?
[4071.96 --> 4073.48]  Only God can do that.
[4074.30 --> 4075.20]  But Jesus even knows
[4075.20 --> 4075.98]  their thoughts.
[4077.80 --> 4078.86]  And he says this,
[4078.92 --> 4080.20]  why are you thinking
[4080.20 --> 4080.94]  these things?
[4082.12 --> 4083.44]  Which is easier to say
[4083.44 --> 4084.54]  to this paralyzed man?
[4084.54 --> 4085.96]  Your sins are forgiven?
[4086.86 --> 4087.86]  Or to say,
[4088.08 --> 4088.72]  get up,
[4088.84 --> 4089.38]  take your mat,
[4089.44 --> 4089.92]  and walk?
[4091.22 --> 4092.02]  And listen to this,
[4092.26 --> 4093.54]  but I want you to know
[4093.54 --> 4094.42]  that the Son of Man
[4094.42 --> 4095.80]  has authority on earth
[4095.80 --> 4096.80]  to forgive sins.
[4098.74 --> 4100.06]  And so he heals the man.
[4101.00 --> 4102.22]  And the man gets up
[4102.22 --> 4103.60]  and walks out of there.
[4104.66 --> 4105.80]  But you see what Jesus does?
[4106.52 --> 4107.54]  Jesus addresses
[4107.54 --> 4108.54]  the deeper problem
[4109.14 --> 4110.22]  with this man first,
[4110.42 --> 4111.02]  his sin,
[4111.88 --> 4113.08]  the ultimate discomfort.
[4113.08 --> 4115.00]  And then he heals him.
[4115.08 --> 4115.68]  For what reason?
[4116.62 --> 4118.12]  To show that he has power
[4118.12 --> 4118.86]  over sin
[4118.86 --> 4120.50]  in the first place.
[4121.26 --> 4122.14]  He wanted everyone
[4122.14 --> 4123.88]  to know that he has authority
[4123.88 --> 4125.00]  on earth
[4125.00 --> 4125.86]  to forgive sins.
[4126.24 --> 4127.40]  Jesus came
[4127.40 --> 4128.48]  to defeat sin.
[4129.62 --> 4130.44]  Jesus was born
[4130.44 --> 4131.16]  into this world
[4131.16 --> 4131.88]  on a manger,
[4131.98 --> 4132.54]  a day that we're going
[4132.54 --> 4133.44]  to celebrate and remember
[4133.44 --> 4134.34]  in just 10 days.
[4134.72 --> 4135.48]  He did this because
[4135.48 --> 4136.78]  he came to rid the world
[4136.78 --> 4138.06]  of that discomfort,
[4138.22 --> 4139.14]  of our sin.
[4139.14 --> 4140.72]  Jesus came and he lived
[4140.72 --> 4141.88]  a perfect life
[4141.88 --> 4142.48]  that you and I
[4142.48 --> 4143.74]  fail to live each
[4143.74 --> 4144.58]  and every day.
[4144.68 --> 4145.84]  And then he died a death
[4145.84 --> 4146.92]  that we deserve
[4146.92 --> 4148.22]  because of that sin.
[4149.12 --> 4150.24]  And he took that sin
[4150.24 --> 4150.78]  on his shoulders
[4150.78 --> 4152.16]  and he bore it with him
[4152.16 --> 4153.08]  onto the cross.
[4153.46 --> 4154.34]  And he died.
[4155.78 --> 4156.30]  But then,
[4156.56 --> 4157.30]  three days later,
[4157.38 --> 4158.36]  Jesus rose again
[4158.36 --> 4158.96]  from the tomb
[4158.96 --> 4160.26]  and he defeated sin
[4160.26 --> 4160.66]  and death.
[4160.74 --> 4162.02]  And then later,
[4162.12 --> 4162.98]  he ascends to heaven
[4162.98 --> 4163.82]  where now he's sitting
[4163.82 --> 4164.52]  on the right hand
[4164.52 --> 4165.70]  of God the Father Almighty.
[4165.70 --> 4169.08]  And he will come again
[4169.08 --> 4170.42]  one day
[4170.42 --> 4172.56]  to rid the world
[4172.56 --> 4173.56]  of this sin
[4173.56 --> 4174.52]  for all of eternity.
[4175.66 --> 4177.20]  Jesus came
[4177.20 --> 4178.84]  to defeat sin.
[4179.84 --> 4182.10]  This is our true comfort.
[4184.38 --> 4185.24]  See, this text today
[4185.24 --> 4185.82]  is about God
[4185.82 --> 4186.74]  saving his people
[4186.74 --> 4187.92]  from our own misguided
[4187.92 --> 4189.32]  comforts of this world.
[4189.38 --> 4190.62]  The sin that so easily
[4190.62 --> 4191.40]  entangles us.
[4191.80 --> 4193.06]  Isaiah 41 to 11
[4193.06 --> 4195.20]  was as hopeful a text
[4195.20 --> 4196.96]  for the Israelite people
[4196.96 --> 4198.52]  in captivity back then
[4198.52 --> 4200.98]  as it is for us
[4200.98 --> 4202.06]  as a promise
[4202.06 --> 4204.14]  and a reality check today.
[4205.36 --> 4207.08]  Because this promise
[4207.08 --> 4208.26]  is still true.
[4208.98 --> 4210.14]  Jesus redeems us.
[4210.42 --> 4211.44]  The grass withers
[4211.44 --> 4212.94]  and flowers fall,
[4213.08 --> 4214.84]  but the word of God
[4214.84 --> 4215.84]  endures forever.
[4216.40 --> 4218.06]  His word endures forever.
[4218.94 --> 4220.18]  The word became flesh
[4220.18 --> 4221.02]  and made his dwelling
[4221.02 --> 4221.50]  among us.
[4221.76 --> 4222.38]  And as we sit
[4222.38 --> 4223.50]  in this Advent season,
[4223.50 --> 4225.22]  may we remember that.
[4226.16 --> 4226.96]  True comfort
[4226.96 --> 4228.80]  comes from the word.
[4230.18 --> 4231.58]  The word made flesh.
[4231.76 --> 4232.98]  Jesus Christ's life,
[4233.34 --> 4233.58]  death,
[4233.78 --> 4234.48]  and resurrection.
[4236.38 --> 4237.10]  So how?
[4237.20 --> 4237.96]  What does this look like?
[4239.76 --> 4240.84]  Well, our text today
[4240.84 --> 4241.80]  is actually the beginning
[4241.80 --> 4243.46]  of a large chunk of text
[4243.46 --> 4244.24]  that starts here
[4244.24 --> 4245.06]  with Isaiah 40
[4245.06 --> 4245.98]  and goes all the way
[4245.98 --> 4246.96]  through Isaiah 55.
[4247.44 --> 4247.78]  If you remember
[4247.78 --> 4248.20]  at the beginning,
[4248.26 --> 4249.10]  I talked about how scholars
[4249.10 --> 4249.72]  said this is like
[4249.72 --> 4251.26]  the second chunk of Isaiah.
[4251.26 --> 4252.20]  That's the chunk,
[4252.30 --> 4253.48]  Isaiah 40 to 55.
[4255.02 --> 4255.98]  Now this comfort
[4255.98 --> 4257.06]  that God is talking about
[4257.06 --> 4257.78]  in our text today
[4257.78 --> 4258.68]  is revealed throughout
[4258.68 --> 4260.42]  this whole chunk of text.
[4261.92 --> 4263.16]  It's there we get a picture
[4263.16 --> 4263.96]  of how this comfort
[4263.96 --> 4265.54]  is lived out by his people.
[4266.50 --> 4267.44]  In Isaiah 55,
[4267.66 --> 4268.16]  1 to 5,
[4268.24 --> 4269.20]  we read of an invitation
[4269.20 --> 4270.24]  to all people.
[4270.70 --> 4271.70]  Those who are thirsty,
[4271.84 --> 4272.68]  those who are hungry,
[4272.84 --> 4273.78]  those who have money,
[4273.90 --> 4274.78]  those who have little,
[4274.98 --> 4276.26]  all people are invited.
[4276.54 --> 4277.66]  This invitation is not
[4277.66 --> 4278.72]  just for Israel,
[4278.80 --> 4280.02]  but for the surrounding nations
[4280.02 --> 4281.62]  as well because he,
[4282.00 --> 4282.26]  God,
[4282.34 --> 4284.12]  has endowed his people
[4284.12 --> 4284.78]  with splendor.
[4286.14 --> 4287.40]  So Isaiah 40 starts
[4287.40 --> 4288.64]  with the promise
[4288.64 --> 4289.74]  of a Messiah
[4289.74 --> 4290.60]  that will bring comfort
[4290.60 --> 4291.38]  to his people
[4291.38 --> 4292.94]  and then Isaiah 55
[4292.94 --> 4294.88]  points to the community
[4294.88 --> 4296.54]  that will come together
[4296.54 --> 4297.58]  because of that news.
[4298.74 --> 4300.46]  This comfort of Christ
[4300.46 --> 4302.42]  brings the community together.
[4304.10 --> 4305.38]  The themes of this passage
[4305.38 --> 4306.54]  remind me of Hebrews 12,
[4306.62 --> 4307.12]  1 to 3.
[4307.28 --> 4307.78]  It says this,
[4307.78 --> 4308.30]  Therefore,
[4308.48 --> 4309.36]  since we are surrounded
[4309.36 --> 4310.48]  by such a great cloud
[4310.48 --> 4311.00]  of witnesses,
[4311.38 --> 4312.42]  let us throw off
[4312.42 --> 4313.64]  everything that hinders
[4313.64 --> 4314.42]  and the sin
[4314.42 --> 4315.88]  that so easily entangles
[4315.88 --> 4317.58]  and let us run the race
[4317.58 --> 4318.42]  with perseverance
[4318.42 --> 4319.50]  marked out for us,
[4319.82 --> 4321.14]  fixing our eyes on Jesus,
[4321.28 --> 4321.86]  the pioneer
[4321.86 --> 4322.84]  and perfecter
[4322.84 --> 4324.10]  of our faith.
[4324.90 --> 4326.38]  For the joy set before him
[4326.38 --> 4327.28]  he endured the cross,
[4327.46 --> 4328.30]  scorning its shame,
[4328.50 --> 4329.38]  and sat down
[4329.38 --> 4330.32]  at the right hand
[4330.32 --> 4331.42]  of the throne of God.
[4332.18 --> 4332.90]  Consider him
[4332.90 --> 4333.50]  who endured
[4333.50 --> 4334.26]  such opposition
[4334.26 --> 4334.80]  from sinners
[4334.80 --> 4335.98]  that you will not
[4335.98 --> 4336.74]  grow weary
[4336.74 --> 4337.82]  and lose heart.
[4340.38 --> 4341.98]  As life makes us weary
[4341.98 --> 4343.50]  because of health struggles
[4343.50 --> 4345.04]  or relationship strain
[4345.04 --> 4345.74]  or difficulties
[4345.74 --> 4346.60]  at work or school
[4346.60 --> 4347.98]  or whatever difficulties
[4347.98 --> 4349.90]  discomfort us right now,
[4350.50 --> 4352.02]  we are surrounded
[4352.02 --> 4353.18]  by a community
[4353.18 --> 4355.64]  who encourages us
[4355.64 --> 4356.56]  to fix our eyes
[4356.56 --> 4357.08]  on Jesus.
[4357.08 --> 4361.08]  this is done
[4361.08 --> 4362.06]  as the body of Christ.
[4362.16 --> 4363.22]  We do this work together
[4363.22 --> 4364.36]  as the community of God.
[4366.94 --> 4368.20]  When I was in elementary school
[4368.20 --> 4368.78]  we always had
[4368.78 --> 4370.38]  a track meet every year
[4370.38 --> 4372.72]  and I got to go
[4372.72 --> 4373.22]  every time.
[4373.30 --> 4373.86]  Looking at me now
[4373.86 --> 4374.74]  maybe that's hard to tell
[4374.74 --> 4376.32]  but I did used to run.
[4377.46 --> 4378.34]  I wasn't the best
[4378.34 --> 4379.34]  but I got to go every year
[4379.34 --> 4380.16]  so that was nice.
[4380.90 --> 4381.88]  One time though
[4381.88 --> 4382.40]  due to like
[4382.40 --> 4383.48]  a scheduling conflict
[4383.48 --> 4384.72]  at the actual event,
[4384.72 --> 4387.56]  I was thrown into a race
[4387.56 --> 4388.68]  I had never competed in.
[4389.52 --> 4391.70]  It was the 4x400 relay.
[4392.24 --> 4393.40]  A whole lap sprint
[4393.40 --> 4394.74]  around the track.
[4395.16 --> 4395.88]  I was pretty anxious
[4395.88 --> 4396.54]  because I had never
[4396.54 --> 4397.40]  run this race before.
[4398.48 --> 4399.68]  Our team was made up,
[4399.86 --> 4401.16]  the whole group's teams
[4401.16 --> 4401.60]  were made up
[4401.60 --> 4402.66]  of one grade four boy,
[4402.74 --> 4403.60]  one grade five boy,
[4403.68 --> 4404.54]  one grade six boy
[4404.54 --> 4405.06]  and then me,
[4405.18 --> 4406.20]  the grade seven boy.
[4407.62 --> 4408.34]  400 meters,
[4408.42 --> 4408.76]  like I said,
[4408.80 --> 4409.52]  was not my race
[4409.52 --> 4411.18]  and as you look at me now
[4411.18 --> 4411.56]  you can tell
[4411.56 --> 4412.54]  I was a bit of a short track
[4412.54 --> 4413.18]  sprinter myself
[4413.18 --> 4416.10]  so not high jump though,
[4416.14 --> 4416.60]  had the vertical
[4416.60 --> 4417.10]  of a walrus.
[4417.20 --> 4417.42]  Anyways,
[4417.62 --> 4419.22]  I had to run the last leg.
[4419.42 --> 4420.78]  I had to run the last leg
[4420.78 --> 4421.64]  of this race
[4421.64 --> 4422.84]  because I was the grade seven kid.
[4423.34 --> 4424.34]  So the grade fours went first
[4424.34 --> 4425.00]  then the grade fives
[4425.00 --> 4425.66]  then the grade sixes
[4425.66 --> 4426.08]  and then me,
[4426.34 --> 4427.06]  the final leg.
[4428.54 --> 4429.42]  By the time the baton
[4429.42 --> 4430.22]  had gotten to me,
[4430.44 --> 4431.56]  we were in third place
[4431.56 --> 4432.44]  and we're pretty isolated.
[4432.62 --> 4434.12]  They were pretty far behind me
[4434.12 --> 4434.94]  and the people ahead of me
[4434.94 --> 4435.36]  were far ahead.
[4435.44 --> 4436.18]  First place was like
[4436.18 --> 4437.06]  over 100 meters away
[4437.06 --> 4438.04]  and second place was like
[4438.04 --> 4440.00]  at least 50 meters ahead
[4440.00 --> 4441.06]  but out of all of the races
[4441.06 --> 4441.54]  I ran,
[4442.22 --> 4442.80]  this is the one
[4442.80 --> 4443.62]  I remember most
[4443.62 --> 4445.88]  because as I got the baton
[4445.88 --> 4447.96]  I instantly started hearing
[4447.96 --> 4449.04]  the school cheering me on.
[4449.76 --> 4451.08]  I rounded the first corner
[4451.08 --> 4451.96]  and my brother was out
[4451.96 --> 4452.30]  in the field
[4452.30 --> 4453.30]  doing long jump or something
[4453.30 --> 4454.62]  and I hear him shout my name too,
[4454.70 --> 4455.20]  go Kev!
[4456.00 --> 4457.12]  I go down the straight
[4457.12 --> 4458.16]  and I round the next corner
[4458.16 --> 4459.18]  and I hear more voices
[4459.18 --> 4459.94]  that I recognize
[4459.94 --> 4461.32]  and I look up
[4461.32 --> 4461.80]  and I realize
[4461.80 --> 4462.72]  second place actually
[4462.72 --> 4463.44]  is within shot
[4463.44 --> 4465.96]  and so my lungs are burning
[4465.96 --> 4466.60]  and I'm tired
[4466.60 --> 4468.10]  but I pass second place
[4468.10 --> 4469.46]  right at the finish line.
[4469.46 --> 4473.38]  I didn't even win the race
[4473.38 --> 4475.64]  but I do remember
[4475.64 --> 4476.50]  being propelled
[4476.50 --> 4477.32]  by that community
[4477.32 --> 4478.04]  to get there.
[4479.50 --> 4480.24]  It was the best
[4480.24 --> 4480.90]  second place ribbon
[4480.90 --> 4481.38]  I've ever got.
[4482.48 --> 4483.90]  That's what community does.
[4485.16 --> 4486.36]  They propel us
[4486.36 --> 4487.04]  when we're weary.
[4487.38 --> 4488.38]  They inspire us
[4488.38 --> 4489.22]  when we need encouragement.
[4489.66 --> 4491.06]  They can push us forward
[4491.06 --> 4492.54]  even if we're hurting,
[4492.86 --> 4493.88]  even if we're anxious.
[4495.10 --> 4496.60]  They can help point us
[4496.60 --> 4497.46]  to the finish line
[4497.46 --> 4499.92]  so we can run this race well.
[4501.92 --> 4502.62]  See our comfort
[4502.62 --> 4504.02]  it starts with Christ
[4504.02 --> 4505.58]  and what he has done for us
[4505.58 --> 4506.74]  and it's lived out
[4506.74 --> 4507.48]  by the body.
[4510.36 --> 4510.76]  Finally,
[4510.86 --> 4511.70]  and I'm going to close with this
[4511.70 --> 4512.66]  so just stick with me.
[4514.42 --> 4515.72]  While we find our comfort
[4515.72 --> 4516.24]  in Jesus
[4516.24 --> 4517.40]  and that is lived out
[4517.40 --> 4517.98]  in reality
[4517.98 --> 4518.96]  by us as a church,
[4519.04 --> 4519.74]  by the community,
[4519.74 --> 4522.10]  it all points to one thing
[4522.10 --> 4524.02]  and that is worship.
[4524.02 --> 4526.90]  The second part of Isaiah
[4526.90 --> 4528.98]  starts at chapter 40
[4528.98 --> 4529.94]  with the words
[4529.94 --> 4531.46]  comfort, comfort my people
[4531.46 --> 4532.10]  says the Lord
[4532.10 --> 4533.70]  and then it ends
[4533.70 --> 4534.92]  in Isaiah 55
[4534.92 --> 4536.84]  verses 12 and 13
[4536.84 --> 4538.40]  where it says
[4538.40 --> 4539.60]  you will go in joy
[4539.60 --> 4541.20]  and be led forth in peace.
[4541.36 --> 4542.60]  The mountains and the hills
[4542.60 --> 4544.12]  will burst into song
[4544.12 --> 4544.66]  before you
[4544.66 --> 4545.62]  and all the trees
[4545.62 --> 4546.52]  of the field
[4546.52 --> 4547.66]  will clap their hands.
[4549.34 --> 4550.44]  In our trouble,
[4551.36 --> 4552.08]  true comfort
[4552.08 --> 4553.06]  is found in the word.
[4553.06 --> 4554.24]  That comfort leads us
[4554.24 --> 4554.86]  to community
[4554.86 --> 4556.22]  who through the power
[4556.22 --> 4556.74]  and guidance
[4556.74 --> 4557.62]  of the Holy Spirit
[4557.62 --> 4558.96]  helps us persevere
[4558.96 --> 4559.68]  through the trials
[4559.68 --> 4560.58]  that we face
[4560.58 --> 4561.44]  in our lives
[4561.44 --> 4562.48]  and all of that,
[4563.08 --> 4564.88]  all of that
[4564.88 --> 4566.88]  leads us to do one thing,
[4568.26 --> 4568.58]  worship.
[4572.42 --> 4573.74]  Our only comfort
[4573.74 --> 4575.70]  in life and in death
[4575.70 --> 4576.50]  is that we are not
[4576.50 --> 4577.06]  our own
[4577.06 --> 4578.40]  but belong body and soul
[4578.40 --> 4579.36]  in life and in death
[4579.36 --> 4580.36]  to our faithful Savior
[4580.36 --> 4581.12]  Jesus Christ.
[4581.46 --> 4582.30]  He is fully paid
[4582.30 --> 4583.54]  for all of our sins
[4583.54 --> 4584.80]  by his precious blood
[4584.80 --> 4585.64]  and has set us free
[4585.64 --> 4586.54]  from the tyranny
[4586.54 --> 4587.60]  of the devil.
[4588.40 --> 4589.70]  He also watches over us
[4589.70 --> 4590.20]  in such a way
[4590.20 --> 4590.78]  that not a hair
[4590.78 --> 4592.10]  can fall from our head
[4592.10 --> 4593.98]  without the will
[4593.98 --> 4594.86]  of our Father in heaven.
[4595.94 --> 4596.52]  In fact,
[4596.64 --> 4598.20]  all things must work together
[4598.20 --> 4599.14]  for our salvation
[4599.14 --> 4600.62]  because we belong
[4600.62 --> 4601.20]  to Christ
[4601.20 --> 4602.44]  by his Holy Spirit
[4602.44 --> 4603.36]  he assures us
[4603.36 --> 4605.18]  of eternal life
[4605.18 --> 4606.14]  and makes us
[4606.14 --> 4607.36]  wholeheartedly willing
[4607.36 --> 4608.84]  and ready from now on
[4608.84 --> 4610.38]  to live for him.
[4611.12 --> 4612.72]  We can be certain
[4612.72 --> 4613.66]  of that.
[4615.86 --> 4617.50]  We can be comforted
[4617.50 --> 4618.52]  by that
[4618.52 --> 4619.78]  and only that
[4619.78 --> 4621.82]  because that is
[4621.82 --> 4622.92]  the promise of God
[4622.92 --> 4625.42]  and the word of God
[4625.42 --> 4627.04]  endures forever.
[4629.04 --> 4630.40]  And because of that comfort,
[4630.50 --> 4631.02]  our certainty,
[4633.36 --> 4633.94]  or that comfort
[4633.94 --> 4634.80]  is our certainty.
[4635.38 --> 4636.34]  Our only response
[4636.34 --> 4636.80]  is worship.
[4638.24 --> 4639.00]  Christ has come.
[4639.42 --> 4640.12]  Christ has won.
[4640.36 --> 4641.32]  Victory is assured
[4641.32 --> 4642.32]  and there is no more
[4642.32 --> 4643.16]  blessed assurance,
[4643.58 --> 4644.48]  no more comfort
[4644.48 --> 4645.10]  in this world
[4645.10 --> 4645.78]  than to know
[4645.78 --> 4646.60]  that we have been saved
[4646.60 --> 4647.06]  and redeemed
[4647.06 --> 4648.06]  by the word made flesh.
[4648.58 --> 4649.18]  True comfort
[4649.88 --> 4651.34]  found in the word.
[4651.66 --> 4652.66]  That's what gives us
[4652.66 --> 4653.62]  all our hope,
[4654.14 --> 4654.68]  our joy,
[4655.14 --> 4655.68]  our peace,
[4655.94 --> 4656.62]  and our comfort
[4656.62 --> 4657.24]  as we wait
[4657.24 --> 4658.08]  for Christmas Day
[4658.08 --> 4659.28]  this Advent season.
[4659.94 --> 4660.16]  Amen?
[4660.16 --> 4662.62]  Please pray with me
[4662.62 --> 4663.40]  and then we will
[4663.40 --> 4665.04]  respond in worship.
[4667.14 --> 4668.26]  Father in heaven,
[4669.92 --> 4671.20]  God,
[4671.28 --> 4672.12]  you have set forth
[4672.12 --> 4674.30]  this redemption plan
[4674.30 --> 4675.32]  from the start of time.
[4676.68 --> 4677.08]  Lord,
[4677.14 --> 4677.66]  we know that
[4677.66 --> 4678.76]  our only comfort
[4678.76 --> 4679.94]  in this life and death
[4679.94 --> 4681.18]  is that we belong to you.
[4682.18 --> 4682.70]  But God,
[4682.82 --> 4683.88]  sometimes we put
[4683.88 --> 4684.32]  our comfort
[4684.32 --> 4685.10]  in other things,
[4685.74 --> 4687.16]  sometimes even good things
[4687.16 --> 4687.98]  like family
[4687.98 --> 4689.74]  and others,
[4690.12 --> 4690.80]  but sometimes,
[4690.94 --> 4691.02]  God,
[4691.04 --> 4691.68]  we put our comfort
[4691.68 --> 4692.56]  in just things
[4692.56 --> 4693.68]  that draw us away from you,
[4694.58 --> 4695.64]  things that distract
[4695.64 --> 4696.38]  from what it is
[4696.38 --> 4697.44]  that you bring to us.
[4698.38 --> 4698.64]  God,
[4698.72 --> 4700.12]  reorient our comforts.
[4700.50 --> 4701.64]  Allow us to see you,
[4701.74 --> 4702.68]  the true comforter,
[4703.44 --> 4706.14]  as the place
[4706.14 --> 4706.98]  that we must turn
[4706.98 --> 4708.38]  when life is hard.
[4709.46 --> 4709.64]  God,
[4709.70 --> 4710.40]  may this community
[4710.40 --> 4711.02]  be a place
[4711.02 --> 4712.06]  that provides
[4712.06 --> 4712.74]  your comfort
[4712.74 --> 4713.46]  to your people.
[4715.12 --> 4716.38]  And as we go forth
[4716.38 --> 4717.08]  from this place,
[4717.08 --> 4717.80]  as we keep
[4717.80 --> 4719.08]  making our way
[4719.08 --> 4720.06]  through this Advent season,
[4720.18 --> 4720.32]  God,
[4720.38 --> 4722.76]  we surrender
[4722.76 --> 4723.80]  this to you.
[4725.16 --> 4726.46]  May we truly find
[4726.46 --> 4727.30]  our only comfort
[4727.30 --> 4727.88]  in you.
[4729.22 --> 4730.24]  And may we know
[4730.24 --> 4732.36]  to the depths
[4732.36 --> 4733.10]  of our heart
[4733.10 --> 4735.50]  that we are saved
[4735.50 --> 4738.28]  from the greatest
[4738.28 --> 4739.40]  discomfort of all,
[4739.98 --> 4740.36]  sin,
[4741.32 --> 4742.10]  that you have
[4742.10 --> 4742.80]  redeemed us
[4742.80 --> 4744.50]  and that we will be
[4744.50 --> 4745.28]  with you in glory.
[4745.28 --> 4748.50]  even so,
[4748.60 --> 4748.84]  come,
[4749.04 --> 4749.54]  Lord Jesus,
[4749.70 --> 4749.94]  come.
[4750.18 --> 4751.08]  We pray in your name.
[4751.36 --> 4751.60]  Amen.
[4751.60 --> 4751.74]  Amen.
[4751.80 --> 4753.00]  Amen.
[4753.00 --> 4753.58]  Amen.
[4753.58 --> 4753.64]  Amen.
[4755.70 --> 4756.10]  Amen.
[4756.30 --> 4756.72]  Amen.
[4760.08 --> 4760.56]  Amen.
[4762.64 --> 4763.96]  Amen.
[4770.80 --> 4771.26]  Amen.
[4771.74 --> 4773.84]  Amen.
[4773.88 --> 4774.20]  Amen.
[4774.20 --> 4775.54]  Amen.
[4775.64 --> 4776.54]  Amen.
[4776.54 --> 4776.64]  Amen.
[4776.64 --> 4777.62]  Amen.
[4777.62 --> 4778.98]  Amen.
[4778.98 --> 4779.58]  Amen.
[4779.58 --> 4779.86]  Amen.
[4779.86 --> 4780.62]  Amen.
[4780.62 --> 4781.62]  Amen.
[4810.62 --> 4812.62]  Amen.
[4840.62 --> 4842.62]  Amen.
[4870.62 --> 4872.62]  Amen.
[4900.62 --> 4902.62]  Amen.
[4930.62 --> 4932.62]  Amen.
[4960.62 --> 4962.62]  Amen.
[4990.62 --> 4992.62]  Amen.
[5020.62 --> 5022.62]  Amen.
[5040.62 --> 5048.84]  And so as we go from this place and into this week, may we remember the truth that our comfort comes from him.
[5048.84 --> 5050.84]  Amen.
[5050.84 --> 5054.84]  And so I invite you to join us after the service for some coffee in the foyer.
[5054.84 --> 5056.84]  Come hang out with one another.
[5056.84 --> 5062.84]  If you are in need of prayer this morning, there are going to be prayer people available to you right up here at the front or even in the back.
[5062.84 --> 5067.84]  Or you can come grab Pastor Chris or myself or really, to be honest with you, anybody here in this church will pray for you.
[5067.84 --> 5069.84]  So please seek that out if you need to.
[5069.84 --> 5077.84]  Before we go, though, please hear this parting blessing, the priestly blessing from number six, verses 24 to 26.
[5078.84 --> 5080.84]  The Lord bless you and keep you.
[5080.84 --> 5085.84]  The Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[5085.84 --> 5090.84]  The Lord turn his face toward you and give you his peace.
[5090.84 --> 5092.84]  And all of God's people said.
[5092.84 --> 5093.84]  Amen.
