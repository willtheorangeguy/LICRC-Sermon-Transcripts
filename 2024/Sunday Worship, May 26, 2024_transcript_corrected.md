[162.00 → 168.00] Thank you.
[168.00 → 173.36] Faith so weak that we could barely pray
[173.36 → 178.30] But He heard every word, every whisper
[178.30 → 184.88] Now those altars in the wilderness
[184.88 → 191.46] Tell the story of His faithfulness
[191.46 → 199.26] Never once did He fail, and He never will
[199.26 → 206.46] This is our God, this is who He is, He loves us
[206.46 → 212.52] This is our God, this is what He does, He saves us
[212.52 → 215.58] He pours the cross, we declare
[215.58 → 218.66] Let heaven and earth proclaim
[218.66 → 222.66] This is our God, King Jesus
[222.66 → 228.58] Who pulled me out of that pit?
[228.58 → 231.50] He did, He did
[231.50 → 234.40] Who paid for all of our sin?
[235.08 → 237.02] Nobody but Jesus

[273.34 → 277.34] This is our God, this is who He is, He loves us
[277.34 → 283.34] This is our God, this is what He does, He saves us
[283.34 → 289.34] He poured the cross, beat the grave, let heaven and earth proclaim

[299.34 → 301.34] Let heaven and earth proclaim
[301.34 → 304.34] This is our God, King Jesus
[311.34 → 316.34] Good morning.
[316.34 → 325.94] Good morning. Welcome to worship this morning. A special welcome if you are a guest with us
[325.94 → 332.82] this morning. My name is Chris. I'm one of the pastors here. We are very sparse this morning
[332.82 → 340.78] in part because cadet camp and youth camp both were this weekend and so a number of our youth
[340.78 → 346.00] and their leaders and some of their families now are also gathering for worship at their camp.
[346.50 → 351.70] Although I do see all the cadets here at least half of them who were at cadet camp so they made
[351.70 → 358.30] it so kudos to you bonus points to you guys for making it to church Sunday morning. But we're
[358.30 → 364.86] still going to worship the Lord in earnest together. This is why we gather. Before we begin I have a
[364.86 → 370.98] couple announcements just to share with you. First you may have seen it but at the Connect booth
[370.98 → 379.44] we're in the midst of a bottle campaign which is something to support mothers in need and so
[379.44 → 384.80] Brenda will be at the Connect booth following worship. You can connect with her. She can explain
[384.80 → 392.48] what that looks like, and you can participate in that there. As well next week Saturday we're hosting
[392.48 → 398.80] Lord willing another worship service at Sun ridge Gardens which is an old age retirement living home
[400.98 → 405.28] to go there once a month to lead in worship and so if you're interested in participating in that
[405.28 → 412.22] that starts at two o'clock next weeks Saturday and, so please be ready to go there and keep your eye
[412.22 → 418.54] into the midweek memo and the e-bulletin for more details on that. I think that's it for announcements
[418.54 → 424.02] this morning, and so I'm going to invite you as you're able to stand that we might be ushered into
[424.02 → 431.58] God's presence together. Following the receiving of God's greeting I'm going to invite you just to
[431.58 → 437.54] turn to those around you and welcome them in the name of the Lord to our worship together. Receive
[437.54 → 446.40] the greeting of our good God. Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father, from the Lord Jesus
[446.40 → 452.78] Christ, Son, and our Saviour through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[476.40 → 483.40] Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 34. I will exalt the Lord at all times.
[483.40 → 488.40] His praise will always be on my lips. My soul will boast in the Lord. Let the afflicted
[488.40 → 490.42] heal of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[497.40 → 505.40] Our call to worship this morning comes from Psalm 34. I will exalt the Lord at all times.
[505.40 → 510.40] His praise will always be on my lips. My soul will boast in the Lord. Let the afflicted heal of the Lord.
[510.40 → 514.44] in the Lord. Let the afflicted hear and rejoice.
[515.22 → 518.60] Glorify the Lord with me. Let us exalt his name
[518.60 → 522.58] together. With those words
[522.58 → 526.18] let us enter a time of personal and corporate worship to the Lord.
[540.40 → 543.78] A thousand generations
[543.78 → 547.26] upon your Lamb in worship
[547.26 → 552.36] will sing the song of ages to the Lamb.
[554.22 → 557.10] And all the God before us
[557.10 → 560.10] and all the will of thee
[560.10 → 564.72] will sing the song of ages to the Lamb.
[565.72 → 569.72] Your being is the highest
[569.72 → 572.96] Your name is the greatest
[572.96 → 576.46] Your name stands for love
[576.46 → 582.30] All come to the heavens
[582.30 → 585.10] All powers and positions
[585.10 → 588.86] Your name stands for love
[588.86 → 593.10] All angels rise
[593.10 → 599.14] Glory, O creation rise

[604.10 → 610.52] Holy, holy forever

[618.06 → 621.76] And if you've been redeemed
[621.76 → 626.14] Sing a song forever to the Lamb
[626.14 → 631.10] When you walk in freedom
[631.10 → 634.16] And if you bear His name
[634.16 → 638.72] Sing a song forever to the Lamb
[638.72 → 640.52] Sing a song forever to the Lamb

[655.52 → 656.52] Holy, holy forever to the Lamb
[656.52 → 657.52] Holy, holy, holy to the Lamb

[827.52 → 830.94] I've got a sin
[830.94 → 833.68] And love was born
[833.68 → 836.08] Power and fire
[836.08 → 839.14] And the gift of grace is born
[839.14 → 841.70] Up from the ashes
[841.70 → 844.36] Hope will arise

[1480.14 → 1481.02] Amen.
[1481.02 → 1481.66] Amen.
[1488.74 → 1490.52] Next week, Sunday, during our worship,
[1490.52 → 1492.56] Sunday during our worship,
[1492.56 → 1493.42] and then for a longer time after the worship,
[1493.42 → 1496.56] and then for a longer time after our worship,
[1496.58 → 1497.72] we have the opportunity to hear from Jennifer Gama ch Who is the
[1497.72 → 1502.72] to hear from Jennifer Remake, who is the director,
[1503.02 → 1506.54] the Lower Mainland Chapter Director for Safe Families Canada.
[1507.40 → 1514.44] Safe Families Canada is a ministry that works with families and children
[1514.44 → 1521.68] with the hope to keep them out of care, to provide support systems
[1521.68 → 1529.76] to walk with families who are struggling in order to keep them out of the system
[1529.76 → 1531.56] for as long as possible.
[1531.56 → 1539.90] And so they work with the MCFD, they work with other social workers and the like
[1539.90 → 1541.80] to come alongside families in need.
[1542.46 → 1545.32] Jennifer is going to come and share a little bit of that work with us,
[1545.50 → 1548.66] and then she's going to do, in the multipurpose room afterwards,
[1548.66 → 1552.90] a longer presentation, and the hope is that we might find ways
[1552.90 → 1557.40] that we can connect with that work and that ministry and support them
[1557.40 → 1558.94] and be part of that as a church.
[1559.28 → 1562.24] To prepare you for that, we've got a short video from them
[1562.24 → 1565.02] that we're just going to hear, give us an overview,
[1565.24 → 1570.14] hopefully pique your interest, and you can anticipate meeting Jennifer next week
[1570.14 → 1574.42] and then even maybe gathering in the multipurpose room to hear more about that work.
[1574.74 → 1576.20] And so we commend this video to you.
[1578.66 → 1581.56] After all, everything is working, making sure that we're meeting
[1581.56 → 1582.42] as part of the room towards the adversity.
[1583.40 → 1583.50] You're being dismayed that we see other people
[1583.50 → 1586.16] or people as part of the day should have run out of scope.
[1586.74 → 1588.04] I'm going to go to our and our grand shabby and ourληict log-fart,
[1588.48 → 1590.48] our portion of our painting, and our protagonist of my old grass
[1592.60 → 1595.24] has been blessed.
[1599.46 → 1602.16] But I'm going to go to our Ko стар1 pointaaaaaaH to do so począt1 like assets,
[1602.16 → 1603.22] my God's playing in the 1950s.
[1603.22 → 1604.34] But only if we were birthdays and people were King
[1604.34 → 1606.50] and our ult Annual Coop is project 한번 does with our cited.
[1606.50 → 1607.22] and our group were part of thementedifying Finances.
[1607.22 → 1607.66] we discussed I called him.
[1607.66 → 1616.26] Safe Families is an organization that helps people show biblical hospitality to their
[1616.26 → 1617.58] neighbours and communities.
[1617.58 → 1621.70] It trains churches and people within the churches to work together to provide a support network
[1621.70 → 1623.70] when a family is in a time of crisis.
[1623.70 → 1628.60] One of the goals for Safe Families is to help keep kids out of the foster care system.
[1628.60 → 1633.64] When families are in crisis and at that point of lead, that's when disasters happen and
[1633.64 → 1636.52] that's when the sorts of things that you can't come back from happen.
[1636.52 → 1640.20] So the goal is to step in before that point and help stabilize families.
[1640.20 → 1644.70] A lot of times the parents know if the situation continues to sort of unravel, the state's
[1644.70 → 1647.58] going to have to step in and watch their kids.
[1647.58 → 1652.22] And if the parents know about Safe Families, they know, here's an option where I can ask
[1652.22 → 1656.40] some of the people to step in and provide some support so that I can take care of some of
[1656.40 → 1658.40] these other pieces, these other elements.
[1658.40 → 1662.80] It's just like any other emergency or situation that wouldn't show up in our life.
[1662.80 → 1667.98] A medical emergency, getting evicted from a home, losing your job, losing your transportation
[1667.98 → 1669.48] or something within the family.
[1669.48 → 1672.18] You immediately start to lean on the people around you.
[1672.18 → 1675.48] And with Safe Families, there's people that are just prepared to be leaned on.
[1675.48 → 1676.48] They're ready.
[1676.48 → 1679.48] They're saying, okay, when this comes, lean on me and I'll help.
[1679.48 → 1684.70] Being able to do it together as a body of believers was just really exciting.
[1684.70 → 1687.38] We're building a community of people that support each other.
[1687.38 → 1689.88] The whole goal is stabilizing that family structure.
[1689.88 → 1694.30] The kids know that we're not the thing that's keeping them from their mom.
[1694.30 → 1696.38] We're sort of an extension of her caring.
[1696.38 → 1698.38] And we're a team.
[1698.38 → 1703.76] And give them the physical, emotional, and spiritual support that they need when they're
[1703.76 → 1705.88] going through really uncertain circumstances.
[1705.88 → 1711.20] There's a lot of people that hear about Safe Families, and they focus on the host family
[1711.20 → 1713.76] and think, I can't host kids.
[1713.76 → 1719.16] And what I really want those people to hear is how much that wider circle of support is
[1719.16 → 1720.16] so crucial.
[1720.16 → 1724.20] It enables us to be able to focus on the kids.
[1724.20 → 1728.54] It also is demonstrating to the kids that they're cared for by so many people.
[1728.54 → 1733.78] I get notified probably four or five times a week of a need to host children.
[1733.78 → 1735.12] It needs a lot of people then.
[1735.12 → 1740.18] There needs to be a lot of people that see this or hear this and say, I would do this for
[1740.18 → 1741.94] my family or friends.
[1741.94 → 1746.30] I just need to see the broader community and the people that are coming to Safe Families
[1746.30 → 1747.66] as part of my family.
[1747.66 → 1749.98] Anyone can be a part of this.
[1749.98 → 1753.46] Anytime, any bit of love, they're ready to receive.
[1753.46 → 1758.42] And it just shows a child that they're valuable, that they're wanted, that they have a future
[1758.42 → 1765.42] and all of that is something that Safe Families can provide them.
[1765.42 → 1784.10] Okay, good morning everyone.
[1784.10 → 1788.10] At this time of the service, we're going to do the affirmations of the names that we
[1788.10 → 1795.10] have that council has been presented with for council positions for next year.
[1795.10 → 1798.10] I just wanted to make a couple notes first.
[1798.10 → 1803.10] I'm thankful for the terms that are completed by Darrell Wynn, Mike Worst, Clem Molenkamp,
[1803.10 → 1804.10] and me.
[1804.10 → 1807.10] I guess that's what you've got to say.
[1807.10 → 1812.10] We're grateful for the nominations that we received this year.
[1812.10 → 1814.10] I'm sure many of you know about that.
[1814.10 → 1816.10] That's been in the bulletin in the midweek memos.
[1816.10 → 1822.10] It's Clary Klosterhof for Min Elder, Paul Hummel man, Pastoral Elder, Alison Pilot,
[1822.10 → 1825.10] and Pearl Den Hahn for Deacon.
[1825.10 → 1829.10] The by laws of a Langley Emanuel calls to affirm the nominees for office.
[1829.10 → 1831.10] We do that with a ballot vote.
[1831.10 → 1835.10] So if I could call a couple elders to come up and hand out the ballots please.
[1835.10 → 1838.10] So we'll be handing out these ballots to you.
[1838.10 → 1843.10] We also have pens here, so if you need a pen to fill out the ballot, you can do that as well.
[1843.10 → 1848.10] And please indicate your affirmation of the full slate by checking the first box.
[1848.10 → 1851.10] You'll see there are two boxes there.
[1851.10 → 1854.10] Indicate your affirmation for the full slate by checking the first box.
[1854.10 → 1859.10] If you have a concern, please indicate by checking box two and writing the names.
[1859.10 → 1863.10] When you're completed that, please fold the ballot in half.
[1863.10 → 1867.10] And when the collection bag goes around, you can just put it in there,
[1867.10 → 1874.10] and the deacons will count it up after the service.
[1874.10 → 1880.10] And the Lord willing, next Sunday we'll do the installation of the office fairs.
[1888.10 → 1892.10] If you need a pen, you can raise your hand.
[1897.10 → 1898.10] It won't be the last term.
[1898.10 → 1899.10] If I had any of the options for the vote, I would say it's the same.
[1899.10 → 1900.10] All right, thank you for that.
[1900.10 → 1901.10] All right.
[1901.10 → 1904.10] Thank you for that.
[1904.10 → 1906.10] Deacons, I guess you're up next here.
[1906.10 → 1907.10] Thank you.
[1907.10 → 1908.10] Yes.
[1908.10 → 1909.10] Thank you.
[1909.10 → 1910.10] Thank you.
[1910.10 → 1911.10] Thank you for that.
[1911.10 → 1917.10] Deacons, I guess you're up next here.
[1917.10 → 1918.10] All right.
[1918.10 → 1923.10] Thank you.
[1923.10 → 1925.10] Thank you.
[1925.10 → 1955.08] Thank you.
[1955.10 → 1966.04] Good morning. My name is Yap. I'm a deacon here at Langley Emanuel. This morning's collection will be for the budget. Please give as you're able to. Thank you.
[1985.10 → 1987.10] Thank you.
[1987.10 → 1989.10] Thank you.
[1989.10 → 1990.10] Thank you.
[1990.10 → 1997.10] Thank you.
[1997.10 → 1998.60] Thank you.
[1998.60 → 1999.10] Thank you.
[1999.10 → 2003.10] Thank you.
[2003.10 → 2007.10] Thank you.
[2007.10 → 2012.40] Jesus, help my heart and my heart and my soul.
[2013.46 → 2018.96] Jesus, help my voice and my peace and my love.
[2018.96 → 2025.00] Holy, I'll lay down the joy of my life.
[2025.60 → 2031.40] Jesus, help my voice and my love.
[2031.40 → 2038.16] You are my grace, my lips, my song.
[2038.16 → 2044.30] A living sacrifice of one before.
[2044.74 → 2047.32] Life is now my Lord.
[2047.88 → 2050.00] A rail is for God.
[2050.76 → 2056.06] Jesus, help my voice and my love.
[2056.06 → 2062.82] Jesus, help my voice and my love.
[2062.82 → 2066.12] You belong to the Lord.
[2066.48 → 2068.36] Praise the Lord.
[2069.36 → 2072.82] Jesus, help my voice and my love.
[2073.20 → 2078.82] Jesus, help my voice and my love.
[2078.82 → 2081.58] The Lord is for God.
[2081.58 → 2085.58] Come, Lord, Jesus, help my voice and my love.
[2088.58 → 2089.58] Jesus, help my voice and my love.
[2089.58 → 2091.92] Jesus, help my voice and my love.
[2091.92 → 2095.28] Your love will rise.
[2095.72 → 2099.58] Joy for which you freely gain.
[2100.08 → 2104.34] Your life, radiant in fire.
[2104.88 → 2107.46] Watch and fill your life.
[2107.46 → 2110.34] Jesus, help my voice and my love.
[2110.34 → 2112.12] Jesus, help my voice and my love.
[2114.22 → 2116.74] Jesus, help your voice and my love.
[2116.74 → 2120.30] Jesus, help your voice and my love.
[2120.30 → 2123.58] Praise your every day, Jesus.
[2123.84 → 2129.06] I can tell you, and all that makes me feel again.
[2129.94 → 2132.18] Glory for you, Lord.
[2133.06 → 2136.72] Jesus, help my voice and my love.
[2136.72 → 2151.72] Jesus, God, Lord, Jesus, God, Lord, You will know His glory, praise the Lord, He will come.
[2151.72 → 2181.70] Jesus, God, Lord, Jesus, God, Lord, You will know His glory, praise the Lord, He will come.
[2181.72 → 2211.70] Jesus, God, Lord, Jesus, God, Lord, You will know His glory, praise the Lord, He will come.
[2211.70 → 2218.70] Jesus, God, Lord, You will know His glory, praise the Lord, He will come.
[2218.70 → 2220.70] Jesus, God, Lord, He will come.
[2220.70 → 2225.70] Jesus, God, Lord, He will come.
[2225.70 → 2232.70] Jesus, God, Lord, He will come.
[2232.70 → 2234.70] Amen.
[2234.70 → 2235.70] Amen.
[2235.70 → 2239.70] Amen.
[2239.70 → 2241.70] Amen.
[2241.70 → 2243.70] Yeah.
[2243.70 → 2245.70] Amen.
[2245.70 → 2249.70] Oh, my, dear.
[2249.70 → 2255.70] All my dreams, all my dreams,
[2255.70 → 2261.70] and they know.
[2274.70 → 2276.70] Good morning. It's time for Kids' Corner,
[2276.70 → 2281.70] so I'd like to invite any of our kids here who are age 3 up to grade 4
[2281.70 → 2284.70] to come and join us at the front.
[2290.70 → 2296.70] I think we have a small little group, but there's still a few coming up.
[2296.70 → 2299.70] Yeah, there are a lot of girls up here,
[2299.70 → 2302.70] and some of the boys are away at cadet camp, I think.
[2302.70 → 2306.70] So this morning we're going to be thinking about gifts.
[2306.70 → 2309.70] Has anybody here ever gotten a gift, a present?
[2309.70 → 2310.70] Most of you?
[2310.70 → 2312.70] Most of you, maybe for your birthday or for Christmas
[2312.70 → 2314.70] or just for something special?
[2314.70 → 2316.70] Yeah, lots of you, okay?
[2316.70 → 2321.70] I want you to think about a really, really special gift that you maybe got.
[2321.70 → 2324.70] Something that you really wanted, or you might have had to wait for.
[2324.70 → 2330.70] Keep it in your head because we're going to talk about it when we get to the large group.
[2330.70 → 2334.70] But because I have the microphone, we're going to talk about my gift right now.
[2334.70 → 2336.70] But we'll talk about yours after.
[2336.70 → 2341.70] So when I was about, I think I was about maybe 8,
[2341.70 → 2344.70] there was something that I really, really wanted.
[2344.70 → 2348.70] And I asked my mom if I could have it, and do you know what she said?
[2348.70 → 2349.70] Yes.
[2349.70 → 2350.70] No.
[2350.70 → 2351.70] She said no.
[2351.70 → 2355.70] And I had to ask her again, and do you know what she said that time?
[2355.70 → 2357.70] She still said no.
[2357.70 → 2364.70] I had to ask her quite a few times, but one day, one day when I asked, she said yes.
[2364.70 → 2367.70] Do you think you know what I might have asked her?
[2367.70 → 2368.70] I'm going to let you take some guesses.
[2368.70 → 2371.70] I didn't really give you any clues, but we'll see what you come up with.
[2371.70 → 2372.70] Carious?
[2372.70 → 2373.70] A dog.
[2373.70 → 2375.70] Well, we already had a dog, so it wasn't a dog.
[2375.70 → 2376.70] A horse?
[2376.70 → 2377.70] A horse.
[2377.70 → 2381.70] My sister might have wanted a horse, but I didn't really want a horse.
[2381.70 → 2382.70] A cat.
[2382.70 → 2383.70] A cat.
[2383.70 → 2384.70] You're right.
[2384.70 → 2385.70] It was a cat.
[2385.70 → 2387.70] I really, really wanted a cat.
[2387.70 → 2389.70] And finally she said yes, and we got this cat.
[2389.70 → 2394.70] This was the only picture I could find in my house of my cat.
[2394.70 → 2395.70] That was my cat.
[2395.70 → 2396.70] His name was Tiger.
[2396.70 → 2400.70] And I was so excited because I wanted a cat for a few years.
[2400.70 → 2403.70] And finally my mom said yes, I could get a cat.
[2403.70 → 2409.70] And we looked in the newspaper, and we saw three kittens, and we went down to the house,
[2409.70 → 2410.70] and there were two kittens.
[2410.70 → 2416.70] There was one that was very easy to get, and one that was hiding in the middle of a very long carpet roll.
[2416.70 → 2418.70] And I said, I want that one.
[2418.70 → 2420.70] The one that's in the carpet and impossible to get out.
[2420.70 → 2426.70] And so we got him out and took him home, and I was so happy to have my cat.
[2426.70 → 2436.70] And so even though that was probably the most special gift that I could think of, we're going to talk today about an even more special gift that God has given us.
[2436.70 → 2438.70] And that is the Holy Spirit.
[2438.70 → 2450.70] So we're going to take a minute here just to stand and do our blessing, and then we're going to go learn more about that gift in our classes.
[2450.70 → 2454.70] We're going to take a minute here just to stand and do our blessing.
[2454.70 → 2456.70] The Lord be with you.
[2456.70 → 2458.70] And also with you.
[2480.70 → 2490.70] I always learn things about people from the children's worship time in the kids' corner there.
[2490.70 → 2498.70] And I was wondering as Nikki was talking, and she was looking back at Joan to see if Joan was going to change the story on her there or not.
[2498.70 → 2502.70] But it seems to me like parenting is a war of attrition sometimes.
[2502.70 → 2506.70] And if you just stick to it, maybe you won't end up with cats.
[2506.70 → 2512.70] It's my privilege to lead in our prayer this morning, our church family prayer.
[2512.70 → 2526.70] And before we do that, there are just a couple announcements and invitations to pray for that we've been asked to include and to add to what you may have seen in the e-bulletin already.
[2526.70 → 2534.70] First, this week is the CLASS meeting.
[2534.70 → 2540.70] So CLASS is the regional group of Christian Reformed churches that we are part of.
[2540.70 → 2552.70] And there's a special meeting on Wednesday that's taking place because one of the churches, one of our sister churches in our region, is going through some really hard things with their pastor and in the community.
[2552.70 → 2556.70] And so they've asked us to come together and support them.
[2556.70 → 2560.70] And so we're going to pray for them, and we're going to pray for our delegates who are going to be participating in that meeting.
[2560.70 → 2564.70] And that includes myself and then Darryl Wins and Brenda Alabama.
[2564.70 → 2576.70] And so if you can hold us in your prayers on Wednesday night as we gather with the other leaders and churches to journey through these things as a community that's really important.
[2576.70 → 2583.70] And we get to share in that and hopefully lighten the load and burden of our brothers and sisters in faith.
[2583.70 → 2590.70] Additionally, we have been asked by Rosita if we would lift her up in prayer.
[2590.70 → 2594.70] And she's going through some health struggles and some other struggles in her life.
[2594.70 → 2599.70] And she is calling on us to pray for her and to uphold her.
[2599.70 → 2607.70] Now many of you know Rosita and so encourage you to also take this into your week of prayer as well.
[2607.70 → 2610.70] With those couple notes in mind, let's come to God in prayer.
[2615.70 → 2624.70] Holy God and Heavenly Father, we gather before you in this time of worship because you are great and glorious.
[2624.70 → 2631.70] We gather before you in this time of worship because you are majestic Lord Almighty.
[2631.70 → 2645.70] We gather before you in this time of worship because you have bid us come to enter into this holy space, to stand on this holy ground and to hear directly from you.
[2645.70 → 2649.70] In your presence we stand.
[2649.70 → 2658.70] To you, Lord God, we come in this time of prayer because you are sovereign over all the earth.
[2658.70 → 2662.70] You rule and reign with your powerful hand.
[2662.70 → 2671.70] And so we ask, Lord God, now that you would move your hand in the direction of your will and your glory.
[2671.70 → 2680.70] And that you would use us and our prayers here as part of your guiding and shaping history to your good and glorious ends.
[2680.70 → 2690.70] Father God, as we come, we come as those particularly mindful with our eyes wide open looking out around the world.
[2690.70 → 2696.70] We come knowing that there is struggle and hardship.
[2696.70 → 2704.70] Knowing that there is temptation and strife all around.
[2705.70 → 2711.70] We ask God that you would meet us in the midst of these dark nights.
[2711.70 → 2713.70] In the midst of the valley of the shadow.
[2713.70 → 2716.70] In the midst of our longing and our crying and our mourning.
[2716.70 → 2720.70] Asking that you would meet us here.
[2720.70 → 2728.70] And that in the power of your spirit you would lift us up and draw us to yourself and reveal your mighty face to us.
[2728.70 → 2738.70] And so, Lord God, we pray intercede in places of conflict and war.
[2738.70 → 2742.70] We pray bring peace.
[2742.70 → 2750.70] We pray, Lord God, that not only would the peace you bring be a ceasing of conflict and of death.
[2750.70 → 2753.70] But it would be a restoration to wholeness.
[2756.70 → 2765.70] And that from your hand we would know what it means to be fully human, fully alive to the glory of God.
[2765.70 → 2776.70] God, as we gather, we know that the synod, the annual gathering of leaders from the Christian Reformed Church is coming up.
[2776.70 → 2781.70] We know that the convening session is this week to name officers.
[2781.70 → 2785.70] And so, we ask that you would be at work in and through that process.
[2785.70 → 2787.70] Even as that happens online.
[2787.70 → 2793.70] Even as those of us who are delegates are preparing to go to Grand Rapids in June.
[2793.70 → 2801.70] We ask, Lord, that you would already now be opening our eyes to the work of your Holy Spirit among us.
[2801.70 → 2807.70] That you would already now be guiding us into all truth.
[2807.70 → 2811.70] And that you would move us forward as a church to the glory of your name.
[2813.70 → 2817.70] We pray, Lord God, that we wouldn't pursue our own ends and our own stories.
[2817.70 → 2821.70] But that we would be part of your work in the world.
[2821.70 → 2831.70] Father, we pray much the same for those of us who will be gathering on Wednesday nights with the classes meeting.
[2831.70 → 2837.70] We pray for our sister churches who are going through some very significant challenges and struggles.
[2837.70 → 2841.70] And ask that you would meet them in their pain.
[2841.70 → 2846.70] And that you would knit them together in the hope of your gospel.
[2846.70 → 2852.70] We pray for those leaders in the churches who are affected.
[2852.70 → 2857.70] Who are heartbroken and who have been offended against.
[2858.70 → 2864.70] We ask that you would bring hope and wholeness there as well.
[2865.70 → 2868.70] And God, we pray for those who are hurting in these places.
[2869.70 → 2873.70] We pray that you would meet them in their pain and in their trials.
[2873.70 → 2876.70] And that you would hold on to them.
[2876.70 → 2880.70] Wrap your loving arms of care around them.
[2880.70 → 2885.70] That they might look to you and you alone for hope and for satisfaction.
[2885.70 → 2891.70] God, as we draw a little bit closer now to our own community,
[2891.70 → 2900.70] we give you thanks and praise in the lives, in particular, of the university and college students who have graduated in this season.
[2900.70 → 2906.70] This last couple of weeks and these next few, there are graduation ceremonies happening all around us.
[2906.70 → 2911.70] And we give your name praise for completed seasons of life.
[2911.70 → 2917.70] We praise your name as students enter this time of transition to something new,
[2917.70 → 2920.70] whether it is career or work or more schooling.
[2920.70 → 2929.70] We pray, God, that in all of this, you would draw near to them, and you would give them hope and comfort.
[2933.70 → 2942.70] Father God, we pray a prayer of thanksgiving for those in our midst who you have called to serve.
[2942.70 → 2960.70] We thank you for your provision to that end and ask, Lord God, that you would bless the ministries of this church through the leaders and through the so many volunteers that step up and serve you through their work in this church.
[2960.70 → 2975.70] Father God, as we come before you, we come before you as well on behalf of our brothers and sisters here, on behalf of our church family.
[2975.70 → 2980.70] And so, with Judy Dijkstra, we want to pray for her friend, Vera.
[2980.70 → 2985.70] Vera has been in the hospital for a few weeks now with shingles.
[2985.70 → 2994.70] And so, we pray that you would bring healing to her, restore her, so that she can go back to her life as lived normally,
[2994.70 → 3000.70] that she can again connect with her friends like Judy and live their lives together.
[3000.70 → 3006.70] Father, we pray as well this time for Rose Vita.
[3006.70 → 3015.70] Ask that you would be near to her, that you would put your healing hand upon her, that you would wrap your caring arms around her,
[3015.70 → 3025.70] and that she would know the nearness of your love and the deep and ever-present power of the Holy Spirit in her and with her.
[3025.70 → 3034.70] And we pray, Lord God, that you would use us, her church family, to surround her in that and to make that real in her life.
[3034.70 → 3044.70] Help her not only to know it in the depths of her heart, but to see it as we live and come alongside of her.
[3044.70 → 3054.70] Father God, we want to pray as well for Pastor Kevin as he begins a one-week intensive course at Acts Seminary this week.
[3054.70 → 3061.70] We know that the demands on his time and his life and his family as a result of that will be significant.
[3061.70 → 3068.70] And we pray that you would bless them all in this season, in this busy week.
[3068.70 → 3076.70] God, we pray too for the camps that happened and are still concluding yet today, youth camp and cadets.
[3076.70 → 3084.70] We thank you for at least yet no reports of serious injury and for keeping people safe
[3084.70 → 3091.70] and for the ways that you have drawn the community together in those moments and times.
[3091.70 → 3097.70] And God, as we prepare to hear from Safe Families Canada next week,
[3097.70 → 3103.70] would you already be laying on our hearts the needs that you might be calling us to address as a church community
[3103.70 → 3108.70] or as individuals in this community in partnership with their work.
[3108.70 → 3116.70] And now, God, as we turn to your word, we ask that you would open the eyes of our hearts that we might see Jesus,
[3116.70 → 3125.70] that we might hear his voice, and that we might be transformed through the work of your word on our hearts and in our lives.
[3125.70 → 3134.70] Make us into the people that you are calling us to be, we pray, in Jesus' holy, holy name. Amen.
[3134.70 → 3136.70] Amen.
[3136.70 → 3140.70] Amen.
[3140.70 → 3142.70] Amen.
[3142.70 → 3148.70] I'm going to invite you to open your Bibles,
[3148.70 → 3154.70] and we're going to continue in our walking through the book of Romans,
[3154.70 → 3160.70] as we enter into the last chapter of the book of Romans together.
[3160.70 → 3164.70] We are going to read the first 16 verses.
[3164.70 → 3168.70] Now, I warn you in advance, these verses are full of a lot of names,
[3168.70 → 3174.70] and so we're going to work our way through them intentionally and carefully.
[3174.70 → 3180.70] But also, I'm going to encourage you, as you are able, just to keep your Bible open,
[3180.70 → 3186.70] so that if I make reference back to one of them, you can see where they are, or in partnership with whom, and the like.
[3186.70 → 3194.70] So, let's read together this, the beginning of the last chapter in the book of Romans.
[3194.70 → 3198.70] Romans 16, I'll start at verse 1.
[3198.70 → 3228.70] 
[3228.70 → 3258.70] 
[3258.70 → 3288.70] 
[3288.70 → 3318.70] 
[3318.70 → 3332.70] This is the word of the Lord.
[3332.70 → 3342.70] This is one of those Sundays where I think, wouldn't it be fun if we had someone not a pastor read the Scripture beforehand?
[3342.70 → 3350.70] As I begin, let me ask if you've heard this before.
[3350.70 → 3356.70] Show me your friends, and I will show you your future.
[3356.70 → 3362.70] Or maybe, you are the average of the five people closest to you.
[3362.70 → 3370.70] That's Jim John, who is ubiquitous over the internet with his quotes.
[3370.70 → 3371.70] Here's another one.
[3371.70 → 3376.70] Show me who your friends are, and I will tell you what you are.
[3376.70 → 3380.70] That's apparently from Vladimir Lenin, which kind of surprised me, but I couldn't prove that either,
[3380.70 → 3385.70] because it's, again, another one of those quotes that the internet kind of just throws everywhere.
[3385.70 → 3397.70] Point is, these are ubiquitous and everywhere-present internet memes that reveal to us, or try to show to us,
[3397.70 → 3404.70] that the people around you make you who you are.
[3404.70 → 3407.70] The people around you make you who you are.
[3407.70 → 3414.70] The point I want to press into with you this morning is how, and why is that true?
[3414.70 → 3418.70] And so this is what we're going to look at, just three quick areas.
[3418.70 → 3425.70] One, the idea that the community of faith shapes you, sustains you, and celebrates you.
[3425.70 → 3433.70] The community of faith shapes you, and sustains you, and celebrates you, or celebrates with you.
[3433.70 → 3436.70] So let's start at number one.
[3436.70 → 3445.70] The community you surround yourself with shapes you into the person you are and the person you are becoming.
[3445.70 → 3452.70] And so, of course, that means the type of community that you surround yourself with matters.
[3452.70 → 3466.70] Now, it turns out that the scope of those who influence you is actually much bigger than the five people that Jim John talked about.
[3466.70 → 3480.70] Back in 2011, the New England Journal of Medicine published an article that tracked the spread of obesity over 32 years in a large social network.
[3480.70 → 3487.70] The study looked at data from 1971 all the way to 2003 of over 12,000 people.
[3487.70 → 3490.70] And here's what they found.
[3490.70 → 3499.70] If a friend of yours becomes obese, you are 45% more likely to gain weight over the next two to four years.
[3499.70 → 3501.70] But get this.
[3501.70 → 3513.70] They found that if a friend of a friend of yours becomes obese, the likelihood of you gaining weight over the same time period, two to four years, goes up by 20%.
[3513.70 → 3518.70] Even if you don't know the friend of a friend.
[3518.70 → 3522.70] And then, here's the worst part, it goes even one degree of separation further.
[3522.70 → 3530.70] If a friend of a friend of a friend of yours becomes obese, you are 10% more likely to gain weight.
[3530.70 → 3534.70] I'm sorry to tell you, but it turns out your friends are making you fat.
[3534.70 → 3540.70] But so do their friends and their friends and their friends' friends.
[3540.70 → 3552.70] Using this same collection of data, 5,000 people now from 1983 to 2003, they measured individual happiness over a large social network.
[3552.70 → 3556.70] This was published in the British Medical Journal back in 2008.
[3556.70 → 3558.70] They found similar results.
[3558.70 → 3564.70] If your friend is happy, you are 12% more likely to be happy as well.
[3564.70 → 3568.70] And if your friend's friends are happy, you're 10% more likely.
[3568.70 → 3573.70] And then, if a friend of a friend of a friend is happy, you are 6% more likely to be happy.
[3573.70 → 3576.70] Now, you might hear that and go, 6% is not actually that much.
[3576.70 → 3586.70] But the same study found that if I were to give you a $10,000 raise, the net effect on your happiness would only be 2%.
[3586.70 → 3588.70] So think about that.
[3588.70 → 3591.70] 6% actually turns out to be quite significant.
[3591.70 → 3598.70] In no small way, you and who you are is determined and influenced by the company you keep.
[3598.70 → 3602.70] The people that you surround yourself with will change you.
[3602.70 → 3611.70] But actually, what you're seeing is that the people that they surround themselves with, and the people that they surround themselves with, will also change you.
[3611.70 → 3614.70] Will also influence you and impact you.
[3614.70 → 3617.70] Your community of influence matters.
[3617.70 → 3626.70] And so, part of what that means is that your influence in the community also matters.
[3626.70 → 3631.70] And it matters to more than just the people sitting next to you.
[3631.70 → 3636.70] It matters to the people they connect with in the week.
[3636.70 → 3643.70] And it matters to the people they connect with in the next week.
[3643.70 → 3645.70] And here's the thing, right?
[3645.70 → 3654.70] As a Bible-believing, God-fearing, Christian people, we shouldn't be surprised by this.
[3654.70 → 3660.70] Now, of course, we might not know the numbers, we might not know the statistics, but we know the ontology, right?
[3660.70 → 3671.70] We know the created reality that undergirds all of that, the reality behind the numbers, because we know that we are created for community.
[3671.70 → 3678.70] And all the way back in Genesis 1, the very beginning of the Bible, God looks at creation, he says it is very good.
[3678.70 → 3686.70] And then in Genesis 2, in the next story, he looks at Adam alone, and he says it's not good for man to be alone.
[3686.70 → 3692.70] Right? Because we're created in the image of God, Genesis 1 now, in the image of God, he created them.
[3692.70 → 3694.70] Male and female, he created them.
[3694.70 → 3704.70] Right? And so, part of what we're seeing here is that God himself exists in eternal community as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[3704.70 → 3709.70] The Godhead exists as a community within God's self.
[3709.70 → 3714.70] Three persons co-equal, never confounding, but one in divinity.
[3714.70 → 3718.70] Right? Trinity in unity and unity in trinity.
[3718.70 → 3729.70] And to be created in this image of the triune God is to be created for community and unity.
[3729.70 → 3737.70] And then it's one's relationship to the community that becomes porous and reciprocal.
[3737.70 → 3740.70] In that you impact her.
[3740.70 → 3744.70] And you impact him.
[3744.70 → 3752.70] What we put into the community matters for what you get out of the community.
[3752.70 → 3755.70] Proverbs 13, 21 puts it this way.
[3755.70 → 3759.70] It says, walk with the wise, become wise.
[3759.70 → 3762.70] A companion of fools suffers harm.
[3762.70 → 3766.70] Surround yourself with wise people.
[3766.70 → 3769.70] And it has the impact of becoming wise.
[3769.70 → 3772.70] You have the impact then of becoming wise yourself.
[3772.70 → 3774.70] Hang out with fools.
[3774.70 → 3777.70] And don't be surprised when you start to act like one.
[3777.70 → 3784.70] Now in the New Testament, the strength of this bond is actually only heightened for us.
[3784.70 → 3785.70] Right?
[3785.70 → 3789.70] In the New Testament, we start to learn that we are recreated.
[3789.70 → 3791.70] We are regenerated by the work of the Holy Spirit.
[3791.70 → 3794.70] We are born again as a family.
[3794.70 → 3795.70] Right?
[3795.70 → 3797.70] As brothers and sisters in Christ.
[3797.70 → 3801.70] We become brothers and sisters because of Jesus.
[3801.70 → 3807.70] Now another image that the New Testament uses for the church is a body.
[3807.70 → 3810.70] We talk about one body and many parts.
[3810.70 → 3812.70] And all the parts are required.
[3812.70 → 3817.70] All the parts are equal in fellowship even if the authority is different.
[3817.70 → 3818.70] Right?
[3818.70 → 3823.70] A foot and an eye and a hand and a mouth, we all play a part in the body.
[3823.70 → 3827.70] And without one of those parts, the body isn't complete.
[3827.70 → 3831.70] It's not whole.
[3831.70 → 3837.70] And what we are seeing here is that being part of the body matters and playing your part in the body matters.
[3837.70 → 3838.70] Right?
[3838.70 → 3842.70] Picking up on this, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15, 33, he says,
[3842.70 → 3844.70] Do not be misled.
[3844.70 → 3847.70] Bad company corrupts good character.
[3847.70 → 3856.70] Now, chapter 16 of Romans is for us a veritable,
[3856.70 → 3862.70] who's who of the Apostle Paul's support team.
[3862.70 → 3863.70] Right?
[3863.70 → 3867.70] The people who have come alongside him and sustained him and have influenced him.
[3867.70 → 3874.70] The people who have from the beginning and along the way been gathered by the Holy Spirit in the work that he is doing.
[3874.70 → 3882.70] People that the Holy Spirit has converted and people who have come alongside Paul in this work that he is doing.
[3882.70 → 3891.70] And in this chapter, Paul is simultaneously making introductions for these people to the church at Rome.
[3891.70 → 3897.70] He's saying, here are some of my fellow believers and co-labourers, dear friends in the Lord.
[3897.70 → 3902.70] And he's commending them to the church in Rome, whom Paul hasn't yet met.
[3902.70 → 3908.70] He's commending them to receive them and to welcome them and to listen to them.
[3908.70 → 3913.70] Effectively, what Paul is saying is that these are the people who shape me.
[3913.70 → 3915.70] These are the people who sustain me.
[3915.70 → 3920.70] These are the people who celebrate what God is doing in and through this work.
[3920.70 → 3933.70] And what we get in these last verses of the book is a window into Paul's experience of how this community shapes him and how the people around him matter.
[3933.70 → 3936.70] Maybe you saw the language as we went through, right?
[3936.70 → 3940.70] In these verses, Paul is talking about co-workers.
[3940.70 → 3943.70] That is, people who have shared in the labour, who have come alongside him.
[3943.70 → 3946.70] And he talks about dear friends.
[3946.70 → 3950.70] These are people he has lived with and worked with.
[3950.70 → 3955.70] These are people he has loved and been loved by.
[3955.70 → 3966.70] Now, as we go through this list, for instance, we know that Paul lived with Priscilla and Aquila for a year and a half.
[3966.70 → 3985.70] He met them on one of his missionary journeys in the city of Corinth after they had moved out of Italy, probably even out of the city of Rome, because Emperor Claudius, who reigned from AD 41 to AD 54, he kicked all the Jews out of Rome.
[3985.70 → 3988.70] You can read about that in Acts 18.
[3988.70 → 3993.70] And because they were kicked out of Italy, they moved and went and settled to Corinth.
[3993.70 → 3996.70] And that's where they met Paul.
[3996.70 → 4000.70] And we learned that Priscilla and Aquila are also tentmakers like him.
[4000.70 → 4004.70] And so they worked together, and they lived together and they ministered together.
[4004.70 → 4009.70] And that time, that year and a half, would have shaped him deeply.
[4009.70 → 4011.70] He goes on.
[4011.70 → 4021.70] He mentions the fact that Androids and Julia, in verse 7, are outstanding among the apostles that they were in Christ before I was.
[4021.70 → 4033.70] We don't take it lightly, the fact that Paul calls these two people, probably a married couple, outstanding among the apostles.
[4033.70 → 4037.70] And that he notes that they were in Christ before he was.
[4037.70 → 4041.70] He has a respect for them, and he defers to them in some respects.
[4041.70 → 4042.70] Right?
[4042.70 → 4049.70] He's clearly influenced by who they are and the sharing of life that they've done together.
[4049.70 → 4050.70] He goes on.
[4050.70 → 4057.70] In verse 13, you read about the mother of Rufus, who has been a mother to me too, says Paul.
[4057.70 → 4064.70] The mothers are some of the most important people in shaping who you are and who you are becoming.
[4064.70 → 4079.70] Now, for most of these people, in fact, quite extensively for all of them, we don't know exactly how or in what way these people have influenced Paul.
[4079.70 → 4086.70] But we could reasonably deduce that they have been used by God to shape him.
[4086.70 → 4087.70] Right?
[4087.70 → 4097.70] As one writer said, these become a list of tough friends for tough times.
[4097.70 → 4098.70] Right?
[4098.70 → 4103.70] Because the right people around you makes you strong.
[4103.70 → 4109.70] And these tough friends will sustain him in the faith, which is the second point.
[4109.70 → 4110.70] Right?
[4110.70 → 4118.70] That the community of faith sustains you in the journey of life.
[4118.70 → 4132.70] And the American Society for Training and Development found that people are 65% more likely to meet a goal after they commit that goal to another person.
[4132.70 → 4135.70] It is after you tell someone else.
[4135.70 → 4147.70] And the chances of success of meeting that goal actually go up to 95% when you build in personal one-on-one meetings with the people you tell.
[4147.70 → 4148.70] Right?
[4148.70 → 4151.70] So they can check in on your progress and hold you accountable.
[4151.70 → 4155.70] Now, again, as Christians, of course we know this to be true.
[4155.70 → 4156.70] Right?
[4156.70 → 4161.70] We've always talked about the role of disciples going out two by two.
[4161.70 → 4162.70] Right?
[4162.70 → 4166.70] And of accountability and mutual encouragement.
[4166.70 → 4180.70] And so, Paul says of Phoebe in the first verse, she's a deacon in the church of Kendra, and she's been a benefactor to many people including him.
[4180.70 → 4188.70] In fact, he goes on, and he lists a bunch of other women, additional women, who have worked hard in the Lord.
[4188.70 → 4193.70] Or Persis, who's a woman who has worked very hard in the Lord.
[4193.70 → 4203.70] Now, again, we don't know exactly what that work looks like or what it consisted of, but for Paul to have mentioned it means that it's one, worthy of honour and recognition.
[4203.70 → 4208.70] And two, that that work encourages him in the work he does.
[4208.70 → 4214.70] In fact, one of the women who are mentioned is Mary.
[4214.70 → 4219.70] Mary, who worked very hard for you, Paul says.
[4219.70 → 4227.70] And this one is interesting to me because Paul mentions how Mary has worked very hard for you, for the Roman church.
[4227.70 → 4234.70] So, they might not even know her, but Paul does, and he's saying she's worked very hard for you.
[4234.70 → 4240.70] Now, for those of you who are curious, Mary is a very common name for Jewish women.
[4240.70 → 4246.70] And it relates to the Aramaic Miriam or the Hebrew Miriam.
[4246.70 → 4253.70] And so, this may be one of the Marys we've already met in the Gospels because we know three of them, at least three, probably four.
[4253.70 → 4262.70] I suspect, and this is just my suspicion, that this is the Mary who's mentioned as the mother of Mark.
[4262.70 → 4263.70] Right?
[4263.70 → 4268.70] The mother of John Mark, who's the author of the second Gospel and was one of Paul's missionary partners.
[4268.70 → 4270.70] But I have no proof of that.
[4270.70 → 4272.70] But I think that's who it is.
[4272.70 → 4278.70] The bigger point here in all of this is that all of these women have worked hard for the kingdom
[4278.70 → 4283.70] and their work is sustaining and encouraging Paul in the work that he's doing.
[4283.70 → 4291.70] And this sort of sustaining work goes beyond the provisions and encouragement.
[4291.70 → 4292.70] Right?
[4292.70 → 4297.70] Again, Paul tells us that Priscilla and Aquila, what does he say?
[4297.70 → 4300.70] They risked their lives for me in verse 4.
[4300.70 → 4301.70] Right?
[4301.70 → 4307.70] Androids and Julia, again, Paul says, who have been in prison with me.
[4307.70 → 4308.70] Right?
[4308.70 → 4318.70] Apelles in verse 10, we read that his fidelity to Christ stood the test, which probably means he was persecuted.
[4318.70 → 4327.70] So not only are the people on this list those who have supported Paul, who've worked hard in the Lord with him,
[4327.70 → 4333.70] but there's a bunch of people on this list who have suffered with him and who have sustained him in his own suffering.
[4333.70 → 4341.70] Which is just the working out of Galatians 6 verse 2, which says, carry each other's burdens.
[4341.70 → 4344.70] In this way you fulfill the law of Christ.
[4344.70 → 4351.70] And when Paul talks about the law of Christ, he's talking about the command of Christ to love each other.
[4351.70 → 4352.70] Right?
[4352.70 → 4360.70] And the way that we love each other, the way that we reveal Jesus to each other is in part by carrying each other's burdens.
[4360.70 → 4365.70] By entering into the struggles and the hardships and the challenges together.
[4365.70 → 4370.70] And this isn't just about external burdens, right, or material struggles.
[4370.70 → 4372.70] We can go even further.
[4372.70 → 4384.70] Think about the incredibly personal and the all too private struggle that so many of us have with different sins.
[4384.70 → 4389.70] Think about the role of confession then.
[4389.70 → 4394.70] We pray prayers of confession every week in our worship together.
[4394.70 → 4395.70] Sometimes they're spoken and shared.
[4395.70 → 4399.70] Sometimes they're silent and in your own hearts between you and God.
[4399.70 → 4411.70] And when we pray in this silence, I just wonder, do we experience confession the way that the psalmist does in Psalm 32?
[4411.70 → 4414.70] I'm going to read that for you.
[4414.70 → 4415.70] Psalm 32.
[4415.70 → 4416.70] The psalmist says,
[4416.70 → 4424.70] When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.
[4424.70 → 4428.70] For day and night your hand was heavy on me.
[4428.70 → 4431.70] My strength was sapped as in the heat of summer.
[4431.70 → 4435.70] Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity.
[4435.70 → 4442.70] I said, I will confess my transgressions to the Lord and you forgave the guilt of my sin.
[4442.70 → 4448.70] And then he ends, rejoice in the Lord and be glad you righteous.
[4448.70 → 4452.70] Sing all you who are upright in heart.
[4452.70 → 4471.70] When we confess here in our worship, do you move from that silence, wasting away, groaning agony of sin through confession to the rejoicing and the being glad and the singing?
[4471.70 → 4483.70] And if you struggle with experiencing that here or in your own life, use the community that God has given us.
[4483.70 → 4484.70] Right?
[4484.70 → 4485.70] Tell someone.
[4485.70 → 4488.70] Confess this thing to someone.
[4488.70 → 4490.70] Confess it with them.
[4490.70 → 4491.70] Confess it with them.
[4491.70 → 4493.70] And then see what God does in your experience.
[4493.70 → 4499.70] See how God might minister to your heart as they minister to you and share the truth of the gospel.
[4499.70 → 4503.70] That if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive.
[4507.70 → 4512.70] If you listen to the Narthex podcast, you heard me make reference to this.
[4512.70 → 4517.70] There's a 20th century German pastor by the name of Dietrich Bonhoeffer.
[4517.70 → 4528.70] He was a pastor and theologian who was eventually killed by the Nazis for his insurgency work against the regime.
[4528.70 → 4533.70] He said in a short little book that he wrote, he said the following.
[4533.70 → 4541.70] A man who confesses his sins in the presence of a brother knows that he is no longer alone with himself.
[4541.70 → 4546.70] He experiences the presence of God in the reality of the other person.
[4546.70 → 4552.70] And as long as I am by myself in the confession of my sins, everything remains in the dark.
[4552.70 → 4556.70] But in the presence of a brother, the sin has to be brought into the light.
[4556.70 → 4563.70] But since the sin must come to light sometime, it is better that it happens today between me and my brother,
[4563.70 → 4568.70] rather than on the last day in the piercing light of the final judgment.
[4568.70 → 4573.70] It is a mercy that we can confess our sins to a brother.
[4575.70 → 4582.70] This community of faith sustains you because you are never alone.
[4582.70 → 4586.70] Not even in the sin that makes you think you're so alone.
[4586.70 → 4596.70] When Jesus says, I will never leave you nor forsake you, one of the ways that he makes that a reality is by giving you this body,
[4596.70 → 4601.70] by giving you a community, a family, a church to always be with you.
[4601.70 → 4605.70] And let me be abundantly clear, this is the task of everyone.
[4605.70 → 4608.70] This isn't just the pastor up front.
[4608.70 → 4609.70] Right?
[4609.70 → 4619.70] All of us in the priesthood of all believers are called to hear and to be present with each other in the midst.
[4619.70 → 4620.70] Right?
[4620.70 → 4625.70] In fact, the first place that this happens is not in some prime position,
[4625.70 → 4631.70] but it is in the ordinary membership of the body living out ordinary life together.
[4631.70 → 4632.70] Right?
[4632.70 → 4639.70] Not just friends who are Christian, but actually Christian friends.
[4639.70 → 4641.70] Right?
[4641.70 → 4646.70] Friends who are Christian are those who you might sit beside on Sunday,
[4646.70 → 4649.70] but it doesn't change anything about the way you interact together.
[4649.70 → 4656.70] Christian friendship is built on this truth, these principles,
[4656.70 → 4661.70] that the community of faith shapes you, sustains you, and celebrates you.
[4661.70 → 4663.70] Which is our final point.
[4663.70 → 4666.70] The community of faith celebrates you.
[4666.70 → 4669.70] And here, hear me carefully.
[4669.70 → 4670.70] Right?
[4670.70 → 4676.70] I'm not saying that our task here is to puff you up with an inflated sense of self-worth.
[4676.70 → 4677.70] Right?
[4677.70 → 4683.70] Often you might hear today that all we need to have is a renewed sense of self-worth.
[4683.70 → 4687.70] That if I'm just true to myself, I can be my authentic self.
[4687.70 → 4693.70] I can be who I am as I am without other people telling me what's right for me or what's wrong for me.
[4693.70 → 4698.70] Then, finally, will I feel alive and full and valuable.
[4698.70 → 4701.70] The problem is, of course, right?
[4701.70 → 4713.70] If we attach our feelings of, or if we attach our sense of value to an internal feeling that we need outside affirmation for,
[4713.70 → 4721.70] well, I don't know about you, but my feelings are pretty fickle, and they change in a whim, and they always fall short.
[4721.70 → 4728.70] When I say that we celebrate you, we celebrate each other, what I mean is we rejoice with you.
[4728.70 → 4729.70] Right?
[4729.70 → 4734.70] What I mean is that we cheer you on in the race of perseverance that we are called to.
[4734.70 → 4736.70] This perseverance of faith, right?
[4736.70 → 4737.70] Right through to the end.
[4737.70 → 4741.70] The Bible has a picture of this, actually, in Hebrews 12.
[4741.70 → 4743.70] Hebrews 12 says,
[4743.70 → 4748.70] Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses,
[4748.70 → 4752.70] let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles,
[4752.70 → 4756.70] and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us,
[4756.70 → 4761.70] fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith.
[4761.70 → 4763.70] Now, picture that for a minute.
[4763.70 → 4769.70] The author of Hebrews is using an image for faith and encouragement for perseverance
[4769.70 → 4772.70] that is really replete throughout the New Testament.
[4772.70 → 4776.70] And it's the idea of athletic games, particularly of a race.
[4776.70 → 4782.70] Now, these kinds of games happened in cities all over the Roman Empire all the time.
[4782.70 → 4788.70] Rulers and governors and the emperor himself would put on games,
[4788.70 → 4793.70] usually at great expense to themselves, in order to entertain the masses
[4793.70 → 4797.70] and probably to keep them paying their taxes.
[4797.70 → 4810.70] And for the Greco-Roman culture, the gymnasium is just as central part of urban civilized living as the temple is.
[4810.70 → 4817.70] And in the first century BC, the largest Roman stadium is called the Circus Maximus.
[4817.70 → 4823.70] And it held 180,000 people.
[4823.70 → 4826.70] Some estimates say that goes up to a quarter million people.
[4826.70 → 4832.70] Now, to be really clear, that dwarfs even the largest stadiums today.
[4832.70 → 4836.70] The largest stadium in the world today is in Ahmedabad, India,
[4836.70 → 4838.70] and it's called the Narendra Mode Stadium.
[4838.70 → 4842.70] It's a cricket stadium that holds 132,000 people.
[4842.70 → 4848.70] The next one is Rung ado Mayday Stadium in Pyongyang, North Korea.
[4848.70 → 4851.70] It's a soccer stadium that holds 114,000 people.
[4851.70 → 4858.70] And then rounding out the rest of the top ten list are a bunch of American football university stadiums
[4858.70 → 4861.70] that all have over 100,000 people.
[4861.70 → 4870.70] The point is, right, athletic games in the time of Paul and the other members of the New Testament here
[4870.70 → 4876.70] is just as popular and just as central to the shaping of society as they are today.
[4876.70 → 4883.70] Perhaps even more so, actually, when you consider that the global population during this time
[4883.70 → 4887.70] is estimated to be about 300 million people.
[4887.70 → 4890.70] That's smaller than the population of the U.S. currently.
[4890.70 → 4892.70] All over the world.
[4892.70 → 4895.70] And here you have a stadium that holds 180,000.
[4895.70 → 4899.70] You can do the math on the percentages, but that's pretty high.
[4899.70 → 4904.70] Stadiums are full of people cheering on the athletes.
[4904.70 → 4909.70] And the author of Hebrews is saying that's what it's like to be a Christian.
[4909.70 → 4917.70] To be surrounded by a stadium full of people cheering you on in your life of faith.
[4917.70 → 4925.70] Part of what it means to be a community is to have the responsibility to encourage our brothers and sisters into faith.
[4925.70 → 4928.70] To cheer them on in perseverance and to development.
[4928.70 → 4931.70] Calling them to fix their eyes on Christ.
[4931.70 → 4935.70] And it's not just, as we read in Hebrews 12, those saints who are alive.
[4935.70 → 4939.70] It's all of us from all history who are part of the church.
[4939.70 → 4941.70] Militant and triumphant.
[4941.70 → 4942.70] Alive and dead.
[4942.70 → 4944.70] Visible and invisible.
[4944.70 → 4946.70] Calling us forward in faith.
[4946.70 → 4950.70] That's what it means to be part of a community of faith.
[4950.70 → 4958.70] In the last verse of our text, Paul makes this point.
[4958.70 → 4963.70] He says, all the churches of Christ send greetings.
[4963.70 → 4966.70] Think about how profound that is.
[4966.70 → 4974.70] First, it's profound in the sense that Paul can, with the authority of an apostle, speak for all the churches.
[4974.70 → 4979.70] Because it's the Holy Spirit speaking through him, inspiring his words to be the words of God.
[4979.70 → 4980.70] Right?
[4980.70 → 4991.70] This alone is profound because Paul is saying, all the churches encourage you and celebrate you and long to shape and sustain you in what you are doing.
[4991.70 → 4998.70] But it's also profound because all those saints are out there, recognizing, welcoming, and folding.
[4998.70 → 5004.70] To use the language that we have here, shaping, sustaining, and celebrating this church in Rome.
[5004.70 → 5006.70] Right?
[5006.70 → 5016.70] This short line at the end of our text from chapter 16 is a picture for us of Hebrews 12 as a cloud of witnesses.
[5016.70 → 5021.70] This is what we get to do together.
[5021.70 → 5030.70] Now, in our family at home, I regularly talk with my kids about speaking words of life.
[5030.70 → 5038.70] Now, this comes from Proverbs 18, verse 21, that says, the tongue has the power of life and death.
[5038.70 → 5047.70] And so, when we say mean or hurtful things to each other, we're speaking death.
[5047.70 → 5053.70] When you talk bad about people here, you're speaking death.
[5053.70 → 5061.70] Instead, how can you speak life in this community?
[5061.70 → 5067.70] And how can you use words that are filled with the power of life?
[5067.70 → 5072.70] And so, here's a check for you and one that I incorporate in my own life, right?
[5072.70 → 5085.70] Before you say anything critical, ask yourself, am I speaking life right now or am I speaking death?
[5085.70 → 5096.70] Because some of us, and again, I'll put my own heart in this, some of us need to confess the words of death
[5096.70 → 5103.70] that we have said about someone else in this room or not in this room.
[5107.70 → 5113.70] This is what it means for the community of faith to celebrate you.
[5113.70 → 5117.70] That the community of faith speaks life into your life.
[5117.70 → 5120.70] That the community of faith speaks encouraging words.
[5120.70 → 5128.70] That the community of faith, instead of hurting people or gossiping or slandering or talking down to them, let alone to them,
[5128.70 → 5131.70] lifts people up with our words.
[5131.70 → 5132.70] Right?
[5132.70 → 5136.70] We build people up in life so that faith may persevere.
[5136.70 → 5137.70] Right?
[5137.70 → 5141.70] What you say and how you say it matters.
[5141.70 → 5144.70] In the church, right?
[5144.70 → 5149.70] Here, of all places, let's encourage each other.
[5149.70 → 5151.70] Let's celebrate each other.
[5151.70 → 5152.70] Right?
[5152.70 → 5157.70] The community of faith shapes you and sustains you and celebrates you.
[5157.70 → 5164.70] And so this is where I will end because this, I believe, pulls it all together.
[5164.70 → 5171.70] All of this, this community, this faith, this community of faith that shapes you and sustains you and celebrates you,
[5171.70 → 5175.70] all of this is a gift.
[5175.70 → 5179.70] It is a gift of God in the work of the Holy Spirit.
[5179.70 → 5180.70] Right?
[5180.70 → 5182.70] You didn't build this community yourself.
[5182.70 → 5188.70] You didn't merit this community or inherit this community because you figured it all out.
[5188.70 → 5189.70] Or because you earned it.
[5189.70 → 5192.70] Or because you've stood out above the rest and said,
[5192.70 → 5195.70] yes, now you belong to me.
[5195.70 → 5199.70] The truth is that you and I are elected to this community.
[5199.70 → 5203.70] We are predestined to this community before the foundation of the world.
[5203.70 → 5204.70] Right?
[5204.70 → 5210.70] Adopted as sons and daughters of God and made into an heir of God and a co-heir with Christ.
[5210.70 → 5217.70] God himself becomes our heavenly Father, and he chose you out of all humanity.
[5217.70 → 5227.70] He gave you his son, and you belong to him, which means by grace through faith you belong to each other.
[5227.70 → 5232.70] Because Jesus lived the life I should have lived and died the death that I deserved.
[5232.70 → 5233.70] Right?
[5233.70 → 5237.70] It is because Jesus is the bridegroom that I have become a part of the bride.
[5237.70 → 5248.70] It is because Jesus gave up his own body on the cross so that I can be a part of his body in this life and in the life to come.
[5248.70 → 5252.70] You see, Jesus is the gospel.
[5252.70 → 5259.70] And now you and I get to live that gospel.
[5259.70 → 5267.70] Part of what it means to live the gospel is experienced in how we shape each other.
[5267.70 → 5271.70] It is experienced in how we sustain each other.
[5271.70 → 5278.70] And it is experienced in how we celebrate each other.
[5278.70 → 5280.70] You are not your own.
[5280.70 → 5286.70] You were bought body and soul by your faithful Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[5286.70 → 5293.70] And not only has he given you himself, he has given you one another.
[5293.70 → 5298.70] And that is a most beautiful gift of God.
[5298.70 → 5299.70] Amen?
[5299.70 → 5300.70] Let's pray.
[5300.70 → 5308.70] Let's pray.
[5308.70 → 5315.70] Holy and glorious Father, I praise your name for the gift of brothers and sisters.
[5315.70 → 5328.70] I praise your name for the gift of those who share this common identity, who share this common union with you by grace through faith in Christ Jesus.
[5328.70 → 5335.70] And I pray, Lord God, that you would use each of us here to speak words of life.
[5335.70 → 5343.70] That you would use each of us here to shape one another into the image of Jesus Christ more and more.
[5343.70 → 5350.70] I pray that you would use each one of us here to sustain each other, tough friends for tougher times.
[5350.70 → 5356.70] And I pray that you would use each one here to celebrate one another.
[5356.70 → 5363.70] To call us forward to fix our eyes on you, Lord Jesus.
[5363.70 → 5370.70] And that together, together we might make much of your name in our midst.
[5370.70 → 5376.70] Together we might go forward from this place proclaiming your kingdom come and your kingdom coming.
[5376.70 → 5383.70] That together we might go from this place as one united in faith and hope.
[5383.70 → 5387.70] Pray this, Jesus, in your name alone.
[5387.70 → 5388.70] Amen.
[5396.70 → 5397.70] Let's stand together.
[5397.70 → 5412.70] Still culture, Father
[5412.70 → 5430.38] He will be to the house of Zion.
[5430.38 → 5435.64] He will sing, our hearts be sore.
[5435.92 → 5440.38] And I pray things we will say together.
[5440.38 → 5470.36] He will be to the house of Zion.
[5470.38 → 5478.24] He will be to the house of Zion.
[5478.58 → 5483.42] He will sing, our hearts be sore.
[5483.68 → 5488.66] And I pray things we will say together.
[5488.66 → 5494.66] We will please and we go home.
[5494.66 → 5502.60] In the dark of night before the dawn.
[5503.52 → 5507.92] My soul in heart will break.
[5508.30 → 5512.66] For God is born beyond our love.
[5512.66 → 5520.66] Oh God, I pray that we might be safe.
[5521.36 → 5525.66] He will be to the house of Zion.
[5526.66 → 5530.66] He will sing, our hearts be sore.
[5530.66 → 5532.66] He will sing, our hearts be sore.
[5532.66 → 5536.66] He will sing, our hearts be sore.
[5536.66 → 5538.66] He will sing, our hearts be sore.
[5538.66 → 5542.66] He will sing, our hearts be sore.
[5542.66 → 5544.66] He will sing, our hearts be sore.
[5544.66 → 5548.66] He will sing, our hearts be sore.
[5548.66 → 5550.66] He will sing, our hearts be sore.
[5550.66 → 5554.66] He will sing, our hearts be sore.
[5554.66 → 5556.66] He will sing, our hearts be sore.
[5556.66 → 5562.66] He will sing, our hearts be sore.
[5562.66 → 5568.66] He will sing, our hearts be sore.
[5568.66 → 5574.66] He will sing, our hearts be sore.
[5574.66 → 5576.44] He will sing, our hearts be sore.
[5576.44 → 5577.90] He will sing, our hearts be sore.
[5578.74 → 5581.44] He will sing, our heart be sore.
[5584.78 → 5588.36] He will sing, our hearts be sore.
[5588.58 → 5591.54] He will sing, our hearts be sore.
[5591.54 → 5596.62] He will sing, our hearts be sore.
[5597.08 → 5599.44] He will sing, our hearts be sore.
[5599.62 → 5601.68] He will sing, our hearts be sore.
[5601.72 → 5604.10] He will sing, our hearts be sore.
[5604.10 → 5612.74] We will say together, we will please and we know more.
[5623.08 → 5627.54] As you go, know that God himself goes with you.
[5627.92 → 5629.54] Go also with two invitations.
[5629.82 → 5634.00] One, to hang around and fellowship in the community of faith.
[5634.36 → 5639.20] Together, have some time of coffee and refreshment.
[5639.38 → 5643.50] Encourage one another with your words and offer to pray for one another.
[5643.84 → 5648.90] If that comes up and a need is expressed, or a celebration is shared.
[5649.52 → 5652.46] Additionally, we will have prayer partners available here.
[5652.80 → 5655.26] If you'd like to meet someone, they will come up to the front.
[5655.26 → 5659.98] They'll have a yellow tag on, and they will meet you and pray with you there.
[5660.64 → 5662.96] Go with the blessing of our good God.
[5664.68 → 5666.80] God, go before you to lead you.
[5667.40 → 5669.42] God, go behind you to protect you.
[5669.72 → 5671.94] And God, go beneath you to support you.
[5672.30 → 5675.10] God, go beside you to befriend you.
