[5408.18 --> 5421.18]  In all creation I sing, praise to the King of kings, you are my everything, and I will adore you.
[5421.18 --> 5423.18]  I have my phone up here.
[5423.18 --> 5430.18]  Okay, so I wasn't going to do this, but now I feel like, compelled to do this.
[5430.18 --> 5433.18]  So please take a seat for just a moment.
[5433.18 --> 5442.18]  As you take a seat, some of you are going to think this is weird, just close your eyes, and listen.
[5442.18 --> 5449.18]  We've been in this space together, praying and singing, come Holy Spirit.
[5449.18 --> 5457.18]  We've been in this time, this hour and a bit of worship, inviting the Holy Spirit to come,
[5457.18 --> 5468.18]  and we've heard scriptures affirming over and over and over again that the Holy Spirit has come, that he is here.
[5468.18 --> 5476.18]  We are two or three gathered in the name of the Lord, and so he is here.
[5476.18 --> 5500.18]  And as we have come, as we have heard his presence, we are now invited to go, to go in the power of the Holy Spirit.
[5500.18 --> 5507.18]  But there is a great tragedy in the life of the Christian disciple.
[5507.18 --> 5522.18]  There is a great tragedy in the life of the church today that is functionally an atheistic Christianity.
[5522.18 --> 5532.18]  Someone who believes in Jesus and professes to believe in Jesus, and yet does not believe that God works in power by the Spirit.
[5535.18 --> 5539.18]  And doesn't ask God to work in that power.
[5540.18 --> 5543.18]  So here's the word I want you to hear.
[5543.18 --> 5554.18]  If you profess that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, that's the Spirit working in you, that belief.
[5554.18 --> 5566.18]  If you have experienced, even in a small measure, a growth in the fruit of the Spirit, of love and challenging and otherwise impossible situations, that's the Spirit at work.
[5566.18 --> 5575.18]  If you have experienced a sense of peace in the face of chaos and anxiety, that's the Spirit at work.
[5577.18 --> 5586.18]  If you have grown in patience when you are tried and under pressure, that's the Spirit at work.
[5586.18 --> 5589.18]  Church of God, the Spirit is still at work.
[5589.18 --> 5605.18]  And so as you go, go knowing that his power is real and his power is working in you and through you and for you to bring glory to God our Father.
[5605.18 --> 5606.18]  Amen?
[5606.18 --> 5607.18]  Amen.
[5608.18 --> 5612.18]  And so we go with the blessing of God.
[5612.18 --> 5613.18]  I invite you to stand.
[5613.18 --> 5614.18]  I invite you to stand.
[5614.18 --> 5615.18]  Hold out your hands.
[5615.18 --> 5616.18]  Open your heart.
[5616.18 --> 5620.18]  And receive the blessing of God.
[5620.18 --> 5627.18]  As we have invited the Holy Spirit to come, we are now invited by the Holy Spirit to go.
[5628.18 --> 5639.18]  And may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God the Father, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be and abide with you always.
[5639.18 --> 5642.18]  God's people said, Amen.
[5642.18 --> 5643.18]  Amen.
[5643.18 --> 5646.18]  Amen.
[5655.18 --> 5661.18]  Yea, above all names
[5661.18 --> 5669.88]  Worthy of all praise
[5669.88 --> 5673.84]  My heart will sing
[5673.84 --> 5681.76]  Great is our God
[5681.76 --> 5691.76]  The splendor of the King
[5691.76 --> 5696.64]  Bold in majesty
[5696.64 --> 5700.76]  Let all the earth rejoice
[5700.76 --> 5704.76]  All the earth rejoice
[5704.76 --> 5711.76]  He roused himself with eyes
[5711.76 --> 5717.76]  And darkness strives to hide
[5717.76 --> 5721.76]  And trembles at His voice
[5721.76 --> 5725.76]  And trembles at His voice
[5725.76 --> 5731.76]  How great is our God
[5731.76 --> 5733.76]  Sing with me
[5733.76 --> 5738.76]  How great is our God
[5738.76 --> 5740.76]  And all will see
