[0.00 → 3.00] Oh, I'm the prodigal
[3.00 → 8.00] I don't need the money
[8.00 → 12.30] I don't want the fame
[12.30 → 17.40] I don't want what I can't take with me
[17.40 → 19.00] In the grave
[19.56 → 22.24] Oh, and I don't want to lose my soul
[22.24 → 25.50] Chasing out the things that don't lead me
[25.50 → 32.10] Straight to you, and I'm lost in a feeling
[32.10 → 39.34] That I came from this world
[39.34 → 42.60] Going back to Eden
[42.60 → 44.76] Ain't going to be easy
[44.76 → 48.40] But it leads me straight to you
[48.40 → 50.50] And I'm running home
[50.50 → 53.50] Like the prodigal
[55.50 → 58.56] I don't want to lose my soul
[58.56 → 61.70] Chasing out the things that don't lead me
[61.70 → 63.64] Straight to you
[63.64 → 65.88] I don't want to lose my gaze
[65.88 → 67.68] When I meet you face to face
[67.68 → 70.18] Well done, well, come on
[70.18 → 72.30] Now I'm running home
[72.30 → 75.20] Like the prodigal
[75.20 → 80.14] Oh, I'm lost in a feeling
[80.14 → 87.46] That I came from this world
[87.46 → 90.80] Going back to Eden
[90.80 → 92.92] Ain't going to be easy
[92.92 → 96.46] But it leads me straight to you
[96.46 → 98.38] Now I'm running home
[98.38 → 102.20] Like a prodigal
[102.20 → 105.38] I'm lost in a feeling
[105.38 → 123.36] Like a prodigal

[127.32 → 157.30] Like a prodigal
[157.32 → 161.42] GL Journey
[161.42 → 162.46] I'm lost in a feeling
[162.46 → 163.48] I'm running home
[163.48 → 166.10] I'm searching for a dying
[166.10 → 167.60] Like a prodigal
[167.60 → 167.62] I'm collapsing
[167.62 → 169.30] Well, I'm losing my erk tai
[169.30 → 170.46] Life is no
[170.50 → 173.94] All I need is pen
[173.94 → 175.38] And even
[175.38 → 176.50] Lately
[176.50 → 178.24] I'm losing my feet
[178.24 → 178.82] But we couldn'tpod
[178.82 → 179.86] Like a prodigal
[179.86 → 180.80] Like a prodigal

[3574.28 → 3604.26] Thank you.
[3604.26 → 3634.24] today.
[3634.26 → 3664.24] We're going to do.
[3664.24 → 3694.22] And everybody stand up.
[3694.22 → 3724.20] Thank you.
[3724.22 → 3754.20] Thank you.
[3754.20 → 3784.18] Thank you.
[3784.18 → 3814.16] Thank you.
[3814.16 → 3844.16] Thank you.
[3844.16 → 3874.14] Lord, that you're going to do.
[3874.14 → 3904.12] Thank you.
[3904.12 → 3934.12] Thank you.
[3934.12 → 3964.12] Thank you.
[3964.12 → 3994.10] Thank you.
[3994.12 → 4024.10] Thank you.
[4024.12 → 4054.10] Thank you.
[4054.12 → 4084.10] Thank you.
[4084.12 → 4114.10] Good morning.
[4114.10 → 4144.10] Thank you.
[4144.10 → 4174.10] Thank you.
[4174.10 → 4204.10] And you're going to do.
[4204.10 → 4234.10] Thank you.
[4234.10 → 4264.10] Thank you.
[4264.10 → 4294.10] Thank you.
[4294.10 → 4324.10] 
[4324.10 → 4354.10] Thank you.
[4354.10 → 4384.10] 
[4384.10 → 4414.10] Thank you.
[4414.10 → 4444.10] Thank you.
[4444.10 → 4474.10] God's power.
[4474.10 → 4504.10] Thank you.
[4504.10 → 4534.10] Thank you.
[4534.10 → 4564.10] And you're going to do.
[4564.10 → 4564.26] 
[4594.10 → 4600.20] powerful here, but it becomes even more powerful when we come to understand that the pagan gods
[4600.20 → 4606.60] that the Canaanites believed in, they were nature worshippers, and they believed that their gods
[4606.60 → 4612.58] lived in those mountains. Again, at the top of our screen there, that those false gods lived
[4612.58 → 4620.36] in the mountains that this storm is just wreaking havoc on. David is saying that the Lord has no time
[4620.36 → 4627.14] for these puny, impotent gods. He comes, and he shakes their little houses with thunder and flashes of
[4627.14 → 4634.86] lightning, shakes their houses with merely his voice. Think of this as like a big bad wolf and
[4634.86 → 4640.02] three little pigs situation, except the pigs are the false gods, and they never really got into
[4640.02 → 4646.30] masonry, and they're actually completely made up. And then God is not really a big bad wolf. He's
[4646.30 → 4652.44] actually a perfect, big, powerful God who controls everything by the power of his voice.
[4653.18 → 4658.64] And now a quick note for you theology students, don't compare the God of the cosmos to the big
[4658.64 → 4666.84] bad wolf because it's a terrible analogy, but you get the idea. This storm starts in the waters.
[4667.22 → 4675.82] It moves onto land. It thunders the largest mountains. It snaps the largest trees where these made-up homes
[4675.82 → 4681.98] to these made-up gods live. And then in verses 8 and 9, it continues, the voice of the Lord moves this
[4681.98 → 4689.28] storm south, shaking the deserts of Pradesh, again at the bottom of the map there, and it twists the oaks
[4689.28 → 4700.36] and strips the forest bare along the way. The whole land, from sea to sky, from east to west, from north to south,
[4700.36 → 4713.52] is utterly dominated by this storm, by the voice of God, his power, his sovereign authority over all things.
[4714.52 → 4721.96] And in one poem, in seven verses in the middle there, we read how God is not in nature.
[4721.96 → 4733.22] God speaks, and nature is. God is not in nature. He made it, and he controls it. And while we're
[4733.22 → 4739.56] encouraged, of course, to enjoy nature, we should always remember that we are not made to worship
[4739.56 → 4747.42] nature or turn it into an idol, thinking that God is in it somehow. Because as great as nature is,
[4747.42 → 4754.54] it is nothing compared to the God who created and controls it with merely a voice.
[4756.68 → 4762.06] The voice of God here is over the waters and the mountains. The voice of God is powerful
[4762.06 → 4769.10] and majestic. It thunders and snaps unbreakable things. The voice of God strikes and shakes and
[4769.10 → 4775.16] twists. The voice of the Lord creates and controls. Throughout the whole Bible, Genesis 1,
[4775.16 → 4783.54] God speaks, and the world is created. In Genesis 6 and 15 and 17 and in Exodus and in all the
[4783.54 → 4789.74] promises we read this morning and sang to this morning, God speaks, and his promises are fulfilled.
[4792.86 → 4798.52] He will be theirs, and they will be his, and he will redeem us all from their sin.
[4798.52 → 4806.44] These promises spoken by God and fulfilled both already and not yet in the life, death, and
[4806.44 → 4812.22] resurrection of Christ his Son and in his future return when he will come and usher in the new
[4812.22 → 4817.84] heaven and the new earth. That is the awe and the wonder of the voice of God.
[4817.84 → 4824.96] And so what voice do we listen to?
[4826.96 → 4835.60] What are the voices that we submit to in our world? What voice dominates our narratives?
[4835.60 → 4845.52] What voice dominates our narratives? What voice dominates our narratives? What voice dominates our
[4845.52 → 4853.12] culture quite loudly? The self-help book genre was still flying off the shelf in 2023 as people desire
[4853.12 → 4858.40] to be better, whatever that means, but they're looking for any edge over other people to improve
[4858.40 → 4865.76] themselves by working hard. Again, improving however that means. Books like Outlive, which is a book
[4865.76 → 4872.32] helping us achieve longevity in this world, or Hidden Potential, a book about meant to help you become
[4872.32 → 4879.44] more successful in this world, or a book called 4,000 Weeks, Time Management for Mortals, a book about
[4879.44 → 4885.92] managing your time well, which I find ironic. Or if you would rather take your advice from famous people,
[4885.92 → 4891.76] a couple more top self-help books that came out last year, Build Your Life, or Build the Life You
[4891.76 → 4898.48] Want by Oprah Winfrey, no doubt an easy bar for us all to achieve. Or Be Useful, Seven Tools for Life
[4898.48 → 4905.76] by Arnold Schwarzenegger, hopefully tools that the average person can lift. The point is those self-help
[4905.76 → 4913.68] voices are out there, and they're loud. Maybe those voices aren't distracting us. Maybe we're more
[4913.68 → 4919.20] distracted by the political voices out there. Political platforms, they speak to issues that we care about.
[4919.76 → 4924.96] And those voices, they start to echo in our hearts and in our heads and eventually in our echo chambers online.
[4925.52 → 4932.64] We align ourselves with a party, be it conservative or liberal or NDP, and we feel the need to bleed into
[4932.64 → 4938.80] American politics even. And we align ourselves and set up camp with our Democrat friends or our Republican friends,
[4938.80 → 4943.76] and we start to think we better stick to everything that this platform is saying, lest we be accused of
[4943.76 → 4949.68] being an outsider or unloyal, which that's not a word. And we allow the voices of political jargon just to
[4949.68 → 4958.40] keep our feet firmly planted in whatever camp that we feel we need to land in. And our fingers just firing
[4958.40 → 4964.00] away on online posts threatening the voices of our political platform that we've become numb to hearing
[4964.00 → 4970.48] over and over again. We got to defend that political stance, right? Or maybe it's not self-help or maybe
[4970.48 → 4978.32] it's not political voices we hear too loudly, but maybe it's the voices of online influencers that are
[4978.32 → 4984.48] ringing in our ears. The social media world is vast, and the voices there are copious. There's always
[4984.48 → 4992.16] athletes like Cristiano Ronaldo to keep tabs on. You can do that along with 787 million other people
[4992.16 → 4998.96] following him online. Or actors like Selena Gomez with her 499 million followers. Or maybe the most
[4998.96 → 5007.52] listened to artist in 2003 or 2023. Who was the most listened to musician in 2023? Anyone? Taylor Swift.
[5007.52 → 5013.84] That's right. She's always trending, especially now that she basically owns the NFL. But it's not just
[5013.84 → 5019.60] celebrities online that carry influence. There's people online that you've probably never heard of.
[5019.60 → 5026.16] Michelle Lewin. She's a fitness influencer. You heard of her? 15 million people follow her, and they have
[5026.16 → 5032.80] her help them with their health. A beauty influencer, Becky G. She has 34 million followers trying to look
[5032.80 → 5038.00] suave and sexy because of her influence. Or tech influencer, I think some of you will know this one,
[5038.00 → 5044.16] Mark Robert. He's got 23 million subscribers, and he can show you all sorts of avenues to pursue in the
[5044.16 → 5055.04] world of popular science and engineering. But honestly, it's not even the well-known influencers on social
[5055.04 → 5060.72] media with millions of followers that affect us the most online. Though they are the voices that perhaps
[5060.72 → 5069.12] speak the loudest. Generally, it's your friends or your family, the people that you follow to see how life is
[5069.12 → 5075.92] going. The posts you read and the voices you hear from the people you love and see either daily or
[5075.92 → 5084.24] weekly or monthly or perhaps annually. So many are listening to the voices on social media. They see
[5084.24 → 5090.72] their posts. They see their pictures. The lives they share. We compare, and we contrast, and we wish and we
[5090.72 → 5096.32] can dream that our lives could be like that and none of its real. Because all of it is just glimpses.
[5096.32 → 5103.12] Mostly posed glimpses of moments in time where things are going really well.
[5105.12 → 5114.08] And it's crippling a lot of us who compare what they see online, compare what they see on the socials
[5115.12 → 5122.00] with what they experience in their own life. These are the voices in the world. These are the voices
[5122.00 → 5128.56] competing for your attention, be it self-help, be it politics, be it online forums and social media.
[5128.56 → 5134.80] These voices are out there. And I think if we have any self-awareness at all, we know that they're there.
[5136.80 → 5139.60] So what voices are you listening to?
[5139.60 → 5145.12] What voices are dominating your narrative, dominating your story?
[5146.72 → 5153.04] Celebrity musings on bettering yourself? Political platforms meant to entrench you firmly? Social media
[5153.04 → 5158.64] influencers inviting you to compare what they've got and what you have?
[5158.64 → 5168.16] Now please hear this. This is not meant to be some rant like an old man sitting on his rocking chair on the
[5168.16 → 5173.20] front porch of his house just yelling at people to get off of his lawn, something that I aspire to be one day.
[5173.20 → 5184.80] There is a place for self-help books, though discerning the good ones from the cash grabs is important. There is a place for political loyalty.
[5185.44 → 5189.92] So long as we understand that the platforms we align with are as depraved as we are,
[5190.72 → 5195.52] and we are obligated to separate the good from the bad of any party that we support.
[5196.32 → 5200.88] There's a place for social media, even following helpful media influencers.
[5200.88 → 5213.20] So long as we are not blinded by their posts and thrust into some depression or anxiety because our everyday lives aren't as shiny as the three seconds that they demonstrate for us online.
[5214.80 → 5218.56] The fact that these voices exist is not the problem.
[5220.96 → 5228.00] The problem is that these voices drown out the only voice that does.
[5228.00 → 5232.16] The voice that is powerful and majestic.
[5233.36 → 5239.20] The voice that creates and controls the voice of the Lord that we see so powerfully in our text today.
[5240.40 → 5247.04] The voice of the Lord is getting drowned out by self-help sections and social media doom-scrolling.
[5247.04 → 5256.72] I remember years ago, when I was a teenager, which is becoming more and more years ago as the calendars flip,
[5257.36 → 5261.60] I was playing soccer for a rep team on Vancouver Island where I grew up.
[5262.00 → 5268.32] I must have been in grade 10 or 11 because as the competition increased and as the level of play got better and better,
[5268.32 → 5273.92] the parental involvement on the sidelines got louder and louder.
[5275.44 → 5279.44] Now, I'm sure many of you high school or even university athletes can relate to that.
[5279.44 → 5281.36] Perhaps a lot of you parents can relate to that.
[5281.36 → 5288.00] I don't know what it is about high school sports, but whatever it is, it usually brings out the most obnoxious of our adult friends, doesn't it?
[5288.80 → 5290.88] Anyway, early on in this particular season,
[5290.88 → 5296.24] our team was becoming aware that the parents of us were becoming louder and louder.
[5297.36 → 5300.72] They were yelling at calls made by the referees or the linesmen.
[5300.72 → 5305.04] There was cheers of excitement or yells of frustration.
[5305.60 → 5307.44] They seemed to be happening more regularly.
[5308.00 → 5312.80] We even had four or five games that year when parents got red cards and got kicked off of the field.
[5312.80 → 5316.92] And I think more parents got kicked out that season than players on my soccer team.
[5316.92 → 5326.76] But perhaps the most problematic was that parents were regularly yelling instructions to us, to their kids, to the players,
[5327.56 → 5331.32] explaining where they should go, what passes they should be doing, who should be supporting you,
[5331.32 → 5335.00] what runs they should be doing, what set plays should be happening on free kicks,
[5335.40 → 5342.28] and generally just backseat coaching with limited knowledge of the game or the tactics that we are trying to pull off.
[5342.28 → 5349.64] Well, in a lesson that I will never forget, in one of his pre-game pep talks, our coach pulled the whole team aside,
[5349.96 → 5352.04] and he said this, and I will remember this always.
[5352.04 → 5358.20] He said, guys, you're hearing a lot of voices out there, a lot of parents telling you what you should do or shouldn't do.
[5358.92 → 5361.48] I need you to ignore all of it.
[5362.28 → 5363.40] Don't acknowledge them.
[5363.80 → 5364.84] Don't look at them.
[5365.48 → 5366.60] Don't respond to them.
[5367.32 → 5368.60] Ignore it all completely.
[5368.60 → 5372.04] You need to just listen to my voice.
[5372.92 → 5378.46] If you listen to me, we will be unified, and we will be able to accomplish what we set out to accomplish.
[5379.00 → 5380.24] Ignore everyone else.
[5383.48 → 5389.48] So how do we make sure that the Lord's voice is the one that we are hearing?
[5389.48 → 5396.70] How do we make sure that it is the Lord's voice we hear amongst all the other voices out there?
[5397.60 → 5402.44] How do we cut through the distracting voices around us because they're going to be there?
[5403.74 → 5404.56] That's a given.
[5406.40 → 5410.12] Psalm 29 gives us the right posture to do this.
[5412.22 → 5413.74] Ascribe and worship.
[5414.28 → 5415.50] Notice verses 1 and 2.
[5415.62 → 5418.64] David teased this up right from the start.
[5418.64 → 5421.40] Ascribe to the Lord, you heavenly beings.
[5421.60 → 5424.18] Ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.
[5424.36 → 5426.72] Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name.
[5427.22 → 5431.04] Worship the Lord in the splendour of his holiness.
[5431.56 → 5434.94] Ascribe, ascribe, ascribe, worship.
[5436.40 → 5437.54] There's repetition again.
[5437.54 → 5444.24] The word ascribe here is the Hebrew word yah av, which means to give or to acknowledge, to honour.
[5444.96 → 5445.92] Acknowledge the Lord.
[5446.12 → 5446.82] Honour the Lord.
[5446.98 → 5448.50] Give the Lord glory.
[5448.62 → 5449.14] He is due.
[5449.46 → 5451.46] And finally, worship the Lord.
[5451.46 → 5462.20] In order to allow the voice of the Lord to be heard above the surrounding noise, we are first and foremost to acknowledge him for who he is.
[5463.26 → 5466.46] It starts with acknowledging him above all the noise.
[5466.66 → 5468.74] Honouring him amongst the noise.
[5469.18 → 5471.72] Glorifying him despite the noise.
[5472.06 → 5474.92] And worshipping him not the noise.
[5474.92 → 5481.04] Psalm 29 starts with this refrain in order to put God above all things.
[5482.24 → 5493.44] And then, after we have heard of this great and powerful storm caused by God's voice, we see it come back to the same spot that it started in verse 9.
[5493.96 → 5498.44] And all, and in his temple, all cry glory.
[5498.44 → 5498.56] Glory.
[5500.20 → 5504.06] This psalm starts with glory, and it ends with glory.
[5504.16 → 5512.88] The bookends of this psalm teach us that our response to the king over all creation is to first and foremost, above all things, acknowledge him.
[5514.90 → 5516.32] Worship him.
[5517.26 → 5522.48] God's power over creation declares him as king and calls us to worship him.
[5522.48 → 5528.96] So again, with us, the question for you today, for me today, is this.
[5529.66 → 5530.54] Do we do that?
[5531.86 → 5532.82] Do we do that?
[5532.92 → 5535.82] Do we acknowledge him above all things?
[5536.76 → 5540.00] What do we recognize first and foremost in our lives?
[5540.56 → 5542.12] What comes first for us?
[5542.80 → 5543.92] Do we start our days?
[5544.02 → 5544.86] Do we start our weeks?
[5544.94 → 5546.72] Do we start our lives glorifying?
[5547.86 → 5551.26] Because what we worship is what we're often ruminating on.
[5552.48 → 5555.78] So real, just quick, what comes first in your life?
[5556.42 → 5558.04] Scripture or screens?
[5559.76 → 5561.22] Prayers or posts?
[5562.72 → 5568.00] In the morning, are you quicker to turn your phone on and scroll your way through what's happening in the social media world?
[5568.68 → 5570.26] Or open up the Bible app?
[5571.26 → 5574.22] Is it more natural for you to listen to your favourite news anchor?
[5574.50 → 5576.74] Or to turn on some worship music and praise his name?
[5576.74 → 5581.04] Are you quicker to respond to your friend's Instagram story?
[5582.06 → 5584.76] Or comment perhaps on the latest news article you read?
[5585.82 → 5590.18] Or kneel before the Lord and offer him the glory that he deserves?
[5591.82 → 5594.22] Does your day start and end with God?
[5594.56 → 5596.80] Or start and end with some other voice?
[5596.80 → 5601.12] Maybe that's what our resolution should be this year.
[5601.20 → 5605.54] Maybe as a manual CRC, we decide every day to look at Scripture before screens.
[5605.86 → 5608.00] Maybe as a church, we pray before we post.
[5608.66 → 5611.18] And if that seems too pointed and direct for you, that's fine.
[5611.22 → 5611.60] I get it.
[5611.88 → 5615.56] I get some people don't love prescribed applications telling you how to live your life.
[5615.70 → 5616.48] And that's cool.
[5616.56 → 5620.26] You don't have to follow these specific instructions if you're bristling at it.
[5620.26 → 5625.40] But maybe, maybe we're bristling because this is hitting home a little.
[5627.02 → 5628.40] So think about it.
[5629.58 → 5633.36] What voices are you putting first in your life?
[5633.88 → 5637.28] What voice influences you most in your day to day?
[5637.98 → 5642.08] Every day, every week, in your coming, in your going, what comes first?
[5643.54 → 5644.42] God's voice?
[5645.82 → 5647.72] Or the voices we see in this world?
[5647.72 → 5656.80] And what can you do to ensure that being heard, that the only voice that matters is being heard above the noise?
[5659.68 → 5660.96] I'm going to conclude here.
[5661.28 → 5664.86] The end of Psalm 29 tells us why this matters so much.
[5665.78 → 5667.08] Verses 10 and 11 says this.
[5667.28 → 5669.64] The Lord sits enthroned over the flood.
[5670.20 → 5672.12] The Lord is enthroned as king forever.
[5672.50 → 5674.44] The Lord gives strength to his people.
[5674.44 → 5677.48] The Lord blesses his people.
[5677.72 → 5678.50] With peace.
[5679.68 → 5681.54] The Lord is over the flood.
[5681.90 → 5682.92] And is king forever.
[5683.26 → 5686.02] He gives strength to his people every day.
[5686.46 → 5690.50] And he blesses us with peace.
[5693.18 → 5693.82] Peace.
[5694.20 → 5698.42] This theme of receiving peace from our God is a theme throughout scripture.
[5698.56 → 5700.14] Romans 5, 1-2 says this.
[5700.14 → 5706.10] Since we have just been, or since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[5706.24 → 5711.50] Through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand.
[5711.76 → 5713.60] Philippians 4, verse 7 says this.
[5713.60 → 5721.96] And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
[5721.96 → 5726.24] Church, the 6 o'clock news makes us depressed.
[5726.24 → 5728.98] The socials just bring us anxiety.
[5729.20 → 5734.48] The noise of politics drives us to obnoxious rants in comment sections online.
[5734.48 → 5741.02] But the voice of the Lord brings us peace, which transcends all understanding.
[5741.02 → 5747.84] Giving the king of glory the worship he deserves above all.
[5749.50 → 5751.98] Beyond the distracting voices of the world.
[5752.10 → 5755.16] This will allow us to receive this transcendent peace.
[5755.34 → 5759.80] Which is only available because we worship a transcendent God.
[5759.80 → 5767.54] Because the voice of God that creates and controls even the most powerful storms that we read about in Psalm 29.
[5767.96 → 5773.82] Is the same voice that came down from heaven and dwelt with his people.
[5774.94 → 5777.32] Just a couple of weeks ago we celebrated Christmas.
[5778.16 → 5783.00] The day we remember, and we celebrate the transcendent God who came to be with us.
[5783.30 → 5784.54] God with us.
[5784.70 → 5785.06] Emmanuel.
[5785.06 → 5785.18] Emmanuel.
[5786.22 → 5793.62] In fact, when our Lord was born, the angels sang portions of Psalm 29 to the shepherds.
[5793.66 → 5795.08] In Luke 2.13 we read,
[5795.16 → 5799.58] Suddenly there was a multitude of heavenly hosts praising God and saying,
[5800.30 → 5802.16] Glory to God in the highest heaven.
[5802.28 → 5803.84] Verse 1 of Psalm 29.
[5804.08 → 5807.74] And peace on earth to the people he favours.
[5808.48 → 5809.74] Verse 11 of our psalm.
[5810.86 → 5815.00] The voice of God came down to earth to be with us all.
[5815.28 → 5824.72] In fact, the gospel truth of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection is so often centred on the fact that the voice or the word of God was active and present with his people.
[5826.36 → 5827.68] John 1 verse 1.
[5827.76 → 5830.42] The Christmas message from John's gospel says this.
[5830.70 → 5833.28] The word became flesh and dwelt amongst us.
[5833.36 → 5835.04] The word became flesh.
[5835.12 → 5836.04] Matthew 3.17.
[5836.04 → 5837.16] Jesus gets baptized.
[5837.80 → 5839.84] And the voice of God calls down from heaven.
[5840.20 → 5842.82] This is my son whom I am well pleased.
[5843.96 → 5844.96] Or whom I love.
[5845.02 → 5846.12] With him, I am well pleased.
[5846.20 → 5847.36] In Matthew 17.5.
[5847.40 → 5848.92] At the transfiguration of Christ.
[5849.14 → 5852.02] The voice of God calls down once more and says a similar thing.
[5852.30 → 5854.10] This is my son whom I love.
[5854.16 → 5856.00] With him, I am well pleased.
[5856.42 → 5857.38] Listen to him.
[5857.38 → 5859.84] In John 6.68.
[5859.98 → 5862.74] Peter, one of Jesus' disciples, says to Christ,
[5863.16 → 5865.72] You have the words of eternal life.
[5866.44 → 5869.82] We have come to believe and know that you are the Holy One of God.
[5870.80 → 5871.84] Mark 4.39.
[5872.28 → 5876.16] Jesus is on this boat and a large storm comes and terrifies his disciples,
[5876.36 → 5878.58] many of whom are expert fishermen.
[5878.58 → 5884.78] And he comes out on deck, and he calms the storm saying simply,
[5885.64 → 5886.00] Quiet.
[5886.54 → 5887.18] Be still.
[5888.24 → 5890.26] Proving he is God.
[5890.52 → 5891.98] Lord over the flood.
[5892.64 → 5893.84] As Psalm 29 says.
[5894.58 → 5895.88] And all of this matters.
[5896.42 → 5900.08] Because the voice of God who controls the storms of this world,
[5900.38 → 5902.64] who speaks everything into existence,
[5903.10 → 5905.22] came down, put on flesh,
[5905.64 → 5907.76] experienced this life that we live.
[5907.76 → 5910.76] He lived the life that we all should have lived.
[5910.86 → 5914.10] And then he died the death that you and I all deserve to die.
[5914.44 → 5916.60] And with his voice on the cross,
[5916.74 → 5917.62] he proclaimed,
[5918.08 → 5919.90] Father, forgive them,
[5920.18 → 5921.72] for they do not know what they do.
[5922.34 → 5924.54] And finally, with his voice, he cried out,
[5924.80 → 5925.66] It is finished.
[5927.26 → 5928.84] But then, three days later,
[5928.92 → 5930.48] that same word become flesh,
[5930.84 → 5931.82] rose from the dead,
[5931.90 → 5934.12] defeating sin and death once and for all.
[5934.18 → 5936.12] He appeared to over 500 people
[5936.12 → 5937.58] before ascending to heaven,
[5937.58 → 5941.10] where he sits at God's right hand on the throne
[5941.10 → 5942.74] and uses his voice
[5942.74 → 5947.30] to mediate on behalf of all who come
[5947.30 → 5949.00] to him
[5949.00 → 5950.78] with repentant hearts,
[5951.58 → 5954.46] offering grace for all who believe.
[5954.46 → 5959.68] His voice is still active in your life.
[5961.42 → 5962.50] In my life.
[5962.84 → 5965.88] That same voice was there at the beginning of time,
[5966.30 → 5968.38] speaking over the storm in Psalm 29.
[5968.88 → 5970.24] And then, one day,
[5970.98 → 5972.18] this voice came down
[5972.18 → 5974.92] and was cooing to his mother as a baby.
[5976.34 → 5977.42] This voice grew up,
[5977.54 → 5979.08] calmed the storms once again,
[5979.08 → 5981.08] and declared the truth of his purpose
[5981.08 → 5982.96] and the fulfillment of his promises
[5982.96 → 5983.78] for generations.
[5983.96 → 5984.74] And this voice
[5984.74 → 5986.14] is now speaking
[5986.14 → 5988.30] for you
[5988.30 → 5991.12] by his Father's throne in heaven.
[5993.66 → 5994.22] Speaking
[5994.22 → 5995.64] to you
[5995.64 → 5996.98] through the words
[5996.98 → 5997.92] of Scripture.
[5997.92 → 6001.08] Jesus, the voice of God
[6001.08 → 6002.52] is speaking to you today,
[6002.82 → 6003.58] saying the words
[6003.58 → 6005.00] of Matthew 11, 28,
[6005.46 → 6006.14] Come to me,
[6006.24 → 6007.70] all you who are weary
[6007.70 → 6008.68] and burdened,
[6008.68 → 6011.44] and I will give you rest.
[6012.00 → 6012.94] His voice
[6012.94 → 6013.84] is there.
[6014.96 → 6015.96] He speaks to us
[6015.96 → 6016.72] through the Spirit,
[6017.08 → 6017.82] in your hearts,
[6017.96 → 6019.28] through your brothers and sisters,
[6019.52 → 6021.14] and powerfully through his word.
[6021.14 → 6022.84] Do you hear it?
[6024.70 → 6026.04] Or are the distractions
[6026.04 → 6028.76] and the voices of this world
[6028.76 → 6029.48] drowning it out?
[6030.76 → 6031.96] There are a lot of voices
[6031.96 → 6032.78] in the world today,
[6032.88 → 6033.44] but Jesus
[6033.44 → 6034.96] is speaking.
[6036.34 → 6037.60] Are we listening?
[6038.76 → 6039.08] Amen.
[6039.54 → 6040.34] Please pray with me.
[6042.62 → 6043.40] Father God,
[6043.50 → 6044.40] your voice
[6044.40 → 6046.40] has been there
[6046.40 → 6048.34] throughout the dawn of time.
[6048.44 → 6049.00] You spoke
[6049.00 → 6050.24] and this world was created.
[6050.24 → 6050.96] You spoke
[6050.96 → 6052.02] and promises were made.
[6052.10 → 6052.60] You spoke
[6052.60 → 6053.44] and you said
[6053.44 → 6054.48] you would be our God
[6054.48 → 6055.92] and we would be your people.
[6056.26 → 6057.24] And those words
[6057.24 → 6058.38] are true,
[6058.52 → 6059.86] have always been true,
[6059.88 → 6061.30] and will continue to be true.
[6062.20 → 6062.98] And yet, God,
[6063.04 → 6063.76] in this world,
[6063.84 → 6065.56] there are so many voices
[6065.56 → 6067.02] competing for space
[6067.02 → 6067.70] in our heads.
[6069.22 → 6070.52] God, may you
[6070.52 → 6072.70] cut through the noise.
[6074.18 → 6075.32] God, allow us
[6075.32 → 6076.58] the discipline,
[6077.22 → 6077.96] the effort,
[6078.94 → 6079.70] the determination
[6079.70 → 6080.62] and the will
[6080.62 → 6082.20] to cut through the noise
[6082.20 → 6083.30] to listen to you,
[6084.12 → 6085.58] to open up your words,
[6086.16 → 6087.64] to listen to how you speak
[6087.64 → 6088.14] through others
[6088.14 → 6089.06] into our lives,
[6089.76 → 6090.64] and to discern
[6090.64 → 6091.84] what it is you are calling
[6091.84 → 6092.88] for us to do
[6092.88 → 6093.66] each and every day.
[6095.36 → 6097.04] Lord, may you be the voice
[6097.04 → 6098.34] that rises above the rest
[6098.34 → 6099.06] in our lives.
[6099.52 → 6101.14] And may you bring us
[6101.14 → 6101.98] this year
[6101.98 → 6103.12] to a place
[6103.12 → 6103.92] where we allow that
[6103.92 → 6104.40] to happen.
[6105.14 → 6106.18] God, stir in our hearts
[6106.18 → 6107.34] what it is we need to do
[6107.34 → 6108.34] in our lives,
[6108.38 → 6108.96] what things need
[6108.96 → 6109.78] to be shaken up,
[6110.20 → 6111.00] what changes need
[6111.00 → 6111.48] to be made,
[6111.56 → 6113.68] so that we put your voice
[6113.68 → 6117.04] above the rest.
[6118.26 → 6119.00] And God, we pray this
[6119.00 → 6119.50] in your name.
[6120.20 → 6120.50] Amen.
[6124.26 → 6125.02] As we sing.
[6125.02 → 6143.94] God, God Dino,
[6143.94 → 6146.10] God says,
[6146.10 → 6167.06] O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder
[6167.06 → 6174.68] Consider all thy works, thy hands at me
[6174.68 → 6182.96] I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder
[6182.96 → 6190.62] Thy power through all the universe display
[6190.62 → 6199.18] Then cease my soul, my favour, God to me
[6199.18 → 6207.46] How great thou art, how great thou art
[6207.46 → 6215.18] Then cease my soul, my Saviour, God to me
[6215.18 → 6223.40] How great thou art, how great thou art
[6223.40 → 6231.68] And through the world, and for its faith I wander
[6231.68 → 6239.68] I hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees
[6239.68 → 6247.96] When I look down from lofty mountain tender
[6247.96 → 6255.16] And hear the brook, and feel the gentle breeze
[6255.16 → 6262.96] Then cease my soul, my Saviour, God to me
[6262.96 → 6271.24] How great thou art, how great thou art
[6271.24 → 6278.24] It sings my soul, my Saviour, God to me
[6278.24 → 6286.82] How great thou art, how great thou art
[6286.82 → 6288.82] How great thou art, how great thou art, how great thou art
[6288.82 → 6295.10] And when I think that God is sung not sparing
[6295.10 → 6303.10] Sent him to die, I scarce can take it in
[6303.10 → 6311.38] That on the cross, my burden gladly buried
[6311.38 → 6319.38] He bled and died to take away my sin
[6319.38 → 6327.10] And sings my soul, my Saviour, God to me
[6327.10 → 6329.10] How great thou art, how great thou art
[6329.10 → 6335.10] How great thou art, how great thou art
[6335.10 → 6343.10] It sings my soul, my Saviour, God to me
[6343.10 → 6351.10] How great thou art, how great thou art
[6351.10 → 6359.10] Then I shall come with shadow of acclimation
[6359.10 → 6367.10] And drink it home, for joy shall fill my heart
[6367.10 → 6375.10] Then I shall come in humble adoration
[6375.10 → 6377.10] And hear the brook, and help her son
[6377.10 → 6379.10] And hear the brook, my God to me
[6379.10 → 6383.10] How great thou art, how great thou art
[6383.10 → 6391.10] And sings my soul, my Saviour, God to me
[6391.10 → 6395.10] How great thou art, how great thou art
[6395.10 → 6399.10] How great thou art, how great thou art
[6399.10 → 6405.66] It sings my soul, my Saviour God to me.
[6407.12 → 6414.82] How brave thou art, how brave thou art.

[6463.00 → 6466.44] The Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[6466.86 → 6471.92] The Lord turn his face toward you and give you his peace.
[6472.42 → 6473.72] And all God's people said.
[6473.72 → 6474.22] Amen.
